1
00:00:04,571 --> 00:00:08,356
The French essayist,
Michel de Montaigne, once said...

2
00:00:08,456 --> 00:00:13,295
"I think there is more barbarity
in eating a man alive...

3
00:00:13,395 --> 00:00:15,940
than in eating him dead."

4
00:00:17,851 --> 00:00:19,842
The wisdom of it.

5
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:29,277
When you're a kid
with an open soul...

6
00:00:29,377 --> 00:00:32,422
they tell you the world
consists of good guys and bad guys.

7
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:39,671
I always liked the bad guys.

8
00:00:41,808 --> 00:00:44,333
Scarface over Superman.

9
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:51,165
The psychology of depravity was far more
compelling to my Manichaean imagination...

10
00:00:51,265 --> 00:00:54,709
than a portrait ofbenevolence.

11
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:03,858
The truth is, good and bad
are not so absolute.

12
00:02:15,101 --> 00:02:17,081
As for me...

13
00:02:17,181 --> 00:02:19,832
there are times I'd give a thumb
for a little benevolence.

14
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:22,217
You gave me a "D."
I don't get D's.

15
00:03:22,317 --> 00:03:25,553
When you do "D" work, you get a "D."

16
00:03:25,653 --> 00:03:27,320
We're fucking, Eli.

17
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:31,760
- What, you're fucking me for a good grade?
- No.

18
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:34,825
So I leave you with a question.

19
00:03:34,925 --> 00:03:39,065
A northern California dairy farmer
murders three young girls...

20
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:42,105
performs sexual acts
with their dead bodies...

21
00:03:42,205 --> 00:03:45,006
and then eats portions
of their fleshy thighs.

22
00:03:45,106 --> 00:03:47,139
Is the dairy farmer crazy?

23
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:49,342
Fuck, yeah.

24
00:03:49,442 --> 00:03:51,780
Let me give you a hint.
This is not a question...

25
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:55,857
that can be answered
with a "yes" or a "no" or a "fuck, yeah."

26
00:03:57,937 --> 00:04:00,154
Empty. Empty. Empty.

27
00:04:00,254 --> 00:04:02,765
Did you even buy
a cup of coffee today?

28
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:08,094
Just out of curiosity,
how many days old...

29
00:04:08,194 --> 00:04:10,877
is that raggedy cup
you keep filling with our free milk?

30
00:04:12,385 --> 00:04:15,866
- Three.
- So I'm gonna have to confiscate your cup.

31
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:26,491
I'm enjoying this...
so much.

32
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:34,623
Three pages on my desk by Monday.

33
00:04:34,723 --> 00:04:36,698
Thank you all.

34
00:04:42,348 --> 00:04:45,166
Just a second, you.
Next time you're late for this class...

35
00:04:45,266 --> 00:04:49,402
you're gonna trip on your way out
and break your shooting thumb.

36
00:04:49,502 --> 00:04:51,218
You get me?

37
00:05:11,756 --> 00:05:16,665
Right now I am stuck in a deep life rut here.
It's a grave... like trench.

38
00:05:16,765 --> 00:05:20,068
You see, I'm trying
to finish my Ph.D. thesis...

39
00:05:20,168 --> 00:05:24,574
and get by on a $35-a-week allowance
from my father, okay?

40
00:05:24,674 --> 00:05:28,673
So as much as I would love
to spend the $4.40 on a...

41
00:05:28,773 --> 00:05:31,410
Mocha Spin and a seeded baguette...

42
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,681
I am constantly reminded
of the words of Samuel Johnson...

43
00:05:34,781 --> 00:05:37,668
Why would you give
your own lover a "D"?

44
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:44,693
Beth, I am disappointed that you
would expect preferential treatment.

45
00:05:44,793 --> 00:05:47,758
It's bullshit, Eli.
It's bullshit.

46
00:05:47,858 --> 00:05:50,631
You're punishing me.
You are.

47
00:05:50,731 --> 00:05:54,536
You're punishing me for sleeping with you.

48
00:05:54,636 --> 00:05:57,438
"There mark what ills
the scholar's life assail...

49
00:05:57,538 --> 00:06:02,119
toil, envy, want,
the patron and the jail."

50
00:06:10,419 --> 00:06:13,451
- Hello. Speaking.
- The office got a call.

51
00:06:13,551 --> 00:06:16,531
Seems as though your husband
won the Nobel Prize.

52
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:22,079
Well, that should cement his ego.

53
00:06:23,783 --> 00:06:26,399
Hey, it's not every day
somebody wins the bowling trophy...

54
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:28,837
let alone the Nobel Prize.

55
00:06:28,937 --> 00:06:32,470
Barkley Michaelson,
your father called.

56
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,992
He has just won the Nobel Prize.

57
00:06:39,411 --> 00:06:42,414
Lucky fucking son of a bitch.

58
00:06:42,514 --> 00:06:46,598
Congratulations.

59
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:51,169
Congratulations, Dr. Michaelson.
You rock.

60
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,832
Thank you. Thank you.

61
00:07:01,932 --> 00:07:05,841
If anyone in this room
ever doubted my intellectual superiority...

62
00:07:05,941 --> 00:07:09,508
or your great fortune
to be under my incomparable tutelage...

63
00:07:09,608 --> 00:07:13,814
you can now formally
kiss my fine white ass.

64
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:24,242
- Congratulations, Eli.
- Congratulations, Eli.

65
00:07:25,912 --> 00:07:28,574
Good job.

66
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:37,473
Well, Eli, I guess this proves
the Nobel's not a popularity contest.

67
00:07:37,573 --> 00:07:39,807
And a good thing, Simon...

68
00:07:39,907 --> 00:07:42,759
'cause if it were, you might actually have
a shot at winning.

69
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,182
- Hey, Ma.
- Hey.

70
00:07:48,282 --> 00:07:49,949
- You look great.
- Thank you.

71
00:07:50,049 --> 00:07:52,151
Is this tie all right?

72
00:07:52,251 --> 00:07:56,659
Did someone forget to tell Dad
that this was a semi-formal affair?

73
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:59,026
He knew.

74
00:07:59,126 --> 00:08:01,192
Anything to crystallize
his advantage, huh?

75
00:08:01,292 --> 00:08:03,429
Where's the chow?

76
00:08:03,529 --> 00:08:06,165
Everyone's very proud of you, Eli.

77
00:08:06,265 --> 00:08:08,766
Well, it's a damn good thing
I won the Nobel...

78
00:08:08,866 --> 00:08:12,241
because now you're gonna
find it hard as hell to fire me.

79
00:08:12,341 --> 00:08:15,075
Oh, I never threatened
to fire you, Eli.

80
00:08:15,175 --> 00:08:18,778
I'm a scientist, Harvey, and the empirical
evidence I'm looking at around here...

81
00:08:18,878 --> 00:08:21,615
tells me no one loves me anymore.

82
00:08:21,715 --> 00:08:23,896
I loved you.

83
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:30,257
Eli. Look, I'm a scientist too...

84
00:08:30,357 --> 00:08:32,728
and my empirical
observations tell me...

85
00:08:32,828 --> 00:08:35,292
that someone's gonna shoot you
long before I have to fire you.

86
00:08:35,392 --> 00:08:38,930
Young lady... I'm closing my eyes.

87
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,567
Do you really think that little nymph
of a chemistry groupie...

88
00:08:42,667 --> 00:08:45,073
is having an affair
with my ancient, tyrannical dad?

89
00:08:45,173 --> 00:08:48,558
- Mom.
- No. Wait.

90
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:55,082
Nice of you to come, Beth.
Love the outfit.

91
00:08:55,182 --> 00:08:57,533
Final exams are in two weeks.

92
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:01,590
If I don't get an "A,"
I'm gonna tell the whole world...

93
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,424
about my scandalous affair with you.

94
00:09:04,524 --> 00:09:08,661
Unfortunately, it won't be the first
Nobel Prize winner with a sex scandal.

95
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:12,331
Yes, yes. Dr. Carleton Gajdusek
and his Micronesian boys.

96
00:09:12,431 --> 00:09:15,236
I think he was in another league...
sexually, that is.

97
00:09:15,336 --> 00:09:17,482
I'm so totally serious.

98
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:22,907
An "A" it is.
You earned it.

99
00:09:23,007 --> 00:09:25,914
I like you like this, Beth.

100
00:09:26,014 --> 00:09:28,079
You look naughty.

101
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:33,184
What I wouldn't do
to tear the clothes...

102
00:09:33,284 --> 00:09:36,537
right off your gorgeous little body
right this very second.

103
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,972
When I get back from Stockholm.
Now, go on. Get out of here.

104
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:57,909
She feels like I'm abandoning the class
two weeks before their final exam...

105
00:09:58,009 --> 00:10:01,647
which I am in effect doing
by going to Stockholm.

106
00:10:01,747 --> 00:10:04,552
You see, Simon?
At least my students are fond of me.

107
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:23,039
I'd like to thank you all for coming tonight.
Some of you willingly.

108
00:10:23,139 --> 00:10:27,206
Some of you in spite of yourselves.

109
00:10:27,306 --> 00:10:32,731
Tomorrow I'm off
to claim my Nobel Prize.

110
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:36,050
Joining me will be my wife, Sarah...

111
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:38,250
who, I am certain...

112
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:42,089
has only been able to put up with my manias
and eccentricities all these years.

113
00:10:42,189 --> 00:10:46,562
Because her definition
of "crazy" is so narrow.

114
00:10:46,662 --> 00:10:51,697
Hell, she convinced a jury
that Jeffrey Dahmer wasn't crazy...

115
00:10:51,797 --> 00:10:55,333
thus, of course, negating
his insanity defense...

116
00:10:55,433 --> 00:11:00,051
and engineering
his terminal incarceration.

117
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,184
Sarah.

118
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:10,749
And we will be accompanied
by my one and only son, Barkley...

119
00:11:10,849 --> 00:11:14,689
who has just about ensured that my work
in single... molecule spectroscopy...

120
00:11:14,789 --> 00:11:17,755
will not have a natural heir.

121
00:11:17,855 --> 00:11:23,198
With his summa cum laude degree
from Princeton under his belt...

122
00:11:23,298 --> 00:11:28,434
he has instead turned
his scholarly attentions to cannibalism...

123
00:11:28,534 --> 00:11:32,605
and the challenges of Gameboy.

124
00:11:32,705 --> 00:11:36,640
Now he just has
to figure out how to make a living...

125
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:40,047
out of such rarefied expertise.

126
00:11:40,147 --> 00:11:42,584
Barkley.

127
00:11:44,686 --> 00:11:46,920
In 1975 when "Love Will
Keep Us Together"...

128
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:50,954
- Go on. I'll cover for you.
- Thanks.

129
00:11:51,054 --> 00:11:53,495
Hey, good luck with that girl.
What was her name?

130
00:11:53,595 --> 00:11:55,058
- Nice try, Mom.
- Hey.

131
00:11:55,158 --> 00:11:58,764
Be there at 9:00.
The flight's 11:30.

132
00:11:58,864 --> 00:12:00,910
And it was then that I realized...

133
00:12:04,657 --> 00:12:07,340
that it was both possible
and necessary...

134
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:12,077
to observe the spectra
from single molecules...

135
00:12:12,177 --> 00:12:15,497
in condensed phases.

136
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:20,185
Yes! Yes!
Damp with come.

137
00:12:20,285 --> 00:12:22,252
I fell back onto the bench...

138
00:12:22,352 --> 00:12:26,175
and suddenly I could understand
the woodpeckers.

139
00:12:33,552 --> 00:12:38,170
- Has she read yet?
- No.

140
00:12:38,270 --> 00:12:40,473
Tits! Tits, tits, tits!

141
00:12:40,573 --> 00:12:42,550
Tits.

142
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,521
Thank you.

143
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,198
Hello. I'm City Hall.

144
00:13:03,298 --> 00:13:07,480
Tonight I'm going to read
from my "Rat Boy" poems.

145
00:13:14,827 --> 00:13:18,747
In the dark corners
of the more recessed cavities...

146
00:13:18,847 --> 00:13:22,312
of Rat Boy's
small and wicked mind...

147
00:13:22,412 --> 00:13:26,687
here is where the parasites of iniquity
gorge themselves.

148
00:13:26,787 --> 00:13:30,253
You might think him a beast,
treat him as pariah.

149
00:13:30,353 --> 00:13:32,823
You feign ignorance at insinuation.

150
00:13:32,923 --> 00:13:35,060
But you know...

151
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,399
in the dark corners of the more recessed
cavities of your own little mind...

152
00:13:39,499 --> 00:13:41,999
that your own fetid darkness...

153
00:13:42,099 --> 00:13:45,420
seethes in its unique mental waste.

154
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:06,460
Hey. Um, do you
remember me? Barkley?

155
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,262
I introduced myself a few weeks ago.

156
00:14:09,362 --> 00:14:12,532
That was just...
You're so...

157
00:14:12,632 --> 00:14:15,970
- God... good.
- Thank you.

158
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:20,476
I am sometimes able to speak
in complete sentences.

159
00:14:20,576 --> 00:14:22,741
There. That was one.

160
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:28,717
Suck my lips. Open yourself wide
to the great conquering me.

161
00:14:28,817 --> 00:14:30,781
I'd love to talk to you sometime...

162
00:14:30,881 --> 00:14:33,154
about your inspirations
or... whatever.

163
00:14:33,254 --> 00:14:36,889
- Okay.
- Okay. Like we can talk now?

164
00:14:36,989 --> 00:14:41,675
- Sure.
- Okay. Yeah.

165
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:45,562
I wish I could offer to buy you
a hamburger or something...

166
00:14:45,662 --> 00:14:49,071
- but I don't have any money at all right...
- I'm a vegetarian.

167
00:14:49,171 --> 00:14:51,837
That's a good thing,
especially if I ever have to eat you...

168
00:14:51,937 --> 00:14:57,475
because vegetarians,
they taste better than carrion eaters.

169
00:14:57,575 --> 00:14:59,847
You see, I'm doing my Ph.D.
thesis in anthropophagy...

170
00:14:59,947 --> 00:15:02,148
- Cannibalism.
- Yeah.

171
00:15:02,248 --> 00:15:06,020
- Everybody trivializes it, but there's a lot of...
- Who?

172
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:09,390
Some cruel, small-minded...

173
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:12,192
Republican parental figure?

174
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:15,244
He's a Democrat,
but the rest is accurate.

175
00:15:15,377 --> 00:15:16,660
Your father.

176
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,927
I had a father.

177
00:15:21,027 --> 00:15:24,713
He found my journals
when I was 15, and he burned them.

178
00:15:26,922 --> 00:15:29,307
My poems. My thoughts.

179
00:15:29,407 --> 00:15:32,074
My drawings.
Everything I was.

180
00:15:32,174 --> 00:15:34,140
Incinerated.

181
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,220
Oh, my God. H...

182
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:40,829
- How did you ever look at him again?
- I didn't have to. He died.

183
00:15:47,276 --> 00:15:50,973
"Love and pain become one and the same
in the eyes of a wounded child."

184
00:15:53,148 --> 00:15:56,584
"Hell is for Children."
Pat Benatar?

185
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:04,682
My bike.

186
00:16:05,761 --> 00:16:07,341
Shit.

187
00:16:07,441 --> 00:16:10,262
I have a car.

188
00:16:19,574 --> 00:16:23,427
- Halloween?
- Originally.

189
00:16:23,527 --> 00:16:25,863
Now I just wear them
to freak people out at stoplights.

190
00:16:25,963 --> 00:16:27,938
All right.

191
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:34,034
- A gift from me to you.
- No. It's too generous. I couldn't possibly accept.

192
00:16:34,134 --> 00:16:38,172
Don't take that off!
I gave it to you.

193
00:16:38,272 --> 00:16:40,694
You have to wear it.

194
00:16:57,312 --> 00:17:00,029
- So you're really broke?
- Yes.

195
00:17:00,129 --> 00:17:03,096
Prove it.
I wanna see your balance.

196
00:17:03,196 --> 00:17:06,120
- You're kidding, right?
- No.

197
00:17:07,889 --> 00:17:11,039
But you got to wear the mask.

198
00:17:11,139 --> 00:17:13,720
- I gave it to you. Come on.
- This is crazy. What?

199
00:17:15,964 --> 00:17:17,944
Crazy's just a choice, Barkley.

200
00:17:18,044 --> 00:17:20,228
Okay, okay.

201
00:17:21,636 --> 00:17:24,503
Hurry up, Barkley!
I'm hungry!

202
00:17:31,646 --> 00:17:34,171
You didn't lie to me, Barkley.

203
00:17:44,326 --> 00:17:46,474
Let's go back to my house.

204
00:17:46,574 --> 00:17:48,961
We could order some moo shu.
I'll pay.

205
00:18:08,283 --> 00:18:12,686
Do you have any idea
how talented you are?

206
00:18:13,955 --> 00:18:15,422
Okay.

207
00:18:32,441 --> 00:18:35,171
This is pretty, uh...

208
00:18:39,681 --> 00:18:44,641
You don't taste so bad to me,
carnivore that you claim to be.

209
00:18:47,422 --> 00:18:49,638
I promise you taste better.

210
00:18:49,738 --> 00:18:51,919
Whoa!

211
00:18:54,062 --> 00:18:56,826
Meet Marvel.
He's a thief.

212
00:18:58,033 --> 00:19:01,217
- Who morphs into a cat by night?
- No.

213
00:19:01,317 --> 00:19:03,283
He's a cat thief.

214
00:19:03,383 --> 00:19:07,190
He steals anything you leave lying around,
and then you never see it again.

215
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:10,438
That would make me somewhat anxious.

216
00:19:15,183 --> 00:19:16,616
Barkley.

217
00:19:19,387 --> 00:19:21,401
Am I beautiful?

218
00:19:21,501 --> 00:19:23,185
God, yes.

219
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,550
Don't hurt me.

220
00:19:27,929 --> 00:19:31,387
I won't, City.
I promise.

221
00:20:43,104 --> 00:20:45,787
- I have to go.
- No, no, no, no.

222
00:20:45,887 --> 00:20:49,592
I have to go to Stockholm today.
I'll call you before I get on the plane, okay?

223
00:20:49,692 --> 00:20:51,658
Or from the plane.
Or both.

224
00:20:51,758 --> 00:20:53,895
Stay, stay, stay, stay.

225
00:20:53,995 --> 00:20:58,499
Just touch me like you did last night.
Please, Barkley.

226
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,567
Okay, half hour.
Half hour I got to go.

227
00:21:05,961 --> 00:21:08,644
I hope nothing's happened to him.

228
00:21:08,744 --> 00:21:12,279
Nothing happened to him.
He probablyjust found a way to get laid.

229
00:21:12,379 --> 00:21:14,785
This is so typical of that kid.

230
00:21:14,885 --> 00:21:17,985
It's not typical of him.
He hasn't dated anyone since Meredith.

231
00:21:18,085 --> 00:21:22,021
And that cost me $20,000
for a marriage that lasted three minutes.

232
00:21:22,121 --> 00:21:24,943
They were married for over a year.

233
00:21:26,815 --> 00:21:31,168
Ah, to hell with him. If he's going to be
this irresponsible, we're going without him.

234
00:21:31,268 --> 00:21:33,232
Oh, Eli.

235
00:21:33,332 --> 00:21:35,414
I got rid of all my wallpaper.

236
00:21:37,459 --> 00:21:39,844
- I like it without the wallpaper.
- The thing is...

237
00:21:39,944 --> 00:21:42,510
I found out that wallpaper glue...

238
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:45,747
promotes the growth
of microorganisms.

239
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:48,551
The place looks terrific, George.

240
00:21:48,651 --> 00:21:52,490
I like it. And the flowering plants,
they really cheer the place up.

241
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:55,122
I'm living with pollen.

242
00:21:55,222 --> 00:21:57,690
I'm so...
The limo's here, and we're off now.

243
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:59,961
I'll water the plants...

244
00:22:00,061 --> 00:22:02,697
tend to the garbage...

245
00:22:02,797 --> 00:22:05,602
and I'll make sure
that the outside lights are out.

246
00:22:05,702 --> 00:22:09,405
- Okay.
- And I'll make you a detailed report.

247
00:22:09,505 --> 00:22:12,776
Oh, thank you, George.

248
00:22:12,876 --> 00:22:15,510
Could you just do me
one other small favor?

249
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:19,517
What was that favor?

250
00:22:19,617 --> 00:22:22,717
If you see Barkley, could you tell him
that his tickets are on the table...

251
00:22:22,817 --> 00:22:25,088
by the phone in the kitchen?

252
00:22:25,188 --> 00:22:27,153
But isn't he coming with you?

253
00:22:27,253 --> 00:22:31,128
Well, we can't seem to locate him.
I'm sure he's gonna be home any minute.

254
00:22:31,228 --> 00:22:33,563
He can take the car
and drive it to the airport.

255
00:22:33,663 --> 00:22:37,209
He can park it there.
Tell him I'll pay for the parking. Okay?

256
00:22:38,953 --> 00:22:41,704
Look, I'll look...
I'll look out for him.

257
00:22:41,804 --> 00:22:45,373
- Okay. Thank you.
- But I usually hear him come in with his bicycle.

258
00:22:45,473 --> 00:22:50,078
Because when he hangs it
on those hooks, the whole floor shakes.

259
00:22:50,178 --> 00:22:53,551
- Okay. Thank you, George.
- I have to leave in 74 minutes.

260
00:22:53,651 --> 00:22:56,229
- Okay...
- Sarah. Sarah.

261
00:22:57,572 --> 00:22:59,233
What if I don't hear him?

262
00:23:07,315 --> 00:23:10,409
Ah, shit.

263
00:23:13,088 --> 00:23:14,919
Shoes. Shoes.

264
00:23:23,498 --> 00:23:25,523
Pasadena. City Cab.

265
00:23:50,725 --> 00:23:53,660
Taxi! We got to go now.

266
00:23:55,096 --> 00:23:57,690
Ten.

267
00:24:00,468 --> 00:24:02,459
Keep the change.

268
00:24:11,079 --> 00:24:14,344
Mom? Dad?

269
00:24:17,786 --> 00:24:19,447
Hello!

270
00:25:25,465 --> 00:25:29,171
Hey, you've reached
the Michaelsons. Leave it at the beep.

271
00:25:29,271 --> 00:25:31,709
Barkley, this is City.

272
00:25:31,809 --> 00:25:35,409
I already know you're not gonna call me
like you promised because I know you're a liar.

273
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:37,948
You swore you didn't
have any money last night...

274
00:25:38,048 --> 00:25:40,012
and yet, you hired a cab
this morning.

275
00:25:40,112 --> 00:25:42,053
I saw it, Barkley, from my window.

276
00:25:42,153 --> 00:25:43,987
If you lied about that,
you probably lied about everything...

277
00:25:44,087 --> 00:25:46,721
and I just wanna end it right now.

278
00:25:46,821 --> 00:25:49,834
I won't be hanging around, okay?
Good-bye, Barkley.

279
00:25:52,925 --> 00:25:55,096
Hey, you've reached the Michaelsons.
Leave it at the beep.

280
00:25:55,196 --> 00:25:56,831
You're laughing.

281
00:25:56,931 --> 00:26:01,002
I can hear it in your voice.
You've lost your shadow, Barkley, your soul.

282
00:26:01,102 --> 00:26:04,942
That's how you can be such a monster
to me now and feel nothing.

283
00:26:05,042 --> 00:26:08,074
Hey, you've reached the...

284
00:26:08,174 --> 00:26:10,581
Enough! Will you shut
the fuck up already!

285
00:26:10,681 --> 00:26:12,780
Barkley, this is your father,
and I'm angry.

286
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,319
I just hope that whatever you're getting out
of your invidious behavior...

287
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:17,585
- is worth it.
- Oh, you're angry.

288
00:26:17,685 --> 00:26:19,753
Well, fuck you, Eli.
I'm angrier.

289
00:26:19,853 --> 00:26:23,800
And my invidious behavior
is going to be well worth it.

290
00:26:30,952 --> 00:26:33,887
Shh.

291
00:26:38,693 --> 00:26:41,111
George Gastner...

292
00:26:41,211 --> 00:26:43,845
reformed obsessive-compulsive...

293
00:26:43,945 --> 00:26:46,182
now faces a great
personal challenge.

294
00:26:46,282 --> 00:26:51,054
You can do it, George. You can do it.

295
00:26:51,154 --> 00:26:55,290
Forget Barkley.
Forget his worried mother.

296
00:26:55,390 --> 00:27:00,678
Get in your non-polluting electric car
and go to work.

297
00:27:03,785 --> 00:27:06,069
Bravo, George.
Bravo.

298
00:27:06,169 --> 00:27:08,803
All those years
at the Billingsworth Psychiatric Hospital...

299
00:27:08,903 --> 00:27:11,188
must have really paid off.

300
00:27:48,329 --> 00:27:52,115
If it's busy, then he's there.

301
00:27:52,215 --> 00:27:55,417
Damn it, Eli.
I told you we needed call waiting.

302
00:27:55,517 --> 00:27:59,086
- We really should be boarding, Mr. Michaelson.
- Doctor.

303
00:27:59,186 --> 00:28:02,621
Ms. Sighvatsson
is politely hinting...

304
00:28:02,721 --> 00:28:05,095
that the plane is leaving.

305
00:28:05,195 --> 00:28:08,273
And I, for one,
would like to be on it.

306
00:29:03,704 --> 00:29:05,695
Hello.

307
00:29:07,175 --> 00:29:09,155
Dr. Michaelson...

308
00:29:09,255 --> 00:29:13,462
the captain would like to say
how very pleased he is...

309
00:29:13,562 --> 00:29:16,630
to have you on board, sir.

310
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:18,798
Because I won the Nobel Prize...

311
00:29:18,898 --> 00:29:23,550
or because I inspire
his latent homoerotic wet dreams?

312
00:29:25,026 --> 00:29:27,006
I'm so sorry.

313
00:29:27,106 --> 00:29:31,015
You see, the genius part
of his brain is so big...

314
00:29:31,115 --> 00:29:34,580
that it's just swallowed up
the civilized part of his brain...

315
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:38,537
causing this monstrous
antisocial behavior.

316
00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:43,390
Take me to my captain.

317
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:45,492
He can tell me in person.

318
00:29:45,592 --> 00:29:48,364
Please take your seat, sir.

319
00:29:48,464 --> 00:29:52,215
The seat belt sign is illuminated.

320
00:29:53,921 --> 00:29:56,412
Congratulations on your award.

321
00:31:24,975 --> 00:31:28,057
Hey, buddy.

322
00:31:28,157 --> 00:31:31,329
I can't understand what you're saying.

323
00:31:31,429 --> 00:31:34,009
What?

324
00:31:35,452 --> 00:31:39,238
The phone's traceable to a house
about four miles from here.

325
00:31:39,338 --> 00:31:42,107
Damn I'm good.

326
00:31:47,197 --> 00:31:50,178
I hope you like oranges.
There's a tree out back.

327
00:31:50,278 --> 00:31:54,086
We got lots of oranges.

328
00:31:54,186 --> 00:31:55,588
Ooh.

329
00:31:55,688 --> 00:31:58,140
Nice try. Here.

330
00:32:00,344 --> 00:32:04,765
You got to...
You got to dive for it.

331
00:32:04,865 --> 00:32:06,839
Dive for it.

332
00:32:22,132 --> 00:32:25,484
Hello.
Dr. Eli Michaelson, please.

333
00:32:25,584 --> 00:32:27,718
Please help! Help me, somebody!
Help me, please!

334
00:32:27,818 --> 00:32:29,189
- Hey.
- Help me, please!

335
00:32:29,289 --> 00:32:31,434
Could you hold on a second?

336
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:35,143
Hey! Help me!
Somebody help me, please!

337
00:32:38,782 --> 00:32:41,201
Don't do that again.

338
00:32:41,301 --> 00:32:43,265
The press interview is at 4:00...

339
00:32:43,365 --> 00:32:46,137
and it's being held
at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.

340
00:32:46,237 --> 00:32:50,475
And then we're going
to a reception at the Swedish Academy...

341
00:32:50,575 --> 00:32:52,541
and then cocktails
at the Royal Swedish Academy.

342
00:32:52,641 --> 00:32:56,516
- And then we're expected for dinner...
- Fine. Fine. Drag us wherever.

343
00:32:56,616 --> 00:32:59,648
I just have one question.

344
00:32:59,748 --> 00:33:02,188
Who pays for the stuff
in the little fridge here?

345
00:33:02,288 --> 00:33:04,888
Me or the apologetic
inventor of dynamite?

346
00:33:08,624 --> 00:33:12,161
Eli Michaelson, Nobel laureate.

347
00:33:12,261 --> 00:33:15,433
Hello.
I have your son, Doctor.

348
00:33:15,533 --> 00:33:20,468
He will only survive
if I receive two million unmarked bills.

349
00:33:20,568 --> 00:33:25,517
Oh, bull. Cut the shit, Barkley,
and get your ass on a plane to Sweden.

350
00:33:27,598 --> 00:33:30,726
- I wanted to talk to him.
- Sorry.

351
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:37,036
Well, if we're going to be prompt,
we'd best get a move on.

352
00:33:41,511 --> 00:33:43,411
He hung up.

353
00:33:50,187 --> 00:33:51,869
I need your thumb.

354
00:33:51,969 --> 00:33:54,970
- What?
- We send him your thumb.

355
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,775
- He'll understand the magnitude of the situation.
- No.

356
00:33:57,875 --> 00:33:59,942
No. No.

357
00:34:00,042 --> 00:34:02,010
The thumb. No.

358
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:04,484
That's the opposable digit.

359
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:08,286
It's not just a finger.
It's what separates man from beast.

360
00:34:08,386 --> 00:34:10,419
No! No, please!

361
00:34:10,519 --> 00:34:13,257
Please. Look, I'm begging you.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

362
00:34:13,357 --> 00:34:16,628
Hey. No. Look, look, look.
Let me call him. Let me call him.

363
00:34:16,728 --> 00:34:18,693
He's my dad.
He'll listen to me.

364
00:34:18,793 --> 00:34:21,999
My dad's a bastard, but he'll listen to me.
Let me talk to my dad. Please.

365
00:34:22,099 --> 00:34:25,471
He's an asshole. He is.
But he'll listen. Please, let me call him.

366
00:34:25,571 --> 00:34:28,820
I'll let him know how serious this is,
how serious you are. I will.

367
00:34:38,101 --> 00:34:41,832
What is that?

368
00:34:51,462 --> 00:34:53,765
- Hello.
- Dad! Dad! Do not hang up.

369
00:34:53,865 --> 00:34:56,634
Oh, much better without
the voice modulator.

370
00:34:56,734 --> 00:34:59,105
No, that wasn't me.
That was...

371
00:34:59,205 --> 00:35:01,169
my kidnapper.

372
00:35:01,269 --> 00:35:04,211
Please, just listen to me, okay?

373
00:35:04,311 --> 00:35:07,146
I am being held hostage
by a very brutal man...

374
00:35:07,246 --> 00:35:09,744
who's going to cut off my thumb
and kill me...

375
00:35:09,844 --> 00:35:12,313
if you do not agree
to his terms, okay?

376
00:35:12,413 --> 00:35:15,383
Dad, I'm in trouble.

377
00:35:15,483 --> 00:35:17,452
Trouble? You bet.

378
00:35:17,552 --> 00:35:19,791
Do you realize
how much I'm gonna have to pay...

379
00:35:19,891 --> 00:35:22,660
to change what was supposed
to be a free ticket to Stockholm?

380
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,096
I'm scared.

381
00:35:24,196 --> 00:35:28,366
Stop fucking with me
and get your ass on a plane.

382
00:35:28,466 --> 00:35:29,836
A.S.A.P.

383
00:35:29,936 --> 00:35:32,670
What are you doing in church?

384
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:35,405
- Is Mom there? I wanna talk to Mom.
- What are you...

385
00:35:35,505 --> 00:35:38,256
Dad? Dad.

386
00:35:41,498 --> 00:35:43,478
Thumb time?

387
00:35:43,578 --> 00:35:46,115
- That was Barkley, wasn't it?
- He's on his way.

388
00:35:46,215 --> 00:35:49,420
- Hopefully, he'll make it in time.
- He's really on his way?

389
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,756
He sends his love to you, Sarah.

390
00:35:51,856 --> 00:35:54,003
What was he doing in church?

391
00:35:55,579 --> 00:35:58,262
What kind of father treats
his own flesh and blood like that?

392
00:35:58,362 --> 00:36:01,031
Oh, he's a bad one.
Now that he's got the Nobel Prize...

393
00:36:01,131 --> 00:36:04,200
- he's only gonna be worse.
- The Nobel Prize he does not deserve.

394
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:07,369
Oh, yeah. Yeah, I know. I'm sure there's
all kinds of more worthy candidates.

395
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:09,938
No! It was not
his technique. He stole it.

396
00:36:10,038 --> 00:36:14,678
He probably did.
You know, he is a scumbag.

397
00:36:14,778 --> 00:36:17,495
Who did he steal it from?

398
00:36:19,036 --> 00:36:21,584
- Harriman James.
- Who?

399
00:36:21,684 --> 00:36:24,970
Dear friend of your father's.
He's dead.

400
00:36:26,109 --> 00:36:30,260
Harriman James was my father.

401
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,764
Sorry.

402
00:36:31,864 --> 00:36:33,266
I am.

403
00:36:33,366 --> 00:36:36,067
- I know what a shit my father can be.
- You have no idea.

404
00:36:36,167 --> 00:36:38,246
You have no idea what a shit he is.

405
00:36:44,094 --> 00:36:46,108
Fuck.

406
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:51,065
Janet Polanyi, Cal-Sci undergrad.
September 2005.

407
00:36:52,702 --> 00:36:58,321
Rema Lahmani, professor of geobiology.
January 2006.

408
00:36:58,421 --> 00:37:02,626
Heather Phillips?
She's in administration.

409
00:37:02,726 --> 00:37:04,062
No.

410
00:37:04,162 --> 00:37:07,899
Beth Chapman.
That was taken three weeks ago.

411
00:37:07,999 --> 00:37:10,578
That man is a beast.

412
00:37:14,724 --> 00:37:16,906
That was my mother.

413
00:37:17,006 --> 00:37:21,144
She was married to Harriman James
at the time.

414
00:37:21,244 --> 00:37:24,516
He was a grad student
in chemistry at Harvard...

415
00:37:24,616 --> 00:37:28,285
who had a radical notion
that one could use laser excitation...

416
00:37:28,385 --> 00:37:31,290
with wide-field microscopy...

417
00:37:31,390 --> 00:37:34,957
in order to observe fluorescence emission
in a single molecule.

418
00:37:37,226 --> 00:37:40,966
This is Harriman's lab book,
September '72.

419
00:37:41,066 --> 00:37:45,534
Pages nine through 16.

420
00:37:45,634 --> 00:37:48,440
The genesis of single-molecule
spectroscopy?

421
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,606
Yeah.

422
00:37:50,706 --> 00:37:54,710
Harriman James and Eli Michaelson
were best friends.

423
00:37:54,810 --> 00:38:00,282
So my father and your mother,
they had an affair?

424
00:38:00,382 --> 00:38:03,790
When my mother got pregnant...

425
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,865
Harriman James killed himself.

426
00:38:07,244 --> 00:38:11,293
See, he knew he was sterile.

427
00:38:11,393 --> 00:38:14,666
- Does my father know this?
- Of course he knows it.

428
00:38:14,766 --> 00:38:18,137
- Do you know him? Have you met him?
- No.

429
00:38:18,237 --> 00:38:20,701
Wait. So you're my...
brother.

430
00:38:20,801 --> 00:38:23,372
Half brother.

431
00:38:23,472 --> 00:38:25,912
What's your name?

432
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:28,178
Thaddeus...

433
00:38:28,278 --> 00:38:30,245
James.

434
00:38:30,345 --> 00:38:34,417
Look, I understand where
you're coming from, Thaddeus...

435
00:38:34,517 --> 00:38:38,689
and I even think that you're,
I mean, somewhat justified.

436
00:38:38,789 --> 00:38:40,693
Taking his Nobel Prize money.

437
00:38:40,793 --> 00:38:42,858
That seems like
the appropriate way...

438
00:38:42,958 --> 00:38:48,334
to avenge the memory of your fath...
Thad... uh, Harriman. Harriman James.

439
00:38:48,434 --> 00:38:54,273
You know what? Better yet, let the world
know who rightfully deserves the credit.

440
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:56,939
- Right?
- Yeah. Yeah.

441
00:38:57,039 --> 00:39:00,475
All in good time, Barkley.

442
00:39:00,575 --> 00:39:03,916
- But now I'm gonna need your thumb.
- Thaddeus, we're brothers.

443
00:39:04,016 --> 00:39:06,683
- No. We're half brothers.
- Please, no, hey!

444
00:39:06,783 --> 00:39:09,385
I wanna work with you on this.
I am on your side.

445
00:39:09,485 --> 00:39:13,602
Together. Partners.
Don't. Don't. Don't take my thumb!

446
00:39:57,887 --> 00:39:59,878
God.

447
00:40:03,740 --> 00:40:08,845
I bet the king farts
in the privacy of his own limo.

448
00:40:08,945 --> 00:40:12,250
And a lot of other places
if he eats like that every night.

449
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:14,315
I bet he has a manservant...

450
00:40:14,415 --> 00:40:18,272
whose sole responsibility
is to take the blame for the king's farts.

451
00:40:27,517 --> 00:40:29,132
What's this?

452
00:40:29,232 --> 00:40:33,769
That came for Mrs. Michaelson
this afternoon, Doctor.

453
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:38,244
Really? I'm not expecting anything.

454
00:40:38,344 --> 00:40:41,786
Well, open it.
The Unabomber is in jail.

455
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:46,058
You open it.

456
00:41:24,741 --> 00:41:26,732
Hello.

457
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,769
Oh, my God.

458
00:41:38,254 --> 00:41:40,706
Oh, yes.
This is subtle.

459
00:41:40,806 --> 00:41:43,805
I talked to Johannson in Stockholm.

460
00:41:43,905 --> 00:41:47,043
They're not gonna release the thumb
until they've run their own tests.

461
00:41:47,143 --> 00:41:49,644
- How long will that be?
- I don't know.

462
00:41:49,744 --> 00:41:51,780
You might wanna find
a new hiding place.

463
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,185
Under the flowerpot's too easy.

464
00:41:54,285 --> 00:41:56,953
- We've hid it there for 20 years.
- Okay.

465
00:41:57,053 --> 00:42:00,021
So you've been lucky
for 20 years, Eli...

466
00:42:00,121 --> 00:42:02,090
and your luck just ran out.

467
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:06,627
It was 10:15 when I went.
I was already late.

468
00:42:06,727 --> 00:42:12,537
I have to leave the house
at 10:09 to get to work.

469
00:42:12,637 --> 00:42:16,941
I waited.
I waited until 10:15.

470
00:42:17,041 --> 00:42:20,655
I usually leave at 10:09.

471
00:42:24,367 --> 00:42:26,583
I thought they said no cops.

472
00:42:26,683 --> 00:42:29,453
- Sir, do you have call waiting?
- No!

473
00:42:29,553 --> 00:42:31,755
Just a question.

474
00:42:31,855 --> 00:42:33,388
- Detective.
- Relyea.

475
00:42:33,488 --> 00:42:36,558
We checked every operating church
in San Gabriel Valley and came up empty.

476
00:42:36,658 --> 00:42:39,160
- Sorry, ma'am.
- Bill, we gotta go through these leads.

477
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:42,101
I've been over
and over this in my head.

478
00:42:42,201 --> 00:42:46,403
I'm sure that's what he said. He was going
to Equator Books to meet a girl.

479
00:42:46,503 --> 00:42:50,241
Her name is...
Capitol Hill or something.

480
00:42:50,341 --> 00:42:52,306
Let's try the Equator Books thing.

481
00:42:52,406 --> 00:42:56,681
I didn't hear the bicycle.
I didn't hear him come in.

482
00:42:56,781 --> 00:42:59,997
I listened, Sarah.
I listened.

483
00:43:41,311 --> 00:43:45,130
Let me make you something to eat.
You haven't eaten all day.

484
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:49,332
Max, I'm not hungry.

485
00:43:49,432 --> 00:43:55,173
The smell of Max Mariner's world-famous
scrambled eggs and burnt toast...

486
00:43:55,273 --> 00:43:57,556
will make you hungry.

487
00:43:58,928 --> 00:44:01,043
Does it have to be burnt?

488
00:44:01,143 --> 00:44:03,598
For you, I'll make an exception.

489
00:44:07,704 --> 00:44:10,089
- You're a good guy, Max.
- No.

490
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:14,189
Not to everyone.
But I'm crazy about you.

491
00:44:16,925 --> 00:44:19,541
Sorry.

492
00:44:25,755 --> 00:44:28,207
But I would be worried.

493
00:44:28,307 --> 00:44:31,441
The thumb and, you know,
the violence of the act.

494
00:44:31,541 --> 00:44:36,247
But it's a real possibility
that it's not Barkley's thumb at all.

495
00:44:36,347 --> 00:44:41,383
There were four thumb-related
crimes in the L.A. area...

496
00:44:41,483 --> 00:44:43,856
in the last three weeks.

497
00:44:43,956 --> 00:44:45,689
Huh.

498
00:44:45,789 --> 00:44:49,108
I hope it is his thumb.

499
00:44:52,582 --> 00:44:56,097
If it's somebody else's thumb...

500
00:44:56,197 --> 00:45:01,350
then this kidnapper is
a calculating psychopath.

501
00:45:02,592 --> 00:45:05,220
He's thinking it through
step by step.

502
00:45:06,930 --> 00:45:10,946
And he doesn't wanna deal
with a suffering, hysterical captive.

503
00:45:11,046 --> 00:45:15,117
So he very rationally went out...

504
00:45:15,217 --> 00:45:17,887
and amputated someone's thumb...

505
00:45:17,987 --> 00:45:20,522
some random victim.

506
00:45:20,622 --> 00:45:23,378
Made his life a whole lot easier.

507
00:45:23,511 --> 00:45:25,761
On the other hand...

508
00:45:25,861 --> 00:45:28,441
if it is Barkley's thumb...

509
00:45:30,685 --> 00:45:32,676
then they're sloppy.

510
00:45:34,589 --> 00:45:36,569
And they are holed up somewhere...

511
00:45:36,669 --> 00:45:42,276
with my very bloody, hysterical son.

512
00:45:42,376 --> 00:45:46,115
And his anguish...

513
00:45:46,215 --> 00:45:50,385
and his...
profuse bleeding...

514
00:45:50,485 --> 00:45:52,822
are making them crazy...

515
00:45:52,922 --> 00:45:55,556
and they are gonna be
a whole lot easier...

516
00:45:55,656 --> 00:45:59,306
to find or thwart or...

517
00:46:01,516 --> 00:46:03,507
or something.

518
00:46:05,186 --> 00:46:09,486
And Barkley will
never be good at golf.

519
00:46:11,959 --> 00:46:13,950
Requires thumbs.

520
00:46:16,364 --> 00:46:22,185
I lay there in a bath
of my own excrement...

521
00:46:22,285 --> 00:46:24,351
inhaling the pungent aroma...

522
00:46:24,451 --> 00:46:27,223
the smell of life's bottom line.

523
00:46:29,523 --> 00:46:32,592
The morning light bled
through the angry slats.

524
00:46:32,692 --> 00:46:34,829
I feel like I need a shower.

525
00:46:34,929 --> 00:46:36,896
Powerful, isn't it?

526
00:46:36,996 --> 00:46:39,302
Capitol Hill.

527
00:46:39,402 --> 00:46:41,805
Does that name ring a bell?

528
00:46:41,905 --> 00:46:44,370
There's a City Hall who sometimes reads.

529
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:48,008
- Provides to the craven and needy.
- Do you recognize this guy?

530
00:46:48,108 --> 00:46:50,514
Oh, yes.
That's Barkley Michaelson.

531
00:46:50,614 --> 00:46:52,578
That's his table.

532
00:46:52,678 --> 00:46:54,647
He sits there day after day...

533
00:46:54,747 --> 00:46:58,521
playing with his, uh, Gameboy
and daydreaming about cannibals.

534
00:46:58,621 --> 00:47:01,222
- Cannibals?
- Yes. His thesis.

535
00:47:01,322 --> 00:47:03,289
Strange chap, you know.

536
00:47:03,389 --> 00:47:07,860
I tell him that his father has won the Nobel
Prize, and do you know what he says?

537
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:11,897
"That lucky fucking son of a bitch."
Can you believe that?

538
00:47:11,997 --> 00:47:14,838
Yeah. Well, you'd believe that
if you ever met his father.

539
00:47:14,938 --> 00:47:17,808
Anything else?

540
00:47:17,908 --> 00:47:20,344
Um, there's a bike, yes.

541
00:47:20,444 --> 00:47:23,212
It's been out there for days now.
I think it's his.

542
00:47:23,312 --> 00:47:26,216
- Thank you.
- Me?

543
00:47:26,316 --> 00:47:28,325
Excuse me.

544
00:47:31,072 --> 00:47:34,520
Hello. My name is Clifford...

545
00:47:34,620 --> 00:47:39,058
any my poem today is called
"Death by Drano."

546
00:47:39,158 --> 00:47:42,547
Byron was four
when he took his first sip.

547
00:47:48,322 --> 00:47:52,074
- There's maybe, like, 75 ahead of you.
- Decaf, nonfat...

548
00:47:52,174 --> 00:47:54,578
no foam, extra hot latte...

549
00:47:54,678 --> 00:47:57,324
and a box of Krispy Kremes.

550
00:47:58,833 --> 00:48:03,270
- Do I look cheap to you?
- Cheap? I spent 8.83 on that.

551
00:48:05,606 --> 00:48:07,620
All right.
What do you need?

552
00:48:07,720 --> 00:48:11,561
She goes by City Hall.
It's got to be an alias or something.

553
00:48:11,661 --> 00:48:13,511
You think?

554
00:48:54,055 --> 00:48:56,136
Merry fucking Christmas.

555
00:48:56,236 --> 00:48:58,642
I got something under the tree
for you, asshole.

556
00:48:58,742 --> 00:49:01,043
Santa's got a raging hard-on
for you, baby.

557
00:49:01,143 --> 00:49:04,346
Why don't you take
my Yule log up your chimney?

558
00:49:04,446 --> 00:49:08,352
Suck my North Pole, baby. You looking
at me, asshole? Merry Christmas.

559
00:49:08,452 --> 00:49:12,052
Fuck off, asswipe.
Come on and sit on Santa's lap.

560
00:49:12,152 --> 00:49:14,890
Naughty little girls make
my St. Nick stand at attention.

561
00:49:14,990 --> 00:49:17,192
Ho! Ho! Ho!
Hey, you bald motherfucker.

562
00:49:17,292 --> 00:49:19,894
What are you looking at,
shithead? Shithead. Shithead.

563
00:49:19,994 --> 00:49:22,313
Shithead.
Shithead. Shithead.

564
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:31,338
Let's do a two-way. This Claus
likes it nasty. Suck my reindeer dick.

565
00:49:31,438 --> 00:49:34,643
Bend over and let me
fill your sock with my stuffing.

566
00:49:34,743 --> 00:49:37,357
Have a great holiday season.

567
00:50:05,860 --> 00:50:07,609
Hello.

568
00:50:07,709 --> 00:50:10,513
- Hi, Sarah.
- Oh, hi, Meg.

569
00:50:10,613 --> 00:50:14,898
I can't talk right now.

570
00:50:33,521 --> 00:50:36,069
- Hello.
- Listen to me carefully.

571
00:50:36,169 --> 00:50:38,137
I'm only gonna say it once.

572
00:50:38,237 --> 00:50:40,942
You are to put two million
in unmarked, untraceable bills...

573
00:50:41,042 --> 00:50:43,109
in the trunk
of the red Mini Cooper...

574
00:50:43,209 --> 00:50:46,381
in the atrium of the Puente Hills mall
on Sunday morning...

575
00:50:46,481 --> 00:50:48,981
at precisely 9:00 a.m.

576
00:50:49,081 --> 00:50:51,354
You are then to go straight home
and wait for instructions...

577
00:50:51,454 --> 00:50:53,824
on where to collect
your whining, miserable son.

578
00:50:53,924 --> 00:50:57,924
I see any cops,
the deal's off and Barkley's dead.

579
00:50:58,024 --> 00:51:00,329
- I need to talk to him before I deal with you.
- He's fine.

580
00:51:00,429 --> 00:51:02,746
I wanna talk to him.
I wanna talk to my son.

581
00:51:12,093 --> 00:51:14,073
- Mom?
- Barkley!

582
00:51:14,173 --> 00:51:16,356
Get me out of this.
Get me out of here, Mom.

583
00:51:17,732 --> 00:51:19,650
Got it.

584
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,361
We're going to.
Barkley!

585
00:51:26,306 --> 00:51:29,605
I sent your parents
a severed human thumb.

586
00:51:31,377 --> 00:51:33,627
You sent my parents a thumb?

587
00:51:33,727 --> 00:51:38,033
Well, did you really think
we'd get their undivided attention...

588
00:51:38,133 --> 00:51:41,436
with just a picture of you
holding a newspaper?

589
00:51:41,536 --> 00:51:42,871
Whose thumb?

590
00:51:42,971 --> 00:51:46,038
Look, if I had actually
cut off your thumb...

591
00:51:46,138 --> 00:51:48,207
you would've been bloody.

592
00:51:48,307 --> 00:51:51,024
You would've been hysterical and
completely useless to me as a partner.

593
00:51:52,899 --> 00:51:57,652
It's okay to eat the dead
but not to amputate a finger?

594
00:51:57,752 --> 00:52:00,797
Confusing set of rules
you live by, Barkley.

595
00:52:02,609 --> 00:52:05,510
- I'm going to hell for this.
- "Hell is for Children."

596
00:52:06,646 --> 00:52:09,114
- What?
- Pat Benatar.

597
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:14,679
If they let us trace them,
then they're sloppy. Let's go, guys.

598
00:52:16,289 --> 00:52:20,507
- What exactly does that mean?
- Barkley lost his thumb.

599
00:52:20,607 --> 00:52:22,545
I thought we already knew that.

600
00:52:22,645 --> 00:52:27,916
So here's how it's gonna go. While
your father is pacing in his living room...

601
00:52:28,016 --> 00:52:30,481
wondering iflife
is better without you...

602
00:52:30,581 --> 00:52:33,334
Pasadena's finest will
storm the wrong house.

603
00:52:34,941 --> 00:52:37,056
All right. Stay down!

604
00:52:37,156 --> 00:52:40,563
We've, uh, made a mistake.

605
00:52:40,663 --> 00:52:42,842
Meanwhile, at the mall...

606
00:52:44,384 --> 00:52:45,863
Goddamn it.

607
00:52:45,963 --> 00:52:50,082
I told them, no merchandise deliveries
until we finish the framing.

608
00:52:51,257 --> 00:52:53,271
What am I gonna do
with all this shit?

609
00:52:53,371 --> 00:52:55,244
Construction crew
is just looking forward...

610
00:52:55,344 --> 00:52:57,612
to a few Saturday night
brews with the boys...

611
00:52:57,712 --> 00:52:59,913
and Sunday off with the kids.

612
00:53:00,013 --> 00:53:02,194
No, no, no.
I got this, fellas.

613
00:53:06,105 --> 00:53:11,190
The Mini was lowered
into the Atrium by helicopter.

614
00:53:11,290 --> 00:53:15,197
...while the police devise an offensive
so as not to be humiliated.

615
00:53:15,297 --> 00:53:18,296
From where it sits,
there's no driving it out of there.

616
00:53:18,396 --> 00:53:22,218
There's no access and no doorway
that's wide enough to drive through.

617
00:53:24,023 --> 00:53:29,243
At exactly 7:45 a.m., the southwest doors
will open for employees only.

618
00:53:29,343 --> 00:53:32,810
That leaves me with approximately
one hour to rebuild the car.

619
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:34,581
No. I got nothing.

620
00:53:34,681 --> 00:53:39,161
Under no circumstances do we reveal
ourselves as officers of the law.

621
00:53:42,375 --> 00:53:47,438
Barkley Michaelson's life depends
upon our precision and restraint.

622
00:54:34,894 --> 00:54:36,942
What's he doing?

623
00:54:37,042 --> 00:54:39,314
The fuck if I know.

624
00:54:39,414 --> 00:54:41,458
Hey! No! Go get her.

625
00:54:50,143 --> 00:54:52,258
- I'm delivering it.
- Wai...

626
00:54:52,358 --> 00:54:54,336
Wait a minute, Sarah.

627
00:54:56,749 --> 00:54:59,100
Do you really feel comfortable
carrying it across a mall...

628
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:03,403
and leaving it in the trunk of a car that
thousands of people are tossing raffle tickets into?

629
00:55:03,503 --> 00:55:05,739
It's everything we have, Sarah.

630
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:09,577
It is not everything we have.
We have our son...

631
00:55:09,677 --> 00:55:12,981
who we love more than
any amount of money in the world.

632
00:55:13,081 --> 00:55:15,383
- There are no alternatives, Eli.
- Sarah...

633
00:55:15,483 --> 00:55:18,084
Damn it.

634
00:55:18,184 --> 00:55:20,455
I'll tell you.

635
00:55:20,555 --> 00:55:22,520
It's lonely at the top.

636
00:55:22,620 --> 00:55:23,870
Sir?

637
00:55:25,912 --> 00:55:28,263
You're lucky you're not a genius.

638
00:55:28,363 --> 00:55:31,734
If we get your son back alive,
Dr. Michaelson, we're all geniuses.

639
00:55:31,834 --> 00:55:34,169
At exactly 9:00 a.m...

640
00:55:34,269 --> 00:55:37,937
you will join the other 200
screaming families as they enter...

641
00:55:38,037 --> 00:55:42,859
and try to be the first 100
to receive their free MP3s.

642
00:56:53,766 --> 00:56:57,759
Once the drop is made,
let the fun begin.

643
00:57:27,633 --> 00:57:30,018
How could that be?

644
00:57:30,118 --> 00:57:32,367
Sir, it's driving away.

645
00:57:40,947 --> 00:57:43,028
It's a trap.
What are they do...

646
00:57:58,811 --> 00:58:01,926
I think it's going
to the northwest entrance.

647
00:58:16,115 --> 00:58:18,567
We got him.
There's no way out.

648
00:58:18,667 --> 00:58:21,279
Who is "he" if nobody's
driving the car?

649
00:58:43,042 --> 00:58:45,759
Slow down! No!

650
01:00:25,511 --> 01:00:27,502
I fixed the fluorescents.

651
01:00:28,981 --> 01:00:31,745
They were flickering.

652
01:00:57,576 --> 01:01:00,827
Back, back, back, back, back. Okay.

653
01:01:00,927 --> 01:01:02,904
We got him.

654
01:01:07,753 --> 01:01:10,415
Sir, you're gonna wanna see this.

655
01:01:58,003 --> 01:02:00,220
It's all there.

656
01:02:00,320 --> 01:02:05,323
One million dollars apiece.

657
01:02:05,423 --> 01:02:08,763
Holy shit, that's a lot
of fuckin' money!

658
01:02:08,863 --> 01:02:11,665
This is definitely one of the high points
of my entire life. Really.

659
01:02:11,765 --> 01:02:15,434
I mean, this ranks higher
than my first blow job by Eileen Salzer.

660
01:02:15,534 --> 01:02:17,737
She was the redheaded tuba player
in the 10th grade band.

661
01:02:17,837 --> 01:02:20,506
Higher than my first car.

662
01:02:20,606 --> 01:02:23,675
Higher than my second blow job. But that
doesn't really count, 'cause my mom walked in...

663
01:02:23,775 --> 01:02:27,278
Does it rank higher than your wedding
to the blue-eyed Russian studies major...

664
01:02:27,378 --> 01:02:29,818
Meredith Ma-a-a-s?

665
01:02:29,918 --> 01:02:33,187
- How the fuck did you know about Meredith?
- I just know.

666
01:02:33,287 --> 01:02:35,786
- What the fuck do you know?
- I know...

667
01:02:35,886 --> 01:02:39,193
that you couldn't get it up,
so basically she went shopping elsewhere.

668
01:02:39,293 --> 01:02:41,473
That covers it, right?

669
01:02:43,515 --> 01:02:47,575
Huh?

670
01:02:49,221 --> 01:02:51,938
- Brothers shouldn't have secrets, Barkley.
- Fuck you!

671
01:02:52,038 --> 01:02:53,942
God!

672
01:02:54,042 --> 01:02:56,208
"Fuck you. Fuck you."

673
01:02:56,308 --> 01:02:58,213
I'm taking my money,
and I'm going home.

674
01:02:58,313 --> 01:03:01,183
Oh, you go home.

675
01:03:01,283 --> 01:03:03,531
I'll kill you first.

676
01:03:08,440 --> 01:03:10,988
Oh, you'd kill me?

677
01:03:11,088 --> 01:03:13,495
But you wouldn't eat me.

678
01:03:13,595 --> 01:03:15,206
Would ya?

679
01:03:32,731 --> 01:03:36,348
- Where'd you get the car?
- Same place I got the last one.

680
01:03:36,448 --> 01:03:39,720
Church. Sunday Mass,
everyone's busy praying.

681
01:03:39,820 --> 01:03:42,589
- You stole it?
- You make it sound like it's a crime.

682
01:03:42,689 --> 01:03:44,836
Come on.

683
01:03:59,358 --> 01:04:01,622
Howdy.

684
01:04:09,535 --> 01:04:11,526
So...

685
01:04:12,771 --> 01:04:14,751
- Swallow it.
- What?

686
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:17,489
When they pick you up,
they're gonna search every inch of you.

687
01:04:17,589 --> 01:04:20,443
Just swallow it
and wait for it to poop itself out.

688
01:04:21,947 --> 01:04:24,197
Fuck you.

689
01:04:24,297 --> 01:04:26,735
Either you swallow it
and go on stool patrol...

690
01:04:26,835 --> 01:04:28,900
or I'm gonna shove it
up your ass for you.

691
01:04:29,000 --> 01:04:30,978
Your choice.

692
01:04:46,905 --> 01:04:48,823
You spend a dime of that money...

693
01:04:48,923 --> 01:04:51,556
they'll track you down faster
than you can digest milk.

694
01:04:51,656 --> 01:04:56,342
I don't think we should talk to each other
again for at least two years... if ever.

695
01:04:57,483 --> 01:04:59,834
Can't say I'll miss you.

696
01:04:59,934 --> 01:05:01,836
It's been interesting
having a brother.

697
01:05:01,936 --> 01:05:04,772
I never needed a brother.
I needed a father.

698
01:05:04,872 --> 01:05:07,641
Trust me.
You're better off without Eli.

699
01:05:07,741 --> 01:05:10,977
My mother hated me
because I reminded her of him.

700
01:05:11,077 --> 01:05:13,122
Okay. Well...

701
01:05:14,066 --> 01:05:15,761
Yeah.

702
01:05:17,703 --> 01:05:19,796
What the...

703
01:05:40,159 --> 01:05:42,627
You don't want 'em to think
you faked the kidnapping, do ya?

704
01:05:48,934 --> 01:05:50,902
Whoa.

705
01:05:54,373 --> 01:05:58,293
I'm Kelly Lange, and I'm standing in front
of the home of Dr. Eli Michaelson...

706
01:05:58,393 --> 01:06:01,425
who was just awarded
the Nobel Prize in chemistry.

707
01:06:01,525 --> 01:06:05,163
Now, it has been a week
of highs and lows for the Nobel laureate...

708
01:06:05,263 --> 01:06:09,036
who had to cut short his celebrations
with the king and queen of Sweden...

709
01:06:09,136 --> 01:06:12,203
to come back here and face
the iniquitous kidnapping of his only son.

710
01:06:12,303 --> 01:06:15,339
First you lose my money,
which is supposed to lead us to Barkley...

711
01:06:15,439 --> 01:06:18,408
then there's no word from Barkley,
who might very well be dead...

712
01:06:18,508 --> 01:06:21,478
and now I can't even leave the house
because there's a media zoo outside.

713
01:06:21,578 --> 01:06:23,181
Who informed them?

714
01:06:23,281 --> 01:06:26,052
Hello?

715
01:06:26,152 --> 01:06:28,265
This is Kelly Lange from KLPK.

716
01:06:29,641 --> 01:06:32,189
Ms. Lange,
are you standing in front of my house?

717
01:06:32,289 --> 01:06:34,507
I am indeed.

718
01:06:36,114 --> 01:06:38,032
Sarah, put the gun down.

719
01:06:38,132 --> 01:06:40,467
I think I have Mrs. Michaelson
on the line now.

720
01:06:40,567 --> 01:06:43,837
She's the mother of the boy who was
kidnapped, and we're told that she was very...

721
01:06:43,937 --> 01:06:45,840
- Ms. Lange.
- Yes?

722
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:48,405
I have a handgun
pointed at your head.

723
01:06:48,505 --> 01:06:50,344
If you don't get the fuck...

724
01:06:50,444 --> 01:06:53,179
off my lawn right now,
I'm gonna use it.

725
01:06:53,279 --> 01:06:55,358
Look! She's got a gun!

726
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:03,472
If we had call waiting,
it would be another story.

727
01:07:07,813 --> 01:07:10,395
Hello?

728
01:07:37,809 --> 01:07:41,493
Your mother and I would very much
like you to go to the hospital.

729
01:07:41,593 --> 01:07:45,562
- We'd just like to make sure nothing's broken.
- No. I want to go home.

730
01:07:45,662 --> 01:07:48,570
Okay. Okay. We're going home.

731
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:51,623
Oh, God. I'm so happy
to have you back.

732
01:07:53,292 --> 01:07:55,351
I'm happy to see you too, Mom.

733
01:07:58,830 --> 01:08:00,810
Why does he have both thumbs?

734
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:05,585
Eli, would you have felt better
about the two million dollars if he lost one?

735
01:08:05,685 --> 01:08:07,651
Lose the edge, Sarah,
and explain to me...

736
01:08:07,751 --> 01:08:11,823
whose thumb was sent to us in Stockholm
if Barkley has both of his.

737
01:08:11,923 --> 01:08:13,958
They threatened to cut off my thumb.

738
01:08:14,058 --> 01:08:16,397
How many of them were there?

739
01:08:16,497 --> 01:08:18,433
Two.

740
01:08:18,533 --> 01:08:21,369
Can you describe 'em?

741
01:08:21,469 --> 01:08:25,373
They had this thing over my head.

742
01:08:25,473 --> 01:08:29,141
Burlap sack.
It was dark.

743
01:08:29,241 --> 01:08:33,378
I was thirsty, and they gave me water.
I couldn't even swallow it.

744
01:08:33,478 --> 01:08:37,902
So, tell me, Barkley.
What was City Hall's role in all this?

745
01:08:38,937 --> 01:08:40,855
City?

746
01:08:40,955 --> 01:08:44,623
She didn't have anything to do with it.
She probably hates me right now.

747
01:08:44,723 --> 01:08:46,662
Can we just do this tomorrow, Max?

748
01:08:46,762 --> 01:08:50,829
We're never gonna catch these guys anyway.
I'm sure they're long gone by now.

749
01:08:50,929 --> 01:08:52,834
Gone where?

750
01:08:52,934 --> 01:08:56,804
How would I know? It's not like they discussed
their travel plans with me. Look at me.

751
01:08:56,904 --> 01:08:59,504
See?

752
01:08:59,604 --> 01:09:01,639
Oh, I hadn't...

753
01:09:01,739 --> 01:09:03,645
So, tell me.

754
01:09:03,745 --> 01:09:07,176
Do you even know City's real name?

755
01:09:07,276 --> 01:09:09,616
Yeah. Sharon Hall.

756
01:09:09,716 --> 01:09:12,215
Please, don't involve her, Max.

757
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:14,222
She's really sensitive.

758
01:09:14,322 --> 01:09:17,124
And she's furious with me.
I promised I'd call her, and I didn't...

759
01:09:17,224 --> 01:09:19,526
'cause I fucking got kidnapped.

760
01:09:19,626 --> 01:09:24,161
- Please, will you promise me?
- You were kidnapped outside City's house, right?

761
01:09:24,261 --> 01:09:25,998
No. Here.

762
01:09:26,098 --> 01:09:27,449
Here?

763
01:09:29,154 --> 01:09:31,938
Bill, we gotta bring in
the forensics crew right now.

764
01:09:32,038 --> 01:09:34,538
- Here? Why?
- We messed up.

765
01:09:34,638 --> 01:09:37,512
Uh, Barkley was abducted
from this house...

766
01:09:37,612 --> 01:09:39,514
probably right after
you took off for...

767
01:09:39,614 --> 01:09:42,050
The kidnapper was in this house?

768
01:09:42,150 --> 01:09:45,886
Don't tell me that key's back
under the flowerpot.

769
01:09:45,986 --> 01:09:47,951
This is Sergeant Canepa.
Get me Forensics.

770
01:09:48,051 --> 01:09:51,055
- 9.99.
- Viagra changed my life.

771
01:09:51,155 --> 01:09:55,963
I work neighborhood patrol
for Westec in the San Gabriel Valley.

772
01:09:56,063 --> 01:09:59,299
And I needed some cash...

773
01:09:59,399 --> 01:10:02,101
to get a burger from Tommy's...
it's open all night.

774
01:10:02,201 --> 01:10:05,269
Tell our audience.

775
01:10:05,369 --> 01:10:07,371
Tell our audience
what happened next.

776
01:10:07,471 --> 01:10:09,877
I was at the A.T.M.
on Colorado and Lake...

777
01:10:09,977 --> 01:10:15,479
when I was attacked by a man
in a paper bag mask with a butcher knife...

778
01:10:15,579 --> 01:10:18,115
who took all my money.

779
01:10:18,215 --> 01:10:20,250
And my thumb.

780
01:10:20,350 --> 01:10:22,966
What kind of... Paper bag mask?

781
01:10:25,043 --> 01:10:26,977
A grocery bag with these...

782
01:10:28,313 --> 01:10:31,761
stars for eyes and, uh...

783
01:10:31,861 --> 01:10:34,330
like, big carpet eyebrows...

784
01:10:34,430 --> 01:10:38,412
and this big, bulbous red nose.

785
01:10:43,895 --> 01:10:45,813
Barkley.

786
01:10:45,913 --> 01:10:47,579
The kind you'd make in summer camp.

787
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:50,416
Barkley? Honey,
is everything all right?

788
01:10:50,516 --> 01:10:53,198
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I'm fine.

789
01:10:55,907 --> 01:10:58,793
How is Barkley?

790
01:10:58,893 --> 01:11:01,594
Honestly, he looks like shit.

791
01:11:03,698 --> 01:11:06,601
Well, if there's anything Pam and I can do,
don't hesitate.

792
01:11:06,701 --> 01:11:09,801
My son Ethan, who's at Oxford now
teaching linguistics...

793
01:11:09,901 --> 01:11:11,868
read about it in the London Times.

794
01:11:11,968 --> 01:11:13,875
He's terribly upset
for Barkley.

795
01:11:13,975 --> 01:11:17,474
Remember how they used to play
together when they were little boys?

796
01:11:17,574 --> 01:11:22,984
And remember when they were hauled in for
riding their bikes in the Thompson Koi Pond?

797
01:11:23,084 --> 01:11:27,551
Slow Ethan's teaching
linguistics at Oxford?

798
01:11:27,651 --> 01:11:30,525
Dr. Michaelson, I'm so sorry.

799
01:11:30,625 --> 01:11:32,133
Thank you.

800
01:11:37,082 --> 01:11:40,563
- Look at that.
- Come on, come on, come on.

801
01:11:40,663 --> 01:11:43,246
Sharks and vermin.

802
01:11:45,290 --> 01:11:47,838
- These are nice.
- I was so cruel.

803
01:11:47,938 --> 01:11:50,827
I left those savage
messages on his machine.

804
01:11:51,830 --> 01:11:53,821
I was so hurt when he didn't call.

805
01:11:55,267 --> 01:11:57,916
He promised to call.

806
01:11:58,016 --> 01:12:01,822
And then when he didn't call,
I wanted to hurt him because...

807
01:12:01,922 --> 01:12:03,738
I was so hurt.

808
01:12:04,910 --> 01:12:07,458
He would have called.

809
01:12:07,558 --> 01:12:09,526
Don't you think, Detective?

810
01:12:09,626 --> 01:12:12,095
Uh, yeah.

811
01:12:12,195 --> 01:12:13,568
Yeah, probably.

812
01:12:13,668 --> 01:12:16,485
- He liked me, didn't he?
- Oh, yeah.

813
01:12:18,123 --> 01:12:20,114
He liked my mind.

814
01:12:21,993 --> 01:12:23,927
My art.

815
01:12:25,864 --> 01:12:28,765
Oh, my God.
He liked my breasts.

816
01:12:32,953 --> 01:12:38,725
Uh, did you and Barkley plan to have
a date on the night of December 8?

817
01:12:38,825 --> 01:12:42,528
No. His bike was stolen from the Equator
and he needed a ride home.

818
01:12:42,628 --> 01:12:45,263
Stolen, huh?

819
01:12:45,363 --> 01:12:48,945
- And did you take him home?
- No.

820
01:12:50,355 --> 01:12:53,620
It was like we kissed...

821
01:12:55,460 --> 01:12:58,779
and suddenly we were consumed...

822
01:12:58,879 --> 01:13:01,648
by this raging...

823
01:13:01,748 --> 01:13:03,882
fire of passion...

824
01:13:03,982 --> 01:13:05,983
that just obliterated...

825
01:13:06,083 --> 01:13:08,388
the entire world around us and...

826
01:13:08,488 --> 01:13:11,488
the hunger and...

827
01:13:11,588 --> 01:13:14,827
thirst and desire
that we felt for each other.

828
01:13:14,927 --> 01:13:17,596
Right. Right.
And then afterwards...

829
01:13:17,696 --> 01:13:22,165
It was in the morning then
that you brought him home.

830
01:13:22,265 --> 01:13:24,138
That's the weird thing.

831
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:27,157
- What?
- He took a cab.

832
01:13:29,995 --> 01:13:31,929
Why is that weird?

833
01:13:33,498 --> 01:13:37,400
If he had no money at all
the night before...

834
01:13:39,204 --> 01:13:41,420
where'd he get the money
for the cab?

835
01:13:45,243 --> 01:13:47,695
I'm really sorry to bother you, Miss Hall.

836
01:13:47,795 --> 01:13:50,164
Thank you very much
for taking the time.

837
01:14:00,525 --> 01:14:02,674
City Hall original.

838
01:14:02,774 --> 01:14:04,977
Do you think she had something to do
with the kidnapping?

839
01:14:05,077 --> 01:14:07,015
It's pretty psychotic.

840
01:14:07,115 --> 01:14:09,213
But I'll tell ya.
It's not nearly as fucked-up...

841
01:14:09,313 --> 01:14:12,653
as the shit I saw at the poetry
reading at Equator Books.

842
01:14:12,753 --> 01:14:15,718
"Rats live on no evil star."

843
01:14:15,818 --> 01:14:18,192
That's Anne Sexton's epitaph.

844
01:14:18,292 --> 01:14:22,042
It's a palindrome.

845
01:14:23,415 --> 01:14:25,679
It is indeed.

846
01:14:36,910 --> 01:14:38,875
I'll have the chicken salad.

847
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,180
It's on the house today,
Dr. Michaelson.

848
01:14:41,280 --> 01:14:43,848
After all you've been through,
it's the least we could do.

849
01:14:43,948 --> 01:14:46,597
Then I'll have the T-bone, rare.
Thank you.

850
01:14:48,139 --> 01:14:50,856
- He's coming to sit with us.
- Slide that chair away.

851
01:14:50,956 --> 01:14:53,361
Give him a break, will ya?
Guy's been to hell and back.

852
01:14:53,461 --> 01:14:55,897
Eli. Let me buy you lunch.

853
01:14:55,997 --> 01:14:59,508
Ruby got it already.
How about I take you up on it tomorrow?

854
01:15:04,004 --> 01:15:07,774
I saw all the reporters out
in the courtyard just now.

855
01:15:07,874 --> 01:15:10,576
Any more of that publicity
and you will be ensured a place...

856
01:15:10,676 --> 01:15:12,580
on the lucrative lecture circuit.

857
01:15:12,680 --> 01:15:17,867
You'd think the Nobel Prize alone would
ensure you that kind of notoriety. I...

858
01:15:22,838 --> 01:15:25,521
The snails are eating my basil.

859
01:15:25,621 --> 01:15:27,357
Look at... Scarred leaves.

860
01:15:27,457 --> 01:15:30,025
A week ago, these leaves...

861
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:34,032
were plump, moist, unblemished.

862
01:15:34,132 --> 01:15:36,866
So, you never heard anything.

863
01:15:36,966 --> 01:15:38,932
I was listening for the bicycle.

864
01:15:39,032 --> 01:15:41,805
But you never heard
a struggle or anything like that.

865
01:15:41,905 --> 01:15:44,242
I wasn't listening for a struggle.
If I was listening for a struggle...

866
01:15:44,342 --> 01:15:46,109
then I would have heard
the struggle.

867
01:15:46,209 --> 01:15:49,047
- Maybe I didn't hear it.
- Right.

868
01:15:49,147 --> 01:15:50,746
I have to kill 'em.

869
01:15:50,846 --> 01:15:52,948
Who?

870
01:15:53,048 --> 01:15:56,922
The snails.
They have to die.

871
01:16:01,092 --> 01:16:03,461
Just a minute.

872
01:16:03,561 --> 01:16:05,463
Hey.

873
01:16:05,563 --> 01:16:08,466
You told City Hall
your bike was stolen.

874
01:16:08,566 --> 01:16:10,901
It was stolen.

875
01:16:11,001 --> 01:16:12,904
Your bike's in the garage.

876
01:16:13,004 --> 01:16:16,070
I brought it home
from Equator Books myself.

877
01:16:16,170 --> 01:16:18,008
No, I'm telling you it was stolen.

878
01:16:18,108 --> 01:16:21,879
Well, I'm telling you...

879
01:16:21,979 --> 01:16:26,582
you wouldn't be the first guy that told
a white lie to get a girl into the sack.

880
01:16:26,682 --> 01:16:29,453
Max, I asked you to leave her alone.

881
01:16:29,553 --> 01:16:32,154
Hey. She's crazy about you.

882
01:16:32,254 --> 01:16:34,525
She cried, carried on
when she heard what happened.

883
01:16:34,625 --> 01:16:37,090
So I wouldn't worry about it.

884
01:16:37,190 --> 01:16:39,773
Unless there's somethin'
to be worried about.

885
01:17:02,037 --> 01:17:04,653
Yeah, I remember.

886
01:17:04,753 --> 01:17:06,625
Kid's only got a 20.

887
01:17:06,725 --> 01:17:10,629
I don't got no singles.
I gotta count out 14 bucks of coins.

888
01:17:10,729 --> 01:17:13,131
He's anxious, jumpy and shit.

889
01:17:13,231 --> 01:17:15,183
I keep losing count.

890
01:17:19,655 --> 01:17:21,635
George Gastner?

891
01:17:21,735 --> 01:17:23,676
If he didn't have
the bicycle with him...

892
01:17:23,776 --> 01:17:25,908
I was listening for the wrong thing.

893
01:17:26,008 --> 01:17:27,975
George Gastner...

894
01:17:28,075 --> 01:17:30,915
formerly of Billingsworth
Psychiatric Hospital...

895
01:17:31,015 --> 01:17:33,953
by way of Cheski-Vacuri
Psychiatric Hospital...

896
01:17:34,053 --> 01:17:36,584
with a brief stint in
the Fraser Scott Psych Ward?

897
01:17:36,684 --> 01:17:40,267
You're not here
about the bicycle, are you?

898
01:17:54,356 --> 01:17:56,274
City.

899
01:17:56,374 --> 01:17:59,710
I thought you weren't gonna show.

900
01:17:59,810 --> 01:18:03,526
- Sorry.
- Me too.

901
01:18:05,801 --> 01:18:07,753
I want to fuck you so bad.

902
01:18:07,853 --> 01:18:11,272
Ho, ho. I was hoping you'd
say something like that.

903
01:18:12,975 --> 01:18:14,955
But...

904
01:18:15,055 --> 01:18:17,024
I can't.

905
01:18:17,124 --> 01:18:19,103
No. We'll go somewhere.

906
01:18:20,349 --> 01:18:22,430
I'm with someone else now.

907
01:18:22,530 --> 01:18:24,145
What?

908
01:18:25,654 --> 01:18:28,452
Why did you even come here then?

909
01:18:29,525 --> 01:18:32,208
I wanted to say I'm sorry.

910
01:18:50,979 --> 01:18:52,970
Barkley.

911
01:18:54,149 --> 01:18:56,140
What?

912
01:19:06,028 --> 01:19:08,446
Why didn't I see this coming?

913
01:19:21,510 --> 01:19:24,536
It's right this way.

914
01:19:28,517 --> 01:19:32,566
It's the, um, fireplace
and kitchen...

915
01:19:32,666 --> 01:19:34,836
and, uh, bath.

916
01:19:34,936 --> 01:19:38,405
Uh, I wasn't gonna
rent it out so soon after...

917
01:19:38,505 --> 01:19:41,122
but we really do need
the money right now.

918
01:19:44,766 --> 01:19:46,847
He seems like a nice young man.

919
01:19:46,947 --> 01:19:49,888
Solid, works in used cars.

920
01:19:49,988 --> 01:19:51,963
Cool.

921
01:19:53,375 --> 01:19:55,809
And maybe you should offer
to help him unload.

922
01:20:11,927 --> 01:20:13,845
He seems to have it
all under control.

923
01:20:13,945 --> 01:20:16,848
Well, Barkley,
that's not very welcoming.

924
01:20:16,948 --> 01:20:20,819
It's just, uh, my back's
been spasming all day.

925
01:20:20,919 --> 01:20:25,222
It still hurts from when I was kidnapped,
so I really don't think I can help him.

926
01:20:25,322 --> 01:20:29,593
You know, I did tell him about George's
suicide, but it didn't seem to bother him.

927
01:20:29,693 --> 01:20:33,064
Yeah. Some people
are just practical.

928
01:20:33,164 --> 01:20:37,585
He has a lovely girlfriend
that lives in town. She's there.

929
01:20:48,030 --> 01:20:50,246
Barkley! Oh, my God!

930
01:20:50,346 --> 01:20:52,323
Um, I'm okay.

931
01:20:53,635 --> 01:20:56,229
Cute couple.

932
01:21:01,243 --> 01:21:04,129
- You think so?
- Yeah.

933
01:21:04,229 --> 01:21:06,131
Yes.

934
01:21:06,231 --> 01:21:08,729
It seems to have
hit its stride, really...

935
01:21:08,829 --> 01:21:13,902
with all these options for making
quantum dots biocompatible...

936
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:17,808
therefore allowing
individual molecules...

937
01:21:17,908 --> 01:21:19,884
to be traced in living cells.

938
01:21:21,430 --> 01:21:25,059
And you sell used cars for a living?

939
01:21:26,235 --> 01:21:29,553
I was a chemistry major
at Ohio State, but...

940
01:21:29,653 --> 01:21:31,055
I didn't...

941
01:21:31,155 --> 01:21:34,559
I didn't have the funds
to finish my degree, so...

942
01:21:34,659 --> 01:21:36,623
Yeah. Now I'm in cars.

943
01:21:36,723 --> 01:21:40,429
But you seem
to have knowledge that...

944
01:21:40,529 --> 01:21:43,597
far exceeds the reaches
of undergraduate chemistry.

945
01:21:43,697 --> 01:21:46,267
Thaddeus is like a star.

946
01:21:46,367 --> 01:21:49,004
His brilliance is baffled...

947
01:21:49,104 --> 01:21:53,221
by the congesting circumstance
of impeding planets.

948
01:21:54,396 --> 01:21:56,814
Sharon is a poet.

949
01:21:56,914 --> 01:22:00,284
But I'm a bit of an autodidact,
which I gotta tell ya...

950
01:22:00,384 --> 01:22:04,121
is one of the reasons I was very excited
when I learned my new landlord...

951
01:22:04,221 --> 01:22:07,039
was Dr. Eli Michaelson.

952
01:22:10,846 --> 01:22:13,062
Barkley doesn't even know...

953
01:22:13,162 --> 01:22:15,548
how big a single molecule is.

954
01:22:16,918 --> 01:22:18,668
Do you, Barkley?

955
01:22:18,768 --> 01:22:20,016
Yes.

956
01:22:24,259 --> 01:22:25,339
Generally.

957
01:22:25,439 --> 01:22:27,345
Well...

958
01:22:27,445 --> 01:22:29,847
obviously it depends
on the structure...

959
01:22:29,947 --> 01:22:34,549
and the number of atoms
in the molecule.

960
01:22:34,649 --> 01:22:38,854
On the small end of the range, it's of the
same order as the bond lengths, Barkley.

961
01:22:40,553 --> 01:22:42,460
Typically...

962
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,462
one to two angstroms.

963
01:22:44,562 --> 01:22:47,330
Good boy.

964
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:49,998
Why don't you come visit me
at the lab sometime?

965
01:22:50,098 --> 01:22:52,037
I think you'll find it enlightening.

966
01:22:52,137 --> 01:22:54,179
Are you serious?

967
01:22:56,325 --> 01:22:58,418
That would be great.

968
01:23:12,641 --> 01:23:14,688
What the fuck are you doing, man?

969
01:23:14,788 --> 01:23:17,324
- That is a great man.
- What?

970
01:23:17,424 --> 01:23:19,831
I could have made him so proud.

971
01:23:19,931 --> 01:23:22,266
I would have followed
in his footsteps...

972
01:23:22,366 --> 01:23:24,601
worked by his side.

973
01:23:24,701 --> 01:23:29,405
- Carried on his life's work.
- Thaddeus, this isn't part of the plan. Leave.

974
01:23:29,505 --> 01:23:32,790
He would have loved me
like a father should love a son.

975
01:23:34,663 --> 01:23:36,913
Sorry, Bro.
I'm not going anywhere.

976
01:23:37,013 --> 01:23:39,296
I'm gonna...

977
01:23:43,939 --> 01:23:46,453
"Leave."

978
01:23:46,553 --> 01:23:48,475
Maybe you should leave.

979
01:24:34,156 --> 01:24:36,989
Hurry up. I'm hungry.

980
01:24:39,327 --> 01:24:41,795
Hurry up, Barkley.
I'm hungry.

981
01:24:44,366 --> 01:24:46,596
Hurry up, Barkley.
I'm hungry.

982
01:25:24,806 --> 01:25:26,820
Yeah.

983
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:30,537
Hello. Good morning, Doctor.

984
01:25:32,781 --> 01:25:35,166
Yeah.

985
01:25:35,266 --> 01:25:37,635
- Look at this.
- No. Actually, why don't you sit there?

986
01:25:37,735 --> 01:25:39,653
Doctor.

987
01:25:42,971 --> 01:25:46,142
- This is a treat. Thank you, Thaddeus.
- It's my pleasure, Doctor.

988
01:25:46,242 --> 01:25:48,196
Call me Eli.

989
01:25:52,481 --> 01:25:56,584
I'd love the recipe.

990
01:25:56,684 --> 01:26:01,040
- Unless it's a family secret.
- I like to think of us as family.

991
01:26:05,914 --> 01:26:08,246
Does that include me?

992
01:26:13,488 --> 01:26:15,547
Going somewhere?

993
01:26:17,125 --> 01:26:19,240
It seems...

994
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:23,247
that you visited a cash machine
on the night in question.

995
01:26:23,347 --> 01:26:24,878
Look...

996
01:26:24,978 --> 01:26:27,885
I had one 20,
and I took it from City's wallet.

997
01:26:27,985 --> 01:26:33,357
Because you found out
you only had $2.57 in your account.

998
01:26:33,457 --> 01:26:35,691
I checked the bank records.

999
01:26:35,791 --> 01:26:38,393
You're saying that
you stole 20 from City?

1000
01:26:38,493 --> 01:26:41,230
- I didn't steal it. I left an I.O.U.
- She never said...

1001
01:26:41,330 --> 01:26:45,101
anything to me about an I.O.U.

1002
01:26:45,201 --> 01:26:47,711
You know her cat?

1003
01:26:49,024 --> 01:26:51,572
She's got this cat. It's a thief.

1004
01:26:51,672 --> 01:26:53,944
- That's funny.
- What's funny?

1005
01:26:54,044 --> 01:26:58,382
A certain Wil Cavalere was assaulted
at an A.T.M. on the same night.

1006
01:26:58,482 --> 01:27:03,753
His attacker arrived
wearing a paper bag mask...

1007
01:27:03,853 --> 01:27:06,757
and departed with
Wil Cavalere's thumb.

1008
01:27:06,857 --> 01:27:10,891
- So?
- Bits of a paper bag and pieces of a bulbous nose...

1009
01:27:10,991 --> 01:27:15,028
were found in the middle
of the living room fireplace...

1010
01:27:15,128 --> 01:27:18,435
bearing traces
of Mr. Cavalere's blood.

1011
01:27:18,535 --> 01:27:21,602
There was a fire going on in the fireplace
when I got home that morning.

1012
01:27:21,702 --> 01:27:24,508
- I told you this before, Max.
- Oh, God!

1013
01:27:24,608 --> 01:27:26,241
I mean... Look at me.

1014
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:30,647
You don't think that
I'm actually capable... What...

1015
01:27:30,747 --> 01:27:34,152
It sounds like a tall tale to me.

1016
01:27:34,252 --> 01:27:36,783
Look...

1017
01:27:36,883 --> 01:27:39,352
your red Doc Martens...

1018
01:27:39,452 --> 01:27:43,361
turned up with traces
of Wil Cavalere's blood.

1019
01:27:43,461 --> 01:27:45,329
- I lost those shoes.
- When?

1020
01:27:45,429 --> 01:27:47,798
That night.
That night at her apartment.

1021
01:27:47,898 --> 01:27:50,132
- That's funny.
- What's funny?

1022
01:27:50,232 --> 01:27:53,570
We found those shoes
in your closet...

1023
01:27:53,670 --> 01:27:55,607
in a shoe box...

1024
01:27:55,707 --> 01:27:57,624
buried in the back.

1025
01:27:58,960 --> 01:28:00,951
How can that be?

1026
01:28:10,772 --> 01:28:13,639
Barkley, honey, we need to talk.

1027
01:28:17,812 --> 01:28:20,563
Okay.

1028
01:28:20,663 --> 01:28:24,035
There is no love like a mother's love.

1029
01:28:24,135 --> 01:28:28,337
Mom convinced Max
to give me a chance to prove myself...

1030
01:28:28,437 --> 01:28:30,875
maybe to even help us.

1031
01:28:30,975 --> 01:28:34,407
Now I just had to figure out
a way to get Thaddeus to crack.

1032
01:28:34,507 --> 01:28:36,157
I could have loved her.

1033
01:28:37,265 --> 01:28:39,150
What are you doing here? Huh?

1034
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:41,382
She unlocked something
deep inside of me.

1035
01:28:41,482 --> 01:28:43,387
You knew that...

1036
01:28:43,487 --> 01:28:46,702
and you took her away from me.

1037
01:29:06,761 --> 01:29:09,079
Sarah.

1038
01:29:12,767 --> 01:29:15,551
Will you tell Barkley...

1039
01:29:15,651 --> 01:29:17,730
to stay out of my apartment?

1040
01:29:18,740 --> 01:29:20,720
He went into your apartment?

1041
01:29:20,820 --> 01:29:21,923
Yeah.

1042
01:29:22,023 --> 01:29:24,428
You told me a guy
killed himself in there.

1043
01:29:24,528 --> 01:29:28,129
- You didn't tell me your son was unstable.
- What did he do?

1044
01:29:28,229 --> 01:29:30,480
He threatened me.

1045
01:29:34,856 --> 01:29:37,336
You know what?
I'm sorry. It won't happen again.

1046
01:29:37,436 --> 01:29:40,243
I'll talk to him. Okay?
I promise.

1047
01:29:40,343 --> 01:29:43,579
Sorry.
Can you hand me the measuring cup?

1048
01:29:43,679 --> 01:29:45,098
Sorry.

1049
01:29:51,306 --> 01:29:54,742
I really like living here.
He's spoiling it.

1050
01:30:01,549 --> 01:30:04,598
Hey. I need some prints run on this.

1051
01:30:04,698 --> 01:30:08,505
No "hello"? No "how are you?"

1052
01:30:08,605 --> 01:30:12,071
I'm not big on foreplay,
but you treat me this way, I feel dirty.

1053
01:30:12,171 --> 01:30:14,843
I need it A.S.A.P.

1054
01:30:14,943 --> 01:30:19,264
There you are.
Sweet-talk me, and I'm a pushover.

1055
01:30:28,573 --> 01:30:30,491
Three years ago, Sharon...

1056
01:30:30,591 --> 01:30:33,567
a. k. a. City Hall...

1057
01:30:34,912 --> 01:30:38,062
escaped from
the Gilissen Hospital...

1058
01:30:38,162 --> 01:30:40,500
for the Criminally Insane.

1059
01:30:40,600 --> 01:30:43,167
She was committed for
burning her father alive.

1060
01:30:43,267 --> 01:30:45,538
That's where she met
fellow patient...

1061
01:30:45,638 --> 01:30:47,614
Thaddeus James.

1062
01:30:49,694 --> 01:30:52,945
And it seems your father and I...

1063
01:30:53,045 --> 01:30:56,147
knew the James family
once upon a time.

1064
01:31:06,878 --> 01:31:09,628
It's FBI business.
You know I can't talk about it.

1065
01:31:09,728 --> 01:31:11,632
When will you be back?

1066
01:31:11,732 --> 01:31:13,696
Couple of days.

1067
01:31:13,796 --> 01:31:16,185
We have cocktails
at the Pedersens' Friday night.

1068
01:31:17,855 --> 01:31:20,741
If I'm not back,
take your little friend Beth.

1069
01:31:20,841 --> 01:31:23,840
For God sakes.

1070
01:31:23,940 --> 01:31:27,728
I'm just helping her out.
She's having a hard time keeping up.

1071
01:31:33,404 --> 01:31:36,840
Thaddeus James.
Detective Mariner.

1072
01:31:38,109 --> 01:31:40,527
Well, is there anything
I can do for you, Detective?

1073
01:31:40,627 --> 01:31:42,841
Barkley Michaelson threatened you.

1074
01:31:45,783 --> 01:31:48,067
His mother, Sarah Michaelson,
told us about it.

1075
01:31:48,167 --> 01:31:50,869
Look, you know, the kid...

1076
01:31:50,969 --> 01:31:53,407
he seems harmless, but...

1077
01:31:53,507 --> 01:31:57,007
I'm here to tell you he's not.

1078
01:31:57,107 --> 01:31:58,777
History can't be denied.

1079
01:31:58,877 --> 01:32:02,412
I know that you're seeing...

1080
01:32:02,512 --> 01:32:06,685
that Sharon Hall that
Michaelson is obsessed by.

1081
01:32:06,785 --> 01:32:09,122
If you care for her...

1082
01:32:09,222 --> 01:32:13,234
I would take her very far from here.

1083
01:33:52,477 --> 01:33:54,395
Hello, Brother.

1084
01:33:54,495 --> 01:33:59,462
By now, you should have found
a sampling of City's lovejuice.

1085
01:33:59,562 --> 01:34:01,484
She did put up a fight, but...

1086
01:34:02,553 --> 01:34:04,735
she's since been, let's just say...

1087
01:34:04,835 --> 01:34:06,756
subdued.

1088
01:34:08,493 --> 01:34:12,312
Look, I've kidnapped dear old dad...

1089
01:34:12,412 --> 01:34:14,511
and I want a million
for his release.

1090
01:34:14,611 --> 01:34:17,816
You can think about it.
I am patient.

1091
01:34:17,916 --> 01:34:21,418
Oh, yeah. I can subsist
for weeks dining on City Hall.

1092
01:34:21,518 --> 01:34:26,056
But if I do not receive the money
by the time City's flesh has been consumed...

1093
01:34:26,156 --> 01:34:29,029
well, at that point
I'm gonna have to embark...

1094
01:34:29,129 --> 01:34:34,062
on the less savory task
of consuming our father.

1095
01:34:34,162 --> 01:34:36,767
I'm gonna need some
pretty heavy marinade for that.

1096
01:34:53,104 --> 01:34:56,619
Have you lost your mind, Barkley?

1097
01:34:56,719 --> 01:34:59,642
You needed to know
what it feels like to be kidnapped.

1098
01:35:11,622 --> 01:35:13,556
So...

1099
01:35:14,926 --> 01:35:17,074
Harriman James.

1100
01:35:17,174 --> 01:35:21,245
You fucked his wife,
stole his theories, drove him to suicide.

1101
01:35:21,345 --> 01:35:23,323
Oh, bullshit.

1102
01:35:25,703 --> 01:35:30,388
Glynnis James was cute and she screwed
a lot of men, but I was not one of them.

1103
01:35:30,488 --> 01:35:32,635
So how do you explain
all the checks?

1104
01:35:33,511 --> 01:35:35,274
What checks?

1105
01:35:36,747 --> 01:35:40,683
All the checks that you sent her
throughout the years.

1106
01:35:47,825 --> 01:35:51,374
Harriman James was my friend.

1107
01:35:51,474 --> 01:35:53,976
He left his pregnant wife...

1108
01:35:54,076 --> 01:35:56,045
penniless.

1109
01:35:56,145 --> 01:35:59,952
When I could, I helped her out.

1110
01:36:00,052 --> 01:36:02,422
That's really touching.
It is.

1111
01:36:02,522 --> 01:36:05,122
I just don't understand why
you would be nice to her...

1112
01:36:05,222 --> 01:36:07,791
when you've never been nice
to anyone in your entire fuckin' life!

1113
01:36:07,891 --> 01:36:10,392
Because I do not believe
in helping those...

1114
01:36:10,492 --> 01:36:13,164
who can help themselves,
like you, for instance.

1115
01:36:13,264 --> 01:36:16,299
Oh, I have a mountain of anger...

1116
01:36:16,399 --> 01:36:21,640
and, uh, I'd say a fair amount
of despair that informs...

1117
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:23,706
pretty much everything that I do.

1118
01:36:23,806 --> 01:36:26,376
Do you know where that stems from?

1119
01:36:26,476 --> 01:36:30,384
Being born the son
of an asshole like you.

1120
01:36:30,484 --> 01:36:32,718
- What are you talking about?
- Harriman James...

1121
01:36:32,818 --> 01:36:36,819
had nothing to do with your Nobel Prize-winning
work in single-molecule spectroscopy?

1122
01:36:36,919 --> 01:36:39,292
He piddled around in it.
I made it work.

1123
01:36:39,392 --> 01:36:40,991
Do you really think...

1124
01:36:41,091 --> 01:36:44,864
that holding me for ransom
is gonna accomplish anything?

1125
01:36:44,964 --> 01:36:48,498
And besides, who do you think is gonna pay?
Your mother is broke, Barkley.

1126
01:36:48,598 --> 01:36:50,870
Thaddeus is going to pay.

1127
01:36:50,970 --> 01:36:53,407
- Thaddeus?
- Thaddeus James.

1128
01:36:53,507 --> 01:36:55,425
Your son.

1129
01:36:57,495 --> 01:37:00,847
Even if he was my son,
which he is not...

1130
01:37:00,947 --> 01:37:02,849
how is he gonna pay?

1131
01:37:02,949 --> 01:37:06,482
He's a used car dealer, huh? Where's
he gonna come up with that kind of money?

1132
01:37:06,582 --> 01:37:08,663
Uh, Thaddeus was my kidnapper.

1133
01:37:09,974 --> 01:37:13,022
If any of this is true...

1134
01:37:13,122 --> 01:37:15,374
why are you telling me this now?

1135
01:37:20,017 --> 01:37:22,700
Because up until now,
Thaddeus held all the cards.

1136
01:37:22,800 --> 01:37:25,706
Until I realized
that he wasn't lying...

1137
01:37:25,806 --> 01:37:28,338
about you and Harriman.

1138
01:37:28,438 --> 01:37:31,379
Look at this.
Recognize this?

1139
01:37:31,479 --> 01:37:33,847
Oh, yeah. I scanned it.

1140
01:37:33,947 --> 01:37:36,627
And I can have it all over
the Internet in seconds.

1141
01:37:40,971 --> 01:37:43,030
Your little talk didn't work.

1142
01:37:49,580 --> 01:37:53,500
Well, Barkley is my son,
and I love him...

1143
01:37:53,600 --> 01:37:56,132
but I think we should
call the police.

1144
01:37:56,232 --> 01:37:58,200
No police.

1145
01:37:58,300 --> 01:38:00,972
He's gotta be...

1146
01:38:01,072 --> 01:38:02,992
He's gotta be bluffing.

1147
01:38:07,465 --> 01:38:10,480
Uh, delivery for Thaddeus James.

1148
01:38:11,883 --> 01:38:13,860
Hey. Just sign here.

1149
01:38:16,974 --> 01:38:19,033
Good night.

1150
01:38:26,183 --> 01:38:28,174
I didn't order anything.

1151
01:38:44,635 --> 01:38:46,615
"Preheat oven to 350.

1152
01:38:46,715 --> 01:38:49,156
Cook for 20 minutes
or until golden brown."

1153
01:38:49,256 --> 01:38:51,231
What?

1154
01:39:02,787 --> 01:39:05,436
What is it?

1155
01:39:05,536 --> 01:39:07,205
Oh, God.

1156
01:39:07,305 --> 01:39:10,783
The sick fucker.

1157
01:39:11,695 --> 01:39:13,945
I think it's City.

1158
01:39:14,045 --> 01:39:17,215
Not again.

1159
01:39:17,315 --> 01:39:19,652
He threatened
to do this to Meredith...

1160
01:39:19,752 --> 01:39:21,953
but I never thought
he would actually...

1161
01:39:22,053 --> 01:39:24,019
I just found my dad.

1162
01:39:24,119 --> 01:39:27,190
I'm not gonna let
that crazy bastard eat him.

1163
01:39:32,850 --> 01:39:36,000
- Hello?
- Hello, Brother.

1164
01:39:36,100 --> 01:39:39,337
Want the recipe?
It's an old family secret.

1165
01:39:39,437 --> 01:39:41,206
Put the money...

1166
01:39:41,306 --> 01:39:43,176
in Aunt Lillie's old beige carry-on.

1167
01:39:43,276 --> 01:39:45,178
Mom will find it for you.

1168
01:39:45,278 --> 01:39:48,046
Go to the bus station in
Stovepipe Wells, Death Valley.

1169
01:39:48,146 --> 01:39:50,680
It'll take you
six hours by car.

1170
01:39:50,780 --> 01:39:54,986
Put the money in locker number 126.

1171
01:39:55,086 --> 01:39:56,821
Close it. Lock it.

1172
01:39:56,921 --> 01:39:59,899
Get in your stolen car and go home.

1173
01:40:10,254 --> 01:40:13,269
At 7:00 sharp, answer your phone...

1174
01:40:13,369 --> 01:40:16,952
- or else dear old dad is cooked.
- Fuck!

1175
01:40:27,104 --> 01:40:30,288
"Among the anthropophagi...

1176
01:40:30,388 --> 01:40:33,293
people's friends are people's sarcophagi."

1177
01:41:44,048 --> 01:41:46,000
Now what?

1178
01:41:46,100 --> 01:41:48,881
Photographs,
courtesy of Thaddeus James.

1179
01:41:51,422 --> 01:41:54,437
Far too many shots
of your philandering penis for my taste.

1180
01:41:54,537 --> 01:41:55,822
Mom deserves better.

1181
01:42:02,599 --> 01:42:04,613
Ain't that the truth.

1182
01:42:04,713 --> 01:42:07,520
But I'll always love you, Eli,
'cause you gave me Barkley.

1183
01:42:07,620 --> 01:42:09,489
Please believe me.

1184
01:42:09,589 --> 01:42:13,359
You are the only woman I ever loved.

1185
01:42:13,459 --> 01:42:17,629
We're getting divorced, Eli,
and I'm taking you to the cleaners.

1186
01:42:17,729 --> 01:42:19,667
Well...

1187
01:42:19,767 --> 01:42:21,668
good luck.

1188
01:42:21,768 --> 01:42:24,002
I don't need luck.

1189
01:42:24,102 --> 01:42:27,305
A DNA test will link you
to Thaddeus's paternity.

1190
01:42:27,405 --> 01:42:32,260
And Harriman's papers will bring the merits
of your Nobel Prize into question.

1191
01:42:33,330 --> 01:42:35,355
Imagine the humiliation.

1192
01:42:39,870 --> 01:42:45,157
I bet it was your idea,
this whole kidnapping thing, wasn't it?

1193
01:42:45,257 --> 01:42:48,006
No. Actually, it was all Barkley.

1194
01:42:49,079 --> 01:42:52,032
Clever kid,
that son of ours.

1195
01:42:52,132 --> 01:42:55,266
Guess I really do
take after you, Dad.

1196
01:43:11,101 --> 01:43:14,785
I can't believe I'm getting money-laundering
instructions from my mother.

1197
01:43:14,885 --> 01:43:17,568
We're splitting that money 50-50.

1198
01:43:25,682 --> 01:43:27,309
Max?

1199
01:43:29,987 --> 01:43:32,535
It's your one mil.

1200
01:43:32,635 --> 01:43:35,475
Figured if I returned it
to you legitimately...

1201
01:43:35,575 --> 01:43:38,776
Eli would be getting 50% in the divorce, so...

1202
01:43:38,876 --> 01:43:41,545
And this way...

1203
01:43:41,645 --> 01:43:43,566
you could share it with me.

1204
01:43:45,335 --> 01:43:47,769
We could live pretty well
on this in Montana.

1205
01:43:51,141 --> 01:43:54,589
I'm not leaving my job.

1206
01:43:54,689 --> 01:43:55,667
That'd be fine.

1207
01:44:05,856 --> 01:44:07,517
Hi, Barkley.

1208
01:44:10,194 --> 01:44:12,275
Max.

1209
01:44:12,375 --> 01:44:15,593
Surveillance tape from the mall.

1210
01:44:18,202 --> 01:44:20,329
Nice disguise.

1211
01:44:21,939 --> 01:44:24,169
But I gotta ask you.

1212
01:44:25,242 --> 01:44:27,992
The breast...

1213
01:44:28,092 --> 01:44:30,205
with the string beans on the side.

1214
01:44:31,281 --> 01:44:34,167
Marzipan.

1215
01:44:34,267 --> 01:44:36,169
A marzipan breast.

1216
01:44:36,269 --> 01:44:39,172
A gallon ofblood.
You can buy anything in L.A.

1217
01:44:39,272 --> 01:44:41,838
As for City,
Mom arranged for her to go back...

1218
01:44:41,938 --> 01:44:44,574
to the Gilissen Hospital
for the Criminally Insane...

1219
01:44:44,674 --> 01:44:46,645
where I am sure that her artwork
will never fully be appreciated.

1220
01:44:46,745 --> 01:44:48,679
where I am sure that her artwork
will never fully be appreciated.

1221
01:44:48,779 --> 01:44:52,290
We make our choices, don't we, City?

1222
01:44:55,402 --> 01:44:58,098
Sometimes they're made for us, baby.

1223
01:45:02,710 --> 01:45:05,629
I finished my thesis.

1224
01:45:05,729 --> 01:45:07,305
I even got it published.

1225
01:45:08,916 --> 01:45:11,768
To quote the Jacket cover:

1226
01:45:11,868 --> 01:45:14,377
"It isn't evil to eat the dead.

1227
01:45:15,456 --> 01:45:17,447
"It's recycling.

1228
01:45:19,126 --> 01:45:22,755
True evil is to eat a man alive."

1229
01:45:53,527 --> 01:45:55,507
Dr. Michaelson?

1230
01:45:57,676 --> 01:46:00,713
I'm having trouble
understanding...

1231
01:46:00,813 --> 01:46:03,051
how to derive
the transition kinetics...

1232
01:46:03,151 --> 01:46:07,233
from the autocorrelation function
using the photon counting measurements.

1233
01:46:12,346 --> 01:46:15,543
Kinetics. Yes.

1234
01:46:19,787 --> 01:46:24,236
Just like a measly molecule,
man can so swiftly go...

1235
01:46:24,336 --> 01:46:28,774
from a glorious state
of high energy...

1236
01:46:28,874 --> 01:46:32,196
to an ignominious one of isolation.

1237
01:46:38,739 --> 01:46:41,090
But then again...

1238
01:46:41,190 --> 01:46:47,045
a molecule that interacts
with other molecules...

1239
01:46:48,883 --> 01:46:51,875
has a much greater potential...

1240
01:46:54,388 --> 01:46:56,340
to luminesce.

1241
01:46:56,440 --> 01:46:58,605
Sir?

1242
01:46:58,705 --> 01:47:00,956
I'm free tonight.

1243
01:47:04,298 --> 01:47:06,289
And you?
