1
00:01:40,913 --> 00:01:43,574
- Here you go, miss.
- Thank you.

2
00:01:45,136 --> 00:01:47,161
Step through, please.

3
00:01:49,232 --> 00:01:51,427
Open your laptop, please.

4
00:01:56,336 --> 00:01:59,238
I guess people take their computers
with them everywhere nowadays.

5
00:01:59,313 --> 00:02:00,678
Security blanket.

6
00:02:00,816 --> 00:02:02,285
Lucky blanket.

7
00:02:03,761 --> 00:02:05,194
Next.

8
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:21,977
Wow, even answer your own door,
senator.

9
00:02:22,063 --> 00:02:24,055
- I' m impressed.
- Front-porch mentality.

10
00:02:24,177 --> 00:02:25,804
Ilike to know who's visiting.

11
00:02:25,937 --> 00:02:29,305
Plus, my secretary, Laura,
just stepped out for an early lunch.

12
00:02:29,648 --> 00:02:31,879
Caroline Eldridge from
Family First is visiting.

13
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:34,783
You're early. I like that. Come in.

14
00:02:38,513 --> 00:02:41,176
- Let's take the sofa.
- Okay.

15
00:02:43,217 --> 00:02:46,085
Hope you don't mind if I take
this out.

16
00:02:46,163 --> 00:02:49,426
My hard drive is now officially
my only source of memory...

17
00:02:49,489 --> 00:02:53,256
...and I wanna get all those
old -fashioned values down accurately.

18
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:56,460
Now, as you know, we're putting
together our Family First brochure...

19
00:02:56,528 --> 00:02:59,293
...and we've got pictures
that we could use captions for.

20
00:02:59,826 --> 00:03:01,818
- Fire away.
- Okay.

21
00:03:01,936 --> 00:03:04,804
Let's start with this one.

22
00:03:04,882 --> 00:03:08,784
That's me and some of the staff
in the Gulf of Mexico after Katrina.

23
00:03:09,203 --> 00:03:11,193
Heartbreaking stuff.

24
00:03:11,633 --> 00:03:12,999
Okay.

25
00:03:13,139 --> 00:03:14,662
Let's call this:

26
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:17,327
"Senator Sachs and staff
lend a hand in hurricane relief.

27
00:03:20,498 --> 00:03:22,296
- Good.
- How about that?

28
00:03:22,418 --> 00:03:23,977
That's one of my former interns...

29
00:03:24,114 --> 00:03:25,809
...Josh.

30
00:03:25,937 --> 00:03:27,963
Must have been taken his last day
of work.

31
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,051
Let's call it:

32
00:03:30,386 --> 00:03:34,516
- "Intern program a success."
- Okay.

33
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:36,618
Met a lot of good kids that way.

34
00:03:37,331 --> 00:03:38,923
I'll bet.

35
00:03:40,915 --> 00:03:42,576
How about that one?

36
00:03:42,707 --> 00:03:44,334
Wait, let me try.

37
00:03:44,468 --> 00:03:48,527
"Intern program has fringe benefits"?

38
00:03:49,203 --> 00:03:50,693
Let's see.

39
00:03:51,858 --> 00:03:54,952
- Let's call it "extramarital Sachs."
- Who are you?

40
00:03:55,027 --> 00:03:58,190
Someone who thinks it's a bit
hypocritical for the past two years...

41
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:01,023
...you've tried to limit the civil rights
of gay individuals...

42
00:04:01,105 --> 00:04:03,199
...while being gay yourself.
- Lady...

43
00:04:03,315 --> 00:04:05,681
Preach family first
as if there's one kind of family.

44
00:04:05,779 --> 00:04:09,579
I don't know what you think you got
but let me explain something to you.

45
00:04:09,619 --> 00:04:13,021
What I' ve got is a signed statement
by Josh.

46
00:04:13,075 --> 00:04:16,908
We've got canceled checks and
he's ready to turn over the love notes.

47
00:04:16,947 --> 00:04:20,179
- Laura.
- Out to lunch, remember?

48
00:04:20,243 --> 00:04:22,006
It's gonna be your word against his.

49
00:04:22,131 --> 00:04:24,566
We're running his tomorrow.

50
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:27,026
I work for David Shane
at the New York Courier.

51
00:04:27,124 --> 00:04:28,181
Jesus Christ.

52
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:30,102
Josh came to us seven
months ago...

53
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:32,286
...and thought we'd be interested
in knowing...

54
00:04:32,403 --> 00:04:35,464
...that he's not the only handsome
skeleton in your closet.

55
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,100
So we thought we'd give you
an opportunity to respond.

56
00:04:39,668 --> 00:04:41,694
Anything you want.

57
00:04:42,836 --> 00:04:46,601
I will give you anything
that you want.

58
00:04:46,643 --> 00:04:48,134
Anything.

59
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:53,354
I will give... I will give you anything
that you want.

60
00:04:53,429 --> 00:04:54,554
Anything.

61
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,369
You just did, senator.

62
00:04:56,884 --> 00:04:59,077
You just did.

63
00:04:59,956 --> 00:05:01,253
Tell me you got that, Miles.

64
00:05:01,396 --> 00:05:03,091
Please tell me you got that.

65
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,483
I got it, you psychopath.

66
00:05:04,628 --> 00:05:06,562
Jump on the shuttle,
get down to the paper.

67
00:05:06,677 --> 00:05:09,168
And we'll get fantastically,
exceedingly drunk.

68
00:05:11,861 --> 00:05:14,727
I will give you anything that you want,
anything.

69
00:05:14,804 --> 00:05:16,363
One more time.

70
00:05:16,499 --> 00:05:17,966
You transmitted from D.C.

71
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,327
And recorded in New York.

72
00:05:19,476 --> 00:05:21,273
- Go to Legal. It 'll check.
- I intend to.

73
00:05:21,396 --> 00:05:23,490
Also we need to clear
the quote from the intern.

74
00:05:23,606 --> 00:05:25,903
He's at home waiting for the call.

75
00:05:26,901 --> 00:05:28,560
This your headline, David Shane?

76
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:31,563
Yep.

77
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,724
We'll be at Chumley's...

78
00:05:32,885 --> 00:05:36,685
...ordering copious amounts of drinks
on this paper.

79
00:05:37,237 --> 00:05:38,705
God, I love this job.

80
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,829
Hey, hey. To David Shane.

81
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:43,509
May this article bring you
all the prizes you deserve.

82
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:48,100
Fame, alcoholism,
rehab, relapse, rehab.

83
00:05:48,117 --> 00:05:50,778
When you win the Pulitzer,
don't forget the little people.

84
00:05:50,869 --> 00:05:53,600
Oh, fuck the little people.

85
00:05:53,684 --> 00:05:56,449
Hey, you're empty. You buy, I fly.

86
00:05:57,749 --> 00:05:59,684
Excuse me, sweetheart.

87
00:06:04,342 --> 00:06:07,208
Careful, Ro. Next round he might aim
for your lips.

88
00:06:07,286 --> 00:06:10,313
Mr. Arvis Narron.

89
00:06:10,647 --> 00:06:15,413
What kind of name is Arvis?

90
00:06:16,086 --> 00:06:17,074
Family name.

91
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:20,742
Story's been pulled, Ro.

92
00:06:20,887 --> 00:06:23,447
Somebody got to your intern.
Made him clam up.

93
00:06:23,542 --> 00:06:26,510
My guess is somebody with lots
of zeroes.

94
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,371
What?

95
00:06:28,693 --> 00:06:29,956
Well...

96
00:06:30,261 --> 00:06:31,819
...I' m just gonna go call him.

97
00:06:32,567 --> 00:06:34,397
You'll get his lawyer,
just like we did.

98
00:06:34,517 --> 00:06:37,214
Do you know I' ve been working
on this story for six months?

99
00:06:37,302 --> 00:06:38,270
Six.

100
00:06:38,423 --> 00:06:40,617
Take a couple weeks off.
You've earned the break.

101
00:06:40,726 --> 00:06:42,522
I'm gonna go back to the office
right now.

102
00:06:42,646 --> 00:06:44,546
This guy's got a stack
of interns, trust me.

103
00:06:44,662 --> 00:06:48,063
Kolski wants you to take
a couple of weeks off.

104
00:06:48,119 --> 00:06:49,143
That's not a request.

105
00:06:49,302 --> 00:06:51,099
Okay, wait, hold up.

106
00:06:51,575 --> 00:06:52,768
Please tell me...

107
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:56,081
...you're not saying because the paper
endorsed Sachs' last campaign...

108
00:06:56,151 --> 00:06:57,344
...that he's off-limits now.

109
00:06:57,494 --> 00:06:59,860
Please tell me that is not
what you're saying.

110
00:06:59,959 --> 00:07:01,790
- What's up, Narron?
- Get this, Miles.

111
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:04,709
Tomorrow's headline:
"Free Press Dead."

112
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,521
Kolski wants to shut me down
because I went after the senator.

113
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:09,073
Does it ever get to you, Narron?

114
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:13,143
The idea that we're supposed to be
reporting the news not covering it up?

115
00:07:13,175 --> 00:07:15,803
Like we couldn't show the dead
bodies coming back from Iraq.

116
00:07:15,895 --> 00:07:17,919
If you don't see it,
means it never happened.

117
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:19,028
Your source ran dry.

118
00:07:19,192 --> 00:07:21,625
- My source didn't run dry.
- You can't try to cover up...

119
00:07:21,719 --> 00:07:24,654
My source was paid off.

120
00:07:24,726 --> 00:07:26,695
This is a good story, Narron.

121
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:28,607
The story's dead.

122
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:31,984
Classic.

123
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:35,816
Powerful men
protecting powerful men.

124
00:07:35,864 --> 00:07:37,627
I backed you when you wanted
anonymity...

125
00:07:37,752 --> 00:07:40,219
...when you wanted to write under
an old boy's name.

126
00:07:40,311 --> 00:07:43,941
This is not the first time you shut me
down but this is definitely the last.

127
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:49,589
So you tell Kolski keep his paid
vacation because I fucking quit.

128
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,012
Taxi. Hey.

129
00:08:08,983 --> 00:08:10,280
Rowena?

130
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:14,720
Rowena. Wait up.

131
00:08:18,969 --> 00:08:21,836
Wait. Wait.

132
00:08:21,913 --> 00:08:23,345
Fuck.

133
00:08:30,297 --> 00:08:32,789
- Rowena.
- Grace. Shit, you scared me.

134
00:08:32,888 --> 00:08:34,583
You didn't return my phone calls.

135
00:08:34,712 --> 00:08:37,737
Well, yeah, I' ve been pretty busy
working out of town.

136
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:42,812
Oh, yeah. The Senator Sachs scandal.
Don't worry. I didn't tell anyone.

137
00:08:42,808 --> 00:08:44,742
Besides, I got a better story for you.

138
00:08:44,856 --> 00:08:47,086
It's about Harrison Hill.

139
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,820
- Come on.
- We met online.

140
00:08:50,106 --> 00:08:51,436
We did.

141
00:08:51,576 --> 00:08:54,636
He was giving a Q and A, I e-mailed
him and told him how great it was.

142
00:08:54,712 --> 00:08:58,114
You know, stroke a man's dick
and you get him for one night.

143
00:08:58,552 --> 00:09:01,749
Stroke his ego,
you get him for life, huh?

144
00:09:02,265 --> 00:09:04,698
Yeah, we sort of struck up
a friendship online...

145
00:09:04,793 --> 00:09:06,521
...but I could tell that he liked me.

146
00:09:06,649 --> 00:09:09,982
So I decided to come to New York
and accidentally bump into him.

147
00:09:10,041 --> 00:09:12,407
I knew about his fundraiser,
so I bought a ticket...

148
00:09:12,505 --> 00:09:16,805
...walked right up to him and said,
"Harrison, it's Fast Filly."'

149
00:09:18,202 --> 00:09:20,227
I thought he was gonna be angry.

150
00:09:20,345 --> 00:09:23,576
But instead, he's turned on by it.

151
00:09:23,641 --> 00:09:25,666
He likes the balls of it.

152
00:09:25,785 --> 00:09:27,650
"Stick around," he says.

153
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:30,864
Couple hours later, we're doing it
in his Beemer, his hotel suite.

154
00:09:30,938 --> 00:09:32,337
He keeps one, creep.

155
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:35,128
What happened to Chuck?

156
00:09:35,256 --> 00:09:36,986
We're fighting more
than we're fucking.

157
00:09:39,225 --> 00:09:42,286
Anyway, I get back to Philly,
our online stuff gets pretty hot.

158
00:09:42,362 --> 00:09:43,521
He misses me.

159
00:09:43,674 --> 00:09:45,664
I mean, he practically begs me
to move here.

160
00:09:45,787 --> 00:09:47,686
So I check out apartments
and agencies...

161
00:09:47,803 --> 00:09:50,294
...and I wanna tell him, you know,
I'm really excited.

162
00:09:50,394 --> 00:09:54,353
But suddenly,
I can't get ahold of him.

163
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,726
I mean, I sent him a million e-mails
and he just cuts me off.

164
00:09:58,778 --> 00:10:01,440
Cold. Fucker.

165
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:03,888
I know where Hill lives.

166
00:10:05,242 --> 00:10:07,438
I've seen his Armani wife.

167
00:10:08,058 --> 00:10:10,117
He has no idea what I can do
to him.

168
00:10:10,779 --> 00:10:13,975
What is it you want from me this time,
Grace?

169
00:10:14,042 --> 00:10:17,171
Actions have consequences, Ro.

170
00:10:17,243 --> 00:10:19,106
You can't just forget people.

171
00:10:19,226 --> 00:10:22,458
Bury them and pretend like
they never existed.

172
00:10:22,523 --> 00:10:24,491
It always comes back to haunt you.

173
00:10:24,602 --> 00:10:28,595
I wonder what Hill would think if David
Shane publishes a few of his e-mails?

174
00:10:28,635 --> 00:10:30,695
I'm sure the wife would find them
interesting.

175
00:10:33,435 --> 00:10:34,959
Take them. Read them.

176
00:10:35,099 --> 00:10:38,297
Because I' m about an inch away
from ringing this guy's doorbell.

177
00:10:38,363 --> 00:10:40,354
Regards to your mother.

178
00:11:03,195 --> 00:11:07,292
I know where Hill lives.
I've seen his Armani wife.

179
00:11:07,771 --> 00:11:10,639
He has no idea what
I can do to him.

180
00:11:12,668 --> 00:11:16,263
To David Shane. May this article
bring you all the prizes you deserve.

181
00:11:16,316 --> 00:11:19,773
And when you win the Pulitzer,
don't forget the little people.

182
00:11:52,444 --> 00:11:54,674
Here comes the beep.
You know what to do.

183
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:58,985
Hey, Ro, it's Miles, again.
I've been calling for like a week.

184
00:11:59,037 --> 00:12:02,234
Are you looking for a job?
If you are, come on, take me with you.

185
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:04,132
Guess what,
my sister had a boy, Fletcher.

186
00:12:04,253 --> 00:12:07,380
How cool is that? I fly home
in an hour. Call me later, please.

187
00:12:07,453 --> 00:12:11,219
I hate Narron too.
Narron's a dick. Bye.

188
00:12:16,221 --> 00:12:18,620
Here comes the beep.
You know what to do.

189
00:12:19,453 --> 00:12:23,253
Ro, it's Elizabeth Clayton.
Grace's mother.

190
00:12:23,324 --> 00:12:24,690
- I need help.
- Elizabeth.

191
00:12:24,830 --> 00:12:26,263
- Hi.
- Ro? It's Grace.

192
00:12:26,398 --> 00:12:29,456
She's missing. They started calling
from her agency last week.

193
00:12:29,533 --> 00:12:32,934
She goes to New York a lot and
I thought maybe she contacted you.

194
00:12:32,989 --> 00:12:35,617
It's just that I filed
a missing person's report.

195
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,075
A woman drowned in New York.

196
00:12:37,213 --> 00:12:40,205
- They asked for dental records.
- Elizabeth, hang on a second.

197
00:12:40,286 --> 00:12:42,254
- I saw Grace last week.
- Oh, thank God.

198
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:45,664
- Spare yourself a trip.
- But if it is... If I weren't there...

199
00:12:45,725 --> 00:12:50,186
I know half the people at the city
morgue. This is not Grace, I promise.

200
00:12:50,206 --> 00:12:52,299
I'll call you when I get back.

201
00:12:53,406 --> 00:12:56,102
Hi, I' m Rowena Price.
Here to ID a body.

202
00:12:57,727 --> 00:13:00,752
Whoever did this tried to weigh
the body down.

203
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:02,194
Amateur move.

204
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:05,064
- Why is that?
- Didn't work.

205
00:13:05,533 --> 00:13:06,830
Fair warning.

206
00:13:07,262 --> 00:13:09,254
This isn't pretty.

207
00:13:12,735 --> 00:13:13,995
We're guessing an anchor...

208
00:13:14,142 --> 00:13:17,168
...or some sharp metal debris
ripped off the face and neck.

209
00:13:17,246 --> 00:13:20,808
So we're hoping that you could
identify something else.

210
00:13:21,023 --> 00:13:24,049
She has a birthmark, scars...

211
00:13:24,255 --> 00:13:26,247
...and it looks like a tattoo...

212
00:13:53,119 --> 00:13:54,984
Hi, Rowena.

213
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,179
Do you wanna play?

214
00:14:01,503 --> 00:14:03,232
Well, are you coming?

215
00:14:04,896 --> 00:14:06,363
Let's go around back.

216
00:14:08,608 --> 00:14:10,632
Ilive up there.

217
00:14:18,943 --> 00:14:23,506
You do everything you can to protect
your children.

218
00:14:23,648 --> 00:14:25,479
Right schools, right opportunities.

219
00:14:26,207 --> 00:14:29,005
But it's all an illusion.
Nobody's safe.

220
00:14:29,088 --> 00:14:31,112
Who would do this to my daughter?

221
00:14:31,231 --> 00:14:33,223
We're gonna find out, Mrs. Clayton.

222
00:14:33,343 --> 00:14:35,107
Do you mind if I ask you
a few questions?

223
00:14:35,232 --> 00:14:37,928
- Can you excuse us?
- No. She's a friend of the family.

224
00:14:39,872 --> 00:14:42,499
Do you know if your daughter
had been seeing anyone?

225
00:14:42,592 --> 00:14:43,752
Yeah.

226
00:14:43,904 --> 00:14:45,564
Chuck. Chuck Freeman.

227
00:14:45,697 --> 00:14:47,220
But they'd been having trouble.

228
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,157
Yeah, she told me that too.

229
00:14:49,281 --> 00:14:51,078
I ran into her on the subway
last week...

230
00:14:51,201 --> 00:14:53,669
...she mentioned
that they were having fights.

231
00:14:53,761 --> 00:14:55,694
Was that the last time you saw her?

232
00:14:55,808 --> 00:14:56,900
Yeah.

233
00:14:57,056 --> 00:15:00,992
I mean, I tried to call her, but she was
in the middle of something, and...

234
00:15:01,088 --> 00:15:04,024
Well, I wish now I had tried
a little bit harder.

235
00:15:04,097 --> 00:15:05,256
Oh, I know, honey.

236
00:15:05,409 --> 00:15:08,572
They knew each other
since they were kids.

237
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,841
You were so close, you two,
especially after your father...

238
00:15:12,897 --> 00:15:14,592
Yeah, I know.

239
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,283
Well, you were always so good to me
and my mother.

240
00:15:18,337 --> 00:15:19,304
So was Grace.

241
00:15:23,425 --> 00:15:26,723
Mrs. Clayton, we're gonna need you
to sign some papers downstairs.

242
00:15:26,785 --> 00:15:28,047
Certainly.

243
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:30,093
I'll be just a minute.

244
00:15:31,777 --> 00:15:33,370
Ro.

245
00:15:34,177 --> 00:15:37,409
You know, Grace was so proud
of you.

246
00:15:37,730 --> 00:15:41,221
She saved all your articles.
She bragged about you.

247
00:15:41,793 --> 00:15:44,353
How did she know
that I was David Shane?

248
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:46,883
I assumed you told her.

249
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:51,458
I probably did.

250
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,585
Thank you.

251
00:15:53,728 --> 00:15:57,165
The police are gonna find out
exactly who did this.

252
00:15:57,762 --> 00:15:59,854
I'll make sure they do.

253
00:16:00,546 --> 00:16:02,342
Thank you, honey.

254
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:09,433
Hey.

255
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:11,844
Hey, Miles.

256
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,663
Let me get the key.

257
00:16:15,778 --> 00:16:19,009
I'm usually a key-above-the-door
kind of guy.

258
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:23,036
- Hey, Miles.
- Yeah.

259
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:26,162
When was the last time
you saw Grace?

260
00:16:28,323 --> 00:16:30,813
Oh, God, you know me
and dates, l- -

261
00:16:30,915 --> 00:16:32,779
All right, well, roughly. A week?

262
00:16:32,899 --> 00:16:35,834
A month? A year?
Five years? What?

263
00:16:35,907 --> 00:16:38,204
Yeah, something like that. Why?

264
00:16:38,786 --> 00:16:40,219
Because.

265
00:16:40,354 --> 00:16:42,949
Just because I cut somebody out
of my life...

266
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:46,274
...doesn't mean I expect you
to cut them out of yours.

267
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:49,536
- Well, maybe you do.
- All right, maybe I do.

268
00:16:49,987 --> 00:16:52,614
- Why you got to keep it a secret?
- We exchanged e-mails...

269
00:16:52,707 --> 00:16:56,302
...a couple times. I was only nice to
her because she was a friend of yours.

270
00:16:56,354 --> 00:16:58,448
So you told her I was David Shane?

271
00:16:59,427 --> 00:17:01,657
Yeah. Busted.

272
00:17:01,763 --> 00:17:04,197
Could you be serious for five
fucking minutes?

273
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:07,385
I'll bet you told her
about Senator Sachs too, didn't you?

274
00:17:07,458 --> 00:17:10,189
I stopped associating with her
when she fucked your boyfriend.

275
00:17:10,276 --> 00:17:11,242
Ask him who told her.

276
00:17:11,394 --> 00:17:14,489
You need to stay in your own
fucking lane, that's what I think.

277
00:17:14,564 --> 00:17:17,863
You just better leave Cam out of it.
I mean it, Miles.

278
00:17:17,924 --> 00:17:20,858
Ro, I' m sorry.
I was being insensitive.

279
00:17:20,931 --> 00:17:22,899
Ro, I' m sorry.

280
00:17:23,011 --> 00:17:26,811
It's just... I was the one
who was left picking up the pieces...

281
00:17:26,852 --> 00:17:30,184
...after Grace and Cameron
tore you apart and l- - And l- -

282
00:17:33,412 --> 00:17:37,347
Yeah. So, what do the police say?

283
00:17:37,379 --> 00:17:41,214
They're chasing a lead on some guy
she was dating in Philly.

284
00:17:41,507 --> 00:17:43,441
But I have another idea.

285
00:17:43,556 --> 00:17:44,682
Why's that?

286
00:17:45,347 --> 00:17:47,611
Because I saw Grace last week.

287
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,611
Oh, I' m the one
who's keeping secrets?

288
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:55,038
She wanted me to chase down
Harrison Hill.

289
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,573
Harrison Hill, Harrison Hill?

290
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,075
Yes, that Harrison Hill.
Here, take a look at this.

291
00:17:59,172 --> 00:18:01,038
She was threatening
to go to his wife.

292
00:18:01,157 --> 00:18:02,784
Apparently, they met online
in July...

293
00:18:02,917 --> 00:18:05,510
...and had one hell of a weekend
in September.

294
00:18:05,604 --> 00:18:07,697
I mean, that's assuming
he is ADEX.

295
00:18:07,813 --> 00:18:08,802
- Wait. Who? Who?
- ADEX.

296
00:18:08,964 --> 00:18:11,297
The guy she's been e-mailing,
ADEX.

297
00:18:11,397 --> 00:18:13,661
I mean, it tracks.
Harrison Hill owns...

298
00:18:13,765 --> 00:18:17,223
...the biggest ad agency
in New York City?

299
00:18:17,283 --> 00:18:22,119
"I' m gonna fuck you so hard,
I'm gonna split you in half."

300
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,669
Oh, my.

301
00:18:27,301 --> 00:18:29,030
Oh, my God.

302
00:18:32,165 --> 00:18:34,929
Wait a minute, Ro.
This is not a story.

303
00:18:35,013 --> 00:18:40,109
Miles, I would love, love, love to get
my hands on the rest of these e-mails.

304
00:18:40,101 --> 00:18:43,434
Because the way I see it, Grace was
fucking Hill, he dumped her...

305
00:18:43,494 --> 00:18:46,690
...she got pissed, threatened to go
to the wife, and she wound up dead.

306
00:18:46,758 --> 00:18:47,883
I mean, come on.

307
00:18:48,037 --> 00:18:50,130
- It 's simple, that's it.
- This is Harrison Hill.

308
00:18:50,245 --> 00:18:52,406
If he wanted somebody dead,
he won't do it hims...

309
00:18:52,517 --> 00:18:55,510
- That's just the first of all.
- She was stalking the guy.

310
00:18:55,588 --> 00:18:59,149
She sent him a million e-mails.
She probably even went to his house.

311
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:00,537
Who knows?

312
00:19:00,678 --> 00:19:04,044
All it takes to commit a murder...

313
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:07,764
...are the right ingredients
at the right time.

314
00:19:11,494 --> 00:19:13,792
Son of a bitch.

315
00:19:15,462 --> 00:19:17,293
- Hey, where are you?
- G.W. Bridge.

316
00:19:17,412 --> 00:19:18,880
Why? What's up?

317
00:19:19,014 --> 00:19:21,710
I got into Grace's Hotmail account.
It's her main one.

318
00:19:21,798 --> 00:19:23,992
There's a shitload of guys in there,
by the way.

319
00:19:24,101 --> 00:19:25,593
But none of them are ADEX.

320
00:19:25,734 --> 00:19:27,726
But that's not the account
I gave you, Miles.

321
00:19:27,846 --> 00:19:32,010
Well, hold on. And then I looked at her
other account, FastFilly @iol.com...

322
00:19:32,037 --> 00:19:35,735
...and guess who's all up in her box?
ADEX. Ro.

323
00:19:36,103 --> 00:19:38,502
- Yeah?
- You got to read some of this shit.

324
00:19:38,598 --> 00:19:40,157
I wanna read it all, Miles.

325
00:19:40,295 --> 00:19:42,855
Okay. So, I' m gonna bring over
everything after work.

326
00:19:42,951 --> 00:19:45,783
And, Ro, we still don't know
that ADEX is Hill.

327
00:19:45,861 --> 00:19:48,159
And we still don't know
that he's not.

328
00:19:48,485 --> 00:19:49,453
Yeah.

329
00:20:26,663 --> 00:20:29,326
Hey, your dinner's getting warm.

330
00:20:36,007 --> 00:20:37,372
Hold it.

331
00:20:37,896 --> 00:20:41,662
Can I just say for the record, wow.

332
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,057
Can I also say that's just a ridiculous
outfit to be wearing for takeout?

333
00:20:48,104 --> 00:20:50,072
Well, I didn't know
you were bringing takeout.

334
00:20:50,184 --> 00:20:52,276
Well, I didn't know you had a date.

335
00:20:52,455 --> 00:20:55,220
- Oh, God.
- Who's the?

336
00:20:55,304 --> 00:20:57,499
Who's the lucky guy?

337
00:20:58,280 --> 00:21:00,510
Can we just look at the e-mails,
please?

338
00:21:00,616 --> 00:21:02,709
Sure. Yeah. Here, here.
Have a seat.

339
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,799
Okay.

340
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,380
So yeah.

341
00:21:10,728 --> 00:21:15,290
You told me that Grace wanted you
to threaten Hill.

342
00:21:15,303 --> 00:21:19,034
Well, she was doing it without you
for a while. Listen. This, this...

343
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,243
This e-mail' s a week old
and it's her last one.

344
00:21:22,312 --> 00:21:24,837
"Harrison, if you don't," capital,
"pay attention to me...

345
00:21:24,937 --> 00:21:27,200
...you're going to," capital,
"pay the price.

346
00:21:27,305 --> 00:21:29,932
I'm in the city
and I know your wife's away.

347
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:33,392
Meet with me now,
or I' II meet with her later."

348
00:21:33,448 --> 00:21:36,815
So Grace knew that the wife
was out of town.

349
00:21:36,873 --> 00:21:39,534
You're going under the assumption
that Grace actually knew...

350
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,820
...what she was talking about,
which is a mistake.

351
00:21:41,928 --> 00:21:44,123
By the way, even though she calls
ADEX Harrison...

352
00:21:44,233 --> 00:21:47,565
...it doesn't prove that it's Harrison
Hill. It 's not proof enough to print.

353
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:49,650
Okay. So how do we prove it?

354
00:21:49,769 --> 00:21:51,464
Well, technically we can't prove it...

355
00:21:51,593 --> 00:21:53,788
...but if we can get ADEX
to send us an e-mail...

356
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:57,889
...I can tail it, jimmy the lock, and then
take a closer look into his account.

357
00:21:59,048 --> 00:22:01,642
You are amazing.

358
00:22:02,665 --> 00:22:04,725
Ilove you, man.

359
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:07,893
This is just such an obstruction
of justice.

360
00:22:07,978 --> 00:22:10,879
No, no, no.
This is the pursuit of justice.

361
00:22:10,954 --> 00:22:13,615
I'll make you a deal.
We get anything concrete on Hill...

362
00:22:13,705 --> 00:22:16,265
...we'll go to the cops
and to Narron on the same day.

363
00:22:16,362 --> 00:22:18,227
They get their man.
We get our story.

364
00:22:18,345 --> 00:22:20,041
But even if ADEX turns out
to be Hill...

365
00:22:20,169 --> 00:22:22,467
...it's not a crime to chat nor cheat.

366
00:22:22,570 --> 00:22:25,970
But it is a crime to be walking out
on a feast like this in that outfit.

367
00:22:26,025 --> 00:22:28,050
And yet, I have to because I' m late.

368
00:22:28,168 --> 00:22:30,364
So you finish up.
I'll see you tomorrow.

369
00:22:30,473 --> 00:22:32,703
Shut the door. It locks by itself.

370
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,538
Have fun.

371
00:22:41,608 --> 00:22:43,201
Harrison Hill.

372
00:22:47,082 --> 00:22:48,276
Oh, there you are.

373
00:23:00,331 --> 00:23:01,923
Cam.

374
00:23:02,058 --> 00:23:03,081
- Oh, Cam.
- Come here.

375
00:23:03,243 --> 00:23:05,643
- You are naughty.
- Come on.

376
00:23:11,562 --> 00:23:13,028
Come here.

377
00:23:15,467 --> 00:23:17,525
Oh, yeah.

378
00:23:18,603 --> 00:23:19,969
Yeah.

379
00:23:33,706 --> 00:23:35,732
- You like that?
- Yes, baby.

380
00:23:35,852 --> 00:23:38,446
Oh, come on. Say it.

381
00:23:42,859 --> 00:23:45,488
Yeah, oh, yeah.

382
00:23:45,578 --> 00:23:47,547
You like it? You like that?

383
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,026
Yeah, good.

384
00:23:55,275 --> 00:23:56,571
I need to get closer to Hill.

385
00:23:56,716 --> 00:23:59,742
Hello, Miles. How are you?
Fine. You? Thanks.

386
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:01,548
Hello, Miles. How are you?
Fine. You?

387
00:24:01,675 --> 00:24:03,337
Okay, I need to get closer to Hill.

388
00:24:03,467 --> 00:24:05,094
Close as you got to Cam last night?

389
00:24:05,228 --> 00:24:07,855
It's a little soon to be going
on dates with Grace's ex.

390
00:24:07,947 --> 00:24:09,312
Oh, I' m sorry, your ex.

391
00:24:09,451 --> 00:24:10,885
Are you fucking spying on me now?

392
00:24:11,308 --> 00:24:13,208
No. A friend of mine saw you
two last night.

393
00:24:13,324 --> 00:24:14,689
And he said it looked friendly.

394
00:24:14,827 --> 00:24:16,260
What? You get him by default?

395
00:24:16,395 --> 00:24:19,762
Well, not that I owe you or
your friend an explanation.

396
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:22,345
I wanted to see Cam. Somebody
had to tell him about Grace.

397
00:24:22,443 --> 00:24:24,638
Well, I guess we all
grieve differently.

398
00:24:24,748 --> 00:24:27,274
You know what, Miles? Forget it.

399
00:24:27,372 --> 00:24:29,499
If you don't wanna help me,
Terry wouldn't mind.

400
00:24:29,612 --> 00:24:31,171
He's been dying to get
into research.

401
00:24:31,308 --> 00:24:34,038
Oh, Terry couldn't find his ass
with both hands and his ass.

402
00:24:35,053 --> 00:24:37,146
All right, fine, fine, fine.
I'll play nice.

403
00:24:38,027 --> 00:24:39,256
Okay. Good.

404
00:24:39,884 --> 00:24:41,613
While you look around
in cyberspace...

405
00:24:41,741 --> 00:24:43,936
...I need to be looking around
at my new job...

406
00:24:44,043 --> 00:24:46,239
...that you, clever friend,
are going to get me.

407
00:24:46,348 --> 00:24:48,043
Oh, God love you.

408
00:24:48,172 --> 00:24:50,834
Something temporary.
Easy in, easy out. Can you do that?

409
00:24:50,925 --> 00:24:53,449
Does a bear shit in the woods?
H2A's got a blade server...

410
00:24:53,548 --> 00:24:56,541
...that gives more entry points
than a college girl at Mardi Gras.

411
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:59,111
I'll access the needs list they send
to temp agencies.

412
00:24:59,213 --> 00:25:01,272
Shouldn't be too hard.
There's always openings.

413
00:25:01,389 --> 00:25:04,017
- And, hey, wear something sexy.
- What?

414
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:05,236
You need to bait the hook.

415
00:25:05,773 --> 00:25:08,468
Just make sure I' m working for Hill.

416
00:25:08,556 --> 00:25:10,583
Yeah, your new name
will be Katherine Pogue.

417
00:25:10,701 --> 00:25:12,395
I choose my own names.

418
00:25:12,525 --> 00:25:15,584
Well, tough. I had a crush on a girl
in high school named Katherine.

419
00:25:15,661 --> 00:25:17,094
It's an homage.

420
00:25:17,229 --> 00:25:19,720
- Going to H2A.
- H2A.

421
00:25:19,853 --> 00:25:23,185
Hill 's a Jersey native who slipped
and fell into a big pile of money...

422
00:25:23,245 --> 00:25:26,180
...when he married...
- Mia Rheinhart Hill.

423
00:25:26,254 --> 00:25:29,621
She's also the daughter of Max
Rheinhart, principal owner of H2A.

424
00:25:29,677 --> 00:25:30,906
- There you go.
- Thank you.

425
00:25:31,054 --> 00:25:33,249
Now, if you'll follow me.

426
00:25:34,734 --> 00:25:37,567
Hard to separate a man
from his wife's money.

427
00:25:37,645 --> 00:25:39,705
Money is the root of all evil, Miles.

428
00:25:40,557 --> 00:25:42,355
Check your scriptures.

429
00:25:42,478 --> 00:25:45,275
Love of money is the root of all evil,
Ro.

430
00:25:45,646 --> 00:25:47,012
Love.

431
00:25:47,949 --> 00:25:50,713
We have a new temp.
Her name is Katherine Pogue.

432
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:52,060
- Hi.
- Hi.

433
00:25:52,397 --> 00:25:54,126
Thank you. I' II show you
to your desk.

434
00:25:54,509 --> 00:25:56,204
And press 9 to get out,
3 to reach me.

435
00:25:56,333 --> 00:25:59,769
I'll be right across from you. You
shouldn't have a problem finding me.

436
00:26:05,806 --> 00:26:08,275
Katherine, we need a coffee setup
in Conference Room A.

437
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:10,129
- Will I be working for Mr. Hill?
- No.

438
00:26:10,255 --> 00:26:12,621
I'm working for Mr. Hill.
You're working for me.

439
00:26:12,718 --> 00:26:16,552
And you'd better roll up your sleeves.
We are short-staffed this week.

440
00:26:20,814 --> 00:26:23,784
Sensational, Harrison. Really.

441
00:26:23,854 --> 00:26:25,152
Spectacular.

442
00:26:25,294 --> 00:26:29,163
I hear you're thinking about opening
in Amsterdam, by the way.

443
00:26:29,199 --> 00:26:32,692
- Yes, we did. In April.
- Really?

444
00:26:32,752 --> 00:26:33,740
Excuse me, Mr. Hill.

445
00:26:33,902 --> 00:26:36,770
Mr. Kirschenbaum's car is downstairs
and your 2:00 is waiting.

446
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:38,781
Thanks, Esmeralda.

447
00:26:39,086 --> 00:26:41,350
- I' II walk you out, Jon.
- Great. Thanks.

448
00:26:41,455 --> 00:26:44,720
You're doing well.
I'm very proud of you.

449
00:26:45,135 --> 00:26:47,830
I couldn't have done it without you.
Ilearned from the best.

450
00:26:47,918 --> 00:26:49,648
- I appreciate it.
- Thanks for coming by.

451
00:26:49,775 --> 00:26:51,902
Listen, this is probably
just bullshit...

452
00:26:52,015 --> 00:26:56,281
...but one of my guys heard that a
couple of your execs were in Canton...

453
00:26:56,303 --> 00:26:58,464
...sniffing around
my Reebok account.

454
00:26:58,608 --> 00:27:00,974
If you're sure it's bullshit,
why are you asking me?

455
00:27:01,296 --> 00:27:04,527
Because they heard about it
from inside your agency.

456
00:27:05,103 --> 00:27:08,096
I just don't want you to make that kind
of mistake, Harrison.

457
00:27:08,174 --> 00:27:11,042
I've been representing Reebok
for 11 years.

458
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,210
They're my main account.

459
00:27:12,367 --> 00:27:16,668
They're not gonna jump ship for your
smile and some downtown hype.

460
00:27:19,792 --> 00:27:23,558
Eat or be eaten. Right, Jon?

461
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:25,464
Isn't that what you always told me?

462
00:27:25,583 --> 00:27:27,950
Now, you left the Reebok account out
on the table.

463
00:27:28,048 --> 00:27:31,778
If I didn't pick it up, someone else
was going to and you know that.

464
00:27:31,823 --> 00:27:35,419
Ten years ago you wouldn't have let
this happen. You fumbled the ball.

465
00:27:35,471 --> 00:27:38,201
You really are that stupid.

466
00:27:38,287 --> 00:27:40,722
Give my regards to Vanessa.

467
00:27:43,185 --> 00:27:44,776
Esmeralda.

468
00:27:51,056 --> 00:27:54,025
We have a leak to
Kirschenbaum and Bond.

469
00:27:54,097 --> 00:27:57,829
I wanna find out who the fuck it is.
Right now.

470
00:27:59,696 --> 00:28:01,357
Hold the door, please.

471
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,161
- Wait. Thank you.
- That was close.

472
00:28:10,193 --> 00:28:13,252
Harrison, will you be attending
the Victoria's Secret meeting tonight?

473
00:28:13,329 --> 00:28:15,522
I was hoping maybe I could catch
a ride.

474
00:28:15,632 --> 00:28:17,930
- Yeah, I think I' II be going.
- Okay.

475
00:28:40,465 --> 00:28:42,366
Keep the meter running.

476
00:29:04,305 --> 00:29:06,740
We can go now.
74th and Broadway, please.

477
00:29:24,627 --> 00:29:26,321
Rowena.

478
00:29:29,138 --> 00:29:30,800
Rowena.

479
00:29:33,458 --> 00:29:36,019
Rowena.

480
00:29:38,515 --> 00:29:40,380
Got you.

481
00:29:46,962 --> 00:29:50,126
You know how much
Daddy likes bath time.

482
00:30:01,586 --> 00:30:03,680
We have a Victoria's Secret
party tonight.

483
00:30:03,795 --> 00:30:06,992
- Good morning, Esmeralda.
- Good morning, Katherine.

484
00:30:07,059 --> 00:30:10,894
Two hundred guests,
200 gift bags, too little time.

485
00:30:10,932 --> 00:30:14,388
Five items per bag. Have fun.

486
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:28,360
- Miles, what? I'm at work.
- Well, it wasn't just a drowning.

487
00:30:28,818 --> 00:30:30,310
She was poisoned.

488
00:30:30,451 --> 00:30:32,681
She had a hole in her gut the size
of a fruit bowl.

489
00:30:32,788 --> 00:30:34,449
Oh, come on.

490
00:30:34,579 --> 00:30:37,174
No, that's a direct quote
from the examiner's office.

491
00:30:37,268 --> 00:30:39,292
The killer also put it in her eyes...

492
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,919
...which is weird.

493
00:30:42,931 --> 00:30:45,901
Ro, they haven't announced it yet...

494
00:30:46,516 --> 00:30:47,846
...but Grace was pregnant.

495
00:30:48,757 --> 00:30:51,280
She was in her first trimester.

496
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:53,906
Hello. I' m Gina.

497
00:30:54,004 --> 00:30:56,973
- Ro?
- Katherine Pogue, are you in here?

498
00:30:57,044 --> 00:30:59,103
Oh, there you are.

499
00:30:59,988 --> 00:31:03,014
I could tell you Victoria's secret,
but then I' d have to kill you.

500
00:31:03,092 --> 00:31:04,059
- Clever, huh?
- Yeah.

501
00:31:04,213 --> 00:31:07,079
Mr. Hill came up with it for the
"Very Sexy Collection" launch.

502
00:31:08,053 --> 00:31:09,486
Very sexy.

503
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:11,416
And in a rainbow of colors.

504
00:31:12,596 --> 00:31:14,460
Here, keep a few for the home fires.

505
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,640
I know a pretty girl like you
has a boyfriend.

506
00:31:16,757 --> 00:31:18,918
- No.
- Girlfriend?

507
00:31:20,148 --> 00:31:21,912
- Pets?
- No.

508
00:31:22,037 --> 00:31:25,005
Well, we've got some
local talent here.

509
00:31:25,076 --> 00:31:29,309
I'll say. What's up with Hill?
He's interesting.

510
00:31:29,717 --> 00:31:30,774
Married.

511
00:31:31,412 --> 00:31:34,348
Rumor is, and you didn't hear it
from me...

512
00:31:34,421 --> 00:31:38,221
...he had a couple of interoffice flings
a few years back, led to lawsuits.

513
00:31:38,261 --> 00:31:40,728
Paid a lot of money
to make them go away.

514
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:43,756
That's when he got his front girl
to run interference.

515
00:31:43,829 --> 00:31:45,194
That would be Josie.

516
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:49,436
Or, if you get on her bad side,
Cujosie.

517
00:31:49,493 --> 00:31:52,053
She's his gatekeeper.
His walking hard drive.

518
00:31:52,149 --> 00:31:55,516
So he never forgets a name,
an account, an enemy.

519
00:31:55,573 --> 00:31:57,939
No one gets to him now
without going through her.

520
00:31:58,038 --> 00:32:00,198
Let me guess, he's done her too,
right?

521
00:32:00,310 --> 00:32:02,777
Oh, no. No.

522
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:06,397
She'd be more interested in you than
in him, if you catch my heavy drift.

523
00:32:06,998 --> 00:32:08,396
I think I do.

524
00:32:08,533 --> 00:32:10,900
She's his watchdog, not his bitch.

525
00:32:10,997 --> 00:32:14,125
- The guy's reformed, unfortunately.
- Right.

526
00:32:14,646 --> 00:32:16,546
His wife's all over him.

527
00:32:16,662 --> 00:32:18,596
She's got eyes in the back
of your head.

528
00:32:18,709 --> 00:32:19,677
Trust me.

529
00:32:19,829 --> 00:32:25,258
She finds him cheating,
she and her money are out the door.

530
00:32:25,334 --> 00:32:26,732
See Jesse Drake over there?

531
00:32:26,869 --> 00:32:29,737
He had this blond temp last fall
could melt butter.

532
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:32,544
Her name was Veronica.

533
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:34,598
One day, the boss's wife comes in...

534
00:32:34,710 --> 00:32:37,702
...sees Mr. H and Veronica talking
close over the Sparkletts...

535
00:32:37,782 --> 00:32:40,580
...the next day the temp's toast.

536
00:32:40,662 --> 00:32:42,790
The boy's been leashed.

537
00:32:42,903 --> 00:32:46,338
But since I have it on good authority
he's into some very kinky shit.

538
00:32:46,391 --> 00:32:48,654
He probably likes the tight collar.

539
00:32:50,423 --> 00:32:52,390
I'd let him give me a little spank.

540
00:32:53,238 --> 00:32:55,901
- Did I just say that out loud?
- You're sick.

541
00:33:05,367 --> 00:33:06,799
Sorry.

542
00:33:07,767 --> 00:33:08,995
I didn't mean to scare you.

543
00:33:09,142 --> 00:33:10,508
Sorry.

544
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:13,820
You're Katherine, right?

545
00:33:13,943 --> 00:33:16,935
And you're Harrison Hill, the boss.

546
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:18,890
Yes.

547
00:33:19,863 --> 00:33:21,421
It's good to be the boss.

548
00:33:21,847 --> 00:33:23,279
Yeah.

549
00:33:23,863 --> 00:33:27,355
So I' II see you at the party tonight,
Katherine.

550
00:33:58,136 --> 00:33:59,865
Here we go.

551
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:11,014
On behalf of Victoria's Secret, I would
like to thank our very special angel...

552
00:34:11,032 --> 00:34:14,662
...Harrison Hill, for making us
sexier than ever.

553
00:34:16,408 --> 00:34:17,876
Harrison.

554
00:34:21,815 --> 00:34:24,045
I have no idea how we could
possibly make...

555
00:34:24,152 --> 00:34:26,314
...you look any sexier than you do
tonight, Heidi.

556
00:34:26,425 --> 00:34:28,585
Thank you so very much.

557
00:34:28,697 --> 00:34:33,134
I'd just like to raise a glass
to everyone at Victoria's Secret...

558
00:34:33,145 --> 00:34:35,612
...and all my people at H2A...

559
00:34:35,704 --> 00:34:37,672
...for making this
a successful campaign...

560
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:42,484
...a Very Sexy Collection
is H2A's most sexful- -

561
00:34:43,705 --> 00:34:45,969
Succsexf...

562
00:34:48,825 --> 00:34:50,486
We did really good
with this campaign.

563
00:34:50,617 --> 00:34:53,449
Happy Valentine's Day.
God bless you.

564
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,638
Thank you. Good night.

565
00:34:58,265 --> 00:35:01,393
So is part of the torture the fact
we get to watch all this fun?

566
00:35:01,464 --> 00:35:03,864
Are you kidding me?
We got the best seats in the house.

567
00:35:03,961 --> 00:35:07,419
Okay, see the guy with the bad
combover standing by the statues?

568
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:09,539
Bob Milstein, Accounting.

569
00:35:09,657 --> 00:35:11,318
He may look unlucky in love.

570
00:35:11,450 --> 00:35:14,476
He recently nailed Kay Rolands,
Sales...

571
00:35:14,553 --> 00:35:17,076
...the giant standing by the shrimp.

572
00:35:17,561 --> 00:35:21,429
- Corporate America, ain't it grand?
- One big happy family, eh?

573
00:35:21,465 --> 00:35:24,697
Who's the loud-laughing brunette?
The one that looks a little tipsy.

574
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:29,199
Oh, Bethany Lee, account manager.

575
00:35:29,209 --> 00:35:32,804
Long legs, perfect teeth,
may they rot in hell.

576
00:35:33,977 --> 00:35:35,638
A few years back
there was chatter...

577
00:35:35,769 --> 00:35:39,671
...she and Mr. Hill were going over
more than just the company numbers.

578
00:35:39,706 --> 00:35:40,764
- Really?
- Yeah.

579
00:35:40,922 --> 00:35:43,720
But that was before the lawsuits,
before Cujosie...

580
00:35:43,803 --> 00:35:46,531
...and before the wife
started paying attention.

581
00:35:46,617 --> 00:35:50,076
Now it's all hugs and kisses
and they're going to fertility clinics.

582
00:35:50,138 --> 00:35:51,901
I think her oven's on the fritz.

583
00:35:52,666 --> 00:35:54,964
Is there anything you don't know,
Gina?

584
00:35:55,067 --> 00:35:56,556
No.

585
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:59,654
I don't get it. Mrs. Hill is pretty.

586
00:35:59,738 --> 00:36:01,365
I mean, she's really pretty.

587
00:36:01,496 --> 00:36:06,401
Show me a beautiful woman, I' II show
you a man who's tired of fucking her.

588
00:36:06,393 --> 00:36:09,261
- Nice, Gina.
- What? I' ve got brothers.

589
00:36:14,811 --> 00:36:16,710
Hi.

590
00:36:16,826 --> 00:36:18,521
Hey.

591
00:36:21,049 --> 00:36:23,211
You're embarrassing him
and yourself.

592
00:36:23,321 --> 00:36:25,449
Okay, I' II be better.

593
00:36:25,563 --> 00:36:28,964
His wife is out there.

594
00:36:29,019 --> 00:36:30,610
I'm sorry.

595
00:36:30,746 --> 00:36:32,441
I'm sorry.

596
00:36:32,634 --> 00:36:34,830
Here's money for a cab.

597
00:36:35,450 --> 00:36:36,940
Come on.

598
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:41,691
- He'll call me, right?
- Good night, Bethany, good night.

599
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:58,769
I told you already, Narron, I quit.

600
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:01,868
I figured two weeks was enough
to let you cool off.

601
00:37:01,947 --> 00:37:03,710
I gotta go.

602
00:37:04,827 --> 00:37:07,296
I'm sorry about the senator, Ro,
but I can't lose you.

603
00:37:07,386 --> 00:37:10,379
- David Shane is this paper's star.
- You don't bench a star, Narron.

604
00:37:10,459 --> 00:37:13,359
There will always be powerful people
covering things up, Ro...

605
00:37:13,436 --> 00:37:15,404
...at every paper, in every city.

606
00:37:15,515 --> 00:37:17,779
It's called editorializing
and it's a reality.

607
00:37:18,491 --> 00:37:20,323
Don't give up
because one son of a bitch...

608
00:37:20,444 --> 00:37:23,243
...pulled some strings at the paper
and silenced your source.

609
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:26,453
Rest up, come back...

610
00:37:26,525 --> 00:37:29,084
...and nail the next son of a bitch.

611
00:37:31,196 --> 00:37:32,527
Maybe.

612
00:37:32,668 --> 00:37:35,797
So I set up your IOL account,
but you're gonna need a name.

613
00:37:36,317 --> 00:37:38,376
How about Rocket?

614
00:37:38,493 --> 00:37:40,859
That was my nickname
from college.

615
00:37:40,957 --> 00:37:43,926
Are you sure you don't wanna be
"Hot Bitch on Wheels"?

616
00:37:44,667 --> 00:37:50,268
No, I' m kidding.
All right, Rocket, Rocket, "Rocketgirl."

617
00:37:50,332 --> 00:37:54,234
Alittle sexier than
DShane@NYCourier.com.

618
00:37:54,269 --> 00:37:56,499
So I put ADEX...

619
00:37:58,045 --> 00:38:02,675
...into your friends file
and as a little extra added bonus...

620
00:38:02,685 --> 00:38:06,246
...your computer has a few things
to say. Listen, this is good.

621
00:38:07,229 --> 00:38:08,662
Miles is sexy.

622
00:38:10,686 --> 00:38:12,209
Miles is sexy.

623
00:38:13,724 --> 00:38:15,588
- Translation?
- Let me guess.

624
00:38:15,709 --> 00:38:16,835
Miles is sexy?

625
00:38:16,989 --> 00:38:20,426
- You think so?
- And I need this, why?

626
00:38:20,477 --> 00:38:21,910
Because it's fucking radical.

627
00:38:22,045 --> 00:38:24,446
Every time you get an IM,
you'll have a voice to match.

628
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:27,065
I don't want my computer talking.
I don't want it saying:

629
00:38:27,165 --> 00:38:29,758
- "Miles is sexy."
- I' II just give an audio to Hill.

630
00:38:29,852 --> 00:38:32,014
I sampled his voice
from some streaming video.

631
00:38:32,124 --> 00:38:34,525
- You don't mind if Hill talks?
- Do I have a choice?

632
00:38:34,622 --> 00:38:36,249
No.

633
00:38:40,382 --> 00:38:42,179
So, what's he like up close
and personal

634
00:38:42,301 --> 00:38:46,363
Well, tell you one thing,
there's more to the guy than you think.

635
00:38:46,398 --> 00:38:47,921
You should check out his offices.

636
00:38:48,062 --> 00:38:49,324
Go online, take the tour.

637
00:38:49,470 --> 00:38:52,064
You'll see. It 's outrageous.

638
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:55,756
Sick. Just what you'd like.

639
00:38:55,837 --> 00:38:59,740
Oh, you know what, by the way,
I did find something out. Apparently...

640
00:38:59,773 --> 00:39:03,232
...Hill has squashed a couple
of sexual harassment suits.

641
00:39:03,294 --> 00:39:05,386
- Could you chase the money trail
- Yeah, well...

642
00:39:05,503 --> 00:39:07,528
...I guess he's a likely
candidate for that.

643
00:39:07,646 --> 00:39:08,704
No, not really.

644
00:39:08,862 --> 00:39:10,988
He's now got this gorgeous
Amazonian woman...

645
00:39:11,102 --> 00:39:14,503
...that does all the dirty work.
- Oh, really? Is she hot?

646
00:39:14,557 --> 00:39:15,820
Yes.

647
00:39:15,967 --> 00:39:20,631
She's very hot.
She's also a lesbian.

648
00:39:20,639 --> 00:39:22,334
Bastard.

649
00:39:23,231 --> 00:39:26,132
All right, so seeing
that you're a chat-room virgin...

650
00:39:26,207 --> 00:39:29,107
- Big deal, I' m a chat-room virgin.
- No, I think it's a compliment.

651
00:39:29,182 --> 00:39:32,242
I think you should practice
online flirting.

652
00:39:32,510 --> 00:39:36,174
- Why would I want to do that?
- Because you'll tell a perfect stranger...

653
00:39:36,223 --> 00:39:39,817
...something you won't tell your best
friend. Especially if you're anonymous.

654
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:42,236
You should know that,
Mr. David Shane.

655
00:39:43,999 --> 00:39:46,867
Oh, by the way, I got a dollar that
says Hill 's not our guy.

656
00:39:48,351 --> 00:39:52,083
We got a pregnant Grace,
threatening to go to the wife, right?

657
00:39:52,127 --> 00:39:56,029
- Yeah.
- Okay, but meanwhile, the wife...

658
00:39:56,062 --> 00:39:59,294
...is busy trying to haul Hill off
to a fertility clinic.

659
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:04,915
And let's not forget the most
important part, the wife is the money.

660
00:40:04,928 --> 00:40:06,293
- Yeah.
- I don't know.

661
00:40:06,432 --> 00:40:07,730
That's motive on a big stick.

662
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:10,635
- Motive on a big stick?
- That's what I said.

663
00:40:10,719 --> 00:40:13,813
So I' II take your bet.

664
00:40:13,888 --> 00:40:15,514
Game on.

665
00:40:18,304 --> 00:40:20,204
Welcome to chat.

666
00:40:21,184 --> 00:40:23,151
"Trublu?" Okay.

667
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:26,197
Welcome.

668
00:40:26,688 --> 00:40:28,246
"Haven't seen you around."

669
00:40:29,535 --> 00:40:32,732
New to this. Who are you?

670
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:38,135
Hello, Neil, I' m Tiffany.

671
00:40:44,128 --> 00:40:47,724
Okay, Trublu, let's go.

672
00:40:48,608 --> 00:40:52,976
How do you imagine me?

673
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:55,391
"Long blond hair, longer legs..."

674
00:40:55,488 --> 00:40:57,821
Really close.

675
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:00,891
Welcome.

676
00:41:01,184 --> 00:41:05,211
"When you said you were getting off,
I didn't know you meant literally."

677
00:41:05,250 --> 00:41:08,116
Leave me alone.

678
00:41:11,712 --> 00:41:15,615
I haven't contacted him.

679
00:41:18,145 --> 00:41:20,340
"I did on his..."

680
00:41:28,512 --> 00:41:30,674
- Hello.
- Okay, look, this isn't funny.

681
00:41:30,785 --> 00:41:33,981
- You're taking advantage of me.
- This is exactly what we talked about.

682
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:35,846
Once he responds,
I get past his firewall.

683
00:41:35,969 --> 00:41:38,370
It's the price of admission.
I wrote, "Dear Harrison...

684
00:41:38,464 --> 00:41:41,262
...the answers are: Great sex,
cheap beer, the Rolling Stones."

685
00:41:41,345 --> 00:41:42,778
- What?
- Come on.

686
00:41:42,913 --> 00:41:46,144
We got to push his buttons. By the
way, I sent it from your account.

687
00:41:46,209 --> 00:41:48,177
Oh, shit. He's on.

688
00:41:48,290 --> 00:41:50,690
- There he is. Let me drive.
- He's on, Miles, he's on.

689
00:41:50,784 --> 00:41:53,014
- Wait. Wait, wait, wait. Miles.
- Harrison...

690
00:41:53,121 --> 00:41:55,282
- What are you doing?
- Nice to hear from you.

691
00:41:55,393 --> 00:41:58,453
Miles, you're typing for me?

692
00:41:58,530 --> 00:42:00,430
- It 's a riddle.
- Miles. Stop it.

693
00:42:00,546 --> 00:42:02,776
- Miles, stop it.
- All right, fine. Fine. Fine.

694
00:42:02,882 --> 00:42:05,542
I'm through the firewall into ADEX's
account. He's all yours.

695
00:42:06,305 --> 00:42:08,865
Miles, you bastard.

696
00:42:10,145 --> 00:42:11,578
- What's your name?
- Shit.

697
00:42:19,649 --> 00:42:20,877
Veronica.

698
00:42:21,857 --> 00:42:23,620
What color is your hair?

699
00:42:24,353 --> 00:42:26,049
Blond.

700
00:42:27,041 --> 00:42:28,031
Dirty.

701
00:42:28,962 --> 00:42:31,123
I like dirty.

702
00:42:31,747 --> 00:42:33,338
Filthy.

703
00:42:33,474 --> 00:42:36,102
I'd like to get a fistful

704
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:37,919
Are you turned on?

705
00:42:38,114 --> 00:42:40,014
I am.

706
00:42:40,514 --> 00:42:42,106
Fucker.

707
00:42:46,147 --> 00:42:47,115
I should go.

708
00:42:47,267 --> 00:42:49,166
But you just warmed me up.

709
00:42:49,282 --> 00:42:51,251
Yeah. Don't blueball the guy.

710
00:42:51,363 --> 00:42:55,094
"Yeah, Ro. Don't blueball the guy."

711
00:42:57,828 --> 00:43:00,388
- I' II be back. Bye.
- Goodbye.

712
00:43:03,939 --> 00:43:06,101
Would you quit spying on me,
you fuck?

713
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:09,112
You are officially in the way
of how I work and I' m not having it.

714
00:43:09,187 --> 00:43:12,088
- It 's Hill. We can prove it now.
- Don't send e-mails on my behalf.

715
00:43:12,163 --> 00:43:14,256
And do not speak for me in any way.

716
00:43:14,371 --> 00:43:17,168
How about, "Thank you, Miles,
for your subversive genius"?

717
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:19,810
Thank you. Bye.

718
00:43:23,715 --> 00:43:26,548
Good morning, H2A.
May I help you?

719
00:43:26,947 --> 00:43:28,711
- Hey, good morning.
- How are you?

720
00:43:28,835 --> 00:43:30,861
Good morning, H2A.

721
00:43:37,347 --> 00:43:39,247
Hello.

722
00:43:40,099 --> 00:43:42,294
"What happened to you last night?"

723
00:43:48,804 --> 00:43:50,102
Morning.

724
00:43:50,243 --> 00:43:52,507
"Tiffany? Veronica?"

725
00:43:52,611 --> 00:43:53,578
Katherine.

726
00:43:56,644 --> 00:43:58,840
You forgot to fill out your l-9.

727
00:43:59,555 --> 00:44:00,852
Okay.

728
00:44:00,995 --> 00:44:04,227
I told Human Resources
I'd run it right back over there...

729
00:44:04,292 --> 00:44:05,588
...now.

730
00:44:06,085 --> 00:44:09,542
Okay, well, I' II just fill this out.

731
00:44:09,604 --> 00:44:12,767
- You looking for permanent work?
- Always.

732
00:44:12,837 --> 00:44:13,996
Where have you temped?

733
00:44:14,533 --> 00:44:16,091
I don't know. Got a phone book?

734
00:44:16,228 --> 00:44:17,286
Yes, I do.

735
00:44:18,212 --> 00:44:19,611
Okay.

736
00:44:20,548 --> 00:44:23,278
Zaffman, Meyer and Pearce, I.P. E...

737
00:44:23,365 --> 00:44:26,334
- I love the new building.
- Great bathrooms.

738
00:44:26,405 --> 00:44:28,339
What about Kirschenbaum
and Bond?

739
00:44:29,413 --> 00:44:30,901
Average bathrooms.

740
00:44:31,045 --> 00:44:32,604
When did you work there?

741
00:44:32,741 --> 00:44:34,538
I don't know, maybe April.

742
00:44:34,661 --> 00:44:36,992
I don't know. My life is kind of crazy.

743
00:44:37,093 --> 00:44:40,256
One day just runs into the next.

744
00:44:41,829 --> 00:44:43,660
Heineken Amsterdam
is gonna love it.

745
00:44:43,781 --> 00:44:46,476
We should start talking
about print, scheduling, tie-ins.

746
00:44:46,565 --> 00:44:48,295
It can play internationally too.

747
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:52,414
Jesse, why don't you start talking
about media buys with Chuck...

748
00:44:52,453 --> 00:44:54,819
...Toni and Steve.
I need a couple minutes.

749
00:44:54,917 --> 00:44:56,817
- I' II be right back.
- I' m glad you're happy.

750
00:44:56,933 --> 00:44:58,458
So glad you're happy.

751
00:44:58,598 --> 00:45:01,064
When do you think we could roll it
to print?

752
00:45:03,749 --> 00:45:04,875
Here, hold this, please.

753
00:45:05,029 --> 00:45:07,122
Esmeralda, hold my calls
for a few minutes.

754
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:09,900
Phelps. Mr. Phelps.

755
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:10,956
Afternoon, boys.

756
00:45:11,109 --> 00:45:14,339
Kindly do me a favor and stand up,
would you? Get out!

757
00:45:14,405 --> 00:45:16,738
Piece of shit,
you're gonna spy on me?

758
00:45:17,702 --> 00:45:20,636
Here, get the fuck up,
you piece of sh...

759
00:45:21,317 --> 00:45:22,807
You were a fucking bike messenger.

760
00:45:22,949 --> 00:45:24,473
I made you rich.

761
00:45:24,614 --> 00:45:28,015
I hope they have a job for you
over at Kirschenbaum.

762
00:45:30,437 --> 00:45:32,770
I accept your resignation.

763
00:45:35,846 --> 00:45:37,278
Gunnar.

764
00:45:37,958 --> 00:45:40,984
Congratulations.
Now clean up your new office.

765
00:45:42,533 --> 00:45:45,230
Back to work.
What are you guys looking at?

766
00:45:45,317 --> 00:45:47,843
Shit. What just happened?

767
00:45:47,943 --> 00:45:50,775
Gunnar Hope just got a promotion.

768
00:45:53,415 --> 00:45:56,214
"Veronica, how did you know
about my ADEX account?"

769
00:46:01,575 --> 00:46:04,408
I used to temp at H2A.

770
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,873
Yeah.

771
00:46:15,398 --> 00:46:18,299
My boyfriend wouldn't like that.

772
00:46:20,199 --> 00:46:21,563
Shit.

773
00:46:27,398 --> 00:46:29,525
Does this phone call mean
I'm forgiven?

774
00:46:29,639 --> 00:46:31,766
You've got once chance
to redeem yourself.

775
00:46:31,878 --> 00:46:33,814
He wants a photo of Veronica.

776
00:46:33,927 --> 00:46:36,794
- Who?
- Me. Rocketgirl.

777
00:46:36,871 --> 00:46:38,930
- Is nude an option?
- Miles.

778
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:41,470
There was a temp
that used to work here.

779
00:46:41,575 --> 00:46:43,475
- Veronica something.
- "Veronica something."

780
00:46:43,591 --> 00:46:46,082
- You gotta be kidding me.
- She worked for Jesse Drake.

781
00:46:46,183 --> 00:46:48,413
Every employee here
has got a security photo ID.

782
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,453
- She's got to be in the files.
- Oh, come on.

783
00:46:50,567 --> 00:46:51,728
Miles. Do it.

784
00:46:51,879 --> 00:46:55,212
I need this, Miles.
Just do it. Please.

785
00:46:58,151 --> 00:47:01,416
- Hurry up.
- A last name would really help.

786
00:47:01,479 --> 00:47:04,107
Yeah, well, how many Veronicas
can there be in the system?

787
00:47:05,608 --> 00:47:07,199
Come on, Miles.

788
00:47:07,336 --> 00:47:08,736
Hurry.

789
00:47:09,545 --> 00:47:13,274
- Miles.
- This is ridiculous. Come on.

790
00:47:13,320 --> 00:47:15,914
Come on. Come on.

791
00:47:16,008 --> 00:47:19,409
I can see him from here.
Come on, Miles, hurry.

792
00:47:19,464 --> 00:47:20,830
Miles.

793
00:47:20,969 --> 00:47:22,993
Hurry up. Miles.

794
00:47:23,881 --> 00:47:27,111
- Okay.
- Hurry.

795
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:29,406
Come on, come on.

796
00:47:31,113 --> 00:47:32,203
Yahtzee.

797
00:47:32,777 --> 00:47:36,269
Veronica Carter. Just download,
upload, exhale and send.

798
00:47:36,329 --> 00:47:38,320
You are awesome.

799
00:47:38,441 --> 00:47:40,930
Yeah, well, remember that
the next time you're firing me.

800
00:47:41,736 --> 00:47:42,863
Oh, Ro...

801
00:47:43,016 --> 00:47:45,576
...I' m meeting my guy
from the M.E.'s office, Bill Patel...

802
00:47:45,673 --> 00:47:46,765
...at Chumley's at 7:00.

803
00:47:46,921 --> 00:47:49,287
He's got the talks on Grace,
everything the cops have.

804
00:47:49,385 --> 00:47:51,751
Great. I' II meet you there.

805
00:47:54,664 --> 00:47:55,892
- Shit.
- What?

806
00:47:56,040 --> 00:47:58,941
My computer screen is frozen.
And Veronica's face is screen saver.

807
00:47:59,017 --> 00:48:00,450
What?

808
00:48:00,584 --> 00:48:01,950
- Miles.
- Turn it off.

809
00:48:02,089 --> 00:48:03,613
- Oh, fuck.
- Turn it off.

810
00:48:03,753 --> 00:48:05,346
Turn the power off.

811
00:48:06,313 --> 00:48:07,780
Fuck, he's coming.

812
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:10,910
- Hi.
- Hi.

813
00:48:11,464 --> 00:48:13,524
- Pretty busy for the end of the day.
- Yeah.

814
00:48:13,641 --> 00:48:14,630
Just working away.

815
00:48:14,793 --> 00:48:16,488
Anything I can help with?

816
00:48:17,450 --> 00:48:18,781
Nope.

817
00:48:19,337 --> 00:48:21,829
Not unless data entry turns you on.

818
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:25,377
You know what?
Surprisingly, it doesn't.

819
00:48:25,448 --> 00:48:26,973
But seriously, how you doing?

820
00:48:28,137 --> 00:48:30,162
Let me tell you about my night.

821
00:48:31,658 --> 00:48:35,686
I have to go to dinner at Sapa.
Average jokes, exceptional food.

822
00:48:36,234 --> 00:48:39,362
If you find yourself bored...

823
00:48:39,433 --> 00:48:44,337
...in the area of 24th and Sixth
around 10:00...

824
00:48:44,330 --> 00:48:46,992
...you could fall by for a drink.

825
00:48:48,042 --> 00:48:52,342
I really appreciate that offer,
but I think I' m gonna have to pass.

826
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:54,057
Okay.

827
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:01,085
Is there something else I can do
for you, or?

828
00:49:01,195 --> 00:49:02,559
No.

829
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:05,075
I'm just waiting for you to change
your mind.

830
00:49:07,753 --> 00:49:09,516
Look, Mr. Hill...

831
00:49:09,642 --> 00:49:13,237
I recognize that tone.
Sounds serious.

832
00:49:14,474 --> 00:49:16,033
I really like working here.

833
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:20,608
And I would really like for my work
to speak for itself.

834
00:49:21,610 --> 00:49:23,134
Fair enough.

835
00:49:24,746 --> 00:49:27,045
Have a splendid evening,
Miss Pogue.

836
00:49:30,827 --> 00:49:33,125
Wait. Mr. Hill?

837
00:49:35,307 --> 00:49:38,003
In case I change my mind...

838
00:49:39,467 --> 00:49:42,027
...keep an eye out around dessert.

839
00:49:45,068 --> 00:49:47,331
Hey, how you guys doing?

840
00:49:47,436 --> 00:49:50,871
- Miles.
- Bill Patel, Rowena Price.

841
00:49:50,923 --> 00:49:52,720
- A pleasure.
- You can lose the glasses.

842
00:49:52,843 --> 00:49:54,776
This isn't Deep Throat.

843
00:49:55,371 --> 00:49:57,499
Here's your pina colada,
hold the umbrella.

844
00:49:59,052 --> 00:50:01,953
We know about the drowning, Bill,
but what was this poison?

845
00:50:02,027 --> 00:50:03,290
Belladonna.

846
00:50:03,436 --> 00:50:04,902
What's that?

847
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:07,970
Highly toxic plant that's used
to make atropine.

848
00:50:08,043 --> 00:50:09,305
You know what that is, right?

849
00:50:09,452 --> 00:50:12,182
Well, yeah.
Atropine is used to dilate eyes.

850
00:50:12,266 --> 00:50:15,293
And for anesthesia, and in cardiac
medicine as a resuscitant...

851
00:50:15,372 --> 00:50:18,205
...and witchcraft.

852
00:50:19,819 --> 00:50:22,345
Coroner had cause of death listed
as atropine poisoning...

853
00:50:22,444 --> 00:50:26,504
...but I did a further test on the bile
and found it was belladonna.

854
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:27,701
Which means what?

855
00:50:27,852 --> 00:50:31,152
It's not the expensive synthetic type,
so it's more readily available...

856
00:50:31,213 --> 00:50:33,645
...harder to narrow down
where it came from.

857
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,037
Where do you get it?

858
00:50:35,852 --> 00:50:40,619
Well, you don't pop into Duane Reade
and order a vial, but it's accessible.

859
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,645
Easy enough to find
if you know where to look.

860
00:50:42,764 --> 00:50:45,063
Nowadays, you can pretty much get
anything online.

861
00:50:45,163 --> 00:50:46,892
But it's definitely toxic?

862
00:50:47,021 --> 00:50:50,820
Belladonna is used for eye surgeries,
but never in this amount.

863
00:50:50,861 --> 00:50:52,885
The killer put it in her eyes.

864
00:50:52,925 --> 00:50:58,455
Her death was brutal
and certainly no accident.

865
00:50:58,557 --> 00:50:59,650
Cheers.

866
00:51:02,238 --> 00:51:03,704
- Where you going?
- I gotta run.

867
00:51:03,837 --> 00:51:05,634
- Well, stick around for a while.
- I can't.

868
00:51:05,757 --> 00:51:09,784
I gotta run home. Going out for a drink.
Bill here can tell you more about it.

869
00:51:10,974 --> 00:51:12,965
Bill? You okay?

870
00:51:13,566 --> 00:51:14,692
Brain freeze.

871
00:51:14,845 --> 00:51:18,109
- Who are you getting drinks with?
- I will call you later.

872
00:51:18,174 --> 00:51:20,506
Bill, you have been a godsend.
Thank you.

873
00:51:21,278 --> 00:51:22,541
Breathe through the nose.

874
00:51:53,663 --> 00:51:54,822
Nice dress.

875
00:51:54,974 --> 00:51:57,169
- Nice party.
- Tell you what.

876
00:51:57,694 --> 00:51:59,855
Order two Hemingway daiquiris.

877
00:51:59,966 --> 00:52:02,525
This joint is one of two places
in all of New York City...

878
00:52:02,623 --> 00:52:05,147
...that makes great daiquiris.
I'll be back to tell you...

879
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,373
...why they taste like heaven.

880
00:52:07,998 --> 00:52:10,228
Did I tell you that's a great-looking
dress?

881
00:52:18,944 --> 00:52:20,844
No, no, no.

882
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:24,771
- You ready?
- Two daiquiris.

883
00:52:41,920 --> 00:52:43,285
Thank you.

884
00:52:43,649 --> 00:52:46,207
I'm dizzy from the spin
and I' m all the way over here.

885
00:52:48,704 --> 00:52:50,001
Here.

886
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,613
A very famous man once said
that sincerity is everything.

887
00:52:55,616 --> 00:52:58,586
Once you learn to fake that,
the rest is easy.

888
00:52:59,008 --> 00:53:02,466
So the Hemingway daiquiri...

889
00:53:02,560 --> 00:53:05,427
...is two ounces of light rum,
one ounce...

890
00:53:05,503 --> 00:53:08,063
One ounce lime juice,
one ounce simple syrup...

891
00:53:08,161 --> 00:53:10,925
...dash grapefruit grenadine float.

892
00:53:11,008 --> 00:53:14,067
Oh, I knew I had to worry about you.
You pay attention.

893
00:53:14,143 --> 00:53:18,546
I do. For instance,
I noticed that wedding ring.

894
00:53:18,561 --> 00:53:21,462
Oh, yes. I am married.

895
00:53:21,537 --> 00:53:24,097
- So what?
- So, what are you doing here with me?

896
00:53:24,192 --> 00:53:25,989
I'm having a Hemingway daiquiri
with you.

897
00:53:26,112 --> 00:53:28,672
- What are you doing here with me?
- Am I with you?

898
00:53:30,144 --> 00:53:31,338
Are you married?

899
00:53:31,489 --> 00:53:34,322
Wow, that would make this
really interesting, wouldn't it?

900
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,799
- No. God, no.
- No?

901
00:53:35,937 --> 00:53:37,962
- Just broke up with someone?
- No.

902
00:53:38,081 --> 00:53:39,548
- Gay?
- No.

903
00:53:39,681 --> 00:53:42,412
Actually, I' m thinking of joining
Match. Com.

904
00:53:42,496 --> 00:53:44,623
- No, you're not. Are you kidding me?
- Yes.

905
00:53:44,737 --> 00:53:46,398
- People date online.
- You're gorgeous.

906
00:53:46,527 --> 00:53:48,257
What do you think of it?

907
00:53:48,385 --> 00:53:50,410
My life is complicated enough
as it is.

908
00:53:50,528 --> 00:53:51,723
I'm having a drink with you.

909
00:53:51,873 --> 00:53:54,399
I'm trying to figure out
how I' m gonna explain that.

910
00:53:54,498 --> 00:53:56,295
Will you have to?

911
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,169
Hopefully not.

912
00:54:00,002 --> 00:54:01,765
Hopefully not.

913
00:54:01,888 --> 00:54:04,016
- Do you have kids?
- No.

914
00:54:04,129 --> 00:54:05,528
You don't have any kids, right?

915
00:54:05,666 --> 00:54:07,497
- No.
- Family?

916
00:54:07,617 --> 00:54:09,346
A mother.

917
00:54:10,626 --> 00:54:15,325
Here is to Gunnar Hope
and his corner office.

918
00:54:15,329 --> 00:54:17,320
Oh, God.

919
00:54:18,594 --> 00:54:21,586
- That was a little dramatic, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

920
00:54:21,666 --> 00:54:24,760
I refuse to be treated like that.
That fucking Phelps.

921
00:54:24,834 --> 00:54:26,164
Rat.

922
00:54:26,305 --> 00:54:27,532
Committed the cardinal sin.

923
00:54:27,682 --> 00:54:31,413
- Which is what?
- Don't betray your friends.

924
00:54:31,457 --> 00:54:32,947
Don't betray people who love you.

925
00:54:33,091 --> 00:54:34,079
Law of the jungle, huh?

926
00:54:34,242 --> 00:54:36,300
Law of the universe.

927
00:54:36,417 --> 00:54:39,251
It's not kill or be killed anymore.

928
00:54:39,329 --> 00:54:43,129
Kill or become irrelevant.

929
00:54:44,610 --> 00:54:47,511
So here's to not becoming
irrelevant.

930
00:54:48,641 --> 00:54:50,109
And don't be mad.

931
00:54:50,242 --> 00:54:52,506
Don't be mad that I' m married
or any of that.

932
00:54:52,611 --> 00:54:57,638
I mean, because that's, you know,
a different thing than what this is.

933
00:54:57,634 --> 00:54:59,101
Is it?

934
00:55:02,530 --> 00:55:05,021
I should probably just make some
arrangements...

935
00:55:05,123 --> 00:55:07,182
...to have a car take you home.

936
00:55:07,299 --> 00:55:08,789
Okay.

937
00:55:08,931 --> 00:55:10,364
Okay.

938
00:55:11,747 --> 00:55:14,273
Drink your Hemingway daiquiri.

939
00:55:20,579 --> 00:55:23,173
- Hello.
- Where the hell have you been, kiddo?

940
00:55:23,268 --> 00:55:26,759
- Late night.
- Yeah, I' II bet.

941
00:55:26,819 --> 00:55:28,514
Hey, wait a minute. Are you drunk?

942
00:55:29,092 --> 00:55:31,788
No. Sounds like you are.

943
00:55:31,874 --> 00:55:34,309
- No, I' m not.
- What's up?

944
00:55:34,402 --> 00:55:38,135
- Oh, just me waiting to talk to you.
- About?

945
00:55:39,201 --> 00:55:42,730
I kind of thought that we were doing
this story together.

946
00:55:42,787 --> 00:55:43,948
We are.

947
00:55:44,099 --> 00:55:47,194
I'm the one who's doing all the grunt
work while you're out drinking.

948
00:55:47,268 --> 00:55:49,863
You know, I mean, at least,
you can introduce me to the...

949
00:55:49,956 --> 00:55:51,947
At least, you can introduce me
to the lesbian.

950
00:55:52,068 --> 00:55:53,467
Take the virtual tour.

951
00:55:53,602 --> 00:55:56,163
I'm sure there's a lovely picture
of her there, Miles.

952
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:58,455
- Night, night.
- Wait, wait, wait.

953
00:55:59,235 --> 00:56:02,535
Remember that series of murders
they traced back to Riverbank Park?

954
00:56:02,594 --> 00:56:05,326
The drifter they never caught?

955
00:56:05,413 --> 00:56:08,643
Women that were being murdered
and tossed off the cliffs?

956
00:56:08,707 --> 00:56:10,573
Yeah, yeah. The Rufus Scott series.

957
00:56:10,691 --> 00:56:14,855
Yeah, well, the cops think
maybe the drifter tossed Grace.

958
00:56:15,044 --> 00:56:17,671
Yeah, well, maybe.

959
00:56:17,763 --> 00:56:22,326
But I' m gonna go to bed,
so let's talk about it tomorrow.

960
00:56:22,341 --> 00:56:24,534
- Sweet dreams.
- Bye.

961
00:56:31,077 --> 00:56:32,236
Tired?

962
00:56:37,731 --> 00:56:41,634
What did you have in mind?

963
00:56:41,924 --> 00:56:43,017
You.

964
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:46,636
The coffee room. Remember?

965
00:56:46,724 --> 00:56:50,661
- You rubbed against me.
- This is some good shit.

966
00:56:50,694 --> 00:56:53,127
Save this chat.

967
00:56:53,221 --> 00:56:54,916
Then you bent over.

968
00:56:55,044 --> 00:56:56,068
She did?

969
00:56:56,228 --> 00:56:58,253
You knew what you were doing
to me.

970
00:56:58,374 --> 00:57:00,068
You liked it.

971
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:02,300
Not quite.

972
00:57:02,436 --> 00:57:04,028
I can't stop thinking about you.

973
00:57:04,934 --> 00:57:07,094
Where's your boyfriend?

974
00:57:07,206 --> 00:57:09,537
You are a twisted...

975
00:57:09,637 --> 00:57:11,628
Where's your wife?

976
00:57:12,036 --> 00:57:14,369
- Out.
- Out. Figured.

977
00:57:14,981 --> 00:57:17,711
Looks like it's just you and me, Hill.

978
00:57:17,797 --> 00:57:19,628
Are you turned on?

979
00:57:19,751 --> 00:57:21,580
No.

980
00:57:22,052 --> 00:57:23,543
Me too.

981
00:57:24,933 --> 00:57:27,400
Are you trying to seduce me,
mister?

982
00:57:27,493 --> 00:57:30,054
Wait a minute, now I' m gonna
get your whole name...

983
00:57:30,151 --> 00:57:33,415
...Harrison Hill.

984
00:57:33,478 --> 00:57:35,809
- What are you wearing?
- Robe.

985
00:57:35,910 --> 00:57:38,844
- What's underneath?
- Panties.

986
00:57:38,917 --> 00:57:41,977
Ask what color. Come on, come on.
I know it. What color?

987
00:57:42,053 --> 00:57:43,748
What color?

988
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:47,695
I knew it.

989
00:57:47,814 --> 00:57:50,577
White. Sheer.

990
00:57:50,662 --> 00:57:53,291
- I like that.
- You like that?

991
00:57:53,381 --> 00:57:55,406
Now picture this.

992
00:57:55,941 --> 00:57:58,274
- We're on a beach.
- No, no. Let's keep this real.

993
00:57:58,374 --> 00:58:02,743
- Let's put this at H2A.
- Okay.

994
00:58:02,758 --> 00:58:04,884
- H2A.
- Yes.

995
00:58:05,541 --> 00:58:08,010
- No one's around.
- I got to tell you about this, Miles.

996
00:58:08,103 --> 00:58:10,036
You come into the coffee room.

997
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:13,707
I'm already there.

998
00:58:14,981 --> 00:58:18,974
Miles, chatting with Hill...

999
00:58:19,014 --> 00:58:24,612
...talking about H2A.
- You rub against me.

1000
00:58:25,831 --> 00:58:27,958
I lift up your skirt.

1001
00:58:28,646 --> 00:58:29,739
Veronica?

1002
00:58:30,246 --> 00:58:31,645
- Veronica.
- I' m coming.

1003
00:58:31,782 --> 00:58:35,480
- You there?
- Sorry. My hands were a little busy.

1004
00:58:35,526 --> 00:58:39,121
Mine too. At least one of them.

1005
00:58:42,439 --> 00:58:43,770
God, you're easy.

1006
00:58:44,328 --> 00:58:46,125
I'm gonna tell you what to do.

1007
00:58:46,248 --> 00:58:47,875
You like being told what to do?

1008
00:58:48,294 --> 00:58:50,057
Okay.

1009
00:58:50,184 --> 00:58:53,016
Trail your hands to your panties.

1010
00:58:54,215 --> 00:58:56,183
Go inside.

1011
00:58:57,191 --> 00:59:00,183
Can you feel me fucking you, Ro?

1012
00:59:14,055 --> 00:59:15,956
- Hey.
- Hi.

1013
00:59:16,361 --> 00:59:19,193
- What are you doing here?
- Giving you breakfast.

1014
00:59:19,271 --> 00:59:21,796
- Good morning.
- Yeah? Morning.

1015
00:59:25,448 --> 00:59:27,313
Don't answer it.

1016
00:59:27,433 --> 00:59:28,831
- I have to answer it.
- You don't.

1017
00:59:28,968 --> 00:59:30,400
- Wait, hold that thought.
- No, no.

1018
00:59:30,536 --> 00:59:32,503
Don't. Tell them that you're busy.

1019
00:59:32,615 --> 00:59:34,082
- Don't answer that.
- Hey.

1020
00:59:34,215 --> 00:59:37,446
Hey, I need to talk to you.
I think I got a breakthrough on Hill.

1021
00:59:37,512 --> 00:59:39,479
Please give me a second.
I gotta take this.

1022
00:59:39,591 --> 00:59:42,823
Okay, Miles, what's up?
Did you get my e-mail

1023
00:59:42,889 --> 00:59:45,551
Wait, tell me you didn't just say,
"Cam, give me a minute."

1024
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,072
I don't have time for this shit.

1025
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:50,143
- What?
- Oh, you're busy, huh?

1026
00:59:51,433 --> 00:59:53,628
Well, look, there's too much
to go over right now.

1027
00:59:53,736 --> 00:59:55,567
Can you meet me
at the Grill Room at 1:00?

1028
00:59:55,688 --> 00:59:57,553
- Yeah.
- I hate that he's there, Ro.

1029
00:59:57,672 --> 01:00:00,198
Yeah, I know you do.

1030
01:00:00,778 --> 01:00:02,836
Hey, Ro.

1031
01:00:03,879 --> 01:00:05,108
Did Cam happen to mention...

1032
01:00:05,256 --> 01:00:08,225
...that he's having a DNA test today
for Grace's baby?

1033
01:00:08,617 --> 01:00:10,710
Three o'clock, 31 st Precinct.

1034
01:00:11,304 --> 01:00:13,136
Cops have them together
in November.

1035
01:00:13,258 --> 01:00:14,225
Coffee.

1036
01:00:14,826 --> 01:00:16,986
Did he happen to mention that?

1037
01:00:18,473 --> 01:00:20,736
What is it with great women
and shitty men?

1038
01:00:20,841 --> 01:00:22,035
I don't know.

1039
01:00:22,184 --> 01:00:24,710
You figure it out. Tell me later.

1040
01:00:26,665 --> 01:00:28,030
No more phones.

1041
01:00:35,208 --> 01:00:36,938
What are you doing later?

1042
01:00:37,065 --> 01:00:38,896
- You.
- No, I mean, like later.

1043
01:00:39,017 --> 01:00:41,008
This afternoon later.

1044
01:00:41,514 --> 01:00:44,142
Showing a couple of places uptown.

1045
01:00:44,873 --> 01:00:45,839
Oh, really?

1046
01:00:45,993 --> 01:00:48,018
- What about downtown?
- What do you mean?

1047
01:00:48,137 --> 01:00:51,368
- Thirty-first Precinct.
- What?

1048
01:00:51,433 --> 01:00:53,368
Three o'clock.

1049
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:57,992
Fucking liar. Thought you said you
hadn't seen Grace in over a year.

1050
01:00:58,027 --> 01:00:58,993
I haven't.

1051
01:00:59,145 --> 01:01:02,081
That must be why the cops
have you with her three months ago.

1052
01:01:02,762 --> 01:01:04,423
- Thanks.
- Thought you said it was over.

1053
01:01:04,554 --> 01:01:06,715
You said you didn't give a shit
about that bitch.

1054
01:01:06,826 --> 01:01:09,225
- I don't.
- You sat your ass right there and said:

1055
01:01:09,321 --> 01:01:11,347
- "I love you, Ro."
- I do, Ro.

1056
01:01:11,467 --> 01:01:12,661
You're a fucking liar.

1057
01:01:16,137 --> 01:01:18,197
Was it yours?

1058
01:01:20,810 --> 01:01:24,405
Could it have been yours?

1059
01:01:29,610 --> 01:01:31,100
I don't know.

1060
01:01:33,161 --> 01:01:37,155
- You don't know.
- Ro...

1061
01:01:37,483 --> 01:01:39,417
Get the hell out of my house.

1062
01:02:12,043 --> 01:02:13,566
- Good morning, Larry.
- Good morning.

1063
01:02:16,619 --> 01:02:17,916
Hey.

1064
01:02:18,891 --> 01:02:20,018
Good morning.

1065
01:02:20,171 --> 01:02:21,639
Morning.

1066
01:02:24,108 --> 01:02:25,507
Okay.

1067
01:02:25,836 --> 01:02:27,826
I give up. What?

1068
01:02:27,947 --> 01:02:29,744
You didn't read the paper today?

1069
01:02:29,867 --> 01:02:32,837
Today is "National Take Your Best
Employee to Work Day."

1070
01:02:34,092 --> 01:02:36,322
So I guess you're going to pick up
Esmeralda next.

1071
01:02:36,428 --> 01:02:39,556
You know what? Esmeralda rides
a broom to work every day.

1072
01:02:42,828 --> 01:02:45,592
That's funny. Very funny.
A sense of humor.

1073
01:02:48,492 --> 01:02:50,892
Bobby, say hi to Katherine.

1074
01:02:51,340 --> 01:02:54,434
Hi, Esmeralda, it's me again.
Is he still in a meeting?

1075
01:02:54,924 --> 01:02:57,950
Well, just let him know I called
and I' II see him later.

1076
01:02:58,028 --> 01:02:59,187
Thanks.

1077
01:03:07,724 --> 01:03:09,317
Thank you.

1078
01:03:15,148 --> 01:03:20,451
Gentlemen, welcome to New York,
or as we like to call it, Reebok Town.

1079
01:03:22,732 --> 01:03:24,997
Come and have a seat
right over here.

1080
01:03:28,204 --> 01:03:32,800
That ass kissing will go on all
afternoon. Wanna take a long lunch?

1081
01:03:33,101 --> 01:03:37,800
No, actually, I can't.
I've got to meet a friend downtown.

1082
01:03:37,805 --> 01:03:39,294
I'll see you.

1083
01:03:40,268 --> 01:03:41,860
Fancy lady.

1084
01:03:42,701 --> 01:03:45,067
- So, what's up?
- I stumbled across some information...

1085
01:03:45,165 --> 01:03:47,191
...about Hill 's wife
and her family fortune.

1086
01:03:47,309 --> 01:03:50,278
They had millions and millions.
And they invested a lot of it...

1087
01:03:50,349 --> 01:03:52,783
...into medical research.
One of the guys they backed...

1088
01:03:52,877 --> 01:03:55,744
...revolutionized surgery
by finding a medicinal use...

1089
01:03:55,821 --> 01:03:58,654
...for a poisonous plant
called belladonna.

1090
01:03:58,733 --> 01:04:02,397
We have proof that Hill was ADEX.
We have proof that ADEX knew Grace.

1091
01:04:02,445 --> 01:04:04,004
We have the motive,
the pregnancy...

1092
01:04:04,141 --> 01:04:09,044
...now we have knowledge and history
that links Hill directly with belladonna.

1093
01:04:09,133 --> 01:04:12,330
The only thing we don't have is access
to Hill 's personal e-mail account.

1094
01:04:12,397 --> 01:04:14,366
What are you talking about?
We do have access.

1095
01:04:14,478 --> 01:04:16,775
That's his IOL account.
His main account is with H2A.

1096
01:04:16,877 --> 01:04:19,540
I can't get to it. There's a firewall.
There's something new.

1097
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:21,894
I can't scale it with a remote.

1098
01:04:22,638 --> 01:04:25,037
- Take this.
- And what's that?

1099
01:04:25,133 --> 01:04:27,499
It's new spyware you'll mickey
into Hill 's laptop.

1100
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:30,089
Go at the end of the day,
install it into the computer...

1101
01:04:30,190 --> 01:04:31,714
...and bury it into the hard drive.

1102
01:04:31,854 --> 01:04:35,585
- And how long will that take?
- Three minutes and 14 seconds.

1103
01:04:35,630 --> 01:04:38,154
But that's just a guess.

1104
01:05:11,759 --> 01:05:13,317
SPYrid?

1105
01:05:13,455 --> 01:05:15,514
Fuck. What?

1106
01:05:19,662 --> 01:05:21,630
- Yeah?
- Okay. So he's got antispyware...

1107
01:05:21,743 --> 01:05:23,836
...on his computer.
There's a big sign that says:

1108
01:05:23,951 --> 01:05:26,078
"Stop in the name of SPYrid."

1109
01:05:26,192 --> 01:05:28,716
SPYrid? Oh, he's definitely
hiding something.

1110
01:05:28,815 --> 01:05:31,181
There was a leak, so they probably
went into lockdown.

1111
01:05:31,279 --> 01:05:33,111
What do I do?
He's asking for a password.

1112
01:05:34,128 --> 01:05:36,721
It's new. Look, I can get in,
but it'll take a few minutes.

1113
01:05:36,815 --> 01:05:39,648
Just take the flash drive out,
we'll do it later. I' m sorry.

1114
01:05:39,728 --> 01:05:41,388
Sorry? All you can say is sorry?

1115
01:05:41,519 --> 01:05:44,148
- Well, I don't...
- Well, tell me something.

1116
01:05:50,447 --> 01:05:52,177
Usually the competition's smarter...

1117
01:05:52,302 --> 01:05:55,831
...than to send a beautiful temp
into the boss's office...

1118
01:05:55,887 --> 01:05:59,914
...to snoop around on his fucking
computer to try and find fresh ideas.

1119
01:05:59,952 --> 01:06:01,977
- I, well, l- -
- No, wait.

1120
01:06:02,097 --> 01:06:05,827
Let me see if I can help you.
I am in your office...

1121
01:06:06,446 --> 01:06:10,612
...and I really need to come up
with a really honest story.

1122
01:06:11,696 --> 01:06:16,566
No. I was really just gonna...
I don't know, tell you the truth.

1123
01:06:16,560 --> 01:06:18,186
Go ahead. Give that a shot.

1124
01:06:18,321 --> 01:06:22,723
I came in here
because I wanted to leave you a note.

1125
01:06:23,024 --> 01:06:25,958
I wanted to do it at the end of the day
when there was nobody here.

1126
01:06:26,032 --> 01:06:29,560
I really didn't want everybody
in this office to know...

1127
01:06:29,617 --> 01:06:31,642
...that the new girl...

1128
01:06:31,825 --> 01:06:36,124
...has got a big crush on the boss.

1129
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:39,247
And what was this little note
gonna say?

1130
01:06:39,696 --> 01:06:42,187
Well, it was gonna say
that you're wrong...

1131
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,993
...because there's 17 restaurants
in this city...

1132
01:06:45,104 --> 01:06:48,504
...that make the
Hemingway daiquiri.

1133
01:06:49,968 --> 01:06:52,130
Who were you talking to
on the phone?

1134
01:06:52,241 --> 01:06:53,606
- Eddie.
- Eddie?

1135
01:06:53,744 --> 01:06:54,904
My friend Eddie.

1136
01:06:55,056 --> 01:06:57,581
He's a bartender
and he was helping me...

1137
01:06:58,193 --> 01:06:59,285
...put together the list.

1138
01:06:59,441 --> 01:07:01,535
I realize that I didn't remember
all 17 bars...

1139
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:05,278
...so I was calling him for help
and l- -

1140
01:07:05,745 --> 01:07:07,645
I'm sorry.

1141
01:07:08,209 --> 01:07:11,269
- And I' m positive I' m fired.
- Get out.

1142
01:07:16,210 --> 01:07:18,303
Here. This is the list of the bars.

1143
01:07:18,418 --> 01:07:21,581
- Please get...
- I' m telling you the truth.

1144
01:07:21,649 --> 01:07:23,379
This...

1145
01:07:23,505 --> 01:07:24,904
...is what I was leaving.

1146
01:07:27,314 --> 01:07:29,179
You might wanna...

1147
01:07:29,298 --> 01:07:30,959
...check them out.

1148
01:07:37,170 --> 01:07:39,763
Hey. This is what you want me
to believe?

1149
01:07:39,858 --> 01:07:41,690
That you came in here...

1150
01:07:41,971 --> 01:07:43,495
...for this list?

1151
01:07:44,723 --> 01:07:46,190
Yeah.

1152
01:07:47,570 --> 01:07:49,059
Okay.

1153
01:07:49,937 --> 01:07:51,837
Well, you're fired.

1154
01:07:55,794 --> 01:07:57,853
Because I don't wanna take you
to dinner...

1155
01:07:57,970 --> 01:07:59,938
...as your boss.

1156
01:08:00,978 --> 01:08:06,408
I mean, maybe I' II rehire you
in the morning or maybe after dessert.

1157
01:08:06,483 --> 01:08:09,975
You can tell me all about this crush
you have on the boss.

1158
01:08:13,555 --> 01:08:14,817
Okay.

1159
01:08:37,043 --> 01:08:40,308
- I did that?
- Yes, you did that.

1160
01:08:49,362 --> 01:08:50,887
- Where you going?
- Wait.

1161
01:08:52,403 --> 01:08:54,598
I've gotta go to the bathroom.
I'll be right back.

1162
01:08:54,707 --> 01:08:55,867
All right.

1163
01:08:57,909 --> 01:08:59,465
- I' II be right back.
- You all right?

1164
01:10:38,006 --> 01:10:40,497
All of a sudden I' m not feeling
that good.

1165
01:10:40,599 --> 01:10:42,964
I think maybe you should
take me home.

1166
01:10:45,781 --> 01:10:48,181
Too much sake, I think.

1167
01:11:10,037 --> 01:11:12,632
Which way are we going?
My exit's back there.

1168
01:11:41,814 --> 01:11:44,248
How far are you prepared
to take this?

1169
01:11:47,223 --> 01:11:49,247
Say your name.

1170
01:11:50,328 --> 01:11:51,794
Go ahead. Just say it.

1171
01:11:53,145 --> 01:11:56,078
- Katherine.
- Bullshit.

1172
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:58,710
- Katherine Pogue.
- Bullshit.

1173
01:12:04,503 --> 01:12:05,993
Bullshit.

1174
01:12:09,784 --> 01:12:13,185
Okay. You need to take me home.

1175
01:12:14,134 --> 01:12:15,659
Esmeralda was right.

1176
01:12:19,351 --> 01:12:21,512
And I didn't want to believe her.

1177
01:12:25,014 --> 01:12:27,848
You're a spy for Kirschenbaum,
right?

1178
01:12:29,081 --> 01:12:30,742
Answer me!

1179
01:12:32,183 --> 01:12:33,811
Don't wanna talk?

1180
01:12:34,967 --> 01:12:36,867
Well, I' II tell you what.

1181
01:12:37,465 --> 01:12:39,193
How about this?

1182
01:12:40,376 --> 01:12:45,438
Let's get your pal M on the phone.

1183
01:12:45,432 --> 01:12:49,266
Who the fuck is M?
And why is my name on this text?

1184
01:12:54,679 --> 01:12:56,045
Okay.

1185
01:12:57,048 --> 01:12:59,448
I'm gonna ask you one more time.

1186
01:12:59,545 --> 01:13:01,980
- Are you or are you not a fucking spy?
- Yes.

1187
01:13:02,073 --> 01:13:03,803
- What?
- Yes.

1188
01:13:07,320 --> 01:13:08,753
Phelps, right?

1189
01:13:10,040 --> 01:13:12,031
You and that scumbag Phelps
the whole time.

1190
01:13:12,633 --> 01:13:14,794
From the first day. Right?

1191
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:18,064
How much could they be
paying you?

1192
01:13:18,168 --> 01:13:20,933
Are they paying you more
than hooker money?

1193
01:13:21,144 --> 01:13:23,169
Because that's what you are, right?

1194
01:13:23,961 --> 01:13:26,225
Do you even know what the word
loyalty means?

1195
01:13:26,329 --> 01:13:28,389
I bet your wife is wondering
the same thing.

1196
01:13:41,338 --> 01:13:44,774
I am so disappointed in you
right now.

1197
01:13:45,690 --> 01:13:47,920
But just because you wanna hurt
somebody...

1198
01:13:49,337 --> 01:13:51,065
...doesn't mean that you will.

1199
01:14:24,313 --> 01:14:27,214
Harrison. I' m sorry. I have...

1200
01:14:27,290 --> 01:14:29,986
I've never spied on anybody
like this.

1201
01:14:32,507 --> 01:14:34,166
Fuck you.

1202
01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:38,028
Get out.

1203
01:15:00,316 --> 01:15:01,782
Rowena.

1204
01:15:05,786 --> 01:15:09,120
Rowena.

1205
01:15:10,746 --> 01:15:13,112
Rowena.

1206
01:15:18,300 --> 01:15:20,097
Come on, honey.

1207
01:15:22,939 --> 01:15:24,963
I wonder where could she be?

1208
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:33,687
Bath time.

1209
01:15:34,459 --> 01:15:37,190
No.

1210
01:15:38,523 --> 01:15:40,549
Ro, I called you
50 fucking times last night.

1211
01:15:40,668 --> 01:15:43,135
I called you at H2A,
they said you no longer work there.

1212
01:15:43,228 --> 01:15:44,820
I mean, what the fuck?
Where are you?

1213
01:15:44,956 --> 01:15:47,355
On the way to the rehab center
to see my mother.

1214
01:15:47,452 --> 01:15:50,785
Last time I spoke to you was when you
jimmied the lock on Hill 's computer.

1215
01:15:50,845 --> 01:15:52,937
Any idea of the thoughts
going through my head?

1216
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:56,632
Hill saw the text message
you sent me last night.

1217
01:15:56,731 --> 01:15:58,667
- What?
- So I guess we won't be getting...

1218
01:15:58,781 --> 01:16:00,543
...into his computer after all.
- Oh, no.

1219
01:16:00,668 --> 01:16:02,761
No, no, no.

1220
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:06,493
No, it's okay.
I'll figure something out.

1221
01:16:06,587 --> 01:16:10,684
- Don't worry about it. Are you okay?
- Yeah. I' m good.

1222
01:16:13,374 --> 01:16:15,863
Look, can we...

1223
01:16:16,283 --> 01:16:17,682
...have an early dinner tonight?

1224
01:16:17,821 --> 01:16:21,222
You can bring your laptop and we'll
start putting the story together?

1225
01:16:21,276 --> 01:16:23,575
- Okay.
- Okay?

1226
01:16:23,676 --> 01:16:28,239
Oh, good. You never say okay,
and that's good. I love okay.

1227
01:16:28,446 --> 01:16:32,005
Oh, good.
I'm just glad you're out of there.

1228
01:16:32,060 --> 01:16:34,495
Yeah. Me too.

1229
01:16:36,348 --> 01:16:38,510
Okay, I' II see you tonight.

1230
01:16:39,069 --> 01:16:41,697
- Bye.
- Bye.

1231
01:16:46,877 --> 01:16:48,539
Phyllis?

1232
01:16:49,181 --> 01:16:51,149
Anybody here?

1233
01:16:52,348 --> 01:16:54,078
Hello?

1234
01:16:58,046 --> 01:16:59,377
Hi, Mom.

1235
01:17:09,054 --> 01:17:11,022
You look pretty.

1236
01:17:12,254 --> 01:17:13,913
- Hello, can I help you?
- Oh, yeah, hi.

1237
01:17:14,045 --> 01:17:17,208
I'm from IT. I was sent to run the detox
on Mr. Hill 's computer.

1238
01:17:17,277 --> 01:17:21,408
Fascinating. Wanna know why?
Nobody called IT.

1239
01:17:21,438 --> 01:17:23,600
Well, your computer did, sir.

1240
01:17:24,190 --> 01:17:28,284
When any computer hooked up
to the grid goes down, it cries for help.

1241
01:17:28,318 --> 01:17:31,014
- A cry for help. Have you tried these?
- No.

1242
01:17:31,102 --> 01:17:32,797
- There's honey in the center.
- Thank...

1243
01:17:32,925 --> 01:17:35,622
- I' m Harrison Hill.
- Benson comma Kurt.

1244
01:17:35,710 --> 01:17:38,110
Interesting name.
Let me ask you something.

1245
01:17:38,206 --> 01:17:39,639
Could this have anything to do...

1246
01:17:39,774 --> 01:17:42,107
...with someone installing spyware
on my computer?

1247
01:17:42,208 --> 01:17:43,833
It could have to do with anything...

1248
01:17:43,966 --> 01:17:47,765
...but I won't know until I give
your computer a clean scrub.

1249
01:17:47,806 --> 01:17:50,036
- I like a good, clean scrub.
- Yeah.

1250
01:17:50,205 --> 01:17:52,835
I need about 10 minutes in my office,
but in the meantime...

1251
01:17:52,927 --> 01:17:55,258
...Josie wouldn't mind
showing you around the office.

1252
01:17:55,358 --> 01:17:56,450
Hello, Josie.

1253
01:17:56,607 --> 01:17:59,007
Josie, meet Benson comma Kurt.

1254
01:17:59,102 --> 01:18:02,265
Esmeralda, can I have those mockups
that Gunnar left someplace, please?

1255
01:18:02,334 --> 01:18:04,030
Yes, yes, I know right where it is.

1256
01:18:04,158 --> 01:18:07,060
- Follow me.
- Josie.

1257
01:18:18,911 --> 01:18:21,175
Come on, Miles.

1258
01:18:21,279 --> 01:18:22,540
Shit.

1259
01:18:26,750 --> 01:18:28,776
Beautiful space.

1260
01:18:29,470 --> 01:18:31,371
Beautiful people.

1261
01:18:32,896 --> 01:18:35,886
Beautiful pictures. Are those?
Are those planets?

1262
01:18:35,967 --> 01:18:38,834
No, eyes.

1263
01:18:38,912 --> 01:18:42,972
Mrs. Hill did a whole series:
"Inside the Dilated Eye."

1264
01:18:43,231 --> 01:18:45,391
We have a guest computer.

1265
01:18:45,503 --> 01:18:48,495
Take the virtual tour.
It's very informative.

1266
01:18:49,824 --> 01:18:52,657
I'll be in my office if you need me.

1267
01:19:10,399 --> 01:19:13,892
Oh, thanks. I got locked out.

1268
01:19:52,865 --> 01:19:54,799
Miles is sexy.

1269
01:19:56,736 --> 01:19:58,398
Miles?

1270
01:20:06,849 --> 01:20:07,838
Miles is sexy.

1271
01:20:20,674 --> 01:20:22,539
Miles is sexy.

1272
01:20:33,059 --> 01:20:34,923
Miles is sexy.

1273
01:20:52,866 --> 01:20:54,834
Miles is sexy.

1274
01:21:26,146 --> 01:21:27,703
Miles is sexy.

1275
01:21:48,036 --> 01:21:49,900
Miles is sexy.

1276
01:21:54,371 --> 01:21:57,272
"Welcome, Trublu"?

1277
01:22:06,436 --> 01:22:07,562
Miles is sexy.

1278
01:22:17,957 --> 01:22:19,821
Miles is sexy.

1279
01:22:27,909 --> 01:22:29,967
Miles is sexy.

1280
01:22:37,571 --> 01:22:39,563
Miles is sexy.

1281
01:22:48,355 --> 01:22:50,290
Miles is sexy.

1282
01:22:58,661 --> 01:23:00,687
Miles is sexy.

1283
01:23:06,596 --> 01:23:08,757
- Miles is sexy.
- Can I help you?

1284
01:23:08,868 --> 01:23:10,961
What the fuck, Miles?

1285
01:23:11,077 --> 01:23:14,774
What are you doing in this room?
Well, I heard my voice...

1286
01:23:15,301 --> 01:23:17,166
...coming from your computer.

1287
01:23:17,285 --> 01:23:19,254
That's what I' m doing.

1288
01:23:19,684 --> 01:23:22,415
- It 's a joke. That's just a joke.
- Oh, it's a joke, huh?

1289
01:23:22,501 --> 01:23:26,528
Well, are all these pictures
on this computer a joke?

1290
01:23:26,566 --> 01:23:27,533
Miles is sexy.

1291
01:23:27,686 --> 01:23:31,850
Are the pictures of me out there
on that goddamn dummy a joke?

1292
01:23:33,253 --> 01:23:34,720
I'll tell you what's funny.

1293
01:23:34,853 --> 01:23:37,651
What's funny is the fact that
you said you hadn't seen Grace...

1294
01:23:37,734 --> 01:23:41,693
...but yet you got pictures of her
on your computer from October.

1295
01:23:41,735 --> 01:23:46,603
Nude pictures, all fucking chained up
and strapped up and shit.

1296
01:23:46,597 --> 01:23:49,294
Hey, can we go in the other room
and talk about this?

1297
01:23:49,381 --> 01:23:52,350
Let's talk about him. Trublu.

1298
01:23:52,422 --> 01:23:54,823
Maybe your pal Trublu
took all these pictures.

1299
01:23:54,918 --> 01:23:57,444
Maybe Trublu took all these
fucking pictures in here.

1300
01:23:57,543 --> 01:23:58,839
You freak.

1301
01:23:58,982 --> 01:24:01,542
- Wait a minute.
- Go ahead, admit it.

1302
01:24:01,861 --> 01:24:05,229
Fucking admit it right now.
You were ADEX.

1303
01:24:17,574 --> 01:24:21,305
- Two or three times, yeah.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.

1304
01:24:21,351 --> 01:24:24,843
You've been manipulating
this whole thing, haven't you?

1305
01:24:24,902 --> 01:24:28,395
Lying to me. Fucking Grace.

1306
01:24:28,454 --> 01:24:30,387
Who didn't?

1307
01:24:33,190 --> 01:24:36,421
You were trying to set up
Harrison Hill, huh?

1308
01:24:38,855 --> 01:24:41,517
Wait a minute. You think that
because of this...

1309
01:24:41,608 --> 01:24:43,508
...that I had something to do
with that?

1310
01:24:43,624 --> 01:24:46,386
Why wouldn't I You can't keep
changing your identity, Miles...

1311
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:48,336
...and expect people to trust you.

1312
01:24:48,455 --> 01:24:50,389
Don't be such a fucking hypocrite,
Ro.

1313
01:24:50,951 --> 01:24:53,147
- Fuck you.
- No. Fuck you.

1314
01:24:53,480 --> 01:24:56,107
I've been working my ass off
on this for you the whole time.

1315
01:24:56,199 --> 01:24:59,225
- Everybody has secrets, Ro.
- Right. Everybody's got secrets, huh?

1316
01:24:59,304 --> 01:25:01,295
Until they get caught.

1317
01:25:02,695 --> 01:25:06,462
Let's see.
Take a fucking look at something.

1318
01:25:06,502 --> 01:25:10,962
You told me to take the virtual tour
of H2A.

1319
01:25:10,983 --> 01:25:12,008
When you do...

1320
01:25:12,167 --> 01:25:15,192
...when you click on the photographs
hanging in the reception area...

1321
01:25:15,271 --> 01:25:17,263
...it links you to Mia Hill 's webpage.

1322
01:25:17,383 --> 01:25:19,749
She took photographs of dilated eyes,
Ro.

1323
01:25:19,846 --> 01:25:22,145
They're eyes. Look.
"Mia Rheinhart Hill replicates...

1324
01:25:22,248 --> 01:25:24,182
...a phenomenon fashionable
in the 1920s...

1325
01:25:24,295 --> 01:25:28,458
...the dilation of a woman's pupils
with the use of belladonna."

1326
01:25:28,487 --> 01:25:31,854
This is it.
This puts the poison in his hands...

1327
01:25:31,910 --> 01:25:34,642
...or it puts the poison
in his wife's hands.

1328
01:25:34,727 --> 01:25:36,253
This is it.

1329
01:25:37,383 --> 01:25:39,613
This is what we've been looking for.

1330
01:25:43,208 --> 01:25:45,233
You need to get help.

1331
01:25:47,079 --> 01:25:49,172
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1332
01:25:49,288 --> 01:25:51,223
This is the story.

1333
01:25:51,945 --> 01:25:53,913
Can I go now?

1334
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:23,941
I have a history of powerful men
squashing stories...

1335
01:26:23,977 --> 01:26:26,037
...and hiding facts...

1336
01:26:26,154 --> 01:26:27,814
...so I wanted to get this together.

1337
01:26:27,945 --> 01:26:30,812
Give it to you before Harrison Hill
had a chance to do just that.

1338
01:26:39,081 --> 01:26:41,015
"Veronica. What's new?"

1339
01:26:43,624 --> 01:26:46,115
"Boyfriend's out of town."

1340
01:26:48,489 --> 01:26:51,287
"Which means?" You tell me.

1341
01:26:52,713 --> 01:26:54,443
"Hotel Gansevoort."

1342
01:26:56,296 --> 01:26:58,595
"I'll leave a key under your name."

1343
01:26:58,698 --> 01:27:02,828
"From room 1801,
the view is spectacular...

1344
01:27:02,858 --> 01:27:04,689
...especially the sunrise."

1345
01:27:14,058 --> 01:27:15,548
Are you Harrison Hill?

1346
01:27:18,155 --> 01:27:19,553
Yeah.

1347
01:27:21,035 --> 01:27:24,368
Mr. Hill, I' m gonna need you to put
your hands behind your back.

1348
01:27:27,402 --> 01:27:30,394
You're under arrest for the murder
of Grace Clayton.

1349
01:27:30,731 --> 01:27:33,995
- Who?
- "Fast Filly."

1350
01:27:34,954 --> 01:27:38,355
You have the right to remain silent
and refuse to answer any questions.

1351
01:27:38,412 --> 01:27:42,278
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

1352
01:27:42,314 --> 01:27:45,442
You have the right to hire an attorney
before speaking to the police...

1353
01:27:45,514 --> 01:27:48,415
...and have an attorney present during
questioning any time now...

1354
01:27:48,490 --> 01:27:50,151
...or in the future.

1355
01:27:50,347 --> 01:27:53,612
The State of New York will prove
beyond a reasonable doubt...

1356
01:27:53,676 --> 01:27:58,840
...that the defendant, Harrison
Matthew Hill, did intentionally...

1357
01:27:58,827 --> 01:28:02,456
...and with premeditation commit
the heinous murder...

1358
01:28:02,507 --> 01:28:04,304
...of Grace Alexandra Clayton.

1359
01:28:05,003 --> 01:28:06,835
Are you aware of the hundreds
of e-mails...

1360
01:28:06,956 --> 01:28:09,286
...between your husband
and other women?

1361
01:28:09,739 --> 01:28:11,104
Now I am.

1362
01:28:11,242 --> 01:28:13,438
Mrs. Hill, where do you keep
your belladonna?

1363
01:28:13,547 --> 01:28:17,176
It's in my medicine cabinet
in my photography studio downtown.

1364
01:28:17,228 --> 01:28:20,025
The state will present irrefutable
physical evidence...

1365
01:28:20,108 --> 01:28:23,737
...that places the murder weapon,
poison called belladonna...

1366
01:28:23,787 --> 01:28:28,452
...in the defendant's car
commingled with the victim's blood...

1367
01:28:28,459 --> 01:28:30,586
...hair and bodily secretions.

1368
01:28:30,699 --> 01:28:31,792
We got blood.

1369
01:28:31,947 --> 01:28:35,576
And, finally, you will learn
about Grace Clayton...

1370
01:28:35,628 --> 01:28:38,357
...a young woman
who believed the lies...

1371
01:28:38,444 --> 01:28:41,106
...that this ad man was selling...

1372
01:28:41,195 --> 01:28:43,561
...never realizing the price
that she would pay...

1373
01:28:43,660 --> 01:28:45,992
...would be her own tragic death.

1374
01:28:46,091 --> 01:28:47,888
Thank you for your time
and consideration.

1375
01:28:48,011 --> 01:28:49,979
Ilook forward to your
verdict at the close.

1376
01:28:50,091 --> 01:28:53,788
All over the city, really.
But most often at his hotel suite.

1377
01:28:53,835 --> 01:28:55,267
He kept one at the Gansevoort.

1378
01:28:55,404 --> 01:28:57,531
He liked to watch the sun rise
over the city.

1379
01:28:57,645 --> 01:29:01,546
He just didn't want his wife to find out.
If she did, it was over.

1380
01:29:01,581 --> 01:29:06,245
The hair, blood and secretions
all matched the victim, Grace Clayton.

1381
01:29:06,251 --> 01:29:09,345
Additionally, we did find some trace
elements of belladonna extract.

1382
01:29:09,421 --> 01:29:12,514
All significant financial holdings
are in the name of his wife...

1383
01:29:12,588 --> 01:29:15,113
...Mia Rheinhart Hill.
- It was after midnight on the 5th.

1384
01:29:15,212 --> 01:29:16,440
I just started my shift.

1385
01:29:16,589 --> 01:29:19,558
This blond woman was freaking out,
wanting to see Mr. Hill.

1386
01:29:19,660 --> 01:29:21,320
I buzzed him. There was no answer.

1387
01:29:21,453 --> 01:29:23,886
She left an envelope,
but she wasn't happy.

1388
01:29:23,981 --> 01:29:27,815
About an hour later, Mr. Hill came
down, he took the envelope and left.

1389
01:29:27,853 --> 01:29:29,547
I didn't see him the rest of the night.

1390
01:29:29,678 --> 01:29:31,076
I'm holding in my hand a copy...

1391
01:29:31,212 --> 01:29:33,976
...of State's Exhibit Number Three
in evidence which reads:

1392
01:29:34,092 --> 01:29:36,925
"Grace. Don't come by my house.

1393
01:29:37,579 --> 01:29:40,846
Don't come by my office.
We are done.

1394
01:29:40,909 --> 01:29:43,605
Leave me the fuck alone."

1395
01:29:43,692 --> 01:29:46,253
Can you please tell the jury
where this came from?

1396
01:29:46,350 --> 01:29:50,912
I retrieved it from Harrison's hard drive
after the police seized his computer.

1397
01:29:53,900 --> 01:29:58,531
It starts with a quiet hum,
an empty screen inviting you.

1398
01:29:58,765 --> 01:30:02,565
- Has the jury reached a verdict?
- Yes, we have, Your Honor.

1399
01:30:05,262 --> 01:30:06,751
"Come inside," it says.

1400
01:30:07,660 --> 01:30:09,492
"We're always open."

1401
01:30:09,998 --> 01:30:12,558
Will the defendant please rise?

1402
01:30:15,597 --> 01:30:18,328
How do you find on the charge
of murder in the first degree?

1403
01:30:22,286 --> 01:30:26,245
It's a world, you think, where
actions have no consequence...

1404
01:30:27,343 --> 01:30:29,777
...where guilt is cloaked
by anonymity...

1405
01:30:31,214 --> 01:30:33,774
...where there are no fingerprints.

1406
01:30:36,174 --> 01:30:38,665
An invisible universe...

1407
01:30:41,743 --> 01:30:44,143
...filled with strangers...

1408
01:30:44,624 --> 01:30:46,887
...interconnected online...

1409
01:30:47,599 --> 01:30:49,498
...and disconnected in life.

1410
01:30:51,087 --> 01:30:53,351
It will steal your secrets...

1411
01:30:53,711 --> 01:30:55,373
...corrupt your dreams...

1412
01:30:57,134 --> 01:31:00,035
...and co-opt your identity.

1413
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:03,830
Because in this world...

1414
01:31:05,262 --> 01:31:07,752
...where you can be anything
you want...

1415
01:31:08,494 --> 01:31:10,520
...anyone you want...

1416
01:31:12,560 --> 01:31:15,188
...you just might lose sight...

1417
01:31:16,401 --> 01:31:18,196
...of who you are.

1418
01:31:30,063 --> 01:31:32,031
Hello, Rowena.

1419
01:31:32,846 --> 01:31:35,406
You know how much Daddy
likes bath time.

1420
01:31:39,662 --> 01:31:43,656
My great big beautiful girl.

1421
01:31:43,728 --> 01:31:44,785
You are so...

1422
01:31:46,223 --> 01:31:49,488
- Put her down, now.
- She needed help.

1423
01:31:49,552 --> 01:31:52,043
- Isn't that right, Rowena?
- Get out.

1424
01:31:52,495 --> 01:31:54,087
Oh, you better get out of here.

1425
01:31:54,224 --> 01:31:56,088
- You put that thing down.
- No, I mean it.

1426
01:31:56,207 --> 01:31:58,403
Put it down, now.

1427
01:31:58,736 --> 01:32:00,362
Do you hear me?

1428
01:32:03,215 --> 01:32:05,809
Are you okay, honey?
Are you okay?

1429
01:32:09,167 --> 01:32:10,135
Mommy, he's coming.

1430
01:32:10,991 --> 01:32:14,587
I said, get out. Get out.

1431
01:32:17,103 --> 01:32:19,367
She was blackmailing you,
wasn't she?

1432
01:32:19,471 --> 01:32:21,837
That's why you did her those favors
all those years...

1433
01:32:21,937 --> 01:32:24,531
...even after she slept
with your boyfriend.

1434
01:32:25,904 --> 01:32:28,668
You just couldn't say no, could you?

1435
01:32:30,479 --> 01:32:33,380
What was it?
What did Grace know about you?

1436
01:32:40,017 --> 01:32:42,450
We're just gonna tell people
he disappeared.

1437
01:32:42,544 --> 01:32:44,672
Like last August.

1438
01:32:45,040 --> 01:32:46,439
He just never came home.

1439
01:32:46,608 --> 01:32:50,305
He just went away
and he never came home.

1440
01:32:51,280 --> 01:32:52,713
You got that?

1441
01:32:52,848 --> 01:32:54,941
Rowena, look at me.

1442
01:32:55,056 --> 01:32:56,489
You got that?

1443
01:33:01,776 --> 01:33:03,870
God, you must have hated her.

1444
01:33:03,985 --> 01:33:07,080
I hated her. I hated her for you.

1445
01:33:08,241 --> 01:33:09,265
I still do.

1446
01:33:09,426 --> 01:33:10,392
- Rowena.
- Grace.

1447
01:33:10,547 --> 01:33:13,710
- She just kept coming back.
- You can't just forget people.

1448
01:33:13,778 --> 01:33:16,507
Bury them and pretend
like they never existed?

1449
01:33:17,073 --> 01:33:19,803
And then she handed you Hill
that night.

1450
01:33:20,146 --> 01:33:21,773
She fucking handed him to you.

1451
01:33:21,905 --> 01:33:22,998
Regards to your mother.

1452
01:33:25,169 --> 01:33:29,936
At some point, you must have thought,
"This has to end.

1453
01:33:30,033 --> 01:33:31,365
This all has to end."

1454
01:33:32,753 --> 01:33:36,450
So you did a little research.
You took the virtual tour.

1455
01:33:36,497 --> 01:33:39,261
That's how you found out about
the belladonna.

1456
01:33:39,347 --> 01:33:41,440
That's how you knew you could pin it
on Hill.

1457
01:33:42,994 --> 01:33:45,553
And then that's how
I knew it was you.

1458
01:33:46,067 --> 01:33:48,364
You remember that night
at my apartment?

1459
01:33:48,465 --> 01:33:50,433
When I was looking for Mia Hill 's
webpage...

1460
01:33:50,546 --> 01:33:53,242
...and your computer finished
the address for me.

1461
01:33:53,330 --> 01:33:54,991
Didn't register for me at the time.

1462
01:33:55,123 --> 01:33:58,716
It occurred to me that you already
had everything you needed to know.

1463
01:33:58,769 --> 01:34:02,536
- You led me right to him.
- Belladonna is used to dilate eyes.

1464
01:34:02,577 --> 01:34:05,809
- Are those planets?
- No, eyes.

1465
01:34:05,875 --> 01:34:08,901
Mrs. Hill did a whole series:
"Inside the Dilated Eye."

1466
01:34:08,978 --> 01:34:10,707
Every step of the fucking way.

1467
01:34:10,835 --> 01:34:14,634
And then, all you needed
was the belladonna.

1468
01:34:15,346 --> 01:34:17,678
And l- -
And I remembered your mother...

1469
01:34:17,778 --> 01:34:22,648
...and that pathetic little pharmacy
they have there...

1470
01:34:23,667 --> 01:34:26,692
...and how you always used to
complain how understaffed they were.

1471
01:34:26,770 --> 01:34:28,863
And it really wasn't that difficult
to get.

1472
01:34:29,202 --> 01:34:32,865
You called her to let her think
you were gonna do a story on Hill.

1473
01:34:32,915 --> 01:34:36,180
"Bring your computer," you said,
"show me everything you've got."

1474
01:34:36,243 --> 01:34:39,940
You laced her drink good enough
to knock her out. You got some hair.

1475
01:34:39,988 --> 01:34:41,215
You took some blood.

1476
01:34:41,362 --> 01:34:43,387
You placed the belladonna
in her eyes...

1477
01:34:43,506 --> 01:34:45,997
...to implicate Hill or his wife.

1478
01:34:48,147 --> 01:34:49,670
And then...

1479
01:34:50,131 --> 01:34:55,364
...all you needed to do was connect
Hill with the physical evidence.

1480
01:34:55,348 --> 01:34:58,214
You had the blood.
You had the fibers.

1481
01:34:59,506 --> 01:35:01,805
You even had the belladonna.

1482
01:35:02,739 --> 01:35:05,732
All the tumblers clicking into place.

1483
01:35:07,604 --> 01:35:09,765
Secrets are great, Ro.

1484
01:35:09,876 --> 01:35:12,035
Unless you get caught.

1485
01:35:14,100 --> 01:35:17,365
You once told me that all it takes
for the perfect murder...

1486
01:35:17,427 --> 01:35:20,794
...are the right ingredients
at the right time.

1487
01:35:25,204 --> 01:35:28,604
So you waited all these years
for everything to line up.

1488
01:35:34,771 --> 01:35:37,264
That's fucking beautiful.

1489
01:35:38,197 --> 01:35:40,164
That's poetic.

1490
01:35:45,075 --> 01:35:48,705
It's almost perfect
except for one little thing.

1491
01:35:56,020 --> 01:36:01,220
What are you willing to do for me
to keep me quiet?

1492
01:36:49,910 --> 01:36:53,276
Lieutenant Tejada,
it's Rowena Price.

1493
01:36:53,590 --> 01:36:56,786
I think we sent the wrong man
to prison. Miles attacked me.

1494
01:36:56,854 --> 01:36:59,344
You got to get to my house.

1495
01:36:59,446 --> 01:37:01,107
Please.

1496
01:38:04,703 --> 01:38:24,379
THE END
