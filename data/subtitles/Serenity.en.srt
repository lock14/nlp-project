<font color="#ff8000"><i>The central planets formed the Alliance.</i></font>

8
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,557
<font color="#ff8000"><i>Ruled by an interplanetary parliament,</i></font>

9
00:00:58,642 --> 00:01:01,101
<font color="#ff8000"><i>the Alliance was a beacon of civilization.</i></font>

10
00:01:02,271 --> 00:01:04,897
<font color="#ff8000"><i>The savage outer planets were

11
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,983
<font color="#ff8000"><i>and refused Alliance control.</i></font>

12
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,027
<font color="#ff8000"><i>The war was devastating.</i></font>

13
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:13,030
<font color="#ff8000"><i>But the Alliance's victory over
the Independents</i></font>

14
00:01:13,114 --> 00:01:14,990
<font color="#ff8000"><i>ensured a safer universe.</i></font>

15
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:17,367
And now, everyone can enjoy the comfort

16
00:01:17,453 --> 00:01:19,745
and enlightenment of true civilization.

17
00:01:20,414 --> 00:01:22,831
Why were the Independents even fighting us?

18
00:01:22,915 --> 00:01:24,876
Why wouldn't they look to be more civilized?

19
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,418
I hear they're cannibals.

20
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:27,545
That's only Reavers.

21
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:28,629
Reavers aren't real.

22
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:29,756
Full well they are.

23
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,632
I heard they attack settlers from space,

24
00:01:31,716 --> 00:01:33,134
and kill them, and wear their skins

25
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,093
and rape them for hours and hours...

26
00:01:37,805 --> 00:01:41,391
It's true that there are dangers
on the outer planets.

27
00:01:42,019 --> 00:01:43,978
So with so many social and
medical advancements

28
00:01:44,061 --> 00:01:46,146
we can bring to the Independents,

29
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:48,064
why would they fight so hard against us?

30
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,233
We meddle.

31
00:01:49,817 --> 00:01:50,817
River?

32
00:01:51,527 --> 00:01:53,570
People don't like to be meddled with.

33
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:55,781
We tell them what to do, what to think.

34
00:01:55,865 --> 00:01:57,450
Don't run, don't walk.

35
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:01,412
We're in their homes and in their heads
and we haven't the right.

36
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:02,871
We're meddlesome.

37
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:07,418
River, we're not telling people what to think,

38
00:02:08,086 --> 00:02:10,212
we're just trying to show them how.

39
00:02:11,924 --> 00:02:13,466
She's dreaming. Got that?

40
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:14,634
Off the charts.

41
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:16,218
Scary monsters.

42
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,346
Let's amp it up.
Delcium, eight drop.

43
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,808
See, most of our best work is done
when they're asleep.

44
00:02:22,893 --> 00:02:25,478
We can monitor
and direct their subconscious,

45
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:27,229
implant suggestions.

46
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:29,314
It's a little startling to see at first,

47
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,150
but the results are spectacular.

48
00:02:31,276 --> 00:02:34,554
Especially in this case.
River Tam is our star pupil.

49
00:02:34,737 --> 00:02:36,112
I've heard that.

50
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,074
She'll be ideal for defense deployment,

51
00:02:38,158 --> 00:02:39,950
even with the side effects.

52
00:02:40,409 --> 00:02:41,536
Tell me about them.

53
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:43,920
Well, obviously, she's unstable.

54
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,957
The neural stripping does tend to fragment

55
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,626
their own reality matrix.

56
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,043
It manifests as borderline...

57
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,587
What use do we have for a psychic
if she's insane?

58
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:54,298
She's not just a psychic.

59
00:02:54,383 --> 00:02:57,175
Given the right trigger,
this girl is a living weapon.

60
00:02:57,260 --> 00:03:00,146
She has her lucid periods.
We're hoping to improve upon the...

61
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:04,516
I'm sorry, sir, but I have to ask.

62
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,802
Is there a reason for this inspection?

63
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,104
Am I making you nervous?

64
00:03:09,605 --> 00:03:12,608
Key members of Parliament have personally
observed this subject.

65
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,568
I was told that the Alliance's support

66
00:03:14,652 --> 00:03:16,111
for the project was unanimous.

67
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,655
The demonstration of her powers...

68
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,574
How is she physically?

69
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:21,366
Like nothing we've seen.

70
00:03:22,286 --> 00:03:25,872
All our subjects are conditioned for combat,
but River,

71
00:03:26,956 --> 00:03:29,792
she's a creature of extraordinary grace.

72
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:31,836
Yes.

73
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,088
She always did love to dance.

74
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:41,304
River, it's Simon.

75
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:45,765
Please, it's Simon.

76
00:03:47,102 --> 00:03:48,402
It's your brother.

77
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,360
Simon.

78
00:03:59,865 --> 00:04:01,490
They know you've come.

79
00:04:06,622 --> 00:04:09,080
We can't make it
to the surface from the inside.

80
00:04:11,752 --> 00:04:12,901
Find out.

81
00:04:42,156 --> 00:04:46,369
A subject is loose, security breach.
Shaft 7.

82
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,178
Stop.

83
00:05:06,014 --> 00:05:07,112
Backtrack.

84
00:05:07,836 --> 00:05:08,915
Stop.

85
00:05:21,237 --> 00:05:22,487
Excuse me,

86
00:05:22,572 --> 00:05:24,632
no one is allowed in the records room

87
00:05:24,716 --> 00:05:26,067
without my express permission.

88
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,704
Forgive me, but I prefer
to see the event alone, without...

89
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:31,831
bias.

90
00:05:31,915 --> 00:05:33,074
I need to see your clearance.

91
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:35,209
And you are right to insist.

92
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,380
<i>Parliamentary override.
Full access.</i>

93
00:05:40,716 --> 00:05:41,798
Apologies.

94
00:05:41,882 --> 00:05:43,175
An operative of the Parliament

95
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,593
will, of course, have full cooperation.

96
00:05:46,053 --> 00:05:47,596
I'm not sure what...

97
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:51,182
I see no listing of rank or name.

98
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,350
I have neither.

99
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,271
Like this facility, I don't exist.

100
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,314
Let's talk about the Tams.

101
00:05:58,817 --> 00:06:00,358
I assume you've scanned the status logs...

102
00:06:00,444 --> 00:06:02,569
River was your greatest success.

103
00:06:02,894 --> 00:06:03,903
A prodigy.

104
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:06,072
A phenomenon.

105
00:06:06,283 --> 00:06:09,451
Until her brother walked in here
and took her from you.

106
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,036
It's not quite so simple.

107
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,329
I'm well aware of that.

108
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,694
There was no way that I could...

109
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,249
No. No. Of course.

110
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,750
The boy spent his entire fortune

111
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:19,045
developing the contacts
to infiltrate this place.

112
00:06:19,129 --> 00:06:21,713
Gave up a brilliant future
in medicine as well.

113
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:22,923
It's madness.

114
00:06:23,007 --> 00:06:24,050
Madness?

115
00:06:24,968 --> 00:06:27,536
Have you looked at this scan
carefully, Doctor?

116
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,014
At his face?

117
00:06:32,266 --> 00:06:35,560
It's love, in point of fact.

118
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,355
Something a good deal more dangerous.

119
00:06:38,523 --> 00:06:39,564
Why are you here?

120
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:42,798
Because the situation is even less simple,

121
00:06:43,223 --> 00:06:44,543
than you think.

122
00:06:45,654 --> 00:06:48,240
Do you know what your sin is, Doctor?

123
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:51,326
I wonder if...
It's pride.

124
00:06:56,875 --> 00:07:00,168
<i>Key members of Parliament
have personally observed this subject.</i>

125
00:07:00,377 --> 00:07:03,004
<i>I was told that the Alliance's support...</i>

126
00:07:03,423 --> 00:07:07,550
Key members of Parliament.

127
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,846
Key.

128
00:07:12,807 --> 00:07:15,100
The minds behind every military,

129
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:17,685
diplomatic, and covert operation

130
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:20,439
in the galaxy, and you put them

131
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:22,983
in a room with a psychic.

132
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:28,363
If there was some classified
information that she...

133
00:07:28,447 --> 00:07:30,406
She never spoke of it.
I don't know what it is.

134
00:07:30,492 --> 00:07:31,533
Nor do I.

135
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,576
And judging by her deteriorating
mental state,

136
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:34,870
I'd say we're both better off.

137
00:07:34,954 --> 00:07:37,622
Secrets are not my concern.

138
00:07:38,415 --> 00:07:40,793
Keeping them is.

139
00:07:41,877 --> 00:07:45,463
Whatever secrets she might have
accidentally gleaned,

140
00:07:45,548 --> 00:07:48,007
it's probable she doesn't even know
she knows them.

141
00:07:48,093 --> 00:07:50,845
That they're buried beneath layers
of psychosis.

142
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:55,807
You know, in certain older civilized cultures,

143
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,060
when men failed as entirely

144
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,646
as you have, they would throw themselves

145
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:01,939
on their swords.

146
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,608
Well, unfortunately,
I forgot to bring a sword.

147
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,531
I would put that down right now,
if I were you.

148
00:08:10,615 --> 00:08:13,701
Would you be killed in your sleep
like an ailing pet?

149
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,088
Young miss...

150
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:34,513
Young miss, I'll need all the logs on
behavioral modification triggers.

151
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,038
We'll have to reach out to River Tam

152
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:37,557
and help her to come back to us.

153
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,003
No matter how far out Simon has...

154
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:42,937
This is a good death.

155
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:47,317
There's no shame in this,

156
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:52,615
in a man's death.
A man who has done fine works.

157
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,868
We're making a better world.

158
00:08:58,413 --> 00:08:59,663
All of them,

159
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:02,957
better worlds.

160
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:11,466
Young miss,
I need you to go to work now.

161
00:09:12,092 --> 00:09:15,471
I think I may have a long way to travel.

162
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,788
Where are you hiding...

163
00:09:28,114 --> 00:09:29,366
little girl?

164
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:28,494
What was that?

165
00:10:28,577 --> 00:10:29,845
Did you see that?

166
00:10:33,549 --> 00:10:34,716
Was that the primary buffer panel?

167
00:10:34,801 --> 00:10:35,842
It did seem to resemble...

168
00:10:35,866 --> 00:10:37,048
Did the primary buffer panel

169
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,054
just fall off my gorramn ship for
no apparent reason?

170
00:10:42,057 --> 00:10:43,057
Looks like.

171
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,726
I thought Kaylee checked
the entry couplings.

172
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,854
I've a clear memory of it.
If she doesn't get us

173
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:49,188
extra flow from the engine room
to offset the burn-through,

174
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,075
this landing is gonna get pretty interesting.

175
00:10:51,109 --> 00:10:52,484
Define interesting.

176
00:10:52,568 --> 00:10:54,110
Oh, God, we're all gonna die?

177
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:58,823
This is the captain.
We have a little problem

178
00:10:58,908 --> 00:11:00,993
with our entry sequence,
so we may experience some

179
00:11:01,076 --> 00:11:03,470
slight turbulence and then explode.

180
00:11:03,495 --> 00:11:05,057
Can you shave the vector?
I'm doing it!

181
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,164
It's not enough.

182
00:11:06,249 --> 00:11:07,750
Just get us on the ground!

183
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:09,951
That part will happen pretty definitely.

184
00:11:11,086 --> 00:11:13,504
We're gonna explode?
I don't wanna explode.

185
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:15,173
Jayne, how many weapons
you plan on taking?

186
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:17,446
You only got two arms.
I just get excitable as to choice.

187
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:19,135
Like to have my options open.

188
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,513
I don't plan on any shooting taking
place during this job.

189
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,841
Yeah what you plan and what takes
place ain't ever exactly been similar.

190
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,302
No grenades.

191
00:11:26,626 --> 00:11:27,669
No grenades!

192
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:28,854
We crashing again?

193
00:11:28,937 --> 00:11:29,980
Talk to your husband.

194
00:11:30,065 --> 00:11:32,224
Mule prepped?
Good to go sir, just loading her up.

195
00:11:32,734 --> 00:11:34,650
Those grenades?
Yeah, Captain doesn't want them.

196
00:11:34,735 --> 00:11:37,129
Jayne, we're robbing the place.
We're not occupying it.

197
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:43,251
Kaylee!

198
00:11:46,789 --> 00:11:49,616
Kaylee, what in the sphincter
of hell are you playing at?

199
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,759
We got the primary buffer panel
coming right...

200
00:11:51,783 --> 00:11:53,596
Everything's shiny, Captain.
Not to fret.

201
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,466
You told me those entry couplings
would hold for another week!

202
00:11:57,549 --> 00:11:59,301
That was six months ago, Captain.

203
00:12:00,677 --> 00:12:01,928
My ship don't crash.

204
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:04,389
If she crashes, you crashed her.

205
00:12:06,942 --> 00:12:08,027
Doctor.

206
00:12:08,653 --> 00:12:11,134
Guess who needs to get innocked
before we hit planet-side.

207
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,232
Bit of a rockety ride.

208
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:15,525
Nothing to be worried about.

209
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:16,818
I'm not worried.

210
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,153
Fear is nothing to be ashamed of, Doctor.

211
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,532
This isn't fear.

212
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:21,948
This is anger.

213
00:12:22,866 --> 00:12:27,078
Well, kind of hard to tell one
from the other, face like yours.

214
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,331
Well, I imagine if it were fear,
my eyes would be wider.

215
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:32,250
I'll keep a lookout for that next time.

216
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:33,626
You're not taking her.

217
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,337
No, no, this is not a thing I'm interested
in talking over with...

218
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:38,923
She's not going with you, and that's final.

219
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:43,312
I hear the words that's final come out
your mouth ever again, they truly will be.

220
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:47,682
This boat is my home.
You all are guests on it.

221
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:49,308
Guests?

222
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:51,186
Now, I earned my passage, Captain...

223
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,730
And it's time your little sister learned
from your example.

224
00:12:53,815 --> 00:12:55,023
I have earned my passage...

225
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:59,778
treating bullet holes, knife wounds,
laser burns.

226
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:01,822
Some of our jobs are more
interesting than others.

227
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,904
And you want to put my sister
in the middle of that.

228
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:06,076
Didn't say want. Said will.

229
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,785
It's one job, Doc.
She'll be fine.

230
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,456
She's a 17-year-old girl.

231
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,124
A mentally traumatized 17...

232
00:13:12,207 --> 00:13:13,417
She's a reader.

233
00:13:13,835 --> 00:13:15,501
Sees into the truth of things.

234
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:18,429
Might see trouble before it's coming.
Which is of use to me.

235
00:13:18,715 --> 00:13:21,475
And that's your guiding star, isn't it?
What's of use.

236
00:13:22,677 --> 00:13:25,761
Honestly, Doctor,
I think we may really crash this time anyway.

237
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:28,474
Do you understand
what I have gone through

238
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:30,038
to keep River away from the Alliance?

239
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,100
I do.

240
00:13:31,261 --> 00:13:34,270
And it's a fact we here have been courteous
enough to keep to our own selves.

241
00:13:34,355 --> 00:13:35,480
Are you threatening to...

242
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,482
I look out for me and mine.

243
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,644
That don't include you less
I conjure it does.

244
00:13:41,528 --> 00:13:43,499
You stuck a thorn in the Alliance's paw.

245
00:13:43,624 --> 00:13:45,096
That tickles me a bit.

246
00:13:45,158 --> 00:13:47,533
But it also means I got to step twice
as fast to avoid them

247
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:50,077
and that means turning down plenty of jobs.

248
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,538
Even honest ones.

249
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:54,165
Put this crew together
with the promise of work,

250
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:56,501
which the Alliance makes harder every year.

251
00:13:56,586 --> 00:13:58,794
Come a day there won't be room
for naughty men like us

252
00:13:58,879 --> 00:14:00,422
to slip about at all.

253
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:01,777
This job goes south,

254
00:14:01,802 --> 00:14:03,698
there well may not be another.

255
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,369
So here is us,

256
00:14:05,394 --> 00:14:06,994
on the raggedy edge.

257
00:14:08,556 --> 00:14:09,772
Don't push me,

258
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:11,706
and I won't push you.

259
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,909
Zoe, Wash gonna straighten
this boat out before we get flattened?

260
00:14:29,994 --> 00:14:31,539
Like a downy feather, sir.

261
00:14:31,664 --> 00:14:33,562
No one flies like my mister.

262
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:43,798
River.

263
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:45,265
I know.

264
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:48,036
We're going for a ride.

265
00:15:07,407 --> 00:15:09,048
Hey, little one.

266
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:12,995
Understand your part in all this?

267
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,414
Do you?

268
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:19,960
This is what I do, darling.

269
00:15:23,630 --> 00:15:25,006
This is what I do.

270
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:29,010
Let's move, people.

271
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:32,722
Quit fiddling. Want the boat
running smooth when we get back.

272
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,057
Have faith, Captain.

273
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,475
Not today.

274
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,352
Pair of clips in the rear hatch.

275
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,889
We should hit town right
during Sunday worship.

276
00:15:42,274 --> 00:15:43,609
Won't be any crowds.

277
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:45,943
Well if Fanty and Mingo
are right about the payroll,

278
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,071
this could look to be a sunny day for us.

279
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:50,072
River, stay behind the others.

280
00:15:50,158 --> 00:15:52,900
If there's fighting,
drop to the floor or run away.

281
00:15:54,202 --> 00:15:56,203
It's okay to leave them to die.

282
00:15:56,538 --> 00:16:00,042
Doctor, I'm taking your sister
under my protection here.

283
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:02,636
If anything happens to her,
anything at all,

284
00:16:02,669 --> 00:16:05,547
I swear to you,
I will get very choked up.

285
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,332
Honestly, there could be tears.

286
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,187
Don't mind the Captain none, Simon.

287
00:16:18,513 --> 00:16:20,461
I know he'll look out for her.

288
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,315
They'll be back before you can spit.

289
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:28,445
Well, not that you spit.

290
00:16:34,409 --> 00:16:37,162
What are we hoping to find here
that equals the worth of a turd?

291
00:16:37,245 --> 00:16:40,039
Security payroll.
Alliance don't have the manpower

292
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:42,709
to enforce the peace on every outer-rim planet.

293
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:45,754
They hire out to the private firms,
who will not work for credit.

294
00:16:45,837 --> 00:16:49,508
They get paid in cashy money, which,
once a month, rests here.

295
00:16:49,591 --> 00:16:51,677
Don't that lead back to the Alliance, anyhow?

296
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:54,596
No private firm would ever report the theft
of their own payroll.

297
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:57,849
They'd appear weak,
might lose their contract.

298
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:00,011
Yeah, we're as ghosts in this.

299
00:17:00,037 --> 00:17:01,943
Won't but rattle the floor.

300
00:17:02,105 --> 00:17:04,690
Shiny. Let's be bad guys.

301
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,317
Hands and knees and heads bowed down!
Everybody, down!

302
00:17:18,621 --> 00:17:20,564
Looks like this is the place.

303
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:24,058
You all wanna be looking very intently
at your own belly buttons.

304
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:27,796
I see a head start to rise,
violence is going to ensue.

305
00:17:29,257 --> 00:17:30,882
Probably guessed we mean
to be thieving here,

306
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:33,134
but what we're after is not yours so...

307
00:17:33,885 --> 00:17:35,787
let's have no undue fussing.

308
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:37,972
She's locked up.

309
00:18:24,729 --> 00:18:27,189
Do you know what the definition
of a hero is?

310
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,107
Someone who gets other people killed.

311
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:32,152
You can look it up later.

312
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:37,124
Big happy family.

313
00:18:46,709 --> 00:18:50,211
At last, we can retire and give up
this life of crime.

314
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,760
Hey!

315
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,265
You all are Browncoats, eh?
Fought for independence?

316
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,392
Petty thieving ain't exactly soldiers work.

317
00:19:04,477 --> 00:19:06,798
War's long done.
We're all just folk now.

318
00:19:07,722 --> 00:19:08,796
Listen up!

319
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,148
We are coming down to empty that vault!

320
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:14,051
You have to give me
your authorization password!

321
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,281
Okay.

322
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,548
I'm telling you I heard it.
Repeater.

323
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,804
Did sound somewhat like gun blast.

324
00:19:37,827 --> 00:19:39,710
Maybe you ought run tell Lawman.

325
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:43,963
What the hell is up?

326
00:19:44,189 --> 00:19:45,374
You all right?

327
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,810
What's going on?

328
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,521
Reavers.

329
00:19:57,238 --> 00:20:00,865
The leg is good. It'll bleed plenty
and we avoid any necessary organs.

330
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,284
I was thinking more of a graze.

331
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:04,407
No, you don't want it
to look like you just gave up.

332
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,452
No, I get that.

333
00:20:05,538 --> 00:20:06,913
Mal!

334
00:20:06,998 --> 00:20:09,249
Every heist,
he's got to start yelling my name.

335
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:10,255
Mal!

336
00:20:10,779 --> 00:20:11,834
Reavers!

337
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,971
The girl's pitching a fit.
They're here or they're coming soon.

338
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:16,631
Get on the Mule.

339
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:18,909
What's that?
Does that lock from the inside?

340
00:20:18,932 --> 00:20:19,593
Yes.

341
00:20:19,594 --> 00:20:22,053
Get everyone upstairs.
You get them down here and you seal it.

342
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,230
As long as you got air, you don't open up,
you understand?

343
00:20:24,515 --> 00:20:25,414
But...

344
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,792
Get them inside the vault!

345
00:20:28,344 --> 00:20:29,894
You see them?

346
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:31,104
Zoe, take the wheel!

347
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:32,564
Anybody see them?

348
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,238
Take me with you!

349
00:20:40,323 --> 00:20:41,990
Get back in the vault with the others.

350
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:43,282
I can't stay here!
Please!

351
00:20:43,366 --> 00:20:44,992
It's too many.
Move ahead.

352
00:20:45,277 --> 00:20:46,382
Please!

353
00:20:49,205 --> 00:20:50,205
Please!

354
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:23,573
Faster! Faster!
Faster would be better!

355
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:34,260
How come they ain't blowing us out the air?

356
00:21:34,292 --> 00:21:37,170
They wanna run us down.
The up-close kill.

357
00:21:38,756 --> 00:21:40,965
They want us alive when they eat us.

358
00:21:41,424 --> 00:21:45,302
Boy, sure would be nice if we had
some grenades, don't you think?

359
00:21:46,931 --> 00:21:48,973
Wash, baby, can you hear me?

360
00:21:49,057 --> 00:21:50,099
We're moments from air.

361
00:21:50,183 --> 00:21:51,305
You got somebody behind you?

362
00:21:51,309 --> 00:21:52,477
Reavers.

363
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:55,814
Kaylee!

364
00:21:55,897 --> 00:21:56,981
Heat her up.
We got Reavers.

365
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,404
We're not gonna get to you in time.

366
00:22:03,489 --> 00:22:04,823
Keep moving, honey.

367
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,490
We're coming to you.

368
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
Where's my clips?

369
00:22:15,084 --> 00:22:16,209
Rear hatch.

370
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,137
Jayne!

371
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:33,183
I won't get ate!

372
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:36,709
You shoot me if they take me!

373
00:22:37,334 --> 00:22:39,064
Well, don't shoot me first!

374
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,711
Get some distance on them.

375
00:22:59,795 --> 00:23:02,630
You come to the flats,
I want you to swing round.

376
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,883
We're gonna try a Barn Swallow.

377
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,925
Simon! Open her up!

378
00:23:12,016 --> 00:23:13,474
They're closing on us!

379
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,769
Those rocks, give them a taste.

380
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:33,744
Okay, baby, we talked this through.

381
00:23:36,999 --> 00:23:38,374
Talking ain't doing.

382
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:20,541
River?

383
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:22,376
I swallowed a bug.

384
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,541
Are you okay?

385
00:24:28,925 --> 00:24:30,343
Is he okay?

386
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:45,825
<i>We all here?
What's going on?</i>

387
00:24:46,317 --> 00:24:47,609
Hello?

388
00:24:50,114 --> 00:24:51,405
No casualties.

389
00:24:51,699 --> 00:24:52,740
Anybody following?

390
00:24:52,825 --> 00:24:54,159
<i>Nice flying, baby.</i>

391
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,702
That's a negative.
Clean getaway.

392
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:58,699
Set course for Beaumonde.

393
00:24:58,923 --> 00:25:01,198
First thing, I want this body...

394
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:02,500
Simon!

395
00:25:05,503 --> 00:25:07,255
You son of a whore.
I'm a hair's breadth

396
00:25:07,338 --> 00:25:08,673
from riddling you with holes, Doctor.

397
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:10,842
One simple job!
She'll be fine!

398
00:25:10,925 --> 00:25:12,176
She is fine!

399
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,345
Except for being still crazy,
she's a picture of health!

400
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,685
Wasn't for River,
we'd probably be left there.

401
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:18,207
She felt them coming.

402
00:25:18,349 --> 00:25:20,434
Never again.
Do you understand me?

403
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,313
Seems I remember a talk about you
giving orders on my boat.

404
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,939
Well, we're off your boat.

405
00:25:25,023 --> 00:25:27,442
Just as soon as River gets her
share of the bounty.

406
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:28,942
Let's not do anything hasty...

407
00:25:28,943 --> 00:25:30,319
No, shiny!

408
00:25:30,613 --> 00:25:32,213
We'll be on Beaumonde in 10 hours' time,

409
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:35,115
you can pick up your earnings
and be on your merry.

410
00:25:35,409 --> 00:25:38,243
Meantime, you do your job.

411
00:25:39,121 --> 00:25:40,704
Patch up my crew.

412
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:44,666
He didn't lie down.

413
00:25:46,461 --> 00:25:48,128
They never lie down.

414
00:25:57,096 --> 00:25:59,265
No, I think things will glide
a deal smoother for us

415
00:25:59,349 --> 00:26:01,267
without River and Simon on board,

416
00:26:01,352 --> 00:26:03,269
but how long do you think they'll last?

417
00:26:03,354 --> 00:26:04,394
Doc made his call.

418
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:05,480
Yeah.

419
00:26:05,564 --> 00:26:07,397
They's as babes in a basket
when we took them in.

420
00:26:07,482 --> 00:26:09,275
We sheltered them plenty.

421
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:12,694
Man has to cut loose,
learn to stand on his own.

422
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,365
Like that man back in town?

423
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:20,744
I had to shoot him.

424
00:26:20,828 --> 00:26:22,747
What the Reavers would've done
to him before they killed him...

425
00:26:22,830 --> 00:26:25,250
I know.
That was a piece of mercy.

426
00:26:26,251 --> 00:26:29,211
But before that, him begging us
to bring him along.

427
00:26:30,381 --> 00:26:33,258
We couldn't take the weight.
Would've slowed us down.

428
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:34,759
You know that for certain?

429
00:26:34,843 --> 00:26:36,677
Mule won't run with five.

430
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:40,856
I should've dumped the girl?
Or you? Or Jayne?

431
00:26:41,224 --> 00:26:42,517
Oh, Jayne...

432
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:44,935
You could've tossed the payload.

433
00:26:45,019 --> 00:26:46,311
Tossed the...

434
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:51,233
Zoe, I got bits falling off my ship,
I got a crew ain't been paid,

435
00:26:51,317 --> 00:26:54,278
and, oh, yeah, a powerful need to eat
sometime this month.

436
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:56,458
We tell Fanty and Mingo
we skunked the job,

437
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,432
what do think they'll do to us?

438
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,287
We're close to gone out here.

439
00:27:03,454 --> 00:27:05,873
We get a job, we got to make good.

440
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,085
Sir, I don't disagree on any particular point.

441
00:27:10,837 --> 00:27:12,005
It's just,

442
00:27:15,217 --> 00:27:18,428
in the time of war, we would've never
left a man stranded.

443
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:21,556
Maybe that's why we lost.

444
00:27:30,941 --> 00:27:32,607
That was close.

445
00:27:34,944 --> 00:27:36,320
I do not get it.

446
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:38,990
How's a guy get so wrong?

447
00:27:39,074 --> 00:27:40,863
Cutting on his own face,

448
00:27:41,087 --> 00:27:42,800
raping and murdering.

449
00:27:45,455 --> 00:27:47,457
I'll kill a man in a fair fight,

450
00:27:48,250 --> 00:27:50,751
or if I think he's gonna start a fair fight,

451
00:27:51,627 --> 00:27:53,076
or if he bothers me,

452
00:27:53,301 --> 00:27:54,997
or if there's a woman,

453
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,277
or if I'm getting paid.

454
00:27:58,402 --> 00:28:00,251
Mostly only when I'm getting paid.

455
00:28:01,596 --> 00:28:04,106
These Reavers, the last 10 years,

456
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,826
they show up like
the bogeyman from stories.

457
00:28:08,228 --> 00:28:09,660
Eating people alive?

458
00:28:10,184 --> 00:28:11,645
Where does that get fun?

459
00:28:13,107 --> 00:28:15,442
Shepherd Book said they was men who just

460
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,228
reached the edge of space,

461
00:28:17,553 --> 00:28:20,647
saw a vasty nothingness
and went bibbledy over it.

462
00:28:21,075 --> 00:28:22,075
Oh, hell.

463
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,452
I've been to the edge.

464
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,198
Just looked like...

465
00:28:28,522 --> 00:28:29,823
more space.

466
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,376
I don't know.

467
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:34,836
It can get awful lonely in the black.

468
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,632
Like to get addlepated ourselves,

469
00:28:37,715 --> 00:28:39,634
we stay on this boat much longer.

470
00:28:40,344 --> 00:28:42,845
Captain will drive us all off, one by one.

471
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:45,515
Just like Simon and River.

472
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,768
Just like Inara.

473
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:52,896
<i>Kaylee, are you ever going
to put that capture down?</i>

474
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,525
<i>We got to have records of everything, Inara.</i>

475
00:28:55,608 --> 00:28:59,487
<i>A bona fide companion entertained clients
on this very ship.</i>

476
00:28:59,988 --> 00:29:01,489
<i>In this very bed.</i>

477
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,365
<i>Well, I can't do my work here.</i>

478
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,451
<i>And I don't think the Captain approves.</i>

479
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:07,119
<i>The Captain wants you to stay...</i>

480
00:29:07,203 --> 00:29:10,580
<i>That man doesn't know what he wants.
I don't have time to...</i>

481
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:47,285
Don't talk to the barkers, talk to the captains.

482
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:50,746
You look the captain in the eye.
Know who you're dealing with.

483
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:52,874
I wish there was...

484
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:58,145
You shouldn't ought to be so clean.

485
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,866
It's a dead giveaway you don't belong,
you always got to be tidy.

486
00:30:02,550 --> 00:30:04,469
Don't pay anybody in advance.

487
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,597
And don't ride in anything with
a Capissen 38 engine,

488
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:10,482
they fall right out of the sky.

489
00:30:11,393 --> 00:30:12,527
Kaylee.

490
00:30:24,155 --> 00:30:26,365
River, do you want to stay with them?

491
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,576
It isn't safe.

492
00:30:31,288 --> 00:30:32,288
No.

493
00:30:34,583 --> 00:30:36,709
I fear it isn't safe anymore.

494
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:40,421
For them.

495
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:06,239
Kaylee, this is a place of business.
We can talk about Simon when...

496
00:31:06,323 --> 00:31:07,781
When he's four worlds away?

497
00:31:07,865 --> 00:31:10,201
Or the Alliance gets
a hold of him and River?

498
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:11,362
That ain't my worry.

499
00:31:11,386 --> 00:31:13,728
I got to finish this job
and get us another one.

500
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,623
Can't do that carrying those two.

501
00:31:15,999 --> 00:31:17,875
How can you be so cold?

502
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:20,126
Captain didn't make them fugitives.

503
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,320
But he could have made them family.

504
00:31:22,588 --> 00:31:25,383
Instead of keeping Simon
from seeing I was there.

505
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,911
When I carried such a torch,
when we could've...

506
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:32,390
Going on a year now,
I ain't had nothing twixt my nethers

507
00:31:32,413 --> 00:31:33,857
weren't run on batteries.

508
00:31:34,142 --> 00:31:36,352
God! I can't know that!

509
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,604
I could stand to hear a little more.

510
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:40,897
If you had a care for anybody's heart...

511
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,607
You knew he was gonna leave.

512
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,493
We never been
but a way station to those two.

513
00:31:44,569 --> 00:31:46,194
And how do you know what he feels?

514
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:49,240
He's got River to worry on,
but he still could've shown you...

515
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,576
If I truly wanted someone bad enough,

516
00:31:51,660 --> 00:31:54,145
wouldn't be a thing in the 'verse
could stop me from going to her.

517
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,315
Tell that to Inara.

518
00:32:02,003 --> 00:32:03,722
Domestic troubles?

519
00:32:04,146 --> 00:32:05,846
Domestic troubles?

520
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:09,093
'Cause we don't wanna interrupt.

521
00:32:09,176 --> 00:32:10,944
A man should keep his house in order.

522
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:12,930
Fanty. Mingo.

523
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:14,056
He's Mingo.

524
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:15,266
He's Fanty.
You're Mingo.

525
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,059
How is it you always know?

526
00:32:18,144 --> 00:32:19,444
Fanty's prettier.

527
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,730
Feel to do some business?

528
00:32:28,696 --> 00:32:29,696
Endeavors.

529
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,707
Quite a crew you've got.

530
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,834
Yeah, they're a fine bunch of Reubens.

531
00:32:41,917 --> 00:32:43,608
How you keep them
on that crap boat,

532
00:32:43,634 --> 00:32:46,172
is the subject of much
musing between me and Fanty.

533
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:47,298
We go on and on.

534
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:48,590
So I'm noticing.

535
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:51,801
Is there a problem we don't know of?

536
00:32:52,554 --> 00:32:54,115
You got a sweet take kissing your foot.

537
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:57,223
How's about you take your 25%,
we can talk about the next job?

538
00:32:57,308 --> 00:32:59,309
Well, our end is 40, precious.

539
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,269
My muscular buttocks it's 40.

540
00:33:01,355 --> 00:33:02,355
It is...

541
00:33:02,730 --> 00:33:04,190
as of now.

542
00:33:04,732 --> 00:33:06,358
Find anyone around going cheaper...

543
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:08,653
Find anyone around going near

544
00:33:08,737 --> 00:33:11,196
a sorry lot like you in the first instance.

545
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,031
You're unpredictable, Mal.

546
00:33:13,115 --> 00:33:15,076
You run when you ought to fight.

547
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,077
Fight when you ought to deal.

548
00:33:17,371 --> 00:33:19,413
Makes a business person a little twitchy.

549
00:33:55,951 --> 00:33:57,284
Miranda.

550
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:25,353
Hey!
A tussle!

551
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:26,713
Jayne.

552
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:46,967
Do you know that girl?

553
00:34:47,501 --> 00:34:49,128
I really don't.

554
00:35:09,565 --> 00:35:11,233
Gorrammit, girl, it's me!

555
00:36:58,717 --> 00:36:59,800
May I see her?

556
00:36:59,885 --> 00:37:02,385
I believe you've got some story
telling to do.

557
00:37:02,469 --> 00:37:04,471
What in the hell happened back there?

558
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:07,391
Start with the part where Jayne gets
knocked out by a 90-pound girl.

559
00:37:07,474 --> 00:37:10,101
'Cause I don't think
that's ever getting old.

560
00:37:10,561 --> 00:37:12,478
Do we know if anyone was killed?

561
00:37:12,563 --> 00:37:13,606
It's likely.

562
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:16,483
I know she meant to kill me
before the Doc put her out.

563
00:37:16,568 --> 00:37:19,068
Which, how exactly does that
work anyhow?

564
00:37:20,614 --> 00:37:21,989
It's a safe word.

565
00:37:23,449 --> 00:37:25,576
The people who helped me break River out

566
00:37:25,659 --> 00:37:27,994
had Intel that River
and the other subjects were being

567
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,331
embedded with behavioral conditioning.

568
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:32,373
They taught me a safe word,

569
00:37:32,583 --> 00:37:33,958
in case something happened.

570
00:37:34,043 --> 00:37:35,501
Not sure I get it.

571
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:38,380
It's a phrase that makes her fall asleep.

572
00:37:38,672 --> 00:37:40,340
If I speak the words...

573
00:37:40,425 --> 00:37:41,842
Don't say it!

574
00:37:42,052 --> 00:37:43,969
It only works on her, Jayne.

575
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:47,681
Well, now I know that.

576
00:37:47,806 --> 00:37:49,934
In case something happened.

577
00:37:50,351 --> 00:37:52,603
You feel to elaborate on what that
something might be?

578
00:37:52,686 --> 00:37:53,686
They never said what...

579
00:37:53,771 --> 00:37:55,396
And you never did ask.

580
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,108
Get your hands off...

581
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:00,818
Eight months.
Eight months, you had her on my boat,

582
00:38:00,903 --> 00:38:02,505
knowing full well she could go monkeyshit

583
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:03,989
at the wrong word.
You never said a thing.

584
00:38:04,074 --> 00:38:06,951
I brought her out here
so they couldn't get to her.

585
00:38:07,452 --> 00:38:08,452
I don't even know what they...

586
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,827
My ship!

587
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:11,121
My crew!

588
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,291
You had a gorramn time bomb living with us!

589
00:38:15,543 --> 00:38:18,086
Who we gonna find in
there when she wakes up?

590
00:38:19,255 --> 00:38:20,255
The girl?

591
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,340
Or the weapon?

592
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,969
I thought she was getting better.

593
00:38:25,052 --> 00:38:27,096
And I thought they was getting off!

594
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:32,893
Didn't we have an intricate plan how
they was gonna be not here anymore?

595
00:38:33,018 --> 00:38:34,811
We couldn't leave them now.

596
00:38:34,896 --> 00:38:36,063
No, now that...

597
00:38:36,313 --> 00:38:40,567
she's a killer woman, we ought be
bringing her tea and dumplings.

598
00:38:41,568 --> 00:38:44,112
In earnest, Mal,
why'd you bring her back on?

599
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:51,452
May I see her?

600
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:04,632
She goes woolly again,
we're gonna have to put a bullet to her.

601
00:39:05,217 --> 00:39:06,719
It's crossed my mind.

602
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:09,847
Can I make a suggestion that
doesn't involve violence,

603
00:39:09,931 --> 00:39:11,014
or is this the wrong crowd?

604
00:39:11,099 --> 00:39:12,141
Honey.

605
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:14,518
We're flying a lot blinder than usual here.

606
00:39:14,601 --> 00:39:16,237
We need to get our bearings.

607
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:19,273
I think we need to talk to Mr. Universe.

608
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:47,675
Oh, this is good, this is good.

609
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:53,347
You guys always bring me
the very best violence.

610
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,516
<i>You think you're in a hot place?</i>

611
00:39:55,601 --> 00:39:57,001
<i>That's what we're looking to learn.</i>

612
00:39:57,061 --> 00:39:59,063
<i>Is there any follow up, a newswave?</i>

613
00:39:59,146 --> 00:40:00,458
There is no news.

614
00:40:00,784 --> 00:40:02,606
There's the truth of the signal.

615
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:03,876
What I see.

616
00:40:03,902 --> 00:40:06,693
And there's the puppet theater

617
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,989
the Parliament jesters foist
on the somnambulant public.

618
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:13,409
Well, what about this?
Did this make the puppet theater?

619
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,746
<i>No, sir.
And no law force flags, either.</i>

620
00:40:15,829 --> 00:40:17,789
<i>I had to go into the security feed direct.</i>

621
00:40:17,873 --> 00:40:18,998
You can do that?

622
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,793
Can't stop the signal, Mal.

623
00:40:21,503 --> 00:40:24,338
<i>Everything goes somewhere,
and I go everywhere.</i>

624
00:40:24,505 --> 00:40:26,422
<i>Security feeds are a traipse to access,</i>

625
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,175
<i>and I wasn't the first one in.</i>

626
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,885
<i>This has prints on it.</i>

627
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,552
So somebody else has been fed this.

628
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:35,516
<i>Zoe, you sultry minx,
stop falling in love with me.</i>

629
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,476
<i>You're just gonna embarrass yourself.</i>

630
00:40:37,559 --> 00:40:40,019
<i>I have a commitment to my Lovebot.</i>

631
00:40:42,565 --> 00:40:46,485
It was a very beautiful ceremony.
Lenore wrote her own vows,

632
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:50,530
I cried like a baby, a hungry, angry baby.

633
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:57,411
And she falls asleep.
Which, she would be sleepy.

634
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:58,871
Can you go back?

635
00:40:58,956 --> 00:41:00,791
See if anybody spoke with her
before she acted up.

636
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,701
Made any kind of contact with her.

637
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:07,255
<i>Miranda.</i>

638
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:08,798
Miranda?

639
00:41:11,219 --> 00:41:12,536
Go back further.

640
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,137
No.

641
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:17,599
Please.

642
00:41:22,063 --> 00:41:25,190
Mal, you're very smart.

643
00:41:25,567 --> 00:41:27,317
Someone is talking to her.

644
00:41:27,402 --> 00:41:28,902
The oaty bar?

645
00:41:31,905 --> 00:41:33,072
Subliminal.

646
00:41:34,117 --> 00:41:36,742
It's a subliminal message,
broadwaved to trigger her.

647
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:40,204
I've been seeing this code pop up
all over the last few weeks.

648
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:43,208
It's Alliance and it's high military.

649
00:41:44,168 --> 00:41:48,672
<i>They have gone to enormous trouble
to find your little friend.</i>

650
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,592
<i>And found her, they have.</i>

651
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,596
<i>Do you all know what it is you're carrying?</i>

652
00:42:03,438 --> 00:42:04,938
They're afraid of me.

653
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:07,666
I'm sorry.

654
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,400
They should be.

655
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:12,206
But I'll show them.

656
00:42:12,931 --> 00:42:14,137
Oh, God.

657
00:42:15,617 --> 00:42:16,675
It's okay.

658
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:18,768
Hey, it's okay.

659
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,289
Show me off like a dog.

660
00:42:23,458 --> 00:42:24,958
Old men covered in blood.

661
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:27,835
It never touched them,
but they're drowning in it.

662
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:30,994
I don't know what I'm saying.

663
00:42:31,018 --> 00:42:32,697
I never know what I'm saying.

664
00:42:35,802 --> 00:42:38,096
In the Maidenhead, you said something.

665
00:42:39,139 --> 00:42:41,391
When you were triggered,
do you remember?

666
00:42:41,476 --> 00:42:44,143
The Captain saw you say something
on the feed.

667
00:42:45,855 --> 00:42:46,974
Miranda.

668
00:42:48,599 --> 00:42:49,599
Miranda.

669
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,119
Ask her.

670
00:42:55,405 --> 00:42:57,056
Who is Miranda?

671
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,664
Am I talking to Miranda now?

672
00:43:07,626 --> 00:43:08,626
No.

673
00:43:10,505 --> 00:43:11,588
Not right.

674
00:43:14,467 --> 00:43:18,427
But I think when they triggered you,

675
00:43:19,264 --> 00:43:21,222
it somehow brought this up.

676
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:22,556
This memory.

677
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:23,849
It isn't mine.

678
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:25,851
The memory, it isn't mine.

679
00:43:25,936 --> 00:43:28,655
And I shouldn't have to carry it.
It isn't mine.

680
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:30,690
Don't make me sleep again.

681
00:43:30,775 --> 00:43:31,960
I won't.

682
00:43:34,152 --> 00:43:35,695
Put a bullet to me.

683
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:39,282
Bullet in the brainpan, squish.

684
00:43:41,369 --> 00:43:42,708
Don't say that.

685
00:43:42,932 --> 00:43:44,061
Not ever.

686
00:43:46,666 --> 00:43:48,333
We'll get through this.

687
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,880
Things are going to get much,
much worse.

688
00:44:47,893 --> 00:44:49,887
Thanks for taking us in again, Shepherd.

689
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,188
You got a plan?

690
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:54,273
Hiding ain't a plan?

691
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:56,025
It'll do you for a spell.

692
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:58,195
And the folks here'll be glad
of the extra coin.

693
00:44:58,278 --> 00:44:59,822
But the Alliance will be coming.

694
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:03,115
They're after this girl with a powerful will.

695
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,387
I look to hear the tromp of their boots
any moment.

696
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,498
You won't.

697
00:45:12,918 --> 00:45:15,628
This isn't a palms-up military run, Mal.

698
00:45:17,090 --> 00:45:18,798
No reports broadwaved,

699
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:20,717
no warrants.

700
00:45:21,177 --> 00:45:23,594
Much as they want her,
they want her hid.

701
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:26,097
That means closed file.

702
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:28,474
Means an operative.

703
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:31,460
Which is trouble you've not known.

704
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,657
I could have left her there.

705
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:39,485
I had an out.

706
00:45:40,278 --> 00:45:42,405
Hell, I had every reason in the 'verse

707
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:44,458
to leave her lay and haul anchor.

708
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:47,327
It's not your way, Mal.

709
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:50,121
I have a way?

710
00:45:51,164 --> 00:45:52,833
That better than a plan?

711
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:56,670
Only one thing is gonna walk you
through this, Mal.

712
00:45:58,630 --> 00:45:59,630
Belief.

713
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,717
You know I always look to you for counsel,

714
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,811
but sermons make me sleepy, Shepherd.

715
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:09,056
I ain't looking for help from on high.

716
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:12,476
That's a long wait for a train don't come.

717
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:13,900
When I talk about belief,

718
00:46:13,925 --> 00:46:16,547
why do you always assume
I'm talking about God?

719
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:24,697
They'll come at you sideways.

720
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:27,951
It's how they think.
It's how they move.

721
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,695
Sidle up and smile.

722
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:32,880
Hit you where you're weak.

723
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:37,543
Sort of man they're like
to send believes hard.

724
00:46:38,713 --> 00:46:40,755
Kills and never asks why.

725
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:48,637
It's of interest to me how much you seem
to know about that world.

726
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:50,891
I wasn't born a Shepherd, Mal.

727
00:46:50,974 --> 00:46:52,826
Have to tell me about that sometime.

728
00:46:55,103 --> 00:46:56,346
No, I don't.

729
00:47:00,443 --> 00:47:01,610
<i>River?</i>

730
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,487
<i>River, you look tired.</i>

731
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:08,574
<i>I think everybody's a little tired by now.
Why don't we all lie down?</i>

732
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:12,579
<i>A little peace and quiet will make
everything better.</i>

733
00:47:12,746 --> 00:47:14,164
<i>River.
Do as you're told.</i>

734
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:15,289
<i>No.</i>

735
00:47:15,373 --> 00:47:17,333
<i>It's going to be fine.
Lie down.</i>

736
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:18,418
<i>No.</i>

737
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,590
<i>Cut them down.</i>

738
00:47:27,344 --> 00:47:28,344
What?

739
00:47:28,429 --> 00:47:30,262
<i>Mal!
You up?</i>

740
00:47:31,097 --> 00:47:33,367
<i>I got a wave.
I'm gonna bounce it down to you.</i>

741
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,190
Inara.

742
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,943
<i>I...
Is this a bad time?</i>

743
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:45,987
No, it's...

744
00:47:46,614 --> 00:47:47,780
good as any.

745
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,324
How's your world?

746
00:47:49,407 --> 00:47:50,992
<i>Cold. It's autumn here.</i>

747
00:47:51,494 --> 00:47:53,327
Still at the Training House?

748
00:47:57,291 --> 00:48:01,460
So, what occasions the wave?
Not that to see you ain't...

749
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:05,005
Well, you look very fine.

750
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:06,423
<i>Oh. Thank you.</i>

751
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,592
<i>So, what was the...</i>

752
00:48:11,012 --> 00:48:14,266
<i>I guess we're having something of
a problem here with the locals.</i>

753
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:15,391
<i>And, I thought maybe...</i>

754
00:48:15,476 --> 00:48:16,976
You could use a gun hand?

755
00:48:17,061 --> 00:48:18,793
<i>I'm hoping not, but...</i>

756
00:48:19,318 --> 00:48:21,355
<i>if you happen to be close at all, you...</i>

757
00:48:21,556 --> 00:48:24,226
<i>The crew could take your
ease here for a while.</i>

758
00:48:24,251 --> 00:48:25,583
<i>And there'd be payment.</i>

759
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:29,338
Well, it would be...

760
00:48:29,563 --> 00:48:31,264
I mean, I'd like to.

761
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:38,081
Kaylee's been missing you something fierce.

762
00:48:38,164 --> 00:48:39,833
Oh, man.
<i>I miss her, too.</i>

763
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:42,001
<i>I even miss my shuttle, occasionally.</i>

764
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:43,670
Yeah, you left...

765
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:46,255
Got some of your stuff in a trunk.

766
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,940
I never did get a chance to drop it off.

767
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:50,010
<i>I didn't...
I didn't mean to leave stuff.</i>

768
00:48:50,094 --> 00:48:52,219
I didn't look through the stuff.

769
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:53,469
I just...

770
00:48:54,195 --> 00:48:55,748
Just sundries, I expect.

771
00:48:58,643 --> 00:49:01,438
So I'll send you a wave, soon as I can.

772
00:49:02,188 --> 00:49:03,356
<i>Thank you.</i>

773
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:15,201
Inara, nice to see her again.

774
00:49:17,163 --> 00:49:18,771
So, trap?

775
00:49:18,956 --> 00:49:19,956
Trap.

776
00:49:20,041 --> 00:49:21,206
We going in?

777
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,708
Only but a few hours out.

778
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:26,338
Yeah, but, remember the part
where it's a trap?

779
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:28,965
If that's the case,
then Inara's already caught in it.

780
00:49:29,050 --> 00:49:31,050
She wouldn't set us up willing.

781
00:49:31,260 --> 00:49:34,137
Might be we got a shot at seeing who's
turning these wheels.

782
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:35,221
We go in.

783
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:38,641
But how can you be sure Inara
don't just wanna see you?

784
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:41,978
Sometimes people have feelings.

785
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:44,188
I'm referring here to people.

786
00:49:45,940 --> 00:49:48,068
You all were watching, I take it.

787
00:49:49,737 --> 00:49:50,737
Yes.

788
00:49:50,820 --> 00:49:51,820
Did you see us fight?

789
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:52,905
No.

790
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:54,074
Trap.

791
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:05,335
We're about 70 miles from the Training House,
and nobody on radar.

792
00:50:05,418 --> 00:50:07,836
If the Alliance is about, they're laying low.

793
00:50:07,922 --> 00:50:09,088
They're about.

794
00:50:09,172 --> 00:50:11,173
Find us a home.
I'll take the shuttle a little closer.

795
00:50:11,257 --> 00:50:12,925
Zoe, ship is yours.

796
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:15,512
Remember.
If anything happens to me,

797
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:17,356
or if you don't hear from me within the hour,

798
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:19,682
you take this ship and you come
and you rescue me.

799
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:20,766
What?

800
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,768
Risk my ship?

801
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,019
I mean it.

802
00:50:24,105 --> 00:50:26,255
It's cold out there.
And I don't wanna get left.

803
00:50:43,708 --> 00:50:47,043
Dear Buddha, please bring me a pony,
and a plastic rocket, and...

804
00:50:47,128 --> 00:50:49,045
Mal!
What are you doing here?

805
00:50:49,630 --> 00:50:50,838
Well, you invited me.

806
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:53,465
I never thought for a second
you'd be stupid enough to come.

807
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:55,385
Well, that makes you kind of a tease,
doesn't it?

808
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,387
You knew my invitation wasn't on the level.

809
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:00,431
Which led me to conclude that
you must be in some trouble.

810
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:02,266
I'm fine.
I'm giddy.

811
00:51:02,351 --> 00:51:04,768
For a woman schooled in telling a man
what he wants to hear,

812
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,128
you ain't much of a liar.

813
00:51:06,152 --> 00:51:08,356
Mal, you cannot handle this man.

814
00:51:14,447 --> 00:51:15,572
I have to say, Captain,

815
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:18,532
I'm impressed that you would come
for her yourself.

816
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:21,952
And that you would make it this far,
in that outfit.

817
00:51:23,164 --> 00:51:25,414
I can be very graceful when I need to.

818
00:51:25,498 --> 00:51:26,875
I've no doubt.

819
00:51:28,293 --> 00:51:29,293
What are you doing?

820
00:51:29,378 --> 00:51:31,003
I'm praying for you, Mal.

821
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:33,505
She's very thoughtful.

822
00:51:33,923 --> 00:51:36,885
But I mean it when I say
I've no intent to harm you.

823
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:39,304
Speak your piece.

824
00:51:39,764 --> 00:51:41,597
I think you're beginning to understand

825
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:43,641
how dangerous River Tam is.

826
00:51:44,018 --> 00:51:45,851
She is a mite unpredictable.

827
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,978
Mood swings, of a sort.

828
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:49,355
It's worse than you know.

829
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,606
It usually is.

830
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:54,318
That girl will rain destruction down on
you and your ship.

831
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:58,489
She is an albatross, Captain.

832
00:51:58,615 --> 00:52:00,365
Way I remember it,

833
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:03,827
albatross was a ship's good luck,
till some idiot killed it.

834
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:07,039
Yes, I've read a poem.
Try not to faint.

835
00:52:07,583 --> 00:52:09,416
I've seen your war record.

836
00:52:10,376 --> 00:52:12,961
I know how you must feel
about the Alliance.

837
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,297
You really don't.

838
00:52:14,380 --> 00:52:15,422
Fair to say.

839
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:18,967
But I have to hope you understand,
you can't beat us.

840
00:52:19,052 --> 00:52:20,804
I got no need to beat you.

841
00:52:20,887 --> 00:52:22,137
I just want to go my way.

842
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,722
And you can do that,

843
00:52:24,557 --> 00:52:27,601
once you let me take River Tam
back home.

844
00:52:31,315 --> 00:52:33,858
No, no.
You're working this deal all crabbed.

845
00:52:33,943 --> 00:52:35,275
You got to open with payment.

846
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:36,652
That is a trap.

847
00:52:36,737 --> 00:52:40,322
I offer money, you'll play the man of honor
and take umbrage.

848
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:43,159
I ask you to do what is right,
you'll play the brigand.

849
00:52:43,244 --> 00:52:45,744
I have no stomach for games.

850
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:48,289
I already know you will not see reason.

851
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:49,974
The Alliance wanted to show me a reason,

852
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,210
they shouldn't have sent an assassin.

853
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:01,552
I have a warship in deep orbit, Captain.

854
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:05,764
We locked on to Serenity's pulse beacon
the moment you hit atmo.

855
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:07,851
I can speak a word and send a missile

856
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:10,686
to that exact location inside of three minutes.

857
00:53:10,771 --> 00:53:11,938
You do that,

858
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:15,900
you'd best make peace
with your dear and fluffy lord.

859
00:53:19,655 --> 00:53:20,905
Pulse beacon.

860
00:53:21,155 --> 00:53:25,117
Advice from an old tracker.
You want to find someone, use your eyes.

861
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,871
How long do you think you can
really run from us?

862
00:53:27,954 --> 00:53:30,539
I never credited the Alliance with
an overabundance of brains.

863
00:53:30,623 --> 00:53:31,666
And if you're the best they got...

864
00:53:31,750 --> 00:53:32,876
Captain Reynolds,

865
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,711
I should tell you,
so that you don't waste your time,

866
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:38,172
you can't make me angry.

867
00:53:38,257 --> 00:53:39,798
Please, spend an hour with him.

868
00:53:40,509 --> 00:53:43,302
I want to resolve this like civilized men.

869
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,306
I'm not threatening you.

870
00:53:46,639 --> 00:53:48,141
I'm unarmed. Good.

871
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:55,273
I am, of course, wearing full body armor.

872
00:53:55,356 --> 00:53:56,398
I am not a moron.

873
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:57,692
Wait, just let...

874
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:27,387
What, no backup?

875
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:29,181
Making an awful ruckus.

876
00:54:29,266 --> 00:54:31,000
They'll come when they're needed.

877
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:32,601
I'd start whistling.

878
00:54:32,728 --> 00:54:35,896
Captain, what do you think
is going to happen here?

879
00:55:22,735 --> 00:55:24,719
Nothing here is what it seems.

880
00:55:25,043 --> 00:55:27,097
He isn't the plucky hero.

881
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:31,869
The Alliance isn't some evil empire.
This is not the grand arena.

882
00:55:32,079 --> 00:55:33,746
And that's not incense.

883
00:55:40,753 --> 00:55:41,920
Sir, can you hear me?

884
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:44,548
Just a flash bomb.
Go. Go!

885
00:55:50,264 --> 00:55:51,764
What have you done to my shuttle?

886
00:55:51,849 --> 00:55:53,273
It's not your shuttle.

887
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:55,527
Head east. Keep her low.

888
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:13,369
Okay, forget the pulse beacon.

889
00:56:13,454 --> 00:56:15,579
<i>There must be another way
to track the ship.</i>

890
00:56:15,664 --> 00:56:17,039
Get a read on the nav. sat.

891
00:56:17,123 --> 00:56:19,708
It's a registered transport,
you must be able to locate.

892
00:56:19,793 --> 00:56:20,751
<i>Sir?</i>

893
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:22,711
Yes, have you found a nav. sat. trajectory?

894
00:56:22,795 --> 00:56:25,213
<i>Sir, we found seven.</i>

895
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:34,639
We've every reason to be afraid.

896
00:56:35,099 --> 00:56:38,061
Why, 'cause this guy beat up Mal?
That ain't so hard.

897
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:40,688
He didn't beat me up.
Nobody said that.

898
00:56:40,773 --> 00:56:42,523
Because he's a believer.

899
00:56:42,775 --> 00:56:47,195
He's intelligent, methodical,
and devout in his belief

900
00:56:47,278 --> 00:56:49,655
that killing River is the right thing to do.

901
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:51,724
So no hope of a reward?

902
00:56:53,242 --> 00:56:56,661
Did he say anything about a Miranda?

903
00:56:57,498 --> 00:56:58,539
What is that?

904
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:01,000
Don't know who or what,
but it's on River's mind.

905
00:57:01,085 --> 00:57:03,085
Conjure it might be the reason
they're after her.

906
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:06,047
You think maybe it poses some kind
of threat to the Alliance?

907
00:57:06,130 --> 00:57:07,507
Do we care?

908
00:57:07,882 --> 00:57:09,592
Are we caring about that?

909
00:57:09,675 --> 00:57:10,519
You dumb-ass hogs,

910
00:57:10,545 --> 00:57:13,688
the only people she's a threat
to is us on this boat.

911
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:16,014
Look, we get back to Haven
in a few hours' time.

912
00:57:16,099 --> 00:57:18,266
Oh, yeah. Hiding under the Shepherd's skirts

913
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:19,351
that's a manful scheme.

914
00:57:19,436 --> 00:57:20,478
You wanna run this ship?

915
00:57:20,561 --> 00:57:21,561
Yes.

916
00:57:22,523 --> 00:57:24,356
Well, you can't.

917
00:57:25,067 --> 00:57:27,275
Do a damn sight better job than you.

918
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,820
Getting us lashed over a couple of strays.

919
00:57:30,030 --> 00:57:32,030
No offense, Doc.
I think it's noble as a grape,

920
00:57:32,115 --> 00:57:33,324
the way you look to River.

921
00:57:33,407 --> 00:57:35,867
But she ain't my sister
and she ain't your crew.

922
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:38,329
Oh, and neither is she exactly helpless.

923
00:57:38,704 --> 00:57:41,206
So where's it writ that we got to lay down
our lives for her?

924
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:42,851
Which is what you've steered us toward.

925
00:57:42,918 --> 00:57:44,469
I didn't start this.

926
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,838
No, that's right.

927
00:57:47,672 --> 00:57:49,269
Alliance starts the war,

928
00:57:49,494 --> 00:57:51,365
and then you volunteer.

929
00:57:53,262 --> 00:57:54,971
Battle of Serenity, Mal.

930
00:57:55,054 --> 00:57:58,166
Besides Zoe here, how many...
Hey, I'm talking at you.

931
00:58:02,311 --> 00:58:05,255
How many men in your platoon
came out of there alive?

932
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:10,735
You wanna leave this room.

933
00:58:13,574 --> 00:58:15,282
Damn right, I do.

934
00:58:22,623 --> 00:58:24,666
This isn't the war, Mal.

935
00:58:25,543 --> 00:58:27,753
You telling me that 'cause you think
I don't know?

936
00:58:27,838 --> 00:58:29,963
You came to the Training House
looking for a fight.

937
00:58:30,047 --> 00:58:31,623
I came looking for you.

938
00:58:33,260 --> 00:58:35,677
I just want to know who I'm dealing with.

939
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:38,231
I've seen too many versions
of you to be sure.

940
00:58:38,681 --> 00:58:40,260
I start fighting a war,

941
00:58:40,885 --> 00:58:43,059
I guarantee you'll see something new.

942
00:58:50,110 --> 00:58:51,318
We'll get off.

943
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:53,028
River and I will get off at Haven.

944
00:58:53,112 --> 00:58:54,864
We'll find some...
Nobody's saying that.

945
00:58:54,947 --> 00:58:56,740
Nobody besides Jayne is saying that.

946
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:57,824
Mal.

947
00:59:00,329 --> 00:59:02,103
I got no answers for you, Inara.

948
00:59:02,327 --> 00:59:03,438
I got no rudder.

949
00:59:03,498 --> 00:59:05,472
Wind blows northerly, I go north.

950
00:59:05,496 --> 00:59:06,483
That's who I am.

951
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:09,085
Now maybe that ain't a man to lead,
but they have to follow.

952
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:10,253
So you wanna tear me down,

953
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:12,505
do it inside your own mind.
I'm not trying to tear you down.

954
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:14,175
But you fog things up.

955
00:59:14,967 --> 00:59:16,277
You always have.

956
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:19,764
You spin me about.

957
00:59:22,976 --> 00:59:25,101
I wish like hell you was elsewhere.

958
00:59:27,313 --> 00:59:28,438
I was.

959
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:03,826
No trouble, little crazy person.

960
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:09,206
We're going for a nice shuttle ride.

961
01:01:26,724 --> 01:01:28,516
She's out. Jayne's down.

962
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:31,269
The other way.
Find her and do not engage.

963
01:01:53,626 --> 01:01:55,126
It's gonna be okay...

964
01:02:05,722 --> 01:02:07,889
She's sealed off the bridge.
I do not like her there.

965
01:02:07,974 --> 01:02:09,653
Check the shuttle.
She could have snuck in.

966
01:02:09,726 --> 01:02:10,726
Captain.

967
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,692
The government's man,
he says you're a danger to us.

968
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:02,318
Not worth helping.

969
01:03:04,905 --> 01:03:06,072
Is he right?

970
01:03:07,367 --> 01:03:09,784
Are you anything but a weapon?

971
01:03:12,998 --> 01:03:16,083
I've staked my crew's life on the theory
you're a person,

972
01:03:16,168 --> 01:03:19,494
actual and whole, and if I'm wrong,
you'd best shoot me now.

973
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:22,380
Or we could talk more.

974
01:03:33,518 --> 01:03:34,601
Miranda.

975
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:41,108
How can it be there's a whole planet
called Miranda

976
01:03:41,193 --> 01:03:42,443
and none of us knowed that?

977
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,731
Because there isn't one.
It's a blackrock.

978
01:03:44,755 --> 01:03:45,927
Uninhabitable.

979
01:03:46,405 --> 01:03:49,349
Terraforming didn't hold, or some such.
Few settlers died.

980
01:03:49,534 --> 01:03:50,992
Was it right before the war?

981
01:03:51,077 --> 01:03:52,329
I had to show them.

982
01:03:52,554 --> 01:03:54,878
I didn't know if you were
going to make me sleep.

983
01:03:56,583 --> 01:03:57,625
You could have asked.

984
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:58,791
Wait a tick, yeah.

985
01:03:58,876 --> 01:04:02,463
Some years back, there was call
for workers to settle on Miranda.

986
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:04,340
Daddy talked about it.
Nothing about it on the Cortex.

987
01:04:04,423 --> 01:04:06,425
History, Astronomy, it's not in there.

988
01:04:06,510 --> 01:04:08,844
Half of writing history is hiding the truth.

989
01:04:08,929 --> 01:04:11,847
There's something on that rock
the Alliance doesn't want known.

990
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:14,172
That's right at the edge
of the Burnham Quadrant, right?

991
01:04:14,184 --> 01:04:16,518
Furthest planet out?
It's not that far from here.

992
01:04:16,603 --> 01:04:18,311
Whoa. No. No. Honey...
That's a bad notion.

993
01:04:18,438 --> 01:04:19,572
You show them the bad.
I got it, baby.

994
01:04:24,443 --> 01:04:27,112
This is us at Haven, and here's Miranda.

995
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:31,867
All along here, that empty space in between,
that's Reaver territory.

996
01:04:31,952 --> 01:04:34,577
They just float out there,
sending out raiding parties.

997
01:04:34,663 --> 01:04:36,996
Nobody ventures there.
Not even the Alliance.

998
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:39,333
You go through that,
you're signing up to be a banquet.

999
01:04:39,416 --> 01:04:42,001
I'm on board with our standard
run-and-hide scenario.

1000
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:43,795
And we are just about...

1001
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:45,630
Wait.

1002
01:05:02,983 --> 01:05:04,233
Doesn't look like Reavers.

1003
01:05:04,317 --> 01:05:05,342
Wasn't.

1004
01:05:10,990 --> 01:05:11,990
Shepherd?

1005
01:05:13,784 --> 01:05:14,809
Shepherd?

1006
01:05:16,246 --> 01:05:17,496
Shepherd Book?

1007
01:05:38,559 --> 01:05:40,018
Get the Doc.

1008
01:05:41,228 --> 01:05:42,271
Shepherd.

1009
01:05:43,523 --> 01:05:44,606
Don't move.

1010
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:46,358
Won't go far.

1011
01:05:48,987 --> 01:05:50,987
Shouldn't have been you.

1012
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:54,307
Alliance should've hit us.
Should've hit me.

1013
01:05:55,784 --> 01:05:57,536
That crossed my mind.

1014
01:06:02,041 --> 01:06:03,458
I shot him down.

1015
01:06:03,543 --> 01:06:05,210
Yeah. I see.

1016
01:06:05,420 --> 01:06:08,005
I killed the ship that killed us.

1017
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:11,717
Not very Christian of me.

1018
01:06:12,177 --> 01:06:13,719
You did what's right.

1019
01:06:14,179 --> 01:06:18,222
Coming from you,
that means almost nothing.

1020
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:24,646
I'm long gone.

1021
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:26,356
No, Doc will bring you around.

1022
01:06:26,440 --> 01:06:29,318
I look to be bored by many more
sermons before you slip.

1023
01:06:29,402 --> 01:06:30,693
Just don't move.

1024
01:06:31,278 --> 01:06:33,072
Can't order me around, boy.

1025
01:06:34,407 --> 01:06:36,157
I'm not one of your crew.

1026
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:39,661
Yes, you are.

1027
01:06:42,498 --> 01:06:44,375
River...
Come on.

1028
01:06:44,793 --> 01:06:45,793
Hey.

1029
01:06:47,586 --> 01:06:50,063
I don't care what you believe.

1030
01:06:50,288 --> 01:06:51,771
Just believe it.

1031
01:06:53,217 --> 01:06:54,809
Whatever you...

1032
01:07:28,460 --> 01:07:30,204
How come they ain't waiting?

1033
01:07:31,672 --> 01:07:34,132
They knowed we was coming,
how come they only sent one?

1034
01:07:35,802 --> 01:07:37,836
They didn't know we were coming here.

1035
01:07:38,887 --> 01:07:40,597
Get on the Cortex.

1036
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:42,557
Wave, Li Shen, the Sanchez brothers,

1037
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:44,601
anyone who has ever sheltered us
after a heist.

1038
01:07:44,686 --> 01:07:46,045
Tell them to get out.

1039
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:47,478
Get out now.

1040
01:07:58,657 --> 01:07:59,824
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1041
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:05,706
<i>If your quarry goes to ground,
leave no ground to go to.</i>

1042
01:08:06,833 --> 01:08:08,876
<i>You should have taken my offer.</i>

1043
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:11,503
<i>Or did you think none
of this was your fault?</i>

1044
01:08:11,795 --> 01:08:13,755
I don't murder children.

1045
01:08:14,173 --> 01:08:15,173
<i>I do.</i>

1046
01:08:16,091 --> 01:08:18,135
<i>If I have to.</i>
Why?

1047
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:22,180
Do you even know why they sent you?

1048
01:08:22,931 --> 01:08:24,682
<i>It's not my place to ask.</i>

1049
01:08:25,894 --> 01:08:28,436
<i>I believe in something greater than myself.</i>

1050
01:08:29,564 --> 01:08:30,980
<i>A better world.</i>

1051
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:33,442
<i>A world without sin.</i>

1052
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:35,944
So me and mine gotta lay down and die

1053
01:08:36,029 --> 01:08:38,137
so you can live in your better world?

1054
01:08:38,698 --> 01:08:40,865
<i>I'm not going to live there.</i>

1055
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:42,826
<i>There's no place for me there</i>

1056
01:08:42,911 --> 01:08:46,788
<i>any more than there is for you.
Malcolm, I'm a monster.</i>

1057
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:49,750
<i>What I do is evil.</i>

1058
01:08:49,833 --> 01:08:52,377
<i>I have no illusions about it,
but it must be done.</i>

1059
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:53,761
Keep talking.

1060
01:08:54,255 --> 01:08:56,297
You're not getting
a location trace off this wave.

1061
01:08:56,381 --> 01:09:00,202
<i>And every minute you keep River Tam
from me more people will die.</i>

1062
01:09:00,225 --> 01:09:01,427
You think I care?

1063
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:02,887
<i>Of course you care.</i>

1064
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,457
<i>You're not a Reaver, Mal.</i>

1065
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:09,560
<i>You're a human man and you
will never understand how...</i>

1066
01:09:15,819 --> 01:09:17,610
Get these bodies together.

1067
01:09:18,112 --> 01:09:19,404
We got time for grave digging?

1068
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:20,823
Zoe, you and Simon rope them together.

1069
01:09:20,907 --> 01:09:23,617
Five or six of them.
I want them laid out on the nose of our ship.

1070
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:25,993
Are you insane?
I won't desecrate these bodies.

1071
01:09:26,078 --> 01:09:27,912
I don't understand.
What do you mean, the bodies...

1072
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,516
I want you to muck up the reactor core.

1073
01:09:29,541 --> 01:09:31,542
Just enough to leave a trail
and make it read like

1074
01:09:31,626 --> 01:09:33,787
we're flying without containment,
not enough to fry us.

1075
01:09:33,877 --> 01:09:35,671
These people are our friends.
Kaylee,

1076
01:09:35,755 --> 01:09:38,590
you got a day's work to do
and two hours to do it.

1077
01:09:39,591 --> 01:09:43,845
Jayne, you and Wash hoist up the cannon mount.
Goes right on top.

1078
01:09:43,930 --> 01:09:45,649
Piece or two of the other ship, stick it on.

1079
01:09:45,681 --> 01:09:48,934
Any place you can tear hull without
inner breach, do that, too.

1080
01:09:49,769 --> 01:09:51,145
We're gonna need paint.

1081
01:09:51,270 --> 01:09:53,128
We're gonna need red paint.

1082
01:09:53,523 --> 01:09:54,523
Sir,

1083
01:09:54,983 --> 01:09:58,402
do you really mean to turn our home
into an abomination

1084
01:09:58,485 --> 01:10:00,319
so that we can make a suicidal attempt

1085
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:02,447
at passing through Reaver space?

1086
01:10:02,532 --> 01:10:03,823
I mean to live.

1087
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:05,701
I mean for us to live.

1088
01:10:05,784 --> 01:10:08,328
The Alliance won't have that,
so we go where they don't follow.

1089
01:10:08,412 --> 01:10:10,581
God's balls, there ain't no way
we're going out there.

1090
01:10:10,664 --> 01:10:11,998
Think about what you're asking.

1091
01:10:12,082 --> 01:10:14,251
Those Reavers'll eat us alive...

1092
01:10:16,378 --> 01:10:17,796
This is how it is.

1093
01:10:18,213 --> 01:10:19,894
Anybody doesn't wanna fly
with me anymore,

1094
01:10:19,966 --> 01:10:21,800
this is your port of harbor.

1095
01:10:22,676 --> 01:10:24,720
There's a lot of fine ways to die.

1096
01:10:24,804 --> 01:10:27,514
I ain't waiting for the Alliance
to choose mine.

1097
01:10:31,101 --> 01:10:34,270
I mean to confound these bungers.
Take my shot at getting to Miranda.

1098
01:10:34,354 --> 01:10:36,899
Maybe find something
I can use to get clear of this.

1099
01:10:36,983 --> 01:10:39,902
So I hear a word out of any of you
that ain't helping me out

1100
01:10:39,985 --> 01:10:42,487
or taking your leave,
I will shoot you down.

1101
01:10:47,452 --> 01:10:48,784
Get to work.

1102
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:14,936
Sir...

1103
01:11:15,020 --> 01:11:16,563
Just tell me when we're close.

1104
01:12:24,465 --> 01:12:25,465
Wash.

1105
01:13:30,113 --> 01:13:33,324
Define disappeared.

1106
01:13:38,081 --> 01:13:40,332
Every reading I'm getting says normal.

1107
01:13:41,042 --> 01:13:44,377
Oceans, land masses.
No tectonic instability or radiation.

1108
01:13:44,462 --> 01:13:46,046
Yeah, but no power, either.

1109
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:47,421
Nothing at all?

1110
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:48,506
Wait.

1111
01:13:49,175 --> 01:13:50,300
Something.

1112
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:53,845
It might be a beacon, but it's awful weak.

1113
01:13:54,514 --> 01:13:55,930
Find it.

1114
01:14:04,231 --> 01:14:05,856
<i>Gravity's Earthnorm.</i>

1115
01:14:06,525 --> 01:14:08,734
<i>O2 levels check, pressure...</i>

1116
01:14:09,529 --> 01:14:11,764
<i>If anything's wrong the scanner's
not reading it.</i>

1117
01:14:18,203 --> 01:14:20,579
Well, something sure the hell ain't right.

1118
01:14:23,542 --> 01:14:24,823
This ain't no little settlement.

1119
01:14:24,877 --> 01:14:27,612
<i>We flew over at least
a dozen cities just as big.</i>

1120
01:14:27,796 --> 01:14:29,965
<i>Why didn't we ever hear about this?</i>

1121
01:14:32,051 --> 01:14:33,426
Beacon's up ahead.

1122
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:57,492
Ho.

1123
01:15:17,555 --> 01:15:19,930
No entry wounds, fractures.

1124
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:21,600
Poison?

1125
01:15:34,238 --> 01:15:35,863
Got another one.

1126
01:15:41,453 --> 01:15:43,162
They's just sitting here.

1127
01:15:44,873 --> 01:15:46,123
They didn't crash.

1128
01:16:00,680 --> 01:16:02,224
Kaylee. Don't...

1129
01:16:07,979 --> 01:16:10,231
How come these ones are preserved?

1130
01:16:10,774 --> 01:16:12,900
Place must've gone hermetic
when the power blew.

1131
01:16:12,984 --> 01:16:14,109
Sealed them.

1132
01:16:14,194 --> 01:16:15,654
What are they doing?

1133
01:16:16,822 --> 01:16:18,739
What's everybody doing?

1134
01:16:18,990 --> 01:16:21,451
There's no unusual discoloration.

1135
01:16:21,993 --> 01:16:24,703
Nobody's doubled over
or showing signs of pain.

1136
01:16:25,163 --> 01:16:27,498
There's gasses that kill painless, right?

1137
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:30,167
They didn't fall.
None of them.

1138
01:16:30,543 --> 01:16:32,295
They just lay down.

1139
01:16:36,050 --> 01:16:39,301
Make them stop.
They're everywhere.

1140
01:16:40,220 --> 01:16:42,346
Every city, every...

1141
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:45,516
Every house, every room,
they're all inside me.

1142
01:16:45,643 --> 01:16:49,061
I can hear them all,
and they're saying nothing!

1143
01:16:50,105 --> 01:16:51,105
Get up.

1144
01:16:52,190 --> 01:16:53,692
Please get up.

1145
01:16:58,488 --> 01:17:00,681
Please, God, make me a stone.

1146
01:17:01,993 --> 01:17:03,827
She is starting to damage my calm.

1147
01:17:03,911 --> 01:17:05,412
Jayne.
She's right!

1148
01:17:06,413 --> 01:17:08,038
Everybody's dead.

1149
01:17:09,542 --> 01:17:11,835
This whole world is dead for no reason!

1150
01:17:14,255 --> 01:17:16,171
Let's get to the beacon.

1151
01:17:42,240 --> 01:17:44,158
This is the source?

1152
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,747
This ship's banged up all to hell.

1153
01:18:06,974 --> 01:18:09,768
<i>These are just a few of the images
we've recorded.</i>

1154
01:18:10,853 --> 01:18:12,436
<i>And you can see</i>

1155
01:18:14,105 --> 01:18:15,648
<i>it isn't what we thought.</i>

1156
01:18:17,234 --> 01:18:18,734
<i>There's been no war here,</i>

1157
01:18:19,737 --> 01:18:22,822
<i>and no terraforming event.
The environment is stable.</i>

1158
01:18:27,953 --> 01:18:29,371
<i>It's the Pax.</i>

1159
01:18:30,872 --> 01:18:35,210
<i>The G-23 Paxilon Hydroclorate
that we added to the air processors.</i>

1160
01:18:36,170 --> 01:18:39,922
<i>It was supposed to calm the population,
weed out aggression.</i>

1161
01:18:42,009 --> 01:18:43,635
<i>Well, it works.</i>

1162
01:18:44,552 --> 01:18:46,970
<i>The people here stopped fighting.</i>

1163
01:18:47,972 --> 01:18:50,600
<i>And then they stopped everything else.</i>

1164
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:57,689
<i>They stopped going to work,</i>

1165
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:02,820
<i>they stopped breeding, talking, eating.</i>

1166
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:08,210
<i>There's 30 million people here,
and they all just let themselves die.</i>

1167
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:13,414
<i>I have to be quick.</i>

1168
01:19:14,542 --> 01:19:19,253
<i>About a tenth of a percent of the population
had the opposite reaction to the Pax.</i>

1169
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:22,923
<i>Their aggressor response increased
beyond madness.</i>

1170
01:19:23,341 --> 01:19:24,551
<i>They have become...</i>

1171
01:19:26,929 --> 01:19:28,595
<i>Well, they've killed most of us.</i>

1172
01:19:29,681 --> 01:19:31,432
<i>And not just killed,</i>

1173
01:19:33,269 --> 01:19:35,019
<i>they've done things.</i>

1174
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:36,534
Reavers.

1175
01:19:37,060 --> 01:19:38,814
They made them.

1176
01:19:40,275 --> 01:19:42,216
<i>I won't live to report this,</i>

1177
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:44,427
<i>but people have to know.</i>

1178
01:19:45,698 --> 01:19:47,489
<i>We meant it for the best,</i>

1179
01:19:47,992 --> 01:19:49,074
<i>to make people safer.</i>

1180
01:19:51,162 --> 01:19:54,204
<i>God!</i>

1181
01:19:59,043 --> 01:20:00,920
Turn it off.

1182
01:20:25,613 --> 01:20:26,820
River.

1183
01:20:26,905 --> 01:20:28,298
I'm all right.

1184
01:20:35,997 --> 01:20:37,497
I'm all right.

1185
01:20:46,257 --> 01:20:48,318
This report is maybe 12 years old.

1186
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:53,297
Parliament buried it,
and it stayed buried till River dug it up.

1187
01:20:55,225 --> 01:20:57,444
This is what they feared she knew.

1188
01:20:58,270 --> 01:21:00,104
And they were right to fear,

1189
01:21:00,648 --> 01:21:03,649
because there's a whole universe of folk
who are gonna know it, too.

1190
01:21:03,734 --> 01:21:05,359
They're gonna see it.

1191
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:08,613
Somebody has to speak for these people.

1192
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:14,368
You all got on this boat for different reasons,

1193
01:21:14,453 --> 01:21:16,621
but you all come to the same place.

1194
01:21:17,081 --> 01:21:20,250
So now I'm asking more
of you than I have before.

1195
01:21:21,377 --> 01:21:22,710
Maybe all.

1196
01:21:24,671 --> 01:21:27,881
Sure as I know anything I know this,
they will try again.

1197
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:31,719
Maybe on another world,
maybe on this very ground swept clean.

1198
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:34,639
A year from now, 10,
they'll swing back to the belief

1199
01:21:34,806 --> 01:21:36,890
that they can make people...

1200
01:21:39,603 --> 01:21:40,603
better.

1201
01:21:43,774 --> 01:21:45,817
And I do not hold to that.

1202
01:21:48,153 --> 01:21:49,570
So no more running.

1203
01:21:52,115 --> 01:21:53,824
I aim to misbehave.

1204
01:22:01,625 --> 01:22:03,876
Shepherd Book used to tell me,

1205
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:06,003
If you can't do something smart,

1206
01:22:07,547 --> 01:22:09,340
do something right.

1207
01:22:10,634 --> 01:22:11,842
Do we have a plan?

1208
01:22:11,926 --> 01:22:13,344
Mr. Universe.

1209
01:22:13,929 --> 01:22:15,930
We haven't the equipment
to broadwave this code,

1210
01:22:16,015 --> 01:22:18,515
but he can put it on every screen for 30 worlds.

1211
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:20,851
He's pretty damn close, too.

1212
01:22:21,395 --> 01:22:22,520
We still got the Reavers

1213
01:22:22,604 --> 01:22:24,855
and probably the Alliance,
between us and him.

1214
01:22:25,149 --> 01:22:27,859
That's two armies against our
one bitty cannon.

1215
01:22:28,027 --> 01:22:30,828
It's a fair bet the Alliance knows
about Mr. Universe.

1216
01:22:31,113 --> 01:22:32,572
They're gonna see this coming.

1217
01:22:33,698 --> 01:22:34,698
No.

1218
01:22:36,743 --> 01:22:39,078
They're not gonna see this coming.

1219
01:22:47,378 --> 01:22:49,338
<i>No problem. Bring it on.
Bring it on. Bring it on.</i>

1220
01:22:49,715 --> 01:22:52,341
<i>From here to the eyes and ears of the 'verse.
That's my motto,</i>

1221
01:22:52,426 --> 01:22:54,801
<i>or it might be, if I start having a motto.</i>

1222
01:22:54,886 --> 01:22:55,927
We won't be long.

1223
01:22:56,012 --> 01:22:57,971
<i>You're going to get caught in the ion cloud.</i>

1224
01:22:58,056 --> 01:22:59,681
<i>It'll play merry hob with your radar,</i>

1225
01:22:59,766 --> 01:23:02,644
<i>but pretty lights and a few miles after,
you'll be right in my orbit.</i>

1226
01:23:02,728 --> 01:23:04,895
You'll let us know if anyone else comes at you?

1227
01:23:04,979 --> 01:23:06,430
You'll be the first.

1228
01:23:12,779 --> 01:23:13,988
There.

1229
01:23:14,198 --> 01:23:16,239
Toss me my 30 coin,
but I got a news wave for you...

1230
01:23:26,627 --> 01:23:29,753
Call in every ship in the quadrant.
We'll meet them in the air.

1231
01:23:31,381 --> 01:23:32,923
Destroy it all.

1232
01:23:59,618 --> 01:24:02,036
Wash, we almost through?

1233
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:25,059
Now!

1234
01:24:30,606 --> 01:24:32,274
Go! Move!

1235
01:24:51,962 --> 01:24:54,005
I'm reading activity in the cloud.

1236
01:24:54,088 --> 01:24:56,131
Lock and fire on my command.

1237
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,552
You should have let me see her, Captain.

1238
01:25:01,680 --> 01:25:03,337
We should have done this as men.

1239
01:25:04,261 --> 01:25:05,640
Not with fire.

1240
01:25:05,768 --> 01:25:06,768
Sir.

1241
01:25:12,274 --> 01:25:14,024
Vessel in range.
Lock on.

1242
01:25:21,949 --> 01:25:23,868
Bastard's not even changing course.

1243
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:30,041
Sir!

1244
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:34,836
Target the Reavers.

1245
01:25:35,161 --> 01:25:36,680
Target the Reavers!

1246
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:39,132
Target everyone!
Somebody fire!

1247
01:25:56,693 --> 01:25:58,289
I am a leaf on the wind.

1248
01:25:59,114 --> 01:26:01,011
Watch how I soar.

1249
01:26:15,420 --> 01:26:17,087
Chicken's come home to roost.

1250
01:26:18,590 --> 01:26:20,274
The hell?
It's okay.

1251
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:21,842
I am a leaf on the wind!

1252
01:26:21,926 --> 01:26:23,219
What does that mean?

1253
01:26:27,431 --> 01:26:28,932
We're almost through.

1254
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:48,034
No! No! No!
Yes! Yes!

1255
01:27:41,006 --> 01:27:42,506
We're not alone.

1256
01:27:49,221 --> 01:27:50,347
EMP!

1257
01:27:51,224 --> 01:27:52,975
Everybody, strap yourselves into something!

1258
01:27:53,060 --> 01:27:54,060
Jayne.
Got it.

1259
01:27:55,395 --> 01:27:57,145
Kaylee, come on.

1260
01:28:09,909 --> 01:28:11,284
We're fried.
I got no control.

1261
01:28:11,369 --> 01:28:12,752
Where's the backup?

1262
01:28:12,877 --> 01:28:14,337
Where's the backup?

1263
01:28:22,296 --> 01:28:23,672
Check! Check!

1264
01:28:48,073 --> 01:28:49,198
Get up!

1265
01:28:49,282 --> 01:28:50,323
Stop it!

1266
01:28:55,913 --> 01:28:57,998
Backup reads at 20%.
Can you get us down?

1267
01:28:58,082 --> 01:28:59,404
I'm going to have to glide her in.

1268
01:28:59,417 --> 01:29:01,167
Will that work?

1269
01:29:55,931 --> 01:29:57,640
I am a leaf on the wind.

1270
01:29:59,853 --> 01:30:00,895
Watch how...

1271
01:30:03,939 --> 01:30:06,399
Wash, baby. Baby, no.

1272
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,326
Baby, come on. You gotta go.
Come on.

1273
01:30:08,487 --> 01:30:09,404
We gotta move.

1274
01:30:09,429 --> 01:30:12,079
Baby, please. We gotta
move, baby, come on.

1275
01:30:14,894 --> 01:30:16,194
Come on.
Zoe!

1276
01:30:17,746 --> 01:30:19,662
Move out! Now!

1277
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:24,542
Go. Go.

1278
01:30:25,212 --> 01:30:26,545
Head inside!

1279
01:30:45,649 --> 01:30:47,233
Jayne, rearguard.

1280
01:30:54,865 --> 01:30:55,824
Zoe, what've we got?

1281
01:30:55,908 --> 01:30:56,934
Sir,

1282
01:30:59,037 --> 01:31:00,287
this is a good hold point.

1283
01:31:00,622 --> 01:31:02,247
We all stay together.
No.

1284
01:31:02,332 --> 01:31:03,572
They have to come through here.

1285
01:31:03,582 --> 01:31:05,542
They'll bottleneck, we can thin them out.

1286
01:31:05,627 --> 01:31:08,420
We get pushed back,
there's the blast doors.

1287
01:31:08,546 --> 01:31:10,881
I can rig them so they won't reopen
once they close.

1288
01:31:10,966 --> 01:31:11,966
Shut them and hide until I get...

1289
01:31:12,050 --> 01:31:14,009
We need to draw them till it's done.

1290
01:31:15,136 --> 01:31:17,512
This is the place.
We'll buy you the time.

1291
01:31:22,394 --> 01:31:24,712
All right, let's move these crates
back there for cover.

1292
01:31:24,895 --> 01:31:27,230
Make sure they ain't filled
with nothing goes boom.

1293
01:31:27,690 --> 01:31:29,733
Wait, Wash! Where's Wash?

1294
01:31:30,860 --> 01:31:32,444
He ain't coming.

1295
01:31:37,576 --> 01:31:39,359
Move the gorramn crates!

1296
01:31:57,345 --> 01:31:59,146
Tell me you brought them this time.

1297
01:32:22,578 --> 01:32:23,828
Zoe?

1298
01:32:25,998 --> 01:32:27,416
Are you here?

1299
01:32:27,500 --> 01:32:28,626
Do the job, sir.

1300
01:32:31,212 --> 01:32:33,838
You hold.
Hold till I get back.

1301
01:32:37,927 --> 01:32:38,969
Captain's right.

1302
01:32:39,054 --> 01:32:41,756
Can't be thinking on revenge
if we're gonna get through this.

1303
01:32:42,140 --> 01:32:44,667
Do you really think any of us
are gonna get through this?

1304
01:32:48,313 --> 01:32:49,354
I might.

1305
01:33:06,413 --> 01:33:07,413
No.

1306
01:33:28,979 --> 01:33:29,979
Mal.

1307
01:33:30,854 --> 01:33:32,564
Guy killed me, Mal.

1308
01:33:32,983 --> 01:33:36,193
He killed me with a sword.
How weird is that?

1309
01:33:37,069 --> 01:33:40,989
I got a short span here.

1310
01:33:42,449 --> 01:33:44,201
They destroyed my equipment,

1311
01:33:44,536 --> 01:33:46,119
but I have a backup unit.

1312
01:33:46,203 --> 01:33:48,579
Bottom of the complex,
right over the generator.

1313
01:33:49,039 --> 01:33:52,208
Hard to get to.
I know they missed it.

1314
01:33:53,002 --> 01:33:55,212
They can't stop the signal, Mal.

1315
01:33:56,088 --> 01:33:58,506
They can never stop the signal.

1316
01:34:02,720 --> 01:34:05,096
The Reavers.
They are all made up of rage.

1317
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:06,222
It's okay.
It's okay.

1318
01:34:06,265 --> 01:34:07,875
I can't shut them up.

1319
01:34:11,729 --> 01:34:12,895
Stay low.

1320
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:16,841
She picked a sweet bung of a time
to go helpless on us.

1321
01:34:18,110 --> 01:34:19,350
Jayne and I take the first wave.

1322
01:34:19,362 --> 01:34:21,505
Nobody shoots unless they get past our fire.

1323
01:34:25,702 --> 01:34:28,328
I didn't plan on going out like this.

1324
01:34:30,164 --> 01:34:31,815
I think we did right, but...

1325
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,012
No. I never planned...

1326
01:34:36,537 --> 01:34:37,878
anything.

1327
01:34:39,716 --> 01:34:41,725
I just wanted to keep River safe.

1328
01:34:45,680 --> 01:34:49,350
Spent so much time on Serenity
ignoring anything

1329
01:34:50,310 --> 01:34:52,810
that I wanted for myself.

1330
01:34:57,567 --> 01:34:59,943
My one regret in all of this...

1331
01:35:01,237 --> 01:35:02,945
is never being with you.

1332
01:35:05,074 --> 01:35:06,408
With me?

1333
01:35:08,161 --> 01:35:10,162
You mean to say, as...

1334
01:35:12,122 --> 01:35:13,247
Sex?

1335
01:35:15,502 --> 01:35:17,293
I mean to say.

1336
01:35:22,257 --> 01:35:23,623
Hell with this.

1337
01:35:23,748 --> 01:35:25,409
I'm gonna live.

1338
01:35:39,317 --> 01:35:40,251
Mal.

1339
01:35:40,475 --> 01:35:42,676
Guy killed me, Mal.

1340
01:35:43,738 --> 01:35:45,405
He killed me with a sword.

1341
01:36:24,112 --> 01:36:25,695
Hard to get to.

1342
01:36:27,030 --> 01:36:28,698
That's a fact.

1343
01:36:35,998 --> 01:36:37,498
Zoe, gorrammit!

1344
01:36:53,349 --> 01:36:55,684
Zoe, get your ass back on the line!

1345
01:37:12,202 --> 01:37:13,911
You shot me in the back!

1346
01:37:15,537 --> 01:37:17,997
I haven't made you angry, have I?

1347
01:37:18,082 --> 01:37:21,167
There are a lot of innocent people
in the air being killed right now.

1348
01:37:21,252 --> 01:37:23,712
You have no idea how true that is.

1349
01:37:25,172 --> 01:37:26,840
I know the secret.

1350
01:37:27,591 --> 01:37:30,051
The truth that burned up River Tam's brain.

1351
01:37:30,845 --> 01:37:32,631
Rest of the 'verse is going to know it, too.

1352
01:37:33,657 --> 01:37:34,956
'Cause they need to.

1353
01:37:36,809 --> 01:37:38,411
Do you really believe that?

1354
01:37:39,395 --> 01:37:40,520
I do.

1355
01:37:40,604 --> 01:37:42,730
You willing to die for that belief?

1356
01:37:45,109 --> 01:37:46,275
I am.

1357
01:37:53,076 --> 01:37:55,118
Of course, that ain't exactly Plan A.

1358
01:38:21,645 --> 01:38:22,688
Spine's intact.

1359
01:38:22,771 --> 01:38:23,939
Just give me a bandage.

1360
01:39:17,534 --> 01:39:18,993
Up high, left!

1361
01:39:26,711 --> 01:39:27,869
Kaylee!

1362
01:39:40,850 --> 01:39:44,670
Fall back! Everybody, fall back!
Fall back now!

1363
01:39:54,363 --> 01:39:55,655
Jayne, grenade.

1364
01:39:57,033 --> 01:39:59,242
Very last one.

1365
01:40:05,248 --> 01:40:06,332
They're gonna get in.

1366
01:40:06,708 --> 01:40:09,418
I can close it from the outside.

1367
01:40:09,796 --> 01:40:11,697
No one's coming back from that.

1368
01:40:14,759 --> 01:40:16,717
How much ammo do we have?

1369
01:40:16,844 --> 01:40:19,721
Three, four max, and my swinging cod.

1370
01:40:20,046 --> 01:40:21,806
That's all.
The lift isn't moving.

1371
01:40:21,890 --> 01:40:24,350
When they come,
try to plug the hole with it.

1372
01:40:24,435 --> 01:40:26,853
I'm starting to lose some feeling here.

1373
01:40:26,938 --> 01:40:29,448
Lie still.
I'm going to give you something...

1374
01:40:31,650 --> 01:40:32,650
My bag.

1375
01:40:42,994 --> 01:40:44,537
Keep pressure here.

1376
01:40:46,289 --> 01:40:47,289
My bag.

1377
01:40:47,792 --> 01:40:48,792
I need...

1378
01:40:49,627 --> 01:40:53,130
adrenaline and a shot of...

1379
01:40:53,631 --> 01:40:55,256
calaphar for Kaylee.

1380
01:40:57,969 --> 01:40:59,636
I can't.

1381
01:41:03,474 --> 01:41:04,474
River.

1382
01:41:09,604 --> 01:41:11,439
River, I'm sorry.

1383
01:41:11,524 --> 01:41:12,570
No.

1384
01:41:13,496 --> 01:41:14,524
No.

1385
01:41:21,993 --> 01:41:23,076
I hate to leave.

1386
01:41:23,161 --> 01:41:24,202
You won't.

1387
01:41:27,122 --> 01:41:29,707
You take care of me, Simon.

1388
01:41:32,837 --> 01:41:35,363
You've always taken care of me.

1389
01:41:40,802 --> 01:41:41,802
My turn.

1390
01:42:36,818 --> 01:42:38,944
Do you know what your sin is, Mal?

1391
01:42:40,070 --> 01:42:41,118
Go to hell.

1392
01:42:42,043 --> 01:42:43,430
I'm a fan of all seven.

1393
01:42:49,913 --> 01:42:51,265
But right now,

1394
01:42:52,750 --> 01:42:54,751
I'm going to have to go with wrath.

1395
01:42:59,215 --> 01:43:01,074
We ain't got long.

1396
01:43:07,681 --> 01:43:09,599
You suppose he got through?

1397
01:43:10,851 --> 01:43:12,810
Do you think Mal got the word out?

1398
01:43:13,479 --> 01:43:14,878
He got through.

1399
01:43:15,503 --> 01:43:17,722
I know he got through.

1400
01:43:29,161 --> 01:43:30,420
I'm sorry.

1401
01:43:33,457 --> 01:43:35,850
You should know there's no shame in this.

1402
01:43:38,462 --> 01:43:40,588
You've done remarkable things.

1403
01:43:41,798 --> 01:43:43,609
But you're fighting a war...

1404
01:43:45,176 --> 01:43:46,386
you've already lost.

1405
01:43:51,434 --> 01:43:53,143
Well, I'm known for that.

1406
01:44:02,028 --> 01:44:05,255
Piece of shrapnel tore up that nerve
cluster my first tour.

1407
01:44:06,282 --> 01:44:07,615
Had it moved.

1408
01:44:09,201 --> 01:44:10,659
Sorry about the throat.

1409
01:44:11,244 --> 01:44:14,079
Expect you'd want to say your famous
last words right now.

1410
01:44:15,166 --> 01:44:16,707
Just one trouble.

1411
01:44:21,421 --> 01:44:22,922
I ain't gonna kill you.

1412
01:44:26,426 --> 01:44:29,511
Hell, I'm gonna grant your greatest wish.

1413
01:44:36,854 --> 01:44:39,689
I'm gonna show you a world without sin.

1414
01:44:45,529 --> 01:44:48,698
<i>These are just a few of the few images
we've recorded and you can see...</i>

1415
01:44:51,618 --> 01:44:53,787
<i>it isn't what we thought.</i>

1416
01:44:55,413 --> 01:44:57,289
<i>There's been no war here,</i>

1417
01:44:58,042 --> 01:45:00,109
<i>and no terraforming event.</i>

1418
01:45:00,534 --> 01:45:02,560
<i>The environment is stable.</i>

1419
01:45:03,881 --> 01:45:05,474
<i>It's the Pax.</i>

1420
01:45:07,385 --> 01:45:11,720
<i>The G-23 Paxilon Hydroclorate that
we added to the air processors.</i>

1421
01:45:12,430 --> 01:45:14,858
<i>It was supposed to calm the population...</i>

1422
01:45:43,628 --> 01:45:45,296
<i>We meant it for the best,</i>

1423
01:45:46,215 --> 01:45:47,756
<i>to make people safer.</i>

1424
01:45:49,551 --> 01:45:50,844
<i>God!</i>

1425
01:46:13,701 --> 01:46:15,034
Sir?

1426
01:46:15,118 --> 01:46:16,161
It's done.

1427
01:46:19,372 --> 01:46:20,707
Report.

1428
01:46:22,835 --> 01:46:24,002
River?

1429
01:46:49,569 --> 01:46:50,569
<i>Drop your weapons!</i>

1430
01:46:50,654 --> 01:46:51,695
<i>Do it now.</i>

1431
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:53,155
<i>Weapons down.
Let it down, now.</i>

1432
01:46:53,239 --> 01:46:54,823
<i>I want to see your hands in the air.</i>

1433
01:46:54,908 --> 01:46:56,784
<i>Stand down.
Do it.</i>

1434
01:47:02,207 --> 01:47:03,707
<i>Targets are acquired.</i>

1435
01:47:03,792 --> 01:47:05,167
<i>Do we have a kill order?</i>

1436
01:47:08,171 --> 01:47:09,963
<i>Do we have an order?</i>

1437
01:47:18,099 --> 01:47:19,349
<i>Stand down.</i>

1438
01:47:20,475 --> 01:47:23,228
<i>Stand down.
It's finished.</i>

1439
01:47:27,065 --> 01:47:28,440
<i>We're finished.</i>

1440
01:49:30,814 --> 01:49:32,649
It's not over, you know.

1441
01:49:34,318 --> 01:49:37,028
I can't guarantee that
they won't come after you.

1442
01:49:37,863 --> 01:49:38,863
The Parliament.

1443
01:49:39,823 --> 01:49:42,742
Your broadwave about Miranda
has weakened their regime.

1444
01:49:42,826 --> 01:49:45,735
They are not gone and they are not...

1445
01:49:46,360 --> 01:49:47,429
forgiving.

1446
01:49:47,789 --> 01:49:49,949
That don't bode especially well for you,

1447
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:52,582
giving the order to let us go,

1448
01:49:52,707 --> 01:49:54,027
patching up our hurt.

1449
01:49:55,381 --> 01:49:57,576
I told them the Tams
were no longer a threat,

1450
01:49:57,801 --> 01:49:58,864
damage done.

1451
01:49:59,342 --> 01:50:00,643
They might listen,

1452
01:50:01,679 --> 01:50:03,412
but I think they know I'm no longer,

1453
01:50:03,936 --> 01:50:05,079
their man.

1454
01:50:06,809 --> 01:50:07,855
They take you down,

1455
01:50:07,881 --> 01:50:09,917
I don't expect to grieve over much.

1456
01:50:12,189 --> 01:50:14,207
Like to kill you myself, I see you again.

1457
01:50:15,400 --> 01:50:16,400
You won't.

1458
01:50:19,320 --> 01:50:21,131
There is nothing left to see.

1459
01:50:27,203 --> 01:50:28,746
Sir, we have a green light.

1460
01:50:29,206 --> 01:50:31,416
Inspection's pos and we're clear for up-thrust.

1461
01:50:37,881 --> 01:50:40,007
Think she'll hold together?

1462
01:50:41,010 --> 01:50:43,636
She's tore up plenty.
But she'll fly true.

1463
01:50:47,975 --> 01:50:49,725
Make sure everything's secure.

1464
01:50:52,061 --> 01:50:53,645
Could be bumpy.

1465
01:50:53,730 --> 01:50:54,980
Always is.

1466
01:51:02,405 --> 01:51:03,506
Taking her out.

1467
01:51:03,548 --> 01:51:05,591
Should be about a day's ride
to get you back to your girls.

1468
01:51:06,076 --> 01:51:07,243
Right.

1469
01:51:08,662 --> 01:51:10,872
Ready to get off this heap,
back to civilized life?

1470
01:51:10,956 --> 01:51:11,956
I...

1471
01:51:16,753 --> 01:51:18,087
I don't know.

1472
01:51:20,131 --> 01:51:21,298
Good answer.

1473
01:51:46,492 --> 01:51:48,676
So you gonna ride shotgun with me,
help me fly?

1474
01:51:49,286 --> 01:51:50,536
That's the plan.

1475
01:51:51,204 --> 01:51:52,662
Think you can work out...

1476
01:52:00,421 --> 01:52:01,421
Okay.

1477
01:52:02,800 --> 01:52:05,226
Clearly some aptitude for the...

1478
01:52:07,429 --> 01:52:09,971
It ain't all buttons and charts, little albatross.

1479
01:52:10,390 --> 01:52:12,516
You know what the first rule of flying is?

1480
01:52:13,018 --> 01:52:16,020
Well, I suppose you do, since you already
know what I'm about to say.

1481
01:52:17,064 --> 01:52:18,122
I do.

1482
01:52:19,690 --> 01:52:21,442
But I like to hear you say it.

1483
01:52:26,198 --> 01:52:27,239
Love.

1484
01:52:27,573 --> 01:52:29,449
You can learn all the math in the 'verse,

1485
01:52:29,534 --> 01:52:31,577
but you take a boat
in the air that you don't love,

1486
01:52:31,662 --> 01:52:34,497
she'll shake you off just as sure
as the turn of the worlds.

1487
01:52:37,835 --> 01:52:40,444
Love keeps her in the air when
she ought to fall down,

1488
01:52:42,005 --> 01:52:44,340
tells you she's hurting before she keels.

1489
01:52:47,136 --> 01:52:48,344
Makes her a home.

1490
01:52:53,975 --> 01:52:55,851
Storm's getting worse.

1491
01:52:58,146 --> 01:53:00,157
We'll pass through it soon enough.

1492
01:53:21,100 --> 01:53:23,020
What was that?

1493
