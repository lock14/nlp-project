1
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:28,791
<i>And it was announced today that another</i>
<i>fifteen thousand National Guard troops</i>

2
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:32,730
<i>would be called to active duty</i>
<i>and deployed to Iraq within the month.</i>

3
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:35,529
<i>President George Bush</i>
<i>is urging all Americans</i>

4
00:00:35,602 --> 00:00:37,900
<i>to stand united on the war in Iraq.</i>

5
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:40,269
<i>And the Bush administration is facing</i>
<i>some difficult decisions</i>

6
00:00:40,340 --> 00:00:42,570
<i>on troop levels for the war in Iraq.</i>

7
00:00:50,583 --> 00:00:54,542
<i>No, you are not bothering us.</i>
<i>I'm glad you called.</i>

8
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:57,351
<i>- How is it going?</i>
- Not good.

9
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:01,293
<i>Oh I do wish we were</i>
<i>there to help you out, hon.</i>

10
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:10,094
<i>I saw on the news last night</i>
<i>that they are extending</i>

11
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,900
<i>all the National Guard people over there.</i>

12
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:15,530
<i>- Will Noah be extended?</i>
- October.

13
00:01:15,608 --> 00:01:20,841
<i>Oh, I can't believe it.</i>
<i>What are you going to do?</i>

14
00:01:21,481 --> 00:01:24,348
Well, we can't afford day care.

15
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:26,442
But if I don't go back to work
in the next six weeks,

16
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:29,579
we're going to lose
the kids' health insurance.

17
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,556
All right you guys, cut it out now. Stop it.

18
00:01:31,624 --> 00:01:35,424
<i>I would offer to come out there and help.</i>
<i>But with Ed's condition I...</i>

19
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:39,522
- No, I know.
- Mommy.

20
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:43,968
<i>- Maybe your parents.</i>
- No.

21
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:47,939
<i>- Well, what about Salman?</i>
- Salman?

22
00:01:50,343 --> 00:01:52,971
- What about him?
<i>- Maybe Salman could come out</i>

23
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:56,607
<i>and help you for a while. I'm sure the boys</i>
<i>would love to meet their uncle.</i>

24
00:01:56,683 --> 00:01:59,846
I don't know. I mean, where is he now?

25
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,513
<i>He is in Nevada.</i>

26
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,579
What is he doing?

27
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,152
Help! Help!

28
00:02:12,499 --> 00:02:14,797
Is he working?

29
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:19,999
<i>No. He was fired again.</i>
<i>I just heard from him on Mother's Day.</i>

30
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,303
- Yeah. What was he fired for?
<i>- Oh...</i>

31
00:02:24,511 --> 00:02:28,470
Okay. When you see the red light
that means it is hot enough to laminate.

32
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:31,312
You just slide everything through here.

33
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,942
And you have to pull it through
on the other side.

34
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:36,318
Jesus Christ, can I just get one color copy?

35
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,425
Here, I'll be right back.

36
00:03:16,396 --> 00:03:19,058
- I didn't want this laminated.
- Why not?

37
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,730
This is my resume.

38
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:38,350
- I don't know.
<i>- I'll call him right now.</i>

39
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,716
<i>I have a number.</i>
<i>I think he is living with some friends.</i>

40
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:49,921
<i>Now, Les, I don't want you to worry.</i>
<i>Everything is going to work out.</i>

41
00:03:49,996 --> 00:03:53,932
<i>Noah will be home in one piece</i>
<i>before you know it, God willing.</i>

42
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,968
<i>I'll call Salman and leave him a message.</i>

43
00:03:56,035 --> 00:04:01,268
<i>It will all work itself out.</i>
<i>And it will all be okay. Okay?</i>

44
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:06,637
<i>The Bush administration sends its top guns</i>
<i>from the Pentagon to Capitol Hill</i>

45
00:04:06,713 --> 00:04:08,977
<i>in an effort to reassure all Americans.</i>

46
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:12,950
<i>A more emotional debate yesterday in the</i>
<i>House of Representatives on the war in Iraq.</i>

47
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:15,180
<i>It ended, as expected,</i>

48
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:18,691
<i>with passage of</i>
<i>a Republican draft resolution that...</i>

49
00:04:18,758 --> 00:04:22,751
<i>President Bush got a briefing</i>
<i>at the Pentagon today. And afterwards...</i>

50
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:42,812
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

51
00:04:42,882 --> 00:04:45,146
- Come in.
- Hi.

52
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,778
- Hi.
- Hi.

53
00:04:52,258 --> 00:04:55,955
- Don't you have luggage?
- Oh yeah.

54
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:59,430
- I have this.
- Yeah, that is luggage.

55
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:05,961
All my other stuff is in storage.
In Vermont and Dubuque.

56
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:08,564
- Okay. Whatever.
- Okay.

57
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,735
- That is an interesting belt.
- Oh, thanks.

58
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,575
Yeah, I made it myself. At work.

59
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:16,638
You know, it is basically a cardboard belt.

60
00:05:16,716 --> 00:05:22,348
But it is made with plastic.
So it is a plastic belt.

61
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,549
- It is cool.
- Thanks.

62
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,227
- So, that is one of them? That is Cameron?
- That is Lincoln.

63
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:33,731
Oh. Okay.

64
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,496
Hi, Cam. Hi, Lincoln. Hi. Hi, Lincoln.

65
00:05:37,270 --> 00:05:38,794
Hi, Lincoln.

66
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,031
No!

67
00:05:40,873 --> 00:05:43,603
Well, yeah. They are kind of shy.

68
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,337
Dinner!

69
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:50,138
<i>Many questions today for</i>
<i>Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld...</i>

70
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:51,945
Cameron, take a bite.

71
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:55,111
No, I don't want to. I won't eat anything!

72
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,425
This is good, water.

73
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:10,563
So I guess we haven't seen you
since the wedding.

74
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,268
Oh. Yeah.

75
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,969
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

76
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,536
- You ever talk to Noah about that?
- No.

77
00:06:21,614 --> 00:06:26,677
I didn't want to. He was so mad.
I just didn't know if...

78
00:06:26,786 --> 00:06:30,449
The fire department and all.
We didn't talk about it.

79
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:34,318
Oh.

80
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:38,330
Yeah.
So I have to go back to work tomorrow.

81
00:06:38,398 --> 00:06:40,423
Oh, tomorrow? Okay. All right.
I thought it was next week.

82
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,233
And I will be gone from 8:00 to 5:00.
But sometimes until 6:00.

83
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,204
And that is when the kids have dinner.

84
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:50,538
Right.
So I will be feeding them dinner at night.

85
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,908
Making dinner for them. Okay.

86
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,379
- And breakfast, and lunch.
- Oh right. Okay.

87
00:06:55,448 --> 00:06:58,246
- No, of course, I'll do all three.
- All day.

88
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:01,286
Yeah, I know. It is feeding them. I know.

89
00:07:01,354 --> 00:07:06,917
I'll show you where everything is tonight.
You know, after the kids are in B-E-D.

90
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:11,686
- In bed?
- No, I don't want to go to bed!

91
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:14,597
No, mommy!

92
00:07:14,667 --> 00:07:15,759
Sorry.

93
00:07:17,003 --> 00:07:22,964
Yeah, so, this is the spare room.
So I thought you could just stay here.

94
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:31,573
I didn't bring a bed with me.

95
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:36,082
- This?
- Yes. The other sleeping bags are wet.

96
00:07:36,155 --> 00:07:39,090
Is that the one with vomit in it?

97
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:40,625
I can't tell.

98
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:44,561
And there is a lantern up there.
The light in that room doesn't work.

99
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:46,894
- So, you should take that.
- This?

100
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,992
No, that is a camp stove.
You can have that if you want it.

101
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,264
I don't think I'll be cooking in there. Will I?

102
00:07:52,338 --> 00:07:56,172
Whatever. It is up to you.
Do you want the tent?

103
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:01,839
Good night. I love you.

104
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:08,850
I'm really tired right now.
So I don't feel like going over everything.

105
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:11,981
Do you think you have it?

106
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:15,084
- I guess so.
- Can we just talk in the morning then?

107
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:16,890
Can I leave you a note? I'll leave you a note.

108
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:20,797
What do I do if something happens
that I have to reach you?

109
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:25,728
I have a text message, pager thing.
So, just leave me a message.

110
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,572
Okay.

111
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:32,371
You know what? That thing is really
for work. It is supposed to be for work.

112
00:08:32,445 --> 00:08:34,913
So don't page me. Do not page me.

113
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:37,814
- Okay.
- And be really quiet

114
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:39,943
when you are getting ready for bed.
They are right next door.

115
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:42,681
- Okay.
- Did you use the bathroom yet?

116
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,991
- No.
- Oh, my...

117
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:52,053
But I can wait until morning, I guess.

118
00:08:52,498 --> 00:08:54,557
That is great. Okay. Thanks. That is good.

119
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:57,330
- Good night.
- Good night.

120
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:52,613
- Mommy is leaving!
- Mommy!

121
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:59,094
Hello?

122
00:09:59,165 --> 00:10:01,429
Mommy! Mommy!

123
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,129
- Guys...
- Mommy!

124
00:10:12,678 --> 00:10:14,305
Mommy!

125
00:10:17,249 --> 00:10:21,345
Mommy, mommy!

126
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:26,187
Mommy! Mommy!

127
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:28,317
Mommy!

128
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,239
No more cookies.

129
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:28,176
- Hi.
- What are you doing?

130
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,085
I'm babysitting.

131
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,262
So, they had cereal for dinner?

132
00:11:45,337 --> 00:11:49,603
No, no, that was just a snack.

133
00:11:49,675 --> 00:11:52,667
- What did they eat for lunch?
- Sandwiches.

134
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,576
And breakfast?

135
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:00,750
What did you do all day?

136
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,688
Well, we played in their room
for a little while.

137
00:12:04,924 --> 00:12:08,519
Lincoln, we have to put underpants on
if we are going to be in polite society.

138
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,892
I don't want to be hit on the shoulder.

139
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,157
And then I gave them a bath.

140
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:19,097
Hey kids. Just stay in the bath tub, all right?
I'm almost done!

141
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:23,770
Cameron? Lincoln?

142
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,903
Where are you?

143
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,106
Lincoln? Cameron? Lincoln! Wait a minute.

144
00:12:29,181 --> 00:12:30,808
It is okay. You are okay. Come on.

145
00:12:30,883 --> 00:12:33,784
Cameron? Where are you?
You are okay, Lincoln.

146
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:37,345
- You are okay. Where is Cameron?
- I'm drowned.

147
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,687
You are not drowned. You are still talking.

148
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,718
No towels. All right, let me get you a towel.
Hold on. Cameron?

149
00:12:46,232 --> 00:12:47,460
Hey!

150
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,094
And then we went for a walk.

151
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:53,900
Cameron? Cameron, come here!
Come back here, Cameron.

152
00:12:53,973 --> 00:12:57,204
Cameron! Cameron, come here!

153
00:13:05,684 --> 00:13:10,087
And maybe we could go over stuff,
like you said you would leave in that note.

154
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:13,125
Because the note you left was fine.
Whatever.

155
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:16,684
But I couldn't really find much food
besides cereal.

156
00:13:16,762 --> 00:13:19,663
Why didn't you just walk
to the grocery store?

157
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:25,432
Oh. Well I didn't know that I could.
I mean, I will.

158
00:13:25,504 --> 00:13:27,870
I'm not against that.
I just didn't know it was an option.

159
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,398
- What is that?
- It is the mail.

160
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:35,971
- When did it come?
- Today. It is today's mail.

161
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:38,073
- This came today?
- Yeah.

162
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:42,348
This is from Noah. It is a letter from Noah.
Why didn't you page me?

163
00:13:42,421 --> 00:13:45,049
But you said not to page...

164
00:13:51,797 --> 00:13:56,860
Yeah, no. Yeah, of course.
Oh, I'm sorry. Okay. Sorry.

165
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:18,554
Come on, relax.

166
00:14:18,624 --> 00:14:20,319
Let us go!

167
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:26,628
No, no!

168
00:15:01,867 --> 00:15:03,960
I can't take you both in at once.
I'll come right back.

169
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:06,664
You are okay. It is okay. I will be right back.

170
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,798
Calm down, calm down.
Just relax. We will be right back.

171
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:10,535
Excuse me.

172
00:15:10,609 --> 00:15:13,134
- What are you doing?
- Have you kidnapped these kids?

173
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:16,978
What? No, no, no.
Their father is my brother.

174
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:19,279
All right, whatever.
Because I'm just being safe.

175
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:22,912
You would be surprised how many people
bring juvenile hostages into grocery stores.

176
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:26,924
And then it is, "Hello! AMBER alert."

177
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:31,224
Sir, we can't have you tying your child up
outside the store. It looks very bad.

178
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:35,825
They are not his kids.
Apparently he is their uncle. Or so he says.

179
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:39,860
Please, just untie the child.
This is a family store.

180
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,964
Or go over to the Shopway.

181
00:15:46,645 --> 00:15:50,046
Hold this. Cameron! Come back here.

182
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,721
Cameron, Cameron? Cameron?

183
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:05,454
All right, that is enough. Now let us go.
Now we are going home.

184
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:11,902
Hey! Hey! What? Stop it. Stop it.

185
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,099
- I hate you!
- Now Cameron, that is enough.

186
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:17,233
Now let us go. Come on.

187
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:23,038
I am going to kill you.

188
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:37,186
- This is not working.
- Yeah. Well, I tried...

189
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:40,390
Mommy, mommy,
look at this beautiful flower I drew for you.

190
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,534
That is nice Cameron, but I'm talking
to uncle Salman right now. Okay?

191
00:16:43,602 --> 00:16:44,899
I love you, mommy.

192
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,632
I love you too.
I'll look at it later on, all right?

193
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:59,910
You know, your son there
threatened to kill me today.

194
00:16:59,985 --> 00:17:03,113
- Why would you say something like that?
- Because it is true.

195
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:06,123
He told me he was going to kill me.
And you know, he had this

196
00:17:06,191 --> 00:17:08,682
incredibly cold look in his eyes.
And for a minute I just didn't know.

197
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,854
Mommy, mommy, I drew you a princess.

198
00:17:10,929 --> 00:17:12,920
This, I mean, this right now.
This, what you're seeing right now?

199
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,966
This is just a spin. This is just a front.

200
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:17,730
I mean, you don't have any idea what
this kid is like when you are not around.

201
00:17:17,803 --> 00:17:21,603
You know? I mean, he may very well be like
Damien in <i>The Omen!</i> That does happen!

202
00:17:21,673 --> 00:17:24,141
- It is possible.
- Mommy, can I sit next to you at dinner?

203
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,006
Okay. That is enough.

204
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:30,139
Okay, Cameron, dinner is going to be ready
in a minute, honey.

205
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,782
I think you should go back to Nevada.

206
00:17:40,092 --> 00:17:42,356
- I can't.
- Why not?

207
00:17:43,429 --> 00:17:47,456
I don't have any money.
I can't afford to go anywhere.

208
00:17:49,268 --> 00:17:53,170
You are thirty-two years old
and you can't afford a bus ticket?

209
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,432
No.

210
00:17:56,642 --> 00:18:00,203
Even if I did, it is not like I can just get
on the bus and go anywhere.

211
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:03,373
I don't have any money.
I can't get an apartment.

212
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:07,146
- So you don't have a credit card?
- Yes.

213
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:11,217
But it's totally...

214
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,587
Yeah.

215
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:25,295
- Hi, mommy.
- Hi.

216
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:31,558
- What are you...
- I came home for lunch.

217
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:37,766
- Okay. We were just about to...
- I may know of a job for you.

218
00:19:40,913 --> 00:19:42,210
Really?

219
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:46,780
<i>- Is it a full time job?</i>
<i>- I don't know what it is.</i>

220
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:49,514
<i>It is with maintenance or something</i>
<i>in my building at work.</i>

221
00:19:49,588 --> 00:19:51,988
<i>I just heard they were hiring</i>
<i>and I gave them your name.</i>

222
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,719
<i>- Does maintenance mean like trash pickup?</i>
<i>- I don't know.</i>

223
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:56,124
<i>Well, what are we going to do</i>
<i>about the boys?</i>

224
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:59,392
<i>If it is not full time, the boys could be</i>
<i>in day care for a couple of days.</i>

225
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:03,127
<i>- You can help me pay for that now.</i>
<i>- What is the actual job?</i>

226
00:20:03,202 --> 00:20:07,298
<i>Salman, look just go down there and</i>
<i>talk to them. I gave them your name.</i>

227
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,101
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- Yes. Say,</i> "<i>Thank you.</i>"

228
00:20:09,174 --> 00:20:10,436
<i>Thank you.</i>

229
00:20:10,509 --> 00:20:12,773
He likes me.
There is nothing I can do about it.

230
00:20:12,844 --> 00:20:16,245
I don't know why I should be in trouble
because he likes me.

231
00:20:16,315 --> 00:20:18,374
So I told her right to her face,
"You can't talk to me like that.

232
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,112
"I have been working for seven years.
And I don't have to take that."

233
00:20:21,186 --> 00:20:23,916
And I don't. And she knows that.

234
00:20:23,989 --> 00:20:26,981
And he smiled, he looked at me and I just...

235
00:20:28,093 --> 00:20:31,927
So I don't care. I didn't say anything.
She didn't say anything.

236
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,589
That is just the kind of person I am.

237
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:36,532
Is it my fault the other company's CEO
is flirting with me?

238
00:20:36,602 --> 00:20:39,196
Or if he thinks I'm cute or smart?
Or really good with PowerPoint?

239
00:20:39,271 --> 00:20:42,399
No, it is not. She can't even do her own
PowerPoint presentation.

240
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:45,443
She can't even print her handouts
three to a page on a color printer.

241
00:20:45,510 --> 00:20:49,207
But you know, because she is the manager,
it is okay.

242
00:20:49,281 --> 00:20:52,614
You know, during the meeting he said,
"Who did these slides?"

243
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:55,380
Because it is the same aqua color
I use on all my graphs.

244
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:57,354
And I didn't say anything.
Because I never say anything.

245
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:59,686
You know, do I say anything?
I never say anything.

246
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:03,956
I just do my work and keep my mouth shut.
And I don't say anything.

247
00:21:16,842 --> 00:21:20,608
- I have a job interview here.
- Job interview?

248
00:21:20,679 --> 00:21:23,773
Nobody is getting hired here.

249
00:21:23,849 --> 00:21:26,977
I think so.
This Blunexion in this building, right?

250
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:31,648
Yeah, well the whole building is Blunexion.
What is left of them.

251
00:21:31,723 --> 00:21:34,248
- What do you mean, what is left?
- Well, the market crashed

252
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:36,385
before they could get everybody moved in,
didn't it?

253
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,396
And who is working there now?
Ten people? Eight?

254
00:21:39,464 --> 00:21:44,401
For one little Internet web site.
No. There are no job interviews here.

255
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:46,369
Shit.

256
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,431
- Are you Trout?
- What?

257
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:53,000
Trout, the brother of the receptionist, Leslie.
Or whatever.

258
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:57,447
Oh, yeah, brother-in-law.
But it is Salman, not Trout.

259
00:21:57,516 --> 00:22:01,043
- Salmon?
- Salman. Like Salman Rushdie.

260
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,144
You mean, "Salman Rushdie"?

261
00:22:04,289 --> 00:22:09,989
Jesus. Whatever. Just come with me.
And thank you for your help, Edgar.

262
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,031
Get the door.

263
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,370
Come on. Keep up.

264
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,411
Take a seat.

265
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:36,115
All right. I am going to be as honest
with you as I can possibly be.

266
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:41,885
I cannot get you into the 401 K.

267
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:43,427
Oh, okay.

268
00:22:43,495 --> 00:22:45,827
They are just barely
holding this place together, as it is.

269
00:22:45,897 --> 00:22:49,594
I can't even get a haircut because of
the bullshit I'm tied into down here.

270
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,465
I thought this was a maintenance position.

271
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:54,767
Look this is the last favor
I'm doing for you guys upstairs.

272
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,207
Now if Lyle wants to come down here
and screw me over, let him do it to my face.

273
00:22:58,276 --> 00:23:02,178
I am legally required to post this job
in the paper for two weeks.

274
00:23:02,247 --> 00:23:06,343
And accept resumes from minorities
and the mentally handicapped.

275
00:23:06,418 --> 00:23:10,718
Now, I will hire you.
But this is my last favor. The last one.

276
00:23:10,789 --> 00:23:15,453
That's it. You got it?
Oh, Jesus Crap Christ. What now?

277
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:19,429
What the hell you doing, Kathleen?
Who gave you authorization to do this?

278
00:23:19,498 --> 00:23:23,457
If you must know, Ken told me to
get someone to publicize the rental space.

279
00:23:23,535 --> 00:23:26,026
- How much they paying you, dude?
- I don't know.

280
00:23:26,104 --> 00:23:29,369
I'm just trying to bring some revenue
into the building to keep up

281
00:23:29,441 --> 00:23:33,468
with the projections
that were set without my prior approval!

282
00:23:33,545 --> 00:23:36,844
You know what, Kathleen?
I don't need any of your bullshit right now!

283
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:38,143
You get off my back!

284
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:40,616
So help me God,
I am going to roast you, woman.

285
00:23:40,685 --> 00:23:43,848
- Just get out of here!
- Don't let her manipulate you, man!

286
00:23:43,922 --> 00:23:46,584
- Okay.
- Eat my mother-loving shit!

287
00:23:46,658 --> 00:23:50,754
Good one, Kathleen.
Got me on that one, didn't you?

288
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:59,997
All right. Fuck!

289
00:24:00,071 --> 00:24:02,437
Are you ready to get started?

290
00:24:03,341 --> 00:24:06,606
But what is the job?

291
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:11,377
All you have to do
is hand out flyers on the street.

292
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:14,180
It is eight... It is six dollars an hour.

293
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:17,948
And if you get someone to lease
office space, I will give you a two hundred...

294
00:24:18,023 --> 00:24:21,584
I'll give you a hundred dollar bonus.
All right?

295
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:24,322
Okay. Now, get up and come here.

296
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:27,388
I have to work every other day.
And then half day on Friday.

297
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:28,990
- Is that all right?
- Yeah, yeah. Whatever.

298
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,968
We just need to establish a street presence
to get the word out.

299
00:24:32,037 --> 00:24:34,471
- Do you suffocate?
- What?

300
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:37,474
In small spaces. Do you asphyxiate?

301
00:24:37,542 --> 00:24:42,241
Are you...
Oh, you know, agorerotic or whatever?

302
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,875
- No.
- Good. Okay, just get your feet in here.

303
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:48,078
The head is really heavy
so we will start with the body.

304
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:51,520
- Wait. I'm going to wear this?
- Well, I'm sure as hell not going to wear it.

305
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:55,754
Look, we had a shitload of luck with this
thing at a company picnic a few years back.

306
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:59,194
It is not like you have to dance around.
You just hand out flyers.

307
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:02,563
Now get your foot in there, okay? Come on.

308
00:25:02,634 --> 00:25:05,398
- I have to get my other shoe off.
- Well then, let us do it.

309
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:09,201
- Okay, other foot. That is it.
- Feels kind of weird.

310
00:25:09,274 --> 00:25:13,677
Oh this thing is going to be hot.
You are not a diabetic, are you?

311
00:25:23,088 --> 00:25:25,181
Come on!

312
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,708
Let us go, Kabluey!

313
00:25:44,943 --> 00:25:49,403
Come on, you can do it.
Just follow the sound of my voice.

314
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:54,418
Listen to me clap. Hear that?
Just follow the clapping.

315
00:25:54,486 --> 00:26:00,152
Let us go. One, two, three, four. Hey.
Whoa, whoa, Nellie, whoa. There we go.

316
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,659
- Where are we going?
- I'm going to take you out front.

317
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:05,161
You have to be out
where people can see you.

318
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:07,528
- Okay.
- Now, I'm going to

319
00:26:07,599 --> 00:26:12,161
have to put you in the front of the car.
That suit is not going to fit in the back.

320
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,864
- Is that your dog?
- Yeah, that is my dog.

321
00:26:13,939 --> 00:26:17,431
We will get to know each other on the drive.
Get into the car.

322
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:19,108
- Okay. You okay?
- Yeah.

323
00:26:19,177 --> 00:26:21,111
All right, here we go.

324
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:25,273
Don't give any flyers to assholes
who don't look serious.

325
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:29,753
I don't want to be up all fricking night
Xeroxing a whole big bunch more.

326
00:26:29,821 --> 00:26:31,083
Okay, here we go.

327
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:55,879
This is good. This is fine.

328
00:27:00,151 --> 00:27:02,711
- Okay, got the door.
- Okay, but...

329
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:07,850
I have you, come on. It is real simple.

330
00:27:08,927 --> 00:27:13,796
Here we go. Here we go.
Now, if it is too slow out here today,

331
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:15,856
- we will move you further out tomorrow.
- But...

332
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:19,370
Okay. Wait, you don't want to forget these.
No point in being out here

333
00:27:19,437 --> 00:27:22,634
if you don't have these. Here you go.

334
00:27:22,741 --> 00:27:25,733
- Okay, but...
- Okay.

335
00:27:27,412 --> 00:27:28,845
- Here, just hang on to them.
- I don't have any hands.

336
00:27:28,913 --> 00:27:30,676
Oh, for Christ sake!

337
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:36,486
There you go. There you go.
Now you are good. You are fine.

338
00:27:36,554 --> 00:27:40,490
Okay. Now if you need me...
Oh shit! My dog is puking.

339
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:43,652
- Well, if you need me, just call me.
- I don't have a cell phone.

340
00:27:43,728 --> 00:27:45,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

341
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:54,767
- You need a ride back at the end of the day?
- Yes.

342
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:58,036
All right, I'll come back and get you. Jesus.

343
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,306
Bastards!

344
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:35,312
You Blunexion assholes!

345
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:39,248
You steal my practice! You ruined my life!

346
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:44,582
How could you do this to me?
Give me back my life savings!

347
00:28:44,689 --> 00:28:45,917
Asshole!

348
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:10,438
Flyer. Flyer.

349
00:29:27,332 --> 00:29:29,732
Hey! Hey! Hey!

350
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:32,469
Help!

351
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:42,944
What the hell is that?

352
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:46,977
What is that?

353
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:58,354
- What is up buddy, what are you doing?
- I'm working.

354
00:29:58,429 --> 00:30:00,226
Are you guys interested in
renting some office space?

355
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:03,563
You are renting parts of this field
as office space?

356
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,570
Oh, no. No, no, it is...

357
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:10,768
It is a building down the road. I mean,
I don't know if you can see it from here.

358
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,810
God damn, this is trippy.

359
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:16,278
It is back over there,
and if you're interested, that would be great.

360
00:30:16,347 --> 00:30:19,316
Hey, you hot in there, man?
It is like mad hot today.

361
00:30:19,384 --> 00:30:20,851
- Yes.
- You want something to drink?

362
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:23,114
Oh sure. That would be great. Thanks.

363
00:30:23,188 --> 00:30:25,622
Jay, give me one of those brews.

364
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:31,491
- Dude.
- That echoed.

365
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:33,326
Here, hold out your hands.

366
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:36,094
Here, hold on. There you go.
Squeeze it, man.

367
00:30:36,167 --> 00:30:37,828
- Can you feel that?
- Yeah.

368
00:30:37,902 --> 00:30:40,735
- Good luck, man.
- Okay.

369
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:46,038
- Good luck, bro.
- Thanks guys. See you later.

370
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:50,809
Bye. Thanks for the beer.
I will be here hanging out.

371
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:39,178
So, how was it?

372
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,480
What are they having you do?

373
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:42,005
Hey!

374
00:34:43,314 --> 00:34:44,645
What the hell are you doing?

375
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,518
- How do you know it was him?
- How do I know it was him?

376
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,554
Who else would it be?

377
00:34:54,892 --> 00:34:58,089
Oh, and you should have seen today.
He was totally checking me out again.

378
00:34:58,162 --> 00:35:01,495
But he can't make a move, because
data streaming is a very small community.

379
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,932
And everybody would know.
But he was checking me out.

380
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:08,165
So I just went up to him,
"We should have lunch sometime."

381
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,834
Just like that. Totally casual.
You should have seen him.

382
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:15,902
Oh, he will call. He will. I know he will.

383
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:20,276
He is such a catch.
Oh my God, is that a deer?

384
00:35:35,366 --> 00:35:36,697
So, it's like you live nearby.

385
00:35:36,767 --> 00:35:39,099
And you could, like, get in your car
and drive to the office.

386
00:35:39,170 --> 00:35:42,970
And you have some office space.
And then come in every day.

387
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,545
Office space for rent.

388
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:00,315
Are you alive?

389
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,777
What do we do?

390
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,061
You are going to be okay.

391
00:36:47,138 --> 00:36:48,127
We can't call your mom. No, you are okay.

392
00:37:25,343 --> 00:37:28,904
You know, it is not like he can ask me out
even if he totally wants to.

393
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,245
Which he does. Trust me.
You look kind of strange today.

394
00:37:32,316 --> 00:37:36,150
Kind of greenish, are you okay?
Because I don't want to get sick.

395
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:45,492
Listen, can I ask you a question?

396
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:49,863
Are you a clown?

397
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:53,461
What? What do you mean? No.

398
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:57,064
But do you do children's parties?

399
00:37:58,209 --> 00:38:00,177
I don't know.

400
00:38:00,244 --> 00:38:06,308
Well, as you can see,
I have a bunch of kids who love you.

401
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:12,715
They will only let me drive them home
on this road just to see you.

402
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:25,562
Anyway, we are having a party
at our house this weekend.

403
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:29,868
So, I was wondering if you are available?

404
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,465
- Yeah. But I don't...
- $50.

405
00:38:32,543 --> 00:38:34,773
- Oh, I mean...
- $75.

406
00:38:34,845 --> 00:38:36,540
It's not that I... No, you don't have to.

407
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:42,348
$100. Final offer, okay?
The ponies are ridiculous.

408
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,048
You know what, let me get you my card.

409
00:38:55,199 --> 00:38:59,135
Actually can you put it in my hand?
My real hand.

410
00:38:59,203 --> 00:39:02,297
Oh, really? Okay.

411
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:15,281
- Thanks.
- Call me. If you are not interested.

412
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:19,187
- In fact call me, either way, will you?
- Sure.

413
00:39:21,425 --> 00:39:26,328
- Hey, sorry do you know what time it is?
- 6:27.

414
00:39:26,397 --> 00:39:28,763
Really? Because my ride
was supposed to be here at 5:45.

415
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:33,463
- Talk to you soon.
- Okay. Bye.

416
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,843
Hello? Hello!

417
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,112
Hello?

418
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:28,752
Great.

419
00:40:31,495 --> 00:40:32,894
Hello?

420
00:42:37,788 --> 00:42:39,153
- What was that?
- I don't know.

421
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:50,093
Hello?

422
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:16,518
<i>Coalition forces there</i>
<i>have recovered two bodies.</i>

423
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,926
<i>We are going now to APN's Leslie Newton</i>

424
00:43:18,996 --> 00:43:20,793
<i>who has covered this story in Baghdad.</i>

425
00:43:20,864 --> 00:43:24,527
<i>And Leslie, could you describe</i>
<i>the scale of the search</i>

426
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,093
<i>for these two men</i>
<i>over the last several days?</i>

427
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:32,473
<i>About eight thousand American forces,</i>
<i>as well as Iraqi security forces</i>

428
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:35,910
<i>are involved in this huge effort</i>

429
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:41,179
<i>to try and find the men from there, about</i>
<i>fifteen minutes after the attack took place.</i>

430
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:47,589
I am going to kill you.

431
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:56,031
<i>And now, Leslie, we are told</i>
<i>their bodies have been located.</i>

432
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:57,931
<i>Which leaves us with many questions.</i>

433
00:43:58,002 --> 00:44:00,197
<i>Some of which you may be</i>
<i>able to answer today.</i>

434
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:03,205
<i>And some of which you may not.</i>
<i>Who took them?</i>

435
00:44:03,273 --> 00:44:05,969
<i>How were they treated? Were they tortured?</i>

436
00:44:06,043 --> 00:44:08,477
<i>What condition were they in</i>
<i>when they were found?</i>

437
00:44:08,545 --> 00:44:12,208
<i>Where are the bodies now? And have</i>
<i>the families of the soldiers been notified?</i>

438
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:25,158
- I want ice cream!
- You have had enough sugar today.

439
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:27,220
No I haven't!

440
00:44:34,371 --> 00:44:35,497
Whoa.

441
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:49,108
Would you like to try
our delicious new fat free Gouda?

442
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:54,419
Would you like to try
our delicious new fat free Gouda?

443
00:44:54,491 --> 00:44:55,651
Yeah!

444
00:44:58,228 --> 00:45:03,530
Listen, will you run in there and get some
plastic wrap and sandwich bags?

445
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:06,559
Okay. What are you guys going to do?

446
00:45:07,705 --> 00:45:11,334
- We are going to get our faces painted.
- Okay, over there?

447
00:45:12,743 --> 00:45:15,211
- Yeah.
- All right. I'll go in, buy the stuff

448
00:45:15,279 --> 00:45:17,839
and meet you back right there
in two minutes.

449
00:45:17,915 --> 00:45:19,644
I'll be right back.

450
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:27,423
All right, come on you guys, let us go.

451
00:45:27,491 --> 00:45:29,482
All right, don't step in it.

452
00:45:30,594 --> 00:45:34,360
Sandwich... Sandwich... Sandwich bags.

453
00:45:34,431 --> 00:45:38,561
Oh, excuse me. Could you reach
a few boxes of that tin foil for me?

454
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:46,303
Yes. Here you go.

455
00:45:48,045 --> 00:45:49,945
Thank you very much.

456
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,050
Hi.

457
00:46:07,965 --> 00:46:10,160
That will be $8.09.

458
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,003
I don't have any money with me.

459
00:46:15,072 --> 00:46:17,870
Can I just run outside,
and I'll be right back?

460
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:21,004
You want to just take it?

461
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:22,705
What? No.

462
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:26,375
It is okay, our inventory system
is totally screwed up.

463
00:46:27,317 --> 00:46:31,253
- No.
- Hey, you want some watermelon?

464
00:46:32,189 --> 00:46:34,919
Not that bruised. Pretty tasty.

465
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:38,018
No. I'll just... My sister-in-law...
I'll be right back.

466
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:42,758
And where do you think you are going?
Get your butt back out there.

467
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:46,335
Oh, you think that is funny?

468
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:49,736
Okay then, why don't you take second shift
inside Mr. Fromage?

469
00:46:49,807 --> 00:46:53,106
What? Oh, come on Frank. No!

470
00:46:53,844 --> 00:46:56,005
Hey, I need some money for the stuff.

471
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,007
It is in my purse, behind me.

472
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:02,044
Wait.

473
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:15,424
Here.

474
00:47:16,867 --> 00:47:19,893
Okay. Thanks. I'll be right back.

475
00:47:42,459 --> 00:47:46,987
God damn. Well, what in the hell
is the service pump?

476
00:47:49,266 --> 00:47:50,995
- Hey, Kathleen?
- What?

477
00:47:51,735 --> 00:47:53,862
Oh, it is you. What do you want?

478
00:47:53,937 --> 00:47:57,998
Are you working today?
Crap, I didn't make any new flyers.

479
00:47:58,075 --> 00:48:01,101
I'll tell you what, just go out anyway.
Just make yourself known.

480
00:48:01,178 --> 00:48:03,476
Do you know anything about electricity?

481
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:04,673
Actually, I'm not working today.

482
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:07,342
I just wanted to know
if I could borrow the suit for a few hours.

483
00:48:07,417 --> 00:48:09,146
Borrow the what?

484
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:14,190
Sorry!

485
00:48:14,925 --> 00:48:16,756
Jesus Christ, relax, bitch.

486
00:48:17,628 --> 00:48:19,493
Now what did you say?
Can you borrow the what?

487
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:22,430
The suit. I want to borrow it, briefly.

488
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,669
- For what?
- Well there is this party.

489
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:29,706
And this woman will pay me to be there
and entertain, in the suit.

490
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:31,570
You are not going to get jizz on it, are you?

491
00:48:31,642 --> 00:48:33,735
What? Oh, no.

492
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:36,506
Is this one of those plushy things?
Because I don't know about that.

493
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:39,310
I mean, unless you want to pay
for the dry cleaning. No. Even then, no.

494
00:48:39,383 --> 00:48:42,910
No, it is just a kid's birthday party.
I'll just be there for like an hour.

495
00:48:42,986 --> 00:48:47,446
I could use the money. And I just thought
I'd ask before I took the suit.

496
00:48:50,294 --> 00:48:53,161
- Just bring it back in one piece.
- Okay.

497
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:57,899
- And clean... Bring it back clean.
- Okay.

498
00:48:58,535 --> 00:49:00,002
Clean.

499
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:03,131
Shit.

500
00:49:14,518 --> 00:49:17,851
Oh. I'm sorry, I didn't realize
this was a changing room.

501
00:49:19,056 --> 00:49:21,456
Oh. Hello.

502
00:49:23,026 --> 00:49:26,621
- Are you working here?
- Today I am. We are catering this.

503
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:32,265
- What are you doing?
- I'm the entertainment for the kids.

504
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:33,860
Just like John Wayne Gacy.

505
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:36,963
No, I'm just getting paid
to be here for the party.

506
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:42,134
Look, can you do my zipper
and help me with the head?

507
00:49:42,212 --> 00:49:44,772
I can't get in and out of this thing by myself.

508
00:49:48,885 --> 00:49:52,548
All right everybody, I have a big surprise.
Have a seat. Have a seat.

509
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:56,217
Are you ready? Ready? Here we go.

510
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:10,933
Yay!

511
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:13,838
Come on, let us take this outside.

512
00:51:52,476 --> 00:51:54,876
And my dad, he is on a boat
and he went to the desert.

513
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:57,641
And there are tanks.
And he can blow up stuff if he wants to.

514
00:51:57,714 --> 00:52:01,980
He can do stuff,
like he can blow up cactuses.

515
00:52:05,522 --> 00:52:07,752
Hey! A pony!

516
00:52:26,042 --> 00:52:28,237
I heard about the accident.

517
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:29,903
No, I didn't invite them.

518
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,710
Apparently, the neighbors
have some sort of restraining order.

519
00:52:32,782 --> 00:52:34,409
No, it is a lovely party, really.

520
00:52:34,484 --> 00:52:36,816
I just have to get ahold of my locations.

521
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:41,688
Great work.
Can you stay until after the ponies go?

522
00:52:41,758 --> 00:52:45,694
Here, have a piece of cake.
And don't let me forget to pay you.

523
00:52:46,563 --> 00:52:50,124
Boo-freaking-hoo, I feel so sorry for you
because you have eight zillion dollars

524
00:52:50,200 --> 00:52:51,565
and your company went under.

525
00:52:51,635 --> 00:52:54,160
I mean, I'm just not that sympathetic to him.

526
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:58,901
I'm good. I'm better. I have been running.

527
00:52:58,975 --> 00:53:01,944
Like twenty five miles a day.
I can probably do a triathlon.

528
00:53:02,012 --> 00:53:04,242
Believe me, I heard it firsthand.

529
00:53:04,314 --> 00:53:06,544
Well, you know, I know it for a fact.

530
00:53:06,616 --> 00:53:09,050
He has been gone forever,
these things happen.

531
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:12,418
That poor guy.
When does he come home from Iraq?

532
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:15,083
Well, it was supposed to be
a few months ago.

533
00:53:15,158 --> 00:53:17,422
But you know,
they extended everybody over there.

534
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:18,859
I saw that graph in <i>USA Today.</i>

535
00:53:18,929 --> 00:53:20,863
- Oh yeah.
- So terrible.

536
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:23,993
Do you think he has any idea?

537
00:53:25,468 --> 00:53:28,301
Tell me, tell me...

538
00:53:28,738 --> 00:53:32,902
What I heard was that they have probably
been together the whole time.

539
00:53:32,976 --> 00:53:34,409
Even before he left.

540
00:53:34,477 --> 00:53:39,141
Liz says she is going to leave him for Brad,
her boss. Can you believe that?

541
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:42,117
If she was smart she would leave him
before what's-his-name gets back from Iran.

542
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:43,584
- Iraq.
- Oh, whatever.

543
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:45,450
- And they have two kids, right?
- Yes.

544
00:53:45,522 --> 00:53:48,650
- Oh, Rita! Hi! How are you?
- Oh, my God.

545
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:51,785
She just turned to him and said,
"I want out of the marriage."

546
00:53:51,861 --> 00:53:54,796
I just don't enjoy myself anymore,
you know?

547
00:53:54,864 --> 00:53:59,062
I can't even answer the phone.
I just sit there in the darkness.

548
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:02,161
- I need a drink.
- Okay.

549
00:54:05,041 --> 00:54:06,702
What do I do?

550
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:47,772
Nice seeing you guys. Bye-bye, buddy.
Jamie. Good to see you.

551
00:54:48,918 --> 00:54:53,321
- I wonder where their mother is?
- Oh, where do you think?

552
00:54:53,957 --> 00:54:56,983
Are you going to drive them home?

553
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,961
Please. I'm sure John will, eventually.

554
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:02,692
You think I can call them a cab?

555
00:55:02,766 --> 00:55:06,224
- Is that inappropriate?
- Oh my gosh, a key.

556
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:10,406
- You are so bad.
- No, me? Please.

557
00:55:11,041 --> 00:55:14,807
I mean seriously. Don't they have a nanny
or an au pair living with them?

558
00:55:14,878 --> 00:55:19,508
Oh yeah, but have you seen him?
He is totally bizarre.

559
00:55:19,582 --> 00:55:21,015
I can't handle it.

560
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:23,518
You have to hire good help.

561
00:55:23,586 --> 00:55:25,645
- It is all about good help.
- Poor kids.

562
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:34,988
Damn it.

563
00:56:31,388 --> 00:56:33,447
- Hi.
- Hi.

564
00:56:35,325 --> 00:56:36,656
Come in.

565
00:56:49,906 --> 00:56:52,033
You were inside there?

566
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:53,934
Yes.

567
00:56:55,311 --> 00:56:57,939
That thing was you?

568
00:57:03,686 --> 00:57:07,918
- Okay now, are you guys ready to go home?
- Yes.

569
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:13,859
Oh, hi. I'm here to pick up
Cameron and Lincoln.

570
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,792
- And you are?
- Their uncle.

571
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:20,528
Right. Well, I don't know where they are.

572
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:22,468
- Oh, here they are now.
- Here you go.

573
00:57:22,539 --> 00:57:25,804
- Coincidence.
- The head didn't fit in the trunk.

574
00:57:25,875 --> 00:57:28,207
- So I just stuffed it under the seat.
- Okay.

575
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,872
Okay. So, thanks. That is all. Thank you.

576
00:57:30,947 --> 00:57:34,246
Oh. And also, Barbara,
the woman with the thing.

577
00:57:34,317 --> 00:57:37,047
She thinks that you have gained
a lot of weight.

578
00:57:37,120 --> 00:57:40,055
But I think that, that is just because
she was talking to Nancy.

579
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:43,320
Who says that Jane is sleeping
with your husband.

580
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:46,021
And you don't know about it. Okay, thanks.

581
00:57:46,863 --> 00:57:47,989
What?

582
00:57:57,540 --> 00:57:59,030
- Hi, Leslie.
- Hi.

583
00:57:59,108 --> 00:58:02,737
Oh... Oh, the party is over.

584
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:07,010
I know, I'm sorry. How are you? Hi.

585
00:58:08,551 --> 00:58:10,416
- Hi, Leslie. How are you?
- Good.

586
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:15,989
So, I just came to get the kids.
Are they playing?

587
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:18,687
Oh, no, no. They are gone.

588
00:58:18,761 --> 00:58:20,729
- That Salamander...
- Salman.

589
00:58:20,797 --> 00:58:22,822
Whatever his name is.
He came to pick them up.

590
00:58:22,899 --> 00:58:24,000
I thought you knew.

591
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:24,591
I thought you knew.

592
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:27,628
No, I did. I did. I just wasn't sure.

593
00:58:27,704 --> 00:58:32,732
All right. Well do you want to stay
and have a glass of wine or chai?

594
00:58:33,276 --> 00:58:35,073
I have to get going.

595
00:58:35,144 --> 00:58:36,975
But thanks anyway.

596
00:58:37,046 --> 00:58:39,014
- Say hi to Harold for me, Beth, okay?
- I will.

597
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:41,482
- Bye, Betty. Thanks a lot.
- Rain check, okay.

598
00:58:41,551 --> 00:58:45,385
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

599
00:58:46,222 --> 00:58:49,385
Okay. The fire engine light is on.

600
00:58:49,459 --> 00:58:51,950
And let us see,
we have the curtains half way open.

601
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:53,859
The teeth are mostly brushed.

602
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:55,921
And your story book is right here.

603
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:58,263
I'm not going to read it.
Your mom will do that when she gets here.

604
00:58:58,334 --> 00:59:03,397
I think that is it. So we are ready for bed.
Time for bed.

605
00:59:07,944 --> 00:59:10,469
What are you doing? What is going on?

606
00:59:12,081 --> 00:59:15,642
- We have a question.
- Okay. What is it?

607
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:18,881
Can you fly?

608
00:59:22,125 --> 00:59:23,183
No.

609
00:59:23,259 --> 00:59:25,352
Well, can you shoot lasers out of your eyes?

610
00:59:25,428 --> 00:59:26,690
What? No.

611
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:29,288
Melt him. Melt him with your eyes.
Quick before Mommy gets home.

612
00:59:29,365 --> 00:59:31,424
Hey, hey. Hey. No.

613
00:59:32,635 --> 00:59:35,229
I'm not a bad guy.

614
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:39,298
I'm for good. I'm a good guy.

615
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,608
You are here to protect us?

616
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:46,575
Yes.

617
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:48,344
And mom?

618
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:51,948
Yes. For now.

619
00:59:57,527 --> 01:00:00,189
Here, read us our story.

620
01:00:05,768 --> 01:00:06,894
Okay.

621
01:00:13,242 --> 01:00:14,937
- No, you.
- Let's cover you up here.

622
01:00:15,011 --> 01:00:18,310
Hello? Salman? Hello?

623
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:22,640
Oh, there they are. Okay.

624
01:00:22,719 --> 01:00:27,383
- Peppie tonight?
- No, no. Here we go, let us put him in there.

625
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:30,449
I got to the party a little late
to pick them up.

626
01:00:30,526 --> 01:00:32,687
And they were gone.

627
01:00:32,762 --> 01:00:35,287
- No, I got them.
- Well, I figured.

628
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:37,490
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

629
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:41,095
- Okay, here you go.
- You go to bed.

630
01:00:41,170 --> 01:00:42,398
I'm going to go to bed.

631
01:00:42,472 --> 01:00:45,032
Do you have their book? The story book?

632
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:46,769
Yeah. We did that.

633
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:51,209
Okay, okay. Good night. Good night.

634
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:54,306
- You.
- Okay, you go to sleep.

635
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:56,511
And this goes right here.

636
01:00:57,787 --> 01:01:01,621
Okay. Now, which night light?

637
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:06,085
Anubis, Egyptian jackal god,
or melted football shape?

638
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:07,686
- Melted football shape.
- Egyptian.

639
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:21,636
Yeah so, they are asleep now.

640
01:01:23,813 --> 01:01:26,111
And you know I have Wednesday off.
So I thought maybe

641
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:28,776
I could take them to the zoo. On Wednesday.

642
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,654
I think they would like that.

643
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,548
When are you leaving?

644
01:01:37,894 --> 01:01:39,486
What do you mean?

645
01:01:39,562 --> 01:01:42,690
Well, you must have enough money
for a bus ticket now.

646
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:46,362
But Noah doesn't get home
for another four months.

647
01:01:46,436 --> 01:01:47,960
And?

648
01:01:50,206 --> 01:01:53,073
Well, I thought you said
you couldn't afford the day care?

649
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:59,642
I think I can probably manage it now.
My boss gave me a raise.

650
01:02:09,025 --> 01:02:10,959
Well, I don't mind staying.

651
01:02:11,027 --> 01:02:13,052
It is up to you, I guess.

652
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:51,093
Her? That whore can piss off!
I don't know who she thinks she is.

653
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:53,727
Feeding me all that bullshit every day.

654
01:02:53,803 --> 01:02:56,863
Oh yeah, she is going to sleep with him.
And then he won't call her.

655
01:02:56,939 --> 01:02:59,806
And who is going to have to
hear about it every day?

656
01:02:59,876 --> 01:03:05,644
That bitch. I'm really tired of her
yakking all the time.

657
01:03:05,715 --> 01:03:08,309
Why would I care? I don't know her.

658
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:13,754
She just yaps all the time
about how wonderful she is.

659
01:03:13,823 --> 01:03:15,814
And about how great this guy is.

660
01:03:15,892 --> 01:03:18,884
Anyway, what is going on with you?

661
01:03:19,529 --> 01:03:22,430
Did you get that thing burnt off your head?

662
01:04:24,227 --> 01:04:26,252
Oh, wow. What is this?

663
01:04:27,997 --> 01:04:29,123
Hey.

664
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:34,902
Hi. Are you selling fireworks or something?

665
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:38,740
- Berries?
- I work for Blunexion.

666
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:42,007
We are renting out office space.

667
01:04:46,015 --> 01:04:49,212
Oh. I see.

668
01:04:54,891 --> 01:04:58,622
- Come on. Let us go.
- Hey, this guy works for your company.

669
01:05:01,264 --> 01:05:04,597
Yeah. A shit-load of good he does us.
Come on, let us go.

670
01:05:05,201 --> 01:05:07,294
Well, very nice to meet you.

671
01:05:07,803 --> 01:05:09,668
What the hell is that?

672
01:05:10,740 --> 01:05:14,801
Jesus, those flyers don't grow on trees.
Pull it together, huh?

673
01:05:15,945 --> 01:05:19,176
So anyway, have a nice day.

674
01:07:12,628 --> 01:07:14,152
Hey!

675
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:26,938
Hey, what is going on?

676
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:36,281
I will be right back.

677
01:07:54,904 --> 01:07:56,030
Hi.

678
01:07:57,907 --> 01:08:00,603
I'm ready.

679
01:08:12,988 --> 01:08:16,287
Say cheese, assholes!

680
01:08:18,094 --> 01:08:20,028
Come here, you!

681
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:25,695
Stop it!

682
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:28,530
Stop it!

683
01:08:33,175 --> 01:08:34,733
Ha! I didn't feel that at all!

684
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,385
Stop it!

685
01:08:52,094 --> 01:08:55,655
Whoa! You! You get away from her!

686
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:11,975
You paged me?

687
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:17,274
Leslie, call the police.
We are being attacked.

688
01:09:17,353 --> 01:09:22,222
By cheese! And that blue thing
is trying to kill us.

689
01:09:29,131 --> 01:09:31,224
Look at these Polaroids.

690
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:32,631
He is sleeping with her.

691
01:09:32,701 --> 01:09:35,261
They were about... Look at this photo.
He was about to have sex with her.

692
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:37,635
Right before we got here.
He is having an affair with her.

693
01:09:37,706 --> 01:09:38,968
He is having an affair with both of you.

694
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:42,533
He is a bad guy.
You can't leave Noah for him.

695
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:46,604
What are you doing?
They have two kids at home.

696
01:09:50,419 --> 01:09:52,319
He is sleeping with her too.

697
01:09:52,388 --> 01:09:53,855
He is sleeping with both of you.

698
01:09:53,923 --> 01:09:55,754
You can't leave Noah.

699
01:09:58,460 --> 01:10:00,792
You stay the hell away from her!

700
01:10:13,709 --> 01:10:15,973
What is going on here?

701
01:10:58,554 --> 01:10:59,782
No.

702
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:55,165
- I love your brother.
- Okay.

703
01:12:56,605 --> 01:13:00,132
- I wasn't in love with...
- Yeah. That is okay. It is okay.

704
01:13:00,609 --> 01:13:04,875
- Okay. I wasn't going to leave Noah.
- Yeah. It is okay. I believe you.

705
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:12,187
I wasn't expecting this.

706
01:13:12,988 --> 01:13:17,015
That Noah would just go away.
I mean, I knew it could happen.

707
01:13:17,092 --> 01:13:20,994
Abstractly, I knew it could happen.
I didn't think it would actually happen.

708
01:13:21,764 --> 01:13:23,994
That I would be this war bride.

709
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:30,169
I mean, and then he was just gone.
Just gone.

710
01:13:35,611 --> 01:13:40,207
And Brad... And I just...

711
01:13:40,282 --> 01:13:42,978
A year and a half is a really long time.

712
01:13:50,893 --> 01:13:52,258
- Mommy.
- Yeah?

713
01:13:52,694 --> 01:13:57,722
- The lizard is gone.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

714
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:07,632
I love your brother. I do. I do.

715
01:14:09,378 --> 01:14:11,642
- Yeah, I know.
- I do.

716
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:14,138
I believe you.

717
01:14:19,955 --> 01:14:22,753
Cameron, what did we say
about the hammer?

718
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:29,121
- It is my fault. I gave it to him.
- Oh.

719
01:14:29,264 --> 01:14:33,223
- Do you want me take it away?
- Probably not a great toy.

720
01:14:33,302 --> 01:14:37,762
- Okay. Sorry.
- It is all right, thank you.

721
01:15:46,108 --> 01:15:48,303
Is that too tight? Okay.

722
01:15:52,047 --> 01:15:54,982
Okay. Go get your coats on.
Get your coats, we have to go.

723
01:15:56,451 --> 01:15:58,078
Hey, guys cut it out!

724
01:15:58,153 --> 01:16:01,054
Cameron, help your brother up
and apologize.

725
01:16:05,327 --> 01:16:06,555
And?

726
01:16:07,329 --> 01:16:10,321
Sorry, friends forever.

727
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:15,400
Let go. Stop hugging me.

728
01:16:54,943 --> 01:16:57,468
I thought we were going to pick him up?

729
01:17:03,151 --> 01:17:04,516
It is okay.

730
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:56,636
Okay, go on. It is okay. That is your dad.

731
01:17:56,705 --> 01:17:58,935
It is okay. Go on.
