2
00:01:24,924 --> 00:01:26,484
All clear.

3
00:02:05,275 --> 00:02:06,966
Shh.

4
00:02:07,132 --> 00:02:08,474
Ali.

5
00:03:23,644 --> 00:03:26,425
<i>Do we belong there? Do we not?</i>

6
00:03:27,228 --> 00:03:29,235
<i>It doesn't matter
how you would answer that...</i>

7
00:03:29,403 --> 00:03:33,561
<i>...because we are there.
We're tired, and we can't see the end.</i>

8
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:38,199
<i>We can't even console ourselves
that our enemy is just as tired as we are.</i>

9
00:03:38,973 --> 00:03:40,401
<i>Because they're not.</i>

10
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:48,954
<i>It is a fallacy that prolonged war
will weaken an occupied enemy.</i>

11
00:03:49,116 --> 00:03:50,098
He's dead.

12
00:03:50,268 --> 00:03:53,463
<i>It most likely
will make your enemy stronger.</i>

13
00:03:53,628 --> 00:03:57,043
<i>They get used to the deprivation,
and they adapt and respond accordingly.</i>

14
00:03:58,685 --> 00:04:00,311
While here at home...

15
00:04:00,475 --> 00:04:04,699
<i>The explosion occurred in one of
Manchester's heavily Asian neighborhoods.</i>

16
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,388
...with every death reported...

17
00:04:06,556 --> 00:04:10,681
...we have to deal with a public-opinion
trajectory that slides rapidly...

18
00:04:10,843 --> 00:04:14,521
...from supportive to negative
to downright hostile.

19
00:04:15,132 --> 00:04:19,026
People just get sick and tired
of a moment's silence at a ball game.

20
00:04:19,771 --> 00:04:21,747
They just wanna be told that it's over.

21
00:04:21,917 --> 00:04:24,283
<i>Police and emergency
workers in Manchester...</i>

22
00:04:24,444 --> 00:04:27,194
<i>...are still combing through what is left
of this block of flats.</i>

23
00:04:27,355 --> 00:04:28,882
<i>They say this was not the target.</i>

24
00:04:29,052 --> 00:04:32,533
<i>Had the bombs being constructed here
found their eventual intended target...</i>

25
00:04:32,701 --> 00:04:33,846
<i>...the devastation could...</i>

26
00:04:34,012 --> 00:04:35,605
Despite the fact...

27
00:04:35,773 --> 00:04:38,675
...we have markedly increased
our operational intensity...

28
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:41,242
...we're not seeing any progress.

29
00:04:42,269 --> 00:04:44,122
What we're dealing with here...

30
00:04:44,283 --> 00:04:47,382
...is potentially a global conflagration...

31
00:04:47,548 --> 00:04:51,192
...that requires constant diligence
in order to suppress.

32
00:04:52,605 --> 00:04:54,514
Now, you see...

33
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:57,939
...because our enemy...

34
00:04:58,108 --> 00:05:02,898
...has realized that they are fighting guys
from the future.

35
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,213
Now, ahem, it is brilliant
as it is infuriating.

36
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:12,658
If you live like it's the past,
and you behave like it's the past...

37
00:05:12,827 --> 00:05:16,024
...then guys from the future
find it very hard to see you.

38
00:05:16,187 --> 00:05:19,571
If you throw away your cell phone,
shut down your e-mail...

39
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:23,636
<i>...pass all your instructions face-to-face,
hand-to-hand...</i>

40
00:05:23,805 --> 00:05:26,935
<i>...turn your back on technology
and just disappear into the crowd...</i>

41
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,817
<i>No flags. No uniforms.</i>

42
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,981
<i>You got your basic grunts
on the ground there.</i>

43
00:05:33,148 --> 00:05:35,384
<i>They're looking going,
"Who is it we're fighting?"</i>

44
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:39,987
<i>In a situation like this,
your friends dress just like your enemies...</i>

45
00:05:40,156 --> 00:05:42,545
<i>...and your enemies dress
like your friends.</i>

46
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:47,704
What I need you to fully understand is that
these people, they do not wanna negotiate.

47
00:05:47,869 --> 00:05:49,298
Not at all.

48
00:05:49,468 --> 00:05:53,526
<i>They want the universal caliphate
established across the face of the Earth...</i>

49
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:59,034
<i>...and they want every infidel converted
or dead.</i>

50
00:06:01,757 --> 00:06:03,862
So, what's changed...

51
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:07,483
...is that our
allegedly unsophisticated enemy...

52
00:06:07,644 --> 00:06:10,841
...has cottoned on
to the factually unsophisticated truth...

53
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:12,279
...we're an easy target.

54
00:06:12,444 --> 00:06:15,062
<i>We are an easy target...</i>

55
00:06:15,228 --> 00:06:18,610
<i>...and our world as we know it
is a lot simpler...</i>

56
00:06:18,781 --> 00:06:21,747
...to put to an end than you might think.

57
00:06:22,555 --> 00:06:25,817
We take our foot off the throat
of this enemy for one minute...

58
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,151
...and our world changes completely.

59
00:06:28,315 --> 00:06:30,105
Thank you, Mr. Hoffman.

60
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:43,062
BASSAM

61
00:06:43,644 --> 00:06:45,237
I'm coming.

62
00:06:51,581 --> 00:06:53,141
You're early.

63
00:06:54,108 --> 00:06:55,516
Big boss man, what's happening?

64
00:06:58,172 --> 00:06:59,798
What's the story?

65
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:01,208
Rules of the day.

66
00:07:01,372 --> 00:07:03,543
If the car gets immobilized,
start shooting.

67
00:07:03,709 --> 00:07:05,781
Nobody gets traded. Everybody dies.

68
00:07:05,947 --> 00:07:07,639
So same as every day?

69
00:07:07,805 --> 00:07:10,521
- You got it. Want some breakfast?
- Hell, yes.

70
00:07:11,485 --> 00:07:12,466
Thanks.

71
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:15,096
All right. Tell me something real.

72
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:17,846
<i>Oh, all I got is real, man. You know me.</i>

73
00:07:18,012 --> 00:07:19,189
All right, let's hear it.

74
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:22,803
All right, a guy named Nizar.

75
00:07:22,973 --> 00:07:25,077
He's from Aquiz up near Tikrit, right?

76
00:07:25,245 --> 00:07:28,560
So he gets all fucked in his head
after the invasion, you know?

77
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:31,252
He starts working with the Baathists,
then the jihadists.

78
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:34,418
But he is scared shitless now, man.

79
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:36,889
He's supposed
to do a martyrdom operation...

80
00:07:37,052 --> 00:07:39,026
...but he doesn't wanna fucking die.

81
00:07:39,197 --> 00:07:41,237
So he's coming to us.

82
00:07:41,403 --> 00:07:42,713
- He's coming to us?
- Mm-hm.

83
00:07:44,156 --> 00:07:45,716
For chrissakes, move the donkey.

84
00:07:47,677 --> 00:07:50,394
Move it, let's go.
Get these guys moving. Let's go.

85
00:07:50,557 --> 00:07:52,793
Come on, come on.

86
00:07:52,956 --> 00:07:55,574
Oh, my God. Just get the...
Buy the fucking flowers.

87
00:07:57,947 --> 00:07:59,769
Come on, come on.

88
00:07:59,932 --> 00:08:02,583
So, what are the chances
your man's playing both sides?

89
00:08:02,747 --> 00:08:04,788
I don't know. What are they with me?

90
00:08:04,956 --> 00:08:06,843
Three to one.

91
00:08:07,002 --> 00:08:08,312
All right. Let's slow down.

92
00:08:08,475 --> 00:08:09,882
Is this it?

93
00:08:10,045 --> 00:08:13,043
Yeah. This is it.

94
00:08:13,211 --> 00:08:16,146
Nitrate 37 slewing to target ports now.

95
00:08:16,317 --> 00:08:17,778
01 L2MDT.

96
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:19,988
On target, 15:31 Zulu.

97
00:08:20,156 --> 00:08:22,011
Cell phone linked to moving vehicle.

98
00:08:22,173 --> 00:08:23,766
<i>Stop right up here.</i>

99
00:08:23,932 --> 00:08:27,096
Right up here. Let me take a look.

100
00:08:30,173 --> 00:08:32,692
- I don't see anything.
I'm gonna call him.

101
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,649
All right, call him.

102
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:40,051
<i>Bassam.</i>

103
00:08:40,221 --> 00:08:41,780
Yeah, Nizar.

104
00:08:45,148 --> 00:08:46,129
NIZAR:

105
00:08:46,298 --> 00:08:47,413
Huh?

106
00:08:47,578 --> 00:08:49,206
NIZAR:

107
00:08:49,373 --> 00:08:50,485
IR 3.9.

108
00:08:50,652 --> 00:08:54,034
- He says he wants one of us to come in.
He is to meet inside the car.

109
00:08:54,203 --> 00:08:56,592
Inside the car.
If he wants to talk, it's in the car.

110
00:08:56,763 --> 00:08:59,350
You have to come to us, Nizar.

111
00:08:59,517 --> 00:09:02,004
- I'm coming to you.
- Do the fuck what I said. Go.

112
00:09:03,068 --> 00:09:04,823
Hey, hey. Listen to me.

113
00:09:04,989 --> 00:09:07,158
I am not getting my head cut off
on the Internet.

114
00:09:07,323 --> 00:09:08,730
If something happens, shoot me.

115
00:09:08,892 --> 00:09:11,926
- Will you shoot me?
- Fuck that shit. I will shoot you right now.

116
00:09:12,091 --> 00:09:14,197
- I'm not kidding.
- Quit being a pussy.

117
00:09:18,203 --> 00:09:19,350
Nizar.

118
00:09:21,563 --> 00:09:23,091
Zooming in.

119
00:09:23,259 --> 00:09:24,754
Visual confirmed.

120
00:09:25,437 --> 00:09:27,258
Long wave 10.7.

121
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,365
Shit.

122
00:09:37,532 --> 00:09:40,379
- I can't talk right now, Larry.
- She wants the house.

123
00:09:40,539 --> 00:09:43,028
<i>Give her the house.
It's a piece of shit, all right?</i>

124
00:09:43,196 --> 00:09:45,269
- We're getting this, sir.
- We're getting it.

125
00:09:45,436 --> 00:09:48,119
She can ask for whatever she wants,
but I'm not listening.

126
00:09:48,284 --> 00:09:50,673
<i>What the hell are you calling for?
Hang up the phone.</i>

127
00:09:50,844 --> 00:09:52,250
Hang up the phone.

128
00:09:54,236 --> 00:09:55,665
Are you on the line?

129
00:09:55,836 --> 00:09:58,422
I can see you now, all right?
You are attracting attention.

130
00:09:58,588 --> 00:10:01,817
Get the fuck out of here right now.
I will handle this on my own.

131
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:03,158
Roger that. Off target.

132
00:10:03,964 --> 00:10:06,418
Copy. Off target, 3-10.

133
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:12,212
FERRIS

134
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:13,938
Yes.

135
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:15,451
Good, good, good.

136
00:10:18,397 --> 00:10:21,561
You want an orange? You hungry?

137
00:10:21,725 --> 00:10:22,803
No.

138
00:10:26,236 --> 00:10:28,571
So, Nizar...

139
00:10:28,731 --> 00:10:30,456
...why'd you come to me, huh?

140
00:10:31,004 --> 00:10:32,892
I know too many things.

141
00:10:34,331 --> 00:10:36,820
They prepared me to go outside Iraq.

142
00:10:38,076 --> 00:10:40,693
What do you mean by "outside Iraq"?

143
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,088
They said they need me
to become shahid...

144
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:46,193
...for martyrdom.

145
00:10:46,364 --> 00:10:49,681
When a man knows too much,
they say martyrdom.

146
00:10:49,851 --> 00:10:53,496
Who do you mean by "they," Nizar? Hm?

147
00:10:59,036 --> 00:11:01,139
I don't want to die.

148
00:11:03,227 --> 00:11:05,366
I want to go to America.

149
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,245
I have a Ph. D., you know?

150
00:11:08,413 --> 00:11:11,162
And they want me...
They want me to blow myself up.

151
00:11:11,644 --> 00:11:14,327
- Ph. D. In what, chemistry?
- No.

152
00:11:14,491 --> 00:11:16,563
What do you know
about radiological materials?

153
00:11:16,731 --> 00:11:19,698
Linguistic. I speak five languages.
Five, you know?

154
00:11:19,866 --> 00:11:21,908
Nobody should say "martyr" to me.
Nobody.

155
00:11:22,076 --> 00:11:24,562
- You are a rare and a delicate flower.
- Yes, I am.

156
00:11:24,732 --> 00:11:25,715
- Yes.
- Yes.

157
00:11:25,884 --> 00:11:28,600
So you don't wanna kill the Jews
and the Crusaders, huh?

158
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:31,831
What do you know about our pain?

159
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,355
Cut the bullshit, all right?

160
00:11:34,524 --> 00:11:36,530
Give me some information.
What do you know?

161
00:11:41,917 --> 00:11:44,915
You know,
I know enough to be martyred.

162
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:48,248
But with you,
I know enough to stay alive.

163
00:11:53,851 --> 00:11:55,793
You have a computer?

164
00:12:12,764 --> 00:12:14,705
<i>- Yup.
Hey, Ed, it's me.</i>

165
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:17,558
I got an Iraqi walk-in, up near Samarra.

166
00:12:17,724 --> 00:12:21,269
He's got a communiqu� video here that
somebody walked across the Iranian border.

167
00:12:21,437 --> 00:12:23,192
I'm watching it right now, sir.

168
00:12:23,804 --> 00:12:25,812
<i>- Can you see his face?
- Yes, captain.</i>

169
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,835
<i>I am looking at the white whale.</i>

170
00:12:28,283 --> 00:12:30,520
<i>- It is Al-Saleem.
- What's he saying?</i>

171
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:31,894
<i>Well, it's gotta be current.</i>

172
00:12:32,059 --> 00:12:34,230
He mentions the Sheffield bus bombings
a week ago.

173
00:12:34,394 --> 00:12:37,942
He's telling the brothers to prepare for
a UK operation's already planned...

174
00:12:38,109 --> 00:12:41,490
...which is the bombing these people
fucked up in Manchester this morning.

175
00:12:41,915 --> 00:12:44,434
<i>Let me translate this part
for you directly.</i>

176
00:12:47,356 --> 00:12:51,219
"We will avenge the America wars
on the Muslim world.

177
00:12:52,956 --> 00:12:55,192
We will come at them everywhere.

178
00:12:55,803 --> 00:13:00,538
<i>We will strike at random, across Europe,
then America, continually.</i>

179
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:02,486
We have bled.

180
00:13:02,652 --> 00:13:06,297
Now they will bleed. And bleed.

181
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,697
Until they are bled out. "

182
00:13:10,875 --> 00:13:12,283
Ed.

183
00:13:12,443 --> 00:13:14,932
It's 6:00 in the morning.

184
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,758
Saving civilization, honey.

185
00:13:16,923 --> 00:13:18,647
<i>Disks are passed from hand to hand.</i>

186
00:13:18,811 --> 00:13:21,267
The communiqu�s are not transmitted,
not copied.

187
00:13:21,436 --> 00:13:24,753
My man says that real orders
are verbal or in code on paper.

188
00:13:24,923 --> 00:13:26,962
Is there any indication of where he is?

189
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:30,447
No, sir.
He definitely does not have his location.

190
00:13:30,908 --> 00:13:33,842
But he did mention there's a safe house
up north, near Balad...

191
00:13:34,011 --> 00:13:35,538
<i>...where Al-Saleem may have been.</i>

192
00:13:35,709 --> 00:13:37,269
Dad?

193
00:13:37,436 --> 00:13:38,711
Hey.

194
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,724
They're killing anyone who knows anything.
He's scared.

195
00:13:41,884 --> 00:13:44,250
<i>We need to debrief him very carefully.</i>

196
00:13:44,411 --> 00:13:46,778
<i>- All right, so do it.
- In the States.</i>

197
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,216
No. Ahem.

198
00:13:48,379 --> 00:13:50,802
They're onto him.
That's the reason he's running.

199
00:13:50,971 --> 00:13:53,207
<i>- On the toilet, not the floor.
- You hear me, right?</i>

200
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,760
So he wants to come to America
in one piece...

201
00:13:55,931 --> 00:13:58,037
...instead of going to paradise
in a thousand.

202
00:13:58,203 --> 00:13:59,926
He should've thought of that before.

203
00:14:00,091 --> 00:14:03,475
I'm telling you.
They will kill him within a few days, Ed.

204
00:14:03,644 --> 00:14:06,100
Yep. And if they do, that's all right...

205
00:14:06,268 --> 00:14:08,724
...because we can be there
to see who pulls the trigger.

206
00:14:08,892 --> 00:14:11,096
Now, get back to bed. Good night.

207
00:14:11,259 --> 00:14:14,772
- Am I missing the point?
- I just offered him asylum.

208
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,533
<i>Well, you lied, buddy.</i>

209
00:14:17,307 --> 00:14:20,405
So just cut him loose...

210
00:14:20,572 --> 00:14:22,775
<i>...and put him back on the street.</i>

211
00:14:23,452 --> 00:14:24,434
All right.

212
00:14:32,443 --> 00:14:35,159
Okay, so everything's fine.
No, no, no problem. No problem.

213
00:14:35,323 --> 00:14:39,253
We just have to ask you a few more
questions, and then we can go.

214
00:14:39,421 --> 00:14:41,591
No, no more questions.
Take me to the Green Zone.

215
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,951
Maybe we could help. We have
a few questions. Everything will be fine.

216
00:14:45,115 --> 00:14:48,018
Trust me. Okay? It's okay. Sit down.

217
00:14:49,884 --> 00:14:52,272
You're a liar. You're a liar. You fucking d...

218
00:14:52,443 --> 00:14:54,996
Get on the fucking... Back the fuck up!
Step back!

219
00:14:55,163 --> 00:14:57,979
I talk to you! I talk to you!
And that's all you want!

220
00:14:58,139 --> 00:15:01,489
- You want to see who kills me, huh?
- Bassam. Search him. Get his phone.

221
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,494
Now you've seen our faces.
You know what that means.

222
00:15:05,659 --> 00:15:06,640
Computer.

223
00:15:06,812 --> 00:15:09,145
Guantanamo?
You threaten me with Guantanamo?

224
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:11,195
If you don't do exactly what I say...

225
00:15:11,356 --> 00:15:13,658
...I will execute you right here.
Do you understand?

226
00:15:14,652 --> 00:15:18,427
Listen, we are your friends, okay?
We're your friends.

227
00:15:18,586 --> 00:15:21,009
We're here to watch you.
We're here to protect you.

228
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:23,254
You can't even protect yourselves.

229
00:15:33,596 --> 00:15:35,635
<i>Boss?
Yeah, I'm right here.</i>

230
00:15:35,803 --> 00:15:37,397
<i>I got a visual on him.</i>

231
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:39,538
<i>Okay, where's he coming from?</i>

232
00:15:39,707 --> 00:15:41,682
He's riding up right now.
Coming right to us.

233
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,793
<i>Yes. I see him. I see him.</i>

234
00:15:43,962 --> 00:15:46,865
He's coming down the street.
He's coming north towards the square.

235
00:15:47,036 --> 00:15:50,200
<i>- I'm gonna hang back.
- All right, I'll let you know what he's doing.</i>

236
00:15:50,363 --> 00:15:53,177
Keep an eye on him for me.
He stopped in front of the caf�.

237
00:15:53,340 --> 00:15:54,965
He's walking right up.

238
00:15:56,764 --> 00:15:58,706
<i>- Listen, Bassam?
- Yeah?</i>

239
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:04,658
There is a black van heading this way
with some pretty dangerous-looking guys.

240
00:16:04,827 --> 00:16:08,243
<i>- They're staring right at him.
Yeah, I see it.</i>

241
00:16:08,412 --> 00:16:10,681
<i>Tell me what it does.
All right.</i>

242
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:14,586
Looks like it's parking right up ahead.
Yeah, it stopped. The van stopped.

243
00:16:14,746 --> 00:16:15,892
<i>Can I turn around?</i>

244
00:16:16,059 --> 00:16:18,164
Yeah, yeah, Nizar's getting on his bike.

245
00:16:18,331 --> 00:16:20,884
<i>There's like four or five guys
getting out of that van.</i>

246
00:16:21,052 --> 00:16:24,368
<i>Can you identify any of these guys?
- I've never seen these guys before.</i>

247
00:16:24,538 --> 00:16:25,522
We gotta move.

248
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:45,361
Did you see a flash?
What?

249
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:47,096
Did somebody get hit?

250
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:49,812
Let's see a playback on that.
Stay with him.

251
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:54,710
Hello.
- In case you didn't see it, I executed him.

252
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,086
<i>You did what you had to do.</i>

253
00:16:56,251 --> 00:17:00,245
If you hadn't, he would be describing you
down to your eyebrows to them right now.

254
00:17:00,412 --> 00:17:02,615
I did it, all right? It's done. I killed him.

255
00:17:02,778 --> 00:17:05,113
<i>He was always gonna get killed
no matter what he did.</i>

256
00:17:05,276 --> 00:17:07,609
Besides, you'd milked him and he was dry.

257
00:17:07,771 --> 00:17:09,461
Excuse me.

258
00:17:10,395 --> 00:17:11,705
<i>Ferris?</i>

259
00:17:11,867 --> 00:17:13,690
Is your silence supposed
to say something?

260
00:17:13,851 --> 00:17:16,022
Because you do know we're at war, right?

261
00:17:16,188 --> 00:17:19,984
Your friend, who you must have had some
intense cross-cultural eye contact with...

262
00:17:20,155 --> 00:17:23,002
...was a terrorist a-hole,
who turned out to be a coward...

263
00:17:23,163 --> 00:17:24,757
...who wanted to go to Disneyland.

264
00:17:24,923 --> 00:17:28,086
Listen, Ed, we're going north now,
do you hear me?

265
00:17:28,251 --> 00:17:31,895
<i>- We're going north to the Balad safe house.
- No, no, no, buddy. No, you're not.</i>

266
00:17:32,058 --> 00:17:33,685
You're blown. There's chatter.

267
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:36,852
Well, if I'm blown, Ed, that means
you should've sent a team here...

268
00:17:37,019 --> 00:17:40,914
...the minute Nizar got shot,
but you didn't send a team, did you?

269
00:17:41,084 --> 00:17:43,189
Well, not since we've been talking, Ferris.

270
00:17:43,355 --> 00:17:46,289
You and I, we're going to that safe house,
you understand? Now.

271
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,151
<i>- Ferris?
- Where's the goddamn car, huh?</i>

272
00:17:48,316 --> 00:17:49,298
Let's get out of here.

273
00:18:18,459 --> 00:18:21,426
It's time to move.
I'm coming back to you, all right?

274
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:26,164
If something happens,
you'll shoot me, right?

275
00:18:26,332 --> 00:18:28,568
- Yep.
- Good.

276
00:19:12,155 --> 00:19:13,585
Got you.

277
00:19:13,756 --> 00:19:15,250
Don't you fucking do it.

278
00:19:16,858 --> 00:19:18,321
Hassan! Hassan!

279
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:32,401
Urgent request you dispatch Chili, Speck
or Nitrate to these coordinates.

280
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,994
North, 34 degrees, 20 minutes,
16.8 seconds.

281
00:19:44,154 --> 00:19:47,351
<i>East, 44 degrees, 24 minutes,
14.4 seconds.</i>

282
00:19:47,516 --> 00:19:51,094
This is a live target, a known
operational base of an Al-Saleem cell.

283
00:19:51,259 --> 00:19:53,714
- A high-value target.
Copy that, on approach.

284
00:20:15,931 --> 00:20:18,036
Aah! Get back!

285
00:20:28,092 --> 00:20:29,913
Come on!

286
00:20:30,076 --> 00:20:32,890
- Gotta go! Gotta go!
I'm getting the intel!

287
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:38,513
Get in the fucking car, man!
Come on! Come on!

288
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,460
Go! Go!

289
00:20:54,427 --> 00:20:57,209
I've got guys coming down
the hill! Two trucks! On the right!

290
00:20:57,371 --> 00:20:58,897
I got it.

291
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,690
Keep moving!

292
00:21:24,892 --> 00:21:25,874
Fuck.

293
00:21:26,042 --> 00:21:28,662
We're in some serious
fucking trouble here.

294
00:21:28,826 --> 00:21:32,276
We're on Highway 1, south of Samarra.
We're being pursued by two vehicles.

295
00:21:32,442 --> 00:21:35,028
<i>We have valuable intel in our possession!</i>

296
00:21:35,195 --> 00:21:37,913
We're in a black Nissan.
Where the fuck are you people?

297
00:21:38,076 --> 00:21:40,464
<i>- I see them!
We're right on their six.</i>

298
00:21:43,163 --> 00:21:45,749
<i>- Have visual, will engage.
Copy that. Engage at will.</i>

299
00:21:58,172 --> 00:22:00,114
RPG. Take them out now.

300
00:22:05,883 --> 00:22:07,289
<i>Fire!</i>

301
00:22:07,450 --> 00:22:08,857
RPG!

302
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,972
<i>Nine, one, two, six, one.</i>

303
00:22:20,859 --> 00:22:22,550
Let's go!

304
00:22:24,251 --> 00:22:26,869
- Fuel tank is ruptured!
I got him! Get the driver out!

305
00:22:27,036 --> 00:22:30,002
I can't! He's in pieces!
Then get the bag! Get the intel!

306
00:22:31,036 --> 00:22:32,410
Bassam! Bassam!

307
00:22:33,051 --> 00:22:35,897
Stay with them. We are tracking.

308
00:22:37,243 --> 00:22:39,032
- Bassam!
Get his legs!

309
00:22:39,835 --> 00:22:42,769
No!
Intel secure!

310
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,631
Let's go! Stay down.

311
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:46,773
Come on, buddy.

312
00:22:47,323 --> 00:22:49,211
Come on. Get him out, now!

313
00:23:03,804 --> 00:23:05,492
<i>He's dead.</i>

314
00:23:09,691 --> 00:23:11,032
Who are you?

315
00:23:11,195 --> 00:23:12,276
What's your name?

316
00:23:12,443 --> 00:23:15,258
Do you know where you are? Come on!

317
00:23:16,058 --> 00:23:17,586
Fuck.

318
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:32,881
What's that?

319
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:34,512
Bone fragments.

320
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:36,532
Not yours.

321
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:46,192
- They get that stuff I sent out?
- All uploaded to Langley.

322
00:23:46,363 --> 00:23:48,021
Mr. Hoffman.

323
00:23:50,044 --> 00:23:52,345
<i>- Hey, Ed.
Ferris.</i>

324
00:23:52,508 --> 00:23:56,336
<i>- Christmas came early, buddy.
- Oh, yeah? What'd I get for Christmas, Ed?</i>

325
00:23:56,508 --> 00:24:00,281
Well, 15 pages of this, 40 pages of that.

326
00:24:00,442 --> 00:24:04,752
I got, like, about 712 phone numbers
that are new to us...

327
00:24:04,923 --> 00:24:06,679
...that we can strip and evaluate...

328
00:24:06,842 --> 00:24:09,810
...and amongst other things,
a safe house in Amman.

329
00:24:09,979 --> 00:24:12,345
I've got jihadists coming and going
from this place...

330
00:24:12,507 --> 00:24:14,394
...like it's happy hour at the Cat House.

331
00:24:15,003 --> 00:24:16,115
You gotta see this place.

332
00:24:16,731 --> 00:24:20,758
Before we get into that, I wanna know
what you're doing for Bassam's family, Ed.

333
00:24:20,923 --> 00:24:22,353
I didn't know the man.

334
00:24:22,523 --> 00:24:24,979
What are you doing for Bassam's family?
He was your guy.

335
00:24:25,146 --> 00:24:26,608
<i>So now you don't know him, huh?</i>

336
00:24:27,932 --> 00:24:31,412
<i>You'll be going to Amman
as acting station chief.</i>

337
00:24:31,579 --> 00:24:34,710
You'll outrank Holiday. No matter
what he says, you're the show-runner.

338
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:38,934
<i>You'll liaise with Jordanian GID,
who are as hot for Al-Saleem as we are.</i>

339
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:41,270
You'll be working with
a guy named Hani Salaam...

340
00:24:41,435 --> 00:24:43,856
...who is not your run-of-the-mill
fingernail-puller.

341
00:24:44,026 --> 00:24:45,368
Hani is a professional.

342
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:47,440
And will I be sharing information
with him?

343
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:50,359
<i>Let me say this about that: No.</i>

344
00:24:51,098 --> 00:24:54,098
Now, you wanna take a few weeks off
and go bang the wife?

345
00:24:54,267 --> 00:24:57,813
I'm getting a divorce, Ed. You know that.
You know more about it than I do.

346
00:24:57,979 --> 00:25:00,913
<i>Everybody around here screws up
their marriage, buddy. Why not you?</i>

347
00:25:01,946 --> 00:25:03,092
So you'll go to Amman?

348
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:09,266
I will go to Amman. I'll call you later.

349
00:25:47,324 --> 00:25:51,098
This car is a real pile of shit.
Is this the best they could afford?

350
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:54,674
I brought this car in case you wanted
to cruise the safe house now, you know?

351
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:58,105
No one cruises that safe house, all right?

352
00:25:58,267 --> 00:26:01,300
I need to take a shit, I need a shower
and an Internet connection...

353
00:26:01,468 --> 00:26:04,053
...so just take me to my apartment,
all right?

354
00:26:04,954 --> 00:26:07,289
Got you in a high-rise.

355
00:26:07,451 --> 00:26:10,134
Hot and cold water. And you can drink it.

356
00:26:10,298 --> 00:26:11,958
- Great.
- There's not much local color.

357
00:26:12,507 --> 00:26:14,776
I've had it with the local color.
Thank you.

358
00:26:30,234 --> 00:26:32,307
Cheap-ass motherfuckers.

359
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,256
Morning, sir.

360
00:26:39,898 --> 00:26:40,947
He's clear.

361
00:26:43,451 --> 00:26:45,752
NSA is listening to the phones
and computer links...

362
00:26:45,913 --> 00:26:47,671
...of anyone who's been near the house.

363
00:26:47,835 --> 00:26:51,447
Look, they don't have to be geniuses
to stop using their e-mail and cell phones.

364
00:26:51,611 --> 00:26:53,781
I don't understand why
you haven't figured out...

365
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:56,663
...that they're not communicating
electronically anymore.

366
00:26:57,818 --> 00:27:00,121
The house is owned
by a family named Alousi.

367
00:27:00,284 --> 00:27:03,480
And in my opinion, it just seems
like a normal Jordanian family...

368
00:27:03,643 --> 00:27:05,269
...with a lot of country relatives.

369
00:27:05,435 --> 00:27:06,744
Normal Jordanian family.

370
00:27:06,907 --> 00:27:12,656
But all of them are unmarried males
between the ages of 18 and 35, correct?

371
00:27:12,826 --> 00:27:15,127
Listen, kid,
whatever information you got in Iraq...

372
00:27:15,291 --> 00:27:18,224
...I just don't think this house
is what you think it is.

373
00:27:18,394 --> 00:27:22,192
These boys drink alcohol, they chase girls,
they smoke hash, and...

374
00:27:22,364 --> 00:27:23,770
So did Mohamed Atta, right?

375
00:27:23,931 --> 00:27:26,201
- It's Takfir methodology.
- Takfir methodology.

376
00:27:26,778 --> 00:27:30,008
Correct. It's permitted in order
to deceive the infidel.

377
00:27:30,459 --> 00:27:33,557
You've had guys watching them
go in and out of this safe house here...

378
00:27:33,723 --> 00:27:34,868
...but what I don't get...

379
00:27:35,035 --> 00:27:37,718
...is why you haven't had anyone
monitoring them after.

380
00:27:37,883 --> 00:27:40,304
Well, there's so much activity
at this location...

381
00:27:40,474 --> 00:27:43,791
...that we have exhausted the station's
indigenous-appearing manpower.

382
00:27:43,962 --> 00:27:47,061
So you don't have enough good Arab guys
to follow the bad Arab guys...

383
00:27:47,228 --> 00:27:49,016
...is what you're saying.
- That's right.

384
00:27:49,179 --> 00:27:51,765
Well, you're gonna need
some more human surveillance...

385
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:54,002
...loaners from Jordanian Intelligence.

386
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:55,604
All right. Skip, get out.

387
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:05,492
Now, I am in receipt of a directive...

388
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:10,067
...which tells me that I am
to make myself useful to you...

389
00:28:10,234 --> 00:28:14,009
...in whichever way
that you request or require.

390
00:28:14,171 --> 00:28:17,968
But it is my feeling that to involve
the Jordanian secret service...

391
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,310
...is a breach of operational integrity.

392
00:28:20,476 --> 00:28:23,606
You don't need to tell me
about Jordanian Intelligence, all right?

393
00:28:23,770 --> 00:28:26,705
They are doing a far superior job
than you are, my friend.

394
00:28:26,875 --> 00:28:28,435
You've read that directive there...

395
00:28:28,604 --> 00:28:31,353
...which clearly states that I am in charge
of this operation.

396
00:28:31,515 --> 00:28:34,384
So, what I need you to do
is leave this office immediately...

397
00:28:34,555 --> 00:28:36,410
...and hand your entire staff over to me.

398
00:28:39,163 --> 00:28:43,190
You know, we've all watched your rise
in the Near East Division.

399
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:45,519
I'll see you on the way down.

400
00:28:46,618 --> 00:28:48,375
You and Hoffman both.

401
00:28:58,875 --> 00:29:01,942
I need you to help me out
and get me a fresh pot of coffee, please...

402
00:29:02,107 --> 00:29:05,041
...and a full staff meeting
within the next 15 minutes, all right?

403
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:07,098
To be fair to Mr. Holiday, Mr. Ferris...

404
00:29:07,259 --> 00:29:09,845
...Mr. Hoffman never told us
this would be such a big deal.

405
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:12,248
Ed Hoffman is the head
of the Near East Division.

406
00:29:12,411 --> 00:29:16,470
But he does not know shit until he steals it
from the guy on the ground, and that's me.

407
00:29:16,634 --> 00:29:19,056
Now, please stop acting
like such a fucking ing�nue...

408
00:29:19,228 --> 00:29:22,772
...and try to get me a meeting
with Hani Salaam. Thanks.

409
00:29:38,394 --> 00:29:40,217
Mr. Ferris.

410
00:29:53,722 --> 00:29:55,000
Hani Pasha.

411
00:29:55,163 --> 00:29:57,497
Pasha? That is an Ottoman term.

412
00:29:57,657 --> 00:30:00,757
Well, I hear you like it, sir.
Pleasure to meet you.

413
00:30:01,276 --> 00:30:04,439
- Mr. Ferris, please take a seat.
- Thank you, sir.

414
00:30:07,098 --> 00:30:10,394
- Welcome to our promising country.
- Thank you so much.

415
00:30:10,555 --> 00:30:14,930
As reliable as your Ed Hoffman would call
a "towelhead monarchy" can be.

416
00:30:15,098 --> 00:30:17,881
Well, we'll leave that to Ed Hoffman, sir.

417
00:30:18,556 --> 00:30:19,962
Mm.

418
00:30:22,682 --> 00:30:24,691
What have you heard about this building?

419
00:30:24,858 --> 00:30:29,169
Well, to be quite honest,
I hear they call it the fingernail factory.

420
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:32,313
But no one close to you would say that,
of course.

421
00:30:32,474 --> 00:30:33,882
No.

422
00:30:34,363 --> 00:30:36,729
But people are stupid.

423
00:30:37,625 --> 00:30:41,040
Torture doesn't work.

424
00:30:41,626 --> 00:30:45,750
Under torture, a man will say
almost anything to make the pain stop.

425
00:30:47,355 --> 00:30:49,394
You have experience with this, I am sure.

426
00:30:52,346 --> 00:30:53,808
Mr. Ferris, here in Jordan...

427
00:30:53,979 --> 00:30:57,273
...to the fundamentalists, you see,
I am, myself, the enemy.

428
00:30:58,011 --> 00:30:59,953
Perhaps the worst kind.

429
00:31:00,987 --> 00:31:05,109
Take not the Jews and Christians as allies.
Do you know it, Mr. Ferris?

430
00:31:11,451 --> 00:31:13,752
The dar-al-Harb. Very good.

431
00:31:13,913 --> 00:31:17,527
We are together, Hani Pasha,
in this House of War, yes.

432
00:31:17,691 --> 00:31:20,558
You are smarter than the Americans
who are usually sent to Amman.

433
00:31:20,730 --> 00:31:24,179
- Thank you, sir.
- I knew this, of course, before you came.

434
00:31:24,666 --> 00:31:27,928
You are young,
but you respect your elders.

435
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,393
- You speak Arabic...
- Mm.

436
00:31:30,586 --> 00:31:33,140
...so you are a secret Arab.
- Mm.

437
00:31:40,891 --> 00:31:42,036
Now, ahem...

438
00:31:42,202 --> 00:31:44,920
We've recently discovered
a large Al-Saleem safe house...

439
00:31:45,082 --> 00:31:47,155
...and training cell here in Amman.

440
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:49,330
I would need your help
with surveillance, sir.

441
00:31:50,778 --> 00:31:53,560
Now, this is what we know so far.

442
00:31:54,651 --> 00:31:55,634
HANl:
This is unusual.

443
00:31:57,146 --> 00:32:00,246
Your Ed Hoffman would rather have less
information than share with me.

444
00:32:01,114 --> 00:32:04,311
Well, this is not Ed Hoffman.
This is not my predecessor.

445
00:32:04,474 --> 00:32:07,192
This is me, sir. Please, have a look.

446
00:32:19,098 --> 00:32:20,855
HANl:
I have one rule...

447
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:23,507
...if we are to cooperate, my dear.

448
00:32:24,474 --> 00:32:25,848
Never lie to me.

449
00:32:27,931 --> 00:32:29,686
Understand?

450
00:32:29,851 --> 00:32:31,574
Never lie to me.

451
00:32:35,962 --> 00:32:37,719
You shall have your agents.

452
00:32:37,883 --> 00:32:39,605
Thank you, sir.

453
00:32:40,538 --> 00:32:42,960
Agent Ferris is arriving at the site now.

454
00:32:43,131 --> 00:32:44,505
Thank you.

455
00:32:44,666 --> 00:32:47,568
Tracking now.
Roger that, I'll reposition the aircraft.

456
00:32:47,739 --> 00:32:49,079
Slewing to 2.5.

457
00:32:58,394 --> 00:33:02,191
There it is. That's it.
That's the safe house.

458
00:33:07,482 --> 00:33:08,890
Come on.

459
00:33:14,651 --> 00:33:16,821
- What do you wanna do with this guy?
Just watch.

460
00:33:16,987 --> 00:33:19,571
Watch him and what else?
Nothing else.

461
00:33:20,826 --> 00:33:22,998
I'm not sure about this GID surveillance.

462
00:33:23,643 --> 00:33:26,807
- I can't see any of Hani's guys.
- Well, I've spotted a few so far.

463
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:30,319
You see the two by the doorway there
in front of the safe house?

464
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:31,897
There's one more selling radios.

465
00:33:32,057 --> 00:33:34,676
And there's one behind me
with a striped shirt.

466
00:33:34,842 --> 00:33:36,271
That's what I've clocked so far.

467
00:33:39,067 --> 00:33:41,555
Who's this? Who just sat down?

468
00:33:41,722 --> 00:33:43,249
That's one of our guys.

469
00:33:43,419 --> 00:33:46,484
- One of your guys? What do you...?
- A station asset.

470
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:47,796
Zayed Ibishi.

471
00:33:48,219 --> 00:33:50,836
He's one of our contacts
from the Palestinian camps.

472
00:33:51,002 --> 00:33:52,661
Station asset, huh?

473
00:33:52,826 --> 00:33:55,162
What the fuck is he doing
making contact right now?

474
00:33:55,322 --> 00:33:58,638
- And how come I don't know about this?
- I don't know. I don't know.

475
00:33:59,162 --> 00:34:03,089
If he makes that jihadist suspicious,
they will shut down that house and leave.

476
00:34:03,259 --> 00:34:06,554
- He's gonna get that guy killed.
- He's gonna blow this whole operation.

477
00:34:07,386 --> 00:34:09,012
Not again. Fucking Hoffman!

478
00:34:15,514 --> 00:34:17,751
- Oops.
Continue tracking.

479
00:34:17,914 --> 00:34:19,027
Area expanded.

480
00:34:19,195 --> 00:34:20,568
Tracking.

481
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:33,585
Head him off! Head him off!

482
00:34:36,603 --> 00:34:38,641
Going down the alley.
Adjusting coverage.

483
00:34:38,811 --> 00:34:39,793
Boost image factor.

484
00:34:45,722 --> 00:34:47,632
Switching to SAR.
Stay with sweep.

485
00:34:51,034 --> 00:34:53,041
Hold image?
Lmage locked.

486
00:34:55,322 --> 00:34:56,402
Ah!

487
00:35:19,641 --> 00:35:22,260
Skip. I got him.

488
00:35:22,425 --> 00:35:24,760
I need you to come pick me up, all right?

489
00:35:24,922 --> 00:35:28,784
I got bit by fucking diseased dogs,
goddamn it.

490
00:35:28,954 --> 00:35:30,842
I'm by the clearing.

491
00:35:31,001 --> 00:35:33,108
Yeah, just look out for me.

492
00:35:41,434 --> 00:35:44,282
You gotta be kidding me.
Come on, take me to a real hospital.

493
00:35:44,443 --> 00:35:46,547
- Take me to the embassy.
- That's like an hour.

494
00:35:46,715 --> 00:35:50,610
Rabies around here is no joke. You're gonna
need a jab in there, ASAP. Let's go.

495
00:35:50,778 --> 00:35:52,208
Let's go.

496
00:35:57,338 --> 00:36:00,239
Let's get you vaccinated. Aisha.

497
00:36:15,929 --> 00:36:16,911
AISHA

498
00:36:19,195 --> 00:36:20,568
Let me see.

499
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:25,204
These are not bite wounds.

500
00:36:25,818 --> 00:36:28,469
- A snowboarding accident.
- Snowboarding.

501
00:36:28,635 --> 00:36:31,983
- Mm.
- You're accident prone, huh?

502
00:36:32,153 --> 00:36:35,929
Well, I mean,
I'm sure it looks that way. Yeah.

503
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,913
Okay.

504
00:36:44,250 --> 00:36:45,942
Relax.

505
00:36:47,067 --> 00:36:50,034
All right. Let me...

506
00:36:55,289 --> 00:36:58,192
My father was Iranian.

507
00:36:59,291 --> 00:37:01,494
I live in Amman now.

508
00:37:04,987 --> 00:37:06,840
Okay.

509
00:37:07,673 --> 00:37:09,561
This is going to hurt.

510
00:37:09,849 --> 00:37:11,704
Mm. I don't like needles.

511
00:37:11,865 --> 00:37:14,068
Just think about something else, hm?

512
00:37:17,786 --> 00:37:18,768
Okay.

513
00:37:20,378 --> 00:37:24,753
This is the first of five anti-rabies injections
you'll need over the next month.

514
00:37:24,922 --> 00:37:26,384
You don't need to come back here.

515
00:37:26,554 --> 00:37:30,547
You can get them at any clinic.
One each week, right?

516
00:37:31,065 --> 00:37:33,521
- So we're done?
- Yeah, we're done.

517
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:36,373
And someone will come
to bandage your wounds.

518
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,315
Thank you.

519
00:37:39,577 --> 00:37:42,579
<i>You fucking cocksucker. How did
you expect me to run an operation...</i>

520
00:37:42,746 --> 00:37:45,713
<i>...when you're running a side operation
which fucks up my own?</i>

521
00:37:45,882 --> 00:37:49,112
Listen, you want me to run Amman,
let me run Amman, all right?

522
00:37:49,275 --> 00:37:52,175
I have made promises to Hani Salaam.
Do you understand that?

523
00:37:52,347 --> 00:37:53,775
Uh-huh. What's your point?

524
00:37:53,947 --> 00:37:57,394
<i>My point is, Ed, you can't pull
your normal bullshit here, all right?</i>

525
00:37:57,563 --> 00:38:01,425
- We have to respect what he wants.
- I do respect him. What kind of thing?

526
00:38:01,594 --> 00:38:06,068
Look, you keep fucking around like this, and
you are gonna blow this Amman operation.

527
00:38:06,233 --> 00:38:08,536
- I love you. Bye.
- I love you too.

528
00:38:08,699 --> 00:38:12,114
They'll vacate their only known safe house,
and we'll never hear from them.

529
00:38:12,282 --> 00:38:14,585
- Do you understand?
- I'm just trying to back you up.

530
00:38:14,746 --> 00:38:16,721
It's a dangerous,
dangerous world out there.

531
00:38:16,889 --> 00:38:19,672
Well, don't back me up,
because I don't need it, all right?

532
00:38:20,186 --> 00:38:23,001
- Hani.
- I gotta go deal with this Hani bullshit.

533
00:38:23,161 --> 00:38:26,391
- So go fuck yourself.
- All right, whatever.

534
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:29,527
You ready to go?

535
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:31,512
Whatever.

536
00:38:47,835 --> 00:38:50,617
Hani Pasha, if you would give me
an opportunity to ex...

537
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:54,003
Fortunately the safe house is still there.

538
00:38:55,835 --> 00:38:58,737
As for the man you killed,
you were right.

539
00:38:58,907 --> 00:39:00,630
You made a good decision.

540
00:39:01,179 --> 00:39:04,822
The jihadists believe it was a robbery.
There are many robberies in that district.

541
00:39:04,987 --> 00:39:07,539
So you have been very clever, my dear.

542
00:39:07,706 --> 00:39:09,976
Well, that's good news, sir.

543
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,599
Listen, Ed Hoffman had...

544
00:39:11,769 --> 00:39:14,769
I have spoken to Mr. Hoffman
very sharply.

545
00:39:14,938 --> 00:39:17,688
Now, we will explain
the king's espionage laws to his agent.

546
00:39:37,242 --> 00:39:40,503
I thought you didn't believe in torture,
Hani Pasha.

547
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:44,114
This is punishment, my dear.
It's a very different thing.

548
00:39:48,601 --> 00:39:50,423
Keep watching.

549
00:39:51,577 --> 00:39:53,552
Tell Edward what you have seen.

550
00:41:06,873 --> 00:41:09,262
<i>Another deadly attack on innocent civilians.</i>

551
00:41:09,434 --> 00:41:13,210
<i>This time in one of Amsterdam's
most crowded tourist districts.</i>

552
00:41:13,371 --> 00:41:16,784
<i>The images of the bombing were captured
on location surveillance cameras.</i>

553
00:41:16,954 --> 00:41:18,994
<i>The blast felt for miles.</i>

554
00:41:19,163 --> 00:41:22,326
<i>What was once a block-long farmer market
vibrant with color...</i>

555
00:41:22,489 --> 00:41:24,050
<i>...is now in ruins and covered with ash.</i>

556
00:41:26,715 --> 00:41:28,503
<i>The exact number of casualties
is not yet known...</i>

557
00:41:28,666 --> 00:41:31,088
<i>...as emergency crews
are still pulling victims from the rubble.</i>

558
00:41:31,259 --> 00:41:35,086
<i>But officials are saying it will certainly be
in triple figures.</i>

559
00:41:35,577 --> 00:41:39,353
<i>KLPD antiterror-unit investigators
have arrived...</i>

560
00:41:39,514 --> 00:41:43,059
<i>...and are examining bomb fragments
in the hope of determining if this...</i>

561
00:41:43,226 --> 00:41:47,318
<i>...and the other recent bombings on the
continent and in the UK are connected.</i>

562
00:41:47,481 --> 00:41:51,672
<i>The consequence of a new bombing
will no doubt have a devastating effect...</i>

563
00:41:51,833 --> 00:41:54,038
<i>...on Europe's tourist business.</i>

564
00:41:54,202 --> 00:41:57,585
<i>Let's go now
to Amsterdam's chief of police.</i>

565
00:41:57,753 --> 00:42:02,324
<i>We will do whatever we can
to keep everyone safe...</i>

566
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:05,784
<i>...for you to live every day
without being afraid.</i>

567
00:42:05,945 --> 00:42:08,050
<i>But we must be realistic.</i>

568
00:42:08,217 --> 00:42:13,521
<i>Terrorist threats are real, present,
deadly and persistent.</i>

569
00:42:16,378 --> 00:42:18,713
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.

570
00:42:20,762 --> 00:42:21,744
Where are we going?

571
00:42:21,914 --> 00:42:23,737
We are going fishing.

572
00:42:23,898 --> 00:42:25,393
Get in.

573
00:42:32,409 --> 00:42:34,646
Since no credit was claimed
for the bombing...

574
00:42:34,811 --> 00:42:37,460
...we believe it to be the work
of Al-Saleem.

575
00:42:37,625 --> 00:42:39,992
That's his signature. Anonymity.

576
00:42:40,987 --> 00:42:43,289
So, what we need is... May I say we?

577
00:42:43,451 --> 00:42:46,766
Of course.
As long as we keep it between us.

578
00:42:47,418 --> 00:42:49,655
We need a man inside the Amman cell.

579
00:42:49,818 --> 00:42:51,226
We do. Yes.

580
00:42:51,387 --> 00:42:52,913
And we shall have the man we need.

581
00:42:53,081 --> 00:42:56,594
- How's that?
- Because you gave him to me.

582
00:42:58,170 --> 00:43:01,365
<i>His name is Mustafa Karami.
I've known him since he was a teenager...</i>

583
00:43:01,530 --> 00:43:04,278
<i>...selling boom boxes
from the back of a stolen truck.</i>

584
00:43:04,442 --> 00:43:07,027
<i>Now he's al Qaeda. In my country.</i>

585
00:43:08,315 --> 00:43:09,875
<i>Watch and learn, my dear.</i>

586
00:43:10,041 --> 00:43:11,251
Watch and learn.

587
00:43:45,818 --> 00:43:47,094
KARAMl:

588
00:43:48,505 --> 00:43:51,255
You did not think to tell Hani Salaam
you are a jihadist?

589
00:43:52,409 --> 00:43:55,541
You have become a religious man, hm?

590
00:43:55,706 --> 00:43:57,233
No longer a thief.

591
00:43:58,139 --> 00:43:59,829
Can it be true?

592
00:44:00,922 --> 00:44:02,032
Here.

593
00:44:03,833 --> 00:44:04,980
Take the phone.

594
00:44:05,146 --> 00:44:07,481
Take it and talk to your mother.

595
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:09,498
Talk.

596
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:14,514
<i>Hello? Hello?
- Hello.</i>

597
00:44:16,153 --> 00:44:19,351
HANl:
His mother was in the Palestinian camps.

598
00:44:19,514 --> 00:44:22,929
Now she has a fine apartment
and a beautiful garden.

599
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:26,295
She can watch the sun set over the hills.

600
00:44:26,458 --> 00:44:31,346
She has a refrigerator, couch,
even a television set.

601
00:44:31,514 --> 00:44:35,222
She will tell him she is proud of him, that
she always knew he would be a success...

602
00:44:35,385 --> 00:44:37,807
...even when he was a little boy
in the refugee camps.

603
00:44:37,978 --> 00:44:39,833
And now he has sent her money.

604
00:44:39,994 --> 00:44:42,067
She is glad he is no longer mixed up
with the radicals.

605
00:44:55,706 --> 00:44:58,672
You are God's blessing to your mother,
Mustafa.

606
00:44:59,353 --> 00:45:02,168
You have done none of these things for her.
But you should have.

607
00:45:02,969 --> 00:45:05,751
A mother is worth more
than anything they have told you.

608
00:45:05,914 --> 00:45:10,103
You know, you will be better in the future
because we have sent her many gifts...

609
00:45:10,266 --> 00:45:12,753
...and we have told her these gifts come
from her son.

610
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,423
HANl:

611
00:45:19,226 --> 00:45:21,648
Continue your life with your brothers
in al Qaeda.

612
00:45:21,817 --> 00:45:23,922
We will devise a way to talk. Come.

613
00:45:25,530 --> 00:45:28,528
Come. No, no, no. Come, come, come.

614
00:45:28,697 --> 00:45:31,284
Up, up, up.

615
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:35,414
Go.

616
00:45:41,594 --> 00:45:45,009
And so we throw him back into the sea,
to swim where he naturally swims...

617
00:45:45,177 --> 00:45:47,829
...to learn what he naturally learns...

618
00:45:47,994 --> 00:45:50,612
...and see how long he remembers
my benevolence.

619
00:45:52,027 --> 00:45:53,367
And what if he forgets?

620
00:45:54,489 --> 00:45:58,483
If he forgets, I remind him that I have
the power of life and death over him...

621
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:02,871
...because, you see, any time I wish,
I can let them know he works for me.

622
00:46:04,057 --> 00:46:05,302
Hm.

623
00:46:07,960 --> 00:46:09,041
<i>Ed?</i>

624
00:46:09,210 --> 00:46:10,998
<i>So tell me about Hani's guy.</i>

625
00:46:11,161 --> 00:46:12,985
<i>- Who?
- Karami, the guy on the bike.</i>

626
00:46:13,146 --> 00:46:15,481
<i>What do you think I do in my spare time,
play tennis?</i>

627
00:46:15,641 --> 00:46:18,675
<i>- I look like a tennis player to you?
- It's not gonna happen, Ed.</i>

628
00:46:18,842 --> 00:46:22,585
<i>Buddy, we're a results-oriented
organization, and we need results now...</i>

629
00:46:22,746 --> 00:46:24,568
<i>...because otherwise I will be unhappy.</i>

630
00:46:24,730 --> 00:46:26,900
<i>You'll be unhappy, and he'll say, "Insa. "</i>

631
00:46:27,065 --> 00:46:28,112
<i>What does that mean?</i>

632
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:30,038
Means "too fucking bad,"
is what it means.

633
00:46:30,202 --> 00:46:33,431
<i>Too fucking bad?
Europe is getting hammered, boy. All right?</i>

634
00:46:33,594 --> 00:46:35,601
<i>Nobody knows where the next bomb
is going off.</i>

635
00:46:35,769 --> 00:46:37,679
<i>There's 75 dead in Amsterdam.</i>

636
00:46:37,849 --> 00:46:40,184
<i>You can call me sentimental
if you want to, buddy...</i>

637
00:46:40,346 --> 00:46:42,003
Ed, listen, Hani does not trust you.

638
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:44,079
Arabs will only help you if they trust you.

639
00:46:44,248 --> 00:46:46,137
We need to earn that trust,
you understand?

640
00:46:46,297 --> 00:46:47,443
<i>What are you, moving here?</i>

641
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:51,635
<i>I don't care about cultural insecurity issues.
I don't care if Hani trusts me or not.</i>

642
00:46:51,802 --> 00:46:54,353
<i>What he will do is he will thank me
in the long run. Fuck.</i>

643
00:46:54,523 --> 00:46:56,431
<i>Hold on. Hold on.</i>

644
00:46:58,010 --> 00:46:59,733
Buddy, you're home.

645
00:47:01,081 --> 00:47:03,864
Jesus Christ, Ed,
you scared the shit out of me.

646
00:47:04,027 --> 00:47:06,677
They say that you should
never drink red wine in the desert.

647
00:47:06,842 --> 00:47:08,730
That's what did in the Babylonians, right?

648
00:47:08,889 --> 00:47:12,567
Well, a couple of bottles of that
and we'll be speaking Babylonian.

649
00:47:12,730 --> 00:47:15,478
So how was your flight?

650
00:47:15,641 --> 00:47:19,318
<i>Oh, it was fine. It was fine.
Yeah. I watched that Poseidon.</i>

651
00:47:20,634 --> 00:47:23,632
I see you've made yourself at home.

652
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:39,985
In the words of the great Sam Snead:

653
00:47:40,155 --> 00:47:44,083
"If you're not thinking about pussy,
you're just not concentrating. "

654
00:47:44,248 --> 00:47:45,362
My dear.

655
00:47:45,528 --> 00:47:47,253
Jesus Christ. Come on.

656
00:47:49,882 --> 00:47:51,376
Hani Pasha.

657
00:47:51,545 --> 00:47:52,920
Thank you for your time.

658
00:47:53,081 --> 00:47:54,293
Please.

659
00:47:54,907 --> 00:47:58,255
I'm gonna need a piece of this guy you got
here in this Amman cell.

660
00:47:58,425 --> 00:48:00,880
Don't look at buddy.
Buddy didn't say nothing.

661
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:04,760
These jihadists might not use their cell
phones, Hani, but you do use yours, right?

662
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:06,384
Please.

663
00:48:06,554 --> 00:48:09,369
Now, don't say no before I say anything.

664
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:12,050
Just let me say
what I've come here to say.

665
00:48:12,954 --> 00:48:17,972
Thank you. You have done an incredible job
developing this guy Karoobi.

666
00:48:18,842 --> 00:48:20,018
Katoomi.

667
00:48:20,186 --> 00:48:21,746
- Karami.
Karami.

668
00:48:21,914 --> 00:48:26,224
Now, we develop these assets
to use them as needed.

669
00:48:26,393 --> 00:48:27,570
And I have a need.

670
00:48:28,442 --> 00:48:30,197
No.

671
00:48:33,081 --> 00:48:36,431
- I'm just gonna get all frustrated here.
- Why are you frustrated, Edward?

672
00:48:36,601 --> 00:48:38,195
Because we have a partnership.

673
00:48:38,362 --> 00:48:40,597
You have something that I need
that will help me...

674
00:48:40,762 --> 00:48:42,322
...and you won't allow that to happen.

675
00:48:42,489 --> 00:48:45,523
And I'm trying to impress upon you
a sense of urgency.

676
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:50,000
Urgency does not call for changing methods
that work for methods that do not work.

677
00:48:50,842 --> 00:48:52,815
Now, who pays the bills around here?

678
00:48:52,985 --> 00:48:55,735
I would hate to have to have my president
call your king.

679
00:48:55,898 --> 00:48:58,353
Because that's just gonna
be embarrassing for all of us.

680
00:48:58,521 --> 00:49:02,132
In matters of intelligence, Edward,
you are speaking to the king.

681
00:49:02,297 --> 00:49:03,989
- Is that right?
- Mm.

682
00:49:04,762 --> 00:49:08,373
Well, Your Highness, I want control.

683
00:49:08,538 --> 00:49:12,083
- As a favor to the United States.
- You can't have it.

684
00:49:13,177 --> 00:49:17,072
I could tell you we will run him jointly,
but it would not be the truth.

685
00:49:17,242 --> 00:49:21,300
Real intelligence operations,
they remain secret forever.

686
00:49:22,266 --> 00:49:27,186
You Americans, you are incapable
of secrecy because you are a democracy.

687
00:49:27,353 --> 00:49:30,387
Now, I know my business.

688
00:49:30,554 --> 00:49:32,889
I have never failed you, have I?

689
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:38,101
No, you have not. Are you sure
you wanna make this the first time?

690
00:49:38,297 --> 00:49:41,014
HANl:
Edward, you're missing the point.

691
00:49:41,177 --> 00:49:42,965
Karami, he doesn't know anything.

692
00:49:43,130 --> 00:49:45,496
That is not the way
the organization operates.

693
00:49:45,657 --> 00:49:49,684
I will ask him what he knows
when it is time.

694
00:49:49,849 --> 00:49:53,079
- Now, are you happy?
- I'm getting there.

695
00:49:54,809 --> 00:49:57,012
Now, you guys
might have invented algebra...

696
00:49:57,177 --> 00:49:59,414
...but we're the guys
that found out how to use it.

697
00:49:59,577 --> 00:50:02,512
I presume you know who that is?

698
00:50:02,681 --> 00:50:04,503
It's a recent photograph of Al-Saleem.

699
00:50:04,666 --> 00:50:06,835
You didn't have that one, did you?

700
00:50:07,001 --> 00:50:09,652
Well, that's yours.
You can keep that because we're partners.

701
00:50:09,818 --> 00:50:13,527
All right? Now, I'm fulfilling my side
of the bargain, okay?

702
00:50:13,690 --> 00:50:16,985
Now's the time for some reciprocity.

703
00:50:18,458 --> 00:50:20,246
You need to give me Karami.

704
00:50:26,041 --> 00:50:27,023
<i>Insa.</i>

705
00:50:28,250 --> 00:50:32,855
- That's, "Too fucking bad. "
- I know what that means.

706
00:50:33,690 --> 00:50:35,795
Well, that was
fucking embarrassing, hm?

707
00:50:36,666 --> 00:50:38,574
You still thinking about pussy, Ed?

708
00:50:38,744 --> 00:50:42,836
Don't be a smart aleck.
Thing about that Hani, he's bright.

709
00:50:43,001 --> 00:50:45,302
But he's also arrogant.
That's gonna be his undoing.

710
00:50:45,465 --> 00:50:47,605
You're talking about him, right?

711
00:50:47,769 --> 00:50:48,914
Just flow with me, buddy.

712
00:50:49,081 --> 00:50:52,626
Jesus Christ. You have a recent photograph
of Al-Saleem.

713
00:50:52,793 --> 00:50:55,313
Don't you think I could've used intel
like that, Ed?

714
00:50:55,481 --> 00:50:57,849
What the hell else
are you holding back from me?

715
00:50:58,010 --> 00:50:59,023
What do you wanna know?

716
00:50:59,193 --> 00:51:01,081
Well, for one thing, what's his real name?

717
00:51:01,242 --> 00:51:03,795
Kareem Al-Shams.

718
00:51:04,538 --> 00:51:05,911
His birthplace?

719
00:51:06,072 --> 00:51:08,856
Syria. Hama.

720
00:51:09,913 --> 00:51:11,539
Background?

721
00:51:11,706 --> 00:51:15,929
Well, his loving middle-class family
got killed by Hafez Assad...

722
00:51:16,088 --> 00:51:18,293
<i>...so he moved to Saudi Arabia.</i>

723
00:51:18,458 --> 00:51:22,733
<i>Studied physics and engineering in Riyadh,
then here in Amman.</i>

724
00:51:22,905 --> 00:51:26,550
<i>Post-graduate study at the University of
North Carolina. He's a Tar Heel like you.</i>

725
00:51:26,713 --> 00:51:30,423
<i>Now, he prides himself on his humility
and not having to take the credit.</i>

726
00:51:30,585 --> 00:51:33,902
<i>Yet this is the same man who will go
on videotape with his brothers...</i>

727
00:51:34,074 --> 00:51:36,692
<i>...describing what he's done
and what's gonna come.</i>

728
00:51:36,858 --> 00:51:39,760
<i>His is a false humility.
It's a false modesty.</i>

729
00:51:39,929 --> 00:51:43,311
<i>His ego is more powerful than his beliefs,
more dangerous.</i>

730
00:51:43,481 --> 00:51:45,074
<i>And that is his weakness.</i>

731
00:51:45,242 --> 00:51:50,545
<i>Now, all we got to do, Ferris,
is just get that fucker on the phone.</i>

732
00:51:54,809 --> 00:51:55,791
Ed?

733
00:51:55,961 --> 00:51:57,523
Yeah.

734
00:51:57,688 --> 00:52:01,945
Don't do anything about Karami, huh?
Don't try to flip him or anything like that.

735
00:52:02,106 --> 00:52:04,177
Hani will throw me out.
I promise you that.

736
00:52:04,344 --> 00:52:06,003
This operation will be over.

737
00:52:07,065 --> 00:52:10,610
You cannot trust Hani. Am I clear?

738
00:52:11,449 --> 00:52:13,206
You're clear.

739
00:52:14,489 --> 00:52:17,556
Good. You and I gotta get drunk
because I need to sleep on the plane.

740
00:52:17,722 --> 00:52:20,983
<i>I have to take the kids
to The Lion King. Again.</i>

741
00:52:22,202 --> 00:52:23,411
Never have kids.

742
00:52:24,697 --> 00:52:28,047
- Ed, did you hear what I said, right?
- Oh, yeah.

743
00:52:28,217 --> 00:52:32,340
- Don't... Don't touch Karami.
- All right.

744
00:52:32,856 --> 00:52:34,679
Never.

745
00:52:50,425 --> 00:52:52,695
That's Karami. We're on. Get the van.

746
00:53:23,322 --> 00:53:25,394
Move the fucking van!

747
00:53:27,769 --> 00:53:30,039
Go! Go, go, go!

748
00:53:36,538 --> 00:53:37,519
Fuck!

749
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:52,083
I thought I told you
you could get this at any clinic.

750
00:53:52,250 --> 00:53:56,527
And you should have had
your injection yesterday.

751
00:53:56,697 --> 00:53:58,869
You weren't on duty yesterday.

752
00:53:59,034 --> 00:54:02,994
Besides, when you find a good doctor,
you don't change, right?

753
00:54:03,161 --> 00:54:04,306
I'm not a doctor.

754
00:54:08,505 --> 00:54:10,327
The same thing. You don't change.

755
00:54:11,641 --> 00:54:12,623
Wife.

756
00:54:12,793 --> 00:54:15,576
Well, I don't have a ring.

757
00:54:15,737 --> 00:54:18,159
No, but you did last week.

758
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,630
Ah. So you noticed?

759
00:54:21,945 --> 00:54:23,351
Bad husband.

760
00:54:24,057 --> 00:54:27,057
Ah! Yes. Ahem.
Yes, I was a bad husband.

761
00:54:27,224 --> 00:54:29,429
And she was an even worse wife...

762
00:54:29,594 --> 00:54:32,342
...which is why we're divorced now.

763
00:54:32,503 --> 00:54:33,487
It's over.

764
00:54:36,538 --> 00:54:38,960
And now you're looking
for something else, huh?

765
00:54:39,641 --> 00:54:42,543
Something as different from her
as you can find.

766
00:54:42,713 --> 00:54:46,226
Something close to impossible.

767
00:54:46,393 --> 00:54:47,954
We're done.

768
00:54:48,858 --> 00:54:50,286
Till next week.

769
00:54:57,945 --> 00:54:59,505
May I?

770
00:54:59,672 --> 00:55:01,778
Yes.

771
00:55:02,650 --> 00:55:05,039
I was wondering if maybe...

772
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:08,983
...you wanted to have a conversation
sooner than next week.

773
00:55:09,144 --> 00:55:12,375
<i>Maybe, inshallah, later this afternoon...</i>

774
00:55:12,538 --> 00:55:14,643
...if that wouldn't make you
uncomfortable.

775
00:55:15,708 --> 00:55:19,637
Well, for you and me
to be able to do that...

776
00:55:19,804 --> 00:55:22,139
...first we would have
to have a conversation...

777
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:24,952
...about the proper way
to have a conversation.

778
00:55:26,012 --> 00:55:27,922
Anyway, where I'm going
this afternoon...

779
00:55:28,092 --> 00:55:31,157
...would make you more uncomfortable
than me.

780
00:55:31,324 --> 00:55:34,193
Well, I doubt that.

781
00:55:34,364 --> 00:55:36,119
I don't.

782
00:56:04,923 --> 00:56:05,972
WOMAN

783
00:56:12,347 --> 00:56:15,927
If you're trying to figure out how far I'll go
in order to express my interest...

784
00:56:16,092 --> 00:56:18,425
...I think you have the answer.

785
00:56:19,228 --> 00:56:21,367
- Do I?
- Mm.

786
00:56:21,532 --> 00:56:24,666
What else are you supposed to do
at this point? Leave here alone?

787
00:56:25,213 --> 00:56:28,027
You're safer with me and you know it.

788
00:56:28,188 --> 00:56:30,077
What are you asking?

789
00:56:30,237 --> 00:56:32,603
I'm asking what you do here.

790
00:56:33,275 --> 00:56:34,902
Well, I'm a political adviser.

791
00:56:36,188 --> 00:56:37,715
Who snowboards in Amman.

792
00:56:37,884 --> 00:56:40,306
- That's right.
- Yeah, yeah.

793
00:56:40,476 --> 00:56:44,251
Listen, I have a thing to tell you,
an important one.

794
00:56:44,414 --> 00:56:47,608
A man is not his job.

795
00:56:47,773 --> 00:56:50,902
I mean, he's apart from his job. The man.

796
00:56:51,068 --> 00:56:52,824
I understand.

797
00:56:52,989 --> 00:56:55,858
No, I just want you
to know my feeling, my...

798
00:56:56,027 --> 00:56:58,746
My understanding of you.

799
00:56:58,909 --> 00:57:01,146
- Well, thank you.
- You're welcome.

800
00:57:10,172 --> 00:57:12,563
May I see you again, Aisha?

801
00:57:20,731 --> 00:57:23,001
When you wish
and with your permission, of course.

802
00:57:23,164 --> 00:57:26,581
Where did you learn to speak Arabic
like this?

803
00:57:27,452 --> 00:57:29,940
Yeah, yeah, we are friends.

804
00:57:30,108 --> 00:57:31,318
We may talk again.

805
00:57:32,284 --> 00:57:33,878
We may.

806
00:57:34,043 --> 00:57:36,215
Well, thank you.

807
00:57:51,166 --> 00:57:52,789
He's my friend.

808
00:57:54,653 --> 00:57:57,239
- It's fine. It's fine.
- You sure?

809
00:57:58,396 --> 00:57:59,672
It's fine.

810
00:58:01,277 --> 00:58:02,389
What's this all about?

811
00:59:29,021 --> 00:59:31,474
Marwan showed you the burning house?

812
00:59:32,347 --> 00:59:33,559
Do you know what happened?

813
00:59:33,724 --> 00:59:35,994
I have absolutely no idea.

814
00:59:37,117 --> 00:59:40,860
You see, you could have said
to me yes or no. Simply that.

815
00:59:41,019 --> 00:59:45,014
When a man says to me more
than yes or no, then I begin to wonder.

816
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:48,146
I don't know what happened, Hani.

817
00:59:50,525 --> 00:59:54,867
We had the advantage.
That house could have led us to Al-Saleem.

818
00:59:55,036 --> 00:59:57,492
Now it is gone.
Everything inside it is gone.

819
00:59:57,661 --> 00:59:59,318
Here. Kneel.
- Hani, listen to me, I...

820
00:59:59,485 --> 01:00:01,907
I told you never to lie to me.

821
01:00:02,077 --> 01:00:03,800
I am not lying to you, Hani.

822
01:00:03,963 --> 01:00:07,094
HANl: You did not know that this man,
after everything I said to you...

823
01:00:07,260 --> 01:00:10,293
...everything I said to Edward,
that he tried to take Karami?

824
01:00:11,485 --> 01:00:13,721
He did not know.

825
01:00:13,885 --> 01:00:16,023
When I want to speak with you,
I will look at you.

826
01:00:17,501 --> 01:00:18,907
Now I am talking to Mr. Ferris.

827
01:00:19,900 --> 01:00:22,617
So in as few words as possible...

828
01:00:23,228 --> 01:00:24,507
...did you know?

829
01:00:25,213 --> 01:00:26,903
No.

830
01:00:27,070 --> 01:00:29,010
I don't believe you.

831
01:00:29,757 --> 01:00:31,992
You have 12 hours to leave Jordan.

832
01:00:32,157 --> 01:00:35,320
If I find you here,
I will not be responsible for your safety.

833
01:00:35,483 --> 01:00:36,891
Do you understand me?

834
01:00:52,125 --> 01:00:54,710
Now, you knew you needed
to adapt to this environment.

835
01:00:54,876 --> 01:00:57,264
Ferris, I know, but, you know, I...

836
01:01:04,315 --> 01:01:05,460
Ferris!

837
01:01:11,485 --> 01:01:12,891
Ferris!

838
01:01:29,501 --> 01:01:32,849
Well, hey, buddy. Back from the sandbox?

839
01:01:33,021 --> 01:01:35,224
Enjoying civilization?
You wanna get a hot dog?

840
01:01:35,389 --> 01:01:38,617
How do you expect me to operate, Ed,
when you're keeping all the cards?

841
01:01:38,780 --> 01:01:41,496
- What about an ice cream?
- All Hani wanted was patience, Ed.

842
01:01:41,661 --> 01:01:44,213
- Patience. Not as a personal quality...
- I don't care.

843
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:47,893
Not as a personal quality, but an operational
requirement, and you can't do it?

844
01:01:48,061 --> 01:01:51,376
You're too power hungry and greedy.
You fucked this whole operation up!

845
01:01:51,548 --> 01:01:53,784
For chrissakes,
I thought Hani wanted to kill me!

846
01:01:53,947 --> 01:01:55,061
Oh, don't exaggerate.

847
01:01:55,228 --> 01:01:58,740
Hani don't want to kill you.
He likes you. He likes you a lot.

848
01:01:58,909 --> 01:02:02,902
And who is he gonna get over there
better for him than you? Nobody.

849
01:02:03,356 --> 01:02:06,257
Don't worry. You're gonna
be back in Jordan before you know it.

850
01:02:06,427 --> 01:02:08,500
Back with your Jordanian
piece of poontang...

851
01:02:08,668 --> 01:02:11,320
...that you think I don't know about,
but I do.

852
01:02:11,485 --> 01:02:14,068
You're a fat fucking piece of shit,
you know that, Ed?

853
01:02:14,235 --> 01:02:16,918
We do this shit for a living,
go on a diet, for chrissakes.

854
01:02:17,085 --> 01:02:21,240
Are you quite finished?
Now, I did what I had to do.

855
01:02:22,396 --> 01:02:24,882
<i>I ain't got time to play
Patience, Sidi, Patience...</i>

856
01:02:25,052 --> 01:02:27,224
...and sit around eating couscous.

857
01:02:29,693 --> 01:02:33,139
Hani's interests extend only
to his own little fiefdom.

858
01:02:33,307 --> 01:02:34,682
Mine are global.

859
01:02:36,284 --> 01:02:37,713
Now, having said that...

860
01:02:37,885 --> 01:02:42,969
...I admit that perhaps, possibly, I should
have, from an operational standpoint...

861
01:02:43,132 --> 01:02:45,237
...brought you into what I was doing.
- Exactly.

862
01:02:45,405 --> 01:02:48,632
What you should've done was listen
to what Hani said, and you know that.

863
01:02:52,061 --> 01:02:54,742
You know, 10 years ago,
I could've beat the crap out of you.

864
01:02:54,907 --> 01:02:57,079
Should've taken the shot
when you had the chance.

865
01:02:57,246 --> 01:02:59,349
Maybe I should've. Can't do it now.

866
01:03:00,414 --> 01:03:03,793
What we need to do,
with or without the cooperation of Hani...

867
01:03:03,965 --> 01:03:07,608
...is get our own man
inside Al-Saleem's tent.

868
01:03:08,827 --> 01:03:11,641
We could penetrate every goddamn
Salafi mosque in the world...

869
01:03:11,804 --> 01:03:13,943
...and still not even get close.

870
01:03:18,333 --> 01:03:20,786
- But Al-Saleem doesn't know that, right?
- What?

871
01:03:20,956 --> 01:03:24,786
He doesn't know that.
I mean, he doesn't know what we can't do.

872
01:03:24,958 --> 01:03:26,898
He doesn't know how close
or how far we are.

873
01:03:27,068 --> 01:03:28,891
He doesn't know what's true
or what isn't.

874
01:03:29,052 --> 01:03:32,762
I mean... Look, Osama fed Zarqawi
to the dogs...

875
01:03:32,923 --> 01:03:34,931
...because he was getting
too powerful, right?

876
01:03:35,099 --> 01:03:37,306
- Right.
- What if instead of tracking Al-Saleem...

877
01:03:37,467 --> 01:03:40,467
...like we're doing right now
with absolutely no results...

878
01:03:40,635 --> 01:03:44,280
...we make it appear that there
is another terrorist operation out there...

879
01:03:44,445 --> 01:03:46,070
...just as effective as his own?

880
01:03:46,235 --> 01:03:49,978
I mean, how would Al-Saleem react
to that kind of challenge to his stats?

881
01:03:50,139 --> 01:03:52,530
- What would he do?
- He would get paranoid.

882
01:03:52,699 --> 01:03:55,186
- He might rejoice. Maybe both.
- Exactly.

883
01:03:55,356 --> 01:03:58,009
But either way,
he'd try to get in contact with them, right?

884
01:03:58,172 --> 01:04:00,594
- Right.
- Which would be us.

885
01:04:01,563 --> 01:04:03,355
That would be us.

886
01:04:04,572 --> 01:04:07,474
You're a devious SOB.

887
01:04:07,643 --> 01:04:10,992
- We can't do this out of Langley.
- No. No, sir.

888
01:04:30,619 --> 01:04:33,556
Garland. Roger Ferris.
Pleased to meet you.

889
01:04:33,724 --> 01:04:35,065
Where's Hoffman?

890
01:04:35,226 --> 01:04:37,398
I don't know. Ben & Jerry's.

891
01:04:40,349 --> 01:04:42,291
He trusts you.

892
01:04:42,458 --> 01:04:47,130
I don't trust him. Every time we run
an operation and I don't see Hoffman...

893
01:04:47,291 --> 01:04:50,108
...it means he's running
another operation. Coffee?

894
01:04:50,268 --> 01:04:52,951
Yes, please. Black. Thank you.

895
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:57,300
- Fruit? Strawberries, plums, apples?
- No, thanks.

896
01:04:58,619 --> 01:05:01,619
We're tracking a cell in Syria.
Last night, they were in Damascus.

897
01:05:01,788 --> 01:05:05,748
Today, Dayr Az-Zawr and the Iraqi border.

898
01:05:05,916 --> 01:05:08,983
But something tells me
they won't make it to Hasbaya.

899
01:05:09,150 --> 01:05:13,489
We have ninjas waiting.

900
01:05:13,661 --> 01:05:16,313
Who do these ninjas work for?

901
01:05:16,476 --> 01:05:17,851
Me.

902
01:05:18,012 --> 01:05:19,670
Shall we?

903
01:05:27,068 --> 01:05:30,132
So where is everyone?

904
01:05:30,302 --> 01:05:32,155
Absolutely no idea what you mean.

905
01:05:32,315 --> 01:05:37,750
- What? You mean it's just you?
- No. It's me and you.

906
01:05:37,916 --> 01:05:40,731
Did you think there'd be some
war room with lights flashing...

907
01:05:40,893 --> 01:05:42,235
...and people with clipboards?

908
01:05:42,396 --> 01:05:45,364
No, it's all here and here and here.
And here.

909
01:05:45,532 --> 01:05:48,117
Sure you won't have a strawberry?
They're really delicious.

910
01:05:48,286 --> 01:05:50,554
Yeah, no, I'm positive.

911
01:05:50,715 --> 01:05:54,675
Look, I'm gonna need some really, really
low-level al Qaeda contacts, all right?

912
01:05:54,844 --> 01:05:58,489
No one too extreme. Picture somewhere
in between Osama and Oprah.

913
01:05:58,650 --> 01:05:59,731
You get my drift?

914
01:05:59,900 --> 01:06:03,032
I'm gonna need a security consultant,
a lawyer.

915
01:06:03,195 --> 01:06:06,195
I'm gonna need an Arab who travels
throughout the region, all right?

916
01:06:06,364 --> 01:06:10,554
A businessman. Someone who fits the role
of jihadist without actually being jihadist.

917
01:06:10,717 --> 01:06:11,829
A straw man.

918
01:06:13,179 --> 01:06:16,760
Receiving money, making plans.

919
01:06:16,925 --> 01:06:18,746
That kind of thing.

920
01:06:19,516 --> 01:06:21,456
Okay, no.

921
01:06:21,628 --> 01:06:23,286
No.

922
01:06:23,452 --> 01:06:24,630
No.

923
01:06:26,077 --> 01:06:28,628
Hang on. There you go.
Second from the top.

924
01:06:28,797 --> 01:06:31,545
Omar Sadiki. He's Jordanian.
He's an architect.

925
01:06:32,411 --> 01:06:36,153
Most of his commissions
are from charitable Islamic groups...

926
01:06:36,318 --> 01:06:38,103
...who then give money to the jihadists.

927
01:06:38,268 --> 01:06:40,635
So he ticks all the jihadist boxes...

928
01:06:40,795 --> 01:06:43,545
...except he's innocent.

929
01:06:43,708 --> 01:06:46,458
So he touches his head to the floor
five times a day.

930
01:06:46,621 --> 01:06:49,076
He believes in God.

931
01:06:49,244 --> 01:06:52,342
So why would he trade
with an infidel like myself?

932
01:06:54,268 --> 01:06:55,382
Money.

933
01:07:16,860 --> 01:07:18,998
Mr. Sadiki.

934
01:07:21,532 --> 01:07:23,094
Hello, Mr. Sadiki.

935
01:07:23,260 --> 01:07:26,423
Mr. Sadiki, it's Brad Scanlon
from Hayes Andover Bank.

936
01:07:26,588 --> 01:07:28,791
I'm following up on my email.

937
01:07:29,371 --> 01:07:30,353
Yeah.

938
01:07:30,525 --> 01:07:33,242
Yeah, well, listen,
I got into Dubai a little bit early.

939
01:07:33,403 --> 01:07:39,119
I'm staying at the Jumeirah Emirates
Towers, but I can meet you anywhere.

940
01:07:39,291 --> 01:07:40,918
Well, fantastic.

941
01:07:47,996 --> 01:07:49,369
Anything else to know?

942
01:07:49,532 --> 01:07:51,059
Exactly as we discussed.

943
01:07:51,483 --> 01:07:52,465
I'm cool with that.

944
01:07:52,635 --> 01:07:55,003
- I'm used to knowing nothing.
- I'm sure you are, Tony.

945
01:07:55,164 --> 01:07:57,652
- Just get in position.
- Okay, boss.

946
01:07:59,708 --> 01:08:01,431
Mr. Sadiki.
- Yeah.

947
01:08:01,597 --> 01:08:06,264
Hayes Andover's option to buy this property
is gonna expire by the end of the month.

948
01:08:06,429 --> 01:08:08,501
We're hoping to get some sketches
and a bid...

949
01:08:08,668 --> 01:08:11,253
...by, say, next Thursday
before the Islamic weekend.

950
01:08:11,420 --> 01:08:13,275
Well, I think...

951
01:08:13,438 --> 01:08:14,746
- Yes, certainly.
- Hm.

952
01:08:14,907 --> 01:08:17,756
You'll also have to sign a letter of intent
with Mr. Al-Masri...

953
01:08:17,914 --> 01:08:19,412
...if that's okay with you.

954
01:08:19,579 --> 01:08:21,105
- Makes no difference to me.
- Great.

955
01:08:21,275 --> 01:08:25,912
- Allah will decide if I get the job or not.
- Fantastic.

956
01:08:26,078 --> 01:08:27,798
Mr. Al-Masri?

957
01:08:28,314 --> 01:08:29,297
Mr. Omar Sadiki.

958
01:08:35,676 --> 01:08:38,131
- Would anyone like some coffee?
- Yes, please. Thank you.

959
01:08:38,300 --> 01:08:41,496
<i>Ed, Al-Masri
is a lawyer we found with al Qaeda ties.</i>

960
01:08:41,659 --> 01:08:44,443
<i>He's fairly low on the map,
but he is on the map...</i>

961
01:08:44,605 --> 01:08:48,085
<i>...enough for a photograph
to suggest Sadiki's guilt by association.</i>

962
01:08:48,252 --> 01:08:50,356
Mm-hm. You have his computer?

963
01:08:51,069 --> 01:08:53,042
Yeah, look,
I'm gonna go get it right now.

964
01:08:53,212 --> 01:08:55,797
He's going to the Cyclone Club.
He loves the Russian girls.

965
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:58,418
I'll call you soon. Call you soon.

966
01:08:59,644 --> 01:09:01,237
Three-sixteen.

967
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:43,667
Come on, baby.

968
01:09:49,341 --> 01:09:50,615
- Garland?
- Yeah?

969
01:09:50,779 --> 01:09:52,470
<i>Stand by. All right?</i>

970
01:09:53,755 --> 01:09:56,309
Just getting in right now.

971
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:08,849
Ah. This is useful.

972
01:10:09,501 --> 01:10:11,573
Very useful.

973
01:10:11,739 --> 01:10:16,409
I have an e-mail list of the members
of the Brothers of Awareness.

974
01:10:16,573 --> 01:10:18,546
<i>The Brothers of who-the-fuck?</i>

975
01:10:18,715 --> 01:10:22,228
The Ikhwan Ishfan. They're just a study
group of believers at his local mosque.

976
01:10:22,395 --> 01:10:24,282
But I can make it look like anything.

977
01:10:24,444 --> 01:10:27,511
All right. Let's make it look
like everything, huh?

978
01:10:35,037 --> 01:10:38,516
Now, make fake accounts
for half a dozen of the brothers...

979
01:10:38,682 --> 01:10:42,393
<i>...and start transferring money to them
from Sadiki's fake receiver account.</i>

980
01:10:42,555 --> 01:10:44,378
<i>Just small operational sums.</i>

981
01:10:44,538 --> 01:10:45,783
Okay.

982
01:10:49,307 --> 01:10:52,822
The Saudis will pick up the money moving,
and everything they pick up...

983
01:10:52,987 --> 01:10:55,323
They'll leak to the jihadists.

984
01:10:55,484 --> 01:10:59,095
<i>- You got it, my friend.
- It's coming up. Now it's done.</i>

985
01:11:35,420 --> 01:11:37,144
Dad! Dad!

986
01:11:37,979 --> 01:11:40,184
Hey, baby. Hold on. Oh.

987
01:11:42,684 --> 01:11:44,985
<i>Hey, Ed, you there?
- Where are you?</i>

988
01:11:45,149 --> 01:11:47,417
Dubai International. I'm on my way back.

989
01:11:47,579 --> 01:11:50,362
No, no, no. No, you're not.
You're going back to Amman.

990
01:11:50,908 --> 01:11:53,494
- Hani called, asked where you were.
- Jesus Christ.

991
01:11:53,658 --> 01:11:56,560
If you don't go back,
he's gonna wonder why you didn't go back.

992
01:11:56,730 --> 01:11:58,836
I think he likes you, buddy.
Change your ticket.

993
01:11:59,002 --> 01:12:01,850
- All right, Ed. I'm on my way.
- All right.

994
01:12:02,011 --> 01:12:04,662
- Oh, hey. Can I get that for you?
- Thank you.

995
01:12:11,899 --> 01:12:14,354
Mr. Ferris. Welcome.

996
01:12:14,524 --> 01:12:16,596
- Thank you.
- Come.

997
01:12:27,323 --> 01:12:32,057
I wanted to see you to tell you
I was sorry how we left things.

998
01:12:32,507 --> 01:12:35,823
- I was upset.
- Well, you had every right to be upset, sir.

999
01:12:35,994 --> 01:12:37,752
I apologize for what happened.

1000
01:12:38,747 --> 01:12:40,722
But I am happy you are back.

1001
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:43,867
Miss Aisha, too, I think,
will be happy you are back.

1002
01:12:44,699 --> 01:12:48,792
Don't worry, we're not watching you.
We're watching out for you.

1003
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:52,979
But I need you to understand, you
cannot afford any more mistakes in Jordan.

1004
01:12:53,979 --> 01:12:57,078
This is a part of the world
where friendship matters.

1005
01:12:57,854 --> 01:12:59,707
It can save your life.

1006
01:12:59,899 --> 01:13:03,641
Why don't I call you back in about
15 minutes with all the information?

1007
01:13:03,802 --> 01:13:05,975
Well, thanks so much, Mr. Sadiki.

1008
01:13:07,037 --> 01:13:08,823
Let's get something clear, all right?

1009
01:13:08,988 --> 01:13:11,027
I'm not tolerating any more
of your bullshit.

1010
01:13:11,195 --> 01:13:13,139
- No, it's cool.
- Who do you work for?

1011
01:13:13,307 --> 01:13:16,274
- I work for you. I got the call, I got briefed.
- All right, good.

1012
01:13:16,444 --> 01:13:18,930
- Front? Back?
- Take my bag.

1013
01:13:29,755 --> 01:13:34,194
If you're going to insist on coming here
to see me...

1014
01:13:34,363 --> 01:13:36,698
...which is what you're doing...

1015
01:13:36,859 --> 01:13:40,307
...my sister's going to want to meet you.

1016
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:43,412
Your sister?

1017
01:13:43,581 --> 01:13:48,054
Yeah, my sister looks after me
in matters that are non-medical.

1018
01:13:50,076 --> 01:13:54,199
Oh, so she has to approve of me
before you will begin to.

1019
01:13:55,453 --> 01:13:58,997
I would like her to think so,
whenever I can.

1020
01:14:01,085 --> 01:14:02,065
Okay.

1021
01:14:35,610 --> 01:14:37,237
- Hi.
- Hi.

1022
01:14:37,403 --> 01:14:38,680
I'm still cooking.

1023
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:41,427
- Come in.
- I brought some dessert, pastry.

1024
01:14:41,595 --> 01:14:43,667
Oh, the kids are going to love it.

1025
01:14:43,835 --> 01:14:44,916
- The kids?
- Yeah.

1026
01:14:45,083 --> 01:14:47,505
- Aha.
- Come.

1027
01:14:49,788 --> 01:14:52,886
This is my sister, Cala.

1028
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:55,472
Mr. Ferris.

1029
01:14:56,859 --> 01:15:01,015
And these are my nephews,
Yousef and Rowley.

1030
01:15:01,177 --> 01:15:02,640
Hello.

1031
01:15:02,813 --> 01:15:04,305
Yousef. Rowley. Hey.

1032
01:15:04,475 --> 01:15:05,815
Hi.
Hi.

1033
01:15:05,979 --> 01:15:08,434
- Nephews.
- Yeah, my nephews.

1034
01:15:14,332 --> 01:15:16,502
Smells good in there, huh?

1035
01:15:16,668 --> 01:15:18,609
It's not good.

1036
01:15:21,403 --> 01:15:22,712
It's not good?

1037
01:15:22,876 --> 01:15:25,721
- You don't like your mother's cooking?
- No, not really.

1038
01:15:26,042 --> 01:15:27,025
Oh.

1039
01:15:33,113 --> 01:15:35,154
What kind of food do you like?

1040
01:15:35,323 --> 01:15:36,751
Hamburgers.

1041
01:15:36,923 --> 01:15:39,061
- You?
- Spaghettis.

1042
01:15:39,226 --> 01:15:40,853
Me too.

1043
01:15:41,020 --> 01:15:44,979
So if there's anything that I wouldn't like,
would you two let me know?

1044
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:48,021
- Okay.
- Yeah.

1045
01:15:48,188 --> 01:15:49,201
Cool.

1046
01:16:01,945 --> 01:16:05,014
So, Mr. Ferris...

1047
01:16:05,532 --> 01:16:07,573
...how long are you in Amman?

1048
01:16:08,314 --> 01:16:09,329
Oh, uh, ahem.

1049
01:16:09,497 --> 01:16:13,296
Well, I think I'm gonna be for a while.
I hope so, anyway.

1050
01:16:15,899 --> 01:16:18,037
Where were you stationed before?

1051
01:16:19,420 --> 01:16:20,432
Riyadh.

1052
01:16:21,435 --> 01:16:22,579
- Riyadh?
Hm.

1053
01:16:27,065 --> 01:16:29,368
What do you do exactly?

1054
01:16:29,595 --> 01:16:33,488
I told you, Cala, he's a political adviser.

1055
01:16:33,658 --> 01:16:35,634
Political adviser.

1056
01:16:35,802 --> 01:16:38,868
But what does that mean?
Forgive my ignorance.

1057
01:16:39,034 --> 01:16:41,685
- It means, uh...
- It means that I...

1058
01:16:41,851 --> 01:16:46,390
Well, I offer my assistance to
His Majesty's advisers whenever they ask.

1059
01:16:52,025 --> 01:16:54,873
But you do this now, not before the war.

1060
01:16:55,036 --> 01:16:57,752
Before you didn't consult with us at all.

1061
01:16:57,916 --> 01:17:01,046
- Cala, please, we are just having lunch.
- It's okay.

1062
01:17:01,212 --> 01:17:02,520
- It's okay.
We can talk...

1063
01:17:02,682 --> 01:17:05,432
- I'm talking with your friend.
Talk about another subject.

1064
01:17:05,595 --> 01:17:07,284
It's quite all right. I understand.

1065
01:17:07,449 --> 01:17:10,648
And we understand
that the situation in Iraq...

1066
01:17:10,811 --> 01:17:14,739
...has created many hardships
for the Jordanian people.

1067
01:17:15,386 --> 01:17:17,297
- The situation?
- You mean, the war.

1068
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,856
- He means war.
- No, no, no, he says the situation.

1069
01:17:20,025 --> 01:17:21,654
- What do you mean?
You know what...

1070
01:17:21,819 --> 01:17:23,029
Please.

1071
01:17:23,194 --> 01:17:26,970
I mean the roadside bombings,
the assassination of Iraqi police...

1072
01:17:27,131 --> 01:17:29,497
...the kidnappings,
the crowded marketplaces...

1073
01:17:29,658 --> 01:17:32,886
...and innocent families that have
been wiped off the face of the Earth.

1074
01:17:33,051 --> 01:17:35,287
That's what I mean
by the situation in Iraq.

1075
01:17:39,162 --> 01:17:41,878
I can tell you what
His Majesty's thinking.

1076
01:17:42,970 --> 01:17:46,288
His Majesty believes the best hope
for the war is that it ends.

1077
01:17:46,842 --> 01:17:49,231
Well, I can tell you
that is my hope as well.

1078
01:17:49,881 --> 01:17:51,792
I hope so too. Huh?

1079
01:17:51,962 --> 01:17:55,738
Cala? Hey. Peace.

1080
01:17:55,899 --> 01:17:58,484
- Let's have lunch, huh?
Okay.

1081
01:17:58,650 --> 01:18:00,112
Enjoy.

1082
01:18:00,282 --> 01:18:01,775
Thank you.

1083
01:18:04,859 --> 01:18:07,247
- Well, sorry about that.
- Ah, so am I.

1084
01:18:07,417 --> 01:18:10,930
I probably should've kept my mouth shut.
After all, I was a guest in your home.

1085
01:18:11,099 --> 01:18:13,238
So is she. It didn't stop her, you know?

1086
01:18:13,404 --> 01:18:16,600
She suffered a lot during Iran-Iraq war.

1087
01:18:16,761 --> 01:18:20,623
And the funny thing
is that she wants to live in America.

1088
01:18:20,793 --> 01:18:21,810
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

1089
01:18:21,979 --> 01:18:25,176
Well, tell her I'll switch passports with her.
It'll make us both happy.

1090
01:18:25,337 --> 01:18:27,159
Don't joke about these kind of things.

1091
01:18:27,323 --> 01:18:31,895
I'm not joking. I'm perfectly serious.
I may stay here forever. Really.

1092
01:18:33,466 --> 01:18:36,599
Well, anyway, I'm glad I made friends
with her boys. I like them a lot.

1093
01:18:36,762 --> 01:18:38,518
Yeah, they're great, aren't they?

1094
01:18:38,681 --> 01:18:41,782
But not very good spies, you know?
Neither are you.

1095
01:18:41,948 --> 01:18:42,930
What do you mean?

1096
01:18:43,099 --> 01:18:44,506
- At the table, you know?
- Oh.

1097
01:18:45,243 --> 01:18:47,960
So you noticed. All right. I'm busted.

1098
01:18:48,123 --> 01:18:50,992
Well, thank you, Aisha,
for inviting me in your home.

1099
01:18:51,643 --> 01:18:52,690
Um...

1100
01:18:58,234 --> 01:18:59,828
Sorry.

1101
01:19:00,604 --> 01:19:02,707
- I had a really nice time.
- Sorry. Yeah, me too.

1102
01:19:03,546 --> 01:19:06,612
- Thank you for coming.
- Thank you.

1103
01:19:16,314 --> 01:19:20,341
HANl: The photograph was taken last week
in the Cyclone Club in Dubai.

1104
01:19:20,507 --> 01:19:22,034
One is Al-Masri, a lawyer...

1105
01:19:22,203 --> 01:19:26,938
...a low-level al Qaeda financier,
if that's not a contradiction in terms.

1106
01:19:27,097 --> 01:19:29,432
The other is a Jordanian.

1107
01:19:29,594 --> 01:19:32,180
An architect named Omar Sadiki.

1108
01:19:33,402 --> 01:19:35,028
No known terrorist ties.

1109
01:19:35,194 --> 01:19:40,823
Now, the question I ask myself is,
is what are they doing together?

1110
01:19:45,500 --> 01:19:48,368
Is this Sadiki more than he claims to be?

1111
01:19:48,956 --> 01:19:50,068
He travels a lot.

1112
01:19:50,489 --> 01:19:53,305
He builds mosques and shopping malls.

1113
01:19:53,466 --> 01:19:56,282
At the very least,
he bears examination by us.

1114
01:19:56,442 --> 01:19:58,350
Or by we.

1115
01:19:58,779 --> 01:20:00,152
Hm.

1116
01:20:01,721 --> 01:20:02,934
Where'd you get these?

1117
01:20:03,898 --> 01:20:06,069
- A friend in Saudi Intelligence.
- Mm.

1118
01:20:06,746 --> 01:20:08,119
Useful friend, huh?

1119
01:20:16,922 --> 01:20:18,296
No, keep it.

1120
01:20:18,939 --> 01:20:20,912
I want you to have it.

1121
01:20:21,082 --> 01:20:24,313
We are partners. Allies, no?

1122
01:20:25,305 --> 01:20:28,024
Why would we not want
to help each other?

1123
01:20:28,186 --> 01:20:31,154
Right. Thank you.

1124
01:20:31,610 --> 01:20:33,301
<i>Garland.
Yeah?</i>

1125
01:20:33,467 --> 01:20:36,402
<i>Pull up an Arabic keyboard
and write down this message, you ready?</i>

1126
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:37,552
Okay.

1127
01:20:37,722 --> 01:20:40,091
In the name of Go...
No, you know what, strike that.

1128
01:20:40,250 --> 01:20:42,552
In the name of God the merciful...

1129
01:20:42,716 --> 01:20:45,104
<i>...we praise our brothers
who shall carry out...</i>

1130
01:20:45,274 --> 01:20:47,543
<i>...this heroic act in the fig orchard...</i>

1131
01:20:47,707 --> 01:20:50,673
...and beg God to give us strength
for our continuing struggle.

1132
01:20:50,842 --> 01:20:52,981
The time is at hand. All right?

1133
01:20:53,146 --> 01:20:56,943
Now, that's absolutely delightful Arabic,
but what the fuck is the fig orchard?

1134
01:20:57,114 --> 01:20:59,962
<i>I can't let you in on that yet.
Let's just say it's developing.</i>

1135
01:21:00,122 --> 01:21:01,266
It'll create chatter...

1136
01:21:01,434 --> 01:21:04,751
...but it's gotta be big enough
for Al-Saleem, to get his attention.

1137
01:21:05,179 --> 01:21:06,292
Oh, it'll be big.

1138
01:21:06,458 --> 01:21:09,175
Now, send that off
from Sadiki's fake e-mail address...

1139
01:21:09,338 --> 01:21:10,930
<i>...and we are in business.</i>

1140
01:21:11,099 --> 01:21:12,310
Okay. Done.

1141
01:21:25,337 --> 01:21:27,380
<i>Advise when you're on the deck.</i>

1142
01:21:37,913 --> 01:21:40,761
<i>Hello there, Mr. Sadiki.
It's Brad Scanlon.</i>

1143
01:21:40,923 --> 01:21:44,436
I'm fine. Thanks so much for asking.
But we've got a bit of a problem.

1144
01:21:44,601 --> 01:21:47,286
You see, our chief engineer,
who's based out of Ankara...

1145
01:21:47,451 --> 01:21:50,867
...he's raised some issues
about the insulation.

1146
01:21:51,034 --> 01:21:53,719
I realize it's the same stuff
that you use in Saudi Arabia...

1147
01:21:53,881 --> 01:21:57,296
...but he's asked
to meet with you immediately.

1148
01:21:57,466 --> 01:22:00,282
No, I'm sorry, sir.
He cannot fly up to see you.

1149
01:22:00,442 --> 01:22:03,510
And the only time he can meet
is tomorrow afternoon.

1150
01:22:03,675 --> 01:22:07,417
But the good news is, we have a car
ready to pick you up in about...

1151
01:22:07,578 --> 01:22:12,051
...oh, six hours, and a plane ticket to Turkey
waiting for you at the airport.

1152
01:22:12,827 --> 01:22:15,673
No, I'm sorry, sir.
First class was not available.

1153
01:22:16,729 --> 01:22:18,836
<i>Ed, Sadiki just landed in Turkey.</i>

1154
01:22:19,002 --> 01:22:20,757
<i>He's being met by one of our guys.</i>

1155
01:22:20,922 --> 01:22:24,305
<i>An engineer to discuss business
and to show him a good time.</i>

1156
01:22:24,474 --> 01:22:26,809
<i>All we need is to establish
that he is there.</i>

1157
01:22:27,002 --> 01:22:28,912
<i>- Mm-hm.
- Now, the barracks at the base...</i>

1158
01:22:29,082 --> 01:22:30,970
<i>...have been cleared out of all personnel.</i>

1159
01:22:31,130 --> 01:22:33,136
<i>Bodies from the morgue
have been brought in.</i>

1160
01:22:33,306 --> 01:22:36,088
<i>They'll be our so-called casualties.</i>

1161
01:22:36,252 --> 01:22:40,440
<i>Now, Garland will send out a message
from Sadiki hinting that a strike is prepared.</i>

1162
01:22:40,603 --> 01:22:41,943
And when the strike is done...

1163
01:22:42,108 --> 01:22:45,555
...he'll post another message taking
responsibility for our little event.

1164
01:22:45,724 --> 01:22:47,609
- You got that?
- Uh-huh.

1165
01:22:47,771 --> 01:22:48,980
<i>After that...</i>

1166
01:22:49,145 --> 01:22:52,690
...hopefully a buzz of messages
will then pass among jihadists' networks...

1167
01:22:52,858 --> 01:22:56,787
<i>...announcing the Brothers of Awareness
as a new player.</i>

1168
01:22:56,954 --> 01:22:59,506
And our Sadiki as its leader.
You got that?

1169
01:22:59,673 --> 01:23:01,268
<i>All right, Ferris. Thank you.</i>

1170
01:23:01,434 --> 01:23:02,743
<i>Tony, you have a go.</i>

1171
01:23:09,882 --> 01:23:11,573
<i>We have a special report.</i>

1172
01:23:11,738 --> 01:23:14,673
<i>A massive explosion
has taken place in Incirlik, Turkey.</i>

1173
01:23:14,842 --> 01:23:17,841
<i>Officials have confirmed the
target of the blast to be the U.S. Air Base...</i>

1174
01:23:19,162 --> 01:23:22,708
<i>...at Incirlik, Turkey. The bomb ripped
through the Bachelor Officers' Quarters...</i>

1175
01:23:22,875 --> 01:23:24,947
<i>...at 3:00 this morning,
quickly engulfing it in flames.</i>

1176
01:23:26,426 --> 01:23:28,945
<i>No one yet has claimed responsibility
for the attack.</i>

1177
01:23:29,113 --> 01:23:32,658
<i>But terror experts are already speculating
this is the work of a new...</i>

1178
01:23:32,826 --> 01:23:36,274
<i>...much more sophisticated and much
better financed offshoot of al Qaeda...</i>

1179
01:23:36,442 --> 01:23:38,777
<i>...than that which is responsible
for the bombings...</i>

1180
01:23:38,939 --> 01:23:41,590
<i>...in Amsterdam, London
and other European cities.</i>

1181
01:23:41,755 --> 01:23:43,511
<i>In contrast to these recent bombings...</i>

1182
01:23:43,675 --> 01:23:46,989
<i>...this is the first attack
to occur on American property.</i>

1183
01:23:47,162 --> 01:23:48,373
<i>- The Pentagon...
Honey.</i>

1184
01:23:48,538 --> 01:23:51,921
<i>...will not release the names of the dead
until notification of next of kin.</i>

1185
01:23:52,090 --> 01:23:54,710
<i>We're also being told that there
may never be a public announcement...</i>

1186
01:23:54,873 --> 01:23:55,855
Honey.

1187
01:23:56,025 --> 01:23:58,065
<i>...of the list of casualties
since some of the men killed...</i>

1188
01:23:58,234 --> 01:24:00,984
<i>...may have been stationed at Incirlik
on classified missions.</i>

1189
01:24:01,145 --> 01:24:04,855
<i>Incirlik, which in Turkish means fig orchard,
has served since September the 11 th...</i>

1190
01:24:05,019 --> 01:24:08,337
<i>...as a primary hub in the wars
in Afghanistan and Iraq.</i>

1191
01:24:08,506 --> 01:24:11,823
All right, now send out the message
taking credit.

1192
01:24:11,996 --> 01:24:15,541
But make the responses go back
to Sadiki's actual account.

1193
01:24:15,707 --> 01:24:18,095
<i>- You got that?
- Okay.</i>

1194
01:24:22,873 --> 01:24:27,314
I can't say it's been real,
but you know what I mean.

1195
01:24:27,930 --> 01:24:28,944
Yeah.

1196
01:24:45,018 --> 01:24:48,815
AL-SALEEM

1197
01:25:18,969 --> 01:25:21,007
SADIKl:

1198
01:27:54,360 --> 01:27:55,985
<i>Hey there, little buddy.</i>

1199
01:27:56,503 --> 01:28:00,115
<i>Well done. You did it.
NSA's picking up all kinds of chatter.</i>

1200
01:28:00,279 --> 01:28:01,394
<i>Haven't heard for years.</i>

1201
01:28:01,560 --> 01:28:05,356
One voice on a world phone out of Vienna
sounds a lot like Al-Saleem himself.

1202
01:28:05,529 --> 01:28:08,912
<i>Saying something along the lines of,
"Who the damn heck is Omar Sadiki?"</i>

1203
01:28:09,081 --> 01:28:13,073
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Listen,
I made a decision, Ed. I'm bringing him in.

1204
01:28:13,240 --> 01:28:15,793
<i>- Who?
- Omar Sadiki, that's who.</i>

1205
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:17,454
Oh, come on. No, no, no.

1206
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:21,104
When they find him, they are gonna
torture him and they are gonna kill him.

1207
01:28:21,273 --> 01:28:24,818
You gotta decide which side of the cross
you're on. I need nailers, not hangers.

1208
01:28:24,984 --> 01:28:27,221
Decision's already done, Ed.
I'm bringing him in.

1209
01:28:27,384 --> 01:28:30,231
Ain't nobody innocent
in this shit, Ferris. Okay?

1210
01:28:31,417 --> 01:28:32,399
Ferris.

1211
01:28:33,208 --> 01:28:35,891
All right, don't move until I say, all right?

1212
01:28:41,434 --> 01:28:42,838
<i>You got me?</i>

1213
01:28:49,273 --> 01:28:50,701
Omar.

1214
01:28:50,872 --> 01:28:53,523
It's Brad Scanlon.
We need to have a conversation. Come on.

1215
01:28:53,689 --> 01:28:55,511
What are you doing here?

1216
01:29:00,505 --> 01:29:03,439
Fuck! Omar! Omar, open the door!

1217
01:29:03,608 --> 01:29:04,622
Let's go!

1218
01:29:04,792 --> 01:29:07,060
Omar, listen to me!

1219
01:29:07,224 --> 01:29:08,752
Omar! Omar!

1220
01:29:09,399 --> 01:29:11,539
Let's go! Go, go, go!

1221
01:29:23,769 --> 01:29:25,198
Fuck!

1222
01:29:32,440 --> 01:29:35,192
This is Roger Ferris. I need an ambulance.

1223
01:30:42,520 --> 01:30:44,430
LIEUTENANT:

1224
01:31:31,735 --> 01:31:33,427
Yeah.

1225
01:31:33,591 --> 01:31:35,632
<i>Sadiki is dead.</i>

1226
01:31:36,568 --> 01:31:38,162
<i>You there?</i>

1227
01:31:38,328 --> 01:31:39,639
Yeah, I'm here.

1228
01:31:39,801 --> 01:31:41,622
I didn't kill him, buddy.

1229
01:31:41,784 --> 01:31:42,896
<i>I know you didn't, Ed.</i>

1230
01:31:44,503 --> 01:31:45,966
I did.

1231
01:31:46,136 --> 01:31:49,585
Oh, buddy.
Buddy, that's just not constructive. Okay?

1232
01:31:49,752 --> 01:31:52,568
- Then what is?
- Doing exactly what you're doing.

1233
01:31:52,729 --> 01:31:56,338
And how are you measuring that? By how
much closer you've gotten to Al-Saleem?

1234
01:31:56,503 --> 01:31:59,635
I bet you heard a shitload of chatter,
then it stopped, didn't it?

1235
01:31:59,801 --> 01:32:01,045
That's right.

1236
01:32:01,208 --> 01:32:03,118
<i>Well, then where is Al-Saleem?</i>

1237
01:32:03,993 --> 01:32:06,360
- Hm?
- Ferris.

1238
01:32:07,033 --> 01:32:09,269
You know what? I've had it.

1239
01:32:09,430 --> 01:32:11,286
I've had it. I can't do this anymore.

1240
01:32:12,024 --> 01:32:13,007
Yes, you can.

1241
01:32:13,176 --> 01:32:15,697
Now, you just get yourself
a couple of hours' sleep.

1242
01:32:15,864 --> 01:32:17,685
And call me
when you're thinking straight.

1243
01:32:17,847 --> 01:32:21,623
You know what? I am thinking straight.
You're not, all right?

1244
01:32:21,784 --> 01:32:24,403
You can't, because you're
a million fucking miles away.

1245
01:32:24,569 --> 01:32:25,975
I'm here, Ed, every day.

1246
01:32:26,136 --> 01:32:28,372
And I see the unnecessary travesties
of this war...

1247
01:32:28,536 --> 01:32:31,832
<i>...that the rest of you backstabbing
political fucking bureaucrats...</i>

1248
01:32:31,992 --> 01:32:33,237
<i>...only look at pictures of.</i>

1249
01:32:33,399 --> 01:32:36,564
So don't you dare tell me
I am not fucking thinking straight!

1250
01:32:38,583 --> 01:32:40,177
This is not working, all right?

1251
01:32:40,345 --> 01:32:42,319
<i>It's not working. I'm out.</i>

1252
01:32:42,488 --> 01:32:44,399
Ferris?

1253
01:32:44,569 --> 01:32:46,478
Ferris?

1254
01:32:49,625 --> 01:32:51,565
I should pack.

1255
01:33:09,336 --> 01:33:11,311
Fuck.

1256
01:33:16,631 --> 01:33:18,158
Fuck!

1257
01:33:36,729 --> 01:33:38,222
Shit!

1258
01:33:38,872 --> 01:33:40,782
Move the fucking car!

1259
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:47,378
- Where's Marwan? Marwan?
Mr. Ferris.

1260
01:34:47,543 --> 01:34:49,038
Please.

1261
01:34:50,423 --> 01:34:53,073
Please, please.
I just need a moment of his time, all right?

1262
01:34:53,239 --> 01:34:54,963
Okay.

1263
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:01,902
Please?

1264
01:35:03,576 --> 01:35:05,430
Please excuse me.

1265
01:35:12,024 --> 01:35:13,716
What is it?

1266
01:35:19,735 --> 01:35:22,639
I invented Omar Sadiki.

1267
01:35:22,807 --> 01:35:25,841
It was my operation.
He is not a jihadist, all right?

1268
01:35:26,007 --> 01:35:29,936
I moved him around, I moved money around,
and then I lost him.

1269
01:35:30,104 --> 01:35:32,405
- That is impossible.
- Why?

1270
01:35:32,569 --> 01:35:36,462
Because it will mean that you sat
in my office and you lied to my face.

1271
01:35:36,631 --> 01:35:40,277
Hani, I promise I will share
all the information with you, all right?

1272
01:35:40,439 --> 01:35:43,636
But they have kidnapped a friend of mine
in order to get to me.

1273
01:35:43,801 --> 01:35:46,101
Now, you know exactly
who I'm talking about, Hani.

1274
01:35:46,265 --> 01:35:49,560
Please, they're gonna execute her,
all right?

1275
01:35:49,720 --> 01:35:52,087
Please, help me broker a deal, her for me.

1276
01:35:52,248 --> 01:35:54,135
You lied to me.

1277
01:35:54,296 --> 01:35:55,702
I will not help you.

1278
01:35:55,863 --> 01:35:58,067
- The answer is no.
- Please, Hani.

1279
01:35:58,231 --> 01:36:00,599
Hani. Hani!

1280
01:36:18,488 --> 01:36:19,863
Ed.

1281
01:36:20,024 --> 01:36:22,871
You should've told me about the girl.
We could've watched her.

1282
01:36:23,032 --> 01:36:24,853
They left the phone.
I know how this goes.

1283
01:36:25,015 --> 01:36:27,055
They've got Aisha
and they want someone.

1284
01:36:27,222 --> 01:36:30,835
- Lf she's alive.
- She has to be alive, right?

1285
01:36:31,288 --> 01:36:34,256
Well, she's probably alive.
At least, they want you to think so.

1286
01:36:34,425 --> 01:36:36,529
- That's the good part.
- And what's the bad part?

1287
01:36:36,695 --> 01:36:38,103
They know about you.

1288
01:36:38,265 --> 01:36:41,265
They know you work for the agency.
That tells me two things.

1289
01:36:41,431 --> 01:36:43,854
One, the people that have Aisha
are running the show...

1290
01:36:44,024 --> 01:36:45,484
...so they're close to Al-Saleem.

1291
01:36:45,657 --> 01:36:48,591
Two, they have learned enough
from Aisha to know she's your pal.

1292
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:50,648
- She's been interrogated.
- Goddamn it.

1293
01:36:50,809 --> 01:36:53,112
- You cannot take this to Hani, right?
- Right. Right.

1294
01:36:53,271 --> 01:36:56,720
- Does that mean you already have?
- Yes. Yes, sir, I have.

1295
01:36:56,887 --> 01:36:57,871
Why would you do that?

1296
01:36:58,039 --> 01:36:59,860
I have to trust everyone I can right now.

1297
01:37:00,024 --> 01:37:02,324
All you gotta do is trust me.

1298
01:37:02,838 --> 01:37:04,213
<i>- What'd he say?
- He said, "Ma'alesh. "</i>

1299
01:37:04,375 --> 01:37:06,264
Because I lied to him,
he's not gonna help.

1300
01:37:13,815 --> 01:37:16,117
Okay. We set this up,
we're gonna do it right.

1301
01:37:16,279 --> 01:37:19,213
- It's not just about you and your girlfriend.
- All right.

1302
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:25,045
This is Roger Ferris.
Will you put Aisha on the phone?

1303
01:37:25,208 --> 01:37:27,926
<i>Okay, mister. Thanks God you are calling.</i>

1304
01:37:28,088 --> 01:37:31,283
<i>I have a question
to make sure you are you. Please.</i>

1305
01:37:31,447 --> 01:37:32,429
Fine.

1306
01:37:32,599 --> 01:37:34,739
<i>Where do you meet Miss Aisha first time?</i>

1307
01:37:34,904 --> 01:37:39,310
<i>At a medical clinic in Amman.
She's a nurse.</i>

1308
01:37:39,479 --> 01:37:42,293
<i>Where do you take Miss Aisha
for dinner first time?</i>

1309
01:37:42,456 --> 01:37:44,180
Go, go.

1310
01:37:44,376 --> 01:37:45,654
Uh...

1311
01:37:45,817 --> 01:37:49,590
I didn't. She invited me
to her apartment for dinner.

1312
01:37:49,752 --> 01:37:51,180
<i>Did you bring anything?</i>

1313
01:37:52,855 --> 01:37:54,515
<i>I did.</i>

1314
01:37:55,288 --> 01:37:57,938
A dessert pastry.

1315
01:37:58,104 --> 01:38:01,070
<i>If you want to see Miss Aisha,
you must go where I say.</i>

1316
01:38:01,689 --> 01:38:05,484
<i>Trade you for her.
No trick or Miss Aisha will die.</i>

1317
01:38:05,654 --> 01:38:07,182
Tell me where I'm to go.

1318
01:38:07,640 --> 01:38:09,135
<i>I'll tell you where to go.</i>

1319
01:38:09,304 --> 01:38:12,118
<i>It is near the border. Highway 15.</i>

1320
01:38:12,279 --> 01:38:15,181
<i>Between Al-Saidi and Mahbrouk.</i>

1321
01:38:15,350 --> 01:38:17,106
<i>That's where you go. Bye.</i>

1322
01:38:53,815 --> 01:38:55,125
Passport.

1323
01:40:43,030 --> 01:40:44,176
Bring up Pacman feed.

1324
01:40:44,344 --> 01:40:46,002
Increase magnification eight time.

1325
01:40:46,168 --> 01:40:48,143
Eight-time mag.

1326
01:40:49,145 --> 01:40:50,256
Enhance resolution.

1327
01:41:07,224 --> 01:41:10,539
Holding at mid-altitude orbit, 12,500...

1328
01:41:19,574 --> 01:41:21,398
<i>Still holding for vector angle.</i>

1329
01:41:32,118 --> 01:41:34,706
Still holding for vector angle.
Switching over to SAR.

1330
01:41:56,470 --> 01:41:58,194
Which one do you want us to follow?

1331
01:42:02,360 --> 01:42:03,765
Which one, sir?

1332
01:42:05,015 --> 01:42:07,024
<i>Sir?</i>

1333
01:42:07,192 --> 01:42:09,101
Sorry, buddy.

1334
01:43:35,064 --> 01:43:38,324
Salaam, CIA.

1335
01:43:42,519 --> 01:43:43,948
I am not the sheik.

1336
01:43:44,119 --> 01:43:47,349
The sheik, God praise him,
is the sheik who always was.

1337
01:43:47,511 --> 01:43:49,234
I am his servant.

1338
01:43:51,064 --> 01:43:53,203
Where is the girl?

1339
01:43:54,007 --> 01:43:55,600
Either you're trying to be clever...

1340
01:43:55,768 --> 01:43:59,728
...or someone has done to you
what you so often do to them.

1341
01:43:59,895 --> 01:44:01,652
Lie.

1342
01:44:02,360 --> 01:44:04,595
So you paid for me? Hm?

1343
01:44:04,760 --> 01:44:06,319
Not as much as I would have.

1344
01:44:06,904 --> 01:44:10,068
Such a bargain for such a catch as you.

1345
01:44:10,230 --> 01:44:14,488
Well, it wasn't a bargain, because
no one's gonna negotiate with you for me.

1346
01:44:14,646 --> 01:44:18,259
That's not our policy. There will be
no exchanges. You understand that, right?

1347
01:44:18,425 --> 01:44:21,904
There will be no negotiation,
but not because you say so.

1348
01:44:22,680 --> 01:44:25,264
I have an agent of the CIA.

1349
01:44:25,815 --> 01:44:30,070
And that's what I came to see.
And that's what matters.

1350
01:44:31,416 --> 01:44:32,626
In this world...

1351
01:44:32,791 --> 01:44:37,680
...there's enough poverty and frustration
and anger and passion.

1352
01:44:37,846 --> 01:44:40,497
There will never be a shortage of martyrs.

1353
01:44:41,238 --> 01:44:44,720
Just like these men, huh?
These men who are dispensable to you.

1354
01:44:44,889 --> 01:44:48,149
These men who blow themselves up
in the name of Allah...

1355
01:44:48,310 --> 01:44:50,733
...who kill their own
brothers and sisters, huh?

1356
01:44:50,903 --> 01:44:54,733
There is no place in the Koran for
the murder of innocent people and suicide.

1357
01:44:54,904 --> 01:44:56,944
- You know that.
- It's a good try.

1358
01:44:57,368 --> 01:45:01,841
But the Koran's sayings...
You speak Arabic, no?

1359
01:45:11,992 --> 01:45:15,766
So you misinterpret the one book
you believe in, hm?

1360
01:45:16,184 --> 01:45:17,708
But are you pure...

1361
01:45:17,878 --> 01:45:22,134
...or are you just as corrupt as the capitalist
Westerners that you despise?

1362
01:45:22,295 --> 01:45:24,301
To me, you are fucking slaves.

1363
01:45:24,470 --> 01:45:28,365
You're slaves to the Saudi oil sheiks
and the Wahabi oil money that funds you.

1364
01:45:28,536 --> 01:45:30,574
And when that oil money runs out,
my friends...

1365
01:45:30,743 --> 01:45:34,703
...you will all fucking disappear
into the ashes of history.

1366
01:45:34,871 --> 01:45:37,805
I am not going to torture you, Mr. Ferris.

1367
01:45:37,975 --> 01:45:42,067
I see you're not going to read
what is prepared for you on paper.

1368
01:45:42,231 --> 01:45:43,213
It's all right.

1369
01:45:43,926 --> 01:45:47,538
All I need from you, I already have.

1370
01:45:47,703 --> 01:45:50,126
You know what that camera is for?

1371
01:45:50,680 --> 01:45:54,095
It's not for this. This...
This is intermission.

1372
01:45:54,743 --> 01:46:00,307
It's for what comes after this.
For what comes now.

1373
01:46:09,431 --> 01:46:10,805
Kareem.

1374
01:46:11,671 --> 01:46:13,581
But you paid who for me?

1375
01:46:13,752 --> 01:46:16,337
An intermediary who works for who?

1376
01:46:16,503 --> 01:46:18,960
You don't know who
and that should concern you.

1377
01:46:19,127 --> 01:46:22,061
- Do I look concerned?
- Well, that's what surprises me.

1378
01:46:22,231 --> 01:46:24,403
I thought you were
a lot smarter than that.

1379
01:46:25,046 --> 01:46:28,496
Someone has betrayed you.

1380
01:46:28,662 --> 01:46:30,997
He works for the head
of Jordanian Intelligence...

1381
01:46:31,159 --> 01:46:32,850
...which means he works for us...

1382
01:46:33,015 --> 01:46:38,798
...which means...
Which means you work for us.

1383
01:46:40,855 --> 01:46:43,856
I work for you.

1384
01:46:54,520 --> 01:46:55,533
Are you comfortable?

1385
01:46:56,216 --> 01:46:58,003
Can I make you...

1386
01:46:58,167 --> 01:47:00,469
...more comfortable?

1387
01:47:06,359 --> 01:47:09,042
I'm not lying to you, Kareem.
I'm not lying to you.

1388
01:47:10,039 --> 01:47:13,520
We know... We know where you are!

1389
01:47:14,743 --> 01:47:16,685
Where am I?

1390
01:47:16,854 --> 01:47:19,702
You... You... You are in the light.

1391
01:47:19,863 --> 01:47:22,646
The light is on you. Look at it.

1392
01:47:23,671 --> 01:47:25,427
No, no, no.

1393
01:47:25,591 --> 01:47:29,136
The light...
The light is on you, motherfucker.

1394
01:47:34,230 --> 01:47:36,621
What do you think is happening here,
Mr. Ferris?

1395
01:47:36,791 --> 01:47:39,158
Do you think the cavalry
is coming for you?

1396
01:47:40,247 --> 01:47:41,939
Let's wait.

1397
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:46,448
Nobody's coming for you.

1398
01:47:46,615 --> 01:47:48,622
Welcome to Guantanamo.

1399
01:47:51,479 --> 01:47:53,618
God! Fuck!

1400
01:48:34,614 --> 01:48:36,240
MAN

1401
01:48:56,725 --> 01:48:57,742
MAN:

1402
01:49:38,296 --> 01:49:39,344
MEN:

1403
01:50:17,078 --> 01:50:18,061
MARWAN:

1404
01:50:40,377 --> 01:50:42,284
HANl: You can tell who cares
about you the most...

1405
01:50:42,456 --> 01:50:45,238
...by who comes first
to visit you in the hospital.

1406
01:50:45,399 --> 01:50:47,854
And I believe I am the first.

1407
01:50:48,024 --> 01:50:50,576
That is not difficult,
because nobody knows where you are.

1408
01:50:50,743 --> 01:50:52,237
Yeah.

1409
01:50:52,407 --> 01:50:54,318
And where am I, Hani?

1410
01:50:54,488 --> 01:50:56,462
You're home, in Amman.

1411
01:50:58,871 --> 01:51:03,507
So it was your man I spoke to
on the phone...

1412
01:51:04,376 --> 01:51:07,277
...your men who took Aisha...

1413
01:51:07,445 --> 01:51:10,032
...your men who dropped me off
in the desert.

1414
01:51:10,198 --> 01:51:13,100
I was of some assistance, I admit.

1415
01:51:13,271 --> 01:51:16,882
But it was not me
that picked you up in the desert.

1416
01:51:17,046 --> 01:51:18,509
Edward could not find you.

1417
01:51:19,063 --> 01:51:22,510
Not with all his aircraft, all his people,
all his money...

1418
01:51:22,680 --> 01:51:25,199
...and joie de vivre.

1419
01:51:25,367 --> 01:51:27,506
So how, I wonder, did I do it?

1420
01:51:27,671 --> 01:51:30,988
- Karami.
- Very good. You remember him?

1421
01:51:31,159 --> 01:51:35,534
Yes, I remember him, Hani.
He was in the fucking room with me.

1422
01:51:35,704 --> 01:51:39,346
He was in the room
because I put him there.

1423
01:51:39,511 --> 01:51:41,845
I'm just sorry
I wasn't there a few minutes sooner.

1424
01:51:42,006 --> 01:51:45,354
Right. What would've happened
if you were a few minutes later, Hani?

1425
01:51:45,527 --> 01:51:48,113
- Then I shudder to think.
- No, I shudder to think.

1426
01:51:49,975 --> 01:51:53,237
How badly did you hurt Aisha
when you took her, huh?

1427
01:51:53,400 --> 01:51:55,822
- That's what I wanna know.
- Aisha, not at all.

1428
01:51:56,949 --> 01:51:59,439
The room we messed up
after we took her.

1429
01:51:59,608 --> 01:52:01,265
Bullshit, Hani, bullshit!

1430
01:52:01,431 --> 01:52:04,278
All right. We tested that blood! All right?
It was hers!

1431
01:52:04,439 --> 01:52:06,960
She is a nurse.
She gives blood every month.

1432
01:52:07,127 --> 01:52:09,547
Now, please, let go of the jacket.
Thank you.

1433
01:52:11,606 --> 01:52:14,836
You're trying to tell me
you didn't tell her, Hani?

1434
01:52:14,998 --> 01:52:18,097
I told her what I could,
which I admit was not very much...

1435
01:52:18,262 --> 01:52:20,564
...because these are matters
of state security.

1436
01:52:20,728 --> 01:52:22,899
So she doesn't know anything
about what happened?

1437
01:52:23,064 --> 01:52:25,932
She knows what everybody
who knows me knows.

1438
01:52:26,103 --> 01:52:29,965
That I am an exceedingly polite gentleman
and a very good conversationalist.

1439
01:52:30,136 --> 01:52:31,542
Huh.

1440
01:52:32,313 --> 01:52:35,158
If I may be so fucking impolite, Hani...

1441
01:52:35,319 --> 01:52:37,840
...I almost died in that goddamn room.

1442
01:52:38,007 --> 01:52:41,487
And if you had died,
I would have told her what you did for her.

1443
01:52:41,655 --> 01:52:45,680
And she...
She would have loved you forever.

1444
01:52:46,327 --> 01:52:49,556
Whereas now you are going
to have to earn that right.

1445
01:52:50,198 --> 01:52:52,588
That's great news.

1446
01:52:54,966 --> 01:52:56,908
Fantastic work, Hani.

1447
01:52:57,079 --> 01:52:59,020
Really. Excellent.

1448
01:52:59,990 --> 01:53:02,064
So you now have Al-Saleem, right?

1449
01:53:02,871 --> 01:53:04,658
That was the plan, my dear.

1450
01:53:06,390 --> 01:53:09,936
And I presume he's not giving you
any information.

1451
01:53:10,104 --> 01:53:11,597
Not yet.

1452
01:53:23,095 --> 01:53:25,135
Your work's done here, buddy.

1453
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:27,860
You're gonna come back.
I got you a corner office...

1454
01:53:28,023 --> 01:53:30,063
...just down the hall from mine.

1455
01:53:30,230 --> 01:53:33,360
As soon as I get the guy who's in it
out of it, it's all yours.

1456
01:53:33,527 --> 01:53:35,664
More money, a fancy title.

1457
01:53:35,829 --> 01:53:39,475
No sunscreen, no couscous,
unless you really want it.

1458
01:53:39,637 --> 01:53:43,217
- Right down the hall from you, huh, Ed?
- Right down the hall from me.

1459
01:53:43,384 --> 01:53:47,313
Well, I think we both know you'd be
more comfortable without me there.

1460
01:53:48,023 --> 01:53:50,838
Now, don't think about it too long,
because I'll take that as a slight.

1461
01:53:50,998 --> 01:53:52,341
Hm.

1462
01:53:52,502 --> 01:53:56,878
Besides, what else are you gonna do?
Stay here?

1463
01:53:57,046 --> 01:53:59,948
Maybe for a little while, huh?
I mean, why wouldn't I?

1464
01:54:00,118 --> 01:54:02,061
Why would you?

1465
01:54:02,327 --> 01:54:04,301
What if I like the Middle East?

1466
01:54:05,783 --> 01:54:09,426
Ain't nobody likes the Middle East, buddy.
There's nothing here to like.

1467
01:54:09,881 --> 01:54:11,372
Hmm.

1468
01:54:11,766 --> 01:54:14,734
Well, maybe that's the problem right there,
isn't it, Ed?

1469
01:54:16,182 --> 01:54:17,493
Hm.

1470
01:54:17,815 --> 01:54:19,759
Oh, buddy, buddy, buddy.

1471
01:54:19,926 --> 01:54:23,921
You know, you're the best I got.

1472
01:54:24,087 --> 01:54:25,744
And you know it hurts me to say that.

1473
01:54:28,631 --> 01:54:31,564
Good luck on winning this war, Ed.

1474
01:54:31,734 --> 01:54:35,314
I hope everyone thinks
you did it all by yourself, huh?

1475
01:54:40,405 --> 01:54:42,229
You're not safe here.

1476
01:54:42,390 --> 01:54:44,082
I'm not safe anywhere.

1477
01:54:44,247 --> 01:54:46,253
You walk out on me,
you know what that means.

1478
01:54:46,422 --> 01:54:48,243
What does that mean?

1479
01:54:49,270 --> 01:54:51,125
That means you're giving up
on America.

1480
01:54:51,768 --> 01:54:55,216
Just be careful calling yourself
America, huh, Ed?

1481
01:54:56,055 --> 01:55:00,528
Listen, you have a safe flight home.
Say hey to the wife and kids.

1482
01:55:00,695 --> 01:55:02,997
Nobody's innocent in this shit, Ferris.

1483
01:56:19,702 --> 01:56:20,685
<i>What's he doing?</i>

1484
01:56:20,854 --> 01:56:22,512
<i>Nothing. Buying vegetables.</i>

1485
01:56:23,605 --> 01:56:26,389
<i>What about us, sir?
What do you want us to do?</i>

1486
01:56:26,551 --> 01:56:28,077
<i>Are we staying with him?</i>

1487
01:56:28,247 --> 01:56:30,996
No. Buddy's done.

1488
01:56:31,158 --> 01:56:32,653
He's all by himself.

1489
01:56:32,823 --> 01:56:36,051
<i>Copy that. Cleared off target.</i>

1490
01:56:37,000 --> 01:56:40,067
