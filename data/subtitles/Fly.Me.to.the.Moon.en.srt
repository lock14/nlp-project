00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:57,914
<i>Weather looks good today.</i>
<i>On schedule for liftoff.</i>

3
00:00:57,991 --> 00:01:00,516
<i>T minus 30 minutes and counting.</i>

4
00:01:00,827 --> 00:01:06,390
<i>In 1957, the Soviet Union</i>
<i>opened the final frontier</i>

5
00:01:06,466 --> 00:01:09,663
<i>by sending the Sputnik
satellite into orbit.</i>

6
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:15,007
<i>Four years later, when NASA was</i>
<i>putting monkeys in its rockets,</i>

7
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:19,444
<i>cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin became
the first man to go into space.</i>

8
00:01:20,613 --> 00:01:25,676
<i>The Soviets were beating the Americans</i>
<i>to every milestone off the planet.</i>

9
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,387
<i>Feeling a sense of urgency</i>

10
00:01:28,455 --> 00:01:32,619
<i>in finding a way to overtake</i>
<i>the Soviets in the space race,</i>

11
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:35,820
<i>President John F. Kennedy</i>
<i>made a momentous statement</i>

12
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:41,094
<i>to a joint session of Congress</i>
<i>on May 25th, 1961.</i>

13
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:45,468
<i> I believe that this nation</i>
<i>should commit itself</i>

14
00:01:45,605 --> 00:01:49,200
<i>to achieving the goal,</i>
<i>before this decade is out,</i>

15
00:01:49,609 --> 00:01:53,773
<i>of landing a man on the moon and
returning him safely to the Earth.</i>

16
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:42,753
<i>Fly me to the moon</i>

17
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:46,822
<i>Let me play among the stars</i>

18
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:50,801
<i>Let me see what spring is like</i>

19
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:54,772
<i>On Jupiter and Mars</i>

20
00:02:55,008 --> 00:03:00,537
<i>In other words hold my hand</i>

21
00:03:02,482 --> 00:03:07,886
<i>In other words, oh, baby, kiss me</i>

22
00:03:14,093 --> 00:03:18,029
<i>Okay,</i> Apollo 10,
<i>prepare for re-entry checklist.</i>

23
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:22,657
<i>Copy that. We are now 101,000
nautical miles from splashdown.</i>

24
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,111
<i>Groovin'</i>

25
00:03:42,855 --> 00:03:45,653
<i>On a Sunday afternoon</i>

26
00:03:47,493 --> 00:03:48,482
<i>Yeah</i>

27
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:52,292
<i>Really, oh, baby</i>

28
00:03:52,365 --> 00:03:55,562
<i>Couldn't get away too soon</i>

29
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:57,034
<i>No, baby</i>

30
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:03,200
<i>I can't imagine</i>
<i>anything that's better</i>

31
00:04:03,276 --> 00:04:08,145
<i>The world is ours</i>
<i>whenever we're together</i>

32
00:04:08,214 --> 00:04:12,207
<i>There ain't a place</i>
<i>I'd like to be instead of</i>

33
00:04:12,285 --> 00:04:14,378
<i>Groovin'</i>

34
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:19,188
Hey, guys! Far out!

35
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,855
I found some double-chocolate layer cake
and pudding, too!

36
00:04:25,498 --> 00:04:29,025
Didn't you just eat
four slices of pepperoni pizza?

37
00:04:29,102 --> 00:04:32,503
What can I say?
I have a fast meatball-ism.

38
00:04:33,006 --> 00:04:35,770
Metabolism. All flies do.

39
00:04:35,842 --> 00:04:38,811
But you, Scooter, you're off the scale.

40
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:40,841
Cool!

41
00:04:40,913 --> 00:04:42,574
That's not a good thing.

42
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,514
Obesity is very rare in flies,

43
00:04:44,584 --> 00:04:47,075
given our propensity
for constant movement and all.

44
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:50,281
Gorging yourself
will lead to respiratory problems,

45
00:04:50,356 --> 00:04:54,224
not to mention difficulty
maintaining a positive self-esteem.

46
00:04:55,695 --> 00:04:57,890
Scooter! That is gross!

47
00:05:03,269 --> 00:05:07,433
So, what's going on
with all the launches over there lately?

48
00:05:07,607 --> 00:05:08,869
Beats me.

49
00:05:09,008 --> 00:05:11,772
Hey, guys! You want some?

50
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:15,069
We're trying to work here, Scooter.

51
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:16,879
Okay.

52
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:20,908
I guess you don't want to hear
what I found out at Mikey's house.

53
00:05:21,921 --> 00:05:25,755
The human's mom makes killer meat loaf
on Tuesdays.

54
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,622
Always chucks the leftovers.

55
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:32,097
Oh! And she made the best
upside-down pineapple cake,

56
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:35,657
with all the frosting,
whipped cream and chocolate syrup!

57
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,499
Enough with the food. What did you hear?

58
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:43,770
- I think the dad works for the space guys.
- Are you talking about NASA?

59
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:50,612
That's it. I overheard them talking
and they said these guys, the astro-nuts...

60
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,311
Astronauts. So, what about them?

61
00:05:53,386 --> 00:05:55,411
Hi, guys. What you doing?

62
00:05:55,755 --> 00:05:58,417
Nothing much. What are you doing here?

63
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:03,219
We're meeting Butch and Ray here.
They're taking us on a big adventure.

64
00:06:03,296 --> 00:06:05,787
Oh, yeah? What kind of adventure?

65
00:06:05,965 --> 00:06:09,264
Nothing much.
Just hopping the train to Kendrick,

66
00:06:09,335 --> 00:06:12,327
grabbing a quick bite
at the treatment plant.

67
00:06:12,472 --> 00:06:14,770
What are you pipsqueaks up to?

68
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:18,641
Looks like they're playing
backyard adventure to me, Butch.

69
00:06:20,813 --> 00:06:24,078
Let me give you kids
a piece of adventuring advice.

70
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:28,280
Be alert.
Think like you got eyes behind your head.

71
00:06:29,322 --> 00:06:31,722
We do have eyes behind our heads.

72
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:33,552
Bingo.

73
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,590
Ladies, shall we leave
these kids to their playtime?

74
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:42,158
Playtime! That's a good one, Butch!

75
00:06:46,172 --> 00:06:49,335
Everybody's going on an adventure,
doing stuff.

76
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:53,738
And what do we do?
We talk about kid stuff.

77
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,380
We are kids.

78
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:57,710
Exactly.

79
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:01,652
So, you were saying about the astronauts?

80
00:07:01,721 --> 00:07:05,748
- They're sending them to the moon.
- What? The moon?

81
00:07:06,492 --> 00:07:11,725
- That's what I heard.
- Wow. That would be so cool.

82
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:15,291
An awesome scientific feat
is what it would be.

83
00:07:15,368 --> 00:07:17,233
I'd like to do something like that.

84
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:20,636
You know, go someplace different,
someplace exotic.

85
00:07:21,307 --> 00:07:25,038
I was at the Pinehill Dump last year
for this all-you-could-eat festival.

86
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:28,376
I'm talking someplace special, not a dump.

87
00:07:28,915 --> 00:07:33,477
We're flies. We buzz around, eat,
make humans go crazy.

88
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,987
What else do you need out of life?

89
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:39,656
If it ain't an adventure,
it ain't worth doing.

90
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,492
Okay, Grandpa McFly.

91
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,558
Oh, no! I forgot!

92
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:45,995
What? What?

93
00:07:46,065 --> 00:07:50,934
It's Grandpa's birthday party. I'm late!
Come on, you guys. You're both invited.

94
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,095
All right!

95
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,047
Hey, wait up, guys!

96
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:11,752
<i>I'm going up the country,</i>
<i>baby, don't you wanna go</i>

97
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,760
<i>I'm going up the country</i>

98
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:17,352
<i>Baby, don't you wanna go</i>

99
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:23,626
<i>I'm going to some place</i>
<i>where I've never been before</i>

100
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,168
Drop the cake!

101
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:35,442
You can't drop perfectly stale cake.
Mom says flies are starving in India.

102
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:05,207
<i>I'm gonna leave this city,</i>
<i>got to get away</i>

103
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:11,343
<i>I'm gonna leave this city,</i>
<i>got to get away</i>

104
00:09:12,184 --> 00:09:14,345
<i>All this fussing and fighting, man</i>

105
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:17,821
<i>You know I sure can't stay</i>

106
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:21,959
<i>Now, baby, pack your leaving trunk,</i>
<i>you know we got to leave today</i>

107
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,187
<i>Just exactly</i>
<i>where we going I cannot say</i>

108
00:09:24,263 --> 00:09:28,723
<i>But we might even</i>
<i>leave the USA</i>

109
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,696
<i>'Cause there's a brand new game</i>
<i>and I wanna play</i>

110
00:09:33,773 --> 00:09:35,001
Louie!

111
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:40,641
Hiya, kid. Well, look at you,
all grown up with the light and all.

112
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:44,205
Careful, the girls will be all over you.

113
00:09:44,283 --> 00:09:46,945
Hiya, Louie. You want some party mold?

114
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,546
Never turn down free mold.

115
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:56,253
Yeah, I'm trying to watch
my weight these days.

116
00:09:56,329 --> 00:09:58,923
You never know
what kind of crap is in these things.

117
00:09:58,998 --> 00:10:04,197
It's a dung ball, stupid!
There isn't anything but crap in it.

118
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,405
So a woman walks into the kitchen,

119
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:11,400
finds her husband walking around
with this huge swatter.

120
00:10:11,644 --> 00:10:15,978
"What are you doing?" she asks.
"Hunting flies," he tells her.

121
00:10:16,048 --> 00:10:18,141
"You get any?" she replies.

122
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:22,387
"Yep, three males, two females."
"How can you tell?"

123
00:10:23,255 --> 00:10:26,224
"Well," he says,
"Three were on the beer can,

124
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,055
"and two were on the phone!"

125
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:35,897
Trust me, it's very funny.

126
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:41,469
Okay, kids, we're wearing Grandpa out.
Go out and play in the garbage.

127
00:10:43,376 --> 00:10:47,403
Stay away from any chemicals!
And don't test the frogs!

128
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:51,973
- How are we holding up, Dad?
- Where's my favorite grandson?

129
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:55,919
Hello, Mrs. McFly.
Happy birthday, Grandpa McFly.

130
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:57,922
Yummy, is this brie?

131
00:10:57,990 --> 00:11:00,254
Scooter, show some manners.

132
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:03,457
I think your grandson and company
have arrived.

133
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:07,192
- Here's my boy.
- Hi, Grandpa. Happy birthday.

134
00:11:07,566 --> 00:11:08,931
What's this?

135
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:12,999
Oh, I remember this flypaper.

136
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,670
Still got some bite to it, don't it?

137
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:18,608
Yes, sir. It was down in Argentina.

138
00:11:19,145 --> 00:11:23,343
Ended up saving ten lives that day,
barely escaped with my own wings intact.

139
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:27,011
Where in tarnation did you ever find it?

140
00:11:27,086 --> 00:11:28,986
Mom had it hidden away.

141
00:11:29,055 --> 00:11:33,458
And it would have stayed that way if it
wasn't for someone's snooping little ways.

142
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:37,155
Curiosity killed the cat.
Think what it would do to a fly.

143
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:41,491
You worry too much, sweetie.
Let him grow up, for darn sake.

144
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:45,867
- Tell your Grandpa here how you're doing.
- Just great. How are you doing?

145
00:11:45,938 --> 00:11:47,872
Not bad for an old fly.

146
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,632
You know any hotties
who want to go honey-dipping?

147
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:53,144
Dad, be nice.

148
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:57,682
I'm gonna go check on the maggots.

149
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:02,112
Grandpa, you think a fly
could ever go to the moon?

150
00:12:02,188 --> 00:12:06,352
The moon? Sure. Anything's possible.

151
00:12:06,826 --> 00:12:08,293
Remember the motto,

152
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,261
if it ain't an adventure,
it ain't worth doing.

153
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:21,203
I ever tell you I once flew across
the Atlantic Ocean with Amelia Earhart?

154
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,707
About a hundred times.

155
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,046
You wanna hear it
a hundred and one times?

156
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,605
Sure. I love that story, Grandpa.

157
00:12:31,283 --> 00:12:33,080
Well, if you insist.

158
00:12:35,054 --> 00:12:39,115
<i>We were about 10 hours into it,</i>
<i>out over the Atlantic Ocean.</i>

159
00:12:43,162 --> 00:12:45,027
<i>Everything was going a-okay,</i>

160
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:50,057
<i>so I thought I'd take myself a little
snooze, catch 40 winks. You know.</i>

161
00:13:08,087 --> 00:13:10,453
<i>Well, no sooner had I dozed off,</i>

162
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:14,790
<i>I woke up to find the plane</i>
<i>in one serious nosedive!</i>

163
00:13:15,094 --> 00:13:16,789
<i>What was wrong, Grandpa?</i>

164
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:20,824
<i>I'll tell you what was wrong.</i>
<i>She gosh darn fell asleep.</i>

165
00:13:22,868 --> 00:13:27,032
<i>That ocean was like black pavement,</i>
<i>and it was coming up real fast!</i>

166
00:13:27,339 --> 00:13:29,102
<i>We were gonna die.</i>

167
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:33,476
<i>- What did you do, Grandpa?</i>
<i>- What any brave fly would do.</i>

168
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,813
<i>I flew straight up her nose.</i>

169
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,322
<i>She blew out one serious booger.</i>
<i>I was almost a goner.</i>

170
00:13:54,066 --> 00:13:56,159
<i>You saved the day, Grandpa.</i>

171
00:13:57,503 --> 00:13:59,130
<i>Darn right, I did.</i>

172
00:14:03,909 --> 00:14:06,935
<i>After that, it was smooth flying.</i>

173
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:13,043
<i>Couple hours later, we landed in France.</i>
<i>The rest is history.</i>

174
00:14:20,125 --> 00:14:22,650
<i>That's when I met Nadia.</i>

175
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:25,697
<i>Who's Nadia?</i>
<i>You never told me about her.</i>

176
00:14:25,764 --> 00:14:28,289
<i>Oh, I guess I haven't.</i>

177
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:32,827
<i>Well, she was just about the prettiest
thing with wings I'd ever seen.</i>

178
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,736
<i>Russian, from Minsk.</i>

179
00:14:34,807 --> 00:14:36,900
Wow. You knew a Russian?

180
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,341
Sure did.

181
00:14:38,410 --> 00:14:41,311
- How come you didn't marry her?
- Well...

182
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:46,311
That's kind of hard to explain.
Wasn't meant to be, I guess.

183
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:51,322
But she could put away the vodka.
We once drank so much, we...

184
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,652
Oh, Nat?

185
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,785
Why don't you go say hello
to your cousin Sheila?

186
00:14:55,861 --> 00:14:59,922
- She just came out of her cocoon.
- Yeah. Sure, Mom.

187
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:04,095
See if anybody needs anything.
Don't let Scooter eat all the food.

188
00:15:04,637 --> 00:15:07,037
Let me know
when you're taking off for the moon!

189
00:15:07,106 --> 00:15:11,509
- I might want to come along with you.
- Don't put crazy ideas in his head, Dad.

190
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,478
Nothing crazy about a boy
having an imagination.

191
00:15:14,546 --> 00:15:15,911
Can't hold him back forever.

192
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:19,280
I'm just trying to prepare him
for the real world out there, Dad.

193
00:15:19,351 --> 00:15:21,512
Dreamers get swatted.

194
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:25,751
Mrs. McFly, one of your maggots
just jumped on the Baxters' dog.

195
00:15:25,824 --> 00:15:29,555
- They're halfway down the block.
- Coming.

196
00:15:31,997 --> 00:15:33,259
All right!

197
00:15:34,066 --> 00:15:38,332
Who wants to twist an antenna
with old Louie?

198
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:50,178
<i>When I don't know what to do</i>

199
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:53,150
<i>I just wanna fly, fly, fly</i>

200
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:58,319
<i>I wanna be with you</i>
<i>and make you dance, dance, dance</i>

201
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:02,926
<i>Baby, baby, baby,</i>
<i>make me feel so hot, hot, hot</i>

202
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:21,106
<i>Let me know</i>
<i>when you're taking off for the moon!</i>

203
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:23,740
<i>I might want to come along with you.</i>

204
00:16:50,709 --> 00:16:53,405
Okay. I've been doing a lot of thinking.

205
00:16:55,681 --> 00:17:00,015
I was doing a lot of sleeping.
Couldn't this have waited until tomorrow?

206
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:03,082
- I'm going to the moon.
- The moon?

207
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:06,352
Are you crazy?
A fly can't make it to the moon.

208
00:17:06,425 --> 00:17:08,359
We can if we hitch a ride.

209
00:17:08,427 --> 00:17:11,055
Wait a minute. What's this "we" stuff?

210
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:14,730
Guys, we've watched a ton of these flights.

211
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,100
They only last a few minutes.
We'll be back before anyone misses us.

212
00:17:19,671 --> 00:17:24,574
Oh, gosh, I don't know.
The odds of making it are...

213
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:27,009
Where's your sense of adventure?

214
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,980
We're always talking about
taking a road trip.

215
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:33,280
Yeah, road trip. Earth. Terra firma.

216
00:17:33,485 --> 00:17:35,180
Is that a dessert?

217
00:17:35,454 --> 00:17:39,481
Oh, just forget it, then.
You don't want to go? I'll go myself.

218
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,985
He's crazy, sleep-deprived.

219
00:17:42,394 --> 00:17:43,725
Nat, wait!

220
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:47,991
What... What are you doing? Let him go.

221
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:50,927
Okay.

222
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,432
Don't do it.

223
00:17:53,505 --> 00:17:54,767
I'm in.

224
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:58,399
You did it.

225
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:03,807
What?

226
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:07,352
Oh, no. You guys don't need me to go.
No way.

227
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,449
- We need you.
- Come on, Scooter. We're a team!

228
00:18:12,324 --> 00:18:14,758
You guys, this is not good.

229
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,052
I've got heartburn just thinking about it.

230
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:19,762
Scooter!

231
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,701
All right. All right, I'm in.

232
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,037
Adventure forever!

233
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:29,106
Dreamers get swatted? Never!

234
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:32,970
All right, first thing we have to do
is finish the space suits.

235
00:18:33,045 --> 00:18:37,641
- Can we get them done by tomorrow?
- Yeah, if I don't sleep.

236
00:18:57,503 --> 00:19:00,495
Kind of late
to be wandering around, isn't it?

237
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,970
I was just getting some fresh air, was all.

238
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:07,944
Really? Gee,
I can smell wood burning a mile away.

239
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,805
Maybe there's a fire at the dump, then.

240
00:19:10,883 --> 00:19:14,649
I'm talking up here.
I'd say the gears are turning pretty hard.

241
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,746
You want to tell your Grandpa
what's going on?

242
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:55,289
So, tell your old Grandpa
what's on your mind,

243
00:19:55,894 --> 00:19:57,919
because I know something is.

244
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:02,865
I want to do something special, Grandpa.
I want to have a big adventure like you.

245
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,099
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

246
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:07,730
You know, I'm all for adventure.

247
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:10,741
Nothing better than
being out there, taking risks,

248
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,868
having that excitement
pumping through you.

249
00:20:12,945 --> 00:20:15,379
Yeah! You can't beat it.

250
00:20:15,447 --> 00:20:19,679
But I'll tell you something.
Sometimes, you gotta know

251
00:20:19,751 --> 00:20:22,743
that maybe you're just not ready
for the big adventure.

252
00:20:22,821 --> 00:20:24,789
I bet you never waited for adventure.

253
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:26,551
You're right about that.

254
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:30,356
But, well, I have come up short.

255
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:32,397
What do you mean "short"?

256
00:20:32,598 --> 00:20:35,396
Well, as a matter of fact,
you talking about the moon tonight

257
00:20:35,467 --> 00:20:39,460
reminded me of the time
I got my first taste of coming up short.

258
00:20:39,538 --> 00:20:43,201
The humans over at NASA
were sending a monkey into space.

259
00:20:43,775 --> 00:20:47,074
<i>Just a handful of years ago,</i>
<i>I was planning on hitching a ride.</i>

260
00:20:47,145 --> 00:20:50,273
<i>I was gonna be the first fly</i>
<i>to go into space.</i>

261
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,783
<i>You actually went into space?</i>

262
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,318
<i>No, not exactly.</i>

263
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:59,713
<i>Darn scientist knocked me clean</i>
<i>off the monkey's head.</i>

264
00:21:05,631 --> 00:21:08,629
<i>Before I knew what hit
me, they were gone!</i>

265
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:11,627
<i>I had missed my shot,
my trip into space.</i>

266
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:16,298
<i>Yeah, kind of knocked me back to Earth,</i>
<i>in a manner of speaking.</i>

267
00:21:16,575 --> 00:21:19,942
<i>I guess somebody was reminding me</i>
<i>I'm an old fly.</i>

268
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:25,776
Ever since then, well, I began thinking
maybe I should start acting my age.

269
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:30,746
Your time will come, little one.
Wait and see.

270
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:33,953
Your time will come.

271
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,877
How'd we make out with the space suits?

272
00:22:30,415 --> 00:22:34,909
Great. Okay, you guys, this is it.
Mikey's house is our ticket to the moon.

273
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,785
I sure hope it's a round-trip ticket.

274
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,791
I need some breakfast.

275
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:08,914
Okay, we split up,
and when the time is right,

276
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,147
we get into the lunch pail.

277
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:13,385
- Okay. Let's do it.
- I can't wait to get in there.

278
00:23:29,074 --> 00:23:33,602
- Scooter! IQ's been hit!
- What? Where is he?

279
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:38,941
IQ, get up! Move!

280
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,412
No!

281
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:56,589
- You okay?
- You guys are gonna give me a heart attack.

282
00:23:56,735 --> 00:24:01,434
- This is gonna be a crazy ride.
- Hurry! She's closing the lunch box!

283
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:14,610
- Thanks, Nat.
- Now we're talking. Breakfast.

284
00:24:26,264 --> 00:24:27,253
Wow!

285
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,843
Moon, here we come.

286
00:25:01,466 --> 00:25:07,234
- Morning, everybody. What's for breakfast?
- I made mold fritters. Where's Nat?

287
00:25:07,305 --> 00:25:10,570
I thought he was down here already.
Wasn't in his bed.

288
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:13,372
Maggots, stop playing with your grease.

289
00:25:13,445 --> 00:25:17,677
Nat, time for breakfast! Where is he?

290
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,376
He's not here. He left.

291
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,654
What do you mean, he left?
Where did he go?

292
00:25:23,722 --> 00:25:26,919
Hi, everybody.
Has my Scooter been here this morning?

293
00:25:26,992 --> 00:25:29,460
- I haven't seen him.
- Are the boys here?

294
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,962
Don't tell us. IQ's missing, too?

295
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:36,399
- Mommy! Mommy! They went to the moon!
- Not now. Mommy's talking.

296
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:39,232
They took a rocket to the moon, Mommy.

297
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:43,870
- What did you say, sweetheart?
- He said rocket! He clearly said rocket.

298
00:25:43,942 --> 00:25:46,410
- I heard moon.
- What's today's date?

299
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:49,136
- Please, not now, Dad.
- Of course!

300
00:25:49,214 --> 00:25:50,272
Of course what?

301
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:53,977
Today's the day the humans are
sending a man to the moon.

302
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:56,449
- Nat's going to the moon!
- Nat's going to the moon!

303
00:25:56,521 --> 00:25:58,614
- Nat's going to the moon!
- Nat's going to the moon!

304
00:25:58,757 --> 00:26:01,555
The heat from the rocket
could kill them!

305
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:04,925
I told IQ, "Never, ever, cross the fence."

306
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:08,898
Oh, my lord of the flies!
They are going to the moon!

307
00:26:18,476 --> 00:26:19,943
Well, I'll be.

308
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:32,854
Hey, man. How's it going?

309
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:35,552
- Good, guys. Everything a-okay?
- Oh, yeah. Good to see you, Ben.

310
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,151
Big day, huh?

311
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,660
What if he doesn't open
his lunch pail?

312
00:26:41,833 --> 00:26:45,269
Don't worry. He'll open it.
Humans love a second cup of coffee.

313
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:48,568
Just remember, when he does,
we get out of here pronto.

314
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:52,906
He'll be swatting at anything that moves.
Regroup on the nearest wall.

315
00:26:56,514 --> 00:26:59,642
Okay. This is it, guys! Be alert.

316
00:27:10,095 --> 00:27:12,154
Whoa, that was close.

317
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:15,829
- He almost got me!
- Where's Scooter?

318
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:17,864
I didn't see him.

319
00:27:17,936 --> 00:27:19,995
There he is! What is he doing?

320
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:23,501
Scooter!

321
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,839
Oh, no. Scooter!

322
00:27:30,682 --> 00:27:34,379
- What's up, guys?
- I thought that was you down there.

323
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:38,650
- Where?
- On the donut. Well, was on the donut.

324
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:43,689
You thought that fatso was me?
I'm insulted.

325
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:52,794
Nice fake-out, fly.

326
00:27:53,605 --> 00:27:57,439
Okay, listen up. Phase one, complete.

327
00:27:57,742 --> 00:27:59,937
Now, we find the astronauts.

328
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:07,878
<i>This is Apollo launch control.</i>

329
00:28:07,952 --> 00:28:12,013
<i>T minus 58 minutes, 55 seconds</i>
<i>and counting.</i>

330
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:16,687
<i>The countdown for</i> Apollo 11 <i>is still
going very satisfactorily at this time.</i>

331
00:28:17,328 --> 00:28:22,061
<i>In most cases, we're a matter of five or ten</i>
<i>minutes ahead of countdown procedures.</i>

332
00:28:25,937 --> 00:28:29,668
Look at all the people here!
How will we ever find them?

333
00:28:30,208 --> 00:28:33,769
If something happens to Nat,
I'll never forgive myself.

334
00:28:35,113 --> 00:28:36,546
Me, too!

335
00:28:36,948 --> 00:28:41,214
Look, gals, I know you're all worried,
but you gotta cut them some slack.

336
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,855
They need adventure in their lives.
Builds character!

337
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:49,360
So, dry up those tears,
'cause your boys are about to make history.

338
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,664
Ah, women!

339
00:28:58,737 --> 00:29:01,968
<iWe've just passed</i>
<i>the 40-minute mark in our countdown.</i>

340
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:05,134
<i>We are still proceeding</i>
<i>in an excellent manner at this time.</i>

341
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:09,169
<i>All elements reporting in that all systems</i>
<i>continuing to look good this morning.</i>

342
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:11,147
We couldn't help but overhear.

343
00:29:11,216 --> 00:29:14,777
Are you the three moms of
those brave flies going to the moon?

344
00:29:14,853 --> 00:29:17,686
- How do you know that?
- They're on TV.

345
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:21,624
We need to find a TV
or somebody who knows what's going on.

346
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,723
Come on. Follow me.

347
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:25,655
Hey, watch out!

348
00:29:57,295 --> 00:29:59,422
<i>We ready to go?</i>
<i>- Ready on 12.</i>

349
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:01,993
<i>Well, we'll stay with you, Kenny.</i>

350
00:30:02,066 --> 00:30:04,296
<i>Be sure you hold that wide shot</i>
<i>at the beginning.</i>

351
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:05,961
<i>It's set up here, right now.
It's going...</i>

352
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:10,833
Look at them.
They really are going to the moon.

353
00:30:15,747 --> 00:30:18,739
I'm not going to faint. I'm not going to...

354
00:30:21,586 --> 00:30:23,281
Here we go again.

355
00:30:40,705 --> 00:30:43,139
Wow! This is beyond cool.

356
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,843
<i>Well, gentlemen,</i>
<i>shall we go make some history?</i>

357
00:30:50,915 --> 00:30:53,076
Copy that. Should be a fun week or so.

358
00:30:53,151 --> 00:30:55,244
- A week?
- A week?

359
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:56,810
A week?

360
00:30:57,555 --> 00:30:59,523
I'm gonna need more food.

361
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:03,184
<i>Starting final countdown.</i>

362
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:07,598
<i>Ten, nine, eight...</i>

363
00:32:44,696 --> 00:32:47,324
Sweetie, they're on their way.

364
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:50,196
Maybe it won't be that bad.
How long could it take?

365
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,884
They go up, they come down.

366
00:32:52,885 --> 00:32:55,501
Sure. It'll be over
in a matter of minutes.

367
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:59,600
I don't think so. I just heard
they're gonna be gone at least a week.

368
00:32:59,677 --> 00:33:01,872
- What?
- Maybe more.

369
00:33:13,558 --> 00:33:16,584
<i> Hello,</i> Apollo 11,
<i>this is mission control in Houston.</i>

370
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:19,892
<i>We're taking over for launch</i>
<i>command center at Cape Canaveral.</i>

371
00:33:19,964 --> 00:33:22,660
<i>Let's run through our
procedural checklist.</i>

372
00:33:22,734 --> 00:33:25,294
<i>Roger that, Houston.</i>
<i>Welcome aboard.</i>

373
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:28,316
- He'll be back before you know it.
- He's never been away from home that long.

374
00:35:28,392 --> 00:35:30,986
Your boy's going to the moon.

375
00:35:31,062 --> 00:35:35,192
I could only dream about doing that,
but he's doing it.

376
00:35:35,266 --> 00:35:39,362
- Everything will be all right, I promise.
- Thanks, Dad.

377
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:41,227
We're family.

378
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:44,433
Just don't give me
that dreamers-get-swatted routine anymore.

379
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:45,498
Okay?

380
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:47,174
I'll try.

381
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:58,450
Apollo 11, <i>this is Houston.
You can terminate battery Bravo charge,</i>

382
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:02,922
<i>and we'd like the crew status report</i>
<i>before we begin TV transmission.</i>

383
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,156
Copy that, Houston.

384
00:36:05,229 --> 00:36:08,528
Fit as a fiddle up here.
We're ready for our close-ups.

385
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,611
Hurry, everybody!
Our boys are gonna be on TV.

386
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,943
We have to find a TV!

387
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:32,319
Hey, there's a Pearson's appliance store
a few blocks from here.

388
00:36:32,390 --> 00:36:35,382
Come on.
We can get there in time if we hurry.

389
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,961
Apollo 11? <i>Houston, again.</i>

390
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:44,763
<i>We will begin our live television
transmission in two minutes.</i>

391
00:36:44,835 --> 00:36:46,359
Copy that, Houston.

392
00:36:46,437 --> 00:36:49,770
Did you hear that, guys?
We're gonna be on TV!

393
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:52,866
- All right.
- What's my best side? Right or left?

394
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:07,753
Did they start yet?

395
00:37:08,226 --> 00:37:10,786
Almost. Hey, look, they're on!

396
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:13,185
<i>Good evening.</i>

397
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:18,664
<i>Tonight, the United States has
entered a new dawn, a new frontier.</i>

398
00:37:18,736 --> 00:37:20,101
<i>In just a few moments' time,</i>

399
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:23,766
<i>we will get the first glimpse</i>
<i>of our intrepid moon travelers.</i>

400
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:26,241
<i>With our connection</i>
<i>inside mission control,</i>

401
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:30,076
<i>we're able to broadcast</i>
<i>the first images inside the capsule.</i>

402
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:33,880
<i>I'm getting word from Houston</i>
<i>that we're ready to go.</i>

403
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:36,943
Apollo 11, <i>Houston.</i>
<i>You are good to go.</i>

404
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:05,745
- Did anybody see that?
- See what, sir?

405
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:10,277
A fly. Three to be exact.
Check out the playback, get back to me.

406
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:14,255
Okay, people,
end transmission, and let's tuck them in.

407
00:38:14,425 --> 00:38:16,706
<i>Apollo 11,</i> Houston.

408
00:38:16,707 --> 00:38:18,987
As far as we can see,
you're cleared for some Zs. Over.

409
00:38:19,063 --> 00:38:21,657
<i>Sounds good to us.
Good night, Houston.</i>

410
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:26,826
- Good night, IQ.
- Night.

411
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:30,763
I did it, Grandpa. I did it.

412
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:32,491
<i>We now have photos</i>
<i>from the American space mission.</i>

413
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:36,336
<i>American astronaut has made
it to the moon before Russia!</i>

414
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:39,032
<i>Kremlin very embarrassed.</i>

415
00:39:41,412 --> 00:39:45,041
How happen this to us?
Someone tell me this.

416
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:46,981
How happen this to us?

417
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:50,452
I want answers. Not yesterday. Today!

418
00:39:50,521 --> 00:39:55,185
- Comrade Poopchev, I will explain.
- I am waiting.

419
00:39:55,259 --> 00:39:57,250
<i> Hi, Mom! Hi, Grandpa!</i>

420
00:39:57,328 --> 00:40:01,389
<i>We did it, Grandpa McFly!</i>
<i>We're headed for the moon!</i>

421
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:07,398
<i>We did it, Grandpa McFly!</i>

422
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:14,035
Nadia, these last few days have been great.
I wish it could last forever.

423
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:19,242
- This world so crazy, no?
- I know. But if only we...

424
00:40:19,316 --> 00:40:24,151
Please, for me, forgive.
I need go back to Russia.

425
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:29,289
My father, he very ill. He need me.

426
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:32,795
Nadia, I'll never forget you.

427
00:40:37,034 --> 00:40:41,869
This killing me.
We must stop Americans getting all glory!

428
00:40:42,473 --> 00:40:45,408
Nadia, I need food when I get angry.

429
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:48,234
For you, Comrade, I make your lunch.

430
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:54,712
What do you propose, Comrade Poopchev?

431
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,482
Do we have operatives
in their mission control in Houston?

432
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,818
Well?

433
00:41:06,564 --> 00:41:08,896
We make slight mistake, Comrade.

434
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:12,402
What kind mistake?
We have no operatives?

435
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:17,403
We send them to launch center in Florida,
not Houston.

436
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:20,205
You idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

437
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:22,837
How are we going to stop Americans from...

438
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:28,075
Wait a Russian minute,
my little idiot friend.

439
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:31,281
Tell me, who we have in Florida?

440
00:41:31,355 --> 00:41:34,722
Two pencil pushers and Yegor.

441
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:40,527
Yegor? This is good. Very good, maybe.

442
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:42,055
It is?

443
00:41:42,132 --> 00:41:45,590
Focus will be on mission control
in Houston.

444
00:41:48,839 --> 00:41:50,033
We make plan,

445
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:55,238
change re-entry codes from
launch command center at Cape Canaveral.

446
00:41:55,312 --> 00:41:59,840
- They never suspect that.
- You are a genius, Comrade. Pure genius!

447
00:41:59,917 --> 00:42:01,441
Stop, I know.

448
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:06,183
Okay! Tell Yegor
his orders are to stop the Americans.

449
00:42:06,757 --> 00:42:11,990
Tell him Mother Russia will wait
with bait on breath.

450
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,730
- No way Americans can succeed.
- No joke.

451
00:42:28,946 --> 00:42:31,847
Is amusing, America.

452
00:42:36,654 --> 00:42:40,249
Apollo 11, <i>this is Houston. Over.</i>
<i>Good morning, Houston.</i>

453
00:42:40,324 --> 00:42:44,158
Apollo 11, <i>we have a little problem</i>
<i>with a potential contaminant aboard.</i>

454
00:42:44,228 --> 00:42:47,664
Copy, Houston. What kind of contaminant?

455
00:42:47,731 --> 00:42:51,633
<i>Flies. We believe you have flies aboard,</i>
<i>and we need to contain them,</i>

456
00:42:52,303 --> 00:42:55,466
<i>eliminate any possible</i>
<i>bacterial cross-contamination.</i>

457
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:59,171
Roger that.
We'll stow them first chance we get.

458
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:06,480
- I slept like a baby.
<i>- Commander Armstrong,</i>

459
00:43:06,550 --> 00:43:08,609
<i>- we're three minutes from lunar orbit...</i>
- I'm hungry.

460
00:43:08,686 --> 00:43:11,120
Is that all you ever think about?

461
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:17,793
- Guys, you smell anything?
- Food?

462
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:19,117
Roger that.

463
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:21,159
What's the problem?

464
00:43:23,667 --> 00:43:25,794
It's gone now.

465
00:43:26,737 --> 00:43:28,830
<i>Commencing orbital burn.</i>

466
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:33,868
Hey, listen up, you guys!
Something's going on.

467
00:44:03,107 --> 00:44:04,972
Scooter, look out!

468
00:44:09,246 --> 00:44:11,714
Whoa, that was close!

469
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:17,317
Houston? We seem to be taking on
a bit more vibration than we expected.

470
00:44:17,388 --> 00:44:19,822
<i>Yeah, we're monitoring that now.</i>

471
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,923
What's going on, IQ?

472
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:29,329
I think we gotta slow down, get into
the moon's orbit before we can land.

473
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:32,961
<i>Better strap in, fellas.</i>
<i>This might get worse before it gets better.</i>

474
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:36,473
We want you to cut back power
by 25 percent.

475
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:40,169
<i>Houston, we don't have a whole lot of
time to make our orbit range for entry.</i>

476
00:44:40,244 --> 00:44:42,178
We know, 25 percent.

477
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,245
Roger.

478
00:44:46,116 --> 00:44:50,416
Houston, we seem to have a small problem.
The engine won't respond.

479
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:56,823
Commander, we've discovered a short
in one of your control panels.

480
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:59,385
It needs to be manually disconnected.

481
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:03,900
<i>Sir, we don't have time to trace a short.</i>
<i>In 30 seconds, we'll have missed our orbit.</i>

482
00:45:03,967 --> 00:45:05,434
It's the only shot we've got.

483
00:45:05,502 --> 00:45:08,528
I knew I smelled smoke!

484
00:45:08,605 --> 00:45:11,836
We gotta do something!

485
00:45:11,909 --> 00:45:14,036
I'm with you!

486
00:45:26,123 --> 00:45:30,082
- What are we looking for?
- A loose wire! A short!

487
00:45:49,213 --> 00:45:54,378
I think I found it! What do we do?

488
00:45:55,519 --> 00:45:57,680
We've gotta put it back in.

489
00:45:59,323 --> 00:46:01,188
Careful! It's too hot.

490
00:46:01,258 --> 00:46:03,783
We need something,
I don't know, anything!

491
00:46:03,861 --> 00:46:05,658
Will this work?

492
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:12,829
Let me help you.

493
00:46:14,104 --> 00:46:16,004
Come on, harder!

494
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:25,511
You did it, Aldrin.

495
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:27,578
I did, didn't I?

496
00:46:28,185 --> 00:46:30,085
Let's get out of here.

497
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:35,057
I love toasted olives.

498
00:46:39,096 --> 00:46:43,533
Apollo 11, <i>you have been cleared</i>
<i>to commence lunar module docking.</i>

499
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:46,033
<i>Roger that, Houston.</i>

500
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:21,829
Come home soon, my little dreamer.

501
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:49,090
<i>Houston, lunar module is</i>
<i>docked and secure.</i>

502
00:47:50,667 --> 00:47:52,567
<i>Good work, Commander.</i>

503
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:06,908
<i>Commander Armstrong,</i>
<i>this is Houston.</i>

504
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:09,782
<i>Are we ready to begin transfer</i>
<i>to the lunar module?</i>

505
00:48:09,853 --> 00:48:12,845
- Ready as can be, Houston.
<i>-You may proceed.</i>

506
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:16,791
This is it, guys.
Time to hitch a ride to the moon!

507
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:35,610
Wow, look at that moon.

508
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:38,947
It's shining like a spoon.

509
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:42,346
This is so cool.

510
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,487
Guys, what's that?

511
00:48:48,792 --> 00:48:53,752
- What's happening?
- We've got to get out of here.

512
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:09,141
Whoa, what was that?

513
00:49:14,551 --> 00:49:17,714
IQ, wake up.

514
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:26,425
Scooter, please wake up.

515
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:31,462
What have I done?

516
00:49:42,346 --> 00:49:43,813
Okay.

517
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:46,678
On the count of three,
we give it everything we've got.

518
00:49:46,750 --> 00:49:47,739
All right?

519
00:49:48,251 --> 00:49:52,278
Ready. One, two, three!

520
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:58,554
Pull! Pull! Pull! Pull!

521
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:04,498
<i>Houston, we are ready to begin
first phase of lunar descent.</i>

522
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:06,764
<i>You may proceed.</i>

523
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:16,278
Scooter! You're alive!

524
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:20,282
What? Of course I'm alive.

525
00:50:20,350 --> 00:50:23,945
- What happened?
- Some kind of numbing spray, I suspect.

526
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:25,579
You're both alive!

527
00:50:25,655 --> 00:50:31,059
Yeah, but for how much longer?
We're stuck in a glass tube.

528
00:50:32,462 --> 00:50:34,896
How are we gonna get out of here?

529
00:50:37,501 --> 00:50:39,435
Wait. Let me help you.

530
00:50:40,504 --> 00:50:42,495
Ready? Push!

531
00:50:45,809 --> 00:50:47,401
It won't move!

532
00:50:48,678 --> 00:50:52,705
You know, IQ, if you'd help us,
maybe we could get this cap off.

533
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:57,113
I have a better idea.
If we all combined our energy mass

534
00:50:57,187 --> 00:50:59,951
and apply it to the tube
from the same intersection,

535
00:51:00,023 --> 00:51:02,116
we might be able to dislodge ourselves,

536
00:51:02,192 --> 00:51:05,559
thereby creating a natural momentum
to carry us over the edge.

537
00:51:05,629 --> 00:51:08,189
- You mean push the tube over and break it?
- Yeah.

538
00:51:08,265 --> 00:51:10,392
Why didn't you just say that?

539
00:51:11,868 --> 00:51:13,392
All together.

540
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:17,400
Come on, harder!

541
00:51:25,148 --> 00:51:26,672
We're doomed.

542
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:31,916
<i>Houston,</i>
<i>we've begun our descent.</i>

543
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:36,015
<i>It seems we are off target</i>
<i>by at least four miles.</i>

544
00:51:36,093 --> 00:51:38,220
<i>Copy that,</i> Apollo 11.

545
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:44,199
<i>It's gonna be a rough landing if we
stay with these coordinates, Houston.</i>

546
00:51:44,267 --> 00:51:46,030
<i>We're going to have to switch over</i>
<i>to manual.</i>

547
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:48,196
<i>Can you bring her down yourself?</i>

548
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:51,138
Roger that, Houston. Let's give it a go.

549
00:52:07,624 --> 00:52:11,651
<i>We're approaching the southwest
edge of the Sea of Tranquility.</i>

550
00:52:14,764 --> 00:52:18,860
Houston, we're experiencing some
communication breakup. Do you copy?

551
00:52:18,935 --> 00:52:21,995
Nine hundred feet,
coming down at 23 degrees.

552
00:52:24,674 --> 00:52:28,337
- Houston, do you copy?
<i>-Stand by,</i> Apollo 11.

553
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:30,643
<i>Eight hundred feet, 21 down.</i>

554
00:52:30,714 --> 00:52:33,581
Apollo 11,
<i>we are assessing the situation.</i>

555
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:38,280
<i>Be prepared for possible abort</i>
<i>on lunar landing. Do you copy?</i>

556
00:52:38,822 --> 00:52:40,187
<i>Copy that.</i>

557
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:47,391
Oh, come on, boys.
Get your butt into it, come on.

558
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,630
<i>Take us surfing</i>

559
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:58,471
<i>Take us surfing</i>

560
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:04,304
<i>We're awaiting word</i>
<i>from mission control in Houston.</i>

561
00:53:04,381 --> 00:53:08,147
<i>Everyone here is engaged</i>
<i>in a tremendous enterprise.</i>

562
00:53:08,218 --> 00:53:10,186
<i>The excitement is palpable.</i>

563
00:53:10,253 --> 00:53:14,485
Apollo 11, <i>we've established the cause</i>
<i>of our communication breakdown.</i>

564
00:53:14,558 --> 00:53:18,824
<i>Due to unanticipated radar data,</i>
<i>we've gotten a bit bottlenecked.</i>

565
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:22,428
<i>We've alleviated the problem.</i>
<i>You are good to go.</i>

566
00:53:22,499 --> 00:53:23,966
Roger that, Houston.

567
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:28,095
Four hundred down and nine.
Still have lots of vibration.

568
00:53:44,588 --> 00:53:46,613
Great. Now, what?

569
00:53:46,690 --> 00:53:50,922
Weightlessness.
Gosh, I didn't think about that!

570
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:55,230
<i>On this incredible occasion,</i>

571
00:53:55,298 --> 00:53:58,461
<i>the world's eyes are on</i>
<i>what is happening in Houston.</i>

572
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:01,930
<i>These adventurers are going to be</i>
<i>performing something</i>

573
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:05,065
<i>which has obviously</i>
<i>never been done before.</i>

574
00:54:05,141 --> 00:54:09,737
Oh, guys, we're about to meet
that energy mass you were talking about.

575
00:54:42,812 --> 00:54:45,178
<i>We've got shadow out here.</i>

576
00:54:45,248 --> 00:54:47,182
<i>Thirty feet,</i>
<i>two and a half down.</i>

577
00:54:48,685 --> 00:54:50,653
<i>Roger that,</i> Apollo 11.

578
00:55:12,142 --> 00:55:15,839
<i>Houston, Tranquility Base.</i>
<i>The Eagle has landed.</i>

579
00:55:21,284 --> 00:55:24,845
- We're on the moon!
- We are on the moon!

580
00:55:25,889 --> 00:55:27,584
Did you hear something?

581
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:34,221
- I thought I did for a moment there.
- Never mind. We did it, Commander.

582
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:39,030
- Nat's on the moon! Nat's on the moon!
- Nat's on the moon! Nat's on the moon!

583
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:41,662
Yes, he is, sweethearts.

584
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:46,003
I'll be. Our boy's on the moon.

585
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:48,507
Hey, you're not fainting!

586
00:55:48,578 --> 00:55:51,843
- No more fainting, Dad.
- That's my girl!

587
00:55:55,051 --> 00:55:59,283
<i>Good work, you guys.</i>
<i>I'll be waiting for you when you get back.</i>

588
00:55:59,356 --> 00:56:01,381
<i>Good work, Commander.</i>

589
00:56:01,458 --> 00:56:04,427
Okay. I guess it's time for me to suit up.

590
00:56:07,564 --> 00:56:10,692
It looks like there's only gonna be
one of them walking on the moon.

591
00:56:10,767 --> 00:56:15,101
Nat, we wouldn't be here
if it weren't for you. You go.

592
00:56:18,742 --> 00:56:23,372
Houston, we're good to go.
<i>We'll support you, Commander.</i>

593
00:57:32,248 --> 00:57:34,716
<i>I'm at the foot of the ladder.</i>

594
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:39,050
<i>The lunar module footpads</i>
<i>are only depressed in the surface</i>

595
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:42,614
<i>about one or two inches.</i>

596
00:57:43,426 --> 00:57:47,760
<i>The surface appears to be</i>
<i>very, very fine grain.</i>

597
00:57:48,932 --> 00:57:52,800
<i>As you get close to it,</i>
<i>it's almost like powder.</i>

598
00:58:12,856 --> 00:58:15,484
<i>That's one small step for man,</i>

599
00:58:17,260 --> 00:58:19,728
<i>one giant leap for mankind.</i>

600
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:32,433
I can't believe it. I'm on the moon!

601
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,198
Well, I'll be.

602
00:59:35,271 --> 00:59:37,899
<i>What was that, Commander?</i>
<i>Didn't copy.</i>

603
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:40,943
<i>Nothing, Houston.</i>
<i>Just talking to myself.</i>

604
01:00:35,898 --> 01:00:39,595
Look at the Americans!
They are walking on the moon!

605
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:41,636
This is fantastic.

606
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:45,162
You idiot! Idiot! Idiot!

607
01:00:45,508 --> 01:00:47,271
Where is Nadia?

608
01:00:49,212 --> 01:00:52,579
I have not seen her
for several days, Comrade.

609
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,139
How strange.

610
01:00:58,588 --> 01:01:01,648
Come in! The door's open!

611
01:01:02,525 --> 01:01:07,656
Hello, my name is Nadia. I come to America.

612
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:10,327
Oh, my lord of the flies!

613
01:01:11,634 --> 01:01:13,226
Maggots!

614
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:14,963
Come in, come in.

615
01:01:16,739 --> 01:01:20,835
Children very crazy, no?

616
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:26,744
- What's all the commotion? I was...
- Hello, Amos.

617
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:30,484
Nadia! Why are you...

618
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:34,317
How did you get here, let alone find me?

619
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:38,426
Darling, it too long time
for many questions.

620
01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:43,424
- You have beautiful wife and...
- No. I'm his daughter.

621
01:01:45,735 --> 01:01:49,899
Your grandson, he in big, big danger.

622
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:53,074
- What? My Nat?
- Yes. I tell you.

623
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:59,411
Many flies in my country
very angry about moon mission.

624
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:04,386
They not stop. They want to make sure
your son and friends do not come home.

625
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:06,786
Ain't nobody gonna hurt Nat.

626
01:02:06,856 --> 01:02:11,190
Russian operative
inside your command center here.

627
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:15,253
- He must be stopped!
- Who is this Russian operative?

628
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:19,893
His name is Yegor.
He have bad scar on face,

629
01:02:20,336 --> 01:02:23,635
twitch like locomotive
down slippery slope.

630
01:02:23,706 --> 01:02:26,641
- Dad, what are you doing?
- No need to worry about me.

631
01:02:26,709 --> 01:02:30,839
The Russians have got to be stopped.
I'll bring our boys home.

632
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:34,076
Amos, be careful.

633
01:02:53,336 --> 01:02:56,828
<i>Houston, we are preparing</i>
<i>for departure and re-docking.</i>

634
01:02:57,774 --> 01:02:59,765
<i>Copy that,</i> Apollo 11.

635
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:09,679
Hey, any of you guys hungry?

636
01:03:29,005 --> 01:03:32,133
Apollo 11, <i>you have been cleared</i>
<i>to commence pre-checklist</i>

637
01:03:32,208 --> 01:03:35,644
<i>- for lunar module docking.</i>
<i>- Roger that, Houston.</i>

638
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:50,350
<i>Houston,</i>
<i>we have left the moon.</i>

639
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:52,894
<i>Copy that,</i> Apollo 11.

640
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:00,864
Where's Scooter? Scooter?

641
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:05,502
Hey, what's going on? Where are we?

642
01:04:25,728 --> 01:04:26,820
Wow.

643
01:05:02,498 --> 01:05:06,093
<i>Houston, we are leveling out</i>
<i>in our orbital pattern.</i>

644
01:05:06,502 --> 01:05:08,163
<i>Job well done, men.</i>

645
01:05:34,964 --> 01:05:37,933
It's too small. Help me.

646
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:43,400
Everything is in place.

647
01:05:43,472 --> 01:05:47,238
Yegor handle diversion
when re-entry begin.

648
01:05:47,310 --> 01:05:51,508
We move into action,
reset new landing coordinates.

649
01:05:51,580 --> 01:05:55,277
Ah, not worry, Comrade. I not fail you.

650
01:05:55,351 --> 01:05:59,811
Make sure you don't.
Go! Do not arouse suspicion.

651
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:04,391
Too much.

652
01:06:05,628 --> 01:06:08,620
<i>Commencing to re-dock.</i>

653
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:18,306
<i>Houston, lunar module</i>
<i>is docked and secure.</i>

654
01:06:20,543 --> 01:06:23,569
Houston, we are moving back
to the command module.

655
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:43,363
Houston, we are commencing
lunar module disengagement phase.

656
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:44,865
Scooter!

657
01:06:46,068 --> 01:06:47,092
Where is he?

658
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:48,727
We're back in the command module.

659
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:52,130
- What?
- Oh, no!

660
01:06:52,208 --> 01:06:54,267
Scooter's going to be left behind!

661
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:58,074
He's still in the lunar module.
We have to get him out!

662
01:06:58,147 --> 01:07:02,777
- I'm going in after him.
- No, wait! Nat!

663
01:07:05,021 --> 01:07:09,219
Commencing lunar module
disengage in 15 seconds.

664
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:20,631
Hey, Nat. Where have you been?

665
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:22,432
They're gonna disconnect
this part of the ship

666
01:07:22,505 --> 01:07:24,871
- from the command module.
- Cool!

667
01:07:24,940 --> 01:07:26,430
No! Not cool.

668
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:30,172
If we don't get out of here,
we'll be left behind in space!

669
01:07:33,749 --> 01:07:38,118
- Hurry, Scooter, hurry!
- I'm stuck! I can't move!

670
01:07:38,454 --> 01:07:41,821
Come on, Scooter. Come on! You can do it!

671
01:07:46,028 --> 01:07:48,360
Suck in your belly! That should do it!

672
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,967
Disengaging lunar module.

673
01:07:54,036 --> 01:07:55,731
Guys?

674
01:08:10,453 --> 01:08:14,219
Guys. This is terrible.

675
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:17,692
I should have done something.

676
01:08:18,961 --> 01:08:21,589
Hey, IQ? You want some?

677
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:25,226
Scooter! You're alive!

678
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:27,269
I should kill you.

679
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:30,635
You and your compulsive eating!
You almost got us killed!

680
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:34,867
Scooter, you really gotta go on a diet.

681
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:39,837
I promise. I promise I will. Guys?

682
01:08:43,686 --> 01:08:47,520
- They are American flies, after all.
- Sure, why not.

683
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:50,652
What was that all about?

684
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:53,588
I don't know, but we're going home.

685
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:04,596
All right, you two.
Time to prove you got what it takes.

686
01:09:04,707 --> 01:09:07,801
I heard the stories
about your big adventures.

687
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:13,238
Maybe you did, and maybe you didn't,
but this is the real McCoy.

688
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:16,543
We gotta stop these Russians
from hurting our boys.

689
01:09:16,619 --> 01:09:21,454
I want you to get in there and find them.
We'll be right behind you. Right, boys?

690
01:09:21,557 --> 01:09:24,890
Right! We won't fail you, Grandpa.

691
01:09:24,994 --> 01:09:29,897
All right, boys, stretch out.
Don't wanna pull anything.

692
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:41,903
<i>Houston, we are on course.</i>
<i>The Earth's gravity has taken over,</i>

693
01:09:41,977 --> 01:09:46,141
<i>and we are beginning</i>
<i>to be pulled homeward.</i>

694
01:09:46,215 --> 01:09:50,618
Alert, Yegor,
it is time to change re-entry coordinates.

695
01:09:52,288 --> 01:09:56,224
<i>Babushka,</i> how we feel now? Better?

696
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:02,260
Much better. I thought I was over
these fainting episodes.

697
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:05,767
Nadia, look. I don't do this sort of thing,
be brave and all, I mean,

698
01:10:05,834 --> 01:10:08,826
but I'm not gonna just sit here
while my son is flying home

699
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:10,838
to lord of the flies knows what!

700
01:10:10,906 --> 01:10:15,775
Boys? Lick your faces.
It's time to rock and roll!

701
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:17,568
Yeah!

702
01:10:17,646 --> 01:10:21,013
Okay. We rocks and rolls.

703
01:10:23,619 --> 01:10:28,886
I bet when we get back, they'll throw us
a big party with lots of food.

704
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,152
Scooter!

705
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:33,457
Not that I'm eating anything
with my new diet.

706
01:10:34,863 --> 01:10:37,263
<i>Houston, we've made our</i>
<i>mid-course corrections</i>

707
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:40,825
<i>and have readjusted the flight path</i>
<i>of the spacecraft.</i>

708
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:44,999
<i>Roger that. We'll switch over</i>
<i>to computer coordinates for re-entry.</i>

709
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:50,774
Americans think they can beat us.
They better think again.

710
01:10:50,846 --> 01:10:54,282
Mother Russia is strong!

711
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:48,393
Hey, you're that Russian, aren't you?

712
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:52,065
Russian? What are you talking about?

713
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:56,170
- I made a wrong turn.
- He's trying to trick us!

714
01:11:56,245 --> 01:11:58,839
Butch, he's got the scar.

715
01:11:59,114 --> 01:12:03,073
Scar? It's a birthmark.

716
01:12:03,152 --> 01:12:04,710
Don't move!

717
01:12:05,387 --> 01:12:08,220
And what do you plan on doing?

718
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:12,354
Ever wanted to be a firefly?

719
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:44,583
He's getting away!

720
01:12:44,660 --> 01:12:50,599
So long, losers!
Americans too slow for us Russians.

721
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:52,463
Not so fast!

722
01:13:03,112 --> 01:13:07,276
They send a bunch of old flies after me?

723
01:13:07,349 --> 01:13:10,341
I will make quick work of all of you.

724
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:13,418
Is that right?

725
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:16,049
I'm all you're gonna be able to handle.

726
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:18,150
Bring it on, Grandpa!

727
01:13:18,227 --> 01:13:20,889
All right, Grandpa! You got him!

728
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:29,135
That's it, Grandpa.
Keep moving, keep dancing.

729
01:13:29,204 --> 01:13:30,899
Yeah, get him!

730
01:13:31,907 --> 01:13:34,603
All right, Grandpa!
Give him the old one-two!

731
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:37,644
Wow. That had to hurt.

732
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:42,575
You got him! You got him!

733
01:13:49,992 --> 01:13:53,223
Come on, Grandpa! Work those wings!

734
01:14:01,036 --> 01:14:02,765
Hey, that's cheating!

735
01:14:02,838 --> 01:14:05,898
Everything fair in war and love.

736
01:14:05,974 --> 01:14:09,034
Isn't what you silly Americans say?

737
01:14:16,752 --> 01:14:19,118
Yeah, get him, Grandpa!

738
01:15:09,605 --> 01:15:13,564
- Yeah! She rocks!
- Awesome!

739
01:15:15,043 --> 01:15:18,843
You act like big fly?
You little fly, darling.

740
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:21,482
Little, nothing fly.

741
01:15:21,550 --> 01:15:28,114
Nadia, don't. They have washed brain.
You confused.

742
01:15:28,657 --> 01:15:33,560
No, no wash brain. I get smart.

743
01:15:35,030 --> 01:15:38,124
- My kind of woman!
- You okay, Amos?

744
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:41,667
Fit as a fiddle.
That's some kick you got there.

745
01:15:41,737 --> 01:15:44,205
Yeah. I got big foot.

746
01:15:44,473 --> 01:15:49,672
What take Yegor so long?
He must set diversion off now.

747
01:15:49,745 --> 01:15:53,306
Maybe something wrong?
We proceed anyway.

748
01:15:53,782 --> 01:15:55,682
- Not so fast!
- Not so fast!

749
01:15:56,718 --> 01:16:00,119
What this? Some kind of joke?

750
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:02,690
- Boys?
- Yeah, Mom!

751
01:16:05,093 --> 01:16:08,290
Prepare your butts to be kicked!

752
01:16:19,641 --> 01:16:22,474
- Good one!
- It was no joke.

753
01:16:22,544 --> 01:16:25,308
Gonna hurt my boys, huh?

754
01:16:36,491 --> 01:16:39,949
<i>Standing by, Houston.</i>
<i>We are moments from splashdown.</i>

755
01:16:40,596 --> 01:16:42,223
<i>Copy that, Commander.</i>

756
01:16:42,297 --> 01:16:44,925
<i>We've begun live TV transmission</i>
<i>down here.</i>

757
01:18:13,455 --> 01:18:16,947
No! How happen this to me?

758
01:18:17,626 --> 01:18:20,117
I'm finished! Kaput!

759
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:24,298
What you do now? Join circus clowns?

760
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:26,732
No, I move to Miami Beach.

761
01:18:26,802 --> 01:18:30,169
New groovy club need
waiters with foreign accents.

762
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:33,230
- What?
- Don't swat me, please.

763
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:38,437
You think groovy club need two waiters?

764
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:44,776
Give me some skin, Comrade.

765
01:18:45,287 --> 01:18:47,448
Maybe too groovy.

766
01:19:15,150 --> 01:19:16,879
Welcome home!

767
01:19:29,197 --> 01:19:32,758
Hey, guys, something big
must have happened while we were gone.

768
01:19:34,136 --> 01:19:36,263
- Scooter!
- What?

769
01:19:46,715 --> 01:19:49,616
- It's all my fault.
- It's my fault, too.

770
01:19:49,684 --> 01:19:52,380
- I wanted to go to the moon.
- Me, too.

771
01:19:52,821 --> 01:19:56,757
Well, actually, I didn't,
but when I got there, it was so cool!

772
01:20:05,734 --> 01:20:07,531
I love you, Mom.

773
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:25,810
Sorry you didn't get your chance
to go to the moon, Grandpa.

774
01:20:26,454 --> 01:20:28,445
Don't you worry about me.

775
01:20:28,523 --> 01:20:31,822
I got lots more adventure
under these old wings.

776
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:36,392
- I love you, Grandpa.
- Not more than I love you.

777
01:20:40,202 --> 01:20:43,899
I ever tell you about the time
I flew with Amelia Earhart?

778
01:20:44,706 --> 01:20:47,174
Only about a million times!

779
01:20:47,676 --> 01:20:50,736
Wanna hear it a million and one?

780
01:20:50,812 --> 01:20:53,303
Sure, I love that story, Grandpa.

781
01:20:53,815 --> 01:20:58,115
We were about 10 hours into it,
out over the Atlantic Ocean...

782
01:21:01,890 --> 01:21:05,587
<i>Hold on! Hold the credits!</i>
<i>Stop the credits!</i>

783
01:21:07,929 --> 01:21:14,266
Hello, I'm Buzz Aldrin. The original Buzz
and lunar module pilot on <i>Apollo 11.</i>

784
01:21:14,769 --> 01:21:18,865
My friends here at the Space Program
asked me to speak to you today

785
01:21:19,407 --> 01:21:21,841
to set the record straight.

786
01:21:21,910 --> 01:21:26,404
No matter what you may have heard
or thought you have seen,

787
01:21:27,182 --> 01:21:33,815
there were no contaminants, no flies,
on the <i>Apollo 11.</i>

788
01:21:34,122 --> 01:21:37,683
It is, in fact, a scientific impossibility.

789
01:21:38,960 --> 01:21:41,895
Now that we've straightened that out,

790
01:21:41,963 --> 01:21:46,332
I want to salute all the men and women
who have toiled,

791
01:21:46,468 --> 01:21:51,565
<i>before and after that first moon mission,</i>
<i>in pursuit of new frontiers.</i>

792
01:21:53,008 --> 01:21:56,671
<i>Let us always continue</i>
<i>to reach for the stars.</i>

793
01:21:57,212 --> 01:22:00,238
<i>What was that all about?</i>
<i>Beats me.</i>

794
01:22:00,315 --> 01:22:04,445
<i>- Adventure forever!</i>
<i>- All right!</i>

795
01:22:15,163 --> 01:22:16,858
<i>Fly me to the moon</i>

796
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:21,733
<i>And let me play among the stars</i>

797
01:22:21,803 --> 01:22:25,034
<i>Let me see what spring is like</i>

798
01:22:25,106 --> 01:22:29,543
<i>On Jupiter and Mars</i>

799
01:22:29,611 --> 01:22:31,909
<i>In other words</i>

800
01:22:31,980 --> 01:22:37,111
<i>Hold my hand</i>

801
01:22:37,185 --> 01:22:40,086
<i>In other words</i>

802
01:22:40,155 --> 01:22:44,751
<i>Darling, kiss me</i>

803
01:22:44,826 --> 01:22:51,561
<i>Fly me to the moon</i>

804
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:57,805
<i>In other words</i>

805
01:22:57,872 --> 01:23:01,968
<i>Please be true</i>
