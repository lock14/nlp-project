5
00:01:18,387 --> 00:01:19,876
<i>And it wouldn't be our last.</i>

6
00:01:23,459 --> 00:01:24,948

14
00:01:45,746 --> 00:01:47,737
Come on, private!

35
00:02:48,644 --> 00:02:50,076
Who's this?

36
00:02:52,447 --> 00:02:54,074
Officer Bleichert,

37
00:02:55,082 --> 00:02:57,210
meet <i>Se√±or</i> Tomas Dos Santos.

38
00:02:57,352 --> 00:03:00,616
You came all the way
down here just to roust
some Class B felon?

39
00:03:00,688 --> 00:03:03,885
Came down here, same as you,
to keep from getting killed.

40
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:06,927
Happened to see some jarheads
beating on a good collar.

41
00:03:06,995 --> 00:03:08,586
I'll take him in the morning.
This is nuts.

42
00:03:08,663 --> 00:03:10,996
We'll never get him
booked tonight.

43
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:15,064
That's a nice left hook
you got.

44
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,230
Mmm.

45
00:03:17,673 --> 00:03:19,264
Well, you know, old habits.

46
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:20,966
Yeah.

47
00:03:21,543 --> 00:03:25,034
My girlfriend saw you fight
a couple of times
over at the Olympic.

48
00:03:25,112 --> 00:03:28,014
Said you were good.
Said you were somebody.

49
00:03:32,687 --> 00:03:34,485
Big fish, small pond.

50
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:37,558
Never made it up to the
big boys' division like you.

51
00:03:37,626 --> 00:03:40,116
My first 20 fights
were stumblebums

52
00:03:40,695 --> 00:03:42,526
handpicked by my manager.

53
00:03:42,598 --> 00:03:44,224
Lucky to survive.

54
00:03:45,234 --> 00:03:47,668
There's a Jew-boy Deputy D.A.
over in Central Warrants,

55
00:03:47,735 --> 00:03:49,168
wets his pants for fighters,

56
00:03:49,237 --> 00:03:51,638
and he promised me
the next spot he can wangle.

57
00:03:52,873 --> 00:03:55,103
<i>Warrants was</i>
<i>local celebrity as a cop.</i>

58
00:03:55,176 --> 00:03:56,973

00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:01,437

Bleichert.

61
00:04:01,515 --> 00:04:04,144

66
00:04:12,026 --> 00:04:13,756
Bucky,
this is Chief Ted Green.

67
00:04:13,829 --> 00:04:14,818
Nice to meet you.

68
00:04:14,896 --> 00:04:17,262
Deputy District Attorney
Ellis Loew.

69
00:04:18,766 --> 00:04:20,199
Read that out loud, Dwight.

70
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:22,168
That's running
in the <i>Sunday Times</i>.

71
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:24,637
"Before the war,

What do you think?

88
00:05:06,648 --> 00:05:07,672
Subtle.

89
00:05:07,749 --> 00:05:08,773
Prop B's a loser right now,

90
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,214
but I think if we can
drum up some publicity

91
00:05:10,285 --> 00:05:12,845
we can get it passed

Yes, sir.
Fire and Ice.

all gate to charity.

95

After that, we bring back
the boxing team.

96

What do you say, Bucky?
You in?

97
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,122
I got to
get back in shape.

98
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,257
Bucky.

99
00:05:25,334 --> 00:05:26,528
Lee.

100
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,228
I'd like you to meet Kay Lake.

101
00:05:28,302 --> 00:05:30,202
Hello.
Hello.

102
00:05:30,271 --> 00:05:31,500
You beefing up?

103
00:05:31,572 --> 00:05:32,834
You know.

104
00:05:32,908 --> 00:05:35,307
I was just telling Kay here
about our new hobby.

105
00:05:35,377 --> 00:05:36,605
Are you a fight fan,
Miss Lake?

106
00:05:36,677 --> 00:05:38,235
No, Lee used to drag me.

107
00:05:38,312 --> 00:05:40,678
I was taking art classes,
so I'd sketch.

108
00:05:40,749 --> 00:05:42,079
She made me quit fighting
the smokers.

109
00:05:42,149 --> 00:05:43,707
Didn't want me doing
the "Vegetable Shuffle."

110
00:05:43,784 --> 00:05:45,615
I promise not to hurt you.

111
00:05:45,687 --> 00:05:47,278
That won't make Loew
very happy.

112
00:05:47,355 --> 00:05:48,846
Oh, he's got money on me?

113
00:05:48,923 --> 00:05:51,721
Seems that way.
You win, you get Warrants.

114
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,356
What's in it for you?

115
00:05:53,427 --> 00:05:55,588
Well, betting works both ways.

116
00:05:55,663 --> 00:05:57,062
My girl's got a taste
for nice things

117
00:05:57,132 --> 00:05:59,531
and I can't afford to
let her down.

118
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,726
Right, babe?

119
00:06:00,802 --> 00:06:02,826
Keep talking about me
in third person.

120
00:06:02,903 --> 00:06:04,302
It sends me.

121
00:06:04,605 --> 00:06:06,266
What do you think of all this,
Miss Lake?

122
00:06:06,341 --> 00:06:10,675
Well, for civic reasons,
I hope the LAPD is ridiculed
for perpetrating this farce.

123
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:13,180
For personal reasons,
I hope Lee wins.

124
00:06:13,247 --> 00:06:16,115
And, for esthetic reasons,
I hope you both look good
with your shirts off.

125
00:06:35,403 --> 00:06:36,495
Papa?

126
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,014
<i>Guten Tag</i>, Dwight.

128
00:07:06,668 --> 00:07:09,466
Hey, you haven't finished
this plane yet.

129
00:07:10,204 --> 00:07:11,968
Can you finish that?

130
00:07:14,141 --> 00:07:15,665
Here, sit down.

131
00:07:23,918 --> 00:07:25,613
If you could just come by
and clean the place up,

132
00:07:25,687 --> 00:07:27,882
keep an eye on him
for a week or so.

133
00:07:30,692 --> 00:07:32,158
I know I still owe you.

134
00:07:35,963 --> 00:07:38,057
Guess what I hear is right.

135
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:40,459
You'll want to place this
with Mickey Cohen's indie.

136
00:07:40,534 --> 00:07:42,264
He's got Blanchard, 2-1.

137
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:45,802
That confident, huh?

138
00:07:46,875 --> 00:07:48,774
You done your homework?

139
00:07:50,177 --> 00:07:52,305
Yeah. I've done my homework.

140
00:07:57,786 --> 00:07:59,913
I'm not betting on me, Pete.

141
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:04,048
Blanchard's the hero here.

142
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:05,992
That's the way
the story's supposed to go.

143
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,425
I'm just the other guy.

144
00:08:16,737 --> 00:08:19,103
Well, at least he looks good
with his shirt off.

145
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,110
Where's your sketchpad?

146
00:08:25,312 --> 00:08:26,677
I was never any good.

147
00:08:26,747 --> 00:08:29,079
Ended up with a Master's
in History.

148
00:08:30,151 --> 00:08:31,913
Education's
an expensive habit.

149
00:08:32,988 --> 00:08:34,580
Lee paid for it.

150
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,657
He shouldn't have
quit fighting.

151
00:08:36,725 --> 00:08:38,283
I asked him to.

152
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,453
Besides, police work
gives him a sense of order.

153
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:46,631
Do you have a girlfriend,
Dwight?

154
00:08:47,168 --> 00:08:49,692
I'm saving myself
for Rita Hayworth.

155
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:57,340
So he quits
fighting for you,
puts you through school.

156
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,744
Quite a guy. Quite a pair.

157
00:08:59,947 --> 00:09:01,847
Why aren't you married?

158
00:09:05,153 --> 00:09:07,313
You know,
shacking's against regs.
Probably cost him a stripe.

159
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:10,187
So where's the diamonds
and the bassinets, huh?

160
00:09:12,126 --> 00:09:14,687
Well, you'd have
to sleep together
for that, Dwight.

161
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:29,642
<i>The gym was packed</i>
<i>to the rafters.</i>

162
00:09:30,511 --> 00:09:33,345
<i>A wild crowd hungry</i>

163
00:09:35,149 --> 00:09:37,243

164

00:09:42,990 --> 00:09:44,457
Luck, Dwight.

167
00:09:46,027 --> 00:09:47,789
Come on.

168
00:09:59,106 --> 00:10:00,630
Keep it clean!

00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,854
Four!

175
00:10:54,596 --> 00:10:55,687
Five!

176
00:10:58,198 --> 00:10:59,256
Six!

177
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:01,095
<i>I lost a lot of things</i>
<i>in life...</i>

178
00:11:01,168 --> 00:11:02,500
Seven!

179
00:11:03,837 --> 00:11:05,395
<i>...but never</i>
<i>a fight for money.</i>

180
00:11:05,472 --> 00:11:06,667
Eight!

181
00:11:22,856 --> 00:11:26,384
<i>I was trading Warrants</i>
<i>for a close-out on old</i>
<i>bad debts.</i>

182
00:11:27,028 --> 00:11:28,393
<i>The eight grand</i>
<i>I was going to clear</i>

183
00:11:28,462 --> 00:11:29,691
<i>was enough</i>
<i>to maintain the old man</i>

184
00:11:29,764 --> 00:11:32,664
<i>in a good, clean rest home</i>
<i>for three years.</i>

185
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,163
<i>The late-round tank job,</i>

186
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:36,361
<i>enough to convince myself</i>
<i>I wasn't a complete coward.</i>

187
00:11:37,504 --> 00:11:38,562
Box!

188
00:11:44,144 --> 00:11:45,772
Finish the fight!

189
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,942
Where's that hook?

190
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,365
You're out!

191
00:12:58,653 --> 00:13:00,245
Give me a smile.

192
00:13:11,865 --> 00:13:13,890
It's nice, isn't it, Papa?

193
00:13:14,501 --> 00:13:16,163
What do you think?

194
00:13:35,956 --> 00:13:37,652
Hey! Canvasback!

195
00:13:44,865 --> 00:13:46,230
Canvasback!

196
00:13:52,841 --> 00:13:55,571
You going to hide in there
another week?

197
00:13:55,777 --> 00:13:57,539
Ain't you bored yet?

198
00:13:58,178 --> 00:13:59,668
Nice chompers.

199
00:14:00,148 --> 00:14:01,842
So, you want to work Warrants?

200
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,576
I lost.
What about Loew's deal?

201
00:14:03,650 --> 00:14:07,018
Don't you read the papers?
The bond passed yesterday.

202
00:14:07,855 --> 00:14:09,083
You want the job?

203
00:14:10,825 --> 00:14:12,553
Atta boy, Mr. Ice.

204
00:14:13,995 --> 00:14:15,154
Champ!

205
00:14:16,096 --> 00:14:17,758
Show them what's
under the lip, boss.

206
00:14:17,831 --> 00:14:19,423
Right over here.

207
00:14:19,967 --> 00:14:23,267
Officer Bleichert,
the men of Central Dicks.

208
00:14:23,705 --> 00:14:27,731
Homicide,
Ad Vice, Bunco, et cetera.
I'm Captain John Tierney.

209
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,134
You and Lee
are the white men of the hour,

210
00:14:30,211 --> 00:14:32,110
so I hope
you enjoyed your ovation.

211
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:34,205
You won't get another one
till you retire.

212
00:14:35,850 --> 00:14:38,010
Enough horse shit!
Listen!

213
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,110
This is the felony
summary report

214
00:14:40,187 --> 00:14:43,248
for the week ending
November 14, 1946.

215
00:14:43,323 --> 00:14:45,655
First, two liquor store
stickups

216
00:14:45,894 --> 00:14:49,192
Broadway and Seventh,
and Hill Liquor in Chinatown.

217
00:14:49,463 --> 00:14:51,125
That one comes
with a pistol whipping,

218
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:53,130
my personal favorite.

219
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:54,793
Russ Millard, Homicides.

220
00:14:54,869 --> 00:14:56,563
Hi.
How are you?

221
00:14:56,638 --> 00:14:58,538
My wife and kids thank you
for the raise, Officer.

222
00:14:58,605 --> 00:15:01,336
Officer Bleichert,
I'm Bill Koenig.
This is Fritz Vogel.

223
00:15:01,408 --> 00:15:03,639
Welcome aboard.
Pleasure to meet you.

224
00:15:05,178 --> 00:15:07,976
Lee, I heard something
you ought to know.

225
00:15:08,048 --> 00:15:11,883
I was over at County Parole,
and Bobby DeWitt got
an "A" number.

226
00:15:11,952 --> 00:15:14,182
He'll be released to L.A.
in late January.

227
00:15:14,254 --> 00:15:15,721
Thanks, Russ.

228
00:15:19,326 --> 00:15:20,658
Who's Bobby DeWitt?

229
00:15:20,727 --> 00:15:21,990
Old beef.

230
00:15:22,429 --> 00:15:24,091
Pot roast tonight?

231
00:15:36,744 --> 00:15:38,438
Don't say anything
about DeWitt.

232
00:15:38,513 --> 00:15:39,844
It'll upset Kay.

233
00:15:40,548 --> 00:15:41,639
Sure.

234
00:15:49,456 --> 00:15:50,822
Nice place.

235
00:15:50,892 --> 00:15:52,290
Fight stash.

236
00:15:53,594 --> 00:15:54,754
Hello.

237
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:57,126
Dwight.
Glad you could make it.

238
00:15:58,966 --> 00:16:00,934
How was your first day?

239
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:05,336
Mostly backslaps and paperwork
if I know those boys.

240
00:16:08,076 --> 00:16:10,168
And look at that smile now.

241
00:16:20,955 --> 00:16:23,149
Well, this is nice,
isn't it?

242
00:16:24,392 --> 00:16:25,450
What?

243
00:16:25,525 --> 00:16:27,221
You and Lee partners.
It's nice.

244
00:16:27,294 --> 00:16:30,423
It couldn't have worked out
better if you'd planned it,
could it, Dwight?

245
00:16:30,498 --> 00:16:31,759
Well, I could've beat him.

246
00:16:31,832 --> 00:16:33,299
Except you didn't.

247
00:16:33,368 --> 00:16:36,894
I don't know, sweetheart.
Bucky was somebody
back in the day.

248
00:16:36,971 --> 00:16:38,096
And here we all are...

249
00:16:38,172 --> 00:16:39,503
It's nice.

250
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:40,934
It's more than nice.

251
00:16:41,009 --> 00:16:44,466
Might even be worth those
front teeth of yours, Dwight.

252
00:16:45,245 --> 00:16:46,440
A toast

253
00:16:47,414 --> 00:16:48,472
to Proposition B.

254
00:16:48,548 --> 00:16:50,210
To the Bleichert-Blanchard
rematch,

255
00:16:50,283 --> 00:16:51,841
bigger than
Louis-Schmeling.

256
00:16:51,918 --> 00:16:54,216
To my supercops!

257
00:16:54,588 --> 00:16:55,681
To us!

258
00:16:59,394 --> 00:17:00,759
<i>From November</i>
<i>through the New Year,</i>

259
00:17:00,827 --> 00:17:03,352
<i>Lee and I captured</i>
<i>11 hard felons,</i>

260
00:17:03,431 --> 00:17:07,390
<i>18 traffic warrantees</i>
<i>and three parole</i>
<i>and probation absconders.</i>

261
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:13,431
<i>After tours of duty,</i>
<i>Lee and I would go</i>
<i>to the house and find Kay.</i>

262
00:17:14,142 --> 00:17:15,972
<i>Sometimes she'd make</i>
<i>dinner for us.</i>

263
00:17:16,044 --> 00:17:19,570
<i>Other times, the three of us</i>
<i>would go out on the town.</i>

264
00:17:40,867 --> 00:17:42,664
<i>Always she'd be there</i>

265
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:45,566
<i>never between us,</i>
<i>always in the middle.</i>

266
00:18:41,362 --> 00:18:42,795
<i>For New Year's,</i>
<i>we headed downtown</i>

267
00:18:42,864 --> 00:18:45,094
<i>to a dinner club</i>
<i>owned by Morrie Friedman,</i>

268
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,898
<i>a friend of Mickey Cohen's</i>

269
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:49,363
<i>who sometimes clued</i>
<i>Lee in to L.A. drug traffic.</i>

270
00:18:49,436 --> 00:18:52,030
Happy New Year!

271
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,893
<i>It was the best time</i>
<i>of my life.</i>

272
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,356
Listen up!
Gentlemen, thank you.

273
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,992
"Raymond 'Junior' Nash.

274
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:50,997
"Statutory rape,
armed robbery, felony mayhem.

275
00:19:51,598 --> 00:19:54,567
"Texas State Prison.
Alcatraz."

276
00:19:54,902 --> 00:19:56,699
Mr. Nash pistol-whipped
a little old lady

277
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,864
at a stickup near
Leimert Park,
Tuesday morning.

278
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,167
She died last night.

279
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,798
Anything common
in the sex beefs?

280
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:03,740
Negro girls. Young ones.

281
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:06,644
All the complainants
have been coloreds.

282
00:20:06,846 --> 00:20:09,041
<i>Junior Nash</i>
<i>was an inbred Okie shit-kicker</i>

283
00:20:09,115 --> 00:20:11,584
<i>who came west and took</i>
<i>all us locals for easy marks</i>

284
00:20:11,652 --> 00:20:14,746
<i>just because</i>
<i>we prefer our cowboys</i>
<i>to look like Gene Autry.</i>

285
00:20:14,821 --> 00:20:16,449
<i>Of course, I didn't care</i>
<i>if he was a hard man</i>

286
00:20:16,523 --> 00:20:18,252
<i>or what he thought</i>
<i>about anything.</i>

287
00:20:18,326 --> 00:20:21,295
<i>He raped children and beat</i>
<i>senior citizens to death.</i>

288
00:20:21,429 --> 00:20:24,364
<i>He was a coward</i>
<i>and I wanted to put him down.</i>

289
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:29,262
I got a tip for the hophead
who's going to be at Norton
and Coliseum tonight.

290
00:20:30,003 --> 00:20:31,163
Hey, partner,
everything good to go?

291
00:20:31,239 --> 00:20:32,262
Yeah.

292
00:20:32,339 --> 00:20:35,570
Nash just got a fuck pad
on Norton and Coliseum.

293
00:21:10,711 --> 00:21:12,372
Scram! Get out of here!

294
00:21:12,445 --> 00:21:13,673
Okay!

295
00:21:13,748 --> 00:21:14,839
Fine.

296
00:21:16,683 --> 00:21:18,810
Don't make me say it twice!
All right! We're going!

297
00:21:18,885 --> 00:21:20,375
Make some money, man.

298
00:21:39,573 --> 00:21:43,474
Oh, my! Oh, help!
Help me! Help, somebody!

299
00:21:43,544 --> 00:21:46,637
Please! Help!
Stop! Stop the car!

300
00:21:46,713 --> 00:21:50,308
Please stop! Stop! Stop!

301
00:22:04,397 --> 00:22:06,730
Listen. I'm broke.

302
00:22:07,768 --> 00:22:09,759
Baby,
he's gonna cut us
a real good deal on this.

303
00:22:09,836 --> 00:22:11,667
I have been knowing him
for a long time.

304
00:22:11,739 --> 00:22:13,673
You ain't got to worry
about a thing, okay?

305
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,209
You ain't got to worry.
I got this dirty cop.

306
00:22:16,277 --> 00:22:17,471
Mmm-hmm.

307
00:22:17,845 --> 00:22:19,607
He's going to
take care of me real soon.

308
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:20,703
And I mean real soon.

309
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,145
Dirty cop?

310
00:22:23,049 --> 00:22:25,678
I haven't heard
of a clean cop, Baxter.

311
00:22:25,752 --> 00:22:27,721
I just want to go home.
Why do you do this to me, huh?

312
00:22:27,788 --> 00:22:29,653
Why? Why this? Why? Why?

313
00:22:29,723 --> 00:22:32,453
Same reason
why you do this to me.
You know why I do this to you.

314
00:22:32,526 --> 00:22:34,824
Where is this guy?
He's right there.
We almost there. Come on.

315
00:22:34,894 --> 00:22:36,452
Come on, baby! Come on.

316
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:37,894
Oh, God,
I got to follow you now?

317
00:22:37,964 --> 00:22:39,432
Come on.

318
00:22:40,601 --> 00:22:42,898
Listen, this is the last time.

319
00:22:43,104 --> 00:22:44,627
Bucky, wake up.

320
00:22:52,512 --> 00:22:54,845
Bucky, look out! Get down!

321
00:22:55,583 --> 00:22:59,211
<i>I was half-asleep,</i>
<i>but Lee had his boxer's wits</i>
<i>about him.</i>

322
00:23:00,221 --> 00:23:02,211
<i>He felt the blow coming.</i>

323
00:23:03,557 --> 00:23:05,218
<i>He saved my life.</i>

324
00:23:30,049 --> 00:23:32,279
Get your motherfucking
hands off me, man.
I ain't done nothing!

325
00:23:32,353 --> 00:23:34,480
Yeah, what do you call that
shooting gallery back there?

326
00:23:38,893 --> 00:23:40,223
Fuck you, man!

327
00:24:07,688 --> 00:24:08,746
Lee!

328
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:13,116
Lee!

329
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:21,332
Well, that's about it.

330
00:24:22,068 --> 00:24:26,061
Thank you
for your time, Detective,
and for the good police work.

331
00:24:26,606 --> 00:24:28,665
Blanchard knew the white guy,
I guess.

332
00:24:28,741 --> 00:24:30,174
Busted him once.

333
00:24:30,644 --> 00:24:32,634
He snitched for Lee
a couple of times.

334
00:24:33,646 --> 00:24:35,114
Baxter Fitch.

335
00:24:36,115 --> 00:24:38,242
It's a busy neighborhood.

336
00:24:38,318 --> 00:24:40,412
Take a look at top billing.

337
00:24:58,972 --> 00:25:01,737
All right, easy.
Guys, guys. Please.

338
00:25:03,109 --> 00:25:06,010
Don't trample over everything,
please. Easy.

339
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:08,203
Secure the area.

340
00:25:08,281 --> 00:25:11,410
All right, listen up.
No reporters view the body.

341
00:25:11,484 --> 00:25:13,544
You photo men, finish
taking your pictures now.

342
00:25:13,621 --> 00:25:16,681
Coroner's men,
put a sheet on the body
as soon as they are done.

343
00:25:16,757 --> 00:25:18,691
We set up a perimeter
six feet back.

344
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:21,318
Any reporter crosses it,
arrest him.

345
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:23,954
Now, gentlemen, before
this gets out of hand,

346
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,089
let's put the kibosh
on something.

347
00:25:26,866 --> 00:25:28,925
With publicity,
you get confessions.

348
00:25:29,002 --> 00:25:31,800
With confessions,
you get crazies,
liars and false leads.

349
00:25:31,872 --> 00:25:34,271
So, we keep some things quiet.

350
00:25:34,575 --> 00:25:37,874
The ear-to-ear
facial lacerations,

351
00:25:38,211 --> 00:25:39,701
disembowelment,

352
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:42,442
you keep this information
to yourselves.

353
00:25:42,516 --> 00:25:44,882
Not your wives,
not your girlfriends,

354
00:25:44,951 --> 00:25:47,511
no other officers,
and I mean no...

355
00:25:48,021 --> 00:25:49,955
Bleichert, what the hell
are you doing here?

356
00:25:50,023 --> 00:25:51,183
Where the hell's Blanchard?

357
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:52,623
He's right here.

358
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:55,794
Nash might be renting a room
in that building over there.

359
00:25:55,863 --> 00:25:57,660
I heard something
on the radio about
a shooting.

360
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:58,959
Was that Nash?
No.

361
00:26:00,567 --> 00:26:02,057
We had some trouble.

362
00:26:06,272 --> 00:26:08,240
Stand back!
Get back of the line!

363
00:26:08,308 --> 00:26:09,970
Move back. Come on, boys.

364
00:26:10,044 --> 00:26:11,534
Get them back!

365
00:26:13,913 --> 00:26:16,040
Hey, Raymond Nash, remember?

366
00:26:16,683 --> 00:26:18,276
We need to go
check out that room.

367
00:26:18,352 --> 00:26:19,648
Nash didn't do this.

368
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:22,950
No. But he beat
a woman to death.

369
00:26:23,022 --> 00:26:24,751
That's why
he's our priority warrantee.

370
00:26:28,729 --> 00:26:32,825
All right!
I need everybody right now!

371
00:26:34,535 --> 00:26:35,593
Baby.

372
00:26:41,008 --> 00:26:42,134
What happened?

373
00:26:42,209 --> 00:26:43,539
Nothing.
I don't want to talk about it.

374
00:26:43,611 --> 00:26:48,013
Lee, Baxter Fitch just
happened to be there?
What happened, Lee?

375
00:26:52,353 --> 00:26:53,444
What do you know about it?

376
00:26:53,519 --> 00:26:56,079
I know you, Lee.
I know you, Lee.

377
00:26:59,759 --> 00:27:00,817
Lee...

378
00:27:00,894 --> 00:27:03,124
He knew one of the guys, so...

379
00:27:06,767 --> 00:27:08,859
Dwight, was it you or them?

380
00:27:12,873 --> 00:27:14,500
He saved my life.

381
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,674
Hey, Kay,
who's Bobby DeWitt?

382
00:27:23,584 --> 00:27:25,346
I know he's an old beef
of Lee's.

383
00:27:26,787 --> 00:27:29,756
But he doesn't
want to talk about it
and he gets out in a week.

384
00:27:32,026 --> 00:27:33,755
You know who he is?

385
00:27:44,805 --> 00:27:46,534
I'm scared, Dwight.

386
00:27:49,910 --> 00:27:51,707
I'll take care of it.

387
00:27:54,213 --> 00:27:56,010
You don't know Bobby.

388
00:28:47,667 --> 00:28:49,134
<i>Bobby DeWitt.</i>

389
00:28:50,269 --> 00:28:52,864
<i>Who are these men</i>
<i>who feed on others?</i>

390
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:58,106
<i>What do they feel</i>
<i>when they cut their names</i>
<i>into somebody else's life?</i>

391
00:29:05,018 --> 00:29:07,680
<i>It was the case</i>
<i>that made Lee's career.</i>

392
00:29:07,755 --> 00:29:11,054
<i>He'd never said a word</i>
<i>about it and I'd never asked.</i>

393
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:13,958
<i>One of Lee's snitches</i>
<i>fingered Bobby DeWitt,</i>

394
00:29:14,161 --> 00:29:17,892
<i>a small-time pimp</i>
<i>with a yard-long rap,</i>
<i>as the brains behind the job.</i>

395
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:21,127
<i>DeWitt never</i>
<i>spoke the entire trial,</i>
<i>never coughing up the dough</i>

396
00:29:21,201 --> 00:29:24,465
<i>even after damning</i>
<i>character testimony</i>
<i>from some of his girls</i>

397
00:29:24,538 --> 00:29:26,300
<i>including one Katherine Lake,</i>

398
00:29:27,207 --> 00:29:28,834
<i>formerly of Sioux Falls,</i>
<i>South Dakota,</i>

399
00:29:28,909 --> 00:29:30,672
<i>and looking to go straight.</i>

400
00:29:31,711 --> 00:29:34,306
<i>DeWitt got 10 to life</i>
<i>in San Quentin.</i>

401
00:29:34,413 --> 00:29:35,778
<i>Lee got Kay</i>

402
00:29:36,849 --> 00:29:39,443
<i>or maybe it was</i>
<i>the other way around.</i>

403
00:29:45,792 --> 00:29:48,421
We're supposed to be
looking for Nash.

404
00:29:48,494 --> 00:29:49,757
Priority.

405
00:29:50,297 --> 00:29:52,355
Yeah, priority
for Homicide Division, not us.

406
00:29:52,432 --> 00:29:54,626
Nice white girl gets snuffed.

407
00:29:54,934 --> 00:29:57,596
Got to show the voters
they did the right thing
passing the bond issue.

408
00:29:57,671 --> 00:30:00,298
It's A-plus, Buck.
We don't miss this.

409
00:30:01,909 --> 00:30:04,343
Maybe she wasn't
such a nice girl.

410
00:30:04,611 --> 00:30:08,740
Maybe that old lady
that Nash snuffed was
somebody's loving granny.

411
00:30:10,784 --> 00:30:12,182
Maybe we let
the Bureau handle this

412
00:30:12,251 --> 00:30:15,982
and we get back to our job
before Nash snuffs
somebody else.

413
00:30:18,224 --> 00:30:20,021
Got any other maybes?

414
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:23,757
Yeah, maybe we've had
enough headlines.

415
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,355
With or without you, Buck.

416
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,127
With or without you.

417
00:30:30,804 --> 00:30:33,602
Therefore, we have created
a special unit

418
00:30:33,807 --> 00:30:36,070
which will include a number
of highly trained officers

419
00:30:36,143 --> 00:30:38,134
including
Detective Russell Millard,

420
00:30:38,211 --> 00:30:40,270
our very own Mr. Fire

421
00:30:40,513 --> 00:30:42,505
and his partner, Mr. Ice.

422
00:30:42,615 --> 00:30:45,585
Mr. Loew, can you assure
the public that you will find

423
00:30:45,652 --> 00:30:47,414
the murderer
before he strikes again?

424
00:30:47,487 --> 00:30:49,078
I can guarantee you

425
00:30:49,155 --> 00:30:52,215
this killer will be caught.

426
00:30:53,492 --> 00:30:55,586
You got us detached?
Slow and easy, Buck.

427
00:30:55,662 --> 00:30:59,028
I gave Loew a memo saying
Nash blew our jurisdiction.

428
00:30:59,432 --> 00:31:00,900
You did what?

429
00:31:01,468 --> 00:31:03,128
Are you fucking nuts?
It's all right.

430
00:31:03,202 --> 00:31:05,296
The APB still stands.
He's covered.

431
00:31:05,372 --> 00:31:06,498
This is the main event.

432
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:09,234
Nash is pure undercard.
Just give me another week
with this girl.

433
00:31:09,308 --> 00:31:11,503
What's your problem
with this?

434
00:31:11,577 --> 00:31:13,239
Letting Nash slip.

435
00:31:18,285 --> 00:31:22,846
On gross pathology,
we have a female Caucasian
between 16 and 30.

436
00:31:22,923 --> 00:31:25,221
The cadaver
is presented in two halves

437
00:31:25,291 --> 00:31:27,953
with bisection
level with the umbilicus.

438
00:31:28,895 --> 00:31:32,093
Through and through
lacerations
of both mouth corners.

439
00:31:32,164 --> 00:31:35,156
No visible bruising
on the neck.

440
00:31:35,669 --> 00:31:39,627
Rectangular abrasions
on the wing tips
of the sphenoid bones.

441
00:31:40,539 --> 00:31:43,976
And, oh!
A puncture wound, here,

442
00:31:45,077 --> 00:31:47,944
in the palm.
On the palm of the right hand.

443
00:31:48,582 --> 00:31:49,741
There.

444
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:55,052
Investigation of upper half
abdominal cavity reveals
no free-flowing blood.

445
00:31:55,721 --> 00:31:59,714
Intestines, stomach,
spleen, liver, all removed.

446
00:32:01,295 --> 00:32:02,955
Is it all right to smoke,
Doctor?

447
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:04,497
She won't mind.

448
00:32:04,564 --> 00:32:09,160
Lower half of cadaver
reveals removal
of all reproductive organs.

449
00:32:09,368 --> 00:32:11,097
Both legs broken at the knee.

450
00:32:11,171 --> 00:32:12,501
Questions.

451
00:32:12,739 --> 00:32:15,173
What's your best guess?
Well, here's what she wasn't,

452
00:32:15,241 --> 00:32:17,038
she wasn't raped
and she wasn't pregnant.

453
00:32:17,109 --> 00:32:18,542
In terms of the nitty-gritty,

454
00:32:18,612 --> 00:32:22,012
the cause of death
is either the mouth wound here

455
00:32:22,281 --> 00:32:25,547
or she was beaten to death
with something like
a baseball bat.

456
00:32:25,618 --> 00:32:26,881
What about her insides?

457
00:32:26,953 --> 00:32:29,012
They came out posthumously.

458
00:32:29,088 --> 00:32:31,990
I say then he drained
the blood from the body

459
00:32:32,058 --> 00:32:34,527
and washed it clean,
probably in a bathtub.

460
00:32:34,594 --> 00:32:36,561
Have you got a name yet?

461
00:32:36,963 --> 00:32:38,760
"Elizabeth Ann Short.

462
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,901
"Date of birth,
July 29, 1924,

463
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,335
"Medford, Massachusetts."

464
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:47,203
Cops popped her in '43.
Santa Barbara.

465
00:32:47,273 --> 00:32:48,798
Underage drinking.

466
00:32:48,875 --> 00:32:51,069
Other than that, she's clean.

467
00:32:51,144 --> 00:32:53,874
Four sisters,
parents divorced,
her father's here in L.A.

468
00:32:53,947 --> 00:32:57,211
Oh, and I hear he sold
some old photos of her
to the <i>Herald</i>.

469
00:32:57,550 --> 00:33:00,816
I got an alibi just in case
you think I did it.

470
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:04,115
Tighter than a crab's ass,
and that is airtight.

471
00:33:05,424 --> 00:33:06,982
Detective Bleichert,
Mr. Short.

472
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:08,391
This is Detective Blanchard.

473
00:33:08,461 --> 00:33:11,124
We would like to
express our condolences
for the loss of your daughter.

474
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:13,189
Yeah, I know who you are.

475
00:33:13,633 --> 00:33:16,727
Neither of you'd have lasted
a round against Jim Jeffries.

476
00:33:16,803 --> 00:33:19,635
And as for Betty,
she called the tune,
she paid the piper.

477
00:33:19,705 --> 00:33:20,900
You want to hear my alibi?

478
00:33:20,973 --> 00:33:22,805
Yeah, since you're
so anxious to tell it.

479
00:33:22,875 --> 00:33:25,105
Johnny on the spot
here at the diner.

480
00:33:25,178 --> 00:33:27,645
Twenty-seven straight hours
at that grill.

481
00:33:27,713 --> 00:33:30,011
Twenty-seven straight,
last 17 overtime.

482
00:33:30,083 --> 00:33:31,345
You ask anybody here.

483
00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:33,750
They'll alibi me up
tighter than a popcorn fart

484
00:33:33,819 --> 00:33:34,844
and that's
pretty fucking tight.

485
00:33:34,921 --> 00:33:37,219
When was the last time
you saw your daughter,
Mr. Short?

486
00:33:37,289 --> 00:33:40,087
Betty came west in '43,
stars in her eyes.

487
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:43,594
I promised her three squares
and a five-spot,
she kept the house tidy.

488
00:33:43,663 --> 00:33:44,823
She live with you then?

489
00:33:44,897 --> 00:33:46,694
I gave her the boot in July.

490
00:33:47,166 --> 00:33:50,432
Moved to Santa Barbara.
Sent me a postcard
a couple weeks later.

491
00:33:50,503 --> 00:33:52,131
Some soldier
beat her up pretty bad.

492
00:33:52,204 --> 00:33:53,865
That's the last
I heard from her.

493
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,531
I need three pigs
in a blanket.

494
00:33:55,608 --> 00:33:57,974
Keep your fucking panties on.

495
00:33:58,045 --> 00:34:00,137
Was that soldier
her boyfriend, Mr. Short?

496
00:34:00,212 --> 00:34:02,840
Boyfriend?
They were all her boyfriends.

497
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,548
As long as they wore
a uniform.

498
00:34:05,951 --> 00:34:08,476
See, Betty believed in
quantity before quality.

499
00:34:08,554 --> 00:34:09,954
You calling your
own daughter a tramp?

500
00:34:10,023 --> 00:34:11,684
I got five daughters.

501
00:34:11,757 --> 00:34:13,851
One rotten apple ain't so bad.

502
00:34:13,927 --> 00:34:16,724
Well, maybe this time
she had a boyfriend.

503
00:34:16,829 --> 00:34:17,989
Maybe.

504
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,358
Any names, Mr. Short?

505
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:22,163
Look, Tom, Dick, Harry,
it don't matter.

506
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:29,170
She said she was looking
for movie work,

507
00:34:30,677 --> 00:34:32,338
but she just paraded
Hollywood Boulevard

508
00:34:32,411 --> 00:34:34,208
in those black get-ups
of hers.

509
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:38,543
I mean, who wouldn't get
herself killed doing that,
huh?

510
00:34:39,219 --> 00:34:40,686
Who wouldn't?

511
00:34:46,927 --> 00:34:50,657
We just got handed the entire
U.S. armed forces as suspects.

512
00:34:51,465 --> 00:34:53,159
Flip to see
who writes it up?

513
00:34:53,233 --> 00:34:55,393
I'm staking
Nash's pad tonight.

514
00:34:55,469 --> 00:34:58,996
See if we get any strange
drive-bys at the murder scene.

515
00:34:59,271 --> 00:35:02,240
Do me a favor. Stop by
and check on Kay, will you?

516
00:35:02,309 --> 00:35:03,673
Yeah, sure.

517
00:35:07,179 --> 00:35:08,670
Hello, Dwight.

518
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:12,918
How'd you know it was me?

519
00:35:12,985 --> 00:35:14,351
Lee stomps.

520
00:35:16,456 --> 00:35:18,219
Is Lee working late?
Mmm.

521
00:35:19,693 --> 00:35:21,159
What's wrong?

522
00:35:23,597 --> 00:35:25,791
He's all bent out of shape
on this dead girl.

523
00:35:28,268 --> 00:35:30,132
He's going
a little squirrelly.

524
00:35:30,202 --> 00:35:31,965
Benzedrine, I think.

525
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:38,277
Did you read the papers?

526
00:35:38,378 --> 00:35:42,336
She's being played up
as the hottest number
since the atom bomb.

527
00:35:42,715 --> 00:35:46,550
Ellis Loew's looking
to make a career on it.
I think Lee's not far behind.

528
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:48,143
What about you?

529
00:35:49,088 --> 00:35:50,579
What about me?

530
00:35:51,992 --> 00:35:54,585
What's going to happen to us,
Dwight?

531
00:36:00,333 --> 00:36:02,699
The three of us, I don't know.
No, us.

532
00:36:03,235 --> 00:36:04,965
Just the two of us.

533
00:36:16,983 --> 00:36:18,007
Us.

534
00:36:23,657 --> 00:36:24,681
Kay,

535
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,197
there is no two of us.

536
00:36:36,168 --> 00:36:37,760
He's my partner.

537
00:36:41,373 --> 00:36:43,239
And that's everything.

538
00:36:43,543 --> 00:36:45,443
He's done a lot for me.

539
00:36:47,514 --> 00:36:49,606
He's done even more for me.

540
00:36:58,592 --> 00:37:00,684
There's food in the fridge.

541
00:37:01,061 --> 00:37:02,425
Good night.

542
00:37:41,067 --> 00:37:43,967
Thank our friend Bevo Means
at the <i>Examiner</i>.

543
00:37:44,170 --> 00:37:47,297
See, Bevo's painting
Betty in a black dress
like some actress

544
00:37:47,373 --> 00:37:50,434
in that Alan Ladd movie,
<i>Blue Dahlia.</i>

545
00:37:50,543 --> 00:37:52,010
Should triple our confessions.

546
00:37:52,077 --> 00:37:53,101
Great.

547
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:55,237
Hollywood will fuck you
when no one else will.

548
00:37:55,315 --> 00:37:57,510
Hey, Johnson,
go get a smoke.

549
00:38:00,753 --> 00:38:02,619
What do you want to do?
I want to go back to Warrants.

550
00:38:02,688 --> 00:38:03,677
No dice.

551
00:38:03,757 --> 00:38:06,351
You're a bright penny,
Bleichert,
and I need you here.

552
00:38:08,027 --> 00:38:10,963
These are Betty's last known
residences and associates.

553
00:38:11,030 --> 00:38:13,659
You go to University Station,
pick up Bill Koenig.
Fritzie's sick.

554
00:38:13,733 --> 00:38:14,994
Lieutenant...

555
00:38:15,068 --> 00:38:16,364
No. You call me Russ

556
00:38:16,635 --> 00:38:17,932
and you get out of here.

557
00:38:22,608 --> 00:38:24,304
So, how do you want
to play this, Sarge?

558
00:38:24,376 --> 00:38:26,675
Fritzie usually does
the talking.

559
00:38:26,746 --> 00:38:28,110
Muscle job?

560
00:38:29,248 --> 00:38:32,047
Why don't you let me
try and talk to her?

561
00:38:39,224 --> 00:38:41,250
All right, first question,

562
00:38:43,996 --> 00:38:46,192
does a Lorna Mertz
live here?

563
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:48,199
She used to.

564
00:38:48,835 --> 00:38:50,666
She skipped town this morning.

565
00:38:50,737 --> 00:38:54,264
But I'm holding this suitcase
till she ponies up
the back rent.

566
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:55,706
Is this it?

567
00:39:04,217 --> 00:39:06,309
Miss Short moved around
quite a bit, too, didn't she?

568
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,478
Was anybody threatening her?

569
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:08,713
Poor Betty.

570
00:39:08,788 --> 00:39:10,449
Her problem wasn't
too many enemies.

571
00:39:10,523 --> 00:39:12,012
It was too many friends.

572
00:39:12,659 --> 00:39:14,251
I gathered that.

573
00:39:15,027 --> 00:39:16,494
Okay,
let's change the subject.

574
00:39:16,563 --> 00:39:17,655
All right.

575
00:39:17,731 --> 00:39:20,130
How about the world
of high finance?

576
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:21,393
How about the movies?

577
00:39:21,467 --> 00:39:23,766
You girls are all trying
to break in, right?

578
00:39:24,336 --> 00:39:26,202
Darling, I'm in.

579
00:39:26,572 --> 00:39:28,972
Congratulations.
How about Betty?

580
00:39:30,143 --> 00:39:31,507
Maybe once.

581
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:33,637
Maybe not at all.

582
00:39:34,614 --> 00:39:36,137
She came around
last Christmas,

583
00:39:36,215 --> 00:39:38,206
bragging about
getting her big break.

584
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:42,313
Guess after all
those screen tests,
she finally got a part.

585
00:39:42,389 --> 00:39:43,413
But,

586
00:39:43,956 --> 00:39:47,414
she had a tendency to...

587
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:48,887
Stretch the truth?

588
00:39:48,961 --> 00:39:50,224
No.

589
00:39:50,429 --> 00:39:52,056
She fucking lied.

590
00:39:53,867 --> 00:39:56,233
Do you know the names
of any of her boyfriends?

591
00:40:03,076 --> 00:40:05,202
What is it?
You can tell me.

592
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:08,137
Well,

593
00:40:08,715 --> 00:40:10,978
I do remember,
before she split,

594
00:40:11,050 --> 00:40:12,210
her and Lorna...

595
00:40:12,284 --> 00:40:13,445
Mertz?

596
00:40:14,019 --> 00:40:16,045
Yeah. Her and Lorna Mertz.

597
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:20,159
I mean I don't want to
tell any tales out of school

598
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:23,561
but I do remember them being
up on Hollywood Boulevard

599
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,824
speaking to this older woman.

600
00:40:26,166 --> 00:40:27,360
And she,

601
00:40:27,666 --> 00:40:31,364
she was wearing a man's suit
and had a man's short haircut.

602
00:40:32,572 --> 00:40:34,597
But it was just that once.

603
00:40:37,043 --> 00:40:40,137
Miss Saddon,
are you saying they
were talking to a lesbian?

604
00:40:50,088 --> 00:40:51,579
Your driver's here.

605
00:40:51,657 --> 00:40:53,318
Yeah. I got to go.

606
00:40:57,931 --> 00:40:59,125
We're not done yet.

607
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:01,132
Well, then,
how about you arrest me?

608
00:41:01,201 --> 00:41:02,565
Because the truck don't wait!

609
00:41:02,635 --> 00:41:06,969
Why don't we take
a look inside Lorna's bag,
and then maybe you can go.

610
00:41:16,048 --> 00:41:17,414
That's her.

611
00:41:18,050 --> 00:41:19,677
Christ, she's 15.

612
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:23,418
Do you know what studios
Betty tested at?

613
00:41:24,657 --> 00:41:26,818
They weren't exactly studios.

614
00:41:26,893 --> 00:41:28,884
<i>Screen test,</i>
<i>Elizabeth Short.</i>

615
00:41:29,795 --> 00:41:30,956
<i>So, where are you from?</i>

616
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,121
<i>Boston.</i>

617
00:41:32,632 --> 00:41:33,893
<i>How long you've lived here?</i>

618
00:41:33,967 --> 00:41:35,025
<i>Two years.</i>

619
00:41:35,101 --> 00:41:36,864
<i>Lost your accent.</i>
<i>Yeah.</i>

620
00:41:36,936 --> 00:41:40,063
<i>You know, when in Rome. Why?</i>
<i>Are you looking for a girl</i>
<i>with an accent?</i>

621
00:41:40,139 --> 00:41:41,367
<i>No, no. That's all right.</i>

622
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,568
<i>Because I can just bring it</i>
<i>back like that.</i>

623
00:41:43,643 --> 00:41:47,010
<i>Because I'm a whiz</i>
<i>with accents and I basically</i>
<i>do every accent in the world.</i>

624
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:49,639
<i>We don't really need</i>
<i>an accent, thank you.</i>

625
00:41:49,715 --> 00:41:51,615
<i>'Cause I can be</i>
<i>from anywhere.</i>

626
00:41:52,552 --> 00:41:53,643
<i>Okay.</i>

627
00:41:54,353 --> 00:41:55,581
<i>Let's hear</i>
<i>that Boston accent.</i>

628
00:41:55,655 --> 00:41:57,179
<i>Now?</i>
<i>Yes.</i>

629
00:41:57,257 --> 00:41:59,121
<i>No, I can't do it now.</i>

630
00:41:59,324 --> 00:42:02,782
<i>I would have to meet with</i>
<i>my dialect coach, Milton Perl,</i>

631
00:42:03,762 --> 00:42:06,596
<i>who was introduced to me</i>
<i>by David Selznick.</i>

632
00:42:07,166 --> 00:42:08,599
<i>You know</i>
<i>David O. Selznick?</i>

633
00:42:08,668 --> 00:42:09,793
<i>I do.</i>

634
00:42:09,869 --> 00:42:12,132
<i>He's been very,</i>
<i>very, very kind to me.</i>

635
00:42:12,204 --> 00:42:15,298
<i>He's taken me out</i>
<i>to such beautiful dinners</i>

636
00:42:15,375 --> 00:42:16,706
<i>in fancy restaurants.</i>

637
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:19,304
<i>And he's treated me</i>
<i>like a lady</i>

638
00:42:19,378 --> 00:42:20,971
<i>and with respect</i>

639
00:42:21,047 --> 00:42:22,570
<i>and guess what.</i>

640
00:42:23,115 --> 00:42:24,742
<i>He was very, very,</i>
<i>very impressed</i>

641
00:42:24,817 --> 00:42:26,978
<i>when I did my Scarlett</i>
<i>for him.</i>

642
00:42:27,052 --> 00:42:29,282
<i>You auditioned for</i>
<i>Scarlett O'Hara?</i>

643
00:42:29,355 --> 00:42:33,257
<i>No, I didn't audition for</i>
Gone With The Wind,
<i>but, the thing is...</i>

644
00:42:34,059 --> 00:42:36,585
<i>Gosh, I just love that movie</i>
<i>so much</i>

645
00:42:36,862 --> 00:42:41,322
<i>that I decided</i>
<i>that I had to memorize</i>
<i>all of Scarlett's dialog.</i>

646
00:42:42,802 --> 00:42:43,860
<i>Well...</i>

647
00:42:44,637 --> 00:42:45,864
<i>And I want to do it for you</i>

648
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:47,371
<i>because I think</i>
<i>you're handsome.</i>

649
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,635
<i>No, no, I don't think</i>
<i>we need that...</i>
<i>But I think you're handsome</i>

650
00:42:49,708 --> 00:42:52,177
<i>and I'm going to do it</i>
<i>for you right now.</i>

<i>"I'll never go hungry again."</i>

658
00:43:27,012 --> 00:43:28,480
He hated her.

659
00:43:28,847 --> 00:43:31,840
Bad, and he wanted
the whole world to know it.

660
00:43:32,385 --> 00:43:33,818
Lee, you got to eat something.

661
00:43:33,885 --> 00:43:36,376
Get this off the table!
God damn it!

662
00:43:37,155 --> 00:43:39,282
Dwight,
you got to do something.

663
00:43:39,358 --> 00:43:40,791
He's been like this
since last night.

664
00:43:40,860 --> 00:43:42,760
Get some air.
I'll take care of him.

665
00:43:42,829 --> 00:43:45,126
Bucky,
this ain't a random job.

666
00:43:45,297 --> 00:43:48,027
He knew what he was doing
every single step of the way.

667
00:43:52,505 --> 00:43:55,235
You learn anything
about our girl today?

668
00:43:56,742 --> 00:43:58,505
Nothing worth
you doing this to yourself.

669
00:43:58,577 --> 00:44:00,603
Come on.
Let's get out of here.
No, I'm staying here with her.

670
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:01,840
Come on.

671
00:44:02,748 --> 00:44:04,579

serving raisinjack

690
00:45:03,643 --> 00:45:07,204
A couple of times.
Two or three months ago.

691
00:45:07,313 --> 00:45:09,474
She used to get drinks
off the sisters,

692
00:45:09,548 --> 00:45:12,847
though, she liked boys.
I'm sure, man.

693
00:45:13,286 --> 00:45:15,219
Not the Dahlia. Never.

694
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:20,916

00:45:21,293 --> 00:45:24,956

Excuse me, ladies.
I'm sorry.

704
00:45:58,264 --> 00:46:00,664
I was wondering
if you've seen this girl.

705
00:46:01,367 --> 00:46:02,425
Have you?

706
00:46:02,501 --> 00:46:03,628
No.

707
00:46:03,702 --> 00:46:09,369
<i>Everything but true love</i>

708
00:46:09,442 --> 00:46:10,909
Haven't seen her.

709
00:46:10,976 --> 00:46:12,376
This girl?

720
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:28,144
I will not have these
in my house anymore.

721
00:47:28,221 --> 00:47:29,210
No!

722
00:47:29,288 --> 00:47:30,311
It is insane!

723
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:33,152
After everything
that's happened to us, Lee.
I will nail this guy, Kay!

724
00:47:33,226 --> 00:47:35,456
I'll do this,
I will do this!

725
00:47:41,166 --> 00:47:43,692
Talk to her, Bucky.
Reason with her.

726
00:47:47,706 --> 00:47:48,867
Jesus.

727
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:53,204
Lee, she's right.

728
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,846
There's at least
three misdemeanors here.

729
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:56,903
You can't...

730
00:48:06,858 --> 00:48:08,985
I promised him a week on this.
Four more days, and it's over.

731
00:48:09,061 --> 00:48:12,121
Dwight, you can be
so gutless sometimes,
you know that?

732
00:48:15,101 --> 00:48:17,034
<i>Three days</i>
<i>since we killed four men.</i>

733
00:48:17,103 --> 00:48:19,536
<i>Three days</i>
<i>until Bobby DeWitt got out.</i>

734
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:23,507
<i>I tried to tell myself</i>
<i>I was the sturdy leg</i>
<i>in our little triangle.</i>

735
00:48:23,576 --> 00:48:25,065
<i>I was worried it was true.</i>

736
00:48:58,077 --> 00:49:00,045
Slumming, Miss Linscott?

737
00:49:02,447 --> 00:49:03,710
I am now.

738
00:49:04,382 --> 00:49:06,373
Daddy spying on me again?

739
00:49:07,853 --> 00:49:10,253
"Maddy, girl,
you shouldn't
be congregating

740
00:49:10,322 --> 00:49:12,449
"in such unsuitable places."

741
00:49:12,525 --> 00:49:14,117
I'm a policeman.

742
00:49:16,262 --> 00:49:17,889
That's a new one.

743
00:49:19,931 --> 00:49:21,193
Homicide.

744
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,630
Let's try Elizabeth Short
and Lorna Mertz.

745
00:49:23,702 --> 00:49:25,568
I know you knew them,
so don't jerk me off.

746
00:49:25,637 --> 00:49:29,074
Otherwise, it's downtown
and a whole lot of publicity.

747
00:49:40,186 --> 00:49:41,949
This is all a fluke.

748
00:49:42,054 --> 00:49:44,248
I met them at LaVerne's
last fall.

749
00:49:44,322 --> 00:49:47,018
Betty, maybe one time.
Lorna, a couple.

750
00:49:47,126 --> 00:49:50,583
They'd come in
to cadge a drink
or a meal off a sister.

751
00:49:51,563 --> 00:49:53,862
So why'd you rabbit
last night?

752
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:56,594
Mister,
my father is Emmett Linscott.

753
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:00,800
The Emmett Linscott?

754
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:03,606
He built half of Hollywood
and Long Beach.

755
00:50:03,675 --> 00:50:05,541
Imagine the headlines,

756
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:10,106
"Construction Tycoon's
Daughter Questioned
in Dahlia Case.

757
00:50:10,181 --> 00:50:11,773
"Footsie
at Lesbian Nightclub."

758
00:50:11,851 --> 00:50:13,079
Get the picture?

759
00:50:13,152 --> 00:50:14,641
Technicolor.

760
00:50:15,621 --> 00:50:17,612
So what'd you talk about?

761
00:50:18,858 --> 00:50:19,916
When?

762
00:50:19,992 --> 00:50:21,686
When you were playing footsie.

763
00:50:25,864 --> 00:50:30,699
Lorna talked about her stupid
boyfriend back in Hicktown,
Nebraska, or wherever.

764
00:50:31,536 --> 00:50:34,563
Betty talked about the latest
issue of <i>Screen World</i>.

765
00:50:35,673 --> 00:50:39,074
Starlets, Hollywood dreams,
the whole sad nine yards.

766
00:50:39,545 --> 00:50:42,275
So, did Betty ever tell you
about a movie she was in?

767
00:50:42,347 --> 00:50:45,840
On a conversational level,
they were right up there
with you.

768
00:50:45,918 --> 00:50:47,943
Cute. Answer the question.

769
00:50:49,221 --> 00:50:52,679
Look, I'm tired.
Do you want my alibi
so I can go home?

770
00:50:53,925 --> 00:50:55,018
Sure.

771
00:50:55,561 --> 00:51:00,498
My family and I were in Laguna
from Sunday through Thursday,
along with the servants.

772
00:51:00,565 --> 00:51:02,226
If you want verification,
call Daddy,

773
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:04,393
but please be discreet.

774
00:51:10,976 --> 00:51:11,965
So,

775
00:51:14,045 --> 00:51:16,878
what do I have to do to keep
my name out of the papers?

776
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,576
What do you mean?

777
00:51:19,784 --> 00:51:21,878
That's not very convincing.

778
00:51:23,456 --> 00:51:26,425
I don't need
your Daddy's money,
if that's what you're saying.

779
00:51:26,492 --> 00:51:28,619
You know it's not
what I'm saying.

780
00:51:32,264 --> 00:51:33,788
I might be convinced.

781
00:51:36,001 --> 00:51:37,797
Tomorrow night, 8:00.

782
00:51:38,237 --> 00:51:41,137
My address is 482
South Muirfield,
Hancock Park.

783
00:51:41,206 --> 00:51:42,639
I know the address.

784
00:51:42,708 --> 00:51:44,106
Not surprised.

785
00:51:44,242 --> 00:51:45,335
Pick me up.

786
00:51:45,411 --> 00:51:47,902
Like a gentleman,
not like a cop.

787
00:51:48,947 --> 00:51:50,643
Oh, one more thing.

788
00:51:50,849 --> 00:51:52,010
What's your name?

789
00:51:52,083 --> 00:51:53,277
Bucky Bleichert.

790
00:51:53,351 --> 00:51:54,340
Bucky?

791
00:51:56,188 --> 00:51:57,780
I'll try to remember.

792
00:51:58,590 --> 00:52:00,581
I can hear you just fine.

793
00:52:03,695 --> 00:52:06,858
Look, ma'am, you mind?
I've just learned to type.

794
00:52:07,233 --> 00:52:10,293
Yes, I understand.
A werewolf and Red Sheridan.

795
00:52:12,137 --> 00:52:14,731
What if the werewolf
is Red Sheridan?

796
00:52:15,574 --> 00:52:18,007
Yes, that would be
more efficient.

797
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:22,271
I love tip duty.

798
00:52:23,282 --> 00:52:24,543
How's Kay?

799
00:52:24,682 --> 00:52:25,945
Not good.

800
00:52:26,351 --> 00:52:29,981
You mind if I bunk out
at your pop's place
for a few days?

801
00:52:30,322 --> 00:52:31,516
Sure.

802
00:52:31,590 --> 00:52:33,079
Thanks.

803
00:52:41,833 --> 00:52:43,061
DeWitt gets out tomorrow,
Lee.

804
00:52:43,135 --> 00:52:44,795
I was thinking maybe
I should talk to him.

805
00:52:48,541 --> 00:52:50,269
Blanchard, Homicide.

806
00:52:50,509 --> 00:52:51,601
Lee.

807
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:16,590
All right, people,
let's get back to work here.

808
00:53:16,668 --> 00:53:18,226
Yeah, it's an earthquake.
I heard it.

809
00:54:10,222 --> 00:54:12,815
Look, I didn't know
you were a boxer.

810
00:54:13,324 --> 00:54:16,692
Daddy's heard of you
and he insists
you stay for dinner.

811
00:54:16,762 --> 00:54:19,230
I told him
we met at that art exhibit
at Stanley Rose's Book Shop.

812
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:22,927
So, if you have
to pump everybody
for my alibi, be subtle.

813
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:29,099
Who's this?

814
00:54:29,173 --> 00:54:30,572
Balto.

815
00:54:30,675 --> 00:54:34,510
The paper is the <i>L.A. Times</i>
for August 1, 1926.

816
00:54:35,014 --> 00:54:36,481
Balto was bringing in
the paper

817
00:54:36,547 --> 00:54:39,141
when Daddy found out
he made his first million.

818
00:54:39,617 --> 00:54:42,416
He wanted to consecrate
the moment,

819
00:54:42,721 --> 00:54:44,244
so he shot him.

820
00:54:45,391 --> 00:54:46,789
Here we go.

821
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:52,489
Mother, Father,
this is my friend, Bucky.

822
00:54:53,132 --> 00:54:56,226
Bucky, this is my mother,
Ramona Cathcart Linscott.

823
00:54:56,302 --> 00:54:57,929
Nice to meet you.

824
00:54:58,202 --> 00:55:00,228
My father,
Emmett Linscott.

825
00:55:00,306 --> 00:55:01,568
Pleasure to meet you,
sir.

826
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:04,438
And my sister,
Martha McConville Linscott.

827
00:55:04,777 --> 00:55:05,800
Hi.

828
00:55:07,112 --> 00:55:11,070
Saw you fight Mondo Sanchez.
Boxed the pants off him.

829
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:13,184
Another Billy Conn
you might have been.

830
00:55:13,251 --> 00:55:14,344
Thanks.

831
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:15,751
Can I get you something?
Sure.

832
00:55:15,820 --> 00:55:18,221
I'll get it, Daddy.
Okay, darling.

833
00:55:18,289 --> 00:55:21,452
Mondo gave a good show.
Whatever happened to him?

834
00:55:22,161 --> 00:55:23,753
Heroin overdose.

835
00:55:23,929 --> 00:55:25,157
Too bad.

836
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:27,494
He shamed his family.

837
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,467
And speaking of families,

838
00:55:30,768 --> 00:55:32,565
Ramona, Martha.

839
00:55:33,539 --> 00:55:35,972
That's our best Glenlivet,
laddie.

840
00:55:40,579 --> 00:55:44,413
Madeleine says nice things
about you.

841
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:46,811
Daddy,

842
00:55:48,420 --> 00:55:49,784
can we eat?

843
00:55:50,688 --> 00:55:53,282
Bucky and I want
to catch a 9:30 show.

844
00:55:54,425 --> 00:55:56,155
Of course, darling.

845
00:56:02,601 --> 00:56:03,760
Dig in, lad.

846
00:56:03,869 --> 00:56:06,201
Hearty fare breeds
hearty people.

847
00:56:06,271 --> 00:56:08,670
Haute cuisine breeds
degenerates.

848
00:56:09,541 --> 00:56:11,907
I want to draw
Mr. Bleichert, Daddy.

849
00:56:11,976 --> 00:56:14,639
You're in for
a cruel caricaturing, Bucky.

850
00:56:14,713 --> 00:56:18,239
Maddy's my pretty one,
but Martha's
my certified genius.

851
00:56:18,617 --> 00:56:20,847
What kind of a name
is Bleichert? Dutch?

852
00:56:20,918 --> 00:56:22,112
German.

853
00:56:22,887 --> 00:56:25,014
A great people, the Germans.

854
00:56:25,324 --> 00:56:27,416
Hitler was a bit excessive.

855
00:56:27,826 --> 00:56:29,817
But mark my words
that someday we'll regret

856
00:56:29,894 --> 00:56:32,887
not joining forces with him
to fight the Reds.

857
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:36,693
You know,
I killed a lot of your
countrymen during the war.

858
00:56:36,768 --> 00:56:39,931
Mr. Bleichert, have you
met Balto in the hallway?

859
00:56:40,371 --> 00:56:42,101
Yes. Very realistic.

860
00:56:42,173 --> 00:56:44,108
An old friend
stuffed him.

861
00:56:44,175 --> 00:56:46,643
We were in the Scots Regiment
together. Georgie Tilden.

862
00:56:46,711 --> 00:56:48,269
He wanted to work
in the flickers.

863
00:56:48,347 --> 00:56:49,371
When did you move here?

864
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:50,505
1920.

865
00:56:50,581 --> 00:56:54,177
Hollywood was a cow pasture
but the silent flickers
were booming.

866
00:56:54,253 --> 00:56:56,686
Georgie got work
as a lighting man,
me building houses.

867
00:56:56,755 --> 00:56:59,188
Georgie introduced me
to Mack Sennett.

868
00:56:59,257 --> 00:57:01,192
I helped him build
that housing project
he was putting up

869
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:03,193
underneath
that god-awful sign.

870
00:57:03,327 --> 00:57:04,420
Hollywoodland.

871
00:57:04,496 --> 00:57:05,690
I used to love
the <i>Keystone Kops.</i>

872
00:57:05,764 --> 00:57:07,492
Me, too.

873
00:57:07,565 --> 00:57:10,364
Old Mack knew how
to squeeze a dollar dry.

874
00:57:11,702 --> 00:57:15,139
He had extras moonlighting
as laborers and vice versa.

875
00:57:15,606 --> 00:57:17,438
Georgie and I used to drive
them over to Hollywoodland

876
00:57:17,509 --> 00:57:18,907
after 12 hours
on a silent flicker.

877
00:57:18,976 --> 00:57:22,344
Then put in another six hours
by torchlight.

878
00:57:22,414 --> 00:57:25,507
He even gave us movie credits
a couple of times.

879
00:57:29,755 --> 00:57:30,949
Mother.

880
00:57:31,556 --> 00:57:33,320
Are you feeling well?

881
00:57:33,391 --> 00:57:36,554
Would you like to contribute
to the conversation?

882
00:57:41,233 --> 00:57:44,327
Did you know, Mr. Bleichert,

883
00:57:46,605 --> 00:57:49,335
that Ramona Boulevard
is named after me?

884
00:57:50,141 --> 00:57:51,403
I didn't.

885
00:57:52,443 --> 00:57:55,641
When Emmett married me,

886
00:57:57,081 --> 00:57:58,947
for my father's money,

887
00:58:00,284 --> 00:58:02,981
he promised my family
that he would use
his influence

888
00:58:03,054 --> 00:58:05,114
with the City Zoning Board

889
00:58:05,224 --> 00:58:07,556
to have a street named
after me.

890
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:11,360
But all he could manage

891
00:58:12,597 --> 00:58:14,360
was a dead-end block

892
00:58:15,166 --> 00:58:17,067
in a red-light district

893
00:58:18,402 --> 00:58:20,871
in Lincoln Heights.

894
00:58:22,074 --> 00:58:25,510
Are you familiar with
the neighborhood,
Mr. Bleichert?

895
00:58:26,777 --> 00:58:28,369
I grew up there.

896
00:58:33,050 --> 00:58:34,313
Yes, well,

897
00:58:34,853 --> 00:58:38,152
then you'll know
that Mexican prostitutes

898
00:58:39,157 --> 00:58:41,351
expose themselves
in windows.

899
00:58:43,195 --> 00:58:47,153
I hear many of them
know Mr. Linscott by name.

900
00:58:47,365 --> 00:58:48,856
That's enough!

901
00:58:51,637 --> 00:58:56,472
I will sing for my supper

902
00:58:56,875 --> 00:59:00,072
when Mayor Bowron comes
to dinner,

903
00:59:00,144 --> 00:59:02,773
but not

904
00:59:02,847 --> 00:59:06,248
for Madeleine's male whores.

905
00:59:06,652 --> 00:59:08,778
He's a common policeman.

906
00:59:08,853 --> 00:59:10,047
My God, Emmett!

907
00:59:12,724 --> 00:59:14,521
How little you think of me.

908
00:59:29,708 --> 00:59:33,166
I'm sorry.
I'm really so sorry.

909
00:59:36,081 --> 00:59:37,342
Mr. Bleichert.

910
01:01:25,157 --> 01:01:27,420
You kept your name
out of the papers.

911
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,827
Until the wedding.

912
01:01:30,795 --> 01:01:32,626
Your mother would love that.

913
01:01:34,965 --> 01:01:36,364
She's a snob.

914
01:01:44,009 --> 01:01:46,773
The kind who takes pills
the doctor gives her

915
01:01:48,980 --> 01:01:51,744
so she doesn't have to admit
to being a hophead.

916
01:01:58,757 --> 01:02:00,690
Do you want to know a secret?

917
01:02:00,759 --> 01:02:02,021
Sure.

918
01:02:03,461 --> 01:02:05,054
Daddy bought
rotten lumber

919
01:02:05,130 --> 01:02:06,960
and old movie sets
from Mack Sennett

920
01:02:07,032 --> 01:02:08,931
and built houses
out of them.

921
01:02:09,501 --> 01:02:11,695
That's how he really made
his money.

922
01:02:14,005 --> 01:02:16,701
He's got firetraps
all over L.A.

923
01:02:18,510 --> 01:02:23,208
His good friend Georgie,
maimed in a car crash,

924
01:02:24,315 --> 01:02:26,476
while running Daddy
some errands.

925
01:02:28,186 --> 01:02:30,746
And now he throws him scraps,

926
01:02:30,822 --> 01:02:34,086
odd jobs, tending
Daddy's rental properties.

927
01:02:34,458 --> 01:02:36,449
You don't have
to tell me this.

928
01:02:40,498 --> 01:02:41,965
I like you, Bucky.

929
01:02:54,746 --> 01:02:56,976
I didn't tell you
all about Betty.

930
01:02:58,650 --> 01:02:59,878
You didn't?

931
01:03:00,351 --> 01:03:02,286
Don't be mad at me.

932
01:03:03,554 --> 01:03:07,355
Last summer, I heard about
a girl who looked like me.

933
01:03:08,092 --> 01:03:09,753
I got curious.

934
01:03:10,628 --> 01:03:12,119
I left notes
at a couple of places,

935
01:03:12,197 --> 01:03:15,222
"Your look-alike
wants to meet you,"
things like that.

936
01:03:15,733 --> 01:03:17,224
I left my number.

937
01:03:18,536 --> 01:03:19,867
She called.

938
01:03:21,072 --> 01:03:23,632
That's how I met her
at LaVerne's with Lorna.

939
01:03:25,577 --> 01:03:27,271
And that's all of it?

940
01:03:27,344 --> 01:03:28,539
Yes.

941
01:03:46,097 --> 01:03:47,496
Tell me something.

942
01:03:48,867 --> 01:03:51,199
Why'd you want to meet
Betty Short anyway?

943
01:03:51,268 --> 01:03:54,204
I've worked hard to be loose

944
01:03:57,342 --> 01:03:59,742
but the way people
described Betty

945
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:04,614
it was like she was a natural.

946
01:04:05,483 --> 01:04:06,780
<i>"Don't walk out on me,</i>
<i>Richard.</i>

947
01:04:06,851 --> 01:04:08,342
<i>"Say you care.</i>
<i>Say that you..."</i>

948
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:09,681
<i>Miss Short.</i>

949
01:04:09,753 --> 01:04:12,222
<i>There is a pause</i>
<i>after "care".</i>

950
01:04:12,289 --> 01:04:14,655
<i>Are you familiar</i>
<i>with the English language?</i>

951
01:04:17,161 --> 01:04:18,527
<i>I try to be.</i>

952
01:04:18,597 --> 01:04:19,824
<i>Okay.</i>

953
01:04:20,865 --> 01:04:22,492
<i>Let's try it again.</i>

954
01:04:22,567 --> 01:04:25,434
<i>And remember,</i>
<i>go back to the beginning,</i>
<i>you're begging him.</i>

955
01:04:25,503 --> 01:04:26,867
<i>Begging.</i>

956
01:04:26,938 --> 01:04:28,199
<i>He's walking out on you.</i>

957
01:04:28,273 --> 01:04:29,467
<i>You're begging him.</i>

958
01:04:29,541 --> 01:04:30,530
<i>So, come on, let's do it.</i>

959
01:04:30,608 --> 01:04:32,668
<i>We're running out of</i>
<i>film here. Let's go.</i>

960
01:04:44,389 --> 01:04:49,190
<i>Richard,</i>
<i>don't walk out on me.</i>

961
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:52,188
<i>Please say that you care.</i>

962
01:04:52,264 --> 01:04:56,530
<i>Say that you think</i>
<i>that I'm beautiful,</i>

963
01:04:56,601 --> 01:04:58,228
<i>and that you love me.</i>

964
01:04:58,402 --> 01:05:02,840
<i>Miss Short, you know,</i>
<i>this is a very sad scene.</i>

965
01:05:02,907 --> 01:05:07,038
<i>Do you think you're capable</i>
<i>of playing sadness?</i>

966
01:05:12,918 --> 01:05:14,077
<i>Sure.</i>

967
01:05:16,253 --> 01:05:17,777
<i>I can do that.</i>

968
01:06:04,335 --> 01:06:05,360
Miss!

969
01:06:13,478 --> 01:06:15,672
Get your hands off her!
I'm an emancipated minor

970
01:06:15,746 --> 01:06:17,213
and if you touch me

971
01:06:17,282 --> 01:06:19,715
without a matron present
I'll sue you!

972
01:06:19,784 --> 01:06:21,307
Leave her alone.
No!

973
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:24,480
I'm a policeman. Policeman.

974
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:28,715
You and Betty made
the casting rounds
together, right?

975
01:06:28,827 --> 01:06:29,987
Did you ever get
any movie work?

976
01:06:30,061 --> 01:06:31,289
No.

977
01:06:31,496 --> 01:06:33,690
Well, then,
what about the film can?

978
01:06:35,532 --> 01:06:38,365
It's a movie.

979
01:06:38,436 --> 01:06:39,835
What kind of movie?

980
01:06:39,903 --> 01:06:42,532
Something tells me
it's not David O. Selznick.

981
01:06:43,141 --> 01:06:47,474
Now, you have to tell us
the whole thing, sweetheart,
so think it through.

982
01:06:50,547 --> 01:06:54,108
I was cadging
at a bar in Gardena.

983
01:06:55,253 --> 01:06:57,550
This man started
talking to me.

984
01:06:59,391 --> 01:07:02,155
I thought I was pregnant

985
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:05,128
and I was desperate
wicked bad for money.

986
01:07:05,996 --> 01:07:09,523
He said he'd give me $200
to act in a nudie film.

987
01:07:11,635 --> 01:07:15,800
He said he needed another
girl, so I called Betty.

988
01:07:20,045 --> 01:07:21,842
We made... Thank you.

989
01:07:22,012 --> 01:07:24,708
...the movie at this big house

990
01:07:24,782 --> 01:07:26,375
a couple of hours
outside town.

991
01:07:27,351 --> 01:07:29,047
Then he drove us
back to L.A.

992
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:31,054
Where was this house,
exactly?

993
01:07:33,391 --> 01:07:35,621
I was pretty out of it,
if you know what I mean.

994
01:08:35,019 --> 01:08:36,452
What do you think, Russ?

995
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:39,216
This got anything to do
with the girl's murder?

996
01:08:39,490 --> 01:08:40,822
Long shot, Chief.

997
01:09:25,869 --> 01:09:29,738
What's that about, gentlemen?
Your boy can't hold his water?

998
01:09:29,908 --> 01:09:31,273
I got you Warrants.

999
01:09:31,341 --> 01:09:33,207
You're my men
and you made me
look like a fool

1000
01:09:33,278 --> 01:09:35,769
in front of
the most powerful
man in the department.

1001
01:09:35,846 --> 01:09:39,043
And you...
Yeah, you. Look at me.

1002
01:09:39,216 --> 01:09:41,947
Blanchard? Look at me!

1003
01:09:43,654 --> 01:09:45,179
If you weren't Mr. Fire,

1004
01:09:45,456 --> 01:09:47,320
you would be suspended
from duty already.

1005
01:09:47,391 --> 01:09:49,622
You're a punch-drunk,
washed-up fighter...

1006
01:09:49,694 --> 01:09:51,161
Stay out of this, Bleichert!

1007
01:09:51,229 --> 01:09:53,355
You're back on Warrants
as of tomorrow.

1008
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:55,956
I want you to report to me
at 0800

1009
01:09:56,033 --> 01:09:58,092
with a letter of apology
for Chief Green.

1010
01:09:58,603 --> 01:10:01,503
You are a political animal,

1011
01:10:01,639 --> 01:10:03,368
and for the sake
of your pension,

1012
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:05,408
I suggest that you grovel.

1013
01:10:23,328 --> 01:10:25,887
It is now 8:15
in the morning.

1014
01:10:25,963 --> 01:10:27,453
Where's your partner?

1015
01:10:27,731 --> 01:10:28,960
I don't know.
I was hoping he'd be here.

1016
01:10:29,033 --> 01:10:31,661
Well, it is 8:15
and he is not here

1017
01:10:31,735 --> 01:10:33,795
and neither
are his letters of apology.

1018
01:10:44,849 --> 01:10:48,046
Bleichert,
get out of my sight.

1019
01:10:49,052 --> 01:10:50,713
<i>Try and be a police officer.</i>

1020
01:10:50,787 --> 01:10:54,189
<i>Attention</i>
<i>all units in the vicinity</i>
<i>of Crenshaw and Stocker.</i>

1021
01:10:54,259 --> 01:10:55,590
<i>Code four.</i>

1022
01:10:55,659 --> 01:10:58,094
<i>Two dead. Suspect, dead.</i>

1023
01:10:58,729 --> 01:11:03,632
<i>Raymond "Junior" Nash.</i>
<i>Warrant number 5-6-0-9.</i>

1024
01:11:03,768 --> 01:11:05,667
<i>Repeat. Code four.</i>

1025
01:11:34,899 --> 01:11:36,729
<i>We forgot</i>
<i>about Junior Nash.</i>

1026
01:11:39,203 --> 01:11:41,762
<i>Here he is, dead</i>
<i>in the middle of a stickup.</i>

1027
01:11:41,939 --> 01:11:43,270
<i>He was trash and a killer</i>

1028
01:11:43,341 --> 01:11:45,309
<i>and I'd been right</i>
<i>from the beginning.</i>

1029
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:48,877
<i>We let him slip</i>
<i>and the innocent died.</i>

1030
01:12:04,695 --> 01:12:05,685
Blanchard!

1031
01:12:05,762 --> 01:12:06,957
He's in the men's.

1032
01:12:12,837 --> 01:12:15,305
No. I beat up a wall.
For messing up Nash...

1033
01:12:15,372 --> 01:12:16,738
Not good enough.

1034
01:12:17,140 --> 01:12:18,471
I'm sorry, Bucky.

1035
01:12:18,542 --> 01:12:20,135
Not good enough.

1036
01:12:25,015 --> 01:12:26,243
I'm sorry.

1037
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,586
Oh, fuck, Lee! Fuck!

1038
01:12:32,957 --> 01:12:34,856
<i>Losing the first</i>
<i>Bleichert-Blanchard fight</i>

1039
01:12:34,926 --> 01:12:36,449
<i>got me local celebrity</i>
<i>Warrants</i>

1040
01:12:36,527 --> 01:12:38,926
<i>and close to nine grand</i>
<i>in cash.</i>

1041
01:12:39,697 --> 01:12:41,460
<i>Winning the rematch</i>
<i>got me a sprained wrist,</i>

1042
01:12:41,532 --> 01:12:43,796
<i>two dislocated knuckles</i>
<i>and the rest of the day off.</i>

1043
01:12:43,868 --> 01:12:45,198
Smile at me.

1044
01:12:46,604 --> 01:12:49,037
Look soft and sweet.

1045
01:12:54,779 --> 01:12:57,042
I picked up
Lorna Mertz yesterday.

1046
01:13:00,016 --> 01:13:03,417
She had a copy
of a stag film,

1047
01:13:03,488 --> 01:13:05,581
her and Betty Short
playing les.

1048
01:13:08,525 --> 01:13:10,118
Pretty spooky stuff.

1049
01:13:13,029 --> 01:13:14,792
Did she mention me?

1050
01:13:15,065 --> 01:13:16,533
No.

1051
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:23,970
And I checked
the case file.

1052
01:13:25,542 --> 01:13:28,774
No mention of that
number-leaving note
thing that you did.

1053
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:39,282
Listen,

1054
01:13:45,930 --> 01:13:48,023
I'm withholding evidence
for you.

1055
01:13:50,033 --> 01:13:52,161
It's a fair trade
but it shakes me.

1056
01:13:54,604 --> 01:13:55,867
Are you sure
there isn't anything

1057
01:13:55,939 --> 01:13:58,100
you haven't told me
about you and Betty?

1058
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:10,514
Betty and I made love once,
that one time last summer.

1059
01:14:17,127 --> 01:14:19,118
I just did it to see
what it would be like

1060
01:14:19,197 --> 01:14:20,663
to do it with someone
who looked like me.

1061
01:14:20,730 --> 01:14:21,958
Jesus Christ.

1062
01:14:29,140 --> 01:14:32,006
Bucky, that's it. I swear.

1063
01:14:40,117 --> 01:14:41,743
Bucky, please stay.

1064
01:14:45,122 --> 01:14:46,453
You stupid slut.

1065
01:14:46,524 --> 01:14:48,082
Stay. Sugar, stay!

1066
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:17,710
Hey.

1067
01:15:20,490 --> 01:15:21,980
We're famous, Dwight.

1068
01:15:24,628 --> 01:15:25,823
Notorious.

1069
01:15:27,664 --> 01:15:28,996
Where's Lee?

1070
01:15:35,539 --> 01:15:37,905
Bobby DeWitt's
probably in L.A. by now.

1071
01:15:40,144 --> 01:15:42,237
Lee always said I'd be safe.

1072
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:47,208
You will be. You will be.

1073
01:15:52,256 --> 01:15:53,746
He had a sister.

1074
01:15:56,027 --> 01:15:57,085
What?

1075
01:16:00,430 --> 01:16:02,057
He had a little sister.

1076
01:16:02,832 --> 01:16:04,595
She was killed
when Lee was 15,

1077
01:16:04,668 --> 01:16:06,659
and they never
caught the guy.

1078
01:16:11,576 --> 01:16:12,667
Why...

1079
01:16:13,911 --> 01:16:15,640
Why didn't you tell me
this before?

1080
01:16:15,712 --> 01:16:17,976
He made me promise
never to tell you.

1081
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:22,016
He thought it made him
too easy to figure.

1082
01:16:22,086 --> 01:16:24,247
Well, it sure explains
some things.

1083
01:16:25,722 --> 01:16:27,087
No, it doesn't.

1084
01:16:27,158 --> 01:16:28,488
Kay, where's Lee?

1085
01:16:31,895 --> 01:16:33,921
If you know,
you should tell me.

1086
01:16:37,234 --> 01:16:40,396
Kay,
Bobby DeWitt just got out.

1087
01:16:41,271 --> 01:16:42,863
Lee's all hopped up
on Benzedrine,

1088
01:16:42,939 --> 01:16:45,203
so what do you
think is going to happen?

1089
01:16:48,679 --> 01:16:49,907
Where is he?

1090
01:16:57,787 --> 01:17:00,621
Morrie Friedman called
a couple of hours ago.

1091
01:17:01,324 --> 01:17:03,020
The guy from New Year's?

1092
01:17:04,828 --> 01:17:06,956
Bobby's got a drug deal
somewhere

1093
01:17:07,731 --> 01:17:09,996
in a building Friedman owns,
the Olympic, I think.

1094
01:17:10,067 --> 01:17:11,055
When?

1095
01:17:16,407 --> 01:17:17,805
Now.
Jesus.

1096
01:17:17,875 --> 01:17:19,001
Dwight.

1097
01:18:07,190 --> 01:18:08,418
Bobby DeWitt?

1098
01:18:08,826 --> 01:18:09,952
Get your hands up.

1099
01:18:10,027 --> 01:18:11,618
Get up against that wall
over there.

1100
01:18:11,695 --> 01:18:13,856
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

1101
01:18:13,930 --> 01:18:15,363
Jesus.

1102
01:18:28,878 --> 01:18:31,073
I ain't out one week, and...

1103
01:18:33,384 --> 01:18:35,851
You're here for a drug deal
with Morrie Friedman.
I know that.

1104
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:38,114
Look, I'm just looking
for a place to take a piss.

1105
01:18:38,189 --> 01:18:40,384
Lee Blanchard's here.
Did you know that?
Blanchard?

1106
01:18:40,457 --> 01:18:43,621
Man-oh-Manischewitz,
I ain't seen Blanchard
since my fucking trial.

1107
01:18:43,694 --> 01:18:45,161
Yeah,
but he's been on your mind.

1108
01:18:45,229 --> 01:18:46,695
And you've been on his mind.

1109
01:18:46,764 --> 01:18:49,891
I'm thinking that you let
the word out there knowing
he'd come down here.

1110
01:18:49,966 --> 01:18:53,163
Look, maybe
I flapped my trap at trial.
Maybe I was thinking revenge,

1111
01:18:53,237 --> 01:18:54,795
maybe talking trash
to my cellies,

1112
01:18:54,872 --> 01:18:56,737
but all I know is
what I read in the papers,

1113
01:18:56,806 --> 01:18:59,435
and when that fucker
killed them niggers...

1114
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:00,601
Finish up.

1115
01:19:00,677 --> 01:19:02,737
I don't know
what his version is.
What's your version?

1116
01:19:02,813 --> 01:19:04,576
Sir, all this between
me and Blanchard

1117
01:19:04,648 --> 01:19:07,242
is that I fucked this
big-tittied Dakota cunt
named Kay Lake...

1118
01:19:07,318 --> 01:19:08,546
Hold it, pal.

1119
01:19:38,882 --> 01:19:40,475
Blanchard, behind you!

1120
01:19:46,157 --> 01:19:47,385
Blanchard!

1121
01:20:43,346 --> 01:20:44,506
No!

1122
01:21:14,377 --> 01:21:15,367
Here.

1123
01:21:20,384 --> 01:21:22,545
My apologies,
Officer Bleichert.

1124
01:21:22,920 --> 01:21:27,413
My men are instructed
not to take any chances,
and you did have a gun.

1125
01:21:31,996 --> 01:21:33,827
The guy
with the choke rope,

1126
01:21:36,100 --> 01:21:38,466
I assume DeWitt brought him
for muscle.

1127
01:21:39,136 --> 01:21:42,902
No identification,
nothing left of his face
after he hit the fountain.

1128
01:21:42,972 --> 01:21:46,100
You understand why we must
handle things like this, huh?

1129
01:21:47,444 --> 01:21:48,911
It's your building.

1130
01:21:48,979 --> 01:21:50,344
Uh-huh.

1131
01:21:52,382 --> 01:21:54,475
Come on. Bring him in.
Get him in here.

1132
01:21:57,988 --> 01:21:59,181
Officer?

1133
01:22:01,725 --> 01:22:03,248
See what we got here?

1134
01:22:06,195 --> 01:22:08,686
I can't think of another way,
can you?

1135
01:22:10,734 --> 01:22:11,826
Come here.

1136
01:22:12,670 --> 01:22:13,796
Come on.

1137
01:22:14,438 --> 01:22:15,462
Come.

1138
01:22:36,225 --> 01:22:37,818
Want to say something?

1139
01:22:45,002 --> 01:22:46,298
Fire and Ice.

1140
01:22:52,076 --> 01:22:53,235
Fire and Ice.

1141
01:22:53,310 --> 01:22:54,640
Excuse me?

1142
01:22:58,515 --> 01:22:59,708
Nothing.

1143
01:23:04,287 --> 01:23:05,686
Just do it quick.

1144
01:23:51,734 --> 01:23:55,068
What happened?
What happened?

1145
01:23:59,710 --> 01:24:02,144
What happened?
What happened?

1146
01:24:17,694 --> 01:24:19,024
<i>Stolen witness reports,</i>

1147
01:24:19,095 --> 01:24:21,087
<i>medical records,</i>
<i>autopsy photos.</i>

1148
01:24:22,032 --> 01:24:24,193
<i>Lee had turned his life</i>
<i>inside out</i>

1149
01:24:24,435 --> 01:24:28,064
<i>and my dad's apartment</i>
<i>into the Black Dahlia's</i>
<i>House of Horrors.</i>

1150
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:32,640
<i>I confessed</i>
<i>to the only priest I needed.</i>

1151
01:24:34,411 --> 01:24:36,605
How long have you known
about this?

1152
01:24:40,050 --> 01:24:41,381
I don't know.

1153
01:24:41,819 --> 01:24:43,547
Why show me now?

1154
01:24:46,689 --> 01:24:48,088
I don't know.

1155
01:24:53,430 --> 01:24:55,556
He's not coming back,
is he, Buck?

1156
01:25:03,707 --> 01:25:05,640
Stupid son of a bitch,

1157
01:25:05,943 --> 01:25:09,708
getting himself killed
over a little mope
like Bobby DeWitt.

1158
01:25:10,279 --> 01:25:11,372
Damn.

1159
01:25:14,585 --> 01:25:15,984
Did you tell Kay?

1160
01:25:21,792 --> 01:25:25,819
Well, that's as far
as it goes, then.

1161
01:25:27,197 --> 01:25:28,788
Mo Friedman was right.

1162
01:25:29,765 --> 01:25:33,759
Our boy doesn't need
any more headlines.
Neither does Kay.

1163
01:25:35,404 --> 01:25:36,497
This...

1164
01:25:38,509 --> 01:25:40,408
I want you to
stick with me here.

1165
01:25:41,478 --> 01:25:43,639
We are going to make
something of this.

1166
01:25:43,713 --> 01:25:46,511
<i>What's a sexy girl</i>
<i>like you so sad about?</i>

1167
01:25:47,783 --> 01:25:49,011
<i>Nothing.</i>

1168
01:25:50,554 --> 01:25:53,283
<i>You've got tears</i>
<i>running down your face.</i>
<i>What's the matter with you?</i>

1169
01:25:53,356 --> 01:25:54,881
<i>Just a bad day.</i>

1170
01:25:57,194 --> 01:25:59,127
<i>It's all right.</i>
<i>You must have a lot of fun.</i>

1171
01:25:59,195 --> 01:26:01,789
<i>You look like you have</i>
<i>a hell of a lot of fun.</i>
<i>Oh, I sure do.</i>

1172
01:26:01,864 --> 01:26:03,832
<i>I'm a fun-loving gal.</i>

1173
01:26:04,333 --> 01:26:07,167
<i>You got any special guys</i>
<i>that you, you know...</i>

1174
01:26:07,604 --> 01:26:09,230
<i>I have a fianc√©.</i>

1175
01:26:10,474 --> 01:26:12,338
<i>Yeah, I met him in Florida.</i>

1176
01:26:12,743 --> 01:26:15,234
<i>And it was one</i>
<i>of those things that was...</i>

1177
01:26:16,078 --> 01:26:18,740
<i>Gosh, I don't know</i>
<i>if you've experienced</i>
<i>this before,</i>

1178
01:26:18,814 --> 01:26:20,372
<i>but it was love</i>
<i>at first sight.</i>

1179
01:26:20,449 --> 01:26:23,317
<i>Yeah, I get it</i>
<i>about five times a night.</i>

1180
01:26:25,154 --> 01:26:26,485
<i>That's what it was.</i>

1181
01:26:26,756 --> 01:26:28,782
<i>He asked me to marry him</i>
<i>that night.</i>

1182
01:26:29,458 --> 01:26:31,926
<i>And then, the next day,</i>
<i>he was just gone.</i>

1183
01:26:32,195 --> 01:26:36,064
<i>Well, that "ask you</i>
<i>to marry him" always works.</i>

1184
01:26:36,132 --> 01:26:38,533
<i>No, he promised</i>
<i>he'd come back.</i>

1185
01:26:38,601 --> 01:26:42,698
<i>He was an Air Force captain,</i>
<i>which is why he had to leave.</i>
<i>He went overseas.</i>

1186
01:26:43,273 --> 01:26:45,264
<i>And you know</i>
<i>what he used to do?</i>

1187
01:26:46,176 --> 01:26:48,804
<i>He used to write me</i>

1188
01:26:48,878 --> 01:26:52,837
<i>such beautiful, florid,</i>
<i>romantic love letters.</i>

1189
01:26:53,917 --> 01:26:55,384
<i>Oh, a poet.</i>

1190
01:26:56,019 --> 01:26:59,546
<i>Just a decent guy.</i>

1191
01:26:59,622 --> 01:27:02,989
<i>So, what happened</i>
<i>to Prince Charming?</i>

1192
01:27:10,533 --> 01:27:14,800
<i>Well, the night that</i>
<i>he was supposed to come back,</i>

1193
01:27:15,072 --> 01:27:18,166
<i>he was called to</i>
<i>do one last mission</i>

1194
01:27:18,242 --> 01:27:20,641
<i>and his plane crashed</i>

1195
01:27:23,145 --> 01:27:24,511
<i>over India.</i>

1196
01:27:26,283 --> 01:27:27,806
<i>And now he's dead.</i>

1197
01:27:30,487 --> 01:27:33,854
<i>Boy, you sure know</i>
<i>how to tell a funny story.</i>

1198
01:27:35,859 --> 01:27:37,382
<i>Yeah, I sure do.</i>

1199
01:27:40,596 --> 01:27:43,064
<i>Okay. Should I read</i>
<i>into the camera?</i>

1200
01:27:43,132 --> 01:27:44,190
<i>Yeah.</i>

1201
01:27:44,268 --> 01:27:45,256
<i>Okay.</i>

1202
01:27:49,006 --> 01:27:51,372
<i>I'm told that</i>
<i>I'm very photogenic.</i>

1203
01:27:56,779 --> 01:27:59,578
I'm collating the KA update
sheets for tomorrow.

1204
01:27:59,649 --> 01:28:01,640
Anything new
you need him to add?

1205
01:28:01,717 --> 01:28:02,912
No.

1206
01:28:03,453 --> 01:28:05,250
Dolph's tonight?

1207
01:28:05,655 --> 01:28:07,385
I'm going to Kay's.

1208
01:28:08,958 --> 01:28:12,952
Wednesday nights
were the nights she'd make
Lee and me a big dinner, so...

1209
01:28:13,162 --> 01:28:14,891
We haven't done it since.

1210
01:28:21,305 --> 01:28:22,795
We're going to try.

1211
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:38,114
Should we say something?

1212
01:28:41,891 --> 01:28:43,621
We haven't said anything.

1213
01:28:51,068 --> 01:28:52,864
To my supercops.

1214
01:28:59,509 --> 01:29:02,000
I feel like I haven't said
anything right.

1215
01:29:03,246 --> 01:29:05,145
Haven't done anything right.

1216
01:29:05,981 --> 01:29:07,471
There's nothing to say.

1217
01:29:07,551 --> 01:29:08,744
There is.

1218
01:29:11,421 --> 01:29:12,786
There is.

1219
01:29:15,926 --> 01:29:17,291
He saved my life.

1220
01:29:19,496 --> 01:29:24,489
He saved my life,
and I saw him there
and I couldn't...

1221
01:29:25,234 --> 01:29:26,395
Dwight.

1222
01:29:31,942 --> 01:29:33,533
I couldn't move.

1223
01:29:35,746 --> 01:29:37,304
I couldn't move.

1224
01:29:39,382 --> 01:29:40,747
I didn't move.

1225
01:29:43,520 --> 01:29:47,581
I never move. I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

1226
01:29:48,524 --> 01:29:50,152
Kay, I'm sorry.

1227
01:30:00,136 --> 01:30:01,502
I'm sorry.

1228
01:30:02,104 --> 01:30:05,438
I could've saved him.
I could've saved him.

1229
01:31:28,524 --> 01:31:30,515
"Shoddy home construction?"

1230
01:31:31,962 --> 01:31:34,020
I cut my foot
on a bathroom tile.

1231
01:31:34,463 --> 01:31:36,125
You got it in you
to replace a few?

1232
01:31:36,932 --> 01:31:38,297
Yeah, of course.

1233
01:32:12,234 --> 01:32:13,327
Dwight.

1234
01:32:22,479 --> 01:32:23,467
Dwight.

1235
01:32:56,078 --> 01:32:58,309
I'd always wondered
where he kept it.

1236
01:33:02,985 --> 01:33:04,976
Were you ever
going to tell me?

1237
01:33:09,492 --> 01:33:12,188
He'd given all his money
to Ben Siegel and he...

1238
01:33:13,563 --> 01:33:15,052
He wanted to buy us a home.

1239
01:33:15,131 --> 01:33:16,962
I didn't know
there was any left.

1240
01:33:21,304 --> 01:33:23,295
Were you ever
going to tell me?

1241
01:33:24,807 --> 01:33:26,365
Something's burning.

1242
01:33:35,150 --> 01:33:38,518
Bobby did do
the bank job, Dwight.
Don't get the wrong idea.

1243
01:33:38,787 --> 01:33:41,484
I don't know
what kind of idea
I got right now.

1244
01:33:47,396 --> 01:33:50,695
Things were getting really
bad between me and Bobby,
and I had to get out.

1245
01:33:50,766 --> 01:33:54,293
I knew this guy that Bobby
made me be with once.

1246
01:33:54,671 --> 01:33:56,036
He was a hophead
who let it slip

1247
01:33:56,105 --> 01:33:58,131
that he sometimes snitched
to the cops for dope money.

1248
01:33:58,207 --> 01:33:59,731
And that's how you met Lee?

1249
01:33:59,809 --> 01:34:04,109
I told him what Bobby was
doing to me, how he cut me
and pimped me to his friends

1250
01:34:04,180 --> 01:34:08,047
and I told him about
the bank job and where
Bobby was hiding the money.

1251
01:34:09,953 --> 01:34:12,512
And then last year,
the guy...

1252
01:34:12,988 --> 01:34:14,479
The hophead?

1253
01:34:14,556 --> 01:34:15,716
Yeah.

1254
01:34:17,193 --> 01:34:20,219
Lee had given him $1,000
for introducing us.

1255
01:34:22,998 --> 01:34:24,829
He found out
that Bobby was getting out,

1256
01:34:24,900 --> 01:34:27,028
and he threatened to tell him
that we stole from him.

1257
01:34:27,103 --> 01:34:28,934
He wanted money that
we didn't have, Dwight.

1258
01:34:29,238 --> 01:34:30,706
He wanted $10,000.

1259
01:34:30,774 --> 01:34:32,502
What were we going to do?

1260
01:34:33,042 --> 01:34:35,671
Promise me, promise me
you'll forgive him
for DeWitt.

1261
01:34:35,744 --> 01:34:39,010
Forgive him
for the bank. Please.
It doesn't matter to us.

1262
01:34:40,582 --> 01:34:42,778
What was the guy's name?
It doesn't matter.

1263
01:34:45,188 --> 01:34:47,019
Kay, tell me the guy's name.

1264
01:34:54,463 --> 01:34:55,896
It was Baxter Fitch.

1265
01:34:58,534 --> 01:35:00,525
<i>Baxter Fitch,</i>
<i>and then DeWitt.</i>

1266
01:35:03,139 --> 01:35:05,835
<i>Lee killed them both</i>
<i>and took the bank money,</i>

1267
01:35:06,775 --> 01:35:09,768
<i>making me witness, stooge,</i>

1268
01:35:10,680 --> 01:35:13,148
<i>weak point</i>
<i>in a fairy tale triangle.</i>

1269
01:35:13,216 --> 01:35:15,514
You're so good
at some things.

1270
01:35:17,787 --> 01:35:20,881
Dwight, he loved you.
He loved both of us,
Dwight, so much.

1271
01:35:20,957 --> 01:35:24,221
This had nothing
to do with us, Dwight!
Nothing! Don't run out on us!

1272
01:35:29,399 --> 01:35:31,890
<i>The basic rule</i>
<i>of homicide applied:</i>

1273
01:35:32,301 --> 01:35:34,462
<i>Nothing stays buried forever.</i>

1274
01:35:35,204 --> 01:35:37,935
<i>Corpses. Ghosts.</i>

1275
01:35:39,208 --> 01:35:42,872
<i>Nothing stays buried forever.</i>
<i>Nothing.</i>

1276
01:35:45,280 --> 01:35:47,248
Family's in Laguna.

1277
01:35:48,551 --> 01:35:51,110
But you know that.
You've been watching.

1278
01:35:53,756 --> 01:35:56,122
<i>Lee and Kay had lived in sin,</i>

1279
01:35:56,960 --> 01:35:59,257
<i>not because their shack job</i>
<i>was against department regs</i>

1280
01:35:59,328 --> 01:36:04,231
<i>but because the ghosts</i>
<i>of their past had forced them</i>
<i>to choose love over passion.</i>

1281
01:36:05,801 --> 01:36:07,895
<i>The veneer of a fairy tale,</i>

1282
01:36:09,271 --> 01:36:12,104
<i>only a band-aid</i>
<i>to cover a fractured life.</i>

1283
01:36:16,378 --> 01:36:18,404
<i>I didn't believe</i>
<i>in fairy tales.</i>

1284
01:36:20,048 --> 01:36:22,539
<i>It was a reunion</i>
<i>of avowed tramps,</i>

1285
01:36:23,153 --> 01:36:26,850
<i>old rutters who knew</i>
<i>they'd never have it</i>
<i>as good with anybody else.</i>

1286
01:37:36,458 --> 01:37:38,256
<i>Have you met</i>
<i>Balto in the hallway?</i>

1287
01:37:38,328 --> 01:37:40,158
<i>An old friend</i>
<i>stuffed him.</i>

1288
01:37:40,329 --> 01:37:42,797
<i>We were in the Scots Regiment</i>
<i>together. Georgie Tilden.</i>

1289
01:37:42,865 --> 01:37:44,993
<i>He wanted to work</i>
<i>in the flickers.</i>

1290
01:37:49,104 --> 01:37:50,572
What?

1291
01:37:50,640 --> 01:37:52,163
Nothing.

1292
01:37:52,708 --> 01:37:54,073
You miss them?

1293
01:37:54,409 --> 01:37:57,640
Mother's insults?
Martha's pornography?

1294
01:37:58,581 --> 01:38:00,605
I just never imagined
Georgie so...

1295
01:38:01,618 --> 01:38:03,244
The way your father
described him.

1296
01:38:04,119 --> 01:38:05,279
Different.

1297
01:38:06,588 --> 01:38:08,078
They were young.

1298
01:38:09,391 --> 01:38:11,359
He died last year. Angina.

1299
01:38:11,994 --> 01:38:15,430
Daddy paid to have him
buried at the family plot
in Scotland.

1300
01:38:18,067 --> 01:38:19,761
That's very nice of him.

1301
01:38:21,537 --> 01:38:23,333
I don't get modern art.

1302
01:38:25,173 --> 01:38:27,608
I doubt modern art
gets you, either.

1303
01:38:29,578 --> 01:38:31,069
But I do.

1304
01:38:54,737 --> 01:38:56,363
Kay, what the hell
are you doing here?

1305
01:38:56,439 --> 01:38:57,837
What am I doing here?

1306
01:38:57,907 --> 01:38:59,601
How could you?
How could you?

1307
01:38:59,676 --> 01:39:01,439
You follow me here,
after what you've done?

1308
01:39:01,511 --> 01:39:03,239
What have I done? Nothing!
You lied to me!

1309
01:39:03,313 --> 01:39:05,610
I lied for you!
I lied for us!

1310
01:39:05,681 --> 01:39:07,171
What could I do but lie,
Dwight?

1311
01:39:07,250 --> 01:39:08,581
You could have
told me the truth.

1312
01:39:08,650 --> 01:39:10,140
She looks like
that dead girl!

1313
01:39:10,653 --> 01:39:12,119
How sick are you?

1314
01:39:15,190 --> 01:39:17,681
You're going to end up
like Lee. You will.

1315
01:39:18,594 --> 01:39:20,083
But I will not.

1316
01:39:33,275 --> 01:39:36,676
<i>She looks like that</i>
<i>dead girl! How sick are you?</i>

1317
01:39:38,180 --> 01:39:40,206
<i>You're going to end up</i>
<i>like Lee.</i>

1318
01:40:14,016 --> 01:40:16,577
<i>The set</i>
<i>was enough to tie</i>
<i>Linscott to the porno movie,</i>

1319
01:40:16,652 --> 01:40:18,643
<i>but not to the murder.</i>

1320
01:40:20,256 --> 01:40:23,384
<i>For that, I needed</i>
<i>to stop worrying about</i>
<i>who killed the Dahlia</i>

1321
01:40:23,458 --> 01:40:25,051
<i>and focus on where.</i>

1322
01:40:26,561 --> 01:40:29,257
<i>Georgie</i>
<i>introduced me to Mack Sennett.</i>

1323
01:40:29,332 --> 01:40:31,231
<i>I helped him build</i>
<i>that housing project</i>
<i>he was putting up</i>

1324
01:40:31,300 --> 01:40:34,097
<i>underneath</i>
<i>that god-awful sign.</i>

1325
01:40:34,203 --> 01:40:35,601
<i>Hollywoodland.</i>

1326
01:41:33,261 --> 01:41:35,729
<i>Lorna Mertz said</i>
<i>it was shot out of town.</i>

1327
01:41:37,833 --> 01:41:39,664
<i>People lie.</i>

1328
01:41:54,550 --> 01:41:59,817
<i>Oh, a puncture wound</i>
<i>in the palm of the hand.</i>

1329
01:42:14,036 --> 01:42:18,234
<i>I say then he drained</i>
<i>the blood from the body</i>
<i>and washed it clean.</i>

1330
01:44:20,328 --> 01:44:22,024
I don't
want to go to Europe.

1331
01:44:22,097 --> 01:44:25,498
One of my foremen
said the goddamn pipes
are spewing gas.

1332
01:44:25,935 --> 01:44:27,630
There'll be hell to pay.

1333
01:44:27,802 --> 01:44:31,101
It's about time I showed
the three of you good old
Scotland.

1334
01:44:32,307 --> 01:44:34,502
I don't want to go
to Europe, Daddy.

1335
01:44:34,577 --> 01:44:37,944
You're always talking
about how dreadful
and provincial it is.

1336
01:44:38,079 --> 01:44:41,105
Yeah, but it's got
what you need, lassie.

1337
01:44:41,317 --> 01:44:42,806
What is that, Emmett?

1338
01:44:45,387 --> 01:44:46,854
Saps like me?

1339
01:44:48,323 --> 01:44:49,756
Or is that what you needed?

1340
01:44:49,824 --> 01:44:51,224
Oh, laddie.

1341
01:44:54,029 --> 01:44:55,690
You killed Elizabeth Short,

1342
01:44:56,198 --> 01:44:57,789
and the two of you
covered it up.

1343
01:44:58,868 --> 01:45:01,427
You made that stag film
with Lorna and Betty.

1344
01:45:02,637 --> 01:45:04,037
I've seen the set.

1345
01:45:05,474 --> 01:45:07,965
I found it all.
Put that gun down, laddie.

1346
01:45:08,077 --> 01:45:11,204
You're not the shooting type
and I'm not the dying type.

1347
01:45:16,018 --> 01:45:17,349
You might be half right.

1348
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:19,887
Jesus Christ, Bleichert.
That's a Ming.

1349
01:45:19,954 --> 01:45:21,512
Great. Let's talk art.

1350
01:45:21,590 --> 01:45:24,957
Let's talk <i>The Man Who Laughs</i>.
I've seen the movie.

1351
01:45:25,895 --> 01:45:27,157
I've got you.

1352
01:45:27,229 --> 01:45:28,820
So you don't
like my taste in art.

1353
01:45:28,898 --> 01:45:30,456
I don't think
that's a crime.

1354
01:45:33,502 --> 01:45:35,993
Stop! Georgie did it!

1355
01:45:38,908 --> 01:45:39,931
Oh, that's rich.

1356
01:45:40,376 --> 01:45:41,809
Blame it on the poor,
dead gardener.

1357
01:45:41,877 --> 01:45:44,368
No, Bucky. It's true.
Believe him.

1358
01:45:44,680 --> 01:45:47,171
Georgie was always sneaking
around Daddy's properties.

1359
01:45:47,248 --> 01:45:50,377
He saw them make the movie
and he got crazy about Betty.

1360
01:45:55,690 --> 01:45:56,783
More.

1361
01:45:57,592 --> 01:45:59,287
There are so many
pretty things here, Emmett.

1362
01:45:59,362 --> 01:46:00,590
All right.

1363
01:46:01,363 --> 01:46:04,060
Betty called,
short of cash, as usual.

1364
01:46:04,300 --> 01:46:07,827
I put Daddy on
and he offered her money
to date a nice man he knew.

1365
01:46:07,903 --> 01:46:09,631
You must've known
he was a sick fuck then.

1366
01:46:09,704 --> 01:46:14,005
Well, he was passive.
I mean, he liked
to touch dead things.

1367
01:46:14,076 --> 01:46:15,940
I mean,
his father was a surgeon.

1368
01:46:16,011 --> 01:46:18,411
Did you know that?
Famous in Scotland.

1369
01:46:18,480 --> 01:46:20,381
We didn't know
he'd go crazy like that.

1370
01:46:20,448 --> 01:46:21,609
Liar!

1371
01:46:22,283 --> 01:46:23,376
Liar!

1372
01:46:24,353 --> 01:46:28,220
You did him enough damage,
Emmett. Now you let him go!

1373
01:46:33,061 --> 01:46:37,795
I would appreciate it
if you just stopped shooting
things, Officer, though.

1374
01:46:38,434 --> 01:46:42,096
The rich don't own art
just for themselves.

1375
01:46:42,171 --> 01:46:45,140
We safe keep it
for future generations.

1376
01:46:45,341 --> 01:46:47,274
How did Emmett damage Georgie?

1377
01:46:48,577 --> 01:46:50,943
What did he do
to make him go so crazy?

1378
01:46:55,784 --> 01:47:00,779
Who made what made who crazy?

1379
01:47:05,828 --> 01:47:09,594
It was Madeleine.

1380
01:47:10,733 --> 01:47:12,529
She was 11 years old,

1381
01:47:15,069 --> 01:47:17,300
and she looked
just like Georgie.

1382
01:47:17,372 --> 01:47:18,396
Ramona!

1383
01:47:18,474 --> 01:47:22,466
Shut up, Emmett!

1384
01:47:27,682 --> 01:47:31,210
That's right, Officer.
George and me.

1385
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:34,814
Not that Emmett cared
about that.

1386
01:47:36,559 --> 01:47:38,652
But he was her father.

1387
01:47:39,328 --> 01:47:41,454
And for that,

1388
01:47:41,529 --> 01:47:45,021
he ruined George's face.

1389
01:47:50,372 --> 01:47:52,863
When he got out of hospital,

1390
01:47:52,942 --> 01:47:56,900
I gave him the Hugo book
as a present.

1391
01:47:57,979 --> 01:48:00,210
He had worked construction
on that movie with Emmett.

1392
01:48:00,282 --> 01:48:02,546
It was always
one of his favorites.

1393
01:48:04,453 --> 01:48:06,613
That's right. My book.

1394
01:48:07,655 --> 01:48:12,092
My picture. My Gwynplaine.

1395
01:48:14,430 --> 01:48:16,056
What about Betty Short?

1396
01:48:17,298 --> 01:48:21,667
Well, that was
the cruelest joke of all.

1397
01:48:25,807 --> 01:48:30,301
He was obsessed with her,
you know, that filthy film!

1398
01:48:33,615 --> 01:48:36,015
<i>And your husband</i>
<i>bought her for Georgie.</i>

1399
01:48:38,020 --> 01:48:40,579
He's a shy wee lad,
but I...

1400
01:48:40,989 --> 01:48:44,390
It'd make him very happy,
I think, if you'd take him
out on a wee date.

1401
01:48:44,627 --> 01:48:46,322
<i>What did you do,</i>
<i>Ramona?</i>

1402
01:48:48,329 --> 01:48:50,820
<i>I was</i>

1403
01:48:50,899 --> 01:48:54,926
<i>waiting up in Hollywoodland.</i>

1404
01:48:55,470 --> 01:48:56,698
Oh, gosh.

1405
01:49:15,724 --> 01:49:19,887
It was the second swing,

1406
01:49:19,962 --> 01:49:21,554
woke her up.

1407
01:49:22,965 --> 01:49:26,525
<i>She looked so like my Maddy.</i>

1408
01:49:27,670 --> 01:49:28,829
<i>It was</i>

1409
01:49:29,805 --> 01:49:34,640
<i>the cruelest joke of all.</i>

1410
01:49:48,222 --> 01:49:50,555
We'll ruin you in court.
You know that.

1411
01:49:50,626 --> 01:49:53,493
Over what? Some little slut?

1412
01:50:10,212 --> 01:50:14,011
<i>It was</i>
<i>neat enough for the papers,</i>
<i>but that didn't make it clean.</i>

1413
01:50:14,248 --> 01:50:18,015
<i>The rich lived differently.</i>
<i>I guess they get</i>
<i>to die differently, too.</i>

1414
01:51:01,796 --> 01:51:03,525
Hello, Officer Bleichert.

1415
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:07,627
Did you come to pay your
respects or fuck my sister?

1416
01:51:07,703 --> 01:51:10,194
I came to talk to you
about Lee Blanchard.

1417
01:51:11,707 --> 01:51:15,336
He came here, didn't he?
Asking about your sister
and the Dahlia?

1418
01:51:21,382 --> 01:51:22,610
Tell me.

1419
01:51:40,703 --> 01:51:43,001
<i>Adios</i> yourself back
to the Halls of Tripoli,
shitbird.

1420
01:51:43,072 --> 01:51:45,096
I've got business
with the lady.

1421
01:51:57,286 --> 01:51:58,479
Bucky.

1422
01:51:59,287 --> 01:52:02,121
Lee knew everything about you
and Elizabeth Short.

1423
01:52:03,225 --> 01:52:04,783
He knew everything,
didn't he?

1424
01:52:04,859 --> 01:52:06,953
I don't know
what you're saying.

1425
01:52:07,996 --> 01:52:11,295
I went by your house today.
I talked to your sister,
Martha.

1426
01:52:12,533 --> 01:52:15,765
She told me that a policeman
named Lee Blanchard came by
the house

1427
01:52:15,837 --> 01:52:18,533
asking questions about
you and Elizabeth Short.

1428
01:52:22,810 --> 01:52:25,574
She told him that
the two of you were close.

1429
01:52:26,914 --> 01:52:29,314
Martha was always
jealous of me.

1430
01:52:29,984 --> 01:52:31,475
He was blackmailing
your father.

1431
01:52:41,863 --> 01:52:44,354
No. I beat up a wall.
For messing up Nash...

1432
01:52:44,466 --> 01:52:45,728
So,

1433
01:52:49,238 --> 01:52:51,729
on the night that
he went to the Olympic
to settle an old score

1434
01:52:51,806 --> 01:52:55,470
<i>you tracked him there.</i>
<i>Like a dog.</i>

1435
01:53:10,492 --> 01:53:13,551
I've been pointing my gun
at a lot of people this week.

1436
01:53:14,962 --> 01:53:17,488
I haven't had a chance
to shoot anybody yet.

1437
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:19,529
What do you think?

1438
01:53:19,600 --> 01:53:22,034
I think you'd rather fuck me
than kill me,

1439
01:53:24,605 --> 01:53:27,073
but you don't have
the guts to do either.

1440
01:53:30,645 --> 01:53:33,637
You're a boxer, not a fighter.

1441
01:53:33,715 --> 01:53:35,238
You're a murderer.

1442
01:53:36,551 --> 01:53:37,644
Of my partner.

1443
01:53:37,719 --> 01:53:39,185
A murderer?

1444
01:53:41,722 --> 01:53:43,452
Of Lee Blanchard?

1445
01:53:47,930 --> 01:53:50,454
You should thank me
for Lee Blanchard.

1446
01:53:51,365 --> 01:53:52,423
If it weren't for me,

1447
01:53:52,501 --> 01:53:54,059
you wouldn't
have had the balls

1448
01:53:54,136 --> 01:53:56,036
to fuck your partner's girl.

1449
01:53:56,904 --> 01:53:58,930
You don't talk
about them, okay?

1450
01:53:59,240 --> 01:54:03,541
Wait. I forgot.

1451
01:54:07,015 --> 01:54:09,176
You don't fuck her anymore

1452
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:14,481
because you'd rather
fuck me.

1453
01:54:15,623 --> 01:54:17,353
You don't talk about them.

1454
01:54:19,094 --> 01:54:22,494
You chose me over her.

1455
01:54:23,265 --> 01:54:26,324
You'll choose me over him.

1456
01:54:28,837 --> 01:54:31,533
He was going to take
Daddy's money and leave,

1457
01:54:32,908 --> 01:54:34,306
leave all of you.

1458
01:54:45,854 --> 01:54:47,719
You'd never shoot me.

1459
01:54:50,725 --> 01:54:52,886
Don't forget who I look like.

1460
01:54:53,996 --> 01:54:56,623
Because that girl,

1461
01:54:56,698 --> 01:55:00,759
that sad, dead bitch,

1462
01:55:02,637 --> 01:55:04,730
she's all you have.

1463
01:55:07,743 --> 01:55:08,835
No.

1464
01:55:42,344 --> 01:55:45,574
<i>Madeleine was wrong.</i>
<i>I had others.</i>

1465
01:55:47,381 --> 01:55:49,747
<i>Ones I'd loved</i>
<i>and ones who'd loved me.</i>

1466
01:55:51,853 --> 01:55:56,221
<i>People I'd betrayed and people</i>
<i>I needed to protect.</i>

1467
01:55:57,091 --> 01:55:59,185
<i>And, for the first time</i>
<i>in my life,</i>

1468
01:55:59,994 --> 01:56:03,725
<i>I had people that knew that,</i>
<i>for the briefest of times,</i>

1469
01:56:04,699 --> 01:56:06,327
<i>in the darkest of places,</i>

1470
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:10,427
<i>I had been so,</i>
<i>so good at some things.</i>

1471
01:56:50,278 --> 01:56:51,711
Come inside.
