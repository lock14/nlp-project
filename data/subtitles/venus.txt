1
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:19,238
- <i>Shall we?</i>
- <i>We shall.</i>

2
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:26,676
Oh, my God.
Now what have I got today?

3
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:29,915
Oh. Mmm.

4
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,716
You should try these.
You'll never wake up.

5
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:36,261
It's the waking up pills I'm looking for.

6
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:39,354
Anything blue, I recommend for that.

7
00:01:39,732 --> 00:01:42,394
White ones give me more of a thrill.

8
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:43,727
Mmm.

9
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:46,237
- Cheers.
- There we are.

10
00:01:46,339 --> 00:01:50,070
"Do not operate heavy machinery.

11
00:01:50,176 --> 00:01:52,542
"Keep away from children."

12
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,443
Biblical advice.

13
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:55,912
There you go, gentlemen.

14
00:01:56,015 --> 00:01:58,415
- Thank you.
- Excellent, my dear.

15
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:03,052
- Have you got my glasses?
- No, you've got them.

16
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:07,025
Why would I have them?
I'm not wearing them, am I?

17
00:02:07,093 --> 00:02:09,186
Christ, I've lost them now!

18
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:11,287
That's the worst thing
that's ever happened...

19
00:02:11,397 --> 00:02:13,592
They're in your right hand.

20
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:16,261
Oh, yeah.

21
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:19,031
You wouldn't last five minutes
without me.

22
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:20,265
I'm getting help.

23
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:22,864
- Professional?
- My niece's girl.

24
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:28,240
<i>Have you worked out</i>
<i>what the girl will actually do?</i>

25
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:31,112
She'll shop and cook for me.

26
00:02:31,217 --> 00:02:33,947
- A sort of nurse, then?
- No uniform.

27
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:37,487
Don't give yourself a coronary.

28
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:43,620
At the hospital they said
if I'm clear in five years, I'm safe.

29
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:48,893
I said,
"By then I'll be drinking with Jesus."

30
00:02:48,968 --> 00:02:52,096
He's looking forward to meeting you.
He loved your Polonius.

31
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,766
But he found your Caesar a little weak.

32
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,968
- Weak?
- A little...

33
00:02:57,076 --> 00:02:58,236
- What?
- ...fruity.

34
00:02:58,311 --> 00:03:02,304
No, he fucking didn't.
Did he? Fruity?

35
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:05,976
What the fuck? Fruity! Fucking fruit.

36
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,320
I'm parched.
How about a drink?

37
00:03:09,422 --> 00:03:13,085
This isn't a pub.
I've got to get her room ready.

38
00:03:13,626 --> 00:03:15,355
Can I help?

39
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,587
God, no.

40
00:03:16,663 --> 00:03:20,155
No, don't flap it about like that,
Maurice.

41
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:22,658
I'm getting wind rash.

42
00:03:23,303 --> 00:03:27,706
- I'll tuck it in, you'll tire yourself.
- She'll suffocate in there.

43
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:31,265
There's no reason for her
to move around unnecessarily at night.

44
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:35,144
- Not unless she needs to attend to me.
- In what way?

45
00:03:35,949 --> 00:03:38,679
I've bought a little bell
to put beside my bed.

46
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,486
If I feel unwell, I can tinkle it. See?

47
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:49,151
I bet she can't wait
to hear that little tinkle.

48
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,823
I've bought her a pink towel, too.

49
00:03:51,898 --> 00:03:54,765
So there's no confusion
in the bathroom.

50
00:03:54,867 --> 00:03:57,097
No, you wouldn't want that.

51
00:03:58,504 --> 00:03:59,732
No.

52
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:05,207
And in case she wants
something to read, I got her these.

53
00:04:06,012 --> 00:04:08,344
Fucking Edith Wharton.

54
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:11,042
I really want to educate the girl,
Maurice.

55
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:12,778
Pass something on.

56
00:04:12,885 --> 00:04:14,352
Yes, dear.

57
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:17,514
She loves music.

58
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,788
While we're eating, I thought we could
listen to the St. Matthew Passion.

59
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:23,020
Lovely.

60
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:27,396
No doubt it'll be tomato soup
and a temazepam for you.

61
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:28,559
No doubt.

62
00:04:28,635 --> 00:04:31,035
Shall I get her to run a nice bath

63
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:34,369
and put my dressing-gown
on the radiator?

64
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:38,873
I hope she can do a rocket salad.

65
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:42,308
Or something interesting with fish.

66
00:04:49,989 --> 00:04:52,753
Going anywhere
nice for the holidays?

67
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:58,630
- Where?
- Piranha fish.

68
00:04:58,731 --> 00:05:00,460
Fantastic.

69
00:05:00,566 --> 00:05:03,660
Right, Maurice,
deep breath for me now.

70
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:05,260
And, there we go.

71
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:11,802
Easy but not necessarily nice.
Uncomfortable? That's quite normal.

72
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,811
Feel the same myself.

73
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:18,272
Everything all right otherwise?
Life treating you well?

74
00:05:18,351 --> 00:05:20,751
- Jesus Christ.
- Good.

75
00:05:22,855 --> 00:05:27,485
The prostate should feel like a peach
with a groove down the center.

76
00:05:27,593 --> 00:05:28,821
Yours is a little bumpy.

77
00:05:28,928 --> 00:05:31,522
There might be a small nodule in there,
but it could easily be nothing.

78
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,498
So we need to send you to a specialist.

79
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:38,496
A lot of older men have this problem.
It rarely kills them.

80
00:05:38,604 --> 00:05:41,129
They die of something else first.

81
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,103
Right.

82
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:46,202
So you should worry a little
but not a lot.

83
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:47,939
Now then...

84
00:05:48,481 --> 00:05:51,348
Not after last year.
I made that quite clear.

85
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:52,509
Good on you.

86
00:05:52,618 --> 00:05:55,610
In the end, there was
such a stream of... You know.

87
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,782
- Really?
- Yeah. Coming and going, and all that.

88
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,655
I felt like standing outside
and shouting,

89
00:06:00,727 --> 00:06:02,319
"Another warm body for my friend."

90
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,363
- You should have done.
- Yeah, I know. Excuse me.

91
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,955
That's fine. All done. Can you put
your finger on that, please?

92
00:06:07,033 --> 00:06:08,227
Hello. How are we today?

93
00:06:19,412 --> 00:06:22,074
Come on, old man!

94
00:06:53,946 --> 00:06:56,710
- <i>Thank Christ you're here.</i>
- <i>What's up?</i>

95
00:06:57,784 --> 00:07:03,154
Horrible, horrible, foul
and vile beyond belief.

96
00:07:03,723 --> 00:07:05,315
What an upset.

97
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,156
Was the bath too cold
or the towel too hot?

98
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:15,064
- Was the fish overcooked?
- Fish? Fish? Fish?

99
00:07:15,134 --> 00:07:18,331
I'd have been lucky to get a fish finger

100
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:21,635
inserted into my rectum.

101
00:07:21,741 --> 00:07:23,834
- Good God!
- God, Maurice.

102
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:25,137
What's gone wrong?

103
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:30,807
It's hardly been 24 hours,
already I'm screaming for euthanasia.

104
00:07:45,965 --> 00:07:48,365
- Shouldn't you be getting ready?
- For what?

105
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,992
The theater.

106
00:07:50,603 --> 00:07:53,037
Oh, God, yes.

107
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,801
Yes. Let's leave immediately.

108
00:07:57,844 --> 00:07:59,641
I'll just change.

109
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:06,515
Let's hope it's a long play.

110
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:11,688
You've never said that before.

111
00:08:45,091 --> 00:08:46,649
I'm Maurice.

112
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:51,227
Maurice.

113
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:54,393
You?

114
00:08:56,569 --> 00:08:57,763
Can I?

115
00:09:00,439 --> 00:09:05,399
You will find I usually
call around this time, for a little drinkie.

116
00:09:06,579 --> 00:09:10,379
I like whiskey with a whisker of water.

117
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:14,078
No more than a whisker, mind you.
That ruins it.

118
00:09:15,087 --> 00:09:17,055
It's called "drowning."

119
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,758
Drowning.

120
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:25,062
Do you know how to mix drinks?

121
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:29,399
Once acquired,
it's a talent that will serve you for life.

122
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:32,371
Like typing.

123
00:09:41,447 --> 00:09:45,543
So, what are you doing?

124
00:09:46,719 --> 00:09:50,621
- In London, I mean.
- Looking for work.

125
00:09:50,723 --> 00:09:54,022
- What sort of work?
- Work.

126
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:58,359
- You know, work.
- Yes, yes, I know all about it.

127
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,830
Any particular kind?

128
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:05,165
- Modeling.
- There can't be much call for that.

129
00:10:05,805 --> 00:10:07,966
- Call for what?
- Yodeling.

130
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,977
Not yodeling! Yodeling?
Modeling! You know.

131
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,677
You know anyone
in the modeling field?

132
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:22,219
Yes. I know everyone.

133
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:28,185
Do you have a fallback position?

134
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,221
No.

135
00:10:31,497 --> 00:10:33,522
- No, I don't need one.
- Right.

136
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:37,125
- Are you saying I do?
- No. I wouldn't say that.

137
00:10:39,372 --> 00:10:41,465
- No.
- No? Good.

138
00:10:48,214 --> 00:10:52,674
I'm thirsty now. Can I have a beer?
I told him to get me some in.

139
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:56,313
- What did he say?
- He said it were a slippery slope.

140
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:03,553
Oh!

141
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:21,206
Ian?

142
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:31,382
<i>It won't be as good as</i>
Celebrity Love Island,

143
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:32,788
<i>but it will be live.</i>

144
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:35,556
- Live?
- You might enjoy it.

145
00:11:46,739 --> 00:11:50,140
- Can't we go and see <i>Lion King</i>?
- What a good idea.

146
00:11:51,977 --> 00:11:55,140
- Come on, you minger!
- What a mess you've made.

147
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:56,714
Oh, God!

148
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:58,944
No!

149
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,052
No, no!

150
00:12:02,121 --> 00:12:05,420
Stupid cunt. You're in the
biggest trouble of your life.

151
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:06,924
Come on.

152
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:10,926
Don't make me stand here on my own,
you cunts!

153
00:12:11,597 --> 00:12:13,326
I can't stand it.

154
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:18,801
- Come with us.
- Now I've got no one.

155
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,633
Get a minder.

156
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:23,675
I so loved you in the Dickens
the other night.

157
00:12:23,776 --> 00:12:25,107
You noticed me?

158
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:29,580
Don't be silly, of course I did.
You were very funny and clever.

159
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:31,081
Thank you.

160
00:12:31,817 --> 00:12:34,342
- Jillian?
- Yeah, Jillian.

161
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:42,489
- You're famous?
- A little bit.

162
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:45,086
- What's your name again?
- Maurice.

163
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,593
Maurice Russell.

164
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:49,601
Oh, right.

165
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,633
Isn't it the end?

166
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,107
It's never the end
when you go to the theater, I'm afraid.

167
00:12:58,177 --> 00:13:01,078
- Come on.
- Are you taking me somewhere?

168
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:04,272
- Yeah.
- How wonderful.

169
00:13:08,521 --> 00:13:11,684
- I'll have a Bacardi Breezer.
- Me, too.

170
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,919
- What is it?
- It's red.

171
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,993
Oh, good.

172
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:19,996
Like wine?

173
00:13:20,099 --> 00:13:21,361
Is it?

174
00:13:24,603 --> 00:13:26,833
Getting on well with Uncle Ian?

175
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:30,466
- Do you know anything about fish?
- Fuck all, my dear.

176
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,841
- You?
- Fuck all.

177
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:37,681
- You could consult a book.
- A book?

178
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:42,482
Yeah, you know, two flaps of cardboard
with printed pages in between.

179
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:47,554
- Do you read a lot?
- Only when there's no one to talk to.

180
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:55,131
That went down a treat. Another?

181
00:14:00,706 --> 00:14:03,698
- I'll let you get me one more.
- Oh, thank you.

182
00:14:05,311 --> 00:14:06,573
Excuse me.

183
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,340
I think you're sweating on me.
I think it's gone in me mouth.

184
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:14,409
- I'm sure you've swallowed worse.
- Oh, shit.

185
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,983
I think I'm gonna be sick.

186
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:07,237
Come on. Come on, Jessie.

187
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:08,739
Nearly there.

188
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,133
There you go.

189
00:15:44,843 --> 00:15:47,903
Oh, fuck! Jesus!

190
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:54,251
- Dad? Dad. Don't leave us.
- He's going. He's going.

191
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,187
No. Goodbye. Goodbye.

192
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,847
Goodbye, Dad.

193
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:00,856
And cut.

194
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,022
- Very good.
- All right, thanks, everybody.

195
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:22,380
- Are you okay?
- I think I'm going to die.

196
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:26,679
You can't die yet, Maurice, we haven't
shot them carrying the body out yet.

197
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,025
Hello, mate.

198
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,188
Here you are, Mr. Russell,
as requested.

199
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:42,164
Thanks, old chap.

200
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:45,203
And may I take some of these cakes?

201
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:47,738
Sure, why not?
I'll pack some up for you.

202
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,307
Thank you.

203
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,158
I'm in such pain, dear,
I don't want to live.

204
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,754
Yes, you do.

205
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,925
Almost all of us want you to live.

206
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,674
I have to have an operation.

207
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,537
- What is it?
- Prostate.

208
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:35,079
- I'm sure it's just routine.
- Maurice, I'm so sorry.

209
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:40,051
You've always wanted
to remove my balls surgically.

210
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,525
These cakes are awfully nice.

211
00:17:44,029 --> 00:17:45,360
Action.

212
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,726
Bravo.

213
00:17:48,801 --> 00:17:52,635
I've been at it like a dog all day.
I'm utterly broken.

214
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:55,468
- What were you playing?
- A corpse, more or less.

215
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,235
Typecast again.

216
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:06,213
Here. I asked them for cash.

217
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:08,817
Well, not all of it.

218
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,551
Please, take it.

219
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:14,956
Put it towards the boiler,
it gets cold in here.

220
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,232
The whole thing's useless.

221
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:27,800
It's all got to be replaced, Maurice,
the radiators, everything.

222
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:32,073
- The man came yesterday.
- I owe you thousands.

223
00:18:34,146 --> 00:18:38,606
Over the years,
you've been more than generous.

224
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:41,175
- I haven't forgotten.
- No.

225
00:18:43,021 --> 00:18:45,421
Can't the children contribute?

226
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:48,654
Can't we look after ourselves
in our old age?

227
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,109
- Sammy's gone.
- He has?

228
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:07,975
- Yeah.
- Christ.

229
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:10,776
Big picture of him here
as a handsome young spunker.

230
00:19:10,849 --> 00:19:13,340
- Another one down.
- Yeah.

231
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,648
I wonder how many lines I'll get?

232
00:19:19,892 --> 00:19:21,359
A paragraph.

233
00:19:23,629 --> 00:19:25,563
Lo, here comes Caesar.

234
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:27,329
And moving rather rapidly

235
00:19:27,399 --> 00:19:30,800
for someone who's just picked up
his disability check.

236
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:33,335
Oh, God.

237
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:36,000
- Hello, love.
- Hello, Donald.

238
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:38,406
Thank Christ she's asleep now.

239
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,310
She's drunk all my best Stoli
and the Scotch!

240
00:19:42,381 --> 00:19:47,614
She even put away the Drambuie
I was saving for your Christmas visit.

241
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,551
God, no?

242
00:19:49,655 --> 00:19:53,113
I bought this lovely bit
of halibut yesterday,

243
00:19:53,192 --> 00:19:55,023
but she didn't know what to do with it.

244
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,185
Dear Jesus.

245
00:19:56,295 --> 00:20:02,859
Her notion of cooking is to stick a plate
of virtual sick into the microwave.

246
00:20:02,968 --> 00:20:05,402
- Well, can't you call the police?
- That's a very good idea.

247
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,734
Oh, or just kill them, kill the young.

248
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:10,831
Exterminate their disgusting happiness
and hope.

249
00:20:10,909 --> 00:20:15,471
This is not fucking funny!
I've got high blood pressure.

250
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:18,482
I could die at any moment.

251
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:22,816
- Why doesn't she just go back home?
- I rang my niece. I begged her.

252
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:24,913
I wept more than Antigone.

253
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:28,720
I said I'd pay for the taxi
to wherever, you know.

254
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:32,354
Martha said there is no job
in the countryside.

255
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:34,991
There must be some demand
for barmaids and prostitutes.

256
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:39,697
Yeah, I mean, even in the country
they need young women to lap dance.

257
00:20:39,771 --> 00:20:41,329
- What? What?
- What do you know about that?

258
00:20:41,406 --> 00:20:42,737
You can learn a lot from the television.

259
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:46,538
Look, the fact is
Martha just doesn't want her back.

260
00:20:46,612 --> 00:20:49,581
But to unleash her on us like this,
you know.

261
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,410
- Maliciously.
- Exactly.

262
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:54,076
- It's pure evil.
- Of course it is.

263
00:20:54,186 --> 00:20:56,848
- Evil.
- Did your niece do it deliberately?

264
00:20:56,922 --> 00:21:00,187
What? What?
You men are laughing at me.

265
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:04,426
- Let's think about this collectively.
- Yeah, please, please, please.

266
00:21:04,529 --> 00:21:06,520
- Thank you.
- We hate to see you suffer, Ian.

267
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:10,466
Oh, please, Maurice,
you're fond of women, all women,

268
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:13,697
and you're resourceful. Help me.

269
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:16,366
You couldn't have come
to a better man.

270
00:21:16,441 --> 00:21:18,466
A scientist of the female heart.

271
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:21,102
- A professor of pussy.
- That's it.

272
00:21:21,213 --> 00:21:24,979
Fucking shut it, Donald!
You're really getting on my nerves!

273
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,950
"Fucking shut it, Donald!
You're really getting on my nerves!"

274
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,715
- Fucking shut it.
- Fucking shut it!

275
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:38,088
- He's at doctors.
- Good.

276
00:21:38,764 --> 00:21:39,822
What?

277
00:21:39,931 --> 00:21:42,991
<i>After scouring the earth</i>
<i>on your behalf, Jessie,</i>

278
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:45,399
<i>I'm here to announce</i>
<i>I've got you a job.</i>

279
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:49,240
- Liar.
- It's true. Modeling.

280
00:21:50,742 --> 00:21:53,438
- You've done that?
- Yeah. Pleased?

281
00:21:54,413 --> 00:21:58,008
- I said you could rely on me.
- Well, what sort of clothes is it?

282
00:21:58,116 --> 00:21:59,947
Do you think I'll get to keep them
at the end?

283
00:22:00,018 --> 00:22:02,646
- I'm not sure about that.
- Why not?

284
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:06,355
There's no actual clothes involved.

285
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:09,084
What? None at all?

286
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,528
No. Not as such. No.

287
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:16,624
No clothes. None at all.

288
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:19,167
You're having me do a porno?

289
00:22:19,271 --> 00:22:21,603
I'm not letting anyone I know
see me chuffs and bumps.

290
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,300
- It's not like that.
- What's it like then?

291
00:22:23,375 --> 00:22:26,105
- You'll see.
- You better not be trying to corrupt me.

292
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:28,442
I am shocked, Jessie,
that you would think of me like this.

293
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:30,174
I am a respectable and respected man.

294
00:22:30,282 --> 00:22:31,476
Oh, yeah, right.

295
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:34,542
"Chuffs and bumps."
I've never heard that before.

296
00:22:34,653 --> 00:22:37,486
- Now you're thinking about it!
- I'm not, I promise.

297
00:22:37,556 --> 00:22:40,389
- You think about summat else.
- I shall.

298
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,626
Jesus.

299
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:52,203
Well, when do I start?

300
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,171
Don't keep touching me!

301
00:22:57,142 --> 00:22:59,303
For a moment there
I thought my legs might go.

302
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,141
That's no reason to cling on.

303
00:23:01,213 --> 00:23:04,148
Just let yourself fall to the ground
natural-like.

304
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,649
Thank you.

305
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,991
I can't do it
with anyone I know watching.

306
00:23:18,063 --> 00:23:19,928
You've got to be professional, my dear.

307
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:22,261
- But I'm nervous.
- So am I.

308
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:27,498
- I am frightened, okay?
- Mr. Russell, if you don't mind...

309
00:23:27,572 --> 00:23:30,871
- What?
- Could you, please...

310
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:42,913
Thank you and goodnight.

311
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:32,600
Everything all right?

312
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:35,064
<i>You won't be able</i>
<i>to do it if you can't relax</i>

313
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,437
<i>and let people look at you.</i>

314
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:42,680
It's the human form, as it is,
naked, in its weakness and beauty.

315
00:24:43,148 --> 00:24:44,513
Oh, yeah?

316
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:48,181
What would your mother say?

317
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,679
She says if I weren't born,
she'd be better off.

318
00:24:54,259 --> 00:24:56,352
- Is this it?
- This is it.

319
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,337
There.

320
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,309
You see?

321
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:18,012
- Is her name Venus?
- No.

322
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:21,015
Venus is a goddess.

323
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,349
Accompanied by Eros,

324
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:26,117
she creates love and desire
in us mortals

325
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:30,150
leading often
to foolishness and despair.

326
00:25:30,228 --> 00:25:31,957
The usual shit.

327
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:35,864
For most men,

328
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:40,834
a woman's body is the
most beautiful thing they will ever see.

329
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:46,402
What's the most beautiful thing
a girl sees?

330
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,345
Do you know?

331
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,311
Her first child.

332
00:25:57,689 --> 00:25:59,384
Are you all right?

333
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,754
I'm not doing any more
of that modeling, I can tell you that.

334
00:26:02,861 --> 00:26:05,261
The model for Venus
was a real woman, just like you,

335
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:07,923
that's what caused all the fuss.

336
00:26:08,033 --> 00:26:09,694
Do a bit then.

337
00:26:09,768 --> 00:26:12,168
- Now?
- If you're so good at it.

338
00:26:14,706 --> 00:26:20,110
"Is this a dagger which I see before me,
The handle toward my hand?

339
00:26:20,679 --> 00:26:23,944
"Come, let me clutch thee:

340
00:26:24,049 --> 00:26:26,347
"I have thee not,
and yet I see thee still."

341
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:30,081
- Now, tell me, who wrote that?
- I don't know.

342
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:31,951
Really?

343
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:35,356
All right then, smart-arse,
what about this?

344
00:26:35,427 --> 00:26:38,419
"I should be so lucky,
lucky, lucky, lucky.

345
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:40,293
"I should be so lucky."

346
00:26:40,398 --> 00:26:42,866
Well? Who wrote it?

347
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:46,097
- Not a clue.
- Well, there you are then.

348
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,806
Hey,
it's like a beach down there.

349
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,976
I lived by the sea when I was a child.

350
00:27:01,152 --> 00:27:03,052
It always calms me.

351
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:09,487
Shall we go to the seaside, Venus?

352
00:27:09,594 --> 00:27:11,721
I'd rather go to Topshop.

353
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,631
I'll take you to lunch.

354
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:19,101
- Take me somewhere posh.
- Posh?

355
00:27:19,170 --> 00:27:22,298
I want to meet someone
really famous, not just you.

356
00:27:24,843 --> 00:27:26,333
Who are these bastards?

357
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:29,572
Some of these arseholes
were very well-known.

358
00:27:29,648 --> 00:27:32,913
- For what?
- You cheer me up, you know.

359
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:34,815
- You have a laugh at me, don't you?
- Just a little.

360
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,511
- I'll get you back.
- You will.

361
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:38,316
Don't you worry.

362
00:27:46,297 --> 00:27:47,924
Keep still.

363
00:27:48,466 --> 00:27:51,765
- It's not surgery.
- I don't trust you.

364
00:27:54,706 --> 00:27:57,436
Got it. A palpable hit.

365
00:27:57,509 --> 00:27:59,943
But where has the little fucker gone?

366
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,172
Who cares? It's free now.

367
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,681
I can't have my home
scattered with toenails.

368
00:28:05,784 --> 00:28:09,345
Oh, God.
I'll have to get my other glasses.

369
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:12,184
They're around your fucking neck.

370
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,349
Oh, thank you.

371
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,927
Where's that bastard toenail?

372
00:28:19,164 --> 00:28:21,928
There's the little fucker.

373
00:28:24,035 --> 00:28:25,434
How's Valerie?

374
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:28,336
Phoning me continuously
with complaints.

375
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,940
You're her husband.

376
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,034
- Am I?
- Yeah.

377
00:28:33,144 --> 00:28:36,807
You did one of your runners,
if you remember.

378
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,178
Did I?

379
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:42,213
But I never wanted to be independent.

380
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,810
I love it.

381
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:51,526
I am about to die
and I know nothing about myself.

382
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:57,330
You have been loved, though, Maurice.

383
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:01,461
- You've been adored.
- Yes.

384
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:06,702
And so have you, Ian, a little bit.

385
00:29:07,512 --> 00:29:10,174
Except you didn't always notice it.

386
00:29:13,685 --> 00:29:16,347
God, my bloody back!

387
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:24,060
No, you can't cling to me like this, Ian,
we'll both go down.

388
00:29:24,162 --> 00:29:27,029
Put me on my feet then,
you silly old fool!

389
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,328
You're on your feet.

390
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,369
- Oh. Yeah, well, thank you.
- Not at all.

391
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:51,446
To keep the little minx away from you,

392
00:29:51,556 --> 00:29:54,684
I'm going to sacrifice my day
by taking her shopping.

393
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:58,286
- Marvelous.
- But I'll need 20 quid for refreshments.

394
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:02,363
- Done.
- Good boy. What are you going to do?

395
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:06,563
I need to lie down.
She's exhausted me.

396
00:30:06,638 --> 00:30:09,368
I'm going to have a pre-nap nap.

397
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,773
- Where is she?
- Dead, I'm sure of it.

398
00:30:12,877 --> 00:30:14,777
Are you absolutely certain?

399
00:30:14,879 --> 00:30:18,474
There will be no sign of life
for several hours.

400
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:35,462
Don't do that.

401
00:30:40,238 --> 00:30:42,172
Coming with me today?

402
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:47,771
You want me to?

403
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,116
Okay.

404
00:30:58,156 --> 00:30:59,646
Get up then.

405
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:02,922
I haven't got anything to wear.

406
00:31:02,994 --> 00:31:07,021
I can't think of anything more enraging,
my dear.

407
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,860
- If you try and look at me, I'll...
- Look?

408
00:31:43,968 --> 00:31:46,664
I am losing the will to live, Venus.

409
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:49,730
I'll rip your eyes out
and stick them up your arse!

410
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:02,915
Does it suit me?

411
00:32:04,155 --> 00:32:05,315
Yes.

412
00:32:08,192 --> 00:32:09,557
Oh, yes.

413
00:32:11,062 --> 00:32:12,586
In what way?

414
00:32:13,364 --> 00:32:15,332
In all possible ways.

415
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,403
It goes with your...

416
00:32:21,172 --> 00:32:23,663
- What?
- Nail varnish.

417
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:28,208
I'm not wearing nail varnish.

418
00:32:31,249 --> 00:32:32,841
It's beautiful.

419
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:41,753
Next?

420
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,729
Hello there. It's lovely, isn't it?

421
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,960
Maurice, thank you.

422
00:32:49,067 --> 00:32:51,092
How will you be paying, sir?

423
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:52,965
Oh, yes, right.

424
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:07,980
- What's that?
- One of Uncle Ian's toenail clippings.

425
00:33:08,086 --> 00:33:09,883
Oh, my God!

426
00:33:09,954 --> 00:33:13,617
Otherwise, I'm afraid, I've only got a 20.

427
00:33:15,126 --> 00:33:16,320
Next?

428
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:19,925
Jessie?

429
00:33:21,899 --> 00:33:23,230
Jessie!

430
00:33:25,603 --> 00:33:27,468
You humiliated me!

431
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,607
- That will teach you!
- But weren't we gonna have lunch?

432
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:37,114
I never wanna see you again!
Now I can never go back into that shop!

433
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:08,170
- You ready?
- Christ!

434
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:12,006
- Will it hurt?
- Only if you struggle.

435
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:14,107
Come on now.

436
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,382
Now this might be a bit cold.

437
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:19,316
It's all right.

438
00:34:20,958 --> 00:34:22,653
Now just relax.

439
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:25,218
Jesus!

440
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:28,890
Everything all right here?
Now, I've done hundreds of these.

441
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,128
There's a strong chance
of impotence and incontinence.

442
00:34:32,203 --> 00:34:35,070
But you won't be dead
and that is a result.

443
00:34:35,173 --> 00:34:37,664
Okay, let's get him to theater.

444
00:34:40,678 --> 00:34:44,170
- Here we go.
- I've always liked the theater.

445
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:51,855
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Oh, you know.

446
00:34:52,857 --> 00:34:55,348
I didn't want to think about it.

447
00:34:56,661 --> 00:34:58,891
I hate sympathy.

448
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:01,988
But you wouldn't have got any from me.

449
00:35:02,066 --> 00:35:05,866
- I know. You're a true friend.
- Yes.

450
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:09,005
How's the nurse?

451
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:12,600
It's agony. I told her to be on her way.

452
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:17,542
- Where will she go?
- That's up to her.

453
00:35:19,016 --> 00:35:22,577
They always need people in Africa,
I hear.

454
00:35:25,189 --> 00:35:27,749
It hardly seems worth going home.

455
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:43,900
Why not? I am a free man!

456
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,602
We just wouldn't recommend it,
that's all.

457
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:47,371
Not for someone so soon
after an operation.

458
00:35:47,445 --> 00:35:49,242
Why don't you wait to see the doctor?

459
00:35:49,313 --> 00:35:51,144
Because there are people
I need to see!

460
00:35:51,249 --> 00:35:53,649
- Well, can't they come here?
- No!

461
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:13,334
- Hello.
- Hello, Jessie.

462
00:36:13,437 --> 00:36:17,840
- It's you.
- Yes, it is more or less.

463
00:36:19,911 --> 00:36:21,936
Why didn't you tell me
you were having an operation?

464
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,413
I didn't want to cheer you up.

465
00:36:24,982 --> 00:36:26,142
Here.

466
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:33,414
- Free at last.
- I'm glad.

467
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:35,853
What?

468
00:36:36,427 --> 00:36:39,919
I'm glad, you know.
I'm glad you're back.

469
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:54,168
Well, well, well.
How are you, my old fruit?

470
00:36:55,012 --> 00:36:57,503
Do you think Jessie
will cut my toenails?

471
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:02,884
I wouldn't let her near my body
with anything sharp.

472
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,781
- No.
- What's that smell?

473
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:09,717
- Cologne.
- Oh, God.

474
00:37:09,827 --> 00:37:13,354
Get rid of it! It's making me vertiginous!

475
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:15,398
Drinks, gentlemen?

476
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:18,861
This is unusual, Jessie.

477
00:37:20,671 --> 00:37:26,166
Are you on ketamine,
GBH or just the mushrooms?

478
00:37:26,544 --> 00:37:30,378
- Very good, Uncle.
- You see, Maurice, I'm contemporary.

479
00:37:30,481 --> 00:37:31,709
Right.

480
00:37:31,816 --> 00:37:33,875
- I can't see.
- What?

481
00:37:33,985 --> 00:37:36,715
- I can't see. Put it somewhere else.
- Where?

482
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:40,655
Somewhere else. There.
Where you like. There, over there.

483
00:37:41,692 --> 00:37:46,152
- God, I can't breathe!
- Stop shouting then.

484
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,324
I can't get through to you otherwise!

485
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,766
- Oh, no. No.
- What now?

486
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:53,496
Oh, God!

487
00:37:53,571 --> 00:37:54,765
Thank you.

488
00:37:54,872 --> 00:37:58,239
Everyone knows
you don't put milk in lemon tea.

489
00:37:58,342 --> 00:37:59,934
You like milk.

490
00:38:00,044 --> 00:38:04,947
I've told you, only on my cereal.
Not on anything else.

491
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:06,676
You like it in your hot chocolate.

492
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:10,744
- What?
- I said you like it in your hot chocolate.

493
00:38:10,855 --> 00:38:17,260
God! I'm exhausted, I really am.
Fan me, Maurice, before I expire.

494
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:19,090
Nuts, anyone?

495
00:38:21,065 --> 00:38:23,693
Bloody nuts! God.

496
00:38:25,202 --> 00:38:28,797
I can't wait to get back to work.
I'll take anything.

497
00:38:28,906 --> 00:38:33,400
- Really?
- Except corpses. No, I don't need that.

498
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,377
I've cornered the market there.

499
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:38,279
If I don't get anything,
I'll write my memoirs.

500
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:41,783
- That shouldn't take long.
- What?

501
00:38:45,289 --> 00:38:49,055
What do you do to her at your age?

502
00:38:49,927 --> 00:38:54,489
It's a very difficult thing.
But I'm nice to her.

503
00:38:54,598 --> 00:38:55,997
Yeah?

504
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:01,096
- I'll make you a cup of tea.
- Thank you.

505
00:39:03,741 --> 00:39:05,572
<i>You're like a little fairy.</i>

506
00:39:27,965 --> 00:39:30,195
I will die soon, Venus.

507
00:39:32,303 --> 00:39:34,328
Can I touch your hand?

508
00:39:34,438 --> 00:39:36,338
That's one chat up line I haven't heard.

509
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:39,876
- I'm impotent, of course.
- Thank Christ.

510
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:43,875
But I can still take a theoretical interest.

511
00:39:50,154 --> 00:39:54,488
- Have you been thinking about me?
- All the time I was in hospital.

512
00:39:57,361 --> 00:39:59,693
What did you think about me?

513
00:40:00,364 --> 00:40:02,127
I saw your body.

514
00:40:04,835 --> 00:40:06,325
Which part?

515
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:09,839
Your hair.

516
00:40:11,208 --> 00:40:12,675
Your feet.

517
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:17,576
Your legs, your behind, your eyes.

518
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:22,082
- My eyes?
- Your elbows.

519
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,314
Your cunt.

520
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,652
Oh, shut up.

521
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,230
You can touch my hand.

522
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:17,198
Only with your fingers.

523
00:41:18,242 --> 00:41:20,938
Anything else will make me vomitous.

524
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,411
Can I ask you,

525
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:31,880
have you ever been in love before?

526
00:41:44,401 --> 00:41:48,838
I can do it. I want to do it.
I am well enough. I need the money.

527
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:54,640
Thank you. But I will need a big car.

528
00:41:56,947 --> 00:41:59,609
Yeah, an enormous fucker.

529
00:42:01,752 --> 00:42:05,654
- You must be really famous.
- I am. I am.

530
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:10,318
It's a really important role.

531
00:42:10,427 --> 00:42:12,918
The linchpin of the story.

532
00:42:12,997 --> 00:42:16,433
Yep, it's also a speaking part.

533
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:21,935
I'll explain everything to you
on the way.

534
00:42:22,006 --> 00:42:24,668
I think you should work in films.

535
00:42:24,775 --> 00:42:26,868
- Do you?
- Definitely, yes.

536
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:30,639
Hey, can we open the roof?

537
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:52,128
This is wicked!

538
00:42:54,071 --> 00:42:56,232
Turn it up, my man!

539
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,205
More volume.

540
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:44,684
You will see how fickle men are in love,
just like women.

541
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:48,088
I will not believe it
until I see it with my own eyes.

542
00:43:48,192 --> 00:43:49,591
They come.

543
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:55,129
- You were in love with another?
- I don't love you!

544
00:43:55,232 --> 00:43:58,895
But my body cannot do
without your hands!

545
00:44:01,038 --> 00:44:07,375
You see that when it comes to love,
men...

546
00:44:11,415 --> 00:44:12,439
And cut.

547
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:14,778
- End board.
- Cut. Cut.

548
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:17,445
Are you okay, Maurice?
Someone bring him a chair.

549
00:44:17,554 --> 00:44:20,955
It's hot. These clothes are heavy.

550
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:31,597
- Barry. Barry?
- Thank you so much.

551
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:41,334
All right, well, let's...

552
00:44:41,445 --> 00:44:43,413
We're gonna have to move on,
then we can...

553
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:45,072
All right, that's fine, cool.

554
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:46,912
Let's give him
two minutes, right.

555
00:44:46,984 --> 00:44:48,349
Thank you.

556
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:51,249
Okay.

557
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:57,789
Ready.

558
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:03,995
"I am sorry, my love,
but we must part for good.

559
00:45:06,537 --> 00:45:10,633
"I am not the man to make you happy
and so we must say goodbye."

560
00:45:21,552 --> 00:45:23,986
Oh, sure. Sure.

561
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,186
How does she do it?
I could never have done that.

562
00:45:30,294 --> 00:45:33,957
- I'm sure you could.
- I didn't realize it was so hard.

563
00:45:34,665 --> 00:45:40,570
- It's brilliant. I could never do that.
- Mind you, she's terribly pretty.

564
00:45:42,639 --> 00:45:44,834
- Am I not?
- Oh, Venus!

565
00:45:44,908 --> 00:45:47,570
Now you've upset me.
Jesus, Maurice, do you never learn?

566
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,043
- Sorry.
- You will be.

567
00:45:49,146 --> 00:45:51,910
My dear,
will you pass me my trousers?

568
00:46:00,190 --> 00:46:02,317
- What is that?
- A catheter.

569
00:46:02,392 --> 00:46:04,553
- Oh, my God!
- I think it's leaking.

570
00:46:04,661 --> 00:46:06,151
I don't want it on my shoes.

571
00:46:06,230 --> 00:46:08,164
- You're always dripping, Maurice.
- Hold on.

572
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:09,699
There's always bits of you
where there shouldn't be.

573
00:46:11,101 --> 00:46:12,864
Pass me that towel.

574
00:46:19,676 --> 00:46:21,041
Come in.

575
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:24,413
- You asked for cash?
- Thank you.

576
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:30,219
I wonder if the shops are open.

577
00:46:32,523 --> 00:46:35,617
- Do you think they'll suit me?
- I don't know.

578
00:46:35,726 --> 00:46:37,853
Let me look at your ears.

579
00:46:38,629 --> 00:46:40,187
Perfect.

580
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:42,789
- Don't touch.
- I know, I know.

581
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:46,967
Come on.

582
00:46:47,938 --> 00:46:49,929
Have you got the bloody money
this time?

583
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:54,204
Oh, yes. Tons of it. I've got a pocketful.

584
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:15,159
I think I'm gonna wear these tonight.

585
00:47:18,569 --> 00:47:19,900
Venus,

586
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:25,507
you look like a movie star.

587
00:47:47,764 --> 00:47:49,925
Is there an old man odor?

588
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:54,162
Not so much this evening.

589
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,596
I wonder why.

590
00:48:00,978 --> 00:48:03,139
You can kiss my shoulders.

591
00:48:03,780 --> 00:48:05,042
Can I?

592
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,975
Three kisses.

593
00:48:21,632 --> 00:48:23,224
Three, I said!

594
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:26,461
And no licking and burping,
you dirty, filthy, little shithead.

595
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:34,504
- Oh, you please me.
- And you me.

596
00:48:47,658 --> 00:48:49,922
Steady, steady.

597
00:48:53,063 --> 00:48:55,896
I'm just out of intensive care.

598
00:49:00,737 --> 00:49:02,705
You ask for it, Maurice.

599
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:05,571
You know you do,
with your forwardness.

600
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:15,349
Don't you believe in anything,
Maurice?

601
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:21,286
Pleasure, I like.

602
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,258
I've tried to give pleasure.

603
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:29,425
That's all I'd recommend to anyone.

604
00:49:31,935 --> 00:49:34,961
You've made me sticky
with your slug tongue.

605
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,467
I think I'll have a bath.

606
00:49:40,277 --> 00:49:41,801
Well, well.

607
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,281
I'll run it for you.

608
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:55,153
This other man,

609
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:59,160
the other man who loved you,

610
00:50:00,230 --> 00:50:02,824
was he not kind to you?

611
00:50:02,933 --> 00:50:06,391
He was kind, for a time.

612
00:50:08,505 --> 00:50:11,065
He promised me things.

613
00:50:11,141 --> 00:50:13,075
He bought me stuff.

614
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:19,575
We had champagne
and there were roses.

615
00:50:21,184 --> 00:50:23,152
Then you got pregnant.

616
00:50:25,622 --> 00:50:29,183
- Does everyone know?
- It's happened to girls before.

617
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:37,795
Then...

618
00:50:40,637 --> 00:50:42,935
Then he stopped being kind.

619
00:50:45,042 --> 00:50:47,010
He went the other way.

620
00:50:48,979 --> 00:50:50,879
A long way that way.

621
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,314
He were engaged.

622
00:50:58,522 --> 00:51:00,046
I didn't know.

623
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:06,520
It wasn't a miscarriage.

624
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:10,890
My mum called it that.

625
00:51:15,806 --> 00:51:17,706
It were an abortion.

626
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:22,339
And she made me.

627
00:51:24,247 --> 00:51:25,578
Terrible.

628
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:27,844
Yeah.

629
00:51:29,019 --> 00:51:30,213
Yeah.

630
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:45,328
"Shall I compare thee
to a summer's day?

631
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:49,429
"Thou art more lovely
and more temperate:

632
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:52,440
"Rough winds do shake
the darling buds of May,

633
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:57,445
"And summer's lease
hath all too short a date:

634
00:51:57,547 --> 00:52:01,881
"Sometime too hot the eye
of heaven shines,

635
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:05,921
"And often
is his gold completion dimm'd,

636
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:10,425
"And every fair from fair
sometime declines,

637
00:52:10,527 --> 00:52:15,988
"By chance, or nature's
changing course untrimm'd,

638
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:20,400
"But thy eternal summer shall not fade,

639
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:24,372
"Nor lose possession
of that fair thou ow'st,

640
00:52:24,441 --> 00:52:28,400
"Nor shall death brag
thou wander'st in his shade,

641
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:34,451
"When in eternal lines to time
thou grow'st,

642
00:52:34,551 --> 00:52:39,579
"So long as men can breathe,
and eyes can see,

643
00:52:39,689 --> 00:52:44,888
"So long lives this,
and this gives life to thee."

644
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:56,637
Venus?

645
00:53:06,750 --> 00:53:08,547
Thank you.

646
00:53:08,618 --> 00:53:10,483
You look wonderful.

647
00:53:11,988 --> 00:53:13,387
Luminous.

648
00:53:14,157 --> 00:53:15,419
Bright.

649
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:20,287
- Startling.
- Do I?

650
00:53:27,003 --> 00:53:29,301
- That story I told you.
- Yes.

651
00:53:31,575 --> 00:53:34,339
- You don't think I'm low, do you?
- No.

652
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:39,279
- <i>Let's have dinner.</i>
- <i>No, Maurice, I'm going out.</i>

653
00:53:42,185 --> 00:53:43,743
What a shame.

654
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:48,189
- Anywhere nice?
- A party.

655
00:53:49,192 --> 00:53:51,524
- Alone?
- With a boy.

656
00:53:53,463 --> 00:53:54,953
Jolly good.

657
00:53:56,499 --> 00:53:59,195
- Which boy?
- Keep your nose out.

658
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:00,667
Of course.

659
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:07,535
You can go to the party for an hour
and we can meet later.

660
00:54:07,644 --> 00:54:10,477
- It's an all-night party.
- Right.

661
00:54:12,148 --> 00:54:15,481
- How will you stay up all night?
- I'll manage.

662
00:54:17,020 --> 00:54:20,285
- Uncle Ian will worry.
- It's all right. I've already asked him.

663
00:54:20,357 --> 00:54:24,316
I think he'll be pleased to get rid of me.
I don't think he likes me very much.

664
00:54:24,394 --> 00:54:27,056
- He thinks I'm horrible.
- He does.

665
00:54:27,163 --> 00:54:29,688
But I like you, Venus. I like you.

666
00:54:31,635 --> 00:54:33,068
I love you.

667
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:37,666
Bye.

668
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:40,803
Can we meet tomorrow?

669
00:54:40,877 --> 00:54:44,369
Yeah, okay.
I'll meet you after lunch, by the canal.

670
00:54:46,182 --> 00:54:48,241
Thanks for the earrings.

671
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,874
- Hello.
- Hello.

672
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:48,206
Have I forgotten? Did I invite you?

673
00:55:48,278 --> 00:55:52,214
No, I invited you
and I wanted to see you.

674
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:55,216
Did you?

675
00:55:56,953 --> 00:55:58,318
Good God.

676
00:56:03,593 --> 00:56:04,821
Maurice.

677
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:08,457
Maurice, quickly!

678
00:56:08,565 --> 00:56:11,432
Why do you keep shouting
when I am cooking?

679
00:56:11,501 --> 00:56:14,561
You're on TV. Look, look.

680
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:19,074
Oh, Christ!

681
00:56:20,977 --> 00:56:23,810
Oh, how handsome you were.

682
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:28,583
- And there's that woman...
- Yeah, yeah.

683
00:56:28,651 --> 00:56:30,846
...who took you away from us.

684
00:56:33,323 --> 00:56:34,756
It's burning.

685
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:37,657
- You will burn, Maurice.
- Yes, dear.

686
00:56:38,862 --> 00:56:40,762
<i>...get my grouch thoughts in order.</i>

687
00:56:41,698 --> 00:56:43,325
It's very good.

688
00:56:52,108 --> 00:56:54,167
You were a good mother.

689
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,974
I rather left you holding the baby,
didn't I?

690
00:57:00,049 --> 00:57:04,611
You did do that.
Three children under six, to be exact.

691
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:09,386
I can see
it must have been inconvenient.

692
00:57:09,492 --> 00:57:12,222
That you put your own pleasure first?

693
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:18,827
I did love you.

694
00:57:22,372 --> 00:57:24,863
For a time.

695
00:57:24,974 --> 00:57:28,239
And for the rest of the time,
I was fond of you.

696
00:57:28,344 --> 00:57:32,007
- Please, no. No, don't.
- More than fond of you.

697
00:57:32,081 --> 00:57:35,209
You don't have to. I don't want it.

698
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:40,654
It's my goodbye to you.

699
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:42,884
Why, where are you going?

700
00:57:54,871 --> 00:57:57,772
- We won't live forever.
- No.

701
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:04,898
You looked rather forlorn.

702
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:08,232
This is a rare treat, my friend.

703
01:00:09,238 --> 01:00:11,729
There are no pockets in a shroud.

704
01:00:14,077 --> 01:00:17,911
Oh, God, it's a long way up, eh?

705
01:00:22,585 --> 01:00:26,578
- '57, I first saw you.
- It was?

706
01:00:26,689 --> 01:00:29,249
You were a strapping Laertes.

707
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:33,352
Strapping? Yeah, sounds like me.

708
01:00:33,429 --> 01:00:36,398
The Ophelia
was something of a minger.

709
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:39,263
You wore a kilt, if I'm not mistaken.

710
01:00:40,103 --> 01:00:42,571
Bloody Peter Hall.

711
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:49,740
I love this horrible place.

712
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:57,076
It reminds me
of what I wanted to become.

713
01:01:01,924 --> 01:01:03,755
Another large one?

714
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:07,054
Hmm.

715
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,424
Yes.

716
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:15,368
- Come on.
- What?

717
01:01:15,438 --> 01:01:17,736
- I've got a good idea.
- What?

718
01:01:19,909 --> 01:01:23,609
- What?
- You'll see.

719
01:01:26,783 --> 01:01:28,045
Shit.

720
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:31,652
Oh, God.

721
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:36,958
You must protect the old man.

722
01:01:54,077 --> 01:01:56,341
- Boris Karloff.
- Yeah, I know.

723
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:58,676
He was a sweetie, apparently.

724
01:01:59,782 --> 01:02:01,340
Mr. Pratt.

725
01:02:03,252 --> 01:02:06,517
Robert Shaw. Richard Beckinsale.

726
01:02:09,959 --> 01:02:12,484
They're running out of room here.

727
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:17,595
Luckily Ian isn't a long name.

728
01:02:37,186 --> 01:02:40,678
- Shall we?
- Oh, yes.

729
01:04:11,914 --> 01:04:14,576
I'm sorry I didn't come to meet you.

730
01:04:17,453 --> 01:04:19,819
You can smell my neck.

731
01:04:19,922 --> 01:04:22,220
- I can?
- You can.

732
01:04:23,659 --> 01:04:26,992
No kissing.
That would make me never come back.

733
01:04:28,798 --> 01:04:30,390
I understand.

734
01:04:56,993 --> 01:05:02,124
- You like to do this, don't you?
- There really isn't anything else.

735
01:05:03,032 --> 01:05:04,659
- Maurice?
- Yes.

736
01:05:06,535 --> 01:05:09,800
- I want something.
- You do?

737
01:05:11,540 --> 01:05:15,340
I'm sure it's something
I'll have to think about.

738
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:18,971
- For how long?
- I don't know.

739
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:31,284
- Why don't we move things on a little?
- How could we do that?

740
01:05:34,363 --> 01:05:36,991
- I want to give you a treat.
- You do?

741
01:05:37,066 --> 01:05:40,467
- I want to cheer you up.
- Yes? How?

742
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:45,997
- How?
- Watch.

743
01:06:32,188 --> 01:06:33,883
Thanks, Maurice.

744
01:07:18,634 --> 01:07:20,499
Sit, please. Sit.

745
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:23,632
Thank you.

746
01:07:41,824 --> 01:07:43,815
You insult me.

747
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:48,090
On the contrary,
the insult is on the other side.

748
01:07:48,164 --> 01:07:51,463
- How so?
- Do I look like a fool? Do I?

749
01:07:53,169 --> 01:07:54,295
Answer me.

750
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:57,203
Don't tempt me,
I haven't had my tranquillizer yet.

751
01:07:57,306 --> 01:08:00,537
Yes, you're easily tempted,
as we know.

752
01:08:00,643 --> 01:08:06,343
I've been questioning
my niece's daughter very closely,

753
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:08,144
in search of the facts.

754
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:13,154
- You begged me to find her work.
- You have degraded that girl.

755
01:08:13,222 --> 01:08:18,319
Jessie is a shy, provincial girl.

756
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:21,955
To take advantage
of such a vulnerable, young person,

757
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:26,832
to take her to drinking establishments,
ply her with alcohol.

758
01:08:26,902 --> 01:08:30,804
- She plied me.
- Oh, really?

759
01:08:31,540 --> 01:08:36,034
Yes, well, did you buy these?

760
01:08:37,079 --> 01:08:38,341
These?

761
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:41,341
Hmm?

762
01:08:42,051 --> 01:08:43,348
This is ridiculous.

763
01:08:43,419 --> 01:08:47,719
She said you paid for her
to be tattooed!

764
01:08:47,823 --> 01:08:49,688
- Did you?
- Oh, Christ.

765
01:08:49,758 --> 01:08:51,589
It was a small snake.

766
01:08:51,694 --> 01:08:53,025
Well, well, well.

767
01:08:53,095 --> 01:08:55,586
You never welcomed her.
You called her vile.

768
01:08:55,698 --> 01:08:57,097
That is a lie!

769
01:08:57,199 --> 01:09:00,532
Now, hang on, Ian, old man.
You have to admit,

770
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:03,538
you did have one or two little
reservations about her character.

771
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:07,007
How dare you?
What the hell do you mean?

772
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:10,170
You handed her that halibut
and expected her to...

773
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:12,612
To what? To cook it?

774
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:16,947
That's all.
That's perverted exploitation?

775
01:09:17,052 --> 01:09:21,887
But to be so desperate,
to behave without respect for me...

776
01:09:21,957 --> 01:09:23,083
Now you strike me!

777
01:09:23,192 --> 01:09:25,285
Maurice, please.
We come here every day.

778
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:26,861
They bring us croissants
with our coffee.

779
01:09:26,929 --> 01:09:29,124
Did you see? I have been struck!

780
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:33,099
Get some sense into your thick skull
before you die, Ian!

781
01:09:33,202 --> 01:09:36,365
You venomous rat! A dying man.

782
01:09:36,438 --> 01:09:39,032
- A bloody fool, too!
- Right, let's have you!

783
01:09:39,108 --> 01:09:40,735
- Oh, come on.
- I'll take you on.

784
01:09:40,809 --> 01:09:43,471
Come on,
where are we going with this?

785
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:45,740
- He hit me again! Did you see that?
- Come on!

786
01:09:45,814 --> 01:09:48,112
- What is this, catheters at dawn?
- Oh, shut up.

787
01:09:48,217 --> 01:09:50,242
I'm going to have to bar
you two troublemakers.

788
01:09:50,319 --> 01:09:51,980
- He started it!
- I did not!

789
01:09:52,087 --> 01:09:55,284
- Yes!
- Out! I want you out! Out of here! Out!

790
01:09:55,391 --> 01:09:59,293
All right, I'm going.
Don't worry, I'm going.

791
01:09:59,395 --> 01:10:01,556
- Get out of here! Get out!
- Out!

792
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:27,316
Hiya.

793
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:37,092
Can we come in?

794
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:13,292
Go on, ask him.

795
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:25,376
Maurice?

796
01:11:27,516 --> 01:11:30,212
Do you want to go for a little walk?

797
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:36,489
Exercise is good for some people,
I've heard.

798
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:54,863
<i>...barbarous, most degenerate...</i>

799
01:12:56,305 --> 01:13:00,366
"To be or not to be,
that is the question."

800
01:13:17,893 --> 01:13:21,385
No! No! Out!

801
01:13:22,798 --> 01:13:24,493
Out! Out!

802
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:28,826
- Out! Out!
- All right, mate!

803
01:13:29,571 --> 01:13:31,505
I ain't finished yet.

804
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:35,235
All right, keep your hair on!
Keep your hair on, mate.

805
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:47,553
You invited us in, old man.

806
01:13:47,656 --> 01:13:49,521
Come on, let's go.

807
01:13:52,661 --> 01:13:57,098
And you are a dirty, dirty, old man.

808
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:01,230
And you are on your way.

809
01:14:03,505 --> 01:14:05,268
- Oh, no, not the stick!
- Stop it!

810
01:14:05,374 --> 01:14:07,433
I'm really frightened, Granddad.

811
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:15,078
Come on! Just leave the fucking door!

812
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:17,175
Come on. Stop fucking pissing...

813
01:14:17,252 --> 01:14:20,050
- My fucking head is fucking hurting!
- Come on, then!

814
01:14:20,122 --> 01:14:22,113
What's your fucking problem?

815
01:14:22,224 --> 01:14:25,022
You stupid bastard,
what have you done?

816
01:15:00,429 --> 01:15:01,760
<i>Maurice!</i>

817
01:15:02,764 --> 01:15:04,163
Maurice!

818
01:15:07,503 --> 01:15:10,301
Maurice! Open the door, Maurice!

819
01:15:24,953 --> 01:15:27,251
Are you responsible for this?

820
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:29,115
Hmm?

821
01:15:33,495 --> 01:15:37,158
Apparently there was an intruder,
though there's no sign of forced entry.

822
01:15:37,266 --> 01:15:39,166
- He was knocked down.
- Who was it?

823
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:40,530
Well,
I did ask for a description

824
01:15:40,636 --> 01:15:43,799
and all he could say was,
"He was damned ugly".

825
01:15:43,872 --> 01:15:46,534
He's a white male, in his early 70s.

826
01:15:46,942 --> 01:15:50,139
- Romeo, Uniform, Sierra, Sierra...
- Well, you have to take him in.

827
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:53,204
If the worst comes to the worst,
tomorrow morning will be all right.

828
01:15:53,315 --> 01:15:56,614
He can't stay here alone.
I'll phone you back.

829
01:15:58,053 --> 01:15:59,714
Hi.

830
01:15:59,821 --> 01:16:03,814
I'm having some trouble getting a bed.
He needs someone with him.

831
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:06,452
- Are you...
- No, of course not.

832
01:16:06,528 --> 01:16:09,656
I could die at any moment myself.
I've got high blood pressure.

833
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:14,828
I've got chronic anxiety,
burning indigestion.

834
01:16:14,903 --> 01:16:16,996
Yeah, okay. Right.

835
01:16:17,072 --> 01:16:18,699
Venus.

836
01:16:23,345 --> 01:16:25,472
Venus.

837
01:16:25,547 --> 01:16:28,311
Who the hell is Venus?

838
01:16:29,751 --> 01:16:31,013
I am.

839
01:16:31,987 --> 01:16:35,821
He wants to see you.
He's asked if you'll look after him.

840
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:37,385
Her?

841
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:40,522
Yes.

842
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:09,880
I'm sorry.

843
01:17:11,760 --> 01:17:13,591
Please, forgive me.

844
01:17:18,066 --> 01:17:19,931
Let it go, Maurice.

845
01:17:21,236 --> 01:17:23,067
I'll do anything.

846
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:26,802
Please.

847
01:17:28,143 --> 01:17:30,304
I'll never be mean again.

848
01:17:32,414 --> 01:17:33,642
Sorry.

849
01:17:36,151 --> 01:17:37,641
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

850
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:51,497
Maurice?

851
01:17:52,768 --> 01:17:54,133
Maurice?

852
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:57,100
Can you hear me?

853
01:17:58,306 --> 01:17:59,830
Make a sign.

854
01:18:02,077 --> 01:18:03,442
Maurice?

855
01:18:14,589 --> 01:18:16,284
Look, Maurice.

856
01:18:32,541 --> 01:18:36,807
<i>"Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,</i>

857
01:18:36,878 --> 01:18:41,611
"The dear repose
for limbs with travel tired,

858
01:18:41,683 --> 01:18:44,777
"But then begins a journey
in my head."

859
01:18:48,190 --> 01:18:49,987
What do you want?

860
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:15,510
Well, they're coming
to take you to hospital now.

861
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,381
But I've got you.

862
01:19:18,754 --> 01:19:23,714
- Maurice.
- I have got a much better idea.

863
01:19:24,993 --> 01:19:26,483
Have you?

864
01:21:10,498 --> 01:21:13,433
I knew you would enjoy yourself.

865
01:21:20,141 --> 01:21:22,541
I think we should go home now.

866
01:21:23,778 --> 01:21:26,042
A little longer.

867
01:21:30,518 --> 01:21:33,043
- Are you tired?
- Oh, yes.

868
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:38,724
- What shall we do?
- Carry on.

869
01:21:40,462 --> 01:21:41,690
Yeah.

870
01:21:44,866 --> 01:21:47,562
Will you take off my boots?

871
01:21:50,338 --> 01:21:54,399
- It's too cold, Maurice.
- I know. I know.

872
01:21:54,843 --> 01:21:57,812
It was always bloody cold.

873
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:00,846
Will you?

874
01:22:03,718 --> 01:22:04,912
Yeah.

875
01:22:58,106 --> 01:22:59,368
Now

876
01:23:01,576 --> 01:23:03,544
we can really talk.

877
01:23:05,246 --> 01:23:06,474
Yeah.

878
01:23:16,124 --> 01:23:17,557
Maurice?

879
01:23:19,794 --> 01:23:21,159
Maurice?

880
01:23:22,597 --> 01:23:23,962
Maurice?

881
01:23:26,067 --> 01:23:27,659
Maurice?

882
01:23:27,769 --> 01:23:29,100
No, Maurice.

883
01:23:29,170 --> 01:23:30,660
Maurice?

884
01:23:30,772 --> 01:23:33,263
Maurice, wake up!

885
01:23:33,341 --> 01:23:35,138
Wake up, Maurice.

886
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:43,644
Excuse me, excuse me.

887
01:23:44,853 --> 01:23:48,016
I need to use your phone.
I think he's dead. I think he's dead.

888
01:23:48,123 --> 01:23:50,421
I need to use your phone, please.
I need to use your phone.

889
01:23:50,492 --> 01:23:52,824
Please? Please,
I need you to call an ambulance.

890
01:23:52,927 --> 01:23:54,087
I don't know what to do.

891
01:23:54,162 --> 01:23:58,155
I think he's dead. I think he's dead.
I don't know what to do.

892
01:24:46,815 --> 01:24:49,909
- So it was you.
- What?

893
01:24:53,721 --> 01:24:55,712
I'm his wife.

894
01:24:55,824 --> 01:24:58,725
He was thinking about someone
and it was you.

895
01:25:00,195 --> 01:25:03,358
Don't feel awkward. Ian told me.

896
01:25:04,532 --> 01:25:06,397
Ian still won't talk to me.

897
01:25:06,501 --> 01:25:09,868
He thinks I did for Maurice,
the paddling and stuff.

898
01:25:09,938 --> 01:25:13,567
The paddling was marvelous,
the best way to go.

899
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:18,008
He really were a celebrity.

900
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:21,276
When you die,
everyone wants to be your friend.

901
01:25:24,452 --> 01:25:26,784
What are you going to do?

902
01:25:26,888 --> 01:25:30,187
I'm not going home.
I can't go back now.

903
01:25:31,759 --> 01:25:34,421
And Ian won't have me in the house.

904
01:25:36,531 --> 01:25:39,591
I've got somewhere
you could stay for a bit.

905
01:26:10,932 --> 01:26:12,399
<i>Here we go.</i>

906
01:26:13,268 --> 01:26:15,168
Where's your friend?

907
01:26:22,243 --> 01:26:24,143
God, he was gorgeous.

908
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:28,244
Yes, he was gorgeous.

909
01:26:49,704 --> 01:26:51,865
She wants to return these.

910
01:26:53,808 --> 01:26:55,366
Say thank you.

911
01:27:04,819 --> 01:27:07,481
She wants to know
if you're still angry with her.

912
01:27:07,555 --> 01:27:09,546
She says she's sorry.

913
01:27:12,493 --> 01:27:15,792
Tell her I'm not angry now.

914
01:27:17,665 --> 01:27:21,328
I just wasn't ready
for someone like her.

915
01:27:23,838 --> 01:27:25,897
He says he's not angry...

916
01:27:33,881 --> 01:27:36,247
She says she'll come round tomorrow,
if you want.

917
01:27:36,351 --> 01:27:38,512
She'll cook you some fish.

918
01:27:40,722 --> 01:27:42,155
Tell her

919
01:27:45,026 --> 01:27:47,085
we can cook the fish

920
01:27:49,230 --> 01:27:50,595
together.

921
01:27:51,566 --> 01:27:53,056
Are you sure
you don't want to come in?

922
01:27:53,167 --> 01:27:55,863
- No, no.
- All right, see you then.

923
01:28:43,618 --> 01:28:45,950
How many columns did he get?
