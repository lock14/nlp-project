1
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,666
I hate surprises.

2
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:25,834
-Yeah?
-Yes.

3
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,669
You didn't mind when I surprised you
with my promotion.

4
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:30,839
Well, that wasn't a surprise,
that was earned by my genius husband.

5
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:32,174
Good answer by my genius wife.

6
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:34,218
See, l thought you only liked me
for my body.

7
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,512
l do like you for your body.

8
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,305
What are we doing?

9
00:01:40,391 --> 00:01:41,600
Surprise.

10
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,980
l don't understand. What is it?

11
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,066
-lt's a house.
-Yes.

12
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:51,360
Yes, l can see that. Thank you.

13
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:56,365
-Also known as a home, sanctuary, dwelling.
-Yeah?

14
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,869
Or, if you like, you could just call it ours.

15
00:02:01,704 --> 00:02:02,704
Ours?

16
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:05,958
Where would we get the money?

17
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:08,877
l mean, how do we
get into something like this?

18
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:10,587
Oh, l don't know.

19
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,675
Maybe with a key.

20
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:20,848
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, are you kidding?

21
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,895
lt's a classic.

22
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,939
1 920s, wood-frame.

23
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,108
Three bedroom, one-and-a-half bath.

24
00:02:31,192 --> 00:02:34,027
And the old owners even left us
a brand-new swing set out back.

25
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,530
Oh, well, l think l'm a little big
for swing sets.

26
00:02:36,573 --> 00:02:39,533
We have to fill up those spare rooms
sometime soon, right?

27
00:02:39,576 --> 00:02:40,993
Thank you.

28
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:51,587
-l love you.
-l love you, too.

29
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:53,130
Let's go home.

30
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:20,365
Mommy?

31
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:22,534
When's Daddy coming home?

32
00:03:22,619 --> 00:03:25,787
-What, baby?
-When's Daddy coming home?

33
00:03:29,042 --> 00:03:31,960
Today, baby. lt was just an overnight trip.

34
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:34,463
Why couldn't he take us?

35
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:37,132
Because it was work and we couldn't go.

36
00:03:37,175 --> 00:03:39,134
But how about a, "Good morning, Mommy.

37
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:40,928
-"Nice to see you."
-Good morning, Mommy.

38
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,765
-Mom, you gotta get dressed.
-Sweetie, we got plenty of time.

39
00:03:45,975 --> 00:03:48,477
-We're gonna be late for school.
-Oh, no.

40
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:51,146
We're not gonna be late for school.

41
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,523
Better get going or we'll be late for school.

42
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:05,911
Bridgette, are you okay
with your spelling words?

43
00:04:05,995 --> 00:04:07,037
Yes, Mom.

44
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,997
Hey, hey, hey, don't forget your lunches.

45
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:12,417
You got it? Here. Got it?
Give me a kiss. Bye. Bye.

46
00:04:12,502 --> 00:04:14,503
-Come on, Megan.
-l am!

47
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:51,600
This isn't dirty.

48
00:06:23,508 --> 00:06:25,258
Hey, girl, what's going on?

49
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:27,427
I can't beIieve it's Thursday aIready.

Tell me about it.
l have no idea where this week went.

51
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:31,515
God, l wish you were here.

52
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:35,477
l am having the hardest time
trying to pick out my dress for tonight.

53
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:37,813
What about you guys?
You have any big plans for the weekend?

54
00:06:37,897 --> 00:06:40,148
What, besides jetting off to Acapulco? No.

55
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,318
Yeah, right. Okay, l gotta go.

56
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,904
l gotta figure out
what l'm doing with my life right now.

57
00:06:45,988 --> 00:06:47,948
Oh, yeah? what's his name?

58
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,826
His name?
Well, the name is really bad. lt's Harry.

59
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,161
But, you never know, he couId be the one.

60
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,329
Bye.

61
00:06:58,543 --> 00:07:01,002
You have one new message.

62
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:02,587
First new message.

63
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:06,508
Linda, Iisten, I need to teII you something.

64
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:12,180
I meant what I said in front
of the girls the other night, and...

65
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,308
I just...

66
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,521
I just want you to know that

67
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,024

00:07:47,717 --> 00:07:49,759
Okay? Bye.

75
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:18,788
Mrs. Hanson?

76
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:19,956
Yes?

77
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:21,541

78
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:26,505

79
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:30,425

80
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:34,429
-Your husband, Jim...
-Yeah?

81
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,931
...was in a car accident.

82
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,727
He died on the scene.

83
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,949
-When?
-Yesterday.

84
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,869
No. No, it's impossible because l just...

85
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:01,456
l just heard his voice
on the answering machine, so...

86
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,085
Well, l'm sorry, ma'am.

87
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:08,964
We couldn't get to you any sooner.

88
00:09:11,801 --> 00:09:15,053
The other driver was in a truck. A semi.

89
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,139
They're certain it was instantaneous.

90
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,933
lt jackknifed. 220.

91
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,311
He was on the highway,
around mile marker 220.

92
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:25,981
The truck driver was killed as well.

93
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,024
l'm very sorry about your husband.

94
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:31,403
Ma'am, is there anything that l can do?

95
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:35,532
Ma'am? Mrs. Hanson? Ma'am?

96
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:39,160
Ma'am, is there anything that l can do?

97
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:42,289
Can l call someone for you?

98
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,798
Let me leave you my card. Okay?

99
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:54,801
lf you have any questions, you just call me.

100
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:12,170
What's wrong, Mommy?

101
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,761
Mommy?

102
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,973
What's wrong?

103
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,321
lt's about Daddy.

104
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:40,156
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

105
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:46,079
He's had a very bad accident.

106
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,915
What kind of accident?

107
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:53,294
When is he coming home?

108
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:57,132
ls he okay?

109
00:11:59,844 --> 00:12:01,636
No, baby, he's not.

110
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,224
Come here.

111
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,161
Wow, l'm impressed.

112
00:12:26,996 --> 00:12:30,081
You guys got this far all by yourself?

113
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,332
Yeah.

114
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,918
That's really amazing.

115
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,674
Hey, it's Annie.

116
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:43,595
Leave a message at the beep,
and l promise l'll get right back to you.

117
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,514
Hey, Annie. lt's me.

118
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,103
Could you please call me
as soon as you get this message?

119
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,521
Thank you.

120
00:12:56,525 --> 00:13:00,570
Wow, you girls are doing so great.

121
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:04,240
Daddy's better at puzzles.

122
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:06,284
He was going to help us.

123
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:33,394
-Hi, honey.
-Hey.

124
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:37,106
l think l finally got them to sleep.

125
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,819
Oh, l should say good night.

126
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:43,488
No, don't do that.
They just fell asleep. Leave it.

127
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:44,781
Okay.

128
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:49,911
l was thinking about everything
we need to get done.

129
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:54,999
Tomorrow we should probably
start looking into funeral arrangements.

130
00:13:56,585 --> 00:14:01,339
And then, you know, just see
where you are in terms of insurance.

131
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:03,925
l'm not ready for that, Mom.

132
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,594
Nobody's ready for any of this, dear.

133
00:14:07,304 --> 00:14:10,765
But you'll be surprised
at how strong you're gonna be.

134
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,892
-You know when l lost your dad...
-l can't stop thinking

135
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,727
about our serving platter.

136
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:19,440
-What serving platter?
-You know, the big one on the top shelf,

137
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:21,818
the one that his folks gave us.

138
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:25,238
l can't reach that.

139
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,949
Jim... Jim does that for me.

140
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:35,790
Well, nobody expects you to get
everything done in the first few days, dear.

141
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,128
l... l'm pretty tired.

142
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:42,672
-l'm gonna go lie down in the den.
-Okay.

143
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:45,842
l'll get some sheets out of the closet.

144
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:49,512
l'll be right up here if you need me, dear.

145
00:17:06,817 --> 00:17:11,904
Mom?

146
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:30,233
Jim?

147
00:18:36,657 --> 00:18:38,116
What's wrong?

148
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,374
l don't... l don't know.

149
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,793
l just had... l just had the...

150
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:53,756
l just had the strangest...

151
00:18:54,508 --> 00:18:56,134
What? What is it?

152
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:01,681
Okay. l guess it's nothing.
lt's nothing, it's nothing.

153
00:19:05,894 --> 00:19:09,105
Mom, we're late.
Three times and we get detention.

154
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,731
And how is that
a good way to start the day?

155
00:19:10,816 --> 00:19:12,567
How about, "Good morning, Mommy."

156
00:19:12,651 --> 00:19:14,277
-Good morning.
-"Good to see you, Mommy."

157
00:19:14,361 --> 00:19:15,611
Good morning.

158
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,489
All right. l gotta get going.
Monday morning meeting.

159
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:23,327
l got hugs for everybody.
All right, l gotta get going.

160
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:26,497
l gotta train this new assistant manager.

161
00:19:28,834 --> 00:19:31,377
l packed their lunches. Ready to go.

162
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:34,589
Are you okay to take them to school?

163
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:40,511
Okay.

164
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,348
-You girls have fun at school now.
-Bye-bye, Daddy.

165
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:45,975
See you, honey.

166
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:07,288
-You okay with your spelling words, Bridge?
-Yes.

167
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,999
Hey, you guys, don't forget your lunch.

168
00:20:13,253 --> 00:20:16,130
-Come on, Megan, get out of the car.
-l'm coming.

169
00:20:43,116 --> 00:20:45,409
You have no messages.

170
00:20:58,715 --> 00:20:59,966
Oh!

171
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,471
Oh, shit.

172
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:17,942
-That was quite a stop there.
-Yeah, l just... l was totally...

173
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,862
Yeah, l just, l got comp...

174
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:27,159
l just, l was totally just distracted.

175
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:30,162
Let's just take it a little easy out there, huh?

176
00:21:30,205 --> 00:21:31,372
Sure.

177
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:33,582
We don't want anyone getting hurt now,
do we?

178
00:21:36,044 --> 00:21:37,962
l'm trying to figure out, should l call him?

179
00:21:38,046 --> 00:21:40,840
l mean, l really feel like l wanna call him,
but then it's kind of like

180
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:44,760
l think that's breaking the rules.
l think it's better if l just wait.

181
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:47,179
What?

182
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:52,184
-Did we talk yesterday?
-Yeah. We talk every day.

183
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:55,604
No, l mean, did l leave you a message?

184
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,567
l don't think so. Why?

185
00:22:00,610 --> 00:22:03,446
Wait a minute, hang on.
l'm the one with the crisis, okay? Are you...

186
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,407
-Are you sure you're all right?
-Yeah.

187
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,993
Everything's cool with you and Jim?

188
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:12,788
Yeah. Everything's exactly the same.

189
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,319
Oh, God.

190
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,369
So, how was everybody's day?

191
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:19,623
lt was okay.

192
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,792
-Kind of boring.
-Thank you.

193
00:24:21,877 --> 00:24:23,878
Yeah, kind of boring.

194
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,550
-Boring, huh?
-Yeah.

195
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:45,042
Jim?

196
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:12,319
Jim.

197
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,953
What the...

198
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:23,747
Lithium?

199
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:27,459
l...

200
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,687
Thanks for coming.

201
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:48,439
Here's your coffee.

202
00:26:49,691 --> 00:26:51,734
-You never know.
-Here she is.

203
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:53,235
Hi, honey.

204
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,406
-Did you get some rest?
-What's going on?

205
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,949
Hey, how you feeling?

206
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:00,951
Why don't you go upstairs
and let's get some clothes on.

207
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,411
You wanna go upstairs and get dressed?

208
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:05,205
-Where are the girls?
-The girls are fine, dear.

209
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,249
The girls are fine, honey.
Don't worry about the girls.

210
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,709
This isn't right.

211
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,294
-What isn't, sweetie?
-No, everything's fine.

212
00:27:10,378 --> 00:27:12,171
Do you need to go upstairs
and get more sleep? Or...

213
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:16,550
No, no, no, l don't need any more sleep,
and l don't need to wake up, either.

214
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,052
Everything's gonna be fine.

215
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:20,679
-No, Mother, everything is not fine!
-Okay.

216
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:24,058
-Something is really, really wrong.
-Okay.

217
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:25,601
l'm...

218
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,395
He's not dead.

219
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,825
Hi, baby.

220
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:43,327
Hey.

221
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:45,079
Hi.

222
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:48,415
Sorry l wasn't awake when you guys got up.

223
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,376
Grandma said we had to let you sleep.

224
00:27:50,418 --> 00:27:53,003
No, baby. You can always wake me up.

225
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:57,049
What's your sister doing?

226
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:59,385
-Swinging.
-Yeah?

227
00:27:59,427 --> 00:28:02,429
-l think she's sad.
-Yeah.

228
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,973
We're all a little sad right now.

229
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:14,525
Hi, baby.

230
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:26,161
Oh, my God.

231
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:28,580
Oh, my God, baby.

232
00:28:28,623 --> 00:28:31,041
Baby, what happened to your face?

233
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:33,460
Baby, talk to me.

234
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:35,462
How did you get these cuts?
Who did this to you, baby?

235
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,923
-Did what?
-The cuts! The cuts on your face.

236
00:28:37,966 --> 00:28:39,299
There's no cuts, Mommy.

237
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:41,343
What are you talking about?

238
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:45,055
She's perfect, like a beautiful princess.

239
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:54,648
Oh, God, come here. Come here.
Just hold onto me.

240
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:57,985
lt's gonna be okay.
lt's gonna be okay. Come here.

241
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:00,279
lt's gonna be all right.
Everything's gonna be all right.

242
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,322
Everything's gonna be all right.

243
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,074
-Mommy?
-Yeah?

244
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,994
What was it like when Daddy died?

245
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:11,081
l don't know, baby. l wasn't there.

246
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:14,209
So how did you know he died then?

247
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,704
Are you all right?

248
00:29:51,873 --> 00:29:53,874
What if this is a mistake?

249
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:56,084
What do you mean, "a mistake"?

250
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:58,962
People just don't die one day
and are okay the next day, that's all.

251
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,881
lt's not a mistake. Jim's...

252
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,884
-Okay, Mom, did you see inside the casket?
-No, l didn't see, dear, but it doesn't...

253
00:30:03,968 --> 00:30:06,553
Okay, well something is seriously
fucked up with this situation.

254
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,597
Linda? We need to go in the church now.
Come on, dear.

255
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,265
No, you need to take the kids inside.

256
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,684
-Well, why don't you come inside with us?
-Just take the kids inside.

257
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:14,812
Go ahead, go ahead with the kids. Linda.

258
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:16,063
Linda?

259
00:30:21,236 --> 00:30:22,736
Here she is.

260
00:30:24,989 --> 00:30:26,698
Hello, Mrs. Hanson.

261
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,992
l just want you to know
that everything's on schedule.

262
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,494
l need for you to open up the casket.

263
00:30:30,578 --> 00:30:33,121
No, no, l don't think
that would be a very good idea.

264
00:30:33,206 --> 00:30:35,082
Open up the casket, God damn it.

265
00:30:35,124 --> 00:30:36,708
Open it up! Open it up!

266
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,544
-Open it! Open it! Open it!
-Mrs. Hanson!

267
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,879
-What?
-l beg you to let this go.

268
00:30:40,922 --> 00:30:42,923
-Don't do this to me.
-Mrs. Hanson, l have to warn you.

269
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:45,175
-There was a problem with the body.
-What kind of problem?

270
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,928
They didn't want to tell you the way he died.
The didn't want to tell you.

271
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,639
-What about the way that he died?
-There was a deep cut, a severing.

272
00:30:50,723 --> 00:30:52,599
-What kind of severing?
-Well, it...

273
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,435
-Oh, my God.
-No! No!

274
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:01,525
Get out of the way! Stop it! Let go of me!

275
00:31:01,609 --> 00:31:04,111
Let go! Let go of me!

276
00:31:04,153 --> 00:31:09,074
No!

277
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,335
Jim left this world a beloved person.

278
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,798
His friends spoke about his kindness,

279
00:31:25,258 --> 00:31:26,633
his laugh,

280
00:31:27,468 --> 00:31:29,136
his graciousness,

281
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:34,391
his helpfulness and consideration
to everyone around him.

282
00:31:36,853 --> 00:31:40,314
But his greatest devotion was to his family.

283
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,693
His "girls" as he liked to refer to them.

284
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,321
His lovely wife, Linda.

285
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,657
His precious daughters,
Megan and Bridgette.

286
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,034
Mom?

287
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:53,243
What?

288
00:31:54,162 --> 00:31:56,747
-Who is that?
-And what better tribute is there to any man.

289
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:58,206
-Who?
-Her, that woman.

290
00:31:58,291 --> 00:32:01,460
Than the reflection of his own love
in the hearts

291
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:04,338
-of the loved ones he left behind.
-l don't know, dear.

292
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,425
-And so, dear friends...
-Linda?

293
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:11,094
-lt's okay. lt's okay.
-...let us pray.

294
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:19,978
Our Father, who art in heaven,
hallowed be Thy name.

295
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:26,276
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.

296
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:33,825
Wait. No, please, wait. Wait.

297
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:37,204
-l'm sorry.
-Stop.

298
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:40,332
-How do you know my husband?
-l just thought that after we talked and...

299
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:42,542
-We talked?
-Well, yeah, yesterday when...

300
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,044
Yesterday, l...

301
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,754
-You don't remember?
-No.

302
00:32:45,838 --> 00:32:47,798
l've never met you before in my life!

303
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,716
-l'm just gonna go, okay?
-Please, talk to me.

304
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,426
You have all my sympathies,
and your girls, too.

305
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:53,762
Who are you? Please. Don't just...

306
00:33:21,749 --> 00:33:24,793
"Lithium carbonate. Take two tablets.
No refills remaining.

307
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:27,087
"Dr. Norman Roth. Do not take with alcohol.

308
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,755
"Drowsiness and..."

309
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:32,843
"Dr. Norman Roth."

310
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:34,386
Dr. Norman Roth.

311
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:37,597
Mommy?

312
00:33:46,566 --> 00:33:49,609
Hey, why don't you guys go downstairs
and visit with Grandma and Aunt Annie?

313
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:50,819
No.

314
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:53,530
l'm sure it'd be fun.

315
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:56,283
What are you looking for, Mommy?

316
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,577
Mommy needs someone to talk to, baby.

317
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:00,495
Why don't you talk to us?

318
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:03,165
Baby, l love talking to you,
but this is grown-up talk,

319
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,667
and Mommy needs some help, okay?

00:34:05,752 --> 00:34:08,253

00:36:57,965 --> 00:37:00,258
-Honey, please don't be angry.
-No!

349
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,636
-Please. Please don't be angry with us.
-Mommy!

350
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:05,639
Wait a second. Annie.
Annie, what are you doing? Annie!

351
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:08,308
Linda, your family is worried about you.

352
00:37:08,351 --> 00:37:11,311
Your family cares about you,
about your situation, about the girls.

353
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,813
What are you doing?
Mom, what are you doing? Annie. Annie.

354
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,982
-Honey, what else could we do?
-What?

355
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:18,568
Just tell us what happened
to Bridgette's face.

356
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:20,654
Mom, l don't know what happened
to Bridgette's face.

357
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:22,113
Don't you see? That's what l mean.

358
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:25,367
Mom, l would never do anything
to harm my child!

359
00:37:25,451 --> 00:37:27,035
-For the girls' sake.
-Get away from me!

360
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,538
Baby, it's okay. God damn it!
l didn't do this. l didn't do this!

361
00:37:30,623 --> 00:37:32,415
-Linda, stop it!
-Get off of me!

362
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,709
No, you can't do this to me!
What are you doing?

363
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,337
-Baby, it's okay, baby!
-Mommy's all right!

364
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:39,381
No, no, baby! No, no!
lt's okay, baby! lt's okay!

365
00:37:39,465 --> 00:37:41,132
God, look at what you're doing!

366
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,384
Stop it!

367
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:46,596
No, it's okay, baby!
Mommy's sorry! Mommy's very sorry!

368
00:37:46,681 --> 00:37:48,682
Stop! Stop it!

369
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:52,352
Mom! Mom! Stop it!

370
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,021
l'm sorry.

371
00:38:10,037 --> 00:38:11,788
Sir! Sir! Sir!

372
00:38:19,422 --> 00:38:22,382
Obviously, she's never
been committed before.

373
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:26,219
The husband
was in a fatal car crash on Wednesday.

374
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:29,222
l told her about it on Thursday.

375
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,349
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on.

376
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,560
Wednesday?

377
00:38:34,562 --> 00:38:35,729
That's strange.

378
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:39,566
She showed up in my office on Tuesday

379
00:38:40,401 --> 00:38:44,487
claiming he was already dead
or was gonna be.

380
00:38:44,572 --> 00:38:46,614
She said he was gonna die
before the accident?

381
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:47,991
Yeah.

382
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:51,911
Are you sure it was an accident?

383
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,351
Hello, Linda.

384
00:39:16,103 --> 00:39:18,605
Please don't do this.
l just wanna go home to my girls.

385
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:20,148
Please don't do this.

386
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,942
Please, just let me go home to my girls.

387
00:39:23,027 --> 00:39:25,445
-Please don't do this.
-We'll have time to talk about that tomorrow.

388
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:28,031
Please, don't do this.
Please, please don't do this. Please.

389
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:31,117
Please don't. Don't do this.

390
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:45,882
Everything is gonna be just fine.

391
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:31,905
Jim?

392
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:36,951
What?

393
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:46,878
-You're okay?
-Come on, Linda,

394
00:41:46,921 --> 00:41:48,338
you're gonna get yourself soaked.

395
00:41:48,422 --> 00:41:50,924
Just give me a minute.
Just one more minute.

396
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:56,679
l can hear your heart beating
and it feels so good.

397
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:02,602
Hold on. Hey, hey, hey. Hold on.

398
00:42:02,686 --> 00:42:04,812
Everything's gonna be fine.

399
00:42:04,897 --> 00:42:06,481
Come on.

400
00:42:06,565 --> 00:42:10,068
-You promise?
-l promise. l promise.

401
00:42:12,863 --> 00:42:16,074
What is it, honey? Tell me what's going on.

402
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:18,660
l don't even know how to explain it.

403
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:48,231
-l gotta get going. l gotta get to work.
-Just give me a minute.

404
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:49,857
Just one more minute.

405
00:42:49,942 --> 00:42:53,570
l gotta... No, l gotta go.
l'm running late for work. l gotta go.

406
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:17,510
Girls?

407
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,307
-Morning, Mommy.
-Good morning.

408
00:43:22,349 --> 00:43:24,350
-Good morning, Mommy.
-Hi.

409
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,773
Hey.

410
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,193
Hi.

411
00:43:35,237 --> 00:43:36,321
Oh.

412
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:40,116
Oh, you're so beautiful. Do you know that?

413
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:43,494
You are. You're so beautiful.
You're both beautiful.

414
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:45,496
Oh.

415
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,508
All right, babies, listen to me.

416
00:43:57,551 --> 00:44:00,219
l need for you
to be very, very careful today, okay?

417
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:02,722
No playing at recess.
l don't want you running around, okay?

418
00:44:02,806 --> 00:44:04,766
-Ma'am, you're holding up the line.
-Sit quietly, promise me.

419
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,893
-Ma'am.
-Okay? Just give me a second!

420
00:44:06,977 --> 00:44:09,020
-Just promise me. Promise?
-l promise.

421
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,356
Okay, baby.
You gotta promise me, too, okay, honey?

422
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:13,691
-All right.
-Good girl. Okay. Here you go.

423
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:15,193
You guys be good.

424
00:44:17,571 --> 00:44:19,155
Ma'am, come on. Please.

425
00:46:02,468 --> 00:46:05,261
You've got Mrs. Lynne at 3:00
and then you're free until 5:00.

426
00:46:05,345 --> 00:46:06,512
Yeah, that's right. l...

427
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:07,680
-Keep that open for me.
-Okay.

428
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,307
-Who's this?
-Mrs. Stevenson.

429
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,808
Mrs. Steven...

430
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,354
-Can l help you?
-l'm Linda Hanson.

431
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:19,192
Hello, Linda. l'm Dr. Roth.

432
00:46:22,321 --> 00:46:23,863
Do you know me?

433
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,532
Should l?

434
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:31,412
l wake up and he's dead.
l wake up and he's alive.

435
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:35,833
Different things around me all the time
that l can't explain.

436
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:37,794
Things that l've done.

437
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:43,216
People talking to me.
People who know me but l have never met.

438
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:45,426
-People like me.
-Yes.

439
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:48,471
-Seems a little complicated.
-Tell me about it.

440
00:46:51,391 --> 00:46:53,643
What about the lithium bottle?

441
00:46:54,394 --> 00:46:56,062
l don't know. lt's... lt's...

442
00:46:56,146 --> 00:46:58,815
l don't know. l misplaced it somewhere.
l don't know.

443
00:46:58,899 --> 00:47:01,609
Look, l can't explain it,
but l thought if somebody was trying to...

444
00:47:01,693 --> 00:47:03,903
Trying to drug you?

445
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,155
-Why and who?
-l don't know. You tell me.

446
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:09,158
-l didn't prescribe it.
-But your name was on the bottle.

447
00:47:09,243 --> 00:47:12,578
-Why do you think l came here?
-To get some help.

448
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:15,915
Obviously, you're dealing
with some inconsistencies.

449
00:47:16,708 --> 00:47:19,919
Well, yeah. l wake up every morning
to find my husband has died again.

450
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:23,005
l think that goes
just a little beyond inconsistent.

451
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,759
How do you feel

452
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:30,888
during the times he's dead?

453
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,058
What?

454
00:47:34,101 --> 00:47:37,854
l mean, what kind of emotions
run through you?

455
00:47:37,938 --> 00:47:42,483
-ls it sorrow? Resentment? Relief?
-What are you saying?

456
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:47,113
Well, it's a pretty common daydream
to imagine people being dead.

457
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:49,949
l'm not daydreaming, okay?
l wake up and he is dead.

458
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,659
Except for today.

459
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:56,163
Do you have any history
of mental illness in your family?

460
00:47:56,248 --> 00:47:57,331
No.

461
00:47:57,416 --> 00:48:01,586
What about yourself?
Any episodes of psychosis?

462
00:48:01,628 --> 00:48:03,170
Memory loss?

463
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,881
Judgment lapses?

464
00:48:04,965 --> 00:48:07,842
l don't want him dead. lt was a car accident.

465
00:48:07,926 --> 00:48:09,719
Well, there's no crime imagining something.

466
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:12,513
l'm not imagining it. He's dead.

467
00:48:21,648 --> 00:48:23,608
Well, it is a little odd

468
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:28,571
-that the prescription was for lithium.
-Why?

469
00:48:28,655 --> 00:48:32,491
Because that's probably the best thing
for you right now.

470
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,162
lt'll help you cope.

471
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:41,834
Do you think you can make it in
to see me here tomorrow?

472
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:03,356
Hey, look who's here!

473
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,775
-Hey, Bob. ls Jim here?
-Yeah.

474
00:49:05,859 --> 00:49:08,736
How come you don't come by
and see us anymore?

475
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,282
-Honey?
-l need to talk to you.

476
00:49:13,367 --> 00:49:14,742
What is it?

477
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:16,869
What's going on?

478
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:19,205
l know l've been acting strange,
but there's something wrong.

479
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,706
There's something very wrong.

480
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:24,418
-What is it, the girls?
-No, no, no. They're fine, at least for now.

481
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:27,713
Can we just go somewhere? Just us?
Let's just take the girls. Let's go, just go.

482
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,757
Linda, l can't go anywhere. l have to work.

483
00:49:29,841 --> 00:49:34,011
-Please! l really need you. Can you just...
-Linda, l need to go to the sales meeting.

484
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:38,182
Excuse me. Jim, we're waiting for you.

485
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:43,729
l'm sorry.

486
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,398
Who are you?

487
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:48,317
l'm Claire Francis. You must be Jim's wife.

488
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,860
Yeah. Linda.

489
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:53,906
l've seen your pictures.
lt's nice to meet you.

490
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:58,494
Claire's our new assistant manager.

491
00:50:00,747 --> 00:50:04,125
Your husband's been really helpful
the last few weeks.

492
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:07,003
Guys! we're starting.

493
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:09,755
Excuse me.

494
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:18,764
We can talk about this later.

495
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:49,420
Who killed Cock Robin?

496
00:50:49,463 --> 00:50:54,592
"l," said the sparrow,
"with my little bow and arrow."

497
00:51:27,125 --> 00:51:29,460
Who saw him die?

498
00:51:49,064 --> 00:51:50,981
Oh, Christ! Girls!

499
00:51:51,024 --> 00:51:54,360
-Hurry! The laundry's outside. Grab it!
-Hurry!

500
00:51:57,823 --> 00:52:01,450
Start taking stuff down.
l'll meet you guys outside, okay?

501
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:07,498
Bridgette, no! Bridgette! Bridgette, no!

502
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:19,510
Baby! Okay, l'm right here. l'm right here.

503
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:24,014
Megan, go get me some towels. Please.

504
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:26,433
-Mommy!

505

Here, baby. lt's okay. lt's okay. lt's okay.

506
00:52:31,022 --> 00:52:32,606
lt's okay, baby.

507
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,152
She's still bleeding, Mommy.

508
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:40,156
-Somebody! Somebody, please!
-We need a gurney right away, please!

509
00:52:40,240 --> 00:52:41,657
l'm Dr. Norman.
Can you tell me what happened?

510
00:52:41,741 --> 00:52:43,242
She went through the glass door.

511
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,244
-Any allergies that we know about?
-She's allergic to codeine.

512
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:46,495
-Codeine.
-Codeine? Okay.

513
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,706
Put her in 14, please.
Ma'am, l'm gonna need you to wait out here.

514
00:52:48,748 --> 00:52:50,416
-Can l go with her?
-No, ma'am. We'll take care of her.

515
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:53,002
-Everything's gonna be fine.
-lt's gonna be okay, baby!

516
00:52:54,546 --> 00:52:57,673
-ls she okay?
-Yeah, they just took her in.

517
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,967
-They just took her in.
-You all right?

518
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,304
-What happened?
-She just... She was running.

519
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:07,558
l had to get the laundry and she was...
She just went through the glass window.

520
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:16,400
-Honey.
-lt's okay.

521
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:19,528
lt's okay.

522
00:53:21,781 --> 00:53:23,949
What are you doing, Mommy?

523
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:26,994
We are gonna
forget about mirrors for a while.

524
00:53:27,913 --> 00:53:29,622
Till you feel a little better.

525
00:53:29,664 --> 00:53:32,249
ls Bridgette gonna have ugly scars forever?

526
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:35,461
-l don't want any talk about scars.
-All right.

527
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:38,797
Because as far as l'm concerned,
there are no scars.

528
00:53:40,383 --> 00:53:42,843
And l don't care
what anyone tells you, okay?

529
00:53:42,928 --> 00:53:44,428
You understand?

530
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,806
Because you're beautiful.

531
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:49,767
Like a princess?

532
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:55,648
Yeah. Like a princess.

533
00:53:56,983 --> 00:53:58,651
My two princesses.

534
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:32,351
l thought you were gonna put up stickers.

535
00:54:32,394 --> 00:54:33,560
l did.

536
00:54:37,023 --> 00:54:38,899
l don't know. Maybe...

537
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:40,859
Maybe l thought l did.

538
00:54:43,154 --> 00:54:44,780
Christ, Linda.

539
00:54:44,864 --> 00:54:47,658
What?
What are you blaming me for this, now?

540
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:52,162
l've asked your mother
to come and stay while l'm gone.

541
00:54:52,872 --> 00:54:54,373
What? Why?

542
00:54:54,416 --> 00:54:56,250
-Just to help, you know.
-l don't need any help.

543
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:58,752
-Help take care of the kids.
-l don't need any help.

544
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:00,629
Look, you can take a break.

545
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,965
You know, get some time to yourself.

546
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:06,802
For what? Time to myself for what? What?
So l stop acting like a crazy person?

547
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:08,262
What are you talking about? l never...

548
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:11,724
You are not separating me from my kids.
l'm a good mom.

549
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,029
God!

550
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:33,180
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

551
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:38,143
Sunday. Monday. Tuesday. Wednesday.

552
00:56:38,228 --> 00:56:41,814
Thursday. Friday. Saturday.

553
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:45,818
Okay, Thursday, find out Jim died.

554
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:47,403
Find out Jim died.

555
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:55,911
Monday, Jim alive again.

556
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:57,996
Again.

557
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:01,834
Funeral's on... The funeral happened when?

558
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:03,252
Saturday.

559
00:57:03,336 --> 00:57:05,963
Funeral and what else? What else?

560
00:57:06,005 --> 00:57:08,048
What else? We have...

561
00:57:09,342 --> 00:57:11,760
Lithium is on Saturday.

562
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,431
Tuesday. Tuesday.

563
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:19,476
We have on Tuesday... We have...

564
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,061
Except for today.

565
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:24,690
Meet Dr. Roth on Tuesday,

566
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:26,275
and l am... Oh!

567
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:29,069
Committed Saturday

568
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:32,322
by Dr. Roth.

569
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:33,574
Bridgette's cuts happen on...

570
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:37,077
Bridgette! Bridgette!

571
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:38,328
Mommy.

572
00:57:38,371 --> 00:57:40,205
Tuesday.

573
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:43,083
Friday and Sunday are still open
and Wednesday.

574
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:47,713
You have one new message.

575
00:57:48,882 --> 00:57:51,425
-When?
-Yesterday.

576
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:54,511
Oh, God.

577
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,224
Jim dies

578
00:58:01,561 --> 00:58:02,728
Wednesday.

579
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:05,564
What you doing?

580
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:16,492
-Jim, don't go on this trip, please.
-l have to.

581
00:58:17,076 --> 00:58:19,077
We waited a year for this interview.

582
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:21,413
Besides, it could be good for us, you know?

583
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:24,374
Take a break from each other.

584
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:27,961
Well, it might be a bigger break
than you bargained for.

585
00:58:28,963 --> 00:58:31,798
What if something happens to you?

586
00:58:31,883 --> 00:58:34,426
Something could happen to me
on my way home from work.

587
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,637
-Should l stop working?
-Jim, l'm begging. You want me to beg?

588
00:58:36,721 --> 00:58:40,098
l will beg. Please, just don't go.
You have children and you have a family.

589
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:42,017
Why are you saying that?
You think l've forgotten that?

590
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:43,435
-No, l haven't...
-Because l haven't!

591
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,145
l realize that.
l didn't say that you've forgotten.

592
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,271
-All right. Good.
-Just listen to me.

593
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:47,940
-l need for you to listen to me.
-No, just stop it.

594
00:58:47,982 --> 00:58:50,234
-No, just listen to me.
-Stop it. Stop it.

595
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:53,529
Just do me one favor.

596
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:57,574
lf tomorrow's Wednesday,
just please wake me up before you leave.

597
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,952
-lf tomorrow's Wednesday?
-Just... l know it sounds crazy.

598
00:59:00,119 --> 00:59:02,788
Just please wake me up, okay?

599
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:04,081
Jesus.

600
00:59:04,123 --> 00:59:05,499
Promise me.

601
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:09,503
l promise.

602
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:11,380
Okay.

603
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:53,839
Oh, that guest bed is just awful.

604
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:55,007
Mom.

605
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:57,843
That's right. You stayed over.

606
00:59:57,885 --> 01:00:00,637
-Did you forget l was here?
-No, no, no. No, l remember.

607
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:03,181
l remember, now.
So that would have to be Friday.

608
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,684
Friday morning. Friday morning.

609
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,693
All right. All right.
Okay. There's two days left.

610
01:00:16,195 --> 01:00:18,155
This is Sunday and there's Friday.

611
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:19,823
How do we know that? Shit! Shit!

612
01:00:19,866 --> 01:00:21,450
-Are you all right?
-Shit!

613
01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:23,827
Claire. Claire Francis. Who's Claire Francis?

614
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,955
Who's Claire? Who's Claire?
Who's Claire Francis?

615
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,334
-We taIked?
-Well, yeah, yesterday. You don't remember?

616
01:00:30,376 --> 01:00:32,919
Claire. Claire. Yeah.

617
01:00:42,555 --> 01:00:44,014
Mom, l have to go.

618
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:47,976
What? You need to be with the girls.
You had the shock of your life yesterday.

619
01:00:48,061 --> 01:00:49,519
Tell me about it.

620
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:23,720
ls there something
we should be talking about?

621
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:29,935
Something involving my husband?

622
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:36,900
Who told you?

623
01:01:40,113 --> 01:01:41,947
l think you just did.

624
01:01:45,785 --> 01:01:47,786
He was gonna cheat on me.

625
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:50,247
He what?

626
01:01:51,999 --> 01:01:55,711
Well, wait a minute.
How do you know? How did you find out?

627
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,796
Because l talked to her.
She told me everything.

628
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,339
-When?
-Today.

629
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,801
Oh, hon, l'm sorry.

630
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:05,011
-Are you still in shock?
-No.

631
01:02:06,806 --> 01:02:09,516
No, l passed up shock a couple days ago.

632
01:02:10,810 --> 01:02:12,769
The whole thing is bad.

633
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:16,523
The accident, the other woman, it's a mess.

634
01:02:16,607 --> 01:02:18,734
l don't know if it's so bad.

635
01:02:20,778 --> 01:02:23,280
You know,
maybe it was supposed to happen.

636
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:24,990
What do you mean?

637
01:02:27,660 --> 01:02:30,328
Even though he didn't do anything yet.

638
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:33,540
The damage that it would have caused us,
the girls.

639
01:02:35,501 --> 01:02:38,253
Maybe it was enough that he was going to.

640
01:02:40,173 --> 01:02:42,466
Are you listening to what you're saying?

641
01:02:42,508 --> 01:02:44,217
We were roommates, Annie.

642
01:02:44,844 --> 01:02:49,264
We were roommates with two girls,
and my roommate was a liar.

643
01:03:12,538 --> 01:03:15,540
Well, as far as your mortgage
and your daughters' education,

644
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:17,000
it should all be taken care of.

645
01:03:17,043 --> 01:03:18,585
And with the annuity Jim left you,

646
01:03:18,669 --> 01:03:21,546
you should be pretty much set
income-wise, so...

647
01:03:25,843 --> 01:03:29,971
You know, Linda, l have to tell you,
the timing on all this...

648
01:03:30,056 --> 01:03:32,432
Timing? What do you mean, timing?

649
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:35,852
Jim stopped in to see me
Wednesday morning, right before his trip.

650
01:03:35,895 --> 01:03:37,646
-Wednesday?
-Yeah.

651
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:41,858
And he seemed very anxious,
like he wasn't quite sure of things,

652
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:45,737
and he kept talking about you and the girls,
and he said that,

653
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:49,741
no matter what happened,
he wanted to make sure you're all okay.

654
01:03:49,784 --> 01:03:52,410
And then he tripled his death benefits.

655
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:54,830
l mean, it's not a problem.

656
01:03:54,914 --> 01:03:56,832
The police reports
all confirm it was an accident.

657
01:03:56,916 --> 01:03:59,584
So, l'll just get this cleared
through the main office

658
01:03:59,627 --> 01:04:02,629
and l should have a check for you
fairly soon.

659
01:04:27,321 --> 01:04:28,905
Nice view, huh?

660
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:33,451
Yes, very.

661
01:04:34,453 --> 01:04:36,121
You have a family?

662
01:04:40,626 --> 01:04:43,086
l have two daughters but...

663
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:46,590
lt's no big deal.

664
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,467
Happens to a lot of people.

665
01:04:49,510 --> 01:04:51,386
They drive by here just like you did.

666
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:54,848
See the houses by this beautiful lake
and suddenly say to themselves,

667
01:04:54,932 --> 01:04:57,183
"What a great place to start over."

668
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:01,521
l moved here after my divorce.

669
01:05:02,982 --> 01:05:04,232
Really?

670
01:05:04,817 --> 01:05:06,484
Yeah, it's great.

671
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:10,196
lt's like a whole new life.

672
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:17,495
This moss pink velvet is very nice.

673
01:05:17,538 --> 01:05:20,123
l believe l would like that for the showroom.
And...

674
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:22,959
Miss Dwight, l'll have to call you back.
Thank you.

675
01:05:24,587 --> 01:05:26,171
Hello.

676
01:05:26,213 --> 01:05:27,881

Got it?

679
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:43,605
-Hi, honey.
-Hi, Mom.

680
01:05:45,441 --> 01:05:46,691
Hey, you.

01:05:52,031 --> 01:05:53,740
-One for you.
-Cool.

01:05:54,825 --> 01:05:56,368
-Thanks.
-And one for you.

683
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:58,787
-Thank you, Mommy.
-You're welcome.

684
01:05:59,872 --> 01:06:02,415
You know how much l love you, right?

685
01:06:14,345 --> 01:06:16,429
-Linda?
-Yeah.

686
01:06:18,349 --> 01:06:20,058
l don't want to upset you.

687
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:21,643
What is it, Mom?

688
01:06:21,727 --> 01:06:23,895
l know this is very difficult,

689
01:06:23,938 --> 01:06:27,315
but l really do think we need to
drive out to the funeral home, dear.

690
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,776
-l'll go with you.
-Oh, it's done.

691
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:33,697
-What?
-l already made all the arrangements.

692
01:06:35,282 --> 01:06:36,282
Oh.

693
01:06:37,618 --> 01:06:40,203
Well, when were you thinking
of having the...

694
01:06:40,246 --> 01:06:42,622
The funeral is tomorrow.

695
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:44,165
lt's all set.

696
01:06:44,250 --> 01:06:46,459
-Saturday?
-Saturday.

697
01:06:46,544 --> 01:06:49,462
-That soon?
-Yes, that soon.

698
01:07:13,904 --> 01:07:15,405
You okay, hon?

699
01:07:19,493 --> 01:07:20,785
Hey, Mom?

700
01:07:25,291 --> 01:07:27,125
lf l let Jim die,

701
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:32,630
is that the same thing as killing him?

702
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:38,887
Honey, Jim's already dead.

703
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:49,481
Good night, dear.

704
01:08:43,035 --> 01:08:47,205
With silver buttons, buttons, buttons
all down her shoe, shoe, shoe.

705
01:08:47,289 --> 01:08:50,583
She asked her grandma, grandma, grandma

706
01:08:50,668 --> 01:08:54,546
for a hundred dollars, dollars, dollars

707
01:08:54,588 --> 01:08:57,841
to see the bunnies, bunnies, bunnies

708
01:08:57,883 --> 01:09:01,344
jump over the house, house, house.

709
01:09:01,387 --> 01:09:05,390
They jumped so high, high, high
they reached the sky, sky, sky.

710
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:07,976
Girls, can you keep it down, please?

711
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:16,526
lt's Sunday.

712
01:09:18,154 --> 01:09:19,737
All day long.

713
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:27,328
Hey, why don't you take the girls
out for a while? You know?

714
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:30,206
You guys should spend some time together.

715
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:32,250
You can go have some fun.

716
01:09:32,585 --> 01:09:35,461
Yeah. Okay. That's a good idea.

717
01:09:39,258 --> 01:09:41,676
You girls want Daddy to make you
some pancakes for breakfast?

718
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:43,428
Yeah!

719
01:10:28,766 --> 01:10:30,266
Hello, Father.

720
01:10:32,811 --> 01:10:33,978
Linda.

721
01:10:35,105 --> 01:10:36,981
lt's been a long time.

722
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,781
l'm scared, Father.

723
01:10:50,287 --> 01:10:52,747
l want another piece of bread!

724
01:10:55,459 --> 01:10:57,502
Come on, green head! Get it!

725
01:10:59,088 --> 01:11:04,259
1 632, Dutch trading colony
off the coast of Carolina.

726
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:08,346
An hysterical midwife claimed to have
walked through the aftermath

727
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:11,266
of a terrible hurricane
that hadn't happened yet.

728
01:11:12,184 --> 01:11:15,103
-So, what happened?
-They hung her for being a witch.

729
01:11:16,188 --> 01:11:17,814
Two days later,

730
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:21,693
the entire town was wiped out
by a gale force hurricane.

731
01:11:22,486 --> 01:11:24,153
That's awful.

732
01:11:24,196 --> 01:11:26,614
l'll skip ahead to the 20th century.

733
01:11:27,866 --> 01:11:29,575
Boston. 1 91 8.

734
01:11:30,619 --> 01:11:33,413
At the height of the influenza epidemic,

735
01:11:33,497 --> 01:11:36,082
a father told friends he'd been to the future

736
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:39,210
and seen the graves
of his two small children.

737
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:42,964
He went insane and shot them both
to spare them the disease.

738
01:11:43,048 --> 01:11:44,716
Oh, my God.

739
01:11:44,800 --> 01:11:48,094
The autopsy showed
the children were never infected.

740
01:11:48,762 --> 01:11:50,972
He shot himself a week later.

741
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:56,060
Who are these people? Why did it happen?

742
01:11:56,103 --> 01:12:00,898
You see,
history's full of unexplained phenomena.

743
01:12:01,900 --> 01:12:03,443
Nobody knows why.

744
01:12:04,236 --> 01:12:08,573
Some people thought they suffered
from what the ancients called

745
01:12:09,616 --> 01:12:12,327
Blasphemare absens fides.

746
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:15,663
The dangers of the faithless.

747
01:12:16,915 --> 01:12:18,416
The faithless?

748
01:12:18,459 --> 01:12:23,838
lt's the notion that nature abhors a vacuum,
even a spiritual one.

749
01:12:25,549 --> 01:12:27,925
People who've lost their beliefs,

750
01:12:29,345 --> 01:12:32,013
they're like empty vessels,

751
01:12:32,097 --> 01:12:34,640
more susceptible to having their lives
taken over

752
01:12:34,725 --> 01:12:37,268
by forces bigger than themselves.

753
01:12:37,311 --> 01:12:39,270
Almost like a curse.

754
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,064
Or a miracle.

755
01:12:42,691 --> 01:12:45,443
Yeah, well, l don't believe in miracles.

756
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:48,488
Every day we're alive
can be a miracle, Linda.

757
01:12:49,615 --> 01:12:51,616
Well, it doesn't feel that way.

758
01:12:52,284 --> 01:12:53,701
Not for me.

759
01:12:55,496 --> 01:13:00,249
Father, something bad is going to happen.

760
01:13:01,377 --> 01:13:06,089
l need your... l need your help.
l need your direction. l need faith.

761
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:12,428
Faith is just
believing in something beyond yourself,

762
01:13:13,389 --> 01:13:18,309
something you can't feel, or smell, or touch,

763
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:21,312
like hope or love.

764
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,734
l believe l've let that all go.

765
01:13:28,987 --> 01:13:32,156
Maybe you should try
and get it back again, huh?

766
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:33,825
But if it's too late...

767
01:13:33,867 --> 01:13:38,955
lt's never too late
to realize what's important in your life,

768
01:13:38,997 --> 01:13:40,790
to fight for it.

769
01:13:42,543 --> 01:13:44,836
l don't know what to fight for.

770
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:04,874
He was on the highway,
around miIe marker 220.

771
01:15:09,755 --> 01:15:11,130
Mrs. Hanson?

772
01:15:14,051 --> 01:15:15,343
Ma'am?

773
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:18,930
who are these people? why did it happen?

774
01:15:19,014 --> 01:15:20,765
History's full of unexplained phenomenon.

775
01:15:20,807 --> 01:15:22,141
Bridgette! No, Bridgette!

776
01:15:22,226 --> 01:15:23,392
Nobody knows why.

777
01:15:23,435 --> 01:15:25,603
Open it up! Open it up! No!

778
01:15:25,687 --> 01:15:28,940
Obviously, you're dealing
with some inconsistencies.

779
01:15:28,982 --> 01:15:30,149
No!

780
01:15:30,442 --> 01:15:31,943
Dangers of the faithless.

781
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:33,444
I'm CIaire Francis.

782
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:35,821
Your husband's been really helpful
the Iast few weeks.

783
01:15:35,906 --> 01:15:37,490
Jim.

784
01:15:37,574 --> 01:15:40,701
How do you feel during the times he's dead?

785
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:42,828
we don't want anyone getting hurt now,
do we?

786
01:15:42,913 --> 01:15:44,121
If I Iet Jim die...

787
01:15:44,164 --> 01:15:45,581
It's never too Iate.

788
01:15:45,624 --> 01:15:47,583
...is that the same thing as killing him?

789
01:15:47,626 --> 01:15:48,960
Inconsistencies.

790
01:15:49,044 --> 01:15:51,087
The same thing as killing him?

791
01:16:24,162 --> 01:16:27,373
-Did you guys have a good time?
-Yeah. Yeah.

792
01:16:27,457 --> 01:16:29,208
We had a great time.

793
01:16:31,044 --> 01:16:32,169
Good.

794
01:16:59,364 --> 01:17:01,490
Let me help you with that.

795
01:17:04,369 --> 01:17:05,745
Smells good.

796
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:25,348
Oh, good girls.

797
01:17:28,518 --> 01:17:29,560
Night.

798
01:17:29,603 --> 01:17:31,771
-Night.
-Night.

799
01:17:31,855 --> 01:17:33,606
Good night, baby.

800
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:35,483
Come here. Give me a kiss.

801
01:17:35,567 --> 01:17:38,736
Hey, why don't you girls go give
your dad another hug, nice and tight?

802
01:17:38,820 --> 01:17:40,237
-Okay.
-Okay.

803
01:17:42,574 --> 01:17:44,033
What's this all about?

804
01:17:44,076 --> 01:17:46,577
-Mama said to give you extra hugs.
-Yeah.

805
01:17:46,662 --> 01:17:50,456
Extra hugs?
Oh, how about extra hugs and extra kisses?

806
01:17:52,709 --> 01:17:54,669
Now, off to bed. Go brush your teeth.

807
01:17:54,753 --> 01:17:57,588
Hey, girls, why don't you tell Daddy
how much you love him?

808
01:17:57,631 --> 01:17:59,465
-Love you, Daddy.
-Me, too!

809
01:17:59,549 --> 01:18:01,425
Well, thank you, ladies.

810
01:18:04,429 --> 01:18:06,555
Aren't you gonna tell them?

811
01:18:07,099 --> 01:18:09,600
-Tell them what?
-That you love them.

812
01:18:11,311 --> 01:18:13,437
You do love them, don't you?

813
01:18:14,981 --> 01:18:16,565
Of course l do.

814
01:18:17,442 --> 01:18:18,943
Then tell them.

815
01:18:22,572 --> 01:18:25,116
You girls know how much l love you, right?

816
01:18:25,158 --> 01:18:26,951
Huh? Right?

817
01:18:27,536 --> 01:18:30,955
l love you more than anything
in the whole wide world.

818
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:34,917
Mom, too?

819
01:18:36,586 --> 01:18:38,295
More than anything?

820
01:18:44,636 --> 01:18:46,387
l do love your mom.

821
01:18:47,889 --> 01:18:49,682
l love her very much.

822
01:19:13,123 --> 01:19:14,290
Linda!

823
01:19:24,593 --> 01:19:26,719
What are you doing out here?

824
01:19:32,184 --> 01:19:34,310
Honey, let's go back inside.

825
01:19:35,228 --> 01:19:37,229
How did we get here, Jim?

826
01:19:38,857 --> 01:19:40,232
l miss you!

827
01:19:40,859 --> 01:19:42,359
l miss us!

828
01:19:42,444 --> 01:19:44,528
There's still an us.
lt's just different now, that's all.

829
01:19:44,613 --> 01:19:46,947
-Why? Why is it different?
-l don't know why.

830
01:19:47,032 --> 01:19:50,785
-What did you expect us to be like?
-Just the way we used to be!

831
01:19:52,621 --> 01:19:56,874
Linda, look at us. We're married.
We got a house, a mortgage, two kids!

832
01:19:56,958 --> 01:19:59,710
Why do we have to talk about this now?
Why can't we just go inside?

833
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:02,213
Because we're running out of time!

834
01:20:11,723 --> 01:20:13,057
Watch out!

835
01:21:55,368 --> 01:21:56,702
l'm sorry.

836
01:22:00,165 --> 01:22:01,665
l'm so sorry.

837
01:22:59,599 --> 01:23:02,977
What?

838
01:23:05,271 --> 01:23:07,022
You have that look.

839
01:23:08,733 --> 01:23:10,067
What look?

840
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:14,905
Like you want to tell me something.

841
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:26,750
l had a dream you're gonna die.

842
01:23:31,423 --> 01:23:33,298
That was only a dream.

843
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:36,635
Everything's gonna be fine.

844
01:23:55,321 --> 01:23:56,447
Hello.

845
01:23:56,489 --> 01:23:58,449
Annie! Annie, what day is it today?

846
01:23:58,533 --> 01:24:01,827
lt's Wednesday, it's Wednesday.
What's the matter?

847
01:24:01,911 --> 01:24:02,995
Shit!

848
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:05,789
Girls? Girls? Jim?

849
01:24:07,459 --> 01:24:11,086
Jim?

850
01:24:11,921 --> 01:24:13,172
Shoot.

851
01:24:15,425 --> 01:24:18,385
"Took the girls to school.
Be back tomorrow."

852
01:24:21,514 --> 01:24:23,390
Answer the phone.

853
01:24:23,475 --> 01:24:24,933

Jim? ls something wrong?

Yeah.

01:25:48,685 --> 01:25:50,060
l'm sorry, l can't.

864
01:25:51,062 --> 01:25:52,646
l can't do this.

01:27:13,269 --> 01:27:15,604
-You do?
-Yeah.

-Jim, do you love me? Do you trust me?

-Turn it around.

894

898
01:28:36,227 --> 01:28:37,436
Jim.

899
01:28:38,563 --> 01:28:41,898
Can you hear me? Are you okay?
Baby, can you hear me?

900
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:45,902
Sorry, l dropped the phone.

901
01:28:45,987 --> 01:28:47,571
l love you.

902
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:48,947
Let's go home.

903
01:28:49,032 --> 01:28:50,407
Okay. Hold on.

904
01:28:53,077 --> 01:28:54,578
Stalled it.

905
01:29:00,460 --> 01:29:02,419
Oh, no. Oh, no.

906
01:29:03,546 --> 01:29:10,135
Jim. Jim, get out of the car.

907
01:29:13,056 --> 01:29:14,264
Jesus.

908
01:29:15,975 --> 01:29:17,476
Jim! Jim! Get...

909
01:29:19,395 --> 01:29:20,771
Shit.

910
01:29:22,690 --> 01:29:24,441
Get out of the car.

911
01:29:27,528 --> 01:29:28,820
Oh, my God!

912
01:29:38,956 --> 01:29:41,291
Jim, get out of the car!

913
01:29:56,849 --> 01:29:57,974
Jim!

914
01:30:00,144 --> 01:30:01,311
Baby!

915
01:31:10,715 --> 01:31:12,549
Mommy, they're here.

916
01:31:14,886 --> 01:31:17,053
Oh, baby, l must have fallen asleep.

917
01:31:17,138 --> 01:31:20,056
-The moving truck is here.
-l know. l heard.

918
01:31:21,809 --> 01:31:23,477
Healing so nicely.

919
01:31:26,230 --> 01:31:28,732
Why don't you guys go downstairs?
l'll be there in a second, okay?

920
01:31:28,774 --> 01:31:30,192
-Okay.
-Okay.

921
01:31:49,086 --> 01:31:52,923
Faith is just
believing in something beyond yourself,

922
01:31:54,091 --> 01:31:56,426
like hope or love.

923
01:31:59,055 --> 01:32:03,767
lt's never too late
to realize what's important in your life,

924
01:32:03,851 --> 01:32:05,477
to fight for it.

925
01:32:06,938 --> 01:32:09,272
l don't know what to fight for.

926
01:33:07,915 --> 01:33:10,875
Every day we're alive can be a miracle.
