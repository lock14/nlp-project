00:00:56,923 --> 00:01:01,758
<i>(woman) At the centre of our existence</i>
<i>is a powerful dynamo.</i>

3
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:06,888
<i>The sun.</i>

4
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:11,903
<i>It gives us heat and light,</i>
<i>and drives the great engine of life.</i>

5
00:01:46,072 --> 00:01:49,599
<i>It's the food chain,</i>
<i>and we're all a part of it.</i>

6
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:57,013
<i>No matter who you are,</i>
<i>even if you're a hardcore meat-eater,</i>

7
00:01:57,083 --> 00:02:01,850
<i>your dinner started with plants</i>
<i>somewhere turning sunlight into food.</i>

8
00:02:01,921 --> 00:02:05,288
<i>So we are, all of us,</i>

9
00:02:05,725 --> 00:02:07,886
<i>solar powered.</i>

10
00:02:13,933 --> 00:02:18,393
<i>Maybe the ancient Egyptians</i>
<i>were right to worship the sun.</i>

11
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:22,805
<i>For four billion years,</i>
<i>the sun has given life to everything,</i>

12
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,777
<i>on land, and in the sea.</i>

13
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:45,525
Rover One, this is Rover Two<i>,</i>

14
00:02:45,598 --> 00:02:50,797
We are at the edge of the wall
and are beginning our descent<i>,</i> Over<i>,</i>

15
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:55,569
<i>My name's Dijanna Figueroa, and I'm</i>
<i>a PhD student at UC Santa Barbara.</i>

16
00:02:55,642 --> 00:02:59,578
- This is cool<i>,</i>
<i>- (man) Copy that. Starting descent. Over.</i>

17
00:02:59,646 --> 00:03:03,138
<i>(Dijanna) I think I have</i>
<i>one of the coolest jobs in the world.</i>

18
00:03:03,216 --> 00:03:05,912
<i>(Dijanna)</i> Check out those
corkscrew coral down there<i>,</i>

19
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:09,648
<i>I'm a marine biologist.</i>
<i>I get to go to the bottom of the ocean</i>

20
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:13,351
<i>and study the amazing organisms</i>
<i>that live there.</i>

21
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:16,759
<i>There's nothing I'd rather be doing.</i>

22
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,992
<i>(man on radio) Rover One, Rover One,</i>
<i>do you copy?</i>

23
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,026
<i>(man)</i> This wall's pretty amazing<i>,</i>

24
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:29,336
We're barely on the edge
of photosynthesis right here<i>,</i>

25
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:32,367
Ambient light's really going now<i>,</i>

26
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:41,212
<i>(Dijanna) You're totally reliant on</i>
<i>the technology that's in your little bubble</i>

27
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:45,314
<i>to dive to that depth</i>
<i>where it's just a mystery down there.</i>

28
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,382
<i>You never know what you're gonna see.</i>

29
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:51,021
<i>- (man)</i> Look at all that krill<i>,</i>
- Oh, my gosh!

30
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:59,964
<i>(Dijanna)</i> Looks like we're in
krill heaven over here, Rover One<i>,</i>

31
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:04,100
<i>(man on radio) Yeah, roger that.</i>
<i>Pretty incredible.</i>

32
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:22,255
Not seeing much of anything alive here,
Dijanna<i>,</i> What about you?

33
00:04:22,328 --> 00:04:26,822
<i>(Dijanna)</i> Not much life at all<i>,</i> I think
we're pretty much out of the photic zone<i>,</i>

34
00:04:26,899 --> 00:04:29,527
<i>(man on radio) It's like being on the moon,</i>
<i>huh?</i>

35
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,593
Copy that<i>,</i>

36
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,272
<i>(man)</i> Hey, look,
we got a crinoid right down here<i>,</i>

37
00:04:36,342 --> 00:04:40,506
<i>(man) Hey, Dijanna, we got a crinoid here.</i>
<i>We finally found a citizen.</i>

38
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:43,242
<i>(Dijanna)</i> Copy that<i>,</i>

39
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:46,342
Yeah, it looks like we're getting deeper,
and most of the animals down here

40
00:04:46,419 --> 00:04:50,913
look like they're suspension feeders,
or particle feeders<i>,</i>

41
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:56,895
<i>(Dijanna) With no light from the surface,</i>
<i>not much can survive down here.</i>

42
00:04:57,897 --> 00:05:01,663
<i>But there are places in the ocean</i>
<i>where sunlight has never reached,</i>

43
00:05:01,734 --> 00:05:07,138
<i>not since the world began,</i>
<i>and yet amazing life forms thrive there.</i>

44
00:05:07,907 --> 00:05:12,571
<i>So when I was invited to join the new</i>
<i>expedition to explore these places,</i>

45
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:15,113
<i>I had to say yes.</i>

46
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,915
<i>(man on radio) "Keldysh," "Keldysh,"</i>
<i>"Ares" bridge.</i>

47
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,547
<i>(man #2)</i> Yeah, Dave,
we're about to begin dive reef right now<i>,</i>

48
00:05:23,623 --> 00:05:27,218
We got MIR One
going into the water at<i>,,,</i>

49
00:05:29,562 --> 00:05:33,089
Like this, so that we've got a central area
to work<i>,</i> Rover One is gonna stay<i>,,,</i>

50
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:35,726
<i>I'm Jim Cameron,</i>
<i>and here's the deal.</i>

51
00:05:35,802 --> 00:05:37,793
<i>I love this stuff.</i>

52
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:42,204
<i>Exploration. Real honest-to-God</i>
<i>deep ocean exploration.</i>

53
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:47,406
<i>This is way more exciting than</i>
<i>any made-up Hollywood special effects.</i>

54
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,109
<i>These deep ocean expeditions</i>
<i>always seem like space missions to me.</i>

55
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:54,915
<i>So, why not combine</i>
<i>outer space and inner space?</i>

56
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,856
<i>Sure, we'll take marine biologists.</i>

57
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:12,962
<i>But why not take astrobiologists</i>
<i>and space researchers?</i>

58
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,803
<i>So that's how a bunch</i>
<i>of space scientists wound up out here,</i>

59
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,139
<i>a thousand miles from the nearest land,</i>

60
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:20,907
<i>where, right under our feet,</i>
<i>down in the darkness,</i>

61
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:25,610
<i>are the most insane alien life forms</i>
<i>that have ever been discovered.</i>

62
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,619
<i>Two ships,</i>

63
00:06:27,687 --> 00:06:30,087
<i>four manned submersibles,</i>

64
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:35,150
<i>forty dives at ten sites</i>
<i>in both the Atlantic and Pacific.</i>

65
00:06:36,963 --> 00:06:39,727
<i>I like big operations,</i>
<i>but this one was off the hook.</i>

66
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:44,759
So we'll come down together, like this, and
we'll try to stay a couple of meters apart,

67
00:06:44,837 --> 00:06:46,771
because we don't want to drift off<i>,</i>

68
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:49,933
If the communications are compromised
with the multiple subs in the water,

69
00:06:50,009 --> 00:06:53,467
all working on the same frequency,
some in Russian, some in English,

70
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,912
I want to make sure
we stay on visual<i>,,,</i>

71
00:06:55,982 --> 00:06:58,678
<i>(Jim) The plan was</i>
<i>to coordinate a four-sub dive,</i>

72
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:04,121
<i>using both ships, so two MIRs and two</i>
<i>Rovers could rendezvous at the bottom.</i>

73
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,750
<i>This would be a world first.</i>

74
00:07:06,826 --> 00:07:09,454
- Hi<i>,</i>
- Dr<i>,</i> Sagalevitch<i>,</i>

75
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:12,521
<i>(Jim) Anatoly Sagalevitch heads</i>
<i>the Manned Submersibles Laboratory</i>

76
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:15,089
<i>for the Russian</i>
<i>Academy of Sciences.</i>

77
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,363
<i>We've been working together</i>
<i>for almost a decade.</i>

78
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,132
There we are<i>,</i>

79
00:07:19,205 --> 00:07:21,400
The adventurers<i>,</i>

80
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:25,467
It's all his fault that we're doing this,
because we did <i>Titanic</i> twice,

81
00:07:25,545 --> 00:07:27,945
in '95 and '01,
and we did <i>Bismarck.</i>

82
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:30,778
Sometime around the middle
of <i>Bismarck,</i> Anatoly says:

83
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:32,943
"You know, these wrecks are good,
they're interesting,

84
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:35,317
but you have to do something real<i>,</i>"

85
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:37,982
"We have to do some science<i>,</i>
Something real<i>,</i>"

86
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:42,089
<i>(Jim) Genya Chernaiev</i>
<i>is one of the Russian MIR pilots.</i>

87
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:45,358
<i>He's been flying submersibles</i>
<i>for over 20 years now.</i>

88
00:07:45,431 --> 00:07:48,832
The most important thing about this boat,
of course, is the view<i>,</i>

89
00:07:48,901 --> 00:07:51,495
320 degrees unobstructed<i>,</i>

90
00:07:51,571 --> 00:07:53,903
<i>(Jim) This view makes the Rovers unique,</i>

91
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:57,841
<i>but because of the acrylic sphere,</i>
<i>they can't go as deep as the MIRs.</i>

92
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:02,108
<i>So they'd only be joining us</i>
<i>for the Atlantic leg of the journey.</i>

93
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,283
<i>We also had Jake,</i>
<i>the little remotely operated 'bot</i>

94
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:10,254
<i>we'd used to explore</i>
<i>the Titanic and Bismarck wrecks.</i>

95
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:14,316
<i>Jake had been modified</i>
<i>to test a variety of sampling tools.</i>

96
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:19,154
<i>My brother Mike is Jake's inventor</i>
<i>and our pilot on this expedition.</i>

97
00:08:19,232 --> 00:08:23,601
<i>His challenge was to steer Jake safely</i>
<i>around the volcanically active vent sites,</i>

98
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,194
<i>and not fry our little 'bot.</i>

99
00:08:26,272 --> 00:08:28,797
<i>This would hopefully allow us</i>
<i>to get up close and personal</i>

100
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:31,810
<i>with the creatures we'd come to see.</i>

101
00:08:31,878 --> 00:08:35,336
We've checked the decks twice,
all the rigging looks squared away<i>,</i>

102
00:08:35,414 --> 00:08:37,814
<i>My other brother was with us too.</i>

103
00:08:37,884 --> 00:08:41,820
<i>JD was the safety and communications</i>
<i>officer on board the "Ares."</i>

104
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:44,982
<i>Or, as he called it,</i>
<i>"crap job number 27."</i>

105
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:49,084
Our launch procedure is as per the book<i>,</i>
Everything's straightforward<i>,</i>

106
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:53,291
She's first, she's second<i>,</i> Recovery
is determined by Jim from the bottom<i>,</i>

107
00:08:53,366 --> 00:08:55,197
Now, recovery can go either way<i>,</i>

108
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:03,801
<i>(Jim) We chose the "Ares"</i>
<i>for the giant A-frame at her stern.</i>

109
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,814
<i>(Jim) Its massive hydraulic cylinders</i>
<i>can lift the sub off the deck</i>

110
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,381
<i>and out over the water with ease.</i>

111
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:25,487
<i>It's one of the safest ways</i>
<i>to launch a large payload off of any ship,</i>

112
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,399
<i>and we constantly tested our procedures</i>
<i>until we had everything dialed in</i>

113
00:09:29,468 --> 00:09:32,062
<i>for the upcoming four-sub dive.</i>

114
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:38,336
<i>(JD)</i> All right, let's do this<i>,</i>
All stations, let's do this<i>,</i>

115
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:42,711
<i>(Jim)</i> I'm gonna need everybody
to keep their ears open, be observant<i>,</i>

116
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:45,444
Keep your eyes open
for the lights of the other submersibles<i>,</i>

117
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:49,386
And, you know, it's gonna be challenging<i>,</i>
But I think we can pull it off<i>,</i>

118
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:52,151
All right, here we go<i>,</i>
Jacks up!

119
00:09:52,224 --> 00:09:55,591
<i>(Jim) Finally, everything was in motion.</i>

120
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,099
<i>And in the middle of the North Atlantic,</i>

121
00:10:01,167 --> 00:10:04,398
<i>a thousand miles from the nearest land,</i>

122
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:11,632
<i>our little expedition</i>
<i>was about to make history.</i>

123
00:10:11,711 --> 00:10:14,043
We're in motion<i>,</i>
We're in motion<i>,</i>

124
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:17,276
<i>(man speaks Russian)</i>

125
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,751
Nice and slow, blue winch<i>,</i>
Nice and slow<i>,</i>

126
00:10:24,824 --> 00:10:27,315
- Now we're gunnin' runnin', huh?
<i>- (man)</i> Yeah<i>,</i>

127
00:10:27,393 --> 00:10:29,861
<i>(Jim) At least, that was the plan.</i>

128
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,329
<i>(JD)</i> All stop, all stop<i>,</i> All stop<i>,</i>

129
00:10:38,237 --> 00:10:40,831
<i>(man on radio) I copy you, Lima Charlie.</i>
<i>The only problem we have right now</i>

130
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,670
<i>is the A-frame. Over.</i>

131
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:47,110
<i>I'll let you know</i>
<i>as soon as the crew gets it sorted.</i>

132
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:51,115
<i>(JD)</i> About an hour and 15 minutes
ago, we had a safety stop<i>,</i>

133
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:54,448
Uh, what we know
is the A-frame went south<i>,</i>

134
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:59,686
It's a complete breakdown of the cylinder<i>,</i>
It ultimately amounts to a cold stop<i>,</i>

135
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:02,023
These bolts all shot<i>,</i>

136
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:07,191
And all this paint that's been here forever
busts loose because of that situation<i>,</i>

137
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,996
And it happened on that one as well<i>,</i>

138
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,802
<i>(Jim)</i> Yeah, right<i>,</i> I mean, we're in the
middle of the ocean with a broken A-frame<i>,</i>

139
00:11:13,873 --> 00:11:15,898
That's what it sounds like to me<i>,</i>

140
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:18,068
How you gonna get that fixed up?

141
00:11:18,144 --> 00:11:22,012
Call A-frames"R"Us? You know,
have their little service ship come by?

142
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:24,914
Thousand miles from shore?

143
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,308
We don't have to move on it immediately,

144
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:31,914
but it's at least something
we need to start processing<i>,</i>

145
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:35,890
Well, I mean,
if they can't fix this,

146
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:40,022
and we don't have an alternate way
of launching the sub, it's over,

147
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,158
the expedition's over<i>,</i>

148
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,664
<i>(Jim) If you are going to explore,</i>
<i>you have to accept the fact</i>

149
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:48,764
<i>that on the one hand there's risk.</i>
<i>You have to stay up all night long</i>

150
00:11:48,841 --> 00:11:51,537
<i>thinking about every single factor</i>
<i>that's involved in what you're doing,</i>

151
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:53,874
<i>and making sure that</i>
<i>you've thought of everything.</i>

152
00:11:53,946 --> 00:11:56,574
<i>'Cause if you can eliminate</i>
<i>all the things you can think of,</i>

153
00:11:56,649 --> 00:11:59,914
you've eliminated nine-tenths
of what can go wrong<i>,</i>

154
00:11:59,985 --> 00:12:04,183
That way, when that last one-tenth
pops up, and you're in the middle of it,

155
00:12:04,256 --> 00:12:07,054
you don't have to worry about all the
other stuff 'cause you've dealt with that<i>,</i>

156
00:12:07,126 --> 00:12:12,792
Look, to be completely serious, your idea
about cutting that bulwark away at the side

157
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:15,299
is the best idea I've heard
for an alternate plan yet<i>,</i>

158
00:12:15,367 --> 00:12:16,834
Just cut the side right out of the ship<i>,</i>

159
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:19,097
I say we go clear that
with the captain right now<i>,</i>

160
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:22,368
OK<i>,</i> Well, plan B<i>,</i>

161
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,330
All right,
we can talk it through tonight,

162
00:12:49,401 --> 00:12:52,234
but I don't think
we should try for an all-up drill tonight<i>,</i>

163
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:54,272
I mean, people have been up
since 4:30 in the morning<i>,</i>

164
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:08,983
<i>(JD) It became apparent that</i>
<i>the only way to get the subs off the "Ares"</i>

165
00:13:09,054 --> 00:13:14,720
<i>was to use the main crane and by sliding</i>
<i>the submersibles off the side of the vessel.</i>

166
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:21,063
<i>With a crane that is 30, 40, 50 feet above</i>
<i>the actual pick point of the submersible,</i>

167
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:25,035
<i>once an object starts to swing,</i>
<i>you can't stop it.</i>

168
00:13:26,438 --> 00:13:28,429
<i>It's called the wrecking-ball effect.</i>

169
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:31,772
<i>Once it gets away from you,</i>
<i>you can't get it back.</i>

170
00:13:34,947 --> 00:13:39,179
I'm guessing we've got six to eight feet of
travel here<i>,</i> I'm thinking we should use<i>,,,</i>

171
00:13:39,251 --> 00:13:42,846
<i>(JD) It ultimately resulted</i>
<i>in Jim writing a 40-page manual</i>

172
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:45,755
<i>on what he thought the best way</i>
<i>to launch the vessel was.</i>

173
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,452
This eye feeds into that<i>,,,</i>

174
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:51,690
<i>(man) So we spent a long time</i>
<i>devising four separate pick points,</i>

175
00:13:51,764 --> 00:13:54,961
<i>as well as eight different points</i>
<i>of connection to the submersible</i>

176
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:57,025
<i>to stop it from swaying.</i>

177
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:03,407
<i>We would practice all night long.</i>

178
00:14:03,475 --> 00:14:06,740
<i>At dawn the following day, we were ready</i>
<i>to attempt it for the first time.</i>

179
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:10,509
We spent the past 24 hours rebuilding
the entire launch and recovery system,

180
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:15,680
which required us to cut this wall out, rerig
every capstan, rerig every block and tackle<i>,</i>

181
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:20,452
We've got about
20 different points of rigging<i>,</i>

182
00:14:20,526 --> 00:14:23,188
Every single point
has to be checked by me, by hand<i>,</i>

183
00:14:23,262 --> 00:14:25,924
Any single point fails, anything,

184
00:14:25,998 --> 00:14:28,865
from the blue winch
to the cable itself, snaps, breaks,

185
00:14:28,934 --> 00:14:32,995
not only do we lose the sub, but we risk the
chance of losing somebody on the deck<i>,</i>

186
00:14:33,072 --> 00:14:36,530
I'm looking at every pulley
under tension, and it's looking at me<i>,</i>

187
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:44,242
<i>Keldysh,</i> be advised,
we are go for launch ops<i>,</i>

188
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:48,013
Deck crew, be advised we have 15
minutes before we start launch operation<i>,</i>

189
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:50,317
- Paul?
- Yeah, roger that, DP control<i>,</i>

190
00:14:50,389 --> 00:14:54,348
MIR One's going into
the water right now<i>,</i>

191
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:57,259
Let's see the crane, guys<i>,</i>

192
00:15:20,486 --> 00:15:23,216
- Oh, yes<i>,</i>
- Stow that, get on the line<i>,</i>

208
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:58,179
<i>(woman) The descent to Lost City</i>
<i>takes about 30 minutes,</i>

209
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:03,210
<i>which is plenty of time</i>
<i>to think about what you're about to do.</i>

<i>My name is Loretta Hidalgo,</i>
<i>and I'm an explorer.</i>

<i>(Loretta) My goal is to one day</i>
<i>explore the reaches of space.</i>

00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:24,306
<i>- (Loretta)</i> That is the bomb<i>,</i> Yeah!
<i>- (man)</i> We're at 840 meters<i>,</i>

216
00:17:35,788 --> 00:17:40,191
OK, there's the rendezvous point,

00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,561
MIR Two, MIR Two,
this is Rover Two<i>,</i> Do you copy?

219
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:58,338
<i>(Mike) That's affirmative, Rover Two.</i>
<i>We have a very good visual on you.</i>

220
00:18:00,779 --> 00:18:04,510
<i>(Loretta) We were doing something</i>
<i>that no humans had ever done.</i>

221
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:09,577
<i>This was the first time that four deep</i>
<i>submersibles had ever dived together.</i>

222
00:18:09,655 --> 00:18:14,092
<i>The water pressure that you get</i>
<i>down at 3,000 feet is mind-boggling.</i>

223
00:18:14,159 --> 00:18:17,617
<i>If you've ever carried a bucket of water,</i>
<i>you know that's about a foot of water.</i>

224
00:18:17,696 --> 00:18:20,927
<i>Now imagine being under</i>
<i>3,000 feet of water.</i>

225
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:23,797
<i>And all that weight</i>
<i>of all those buckets lined up on your head</i>

226
00:18:23,869 --> 00:18:27,066
<i>are all pressing down on you</i>
<i>and on the submarine.</i>

227
00:18:27,139 --> 00:18:30,540
<i>Definitely not something</i>
<i>that humans were evolved to do.</i>

228
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:34,978
OK<i>,</i> Loretta, can you relay to Mike
that we are in position for 'bot ops? Over<i>,</i>

229
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:37,676
Copy<i>,</i>

230
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:41,116
MIR Two, MIR Two,
are you go for 'bot deploy?

231
00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:46,019
Uh, roger that<i>,</i>
We'll get set for 'bot ops<i>,</i> Over<i>,</i>

232
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,653
- OK<i>,</i> There it is<i>,</i>
- Yeah, there he is<i>,</i>

233
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:50,126
There's Jake<i>,</i>

234
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:53,130
Can you see his tether spinning out?

235
00:18:53,198 --> 00:18:56,099
It's like a spider spinning its web<i>,</i>

236
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,140
I'm just gonna pull a little tether
out here, to the left, into the current,

237
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:07,770
and then I'll yaw back to the right<i>,</i>

238
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:10,178
<i>(Loretta) We were really</i>
<i>pushing the boundary</i>

239
00:19:10,249 --> 00:19:13,412
<i>of being out in</i>
<i>an extreme environment.</i>

240
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:19,584
<i>I had this incredible experience of feeling</i>
<i>like I'd been transported into the future.</i>

241
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,785
Hi, 'bot!

242

Hi, Mike<i>,</i>
Get me out of here<i>,</i>

245
00:19:36,108 --> 00:19:38,804
- Affirmative<i>,</i>
- Affirmative<i>,</i>

246
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:53,689
Push in a tiny bit in here,
and I get just right in as close as I can go<i>,</i>

247
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,296
<i>(Dijanna)</i> Oh, wow<i>,</i>
Are you seeing the structure?

248
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,629
<i>(Mike)</i> Yeah<i>,</i> Beautiful<i>,</i>

249
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:07,968
OK, Mike<i>,</i> If you come right
about 30 degrees, and come forward,

250
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:11,601
you'll come to a big fan right on
the corner of that rock<i>,</i> Over<i>,</i>

251
00:20:11,677 --> 00:20:13,838
<i>(Loretta) Copy that.</i>

252
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,782
<i>(Dijanna)</i> Oh, this is gorgeous<i>,</i>
I feel like I'm out there<i>,</i>

253
00:20:19,851 --> 00:20:22,820
<i>- (Mike)</i> Are you liking this?
- I'm loving this<i>,</i>

254
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:29,889
OK, I'm gonna have to come up a little bit<i>,</i>
Well, we're doing pretty good here<i>,</i>

255
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:34,899
I've encountered a little
more current than I expected right here<i>,</i>

256
00:20:34,967 --> 00:20:36,867
<i>(Dijanna)</i> Oh, my gosh!

257
00:20:36,935 --> 00:20:39,165
<i>(Mike)</i> Hello, Mr<i>,</i> Big<i>,</i>

258
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:43,504
<i>(Dijanna)</i> He's like,
"Don't even mess with me<i>,</i>"

259
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:46,544
Oh! Oh, my God<i>,</i>

260
00:20:49,781 --> 00:20:51,772
Wow<i>,</i>

261
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,011
Wow<i>,</i>

262
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:03,922
<i>(Dijanna) Kevin Hand</i>
<i>is one of our astrobiologists.</i>

263
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:06,021
<i>And he's a brilliant guy.</i>

264
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,998
<i>Really.</i>

265
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:11,126
That's one of the interesting things
I think about the Europan ocean,

266
00:21:11,203 --> 00:21:14,263
is that you can ask
two questions about life on Europa<i>,</i>

267
00:21:14,339 --> 00:21:17,502
Could life have originated on Europa?

268
00:21:17,576 --> 00:21:20,909
<i>(Dijanna) Astrobiology is</i>
<i>the study of life on other worlds.</i>

269
00:21:20,979 --> 00:21:25,575
<i>But since Kevin doesn't have any real</i>
<i>extraterrestrial specimens to analyze yet,</i>

270
00:21:25,651 --> 00:21:28,176
<i>he's out here doing</i>
<i>the next best thing:</i>

271
00:21:28,253 --> 00:21:33,190
<i>Looking at life in the extreme conditions</i>
<i>of the deep ocean.</i>

272
00:21:34,526 --> 00:21:37,859
<i>He's a theory guy</i>
<i>and he's never been to sea before,</i>

273
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:41,865
<i>let alone inside a submersible</i>
<i>headed to the bottom of the ocean.</i>

274
00:21:41,933 --> 00:21:44,697
Here we go<i>,</i>
Into the unknown<i>,</i>

275
00:22:04,189 --> 00:22:10,150
<i>(man) Rover Two, MIR Two copies you</i>
<i>loud and clear now. Loud and clear now.</i>

276
00:22:10,228 --> 00:22:12,560
<i>(radio chatter</i>

277
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:27,237
<i>(Kevin)</i> Yeah, it looks like
it goes down for a long ways<i>,</i>

278
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:32,548
MIR Two is right above us<i>,</i>

279
00:22:33,218 --> 00:22:37,621
Very few people get to see
MIR Two from this angle<i>,</i>

280
00:22:37,689 --> 00:22:39,850
That is fantastic<i>,</i>

281
00:22:46,732 --> 00:22:52,329
The scale of these things
is so much larger than I had imagined<i>,</i>

282
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:54,565
It's just amazing<i>,</i>

283
00:22:56,074 --> 00:23:00,568
We've got this huge,
huge carbonate structure<i>,</i>

284
00:23:00,645 --> 00:23:02,670
Unbelievable<i>,</i>

285
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:08,218
<i>(Jim on radio) Copy that.</i>
<i>Right rotator going up, rotator going up.</i>

286
00:23:11,156 --> 00:23:15,525
It's just the hot water just flowing up
and slowly forming stalactites<i>,</i>

287
00:23:15,594 --> 00:23:21,362
Upside-down stalactites are slowly
deposited, millennium after millennium<i>,</i>

288
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:25,098
<i>(Kevin)</i> So what's interesting
about these

289
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,071
is that you don't necessarily
need plate tectonics<i>,</i>

290
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:33,976
You need some means for the water
to react with the deep mantle rock<i>,</i>

291
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:37,344
And then you get
the serpentinization reaction

292
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:42,479
which produces the heat that drives
the formation of such systems<i>,</i>

293
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:44,021
It's absolutely phenomenal<i>,</i>

294
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:48,287
<i>(Jim on radio) Do you want to go ahead</i>
<i>and proceed to the summit? Over.</i>

295
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,419
<i>(Kevin)</i> Roger that<i>,</i>

296
00:24:12,918 --> 00:24:16,945
<i>- (Mike)</i> There's warm water up here<i>,</i>
<i>- (Kevin)</i> Yeah<i>,</i>

297
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:22,960
The vent fluid is just
coming right up out of here<i>,</i>

298
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:28,456
Wow<i>,</i> This is just amazing<i>,</i>

299
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:31,902
Our technology is just
at the level now

300
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:35,736
where we can safely explore
the depths of our own ocean<i>,</i>

301
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,332
<i>- (Mike)</i> Kinda friable<i>,</i>
- Yeah<i>,</i>

302
00:24:39,377 --> 00:24:41,140
OK<i>,</i>

303
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:44,707
Yeah! Look at that<i>,</i>

304
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:48,413
- We got a rock<i>,</i>
- Hey, we got a sample<i>,</i>

305
00:24:54,726 --> 00:24:56,990
<i>(Mike)</i> Rover One, Rover One,
this is Rover Two<i>,</i> Do you<i>,,,</i>

306
00:24:57,062 --> 00:24:59,155
- Oh, my goodness, look at that!
<i>- (Mike)</i> Oh, Christ!

307
00:24:59,231 --> 00:25:00,630
Holy cow<i>,</i>

308
00:25:00,699 --> 00:25:03,167
<i>- (Mike)</i> OK, stop it, stop it, stop it<i>,</i>
<i>- (Jim) Kevin. You seeing this?</i>

309
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:07,695
<i>(Kevin)</i> Look at that thing<i>,</i>
That is absolutely unreal<i>,</i>

310
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:09,637
<i>(Jim) See if you can</i>
<i>get your lights right on it.</i>

311
00:25:09,708 --> 00:25:11,733
<i>(Mike)</i> Roger that<i>,</i>

312
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:16,304
<i>(Kevin)</i> Oh, my goodness<i>,</i>
Look at that, it's just amazing<i>,</i>

313
00:25:17,782 --> 00:25:20,182
Oh, man, look at this thing<i>,</i>

314
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:23,415
Look at this thing<i>,</i>
This is incredible<i>,</i>

315
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:35,493
<i>(Kevin)</i> How can something
like that be alive?

316
00:25:35,567 --> 00:25:40,004
How does a creature like this work?
That is absolutely phenomenal<i>,</i>

317
00:25:41,606 --> 00:25:43,471
Beautiful<i>,</i>

318
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:46,637
Absolutely beautiful<i>,</i>

319
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:51,846
See the reticulation inside this thing?
Look at that<i>,</i>

320
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,317
That is amazing<i>,</i>

321
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:58,748
<i>(Jim)</i> I have no idea what that is<i>,</i>

322
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:02,650
- No<i>,</i>
- That's what I love about this stuff<i>,</i>

323
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:07,562
Every single dive, you're gonna see
something you've never seen before<i>,</i>

324
00:26:07,632 --> 00:26:12,831
And you might even see something
that nobody's ever seen before<i>,</i>

325
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:38,491
<i>(Jim)</i> Are you seeing this thing?
Look at this<i>,</i>

326
00:26:38,563 --> 00:26:42,124
This is, like,
the ugliest fish in the world<i>,</i>

327
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:53,642
Oh, he's got feet! Look, he's got feet<i>,</i>
He's got, like, little toe-socks<i>,</i>

328
00:26:58,583 --> 00:27:04,579
<i>(Jim) The thing about deep diving is you</i>
<i>always need to expect the unexpected.</i>

329
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:12,628
<i>(Kevin)</i> Oh, my God,
look at that squid<i>,</i>

330
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:14,892
Oh, it's massive<i>,</i>

331
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:18,198
Look, look, look<i>,</i>
Quick, look<i>,</i>

332
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:20,897
See it?

333
00:27:20,972 --> 00:27:22,872
Absolutely fantastic<i>,</i>

334
00:28:23,134 --> 00:28:25,932
Look at that fish<i>,</i>
You see that guy?

335
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:55,096
All right, we got us a Dumbo<i>,</i>
Been hoping for this for a while<i>,</i>

336
00:28:59,537 --> 00:29:04,338
What a beautiful animal<i>,</i>
What a beautiful animal<i>,</i> Look at that<i>,</i>

337
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,400
Like a dancer<i>,</i>

338
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,545
What an amazing creature<i>,</i>

339
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:34,003
God, you could watch this guy all day<i>,</i>

340
00:29:34,072 --> 00:29:37,633
Almost looks like
he's glowing from within<i>,</i>

00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:15,802
<i>(Mike)</i> It's intermittent, Jim<i>,</i>
Sometimes yes and sometimes no<i>,</i>

345
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,041
<i>(Jim)</i> Uh, roger, Mike<i>,</i>

346
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:24,111
We're seriously low on power
and will have to leave the bottom<i>,</i>

00:30:24,189 --> 00:30:26,987
I cannot get ahold of Vince<i>,</i>

348
00:30:27,058 --> 00:30:29,049
We must go up<i>,</i>

349
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,660
Genya<i>,</i> We must go up<i>,</i>

350
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:38,932
Oh, he's trying to say something,
about<i>,,,</i>

351
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:41,130
He's trying to say<i>,,,</i>
Look out the porthole<i>,</i>

00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,969
I can't see him<i>,</i>

353
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,975
Can you call surface?

354
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:47,637
He's saying, "Up and over"?
Might be<i>,</i>

355
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:52,547
We need you to contact the surface
that we are ascending<i>,</i>

356
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:01,523
<i>(Mike)</i> Can't read it<i>,</i> Zoom in<i>,</i>
Let's see if you can read the sign<i>,</i>

357
00:31:05,430 --> 00:31:09,560
<i>(Mike)</i> "Contact surface, must surface<i>,</i>"
Understood<i>,</i> We'll contact them right now<i>,</i>

- We got the goods<i>,</i> We definitely got it<i>,</i>

362
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:25,100
Ah, that thing is phenomenal<i>,</i>
How you doing?

363
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:30,803
- What did you see down there?
- Oh, it was just incredible<i>,</i> Just incredible<i>,</i>

364
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:34,613
There was a huge, um<i>,,,</i>
Was it a jellyfish?

365
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:38,687
Some type of gelatinous<i>,,,</i>

366
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:40,553
Massive<i>,</i> Like, a meter<i>,</i>

367
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:43,594
We think that it was feeding
off of the, uh,

368
00:32:43,661 --> 00:32:49,327
off the amphipods and the plankton
and the copepods that were next to<i>,,,</i>

- Hanging out at the lights?
- Hanging out at the light, yeah<i>,</i>

00:32:51,869 --> 00:32:54,337
- How's it work?
- Man, we don't know<i>,</i>

371
00:32:54,405 --> 00:32:57,067
- But it's there<i>,</i> So it's working somehow<i>,</i>
- Exactly<i>,</i>

372
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,599
- Life's pretty cool<i>,</i>
- Yeah, absolutely fantastic<i>,</i>

373
00:33:00,678 --> 00:33:03,078
- Welcome back, Kevin<i>,</i>
- Thanks<i>,</i>

374
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,710
- Team Rover<i>,</i>
- Go team Rover!

375
00:33:06,784 --> 00:33:08,775
<i>(cheering)</i>

376
00:33:13,024 --> 00:33:15,857
<i>My name is Maya Tolstoy,</i>
<i>and I'm a marine seismologist</i>

377
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:19,192
<i>at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory.</i>

378
00:33:20,131 --> 00:33:22,292
<i>I study underwater volcanoes,</i>

379
00:33:22,367 --> 00:33:26,736
<i>and particularly I study the earthquakes</i>
<i>that these volcanoes make.</i>

380
00:33:26,804 --> 00:33:30,069
<i>And I'm trying to understand</i>
<i>how the Earth is made,</i>

381
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:33,577
<i>how the surface of</i>
<i>the planet is formed.</i>

382
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:39,178
<i>I'm going to be deploying</i>
<i>ocean-bottom seismometers.</i>

383
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,775
<i>Those are instruments</i>
<i>that listen to earthquakes</i>

384
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:45,050
<i>and other noises on the ocean floor.</i>

385
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:52,160
<i>In the ocean,</i>
<i>the light only goes so far.</i>

386
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:56,757
<i>And so sound allows you</i>
<i>to basically see the bottom of the ocean,</i>

387
00:33:56,834 --> 00:34:03,000
<i>and to see into the ocean crust, the way</i>
<i>that light lets you see on the surface.</i>

388
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:13,141
<i>We put the instruments over the side of</i>
<i>the ship. They drop, they gather the data.</i>

389
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:18,211
<i>Normally, I don't have to dive</i>
<i>in order to do my job.</i>

390
00:34:19,223 --> 00:34:22,158
<i>So it was very exciting</i>
<i>to finally see the environment</i>

391
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:24,854
<i>that I've been working on</i>
<i>for over a decade.</i>

392

<i>(Maya)</i> MIR two, copy<i>,</i>

393
00:34:26,497 --> 00:34:29,660
<i>(man on radio) We have a visual on you.</i>
<i>We are inbound.</i>

00:34:29,734 --> 00:34:32,396
Roger that<i>,</i>

395
00:34:33,171 --> 00:34:36,265
<i>- (Kevin)</i> Can you see them?
<i>- (Maya)</i> Yeah<i>,</i> It's out my window<i>,</i>

396
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:38,433
It looks like a spaceship<i>,</i>

397
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:44,171
Wow<i>,</i>

398
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:48,082
That's incredible<i>,</i>
That's like another planet<i>,</i>

399
00:34:52,457 --> 00:34:55,119
<i>(Maya) It's such</i>
<i>an incredible world down there,</i>

400
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:57,684
<i>and it's so important</i>
<i>to the formation of our planet.</i>

401
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:01,323
<i>It's where two thirds</i>
<i>of the surface of our world was created,</i>

402
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:04,368
<i>and we still know so little about it.</i>

403
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:07,965
Do you see how
they're all shiny and glassy?

404
00:35:08,039 --> 00:35:11,634
<i>- (Kevin)</i> Oh, yeah<i>,</i> Look at that<i>,</i>
- That shows that it cooled superquickly<i>,</i>

405
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:16,203
That's just, like, it really turns
to glass, basically<i>,</i> To obsidian, it's called<i>,</i>

406
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,372
<i>(Kevin)</i> Look at that<i>,</i>

407
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,939
<i>(Maya)</i> And you see how there's
hardly any sediment on it?

408
00:35:20,017 --> 00:35:25,182
That's when it's really fresh<i>,</i>
This is brand-new crust we're looking at<i>,</i>

409
00:35:25,256 --> 00:35:26,188
<i>(Kevin)</i> Wow<i>,</i>

410
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:30,887
Now, can you just imagine
being down here when this stuff erupts?

411
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:34,398
Molten rock oozing out
and hitting the freezing cold water<i>,</i>

412
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:37,161
I just can't imagine it<i>,</i>
It must have been insane<i>,</i>

413
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:39,499
<i>(Kevin)</i> Must look pretty cool<i>,</i>

414
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:43,028
For the few seconds before you die<i>,</i>

415
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:53,916
<i>(Maya) I miss my son.</i>

416
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:56,180
<i>He's five months old.</i>

417
00:35:56,254 --> 00:36:00,486
<i>It was such a hard decision</i>
<i>to make to come out here.</i>

418
00:36:00,558 --> 00:36:04,995
<i>But I think it's important to study</i>
<i>one of the most remarkable phenomenon</i>

419
00:36:05,062 --> 00:36:08,031
<i>we've ever discovered</i>
<i>in the oceans.</i>

420
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:15,529
MIR Two, just keep going
upslope on this heading<i>,</i>

421
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:19,133
The chimneys should be
at the top of this sulfide mound<i>,</i> Over<i>,</i>

422
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:21,976
Roger that<i>,</i>

423
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:35,719
<i>(Maya)</i> Wow<i>,</i>

424
00:36:35,793 --> 00:36:37,784
There it is<i>,</i>

425
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:00,339
<i>(Maya) All around our world,</i>

426
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:03,876
<i>running down the middle of the oceans</i>
<i>like seams on a baseball,</i>

427
00:37:03,955 --> 00:37:07,015
<i>are these cracks,</i>
<i>these spreading centers,</i>

428
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:11,721
<i>where the crust of the planet</i>
<i>is literally ripping apart.</i>

429
00:37:12,964 --> 00:37:15,455
<i>Up above,</i>
<i>the sea looks normal.</i>

430
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:22,464
<i>But two miles down,</i>
<i>it's a violent landscape</i>

431
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:27,443
<i>where fresh lava flows</i>
<i>out of the crack and freezes into rock.</i>

432
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:34,074
<i>When the sea water seeps down to the</i>
<i>molten rock just beneath the new crust,</i>

433
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:37,712
<i>it gets superheated,</i>
<i>far hotter than boiling.</i>

434
00:37:37,788 --> 00:37:41,588
<i>But it can't boil, because of the intense</i>
<i>pressure at the bottom of the ocean.</i>

435
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:44,958
<i>So it comes roaring up</i>
<i>out of the sea floor.</i>

436
00:37:45,963 --> 00:37:50,093
<i>When the superheated water hits the</i>
<i>freezing ocean, minerals condense out,</i>

437
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:54,126
<i>forming the chimneys,</i>
<i>and creating the black smoke.</i>

438
00:38:22,533 --> 00:38:24,831
<i>When you see black smoke,</i>
<i>what you're really seeing</i>

439
00:38:24,902 --> 00:38:27,871
<i>is a blowtorch of</i>
<i>superheated water.</i>

440
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:34,973
Uh, we're getting in position
to get a water sample

441
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:37,344
from the top
of one of these structures<i>,</i> Over<i>,</i>

442
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:40,441
<i>(Jim on radio) Yeah, roger that.</i>
<i>That's good.</i>

443
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:49,024
OK, let's get in as close as we can
on this chimney, Genya<i>,</i>

444
00:38:49,093 --> 00:38:53,154
<i>(Maya) These chimneys</i>
<i>reach 750 degrees Fahrenheit,</i>

445
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:57,394
<i>and that's hot enough to melt</i>
<i>the windows of your submersible.</i>

446
00:38:57,468 --> 00:38:59,698
<i>That's a bad thing.</i>

447
00:38:59,770 --> 00:39:04,571
<i>Mental note: Don't melt</i>
<i>the windows of the submersible.</i>

448
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,802
<i>(Maya)</i> Guys, we're getting really close
to this black smoker here<i>,</i>

449
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:12,178
- Close enough?
- I think this is maybe a little too close<i>,</i>

450
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:16,049
Uh, well, we're starting
to get into the plume<i>,</i>

451
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:18,713
<i>(Maya)</i> Right underneath the sub<i>,</i>

452
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,416
<i>(Jim) Genya, move back.</i>
<i>You better move back.</i>

453
00:39:20,491 --> 00:39:23,585
<i>(Genya)</i> OK<i>,</i> I start to move back<i>,</i>

454
00:39:30,034 --> 00:39:34,596
<i>(Mike on radio) That's normal.</i>
<i>We usually drive right in 'em like that.</i>

455
00:39:34,672 --> 00:39:39,041
We were right on top of it<i>,</i>
That was a little freaky<i>,</i>

456
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:50,276
That's pretty cool, Kevin<i>,</i>

457
00:39:50,354 --> 00:39:55,018
<i>(Dijanna) The geology's fascinating.</i>
<i>But it's not why I came out here.</i>

458
00:39:57,094 --> 00:40:00,928
<i>(Dijanna) Keldysh, Keldysh,</i> MIR Two<i>,</i>
We are on the bottom<i>,</i>

459
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:04,092
Depth 3526 meters<i>,</i>

460
00:40:04,168 --> 00:40:08,161
And we are at the top
of the Moose structure<i>,</i> Over<i>,</i>

461
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:15,209
<i>(Dijanna) These sites were</i>
<i>first visited 25 years ago by geologists.</i>

462
00:40:15,279 --> 00:40:18,077
<i>And they weren't looking for life.</i>

463
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:22,117
<i>But it wasn't until</i>
<i>they got into a submersible</i>

464
00:40:22,186 --> 00:40:27,123
<i>and went down to the bottom</i>
<i>to see with their own eyes...</i>

465
00:40:27,191 --> 00:40:33,061
<i>It was like, "Oh, my God.</i>
<i>There's life down here, and it's beautiful. "</i>

466
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:35,360
<i>It's an entire ecosystem.</i>

467
00:40:38,869 --> 00:40:40,803
Wow<i>,</i> That's awesome<i>,</i>

468
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:48,233
<i>(Dijanna on radio) Copy that. That's what</i>
<i>we're imaging right now. Over.</i>

469
00:40:48,946 --> 00:40:54,942
<i>- (Dijanna)</i> Look at all that hot water<i>,</i>
<i>- (Jim)</i> They're right in the flow<i>,</i>

470
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:01,084
Oh, man<i>,</i> Check this out<i>,</i>

471
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:07,063
It's like liquid fire,
and these guys are dancing right next to it<i>,</i>

472
00:41:07,131 --> 00:41:10,498
They are really tickling
the dragon's tail<i>,</i>

473
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,932
<i>(Dijanna) The science community</i>
<i>was stunned.</i>

474
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:19,772
<i>How could these animals</i>
<i>be living in these toxic chemicals,</i>

475
00:41:19,844 --> 00:41:23,336
<i>at these pressures,</i>
<i>around extremes of temperature</i>

476
00:41:23,414 --> 00:41:27,282
<i>from freezing to beyond boiling</i>
<i>in just a few inches?</i>

477
00:41:30,054 --> 00:41:35,048
<i>How could there be a whole ecosystem</i>
<i>living without sunlight?</i>

478
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:40,888
<i>And not just living,</i>
<i>but thriving!</i>

479
00:41:44,568 --> 00:41:46,695
<i>(Jim)</i> Unbelievable<i>,</i>

480
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:51,605
This is the most insane
amount of biomass I ever saw in my life<i>,</i>

481
00:41:51,675 --> 00:41:53,233
<i>(Dijanna)</i> Wow<i>,</i>

482
00:41:53,310 --> 00:41:55,801
- Holy pancakes, Batman<i>,</i>
<i>- (Jim laughs)</i>

483
00:42:03,888 --> 00:42:08,985
And they're right there in the flow,
just enjoying the hydrothermal fluid<i>,</i>

484
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:12,324
<i>(Jim)</i> Oh, look at 'em swarming<i>,</i>
They love it in the smoke<i>,</i>

485
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:14,387
<i>(Dijanna)</i> Oh, yeah<i>,</i>

486
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:19,427
<i>(Dijanna) The vents</i>
<i>were providing the energy for life.</i>

487
00:42:19,503 --> 00:42:22,301
<i>It was coming from chemicals</i>
<i>dissolved in the water,</i>

488
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:25,501
<i>coming from inside the Earth itself.</i>

489
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:29,342
<i>Not photosynthesis,</i>
<i>but chemosynthesis.</i>

490
00:42:32,616 --> 00:42:37,610
<i>It was a whole new basis for life,</i>
<i>one that didn't need the sun,</i>

491
00:42:37,688 --> 00:42:40,748
<i>only water and heat.</i>

492
00:42:41,926 --> 00:42:45,123
<i>(Jim)</i> That party's been going on down
there in the dark for the last billion years,

493
00:42:45,195 --> 00:42:47,356
and it's gonna be going on
for the next billion years<i>,</i>

494
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:50,423
They're just doing their thing,
it's got nothing to do with us,

495
00:42:50,501 --> 00:42:56,497
the sun could go out tomorrow and they
wouldn't know and they wouldn't care<i>,</i>

496
00:42:57,541 --> 00:43:01,136
<i>(Kevin) Exploring and discovering</i>
<i>ecosystems like this,</i>

497
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:06,205
<i>which may not depend</i>
<i>on energy from the sun,</i>

498
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:09,013
<i>opens up all sorts</i>
<i>of interesting possibilities</i>

499
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:12,647
<i>when we think about</i>
<i>the search for life elsewhere.</i>

500
00:43:15,225 --> 00:43:20,094
<i>Wherever we've found liquid water</i>
<i>on planet Earth, we've found life.</i>

501
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:22,155
<i>That's pretty profound.</i>

502
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:30,132
<i>If we find liquid water elsewhere in</i>
<i>the solar system, are we gonna find life?</i>

503
00:43:30,207 --> 00:43:33,472
<i>We won't know</i>
<i>unless we start searching.</i>

504
00:43:42,353 --> 00:43:47,086
<i>In fact, NASA is planning a mission</i>
<i>called the Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter.</i>

505
00:43:47,157 --> 00:43:49,057
<i>AKA JIMO.</i>

506
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,617
<i>At 120 feet long</i>
<i>it's gonna be several times longer</i>

507
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:53,890
<i>than any planetary probe</i>
<i>ever launched,</i>

508
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:59,664
<i>and its nuclear reactor will power</i>
<i>ion engines and a big science radar.</i>

509
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:09,509
<i>The main goal of JIMO</i>
<i>will be to use that radar</i>

510
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:13,778
<i>to look down through the ice</i>
<i>of Jupiter's three largest moons.</i>

511
00:44:13,851 --> 00:44:17,787
<i>First, it will study Callisto,</i>
<i>and then it'll move to Ganymede.</i>

512
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:22,690
<i>And these are bizarre moons,</i>
<i>the largest of Jupiter's 61 known moons.</i>

513
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,252
<i>Callisto and Ganymede</i>
<i>both have crusts of ancient ice and rock</i>

514
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:29,993
<i>that may hide oceans</i>
<i>miles below the surface.</i>

515
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:37,666
<i>Further in is Io,</i>
<i>which is a moon of fire, not ice.</i>

516
00:44:40,778 --> 00:44:45,078
<i>Io's eccentric orbit causes it</i>
<i>to deform as it circles Jupiter.</i>

517
00:44:45,149 --> 00:44:48,812
<i>This intense tidal pumping</i>
<i>pulls at the moon like taffy,</i>

518
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:52,049
<i>generating friction at the core</i>
<i>which then becomes heat,</i>

519
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:57,526
<i>and this heat drives the solar system's</i>
<i>largest active volcanoes.</i>

520
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:02,891
<i>There are constant eruptions,</i>
<i>rivers of lava,</i>

521
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:07,801
<i>and volcanic plumes shooting</i>
<i>hundreds of miles into space.</i>

522
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:24,817
<i>But the gem of the Jovian system, at least</i>
<i>as far as the search for life is concerned,</i>

523
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:26,412
<i>is Europa.</i>

524
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:31,484
<i>It's here where fire and ice</i>
<i>come together in perfect harmony.</i>

525
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:35,458
<i>The scientific community</i>
<i>is relatively certain</i>

526
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:41,266
<i>that beneath the icy, chaotic shell of</i>
<i>Europa, there exists a liquid water ocean,</i>

527
00:45:41,338 --> 00:45:46,366
<i>with twice the volume</i>
<i>of all the Earth's oceans combined.</i>

528
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:51,881
<i>So tidal heating is working here too,</i>
<i>keeping that water from freezing.</i>

529
00:45:51,949 --> 00:45:55,407
<i>And possibly providing</i>
<i>energy for life.</i>

530
00:45:55,486 --> 00:46:01,186
<i>The same kind of life that we're finding</i>
<i>at the deep vents here on Earth.</i>

531
00:46:09,967 --> 00:46:13,596
<i>(Jim)</i> You see all that out there,
all that yellow and white and orange?

532
00:46:13,670 --> 00:46:16,969
That's just a huge
colony of microbes<i>,</i>

533
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:22,970
This is just acres and acres
of this bacterial mass<i>,</i>

534
00:46:23,046 --> 00:46:27,107
Look at that<i>,</i> This could be like
a little glimpse back in time<i>,</i>

535
00:46:27,184 --> 00:46:30,620
<i>(Jim)</i> Yeah, couple of billion years ago<i>,</i>

536
00:46:30,687 --> 00:46:33,383
<i>(Kevin) Hydrothermal vents</i>
<i>have been on planet Earth</i>

537
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,652
<i>since the oceans were formed.</i>

538
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:42,026
<i>It may have been sites like these</i>
<i>around which life itself began.</i>

539
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:46,129
<i>(Kevin)</i> If we can just sort of
scoop up the top area of that,

540
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:49,036
maybe a little bit of
the sediment below<i>,</i>

541
00:46:49,106 --> 00:46:50,664
Excellent<i>,</i>

542
00:46:50,741 --> 00:46:53,107
Nice sample<i>,</i>

543
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:58,706
You can see all the stringy
little filaments that make up the mat<i>,</i>

544
00:46:59,216 --> 00:47:03,448
<i>(Kevin) Extremophiles are simply</i>
<i>life forms that thrive in the extremes</i>

545
00:47:03,520 --> 00:47:07,684
<i>of temperature and pressure</i>
<i>and radiation,</i>

546
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:10,659
<i>environments that to us are deadly.</i>

547
00:47:12,596 --> 00:47:18,694
<i>These microbes go far beyond anything</i>
<i>which our imagination could conceive of</i>

548
00:47:18,769 --> 00:47:23,399
<i>back when we first started studying</i>
<i>where we might find life.</i>

549
00:47:23,473 --> 00:47:26,874
Now, if we find anything on Europa,
it's probably gonna look just like this<i>,</i>
