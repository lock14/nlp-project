1
00:00:35,466 --> 00:00:36,759
The ancient book say...

2
00:00:36,793 --> 00:00:38,393
That in the beginning...

3
00:00:38,627 --> 00:00:40,493
There was no light in our world.

4
00:00:41,366 --> 00:00:43,237
It took a super strong man...

5
00:00:43,262 --> 00:00:46,338
To bring the sun down
to our little planet.

6
00:00:49,515 --> 00:00:50,948
The guardian of the sun...

7
00:00:50,972 --> 00:00:54,270
Regulates the seasons, looks
after land and stuff like that.

8
00:00:55,674 --> 00:00:56,814
As for the moon...

9
00:00:56,975 --> 00:00:59,015
It was brought over from
the world of dreams...

10
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:00,700
By the first guardian of the moon.

11
00:01:03,042 --> 00:01:04,025
Actually,

12
00:01:04,281 --> 00:01:06,659
he is someone who brought
dreams into our world as well.

13
00:01:09,147 --> 00:01:10,039
And that's...

14
00:01:10,063 --> 00:01:11,698
How the balance was created...

15
00:01:11,724 --> 00:01:13,623
Between day and night.

16
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:53,045
Sohone!

17
00:01:55,868 --> 00:01:56,415
Hye, girls.

18
00:01:58,401 --> 00:01:59,537
How you doin'?

19
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:03,897
Tomorrow is the big day.

20
00:02:04,286 --> 00:02:07,004
Guess who is about to become the
next "guardian of the sun".

21
00:02:07,603 --> 00:02:09,514
Sohone!

22
00:02:10,221 --> 00:02:11,066
Damn right.

23
00:02:28,632 --> 00:02:29,132
Glim!

24
00:02:29,413 --> 00:02:32,582
I know what you're upto and I
forbid you to even think about it.

25
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:34,701
You are not going to that ridiculous show.

26
00:02:34,727 --> 00:02:35,396
If you say, dad.

27
00:02:35,396 --> 00:02:37,617
It's not your business and
it was too dangerous.

28
00:02:38,128 --> 00:02:39,391
I told you a million times,

29
00:02:39,596 --> 00:02:40,526
but, no no no no no!

30
00:02:40,862 --> 00:02:42,622
Why should you listen
to an old candle, han.

31
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:43,998
Well, young lady

32
00:02:44,024 --> 00:02:46,252
because this old candle knows better.

33
00:02:46,769 --> 00:02:48,679
You know you can't go out in the sun.

34
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:52,022
Last time you snucked out your
arms melted down your feet...

35
00:02:52,048 --> 00:02:52,218
Yep!

36
00:02:52,242 --> 00:02:54,954
I'm not good to spend my
life resculpturing you.

37
00:02:54,979 --> 00:02:55,687
Of course!

38
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:57,211
You want to end up like your mother.

39
00:02:57,537 --> 00:02:59,668
She also wanted to see the world.

40
00:03:00,498 --> 00:03:03,389
Oh, Ursula, my poor precious darling!

41
00:03:03,882 --> 00:03:07,611
Why did you have to go out for big carrots in
a terrible heat flame at 3 in the afternoon.

42
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:10,086
I told you the fields weren't safe.

43
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,609
Nightfall!

44
00:03:12,812 --> 00:03:13,725
Quick! Get to bed

45
00:03:13,751 --> 00:03:15,311
and find something else to dream about.

46
00:03:15,538 --> 00:03:17,379
If I catch you trying to go tomorrow...

47
00:03:17,381 --> 00:03:18,901
You are gonna be in big trouble...

48
00:03:18,925 --> 00:03:19,634
Young lady.

49
00:03:19,804 --> 00:03:23,435
You making me boil and the
melting's giving me wrinkles

50
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,929
end of a conver...

51
00:03:24,954 --> 00:03:26,146
Sa...

52
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:26,682
Tion.

53
00:04:10,713 --> 00:04:12,408
My, friends.

54
00:04:13,385 --> 00:04:14,736
As you all know

55
00:04:15,314 --> 00:04:16,949
tomorrow I shall be named...

56
00:04:17,028 --> 00:04:19,427
The new "guardians of the moon".

57
00:04:21,134 --> 00:04:23,079
It will be a historic moment...

58
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:25,449
For all, people

59
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:27,132
of the night.

60
00:04:39,452 --> 00:04:39,952
Miss me!

61
00:04:46,898 --> 00:04:48,077
You can catch me, come on.

62
00:04:51,685 --> 00:04:52,564
And I will be will...

63
00:05:02,362 --> 00:05:05,004
Mune can't you be responsible for once.

64
00:05:05,324 --> 00:05:07,105
You've embarrassed me in front of leeyoon.

65
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:11,812
I forbid you to go to
the ceremony tomorrow.

66
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:14,819
You can come out when you are
ready to make yourself useful.

67
00:05:22,293 --> 00:05:23,457
But I am useless.

68
00:06:12,367 --> 00:06:13,288
Ya!

69
00:06:13,461 --> 00:06:14,608
Today is the day.

70
00:06:15,062 --> 00:06:17,053
Everyone to the arena.

71
00:06:39,175 --> 00:06:41,463
Oh poor daddy, still frozen!

72
00:06:43,543 --> 00:06:45,384
This day is going to go
down in historic, dad.

73
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:46,379
I can't miss it.

74
00:06:47,308 --> 00:06:48,749
Don't worry, I'll stay in the shade.

75
00:06:49,028 --> 00:06:49,637
I promise.

76
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,129
Love you.

77
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:54,346
I'll be back for lunch.

78
00:07:19,112 --> 00:07:19,870
People of the day!

79
00:07:21,069 --> 00:07:22,269
Give you applause...

80
00:07:22,326 --> 00:07:23,266
For the mench...

81
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:24,600
The mighty...

82
00:07:25,252 --> 00:07:26,593
The legendary...

83
00:07:27,043 --> 00:07:28,649
Guardian of the sun.

84
00:07:28,682 --> 00:07:30,918
Master xolal.

85
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,336
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you...

86
00:07:45,326 --> 00:07:47,526
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!
Thank you! Thank you!

87
00:07:48,731 --> 00:07:50,023
Thank you! Thank you!

88
00:07:52,531 --> 00:07:54,757
Thank you my dear krrrack!

89
00:07:54,771 --> 00:07:57,471
You have the sweetest heart of stone.

90
00:07:59,754 --> 00:08:01,822
People of the day.

91
00:08:01,831 --> 00:08:04,391
I've been in charge of the sun's past...

92
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,981
For 350 years now.

93
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,199
It's time for me to step down.

94
00:08:11,331 --> 00:08:13,961
I call upon my disciple

95
00:08:14,184 --> 00:08:15,644
to come forward

96
00:08:20,038 --> 00:08:20,896
ya!

97
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:31,261
Ya!

98
00:08:35,404 --> 00:08:35,904
Sohone!

99
00:08:35,929 --> 00:08:36,278
Ya!

100
00:08:36,303 --> 00:08:37,322
Sohone!

101
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:46,961
As long as the sun shines brightly

102
00:08:47,335 --> 00:08:50,044
the moon will glow humbly.

103
00:08:52,581 --> 00:08:57,620
I am yule, the guardian of the moon.

104
00:08:58,152 --> 00:09:02,455
I call upon my disciple

105
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:05,428
to step forward

106
00:09:11,232 --> 00:09:12,946
oh, sun!

107
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:16,554
I present to you, my disciple

108
00:09:17,355 --> 00:09:19,682
he has a heart of fire.

109
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,541
And I believe him worthy of you.

110
00:09:29,815 --> 00:09:31,721
I acknowledge him!

111
00:09:46,645 --> 00:09:48,556
We're all gonna die!

112
00:09:49,951 --> 00:09:50,951
Help me.

113
00:09:58,546 --> 00:10:01,811
The sun recognizes its new guardian

114
00:10:01,836 --> 00:10:03,403
I name

115
00:10:05,543 --> 00:10:06,868
sohone!

116
00:10:06,869 --> 00:10:08,386
Yes, sohone!

117
00:10:14,445 --> 00:10:18,018
Thank you! Thank you! Hello darling!

118
00:10:22,164 --> 00:10:24,837
Sohone!

119
00:10:33,558 --> 00:10:34,286
Kukku!

120
00:10:36,065 --> 00:10:37,474
Oh, moon.

121
00:10:38,205 --> 00:10:42,712
I present to you my disciple...

122
00:10:42,924 --> 00:10:44,758
He has a heart...

123
00:10:44,798 --> 00:10:46,395
Oh goody!

124
00:10:46,421 --> 00:10:47,729
And I believe him...

125
00:10:48,421 --> 00:10:49,181
Of you.

126
00:10:49,602 --> 00:10:52,883
But, only one creature on the planet

127
00:10:52,886 --> 00:10:54,520
can be the judge of this.

128
00:10:56,948 --> 00:10:59,815
The purest creature of all.

129
00:11:02,022 --> 00:11:03,977
The moon...

130
00:11:03,979 --> 00:11:06,144
Recognizes...

131
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,971
What is this?

132
00:11:32,278 --> 00:11:34,476
Mune! Get out of there, right now!

133
00:11:35,407 --> 00:11:36,153
Mune!

134
00:11:38,017 --> 00:11:39,554
Who do you think you are.

135
00:11:39,567 --> 00:11:39,962
I...

136
00:11:39,972 --> 00:11:41,955
You are ruining my ceremony.

137
00:11:45,908 --> 00:11:47,225
Go!

138
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,618
Go!

139
00:11:48,643 --> 00:11:49,884
Get out of here!

140
00:11:51,943 --> 00:11:52,443
Stay!

141
00:11:52,806 --> 00:11:53,703
Stay still!

142
00:11:53,774 --> 00:11:57,022
What's your name, little creature?

143
00:11:57,023 --> 00:11:57,876
Mune!

144
00:11:57,894 --> 00:11:58,998
Well then

145
00:11:59,241 --> 00:12:00,467
mune!

146
00:12:00,481 --> 00:12:04,240
You are the new guardian of the moon.

147
00:12:05,802 --> 00:12:07,273
What! Him?

148
00:12:07,712 --> 00:12:10,721
But, you said this whole
ritual was a formality.

149
00:12:10,722 --> 00:12:11,559
Well,

150
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:14,934
the moon felt otherwise.

151
00:12:30,066 --> 00:12:33,405
There can be no day without night.

152
00:12:33,966 --> 00:12:37,432
The same goes for the guardians.

153
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:42,177
The harmony of the planet
now rests in your hands.

154
00:12:43,584 --> 00:12:45,971
Prove yourselves worthy.

155
00:12:53,721 --> 00:12:55,528
You double crossed leeyoon

156
00:12:55,528 --> 00:12:57,153
you little blue rat!

157
00:12:57,154 --> 00:12:58,784
But I never wanted this.

158
00:12:58,786 --> 00:13:02,381
The big one is as arrogant as you were.

159
00:13:02,407 --> 00:13:05,562
The small one is as naive as you were.

160
00:13:05,592 --> 00:13:09,426
It was an honor to serve
as guardian with you.

161
00:13:10,173 --> 00:13:11,817
Come here, old chap!

162
00:13:42,057 --> 00:13:42,979
Necross!

163
00:13:43,092 --> 00:13:44,697
Necross!

164
00:13:47,669 --> 00:13:49,323
Xolal's reign is over.

165
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:51,513
The old lizard is on his way out out.

166
00:13:51,726 --> 00:13:53,463
Spleen, get your butt over here, quick.

167
00:13:53,470 --> 00:13:55,049
Come on. Chill out, mox.

168
00:13:55,114 --> 00:13:57,674
All this negative energy stressing me out.

169
00:13:57,682 --> 00:13:58,562
What? You wanna fight.

170
00:13:58,586 --> 00:14:00,178
I will mess you up!

171
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:01,509
Silence!!!

172
00:14:05,466 --> 00:14:11,655
I have been burning with desire to hear
that delightful news for centuries!

173
00:14:11,692 --> 00:14:16,318
Now the time has come
to steal back the sun!

174
00:14:18,418 --> 00:14:20,115
The boss is on fire.

175
00:14:20,116 --> 00:14:23,626
We are gonna so chaos
and misery everywhere!

176
00:14:23,823 --> 00:14:24,956
Yepi.

177
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,168
My precious one's!!!!

178
00:14:30,253 --> 00:14:31,191
What are those?

179
00:14:31,193 --> 00:14:34,000
These are evil corruptors.

180
00:14:34,105 --> 00:14:38,107
They find darkness in
even the purest of souls.

181
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,082
Here! Here! Make me evil!

182
00:14:41,106 --> 00:14:42,352
Make me evil!

183
00:14:42,378 --> 00:14:43,572
Please...

184
00:14:43,923 --> 00:14:44,599
Well.

185
00:14:45,186 --> 00:14:46,210
Whatever!

186
00:14:46,235 --> 00:14:50,121
Soon, that the sun will be mine

187
00:14:56,873 --> 00:14:59,173
years of training.

188
00:14:59,393 --> 00:15:02,336
I was going to be the perfect guardian.

189
00:15:02,938 --> 00:15:04,207
Moon was meant for me,

190
00:15:04,514 --> 00:15:05,668
no one else.

191
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,517
Obviously, the moon was meant for you.

192
00:15:11,524 --> 00:15:13,177
Right, me!

193
00:15:13,472 --> 00:15:16,546
Precisely, no one else.

194
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,208
Certainly not that...

195
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,278
Ridiculous little blue rat.

196
00:15:20,899 --> 00:15:23,453
That thing, a guardian!

197
00:15:23,472 --> 00:15:25,580
Exactly, give me a break!

198
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:27,118
Clearly the old guardian's...

199
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:29,774
Made an absurd choice.

200
00:15:30,082 --> 00:15:32,255
Necross agrees with you.

201
00:15:32,269 --> 00:15:33,280
Necross?

202
00:15:33,322 --> 00:15:35,611
Mune stole your place.

203
00:15:35,636 --> 00:15:37,111
Really.

204
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,822
What does necross think
I should do about it?

205
00:15:40,836 --> 00:15:43,136
Take back whats rightfully yours.

206
00:15:43,706 --> 00:15:44,576
Meaning?

207
00:15:44,663 --> 00:15:46,057
The sun for him

208
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,037
the moon for you.

209
00:15:49,376 --> 00:15:50,330
Come on, leeyoon!

210
00:15:50,581 --> 00:15:53,403
You know you deserve the moon.

211
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,033
Ya!

212
00:15:56,998 --> 00:15:58,802
I do.

213
00:16:20,499 --> 00:16:21,783
Well, mune.

214
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:25,178
This is your home now.

215
00:16:30,577 --> 00:16:34,158
I felt the same way, the first time.

216
00:16:34,749 --> 00:16:35,965
Whats that for?

217
00:16:35,996 --> 00:16:39,499
Well, to steer the temple, of course.

218
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,702
And what's this?

219
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:13,868
You know where the moon
comes from, don't you.

220
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:14,873
No.

221
00:17:15,096 --> 00:17:17,634
It comes from the world of dream.

222
00:17:18,141 --> 00:17:21,465
The first guardian carved the moon...

223
00:17:21,470 --> 00:17:25,584
And brought it into our
world through this trap door.

224
00:17:25,593 --> 00:17:29,491
And now it's your turn to watch over it.

225
00:17:29,509 --> 00:17:31,391
But I don't know what I am supposed to do?

226
00:17:31,392 --> 00:17:35,582
The role of guardian of the
moon is extra complexity...

227
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:38,556
And all this made
this extremely careful.

228
00:17:38,576 --> 00:17:42,875
You should never put dire consequences.

229
00:17:42,876 --> 00:17:45,396
Goodbye!

230
00:17:52,807 --> 00:17:55,256
Look, I really think there's been a mistake

231
00:17:55,257 --> 00:17:57,949
I'm scared of the dark, the
stars, all look the same to me.

232
00:17:57,950 --> 00:17:59,969
I get dawn and dusk mixed up.

233
00:17:59,970 --> 00:18:02,574
I'm a terrible singer, so...

234
00:18:02,575 --> 00:18:03,848
Guardian of the moon!

235
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:06,682
Master yule?

236
00:18:09,345 --> 00:18:11,194
Master yule, are you okay?

237
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,166
It's...

238
00:18:50,909 --> 00:18:53,281
I got no words, it is just...

239
00:18:54,048 --> 00:18:55,587
It's just...

240
00:18:55,622 --> 00:18:56,431
Am I right?

241
00:18:57,153 --> 00:18:58,407
My bad.

242
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,536
Don't worry, I'm used to it.

243
00:19:01,586 --> 00:19:02,705
And yes, it's just...

244
00:19:03,997 --> 00:19:06,771
Man! This dude was cool.

245
00:19:07,244 --> 00:19:08,528
Can you imagine!

246
00:19:08,545 --> 00:19:12,064
That guy harpooned the sun and
brought it to our planet.

247
00:19:12,088 --> 00:19:13,931
So, let's get down to business.

248
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,327
Where are the harpoons, han?

249
00:19:15,328 --> 00:19:17,021
We hardly ever used them.

250
00:19:17,035 --> 00:19:20,188
Being guardian of the sun
has become more complex...

251
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:24,144
Since the discovery of astronomy,
astrophysics, quantum physics.

252
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:26,471
But harpooning is what I trained for.

253
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:31,092
Well, there are other skills that you
need to learn other than harpooning star.

254
00:19:31,104 --> 00:19:35,825
Season calibration, photosynthesis,
proper solstice management.

255
00:19:35,845 --> 00:19:39,086
You are paying tribute to master xolal.

256
00:19:39,449 --> 00:19:43,994
Like all his predecessors, he has
transformed into a majestic statue.

257
00:19:45,759 --> 00:19:49,785
It is an honor serving you. Master xolal.

258
00:19:50,929 --> 00:19:53,474
And now it's time for fearless guardians...

259
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,291
To embark upon their thrilling
cosmic adventures and...

260
00:19:59,595 --> 00:20:00,423
Hello.

261
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,512
Hey! Come back here!

262
00:20:05,832 --> 00:20:06,550
No.

263
00:20:07,354 --> 00:20:08,098
Glim!

264
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:09,513
Where are the kill cupboards?

265
00:20:11,832 --> 00:20:13,568
Same place as usual, dad!

266
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:26,630
I am guardian...

267
00:20:26,648 --> 00:20:28,561
Of the moooon!

268
00:20:43,695 --> 00:20:46,536
I'm pretty sure this thing can go faster.

269
00:20:52,028 --> 00:20:52,528
No!

270
00:20:52,579 --> 00:20:54,808
No! No! No! No! No! No!

271
00:20:57,105 --> 00:20:58,171
Wrong note.

272
00:21:02,632 --> 00:21:04,818
This, this chord?

273
00:21:04,844 --> 00:21:05,479
Maybe...

274
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,829
No! No! No! No! No! No!

275
00:21:21,008 --> 00:21:22,567
Give me that, this chord!

276
00:21:22,592 --> 00:21:23,330
No!

277
00:21:23,355 --> 00:21:24,633
Or this one!

278
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,376
Hello, my fine feathered friend.

279
00:21:52,063 --> 00:21:55,083
Would you like to rest on my broad
and perfectly tend shoulder.

280
00:21:57,395 --> 00:21:58,536
Master sohone!

281
00:21:58,546 --> 00:22:01,288
This much heat could damage the crops.

282
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,944
It's time to raise the sun.

283
00:22:02,971 --> 00:22:05,824
Listen krrrack! Times are changing.

284
00:22:05,826 --> 00:22:08,288
People want the sun that shines you around.

285
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:09,713
Shines like me.

286
00:22:13,606 --> 00:22:15,318
What the heck is he doing there?

287
00:22:21,147 --> 00:22:21,988
Stop!

288
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:24,182
Stop!

289
00:22:24,826 --> 00:22:27,500
Stop, you are wrecking everything.

290
00:22:31,738 --> 00:22:33,802
Sorry!

291
00:22:40,619 --> 00:22:42,200
What's mune doing with the night?

292
00:22:48,186 --> 00:22:49,277
Please, stop!

293
00:22:58,359 --> 00:22:59,412
This is a nightmare.

294
00:23:12,013 --> 00:23:12,753
Night time?

295
00:23:13,386 --> 00:23:14,086
At this hour?

296
00:23:25,678 --> 00:23:26,882
The temple's gone off course.

297
00:23:28,267 --> 00:23:29,894
Its latitude is all wrong.

298
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:35,089
Don't worry, everything is under control.

299
00:23:46,776 --> 00:23:47,800
Where are you going?

300
00:23:48,339 --> 00:23:48,964
Stay here!

301
00:24:09,661 --> 00:24:12,150
Nooooooo!

302
00:24:30,182 --> 00:24:31,584
Oh, man.

303
00:24:35,868 --> 00:24:38,439
That little fuz ball is messing
up my first day on the job.

304
00:24:40,076 --> 00:24:43,203
I have come to pay my
respects to an old friend.

305
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:45,626
You have my "congratulations".

306
00:24:46,449 --> 00:24:47,471
Oh, leeyoon!

307
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,651
I'm about sorry what happened to you.

308
00:24:49,653 --> 00:24:52,731
But, as you can see I have got a
situation with the night here and...

309
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:53,932
Yes, I can see that.

310
00:24:54,403 --> 00:24:57,295
Yule made a terrible mistake
choosing that fraud.

311
00:24:57,319 --> 00:25:00,315
Lucky for us, I have got day under control.

312
00:25:00,339 --> 00:25:06,289
Mune's not only hurting the night, sohone.
He is threatening the harmony of our planet.

313
00:25:06,315 --> 00:25:11,851
You will have to deal the
consequences of his failures.

314
00:25:11,865 --> 00:25:13,722
That is so not cool!

315
00:25:13,723 --> 00:25:15,903
You must set things right.

316
00:25:16,493 --> 00:25:19,339
You and me... as guardians.

317
00:25:26,327 --> 00:25:28,421
Master sohone, where are you going?

318
00:25:28,445 --> 00:25:29,897
To get rid of that poser.

319
00:25:30,573 --> 00:25:32,748
I am not gonna let him
jeopardize my career.

320
00:25:33,547 --> 00:25:35,015
But you can't leave the temple

321
00:25:35,016 --> 00:25:36,741
its your duty as a guardian to

322
00:25:36,744 --> 00:25:37,699
to do what?

323
00:25:38,153 --> 00:25:40,314
Have you seen the size of this thing!
Or you worried?

324
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:42,511
Someone's gonna steal it by guard!

325
00:25:54,316 --> 00:25:54,973
Oh no!

326
00:25:56,044 --> 00:25:57,322
The moon is drifting.

327
00:26:15,446 --> 00:26:16,589
I have an idea.

328
00:27:20,054 --> 00:27:22,942
I don't think I have a
back bone in my body.

329
00:27:23,213 --> 00:27:25,884
Well, I don't have any
bones in my body, really.

330
00:27:26,161 --> 00:27:29,773
But, I just feel like I am a lousy daemon.

331
00:27:29,782 --> 00:27:31,511
I'm bad and...

332
00:27:31,518 --> 00:27:34,596
Hush!

333
00:27:35,744 --> 00:27:37,316
I think I'm doomed.

334
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:41,065
It's just... I love nature, you know.

335
00:27:55,769 --> 00:27:58,628
Well, nature doesn't love you back.
Get used to it.

336
00:27:58,653 --> 00:28:00,644
Now, let's bust this thing.

337
00:28:10,597 --> 00:28:12,162
What's that fool doing?

338
00:28:12,337 --> 00:28:14,824
Stay here, let me handle this.

339
00:28:15,505 --> 00:28:16,518
Come on, take it.

340
00:28:16,527 --> 00:28:19,067
The moon's fine. Just
put it back in the sky.

341
00:28:19,093 --> 00:28:20,653
And let's forget about the whole thing.

342
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:23,740
Come on! Maybe no one noticed.

343
00:28:23,765 --> 00:28:25,121
It will be our little secret.

344
00:28:30,990 --> 00:28:33,141
With this wind velocity and
this pressure gradient,

345
00:28:33,165 --> 00:28:35,462
the moon should hit the
lower troposphere and...

346
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,182
What was that?

347
00:28:45,698 --> 00:28:47,844
You come on!!

348
00:28:48,117 --> 00:28:49,961
What are you doing over there?!

349
00:28:50,156 --> 00:28:52,230
I'm carrying this entire thing.

350
00:28:53,486 --> 00:28:57,413
Working pretty hard, back here.
Getting sweaty.

351
00:29:05,641 --> 00:29:06,407
The sun!

352
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:07,491
No!

353
00:29:14,088 --> 00:29:16,589
And, where do you think!!
You are you going?

354
00:29:16,596 --> 00:29:18,192
Two little devils are stealing the sun.

355
00:29:18,215 --> 00:29:20,499
Its none of your business, let
the guardians handle this.

356
00:29:20,523 --> 00:29:21,611
But I need to tell them

357
00:29:21,612 --> 00:29:23,416
you need do as I say.

358
00:29:25,155 --> 00:29:25,655
Dad!

359
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:27,244
Give me back my hand.

360
00:29:29,384 --> 00:29:30,008
Dad!

361
00:29:31,650 --> 00:29:34,596
Sweetheart. You're just too fragile.

362
00:29:34,631 --> 00:29:37,528
All I want is to protect you from danger.

363
00:29:39,854 --> 00:29:41,730
You have to trust me, daddy.

364
00:29:45,372 --> 00:29:47,411
Glim, get back here.

365
00:29:48,941 --> 00:29:52,115
You are made of the same
wax as your mother.

366
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,990
Just like all your night friends.

367
00:29:54,015 --> 00:29:56,686
Creeping and crawling and
when you come into the light

368
00:29:56,699 --> 00:29:57,621
its a disaster.

369
00:29:57,645 --> 00:29:58,573
Its not my fault.

370
00:29:58,597 --> 00:29:59,944
Its a responsibility.

371
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:02,045
Its an honor to be a guardian.

372
00:30:02,112 --> 00:30:03,807
Its an honor I never wanted.

373
00:30:03,832 --> 00:30:04,339
Sohone!

374
00:30:04,365 --> 00:30:05,279
A girl?

375
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:06,013
Sohone!

376
00:30:06,821 --> 00:30:07,765
Ladies first.

377
00:30:07,892 --> 00:30:09,652
I'll will finish with you later.

378
00:30:18,634 --> 00:30:20,327
A fan.

379
00:30:20,353 --> 00:30:22,971
You came here to see your
hero in action, ay doll?

380
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,275
The sun!

381
00:30:28,299 --> 00:30:29,679
Somebody stole the sun!

382
00:30:30,535 --> 00:30:32,086
What?!

383
00:30:33,447 --> 00:30:35,010
I'll be right back.

384
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:58,323
No! No! No! No! No! No!
This can't be happening!

385
00:30:58,347 --> 00:31:00,076
It can't be!

386
00:31:00,101 --> 00:31:01,228
The sun!

387
00:31:05,124 --> 00:31:06,861
This is my fault.

388
00:31:11,798 --> 00:31:12,968
Night?

389
00:31:12,992 --> 00:31:14,951
At this time of day?

390
00:31:14,976 --> 00:31:15,976
That's weird!

391
00:31:17,291 --> 00:31:19,213
It probably just an eclipse!

392
00:31:20,682 --> 00:31:21,849
Well! Well!

393
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,857
You are mine once again!

394
00:31:25,894 --> 00:31:28,542
For years I've been watching you.

395
00:31:28,567 --> 00:31:31,488
I spread your light to run the planet.

396
00:31:31,512 --> 00:31:33,536
I spread life.

397
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,800
Still they took you back.

398
00:31:35,826 --> 00:31:38,394
The took your light away from me.

399
00:31:38,420 --> 00:31:41,177
And then plunged me into darkness.

400
00:31:42,171 --> 00:31:43,171
Fine...

401
00:31:43,429 --> 00:31:44,642
Then..

402
00:31:49,394 --> 00:31:52,055
Bring on darkness!

403
00:31:52,701 --> 00:31:53,894
Oh ya!

404
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:56,273
Have you seen how slap happy the boss is?

405
00:31:56,298 --> 00:32:00,147
Nothing like a little chaos and
destruction to make him smile.

406
00:32:03,481 --> 00:32:06,076
Put the sun somewhere safe!

407
00:32:06,102 --> 00:32:09,003
Where I can watch its heart grow cold.

408
00:32:09,028 --> 00:32:10,228
And die

409
00:32:11,215 --> 00:32:12,217
you are an idiot.

410
00:32:12,241 --> 00:32:13,906
But its not my fault, I...

411
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:14,352
No!

412
00:32:14,376 --> 00:32:16,376
That wasn't you riding the
temple of the moon like

413
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:17,500
a wild goroon!

414
00:32:17,525 --> 00:32:18,920
The temple of the moon!

415
00:32:18,944 --> 00:32:21,200
Every guardian has their own style.

416
00:32:21,224 --> 00:32:23,380
Mine, well its a work in progress.

417
00:32:24,547 --> 00:32:25,851
A work in progress?

418
00:32:25,875 --> 00:32:27,211
Oh boy!

419
00:32:27,237 --> 00:32:29,605
You have obviously never
studied the ancient books

420
00:32:29,631 --> 00:32:31,063
or any celestial laws.

421
00:32:31,087 --> 00:32:32,786
And you claim to be a guardian?

422
00:32:34,413 --> 00:32:36,130
Seriously.

423
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:37,587
You're right.

424
00:32:37,613 --> 00:32:39,641
I'm just a regular kid from the forest.

425
00:32:39,665 --> 00:32:43,002
All I'm good at is calming down
babies who have nightmares.

426
00:32:43,028 --> 00:32:45,011
But yule put me in charge

427
00:32:45,037 --> 00:32:45,979
right?

428
00:32:46,003 --> 00:32:47,910
It must be for a good reason?

429
00:32:48,170 --> 00:32:49,310
So I made one

430
00:32:49,336 --> 00:32:50,593
small mistake, but

431
00:32:50,617 --> 00:32:51,487
you!

432
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,640
I am gonna...

433
00:32:52,664 --> 00:32:53,800
Hey!

434
00:32:54,211 --> 00:32:56,377
Get back here so I can hit you.

435
00:32:56,924 --> 00:32:59,252
I'm a laughing staff because of you.

436
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:01,656
You're gonna pay for this.

437
00:33:01,682 --> 00:33:03,932
First the moon, now the sun!

438
00:33:03,958 --> 00:33:06,085
I am the one who has to clean up your mess!

439
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:06,542
But...

440
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:09,402
You're gonna have the shortest
career of any guardian ever!

441
00:33:11,826 --> 00:33:13,144
Hey! Hands off!

442
00:33:15,413 --> 00:33:17,673
Necross was the thief.

443
00:33:17,698 --> 00:33:19,298
How could only be him.

444
00:33:20,493 --> 00:33:23,113
He must've been plotting his revenge.

445
00:33:23,137 --> 00:33:28,095
Tonight mune gave him the
opportunity to take it.

446
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:29,983
Okay, let's set a few things straight.

447
00:33:30,092 --> 00:33:31,958
Here! You're the real guardian.

448
00:33:32,252 --> 00:33:34,602
Mune, you are just not up to it.

449
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:40,872
Hurry, sohone.

450
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:42,576
Without the sun's light,

451
00:33:42,602 --> 00:33:45,280
the moon will wane and could soon go out.

452
00:33:45,306 --> 00:33:47,265
Don't worry, I'm on it.

453
00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:48,938
I've to get that sun back.

454
00:33:51,105 --> 00:33:53,076
Wait, I'm coming with you.

455
00:33:56,291 --> 00:33:58,102
You are warm.

456
00:33:58,126 --> 00:34:00,420
And if you get too far away I'll freeze.

457
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:01,973
Listen sweetheart...

458
00:34:01,999 --> 00:34:03,491
You're not gonna leave me here?

459
00:34:03,517 --> 00:34:05,108
Alone...

460
00:34:05,134 --> 00:34:06,622
In the dark...

461
00:34:06,646 --> 00:34:08,083
In the forest.

462
00:34:08,108 --> 00:34:09,782
Unprotected!

463
00:34:43,170 --> 00:34:44,184
Oh no!

464
00:34:47,902 --> 00:34:49,389
What have I done?

465
00:34:49,414 --> 00:34:52,597
You destroyed what was most sacred to us.

466
00:34:54,173 --> 00:34:55,445
My friends!

467
00:34:55,818 --> 00:34:58,501
I'm sorry, I never meant to cause any harm.

468
00:34:58,527 --> 00:34:59,545
But you did.

469
00:35:00,391 --> 00:35:02,396
You are not the moon.

470
00:35:03,300 --> 00:35:05,072
I was trying to get it back.

471
00:35:05,097 --> 00:35:06,382
I almost did, but...

472
00:35:06,407 --> 00:35:09,190
Don't you realize the
consequences of what you've done?

473
00:35:10,137 --> 00:35:12,597
You don't belong here anymore.

474
00:35:14,927 --> 00:35:16,065
No!

475
00:35:16,579 --> 00:35:18,010
No! Don't leave.

476
00:35:18,034 --> 00:35:19,862
I can still fix it, I...

477
00:35:25,626 --> 00:35:26,876
Dad.

478
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,094
I'm sorry.

479
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,364
I promise I'll find a
way to make this right!

480
00:35:47,233 --> 00:35:47,907
Glim!

481
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:49,963
Gliiimmm!

482
00:35:50,704 --> 00:35:52,637
Where is that girl?

483
00:35:53,235 --> 00:35:54,672
Gliiimmm!

484
00:35:56,422 --> 00:35:57,422
Seriously?

485
00:36:02,315 --> 00:36:05,298
See, harpoons are way more
complex than they look.

486
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:06,710
If you want good results,

487
00:36:06,735 --> 00:36:09,382
you gotta handle them
with care and attention.

488
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,469
Just like the ladies.

489
00:36:11,494 --> 00:36:13,327
You're right.

490
00:36:15,429 --> 00:36:16,623
Can I get a hand here?

491
00:36:16,648 --> 00:36:17,552
I'm stuck!

492
00:36:17,577 --> 00:36:19,030
Stuck with me?

493
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:21,893
Lucky girl!

494
00:36:22,626 --> 00:36:24,989
Check me out.

495
00:36:25,014 --> 00:36:28,619
Can't find biceps like
these on night guys, han!

496
00:36:28,643 --> 00:36:29,769
By the way

497
00:36:29,797 --> 00:36:31,817
are you from night or day?

498
00:36:31,842 --> 00:36:32,858
I am mixed!

499
00:36:32,882 --> 00:36:34,336
I am from dawn and dusk.

500
00:36:34,362 --> 00:36:35,722
Do you have any problem with that?

501
00:36:35,746 --> 00:36:37,364
You are not prejudice, are you?

502
00:36:37,389 --> 00:36:39,384
What? No, of course not?

503
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:40,876
I mean is just that night guys...

504
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:42,650
They're, different.

505
00:36:43,257 --> 00:36:44,380
They scare kids.

506
00:36:44,413 --> 00:36:45,641
Wait a minute.

507
00:36:45,666 --> 00:36:48,469
The fourth star of the zebra
constellation indicates north.

508
00:36:48,494 --> 00:36:50,047
Which means we're heading east!

509
00:36:50,072 --> 00:36:52,253
We're going round in circles!

510
00:36:52,278 --> 00:36:53,278
Noooo!

511
00:36:53,304 --> 00:36:55,452
No, I know exactly where we're going.

512
00:36:57,650 --> 00:36:59,144
I know my stars, sohone.

513
00:36:59,170 --> 00:37:00,648
I'll take the lead from here.

514
00:37:17,545 --> 00:37:18,405
Really?

515
00:37:18,431 --> 00:37:21,436
No need to swoon over
three blinking insects!

516
00:37:24,603 --> 00:37:26,710
I'm coming to look for the sun with you.

517
00:37:26,735 --> 00:37:28,528
No, can't do, bug boy.

518
00:37:28,554 --> 00:37:30,755
I'm on my way down to the underworld.

519
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,545
Like you could ever handled that.

520
00:37:32,570 --> 00:37:34,356
I wanna fix the damage I did.

521
00:37:34,818 --> 00:37:36,150
That's cute.

522
00:37:36,179 --> 00:37:37,873
And what do you gonna do to necross, han!

523
00:37:37,898 --> 00:37:39,119
Sing him a lullaby!

524
00:37:39,166 --> 00:37:40,932
You won't make it through the forest alone.

525
00:37:45,469 --> 00:37:46,217
You need me.

526
00:37:46,271 --> 00:37:48,891
Finding the sun is serious
business, small fry!

527
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:50,891
You guys keep arguing that
about who is man enough

528
00:37:50,916 --> 00:37:52,097
I'm going.

529
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:58,083
Alright, you can guide
me out of the forest.

530
00:37:58,108 --> 00:37:59,780
But after that you're out of the picture.

531
00:37:59,804 --> 00:38:01,885
You are not strong enough
for what's waiting for us.

532
00:38:01,909 --> 00:38:02,639
Hurry!

533
00:38:02,664 --> 00:38:03,798
I'm freezing here!

534
00:38:13,719 --> 00:38:14,672
I am...

535
00:38:14,697 --> 00:38:16,891
Guardian of the moooonnn!

536
00:38:17,047 --> 00:38:20,074
Chu chu chu chu moon moon!

537
00:38:20,115 --> 00:38:21,721
Chu chu chu chu moon moon!

538
00:38:21,746 --> 00:38:23,338
Didn't see you there!

539
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:25,427
Now...

540
00:38:25,452 --> 00:38:28,693
Rise and go forth into the night!

541
00:38:37,614 --> 00:38:38,498
What?

542
00:38:38,523 --> 00:38:39,333
But, but...

543
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:40,889
Why won't you stay up?

544
00:38:46,489 --> 00:38:47,489
Sohone!

545
00:38:48,021 --> 00:38:50,251
Aren't you afraid of the lightning monster?

546
00:38:50,275 --> 00:38:51,239
The who?

547
00:38:51,264 --> 00:38:52,385
Well...

548
00:38:52,411 --> 00:38:55,382
You know, the ancient book say that
in order to get to the underworld,

549
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:58,454
you have to dive into a giant blue hole

550
00:38:58,478 --> 00:39:00,775
and face the terrifying, bloodsucking,

551
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,981
bone crushing lightning monster
guarding the entrance.

552
00:39:04,005 --> 00:39:05,739
No one even knows what it looks like.

553
00:39:05,764 --> 00:39:07,974
Because no one has ever
survived the journey.

554
00:39:07,998 --> 00:39:08,811
Ever!

555
00:39:09,635 --> 00:39:10,951
I don't read books, but

556
00:39:10,976 --> 00:39:12,630
I can throw a harpoon.

557
00:39:12,655 --> 00:39:14,440
You're safe as long as you stay with me.

558
00:39:14,465 --> 00:39:15,889
What about necross?

559
00:39:15,914 --> 00:39:18,434
The ancient books say he became
a gigantic lava monster who...

560
00:39:18,460 --> 00:39:19,880
I told you I don't read it!

561
00:39:34,655 --> 00:39:35,809
Leeyoon?

562
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:37,795
Whats happening with the moon?

563
00:39:37,820 --> 00:39:39,432
My powers, they're gone!

564
00:39:39,458 --> 00:39:42,471
Never fear, good people of the night

565
00:39:42,541 --> 00:39:44,958
I'm in charge now.

566
00:39:56,673 --> 00:39:58,806
We better hurry!

567
00:40:01,626 --> 00:40:02,782
Don't panic!

568
00:40:02,806 --> 00:40:04,074
Not to worry.

569
00:40:15,809 --> 00:40:17,351
The giant blue hole!

570
00:40:17,376 --> 00:40:20,380
Its exactly how the books described it.

571
00:40:20,405 --> 00:40:21,679
Amazing.

572
00:40:21,704 --> 00:40:22,289
Right!

573
00:40:22,315 --> 00:40:25,788
And how do we get down there?
Disguise ourselves as sardines?

574
00:40:29,063 --> 00:40:31,340
This algae is filled with oxygen.

575
00:40:31,365 --> 00:40:33,206
It will provide enough
air under water for...

576
00:40:33,231 --> 00:40:34,867
Ya, ya, I get it!

577
00:40:34,893 --> 00:40:35,679
OK!

578
00:40:36,065 --> 00:40:38,114
Not too, bitter for you?

579
00:40:38,139 --> 00:40:39,081
Nope.

580
00:40:39,106 --> 00:40:40,119
Delicious.

581
00:40:40,144 --> 00:40:41,059
What?

582
00:40:41,083 --> 00:40:41,978
Strange! I mean

583
00:40:42,010 --> 00:40:44,621
helium algae is known
for being quite bitter.

584
00:40:44,646 --> 00:40:46,708
You've did...

585
00:40:46,733 --> 00:40:48,585
Come here you little...

586
00:40:48,626 --> 00:40:50,882
This over here is oxygen algae.

587
00:40:53,344 --> 00:40:54,527
You see.

588
00:40:56,478 --> 00:40:57,492
Glim.

589
00:40:57,516 --> 00:40:58,523
Here's one for you.

590
00:40:58,547 --> 00:41:00,032
I won't need any.

591
00:41:00,056 --> 00:41:00,891
But...

592
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:03,297
You should, this stuff
is extra pretty good.

593
00:41:03,322 --> 00:41:05,135
The water is too cold for me.

594
00:41:05,161 --> 00:41:07,387
I might freeze and break.

595
00:41:07,413 --> 00:41:09,413
Why, you thought adventure
was all riding unicorns

596
00:41:09,438 --> 00:41:11,094
and dancing with elves?

597
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:12,414
Bad news honey!

598
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,704
We are not living in a fairy tale!

599
00:41:14,728 --> 00:41:15,844
Its gonna be okay.

600
00:41:15,869 --> 00:41:18,070
I'll take you with me.

601
00:41:18,094 --> 00:41:19,666
Hot!

602
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:27,873
Don't let me sink, okay!

603
00:41:27,898 --> 00:41:29,186
You'll be safe.

604
00:41:32,858 --> 00:41:34,735
Just, let yourself go.

605
00:41:39,269 --> 00:41:41,246
I won't let you down.

606
00:41:41,271 --> 00:41:42,699
I promise.

607
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,507
Man, you are really bad with the ladies.

608
00:42:03,532 --> 00:42:04,849
What?

609
00:42:04,873 --> 00:42:05,894
Nothing.

610
00:42:27,931 --> 00:42:28,932
You!

611
00:42:29,570 --> 00:42:30,570
Help me!

612
00:42:30,594 --> 00:42:32,311
The moon is dying.

613
00:42:35,159 --> 00:42:37,264
Hurry! I'm talking to you!

614
00:42:37,289 --> 00:42:38,440
Do something!

615
00:42:46,588 --> 00:42:47,588
No!

616
00:42:51,246 --> 00:42:52,246
No!

617
00:43:12,413 --> 00:43:13,659
No!

618
00:43:44,753 --> 00:43:45,760
Oh no!

619
00:43:45,786 --> 00:43:47,150
Its the big black house!

620
00:43:47,175 --> 00:43:48,753
Its the end of the world!

621
00:43:55,815 --> 00:43:59,307
Darkness is spreading all over the planet.

622
00:44:00,358 --> 00:44:03,018
Chaos! Chaos! Chaos! Chaos!

623
00:44:03,291 --> 00:44:05,869
Stop talking about chaos.

624
00:44:05,894 --> 00:44:07,974
I'm gonna have nightmares again.

625
00:44:09,226 --> 00:44:10,800
Chaos! Chaos! Chaos!

626
00:44:10,996 --> 00:44:12,617
Chaos! Chaos! Chaos!

627
00:44:12,869 --> 00:44:14,577
A chaos hou! A chaos hou!

628
00:44:33,052 --> 00:44:34,452
Glimmmm!

629
00:44:34,476 --> 00:44:36,530
Hey! Unhand the lady!

630
00:44:39,268 --> 00:44:40,253
Glim!

631
00:44:40,278 --> 00:44:41,612
Glim, I'm coming!

632
00:44:43,467 --> 00:44:44,507
I am here!

633
00:44:44,532 --> 00:44:46,016
Let her go!

634
00:44:55,447 --> 00:44:56,467
Glim!

635
00:45:08,885 --> 00:45:09,525
Sohone!

636
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:11,335
Sohone, do something!

637
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,360
I'm trying!

638
00:45:18,942 --> 00:45:20,067
Up there you go!

639
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,246
You got him!

640
00:45:25,628 --> 00:45:27,168
The lightning monster!

641
00:45:27,393 --> 00:45:29,255
He's gonna rip us apart!

642
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,876
Swim for your life, mune!

643
00:45:30,902 --> 00:45:32,588
Who're you calling monster!

644
00:45:32,621 --> 00:45:33,871
Snort fish.

645
00:45:33,896 --> 00:45:34,603
Hey!

646
00:45:34,628 --> 00:45:36,096
I am the guardian of the sun.

647
00:45:36,121 --> 00:45:37,181
Show some respect.

648
00:45:37,206 --> 00:45:38,273
And I'm...

649
00:45:38,297 --> 00:45:39,811
Phospho!

650
00:45:43,005 --> 00:45:45,121
Are you the guardian of the underworld?

651
00:45:45,146 --> 00:45:47,273
I used to be guardian of the moon, boko!

652
00:45:47,298 --> 00:45:49,699
For that with one I wish you holding spray.

653
00:45:49,731 --> 00:45:52,565
Come on, spiky, get the girl back now.

654
00:45:53,186 --> 00:45:54,637
Atta boy!

655
00:45:54,661 --> 00:45:56,318
A cute little chick.

656
00:45:56,344 --> 00:45:57,769
Ignore to chat here, han.

657
00:45:59,168 --> 00:46:00,896
We need to get to the underworld.

658
00:46:00,922 --> 00:46:02,355
Necross has stolen the sun.

659
00:46:02,380 --> 00:46:03,632
So why didn't you stop him?

660
00:46:03,657 --> 00:46:06,092
I thought you are the guardian?

661
00:46:06,117 --> 00:46:07,543
He sent two little devils.

662
00:46:07,568 --> 00:46:08,849
Wait.

663
00:46:08,873 --> 00:46:11,612
You got aborted by two little minions?

664
00:46:13,253 --> 00:46:14,469
No, but...

665
00:46:14,494 --> 00:46:16,028
Well its his fault.

666
00:46:16,054 --> 00:46:17,335
Quit.

667
00:46:17,367 --> 00:46:18,565
Its giving me a headache.

668
00:46:18,590 --> 00:46:19,657
Master phospho!

669
00:46:20,494 --> 00:46:21,739
I was picked by accident.

670
00:46:21,764 --> 00:46:22,418
But you...

671
00:46:22,443 --> 00:46:24,291
You are a real guardian.

672
00:46:24,315 --> 00:46:25,686
We need your help.

673
00:46:26,568 --> 00:46:28,501
I haven't heard that in a while.

674
00:46:28,525 --> 00:46:29,541
So tell me.

675
00:46:29,565 --> 00:46:31,793
Why try to take the sun back?

676
00:46:32,547 --> 00:46:34,003
To impress the ladies.

677
00:46:36,489 --> 00:46:38,010
Now you are talking?

678
00:46:41,190 --> 00:46:43,070
Impress the ladies!

679
00:46:43,096 --> 00:46:44,175
Brilliant!

680
00:47:05,844 --> 00:47:06,958
Here we are.

681
00:47:06,983 --> 00:47:08,603
On the road to the underworld.

682
00:47:09,507 --> 00:47:12,889
Come on, it got a long
and gloomy decade once.

683
00:47:12,914 --> 00:47:13,914
What about glim?

684
00:47:14,617 --> 00:47:16,228
We can't leave her like this.

685
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,481
Oh right.

686
00:47:20,014 --> 00:47:21,005
The chatty one.

687
00:47:22,322 --> 00:47:23,693
Move aside.

688
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:26,155
And let the artist work.

689
00:47:38,126 --> 00:47:39,710
Hands off!

690
00:47:39,735 --> 00:47:42,135
Is that any way to thank your savior?

691
00:47:42,161 --> 00:47:44,177
I strengthened your wax, girl!

692
00:47:44,202 --> 00:47:46,842
You should be more flexible for a change.

693
00:47:46,867 --> 00:47:48,327
Or a little kissy will do.

694
00:47:48,353 --> 00:47:50,288
Can I do that too?

695
00:47:50,313 --> 00:47:52,891
Every guardian develops his own gift.

696
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:53,922
Here's clear

697
00:47:53,947 --> 00:47:56,070
you're screwing everything off.

698
00:47:56,096 --> 00:47:57,539
Who is that guy?

699
00:47:57,565 --> 00:47:59,456
He says he was the guardian of the moon.

700
00:47:59,818 --> 00:48:00,871
Phospho, something!

701
00:48:01,166 --> 00:48:02,184
Phospho!

702
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:03,369
But the ancient books say...

703
00:48:03,394 --> 00:48:04,659
Come on!

704
00:48:04,684 --> 00:48:06,193
This way!

705
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:08,737
Mune!

706
00:48:08,762 --> 00:48:10,182
Thank you.

707
00:48:10,208 --> 00:48:11,909
For watching over for me.

708
00:48:13,036 --> 00:48:14,047
Glim.

709
00:48:14,072 --> 00:48:15,987
You can hold on to me
if you feeling scared.

710
00:48:16,021 --> 00:48:17,967
May I hold on to you too

711
00:48:18,009 --> 00:48:20,307
if I'm feeling that we
have been frightened?

712
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:21,409
No.

713
00:48:21,434 --> 00:48:22,697
Master phospho.

714
00:48:22,722 --> 00:48:24,476
I've read all the history books about him.

715
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:25,827
But you were actually there.

716
00:48:25,851 --> 00:48:28,168
Could you tell us what really
happened with necross?

717
00:48:28,193 --> 00:48:29,155
Necross

718
00:48:30,016 --> 00:48:33,878
well, a traitor, he is simply
a great guardian of the sun.

719
00:48:33,903 --> 00:48:36,413
But he is not.

720
00:48:40,315 --> 00:48:43,681
He tried to keep the sun all for himself.

721
00:48:44,445 --> 00:48:47,048
Luckily xolal stooped him.

722
00:48:47,074 --> 00:48:47,900
Xolal?

723
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,179
That dried old prune?

724
00:48:49,204 --> 00:48:51,083
Ya my friend, but then...

725
00:48:51,108 --> 00:48:54,240
He was the most powerful
warrior on the planet.

726
00:48:54,266 --> 00:48:58,523
So, there was a clash of titans.
A nasty one.

727
00:49:00,172 --> 00:49:01,704
He smashed necross...

728
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:05,025
Pulled away down, into the underworld.

729
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:06,882
And the underworld's...

730
00:49:06,907 --> 00:49:10,750
Whats waiting for you at
the bottom of this casam.

731
00:49:12,364 --> 00:49:14,715
But I don't understand why
xolal had to step in.

732
00:49:14,739 --> 00:49:15,942
As guardian of the moon,

733
00:49:15,989 --> 00:49:18,429
weren't you supposed to watch
over the harmony of the planet?

734
00:49:18,454 --> 00:49:20,052
Yes, and I did.

735
00:49:20,077 --> 00:49:22,036
I watched over the moon.

736
00:49:27,681 --> 00:49:29,557
But then why would you
into exile after that?

737
00:49:29,583 --> 00:49:31,351
Chapter 35 of the book 4 says...

738
00:49:31,376 --> 00:49:33,016
Somebody's gonna research, han?

739
00:49:33,384 --> 00:49:35,251
Well, if you know so much

740
00:49:35,275 --> 00:49:37,393
I guess you won't need my help.

741
00:49:37,418 --> 00:49:38,791
That's not what she meant. We

742
00:49:38,817 --> 00:49:40,443
good luck, kiddos.

743
00:49:42,447 --> 00:49:43,815
Nice job.

744
00:49:43,840 --> 00:49:45,434
What? I was just asking.

745
00:49:55,106 --> 00:49:56,126
The temple!

746
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:57,998
Whats it doing here?

747
00:50:04,096 --> 00:50:05,190
The moon?

748
00:50:05,215 --> 00:50:06,221
No.

749
00:50:06,284 --> 00:50:07,706
The moon is gone.

750
00:50:07,731 --> 00:50:09,074
The temple has gone insane.

751
00:50:09,099 --> 00:50:10,690
I have to stop it.

752
00:50:10,715 --> 00:50:12,139
We don't have time for that.

753
00:50:12,164 --> 00:50:13,719
The sun is dying.

754
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:15,237
It might be too late already.

755
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:17,201
You take care of the sun.

756
00:50:17,681 --> 00:50:18,791
I have to save the moon.

757
00:50:19,476 --> 00:50:22,045
No, mune, remember, the
guardians are linked.

758
00:50:22,070 --> 00:50:23,304
The ancient book said...

759
00:50:23,329 --> 00:50:25,414
You really gotta stop
reading those books, babe?

760
00:50:25,440 --> 00:50:26,489
Come on.

761
00:50:30,371 --> 00:50:32,197
Get lost, marble head!

762
00:50:42,351 --> 00:50:43,351
Goroun!

763
00:50:43,376 --> 00:50:45,054
What are you doing here?

764
00:50:46,788 --> 00:50:47,840
Come here boy!

765
00:50:53,242 --> 00:50:54,139
Quick!

766
00:50:54,164 --> 00:50:55,606
We have to catch him.

767
00:50:55,672 --> 00:50:57,617
Okay, now lets stop that temple!

768
00:50:57,641 --> 00:50:59,375
We have a planet to save.

769
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,228
Go!

770
00:51:32,945 --> 00:51:34,565
Careful!

771
00:51:35,228 --> 00:51:36,148
Don't worry.

772
00:51:37,353 --> 00:51:39,079
This I know how to do.

773
00:51:52,572 --> 00:51:53,572
Hang on!

774
00:51:59,574 --> 00:52:03,398
Mune, don't leave me! Mune!!!!

775
00:52:03,423 --> 00:52:05,967
Oh no, no, no, noooooo.

776
00:52:05,992 --> 00:52:08,588
I don't know how to steer this thing!

777
00:52:15,878 --> 00:52:16,619
Calm down!

778
00:52:16,726 --> 00:52:17,353
Calm down!

779
00:52:28,782 --> 00:52:30,195
Easy boy!

780
00:52:30,219 --> 00:52:31,432
Calm down!

781
00:52:31,458 --> 00:52:32,487
I'm here.

782
00:52:47,532 --> 00:52:48,757
Its working!

783
00:52:51,038 --> 00:52:51,835
Calm...

784
00:52:51,905 --> 00:52:53,869
Down!

785
00:53:02,893 --> 00:53:04,840
That was amazing!

786
00:53:10,791 --> 00:53:11,791
Mune!

787
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:14,217
Mune!

788
00:53:18,661 --> 00:53:19,793
Did you see that?

789
00:53:19,818 --> 00:53:21,528
My dust worked on him!

790
00:53:26,143 --> 00:53:27,344
Well, look at that.

791
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:30,516
The legend I got the temple to settle.

792
00:53:31,717 --> 00:53:32,717
He's got guts!

793
00:53:34,210 --> 00:53:37,010
Maybe more than I ever had it.

794
00:53:47,065 --> 00:53:49,097
Who is this?

795
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,798
It looks like the guardian of the sun!

796
00:53:53,110 --> 00:53:54,780
I am the guardian of the sun!

797
00:53:55,032 --> 00:53:57,597
Is that the moron who lost the sun?

798
00:53:57,623 --> 00:53:58,257
Hey!

799
00:53:58,351 --> 00:54:00,461
What a loser!

800
00:54:00,702 --> 00:54:03,034
Mune is the real hero.

801
00:54:03,858 --> 00:54:06,181
You just cleanup.

802
00:54:06,315 --> 00:54:08,847
You are just a loser.

803
00:54:09,063 --> 00:54:10,735
Useless!

804
00:54:10,974 --> 00:54:12,516
Whats he doing now?

805
00:54:13,855 --> 00:54:16,161
He wants to get by?

806
00:54:16,306 --> 00:54:17,780
Moron!

807
00:54:18,101 --> 00:54:20,172
What a pathetic hope!

808
00:54:20,449 --> 00:54:24,382
You're the worst guardian of the sun ever.

809
00:54:28,311 --> 00:54:30,375
Pathetic!

810
00:54:30,621 --> 00:54:34,347
Is that really one you gosh, sheron!

811
00:54:38,971 --> 00:54:39,971
Mother!

812
00:54:48,514 --> 00:54:49,014
Leeyoon!

813
00:54:49,389 --> 00:54:50,577
Leeyoon, where're you?

814
00:54:50,911 --> 00:54:51,891
Leeyoon.

815
00:54:51,916 --> 00:54:53,112
What are you doing?

816
00:54:53,137 --> 00:54:54,565
Leeyoon!

817
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:55,519
Come on!

818
00:54:55,740 --> 00:54:56,740
Wake up!

819
00:54:56,766 --> 00:54:57,885
Where is the moon?

820
00:54:57,931 --> 00:54:59,184
It died!

821
00:54:59,210 --> 00:55:02,427
I became a guardian and it died!

822
00:55:02,452 --> 00:55:04,041
Everything went wrong.

823
00:55:04,121 --> 00:55:05,400
Why me?

824
00:55:05,481 --> 00:55:07,239
Why me?

825
00:55:07,896 --> 00:55:09,411
So this is the end!

826
00:55:09,646 --> 00:55:10,713
Its not fair.

827
00:55:11,059 --> 00:55:12,806
How could necross betray me?

828
00:55:13,744 --> 00:55:15,545
I did everything he asked.

829
00:55:15,570 --> 00:55:17,382
Those lying snakes!

830
00:55:17,407 --> 00:55:20,295
Those lying liars!

831
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,818
Always picking on me.

832
00:55:21,842 --> 00:55:24,443
I'm in pretty quite love
of already get to know me.

833
00:55:24,469 --> 00:55:25,929
Go then yourselves...

834
00:55:26,222 --> 00:55:28,416
I will get a new moon
from the world of dreams.

835
00:55:28,782 --> 00:55:30,369
Who do you think you are?

836
00:55:31,052 --> 00:55:32,264
A God?

837
00:55:32,289 --> 00:55:34,635
You can't just create a moon.

838
00:55:35,117 --> 00:55:36,402
The first guardian did.

839
00:55:38,141 --> 00:55:40,579
We're all doomed!

840
00:55:40,605 --> 00:55:42,121
Doomed, I tell you!

841
00:55:52,525 --> 00:55:53,356
Come on glim.

842
00:55:53,858 --> 00:55:54,858
Let's go!

843
00:55:56,425 --> 00:55:58,371
Hey, wait for me.

844
00:56:04,050 --> 00:56:04,869
Hello!

845
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:16,068
What's that?

846
00:56:22,443 --> 00:56:23,643
Are we in the world of dreams?

847
00:56:23,668 --> 00:56:25,481
Nightmares... nightmare everywhere.

848
00:56:33,572 --> 00:56:34,572
Stop!

849
00:56:39,266 --> 00:56:40,146
You did it again!

850
00:56:40,751 --> 00:56:41,284
Ya.

851
00:56:42,737 --> 00:56:43,710
I have got powers!

852
00:56:48,853 --> 00:56:50,739
Maybe the moon was right after all.

853
00:56:52,525 --> 00:56:53,112
Okay!

854
00:56:53,601 --> 00:56:55,423
Now I'm gonna show these ugly monsters

855
00:56:55,449 --> 00:56:57,090
who the real master of dreams is.

856
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:00,389
Enough with the nightmares.

857
00:57:00,414 --> 00:57:02,922
Lets have some dream!

858
00:57:38,378 --> 00:57:39,777
The moon core!

859
00:57:40,585 --> 00:57:41,985
I thought that was a legend!

860
00:57:43,458 --> 00:57:45,519
By the mighty power of the guardians,

861
00:57:45,719 --> 00:57:48,896
I command a new moon to appear.

862
00:58:28,981 --> 00:58:29,835
Mune!

863
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:31,007
I saw him!

864
00:58:31,032 --> 00:58:33,813
He carved a new moon!

865
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:34,994
Who cares!

866
00:58:35,101 --> 00:58:36,054
The sun is dying.

867
00:58:36,268 --> 00:58:38,451
And the moon is as good as dead

868
00:58:42,608 --> 00:58:44,782
this is ridiculous!

869
00:58:44,869 --> 00:58:47,248
This is embarrassing!

870
00:58:48,432 --> 00:58:51,170
They call him the guardian of the sun?

871
00:58:51,284 --> 00:58:53,090
Give me a break.

872
00:58:53,115 --> 00:58:54,704
Stop it!

873
00:58:54,831 --> 00:58:56,030
I'll fight you.

874
00:58:57,458 --> 00:58:58,358
Yes!

875
00:58:58,438 --> 00:58:59,740
Such anger!

876
00:58:59,840 --> 00:59:01,067
So hatred!

877
00:59:01,327 --> 00:59:03,005
Whats happening to me?

878
00:59:03,030 --> 00:59:04,742
You are darker than necross!

879
00:59:05,184 --> 00:59:06,184
Daemon!

880
00:59:07,677 --> 00:59:09,856
You forked tongues mindless worms.

881
00:59:14,733 --> 00:59:17,510
I know you're nearby, necross

882
00:59:17,534 --> 00:59:19,510
you've spread your chaos once.

883
00:59:19,534 --> 00:59:22,579
I won't get away with it again.

884
00:59:22,849 --> 00:59:23,681
Phospho!

885
00:59:24,347 --> 00:59:27,733
That useless fraud is your backup!

886
00:59:27,757 --> 00:59:30,864
I'm surprised to see you
here, my old friend.

887
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:35,967
I thought you beclouding somewhere...
Behind the rock!

888
00:59:37,710 --> 00:59:40,146
Don't listen to these snakes, boko!

889
00:59:40,367 --> 00:59:43,744
They're trained to make evil
just like they did with necross.

890
00:59:44,619 --> 00:59:46,217
Shut up, mop.

891
00:59:46,242 --> 00:59:48,920
I've enough of your old drooling face.

892
00:59:50,516 --> 00:59:52,954
I'll crush you into dust.

893
01:00:00,746 --> 01:00:03,306
Respect the mop, kiddo!

894
01:00:04,485 --> 01:00:05,952
Back on your feet!

895
01:00:07,599 --> 01:00:09,320
Its too late!

896
01:00:19,786 --> 01:00:20,949
How're you doing that?

897
01:00:22,436 --> 01:00:23,269
I don't know.

898
01:00:23,992 --> 01:00:25,342
I just am.

899
01:00:52,293 --> 01:00:54,059
I like dreaming with you.

900
01:01:17,690 --> 01:01:18,411
I...

901
01:01:18,947 --> 01:01:20,418
I had a funny dream!

902
01:01:21,047 --> 01:01:22,166
Ya!

903
01:01:23,400 --> 01:01:24,699
Me too.

904
01:01:52,648 --> 01:01:53,181
Mune!

905
01:01:53,206 --> 01:01:54,788
I misjudged you.

906
01:01:55,503 --> 01:01:56,503
Forgive me.

907
01:01:56,956 --> 01:01:59,556
You really are the guardian of the moon.

908
01:02:04,458 --> 01:02:05,119
Well...

909
01:02:05,143 --> 01:02:06,978
I better put this back in the sky then.

910
01:02:07,630 --> 01:02:09,603
The moon can't shine
without the sun's light.

911
01:02:09,628 --> 01:02:11,505
They're connected.

912
01:02:11,530 --> 01:02:12,965
Like the guardians, remember?

913
01:02:12,989 --> 01:02:14,246
No time to lose then.

914
01:02:14,271 --> 01:02:15,525
Lets find sohone.

915
01:02:53,045 --> 01:02:54,512
Calm down, kiddo.

916
01:02:56,364 --> 01:02:58,121
Deep breath!

917
01:03:00,699 --> 01:03:01,344
Here,

918
01:03:01,592 --> 01:03:03,413
take my energy!

919
01:03:08,998 --> 01:03:10,411
You look

920
01:03:10,436 --> 01:03:12,726
much better when you shine.

921
01:03:16,568 --> 01:03:17,168
Phospho!

922
01:03:18,224 --> 01:03:19,668
Phospho, what're you doing?

923
01:03:19,693 --> 01:03:22,092
I'm going out in style.

924
01:03:22,802 --> 01:03:25,059
For the ladies, right!

925
01:03:25,438 --> 01:03:27,246
No! Nooo!

926
01:03:42,284 --> 01:03:44,023
Thank you phospho!

927
01:03:48,170 --> 01:03:51,157
Now that was a great explosion!

928
01:03:53,664 --> 01:03:55,952
You're going to have to
try a little harder.

929
01:03:55,976 --> 01:03:56,610
Spleen!

930
01:03:56,635 --> 01:04:00,139
You bunch of evil sloshing imbecile!

931
01:04:01,061 --> 01:04:04,081
I'll have to take care of this myself!

932
01:04:09,141 --> 01:04:10,164
Sohone!

933
01:04:12,016 --> 01:04:13,070
Sohone!

934
01:04:13,096 --> 01:04:14,262
Glim!

935
01:04:14,286 --> 01:04:15,289
Mune!

936
01:04:15,313 --> 01:04:17,657
I think I was never gonna see you again.

937
01:04:22,152 --> 01:04:23,942
Hot! Hot! Hot! Hot!

938
01:04:26,722 --> 01:04:28,563
We missed you too, my friend.

939
01:04:30,322 --> 01:04:31,166
Well!

940
01:04:31,192 --> 01:04:32,221
Shall we.

941
01:04:59,786 --> 01:05:02,101
Welcome guardians.

942
01:05:02,126 --> 01:05:03,172
Necross!

943
01:05:03,197 --> 01:05:06,666
The sun and the moon in the underworld?!

944
01:05:06,692 --> 01:05:08,092
What a treat!

945
01:05:08,117 --> 01:05:09,239
Hang on.

946
01:05:11,492 --> 01:05:12,992
Sohone, watch out!

947
01:05:13,016 --> 01:05:14,137
Get the sun.

948
01:05:14,161 --> 01:05:15,931
I'll take care of lava pan.

949
01:05:17,661 --> 01:05:20,371
You shall know come for
them for such a failure.

950
01:05:20,396 --> 01:05:22,920
You brought disgrace in the
guardians of the sun's honor.

951
01:05:22,945 --> 01:05:24,938
I'm gonna enjoy crushing you.

952
01:05:25,628 --> 01:05:27,094
Quick, we gotta go.

953
01:05:41,273 --> 01:05:43,148
You're mine, sucker

954
01:05:43,259 --> 01:05:47,728
and right now your girlfriend is in
the clutches of my evil accomplice.

955
01:05:47,753 --> 01:05:49,367
Yellow flowers are nice,

956
01:05:49,391 --> 01:05:50,996
but they're more fragile, right?

957
01:05:51,021 --> 01:05:52,588
Right... and...

958
01:05:52,614 --> 01:05:53,809
That's why I gotta go.

959
01:05:53,833 --> 01:05:55,079
Gotta water them.

960
01:05:55,105 --> 01:05:56,418
Of course.

961
01:05:56,443 --> 01:05:57,443
Bye then!

962
01:06:00,086 --> 01:06:03,684
You thought you can spread
darkness on my planet?

963
01:06:03,708 --> 01:06:05,376
Then get away with it.

964
01:06:06,507 --> 01:06:08,731
Not on my watch.

965
01:06:13,918 --> 01:06:15,385
You're too late.

966
01:06:15,699 --> 01:06:17,239
The sun is dead.

967
01:06:20,143 --> 01:06:23,496
There's nothing you can do
to save you planet now.

968
01:06:25,565 --> 01:06:27,351
Oh yaa?

969
01:06:28,161 --> 01:06:30,161
Take this!

970
01:06:32,364 --> 01:06:35,411
You bite like a mosquito.

971
01:06:41,739 --> 01:06:42,998
That hurts!

972
01:06:53,081 --> 01:06:53,773
Glim!

973
01:06:54,400 --> 01:06:55,467
Don't go any closer.

974
01:06:57,882 --> 01:06:58,735
Got ya now.

975
01:06:58,889 --> 01:07:00,536
Its chaos time!

976
01:07:46,561 --> 01:07:47,333
Glim!

977
01:07:47,947 --> 01:07:50,369
She is gonna make a nice candle.

978
01:07:50,456 --> 01:07:53,168
Get your stinking breath out of my face.

979
01:07:58,420 --> 01:07:59,081
Glim!

980
01:08:32,722 --> 01:08:33,789
I saved the sun!

981
01:08:35,268 --> 01:08:35,768
Ya.

982
01:08:36,261 --> 01:08:37,261
You did.

983
01:08:37,568 --> 01:08:39,698
You have to help sohone.

984
01:08:40,259 --> 01:08:41,220
No!

985
01:08:41,246 --> 01:08:43,179
No, I need to save you.

986
01:08:43,203 --> 01:08:44,105
No.

987
01:08:44,131 --> 01:08:45,369
It's too late for me.

988
01:08:46,539 --> 01:08:48,537
But, you can defeat necross!

989
01:08:50,278 --> 01:08:52,653
I have seen your power.

990
01:08:52,677 --> 01:08:55,132
Go!

991
01:08:55,158 --> 01:08:56,828
My sandman.

992
01:09:12,631 --> 01:09:16,831
You think you can light the
sun just by puffing it.

993
01:09:16,855 --> 01:09:20,884
I'll blow it down quicker than
it took your girlfriend to melt

994
01:09:21,101 --> 01:09:24,576
you're trapped, little blue rat.

995
01:09:31,027 --> 01:09:31,735
Sohone!

996
01:09:32,649 --> 01:09:33,597
Quick, mune

997
01:09:33,622 --> 01:09:34,488
get out of here!

998
01:09:35,259 --> 01:09:36,636
I can't hold it for long.

999
01:09:36,662 --> 01:09:39,246
I have enough of you. Die

1000
01:09:39,270 --> 01:09:40,161
insects.

1001
01:09:59,747 --> 01:10:01,135
What's going on?

1002
01:10:02,737 --> 01:10:04,270
I can feel it too.

1003
01:10:05,903 --> 01:10:07,542
Let's show him what we're made of.

1004
01:10:07,608 --> 01:10:10,895
Yah, lets finish him off.

1005
01:10:18,564 --> 01:10:19,564
I got him.

1006
01:10:20,805 --> 01:10:22,466
Nighty night!

1007
01:10:24,033 --> 01:10:24,752
What?

1008
01:10:25,171 --> 01:10:26,757
What've you done to me?

1009
01:10:27,358 --> 01:10:29,211
You're taking a nap, big guy.

1010
01:10:29,238 --> 01:10:30,238
I put you to sleep.

1011
01:10:30,684 --> 01:10:32,317
You dirty little blue rat!

1012
01:10:34,417 --> 01:10:35,951
I am the master of dreams.

1013
01:10:36,317 --> 01:10:37,997
There's nothing you can you do to me here.

1014
01:10:38,021 --> 01:10:39,261
You're gonna pay.

1015
01:10:40,011 --> 01:10:41,729
You really need a cook.

1016
01:10:55,594 --> 01:10:57,728
Hold still, dummy.

1017
01:11:20,832 --> 01:11:23,153
This snake has been squeezing
your heart for too long.

1018
01:12:09,123 --> 01:12:09,623
Mune!

1019
01:12:11,752 --> 01:12:12,338
Mune!

1020
01:12:15,943 --> 01:12:17,975
You pulled out the fires of the underworld.

1021
01:12:23,984 --> 01:12:25,737
That was epic!

1022
01:12:36,837 --> 01:12:38,570
I never thought I'd say this, but...

1023
01:12:38,869 --> 01:12:39,521
Bro!

1024
01:12:40,350 --> 01:12:43,708
You really are the most
powerful guardian of all time.

1025
01:12:54,158 --> 01:12:55,158
You okay, mox?

1026
01:12:55,432 --> 01:12:57,078
I bloomed.

1027
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,990
We're gonna be fine here.

1028
01:14:57,635 --> 01:14:58,902
That's mune!

1029
01:14:58,926 --> 01:15:00,206
The guardian of the moon.

1030
01:15:01,655 --> 01:15:03,615
Ya, I always knew he would make it.

1031
01:15:05,229 --> 01:15:06,055
What?

1032
01:15:53,360 --> 01:15:54,360
Glim!

1033
01:15:55,132 --> 01:15:56,033
Glim!

1034
01:16:02,011 --> 01:16:04,304
This is gonna be good!

1035
01:17:19,368 --> 01:17:20,368
Glim!

1036
01:17:21,537 --> 01:17:23,436
Sohone!

1037
01:17:23,462 --> 01:17:24,462
Glim!

1038
01:17:32,405 --> 01:17:34,617
Glim! Glim! I'm over here!

1039
01:17:34,640 --> 01:17:36,537
Daddy loves you!

1040
01:17:36,538 --> 01:17:39,515
Sweetheart! Glim look around.
I'm on the left.

1041
01:18:21,654 --> 01:18:23,326
My baby kid...

1042
01:18:57,880 --> 01:18:59,768
I love happy endings!

1043
01:19:01,899 --> 01:19:03,157
My bad!
