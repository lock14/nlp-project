1
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:22,238
<i>William:
Here's how the story was told to me.</i>

2
00:00:22,338 --> 00:00:25,288
<i>I always say
I got things wrong</i>

3
00:00:29,662 --> 00:00:32,662
<i>I waited here
a little too long</i>

4
00:00:39,222 --> 00:00:42,172
Hey, hey. What y'all doing?

5
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,095
<i>Say Jesse, how 'bout you talk
Danielle out of being mad at me?</i>

6
00:00:45,195 --> 00:00:47,464
And both of y'all hop in the car
with me and Vince here.

7
00:00:47,564 --> 00:00:49,666
<i>And we can all take
a spin into Dallas?</i>

8
00:00:49,766 --> 00:00:51,601
We got school tomorrow, stupid.

9
00:00:51,701 --> 00:00:53,837
Oh come on, Jesse.

10
00:00:53,937 --> 00:00:58,442
We'll be back before anybody
gets in any real trouble.

11
00:00:58,558 --> 00:01:01,895
Y'all know Vince?
This here is Vince Hardin.

12
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:05,225
<i>Vince this is Jesse
and that one's Dan.</i>

13
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:08,551
Dan's a little mad
at me right now.

14
00:01:08,651 --> 00:01:10,286
I'm not mad at you,
John Jaegerman.

15
00:01:10,386 --> 00:01:13,336
I'm just bored with you.

16
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,558
<i>John:
Jesse will you tell Dan</i>

17
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:18,560
<i>that she's the only girl
I'll ever love.</i>

18
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,796
<i>Danielle:
Jesse will you tell John</i>

19
00:01:19,896 --> 00:01:20,930
<i>to please think about that
the next time</i>

20
00:01:21,030 --> 00:01:22,966
<i>he decides to steal a car?</i>

21
00:01:23,066 --> 00:01:24,868
<i>John:
They didn't even press any charges.</i>

22
00:01:24,968 --> 00:01:27,070
<i>They knew I was just
goofing around.</i>

23
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,938
What about you,
Mr. Vince?

24
00:01:29,038 --> 00:01:30,273
<i>Do you talk?</i>

25
00:01:30,373 --> 00:01:32,142
I know a joke.

26
00:01:32,242 --> 00:01:33,443
<i>Jesse:
Well let's hear it.</i>

27
00:01:33,543 --> 00:01:36,493
Okay.

28
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:39,783
There's these two monks, alright?

29
00:01:39,883 --> 00:01:41,851
There's like
a regular monk guy.

30
00:01:41,951 --> 00:01:43,019
<i>William:
My mother didn't need to hear the joke.</i>

31
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,434
<i>She was already
dead bull's eye in love.</i>

32
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,725
<i>She listened to the sound
of his voice,</i>

33
00:01:48,825 --> 00:01:51,394
<i>thinking what a good father
he'd make.</i>

34
00:01:51,494 --> 00:01:54,447
<i>And the guy says
"Well, I'm not into fish</i>

35
00:01:54,547 --> 00:01:59,392
but I sure am going to love
working with you fuckin' guys.

36
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,408
Come on, Dan,
let's go to Dallas.

37
00:02:05,508 --> 00:02:08,458
<i>Now I'm stuck here -
looking by</i>

38
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:15,065
<i>Where I lost a friend</i>

39
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:21,224
<i>Jesse:
It's a nice car.</i>

40
00:02:21,324 --> 00:02:24,274
<i>Vince:
It's just a 'Cuda.</i>

41
00:02:25,311 --> 00:02:28,311
<i>Oh, I have lost my head</i>

42
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:37,053
<i>Way back
when the world was young</i>

43
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:42,893
<i>Long before
this song was sung</i>

44
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,117
<i>William:
Three weeks later,</i>

45
00:02:47,217 --> 00:02:49,853
<i>I was conceived
in the back of that Plymouth.</i>

46
00:02:49,953 --> 00:02:52,855
<i>I was thinkin' a lot
about that story.</i>

47
00:02:52,955 --> 00:02:55,891
<i>I wondered if sex
was easier in Texas</i>

48
00:02:55,991 --> 00:02:58,975
<i>than it was in New York.</i>

49
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:09,829
<i>I wondered how my father
a talked to my mother.</i>

50
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,975
<i>I wondered how
other men in general</i>

51
00:03:12,075 --> 00:03:15,390
<i>behaved when they were
alone with women.</i>

52
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:19,029
<i>No matter
how long it takes</i>

53
00:03:22,669 --> 00:03:25,669
<i>One day
the dam will break</i>

54
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,209
<i>One day
the tears will fall</i>

55
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:38,715
<i>Just by the waterfall</i>

56
00:03:56,903 --> 00:04:00,983
"My heart is gold,
what will you give me for it?"

57
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:18,308
<i>No matter
how long it takes</i>

58
00:04:43,016 --> 00:04:45,702
Sarah doesn't think men
have vaginas.

59
00:04:45,802 --> 00:04:47,203
Yeah, well,
I agree with her.

60
00:04:47,303 --> 00:04:48,271
What?

61
00:04:48,371 --> 00:04:50,640
I said, I don't have a vagina.

62
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,690
Yeah, you do.

63
00:04:55,094 --> 00:04:57,614
Hi, I'm William.

64
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:58,781
I'm an actor.

65
00:04:58,881 --> 00:05:02,168
So I'm totally full of shit.
Don't believe a word I say.

66
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,520
I just figured I should
tell you that right off the bat

67
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,123
so you don't
get disappointed later.

68
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:09,025
Have you ever seen
'Star Trek'?

69
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:10,627
The original one?

70
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:13,196
Well, I'm kind of like
Spock in that episode

71
00:05:13,296 --> 00:05:16,716
where he tells the replicants
that everything he says is a lie.

72
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,335
And they go, "If everything
you say is a lie,

73
00:05:19,435 --> 00:05:21,671
then you're lying now,
which means you're telling the truth,

74
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:23,239
which means you're lying. "

75
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:25,775
<i>And then smoke
comes out of their ears.</i>

76
00:05:25,875 --> 00:05:29,195
<i>and they malfunction,
and he gets to escape.</i>

77
00:05:29,295 --> 00:05:30,880
See, you just
seem a little stiff to me,

78
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:35,101
and I'm trying to make sure
you're not a replicant.

79
00:05:35,201 --> 00:05:38,201
Do you speak English?

80
00:05:38,805 --> 00:05:40,189
Yes.

81
00:05:40,289 --> 00:05:43,409
<i>Good. I was worried you
didn't understand a word I said.</i>

82
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:45,795
Don't worry;
you're not that complicated.

83
00:05:45,895 --> 00:05:49,040
- What?
- You're not that complicated.

84
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:52,382
Thanks.

85
00:05:55,355 --> 00:05:58,355
Are you nervous?

86
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,192
No, I'm not nervous.

87
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,130
Why would I be nervous?

88
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:14,683
Okay, I'm nervous all the time.
I don't know why.

89
00:06:16,342 --> 00:06:17,960
Me too.

90
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,010
<i>One day,
the dam will break.</i>

91
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,933
<i>Sarah:
So, you're really an actor?</i>

92
00:06:24,033 --> 00:06:26,102
William:
Yeah.

93
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:29,689
I've got an audition for the movie
version of Camino Real tomorrow.

94
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:31,074
You ever read that play?

95
00:06:31,174 --> 00:06:32,342
No.

96
00:06:32,442 --> 00:06:34,811
- Tennessee Williams.
- No.

97
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:36,679
Me neither.

98
00:06:36,779 --> 00:06:40,009
My lines are good, though.
I read them.

99
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:42,485
Well, don't you have to read
the whole play?

100
00:06:42,585 --> 00:06:45,254
Yeah, I guess I should, huh.

101
00:06:45,354 --> 00:06:48,157
I tried. It's just really weird.

102
00:06:48,257 --> 00:06:51,060
It's about a bunch of people
unhappy 'cause they're not sure

103
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,110
if they're living
or they're dead.

104
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:57,266
Why do you
want to be an actor?

105
00:06:57,366 --> 00:06:58,768
I don't, really.

106
00:06:58,868 --> 00:07:02,755
It's the only thing
I've ever really been good at.

107
00:07:02,855 --> 00:07:04,407
I want to be
a singer.

108
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,608
Oh yeah?

109
00:07:05,708 --> 00:07:08,044
You going to be a star?

110
00:07:08,144 --> 00:07:09,612
I want to be a musician.

111
00:07:09,712 --> 00:07:12,662
Okay, that's cool.

112
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,751
I don't want to be famous,
you know.

113
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:16,835
I like to sing.

114
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:18,488
I want to do what I love.

115
00:07:18,588 --> 00:07:20,990
Are you any good?

116
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,041
It's not important.

117
00:07:23,141 --> 00:07:24,360
Are you any good?

118
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,162
- I'm great.
- Oh yeah?

119
00:07:26,262 --> 00:07:27,697
Yeah.

120
00:07:27,797 --> 00:07:30,266
I'm tellin' you, there's
nothin' I can do about it.

121
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:31,834
I'm just great.

122
00:07:31,934 --> 00:07:34,884
Okay, well,
do something for me.

123
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:42,137
"My heart is gold,
what will you give me for it?"

124
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:43,880
What's that?

125
00:07:43,980 --> 00:07:45,964
Tennessee.

126
00:07:46,064 --> 00:07:48,818
I'm just whoever
I pretend to be.

127
00:07:48,918 --> 00:07:51,487
You ever feel like that,
like all you are

128
00:07:51,587 --> 00:07:56,177
is the person you were pretending
to be in high school?

129
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,928
No.

130
00:07:59,028 --> 00:08:00,563
Don't worry,
you are somebody.

131
00:08:00,663 --> 00:08:04,484
If you'd stop pretending,
it'll come out all by itself.

132
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:06,269
Do you want to get married?

133
00:08:06,369 --> 00:08:09,319
No.

134
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:12,308
I don't want to be an actor.

135
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:14,210
It's a little disappointing
when your best quality

136
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,679
is pretending
to be someone else.

137
00:08:16,779 --> 00:08:20,179
I want to be somebody
specific, you know.

138
00:08:22,134 --> 00:08:23,553
I was born in Texas.

139
00:08:23,653 --> 00:08:26,289
But I left there
when I was eight.

140
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:27,990
Sometimes, I think,
if I had just stayed,

141
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:31,235
I could be a regular person,
you know.

142
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:33,563
Billy, the lumber guy,
or whatever.

143
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:36,232
Instead of running around
with my head cut off.

144
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:38,434
Why'd you leave Texas?

145
00:08:38,534 --> 00:08:41,484
My mom had wanderlust.

146
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,039
What about your dad?

147
00:08:43,139 --> 00:08:46,089
I don't really know him.

148
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,445
Don't smoke that.

149
00:08:49,545 --> 00:08:51,948
Why not?

150
00:08:52,048 --> 00:08:55,278
Because I'm thinking
about kissing you.

151
00:08:55,401 --> 00:08:58,369
Okay, good to know.

152
00:08:58,469 --> 00:09:01,437
It's good to know.

153
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:05,862
<i>Sarah: So you're going to be
a big movie star, huh?</i>

154
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:08,912
<i>William:
Yeah, it's my destiny.</i>

155
00:09:09,849 --> 00:09:11,601
<i>Sarah:
Oh God, you're unbelievable.</i>

156
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:13,669
<i>William:
I try to be.</i>

157
00:09:13,769 --> 00:09:17,221
<i>Born yesterday,
but I stayed up all night.</i>

158
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:20,857
This is my door.

159
00:09:21,594 --> 00:09:23,846
You live here?

160
00:09:23,946 --> 00:09:25,314
<i>Yeah.</i>

161
00:09:25,414 --> 00:09:28,364
Oh shit! Really?

162
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:31,554
That's my window.

163
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:34,884
My window looks out
on your front door.

164
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,626
Well -

165
00:09:36,726 --> 00:09:38,327
I just got to New York City
tonight.

166
00:09:38,427 --> 00:09:39,395
I'm staying
with a friend.

167
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:41,063
Come here;
come here, come here.

168
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,231
<i>Do me a favor,
stand right here.</i>

169
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:43,699
<i>Sarah:
Okay!</i>

170
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,668
- Why?
- Right there, just like that.

171
00:09:45,768 --> 00:09:47,503
That's good,
one second.

172
00:09:47,603 --> 00:09:49,605
I feel weird.

173
00:09:49,705 --> 00:09:52,655
<i>What am I doing here?</i>

174
00:09:54,994 --> 00:09:57,213
<i>What?</i>

175
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:35,418
<i>William:
Looking out at what was now her door,</i>

176
00:10:35,518 --> 00:10:39,853
<i>I had the profound feeling
that my life had changed.</i>

177
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,539
<i>And I was right
not in the way I thought.</i>

178
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,711
<i>I hadn't met the woman
I was to grow gray with.</i>

179
00:10:46,811 --> 00:10:48,197
<i>I was twenty years old</i>

180
00:10:48,297 --> 00:10:51,247
<i>and, by the time
I was twenty-one</i>

181
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:54,517
<i>I'd be heartbroken.</i>

182
00:11:10,236 --> 00:11:11,354
<i>Sarah:
Hi.</i>

183
00:11:11,454 --> 00:11:14,290
<i>William: Nice to see you.
What's your name again?</i>

184
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,225
You don't
remember my name?

185
00:11:16,325 --> 00:11:18,961
I'm kidding.

186
00:11:19,061 --> 00:11:20,863
Oh my God,
did I do that?

187
00:11:20,963 --> 00:11:23,532
Yeah.

188
00:11:23,632 --> 00:11:25,167
Are you mad?

189
00:11:25,267 --> 00:11:26,802
No.

190
00:11:26,902 --> 00:11:29,238
<i>Do you do
that all the time?</i>

191
00:11:29,338 --> 00:11:32,288
<i>Do what?</i>

192
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,744
Kiss girls?

193
00:11:34,844 --> 00:11:39,774
<i>Dave: Hey Sarah, we'll start
in about ten minutes, alright?</i>

194
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:44,320
Is she okay?

195
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,421
I think southing's wrong
with her microphone.

196
00:11:45,521 --> 00:11:48,090
<i>I'll get it.</i>

197
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:49,959
<i>William:
Hey Sarah -</i>

198
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:54,647
<i>that dude said he'd take care
of the microphone business.</i>

199
00:11:54,747 --> 00:11:57,747
- What?
- Come here.

200
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:00,036
<i>Sarah:
I'm behaving ridiculously.</i>

201
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,303
<i>William:
Yeah, you are.</i>

202
00:12:01,403 --> 00:12:02,438
<i>Sarah:
I'm sorry about the hickey thing.</i>

203
00:12:02,538 --> 00:12:05,488
<i>William:
It' A. O. K.</i>

204
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:16,252
<i>Sarah:
You should go now.</i>

205
00:12:16,352 --> 00:12:19,302
<i>William:
Okay. Good luck.</i>

206
00:12:20,439 --> 00:12:21,524
<i>Okay.</i>

207
00:12:21,624 --> 00:12:22,591
William:
Just pretend you're someone else.

208
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:24,160
What?

209
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:26,128
Think of your favorite singer,

210
00:12:26,228 --> 00:12:28,097
and just start out
by pretending to be her.

211
00:12:28,197 --> 00:12:32,277
The rest'll come easy,
and it'll secretly be you.

212
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:36,319
Can I borrow
your jacket?

213
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:46,332
<i>Vince:
Come on buddy, take off your jacket.</i>

214
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:50,311
<i>Come on it's hot
as hell in here, man.</i>

215
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:57,073
<i>Come on buddy
take off your jacket.</i>

216
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,695
<i>Now listen to me, William,</i>

217
00:12:59,795 --> 00:13:01,864
<i>your mother and
you are moving away -</i>

218
00:13:01,964 --> 00:13:04,899
<i>and I can't come after you.</i>

219
00:13:04,999 --> 00:13:07,984
<i>I can't -
because I can't.</i>

220
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,706
<i>You know I'm going to try
to get some money together -</i>

221
00:13:10,806 --> 00:13:13,042
<i>and visit you
as much as I can,</i>

222
00:13:13,142 --> 00:13:16,797
but it won't be
as often as I want, alright.

223
00:13:20,766 --> 00:13:23,718
But it's killing me, alright?

224
00:13:23,818 --> 00:13:27,048
I mean, it's -
it's really killing me.

225
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:32,090
And I want you
to remember one thing.

226
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:35,178
<i>Can you hear me?</i>

227
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:38,300
<i>Just remember one thing.</i>

228
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:41,970
I am not the one -
leaving Texas, alright.

229
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:46,122
Will you remember that?

230
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:53,796
Come on,
take off your jacket.

231
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,672
<i>Sometimes
when we meet up yonder</i>

232
00:14:06,712 --> 00:14:09,712
<i>We'll stroll
hand in hand again</i>

233
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:16,819
<i>In the land
that knows no parting</i>

234
00:14:21,093 --> 00:14:24,093
<i>Blue eyes crying
in the rain</i>

235
00:14:32,571 --> 00:14:35,571
That's my jacket.

236
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:39,461
<i>William: You know what I'm going
to do? I'm going to buy a car -</i>

237
00:14:39,561 --> 00:14:41,897
<i>an old silver one
with a big dashboard -</i>

238
00:14:41,997 --> 00:14:44,500
<i>and drive you down
to Nashville.</i>

239
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,268
<i>Take you
to the Grand Ole Orpy.</i>

240
00:14:46,368 --> 00:14:49,318
<i>Make you a big
motherfucking star.</i>

241
00:14:49,755 --> 00:14:51,440
Can I sing
Johnny Cash?

242
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,642
Are you kidding?

243
00:14:53,742 --> 00:14:56,692
Why don't you
move in with me?

244
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:58,848
I came to New York
to be on my own.

245
00:14:58,948 --> 00:15:01,450
I'll move out.

246
00:15:01,550 --> 00:15:04,500
Sorry.

247
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:08,638
I found my own place.

248
00:15:09,508 --> 00:15:12,194
But I'll stay with you until
my lease starts, if you want.

249
00:15:12,294 --> 00:15:15,244
I want.
Yeah, that'd be good.

250
00:15:16,548 --> 00:15:19,007
But I won't
have sex with you.

251
00:15:19,107 --> 00:15:20,936
Why not?

252
00:15:21,036 --> 00:15:23,505
Because I have a scar
right here.

253
00:15:23,605 --> 00:15:25,374
That's okay.

254
00:15:25,474 --> 00:15:28,424
I got lots of scars.

255
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:32,161
Okay - then I'll sleep over.

256
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,218
<i>William:
But you won't have sex with me?</i>

257
00:15:36,318 --> 00:15:38,821
<i>Sarah: I'll have sex with you
when I have my own apartment.</i>

258
00:15:38,921 --> 00:15:40,322
<i>William:
So it's kind of like an audition?</i>

259
00:15:40,422 --> 00:15:42,925
<i>Sarah:
Yeah.</i>

260
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,975
<i>William:
I hope I get a callback.</i>

261
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,736
<i>It was Wednesday
when we met,</i>

262
00:15:53,836 --> 00:15:56,605
<i>Saturday when I asked her
to move in -</i>

263
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:59,725
<i>and by Sunday there were
flowers in my apartment -</i>

264
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:02,191
<i>and humus
in my refrigerator.</i>

265
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:05,147
<i>I don't remember
waking up that Sunday.</i>

266
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:08,117
<i>I don't think I ever slept.</i>

267
00:16:08,217 --> 00:16:10,252
<i>I just sat there
thinking -</i>

268
00:16:10,352 --> 00:16:13,922
<i>Goddamn, this must
be what praying is like.</i>

269
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:37,681
All right, ma'am,
where would you like this?

270
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:47,406
- You really got that part?
- I really did.

271
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,692
You're really
going to be in a movie.

272
00:16:49,792 --> 00:16:50,859
- Yeah.
- That's awesome.

273
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,995
We leave for Mexico
in a month.

274
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,964
That's where
we're shootin' it.

275
00:16:55,064 --> 00:16:58,014
Oh cool!
Mexico - sounds like fun.

276
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,774
You know what we should do?

277
00:17:00,874 --> 00:17:03,205
We should paint.

278
00:17:03,305 --> 00:17:04,606
<i>Aren't you sleepy?</i>

279
00:17:04,706 --> 00:17:05,841
No, I think
we should paint.

280
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,376
Alright.

281
00:17:09,678 --> 00:17:12,628
Well, what
do you want to do?

282
00:17:13,766 --> 00:17:15,947
You know
what I want to do.

283
00:17:16,047 --> 00:17:18,454
But painting's okay.

284
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:26,375
<i>William:
What's your shirt say?</i>

285
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:30,265
I love to fuck.

286
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:40,676
Does that
make you feel tough?

287
00:17:40,776 --> 00:17:42,211
It does.

288
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:45,564
Well, you better get
serious about your painting -

289
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,149
because we're not going
to go to bed tonight

290
00:17:47,249 --> 00:17:50,199
'til this whole apartment
is blue.

291
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:54,573
<i>Sarah: You're the type of boy who
gets girls pregnant. Do you know that?</i>

292
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:58,498
Yeah, my mother used to
say that all the time.

293
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:05,300
<i>Sarah:
You should think of me as very fragile.</i>

294
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,137
<i>I just didn't want to
be feeling this way right now.</i>

295
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:10,275
<i>William:
How do you feel?</i>

296
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,641
<i>Sarah:
Don't play dumb.</i>

297
00:18:12,741 --> 00:18:15,691
<i>I'm here to be on my own.</i>

298
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:19,979
<i>I'll probably just run away
and leave you crushed.</i>

299
00:18:20,079 --> 00:18:22,351
<i>William:
No, you can't hurt me.</i>

300
00:18:22,451 --> 00:18:24,019
<i>That's the problem.</i>

301
00:18:24,119 --> 00:18:26,755
<i>You just got to stick around
and hear the jokes.</i>

302
00:18:26,855 --> 00:18:29,491
<i>Sarah:
Oh brother!</i>

303
00:18:50,696 --> 00:18:51,914
<i>William:
Do you know how dumb I feel?</i>

304
00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:53,415
<i>Sarah:
What do you mean?</i>

305
00:18:53,515 --> 00:18:54,550
<i>William:
When you're thinking about sex</i>

306
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,819
<i>like twenty-four hour a day-</i>

307
00:18:56,919 --> 00:19:00,914
<i>it significantly deteriorates
your intelligence.</i>

308
00:19:02,341 --> 00:19:04,560
<i>Sarah:
You know what?</i>

309
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:06,862
We should have done it
that first night.

310
00:19:06,962 --> 00:19:10,549
That first night we kissed,
I wanted to sleep with you.

311
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,534
You're just giving me
too much time to think.

312
00:19:12,634 --> 00:19:15,037
I didn't think it was
going to be a one-shot deal.

313
00:19:15,137 --> 00:19:17,439
Oh, come on.

314
00:19:17,539 --> 00:19:19,274
When's it going to get ugly?

315
00:19:19,374 --> 00:19:22,324
When's it going to get abusive?

316
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:26,348
I don't know,
but it always does.

317
00:19:26,448 --> 00:19:27,783
What kind of shit
do you think we'll say

318
00:19:27,883 --> 00:19:30,833
about each other
after we break up?

319
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:32,354
"Frigid bitch. "

320
00:19:32,454 --> 00:19:35,404
"All he thinks about
is himself. "

321
00:19:35,641 --> 00:19:37,659
"She's really
still just a child. "

322
00:19:37,759 --> 00:19:39,856
"He doesn't ever listen. "

323
00:19:39,956 --> 00:19:41,597
"Oh, she's completely
without talent. "

324
00:19:41,697 --> 00:19:45,607
"Oh, he calls himself
an actor? What a phoney. "

325
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,685
Isn't it strange
that'll happen?

326
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:53,155
I'll come in here
one night -

327
00:19:54,726 --> 00:19:57,726
"Listen, we got to talk. "

328
00:19:57,829 --> 00:19:59,114
"What is it?"

329
00:19:59,214 --> 00:20:00,616
"It's just I've been
thinking and -"

330
00:20:00,716 --> 00:20:02,117
"And what?"

331
00:20:02,217 --> 00:20:03,652
"I just need
a little space is all. "

332
00:20:03,752 --> 00:20:05,020
"Space for what?"

333
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,389
"Look, don't make this
any harder than it is.

334
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:09,525
I don't make you happy,
you don't make me happy. "

335
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:13,960
"Yes, yes, you do.
We can work this out, I love you.

336
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,797
You're seeing
someone else. "

337
00:20:15,897 --> 00:20:16,999
"No! Don't say that.

338
00:20:17,099 --> 00:20:18,300
- "Who is it?"
- "It doesn't matter. "

339
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,835
- "Who is it?"
- "It doesn't matter. "

340
00:20:19,935 --> 00:20:22,837
- "Who is it?"
- "See, I can't even talk to you. "

341
00:20:22,937 --> 00:20:25,407
"I always knew
you didn't care about me.

342
00:20:25,507 --> 00:20:28,076
You just needed
someone to talk at.

343
00:20:28,176 --> 00:20:30,679
I could have been any girl. "

344
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:33,697
"Now, don't go feeling
sorry for yourself.

345
00:20:33,797 --> 00:20:36,772
The point is,
it's over. It was fun,

346
00:20:37,169 --> 00:20:41,043
but I'm just not
boyfriend material, you know?"

347
00:20:41,143 --> 00:20:42,791
Okay.

348
00:20:42,891 --> 00:20:44,660
I think we have to stop now
because -

349
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,129
Oh my God,
I'm so stupid.

350
00:20:47,229 --> 00:20:48,630
<i>I'm so stupid.</i>

351
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:51,600
<i>I can't do this with you.</i>

352
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:53,702
<i>- We were joking.
- I can't do that.</i>

353
00:20:53,802 --> 00:20:55,170
<i>I don't what a boyfriend
right now.</i>

354
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:58,457
Don't start having some self-fulfilling
prophesy that I'm going to hurt you.

355
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,175
<i>I promised myself
I wasn't going to do this.</i>

356
00:21:00,275 --> 00:21:02,644
Listen, if you could be
inside my body

357
00:21:02,744 --> 00:21:04,546
when I see you,
or touch you -

358
00:21:04,646 --> 00:21:06,181
or think that I might see you,
or touch you -

359
00:21:06,281 --> 00:21:07,783
you would stop crying
and slap me -

360
00:21:07,883 --> 00:21:09,251
because I'm either
crazy about you,

361
00:21:09,351 --> 00:21:12,301
or, I'm going crazy.

362
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,122
You are crazy.

363
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:16,725
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

364
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:19,778
Well, if you don't say, "I'm going
to get over my stupid hang-ups -

365
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:22,380
and fall desperately
in love" -

366
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,799
I'm going to
jump off this bed.

367
00:21:23,899 --> 00:21:25,133
<i>I'm not going to say that.</i>

368
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:27,218
Say it!

369
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:29,204
<i>I don't have
any stupid hang-ups.</i>

370
00:21:29,304 --> 00:21:30,439
Oh, you better say it!

371
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:31,506
<i>You know what?</i>

372
00:21:31,606 --> 00:21:34,556
Just - just stop.

373
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:38,347
Are you okay?

374
00:21:38,447 --> 00:21:40,415
Say you're falling
desperately in love with me,

375
00:21:40,515 --> 00:21:41,750
<i>and I'll come back to life.</i>

376
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:44,800
No!

377
00:21:45,070 --> 00:21:47,122
What do you even
mean by love?

378
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:49,057
<i>I'm dying.</i>

379
00:21:49,157 --> 00:21:50,659
You're not dying.

380
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:52,094
Say you desperately
want to kiss me passionately,

381
00:21:52,194 --> 00:21:55,144
<i>and I'll come back to life.</i>

382
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:03,306
I desperately want to
kiss you passionately.

383
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:10,125
A tragedy
narrowly averted.

384
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:13,362
Come here.

385
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:18,233
<i>I knew what was happening
and it was nice</i>

386
00:22:19,571 --> 00:22:22,571
<i>but it wasn't
what I wanted.</i>

387
00:22:24,376 --> 00:22:27,579
<i>Decker:
Yo Kilroy, you big boxing bastard,</i>

388
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,231
<i>get over here.</i>

389
00:22:29,331 --> 00:22:30,599
<i>William:
I remember wining that.</i>

390
00:22:30,699 --> 00:22:32,684
<i>Spring of '79.</i>

391
00:22:32,784 --> 00:22:34,336
Samantha:
I wasn't born yet.

392
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,470
Decker:
Look, I'm not saying you look bad.

393
00:22:35,570 --> 00:22:36,672
I'm just saying -

394
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:38,140
I wish you were
wearing a dress.

395
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,426
I personally find you
more attractive - in a dress.

396
00:22:41,526 --> 00:22:42,811
<i>I'm not saying that to be mean,
but you asked.</i>

397
00:22:42,911 --> 00:22:44,379
<i>And yes, I wish
you were in a dress.</i>

398
00:22:44,479 --> 00:22:46,014
<i>Kim:
I felt like wearing jeans tonight.</i>

399
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:47,382
<i>Decker:
So wear jeans.</i>

400
00:22:47,482 --> 00:22:49,284
<i>Kim: Do you want me
to go home and change?</i>

401
00:22:49,384 --> 00:22:50,852
<i>Decker:
Would I prefer that - yes.</i>

402
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:53,902
<i>Kim:
You are such a shit.</i>

403
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:57,715
<i>I can't believe
you're friends with him.</i>

404
00:22:57,815 --> 00:23:00,095
<i>Hey man,
you went out with her first.</i>

405
00:23:00,195 --> 00:23:03,181
- This is Sarah.
- Hey, good to meet you.

406
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:04,566
Don't judge me
too quickly.

407
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:06,335
My mother killed herself
when I was twelve,

408
00:23:06,435 --> 00:23:10,289
so I have a lot of issues - with women
that I'm still trying to work out.

409
00:23:10,389 --> 00:23:12,140
But I also have
some positive attributes,

410
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,943
unfortunately, none of which -
will be revealed this evening

411
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:16,812
because I am
extremely inebriated.

412
00:23:16,912 --> 00:23:18,113
Alright, man.

413
00:23:18,213 --> 00:23:19,548
Did your mother
really kill herself?

414
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,550
<i>She was exactly
like Sylvia Plath -</i>

415
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:23,318
<i>without
the publishing contract.</i>

416
00:23:23,418 --> 00:23:26,021
I'm trying
to make you laugh.

417
00:23:26,121 --> 00:23:27,189
Man, I got to
show you something.

418
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:28,290
Alright, it's alright.

419
00:23:28,390 --> 00:23:30,425
What the hell
are we all doing?

420
00:23:30,525 --> 00:23:33,612
Why is nobody setting
themselves on fire?

421
00:23:33,712 --> 00:23:37,149
<i>I would set myself
on fire - except you know,</i>

422
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:40,201
<i>I don't think alleged
President George Bush deserves it.</i>

423
00:23:40,301 --> 00:23:42,137
<i>I don't think
he deserves my whole body.</i>

424
00:23:42,237 --> 00:23:44,639
<i>I think he deserves
one singed ball.</i>

425
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:53,648
<i>Male voice:
I was actually there when he died.</i>

426
00:23:53,748 --> 00:23:54,816
<i>Hip chick:
You were there?</i>

427
00:23:54,916 --> 00:23:57,586
<i>Male voice:
Yeah, yeah. I'll never forget it.</i>

428
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,122
Me and my buddy Danny, we had just
come from a baseball game.

429
00:24:00,222 --> 00:24:02,090
We're standing in line
at McDonald's,

430
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,544
<i>a there was this old guy -
like right in line in front of us.</i>

431
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:09,724
<i>This old man - he was
just crying. Just sobbing.</i>

432
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:12,967
I looked over to him,
and I said, "You okay, Mister?"

433
00:24:13,067 --> 00:24:15,771
He looked back at me,
with tears, and he was like,

434
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:19,271
"Didn't you hear?
John Wayne died today. "

435
00:24:20,525 --> 00:24:22,911
<i>- Hip Chick: Yeah?
- John Wayne had died.</i>

436
00:24:23,011 --> 00:24:24,913
<i>It wasn't some numbnut
it was John Wayne!</i>

437
00:24:25,013 --> 00:24:27,963
Well, I'm a vegetarian.

438
00:24:28,366 --> 00:24:31,470
<i>Man: Actually, I was thinking
about being a vegetarian.</i>

439
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:34,055
- I'm Samantha.
- Hi.

440
00:24:34,155 --> 00:24:36,558
So, are you
William's girlfriend?

441
00:24:36,658 --> 00:24:39,633
I guess. I mean,
we're just friends.

442
00:24:40,078 --> 00:24:43,046
<i>Cool. Were are you from?</i>

443
00:24:43,146 --> 00:24:44,299
<i>Your accent
is just so beguiling.</i>

444
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,568
Thank you.

445
00:24:46,668 --> 00:24:48,203
Did you guys
used to go out?

446
00:24:48,303 --> 00:24:50,272
<i>Oh yeah we did;
but it was ages ago.</i>

447
00:24:50,372 --> 00:24:51,440
We're just friends now.

448
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:54,826
<i>So what do you do?
I'm in college, I go to Columbia.</i>

449
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,077
Good.

450
00:24:56,177 --> 00:24:59,079
- I want to be a singer.
- Nice.

451
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:00,482
- Yeah!
- Nice, yeah.

452
00:25:00,582 --> 00:25:03,318
But I guess as far as a job,
I'm babysitting.

453
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,021
Oh, that's great;
like a nanny.

454
00:25:06,121 --> 00:25:07,589
- Hi, hello.
- Hey.

455
00:25:07,689 --> 00:25:08,657
What's up?

456
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:09,858
Good, hi!
How are you?

457
00:25:09,958 --> 00:25:12,160
I'm good - one second!

458
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:14,029
I'm going to take off.

459
00:25:14,129 --> 00:25:15,163
What?

460
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:17,284
Dave is playing
downtown.

461
00:25:17,384 --> 00:25:18,533
So?

462
00:25:18,633 --> 00:25:19,801
I should really go
and see his show.

463
00:25:19,901 --> 00:25:20,969
What, the guy with the teeth?

464
00:25:21,069 --> 00:25:22,537
This could be a job.

465
00:25:22,637 --> 00:25:24,606
That's what
I'm in New York to do.

466
00:25:24,706 --> 00:25:25,807
You don't need me here.

467
00:25:25,907 --> 00:25:27,042
Alright;
well, I'll go with you.

468
00:25:27,142 --> 00:25:28,243
No, no; you stay here
with your friends,

469
00:25:28,343 --> 00:25:29,311
and do your reading.

470
00:25:29,411 --> 00:25:31,313
- No, I'll go with you.
- No, no, no, no; you stay here.

471
00:25:31,413 --> 00:25:33,448
I'll talk to you tomorrow.
No, no, no!

472
00:25:33,548 --> 00:25:36,051
I'll talk to you
tomorrow, okay? Bye.

473
00:25:38,420 --> 00:25:40,789
Fine! Fuck off, then.

474
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:47,209
<i>But the scarecrow's waiting</i>

475
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,980
<i>Must come back
some day</i>

476
00:25:52,751 --> 00:25:55,751
<i>It must come back
come any</i>

477
00:25:56,988 --> 00:25:59,988
<i>To relieve his pain</i>

478
00:26:00,158 --> 00:26:03,158
Hi.

479
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:05,881
Hi.

480
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:08,931
I'm sorry.

481
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,319
What are you sorry about?

482
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:14,369
I didn't like any of that.

483
00:26:15,707 --> 00:26:18,659
Don't tell me to fuck off.

484
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:20,996
Did you ever hear
the one about the guy

485
00:26:21,096 --> 00:26:23,498
who wanted to tell the girl -
how much he liked her,

486
00:26:23,598 --> 00:26:25,100
but all he did
was stammer and say -

487
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:28,430
mean things
when he wanted to be funny?

488
00:26:29,321 --> 00:26:31,673
Did you ever hear
the one about the guy

489
00:26:31,773 --> 00:26:33,508
who brought
the girl to a party -

490
00:26:33,608 --> 00:26:35,810
where it seemed like he'd slept
with every other girl there?

491
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:36,878
Don't kiss me.

492
00:26:36,978 --> 00:26:38,613
Why not?

493
00:26:38,713 --> 00:26:40,382
I don't like to kiss in public.

494
00:26:40,482 --> 00:26:42,817
Well, let's
get out of here then.

495
00:26:42,917 --> 00:26:44,786
I don't want to leave.

496
00:26:44,886 --> 00:26:47,939
Christ, what the fuck
do you want to do?

497
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:50,158
Is this where
it turns abusive?

498
00:26:50,258 --> 00:26:52,243
Goddamn!

499
00:26:59,718 --> 00:27:02,854
Listen, I don't know
what's happening to me.

500
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:05,006
I don't want
to tell you to fuck off.

501
00:27:05,106 --> 00:27:07,342
I don't, but since I met you,

502
00:27:07,442 --> 00:27:09,177
<i>I - can't operate
in the world.</i>

503
00:27:09,277 --> 00:27:11,780
<i>All I think about
is if you like me.</i>

504
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:14,349
<i>And, I know
how lame that sounds.</i>

505
00:27:14,449 --> 00:27:16,551
<i>If you what me
to leave you alone I will.</i>

506
00:27:16,651 --> 00:27:17,886
<i>I really will.</i>

507
00:27:17,986 --> 00:27:19,721
It's just sometimes
you meet somebody -

508
00:27:19,821 --> 00:27:21,256
and you know,
whatever you did before,

509
00:27:21,356 --> 00:27:23,491
nothing could've been
too bad or too wrong -

510
00:27:23,591 --> 00:27:26,546
because it's led you
to this person.

511
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:29,611
And you feel like
that person.

512
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:33,015
<i>Are you that person?</i>

513
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,971
Do you want me to go away?

514
00:27:37,071 --> 00:27:38,073
No.

515
00:27:38,173 --> 00:27:39,441
No, you aren't that person,

516
00:27:39,541 --> 00:27:42,377
or, no, you don't want me
to go away?

517
00:27:42,477 --> 00:27:44,779
Why do you like me so much?

518
00:27:44,879 --> 00:27:47,248
Because you're special.

519
00:27:47,348 --> 00:27:50,051
You're so, so special.

520
00:27:50,151 --> 00:27:53,101
You're such a dumb boy.

521
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:56,758
I know.

522
00:27:56,858 --> 00:27:58,960
Don't worry
any more if I like you.

523
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:01,162
Come on.

524
00:28:01,262 --> 00:28:04,212
<i>Starts out slowly</i>

525
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:08,083
<i>Kissin' finally</i>

526
00:28:09,087 --> 00:28:12,087
<i>You don't see her</i>

527
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:20,529
<i>After a while,
it's all her fantasy</i>

528
00:28:25,904 --> 00:28:28,156
<i>Sleeping in -</i>

529
00:28:28,256 --> 00:28:29,991
<i>Decker:
I bet this is good for you.</i>

530
00:28:30,091 --> 00:28:31,793
<i>You screw
around too much, anyway.</i>

531
00:28:31,893 --> 00:28:34,195
<i>That's probably half of the reason
you're so crazy about her.</i>

532
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:36,031
Remember that you're
not a piece of cake to be with.

533
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:37,832
What's that mean?

534
00:28:37,932 --> 00:28:40,201
Well, you're pretty
skittish, you know.

535
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,604
You just don't come off
as the kind of guy to count on.

536
00:28:42,704 --> 00:28:43,738
<i>Does she get you off
at least?</i>

537
00:28:43,838 --> 00:28:45,940
<i>You know,
take care of business?</i>

538
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,208
<i>A blowjob something?</i>

539
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:48,943
<i>I don't want
any more blowjobs.</i>

540
00:28:49,043 --> 00:28:51,513
You know, some day, I'm going
to remind you of that comment,

541
00:28:51,613 --> 00:28:53,148
and you're going to be
deeply ashamed.

542
00:28:53,248 --> 00:28:54,716
<i>William:
I have to stop seeing this girl.</i>

543
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,685
<i>Decker:
Why?</i>

544
00:28:56,785 --> 00:28:58,353
Because I can't tell you,
man, I'm scared out of my mind.

545
00:28:58,453 --> 00:29:00,321
My hands are shaking
all the time.

546
00:29:00,421 --> 00:29:01,990
Smart girls are tough.

547
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,992
They're a pain in the ass.

548
00:29:04,092 --> 00:29:05,593
There's a difference
between someone who's smart,

549
00:29:05,693 --> 00:29:07,328
and someone
who doesn't like you.

550
00:29:07,428 --> 00:29:08,897
<i>Decker:
I will tell you one thing.</i>

551
00:29:08,997 --> 00:29:10,699
<i>there's a difference
between a smart girl -</i>

552
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,100
<i>and a girl who doesn't
like blowjobs.</i>

553
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,935
<i>William: You know, sometimes, I think
that if I could get her to like me -</i>

554
00:29:14,035 --> 00:29:15,336
then everything
I don't like about myself

555
00:29:15,436 --> 00:29:17,472
would just disappear.

556
00:29:17,572 --> 00:29:19,574
<i>She wants me to go out to
Connecticut to visit her mom.</i>

557
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:22,210
<i>You think I should go?</i>

558
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:23,478
'Course you're going to go.

559
00:29:23,578 --> 00:29:25,146
What do you mean?

560
00:29:25,246 --> 00:29:26,247
Well, you're crazy
about this girl.

561
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:29,297
You've got no options.

562
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:33,235
<i>In a world of trouble</i>

563
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,944
<i>Don't you see</i>

564
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:50,305
<i>Mrs. Garcia:
Father, we thank thee for this food</i>

565
00:29:50,405 --> 00:29:52,207
<i>and all the many blessings.</i>

566
00:29:52,307 --> 00:29:55,927
<i>Bless them to our use,
and us to thy service.</i>

567
00:29:56,027 --> 00:30:00,022
<i>And make us ever mindful
of the needs of others.</i>

568
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:02,350
Amen.

569
00:30:02,450 --> 00:30:05,400
Amen.

570
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:15,641
So, Sarah tells me
you're an actor, is that right?

571
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:18,199
Yeah, I guess.

572
00:30:18,299 --> 00:30:20,802
I hope
you're not too vain.

573
00:30:20,902 --> 00:30:22,070
Mom, you don't know
any actors.

574
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:25,050
Yes, I do.
I've met a few actors -

575
00:30:25,150 --> 00:30:28,089
and they're all
ludicrously vain.

576
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,245
This is really good food.

577
00:30:30,345 --> 00:30:31,946
Yeah Mom,
it's real good.

578
00:30:32,046 --> 00:30:35,531
<i>Mrs. Garcia:
How's everything in New York?</i>

579
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,352
Everything's great.

580
00:30:37,452 --> 00:30:38,553
It's wonderful.

581
00:30:38,653 --> 00:30:41,603
Sarah has big dreams.

582
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:44,225
Did she tell you
she wants to be a singer?

583
00:30:44,325 --> 00:30:47,275
I've actually
seen her sing.

584
00:30:47,412 --> 00:30:49,697
But, did you hear her?

585
00:30:49,797 --> 00:30:52,747
Mom!

586
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,405
Did she tell you
that I worked my whole life

587
00:30:57,505 --> 00:30:58,940
as a secretary -

588
00:30:59,040 --> 00:31:02,185
<i>saving money
for her to go to college?</i>

589
00:31:03,061 --> 00:31:06,831
Did she tell you I was
valedictorian of my high school?

590
00:31:06,931 --> 00:31:08,283
No.

591
00:31:08,383 --> 00:31:09,584
<i>Mrs. Garcia:
But I didn't attend university.</i>

592
00:31:09,684 --> 00:31:12,619
Sarah's father -
didn't deem it important

593
00:31:12,719 --> 00:31:15,704
that either one of us
go to college.

594
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,393
But she loves him.

595
00:31:18,493 --> 00:31:22,148
Don't you, Sarah?
Don't you love your daddy?

596
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:28,220
Well, I suppose she has
told you all about him, right?

597
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,806
We haven't talked much
about stuff like that.

598
00:31:31,906 --> 00:31:34,709
Excuse me.

599
00:31:34,809 --> 00:31:37,759
She's not much
of a talker, is she?

600
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,987
Oh, don't get in
a mood now, Sarah; please.

601
00:31:46,087 --> 00:31:48,022
Sarah, I'm
not being bad, am I?

602
00:31:48,122 --> 00:31:49,424
- No.
- No.

603
00:31:49,524 --> 00:31:52,610
I'm just giving
your young gentleman here -

604
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,770
a little information
about us, right?

605
00:31:56,714 --> 00:32:00,451
<i>Putting your daughter
through college all by yourself -</i>

606
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:02,770
<i>it is something to be
proud of, don't you think?</i>

607
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:05,173
Yes, ma'am.

608
00:32:05,273 --> 00:32:06,307
I love you.

609
00:32:06,407 --> 00:32:09,357
I love her - right?

610
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,312
She's beautiful -
she's a beautiful girl.

611
00:32:11,412 --> 00:32:14,362
Very beautiful.

612
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:17,952
You can't trust love.

613
00:32:18,052 --> 00:32:19,554
William -

614
00:32:19,654 --> 00:32:23,374
let me give you
a little piece of sage advice-

615
00:32:23,474 --> 00:32:25,093
<i>friendship:</i>

616
00:32:25,193 --> 00:32:28,580
<i>true friendship
is all you can trust: you'll see.</i>

617
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,964
<i>Do you know what it is?</i>

618
00:32:30,064 --> 00:32:33,039
I always
believed in being "of use. "

619
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,970
I would ask myself -

620
00:32:36,070 --> 00:32:39,020
"How can I
be of the most use?"

621
00:32:40,692 --> 00:32:45,452
Because William, it is in that way
that God speaks to us.

622
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,933
But Sarah, she doesn't
think about that.

623
00:32:49,033 --> 00:32:50,551
She wants to be special.

624
00:32:50,651 --> 00:32:52,153
Mom, I don't
want to be special.

625
00:32:52,253 --> 00:32:53,922
I like to sing.

626
00:32:54,022 --> 00:32:55,690
The world needs singers,
doesn't it?

627
00:32:55,790 --> 00:32:57,325
- Well -
- No, your mother doesn't.

628
00:32:57,425 --> 00:32:58,760
There you go.

629
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:02,180
Your mother doesn't need
any singers at all.

630
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:06,360
And, excuse me, New York
has more than its share.

631
00:33:06,884 --> 00:33:08,503
Mom, you're drunk.

632
00:33:08,603 --> 00:33:11,578
No, I'm not drunk;
I am your mother.

633
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,999
I have many faults,
the worst of which is not

634
00:33:20,465 --> 00:33:23,465
how painfully
I miss my daughter.

635
00:33:24,635 --> 00:33:27,121
But I'll be able
to stand before God,

636
00:33:27,221 --> 00:33:28,523
and I'm a little worried
about you.

637
00:33:28,623 --> 00:33:31,159
We'll see, Mom. We'll see.

638
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:33,297
What about you, William.

639
00:33:33,397 --> 00:33:36,454
<i>Will you be able
to stand before God?</i>

640
00:33:37,815 --> 00:33:41,385
Well, Mrs. Garcia,
to tell you the truth -

641
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:46,430
it's my opinion
that I have stood before God -

642
00:33:47,558 --> 00:33:50,618
since the moment
I met your daughter.

643
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:55,563
Oh my! Sarah -

644
00:33:57,402 --> 00:34:01,312
We have a bullshit artist
sitting at the table.

645
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:07,488
<i>Mrs. Garcia: Honey, I just
don't what you to get hurt again.</i>

646
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:10,164
<i>Sarah:
I won't.</i>

647
00:34:10,264 --> 00:34:13,664
<i>Mrs. Garcia:
Well - he looks like David.</i>

648
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:16,604
Oh, he does not.

649
00:34:16,704 --> 00:34:18,906
<i>Mrs. Garcia:
He smells like David.</i>

650
00:34:19,006 --> 00:34:21,476
He does not.

651
00:34:21,576 --> 00:34:26,676
<i>Mrs. Garcia: You know,
he smells like something I don't like.</i>

652
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:31,166
I'm done.

653
00:34:38,776 --> 00:34:40,862
Sarah:
You shut her up.

654
00:34:40,962 --> 00:34:42,296
I'm sorry
about that business.

655
00:34:42,396 --> 00:34:43,464
She only does it
when she drinks.

656
00:34:43,564 --> 00:34:44,532
William:
Yeah?

657
00:34:44,632 --> 00:34:46,617
Yeah.

658
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:48,803
Well?

659
00:34:48,903 --> 00:34:51,005
You're doing great.

660
00:34:51,105 --> 00:34:54,055
- I am?
- Yeah!

661
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:56,644
Hey, wait.

662
00:34:56,744 --> 00:34:58,179
What?

663
00:34:58,279 --> 00:35:01,229
Who's David?

664
00:35:03,468 --> 00:35:05,720
No one.

665
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,770
He's your old boyfriend?

666
00:35:09,373 --> 00:35:12,373
Let's not
talk about him, okay?

667
00:35:14,512 --> 00:35:17,512
You know,
some day, Sarah -

668
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:19,767
you're going to
have to talk to me.

669
00:35:23,921 --> 00:35:26,981
What did you mean,
you saw God in me?

670
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:31,279
I don't know.

671
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,114
Can I smoke a cigarette?

672
00:35:33,214 --> 00:35:34,515
<i>Sure.</i>

673
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:40,902
Don't be mad, okay?

674
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,034
David and I went out
for the two and a half years

675
00:35:53,134 --> 00:35:54,635
that I was at college.

676
00:35:54,735 --> 00:35:56,904
<i>We lived together.</i>

677
00:35:57,004 --> 00:35:59,640
<i>After a while he said he couldn't
fall asleep in the same bed with me.</i>

678
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:04,245
<i>I don't know why.
So, I started sleeping on the couch.</i>

679
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:10,765
It's so embarrassing.

680
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,598
One night,
I heard this noise -

681
00:36:15,698 --> 00:36:18,606
so, I walk into our room -

682
00:36:20,645 --> 00:36:23,197
and he had sneaked another girl
up the fire escape -

683
00:36:23,297 --> 00:36:26,442
and was having sex with her
in my bed.

684
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,890
<i>The worst part about it
is that I was so -</i>

685
00:36:33,558 --> 00:36:36,618
I don't know,
like crazy about him -

686
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:39,147
that I didn't break up
with him,

687
00:36:39,247 --> 00:36:42,562
or, I wouldn't let him
break up with me.

688
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:46,587
And then, I dropped out
of college to try to end it.

689
00:36:46,687 --> 00:36:49,637
And - that's why
my mom is so mad.

690
00:36:56,581 --> 00:36:59,581
But the point is -

691
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:05,763
I'm not so tough or interesting
as you seem to think I am.

692
00:37:06,524 --> 00:37:09,524
I'm just more of a dork.

693
00:37:14,332 --> 00:37:17,732
Hey - you should come
to Mexico with me.

694
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:23,224
I'm afraid of that.

695
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:24,926
They've given me
a first class ticket.

696
00:37:25,026 --> 00:37:28,766
I bet I could trade it in
for two coach ones.

697
00:37:29,313 --> 00:37:31,332
I'm afraid to fly.

698
00:37:31,432 --> 00:37:34,382
You're bullshitting me.

699
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:37,518
Come on;
you should come.

700
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:41,709
You have to work.

701
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:44,759
I don't want
to talk anymore.

702
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:50,084
I want to fool around.

703
00:37:50,184 --> 00:37:52,954
Good.

704
00:37:53,054 --> 00:37:54,922
Do you have a condom?

705
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:57,325
No.

706
00:37:57,425 --> 00:37:58,793
Then we can't do it.

707
00:37:58,893 --> 00:38:01,843
Oh God.

708
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:05,366
Do you want
to get me pregnant?

709
00:38:05,466 --> 00:38:08,416
<i>Yes.</i>

710
00:38:08,853 --> 00:38:11,038
Don't say that.

711
00:38:11,138 --> 00:38:12,440
<i>Okay.</i>

712
00:38:18,496 --> 00:38:21,981
Don't you find it odd
when you're a kid -

713
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:23,884
everyone in the whole world

714
00:38:23,984 --> 00:38:26,934
tells you to
follow your dreams -

715
00:38:27,872 --> 00:38:29,090
and when you get older,

716
00:38:29,190 --> 00:38:32,335
they act all offended
if you even try.

717
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,631
I'll go to Mexico with you
if you still want me to.

718
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:55,883
But we'll need to leave
a week early -

719
00:38:55,983 --> 00:38:58,786
<i>and then I'll come back home
before you start work okay?</i>

720
00:38:58,886 --> 00:39:00,921
Okay.

721
00:39:01,021 --> 00:39:03,971
Good night.

722
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:07,342
Good night.

723
00:39:07,611 --> 00:39:11,351
<i>William:
Mexico - is where it all went down.</i>

724
00:39:17,888 --> 00:39:19,373
<i>Sarah:
I think we should have sex.</i>

725
00:39:19,473 --> 00:39:20,675
<i>William:
Right now?</i>

726
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:24,095
Yes. But I have
to ask you some questions first.

727
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:26,914
Okay shoot.

728
00:39:27,014 --> 00:39:28,049
Do you have any diseases?

729
00:39:28,149 --> 00:39:29,383
Nope.

730
00:39:29,483 --> 00:39:30,685
Have you
ever been baptized?

731
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:33,735
<i>No.</i>

732
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:37,338
<i>Do I fail the test?</i>

733
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:41,109
Why are you so scared
to have sex?

734
00:39:47,818 --> 00:39:50,818
I think if we have sex -

735
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:55,923
I'll fall in love with you.

736
00:39:59,697 --> 00:40:02,697
I'm not much of a lover.

737
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:09,937
William -

738
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:18,212
I want to fuck you.

739
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:27,855
Turn off the light.

740
00:40:50,214 --> 00:40:52,066
Sarah:
Stop!

741
00:40:52,166 --> 00:40:53,567
Get a condom on.

742
00:40:53,667 --> 00:40:55,236
There's some in my purse.

743
00:40:55,336 --> 00:40:56,804
William:
Where's your purse?

744
00:40:56,904 --> 00:40:58,472
Sarah:
In the bathroom.

745
00:40:58,572 --> 00:41:01,522
William:
Okay.

746
00:41:31,956 --> 00:41:34,956
Oh Jesus, I'm too nervous.

747
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:38,612
What?

748
00:41:38,712 --> 00:41:41,662
I'm too nervous.

749
00:41:53,444 --> 00:41:56,444
Fuck!

750
00:41:59,083 --> 00:42:00,768
What?

751
00:42:00,868 --> 00:42:03,818
Nothing! Fuck!

752
00:42:04,388 --> 00:42:07,388
Let's just go to sleep,
alright?

753
00:42:12,897 --> 00:42:15,082
What is it?

754
00:42:15,182 --> 00:42:17,985
You don't want to do it?

755
00:42:18,085 --> 00:42:22,420
William: Yeah, I do;
I just can't right now, is all.

756
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:34,048
Why not?

757
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:38,973
Why not?

758
00:42:39,073 --> 00:42:40,875
Look -

759
00:42:40,975 --> 00:42:43,925
Sarah, can we
just go to sleep?

760
00:42:48,966 --> 00:42:51,452
What's wrong?

761
00:42:51,552 --> 00:42:53,621
<i>William:
Can I lift your veil now?</i>

762
00:42:53,721 --> 00:42:56,257
<i>Sarah:
If you will be gentle - Ooh!</i>

763
00:42:56,357 --> 00:42:57,458
<i>William:
What' the matter?</i>

764
00:42:57,558 --> 00:42:59,326
<i>Sarah:
You're not being gentle.</i>

765
00:42:59,426 --> 00:43:01,128
<i>William:
Are you kidding?</i>

766
00:43:01,228 --> 00:43:02,863
<i>Sarah:
No, I don't like it we you're like that.</i>

767
00:43:02,963 --> 00:43:04,198
<i>William:
Like what?</i>

768
00:43:04,298 --> 00:43:06,400
<i>Sarah:
Cynical and sarcastic.</i>

769
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,836
<i>William:
I am sincere.</i>

770
00:43:08,936 --> 00:43:11,886
<i>Sarah:
I am sincere.</i>

771
00:43:17,227 --> 00:43:19,880
Are you wearing protection?

772
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,549
No.

773
00:43:21,649 --> 00:43:24,018
It's alright.
Come on.

774
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:37,865
Cynical and sarcastic!

775
00:43:37,965 --> 00:43:39,700
<i>William:
I am sincere.</i>

776
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:42,820
<i>Sarah: I would believe that you
believe you are, for a while.</i>

777
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:45,005
<i>William:
Everything's for a while.</i>

778
00:43:45,105 --> 00:43:50,035
'For a while' is the stuff
that dreams are made of - baby.

779
00:43:50,327 --> 00:43:52,046
<i>I am sincere.</i>

780
00:43:52,146 --> 00:43:53,547
<i>Sarah:
I am sincere.</i>

781
00:43:53,647 --> 00:43:55,598
<i>William:
I am sincere.</i>

782
00:43:55,698 --> 00:43:56,817
<i>Sarah:
I am sincere.</i>

783
00:43:56,917 --> 00:43:59,186
<i>William:
Take two, okay.</i>

784
00:43:59,286 --> 00:44:00,521
Action.

785
00:44:04,375 --> 00:44:05,559
Can I lift your veil now?

786
00:44:05,659 --> 00:44:07,294
<i>If you will be gentle -
Ooh!</i>

787
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:08,596
What's the matter?

788
00:44:08,696 --> 00:44:10,965
<i>You're not being gentle.</i>

789
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,032
How was I being?

790
00:44:12,132 --> 00:44:13,300
<i>Rough.</i>

791
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,502
<i>- Are you kidding?
- No.</i>

792
00:44:15,602 --> 00:44:16,570
<i>I don't like it
when you're like that.</i>

793
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:17,638
Like what?

794
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:18,839
<i>Cynical and sarcastic.</i>

795
00:44:18,939 --> 00:44:20,541
I am sincere.

796
00:44:20,641 --> 00:44:23,210
<i>I would believe that you
believe you are for a while.</i>

797
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:25,245
Everything's
for a while.

798
00:44:25,345 --> 00:44:28,699
'For a while' is the stuff
that dreams are made of, baby.

799
00:44:28,799 --> 00:44:31,799
I am sincere.

800
00:44:34,138 --> 00:44:37,138
<i>William:
We weren't good tourists.</i>

801
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,994
<i>In our room,
the scent of sex was thick.</i>

802
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,896
<i>I ever wanted
to take a shower again.</i>

803
00:44:42,996 --> 00:44:45,946
<i>My hands
my arms my face -</i>

804
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:48,402
<i>all smelled of Sarah.</i>

805
00:44:48,502 --> 00:44:51,789
<i>We would mess around all day
till it hurt.</i>

806
00:44:51,889 --> 00:44:54,892
<i>It was hard to tell if
she was kissing me or touching me.</i>

807
00:44:54,992 --> 00:44:58,902
<i>Every part of her body
was as wet as her mouth.</i>

808
00:44:59,463 --> 00:45:02,866
<i>Sarah wasn't sexy the way
other people are sexy.</i>

809
00:45:02,966 --> 00:45:07,386
<i>Her body wasn't tight,
or taut or anything like that.</i>

810
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:09,156
<i>She was funny,</i>

811
00:45:09,256 --> 00:45:11,058
<i>the way watching people
fall asleep on busses</i>

812
00:45:11,158 --> 00:45:13,227
<i>with their heads
continually dropping</i>

813
00:45:13,327 --> 00:45:16,277
<i>and then jerking back up,
is funny.</i>

814
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:18,799
<i>She was human -</i>

815
00:45:18,899 --> 00:45:21,863
<i>the most human person
I had ever met</i>

816
00:45:21,963 --> 00:45:23,470
<i>and that was sexy.</i>

817
00:45:23,570 --> 00:45:25,039
Sarah:
Are you awake?

818
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:26,874
William:
Uh huh.

819
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:30,427
Sarah: I remember one afternoon
I came home from school -

820
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:32,713
and my mom told me
my father had left us.

821
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,948
I didn't believe her.

822
00:45:35,048 --> 00:45:37,998
I thought
it was a game -

823
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:41,936
like hide and seek.

824
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:46,107
So I looked
all over the house -

825
00:45:48,212 --> 00:45:51,212
closets -
under beds -

826
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,537
I looked everywhere.

827
00:45:56,637 --> 00:45:59,587
Where'd he go?

828
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:02,609
He went to a
rehabilitation center in Albany,

829
00:46:02,709 --> 00:46:05,659
and never came back.

830
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:07,915
But he wrote me
once a month,

831
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:12,095
from the day he left
'til I went away to college.

832
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:16,995
Once I was away from home,
he'd come visit me.

833
00:46:20,177 --> 00:46:23,832
He just never wanted
to see my mother again.

834
00:46:25,415 --> 00:46:28,168
<i>His letters were my
favorite part of growing up.</i>

835
00:46:28,268 --> 00:46:29,970
<i>They always came
in these dark blue envelopes,</i>

836
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:31,972
<i>and I'd keep them
in a box - underneath my bed.</i>

837
00:46:32,072 --> 00:46:33,741
<i>I loved
that they were blue -</i>

838
00:46:33,841 --> 00:46:36,243
<i>because when he lived with us,
he'd come home -</i>

839
00:46:36,343 --> 00:46:39,293
<i>always wearing
his blue work shirt.</i>

840
00:46:39,563 --> 00:46:41,648
And I'd sit
on the back of the couch,

841
00:46:41,748 --> 00:46:44,151
and I'd scratch his back.

842
00:46:44,251 --> 00:46:48,161
I'd scratch for as long as
my mom would let me.

843
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:50,390
When I went to bed at night,

844
00:46:50,490 --> 00:46:52,593
my fingers
would be stained blue.

845
00:46:52,693 --> 00:46:55,496
<i>And you like that?</i>

846
00:46:55,596 --> 00:46:58,546
Yeah - I did.

847
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:03,617
Do you ever miss
your father?

848
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:06,173
No, never.

849
00:47:12,763 --> 00:47:14,248
Can you see me?

850
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:21,989
Would you like me
to scratch your back?

851
00:47:31,982 --> 00:47:34,868
Stand up,
and go to the bathroom.

852
00:47:34,968 --> 00:47:37,918
Why?

853
00:47:41,458 --> 00:47:44,458
Just do it.

854
00:48:11,421 --> 00:48:13,340
<i>I wanted to tell her
I loved her.</i>

855
00:48:13,440 --> 00:48:14,942
<i>I loved everything
about her.</i>

856
00:48:15,042 --> 00:48:16,510
<i>I loved the way
she made me feel</i>

857
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:18,312
<i>even when
that was miserable.</i>

858
00:48:18,412 --> 00:48:19,780
<i>I loved the way
she bought a dress -</i>

859
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,049
<i>the way she made love
in bathrooms -</i>

860
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,450
<i>the way
she ate chocolate.</i>

861
00:48:23,550 --> 00:48:24,952
<i>I loved her mother -</i>

862
00:48:25,052 --> 00:48:27,020
<i>her drunk
blue-letter writing father.</i>

863
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,070
<i>I loved every thought
she ever had.</i>

864
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,027
<i>Sarah:
Are you okay?</i>

865
00:48:34,127 --> 00:48:36,230
<i>William: I just need to get
some fresh air.</i>

866
00:48:36,330 --> 00:48:38,832
Well, go get us some beer,
maybe some OJ for the morning.

867
00:48:38,932 --> 00:48:41,882
<i>Yeah good.</i>

868
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:53,881
Sarah:
What is it?

869
00:48:53,981 --> 00:48:55,749
I don't know.

870
00:48:55,849 --> 00:49:00,439
I got this weird flash
of nervousness, all of a sudden.

871
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:04,892
I love you.

872
00:49:04,992 --> 00:49:07,942
I love you, too.

873
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:12,299
Go get us some beer, okay.

874
00:49:12,399 --> 00:49:15,349
Okay, I'm on it.

875
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:18,805
Don't forget the OJ!

876
00:49:18,905 --> 00:49:21,824
No problema.

877
00:49:21,924 --> 00:49:24,892
Bye.

878
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:27,214
<i>William:
I ran through the city.</i>

879
00:49:27,314 --> 00:49:29,583
<i>I wasn't looking
for a place to buy beer.</i>

880
00:49:29,683 --> 00:49:31,685
<i>I just ran.</i>

881
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:03,150
- No!
- Yes!

882
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:05,052
You don't understand.

883
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:15,595
You know, you're not supposed
to drink the water down here.

884
00:50:15,695 --> 00:50:17,097
But it's in a bottle.

885
00:50:17,197 --> 00:50:18,799
No, but it's -

886
00:50:18,899 --> 00:50:20,367
No, it's in a bottle.

887
00:50:20,467 --> 00:50:21,702
Alright.

888
00:50:21,802 --> 00:50:23,837

<i>Sarah:
Gracias!</i>

903
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:30,437
What?

904
00:51:30,537 --> 00:51:33,455
Well -

905
00:51:33,555 --> 00:51:35,976
Carmen Maria said
it's possible to get married,

906
00:51:36,076 --> 00:51:38,412
if you really
want to do that.

907
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:41,462
Today?

908
00:51:42,299 --> 00:51:43,784
If you don't want to do it,
it's not a big deal.

909
00:51:43,884 --> 00:51:46,186
No, I didn't say
I didn't want to do it.

910
00:51:46,286 --> 00:51:48,254
I just said, "Today?"

911
00:51:48,354 --> 00:51:50,357
Look, I don't know.

912
00:51:50,457 --> 00:51:53,375
I'm just not sure
if I can be away from you.

913
00:51:53,475 --> 00:51:54,494
And how many times
in a person's life

914
00:51:54,594 --> 00:51:55,629
are you going to fall in love?

915
00:51:55,729 --> 00:51:58,679
I mean -
I'd love to marry you.

916
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:01,668
I figure,
as long as we maintain

917
00:52:01,768 --> 00:52:03,870
a sense of ourselves
as individuals -

918
00:52:03,970 --> 00:52:06,139
and not become some sloppy,
clingy couple

919
00:52:06,239 --> 00:52:07,507
whose lives revolve
around each other -

920
00:52:07,607 --> 00:52:10,444
then, it might be better
if we did get married.

921
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,112
Then, if something goes wrong,
or goes weird -

922
00:52:12,212 --> 00:52:14,448
which, you know,
it most likely will -

923
00:52:14,548 --> 00:52:16,016
we'd have to figure it out,

924
00:52:16,116 --> 00:52:19,176
and one of us
couldn't just run away.

925
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,456
William:
Do you want to have a kid?

926
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:25,358
Sarah:
Yeah. But not right away.

927
00:52:25,458 --> 00:52:27,494
William:
No, not right away, of course not.

928
00:52:27,594 --> 00:52:30,130
So, what do you think?
Am I crazy?

929
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,099
Let's do it.

930
00:52:32,199 --> 00:52:33,200
Really?

931
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:34,835
I want to do it.

932
00:52:34,935 --> 00:52:37,870
I mean,
you have to be sure.

933
00:52:37,970 --> 00:52:39,739
If we do this,
we'll be mentioned

934
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:41,408
in each other's obituaries,
no matter what.

935
00:52:41,508 --> 00:52:43,510
Let's get married.

936
00:52:43,610 --> 00:52:45,745
Let's be individuals,
let's have kids -

937
00:52:45,845 --> 00:52:48,780
- Yeah, but not right away.
- Not right away.

938
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:51,865
But, fuck it, man,
let's do it.

939
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:55,602
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

940
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,226
<i>Sarah:
I don't understand why you say that.</i>

941
00:52:59,326 --> 00:53:01,128
<i>Well because it's my life.</i>

942
00:53:01,228 --> 00:53:03,663
<i>Yes.</i>

943
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:06,713
<i>Mom -</i>

944
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:11,624
<i>I know it's fast
but it's what we wanted Mom.</i>

945
00:53:12,155 --> 00:53:13,206
<i>William?</i>

946
00:53:13,306 --> 00:53:15,842
<i>William, come here.</i>

947
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:18,778
<i>Do you mind
talking to her?</i>

948
00:53:18,878 --> 00:53:21,481
Just talk to her.

949
00:53:21,581 --> 00:53:23,450
Hello, Mrs. Garcia.

950
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:25,285
<i>Mrs. Garcia:
So you what to carry my daughter.</i>

951
00:53:25,385 --> 00:53:26,887
That's right ma'am, I do.

952
00:53:26,987 --> 00:53:28,388
<i>Mrs. Garcia:
Stop calling me ma'am.</i>

953
00:53:28,488 --> 00:53:29,956
<i>You sound insincere.</i>

954
00:53:30,056 --> 00:53:31,358
Fair enough.

955
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:32,425
Mrs. Garcia:
Is she pregnant?

956
00:53:32,525 --> 00:53:34,060
No, she's not pregnant.

957
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,129
<i>Mrs. Garcia:
I didn't have Sarah till I was 30.</i>

958
00:53:36,229 --> 00:53:40,350
<i>That myth about a young mother
having pretty babies isn't true.</i>

959
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:42,410
Yup! I understand.

960
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:44,638
<i>Mrs. Garcia:
Now listen to me very carefully.</i>

961
00:53:44,738 --> 00:53:46,206
Okay.

962
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,041
<i>Mrs. Garcia:
You are a complete idiot.</i>

963
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:51,461
<i>You are both exceedingly -
lacking in intelligence.</i>

964
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:52,913
<i>Am I being clear?</i>

965
00:53:53,013 --> 00:53:55,148
Yes, I think you are.

966
00:53:55,248 --> 00:53:56,983
<i>Mrs. Garcia: Since it doesn't look
like I can do anything</i>

967
00:53:57,083 --> 00:54:00,303
<i>to change your mind -
I only can hope you prove me wrong.</i>

968
00:54:00,403 --> 00:54:01,922
I hope so, too.

969
00:54:02,022 --> 00:54:03,990
<i>Mrs. Garcia:
Now give me back to Sarah.</i>

970
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:06,760
Okay. Bye, Mrs. Garcia.

971
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:09,810
Hi Mom.

972
00:54:14,851 --> 00:54:17,851
Okay.

973
00:54:24,628 --> 00:54:27,414
Yes, I understand.

974
00:54:27,514 --> 00:54:30,464
Okay.

975
00:54:30,700 --> 00:54:32,919
I love you too, Mom.

976
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:34,354
Bye.

977
00:54:34,454 --> 00:54:36,856
Hey, what'd she say?

978
00:54:36,956 --> 00:54:38,758
I can't get married.

979
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:41,808
What'd she say?

980
00:54:41,911 --> 00:54:44,097
She said -

981
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:45,765
that it was a good idea.

982
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:47,667
That you'd be good for me.

983
00:54:47,767 --> 00:54:50,571
That I'll never
make it on my own.

984
00:54:50,671 --> 00:54:54,155
She was actually
very surprised because -

985
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:58,722
she didn't even think
that you liked me that much.

986
00:55:01,931 --> 00:55:05,168
I'm sorry, William,
I was just being ridiculous.

987
00:55:05,268 --> 00:55:06,820
Come here.

988
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:08,154
No, I can't go anywhere.

989
00:55:08,254 --> 00:55:10,056
- Come here.
- I'm not going to get married.

990
00:55:10,156 --> 00:55:12,726
I know. Two seconds.

991
00:55:12,826 --> 00:55:14,628
Just follow me;
come on.

992
00:55:14,728 --> 00:55:16,396
Sarah:
Where are we going?

993
00:55:16,496 --> 00:55:17,897
Where are we going?

994
00:55:17,997 --> 00:55:20,133
William:
You'll see.

995
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:22,802
Come on!

996
00:55:22,902 --> 00:55:23,970
Come on!

997
00:55:24,070 --> 00:55:25,872
Sarah:
I'm going.

998
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,559
Promise me -

999
00:56:28,659 --> 00:56:31,037
if something goes wrong -

1000
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:34,087
if I run away -

1001
00:56:34,457 --> 00:56:37,310
you'll find me
and make me kiss you.

1002
00:56:37,410 --> 00:56:39,279
Nothing will go wrong.

1003
00:56:39,379 --> 00:56:41,915
Just promise.

1004
00:56:42,015 --> 00:56:43,883
I promise.

1005
00:58:09,452 --> 00:58:12,338
Thanks.

1006
00:58:12,438 --> 00:58:14,774
Scene 66 take one.

1007
00:58:14,874 --> 00:58:17,143
<i>And took my hand</i>

1008
00:58:17,243 --> 00:58:20,193
<i>And you said
there is no question</i>

1009
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:24,664
<i>And you kindly sent me</i>

1010
00:58:25,468 --> 00:58:27,187
<i>I knew then</i>

1011
00:58:27,287 --> 00:58:28,755
<i>William:

00:58:30,890 --> 00:58:31,858
<i>William:
Yeah, she's really good.</i>

1014
00:58:31,958 --> 00:58:33,326
<i>Guitar player:
Is she hot?</i>

1015
00:58:33,426 --> 00:58:36,376
<i>William:
Yeah she's real hot.</i>

1016
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:39,199
<i>You know what
it is you miss most</i>

1017
00:58:39,299 --> 00:58:41,167
when you're separated

00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:44,003
you lived with and loved?

1019
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:47,090
<i>It's waking
with that warmness beside you.</i>

1020
00:58:47,190 --> 00:58:49,275
<i>Once you get used to
that warmness -</i>

1021
00:58:49,375 --> 00:58:53,263
<i>it's a hell of a lonely feeling
to wake up without it.</i>

1022
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:56,363
Specially in some dollar -

1023
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,485
Can we do it
from the top?

1024
00:58:58,585 --> 00:59:00,320
<i>Director:

<i>A hot water bottle won't do,

1034

00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:39,242
<i>I spent more than half
the money I made on that movie</i>

1039
00:59:39,342 --> 00:59:41,227
<i>on phone calls -
to New York,</i>

1040
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:43,296
<i>and on a last minute
plane ticket.</i>

1041
00:59:43,396 --> 00:59:45,923
<i>I changed my flight
a lost $700</i>

1042
00:59:46,023 --> 00:59:48,535
<i>so I could arrive
three and a half hours earlier.</i>

1043
00:59:48,635 --> 00:59:50,937
<i>No shit,
I really did that.</i>

1044
00:59:51,037 --> 00:59:53,987
<i>I would never see you go</i>

1045
01:00:07,870 --> 01:00:10,056
<i>William:
Hey, how're you doing?</i>

1046
01:00:10,156 --> 01:00:12,625
<i>I came home early;
I wanted to surprise you.</i>

1047
01:00:12,725 --> 01:00:15,675
<i>Sarah:
You did.</i>

1048
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:19,681
<i>William:
I thought it'd be fun.</i>

1049
01:00:19,781 --> 01:00:21,887
<i>Sarah:
I'm eating oatmeal.</i>

1050
01:00:21,987 --> 01:00:24,918
<i>William:
Yeah I can see. How is it?</i>

1051
01:00:25,221 --> 01:00:28,007
<i>Sarah:
It's pretty good.</i>

1052
01:00:28,107 --> 01:00:30,176
I got you these.

1053
01:00:30,276 --> 01:00:31,945
Thank you.

1054
01:00:32,045 --> 01:00:35,020
<i>I brought you that towel
you wanted.</i>

1055
01:00:36,399 --> 01:00:38,359
Thanks.

1056
01:00:38,459 --> 01:00:40,019
And, here's a present.

1057
01:00:40,119 --> 01:00:42,555
It's a green dress.

1058
01:00:42,655 --> 01:00:44,557
I saw it on a mannequin,
and it reminded me -

1059
01:00:44,657 --> 01:00:46,993
of that one you always wear,
so I bought it.

1060
01:00:47,093 --> 01:00:48,695
I don't know
if that's lame or not,

1061
01:00:48,795 --> 01:00:50,163
buying something -

1062
01:00:50,263 --> 01:00:52,365
for somebody that you know
they already have,

1063
01:00:52,465 --> 01:00:55,415
but - it made sense
at the time.

1064
01:00:56,953 --> 01:00:58,237
<i>Thank you.</i>

1065
01:00:58,337 --> 01:01:00,974
No problem.

1066
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:04,227
Do you want to put these flowers
in some water or something?

1067
01:01:04,327 --> 01:01:07,327
Sure.

1068
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:11,331
Are you nervous?

1069
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:13,853
Yes.

1070
01:01:13,953 --> 01:01:16,903
About seeing me?

1071
01:01:17,907 --> 01:01:20,907
You look different.

1072
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:24,530
You told me you weren't
coming home until tonight.

1073
01:01:24,630 --> 01:01:27,500
I took a different flight.

1074
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:30,550
Why?

1075
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,842
Hey, I heard a joke;
you want to hear it?

1076
01:01:35,942 --> 01:01:37,343
Sure.

1077
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:39,679
Okay, there's these two monks.

1078
01:01:39,779 --> 01:01:41,280
A monsignor guy -

1079
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:43,883
and a regular monk guy,
and they're fishing.

1080
01:01:43,983 --> 01:01:45,084
<i>And the regular monk -</i>

1081
01:01:45,184 --> 01:01:46,686
<i>catches
this humongous fish.</i>

1082
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:47,987
He goes -

1083
01:01:48,087 --> 01:01:50,056
"Wow, that is one heck
of a sonofabitch, "

1084
01:01:50,156 --> 01:01:51,591
and the monsignor guy says -

1085
01:01:51,691 --> 01:01:53,559
"My son,
watch your language, "

1086
01:01:53,659 --> 01:01:56,029
and the other one says -"No,
Father, I'm sorry,

1087
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:58,364
but that's the name
of the fish, 'sonofabitch'."

1088
01:01:58,464 --> 01:02:00,199
"Oh, " goes the monsignor.

1089
01:02:00,299 --> 01:02:02,502
<i>So that night they're
initiating some new monk,</i>

1090
01:02:02,602 --> 01:02:04,504
<i>and they decided
to serve the fish.</i>

1091
01:02:04,604 --> 01:02:06,105
<i>They all sat down
eating this fish</i>

1092
01:02:06,205 --> 01:02:07,707
<i>and the regular monk goes -</i>

1093
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:10,143
"Boy, this sonofabitch
is really good. "

1094
01:02:10,243 --> 01:02:11,711
And the monsignor guy says -

1095
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:14,080
"Yeah, I've never had
sonofabitch this good. "

1096
01:02:14,180 --> 01:02:15,715
And he turns to
the new recruit and says -

1097
01:02:15,815 --> 01:02:17,183
"How do you like the fish?"

1098
01:02:17,283 --> 01:02:18,284
And the new guy says -

1099
01:02:18,384 --> 01:02:20,420
"Hey,
I'm not much for fish -

1100
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:25,450
but I'm sure going to enjoy
working with you fuckin' guys. "

1101
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,765
I have to go
to the bathroom.

1102
01:02:32,865 --> 01:02:35,815
How're you doing?

1103
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:39,085
I just woke up.

1104
01:02:51,501 --> 01:02:54,501
I still need to go
to the bathroom.

1105
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:03,877
<i>Listen, I've seen
all this before</i>

1106
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:12,886
<i>Last time I walked
through the door</i>

1107
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:21,294
<i>Why must it be today</i>

1108
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:29,035
<i>Why have I
known it on my way?</i>

1109
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:37,210
<i>You are lovely
all the time</i>

1110
01:03:41,951 --> 01:03:45,011
<i>Now you've gone
and changed your mind</i>

1111
01:03:50,359 --> 01:03:53,419
<i>If there's something
that won't stray</i>

1112
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:01,401
<i>In the change from
night to day</i>

1113
01:04:05,007 --> 01:04:07,360
<i>Sarah:
Are you sure you can come?</i>

1114
01:04:07,460 --> 01:04:09,195
<i>William:
Yeah, it's no problem.</i>

1115
01:04:09,295 --> 01:04:10,696
<i>Sarah:
We'll only be gone for a couple of days.</i>

1116
01:04:10,796 --> 01:04:12,465
<i>And - I'm kind of worried
with the two shows -</i>

1117
01:04:12,565 --> 01:04:15,134
<i>we're playing,
I might be kind of busy.</i>

1118
01:04:15,234 --> 01:04:18,755
Maybe it's a better idea
if I didn't come then.

1119
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,273
Are you sure?

1120
01:04:20,373 --> 01:04:21,908
<i>Yeah.</i>

1121
01:04:22,008 --> 01:04:23,509
<i>It seems like you need
a little space.</i>

1122
01:04:23,609 --> 01:04:25,444
<i>And I got some things
I could probably take are of.</i>

1123
01:04:25,544 --> 01:04:28,494
Okay!
I think you're right.

1124
01:04:29,031 --> 01:04:31,884
What do you mean?

1125
01:04:31,984 --> 01:04:33,820
Well -

1126
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:36,122
you just said you have some things
to take care of, right?

1127
01:04:36,222 --> 01:04:39,490
Yeah, but you know
that's a fuckin' lie.

1128
01:04:39,590 --> 01:04:40,960
<i>All I do
is go to the movies.</i>

1129
01:04:41,060 --> 01:04:42,361
<i>I've been to -</i>

1130
01:04:42,461 --> 01:04:45,411
thirteen movies
in three days.

1131
01:04:46,315 --> 01:04:49,715
I mean, you don't
want me to come, right?

1132
01:04:50,853 --> 01:04:53,853
I don't know,
I mean -

1133
01:04:54,323 --> 01:04:56,375
I don't know. It's just -

1134
01:04:56,475 --> 01:04:57,677
you don't
seem to do anything

1135
01:04:57,777 --> 01:04:59,879
except sit around
and wait for me.

1136
01:04:59,979 --> 01:05:02,281
<i>You know that's not
the couple we wanted to be.</i>

1137
01:05:02,381 --> 01:05:04,050
I do?

1138
01:05:04,150 --> 01:05:07,019
<i>Look -
while you were gone,</i>

1139
01:05:07,119 --> 01:05:09,755
I mean, I don't want to belittle
the time we spent in Mexico -

1140
01:05:09,855 --> 01:05:12,358
but it wasn't
very realistic.

1141
01:05:12,458 --> 01:05:13,659
<i>And all I did
while you were away,</i>

1142
01:05:13,759 --> 01:05:15,795
<i>was sit around
a wait for you -</i>

1143
01:05:15,895 --> 01:05:16,896
<i>and think about you.</i>

1144
01:05:16,996 --> 01:05:19,946
And, I can't do that.

1145
01:05:20,149 --> 01:05:22,835
I've done that before,
and I know that sounds -

1146
01:05:22,935 --> 01:05:24,570
<i>Sometimes,
you take that away.</i>

1147
01:05:24,670 --> 01:05:27,039
I take that away?

1148
01:05:27,139 --> 01:05:28,841
Take what away?

1149
01:05:28,941 --> 01:05:31,210
I came to New York
to be on my own.

1150
01:05:31,310 --> 01:05:34,730
I'm just happy that I was able
to feel the way you made me feel.

1151
01:05:34,830 --> 01:05:37,830
I didn't think
it was possible.

1152
01:05:38,401 --> 01:05:41,886
Good; you look like
you're feeling better.

1153
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:49,342
So, what's going on here?

1154
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:54,180
Are you breaking
up with me?

1155
01:05:56,485 --> 01:05:59,038
I just think that we need
a little more space.

1156
01:05:59,138 --> 01:06:01,607
Space?

1157
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:05,261
Can't you think of something
a little more original than that?

1158
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:07,179
I'm just trying
to be honest.

1159
01:06:07,279 --> 01:06:09,982
Well, then, you're
a pretty boring person if like -

1160
01:06:10,082 --> 01:06:15,012
<i>catch-phrases from break-up 101
are your idea of the truth.</i>

1161
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,361
I like you so much.

1162
01:06:22,461 --> 01:06:24,830
Oh great. You like me!

1163
01:06:24,930 --> 01:06:28,840
So I don't have to
feel bad then. That's super.

1164
01:06:30,119 --> 01:06:32,095
I'm a sweet guy -

1165
01:06:32,195 --> 01:06:34,907
a fun fellow to have
Margaritas and -

1166
01:06:35,007 --> 01:06:37,957
hang with
for a week or so but -

1167
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:42,237
not somebody to see
like on a day-to-day basis.

1168
01:06:46,302 --> 01:06:49,302
Why are you doing this?

1169
01:06:50,573 --> 01:06:53,573
William -
you're going to be fine.

1170
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:58,845
Oh fuck you!

1171
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:02,581
You're a spoiled,
selfish - cold coward.

1172
01:07:05,221 --> 01:07:06,372
I've told people
to fuck off,

1173
01:07:06,472 --> 01:07:09,259
and I know
how important you feel.

1174
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:12,428
I've been you,
and I know that you suck!

1175
01:07:35,151 --> 01:07:37,103
Guys, can I
borrow the cone?

1176
01:07:37,203 --> 01:07:38,871
<i>The morning
Sarah returned from Boston,</i>

1177
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:40,940
<i>I was singing
a different tune.</i>

1178
01:07:41,040 --> 01:07:43,990
<i>It went something like,
I'm sorry.</i>

1179
01:07:44,427 --> 01:07:47,113
Rise and shine,
sleepyhead.

1180
01:07:47,213 --> 01:07:51,973
Or, I'm going to huff and puff,
and blow your house down.

1181
01:07:56,872 --> 01:07:59,872
<i>Sarah:
Stop.</i>

1182
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:05,645
Thanks a lot, guys.

1183
01:08:15,357 --> 01:08:17,610
Oh, come on.
How do you like my outfit?

1184
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:18,978
It's my
"I'm sorry" outfit.

1185
01:08:19,078 --> 01:08:20,146
Look, I have to go to work.

1186
01:08:20,246 --> 01:08:22,681
I know;
can I walk with you?

1187
01:08:22,781 --> 01:08:24,383
<i>Are you Native American?</i>

1188
01:08:24,483 --> 01:08:25,551
<i>Sarah:
What?</i>

1189
01:08:25,651 --> 01:08:26,619
<i>William:
Nothing.</i>

1190
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:28,654
Okay, so here's the deal.
I'm going to do the talking, alright?

1191
01:08:28,754 --> 01:08:30,122
Because I have
some things to say -

1192
01:08:30,222 --> 01:08:33,092
and because you don't look
particularly talkative.

1193
01:08:33,192 --> 01:08:35,294
Not that you don't
look good - because you do,

1194
01:08:35,394 --> 01:08:38,381
that's why I asked the thing
about being Native American.

1195
01:08:38,481 --> 01:08:40,199
Anyway,
I'll start the talking,

1196
01:08:40,299 --> 01:08:42,368
and if you want to jump in,
just say -

1197
01:08:42,468 --> 01:08:43,769
"Hey, I got something
to say. "

1198
01:08:43,869 --> 01:08:45,438
And five'll get you ten
that I'll say -

1199
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:47,522
"Go right ahead. "

1200
01:08:47,622 --> 01:08:50,109
Okay, I know
what you're thinking,

1201
01:08:50,209 --> 01:08:51,977
"God, this guy
is such a creep.

1202
01:08:52,077 --> 01:08:54,547
Two days ago, he says
all kinds of nasty things,

1203
01:08:54,647 --> 01:08:56,115
and leaves my apartment
in a huff -

1204
01:08:56,215 --> 01:08:57,883
and now,
he wakes me up in a tuxedo,

1205
01:08:57,983 --> 01:08:59,185
howling at my window -

1206
01:08:59,285 --> 01:09:01,420
and expects me to think
it's funny. "

1207
01:09:01,520 --> 01:09:05,541
Well, let me tell you, missy,
you are absolutely right.

1208
01:09:05,641 --> 01:09:08,641
I don't even like myself.

1209
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:12,131
So what?
The suit gets no comment?

1210
01:09:12,231 --> 01:09:13,566
"Why are you
wearing that?"

1211
01:09:13,666 --> 01:09:15,167
"Oh, you're so zany. "

1212
01:09:15,267 --> 01:09:18,287
Or maybe, "I can't believe
you're such a cuckoo-head. "

1213
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:19,972
Nothing, huh?

1214
01:09:20,072 --> 01:09:21,574
You're just going
to keep walking.

1215
01:09:21,674 --> 01:09:24,624
Okay, that's cool.

1216
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:27,079
You want to know
why I wore it?

1217
01:09:27,179 --> 01:09:29,915
An attempt to make movies
more realistic.

1218
01:09:30,015 --> 01:09:32,965
I like to embrace the cliche.

1219
01:09:34,336 --> 01:09:37,336
Hey, this is 'A' material.

1220
01:09:38,073 --> 01:09:39,692
Okay, I'm sorry.

1221
01:09:39,792 --> 01:09:40,993
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1222
01:09:41,093 --> 01:09:42,795
I fucked up.

1223
01:09:42,895 --> 01:09:44,330
I got upset.

1224
01:09:44,430 --> 01:09:45,931
You just switched gears
on me, you know.

1225
01:09:46,031 --> 01:09:47,999
You got to admit that.

1226
01:09:48,099 --> 01:09:50,069
Look, I know you're getting
a little scared

1227
01:09:50,169 --> 01:09:53,722
that maybe we went too far,
too fast - and that's cool.

1228
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:57,426
It's just you got to give me
a minute to get the idea, you know?

1229
01:09:57,526 --> 01:09:59,278
I don't know
how to love you right.

1230
01:09:59,378 --> 01:10:01,447
You got to let me know.

1231
01:10:01,547 --> 01:10:04,416
See, this is the way I see it,
if the attempt is all -

1232
01:10:04,516 --> 01:10:05,951
then I can promise you
everything.

1233
01:10:06,051 --> 01:10:09,001
Look, I don't want
a boyfriend.

1234
01:10:13,576 --> 01:10:16,576
<i>I own the corner</i>

1235
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:23,382
<i>You look so pale</i>

1236
01:10:26,155 --> 01:10:27,606
<i>William:
Hey, it's me.</i>

1237
01:10:27,706 --> 01:10:29,909
<i>Sorry for calling
so late but -</i>

1238
01:10:30,009 --> 01:10:31,177
<i>I thought
maybe if you wanted,</i>

1239
01:10:31,277 --> 01:10:34,227
<i>we could go
get a cup of coffee.</i>

1240
01:10:34,697 --> 01:10:36,673
<i>Sarah:
Yeah.</i>

1241
01:10:36,773 --> 01:10:38,939
<i>No, I think I'm too tired.</i>

1242
01:10:39,039 --> 01:10:40,286
It is late.

1243
01:10:40,386 --> 01:10:43,336
<i>Sarah:
Yeah, I should go to bed.</i>

1244
01:10:43,772 --> 01:10:46,659
<i>William:
How you been?</i>

1245
01:10:46,759 --> 01:10:48,060
<i>Sarah:
Fine.</i>

1246
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:50,129
<i>William:
What have you been doing?</i>

1247
01:10:50,229 --> 01:10:53,164
<i>Sarah:
Where are you?</i>

1248
01:10:53,264 --> 01:10:55,367
<i>William:
I'm in The Village.</i>

1249
01:10:55,467 --> 01:10:58,417
<i>Sarah:
Oh.</i>

1250
01:10:58,587 --> 01:11:01,987
Are you going to
be singing anytime soon?

1251
01:11:03,259 --> 01:11:04,343
<i>Sarah:
No.</i>

1252
01:11:04,443 --> 01:11:06,745
<i>Listen, I should go to bed.</i>

1253
01:11:06,845 --> 01:11:07,813
<i>William:
Yeah, of course.</i>

1254
01:11:07,913 --> 01:11:09,848
I'll talk to you later, then.

1255
01:11:09,948 --> 01:11:11,283
<i>Sarah:
Sleep well.</i>

1256
01:11:11,383 --> 01:11:13,485
Okay, yeah, you too.

1257
01:11:13,585 --> 01:11:15,254
<i>Sarah:
Goodbye William.</i>

1258
01:11:15,354 --> 01:11:17,590
Bye.

1259
01:11:17,690 --> 01:11:20,326
<i>William: I held onto the phone
like it was a piece of her.</i>

1260
01:11:20,426 --> 01:11:23,579
<i>Everything was
disintegrating so quickly.</i>

1261
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:26,664
<i>I knew I was the dopey guy
standing out in the cold,</i>

1262
01:11:26,764 --> 01:11:28,734
<i>staring up
at a warm window.</i>

1263
01:11:28,834 --> 01:11:30,302
<i>Hell, I wished
it would rain.</i>

1264
01:11:30,402 --> 01:11:32,605
<i>It's just so hard
to miss someone</i>

1265
01:11:32,705 --> 01:11:35,655
<i>who only lives
eight blocks away.</i>

1266
01:11:36,091 --> 01:11:37,376
<i>Jesse:
At a certain point, William,</i>

1267
01:11:37,476 --> 01:11:39,144
<i>your father not calling you
on your birthday,</i>

1268
01:11:39,244 --> 01:11:40,980
<i>becomes your problem,
not his.</i>

1269
01:11:41,080 --> 01:11:43,282
I didn't expect him to call.

1270
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:45,484
<i>He loves you very much,
I'm sure of this.</i>

1271
01:11:45,584 --> 01:11:47,686
Why are we
talking about him?

1272
01:11:47,786 --> 01:11:50,973
<i>I just think
it's too painful for him -</i>

1273
01:11:51,073 --> 01:11:52,925
<i>to remain
in contact with you.</i>

1274
01:11:53,025 --> 01:11:54,693
Why are you giving this to me?

1275
01:11:54,793 --> 01:11:57,296
Who brought him up?

1276
01:11:57,396 --> 01:12:00,346
I'm sorry.

1277
01:12:00,916 --> 01:12:03,402
<i>Why do you think
she doesn't like me?</i>

1278
01:12:03,502 --> 01:12:05,237
Who?

1279
01:12:05,337 --> 01:12:06,772
What, that girl?

1280
01:12:06,872 --> 01:12:08,307
Because there's something
wrong with her.

1281
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:09,475
<i>No, Mom.</i>

1282
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:11,677
There's something
wrong with me.

1283
01:12:11,777 --> 01:12:13,512
What do you think it is?

1284
01:12:13,612 --> 01:12:16,248
<i>You respect people more
when they don't respect you.</i>

1285
01:12:16,348 --> 01:12:18,984
That, and you didn't
go to college.

1286
01:12:19,084 --> 01:12:22,034
Those are your
only two flaws.

1287
01:12:24,673 --> 01:12:28,243
Do you want to hear
about my new boyfriend?

1288
01:12:29,144 --> 01:12:31,196
<i>I suppose
that doesn't interest you.</i>

1289
01:12:31,296 --> 01:12:34,066
He's very funny.

1290
01:12:34,166 --> 01:12:37,116
His name is Harris.

1291
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:38,637
I think you'll be astonished

1292
01:12:38,737 --> 01:12:41,687
at how many times
you fall in love.

1293
01:12:43,258 --> 01:12:46,045
I just -

1294
01:12:46,145 --> 01:12:48,914
I just don't seem to have -

1295
01:12:49,014 --> 01:12:51,964
the first idea
about how men -

1296
01:12:52,301 --> 01:12:53,319
are supposed to behave.

1297
01:12:53,419 --> 01:12:55,120
It seems like
I don't have -

1298
01:12:55,220 --> 01:12:58,507
certain qualities
that I should, you know?

1299
01:12:58,607 --> 01:13:01,126
I mean, I'm sure
most men don't sit around

1300
01:13:01,226 --> 01:13:04,371
getting all chatty -
with their moms.

1301
01:13:04,847 --> 01:13:06,432
You know what I'm saying?

1302
01:13:06,532 --> 01:13:08,767
What are other men like?

1303
01:13:08,867 --> 01:13:11,817
Are they like me?

1304
01:13:12,621 --> 01:13:15,621
I don't know.

1305
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:19,158
Hey, how come
I'm not baptized?

1306
01:13:19,762 --> 01:13:21,180
<i>I mean weren't you
the least bit -</i>

1307
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:24,255
<i>concerned with
the state of my soul?</i>

1308
01:13:25,167 --> 01:13:27,853
Listen, William,
there was nothing

1309
01:13:27,953 --> 01:13:30,122
anybody at Fort Worth
First Methodist could do,

1310
01:13:30,222 --> 01:13:31,890
for the state of your soul.

1311
01:13:31,990 --> 01:13:33,826
<i>Oh, forget it;
it's not important.</i>

1312
01:13:33,926 --> 01:13:36,876
Look, listen to me.

1313
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,750
You've been ignoring me
since you were fifteen,

1314
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:45,354
and I was thinking that
a good birthday resolution

1315
01:13:45,454 --> 01:13:49,525
might be to change your attitude
about your poor old Ma.

1316
01:13:49,625 --> 01:13:52,625
Don't be so moody.

1317
01:13:53,429 --> 01:13:56,281
A lot of bad shit
is going to happen to you.

1318
01:13:56,381 --> 01:13:58,183
People are not
going to love you back.

1319
01:13:58,283 --> 01:13:59,985
<i>And if you're serious
about becoming an artist</i>

1320
01:14:00,085 --> 01:14:01,820
<i>that's the first thing
you should learn.</i>

1321
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,390
<i>And listen -
you're going to die, okay?</i>

1322
01:14:04,490 --> 01:14:06,892
Relatively soon, okay?

1323
01:14:06,992 --> 01:14:09,894
So, that being said,
you have nothing to worry about.

1324
01:14:09,994 --> 01:14:12,959
No matter what happens
in this life,

1325
01:14:13,059 --> 01:14:16,000
you have two options -
only two options.

1326
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:19,415
You can handle things well
and be happy,

1327
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:21,440
or, you can handle
them poorly and be miserable.

1328
01:14:21,540 --> 01:14:24,475
It's up to you.

1329
01:14:24,575 --> 01:14:27,560
Look William,
I'm disappointed.

1330
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:30,349
I didn't escape Fort Worth

1331
01:14:30,449 --> 01:14:32,951
to sell college text books
in Trenton, New Jersey.

1332
01:14:33,051 --> 01:14:35,254
That was not my goal.

1333
01:14:35,354 --> 01:14:37,689
I thought my life
was going to be

1334
01:14:37,789 --> 01:14:39,992
so much more interesting
than it's turned out,

1335
01:14:40,092 --> 01:14:43,407
but what am I going to
do about it, huh?

1336
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:49,912
The root of depression
is being too self-involved,

1337
01:14:50,052 --> 01:14:53,052
and the cure -
is to read - okay.

1338
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:58,510
So, read some books.

1339
01:14:58,610 --> 01:15:02,180
Don't take yourself
so seriously. Exercise.

1340
01:15:02,331 --> 01:15:04,583
Take that gorgeous,
sexy body outside and move it.

1341
01:15:04,683 --> 01:15:07,633
Here, and
open your present.

1342
01:15:20,182 --> 01:15:23,837
<i>You got to lose
those cowboy boots, William.</i>

1343
01:15:24,052 --> 01:15:25,871
<i>I worked too hard
to get us out of Texas</i>

1344
01:15:25,971 --> 01:15:29,031
for you to go around
in those things.

1345
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:33,058
<i>The long night is coming</i>

1346
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:40,165
<i>I hear the way</i>

1347
01:15:43,739 --> 01:15:46,739
<i>I feel the crying moment</i>

1348
01:15:49,578 --> 01:15:52,578
<i>But oh, baby -</i>

1349
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:57,729
<i>Phone machine:
Please leave a message after tone.</i>

1350
01:15:57,953 --> 01:16:00,038
<i>Sarah:
Hi William, Happy Birthday.</i>

1351
01:16:00,138 --> 01:16:03,225
<i>I know your birthday is today
and I have some presents.</i>

1352
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:05,511
<i>Today has been
a really bad day for me.</i>

1353
01:16:05,611 --> 01:16:07,212
<i>If you have some time,</i>

1354
01:16:07,312 --> 01:16:10,332
<i>maybe you could come by
tonight or tomorrow or -</i>

1355
01:16:10,432 --> 01:16:13,400
<i>William:
Hi. Yeah, that'd be great.</i>

1356
01:16:13,500 --> 01:16:16,560
<i>No, I can come by
right now actually.</i>

1357
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:23,762
- Hi.
- Hey.

1358
01:16:23,862 --> 01:16:26,231
Oh - close your eyes.

1359
01:16:26,331 --> 01:16:29,281
I have to finish wrapping.

1360
01:16:31,486 --> 01:16:33,071
Can I open my eyes now?

1361
01:16:33,171 --> 01:16:36,121
<i>Yeah.</i>

1362
01:16:39,795 --> 01:16:42,080
<i>So, you want a beer?</i>

1363
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:45,130
Sure.

1364
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:50,789
<i>You can put on some music,
if you like.</i>

1365
01:16:50,889 --> 01:16:53,839
Okay.

1366
01:17:00,515 --> 01:17:02,475
<i>How was your day?</i>

1367
01:17:02,575 --> 01:17:05,037
Oh fine.

1368
01:17:05,137 --> 01:17:06,805
How was your day?

1369
01:17:06,905 --> 01:17:10,390
<i>Crazy. I've been
ridiculously busy lately.</i>

1370
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:14,293
Yeah?

1371
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:16,114
So, what are these?

1372
01:17:16,214 --> 01:17:19,116
Presents.

1373
01:17:19,216 --> 01:17:22,518
Okay - I guess I should
open them, huh?

1374
01:17:22,618 --> 01:17:25,604
Yeah.

1375
01:17:29,811 --> 01:17:31,396
They're for candles.

1376
01:17:31,496 --> 01:17:32,831
Cool.

1377
01:17:32,931 --> 01:17:35,881
Look at this.

1378
01:17:40,422 --> 01:17:43,422
- You did this?
- Yeah.

1379
01:17:45,093 --> 01:17:48,093
Wow!

1380
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:56,154
Why did you
give this to me?

1381
01:17:56,254 --> 01:17:57,856
I thought
you'd like it.

1382
01:17:57,956 --> 01:17:59,924
- I do.
- Good.

1383
01:18:00,024 --> 01:18:02,941
It's beautiful.

1384
01:18:10,585 --> 01:18:13,585
Do you want to
keep seeing me?

1385
01:18:18,460 --> 01:18:20,679
I don't think that now
is the right time.

1386
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:22,781
Then, why did you
give it to me?

1387
01:18:22,881 --> 01:18:24,716
What do you mean?

1388
01:18:24,816 --> 01:18:27,751
What am I supposed to do with it?
Hang it on my wall?

1389
01:18:27,851 --> 01:18:30,188
I don't know,
I thought you just -

1390
01:18:30,288 --> 01:18:31,857
You think I want to
hang a picture on my wall

1391
01:18:31,957 --> 01:18:36,078
to remind me of a girl who
doesn't want to see me anymore?

1392
01:18:36,178 --> 01:18:40,148
Look, I warned you that
I didn't think I could do this.

1393
01:18:40,248 --> 01:18:41,900
Yeah.

1394
01:18:42,000 --> 01:18:46,335
You also made me promise -
to force you to kiss me.

1395
01:18:46,688 --> 01:18:48,907
You can't do that.

1396
01:18:49,007 --> 01:18:51,043
I came to New York
to be on my own -

1397
01:18:51,143 --> 01:18:52,911
Oh, yeah, yeah;
I know the story.

1398
01:18:53,011 --> 01:18:54,446
I'm just
trying to be honest.

1399
01:18:54,546 --> 01:18:56,014
<i>Well, I wish
you'd lie a little it.</i>

1400
01:18:56,114 --> 01:18:57,315
Oh, you want me to lie?

1401
01:18:57,415 --> 01:18:59,217
No, I want you
to fuckin' appear.

1402
01:18:59,317 --> 01:19:01,286
We're apart
for four stupid weeks,

1403
01:19:01,386 --> 01:19:02,554
and I come back to this.

1404
01:19:02,654 --> 01:19:04,089
<i>Listen, if you really care -</i>

1405
01:19:04,189 --> 01:19:06,792
What did I do?
I didn't do anything wrong.

1406
01:19:06,892 --> 01:19:08,527
If you really care about me,

1407
01:19:08,627 --> 01:19:10,729
you need to take the time
to understand me.

1408
01:19:10,829 --> 01:19:11,897
Oh, this is my fault?

1409
01:19:11,997 --> 01:19:13,999
<i>- It's no one's fault.
- Well, that's debatable.</i>

1410
01:19:14,099 --> 01:19:15,367
<i>Look, I told you -</i>

1411
01:19:15,467 --> 01:19:17,002
this was going to be
really difficult -

1412
01:19:17,102 --> 01:19:18,770
<i>Would you just shut up
with the corny, fuckin' lines?</i>

1413
01:19:18,870 --> 01:19:21,060
<i>You don't like me anymore.</i>

1414
01:19:21,160 --> 01:19:22,507
<i>I was amusing
for a minute,</i>

1415
01:19:22,607 --> 01:19:23,909
and now,
I should go away -

1416
01:19:24,009 --> 01:19:27,494
and hang your fucking
picture on the wall!

1417
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:32,150
I mean, what am I
supposed to do here, huh?

1418
01:19:32,250 --> 01:19:33,985
You know, I've done
what you're doing.

1419
01:19:34,085 --> 01:19:35,153
I've said the shit
that you're saying,

1420
01:19:35,253 --> 01:19:36,588
and I know it's a lie.

1421
01:19:36,688 --> 01:19:38,590
- It's not a lie.
- It's a fucking lie.

1422
01:19:38,690 --> 01:19:40,726
Well, maybe you lied to people,
but I am trying to be honest -

1423
01:19:40,826 --> 01:19:42,194
Would you please
stop saying that?

1424
01:19:42,294 --> 01:19:43,895
- Saying what?
- Honest!

1425
01:19:43,995 --> 01:19:46,732
Look, you don't love me.

1426
01:19:46,832 --> 01:19:49,267
I could be any girl.

1427
01:19:49,367 --> 01:19:51,103
I care about you.

1428
01:19:51,203 --> 01:19:53,004
You made me very happy,
but I can't hear myself think -

1429
01:19:53,104 --> 01:19:54,539
when you're in the room.

1430
01:19:54,639 --> 01:19:57,342
Everything is a big
game of pretend with you.

1431
01:19:57,442 --> 01:19:59,010
Let's pretend
to get married,

1432
01:19:59,110 --> 01:20:00,479
<i>let's pretend I'm going to be
a country star -</i>

1433
01:20:00,579 --> 01:20:02,514
<i>just pretend you're
someone else remember?</i>

1434
01:20:02,614 --> 01:20:04,816
No! Nothing
is casual with you.

1435
01:20:04,916 --> 01:20:06,551
Everything
is a fuckin' big deal.

1436
01:20:06,651 --> 01:20:09,521
No! No, no, no, no, no!

1437
01:20:09,621 --> 01:20:11,156
Only you.

1438
01:20:11,256 --> 01:20:12,357
Only you're a big deal.

1439
01:20:12,457 --> 01:20:14,793
Stop it!

1440
01:20:14,893 --> 01:20:18,803
Okay, I'm handling
this pretty badly, aren't I?

1441
01:20:20,715 --> 01:20:23,301
Listen, I'm a great guy.
You love me.

1442
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:25,670
Look at me.

1443
01:20:25,770 --> 01:20:28,607
Would you please
look at me?

1444
01:20:28,707 --> 01:20:31,657
I'm right here; look at me.

1445
01:20:32,761 --> 01:20:35,080
It's my birthday.

1446
01:20:35,180 --> 01:20:38,130
What? What?

1447
01:20:42,804 --> 01:20:45,804
Okay, I'll go.

1448
01:20:47,642 --> 01:20:49,027
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1449
01:20:49,127 --> 01:20:50,495
<i>I'm really sorry.</i>

1450
01:20:50,595 --> 01:20:53,545
<i>I want to make this
easy on you.</i>

1451
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:57,670
I don't want to be pathetic,
I really don't.

1452
01:21:04,259 --> 01:21:07,211
But do you think
you could lie to me a little?

1453
01:21:07,311 --> 01:21:08,647
Or, let me sleep here
next to you -

1454
01:21:08,747 --> 01:21:12,100
something to make this
a little bit easier?

1455
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,718
I cannot do that.

1456
01:21:13,818 --> 01:21:16,768
Yes, you can. God!

1457
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:22,884
I feel like you're playing
some sick practical joke on me.

1458
01:21:23,345 --> 01:21:25,497
I'm sorry you feel like that.

1459
01:21:25,597 --> 01:21:29,082
Would you please
talk to me like a person?

1460
01:21:31,052 --> 01:21:33,305
Look, what you're going through
has happened to me before,

1461
01:21:33,405 --> 01:21:35,373
and once I got through it -

1462
01:21:35,473 --> 01:21:39,298
I was grateful because
I was so much stronger.

1463
01:21:50,572 --> 01:21:53,572
Strong?

1464
01:21:54,442 --> 01:21:57,442
I am fucking strong.

1465
01:22:12,994 --> 01:22:15,994
Where did you go?

1466
01:22:29,978 --> 01:22:32,978
<i>Samantha:
What a fuckin' bitch.</i>

1467
01:22:33,315 --> 01:22:35,500
She didn't seem
like your type anyway.

1468
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:40,188
<i>William: You think anybody
who isn't like you isn't my type.</i>

1469
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:42,307
That's not true.

1470
01:22:42,407 --> 01:22:45,357
She just seemed
a little crunchy.

1471
01:22:46,061 --> 01:22:47,846
I heard she wouldn't fuck you.

1472
01:22:47,946 --> 01:22:51,006
<i>William:
That's not true; we had sex.</i>

1473
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:55,285
Yeah, I didn't believe it
when I heard it.

1474
01:22:55,637 --> 01:22:57,722
I mean,
I couldn't imagine -

1475
01:22:57,822 --> 01:23:00,772
you not fucking anybody.

1476
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:04,462
<i>William:
She wouldn't sleep with me for a while.</i>

1477
01:23:04,562 --> 01:23:07,792
Why not? She have
some kind of hang-up?

1478
01:23:09,884 --> 01:23:12,437
<i>Samantha: I think I was there,
but it was hard because -</i>

1479
01:23:12,537 --> 01:23:14,306
<i>I mean I was walking
and talking -</i>

1480
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:15,807
Okay, so here's
what happened -

1481
01:23:15,907 --> 01:23:17,875
It was pre-school -

1482
01:23:17,975 --> 01:23:19,844
<i>and we went to this park
where I grew up,</i>

1483
01:23:19,944 --> 01:23:21,379
<i>and I was wearing
this very special vest -</i>

1484
01:23:21,479 --> 01:23:22,914
that my grandmother
had just made for me.

1485
01:23:23,014 --> 01:23:24,549
It had like a little purple
unicorn on the pocket.

1486
01:23:24,649 --> 01:23:26,518
<i>It was the very first time
that I wore it</i>

1487
01:23:26,618 --> 01:23:28,119
<i>and my very first memory -</i>

1488
01:23:28,219 --> 01:23:29,554
is of feeding the ducks
that are in the pond,

1489
01:23:29,654 --> 01:23:32,604
in the lake
in Kalispel, Montana.

1490
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:40,421
So, this Sarah girl,
she doesn't love you back?

1491
01:23:42,617 --> 01:23:45,617
No.

1492
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:51,323
Are you sad?

1493
01:23:55,997 --> 01:23:58,997
Whatever.

1494
01:24:18,653 --> 01:24:20,672
Let's go to bed.

1495
01:24:20,772 --> 01:24:23,475
I don't have a bed.

1496
01:24:23,575 --> 01:24:24,809
Really - why?

1497
01:24:24,909 --> 01:24:27,746
William:
Because I hucked it out the window.

1498
01:24:27,846 --> 01:24:30,582
Why?

1499
01:24:30,682 --> 01:24:33,632
I didn't like it anymore.

1500
01:24:36,938 --> 01:24:39,938
God!

1501
01:24:45,447 --> 01:24:48,447
Do you have any condoms?

1502
01:24:55,323 --> 01:24:57,316
William:
Yeah.

1503
01:24:57,416 --> 01:25:00,893
Just give me a minute;
I'll be right back.

1504
01:25:22,851 --> 01:25:25,851
<i>You got to go.</i>

1505
01:25:26,688 --> 01:25:28,473
What are you talking about?

1506
01:25:28,573 --> 01:25:30,008
<i>I'm not doing too well,</i>

1507
01:25:30,108 --> 01:25:33,253
<i>and I don't think
you want to be here.</i>

1508
01:25:37,132 --> 01:25:38,883
Yes, I do.

1509
01:25:38,983 --> 01:25:41,152
Look, just go.

1510
01:25:41,252 --> 01:25:43,455
I really can't deal
with anybody right now.

1511
01:25:43,555 --> 01:25:45,539
I'll call you tomorrow.

1512
01:25:45,639 --> 01:25:48,853
No, just leave me
the fuck alone, okay!

1513
01:26:03,324 --> 01:26:06,324
Then, leave me
the fuck alone.

1514
01:26:15,870 --> 01:26:18,022
What light through
yonder window breaks?

1515
01:26:18,122 --> 01:26:21,267
It is the East,
and Juliet is the sun!

1516
01:26:22,110 --> 01:26:25,680
Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon.

1517
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:32,470
<i>Vince:
Hello?</i>

1518
01:26:32,570 --> 01:26:34,405
<i>Hello?</i>

1519
01:26:34,505 --> 01:26:37,407
<i>William:
Be not her maid since she is envious,</i>

1520
01:26:37,507 --> 01:26:40,628
her vestal livery
is but sick and green,

1521
01:26:40,728 --> 01:26:43,154
and none but fools
do wear it!

1522
01:26:43,254 --> 01:26:45,383
Cast it off.

1523
01:26:45,483 --> 01:26:47,785
It is my lady,
it is my love -

1524
01:26:47,885 --> 01:26:50,835
Oh, that she knew she were.

1525
01:26:53,208 --> 01:26:56,160
<i>Oh, that I were a glove
upon that hand.</i>

1526
01:26:56,260 --> 01:26:59,211
<i>That I might
touch that cheek.</i>

1527
01:26:59,914 --> 01:27:02,000
O, speak again,
bright angel.

1528
01:27:02,100 --> 01:27:03,701
<i>Man:
Hey Romeo, shut up, okay?</i>

1529
01:27:03,801 --> 01:27:06,304
Hey Sarah, you can't say
I didn't go out with a bang;

1530
01:27:06,404 --> 01:27:08,273
you can't say that!

1531
01:27:08,373 --> 01:27:12,026
<i>Phone machine:
Please leave message after tone.</i>

1532
01:27:12,126 --> 01:27:13,845
<i>Sarah:
William if you want to talk to me</i>

1533
01:27:13,945 --> 01:27:15,547
<i>this is not how to do it.</i>

1534
01:27:15,647 --> 01:27:17,382
<i>I'm scared to
leave my apartment.</i>

1535
01:27:17,482 --> 01:27:19,083
<i>Please don't
come by anymore.</i>

1536
01:27:19,183 --> 01:27:22,133
<i>William:
Hey - hey, I'm sorry.</i>

1537
01:27:23,271 --> 01:27:24,589
<i>I don't mean to scare you.</i>

1538
01:27:24,689 --> 01:27:27,458
<i>I just wanted
to say 'Goodbye'</i>

1539
01:27:27,558 --> 01:27:29,327
<i>with the best words I know.</i>

1540
01:27:29,427 --> 01:27:32,377
<i>Sarah:
Yeah, well, goodbye.</i>

1541
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:01,106
Fuck!

1542
01:28:02,877 --> 01:28:05,877
Shit.

1543
01:28:07,482 --> 01:28:09,300
Fuck!

1544
01:28:09,400 --> 01:28:10,468
<i>Vince:
Come on, William.</i>

1545
01:28:10,568 --> 01:28:12,682
<i>William! Come on,come on!</i>

1546
01:28:12,782 --> 01:28:15,240
<i>Alright now, the Cowboys
play on Sunday, alright?</i>

1547
01:28:15,340 --> 01:28:16,674
<i>I do not want you
to miss it.</i>

1548
01:28:16,774 --> 01:28:19,724
This is our year.

1549
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:22,013
Don't get sad, okay.

1550
01:28:22,113 --> 01:28:23,615
When you're thirteen,
I'll ask your mother

1551
01:28:23,715 --> 01:28:25,750
if you can come live with me.
Come on, come on.

1552
01:28:25,850 --> 01:28:27,218
You'd like that,
wouldn't you?

1553
01:28:27,318 --> 01:28:30,121
Alright now, listen to me,
we love you, okay.

1554
01:28:30,221 --> 01:28:32,190
Faye: Hey kiddo,
I packed a few snacks in your bag.

1555
01:28:32,290 --> 01:28:34,259
You're going to like 'em.

1556
01:28:34,359 --> 01:28:36,394
Alright, listen to me now -

1557
01:28:36,494 --> 01:28:40,234
never stray too far
from Texas in your heart.

1558
01:28:45,687 --> 01:28:48,756
<i>William: That was the last
time I ever saw my dad.</i>

1559
01:28:48,856 --> 01:28:50,475
<i>I thought about
calling him and telling him</i>

1560
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:54,229
<i>I had never strayed too far
from Texas in my heart.</i>

1561
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:57,729
<i>And what a crock of shit
that advice was.</i>

1562
01:29:00,835 --> 01:29:02,353
<i>Jesse: I'm glad you
decided to show up, William</i>

1563
01:29:02,453 --> 01:29:05,223
but I need you
to get your act together.

1564
01:29:05,323 --> 01:29:08,273
Take a shower,
change your clothes.

1565
01:29:08,476 --> 01:29:09,961
<i>I'm making an early
Christmas dinner</i>

1566
01:29:10,061 --> 01:29:11,663
<i>for Harris
and his mom tonight.</i>

1567
01:29:11,763 --> 01:29:14,065
Harris and I are going
to Hawaii for Christmas,

1568
01:29:14,165 --> 01:29:15,933
so you'll have to
get along without me.

1569
01:29:16,033 --> 01:29:18,202
I'm sure
you'll miss me terribly.

1570
01:29:18,302 --> 01:29:19,671
<i>William:
Who's Harris?</i>

1571
01:29:19,771 --> 01:29:21,072
He's my boyfriend, William.

1572
01:29:21,172 --> 01:29:22,140
I told you that.

1573
01:29:22,240 --> 01:29:24,409
He's living with you now?

1574
01:29:24,509 --> 01:29:27,427
I've told you all this.

1575
01:29:33,301 --> 01:29:36,301
Sarah:
Hi it's me. Leave a message.

1576
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:38,623
<i>Hey listen,
it's me, William.</i>

1577
01:29:38,723 --> 01:29:40,858
<i>Are you there?</i>

1578
01:29:40,958 --> 01:29:43,908
<i>Are you there?</i>

1579
01:29:44,278 --> 01:29:47,278
Okay, sorry for calling.

1580
01:29:48,049 --> 01:29:50,635
<i>Give me a call
when you get a chance.</i>

1581
01:29:50,735 --> 01:29:53,004
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

1582
01:30:00,561 --> 01:30:03,081
<i>Sarah:
Hi, it's me. Leave a message.</i>

1583
01:30:03,181 --> 01:30:04,582
Hey, sorry for leaving you
another message.

1584
01:30:04,682 --> 01:30:06,184
I just wanted to tell you

1585
01:30:06,284 --> 01:30:08,252
that I know you might not
want to talk to me and -

1586
01:30:08,352 --> 01:30:11,122
if that's the case,
don't worry about it.

1587
01:30:11,222 --> 01:30:13,191
We'll talk
when the time is right.

1588
01:30:13,291 --> 01:30:16,241
Alright. See you.

1589
01:30:25,153 --> 01:30:28,153
<i>Sarah:
Hi, it's me. Leave a message.</i>

1590
01:30:28,523 --> 01:30:29,807
Listen, it's me again.

1591
01:30:29,907 --> 01:30:31,876
This is pretty absurd, huh?

1592
01:30:31,976 --> 01:30:34,679
I just know that you're not
going to call me back,

1593
01:30:34,779 --> 01:30:36,381
and you should.

1594
01:30:36,481 --> 01:30:39,150
I mean, I'd like you to;
that'd be nice.

1595
01:30:39,250 --> 01:30:41,552
Not that you give a rat's ass
about being nice,

1596
01:30:41,652 --> 01:30:43,888
because I know you don't.

1597
01:30:43,988 --> 01:30:45,490
It's just that I went out
with this other girl

1598
01:30:45,590 --> 01:30:47,024
a couple of nights ago -

1599
01:30:47,124 --> 01:30:49,694
Samantha; remember her?

1600
01:30:49,794 --> 01:30:51,429
I mean, I know
that you don't like her

1601
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:53,097
because -
she doesn't spout out

1602
01:30:53,197 --> 01:30:54,499
a lot of intellectual bullshit,

1603
01:30:54,599 --> 01:30:57,549
but - she's real smart.

1604
01:30:57,952 --> 01:31:00,104
You shouldn't think that
just because a girl's pretty,

1605
01:31:00,204 --> 01:31:03,725
she's not smart,
because that's not the case.

1606
01:31:03,825 --> 01:31:05,376
I don't know,
it always seemed to me

1607
01:31:05,476 --> 01:31:08,963
that you had a lot of hang-ups
about shit like that.

1608
01:31:09,063 --> 01:31:11,749
Maybe it's just that
you try to be, like, all -

1609
01:31:11,849 --> 01:31:14,936
extra smart because
you're not that pretty.

1610
01:31:15,036 --> 01:31:18,239
But you shouldn't do that
because you know,

1611
01:31:18,339 --> 01:31:20,458
I think you're pretty.

1612
01:31:20,558 --> 01:31:23,778
Not that you're, like,
fantastically interested in -

1613
01:31:23,878 --> 01:31:28,082
receiving emotional advice
from me or anything but -

1614
01:31:28,182 --> 01:31:31,719
Samantha is definitely
an attractive woman -

1615
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:33,638
and she's smart.

1616
01:31:33,738 --> 01:31:36,574
And, we had a good time.

1617
01:31:36,674 --> 01:31:39,477
It gave me some distance
on us, you know?

1618
01:31:39,577 --> 01:31:42,512
It made me miss you less.

1619
01:31:42,612 --> 01:31:44,882
Not like
I'm some crazy maniac

1620
01:31:44,982 --> 01:31:46,784
missing you
or something, so -

1621
01:31:46,884 --> 01:31:49,587
don't get all freaked out
and call the cops.

1622
01:31:49,687 --> 01:31:52,637
Just call me back, okay?

1623
01:31:53,908 --> 01:31:55,460
That'd be cool, you know?

1624
01:31:55,560 --> 01:31:59,213
I mean, I'm aware
I'm not first on your list -

1625
01:31:59,313 --> 01:32:01,098
of people to please
right now,

1626
01:32:01,198 --> 01:32:04,148
but - just give me a call.

1627
01:32:07,588 --> 01:32:10,588
I really need to talk
to somebody.

1628
01:32:13,227 --> 01:32:15,746
You know what I was thinking
the other day?

1629
01:32:15,846 --> 01:32:17,849
Remember how you used to
walk on the curb,

1630
01:32:17,949 --> 01:32:19,684
and have me walk
on the street,

1631
01:32:19,784 --> 01:32:21,819
so that we could be
the same height?

1632
01:32:21,919 --> 01:32:23,654
Yeah, well,
that's really fucked up.

1633
01:32:23,754 --> 01:32:25,223
You shouldn't do that.

1634
01:32:25,323 --> 01:32:29,403
I'm taller than you,
and you should just face it.

1635
01:32:31,012 --> 01:32:33,464
Yeah, well -

1636
01:32:33,564 --> 01:32:34,832
listen, I don't want to
hang up right now,

1637
01:32:34,932 --> 01:32:36,133
because I know
as soon as I do,

1638
01:32:36,233 --> 01:32:37,468
I'm going to feel like
a real moron.

1639
01:32:37,568 --> 01:32:40,883
So could you just
please call me back -

1640
01:32:41,022 --> 01:32:44,022
otherwise I'll
probably kill myself.

1641
01:32:44,926 --> 01:32:47,178
I'm not going to
kill myself.

1642
01:32:47,278 --> 01:32:50,665
You know, you really have
no sense of humor whatsoever.

1643
01:32:50,765 --> 01:32:53,825
That always drove me
crazy about you.

1644
01:32:56,103 --> 01:32:57,455
All right.

1645
01:32:57,555 --> 01:33:00,505
Call me back, okay?

1646
01:33:03,377 --> 01:33:06,377
I'm going to hang up now. Bye.

1647
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:17,642
<i>Sarah:
William, you have to to calling.</i>

1648
01:33:17,742 --> 01:33:20,695
Hey. I thought you
were probably at your mom's

1649
01:33:20,795 --> 01:33:22,346
for Christmas or something.

1650
01:33:22,446 --> 01:33:25,182
<i>Sarah:
Christmas is still a week away.</i>

1651
01:33:25,282 --> 01:33:28,232
Yeah. I remember.

1652
01:33:29,837 --> 01:33:31,822
I just wanted
to call you back,

1653
01:33:31,922 --> 01:33:34,025
and tell you
I was sorry for calling.

1654
01:33:34,125 --> 01:33:35,893
<i>Sarah:
You sound exhausted.</i>

1655
01:33:35,993 --> 01:33:37,194
<i>Why don't
you get some rest?</i>

1656
01:33:37,294 --> 01:33:40,097
Because I can't sleep.

1657
01:33:40,197 --> 01:33:44,872
You know, I've been thinking
about you a lot recently -

1658
01:33:45,720 --> 01:33:48,406
more like non-stop.

1659
01:33:48,506 --> 01:33:49,907
<i>Sarah: Well, I appreciate
you thinking about me,</i>

1660
01:33:50,007 --> 01:33:53,094
<i>but we shouldn't talk now,
not for a long time.</i>

1661
01:33:53,194 --> 01:33:56,194
Yeah, I think you're right!

1662
01:33:57,798 --> 01:34:00,251
Or else, maybe I just
want to agree on something.

1663
01:34:00,351 --> 01:34:03,751
<i>Sarah:
Let' agree on that, okay? Goodbye.</i>

1664
01:34:11,445 --> 01:34:13,831
<i>Samantha:
All this time, I thought that secretly -</i>

1665
01:34:13,931 --> 01:34:15,366
<i>you were a good person.</i>

1666
01:34:15,466 --> 01:34:17,335
<i>But you're not.</i>

1667
01:34:17,435 --> 01:34:19,570
<i>Priest:
Let us enjoy the spirit of generosity.</i>

1668
01:34:19,670 --> 01:34:21,339
<i>The Peace of the Lord
be with you.</i>

1669
01:34:21,439 --> 01:34:23,274
Congregation:
And also be with you.

1670
01:34:23,374 --> 01:34:25,376
<i>Priest: I'd like to
invite you to open your hearts -</i>

1671
01:34:25,476 --> 01:34:27,612
<i>and shake hands
with the people around you.</i>

1672
01:34:27,712 --> 01:34:30,662
Merry Christmas.

1673
01:34:31,632 --> 01:34:33,484
<i>Samantha:
What is it with you?</i>

1674
01:34:33,584 --> 01:34:36,486
<i>William:
Oh, let's see. I can't sleep.</i>

1675
01:34:36,586 --> 01:34:39,323
I go to the bathroom
about fifteen times an hour.

1676
01:34:39,423 --> 01:34:41,759
<i>I wake up to a voice
inside my head</i>

1677
01:34:41,859 --> 01:34:43,294
<i>that calls myself a faggot -</i>

1678
01:34:43,394 --> 01:34:46,312
with every throbbing
of my pulse.

1679
01:34:46,412 --> 01:34:49,066
<i>I haven't seen my father
since I was eight.</i>

1680
01:34:49,166 --> 01:34:50,735
<i>And, I'm 21 years old now,</i>

1681
01:34:50,835 --> 01:34:52,770
<i>and I feel like I should
have my shit together -</i>

1682
01:34:52,870 --> 01:34:55,106
<i>but all I feel is
everything coming apart.</i>

1683
01:34:55,206 --> 01:34:58,606
<i>And for about three minutes
I believed -</i>

1684
01:34:58,893 --> 01:35:01,878
in destiny and that,
you know, I had one.

1685
01:35:01,978 --> 01:35:04,215
But now, I'm -

1686
01:35:04,315 --> 01:35:07,265
I don't know, adrift.

1687
01:35:08,235 --> 01:35:09,787
I have no connection
to anything.

1688
01:35:09,887 --> 01:35:11,722
<i>Not people, not me -</i>

1689
01:35:11,822 --> 01:35:13,658
<i>not you, not family,</i>

1690
01:35:13,758 --> 01:35:14,992
<i>not the past,
not the future,</i>

1691
01:35:15,092 --> 01:35:18,042
not anything -
you know?

1692
01:35:23,451 --> 01:35:26,451
<i>I keep lookin'
down the road</i>

1693
01:35:31,559 --> 01:35:34,559
<i>Out the window,
high and low</i>

1694
01:35:38,299 --> 01:35:41,299
<i>The cold is risin'
it's halfway gone</i>

1695
01:35:45,306 --> 01:35:48,306
<i>Jesse:
Merry Christmas, William.</i>

1696
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:51,373
<i>I love Christmas morning,
don't you?</i>

1697
01:35:51,473 --> 01:35:52,997
<i>I mean, I know
it's a pain in the ass</i>

1698
01:35:53,097 --> 01:35:56,032
<i>for us to drive around
like this, but your father -</i>

1699
01:35:56,132 --> 01:36:00,221
Your Daddy is what people
like to call 'a project'.

1700
01:36:00,321 --> 01:36:05,081
He wants to make me very small,
and fit me in his pocket.

1701
01:36:06,527 --> 01:36:09,413
You're sweet.

1702
01:36:09,513 --> 01:36:12,249
Merry Christmas, William.

1703
01:36:12,349 --> 01:36:14,085
Isn't this fun?

1704
01:36:14,185 --> 01:36:16,153
Do you think you're going
to get a lot of good presents?

1705
01:36:16,253 --> 01:36:18,289
I think so.

1706
01:36:18,389 --> 01:36:20,424
You know what I want?

1707
01:36:20,524 --> 01:36:23,944
I want your daddy
to stop being such a bully.

1708
01:36:24,044 --> 01:36:27,748
You don't bully women, William;
it's not nice.

1709
01:36:27,848 --> 01:36:30,034
You want to be a cowboy,
you can be a cowboy,

1710
01:36:30,134 --> 01:36:33,084
but you be
a gentleman cowboy.

1711
01:36:35,823 --> 01:36:38,109
<i>Look you just be
whatever you want.</i>

1712
01:36:38,209 --> 01:36:40,193
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

1713
01:36:40,293 --> 01:36:43,227
<i>Goddamn it.</i>

1714
01:36:44,765 --> 01:36:47,765
Vince:
Hey! Hey! No!

1715
01:36:48,502 --> 01:36:49,854
<i>Jesse:
Stay in the car.</i>

1716
01:36:49,954 --> 01:36:51,155
<i>You hear me?
You stay in this car.</i>

1717
01:36:51,255 --> 01:36:52,790
Now, I told you
not to be here!

1718
01:36:52,890 --> 01:36:55,326
I told you not -

1719
01:36:55,426 --> 01:36:57,027
Vince:
Fuck you!

1720
01:36:57,127 --> 01:36:58,529
- Leave him alone.
- Hey buddy -

1721
01:36:58,629 --> 01:37:02,114
Merry Christmas, okay.
This is from Santa.

1722
01:37:02,716 --> 01:37:05,302
That's it. Okay, goodbye.
Merry Christmas.

1723
01:37:05,402 --> 01:37:08,272
Vince:
Yeah, Merry Christmas to you too.

1724
01:37:22,436 --> 01:37:25,436
<i>Jesse:
Buddy, what' going on?</i>

1725
01:37:26,207 --> 01:37:29,267
I love that stupid girl
so much, Mom.

1726
01:37:34,949 --> 01:37:37,168
I fell in love
with your father

1727
01:37:37,268 --> 01:37:39,436
because of the way
he told a joke.

1728
01:37:39,536 --> 01:37:42,306
That doesn't always work.

1729
01:37:42,406 --> 01:37:45,636
My point is,
it's all pretty arbitrary.

1730
01:37:47,494 --> 01:37:49,146
Your whole life,

1731
01:37:49,246 --> 01:37:51,048
people are going to ask you
to be weak, William.

1732
01:37:51,148 --> 01:37:53,050
They'll practically beg you.

1733
01:37:53,150 --> 01:37:54,852
But all anybody
really wants from you,

1734
01:37:54,952 --> 01:37:57,902
is for you to be strong.

1735
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:03,541
Look -

1736
01:38:06,180 --> 01:38:09,180
It's a baptism -

1737
01:38:11,919 --> 01:38:14,919
by ice.

1738
01:38:24,965 --> 01:38:27,965
<i>Is it written
in the stars</i>

1739
01:38:32,606 --> 01:38:35,606
<i>Were we've been
or where we are?</i>

1740
01:38:39,280 --> 01:38:42,280
<i>And where we're going</i>

1741
01:38:43,784 --> 01:38:46,784
<i>I don't know</i>

1742
01:39:01,702 --> 01:39:02,720
<i>Faye:
Hello.</i>

1743
01:39:02,820 --> 01:39:05,770
Hi, I'm William.

1744
01:39:07,241 --> 01:39:09,793
William! Wow.

1745
01:39:09,893 --> 01:39:12,096
You're all grown up.

1746
01:39:12,196 --> 01:39:15,146
Yeah. Is my Dad here?

1747
01:39:15,516 --> 01:39:16,967
Yeah. Come on;
come on in.

1748
01:39:17,067 --> 01:39:18,769
It's okay; I'll wait here.

1749
01:39:18,869 --> 01:39:21,639
You sure? Okay, one second.

1750
01:39:21,739 --> 01:39:24,408
Vincent! Hey, Vince?

1751
01:39:24,508 --> 01:39:27,458
<i>Vince:
Yeah, what?</i>

1752
01:39:29,430 --> 01:39:32,430
<i>What? What is it?</i>

1753
01:39:36,470 --> 01:39:39,470
Hey there, William,
how you doing?

1754
01:39:40,207 --> 01:39:41,225
William:
Good.

1755
01:39:41,325 --> 01:39:42,393
Well, come on inside.

1756
01:39:42,493 --> 01:39:43,527
Can I talk to you
for a minute?

1757
01:39:43,627 --> 01:39:44,895
Sure, come on in.

1758
01:39:44,995 --> 01:39:49,075
No, would you mind
stepping outside for a second?

1759
01:39:49,616 --> 01:39:51,068
- Vince: Sure.
- Faye: Hey, Thomas.

1760
01:39:51,168 --> 01:39:53,771
Let me get my jacket, alright?

1761
01:39:53,871 --> 01:39:56,340
- William: You watching the game?
- Vince: Yeah, yeah.

1762
01:39:56,440 --> 01:39:58,475
- William: Cowboys?
- Vince: Yeah, yeah.

1763
01:39:58,575 --> 01:40:00,144
William:
They any good this year?

1764
01:40:00,244 --> 01:40:03,194
No, no, they suck.

1765
01:40:04,798 --> 01:40:07,351
I don't really follow them
too much any more.

1766
01:40:07,451 --> 01:40:08,419
No?

1767
01:40:08,519 --> 01:40:11,469
<i>Well they're kind of -</i>

1768
01:40:11,972 --> 01:40:13,991
Sweetie, Lisa,
get out of here, darling.

1769
01:40:14,091 --> 01:40:16,293
Go back to the kitchen.

1770
01:40:16,393 --> 01:40:19,343
So listen -

1771
01:40:19,446 --> 01:40:22,066
Could I bum one of those?

1772
01:40:22,166 --> 01:40:26,076
Remember that time we were
shooting those cans?

1773
01:40:27,187 --> 01:40:28,706
No.

1774
01:40:28,806 --> 01:40:31,208
Behind the supermarket?

1775
01:40:31,308 --> 01:40:33,143
Okay.

1776
01:40:33,243 --> 01:40:35,980
Yeah well, you said
that day that -

1777
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:38,215
when I was thirteen,
I could come live with you.

1778
01:40:38,315 --> 01:40:41,265
You said that
a bunch of times.

1779
01:40:42,202 --> 01:40:43,988
Yeah.

1780
01:40:44,088 --> 01:40:46,957
<i>Yeah well, my thirteenth
birthday's come and gone -</i>

1781
01:40:47,057 --> 01:40:49,927
<i>and you never even
called me.</i>

1782
01:40:50,027 --> 01:40:51,862
<i>In point and fact -</i>

1783
01:40:51,962 --> 01:40:56,467
<i>I haven't heard from you at all
in a pretty long time.</i>

1784
01:40:57,284 --> 01:40:59,003
I'm sorry.

1785
01:40:59,103 --> 01:41:02,790
<i>Well apology not accepted,
you know what I mean?</i>

1786
01:41:02,890 --> 01:41:04,742
Yeah, I know
what you mean.

1787
01:41:04,842 --> 01:41:07,511
Look William -

1788
01:41:07,611 --> 01:41:11,096
it was so hard on you
when you were little

1789
01:41:11,198 --> 01:41:12,616
when we would -

1790
01:41:12,716 --> 01:41:15,666
You know,
and your mother - she -

1791
01:41:17,638 --> 01:41:20,808
You know, and then,
I got remarried and -

1792
01:41:20,908 --> 01:41:23,860
Every family -

1793
01:41:23,960 --> 01:41:25,162
<i>Can we talk about
something else?</i>

1794
01:41:25,262 --> 01:41:28,212
Yeah.

1795
01:41:28,315 --> 01:41:31,315
I fell in love
with this girl,

1796
01:41:31,418 --> 01:41:32,970
but she broke up with me.

1797
01:41:33,070 --> 01:41:35,439
<i>Yeah?</i>

1798
01:41:35,539 --> 01:41:37,408
She kind of
broke my heart, I think.

1799
01:41:37,508 --> 01:41:39,676
<i>That'll happen.</i>

1800
01:41:39,776 --> 01:41:41,545
That happen to you?

1801
01:41:41,645 --> 01:41:43,013
<i>Sure, sure, I guess.</i>

1802
01:41:43,113 --> 01:41:46,063
Did my mom
break your heart?

1803
01:41:47,234 --> 01:41:50,464
<i>I don't know.
That was a long time ago.</i>

1804
01:41:51,405 --> 01:41:53,223
<i>Well, you got over it, huh?</i>

1805
01:41:53,323 --> 01:41:55,426
<i>I guess.</i>

1806
01:41:55,526 --> 01:41:57,728
Well, good for you.

1807
01:41:57,828 --> 01:42:00,097
I just feel like I might not
get over it, you know?

1808
01:42:00,197 --> 01:42:03,000
Like maybe I'm too sensitive
or something.

1809
01:42:03,100 --> 01:42:06,755
Well, maybe you won't.
You know what I mean?

1810
01:42:07,621 --> 01:42:10,573
You'll move on, but -

1811
01:42:10,673 --> 01:42:12,876
if it hurt real bad,
then it'll scar -

1812
01:42:12,976 --> 01:42:15,712
or, like a bone fracture,
or something,

1813
01:42:15,812 --> 01:42:17,614
it'll ache
when it rains.

1814
01:42:17,714 --> 01:42:19,116
Sounds like some
real deep advice -

1815
01:42:19,216 --> 01:42:22,531
coming from a guy
who bailed on his son.

1816
01:42:23,137 --> 01:42:24,721
I'm just doing my best here.

1817
01:42:24,821 --> 01:42:26,123
<i>Well it's not very good,
your best.</i>

1818
01:42:26,223 --> 01:42:29,173
No, no, it's not.

1819
01:42:29,576 --> 01:42:31,662
I was in a movie.

1820
01:42:31,762 --> 01:42:33,063
I bet you didn't know that.

1821
01:42:33,163 --> 01:42:34,731
<i>No, a movie?</i>

1822
01:42:34,831 --> 01:42:37,918
Yeah, I'm going to be
a big fat fuckin' movie star.

1823
01:42:38,018 --> 01:42:39,937
And people are going to ask you
if you're related to me,

1824
01:42:40,037 --> 01:42:41,171
and you're going
to have to say -

1825
01:42:41,271 --> 01:42:44,331
"Yup, he's my son
that I never seen. "

1826
01:42:45,025 --> 01:42:47,511
Well, that would be great.

1827
01:42:47,611 --> 01:42:50,671
Why are you being so -
I don't know.

1828
01:42:50,998 --> 01:42:52,994
<i>How do you
want me to be?</i>

1829
01:42:53,094 --> 01:42:55,034
I don't know.

1830
01:42:55,134 --> 01:42:57,421
<i>- I wanted you to call me, that's all.
- I'm sorry.</i>

1831
01:42:57,521 --> 01:43:01,809
You know, I thought -
I thought it would be better for you -

1832
01:43:01,909 --> 01:43:04,909
Goddamn, it is bitch cold.

1833
01:43:05,279 --> 01:43:06,997
I thought it was supposed
to be hot in Texas.

1834
01:43:07,097 --> 01:43:08,265
<i>Yeah, it's
the Hottest State.</i>

1835
01:43:08,365 --> 01:43:09,533
What?

1836
01:43:09,633 --> 01:43:10,734
Fort Worth
is the Hottest State I know.

1837
01:43:10,834 --> 01:43:11,869
My dad lives there,
my grandma too,

1838
01:43:11,969 --> 01:43:13,570
most every grandparent
except a few.

1839
01:43:13,670 --> 01:43:16,620
I like it there.
Boy, is it hot.

1840
01:43:17,157 --> 01:43:19,042
<i>What's that?</i>

1841
01:43:19,142 --> 01:43:22,329
It's a poem you wrote
when you were a kid.

1842
01:43:22,429 --> 01:43:24,148
Oh yeah?

1843
01:43:24,248 --> 01:43:28,402
Does that make you feel better
that you remember some poem?

1844
01:43:28,502 --> 01:43:31,502
No, it doesn't.

1845
01:43:32,306 --> 01:43:35,306
I loved you so much,
and then -

1846
01:43:38,912 --> 01:43:41,665
Hey, what have I got to do
to get this girl back?

1847
01:43:41,765 --> 01:43:44,635
<i>You can't will anybody
to do anything.</i>

1848
01:43:44,735 --> 01:43:46,436
What do I have to do?

1849
01:43:46,536 --> 01:43:48,038
What was her name?

1850
01:43:48,138 --> 01:43:50,841
<i>Sarah.</i>

1851
01:43:50,941 --> 01:43:53,891
Did she ever love you?

1852
01:43:54,294 --> 01:43:55,646
I don't know.

1853
01:43:55,746 --> 01:43:58,696
I think so.

1854
01:44:00,567 --> 01:44:04,052
Don't do anything,
just be cool, you know.

1855
01:44:04,838 --> 01:44:07,838
Just wait;
she'll call you.

1856
01:44:07,975 --> 01:44:09,459
<i>- She won't.
- Yes, she will.</i>

1857
01:44:09,559 --> 01:44:10,727
<i>No, she won't.</i>

1858
01:44:10,827 --> 01:44:12,129
Well then, fuck her;
you know.

1859
01:44:12,229 --> 01:44:14,264
People who give up on love
aren't worth loving.

1860
01:44:14,364 --> 01:44:16,667
What's that say about you?

1861
01:44:16,767 --> 01:44:18,902
I don't know
what it says about me.

1862
01:44:19,002 --> 01:44:21,505
But, seeing you here
today -

1863
01:44:21,605 --> 01:44:24,555
says a hell of a lot
about you.

1864
01:44:57,557 --> 01:45:01,127
<i>Dave:
Do you what to do it in the same key?</i>

1865
01:45:15,108 --> 01:45:17,728
Hi.

1866
01:45:17,828 --> 01:45:20,778
Hi.

1867
01:45:21,948 --> 01:45:24,468
Do you want to sit down?

1868
01:45:24,568 --> 01:45:26,552
Sure.

1869
01:45:26,652 --> 01:45:29,306
<i>Sarah:
We've been away for a little while -</i>

1870
01:45:29,406 --> 01:45:33,093
<i>doing some tour
of some Canadian Universities.</i>

1871
01:45:33,193 --> 01:45:36,897
<i>And I don't know, I thought
it might be a good idea</i>

1872
01:45:36,997 --> 01:45:38,215
<i>if we said, 'Hello. '</i>

1873
01:45:38,315 --> 01:45:40,150
It might be.

1874
01:45:40,250 --> 01:45:41,718
How are you?

1875
01:45:41,818 --> 01:45:43,186
You know -

1876
01:45:43,286 --> 01:45:46,236
fine - good!
How about you?

1877
01:45:48,942 --> 01:45:51,942
Like a cat,
always nervous.

1878
01:45:52,512 --> 01:45:53,730
<i>Don't worry.</i>

1879
01:45:53,830 --> 01:45:54,865
<i>I'm not going to
break anything.</i>

1880
01:45:54,965 --> 01:45:57,501
No, about performing.

1881
01:45:57,601 --> 01:46:01,668
My mom is comin tonight,
and she's so ridiculous.

1882
01:46:01,768 --> 01:46:04,041
<i>William:
Sounds like a big night.</i>

1883
01:46:04,141 --> 01:46:07,091
<i>Sarah:
Yeah.</i>

1884
01:46:09,563 --> 01:46:12,531
<i>I just want to tell you that -</i>

1885
01:46:12,631 --> 01:46:16,881
the week I spent with you
in Mexico was probably -

1886
01:46:17,337 --> 01:46:20,822
the best six days
of my whole life, and -

1887
01:46:22,876 --> 01:46:25,879
I'm sorry it all didn't
go down the perfect way.

1888
01:46:25,979 --> 01:46:30,050
But when I think about the time
we spent together now -

1889
01:46:30,150 --> 01:46:33,465
<i>I am grateful -
for what it did for me.</i>

1890
01:46:36,990 --> 01:46:41,240
I don't know, I just think
that you're too intense.

1891
01:46:43,530 --> 01:46:46,760
<i>You are -
I mean, you're very intense.</i>

1892
01:46:49,970 --> 01:46:52,389
<i>- You think I'm intense?
- Yeah.</i>

1893
01:46:52,489 --> 01:46:55,092
Really?
I thought -

1894
01:46:55,192 --> 01:46:59,017
I don't know what I thought
but something bad.

1895
01:47:00,414 --> 01:47:02,199
'Intense' sounds good.

1896
01:47:02,299 --> 01:47:04,101
<i>I'm glad it was you.</i>

1897
01:47:04,201 --> 01:47:07,746
<i>If somebody's going to -
break your heart,</i>

1898
01:47:07,846 --> 01:47:11,901
you want it to be -
you know, somebody like you.

1899
01:47:16,029 --> 01:47:19,137
You've always had
a very deluded sense

1900
01:47:19,237 --> 01:47:21,051
of how interesting I am.

1901
01:47:21,151 --> 01:47:23,787
Yeah, well, I like you.

1902
01:47:23,887 --> 01:47:26,321
<i>And I didn't
break your heart.</i>

1903
01:47:26,421 --> 01:47:30,554
Your heart was broken long
before you ever met me.

1904
01:47:30,777 --> 01:47:33,777
Oh, give yourself
a little credit.

1905
01:47:34,014 --> 01:47:37,014
Whatever.

1906
01:47:39,453 --> 01:47:41,304
How's the movie business?

1907
01:47:41,404 --> 01:47:42,706
It' good.

1908
01:47:42,806 --> 01:47:45,951
<i>I'm - starting
a new one this summer.</i>

1909
01:47:46,593 --> 01:47:48,779
Oh wow, cool.

1910
01:47:48,879 --> 01:47:50,981
<i>Dave:
Hey Sarah, you want to try one?</i>

1911
01:47:51,081 --> 01:47:52,416
Sure.

1912
01:47:52,516 --> 01:47:54,117
Are you going to stick
around for the show?

1913
01:47:54,217 --> 01:47:55,185
<i>Yeah sure, I'll be around.</i>

1914
01:47:55,285 --> 01:47:58,235
Okay.

1915
01:48:10,083 --> 01:48:11,868
My heart is gold.

1916
01:48:11,968 --> 01:48:14,918
What will you
give me for it?

1917
01:48:22,128 --> 01:48:25,128
<i>You watch your footsteps
in a dream</i>

1918
01:48:33,874 --> 01:48:36,874
<i>You climb a staircase
and turn a key</i>

1919
01:48:44,651 --> 01:48:47,651
<i>And walk in through
the open door</i>

1920
01:48:55,729 --> 01:48:58,729
<i>Where you once lived
years before</i>

1921
01:49:05,305 --> 01:49:08,305
<i>Years before</i>

1922
01:49:10,410 --> 01:49:13,410
<i>Then it all goes
just as fast</i>

1923
01:49:21,788 --> 01:49:24,788
<i>You reach your hand out</i>

1924
01:49:27,360 --> 01:49:30,360
<i>To touch the past,
touch the past</i>

1925
01:50:00,627 --> 01:50:01,778
<i>William:
I remember, as a kid,</i>

1926
01:50:01,878 --> 01:50:03,547
<i>I used to walk
down the street,</i>

1927
01:50:03,647 --> 01:50:05,849
<i>twenty or so paces
behind my mother,</i>

1928
01:50:05,949 --> 01:50:09,035
<i>so that people would think
I was an orphan.</i>

1929
01:50:09,135 --> 01:50:11,788
<i>I wanted
to believe it myself.</i>

1930
01:50:11,888 --> 01:50:15,609
<i>Not because I wished
my parents dead or anything</i>

1931
01:50:15,709 --> 01:50:18,709
<i>but more because
orphans were tough.</i>

1932
01:50:19,546 --> 01:50:22,546
<i>They could handle anything.</i>

1933
01:50:23,249 --> 01:50:24,935
<i>And because
I wanted to be free</i>

1934
01:50:25,035 --> 01:50:27,337
<i>from this emotional
chain reaction</i>

1935
01:50:27,437 --> 01:50:31,258
<i>that seemed to be sparking off
like a string of firecrackers</i>

1936
01:50:31,358 --> 01:50:34,358
<i>since the day I was born.</i>

1937
01:50:34,527 --> 01:50:38,947
<i>I felt that again only now,
I didn't have to pretend.</i>

1938
01:50:39,966 --> 01:50:42,519
<i>It was real.</i>

1939
01:50:42,619 --> 01:50:45,196
<i>I was 21-</i>

1940
01:50:45,297 --> 01:50:49,003
<i>an adult,
and an orphan at last</i>
