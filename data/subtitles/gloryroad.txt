1
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:17,180
Times are changing.

2
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:20,011
I'm Ed Sullivan. And this is Broadway.

3
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:29,227
I have a dream.

4
00:00:36,735 --> 00:00:38,168
I am the greatest!

5
00:00:40,572 --> 00:00:42,597
By the content
of their character.

6
00:00:53,752 --> 00:00:56,846
Hey. You guys are playing like girls.

7
00:00:56,922 --> 00:00:58,856
Are you kiddin' me?

8
00:00:58,924 --> 00:01:02,189
Hey, hey, Winnaker,
do you want me to get you a skirt?

9
00:01:02,261 --> 00:01:04,729
I'll get you a skirt
if you keep playing like a girl.

10
00:01:04,797 --> 00:01:07,322
There it is, there it is.
Come on, set it up.

11
00:01:07,399 --> 00:01:10,334
Bring it down, bring it down.
Set it up! Set it up!

12
00:01:10,402 --> 00:01:14,463
There it is. Pop the ball.
Pop it in there, pop it in there.

13
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,974
All right, good. There it is.

14
00:01:24,183 --> 00:01:25,912
Congratulations, Coach.

15
00:01:34,726 --> 00:01:35,420
Unh!

16
00:01:39,431 --> 00:01:43,128
- That's good. That's perfect.
- OK. You do that.

17
00:01:51,477 --> 00:01:54,605
Get your arm up. There it is.
That's good, that's perfect.

18
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:57,046
You go like this.

19
00:01:57,116 --> 00:01:58,981
- Shush.

20
00:01:59,051 --> 00:02:01,042
All right. Here you go.

21
00:02:01,253 --> 00:02:04,711
- My dad can slam-dunk it.
- Let me do it. Let me do it, Dad!

22
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:08,226
Great. All right, Mark, that's good.
That's good ball-handling.

23
00:02:08,293 --> 00:02:11,091
Brent, you ready? This is a bounce pass.

24
00:02:16,034 --> 00:02:18,832
- It's all right. You'll live.

25
00:02:18,904 --> 00:02:22,067
- It wasn't me. It was Dad.
- Traitor.

26
00:02:22,141 --> 00:02:24,302
I'm not getting in trouble.

27
00:02:24,376 --> 00:02:26,640
Catch it with your hands,
not your arms.

28
00:02:29,114 --> 00:02:30,672
Hello.

29
00:02:31,683 --> 00:02:32,775
This is Don.

30
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:36,981
We know you blew out your knee.
It's tough, giving up a dream, starting over,

31
00:02:37,055 --> 00:02:40,889
but I'm glad to hear you're interested
in a coaching position, Mr. Haskins.

32
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,393
McCarty here says you're a winner.

33
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:47,330
I sure appreciate that.
Now, my style of coaching is one that...

34
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:51,165
You played for Mr. Iba, so you know
how to reign in these unruly boys.

35
00:02:51,236 --> 00:02:54,899
Sir, I do believe in discipline.
Now, my basketball philosophy is...

36
00:02:54,973 --> 00:02:59,933
Mr. Haskins. You know, we're a small
school and we can't pay very much.

37
00:03:00,012 --> 00:03:03,971
So we're gonna need you to live
in the men's dorm with your family

38
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:07,485
and keep those boys in line over there.

39
00:03:07,553 --> 00:03:09,851
But your meals are free at the cafeteria.

40
00:03:09,922 --> 00:03:16,157
And you got plenty of Texas sunshine.
So... how's it sound?

41
00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:23,131
If that's what it takes
to coach Division I basketball, then...

42
00:03:23,202 --> 00:03:25,500
ha-ha-ha, that's all right with me.

43
00:03:26,939 --> 00:03:28,804
It's just a dusty old cow town.

44
00:03:28,874 --> 00:03:32,503
Yeah, but if it's got a court with a roof
and uniforms that match,

45
00:03:32,578 --> 00:03:36,070
then I wanna coach there.
I wanna play against the best.

46
00:03:36,148 --> 00:03:38,844
I just wanted to thank you
for bringing me on.

47
00:03:38,917 --> 00:03:40,509
Us Aggies gotta stick together.

48
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:43,578
- You've been here a few weeks.
- Yeah.

49
00:03:43,655 --> 00:03:45,555
What you think?

50
00:03:45,624 --> 00:03:50,823
It ain't much, but we can do something
with it. Here we go. Ready?

51
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:53,797
This is where you're gonna be living.

52
00:03:53,865 --> 00:03:55,423
Hey, Coach.

53
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:59,027
Ross Moore, team trainer
and spiritual advisor.

54
00:03:59,104 --> 00:04:01,937
We're gonna need some of that.
This is my wife, Mary.

55
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:04,305
Hi, Mrs. Haskins. Come on in here.

56
00:04:04,376 --> 00:04:06,503
- Hate to put you out.
- Oh, no.

57
00:04:06,578 --> 00:04:08,773
You ain't putting me out.
Don't think about it.

58
00:04:08,847 --> 00:04:12,112
I'm thinking about leaving
this prize gator here for you.

59
00:04:12,184 --> 00:04:14,880
- Makes a fine ceiling ornament.
- Cool.

60
00:04:14,953 --> 00:04:16,511
You hear that? I made up my mind.

61
00:04:16,588 --> 00:04:19,716
That little boy love that gator.
I'm gonna leave him there.

62
00:04:20,292 --> 00:04:23,090
I've been checking the cupboard.
It's a little bare.

63
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:26,528
We got Baudoin outta Albuquerque,
20 points a game last year.

64
00:04:26,598 --> 00:04:31,729
Got us a Missouri boy. Fast and tough
on defense - a kid named Armstrong.

65
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:37,866
David Palacio,
he's the top prep scorer in El Paso.

66
00:04:37,943 --> 00:04:40,036
Waiting on junior-college transfers.

67
00:04:40,112 --> 00:04:44,446
And Jerry in Housing says
on taco night, we get a real good crowd.

68
00:04:44,516 --> 00:04:46,211
Taco night?

69
00:04:46,518 --> 00:04:47,951
Taco night.

70
00:04:50,422 --> 00:04:52,686
What's the budget for recruiting?

71
00:04:52,758 --> 00:04:55,659
Ross says the budget's in the lights.

72
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:06,596
How can I have a winning team
with no budget for recruiting?

73
00:05:06,672 --> 00:05:10,574
Now, listen, Coach. Football is king here.

74
00:05:10,642 --> 00:05:13,167
And basketball sucks hind tit.

75
00:05:13,245 --> 00:05:17,477
I'll shake down the boosters for a few more
bucks, get a couple more scholarships.

76
00:05:17,549 --> 00:05:18,982
A few more bucks?

77
00:05:19,051 --> 00:05:22,714
I gotta go find players. How can I recruit
with one or two scholarships?

78
00:05:22,788 --> 00:05:27,122
Do you forget where you come from, Don?
Coaching high school girls.

79
00:05:27,192 --> 00:05:31,094
Take a look around you.
This ain't Kansas, Duke, Kentucky.

80
00:05:31,163 --> 00:05:35,361
We're a poor school that counts
every penny to pay for a river rat's dream

81
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:36,958
of a college education.

82
00:05:37,035 --> 00:05:39,435
We're lucky to put a decent team
on the court.

83
00:05:39,504 --> 00:05:42,029
Well, decent don't cut it with me.

84
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:46,801
Duke's where you wanna go.

85
00:05:46,878 --> 00:05:49,676
Hey, how you doing?
Don Haskins, Texas Western.

86
00:05:49,748 --> 00:05:51,648
How you doing? Don Haskins.

87
00:05:53,185 --> 00:05:56,621
- See anyone you like?
- What about number three over there?

88
00:05:56,688 --> 00:06:00,021
Jason Stevens out of Chicago.
18 points a game.

89
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:02,925
Hasn't signed a letter of intent yet.

90
00:06:02,994 --> 00:06:04,791
Jason!

91
00:06:04,863 --> 00:06:06,797
Beating a dead horse there, Don.

92
00:06:06,865 --> 00:06:10,198
- Jason, Don Haskins, Texas Western.
- Western Union?

93
00:06:10,268 --> 00:06:12,463
Texas Western, down in El Paso.

94
00:06:12,537 --> 00:06:15,904
After the game, I'd like to talk to you
about playing for me.

95
00:06:15,974 --> 00:06:21,241
Play for you at Texas Western?
Thanks, Coach, but I'm partial to winning.

96
00:06:25,217 --> 00:06:29,483
How about that big ol' tall boy?
Made All-Jayhawk Conference last year.

97
00:06:29,554 --> 00:06:32,523
Gonna sign with Kansas.

98
00:07:01,787 --> 00:07:04,517
You wanna talk to Bobby Joe Hill?

99
00:07:04,589 --> 00:07:07,387
Son, you can't win playing nigger ball.

100
00:07:07,459 --> 00:07:10,587
Sure, they can jump, but they can't lead.

101
00:07:10,662 --> 00:07:13,426
Can't handle the pressure.
Don't have enough intelligence.

102
00:07:13,498 --> 00:07:16,592
That boy in particular.
No-account smart-mouth.

103
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:19,260
Just tell me where I can find him.

104
00:07:21,406 --> 00:07:25,536
Excuse me. I'm the basketball coach
down at Texas Western.

105
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:28,738
- I'd like to talk to you about playing there.
- No, thanks.

106
00:07:28,814 --> 00:07:32,614
I'm done playing this game.
They hardly put me on the floor tonight.

107
00:07:32,684 --> 00:07:34,879
- I'm offering a full scholarship.
- Uh-huh.

108
00:07:34,953 --> 00:07:38,821
You sign me up like your token Negro,
bury me at the end of the bench.

109
00:07:38,890 --> 00:07:41,620
I'd rather hang it up. Do something else.

110
00:07:41,693 --> 00:07:45,424
Be the next Smokey Robinson.
I might even run for president.

111
00:07:45,497 --> 00:07:48,830
You got a real talent, son.
Why throw it away?

112
00:07:49,935 --> 00:07:54,395
I'll tell you why. Ever since I was a kid, I
only loved one thing - that was playing ball.

113
00:07:54,473 --> 00:07:57,931
Do you understand what that's like,
to have that ball in your hand?

114
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:00,477
It's like making sweet music
with your game.

115
00:08:00,545 --> 00:08:04,174
Only thing is,
you don't wanna hear the song.

116
00:08:08,753 --> 00:08:10,983
You talk a good game, Hill.

117
00:08:11,656 --> 00:08:14,625
I didn't come here to find a player
I could sit on the bench.

118
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:18,527
I intend to start you -
start NCAA Division One ball.

119
00:08:18,597 --> 00:08:23,034
What is it with you, mister?
I've accepted it. What are you smoking?

120
00:08:23,768 --> 00:08:26,066
I ain't smoking nothing, son.

121
00:08:27,205 --> 00:08:32,973
Now, you just told me about a big old
dream you have. I can let you play.

122
00:08:33,044 --> 00:08:38,311
I can help you make your dream come true
faster than a twister'll take your socks off.

123
00:08:43,688 --> 00:08:45,178
You talk funny.

124
00:08:45,257 --> 00:08:47,487
So do you.

125
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:49,993
You gonna let a black player play
from the get-go?

126
00:08:50,061 --> 00:08:54,327
I don't see color. I see quick,
I see skill, and that's what you have.

127
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,732
And that's what I'm putting on the court.

128
00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:08,707
So, what is this team, anyway?

129
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:11,715
All right, that New York recruiter,
Hilton White.

130
00:09:11,783 --> 00:09:15,014
He's got three boys up there now.
They're just playground kids.

131
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:17,384
He said they could play with anybody.

132
00:09:17,455 --> 00:09:22,017
Every one of these players
you're looking at is colored, Don.

133
00:09:23,228 --> 00:09:24,923
How many are you recruiting?

134
00:09:24,996 --> 00:09:28,454
We need seven players on this team
who can put it in the hole and rebound.

135
00:09:28,533 --> 00:09:30,899
Now, if they're colored, well, fine.

136
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:35,832
Well, then now, Coach,
let me try to paint you a little picture.

137
00:09:35,907 --> 00:09:39,502
There are no coloreds playing
Division One basketball in the South.

138
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:44,413
Not in the SEC, not in the ACC
and not in the SWC.

139
00:09:44,482 --> 00:09:46,950
But you go and put seven of 'em
on our team.

140
00:09:47,018 --> 00:09:50,283
Am I losing my hearing?
Do I need a darn hearing aid?

141
00:09:50,355 --> 00:09:53,256
No, Ross. I intend to win.

142
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:57,787
Shoot. You carrying on like Negroes
gonna be the future of basketball.

143
00:09:57,862 --> 00:09:59,762
Could you imagine that?

144
00:10:00,565 --> 00:10:02,897
There are rules. Unwritten rules.

145
00:10:02,968 --> 00:10:07,428
You play one at home, two on the road
and three if you're losing.

146
00:10:07,505 --> 00:10:10,941
Lord have mercy. Loadin' up
on Negroes, that just ain't done.

147
00:10:11,009 --> 00:10:16,311
You gonna put your career at risk,
my career at risk and Moe's career at risk.

148
00:10:16,381 --> 00:10:20,249
If that wasn't bad enough, we ain't
even got enough gas money to get home.

149
00:10:20,318 --> 00:10:22,809
Ain't it lucky you don't got
to worry about that?

150
00:10:22,887 --> 00:10:25,947
'Cause you'll be out on the first bus
to New York tomorrow.

151
00:10:26,024 --> 00:10:30,654
You're sending me there for schoolyard
players? You gotta be out of your mind.

152
00:10:30,729 --> 00:10:33,527
And who's paying for all this,
if you don't mind me asking?

153
00:10:33,598 --> 00:10:37,762
You wanna win. You gotta
recruit. That's how the big boys do it.

154
00:10:46,678 --> 00:10:48,111
It was a good game, man.

155
00:10:48,179 --> 00:10:50,204
Hey, kid, you got a minute?

156
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:53,250
Mama baked a pie. One piece left,
it's got my name all over it.

157
00:10:53,318 --> 00:10:56,219
Hey, kid, you got a minute?

158
00:10:57,989 --> 00:11:00,822
- You know that guy?
- What? No.

159
00:11:00,892 --> 00:11:03,292
Kid, you got a minute?

160
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:05,420
Run. Run!

161
00:11:09,768 --> 00:11:11,759
Hey, Charlie!

162
00:11:16,007 --> 00:11:19,909
Hey, Mama. You're not gonna believe
what just happened to me and Alvin.

163
00:11:19,978 --> 00:11:23,038
Almost got jumped
by a couple of crackers.

164
00:11:23,114 --> 00:11:25,446
I'm just dying for a piece of that...

165
00:11:25,517 --> 00:11:28,247
...pie.
- Ma'am, this pie is so good,

166
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:30,583
it makes me mad at my mama.

167
00:11:30,655 --> 00:11:34,056
This is Mr. Haskins.
He come all the way from El Paso, Texas.

168
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:36,457
He want you to play basketball
on a scholarship.

169
00:11:36,528 --> 00:11:39,520
Texas? To get lynched?

170
00:11:39,597 --> 00:11:44,830
Now, El Paso's not like the rest of Texas.
It's, um... It's more cosmopolitan.

171
00:11:44,903 --> 00:11:47,269
Pops already got me a good job
at the factory...

172
00:11:47,338 --> 00:11:50,535
- I always wanted an education for Harry.
- They got schools here.

173
00:11:50,608 --> 00:11:54,442
I don't feel comfortable
sending my boy that far away

174
00:11:54,512 --> 00:11:56,980
and trusting him to a stranger.

175
00:11:57,048 --> 00:12:02,418
I know. I understand. I will look
after him like he's one of my own.

176
00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:06,719
- You ate my pie.
- We're church people around here.

177
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,089
Are you?

178
00:12:13,364 --> 00:12:15,628
I won't lie.
I hadn't been to church in so long,

179
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:19,192
I can't remember
which day of the week it falls on.

180
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:22,535
I'm ashamed to say I'm... I'm just a wretch.

181
00:12:24,776 --> 00:12:25,765
Well...

182
00:12:25,844 --> 00:12:30,110
We all fall short.
And we're saved by grace.

183
00:12:30,181 --> 00:12:33,810
- Tell me more about El Paso.
- No, Mama. Mama, come on, now.

184
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:39,221
It's lovely, ma'am. It's right on the banks
of the Rio Grande. It's a little oasis.

185
00:12:42,227 --> 00:12:43,819
Nah.

186
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:45,522
- I got plenty of offers.
- Yeah?

187
00:12:45,597 --> 00:12:49,727
From who? Duke? Kansas?

188
00:12:51,436 --> 00:12:54,928
- I'm playing for the Globetrotters.
- It's probably for the best.

189
00:12:55,006 --> 00:12:59,807
You're better off with the Trotters
playing its team of patsies every night.

190
00:12:59,878 --> 00:13:05,441
You can't get past an average defender in
our league with that fancy dribble of yours.

191
00:13:05,517 --> 00:13:08,384
Man, no offense, but that's bull.

192
00:13:08,453 --> 00:13:10,978
Hey, brother, no offense,
but without work,

193
00:13:11,055 --> 00:13:13,922
I don't think you'd get past
a beat-up old-timer like me.

194
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:17,722
Get past you?

195
00:13:19,097 --> 00:13:23,431
I would go past you, through you,
over you, under you, around you.

196
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:26,231
As a matter of fact,
I'll spin you like a top,

197
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:29,933
eat your lunch, steal your girl
and kick your dog at the same time.

198
00:13:31,142 --> 00:13:32,336
Get past you.

199
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:36,744
- Come on, Orsten!
- Hey, come on.

200
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:37,839
Do your thang.

201
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,816
- You fouling me.
- You call that a foul?

202
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:42,819
My three year old calls that a love tap.

203
00:13:45,056 --> 00:13:46,887
Ooh! Come on, man.

204
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:49,654
Hey, hold it, hold it.

205
00:13:49,727 --> 00:13:52,924
You expect me to react to all
that head-shake and body gyration?

206
00:13:52,997 --> 00:13:55,488
It's activity without accomplishment.

207
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:59,230
You got the ball in front of you.
You ain't going anywhere without it.

208
00:13:59,304 --> 00:14:03,070
Try this. It's called a rocker step.
You ready? Get in your stance.

209
00:14:03,141 --> 00:14:05,268
OK?

210
00:14:05,343 --> 00:14:08,141
The difference between me and you
is I got the ball protected.

211
00:14:08,213 --> 00:14:11,512
It looks like I'm starting to dribble,
so you react, and when you do,

212
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:14,347
cross over, dribble right by you.

213
00:14:15,119 --> 00:14:20,785
Try it. It's simple, but it'll make
that pretty little shot of yours work.

214
00:14:26,097 --> 00:14:28,156
First time. There it is.

215
00:14:30,668 --> 00:14:32,397
Excuse me!

216
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:34,563
I'm looking for three guys. Uh...

217
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,665
Names of Nevil Shed,

218
00:14:37,742 --> 00:14:41,337
Willie Worsley and Willie Cager.

219
00:14:41,412 --> 00:14:43,846
They're colored boys.
You know them?

220
00:14:43,915 --> 00:14:46,383
- Did he say "colored"?
- He said what I think he did.

221
00:14:46,451 --> 00:14:47,611
Yeah.

222
00:14:47,685 --> 00:14:52,315
And I don't think he was talking
about no television set, neither.

223
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,085
He got a nice car.

224
00:14:54,158 --> 00:14:57,525
These New York kids may be
from the street, but they sure can play.

225
00:14:57,595 --> 00:14:59,358
Little guard plays like a giant.

226
00:14:59,430 --> 00:15:02,126
Forward runs like an antelope.
Never seen anything like him.

227
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,964
- How long till you can have 'em out?
- A week maybe.

228
00:15:05,036 --> 00:15:07,834
How's it with Lattin?
These boys play big, but they ain't big.

229
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:09,271
Hey!

230
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:11,934
You want me to fill this thing up?

231
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,171
I called his coach, but he run me off.

232
00:15:14,245 --> 00:15:16,713
I still got one more roll of these dice,
though.

233
00:15:16,781 --> 00:15:18,772
And one more little thing, Don.

234
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:20,943
I had a little misunderstanding here.

235
00:15:21,019 --> 00:15:23,749
Do you think you could wire me
another hundred dollars?

236
00:15:38,536 --> 00:15:41,164
Where on earth's this coach taking us?

237
00:15:41,239 --> 00:15:44,902
I don't think we're even
on earth anymore, brah.

238
00:15:44,976 --> 00:15:46,773
- Say, Willie.
- Yeah.

239
00:15:46,844 --> 00:15:48,744
- You got a dime?
- For what?

240
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,416
I gotta call my mama.
Tell her I'm an astronaut.

241
00:15:53,484 --> 00:15:55,884
Looks like we're the first black men
on the moon.

242
00:15:57,755 --> 00:16:00,053
What's this dead stuff
on the side of the road?

243
00:16:00,124 --> 00:16:03,218
Players from last year's team
trying to crawl back to New York.

244
00:16:03,294 --> 00:16:05,455
We driving into hell, plain and simple.

245
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:08,966
El Paso, Texas! Ain't no place like it.

246
00:16:09,400 --> 00:16:13,734
Big ol' west Texas sun shining down
about 330 days a year.

247
00:16:13,805 --> 00:16:15,830
Yes, sir, you're in God's country now.

248
00:16:15,907 --> 00:16:20,241
If this is God's country, obviously
the good Lord don't want no neighbors.

249
00:16:24,382 --> 00:16:27,249
Say, man,
this place looks like Bonanza.

250
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:30,845
Hey, look, just smile at 'em
and say "howdy."

251
00:16:30,922 --> 00:16:32,116
Howdy.

252
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,754
To him you gotta say "hole-ah."
Like this, see.

253
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:40,263
Hole-ah!

254
00:16:40,331 --> 00:16:44,427
- Man, what this "hole-ah" mean?
- It means, "Hello, Puerto Ricans."

255
00:16:44,502 --> 00:16:47,300
You've signed some black players, Don?

256
00:16:47,372 --> 00:16:48,600
That's right.

257
00:16:48,673 --> 00:16:51,107
Seven of them?

258
00:16:52,243 --> 00:16:56,839
I'm not sure that all the boosters
are gonna like it. All right?

259
00:16:56,914 --> 00:17:00,179
It's a little different
than what they're used to.

260
00:17:00,251 --> 00:17:03,084
You hired me to put a team together -
that's what I'm doing.

261
00:17:03,154 --> 00:17:05,714
No, Don.

262
00:17:05,790 --> 00:17:09,089
I hired you to ride herd
on the athletic dorm.

263
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:12,391
I've got a little more
than I bargained for.

264
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:16,230
Those our new teammates?

265
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,734
Ross said things
were gonna be different.

266
00:17:18,803 --> 00:17:21,795
Doesn't look like he was kidding.

267
00:17:21,873 --> 00:17:25,400
- I ain't never seen one of them before.
- One what?

268
00:17:25,476 --> 00:17:27,774
One of them - a colored.

269
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:29,745
You've gotta get off the farm more.

270
00:17:29,814 --> 00:17:33,545
I'll have some of that and some of this
and some of that.

271
00:17:33,618 --> 00:17:36,416
- Save a brother some scraps.
- Back off, midget.

272
00:17:36,487 --> 00:17:38,978
Who you calling midget?
You big-toothed clown.

273
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:41,890
Grab your red hat and lantern
and get back on the front lawn.

274
00:17:41,959 --> 00:17:43,984
I'll let you know
when the full-sized men are done eating.

275
00:17:44,062 --> 00:17:48,795
Easy, choppers. I seen Pontiacs with
smaller grilles than those teeth of yours.

276
00:17:48,866 --> 00:17:52,927
- Taco, nacho, burrito?
- No. I'm looking for hot dog-o.

277
00:17:53,004 --> 00:17:55,996
Taco, nacho, burrito?

278
00:17:56,074 --> 00:17:58,668
No, no. Hot dog-o.

279
00:17:58,743 --> 00:18:00,438
Hot dog-o.

280
00:18:00,511 --> 00:18:02,342
Nacho?

281
00:18:15,993 --> 00:18:20,930
What are you lookin' at?
Ain't you never seen a black man before?

282
00:18:23,067 --> 00:18:26,230
Yeah, I've seen plenty of folks like you.

283
00:18:28,606 --> 00:18:30,198
So, are you from Harlem?

284
00:18:30,274 --> 00:18:33,732
- You think all blacks are from Harlem?
- Are all of you from Mayberry?

285
00:18:33,811 --> 00:18:37,372
- Take it easy. He didn't mean nothin'.
- Mind your business, man.

286
00:18:37,448 --> 00:18:42,147
Hey, look, guys. My name's Togo Railey.
I'm from El Paso.

287
00:18:43,521 --> 00:18:45,614
Where y'all from?

288
00:18:49,594 --> 00:18:52,154
Bobby Joe Hill, from Detroit.

289
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:56,360
Yeah, I'm Willie Cager, South Bronx.

290
00:18:56,434 --> 00:18:58,425
Forward.

291
00:19:00,338 --> 00:19:05,298
Jerry Armstrong, Eagleville, Missouri.
All-State, 19 boards a game.

292
00:19:05,376 --> 00:19:07,571
Starting forward.

293
00:19:11,682 --> 00:19:13,013
Whoo!

294
00:19:13,084 --> 00:19:15,348
- Go, Miners.
- That's it, Jerry.

295
00:19:16,187 --> 00:19:18,382
Harry Flournoy.

296
00:19:18,456 --> 00:19:20,356
Gary, Indiana.

297
00:19:20,424 --> 00:19:23,291
United Steel Mill day shift.

298
00:19:23,361 --> 00:19:25,955
The starting forward.

299
00:19:33,604 --> 00:19:35,435
Back to the cows, Jethro.

300
00:19:35,506 --> 00:19:38,998
Come on, Flournoy, get that.
Get it, Flournoy. Get it, get it!

301
00:19:39,076 --> 00:19:40,168
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

302
00:19:45,616 --> 00:19:48,107
Throw the ball, come on!

303
00:19:57,295 --> 00:20:01,994
- Hey, hold the basket still, bite-size.
- Orsten, shut your tusk! Cager! Cager!

304
00:20:02,066 --> 00:20:03,863
Get off me.

305
00:20:06,137 --> 00:20:09,300
Cager! Cager!
Downtown, Willie, take it downtown!

306
00:20:09,373 --> 00:20:11,136
Oh!

307
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:14,645
- You moved the basket!
- Advantage black man, for once.

308
00:20:14,712 --> 00:20:16,646
What? What, farm boy? What?

309
00:20:16,714 --> 00:20:19,945
Hold up! Get over here!

310
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:24,049
This is just another example
that knuckleheads

311
00:20:24,121 --> 00:20:27,488
come in all sizes, shapes and colors.

312
00:20:27,558 --> 00:20:29,890
You're pitiful. Pitiful!

313
00:20:30,761 --> 00:20:34,424
Messing around down here
like a bunch of kindergarten kids.

314
00:20:34,498 --> 00:20:38,332
Now, you get this place cleaned up
and try to act like you got some sense.

315
00:20:38,402 --> 00:20:41,496
- You think you can do that?
- Yeah.

316
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:52,078
You son of a gun. You got David Lattin
to come here and play basketball.

317
00:20:52,149 --> 00:20:53,343
It's David Lattin.

318
00:20:56,354 --> 00:20:57,946
I used to read about him in the paper.

319
00:20:58,022 --> 00:21:01,458
How in the world did you swing that?

320
00:21:08,766 --> 00:21:11,030
How you doin', brother?

321
00:21:14,605 --> 00:21:17,335
Should have left your hand out.
Might have gave ya a tip.

322
00:21:17,408 --> 00:21:20,377
Man, I'll bust that big ox
upside his head.

323
00:21:20,444 --> 00:21:22,878
Worsley.
You know it'd take three men your size

324
00:21:22,947 --> 00:21:25,973
to rip that boy's picture in half.

325
00:21:35,259 --> 00:21:38,888
My old man wants me working
on that farm.

326
00:21:38,963 --> 00:21:42,729
He thinks playing basketball
is a waste of time.

327
00:21:45,803 --> 00:21:47,794
I think different.

328
00:21:47,872 --> 00:21:50,272
- You the new players?
- Yeah, that's right.

329
00:21:50,341 --> 00:21:53,640
- You don't look like much to me, guys.
- Whoa, whoa. Easy, bro.

330
00:21:53,711 --> 00:21:56,737
- You lookin' at the new Mighty Miners.
- Mighty Miners?

331
00:21:56,814 --> 00:22:00,841
You're at a hole-digging college.
A commuter school.

332
00:22:00,918 --> 00:22:05,548
Playing for a girls' basketball coach.
The Mighty Miners. Ha-ha!

333
00:22:05,623 --> 00:22:07,614
That's funny.

334
00:22:09,493 --> 00:22:12,428
What is he talking about,
girls' basketball coach?

335
00:22:12,496 --> 00:22:17,593
You're here to learn fundamental,
disciplined defensive basketball.

336
00:22:17,668 --> 00:22:21,900
Now, that means discipline
both on and off the court.

337
00:22:21,972 --> 00:22:23,963
No girls.

338
00:22:24,041 --> 00:22:26,532
No booze. No late nights.

339
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:29,943
Nothing besides fundamental basketball.

340
00:22:31,382 --> 00:22:34,681
I speak, you listen.

341
00:22:34,752 --> 00:22:38,518
I don't wanna hear "can't" or "won't"
or "Coach, I'm bleeding."

342
00:22:38,589 --> 00:22:42,821
I don't wanna hear anything
except the basketball bounce.

343
00:22:44,395 --> 00:22:49,059
You play basketball my way.
My way's hard.

344
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:52,432
Especially if your guard's wearing a skirt.

345
00:22:54,805 --> 00:22:57,740
What's the matter?
You got mud on your feet?

346
00:22:57,808 --> 00:23:02,006
Move those feet! Get down, get low, son!
Come on, come on!

347
00:23:02,079 --> 00:23:05,207
Now, we do not play defense standing up!
Get your butt down!

348
00:23:05,282 --> 00:23:08,410
Lower! Make it uncomfortable!
There you go.

349
00:23:11,088 --> 00:23:13,682
What's the matter, son?
Your skirt bothering ya?

350
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:17,626
Come on, come on, Lattin, go hard!
Lock him down.

351
00:23:17,695 --> 00:23:18,889
You in my office!

352
00:23:18,963 --> 00:23:22,023
Shed, what was that?
You let him put his armpits in the rim.

353
00:23:22,099 --> 00:23:23,726
Are you kiddin' me?

354
00:23:23,801 --> 00:23:27,828
We do not back down here, ever!

355
00:23:27,905 --> 00:23:30,430
You own this part of the court!

356
00:23:30,508 --> 00:23:33,204
And, Lattin, I said no dunking.

357
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:36,346
Now, let's do it again, come on.

358
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:39,212
Nice shot, big man.

359
00:23:39,283 --> 00:23:41,843
Excuse me, Wilt. Big ox.

360
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:45,480
Keep your hand out there a little
longer. Somebody might give you a tip.

361
00:23:45,556 --> 00:23:50,459
Shed, what's up? You looking like Lattin's
shadow out here. Big guy like you scared.

362
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:53,861
Not as scared as you when I come after
you with a fly swatter, ya leprechaun.

363
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:48,612
Don't touch my stuff, brother.

364
00:24:48,686 --> 00:24:51,450
Leave that to the big boys.

365
00:24:51,522 --> 00:24:55,856
Probably ain't even heard of the Panthers
back in Indiana.

366
00:24:55,926 --> 00:24:58,292
- Man, I know about 'em.

367
00:24:58,362 --> 00:25:01,763
It's one thing to know about 'em.
It's another to live the life.

368
00:25:01,832 --> 00:25:04,801
Well, I don't need a book
to live a life.

369
00:25:05,703 --> 00:25:08,763
Brothers! Mm.
We crossin' the bridge tonight.

370
00:25:09,907 --> 00:25:13,274
I hear Juarez is jumpin'
with some fine gals.

371
00:25:13,344 --> 00:25:17,007
What are you gonna do when you find
'em, fool? You don't speak Español.

372
00:25:17,081 --> 00:25:20,744
- This don't need no translation.
- Coach Haskins set the rules.

373
00:25:20,818 --> 00:25:25,152
He has his rules, I got mine. Rule number
one: Let's get into some trouble.

374
00:25:25,222 --> 00:25:28,885
- Come on!
- Willie Worsley needs the ladies.

375
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:33,828
- Better be some girls there too, brother.
- You don't know what to do with 'em.

376
00:25:33,898 --> 00:25:36,731
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

377
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:37,994
Peace, brother.

378
00:25:38,068 --> 00:25:40,730
- You know we got practice in the a.m.
- Well, good.

379
00:25:40,804 --> 00:25:43,967
You stay here
and you get a good headstart.

380
00:26:04,295 --> 00:26:09,756
- I'm going back. Somebody come with me.
- Hey, relax, Shed. Just smile.

381
00:26:09,833 --> 00:26:11,994
Everybody try to look Mexican.

382
00:26:12,069 --> 00:26:14,128
I'm six foot three.

383
00:26:14,204 --> 00:26:18,834
Try to look like three Mexicans, then.
How you doin'? All right.

384
00:26:28,886 --> 00:26:31,377
- Worsley, you next.
- No, no, no, no.

385
00:26:31,455 --> 00:26:35,084
Elijah Muhammad and the Black Muslims
say that liquor steals a man's mind.

386
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:38,287
Man, Elijah Muhammad never played
for a crazy white man.

387
00:26:38,362 --> 00:26:41,229
Excuse me, señor. Señor?

388
00:26:41,298 --> 00:26:44,233
You mind fillin' this shot glass up
with some cold water?

389
00:26:44,301 --> 00:26:47,031
My man Worsley wants to take a swim.

390
00:26:48,272 --> 00:26:49,864
Oh! Oh!

391
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:55,767
Seriously, I'm not busting
my butt out there for him anymore.

392
00:26:55,846 --> 00:26:58,838
They're using us,
so I'm gonna use 'em right back.

393
00:26:58,916 --> 00:27:00,975
Education is the key, guys.

394
00:27:01,585 --> 00:27:03,712
Blah, blah, blah.

395
00:27:03,787 --> 00:27:06,585
Hey, hey. Educate this.

396
00:27:07,291 --> 00:27:09,657
- Hey, sweet thing.
- Gracias.

397
00:27:10,361 --> 00:27:12,022
What's your name?

398
00:27:12,096 --> 00:27:15,827
Why do you need to know my name?
You ain't gonna be usin' it.

399
00:27:15,899 --> 00:27:18,094
You all business tonight?

400
00:27:18,168 --> 00:27:21,433
Looks like a cold night
in Mexico for you, boy.

401
00:27:22,573 --> 00:27:24,370
Doing OK, Tina?

402
00:27:24,441 --> 00:27:29,037
Hey, listen.
I was just playing with you back there.

403
00:27:29,113 --> 00:27:31,581
My name is Bobby Joe.

404
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:34,845
My friends call me Bobby Joe.

405
00:27:34,918 --> 00:27:38,445
Tina.
And I go to the same school you do.

406
00:27:38,522 --> 00:27:42,515
And I'm not about to fall
for that smooth-talking Negro routine.

407
00:27:42,593 --> 00:27:45,960
- My mama warned me about you.
- Your mama don't even know me.

408
00:27:46,030 --> 00:27:50,399
She said watch out for pretty boys
with big smiles, worn shoes,

409
00:27:50,467 --> 00:27:52,560
and single dollars in their pockets.

410
00:27:52,636 --> 00:27:57,164
Well, that's not me.
I'm telling you, you got me all wrong.

411
00:28:15,759 --> 00:28:17,750
Cómo estás. Everybody?

412
00:28:19,763 --> 00:28:22,698
What was that, son?
I didn't get that.

413
00:28:25,035 --> 00:28:28,596
How is everybody today?
Feeling all right?

414
00:28:28,672 --> 00:28:30,833
You OK, Bobby Joe?

415
00:28:34,344 --> 00:28:37,609
Hey, I hear you speak Spanish, right?

416
00:28:37,681 --> 00:28:40,673
- Sir?
- I'm just wondering.

417
00:28:40,751 --> 00:28:46,348
You looking a little tired. All that fancy
footwork of yours tire you out yesterday?

418
00:28:46,423 --> 00:28:48,914
Or was it something else?

419
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:53,227
Now, because some of you were bitten
by the evil worm last night,

420
00:28:53,297 --> 00:28:56,357
this morning, all of you are gonna run.

421
00:28:56,433 --> 00:29:00,096
- The evil worm never bit me!
- Hundred lines! Let's do it! Let's sprint!

422
00:29:00,170 --> 00:29:02,900
Lattin, get to the baseline, son.

423
00:29:05,375 --> 00:29:08,105
Y'all are gonna burn holes
in your shoes today!

424
00:29:08,178 --> 00:29:13,946
You look like you're running in mud, son!
Are you kiddin' me? Are you kiddin' me?

425
00:29:14,017 --> 00:29:16,747
Hill, get your butt down.

426
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:22,019
There's 31 days before the season starts,
and you're gonna run every one of 'em.

427
00:29:22,693 --> 00:29:25,218
Oh, that was pretty.
Hey, that was real pretty.

428
00:29:25,295 --> 00:29:29,254
Everybody see that behind-the-back?
The circus has come to town.

429
00:29:29,333 --> 00:29:31,733
- What are you doing?
- I'm just playing my game.

430
00:29:31,802 --> 00:29:35,704
We're playing my game here.
All that other stuff's just insecurity.

431
00:29:35,773 --> 00:29:43,475
Great players make simple, basic,
easy plays. Showboating's just insecurity.

432
00:29:44,314 --> 00:29:47,306
He didn't want us playing our game?
Why'd he bring us here?

433
00:29:47,384 --> 00:29:51,047
- Man, I'm sick of him riding my butt.
- I don't need this, man!

434
00:29:51,121 --> 00:29:54,249
- You know what I'm sayin'?
- Yes, you do.

435
00:30:00,731 --> 00:30:04,223
This ain't basketball. You killing us!

436
00:30:04,301 --> 00:30:08,635
Well, from where I'm standing,
you don't got much to bargain with.

437
00:30:08,705 --> 00:30:10,605
What?

438
00:30:11,642 --> 00:30:13,667
You wanna quit?

439
00:30:14,945 --> 00:30:17,243
You wanna quit?

440
00:30:17,314 --> 00:30:21,944
You quit right now,
you'll quit every day the rest of your life.

441
00:30:31,161 --> 00:30:32,185
Watch.

442
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:01,150
Don't worry.
Gunsmoke wasn't that good tonight.

443
00:31:01,225 --> 00:31:03,284
How was the practice?

444
00:31:05,929 --> 00:31:08,227
That good, huh?

445
00:31:08,832 --> 00:31:12,825
Come on! Move those feet!
Move the ball, faster! Faster!

446
00:31:15,205 --> 00:31:17,332
Get off me, farm boy.

447
00:31:17,407 --> 00:31:20,376
- Quit your crying, Harlem.
- I told you I wasn't from Harlem!

448
00:31:20,444 --> 00:31:22,935
Knock it off! Knock it...

449
00:31:23,013 --> 00:31:26,813
Knock it off! Knock it off!
Knock it off! Knock it off!

450
00:31:26,884 --> 00:31:30,342
You'd done that in a game,
it'd be a technical foul for fighting.

451
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:33,514
Both of you'd be ejected.
Probably cost us the game, son.

452
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:37,287
Baseline, everybody. Y'all gonna run
'cause of their selfishness.

453
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:39,886
Two weeks before the game,
and you still don't listen.

454
00:31:39,963 --> 00:31:44,229
Class, make sure can you identify
all the minerals in your boxes.

455
00:31:44,301 --> 00:31:49,705
I'll be passing around to your stations,
so if you have any problems, let me know.

456
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:01,646
This team does not play playground ball.

457
00:32:01,718 --> 00:32:05,916
We play fundamental, disciplined
defensive basketball.

458
00:32:05,989 --> 00:32:08,924
Togo? Hey, show Mr. Cager
how to make a shot.

459
00:32:13,263 --> 00:32:15,629
There you go.

460
00:32:18,101 --> 00:32:20,194
- You want me to do that?
- Mm-hm.

461
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:24,036
Come on, Coach. What about my stylin'?
I got way too much style to do that.

462
00:32:24,107 --> 00:32:29,477
You leave the styling for the barber shop.
Just show me you belong in the NCAA.

463
00:32:36,053 --> 00:32:38,419
OK, guys.

464
00:32:47,164 --> 00:32:49,098
You're a smart kid, Harry.

465
00:32:49,166 --> 00:32:51,828
But these grades ain't pulling the truck
up the hill.

466
00:32:51,902 --> 00:32:55,929
It's just that every class is about rocks,
and I'm a black man. I don't do rocks.

467
00:32:56,006 --> 00:32:57,337
Mm-hm.

468
00:32:57,407 --> 00:33:01,571
You got two weeks to get your grades up.
Or else.

469
00:33:01,645 --> 00:33:03,943
- You hear me?
- Yes, sir.

470
00:33:06,817 --> 00:33:08,580
- How'd it go?
- What's he gonna do?

471
00:33:08,652 --> 00:33:11,314
He's already run our asses ragged.

472
00:33:13,690 --> 00:33:15,157
She's a great girl.

473
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,025
Mm! What's that girl?

474
00:33:21,198 --> 00:33:22,893
- Is she cute?
- No.

475
00:33:22,966 --> 00:33:25,935
- Yeah.
- She's a cutie pie, but she's not cute.

476
00:33:35,846 --> 00:33:40,078
Who can tell me the field classification
of phaneritic rocks?

477
00:33:40,150 --> 00:33:42,277
My son Harry can.

478
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:43,908
Yes, ma'am.

479
00:33:43,987 --> 00:33:47,923
- Granite, syenite and gabbro.

480
00:33:47,991 --> 00:33:50,289
Can anybody tell me
how they are formed?

481
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:53,329
Yes, ma'am. Harry can.

482
00:33:55,665 --> 00:33:58,532
- By slow cooling plutons?
- And what is a pluton?

483
00:33:58,602 --> 00:34:00,297
Harry.

484
00:34:01,238 --> 00:34:05,868
It is a deep-seated igneous intrusion
with no visible floor.

485
00:34:05,942 --> 00:34:07,170
Very good, Harry.

486
00:34:11,448 --> 00:34:13,439
You know I love you, but...

487
00:34:13,517 --> 00:34:15,985
Nah, I can't. I can't do that. Not again.

488
00:34:16,053 --> 00:34:19,853
Please, baby.
Don't make me do it again. Please.

489
00:34:35,305 --> 00:34:36,329
Ah!

490
00:34:36,406 --> 00:34:38,966
Don't ever enter
when I'm entertaining a lady friend!

491
00:34:39,042 --> 00:34:40,873
- I didn't know.
- Check that vent!

492
00:34:40,944 --> 00:34:44,607
I told you when that vent's open,
it's too hot for you to come in here.

493
00:34:44,681 --> 00:34:47,047
- Hey, man, cool down, man.
- You dig?

494
00:34:47,117 --> 00:34:49,347
OK. OK.

495
00:35:01,298 --> 00:35:02,629
Shed.

496
00:35:02,699 --> 00:35:04,826
- Come on, brother.
- Here we go now.

497
00:35:04,901 --> 00:35:06,926
Can't be good for his back.

498
00:35:08,071 --> 00:35:09,231
Shed.

499
00:35:09,306 --> 00:35:11,638
Have you even slept
in your bed yet?

500
00:35:11,708 --> 00:35:15,405
Hey, it's time for practice.
You've been sleeping out here all night.

501
00:35:15,479 --> 00:35:18,073
Rise and shine. Like you used to it.

502
00:35:20,984 --> 00:35:24,215
Here, man. Go buy yourself a hot dog-o.

503
00:35:35,899 --> 00:35:38,424
Gimme your base. Balls of your feet.

504
00:35:38,502 --> 00:35:40,993
Get your arms up. Get your arms up.
There you go.

505
00:35:47,878 --> 00:35:53,316
I know I told you not to dunk, but if he's
playing that weak, slam it down his throat.

506
00:35:53,383 --> 00:35:57,376
You know what, Shed? You're like a duck.
You wake up in a new world every day.

507
00:35:57,454 --> 00:36:00,321
Waitress down at Dairy Queen's
tougher than you are.

508
00:36:00,390 --> 00:36:05,259
All right. Hey, move your feet.
Come on, get back to the practice.

509
00:36:06,763 --> 00:36:11,928
- Well, there's seven of them.
- Actually, there's 12 in all.

510
00:36:12,002 --> 00:36:15,631
Yeah, but seven of the other ones.

511
00:36:26,049 --> 00:36:28,017
Coach...

512
00:36:28,084 --> 00:36:30,518
You're going home.

513
00:36:31,521 --> 00:36:33,512
Home? What are you talking about?

514
00:36:33,590 --> 00:36:36,388
Too afraid to rebound and defend.
You're too soft.

515
00:36:36,459 --> 00:36:39,485
- That's why I'm sending you home.
- Ah, come on! No!

516
00:36:39,563 --> 00:36:42,896
The season's two days away.
You can't send me home!

517
00:36:42,966 --> 00:36:46,231
I can't have a big man
that's afraid to play like one.

518
00:36:46,303 --> 00:36:48,430
- No.
- There's your ticket.

519
00:36:51,141 --> 00:36:53,473
Coach. Please!

520
00:36:53,543 --> 00:36:57,411
I'll never be able to look my daddy
in the eye again! Coach!

521
00:37:15,265 --> 00:37:18,894
Look at those moves! Look at how
he slices the defense! He's unstoppable!

522
00:37:18,969 --> 00:37:21,733
Look at that jump shot!

523
00:37:22,839 --> 00:37:25,933
It's all good! Roy, it's all good!

524
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:29,576
The crowd goes wild, Roy.

525
00:37:45,595 --> 00:37:48,155
You spilled a lot of sweat on this floor,

526
00:37:48,231 --> 00:37:50,495
and it's gonna pay off.

527
00:37:50,567 --> 00:37:53,400
Now, I know it seems
I've been hard on you for no reason.

528
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:57,531
But I've been tough
because I know how good you can be.

529
00:37:57,607 --> 00:38:01,976
People outside this gym, they don't think
we got a chance this season,

530
00:38:02,045 --> 00:38:04,878
playing with players
none of the big schools wanted.

531
00:38:04,948 --> 00:38:08,611
But those people don't know you. I do.

532
00:38:08,685 --> 00:38:11,711
You're talented. You're disciplined.

533
00:38:11,788 --> 00:38:14,382
And you care about the guy
standing next to you.

534
00:38:14,457 --> 00:38:17,187
That's how we're gonna win,
starting tomorrow night.

535
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:21,424
So let's go out there
and let's play Texas Western basketball.

536
00:38:22,132 --> 00:38:24,760
Let's make that mean something.

537
00:38:27,003 --> 00:38:28,994
On three.

538
00:38:30,507 --> 00:38:32,475
One, two, three.

539
00:38:32,542 --> 00:38:34,305
Miners!

540
00:38:34,377 --> 00:38:36,072
All right, all right.

541
00:38:36,146 --> 00:38:39,445
- Let's go, quick. Come on.
- Here we go.

542
00:38:39,516 --> 00:38:43,475
- What are you still doing here, Shed?
- I'm... I'm ready to play.

543
00:38:43,553 --> 00:38:47,683
Well, you had your chance to be a man.
Now, go on. Take your ticket and go home.

544
00:38:47,757 --> 00:38:51,420
- Come on, man, let me play.
- I can't. You might get hurt.

545
00:38:51,494 --> 00:38:54,258
Let me play!

546
00:38:54,331 --> 00:38:58,028
Come on, come on, come on!
I don't care how tired you are.

547
00:39:01,571 --> 00:39:03,630
That's the way to play.

548
00:39:06,509 --> 00:39:09,501
Let me look at that. Come here
and let me look at that! Hold on.

549
00:39:09,579 --> 00:39:11,604
- I'm all right.
- I know you're OK.

550
00:39:11,681 --> 00:39:15,947
You're walking, but your nose ain't in
good shape. You're getting blood all over.

551
00:39:16,019 --> 00:39:19,978
- I'm all right.
- Hold your head back. You're bleeding.

552
00:39:20,056 --> 00:39:22,490
All right, let's play. Come on.

553
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:30,356
Quit hopping around like a jack rabbit.
I said rotate in.

554
00:39:33,303 --> 00:39:35,965
You a catcher now?

555
00:39:38,341 --> 00:39:43,677
- Ain't nothing gonna stop me from playing.
- He won't go to the doctor, Coach.

556
00:39:43,747 --> 00:39:47,615
That's right. I'm not going anywhere.
I'm here to stay.

557
00:39:48,585 --> 00:39:54,023
Just go get your nose taken care of.
We're gonna need ya this season, all right?

558
00:39:54,090 --> 00:39:56,217
There you go, Nevil.

559
00:40:05,301 --> 00:40:10,898
Hi again. Everybody. This is Judd Milton.
The voice of the Miners on KTSM 1380.

560
00:40:10,974 --> 00:40:12,771
Welcome. It's our home opener.

561
00:40:12,842 --> 00:40:17,404
And we're hosting the Greyhounds
of Eastern New Mexico State College.

562
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:19,471
This is a night of questions.

563
00:40:19,549 --> 00:40:24,452
Will Don Haskins, the little-known coach
of the Benjamin High School girls' team,

564
00:40:24,521 --> 00:40:26,785
be able to lift the Miners
to respectability?

565
00:40:26,856 --> 00:40:28,016
- Let me see.
- Let go!

566
00:40:28,091 --> 00:40:29,854
- What?
- Don't touch it, man.

567
00:40:29,926 --> 00:40:31,553
Hey, man. Where were you?

568
00:40:31,628 --> 00:40:35,621
It was a late night,
if y'all know what I mean.

569
00:40:35,698 --> 00:40:38,098
Are you ever gonna straighten up, man?

570
00:40:38,168 --> 00:40:40,466
Somebody say something?

571
00:40:40,537 --> 00:40:44,064
And now your Texas Western Miners!

572
00:40:51,047 --> 00:40:55,882
At guard.
El Paso's own David Palacio!

573
00:40:55,952 --> 00:41:00,616
At forward, from Eagleville, Missouri,
Jerry Armstrong!

574
00:41:01,925 --> 00:41:06,555
At guard. From Detroit. Michigan.
Bobby Joe Hill!

575
00:41:09,732 --> 00:41:14,726
At forward. From Gary. Indiana.
Harry Flournoy!

576
00:41:17,707 --> 00:41:23,907
And in center. From Houston. Texas.
David "Big Daddy D" Lattin!

577
00:41:26,616 --> 00:41:30,643
Three of 'em, Wallace. They look like
the damn Tuskegee Institute out there.

578
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:33,655
Just when did we become
a colored school?

579
00:41:33,723 --> 00:41:35,987
... your 1965 Texas Western Miners!

580
00:41:39,529 --> 00:41:41,690
The Miners win the tip-off
to start the season.

581
00:41:41,764 --> 00:41:44,699
- Go, Hill. Set it up. Take your time.
- Set it up!

582
00:41:49,372 --> 00:41:51,363
Hey, protect the ball.

583
00:41:52,041 --> 00:41:54,100
Not a good start for the Miners.

584
00:41:54,177 --> 00:41:57,772
Hey, Hill, you notice your man
just scored on you?

585
00:41:57,847 --> 00:41:59,610
Mitch, over here, over here!

586
00:41:59,682 --> 00:42:02,879
- Hill spins to the basket. Puts it up for two!
- Stop showboating!

587
00:42:02,952 --> 00:42:06,786
Fundamental basketball, Hill.
Watch your base.

588
00:42:06,856 --> 00:42:09,689
You didn't have a base -
that's how he went around you.

589
00:42:09,759 --> 00:42:15,220
Coach Haskins trying to mold these guys
into team players... Cager for two.

590
00:42:15,298 --> 00:42:17,960
Cager, just lay the ball off the board.

591
00:42:21,037 --> 00:42:24,495
Get your hand in his face, son!
You gotta challenge that shot.

592
00:42:24,574 --> 00:42:27,042
Right here, over here. Shoot it.

593
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:29,704
Where's the D? There ain't no D.

594
00:42:30,914 --> 00:42:33,144
Hill wheelin' and dealin'.
The ball's loose!

595
00:42:33,216 --> 00:42:36,014
- That's why I don't want you showboating.
- Let's go!

596
00:42:36,085 --> 00:42:39,020
Hey, Armstrong. Hey, Flournoy.
Are you kiddin' me?

597
00:42:39,088 --> 00:42:42,319
Lattin, you're ankle-deep in the floor, son.

598
00:42:42,392 --> 00:42:44,860
Drive that ball! There it is!

599
00:42:48,898 --> 00:42:50,092
Hey, I saw it, son.

600
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:52,396
And the Miners lead by four.

601
00:42:53,169 --> 00:42:54,727
They need one stop now.

602
00:42:54,804 --> 00:42:57,671
Good defense, Armstrong!
Good defense!

603
00:42:57,740 --> 00:43:02,074
So the Don Haskins era begins
in victory. A four-point win

604
00:43:02,145 --> 00:43:05,205
over a less-than-impressive squad
from Eastern New Mexico.

605
00:43:05,281 --> 00:43:07,010
But the real story tonight -

606
00:43:07,083 --> 00:43:11,042
Coach Haskins putting three Negro
players into the starting lineup -

607
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:15,420
a move that's sure to stir things up
both on and off the court this season.

608
00:43:39,549 --> 00:43:43,280
- You've got all the moves, don't you?
- Oh, yeah.

609
00:43:43,353 --> 00:43:45,583
Tried it on a hundred girls?

610
00:43:45,655 --> 00:43:46,952
Ah...

611
00:43:47,023 --> 00:43:49,491
Maybe 50 or 60.

612
00:43:53,096 --> 00:43:57,556
I'm tired of moving around.
I just wanna stay in one place for a while.

613
00:43:57,634 --> 00:44:02,594
Put down some roots for once.
You got what it takes, Bobby Joe?

614
00:44:24,794 --> 00:44:28,025
- Hey, Coach, I can't go no more!
- I think you can go some more.

615
00:44:28,097 --> 00:44:31,794
You got energy for all kind of nonsense
instead of putting it in your team!

616
00:44:31,868 --> 00:44:34,996
Instead of demonstrating some respect
and being a leader!

617
00:44:35,071 --> 00:44:37,062
I ain't got no team!

618
00:44:37,140 --> 00:44:40,439
We ain't going nowhere! You telling us
all the time how bad we are!

619
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:44,606
We know we ain't gonna win!
What do I got to respect?

620
00:44:52,689 --> 00:44:56,455
My old man drove a truck
for the better half of his life.

621
00:44:56,526 --> 00:45:00,860
Now, there ain't nothing wrong with that...
other than the fact he hated it.

622
00:45:00,930 --> 00:45:03,524
That's the only way he knew
how to put food on the table

623
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:07,933
and give his kids a chance
to do something they loved.

624
00:45:08,004 --> 00:45:11,701
I love this game. I love this game.

625
00:45:12,675 --> 00:45:14,870
I never was the greatest player.

626
00:45:14,944 --> 00:45:19,347
But I busted my butt,
and I outworked better players.

627
00:45:19,415 --> 00:45:23,909
I ain't the smartest coach, but I bust
my butt and I outwork smarter coaches.

628
00:45:23,986 --> 00:45:29,947
And when I see the talent you got
and I see you wasting it, ticks me off.

629
00:45:30,026 --> 00:45:35,328
Now, if you couldn't get in the gym,
if you didn't have the opportunity,

630
00:45:35,398 --> 00:45:37,662
there'd be nothing for us to talk about,

631
00:45:37,734 --> 00:45:41,830
but, son, I've been there.
Times are different. You're in the gym.

632
00:45:41,904 --> 00:45:46,341
And if you're in the gym, you step out on
that floor, you better respect my father, me,

633
00:45:46,409 --> 00:45:50,812
and you better respect yourself
and play some basketball.

634
00:45:53,449 --> 00:45:56,009
Midway through the first half.
Iowa playing well.

635
00:45:56,085 --> 00:46:01,387
Of course. That's to be expected. They're
undefeated. Number four in the country.

636
00:46:03,893 --> 00:46:08,353
Iowa. Always a contender in the Big Ten.
And there's a bucket for the Hawkeyes.

637
00:46:08,431 --> 00:46:12,629
Coach Haskins is not happy.
It's an eight-point game right now.

638
00:46:13,936 --> 00:46:16,234
Hey! Tighten up out there!

639
00:46:18,641 --> 00:46:20,404
Stay on him! Stay on him!

640
00:46:20,476 --> 00:46:23,036
Shed, box out! Shed!

641
00:46:24,447 --> 00:46:29,544
- Count the bucket.
- Shed, would you box out?

642
00:46:30,386 --> 00:46:33,446
That's it! We got 'em now.

643
00:46:33,523 --> 00:46:37,619
Texas Western struggling to score
against this tough Hawkeyes' defense.

644
00:46:37,693 --> 00:46:40,025
And there's a great block
just before the half.

645
00:46:41,230 --> 00:46:45,894
I've seen a lot of rough halves in
basketball. But the Miners are struggling.

646
00:46:45,968 --> 00:46:49,836
They'll go to the locker room
down by 16 points.

647
00:46:50,706 --> 00:46:54,335
Say it, Hill.
Come on, Hill, say it.

648
00:46:54,410 --> 00:46:59,109
We can't play like this!
They're better than us at your game.

649
00:46:59,182 --> 00:47:01,650
You need to let us loose!

650
00:47:01,717 --> 00:47:04,481
Just stick to the plan, Bobby Joe.

651
00:47:04,554 --> 00:47:07,717
You want fundamental basketball, right?

652
00:47:11,194 --> 00:47:15,858
Iowa is just flat outplaying Texas
Western. It's been a difficult game so far.

653
00:47:15,932 --> 00:47:18,696
Ain't our night, Coach.

654
00:47:18,768 --> 00:47:21,566
Hey, Hill. Time-out.
Time, time, time!

655
00:47:21,637 --> 00:47:23,537
Time-out, white.

656
00:47:25,675 --> 00:47:27,506
Coach...

657
00:47:29,345 --> 00:47:32,143
if you let us play our game.

658
00:47:37,587 --> 00:47:41,887
All right, Hill, you play your game.
And you play my game.

659
00:47:43,759 --> 00:47:46,489
- You ready to play?
- Yeah, let's do it.

660
00:47:54,971 --> 00:47:58,463
And the Miners have a couple of baskets
back to back.

661
00:47:58,541 --> 00:48:00,532
Still. Though. A huge deficit.

662
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:09,145
Orsten Artis with a steal. Bounce pass to
Bobby Joe Hill. He drives it in for two!

663
00:48:09,218 --> 00:48:13,587
Well. The Miners have really turned it up
a notch defensively.

664
00:48:16,993 --> 00:48:19,757
Now it looks like Iowa is the team
that's struggling.

665
00:48:19,829 --> 00:48:23,196
This full-court pressure by the Miners
has the Hawkeyes rattled.

666
00:48:23,266 --> 00:48:25,530
Go to the basket! Go!

667
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:47,415
The comeback is on. 59-48.
Iowa still with the lead.

668
00:48:47,490 --> 00:48:49,458
Come on, son.

669
00:48:49,525 --> 00:48:50,719
Bring us home.

670
00:48:57,266 --> 00:48:59,097
Defense! Defense!

671
00:49:10,613 --> 00:49:11,602
There it is.

672
00:49:16,018 --> 00:49:17,007
Yeah!

673
00:49:17,086 --> 00:49:23,082
Down 16 at the half. Texas Western
has clawed their way back into this game!

674
00:49:25,194 --> 00:49:30,757
Miners trail by one with 15 seconds left
in the game. They have a shot to win this.

675
00:49:30,833 --> 00:49:33,529
Hill! Hill! Nine, nine!

676
00:49:33,602 --> 00:49:35,502
Spread their D! Their D!

677
00:49:36,505 --> 00:49:39,167
Hill goes down the middle.
Looks right. Nothing there.

678
00:49:39,241 --> 00:49:41,334
Looks left.
He's gonna try it himself!

679
00:49:41,410 --> 00:49:44,504
He is swarmed by Hawkeyes.
Splits the defense. Puts it up!

680
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:47,140
And it's good! Miners win!

681
00:49:47,216 --> 00:49:51,152
Miners win! I'm seeing it with
my own eyes and I still don't believe it!

682
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:54,656
The Miners take down
perennial powerhouse Iowa.

683
00:49:54,724 --> 00:49:58,922
Number four in the nation and the first
top-ranked team we have faced all year!

684
00:49:58,995 --> 00:50:01,327
These Miners are for real!

685
00:50:04,867 --> 00:50:07,301
You were playing tonight,
not acting like a chump.

686
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:09,930
I'm never a chump.
I was always a player.

687
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:11,974
My man.

688
00:50:12,041 --> 00:50:14,532
Douse the fire and call in the dogs!

689
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:18,444
Whoever heard of Texas Western?
Well, the Hawkeyes have.

690
00:50:37,066 --> 00:50:39,193
- Y'all going to church?
- Shh!

691
00:50:39,268 --> 00:50:41,532
Shut up.

692
00:50:47,376 --> 00:50:49,173
Why we got these honkies with us?

693
00:50:49,245 --> 00:50:51,907
Yeah, what are you honkies doing here?

694
00:50:51,981 --> 00:50:54,245
Hey, man.
We got more in the car behind us too.

695
00:50:54,316 --> 00:50:56,648
- What are you doin' up front?
- Calm down.

696
00:50:56,719 --> 00:50:57,879
Hey! Don't...

697
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:10,425
Big Daddy's home, baby.

698
00:51:10,966 --> 00:51:12,160
Hi.

699
00:51:37,593 --> 00:51:40,084
Baudoin! Man, you something else!

700
00:51:40,162 --> 00:51:44,826
I didn't think a white boy would eat chitlins!
Pig intestines.

701
00:51:51,407 --> 00:51:55,173
- What's your friend's name?
- Uh...

702
00:51:55,244 --> 00:51:57,940
- That's Big Daddy.
- Hm.

703
00:52:00,182 --> 00:52:01,615
I'm-I'm Little Daddy.

704
00:52:13,729 --> 00:52:18,632
So I was wondering... Do you guys wanna
be called colored or black?

705
00:52:20,035 --> 00:52:23,334
- Do we look like a load of laundry to you?
- Jerry, look.

706
00:52:23,405 --> 00:52:26,101
Jerry, we black. OK?

707
00:52:26,175 --> 00:52:28,905
- Black?
- Yes. We black.

708
00:52:28,978 --> 00:52:34,541
- I thought you were called the other one.
- No, man. Black is bad, man. Bad.

709
00:52:34,617 --> 00:52:36,312
That's what I mean, black is bad.

710
00:52:36,385 --> 00:52:38,250
- Can I preach to him?
- Preach on.

711
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:42,518
- No, Mayberry Jerry. "Bad" means good.
- OK, now.

712
00:52:42,591 --> 00:52:46,527
- No, no, no. "Bad" means bad. I know that.
- No, no. Listen.

713
00:52:46,595 --> 00:52:50,554
With Ellie Mae, Uncle Jed and Granny
out on the farm, "bad" might be bad.

714
00:52:50,633 --> 00:52:54,296
- Well...
- But with us, "bad" is good. You dig?

715
00:52:54,370 --> 00:52:56,634
- Say it, rev.
- Come on.

716
00:52:56,705 --> 00:53:00,835
- OK, "bad" is good.
- Talk to me, baby! You're with me now.

717
00:53:00,910 --> 00:53:02,537
OK.

718
00:53:02,611 --> 00:53:05,808
- So then what does "good" mean?

719
00:53:38,347 --> 00:53:42,750
People put me down
'cause that's the side of town I was born in

720
00:53:42,818 --> 00:53:45,446
- Is that Billy Joe Royal?
- Yeah.

721
00:53:45,521 --> 00:53:49,013
His white ass wouldn't know the poor side
of town if I dropped him off in it.

722
00:53:49,091 --> 00:53:50,217
Ah!

723
00:53:50,292 --> 00:53:53,056
- What you got?
- Wait, wait. Check this out.

724
00:53:53,128 --> 00:53:54,186
Y'all know this song?

725
00:53:55,598 --> 00:53:58,931
Aw, man! Turn that down!

726
00:53:59,001 --> 00:54:00,468
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

727
00:54:01,904 --> 00:54:05,135
Now we're gettin' our groove on, baby.

728
00:54:05,975 --> 00:54:07,033
Hey, hey.

729
00:54:07,109 --> 00:54:09,236
You cats need to get with this.

730
00:54:18,087 --> 00:54:20,851
- New Orleans!
- New Orleans!

731
00:54:24,627 --> 00:54:26,390
Whoo!

732
00:54:45,881 --> 00:54:49,510
For 12 years,
I've been a good friend to this school.

733
00:54:49,585 --> 00:54:54,488
I support basketball, football,
put up the money for the stadium.

734
00:54:54,556 --> 00:54:58,151
Always had Texas Western in my heart.

735
00:54:58,227 --> 00:55:00,695
We could never have done any of it
without you.

736
00:55:00,763 --> 00:55:05,097
But I got a little problem with Haskins
and all the colored boys he's playing.

737
00:55:05,167 --> 00:55:08,261
Now, he doesn't need 'em to win, does he?

738
00:55:08,337 --> 00:55:10,532
Well, we're undefeated.

739
00:55:14,743 --> 00:55:16,734
Whoo, man.

740
00:55:16,812 --> 00:55:19,144
- It's blazin' out there.
- I'm starving.

741
00:55:25,854 --> 00:55:29,551
Hey, man. I gotta hit the john.
Order me some huevos rancheros.

742
00:55:29,625 --> 00:55:33,288
Man, will you save that for El Paso?
I'm ordering us some pancakes.

743
00:55:33,362 --> 00:55:36,092
Whatever you get, get me something
with salsa on it, OK?

744
00:55:36,165 --> 00:55:38,998
- I already know what I'm gonna order.
- Hey, y'all, pass the menus.

745
00:55:40,369 --> 00:55:45,329
Hey. Great game last night.
Never seen anybody play like that.

746
00:55:46,108 --> 00:55:47,302
Oh, good morning.

747
00:55:47,376 --> 00:55:51,005
I need eggs. I need some sausage.
Sausage.

748
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:52,377
Unh!

749
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:56,443
- It must be a New York thing.
- That's cool.

750
00:55:56,518 --> 00:55:58,042
Unh!

751
00:55:58,120 --> 00:55:59,951
Are you guys ordering pancakes?

752
00:56:00,022 --> 00:56:02,957
Don't get your black stink on me, boy.

753
00:56:08,964 --> 00:56:12,058
- Hold on!
- Give it a good scrub, huh?

754
00:56:12,134 --> 00:56:15,467
Have a merry Christmas, though.
And have a good day. All right?

755
00:56:22,644 --> 00:56:26,273
Hey, man, you see them eggs up there?
Man, them a little plastic.

756
00:56:26,348 --> 00:56:29,647
- I don't know, man.
- Man, you can't see it.

757
00:56:39,228 --> 00:56:41,128
Shed!

758
00:56:41,196 --> 00:56:44,359
Shed, what happened?
Something's wrong.

759
00:56:44,433 --> 00:56:47,561
What happened, son?
Shed, what happened?

760
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:52,238
- Help me out here.
- What's going on? You all right?

761
00:56:52,307 --> 00:56:53,774
- Help him.
- Who did this?

762
00:57:05,187 --> 00:57:07,121
Anybody see 'em?

763
00:57:07,189 --> 00:57:11,489
Son, get on this bus. Let's go.
Look at me. Look at me. Get on the bus.

764
00:57:12,261 --> 00:57:13,592
- Baudoin.
- Who did this?

765
00:57:13,662 --> 00:57:16,995
- We ain't going nowhere!
- Get on the bus! Everyone get on there!

766
00:57:17,065 --> 00:57:19,465
- That everyone?
- Move.

767
00:57:22,671 --> 00:57:26,937
- I could kill a honky tonight.
- Ain't nobody killing nobody.

768
00:57:27,009 --> 00:57:28,704
I'm gonna start carrying a knife.

769
00:57:28,777 --> 00:57:31,143
You show a blade,
they gonna pull a shotgun.

770
00:57:31,213 --> 00:57:33,579
What are we supposed to do?
Just take it?

771
00:57:33,649 --> 00:57:37,176
Look, we can't all live the Dr. King rule.
What you want us to do?

772
00:57:37,252 --> 00:57:41,018
- Get slapped, turn the other cheek?
- Hell, no. I'm saying we think.

773
00:57:41,089 --> 00:57:44,252
When we go to the South,
we gotta go in twos.

774
00:57:44,326 --> 00:57:50,231
We're always on the lookout for each other.
Don't turn your back on them crackers.

775
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:56,303
Shed, you ain't gotta be embarrassed.
Could have happened to any one of us.

776
00:57:56,371 --> 00:58:01,308
I tell you right now, they won't catch us
alone no more. I promise you that.

777
00:58:01,376 --> 00:58:04,607
They come after one of us,
they gonna have to fight all of us.

778
00:58:19,528 --> 00:58:21,120
Mary?

779
00:58:21,196 --> 00:58:26,190
You're really late, Don.
Don't come home late without calling.

780
00:58:26,268 --> 00:58:28,862
You know, things happen to people...

781
00:58:28,937 --> 00:58:32,168
- Lemme get your plate and I'll heat it up.
- Honey, what is it?

782
00:58:32,241 --> 00:58:36,200
- Lemme get it. It'll only take a minute.
- Mary, just talk to me. What is it?

783
00:58:36,278 --> 00:58:38,769
Hey, what is this?

784
00:58:38,847 --> 00:58:41,042
Honey, what is this?

785
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:55,288
- This the first?
- No, I...

786
00:58:55,364 --> 00:58:57,958
I throw them away
as soon as I get them.

787
00:58:58,033 --> 00:59:02,493
- Why didn't you say something to me?
- I don't know. I just...

788
00:59:06,008 --> 00:59:12,072
My family's most important. How can I
protect you if I don't know what's going on?

789
00:59:12,981 --> 00:59:14,505
Don.

790
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:18,713
Basketball's been our whole life.
But it's just a game.

791
00:59:20,522 --> 00:59:23,082
I don't know if it's worth this.

792
00:59:28,697 --> 00:59:30,995
No, neither do I.

793
00:59:33,435 --> 00:59:38,566
This is more than just a game now.
And I sure as hell can't quit on it.

794
01:00:10,872 --> 01:00:14,000
Nothing ever
bothered me before.

795
01:00:14,076 --> 01:00:17,807
It's like things,
they rolled right off my back.

796
01:00:17,879 --> 01:00:20,245
I just didn't care.

797
01:00:22,384 --> 01:00:25,820
Now I care.
That scares the heck outta me.

798
01:00:25,887 --> 01:00:29,015
I don't wanna want something
I can lose.

799
01:00:30,359 --> 01:00:32,793
Baby.

800
01:00:32,861 --> 01:00:35,887
There's nothing you can't lose.

801
01:00:35,964 --> 01:00:41,425
But no one can ever take your desire
away from you. No one.

802
01:00:41,503 --> 01:00:43,095
Ever.

803
01:00:44,973 --> 01:00:49,706
You know, Scoops, man, sometimes I don't
even feel like going back out there again.

804
01:00:49,778 --> 01:00:53,578
Look. You can't let them take basketball
away from you, man.

805
01:00:53,649 --> 01:00:55,776
You can't let them win.

806
01:00:55,851 --> 01:01:00,584
I just don't know how much more of this
I can handle, man. I ain't like you, all brave.

807
01:01:00,613 --> 01:01:04,947
Sweet Pea, as long as I known you,
you been stronger than you think.

808
01:01:10,556 --> 01:01:12,820
Hey, you OK, Scoops?

809
01:01:12,891 --> 01:01:14,688
Yeah, I'm fine, man.

810
01:01:16,762 --> 01:01:20,163
Hey, man. Hey, tell me
what's goin' on, man. You OK?

811
01:01:20,232 --> 01:01:23,429
- Be ready, please. Thank you.

812
01:01:35,781 --> 01:01:37,772
Scoops, you got a minute?

813
01:01:37,850 --> 01:01:42,753
Says you got something called
hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

814
01:01:42,821 --> 01:01:45,221
My heart's too big.

815
01:01:45,290 --> 01:01:47,417
Ain't that something?

816
01:01:48,761 --> 01:01:51,628
How long you known, Scoops?

817
01:01:51,697 --> 01:01:54,564
Well, I...

818
01:01:54,633 --> 01:01:58,626
I started fainting
when I was in high school, Coach.

819
01:01:58,704 --> 01:02:01,195
So my mom being who she is,
she took me to the doctor.

820
01:02:01,273 --> 01:02:04,208
They ran a few tests. That's how
I found out. But it doesn't matter.

821
01:02:04,276 --> 01:02:07,643
You're a fool. You're a dang fool.
You could have died out there.

822
01:02:07,713 --> 01:02:10,113
Coach, I'll die if I don't play.

823
01:02:11,316 --> 01:02:15,685
Look, Coach. My whole life
I only loved playing basketball.

824
01:02:15,754 --> 01:02:19,087
That's it. But you see,
I could never play in high school,

825
01:02:19,158 --> 01:02:23,185
because I had to work
to support my mom and my sisters.

826
01:02:25,364 --> 01:02:31,166
But I never stopped playing in the street.
Never. 'Cause to not play, Coach, man...

827
01:02:31,236 --> 01:02:35,730
Man. That was like letting something
just crawl up and die in me.

828
01:02:35,808 --> 01:02:38,368
Far as this heart thing goes,
I can still play.

829
01:02:38,444 --> 01:02:42,676
My heart's good. This heart thing
ain't nothing. I lived with it this long.

830
01:02:42,748 --> 01:02:45,080
- That's why you gotta play me.
- I can't do it.

831
01:02:45,150 --> 01:02:46,879
- The doctor said I could.
- I can't.

832
01:02:46,952 --> 01:02:50,353
He said I could play a few minutes here
and there. Why you won't let me?

833
01:02:50,422 --> 01:02:53,016
I know what the doctor said, Willie.

834
01:02:53,092 --> 01:02:57,893
But I can't take a chance with your life.
I can't do that.

835
01:02:57,963 --> 01:03:00,523
Now, you're still on the team.

836
01:03:01,133 --> 01:03:03,328
We're gonna need you, Cager.

837
01:03:03,402 --> 01:03:05,836
We're gonna need your courage.

838
01:03:09,475 --> 01:03:12,603
We're gonna need that big heart of yours,
all right?

839
01:04:00,726 --> 01:04:05,459
- You got basketball on your mind, Hill?
- Yeah, Coach. Nothing but.

840
01:04:08,333 --> 01:04:11,894
Coach Haskins. Matt Pavelar,
Dallas Morning News.

841
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:13,665
You're playing a lot of coloreds.

842
01:04:13,739 --> 01:04:17,800
Are you concerned as to whether
the Negro player can handle the pressure

843
01:04:17,876 --> 01:04:20,777
at the national level?

844
01:04:20,846 --> 01:04:23,280
My team plays defense, rebounds.

845
01:04:23,348 --> 01:04:27,580
- What statement are you making?
- I'm a coach. I don't make statements.

846
01:04:27,653 --> 01:04:31,089
- Kentucky's here.
- Thank you, Coach.

847
01:04:31,857 --> 01:04:33,518
Coach Rupp. Coach Rupp.

848
01:04:33,592 --> 01:04:35,583
Coach Rupp. Coach Rupp!

849
01:04:37,229 --> 01:04:41,859
Coach Rupp, great game. Take us to the
last 20 seconds. What'd you tell the boys?

850
01:04:41,934 --> 01:04:44,425
I knew it was 20 seconds.
I gave them a good play.

851
01:04:44,503 --> 01:04:49,702
Something in our playbook we used for
years. The boys performed it to perfection.

852
01:04:49,775 --> 01:04:51,538
I'm gonna introduce myself.

853
01:04:51,610 --> 01:04:53,976
...and I know you're gonna let me go.

854
01:04:54,046 --> 01:04:55,809
- Figures.
- Thank you, Coach.

855
01:04:56,415 --> 01:04:58,713
- Coach.
- No more interviews. Thank you.

856
01:04:58,784 --> 01:05:02,447
Don Haskins.
I'm the coach over at Texas Western.

857
01:05:04,089 --> 01:05:06,148
Just wanted to introduce myself.

858
01:05:06,225 --> 01:05:09,661
Congratulate you
on another great year and...

859
01:05:09,728 --> 01:05:12,322
- These your boys?
- Yes, sir.

860
01:05:12,397 --> 01:05:14,695
Yes, sir, my players.

861
01:05:16,802 --> 01:05:20,704
Well, you had a fine season.
See you down the road.

862
01:05:29,448 --> 01:05:33,544
- Losers!
- We don't want your kind!

863
01:05:33,619 --> 01:05:36,782
Ignore all this trash!
Just get out on the court.

864
01:05:36,855 --> 01:05:38,880
Don't you come in here!

865
01:05:38,957 --> 01:05:41,949
Look at all
these stupid kids!

866
01:05:43,695 --> 01:05:46,186
Let go of me, boy!

867
01:05:46,265 --> 01:05:49,200
Don't listen to 'em.
Come on, focus.

868
01:05:49,268 --> 01:05:52,533
- That's easy for you say.
- Don't listen to 'em.

869
01:05:53,472 --> 01:05:57,169
In spite of a hostile crowd.
The Miners have played well tonight

870
01:05:57,242 --> 01:05:59,107
as they look to close out East Texas.

871
01:05:59,177 --> 01:06:03,511
And there's a block. And a fast break
opportunity for the Lions.

872
01:06:03,582 --> 01:06:06,016
And Jason Stevens puts it up for two.

873
01:06:06,084 --> 01:06:10,487
Could have been in a Miners' uniform
if Coach had been able to recruit him.

874
01:06:10,555 --> 01:06:13,683
I see Coach must be clearing the bench,
huh?

875
01:06:14,393 --> 01:06:19,456
And Stevens. With the hot hand here in the
second half. Being guarded by Baudoin.

876
01:06:24,269 --> 01:06:25,964
Coach sends his best.

877
01:06:26,038 --> 01:06:31,408
This has been a hard-fought game
on both sides. Miners lead by five.

878
01:06:31,476 --> 01:06:34,343
Takes it in to Big Daddy.
Who's pushed to the floor!

879
01:06:34,413 --> 01:06:36,313
- Are you kiddin' me?
- It is getting rough.

880
01:06:36,381 --> 01:06:40,147
Let's see who the foul's on.
They call it on Lattin! I can't believe this!

881
01:06:40,218 --> 01:06:42,345
Lattin's gotta watch his temper here.

882
01:06:42,421 --> 01:06:45,788
He's already fouled
out of ten games this year.

883
01:06:45,857 --> 01:06:48,189
Technical foul.

884
01:06:48,260 --> 01:06:51,423
Just sit down. You never let your anger
get the better of you.

885
01:06:51,496 --> 01:06:52,963
- He stuck his knee out!
- I know.

886
01:06:53,031 --> 01:06:57,559
- Lattin's temper is gonna cost the Miners.
- You gotta hold yourself together.

887
01:06:57,636 --> 01:07:00,867
- He's sticking his knee out!
- You hold yourself together.

888
01:07:00,939 --> 01:07:05,433
Keep that anger inside you and I'll let you
know when you can let it go, understand?

889
01:07:07,212 --> 01:07:10,045
At the beginning of the season.
No one could have imagined

890
01:07:10,115 --> 01:07:12,310
that we would wind up
where we are now:

891
01:07:12,384 --> 01:07:14,682
Number four in the nation.

892
01:07:14,753 --> 01:07:18,416
Close on the heels of powerhouses
like Kentucky and Kansas.

893
01:07:18,490 --> 01:07:21,857
Now. With two weeks to go
before the NCAA tournament starts.

894
01:07:21,927 --> 01:07:24,020
We're not a secret anymore.

895
01:07:32,004 --> 01:07:33,995
Been this cold before.

896
01:07:42,714 --> 01:07:44,682
Man!

897
01:07:44,750 --> 01:07:46,877
Ross, Coach, hurry!

898
01:07:58,930 --> 01:08:02,525
- Oh, man.
- Moe, get us checked out.

899
01:08:04,269 --> 01:08:08,171
Listen, we're gonna get on the bus
and go to Seattle tonight, all right?

900
01:08:08,240 --> 01:08:11,334
Get your stuff, pack up
and let's get on the bus.

901
01:08:16,481 --> 01:08:18,415
Hey, man.

902
01:08:18,483 --> 01:08:20,781
You ever get scared?

903
01:08:25,590 --> 01:08:28,024
When I was a kid in Houston...

904
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:34,421
a white gang strung me on a fire escape
till I peed my pants.

905
01:08:36,401 --> 01:08:38,699
I came back down and...

906
01:08:40,238 --> 01:08:42,934
took nothing from nobody ever again.

907
01:08:44,109 --> 01:08:48,546
Took it to every honky on the block...

908
01:08:48,613 --> 01:08:52,014
till they left Big Daddy D alone.

909
01:08:55,554 --> 01:08:59,046
But this is different.

910
01:09:01,159 --> 01:09:03,059
This is worse.

911
01:09:07,499 --> 01:09:09,933
This is the whole world.

912
01:09:10,836 --> 01:09:16,240
- Everything all right, Coach?
- Oh, what'd I get these guys into, Ross?

913
01:09:19,478 --> 01:09:22,379
You did the right thing.

914
01:09:22,447 --> 01:09:26,941
You think about what these boys had
to overcome just to get here.

915
01:09:27,018 --> 01:09:33,355
You think about how they've been
degraded and humiliated,

916
01:09:33,425 --> 01:09:37,623
just 'cause they black,
by all these "civilized" folks.

917
01:09:39,364 --> 01:09:42,458
- Shame on us.

918
01:09:43,535 --> 01:09:47,995
WTSM. 1380 broadcasting live
from Seattle. Washington.

919
01:09:48,073 --> 01:09:52,908
Hi, Miners fans. Thanks for joining us
at a packed house in the Pacific Northwest.

920
01:09:52,978 --> 01:09:57,540
The question: Will the Miners. In the last
regular season game here in Seattle.

921
01:09:57,616 --> 01:10:01,347
Take the number-one spot
in the NC 2A polls?

922
01:10:01,419 --> 01:10:07,153
Adolph Rupp's fabled Wildcats dropped
a nail-biter to Tennessee last night.

923
01:10:07,225 --> 01:10:10,661
And that will allow the Miners.
If they win here tonight.

924
01:10:10,729 --> 01:10:13,562
To take the number-one spot
in the nation.

925
01:10:14,966 --> 01:10:19,630
Hey, Lattin, you didn't jump high enough
to get toilet paper under your shoe.

926
01:10:21,039 --> 01:10:23,269
The Chieftains go down
for an easy lay-up.

927
01:10:23,341 --> 01:10:27,277
Miners making it a little too easy
for the Chieftains at this point.

928
01:10:27,345 --> 01:10:29,245
Armstrong down low.

929
01:10:29,314 --> 01:10:34,877
Armstrong's wide open. Flournoy looks
down there. Will not pass the ball.

930
01:10:34,953 --> 01:10:37,888
He wants to go it alone.
Launches a 20-footer. It's off the mark.

931
01:10:37,956 --> 01:10:40,049
Come on, man, I was wide open.

932
01:10:47,199 --> 01:10:48,689
Hill, we're in orange tonight.

933
01:10:48,767 --> 01:10:52,168
- Come on, Shed, meet the pass.
- Don't worry about me.

934
01:10:58,910 --> 01:11:00,707
The Miners are just playing flat.

935
01:11:00,779 --> 01:11:02,906
Your guy just got by you, Hill.

936
01:11:02,981 --> 01:11:06,883
There's no chemistry. No energy.
It's every man for themselves out there.

937
01:11:06,952 --> 01:11:10,888
They're not playing like a team.
That jump was no good.

938
01:11:15,794 --> 01:11:19,924
- Coach, you're in my chair.
- I like the view better down here.

939
01:11:21,633 --> 01:11:23,897
Eight minutes to play.
And I hate to say this.

940
01:11:23,969 --> 01:11:26,995
But it looks like
our Miners have given up.

941
01:11:39,417 --> 01:11:41,408
They've got only themselves
to blame.

942
01:11:41,486 --> 01:11:43,920
They didn't play together
or find the open man.

943
01:11:43,989 --> 01:11:48,119
And the Miners' perfect season
is slipping away.

944
01:12:08,947 --> 01:12:10,244
Ohh!

945
01:12:22,627 --> 01:12:25,061
You stunk out there tonight!

946
01:12:25,130 --> 01:12:28,588
Squeaky could have played better D
than you did.

947
01:12:28,667 --> 01:12:31,431
And, Shed, are you kiddin' me?

948
01:12:31,503 --> 01:12:35,599
That was the same ol' weak,
scared Shed out there.

949
01:12:35,674 --> 01:12:40,839
Maybe you thought what used to be
an undefeated record meant something.

950
01:12:40,912 --> 01:12:43,540
That we could just waltz
our way in the tournament.

951
01:12:43,615 --> 01:12:47,711
- Maybe these crackers is getting to us.
- Why you looking at me, Bobby Joe?

952
01:12:47,786 --> 01:12:50,584
You a cracker, ain't you?

953
01:12:50,655 --> 01:12:53,954
Coach, the more we win,
the harder it is for us out there.

954
01:12:54,025 --> 01:12:57,517
What do you suggest we do, Shed?
Lose?

955
01:12:57,595 --> 01:12:59,426
Give them what they want?

956
01:12:59,497 --> 01:13:03,490
You think basketball is everything, Coach.
And that's easy for you to say.

957
01:13:03,568 --> 01:13:06,366
But you don't have rednecks
in your face all the time.

958
01:13:06,438 --> 01:13:11,603
None of you white boys get it because you
don't have people breaking into your room

959
01:13:11,676 --> 01:13:13,303
or shoving your head in toilets.

960
01:13:13,378 --> 01:13:14,777
It's not us.

961
01:13:14,846 --> 01:13:17,747
White is white, Green Acres,
and that means you too.

962
01:13:17,816 --> 01:13:22,082
Yeah, I'm white. And you've never been
able to see past that! We're not like them!

963
01:13:22,153 --> 01:13:25,145
Think we haven't had heat
come down on us?

964
01:13:25,223 --> 01:13:28,954
You're the ones out there skating by,
while we're out there sweating blood.

965
01:13:29,027 --> 01:13:34,329
You think it's easy being on this team?
Taking a backseat to you every day?

966
01:13:34,399 --> 01:13:38,165
We came here to play basketball,
just like you guys!

967
01:13:38,236 --> 01:13:41,535
Now it's like we don't even count.
We're the minority!

968
01:13:41,606 --> 01:13:45,975
I don't wanna hear that from you. I have
been the minority every day of my life.

969
01:13:46,044 --> 01:13:51,414
And you're crying because you spent
the last few months in our shadows?

970
01:13:55,920 --> 01:13:58,480
Welcome to the back of the bus,
white boy.

971
01:13:58,556 --> 01:14:03,220
I wish y'all would just sit back here
and listen to yourselves.

972
01:14:03,895 --> 01:14:10,767
It's worse than losing the game.
You've all forgotten what you're doing here.

973
01:14:13,271 --> 01:14:17,207
What do you wanna do?
You wanna quit?

974
01:14:17,275 --> 01:14:22,076
- They're trying to take our dignity from us.
- Your dignity's inside you.

975
01:14:22,147 --> 01:14:26,083
Nobody can take something away from you
you don't give them.

976
01:14:27,218 --> 01:14:28,446
Hey.

977
01:14:30,522 --> 01:14:32,615
Hold your heads up.

978
01:14:34,192 --> 01:14:36,558
Hold your heads up.

979
01:14:37,162 --> 01:14:39,687
You wanna shake off that hate?

980
01:14:42,567 --> 01:14:47,561
It's your choice, Harry Flournoy.
It's your choice, Jerry Armstrong.

981
01:14:47,639 --> 01:14:49,334
Togo.

982
01:14:49,407 --> 01:14:52,274
Cager, Hill, it's your choice.

983
01:14:52,343 --> 01:14:54,971
Shut them up.

984
01:14:55,046 --> 01:14:56,445
Win.

985
01:14:57,382 --> 01:14:59,976
The NCAA Tournament gets off
to a rip-roaring start

986
01:15:00,051 --> 01:15:04,317
as the powerhouse Kansas Jayhawks
take on the upstart Texas Western Miners.

987
01:15:04,389 --> 01:15:07,415
Thank you
for keeping us together.

988
01:15:07,492 --> 01:15:11,929
Lord, we ask that you see us through,
no matter what the obstacles.

989
01:15:11,996 --> 01:15:14,794
No matter how high the mountains.

990
01:15:15,767 --> 01:15:18,634
- Amen.
- Amen.

991
01:15:18,703 --> 01:15:20,967
Let's go, guys.
Let's get this game.

992
01:15:20,971 --> 01:15:25,601
While the Texas Western club has turned
heads across the country with this roster,

993
01:15:25,676 --> 01:15:28,736
it's safe to say that Haskins' experiment
should end tonight.

994
01:15:38,822 --> 01:15:41,655
- Coach?
- You must be Mrs. Cager.

995
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:47,920
- Thanks for seeing me before the game.
- I know you come a long way, so...

996
01:15:47,998 --> 01:15:51,525
You have too.
You know, you're all he talks about.

997
01:15:52,169 --> 01:15:57,698
"Coach said this" and "Coach said that."
So I said, "Let me meet this man."

998
01:15:57,775 --> 01:16:01,267
Well, Mrs. Cager, your son's
all a coach could ever ask for.

999
01:16:01,345 --> 01:16:04,712
He's hard working, he's unselfish.

1000
01:16:04,782 --> 01:16:09,947
Tell you the truth, I wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for Willie.

1001
01:16:10,621 --> 01:16:14,148
Mr. Haskins, I came to ask you
to let him play.

1002
01:16:18,162 --> 01:16:21,791
Mrs. Cager, the thing is,
his condition is just...

1003
01:16:21,865 --> 01:16:25,130
I know about it better than anyone.

1004
01:16:26,470 --> 01:16:29,530
This is his time.

1005
01:16:29,606 --> 01:16:32,905
These are the last games
he'll ever play.

1006
01:16:34,078 --> 01:16:37,946
I don't care if it's just five minutes
or five seconds.

1007
01:16:38,015 --> 01:16:41,917
Just... let him play.

1008
01:16:46,957 --> 01:16:50,654
Led by all-American JoJo White.
The number-six Jayhawks are. With Duke.

1009
01:16:50,728 --> 01:16:55,165
The favorites to challenge Rupp and
Kentucky for basketball's holy grail.

1010
01:16:55,232 --> 01:16:57,257
That's the all-American.

1011
01:16:57,334 --> 01:16:59,598
All press clippings.

1012
01:16:59,670 --> 01:17:02,764
- Think so?
- He's all talk too.

1013
01:17:17,087 --> 01:17:22,548
Bobby Joe Hill will set up
the Texas Miner offense in the front court.

1014
01:17:23,227 --> 01:17:25,058
Stolen! JoJo White.

1015
01:17:25,129 --> 01:17:27,597
Tremendous
anticipation defensively by White.

1016
01:17:27,664 --> 01:17:30,633
Easy pass and a dunk,
and a four-nothing Jayhawk lead.

1017
01:17:30,701 --> 01:17:33,670
You gotta protect the ball, Hill!

1018
01:17:33,737 --> 01:17:35,728
Ball in to Wesley.

1019
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:38,374
He just overpowers Lattin.

1020
01:17:38,442 --> 01:17:41,741
Wesley trying to
intimidate Lattin early on in the game.

1021
01:17:41,812 --> 01:17:44,007
Defense! Defense!

1022
01:17:46,183 --> 01:17:48,981
White extends
the Jayhawk lead to five.

1023
01:17:49,053 --> 01:17:52,750
But more importantly
now Kansas has all the momentum.

1024
01:17:52,823 --> 01:17:55,986
It looks like Haskins
is going to go to his bench.

1025
01:17:56,060 --> 01:17:57,925
He's calling for Willie Cager.

1026
01:17:57,995 --> 01:18:01,123
Cager missed
half the season with heart problems.

1027
01:18:01,198 --> 01:18:04,599
But the Miners sure could use
a lift right now.

1028
01:18:07,404 --> 01:18:10,271
Now Cager
from the top of the key.

1029
01:18:10,340 --> 01:18:11,830
It's good!

1030
01:18:12,810 --> 01:18:17,440
Hey, welcome home, son! That's a good
play, Cager! Way to be out there!

1031
01:18:17,514 --> 01:18:19,505
- That's my son.
- Plays good.

1032
01:18:21,185 --> 01:18:24,621
JoJo White
into the front court. 22-footer.

1033
01:18:24,688 --> 01:18:26,178
It's good!

1034
01:18:26,256 --> 01:18:28,884
Bobby Joe Hill looking to answer
for the Miners.

1035
01:18:28,959 --> 01:18:30,017
And he'll score!

1036
01:18:30,094 --> 01:18:34,190
And these two point
guards are really putting on a show.

1037
01:18:34,264 --> 01:18:37,995
It's JoJo's turn.
From the wing. He looks unstoppable!

1038
01:18:38,068 --> 01:18:39,763
And Coach Haskins calls time.

1039
01:18:39,837 --> 01:18:43,796
Y'all are paying so much attention
to their jerseys that you're playing tight.

1040
01:18:43,874 --> 01:18:48,538
JoJo's having a big night, so I'm making a
change. Armstrong, you're in for Worsley.

1041
01:18:48,612 --> 01:18:52,275
Now, if you can stop him, bottom line is
we're gonna win this game.

1042
01:18:52,349 --> 01:18:55,716
- Don't worry. I'll take care of him.
- Let's go to work.

1043
01:18:55,786 --> 01:18:57,777
On three.

1044
01:18:57,855 --> 01:18:59,584
- Let's go, team.
- One, two, three!

1045
01:18:59,656 --> 01:19:01,180
Miners!

1046
01:19:11,201 --> 01:19:12,532
That's good D, son.

1047
01:19:13,637 --> 01:19:18,131
Lattin. Back door to Shed.
And he'll lay it in for two.

1048
01:19:28,819 --> 01:19:32,516
Here in the second half.
Armstrong has shut down JoJo White.

1049
01:19:32,589 --> 01:19:35,490
We need a stop!
We need a stop!

1050
01:19:38,362 --> 01:19:41,229
Kansas scores.
And they lead by two!

1051
01:19:41,298 --> 01:19:43,596
- Seven seconds! Push the ball!
- Seven seconds!

1052
01:19:43,667 --> 01:19:46,158
No time-outs for the Miners!

1053
01:19:51,008 --> 01:19:53,636
Long inbound to Lattin.

1054
01:19:53,710 --> 01:19:57,544
Back out to Hill. To the basket!

1055
01:19:57,614 --> 01:19:59,514
Cager! He got it!

1056
01:20:00,918 --> 01:20:02,613
What a play!

1057
01:20:02,686 --> 01:20:07,055
He wasn't expected to play tonight.
But he saved the season for the Miners!

1058
01:20:07,124 --> 01:20:11,686
Overtime! Hey, you got an overtime!
Hey, get in here! We got an overtime!

1059
01:20:11,762 --> 01:20:15,630
And we'll play overtime
to settle this one!

1060
01:20:20,637 --> 01:20:22,798
That's the way to go! That's it!

1061
01:20:26,076 --> 01:20:29,534
Just seconds remaining.

1062
01:20:29,613 --> 01:20:31,604
Artis. Up to Lattin.

1063
01:20:31,682 --> 01:20:35,584
It's good! And the Miners win!
The Miners win!

1064
01:20:35,652 --> 01:20:40,180
They're calling it
hanging on the rim! I can't believe it!

1065
01:20:40,257 --> 01:20:43,226
A foul called
against David Lattin.

1066
01:20:43,293 --> 01:20:46,524
The basket will count
and Kansas will shoot two free throws

1067
01:20:46,597 --> 01:20:49,589
to try to send the game
to a second overtime.

1068
01:21:06,516 --> 01:21:10,282
JoJo makes both.
And we're going to a second overtime.

1069
01:21:10,354 --> 01:21:11,946
All right, bring it in!

1070
01:21:12,022 --> 01:21:14,616
Oh. Is this a game for the record books!

1071
01:21:14,691 --> 01:21:16,625
We got a great mismatch, a little low.

1072
01:21:16,693 --> 01:21:20,288
So we're gonna swing in the ball
and let him take his man one on one.

1073
01:21:20,364 --> 01:21:22,195
You got it? All right, let's do it.

1074
01:21:25,369 --> 01:21:30,363
OK, here we go. The winner moves on
for the national championship.

1075
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:33,034
Lattin. Cross-court pass to Artis.

1076
01:21:33,110 --> 01:21:35,670
He'll drive the baseline and score!

1077
01:21:35,746 --> 01:21:39,341
The Jayhawk defender really bit
on that fake. And the Miners lead by one.

1078
01:21:39,416 --> 01:21:41,884
Kansas needs a basket to win.
Where they going?

1079
01:21:41,952 --> 01:21:44,819
Everyone knows
who will take this shot -

1080
01:21:44,888 --> 01:21:47,550
it's their all-American JoJo White.

1081
01:21:50,694 --> 01:21:53,492
Ball goes in to JoJo!

1082
01:21:53,563 --> 01:21:55,326
From the sideline!

1083
01:21:57,301 --> 01:22:01,067
It's good! Kansas wins! Kansas wins!

1084
01:22:04,908 --> 01:22:08,935
Wait a minute. Ralph!
It looks like he stepped on the line.

1085
01:22:09,012 --> 01:22:11,810
I think the official's going
to wave the basket off.

1086
01:22:11,882 --> 01:22:17,047
It's no good! And Texas
Western's improbable story continues

1087
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:21,580
with an 81-80 double overtime win
over the Kansas Jayhawks.

1088
01:22:29,066 --> 01:22:31,694
Have you seen this?
Have you read this already?

1089
01:22:31,768 --> 01:22:32,962
I read it.

1090
01:22:33,036 --> 01:22:37,302
It says, "The selfless support of Texas
Western's booster Wade Richardsons,

1091
01:22:37,374 --> 01:22:41,902
which has made this breakout team's rise
a true phenomenon in the sports world."

1092
01:22:41,978 --> 01:22:45,379
Well, they got you down,
didn't they, sir?

1093
01:22:45,449 --> 01:22:47,849
Just forget all that stuff I said before.

1094
01:22:47,918 --> 01:22:52,514
I've been selling more dinettes than
I've sold in the last four years combined.

1095
01:22:55,559 --> 01:22:59,893
You're 24 hours from the biggest game
in college basketball. How do you feel?

1096
01:22:59,963 --> 01:23:01,726
You know, I've been here before.

1097
01:23:01,798 --> 01:23:04,596
It's been some time now,
but I've had some success here

1098
01:23:04,668 --> 01:23:07,762
and I feel like I'm coming home, really.

1099
01:23:07,838 --> 01:23:10,068
I'm just glad to be here.

1100
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:13,132
I'd like to ask you
about your controversial win over Kansas.

1101
01:23:13,210 --> 01:23:18,807
There's no controversy. JoJo White
stepped out of bounds. They lost, we won.

1102
01:23:27,524 --> 01:23:31,824
Coach Haskins, how do you plan on
stopping Louie Dampier and Pat Riley?

1103
01:23:31,895 --> 01:23:35,854
Ask Coach Rupp how he plans on
stopping David Lattin and Bobby Joe Hill.

1104
01:23:35,932 --> 01:23:36,899
Who?

1105
01:23:38,635 --> 01:23:40,262
You have to admit. Coach Rupp.

1106
01:23:40,337 --> 01:23:44,398
That the Negro player is changing
the game of basketball.

1107
01:23:44,474 --> 01:23:45,463
Oh?

1108
01:23:45,542 --> 01:23:52,243
Well, as far as I know, basketball's about
taking the basketball, putting it in the hoop.

1109
01:23:52,816 --> 01:23:57,344
And you can quote me.
I don't think that's going to change.

1110
01:23:57,421 --> 01:24:00,185
That horrible man,
playing those coloreds.

1111
01:24:00,257 --> 01:24:02,817
And where are you from, sweetheart?

1112
01:24:02,893 --> 01:24:07,557
El Paso, Texas. I'm married to that
horrible man you were just talking about.

1113
01:24:07,631 --> 01:24:11,931
Coach Rupp, what do you think of their
lightning-quick guard, Bobby Joe Hill?

1114
01:24:12,002 --> 01:24:15,597
He's a good boy. But there's lots
of good boys out there this year.

1115
01:24:15,672 --> 01:24:18,732
Well. This good little boy led us
to 23 and one.

1116
01:24:20,310 --> 01:24:22,642
Well, I think you understood my point.

1117
01:24:22,712 --> 01:24:28,116
My point is that we at Kentucky don't worry
about the boys in other uniforms.

1118
01:24:28,185 --> 01:24:29,675
We play our game.

1119
01:24:32,656 --> 01:24:38,151
Don't pay them any mind.
It's just how some people were raised.

1120
01:24:38,228 --> 01:24:41,026
Well, they weren't raised right.

1121
01:24:41,097 --> 01:24:43,292
I guess not.

1122
01:24:44,901 --> 01:24:48,234
But not everybody thinks like that.

1123
01:24:49,573 --> 01:24:52,508
My name is Esther.

1124
01:24:52,576 --> 01:24:54,669
Esther Rupp.

1125
01:24:55,378 --> 01:25:00,008
Nice to meet you. Mary Haskins.

1126
01:25:00,650 --> 01:25:03,949
Let's get this game over with
so we can get back to Memphis.

1127
01:25:04,020 --> 01:25:08,719
Well, one thing's for sure -
can't no five niggers beat five white boys.

1128
01:25:09,693 --> 01:25:13,993
Yeah. Just black trash, that's all they are.
They think they belong here.

1129
01:25:14,064 --> 01:25:15,497
Harris. That's enough.

1130
01:25:15,565 --> 01:25:19,228
- Wait, I'm just getting started here. Hold it.

1131
01:25:19,736 --> 01:25:23,832
Maybe old Coach Rupp still
has a thing to learn about basketball.

1132
01:25:23,907 --> 01:25:28,037
These boys are playing
for more than just the championship.

1133
01:25:30,580 --> 01:25:32,810
When I came here...

1134
01:25:35,585 --> 01:25:37,849
I didn't wanna come.

1135
01:25:39,890 --> 01:25:42,723
I didn't wanna be a part of this.

1136
01:25:44,227 --> 01:25:46,752
But I was wrong, Don.

1137
01:25:47,797 --> 01:25:49,958
I was wrong.

1138
01:26:42,152 --> 01:26:44,882
You know, my dad called.

1139
01:26:44,955 --> 01:26:50,723
He said everybody in town's going to
Thelma's Steakhouse to watch the game.

1140
01:26:54,264 --> 01:26:56,755
He said he was proud of me.

1141
01:26:56,833 --> 01:27:02,271
It was always just a game to me. But now
it feels like a lot more than a game.

1142
01:27:02,339 --> 01:27:07,367
Yeah, I know what you mean, brother.
Feels like my whole life.

1143
01:27:07,444 --> 01:27:11,403
My folks are driving down
with Willie's parents.

1144
01:27:11,481 --> 01:27:14,814
My old man's coming too.

1145
01:27:14,884 --> 01:27:21,687
He was always a baseball fan.
But I think he's finally liking basketball.

1146
01:27:21,758 --> 01:27:24,158
Bobby Joe. You hear me, man?

1147
01:27:25,095 --> 01:27:29,156
This ain't gonna be nothing.
It's just a day at the playground.

1148
01:27:36,506 --> 01:27:37,632
Hello?

1149
01:27:45,482 --> 01:27:47,848
Take a look out there.

1150
01:27:48,852 --> 01:27:51,412
We can't win tomorrow night.

1151
01:27:53,523 --> 01:27:56,390
You're not a championship team.

1152
01:27:57,327 --> 01:28:02,060
You've been lucky so far,
but tomorrow your luck's gonna run out.

1153
01:28:05,001 --> 01:28:08,164
To win at this level, you gotta have a...

1154
01:28:10,707 --> 01:28:14,438
intelligence inside you out on that court.

1155
01:28:15,245 --> 01:28:17,645
You gotta be able to think.

1156
01:28:17,714 --> 01:28:21,115
We just got too much
of the wrong complexion.

1157
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:27,055
You're athletes, sure.

1158
01:28:27,123 --> 01:28:30,149
But so are monkeys.

1159
01:28:32,996 --> 01:28:34,054
Mm-hm.

1160
01:28:34,130 --> 01:28:36,963
You can run. You can jump.

1161
01:28:37,033 --> 01:28:40,696
Maybe even hit the occasional outside shot
with the right training,

1162
01:28:40,770 --> 01:28:43,568
but to compete against a real team...

1163
01:28:47,177 --> 01:28:54,083
Well, should I go on, or you as sick
of this same old tired line of BS as I am?

1164
01:28:58,888 --> 01:29:04,884
I'm so sick of it, tonight I made a decision
that we're gonna put a stop to it forever.

1165
01:29:08,331 --> 01:29:10,765
Lattin.

1166
01:29:10,834 --> 01:29:12,324
Flournoy.

1167
01:29:12,402 --> 01:29:14,962
Artis, Cager, Worsley, Hill.

1168
01:29:16,506 --> 01:29:17,666
Shed.

1169
01:29:20,477 --> 01:29:23,002
Five starters, two subs.

1170
01:29:23,079 --> 01:29:25,138
40 minutes, seven players.

1171
01:29:25,215 --> 01:29:30,084
I'm only gonna play the black players
in the final game tomorrow.

1172
01:29:30,153 --> 01:29:32,383
Just you.

1173
01:29:32,455 --> 01:29:34,821
Togo, Armstrong, Palacio,

1174
01:29:34,891 --> 01:29:37,359
Myers, Baudoin.

1175
01:29:38,394 --> 01:29:42,558
I know how hard every one of you worked
to get here. I don't wanna hurt any of you.

1176
01:29:42,632 --> 01:29:45,931
Coach. I can't lie.

1177
01:29:46,002 --> 01:29:48,197
I wanna play.

1178
01:29:49,105 --> 01:29:51,938
I do. We all wanna play.

1179
01:29:55,645 --> 01:29:59,604
But I just wanna say one thing.

1180
01:30:02,452 --> 01:30:04,443
Tomorrow night,

1181
01:30:04,521 --> 01:30:11,324
y'all go out there and show 'em how bad
five brothers can be on the court.

1182
01:30:13,763 --> 01:30:15,754
OK?

1183
01:30:17,967 --> 01:30:23,303
Flournoy, if you don't get back and play
defense, I'll be all over your black butt.

1184
01:30:34,984 --> 01:30:38,215
Good evening and welcome
to the Cole Field House for the finals

1185
01:30:38,288 --> 01:30:40,813
of the NCAA Championship game

1186
01:30:40,890 --> 01:30:45,987
between the University of Kentucky
and Texas Western College.

1187
01:30:46,062 --> 01:30:48,553
And here come the Miners.

1188
01:30:58,775 --> 01:31:01,573
When this tournament began.
Virtually everybody

1189
01:31:01,644 --> 01:31:03,612
could have predicted one of our finalists.

1190
01:31:03,680 --> 01:31:06,478
But I don't think anyone
could have predicted the other.

1191
01:31:06,549 --> 01:31:10,110
It's Texas Western College
against the University of Kentucky

1192
01:31:10,186 --> 01:31:12,711
for the NCAA Championship.

1193
01:31:12,789 --> 01:31:15,417
A little mining college from
out in West Texas.

1194
01:31:15,491 --> 01:31:19,552
A scrappy bunch with an unusual lineup
going against basketball royalty.

1195
01:31:19,629 --> 01:31:24,066
The Baron of the Bluegrass
and his four NCAA men's championships.

1196
01:31:24,133 --> 01:31:26,931
If there was ever more of a mismatch,
I don't remember it.

1197
01:31:27,003 --> 01:31:30,336
Here's tonight's starting lineup
for the Kentucky Wildcats.

1198
01:31:30,406 --> 01:31:33,569
At guard number 30, six-three,
Tommy Kron.

1199
01:31:33,643 --> 01:31:36,043
The Cats are led
by two great all-Americans.

1200
01:31:36,112 --> 01:31:41,106
First of all. Sharp-shooting Louie Dampier
and the high-scoring Pat Riley.

1201
01:31:41,184 --> 01:31:43,345
These guys play with speed.

1202
01:31:43,419 --> 01:31:47,321
They play with poise
and they play with intelligence.

1203
01:31:47,390 --> 01:31:51,121
And the coach of
the Kentucky Wildcats. Adolph Rupp.

1204
01:31:51,194 --> 01:31:55,597
Now here's the starting lineup
for the Texas Western Miners.

1205
01:31:55,665 --> 01:32:00,830
At guard. Out of Detroit. Michigan.
Number 14. five-ten. Bobby Joe Hill.

1206
01:32:00,904 --> 01:32:04,965
At the other guard, number 24,
five-six Willie Worsley.

1207
01:32:05,041 --> 01:32:10,035
At center. From Houston. Texas.
Number 43. six-seven. David Lattin.

1208
01:32:10,113 --> 01:32:13,844
At forward. Number 44. six-five.
Harry Flournoy.

1209
01:32:13,917 --> 01:32:17,045
At the other forward. Number 20.
Orsten Artis.

1210
01:32:17,120 --> 01:32:21,022
And the coach of the Texas Western
Miners. Don Haskins.

1211
01:32:21,090 --> 01:32:23,957
We have a
David-versus-Goliath match-up.

1212
01:32:24,027 --> 01:32:28,327
Texas Western against Kentucky
for the NCAA Championship.

1213
01:32:28,398 --> 01:32:31,697
You had a great season, Coach.
You must be thrilled to be here.

1214
01:32:34,137 --> 01:32:36,401
- One, two, three.
- Miners!

1215
01:32:37,307 --> 01:32:40,037
You three guards are in there
to stop their fast break.

1216
01:32:40,109 --> 01:32:42,202
Make them have to walk it down the court.

1217
01:32:42,278 --> 01:32:45,714
You saw who they put on the floor.
They're gonna try to run against us.

1218
01:32:45,782 --> 01:32:49,980
In an unprecedented move, Coach
Haskins is starting five Negro players.

1219
01:32:50,053 --> 01:32:53,682
- That's a spit in the face.
- A first in NCAA Championship history.

1220
01:32:53,756 --> 01:32:57,920
Now I want you to get angry. Go out there
first time you get the ball and dunk it.

1221
01:32:57,994 --> 01:33:00,963
I don't care if you have
to run someone over to do it.

1222
01:33:01,030 --> 01:33:02,793
We're faster.
We can spit right back.

1223
01:33:02,865 --> 01:33:04,526
Send 'em a message. Get in there.

1224
01:33:04,600 --> 01:33:07,330
They're the one that got a chip
on their shoulder, not us.

1225
01:33:07,403 --> 01:33:10,429
It ain't about nothing except basketball.
One, two, three!

1226
01:33:10,506 --> 01:33:11,996
Miners!

1227
01:33:12,075 --> 01:33:15,977
Dampier's a great ball handler. You try
to take it from him, he's gonna burn you.

1228
01:33:16,045 --> 01:33:18,809
- Come on, Coach.
- Some say he's the best guard.

1229
01:33:18,881 --> 01:33:21,782
If I had a choice between him and you,
I'd choose you.

1230
01:33:21,851 --> 01:33:24,843
That's good, 'cause you know
he wouldn't have chose me.

1231
01:33:31,027 --> 01:33:34,690
The opening tap.
Big David Lattin against Pat Riley.

1232
01:33:39,335 --> 01:33:42,133
And the tap is controlled
by Texas Western.

1233
01:33:42,205 --> 01:33:46,403
Worsley gives it to Bobby Joe Hill.
Now Hill rockets a pass into Lattin.

1234
01:33:46,476 --> 01:33:48,341
And he dunks it over Riley.

1235
01:33:48,411 --> 01:33:50,572
Aah!

1236
01:33:50,646 --> 01:33:51,704
Yeah!

1237
01:33:53,950 --> 01:33:58,387
- He was making a statement with that.
- And Adolph Rupp looks disgusted.

1238
01:33:58,454 --> 01:34:02,823
Now Kentucky on offense for the first time.
The ball in the hands of Louie Dampier.

1239
01:34:02,892 --> 01:34:05,588
Texas Western in a man-to-man.
He gets it to Conley.

1240
01:34:05,661 --> 01:34:09,427
He's got a mismatch on Worsley. Backs
him down and scores. We're tied at two.

1241
01:34:09,499 --> 01:34:13,367
Conley, that's gonna be there
all night long.

1242
01:34:13,436 --> 01:34:17,930
The Miners work the ball into David Lattin.
He spins outta the double team. Scores.

1243
01:34:18,007 --> 01:34:19,235
There it is. There it is.

1244
01:34:19,308 --> 01:34:23,677
It's six-seven. 240
pounds of a powerhouse in the middle.

1245
01:34:23,746 --> 01:34:26,544
Wildcats get the ball to the high post.
Thad Jaracz has it.

1246
01:34:26,616 --> 01:34:29,380
- Slow it down. Set it up.
- Lattin, get physical.

1247
01:34:29,452 --> 01:34:32,216
They cut off him.
He puts it on the floor. Goes to the hoop.

1248
01:34:32,288 --> 01:34:34,916
And he is fouled
and fouled hard by David Lattin.

1249
01:34:34,991 --> 01:34:38,256
That's a flagrant foul!
You gonna call that, ref?

1250
01:34:38,327 --> 01:34:42,627
That's a flagrant foul! You want there to be
a melee? Someone's gonna get hurt here.

1251
01:34:42,698 --> 01:34:44,256
I'll call the foul. Two shots.

1252
01:34:44,333 --> 01:34:46,358
A pair of free throws ties the game
at 12.

1253
01:34:46,436 --> 01:34:49,166
But the Baron is not happy
on the Kentucky bench.

1254
01:34:49,238 --> 01:34:52,469
Texas Western very disciplined
against this Kentucky zone.

1255
01:34:52,542 --> 01:34:55,636
They work the ball down low to Lattin.
He goes up for the shot.

1256
01:34:55,711 --> 01:35:00,171
No good. Offensive rebound.
Flournoy. And he is down and hurt.

1257
01:35:00,249 --> 01:35:01,944
Stay down.
Coach.

1258
01:35:02,018 --> 01:35:03,451
Ohh!

1259
01:35:06,722 --> 01:35:08,952
Where'd he hurt? Harry.

1260
01:35:09,025 --> 01:35:12,017
How'd you come down?
Did it go out or in? Hold still.

1261
01:35:12,095 --> 01:35:14,996
Well, that's one less thing
to worry about.

1262
01:35:18,101 --> 01:35:20,092
Cager, you're in.

1263
01:35:23,339 --> 01:35:26,365
And it looks like Flournoy has
to come out of this game.

1264
01:35:26,442 --> 01:35:29,468
This will be a huge blow
to the Miners if he can't return.

1265
01:35:29,545 --> 01:35:31,012
He's through for the night.

1266
01:35:31,080 --> 01:35:35,141
Oh. Boy. This will be tough because he's
a great rebounder for Texas Western.

1267
01:35:35,218 --> 01:35:40,815
At six-five. He is one of the best.
And it'll be a disaster if he can't continue.

1268
01:35:40,890 --> 01:35:43,222
Tough break, son.

1269
01:35:47,396 --> 01:35:50,229
Ten minutes gone
in this fast-paced first half.

1270
01:35:50,299 --> 01:35:53,996
Kentucky with the ball and the lead.
Here's a backdoor cut by Riley.

1271
01:35:54,070 --> 01:35:56,061
He goes up and is slammed to the floor.

1272
01:35:56,139 --> 01:35:58,937
And that'll be number three
on Big David Lattin.

1273
01:35:59,008 --> 01:36:03,342
That really hurts the Miners because this
big guy's been carrying Texas Western

1274
01:36:03,412 --> 01:36:05,209
with his strong inside play.

1275
01:36:05,281 --> 01:36:09,149
Now Don Haskins will have to take
the very physical Lattin out of the game.

1276
01:36:09,218 --> 01:36:10,742
I can't let you foul out.

1277
01:36:10,820 --> 01:36:15,484
And it looks like Nevil Shed is replacing
him. But they're giving up something here.

1278
01:36:15,558 --> 01:36:21,019
Riley's first free throw is good. And Coach
Haskins wants a word with Bobby Joe Hill.

1279
01:36:21,797 --> 01:36:25,494
The Wildcats by four now with a chance
to stretch their lead.

1280
01:36:25,568 --> 01:36:28,560
Here's Tommy Kron
bringing the ball up for Kentucky.

1281
01:36:28,638 --> 01:36:31,300
Orsten Artis all over him.
And here comes Hill!

1282
01:36:31,374 --> 01:36:34,901
He strips it away
and he's going in for the lay-up!

1283
01:36:34,977 --> 01:36:37,502
What a pair of hands.

1284
01:36:38,414 --> 01:36:40,405
What a steal by Hill.

1285
01:36:40,483 --> 01:36:42,075
That happens when you don't talk
to each other.

1286
01:36:42,151 --> 01:36:46,485
This time Louie Dampier with the
basketball. He's played by Bobby Joe Hill.

1287
01:36:46,556 --> 01:36:49,047
He steps in and steals it again!
Holy mackerel!

1288
01:36:49,125 --> 01:36:53,061
Bobby Joe Hill picked the lock
on the Fort Knox hands of Louie Dampier.

1289
01:36:53,129 --> 01:36:57,566
And he's got back-to-back steals and
lay-ups. And like that. We're tied again.

1290
01:36:57,633 --> 01:36:59,328
Time-out. Time-out!

1291
01:36:59,402 --> 01:37:03,133
- Kentucky wants time.
- Time-out. White.

1292
01:37:03,206 --> 01:37:04,138
Yes.

1293
01:37:08,044 --> 01:37:10,945
Hey, those are two big-time plays, Hill.

1294
01:37:11,013 --> 01:37:13,447
- Are you scared?
- No, sir!

1295
01:37:13,516 --> 01:37:16,246
I know someone who's not scared.
Conley's not.

1296
01:37:16,319 --> 01:37:18,446
We don't teach scared
at the University of Kentucky.

1297
01:37:18,521 --> 01:37:21,888
I need you standing there waiting for 'em
when they come outta time-out,

1298
01:37:21,958 --> 01:37:23,653
like a force, like a wall!

1299
01:37:23,726 --> 01:37:27,287
Don't let that guy crowd you!
Get him out of there.

1300
01:37:27,363 --> 01:37:31,060
This the national championship.
Are you surprised? They come to play.

1301
01:37:31,133 --> 01:37:35,126
So we got to play back. We know how
to play this game better than anybody.

1302
01:37:35,204 --> 01:37:36,967
Play the game. Let's go.

1303
01:37:37,039 --> 01:37:38,836
Over here!

1304
01:37:41,844 --> 01:37:43,641
Yeah!

1305
01:37:45,648 --> 01:37:47,138
Set it up, set it up.

1306
01:37:47,216 --> 01:37:50,743
Defense, defense!
Watch Hill. Inside!

1307
01:37:50,820 --> 01:37:52,185
Whoa! Whoa!

1308
01:37:56,058 --> 01:37:58,356
That's it. That's what I want.

1309
01:38:08,237 --> 01:38:09,226
Whoo!

1310
01:38:11,507 --> 01:38:13,873
Inside of ten seconds to go. First half.

1311
01:38:13,943 --> 01:38:18,039
Jaracz with the ball. High post.
Looking for Riley. Running off a screen.

1312
01:38:18,114 --> 01:38:20,344
Here's a shot at the buzzer.

1313
01:38:20,416 --> 01:38:22,111
It's good!

1314
01:38:26,589 --> 01:38:29,353
We're all a little shocked.

1315
01:38:29,425 --> 01:38:32,223
Texas Western is leading Kentucky
at the half.

1316
01:38:32,295 --> 01:38:35,093
But the smart money
has to be on Kentucky

1317
01:38:35,164 --> 01:38:38,327
'cause they were firing on all cylinders
to end the half.

1318
01:38:38,401 --> 01:38:40,164
The Miners did have some big plays.

1319
01:38:40,236 --> 01:38:43,228
But must be concerned with the three fouls
on David Lattin

1320
01:38:43,306 --> 01:38:45,433
as well as the injury to Harry Flournoy.

1321
01:38:45,508 --> 01:38:47,066
He will not return.

1322
01:38:53,215 --> 01:38:56,048
- Yo, hurry up, you late.
- Close the door. Come on.

1323
01:38:56,118 --> 01:38:58,586
They're getting ready
to start the second half.

1324
01:38:58,654 --> 01:38:59,916
... crowning a champion.

1325
01:38:59,989 --> 01:39:02,981
Don't let that cocky kid set a tent up
under the basket.

1326
01:39:03,059 --> 01:39:07,086
If he gets position on you, it'll throw down
every time. Get him out of there!

1327
01:39:07,163 --> 01:39:12,191
I'm putting you in with three fouls, Lattin.
You gotta play smart and protect the paint.

1328
01:39:12,268 --> 01:39:16,102
He's trying to figure out how to get you
to foul out, so keep your feet on the ground.

1329
01:39:16,172 --> 01:39:19,266
- Get a body on him. I want him outta there.
- OK? You ready?

1330
01:39:19,342 --> 01:39:21,708
- Are you the University of Kentucky?
- Yes, sir.

1331
01:39:21,777 --> 01:39:23,836
What has the Baron designed
for his Wildcats?

1332
01:39:23,913 --> 01:39:27,508
- Come on, number ten.
- Wildcats give the ball to Louie Dampier.

1333
01:39:27,583 --> 01:39:28,607
Get your hand up!

1334
01:39:28,684 --> 01:39:31,175
- Here's his long jump shot.
- There it is.

1335
01:39:31,253 --> 01:39:33,448
And the Kentucky fans are on their feet.

1336
01:39:33,522 --> 01:39:34,955
Come on, get back!

1337
01:39:35,024 --> 01:39:38,516
The Miners feed it inside to Lattin.
And Riley steals it away.

1338
01:39:38,594 --> 01:39:41,461
Now Kentucky looks to break.
Tommy Kron on the point.

1339
01:39:41,530 --> 01:39:44,761
Feeds it to Riley. Who beats Lattin
to the basket and lays it in for two!

1340
01:39:44,834 --> 01:39:46,927
Now. That is Kentucky basketball.

1341
01:39:47,002 --> 01:39:48,492
That's it, that's it.

1342
01:39:48,571 --> 01:39:52,632
Kentucky trapping outta their zone.
And Kron takes it away from Worsley.

1343
01:39:52,708 --> 01:39:56,371
The Wildcats look to run again.
Fast break ahead to Riley.

1344
01:39:56,445 --> 01:39:59,243
And that is back-to-back hoops
for the all-American.

1345
01:39:59,315 --> 01:40:03,376
I don't know what Coach Rupp told his
team at halftime. But they are on fire.

1346
01:40:03,452 --> 01:40:06,046
This is how the number-one team
in the nation plays.

1347
01:40:06,122 --> 01:40:09,558
Here's Riley on the move to the basket.
And Lattin fouls him again.

1348
01:40:09,625 --> 01:40:12,219
Foul. Miners, number 43!

1349
01:40:12,294 --> 01:40:15,991
And that will send the big center
to the bench with his fourth foul.

1350
01:40:16,065 --> 01:40:17,464
That's aggressive play.

1351
01:40:17,533 --> 01:40:21,162
The Miners are hanging in.
But that's gotta hurt on both ends.

1352
01:40:21,237 --> 01:40:24,001
Hey, there's a lot of ball on that, ref.

1353
01:40:28,411 --> 01:40:32,370
I know Lattin's out. But you can't do this
all by yourself. Just slow it down.

1354
01:40:32,448 --> 01:40:34,006
OK? Get everybody involved.

1355
01:40:36,318 --> 01:40:39,651
And Kentucky leads by eight
with ten minutes to play.

1356
01:40:39,722 --> 01:40:41,713
Ball! Ball, ball!

1357
01:40:42,992 --> 01:40:46,189
Bobby Joe Hill will fire one up
from 25 feet.

1358
01:40:46,262 --> 01:40:47,286
And he got it!

1359
01:40:47,363 --> 01:40:48,523
Check him! Check him!

1360
01:40:48,597 --> 01:40:49,757
Whoo!

1361
01:40:49,832 --> 01:40:52,164
Defense, now, defense!

1362
01:40:58,007 --> 01:41:00,475
Way to penetrate. That's what I want.

1363
01:41:03,012 --> 01:41:04,502
Ah, ha-ha!

1364
01:41:09,919 --> 01:41:11,011
Yes!

1365
01:41:23,766 --> 01:41:26,860
Cager's spun it off the glass.
And the Miners lead by three!

1366
01:41:26,936 --> 01:41:30,702
Time. Time! Time-out, Wildcats!

1367
01:41:31,574 --> 01:41:33,132
Coach Rupp calls time.
He's seen enough.

1368
01:41:34,310 --> 01:41:38,406
Miners lead at 64-61.
Just two minutes left.

1369
01:41:45,688 --> 01:41:50,352
All season, when you had nothing left,
you come up with it. And you had success.

1370
01:41:50,426 --> 01:41:52,291
You did it, you did it.

1371
01:41:52,361 --> 01:41:55,819
And that's how we got here, from your
efforts. From your efforts, we're here.

1372
01:41:55,898 --> 01:42:00,164
We are two minutes from a championship.
Lattin, I'm putting you back in.

1373
01:42:00,236 --> 01:42:03,069
Right now it's not about talent -
it's about heart.

1374
01:42:03,138 --> 01:42:06,539
It's about who can go out there
and play the hardest and the smartest.

1375
01:42:06,609 --> 01:42:08,668
This team's a special team.

1376
01:42:09,945 --> 01:42:12,175
Special team.

1377
01:42:13,516 --> 01:42:15,279
You're gonna win this game.

1378
01:42:15,351 --> 01:42:16,909
- You hear that?
- Yes, sir.

1379
01:42:16,986 --> 01:42:21,389
You're gonna win this game.
So go out there and make me a prophet.

1380
01:42:21,457 --> 01:42:23,948
They've been here before -
they won't give it to us.

1381
01:42:24,026 --> 01:42:28,053
We gotta go out there and we gotta take it!
Right? Take it! Take it!

1382
01:42:28,130 --> 01:42:31,031
I want you to go out there and take it!
One, two, three!

1383
01:42:31,100 --> 01:42:32,533
Take it!

1384
01:42:38,641 --> 01:42:43,044
Two minutes to go. And the Miners lead
Adolph Rupp and Kentucky by three.

1385
01:42:43,112 --> 01:42:45,046
Defense! Defense!

1386
01:42:45,114 --> 01:42:46,103
Four-two.

1387
01:42:46,181 --> 01:42:49,309
Louie Dampier guarded tightly
by Bobby Joe Hill.

1388
01:42:49,385 --> 01:42:51,979
He reverses his dribble and fires.
It's good!

1389
01:42:52,054 --> 01:42:53,043
There it is.

1390
01:42:53,122 --> 01:42:55,590
That was a big shot.

1391
01:42:55,658 --> 01:42:57,649
Miners look to answer.

1392
01:43:00,396 --> 01:43:01,954
Yes!

1393
01:43:02,031 --> 01:43:04,591
Wildcats into the front court.
Needing a score.

1394
01:43:04,667 --> 01:43:06,862
Riley breaks free.

1395
01:43:12,708 --> 01:43:14,608
Set it up! Set it up!

1396
01:43:14,677 --> 01:43:17,009
Now who will answer the bell
for the Miners?

1397
01:43:17,079 --> 01:43:19,240
Artis passes it to Cager
at the foul line.

1398
01:43:19,315 --> 01:43:23,479
He slashes around Jaracz.
Takes it right down Main Street.

1399
01:43:27,423 --> 01:43:31,052
So it comes down to this.
18 seconds remain.

1400
01:43:31,126 --> 01:43:33,424
Wildcats with the ball.
In need of a score

1401
01:43:33,495 --> 01:43:36,931
to keep their hopes
of a fifth national championship alive.

1402
01:43:36,999 --> 01:43:41,436
Kentucky looking inside for a mismatch
against the shorter Worsley.

1403
01:43:42,972 --> 01:43:44,997
Stolen away by Bobby Joe.

1404
01:44:05,961 --> 01:44:09,192
Desperation time now for Kentucky
in the final seconds.

1405
01:44:09,264 --> 01:44:12,859
Here's a miss by Kron.
Lattin has the rebound for Texas Western.

1406
01:44:12,935 --> 01:44:17,167
He gives it to Bobby Joe. Looking
at the clock. Watching it count down.

1407
01:44:17,239 --> 01:44:20,037
Ten. Nine. Eight...

1408
01:44:20,109 --> 01:44:23,545
The Miners are on their way to victory.

1409
01:44:30,853 --> 01:44:33,378
Whoo! Whoo!

1410
01:44:42,164 --> 01:44:46,100
This is the greatest upset
in NCAA history!

1411
01:44:46,168 --> 01:44:50,502
Texas Western is
the new national champion!

1412
01:45:07,189 --> 01:45:08,213
Whoo!

1413
01:45:08,290 --> 01:45:11,088
National champion!

1414
01:45:22,371 --> 01:45:25,431
Mama, I'm a national champion.

1415
01:45:26,241 --> 01:45:29,039
I'm a national champion.

1416
01:45:29,111 --> 01:45:30,703
Whoo!

1417
01:45:38,153 --> 01:45:40,815
Where is he?
I can't see! Where is he?

1418
01:45:45,327 --> 01:45:47,591
I love you, Mama. Thank you.

1419
01:50:39,888 --> 01:50:45,690
You know, Kentucky's so big,
and Adolph Rupp's name was so big,

1420
01:50:45,761 --> 01:50:50,721
that, I guess,
that made it more significant.

1421
01:50:50,799 --> 01:50:54,394
The initial thought was,
"Do we really have a chance here?"

1422
01:50:54,469 --> 01:50:57,233
We felt their presence
at the beginning of the game,

1423
01:50:57,305 --> 01:51:00,866
when they came out
with this incredible effort and zeal.

1424
01:51:00,942 --> 01:51:06,312
I think the most significant...
It's when David Lattin made his dunk shot -

1425
01:51:06,381 --> 01:51:08,212
that's what really got us going.

1426
01:51:08,283 --> 01:51:12,481
And I went up, and he grabbed it,
and he just kept going up and up and up.

1427
01:51:12,554 --> 01:51:14,545
And he just dunked it
over the top of me.

1428
01:51:14,623 --> 01:51:18,559
He put it down with such ferocity
that it intimidated me.

1429
01:51:18,627 --> 01:51:23,462
And I did tell David before the game,
if he hadn't run over somebody,

1430
01:51:23,532 --> 01:51:26,933
that I wanted him to tear the rim off
a couple of times.

1431
01:51:27,002 --> 01:51:33,168
But those two steals by Bobby Joe Hill
broke our back

1432
01:51:33,241 --> 01:51:37,439
and reinforced what the reality was.

1433
01:51:37,512 --> 01:51:40,879
And the reality was this:

1434
01:51:40,949 --> 01:51:43,110
They were bigger and they were better

1435
01:51:43,185 --> 01:51:47,121
and they were more talented and they were
quicker. They were a better team.

1436
01:51:47,189 --> 01:51:50,750
Kentucky was kind of a tough team
to match up against.

1437
01:51:50,826 --> 01:51:53,659
See, that was a very, very quick team.

1438
01:51:53,728 --> 01:51:58,927
And I played the guys
that I felt we could win with.

1439
01:51:59,000 --> 01:52:02,731
We ran out there.
And what I saw was wall-to-wall people.

1440
01:52:04,139 --> 01:52:07,870
The reporter was white.
The cheerleaders was white.

1441
01:52:07,943 --> 01:52:10,707
The referee was white.
The camera people was white.

1442
01:52:10,779 --> 01:52:16,240
It was an atmosphere that could have been
real hostile for us if we allowed it to be.

1443
01:52:16,318 --> 01:52:22,814
I feel that this game was probably
the Emancipation Proclamation of 1966.

1444
01:52:22,891 --> 01:52:28,386
And it wasn't until history started to talk
about this game, you know, in that context,

1445
01:52:28,463 --> 01:52:31,455
that we realized we were part
of something that was bigger

1446
01:52:31,533 --> 01:52:33,694
than just five blacks and five whites.

1447
01:52:33,768 --> 01:52:38,102
Black ballplayers were thought of
as inferior.

1448
01:52:38,173 --> 01:52:43,941
You know, can't work under pressure. You
know, rip 'em a little bit, and they'll fold.

1449
01:52:44,012 --> 01:52:48,540
That was the way that a white person
was thinking back then,

1450
01:52:48,617 --> 01:52:52,075
that we couldn't compete
with the white players.

1451
01:52:52,154 --> 01:52:55,317
We experienced a lot of racism
during that season.

1452
01:52:55,390 --> 01:53:02,728
People would spit at you,
and fans would call us niggers, coons...

1453
01:53:03,965 --> 01:53:09,096
And the world looked at it
in that perspective -

1454
01:53:09,171 --> 01:53:13,437
the white team verses this black team.
For us.

1455
01:53:13,508 --> 01:53:16,534
We were playing for much more
than what they were playing for.

1456
01:53:16,611 --> 01:53:19,546
They were playing
for just another championship.

1457
01:53:19,614 --> 01:53:23,948
We were playing to prove that it doesn't
make any difference what color you were -

1458
01:53:24,019 --> 01:53:28,718
if you're given the opportunity,
you could do anything.

1459
01:53:28,790 --> 01:53:32,749
If I could turn back the hands of time,

1460
01:53:32,827 --> 01:53:39,596
I would have love to have gone over
to the Kentucky players

1461
01:53:39,668 --> 01:53:41,795
and shaken their hands.

1462
01:53:41,870 --> 01:53:44,805
Not to patronize them, you know?

1463
01:53:44,873 --> 01:53:48,809
And not to say,
"Thank you for giving me an opportunity."

1464
01:53:48,877 --> 01:53:52,369
You didn't give us this opportunity.
We earned this, see.

1465
01:53:52,447 --> 01:53:57,475
I'm proud to be part of this portrayal
of a great, great man in Don Haskins

1466
01:53:57,552 --> 01:54:02,080
and, you know, players
who simply cared about being great

1467
01:54:02,157 --> 01:54:05,422
and wanting to separate themselves
from the pack

1468
01:54:05,493 --> 01:54:10,089
and wanting to do something unique.

1469
01:54:10,165 --> 01:54:14,261
And to leave footprints in the sand.
They've done that, man.

1470
01:54:14,336 --> 01:54:16,463
They've done that.
