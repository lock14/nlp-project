1
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,400
I'm offbase, bound for Arctic North.

2
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,600
We'll be out scouting.

3
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:48,200
There's plenty out here.
It's just a matter of finding the right one.

4
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,600
If we can find a base up here somewhere
that looks like it'll be workable,

5
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,200
I'll go ahead
and set down on the top.

6
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,200
7601. This is one of
the highest peaks out here.

7
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,800
Let's go see if we can get in up there.

8
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,600
That sticks up above everything.
Oh, it's gonna be "nukin" up there.

9
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,400
I could see somebody doing that,
if the conditions are right.

10
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,800
It'd be one of the hairier lines,
I can guarantee that.

11
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,800
Gotta play a really fine line
getting in and getting back out.

12
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,200
Feels good to be back in A.K.

13
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:06,600
Alaska's so good because of the long runs
and really steep runs.

14
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:11,000
And it has tons of terrain.
It's just a mecca for
free-riding snowboarding.

15
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:26,400
I didn't know it was going to
be, like, bam, bam, bam, all around.

16
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:28,600
It's freakin'amazing.

17
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,800
I'm just looking to have
an awesome time and learn a lot...

18
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,400
and hopefully gain some new skills.

19
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,800
I think everyday is going to be,
like, the best day of my life.
You know?

20
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:01,800
This is really where all the gnarliest stuff
I've ever done happened, you know,

21
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,800
where I really pinned it to the wall
and, like- and threw down.

22
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:11,200
When you're sitting down in the lodge
or at your house thinking about it,

23
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:14,000
you have a lot of delusions of grandeur.

24
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,800
And then, the closer you get
to the top of that mountain,
a lot of that stuff melts away...

25
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,800
and you're just trying to survive.

26
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,600
Look at that track.
Look at that track right there.

27
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:35,200
It's really strange to start out
as a beginner again at a new thing.

28
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:37,600
I know nothing about the mountain.

29
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,800
And the scariest part about it is,
you can't just, like, go on pure luck in Alaska.

30
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,800
'Cause that doesn't really work.

31
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:50,200
Oh, man, this is gonna be so much fun.

32
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,600
Can't wait to hook up with the Farm.

33
00:07:56,600 --> 00:08:00,600
Can't wait to hang out with Terje,
and meeting Shawn and Hannah.

34
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,600
You know, I've seen them on TV
and in the mags and movies and stuff,

35
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:06,800
and I'm stoked to
actually get up there and ride,
take them to my backyard.

36
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:16,400
Anytime you can get four generations
of talent and knowledge and ability together,

37
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,400
it's gonna be explosive.

38
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:46,000
Just to be back here with all these guys,
you know, especially Farm
back on our home terrain,

39
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:50,400
it's special - it's one of those
once in a lifetime reunion trips
that you only dream about.

40
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:54,800
And with Terje here, somebody that,
you know, I hold in the highest regards...

41
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,800
He's the best snowboarder
in the world, really.

42
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,600
Terje has been like the guy
I've always looked up to...

43
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,000
because he was the best
in the pipe and in the park.

44
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
He was always backcountry riding.

45
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,000
He's a pretty reserved
and pretty low-key dude.

46
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,600
Once you get him out there,
I mean, he's just like a cat. He flies.

47
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:20,000
Shaun and Hannah
being here for their first time,
and their, you know, freestyle ability level...

48
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
it's a once-in-a-lifetime deal.

49
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,600
There's a big gap here.
We're talking 20 years.

50
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,000
I think that all goes away,
really, once you get up here
and start riding together.

51
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,400
It's great for me. It just makes me
feel young, even though I'm old.

52
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:38,800
Nick and Farmer is one of
the pioneers from Alaska.

53
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,600
They've been here for a lot in the past.

54
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,600
And it helps a lot
having that experience here.

55
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:48,600
Back in the old days,
it was free and wild, you know.

56
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:52,200
It really was. It was carefree,
and everything was the first descent.

57
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,200
You know where you were going, there
was no other person ever has ridden.

58
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,800
Nick just was all about Alaska.

59
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
He just knew
that's what he wanted to do.

60
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,800
Now he's been guiding for 13 years.

61
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:08,800
He didn't even ride a resort ever.
He just rode-pow! Rode choppers.

62
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,800
I'm stoked just to see...

63
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,600
that the top freestyle performers
are willing to come up here...

64
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,200
and risk their lives just to ride
and get better that way.

65
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:29,600
If you just take it from a money aspect
or your investment,

66
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:33,000
and you look at this Shaun White dude
and he's, like, worth all this dough,

67
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,200
and I'm thinking, I can't believe they're
even gonna let him come up here,

68
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:40,800
'cause we all know that people have
been taken out by mountains like this.

69
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,800
Back in A.K.
Beautiful day

70
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,200
Remember what happened last time
we stayed in this cabin, Farmer.

71
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,200
What happened?

72
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,600
Look at this view.

73
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,600
Holy schizzel.

74
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,000
Pop-a-whizzle.

75
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:04,200
Yeah, Nick!
Yeah, Farm.

76
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,200
Back again.

77
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,200
Which do you like more, Hannah?
NSYNC or Boys II Men?

78
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,000
I would have to say Boys II Men.

79
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
Oh, yeah!

80
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,200
Something like this with, you know,

81
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,000
all these generations of snowboarders,
is definitely historical.

82
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,200
It's priceless.
It really is.

83
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,800
In the 1970's, snowboarding emerged
from the backwoods of America.

84
00:11:55,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It was an unknown sport with roots
based on freedom, flow, self expression...

85
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,200
and a lifestyle that offered a truly
unique feeling that defied description.

86
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,400
During its brief, but chaotic history,

87
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:12,000
snowboarding would battle the establishment,
overcome prejudice and fght to keep its soul.

88
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,800
And in just 25 years
it would spread around the world...

89
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:18,000
and change the face of sports
as we know it today.

90
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:21,200
Snowboarding is so young,
and it came about so quickly,

91
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,600
that there wasn't really a chance...

92
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,200
for the history to lay itself down
and be concrete.

93
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:30,400
Any town you go in in the U.S.,

94
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,400
there's always some old-timer
that comes up with a story like,

95
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:36,400
"Oh, I was the first guy
to ever snowboard.

96
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:39,800
I took a water ski and I cut the back off
and I put a rope on there.
I invented snowboarding."

97
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,400
I'm one of those guys
that's, like, I'm not the inventor.

98
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:47,200
I'll never say I'm the inventor.
I'll never say I'm the first.

99
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:52,800
There's always been somebody before you
that's had the same idea or something similar.

100
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,600
To me, it was more of an evolution.

101
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,800
Snowboarding has been around
longer than any of us even know,
maybe over a hundred years.

102
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:04,200
I believe that snowboarding's
more about the pioneers that started it.

103
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,600
Jake influenced the growth
of snowboarding on the East Coast.

104
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,200
Tom Sims and Chuck Barfoot influenced
the growth of snowboarding on the West Coast.

105
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,600
And then a sport was born.

106
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
He was a strange breed.

107
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,800
"Individualist" would be an understatement.

108
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,800
Jake Burton was definitely
one of the visionaries,

109
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,200
if not the main one
to put the sport over the top.

110
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,600
I got exposed to the whole concept
of snowboarding through the Snurfer.

111
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,600
The Snurfer was a product
that was made in the '60s.

112
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:46,600
It had no bindings,
and the early ones had no fins.
So it was just almost rodeo style.

113
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,200
But there was something there.

114
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,200
Tom was coming from a surfg
and skateboarding background.

115
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,200
He went about it a different way.

116
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:01,000
I wanted to be able to surf the board.

117
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,000
Well, surfing in those days
was all about nose riding.

118
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,000
So, I didn't think of
having a big kick on the front.

119
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,000
I just wanted to be able to hang fve
and ride across the hill.

120
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:14,800
Looking back, it's kind of amazing
I didn't just grab a water ski out of our garage...

121
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,800
and go ride it down the snow.

122
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,400
'Cause it would have saved
many years of development for me.

123
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:26,000
It was a process of developing
product that could stop
and turn right and turn left.

124
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Definitely a lot of creativity
and a lot of failure.

125
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:49,000
By the end of the '70s,
the pioneers had firmly laid down the roots.

126
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:53,000
But snowboarding's future
and its survival remained uncertain.

127
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,400
People didn't even know what it was.
There was no instructors, no lessons.

128
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,200
There was no set way to do it.
There was no book.

129
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:06,000
There was so much variation
in where it was going.

130
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:09,600
'Cause snowboarding
wasn't really a sport yet.
It was only a few of us doing it.

131
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,200
Ah! Digger! Yeah!

132
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:16,200
It was a pretty tight fraternity,
and we were all passionate about the sport.

133
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,000
But there wasn't this feeling of sort of,
hey, we're building something.

134
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,400
We were just riding and, unknowingly,
progressing the sport at an incredible rate.

135
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:43,000
This is a map of the Chugach Range here.

136
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,400
The Chugach is just one of
many, many mountain ranges in Alaska.

137
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:50,600
Whatever you want's out there.
If you want cornices, they're out there.
If you want wind lips, it's out there.

138
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,800
And the whole thing is, just make sure
you find the one that you want.

139
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:59,800
Back in the early days,
when everything was untouched,

140
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,200
you could just go
right across the street
and get an untouched mountain.

141
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,800
This is a good example
of most of the runs up here.

142
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Steep, gnarly at the top. You cannot see
your first four or five turns.

143
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,400
But once you get over that edge,
everything comes into place.

144
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,000
Looks pretty steep,
that one mountain right there.

145
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:22,000
It's always going to look steeper to your eye
when you're flying in a helicopter
or when you're looking at a photo.

146
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,600
It's still going to be steep,
but not as steep as...

147
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,600
To me it works opposite.
Really?

148
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:29,400
I get into it, but, damn, this is steep.
This is steeper than I thought.

149
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:33,800
That's what I'm concerned with...
going off,like, a wind lip
or something and then just...

150
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:39,400
'Cause I've never really
landed in powder that often.
Like, landing and then rolling.

151
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:44,000
Go at your own pace.
You want to come back here.
You want to ride here again next year.

152
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:47,000
This place is gonna show you
where your limits might be.

153
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,000
Just ride to your ability level.

154
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:54,400
Which, you're all
the best riders in the world
in the freestyle genre.

155
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:57,800
And you can be the best riders in the world
in this free-riding genre too.

156
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:01,200
I don't know... I've never really been in
a controlled environment...

157
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:05,000
where I had to watch out
for upcoming stuff...

158
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:09,400
and look forward and be, like,
"I gotta think about this before I do it"
instead of just go for it.

159
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:14,200
Gotta actually visualize
and map it out inside my head.

160
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,200
If you can see the bottom, follow Farm.

161
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:22,000
- If you can't see the bottom, don't follow Farm.
- Don't follow Farm.

162
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:34,200
Alaska, to me, to my friends,
is the pinnacle of snowboarding.

163
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,400
There's nothing
as big and vast and grand.

164
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:42,200
Once we got here,
we knew that's where we wanted to be.
It was like, God, this is rad.

165
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:46,400
Pretty much everything you can ask for,
like a big mountain rider -

166
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:49,200
somebody who wants to have
a really good time on a snowboard.

167
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,200
There's so many
undiscovered mountains out there still
that no one's even seen.

168
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:01,200
It's just unfathomable
how many mountains are out there.

169
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:06,400
Once you ride powder, you never forget it.
It's like a drug. It brings you back every time.

170
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,800
I'm a little scared.
At first, I was really scared.

171
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:18,400
Like, man,
I've never done this stuff before!

172
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,800
It's just such a different mind-set out here.
You get a respect for how big everything is.

173
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,600
Avalanches are our biggest concerns.

174
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:41,600
Crevasses. It's always scary.
You never know what to expect.

175
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:44,400
You just have to know your outs,
know where your safe zones are.

176
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,200
You have to be aware
that something can go wrong.

177
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,600
And when it does,
it's usually catastrophic.

178
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,200
You'll never be totally
comfortable up here. Never.

179
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:56,400
And if you are, you shouldn't be here,
because all around you the mountains are alive.

180
00:18:56,400 --> 00:19:01,800
Unless you're fully prepared to be
in a situation oflife or death,

181
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,800
you shouldn't be up here.

182
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:20,000
You can't get lulled
into a sense of anything being routine
up here, because it's not.

183
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:23,000
When you're flying and you're
getting on top of these mountains,

184
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,600
you better pay attention
to what the hell is going on.

185
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:31,000
Because one mistake is going to cost you
your life or your friend's life.

186
00:19:56,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Biggest thing that would bum me out
is if somebody got hurt or killed up here...

187
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,600
in my backyard, in the place
that I've been riding for 15 years.

188
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:09,000
It's always been my thing.
I feel like the mother hen out here,
and, you know, I would feel responsible.

189
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:13,200
It always crossed my mind that I'd end up
coming out here when I was a lot older.

190
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:17,600
I always thought that I'd master everything
and then take over on this thing.

191
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:21,600
I think it'd be a good time for me
now, though, to get some experience.

192
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,200
If something spectacular happens
or it's obviously just got to be that way,
then I'm ready to throw down like that.

193
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,800
But at the same time,
I'm not going to try to kill myself, really.

194
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,400
At least until towards
the end of the project.

195
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,800
You're out of control.

196
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,600
Oh, man.

197
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,000
Big mountain riding
is definitely in my blood.

198
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,200
He likes to come back here,
but he'll never really ever live here.

199
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:15,800
Because he's got to either have
the mountains or the ocean, I think.

200
00:21:15,800 --> 00:21:20,200
If I didn't get to
come back home to my parents,
I'd probably... I'd be in a box.

201
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,400
A cardboard box by the Dumpster.

202
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:34,400
Shawn's favorite sign in the whole world
is the store that has... What, Shawn?

203
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,200
Guns, liquor, ammo!

204
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:40,200
Pull!

205
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,200
You won't get that.
I knew you wouldn't get that.

206
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,800
I thought we were going this way!
We're going to.

207
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,000
Pull!
There it goes.

208
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,000
Hey!

209
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:54,600
Going back to Alaska for me is...
I wouldn't call it a comeback 'cause I've
been here the whole time, you know.

210
00:21:54,800 --> 00:21:57,600
But it's gonna be
an excellent opportunity.

211
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,800
I'm excited just to get up there
and do some chopper time.

212
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,800
Yeah, I want to show everybody
that I've still got some skills.

213
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:11,800
And for sure up there, I know I can...
you know, I can get with anybody
up on a big mountain.

214
00:22:11,800 --> 00:22:14,600
Pull!

215
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,800
I knew you'd miss.

216
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:21,200
Oh, you got it on the second one.
Nothing wrong with that.
How do you like me now?

217
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,200
Shawn had this
antiestablishment thing.

218
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,200
And that's what appealed
to all the young people.

219
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:33,000
He gave them a sense
of a free-riding spirit...

220
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:37,400
that did what he and they thought
was the right way...

221
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:39,800
to do and express yourself.

222
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,400
The bad downside to that would be,

223
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,800
you have to live up to some
pre-concept that people have.

224
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:50,000
So everywhere you go, they expect you
to, like, break bottles over your head
or something, you know?

225
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,000
Or just do something crazy.

226
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:54,000
That was the hard part to deal with.

227
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,000
And I think that's
one of the reasons why...

228
00:22:56,200 --> 00:23:00,400
among the...
what I want to call the subculture...
I'll say the snowboard culture...

229
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:04,000
that's why he's been able to
retain the following that he has.

230
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,600
I came out in a movie
called Totally Board One.

231
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,200
I think when that movie came out,
it really did rock the industry.

232
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:17,600
I ended up doing that Mount Baker
Road Gap, which was a mythical beast.

233
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,800
Maybe some people had done it,
but, mostly, people just talked about it.

234
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,200
And that's when I realized
that was for me.

235
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,800
I just became a big mountain rider.

236
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:42,600
I ended up getting some money,
starting getting paid to snowboard.
I couldn't believe it, you know?

237
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,800
I'm getting checks year round, you know.
I'm getting checks in the summer.

238
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,000
Even before that,
I was already a little bit out there.

239
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,600
And then now,
this was like gas on the fire.

240
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,400
I always told him,

241
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,400
you know, you can't just go out here
and do what you want to do.

242
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,000
When you're in the corporate world,
that doesn't always work.

243
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,200
And it cost him dearly.

244
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:18,200
I never had a plan.
I didn't even care about money.
I just wanted to have a good time.

245
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,400
And my good time ended.

246
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:26,400
If your, like, fairy tale goes wrong,
then you have to have a backup plan,
and I really didn't.

247
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,800
We actually bought
our first snowboards together.

248
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:36,800
I think Joe bought
both of them, actually.

249
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:40,800
Well, I'd just wrecked his car.
I backed it into a telephone pole.

250
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:44,000
But I'd already wrecked his car
way before.

251
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,200
So his mom was paying me
some money,

252
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,000
and we went and bought
snowboards with it
instead of fixing his car.

253
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,200
Shawn has never quit
pursuing what he liked.

254
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,200
He has stayed right there.
He's done it and done it.

255
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,000
And I used to think, well, he'll finally
say, "That's it," and throw up his hands.

256
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,400
He never has.

257
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,000
And as far as I'm concerned now, as old
as he is and what he's been doing,
he never will.

258
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,200
The early days of snowboarding...

259
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,200
were definitely something
that can never be duplicated.

260
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:17,000
It's like rock and roll in the '50s
or something, you know?

261
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,400
People didn't even really know
quite what it was.

262
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:24,400
And I'm just fortunate to have
lived through it and been part of it.

263
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:48,000
The next wave of snowboarders
was inspired by the hard-charging
skate and punk movements of the '80s.

264
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:53,400
These antiestablishment influences
would fuel a clash of cultures
that would last for over a decade.

265
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,000
Snowboarding was a direct
descendant of skateboarding.

266
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:59,400
Definitely surfing had its place
in influencing what snowboarding did.

267
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,200
But as soon as people fgured out
how it would actually ride on snow,

268
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,200
they wanted to do skate tricks.

269
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,200
It was all about slashing
and finding walls...

270
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:19,600
and trying those skate maneuvers
on my snowboard.

271
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,600
I think it was a pretty rowdy crowd
at the beginning.

272
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,800
Snowboarding was basically,
you know, just punk rock kids
just wanting to go out and thrash,

273
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,600
be aggressive
and just try to express themselves.

274
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,600
They're, like, a lot of kids
with a lot energy.

275
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:39,000
The music we were listening to
told us to, you know, thrash, have fun.
Fuck authority.

276
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,600
Freeze!
Not that funny.

277
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:45,000
This whole, like, anti-authority movement...

278
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,800
definitely pushed the sport
in the direction of free thinking -
you'd go and do what you wanted to do.

279
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,000
The sport was yours to mold.

280
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:58,600
We were stoked to be a part
of something that felt like our own.
It wasn't welcome at all from the skiers.

281
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,400
Is that good enough?
I think so.

282
00:27:03,800 --> 00:27:06,800
I think when snowboarding came along...

283
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:12,600
and the skier establishment
saw this new thing that they
really didn't understand,

284
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,200
they couldn't help
but reject it and try to ban it.

285
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,000
I remember the first day
we went snowboarding.
We weren't allowed on the ski lifts.

286
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,600
So we hiked up along the side of the run.

287
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:28,600
And I remember getting heckled
from the skiers, and that look, like,
what are they riding on?

288
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:31,400
There was less than half a dozen
ski areas...

289
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:36,000
that allowed snowboarding
on planet Earth in 1982 and 1983.

290
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,600
The ski industry
thought that this was a fad -
"We want nothing to do with this."

291
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:45,400
I'd get letters from ski companies
saying, "Stop making these things."

292
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:48,800
We knew we were entitled to it.
I think there was this feeling
that it was going to happen.

293
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,600
But, yeah, when big resorts caved in
you'd get a phone call...

294
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,600
"Hey, we can get on Vail."
And it was, like, "No way!"
It was such cool news at the time.

295
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,400
All of the sudden there was
these weird people on their hill,
and they didn't follow a tradition in skiing.

296
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:16,800
We were taking creative lines
down the mountain
that skiers weren't taking.

297
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:21,200
They thought we were going to
injure ourselves or injure some other people.

298
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,600
Which was not really the case.

299
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:32,000
Was there a prejudice from
skiers towards snowboarders?
I think absolutely.

300
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:35,600
Snowboarders seem to be
a little wilder and take up more room.

301
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,600
We were standing in line
and three of them cut in front of us.

302
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,400
We just didn't want to bug with them
because we thought they
might have guns or something.

303
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:46,400
And I think, as I look back in my career,
when it was really a bad boy image,

304
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:50,400
snowboarders, I must admit,
deserved some of the criticism
they were getting.

305
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,000
They're looking down at you,
and you like that, though,
when you're a kid.

306
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,200
"Yeah, I'm a scumbag.
I'm riding a snowboard."

307
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,200
What it did is gave you
that angst and that energy
to go out and prove them wrong.

308
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,400
You know, prove to them
that you could go out and enjoy it
just as much or more than they could.

309
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,400
There was some behavior
and attitude problems.

310
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,400
There was a lot of language
from both sides.

311
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:13,200
I hope you get hit in the face.
You're an asshole to everyone
who goes by here.

312
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,600
You got a kid with
a lot of freedom in his mind...

313
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,200
and someone turning around,
telling him, you know, "I hate snowboarders."

314
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:21,800
So, he turns around and is, like,
"I'm going to do what I want."

315
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,800
And then it turned into,
like, almost a mental war.

316
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:30,000
They just weren't ready to let go
of their skis and get on a snowboard.

317
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,000
Even though
I'm a little bit of a geezer,

318
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,000
I've been snowboarding myself
full-time for six years.

319
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,000
I've never been back on skis.

320
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:42,400
I took it up when I was 60
and just ride with
all the young guys around here.

321
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:47,000
It's great.
I've been totally hooked for six years,
and I just don't ski anymore.

322
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,000
Usually, I don't ride with people
in these mountains...

323
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,000
unless they're really good
at using all the safety equipment -

324
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,000
probe pole, beacon, harness.

325
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,200
You need to know who's in your group
and what kind of skills they have
with this type of gear,

326
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,000
because it could be my life
that they're trying to save.

327
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,200
Seven-four!
Seven-one!

328
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,800
Me and Farm
dug them both out in four minutes.

329
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,200
That's survivable time with no
brain damage or anything like that.
Maybe some hypothermia.

330
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,800
So if they beat four minutes,
then I'm gonna say, "Yeah,
they were listening real good."

331
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,800
If they don't beat four minutes
and it comes to seven, to eight,

332
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,600
now, potentially,
we have a body recovery instead of,
you know, saving your friend.

333
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:36,800
All right, this way.
So, we'll see.

334
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:39,000
Are we getting so close?
I'm finding it.

335
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:42,400
Okay. There you go.

336
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,200
Here it is - point-six.
Dig it.

337
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,800
I hit something.
Is it squishy?

338
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:52,800
Oh, yes.
It's right there, baby!
Time!

339
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,800
Did you get it?
Yeah!

340
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,800
Every time I've been told about
the backcountry, they're just
like, "Listen, you know,

341
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:03,000
even though your friend's buried,
you still have to take your time
and just find him."

342
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:06,400
I mean, there's no use in just panicking
and going like this everywhere.

343
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,400
It just doesn't do anything.

344
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:11,400
They found the beacon in two minutes.
They found it quicker than me and Nick.

345
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:14,200
So I'm sure they can handle it.

346
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,600
A while ago, Shaun and I
were talking about, like, whoa,
we've never done this before.

347
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:23,400
Like, we don't wanna die up there.

348
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:28,000
Not bugging out about it,
but being, like, I don't know -
feelin' a little stressed on it.

349
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:32,600
You know, I want to be safe,
but I still want to learn a lot.
I want to learn about backcountry riding.

350
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,800
And I want to progress, you know.

351
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,600
This is called Kiwijunior.

352
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:45,800
It's a good little run.
It's not too much exposure, but there are
places where you can get hurt, definitely.

353
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:48,800
It's probably some of
the best snow that we've found.

354
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:51,800
So, there's four or five lines
in here that we can rip.

355
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:54,800
And it's just kind of a little warm-up
for the first shot of the day.

356
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,800
Once you drop in, the slough's
going to be on either side of it.

357
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,800
So you gotta get on the middle.

358
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,800
If you don't get on the middle,
you're gonna get pulled off either side.

359
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,200
There's a little
chocolate chip to the left.
See it?

360
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:11,200
We land the helicopter,
and you look at this big mountain face
and you're, like, "Okay, pick your line."

361
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:15,200
And I'm trying to look at the mountain
that way, but I don't see it.

362
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:19,400
There's just so much going on.
It's hard to focus.

363
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,000
They are so out of their element up here.

364
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,600
It's a gut-wrenching feeling
when you know they can do it,

365
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:34,000
but are they gonna be able to do it?

366
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,600
Three, two, one.

367
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:48,600
It's just different being up here...

368
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,200
because it's no longer
just, like, little runs.

369
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:54,800
It's like every run's its own mountain.
I'm not used to it at all.

370
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,000
That cliff at the bottom was huge!

371
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,000
It was just a flat...

372
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,000
I'm, like, shaking.
That was a big one.

373
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,000
I came off there just, like, oh, no!

374
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:47,800
And it's so much bigger than it looks.

375
00:33:47,800 --> 00:33:50,200
I'm getting into it though.
It's so much fun.

376
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,800
Let's do it again.

377
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:57,200
It was probably one of the
coolest rides I've ever done in my life
'cause it was just so new to me.

378
00:33:57,400 --> 00:34:02,000
I don't know, afterwards,
I felt like I'd accomplished this huge feat.

379
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:05,000
Even though it was, like,
one of the mellow runs of Alaska.

380
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:08,200
I just felt, still, that it was
just such a big thing for me.

381
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,600
So many things could have gone wrong,
but they didn't.

382
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,800
There's a great line for Hannah.

383
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,800
Just tell her to almost follow my tracks.
Keep them on her skier's left side.

384
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,400
And just... tell her just to trust it.

385
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:35,000
Tell her to trust me
and just stay on that ridge
and just slowly work her way down it.

386
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,600
Yeah, Hannah!

387
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:05,400
Nick's always given me tips, no matter what,
even if I don't ask for them.

388
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,000
He'll just fill me
with some good information.

389
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,000
And he's just making sure I'm safe.

390
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:15,000
I really appreciate
having someone behind my back,
even though I just met him.

391
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:19,000
Oh, yeah, guys. Yeah, Nick.
Thanks for radioing up
and reassuring me. That was cool.

392
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:22,000
I was all, like,
"Yeah! He said it's good!"
Good job.

393
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,200
Me and Farm, just for us
to come back up here...

394
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,200
to where our eyes got opened...

395
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:36,600
We told ourselves back in '89
that this is it -
we will always come back here.

396
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,200
Just to be able to hang with him
in these mountains,
where we both got our start...

397
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,800
and our end of our career,

398
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:07,000
it's - it's awesome.

399
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:10,600
He's just one of a kind, man.
He's a one-of-a-kind character.

400
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,800
If you ever wanna go ride
a snowboard with somebody,

401
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:17,800
he's one of
the funnest guys to ride with.

402
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,800
Yeah, the first day, me and Shawn
went up for this afternoon run.

403
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,200
It's kind of cool to go with Shawn.
He's got such good skills.

404
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:49,400
So, I was not, like, afraid he was
gonna not make it or adapt to it.
I think that was the least problem.

405
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,400
I was kind of stoked
I'd probably get to go first.

406
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,600
The worst was, standing up
at the top with Terje...

407
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:23,600
and then I'm just
thinking over in my head,
like, my mom and dad, like...

408
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:26,600
I'd gotten, like,
four sit-down talks with them...

409
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:31,200
"Okay, I know Terje is gonna go with you.
Don't let him take you up anywhere."

410
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:37,000
I was just standing up there like, wow,
I'm just doing the total opposite
of what everybody's told me.

411
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,600
It's just kind of getting over that fear
of what everybody's telling me...

412
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,200
and just kind of
taking my own look at it.

413
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,600
I'll be honest -
I had a little shake going.

414
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,600
I was, like...

415
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:34,400
Like right before you drop in,
like, the X-Games pipe,
you got a little bit of a shake going.

416
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,400
And that's exactly what it was.

417
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:40,000
I was just like, okay, well, if it slides,
you're just gonna fly that way.

418
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:43,400
Oh! It was fun.

419
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,400
It's just such
a different mind-set out here.

420
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:50,200
I'm such a far ways away from
where I was just a couple weeks ago.

421
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,600
Grand marshal.

422
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,000
You're an honored guest here
of Mountain Dew...

423
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,000
at the final
Mountain Dew Southern 500.

424
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:15,400
And you'll give the command to
start the 43 engines this afternoon.

425
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,400
Yeah, the "start your engines!"

426
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,000
Jeff, real quick.
Shaun White, our grand marshal.

427
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,000
What's going on? Nice to meet you.
Good to have you here.
Hey, thanks.

428
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:27,000
You're awesome,
what you do on that stuff.

429
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,000
Actually, my snowboarding boots
are your boots.

430
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:31,800
Oh, really?
That's awesome!

431
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,400
Yeah! Did you hear that?
That was awesome!

432
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:39,000
Oh, dude, Gordon's
gettin' a snowboard in the mail.

433
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:43,200
And now, race fans, will you please
welcome back Shaun White.

434
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:46,200
Ladies and gentlemen,
please join me in saluting...

435
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,800
the running of the final
Mountain Dew Southern 500!

436
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,000
Gentlemen, start your engines!

437
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,800
I never would have thought
being grand marshal at NASCAR.
You know what I mean?

438
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,600
There's just so many opportunities
within snowboarding
that I'm starting to realize now.

439
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:22,400
He is a mainstream celebrity,
whether he likes it or not.
He's on TV. Kids know his name.

440
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,800
They know that he's one of the
best snowboarders of all time.

441
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,000
He's also one of the most amazing
skateboarders we've ever seen.

442
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,400
I did Japan for, like, 10 days.

443
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:46,400
I got home from that for, like,
a day or two - straight to NASCAR.

444
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,800
And then after NASCAR,
here we are - Hollywood.

445
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:56,000
Oh, no.

446
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:59,000
The only thing that wears me out
is just, like, the time zones,

447
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,000
because, like, you get home
and you want to sleep
and then you got to stay up.

448
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,600
There's the back.

449
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,800
I hate looking at the whole calendar...

450
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,800
'cause it's just, like,
you look at this whole calendar...

451
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:12,400
and the whole thing's just covered
in red ink and you're, like,

452
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,600
"Oh, I have to do all that."

453
00:41:14,800 --> 00:41:17,800
I just try to take
the one month at a time.

454
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:20,200
Stand by.

455
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:24,000
I feel that when the mainstream
comes into snowboarding,
it's really good, I feel.

456
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,600
Because the more money
that gets in the sport, it ends up
bringing more things back home.

457
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:31,800
The week has been crazy.

458
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:37,600
The mountains are taking
half their budget to make a sick park,
so kids will show up and ride.

459
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:43,400
And I think that's one of
the coolest parts about the mainstream
coming into our sport.

460
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,600
Shaun White,
two-time defending gold medalist.

461
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:54,000
The man is focused.
He told me at the beginning of the week,
"I am hungry for competition."

462
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,600
We will see ifhe can get it done
and get his third gold.

463
00:41:56,600 --> 00:42:00,400
For me, the X-Games is just something
for me to look forward to.

464
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,800
It's always the biggest event
of the year.

465
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,600
There's so many people
that come out to it.
It's full-on live television.

466
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,800
It's where snowboarding
really came to light.

467
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:16,200
People started to watch the X-Games on TV
and started noticing faces and people.

468
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:23,400
Snowboarding is
the heart and soul of the Winter X-Games,
and it was from the very beginning.

469
00:42:23,600 --> 00:42:28,400
A lot of mainstream sports critics
said these aren't real athletes,
these aren't real sports.

470
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:33,200
But the kids, they're the ones
who have the same regard
for professional snowboarders...

471
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,200
that they have for
any other professional athlete.

472
00:42:56,000 --> 00:42:58,400
When you're on a medium
like ABC's Wide World of Sports...

473
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,600
and it's your run being beamed out
to 1 50 million people,

474
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:07,200
let's face it-if you put it down,
it's going to change your life.

475
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:14,600
If you throw down the hottest run,
you're going to be on SportsCenter.

476
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:17,000
Sports Center.

477
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,200
You getting nervous or what?
I'm sweating it.

478
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:44,000
It's pretty intense.

479
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,000
I train most the year just to
be able to go there and do my thing...

480
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,600
and do the best that I can
at that event.

481
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:52,800
It's the one that I think about the most.

482
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:03,400
You talk to anybody
from mainstream America
who wants a piece of snowboarding,

483
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:06,800
the first question is,
What was your place in the X-Games?

484
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,800
That's pretty much
what it comes down to.

485
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:53,000
Shaun is setting the bar
in every event he does.

486
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,800
It doesn't matter
if it's slopestyle or rail jam,
if it's half-pipe.

487
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,400
I hate to use
the Michael Jordan reference.
We'll say LeBron James.

488
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:08,000
He's like LeBron James
on a snowboard.

489
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,000
Shaun, we love you!

490
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:14,200
I don't think we even have any idea
how big his star's going to be.

491
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:18,400
Anybody know his name?
Shaun White coming home with the gold.

492
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:24,200
If he thought he was famous now,
just wait till the Olympics.

493
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:43,800
Despite growing acceptance,
snowboarding was still underground.

494
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:48,600
In the mid-'80s, early contests
brought together snowboarders
from all over the world,

495
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,400
triggering the sport's
rapid evolution.

496
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:56,000
The U.S. Open was huge for us
on the East Coast.

497
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:00,000
That's where we went to watch
the other guys that were top in the sport
show us what they had.

498
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,200
And it was our chance
to show them what we had.

499
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,800
I started snowboarding up in Tahoe.

500
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:11,400
And not until the first time I went to
my first world championships contest
in Breckenridge...

501
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,600
did I realize that snowboarding
existed anywhere except Tahoe.

502
00:46:14,600 --> 00:46:19,600
There's European snowboarders
and there's the East Coast Burton guys.

503
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:21,800
And there's now bigger hard-core guys.

504
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:27,000
It was just a bunch of people
stoked to see that there were
other people out there doing it.

505
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:31,600
As contests evolved, freestyle
and free-riding became the focus.

506
00:46:31,800 --> 00:46:35,400
These creative, more expressive
styles of riding would become
the driving forces...

507
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:37,400
that would shape snowboarding's future.

508
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:42,600
The whole birth of
freestyle snowboarding came from us
being able to ride half-pipes.

509
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,600
Back in the day,
it was dominated by racing.

510
00:46:45,600 --> 00:46:49,200
Racing became so serious
and you didn't like the people
you were racing against,

511
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,600
and there was all these rivalries.

512
00:46:53,800 --> 00:46:58,800
Half-pipe gave it a chance
for kids to just be kids.

513
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:04,600
The tallest half-pipe
was probably-if it was six feet tall,
that was a pretty damn big half-pipe.

514
00:47:04,600 --> 00:47:06,800
And it was really just a mess.

515
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,000
It was really just,
you know, kind of a mess.

516
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:14,200
Now you go onto these pipes
and they're, like, 20-foot walls,

517
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:17,400
perfectly cut by a pipe dragon.

518
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:21,200
And kids these days get to
ride that kind of stuff everyday.

519
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:32,600
A key element of contests in general
was the fact that you got media out there...

520
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:36,400
and those photographers would
open the eyes of millions of people.

521
00:47:37,400 --> 00:47:41,400
Every single kid would look
at those magazines and go,
"Oh, my God, I want to do that."

522
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:45,600
Magazines were a way to show progression.
It was a way to show trends.

523
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:50,600
It was a way to touch
everyone all over the world about
what was happening in our sport.

524
00:47:51,600 --> 00:47:54,400
But then, with the advent of
the snowboard video, we were like,

525
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,800
Whoa, snowboarding's
way different than the way we do it.
Let's do it that way.

526
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:09,000
When I first started snowboarding,
the stars of the sport, to me,
were the guys that were in the videos.

527
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,400
You know, Damian Sanders,
Craig Kelly, guys like that.

528
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,200
I mean, I would
watch a video 25 times, easy.

529
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,000
Film is the biggest influence
on snowboarding.
Maybe more so than contests.

530
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,000
All of the sudden, there was
this whole generation of snowboarders...

531
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,000
that didn't have to go
and win contests to be sponsored.

532
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,800
We could go free-ride
and go ride powder and experience
more of snowboarding...

533
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:32,000
than just traveling around
doing the contests.

534
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:37,000
You're on fire!

535
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,000
Videos helped to look inside
and see what else what was going on...

536
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,400
besides when the snowboarders
were on the hill...

537
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:44,400
and just more about, like,
their personalities.

538
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:48,400
And that's what grabbed you -
like, these guys are cool.

539
00:48:51,400 --> 00:48:54,400
You can snowboard all day
and just go haywire at night.

540
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,000
And I mean haywire.

541
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,600
The videos were more
geared towards partying...

542
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,000
and the Whiskey movies
and stuff where it's just mayhem.

543
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:16,200
They had a different idea of
what apres-ski activities might be.

544
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,400
Yeah!

545
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:21,800
Basically just being Jackass
before Jackass was even cool.

546
00:49:21,800 --> 00:49:27,200
I knew snowboarding was crazy,
but when you watch those videos
you really know how nuts it was.

547
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,600
And deep down, I think,
I really wanted to be a part of that.

548
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:53,200
Farm ain't playing
He's just gonna be filleting faces

549
00:49:53,200 --> 00:49:56,800
After they drop him off at the top
and he rips it through
the bottom of the bases

550
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:59,200
But that's the way he does it
every day of the week

551
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:02,800
'Cause he's a powder-ridin'
longboard freak, hey

552
00:50:06,600 --> 00:50:11,000
You know, morale goes down a little bit
when the whiteout comes.

553
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,600
We had other things planned to do
and now we can't do them,
so it's just another Chugach notch.

554
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:21,200
Another down day.

555
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:27,400
What's up, Farm?
What do you think, bro?
What are we gonna do?

556
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:32,600
You're gonna get a huge storm.

557
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:35,600
You're gonna get a couple,
three, four days of clearing.
Then you're gonna get some wind.

558
00:50:35,600 --> 00:50:37,800
That's the cycle of these mountains.

559
00:50:37,800 --> 00:50:43,400
You have to be patient, because when
it does break it's going to be
the best that you've ever had.

560
00:50:43,400 --> 00:50:47,600
You got to find things to do around here,
or you're gonna go nuts.

561
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:54,000
As soon as Farm hears the rotors flying,
he'll be the first one dressed and ready to go.
Huh, Farm?

562
00:50:54,200 --> 00:50:56,000
That's right.
See?

563
00:50:56,200 --> 00:51:01,000
Hopefully, it's dumping up top, up high.
I'm sure it probably is.

564
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,800
I didn't know Travis was coming.
He kind of just showed up.
I'm, like, "Yeah!"

565
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,800
He's a good friend of mine,
and he's an awesome rider.

566
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:29,200
I'd heard he might have been coming,
but it's just awesome to have him here.

567
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,200
It's a good crew coming up here...

568
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:35,400
Perata, Farmer, Hannah, having Terje
up here with, like, Shaun White.

569
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,600
All right, let's do it.

570
00:51:37,600 --> 00:51:41,200
He'll ride anything.
He's all about the backcountry.

571
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:44,000
He can do a half-pipe contest
and slope south.

572
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:51,200
Alaska is a place where Travis
can separate himself from other riders.

573
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:54,800
He knows it's the best
for backcountry free-riding.

574
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,000
First couple days we got blue sky, finally,
after the rainy, like, cloudy storminess.

575
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:11,600
I was so happy, you know,
just knowing that we were going up.

576
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,600
Yeah! We're going up!

577
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:18,800
Now that we've had new snow,
it's made everything unstable.

578
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:24,400
It's good 'cause we get a fresh coat,
but it's also bad 'cause it now
makes everything more dangerous.

579
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,000
Yeah, I heard
that it's kind of avalanchey up top.

580
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,400
So today we're just gonna,
I guess, plan a jump.

581
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:55,600
How do I feel about building a kicker
in the Alaskan backcountry?

582
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:59,000
Well, I think
it's a bunch of bullshit myself.

583
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:03,200
But I live by the motto,
don't sweat the petty.

584
00:53:03,400 --> 00:53:05,400
Pet the sweaty.

585
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:08,200
He's got a point.

586
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:13,400
This is probably the most popular part
of snowboarding videos and everything.

587
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,000
Kids go out
and build these jumps, you know?

588
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,000
Dudes like Shawn and Travis Rice here.

589
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:21,600
Terje won't have a problem either.
I'm sure Hannah will do fine.

590
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,200
We'll see.
I don't know, you know.
I could throw out something.

591
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:29,200
I'm a little scared, actually.
I've never really done
this kind of stuff before.

592
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:31,800
Oh, God, no!

593
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,800
Do a couple of those,
you'll be all stretched out.
Yeah.

594
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:40,600
I thought we'd just be
coming up here, we'd build
a little one foot-high, single track jump.

595
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,200
I mean, when did it come to this?
Why do you have to fly a hundred feet?
I don't understand it.

596
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:52,800
Farmer was a little nervous because
he's never really had a jump like this.

597
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:55,000
And the jump was huge.

598
00:53:55,200 --> 00:53:57,000
It was a really big jump.

599
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:05,200
It was just something
that was bringing the whole new wave
of snowboarding right to him,

600
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:08,800
and I don't know
whether he was ready for it or not.

601
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,000
Hannah had never been out
in the backcountry to hit a jump like this,

602
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:16,200
and to start out with that was
just insane 'cause it was... I was scared.

603
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,200
Whenever I'm
put in front of a challenge,
I want to do it.

604
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:53,200
I want to conquer it
and come out of it feeling this sense
of satisfaction that I went for it.

605
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:18,000
It was a really big jump
that any other girl that was up here...

606
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:19,800
would most definitely
back out of.

607
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:23,600
I give her so much credit
for even going for it.

608
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:25,800
It was really scary.

609
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:31,200
I was, like, "Well, Farm went.
I guess I'll go for it."

610
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,600
Let's give you a quick head-to-toe.

611
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,000
Take a deep breath for me.
Careful now.

612
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,400
Does it feel like a broken rib at all?

613
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:41,000
Big mountain skills or hospital bills.

614
00:56:41,200 --> 00:56:43,400
That's the story up here, you know?

615
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,600
Hematoma.
A hematoma. No big deal.

616
00:56:46,600 --> 00:56:49,600
That your bone sticking out?
In the wrong spot?
I don't know.

617
00:56:49,600 --> 00:56:52,200
All the way up.
Yeah, you're gonna have some bruisin'.

618
00:56:52,200 --> 00:56:55,800
A little swelling
right in here right now.

619
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:58,400
Ice him down.

620
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:01,400
You know, it's been a little bit
of a reality check for me too...

621
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:03,800
'cause at my age I can get there
and I have experience...

622
00:57:04,000 --> 00:57:07,000
and I can get down stuff
that a lot of people
wouldn't even consider.

623
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:09,600
And then, on the other hand,
it's like, you know,

624
00:57:09,800 --> 00:57:13,000
maybe it's time
to just relax and chill out.

625
00:57:13,200 --> 00:57:18,000
Which... I'm torn.
Dude, that's gnarly. Gnarly.

626
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:21,400
Those guys are
all stomping it though, huh?
No problem.

627
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,600
You just start to feel it
right after that first 360.

628
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:43,600
I was feeling it.

629
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,400
Did another three even bigger,
and then I was, "Oh, I'm gonna
seven it. I gotta do it."

630
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:02,800
It was definitely one of the biggest
720s I've ever done.

631
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:38,600
It's just, like, "What?"

632
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,000
It's just mind-boggling, man.

633
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:45,200
Really, I mean, I was, like,
"He just greased it, you know?"

634
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:49,400
That was a fun little session.

635
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:53,600
Got quick couple bumps
with the heli and split just in time.

636
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:57,200
Yeah, it worked out probably
better than we had hoped.

637
00:59:03,600 --> 00:59:06,000
A little bit over my head right now.

638
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,200
But, yeah, these guys killed it, man.

639
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:11,400
You have to accept where
you're at in this whole game,

640
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:14,400
so that's hard for me,
but that's what I'm doing, you know.

641
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,400
We'll see.
You never know.

642
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:19,000
It kind ofhurt my pride
a little bit, you know.

643
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,200
Like, when I was
tumbling down that hill,
you just feel it.

644
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:26,800
You know, a fall I had never taken before.
Just kind of bruised my little ego.

645
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,400
Yeah, I grew up
with four older brothers just
charging around, doing stuff.

646
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:34,200
And to come here
and kind of get a sense
of that, like,

647
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:36,600
"Wait up! I want to come!"
You know.

648
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:39,800
So it was a nice,
like, atmosphere for me.

649
00:59:44,200 --> 00:59:47,800
I was born, raised...
I've lived here my whole life -
Belmont, Vermont.

650
00:59:48,000 --> 00:59:50,800
It's just so peaceful up here.

651
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:54,000
I love coming home
after just being on the road.

652
00:59:54,200 --> 00:59:57,800
Do I have pride?
I'm not changing my last name
when I get married.

653
00:59:57,800 --> 01:00:00,000
Keep it Teter forever.

654
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,800
It was nice to have
four older influences to kind
of guide me along, you know?

655
01:00:05,000 --> 01:00:07,400
Are you going to show me
how to ride a rail today?

656
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:10,200
Amen. I've been traveling
with him a lot lately actually.

657
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,600
I'm Hannah's manager and agent,
as well as Abe and Eliijah's.

658
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:16,400
So we've got the Teter family
snowboarding business going on.

659
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:18,400
Abe Teter!

660
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:22,400
Yeah!

661
01:00:22,400 --> 01:00:25,000
We all rode the same first snowboard.
We all learned on it.

662
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,000
There it is.
This is the old man right here.

663
01:00:27,000 --> 01:00:30,000
That thing is awesome.
Look at the size of that puppy!

664
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:32,200
Look at the dust on it.
That's amazing.

665
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:37,000
I mean, four older brothers,
and the only sister.

666
01:00:37,000 --> 01:00:39,200
It's made her pretty
rough and tough.

667
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:41,400
Keeping up with them
all those years,

668
01:00:41,400 --> 01:00:44,000
she was always determined
to be right there with them.

669
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,000
Don't hit me with that.

670
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:48,400
I think Hannah exemplifies competitive.

671
01:00:48,600 --> 01:00:51,200
She is so competitive,
almost to a fault in certain ways.

672
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,200
I mean, she's so competitive
in her head...

673
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:58,400
and so driven to win
and be the best at what she's doing...

674
01:00:58,400 --> 01:01:01,600
that sometimes it takes away
from how much fun she's having.

675
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:05,000
Hannah Teter!

676
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:10,200
- Come on, Sissy.
- Come on, Hannah!

677
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,400
It helps me to have a little support
at the bottom.

678
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:21,600
No matter what happens, it's just
that positive energy type...

679
01:01:21,600 --> 01:01:24,200
that I can get from my family
and no one else, you know?

680
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:26,200
He's a skeezer.

681
01:01:28,200 --> 01:01:30,800
Kill it, man.

682
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:37,800
This is the first time
the backyard in the Teter family
has ever seen rails.

683
01:01:39,600 --> 01:01:42,000
Liden, you are so skeezy.

684
01:01:44,600 --> 01:01:46,600
I think they just
kick-started me, you know?

685
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,000
Like, I started snowboarding
because they were.

686
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:51,400
And then I kind of sprouted off.

687
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:56,600
Over the last couple of years,
Hannah's, like,

688
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:59,400
taken it where we started it
and where those guys started it...

689
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:01,400
and then taken it
to that next level.

690
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:05,400
As her brother,
I just find myself being
just so overwhelmed sometimes.

691
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,800
Like, holy shit, dude!
She is killing it!

692
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:11,200
Like, my little sister's
one of the best snowboarders
in the world,

693
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:13,400
and that's nuts.

694
01:02:28,200 --> 01:02:30,800
As the decade changed,
so did snowboarding.

695
01:02:30,800 --> 01:02:35,200
Increased exposure,
a no-limits attitude
and continued progression...

696
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:38,400
would push the sport to a level
that few had ever imagined.

697
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:42,400
It seemed like overnight
we went from being a threat...

698
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:45,000
to being, like, the saviors
of the ski industry.

699
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:49,200
We were bringing kids back on
to the mountain, and lift ticket sales
started going back up.

700
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,600
It seemed like when something flipped,
it just flipped very quickly.

701
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:56,400
Snowboarding was growing so fast,

702
01:02:56,400 --> 01:03:00,400
and ski resorts started to realize
that they're gonna miss out...

703
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:03,800
if they don't allow snowboarding and they
don't start catering to snowboarders.

704
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:10,200
They started advertising on the radio,
"And we don't allow snowboarders."

705
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:13,000
The year after they were, like,
"And we have a great half-pipe."

706
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,200
And they were, like, completely
kissing ass to snowboarders.

707
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,400
I hate it when they do that.

708
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:20,800
Because all it comes down to
is them making money.

709
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:24,800
The bus was leaving.
You're either gonna be on the bus
or off the bus, financially, on this thing.

710
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,400
Then you saw the exponential growth
of snowboarding,

711
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:31,200
with double-digit increases
every single year.

712
01:03:31,200 --> 01:03:33,800
And who wants to miss that boat,
from a business point of view?

713
01:03:33,800 --> 01:03:36,000
And after all,
we're running a business here.

714
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:43,800
Snowboarding just kind of started
going mainstream a little bit.

715
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,800
There was bigger contests.
There was more prize money.

716
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:52,000
It was such an accelerated path
from sleeping in the cars...

717
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,000
and clipping lift tickets...

718
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:58,600
to be able to get up and ride
to this huge insurgence of money
into the industry.

719
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:02,400
Before I knew it,
we were traveling the world
and forgot how we got there.

720
01:04:02,600 --> 01:04:04,600
'Cause it just
kind of happened overnight.

721
01:04:04,600 --> 01:04:07,600
All of a sudden you started seeing
snowboarding commercials on TV.

722
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:11,000
Why do I use the card?
I spent my whole life
doing things my own way.

723
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,400
American Express never questioned it.

724
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:16,200
Then you started to see snowboarding
more and more and more,

725
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,400
and it was, like, "Oh, shit.
People are into this sport.
Snowboarding's cool!"

726
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:24,400
There's a lot of good things that come from it,
but there's also a lot ofbad things.

727
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:27,400
All these companies
are throwing money at us,
and all of a sudden it's, like,

728
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:31,000
"You'll have all these opportunities,"
which is all cool and everything.

729
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:34,000
But then sometimes
you'd sit back and you're, like,
"Am I selling myself out?

730
01:04:34,200 --> 01:04:37,400
Am I selling out the soul
of snowboarding?"

731
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:02,800
It definitely makes you feel
like you got robbed, in a sense.

732
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:08,400
But now we've reached
this worldly exposure,
where it's actually kind of neat.

733
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:12,600
You know, like,
you have kids all over the world
who respect you for what you do...

734
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:15,200
and admire you.

735
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,600
What had once been an underground
American subculture...

736
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:25,000
soon spread to Europe and Japan
and became a global phenomenon.

737
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:30,400
Europe was more focused on racing,

738
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:32,800
and we were more focused
on the freestyle aspect of it.

739
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:36,200
They rode fast.
They rode some serious big mountains,
a lot of powder.

740
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:41,000
And I think that those riders
brought a lot to the development
of the whole thing.

741
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:48,000
In general, the Europeans embraced it,
I think, a lot quicker than the Americans.

742
01:05:52,600 --> 01:05:57,200
The Japanese people
are amazing, and they're amazingly
fanatical about things that they love.

743
01:05:57,400 --> 01:05:59,600
And they found snowboarding,
and they embraced it,

744
01:05:59,600 --> 01:06:01,600
and they turned us into rock stars.

745
01:06:01,600 --> 01:06:03,800
We had never felt like that
before in the U.S.

746
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:06,200
When you got to Japan,
it was these people...

747
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,800
- They knew your names,
and they were showing up at airports.
- I love you!

748
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:13,200
And, like, asking you
for autographs everywhere!

749
01:06:13,200 --> 01:06:15,200
There's dudes there
that buy six boards a year.

750
01:06:15,400 --> 01:06:20,200
They were just so obsessive.
That definitely fueled that
billion-dollar industry for sure.

751
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:49,200
I don't know.
This isn't really snowboarding.

752
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:54,000
But, uh, it's a show.
It's an event. It's how it goes.

753
01:06:55,000 --> 01:06:57,600
Please welcome...

754
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:02,400
Extreme jump in Tokyo Dome!

755
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:09,400
You know, in the U.S.,
snowboarding is kind of big,

756
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:13,000
but over here,
it's kind of taken to the next level.

757
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,600
And, of course,
it's sold out once again.

758
01:07:15,600 --> 01:07:17,600
That's why it is the best contest.

759
01:07:19,400 --> 01:07:23,200
They have pyrotechnics
and smash a big old gong.

760
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,000
And, like,
Who Wants To Be A Millionaire
lighting going.

761
01:07:36,400 --> 01:07:41,600
Four, three, two, one, start!

762
01:08:12,800 --> 01:08:15,600
When you get to the top
of the dropping deck...

763
01:08:15,600 --> 01:08:17,800
and you look out over,
you know, a sea...

764
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:21,200
of 40,000 Japanese
who are just chanting,

765
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:24,800
uh, it's definitely
a humbling, humbling view.

766
01:08:25,800 --> 01:08:29,400
Travis Rice from Wyoming, U.S.A.!

767
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:32,400
What has snowboarding
come to?

768
01:08:50,800 --> 01:08:54,200
You definitely feed off the crowd.
You know, you get out there,
and there's that many fans.

769
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:58,000
So, of course, you know, you're gonna go
a little bit bigger, a little faster,

770
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,000
try a little harder.

771
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:39,600
It's crazy that snowboarding's
brought me to, like, a place like this...

772
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:43,000
where that many people are that hyped
on what we're doing.

773
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:51,000
Most of the heebie-jeebies
of first coming here and seeing
these big ol' mountains...

774
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:53,000
are pretty much over.

775
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,600
It's nice that we can get out
and get some runs under our belt.

776
01:09:55,600 --> 01:09:59,800
Shaun and Hannah are getting
more and more comfortable
each day they're here.

777
01:09:59,800 --> 01:10:03,600
You know, obviously they don't
have the big mountain experience
the rest of the group has.

778
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:07,600
But from what I've seen so far, you know,
the potential is definitely there.

779
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:12,600
You know,
having Travis here and Terje,
I'll tell you what...

780
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:15,400
It's pretty awesome just to see
how much it's progressed.

781
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:19,800
It's definitely amazing, you know.
Nobody would have ever thought
that the sport would have gone this far.

782
01:10:50,400 --> 01:10:53,200
Well, all right. How was that?

783
01:10:53,200 --> 01:10:57,000
That was really good.
Uh, the snow is super good.

784
01:10:57,000 --> 01:11:00,200
The sunny sides are a little sunbaked,
but other than that,

785
01:11:00,200 --> 01:11:02,600
it's like some wet Tahoe powder.

786
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:07,000
Riding with Travis
was so good because he was so motivated,
you know, just to be up there.

787
01:11:07,000 --> 01:11:09,800
And then, you know,
he's so top of the game right now.

788
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:13,800
You know, that helped a lot,
having him just motivating me.

789
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:32,400
You snowboard long enough,

790
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:36,400
and you get an eye for trying
to fgure out the line.

791
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:40,800
And shredding with Terje...
He's been looking for the line
ever since he was, like, 15.

792
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,800
You always pick the lines
where it's hard to get to.

793
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,600
Or it seems like those are the lines
that are really good.

794
01:12:40,000 --> 01:12:45,000
All right, my line is, I'm dropping
on the, uh, next ridge over...

795
01:12:45,000 --> 01:12:48,000
from what Terje did
on top of that last feature.

796
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,400
I'm gonna air off that
into that landing -

797
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,600
that landing that's getting
shaded right now.

798
01:13:41,800 --> 01:13:43,800
You all right?
Yeah.

799
01:13:43,800 --> 01:13:46,200
Feel good?
Yeah.

800
01:13:46,200 --> 01:13:49,000
Good? If you care,
I've got the power shot.

801
01:13:49,200 --> 01:13:52,000
Yeah?
Yeah. Nice one.

802
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:56,400
Just got to, uh,
keep fighting for those ones.

803
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:59,400
That thing cracked, and I just had...
I knew I had to get to the side.

804
01:13:59,600 --> 01:14:02,600
So, uh, I was able to weasel out.

805
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:08,600
Just, uh... You gotta be persistent,
hold that edge, keep cutting out of it.

806
01:14:08,600 --> 01:14:11,400
You're pretty good at weasling.

807
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,600
That was right where I was trying to go.
Yeah. It was perfect.

808
01:14:13,800 --> 01:14:16,800
Then I just saw everything crack, and it
was, like... The crack was huge. Oh, yeah.

809
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:18,600
Yeah.

810
01:14:18,600 --> 01:14:22,800
It's a big avalanche
to wake up in the morning with,
and it's not gonna stop us.

811
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:26,600
We already knew that
before we came up here -
that there's gonna be avalanches.

812
01:14:26,600 --> 01:14:29,600
We've both seen them before,
and let's keep rolling.

813
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,200
That's what A.K. is all about.

814
01:14:31,400 --> 01:14:34,800
- I was telling them that we were
gonna bump up and do another one.
- Yeah, perfect.

815
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:37,400
Yeah.

816
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:55,600
So much of snowboarding is...

817
01:14:55,800 --> 01:14:59,600
all you have is what nature gives you
as far as features.

818
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:02,400
Like, 90% of what we do
is exploration,

819
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:06,200
trying to find, you know,
the perfect feature.

820
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:13,800
Some of the progression, I think, too,
is, like, how good are you to play?

821
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:17,000
Travis is a really good example.
He can play with any kind of terrain.

822
01:15:17,000 --> 01:15:20,600
That's what makes him such
a well-rounded snowboarder.

823
01:15:47,200 --> 01:15:50,800
If you were to just, you know, say,
"Hey, let's just jump onto the corners,"

824
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,000
everything would've been okay yesterday.

825
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:55,000
When?
Yesterday.

826
01:15:55,200 --> 01:15:59,000
Well, you went first, dude.
I was waiting for you to do that
so I could follow your lead.

827
01:15:59,000 --> 01:16:01,000
And you just jumped the whole thing.

828
01:16:01,200 --> 01:16:04,600
It was a relief to know I was just
gonna make some turns.

829
01:16:04,600 --> 01:16:07,000
They were like, "Okay, we're gonna
go take a couple runs."

830
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:11,000
And I was, like, "Whew!"
You know, no big jumps today.
Scores!

831
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:49,000
She's really not afraid, you know.
She throws down, and she's strong.

832
01:16:49,200 --> 01:16:53,000
And it's just a matter ofher
getting a little experience
on this type of terrain.

833
01:16:53,200 --> 01:16:56,200
But she's a superstrong rider.

834
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,600
Shaun White and I
are kind of like classmates,

835
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:23,000
and then, like, Farmer and Nick
are kind of the teacher.

836
01:17:23,200 --> 01:17:26,600
You know, we're in their class.
And I didn't expect that coming up here.

837
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:30,800
I thought I'd just be hanging out
with a bunch of dudes.

838
01:17:35,400 --> 01:17:39,000
A trip to Alaska is special for me.

839
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:43,400
And what I expect, you know,
is just to get the best runs of my life.

840
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:47,800
The runs I did here 10 years ago -
like, I still remember those runs.

841
01:17:56,000 --> 01:18:00,600
Sometimes you just pick a line
that was maybe over your head
or not what you expected.

842
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:05,400
You kind of got to
pick lines like that if you want to be
in the limelight of snowboarding.

843
01:18:05,400 --> 01:18:07,400
And that's about pushing limits...

844
01:18:07,400 --> 01:18:11,600
and trying to avoid, you know,
an uncomfortable situation.

845
01:18:27,800 --> 01:18:30,400
Okay, there's no going back now,
that's for sure.

846
01:18:30,400 --> 01:18:32,800
Be actually hard
to unstrap my bindings...

847
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:36,400
where it's jammed
in the little snow coulier.

848
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:40,800
It was definitely a lot of rush
going through my head and my body,

849
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:43,800
and I was, like,
breathing pretty heavy, I'm sure.

850
01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,400
You want to put yourself
in a situation like that,

851
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:09,200
but also, again, not to be
in a situation like that.

852
01:19:09,200 --> 01:19:11,200
It's that fine line again.

853
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:15,400
Getting the chance to come up
and shred with Terje is, like...

854
01:19:15,400 --> 01:19:17,400
you know, I couldn't ask
for anything more.

855
01:19:17,400 --> 01:19:19,800
It's ideal.

856
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:30,000
I'm, uh, really glad I got
to grow up in Norway.

857
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,400
I think it's a beautiful country
and a good country.

858
01:19:35,600 --> 01:19:38,200
Coming from someplace where,
you know, as soon as you're born,

859
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:41,800
you're throwing on a pair of skis
and pushed out onto the snow-

860
01:19:41,800 --> 01:19:44,600
It's something that developed
really naturally for him.

861
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,400
Terje is really...
I mean, he's revered there.

862
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:49,200
He's a real icon.

863
01:19:49,200 --> 01:19:52,600
Terje was the first guy
to break the barrier...

864
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:55,000
and turn into, like, the full-blown
snowboard rock star.

865
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:00,000
Terje Haakonsen became
a household name.

866
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,400
And for a name like Terje to fall off the lips
of some people in middle America,

867
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,800
that's saying something, for sure.

868
01:20:05,800 --> 01:20:10,400
The platform that he's built
for himself, to see him take it
and to start a contest like this...

869
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:13,000
and to see him try to make
a difference with it...

870
01:20:13,200 --> 01:20:16,000
makes the event that much
more enjoyable to experience.

871
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,200
Listen up, guys.

872
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:21,000
It's funny 'cause Terje
was always a guy that sat back...

873
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:25,200
and kind of reacted
to the powers that be.

874
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:28,000
For him to be in that position
is definitely a change.

875
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:32,000
I like to have the control of what's
going on for us riders, you know.

876
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:34,000
I'm still riding in it.

877
01:20:34,200 --> 01:20:37,400
He's had this vision
for where the sport should go.

878
01:20:37,400 --> 01:20:40,000
A lot of younger riders probably
aren't aware of the fact
that it was that event...

879
01:20:40,200 --> 01:20:42,200
and Terje making that event happen...

880
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:44,200
that brought this scale...

881
01:20:44,200 --> 01:20:48,400
of snowboarding features
and snowboarding competitions
to that level.

882
01:20:48,600 --> 01:20:51,800
That's what Terje likes.
He's really, like, pushing
quarter-pipe riding,

883
01:20:52,000 --> 01:20:55,400
and he has to pretty much
almost the limit and beyond.

884
01:21:08,000 --> 01:21:10,400
Andy Finch!

885
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,200
Oh, my God!

886
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:19,600
I wish there was more quarters like this
'cause it's so much damn fun.

887
01:22:19,800 --> 01:22:22,400
Glad to be walking away.
Congratulations.

888
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,000
Thanks.
I'm super stoked that we got,
finally, to ride, you know.

889
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:28,800
Well, I'm looking really
to the surfg part.

890
01:22:33,400 --> 01:22:36,200
The plan is to, you know, fly in,
hold all the events...

891
01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:40,000
and then get on the boat and go out
to this island and enjoy some surfing.

892
01:22:48,800 --> 01:22:51,800
When we had to announce
that we didn't have a half-pipe contest,

893
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:54,000
it was just, like, "Yeah. Cool."

894
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:58,600
It's not that important for them,
you know, to compete all the time.

895
01:22:58,600 --> 01:23:00,800
I think we get more stoked
riding that way.

896
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:26,400
I really enjoy that sport.

897
01:23:27,800 --> 01:23:32,400
It's great to me.
I wish I could do that in every contest.
I want to just go for surf.

898
01:23:50,000 --> 01:23:52,600
Because of its rapid rise in popularity,

899
01:23:52,600 --> 01:23:55,400
the Olympics soon set it sights
on snowboarding.

900
01:23:55,600 --> 01:24:00,600
In 1998 snowboarding reluctantly
stepped on to the Olympic stage,

901
01:24:00,600 --> 01:24:04,200
dividing the tight-knit
snowboarding community.

902
01:24:04,200 --> 01:24:09,000
Coming up to the Olympics,
there was all this hype about how Terje
wasn't gonna be there.

903
01:24:09,200 --> 01:24:11,600
And at that point,
Terje was pretty much considered...

904
01:24:11,800 --> 01:24:14,000
the best half-pipe rider
and the person to beat.

905
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:18,200
And ifhe wasn't there,
it wasn't a real contest.
And I totally agreed with that.

906
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:21,200
I think it's really wrong
and not really good for the sport.

907
01:24:21,400 --> 01:24:24,400
They're trying to pick countries
that are up against countries.

908
01:24:24,600 --> 01:24:26,400
It's not so much
what snowboarding's about.

909
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:29,200
It was important that he was there
to make that decision...

910
01:24:29,400 --> 01:24:33,400
because there was both sides of it,
and he represented that side of it.

911
01:24:33,400 --> 01:24:36,000
As the Olympic team going into Nagano,

912
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:39,800
we had a lot of faith in people
that weren't up to the task...

913
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:43,400
of making snowboarding
look really cool to the world.

914
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:47,200
The athlete Rebagliati, Ross,
member of the Canadian delegation,

915
01:24:47,200 --> 01:24:51,200
is disqualified and excluded
from the 1 8th Olympic Winter Games.

916
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:56,200
It was unfortunate, you know,
to have the whole scandal...

917
01:24:56,400 --> 01:24:59,400
with Ross testing positive
for marijuana.

918
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:03,600
They wanted to strip his medal, and then
they finally allowed him to have it...

919
01:25:03,800 --> 01:25:05,800
Because that wasn't one
of the banned substances.

920
01:25:05,800 --> 01:25:07,800
So because that whole thing happened,

921
01:25:07,800 --> 01:25:11,200
they cut 80% of the coverage
of snowboarding...

922
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:13,000
to the American public.

923
01:25:13,200 --> 01:25:15,400
If anything,
he should get a bonus medal...

924
01:25:15,400 --> 01:25:18,600
for actually being able to get
a gold medal while stoned.

925
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:24,800
We just felt like
they needed us to get over with,
get on the plane and get home.

926
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:26,800
It sucked.

927
01:25:26,800 --> 01:25:30,400
I'd say that's a good kick-off
for the Olympics for snowboarding.

928
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:32,600
I wouldn't choose
to have it any other way.

929
01:25:40,600 --> 01:25:43,000
Four years later
the Salt Lake City games...

930
01:25:43,200 --> 01:25:46,400
would show snowboarding
in a much different light...

931
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:49,600
and forever change the mainstream's
perception of the sport.

932
01:25:51,200 --> 01:25:55,000
Kelly Clark won the first gold
for the United States
during that Olympics,

933
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:57,200
and that was a huge deal.

934
01:25:57,400 --> 01:25:59,600
It really got the attention
of the American public.

935
01:25:59,800 --> 01:26:02,600
They actually gave it
the coverage that it deserved,

936
01:26:02,600 --> 01:26:05,600
and America finally got to see
snowboarding competition,

937
01:26:05,600 --> 01:26:07,600
how it could be.

938
01:26:07,600 --> 01:26:09,600
People freaked out.

939
01:26:09,600 --> 01:26:14,200
Forty-seven years
after the last time the Americans
swept anything in the Olympics,

940
01:26:14,200 --> 01:26:17,800
we get the U.S. snowboard team
come in, and they do it.

941
01:26:18,000 --> 01:26:20,400
And they were the perfect package.

942
01:26:20,400 --> 01:26:22,200
You had the pretty boy, J.J. Thomas.

943
01:26:22,200 --> 01:26:24,400
You had the consummate
professional, Ross Powers,

944
01:26:24,600 --> 01:26:26,200
and the dirtbag, Danny Kass.

945
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:29,200
I think it was, like, kind of like
a morale booster for the States.

946
01:26:29,400 --> 01:26:32,000
I was just more pumped
that my family was there.
A lot of them came out.

947
01:26:32,200 --> 01:26:34,600
So that's where the pride
really kicked in.

948
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:38,800
It was, like, made my mom proud.
I think she cried. It was awesome.

949
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:42,400
Oh, God. Cut!

950
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:45,200
With the guys in 2002,

951
01:26:45,200 --> 01:26:47,200
all of a sudden
snowboarders are our heroes.

952
01:26:47,400 --> 01:26:52,000
And they're hopeful for getting
more gold medals at the Olympics
for years to come.

953
01:27:12,600 --> 01:27:16,000
It's kind of turned down the volume
on my program a little bit.

954
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,600
The conditions are tough,
and I jacked myself a little bit.

955
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,800
When you throw down and kill one,
a really sweet line,

956
01:27:22,800 --> 01:27:24,600
it's an awesome feeling, you know.

957
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:28,000
I can still get down some stuff
and throw down a decent line, I think.

958
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:30,800
Yeah! Farm!

959
01:27:30,800 --> 01:27:34,400
Every day I've gone up, it's just been
some weird new experience.

960
01:27:34,600 --> 01:27:38,400
And this is the only place
I've really felt out of control.

961
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:43,000
I haven't felt like I was on top of my game,
like I could do anything.

962
01:27:43,200 --> 01:27:45,000
It's tough when you feel like that,

963
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:48,400
especially after so many years of me
just feeling like I could do anything.

964
01:27:48,600 --> 01:27:52,200
And I don't know... It just kind of
changed my whole perspective
on everything.

965
01:27:58,200 --> 01:28:01,200
Hopefully this is, you know,
the culmination of it all.

966
01:28:01,200 --> 01:28:05,600
And this fire can chase
the demons out of everybody...

967
01:28:05,600 --> 01:28:07,600
and whatever they have left in 'em,

968
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:11,000
as far as looking forward
to our final goal here.

969
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:14,000
'Cause that financial growth
is about to happen

970
01:28:14,200 --> 01:28:17,800
When the world finds out
about this rappin'

971
01:28:18,000 --> 01:28:20,400
Not the money and fame, yo

972
01:28:20,400 --> 01:28:23,200
I don't give a damn
'cause this song remains the same

973
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:25,200
No matter where I am

974
01:28:45,400 --> 01:28:48,400
Thompson Pass area traffc,
Helicopter 814, Echo Hotel lifting.

975
01:28:48,400 --> 01:28:51,000
Tsaina Lodge, westbound.

976
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:53,800
Oh, we like this ride, don't we?

977
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:56,400
Oh, pretty day.
Follow our favorite river.

978
01:29:00,600 --> 01:29:03,600
Well, you know,
as we leave our backyard here,

979
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:06,600
we venture into the Arctic North,

980
01:29:06,600 --> 01:29:09,600
which is kind of the last zone
where nobody's been yet.

981
01:29:09,600 --> 01:29:12,200
That's where the highest
mountains are in this area,

982
01:29:12,400 --> 01:29:14,800
so there's got to be some rad lines
in there someplace.

983
01:29:14,800 --> 01:29:17,600
You know what they say...
There's always a better line
over the next ridge.

984
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:25,600
Pretty much this is all
undiscovered terrain out here now.

985
01:29:25,600 --> 01:29:29,200
It's getting more and more vertical
as we get back here farther.

986
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:37,000
You know, one of things that we're
gonna be running up against, Drew,

987
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:39,200
is finding a zone
that can please everyone.

988
01:29:39,200 --> 01:29:41,400
We don't want to scare anybody
to the point...

989
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:45,600
of wanting to be helicoptered off
the top of the mountain.

990
01:29:47,000 --> 01:29:51,200
There's plenty out here.
It's just a matter of taking our time
and finding the right one.

991
01:29:51,400 --> 01:29:54,600
Let me call back to base, and we'll
get the troops headed this way.

992
01:29:54,600 --> 01:29:56,600
Sounds good.

993
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,200
My last day of riding.
I'm gonna miss it.

994
01:30:17,200 --> 01:30:20,000
This schedule has been so fun-filled,

995
01:30:20,000 --> 01:30:22,800
and I'm going to miss all these guys
so much, you know.

996
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,800
We were just being, like, a nice team.

997
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:45,000
If we can find a base up here somewhere
that looks like it might be workable,

998
01:30:45,000 --> 01:30:47,800
I'll go ahead and try
and set down on the top.

999
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:51,800
And, uh, we'll go with that.
Sounds good.

1000
01:30:54,200 --> 01:30:58,000
7601 - this is one of
the highest peaks out here.

1001
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:01,600
Let's just go see
if we can get in up there.
Okay. The winds are pretty strong today.

1002
01:31:01,600 --> 01:31:04,800
I may have to
make a couple of attempts at it.

1003
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:08,200
This'll be one of the hairier lines,
I can guarantee that.

1004
01:31:31,400 --> 01:31:34,400
Being on the top of that thing,
with the winds blowing, I was scared.

1005
01:31:34,600 --> 01:31:37,000
I didn't think.
I'm, like, "There's no way
we're going down this."

1006
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:41,200
The true fact is, I was scared of it.
I can say, "Oh, I didn't trust
this, this and that."

1007
01:31:41,200 --> 01:31:44,600
But I was scared
to fall down that mountain.

1008
01:31:49,000 --> 01:31:54,000
You know, when I'm scared, I know that
it's not right, for me, at least at that time.

1009
01:31:57,000 --> 01:32:00,800
It was gnarly. It was super gnarly.

1010
01:32:01,000 --> 01:32:03,000
The wind was just hammering so much.

1011
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:06,600
And I didn't even think the helicopter
was going to come back.

1012
01:32:11,200 --> 01:32:15,400
Well, conditions got to be just right
to do a mountain like 7601.

1013
01:32:15,400 --> 01:32:18,400
You know, there's no doubt that there's
plenty of peaks out there to ride,

1014
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:21,000
but we were kind of
coming up short on time,

1015
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:26,000
and we still wanted to get
that one big run in before we all left.

1016
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:34,000
The hardest thing for me is
to actually come down to Earth...

1017
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:37,000
and just be, like,
"Okay, here's something I can't do."

1018
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,400
'Cause I always look-
I want to do the superhero lines.

1019
01:32:39,600 --> 01:32:42,000
How big do you think that was?

1020
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:45,800
Middle cliff band is huge.

1021
01:32:45,800 --> 01:32:47,800
I don't know, dude.
Probably, huh?

1022
01:32:47,800 --> 01:32:51,200
Looks like it's gonna be pow.
I think it's gonna be killer
coming down.

1023
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:54,600
There's a lot of ridge
on the way down.
See all those things?

1024
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,800
So, I think this is us
right here on this cornice.

1025
01:32:59,800 --> 01:33:02,800
If you came in like that,
that would be skier's ride
a little bit...

1026
01:33:02,800 --> 01:33:06,000
to get around the rock bend
and to get out where you can
look at it.

1027
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,400
I learn something every day
when I'm on the mountain.

1028
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:11,000
The one I talk to the most
would probably be Farmer.

1029
01:33:11,200 --> 01:33:15,600
You know, he just puts it in such a way
that it's easy to understand.

1030
01:33:15,600 --> 01:33:20,400
Now, just don't cut.
If there's a huge river of snow
or whatever there, don't get in it.

1031
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:23,400
As long as you stay on that wall,
you'll be all right.

1032
01:33:59,200 --> 01:34:02,600
When it really comes down to it,
you know, it's pretty much
the best thing ever.

1033
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:05,600
It's way better than competition.
I know that, you know.

1034
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:08,400
Or, like, you don't expect
anything of yourself.

1035
01:34:08,600 --> 01:34:12,000
You know, "I'm just gonna go out
and make a few turns today."

1036
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:19,600
You know, she had a special sparkle
in her eye for this place. She did.

1037
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:23,000
She got confdent. She knows
that there's no limits up here.

1038
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:29,400
I just respect somebody that charges,

1039
01:34:29,600 --> 01:34:33,200
that is not afraid...
apprehensive, but not afraid...

1040
01:34:33,200 --> 01:34:36,200
to actually bust out
when the time comes.

1041
01:34:48,600 --> 01:34:51,600
It's got a little pow,
but it's decent snow.
It'll be safe.

1042
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:57,800
I talked to Farm, and he said,
"Slow down. Just take it under control."

1043
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:01,000
And I went out there,
and I just took my normal speed...

1044
01:35:01,000 --> 01:35:04,000
and just pulled it back just a notch.

1045
01:35:14,600 --> 01:35:18,200
Yeah! Yeah!
That's killer.

1046
01:35:33,400 --> 01:35:36,600
I found more cliffs.
I found more little things to jump.

1047
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:38,800
I found the line
I wanted to do way easier...

1048
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:41,600
than if I was just blazing
through there.

1049
01:35:58,600 --> 01:36:01,400
It's been kind of a revelation for me.

1050
01:36:04,400 --> 01:36:07,200
Right now, I'm not in a lot of pain,
but, man, in the morning,

1051
01:36:07,200 --> 01:36:10,000
I swear to God, for the first
three or four hours, man,

1052
01:36:10,200 --> 01:36:12,200
I can't raise my head off the pillow.

1053
01:36:12,200 --> 01:36:15,600
So, I'm jacked pretty good,
but it's nothing permanent.

1054
01:36:15,800 --> 01:36:19,000
I'm glad it wasn't serious,
but I'm cool with it.

1055
01:36:40,600 --> 01:36:45,400
His line is sketchy.
I honestly don't think he knows where
he's gonna go until he's in it.

1056
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:50,400
There's this huge open powder face
or there's this sketchy, rocky gorge.

1057
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:52,200
He's all, "Hmm, I'll take the gorge."

1058
01:36:58,800 --> 01:37:03,400
I had one good line in this whole trip.
One good line.

1059
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:12,600
Oh, man, by the time we'd finished,
you know, the wind had died down,

1060
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:15,600
and Terje wanted to go back
and have a look at 7601.

1061
01:37:15,600 --> 01:37:19,400
You know,
he had that mountain on his mind
the whole time, I could tell.

1062
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:25,400
Yeah, Terje's gonna have a real good look
at 7601 and probably ride it.

1063
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:30,400
So, we would like the second group
to come out right now
and come over to "F" top.

1064
01:37:30,400 --> 01:37:33,600
Copy that. Second group
coming out to "F" top.

1065
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:36,400
Yeah, Terje, that looks sick.

1066
01:37:36,400 --> 01:37:39,400
Terje's, like, "I'm going back
to that one. I'm doing it."

1067
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,600
Me and Farm are, like, "What?"

1068
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:49,800
The conditions were right.
There was a big line.

1069
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:54,800
Just got to jump on it when you can.
Definitely needed a long run
before I could leave Alaska.

1070
01:37:55,000 --> 01:37:57,800
When nobody's ever done something,
and it's a descent...

1071
01:37:58,000 --> 01:38:02,400
or you don't know whether it's gonna
avalanche or not, it's really sketchy.

1072
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:06,400
If you mess up, it's, like,
big consequences, you know.

1073
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:12,600
Whenever you're doing the grand finale,
the biggest peak or the gnarliest line,

1074
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:14,800
you have to have mental toughness.

1075
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:18,800
And one of the mental toughest
snowboarders I know is Terje.

1076
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:25,600
Terje Haakonsen's on top
of that peak right there.
It's called 7601.

1077
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:28,200
I think that's how high it is - 7,000.

1078
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:31,400
It's gonna be a first descent.

1079
01:38:31,600 --> 01:38:33,600
It's really gnarly up there.

1080
01:38:33,600 --> 01:38:37,000
I mean,
it's looking 60 degrees at the top
just to get on the chute.

1081
01:38:41,400 --> 01:38:44,200
I know he was gripped.
You have to be gripped on top of that.

1082
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:48,400
Five, four, three,
He's gonna rip it, man.
He's a good snowboarder.

1083
01:38:48,400 --> 01:38:51,000
Two, one!

1084
01:39:42,200 --> 01:39:44,200
Oh, my God! He's hauling ass!

1085
01:39:50,200 --> 01:39:53,400
He's totally raging
down the face right now.

1086
01:39:53,400 --> 01:39:57,000
- Damn!
- Hard.

1087
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,800
Gnarly. Absolutely amazing.

1088
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:34,000
Killing it.
You know, I was so impressed.

1089
01:40:35,800 --> 01:40:39,800
When you overcome that doubt and fear
at the same time and you pull it,

1090
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:42,600
you're just, like, jacked, man.

1091
01:40:42,800 --> 01:40:44,600
Jacked for sure.

1092
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:47,400
It was awesome.
It was awesome to witness.

1093
01:40:47,600 --> 01:40:51,000
I feel privileged just to even see that.
It's history. Truly history.

1094
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:54,200
It gives you a great rush, that's for sure.

1095
01:40:54,400 --> 01:40:58,200
And a lot ofbutterflies,
you know, a couple hours later.

1096
01:40:58,400 --> 01:41:01,800
You know, I could've packed up
and called it a day.

1097
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:05,000
Think I did, actually.

1098
01:41:05,000 --> 01:41:08,000
He overcame all his fears,

1099
01:41:08,200 --> 01:41:12,400
which is the hardest thing
for a human being to do.

1100
01:41:12,600 --> 01:41:14,800
It's tough, man. I can't do it.

1101
01:41:16,600 --> 01:41:19,800
Terje can. Farm can.
Sometimes.

1102
01:41:20,000 --> 01:41:22,600
Sometimes.
Once in a while.

1103
01:41:31,400 --> 01:41:37,000
Coming up here
and, like, looking for first ascents
and clay mountains...

1104
01:41:37,200 --> 01:41:40,000
the name's on them-
you know, it's not important.

1105
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:42,800
The thing to do -
I think, it's more just...

1106
01:41:43,000 --> 01:41:45,400
You have to satisfy yourself,

1107
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:48,000
doing what you like to accomplish.

1108
01:41:48,200 --> 01:41:51,000
You know, I got it all in this trip.

1109
01:41:51,000 --> 01:41:53,000
I'm stoked with it.

1110
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:55,200
I can live with it.

1111
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:05,400
He's, like, probably one of the most
amazing snowboarders I've ever met.

1112
01:42:07,000 --> 01:42:11,800
He's so fluid,
and he's a true master of his sport.

1113
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:16,400
And I don't think there's anything that
that guy can't do on a snowboard.

1114
01:42:20,200 --> 01:42:24,400
That was killer, man.
Sick.

1115
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:28,600
You won't forget that one
for a while.
Yup.

1116
01:42:28,600 --> 01:42:32,800
This place enlightens you.

1117
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:36,600
You know, it puts you in a good mood.
It... it humbles you.

1118
01:42:36,600 --> 01:42:39,400
It hits you with so many
different emotions...

1119
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:41,800
just sitting right here,
looking out there...

1120
01:42:42,000 --> 01:42:45,200
that you can't help leave here...

1121
01:42:45,400 --> 01:42:47,600
and not be a bigger and better person.

1122
01:42:47,600 --> 01:42:51,000
That's what this place does to you.
It makes you strong.

1123
01:42:53,000 --> 01:42:56,200
Alaska's really touched my heart
in an amazing way,

1124
01:42:56,400 --> 01:43:00,200
and it's influenced me so much
that, yeah, I'm gonna come back.

1125
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:03,400
Just 'cause I've had so much fun
and found so much joy here
and learned so much.

1126
01:43:03,400 --> 01:43:05,800
You know, how could I not come back?

1127
01:43:05,800 --> 01:43:09,400
I feel like, you know,

1128
01:43:09,400 --> 01:43:12,600
if I was a warrior,
I would've got... I got a badge here.

1129
01:43:18,400 --> 01:43:20,400
I have such mixed feelings
while I'm out here.

1130
01:43:20,400 --> 01:43:22,800
I think this place is amazing,

1131
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:27,400
but, for me, I just think I need to focus
a bit more on some other stuff...

1132
01:43:27,400 --> 01:43:29,400
before I come back here.

1133
01:43:29,400 --> 01:43:33,800
It's just opening up this whole new book
when I haven't even closed this other one.

1134
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:36,000
I still have some more chapters to fill.

1135
01:43:37,400 --> 01:43:41,800
Just being in the Alaskan mountain,
it's like a competition itself, you know,
but for yourself.

1136
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:44,600
Taking that next step
to the backcountry free riding.

1137
01:43:44,800 --> 01:43:46,800
This is what snowboarding's all about.

1138
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:54,400
Every time I think I don't care anymore,
you know, I go out and I do it,
and I have, like, the best time.

1139
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:57,800
In fact, that's almost the best time...

1140
01:43:58,000 --> 01:44:00,600
is when you just lay it down for a while
and then pick it back up.

1141
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:03,600
I'll do it for as long as I can,
which is probably forever.

1142
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:19,200
For snowboarding, the diverse culture
and free-thinking attitude...

1143
01:44:19,200 --> 01:44:21,200
that has been there
from the beginning...

1144
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:23,200
will always shape the sport.

1145
01:44:23,400 --> 01:44:26,600
And the future
will be determined by the riders...

1146
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:30,000
who will continue to push limits
and change the way mountains are ridden.

1147
01:44:32,000 --> 01:44:35,800
I would say snowboarding's future
has always looked bright.

1148
01:44:36,000 --> 01:44:38,000
What's gonna happen
10 years from now?

1149
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:42,000
What, are they gonna be
getting 40 feet out of the pipe
or 10 rotations in the air?

1150
01:44:42,000 --> 01:44:46,200
Nobody can tell you where
snowboarding's going to be in 10 years
or what riders are gonna be doing,

1151
01:44:46,200 --> 01:44:48,000
but, for sure, it's gonna progress.

1152
01:44:53,200 --> 01:44:57,200
It's changed in size.
People go way bigger now
'cause the jumps are bigger.

1153
01:44:57,400 --> 01:45:00,000
People go fatter in the pipe
'cause the pipe's fatter, you know.

1154
01:45:00,200 --> 01:45:03,200
But, really, it all comes down
to visualization...

1155
01:45:03,200 --> 01:45:06,000
and what you can think of
in your mind.

1156
01:45:09,400 --> 01:45:13,200
I look at a mountain completely different
than a person that might just be
a recreational skier does.

1157
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:16,800
I see the mountain
as a gigantic terrain park.

1158
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:19,600
Everything's rideable,
everything's doable
in some way or another.

1159
01:45:19,800 --> 01:45:23,400
Your mind always got to be working,
and that's how you learn tricks.

1160
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:27,000
That's how you progress the sport.
That's everything. Your mind's gotta be open.

1161
01:45:28,600 --> 01:45:32,400
I think the next level in snowboarding
is starting to happen now.

1162
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:36,200
I mean, all of us have learned
all these freestyle tricks.

1163
01:45:36,200 --> 01:45:40,400
So, we're all starting to take that
into the backcountry where
the elements are unpredictable,

1164
01:45:40,400 --> 01:45:44,800
and you can't necessarily see over
the next thing where you're gonna land.

1165
01:45:46,200 --> 01:45:48,400
Freestyle in the backcountry...

1166
01:45:48,600 --> 01:45:52,600
is the ultimate part
of snowboarding for me.

1167
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:55,800
And I'd tell anybody, you know,
if you haven't done that, then go do it.

1168
01:45:55,800 --> 01:45:58,800
Or be careful
because you will get hooked.

1169
01:46:01,000 --> 01:46:04,600
It's something that I want to do
till I can't do it anymore.

1170
01:46:07,200 --> 01:46:11,600
It's kind of comforting to know
that something that was such a struggle
is so easy now.

1171
01:46:11,600 --> 01:46:14,800
It was a hell of a ride.

1172
01:46:14,800 --> 01:46:16,800
It started for the all the right reasons,

1173
01:46:17,000 --> 01:46:21,200
and it started with a group of people
that were so 'core and so in love,

1174
01:46:21,200 --> 01:46:23,200
so passionate about snowboarding,

1175
01:46:23,400 --> 01:46:25,800
that nobody will ever be able
to take that away.
