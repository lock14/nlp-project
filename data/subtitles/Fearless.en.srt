00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:28,779
I.O.C. Event Presentation Shanghai, China

2
00:00:41,625 --> 00:00:44,169
wushu, the Chinese form of martial art,

3
00:00:44,378 --> 00:00:46,380
should be an Olympic event.

4
00:00:46,755 --> 00:00:48,757
It isn't about killing and vengeance,

5
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,509
hatred and anger.

6
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:51,844
Then what is wushu?

7
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:55,556
In Chinese, wushu means
"The way of Combat."

8
00:00:58,433 --> 00:01:00,936
Avert. Conflict.

9
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:05,691
The true definition of wushu
is the way to avert conflict.

10
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,109
It's about continually

11
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:08,735
seeking to better oneself.

12
00:01:08,944 --> 00:01:11,238
Still, it begs the question, why?

13
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:14,074
Why allow wushu as
an Olympic event?

14
00:01:14,533 --> 00:01:17,494
The Olympic Creed streses
that the most important thing

15
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:19,496
is not to win, but to take part.

16
00:01:19,705 --> 00:01:22,165
Just as the most important thing in life
is not the triumph

17
00:01:22,374 --> 00:01:23,167
but the struggle.

18
00:01:23,375 --> 00:01:27,588
You believe this ideal
embodies the spirit of wushu?

19
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:33,427
Yes. The answer lies over
one hundred years in the past...

20
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,095
beginning with one man...

21
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:44,284
Come here.

22
00:01:56,241 --> 00:02:00,037
Get off if you have no money.

23
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,759
Set off.

24
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:30,335
3o years ago, Huo Clan, Tianjin

25
00:04:57,756 --> 00:05:00,634
Young master, we must leave!

26
00:05:19,945 --> 00:05:20,904
Stop!

27
00:05:22,948 --> 00:05:24,074
How dare you!

28
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:25,894
Who gave you permision to come in?

29
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:28,036
I was bringing you tea.

30
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:30,873
How many times have I said,
you are not allowed in here!

31
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:36,253
Go practice your calligraphy!

32
00:05:43,427 --> 00:05:44,261
Go on!

33
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,283
I do your homework everyday.

34
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,785
You'd be in trouble, if your father knew.

35
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:16,919
Don't say anything and no one will know.

36
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:19,254
I want to show you something.

37
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:29,014
Jinsun! Come on!

38
00:06:29,473 --> 00:06:31,058
I'm coming!

39
00:06:33,018 --> 00:06:34,770
- Come on!
- I'm coming!

40
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:40,817
I'm coming!

41
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:55,123
Why do you take me here?

42
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:56,812
No one of other clan is allowed here.

43
00:06:56,959 --> 00:06:58,377
Don't wory, I'm here.

44
00:06:59,795 --> 00:07:00,587
Follow me

45
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:06,510
Declaration of Life and Death.

46
00:07:06,718 --> 00:07:09,847
Every time my dad wins,
he gets one of these.

47
00:07:10,055 --> 00:07:12,224
You see how many dad has won!

48
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:15,686
But your dad is not number one in Tianjin.

49
00:07:15,894 --> 00:07:18,021
My father will be tomorow.

50
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:18,814
Why?

51
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:21,316
Don't ask. You come with me tomorow

52
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,244
Today's match is between...

53
00:07:33,078 --> 00:07:36,665
Huo Engdi of the Huo Clan...

54
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:39,835
and Zhao Zhongqiang...

55
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:44,006
of the Zhao Clan.

56
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:53,891
Why are you two here? Looking for trouble?

57
00:07:54,099 --> 00:07:55,601
Your father will lose today.

58
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,353
Our Huo wushu will beat your Zhao wushu.

59
00:07:58,562 --> 00:07:59,605
You wait and see.

60
00:08:00,564 --> 00:08:02,900
My dad will let your dad
have a taste of Zhao's blow.

61
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:05,569
The Death waiver has been signed.

62
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,447
Win or lose, it's up to you.

63
00:08:09,031 --> 00:08:10,908
Live or die, it's up to god.

64
00:08:11,575 --> 00:08:15,746
Gentlemen, let the contest... begin!

65
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:40,812
Zhaojian, now your father has tasted...

66
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,648
the Huo wushu!

67
00:09:15,389 --> 00:09:17,224
The winner is...

68
00:09:17,474 --> 00:09:21,395
- Zhao Zhongqiang!
- Thank you!

69
00:09:31,071 --> 00:09:34,491
Yuanjia...

70
00:09:35,576 --> 00:09:36,256
Yuanjia...

71
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,634
Yuanjia, let's go home.

72
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,389
Yuanjia, let's go home.

73
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:00,017
Look who's here?

74
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,471
Has the cat got your tongue?

75
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:04,146
Act llike a man. Don't be a wus.

76
00:10:04,438 --> 00:10:05,355
Get up!

77
00:10:05,564 --> 00:10:07,065
Zhao, you've gone too far!

78
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,609
You shut up!

79
00:10:09,902 --> 00:10:13,113
You're worthles.
Your Huo wushu is more worthles.

80
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:14,823
Fight me if you dare.

81
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:17,326
Then you'll know the Zhao wushu...

82
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:22,122
Get up there!

83
00:10:37,971 --> 00:10:39,389
Yuanjia, stop!

84
00:10:43,143 --> 00:10:44,061
Stop!

85
00:10:57,574 --> 00:10:59,826
Now that you've tasted my wushu

86
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:02,079
you can shut up about yours.

87
00:11:02,496 --> 00:11:05,666
I won, I won!

88
00:11:06,917 --> 00:11:09,086
Yuanjia. Get up, Yuanjia.

89
00:11:13,465 --> 00:11:14,705
Yuanjia, let's get out of here.

90
00:11:16,134 --> 00:11:17,094
I, Huo Yuanjia...

91
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:20,556
swear never to be...
defeated again!

92
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,935
Jinsun, if you are my friend,
please help me.

93
00:11:27,354 --> 00:11:29,273
Hury up, hury!

94
00:11:33,902 --> 00:11:35,503
How much longer it is going to take you?

95
00:11:39,449 --> 00:11:40,117
Look!

96
00:11:46,248 --> 00:11:46,957
Get out of here!

97
00:11:47,249 --> 00:11:48,170
Please help me copy it.

98
00:11:48,292 --> 00:11:49,376
Let's go.

99
00:11:50,377 --> 00:11:52,546
Oh, yes, you copy it here

100
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:54,047
and take the copy home when you finish.

101
00:11:54,256 --> 00:11:57,885
My dad will beat
me if he sees it.

102
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,098
- Come back as soon as you can!
- I will!

103
00:12:04,808 --> 00:12:06,528
Be very careful when you copy the last page

104
00:12:06,602 --> 00:12:08,812
on the Exterminating Blow, would you?

105
00:12:13,317 --> 00:12:15,360
Young master,
why are you in the master's library?

106
00:12:16,153 --> 00:12:17,654
Are you beaten?

107
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:21,325
Hury, the master wants you. Come on.

108
00:12:21,867 --> 00:12:23,285
Are you ok?

109
00:12:31,168 --> 00:12:31,960
Kneel down!

110
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:37,382
You are fighting again!

111
00:12:38,509 --> 00:12:41,929
I ask you to study,
but all you do is make trouble outside.

112
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:43,805
Laifu,

113
00:12:45,015 --> 00:12:47,351
- bring the rod!
- Yes.

114
00:12:53,315 --> 00:12:57,903
Look how he is bruised.
There is no rush to punish him.

115
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,031
Master.

116
00:13:03,617 --> 00:13:04,743
- Laifu,
- Yes, Madam.

117
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:06,513
Take the young master back to his room.

118
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:10,666
Copy Confucius' The Analects ten times
and give it to me before dinner.

119
00:13:10,999 --> 00:13:12,668
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

120
00:13:20,384 --> 00:13:23,554
Let me put some medicine on it.

121
00:13:25,222 --> 00:13:27,683
Lai. You may leave.

122
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:29,101
Yes.

123
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:38,861
Why are you upset?

124
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:41,154
Mother, why doesn't father teach me wushu?

125
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,867
Because he cares about you.

126
00:13:45,576 --> 00:13:47,077
You have lasthma.

127
00:13:47,244 --> 00:13:49,621
The training is too much for you.

128
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,207
But it can make me strong.

129
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:57,296
You want to learn just to be strong?

130
00:13:58,130 --> 00:13:59,731
When I'm good enough, I'll take revenge.

131
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:02,426
I want Zhao to fear our Huo wushu.

132
00:14:08,599 --> 00:14:09,600
My child,

133
00:14:10,517 --> 00:14:14,229
wu Shu is not about winning.

134
00:14:14,605 --> 00:14:17,149
It's about discipline and self-restraint.

135
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:21,445
One practices wushu...

136
00:14:22,196 --> 00:14:26,033
for... inner strength...

137
00:14:26,408 --> 00:14:30,078
and to help... the weak.

138
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,540
Wushu...

139
00:14:33,957 --> 00:14:37,336
is not for revenge.

140
00:14:37,628 --> 00:14:39,755
Respect must be earned.

141
00:14:39,963 --> 00:14:42,174
If I'm really good, everyone will fear me.

142
00:14:43,592 --> 00:14:44,593
Fear and respect...

143
00:14:44,885 --> 00:14:47,596
are not the same.

144
00:14:49,556 --> 00:14:52,434
Now do your penance.

145
00:14:52,726 --> 00:14:54,645
Don't make your father angry.

146
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:14,605
Have you finished your calligraphy?

147
00:15:14,706 --> 00:15:15,749
Soon.

148
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:18,210
- How come you do it so slow?
- Don't bother.

149
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:19,378
I'm not going to do it
if you keep bothering me.

150
00:15:19,586 --> 00:15:22,214
Ok, I'm going to bother you. Hury up.

151
00:16:10,971 --> 00:16:11,889
You dare to sign?

152
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,683
Thank you for preparing all this.

153
00:16:14,975 --> 00:16:16,393
This is also what I want to do.

154
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,436
After you, sir!

155
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:38,415
You win...

156
00:16:40,626 --> 00:16:41,293
Now you have your revenge

157
00:16:41,502 --> 00:16:43,504
and can study well, right?

158
00:16:49,510 --> 00:16:50,802
Your Zhao's kung fu is nothing
but bungling oafishnes.

159
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:53,931
Today you have a taste
of our Huo's kung fu.

160
00:16:54,139 --> 00:16:56,892
Remember,
never brag about Zhao's kung fu again.

161
00:16:59,311 --> 00:17:00,521
Let me help you, Zhaojian.

162
00:17:00,729 --> 00:17:01,813
Get away!

163
00:17:02,022 --> 00:17:02,522
I won!

164
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,665
I won!

165
00:17:19,957 --> 00:17:21,750
Fly... fly... fly...

166
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:25,587
- You're falling down, falling...
- I'm not falling.

167
00:17:25,921 --> 00:17:29,258
- You're falling down, falling...
- I'm not falling.

168
00:17:29,466 --> 00:17:30,968
Then father knocks you down...

169
00:17:32,636 --> 00:17:37,432
I'm not falling down.

170
00:17:46,483 --> 00:17:47,693
Be careful with her.

171
00:17:52,531 --> 00:17:53,490
Good morning, Mother.

172
00:17:55,450 --> 00:17:58,745
You didn't take your medicine again.

173
00:17:59,163 --> 00:18:01,874
Mother, since I began training,

174
00:18:02,082 --> 00:18:03,834
my lasthma has gone.

175
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:07,754
Look at your daughter.

176
00:18:08,005 --> 00:18:11,216
You've spoiled her since her mother died.

177
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:14,011
Your daughter needs a mother.

178
00:18:14,178 --> 00:18:16,805
You should mary again.

179
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:22,144
Mother, I'm too busy building up
the family reputation.

180
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:25,189
Soon everyone in Tianjin
will respect the Huo name.

181
00:18:25,814 --> 00:18:27,357
There's no time for mariage.

182
00:18:28,984 --> 00:18:30,402
Father, I want to go see you fight.

183
00:18:30,611 --> 00:18:33,989
All these years, you haven't lost.

184
00:18:34,823 --> 00:18:37,576
Your most formidable enemy...

185
00:18:38,327 --> 00:18:40,162
lies...

186
00:18:40,537 --> 00:18:42,664
within you.

187
00:18:43,248 --> 00:18:44,541
Oh, I get it.

188
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:51,882
Young master...

189
00:18:53,509 --> 00:18:54,718
Oh, yes.

190
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:59,681
Mother, why not go take a rest?

191
00:19:05,979 --> 00:19:06,813
Father,

192
00:19:07,397 --> 00:19:09,358
your fist wasn't fast enough...

193
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:11,235
and your heart wasn't hard enough.

194
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:13,695
Rest asured, as long as I live,

195
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:17,115
the Huo family will never lose again.

196
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,257
I'll be the Champion of Tianjin.

197
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,466
Father!

198
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:37,010
Jade!

199
00:19:40,305 --> 00:19:41,807
- For me?
- No.

200
00:19:42,057 --> 00:19:44,685
- Please!
- No.

201
00:19:45,227 --> 00:19:46,520
When do I get it?

202
00:19:46,895 --> 00:19:49,147
When you win.

203
00:19:49,481 --> 00:19:50,774
- Really!
- Yes.

204
00:19:51,149 --> 00:19:52,234
Promise?

205
00:19:55,779 --> 00:19:58,782
Tianjin, 1900

206
00:20:06,248 --> 00:20:07,749
Master, you always win.

207
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:14,506
Master Huo.
When you will be the Champion of the world?

208
00:20:15,007 --> 00:20:16,341
I don't know. What do you think?

209
00:20:17,009 --> 00:20:19,970
Today! It'll be today!

210
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:42,117
Hi, Zhao!

211
00:20:42,534 --> 00:20:44,254
Where have you been hiding all these years?

212
00:20:44,495 --> 00:20:47,956
I've fought in 38 cities in 17 provinces.

213
00:20:48,332 --> 00:20:49,750
My skills are so good...

214
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,502
that I remain undefeated.

215
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:54,004
Bullshit!

216
00:20:54,213 --> 00:20:55,464
You're bullshit!

217
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:57,966
The Death waiver has been signed.

218
00:20:58,175 --> 00:21:00,886
Let the contest begins!

219
00:21:10,521 --> 00:21:12,147
Come! Come on up!

220
00:21:21,198 --> 00:21:24,451
What's the matter? Scared?

221
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,370
Afraid you'll fall and hurt yourself?

222
00:21:26,578 --> 00:21:27,454
In your dreams!

223
00:21:39,216 --> 00:21:40,676
Great! Master!

224
00:22:46,033 --> 00:22:48,952
I am unyielding llike a mountain.
My legs - the firm bedrock.

225
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:51,121
Today, Huo wushu becomes history.

226
00:22:51,330 --> 00:22:53,540
Fine! You'll have your chance...

227
00:22:53,957 --> 00:22:54,791
to lose!

228
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:28,534
- Cat's paw?
- Tiger's claw!

229
00:23:45,843 --> 00:23:46,635
Give up!

230
00:23:52,099 --> 00:23:53,475
Great!

231
00:23:55,185 --> 00:23:56,385
You think you'd win so easily?

232
00:23:56,687 --> 00:23:58,689
- Cat's paw!
- Tiger's claw!

233
00:24:18,667 --> 00:24:19,626
You've lost!

234
00:24:30,888 --> 00:24:31,972
Be careful!

235
00:24:40,230 --> 00:24:41,356
Master!

236
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:43,692
- Are you OK?
- I'm fine!

237
00:24:44,651 --> 00:24:45,944
So, you're still alive!

238
00:24:49,907 --> 00:24:51,033
- Don't touch me!
- Master!

239
00:24:51,241 --> 00:24:53,660
The winner is... Huo Yuanjia!

240
00:24:56,246 --> 00:24:59,875
Thank you. Thank you.

241
00:25:02,586 --> 00:25:03,712
Thank you. Thank you.

242
00:25:31,281 --> 00:25:32,407
Master,

243
00:25:32,741 --> 00:25:34,201
Thank you.

244
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:37,037
Congratulations!

245
00:25:37,538 --> 00:25:38,664
Thank you.

246
00:25:40,290 --> 00:25:41,583
This way please, Master Huo.

247
00:25:41,792 --> 00:25:43,043
Thank you.

248
00:25:43,252 --> 00:25:45,420
- Yuanjia!
- Hey, Jinsun!

249
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:48,841
You've just arived?

250
00:25:49,341 --> 00:25:50,592
Your usual table is ready.

251
00:25:51,802 --> 00:25:57,933
Congratulations!

252
00:25:58,767 --> 00:26:01,436
Thanks, thanks.

253
00:26:02,396 --> 00:26:03,939
Come on! Drink up!

254
00:26:07,234 --> 00:26:09,194
Jinsun, your restaurant is...

255
00:26:09,653 --> 00:26:11,113
more popular than ever.

256
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,866
Thanks to all my friends, it's getting by.

257
00:26:14,449 --> 00:26:15,576
When we were young...

258
00:26:16,285 --> 00:26:17,744
you were such a nerd!

259
00:26:17,995 --> 00:26:20,330
Who could imagine you'd become
such a great busines man?

260
00:26:20,581 --> 00:26:23,750
No one will pay me to read books all day.

261
00:26:23,959 --> 00:26:24,626
But being a businesman?

262
00:26:24,835 --> 00:26:26,503
It's a living.

263
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:29,631
Yuanjia, you must try these.

264
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:32,843
I've recruited the best chefs...
from acros the country.

265
00:26:33,051 --> 00:26:34,636
Have a taste. Tell me what you think.

266
00:26:34,845 --> 00:26:36,346
Come, come, eat!

267
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:38,974
Master, after you.

268
00:26:44,229 --> 00:26:46,064
- I'm Xia Xiang.
- I'm Xu DaShan.

269
00:26:46,356 --> 00:26:48,817
Please take us as your disciples
we want to learn Huo wushu...

270
00:26:49,026 --> 00:26:50,986
and we'll devote ourselves to you!

271
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,114
Good! You look tough enough.

272
00:26:54,364 --> 00:26:55,324
Give them drinks!

273
00:26:57,618 --> 00:26:59,244
Bottoms up and we'll all be brothers.

274
00:26:59,453 --> 00:27:00,496
Cheers!

275
00:27:01,538 --> 00:27:03,332
Master Huo, congratulations!

276
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,500
Thanks, master.

277
00:27:07,294 --> 00:27:08,378
Today is a joyous occasion.

278
00:27:08,587 --> 00:27:10,589
Everything's on me!

279
00:27:11,924 --> 00:27:12,841
Enjoy!

280
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,801
Have a seat!

281
00:27:15,552 --> 00:27:17,679
Come, come, eat!

282
00:27:21,308 --> 00:27:22,351
Jade!

283
00:27:22,893 --> 00:27:25,896
It's time for bed.

284
00:27:26,063 --> 00:27:28,190
Go tuck her in.

285
00:27:33,237 --> 00:27:35,322
Mis, it's time for bed.

286
00:27:35,531 --> 00:27:37,616
Be a good girl, come on.

287
00:27:37,825 --> 00:27:40,661
It's bed time. Come on...

288
00:27:58,178 --> 00:27:59,555
what's this? It tastes horible!

289
00:27:59,930 --> 00:28:01,306
It's called "Coffee."

290
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:03,851
A western thing. Not used to it, are you?

291
00:28:04,601 --> 00:28:07,187
These are turbulent times.

292
00:28:07,563 --> 00:28:08,897
Our country has grown weak.

293
00:28:09,106 --> 00:28:11,608
The west is dominating us.

294
00:28:12,109 --> 00:28:13,360
People llike me must not...

295
00:28:13,569 --> 00:28:15,028
be concerned only with money.

296
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:16,738
People llike you should not...

297
00:28:17,114 --> 00:28:19,074
be concerned only with fighting.

298
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:20,742
Our country deserves better.

299
00:28:21,410 --> 00:28:24,413
Politics is for intellectuals.

300
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:27,758
I'm just a fighter. To be the Champion
of Tianjin is all I care about.

301
00:28:28,208 --> 00:28:30,377
It's that important to you?

302
00:28:32,254 --> 00:28:34,548
Come, let me show you something.

303
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,049
Jinsun,

304
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:38,844
you've only... watched a fight from below.

305
00:28:39,052 --> 00:28:41,930
Now you're standing up right here.
Do you feel the difference?

306
00:28:42,973 --> 00:28:44,224
What difference?

307
00:28:47,144 --> 00:28:48,562
When you are down there...

308
00:28:49,438 --> 00:28:51,398
life and death up here has nothing
to do with you.

309
00:28:51,982 --> 00:28:53,567
It's all entertainment.

310
00:28:54,151 --> 00:28:55,444
But when you are up here...

311
00:28:55,903 --> 00:28:57,779
you must not lose. You have to win!

312
00:28:58,489 --> 00:29:00,491
But you can choose not to be here.

313
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:06,163
Jinsun, listen!

314
00:29:09,541 --> 00:29:10,626
To what?

315
00:29:11,668 --> 00:29:13,128
I don't hear anything.

316
00:29:17,674 --> 00:29:19,051
I can hear you...

317
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:22,304
Master Huo, you're our hero!

318
00:29:25,015 --> 00:29:28,769
Great! That's great!

319
00:29:28,977 --> 00:29:30,604
Master is the champion of the world.

320
00:29:56,547 --> 00:29:58,298
Iron head kungfu!

321
00:30:26,451 --> 00:30:27,411
Thanks a lot.

322
00:30:29,329 --> 00:30:31,832
That's great!

323
00:30:32,124 --> 00:30:33,417
Hey! This is taking too long.

324
00:30:33,709 --> 00:30:36,086
Get everyone who has signed a waiver
to come up all at once.

325
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:40,048
All you challengers,
get up there!

326
00:31:31,350 --> 00:31:32,351
Huo Yuanjia,

327
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:35,020
when will you be the Champion of Tianjin?

328
00:31:35,229 --> 00:31:36,313
What do you think?

329
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:39,942
Today! It'll be today!

330
00:31:57,209 --> 00:31:58,919
Let's eat.

331
00:31:59,336 --> 00:32:00,087
Yes, Madam.

332
00:32:02,339 --> 00:32:03,340
You must be hungry.

333
00:32:04,925 --> 00:32:07,970
Here, eat some of this.

334
00:32:16,603 --> 00:32:19,481
What's the matter?

335
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:25,237
We seek to be your disciples...

336
00:32:25,445 --> 00:32:26,655
and devote ourselves to you.

337
00:32:27,739 --> 00:32:29,783
Fine! You may join.

338
00:32:29,992 --> 00:32:31,872
Come on. Give them drinks!
A round for everyone.

339
00:32:36,707 --> 00:32:39,626
Bottoms up and we'll all be brothers!

340
00:32:40,252 --> 00:32:42,004
Come on, come on.

341
00:32:42,379 --> 00:32:44,006
- Come on, come on.
- Master Huo...

342
00:32:44,214 --> 00:32:47,009
Master Huo, congratulations!
You're the true Champion of Tianjin!

343
00:32:49,595 --> 00:32:50,846
See you. Have a good day.

344
00:32:51,054 --> 00:32:54,516
Come on, you're not drinking?

345
00:32:55,225 --> 00:32:57,769
Master Huo's bills are long overdue.

346
00:33:00,522 --> 00:33:01,607
Alright. Alright.

347
00:33:03,734 --> 00:33:06,069
A toast!

348
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,033
Bring a bigger jug!

349
00:33:11,241 --> 00:33:13,361
Hey, you're not drinking?
Now You must drink two more!

350
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:15,579
You have not fought my godfather
Master Chin.

351
00:33:20,083 --> 00:33:21,418
Come on...

352
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:25,088
Yuanjia... You've won
38 contests in a row,

353
00:33:25,297 --> 00:33:26,548
and defeated every fighter in Tianjin.

354
00:33:26,757 --> 00:33:28,342
There's no one left.

355
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:32,221
No, you're wrong.

356
00:33:33,263 --> 00:33:34,543
There is still one left to beat.

357
00:33:36,183 --> 00:33:37,768
So you are not going to stop?

358
00:33:41,897 --> 00:33:45,025
I want to be the true Champion of Tianjin.
I must fight.

359
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:47,569
What about elsewhere?

360
00:33:48,070 --> 00:33:51,114
Beijing, Guangdong, Hunan?

361
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:54,034
When will you stop?

362
00:33:55,577 --> 00:33:58,205
I know what you're saying.

363
00:33:58,622 --> 00:33:59,623
But I cannot stop now.

364
00:33:59,832 --> 00:34:01,041
I need to prove that

365
00:34:01,625 --> 00:34:04,086
I am the best... the strongest.

366
00:34:04,294 --> 00:34:07,172
For what? You will always be you.

367
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:09,216
You'll never become someone else!

368
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:10,759
Yuanjia

369
00:34:11,051 --> 00:34:13,846
I think you should take a break
and reconsider.

370
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,222
What's this?

371
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:22,771
These... are your bills.

372
00:34:24,231 --> 00:34:25,440
I'll take care of it.

373
00:34:26,942 --> 00:34:29,361
All your so-called disciples, only come

374
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,947
for the free drinks and food.

375
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:35,117
You don't understand our circle.

376
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:36,660
Our circle...

377
00:34:38,203 --> 00:34:39,329
Fine.

378
00:34:39,663 --> 00:34:42,040
I will settle the bills tomorow.

379
00:34:42,749 --> 00:34:43,876
Yuanjia,

380
00:34:44,126 --> 00:34:45,961
I am not here for your money

381
00:34:46,378 --> 00:34:48,255
I only want to remind you

382
00:34:48,672 --> 00:34:50,299
Please be careful with the people...

383
00:34:50,507 --> 00:34:53,135
in your inner circle.

384
00:34:53,635 --> 00:34:55,637
Judge them by their integrity,
not their drinking.

385
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:13,989
Good morning, Good
morning, Master Huo!

386
00:35:14,198 --> 00:35:16,617
Good morning, Master Huo!

387
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:19,786
- Good morning, Master Chin!
- Good morning

388
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:32,174
what a coincidence
to run into the...

389
00:35:32,549 --> 00:35:33,989
self-proclaimed Champion of Tianjin!

390
00:35:34,051 --> 00:35:36,720
Master Chin, it's been a long time.

391
00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:39,306
At your age...

392
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:40,849
I thought you'd retired.

393
00:35:41,558 --> 00:35:44,478
Too many disciples.

394
00:35:44,686 --> 00:35:47,064
I cannot retire even if I wanted to.

395
00:35:47,272 --> 00:35:49,608
Oh! Is that so?

396
00:35:50,192 --> 00:35:51,912
Then this big coffin is a gift to yourself?

397
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,070
Enjoy it soon!

398
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,281
You're too kind.

399
00:35:57,699 --> 00:36:00,828
Actually, this is my gift to you!

400
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:07,084
Your master needs help!

401
00:36:09,294 --> 00:36:11,630
Master Chin, this way please!

402
00:36:29,022 --> 00:36:30,065
Stop!

403
00:36:31,984 --> 00:36:35,195
If you want to learn wushu,
you need to work hard at it.

404
00:36:37,614 --> 00:36:40,367
Work hard?

405
00:36:43,745 --> 00:36:47,791
The perfecting of skills
needs time and determination.

406
00:36:48,625 --> 00:36:50,043
Tell me... Stand off!

407
00:36:50,252 --> 00:36:50,919
Stand off!

408
00:36:51,128 --> 00:36:52,129
Stand off!

409
00:36:53,714 --> 00:36:56,794
Give it two or three years, and you will
only have some superficial knowledge.

410
00:36:59,970 --> 00:37:01,597
Well, this is twenty year's practice.

411
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:03,265
Can you handle this?

412
00:37:04,057 --> 00:37:05,100
Go on!

413
00:37:10,647 --> 00:37:11,648
Young master,

414
00:37:12,191 --> 00:37:13,734
the income of the wushu school...

415
00:37:13,942 --> 00:37:15,611
barely covers the household ovenead.

416
00:37:15,986 --> 00:37:18,780
Your disciples have incured

417
00:37:18,989 --> 00:37:20,532
a large expense.

418
00:37:23,368 --> 00:37:24,745
What about the household reserve?

419
00:37:25,245 --> 00:37:28,248
It's been depleted three months ago.

420
00:37:28,916 --> 00:37:32,127
Depleted? Depleted.

421
00:37:34,338 --> 00:37:36,632
Master! Master!

422
00:37:38,926 --> 00:37:41,678
How many times have I told you
to hone your skills.

423
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:42,888
No one listens.

424
00:37:45,265 --> 00:37:46,308
Who did this?

425
00:37:47,518 --> 00:37:48,644
Master Chin!

426
00:37:53,690 --> 00:37:54,858
Master.

427
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:03,826
Master.

428
00:38:08,914 --> 00:38:14,336
We celebrate Master Chin's birthday.

429
00:38:14,545 --> 00:38:18,173
Wishing him good fortune.

430
00:38:18,382 --> 00:38:19,383
Terific!

431
00:38:21,009 --> 00:38:21,844
Godfather!

432
00:38:22,386 --> 00:38:24,388
We wish you good fortune...

433
00:38:24,721 --> 00:38:26,098
and great health.

434
00:38:37,151 --> 00:38:40,028
Wish you a prolong life.

435
00:38:40,237 --> 00:38:41,613
Great! Great!

436
00:38:46,869 --> 00:38:47,661
Master Huo,

437
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:49,663
today's my godfather's birthday.

438
00:38:50,247 --> 00:38:51,540
These tables are reserved.

439
00:38:52,124 --> 00:38:54,710
As a favor to me,
please drink somewhere else.

440
00:38:56,587 --> 00:38:57,987
Master Huo, please do me a favor...

441
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,911
You don't qualify to speak to me.

442
00:39:05,095 --> 00:39:06,054
Hey!

443
00:39:06,638 --> 00:39:08,473
I'm not in the mood to fight...

444
00:39:08,891 --> 00:39:10,267
on my birthday.

445
00:39:10,475 --> 00:39:13,020
Maybe some other time.

446
00:39:16,607 --> 00:39:19,401
You injured my disciple.

447
00:39:19,693 --> 00:39:21,195
You should be ashamed of yourself.

448
00:39:21,528 --> 00:39:24,323
I'm here to settle the score.

449
00:39:25,616 --> 00:39:26,783
What do you want?

450
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:32,206
It's signed.
Do you have the guts to sign it too?

451
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:35,292
Otherwise, get on your knees and apologize.

452
00:39:36,835 --> 00:39:38,378
Yuanjia!

453
00:39:40,964 --> 00:39:41,924
You've crosed the line. Don't be...

454
00:39:42,132 --> 00:39:42,841
so rude in front of his guests.

455
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:45,093
If you've got a problem,
let's talk tomorow.

456
00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:48,263
My disciple's hurt. I must do something.

457
00:39:48,847 --> 00:39:49,928
I don't care what happened,

458
00:39:50,098 --> 00:39:52,893
But you mustn't spoil their celebration.

459
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,232
I'm not here to spoil anything.

460
00:39:58,482 --> 00:39:59,107
Yuanjia!

461
00:39:59,316 --> 00:40:01,109
You think I might trash your place.

462
00:40:01,318 --> 00:40:03,737
I'll pay all damages to the last penny!

463
00:40:08,492 --> 00:40:11,745
How can you talk llike this?

464
00:40:12,955 --> 00:40:14,206
You should go.

465
00:40:14,414 --> 00:40:16,792
Forget that we've ever been friends!

466
00:40:19,545 --> 00:40:21,171
You're asking me to leave?

467
00:40:23,715 --> 00:40:25,384
You're willing to throw away...

468
00:40:26,218 --> 00:40:27,928
our friendship?

469
00:40:30,097 --> 00:40:31,723
Everybody out!

470
00:40:32,766 --> 00:40:34,560
My sword seeks vengeance!

471
00:40:38,021 --> 00:40:39,565
Stay at your own peril!

472
00:45:38,572 --> 00:45:39,823
Master! Master!

473
00:45:40,032 --> 00:45:43,785
The Master has won!

474
00:45:43,994 --> 00:45:47,372
Let's drink!

475
00:47:08,829 --> 00:47:09,913
Master Huo.

476
00:47:13,041 --> 00:47:14,376
Congratulations!

477
00:47:15,335 --> 00:47:16,336
You got your wish.

478
00:47:16,587 --> 00:47:18,255
You're finally the Champion of Tianjin.

479
00:47:19,256 --> 00:47:20,591
You might llike to know...

480
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:24,344
Master Chin died two hours ago.

481
00:47:40,986 --> 00:47:42,237
Huo Yuanjia!

482
00:47:44,531 --> 00:47:47,659
When will you be the Champion?

483
00:47:50,746 --> 00:47:52,414
It'll be today!

484
00:47:52,623 --> 00:47:54,500
It'll be today!

485
00:47:55,334 --> 00:47:56,502
Huo Yuanjia!

486
00:47:57,002 --> 00:47:58,587
It'll be today!

487
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:01,465
It'll be today!

488
00:48:02,341 --> 00:48:03,425
Huo Yuanjia!

489
00:48:03,634 --> 00:48:06,762
Champion of Tianjin! Today is the day!

490
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,070
Yes, I killed your family!

491
00:50:29,238 --> 00:50:30,697
I am responsible.

492
00:50:32,574 --> 00:50:34,493
Godmother, take good care.

493
00:51:23,417 --> 00:51:25,961
Tell the Master the truth.

494
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:27,254
Master,

495
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:29,256
it's all my fault.

496
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,133
I'm very sory.

497
00:51:32,176 --> 00:51:33,677
I was drunk...

498
00:51:34,011 --> 00:51:37,222
I insulted Master Chin's wife.

499
00:51:38,473 --> 00:51:40,684
He was teaching me a leson.

500
00:51:45,397 --> 00:51:50,611
All the brothers knew,
but nobody told you.

501
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:56,283
Master... Master!

502
00:51:57,701 --> 00:52:00,996
Master.

503
00:54:39,029 --> 00:54:43,867
Come along, Yuenjia.

504
00:54:58,340 --> 00:55:00,175
He is burning up.

505
00:55:00,717 --> 00:55:01,677
Let me make some herbal medicine.

506
00:55:01,885 --> 00:55:04,638
He'll feel better.

507
00:55:35,919 --> 00:55:39,006
Drink, my dear.
You'll feel better afterwards.

508
00:56:46,573 --> 00:56:47,699
You woke up.

509
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,662
I will bring you some warm congee.

510
00:57:15,227 --> 00:57:16,812
He's awake, Grandma.

511
00:57:17,020 --> 00:57:18,021
That's good.

512
00:57:24,987 --> 00:57:28,949
Leave it. He's going to sleep.
Let's go

513
00:57:29,741 --> 00:57:32,703
Go.

514
00:57:32,911 --> 00:57:35,164
He's going to sleep. Go.

515
00:58:41,563 --> 00:58:42,606
It's time for lunch.

516
00:58:54,910 --> 00:58:56,495
When I was 13...

517
00:58:56,912 --> 00:58:58,580
my eyesight began to fail.

518
00:58:59,456 --> 00:59:02,417
Everything turned blury.

519
00:59:03,168 --> 00:59:04,711
I cried a lot.

520
00:59:06,213 --> 00:59:07,464
My Grandma told me...

521
00:59:08,465 --> 00:59:10,926
cry if you are sad.

522
00:59:11,385 --> 00:59:13,595
When there are no more tears,
life will go on.

523
00:59:15,806 --> 00:59:18,433
I can see everything in my heart.

524
00:59:18,684 --> 00:59:19,810
Do you believe me?

525
00:59:39,621 --> 00:59:41,165
I'll wash your hair.

526
01:00:26,376 --> 01:00:28,545
Your hair will get knotted...

527
01:00:29,213 --> 01:00:30,923
if you don't wash it often.

528
01:00:33,634 --> 01:00:37,387
Grandma always says...

529
01:00:38,222 --> 01:00:40,307
cleanlines brings purity to life.

530
01:00:41,725 --> 01:00:43,435
Every knot can be untangled.

531
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,040
Huang, you've been through
It's not easy, is it?

532
01:01:02,412 --> 01:01:04,873
So many years with us.

533
01:01:06,959 --> 01:01:10,838
Grandma, Huang doesn't seem to be alright

534
01:01:12,381 --> 01:01:14,925
Everyone has this day.

535
01:01:15,467 --> 01:01:18,595
It's time for Huang to rest.

536
01:01:21,056 --> 01:01:23,892
What about him? He also needs to rest?

537
01:01:24,643 --> 01:01:28,522
He needs a long sleep.

538
01:01:28,856 --> 01:01:33,193
When he wakes up, he will know what to do.

539
01:01:37,906 --> 01:01:39,616
I found this in your clothes.

540
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:48,458
Let's go and let Huang rest.

541
01:02:56,777 --> 01:02:57,861
Ox!

542
01:02:58,654 --> 01:03:00,030
You sleep a lot!

543
01:03:00,239 --> 01:03:02,282
You slept as much as our ox...

544
01:03:02,491 --> 01:03:03,992
that's why we call you Ox.

545
01:03:04,284 --> 01:03:06,078
Come this way.

546
01:03:12,251 --> 01:03:14,378
Ox, you've waken up?

547
01:03:16,463 --> 01:03:18,465
Let's catch some dragonflies. Let's go!

548
01:03:20,843 --> 01:03:22,845
Let's catch some dragonflies.

549
01:05:02,903 --> 01:05:04,488
Let's go, Huang.

550
01:05:10,118 --> 01:05:12,120
Huang, let's go home.

551
01:05:13,247 --> 01:05:14,456
Come on, Grandma here

552
01:05:15,791 --> 01:05:18,669
Huang, no need to come to the field today.
You can rest.

553
01:05:19,294 --> 01:05:21,672
Grandma knows you have tried your best.

554
01:05:22,464 --> 01:05:26,301
Come, come with Grandma.

555
01:05:27,719 --> 01:05:28,762
Ok.

556
01:05:32,224 --> 01:05:33,684
Huang, come with me.

557
01:05:36,687 --> 01:05:38,063
Huang is used to coming

558
01:05:38,355 --> 01:05:40,440
to the field everyday to work.

559
01:05:40,649 --> 01:05:41,984
It's so endurant and hard-working

560
01:05:44,444 --> 01:05:46,164
Now it knows that
it wouldn't live very long

561
01:05:46,530 --> 01:05:49,825
and yet it still wants to help.

562
01:05:51,160 --> 01:05:52,744
It has done so much for us

563
01:05:53,662 --> 01:05:55,622
and never asked anything in return.

564
01:06:51,261 --> 01:06:55,098
Eat something, my dear.
Everything will pas. Eat something.

565
01:07:02,189 --> 01:07:06,276
The men in the city go to the exam.

566
01:07:06,902 --> 01:07:12,574
They will grow
if they succeed in the exam.

567
01:07:13,242 --> 01:07:14,076
Eat something.

568
01:07:15,077 --> 01:07:16,203
Eat more.

569
01:07:19,331 --> 01:07:21,834
Tomorow, you should take him...

570
01:07:22,042 --> 01:07:23,418
to work in the fields.

571
01:07:23,710 --> 01:07:25,587
He'll feel better.

572
01:08:22,561 --> 01:08:23,770
Ox...

573
01:08:53,509 --> 01:08:56,678
Ox... Ox... come...

574
01:08:57,179 --> 01:08:59,765
Come, quick.

575
01:09:01,517 --> 01:09:03,894
Look! Moon told me not to say anything.

576
01:09:04,144 --> 01:09:05,813
You did a bad job.

577
01:09:06,021 --> 01:09:07,773
She is re-planting for you.

578
01:09:27,376 --> 01:09:28,794
Seedlings are alive.

579
01:09:29,294 --> 01:09:31,213
If you plant them too close together...

580
01:09:31,755 --> 01:09:33,298
they will not grow.

581
01:09:34,299 --> 01:09:35,342
Just like people...

582
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:37,636
they need to respect each other...

583
01:09:38,053 --> 01:09:40,013
in order to live together peacefully.

584
01:09:43,100 --> 01:09:44,268
I'll always remember.

585
01:10:40,782 --> 01:10:42,868
I want my Huang...

586
01:10:43,076 --> 01:10:45,621
I want my Huang... I won't let it go.

587
01:10:45,829 --> 01:10:47,873
I want my Huang...

588
01:10:48,081 --> 01:10:51,793
I want my Huang... I won't let it go.

589
01:10:52,002 --> 01:10:52,502
Gui...

590
01:11:00,344 --> 01:11:04,807
Gui, you are too young to understand.

591
01:11:05,182 --> 01:11:07,601
Huang leaves this world in peace,

592
01:11:08,018 --> 01:11:10,979
since he had done what he needed to do.

593
01:11:11,730 --> 01:11:14,149
Everyone dies,

594
01:11:14,483 --> 01:11:15,984
So does Huang.

595
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:20,322
But one only leaves in peace

596
01:11:20,572 --> 01:11:23,867
when there is no regret in one's life.

597
01:11:24,076 --> 01:11:26,537
Don't cry, my boy.

598
01:12:03,073 --> 01:12:06,034
Gui has a problem!

599
01:12:08,245 --> 01:12:09,454
What happened to him?

600
01:12:10,706 --> 01:12:11,832
He mised his bull so much

601
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:14,334
that he stole one from the Siam clan.

602
01:12:14,543 --> 01:12:15,794
He got caught over there

603
01:12:17,421 --> 01:12:20,549
and they are about to punish him
according to their law.

604
01:12:20,757 --> 01:12:25,095
Let's go to save Gui!

605
01:12:35,355 --> 01:12:37,858
Help me...

606
01:12:39,568 --> 01:12:41,528
Help me... Beat him.

607
01:12:46,492 --> 01:12:48,410
Help me...

608
01:12:49,870 --> 01:12:51,413
help me...

609
01:12:53,790 --> 01:12:56,043
Help me...

610
01:12:56,877 --> 01:12:59,129
Are you coming for a fight?

611
01:12:59,379 --> 01:13:02,883
Gui made a mistake and should be punished.

612
01:13:03,258 --> 01:13:05,511
You have already punished him enough.

613
01:13:05,719 --> 01:13:10,474
I'm here to make a formal apology.

614
01:13:12,726 --> 01:13:15,062
The boy doesn't know any better.

615
01:13:15,437 --> 01:13:18,148
Let us take him back.

616
01:13:18,440 --> 01:13:22,194
Indeed he is a child.

617
01:13:22,528 --> 01:13:23,779
But even for children in our village,

618
01:13:23,946 --> 01:13:27,115
we beat them for the burning time
of an incense

619
01:13:28,116 --> 01:13:30,661
so they will remember the leson.

620
01:13:30,911 --> 01:13:31,995
Go on. Beat him.

621
01:13:36,667 --> 01:13:37,709
Help me!

622
01:13:37,918 --> 01:13:40,629
The child can't take it.
Let me take the beating for him!

623
01:13:42,130 --> 01:13:43,257
Stop!

624
01:13:53,767 --> 01:13:55,310
Let me take the beatings for Gui.

625
01:13:57,813 --> 01:13:59,481
Well, this punishment is for children.

626
01:14:05,863 --> 01:14:09,408
Adults should be punished in another way.

627
01:14:09,616 --> 01:14:10,826
How?

628
01:14:14,913 --> 01:14:17,124
Take on my iron fist.

629
01:14:22,337 --> 01:14:24,006
If I am still standing
when this incense burns out,

630
01:14:24,214 --> 01:14:26,884
you will have to release the child.

631
01:14:29,720 --> 01:14:32,806
Sure! No argument about life and death?

632
01:14:35,559 --> 01:14:36,768
No argument!

633
01:14:38,312 --> 01:14:39,813
It's settled then?

634
01:14:40,314 --> 01:14:41,648
Yes.

635
01:14:41,673 --> 01:14:44,673
SharePirate.Com-Movie Stream and Downloads

636
01:15:03,420 --> 01:15:05,297
Grandma, what's wrong with him?

637
01:15:32,950 --> 01:15:35,702
Ox, Ox!

638
01:15:38,413 --> 01:15:40,332
You don't want to hurt others,

639
01:15:41,083 --> 01:15:44,878
but you should let
others hurt you, son!

640
01:15:47,548 --> 01:15:50,384
How can we stand this! Let's help him.

641
01:15:51,802 --> 01:15:52,886
Stop!

642
01:15:53,262 --> 01:15:54,221
Stop!

643
01:15:59,101 --> 01:16:00,477
The incense is still burning.

644
01:16:32,301 --> 01:16:36,096
Stand up, stand up...

645
01:16:36,305 --> 01:16:38,474
Keep beating... beat him.

646
01:16:38,682 --> 01:16:42,352
The incense has burnt out.
You lose, you lose...

647
01:16:48,275 --> 01:16:49,276
Let him go!

648
01:16:52,988 --> 01:16:54,823
Let's go home, Gui. Go.

649
01:17:37,616 --> 01:17:39,701
Time to go home.

650
01:17:39,952 --> 01:17:42,996
I want to stay a little longer with Ox.

651
01:17:43,205 --> 01:17:43,956
I don't go home.

652
01:17:44,164 --> 01:17:45,374
Gui, aren't you hungry?

653
01:17:45,582 --> 01:17:47,143
Are you not hungry? Ox might be hungry.

654
01:17:47,543 --> 01:17:48,544
No, I am not hungry.

655
01:17:48,836 --> 01:17:50,476
I can stay here a little longer with Gui.

656
01:17:51,463 --> 01:17:52,714
Ox, you are the best.

657
01:17:53,131 --> 01:17:54,967
So what does that make me?

658
01:17:57,761 --> 01:17:59,221
Aunt Moon,

659
01:17:59,555 --> 01:18:02,432
can you ask Ox a favor for me?

660
01:18:02,933 --> 01:18:04,143
You and Ox are so close,

661
01:18:04,351 --> 01:18:05,561
why do you need my help?

662
01:18:05,769 --> 01:18:08,438
Because, you are the dearest to Ox.

663
01:18:10,399 --> 01:18:13,902
Don't talk nonsense.

664
01:18:14,945 --> 01:18:18,198
Gui, you can ask me yourself.

665
01:18:18,782 --> 01:18:20,534
You keep refusing to teach me martial arts,
but I really want to learn.

666
01:18:20,742 --> 01:18:21,952
I also want to learn!

667
01:18:22,578 --> 01:18:24,913
Gui, why do you want
to learn martial arts?

668
01:18:25,122 --> 01:18:26,915
So the others won't bully me.

669
01:18:27,457 --> 01:18:28,375
What about you?

670
01:18:28,584 --> 01:18:30,043
I want everyone to be afraid of me.

671
01:18:30,544 --> 01:18:32,264
What if Ning bullies you, what will you do?

672
01:18:32,379 --> 01:18:33,797
I will hit him back

673
01:18:34,798 --> 01:18:36,425
what about you, will you fight Gui back?

674
01:18:36,633 --> 01:18:38,677
For sure.
I will fight Gui until he's scared of me.

675
01:18:38,886 --> 01:18:39,967
What if you can't beat him?

676
01:18:39,970 --> 01:18:41,513
Then, I will learn from a master

677
01:18:42,639 --> 01:18:43,640
Then what will you do?

678
01:18:43,849 --> 01:18:45,976
I will learn from a master

679
01:18:46,185 --> 01:18:47,853
and then fight him again.

680
01:18:49,605 --> 01:18:51,565
You beat him up, and he beats you up.

681
01:18:51,815 --> 01:18:53,984
When will this end?

682
01:18:59,114 --> 01:19:01,408
It's not that I don't want to teach you.

683
01:19:02,868 --> 01:19:04,786
I also need to think about

684
01:19:04,995 --> 01:19:06,455
why we learn martial arts.

685
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:11,001
Let's go and catch the dragonflies!

686
01:19:59,341 --> 01:20:00,101
Grandma, let's eat.

687
01:20:00,175 --> 01:20:01,510
Ok.

688
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:09,351
Grandma

689
01:20:09,685 --> 01:20:12,146
- Moon...
- Yes, Grandma.

690
01:20:13,188 --> 01:20:15,816
In a few days,

691
01:20:16,191 --> 01:20:19,945
we should visit your parents' graves.

692
01:20:20,362 --> 01:20:21,321
Ok.

693
01:20:29,830 --> 01:20:32,791
I am going to... visit
my parents' graves.

694
01:20:45,220 --> 01:20:46,430
Hey, Ox.

695
01:21:57,543 --> 01:21:58,502
Have a drink of water.

696
01:22:05,801 --> 01:22:07,386
Can we talk?

697
01:22:10,305 --> 01:22:11,306
You are leaving...

698
01:22:16,937 --> 01:22:18,272
I was thinking...

699
01:22:18,689 --> 01:22:20,357
maybe I should visit my parents' graves.

700
01:22:22,442 --> 01:22:24,820
You should go. Family is important.

701
01:23:11,325 --> 01:23:12,743
I'll come back soon.

702
01:23:18,874 --> 01:23:20,459
You've been here for many years.

703
01:23:21,126 --> 01:23:24,713
Yet I've always known
one day you will leave.

704
01:23:25,964 --> 01:23:27,174
The truth is, I...

705
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:41,605
Take these clean clothes for your trip.

706
01:23:46,276 --> 01:23:48,237
You don't even know my real name.

707
01:23:50,447 --> 01:23:51,740
You don't have to tell me.

708
01:23:52,616 --> 01:23:55,244
I don't need to know where you're from...

709
01:23:55,911 --> 01:23:57,329
or where you're going.

710
01:23:58,539 --> 01:24:00,499
You will always be "Ox" to me.

711
01:24:06,588 --> 01:24:08,423
My name is Huo Yuanjia.

712
01:24:50,591 --> 01:24:51,967
I'll always remember.

713
01:26:24,101 --> 01:26:27,688
Late Qing Dynasty

714
01:26:28,564 --> 01:26:31,942
Various strong countries invaded China

715
01:26:33,026 --> 01:26:36,530
Tianjin became partly colonized

716
01:27:02,431 --> 01:27:03,474
Believe in God,
and you'll have everlasting life.

717
01:27:03,682 --> 01:27:06,101
His words are written here.

718
01:27:06,268 --> 01:27:08,145
God's words...

719
01:27:35,506 --> 01:27:36,632
Huo Yuanjia!

720
01:27:37,341 --> 01:27:39,760
Champion of Tianjin!

721
01:27:39,968 --> 01:27:41,303
Huo Yuanjia!

722
01:27:42,596 --> 01:27:45,349
Champion of Tianjin! Huo Yuanjia!

723
01:27:47,309 --> 01:27:50,062
Huo Yuanjia has returned to the ring.

724
01:27:52,272 --> 01:27:54,691
Huo Yuanjia has returned to the ring.

725
01:28:40,028 --> 01:28:41,864
- Young master!
- Lai!

726
01:28:42,030 --> 01:28:43,115
You've finally returned!

727
01:28:43,323 --> 01:28:45,659
Good, good... Let
me take your bag.

728
01:29:17,191 --> 01:29:20,068
Please forgive me...

729
01:29:20,569 --> 01:29:22,946
it was not easy maintaining this house.

730
01:29:45,761 --> 01:29:49,556
I did my best...

731
01:29:50,140 --> 01:29:51,433
trying to keep everything...

732
01:29:51,642 --> 01:29:53,185
the way it was.

733
01:29:55,938 --> 01:29:57,378
It must have been very hard for you.

734
01:29:58,106 --> 01:29:59,691
I'm sory for not doing better.

735
01:30:00,192 --> 01:30:01,276
Young Master.

736
01:30:01,485 --> 01:30:02,820
After you left...

737
01:30:03,237 --> 01:30:06,114
the creditors came... to collect money.

738
01:30:06,615 --> 01:30:07,991
Tearing this place...

739
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:10,994
apart.

740
01:30:11,620 --> 01:30:15,332
The house was almost foreclosed.

741
01:30:17,376 --> 01:30:19,795
We would have lost...

742
01:30:20,128 --> 01:30:21,713
everything...

743
01:30:22,172 --> 01:30:25,342
but someone sent money.

744
01:30:26,510 --> 01:30:28,262
I lafter figured...

745
01:30:28,762 --> 01:30:32,766
it was your good friend Mr. Nong Jinsun.

746
01:30:46,822 --> 01:30:48,407
I don't need these anymore.

747
01:30:51,076 --> 01:30:53,912
Neither do... my parents.

748
01:30:57,416 --> 01:30:58,542
Father...

749
01:31:00,002 --> 01:31:01,503
I...

750
01:31:02,421 --> 01:31:05,340
finally realized...

751
01:31:05,883 --> 01:31:08,552
why you held back the last blow.

752
01:31:09,970 --> 01:31:13,182
You are the true Champion.

753
01:31:14,683 --> 01:31:15,976
Mother,

754
01:31:16,685 --> 01:31:19,313
you taught me how to be a good person.

755
01:31:20,981 --> 01:31:23,484
I was too arogant to understand.

756
01:31:27,362 --> 01:31:28,322
Rest asured

757
01:31:28,614 --> 01:31:31,241
I will not disappoint you again.

758
01:31:38,207 --> 01:31:39,249
My dear Jade,

759
01:31:40,584 --> 01:31:43,712
I was not a good father.

760
01:31:45,380 --> 01:31:47,508
And because of me,
you suffered a horible death.

761
01:31:50,928 --> 01:31:52,930
I was never good enough for you.

762
01:32:29,133 --> 01:32:30,259
Let's have tea.

763
01:32:48,068 --> 01:32:49,695
Sir, I am sory.

764
01:32:49,945 --> 01:32:51,225
My bos does not want to see you,

765
01:32:51,405 --> 01:32:53,115
but he wants you to have this.

766
01:33:18,348 --> 01:33:21,393
Watch your way.

767
01:33:23,312 --> 01:33:26,273
Leave a way. Excuse me...

768
01:33:47,669 --> 01:33:51,632
Mrs. Chin, I am very sory
for what I have done.

769
01:33:52,633 --> 01:33:55,594
Please allow me to pay my respects.

770
01:34:13,237 --> 01:34:15,447
Mother. Mother.

771
01:34:42,558 --> 01:34:44,059
Get out and kneel down.

772
01:34:47,271 --> 01:34:49,273
You'll gonna have a hard time
if you come again

773
01:34:49,481 --> 01:34:50,399
You dare to come with no money?

774
01:34:50,607 --> 01:34:51,275
Get away?

775
01:34:51,483 --> 01:34:52,484
Don't come again
or you'll have a hard time.

776
01:34:52,693 --> 01:34:54,570
Get away...

777
01:35:00,742 --> 01:35:01,618
Master...

778
01:35:02,995 --> 01:35:03,745
Master...

779
01:35:04,079 --> 01:35:04,705
Master...

780
01:35:04,913 --> 01:35:06,415
- Master, we are sory!
- We are sory!

781
01:35:08,333 --> 01:35:09,751
Master, I learned kung fu
with you since I was a child.

782
01:35:10,335 --> 01:35:13,172
I don't know another

783
01:35:13,464 --> 01:35:16,049
way to making a living.

784
01:35:16,717 --> 01:35:19,094
Now you are back, and...

785
01:35:20,429 --> 01:35:21,889
Master, please forgive us!

786
01:35:22,764 --> 01:35:23,807
Stand up...

787
01:35:33,442 --> 01:35:37,571
Fresh pork, reasonable price!

788
01:35:42,117 --> 01:35:45,704
Fresh pork... Madam,

789
01:35:45,913 --> 01:35:48,290
Come here, madam...
It's great for making soup.

790
01:35:48,499 --> 01:35:50,375
It is really cheap today.

791
01:35:53,670 --> 01:35:55,350
Two catty (or One Kilogram)
Of pork please!

792
01:35:58,634 --> 01:35:59,718
No busines with you!

793
01:36:26,703 --> 01:36:27,788
Extra release!

794
01:36:27,996 --> 01:36:31,083
Hercules O'Brien...

795
01:36:31,291 --> 01:36:32,668
32 plays without losing one

796
01:36:32,876 --> 01:36:35,462
25 fighters seriuosly injured.

797
01:36:35,671 --> 01:36:37,548
Challenges all Chinese fighters.

798
01:36:37,923 --> 01:36:41,009
Vows to defeat every...
"Sick Man of Asia."

799
01:36:41,218 --> 01:36:43,178
No one dare to challenge him.

800
01:36:46,598 --> 01:36:47,724
Jinsun.

801
01:36:50,477 --> 01:36:51,728
I'm so sory for what I've done.

802
01:36:53,021 --> 01:36:55,149
I realized my mistakes...

803
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:57,693
only too late!

804
01:36:59,236 --> 01:37:00,904
It hurts to think about it.

805
01:37:02,823 --> 01:37:04,533
Let's forget about the past.

806
01:37:05,534 --> 01:37:07,035
That chapter is over.

807
01:37:14,376 --> 01:37:15,586
Jinsun...

808
01:37:16,044 --> 01:37:17,463
I don't know how to begin,

809
01:37:17,671 --> 01:37:19,191
but you're the only one I can turn to.

810
01:37:20,048 --> 01:37:21,592
I need to borow some money.

811
01:37:21,884 --> 01:37:24,011
What? You still want to fight?

812
01:37:25,053 --> 01:37:26,180
Yes.

813
01:37:27,848 --> 01:37:29,641
You cannot go down that path again.

814
01:37:30,267 --> 01:37:32,102
I will not give you any money.

815
01:38:21,068 --> 01:38:22,027
Young Master.

816
01:38:22,820 --> 01:38:23,904
Master Huo,

817
01:38:24,112 --> 01:38:26,114
my master wants you to have this.

818
01:38:30,369 --> 01:38:31,745
Who's your master?

819
01:38:32,162 --> 01:38:34,832
His name is Nong, Nong Jinsun.

820
01:38:40,546 --> 01:38:43,507
The Shanghai Race Club 1909

821
01:38:56,270 --> 01:38:58,355
Ladies and Gentlemen...

822
01:38:58,814 --> 01:39:02,359
Brace yourself... for a man who

823
01:39:02,734 --> 01:39:05,654
can move a train with one hand...

824
01:39:06,071 --> 01:39:08,699
and punch through the Great wall.

825
01:39:09,741 --> 01:39:11,285
He can kill a Chinese fighter...

826
01:39:11,493 --> 01:39:14,413
with his little finger.

827
01:39:15,747 --> 01:39:17,124
Now. Welcome the 9th wonder of the world...

828
01:39:17,332 --> 01:39:22,796
the strongest man in history...
O'Brien!

829
01:39:47,821 --> 01:39:49,781
Today's challenger is...

830
01:39:50,449 --> 01:39:53,410
Huo Yuanjia of Tianjin!

831
01:39:58,248 --> 01:40:00,667
Good!

832
01:40:16,308 --> 01:40:17,851
Sign the Death waiver.

833
01:40:19,561 --> 01:40:20,646
Please inform him,

834
01:40:21,313 --> 01:40:23,440
that taking a life in a competition...

835
01:40:23,649 --> 01:40:25,359
is a cruel and backward tradition.

836
01:40:25,859 --> 01:40:27,736
May I suggest that we compete

837
01:40:27,945 --> 01:40:29,404
with honor and civility.

838
01:40:39,581 --> 01:40:41,917
He wants to kick your butt.

839
01:40:47,798 --> 01:40:50,509
Come On Let the match begin!

840
01:41:01,395 --> 01:41:02,396
Come On

841
01:41:07,860 --> 01:41:08,861
Come On

842
01:41:33,135 --> 01:41:34,261
Good!

843
01:43:46,768 --> 01:43:49,313
Good! Good!

844
01:43:55,068 --> 01:43:56,236
It'an honor.

845
01:44:26,975 --> 01:44:28,185
Thank you.

846
01:44:32,147 --> 01:44:34,274
Good!

847
01:44:44,993 --> 01:44:46,953
Chinese Martial Artist Defeats
US Champion O'Brien

848
01:44:47,079 --> 01:44:49,915
Chinese Fighter Defeats western Boxer.

849
01:44:50,124 --> 01:44:51,416
Victory Shocks Shanghai!

850
01:44:51,625 --> 01:44:55,671
Huo Yuanjia Says wushu Schools Must Unite

851
01:44:56,755 --> 01:44:58,507
Fighter Founds Jingwu Sports Federation.

852
01:44:58,715 --> 01:44:59,800
Recruits Country's Best

853
01:45:01,385 --> 01:45:04,221
Shanghai Foreign Correspondents Club

854
01:45:06,390 --> 01:45:07,474
Thank you.

855
01:45:08,225 --> 01:45:09,143
Master!

856
01:45:09,518 --> 01:45:10,958
You've received a dinner invitation.

857
01:45:21,029 --> 01:45:22,656
I never dreamed it would be you.

858
01:45:23,198 --> 01:45:26,702
I've been waiting for this day, Yuanjia.

859
01:45:29,204 --> 01:45:30,539
Am I still your friend?

860
01:45:31,540 --> 01:45:33,260
Your friendship... is very important to me.

861
01:45:34,168 --> 01:45:35,419
How can I not?

862
01:45:36,044 --> 01:45:39,631
I always knew that you
would not disappoint me.

863
01:45:41,884 --> 01:45:43,886
But I did, for a long time.

864
01:45:45,262 --> 01:45:47,890
Let's not talk about the past.

865
01:45:48,724 --> 01:45:50,559
Come, have a seat.

866
01:45:52,644 --> 01:45:54,855
Here, your favorite wine.

867
01:45:56,690 --> 01:45:57,566
Come on.

868
01:45:59,359 --> 01:46:00,277
What's the matter?

869
01:46:00,569 --> 01:46:02,905
I stopped drinking. A long time ago.

870
01:46:03,572 --> 01:46:05,574
Why?

871
01:46:05,866 --> 01:46:07,826
But you loved to drink.

872
01:46:08,202 --> 01:46:10,370
I've learned from my mistakes.

873
01:46:12,915 --> 01:46:14,041
That's wonderful.

874
01:46:14,833 --> 01:46:17,336
Let's have tea instead.

875
01:46:26,386 --> 01:46:27,387
Yuanjia.

876
01:46:28,931 --> 01:46:32,810
Your victory gained respect
for all Chinese people.

877
01:46:33,435 --> 01:46:35,604
The foreigners have bullied us
for too long.

878
01:46:36,104 --> 01:46:37,940
Someone should stand up.

879
01:46:38,524 --> 01:46:40,192
If that hadn't happened,
they would have continued to see us

880
01:46:40,400 --> 01:46:41,902
as the sick man of East Asia!

881
01:46:42,945 --> 01:46:44,029
My friend...

882
01:46:44,863 --> 01:46:46,281
I'm really proud of you.

883
01:46:47,074 --> 01:46:48,116
Enjoy!

884
01:46:51,078 --> 01:46:52,454
Chinese must get strengthened.

885
01:46:53,580 --> 01:46:55,082
The westerners despised us partially

886
01:46:55,791 --> 01:46:57,501
because we've been busy

887
01:46:57,709 --> 01:46:59,962
fighting among ourselves.

888
01:47:00,879 --> 01:47:03,882
That becomes a laughing stock for others.

889
01:47:07,386 --> 01:47:09,972
Foreigners see us as
the sick man of East Asia!

890
01:47:10,639 --> 01:47:11,974
What they call us is irrelevant.

891
01:47:12,891 --> 01:47:16,728
What matters is if
we are really sick,

892
01:47:18,939 --> 01:47:20,941
or, if we are not attempting to cure

893
01:47:21,191 --> 01:47:24,361
the disease even when
we know it is there.

894
01:47:25,237 --> 01:47:27,114
They still flaut their superiority.

895
01:47:33,495 --> 01:47:37,916
I didn't expect you to be so insightful.

896
01:47:39,376 --> 01:47:44,923
Compared to you, I am kind of bookish.

897
01:47:53,182 --> 01:47:54,141
Jinsun,

898
01:47:54,475 --> 01:47:55,809
when do you return to Tianjin?

899
01:47:56,435 --> 01:47:58,896
I'm going to stay in Shanghai.

900
01:48:00,189 --> 01:48:01,815
Who about your restaurant?

901
01:48:03,609 --> 01:48:04,318
I sold it.

902
01:48:04,526 --> 01:48:05,736
What?

903
01:48:06,236 --> 01:48:07,821
But it was so profitable.

904
01:48:08,363 --> 01:48:10,240
The Jingwu Sports Federation needs...

905
01:48:10,741 --> 01:48:12,493
start-up funds.

906
01:48:15,496 --> 01:48:18,832
But the restaurant has been your life!

907
01:48:19,541 --> 01:48:21,126
My restaurant means little...

908
01:48:21,335 --> 01:48:24,421
compared to... your vision.

909
01:48:25,297 --> 01:48:26,340
Yuanjia.

910
01:48:26,673 --> 01:48:28,342
I do not know wushu.

911
01:48:29,927 --> 01:48:33,597
But I do know how to help.

912
01:48:35,516 --> 01:48:36,725
I hope it will enough.

913
01:48:39,394 --> 01:48:40,395
Jinsun!

914
01:48:41,146 --> 01:48:43,065
I was gone for quite a few years.

915
01:48:44,024 --> 01:48:46,527
Everyday I asked myself

916
01:48:47,069 --> 01:48:49,613
why I learned kung fu,

917
01:48:50,239 --> 01:48:53,867
and whether or not
it was only for fighting.

918
01:48:54,827 --> 01:48:56,245
Have you had an answer?

919
01:48:58,872 --> 01:49:00,124
Only the weak

920
01:49:00,916 --> 01:49:03,794
need to prove their power through force,

921
01:49:05,838 --> 01:49:10,300
but what force leads
to is endles hatred.

922
01:49:11,593 --> 01:49:15,514
I want to change kung
fu into a sport,

923
01:49:16,598 --> 01:49:19,935
with which one can shape oneself
both physically and spiritually.

924
01:49:20,269 --> 01:49:21,395
That's a good idea.

925
01:49:22,437 --> 01:49:24,439
You should let more know about it.

926
01:49:26,316 --> 01:49:28,861
I don't know how much I can achieve,

927
01:49:30,112 --> 01:49:31,655
but I will try my best.

928
01:49:36,827 --> 01:49:38,036
Did you hear that?

929
01:49:38,996 --> 01:49:40,038
Yes,

930
01:49:41,290 --> 01:49:44,376
I heard a voice calling.

931
01:49:46,795 --> 01:49:50,090
Now what we hear
is the same voice!

932
01:49:53,635 --> 01:49:56,889
Jingwu Sports Federation

933
01:50:00,767 --> 01:50:01,643
Yuanjia!

934
01:50:03,437 --> 01:50:05,513
Zhaojian I was wrong
to disrespect you,

935
01:50:06,190 --> 01:50:07,691
Master Huo. I hope that...

936
01:50:08,442 --> 01:50:09,276
I am so glad that you are here.

937
01:50:09,485 --> 01:50:10,944
I was going to pick you up.

938
01:50:11,695 --> 01:50:13,447
Laifu, Master

939
01:50:13,655 --> 01:50:15,199
would you please show Mr. Zhao around?

940
01:50:19,369 --> 01:50:20,329
Yuanjia!

941
01:50:22,706 --> 01:50:25,334
As we've discused, the Jingwu Manifesto.

942
01:50:25,542 --> 01:50:26,585
Take a look.

943
01:50:29,671 --> 01:50:32,508
Our motto:

944
01:50:33,133 --> 01:50:35,803
"Body, Mind and Soul".

945
01:50:37,054 --> 01:50:39,640
Wushu is a way to cultivate one's body,
mind and soul.

946
01:50:40,140 --> 01:50:41,860
All wushu disciplines
are respected equally.

947
01:50:41,975 --> 01:50:44,394
By working together...

948
01:50:46,355 --> 01:50:49,149
we can better ourselves...

949
01:50:49,566 --> 01:50:52,236
and stand strong as one nation

950
01:50:52,528 --> 01:50:56,031
we influence others through...

951
01:50:56,240 --> 01:50:59,660
cooperation, not intimidation.

952
01:50:59,868 --> 01:51:01,036
Through this ideal, we will always...

953
01:51:01,245 --> 01:51:02,704
Stand Strong!

954
01:51:03,872 --> 01:51:05,999
Jingwu Sports Federation 191o

955
01:51:11,046 --> 01:51:12,089
Shanghai Foreign Chamber of Comerce

956
01:51:12,297 --> 01:51:13,924
well, gentlemen, it's too rich for me,

957
01:51:14,133 --> 01:51:16,135
I only bet on sure things.

958
01:51:18,554 --> 01:51:19,994
Then perhaps you'll be interested...

959
01:51:20,055 --> 01:51:22,808
in joining our little wager against this...

960
01:51:23,016 --> 01:51:25,018
Huo Yuanjia fellow?

961
01:51:25,602 --> 01:51:26,895
He'd better lose this time.

962
01:51:27,104 --> 01:51:30,315
It cost me 6,ooo francs
when he beat this O' Brien.

963
01:51:30,816 --> 01:51:32,317
Mr. Mita here...

964
01:51:32,526 --> 01:51:35,571
will ensure that you win back
everything that you lost...

965
01:51:35,779 --> 01:51:37,197
plus a little bit more.

966
01:51:37,489 --> 01:51:40,534
I've suggested a competition
of four matches...

967
01:51:40,742 --> 01:51:43,078
between our countries' best against him.

968
01:51:43,412 --> 01:51:46,999
We beat him and leave
the Chinese with nothing to brag about.

969
01:51:47,207 --> 01:51:48,417
Four against one?

970
01:51:48,709 --> 01:51:51,503
What makes you so sure
he is going to accept that?

971
01:51:51,753 --> 01:51:53,464
Pride? Honor?

972
01:51:53,672 --> 01:51:55,299
The prestige of his school?

973
01:51:55,507 --> 01:51:56,842
It's of no importance.

974
01:51:57,259 --> 01:51:59,219
He has already accepted the challenge.

975
01:51:59,595 --> 01:52:02,139
Then, gentlemen,
I'll take you up on your wager.

976
01:52:02,347 --> 01:52:04,141
And to make it a little more interesting...

977
01:52:04,892 --> 01:52:06,894
I'm going to back the Chinese.

978
01:52:08,270 --> 01:52:11,482
Mita... you are certain
Huo Yuanjia will lose?

979
01:52:11,690 --> 01:52:13,609
With what I have in mind...

980
01:52:14,109 --> 01:52:15,986
our victory is guaranteed.

981
01:52:35,672 --> 01:52:36,548
Yuanjia

982
01:52:38,467 --> 01:52:39,802
One of the contestants

983
01:52:39,968 --> 01:52:42,471
Tanaka, the Japanese fighter...

984
01:52:42,679 --> 01:52:44,014
wishes to meet you.

985
01:52:44,431 --> 01:52:47,935
I heard he remains undefeated.
He is one of the best.

986
01:52:50,813 --> 01:52:53,148
Good, one can always learn from the best.

987
01:52:53,857 --> 01:52:57,069
I suspect that the
Foreign Chamber of Comerce...

988
01:52:57,319 --> 01:52:58,821
might have a hidden agenda.

989
01:52:59,112 --> 01:52:59,992
How can they set up...

990
01:53:00,030 --> 01:53:02,491
a 'one against four' contest?

991
01:53:03,033 --> 01:53:07,037
It is... an attempt
to humiliate us,

992
01:53:07,246 --> 01:53:10,582
and undermine our position.

993
01:53:12,000 --> 01:53:13,043
You're right.

994
01:53:13,752 --> 01:53:16,547
One against four is unfair...

995
01:53:16,922 --> 01:53:18,340
plus I have to win each match.

996
01:53:20,425 --> 01:53:22,010
But not everything in life...

997
01:53:22,845 --> 01:53:25,973
is fair.

998
01:53:28,976 --> 01:53:30,519
For the sake of the Federation,

999
01:53:32,604 --> 01:53:33,814
I have no other choice.

1000
01:53:34,481 --> 01:53:35,691
What if?

1001
01:53:36,984 --> 01:53:40,362
Jinsun,
I want to ask you to do something...

1002
01:53:40,571 --> 01:53:41,530
what is it?

1003
01:53:42,865 --> 01:53:45,993
After this fight,
you should head the Sports Federation.

1004
01:53:46,618 --> 01:53:47,619
Why?

1005
01:53:49,746 --> 01:53:52,916
I want to visit Moon and Grandma.

1006
01:53:53,417 --> 01:53:54,585
I made a promise.

1007
01:54:08,724 --> 01:54:10,350
Do you know anything...

1008
01:54:10,893 --> 01:54:13,103
about teas?

1009
01:54:15,063 --> 01:54:17,733
I don't really want to know...

1010
01:54:18,734 --> 01:54:21,278
because I don't llike categories.

1011
01:54:21,653 --> 01:54:22,821
Tea is tea.

1012
01:54:23,030 --> 01:54:24,948
Each has its own characteristics

1013
01:54:25,157 --> 01:54:26,658
hence different grades.

1014
01:54:29,536 --> 01:54:32,164
What's the purpose of grading?

1015
01:54:33,499 --> 01:54:36,210
All teas are grown in nature...

1016
01:54:36,710 --> 01:54:38,110
with little discernable differences

1017
01:54:38,754 --> 01:54:40,172
So you really don't know teas.

1018
01:54:40,798 --> 01:54:42,925
Once you learn
you can tell the differences.

1019
01:54:43,759 --> 01:54:45,219
Maybe you're right.

1020
01:54:45,552 --> 01:54:47,429
The way I see it...

1021
01:54:47,679 --> 01:54:51,850
the tea does not...
judge itself.

1022
01:54:52,267 --> 01:54:54,186
People...

1023
01:54:54,436 --> 01:54:56,396
judge the tea.

1024
01:54:57,147 --> 01:54:59,149
As for me, I don't want to do that.

1025
01:54:59,358 --> 01:55:01,568
Why not?

1026
01:55:02,152 --> 01:55:04,196
When you are in a good mood,

1027
01:55:04,446 --> 01:55:05,989
the grade of the tea...

1028
01:55:07,032 --> 01:55:09,493
does not matter.

1029
01:55:10,119 --> 01:55:12,538
I've never seen it that way.

1030
01:55:12,746 --> 01:55:16,500
In your opinion,
is one style of wushu superior...

1031
01:55:17,209 --> 01:55:20,754
to another?

1032
01:55:21,255 --> 01:55:22,589
I don't think so.

1033
01:55:24,133 --> 01:55:26,885
If no particular style is superior...

1034
01:55:27,845 --> 01:55:29,805
why have...

1035
01:55:30,514 --> 01:55:32,266
so many competitions?

1036
01:55:32,808 --> 01:55:34,977
I believe...

1037
01:55:35,227 --> 01:55:37,479
no single style is superior.

1038
01:55:37,896 --> 01:55:40,524
Only different skill levels.

1039
01:55:41,441 --> 01:55:42,901
It is through training that...

1040
01:55:43,110 --> 01:55:45,028
one discovers one's strength.

1041
01:55:46,155 --> 01:55:48,157
Perhaps, the most formidable...

1042
01:55:48,490 --> 01:55:49,908
enemy lies within onself.

1043
01:55:50,534 --> 01:55:54,329
Competitions can lead us
to a path of self-discovery?

1044
01:55:54,913 --> 01:55:57,124
You mean... our most
important battle...

1045
01:55:57,332 --> 01:55:58,750
is actually fought within?

1046
01:56:09,636 --> 01:56:14,183
Your words are poignant.

1047
01:56:16,977 --> 01:56:22,191
Let's... enjoy the tea.

1048
01:56:22,649 --> 01:56:25,694
- Please enjoy.
- Thank you.

1049
01:57:54,074 --> 01:57:58,162
Shanghai 1910

1050
01:58:00,622 --> 01:58:03,876
French Concession Pierre Theatre

1051
01:58:06,336 --> 01:58:08,297
The Fight Arena

1052
01:58:39,995 --> 01:58:42,581
Today's battle

1053
01:58:42,790 --> 01:58:45,667
is between four fighters
from the Foreign Chamber of Comerce

1054
01:58:45,834 --> 01:58:48,879
and Huo Yuanjia
of the Jingwu Sports Federation.

1055
01:58:58,889 --> 01:59:00,682
Whichever side falls first

1056
01:59:00,891 --> 01:59:02,601
or signals to admit defeat

1057
01:59:02,810 --> 01:59:05,896
will be considered to have lost the match.

1058
01:59:07,689 --> 01:59:09,316
This is unusual.

1059
01:59:10,984 --> 01:59:12,778
Four against one?

1060
01:59:14,446 --> 01:59:16,198
You never told me.

1061
01:59:16,448 --> 01:59:17,866
Both the Chamber of Comerce...

1062
01:59:18,075 --> 01:59:20,077
and the Federation agreed.

1063
01:59:20,285 --> 01:59:21,495
Don't be concerned.

1064
01:59:21,787 --> 01:59:23,956
This is not a competition.

1065
01:59:25,415 --> 01:59:26,750
This is murder.

1066
01:59:26,959 --> 01:59:29,044
Tanaka, you're overeacting.

1067
01:59:29,586 --> 01:59:31,797
Huo Yuanjia fought the best fighters...
from around the world.

1068
01:59:32,005 --> 01:59:33,006
And won each time.

1069
01:59:33,215 --> 01:59:35,634
The rules... he set them up.

1070
01:59:35,843 --> 01:59:37,177
Mita,

1071
01:59:38,971 --> 01:59:40,639
what's your deal?

1072
01:59:41,723 --> 01:59:43,559
Is this really for the pride of Japan?

1073
01:59:43,725 --> 01:59:45,310
Or did you place a large bet?

1074
01:59:47,271 --> 01:59:48,730
The spirit Of wushu...

1075
01:59:49,314 --> 01:59:50,858
is the most important thing.

1076
01:59:54,319 --> 01:59:55,988
To compete is to win.

1077
01:59:56,822 --> 01:59:59,616
Now the first round!
Huo Yuanjia against the British boxer!

1078
02:00:03,912 --> 02:00:06,665
British Boxer, Peter Smith

1079
02:00:11,712 --> 02:00:12,379
Start!

1080
02:00:47,706 --> 02:00:50,751
Belgium Royal Riding Coach, Hanks Herzog

1081
02:01:46,390 --> 02:01:47,474
Great job, master!

1082
02:01:57,109 --> 02:02:00,195
Fencing champion of Europe, Antony Kasia

1083
02:03:07,387 --> 02:03:09,515
This is our embarrassment.
We can't let him win.

1084
02:03:19,775 --> 02:03:21,568
The fourth and
final contest will now begin.

1085
02:03:21,777 --> 02:03:24,571
The competitor to represent
the Foreign Chamber of Comerce...

1086
02:03:24,780 --> 02:03:27,616
is Tanaka from Japan.

1087
02:03:31,245 --> 02:03:32,079
Begin!

1088
02:03:32,830 --> 02:03:34,039
Yuanjia.

1089
02:03:34,498 --> 02:03:37,042
This is an unfair contest.

1090
02:03:37,835 --> 02:03:40,796
If you wish to re-schedule...

1091
02:03:41,088 --> 02:03:43,006
that's fine with me.

1092
02:03:43,715 --> 02:03:45,384
You're very kind.

1093
02:03:46,051 --> 02:03:47,970
We started the fight...

1094
02:03:48,637 --> 02:03:49,930
we must finish.

1095
02:03:51,098 --> 02:03:51,890
Please!

1096
02:04:09,992 --> 02:04:10,659
Begin!

1097
02:05:20,395 --> 02:05:21,438
Master, that's great!

1098
02:06:08,694 --> 02:06:10,404
This round is a draw.

1099
02:06:10,988 --> 02:06:13,115
Please set down your weapons, gentlemen...

1100
02:06:13,615 --> 02:06:15,367
and prepare for hand-to-hand combat.

1101
02:06:19,079 --> 02:06:20,622
Mita, where have you been?

1102
02:06:20,956 --> 02:06:22,596
This is embarrassing. He's going to lose.

1103
02:06:23,417 --> 02:06:25,961
Don't wory, gentlemen.
I have it under control.

1104
02:07:21,141 --> 02:07:21,892
Yuanjia!

1105
02:07:35,030 --> 02:07:36,073
Time out!

1106
02:07:36,865 --> 02:07:39,827
- What's going on?
- What is he doing?

1107
02:07:44,039 --> 02:07:44,539
Yuanjia!

1108
02:07:44,665 --> 02:07:47,167
- Tanaka!
- Go now! Go! Go!

1109
02:07:52,339 --> 02:07:54,007
What happened? What happened?

1110
02:07:55,092 --> 02:07:55,968
What happened?

1111
02:07:56,176 --> 02:07:57,094
Poisoned!

1112
02:07:57,302 --> 02:08:00,139
Poison? What poison?

1113
02:08:00,556 --> 02:08:01,890
How did this happen?

1114
02:08:03,142 --> 02:08:06,103
- What do you need?
- Tea... Tea!

1115
02:08:06,478 --> 02:08:07,563
Where's the teapot?

1116
02:08:08,355 --> 02:08:11,733
The tea is laced. But it's gone!

1117
02:08:11,942 --> 02:08:14,361
We're going straight to the hospital.

1118
02:08:15,779 --> 02:08:20,409
Too late. The toxin is...
in my blood!

1119
02:08:20,617 --> 02:08:22,536
Let me take revenge.

1120
02:08:25,414 --> 02:08:26,623
Sheng,

1121
02:08:28,750 --> 02:08:30,335
we...

1122
02:08:31,128 --> 02:08:32,421
must not.

1123
02:08:35,632 --> 02:08:36,884
Revenge only...

1124
02:08:37,634 --> 02:08:39,803
brings more bloodshed.

1125
02:08:41,472 --> 02:08:43,056
No more revenge.

1126
02:08:45,851 --> 02:08:49,146
We must strive to better ourselves.

1127
02:08:49,354 --> 02:08:52,566
Forget the competition.

1128
02:08:52,774 --> 02:08:54,943
We're going to hospital.

1129
02:08:58,614 --> 02:08:59,782
Jinsun.

1130
02:09:01,116 --> 02:09:03,118
It took me years to understand...

1131
02:09:05,037 --> 02:09:08,791
the true meaning of wushu,

1132
02:09:10,584 --> 02:09:12,586
and its purpose.

1133
02:09:14,004 --> 02:09:15,756
The competition must continue.

1134
02:09:17,216 --> 02:09:20,803
One cannot choose...
how one's life begins.

1135
02:09:23,263 --> 02:09:26,767
But one can choose...
to face the end with courage.

1136
02:09:32,689 --> 02:09:33,941
Master.

1137
02:09:34,441 --> 02:09:36,819
What are you doing?
Finish him off in the next round!

1138
02:09:37,027 --> 02:09:38,153
Why do you say that?

1139
02:09:39,154 --> 02:09:40,405
It's not for you to decide.

1140
02:09:40,614 --> 02:09:41,865
I must win this fight!

1141
02:09:42,074 --> 02:09:43,909
Whatever it takes. Just win!

1142
02:09:52,626 --> 02:09:54,336
We... Stand strong!

1143
02:09:54,545 --> 02:10:02,545
Stand strong! Stand strong!

1144
02:10:04,388 --> 02:10:05,430
You really want to win?

1145
02:10:26,535 --> 02:10:27,661
Let's stop.

1146
02:10:28,245 --> 02:10:30,831
Treasure your life.

1147
02:10:33,417 --> 02:10:34,376
Listen to them...

1148
02:10:36,044 --> 02:10:38,005
it's not just about me.

1149
02:10:44,011 --> 02:10:44,971
If you wish to continue,

1150
02:10:45,554 --> 02:10:48,140
I won't hold back.

1151
02:10:50,392 --> 02:10:51,727
It is my honor.

1152
02:12:54,433 --> 02:12:56,018
Young Master...

1153
02:12:57,519 --> 02:12:59,480
He's down! He's down!
Huo Yuanjia's down!

1154
02:12:59,730 --> 02:13:02,941
Go! Go! Go!

1155
02:13:03,150 --> 02:13:04,568
Make the announcement!

1156
02:13:11,241 --> 02:13:12,701
Wait!

1157
02:13:35,390 --> 02:13:36,350
Huo...

1158
02:13:36,767 --> 02:13:39,019
Yuan... Jia!

1159
02:13:39,353 --> 02:13:41,021
Yuanjia!

1160
02:13:41,230 --> 02:13:49,230
Huo Yuanjia! Huo Yuanjia!
Huo Yuanjia! Huo Yuanjia!

1161
02:14:01,959 --> 02:14:03,168
Tanaka, you son-of-a bitch.

1162
02:14:03,377 --> 02:14:04,920
What is this?

1163
02:14:05,129 --> 02:14:06,004
I lost!

1164
02:14:06,213 --> 02:14:07,965
Who said you lost?

1165
02:14:08,340 --> 02:14:10,050
I know it in my heart.

1166
02:14:10,425 --> 02:14:11,510
I lost. Fair and square.

1167
02:14:12,219 --> 02:14:13,428
Who do you think you are?

1168
02:14:13,637 --> 02:14:14,847
You have no right to decide.

1169
02:14:15,097 --> 02:14:17,057
You can't be Japanese.

1170
02:14:26,150 --> 02:14:29,778
You are a disgrace to Japan!

1171
02:14:31,738 --> 02:14:39,738
Huo Yuanjia! Huo Yuanjia!

1172
02:16:35,946 --> 02:16:40,826
Huo Yuanjia died from poisoning
at the age of 42.

1173
02:16:42,327 --> 02:16:44,079
"The spirit of wushu" as espoused
by Huo Yuanjia continues to

1174
02:16:44,288 --> 02:16:46,206
spread and thrive long
after he pased away...

1175
02:16:46,415 --> 02:16:48,500
today, the Jingwu Sports
Federation flourishes around the world,

1176
02:16:48,709 --> 02:16:50,109
with branches in over 5o countries.

1177
02:16:50,919 --> 02:16:52,713
To commemorate Huo Yuenjia's spirit.

1178
02:16:52,921 --> 02:16:54,801
Inscribed by Sun Zhongshan,
Father of the nation

1179
02:16:55,591 --> 02:16:58,594
To uphold the spirit of wushu by Sunwen

1180
02:18:01,448 --> 02:18:02,866
Excuse me! Mis. Yang?

1181
02:18:03,242 --> 02:18:04,493
What are your chances?

1182
02:18:04,743 --> 02:18:06,745
I did my best. That's what's important.

1183
02:18:06,954 --> 02:18:08,330
Is it enough?
