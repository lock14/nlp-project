00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:50,007
<i>Give me audio on that,
please.</i>

3
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:54,050
<i>Right turn on Royal.</i>

4
00:00:54,154 --> 00:00:57,123
<i>Can you zoom in?
All right. Now pan right.</i>

5
00:00:57,223 --> 00:01:01,319
<i>Yes, that's affirmative.
Male, late 30s.</i>

6
00:01:01,428 --> 00:01:03,988
<i> Group of six males, Quadrant 9.</i>
<i>Give me the middle one.</i>

7
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:05,758
<i>N.G. Not a match.</i>

8
00:01:05,865 --> 00:01:08,425
<i>Agent 4-86, squawk and ident.
Need your position.</i>

9
00:01:08,535 --> 00:01:10,799
<i>Camera's on Decatur,
now online.</i>

10
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,337
<i>I'm heading north on Clinton.</i>

11
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:14,669
<i>Let's get a sweep moving
southeast on Toulouse.</i>

12
00:01:14,774 --> 00:01:17,800
<i>Strike that.</i>
<i>On Conti- 800 block.</i>

13
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:21,938
<i>I'm going to change position.</i>

14
00:01:22,048 --> 00:01:24,448
<i>- Two out of five, no good.</i>
<i>- That's no good.</i>

15
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:27,145
<i>Come back around on Exchange</i>
<i>and head north.</i>

16
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,448
<i>I'm moving onto
Burgundy Street now.</i>

17
00:01:29,556 --> 00:01:32,252
<i>It's got some dropouts on the feed there.</i>

18
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:34,553
<i>Possible target heading
northeast on Bourbon.</i>

19
00:01:34,661 --> 00:01:36,629
<i>Fifty yards from St. Louis.</i>

20
00:01:36,729 --> 00:01:39,960
<i> Southwest corner.</i>
<i>Target is wearing a red shirt and shoulder bag.</i>

21
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:43,365
<i> I see the target.</i>
<i>I'm too far out for a facial lock.</i>

22
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,634
<i>I've got him. Red shirt.</i>

23
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,106
<i>No good. Face is turned.</i>

24
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,371
<i>Static camera missed him too.</i>

25
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,779
<i> Gator's got eyes on him.</i>
<i>I'm heading back around the perimeter.</i>

26
00:01:56,883 --> 00:02:00,148
<i>Gator, he's a 120 yards
ahead to the left.</i>

27
00:02:00,253 --> 00:02:02,278
<i>I'm right behind him.</i>

28
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,379
Looks real close.

29
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,516
Can't get a clear shot.

30
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:10,323
<i> He's coming up on your left.</i>
<i>Suspect in red continuing on Conti Street.</i>

31
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,797
<i>Rabbit got him. Full face.</i>

32
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,800
Give me a sec.

33
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:20,739
Beginning scan.

34
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:26,406
Negative. It's not a match.

35
00:02:26,513 --> 00:02:28,378
Okay, Bulldog, take the northwest quad.

36
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:30,813
<i>Gator, hold firm, cover that east bank.</i>

37
00:02:32,252 --> 00:02:35,244
Samuel's in position?

38
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:37,152
We're just waiting on Miles, sir.

39
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:39,691
<i> Need a whole new sweep</i>
<i>of the area starting in Quad 1.</i>

40
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:43,455
<i>Let's get all bank "A"cameras online.</i>

41
00:02:43,696 --> 00:02:47,291
<i>Danny?
You're not feeding the dog, are you?</i>

42
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,368
<i>No. I'm looking for my badge.</i>

43
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:52,529
They give you two things when you're a cop-
a gun and a badge.

44
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:56,040
I have one.
I can't find my badge.

45
00:02:56,142 --> 00:02:59,202
- It's on the thingy.
- The thing, the thing?

46
00:02:59,312 --> 00:03:02,338
I was just over by the thing.
It's not there.

47
00:03:02,448 --> 00:03:04,780
Shortie, remember our plan.
You're gonna stay strong, I'm gonna give you food.

48
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,079
Just don't tell Mom
I gave you that, all right?

49
00:03:07,187 --> 00:03:10,782
Daniel Fisher. Hmm?

50
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:13,017
I'm tryin' to build
the world's most dominant pug.

51
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:15,390
He's going through a bulking phase.
Look at him.

52
00:03:15,495 --> 00:03:18,191
Come here, Shortie.
Come on. Daddy's bad.

53
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,528
Come here.
I'll show you the thingy.

54
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,225
The thing.
"It's by the thing."

55
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:24,633
<i>I was just by the thing.</i>
<i>It's not there.</i>

56
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:27,228
- I was just-
- The thingy.

57
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,274
- This is the thing.
- Yeah.

58
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,741
- I didn't know you meant that thing.
- Course not.

59
00:03:31,844 --> 00:03:36,110
<i>It's here. You know,</i>
<i>I still got, like, 10 minutes.</i>

60
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,309
Yeah? It only takes you two, honey.
Come on.

61
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,546
I think it's a strong two.

62
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:49,957
Go to work.
Be safe, okay?

63
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:54,628
Okay. Go.

64
00:03:54,734 --> 00:03:56,429
Love you, Shortie.

65
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:00,734
- Hey, Hank!
- Hey, Molly!

66
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,673
Come on.

67
00:04:03,776 --> 00:04:07,940
Aw, shit. I am definitely not smarter
than a fifth grader.

68
00:04:10,917 --> 00:04:12,817
<i>Do you need backup?</i>

69
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,819
Hey, man. What's going on?

70
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:18,618
So you, uh-you gotta get permission from
the old lady and the dog now to come to work?

71
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:22,456
Just the dog.

72
00:04:22,562 --> 00:04:24,928
<i>Hey, homework.</i>

73
00:04:25,031 --> 00:04:27,124
F.B.I.'s tracking this guy through the Quarter.
They need some hand-holding.

74
00:04:32,572 --> 00:04:34,472
Coming out of the hotel.

75
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:36,269
<i>Target matches four out of five points.</i>

76
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,207
Gator's on Royal, 200 block.

77
00:04:38,311 --> 00:04:42,008
All available agents, scramble.
We need a clear lock. Get audio in place.

78
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:45,016
He's moving towards Bourbon.
I'm 50 yards back.

79
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,986
<i>Come on, people.</i>
<i>I can't afford to lose this guy again.</i>

80
00:04:49,088 --> 00:04:51,022
<i>I'm in position,</i>
<i>target heading towards me.</i>

81
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,024
<i>Clear shot.</i>

82
00:04:56,596 --> 00:04:58,655
Hold position.

83
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,494
- Sir, the locals need-
- Shut up!

84
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,568
Show me that Irish bastard.

85
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:17,310
Confirmed. All teams,
we have a positive I.D. on Miles Jackson.

86
00:05:17,417 --> 00:05:20,318
<i>You want to see the face of the devil?</i>
<i>There it is.</i>

87
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:24,618
<i>Brought down Trans Atlantic Flight 212.</i>
<i>Bombed the American Embassy in Frankfurt.</i>

88
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:28,182
The man decapitated his own brother
for blowing a deal in Tangiers.

89
00:05:28,294 --> 00:05:30,421
It's game day, people.
Let's go.

90
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:32,555
Got him.

91
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,895
- He's got his cell phone out now.
- Sir, he's making the call.

92
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,733
Hey, open up Samuel's feed.

93
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,572
It's an incoming call, sir.
Still encrypted.

94
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,246
Fifteen minutes.
The abandoned wharf on Permission Way.

95
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:53,876
Miles is bringing the weapons,
and we're making the exchange.

96
00:05:56,622 --> 00:05:58,920
<i> I got three tapped cameras,</i>
<i>including the harbor crane.</i>

97
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,017
- I need Team 1 to get me set up inside.
- Samuel, remember our deal.

98
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:05,359
You ever want to see your brother again,
you do as I say when I say it.

99
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,866
We get Miles, we get the weapons,
you and Joshua get your freedom.

100
00:06:08,968 --> 00:06:11,232
<i>- Clear?</i>
<i>- Claro.</i>

101
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:13,764
Now we dance.

102
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:21,040
- No! Hey, hey. No, no, no, no, no.
- Hang on. He stopped.

103
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:24,605
Let's see.
He takes your bishop knight to c4...

104
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:26,617
pawn to a7, rook to block.

105
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,882
He takes your queen.
It's all over but the crying.

106
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:33,550
Try, uh, pawn to a6.
It's better.

107
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,395
He's heading east.

108
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,730
<i>He's hailing a cab.</i>

109
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:45,827
Mobile Unit 6 has video on him,
hundred yards back.

110
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,805
<i>Send N.O.P.D. the new pics on Miles.</i>

111
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:51,877
Have them establish
a 10-block perimeter around the wharf.

112
00:06:51,978 --> 00:06:55,175
- Sir, should you call the director?
- No.

113
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:58,182
This is the first time Miles has been
out in the open in two years.

114
00:06:58,284 --> 00:07:00,385
The director has no idea
you're about to cut a deal.

115
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:00,980
There is no deal.

116
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,113
We use Samuel and Joshua to get to Miles.
We bring 'em all down.

117
00:07:04,223 --> 00:07:08,751
Nobody's going anywhere, Ray.
This time, he's not getting away from me.

118
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:16,096
Just give me the scoop, man.
So, you gonna pop the question, or what?

119
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:19,330
I'm just saying, you know, you move in
with the lady, the ring usually comes next.

120
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,873
Bro, it's been two weeks.

121
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:25,307
- And?
- Yeah, you've lived with, like, 14 different girls.

122
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:29,211
Why, yes, I did. But I'm sexier than you.

123
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:31,681
I mean, if a freakishly large man
such as yourself...

124
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:34,981
is gonna keep a fine woman like Molly,
you're gonna have to put her in cuffs.

125
00:07:46,766 --> 00:07:48,563
E.T.A: two minutes.
Cameras are up inside the wharf.

126
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,361
<i>Punctual, Sam. I like that.</i>

127
00:08:17,463 --> 00:08:20,432
<i>- We got audio now. Reading five by five.</i>
- Okay, we're in first position.

128
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,558
All teams, on my mark.

129
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:27,105
We get Miles to lead us to the location
of the guns, we proceed with extract.

130
00:08:28,875 --> 00:08:33,244
Okay, so... this is how
this rodeo is gonna work.

131
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,712
<i>You give me the briefcase...</i>

132
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:39,182
I give you the P.D.A.
with the coordinates to the weapons.

133
00:08:39,285 --> 00:08:42,277
- It's all very simple.
- No.

134
00:08:44,056 --> 00:08:46,547
I can't do this.

135
00:08:46,659 --> 00:08:49,457
Don't you do this, you son of a bitch.

136
00:08:49,562 --> 00:08:51,792
You can't do what?

137
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:54,560
I set you up.

138
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:03,301
<i>The F.B.I. knows you're here.</i>
<i>They're watching us right now.</i>

139
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:05,707
They-They know you're here.

140
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:09,641
And now I'm never gonna
see my brother again.

141
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:22,760
Half an hour, Lake Pontchartrain Causeway.

142
00:09:22,862 --> 00:09:25,057
You bring me my brother,
I'll bring you Miles.

143
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,428
That is, of course,
if he makes it that long.

144
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:42,679
- Holy shit.
- Hey, let's move.

145
00:09:42,782 --> 00:09:44,764
Get me an outside feed.
Give me the outside feeds!

146
00:09:44,765 --> 00:09:45,114
You got it.

147
00:10:16,749 --> 00:10:19,398
Sir, we need to stop 'em
before they get to the bridge.

148
00:10:19,399 --> 00:10:20,344
Get me a 20 on Joshua.

149
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:22,944
- Samuel is gonna try to get his brother.
- You want to make a deal?

150
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:24,955
Ray, pick up the phone!

151
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:31,359
The F.B.I. told us exactly where
they were positioned. Go around.

152
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:33,364
<i>Okay.</i>

153
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:37,300
You all right?

154
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,571
It's gonna bruise like a bitch.

155
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,714
You're lucky I didn't aim any lower.

156
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,011
Man, it's just like those pansy-ass feds.

157
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:55,644
I mean, they call us, we jump right away.

158
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:59,816
<i>We call them, city's under seven feet of water-</i>
<i>Hey, five days. Take it easy.</i>

159
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,189
Those guys skin my ass, Danny,
they really do.

160
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:05,923
Look at this guy-
arms trafficking, espionage, murder.

161
00:11:06,032 --> 00:11:08,728
Hell, he even sold two dirty bombs
in Paris last year.

162
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:10,392
Interpol says he's got
two more on the market.

163
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,165
Like the city needs more to deal with?

164
00:11:13,272 --> 00:11:16,537
I mean, really, why can't they take that crap
someplace else- Kansas, Iowa?

165
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:19,008
Helsinki.

166
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:22,342
<i> All units, we're at black.</i>
<i>F.B.I. requests assistance.</i>

167
00:11:22,448 --> 00:11:24,143
<i>Sending target information.</i>

168
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,343
<i>Eight male suspects, three vehicles</i>
<i>heading to Lake Pontchartrain Causeway.</i>

169
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:29,910
- Sounds like the feds dropped the ball again.
- Surprised?

170
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:44,796
Someone broke into the safe house.
They took Joshua and killed our agents.

171
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:47,202
- He did it again.
- How do you want to proceed with the convoy?

172
00:11:49,075 --> 00:11:50,702
Well, take 'em!

173
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:51,435
Take 'em.

174
00:11:57,582 --> 00:12:01,609
I threw in an extra five percent,
for treating my brother and I so well.

175
00:12:03,054 --> 00:12:05,079
- Was it any trouble getting him out?
- For me?

176
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:10,628
Nah. For the two guards
I had to kill, maybe.

177
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:13,289
- And he's waiting at the airfield?
- Yeah, he's there right now.

178
00:12:13,398 --> 00:12:15,662
Why don't you give him a call?

179
00:12:17,269 --> 00:12:19,669
<i>You know what the funny thing is, Sam?</i>

180
00:12:19,771 --> 00:12:21,932
If I hadn't have found out the F.B.I.
was holding your brother...

181
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:23,940
<i>as a bargaining chip to catch me...</i>

182
00:12:24,042 --> 00:12:27,409
<i>you'd have gone along with this whole
double-cross without so much as a consideration.</i>

183
00:12:27,512 --> 00:12:30,106
And I'd be out of my hard-earned cash.

184
00:12:30,215 --> 00:12:34,481
The F.B.I. would probably
have me in custody...

185
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:36,486
and you and your douche bag brother...

186
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:40,024
would be holding hands somewhere
in the south of France.

187
00:12:43,528 --> 00:12:46,156
Yeah? Hello.

188
00:12:46,264 --> 00:12:50,997
I'm sorry. Joshua can't come to the phone
right now, but thanks for the ride.

189
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:21,204
Oldest trick in the book, Sam.

190
00:13:21,315 --> 00:13:23,306
Turn their heads with one hand...

191
00:13:23,417 --> 00:13:26,648
quietly slip out the back with the other.

192
00:13:38,432 --> 00:13:40,297
Later.

193
00:13:47,942 --> 00:13:51,036
- Right on time, baby.
- Aren't I always?

194
00:13:52,413 --> 00:13:54,074
Mmm!

195
00:14:01,455 --> 00:14:03,821
Show me.

196
00:14:10,131 --> 00:14:14,830
<i>We can finally afford that pony</i>
<i>that you've always wanted.</i>

197
00:14:14,936 --> 00:14:18,929
I'll drive.

198
00:14:20,408 --> 00:14:21,807
- Whoo!
- Right.

199
00:14:25,146 --> 00:14:29,378
<i> F.B.I. update. Suspects in custody,</i>
<i>but Miles Jackson is still at large.</i>

200
00:14:29,483 --> 00:14:32,941
<i>Looking for gray van, Louisiana plates:</i>
<i>Alpha-Golf-November-803.</i>

201
00:14:33,054 --> 00:14:35,682
<i>- Stand by.</i>
- Unit 14 en route for Lower Nine.

202
00:14:37,725 --> 00:14:40,819
Whoa!

203
00:14:42,563 --> 00:14:44,895
Uh, my bad.

204
00:14:46,667 --> 00:14:49,534
<i>I didn't even see that guy.</i>

205
00:14:58,613 --> 00:15:00,547
Turn around.

206
00:15:00,648 --> 00:15:04,209
Turn-What are you talkin' about?
Danny, we're at black. We gotta get over there.

207
00:15:04,318 --> 00:15:06,912
We gotta stop that car.
That's the girl- the girl in the car.

208
00:15:07,021 --> 00:15:09,251
Oh, Jesus. All right.

209
00:15:13,327 --> 00:15:15,295
<i>Headquarters to 5-21.</i>

210
00:15:21,502 --> 00:15:23,094
Pull over, please.

211
00:15:32,613 --> 00:15:35,514
Come on. You heard Dispatch.
We're lookin' for an Irish dude in a gray van.

212
00:15:35,616 --> 00:15:39,108
- You think this is a good idea?
- Just ask her the questions.

213
00:15:44,992 --> 00:15:48,018
Such a waste of time.

214
00:15:58,472 --> 00:16:00,804
License and registration, ma'am.

215
00:16:00,908 --> 00:16:03,433
<i>Evening, Officer. What'd I-</i>
<i>What seems to be the problem?</i>

216
00:16:03,544 --> 00:16:07,275
- Evening. License and registration, please.
- Yeah, of course.

217
00:16:08,416 --> 00:16:11,146
Hope I'm not in any sort of trouble.

218
00:16:13,754 --> 00:16:15,551
How does everything look?

219
00:16:17,558 --> 00:16:20,755
Oh, outstanding.

220
00:16:20,861 --> 00:16:23,989
But tell me, what's a pretty lady like you
doin' drivin' all by herself...

221
00:16:24,098 --> 00:16:26,225
through a neighborhood like this?

222
00:16:26,334 --> 00:16:30,065
Sometimes I like to be alone.
Sometimes I don't.

223
00:16:32,907 --> 00:16:36,070
- Uh, give me a second.
- Yeah. No problem.

224
00:16:37,611 --> 00:16:41,172
Dude, do you wanna see her face?

225
00:16:43,851 --> 00:16:46,649
- Here. Thank you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

226
00:16:46,754 --> 00:16:48,153
<i>Listen...</i>

227
00:16:48,255 --> 00:16:52,248
here's my card, you know,
for those times when you don't.

228
00:16:54,962 --> 00:16:56,930
Ask her to open the trunk.

229
00:16:57,031 --> 00:17:00,114
<i>Come on. I'm working my shit</i>
<i>over here. What are you doing?</i>

230
00:17:00,115 --> 00:17:00,364
Ask her.

231
00:17:03,537 --> 00:17:06,301
I'm gonna need you to pop your trunk.

232
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:10,372
- Gun!
- Shit!

233
00:17:28,796 --> 00:17:32,596
- This just got interesting.
- I got this.

234
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:35,199
10-13! Officer down.
You all right, man?

235
00:17:35,302 --> 00:17:37,202
- Oh, yeah.
- Where'd he get you?

236
00:17:37,304 --> 00:17:39,169
- He shot me in my ass.
- In your ass?

237
00:17:39,273 --> 00:17:42,401
- Shut up.
- Keep pressure on it. Three minutes to E.M.S.

238
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,411
<i>- Hey!</i>
- Hang on!

239
00:17:45,513 --> 00:17:48,676
<i>No, Danny.</i>
<i>I know that look!</i>

240
00:17:48,783 --> 00:17:51,308
<i>You wait for backup.</i>
<i>Don't be a cowboy! Danny!</i>

241
00:17:54,088 --> 00:17:56,648
- There's one on foot.
- Left or right?

242
00:17:56,757 --> 00:17:58,918
- I don't know, baby.
- You watch that side, I'll watch this side.

243
00:18:00,361 --> 00:18:02,886
Pursuit on foot.

244
00:18:02,997 --> 00:18:05,761
Parallel to Duquense.
Suspect's in a gold BMW.

245
00:18:07,968 --> 00:18:09,401
There he is.

246
00:18:16,944 --> 00:18:20,277
- Where do I go? What do I do?
- Left on Saint Claude, right on Montmartre.

247
00:18:20,381 --> 00:18:22,372
We cross the bridge.
We get on the jet.

248
00:18:22,483 --> 00:18:25,111
We never see the New Orleans
Police Department again. I promise.

249
00:18:37,531 --> 00:18:39,362
Police business.

250
00:18:49,092 --> 00:18:51,617
Okay. Keep goin'.

251
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:04,453
Move!

252
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:12,200
Damn!

253
00:19:12,303 --> 00:19:14,237
Down, boy! Down!

254
00:19:28,686 --> 00:19:31,450
Officer Fisher, still on foot pursuit.

255
00:19:31,556 --> 00:19:33,956
Subject's headed towards the marina.

256
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:40,590
It's, like, two blocks to the bridge.
Home free.

257
00:20:12,296 --> 00:20:14,093
<i>Erica!</i>

258
00:20:27,111 --> 00:20:29,136
- Move, move, move!
<i>- Freeze!</i>

259
00:20:29,246 --> 00:20:31,510
- Hands in the air now!
<i>- Miles?</i>

260
00:20:31,616 --> 00:20:34,210
- Now!
<i>- Run!</i>

261
00:20:36,921 --> 00:20:38,616
Erica!

262
00:20:38,723 --> 00:20:41,658
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

263
00:20:41,759 --> 00:20:44,523
<i>Stay in the vehicle.</i>
<i>Stay in the vehicle!</i>

264
00:20:44,629 --> 00:20:46,597
<i>Hands up, now!</i>

265
00:20:50,234 --> 00:20:52,168
- Who are you?
- On the ground!

266
00:20:53,804 --> 00:20:56,568
What's your name?

267
00:20:58,609 --> 00:21:00,839
Officer Fisher.

268
00:21:06,851 --> 00:21:09,979
I'll remember you.

269
00:21:13,991 --> 00:21:15,891
On the ground.

270
00:21:43,584 --> 00:21:46,280
I'm tryin' to figure out what's worse, man-

271
00:21:46,387 --> 00:21:48,446
your shootin' at this table
or your shootin' at the range.

272
00:21:48,556 --> 00:21:51,150
Aw, he's got jokes, huh?
I'll take those, Jesse.

273
00:21:51,258 --> 00:21:54,887
Hey, mama, this might be a little strange,
but Danny wants to know if you think I'm sexy.

274
00:21:54,995 --> 00:21:56,553
<i>Huh?</i>

275
00:21:56,664 --> 00:21:58,894
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. Inquiring minds got to know.

276
00:21:58,999 --> 00:22:01,058
<i>Don't worry about him, darling.</i>

277
00:22:01,168 --> 00:22:04,137
- You're safe. We had him neutered.
- See? Safety first.

278
00:22:04,238 --> 00:22:07,366
Ooh, whoo!

279
00:22:07,475 --> 00:22:09,670
You're an animal.

280
00:22:09,777 --> 00:22:11,677
- Hey, a toast.
- Right on.

281
00:22:11,779 --> 00:22:15,408
To my partner.
One year ago tomorrow, we made detective.

282
00:22:15,516 --> 00:22:18,212
<i>Yeah, and all 'cause</i>
<i>of my outstanding police work, huh?</i>

283
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:20,287
Okay. Maybe it had somethin'
to do with the fact...

284
00:22:20,387 --> 00:22:22,355
that you captured
an international arms dealer.

285
00:22:24,625 --> 00:22:27,685
Hey, but seriously, bro, I mean,
from patrols in the Lower Ninth to this?

286
00:22:27,795 --> 00:22:30,662
- Doesn't ever bother you?
<i>- What?</i>

287
00:22:32,199 --> 00:22:36,226
<i>What- the mandated pay raise,</i>
<i>the flashy new badge?</i>

288
00:22:36,337 --> 00:22:40,000
Benefits of bein' a minor celebrity?
Hell, no!

289
00:22:40,107 --> 00:22:42,632
You just never think about what would
have happened if we had stayed put...

290
00:22:42,743 --> 00:22:44,711
and called for backup that night,
like we were supposed to?

291
00:22:44,812 --> 00:22:48,748
Ah, aside from the fact that I wouldn't
have a bullet hole in my ass cheek?

292
00:22:48,849 --> 00:22:50,840
Yeah, besides that.

293
00:22:50,951 --> 00:22:53,613
No, Danny, not at all. You know what?
Neither should you.

294
00:22:53,721 --> 00:22:56,212
Just sayin'.

295
00:22:56,323 --> 00:22:59,451
A girl dies that night,
and we get promoted.

296
00:23:04,031 --> 00:23:05,931
Can I get a cup?

297
00:23:06,033 --> 00:23:07,933
- That's it?
- I got to.

298
00:23:08,035 --> 00:23:10,731
- Aw, come on. It's fellas' night out. One more.
- We've had like six one mores.

299
00:23:10,838 --> 00:23:15,241
I gotta go home. Why? Because
that beautiful woman, that annoying dog-

300
00:23:15,342 --> 00:23:17,810
you know, they're waitin' for me.

301
00:23:17,912 --> 00:23:21,243
All right, all right.
I can't argue with that, bro.

302
00:23:21,244 --> 00:23:22,076
All right, man.

303
00:23:22,183 --> 00:23:24,083
Good luck.

304
00:23:24,185 --> 00:23:26,449
Aw, come on, son. I don't need luck.
This ain't about luck.

305
00:23:48,676 --> 00:23:51,668
You gotta be kiddin' me.

306
00:23:51,779 --> 00:23:55,613
- This is not a big deal, okay?
- Two inches of water on the floor. Look at Shortie.

307
00:23:55,716 --> 00:23:57,684
I know. Phil's gonna be here
in a few minutes.

308
00:23:57,785 --> 00:24:00,777
That's all I need- put another one
of that guy's kids through college.

309
00:24:00,888 --> 00:24:02,480
This is not a big deal.
This is our home.

310
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:05,252
Apparently our home is made
of durable papier-mâché.

311
00:24:05,253 --> 00:24:05,855
Stop. Stop it.

312
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,485
Look, I have to go to the hospital.
I'm doin' another night shift.

313
00:24:08,596 --> 00:24:11,793
- I'm putting you and Shortie in charge.
- Fantastic.

314
00:24:18,489 --> 00:24:20,252
We're fucked.

315
00:24:23,961 --> 00:24:26,555
I'm gonna start sleepin'
in the guest room.

316
00:24:26,663 --> 00:24:30,292
<i>There's leftover pork chops. Make sure</i>
<i>you feed Phil when he's done savin' our house.</i>

317
00:24:30,401 --> 00:24:32,369
Love you guys.

318
00:24:34,204 --> 00:24:39,574
<i>Dude, didn't I tell you two months ago</i>
<i>that you had to replace the stop valve?</i>

319
00:24:39,676 --> 00:24:42,770
- What stop valve?
<i>- Look, I told you it had a crack.</i>

320
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:45,314
You said you'd take care of it yourself,
save a little cash.

321
00:24:48,252 --> 00:24:51,312
- I spent all afternoon underneath that sink.
- I was gonna get to it.

322
00:24:51,421 --> 00:24:54,049
- When? Two months ago?
- That's when I just bought the new car.

323
00:24:54,158 --> 00:24:57,787
- I was tryin' to save some cash.
- I can't handle this. I- I'm gonna be late.

324
00:24:57,895 --> 00:25:00,295
- Molly?
- Danny, what?

325
00:25:00,397 --> 00:25:02,365
Look, I need a little help here, okay?

326
00:25:02,466 --> 00:25:06,835
First it was the gas bill, and then
the air conditioning, and now the sink?

327
00:25:06,937 --> 00:25:10,134
I mean, I love you.

328
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,643
I just- I need to know that I can trust you
with these things. That's all. Okay?

329
00:25:14,745 --> 00:25:17,077
I'm sorry.

330
00:25:18,515 --> 00:25:20,483
I gotta go.

331
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:24,844
Molly, wait.

332
00:25:24,955 --> 00:25:26,923
Look, I'll see you in the morning, okay?

333
00:25:36,166 --> 00:25:38,691
<i>Dude, sorry.</i>
<i>I didn't mean to make a ruckus.</i>

334
00:25:38,802 --> 00:25:41,669
<i>- But a plumber's gotta plumb.</i>

335
00:25:41,772 --> 00:25:45,105
<i>You want a little advice?</i>

336
00:25:45,209 --> 00:25:47,336
It's the ones that go underneath the sink-

337
00:25:47,444 --> 00:25:49,844
those are the ones that you don't want
to have walk away.

338
00:26:06,196 --> 00:26:08,289
Yeah.

339
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:11,765
Is this Officer Fisher
of the New Orleans Police Department?

340
00:26:13,369 --> 00:26:15,496
Detective Fisher.
Who's calling?

341
00:26:15,605 --> 00:26:18,096
This is Miles Jackson.

342
00:26:18,208 --> 00:26:21,006
- How you been?
- Why the hell are you calling me?

343
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:24,137
Say hello-
chat about the weather...

344
00:26:24,247 --> 00:26:26,215
see if you fancy a quick bite.

345
00:26:26,316 --> 00:26:28,284
Yeah, prison food tastes like shit.

346
00:26:28,384 --> 00:26:31,444
Yes, it does.
One of the many reasons that I left.

347
00:26:33,923 --> 00:26:37,290
I put you there, Miles. I'm pretty sure
I'd know if you were out by now.

348
00:26:37,393 --> 00:26:39,258
Really, Danny?

349
00:26:39,362 --> 00:26:43,822
I'm sorry to tell you, but I think you might
have been left out of the loop on this one.

350
00:26:43,933 --> 00:26:45,901
Okay. So, where are you?

351
00:26:46,002 --> 00:26:51,235
Close enough to smell Molly in the shower
while you were takin' your little nap.

352
00:26:51,341 --> 00:26:55,937
It's a real shame about the plumbin',
'cause I was really startin' to enjoy the show.

353
00:26:59,282 --> 00:27:02,183
<i>- Danny? Where you goin'?</i>

354
00:27:07,423 --> 00:27:09,118
I don't know where you are
or what you're doin'.

355
00:27:09,225 --> 00:27:12,735
You come anywhere near me and Molly,
I swear to God-

356
00:27:12,736 --> 00:27:14,060
Danny, please shut up.

357
00:27:14,164 --> 00:27:16,257
You killed the love of my life.

358
00:27:16,366 --> 00:27:18,960
That was an accident, Miles!

359
00:27:26,643 --> 00:27:28,873
Oh, and poor Phil.

360
00:27:28,978 --> 00:27:31,879
He was really looking forward
to those pork chops.

361
00:27:31,981 --> 00:27:34,313
Phil!

362
00:27:34,417 --> 00:27:36,681
Phil, get out of the house!

363
00:27:53,269 --> 00:27:56,204
Now, see, that was an accident.

364
00:27:58,341 --> 00:28:02,141
Okay, you listen
very carefully to me, Danny.

365
00:28:02,245 --> 00:28:04,145
It's our anniversary.

366
00:28:04,247 --> 00:28:08,741
One year ago today, whether by dumb luck
or uncompromising skill, you bested me.

367
00:28:08,852 --> 00:28:11,821
And as such, today we're going
to have our rematch.

368
00:28:11,921 --> 00:28:13,752
I just took Round 1.

369
00:28:13,857 --> 00:28:18,920
The last time we met, you took from me
what can never, ever be replaced.

370
00:28:19,028 --> 00:28:21,519
And for that, I am going to take from you.

371
00:28:21,631 --> 00:28:26,034
Now I just wonder, do you think Molly
is gonna be able to trust me?

372
00:28:27,237 --> 00:28:29,330
Miles! Miles!

373
00:28:34,010 --> 00:28:36,103
- Keep him safe.
- All right.

374
00:29:02,138 --> 00:29:05,130
Excuse me. Could I just use your phone?
I need to call my daughter.

375
00:29:05,241 --> 00:29:07,106
- Yeah, of course.
- Thank you.

376
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,643
Great.

377
00:29:12,515 --> 00:29:15,746
From her house.

378
00:29:26,229 --> 00:29:28,424
Okay. Um-

379
00:29:41,110 --> 00:29:43,305
Molly!

380
00:29:43,413 --> 00:29:45,313
How about Camille's mom?

381
00:29:48,084 --> 00:29:50,052
Molly!

382
00:30:01,397 --> 00:30:03,365
- Police! Out of the car!
- What?

383
00:30:03,466 --> 00:30:05,434
- Out of the car. Come on.
- Okay.

384
00:30:14,377 --> 00:30:16,504
Hey!

385
00:30:32,462 --> 00:30:34,327
Hey, watch it!

386
00:30:59,655 --> 00:31:02,715
- That's great!
- Yeah, no problem.

387
00:31:10,466 --> 00:31:12,764
- Holla at your boy.
- Hank.

388
00:31:12,869 --> 00:31:15,429
Call D.O.T. Have them stall
the <i>Thomas Jefferson</i> ferry.

389
00:31:15,538 --> 00:31:18,033
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What's going on, Danny? Slow down.

390
00:31:18,034 --> 00:31:18,598
Miles Jackson.

391
00:31:18,708 --> 00:31:22,576
He broke out of prison. If we don't stop
that ferry in the next 30 seconds...

392
00:31:22,678 --> 00:31:26,273
- I'll never see Molly again.
- All right, all right. D.O.T. I'm on it.

393
00:31:35,124 --> 00:31:37,684
Did you get good grades?

394
00:31:39,195 --> 00:31:41,220
Try to get some of your homework done
while you're there.

395
00:32:05,354 --> 00:32:08,152
- Bye-bye. Thank you so much.
- Hey, no problem.

396
00:32:08,257 --> 00:32:10,384
- Sorry it took a little longer.
- No. Don't worry.

397
00:32:33,749 --> 00:32:36,980
<i>Molly. Molly, pick up!</i>

398
00:32:38,588 --> 00:32:41,079
Whoa, whoa! Detective Danny Fisher.
Secure this area now.

399
00:32:43,392 --> 00:32:45,792
Ladies and gentlemen, hold it!
Stop for a minute.

400
00:32:49,031 --> 00:32:52,762
Danny.

401
00:32:52,869 --> 00:32:53,335
Where is she?

402
00:32:53,336 --> 00:32:55,235
She's gone. She just gets
on the ferry and she's gone.

403
00:32:55,338 --> 00:32:58,034
Hey, hey. Calm down. Maybe she's just on
the streetcar on the way to the hospital.

404
00:32:58,141 --> 00:33:00,041
No, no, no, no.
You don't understand.

405
00:33:00,143 --> 00:33:02,634
He said I took from him what could
never be replaced. He's gonna kill her.

406
00:33:02,745 --> 00:33:05,077
Hey, Danny.
Danny, that's not gonna happen, okay?

407
00:33:05,181 --> 00:33:07,911
- We're gonna find her. We're gonna get her back.
- Molly, come on. Pick up.

408
00:33:08,017 --> 00:33:09,109
Pick up!

409
00:33:10,586 --> 00:33:13,453
Molly Porter's phone.

410
00:33:13,556 --> 00:33:16,491
Let me talk to her.

411
00:33:16,592 --> 00:33:19,220
How do you know she's not dead already?

412
00:33:19,328 --> 00:33:20,727
I'm just teasing, Danny.

413
00:33:20,830 --> 00:33:24,527
Come on. Come on.
Where's your sense of humor?

414
00:33:29,138 --> 00:33:31,868
- Here. Say hello to your boyfriend.
- Danny, please.

415
00:33:31,974 --> 00:33:34,499
<i>- We're in a silver va-</i>
- Molly! Molly, where are you?

416
00:33:34,610 --> 00:33:37,078
That one was for free.

417
00:33:37,180 --> 00:33:39,148
<i>The rest you'll have to earn.</i>

418
00:33:39,248 --> 00:33:41,182
I'm gonna find you.

419
00:33:41,284 --> 00:33:43,844
I'm gonna hunt you down,
and I'm gonna kill you.

420
00:33:43,953 --> 00:33:46,217
<i>Well, you know what?</i>
<i>I look forward to that, Danny.</i>

421
00:33:46,322 --> 00:33:49,519
It's a game.
What, you like games, don't you?

422
00:33:49,625 --> 00:33:53,026
Mousetrap, Monopoly, naked Twister.

423
00:33:53,129 --> 00:33:55,188
This one's called 12 Rounds.

424
00:33:55,298 --> 00:33:59,166
<i>Round 1- I took your house.</i>
<i>Round 2- I took Molly.</i>

425
00:33:59,268 --> 00:34:02,999
The only way to keep her alive-
you do exactly what I say when I say it.

426
00:34:03,105 --> 00:34:07,565
<i>If you're still standing after all 12 rounds,</i>
<i>well, then you'll have won her back.</i>

427
00:34:07,677 --> 00:34:11,010
You gotta be kidding me. You can't expect me
to believe that you're gonna keep-

428
00:34:11,113 --> 00:34:13,411
Well-You'll believe
what I tell you to believe, Danny.

429
00:34:13,516 --> 00:34:14,778
<i>I don't think you've got much choice.</i>

430
00:34:15,384 --> 00:34:17,181
<i>Okay. Round 3.</i>

431
00:34:17,286 --> 00:34:20,949
In 15 minutes I will be calling
a particular cell phone in the city.

432
00:34:21,057 --> 00:34:25,756
Why don't you return to where we first met,
see if you can pick up my scent once again?

433
00:34:29,065 --> 00:34:31,260
Okay, uh, Molly said she
was in a silver van, okay?

434
00:34:31,367 --> 00:34:33,301
They can't be more
than six blocks from here.

435
00:34:33,402 --> 00:34:35,734
- Put out an A.P.B., get a trace on Molly's cell.
- Okay.

436
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,720
<i>... your name?</i>

437
00:35:00,830 --> 00:35:02,764
<i>Officer Fisher.</i>

438
00:35:06,269 --> 00:35:09,500
<i>I don't see anything.</i>

439
00:35:09,605 --> 00:35:12,597
<i>I don't know.</i>
<i>Maybe we're in the wrong place.</i>

440
00:35:12,708 --> 00:35:15,142
No. This is where we stopped the car.
This is where it started.

441
00:35:15,244 --> 00:35:18,475
And this is where he shot me in the ass.
But I don't see anything.

442
00:35:18,581 --> 00:35:21,516
- How much time?
- Uh, we got 10 minutes.

443
00:35:21,617 --> 00:35:25,576
<i>I definitely think we're</i>
<i>in the wrong place, Danny.</i>

444
00:35:25,688 --> 00:35:29,920
<i>No, wait. I could be wrong.</i>
<i>That's- That's not from Katrina.</i>

445
00:35:30,026 --> 00:35:32,620
- That's today's date.
<i>- You're right.</i>

446
00:35:32,728 --> 00:35:35,288
That's a code. Uh-

447
00:35:35,398 --> 00:35:37,628
We got degrees.
We got clocks.

448
00:35:37,733 --> 00:35:40,031
Yeah, those aren't real clocks though.
There's-There's no hours.

449
00:35:40,136 --> 00:35:41,164
Uh, countdown?

450
00:35:41,165 --> 00:35:44,835
No, no, no. It's just, uh,
two degrees, two clocks.

451
00:35:45,941 --> 00:35:49,775
Degrees, minutes, seconds.

452
00:35:49,879 --> 00:35:51,779
"X."

453
00:35:51,881 --> 00:35:55,282
Longitude and latitude. That's a location.
That's where we're gonna find the phone.

454
00:35:55,384 --> 00:35:57,944
Longitude and latitude. How the hell
do you know about this stuff, Danny?

455
00:35:58,054 --> 00:36:00,113
Eighth-grade geography, brother. Let's go.

456
00:36:00,222 --> 00:36:03,385
Okay, read 'em back to me.

457
00:36:03,492 --> 00:36:07,189
No, no, no, no. Twenty-nine degrees,
57 minutes, three seconds.

458
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,959
Yeah. Got it.
317 Decatur.

459
00:36:10,066 --> 00:36:12,694
317 Decatur?
That's my brother's firehouse.

460
00:36:18,941 --> 00:36:22,536
Ooh-hoo-hoo!

461
00:36:22,645 --> 00:36:24,613
<i>All right. Who's up?</i>

462
00:36:24,714 --> 00:36:27,581
Hey, bro. We're doing an all-day Ping-Pong
tourney. Why don't you come on down?

463
00:36:27,683 --> 00:36:30,413
- You at the station?
- Why are you shouting?

464
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:33,852
Get everybody out. There may be a bomb
in the house. I'll be there in two minutes.

465
00:36:36,659 --> 00:36:38,752
<i>Movin' out now.</i>

466
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,835
I need the computers patched.
I need a full phone bank.

467
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,167
<i>Yeah, they're clear upstairs.</i>

468
00:36:55,277 --> 00:36:58,075
- Everybody out?
- Yeah.

469
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:00,705
Danny, you really think this guy
put a bomb in the firehouse?

470
00:37:00,816 --> 00:37:03,876
This guy blew up my house. He took Molly.
I have no idea what he's gonna do next.

471
00:37:03,986 --> 00:37:04,542
Fifteen seconds.

472
00:37:04,543 --> 00:37:06,420
He said he was gonna call a
particular cell phone here.

473
00:37:06,522 --> 00:37:08,752
<i>Everybody, cell phones out.</i>

474
00:37:11,293 --> 00:37:15,753
<i>Five, four, three, two, one.</i>

475
00:37:22,905 --> 00:37:25,738
You hear that?
It's right there. It's right there.

476
00:37:28,677 --> 00:37:30,440
<i>- Can I help you?</i>

477
00:37:30,546 --> 00:37:32,776
Hey, Jansen.
Give me a second.

478
00:37:32,882 --> 00:37:36,079
- Hello?
Look at that, Danny. Right on time.

479
00:37:36,185 --> 00:37:39,279
You've just earned yourself
extra minutes on the next task.

480
00:37:39,522 --> 00:37:43,253
<i>Go. I'm on three.</i>

481
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:47,159
<i>And speak of the devil,</i>
<i>there's the bell for Round 4.</i>

482
00:37:47,263 --> 00:37:51,222
There's a fire
in the Orleans Savings and Loan.

483
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:54,564
<i>In the memory chip</i>
<i>of the phone you're holding...</i>

484
00:37:54,670 --> 00:37:58,106
<i>are the numbers of two security deposit boxes</i>
<i>located on the 10th floor.</i>

485
00:37:58,207 --> 00:38:02,007
<i>To win, simply grab those boxes...</i>

486
00:38:02,111 --> 00:38:04,602
by 5:55 exactly...

487
00:38:04,713 --> 00:38:08,809
or there's gonna be an early knockout.

488
00:38:08,918 --> 00:38:11,182
You gotta be shittin' me.

489
00:38:11,287 --> 00:38:13,847
Uh, not enough time.
I'm just gonna come in.

490
00:38:13,956 --> 00:38:17,517
<i>Yeah. I'll be right there.</i>

491
00:38:17,626 --> 00:38:19,992
Hey, hey. Tel-com is up on your phone.

492
00:38:20,095 --> 00:38:22,723
They just think they found the van
that Miles used to take Molly.

493
00:38:22,832 --> 00:38:25,733
I'm gonna go back and set up a war room,
all right? You okay?

494
00:38:31,974 --> 00:38:35,671
<i>Hey, hey.</i>
<i>Hey, hey, hey! Focus.</i>

495
00:38:35,778 --> 00:38:38,212
Molly needs you to focus.
All right?

496
00:38:38,314 --> 00:38:40,976
We gotta do this.
You gotta help me find her.

497
00:38:42,952 --> 00:38:45,716
When have I ever
let you down before? Huh?

498
00:38:45,821 --> 00:38:47,721
You're right.

499
00:38:47,823 --> 00:38:50,223
All right?
Go get this done.

500
00:39:01,270 --> 00:39:03,636
- Detective Fisher?
- Yeah.

501
00:39:03,739 --> 00:39:05,707
Ray Santiago, F.B.I.
This is Inspector George Aiken.

502
00:39:05,808 --> 00:39:08,538
We understand that Miles Jackson's
resurfaced in the area.

503
00:39:08,644 --> 00:39:10,703
- What'd you just say?
- Miles Jackson.

504
00:39:10,813 --> 00:39:12,804
- We heard he tried to contact you-
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

505
00:39:12,915 --> 00:39:15,884
The guy breaks out of prison,
F.B.I. knows about it, and nobody tells me?

506
00:39:15,985 --> 00:39:18,419
- We understand that you're upset, Danny-
- It was none of your business.

507
00:39:18,521 --> 00:39:20,921
You can keep on crying about
what you did and didn't know...

508
00:39:21,023 --> 00:39:24,982
or you can tell us everything that happened
this morning since you woke up.

509
00:39:25,094 --> 00:39:27,927
That is, if you want your girl back.

510
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:31,659
<i>- Engine two, let's move out.</i>
- Danny, you catching a ride?

511
00:39:31,767 --> 00:39:33,735
We're your best chance, Danny.

512
00:39:33,836 --> 00:39:37,328
Tell us what we wanna know,
we'll tell you what you wanna know.

513
00:39:37,439 --> 00:39:42,103
You better talk as fast as they drive.

514
00:39:55,858 --> 00:39:57,723
There was a prison break
in Florida two weeks ago.

515
00:39:57,826 --> 00:40:00,056
<i>Miles and the inmates took the guards,</i>
<i>killed the warden...</i>

516
00:40:00,162 --> 00:40:02,289
and demanded 30 cars
to drive out of the prison.

517
00:40:02,398 --> 00:40:05,765
- And you gave them to them?
- Wasn't exactly our choice, Danny.

518
00:40:05,868 --> 00:40:08,803
<i>The bureau gave them cars</i>
<i>with kill switches and remote door locks.</i>

519
00:40:08,904 --> 00:40:11,270
<i>The inmates get three blocks away from the yard,</i>
<i>National Guard comes in...</i>

520
00:40:11,373 --> 00:40:13,568
puts everyone back in their cells.

521
00:40:13,676 --> 00:40:16,702
- Everyone except Miles.
- Would you please just shut up?

522
00:40:16,812 --> 00:40:18,905
You're killing me with the whining.

523
00:40:19,014 --> 00:40:21,073
<i>You have no idea</i>
<i>what you're up against, do you?</i>

524
00:40:21,183 --> 00:40:23,117
I know you "arrested" him,
but you still don't know.

525
00:40:23,218 --> 00:40:25,880
<i>The fact Miles Jackson</i>
<i>has your girlfriend-</i>

526
00:40:25,988 --> 00:40:27,888
mmm, that interests me very little.

527
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:30,720
<i>The fact that he's done something</i>
<i>that he never does...</i>

528
00:40:30,826 --> 00:40:33,624
the fact that he's
shown himself in the city-

529
00:40:33,729 --> 00:40:36,061
that interests me quite a bit more.

530
00:40:36,165 --> 00:40:39,066
You wanna catch Miles?
That's fine.

531
00:40:39,168 --> 00:40:41,728
I wanna keep Molly alive,
and I know what I gotta do.

532
00:40:46,275 --> 00:40:49,403
Just stay the hell out of my way.

533
00:40:53,015 --> 00:40:55,415
I guess he didn't hear me
about the whining.

534
00:40:55,517 --> 00:40:57,178
Sir, this is exactly what Miles wants.

535
00:40:57,286 --> 00:40:59,846
<i>We should stop Danny</i>
<i>before somebody gets hurt.</i>

536
00:40:59,955 --> 00:41:02,822
Danny? What, are you best friends now?

537
00:41:02,925 --> 00:41:05,120
<i>If Danny keeps playing the game,</i>
<i>Miles is distracted.</i>

538
00:41:05,227 --> 00:41:09,391
Miles is distracted,
he might make a mistake-

539
00:41:09,498 --> 00:41:11,466
and I'll bury him.

540
00:41:12,635 --> 00:41:14,500
Come on!

541
00:41:14,603 --> 00:41:16,662
- Dave.
- Danny.

542
00:41:16,772 --> 00:41:20,139
<i>- How much time?</i>
- Six minutes.

543
00:41:22,811 --> 00:41:25,177
<i>Let's go!
Let's head up the south stairwell.</i>

544
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,805
Smoke on 10, guys.
Come on. Let's go! Let's go!

545
00:41:32,821 --> 00:41:35,847
Let's go.
Let's get a line up there.

546
00:41:37,092 --> 00:41:40,357
Let's go!
Keep moving! Keep moving.

547
00:41:40,462 --> 00:41:42,362
<i>The guys are going up the stairwell now!</i>

548
00:41:42,464 --> 00:41:45,399
<i>Come on, guys.</i>
<i>Let's move it!</i>

549
00:41:54,009 --> 00:41:55,670
Listen up!

550
00:41:55,778 --> 00:41:58,542
Listen up.
I need everybody.

551
00:41:58,647 --> 00:42:02,981
All right. Thirty-two minutes ago,
Molly Porter was taken from the Canal Street ferry.

552
00:42:03,085 --> 00:42:07,021
We need every security camera, every
possible witness, every vehicle plate number.

553
00:42:08,657 --> 00:42:11,182
This asshole calls again,
I wanna know where he is.

554
00:42:11,293 --> 00:42:13,989
<i>I wanna know what he's doing.</i>
<i>I wanna find him before he so much as thinks...</i>

555
00:42:14,096 --> 00:42:16,030
about touching one hair on her head.

556
00:42:16,131 --> 00:42:19,430
This could be your girlfriend,
could be your wife.

557
00:42:19,535 --> 00:42:22,003
Could be any one of us.

558
00:42:22,104 --> 00:42:25,665
All right.
This asshole cannot win.

559
00:42:37,786 --> 00:42:40,516
<i>- We got some spare air bottles?</i>

560
00:42:47,696 --> 00:42:51,188
<i>All right.</i>
<i>Clear that backroom!</i>

561
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:53,461
- Dave!
- Yeah.

562
00:42:55,137 --> 00:42:57,367
Watch yourself.

563
00:43:03,712 --> 00:43:06,010
How much time?

564
00:43:06,115 --> 00:43:08,242
Two minutes.

565
00:43:10,853 --> 00:43:13,413
Hold this.

566
00:43:16,492 --> 00:43:18,221
<i>It's 590. 591.</i>

567
00:43:18,327 --> 00:43:20,761
Right there.

568
00:43:34,743 --> 00:43:36,734
Danny.

569
00:43:44,887 --> 00:43:47,412
Surprise!

570
00:43:47,523 --> 00:43:50,686
Sometimes victory is not
all it's cracked up to be.

571
00:43:50,793 --> 00:43:53,455
Eh, Danny? Round 5!

572
00:43:53,562 --> 00:43:57,464
<i>Two pounds of explosives</i>
<i>packed inside one of these boxes.</i>

573
00:43:57,566 --> 00:44:01,332
You now have less than seven minutes
to cross the 23 city blocks...

574
00:44:01,436 --> 00:44:03,836
between here
and the Nicholls Street Wharf.

575
00:44:03,939 --> 00:44:06,032
<i>Arrive at the wharfany later,</i>
<i>the bomb goes off.</i>

576
00:44:06,141 --> 00:44:09,338
<i>The other box contains</i>
<i>the clue to the next round.</i>

577
00:44:09,444 --> 00:44:12,845
<i>See, in your time constraints,</i>
<i>you might wanna use the fire truck for this one.</i>

578
00:44:12,948 --> 00:44:17,044
<i>Oh, yeah. And don't forget</i>
<i>to wear the hat and use the siren.</i>

579
00:44:18,821 --> 00:44:20,618
Seven minutes?

580
00:44:20,722 --> 00:44:23,282
We won't even be out of the building
in seven minutes.

581
00:44:23,392 --> 00:44:25,360
That's if we take the stairs.

582
00:44:26,628 --> 00:44:29,722
<i>Danny!</i>

583
00:44:31,667 --> 00:44:34,363
<i>Ten is clear! Repeat, no fire!</i>

584
00:44:34,469 --> 00:44:37,802
<i>Just a bunch of smoke bombs!</i>

585
00:44:39,842 --> 00:44:41,673
What are you doing?

586
00:44:41,777 --> 00:44:43,802
<i>Get them all out of the building!</i>

587
00:44:43,912 --> 00:44:47,348
You got gloves?
Give them here.

588
00:44:50,018 --> 00:44:53,476
When you get out of here, you get to Atlanta,
you find Mom and you stay with her.

589
00:44:53,589 --> 00:44:56,422
Make sure she's safe.
I don't want this guy havin' another chance.

590
00:44:56,525 --> 00:44:59,323
- Anchor this down.
- Danny-

591
00:44:59,428 --> 00:45:01,555
Anchor it down!

592
00:45:03,832 --> 00:45:06,323
Danny, you can't do this!

593
00:45:19,681 --> 00:45:22,115
Oh, shoot!
Do you see that man?

594
00:45:24,553 --> 00:45:27,454
<i>Folks, I'm gonna ask
you to back up, please.</i>

595
00:45:47,709 --> 00:45:49,802
<i>You got triage ready to go?</i>

596
00:45:51,813 --> 00:45:54,907
Danny!

597
00:45:57,052 --> 00:46:00,783
<i>Everybody accounted for?</i>
<i>Have 'em all respond on tac channel two.</i>

598
00:46:00,889 --> 00:46:02,789
<i>They're moving out now!</i>

599
00:46:09,831 --> 00:46:13,096
Hey, what are you doing?
Look out!

600
00:46:13,201 --> 00:46:16,762
<i>You, out of the truck now!</i>

601
00:46:16,872 --> 00:46:19,773
<i>- Hey, what are you doin'?</i>

602
00:46:42,864 --> 00:46:44,525
<i>Did you get the trace?</i>

603
00:46:44,633 --> 00:46:47,830
<i>No, he's using an encrypted signal.</i>
<i>We can't even pull a number to start a trace.</i>

604
00:46:47,936 --> 00:46:50,336
What's that sound, Danny?

605
00:46:50,439 --> 00:46:54,466
- I'm driving a fire truck.
- Are you sure that's such a good idea right now?

606
00:46:54,576 --> 00:46:55,804
Oh!

607
00:47:06,221 --> 00:47:10,954
Call the bomb squad!
Get them to Nicholls Street Wharf! I gotta go!

608
00:47:13,717 --> 00:47:14,979
Stay with him.

609
00:47:22,692 --> 00:47:24,956
Hey! Look out!

610
00:48:18,637 --> 00:48:21,333
No, no, no!
What are you doin'?

611
00:48:29,815 --> 00:48:31,248
Yo, hey! Hey! Chill!

612
00:48:37,489 --> 00:48:38,956
Sorry!

613
00:49:17,928 --> 00:49:21,261
Shut down the timers, Miles. I'm here.

614
00:49:21,365 --> 00:49:26,234
<i>Well done, Danny, but I'm sorry to say,</i>
<i>you seem to be a bit late to the party.</i>

615
00:49:47,822 --> 00:49:51,656
It was the bell. The bell signals
the start of the next round.

616
00:49:51,759 --> 00:49:54,660
Oh, you're finally starting
to get the hang of this.

617
00:49:54,762 --> 00:49:56,753
I wanna speak to Molly.

618
00:49:56,865 --> 00:50:00,460
How about I do you one better?
How about I show her to you?

619
00:50:00,568 --> 00:50:04,470
<i>As I said, the clue to the next round</i>
<i>is in the box you so deftly hung on to.</i>

620
00:50:04,572 --> 00:50:06,699
<i>You put two and two together...</i>

621
00:50:06,808 --> 00:50:09,606
you might have quite the reunion.

622
00:50:10,812 --> 00:50:13,542
Tell me you didn't kill anybody
with that thing.

623
00:50:19,954 --> 00:50:21,854
I need a saw.

624
00:50:28,396 --> 00:50:31,832
<i> All right. Let's drain this thing</i>
<i>and get it back to the yard.</i>

625
00:50:37,238 --> 00:50:39,706
It's clear.

626
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:45,870
- Thought you guys were gonna catch him.
- We switched out your SIM card.

627
00:50:45,980 --> 00:50:48,881
We're tapped into your phone.
We can track you wherever you go.

628
00:50:48,983 --> 00:50:52,419
Miles will call again, Danny. When he does,
keep him on the line for 30 seconds.

629
00:50:52,520 --> 00:50:55,182
- That's all we need.
- Miles's phone's encrypted. You can't trace it.

630
00:50:55,290 --> 00:50:57,258
That's funny.
We're the F.B.I., not Mayberry P.D.

631
00:50:57,358 --> 00:50:59,417
All we need is 30 seconds.

632
00:50:59,527 --> 00:51:03,691
All teams, listen up, listen up!
We have a location.

633
00:51:03,798 --> 00:51:07,529
<i>It's the Hotel Monteleone.</i>
<i>I repeat. It's the Hotel Monteleone.</i>

634
00:51:07,635 --> 00:51:12,004
I need SWAT, and I need K-9,
and I need all of you there. Now!

635
00:51:19,614 --> 00:51:22,913
<i>Get the elevators shut down.</i>
<i>Secure the street. K-9 unit inside.</i>

636
00:51:23,017 --> 00:51:26,043
- Get against the wall.
- Down! Everybody down!

637
00:51:29,524 --> 00:51:32,288
Blue team, seal all the exits.
I need snipers on the roof.

638
00:51:32,393 --> 00:51:35,794
Shut down all communication in and out
of the building, and start with the dogs.

639
00:51:35,897 --> 00:51:39,799
Ray, pull the tapes.
I need to know what room this key is for.

640
00:51:39,901 --> 00:51:41,664
<i>- Where's your control room?</i>
<i>- Right this way.</i>

641
00:51:41,769 --> 00:51:43,066
<i>Thank you.</i>

642
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:46,904
It's clean.

643
00:51:54,515 --> 00:51:57,814
- Clear!
- Clear. Fisher!

644
00:52:24,812 --> 00:52:27,246
<i>Fisher.</i>

645
00:52:33,721 --> 00:52:36,519
Come on, come on, come on.
Where are you?

646
00:52:38,459 --> 00:52:40,620
- He was here.
- I got nothing.

647
00:52:40,728 --> 00:52:43,196
- Ray, get the teams ready to act.
- All right.

648
00:52:48,635 --> 00:52:51,229
That's it. That's Miles.
Stop it right there.

649
00:52:51,338 --> 00:52:54,603
- What time was this?
- It was, like, 30 minutes ago.

650
00:52:54,708 --> 00:52:58,269
- He's writing something down.
- It's a sign.

651
00:52:58,378 --> 00:53:00,312
What's it say?

652
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:05,345
"We're still here."

653
00:53:07,521 --> 00:53:10,649
All the exits are locked down.

654
00:53:10,758 --> 00:53:13,693
All right. We just found Miles on camera.
Stand by for location.

655
00:53:13,794 --> 00:53:16,888
Yeah, hold on. He's, uh-
He's talking to somebody.

656
00:53:16,997 --> 00:53:19,659
- They're leading him somewhere.
- Who is that?

657
00:53:21,335 --> 00:53:23,235
It's Willie.

658
00:53:26,373 --> 00:53:30,833
- I'm gonna go find Willie.
- Show me everything. I need a location.

659
00:53:30,944 --> 00:53:34,471
So, Miles rented the S.U.V. last week
in Lafayette, left a dummy address.

660
00:53:34,581 --> 00:53:38,347
We're tracking the I.D. on the security deposit
boxes and known accomplices, but so far nothing.

661
00:53:38,452 --> 00:53:41,944
What are we missing? This guy doesn't
plan everything and not leave a trail.

662
00:53:42,055 --> 00:53:44,615
- Let's go over the prison break again.
- All right.

663
00:53:44,725 --> 00:53:46,625
<i>Miles and the boys take the yard.</i>

664
00:53:46,727 --> 00:53:48,285
But Miles is the only one who escapes.

665
00:53:48,395 --> 00:53:51,125
How many of these guys got into cars,
but wound up back in their cells?

666
00:53:51,231 --> 00:53:53,222
Forty-three.
But the F.B.I. already talked to 'em all.

667
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:56,461
- Get me the warden on the phone.
- You got it.

668
00:53:56,653 --> 00:53:58,985
He gave Miles the access code
to the security elevator.

669
00:53:59,088 --> 00:54:01,488
It goes all the way to the basement.
I'll meet you there.

670
00:54:03,026 --> 00:54:05,392
Hey, sorry if I did
something wrong before.

671
00:54:05,495 --> 00:54:07,554
This guy, he had all the right papers.

672
00:54:07,664 --> 00:54:09,689
Said he was here to service
the air-conditioning.

673
00:54:09,799 --> 00:54:11,767
It's okay. You didn't know.

674
00:54:11,868 --> 00:54:14,359
- This thing still works?
- One of the oldest in the city.

675
00:54:28,985 --> 00:54:32,546
<i>I led him this far. Said he'd go</i>
<i>the rest of the way on his own.</i>

676
00:54:32,655 --> 00:54:36,091
Wait. Those air-conditioning ducts-
they go straight to the top?

677
00:54:36,192 --> 00:54:38,854
- Yeah. They vent out to the roof.
<i>- Take me there.</i>

678
00:54:53,276 --> 00:54:56,404
- Sir, we're clear. There's no sign of Miles.
- So where's Fisher?

679
00:55:17,133 --> 00:55:19,693
- Tell me that's normal.
- Uh-

680
00:55:24,373 --> 00:55:27,240
- No service.
- Well-

681
00:55:27,343 --> 00:55:29,743
- What's this for?
- There's supposed to be a phone there, right?

682
00:55:29,846 --> 00:55:31,541
Yeah, but-

683
00:55:34,283 --> 00:55:37,116
Told ya I'd show her to you, Danny.

684
00:55:39,021 --> 00:55:40,955
"Danny.

685
00:55:41,057 --> 00:55:46,461
"If you're viewing this,
Round 6 has already started.

686
00:55:46,562 --> 00:55:48,496
"I'm sure you've met
your new friend, Willie.

687
00:55:48,598 --> 00:55:51,829
"Sorry, Willie.
Nothing personal-

688
00:55:51,934 --> 00:55:54,129
"just the wrong place at the wrong time.

689
00:55:55,438 --> 00:55:57,531
<i>"At the conclusion of this message-</i>

690
00:55:59,475 --> 00:56:02,308
"you'll have 60 seconds...

691
00:56:02,411 --> 00:56:05,471
"before the elevator
free-falls to the ground.

692
00:56:07,717 --> 00:56:09,617
"With 60 seconds, limited resources...

693
00:56:09,719 --> 00:56:11,653
<i>"and Willie's unfortunate girth...</i>

694
00:56:11,754 --> 00:56:16,191
"there's only time

695

<i>"Who lives and who dies-</i>

696
00:56:19,862 --> 00:56:25,528
"For the lucky, the clue to Round 7
is framed in the lobby.

697
00:56:25,635 --> 00:56:27,865
For the other,
at least you'll be a lot thinner."

698
00:56:27,970 --> 00:56:30,165
Danny, he made me read this to you.

699
00:56:30,273 --> 00:56:32,434
<i>Is that for real, man?</i>

700
00:56:32,542 --> 00:56:34,510
- I can't die. I got a wife and kids.
- Where's the security hatch?

701
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:37,135
- I got a radio.
- There's no time. How do I open this thing?

702
00:56:37,246 --> 00:56:39,976
- You gonna leave me here?
- No. Watch the clock.

703
00:56:40,082 --> 00:56:42,312
<i>- The latch! On top! Look for the latch.</i>
- I got it.

704
00:56:44,253 --> 00:56:46,847
Stay right there.
I'll get you out.

705
00:56:46,956 --> 00:56:49,390
Shit, I can't fit through there.

706
00:56:49,492 --> 00:56:51,722
- All right, big man, let's go.
- I can't. It's too far.

707
00:56:51,828 --> 00:56:54,023
<i>You gotta pull. It's your only hope.</i>
<i>Give me your hand.</i>

708
00:56:54,130 --> 00:56:56,030
Come on. Let's go. Up!

709
00:56:56,132 --> 00:56:58,999
- Come on. You can reach.
- It's too far, man.

710
00:56:59,101 --> 00:57:01,331
Come on. You can make it.

711
00:57:01,437 --> 00:57:03,905
<i>- Pull!</i>

712
00:57:07,410 --> 00:57:09,207
<i>Willie, come on!</i>
<i>Come on!</i>

713
00:57:09,312 --> 00:57:11,246
<i>You gotta get up, buddy.</i>
<i>Come on.</i>

714
00:57:11,347 --> 00:57:13,315
- How much time?
- Less than 40 seconds!

715
00:57:13,416 --> 00:57:16,180
That means we need to work together.
Come on, buddy.

716
00:57:16,285 --> 00:57:19,345
- Don't let go! Don't let go!
- I got you! I got you!

717
00:57:19,455 --> 00:57:24,358
Pull, Danny!

718
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:28,897
I don't wanna die.

719
00:57:28,998 --> 00:57:32,832
<i>- Come on!</i>
- Don't let go!

720
00:57:32,935 --> 00:57:35,904
You're almost there.

721
00:57:36,005 --> 00:57:38,701
Made it!

722
00:57:38,808 --> 00:57:41,436
I can't believe I made it.

723
00:57:41,544 --> 00:57:43,739
Oh! My back!
I can't move.

724
00:57:43,846 --> 00:57:46,007
Willie, the elevator's gonna fall.
I need your hand.

725
00:57:46,115 --> 00:57:48,049
<i>You gotta get on the ledge.</i>
<i>I need you on the ledge.</i>

726
00:57:48,150 --> 00:57:51,085
<i>I can't! I can't!</i>
<i>My back!</i>

727
00:57:51,187 --> 00:57:53,553
<i>- You can make it!</i>
<i>- I got it!</i>

728
00:57:55,324 --> 00:57:58,782
Willie!

729
00:58:28,991 --> 00:58:31,425
<i> All teams, commence</i>
<i>evacuation of three-city-block radius.</i>

730
00:58:31,527 --> 00:58:34,963
- Let's go. Keep moving.
<i>- High-pressure gas leak in hotel.</i>

731
00:58:35,064 --> 00:58:39,262
<i>All teams, reposition to clear</i>
<i>three-city-block radius.</i>

732
00:58:39,368 --> 00:58:42,269
<i>Clear the area!
Evacuate the mint!</i>

733
00:58:42,371 --> 00:58:45,169
<i>Go! Move!</i>

734
00:58:45,274 --> 00:58:49,574
<i>All battalions, evacuate the area.
Staging "B."</i>

735
00:58:49,679 --> 00:58:52,079
<i>Okay, Captain.</i>

736
00:58:54,183 --> 00:58:56,174
<i>That's affirmative.</i>

737
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,150
People, back! Back!

738
00:59:12,234 --> 00:59:14,532
<i>I can't die.
I've got a wife and kids.</i>

739
00:59:20,376 --> 00:59:21,775
<i>You did everything you could.</i>

740
00:59:22,912 --> 00:59:26,746
Danny. Miles didn't give you enough time.

741
00:59:26,849 --> 00:59:29,215
<i>Hold it. Hold it.
Get me Terry.</i>

742
00:59:29,318 --> 00:59:32,481
Somebody bring me Terry.
Come on. Set it up.

743
00:59:32,588 --> 00:59:34,954
All right.

744
00:59:37,927 --> 00:59:39,895
Thirty seconds.

745
00:59:42,465 --> 00:59:45,628
- Yeah?
- Danny, you sound upset.

746
00:59:45,735 --> 00:59:47,327
<i>I did everything you asked, Miles.</i>

747
00:59:47,436 --> 00:59:49,336
You had no reason to kill him.

748
00:59:49,438 --> 00:59:52,532
I didn't, Danny.
You had the choice to save him.

749
00:59:52,641 --> 00:59:55,667
- It was your round to win.
- Bullshit!

750
00:59:55,778 --> 00:59:57,746
Screw your choices!
Screw your rounds!

751
00:59:57,847 --> 01:00:00,611
Are you givin' up on me?
'Cause if you wanna stop playin'...

752
01:00:00,716 --> 01:00:03,651
<i>I'm sure other arrangements can be made.</i>

753
01:00:03,753 --> 01:00:07,280
- No.
- All right. So, as Molly said...

754
01:00:07,390 --> 01:00:09,824
- the clue to the next round-
- Molly said nothing!

755
01:00:09,925 --> 01:00:13,725
I just watched a man die,
and I don't even know if Molly's still alive.

756
01:00:13,829 --> 01:00:15,694
Excuse me?

757
01:00:15,798 --> 01:00:17,925
<i>Keep him on.</i>

758
01:00:18,034 --> 01:00:19,934
<i>I need a minute to figure this out.</i>

759
01:00:20,036 --> 01:00:22,231
<i>There's nothin' to figure, Danny.</i>

760
01:00:23,939 --> 01:00:26,066
Is the F.B.I. tryin' to trace this call?

761
01:00:26,175 --> 01:00:28,268
<i>Tsk, tsk, tsk.</i>
<i>Let me guess.</i>

762
01:00:28,377 --> 01:00:32,336
First it was your friends in the police department
who realized the cell was encrypted.

763
01:00:32,448 --> 01:00:34,814
Then it was the F.B.I. -

764
01:00:34,917 --> 01:00:38,478
George Aiken
and all his wonderful little toys?

765
01:00:38,587 --> 01:00:40,919
Hold for position.
Everybody hold for position.

766
01:00:41,023 --> 01:00:45,289
I must say, I really am touched...

767
01:00:45,394 --> 01:00:47,919
how you've all come together
for this little affair.

768
01:00:50,166 --> 01:00:53,761
Not enough time.

769
01:01:02,945 --> 01:01:06,642
- Yeah.
- So why don't we start over again...

770
01:01:06,749 --> 01:01:08,740
see if it's that much fun
the second time around.

771
01:01:08,851 --> 01:01:11,376
<i>Or maybe-</i>

772
01:01:25,668 --> 01:01:27,761
- Yeah.
- Third time lucky?

773
01:01:27,870 --> 01:01:33,502
So, as Molly said before, the clue
to the next round is framed in the lobby-

774
01:01:33,609 --> 01:01:37,807
a picture of a lonely man, which is how
you'll end up if you don't play nice.

775
01:01:37,913 --> 01:01:42,009
You try and trace my call again,
I am gonna start cutting Molly's toes off.

776
01:01:42,118 --> 01:01:45,986
So, how about I call you again
in two minutes?

777
01:01:46,088 --> 01:01:49,148
<i>Would that give you ample time to grieve?</i>

778
01:01:50,559 --> 01:01:52,527
We lost the signal.

779
01:02:00,035 --> 01:02:02,003
Miles says hello.

780
01:02:03,439 --> 01:02:05,430
<i>This isn't working.</i>

781
01:02:05,541 --> 01:02:08,135
Before today, the feds
have been up on Miles's cell phone...

782
01:02:08,244 --> 01:02:10,144
a grand total of one time.

783
01:02:10,246 --> 01:02:12,146
It's working just fine.

784
01:02:12,248 --> 01:02:15,411
If Danny keeps doing this,
a lot more people are gonna get hurt.

785
01:02:53,856 --> 01:02:57,348
<i>- Don't answer the phone.</i>
- What the hell you think you're doin'?

786
01:02:57,459 --> 01:02:59,359
Listen to me for a second,
all right, Danny?

787
01:02:59,461 --> 01:03:01,101
Willie can be the last person
who has to die today.

788
01:03:01,102 --> 01:03:01,827
Answer the goddamn phone.

789
01:03:01,931 --> 01:03:05,059
- We'll find Molly.
- Shut up! Answer the goddamn phone.

790
01:03:06,769 --> 01:03:09,761
- It's Claiborne and Toulouse.
- Well done, Danny.

791
01:03:09,872 --> 01:03:13,273
I must say, I am impressed
with your detective skills...

792
01:03:13,375 --> 01:03:15,605
<i>but with all the help</i>
<i>you've been gettin' from the F.B. I...</i>

793
01:03:15,711 --> 01:03:17,770
<i>it seems just a little bit unfair.</i>

794
01:03:17,880 --> 01:03:21,043
I'm playing the game, Miles.
That's all that counts, right?

795
01:03:21,150 --> 01:03:25,348
How very true, but it's time
to see you play for yourself for a change.

796
01:03:25,454 --> 01:03:27,422
Be at the location in the photo
in 10 minutes.

797
01:03:27,523 --> 01:03:30,219
You come alone,
and you'll have a 50-50 chance...

798
01:03:30,326 --> 01:03:32,226
of having the time of your life.

799
01:03:32,328 --> 01:03:34,091
We're more than halfway through, Danny.

800
01:03:34,196 --> 01:03:37,188
And I've got a little bit of a surprise for ya.

801
01:03:51,113 --> 01:03:53,673
Don't be a hero, Ray.

802
01:03:53,782 --> 01:03:55,682
It's not in your pay grade.

803
01:04:10,499 --> 01:04:13,161
<i>Danny, we got two
teams three blocks out.</i>

804
01:04:13,269 --> 01:04:15,169
<i>What do you see?</i>

805
01:04:18,073 --> 01:04:20,007
I don't see anything.

806
01:04:20,109 --> 01:04:23,442
He said 10 minutes, Danny.
It's been 10.

807
01:04:33,122 --> 01:04:35,682
<i>Still got nothin'.</i>

808
01:04:37,793 --> 01:04:40,762
<i>Just stay in your position.</i>

809
01:04:40,863 --> 01:04:43,161
<i>We got you covered.</i>
<i>Stay right there.</i>

810
01:04:44,697 --> 01:04:47,292
Whatever.
I don't know if he's gonna go pro.

811
01:04:47,403 --> 01:04:50,998
- Tell me you've got something.
- Danny, get ready to be happy.

812
01:04:51,106 --> 01:04:54,166
I got a pissed-off member
of the Black Liberation Army is what I got.

813
01:04:54,276 --> 01:04:56,437
Miles had him kill a couple guards
during the prison break...

814
01:04:56,545 --> 01:04:59,105
and then left the brother behind
to take the fall.

815
01:04:59,214 --> 01:05:02,206
- When can you get him to talk?
- Soon as I get the judge to sign the warrant.

816
01:05:02,318 --> 01:05:04,377
<i>Give me 10 minutes.</i>

817
01:05:07,823 --> 01:05:11,190
- I'm gonna need it in two.
<i>- You got a 50-50 chance.</i>

818
01:05:11,293 --> 01:05:14,319
It's the bus.
I'm getting on.

819
01:05:25,841 --> 01:05:27,536
- Molly?
<i>- Stop.</i>

820
01:06:10,486 --> 01:06:12,249
Danny, I love you.

821
01:06:19,828 --> 01:06:21,955
You two lovebirds care for a sit?

822
01:06:29,738 --> 01:06:31,638
I'm gonna get you out of this.

823
01:06:33,642 --> 01:06:37,408
<i>- Was he just talking to someone?</i>
- Just stay calm, Molly.

824
01:06:58,567 --> 01:07:00,467
Ah, well, look at this.
Surprise, surprise.

825
01:07:00,569 --> 01:07:03,094
Testing. Testing.
One-

826
01:07:03,205 --> 01:07:05,730
Was that Miles?

827
01:07:05,841 --> 01:07:08,776
- Does he have Miles on the phone, or is he there?
<i>- Miles is on the bus.</i>

828
01:07:08,877 --> 01:07:11,175
All teams, we have a confirmation.
Miles Jackson is on the bus.

829
01:07:11,280 --> 01:07:15,011
<i>Proceed with Op 2 Delta</i>
<i>and get me a sniper team out here now.</i>

830
01:07:17,453 --> 01:07:19,284
<i>This is it.</i>
<i>This is his mistake.</i>

831
01:07:19,388 --> 01:07:21,788
We got SWAT ready.
Why don't we just take him out now?

832
01:07:21,890 --> 01:07:24,120
We stop that bus now,
he turns this into a bloodbath.

833
01:07:24,226 --> 01:07:26,285
<i>We know where he is.</i>
<i>We're takin' our shot.</i>

834
01:07:26,395 --> 01:07:29,796
Alpha 1, set up
and prepare to stop the target.

835
01:07:29,898 --> 01:07:32,799
<i>Can't have you runnin' off,
now, can I?</i>

836
01:07:35,537 --> 01:07:38,097
<i>Round 7, Danny.</i>

837
01:07:38,207 --> 01:07:42,473
<i>To win, you simply let me walk away.</i>

838
01:07:42,578 --> 01:07:48,039
<i>But if my thumb leaves</i>
<i>the surface of this screen for any reason...</i>

839
01:07:48,150 --> 01:07:51,176
and I don't put it back
within 10 seconds or less...

840
01:07:51,286 --> 01:07:56,383
<i>well, then you lose the round,</i>
<i>and two things happen.</i>

841
01:07:56,492 --> 01:07:59,188
<i>First of all, a small charge explodes...</i>

842
01:07:59,294 --> 01:08:01,785
and fires a three-inch nail
into Molly's heart.

843
01:08:01,897 --> 01:08:04,957
<i>I'm aiming for the right atrium,</i>
<i>but we'll see what happens.</i>

844
01:08:05,067 --> 01:08:07,558
Thirty seconds later, after she's dead...

845
01:08:07,669 --> 01:08:10,661
<i>a second, larger charge will explode...</i>

846
01:08:10,772 --> 01:08:14,367
<i>and they'll be cleaning</i>
<i>everyone up off this bus in pieces.</i>

847
01:08:18,847 --> 01:08:21,839
What can I say, Danny?
I just like to play the game.

848
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:26,580
- I didn't mean for Erica to die.
- I don't think that matters.

849
01:08:30,025 --> 01:08:33,358
That's the one I want.
Set up on the 10 overpass.

850
01:08:33,462 --> 01:08:36,090
<i>SWAT team, this is Agent Santiago.</i>

851
01:08:36,198 --> 01:08:38,666
<i>Take position at the north</i>
<i>on the interstate overpass at Perdido.</i>

852
01:08:38,767 --> 01:08:40,735
<i>Await instructions.</i>

853
01:08:43,871 --> 01:08:45,839
Here. Catch.

854
01:08:49,343 --> 01:08:51,709
<i>Oh, you should see the look on your faces.</i>

855
01:08:51,812 --> 01:08:54,713
Miles, let her go.
It's between you and me.

856
01:08:54,815 --> 01:08:58,251
Well, I'm afraid, if I let Molly go, Danny,
you won't play the game.

857
01:08:58,352 --> 01:09:01,082
<i>Look at those eyes.</i>

858
01:09:01,188 --> 01:09:04,555
You're thinkin',
"Can I get to the phone on time?

859
01:09:04,658 --> 01:09:07,040
Why did Miles ask to meet me here?"

860
01:09:07,075 --> 01:09:09,422
- Ha!
- Is there somethin' funny?

861
01:09:09,532 --> 01:09:12,228
<i>Yeah, there is.</i>

862
01:09:12,335 --> 01:09:14,860
He's gonna win,
and then he's gonna kill you.

863
01:09:14,971 --> 01:09:17,030
She's a feisty one, isn't she?

864
01:09:24,196 --> 01:09:26,687
- Three cover men on the west side.
- Got it.

865
01:09:26,799 --> 01:09:28,960
Jason, you're scout.
Set up section one.

866
01:09:29,068 --> 01:09:32,265
<i>Sniper Team 1,
T.R.T. team in place.</i>

867
01:09:32,371 --> 01:09:36,307
- What if I don't believe you?
- Sorry?

868
01:09:36,409 --> 01:09:39,469
What if I think that vest is for show?

869
01:09:39,579 --> 01:09:43,310
Pick everybody up in pieces?
Miles, that bomb blows, you die too.

870
01:09:44,584 --> 01:09:46,814
What's keeping me
from reaching over there...

871
01:09:46,919 --> 01:09:49,149
and kicking the shit out of you?

872
01:09:49,255 --> 01:09:51,382
Nothing.

873
01:09:51,490 --> 01:09:53,890
<i>But I know you won't-</i>

874
01:09:53,993 --> 01:09:56,154
'cause you're predictable, Danny.

875
01:09:58,064 --> 01:10:00,032
You think I'm lyin'?

876
01:10:01,267 --> 01:10:03,201
Here. Take it.

877
01:10:03,302 --> 01:10:05,270
<i>All teams, hold on my mark.</i>

878
01:10:16,415 --> 01:10:18,815
<i>Sir, that's a 75-yard shot</i>
<i>through a moving bus window.</i>

879
01:10:18,918 --> 01:10:22,012
<i>One sniper's gotta break the glass,</i>
<i>another one's gotta get the hit.</i>

880
01:10:22,121 --> 01:10:24,316
- You sure this is how you wanna do this?
<i>- Team Delta, prepare for visual.</i>

881
01:10:24,423 --> 01:10:27,324
Teams Bravo and Charlie,
hold for extract once shots are fired.

882
01:10:27,426 --> 01:10:30,418
<i>This is Delta 1.</i>
<i>We have confirmed subject, but no clear shot.</i>

883
01:10:30,529 --> 01:10:33,692
No clear shot. Female hostage
is in and out of the target line.

884
01:10:35,201 --> 01:10:38,967
Don't wanna take it? Fine.

885
01:10:39,071 --> 01:10:42,700
Well, here's something
that you will want- clue to Round 8.

886
01:10:47,847 --> 01:10:50,008
<i>Sniper Team 1,
you have the green light.</i>

887
01:10:50,116 --> 01:10:53,449
I repeat. You have the green light.
Take him out.

888
01:10:53,552 --> 01:10:57,181
- You know you're gonna kill that girl.
- I'm gonna kill Miles.

889
01:10:57,890 --> 01:10:59,585
On my mark.

890
01:11:02,495 --> 01:11:04,622
- Go.
- Get down!

891
01:11:10,469 --> 01:11:12,369
Target is not down.

892
01:11:22,515 --> 01:11:26,508
<i>- Move!</i>

893
01:11:26,619 --> 01:11:29,554
Officer Fisher, I didn't know you cared.

894
01:11:29,655 --> 01:11:32,146
<i>- Come on.</i>

895
01:11:32,258 --> 01:11:35,455
- Molly!
<i>- </i>

896
01:11:36,829 --> 01:11:38,888
<i>- What the hell happened?</i>

897
01:11:38,998 --> 01:11:42,195
And get me a 20 on Miles.
Somebody get me a 20 on Miles.

898
01:11:42,301 --> 01:11:44,428
<i>Negative.</i>
<i>Lost him in the crowd.</i>

899
01:11:50,509 --> 01:11:52,977
I need you to stop everything
getting on the 10 and the 90.

900
01:11:53,079 --> 01:11:55,912
<i>Hear me.
The 10 needs to stop traffic.</i>

901
01:11:56,015 --> 01:12:00,611
Clear!

902
01:12:00,720 --> 01:12:03,280
<i>Listen here.
Ready to do this?</i>

903
01:12:07,693 --> 01:12:09,923
<i>You could've killed her! You knew</i>
<i>she was there and you took the shot!</i>

904
01:12:10,029 --> 01:12:13,068
Listen to me, you little shit!
We had him! This was over!

905
01:12:13,069 --> 01:12:13,487
<i>No!</i>

906
01:12:13,599 --> 01:12:15,499
You shoot Miles,
everybody on that bus is dead!

907
01:12:15,601 --> 01:12:19,093
<i>You didn't know that, did you, you prick!</i>

908
01:12:19,205 --> 01:12:21,105
She had a bomb on her chest.

909
01:12:21,207 --> 01:12:23,835
<i>You shoot Miles, everybody dies.</i>

910
01:12:27,980 --> 01:12:30,312
You got a little somethin' right there.

911
01:12:30,416 --> 01:12:32,782
<i>You heard him.
Back 'em up.</i>

912
01:12:32,885 --> 01:12:34,819
<i>Any witnesses see him get off the bus?</i>

913
01:12:39,458 --> 01:12:42,325
You okay, Danny?
You all right?

914
01:12:42,428 --> 01:12:44,953
I had her in my arms, man.

915
01:12:45,064 --> 01:12:47,362
I told her I was gonna save her,
and I let her go.

916
01:12:47,466 --> 01:12:50,526
There was nothing you could do, bro.

917
01:12:50,636 --> 01:12:52,797
Molly's gonna die.
It's my fault.

918
01:12:52,905 --> 01:12:54,896
She's not gonna die, Danny.
You gotta stop blaming yourself.

919
01:12:55,007 --> 01:12:56,907
I can't. You know why?

920
01:12:57,009 --> 01:12:59,170
Because Miles is punishing Molly
for something I did.

921
01:12:59,278 --> 01:13:01,439
- Danny, you were doing your job.
- I don't care!

922
01:13:03,115 --> 01:13:05,879
Miles doesn't care.

923
01:13:05,985 --> 01:13:08,954
It's me and him-
an eye for an eye.

924
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:13,890
- Danny.
- I was three feet- I was three feet away.

925
01:13:13,993 --> 01:13:15,893
And I couldn't make a move.

926
01:13:15,995 --> 01:13:19,226
Stop. Just stop it, man.
You won the round.

927
01:13:19,331 --> 01:13:23,165
Most importantly, you bought us some time.
And now I got a name.

928
01:13:23,269 --> 01:13:25,863
- Remember the convict who wanted to cut a deal?
- Yeah.

929
01:13:25,971 --> 01:13:29,600
He said Miles played chess every day in the
prison yard with a guy named Anthony Deluso.

930
01:13:29,708 --> 01:13:34,338
Best part? Deluso got paroled three weeks
before the prison break, and he's in town.

931
01:13:34,446 --> 01:13:36,778
Jansen's on his way to get the address
from his P.O. right now.

932
01:13:36,882 --> 01:13:39,612
- What the hell you doin' here?
- I knew my boy needed me.

933
01:13:39,718 --> 01:13:43,484
Wait, wait. Here we go.

934
01:13:43,589 --> 01:13:46,456
Go for Hank. Yeah.

935
01:13:46,559 --> 01:13:48,652
Okay, tell Phelps
I'll meet him there in 10 minutes.

936
01:13:48,761 --> 01:13:51,730
- Bingo. 212 Perdido.
- You got him.

937
01:13:51,831 --> 01:13:53,432
We're finally gettin' ahead
of this son of a bitch.

938
01:13:53,433 --> 01:13:53,924
<i>I told you.</i>

939
01:13:54,033 --> 01:13:56,558
I told you I wasn't gonna let you down.

940
01:13:57,603 --> 01:13:59,400
- All right, bro.
- Hank.

941
01:13:59,505 --> 01:14:02,941
- Yo.
- Be careful.

942
01:14:03,042 --> 01:14:04,942
When am I not?

943
01:14:08,480 --> 01:14:11,711
Hey.

944
01:14:11,817 --> 01:14:14,285
You know you can't do this alone.
All right?

945
01:14:14,386 --> 01:14:17,480
<i>Listen to me, Danny.</i>
<i>I'm not gonna ask you to stop.</i>

946
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:20,115
I'm just gonna ask you to let me help you.

947
01:14:20,226 --> 01:14:22,854
We do this together,
we can both get what we want.

948
01:14:22,962 --> 01:14:25,328
Round 8.

949
01:14:25,431 --> 01:14:27,922
- There's five numbers inside this envelope.
- Let me help you.

950
01:14:28,033 --> 01:14:29,967
Choose wisely, and the number you dial...

951
01:14:30,069 --> 01:14:31,661
will win the round without further action.

952
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:34,261
Choose poorly, and the number you dial...

953
01:14:34,373 --> 01:14:36,967
<i>will arm one of four devices</i>
<i>scattered throughout the city.</i>

954
01:14:37,076 --> 01:14:40,603
<i>You now have 60 seconds.</i>
<i>If you refuse to dial in that allotted time...</i>

955
01:14:40,713 --> 01:14:43,841
<i>all four will be activated</i>
<i>and you'll have yourself quite an adventure.</i>

956
01:14:43,949 --> 01:14:46,577
<i>- Good luck.</i>
- Let's run these through the local directory.

957
01:14:46,685 --> 01:14:48,983
No directory.
They're devices, not locations.

958
01:14:49,088 --> 01:14:51,522
That doesn't make any sense.
It's gotta be a code then.

959
01:14:51,624 --> 01:14:55,025
Okay, let's try it.

960
01:14:55,127 --> 01:14:58,619
<i>Text. They're text messages.</i>
<i>The first one's city hall.</i>

961
01:14:58,731 --> 01:15:01,097
All right.

962
01:15:01,200 --> 01:15:03,668
Second one is the convention center.

963
01:15:03,769 --> 01:15:06,294
Danny, we got less than 10 seconds.
We got three numbers left.

964
01:15:06,405 --> 01:15:09,738
You gotta pick one.

965
01:15:09,842 --> 01:15:13,608
Sorry, Danny, you lose.
And now Round 9 is gonna be so much fun.

966
01:15:15,748 --> 01:15:20,276
<i>Very shortly, Streetcar 907 will enter</i>
<i>the downtown area on Canal Street.</i>

967
01:15:20,386 --> 01:15:23,480
<i>You've just disarmed the brakes</i>
<i>and the communication radio.</i>

968
01:15:23,589 --> 01:15:25,784
<i>Your task is simply stop the streetcar...</i>

969
01:15:25,891 --> 01:15:27,791
before it smashes
through the end of the line...

970
01:15:27,893 --> 01:15:30,361
<i>and everything else in its path.</i>

971
01:15:30,462 --> 01:15:33,022
Let's take that one.
Come on. Let's go.

972
01:15:44,810 --> 01:15:48,371
This is Special Agent Ray Santiago of the F.B.I.
I have an emergency.

973
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:52,883
Streetcar 907 has lost its brakes
and is speeding toward the riverfront.

974
01:15:52,985 --> 01:15:55,604
Keep following the 10.
We'll intersect them at Canal.

975
01:15:55,605 --> 01:15:55,749
Yeah.

976
01:15:55,854 --> 01:15:58,152
No, this is not a prank phone call.

977
01:15:58,257 --> 01:16:00,851
My name is Special Agent Ray Santiago
of the F.B.I.

978
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:04,225
<i>- I need to talk to somebody that can help-</i>

979
01:16:05,965 --> 01:16:08,092
She put me on hold.

980
01:16:22,715 --> 01:16:24,706
<i>- Come on, come on. Pick up the phone.</i>

981
01:16:25,784 --> 01:16:27,843
<i>They're playing Barry Manilow.</i>

982
01:16:29,221 --> 01:16:31,416
<i>Pick up the phone!</i>

983
01:16:31,523 --> 01:16:33,582
No, no. We're on our way
to intercept right now.

984
01:16:33,692 --> 01:16:37,685
Is there anyone there
that can help us make this decision?

985
01:16:37,796 --> 01:16:40,196
Shut down the power. You shut down
the power, the streetcar comes to a stop.

986
01:16:40,299 --> 01:16:42,699
Can't you guys just shut down the power?

987
01:16:42,801 --> 01:16:46,066
Miss, one more time for the cheap seats.
This is not a prank phone call.

988
01:16:49,742 --> 01:16:53,143
- Unit 23. You guys in position?
- All clear along the perimeter.

989
01:16:53,245 --> 01:16:55,611
- We got four units waiting around the corner.
- Copy that.

990
01:16:55,714 --> 01:16:58,410
Let's see who's home.

991
01:17:06,358 --> 01:17:09,293
<i>Step right up!
Ring the bell and get a prize!</i>

992
01:17:26,578 --> 01:17:31,777
- Streetcar 907 to Dispatch. Come in.
<i>- What's going on?</i>

993
01:17:31,884 --> 01:17:34,079
Streetcar 907.
Does anyone hear me?

994
01:17:37,589 --> 01:17:40,922
- How fast you think that thing's goin'?
- 30 tons of metal going downhill?

995
01:17:41,026 --> 01:17:43,153
- Forty?
- Probably 50.

996
01:17:48,233 --> 01:17:50,463
Will somebody please pick up
the goddamn phone!

997
01:18:07,219 --> 01:18:09,483
<i>Target is heading
out the back door.</i>

998
01:18:09,588 --> 01:18:11,954
- Do you want me to take him?
- Negative.

999
01:18:12,057 --> 01:18:13,991
Negative. Suspect is on the move.

1000
01:18:14,093 --> 01:18:17,119
Let's see where he's going.
Phelps and I will follow him.

1001
01:18:27,506 --> 01:18:29,997
Aren't we going too fast?
I think we'd better hang on.

1002
01:18:37,316 --> 01:18:41,377
Let us out!

1003
01:18:41,487 --> 01:18:44,081
Danny, unless we cut the power,
that thing's not gonna stop.

1004
01:18:44,189 --> 01:18:47,090
I got an idea.

1005
01:18:54,833 --> 01:18:56,562
Danny, what are you doin'?

1006
01:19:09,481 --> 01:19:10,573
Danny?

1007
01:19:26,965 --> 01:19:31,265
Keep it straight
and keep your foot on the brake.

1008
01:19:41,380 --> 01:19:43,473
Are you outta your damn mind?

1009
01:19:43,582 --> 01:19:45,482
Maybe.

1010
01:19:58,263 --> 01:20:00,561
Danny! Look out!

1011
01:20:01,500 --> 01:20:03,559
Whoa!

1012
01:20:11,009 --> 01:20:12,499
Get back!

1013
01:20:18,116 --> 01:20:21,313
<i>It's out of control.
I've tried the brake.</i>

1014
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:23,650
Help me! Harder!

1015
01:20:26,558 --> 01:20:30,153
Harder! It's jammed!

1016
01:20:30,262 --> 01:20:32,958
Open the door.
I'll try to cut the power from the roof.

1017
01:20:33,065 --> 01:20:35,363
What's he doing?

1018
01:21:01,827 --> 01:21:03,124
Whoa!

1019
01:21:31,156 --> 01:21:34,990
<i>All units, suspect is entering</i>
<i>the Dixie welding factory on Fitzpatrick.</i>

1020
01:21:35,093 --> 01:21:36,993
Wait for my "Go."

1021
01:21:53,278 --> 01:21:56,179
- Didn't work.
- Look out! Look out! Look out!

1022
01:22:29,681 --> 01:22:31,546
<i>What now?</i>

1023
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:34,619
- We take out the power.
- You are outta your damn mind.

1024
01:22:36,355 --> 01:22:39,449
- You ever jump out of a moving car before?
- Not by choice.

1025
01:23:02,914 --> 01:23:08,250
- It's still goin' too fast! Get down!
- Move! Move!

1026
01:23:08,353 --> 01:23:10,617
<i>- Get outta the way!</i>
- Outta the way! Move! Move! Move!

1027
01:23:10,722 --> 01:23:13,748
<i>- Get down!</i>
- Get outta the way!

1028
01:23:13,859 --> 01:23:16,987
Move! Move!

1029
01:23:17,095 --> 01:23:19,586
<i>- Move! Move! Move!</i>
- Everybody outta the way!

1030
01:23:19,698 --> 01:23:22,667
Get down!

1031
01:23:41,420 --> 01:23:46,050
<i>- Everybody all right?</i>

1032
01:23:49,995 --> 01:23:53,556
- You guys all right?
<i>- Thank God!</i>

1033
01:23:53,665 --> 01:23:55,792
<i>- Is everybody okay?</i>
<i>- You okay, man?</i>

1034
01:24:11,783 --> 01:24:13,683
<i>- Yeah?</i>
- We're here.

1035
01:24:13,785 --> 01:24:15,753
<i>I'm gettin' the truck now.</i>

1036
01:24:26,347 --> 01:24:28,611
Is she okay? You okay, darlin'?

1037
01:24:28,716 --> 01:24:30,616
- Yeah, she's okay.
- Yeah?

1038
01:24:32,702 --> 01:24:35,262
That'd be great. That's a great idea.
Why don't you guys go ahead and do that.

1039
01:24:35,371 --> 01:24:37,271
Thank you.

1040
01:24:38,841 --> 01:24:40,900
They're gonna shut off the power.

1041
01:24:48,051 --> 01:24:50,019
This is gettin' a little too easy, Miles.

1042
01:24:50,119 --> 01:24:52,087
What, are you gettin' soft on me?

1043
01:24:52,188 --> 01:24:54,179
How about you give me something
that's gonna be a challenge?

1044
01:24:54,290 --> 01:24:56,190
You sound pretty pleased
with yourself, Danny.

1045
01:24:56,292 --> 01:24:58,192
Why? Because you stopped the trolley...

1046
01:24:58,294 --> 01:25:01,058
<i>or because you went ahead</i>
<i>with your own round?</i>

1047
01:25:01,164 --> 01:25:03,064
Very admirable. Okay.

1048
01:25:03,166 --> 01:25:06,761
<i>- Welding factory. Second floor hallway.</i>

1049
01:25:06,869 --> 01:25:09,235
<i>If Round 10 is your best friend</i>
<i>takin' Anthony Deluso...</i>

1050
01:25:09,338 --> 01:25:12,899
then Round 11
is me taking your best friend.

1051
01:25:24,987 --> 01:25:25,541
Hank, pick up.

1052
01:25:25,542 --> 01:25:27,478
The person
you are calling is not-

1053
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:29,751
- It's going to voice mail.
- You all right?

1054
01:25:32,662 --> 01:25:35,563
<i>You are persistent.</i>

1055
01:25:35,665 --> 01:25:37,895
Shit.

1056
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,834
<i>Attaboy.</i>

1057
01:25:41,938 --> 01:25:44,202
<i>You honestly didn't think</i>
<i>a man like Miles...</i>

1058
01:25:44,307 --> 01:25:47,242
wouldn't have a plan
for something like this?

1059
01:25:52,548 --> 01:25:55,108
Whatever the plan is,
apparently you're not part of it.

1060
01:25:56,452 --> 01:25:57,419
Bitch.

1061
01:26:06,196 --> 01:26:08,164
<i>I don't have anything, man.</i>

1062
01:26:08,265 --> 01:26:10,699
<i>I got somebody on the phone.</i>
<i>I'm trying to get you a straight answer.</i>

1063
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,495
- Nobody's got anything.
- How can you not get a straight answer?

1064
01:26:12,602 --> 01:26:14,570
Miles knew about it.
He knew about everything.

1065
01:26:14,671 --> 01:26:17,265
He knew about Hank. He knew about Deluso.
He was at the warehouse.

1066
01:26:17,374 --> 01:26:20,605
- I hear what you're sayin'.
- It's been a half hour. Something, anything.

1067
01:26:20,710 --> 01:26:22,473
<i>Danny.</i>

1068
01:26:22,579 --> 01:26:24,342
There was an explosion at the factory.

1069
01:26:24,447 --> 01:26:27,848
There are firefighters on the scene now,
but Hank was inside.

1070
01:26:27,951 --> 01:26:30,010
There's no way he could've made it.

1071
01:26:31,888 --> 01:26:33,981
I'm sorry.

1072
01:26:40,730 --> 01:26:42,994
Danny, wait.
Danny, wait, wait.

1073
01:26:43,099 --> 01:26:46,398
- Get off of me!
- Hey.

1074
01:26:46,503 --> 01:26:49,370
Okay, look, three years ago...

1075
01:26:49,472 --> 01:26:53,568
Miles stole three Stingers
from a U.S. military shipment in Iraq.

1076
01:26:53,677 --> 01:26:56,237
We tracked him to Pakistan.
But the day the deal went down...

1077
01:26:56,346 --> 01:26:59,509
I lost Miles and I lost the guns.

1078
01:26:59,616 --> 01:27:01,641
Two days later, one of those Stingers...

1079
01:27:01,751 --> 01:27:04,481
shot down a 747 out of Islamabad.

1080
01:27:04,587 --> 01:27:09,024
This was the only thing
I could find intact in the rubble.

1081
01:27:12,095 --> 01:27:14,757
What I'm saying is I made a mistake here.

1082
01:27:14,864 --> 01:27:16,923
I forgot why I carry this.
This isn't about Miles.

1083
01:27:17,033 --> 01:27:20,264
This is about the people he's hurt
and the ones he's gonna hurt.

1084
01:27:26,843 --> 01:27:29,778
- Guys, I'm never gonna see her again.
- Don't say that.

1085
01:27:29,879 --> 01:27:31,972
Yes, you are.
We got one round left.

1086
01:27:32,082 --> 01:27:35,677
And I know Miles better
than any person alive. Let me help you.

1087
01:27:45,428 --> 01:27:47,157
<i>#Oh, Danny boy #

1088
01:27:47,263 --> 01:27:50,790
<i># The pipes</i>
<i>the pipes are calling ##</i>

1089
01:27:50,900 --> 01:27:53,630
Sorry about the delay, Danny.

1090
01:27:53,737 --> 01:27:56,399
<i>But I think that we're just about ready</i>
<i>for our grand finale.</i>

1091
01:27:56,506 --> 01:27:59,270
It is Round 12, and, this time...

1092
01:27:59,376 --> 01:28:01,241
we won't be goin'
to the judges' scorecards.

1093
01:28:01,344 --> 01:28:05,041
In 17 minutes, it will be exactly one year
since Erica's death...

1094
01:28:05,148 --> 01:28:09,244
<i>and I have to ask-</i>
<i>will Molly suffer a similar fate?</i>

1095
01:28:12,489 --> 01:28:14,821
- Miles, you don't have to do this.
- Too late.

1096
01:28:14,924 --> 01:28:16,892
You've done well to survive this long.

1097
01:28:16,993 --> 01:28:19,461
Now all you have to do is find her.

1098
01:28:19,562 --> 01:28:22,395
She has a touch phone
strapped to her chest...

1099
01:28:22,499 --> 01:28:24,660
along with some other,
more explosive items.

1100
01:28:24,768 --> 01:28:27,965
Except this time, only your thumbprint...

1101
01:28:28,071 --> 01:28:30,505
only your touch, can stop the timer.

1102
01:28:32,375 --> 01:28:34,275
Tell me where she is.

1103
01:28:34,377 --> 01:28:36,277
Are you sorry for what you've done?

1104
01:28:40,517 --> 01:28:42,815
Yes, Miles, I'm sorry.

1105
01:28:42,919 --> 01:28:46,082
Then perhaps maybe you should
pay her a visit, tell her so yourself.

1106
01:28:46,189 --> 01:28:48,623
It's been fun, Danny, but game over.

1107
01:28:51,194 --> 01:28:53,128
Pay Erica a visit?

1108
01:28:54,697 --> 01:28:57,666
<i>It's the cemetery. Where is she buried?</i>
<i>Where is she buried?</i>

1109
01:29:00,804 --> 01:29:03,466
<i>I need you to pull the cemetery records</i>
<i>of all Orleans Parish.</i>

1110
01:29:03,573 --> 01:29:06,406
<i>Last name: Kessen.</i>
<i>K-E-S-S-E-N.</i>

1111
01:29:06,509 --> 01:29:08,670
<i>First name: Erica.</i>
<i>That's with a "C."</i>

1112
01:29:08,778 --> 01:29:11,144
This is Ray Santiago of the F.B.I.
I need a police escort.

1113
01:29:11,247 --> 01:29:14,978
<i>We are Canal and Royal</i>
<i>heading out of the C.B.D.</i>

1114
01:29:15,084 --> 01:29:17,712
<i>Metairie Cemetery.</i>

1115
01:29:17,821 --> 01:29:19,755
<i>Tell whoever gets there-</i>
<i>don't touch anything.</i>

1116
01:29:19,856 --> 01:29:22,290
- I'm the only one that can defuse that bomb.
- We know, Danny.

1117
01:29:33,670 --> 01:29:37,367
<i>- Anybody on the scene yet?</i>
- They're arriving now, but remember, this is Miles.

1118
01:29:37,474 --> 01:29:39,169
The cemetery might just be the first step.

1119
01:29:40,086 --> 01:29:41,766
That's bullshit! Why have I
been doing this shit all day?

1120
01:29:41,878 --> 01:29:43,812
If he wanted to kill us,
he should've done it when he had the chance.

1121
01:29:43,913 --> 01:29:45,813
Danny, your phone.

1122
01:29:47,183 --> 01:29:49,310
- Yeah?
- Danny. Chuck Jansen.

1123
01:29:49,419 --> 01:29:52,320
Two things Hank had me working on-
they're not making any sense.

1124
01:29:52,422 --> 01:29:54,481
<i>I ran a trace</i>
<i>on all five numbers from earlier.</i>

1125
01:29:54,591 --> 01:29:58,357
<i>They were all connected to the device</i>
<i>under the streetcar. All five numbers.</i>

1126
01:29:58,461 --> 01:30:01,328
Not only that, Miles had remote cameras
in the elevator shaft.

1127
01:30:01,431 --> 01:30:05,231
<i>We pulled the tapes.</i>
<i>He blew the device early, Danny.</i>

1128
01:30:05,335 --> 01:30:07,030
You still had five seconds to save Willie.

1129
01:30:07,136 --> 01:30:10,071
Like I said, it was the last thing
Hank had me working on, but-

1130
01:30:13,610 --> 01:30:15,635
Danny, Danny. Danny, why are we stopping?

1131
01:30:18,815 --> 01:30:23,252
- Willie was always gonna die.
- What are you talking about?

1132
01:30:23,353 --> 01:30:25,378
Miles had security cameras
in the elevator.

1133
01:30:25,488 --> 01:30:27,456
Saw I was gonna save him
and blew the charge early.

1134
01:30:27,557 --> 01:30:32,221
<i>And all those numbers-all five of them-</i>
<i>were connected to the same streetcar.</i>

1135
01:30:32,328 --> 01:30:34,853
You already told me once, George.

1136
01:30:34,964 --> 01:30:36,864
I arrested this guy.
I don't even know him.

1137
01:30:36,966 --> 01:30:39,696
<i>This is your guy.</i>
<i>What am I missing?</i>

1138
01:30:41,504 --> 01:30:43,369
Joshua.

1139
01:30:43,473 --> 01:30:46,806
- Every time he plays, what does Miles want?
<i>- He wants to win.</i>

1140
01:30:46,910 --> 01:30:49,401
Miles wants to be the guy
that nobody can beat.

1141
01:30:49,512 --> 01:30:52,913
The deal with Samuel and Joshua. He went
to a lot of trouble to get some revenge.

1142
01:30:53,016 --> 01:30:55,576
- But what else did we find in the car?
- Diamonds.

1143
01:30:55,685 --> 01:30:57,778
He steals from the U.S. military,
he sells it for a profit.

1144
01:30:57,887 --> 01:31:00,913
He's had Molly for over three and a half hours.
Not once has he mentioned ransom.

1145
01:31:01,024 --> 01:31:03,424
- This isn't about revenge.
- It is about the money.

1146
01:31:03,526 --> 01:31:07,986
Ray, give me all the information we got
on the security guard from the hotel.

1147
01:31:16,940 --> 01:31:20,774
Willie Dumaine has a second job
as a Homewood Security guard.

1148
01:31:23,580 --> 01:31:25,480
Hi. I'm Tom Baxter.

1149
01:31:25,582 --> 01:31:28,574
Office called,
said Willie Dumaine's a no-show.

1150
01:31:28,685 --> 01:31:31,745
I'm pickin' up his shift.
Thank you.

1151
01:31:33,456 --> 01:31:35,356
<i>This guy's had us runnin' all day.</i>

1152
01:31:35,458 --> 01:31:37,824
For one second,
we've just gotta stop and think.

1153
01:31:37,927 --> 01:31:40,293
- Today, what did I actually do?
- Does this even matter?

1154
01:31:40,396 --> 01:31:42,330
You're still the only one
who can deactivate that bomb.

1155
01:31:42,432 --> 01:31:44,195
He took my house.
He took Molly.

1156
01:31:44,300 --> 01:31:47,030
That's what he did to get you to play.
What else happened at the hotel?

1157
01:31:49,439 --> 01:31:53,273
<i>He blew the gas lines.</i>
<i>They evacuated three city blocks.</i>

1158
01:31:53,376 --> 01:31:56,311
Three city blocks?
Get me a list of those buildings.

1159
01:32:10,259 --> 01:32:13,422
<i>Any one of those numbers-any one</i>
<i>would've gone back to that very streetcar.</i>

1160
01:32:13,529 --> 01:32:16,020
- I had to stop the streetcar.
<i>- No, no, no. You had to cut the power.</i>

1161
01:32:16,132 --> 01:32:18,464
After Katrina, when the power
was out all over the city-

1162
01:32:18,568 --> 01:32:21,401
Homewood Security comes in
to move all the unprotected cash.

1163
01:32:21,504 --> 01:32:23,995
Wait a second.
What was that last one?

1164
01:32:24,107 --> 01:32:27,201
Holy shit. One of the buildings
that we evacuated...

1165
01:32:27,310 --> 01:32:30,302
is a temporary holding facility
for the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.

1166
01:32:32,615 --> 01:32:34,549
That's the goddamn mint.

1167
01:32:45,428 --> 01:32:47,396
<i>Our backup generator's</i>
<i>gonna run out at midnight.</i>

1168
01:32:54,203 --> 01:32:57,934
<i>Fed's been pullin' all the old hundreds</i>
<i>and fifties out of circulation.</i>

1169
01:32:58,041 --> 01:33:00,202
<i>That's the entire Southeast allotment.</i>

1170
01:33:00,309 --> 01:33:02,607
- Total's just over-
- $100 million?

1171
01:33:04,213 --> 01:33:06,613
<i>Hey, Ray, you go with SWAT to the mint...</i>

1172
01:33:06,716 --> 01:33:08,616
and you shut everything down-
all cars, all pedestrians.

1173
01:33:08,718 --> 01:33:10,447
You stop it,
and you lock it in the Quarter.

1174
01:33:10,553 --> 01:33:12,578
We got eight minutes
to get you to the cemetery.

1175
01:33:12,689 --> 01:33:15,180
- Don't you want Miles?
- Not till we get Molly.

1176
01:33:20,963 --> 01:33:23,227
Thanks.

1177
01:33:23,332 --> 01:33:25,800
Thank me when it's over.

1178
01:33:58,701 --> 01:34:02,000
Tell me something. If Miles knows
we're shutting down the city...

1179
01:34:02,105 --> 01:34:04,005
how's he getting the money out?

1180
01:34:08,077 --> 01:34:11,308
<i>Only emergency vehicles are leaving the Quarter.</i>
<i>Miles isn't gettin' anywhere.</i>

1181
01:34:11,414 --> 01:34:13,814
<i>See, in your time constraints...</i>

1182
01:34:13,916 --> 01:34:16,248
you might want to use
the fire truck for this one.

1183
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:19,485
<i>- Hey.</i>

1184
01:34:19,589 --> 01:34:22,114
Hey, what are you doin'?
Molly's at the cemetery.

1185
01:34:22,225 --> 01:34:25,592
Nope. That asshole even told me
to wear the hat and use the siren.

1186
01:35:00,997 --> 01:35:04,398
Everything I did today had a purpose.
From the time Molly walked out the door...

1187
01:35:04,500 --> 01:35:06,400
<i>there isn't a thing I did today</i>
<i>that Miles didn't plan.</i>

1188
01:35:06,502 --> 01:35:09,562
<i>He makes sure I wreck the fire truck</i>
<i>so he could steal it.</i>

1189
01:35:09,672 --> 01:35:11,503
<i>He threatens my brother</i>
<i>so I'm not thinking straight.</i>

1190
01:35:11,607 --> 01:35:13,905
<i>He shows me Molly</i>
<i>to keep me in the game. It's obvious.</i>

1191
01:35:14,010 --> 01:35:17,377
If she's still alive,
Molly's his ticket out.

1192
01:35:22,318 --> 01:35:24,650
I need to speak with hospital security.

1193
01:35:31,761 --> 01:35:34,229
Wake up, baby.
We're here.

1194
01:35:59,322 --> 01:36:02,018
Almost finished.

1195
01:36:02,124 --> 01:36:05,685
You do like I say, and we will both
live happily ever after.

1196
01:36:11,234 --> 01:36:15,762
Now, where are those body bags?

1197
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:19,805
<i>Attention, all hospital personnel.</i>

1198
01:36:19,909 --> 01:36:22,469
<i>Explosion reported outside east wing.</i>

1199
01:36:22,578 --> 01:36:24,478
<i>Please report to your stations.</i>

1200
01:36:24,580 --> 01:36:26,775
<i>Attention, all hospital personnel.</i>

1201
01:36:26,883 --> 01:36:28,783
<i>Explosion reported outside the east wing.</i>

1202
01:36:28,885 --> 01:36:32,150
<i>Please report to your stations, stat.</i>

1203
01:36:35,658 --> 01:36:38,422
<i>It's an explosion.
They need us down there.</i>

1204
01:36:38,527 --> 01:36:40,791
No, I'm not sure.
I'm going there right now.

1205
01:37:13,296 --> 01:37:16,925
Cordon off University Hospital.
Let nobody in or out.

1206
01:37:25,675 --> 01:37:27,870
Think you can fly us
to Tahiti in this thing, yeah?

1207
01:37:30,613 --> 01:37:32,581
Get in.

1208
01:37:35,785 --> 01:37:37,446
They're here.

1209
01:37:40,156 --> 01:37:43,523
<i>She's taking off.</i>

1210
01:37:47,496 --> 01:37:49,691
Eagle 1,
<i>is that you up there?</i>

1211
01:37:49,799 --> 01:37:52,199
You have not been authorized for takeoff.

1212
01:37:52,301 --> 01:37:53,962
<i>Eagle 1 requesting-</i>

1213
01:37:54,070 --> 01:37:55,697
Fly!

1214
01:38:13,489 --> 01:38:16,219
You're not stalling on me,
darlin', are ya?

1215
01:38:16,325 --> 01:38:18,259
If you wanna fly this thing, you go ahead.

1216
01:38:18,361 --> 01:38:21,091
Yeah, well, how about you teach me?

1217
01:38:47,857 --> 01:38:50,621
Take us up!
Take us up!

1218
01:38:50,726 --> 01:38:52,785
- You all right?
- Go!

1219
01:38:52,895 --> 01:38:54,692
Make a good decision.

1220
01:39:06,475 --> 01:39:08,773
Danny!

1221
01:39:12,681 --> 01:39:14,478
You're gonna be fun to kill.

1222
01:39:18,054 --> 01:39:20,284
- Uh!
- Oh!

1223
01:39:33,536 --> 01:39:35,504
<i>Danny, he's got a gun!</i>

1224
01:39:50,753 --> 01:39:52,516
<i>We're losing hydraulic pressure.</i>

1225
01:39:52,621 --> 01:39:55,749
<i>I need to find a place to put her down.</i>

1226
01:39:55,858 --> 01:39:57,609
<i>Can you make it back
to the hospital?</i>

1227
01:39:57,610 --> 01:39:57,792
Negative.

1228
01:39:57,893 --> 01:40:01,852
I need to stabilize flight controls,
or else we are going down.

1229
01:40:01,964 --> 01:40:05,593
<i>Gun, Danny!</i>
<i>He's going for the gun!</i>

1230
01:40:09,105 --> 01:40:11,130
<i>Mayday! Mayday! This is</i> Eagle 1!</i>

1231
01:40:18,247 --> 01:40:21,114
Tell me you can still land this thing.

1232
01:40:21,217 --> 01:40:22,946
<i>He busted the hydraulics.</i>
<i>We're going down, Danny.</i>

1233
01:40:23,052 --> 01:40:24,781
<i>Please confirm status,</i> Eagle 1!</i>

1234
01:40:24,887 --> 01:40:26,787
<i>Damn it! Danny!</i>

1235
01:40:31,994 --> 01:40:34,690
- I gotta set her down.
- Please confirm status, <i>Eagle 1!</i>

1236
01:40:47,842 --> 01:40:49,901
<i>Clear emergency landing.</i>

1237
01:40:50,011 --> 01:40:51,740
<i>Danny!</i>

1238
01:40:53,581 --> 01:40:55,254
<i>Danny! Talk to me!</i>

1239
01:40:55,289 --> 01:40:59,123
Knockout, Danny! This time,
you're not gonna get saved by the bell.

1240
01:40:59,226 --> 01:41:00,716
Hold on, Danny!
Hold on!

1241
01:41:10,404 --> 01:41:13,202
<i>Danny! We're out of time!</i>

1242
01:41:13,307 --> 01:41:17,710
- I can't control it anymore!
<i>- Eagle 1,</i> this is Tower. Stand by.

1243
01:41:17,812 --> 01:41:19,780
You lose!

1244
01:41:19,880 --> 01:41:23,714
<i>Danny, strap in!</i>
<i>We're going down!</i>

1245
01:41:23,818 --> 01:41:27,276
- Eagle 1, <i>you are cleared for emergency landing.</i>
<i>- Officer Fisher!</i>

1246
01:41:27,388 --> 01:41:29,185
One last move.

1247
01:41:29,290 --> 01:41:32,453
Remember the vest from the bus?

1248
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:35,996
- Knockout.
- No!

1249
01:41:36,097 --> 01:41:38,531
<i>Oh, my God!</i>
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

1250
01:41:38,633 --> 01:41:41,693
<i>Get in the seat!</i>
<i>I can still put her down.</i>

1251
01:41:41,802 --> 01:41:44,498
- Danny, strap in.
- Not in time.

1252
01:41:44,605 --> 01:41:46,505
<i>Yes, I can!</i>

1253
01:41:46,607 --> 01:41:48,074
- What are you doing?
- We gotta get out of here.

1254
01:41:48,175 --> 01:41:50,507
<i>No. What are you do-</i>
<i>No! No!</i>

1255
01:41:50,611 --> 01:41:52,806
Do you trust me?

1256
01:41:52,913 --> 01:41:54,972
Yes.

1257
01:41:55,082 --> 01:41:56,879
Come on.

1258
01:41:59,453 --> 01:42:01,421
You land it!

1259
01:42:01,522 --> 01:42:02,853
Bitch.

1260
01:43:03,166 --> 01:43:05,999
I never doubted you.

1261
01:43:06,102 --> 01:43:09,469
That makes one of us.

1262
01:43:13,643 --> 01:43:16,578
What hurts?

1263
01:43:16,679 --> 01:43:19,170
Everything.

1264
01:43:23,119 --> 01:43:26,577
Oh!

1265

1267
01:43:34,597 --> 01:43:37,566
Helicopter explosion.
No big deal.

1268
01:43:39,436 --> 01:43:42,599
Let's get you home.

1269
01:43:44,841 --> 01:43:46,809
