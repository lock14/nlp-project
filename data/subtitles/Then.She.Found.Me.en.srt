1
00:00:23,939 --> 00:00:26,025
Ein, zwei, drei, vier!

2
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:39,830
<i>There is a Jewish story.</i>

3
00:00:39,872 --> 00:00:41,624
<i>An ordinary Jewish joke.</i>

4
00:00:41,665 --> 00:00:44,835
<i>A father was teaching his little son
to be less afraid,</i>

5
00:00:44,877 --> 00:00:48,297
<i>to have more courage,
by having him jump down the stairs.</i>

6
00:00:48,297 --> 00:00:52,426
<i>He put his son on the second stair
and said, "Jump, and I'll catch you. "</i>

7
00:00:52,468 --> 00:00:56,347
<i>Then on the third stair, and said,
"Jump, and I'll catch you. "</i>

8
00:00:56,388 --> 00:00:59,975
<i>The little boy was afraid, but he trusted
his father and did what he was told,</i>

9
00:01:00,017 --> 00:01:02,603
<i>and jumped into his arms.</i>

10
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:05,272
<i>The father put him on the next step,
and then the next,</i>

11
00:01:05,314 --> 00:01:08,317
<i>each time telling him,
"Jump, and I'll catch you. "</i>

12
00:01:09,485 --> 00:01:12,530
<i>Then the boy jumped
from a very high step,</i>

13
00:01:12,571 --> 00:01:17,701
<i>but this time, the father stepped back
and the boy fell flat on his face.</i>

14
00:01:18,702 --> 00:01:21,914
<i>He picked himself up,
bleeding and crying,</i>

15
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:25,126
<i>and the father said to him,
"That'll teach you. "</i>

16
00:01:25,835 --> 00:01:28,170
-Here, put this sweater on.
-Nuh-uh.

17
00:01:28,212 --> 00:01:31,674
Don't be ridiculous! You're shaking
like a bowl of Jell-O. Put the sweater on!

18
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,301
-Mom!
-Oh, for God's sake!

19
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:57,992
<i>-I betrothe you to me...
-I betrothe you to me...</i>

20
00:01:58,033 --> 00:02:00,369
<i>...with this ring...
... with this ring...</i>

21
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:02,997
<i>...according
to the Jewish law.</i>

22
00:02:03,038 --> 00:02:10,379
<i>I betrothe you to me
according to the Jewish law.</i>

23
00:02:10,379 --> 00:02:16,761
I betroth you to me forever
in righteousness and justice,

24
00:02:16,802 --> 00:02:21,807
in kindness and in mercy
and you shall know God.

25
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:24,268
For you.

26
00:03:01,305 --> 00:03:02,681
Ahh!

27
00:03:02,723 --> 00:03:05,142
Aargh!

28
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,648
Well, I'm dying.

29
00:03:10,689 --> 00:03:13,984
You're not dying. You had an episode
and they want to watch you.

30
00:03:14,026 --> 00:03:15,569
<i>-Have a nice weekend.
-Hm?</i>

31
00:03:15,611 --> 00:03:17,571
-She's always dying.
-Why are you rushing?

32
00:03:17,613 --> 00:03:19,949
Sorry, rounds took forever. Sorry I'm late.

33
00:03:19,949 --> 00:03:21,450
Oh, baby, no problem.

34
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,702
-Have a good evening.
-Thank you.

35
00:03:23,744 --> 00:03:27,164
You're late for Shabbat and you have to
tell this stranger our private business?

36
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,958
Mom, you're lucky we come at all.

37
00:03:28,999 --> 00:03:31,752
I'm lucky you come to Shabbat?
Why is that? Stop eating.

38
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:34,547
Cos it's the 21st century,
cos we're not in Babylon.

39
00:03:34,588 --> 00:03:37,550
We don't have to remind ourselves
to let our land lie fallow

40
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:41,178
-The whole point of Shabbat is...
-I was eleven minutes late!

41
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,555
You're getting worked up,

42
00:03:42,596 --> 00:03:45,474
and being worked up all the time
never got anyone pregnant.

43
00:03:45,516 --> 00:03:47,893
We've been trying for 10 months!

44
00:03:47,935 --> 00:03:50,855
-Where does everyone have to get to?
-I'm not worked up!

45
00:03:50,896 --> 00:03:53,274
I would just like very much to have a baby.

46
00:03:53,315 --> 00:03:54,942
-So adopt.
-Who's really mine.

47
00:04:18,340 --> 00:04:19,800
<i># Blessed are You #</i>

48
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:23,304

<i># Our God, King of the universe #</i>

50
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,728
Adopt a baby, for God's sake,

51
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:34,440
-You're 39 years old!
-That's what you did.

52
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:38,110
That's why you can't do it, because I did it?
Being like me is such a...

53
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,196
-There's a feeling.
-No, there's not!

54
00:04:40,237 --> 00:04:42,323
When he was little, I watched you.

55
00:04:42,364 --> 00:04:45,159
I watched you... watch him.

56
00:04:45,201 --> 00:04:49,163
I saw you look at each other.
It was different.

57
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:51,665
I want that.

58
00:04:56,837 --> 00:04:58,255
You listen to me.

59
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:03,219
There's no difference.

60
00:05:11,352 --> 00:05:12,686
Are you here?

61
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,650
Where are you?

62
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:19,026
I'm in here.

63
00:05:21,278 --> 00:05:24,365
Sweetie, can you come in here
and sit down for a minute?

64
00:05:24,406 --> 00:05:26,158
I'll be there in one second.

65
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:31,288
Hi.

66
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,665
Sit down.

67
00:05:32,706 --> 00:05:34,291
You stand up.

68
00:05:35,418 --> 00:05:37,128
Sweetie, please sit down.

69
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:39,588
And take your coat off.

70
00:05:39,588 --> 00:05:41,507
Maybe you should take it off.

71
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,763
Well?

72
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,517
I made a mistake.

73
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,770
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,815
I made a mistake.

75
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,319
You made what?

76
00:06:02,361 --> 00:06:05,614
If I could blink my eyes
and it would be a year from now...

77
00:06:07,032 --> 00:06:10,119
and we could be friends, best friends,
I would do it.

78
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:15,624
We teach across the hall from each other.

79
00:06:16,792 --> 00:06:19,128
I'll see you all the time, every day.

80
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,715
But listen, I want...

81
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:27,762
-I want you to know something.
-Do you want?

82
00:06:27,803 --> 00:06:29,263
Yeah, thank you.

83
00:06:33,184 --> 00:06:35,227
What did you want me to know?

84
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,773
I'm 100 percent sure.

85
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,986
Is it because I didn't say the right thing
the other night?

86
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,989
-If you wanna pursue this drawing thing...
-It's nothing.

87
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:49,158
-I just meant that if...
-I'm attracted to...

88
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,951
...somebody has to make some money.

89
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,536
I don't...

90
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:56,749
-I can't make love if we don't talk.
-I don't, I don't want this life!

91
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:05,174
Don't you want to take your coat off?

92
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,137
Why don't you want to take your coat off?

93
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:18,938
Oh, God!

94
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:53,681
I'm really sure we shouldn't...

95
00:09:14,762 --> 00:09:16,639
I'll see you in school.

96
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,401
Come on.

97
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,791
Can you explain this to me?

98
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:29,378
Mrs. Epner Green, this is chaos.
Who's in charge?

99
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,715
-It says he has resigned.
-And you knew nothing about this?

100
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:34,717
If Mr. Green is out,
why is there no substitute?

101
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:36,260
Is he coming in?

102
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:39,805
Mrs. Epner Green's class,
make space for Mr. Green's class.

103
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:42,433
Mrs. Epner Green,
this is way too many kids for one room!

104
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,477
Really, d'you think so?

105
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,980
-Well, Mrs. Epner Green
-Ms. Epner.

106
00:10:48,063 --> 00:10:52,693
OK, the parents can go.
Mr. Green will not be coming in.

107
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:55,696
Ms. Epner will be teaching both classes.

108
00:10:55,738 --> 00:10:57,865
You don't know where he is?

109
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,118
Have you slept?

110
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:06,582
Don't do anything until you've slept.

111
00:11:06,624 --> 00:11:09,293
Don't think anything until you've slept.

112
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:12,588
I have to drop her upstairs.

113
00:11:12,588 --> 00:11:15,591
It's gonna take me an hour to get a sub.

114
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,051
Love you.

115
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,137
Can you watch them for five minutes?

116
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:22,389
Go. Hurry back.

117
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,496
Don't let anyone fix you up with anyone.

118
00:11:46,664 --> 00:11:50,251
A friend of mine set me up on a date,
I'm still recovering.

119
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:53,796
Are you... coming on to me?

120
00:11:55,256 --> 00:11:57,091
What?

121
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,009
My husband left me nine hours ago.

122
00:11:59,051 --> 00:12:02,138
Do you think you could control yourself
for five minutes?

123
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:06,892
You betcha.

124
00:12:11,981 --> 00:12:13,649
Oh, my God!

125
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:18,654
OK. You should come in.
This is bad timing

126
00:12:18,696 --> 00:12:20,906
-Do you know how old I am?
-Yes, I do.

127
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,908
I want a baby. I can't explain it.

128
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:26,620
It's like being hungry or having to pee.
Please don't tell me to adopt.

129
00:12:26,662 --> 00:12:29,290
I wouldn't. I won't. I never will.

130
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:37,882
A 65-year-old lady in the Bronx
just gave birth to twins.

131
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,135
-So... I mean, not that that's...
-Thanks.

132
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:43,679
-Should I come in?
-Yes, you should come in. I just need...

133
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,389
Hi, I'm here.

134
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:47,558
Sorry.

135
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,311

136
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:54,148
Thanks.

137
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:56,734
-I'm gonna go.
-April, don't go home alone.

138
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,736
It's fine. I need to sleep.

139
00:12:59,737 --> 00:13:01,822

She's, she's well known.
She really wants to meet you,

<i>" I believe the time has come
for us to meet.</i>

172
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:51,158
<i>" Let's have lunch tomorrow, Saturday,
you and me. Barbetta Restaurant at one.</i>

173
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,286
<i>"Your mother, Bernice. "</i>

174
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:58,791
<i>Good afternoon.
Can I help you, miss?</i>

175
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:03,462
Oh, hello. Do you happen to have
a reservation for someone named Bernice?

176
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:07,675
<i>Yes, of course we do.
Right this way, please.</i>

177
00:16:10,428 --> 00:16:12,430
A glass of champagne while you wait?

178
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,560
Do you have a ladies room?

179
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,319
<i>-Hello, beautiful.
-Oh!</i>

180
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,655
Thank you.

181
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,668
I'm a... teacher.

182
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:55,139
...sounds like Judy Holliday.
You get anyone besides her, hang up.

183
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:57,808
You won't get in
unless you use my name, right?

184
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,644
I know, it's terrible,
but we're talking about your health.

185
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,313
<i>-Thank you very much.
-Mm.</i>

186
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:15,451
Let me just look at you.

187
00:17:24,126 --> 00:17:26,587
-You're magnificent!
-What's your name?

188
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,090
Oh, thank you.
Um, what is your name?

189
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,966
-You got my letter.
-Uh, your last name?

190
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,260
Oh, Graves.
I'm so happy you don't know it.

191
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:35,971
-Why would I...
-How do you feel right now?

192
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,348
How do you feel?

193
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:42,144
I feel like you are the reward for
everything I ever did right in my entire life.

194
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,356
-Oh!
-And how do you feel?

195
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,317
I, um... Thank you.

196
00:17:48,359 --> 00:17:51,403
I'm wondering how you can be certain
you're actually my mother.

197
00:17:51,445 --> 00:17:54,907
Are you married?
I mean, do you have anyone?

198
00:17:54,949 --> 00:17:58,452
Someone who takes you in his arms
or her arms.

199
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,287
God knows
I only want you to be happy.

200
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,914
Someone who holds you in the night?

201
00:18:01,956 --> 00:18:03,791
-You didn't answer...
-Doesn't matter.

202
00:18:03,833 --> 00:18:07,169
Some of the richest periods of my life
came when I was between love affairs.

203
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:09,964
-Were you raised with brothers or sisters?
-I have a brother.

204
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:11,632
Oh, I wanna meet him.

205
00:18:11,674 --> 00:18:13,467
-It's a little soon...
-Hello, you two.

206
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,846
-Oh, Alan, you remember Gabrielle.
-It's April.

207
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:19,765
Recovering from the abominable way
I approached you?

208
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:23,185
I make for you a special
mother/daughter antipasto.

209
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:25,855
Someday I'll tell you
how we have Alan to thank for this.

210
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,940
I uh, I produced the show that led to this.

211
00:18:27,982 --> 00:18:31,652
I looked in the camera and
the whole story just came out. Our story.

212
00:18:31,694 --> 00:18:35,072
-Such a powerful moment.
-Excuse me, what is our story?

213
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,074
-I'm sorry to bother you.
-That's all right.

214
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:39,869
-Alan, do you have a pen?
-No, I just want to say, I love you.

215
00:18:39,910 --> 00:18:41,287
I watch you all the time.

216
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:43,956
I think you're just the best.
Enjoy your lunch.

217
00:18:43,998 --> 00:18:45,332
Thank you.

218
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,835
If you have a TV show,
why have I never heard of you?

219
00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,837
You watch local TV
at 10:30 in the morning?

220
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,630
-Never.
-Me, either.

221
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,758
How much do you know about
my parents?

222
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,926
I know that you lost Trudy
three weeks ago,

223
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,179
and you lost Julius
three years before that.

224
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,223
-How do you know who they were?
-Oh, I've known since the day I lost you.

225
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:02,850
-Were they good to you?
-How?

226
00:19:02,892 --> 00:19:04,977
-You weren't allowed to know that.
-I read it.

227
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:07,938
Upside down,
across the adoption counsellor's desk.

228
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,149
"Baby Girl Epner, born April first. "

229
00:19:10,191 --> 00:19:11,650
So, it's possible.

230
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,736
-What?
-That you are who you say you are.

231
00:19:13,778 --> 00:19:15,821
Listen, I only got to have you
for three days,

232
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,616
but that doesn't change the fact
that you are my daughter.

233
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,118
You are the most important thing on earth
to me.

234
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,537
You must know that.
Do you have children?

235
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:27,291
I think your own family might feel strange
about you tracking me down like this.

236
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,502
My family is me and you.

237
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:32,671
It shows in your face
that you know I'm your mother.

238
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:35,299
-What about your husband?
-Oh, I don't have one.

239
00:19:35,341 --> 00:19:37,259
What about you -
ever been married?

240
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:38,636
-Yes.
-How's that going?

241
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,889
-Y'know, there's a certain presumption...
-Don't lock Bernice out.

242
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:44,600
-She loved the people who raised her.
-You're her mother.

243
00:19:44,642 --> 00:19:47,645
-But it's natural she would have questions.
-I'm sitting here!

244
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,319
Yes, you are.

245
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:56,737
Ask me anything.

246
00:19:57,738 --> 00:20:01,951
You're sitting on anger. Ask me anything,
hit hard, ask me anything you want.

247
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,620
Why did you give me up?

248
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:11,544
"On you will go,
though the weather be foul.

249
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:14,422
"On you will go,
though your enemies prowl.

250
00:20:14,463 --> 00:20:16,674
"Onward up many a frightening creek

251
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:20,469
"Though your arms may get sore
and your sneakers may leak. "

252
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:25,099
-What?
-It's a book, by Dr. Seuss.

253
00:20:25,141 --> 00:20:27,351
-Did your adoptive parents read it to you?
-No.

254
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:31,147
Oh, that's a shame,
because it's a map of your life really.

255
00:20:31,188 --> 00:20:34,817
The whole point of which
is that every ending is a beginning.

256
00:20:34,859 --> 00:20:38,237
Now, when Trudy and Julius passed,
that was an ending,

257
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:43,743
but in a funny kind of a silver liningy way,
it's brought us together, hasn't it?

258
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:45,995
I have to go.

259
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,205
Wait. Stop.

260
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,708
Don't... Don't go.

261
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,627
-Gabrielle!
-April, goddammit!

262
00:20:56,297 --> 00:20:59,633
Would you like to know
who your father was?

263
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,677
He was a famous man, now dead.

264
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,308
Why don't we go to my office
and really talk?

265
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,435
-Thank you, no.
-We could go for a drive.

266
00:21:09,477 --> 00:21:11,729
-I would like to walk.
-Oh, you like to walk?

267
00:21:11,771 --> 00:21:13,105
You sound like your father.

268
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:15,399
My famous father, now dead,
went for walks?

269
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:19,820
I'm a walker myself, you know.
All kinds of exercise, I'm a nut for.

270
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,697
Could we slow down for just a moment?

271
00:21:22,865 --> 00:21:26,452
Oh, being related like this
is just incredible.

272
00:21:26,494 --> 00:21:28,454
You were saying about my father?

273
00:21:28,496 --> 00:21:29,914
You hardly know me yet.

274
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,458
Well, thank you, Ms. Graves,

275
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,878
it was traumatic and
potentially illuminating to have met you.

276
00:21:37,588 --> 00:21:39,465
I met him when I was fifteen.

277
00:21:39,507 --> 00:21:41,926
-I worked in perfume.
-Where, exactly?

278
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:44,220
Well, four blocks that way,
as it happens.

279
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,722
Used to be Bonwit Teller.
You can look it up.

280
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:50,351
Since I wasn't rich, I earned extra money
working in their perfume department.

281
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:53,729
-So this was a customer?
-Oh, a very special customer.

282
00:21:53,771 --> 00:21:57,650
He came in to buy a gift for his mother.
He was close to his mother, too close,

283
00:21:57,691 --> 00:22:00,069
-because no woman could measure up.
-Who was it?

284
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:03,072
He was immediately flirtatious,
but not in a boorish way.

285
00:22:03,114 --> 00:22:07,493
He was, and I say this in all humility...
enchanted.

286
00:22:07,535 --> 00:22:09,995
-Who was it?
-Steve McQueen.

287
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,250
-How dare you.
-We were deeply in love.

288
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:15,668
Well, what went wrong?

289
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:17,795
He was single when I met him.
Separated, anyway.

290
00:22:17,837 --> 00:22:21,006
I never would've gotten involved
had his relationship been viable,

291
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:23,175
but I sensed they weren't through.

292
00:22:23,217 --> 00:22:25,678
"They" would be Steve McQueen
and Ali MacGraw?

293
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:30,266
If you watch The Getaway, you'll sense
a certain closeness. I feel good about that.

294
00:22:30,307 --> 00:22:32,518
By the way, do you have any children?

295
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:35,646
-Was it a one-night stand?
-Oh, the memory lasted a lifetime.

296
00:22:37,064 --> 00:22:39,024
Your generation is so cynical.

297
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,402
-When was I conceived?
-Around the fourth of July.

298
00:22:41,444 --> 00:22:42,611
-Around or on?
-On!

299
00:22:42,653 --> 00:22:45,322
-Was he right or left handed?
-What kind of question is that?

300
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,365
Circumcised?

301
00:22:46,407 --> 00:22:48,659
Catholic.
I understand your parents were Jewish.

302
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,244
-So what? So am I.
-Well, God bless.

303
00:22:50,286 --> 00:22:52,830
-What does that mean?
-God bless that you believe in God.

304
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:57,001
-You don't believe in God?
-I don't know. Watched the news lately?

305
00:22:57,042 --> 00:23:00,588
I'll ask you one more time,
why did you give me up?

306
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:03,090
I didn't give you up.
You were taken from me.

307
00:23:04,383 --> 00:23:05,801
Didn't they tell you that?

308
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,680
My father was very religious.

309
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:13,726
I held you in my arms for three days,
praying that it wouldn't happen.

310
00:23:13,768 --> 00:23:15,102
But it did.

311
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:18,856
He walked in, he took you,
and he left me screaming.

312
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:21,150
How do I know any of this is true?

313
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:23,110
Because it is!

314
00:23:24,487 --> 00:23:29,617
All right, listen to me,
and please respect what I say to you.

315
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:35,206
I have to go home, think about this,
and decide what to believe.

316
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:36,749
OK.

317
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:39,085
OK.

318
00:23:40,503 --> 00:23:41,837
Thank you.

319
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:46,175
-I appreciate you...
-Can you drop me?

320
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,220
What? Where?

321
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,930
Back there.

322
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,681
All right.

323
00:24:07,071 --> 00:24:08,697
When can we do this again?

324
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,119
Everyone needs family.

325
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:19,041
I will call you.

326
00:24:19,083 --> 00:24:21,293
Let me give you my number.
Do you have a pen?

327
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:26,632
OK.

328
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:28,300
Give me your hand.

329
00:24:29,385 --> 00:24:30,886
Please?

330
00:24:40,312 --> 00:24:42,022
It's harder to lose a hand.

331
00:24:53,451 --> 00:24:56,245
<i>This isn't just
a thousand-to-one shot.</i>

332
00:24:56,287 --> 00:24:59,290
<i>This is a professional blood sport.</i>

333
00:24:59,331 --> 00:25:01,167
<i>It can happen to you.</i>

334
00:25:02,168 --> 00:25:04,044
<i>And then it can happen to you again.</i>

335
00:25:07,423 --> 00:25:09,133
I want my mommy!

336
00:25:09,175 --> 00:25:12,052
Hi, everybody.
Thanks for your patience.

337
00:25:12,052 --> 00:25:16,599
-Oh, some more than others.
-I want my mommy! I want my mommy!

338
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,809
Ruby, I need you to come here now.
Get your shoes on.

339
00:25:18,851 --> 00:25:22,229
Why don't you come in first?
I mean, for obvious reasons.

340
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:25,191
That's OK. You go ahead.
Besides, we're having so much fun here.

341
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:27,359
-Are you sure?
-Of nothing.

342
00:25:27,401 --> 00:25:29,945
I want my mommy!

343
00:25:44,251 --> 00:25:45,878
-Pardon me.
-What!

344
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,713
We're all right. We're fine.

345
00:25:47,755 --> 00:25:51,717
-You're fine? She's fine?
-Yeah, we're fine. Mm-hm, fine.

346
00:25:57,765 --> 00:26:00,851
-Listen, I'm sorry about what I...
-Shh.

347
00:26:03,104 --> 00:26:04,939
I'm sorry about what I said to you.

348
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,818
Listen, I'm four weeks divorced.
For all I know, I was coming on to you.

349
00:26:10,945 --> 00:26:12,571
Were you coming on to me?

350
00:26:12,613 --> 00:26:14,073
No, I wasn't.

351
00:26:15,282 --> 00:26:16,784
Why I wasn't, I can't imagine.

352
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:23,958
Um, this is Jimmy Ray's portfolio.

353
00:26:23,999 --> 00:26:26,752
-I think he's in trouble.
-You do?

354
00:26:28,129 --> 00:26:30,798
-Sorry, what were you about to say?
-His printing is good.

355
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:32,091
-Really?
-Mm-hm.

356
00:26:32,133 --> 00:26:34,593
K's made him nervous,
but he likes them now.

357
00:26:34,635 --> 00:26:36,762
-He seems happiest...
-He has night terrors.

358
00:26:36,804 --> 00:26:39,932
-Did you say night terrors?
-I think they're night terrors.

359
00:26:39,974 --> 00:26:42,601
-He walks in his sleep.
-How often?

360
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:44,770
Once, ten months ago.

361
00:26:44,812 --> 00:26:47,398
-What happened?
-He peed in the fridge.

362
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,899
Have you slept?

363
00:26:48,983 --> 00:26:51,777
Oh, no. No.

364
00:26:55,239 --> 00:26:56,574
I love his hands.

365
00:26:57,908 --> 00:27:03,330
I do. I love how he uses them,
how expressive he is.

366
00:27:03,330 --> 00:27:04,707
I love that, too.

367
00:27:04,749 --> 00:27:07,460
He has a little less confidence
just right at the moment,

368
00:27:07,501 --> 00:27:10,129
-but I think that's to be expected.
-Do you have kids?

369
00:27:12,047 --> 00:27:13,382
No.

370
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:17,970
He talks about his mom a lot.
He seems to worship her.

371
00:27:18,012 --> 00:27:20,556
From afar.
She's on a trip round the world.

372
00:27:20,598 --> 00:27:23,350
She's a painter. She's painting the world
with her boyfriend.

373
00:27:23,392 --> 00:27:24,727
Oh.

374
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,774
I see you outside in your car. Is that...

375
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:32,318
Yes. I work out there. I write.

376
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,527
In your car?

377
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:35,780
I like to keep an eye on the building.
It relaxes me.

378
00:27:35,821 --> 00:27:37,573
Mm.

379
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:39,450
So why didn't you have kids?

380
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,661
I've watched you. You love them.
And you're...

381
00:27:42,703 --> 00:27:44,080
Old?

382
00:27:44,121 --> 00:27:45,456
No.

383
00:27:46,415 --> 00:27:49,668
No, my God, no. You can't be
more than what, you're 35, 34?

384
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:52,505
I'm 39 and a half years old
and I've never been pregnant.

385
00:27:52,546 --> 00:27:54,048
Well, if you put it like that.

386
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:58,010
-It looks pretty bleak, doesn't it?
-No. No, it looks painful.

387
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,848
And beautiful.

388
00:28:03,724 --> 00:28:05,851
And I hope you get everything you want.

389
00:28:12,316 --> 00:28:13,901
Um, dinner.

390
00:28:14,944 --> 00:28:16,612
Apparently I want dinner.

391
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,494
-Well, bon appétit.
-Oh, would you like to get some dinner?

392
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:26,497
No, I'd rather eat frozen food alone
for the fifteenth month in a row.

393
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:27,915
Yes, I'd like to get dinner.

394
00:28:27,957 --> 00:28:31,001
But I think
you are a very beautiful woman

395
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:35,923
and for some reason I decided not to go
on any kind of date for at least a year.

396
00:28:35,965 --> 00:28:38,551
Why? Because I'm a fucking idiot.

397
00:28:38,592 --> 00:28:41,720
Thank you, you're gorgeous.
I'm leaving now.

398
00:28:50,604 --> 00:28:52,231
Yes, I would like to get some dinner.

399
00:28:55,276 --> 00:28:58,028
-Best friends? He said that?
-Mm-hm.

400
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,072
Is this man entirely intact?

401
00:29:00,114 --> 00:29:03,534
You know, we were best friends.
I loved him.

402
00:29:03,576 --> 00:29:06,746
Kept hoping one day, pop,
he'd be a grown-up.

403
00:29:07,788 --> 00:29:09,623
So your wife was seeing someone else?

404
00:29:09,665 --> 00:29:11,375
Pretty much everyone else.

405
00:29:11,417 --> 00:29:13,127
I was too much for her.

406
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:14,837
-For your wife?
-Mm-hm.

407
00:29:14,879 --> 00:29:16,547
I'm sure she didn't feel that way.

408
00:29:16,589 --> 00:29:18,257
-She told me.
-What did she say?

409
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,050
"You're too much for me. "

410
00:29:20,092 --> 00:29:22,970
Ohh! So was it just out of the blue?

411
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,974
It was out of the blue
because I was an idiot.

412
00:29:27,016 --> 00:29:29,769
I came across the ocean
to be a blind idiot.

413
00:29:30,978 --> 00:29:34,815
This woman may actually let her kids
grow up without knowing their mother.

414
00:29:34,857 --> 00:29:36,400
I hope not.

415
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:39,987
How can you know
if someone's your mother?

416
00:29:40,988 --> 00:29:45,743
I mean, literally, if someone says they're
your mother, how can you know for sure?

417
00:29:45,785 --> 00:29:47,453
DNA test, I guess. Why?

418
00:30:01,759 --> 00:30:04,053
I mean, you don't not look like
Steve McQueen.

419
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:07,973
-Is she a credible person?
-I have no idea.

420
00:30:10,518 --> 00:30:13,521
My God, you have a chance
to get to know your mother.

421
00:30:15,606 --> 00:30:17,149
Yes, I guess I do.

422
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,362
What do you write in here?

423
00:30:21,403 --> 00:30:22,863
Books.

424
00:30:23,864 --> 00:30:28,828
Jackets. Jackets for other people's books.
For now.

425
00:30:42,716 --> 00:30:44,927
-Get a hair.
-I'm sorry?

426
00:30:44,969 --> 00:30:47,179
For the DNA test. Get a hair.

427
00:30:47,221 --> 00:30:48,597
Oh.

428
00:30:49,807 --> 00:30:51,142
Thank you.

429
00:30:54,395 --> 00:30:55,771
Well.

430
00:30:57,648 --> 00:31:00,234
-I don't wanna say good night.
-I don't either.

431
00:31:01,277 --> 00:31:02,736
Uh-oh.

432
00:31:04,864 --> 00:31:08,075
You suppose my son would notice if I just
didn't pick him up from his play day?

433
00:31:08,117 --> 00:31:09,869
I'm sure he'd understand.

434
00:31:14,874 --> 00:31:16,709
OK, I need you to do something for me.

435
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:18,711
I need you to get in your car.
Which is your car?

436
00:31:19,545 --> 00:31:23,132
Yeah, I need you to get in your car
and drive away, first. Because I can't.

437
00:31:23,174 --> 00:31:24,717
Will you do that for me?

438
00:31:24,759 --> 00:31:26,218
-Seriously?
-Yes.

439
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:30,389
You will go home, right?

440
00:31:30,431 --> 00:31:33,851
I won't find you guys here in the morning
wearing the same thing?

441
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:40,065
-OK. Good night.
-Good night.

442
00:31:43,527 --> 00:31:46,906
Maybe I should call you when you
get home, just so you can be sure.

443
00:31:49,116 --> 00:31:53,037
I'd appreciate that. I worry.

444
00:31:53,079 --> 00:31:54,497
Yeah, I do, too.

445
00:31:57,541 --> 00:31:59,126
What are you making?

446
00:31:59,168 --> 00:32:01,754
Well, it's peanut butter and jelly.
And I have to confess

447
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:04,548
that we don't share your countrymen's love
of peanut butter.

448
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:10,221
And jelly isn't jelly. That's another thing
I have to have a word with you about.

449
00:32:11,305 --> 00:32:14,266
Well, if you were in England,
what would you be making?

450
00:32:14,308 --> 00:32:16,727
This would probably be
cheese and pickle.

451
00:32:16,769 --> 00:32:18,896
Did you say cheese and pickle?

452
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:20,272
You don't know what pickle is.

453
00:32:20,272 --> 00:32:22,566
You give me a hard time
about peanut butter and jelly

454
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:23,901
and you say cheese and pickle?

455
00:32:23,943 --> 00:32:28,739
I'm defending food to an Englishman.
Is that happening to me right now?

456
00:32:28,781 --> 00:32:33,035
Our sex life was dominated
by her artwork, you know?

457
00:32:33,077 --> 00:32:34,495
What do you mean?

458
00:32:34,537 --> 00:32:37,581
Well, she liked to depict acts
of autoeroticism.

459
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:39,458
Oh.

460
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:46,590
I sometimes make toast and have tea
after I've brushed my teeth,

461
00:32:46,632 --> 00:32:49,969
and I don't brush them again.
Do you ever do that?

462
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:54,807
No, no, no, I can't.
I'm, um, I'm British.

463
00:32:54,849 --> 00:32:57,601
<i>#... beautiful girl and I want you to know it #</i>

464
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:04,775
I was never happier to get a call.

465
00:33:04,817 --> 00:33:08,529
-Hello.
-Hello. Have you eaten yet?

466
00:33:08,571 --> 00:33:11,490
-Um, actually, no.
-Oh, come with me!

467
00:33:12,241 --> 00:33:15,244
Our show went well today,
despite our best efforts,

468
00:33:15,286 --> 00:33:17,538
so, everyone's in a good mood, OK?
AJ?

469
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,373
-Welcome to the craziness.
-Hello.

470
00:33:19,415 --> 00:33:21,000
-Lunch?
-Please. We're famished.

471
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:22,626
-Sam's?
-Perfect!

472
00:33:22,668 --> 00:33:25,045
What do you feel like?
It's a kind of a pubby place.

473
00:33:25,087 --> 00:33:27,339
Would a hamburger be all right?

474
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:29,300
-Oh, my God!
-What?

475
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:32,303
You're a little anaemic, aren't you?

476
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,763
Runs in the family.

477
00:33:33,804 --> 00:33:36,098
Actually, I would just like a hamburger.

478
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:39,351
Oh. OK. Come on.

479
00:33:39,393 --> 00:33:42,730
So, Janeane Garofolo, you've lived
in the West Village for a long time,

480
00:33:42,772 --> 00:33:46,609
what's it like when the denizens of the
village come out and march about?

481
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:47,985
-In Gay Pride?
-Yes.

482
00:33:48,027 --> 00:33:49,945
I have a particular favorite gay.

483
00:33:49,987 --> 00:33:51,572
-You do?
-I do.

484
00:33:51,614 --> 00:33:56,202
My favorite gay is the bantamweight
Latino in the gold lamé short shorts.

485
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:59,789
Lace front short shorts.

486
00:33:59,830 --> 00:34:02,541
-I'm partial to the flyweight Latino.
-Do you know his name?

487
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:04,460
I don't know. but he's great on the float.

488
00:34:04,502 --> 00:34:06,712
...surf break up on the Statue of Liberty,

489
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:10,549
so that you could actually ride a wave
from the Statue of Liberty to Battery Park.

490
00:34:10,591 --> 00:34:12,676
-That would be great.
-That would be great.

491
00:34:12,718 --> 00:34:14,887
Instead of taking that ferry.

492
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:18,849
-Come on in.
-A hamburger is eighteen dollars!

493
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:21,143
My treat. Make it two.

494
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:24,146
-I'll have a Caesar salad.
-One sec.

495
00:34:27,691 --> 00:34:29,318
I can't have you in this lunch.

496
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:31,612
Well, if you can't have me here,
you can't have me.

497
00:34:31,654 --> 00:34:33,781
Thanks.

498
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:43,582
I practically live in this room
In fact, I call it my sanctuary.

499
00:34:43,624 --> 00:34:46,502
-Do you have a sanctuary?
-My kitchen is nice.

500
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:49,213
Let me show you something.

501
00:34:54,802 --> 00:34:56,137
Come here.

502
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,979
I want you to know me.

503
00:35:06,439 --> 00:35:07,773
OK.

504
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:11,235
Much of this is my natural hair color.

505
00:35:13,571 --> 00:35:17,116
OK, I'll start. Much of this
is my natural hair color.

506
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:21,746
Oh! Um...

507
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:25,249
I don't know what to...
I like music.

508
00:35:25,291 --> 00:35:28,461
-What kind of music?
-I like Fleetwood Mac and um...

509
00:35:28,502 --> 00:35:30,296
I'm very verbal during sex.

510
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:33,966
I'm afraid of drowning.

511
00:35:33,966 --> 00:35:36,719
-During sex?
-No, just in general.

512
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:39,764
Um, I'm a tiny bit hard of hearing
in my right ear.

513
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,974
I'm a tiny bit hard of hearing
in my right ear.

514
00:35:42,016 --> 00:35:44,310
Oh, see? What else?

515
00:35:45,311 --> 00:35:47,188
I visit my father's grave all the time.

516
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:49,815
-Only his?
-What? Of course not. Both.

517
00:35:49,857 --> 00:35:51,192
Oh, of course.

518
00:35:52,151 --> 00:35:53,986
Three years ago, I had a lumpectomy.

519
00:35:54,028 --> 00:35:57,114
-Oh?
-Oh, I was fine. But you should be aware.

520
00:35:57,156 --> 00:36:00,618
-I'm getting a divorce.
-Oh, God, I knew it!

521
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:02,995
I could feel it. I'm so connected to you.

522
00:36:02,995 --> 00:36:05,498
-What happened?
-I don't wanna talk about it.

523
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:08,501
-But you brought it up.
-I was playing your game and it came out.

524
00:36:08,542 --> 00:36:09,794
-Was this recent?
-Yes.

525
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:12,171
-Was there trouble for a long time?
-Long enough.

526
00:36:12,213 --> 00:36:14,673
Do you still want kids?
Of course you still want kids.

527
00:36:14,715 --> 00:36:16,467
-May I use this?
-Oh, yes, of course.

528
00:36:16,509 --> 00:36:18,928
Here, let me have it.
Let's see.

529
00:36:22,056 --> 00:36:23,390
I'll clean it out for you.

530
00:36:23,432 --> 00:36:25,935
There you go.
What's mine is yours.

531
00:36:32,817 --> 00:36:34,777
I want to find this record to play for you.

532
00:36:36,278 --> 00:36:39,365
It's Roy Orbison
singing All I Have To Do Is Dream.

533
00:36:39,407 --> 00:36:43,327
It's very rare.
But when I was pregnant with you,

534
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:45,454
I played it all the time, and I thought...

535
00:36:52,795 --> 00:36:54,130
Oh.

536
00:36:57,049 --> 00:37:00,386
Ohh, I can feel your heart beating.

537
00:37:01,345 --> 00:37:02,680
Me, too.

538
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:07,268
The last time I felt your heart
beating against mine,

539
00:37:07,309 --> 00:37:09,311
you were three days old.

540
00:37:09,353 --> 00:37:10,813
How big was I?

541
00:37:10,855 --> 00:37:13,858
Six pounds, 15 ounces. Mm!

542
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:18,487
You had such a sweet face and
the squinchiest little eyes and... Ow!

543
00:37:18,529 --> 00:37:22,032
Oh, what was that?

544
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:24,952
I don't know.

545
00:37:32,168 --> 00:37:36,005
-Hi, there.
-Oh, hello.

546
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:39,258
Hi.

547
00:37:39,258 --> 00:37:43,262
Hi. OK. Let's everybody pack up.

548
00:37:43,304 --> 00:37:44,638
Hello.

549
00:37:49,351 --> 00:37:50,686
Did I do something wrong?

550
00:37:50,728 --> 00:37:52,605
No... of course not.

551
00:37:53,647 --> 00:37:54,982
Hello.

552
00:37:56,776 --> 00:37:59,862
I've very much enjoyed talking to you
these last nights,

553
00:37:59,904 --> 00:38:04,075
but we shouldn't go out of our way to talk
to each other here, in a private way.

554
00:38:04,116 --> 00:38:06,285
-In a private way?
-I've thought about it...

555
00:38:06,327 --> 00:38:07,745
I've thought about it, too.

556
00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:09,121
Let's go, Daddy.

557
00:38:09,121 --> 00:38:12,249
OK. Well, good night.

558
00:38:12,291 --> 00:38:14,335
Um... goodbye.

559
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,134
One thing.

560
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:27,848
I don't sleep, usually, so if you want to
look up information about your mother,

561
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:29,433
I'd be happy to help.

562
00:38:29,475 --> 00:38:31,519
Oh, boy, I am so bad at that stuff.

563
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,063
-At some point I...
-Here.

564
00:38:34,105 --> 00:38:35,564
It's about Steve McQueen.

565
00:38:35,606 --> 00:38:37,608
What about him?

566
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,819
I got your birth date from the office.

567
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:44,490
Listen, I have to do something with the
energy I'm spending not asking you out.

568
00:38:44,532 --> 00:38:45,866
Do you wanna know?

569
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:50,121
Steve McQueen was on the Yangtze River,
it's in Southern China,

570
00:38:50,162 --> 00:38:51,831
making a film called The Sand Pebbles.

571
00:38:51,872 --> 00:38:55,584
He was there between March, 1966,
and September.

572
00:38:55,626 --> 00:38:57,586
-You were born in April?
-Yes.

573
00:38:58,587 --> 00:39:01,132
Is it possible this could've happened
in Southern China?

574
00:39:01,173 --> 00:39:03,217
She told me Manhattan.

575
00:39:04,927 --> 00:39:07,346
Sorry, I just don't think he could've been.

576
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:11,851
I don't know who you are or what you
want, but I want you to stay away from me.

577
00:39:11,892 --> 00:39:15,354
How dare you invade the life
of another human being this way?

578
00:39:15,396 --> 00:39:20,860
What kind of selfish, psychotic,
compassionless freak must you be?

579
00:39:20,901 --> 00:39:25,740
Do not ever try to contact me again
or I will call the police, I swear to God!

580
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:33,873
-Freddy?
-You sitting down?

581
00:39:33,914 --> 00:39:35,249
Yes.

582
00:39:35,291 --> 00:39:36,625
<i>She's your mother.</i>

583
00:39:37,460 --> 00:39:39,670
-Begin.
-I know what a risk this is for you.

584
00:39:39,712 --> 00:39:41,046
You have no idea.

585
00:39:41,046 --> 00:39:43,924
And nothing could possibly excuse
my having told you a lie.

586
00:39:43,966 --> 00:39:45,468
Begin!

587
00:39:45,509 --> 00:39:47,178
His name was Jack Watske.

588
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:49,221
He was a Ukrainian boy
from the neighborhood.

589
00:39:49,263 --> 00:39:51,182
A little gangly, but gorgeous.

590
00:39:51,223 --> 00:39:54,518
Did you ever meet anybody and know
in a heartbeat you'd do whatever they say?

591
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,936
-You dated?
-We courted.

592
00:39:55,978 --> 00:39:57,813
-Meaning?
-We had sex three times.

593
00:39:57,855 --> 00:39:59,815
He told me I had a perfect body!

594
00:39:59,857 --> 00:40:02,401
I was so inexperienced,
I had no idea he was right!

595
00:40:02,443 --> 00:40:05,613
I still have a fine body but of course
it's never the same after childbirth.

596
00:40:05,654 --> 00:40:08,657
-Would you please?
-My girlfriend's parents were out of town.

597
00:40:08,699 --> 00:40:10,868
He and I were in a sleeping bag
in their backyard.

598
00:40:10,910 --> 00:40:12,870
We made love.

599
00:40:12,912 --> 00:40:16,999
It was so cold outside the sleeping bag,
and so warm in it,

600
00:40:17,041 --> 00:40:21,962
and afterwards, I cried and cried and cried,
and he pretended to understand why.

601
00:40:22,004 --> 00:40:24,006
So that's where I was conceived?

602
00:40:24,048 --> 00:40:27,676
No, you were conceived a week later,
according to a great American tradition.

603
00:40:27,718 --> 00:40:29,720
-Speak English.
-I fucked him at a drive-in.

604
00:40:29,762 --> 00:40:31,514
-What movie?
-Bullitt.

605
00:40:33,265 --> 00:40:36,102
-Why did you lie?
-I don't know why.

606
00:40:36,102 --> 00:40:39,188
I thought it was ugly and ordinary,
and I wanted to make it beautiful.

607
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:41,482
If I made him famous and dead,
he'd be famously dead,

608
00:40:41,524 --> 00:40:43,567
and you wouldn't waste time
trying to find him.

609
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:46,946
-I tried for years. He's unfindable.
-How convenient.

610
00:40:46,987 --> 00:40:50,408
Look, don't you think that if I could
offer your father up to you, I'd do it,

611
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:53,077
-whatever shape he was in?
-How should I know what you'd do?

612
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:55,413
-Because I'm telling you!
-What is that worth?

613
00:40:55,454 --> 00:40:58,833
-I'm giving you my word!
-Bernice, look at me.

614
00:40:58,874 --> 00:41:00,626
I will know if you're lying.

615
00:41:01,961 --> 00:41:06,340
Memorise this moment.
I know what I did to you.

616
00:41:06,382 --> 00:41:09,510
I lied in the scariest way imaginable,

617
00:41:09,552 --> 00:41:12,930
and now, at the worst of all possible
times, when your husband just left you...

618
00:41:12,972 --> 00:41:17,059
Or did you leave him?
I get the sense that he left you.

619
00:41:17,101 --> 00:41:18,727
OK, it's none of my business.

620
00:41:20,646 --> 00:41:22,064
It will not happen again.

621
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:35,703
I knew it. I knew it.
That's why I said Steve McQueen.

622
00:41:35,745 --> 00:41:37,913
-What?
-I knew you'd be ashamed.

623
00:41:37,955 --> 00:41:42,835
It's not that. Please understand,
it's not you as much as me.

624
00:41:42,835 --> 00:41:44,336
I'm glad to have met you,

625
00:41:44,336 --> 00:41:48,174
but I'm going through some things,
and now is not a good time.

626
00:41:49,175 --> 00:41:54,638
Thank you for understanding, and I really
do hope that our paths will cross again.

627
00:41:55,973 --> 00:42:00,853
I'm gonna walk home now,
so... goodbye.

628
00:42:23,209 --> 00:42:25,336
-You're absurd!
-Give me 72 hours.

629
00:42:26,337 --> 00:42:30,132
Three lousy days. I want to know you.
I want to meet your brother.

630
00:42:31,092 --> 00:42:32,676
I'm begging you.

631
00:42:32,718 --> 00:42:34,303
I'm on my knees.

632
00:42:36,305 --> 00:42:39,266
Metaphorically speaking,
I'm on my knees.

633
00:42:41,435 --> 00:42:43,187
Oh, for God's sake!

634
00:42:53,406 --> 00:42:55,533
<i>It's Freddy. Leave me a message.</i>

635
00:42:56,367 --> 00:42:59,870
I'm begging you. Come with me.
I'm going to this event with her.

636
00:42:59,912 --> 00:43:02,706
She wants to meet you.
Or at least call me back.

637
00:43:02,748 --> 00:43:04,625
I know you're working hard, but I worry.

638
00:43:09,255 --> 00:43:11,465
"I was," mumbled Gun Smith.

639
00:43:11,507 --> 00:43:16,554
"No one had ever tangled with those two
varmints and lived to tell the tale. "

640
00:43:16,595 --> 00:43:18,597
"So one day, a drifter... "

641
00:43:21,475 --> 00:43:23,227
Hello?

642
00:43:25,563 --> 00:43:27,648
<i>-Never mind.
-What?</i>

643
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:31,026
I have the wrong number.

644
00:43:31,068 --> 00:43:33,446
-Miss Epner?
-Hello.

645
00:43:34,447 --> 00:43:36,741
-Hi, it's Jimmy Ray.
-Of course it is.

646
00:43:36,782 --> 00:43:39,118
Hello, Jimmy Ray,
is your father there?

647
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,036
Dad, it's Miss Epner.

648
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:46,751
-Hello.
-God! Hello. It's me, it's Miss Epner.

649
00:43:46,792 --> 00:43:48,127
<i>Hello, Miss Epner.</i>

650
00:43:48,169 --> 00:43:50,045
-It's April.
-Hi.

651
00:43:51,046 --> 00:43:52,840
-Is Jimmy Ray right there?
-Yes.

652
00:43:52,882 --> 00:43:56,802
Oh, God! Just please, just say

653
00:43:56,844 --> 00:43:59,180
"OK, Miss Epner",
and I'll call you another time.

654
00:43:59,221 --> 00:44:00,556
OK, Miss Epner.

655
00:44:00,598 --> 00:44:05,102
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have called you
during the day. It was a really bad mistake.

656
00:44:05,144 --> 00:44:06,854
<i>OK, Miss Epner.</i>

657
00:44:10,024 --> 00:44:11,358
Are you there?

658
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,986
Would you like to go out with me
tomorrow night?

659
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:16,113
More than I can say.

660
00:44:17,114 --> 00:44:21,577
-Everybody say, "Send us money!"
-Send us money!

661
00:44:30,377 --> 00:44:33,631
-Oh, you look lovely.
-Thank you. So do you.

662
00:44:33,672 --> 00:44:35,049
Thank you.

663
00:44:39,804 --> 00:44:42,640
I'm glad you didn't bring a date.
It'll be more fun this way.

664
00:44:42,681 --> 00:44:45,309
-I did bring a date.
-Oh, good, I'm so glad!

665
00:44:45,351 --> 00:44:46,977
-Where is he?
-He's meeting me here.

666
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:49,855
-Oh. Is this your first date?
-With him or since my husband?

667
00:44:49,897 --> 00:44:51,232
-Either.
-Both.

668
00:44:51,273 --> 00:44:52,900
-Jesus Christ! You want a drink?

669
00:44:52,942 --> 00:44:54,819
-Yes, please.
-OK.

670
00:44:54,860 --> 00:44:56,529
April.

671
00:45:03,536 --> 00:45:05,704
-Hi.
-Hello. You look beautiful.

672
00:45:05,746 --> 00:45:08,374
-Doesn't she?
-Uh, Frank, this is Bernice.

673
00:45:08,416 --> 00:45:09,875
I'm so glad to get to meet you.

674
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:12,420
-Thank you.
-I've enjoyed your show.

675
00:45:12,461 --> 00:45:15,423
Oh, you're lying.
You've never seen my show.

676
00:45:15,464 --> 00:45:17,133
I don't do a lot of lying.

677
00:45:17,174 --> 00:45:18,884
Well, that makes one of us.

678
00:45:19,844 --> 00:45:21,178
Hey, beautiful!

679
00:45:22,471 --> 00:45:23,848
His name is Ted.

680
00:45:23,889 --> 00:45:26,976
I think he has the best ass
I've ever seen on a 50-year-old man.

681
00:45:27,017 --> 00:45:28,394
-Hey.
-Hey.

682
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:35,025
-Oh, you must be April.
-Yes. It's nice to meet you. This is Frank.

683
00:45:35,067 --> 00:45:36,819
-Hello.
-A pleasure.

684
00:45:36,861 --> 00:45:38,738
-Shall we get some drinks?
-Absolutely.

685
00:45:38,779 --> 00:45:41,991
-After you.
-No, please, after you.

686
00:45:50,374 --> 00:45:55,588
OK.
Everybody say, "Sake bomb!"

687
00:45:55,629 --> 00:45:57,089
Sake bomb!

688
00:45:57,882 --> 00:46:00,009
-Oh, my gosh!
-You're telling me!

689
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,844
-I love these.
-I knew I liked you.

690
00:46:01,886 --> 00:46:03,596
I don't drink like this.

691
00:46:03,637 --> 00:46:05,139
Well, tonight you do.

692
00:46:05,181 --> 00:46:07,892
-Am I being too nice to her?
-No!

693
00:46:07,933 --> 00:46:10,060
-Not nice enough?
-What do you mean?

694
00:46:10,102 --> 00:46:13,439
This is your mother. Are you getting
what you want from me as your date?

695
00:46:13,481 --> 00:46:16,984
Oh, God, just that you asked.
You're perfect.

696
00:46:17,026 --> 00:46:18,444
Thank God you're here!

697
00:46:20,071 --> 00:46:23,032
I am perfect, by the way.
I'm glad you noticed.

698
00:46:24,533 --> 00:46:27,453
Just to get this in...
before we're hopelessly drunk.

699
00:46:28,496 --> 00:46:30,122
I'm so glad you called.

700
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:35,127
I know we're not ready,
but I love talking to you.

701
00:46:35,169 --> 00:46:37,254
You move me.

702
00:46:37,296 --> 00:46:40,257
This moves me,
that you're trying this with her.

703
00:46:41,342 --> 00:46:42,718
I'm so glad I'm here.

704
00:46:42,760 --> 00:46:45,513
Oh!

705
00:46:45,554 --> 00:46:46,972
God, I'm sorry!

706
00:46:46,972 --> 00:46:50,267
After he said something like that?
They should make those things illegal.

707
00:46:50,309 --> 00:46:55,815
I'm sure it's my brother. I'm sure.
I'm sorry. I just worry. Sorry.

708
00:46:55,856 --> 00:46:58,275
-Is it you?
-It's me.

709
00:46:59,777 --> 00:47:01,112
Oh.

710
00:47:01,612 --> 00:47:02,947
Hello.

711
00:47:04,281 --> 00:47:06,951
<i>-Hi.
-Hi.</i>

712
00:47:06,992 --> 00:47:08,411
<i>Sorry, hi.</i>

713
00:47:08,452 --> 00:47:10,121
-Everything all right?
-Yes.

714
00:47:10,162 --> 00:47:13,833
<i>-Who's that?
-No one. I'm sorry, I'll be right back.</i>

715
00:47:16,877 --> 00:47:19,338
<i>-Hello?
-Yeah, I'm here.</i>

716
00:47:20,673 --> 00:47:22,842
<i>-Hi.
-Hi.</i>

717
00:47:22,883 --> 00:47:24,677
Hi.

718
00:47:25,719 --> 00:47:28,973
So, how are you? Where are you?

719
00:47:30,182 --> 00:47:34,520
Nowhere special. Decided to drift around
for a while, you know -get lost.

720
00:47:34,562 --> 00:47:37,690
Let the road take me
where it wants me to go.

721
00:47:37,732 --> 00:47:40,401
-Just tell me.
-I'm at my mom's.

722
00:47:40,443 --> 00:47:42,903
-That's perfect!
-Don't do that.

723
00:47:42,945 --> 00:47:44,447
-What?
-Humiliate me.

724
00:47:44,530 --> 00:47:47,950
-Do you know the actual, physical pain...
-Why are you calling me?

725
00:47:48,033 --> 00:47:50,828
Because I miss you, and I thought now
that some time has passed...

726
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:54,707
It's been 23 days, you idiot!
You're ready to be my friend?

727
00:47:54,749 --> 00:47:58,335
Well... OK, I'm glad I called.

728
00:48:00,296 --> 00:48:02,047
<i>-Well, take care...
-My mom died.</i>

729
00:48:02,089 --> 00:48:03,758
-Did you say...
-Talk to you later.

730
00:48:03,799 --> 00:48:06,594
-Wait, when?
-22 days ago.

731
00:48:06,635 --> 00:48:07,928
Why didn't you call me?

732
00:48:07,970 --> 00:48:10,848
Oh, I don't know,
I guess I just didn't feel that close to you.

733
00:48:10,890 --> 00:48:12,850
I have to, I have to see you.

734
00:48:12,892 --> 00:48:15,895
<i>-Oh, no. I'll end up in bed with you and...
-I want to be there.</i>

735
00:48:15,936 --> 00:48:21,067
Really? Do you promise to be there for
better or worse, for richer and poorer,

736
00:48:21,108 --> 00:48:24,153
<i>-in sickness...
-I miss you.</i>

737
00:48:24,195 --> 00:48:26,197
How much?

738
00:48:26,238 --> 00:48:27,990
<i>A lot.</i>

739
00:48:28,032 --> 00:48:29,408
Enough?

740
00:48:38,375 --> 00:48:41,962
That's what I thought.
Be a man and leave me alone!

741
00:48:45,424 --> 00:48:46,926
"For better or worse. "

742
00:48:47,968 --> 00:48:49,887
I'm gonna guess not your brother, right?

743
00:48:51,931 --> 00:48:53,265
No.

744
00:49:02,566 --> 00:49:04,276
Oh, where are you going?

745
00:49:04,318 --> 00:49:06,404
-I think I'm leaving.
-Please don't leave!

746
00:49:12,576 --> 00:49:14,412
-Now where you going?
-I'm not leaving.

747
00:49:14,453 --> 00:49:17,331
-You just said you were leaving.
-I was then, now I'm not.

748
00:49:17,373 --> 00:49:18,833
But you're walking away.

749
00:49:18,874 --> 00:49:20,251
I have to do something.

750
00:49:20,292 --> 00:49:23,254
OK. Are we doing it yet?

751
00:49:24,046 --> 00:49:28,050
All right, look,
you were just talking to your husband

752
00:49:28,092 --> 00:49:30,469
about for better or worse
and god knows what else,

753
00:49:30,511 --> 00:49:32,012
and I just, I feel...

754
00:49:34,765 --> 00:49:36,100
Aargh!

755
00:49:37,184 --> 00:49:38,519
Fuck!

756
00:49:38,561 --> 00:49:43,399
When I feel this way, I find it helps
to take my "Aargh fuck" out for a walk,

757
00:49:43,441 --> 00:49:46,402
so that's what I'm doing,
and you're not invited.

758
00:49:48,279 --> 00:49:50,114
But I will say this, this is a first date,

759
00:49:50,156 --> 00:49:52,742
and if you're not done with him
who you're married to,

760
00:49:52,783 --> 00:49:55,453
if you two aren't done, it's fine.

761
00:49:55,494 --> 00:49:58,122
It's more than fine.
Just tell me. I'm not ready, anyway.

762
00:49:58,164 --> 00:50:00,666
-Frank, I'm done with him.
-It's OK if you're not.

763
00:50:00,708 --> 00:50:03,627
-But I am.
-How do I know?

764
00:50:03,669 --> 00:50:06,380
You're gonna have to... trust me.

765
00:50:08,382 --> 00:50:09,884
You kidding me?

766
00:50:11,343 --> 00:50:14,138
And it doesn't feel like a first date,
not to me.

767
00:50:15,431 --> 00:50:18,142
You wait until we try to say good night.

768
00:50:20,269 --> 00:50:24,106
I'm sorry again,
and I had a wonderful time with you.

769
00:50:24,148 --> 00:50:26,108
I did, too.

770
00:50:29,278 --> 00:50:31,155
See?

771
00:51:01,602 --> 00:51:03,687
I haven't done this for a long, long time,

772
00:51:03,729 --> 00:51:07,525
so, forgive me for not finding
a sexier way to put this,

773
00:51:07,566 --> 00:51:09,819
-but would you like to come in?
-I can't.

774
00:51:10,820 --> 00:51:12,154
You can't?

775
00:51:12,196 --> 00:51:15,866
As if having a jealous girlie fit on our first
date wasn't emasculating enough,

776
00:51:15,908 --> 00:51:18,077
I have to get home to my kids.

777
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:20,413
They need their mum, and I'm it.

778
00:51:22,164 --> 00:51:24,667
That's not emasculating.
It's very sexy.

779
00:51:28,462 --> 00:51:29,964
How sexy?

780
00:51:44,687 --> 00:51:46,689
You have a very nice house.

781
00:51:53,028 --> 00:51:55,740
# She says wake up

782
00:51:55,781 --> 00:51:58,492
# It's no use breaking down

783
00:51:58,534 --> 00:52:03,038
# I'll keep stealing, breathing her

784
00:52:04,165 --> 00:52:08,377
# Birds are leaving over autumn's ending...

785
00:52:09,920 --> 00:52:12,173
# One of us will...

786
00:52:12,214 --> 00:52:13,549
What?

787
00:52:15,092 --> 00:52:16,927
You're looking at me.

788
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:20,431
# Eyes wide open...

789
00:52:20,473 --> 00:52:21,932
Of course I am.

790
00:52:21,974 --> 00:52:25,060
# Naked as we came...

791
00:52:25,102 --> 00:52:26,437
Of course you are.

792
00:52:29,065 --> 00:52:35,279
# One will spread our...

793
00:52:35,321 --> 00:52:37,990
#Ashes round the yard...

794
00:52:39,658 --> 00:52:40,993
Mm!

795
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:52,088
<i>-Hello?
-Do you think I should sleep with him?</i>

796
00:52:52,171 --> 00:52:53,464
<i>Who is this?</i>

797
00:52:53,506 --> 00:52:55,591
<i>Why aren't you answering
your regular phone?</i>

798
00:52:55,633 --> 00:52:58,094
I called your regular phone.

799
00:52:58,177 --> 00:52:59,512
Because I'm not.

800
00:52:59,553 --> 00:53:01,680
Are you at his house?

801
00:53:01,722 --> 00:53:04,600
-Um...
-Oh, that's fantastic!

802
00:53:04,642 --> 00:53:07,186
That's just what you need,
a great rebound affair.

803
00:53:07,228 --> 00:53:09,271
I think it might be more...

804
00:53:09,355 --> 00:53:11,565
<i>-God, I've gotta get outta here!
-I'm all for it/</i>

805
00:53:11,607 --> 00:53:12,775
Talk to you later.

806
00:53:33,129 --> 00:53:34,588
-Are you sl...?
-What happened?

807
00:53:34,630 --> 00:53:36,132
Shh!

808
00:53:37,133 --> 00:53:39,009
Why are you in here?

809
00:53:39,009 --> 00:53:41,429
I sleep in here when I can't sleep.

810
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:43,722
Oh. I'm gonna go.

811
00:53:43,764 --> 00:53:46,767
-Just lie down here with me.
-No, no, no! I'm your son's teacher.

812
00:53:46,809 --> 00:53:49,687
Fifteen minutes, please,
then you can go.

813
00:53:51,522 --> 00:53:52,857
Mm!

814
00:54:00,614 --> 00:54:03,451
-I don't suppose we could...
-I'm going right now!

815
00:54:03,492 --> 00:54:06,120
I'm kidding!
I wouldn't, even if you begged me.

816
00:54:25,848 --> 00:54:27,892
It's possible I'm falling in love with you.

817
00:54:35,858 --> 00:54:38,319
So much for sleeping.

818
00:54:40,863 --> 00:54:42,490
-Too much?
-No.

819
00:54:45,493 --> 00:54:46,827
Maybe.

820
00:54:48,579 --> 00:54:50,164
I don't know.

821
00:54:56,087 --> 00:54:57,421
No.

822
00:55:00,341 --> 00:55:01,675
Good.

823
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:05,596
Cos it scared the shit out of me.

824
00:55:23,697 --> 00:55:25,199
Oh, God!

825
00:55:27,118 --> 00:55:29,412
All right, sweetie.
All right. It's your ear.

826
00:55:29,453 --> 00:55:32,998
Come on, sweetheart,
I'm right here, I'm right here.

827
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:34,375
It's your ear acting up again.

828
00:55:34,417 --> 00:55:38,212
Jimmy Ray!
Jimmy Ray, I need you to wake up.

829
00:55:38,254 --> 00:55:40,506
Jimmy Ray, Ruby's having her ear thing.

830
00:55:40,548 --> 00:55:44,301
I need you to go to my room and get the
flashlight by my bed. Can you do that?

831
00:55:44,301 --> 00:55:46,887
All right, Daddy's here.
Let's just have a look.

832
00:55:46,929 --> 00:55:48,681
Go on, quick as you can.

833
00:55:48,722 --> 00:55:51,725
Let's have a look. I'm not gonna touch.
I'm just gonna have a look.

834
00:55:51,767 --> 00:55:53,477
Miss Epner's here.

835
00:55:53,519 --> 00:55:55,813
Hi, how are you?

836
00:55:55,813 --> 00:55:57,440
Ow!

837
00:55:57,481 --> 00:56:01,777
Miss Epner and I had a sleepover.
And now we're all gonna go to the hospital,

838
00:56:01,819 --> 00:56:05,281
so we can get something
to make Ruby's ear feel better.

839
00:56:05,322 --> 00:56:07,616
Get your socks, buddy.

840
00:56:08,659 --> 00:56:11,454
Is there anything I can do?
Do you want me to lock up after you go?

841
00:56:12,496 --> 00:56:14,331
You're not coming?

842
00:56:16,959 --> 00:56:18,502
Yes, I'm coming.

843
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:26,343
# She says if I leave before you, darlin'

844
00:56:26,385 --> 00:56:31,307
# Don't you waste me, in the ground

845
00:56:32,183 --> 00:56:37,521
# I lay smiling like our sleeping children

846
00:56:37,563 --> 00:56:44,570
# One of us will die inside these arms

847
00:56:45,613 --> 00:56:50,201
# Eyes wide open...

848
00:56:50,242 --> 00:56:52,536
-How are you?
-Better.

849
00:56:52,578 --> 00:56:55,706
# Naked as we came...

850
00:56:55,748 --> 00:56:57,083
That's a nice frog.

851
00:56:57,124 --> 00:56:59,335
You could have it.

852
00:56:59,376 --> 00:57:02,713
-Seriously?
-I have another.

853
00:57:02,755 --> 00:57:04,715
# Ashes round the... #

854
00:57:04,757 --> 00:57:06,217
Thank you.

855
00:57:06,258 --> 00:57:08,302
You wanna give me something?

856
00:57:10,221 --> 00:57:11,889
I have a mint.

857
00:57:28,406 --> 00:57:30,950
Can you excuse me just a second?

858
00:57:58,269 --> 00:58:00,604
-Hello there.
-Hello.

859
00:58:00,771 --> 00:58:02,273
<i>-Hello, beautiful.
-Hello.</i>

860
00:58:02,314 --> 00:58:04,400
-Champagne?
-I'll say.

861
00:58:04,442 --> 00:58:07,737
I'll have a ginger ale, please,
and some crackers, if you have any.

862
00:58:07,778 --> 00:58:09,113
<i>Right away.</i>

863
00:58:09,113 --> 00:58:10,865
Ginger ale and crackers?

864
00:58:10,906 --> 00:58:13,784
<i>Blessed are You our God,
King of the Universe,</i>

865
00:58:13,826 --> 00:58:16,454
<i>One Who brings
out bread from the earth</i>

866
00:58:20,833 --> 00:58:23,002
-What?
-Are you pregnant?

867
00:58:24,211 --> 00:58:25,546
What?

868
00:58:25,588 --> 00:58:26,922
No.

869
00:58:26,964 --> 00:58:30,509
If I am, it would be a world's record.
I only slept with him last night.

870
00:58:32,970 --> 00:58:35,431
Trust me, I am not pregnant.

871
00:58:41,312 --> 00:58:42,938
I'm too old not to have a baby.

872
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:44,815
Obviously you're not too old
to have a baby.

873
00:58:44,815 --> 00:58:47,151
No, I'm too old not to have a baby,

874
00:58:47,193 --> 00:58:50,237
and this baby connects me forever
to a man,

875
00:58:50,279 --> 00:58:52,948
-who is that man you were talking about.
-What man?

876
00:58:52,990 --> 00:58:58,454
Who you know you'll do whatever they say.
Only he's not a man, he's a child really.

877
00:58:58,496 --> 00:59:00,247
A baby. Oh, Jesus!

878
00:59:02,833 --> 00:59:05,795
-What are you doing?
-This helps me.

879
00:59:05,836 --> 00:59:07,213
Is it helping?

880
00:59:07,254 --> 00:59:08,631
Not really.

881
00:59:08,672 --> 00:59:10,966
April... Allow me.

882
00:59:57,721 --> 00:59:59,223
Mm.

883
01:00:00,349 --> 01:00:02,685
-Have a sip.
-I'm pregnant!

884
01:00:02,727 --> 01:00:06,480
It's OK to have a sip of red wine.
Some doctors say it's good.

885
01:00:12,820 --> 01:00:14,155
Mm!

886
01:00:15,239 --> 01:00:17,992
What, are you nuts?
You're pregnant! Give me that.

887
01:00:21,328 --> 01:00:22,747
Come here.

888
01:00:22,747 --> 01:00:26,834
-That's OK, you don't have to do that.
-I'm just sitting here.

889
01:01:07,792 --> 01:01:10,795
-He lives with his mother?
-Don't get me started.

890
01:01:10,795 --> 01:01:12,213
Now, remember.

891
01:01:13,172 --> 01:01:14,423
What?

892
01:01:15,508 --> 01:01:16,842
I don't know.

893
01:01:16,884 --> 01:01:20,387
Would your other mother
have said something helpful right now?

894
01:01:21,472 --> 01:01:23,015
You're doing really well.

895
01:01:31,982 --> 01:01:35,152
-Hi, Alice.
-Oh, hello, dear.

896
01:01:35,194 --> 01:01:36,946
Hello.

897
01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:41,367
Uh, so, how are you?

898
01:01:41,409 --> 01:01:43,744
Well, you know, my back hurts.

899
01:01:43,786 --> 01:01:45,413
That's too bad.

900
01:01:48,666 --> 01:01:50,709
So, Alice,
can Benjamin come out and play?

901
01:01:50,751 --> 01:01:52,545
Mom, let her in!

902
01:01:52,586 --> 01:01:56,173
Well, I don't know
what you two are up to.

903
01:01:56,215 --> 01:01:59,093
-Hi. Sorry.
-Could you come out here?

904
01:01:59,135 --> 01:02:01,303
Yeah.

905
01:02:08,811 --> 01:02:10,938
-Who's that?
-A friend.

906
01:02:14,191 --> 01:02:15,693
I'm pregnant.

907
01:02:15,735 --> 01:02:17,778
Oh.

908
01:02:18,821 --> 01:02:21,157
-Oh, my God!
-Mm.

909
01:02:21,198 --> 01:02:22,742
Oh, my God! Is it?

910
01:02:26,036 --> 01:02:27,371
Wow!

911
01:02:29,749 --> 01:02:31,500
Sweetie, wow!

912
01:02:35,588 --> 01:02:36,964
Wow.

913
01:02:41,469 --> 01:02:43,179
Are you kidding me?

914
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:45,014
What'd I do?

915
01:02:45,055 --> 01:02:46,474
Say something.

916
01:02:46,515 --> 01:02:47,892
What do you want me to say?

917
01:02:48,893 --> 01:02:52,897
I don't know. What does it mean to you?
How do you want to handle it?

918
01:02:52,938 --> 01:02:54,690
What do we do now?

919
01:02:54,732 --> 01:02:56,484
-Well, I...
-That sort of thing!

920
01:02:56,525 --> 01:02:59,320
I wanna try to be with you, I guess.

921
01:03:01,072 --> 01:03:04,867
I'm sorry if I didn't instantly
come up with a perfect solution

922
01:03:04,909 --> 01:03:06,786
to this very complicated situation!

923
01:03:06,827 --> 01:03:09,538
It's not complicated!
I'm having this baby.

924
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:13,626
You may participate in the raising
of this baby. I can't make you do it,

925
01:03:13,667 --> 01:03:15,753
but I would hope
that you would wanna be there

926
01:03:15,795 --> 01:03:19,090
for the growing up
of this person who carries your DNA!

927
01:03:19,131 --> 01:03:22,927
The first doctor's appointment is
in two weeks. I'll see you there, or I won't.

928
01:03:29,642 --> 01:03:31,102
I'm so sorry.

929
01:03:31,102 --> 01:03:33,354
I've never met anyone like you, ever.

930
01:03:33,396 --> 01:03:35,898
I've never been so much myself
with anyone.

931
01:03:35,940 --> 01:03:39,068
Even these few times we've spent together
have felt like...

932
01:03:39,110 --> 01:03:41,237
What?

933
01:03:41,278 --> 01:03:44,990
Family. I'm sorry, but it has.

934
01:03:46,325 --> 01:03:48,577
And I know it's fast,
but I can only tell you how I feel,

935
01:03:48,619 --> 01:03:52,081
and how I feel
is that I wanna be near you all the time.

936
01:03:52,123 --> 01:03:55,000
But I have some big decisions to make
about how my life's gonna work,

937
01:03:55,042 --> 01:03:57,420
-and if you'll have me, so do you.
-Why you talking fast?

938
01:03:57,461 --> 01:03:58,921
Jimmy Ray shouldn't know I'm here.

939
01:03:58,963 --> 01:04:00,256
If we're gonna be family,

940
01:04:00,297 --> 01:04:03,300
he should know he didn't dream you up
half-naked in his house.

941
01:04:03,342 --> 01:04:04,927
And besides, he knows you're here.

942
01:04:04,969 --> 01:04:07,805
No, I was very careful to wait
till he was a safe distance away.

943
01:04:07,847 --> 01:04:09,849
Hi, Miss Epner.

944
01:04:09,890 --> 01:04:11,267
Hi, Jimmy Ray.

945
01:04:13,060 --> 01:04:15,187
D'you wanna be with him -
the better or worse guy?

946
01:04:15,229 --> 01:04:17,440
Is that someone you wanna be with?

947
01:04:17,481 --> 01:04:19,108
-No, it's not.
-But if it is...

948
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:23,112
But it's not.
Truthfully? I wanna be with you.

949
01:04:24,488 --> 01:04:28,784
But being with me
is gonna mean being with this.

950
01:04:31,537 --> 01:04:33,164
How pregnant are you?

951
01:04:33,205 --> 01:04:35,791
-They said six weeks.
-Six weeks?

952
01:04:35,833 --> 01:04:38,794
That's what they said, six weeks today.

953
01:04:38,836 --> 01:04:40,921
We met six weeks ago today, actually.

954
01:04:40,963 --> 01:04:43,799
-Mm.
-Which was the day he left.

955
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:49,388
You made love on the day we met?

956
01:04:51,849 --> 01:04:54,435
Ah... Yeah.

957
01:04:57,396 --> 01:04:58,898
Sorry.

958
01:04:59,940 --> 01:05:01,817
What happened?

959
01:05:01,859 --> 01:05:03,944
Um, I've gotta take a walk.

960
01:05:03,986 --> 01:05:06,030
-Really?
-Yes, really.

961
01:05:06,072 --> 01:05:09,742
I'm on the brink of asking you
to be with me -really, really be with me.

962
01:05:09,784 --> 01:05:13,954
You, who have some other guy's...
your husband's baby in your stomach,

963
01:05:13,996 --> 01:05:15,372
your very beautiful stomach.

964
01:05:17,166 --> 01:05:18,501
I've gotta take a walk.

965
01:05:18,542 --> 01:05:21,045
-What about your kids?
-What about them?

966
01:05:21,045 --> 01:05:23,297
-Who's gonna watch them?
-You are.

967
01:05:32,056 --> 01:05:34,350
The walk didn't work.
Your mother's here.

968
01:05:34,392 --> 01:05:37,103
No, she's not.
I told her to wait in the car.

969
01:05:41,232 --> 01:05:42,942
I'm just here if either of you need me.

970
01:05:45,903 --> 01:05:47,947
I can't stand the thought of it.

971
01:05:47,988 --> 01:05:49,740
Of me sleeping with my husband?

972
01:05:49,782 --> 01:05:52,243
You slept with your wife,
at least twice, you know.

973
01:05:52,243 --> 01:05:55,663
It's not like the most appetising thing
I've ever imagined.

974
01:05:55,704 --> 01:05:57,498
No, of course it's not.

975
01:06:00,251 --> 01:06:01,544
Hey.

976
01:06:02,169 --> 01:06:03,504
You're pregnant.

977
01:06:05,089 --> 01:06:06,507
Yes, I am.

978
01:06:08,175 --> 01:06:09,552
Way to go.

979
01:06:13,597 --> 01:06:15,099
So now what?

980
01:06:15,141 --> 01:06:18,644
Both of them, or neither of them,
will show up at the doctor's office.

981
01:06:18,686 --> 01:06:20,604
All I know is, I'll be there.

982
01:06:32,908 --> 01:06:35,244
You don't know how to work a blender!

983
01:06:35,286 --> 01:06:37,079
Take your hat off.

984
01:06:37,121 --> 01:06:38,914
Jeez!

985
01:06:38,956 --> 01:06:40,332
Hello.

986
01:06:40,374 --> 01:06:41,709
-Hello.
-Hello.

987
01:06:41,751 --> 01:06:43,210
-How are you?
-Hi.

988
01:06:43,252 --> 01:06:44,837
-Hi.
-Hello.

989
01:06:44,879 --> 01:06:46,797
Hm. Um...

990
01:06:47,798 --> 01:06:49,133
Sorry.

991
01:06:49,175 --> 01:06:51,927
So... Anyone else coming?

992
01:06:51,969 --> 01:06:54,764
-No. This is it.
-No, this is it.

993
01:06:54,805 --> 01:06:57,183
Uh, could you lower this, please?

994
01:07:36,347 --> 01:07:37,765
Oh, my God.

995
01:07:37,807 --> 01:07:41,060
This looks really good.
I've seen a couple of these.

996
01:07:41,102 --> 01:07:44,563
-Where did she go?
-She'll be back.

997
01:07:55,408 --> 01:07:56,951
Look at that.

998
01:07:58,244 --> 01:08:00,329
Oh, my God.

999
01:08:00,371 --> 01:08:02,415
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

1000
01:08:04,500 --> 01:08:06,377
-So, what exactly is...
-Sorry.

1001
01:08:06,419 --> 01:08:08,504
-No, go ahead.
-No, no, go ahead.

1002
01:08:08,546 --> 01:08:11,424
He, or she just looks great.

1003
01:08:18,389 --> 01:08:21,517
Can I have a look at that
before I have to run?

1004
01:08:24,979 --> 01:08:26,313
She's beautiful.

1005
01:08:26,355 --> 01:08:28,357
We made a baby.

1006
01:08:50,463 --> 01:08:53,090
-You look pretty.
-It's the hormones.

1007
01:08:53,132 --> 01:08:54,467
Whatever.

1008
01:09:41,972 --> 01:09:43,391
Oh!

1009
01:09:43,432 --> 01:09:44,767
Your back?

1010
01:09:44,809 --> 01:09:46,102
Yeah.

1011
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,694
Oh!

1012
01:10:01,784 --> 01:10:03,244
Ohh!

1013
01:10:05,162 --> 01:10:06,455
Oh.

1014
01:10:06,497 --> 01:10:07,581
Ah...

1015
01:10:07,623 --> 01:10:08,958
Oh.

1016
01:10:08,999 --> 01:10:10,626
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

1017
01:10:11,877 --> 01:10:13,212
Mm.

1018
01:10:13,712 --> 01:10:15,172
Um...

1019
01:10:21,011 --> 01:10:22,346
Um...

1020
01:10:38,487 --> 01:10:40,656
-Anything?
-What?

1021
01:10:42,491 --> 01:10:44,452
Do you have anything to say?

1022
01:10:44,493 --> 01:10:45,911
Don't.

1023
01:10:47,538 --> 01:10:49,165
I don't know what to say.

1024
01:10:51,459 --> 01:10:53,836
-Oh!
-See ya.

1025
01:11:12,188 --> 01:11:14,273
I thought we were having dinner
after the show.

1026
01:11:14,315 --> 01:11:15,816
I'm in trouble.

1027
01:11:15,858 --> 01:11:17,318
Come with me.

1028
01:11:18,402 --> 01:11:19,945
Phew!

1029
01:11:20,362 --> 01:11:22,823
-They're ready for you.
-We're gonna run late today.

1030
01:11:22,865 --> 01:11:24,450
-OK.
-I'm panicking.

1031
01:11:24,492 --> 01:11:27,995
-Tell me.
-I sort of... slept with my husband.

1032
01:11:28,037 --> 01:11:29,663
Well, almost.

1033
01:11:29,705 --> 01:11:31,373
Ohh!

1034
01:11:32,917 --> 01:11:34,794
Break-up sex, but it's kind of great, right?

1035
01:11:34,835 --> 01:11:36,796
Don't. Don't be glib about this.

1036
01:11:36,837 --> 01:11:40,508
I'm with a man who sees me,
really sees me,

1037
01:11:40,549 --> 01:11:44,386
and somehow still wants to be with me,
and I want him and I just blew it!

1038
01:11:46,555 --> 01:11:49,683
-Oh, God, it's him!
-I don't suppose you've cheated before.

1039
01:11:49,725 --> 01:11:52,019
-Mm-mm.
-Of course not.

1040
01:11:52,061 --> 01:11:54,730
With someone who's bad for me.
What am I gonna do?

1041
01:11:54,772 --> 01:11:57,858
Here's what we're going to do.
I'm going to go in and rehearse,

1042
01:11:57,900 --> 01:11:59,735
so everyone knows what they're doing,

1043
01:11:59,735 --> 01:12:03,906
and then I'm going to send everyone home,
and we're going to shoot the show tonight,

1044
01:12:03,906 --> 01:12:06,909
or in a couple of hours,
or maybe never. OK?

1045
01:12:06,951 --> 01:12:08,911
-Thank you.
-Mm. OK.

1046
01:12:10,246 --> 01:12:12,832
Edie, I have to tell you,
Sunday nights are about the...

1047
01:12:12,873 --> 01:12:17,128
A good question. Shall we make gay
marriage a priority during this election,

1048
01:12:17,169 --> 01:12:18,838
or should we just not take the bait?

1049
01:12:18,879 --> 01:12:22,758
If Pam dies, what happens
to our daughter? I have no rights.

1050
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:25,678
-Oh, thank you.
-It's very scary. Very scary.

1051
01:12:25,719 --> 01:12:28,889
At least I'm not one of those
insular gay men,

1052
01:12:28,931 --> 01:12:30,599
who throws himself into his work,

1053
01:12:30,641 --> 01:12:33,853
and devotes himself to people
who can never love him back romantically.

1054
01:12:35,271 --> 01:12:39,150
What we want to ask you is,
do you think it's right...

1055
01:12:39,191 --> 01:12:41,569
It's so hard for anyone to meet someone.

1056
01:12:44,488 --> 01:12:47,450
Have you ever seen the show
she did on you?

1057
01:12:47,450 --> 01:12:51,412
I can't be around people
who have adopted children.

1058
01:12:51,495 --> 01:12:53,581
Especially girls.

1059
01:12:53,622 --> 01:12:55,458
Have you ever tried to find her?

1060
01:12:55,458 --> 01:12:57,501
Endlessly.

1061
01:12:57,543 --> 01:13:01,464
On the Internet.
Um, I put ads in the paper.

1062
01:13:01,464 --> 01:13:05,551
Do you feel... haunted?

1063
01:13:05,593 --> 01:13:07,303
Yes.

1064
01:13:07,303 --> 01:13:10,056
Whenever there are kids around,

1065
01:13:10,097 --> 01:13:13,309
I'm always looking for her face.

1066
01:13:13,350 --> 01:13:16,228
In shopping malls, in the parks.

1067
01:13:16,270 --> 01:13:19,190
I have something I want to say.

1068
01:13:19,231 --> 01:13:20,858
I hadn't planned on doing this,

1069
01:13:20,900 --> 01:13:25,321
but hearing you speak,
it's just something I have to do.

1070
01:13:29,742 --> 01:13:33,287
I had a child that I gave up for adoption.

1071
01:13:34,288 --> 01:13:36,582
It was many, many years ago.
I was very young.

1072
01:13:36,624 --> 01:13:39,085
I tried, God knows,

1073
01:13:39,126 --> 01:13:42,046
but the year I spent with that child

1074
01:13:42,088 --> 01:13:44,632
was the scariest,
most darkly miserable time of my life.

1075
01:13:44,673 --> 01:13:47,384
One minute
you're cuddling in a sleeping bag

1076
01:13:47,426 --> 01:13:50,721
and the next minute,
you've ruined the rest of your life.

1077
01:13:50,763 --> 01:13:52,098
Can you rewind this?

1078
01:13:52,139 --> 01:13:54,266
-To the beginning?
-Um, no, just a little.

1079
01:13:57,061 --> 01:13:58,687
I tried, God knows,

1080
01:13:58,729 --> 01:14:01,899
but the year I spent with that child
was the scariest...

1081
01:14:01,941 --> 01:14:04,693
Go back again, just... five seconds.

1082
01:14:04,693 --> 01:14:06,320
Are you sure?

1083
01:14:06,362 --> 01:14:09,198
-Yeah, in fact, I don't...
-Could you go one sentence back?

1084
01:14:11,534 --> 01:14:13,494
...but the year I spent with that child

1085
01:14:13,536 --> 01:14:16,163
was the scariest,
most darkly miserable time of my life.

1086
01:14:16,205 --> 01:14:17,540
Finally, I said uncle.

1087
01:14:24,713 --> 01:14:26,590
Do you think you just hand it over?

1088
01:14:28,843 --> 01:14:30,428
You probably put it down somewhere,

1089
01:14:30,469 --> 01:14:33,764
and the next people come along
and pick it up?

1090
01:14:36,058 --> 01:14:37,601
Hey, can I find you some dry clothes?

1091
01:14:40,187 --> 01:14:42,189
You want me to get it?

1092
01:14:42,231 --> 01:14:43,983
It's me!

1093
01:14:44,775 --> 01:14:48,446
-Maybe you'll feel better if you talk to her.
-I can hear you in there.

1094
01:14:48,487 --> 01:14:49,905
Don't make me bang the door down.

1095
01:14:56,787 --> 01:14:59,498
-Hello.
-Hi. I've seen your picture.

1096
01:14:59,540 --> 01:15:01,083
She doesn't wanna see you right now.

1097
01:15:01,125 --> 01:15:02,418
Too bad, I'm her mother.

1098
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:05,004
Maybe another day would be better.

1099
01:15:07,923 --> 01:15:11,051
Unless you say no, I'll leave you alone
to have a private conversation.

1100
01:15:11,093 --> 01:15:15,056
-She's afraid to be left alone with me?
-I'm not afraid to be left alone.

1101
01:15:15,097 --> 01:15:17,391
I'll be on my beeper if you need me.

1102
01:15:21,771 --> 01:15:25,941
-Alan had no right...
-Are you capable of telling the truth?

1103
01:15:32,198 --> 01:15:33,824
I was fifteen years old.

1104
01:15:35,076 --> 01:15:39,038
That's a little bit older
than some of the kids in your school.

1105
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:42,583
Your father disappeared. My father
completely turned his back on me.

1106
01:15:42,625 --> 01:15:43,959
Was I breast feeding?

1107
01:15:47,338 --> 01:15:49,757
My mother said I'd ruined my life.

1108
01:15:49,799 --> 01:15:51,258
They threw me out!

1109
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:54,261
<i>I had a bag of clothes
and 48 dollars.</i>

1110
01:15:54,303 --> 01:15:58,140
<i>I didn't know if rent was $6 or $600!</i>

1111
01:15:58,140 --> 01:16:01,685
I didn't know how to open
a fucking can of soup!

1112
01:16:03,771 --> 01:16:05,231
You wouldn't stop crying.

1113
01:16:05,272 --> 01:16:06,941
I get it.

1114
01:16:06,982 --> 01:16:09,944
I watched the tape.
So did millions of others.

1115
01:16:09,985 --> 01:16:12,488
Well, not millions.
How many people watch your show?

1116
01:16:12,530 --> 01:16:16,075
Did you see on the tape
that I went to my father

1117
01:16:16,117 --> 01:16:18,369
with his grandchild in my belly,

1118
01:16:18,411 --> 01:16:21,747
and begged him for help,
and that he turned me away?

1119
01:16:21,789 --> 01:16:25,668
Did you see that I never forgave him,
that I didn't even go to his funeral?

1120
01:16:25,668 --> 01:16:28,587
You just saw the parts
that made me look bad.

1121
01:16:29,672 --> 01:16:31,507
I thought it was for the best!

1122
01:16:31,549 --> 01:16:35,886
Like an idiot, I thought it was for the best,
and then it was too late!

1123
01:16:35,928 --> 01:16:38,013
Too late?

1124
01:16:38,055 --> 01:16:40,891
Like if you had it to do over,
it would be different?

1125
01:16:41,934 --> 01:16:44,311
You'd sacrifice your fabulous life

1126
01:16:44,353 --> 01:16:50,317
to sit there with a cranky, moody kid
who got sick? A lot, by the way.

1127
01:16:50,359 --> 01:16:52,486
Sore throats, like on fire, ten a year!

1128
01:16:52,528 --> 01:16:56,282
You'd sit up till six in the morning,
rubbing her down with alcohol,

1129
01:16:56,323 --> 01:16:58,075
because her fever's around 106,

1130
01:16:58,117 --> 01:17:00,369
and that's about the time when
if you miss the signs,

1131
01:17:00,369 --> 01:17:03,539
you got a brain-damaged kid
for the rest of your life?

1132
01:17:03,581 --> 01:17:09,879
You'd get this girl grown up just to let
her know that you didn't love her enough?

1133
01:17:09,879 --> 01:17:11,672
Or the right way?

1134
01:17:12,757 --> 01:17:14,425
Your mother wasn't perfect.

1135
01:17:14,467 --> 01:17:16,177
She told me the truth.

1136
01:17:16,218 --> 01:17:18,429
She did her best.

1137
01:17:19,764 --> 01:17:21,348
She was there.

1138
01:17:28,105 --> 01:17:31,901
Just say you wanted a life
more than you wanted me.

1139
01:17:38,199 --> 01:17:41,368
I wanted a life...
more than I wanted you.

1140
01:17:51,420 --> 01:17:53,964
<i>-Hello?
-Hi, it's me.</i>

1141
01:17:54,006 --> 01:17:56,967
Listen,
that's never gonna happen again.

1142
01:17:57,009 --> 01:17:59,303
I really don't think it should.

1143
01:17:59,345 --> 01:18:03,099
-Good.
-I want to help with all this.

1144
01:18:03,099 --> 01:18:04,642
OK.

1145
01:18:06,185 --> 01:18:08,312
Any thoughts on how?

1146
01:18:08,354 --> 01:18:11,065
-Uh...
-Wait.

1147
01:18:12,149 --> 01:18:15,861
Can you say that again -
the part about wanting to help?

1148
01:18:15,903 --> 01:18:18,531
I really want to help with all of this.
I really, really do.

1149
01:18:19,573 --> 01:18:21,450
Thank you.

1150
01:18:21,492 --> 01:18:23,202
I want that, too.

1151
01:18:40,469 --> 01:18:42,096
-I've been scared to death.
-Sorry.

1152
01:18:42,138 --> 01:18:44,598
-I imagined you dead on the roadside.
-Sorry.

1153
01:18:44,640 --> 01:18:47,059
I imagined you dead
in the arms of a handsome stranger.

1154
01:18:47,101 --> 01:18:49,603
French guy, for some reason,
which was an even worse image.

1155
01:18:49,645 --> 01:18:51,981
-I mean...
-I said I'm sorry!

1156
01:18:56,235 --> 01:18:57,653
-What?
-What's going on?

1157
01:18:57,695 --> 01:18:59,613
-Nothing.
-Something happen?

1158
01:18:59,655 --> 01:19:01,490
-No.
-What are you not telling me?

1159
01:19:01,490 --> 01:19:03,659
What could I not be telling you?

1160
01:19:06,078 --> 01:19:10,791
Well, I don't know. Perhaps you don't love
me, you made a horrible mistake,

1161
01:19:10,833 --> 01:19:13,210
and you want to take the whole thing back.

1162
01:19:13,252 --> 01:19:17,089
I do love you.
I don't wanna take the whole thing back.

1163
01:19:21,469 --> 01:19:23,429
Listen, some...

1164
01:19:30,311 --> 01:19:31,979
I think he dropped something.

1165
01:19:40,196 --> 01:19:41,530
You're taking a walk?

1166
01:19:43,199 --> 01:19:45,034
-What about the kids?
-What do you care?

1167
01:19:45,076 --> 01:19:46,410
-I care.
-Clearly?

1168
01:19:46,452 --> 01:19:48,746
-I do.
-Go... home!

1169
01:19:49,872 --> 01:19:52,166
Not my home -yours!

1170
01:19:53,167 --> 01:19:54,502
Go!

1171
01:19:57,088 --> 01:19:59,799
-I don't have one without you.
-That's not my problem.

1172
01:20:00,841 --> 01:20:03,177
-What do you do on these walks?
-You don't want to know.

1173
01:20:03,219 --> 01:20:06,305
-Yes, I do.
-I say all the things I don't say to you.

1174
01:20:06,347 --> 01:20:08,432
-All the things I spare you from.
-Like what?

1175
01:20:08,474 --> 01:20:12,311
Like, go to hell!
Like, get your own children!

1176
01:20:12,353 --> 01:20:17,233
And like, what's the matter with you
that you don't have children anyway?

1177
01:20:17,233 --> 01:20:19,235
And like, what kind of mother
are you gonna be,

1178
01:20:19,276 --> 01:20:22,029
if you can walk out on your children
without a second thought?

1179
01:20:22,071 --> 01:20:23,948
-You know they're...
-What?

1180
01:20:23,989 --> 01:20:25,908
Not your children?

1181
01:20:26,909 --> 01:20:30,121
It's just possible some of this
is what you wanted to say to your wife.

1182
01:20:30,162 --> 01:20:31,872
Oh, really, you think so?

1183
01:20:36,585 --> 01:20:38,462
Do you understand
I can't even take a walk?

1184
01:20:38,504 --> 01:20:40,548
-It must be...
-Go to hell!

1185
01:20:40,589 --> 01:20:44,969
I don't have to be with you, I don't have
to care for you or this godforsaken baby!

1186
01:20:45,010 --> 01:20:47,430
-Don't say that!
-All I have to do,

1187
01:20:47,430 --> 01:20:51,267
is care for my children until
they're old enough to do it for themselves.

1188
01:20:51,267 --> 01:20:53,769
I don't even have to like it, or them.

1189
01:20:54,770 --> 01:20:56,731
Fuck them,

1190
01:20:56,772 --> 01:20:58,733
and fuck you!

1191
01:21:13,122 --> 01:21:16,167
-So, how long have you guys been dating?
-Oh, not long.

1192
01:21:16,208 --> 01:21:19,628
We had a date tonight and, uh,
she works right down the street,

1193
01:21:19,628 --> 01:21:21,422
so we decided to meet here.

1194
01:21:22,465 --> 01:21:23,799
Cool.

1195
01:21:30,056 --> 01:21:32,433
So, hello, hi, great to see you.

1196
01:21:32,475 --> 01:21:34,518
-Great to see you all.
-Good to see you.

1197
01:21:34,560 --> 01:21:36,103
-Uh, and you are?
-Freddy.

1198
01:21:36,145 --> 01:21:38,189
Freddy.
Well, great.

1199
01:21:38,230 --> 01:21:41,776
-Great.
-Oh, God, I'm her brother!

1200
01:21:43,319 --> 01:21:46,655
-Great. So... shall we?
-Yes.

1201
01:21:47,656 --> 01:21:49,784
-And you're at...
-Ten weeks?

1202
01:21:50,826 --> 01:21:52,161
Ten weeks.

1203
01:21:54,497 --> 01:21:56,832
Have you seen these before?
My brother's a doctor.

1204
01:21:56,874 --> 01:21:58,209
Yeah, I have.

1205
01:22:04,340 --> 01:22:06,342
Can you tell us what we're seeing?

1206
01:22:06,384 --> 01:22:08,135
Uh, just one moment, please.

1207
01:22:08,177 --> 01:22:10,513
Any chance we can hear
that squishing sound again?

1208
01:22:10,513 --> 01:22:12,139
That's the best thing I ever heard.

1209
01:22:20,773 --> 01:22:22,483
What's happening?

1210
01:22:26,529 --> 01:22:27,988
What's happening?

1211
01:22:32,952 --> 01:22:34,286
April...

1212
01:22:35,913 --> 01:22:37,748
I'm not seeing a heartbeat.

1213
01:23:15,202 --> 01:23:16,537
Amein.

1214
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:19,749
Hello.

1215
01:23:19,790 --> 01:23:21,876
Oh, amein.

1216
01:23:25,171 --> 01:23:26,881
How often is she out there?

1217
01:23:26,922 --> 01:23:29,800
She comes on Fridays a lot,
because she knows I'm home.

1218
01:23:32,136 --> 01:23:35,389
April... adopt a baby.

1219
01:23:35,431 --> 01:23:37,391
-How could you?
-It's the same.

1220
01:23:37,433 --> 01:23:39,518
-How would you know?
-Maybe it's better.

1221
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:41,479
You don't know what it's like
to be adopted.

1222
01:23:41,520 --> 01:23:44,190
You don't know what it's like
to not be adopted!

1223
01:23:44,231 --> 01:23:45,566
Right?

1224
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:52,406
What's it like?

1225
01:23:57,286 --> 01:23:59,080
It was exhausting.

1226
01:24:01,123 --> 01:24:03,918
It was embarrassing sometimes.

1227
01:24:16,305 --> 01:24:18,391
-Want me to bring her out some chicken?
-You can.

1228
01:24:18,432 --> 01:24:20,976
-Why don't you?
-I would like to forgive her.

1229
01:24:21,018 --> 01:24:25,481
I'm tired of being so mad.
I've tried. I can't.

1230
01:24:25,481 --> 01:24:26,857
Make her buy you something.

1231
01:24:28,067 --> 01:24:29,735
-I beg your pardon?
-She's loaded.

1232
01:24:29,777 --> 01:24:32,238
-Maybe it'll make you feel better.
-That's ridiculous.

1233
01:24:32,321 --> 01:24:34,448
Make her buy me something.

1234
01:24:34,490 --> 01:24:36,867
A car.
Yours is on its last legs.

1235
01:24:36,909 --> 01:24:39,829
A house.
A very small house.

1236
01:24:40,830 --> 01:24:44,417
Make her buy something you really want
but can't afford.

1237
01:24:55,177 --> 01:24:56,470
-I'm here.
-Ahh!

1238
01:24:57,304 --> 01:24:59,056
Jesus fucking Christ!

1239
01:24:59,098 --> 01:25:01,308
-Sorry.
-I mean...

1240
01:25:01,350 --> 01:25:03,811
...Jesus. Hm.

1241
01:25:03,853 --> 01:25:05,271
How are you?

1242
01:25:06,439 --> 01:25:07,773
Sick...

1243
01:25:08,315 --> 01:25:10,860
every day over what I did to you.

1244
01:25:10,901 --> 01:25:12,653
Good.

1245
01:25:12,695 --> 01:25:15,322
I mean, I think that's probably good.

1246
01:25:15,364 --> 01:25:17,450
Yeah, I guess so.

1247
01:25:18,534 --> 01:25:20,494
I want you to make it up to me.

1248
01:25:20,536 --> 01:25:24,331
This is for me, you understand,
not for you, for me.

1249
01:25:24,373 --> 01:25:29,211
I think I will be happier in the long run
if you try to make it up to me.

1250
01:25:29,253 --> 01:25:30,629
OK.

1251
01:25:30,671 --> 01:25:32,256
I want you to buy me a baby.

1252
01:25:33,841 --> 01:25:35,843
Oh, well, that's easy!

1253
01:25:35,885 --> 01:25:39,180
I'm plugged into all kinds of adoption.
In China they're throwing them...

1254
01:25:39,221 --> 01:25:42,933
No, I want you to buy me a baby
that I'm going to have.

1255
01:25:42,975 --> 01:25:45,519
I'm almost forty,
so I don't have much time.

1256
01:25:45,561 --> 01:25:48,355
It's very expensive.
I want you to pay for it.

1257
01:25:48,397 --> 01:25:52,985
After they do it, I have to lie still
for two hours. I hate lying still.

1258
01:25:53,027 --> 01:25:57,156
I want you to be there,
find ways to help me.

1259
01:25:57,198 --> 01:26:00,659
Twelve days later, I take a pregnancy test.
Five hours after that, I find out.

1260
01:26:00,701 --> 01:26:05,164
If you make one false move,
I'll never speak to you again.

1261
01:26:06,373 --> 01:26:11,253
If you don't, then maybe we can be
in each other's lives a little.

1262
01:26:11,253 --> 01:26:14,882
You understand
that's all that's possible right now -

1263
01:26:14,924 --> 01:26:16,884
a little.

1264
01:26:18,552 --> 01:26:20,179
Can I put my pants on?

1265
01:26:21,597 --> 01:26:23,724
"Hair -average. "

1266
01:26:23,766 --> 01:26:26,394
-As opposed to?
-Thin, thick, or balding.

1267
01:26:27,103 --> 01:26:29,355
"Artistic ability -none. "

1268
01:26:30,106 --> 01:26:31,607
-None?
-None.

1269
01:26:31,607 --> 01:26:33,442
-Jesus.
-Mm.

1270
01:26:35,319 --> 01:26:37,113
"How would you describe yourself?"

1271
01:26:37,154 --> 01:26:41,325
"Hard working, intelligent, warm,
caring, sexy, and contemplative. "

1272
01:26:42,326 --> 01:26:44,286
I'm keeping this one for me.

1273
01:26:49,458 --> 01:26:51,085
You need to just stick it.

1274
01:26:52,336 --> 01:26:56,799
-Thousands of Chinese girls...
-I'm not adopting a Chinese baby.

1275
01:26:57,800 --> 01:26:59,385
Then bend over.

1276
01:27:04,557 --> 01:27:06,392
-Is there anything I can do?
-No.

1277
01:27:07,435 --> 01:27:09,103
-Are you ready?
-Mm-hm.

1278
01:27:12,148 --> 01:27:13,524
Do you want to pray?

1279
01:27:14,483 --> 01:27:16,444
She does that. She prays.

1280
01:27:17,069 --> 01:27:20,281
-Want to say a little prayer or something?
-No.

1281
01:27:21,323 --> 01:27:23,826
-I'm so sorry to interrupt.
-What is the matter with you?

1282
01:27:23,826 --> 01:27:27,037
-Could you uh, give us a minute?
-Bernice, listen to me right now!

1283
01:27:27,079 --> 01:27:28,956
I'm sorry. Just a minute.

1284
01:27:31,709 --> 01:27:34,628
Just find us when you're ready.
We'll be around.

1285
01:27:40,426 --> 01:27:41,761
What?

1286
01:27:42,720 --> 01:27:45,264
-Why don't you wanna pray?
-What do you care?

1287
01:27:45,306 --> 01:27:49,602
I don't!
I don't give a shit, but you do!

1288
01:27:49,643 --> 01:27:53,481
You told me that. You pray
before you eat a bowl of spaghetti!

1289
01:27:53,522 --> 01:27:55,941
And now, right before
you do the most important thing

1290
01:27:55,983 --> 01:27:59,528
you'll ever do in your life,
suddenly you're not interested?

1291
01:27:59,570 --> 01:28:01,113
This is none of your business.

1292
01:28:05,701 --> 01:28:07,078
Get out of my way.

1293
01:28:07,912 --> 01:28:10,164
Say a prayer with me and I will.

1294
01:28:10,206 --> 01:28:12,083
I don't want to pray.

1295
01:28:12,124 --> 01:28:14,126
One stupid little prayer.

1296
01:28:14,168 --> 01:28:15,669
No!

1297
01:28:18,756 --> 01:28:20,091
Move!

1298
01:28:20,841 --> 01:28:22,927
Maybe you just don't want it badly enough.

1299
01:28:24,512 --> 01:28:27,681
You have no idea how badly I want it.

1300
01:28:27,723 --> 01:28:29,308
Then why won't you pray? Why?

1301
01:28:29,350 --> 01:28:33,312
Because I'm not gonna
hand this wish over to some...

1302
01:28:34,730 --> 01:28:38,818
whatever it is,
who's supposed to be loving, who...

1303
01:28:41,570 --> 01:28:42,905
who...

1304
01:28:48,494 --> 01:28:50,329
I had faith.

1305
01:28:55,584 --> 01:28:57,169
Oh.

1306
01:28:57,211 --> 01:28:59,672
I thought...

1307
01:28:59,714 --> 01:29:02,675
God was... good.

1308
01:29:06,929 --> 01:29:08,723
Maybe God is...

1309
01:29:09,932 --> 01:29:12,059
What?

1310
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:16,355
Difficult.

1311
01:29:17,398 --> 01:29:18,983
Awful.

1312
01:29:20,276 --> 01:29:21,694
Complicated.

1313
01:29:22,695 --> 01:29:24,530
Like me?

1314
01:29:24,572 --> 01:29:29,034
It took the one man on earth who's right
for me and I dropped him on his head.

1315
01:29:29,118 --> 01:29:30,578
Right.

1316
01:29:30,619 --> 01:29:32,079
You did.

1317
01:29:33,998 --> 01:29:36,250
-How are we doing?
-We're done.

1318
01:29:36,292 --> 01:29:38,669
-I'm sorry.
-No problem.

1319
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:47,386
Wait.

1320
01:29:52,516 --> 01:29:57,605
<i># Hear O Israel</i>

1321
01:29:57,646 --> 01:30:03,402
<i># the Lord our God</i>

1322
01:30:14,371 --> 01:30:16,332
<i>What does that mean?</i>

1323
01:30:16,373 --> 01:30:20,544
<i>Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God,
the Lord is One.</i>

1324
01:30:22,505 --> 01:30:24,090
<i>What does that mean?</i>

1325
01:30:24,173 --> 01:30:30,304
<i>Listen, O Israel, the God of Love
and the God of Fear are one.</i>

1326
01:31:13,055 --> 01:31:14,515
Well.

1327
01:31:14,557 --> 01:31:16,016
Hello.

1328
01:31:16,058 --> 01:31:18,644
Thank you for seeing me.

1329
01:31:18,686 --> 01:31:24,608
You're standing between me and my front
door, so, it's literally the least I could do.

1330
01:31:25,693 --> 01:31:27,528
I heard what happened.

1331
01:31:28,529 --> 01:31:31,157
I'm sorry I called the baby godforsaken.

1332
01:31:31,198 --> 01:31:33,159
It turns out she was.

1333
01:31:34,952 --> 01:31:36,287
I miss you.

1334
01:31:37,496 --> 01:31:38,998
Do you miss me?

1335
01:31:39,039 --> 01:31:40,416
What do you want, April?

1336
01:31:42,877 --> 01:31:44,879
I wanna look at you...

1337
01:31:46,088 --> 01:31:48,174
for a long, long time.

1338
01:31:49,300 --> 01:31:50,634
What else?

1339
01:31:50,676 --> 01:31:55,890
There's a chance my life may change
in a few hours. It may not, but it may...

1340
01:31:56,557 --> 01:31:58,684
and before it does,
I wanna say two things.

1341
01:31:58,726 --> 01:32:03,314
I know what I did to you.
To you in particular.

1342
01:32:04,815 --> 01:32:07,485
Like a worst nightmare kind of thing,
right?

1343
01:32:10,404 --> 01:32:11,822
I knew that.

1344
01:32:11,864 --> 01:32:13,991
Even at the time, I knew that.

1345
01:32:16,368 --> 01:32:18,871
-What else?
-I'll do it again.

1346
01:32:18,954 --> 01:32:23,584
I will.
I'll hurt you again and again.

1347
01:32:23,626 --> 01:32:24,960
Not like that.

1348
01:32:26,128 --> 01:32:29,215
You'd have to leave me
if I hurt you like that.

1349
01:32:30,174 --> 01:32:33,552
If we were together, you'd leave me
if I hurt you like that again, wouldn't you?

1350
01:32:33,594 --> 01:32:36,013
Yes. Yes, I would.

1351
01:32:36,055 --> 01:32:37,556
Good.

1352
01:32:38,974 --> 01:32:42,436
But I'll hurt you in other ways.
Little ways. I won't mean to, but I will.

1353
01:32:42,478 --> 01:32:45,064
And sometimes, I will mean to.

1354
01:32:46,440 --> 01:32:48,275
This is quite an offer you've worked up.

1355
01:32:48,317 --> 01:32:53,030
You'll hurt me, too, you know?
You'll hurt me and change on me.

1356
01:32:53,072 --> 01:32:55,866
You might leave me after you promise
you won't. How about that?

1357
01:32:55,908 --> 01:32:57,076
-I wouldn't.
-You might.

1358
01:32:57,118 --> 01:32:59,203
-But I wouldn't!
-But...

1359
01:33:00,788 --> 01:33:02,498
you might.

1360
01:33:05,167 --> 01:33:06,877
Yeah, I guess I might.

1361
01:33:09,338 --> 01:33:10,756
So?

1362
01:33:13,259 --> 01:33:15,469
-Oh, God!
-I know.

1363
01:33:16,804 --> 01:33:18,264
I'm sorry.

1364
01:33:22,476 --> 01:33:24,437
So?

1365
01:33:40,119 --> 01:33:42,788
Just need to get that little wine glass.
That's great.

1366
01:34:03,934 --> 01:34:05,770
Hey, where's your dad?

1367
01:34:18,991 --> 01:34:20,868
I got her.

1368
01:34:20,868 --> 01:34:22,495
I'll see you inside.

1369
01:34:27,333 --> 01:34:28,876
<i>There is a Jewish story.</i>

1370
01:34:28,918 --> 01:34:30,503
<i>An ordinary Jewish joke.</i>

1371
01:34:30,544 --> 01:34:35,674
<i>A father was teaching his little son
to be less afraid, to have more courage.</i>

1372
01:34:36,675 --> 01:34:39,136
<i>"Jump," he said, "and I'll catch you. "</i>

1373
01:34:40,638 --> 01:34:44,683
<i>And the little boy trusted him,
and the little boy jumped.</i>

1374
01:34:45,893 --> 01:34:49,772
<i>And when his father caught him,
he felt filled with love.</i>

1375
01:34:49,814 --> 01:34:54,485
<i>And when he didn't, he was filled with
something else -something... more.</i>

1376
01:34:56,445 --> 01:34:57,947
<i>Life.</i>

1377
01:34:59,740 --> 01:35:01,367
<i>Amein.</i>

1378
01:35:57,214 --> 01:36:03,512
# I'm gonna let you down,
I know that now

1379
01:36:03,554 --> 01:36:08,309
# Make you cry, I know I will

1380
01:36:10,269 --> 01:36:16,525
# And why should you believe
I would never leave

1381
01:36:17,860 --> 01:36:21,530
# Or that I'll be here still

1382
01:36:23,991 --> 01:36:26,827
# For all the by and by

1383
01:36:26,827 --> 01:36:30,039
# And hard as we try

1384
01:36:30,081 --> 01:36:36,253
# The bough breaks
and the cradle falls

1385
01:36:37,380 --> 01:36:43,803
# For everything I do
that will tear at you

1386
01:36:43,844 --> 01:36:50,142
# Let me say I'm sorry now

1387
01:36:50,184 --> 01:36:54,230
# So you could sing our song

1388
01:36:54,271 --> 01:36:57,191
# You can get it wrong

1389
01:36:57,233 --> 01:37:03,406
# You can kiss the rock of ages

1390
01:37:04,407 --> 01:37:07,576
# And in your wildest dreams

1391
01:37:07,618 --> 01:37:10,454
# You might see between

1392
01:37:11,497 --> 01:37:17,378
# The liars and the sages

1393
01:37:17,378 --> 01:37:21,132
# You can walk a while

1394
01:37:21,173 --> 01:37:24,176
# Down the mystery mile

1395
01:37:24,218 --> 01:37:31,225
# You can beat the drums of freedom

1396
01:37:31,267 --> 01:37:34,770
# And in love and war

1397
01:37:34,812 --> 01:37:38,149
# Through the rush and roar

1398
01:37:38,190 --> 01:37:43,320
# You just call 'em like you see 'em #

1399
01:38:06,427 --> 01:38:10,264
# Ooh, yeah, baby

1400
01:38:16,395 --> 01:38:20,274
# I wanna feel my earth turn over, babe

1401
01:38:20,274 --> 01:38:24,028
# In this hardened winter ground

1402
01:38:26,405 --> 01:38:29,784
# Feel my earth turn over, darlin'

1403
01:38:29,784 --> 01:38:33,579
# Till I'm rootless and unbound

1404
01:38:35,122 --> 01:38:39,043
# I wanna feel my body tremble

1405
01:38:39,085 --> 01:38:42,880
# When there's no one else around

1406
01:38:44,632 --> 01:38:49,470
# Just this cool, clear water runnin'

1407
01:38:49,470 --> 01:38:53,808
# In this love that I've found

1408
01:38:53,849 --> 01:38:58,813
# Hey, baby, see how it can be

1409
01:38:58,854 --> 01:39:03,275
# Every time you reveal yourself to me

1410
01:39:04,610 --> 01:39:06,487
# I'll come runnin'

1411
01:39:13,077 --> 01:39:16,664
# When I feel my baby calling now

1412
01:39:16,705 --> 01:39:20,668
# It's like a whisper in the sand

1413
01:39:22,461 --> 01:39:30,344
# When the softest rain is falling, darlin'
I will crumble in your hand

1414
01:39:31,929 --> 01:39:35,766
# Then when all that's left is wonder

1415
01:39:35,808 --> 01:39:39,895
# And no need to understand

1416
01:39:41,522 --> 01:39:45,568
# Well, this cool, clear water runnin'

1417
01:39:47,862 --> 01:39:51,157
# Will be all that I am

1418
01:39:52,742 --> 01:39:54,827
# Hey, baby

1419
01:39:55,703 --> 01:40:02,668
# Will be all that I am, all that I am

1420
01:40:05,379 --> 01:40:11,927
# Oh-oh,
ohh-ohh #

1421
01:40:11,927 --> 01:40:16,974
# O-o-o-ohh #

1422
01:40:22,146 --> 01:40:23,147
