00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:27,380
- Quite a climb...
- Kind of

10
00:01:28,021 --> 00:01:32,287
Luckily, the bus stop isn't far

11
00:01:32,425 --> 00:01:36,293
- How are you keeping?
- We're on a hill

12
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:38,693
Cab drivers get lost up here

13
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:41,096
The bus is better

14
00:01:41,234 --> 00:01:42,496
Yes

15
00:01:43,837 --> 00:01:48,069
Is this your house?
It's beautiful!

16
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:50,505
Sorry to have brought you so far

17
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:54,876
No, don't apologize
This way, I get to see your place

18
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:56,642
That's true

19
00:01:56,883 --> 00:02:02,185
Actually
the house is a real mess

20
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:04,754
my wife wants us
to go elsewhere

21
00:02:04,891 --> 00:02:11,057
- Do you mind?
- All right

22
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:16,660
- So, how are you doing?
- Good

23
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:18,668
I have a present for you

24
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:19,965
A present?

25
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:24,570
It’s not much
Now you're here

26
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,076
you may as well take a look

27
00:02:39,526 --> 00:02:42,689
You're a rich man now!

28
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:46,997
My wife is
a very determined woman

29
00:02:48,134 --> 00:02:51,103
We've settled here for good

30
00:02:51,237 --> 00:02:55,799
but a 200-million-won mortgage
the loans from relatives...

31
00:02:55,942 --> 00:02:58,308
It will take forever to pay that off

32
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,539
Well, you've certainly changed

33
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:04,547
I haven't

34
00:03:04,684 --> 00:03:08,142
The present that I mentioned

35
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:13,851
- Is this snow, the first...
- It’s a little late this year

36
00:03:13,993 --> 00:03:15,858
You can walk on it

37
00:03:18,398 --> 00:03:21,060
It’s beautiful
I kept the dog off it

38
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:22,862
You even have a dog

39
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:28,872
- Walk on it?
- If you'd like to

40
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:31,069
All right

41
00:03:48,294 --> 00:03:52,196
It will look like someone walked
just one way

42
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,698
When you went in and back out

43
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,840
- Shall we go?
- All right

44
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:04,905
Let's go

45
00:04:14,487 --> 00:04:18,048
- This is great
- You don't have a mobile?

46
00:04:18,191 --> 00:04:21,160
- I got rid of it
- Why?

47
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:25,564
I've forgotten my wallet
I'll be right back

48
00:04:25,698 --> 00:04:26,960
I'll wait here

49
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:46,578
- Who is it?
- It’s me, Open up

50
00:04:46,719 --> 00:04:48,277
- Munho?
- Yes

51
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:50,685
Munho, is that you?
Just a second

52
00:04:58,631 --> 00:05:00,826
- Thank you, Good-bye
- Thanks

53
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:12,242
- Thank you
- Good-bye

54
00:05:16,582 --> 00:05:20,450
- What was university like there?
- Hm...

55
00:05:21,387 --> 00:05:23,355
How can I put it...

56
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,352
It’s a good university
they all say so

57
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:31,054
On the staff, they have

58
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:33,665
one particularly good lecturer

59
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:35,961
I took his class in the end

60
00:05:36,102 --> 00:05:39,162
Know what he said about my film?

61
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:42,265
That it's a “gem”

62
00:05:43,109 --> 00:05:46,476
A “gem”? What's that?

63
00:05:46,612 --> 00:05:49,581
A “gem”?
A precious stone

64
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,576
A precious stone?

65
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,577
Isn’t the word “treasure”?

66
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,487
Treasure can mean stones too

67
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,817
But a lot of them

68
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,418
Gem is one stone
and “treasure” is a lot

69
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:16,433
You were wise
to change your main subject

70
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,941
You're a smart one

71
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:25,147
- Smart, me
- Every university has a film department

72
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:29,346
Dozens have opened
in the last few years

73
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:32,049
University?

74
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:35,160
I don't want to teach
I want to make films

75
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:40,960
You're right
Make films

76
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:46,970
So, you're not going to teach?

77
00:06:48,207 --> 00:06:49,970
Well...

78
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:53,272
if a university in Seoul asks me to
why not?

79
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,075
I need to making a living

80
00:06:56,916 --> 00:07:03,617
Exactly, all these film students
what will they do?

81
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:07,715
Film isn't like Korean or English

82
00:07:09,562 --> 00:07:13,521
It will be hard for them
I pity them

83
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:22,631
I'll write a screenplay first
I'll need time to adjust here

84
00:07:24,977 --> 00:07:29,038
This will make you laugh
When I went back for my wallet

85
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:33,949
my wife was smoking
in the bathroom

86
00:07:35,388 --> 00:07:36,946
Does she smoke?

87
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,224
Usually, no!
I caught her red-handed

88
00:07:42,195 --> 00:07:43,355
Really?

89
00:07:44,497 --> 00:07:47,864
But I didn't say anything

90
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,662
Before, I'd have kicked up a fuss

91
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,898
Now...

92
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,408
I see her
less as a woman or a wife

93
00:07:58,344 --> 00:08:01,040
and more as a human being

94
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:06,550
I tell her, “Live your life!”
Something like that

95
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:14,856
You're kind to her
There again, it's best not to smoke

96
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,823
When she sleeps by our kid

97
00:08:17,964 --> 00:08:20,125
she looks so beautiful

98
00:08:22,268 --> 00:08:28,036
I believe that proves
that she's a good wife

99
00:08:30,276 --> 00:08:35,441
True, you made a good match
You're lucky to have met her

100
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:43,251
By the way, if you hug my wife again
you'll hear from me!

101
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:46,753
What do you mean?

102
00:08:46,893 --> 00:08:49,453
Remember when we visited you
in the USA

103
00:08:49,595 --> 00:08:52,860
you hugged her 'American-style'

104
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:54,967
- I didn't say anything...
- Hey, that's just...

105
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:56,568
I didn't hug her...

106
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:58,363
- That's hello
- Shut your mouth!

107
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:05,202
Just don't do that!
You're not a Yankee!

108
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,715
Chili pepper noodles

109
00:09:18,858 --> 00:09:20,223
- Here you are
- Just a second, please

110
00:09:20,359 --> 00:09:21,917
- I'm sorry but...
- Huh?

111
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,326
I make films

112
00:09:25,464 --> 00:09:28,024
Are you interested in acting?

113
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,135
- Films?
- Yes

114
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:36,139
I'm a director

115
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:39,938
I'm looking for real people

116
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:43,446
to play parts in my film

117
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,850
Not for a documentary
but for a real film

118
00:09:47,787 --> 00:09:49,948
I don't think so

119
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:53,550
Why not? Don't I seem honest?

120
00:09:55,995 --> 00:09:58,156
You have an interesting face

121
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,561
That's why I'm insisting

122
00:10:03,202 --> 00:10:06,569
I'll give you my number
You'll think about it?

123
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,667
No, really
I couldn't do it

124
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:12,277
I'll leave you now

125
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,276
Come here

126
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:19,282
Is something wrong?

127
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:21,184
What did he say?

128
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,185
He's a director

129
00:10:23,322 --> 00:10:26,382
- He wants me to be in a film
- What kind of director?

130
00:10:26,926 --> 00:10:29,895
- I don't know
- He's a director?

131
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,793
- So he says
- He asked you to act?

132
00:10:32,932 --> 00:10:36,197
The idea of it!

133
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:40,999
You lack ambition
That's why life disappoints you

134
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,906
Look, he's watching you

135
00:11:39,632 --> 00:11:41,099
Hello

136
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:45,397
What are you doing here?
What's up?

137
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,804
Are you well?

138
00:11:48,941 --> 00:11:51,501
If you're not busy, we can talk...

139
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:55,270
I'd like to but...

140
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,042
Is your military service over now?

141
00:11:57,183 --> 00:12:01,085
You didn't know?

142
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:04,984
I didn't know
So, how are you?

143
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:09,390
Why don't we go somewhere
to talk?

144
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:15,292
What about?
I'm supposed to meet a friend

145
00:12:15,434 --> 00:12:18,198
You'll meet your friend

146
00:12:20,239 --> 00:12:21,900
This won't take long, come on

147
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,205
I just got out of the army

148
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:35,117
You really don't have a minute?

149
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:40,715
I know but...
Can't it wait a day?

150
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,919
I have to meet a friend

151
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:46,028
Sunhwa!

152
00:12:49,668 --> 00:12:51,226
Look at me!

153
00:12:52,571 --> 00:12:53,936
It’s me!

154
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,742
Snap out of it!

155
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,583
Don't do this to me

156
00:13:05,718 --> 00:13:08,482
I'll bring you back in no time

157
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:15,091
Quickly, then

158
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:52,126
Why do you always
keep me waiting?

159
00:13:53,465 --> 00:13:55,126
Sorry

160
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,163
What's wrong?

161
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,672
Have you been waiting long?

162
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:15,083
It’s a beautiful day

163
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:19,586
Sorry, I'm late again

164
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:23,786
What's the matter?

165
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:30,802
Yesterday...

166
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,301
I was kidnapped

167
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,008
I'm really sorry

168
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:43,915
I was kidnapped

169
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,210
and taken by force to Puchon

170
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:51,921
By whom?

171
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:58,325
A guy I know
He turned up out of the blue

172
00:14:59,265 --> 00:15:02,063
He found me
after he got out of the army

173
00:15:02,334 --> 00:15:04,666
He knew we see each other

174
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:08,467
He knew what time
I go to the hospital

175
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:10,368
He was waiting for me

176
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,374
Who is this guy?

177
00:15:17,716 --> 00:15:22,483
We used to be in the same club
at high school

178
00:15:26,225 --> 00:15:27,692
And then...

179
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:35,591
Well? What happened?

180
00:15:38,337 --> 00:15:43,798
In Puchon, he took me to a hotel

181
00:15:46,045 --> 00:15:50,004
And there, he raped me

182
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:17,371
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay...

183
00:16:35,227 --> 00:16:37,695
- Not too hot?
- It’s ok

184
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:10,590
That's enough

185
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:37,480
I'm making love to you to cleanse you
You understand?

186
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,783
I'll really be clean again?

187
00:18:16,128 --> 00:18:17,595
Of course

188
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,497
I'll make you clean

189
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:26,162
You'll be clean again

190
00:18:27,339 --> 00:18:32,709
- You understand?
- I want to be clean

191
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,381
Make me clean

192
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:01,903
- Why are you here, Dad?
- You're here?

193
00:19:02,074 --> 00:19:05,771
- You mustn't smoke
- Just one cigarette

194
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:10,913
- Is there time?
- Yes

195
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:13,715
Remember what I said

196
00:19:13,852 --> 00:19:18,312
You must be
both daring and reliable

197
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:19,822
- Yep
- You understand?

198
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,118
I understand

199
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,818
What are you doing here?

200
00:19:22,961 --> 00:19:24,428
- Hello, sir
- You're here!

201
00:19:24,563 --> 00:19:25,723
- How are you, sir?
- Good

202
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:29,527
- Why are you all alone?
- I need to talk to you

203
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,930
What about?

204
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:34,439
I'll leave you two to talk
Don't be too long

205
00:19:34,573 --> 00:19:36,040
We'll catch up

206
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,637
You can talk inside

207
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:39,243
We won't be long

208
00:19:39,378 --> 00:19:40,436
Okay

209
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:48,046
- I have to talk to you
- What's the matter?

210
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,251
One thing bothers me

211
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:55,153
Sunhwa should be here
to see you off to the USA

212
00:19:55,794 --> 00:19:56,954
Sunhwa?

213
00:19:57,095 --> 00:20:00,758
She knows you're leaving
You have to see her

214
00:20:00,899 --> 00:20:03,367
You can't just leave like this!

215
00:20:06,505 --> 00:20:08,063
What's it to do with you?

216
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:11,074
That's what you had to tell me?

217
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:14,771
I told her to come here
It’s the right thing to do

218
00:20:15,314 --> 00:20:16,474
What?

219
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:20,278
She's on her way
She'll be here soon

220
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:14,071
Come here

221
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:24,279
Take care
You'll wait for me, right?

222
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:37,384
I'll call you
Look after yourself, won't you?

223
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:41,759
I'll wait
I'll wait for your call

224
00:21:43,001 --> 00:21:44,059
All right

225
00:21:51,109 --> 00:21:54,875
Why are you crying?
Don't be silly!

226
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:58,273
All right, I'll stop crying

227
00:22:03,722 --> 00:22:04,780
I love you

228
00:22:06,925 --> 00:22:07,983
Me too

229
00:22:43,161 --> 00:22:46,221
Munho!
Do you remember Sunhwa?

230
00:22:50,469 --> 00:22:51,834
How could I forget her?

231
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:53,829
Right

232
00:22:56,775 --> 00:22:58,538
What's she doing these days?

233
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:02,675
I don't know
How could I know?

234
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:06,882
That's right
It’s been ages

235
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:15,392
You want to know?

236
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,599
I heard she runs a bar in Puchon

237
00:23:22,434 --> 00:23:23,492
What?

238
00:23:25,036 --> 00:23:29,996
A friend said he saw her
in Puchon

239
00:23:30,742 --> 00:23:32,607
It’s probably true
Why would he lie?

240
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:36,111
- You said you didn't know
- You wanted to know

241
00:23:39,451 --> 00:23:45,515
She was working in that kind of place
when she was a student

242
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:49,122
She dropped out of university

243
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:51,320
Really? Why?

244
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:52,923
I don't know

245
00:23:54,666 --> 00:23:58,432
I don't think
she's a waitress anymore

246
00:23:58,570 --> 00:24:01,767
She runs a bar in a hotel

247
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,176
How did she come to that?

248
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:08,979
I wonder

249
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,650
I can't believe it...

250
00:24:16,121 --> 00:24:20,285
- It all started from then
- What?

251
00:24:20,425 --> 00:24:23,189
These so-called “club rooms”

252
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:27,992
Half the girls are students
More than two thirds even!

253
00:24:28,834 --> 00:24:29,892
I see

254
00:24:30,735 --> 00:24:36,401
A real job is tough
and doesn't pay well

255
00:24:37,242 --> 00:24:41,201
The myth of virginity means
girls have a high price on them

256
00:24:41,346 --> 00:24:43,906
Koreans are too fond of sex

257
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:46,614
They have nothing better to do

258
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:50,910
- There's no real culture
- Right

259
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:54,423
Excuse me
I have to fetch my photos

260
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:58,427
- They're already done?
- It’s an express service

261
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:16,174
Can I have a quick word with you?

262
00:25:16,314 --> 00:25:17,576
Yes

263
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:24,380
I teach Western art
I was wondering...

264
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,287
would you like to model for me?

265
00:25:28,426 --> 00:25:29,791
Model for you?

266
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:32,988
Yes, I teach at the university

267
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:35,190
You can trust me

268
00:25:35,834 --> 00:25:39,895
I'm looking for
non-professional models

269
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,300
I see...

270
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:46,602
However, I must warn you
you'd have to pose nude

271
00:25:46,745 --> 00:25:48,804
Could you do that?

272
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:52,415
No, I couldn't

273
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:56,317
Because of the nudity?
I understand

274
00:25:57,455 --> 00:26:01,357
Let me give you my number
Think about it

275
00:26:02,193 --> 00:26:06,357
You'd make an excellent model

276
00:26:07,999 --> 00:26:12,163
No, really
I couldn't do it

277
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:13,965
I'll leave you now

278
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:19,868
Come here

279
00:26:20,812 --> 00:26:22,370
Is something wrong?

280
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,473
What's he saying?

281
00:26:25,617 --> 00:26:28,177
That he's a teacher

282
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,778
- He wants me to model
- A teacher needs a model?

283
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:34,790
- He's a painter
- Is he really?

284
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:36,587
Apparently

285
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:40,186
- That's all he said?
- I'm not going to model for him

286
00:26:41,633 --> 00:26:45,399
They don't look
like close friends

287
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:48,404
But they're knocking the drink back

288
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,701
That's why
they talk such rubbish

289
00:26:50,842 --> 00:26:52,104
You think so?

290
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:37,087
- Hello
- Hello

291
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,790
Go on in

292
00:27:40,525 --> 00:27:42,390
Are you going out?

293
00:27:42,527 --> 00:27:44,688
We won't be long

294
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:47,691
Good-bye

295
00:28:02,747 --> 00:28:06,308
- Where shall I put this?
- Over there

296
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:15,457
What is that?

297
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:19,356
An imaginary being

298
00:28:27,605 --> 00:28:29,971
What beautiful flowers!

299
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:36,471
In autumn
when I see chrysanthemums

300
00:28:36,614 --> 00:28:40,072
I feel that they have bloomed
just for me

301
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:42,980
I see

302
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:47,485
They're really beautiful
aren't they?

303
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:51,991
By the way...

304
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:56,491
May I call you by your first name?
I'm sorry?

305
00:28:59,337 --> 00:29:00,634
If you want

306
00:29:02,907 --> 00:29:04,272
All right

307
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,867
Stop it! Not so fast!

308
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,809
Get off me!

309
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:44,241
What did I just say?

310
00:29:44,315 --> 00:29:46,579
I told you to stop!

311
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,786
I didn't understand

312
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,685
Was it unpleasant?

313
00:29:58,129 --> 00:30:00,097
Couldn't you have just held me?

314
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:03,992
Men are all alike

315
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:11,400
If you'd simply held me
I could have let myself go

316
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:25,117
I'm sorry

317
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,920
It’s my fault

318
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,723
You're all animals

319
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:37,527
You and that bastard
just want sex

320
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:39,330
Real animals!

321
00:31:12,103 --> 00:31:13,866
- Hello
- Hello

322
00:31:14,005 --> 00:31:16,872
You're here?
Do you know the bride?

323
00:31:17,008 --> 00:31:19,169
The groom is an old friend

324
00:31:19,310 --> 00:31:22,473
- Are you close?
- Yeah

325
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:26,675
This morning, I was in a cafe

326
00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:28,979
and I called Sunhwa

327
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:35,287
She said she'd be at the wedding
I was coming anyway

328
00:31:35,426 --> 00:31:37,394
so it was a chance to see her

329
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:42,497
- That's a good idea
- Shall we fetch her?

330
00:31:42,634 --> 00:31:44,101
Will you do that for me?

331
00:31:44,636 --> 00:31:45,694
Thank you

332
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:48,096
She's over there

333
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:49,303
Sunhwa!

334
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,908
Congratulations
You look so pretty

335
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:03,978
They're intrigued

336
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:06,386
The groom is a friend...

337
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:11,887
- It’s a pretty wedding
- The bride's pretty too

338
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:16,291
I find you much prettier

339
00:32:18,036 --> 00:32:19,594
Don't exaggerate

340
00:32:20,738 --> 00:32:24,196
- Seen the chrysanthemums?
- I see

341
00:32:25,543 --> 00:32:27,511
They attract the bees

342
00:32:29,547 --> 00:32:32,710
Are you staying?
Are you going to the reception?

343
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,011
- Aren't you?
- No

344
00:32:35,153 --> 00:32:37,417
I have to go to see my tutor

345
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:39,885
Really?

346
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:43,824
- Do you go there often?
- No

347
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:49,133
I'm sorry you can't come

348
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:56,431
Could I see you tomorrow?

349
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:03,879
- What day is it tomorrow?
- What day?

350
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:08,281
- It’s Sunday
- That's right

351
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,387
All right, let's meet tomorrow

352
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:15,583
- Really?
- Really!

353
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:16,887
Thank you

354
00:33:18,429 --> 00:33:21,694
You're not using my first name?

355
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:24,996
I don't really feel like it

356
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:58,725
- Did it go well yesterday?
- Yes, sit down

357
00:34:05,810 --> 00:34:08,176
Your face is puffy

358
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:14,579
- It is?
- Yes, very puffy

359
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,881
Do you feel all right?

360
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:20,686
Yes...

361
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:27,891
What's that new hairstyle?

362
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:30,999
Is it horrible?

363
00:34:32,937 --> 00:34:34,302
No

364
00:34:52,957 --> 00:34:54,720
Isn’t anyone else home?

365
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:58,228
My father's in Japan
My mother will be home late

366
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:00,853
Your father's in Japan?

367
00:35:00,998 --> 00:35:05,662
He goes there
about ten times a year

368
00:35:07,305 --> 00:35:08,567
And your mother?

369
00:35:09,207 --> 00:35:12,370
When he's away
she comes home late

370
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:16,378
There's no one else here?

371
00:35:18,516 --> 00:35:21,679
My little brother
will be home late too

372
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:24,181
You needn't worry about him

373
00:35:24,822 --> 00:35:27,985
It’s better
when there's no one else

374
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,686
Well, there isn't

375
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:39,898
What's that?

376
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:43,701
That? It’s just for fun

377
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:46,901
What's inside it?
What is it?

378
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:51,105
- Are they stones?
- Pebbles

379
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,818
Are they for your work?

380
00:35:54,952 --> 00:35:59,116
No, It’s to toughen my fist

381
00:35:59,257 --> 00:36:02,749
- Toughen your fist?
- My fist

382
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:05,861
I punch it
every morning and evening

383
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:08,930
You do that?

384
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:13,163
To make me stronger

385
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:17,568
Every morning and evening?

386
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:20,573
Yes, Like this

387
00:36:57,548 --> 00:37:01,245
Your skin is so soft

388
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,486
Can I moan?

389
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:13,354
Go ahead
You can

390
00:37:22,807 --> 00:37:26,766
Your moaning sounds so sweet

391
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:35,480
Is that good?

392
00:37:36,220 --> 00:37:39,087
Very good

393
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:08,073
Sorry
I came too soon

394
00:38:10,354 --> 00:38:12,515
Are you always like that?

395
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:28,293
What?

396
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:31,895
Your legs are hairy

397
00:39:33,671 --> 00:39:37,334
I haven't shaved them for a while

398
00:39:37,475 --> 00:39:40,137
Shaving makes the hair thicker

399
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,249
I didn't know
that women shaved their legs

400
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:52,246
True, it has grown

401
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:30,683
I hear there's even more snow
in Kangwon province

402
00:40:31,228 --> 00:40:32,991
It snows often

403
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:39,198
Shall we go and see Sunhwa?

404
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:40,803
- Now?
- Yep

405
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:44,696
Ask your friend for the address

406
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:48,801
- You want to go to Puchon?
- Since it's snowing...

407
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:53,341
Let's go and see Sunhwa!

408
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:57,318
- You go I'm not going
- Why not?

409
00:40:57,455 --> 00:41:02,654
I enjoyed drinking with you
but we're pretty drunk now

410
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,761
So what?

411
00:41:04,895 --> 00:41:08,160
Your face isn't even flushed

412
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:12,167
I have some papers to mark
Sorry

413
00:41:12,837 --> 00:41:15,601
Go by yourself
Why not?

414
00:41:16,941 --> 00:41:19,603
How can you treat
an old friend like this?

415
00:41:20,444 --> 00:41:25,711
You go!
My wife doesn't feel well

416
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:29,308
- I didn't tell you before
- She doesn't feel well?

417
00:41:29,453 --> 00:41:32,013
She's a bit ill

418
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:34,715
I don't know...

419
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:40,931
I'll tell you the hotel's name

420
00:41:45,669 --> 00:41:48,729
Is she really ill?

421
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:53,339
All this is just an excuse

422
00:41:53,477 --> 00:41:55,138
Shall I call her to check?

423
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:58,248
Bastard!
What are you talking about?

424
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:05,285
I'm sorry but...
you're fishing for an excuse!

425
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:10,491
If I were you, I'd come

426
00:42:10,628 --> 00:42:13,188
We've just met up again

427
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:14,991
You can't do this to me

428
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:18,991
It’s snowing, we're drunk
where can we go like this?

429
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:21,900
Bastard

430
00:42:31,048 --> 00:42:34,313
- Do you want a sweet?
- Yes, thank you

431
00:42:42,760 --> 00:42:44,421
- Munho
- Huh?

432
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,827
What is it that you want
more than anything?

433
00:42:48,866 --> 00:42:49,924
Me?

434
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:55,534
There is one thing I want...

435
00:42:57,074 --> 00:43:01,670
It’s an old dream
Perhaps it won't come true

436
00:43:04,615 --> 00:43:06,583
But I like having this dream

437
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:11,379
I'll succeed, even if it's tough

438
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:13,947
Hunjoon!

439
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:18,687
I think our university
is the best in all of Korea

440
00:43:18,929 --> 00:43:21,295
I want to get tenure there

441
00:43:23,334 --> 00:43:25,097
That's my dream

442
00:43:31,542 --> 00:43:34,102
It will soon come true, right?

443
00:43:35,746 --> 00:43:39,011
I have no idea

444
00:43:40,351 --> 00:43:43,320
No one can really say
until it actually happens

445
00:43:43,454 --> 00:43:45,422
I can imagine

446
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:52,322
But it will come true
You'll make a good teacher

447
00:43:57,868 --> 00:43:59,028
Thank you

448
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:01,262
Sure

449
00:44:41,645 --> 00:44:44,205
It’s on the ground floor, isn't it?

450
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,406
Yes

451
00:44:45,549 --> 00:44:47,608
It must be just inside

452
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,120
It’s stupid arriving together

453
00:44:50,254 --> 00:44:52,620
I'll go, Wait here for me

454
00:44:53,257 --> 00:44:57,421
- Let's see if she's there
- That's why I'm going in

455
00:44:57,561 --> 00:44:59,119
It’s stupid going in together

456
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:01,561
Wait, I'll come back

457
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:46,876
You aren't too cold?

458
00:45:48,612 --> 00:45:51,080
Let me see!
Are they from the bar?

459
00:45:52,216 --> 00:45:54,275
Do you want to look inside?

460
00:45:55,819 --> 00:45:58,481
Is it anything special?

461
00:45:58,622 --> 00:46:01,318
It’s just a bar
without windows

462
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,023
Forget it, then

463
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:08,027
Sunhwa told me to wait for her

464
00:46:08,165 --> 00:46:12,124
- She hasn't finished yet
- Only natural for a bar

465
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:15,738
Where did she say to wait?

466
00:46:16,673 --> 00:46:18,937
Apparently, she lives nearby

467
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:25,247
I think I should wait for her
Will you be all right?

468
00:46:25,783 --> 00:46:27,944
I think I should wait for her

469
00:46:28,085 --> 00:46:30,246
What can I do? She insisted

470
00:46:31,588 --> 00:46:32,850
Let's wait, then

471
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:37,758
How long will she be?

472
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:39,658
She could be a while

473
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:43,262
Will you be okay?

474
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:51,471
Let's wait for her

475
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:52,870
You want to?

476
00:46:54,011 --> 00:46:55,171
Okay...

477
00:46:58,916 --> 00:47:00,110
Give me the matches

478
00:47:21,104 --> 00:47:22,765
Good-bye

479
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:53,059
Have you seen the time?

480
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,243
What's the matter?

481
00:48:03,180 --> 00:48:04,238
What?

482
00:48:05,449 --> 00:48:06,916
You must be tired

483
00:48:08,318 --> 00:48:09,876
You can go

484
00:48:11,321 --> 00:48:12,982
It’s late

485
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,524
What the hell
do you mean?

486
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:22,826
Eat some chicken
Come on, drink up!

487
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:41,944
I used to drink
liquor with chicken every day

488
00:48:42,085 --> 00:48:44,349
That's all Sunhwa and I ever had

489
00:48:44,488 --> 00:48:46,649
Sunhwa and you?

490
00:48:49,092 --> 00:48:54,052
Every day liquor and chicken

491
00:48:58,101 --> 00:49:00,296
It’s not very important...

492
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:05,107
But there's stuff you don't know

493
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:07,501
What?

494
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:11,813
When you left for the USA

495
00:49:11,949 --> 00:49:14,110
Sunhwa suffered a great deal

496
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:17,678
She did?

497
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:20,688
Everyone blamed you

498
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:23,924
For dumping her so cruelly

499
00:49:24,861 --> 00:49:28,319
That's all crap spread by assholes!

500
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:31,127
Fucking morons!

501
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:36,833
- Know what she told me?
- What?

502
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:43,243
That you're the worst kind of animal
She told me that one day

503
00:49:48,685 --> 00:49:49,845
Here you are!

504
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,857
- Been waiting long?
- You've come!

505
00:49:56,226 --> 00:50:00,128
- You're here!
- Shall we go? Come on

506
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:03,561
Where? You just got here

507
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:05,263
Have a drink

508
00:50:06,603 --> 00:50:12,269
I'm tired, I'm happy to see you
but let's get out of here

509
00:50:12,809 --> 00:50:14,174
Are you tired?

510
00:50:14,911 --> 00:50:17,471
Get up, I'm tired

511
00:50:18,715 --> 00:50:20,876
I hate the smell of chicken

512
00:50:21,018 --> 00:50:22,178
Really?

513
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,485
Let's go, then

514
00:50:39,136 --> 00:50:41,900
- How much do we owe?
- Just a second

515
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:47,203
Raw squid
three bottles of rice liquor

516
00:50:47,444 --> 00:50:51,210
four beers, chicken...

517
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:05,455
You really went there
this morning?

518
00:51:06,196 --> 00:51:12,362
Yes, I woke up way too early

519
00:51:14,104 --> 00:51:16,368
Why did you photograph this?

520
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:23,378
Because that's the place
where I treated you so badly

521
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:35,781
I wanted to go back
confront the past

522
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,985
and see that place again

523
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:43,395
So you admit it?

524
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:48,302
I treated you badly

525
00:51:53,043 --> 00:51:55,102
So you took these photos?

526
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,504
To show them to me?

527
00:51:59,549 --> 00:52:00,641
Yep

528
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:05,148
It made me realize
how much I miss you

529
00:52:09,192 --> 00:52:11,752
Munho helped me

530
00:52:18,502 --> 00:52:21,266
The teashop hasn't changed

531
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:24,771
It has, a little...

532
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:28,674
It’s the same outside
but the inside has changed

533
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:32,582
It looks the same

534
00:52:36,419 --> 00:52:39,081
I've been back there too

535
00:52:40,624 --> 00:52:41,784
Really?

536
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:49,995
I knew it before
but you're a funny man

537
00:52:52,235 --> 00:52:55,398
Me? Funny?

538
00:52:57,641 --> 00:52:58,903
Good

539
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:03,109
What's wrong with your tooth?

540
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:06,108
My tooth?

541
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:10,152
- It’s chipped
- He's right

542
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:17,256
You have sharp eyes
You noticed it?

543
00:53:17,894 --> 00:53:20,863
- How did that happen?
- Not so long ago...

544
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:24,558
That's my neighbor

545
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,464
She's a yoga instructor

546
00:53:31,107 --> 00:53:32,369
You're here!

547
00:53:32,509 --> 00:53:33,669
Here's my baby...

548
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:38,779
Come to mommy

549
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:40,211
Come here!

550
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:42,818
Isn’t my baby beautiful?

551
00:53:43,653 --> 00:53:45,120
Is she yours?

552
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:47,821
- My baby... Isn’t she beautiful?
- She's big

553
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:50,324
You have to obey Mummy

554
00:53:53,263 --> 00:53:57,029
- You peed in her house?
- Yes, I scolded her

555
00:53:57,867 --> 00:54:00,461
- What's her name?
- Mary

556
00:54:00,837 --> 00:54:02,737
- She's excited
- Mary...

557
00:54:04,708 --> 00:54:06,869
- Mary, come here
- Be careful

558
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,773
- Mary
- Be good

559
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:11,073
She's excited

560
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:16,176
She's so dark black dog!

561
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:18,480
Mary, the black dog

562
00:54:19,522 --> 00:54:22,184
Hey, that hurts
Let go

563
00:54:42,412 --> 00:54:43,572
Sunhwa

564
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:48,374
Are you happy?

565
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:54,182
I have no idea
What does that mean?

566
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:02,724
It’s been a while, you and me

567
00:55:05,068 --> 00:55:07,036
You must be happy

568
00:55:07,871 --> 00:55:12,535
You look good
Have you put on weight?

569
00:55:20,383 --> 00:55:22,749
Did you bring Hunjoon here?

570
00:55:23,887 --> 00:55:28,347
I was the one
who wanted to come

571
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:30,851
Why?

572
00:55:34,297 --> 00:55:35,662
I don't know

573
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:42,770
It was snowing and...
that made me sentimental

574
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:47,367
Stop it

575
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:53,877
- Sunhwa
- What?

576
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:57,680
I'll buy some food
There's nothing left here

577
00:55:58,321 --> 00:56:01,313
Are you going alone?

578
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:04,927
Hunjoon is drunk

579
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:08,428
- Hunjoon, are you okay?
- I'm okay

580
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:11,534
Put him to bed I won't be long

581
00:56:34,591 --> 00:56:36,650
Stop drinking!

582
00:56:38,995 --> 00:56:40,360
Yeah

583
00:56:46,703 --> 00:56:49,171
What are you trying to prove?

584
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:54,273
Give me that

585
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:03,779
Burn me

586
00:57:05,622 --> 00:57:07,089
Burn me!

587
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:11,587
Burn me!

588
00:57:13,630 --> 00:57:15,495
Somebody burn me!

589
00:57:16,232 --> 00:57:20,396
Burn me! Burn me!

590
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:26,808
You want me to do it?

591
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:50,966
You know how I waited for you?

592
00:57:54,604 --> 00:57:57,869
Do you have any idea
how I waited?

593
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:05,547
You waited for me?

594
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:11,912
Is that true?

595
01:00:01,197 --> 01:00:02,858
Are you awake?

596
01:00:03,499 --> 01:00:05,160
Give me a minute

597
01:00:27,423 --> 01:00:29,687
Did I wake you?

598
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:46,106
Will you suck me off?

599
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:52,200
That felt so good

600
01:01:52,341 --> 01:01:53,501
Thank you

601
01:01:56,946 --> 01:01:59,107
You like the way it feels?

602
01:02:02,085 --> 01:02:03,143
Yes

603
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:07,151
It’s my tooth

604
01:02:58,841 --> 01:03:00,331
You're awake?

605
01:03:00,476 --> 01:03:02,341
You're already up

606
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:07,143
- What's that?
- Do you like kim chi stew?

607
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:09,751
I've added some tuna to it

608
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:13,049
My favorite dish!
How did you know?

609
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:14,656
Is that so?

610
01:03:17,093 --> 01:03:21,860
I don't remember

611
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:26,862
You're up?

612
01:03:30,606 --> 01:03:32,267
I'm making stew

613
01:03:35,311 --> 01:03:36,676
Give me some water

614
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:39,679
Are you hung over?

615
01:03:45,421 --> 01:03:46,979
Me too

616
01:03:56,465 --> 01:03:58,228
Is this really you?

617
01:04:06,342 --> 01:04:08,310
Mary, come and eat

618
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:36,231
It’s cold today

619
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:39,236
It’s warmer than yesterday

620
01:04:56,492 --> 01:04:58,756
- Kick the ball
- Can you kick it?

621
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:04,996
Sir! What a surprise!

622
01:05:05,134 --> 01:05:08,001
- What are you doing?
- Playing soccer

623
01:05:08,137 --> 01:05:09,798
What brings you here?

624
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:13,604
They're all on the stands

625
01:05:14,243 --> 01:05:18,304
- What are you here for?
- I'm here with friends

626
01:05:18,447 --> 01:05:20,312
- Are they my students?
- Yes

627
01:05:20,449 --> 01:05:24,010
They've come for
my son's birthday

628
01:05:24,153 --> 01:05:26,018
- They came with me
- Is that so?

629
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:29,622
I have to go
Let's have a drink after

630
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:31,727
Wait for us
They'll be pleased

631
01:05:32,461 --> 01:05:35,191
Quite a crowd

632
01:05:35,665 --> 01:05:37,030
Sungwoon, come on!

633
01:05:38,067 --> 01:05:40,035
Excuse me, I have to go

634
01:05:40,169 --> 01:05:42,330
Wait for us
Go and say hello to them

635
01:05:42,471 --> 01:05:43,335
All right

636
01:05:46,475 --> 01:05:48,534
- Are they your students?
- Yes

637
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:54,841
I'm not coming to the spring

638
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:56,709
Go ahead without me

639
01:05:57,753 --> 01:05:59,015
If you want

640
01:06:02,491 --> 01:06:05,756
- You're staying?
- Yep

641
01:06:07,596 --> 01:06:10,463
We'll bring you back
some spring water

642
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:44,793
- Sir, put this on
- I don't need it

643
01:06:44,934 --> 01:06:46,595
I pinched it for you

644
01:06:46,736 --> 01:06:49,500
Why are you staying here, sir?
Go with them

645
01:06:50,539 --> 01:06:52,507
Shall I send them over?

646
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:55,906
No, it's okay, I'm fine

647
01:06:56,045 --> 01:06:58,411
Go and play I'll see them later

648
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:00,037
Okay

649
01:07:35,017 --> 01:07:38,077
- You took your time
- Why are you alone?

650
01:07:38,220 --> 01:07:40,085
Sir, you're very elegant

651
01:07:40,523 --> 01:07:43,083
I have to go
My friends are waiting

652
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:47,491
- Having fun? Not too cold?
- I'm not cold, sir

653
01:07:47,630 --> 01:07:49,393
Sir, buy us a drink!

654
01:07:49,532 --> 01:07:53,195
- A drink? It’s too early
- Come on!

655
01:07:53,335 --> 01:07:56,600
- Come and sit down
- All right

656
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:01,940
- Sir, sit here
- Thank you

657
01:08:11,487 --> 01:08:15,048
- Thank you
- What brings you here?

658
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:18,558
- I had to come here yesterday
- What?

659
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:21,358
You saw my friends earlier?

660
01:08:21,497 --> 01:08:22,555
No

661
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:27,763
They wanted to return to their past

662
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:30,468
I helped them

663
01:08:31,507 --> 01:08:33,168
Do you have a problem?

664
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:36,870
No, if you're here
everything's fine

665
01:08:39,615 --> 01:08:42,482
- Do I sound stupid?
- Not at all

666
01:08:42,618 --> 01:08:46,486
You're the most intelligent person
I know

667
01:08:46,622 --> 01:08:48,886
Really? You flatter me

668
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:52,690
- Sir, put this on
- Keep it

669
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:54,989
I'm not cold

670
01:08:55,131 --> 01:08:56,894
For a second, then

671
01:09:05,474 --> 01:09:07,442
It smells nice

672
01:09:12,181 --> 01:09:14,046
Very nice

673
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:20,679
Really very nice

674
01:09:40,309 --> 01:09:44,370
Sir, come on
they've already left

675
01:09:44,513 --> 01:09:47,073
- Is it over?
- Yes

676
01:09:47,216 --> 01:09:50,982
The cold made them hungry
They've left, Forgive them

677
01:09:52,621 --> 01:09:56,580
Kim Wook! What are you doing?
Our teacher's here

678
01:09:57,626 --> 01:10:02,188
Come with us
What about your friends?

679
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:06,597
I won't bother waiting
Are you eating now?

680
01:10:06,735 --> 01:10:08,703
Yes, to start with

681
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:11,602
I'll come with you, then

682
01:10:12,641 --> 01:10:14,199
- Hello
- Are you well?

683
01:10:14,343 --> 01:10:15,901
- Yeah
- Hi

684
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:17,307
Hello

685
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:52,036
We took too long
Isn’t that his bottle?

686
01:10:53,582 --> 01:10:55,049
He has left

687
01:10:57,286 --> 01:10:59,652
He must have been angry

688
01:11:00,923 --> 01:11:02,584
Does he have a reason to wait?

689
01:11:04,226 --> 01:11:08,390
What's the matter with you?

690
01:11:08,530 --> 01:11:11,693
Why are you being so mean?

691
01:11:16,338 --> 01:11:17,396
I'm being mean?

692
01:11:20,242 --> 01:11:23,211
Okay, I'll go
See you later

693
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:26,314
Hunjoon! Hunjoon!

694
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:32,520
Isn’t that a bit easy?

695
01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:40,722
It’s not easy
You treated me badly

696
01:11:40,863 --> 01:11:43,730
I didn't sleep, not a wink!

697
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:52,431
- Hunjoon!
- Stop it!

698
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:03,210
You should do that

699
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:08,484
- Can you read palms?
- When I drink, it happens

700
01:12:09,224 --> 01:12:11,089
A fortune-teller told me

701
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:13,888
I had to obey men

702
01:12:14,830 --> 01:12:15,990
Really?

703
01:12:17,933 --> 01:12:22,199
People read palms their own way

704
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:24,397
According to who they are
and the lines change...

705
01:12:24,506 --> 01:12:26,565
Who hasn't answered?

706
01:12:27,643 --> 01:12:28,803
Your turn, Kyunghee

707
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:34,807
Here's my question
It’s always the same

708
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:40,618
The last time you had sex
when was that?

709
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:43,418
Who with?
What was it like?

710
01:12:43,559 --> 01:12:46,027
Always the same questions

711
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:48,220
- What?
- I'm not criticizing you

712
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:53,929
- Ask something else
- Answer, now that I've asked

713
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:00,968
It was two days ago

714
01:13:01,910 --> 01:13:04,378
I had been drinking

715
01:13:04,513 --> 01:13:08,574
He really seemed to want it
I followed him

716
01:13:08,717 --> 01:13:13,484
I didn't feel much
The place was pretty filthy

717
01:13:13,622 --> 01:13:15,180
I envy him

718
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:19,492
Drink up and ask a question

719
01:13:19,628 --> 01:13:21,493
You're being pretty coarse

720
01:13:23,432 --> 01:13:27,994
So what are you?
You're not coarse?

721
01:13:29,138 --> 01:13:33,006
You're classy?
What does that mean?

722
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:36,600
I just wanted to say

723
01:13:36,745 --> 01:13:39,805
that you're being coarse

724
01:13:39,948 --> 01:13:42,109
not that I'm classy

725
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:46,517
What does classy mean?

726
01:13:46,655 --> 01:13:48,816
I'm classy

727
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:51,719
Asshole!

728
01:13:53,061 --> 01:13:56,224
You think you're classy
with your borrowed ideas?

729
01:13:58,467 --> 01:14:00,594
Have you read a lot?

730
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:05,866
The books you've read
are the remains of the dead

731
01:14:06,708 --> 01:14:09,074
They're their self-justification

732
01:14:09,211 --> 01:14:11,270
Their self-promotion!

733
01:14:13,015 --> 01:14:14,482
At least know

734
01:14:14,616 --> 01:14:17,676
what you're talking about!

735
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:20,288
What do you know?
What do we know?

736
01:14:20,422 --> 01:14:22,287
What are we sure of?

737
01:14:24,326 --> 01:14:26,692
Shit, why act so smart?

738
01:14:26,829 --> 01:14:29,593
Fucking admit you know nothing!

739
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:35,593
You think you're the only one
who thinks that?

740
01:14:35,737 --> 01:14:36,897
What?

741
01:14:42,411 --> 01:14:43,878
I'm not saying that

742
01:14:44,346 --> 01:14:47,713
How can you believe in nothing?

743
01:14:49,251 --> 01:14:54,120
Believing in nothing
is nothing to be proud of!

744
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:58,925
Is there another way to be happy?

745
01:15:00,996 --> 01:15:03,464
How do you think
we can be happy?

746
01:15:05,200 --> 01:15:08,966
Sir! Why are you so pompous

747
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:12,073
when girls are around?

748
01:15:15,811 --> 01:15:19,178
I didn't mean to annoy you

749
01:15:20,716 --> 01:15:22,877
but you have a problem

750
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:01,045
Sir!

751
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:13,563
It’s you! Why did you leave?

752
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,166
It’s over anyway

753
01:16:16,305 --> 01:16:20,366
I thought you'd come this way
I was right

754
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:24,609
You've had a lot to drink

755
01:16:24,813 --> 01:16:29,773
No, I want to have a drink
with you

756
01:16:29,918 --> 01:16:33,979
Now? More drinking?

757
01:16:34,122 --> 01:16:38,991
Just tonight I promise
I'd like that

758
01:16:43,632 --> 01:16:46,100
What am I going to do with you?

759
01:16:50,138 --> 01:16:55,303
No, not like that
I like honesty

760
01:16:58,146 --> 01:17:00,842
You're an honest man

761
01:17:00,983 --> 01:17:05,750
Determined
I like that

762
01:17:10,392 --> 01:17:11,552
Are you coming?

763
01:17:20,902 --> 01:17:24,861
Just tonight I promise

764
01:17:40,122 --> 01:17:41,783
That's a motel

765
01:17:43,625 --> 01:17:44,785
Kyunghee!

766
01:17:47,829 --> 01:17:51,993
I want to go in there
What about you?

767
01:17:54,036 --> 01:17:56,596
That suits me, sir

768
01:17:57,739 --> 01:17:58,797
Really?

769
01:18:00,475 --> 01:18:01,737
Well then...

770
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:04,939
Let's go

771
01:18:41,416 --> 01:18:43,281
This isn't what I imagined

772
01:18:46,521 --> 01:18:48,386
It’s really tiny

773
01:18:56,131 --> 01:19:00,227
It’s really filthy
You can't even sit down

774
01:19:04,773 --> 01:19:10,336
Sir, do you want me
to suck you off?

775
01:19:14,282 --> 01:19:15,840
Actually...

776
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:24,452
I'll suck you off

777
01:21:22,244 --> 01:21:24,405
No one's there, Who was it?

778
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:30,412
I think it was him
I think it was Minsoo

779
01:21:31,853 --> 01:21:35,118
Minsoo?
Who's Minsoo?

780
01:21:36,258 --> 01:21:39,125
The one who annoyed you earlier

781
01:21:41,162 --> 01:21:44,427
Him? His name's Minsoo?

782
01:21:45,967 --> 01:21:47,628
He came this far?

783
01:21:48,970 --> 01:21:53,737
When my phone rang
it was him

784
01:22:02,017 --> 01:22:03,678
Why did he do that?

785
01:22:05,520 --> 01:22:10,287
That's the way he is
He's a shit-stirrer

786
01:22:14,429 --> 01:22:15,987
Really?

787
01:22:17,132 --> 01:22:18,997
I think so, anyhow

788
01:22:20,235 --> 01:22:23,602
He's weird
always following me around

789
01:22:53,668 --> 01:22:57,832
What do we do now?
It’s a problem for you

790
01:23:02,310 --> 01:23:04,870
If you see him
at university tomorrow

791
01:23:05,013 --> 01:23:07,880
Perhaps you'll find out more

792
01:23:09,617 --> 01:23:14,384
He'll end up mentioning it
You'll let me know?

793
01:23:14,522 --> 01:23:17,582
Of course
Only natural

794
01:23:20,228 --> 01:23:24,892
If you don't see him tomorrow
and you call him

795
01:23:25,033 --> 01:23:28,696
Do you think he'd find that odd?

796
01:23:29,037 --> 01:23:31,005
Probably

797
01:23:31,139 --> 01:23:34,802
I never call him

798
01:23:35,643 --> 01:23:37,611
But don't worry

799
01:23:37,746 --> 01:23:41,307
I'll see him in class
tomorrow or the day after

800
01:23:42,450 --> 01:23:47,979
But what if he tells someone
before then?

801
01:23:48,656 --> 01:23:53,116
Would he do that
knowing that I'm involved?

802
01:23:55,363 --> 01:23:58,230
I think he'll talk to me first

803
01:23:59,467 --> 01:24:00,764
What's his name again?

804
01:24:00,902 --> 01:24:04,360
Minsoo
He has attended your class

805
01:24:04,906 --> 01:24:06,271
I don't remember

806
01:24:07,609 --> 01:24:09,474
My memory's not very good

807
01:24:13,915 --> 01:24:17,783
Here's a taxi I'll go first

808
01:24:21,623 --> 01:24:24,683
Go ahead
Take care

809
01:24:24,826 --> 01:24:25,986
Good-bye
