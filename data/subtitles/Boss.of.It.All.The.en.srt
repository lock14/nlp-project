1
00:00:11,647 --> 00:00:16,437
What follows is a movie and 
if it seems strange already... 

2
00:00:16,847 --> 00:00:19,645
...you'll have to wait,
cause everyone can see that.

3
00:00:20,287 --> 00:00:23,085
You may only see my reflection,
but believe me...

4
00:00:23,287 --> 00:00:26,279
...this movie is not worth 
the reflection of a moment.

5
00:00:26,487 --> 00:00:31,277
This fiw is a comedy, therefore harmless.
No preaching, no teaching.

6
00:00:31,847 --> 00:00:37,046
Just a fun way to spend time.
Why not be playfull with art?

7
00:00:38,047 --> 00:00:42,837
Here we have an efficient
unemployed actor 

8
00:00:44,287 --> 00:00:47,484
...who miraculously got a job.

9
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:49,844
A very special job.

10
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:58,082
“We finally meet.
I’m the president of the company”.

11
00:00:58,487 --> 00:01:00,682
“ I’m the president of the company”.

12
00:01:00,847 --> 00:01:03,839
 “I authorized Mr Ravn 
to close the deal”. 

13
00:01:04,847 --> 00:01:07,236
 “Hello again”... 
Optional.

14
00:01:08,647 --> 00:01:11,445
-Kristoffer? Are you nervous?
-No

15
00:01:12,647 --> 00:01:16,435
Let’s get it over with it.
Sign that you wont reveal a thing.

16
00:01:18,047 --> 00:01:20,436
You said you’ve never wrote a play?

17
00:01:22,647 --> 00:01:27,437
May I ask why? Your prose is 
well formed and strong.

18
00:01:28,487 --> 00:01:31,684
-But it says too much.
-Really? 

19
00:01:33,287 --> 00:01:36,677
I hoped you’d say as little as possible.

20
00:01:37,487 --> 00:01:40,877
The penalty is heavy but 
that’s the law for you..

21
00:01:42,287 --> 00:01:45,279
The most important thing 
is to keep it a secret.

22
00:01:46,287 --> 00:01:49,085
-A Secret?
-You must be used to it.

23
00:01:49,487 --> 00:01:54,083
You do not shot someone on stage 
and say “it’s not for real” to the audience.

24
00:01:57,047 --> 00:01:58,844
I’m not so sure.

25
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:03,678
This phrase would easily fit 
a non-character created by Gambini.

26
00:02:05,047 --> 00:02:09,040
-I’m your man Ravn.
-Perfect. You’d be the boss.

27
00:02:09,487 --> 00:02:11,478
I’m a bit pushy...

28
00:02:12,047 --> 00:02:16,643
...because no one 
can see the real boss.

29
00:02:16,847 --> 00:02:20,237
We have to act now. 
Icelanders are really pressing.

30
00:02:20,847 --> 00:02:22,644
It wont take too long...

31
00:02:23,647 --> 00:02:26,445
...and you’ll make a bundle...

32
00:02:28,647 --> 00:02:31,844
...a good thing since you’re 
out of work. Sign here.

33
00:02:32,487 --> 00:02:35,684
I’m not taking the job just to work.

34
00:02:37,487 --> 00:02:42,242
-It’s nothing illegal.
-I don’t care if it is or not.

35
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,481
I’m an actor.

36
00:02:43,847 --> 00:02:47,840
The character is my law 
and the script my courtroom

37
00:02:48,487 --> 00:02:51,684
Courtroom? 
Let’s hope we won’t end up there.

38
00:02:55,047 --> 00:02:57,641
Perfect...
Here’s your pay.

39
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:03,241
-What’s on your forehead?
-Ash.

40
00:03:03,847 --> 00:03:08,443
I always rely on Gambini.
Never fails. 

41
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:10,046
“The Hanged Cat?”

42
00:03:10,287 --> 00:03:12,482
The chimney sweepers monologue…

43
00:03:12,647 --> 00:03:14,842
...from “City Without Chimneys”.

44
00:03:15,047 --> 00:03:18,437
-Do you know it?
-I know only the  “First Cat”.

45
00:03:19,047 --> 00:03:23,837
“Reluctantly I made 
a long journey to this town” 

46
00:03:25,287 --> 00:03:28,279
Our president cannot 
have ash on his forehead.

47
00:03:28,647 --> 00:03:33,437
A character is formed 
by the elements he lacks.   

48
00:03:33,647 --> 00:03:38,437
Theatre unfolds beyond 
the point where a play ends.  

49
00:03:42,847 --> 00:03:44,838
Don’t make me nervous Kristoffer.

50
00:03:46,487 --> 00:03:48,876
Lets keep things simple.

51
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:54,837
I endow my character 
with a tribute to Gambini. 

52
00:03:55,047 --> 00:03:59,040
It doesn’t matter. 
You’ll be my boss only for a second. 

53
00:03:59,647 --> 00:04:04,038
Then there are the pauses.
Pivotal to our comprehension of the play. 

54
00:04:04,647 --> 00:04:07,036
He even could speak no words at all. 

55
00:04:11,047 --> 00:04:13,436
You have to say what’s on the page. 

56
00:04:13,847 --> 00:04:17,044
Otherwise what’s the point. 
Only what’s on the page.

57
00:04:18,287 --> 00:04:21,085
 We finally meet. 
I’m the company president. 

58
00:04:23,847 --> 00:04:25,644
I finally found him.

59
00:04:27,287 --> 00:04:31,075
-This is Finnur...
-Finner... Finor...

60
00:04:35,487 --> 00:04:39,480
We finally meet. 
I’m the company president.

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:47,074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

62
00:04:48,047 --> 00:04:51,244
We finally meet. 
I’m the company president.

63
00:04:59,847 --> 00:05:02,441
You’re both company presidents.

64
00:05:03,647 --> 00:05:06,844
But for two different companies.

65
00:05:18,647 --> 00:05:21,036
Why Danish people talk so much?

66
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:25,280
That’s why the country is at an
intellectual dead-end for 200 years.

67
00:05:29,647 --> 00:05:33,037
They either talk too much
or are way too sentimental. 

68
00:05:33,487 --> 00:05:36,081
The rest of the time they 
just laugh idiotically.

69
00:05:41,287 --> 00:05:44,279
For God’s sake, let’s begin Mr Ravn.

70
00:05:45,847 --> 00:05:47,439
Dear Mr. president...

71
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:50,436
...and I’m referring to our own president...

72
00:05:52,047 --> 00:05:54,641
We’re happy to at least have one. 

73
00:05:58,487 --> 00:06:00,079
I want to say this...

74
00:06:01,847 --> 00:06:06,637
Our president asked to be 
excluded from the negotiations.

75
00:06:07,287 --> 00:06:08,879
Did I understand that right?

76
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:12,676
Price is our priority 
and we have already agreed on that.

77
00:06:13,287 --> 00:06:16,085
And we have already agreed on that.
.

78
00:06:23,287 --> 00:06:24,481
I have...

79
00:06:26,847 --> 00:06:28,838
...authorized...

80
00:06:33,647 --> 00:06:35,046
...Mr...

81
00:06:47,047 --> 00:06:48,241
...Ravn.

82
00:06:53,487 --> 00:06:56,285
Excuse me...
I didn’t got that.

83
00:06:57,647 --> 00:06:59,842
The pauses got me confused.

84
00:07:00,647 --> 00:07:03,639
Could you repeat it a bit faster? 

85
00:07:06,847 --> 00:07:09,441
I authorized Mr. Ravn.

86
00:07:15,847 --> 00:07:20,443
When the president decides something, 
you can’t change his mind .

87
00:07:23,847 --> 00:07:25,439
Mr president...

88
00:07:25,847 --> 00:07:29,044
Way too many presidents. 
Should we call ours the Dane president? 

89
00:07:32,047 --> 00:07:34,436
Icelander or Dane, it’s the same thing

90
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:41,437
-400 years of Icelandic occupation .
-It was the other way round.

91
00:07:41,487 --> 00:07:43,876
It didn’t feltl like that to us.

92
00:07:50,287 --> 00:07:53,279
I’d better return to the USA.

93
00:07:56,487 --> 00:08:00,082
Just because I’m signing on the 12th...

94
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:03,445
...it doesn’t mean that I can’t have fun. 

95
00:08:09,487 --> 00:08:11,876
Fucking Danes! 
You wont get away that easy!

96
00:08:15,287 --> 00:08:17,881
You’re all talk.

97
00:08:23,287 --> 00:08:26,882
Thankfully our sagas
taught us those words.

98
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:29,641
He who negotiates with straw men...

99
00:08:30,047 --> 00:08:32,436
...negotiates with nobody.

100
00:08:33,487 --> 00:08:34,476
Goodbye.

101
00:08:42,287 --> 00:08:44,278
I insist that your president ..

102
00:08:45,287 --> 00:08:48,484
...should meet me on the 12th.
Not his straw man. 

103
00:08:53,647 --> 00:08:56,445
He has to be here that week… 

104
00:08:56,847 --> 00:08:58,246
... or there’s no deal.

105
00:08:58,647 --> 00:09:01,036
My lawyers will contact you.

106
00:09:01,487 --> 00:09:03,876
Goodbye then... Optional.

107
00:09:08,647 --> 00:09:11,445
We finally meet.
I’m the company’s president.

108
00:09:20,647 --> 00:09:24,037
Damn!
They shouldn’t have seen you!

109
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:29,437
-The news will travel.
-They know I’m fake.

110
00:09:30,487 --> 00:09:35,083
-They didn’t tell Finnur ...
-That’s not thw problem. .

111
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:38,684
They were shocked because 
they believed you were the president.

112
00:09:41,647 --> 00:09:43,638
I played the part good.

113
00:09:44,287 --> 00:09:48,883
Even though you gave me no clues.

114
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,641
It’s the interpretation that matters.

115
00:09:54,647 --> 00:09:59,243
Likeness doesn’t play that big a part. 

116
00:10:02,647 --> 00:10:04,239
They’ve never seen him.

117
00:10:07,047 --> 00:10:09,242
-They’ve never seen him?
-No.

118
00:10:10,847 --> 00:10:14,840
-I do not understand.
-If I wasn’t that scared...

119
00:10:15,047 --> 00:10:18,437
A company needs a president. 
But I didn’t had it in me. 

120
00:10:19,847 --> 00:10:22,645
I couldn’t see myself like that. 

121
00:10:23,847 --> 00:10:27,635
When I started the company 
I told them I was just an employee.

122
00:10:29,487 --> 00:10:33,480
That the president had many companies 
and that he lived in the states. 

123
00:10:34,287 --> 00:10:38,280
It sounds strange and suspicious.
A boss I invented.

124
00:10:40,487 --> 00:10:44,275
Everything was perfect till the moment
that someone wanted to talk to him. 

125
00:10:44,647 --> 00:10:48,037
And now it’s this fucking Icelander. 
He trusts nobody. 

126
00:10:51,487 --> 00:10:54,877
Absurd... 
They called Gambini absurd as well. 

127
00:10:55,487 --> 00:10:59,480
Listen... I told you I’m your man.

128
00:11:00,487 --> 00:11:04,082
I’m not just anybody.
I’m an actor.

129
00:11:05,047 --> 00:11:08,039
That’s what you need 
so that this thing will work out.

130
00:11:12,647 --> 00:11:15,241
It’s only a week.
I’ll make a contract..

131
00:11:15,647 --> 00:11:19,242
-There’s no need for it.
-I’m doing it as a hobby.

132
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:24,443
This deal is vital for the company. 
Even the slightest doubt...

133
00:11:25,847 --> 00:11:30,637
I can sense doubt in my audiences mind.

134
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:36,077
-You’ll meet the staff.
-It’s all part of the job.

135
00:11:39,847 --> 00:11:44,045
-If you tell anyone, you’re dead!
-Stop making a fuss.

136
00:11:48,647 --> 00:11:52,242
Heidi A.? 
Could you call the managers?

137
00:11:53,487 --> 00:11:55,478
I want you to meet someone.

138
00:11:57,487 --> 00:11:59,876
These are the six people I started with.

139
00:12:08,647 --> 00:12:10,842
He’s here finally...
The boss of it all.

140
00:12:16,647 --> 00:12:21,038
He’ll spend a week with us in Denmark. 

141
00:12:23,047 --> 00:12:27,040
Maybe because, deep down he’s still a Dane. 

142
00:12:30,047 --> 00:12:34,837
And maybe he feels 
that he has…if not “abandon”… 

143
00:12:35,047 --> 00:12:39,245
...surely neglected our firm. 

144
00:12:39,847 --> 00:12:41,838
Yes that’s understandable.

145
00:12:45,487 --> 00:12:47,079
It’s understandable.

146
00:12:47,647 --> 00:12:49,842
Yes,  that  is understandable. 

147
00:12:50,487 --> 00:12:52,876
So you have a lot to talk about.

148
00:12:57,287 --> 00:13:00,484
I think I’ll just retreat…

149
00:13:02,847 --> 00:13:05,236
...and crawl back to my desk.

150
00:13:18,287 --> 00:13:19,879
Any questions 

151
00:13:21,287 --> 00:13:22,686
What is your name?

152
00:13:24,487 --> 00:13:26,478
-My name?
-Yes

153
00:13:27,847 --> 00:13:30,236
Everybody calls you
 The boss of it all”.

154
00:13:30,487 --> 00:13:33,877
Some of the girls had the hounour...

155
00:13:34,287 --> 00:13:38,280
...to receive a mail with specific instructions.

156
00:13:39,847 --> 00:13:42,645
I want to make clear
 that I randomly chose…

157
00:13:43,047 --> 00:13:47,040
... the people I was contacting with 
all these years.

158
00:13:48,047 --> 00:13:50,641
I have no preferenaces.

159
00:13:51,047 --> 00:13:54,835
My god ... You have to be very carefull.

160
00:13:55,847 --> 00:13:58,839
-His name is Svend.
-Svend E.

161
00:13:59,847 --> 00:14:03,840
That was the name on the e-mails.
What does  Å  stands for?

162
00:14:06,647 --> 00:14:09,445
I didn’t write it?
Didn’t Ravn tell you what it is? 

163
00:14:10,047 --> 00:14:12,242
In all these ten years?
Never? 

164
00:14:13,647 --> 00:14:16,445
Thatt’ good news because it means...

165
00:14:19,487 --> 00:14:22,479
...that I can say I have a name I like...

166
00:14:23,847 --> 00:14:25,838
...and I’m proud of it.

167
00:14:27,487 --> 00:14:28,681
Eker....

168
00:14:30,487 --> 00:14:34,878
Ekersberg.
Svend Ekersberg

169
00:14:38,287 --> 00:14:42,678
-How should we address you?
-Gorm would like to call you Svend.

170
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:46,244
Gorm can calls me by any name he likes. 

171
00:14:46,847 --> 00:14:49,839
He can even call me Kristoffer. 

172
00:14:52,287 --> 00:14:54,676
Why call you Kristoffer?

173
00:14:54,847 --> 00:14:58,044
Why should he do that?
Why on earth he should do that?

174
00:14:59,047 --> 00:15:01,845
-Please call me Svend.
-Ok Svend.

175
00:15:02,847 --> 00:15:04,838
I would like to say one thing.

176
00:15:07,047 --> 00:15:09,845
Autumn in the country is gloomy. 

177
00:15:10,287 --> 00:15:13,279
Really gloomy!
I want you to know that.

178
00:15:14,487 --> 00:15:18,275
People believe that autumn is refreshing.

179
00:15:20,647 --> 00:15:21,841
No, Gorm!

180
00:15:25,487 --> 00:15:27,682
-Are you done?
-Everything’s ok?

181
00:15:30,647 --> 00:15:33,241
-Are you done?
-Yes. Sorry.

182
00:15:34,287 --> 00:15:36,278
Everything’s fine

183
00:15:41,647 --> 00:15:42,841
Stop!

184
00:15:47,647 --> 00:15:49,239
That was a strong hit!

185
00:15:51,487 --> 00:15:54,285
I’m afraid that you’ll have to apologize.

186
00:15:55,047 --> 00:15:57,436
Apologize to him?

187
00:16:00,047 --> 00:16:02,641
Don’t forget the tech meeting tomorrow.

188
00:16:04,287 --> 00:16:05,879
Tech meeting...

189
00:16:13,047 --> 00:16:14,844
Ravn...
They’re all completely crazy

190
00:16:16,647 --> 00:16:20,242
-We have to speak.
-On neutral ground!

191
00:16:31,047 --> 00:16:34,437
If my character’s name is Svend for instance…

192
00:16:34,487 --> 00:16:36,284
...that’s something I would like to know.

193
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,676
-I want to be informed.
-Of course.

194
00:16:41,487 --> 00:16:43,876
Name do not really matter.

195
00:16:44,647 --> 00:16:48,640
Gorm is from the country. 
Sometimes he’s suffering from depression 

196
00:16:49,847 --> 00:16:53,237
-But he’s very good with Brooker.
-What the hell is that?

197
00:16:54,487 --> 00:16:56,876
It’s our flagship. 
Our best seller.

198
00:16:57,287 --> 00:16:58,879
That’s what got us started.

199
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:04,280
The hero doesn’t like 
crying, shouting, or hitting.

200
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:09,484
My private space was violated.

201
00:17:11,047 --> 00:17:14,437
I’ll insist on gaining control. 
They have to respect me.

202
00:17:15,847 --> 00:17:19,044
The Six Managers
can become a pain.

203
00:17:19,847 --> 00:17:22,236
They’re the creative team 
of our company.

204
00:17:23,047 --> 00:17:27,438
I’ve no idea from actor’s psychology
but it must be the same thing more or less. 

205
00:17:28,487 --> 00:17:30,876
So things are really that bad?

206
00:17:32,647 --> 00:17:36,640
I love them a lot although 
they can be really hard to deal with. 

207
00:17:37,487 --> 00:17:40,081
It’s not that bad as in Slagelsi in 1992.

208
00:17:40,647 --> 00:17:43,844
I had to speak to the women 
in the audience after the show. 

209
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:49,438
I had no idea they knew
 their theatre in Slagelsi.

210
00:17:56,487 --> 00:18:00,480
-What’s Wrong?
-It’s my distant look.

211
00:18:02,287 --> 00:18:05,085
-It must be scary.
-Yes it’s effective.

212
00:18:06,287 --> 00:18:09,085
The Six are far more hostile 
than what expected.

213
00:18:10,487 --> 00:18:13,285
Tech meeting sounds like trouble. 

214
00:18:13,487 --> 00:18:17,480
Tell me what you do, so I can have an idea.

215
00:18:18,647 --> 00:18:19,636
 IT .

216
00:18:21,647 --> 00:18:25,640
I cant understand those stuff!
No way!

217
00:18:28,047 --> 00:18:30,845
Thank god you’re 
such a good actor then.

218
00:18:32,487 --> 00:18:35,877
Now you’re ready.
Take control.

219
00:18:37,647 --> 00:18:38,841
O?k 

220
00:18:56,487 --> 00:19:00,480
It’s quite a shock when the
copying machine starts working.

221
00:19:01,847 --> 00:19:05,635
Luckily it doesn’t happen often.
Only 1 .000 ötimes per day.

222
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:18,641
How’s the weather in the country today?

223
00:19:23,047 --> 00:19:24,639
Lets suppose...

224
00:19:25,647 --> 00:19:29,640
...it’s wintry like all over the land.

225
00:19:34,487 --> 00:19:36,284
Are you looking for your office?

226
00:19:38,647 --> 00:19:42,845
It’ll be safer here than walking around.

227
00:19:44,047 --> 00:19:45,844
Safe?
What do you mean?

228
00:19:46,847 --> 00:19:51,238
To find me, since I visit so rarely.

229
00:19:52,287 --> 00:19:56,485
You want to see them?  I told them to wait.
I’ll let them know. 

230
00:19:57,287 --> 00:20:01,280
-Thanks.
- Jokumsen is waiting outside.

231
00:20:01,847 --> 00:20:04,236
I don’t know how he found out you’re here.

232
00:20:04,847 --> 00:20:08,237
He has filed a complained since a long time.

233
00:20:08,847 --> 00:20:11,839
I’m not sure if anyone ever spoke 
with him after that. 

234
00:20:14,287 --> 00:20:17,484
Should we schedule him after the meeting? 

235
00:20:24,047 --> 00:20:28,643
Sorry. It had the boss’ role when you were not here. 

236
00:20:30,487 --> 00:20:32,876
Lets start with the directors vision. 

237
00:20:33,487 --> 00:20:36,684
I would like to hear more 
about our goals.

238
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:39,876
I studied the philosophy of the company.

239
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:46,277
Some strategic and technical measures
 are not clear..

240
00:20:55,847 --> 00:21:00,637
Transactions hierarchy. Why not?
Rule 8020: direct development.

241
00:21:02,287 --> 00:21:05,677
It’s just a small part of necessary conditions.

242
00:21:06,287 --> 00:21:09,085
...to provide IT support
on an adequate level .

243
00:21:09,487 --> 00:21:12,684
Apart form these fucking terms...

244
00:21:13,287 --> 00:21:15,676
...how does the boss determine 
the hierarchy of the transactions? 

245
00:21:17,647 --> 00:21:21,435
And rule 8020? I may have missed
something, but what it is exactly?  

246
00:21:21,847 --> 00:21:26,637
”Direct development” 
can be defined in 7 or 8 ways .

247
00:21:27,287 --> 00:21:28,879
How do you define it?

248
Define... I’m tempted to say “dictate”.

249
00:21:50,647 --> 00:21:55,437
There’s a tenuous difference 
between the two.

250
00:21:59,847 --> 00:22:04,238
And it all ends on the boss’ will to dictate.  

251
00:22:05,287 --> 00:22:08,484
Or the boss’s knowledge of what this company is about. 

252
00:22:10,487 --> 00:22:13,479
-Of course I do.
-What is it then?

253
00:22:14,287 --> 00:22:16,482
-What 
-What do we do in this company then?

254
00:22:18,647 --> 00:22:21,241
Haven’t you prepared a presentation?
What do we do?

255
00:22:24,487 --> 00:22:27,479
-This and that. Stuff..
-Like? 

256
00:22:31,847 --> 00:22:35,442
Hi there.
I have an announcement to make.

257
00:22:37,847 --> 00:22:40,645
Nalle, why the long face?
Come on...

258
00:22:41,287 --> 00:22:43,084
Smile a little...

259
00:22:47,047 --> 00:22:48,639
And a little hug...

260
00:22:49,487 --> 00:22:52,684
What is the nature of your announcement Ravn? 

261
00:22:56,647 --> 00:23:00,435
Our trip to Kullen is cancelled.

262
00:23:04,647 --> 00:23:07,844
We were to go since we didn’t go last year. 

263
00:23:16,047 --> 00:23:18,436
-Quiet Spencer.
-Make it so we can go.

264
00:23:19,047 --> 00:23:22,244
I’m afraid the order comes from high above.

265
00:23:22,647 --> 00:23:27,243
I know it shows a 
strict attitude against staff 

266
00:23:28,487 --> 00:23:32,685
I’m sure there must be a reason.

267
00:23:33,487 --> 00:23:35,876
We don’t go because the Boss of it All said no. 

268
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:40,640
“The Boss of it All said no”.
What’s new?  

269
00:23:41,487 --> 00:23:45,480
Why don’t we pick up and just go? 

270
00:23:46,047 --> 00:23:50,040
-Be good Gorm.
-You’re not good with us.

271
00:23:50,647 --> 00:23:55,243
We all agree we would be better off without the boss. 

272
00:23:55,847 --> 00:23:59,840
Let’s not spoil the good atmosphere.
It’s my fault. 

273
00:24:01,487 --> 00:24:05,082
The point is not if the boss is strict or not. 

274
00:24:05,647 --> 00:24:08,241
Let’s here what Svend has to say. 

275
00:24:12,487 --> 00:24:14,284
Svend?
C’mon Svend. 

276
00:24:27,847 --> 00:24:32,841
We study sales reports. Usually not 
at tech meetings though. 

277
00:24:33,287 --> 00:24:36,279
Can you tell us if you saw the sales reports? 

278
00:24:36,847 --> 00:24:40,840
-Of course I did.
-And what do you think?

279
00:24:45,487 --> 00:24:47,079
They’re shit. 

280
00:24:54,047 --> 00:24:56,641
Finally it’s out in the open.
They’re shit..

281
00:24:58,287 --> 00:24:59,879
They’re crap.

282
00:25:00,487 --> 00:25:02,079
Turds and feces.

283
00:25:02,647 --> 00:25:05,639
We should change the course of this ship. 

284
00:25:06,287 --> 00:25:08,676
These numbers should better improve.

285
00:25:08,847 --> 00:25:12,635
-Finally it’s out in the open...
-Come on Mette…

286
00:25:13,487 --> 00:25:16,081
The numbers look fine on your e-mails.

287
00:25:16,487 --> 00:25:18,876
Did Mette say they’re good?

288
00:25:19,047 --> 00:25:22,244
All that I can say mette...

289
00:25:23,047 --> 00:25:25,641
...is that they’re not good enough.

290
00:25:26,047 --> 00:25:28,038
They’re very far from good. 

291
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:37,236
-Mette is crying again.
-Relax Mette

292
00:25:38,287 --> 00:25:39,879
They’re only numbers.

293
00:25:48,287 --> 00:25:52,883
They’re Outside. You want to see Lise and Spencer 
or  Jokumsen 

294
00:25:53,487 --> 00:25:56,285
Everybody, apart from Jokumsen. 
His complaint is just.  .

295
00:26:00,487 --> 00:26:05,083
-Lise is our HR representative. 
- Of course why not? 

296
00:26:05,487 --> 00:26:07,876
Spencer has something to say...

297
00:26:08,647 --> 00:26:11,036
-No more.
-No more...

298
00:26:13,047 --> 00:26:15,242
We won’t tolerate no more...

299
00:26:17,287 --> 00:26:21,280
-These ...
-Working Conditions.

300
00:26:23,047 --> 00:26:26,244
It’s easier for me to say it since you can’t.

301
00:26:27,287 --> 00:26:29,482
He means “working conditions”.

302
00:26:29,647 --> 00:26:33,435
Our working conditions are terrible
 as well as policy.

303
00:26:33,847 --> 00:26:38,637
Other companies have perks, bonuses. 
Here’s a list.

304
00:26:39,847 --> 00:26:42,042
Would you mind going Heidi?

305
00:26:44,047 --> 00:26:45,241
Out of the office.

306
00:26:46,287 --> 00:26:50,883
So you relate to other companies as well?

307
00:26:51,847 --> 00:26:54,236
I would be naive to believe...

308
00:26:55,487 --> 00:26:58,479
...that the market is made
 from small businesses only.

309
00:26:59,047 --> 00:27:02,244
With “Hell’s Rangers” on your shoulder...

310
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:05,484
...your needs demand special care.

311
00:27:05,847 --> 00:27:07,644
But you don’t have to talk about that..

312
00:27:13,847 --> 00:27:15,041
HR...

313
00:27:17,487 --> 00:27:20,684
Human Resources. 
You’ve been away so long..

314
00:27:20,847 --> 00:27:24,840
...you can’t remember the meaning of it.
I’ll check the translation in english.

315
00:27:26,847 --> 00:27:28,439
You can tell me. 

316
00:27:31,847 --> 00:27:33,644
You can spit it all out.

317
00:27:34,647 --> 00:27:39,243
I talked it over with the others
You’ re not reliable.

318
00:27:43,287 --> 00:27:45,676
Your personality betrays you. 

319
00:27:46,287 --> 00:27:49,085
You’ re not the one you pretend to be. 

320
00:27:52,047 --> 00:27:54,436
I think you should say the truth.

321
00:27:57,647 --> 00:28:02,243
You believe it’s the right move at this point? 

322
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:04,838
You really believe that?

323
00:28:06,847 --> 00:28:10,044
It wouldn’t make a difference.
It’s obvious.

324
00:28:10,847 --> 00:28:13,645
Your lines show no reliability. 

325
00:28:14,287 --> 00:28:16,881
You’re a bad actor from beginning to end. 

326
00:28:20,487 --> 00:28:25,277
“My lines show no reliability”

327
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,676
You’re overdoing it. 
You called me “a bad actor”

328
00:28:28,847 --> 00:28:31,645
Then the audience is convulsed.

329
00:28:32,047 --> 00:28:35,437
They don’t understand 
that the point in comedy today...

330
00:28:35,847 --> 00:28:38,236
...it’s the revelation of it.

331
00:28:38,847 --> 00:28:42,442
Destruction stroke.
We’re close to the end.

332
00:28:43,047 --> 00:28:47,040
People today want everything 
to be reliable and normal.

333
00:28:47,287 --> 00:28:49,676
Well things are not really like that, now!

334
00:28:51,287 --> 00:28:53,278
-Yoy have a reliability problem
-I don’t.

335
00:28:53,487 --> 00:28:55,079
-You do
-I don’t

336
00:28:55,487 --> 00:28:59,275
I don’t know a lot about you,
but I know what you’re not. 

337
00:29:02,287 --> 00:29:04,482
So tell me what I’m not damn it!

338
00:29:05,847 --> 00:29:07,041
A faggot.

339
00:29:09,847 --> 00:29:12,042
-A faggot?
-Yew faggot.

340
00:29:12,847 --> 00:29:16,237
It’s not as much that you’re trying 
to convince me that you’re a fag

341
00:29:16,647 --> 00:29:20,242
...as that you’re pretending you 
don’t remember what IT means.. 

342
00:29:20,487 --> 00:29:23,877
...or, management or HR.

343
00:29:24,487 --> 00:29:26,796
“Hell’s Rangers”!
Come on now!

344
00:29:26,847 --> 00:29:30,442
Of course you’re an expert.
How else you would have managed?

345
00:29:31,487 --> 00:29:33,284
-I’m I right? 
-Yes.

346
00:29:35,047 --> 00:29:38,437
Why would you believe 
that I’m a fag?

347
00:29:39,487 --> 00:29:43,275
You were sending me e-mails
To drive me apart.

348
00:29:43,647 --> 00:29:47,845
-Ravn made me realize it.
-What would I win that way?

349
00:29:48,047 --> 00:29:52,837
The same thing you win by acting 
Stupid in you business. 

350
00:29:54,287 --> 00:29:57,484
To look interesting or 
to make us feel pitty for you. 

351
00:29:59,487 --> 00:30:02,684
You got that last thing right.

352
00:30:05,287 --> 00:30:08,882
You pretended you didn’t know what IT is.

353
00:30:09,487 --> 00:30:12,285
I admit that was a bit far fetched. 

354
00:30:13,487 --> 00:30:17,480
-But I am a fag.
-You don’t look like one.

355
00:30:17,647 --> 00:30:22,243
Some of us are this way.
I’m not trying to convince you.

356
00:30:23,047 --> 00:30:25,242
I’m sorry about that

357
00:30:26,287 --> 00:30:29,085
I’m a fag since the day I was born. 

358
00:30:29,487 --> 00:30:31,478
You cant explain something like that.

359
00:30:32,047 --> 00:30:35,244
Better to be a fag than to be unlaoved.

360
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:42,642
I can tell you why you like men.

361
00:30:45,647 --> 00:30:48,445
You haven’t met the right woman yet. 

362
00:30:59,487 --> 00:31:01,682
On neutral ground. 
Now!

363
00:31:07,647 --> 00:31:11,242
I’m tired of walking in the dark. 
I have no control over things.

364
00:31:12,487 --> 00:31:17,277
It would have been much easier if I knew 
What I said or wrote in the past. 

365
00:31:19,047 --> 00:31:21,436
Faggot?
You could have told me!

366
00:31:22,287 --> 00:31:24,881
-Damn it Ravn
-You’re right

367
00:31:25,487 --> 00:31:28,081
Only Lise’s president is a fag.

368
00:31:29,287 --> 00:31:31,676
You’ve told each other different stuff? 

369
00:31:35,487 --> 00:31:37,284
I know...

370
00:31:38,047 --> 00:31:41,642
-You told them different things? 
-I understood the question.

371
00:31:43,047 --> 00:31:45,038
Are you completely stupid? 

372
00:31:50,847 --> 00:31:53,839
I was creating positive energy.

373
00:31:55,047 --> 00:31:58,437
Everybody feels you close to them.
That’s what I mean

374
00:31:59,847 --> 00:32:04,637
-And the IT thing? I really can’t get what it is.
-Me neither

375
00:32:05,287 --> 00:32:08,085
-You’re doing great.
-You really thing so?

376
00:32:08,847 --> 00:32:11,236
Keep it up for a few more days.

377
00:32:11,847 --> 00:32:15,442
Listen to my advise. 
Don’t take it so seriously. 

378
00:32:17,487 --> 00:32:20,479
All those stuff about taking control, are ok…

379
00:32:22,287 --> 00:32:24,881
...but it would be easier if you didn’t try.

380
00:32:25,047 --> 00:32:28,437
Let the audience do the hard work.
You wont stress yourself that way. 

381
00:32:30,047 --> 00:32:33,437
Say “yes”. When they come to you,
Say “yes”

382
00:32:33,647 --> 00:32:37,242
It may not be that artistic but it works.

383
00:32:37,847 --> 00:32:41,635
Say “yes”? That’ improvisational theatre. 

384
00:32:42,047 --> 00:32:45,244
Just like when some jerk wants 
to put on a dress… 

385
00:32:46,287 --> 00:32:49,882
...and we all have to cheer.

386
00:32:51,647 --> 00:32:54,036
Gambini didn’t believe in that.

387
00:32:54,287 --> 00:32:58,485
For him improvisation was a bow to drama. 

388
00:32:59,287 --> 00:33:03,678
He was the first to understand Ibsen.
Ibsen was an idiot.

389
00:33:04,487 --> 00:33:07,684
Incapable to grab disaster by the throat.

390
00:33:08,647 --> 00:33:11,445
Why don’t you go straight to soap operas?

391
00:33:11,647 --> 00:33:16,243
With their sentimentality and all the fucking cliches? 

392
00:33:16,647 --> 00:33:19,639
“It’s au revoir, not goodbye” and bullshit like these. 

393
00:33:19,847 --> 00:33:22,042
-these are bullshit
-definitely.

394
00:33:25,847 --> 00:33:27,041
Relax.

395
00:33:28,647 --> 00:33:33,243
Sorry. You should know. 
Its your role. Your idea.

396
00:33:34,287 --> 00:33:37,085
And ideas are god. 
Even Hitler’s ideas

397
00:33:37,847 --> 00:33:41,044
If you want improvisation 
and acting you got it.

398
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:45,485
I’ll say yes till you’re sick of it.

399
00:33:47,647 --> 00:33:49,603
But not to Jokumsen.

400
00:33:49,647 --> 00:33:52,639
He has a just complaint for six years now..

401
00:33:53,487 --> 00:33:55,876
Why didn’t he came six years ago?

402
00:33:56,647 --> 00:33:59,639
He did, but the Boss of it all 
Was away that day

403
00:34:02,647 --> 00:34:06,037
-Ok
-And what about the IT terminology? 

404
00:34:06,647 --> 00:34:09,241
When they say “exhaust our resources” 
they mean “outsourcing”.

405
00:34:12,647 --> 00:34:13,841
Easy as a pie. 

406
00:34:20,847 --> 00:34:23,236
The results of our structural unit...

407
00:34:23,287 --> 00:34:25,676
...are better than what we expected.

408
00:34:26,047 --> 00:34:29,244
We have to slow down the process. 

409
00:34:29,487 --> 00:34:32,285
We have to add more authentications.

410
00:34:32,647 --> 00:34:36,640
Exhausting are resources seems like a great idea...

411
00:34:36,847 --> 00:34:37,836
Excuse me...

412
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:42,482
You mean outsourcing...

413
00:34:46,647 --> 00:34:49,639
You said exaust our resources 
but you meant outsourcing.

414
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:53,436
Of cource.
Thank you Svend

415
00:34:57,847 --> 00:35:02,045
So what does the boss say?
Do we have thegreen light?

416
00:35:03,047 --> 00:35:06,437
-Yes or no?
-I can answer that.

417
00:35:07,847 --> 00:35:11,044
We all do. “If it’s cheaper by 1/3 we go ahead”.

418
00:35:12,847 --> 00:35:14,439
Is Nalle right? 

419
00:35:18,847 --> 00:35:21,236
The Boss of it all spoke. 

420
00:35:21,847 --> 00:35:24,645
You had to sabotage Nalle.

421
00:35:26,487 --> 00:35:30,275
Disgrace him in front of everybody
You’re a bastard

422
00:35:32,487 --> 00:35:33,681
I am.

423
00:35:38,287 --> 00:35:41,279
Lets get up.
And a big hug

424
00So sweet. Like a baby. 
But no, babies mean reproduction.. 

425
00:35:46,487 --> 00:35:49,684
...and that requires fucking people 
of the opposite sex. .

426
00:35:58,047 --> 00:36:01,244
If you have a question 
or want to ask something…

427
00:36:02,287 --> 00:36:06,280
...then the answer may be “yes” .

428
00:36:08,287 --> 00:36:11,484
May I say something?
Me or anyone else?

429
00:36:13,487 --> 00:36:15,079
They can say “yes”...

430
00:36:18,047 --> 00:36:20,038
...or yes, or yes, or yes.

431
00:36:27,487 --> 00:36:31,480
-That’s enough Svend. Got it?
-Yes.

432
00:36:31,647 --> 00:36:34,844
You’d better! 
Enough with your faggoty shit.

433
00:36:35,047 --> 00:36:37,436
I know when somebody likes me. 

434
00:36:39,647 --> 00:36:42,844
-You are a big tease.
-Yes.

435
00:36:45,047 --> 00:36:49,837
Those e-mails... “Be good with Ravn, take care of him”

436
00:36:50,847 --> 00:36:53,236
-was to make me fall for you..
-Yes

437
00:36:54,647 --> 00:36:58,845
Fun is nice but there are 
bigger fishes to fry. 

438
00:37:00,287 --> 00:37:02,676
-I don’t care.
-Yes.

439
00:37:04,047 --> 00:37:07,437
-As long as you’re in control?
-Yes

440
00:37:10,647 --> 00:37:13,639
Here and now. 
The sooner the better.

441
00:37:16,287 --> 00:37:17,879
Chauvinist pig. 

442
00:37:20,487 --> 00:37:24,480
You won’t fuck me till 
I blow you good first.

443
00:37:36,487 --> 00:37:39,479
An now on the desk..
That s how things are.

444
00:37:39,847 --> 00:37:41,644
-Yes
-Right?

445
00:37:45,647 --> 00:37:48,445
You like it better 
when I’m like that?.

446
00:37:58,287 --> 00:38:00,881
Don’t get confused there are two holes..

447
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:04,644
-Yes
-Right.

448
00:38:09,647 --> 00:38:12,639
That’s why the call you 
big boss then.

449
00:38:16,847 --> 00:38:18,644
You’re a bastard.

450
00:38:23,287 --> 00:38:25,482
Is that all you can say?

451
00:38:28,647 --> 00:38:30,444
You know Gambini? 

452
00:38:33,047 --> 00:38:34,241
Who? 

453
00:38:44,487 --> 00:38:46,284
You look tired.

454
00:38:47,847 --> 00:38:51,442
I told Yokumsen that 
he couldn’t see you today

455
00:38:51,647 --> 00:38:54,445
I told him to try again next week.
Is that okay.

456
00:38:55,647 --> 00:39:00,243
-of course because I wont be here then.
-You’re leaving again?

457
00:39:04,847 --> 00:39:07,805
Thanks from the letters from all over the world.

458
00:39:07,847 --> 00:39:09,838
They meant a lot to me.

459
00:39:13,047 --> 00:39:14,844
And I answered all of them.

460
00:39:15,847 --> 00:39:17,439
Except from one. 

461
00:39:21,487 --> 00:39:22,886
Yes right.

462
00:39:24,647 --> 00:39:27,445
There was one you didn’t answer.

463
00:39:28,487 --> 00:39:30,079
Why didn’t you?

464
00:39:31,287 --> 00:39:34,484
-You want to talk about it now?
-I’m here aren’t i?

465
00:39:38,647 --> 00:39:40,239
That’s true.

466
00:39:40,847 --> 00:39:43,441
You always joke about stuff

467
00:39:44,647 --> 00:39:49,437
Sometimes I get confused.
I don’t know if you’re joking

468
00:39:51,647 --> 00:39:54,036
Why you believe I was joking. 

469
00:39:56,047 --> 00:39:58,038
I couldn’t have been something else.

470
00:39:59,847 --> 00:40:02,839
If it wasn t a joke what would you tell me.

471
00:40:07,287 --> 00:40:09,278
I think you know.

472
00:40:10,487 --> 00:40:12,876
No I don’t. 
That’s why I ask

473
00:40:13,847 --> 00:40:16,236
-if it wasn’t a joke?
-Yes.

474
00:40:18,647 --> 00:40:20,239
I’d say “yes”

475
00:40:21,487 --> 00:40:24,684
It’s absurd. 
We don’t know each other at all.

476
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,645
You don’t seem very thrilled with my “yes”.

477
00:40:38,487 --> 00:40:41,081
Sorry. Its stupid of me.

478
00:40:42,047 --> 00:40:43,639
I’m ashamed.

479
00:40:45,647 --> 00:40:47,239
That’s why I didn’t wrote back.

480
00:40:49,287 --> 00:40:51,278
Naturally ... it was a joke.

481
00:40:52,487 --> 00:40:54,079
Yes and a funny one. 

482
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:58,085
I’m so stupid.
I thought it was for real.

483
00:40:58,647 --> 00:41:00,638
Sorry. I’m blushing

484
00:41:02,287 --> 00:41:03,879
I think that...

485
00:41:07,487 --> 00:41:10,877
...the fact that you would say “yes” its perfect. .

486
00:41:12,047 --> 00:41:16,040
Not many people would.
I respect you for that

487
00:41:16,647 --> 00:41:17,841
Perfect…

488
00:41:20,047 --> 00:41:22,436
Can we forget about it now/

489
00:41:23,847 --> 00:41:27,840
I cant believe that I was so vague
that you were doubting me.

490
00:41:28,647 --> 00:41:31,445
I don’t do those things. 
Its not my character. 

491
00:41:31,847 --> 00:41:34,441
Sometimes we ask just for fun..

492
00:41:34,847 --> 00:41:37,645
...in case that one day we’ll have to ask for real..

493
00:41:40,647 --> 00:41:43,445
I thought there was real romance here.

494
00:41:44,047 --> 00:41:45,241
Come now!

495
00:41:47,487 --> 00:41:50,877
You think that I’m hiding my intentions...

496
00:41:51,647 --> 00:41:54,844
...and fishing for answers out of fear?

497
00:41:55,287 --> 00:41:59,485
You think the big boss would do something like that?

498
00:41:59,847 --> 00:42:02,042
A man is a man, a word is a word...

499
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:04,482
...and a boss is a boss.

500
00:42:04,647 --> 00:42:07,639
I didn’t built an empire by running away..

501
00:42:08,047 --> 00:42:10,845
Heidi A.! I remember this e-mail clearly. 

502
00:42:11,647 --> 00:42:14,844
You ask me if I meant it 
and the answer is “yes” 

503
00:42:15,847 --> 00:42:18,236
And the question still stands.

504
00:42:20,647 --> 00:42:22,239
Gasping is right.

505
00:42:22,487 --> 00:42:25,684
-I’m happy.
-If you’re happy, I’m happy too.

506
00:42:26,287 --> 00:42:29,085
You didn’t do it for stopping from resigning?

507
00:42:31,647 --> 00:42:34,036
Of course not. What does it have to do with this?

508
00:42:34,287 --> 00:42:38,075
And I didn’t resign. I stayed with you. 

509
00:42:39,647 --> 00:42:43,845
-That’s what you did.
-Because of your e-mail

510
00:42:48,047 --> 00:42:51,244
It’s time for the boss to go home.

511
00:42:52,647 --> 00:42:57,243
I’m glad we resolved this matter happily.

512
00:43:01,047 --> 00:43:03,436
You seem as if something is bothering you.

513
00:43:08,287 --> 00:43:11,085
-Everything will be alright.
-I’m glad you meant it.

514
00:43:13,287 --> 00:43:16,279
Especially since you know so little about me.

515
00:43:17,487 --> 00:43:20,081
Isn’t something you would like to know?

516
00:43:21,487 --> 00:43:24,081
Of course there is Heidi A.

517
00:43:26,847 --> 00:43:30,442
What does the “A” stands for?
Not that it matters.

518
00:43:30,647 --> 00:43:33,445
Because now it will become Heidi E. 

519
00:43:36,047 --> 00:43:37,844
Heide Ekersberg

520
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:43,879
Okay then...

521
00:43:51,647 --> 00:43:55,435
No! When everything was going fine.
An intermission. Why?

522
00:43:55,847 --> 00:43:59,044
And don’t get me started 
on that vulgar, awkward zoom

523
00:43:59,847 --> 00:44:03,237
Here’s a statement. 
There is no comedy without an intermission. 

524
00:44:03,487 --> 00:44:06,877
We have to supply vitamins,
even if we are reluctant.

525
00:44:07,287 --> 00:44:10,085
Who wants to be the doctor who with 
A syringe at hand....

526
00:44:10,287 --> 00:44:12,676
...will disrupt a childs play?

527
00:44:12,847 --> 00:44:14,439
Well, that would be me. 

528
00:44:15,287 --> 00:44:20,077
I feel obliged to introduce a new hero. 

529
00:44:31,047 --> 00:44:33,038
The boss is horny.

530
00:44:33,847 --> 00:44:37,237
There might still exist a bit of ...

531
00:44:38,847 --> 00:44:41,042
...homosexuality
On this dick.

532
00:44:41,847 --> 00:44:44,645
The boss will be right there.

533
00:44:47,647 --> 00:44:50,639
How are the returns today honey?

534
00:44:51,047 --> 00:44:52,844
Not bad at all honey.

535
00:44:53,847 --> 00:44:58,045
-You don’t work for this company
-Neither do you. 

536
00:45:00,047 --> 00:45:02,436
I don’t remember ever seeing you
That happy..

537
00:45:02,847 --> 00:45:06,044
But we’ve only been married 5 years.
Or was it 50?

538
00:45:07,847 --> 00:45:12,637
Were you ever happy?
Only when you spoke about Gambini.

539
00:45:13,487 --> 00:45:18,083
This phony that no one has ever heard of. 

540
00:45:18,487 --> 00:45:20,876
A phony wouldn’t stage plays 
in seven big theaters.  

541
00:45:21,487 --> 00:45:23,682
With a Gambini play,
 fiasco is unavoidable. 

542
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:26,042
Who have heard of an one act play
That lasts 3 hours?

543
00:45:26,287 --> 00:45:28,676
The Chimney Sweepers Monologue.

544
00:45:30,047 --> 00:45:34,040
Too Christmassy for my taste.

545
00:45:35,287 --> 00:45:38,279
-That’s why I couldn’t stand you.
-I couldn’t stand you either.

546
00:45:41,847 --> 00:45:44,441
-Why not?
-Peanuts.

547
00:45:46,287 --> 00:45:50,485
Yu ate them with the husk 
I’ve only seen such a thing in cartoons. 

548
00:45:51,047 --> 00:45:55,837
It used to drive me crazy. 
I bet you want something from me. 

549
00:45:57,647 --> 00:46:00,844
-You came to win me back?
-I don’t want you back

550
00:46:01,647 --> 00:46:05,435
You came for something else then.
You’re very lively. 

551
00:46:07,487 --> 00:46:12,277
You must have got a promotion. 

552
00:46:12,647 --> 00:46:15,445
I’m Finnur Sigurdson’s lawyer. 

553
00:46:17,287 --> 00:46:18,879
Capitalism!

554
00:46:19,487 --> 00:46:22,684
Weren’t you supposed to use your degree
 to fight guys like him?

555
00:46:23,647 --> 00:46:26,605
Yeah that was the plan. 

556
00:46:26,647 --> 00:46:29,036
Finnur mentioned me,
You didn’t notice.

557
00:46:29,487 --> 00:46:31,079
Life is like a Dogma film.

558
00:46:31,287 --> 00:46:34,484
It’s hard to hear what they say,
But the words remain important. 

559
00:46:35,287 --> 00:46:39,883
I don’t think that the president 
will be present tomorrow…

560
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,436
... to meet with my client.  

561
00:46:43,287 --> 00:46:47,075
I had my doubts, but I know
Yoy’re not the president. 

562
00:46:47,647 --> 00:46:50,844
Couldn’t I be the big boss?

563
00:46:51,047 --> 00:46:55,006
Like the chimney sweeper 
in a town without chimneys.

564
00:46:55,047 --> 00:46:59,438
-Always with ashes on the forehead.
-you could be wrong.

565
00:47:01,647 --> 00:47:04,844
I have much more inside me 
That what you’ve ever saw.

566
00:47:10,287 --> 00:47:13,484
-But you haven’t have you?
-No

567
00:47:16,287 --> 00:47:19,677
Not according to what 
they teach you in law school.

568
00:47:20,047 --> 00:47:23,244
What we learn there 
were more tangible.

569
00:47:23,487 --> 00:47:25,876
So are you the real president
or not.

570
00:47:26,287 --> 00:47:28,676
Okay, I’m just an impersonator.

571
00:47:29,287 --> 00:47:32,279
But I can’t talk. I signed a cotract
not to reveal anything.

572
00:47:33,487 --> 00:47:35,478
With Ravn?

573
00:47:40,487 --> 00:47:44,480
He has were he wants you.
He’s an expert on contracts. 

574
00:47:46,487 --> 00:47:48,079
Would you tell on me?

575
00:47:49,647 --> 00:47:54,038
I would ten years ago, when you
 were just staring as an actor

576
00:47:57,487 --> 00:48:00,479
-But I see you like the part.
-I’m good at it.

577
00:48:00,647 --> 00:48:04,640
That’s what it looks like. 
And you don’t have the luxury to deny a role..

578
00:48:06,487 --> 00:48:09,684
It’s against your beliefs to control things

579
00:48:10,287 --> 00:48:13,882
-You only want some attention.
-I control the company.

580
00:48:14,287 --> 00:48:18,678
So the real owner can do his job.

581
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:23,241
As the lawyers say “acquitted
due to stupidity”.

582
00:48:23,847 --> 00:48:26,236
And you are stupid if you believe Ravn

583
00:48:26,487 --> 00:48:29,081
Ravn is okay. 
We go along fine.

584
00:48:29,487 --> 00:48:33,480
He likes the job but 
hasn’t got the will to be the boss

585
00:48:34,287 --> 00:48:36,676
He’s a pussy but he’s not meen.

586
00:48:36,847 --> 00:48:41,637
He abuses the system to work 
everybody to the bone. 

587
00:48:42,287 --> 00:48:47,077
By blaming someone else 
you get to be the nice guy.

588
00:48:48,647 --> 00:48:52,242
-And what’s it to you?
-Nothing

589
00:48:55,047 --> 00:48:58,244
But I saw a spark of dignity in you.

590
00:48:59,047 --> 00:49:01,845
You’re not as bad as youwould like Kristoffer.

591
00:49:03,047 --> 00:49:07,040
For a moment I thought that 
you considered the moral aspects.

592
00:49:07,647 --> 00:49:11,845
Ravn’s deals are good for the company
And the people.

593
00:49:12,647 --> 00:49:17,437
This is a good opportunity for his work.

594
00:49:18,047 --> 00:49:20,845
So since you like Ravn so much...

595
00:49:21,847 --> 00:49:25,840
...i guess that he has informed his people...

596
00:49:26,847 --> 00:49:30,044
...that their jobs is the subject 
of tomorrows meeting.

597
00:49:33,287 --> 00:49:38,077
-Ravn is selling the company?
-Yes. It’s that simple. 

598
00:49:47,847 --> 00:49:51,442
You didn’t do it .
You didn’t manipulated me.

599
00:49:52,847 --> 00:49:54,838
You were a gentleman.

600
00:49:56,647 --> 00:50:01,437
Even when I left the company 
For a competitor.

601
00:50:03,287 --> 00:50:06,279
You put pressure o Ravn a few times..

602
00:50:07,047 --> 00:50:10,039
He was really sad 
after one of your phonecalls.

603
00:50:12,847 --> 00:50:15,236
I’ve got to go downstairs…

604
00:50:16,647 --> 00:50:18,842
...to make some photocopies.

605
00:50:19,047 --> 00:50:21,436
Do you feel that somebody else
Has been manipulated?

606
00:50:22,047 --> 00:50:24,436
Not me, but Gorm does. 

607
00:50:26,047 --> 00:50:27,844
It was a big hit for him.

608
00:50:29,047 --> 00:50:33,040
The fact that you didn’t had him work
on the Brooker platform.

609
00:50:33,847 --> 00:50:36,441
He was working for to years on the other platform..

610
00:50:37,487 --> 00:50:42,083
How can you talk about brooker?
It’s ours. 

611
00:50:44,287 --> 00:50:47,484
It’s not me who talks but Nalle. 
You weren’t fair.

612
00:50:47,847 --> 00:50:50,236
You told him he was unprepaired...

613
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:54,044
...you knew he wouldn’t take it nicely

614
00:50:57,847 --> 00:51:00,236
Can I ask you a question in English 

615
00:51:00,487 --> 00:51:01,681
Danish...

616
00:51:01,847 --> 00:51:03,041
No, danish.

617
00:51:06,287 --> 00:51:08,084
You stopped his Danish lessons...

618
00:51:08,287 --> 00:51:10,482
...so he couldn’t chit chat around.

619
00:51:10,847 --> 00:51:14,840
-he could do it in English 
-yes but he didn’t wanted to. 

620
00:51:16,647 --> 00:51:20,435
And me... You had me answer to Ravn. 

621
00:51:20,647 --> 00:51:23,036
But it dint do you any good..

622
00:51:25,487 --> 00:51:28,081
-And Ravn?
-Our sweet teddy bear?

623
00:51:30,287 --> 00:51:34,280
You cant but love him, even though he’s pathetic.

624
00:51:35,647 --> 00:51:40,038
I shouldn’t mention his economic state..

625
00:51:43,047 --> 00:51:46,437
-How do you Know?
-he told us.

626
00:51:46,847 --> 00:51:51,637
We decided to lend him 25.000 each.

627
00:51:51,847 --> 00:51:53,439
Not that it helped.

628
00:51:55,487 --> 00:51:58,684
-Why not?
-he hasn’t paid us back

629
00:52:01,647 --> 00:52:04,036
And then there’s poor Mette.

630
00:52:06,287 --> 00:52:09,279
You know what happened 
After you fire her husband.

631
00:52:10,487 --> 00:52:13,479
-No I don’t
-He hang himself

632
00:52:15,847 --> 00:52:19,635
With the printer’s cord.
He couldn’t stand not being a part of it. 

633
00:52:20,647 --> 00:52:22,842
He was begging to come back.

634
00:52:23,047 --> 00:52:26,244
Ravn told us about the letters he sent you. 

635
00:52:30,047 --> 00:52:32,436
There was no place for him really.

636
00:52:33,647 --> 00:52:35,239
That’s life I guess.

637
00:52:36,647 --> 00:52:40,640
-And now Mette is in that state.
-Where is she?

638
00:52:41,487 --> 00:52:43,876
At the photocopies room I guess.

639
00:52:45,487 --> 00:52:47,876
Elizabette, is the printer working?

640
00:52:52,047 --> 00:52:52,843
There you are?.

641
00:53:44,647 --> 00:53:49,243
All lies.
There’s rumors in every workplace.

642
00:53:50,287 --> 00:53:54,485
I deserve some credit 
for starting the company. 

643
00:53:55,487 --> 00:53:57,682
There 150.000 was not a part of it

644
00:53:58,647 --> 00:54:00,239
Of course they were.

645
00:54:01,487 --> 00:54:04,877
They all lent you money, 
and you started the company. 

646
00:54:10,647 --> 00:54:14,037
-You make it sound bad.
-You can say that again!

647
00:54:14,487 --> 00:54:16,876
I run the company, you’re the actor.

648
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:20,081
Ask your part if the pieces fit.

649
00:54:20,647 --> 00:54:23,445
I did it and I’m afraid they do.

650
00:54:25,487 --> 00:54:27,284
If I’m such an asshole...

651
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:31,237
...they better sell and get rid of me. .

652
00:54:33,047 --> 00:54:35,641
We’ll have to sign an authorization. 

653
00:54:37,047 --> 00:54:40,642
I’ll guarantee the lowest price 
so you’ll sell for less.

654
00:54:41,287 --> 00:54:44,484
Kristoffer shouldn’t sell for nothing.

655
00:54:49,047 --> 00:54:52,039
-Don’t I get a copy?
-If you insist...

656
00:54:53,047 --> 00:54:55,845
I’m no better or worse
 than anybody else

657
00:54:56,047 --> 00:54:58,641
-I’m not sure.
-I feel misunderstood.

658
00:54:59,287 --> 00:55:02,484
I give and give but what do I get back?

659
00:55:03,847 --> 00:55:05,041
Almost nothing.

660
00:55:06,487 --> 00:55:09,684
Not exactly peanuts.

661
00:55:11,647 --> 00:55:14,036
Strindberg was misunderstood too. 

662
00:55:14,847 --> 00:55:17,236
People talked behind his back 
all the time.

663
00:55:17,487 --> 00:55:20,684
They were saying he pushed 
his wife down the stairs.

664
00:55:20,847 --> 00:55:23,042
-And he didn’t?
-Of Course he did.

665
00:55:23,287 --> 00:55:26,085
But that doesn’t make him
a bad writer.  

666
00:55:41,847 --> 00:55:45,044
Here’s my account number.
You’ll find it usefull. 

667
00:55:48,047 --> 00:55:51,642
The Norwegians wont be carrying 
Money on them.

668
00:55:54,287 --> 00:55:56,676
It’s not an account number. It’s the price.

669
00:55:59,287 --> 00:56:01,881
It’s right for you.

670
00:56:05,047 --> 00:56:08,244
That’s the vale of your company sir.

671
00:56:10,047 --> 00:56:11,639
Should we sign?

672
00:56:15,647 --> 00:56:16,841
Here…

673
00:56:18,847 --> 00:56:20,838
I caution you...

674
00:56:21,287 --> 00:56:23,676
...in two points in the text.

675
00:56:27,287 --> 00:56:30,484
The ones that refer to the personnel. .

676
00:56:30,847 --> 00:56:33,441
Allright .
I trust you completely. 

677
00:56:36,287 --> 00:56:38,482
The personnel will stay right?  

678
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:43,036
We didn’t agree that.

679
00:56:48,847 --> 00:56:52,635
We won’t inherit a bunch of fucking Danes.

680
00:56:54,047 --> 00:56:58,040
Mr Ravn is the only one that will stay.

681
00:57:03,047 --> 00:57:05,242
I also edited out some parts...

682
00:57:05,487 --> 00:57:10,277
...regarding selling the Brooker 5 
patent by mr Ravn

683
00:57:19,047 --> 00:57:21,436
What are the other stockholders getting?

684
00:57:25,287 --> 00:57:26,481
Nothing

685
00:57:28,487 --> 00:57:31,081
Mr Ravn has the exclusive rights.

686
00:57:37,647 --> 00:57:41,037
The Six believe they also have rights.

687
00:57:43,047 --> 00:57:46,437
Emotionally yes, by law no. 

688
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:51,044
They worked to make it 
but that was part of their job..

689
00:57:51,847 --> 00:57:53,644
Excuse me for a second.

690
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:58,236
Some fresh air is always good.

691
00:58:00,487 --> 00:58:04,480
It’s moving really, but
 you can’t really do anything.

692
00:58:05,287 --> 00:58:07,881
If I don’t sell to Finnur I’ll find someone else..

693
00:58:08,287 --> 00:58:11,085
You wont win by selling cheap.

694
00:58:12,287 --> 00:58:13,481
Come...

695
00:58:21,647 --> 00:58:24,445
-Mr President...
-Lets close the deal.

696
00:58:27,487 --> 00:58:29,284
It was about time.

697
00:58:34,287 --> 00:58:36,881
It’s sad to have to part it.

698
00:58:39,287 --> 00:58:43,280
But Ravn knows 
I’m a businessman at heart

699
00:58:48,847 --> 00:58:51,236
Lets talk business. 

700
00:58:57,287 --> 00:59:00,484
I had started to like this place.

701
00:59:08,647 --> 00:59:11,844
It was my stage for all these years.

702
00:59:12,647 --> 00:59:17,243
Nice thoughts but get it over with. 
We have to sign.

703
00:59:18,647 --> 00:59:21,241
Thanks Ravn. Always helpful.

704
00:59:21,487 --> 00:59:24,684
At your service. Sign here.

705
00:59:25,487 --> 00:59:28,285
I’ll take my finger 
so you can sign. 

706
00:59:30,287 --> 00:59:33,484
Wouldn’t you agree mr Finnur.
Mr Ravn always helps.

707
00:59:39,847 --> 00:59:43,044
I do not share your Danish sentimentality.

708
00:59:46,287 --> 00:59:48,676
All is left is my signature.

709
00:59:51,847 --> 00:59:55,044
Just one note for the person who 
drafted this contact.

710
00:59:56,047 --> 01:00:00,837
The numbering does not go 
in the middle of the page.

711
01:00:03,647 --> 01:00:07,845
I don’t know how you do things in Iceland.

712
01:00:09,847 --> 01:00:12,839
It’s not the page number, it’s the price.

713
01:00:22,287 --> 01:00:27,281
My copy says 245 million. 

714
01:00:38,647 --> 01:00:40,444
That’s what we agreed on.

715
01:00:42,287 --> 01:00:46,280
I can’t sell a life’s work at that price.
You understand.

716
01:00:53,487 --> 01:00:56,081
How much more 
would the president want?

717
01:01:00,047 --> 01:01:02,436
-More.
-How Much?

718
01:01:06,287 --> 01:01:07,481
50 cents

719
01:01:13,647 --> 01:01:16,036
It’s just a symbolic amount.

720
01:01:16,287 --> 01:01:19,484
As a businessman I need to feel
like I made a profit.

721
01:01:23,047 --> 01:01:27,040
We speak of free will, 
but we need the machine.

722
01:01:31,847 --> 01:01:34,042
The machine that wants gold..

723
01:01:47,847 --> 01:01:50,645
Sometimes just a crumb can fill you up.

724
01:01:54,047 --> 01:01:56,436
We’ll have to draft the contracts again..

725
01:01:57,487 --> 01:01:59,682
We can do it by hand..

726
01:02:07,847 --> 01:02:10,441
I know it’s a professional disagreement.

727
01:02:11,847 --> 01:02:14,645
But if I can get 
50 cents more…

728
01:02:16,487 --> 01:02:19,081
...i can get 50 million more as well.

729
01:02:23,047 --> 01:02:24,446
Mr Finnur?

730
01:02:27,047 --> 01:02:28,241
Finnur?

731
01:02:53,647 --> 01:02:54,841
There it is

732
01:02:56,847 --> 01:03:00,044
“The town Without Chimneys”
It was always here.

733
01:03:01,847 --> 01:03:04,441
All fit together at this moment...

734
01:03:04,647 --> 01:03:08,640
...to be blown apart 
by a Gambinian explosion.

735
01:03:16,047 --> 01:03:20,837
Unfortunately Gambini 
didn’t write our little comedy.

736
01:03:22,487 --> 01:03:27,277
His contempt would have made 
the genre unrecgnisable.

737
01:03:28,647 --> 01:03:31,639
No I adhere to to rules of the genre.

738
01:03:31,847 --> 01:03:34,645
As beautiful as may be 
the sight of two men...

739
01:03:35,047 --> 01:03:37,641
...who ask nothing of each other...

740
01:03:37,847 --> 01:03:41,044
...we know tey’re men with demands..

741
01:03:41,647 --> 01:03:46,437
These demands have to be satisfied 
before we leave this room..

742
01:03:47,047 --> 01:03:50,244
An with clear conscience 
we’ll forget what we saw..

743
01:03:52,647 --> 01:03:54,842
Why the hell didn’t you sign?

744
01:03:56,047 --> 01:03:57,639
I understand your question. 

745
01:03:58,287 --> 01:04:01,279
Really? 
The amount was huge.

746
01:04:01,487 --> 01:04:03,284
You’re getting on my nerves. 

747
01:04:13,487 --> 01:04:17,878
-I’m bored of your changing moods.
-You’re firing them

748
01:04:18,047 --> 01:04:21,244
You didn’t mention that.
You’re robbing them blind. 

749
01:04:22,287 --> 01:04:25,279
Brooker 5, whatever it is... 
You’re getting on my nerves.

750
01:04:32,487 --> 01:04:37,083
You’re the company’s lawyer 
and their friend.

751
01:04:37,287 --> 01:04:39,482
You should have told them 
to draft contracts.

752
01:04:39,647 --> 01:04:42,639
The don’t even suspect 
they will be losing their jobs. 

753
01:04:45,647 --> 01:04:48,036
-It’s very hard..
-You don’t say!

754
01:04:51,047 --> 01:04:52,844
Lets do this deal.

755
01:04:55,047 --> 01:04:58,244
That’s what I wanted to do 
But I’m willing to make a trade. 

756
01:04:58,287 --> 01:05:02,678
Confess! Admit you’re 
sucking their blood..

757
01:05:03,287 --> 01:05:06,677
-I promise you.
-I don’t trust you.

758
01:05:13,647 --> 01:05:16,445
All that you did was to fool me.

759
01:05:16,647 --> 01:05:19,241
Sign the promise that you will confess...

760
01:05:19,647 --> 01:05:22,241
...stealing their money and firing them.

761
01:05:22,487 --> 01:05:23,886
I did my best.

762
01:05:24,047 --> 01:05:26,242
I’m not happy signing something

763
01:05:26,287 --> 01:05:28,881
Idea is god.
You said it.

764
01:05:29,487 --> 01:05:31,682
Even if the writer was Hitler.

765
01:05:31,847 --> 01:05:34,645
I didn’t know then that Hitler 
Was indeed a writer..

766
01:05:36,047 --> 01:05:38,845
If you mean it that 
you’re confessing sign.

767
01:05:40,487 --> 01:05:44,480
At the highest price 
so no more tricks.

768
01:05:47,847 --> 01:05:49,246
Shut up over there!

769
01:06:08,647 --> 01:06:11,639
Today is a very hard day. 

770
01:06:17,287 --> 01:06:19,881
I decided to tell you something...

771
01:06:21,847 --> 01:06:25,044
...that I should have told you long ago..

772
01:06:31,287 --> 01:06:33,084
I cant do that...

773
01:06:33,487 --> 01:06:37,275
-You don’t have to say it.
-let him finish.

774
01:06:40,287 --> 01:06:41,879
I have to say it..

775
01:06:48,487 --> 01:06:51,877
Who’s never letting us down?

776
01:06:53,287 --> 01:06:54,481
Ravn.

777
01:06:55,047 --> 01:06:57,845
In whose arms we sink?

778
01:06:59,287 --> 01:07:00,481
Ravn’s

779
01:07:00,647 --> 01:07:04,037
Who owns the crown?

780
01:07:05,487 --> 01:07:07,079
Ravn

781
01:07:12,647 --> 01:07:15,639
You’re all so tender.
This makes it worse.

782
01:07:16,647 --> 01:07:19,445
If it’s so important, get it over with..

783
01:07:20,287 --> 01:07:24,883
-You’ll be angry.
-Even more so if you don’t say it.

784
01:07:26,847 --> 01:07:28,439
I had a plan.

785
01:07:31,847 --> 01:07:33,246
What plan?

786
01:07:37,047 --> 01:07:38,639
To fire all six of you. 

787
01:07:40,647 --> 01:07:41,841
Excuse me?

788
01:07:45,287 --> 01:07:50,077
I would fire you without 
compensating you for Brooker 5.

789
01:07:55,287 --> 01:07:56,879
Nice Plan

790
01:07:59,847 --> 01:08:01,439
Damn it Rvan

791
01:08:03,487 --> 01:08:04,681
Damn!

792
01:08:18,647 --> 01:08:22,037
Can I ask something 
before we all attack him?

793
01:08:23,047 --> 01:08:27,040
Why did you plan this?
Why fire us?

794
01:08:28,047 --> 01:08:30,845
-Why steel Brooker?
-Because...

795
01:08:31,847 --> 01:08:33,041
Yes?

796
01:08:34,487 --> 01:08:35,681
Because...

797
01:08:41,847 --> 01:08:44,042
...That’s what the Boss of it all said.

798
01:08:57,487 --> 01:08:59,682
We should have known it.

799
01:09:01,647 --> 01:09:04,639
He haven’t got the guts 
to tell us himself.

800
01:09:13,647 --> 01:09:16,036
-Autumn is gloomy...
-Gorm...

801
01:09:16,847 --> 01:09:19,441
-Autumn is gloomy.
-Stop it!

802
01:09:22,487 --> 01:09:25,479
Aytumn is fucking gloomy!

803
01:09:27,047 --> 01:09:28,844
Gorm. Stop it!

804
01:09:39,847 --> 01:09:43,044
I haven’t got the guts
They have a memory...

805
01:09:43,847 --> 01:09:45,041
...just like...

806
01:09:49,487 --> 01:09:50,886
An elephant’s? 

807
01:09:57,487 --> 01:10:00,479
Yes. I lay at night and see their eyes..

808
01:10:00,647 --> 01:10:05,243
You talk of forgiveness!
They’ll never forgive me.

809
01:10:05,847 --> 01:10:08,236
Pour Mette is the worst. .

810
01:10:08,647 --> 01:10:11,844
Nothing of what I’ll say
Will be good enough for that girl.

811
01:10:12,487 --> 01:10:14,079
I’m such a pussy!

812
01:10:14,287 --> 01:10:17,677
They will not forgive you 
If you don’t confess.

813
01:10:18,287 --> 01:10:19,879
We have a contract.

814
01:10:20,647 --> 01:10:23,844
“I promise to confess”.

815
01:10:26,647 --> 01:10:29,639
-Who signed it? 
-I confessed my plan.

816
01:10:30,287 --> 01:10:34,485
And said it was mine.
That’s not a confession.

817
01:10:34,847 --> 01:10:39,637
-I didn’t mean that.
-Why it’s not on the contarct?

818
01:10:41,287 --> 01:10:45,485
Unfirunately for you, 
law is an exact science.

819
01:10:46,047 --> 01:10:47,639
Therefore I demand...

820
01:10:48,487 --> 01:10:52,480
...to honour your contract and sell.

821
01:10:52,647 --> 01:10:56,640
I’ll arrange a last meeting with Finnur.

822
01:10:57,047 --> 01:11:00,835
I wouldn’t want you at work.

823
01:11:01,487 --> 01:11:04,479
I told them you’re in the states…

824
01:11:04,647 --> 01:11:07,445
...till the day of the signing.

825
01:11:20,647 --> 01:11:24,242
It’s me . We have to meet on neutral ground. 

826
01:11:38,487 --> 01:11:43,277
Legally you can’t touch him.
You have to sell.

827
01:11:44,487 --> 01:11:48,480
-It will be a disaster.
-Yes.

828
01:11:49,487 --> 01:11:51,876
But he almost confessed right?

829
01:11:52,847 --> 01:11:55,839
Being hard befits you .

830
01:11:57,647 --> 01:11:59,046
You’re right.

831
01:12:00,047 --> 01:12:03,835
I’m better at making people nervous.

832
01:12:04,287 --> 01:12:06,676
What is biggest fear?

833
01:12:08,487 --> 01:12:11,479
Not being loved. 
That what all this is about.

834
01:12:12,047 --> 01:12:16,837
He wants to be papa bear, or 
he’s not functioning properly. 

835
01:12:18,047 --> 01:12:20,845
So you’ll became papa bear.

836
01:12:22,287 --> 01:12:25,484
Do what Ravn did, only better.

837
01:12:36,487 --> 01:12:37,681
Morning.

838
01:12:57,487 --> 01:13:00,285
Do you have space for little me? 

839
01:13:04,647 --> 01:13:07,445
Ravn!
Sit with us.

840
01:13:08,487 --> 01:13:10,876
The more the merrier. 

841
01:13:11,047 --> 01:13:13,436
We thought you were in the states.

842
01:13:15,287 --> 01:13:18,484
I cans see my friends there all the time..

843
01:13:19,647 --> 01:13:22,445
But with my most precious friends...

844
01:13:23,487 --> 01:13:26,081
...can only spend two more days.

845
01:13:27,487 --> 01:13:29,876
-Right Ravn? 
-Yes..

846
01:13:31,047 --> 01:13:33,845
Two more days in our family’s bosom. 

847
01:13:35,847 --> 01:13:38,441
Autumn is a time bomb.

848
01:13:39,047 --> 01:13:43,438
Speaking of bombs
I have a confession to make.

849
01:13:44,047 --> 01:13:47,244
Things got excited the last time.

850
01:13:47,847 --> 01:13:52,637
If I tell you why I came back
you’ll see that you were wrong about me.

851
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:57,839
-You’re a bastard.
-Possibly 

852
01:13:58,287 --> 01:14:00,676
But not in the way you think

853
01:14:02,647 --> 01:14:05,241
I’ve been hiding things from you.

854
01:14:07,647 --> 01:14:10,445
Now everything is better, thanks.

855
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:16,637
I wasn’t alone in doing so.
Someone else was at the helm.

856
01:14:19,487 --> 01:14:23,082
This person should step forward.

857
01:14:24,847 --> 01:14:29,637
He’s someone above me. My boss..

858
01:14:30,647 --> 01:14:33,844
-This is getting complicated.
-And who’s this guy?

859
01:14:34,647 --> 01:14:35,841
He’s...

860
01:14:38,047 --> 01:14:40,641
...the boss of the Boss of it all.

861
01:14:46,487 --> 01:14:48,478
This is really getting complex.

862
01:14:49,287 --> 01:14:51,881
Can someone tell me 
what does this all means?

863
01:14:52,047 --> 01:14:53,241
No.

864
01:14:54,287 --> 01:14:57,677
So where’s the boss of the big boss?

865
01:14:58,287 --> 01:15:01,279
In the states.
No surprise here.

866
01:15:03,847 --> 01:15:07,840
So you’re not the one taking the decisions.

867
01:15:09,647 --> 01:15:13,037
I’ll have to disappoint Jokumsen here..

868
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:18,245
All his anger, as well as your anger...

869
01:15:19,487 --> 01:15:21,478
... is finding another target now.

870
01:15:24,487 --> 01:15:26,284
I’m glad to hear that.

871
01:15:33,287 --> 01:15:38,077
You’re a good guy. I knew it from the start.

872
01:15:41,647 --> 01:15:44,639
We should have known about these things.

873
01:15:44,847 --> 01:15:46,439
As the boss’s representative ...

874
01:15:47,047 --> 01:15:51,245
...i apologize for the Brooker thing.

875
01:15:52,647 --> 01:15:56,435
Because you were right from the beginning.

876
01:15:58,847 --> 01:16:01,441
You can’t but love this guy, right?

877
01:16:03,847 --> 01:16:07,044
And to cheer you up even more...

878
01:16:07,487 --> 01:16:10,684
...our staff trip to Kullen 
Will take place tommorrow.

879
01:16:11,487 --> 01:16:12,886
Perfect!

880
01:16:13,847 --> 01:16:16,042
Lets spend a nice day togeher.

881
01:16:16,487 --> 01:16:19,479
How about a group hug? Come Ravn

882
01:16:45,487 --> 01:16:47,079
What are you expecting to succeed? 

883
01:16:48,287 --> 01:16:50,676
Nothing. Just to have some fun. 

884
01:16:53,487 --> 01:16:54,886
Here we are. 

885
01:16:55,487 --> 01:16:58,684
Palnatoke was saying to Harald, how good a skier he is.

886
01:16:59,047 --> 01:17:03,837
“iI you’re that good ski all the way to Kullen” 

887
01:17:06,287 --> 01:17:09,279
-And he did. From here.
-And then?

888
01:17:11,047 --> 01:17:14,437
-I haven’t read further.
-Human Mistake. You’re evolving

889
01:17:17,487 --> 01:17:20,684
And now Palnatoke 
will do a demonstration…

890
01:17:21,287 --> 01:17:23,278
...of his unique style..

891
01:17:37,487 --> 01:17:39,000
What happened to your hand?

892
It’s my wrist.

893
01:17:44,647 --> 01:17:48,037
It went numb.
I’m afraid it will relapse.

894
01:17:48,287 --> 01:17:50,676
We’ll fix it soon.

895
01:18:02,647 --> 01:18:06,037
To the kindest of all men.

896
01:18:07,287 --> 01:18:08,481
To Svend.

897
01:18:09,487 --> 01:18:12,479
To our new best friend.

898
01:18:12,847 --> 01:18:14,041
To Svend.

899
01:18:14,487 --> 01:18:18,275
To he who gets 11 out of 10..

900
01:18:26,287 --> 01:18:28,278
More brandy please..

901
01:18:30,287 --> 01:18:34,485
I cant take it anymore.
They’re all parasites!

902
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:41,437
I’ll say it to the boss of the big boss.

903
01:18:43,647 --> 01:18:47,242
Look how you spend his money! 
You mane me sick.

904
01:18:58,287 --> 01:19:00,084
You found a way out..

905
01:19:01,487 --> 01:19:04,081
You’re extremely insipid. To put it mildly.

906
01:19:04,487 --> 01:19:07,684
You need insipid theatre
You can sink lower.

907
01:19:09,647 --> 01:19:11,797
Chamber realism, sentimentalism…

908
01:19:11,847 --> 01:19:13,838
...and cliches all around.

909
01:19:21,487 --> 01:19:22,681
Will you come?

910
01:19:25,487 --> 01:19:27,682
It’s time. Come on. 

911
01:19:39,847 --> 01:19:43,840
-Why did you come to the meeting?
-Because the boss of it all...

912
01:19:45,847 --> 01:19:48,839
Because the boss told you to come. 

913
01:20:01,047 --> 01:20:04,039
In five minutes we’ll be in our cars.

914
01:20:07,647 --> 01:20:10,639
-Do we have an agreement this time/
-Yes

915
01:20:14,487 --> 01:20:17,081
-Both on the price and the conditions?
-Yes.

916
01:20:19,847 --> 01:20:22,236
-Lets sign.
-yes.

917
01:20:22,647 --> 01:20:25,639
Now that it’s all settled...

918
01:20:26,287 --> 01:20:29,085
...let me send a message...

919
01:20:32,647 --> 01:20:36,037
These dates are all wrong. Shame!

920
01:20:36,487 --> 01:20:38,682
I’ll correct them. Sorry..

921
01:20:39,047 --> 01:20:40,446
...a message.

922
01:20:40,647 --> 01:20:44,242
On the anniversary of aunt Titi 
and uncle karl 

923
01:20:45,487 --> 01:20:48,285
...they set aside money in an old sock.

924
01:20:50,287 --> 01:20:53,484
They’ve been saving every day of their lives.

925
01:20:56,647 --> 01:20:58,239
In here...

926
01:20:59,647 --> 01:21:01,842
...we’ve been saving every day for 10 years.

927
01:21:02,287 --> 01:21:04,482
It’s the day for aunt Titi and unkle Karl...

928
01:21:04,647 --> 01:21:07,844
...as it will come to us once this party is over..

929
01:21:10,047 --> 01:21:13,835
We’ll wake up one day, well reach out…

930
01:21:16,647 --> 01:21:19,639
...and there, there will be nothing but air.

931
01:21:23,047 --> 01:21:24,241
And you...

932
01:21:24,847 --> 01:21:26,041
...and you...

933
01:21:27,647 --> 01:21:29,239
...and both of us...

934
01:21:29,647 --> 01:21:34,437
...and this three people we’re only a saga.

935
01:21:39,487 --> 01:21:42,877
You that you were once my whole life...

936
01:21:43,847 --> 01:21:46,645
...and me that once I was your’s...

937
01:21:47,647 --> 01:21:50,036
...we’ll never hold hands again.

938
01:21:53,487 --> 01:21:56,081
And for whom is this message? 

939
01:21:56,647 --> 01:22:01,437
For hir who curses himself for his 
wrongdoings before anyone else does so. 

940
01:22:01,847 --> 01:22:05,635
And who always forgives 
our errors first..

941
01:22:06,287 --> 01:22:09,484
-Who do I mean?
-Ravn...

942
01:22:10,487 --> 01:22:12,876
-Louder!
-Ravn.

943
01:22:14,287 --> 01:22:17,085
You carried us in your heart Ravn.

944
01:22:20,487 --> 01:22:24,878
You brought us close.
You spread your love..

945
01:22:28,847 --> 01:22:30,439
And now you go...

946
01:22:31,847 --> 01:22:34,236
...like a bubble in the water...

947
01:22:35,047 --> 01:22:39,245
...to move on to great things.
We can promise you one thing.

948
01:22:39,487 --> 01:22:43,480
By begging or biting
faraway or close...

949
01:22:44,287 --> 01:22:47,802
...you’ll always have a place in our hearts...

950
01:22:47,847 --> 01:22:50,645
...on this happy and green earth.

951
01:22:52,647 --> 01:22:56,435
Always.
You were always there for us.

952
01:22:57,047 --> 01:23:00,244
But who was there for you?

953
01:23:01,047 --> 01:23:04,244
But learn this, 
just like the swallows on the roofs,  

954
01:23:05,047 --> 01:23:09,837
...this is not goodbye,
but au revoir.

955
01:23:31,287 --> 01:23:35,485
Thanks for your words.
Let them be the last.

956
01:23:44,047 --> 01:23:47,835
Thanks for the sentimentality,
That was so hideous… 

957
01:23:48,287 --> 01:23:51,484
...that no one would take it seriously.

958
01:24:06,047 --> 01:24:08,436
You have something to say Mr Ravn 

959
01:24:09,287 --> 01:24:12,484
Is there something we didn’t notice?

960
01:24:16,047 --> 01:24:17,639
Tell us Mr Ravn

961
01:24:31,047 --> 01:24:33,436
II a the boss of it all.

962
01:24:36,647 --> 01:24:38,842
Its my company.

963
01:24:40,647 --> 01:24:42,444
I make the decisions

964
01:24:58,287 --> 01:25:00,278
Gorm is right.

965
01:25:00,487 --> 01:25:03,285
He’s right.
Autumn is gloomy.

966
01:25:04,647 --> 01:25:06,239
Really gloomy.

967
01:25:07,047 --> 01:25:08,844
Unbearably so. 

968
01:25:25,287 --> 01:25:26,481
I’m sorry.

969
01:25:30,487 --> 01:25:32,079
Thanks Ravn.

970
01:25:38,487 --> 01:25:41,285
Was that so hard to say?

971
01:25:44,647 --> 01:25:47,445
I always knew that you were the boss.

972
01:25:48,847 --> 01:25:52,044
You should have been stupid 
not to know.

973
01:25:56,047 --> 01:25:57,844
I forgive you Ravn

974
01:26:06,847 --> 01:26:08,041
Come on.

975
01:26:09,487 --> 01:26:10,681
Get up.

976
01:26:11,047 --> 01:26:12,241
All the way.

977
01:26:25,287 --> 01:26:27,881
So what about this signature.?

978
01:26:29,487 --> 01:26:31,079
You’re selling or what?

979
01:26:34,287 --> 01:26:36,084
There is a problem here.

980
01:26:37,847 --> 01:26:41,044
How can Kristoffer sell
something that doesn’t belong to him?

981
01:26:43,047 --> 01:26:45,641
Mr Sigursdon, there can be no selling. 

982
01:26:49,487 --> 01:26:52,081
The company is more united than ever.

983
01:26:53,847 --> 01:26:57,635
Even more now that all belong to the past..

984
01:26:58,287 --> 01:27:00,881
I have to start outsourcing.

985
01:27:05,047 --> 01:27:07,436
Exhausting our resources.

986
01:27:10,287 --> 01:27:15,077
You said outsourcing, the right
expression is exhaust the resources. 

987
01:27:16,647 --> 01:27:20,037
What you’re doing now 
is even more irritating.

988
01:27:21,047 --> 01:27:22,844
You forget the actor.

989
01:27:25,287 --> 01:27:26,879
Right. Sorry.

990
01:27:27,647 --> 01:27:30,639
I have to acknowledge 
that he made me confess..

991
01:27:31,047 --> 01:27:34,039
-Everything happened thanks to you..
-It’s all good...

992
01:27:36,847 --> 01:27:39,236
...but things don’t work like this..

993
01:27:41,647 --> 01:27:45,242
You don’t jump from hell to “...happily ever after”.

994
01:27:45,487 --> 01:27:48,081
A certain procedure must be followed..

995
01:27:48,487 --> 01:27:50,079
You’re right!

996
01:27:52,047 --> 01:27:55,244
Let’s cancel the contracts right now.

997
01:27:59,287 --> 01:28:03,678
And you resign from your right to sell. 

998
01:28:05,287 --> 01:28:07,482
-No.
-What?

999
01:28:09,487 --> 01:28:11,079
No. No. No. 

1000
01:28:11,487 --> 01:28:14,684
There are restrictions you cannot nullify.

1001
01:28:17,847 --> 01:28:20,042
We are not interested in the deal anymore...

1002
01:28:20,287 --> 01:28:23,085
...since the one signing it is not the boss.

1003
01:28:23,487 --> 01:28:26,877
Having read our Sagas my client knows 

1004
01:28:28,647 --> 01:28:32,037
...that he who negotiates with straw men...

1005
01:28:32,647 --> 01:28:35,036
...negotiates with nobody.

1006
01:28:46,287 --> 01:28:49,677
My client remembered some newer scriptures...

1007
01:28:50,287 --> 01:28:54,280
...that indicate a new understanding.

1008
01:28:54,847 --> 01:28:57,441
The right translation would be ...

1009
01:28:58,287 --> 01:29:01,279
He who negotiates with someone not authorised...

1010
01:29:01,647 --> 01:29:04,036
...negotiates with nobody.

1011
01:29:05,287 --> 01:29:08,882
My client believes that the man with the pen...

1012
01:29:09,047 --> 01:29:12,835
...has the authorization, so he is okay with it.

1013
01:29:18,287 --> 01:29:21,882
What’s going on Kristoffer?
Everything’s happening just like you wanted.

1014
01:29:23,487 --> 01:29:24,681
More or less.

1015
01:29:26,287 --> 01:29:28,881
-You’re not going to sign?
-This is above me.

1016
01:29:29,487 --> 01:29:31,079
I’m just an actor.

1017
01:29:31,647 --> 01:29:34,445
If I sign or not is up to my character.

1018
01:29:35,047 --> 01:29:37,436
I’ll have to ask him.

1019
01:29:39,287 --> 01:29:42,085
It’s your character whose to blame for all this.

1020
01:29:42,487 --> 01:29:44,876
It will probably a quick affair.

1021
01:29:45,287 --> 01:29:48,085
I need time and space to consult my character.

1022
01:29:48,287 --> 01:29:51,085
After all he’s the Boss of it All.

1023
01:29:55,047 --> 01:29:56,241
What is happening?

1024
01:29:57,047 --> 01:30:00,039
His feelings are conflicted. He’s an actor. 

1025
01:30:01,047 --> 01:30:03,845
He couldn’t have Rvan get all the attention.

1026
01:30:05,487 --> 01:30:08,877
He’s putting on a show now that everybody’s looking.

1027
01:30:09,647 --> 01:30:10,841
I hope so…

1028
01:30:26,287 --> 01:30:29,484
No! Wait a sec. 

1029
01:30:34,647 --> 01:30:37,036
I cant make contact.

1030
01:30:37,847 --> 01:30:40,645
I hear the boss saying something.

1031
01:30:41,847 --> 01:30:44,839
And then it can be something else.

1032
01:30:46,287 --> 01:30:47,879
Quiet back there!

1033
01:30:50,487 --> 01:30:53,479
You have to put life in your material.

1034
01:30:54,487 --> 01:30:57,877
What are your character’s values?

1035
01:30:59,047 --> 01:31:00,639
Its exciting.

1036
01:31:04,847 --> 01:31:07,839
And to be absolutely true...

1037
01:31:11,047 --> 01:31:13,242
... I have no idea.

1038
01:31:15,487 --> 01:31:19,480
Likes and dislikes go hand in hand.

1039
01:31:19,647 --> 01:31:21,638
I’ll listen some more.

1040
01:31:31,047 --> 01:31:32,241
I got it!

1041
01:31:41,047 --> 01:31:44,437
Almost there, but my sympathies...

1042
01:31:44,647 --> 01:31:47,639
...seem to lie with Ravn and his staff..

1043
01:31:53,487 --> 01:31:55,079
Shitty Danes !

1044
01:31:59,047 --> 01:32:02,835
Our damn babbling made us 
suffer for 400 years. 

1045
01:32:04,847 --> 01:32:07,645
Is this idiot going to sign or not. 

1046
01:32:10,847 --> 01:32:13,236
I hate Danish people!

1047
01:32:20,487 --> 01:32:22,682
What was that last thing?

1048
01:32:23,847 --> 01:32:28,238
He said the whole thing was absurd. 
Absurd like...

1049
01:32:29,487 --> 01:32:30,681
Gambini.

1050
01:32:32,647 --> 01:32:33,841
Gambini?

1051
01:32:35,847 --> 01:32:38,042
Antonio Stavro Gambini

1052
01:32:38,847 --> 01:32:41,839
“The Hanged Cat”.
One act play, 1969

1053
01:32:47,047 --> 01:32:49,436
Some say late 1968…

1054
01:32:53,047 --> 01:32:54,241
Shit!

1055
01:33:48,647 --> 01:33:51,036
Forget about it it’s Gambini’s fault. 

1056
01:34:09,847 --> 01:34:12,236
The chimney sweepers monologue.

1057
01:34:18,647 --> 01:34:21,844
And here we are at the point were we reach...

1058
01:34:22,487 --> 01:34:24,682
...the end of our comedy.

1059
01:34:25,047 --> 01:34:28,835
Just like you, I would like to go home...

1060
01:34:29,847 --> 01:34:32,236
...but I would like to apologize...

1061
01:34:32,287 --> 01:34:34,881
...to those who wanted more and to those who wanted less.

1062
01:34:35,047 --> 01:34:38,244
They who got what they wanted,
got what they deserved…

1063
01:34:40,287 --> 01:34:43,085

1064
01:34:44,305 --> 01:34:50,527
