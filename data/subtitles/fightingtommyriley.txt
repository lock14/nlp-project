1
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:43,074
Are you ready?

2
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:01,789
SEVEN MONTHS EARLIER

3
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,471
Constantly we promised that you will change, not
mijenjaš it. - Shatters from liability, I will quit!

4
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:09,919
I am guaranteed to you in this business.
And what time will it achieve?

5
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,679
Look, tomorrow you have no more excuses.
If we do that, then do it.

6
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:51,389
You should see a boxer...

7
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,878
Thank you, thank you...

8
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:11,316
Thank you, my favorite classes.

9
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:17,475
"It is better to die in that gaping infinity

10
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:24,193
but infamously rush lee
even if it is security.

11
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:30,433
What do you think that the message of the novel?

12
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,158
Does anyone know?

13
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,311
Enjoy the holiday.
Pleasant Ijeto you, Mr. P.

14
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,069
Dad is not feeling the best.

15
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:47,513
The first day of the rest of your life.
Let's go.

16
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,272
It's on... called Martinez.
Undefeated.

17
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,117
Professor, how are you?
Well, hecto, all the "bueno".

18
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,558
Good look, bro.
What can I say.

19
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,794
I'm glad to see you back in business.
This is my partner, Diane Stone. It's nice to meet you.

20
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,114
I brought the boy to be seen sparring
my boxers. Later we'll talk.

21
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,193
Come on, girls. It is not
so bad.

22
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:49,875
Come on, man, get up.

23
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,799
Let's go!

24
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,119
Fuck off out of my gym.
Do not go no money.

25
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,558
Nothing I will not pay you. Bugger off
here before and I take out.

26
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:29,710
Professor, it was a cheap trick, you know?

27
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,315
Get out of here!

28
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,072
Professor, give my boyfriend a couple of minutes. He will be ok.
It will take more than a few minutes, Hector.

29
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:54,910
What the hell are you doing this?
Are you looking for talent? There he is.

30
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,790
Who is he to hell. Nothing about him we do not know.
Stop it. Call it.

31
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,393
Hey, boy, come here.
Tell that bastard son, that I will not.

32
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,870
It does not interest us.
We are not here because of that.

33
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:12,158
I'm Diane Stone, and this is
my partner Marty Goldberg.

34
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,596
Good work in there.

35
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:19,196
Tommy.
Hi, Tommy.

36
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,911
I know who you are. Once you're trained Silas,
is not it? He fought for the title 1999th Mr.

37
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,278
Prior to this he was an excellent boxer.

38
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,113
Can you?

39
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:35,398
I read about you in the newspaper.
What are you doing here?

40
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:38,393
Good question.
I watched the match.

41
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,350
Was supposed to win.
We almost did.

42
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:47,433
"Almost" is a bitch.
We both pretty impressed with what you did there.

43
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:52,958
Who trained you? - Self-training.
- Do you have any manager?

44
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,477
Do you see that razbacujem dollars this way?

45
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:00,677
Are you razmišIjao to
professional boxing you do?

46
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:05,755
Yes, then I wake up
and I have to work like everyone else.

47
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:09,310
We are looking for a good middle-weight.
Let us treat you dinner.

48
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,119
I have to go home. I'm late.
Please wait.

49
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:16,114
Call us in the morning. Ugovoricemo something

50
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:21,513
to earn some money, to izvuceš
from these holes. Do you need transportation? - No, thanks.

51
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:28,832
I'm glad to meet you, Tommy.
And you're right, "almost" is a bitch.

52
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:34,912
There are a lot of talent
that at his age would not be used.

53
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:40,313
He still needs a lot of
work. I do not know.

54
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,598
The kind of person with stroke even better...
They can sell it immediately.

55
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:48,912
Workout here. With the worst.
Damn it, Marty. Do not start with that crap again.

56
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,392
In the end, you're uvukao me into this.
I do not know if I have it in you anymore.

57
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,757
I believe in you.

58
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,798
Hello.

59
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,519
Sometimes with was so passionate...
full of life.

60
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:31,233
We no longer know who you are.
As for anything that does not exist.

61
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:38,114
I do not know what you feel or think
because you just exclude me.

62
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:43,474
I do not know what else to do.
The fact that I moved did not help.

63
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,511
I love you, Tommy, really
with all my heart and soul.

64
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,515
But just like
no longer can.

65
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,514
Ok, do not fit. Do not forsake bag.

66
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:13,312
Will tell you when to hit,
just as the opponent. I stop.

67
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:16,711
Right side holds back as if waiting for an attack.
Yes, sir.

68
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,556
Call me Marty.
Yes, sir, excuse me, I think Marty.

69
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,315
It is my habit.
It's okay.

70
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,392
Let the shoulder to move.

71
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,513
Kid looks good, Professor. But the bag
unresponsive shock. - What she said, grandparents?

72
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:36,070
Decline, Mobley.

73
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:47,914
Learn to control that anger.
It seems to me a better boxer.

74
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,272
If you are a professional,
then and Behave.

75
00:14:53,640 --> 00:14:57,679
OK, enough.
Vacations bag.

76
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,754
Are we finished?
I saw everything you need to see.

77
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:07,755
Will I sparingovati?
No, I saw enough.

78
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:13,074
I know I'm a little rusty, it's been a long time...
You do not need me to sell.

79
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:19,156
What does it mean?
Anything you say will change what you see.

80
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:29,469
Tell me about yourself.
What are you doing?

81
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,759
Expands computer cables.

82
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:38,833
Can I ask you something?
Sure.

83
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,518
What do you want?

84
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:50,393
What do you think?
Why are we here?

85
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:58,399
Why boksuješ?
I have nothing else to do.

86
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,236
You're talented, but talent is given to you.
The question is what do you want to do with her?

87
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:09,748
You have chosen to come here.
Because I see potential, but it does just that.

88
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:15,719
Understand what you are talking. Continue.
No! I do not understand.

89
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:19,998
I would not even their Tracie neither my
time I do not think you're special.

90
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:25,954
You will work hard.
I work hard. - Then listen. - I listen.

91
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,192
Do me a favor.

92
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:33,239
Do me a favor. Sit and silent!

93
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:46,274
Whatever the "special" is in
the madness, I think that you have.

94
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:52,197
If you want to iskoristiš that you've got,
shut up and listen. I think we have something here.

95
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:59,276
I had several conversations about Tommyja
and received three bids, but I think we should...

96
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,070
Do not do anything until
do not see in the ring. Pepper!

97
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,391
Mobley?

98
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:12,076
Test this guy.
No fractures.

99
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,552
Tommy... three rounds.

100
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:25,476
It's okay.
I do not care how much you're fine. Make it.

101
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,714
Ready? Go.

102
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,510
To hit harder, a bastard son?

103
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:14,192
Are you okay?
Yes, I'm fine.

104
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:18,478
Lucky strike.
For today is enough.

105
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,679
You said three rounds.
Oboricu it. I'm fine.

106
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:27,756
I'm there to worry about whether you're good.
If you continue so, you will have to present the sale.

107
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:33,870
I do not want to think about...
Come on, you were good. Come on, go to the opera.

108
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,994
I'll take it.

109
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:50,188
He was good.

110
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,069
What was it the hell?

111
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,669
Hey.

112
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:11,954
How are you?

113
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:18,872
I'm fine. I'm sorry for what...
No, my job is to worry. Come on, I'll help you.

114
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,195
Here it is.

115
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,352
I sought you in the archives.
You did not tell me that you fought for the Olympics.

116
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,909
Yes.
I?

117
00:19:57,080 --> 00:20:01,835
I'm lost.
What happened?

118
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:08,359
The first time I then knocked out.

119
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:14,038
This is all happening.
Not me.

120
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:28,552
This tattoo. What does the "S"?

121
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:35,393
Stephanie.
Girl.

122
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,513
I do not know. It's a long story.

123
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,198
What are you doing for dinner?
I am preparing myself home.

124
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,717
You Kuvasz?
Spaghetti, pasta, soup...

125
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:52,031
Purchased items.

126
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:56,716
I'll make you something once.
I am a great cook.

127
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,997
Maybe too good.

128
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:29,153
Ovoda gotta see. I think
to smop may bet on the wrong horse.

129
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:33,598
What is it?
Qualifying for the Olympics, 1999. Mr.

130
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:38,437
Riley entered the finals as a
knocked out Antonio Castilloa.

131
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:45,392
A good first Round of Riley. Both boxers
using short strokes, but Riley dealt several blows stronger.

132
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,078
It seems to be disagreed Rileyov angle.
Again we see treberov temperament

133
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,277
Riley is almost
disqualified in the semifinals.

134
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,115
What is wrong? When the game starts,
let the guy to boksuje.

135
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,673
This is a psychological confusion. You need to keep him focused.
Hitherto it has brought, there may be some of their methods.

136
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,872
Kane attacks Riley
Raging blows.

137
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,919
Riley does not use your instinct and
what led him this far,

138
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,753
I mean, the guy looks like
is not afraid to make mistakes.

139
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,435
Kane hitting Riley in the head and
Riley was shot down.

140
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:26,229
Coach Riley to scream to get up.

141
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:30,837
What to do? This is stupid. Amateur.
Keep the boxers on the floor

142
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,151
while counting judges and give Man
opportunity to return to his legs.

143
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,038
Referee checks and Riley
lets continue to fight.

144
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,882
Kane Zasip blows...
so it must be finished off.

145
00:22:38,974 --> 00:22:41,856
After one nokdauna Kane has an advantage.

146
00:22:41,949 --> 00:22:45,226
I would be in skin Ruleyovoj now.
Because he needs a knockout in the last round that won?

147
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:46,817
No, because they must return to the corner.
This is an abuse of boys by the coaches.

148
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,887
Riley almost can not participate
the qualifications for the preparation of the

149
00:22:48,978 --> 00:22:52,017
Coach Holt clamored to him
"Teaching" him not to be hit.

150
00:22:52,812 --> 00:22:55,475
I could not believe it
when I heard, but I believe now.

151
00:22:55,567 --> 00:22:57,854
The doctor approached Rileyevom corner of the judge and
check him your hand. Riley jauce of pain.

152
00:22:57,946 --> 00:23:00,032
The match is over.
Referee stops the match

153
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:02,590
and Leroy Kane goes to the Olympics.

154
00:23:02,684 --> 00:23:04,927
I'm glad for Kane, a good boxer,
but I was sorry about Riley.

155
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:07,614
He had complete control from beginning
while his coach did not enter into combat confusion.

156
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,648
But sorry Riley...

157
00:23:31,560 --> 00:23:33,596
Steph?

158
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,679
Zdavo, what happens?

159
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:44,036
How are you?
Good.

160
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:51,390
You were sleeping?
Yes.

161
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:57,277
You're a little wear.

162
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,549
Take care of themselves?
Yes.

163
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:16,430
You have a lot of good fighters here?

164
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:25,557
Since when is this?
Ago.

165
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:35,317
I watched clips from
qualifications.

166
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:42,356
Who is the coach?
Stepfather.

167
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:47,036
Boxing is a team sport.
Most people do not realize

168
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,796
because they see only one man in the ring.

169
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,078
But ask any of them,
have never been alone

170
00:24:56,240 --> 00:25:00,518
Kane was alone,
but you were.

171
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,832
If you are not part of a team, better
not pojavljuješ.

172
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:08,117
Have you read Moby Dick when at school?

173
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:13,274
No. But I watched the movie.

174
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:17,797
It is a novel. Podsjecaš me in a paragraph.

175
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,350
"It is better to die in that gaping infinity

176
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:27,152
but infamously rush lee
even if it is security.

177
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:32,318
One day, not now...
when you are older

178
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:39,272
when you really understand what is important, when it
too late, when the osvrneš and wish that you made a different choice.

179
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:45,436
I appreciate that you came and care,
but I'm fine, because...

180
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,399
I was the champion of the Marines and I got
many offers to boksujem professional.

181
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:57,714
However, did have
unfortunate things, and say

182
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,158
I felt that you do not deserve
to me all these good things happen.

183
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,269
I could not understand what other people
saw in me, I did it I could see.

184
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,992
So I hand proturio
through the window, damaged nerves...

185
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,994
I have done it

186
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:21,597
I no longer have to spar.

187
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:27,073
I'm talking like you now. At that time
I did not believe in what and no one.

188
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:31,233
I see where it led.

189
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:36,713
In you I see the light that is
I long ago came from.

190
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,797
Doing to regret for what could
be a dream what can be.

191
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:49,512
We will do this together, eh?

192
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:56,794
Come here.
What?

193
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:03,035
I want to kiss you.
I do not need a hug.

194
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:06,756
Maybe I should, tough guys.

195
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,395
I believe in you.

196
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:26,198
Anger is the wind, which turns off
lamp of the mind.

197
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,512
You have to control your anger, Tommy,
that he would not control you.

198
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:40,635
If you want to conquered the best, you can only
boksiješ, Tommy. You have to learn how to nadmudriš.

199
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:46,033
When you come into the ring, I will be there with you,
will look each of his movement, will seek the hole.

200
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:49,590
And it still exists.
I find it and I will give to you.

201
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:54,436
We are a team, Tommy, the two of us together,
nothing can stop us. Nothing.

202
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,672
What was no longer.

203
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:03,915
You should see this.
D all get an offer.

204
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,470
Soon more will not be able to afford it, believe me.

205
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:13,078
I knew you were smarter than
you are talking about. See you on 17

206
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:21,996
All you have to do is that we believe.
Vjerij, perform.

207
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:35,832
What is this?
When you did this?

208
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:40,152
Lucy helped me.
How about this, huh?

209
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:44,230
Last week, this place was rubble.

210
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:46,789
Check this out!

211
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,191
Fine.

212
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,956
Now we can do alone. No one can
study. Maintenance element of surprise.

213
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:02,908
But now you have to start to train full time.
Yes, I'm ready.

214
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,548
You will leave the job.

215
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,350
I can not leave the job. Work is all I have.
Do not worry about work, work is past.

216
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,956
This is your future, Tommy.

217
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:19,148
Do not worry, Diane and I will take care
on your costs and you, ok?

218
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:35,955
I came just to see how you are.

219
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:40,238
Tommy, this is Brad.
Brad, this is Tommy.

220
00:29:42,520 --> 00:29:44,988
Tommy, stop!

221
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,109
Tommy!

222
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:24,354
I was passing by...
Yes, go.

223
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,796
You sure?
Yes, certainly.

224
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:33,034
Lucy, this is Tommy.
Tommy, this is Lucy.

225
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,317
Enter. Are you hungry? Will have something to eat?
No, thanks.

226
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:46,911
Are you actually read all these books?
The most part.

227
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:51,119
If you see something you like,
go ahead and take it.

228
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:02,119
Here's something you will perhaps be interesting,
"David Copperfield."

229
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:06,353
The magician, right?
Not really.

230
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:09,512
Sit, let's eat.

231
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:19,872
It was the first person who really got me.

232
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:24,352
I understand, made to feel the...

233
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:27,592
like I'm ok.

234
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:34,114
Come to all my matches,
adored it.

235
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,754
I feel so good with it there.

236
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:47,112
And then I lost the qualification, and we planned
to go in the pros after the Olympics, so...

237
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:50,238
Your stepfather?

238
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,029
Sometimes I like to boksujem.

239
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:02,915
And the match I pobjedivao.

240
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:12,717
When I returned home,
all my things were ahead.

241
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,669
We have always been
a favorite topic of your neighbors.

242
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,189
Steph then decided to move here
and we seemed like a good idea to come with her

243
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:27,432
to help her to put

244
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:32,594
and that we may give an opportunity
to come up with what I will do that.

245
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:40,275
Three and a half years later...
What a pity. The idea that all that talent went out of the ring.

246
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:45,869
It is good that I encountered.

247
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,031
Tommy, the discipline.

248
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:04,118
Tommy, hands up!

249
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:15,194
Not rising to the end of the countdown.

250
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:44,358
Get up, Get up, jeb'o you!

251
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:48,870
Get up!

252
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,550
Use the countdown.

253
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:15,116
Are you okay?

254
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:26,237
What is going on, Tommy?
Give it to me, come on.

255
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:33,955
What's happening?
Hand me slomnjena. Quit match.

256
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:36,953
What?
Right?

257
00:34:37,120 --> 00:34:42,114
Quit match. I can not fight.
Do not interrupt the match!

258
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:46,478
You only life to throw you
can not go back there, understand?

259
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:49,518
I can not...
Listen to me.

260
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:54,754
"If you can keep your head up when you think you lose,
if you can trust yourself when all doubt you,

261
00:34:54,920 --> 00:35:00,392
if you can force your heart and
mind and nerves that those tears,

262
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:04,997
long before disappearing,
you'll be a man, my son. "Kipling.

263
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:08,232
On body and mind,

264
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:11,631
and finish it this right.

265
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:56,152
What is your arm hurt?
To the right.

266
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,598
That's what I thought. The first boxing rules and
first rule of life, and tonight you learned it.

267
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:05,231
Never cease to beat.
Just hit. Dudes you hit, you will always have a chance.

268
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,994
Who is it written?
I.

269
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:12,671
Give us a couple of minutes
and we will be ready for dinner.

270
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,879
Listen, Diane, if mnorate to save
honor your servant, will go to dinner.

271
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:21,511
But I have to be honest with
you, this will not happen.

272
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:28,157
It will take him three or four buckles, but it's nothing.
Lie down, you will, Tommy?

273
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:40,233
Thank you.
She touches you.

274
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:47,639
Maybe you have a milder concussion,
therefore probably should not be alone tonight.

275
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:52,032
Do you have a code to be with you?

276
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,272
No.

277
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:00,036
Would you stay with me?
Yes, of course.

278
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:06,432
Marty, I'm afraid of needles.

279
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:10,992
Do not be afraid of you nothing.

280
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:18,270
Closes his eyes and not move.
For the moment you go from here.

281
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:26,392
Blow when you do not see that coming
causes the most damage.

282
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,035
Is that right?
Yes, it's good.

283
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:37,751
You are relaxed, Tommy.
Never spuštaj hand.

284
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,110
But it worked,
Sugar Ray did it.

285
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:47,195
Well, you're not But not Sugar Ray.
Oh no.

286
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:52,354
Stupid, huh?
No, just another lesson learned.

287
00:37:52,520 --> 00:37:56,672
Yes, this hurts.
The good hurt.

288
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,833
Cheers. - Tomorrow when you wake up I keep the movies.
What do you say to that?

289
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:04,834
Tomorrow, no training?
Got a couple of days free. - You're darežIjiv.

290
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:08,390
Just do not tell anyone.
Agreed.

291
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:29,078
Where did you get all that?
I got up early and went shopping.

292
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:34,155
I filled the fridge.
Even I myself bought a low fat breakfast. Proud?

293
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:37,153
Yes, every honor.

294
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:41,871
I see it around.
Seems to be fine.

295
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:47,278
Just to open.

296
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:55,079
Hello.

297
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:03,159
I thought that you need it.
God, what happened to your eye?

298
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:05,754
Nothing...

299
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:12,158
Oh, God, sorry...
It's not what you think. Enter.

300
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,910
Marty, this is Stephanie.
Stephanie, this is Marty.

301
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:25,037
I have heard many things about you.

302
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:28,869
Marty is my coach.
We won last night.

303
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,556
We knocked out type.
That's great.

304
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:38,999
About these horrible looking.
No, it's okay.

305
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:46,789
BREAKFAST, so I will...
No, stop. Stay.

306
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:52,074
It's OK, Marty, there are a lot of food.
Yes.

307
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,437
You'll be all right?
Yes. Everything is fine. I'll call you later.

308
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:07,754
Yes, of course. Do not do anything... It does not matter.

309
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:14,108
Marty seems fine.
To a great head.

310
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:19,877
When did you know?
He and his partner have come to train at Al Raya.

311
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:23,669
Now that you're best friends?

312
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:29,113
What are you, Ijubomorna?
No.

313
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:34,070
As soon as I came to see you,
in the kitchen preparing a stranger you breakfast.

314
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:39,712
I do not know what to think.
Marty is my coach.

315
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,149
You are vidaš with other people,
and you make me guilty?

316
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:50,836
It was not out, was a charity dinner and
Brad I just connected. - Yes, I bet it is.

317
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:59,159
Sorry.

318
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:10,039
Why did you come here?
I just wanted to see how you are.

319
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:15,150
I missed me.

320
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,632
Am I missing you?

321
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:27,589
You look different.
How?

322
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,198
Otherwise good.

323
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:37,873
Steph, what's going on?

324
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,636
You're poludio.

325
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:55,432
It is an investment. Write-off.
We do not need write-off. We need a subscription.

326
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:59,878
How much this cost me?
This is my personal savings.

327
00:42:00,040 --> 00:42:04,079
Your guy has beaten a night.
We won, right?

328
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:09,678
This call victory? We lost
they jerk from HBO's.

329
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:13,675
What ciljaš?
- We cut off the Tommyjem losses and move on.

330
00:42:14,075 --> 00:42:15,534
I do not think the winner and I think this does to himself.

331
00:42:15,720 --> 00:42:19,872
Now you are an expert?
No, but I talked with other people and they agree.

332
00:42:20,040 --> 00:42:25,990
Do not talk to other people but with me.
You do not see clearly, get rid of him.

333
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:28,754
I do not do.

334
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:32,316
I remember the girl who was too
shy to look at other people's eyes.

335
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:38,191
Fleeing from the school, the drugs.
Predozirala pills and stuck to rinse the stomach.

336
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,590
Do it be? Do you remember "experts"

337
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:46,949
who told me that I need
out of school because not worth anything?

338
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:55,876
But I do not listen to experts.
I listen to your heart. I was with her.

339
00:42:57,520 --> 00:43:04,471
It seems to me that it goes quite well
because someone gave her a little Ijubavi, religion

340
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,871
and opportunity.

341
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:13,910
We do not need another opportunity,
I know what I see.

342
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:19,518
I see potential in this guy and let
damned if I let you fail.

343
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:29,719
It's a good guy. Only
I do not want to be injured.

344
00:43:29,880 --> 00:43:33,395
It will not allow it.

345
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:41,314
What's next? - Kaneo have posted a bid...
- Kaneo have posted a bid? Accept it!

346
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:46,918
Are you sure it's ready?
Accept it! Accept it!

347
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:04,349
Hey, Marty, this is business, not personal.

348
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:11,593
I know.

349
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:19,914
Tommy, Marty said. I have wonderful news.

350
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:27,638
We managed! Diane contract
Leroy match with Kane. For four weeks.

351
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:32,794
This is serious. - And that's how.
- Is that enough time?

352
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,715
Yes, do not you read? Kane's
broke both of the article during the training.

353
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:43,392
It turns out, you upadaš. They think that you
be an easy opponent. But they think wrong.

354
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:50,158
Hi, Marty.
God, I'm sorry. I did not know that...

355
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:54,313
I tried to call, but
the phone was busy.

356
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:57,558
Yes, we remove the headset.

357
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:03,352
Can we razgovarmo in the hallway?
No, I'm already going to the bathroom.

358
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:13,794
I have a hut on the lake. I think it would be
good idea to go from here briefly.

359
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,396
Less interference. You are right on time
we do not have much time to prepare, because...

360
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:25,395
Pens like Kane,
We can shoot at Norris.

361
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:28,191
Whatever you think is best, ok?

362
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,392
This place is unbelievable.

363
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,631
Are there bears here?

364
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:42,678
I do not know about bears.

365
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,789
No! No spuštaj below.
Sorry.

366
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,077
Add me.

367
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:01,751
Sorry.
No, you did not know.

368
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:07,358
She had an accident when she was
rat. Not seen in the left eye.

369
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:12,878
Some squirrel was chased.
Go.

370
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:16,712
It is too vulnerable.

371
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:30,638
Tommy, take one down the room.
I think the warmest.

372
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:36,033
I'll take this one.
I love that I'm close to the bathroom.

373
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,070
Okay, go. One hour, a minute longer.

374
00:47:41,240 --> 00:47:45,711
Give it to me, please.
Music, please.

375
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,632
You have to learn to motivate himself.

376
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:55,511
That the environment affects you. Do not block it.
Okay?

377
00:47:55,800 --> 00:48:00,954
The ring will be no music. Is that right?

378
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:06,313
OK?
All right.

379
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:58,031
Here it is again. Left hook.
This is his big shot.

380
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:02,398
Pomjerice to
to set them for the left hook.

381
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:28,438
How do you stop it?

382
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:34,630
To keep my right hand up.
That's it. This will help much.

383
00:50:38,440 --> 00:50:41,477
Here we like it.

384
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,792
We should be moving here.
Lived the good life.

385
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:50,351
All serious boxers usually
complete living with coaches.

386
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:54,672
Bllo would be great.
It would be like this every day.

387
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:59,709
You stand up and trciš, I am preparing breakfast.
Let's go to the movies.

388
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:04,750
I would maintain about you. Took care that my champion is
all he needs. - Is Silas lived with you?

389
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,829
Yes. I cooked every meal for him.
What happened?

390
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:15,836
Sharks šcepale him.
Seduced him great promises

391
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:20,516
They told him that it inhibits.
After a while they started to believe.

392
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:25,674
Kicked and after which you have
led to the match for the title? - It happens.

393
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:29,509
Jerk.
Have we been Ijut, that upset, yes.

394
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:34,595
But in the end I tried to understand.
Do not judge people, try to understand them.

395
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:38,309
Why?
What is the purpose of it?

396
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:42,917
From a real world place a lot of hatred.
And that's enough.

397
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:49,989
You never know what tragedy is waiting for someone after awakening.
What you see is what you get. - So I see?

398
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:56,269
Talk about it. - No, on all of us.
- No, I talk about it, okay? You're not fucked him.

399
00:51:56,440 --> 00:51:59,079
You think you know everything about me?

400
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:03,358
Yes... no, I think I know who you are.
You know just what I am allowing you to see.

401
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:08,594
What does that supposed to mean?
Nothing.

402
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:13,117
What do you want to say?
Only that people not always what you see.

403
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:18,513
I am more than what you see.
All of us.

404
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:22,709
What you talking about?
Do you know why I like the rain?

405
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:29,399
Because it gives me a reason to stay inside.
I like winter because the days are shorter and night falls in 4 hours.

406
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:36,079
Sometimes the only thing that I am rising from the bed
utiješna thought that I will return to it when night falls.

407
00:52:36,680 --> 00:52:43,438
Then every night I wake
terrified, mute, paralyzed.

408
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:48,714
I lay there and how razmišIjam
I can not come to the pill.

409
00:52:49,080 --> 00:52:52,993
really know what the hell.

410
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:59,951
I'm afraid of loneliness, I'll die alone.

411
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:05,598
Nec never be, no one cares.
D I'm afraid to sleep,

412
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:12,159
but are too scared to be awake

413
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:17,474
because they can not isboriti with
own thoughts with them himself.

414
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:25,998
Do you know that I have most of his life
I spent wanting someone else?

415
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:31,188
Do I have never had the courage to
I like someone who would not back Ijubav.

416
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:43,109
I love dogs. My dog
life companion, Tommy.

417
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:47,394
Do you know why?

418
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,872
Because when I wake up in the morning,
she was there, waving his tail. No matter what.

419
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:57,273
Every day. I like to watch me
I am the only thing that matters.

420
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,877
I am her everything.

421
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:08,030
I can not sleep knowing that she
will never reveal anything about me

422
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,749
why will not escape.

423
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:16,277
So razmišIjaj, Tommy, before osudiš someone.

424
00:54:16,440 --> 00:54:20,115
People are naive and stupid.
We all make mistakes,

425
00:54:20,280 --> 00:54:23,875
Sorry...
Silas was a good guy.

426
00:54:24,040 --> 00:54:27,350
He had problems.
We had problems.

427
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:32,799
But he did just what
thought that it must do so.

428
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:39,593
What problems?
It does not matter now.

429
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:46,554
It is important to understand
of which you speak.

430
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:51,590
Ok, I understand.

431
00:54:56,920 --> 00:55:01,118
He won the title that stayed with you.

432
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:05,273
We will never know.
Yes, we will.

433
00:55:21,320 --> 00:55:23,515
Stop!

434
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,548
Stop, stop...

435
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:31,552
OK, enough.

436
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:44,030
That's all for today.
We are a real team, huh?

437
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:51,954
Well we go, right? - Yes.

438
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:57,399
You know what, Kane is in distress.

439
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:11,589
The trouble is. It has to go back
broken nose in Philadelphiju.

440
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:21,152
Too much talk. Relax.
Relax a little.

441
00:56:21,320 --> 00:56:24,471
Breath.

442
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:31,515
That's it.

443
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:39,512
This is better.
Marty, I just want you to know...

444
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:42,831
If it was not you...

445
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:51,035
It's okay.

446
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,914
What was that?

447
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:59,796
Marty? You're kidding, right?

448
00:58:02,880 --> 00:58:07,192
Lord, I'm sorry, Tommy.
What's happening?

449
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:12,753
Sorry... I thought...
You're kidding, right?

450
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:20,634
Blla was a mistake, I thought...

451
00:58:24,360 --> 00:58:26,954
Sorry.

452
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:54,033
What happened there?
Nothing. Forget it, please.

453
00:58:54,200 --> 00:58:58,876
Shit! What was that?

454
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:04,797
I do not think I'm...
No, Tommy, no. It was my fault.

455
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:08,034
Sorry.

456
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:16,309
Please, tell me why we did not here.
No, of course not. It was a mistake. You're not done nothing wrong.

457
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:25,956
Razumjecu if you wish to proceed to train with someone else.
What you talking about?

458
00:59:28,520 --> 00:59:34,436
We are a team, right?
Like you said, we're a team, right?

459
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:38,513
Say it was a coincidence, right?
Yes, it was an accident.

460
00:59:38,680 --> 00:59:44,357
So everything is fine then?
None of which should be talking about?

461
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:49,919
You sure?
Yes.

462
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:02,037
What's happening?

463
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:06,873
Packing up.
Why?

464
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,992
We return.

465
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:11,912
Tell me about the road.

466
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:17,274
Just a lot of hard work, that's all.

467
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:24,509
Are you are you and Marty argued.
It seems as if the Ijut.

468
01:03:25,640 --> 01:03:29,679
No, I think it is probably only
nervous about the match. That's all.

469
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:33,108
I'm nervous.
Yes I am.

470
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:45,552
Be patient. Not attacked too.
Keep away from his reach. Now try to knockout.

471
01:03:45,720 --> 01:03:51,716
Wait it. It will not be able to compete
with your fitness.

472
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:57,398
Frustriraj it. Be patient.
Stick to the plan. Let it chase you.

473
01:03:57,560 --> 01:04:03,669
If you the opportunity, go,
but do not force anything and do not spuštaj right hand.

474
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:08,630
If you get to the seventh round,
izmoriš his feet, it's yours.

475
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:17,637
It's okay, Marty. I do not want to
too relaxed.

476
01:04:23,320 --> 01:04:26,676
All right?
Yeah, right.

477
01:04:29,160 --> 01:04:31,833
Ladies, time to go.

478
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:41,355
Hey, ladies sticking out.

479
01:04:42,040 --> 01:04:47,398
Can you kiss, for luck?
It's probably a bad idea.

480
01:04:49,640 --> 01:04:54,350
Well, break it.

481
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:02,148
It is time to go, champ.

482
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:08,077
How do you feel?

483
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:13,155
Ok, Tommy. Focus.
Breathe.

484
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,835
Please fix it.

485
01:07:17,560 --> 01:07:23,829
Stick to our plan.
Persistent zavlaci me. - Screw it.

486
01:07:24,000 --> 01:07:28,915
Do not play with him, it's too dangerous.
Do not give him that came out.

487
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:34,791
Just moving. - You have a hook.
Frustriraj it. Natjeraj him to the chase. Let izmori.

488
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:44,073
Stick to the plan.
Focus. Well you go.

489
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:47,518
Come on, Kane! We worked hard for this.

490
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:30,510
All right, Tommy.
Perfect boksuješ.

491
01:08:30,840 --> 01:08:36,437
Want to pobjediš match, Kane?
You have to nokautiraš.

492
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:41,869
You brought it to where we wanted. Now is our turn.
This is the seventh, just as we planned.

493
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:48,354
You want me to fight against Norris? Will you?
Man is constantly moving. - Screw it. They are moving with him. Nokautiraj it!

494
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:51,358
Listen.

495
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:56,514
Krode left him tied with the right shoulder.
Shoulder down before krošea.

496
01:08:56,680 --> 01:09:02,277
As soon as the shoulder down,
hook coming.

497
01:09:03,840 --> 01:09:09,073
Victory means the cash, baby.
This is our reward. You can do it.

498
01:09:11,760 --> 01:09:16,038
Just as planned. The seventh round.
Let's do it now.

499
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:21,959
Entering inside.

500
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:26,834
We need the hospital. I want to get inside secure.
The guy can odaditi ten rounds tonight.

501
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:32,632
All is well. Good you were there.
Thank you. Thanks to this man here.

502
01:11:35,080 --> 01:11:41,349
I booked us a dinner celebration at Taylor
tonight. - No way. I have always wanted to go there.

503
01:11:41,520 --> 01:11:45,991
I know. Well, you deserved it.
We have earned.

504
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:50,517
Bob Silver. We definitely succeeded.

505
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:55,834
It pleased them to your beautiful face.
They want us all out.

506
01:11:55,960 --> 01:12:00,795
His limo is outside.
About a half mile long.

507
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:03,633
That's it! We managed.

508
01:12:05,280 --> 01:12:10,195
We will have a crazy night.
Idemjo Silver-Mobil. All entered?

509
01:12:17,960 --> 01:12:21,589
Marty, what are you doing?

510
01:12:23,080 --> 01:12:29,428
I'm going home to feed Lucy.
Come with us, at least briefly. We won.

511
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:35,237
I am proud of you.
Proud of us.

512
01:12:37,240 --> 01:12:41,597
Come with us.
Some other time perhaps.

513
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:46,754
You're had your plans. I'm sorry.
I'm lost in this. - It's okay.

514
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:51,948
We will do it some other time. You may save a few hundred dollars. - Are you sure. View this fucking
limo. I got my limo. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. Absolutely. Go. It's nice to Spend.

515
01:13:03,040 --> 01:13:06,794
Tommy...
Come on, you two. All waiting.

516
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:14,029
Tonight, you become a boxer.
No one can stop now.

517
01:13:14,200 --> 01:13:18,990
None. But you alone.
Do not forget that.

518
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:29,594
Everybody loves a winner.

519
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:32,718
Voljece and me, right?

520
01:13:42,080 --> 01:13:47,757
Marty does not go with us?
Lucy has to feed.

521
01:14:21,680 --> 01:14:25,275
What have you done now?

522
01:14:30,480 --> 01:14:35,031
Marty, go home...

523
01:14:37,600 --> 01:14:40,353
feed the dog.

524
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:27,629
Bob said najnevjerovatnije things about you.

525
01:15:30,280 --> 01:15:34,717
Maybe you'll get a chance to fight for the title.

526
01:15:34,880 --> 01:15:38,839
Diane recently to push through the one your cigars.

527
01:15:44,000 --> 01:15:46,639
Come here.

528
01:16:11,440 --> 01:16:15,433
All is well.
He's asleep now.

529
01:16:16,160 --> 01:16:21,029
Why did this?
Thus shall these things.

530
01:16:26,040 --> 01:16:31,068
Is this because of what is
happened in the hut?

531
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:34,312
What happened in the hut?

532
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:42,475
He told me.
What?

533
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,717
Come on, Diana, I know.

534
01:16:55,280 --> 01:17:00,274
When I was a boxer, a bastard
threatened to expose him,

535
01:17:00,440 --> 01:17:03,989
because he put his hand window.

536
01:17:04,160 --> 01:17:08,915
Then he graduated
and began to teach.

537
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:15,715
So we are upozali.
I was pulled because of it.

538
01:17:18,680 --> 01:17:25,677
This job is a way to be seized
to bring him back to his feet.

539
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:31,395
Did you gave a speech about Moby Dick?

540
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:36,998
Yes. And you?
I do not think there is a person you know, and that it was not heard.

541
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,599
You have to love it.

542
01:18:51,080 --> 01:18:54,675
Are you okay?
Good.

543
01:18:54,840 --> 01:18:59,994
Check this out. I brought your pills, juice,

544
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:05,513
low fat ice cream.
Creepy said.

545
01:19:05,800 --> 01:19:09,679
I know, but it is good for you.
And soy milk.

546
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,798
Soy milk?

547
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:20,998
Tommy, I'm sorry for all this.
Why?

548
01:19:23,680 --> 01:19:29,550
We have a job. I can not afford
to be more zezaš.

549
01:19:29,720 --> 01:19:34,191
We will put it in the kitchen.
I thought I was sleeping on the couch.

550
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:39,912
You do not have.
If you need something, I'll be there.

551
01:19:42,080 --> 01:19:45,755
Ok. You do not have. Thank you.

552
01:19:46,240 --> 01:19:50,358
Like you said:
"Just hit".

553
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:54,078
Jab. One, two.

554
01:19:55,280 --> 01:19:58,431
Rotate. They move around with a bag.

555
01:20:03,240 --> 01:20:08,553
Bag is your opponent. I tell you that you gain by going.
Smart.

556
01:20:08,800 --> 01:20:13,590
Rotate. One, two...

557
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:19,829
You know what? Not bad for an old man.

558
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:23,470
Will a little water?
Yes, thank you.

559
01:20:27,640 --> 01:20:32,668
I learned that everything we know, but not everything I know.
Is that right? Let's check.

560
01:20:32,840 --> 01:20:35,434
Funny.

561
01:20:37,080 --> 01:20:41,756
Good look. Not bad for a
old man, huh? The news of Silver.

562
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:46,277
Willing to give Tommyju
match with Norris for the title.

563
01:20:46,560 --> 01:20:49,916
He wants to arrange a meeting immediately.

564
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:56,518
Contracts that. May at any time.
They want to be found with Tommyjem alone.

565
01:20:56,680 --> 01:21:00,719
Why?
It will.

566
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:05,713
No, I told you, any other
Wednesday we do not like.

567
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:11,278
We will do this together. Only
question coordinate plans.

568
01:21:14,360 --> 01:21:16,954
Tomorrow? No, I can then, great.

569
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:22,990
Doleticu later. Yes, so I have enough
time for all the crap before we go out.

570
01:21:26,000 --> 01:21:31,472
So, call Jennifer.
It takes a book.

571
01:21:34,120 --> 01:21:39,114
Yes, I see you. Dock wallet.

572
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:43,956
Tommy, it's good to see you again.
Great game from the night.

573
01:21:44,200 --> 01:21:49,069
Tommy, I will not pricatii nonsense.
You're a championship-caliber boxer.

574
01:21:49,240 --> 01:21:53,233
I want to be in the business Tommyja Riley.
Here's how we will.

575
01:21:53,400 --> 01:21:57,916
Sign an exclusive contract with me and my
center for training, three games guaranteed

576
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:02,039
permission to go to the title
one million dollars.

577
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:06,869
How do you like it?

578
01:22:07,040 --> 01:22:12,512
I will arrange the purchase of your current manager,
and you tell me how much time you need to clean up.

579
01:22:12,680 --> 01:22:15,319
I think I do not understand.

580
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:19,632
Shopping? I can not leave Martyja.

581
01:22:21,400 --> 01:22:26,758
Ok, I understand loyalty.
In fact, I respect it.

582
01:22:26,920 --> 01:22:31,630
I mean, sitting here in part because of him.
Absolutely.

583
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:36,838
To gain by going to a completely new stratosphere
I take great risk.

584
01:22:37,000 --> 01:22:41,869
I need to know that you're surrounded by people who know how
to take care of you. Real people, my people.

585
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:46,670
You will not be a boxer in the backyard.

586
01:22:46,840 --> 01:22:51,789
I control the three titles, four
first-class competitors.

587
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:56,431
Ask any of them that brought them there,
they will tell me. They have come through this office.

588
01:22:56,600 --> 01:22:59,956
Marty and Diane did a great job.

589
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:05,274
Have agreed to make educational games
opponents that made me look great.

590
01:23:05,520 --> 01:23:08,193
They played very well and
you see where it led.

591
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:14,151
I can not leave Martyja.
Is there any way to continue to train me?

592
01:23:14,360 --> 01:23:19,798
Tommy, what you need to know is that
Marty in this business has some sort of stain.

593
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:25,996
I am not interested in private Necin
lives until they begin to affect business.

594
01:23:26,160 --> 01:23:32,429
The fact is that coach Marty devilish good, but fucked
by Siles, it can be done to you. Plain and simple.

595
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:39,634
Marty is a great guy. Arrange
to be well taken care of.

596
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:47,952
Only talk about the element
for whom boxing would never be ready.

597
01:23:48,560 --> 01:23:52,473
Will never be ready for it.

598
01:23:55,880 --> 01:23:59,953
I smao not...
Think about it. That's my offer.

599
01:24:00,960 --> 01:24:05,875
Can you believe? Just me
care who he is. I will not do.

600
01:24:06,040 --> 01:24:11,990
These things may be the only opportunity that you get.
Ugojicu ten pounds and fight against Varelle.

601
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:16,312
Silver does not have it. - I do not know either
whether you accept it. You do not have enough matches.

602
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:21,759
You spent two years preparing for anything.
You guys are all in the same bed.

603
01:24:21,920 --> 01:24:26,710
Tommy, think.
Prespavaj it. All of us will.

604
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:31,995
I moved into a new apartment, I went...

605
01:24:32,160 --> 01:24:37,917
Wait a minute. What kind of crap on educational games?
It's nothing, just a story, do not worry about it. Shit. What is thought?

606
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:43,757
Only say what it is. As we brought you this far.
We agreed with opponents who matches made me look good

607
01:24:43,920 --> 01:24:48,277
Manještaljke? - Of course not. - Marty,
honestly I got those games, right? Absolutely.

608
01:24:48,440 --> 01:24:50,670
Absolutely.

609
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:55,994
You were great. now you fucking greatest promoter in the business
wants you to pay a million dollars to fight for the title.

610
01:24:56,120 --> 01:25:02,912
You must be delighted.
I do not want to do it. No, do not fight without Martyja and that's it.

611
01:25:03,120 --> 01:25:09,559
Technically, it's not your decision.
What does it mean? - The contract was our decision.

612
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:13,273
He's right.

613
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:22,554
Do not fight it without you and hurt me what it says in those
contracts. - Not to me it does not matter what the contracts. - What then one story?

614
01:25:23,000 --> 01:25:29,030
Listen to me for a moment. We will not sell you,
understand? Why do this? You know that.

615
01:25:29,200 --> 01:25:34,149
I appreciate that you're doing, it's a venerable thing,
but I really want to accept the match.

616
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:40,316
I do not want to miss environmental opportunity. I considered that
took him as far as I could. Okay?

617
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:46,950
Silver can give you what you want. Can you give large
boxers. It will give you what you need and so you have less interference.

618
01:25:47,160 --> 01:25:52,234
I told you I do not care for it. We completely understand.

619
01:25:53,280 --> 01:25:57,558
If I go there without you,
then I am going.

620
01:25:59,040 --> 01:26:06,754
Sam. All the things you said, "We're a team, boxing
is a team sport. There will never be alone "

621
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:10,555
Do to it. I assume that you thought, huh?

622
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:16,750
Tommy, what I did in the ring with you,
does not mean that I'm not with you.

623
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:21,630
Accept the offer.
Do not leave you.

624
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:26,590
I'm not a fucking Silas.
Do not fight it without you.

625
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:30,952
See you tomorrow in the hall, right?

626
01:26:42,880 --> 01:26:48,830
Have you seen those contracts
with Martyjem and Diana?

627
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:54,279
I can not find them.
Why did not you said to offer?

628
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:59,639
Why did not you said to offer?
I will not be accepted.

629
01:26:59,800 --> 01:27:04,669
Marty says that if you do not accept this offer, you may
you will never have the chance to fight for the title.

630
01:27:04,840 --> 01:27:08,469
Is it possible that it does not want?
Damn!

631
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:14,548
So you worked hard for this. Do
Do not how much you were unhappy?.

632
01:27:14,720 --> 01:27:20,670
You know what I want. I want to boksujem more than any
nothing. I have to find the fucking papers.

633
01:27:20,840 --> 01:27:26,870
Help me understand, ok? I am here for you, but if we
do not talk about these things, which we then anyway?

634
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:34,189
What is so afraid of?
Nothing!

635
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:38,558
I will not do. I will not accept the fucking offer.
Leave me alone!

636
01:27:43,080 --> 01:27:45,469
Hi, guys.

637
01:27:46,720 --> 01:27:51,555
How are you?
Good. This is Alex.

638
01:27:51,720 --> 01:27:56,555
Tommy, this is Alex and Victor.
Will work with us. Put the bag there.

639
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:03,310
Marty? We work here.
Just to make sure these guys first.

640
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:14,710
Let's go one-two combination
three minutes.

641
01:28:16,000 --> 01:28:20,994
Well you go.

642
01:28:26,680 --> 01:28:28,830
Let's go one-two again.

643
01:28:29,960 --> 01:28:32,758
Not a bad short direct.

644
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,753
Continue.
It's good, very good.

645
01:28:42,520 --> 01:28:44,715
Three-two-three.

646
01:28:48,480 --> 01:28:51,233
Come again. Be not sloppy.

647
01:28:53,000 --> 01:28:57,312
Lord, did I also learned that, huh?
Come on.

648
01:28:58,440 --> 01:29:02,831
Lord, boksuješ like my dead grandmother.

649
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:08,870
What do you think will happen? Be like hitting the
match with Norris, you think you have a chance?

650
01:29:09,040 --> 01:29:11,998
I do not believe. Come on. Cheer up!

651
01:29:16,160 --> 01:29:20,676
Small lessons. Cheer up.

652
01:29:24,440 --> 01:29:30,231
Cheer up, you understand?
Wake up, Tommy.

653
01:29:33,600 --> 01:29:38,993
You can move the old man. Lord.

654
01:29:39,160 --> 01:29:43,790
Hit, or you can zabušavaš?
What you talking about?

655
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:51,957
What is it? You're a slacker, Tommy. That's what you are.

656
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:57,112
Come on, guys. Come on, damn it.
What do you do?

657
01:30:04,880 --> 01:30:10,750
Razbucacu you to fucking fat ass.
I'll kill you. You hear me? I'll fucking kill you.

658
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:23,196
Marty?
Marty, opened the door, please.

659
01:31:28,520 --> 01:31:30,875
Open the door, Marty!

660
01:31:37,840 --> 01:31:41,150
Dotrcao I am here.

661
01:31:42,920 --> 01:31:46,742
What do you want?
I think we have nothing more to say to each other, Tommy.

662
01:31:47,825 --> 01:31:50,278
I think everything was very clear last time you were here.

663
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:58,590
I have no more that what you learn. I think the
time to both go their own way.

664
01:31:58,760 --> 01:32:02,514
Yet I was not too late to call Silver.

665
01:32:02,680 --> 01:32:07,834
I know what you're trying to do.
You will not succeed.

666
01:32:08,200 --> 01:32:13,877
What I said, I apologize.
I did not mean, sorry.

667
01:32:17,560 --> 01:32:22,588
Marty, can we, please, to
get back to how it was before?

668
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:26,275
No. I'm sorry.
For it is too late.

669
01:32:37,760 --> 01:32:39,751
All right.

670
01:32:45,920 --> 01:32:50,630
I'll give you anything you want.
Whatever you want.

671
01:32:52,560 --> 01:32:56,678
What? What did you say?

672
01:33:02,480 --> 01:33:06,075
I'll give you anything you want.
To think about me? After his time that I gave.

673
01:33:06,240 --> 01:33:09,869
Sorry...
Get out of my house.

674
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:16,393
Marty, opened the door, please.
I did not mean that.

675
01:33:26,600 --> 01:33:28,591
Please.

676
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:50,279
O Lord my God!

677
01:33:56,760 --> 01:34:01,709
Why in life, once I was happy?

678
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:04,952
One way?
One! Lord.

679
01:34:17,480 --> 01:34:21,109
Tommy...

680
01:35:18,480 --> 01:35:21,517
Oh, my God. Marty!

681
01:36:29,840 --> 01:36:34,277
Hello. Stephanie said.
Leave a message. Thank you.

682
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:36,715
Hi, Steph. I am.

683
01:36:39,200 --> 01:36:44,558
I called just to tell you that I'm sorry.

684
01:36:49,280 --> 01:36:53,398
I'm sorry I clamored.
I'm sorry for everything.

685
01:36:58,440 --> 01:37:01,876

686
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:13,594
I'm sorry.
And I just wanted to know.

687
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:05,188

688
01:40:51,200 --> 01:40:54,112

689
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:57,394
Wait...

690
01:41:11,800 --> 01:41:14,997
