I will be father! Has just spoken
with my wife! My son will be born!

5
00:01:14,328 --> 00:01:17,632
- I have, leave the road!

6
00:01:17,978 --> 00:01:19,745
Congratulations!

7
00:01:23,704 --> 00:01:25,241
Good luck, Herb!

8
00:01:25,586 --> 00:01:27,046
Nor think about that!

9
00:01:30,889 --> 00:01:34,270
- Excuse. I will be father!
- Congratulations!

10
00:01:35,923 --> 00:01:38,651
I have, Mr. Metz!
Did he/she already hear the good ones new?

11
00:01:38,882 --> 00:01:40,457
That beautiful day!

12
00:01:42,379 --> 00:01:43,839
I arrived!

13
00:01:44,185 --> 00:01:47,259
- I arrived!
- Dear, I feel a lot.

14
00:01:47,490 --> 00:01:49,757
You lost the delivery.

15
00:01:50,372 --> 00:01:53,984
But everything well, the more
entertaining it is to set up the baby!

16
00:02:01,169 --> 00:02:04,627
Robots

17
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:19,114
- Dear, I think he/she caught the wrong screw...
- I don't need the manual.

18
00:02:32,718 --> 00:02:35,907
Push! Push!

19
00:02:49,395 --> 00:02:53,890
A work of 12 hours.
Will it be that it was worth to the feather?

20
00:02:54,044 --> 00:02:56,080
Only look for him!

21
00:02:56,273 --> 00:03:01,037
Rodney Copperbottom! He/she has the eyes
of his/her mother and my father's nose.

22
00:03:01,153 --> 00:03:03,074
It was good to have kept
those parts!

23
00:03:03,343 --> 00:03:06,762
I feel that he will accomplish big
done for the world!

24
00:03:07,071 --> 00:03:09,645
Dear, what does that break is?

25
00:03:10,491 --> 00:03:14,295
They always put one
he/she leaves extra.

26
00:03:14,679 --> 00:03:16,485
Did we want a boy, right?

27
00:03:19,021 --> 00:03:21,211
He/she won't hurt anything, son.

28
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:31,471
It is his/her narizinho.
It is yours...

29
00:03:52,721 --> 00:03:54,719
- Hello, son!
- Will I win new parts?

30
00:03:54,873 --> 00:03:56,256
He/she goes yes!

31
00:03:59,523 --> 00:04:04,710
- But they are not brilliant...
- Well, they are used...

32
00:04:04,826 --> 00:04:08,361
They were given by the
my cousin Jeffrey.

33
00:04:08,553 --> 00:04:10,435
And they are alone for that year.

34
00:04:36,028 --> 00:04:39,947
- Father, who is that?
- That is Bigweld.

35
00:04:40,101 --> 00:04:42,252
The largest robot of the world.

36
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:44,904
I thought you went
the largest robot of the world!

37
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,862
Besides me!
He is owner of the industries Bigweld.

38
00:04:49,016 --> 00:04:51,859
He invents things that
they improve the life of all.

39
00:04:52,206 --> 00:04:54,934
- Can I know him/it?
- Clear. Who knows one day?

40
00:04:55,164 --> 00:04:59,890
- Father, what do you make?
- I work at a chic restaurant.

41
00:05:00,583 --> 00:05:02,004
I am lava-plates!

42
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,264
Live of Robot City,
the show of Bigweld.

43
00:05:14,877 --> 00:05:17,144
He/she walks, father! He/she is losing.

44
00:05:17,413 --> 00:05:20,410
I am going, Rodney!

45
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:24,944
I had to bring work home.
Mr. Gunk is collecting me.

46
00:05:25,675 --> 00:05:29,133
He/she is now his/her presenter, Bigweld!

47
00:05:29,326 --> 00:05:33,245
Welcome! I thought you/they would like
of giving a walk in the industries Bigweld.

48
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:36,396
There it is the main gate.
And it is very nice!

49
00:05:38,971 --> 00:05:42,275
- Good morning, Tim!
- Good morning, Mr. Bigweld.

50
00:05:42,506 --> 00:05:44,773
Tim, who did the main gate close?

51
00:05:45,004 --> 00:05:49,884
- I thought...
- We never closed the main gate!

52
00:05:50,076 --> 00:05:52,919
It would be the same as
to end with our ideas!

53
00:05:53,112 --> 00:05:57,031
Everyday robots come here
to show their new ideas!

54
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:01,603
I listen all of them.

55
00:06:06,945 --> 00:06:11,517
And remember. You don't care
it is done of surpluses or of new parts.

56
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:14,515
You can shine, it doesn't matter
of what it is done.

57
00:06:14,746 --> 00:06:16,552
He is speaking to me, father.

58
00:06:16,744 --> 00:06:19,088
With certainty, son.

59
00:06:19,895 --> 00:06:23,084
Certain, personal.
We will invent!

60
00:06:27,119 --> 00:06:32,806
But all of the inventions that exist
they were born of a good idea!

61
00:06:35,996 --> 00:06:40,953
Then seek a need and begin
to have ideas for us to supply such need.

62
00:06:41,106 --> 00:06:44,410
An idea takes the other and
before you notice...

63
00:06:46,371 --> 00:06:50,213
you got!
Discover the need and put an end to her!

64
00:06:50,367 --> 00:06:52,711
It is that, father! I have to seek...

65
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:57,898
a need.

66
00:07:10,656 --> 00:07:11,770
He/she calms there...

67
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:27,871
Hello, boy!

68
00:07:29,139 --> 00:07:31,636
Here they are their 12 year-old parts.

69
00:07:31,791 --> 00:07:33,251
- They are...
- Second-hand.

70
00:07:33,558 --> 00:07:35,825
I know, father.
But I don't call.

71
00:07:36,517 --> 00:07:39,130
They Belong to his/her cousin Veronica.

72
00:07:39,899 --> 00:07:43,049
You know that her
it is quite popular!

73
00:08:23,321 --> 00:08:27,932
As soon as his/her warranty ends,
you begin to fall to the pieces.

74
00:08:28,278 --> 00:08:31,582
- Soon I will be covered with adhesive ribbon.
- Try again, father.

75
00:08:31,775 --> 00:08:36,117
Rodney, you ended
with all of the problems of that?

76
00:08:36,232 --> 00:08:38,038
We go there! That goes
to facilitate his/her work.

77
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,498
I invented for you.

78
00:08:43,187 --> 00:08:46,645
- Certain, we will try.
- Great! It is now.

79
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:50,218
Robot-fantastic, to the work!

80
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:46,475
- Copperbottom!
- Mr. Gunk!

81
00:09:46,591 --> 00:09:48,973
- The one what is this?
- My son invented.

82
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:52,316
- The one what is making?
- Mr. Gunk, you scared him.

83
00:09:54,084 --> 00:09:55,582
He/she is destroying my kitchen!

84
00:09:57,312 --> 00:09:59,540
- I will stop him/it.
- Not!

85
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:06,842
- Was his/her son?
- My father didn't have to do anything with that.

86
00:10:07,034 --> 00:10:09,570
He is a brilliant boy
and it invented that.

87
00:10:09,724 --> 00:10:11,760
Clean that mess!

88
00:10:11,991 --> 00:10:14,796
And you leave of here, inventor.

89
00:10:14,911 --> 00:10:18,484
You will never be anything besides the
son of a washer of plates.

90
00:10:18,754 --> 00:10:22,827
Somebody removes that oil of me.
He/she will frighten the customers.

91
00:10:23,557 --> 00:10:26,823
- Round trip?
- Only departure.

92
00:10:29,744 --> 00:10:31,703
There it is you!

93
00:10:31,857 --> 00:10:33,701
I told you that he/she would find him/it.

94
00:10:34,086 --> 00:10:35,546
It is the maternal instinct.

95
00:10:35,585 --> 00:10:40,042
He left a ticket saying
that it left of train!

96
00:10:40,157 --> 00:10:42,808
He/she leaves for there. Catch his/her suitcase,
he/she will go back home now.

97
00:10:42,962 --> 00:10:45,113
No, mother. I need to do that.

98
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:50,071
I am going to Robot City to arrange a job
and to help the father to pay Mr. Gunk.

99
00:10:50,187 --> 00:10:53,068
Speak to him.
Robot City?

100
00:10:53,222 --> 00:10:56,219
- You are just a boy!
- I will never be somebody here.

101
00:10:56,335 --> 00:10:59,370
I want to be an inventor
as Bigweld.

102
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:00,907
I want to be somebody!

103
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,827
You are somebody. Somebody that
he/she won't arise in that train.

104
00:11:04,904 --> 00:11:07,401
- I go yes.
- Speak to him.

105
00:11:11,475 --> 00:11:13,780
- A passage for Robot City.
- Where what does think goes?

106
00:11:13,934 --> 00:11:15,471
Who goes is him.

107
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:21,696
- But...
- Rodney, I wanted to be musician in his/her age.

108
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:27,537
I played well, but my father
it thought it would not be future.

109
00:11:27,652 --> 00:11:31,302
Then I ended up being a washer of plates.
I am not complaining.

110
00:11:31,457 --> 00:11:34,262
But I always said for me same...

111
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:39,257
if I could choose again,
he/she would follow my heart.

112
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,446
You are big, Rodney.

113
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,175
Never doubt.

114
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:48,249
Go to Robot City,
find Bigweld

115
00:11:48,364 --> 00:11:50,477
and show him their great ideas.

116
00:11:50,824 --> 00:11:55,127
And Rodney, never give up.

117
00:12:11,459 --> 00:12:13,418
All the on board.

118
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:18,106
Mother...

119
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:31,825
I won't disappoint him/it, father.

120
00:12:32,171 --> 00:12:34,015
You will be proud of me!

121
00:12:36,935 --> 00:12:39,125
I know that yes.

122
00:13:28,427 --> 00:13:29,848
With license, it was able to...

123
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:33,729
He/she can tell me where they are
the industries Bigweld?

124
00:13:33,922 --> 00:13:37,687
- Perfect! They are 50 silvers.
- 50 silvers? For the the something?

125
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:39,723
For a beautiful picture of his/her first
moment in Robot City!

126
00:13:39,801 --> 00:13:42,682
Now it is his/her second moment.
They are more 50 dollars.

127
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:43,989
Is he/she writing down?

128
00:13:45,027 --> 00:13:48,177
Help me here! More presence, less pose.

129
00:13:48,332 --> 00:13:50,983
Inside of you he/she has a model
ready to leave.

130
00:13:51,214 --> 00:13:54,326
Feel big eyes,
same to the of Japanese drawing.

131
00:13:56,094 --> 00:13:58,937
- I am adoring!
- I don't want pictures.

132
00:13:59,091 --> 00:14:00,435
- Doesn't he/she want?
- Not!

133
00:14:00,590 --> 00:14:04,009
Everything well, the camera is without film.
Does he/she want a map with the houses of the famous ones?

134
00:14:04,202 --> 00:14:05,393
Where him?

135
00:14:16,268 --> 00:14:18,535
I am "with a free screw"

136
00:14:24,068 --> 00:14:25,874
Does he/she want to buy a clock?

137
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,949
Don't buy us, we are falsified.

138
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,371
Close.

139
00:14:38,939 --> 00:14:41,782
With license, as I do for
to arrive in the industries Bigweld?

140
00:14:46,702 --> 00:14:48,162
He/she leaves for there.

141
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:03,186
With license, as I do for
to arrive in the industries Bigweld?

142
00:15:06,645 --> 00:15:07,298
How?

143
00:15:10,526 --> 00:15:12,831
Ta, thank you.

144
00:15:13,101 --> 00:15:18,672
The express that it crosses the city with
I destine to the industries Bigweld is leaving.

145
00:15:18,865 --> 00:15:27,011
Children cannot travel alone.
It is advisable to hold their movable parts.

146
00:15:27,587 --> 00:15:29,508
Forced to all and a good morning.

147
00:15:50,028 --> 00:15:52,179
What...?
Do I have, are you following myself?

148
00:15:52,372 --> 00:15:53,294
No.

149
00:15:53,448 --> 00:15:55,369
First time in the express?

150
00:15:55,523 --> 00:15:57,444
- Actually me...
- Gee!

151
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:01,326
Good luck in the big city. If he/she does
success here, will do anywhere.

152
00:16:01,441 --> 00:16:04,169
If it doesn't get,
welcome to the club.

153
00:16:13,123 --> 00:16:15,005
- Oh, not!
- What was the one?

154
00:16:15,121 --> 00:16:17,465
- We left the rail! We will fall!
- The one what?

155
00:16:29,185 --> 00:16:30,683
I was playing.

156
00:16:31,222 --> 00:16:32,682
Put the hands among the legs.

157
00:16:45,555 --> 00:16:46,707
There he/she is leaving my point.

158
00:17:05,421 --> 00:17:08,687
My parts are falling.
That shame.

159
00:17:27,555 --> 00:17:28,669
Excuse.

160
00:17:41,773 --> 00:17:44,693
It was very worse, he/she had
a gigantic hammer.

161
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:46,921
He/she still has!

162
00:18:09,593 --> 00:18:11,821
Be with me, boy. I know the
city as the palm of my hand.

163
00:18:12,014 --> 00:18:13,128
I have, that is new.

164
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:34,877
"You can shine, it doesn't matter
of what it is done."

165
00:18:35,301 --> 00:18:37,376
With license, can I help him/it?

166
00:18:37,568 --> 00:18:40,181
Excuse, me... I have!

167
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:44,216
- You are Tim of the program of TV!
- I am me!

168
00:18:44,408 --> 00:18:47,597
Hello, Tim. Who did the gate close?

169
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:50,094
- Him never clamor...
- The one what you want?

170
00:18:51,209 --> 00:18:53,745
I would like to see Mr. Bigweld.

171
00:18:53,938 --> 00:18:56,358
I am an inventor.

172
00:18:57,742 --> 00:19:01,699
Why didn't say soon he/she?
Wait there.

173
00:19:19,568 --> 00:19:20,567
Thank you!

174
00:19:23,219 --> 00:19:26,600
I caught you! You were
all lively and there "bum!"

175
00:19:27,945 --> 00:19:30,096
Certain, I already had fun.
He/she can enter.

176
00:19:36,168 --> 00:19:38,089
That is very funny!

177
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:43,315
It was the second time.
He/she thought I will let to enter him.

178
00:19:44,238 --> 00:19:45,352
But I don't go.

179
00:19:45,583 --> 00:19:48,157
Excuse boy, but
they are rules of the company.

180
00:19:48,273 --> 00:19:51,270
Like them they will negotiate
new inventors like this?

181
00:19:51,424 --> 00:19:53,575
Don't go!
That is thing of the past.

182
00:19:53,729 --> 00:19:57,264
Return two years ago and
maybe get a job!

183
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:15,439
And remember. You don't care
it is done of surpluses or of new parts.

184
00:20:15,632 --> 00:20:18,552
You can shine, it doesn't matter
of what it is done.

185
00:20:18,745 --> 00:20:22,510
Mine ours. That delegated extraordinary.

186
00:20:23,049 --> 00:20:25,469
Concern with the common robot.

187
00:20:25,662 --> 00:20:29,197
They are not more values like this.

188
00:20:29,350 --> 00:20:31,386
And for a good reason.

189
00:20:31,502 --> 00:20:33,730
That doesn't give money!

190
00:20:33,885 --> 00:20:37,228
Wake up! We are not one
charity company!

191
00:20:37,420 --> 00:20:40,378
It is for that that Bigweld no
he/she sits down more in that chair.

192
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:42,261
It is a relic!

193
00:20:42,415 --> 00:20:46,065
I don't want more to hear
"please, Bigweld... "

194
00:20:48,487 --> 00:20:52,099
We can say next month,
in the party of Bigweld!

195
00:20:55,019 --> 00:21:00,052
Now we will suck all the
the common robots' cents.

196
00:21:01,321 --> 00:21:03,434
What do the more robots want?

197
00:21:10,044 --> 00:21:13,617
Improvements, personal!
It is like this that we will make money.

198
00:21:13,771 --> 00:21:18,535
We were always telling the robots that not
he/she matters of what are done.

199
00:21:18,767 --> 00:21:24,607
Like this they won't feel rusty
and they won't buy our improvements.

200
00:21:24,838 --> 00:21:28,181
Therefore I invented a new slogan.

201
00:21:28,374 --> 00:21:31,448
"Why you to be when
can you be new? "

202
00:21:34,829 --> 00:21:42,360
I found diamond, but I want
the employees' opinion.

203
00:21:42,553 --> 00:21:46,472
Very good, boss Ratchet!

204
00:21:52,083 --> 00:21:53,850
Don't look down.

205
00:22:04,725 --> 00:22:06,607
I have, he/she leaves!

206
00:22:06,877 --> 00:22:08,221
Shoo!

207
00:22:08,606 --> 00:22:10,488
Leave! Shoo!

208
00:22:12,410 --> 00:22:14,100
Leave from me!

209
00:22:14,255 --> 00:22:19,327
- Cappy, you didn't say anything.
- He/she gave me chills.

210
00:22:19,442 --> 00:22:21,248
- Thank you.
- But...

211
00:22:21,402 --> 00:22:22,477
But?

212
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:26,935
Why would the robots buy improvements

213
00:22:27,089 --> 00:22:29,471
if the parts are a lot
more cockroaches?

214
00:22:29,625 --> 00:22:36,657
It is easy. Starting from today not
we will manufacture more parts!

215
00:22:36,811 --> 00:22:39,616
He/she knows what call robots that
cannot they buy improvements?

216
00:22:39,808 --> 00:22:44,611
Junk-dealer! You see them in the streets,
full of rust,

217
00:22:44,765 --> 00:22:48,838
Them nor they are scrubbed!

218
00:22:48,992 --> 00:22:51,758
Cappy, want his/her department
working in the new slogan.

219
00:22:51,951 --> 00:22:54,679
I will transfer her/it for one
room beside mine.

220
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:59,290
We will work juntinhos in that.
Won't it be entertaining?

221
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:00,750
A lot.

222
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:14,469
- Excuse.
- The one what...?

223
00:23:14,623 --> 00:23:17,312
I am a youth inventor

224
00:23:17,543 --> 00:23:20,578
and my dream was always
to come for Robot City

225
00:23:20,733 --> 00:23:23,307
to show my ideas
for Mr. Bigweld.

226
00:23:23,576 --> 00:23:25,920
That it seems not to be here...

227
00:23:26,112 --> 00:23:30,415
But he left me in the command.

228
00:23:30,608 --> 00:23:33,374
Then let to show me the one that
that can do.

229
00:23:33,567 --> 00:23:35,104
I have a better idea.

230
00:23:35,488 --> 00:23:38,831
I will show you the one that
that can do.

231
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:41,098
He can make that!

232
00:24:01,695 --> 00:24:02,847
How was it?

233
00:24:05,768 --> 00:24:09,111
What devils is he/she having here?

234
00:24:09,265 --> 00:24:13,722
A starchy idiot is
seating in the place of Bigweld!

235
00:24:13,838 --> 00:24:17,757
I like to sit down in the sidewalk.

236
00:24:18,449 --> 00:24:22,061
I will return.
And I will discover what is having!

237
00:24:22,138 --> 00:24:25,442
You do be devoted
to you cause lost!

238
00:24:26,134 --> 00:24:29,976
I already knew dreamer like you.
He/she sneaks out, crazy!

239
00:26:31,789 --> 00:26:33,748
Certain, hour of the rest.

240
00:26:35,708 --> 00:26:39,973
He/she ended, continue working!

241
00:26:42,356 --> 00:26:45,583
- Who comes there?
- Hi, mother!

242
00:26:45,738 --> 00:26:48,312
Hello, dear.
How is it going my boy?

243
00:26:48,428 --> 00:26:50,618
Great! I did exactly
as it ordered!

244
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:54,729
We won't be more extra parts.
In some weeks those losers

245
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:59,609
there of top they will turn junk-dealer.
You can control everything!

246
00:26:59,763 --> 00:27:01,607
That good boy!

247
00:27:01,762 --> 00:27:05,566
And when we end with Bigweld
nobody more it can repair them.

248
00:27:05,681 --> 00:27:09,869
Exactly! Can it explain to me again?

249
00:27:10,023 --> 00:27:13,058
Stupid! All idolize him/it!

250
00:27:13,213 --> 00:27:15,364
And if he decides to return?

251
00:27:15,557 --> 00:27:18,631
Mother, he won't cause
problem from where is.

252
00:27:18,785 --> 00:27:21,782
Of the one what does have fear he/she?
Take courage!

253
00:27:21,936 --> 00:27:24,472
Or does he/she want to finish equal to his/her father?

254
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:26,162
Hi, son. That good to see you.

255
00:27:26,431 --> 00:27:30,350
Imagine that on the contrary
of industries Bigweld

256
00:27:30,466 --> 00:27:32,579
be Indústrias Ratchet.

257
00:27:32,810 --> 00:27:33,962
Continue speaking.

258
00:27:34,117 --> 00:27:40,265
- Ratchet City!
- It seems brilliant.

259
00:27:40,419 --> 00:27:44,453
Without Bigweld we won't have
more difficulties!

260
00:27:44,607 --> 00:27:48,334
- We are going ahead!
- That is my boy!

261
00:27:56,058 --> 00:27:59,093
Is he/she hungry? Does he/she want to eat something?
He/she is thin.

262
00:27:59,209 --> 00:28:01,668
No, mother. I need to go. Good-bye.

263
00:28:01,899 --> 00:28:04,319
- Good-bye, father.
- Even plus, son.

264
00:28:04,435 --> 00:28:06,241
Good luck with yours
malicious plans.

265
00:28:31,372 --> 00:28:32,524
Hello.

266
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:38,173
To think I am
being small is because...

267
00:28:38,366 --> 00:28:39,288
I am leaving out!

268
00:28:39,557 --> 00:28:41,939
Stop there!

269
00:28:42,208 --> 00:28:43,745
You took my foot!

270
00:29:25,976 --> 00:29:27,320
Great.

271
00:29:27,513 --> 00:29:31,624
- Is it happy now?
- Only when it returns me my foot, thief!

272
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,931
I am not thief.

273
00:29:33,085 --> 00:29:36,773
I am just a stranger.

274
00:29:36,966 --> 00:29:39,924
I didn't see that it was his/her foot.

275
00:29:40,079 --> 00:29:42,692
- Let to help me him.
- No, he/she can leave.

276
00:29:42,845 --> 00:29:45,227
I have my pride.
Here!

277
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:48,455
No, wait...
Wait!

278
00:29:48,648 --> 00:29:50,415
No, no...

279
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:56,448
He/she is not fast, not
he/she has anything in the garbage.

280
00:29:56,602 --> 00:29:58,946
I have, Diesel!
I found a vocal part for you.

281
00:30:09,244 --> 00:30:10,435
He/she has other here.

282
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:14,239
Don't render. Feel that.

283
00:30:16,853 --> 00:30:20,003
I never find parts of my size.

284
00:30:22,694 --> 00:30:23,808
What was, boy?

285
00:30:25,499 --> 00:30:27,804
To split, did you lose weight?

286
00:30:28,073 --> 00:30:35,412
Did he/she lose weight? His/her donkey, is the head
of him in a basket! We are ended.

287
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:39,217
Shut up. He/she would give a slap
in you if he/she had hand!

288
00:30:41,407 --> 00:30:43,097
Speaking in the devil, there I come!

289
00:30:43,867 --> 00:30:45,442
Hurt!

290
00:30:45,634 --> 00:30:50,552
Only see! Who would play out
a coffeepot so bonitinho?

291
00:30:51,783 --> 00:30:53,320
Be not afraid.

292
00:30:53,473 --> 00:30:55,701
- I have, that is mine!
- It is him!

293
00:30:55,856 --> 00:31:00,544
It was that guy! I recognize
that face and that foot.

294
00:31:00,697 --> 00:31:02,964
He is there, stupid.

295
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:05,424
He is the thief that
he/she pulled my head.

296
00:31:05,654 --> 00:31:06,998
Does he/she want to pull another piece?

297
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:12,302
He/she thinks can make that
with my brother, you... it is even bonitinho.

298
00:31:12,533 --> 00:31:14,838
Can Piper, behave?

299
00:31:14,992 --> 00:31:17,912
We have to repair Splitting.
Again.

300
00:31:18,258 --> 00:31:19,795
That is yours.

301
00:31:20,257 --> 00:31:24,022
To purpose, I am Piper.
I am fire!

302
00:31:26,289 --> 00:31:27,518
I see you thereabout.

303
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:36,779
We already spoke hundreds of times:
don't "speak with strange."

304
00:31:36,972 --> 00:31:39,123
I speak to you.
Who can stranger be?

305
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,729
I have good and bad news.

306
00:31:49,845 --> 00:31:52,419
- Which is the bad?
- I checked the stock

307
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:55,647
and starting from today they don't manufacture more
parts for you.

308
00:31:55,878 --> 00:31:59,259
- You were discontinued officially.
- Done discontinue?

309
00:31:59,336 --> 00:32:01,603
That good.
And which is the good news?

310
00:32:01,796 --> 00:32:05,869
If we had their parts,
they would be for sale!

311
00:32:11,556 --> 00:32:15,360
How did that go to happen?
I am practically a boy!

312
00:32:15,514 --> 00:32:18,857
Be controlled. You only need
of an improvement.

313
00:32:21,278 --> 00:32:25,581
- The new improvements are too much.
- Has just arrived.

314
00:32:25,697 --> 00:32:27,579
They have door-glasses even.

315
00:32:28,425 --> 00:32:30,653
- Does he/she have size super big?
- Clear!

316
00:32:30,808 --> 00:32:33,920
See the new collection
Spring Bigweld.

317
00:32:36,149 --> 00:32:40,414
I cannot buy that luxury.
I only need a committee for the neck.

318
00:32:40,683 --> 00:32:43,449
Why is that
happening with me?

319
00:32:46,447 --> 00:32:48,137
I am hurting myself.
Stupid!

320
00:32:48,368 --> 00:32:51,980
Excuse, friend.
It is the improvement or undo him/it.

321
00:32:52,134 --> 00:32:54,247
Do undo? No!

322
00:32:54,478 --> 00:32:57,705
I am well.
See, without the hands.

323
00:33:02,048 --> 00:33:05,314
- I am back. Did longings feel?
- Nobody goes for it undoes him/it!

324
00:33:05,507 --> 00:33:08,657
Quite so! But as
does it think we would get in him?

325
00:33:08,811 --> 00:33:11,116
Stop with that!
Listen here.

326
00:33:11,271 --> 00:33:15,728
Find my brother's part.
We are neither garbage nor junk-dealer!

327
00:33:15,843 --> 00:33:17,802
We won't be treated like this.

328
00:33:19,648 --> 00:33:21,838
Lament, I don't have the parts.

329
00:33:22,030 --> 00:33:24,258
But he/she has screws, spray
anti-corrosive and plastic.

330
00:33:24,374 --> 00:33:26,064
I can repair him/it easily.

331
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,790
"The force is powerful in that there."

332
00:33:41,935 --> 00:33:44,010
When it was the last time
what did take oil?

333
00:33:44,125 --> 00:33:46,661
I cannot answer,
my sister is here.

334
00:33:46,815 --> 00:33:50,081
- Stop with that, to Split!
- Be stopped. He/she can make tickles.

335
00:33:50,773 --> 00:33:53,347
We were not presented.
I call to Split.

336
00:33:53,578 --> 00:33:57,151
He/she called me Bumper, but I had
that to change when I came for here.

337
00:33:57,306 --> 00:33:59,957
- My name is Rodney Copperbottom.
- Tell me...

338
00:34:00,303 --> 00:34:04,722
- Why was in the garbage?
- Well, today I tried to see Bigweld...

339
00:34:05,068 --> 00:34:09,294
To meet him, say that we needed
a lot that he returns.

340
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:12,829
- He worried about robots like us.
- I heard to say that he got tired

341
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,636
and he/she abandoned us for
we fall to the pieces.

342
00:34:14,790 --> 00:34:16,557
Well, I think it is ready.

343
00:34:16,711 --> 00:34:20,553
Only see! He repaired my neck!

344
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:22,935
- Sweeping!
- Sweeping?

345
00:34:23,743 --> 00:34:25,625
Hide!

346
00:34:32,389 --> 00:34:35,424
- Which is the problem?
- If you are an obsolete model,

347
00:34:35,578 --> 00:34:37,191
- as Splitting...
- I have!

348
00:34:37,346 --> 00:34:39,805
They sweep you and you
they take for it undoes him/it.

349
00:34:39,959 --> 00:34:44,224
There they melt you and they transform you
in another thing.

350
00:34:44,455 --> 00:34:46,068
He/she wants to say...

351
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:52,831
He/she has an obsolete model
that you won't diffuse!

352
00:35:00,171 --> 00:35:01,323
To split, run!

353
00:35:08,932 --> 00:35:16,348
When the robots are in a rut,
there is no best place than the Tia Nádegas.

354
00:35:17,233 --> 00:35:21,190
I will inform that we are here.
Aunt Buttocks!

355
00:35:21,844 --> 00:35:24,533
- We brought somebody.
- I am at the kitchen.

356
00:35:24,726 --> 00:35:27,223
- is he/she sure that his/her aunt doesn't care?
- Relax, she is not my aunt.

357
00:35:27,416 --> 00:35:30,105
She welcomes robots that
they are... hard.

358
00:35:30,259 --> 00:35:33,179
- Blessed it is.
- And why do call her/it of Tia Nádegas?

359
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:35,023
Because we are not able to
to call her/it of Tia Bunda!

360
00:35:39,366 --> 00:35:41,863
She has the behind one
little big.

361
00:35:42,018 --> 00:35:44,938
Until there everything well, but
when she is with gases...

362
00:35:46,206 --> 00:35:52,046
Forgive me, I am so clumsy...
Hello, who are you, my youth?

363
00:35:52,470 --> 00:35:55,544
I am Rodney Bundão...
No! Rodney Copperbottom!

364
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,003
Copperbottom.

365
00:35:57,158 --> 00:36:00,501
That wonderful name.

366
00:36:04,267 --> 00:36:06,995
- The one with his/her friend what was there?
- He was flipped.

367
00:36:09,339 --> 00:36:11,068
There it is!

368
00:36:11,913 --> 00:36:14,449
Aunt Buttocks, he needs
of a place to be.

369
00:36:14,603 --> 00:36:17,062
Feel home.

370
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:20,712
- Thank you, it is his/her a lot of kindness.
- The pleasure is mine.

371
00:36:20,828 --> 00:36:22,672
Which is his/her need?

372
00:36:22,827 --> 00:36:24,479
I have, he/she spoke equal to Bigweld.

373
00:36:24,671 --> 00:36:27,399
That is that he/she is robot...

374
00:36:30,397 --> 00:36:33,932
It can be at my room.
Don't call the gossips.

375
00:36:39,888 --> 00:36:41,232
He/she forgot a place.

376
00:36:41,925 --> 00:36:44,038
To split, leave my room!

377
00:36:44,307 --> 00:36:47,919
I am out. I am inside.
I am out.

378
00:36:48,226 --> 00:36:50,147
Leave my room!

379
00:36:53,299 --> 00:36:56,257
Face, is the third time that I go
to the bathroom. He/she has something wrong with me.

380
00:36:56,527 --> 00:36:58,409
Excuse.

381
00:36:59,985 --> 00:37:04,480
Here we are. Home sweet home.
What is mine is yours.

382
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:06,978
- It pulls life...
- I diffuse.

383
00:37:07,132 --> 00:37:09,437
Another arm wrestling.

384
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:15,163
Can it separate them? Wait,
my backs are scratching.

385
00:37:39,487 --> 00:37:42,906
I know that it seemed a fart,
but I did with the hand under the arm.

386
00:37:45,290 --> 00:37:48,133
Does he/she know how to do? It is difficult, since
we are of metal.

387
00:37:48,325 --> 00:37:50,976
But it is there that he/she enters the ability.
I am almost there. Listen.

388
00:37:53,590 --> 00:37:54,396
No, wait...

389
00:37:55,665 --> 00:37:58,393
That seemed of old.

390
00:38:00,238 --> 00:38:01,890
I am a little tired.

391
00:38:02,044 --> 00:38:04,772
- Tomorrow we talked.
- Did he/she have a difficult day, it was not?

392
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:12,533
My father should be waiting for mine
connection to count that success I did.

393
00:38:12,688 --> 00:38:17,337
I know that it is not his/her problem. If you
he/she annoys their friends ends without them.

394
00:38:17,491 --> 00:38:22,025
Are you a cookie of the luck?
The friends are for that...

395
00:38:22,410 --> 00:38:25,445
- Do you consider me as friend?
- Clear. Or else what would the one be?

396
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:30,748
A shame, a desperate one...
the list is long.

397
00:38:30,787 --> 00:38:35,359
- We will be with the friend.
- Same tends a difficult day, remember...

398
00:38:35,475 --> 00:38:37,357
Tomorrow it will be same!

399
00:38:37,665 --> 00:38:39,932
My last room friend
did he/she jump of that window, did he/she know?

400
00:38:40,278 --> 00:38:42,737
Do I have, to Split?

401
00:38:45,274 --> 00:38:47,387
It is that there, expensive!

402
00:38:51,998 --> 00:38:54,918
Are you 3 years old?
A man does like this...

403
00:38:55,533 --> 00:38:57,723
You are disgusting!

404
00:38:57,839 --> 00:39:00,259
Besides, it is like this that it is done...

405
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:03,910
Children, only listen...

406
00:39:08,983 --> 00:39:13,094
Aunt Buttocks, we were
doing with the armpits!

407
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:17,590
- Excuse...
- Mrs., please...

408
00:39:17,974 --> 00:39:19,972
I need a doctor.

409
00:39:31,846 --> 00:39:37,417
That will wake up you.
Hot oil of the Tia Nádegas.

410
00:39:38,379 --> 00:39:40,338
Care, is hot!

411
00:39:47,371 --> 00:39:49,023
What will you make today?

412
00:39:50,253 --> 00:39:51,713
- We are already doing.
- And as for you?

413
00:39:51,943 --> 00:39:54,248
Bigweld disappeared and
you are there seating.

414
00:39:54,403 --> 00:39:56,170
I think you already know about that.

415
00:39:56,286 --> 00:39:58,053
I need to discover him/it
that it happened with him.

416
00:39:58,207 --> 00:39:59,705
- Does he/she want a piece of advice?
- Clear.

417
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:01,242
Forget that.

418
00:40:01,396 --> 00:40:04,546
My slogan is been you never
to try, it will never fail."

419
00:40:04,701 --> 00:40:07,890
Crank, the idol of all disappeared
and nobody seems if it matters.

420
00:40:08,044 --> 00:40:10,119
He/she should have a crowd
infuriated outside.

421
00:40:10,273 --> 00:40:11,694
But the one what...?

422
00:40:15,384 --> 00:40:19,956
Diamond, my friend!
Now say should rain money."

423
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:22,915
Say! Say...

424
00:40:24,798 --> 00:40:26,873
Lament, personal. Everything is out of print.

425
00:40:27,027 --> 00:40:29,409
I will only receive improvements of here for front.

426
00:40:29,563 --> 00:40:31,791
But I like me of the way that I am.

427
00:40:31,984 --> 00:40:33,866
We cannot buy improvements!

428
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:37,478
Do I have, what is making? Don't play me!

429
00:40:38,862 --> 00:40:42,089
I have, he/she is that boy that repaired Splitting. He repairs robots!

430
00:40:42,743 --> 00:40:46,470
- It is, he can help them. - You will be famous.

431
00:40:48,123 --> 00:40:51,504
Only the ones that have warranty. He/she leaves for there... all come!

432
00:40:52,427 --> 00:40:55,308
I need parts.

433
00:40:55,462 --> 00:40:58,305
You don't seem so... bad.

434
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:01,341
I have, personal! Extra parts!

435
00:41:01,649 --> 00:41:03,070
Wait there!

436
00:41:03,225 --> 00:41:07,106
- The one what is with you there? - They owed if it feels embarrassed!

437
00:41:07,259 --> 00:41:08,988
Why is with two noses?

438
00:41:09,104 --> 00:41:11,294
One breathes and the other sneezes.

439
00:41:12,255 --> 00:41:12,792
It was badly.

440
00:41:13,254 --> 00:41:14,752
Could he/she take a look in my arm?

441
00:41:14,945 --> 00:41:17,788
- Beautiful handshake.

442
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:21,208
- He/she wanted to get rid of that tire. - I am losing the head!

443
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,206
Back!

444
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:25,511
He also has dreams that won't take place.

445
00:41:26,857 --> 00:41:29,047
"Why you to be same? "

446
00:41:30,776 --> 00:41:33,389
"Discover the need and put an end to her! "

447
00:41:34,119 --> 00:41:35,732
Wait!

448
00:41:36,348 --> 00:41:38,115
Who wants to be repaired?

449
00:42:18,925 --> 00:42:21,192
Thank you, Rodney. You are too much.

450
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:42,671
Rodney! Rodney!

451
00:42:44,171 --> 00:42:45,938
Rodney! Rodney!

452
00:42:51,587 --> 00:42:54,545
I felt never so relaxed.

453
00:42:54,892 --> 00:42:58,235
Could he/she scrub among my shoulder pads?

454
00:43:00,617 --> 00:43:03,422
He/she is too strong. He/she calms there!

455
00:43:04,306 --> 00:43:05,881
Does he/she want to kill me?

456
00:43:06,189 --> 00:43:08,878
Relax, he/she is his/her mother.

457
00:43:09,033 --> 00:43:14,758
- As it arrived here? - For the ventilation, I know that it doesn't like them
to see me.

458
00:43:14,912 --> 00:43:17,678
- The one what you want? - Somebody is repairing them.

459
00:43:17,794 --> 00:43:20,637
- The one what? - Somebody is repairing obsolete models!

460
00:43:20,753 --> 00:43:23,173
- They are laughing at you! - Who?

461
00:43:23,366 --> 00:43:25,402
Is he/she sure that you/they are not "laughing with me?"

462
00:43:25,633 --> 00:43:26,824
I have.

463
00:43:27,516 --> 00:43:31,358
Is it then if a fanatic nut is repairing obsolete? Who does care he/she?

464
00:43:31,474 --> 00:43:37,391
Use the brain that I stole for you. Today it is just a, but and is fashion
seen?

465
00:43:37,584 --> 00:43:41,157
We can repair ourselves, we didn't need improvements! "

466
00:43:41,311 --> 00:43:44,461
We "want Bigweld." He/she knows what will happen with you!

467
00:43:45,423 --> 00:43:49,611
Certain, have calm. We have to discover who is and to stop him/it.

468
00:43:49,765 --> 00:43:52,800
Just not to stop him/it. To squeeze him/it! To destroy him/it!

469
00:43:53,146 --> 00:43:56,988
To purpose, he/she brought a decoration for his/her table.

470
00:44:04,252 --> 00:44:06,211
Does he/she have more anybody waiting?

471
00:44:06,942 --> 00:44:08,094
Let to see me.

472
00:44:09,824 --> 00:44:10,630
Some.

473
00:44:10,784 --> 00:44:13,435
- Some? - For what did the one wait, Rodney?

474
00:44:13,589 --> 00:44:16,701
Bigweld disappeared, the sweepers are to the free,

475
00:44:16,817 --> 00:44:18,930
but there he/she appears Copperbottom!

476
00:44:19,084 --> 00:44:23,541
- I am hysterical only of thinking in that! - I am not Bigweld.

477
00:44:23,734 --> 00:44:26,347
- Those robots need parts. - Mail!

478
00:44:26,501 --> 00:44:28,768
Mail for Copperbottom.

479
00:44:28,883 --> 00:44:30,573
It belongs to his/her mother.

480
00:44:30,728 --> 00:44:33,840
- Does he/she have something for me? - He/she has yes.

481
00:44:35,608 --> 00:44:37,145
It belongs to my sister!

482
00:44:37,260 --> 00:44:38,873
I recognized the letter.

483
00:44:39,028 --> 00:44:40,411
Something wrong?

484
00:44:40,565 --> 00:44:44,177
He/she says that his/her father is on the verge of turning junk-dealer.

485
00:44:44,331 --> 00:44:46,060
If they don't arrange parts for him,

486
00:44:46,175 --> 00:44:47,865
he/she will only live more some miles.

487
00:44:48,135 --> 00:44:52,707
Is Rodney, very concerned with his/her father? Does he/she want to go home?

488
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:55,013
Same if I go cannot help him/it.

489
00:44:55,128 --> 00:44:59,777
He needs parts and only Bigweld can solve that.

490
00:45:03,121 --> 00:45:05,349
He wants to say something. What was, boy?

491
00:45:06,695 --> 00:45:09,192
Bigweld... it goes...

492
00:45:09,385 --> 00:45:10,576
to dance!

493
00:45:10,729 --> 00:45:13,803
Clear! The dance of Bigweld!

494
00:45:13,957 --> 00:45:17,146
It cannot have dance without Bigweld!

495
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,836
Then it is that! I will go to the dance.

496
00:45:20,029 --> 00:45:23,448
It is the chic party of the year. Nor it will go by the gate.

497
00:45:34,054 --> 00:45:36,859
- Can I help them? - I have faith that yes.

498
00:45:37,013 --> 00:45:40,356
That is Condorodorik Von Grokenzipper!

499
00:45:40,548 --> 00:45:42,469
Knowner like Conde Del Crock.

500
00:45:42,585 --> 00:45:44,506
Where are the trumpets?

501
00:45:44,891 --> 00:45:47,542
They were promised trumpets to announce the count's arrival.

502
00:45:47,926 --> 00:45:50,385
Excuse, his/her grace. I can beat myself until being happy.

503
00:45:50,847 --> 00:45:53,805
He is happy and I don't feel bad also.

504
00:45:55,881 --> 00:45:57,994
- You are not in the list? - As it is that it is?

505
00:45:58,148 --> 00:45:59,531
Again.

506
00:46:00,146 --> 00:46:01,683
Thank you.

507
00:46:01,798 --> 00:46:06,140
We leave. Explain to their superiors the reason

508
00:46:06,179 --> 00:46:10,636
why we could not participate in his/her lual, party, be there what goes.

509
00:46:10,829 --> 00:46:14,748
- We are going! - Not! Wait!

510
00:46:14,902 --> 00:46:16,746
They can enter. Actually,

511
00:46:16,938 --> 00:46:18,551
would the count like to beat me?

512
00:46:18,783 --> 00:46:21,972
That arrogance!

513
00:46:22,087 --> 00:46:24,315
I will beat you on behalf of him.

514
00:46:25,046 --> 00:46:26,621
Thank you, his/her grace.

515
00:46:29,312 --> 00:46:30,541
Certain, we will separate.

516
00:46:30,695 --> 00:46:32,846
To meet Bigweld, call me.

517
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,459
If something gives wrong, we have to use a sign.

518
00:46:36,613 --> 00:46:41,992
What sign type? Something subtle type "has to go" or...

519
00:46:43,529 --> 00:46:44,797
What such that?

520
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:55,710
We are going to the work.

521
00:46:56,633 --> 00:46:59,783
- Beating, no moved. - Yes, gentleman.

522
00:47:18,805 --> 00:47:20,418
I want what he took!

523
00:47:20,765 --> 00:47:24,915
I like that sees me like this, Cappy. Far away from the work.

524
00:47:25,068 --> 00:47:28,103
He/she can see my side more informal, more loving.

525
00:47:32,062 --> 00:47:33,752
Where were we?

526
00:47:34,137 --> 00:47:37,480
I was never interested in men in those parties.

527
00:47:37,672 --> 00:47:41,130
Good night, young ladies. Conde Von to Split at your disposal.

528
00:47:41,284 --> 00:47:49,007
I am Loretta. You seem to be an eccentric millionaire.

529
00:47:51,006 --> 00:47:57,115
Ladies and gentlemen, receive his/her boss,

530
00:47:57,308 --> 00:48:00,497
- Mr. Ratchet! - Thank you.

531
00:48:00,728 --> 00:48:06,837
That is the hour in that I have the honor of presenting to you

532
00:48:06,992 --> 00:48:09,720
ours adored Bigweld,

533
00:48:09,874 --> 00:48:12,909
that unhappily could not attend.

534
00:48:14,139 --> 00:48:14,792
How?

535
00:48:14,946 --> 00:48:18,980
He ordered their excuses, his/her affection and that sack of cookies.

536
00:48:19,134 --> 00:48:22,208
- Doesn't he come? - The one what are you making here?

537
00:48:22,362 --> 00:48:24,091
What did you make with Bigweld?

538
00:48:25,974 --> 00:48:28,241
Why don't see him/it more?

539
00:48:28,395 --> 00:48:32,391
- Safety, we have a gatecrasher. - It is quite so!

540
00:48:32,584 --> 00:48:35,504
I had to put that garbage hill to enter here

541
00:48:35,773 --> 00:48:40,345
and to say for Bigweld that you are putting an end to millions of robots

542
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:43,343
that the day I passed repairing!

543
00:48:43,458 --> 00:48:44,995
You!

544
00:49:04,555 --> 00:49:07,398
The voice of the duty calls me!

545
00:49:07,552 --> 00:49:08,896
I need to leave!

546
00:49:11,126 --> 00:49:16,428
Take him/it for a walk and they swallow him/it of turn as clips!

547
00:49:18,004 --> 00:49:19,963
- Not! - Not?

548
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:22,154
I take him/it outside.

549
00:49:23,153 --> 00:49:25,381
Doesn't he/she want to seem bad for the people, right?

550
00:49:25,728 --> 00:49:29,609
- Well thought. - When I return, I will show my informal side.

551
00:49:31,299 --> 00:49:33,643
- We are going walking! - The one what is making?

552
00:49:33,797 --> 00:49:35,449
Saving his/her life.

553
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:36,832
Let us go!

554
00:49:36,987 --> 00:49:41,213
- Let to go him! Please, let to go him! - Leave of here, his/her idiot!

555
00:49:41,406 --> 00:49:42,136
Diffuse them!

556
00:49:42,213 --> 00:49:43,481
We will Split!

557
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:46,017
To split, wait for me!

558
00:49:46,209 --> 00:49:47,784
Fantastibot!

559
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,781
Leave front!

560
00:49:52,319 --> 00:49:54,547
Tim, I would like to see Mr. Bigweld!

561
00:49:54,701 --> 00:49:55,815
Be not able to!

562
00:50:00,311 --> 00:50:02,655
It was incredible! Where we do go now?

563
00:50:03,078 --> 00:50:04,884
I will take you for the train station.

564
00:50:05,038 --> 00:50:06,882
Of way none!

565
00:50:06,921 --> 00:50:10,571
He/she doesn't know with what is working. Ratchet will kill you.

566
00:50:10,687 --> 00:50:13,530
I won't leave before finding Bigweld.

567
00:50:13,684 --> 00:50:15,336
Can you take me until him?

568
00:50:17,565 --> 00:50:19,409
I must have been crazy.

569
00:50:30,169 --> 00:50:32,128
Good-bye, my wanted.

570
00:50:32,935 --> 00:50:34,625
Thank you for bringing me home.

571
00:50:34,742 --> 00:50:37,739
- It is just more a care the. - Until tomorrow?

572
00:50:37,892 --> 00:50:39,890
I will count the seconds.

573
00:50:40,044 --> 00:50:41,773
4 up to now!

574
00:50:42,734 --> 00:50:44,962
His/her maluquinho.

575
00:50:45,078 --> 00:50:47,229
Maluquinho for you.

576
00:50:58,796 --> 00:51:02,484
I am singing in the oil"

577
00:51:02,601 --> 00:51:05,867
I am singing in the oil"

578
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:12,591
"After so much work, I am slipping in the oil"

579
00:51:12,745 --> 00:51:15,742
I "know what have to do"

580
00:51:15,896 --> 00:51:19,162
"To satisfy" you

581
00:51:19,316 --> 00:51:24,734
My life changed! From now on, I am a winner!

582
00:51:25,964 --> 00:51:28,653
Now that I feel alive you cannot make that!

583
00:51:29,153 --> 00:51:30,959
I help...

584
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:41,065
Certain, we tried. We leave.

585
00:51:41,219 --> 00:51:44,792
No, he/she has something strange. All see those newspapers and correspondences.

586
00:51:44,947 --> 00:51:47,713
They must already have stopped giving does time.

587
00:51:47,906 --> 00:51:49,289
Newspaper!

588
00:51:50,749 --> 00:51:52,093
Last edition.

589
00:51:53,208 --> 00:51:55,283
- You something spoke? - His/her beautiful picture.

590
00:51:55,437 --> 00:51:58,318
Evil "robot invades dance" - we Go, we have to remove you of here.

591
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:10,923
That it carries frightening. Perfect.

592
00:52:35,631 --> 00:52:37,014
See that place!

593
00:52:37,168 --> 00:52:41,241
It is the studio of Bigweld! I recognized of the tv program.

594
00:52:41,434 --> 00:52:44,008
Speak quietly, we should not be here.

595
00:52:47,274 --> 00:52:50,962
What does the one know that? The original drawings of the inventions of
Bigweld!

596
00:52:51,079 --> 00:52:52,539
He drew!

597
00:52:52,693 --> 00:52:56,112
That strange. Why would he stop in the middle?

598
00:52:56,266 --> 00:52:59,762
Look! Does he/she remember that?

599
00:52:59,878 --> 00:53:02,375
He/she appeared in the program.

600
00:53:02,530 --> 00:53:06,372
- Rodney, don't know how I can speak, but... - Why are so covered in dust?

601
00:53:06,834 --> 00:53:08,255
Wait! No...

602
00:53:34,232 --> 00:53:36,845
It is much more complex than the ones that appeared in the program.

603
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:15,847
- What will Rodney, make? - I don't know, that is innovation for me!

604
00:54:23,533 --> 00:54:24,685
It is him!

605
00:54:33,447 --> 00:54:36,328
- Who is the king of the beach? - Are you well?

606
00:54:36,482 --> 00:54:40,632
Considering that I am an old one fat that has just fallen in the ground,

607
00:54:40,786 --> 00:54:43,130
I am fantastic. Now, who devils are you?

608
00:54:43,284 --> 00:54:44,667
I am Rodney.

609
00:54:44,821 --> 00:54:47,549
I thought it was the deliverer of dominoes.

610
00:54:47,703 --> 00:54:50,584
We will arrange again! That time will be larger.

611
00:54:50,777 --> 00:54:53,620
Mister, is it in that what has been working?

612
00:54:53,774 --> 00:54:55,541
Is it for that what is disappeared?

613
00:54:57,079 --> 00:54:59,922
Boy, nobody likes of talkative.

614
00:55:00,076 --> 00:55:03,495
But a terrible crisis is happening. We needed to talk.

615
00:55:05,225 --> 00:55:09,221
Filho, you are causing a first terrible impression.

616
00:55:09,376 --> 00:55:13,180
Mister, he is his/her largest fan. Actually, he is an inventor.

617
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:15,523
As well as you. Show what you did.

618
00:55:15,677 --> 00:55:18,366
A device?

619
00:55:19,751 --> 00:55:22,825
Don't get scared. Show to Mr. Bigweld that can do.

620
00:55:24,208 --> 00:55:25,706
It can go, it is everything well.

621
00:55:29,703 --> 00:55:31,931
Is it that what he does?

622
00:55:34,391 --> 00:55:38,656
- He is nervous under pressure, but... - Filho, I will feel a piece of advice.

623
00:55:38,810 --> 00:55:40,500
- Yes... - Give up.

624
00:55:40,924 --> 00:55:44,689
Is he/she telling me to abandon everything? - I said "gives up."

625
00:55:45,035 --> 00:55:46,879
But to "abandon" also serves.

626
00:55:47,418 --> 00:55:51,414
Is it that what you did? Therefore it is here while Ratchet

627
00:55:51,683 --> 00:55:54,065
does he/she transform robots as my father in obsolete?

628
00:55:54,219 --> 00:55:57,024
Sometimes you have to know that doesn't work more.

629
00:55:57,178 --> 00:55:59,714
But you are Bigweld! It can repair any thing!

630
00:55:59,829 --> 00:56:01,904
I thought so.

631
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:05,093
To have a company for me meant to improve the life of all.

632
00:56:05,248 --> 00:56:08,398
But Ratchet made money and that was more important.

633
00:56:08,591 --> 00:56:12,049
I was old-fashioned. I became obsolete.

634
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:16,545
Go to house, son. If he won me, you will expire.

635
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:18,850
Who you sought doesn't exist more!

636
00:56:19,004 --> 00:56:21,617
Find another foolish dream!

637
00:56:21,771 --> 00:56:26,920
Now if they give me license, I am a lot... busy.

638
00:56:28,265 --> 00:56:29,648
I am seeing.

639
00:56:32,454 --> 00:56:34,836
Everything that I wanted was to be like him.

640
00:56:47,017 --> 00:56:49,937
Help! Open that!

641
00:56:50,283 --> 00:56:53,395
Close! He/she can close!

642
00:57:03,502 --> 00:57:04,731
How many parts only see!

643
00:57:04,924 --> 00:57:08,997
So many things that I always wanted...

644
00:57:09,151 --> 00:57:11,264
That is too much!

645
00:57:27,519 --> 00:57:31,630
- For here, mother. - It lets me to look! I don't tolerate!

646
00:57:31,861 --> 00:57:35,742
- He/she cannot look, it is surprised. - You are an evil boy.

647
00:57:35,934 --> 00:57:37,163
Look!

648
00:57:38,009 --> 00:57:40,276
"Crazy mom" - it is with the full tank!

649
00:57:40,468 --> 00:57:42,466
It is ready when he/she wants.

650
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:46,001
You are the best son that a mother can have.

651
00:57:46,156 --> 00:57:48,346
I also discovered who was repairing the robots.

652
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:54,456
That belezinha will slice all of the obsolete models that to find.

653
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:56,261
I am only made sick of looking.

654
00:57:56,838 --> 00:57:58,874
What is that?

655
00:58:28,271 --> 00:58:30,038
That is not right!

656
00:58:31,038 --> 00:58:33,305
Help!

657
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:42,949
Rivet Town, please.

658
00:58:47,638 --> 00:58:50,481
Hi, mother. I am well.

659
00:58:50,635 --> 00:58:53,978
- And you and the dad? - He is well here.

660
00:58:54,170 --> 00:58:55,284
I will pass for him.

661
00:58:55,438 --> 00:58:58,473
Hello, amigão! How does it go?

662
00:58:58,628 --> 00:59:00,434
Hi, father. How are you?

663
00:59:00,741 --> 00:59:03,238
I am well. Me...

664
00:59:04,507 --> 00:59:06,120
I only caught some rain.

665
00:59:06,774 --> 00:59:11,385
We are only with difficulties of finding some parts.

666
00:59:11,501 --> 00:59:13,460
But we will speak about you.

667
00:59:13,576 --> 00:59:16,534
What is making he/she? Did he/she find with Bigweld?

668
00:59:16,688 --> 00:59:18,148
I found yes.

669
00:59:18,302 --> 00:59:21,222
- But... - What was the one, son?

670
00:59:21,415 --> 00:59:24,834
It was not how we waited, father.

671
00:59:25,027 --> 00:59:28,600
It is not... I am not able to...

672
00:59:28,754 --> 00:59:29,791
I understand.

673
00:59:30,291 --> 00:59:33,057
- Excuse to be disappointed. - Anything of that.

674
00:59:33,173 --> 00:59:35,709
You would never be disappointed, Rodney.

675
00:59:38,284 --> 00:59:40,628
Listen, I know that it is not easy.

676
00:59:40,782 --> 00:59:43,318
But to give up a dream

677
00:59:43,510 --> 00:59:46,468
it can worry for the rest of the life.

678
00:59:48,390 --> 00:59:51,156
- Yes, father. - It is with you, son.

679
00:59:55,806 --> 00:59:58,419
- His/her father loves you a lot. - I know.

680
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:04,452
If he/she wants to speak with his/her family and friends he/she will have 500
minutes free.

681
01:00:04,683 --> 01:00:08,064
Rodney, wait!

682
01:00:09,217 --> 01:00:12,252
- His/her suitcase. - Thank you, but me no...

683
01:00:11,331 --> 01:00:14,943
Their friends wanted to come to dismiss also.

684
01:00:15,097 --> 01:00:16,480
Why didn't come?

685
01:00:16,634 --> 01:00:18,978
They came.

686
01:00:21,475 --> 01:00:23,396
Of next time we will split a taxi.

687
01:00:25,472 --> 01:00:27,431
Who is she?

688
01:00:27,585 --> 01:00:29,775
I had a body like this.

689
01:00:30,775 --> 01:00:33,042
A passage for any place!

690
01:00:33,426 --> 01:00:34,732
To split?

691
01:00:34,886 --> 01:00:36,307
I have a sister!

692
01:00:37,077 --> 01:00:39,036
A sister very it finds strange.

693
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:42,033
I saw the sweepers!

694
01:00:42,072 --> 01:00:45,453
They are there below and they will come to stick to!

695
01:00:45,569 --> 01:00:49,257
And who do guess is behind everything?

696
01:00:49,411 --> 01:00:51,217
- Ratchet. - Don't they want to try to guess?

697
01:00:51,371 --> 01:00:54,406
- We go there, they can try. - Ratchet!

698
01:00:54,522 --> 01:00:58,864
Ratchet. We won't last one week.

699
01:00:59,018 --> 01:01:02,437
Certain, I have a plan. All will catch the train!

700
01:01:03,706 --> 01:01:05,896
Wait for a little. Are all giving up?

701
01:01:06,050 --> 01:01:08,317
- It was you that began. - And I will finish.

702
01:01:08,433 --> 01:01:11,238
My mistake was to think Bigweld would struggle for us.

703
01:01:11,391 --> 01:01:15,963
But the responsibility is ours! If we don't stop Ratchet, nobody will stop.

704
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:17,923
We will hit back!

705
01:01:18,039 --> 01:01:21,881
- To struggle doesn't solve the things. - To give up also not!

706
01:01:21,997 --> 01:01:24,110
- Me that he/she says him/it. - He/she is the boss.

707
01:01:24,956 --> 01:01:27,031
As it beats my heart.

708
01:01:27,146 --> 01:01:30,066
If you will struggle, I am going with you.

709
01:01:30,182 --> 01:01:34,370
- Does it go even? - Who is that charming lady?

710
01:01:34,755 --> 01:01:36,023
- Why? - I know there...

711
01:01:36,215 --> 01:01:38,482
Because I am man, woman's taste...

712
01:01:38,636 --> 01:01:40,057
No. Why will help us?

713
01:01:40,211 --> 01:01:44,322
Why I want to be same to you.

714
01:01:48,434 --> 01:01:49,740
Then we go there.

715
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:53,929
We will give to Ratchet a repair to the old fashion!

716
01:01:56,542 --> 01:01:58,194
That man!

717
01:02:00,001 --> 01:02:01,922
Somebody calls a crane.

718
01:02:08,954 --> 01:02:12,604
Mother, I am already adult! Stop telling me how to kill Bigweld.

719
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:16,870
I will do in the day that wants and as he/she wants.

720
01:02:21,635 --> 01:02:24,516
I want you two in my room in 10 minutes.

721
01:02:24,709 --> 01:02:26,822
Should Mr. Bigweld, also go?

722
01:02:26,938 --> 01:02:31,088
No, be here and watch the dad's limousine.

723
01:02:31,203 --> 01:02:34,200
- Yes, gentleman. - I am going there inside to kick some behind.

724
01:02:34,316 --> 01:02:36,506
His/her boyfriend is a genius.

725
01:02:36,929 --> 01:02:38,927
- He is not... is it? - Am I?

726
01:02:41,232 --> 01:02:43,345
Thank you for still to believe in me.

727
01:02:43,538 --> 01:02:45,497
It is good to be home.

728
01:02:55,719 --> 01:02:58,716
He makes to feel as if everyday they went a party...

729
01:02:58,755 --> 01:03:01,560
Say Ratchet that he has company.

730
01:03:01,791 --> 01:03:03,097
Yes, gentleman!

731
01:03:18,083 --> 01:03:19,082
Mr. Bigweld!

732
01:03:20,427 --> 01:03:23,923
Say that I am not here! Don't let to enter him!

733
01:03:24,116 --> 01:03:25,460
Ratchet!

734
01:03:27,652 --> 01:03:30,265
- I go direct to the subject. - The one what was there? Did they finish the
dominoes?

735
01:03:30,418 --> 01:03:31,955
- I order more! - It is dismissed!

736
01:03:32,148 --> 01:03:36,067
But the company never gave so much profit!

737
01:03:36,221 --> 01:03:39,756
- He/she can leave! - No, listen to me please!

738
01:03:39,987 --> 01:03:42,600
He/she cannot make that with me, that job is my life!

739
01:03:42,753 --> 01:03:46,172
Everything is for me. He/she doesn't know what did to arrive here.

740
01:03:46,327 --> 01:03:49,477
The lies that I counted, the lives that I ruined...

741
01:03:49,593 --> 01:03:50,784
That is not helping each other me.

742
01:03:50,938 --> 01:03:52,475
Call the safety.

743
01:03:52,629 --> 01:03:56,356
Wait! Can I make a last appeal?

744
01:03:56,471 --> 01:03:58,084
What does certain, mean?

745
01:03:58,239 --> 01:03:59,084
That!

746
01:04:00,314 --> 01:04:02,696
Mine ours, I am as crazy as my mother!

747
01:04:12,111 --> 01:04:15,684
Light the fat for it undoes him/it and put my name in his/her vacancy.

748
01:04:15,915 --> 01:04:17,490
Loosen him/it!

749
01:04:18,490 --> 01:04:20,565
Face, boy. He/she ended.

750
01:04:20,719 --> 01:04:25,061
You lost. Bigweld will be melted to turn an improvement.

751
01:04:25,214 --> 01:04:28,902
With you, his/her stupid coffeepot and Cappy.

752
01:04:30,095 --> 01:04:31,324
That waste.

753
01:05:05,831 --> 01:05:10,365
- Mr. Bigweld, are you well? - I am the most beautiful girl of the dance.

754
01:05:10,635 --> 01:05:12,364
I will consider as a "no!"

755
01:05:25,544 --> 01:05:26,850
Leave the road!

756
01:05:29,041 --> 01:05:30,424
Rodney!

757
01:05:45,218 --> 01:05:46,678
You only pay capuchin monkey!

758
01:05:48,369 --> 01:05:50,482
It is Rodney. It seems that it is in trouble!

759
01:05:50,637 --> 01:05:54,402
- I have to repair him/it. - Certain, I protect you!

760
01:06:00,551 --> 01:06:02,280
We have to help Rodney.

761
01:06:04,854 --> 01:06:07,390
- You are here. - Anything of that!

762
01:06:07,659 --> 01:06:11,770
We will face a great battle. He/she doesn't matter what will happen with us.

763
01:06:11,925 --> 01:06:13,346
Live his/her life.

764
01:06:13,616 --> 01:06:15,844
You are the only thing that I have!

765
01:06:16,920 --> 01:06:20,570
Piper, they are going to a great battle.

766
01:06:52,157 --> 01:06:53,002
I got!

767
01:06:53,156 --> 01:06:55,000
What is Rodney, happening?

768
01:06:55,155 --> 01:06:57,230
- Where are we? - It is everything well.

769
01:07:17,404 --> 01:07:20,977
Certain, boys! They are well where wanted. Get up.

770
01:07:22,476 --> 01:07:23,705
He/she looks at the hands there below.

771
01:07:26,088 --> 01:07:27,970
Rodney, came to survive!

772
01:07:35,848 --> 01:07:37,346
How are we doing?

773
01:07:46,339 --> 01:07:49,605
The socket. Hold strong, I need to arrive to the other side.

774
01:08:19,923 --> 01:08:20,998
We will leave of here.

775
01:08:41,096 --> 01:08:43,977
- It is it undoes. - It is that. Game end.

776
01:08:44,132 --> 01:08:45,861
He/she still didn't finish.

777
01:08:46,015 --> 01:08:48,128
It is our chance of shining.

778
01:08:48,244 --> 01:08:50,972
It is when we showed of what are done.

779
01:08:53,393 --> 01:08:56,928
In my case, it is a metal called rare "medum." It is yellow,

780
01:08:57,043 --> 01:08:59,041
he/she has chicken taste...

781
01:09:00,271 --> 01:09:01,846
He/she didn't know that could make that.

782
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,881
Rodney is right. I am tired

783
01:09:05,036 --> 01:09:08,801
of complaining and never to do anything.

784
01:09:09,032 --> 01:09:12,067
Me... I want to try.

785
01:09:12,222 --> 01:09:15,795
Forget, I feel a lot... No, me...

786
01:09:15,949 --> 01:09:17,639
I want to try!

787
01:09:17,909 --> 01:09:19,522
Then you are the first.

788
01:09:22,174 --> 01:09:23,096
First so that?

789
01:09:23,250 --> 01:09:26,285
Do they want us to make improvements? Then we will make them.

790
01:09:32,588 --> 01:09:36,276
Gasket, you are an evil and unhealthy robot.

791
01:09:36,546 --> 01:09:37,468
I try.

792
01:10:08,670 --> 01:10:11,705
That good! Company!

793
01:10:11,821 --> 01:10:16,624
You are the busybody that it has been causing so many problems.

794
01:10:16,778 --> 01:10:18,699
But who are those losers?

795
01:10:18,853 --> 01:10:20,543
- Mister, us... - I am woman!

796
01:10:22,389 --> 01:10:25,463
We came to rescue our friend, sack of screws of the evil!

797
01:10:25,578 --> 01:10:31,226
And you will be defeated in their own domains.

798
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:35,184
Yes, because they are 7 against only 1.

799
01:10:39,450 --> 01:10:43,715
- We are 7 against ...8, 9... - Did it count that there?

800
01:10:44,100 --> 01:10:45,867
I think so. Can they be quiet?

801
01:10:46,136 --> 01:10:49,133
I lost the bill, I will have to count again!

802
01:10:49,287 --> 01:10:52,284
While it is counting, include that!

803
01:10:57,779 --> 01:11:01,314
As soon as I end with you, they will invade the streets.

804
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:05,849
That will be his/her last day!

805
01:11:15,225 --> 01:11:16,723
Did I lose the commemoration?

806
01:11:18,222 --> 01:11:18,952
No.

807
01:11:19,106 --> 01:11:20,604
Actually, it arrived early.

808
01:11:26,445 --> 01:11:29,480
Rodney! Rodney!

809
01:11:29,596 --> 01:11:31,171
Then we will begin!

810
01:11:31,518 --> 01:11:33,400
He/she ordered well, sister!

811
01:11:33,554 --> 01:11:35,091
To attack!

812
01:11:59,223 --> 01:12:01,029
Oh, not! He went diffuse!

813
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:05,948
Only see that devastating blow!

814
01:12:06,947 --> 01:12:08,484
He climbs until the top...

815
01:12:08,753 --> 01:12:10,366
and it puts an end to all!

816
01:12:48,294 --> 01:12:50,561
Say hi for my "amigona."

817
01:14:11,141 --> 01:14:13,369
That will be disgusting!

818
01:14:17,443 --> 01:14:20,286
- Is he/she thinking about the one what am thinking? - With certainty!

819
01:14:34,927 --> 01:14:39,384
- He/she discovers a need and put an end to her! - I was not thinking about
that.

820
01:14:52,373 --> 01:14:54,793
What are you making? Release me!

821
01:14:56,830 --> 01:14:59,481
Come unfastened! Obey!

822
01:15:09,665 --> 01:15:10,971
My improvements!

823
01:15:33,681 --> 01:15:37,984
Everything well, son. You can shine, it doesn't matter of what is...

824
01:15:38,139 --> 01:15:39,599
Stop!

825
01:15:40,099 --> 01:15:44,441
Come, Rodney. We will open the gates of the industry for all!

826
01:15:44,595 --> 01:15:47,246
First I need to do a thing.

827
01:15:52,395 --> 01:15:54,162
- Herb! - The one what is making, done want?

828
01:15:54,240 --> 01:15:56,545
- It is Rodney, dear! - Is he well?

829
01:15:56,622 --> 01:16:00,387
- Come outside. - Copperbottom, where what does think goes?

830
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:02,117
And the plates?

831
01:16:05,652 --> 01:16:06,727
I have, return here!

832
01:16:07,074 --> 01:16:08,956
He/she will never again wash anything in that city!

833
01:16:12,876 --> 01:16:15,296
What is that? The whole city is here.

834
01:16:16,604 --> 01:16:18,217
- Rodney? - Father!

835
01:16:18,487 --> 01:16:20,485
I want him to know somebody.

836
01:16:20,677 --> 01:16:22,982
- That is... - Bigweld, father.

837
01:16:23,136 --> 01:16:25,095
The largest robot of the world.

838
01:16:25,250 --> 01:16:29,438
- Besides you. - I know that he/she needs some parts.

839
01:16:29,592 --> 01:16:31,859
I am not of complaining, but...

840
01:16:32,013 --> 01:16:35,010
He/she has enough to set up two of you.

841
01:16:36,163 --> 01:16:39,121
Ladies and gentlemen...

842
01:16:39,275 --> 01:16:42,656
I came here...

843
01:16:42,849 --> 01:16:46,230
- Stop with that, he/she is becoming distracted. - Excuse.

844
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:47,960
Where was I?

845
01:16:48,114 --> 01:16:51,918
Mr. and Mrs. Copperbottom, I came here

846
01:16:52,071 --> 01:16:55,298
to tell them personally that his/her son Rodney,

847
01:16:55,415 --> 01:16:58,988
the responsible for removing me of my confinement,

848
01:16:59,142 --> 01:17:04,060
he/she is my new right robot and my future successor.

849
01:17:13,706 --> 01:17:15,819
Filho...

850
01:17:17,010 --> 01:17:21,890
Father, I know that always if he/she felt bad for not could give me a lot of
thing,

851
01:17:22,044 --> 01:17:24,925
but you gave me the most important thing.

852
01:17:25,080 --> 01:17:26,732
You believed in me.

853
01:17:26,886 --> 01:17:29,345
Since the moment in that he/she was born.

854
01:17:30,844 --> 01:17:33,149
Now I want that his/her dream if it accomplishes.

855
01:17:35,148 --> 01:17:37,184
You always wanted to be musician.

856
01:17:37,338 --> 01:17:38,567
Now be one!

857
01:17:39,067 --> 01:17:40,450
For all they listen.

858
01:17:51,517 --> 01:17:53,015
It is that there, Herb!

859
01:17:55,014 --> 01:17:57,665
Now I am sure that I have a heart.

860
01:17:58,934 --> 01:18:02,277
Forgive me, but I am a little rusty.

861
01:18:17,032 --> 01:18:18,415
There he/she is leaving our happy end.

862
01:18:18,685 --> 01:18:21,643
No, it is a jazz mixture and funk.

863
01:18:21,989 --> 01:18:23,257
He/she calls himself "junk."

864
01:18:37,398 --> 01:18:39,511
I love you, dear!

865
01:19:58,363 --> 01:20:00,476
- To split! - My dear Loretta!

866
01:20:01,745 --> 01:20:03,397
Oops! Excuse!

867
01:20:07,240 --> 01:20:11,505
I am in the list of the party! Who doesn't know he/she I am?
