1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,720


2
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,839
Sweet dreams are made of this

3
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:25,960
Who am I to disagree?

4
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,920
Travel the world
and the seven seas

5
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,799
Everybody's looking
for something

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:40,960
Some of them
want to use you

7
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:46,520
Some of them want
to get used by you

8
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,320
Some of them
want to abuse you

9
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:57,320
Some of them want to be abused.

10
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,280
4 BATTLES TO FREEDOM

11
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,280
JOIN THE FAMILY

12
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:50,200
SAVE POINT: 414 METERS

13
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:25,719
Take the fucking team back.

14
00:03:38,439 --> 00:03:40,439
Turn me around.

15
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,599
Shit!

16
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:46,199
Good run, Kable.

17
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:50,759
- My name is Tillman.
- Whatever your name is,

18
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,920
- you got to the save point fast.
- Who the fuck cares?

19
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,240
No one is getting out of here alive.

20
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,199
I am. I'm gonna make it out.

21
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,800
Sure you will.

22
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,759
They said you got 3 battles left
before you get out.

23
00:05:11,519 --> 00:05:14,480
Bob!

24
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:15,959
Let me handle this.
Bob!

25
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:18,199
- Do we have the interview or don't?
- Yes,

26
00:05:18,199 --> 00:05:19,560
we are cunt hair close.

27
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:22,519
Look I'm not going to blow the
3 asian wars for close.

28
00:05:22,519 --> 00:05:25,439
With all do respect, Bob,
nobody cares about dead orientals.

29
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:28,759
- They care about Ken Castle.
- Can I hear it from Gina, please?

30
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:30,319
Okay, Bob...

31
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,600
Bob, are you aware that Castle has clocked
exactly one media appearance state,

32
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,240
and that was Walter's last interview
before she died, that would be 9 fucking years ago!

33
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,040
Stop menstruating and just tell me
whether we fucking have it?

34
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,120
We fucking, have it.

35
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,680
Good!

36
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,240
Okay, focus.
Let's get lunch.

37
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:52,879
Iranian, sushi or mexican?

38
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,720
Burger chili fried?

39
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,360
I could eat a burger.

40
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,199
We live in society.

41
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,600
We visit society.

42
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:05,240
I mean,

43
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:08,240
which one, which one is
more real? Really?

44
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,079
I mean, which one is really real?
You know what I mean?

45
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:19,319
You're watching
Gina Parker Smith, alive!

46
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:22,199
World link tonight exclusive!

47
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:24,720
This motherfucker is
off the charts.

48
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,399
You realize he could
buy the network.

49
00:06:26,399 --> 00:06:27,959
Yeah, why would he?
The son of a bitch pulls

50
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,759
650 millions pay-per-views
for one single broadcast.

51
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:35,439
Going live in...
5... 4... 3... 2... 1...

52
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,120
First, there was "Society".

53
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,800
The ultimate sim environment,
where players don't control

54
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:45,240
virtual animated characters,
but actual,

55
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,759
living, breathing human beings.

56
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,560
They walked them, they talked them,
they juiced them, they rocked them.

57
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,279
Rickidy dickidy doo.
We had that on t-shirts
back on 2010.

58
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:57,560
The creation of reclusive genius
Ken Castle...

59
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:59,240
"Who is Ken Castle?"

60
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,240
"Society" took the
world by storm,

61
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,120
becoming the number one guilty
pleasure of billions.

62
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,839
You can get paid
to be controlled,

63
00:07:06,839 --> 00:07:08,800
or you can pay to control.

64
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,839
And generating one of the world's
largest private fortunes,

65
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:14,680
surpassing Bill Gates
practically, over night.

66
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:20,439
Nine months ago,
Castle availed a new simulation.

67
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:25,120
One that would take gaming into new heights
of thrilling excess...

68
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,040
and controversy.

69
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:29,399
SLAYERS

70
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:33,000
Slayers, if "Society" let us
live through others,

71
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,840
"Slayers" could let us
die through others.

72
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,519
Slayers gives the gamer full control
of a flesh and blood human being,

73
00:07:40,519 --> 00:07:42,600
in full scale
kill or be killed combat.

74
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,800
And when we say "flesh and blood"

75
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,040
We mean, flesh...
and blood.

76
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,840
- Slayers.
- Slayers!

77
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,680
Why isn't it murder?

78
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,199
Gina, when was the last time you saw someone
volunteer to be murdered?

79
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:10,079
I'm sure you know that every last one
of our Slayers is a bonified death row inmate.

80
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:12,480
Each one offered the chance to participate
as an alternative to their sentences.

81
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,879
If you stay alive for 30 sessions,
you can get set free.

82
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,439
That's not a bad goddamn deal.

83
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,720
And has any of these men or women have
actually survived long enough to be set free?

84
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,360
Well I remind the audience that Slayers
was put together with a full cooperation

85
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,480
and approval, of the United States
Federal government.

86
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,040
That the revenue that produces...

87
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,519
is responsible for funding
our entire prison system...

88
00:08:31,519 --> 00:08:33,720
keeping the bad guys
behind bars.

89
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:37,080
And that the prop was voted
for by a cock solid 68% of the american public.

90
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:39,840
In an election tainted by
a suspected digital fraud.

91
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:42,360
Let's talk about the
so called "genericons".

92
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:44,360
Sent into the Slayers environment,

93
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,279
With a set of pre programmed actions,
with no one controlling them,

94
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:51,519
and no way to react, their chances
of survival next to nil?

95
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:54,519
There's plenty of men and women in prison
who can never cut it to Slayers

96
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:57,879
shouldn't they be given the same chance,
roll the dice for a ticket out?

97
00:08:57,879 --> 00:09:00,159
Besides they only need to survive
one session.

98
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,360
Right.

99
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:04,399
So Mr. Castle,
how the hell does it work?

100
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:08,320
It begins with a single nano cell
planted in the motor cortex of the brain.

101
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,480
This cell can replicate,

102
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,679
replacing the cells around it
with perfect copies.

103
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:18,799
And these copied cells contain
remote access functionality.

104
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:21,639
Therefore nano plus cortex,
equals a "nanex".

105
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:24,440
Is it true, that every human
that undergoes this procedure,

106
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,440
will have a distinct "ip" address,
like a mobile device...

107
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,360
- or a notebook computer?
- Similar, yes.

108
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:33,159
But control is strictly localized
with the parameters of our gaming environment.

109
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:35,080
You take "Society" for instance.

110
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,120
Once our cast member has left the workplace
they're completely free,

111
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:40,399
from the control and
monitoring of their player.

112
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,840
Oh well that's a relief!

113
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,759
For some, maybe.

114
00:09:44,759 --> 00:09:46,320
For some...

115
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:55,000
Don't you suspect some folks wouldn't
mind a bit of controlling?

116
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,279
Someone else making all the
decisions for you?

117
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,039
No tough choices,
no responsibilities?

118
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:06,639
- Think about it.
- We will, Mr. Castle.

119
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,039
We will!

120
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,080
The Gina Parker Smith Show!
Sponsored by...

121
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,639
SLAYERS

122
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,039
Good little talk?

123
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:20,080
Oh, shit!
My pleasure!

124
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:23,159
Can I just tell you, I cannot wait
until the next Slayers,

125
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:25,320
I mean,
Kable has been unbelievable!

126
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:28,639
His arms are just so...
well I know they're terrible!

127
00:10:32,799 --> 00:10:34,320
What the hell is that?

128
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:38,600
Ken Castle wants you to believe that
we are living in a better, safer world.

129
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,440
- His a liar! When mind controlling his Slayers...
- Mr. Castle, we have no idea where this is...

130
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,120
We will all be his dogs if we allowed
this evolution to continue.

131
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,879
That's a goddamn hoot!

132
00:10:57,879 --> 00:11:01,679
This is nuts, it's like the signal is generating
simultaneously from six countries.

133
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,799
Reroute to the backup servers please, now.
Now!

134
00:11:04,799 --> 00:11:08,759
Ah, Mr.Castle, we can't stop every
virus that sneaks in.

135
00:11:08,759 --> 00:11:11,799
You might want to let my home boys
take a look at your firewall.

136
00:11:11,799 --> 00:11:14,240
We're on it. They'll be off
the air momentarily.

137
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,720
So sorry.

138
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,919
- What about you sugar woman, mind if breach
your firewall one of these days?
- You bad!

139
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:26,639
He's good!

140
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:30,480
Hit him!
Fuck him up

141
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:40,120
Get down!
Get the fuck down!

142
00:12:36,759 --> 00:12:38,320
Kable!

143
00:12:43,879 --> 00:12:45,519
My name is Tillman.

144
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,799
Yeah yeah. Tillsman, Tillsman

145
00:12:48,799 --> 00:12:52,080
They said your name was Tillsman.

146
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:55,919
You're just sitting, eh?.

147
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,360
Sitting and looking, just looking and sitting...
Just like me, man.

148
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:03,480
Keeping my wholes down,
you gotta keep your whole's down ...

149
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,039
everyday, till...
everybody snaps, breaks...

150
00:13:07,039 --> 00:13:09,240
starts to crack up, you know,
because you don't know if

151
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,720
you're going to live
a day or two or die.

152
00:13:12,519 --> 00:13:15,120
Anybody but you, right?

153
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,200
27 battles, huh? Until you go...

154
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,679
Nobody has ever done it.
No man has ever come that close.

155
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:23,679
No one has even got 10 games
without getting their brain shot...

156
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:28,200
anybody but Kable. Kable, because
you're sitting and looking, huh man?

157
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:33,840
You're gotta plan in your head, you gotta mission,
you never break, you never snap,

158
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:38,600
you never say shit either, but you
take care of your business, don't you?

159
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,919
Niggers can get spooked by that kind of
single mindness, you know what I mean?

160
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,840
Cause you're spooky.

161
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:45,960
You spook me.

162
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,440
Whatcha in for?

163
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:34,039
WILL HE MAKE IT? WATCH IT LIVE

00:15:02,799 --> 00:15:05,000
I Am right here with you

166
00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:09,919
You want to get back to them.

167
00:15:09,919 --> 00:15:13,559
It's all you think about.
It's the only thing that keeps you alive.

168
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:16,759
- Who's talking?
- Sign it.

169
00:15:17,919 --> 00:15:22,559
- What?
- Sign it. Please Tillman.

170
00:15:22,559 --> 00:15:26,000
My son David is your biggest fan.
He prays for you.

171
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:38,279
I need to prove it's authentic.
Makes it worth more.

172
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:39,879
Why would anyone want my name?

173
00:15:39,879 --> 00:15:42,559
You don't even know what's
going on out there, do you?

174
00:15:42,559 --> 00:15:44,960
All medical personal
report to central process.

175
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:46,840
- Damn, gotta go.
- No no! Wait,

176
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:49,559
How did you get this picture?
Have you seen them?

177
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,919
Sweat baby sweat baby
sex is a Texas drought.

178
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:21,279
Me and you do the kind of stuff
only Prince would sing about

179
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:25,480
So put your hands down my pants
and you'll be feeling nuts

180
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,399
Yes I'm Siskel,
yes I'm Ebert

181
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:29,600
and you're getting
two thumbs up

182
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:31,919
Come quicker than FedEx never reach an apex,
just like Coca-Cola stock you are inclined,

183
00:16:31,919 --> 00:16:33,759
To make me rise an hour early

184
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,639
just like Daylight Savings Timeo

185
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:40,080
You and me baby
ain't nothin' but mammals

186
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,039
So let's do it like they do
on the Discovery Channell. Do it again now.

187
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:47,440
You and me baby ain't nothin' but mammals
So let's do it

188
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,120
like they do on the Discovery Channel
Gettin' horny now

189
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:23,880
- Hey.
- Hi.

190
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,400
So what's your damage?

191
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:33,839
You know, just hanging out.
Just looking to meet people.

192
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:36,000
...meet people.

193
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,160
Lucky you. You met me.

194
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:50,720
- I'm Nika.
- I'm Dale. I like your fur.

195
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:55,519
- Do you wanna go somewhere?
- Do you wanna go somewhere?

196
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,200
We are somewhere.

197
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:30,680
Ken Castle...Is a liar.
Liar!

198
00:18:31,319 --> 00:18:33,000
Fuck!

199
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,480
A new video prank by
the subversive group Humanz...

200
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:37,799
caused a nation wide
stir today.

201
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:41,480
All contact between "Society" city, and
an estimated 3 quarters of a million players

202
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:44,559
were shut down for 3 hours
while Castle technicians

203
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:48,799
were working on what they described as
a "satellite infection"...

204
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,000
These pranks, at first,
attributed to rogue isolated hackers

205
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,559
are now suspected to be the work of
an elaborate and sophisticated,

206
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:59,000
network of programming cells,
spread around several countries.

207
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
Experts estimate that the service interruption

208
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,319
will end up costing Castle
billions in lost revenue.

209
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:06,480
Well don't cry for Castle,
he can cover this with

210
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,720
change in his couch cushions.

211
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,039
On a personal note,
that shit was fucked up.

212
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:14,160
Yeah it was.
I literally pissed myself.

213
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,880
Sounds like fun.

214
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,559
Seriously, these Humanz cock suckers,
they're are out of control.

215
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:32,279
- Sandra.
- Quiet.

216
00:19:33,279 --> 00:19:38,480
- My name is Sandra.
- Stop talking.

217
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,279
They can't say
I didn't try...

218
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,759
Fuck yeah!

219
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,920
We're all going to die!

220
00:23:53,279 --> 00:23:55,319
Get me out of here!

221
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:00,279
I'm not supposed to be here!

222
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:03,599
Who are they?

223
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:09,519
Who the fuck are they?
Who the fuck is playing us man?

224
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:23,319
Shut up, fish.

225
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:54,119
Gay, gay, gay, tardily gay.

226
00:24:54,119 --> 00:24:55,839
- Swarmers.
- Swarmers.

227
00:24:55,839 --> 00:24:57,759
The latest innovation
from Browning,

228
00:24:57,759 --> 00:24:59,519
this self detonating cartridge...

229
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:01,000
offers the widest
and deadliest spray available...

230
00:25:01,119 --> 00:25:02,720
from a full tracking, cornering coordinates.

231
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,920
- Daddy like it.
- Simon!

232
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,279
Fan girl, stop hacking me.

233
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:09,400
You suck Simon. You're going to get
my boyfriend killed...

234
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:12,440
before he gets out of jail and
before he can fill me up with his!

235
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,079
Simon!
I just wanna play you.

236
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,480
- Forget about that star fucker.
- Shut up bitch!

237
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:19,559
So when am I going to get to meet you,
for like, real?

238
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,240
What's that?

239
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,759
What's up looser?

240
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:26,079
Mum says: Go to college,
move the fuck out, and...

241
00:25:26,079 --> 00:25:28,559
Oh yeah! You're a sick retard!
You're pathetic.

242
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:30,000
You smell like Jeffrey Dahmer.

243
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,799
- Wanna make out?
- You wish.

244
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:34,039
I can't wait until they
cut you out, Simian.

245
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:35,000
Your balls bitch.

246
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,000
- Simon?
- Maybe.

247
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,599
Oh my God! Is really you!

248
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:41,480
- Nice.
- Do you want to see our tits, Simon?

249
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,240
Yes, yes I do.

250
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,440
Now that we have your attention, here's
an offer that you can't refuse.

251
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,640
- Here we go.
- 50 million euros...

252
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,079
for control of Kable.

253
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:53,160
instant transfer to the account
of your choice.

254
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,960
Kable is not for sale,
thank you.

255
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,039
Baby, make a hundred...

256
00:25:56,039 --> 00:25:58,319
Spin the reel!

257
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:06,799
What the fuck?

258
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:22,400
If you want to talk to Kable,
we can show you how.

259
00:26:29,079 --> 00:26:31,559
Look at it.
The new face of Slayers.

260
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:34,039
Pure, crystalized horror,

261
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:37,119
two stories high and
bathed in bloody red.

262
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:38,440
He is what they want.

263
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:39,480
They love Kable.

264
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:40,799
They do now,

265
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:43,880
but when they watch their hero die
right in front of their eye balls...

266
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,319
so sharp and vivid...

267
00:26:45,319 --> 00:26:48,200
if feels like it could've reach out and
touch the wet flesh.

268
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:52,519
They're going to change their point of view
Be seduced by the power.

269
00:26:52,519 --> 00:26:56,799
The violence, the dominance.
Is human nature.

270
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,559
Kable made it to 28 battles, every
player in the game is going to take him out.

271
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:01,559
Yeah, Kable is a perfect soldier,

272
00:27:01,559 --> 00:27:03,799
he's a tactical killing computer.

273
00:27:03,799 --> 00:27:08,400
His only vulnerability is
the nanex itself. The...

274
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,200
delay between Simon's commands

275
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:13,240
and Kable's ability to execute.

276
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:15,319
So why should this one be any different?

277
00:27:15,319 --> 00:27:17,920
Who controls him?

278
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:23,240
No one.

279
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:36,440
Get it out of me!

280
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:57,480
What the hell happened
to this one?

281
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,519
Looks like he escaped.

282
00:28:03,559 --> 00:28:08,680
Hi girls. Back to your exercise.

283
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:20,359
That's Hackman,
Hackman, Hackman, knack man.

284
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:22,839
They say he killed a
whole bunch of people, man.

285
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:24,839
Killed himself all kinds of people.

286
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:29,559
And then one day, he just walks up
and turns himself in...

287
00:28:29,559 --> 00:28:32,720
like he wants to be inside
or some crazy shit like that.

288
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,160
You know what I'm saying?

289
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,640
So it's going to be all
kinds of Slayers, man.

290
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:39,799
As long as you got motherfuckers like
that running around killing...

291
00:28:39,799 --> 00:28:43,839
Kable! Let's go!
Upgrades, come on.

292
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,200
Why don't you upgrade
a brother man?

293
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,599
Why don't you shut the fuck up?!

294
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:57,279
Shut the fuck up. Shut the fuck up.

295
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,759
Fucking, shut the fuck up.

296
00:29:25,839 --> 00:29:28,440
- Who wimps?
- What?

297
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,039
Who wimps,
the player or the slayer?

298
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:41,039
Someone, somewhere else is the eye.

299
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:43,160
It's tripped out, man.

300
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:48,519
Sometimes, they take over.
Completely, they...

301
00:29:48,519 --> 00:29:51,200
move you around like a robot.

302
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,440
- But that don't work so good.
- Why?

303
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,880
The delay.

304
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:00,359
Yeah the ping.
They talk about that.

305
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:03,880
About how long it takes the
Slayer to respond to the command.

306
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,200
Whatever they call it,

307
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,279
the slice of a second out there,
is the difference between living and dying.

308
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,640
When that trigger pulls...

309
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:21,480
it's just me.

310
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:43,680
Hey, Kable.

311
00:30:45,079 --> 00:30:47,119
Look.

312
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,960
I just killed someone.

313
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,200
This is the blood.

314
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:56,680
Look.

315
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:02,240
He's back here.

316
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:03,799
Wanna see?

317
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,559
No your head
ain't working straight.

318
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:15,519
I'm going to kill you too,
on sunday.

319
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:16,799
Yeah, probably.

320
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,720
That's why they put me here.

321
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,480
I got no strings.

322
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,160
I got no strings,
so I have fun.

323
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:29,880
I'm not tied up to anyone.

324
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:34,240
They got strings,
but you can see,

325
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:39,880
there are no strings on me.

326
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,960
You go two whores, Kable.

327
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:45,559
- What the fuck you said?
- Outside.

328
00:31:46,319 --> 00:31:50,440
I'm sorry,
I met your pretty girls.

329
00:31:51,599 --> 00:31:55,039
So you want to get back to them.

330
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,359
But I'm going to visit them first.

331
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:11,079
Alright.

332
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,039
Kable.

333
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:24,000
Kable. Kable, dude. It's me.
It's me.

334
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:25,119
Who?

335
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:28,160
Simon, I'm playing you.

336
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:31,960
- How come I can hear you?
- Well it's mud.

337
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,319
Gamers can't talk to cons.

338
00:32:34,319 --> 00:32:35,880
I know.

339
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:39,559
It's fucking unbelievable.
This is amazing.

340
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:57,079
Cool yeah?

341
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:58,799
No it's not cool.

342
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,279
Pay attention to the fucking game!

343
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:12,519
Okay, okay.
I got it, I got it.

344
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:13,799
What are you, 12?

345
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:16,680
I'm 17 actually,
thank you.

346
00:33:22,279 --> 00:33:24,279
This is unbelievable.

347
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:27,000
How am I not dead yeat?

348
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:29,920
Cause I'm a badass,
motherfucker.

349
00:33:42,319 --> 00:33:44,240
Shit!

350
00:33:50,359 --> 00:33:54,359
Freek, you shouldn't be here.

351
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,159
- Gibs.
- What?

352
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,920
Like giblets. Chunks.
Pieces. Pieces everywhere.

353
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:22,360
These are real humans fucker.

354
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:31,199
Death row, psychos...  so what?

355
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,719
They had it coming anyway, right?

356
00:34:46,559 --> 00:34:48,639
I guess that goes for me too.

357
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,639
Yeah, but you're different.

358
00:34:51,519 --> 00:34:53,519
Different, how?

359
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:56,119
I don't know, because
you're in my side.

360
00:34:56,119 --> 00:34:58,880
Damn new area.

361
00:35:04,159 --> 00:35:07,360
Think about it Kable, all the shit
we've been through together,

362
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,960
what an epic run, man.

363
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:12,039
It's gonna suck to see it end.

364
00:35:12,039 --> 00:35:13,679
Are you fucking kidding me?

365
00:35:13,679 --> 00:35:17,039
Oh yeah, I get that for you is different.

366
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,840
This way.

367
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:26,639
- There's nothing there.
- Trust me, kid.

368
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:29,440
It's restricted area. It's beyond
the border of the game

369
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,760
I couldn't put you there if I tried.

370
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,800
Warning.

371
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,360
Access denied.

372
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,039
Very well.

373
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:46,519
Shit.

374
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,360
Bye, Kable.

375
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:16,119
Come on.

376
00:36:16,119 --> 00:36:19,360
This kid will get me killed.

377
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,280
Dude I'm right here, man.
I can hear you.

378
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,719
Listen to me.

379
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:26,239
I don't know who's behind it or why,

380
00:36:26,239 --> 00:36:30,039
but I was supposed to die tonight.
Lucky for us,

381
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:32,639
I can beat them...

382
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:34,599
but not with you controlling me.

383
00:36:34,599 --> 00:36:36,199
What the hell are you talking about?

384
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:40,679
Turn me lose, kid.
You want to win? Turn me lose.

385
00:36:40,679 --> 00:36:42,440
Find a way.

386
00:36:43,679 --> 00:36:45,800
Bastard.

387
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:56,119
So Ms Roth. Says here you're
applying for custody of your daughter?

388
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:58,599
Delia, her name is Delia.

389
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:02,360
Spouse incarcerated, left without the possibility of parol.

390
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:05,559
- You use your maiden name?
- huh-huh.

391
00:37:06,519 --> 00:37:08,800
My husband, is...

392
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,920
it's not entirely true
regarding his sentence.

393
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:14,159
In fact,
he's due to be released soon.

394
00:37:14,159 --> 00:37:18,320
Ms. Roth,
your husband was charged and...

395
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,679
charged and convicted
of first degree murder,

396
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:25,280
I can't hardly
consider his release,

397
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,599
or if it happened at all..
I don't think it would be a good thing.

398
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,360
So it's says you're an actor?

399
00:37:36,239 --> 00:37:38,840
I don't know that I've
seen you in anything.

400
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,920
I work in "Society".

401
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,400
It's a job.

402
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,039
Ms. Roth, your child has been exceedingly well placed,

403
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:48,840
the new family is very wealthy,
she won't have to work for anything.

404
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:51,760
Now I can understand that
you love your daughter.

405
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:55,760
Probably very much. But do you really
think she would be better off...

406
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,800
with...

407
00:37:57,800 --> 00:37:59,519
people like you?

408
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:05,199
Yes, I do.
I'm her mother.

409
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:11,840
We will give your application on
the consideration of merits.

410
00:38:34,719 --> 00:38:37,599
Body armor purchased

411
00:38:40,239 --> 00:38:41,760
Do you like the software?

412
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:42,800
Software?

413
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,679
The walkie talkie, player.

414
00:38:44,719 --> 00:38:46,239
No shit.

415
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:49,400
You're the guy from the TV,
the Humanz.

416
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:50,559
That's right, baby.

417
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:52,679
You think about
what the brother said?

418
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:54,679
What brother do you refer,
brother?

419
00:38:54,679 --> 00:38:57,280
Kable wants the freedom to ass kick.

420
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,000
Do shit his way.

421
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,360
- Are you going to give it to him?
- You were listening?

422
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,079
We see and hear everything...

423
00:39:03,079 --> 00:39:06,320
everything that goes on inside
that so called game.

424
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,400
Alright then,
Kable said we got lucky...

425
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:12,039
They were gunning for us.
What's that all about?

426
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:14,119
Kable got a past,
he knows things.

427
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:16,119
Things you don't even know.

428
00:39:16,119 --> 00:39:18,960
- What things?
- Things that Castle is afraid of.

429
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,880
As long as you boy stays on the him inside,
Castle knows he can keep him quiet.

430
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:27,679
But if he ever got out... Castle
would never let that happen.

431
00:39:27,679 --> 00:39:28,880
There's one battle left,

432
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:30,639
I think I can handle my own business,
thank you very much.

433
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:32,280
You're not hearing me.

434
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:35,800
This is not something you can control.

435
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,719
They're gonna kill his ass, Simon.

436
00:39:37,719 --> 00:39:39,880
In the eyes of the world,
and then what?

437
00:39:39,880 --> 00:39:44,119
You're just another poor
little rich honky.

438
00:39:44,119 --> 00:39:47,079
No cable, no pussy, no shit.

439
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:52,719
Look man, this... this is too heavy. I don't
even know what the hell are you talking about.

440
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:55,800
- I just play games, man. Games.
- That's right.

441
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,679
It is a game.
You want to win, don't you?

442
00:39:57,679 --> 00:39:58,880
Yeah, I intent to.

443
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:01,800
Then you need to cut your
strings puppet master.

444
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:05,360
Imagine a slave that don't got
to wait to be told what to do.

445
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:07,159
No ping, you dig?

446
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:09,000
That would be cheating.

447
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,320
A mod.
That's all it would be.

448
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:15,280
You know why?
Because the game's got to evolve.

449
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:18,000
- You feel me?
- I do.

450
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:21,159
I do feel you my,
giant brother.

451
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:23,920
Well then,
let's rock baby.

452
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:34,039
Tillman...
he knows you talked to him.

453
00:40:34,920 --> 00:40:36,840
Your player.

454
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:43,119
- Who are you?
- A friend.

455
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,920
I don't have any.

456
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,880
Listen to me.

457
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:52,280
Simon is going to give you what you want.
What you asked him for.

458
00:40:54,559 --> 00:40:57,840
- How do you know that?
- I know something else.

459
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,199
Whether or not he's controlling you,

460
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:03,000
you will never reach the save point.

461
00:41:03,039 --> 00:41:04,639
Castle won't allow it.

462
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:07,320
- We'll see.
- No, you have to escape.

463
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:10,239
Your wife and your
daughter need you, Tillman.

464
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,960
If you want to get out and see
the people in the picture...

465
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:16,280
you will have to find another way.

466
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:23,480
I need you to get me something.

467
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,760
What? Tell me.

468
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:30,000
Drunk.

469
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:37,679
Kable's Last Stand

470
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:13,639
What do you go there?

471
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:15,760
Kable, what the hell is that?

472
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:25,320
Put it down.

473
00:42:26,440 --> 00:42:28,039
Put it down!

474
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:35,320
Fuck face!
Throw the bottle in the trash!

475
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:57,480
Oh, I see it was a great idea
turning you lose.

476
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,440
- What happened?
- You happened!

477
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:10,320
You wanted control,
you got it.

478
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,519
What's the matter with you, Kable?
Kill something!

479
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:50,679
This is unbelievable.

480
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:53,199
Kable, listen.
This is the last game

481
00:43:53,199 --> 00:43:56,079
you're going to end up dead and I'm
going to look like a total asshole...

482
00:43:56,079 --> 00:43:58,960
if you don't pull your balls together, man!

483
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,599
Damn it!

484
00:44:28,880 --> 00:44:30,400
Kable, what the hell are you doing?

485
00:44:39,000 --> 00:44:41,400
Aw, what the hell?

486
00:44:43,559 --> 00:44:45,760
That's just gross, bro.

487
00:45:14,719 --> 00:45:16,119
Go, go, go, go!

488
00:45:16,119 --> 00:45:19,519
I'm not your fucking cheerleader!

489
00:45:33,199 --> 00:45:35,280
Motherfucker!

490
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,519
Kable, please, please,
I beg you, get back in the game.

491
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:55,039
You're screwing my ass, Kable.

492
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,079
This is a restricted area.
Return to the battle zone.

493
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:05,639
RESTRICTED

494
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:13,320
I'm dead.

495
00:46:23,719 --> 00:46:28,400
Sweet dreams are made of these

496
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:33,119
Who am I to disagree?

497
00:46:33,119 --> 00:46:38,400
Travel the world and the seven seas

498
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:43,320
Everybody's looking for something

499
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:47,719
Some of them want to use you

500
00:46:47,719 --> 00:46:53,119
Some of them want to get used by you

501
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:58,000
Some of them want to abuse you

502
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,719
Some of them want to be abused

503
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:39,119
PLEASE STAND BY

504
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,000
What the fuck just happened?

505
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:45,599
Initial reports are that Kable,

506
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:48,440
the most recognizable face
of the Slayers phenomenon...

507
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:50,880
next to Ken Castle himself,

508
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:53,159
is officially listed as fragged.

509
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:56,400
Just one session away from being
the first Slayer ever...

510
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:59,159
to win a full pardon and release.

511
00:47:59,159 --> 00:48:02,880
And in NetCast, fledged by technical
difficulties and dead spots

512
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,039
the report could not be confirmed,

513
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:08,840
however Kable, born
John Tillman of Albany, New York

514
00:48:08,840 --> 00:48:11,360
and convicted of murder just 4 years ago,

515
00:48:11,360 --> 00:48:15,360
has been removed from Slayers
rosters and upcoming events listings.

516
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:18,079
His player, gaming mega star, Simon Silverton,

517
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:19,800
could not be reached for comment.

518
00:48:21,280 --> 00:48:22,719
Do you have a question?

519
00:48:22,719 --> 00:48:24,719
Tillman left her away for the outside, right?

520
00:48:24,719 --> 00:48:28,079
- Tillman, yeah.
- Find her.

521
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,840
Blink, activated.

522
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:33,280
She's not home.

523
00:49:33,280 --> 00:49:37,079
But Castle's personal security will be,
soon enough and trust me...

524
00:49:37,079 --> 00:49:40,239
- You don't want to meet them.
- Who are you?

525
00:49:40,239 --> 00:49:42,480
You asked me that once before

526
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:45,719
- Your voice.
- You know, you should really come with me.

527
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,320
Like now!

528
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,199
See that's why you're a fool!
That's what I'm talking about!

529
00:50:45,719 --> 00:50:49,360
Could you stop

530
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,679
Come one man, that's why
it's a game of deception, man!

531
00:50:57,519 --> 00:50:59,559
That's bullshit, man!
You know that's bullshit!

532
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:01,480
So you're the ones who broke me out?

533
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:04,159
- We only freed your mind.
- And your ass follows.

534
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:06,000
Holly shit...
You made it!

535
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:12,760
You're really here.
Kable. You're great.

536
00:51:14,599 --> 00:51:18,280
- You got questions.
- A few.

537
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,360
So she took my blood.
Why?

538
00:51:20,360 --> 00:51:22,280
The nanex.

539
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,159
It modifies the actual cell
structure of your brain.

540
00:51:25,159 --> 00:51:28,960
We can crack it, but it's not one size fits all,
we need your DNA

541
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,480
so that we can generate costume code.

542
00:51:31,480 --> 00:51:32,960
Alright, then why me?

543
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:34,639
Because Castle
is afraid of you man.

544
00:51:34,639 --> 00:51:37,679
It ain't just a game, Tillman.
Every day there's more people stepping forward.

545
00:51:37,679 --> 00:51:41,239
Want to be a part of Castle's world,
throwing away everything that means to be human.

546
00:51:41,239 --> 00:51:43,000
Right now is the desperate ones.

547
00:51:43,000 --> 00:51:47,199
Convicts, addicts, the sick, the poor.
The ones that fell through the cracks.

548
00:51:47,199 --> 00:51:49,079
The federal prison system
is growing out of control.

549
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:51,079
Set to bankrupt the whole damn USA,

550
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:53,400
then Castle rides in on a white horse

551
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:56,360
Says he has a plan to bail us all out
and we just fall in line?

552
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,920
The healthcare system is collapsing.

553
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:00,480
And this time he's pushing for
total control over genetic diseases.

554
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:02,480
Birth defect is no longer an issue.

555
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,760
All we have to do is exchange our cells
for the ones he wants to give us.

556
00:52:04,760 --> 00:52:06,679
Promise of a longer life
and a fatter wallet...

557
00:52:06,679 --> 00:52:08,599
- Do you think people will refuse?
- Fuck no.

558
00:52:08,599 --> 00:52:10,159
Then the next thing you know...

559
00:52:12,039 --> 00:52:14,079
we're all slaves.

560
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:17,480
I can't help you.

561
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,599
Tillman.
We know where she is.

562
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:25,920
Hi, Nika.

563
00:53:26,679 --> 00:53:29,639
- Oh hi. Rick Rape, right?
- Rick Rape, right?

564
00:53:31,039 --> 00:53:33,880
I thought you weren't allowed
to come here anymore.

565
00:53:39,199 --> 00:53:41,440
That was last month.
I was a bad boy.

566
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:48,880
Are you still a bad boy?

567
00:54:44,639 --> 00:54:47,480
- Please, don't kill me.
- Please, don't kill me.

568
00:54:47,480 --> 00:54:49,199
No.

569
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:53,079
- I'll do anything.
- Don't say that.

570
00:54:57,079 --> 00:54:58,400
Stop!

571
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:01,360
Stop!
Goddamn it.

572
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,599
You, in there controlling...
Let her talk!

573
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:08,440
I can't she has to say what I tell her.

574
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:11,079
You can hear me.
I know you can.

575
00:55:13,639 --> 00:55:14,920
I love you.

576
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:16,480
I love you too.

577
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:19,079
Shut up!

578
00:55:20,119 --> 00:55:23,000
Don't say anything else.
I'm going to find you...

579
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,960
and I'm going to rip you to fucking pieces,
do you understand me?

580
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:27,920
I'm getting you out of here.

581
00:55:31,760 --> 00:55:34,559
I'm going to take you to some place
where you can turn it off, the program.

582
00:55:35,639 --> 00:55:37,519
Hi Kable.

583
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:53,840
Look at me bitch!

584
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:57,639
Anybody in there?

585
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:16,920
Go on.

586
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,480
Do it.

587
00:57:17,480 --> 00:57:19,679
What the fuck do we do?

588
00:59:18,599 --> 00:59:20,440
I can get you out of here.

589
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:33,280
Oh shit!
I can't believe it's you!

590
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:38,719
This is... listen, Tillman,
you can trust me, I swear.

591
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:43,559
If not...
you're dead!

592
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:45,199
Okay.
Faster! Faster!

593
01:00:02,039 --> 01:00:03,440
I guess you remember that day, huh?

594
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:07,280
You just gotten Kable through his
10th consecutive session alive.

595
01:00:08,199 --> 01:00:10,800
No one ever thought an icon could last that long.

596
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:12,920
Pretty hot shit, aren't you?
King player.

597
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:14,760
Good times.

598
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:18,079
Sure, on the outside.
Now look at these.

599
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:22,119
That's what it's like on the inside.

600
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:25,280
Wonder how long you would last
on the other side of the screen?

601
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,519
You know, Simon...
you being held here today...

602
01:00:29,719 --> 01:00:32,559
suspected of aiding an escape
of a convicted murder

603
01:00:32,559 --> 01:00:34,800
from a maximum security penitentiary.

604
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:37,360
The charges are beyond serious.

605
01:00:39,519 --> 01:00:41,639
Your hard drives have been seized.

606
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:45,679
Forensics are depicting the content
as we speak.

607
01:00:45,679 --> 01:00:48,199
Your internet activity over
the last 10 years,

608
01:00:48,199 --> 01:00:50,760
is being scrutinized and catalogued.

609
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,400
In minute...

610
01:00:53,079 --> 01:00:54,760
vivid detail.

611
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:57,679
In addition, your father's bank
accounts have been frozen,

612
01:00:57,679 --> 01:00:59,519
pending further investigation.

613
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:04,199
After all, it was essentially his money
that funded Mr. Tillman's escape.

614
01:01:05,199 --> 01:01:06,719
Now I need you to tell me...

615
01:01:06,719 --> 01:01:10,000
everything that happened leading
up to yesterday afternoon.

616
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,480
Anybody you talked to,
everything you saw, everything you did.

617
01:01:15,519 --> 01:01:18,639
And I need you to tell me that
right now.

618
01:01:18,639 --> 01:01:20,199
Yeah, huh...

619
01:01:21,360 --> 01:01:23,599
I'm going to need something too.

620
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:29,639
Oh really?
And what might that be?

621
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:33,599
Could you guys do a sandwich like...

622
01:01:33,599 --> 01:01:36,800
peanut butter,
or almond butter, walnut butter...

623
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:39,719
huh, pecan butter, pistachio butter..

624
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:45,039
pretty much any kind of...
you know, nut butter

625
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:46,599
with some grape jelly.

626
01:01:49,480 --> 01:01:51,360
Pistachio butter.

627
01:01:51,360 --> 01:01:54,320
- They make that?
- It's awesome.

628
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,280
Now what?

629
01:02:10,280 --> 01:02:13,920
Now we just put the DNA into the suit,
light it up, extract it...

630
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,519
a few modifying sequences into the code and

631
01:02:16,519 --> 01:02:17,840
we're good to go.

632
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:20,000
- It's an anti-spyware program.
- Basically.

633
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:22,440
We can't quarantine the foreign
cells per say, but...

634
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:25,119
we can disable their ability to transmit and receive.

635
01:02:25,119 --> 01:02:27,559
Fuck that.
I'll make you cut it out me.

636
01:02:27,559 --> 01:02:29,599
That would be like cutting out
a part of your brain.

637
01:02:29,599 --> 01:02:32,320
The nanex cells replace the cells,
they replicate.

638
01:02:32,320 --> 01:02:33,880
They become you.

639
01:02:35,480 --> 01:02:38,079
We're going to have to keep her sedated
until we kill the link.

640
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:40,960
Otherwise she will be broadcasting
everything she sees and hears,

641
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,800
30 minutes.
You give us a robot...

642
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:46,119
we give you back a super hot female.

643
01:02:46,119 --> 01:02:47,719
Tillman!

644
01:02:47,719 --> 01:02:49,280
We need to talk.

645
01:02:51,079 --> 01:02:53,159
- So talk.
- Come on.

646
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:04,519
They tested on soldiers.

647
01:03:04,519 --> 01:03:07,039
The first volunteer was
the corporate Travis Scotch

648
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:09,360
a friend of yours, I believe.

649
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:11,559
And the second,
it was you.

650
01:03:16,119 --> 01:03:18,400
The idea was to replace your brain,

651
01:03:19,360 --> 01:03:21,320
bit by bit,
cell by cell.

652
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,760
The new tissue would never break down,
never deteriorate.

653
01:03:26,079 --> 01:03:29,559
A new era in human longevity, that's what they told us.

654
01:03:29,559 --> 01:03:31,599
9 weeks later Scotch was dead.

655
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:33,679
and you were serving life at maximum.

656
01:03:33,679 --> 01:03:35,320
Castle's project was shut down.

657
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:37,880
But the same technology
resurfaced within a year

658
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,119
in a game.

659
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,360
Castle called it "Society".

660
01:03:41,360 --> 01:03:45,239
Tillman, listen man, whatever happened in that
project, is something Castle wanted buried.

661
01:03:45,239 --> 01:03:48,519
We need that shit man.
What you saw, what you know.

662
01:03:50,679 --> 01:03:52,159
I don't know what to tell you.

663
01:03:52,159 --> 01:03:54,079
You gotta tell me shit.

664
01:03:54,079 --> 01:03:55,679
I want you to show me.

665
01:03:58,920 --> 01:04:01,000
Okay, we're ready to rock.
We're ready to break the link in...

666
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,679
3... 2... 1.

667
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:14,840
Who's there?

668
01:04:20,400 --> 01:04:22,239
What are you doing here?

669
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:26,360
- Who are you?
- Tech support.

670
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,920
SOCIETY
LINK FAILURE

671
01:04:37,800 --> 01:04:39,920
- What are we looking at?
- His memories.

672
01:04:39,920 --> 01:04:42,599
Translating into raw audiovisual data.

673
01:04:44,000 --> 01:04:45,639
I read something about this.

674
01:04:45,639 --> 01:04:48,599
But that tech is not supposed to be
available for another decade.

675
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:51,559
They'll have better shit than
this in Best Buy in 18 months.

676
01:04:59,719 --> 01:05:02,239
Son of a bitch!
John Tillman.

677
01:05:02,239 --> 01:05:05,679
Man I never thought I would be so
happy to see your ugly face.

678
01:05:06,719 --> 01:05:09,880
Scotch.

679
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:14,679
Is it me or is this place fucked?

680
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,760
They got me hooked up to
computers 5 hours a day.

681
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,719
Feed me vitamins, and pills,
and god knows what

682
01:05:21,719 --> 01:05:24,079
giving me injections, taking and giving me blood...

683
01:05:24,079 --> 01:05:28,280
These nurses are whipping my ass...
and there are male nurses to bro!

684
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:31,400
I can't believe I let you
talk me in to this.

685
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:35,639
And I'm having these, like, blackouts...
and is scaring the shit out of me.

686
01:05:35,639 --> 01:05:37,400
I don't even know how long I've been here

687
01:05:40,239 --> 01:05:42,400
Hey man...

688
01:05:44,360 --> 01:05:46,519
Are they letting you out already,
you son of a bitch?

689
01:05:48,719 --> 01:05:50,559
I'm not getting out.

690
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:52,159
Okay.

691
01:05:56,440 --> 01:05:58,639
Johnny...
Are you good?

692
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:01,559
I'm fine.

693
01:06:01,559 --> 01:06:03,280
Man you don't look fine.

694
01:06:05,760 --> 01:06:07,039
I'm sorry.

695
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:08,599
Yeah that's okay.

696
01:06:09,840 --> 01:06:12,159
It's not like you ever been that
good in the first place.

697
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:20,920
What's the gun for, John?

698
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,480
What's happening?

699
01:06:23,679 --> 01:06:26,039
Really you're scaring me man.
What's the gun for?

700
01:06:26,039 --> 01:06:27,440
I can't st...

701
01:06:27,440 --> 01:06:29,239
I can't stop.

702
01:06:29,239 --> 01:06:31,639
Stop what?
What did they do to you man?

703
01:06:34,239 --> 01:06:36,440
John, stop it! You're scaring me now.
Stop it.

704
01:06:36,440 --> 01:06:38,000
Sorry Scotch, I...

705
01:06:39,280 --> 01:06:40,840
John, no! Don't!
Stop!

706
01:06:52,800 --> 01:06:55,079
Not the best commercial for Ken Castle.

707
01:06:55,079 --> 01:06:56,440
They made them do it.

708
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:58,320
- Castle made them do it.
- It was a test.

709
01:06:58,320 --> 01:06:59,440
Touching.

710
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,280
Excuse me,
media whore.

711
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,079
This isn't just a story.

712
01:07:03,079 --> 01:07:05,079
The whole world is splitting down the middle.

713
01:07:05,079 --> 01:07:07,400
Sooner or later,
everyone is going to have to take a side,

714
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,960
even scavengers like you!

715
01:07:47,400 --> 01:07:49,079
It's you.

716
01:07:56,360 --> 01:07:58,480
I missed you, so much!

717
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,679
You are the reason I held on.

718
01:08:05,639 --> 01:08:08,079
- I love you.
- Where's our daughter?

719
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:15,639
I couldn't stop them. I'm sorry.

720
01:08:15,639 --> 01:08:17,800
Nobody could.

721
01:08:17,800 --> 01:08:21,279
The foster parents paid good money
to remain anonymous.

722
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:23,800
But there's always a data trail
if you know where to look.

723
01:08:23,800 --> 01:08:25,119
Where is she?

724
01:08:25,119 --> 01:08:26,600
I'm sorry, Tillman.

725
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:28,479
She's with Castle.

726
01:08:44,159 --> 01:08:45,720
Tillman!

727
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,800
That's all the story
you're going to get.

728
01:09:02,520 --> 01:09:04,079
Silverton, get up.

729
01:09:06,279 --> 01:09:08,399
What's going on man?

730
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:11,600
Looks like someone up the chain
has decided you're no longer a threat.

731
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:22,039
CHEATER

732
01:09:22,039 --> 01:09:24,439
FUCK YOU CHEATER!

733
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:34,600
NANEX
ACCESS DENIED

734
01:09:39,159 --> 01:09:40,840
We'll find him.

735
01:09:41,920 --> 01:09:43,479
Don't worry.

736
01:09:44,119 --> 01:09:45,760
We'll come to us.

737
01:09:47,439 --> 01:09:50,479
KABLE, THE FALLEN HERO OF SLAYER
REST IN PEACE

738
01:10:58,159 --> 01:11:00,800
- Not bad for a video, huh?
- What?

739
01:11:00,800 --> 01:11:04,239
The latest and greatest, I defy you
to tell it from real life...

740
01:11:04,239 --> 01:11:06,000
could you imagine porn on this thing?

741
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:51,479
I've got you under my skin

742
01:11:51,479 --> 01:11:57,479
I've got you deep
in the heart of me.

743
01:11:58,000 --> 01:12:00,319
So deep in my heart

744
01:12:00,359 --> 01:12:04,199
that you're really a part of me

745
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:10,359
I've got you under my skin

746
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:15,079
I'd tried so not to give in

747
01:12:17,119 --> 01:12:22,239
I said to myself:
this affair never will go so well

748
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:29,039
But why should I try to resist
when, baby, I know so well

749
01:12:29,039 --> 01:12:35,039
I've got you...

750
01:12:36,279 --> 01:12:38,159
under my skin.

751
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,920
I'd sacrifice anything come what might

752
01:12:42,920 --> 01:12:46,199
For the sake of havin' you near.

753
01:12:46,199 --> 01:12:49,960
In spite of a warnin'
voice that comes in the night

754
01:12:49,960 --> 01:12:53,119
And repeats, repeats in my ear...

755
01:12:53,119 --> 01:12:58,960
Don't you know, little
fool, you never can win?

756
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:04,960
Use your mentality,
wake up to reality.

757
01:13:05,479 --> 01:13:10,640
But each time that I do
just the thought of you

758
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:13,000
Makes me stop before I begin

759
01:13:13,000 --> 01:13:16,680
'Cause I've got you under my skin

760
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:24,119
under my skin.

761
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:29,399
You're awesome!

762
01:13:29,399 --> 01:13:30,720
Castle.

763
01:13:30,720 --> 01:13:32,279
Kable.

764
01:13:33,520 --> 01:13:34,960
I don't care about you.

765
01:13:34,960 --> 01:13:37,239
You just want your little
sugar pie, I know.

766
01:13:37,239 --> 01:13:38,840
So don't do anything stupid.

767
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:41,119
My house, my rules.

768
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:43,720
Come on, I want to show you something

769
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,479
I wanted to thank you for
leading me into them,

770
01:13:52,479 --> 01:13:54,920
the Humanzuz's cell, that is.

771
01:13:56,279 --> 01:13:59,079
Of course sooner or later they
would be whistling my tune

772
01:13:59,079 --> 01:14:00,800
just like everybody else, but...

773
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:04,039
Meantime, there's that little cracker
program they dreamed of that got my attention.

774
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:06,079
That was a genuine disuse, no doubt about it

775
01:14:06,079 --> 01:14:08,279
One thing even they didn't know, though,

776
01:14:08,279 --> 01:14:10,319
I'm wired too.

777
01:14:10,319 --> 01:14:15,239
I replaced 98% of my own noodle
with nano-tissue years ago.

778
01:14:15,239 --> 01:14:18,640
But mine's different.
It's built to send,

779
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:21,960
to transmit,

780
01:14:21,960 --> 01:14:24,319
whereas every other nano-cell
that I've put out there,

781
01:14:24,319 --> 01:14:27,159
including the ones
in your head Kable,

782
01:14:27,159 --> 01:14:29,359
are designed to receive.

783
01:14:29,359 --> 01:14:31,920
I think it, you do it.

784
01:14:39,399 --> 01:14:42,199
We're talking every Slayer,
everyone in Society city.

785
01:14:42,199 --> 01:14:44,640
I believe your better half would
fall under that category,

786
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:47,199
provided they were within
range of my transmitters.

787
01:14:47,199 --> 01:14:50,560
Very nice, Castle. So you got
an army of psychotics

788
01:14:50,560 --> 01:14:52,880
and deviants to dance around for you?

789
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:58,119
You're thinking small, Kable.
But not as small as me.

790
01:14:58,119 --> 01:15:00,319
See, nano-cells are real small.

791
01:15:00,319 --> 01:15:03,760
A thousand times smaller than
these dust particulars.

792
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:07,119
You inhale it. They go to work;
replicating, spreading

793
01:15:07,119 --> 01:15:10,039
like a virus, multiplying
in exponentials.

794
01:15:10,039 --> 01:15:13,359
Six months time, I can have a
hundred million people converted.

795
01:15:13,359 --> 01:15:15,920
Ditch diggers, porn stars,
and presidents.

796
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:17,279
Not one would be the wiser.

797
01:15:17,279 --> 01:15:20,199
A hundred million people who buy
what I want them to buy,

798
01:15:20,199 --> 01:15:22,279
vote how I want them to vote,

799
01:15:22,279 --> 01:15:25,880
do pretty much damn well anything
I figure they ought to do.

800
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,119
For instance...

801
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:05,319
You should have let him
fight for himself.

802
01:16:06,479 --> 01:16:08,119
Maybe you would've had a shot.

803
01:16:08,119 --> 01:16:11,199
- I think you're missing the point, my man.
- No no, I get it.

804
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:12,640
You're pulling all the strings around here.

805
01:16:12,640 --> 01:16:15,199
Which makes my next move pretty...

806
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:19,000
Neglected to mention my smart boys reversed

807
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,239
that crack the Humanz worked for you.

808
01:16:21,239 --> 01:16:24,000
Easy breezy once I had access to their drives.

809
01:16:33,479 --> 01:16:37,039
You're mine boy.

810
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:55,680
Come one, let's boogey wooguey
rock n' roll.

811
01:17:02,840 --> 01:17:05,720
I think that badass Slayer of the game
don't seem like much, does he?

812
01:17:13,439 --> 01:17:15,000
Lucky shot

813
01:17:17,279 --> 01:17:18,840
Not really.

814
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:32,840
I need an audience
boys...

815
01:17:49,640 --> 01:17:55,199
No no no, you crawl...
on your belly like a toad.

816
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:57,399
Is this bad?
I'm really bad.

817
01:17:58,000 --> 01:17:59,960
Is this bad?
I'm really bad.

818
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:08,239
That's sweet.

819
01:18:10,920 --> 01:18:14,439
Alright boys are you ready?
It's time for a true test.

820
01:18:15,399 --> 01:18:18,159
Just like last time, remember?

821
01:18:20,840 --> 01:18:23,720
Yeah, you're stronger now,
a little more fighting...

822
01:18:23,720 --> 01:18:26,600
But I think the end result
will be just about the same.

823
01:18:45,399 --> 01:18:46,800
What the hell was that?

824
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:49,239
Someone from the outside
is sending him commands...

825
01:18:49,239 --> 01:18:51,239
We're being broadcast live.

826
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:54,680
Jam the signal!

827
01:18:55,680 --> 01:18:57,119
Goddamn retards!

828
01:18:57,119 --> 01:18:58,680
We're working on it...

829
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:01,880
I think it,

830
01:19:02,399 --> 01:19:04,800
You... fucking... do it...

831
01:19:13,359 --> 01:19:15,359
Look at this knife...

832
01:19:15,359 --> 01:19:17,359
imagine me sticking it into your gut.

833
01:19:18,880 --> 01:19:22,239
Think about it...
make it real!

834
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,560
Yes!

835
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:18,600
- Are you okay?
- Are you my daddy, Tillman?

836
01:20:21,119 --> 01:20:22,680
I'm your daddy.

837
01:20:27,560 --> 01:20:29,119
Wait.

838
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:32,640
- Shut it off.
- Pardon?

839
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:34,640
The nanex.

840
01:20:35,600 --> 01:20:39,159
It's nothing to you.
Just a mouse click.

841
01:20:39,159 --> 01:20:40,680
Set us free.

842
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:47,000
Well played, Kable.
