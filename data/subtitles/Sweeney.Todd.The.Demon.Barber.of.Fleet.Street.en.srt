2
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,812
I have sailed the world

3
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:54,691
Beheld its wonders

4
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:58,986
From the Dardanelles
To the mountains of Peru

5
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:03,324
But there's no place like London

6
00:04:03,492 --> 00:04:07,579
No, there's no place like London

7
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:09,830
Mr. Todd?

8
00:04:09,998 --> 00:04:14,836
You are young
Life has been kind to you

9
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:22,970
You will learn

10
00:04:36,942 --> 00:04:39,026
There's a hole in the world
Like a great black pit

11
00:04:39,237 --> 00:04:41,028
And the vermin of the world inhabit it

12
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:43,281
And its morals aren't worth
What a pig could spit

13
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:45,658
And it goes by the name of London

14
00:04:46,827 --> 00:04:48,870
At the top of the hole
Sit a privileged few

15
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,038
Making mock of the vermin
In the lower zoo

16
00:04:51,206 --> 00:04:53,875
Turning beauty into filth and greed
I too

17
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:58,297
Have sailed the world
And seen its wonders

18
00:04:58,463 --> 00:05:02,884
For the cruelty of men
Is as wondrous as Peru

19
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:08,639
But there's no place like London

20
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,742
Is everything all right, Mr. Todd?

21
00:05:29,036 --> 00:05:31,747
I beg your indulgence, Anthony.

22
00:05:31,913 --> 00:05:34,707
My mind is far from easy.

23
00:05:36,084 --> 00:05:40,088
In these once-familiar streets,
I feel shadows...

24
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,425
- ...everywhere.
- Shadows?

25
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:46,386
Ghosts.

26
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,437
There was a barber and his wife

27
00:05:56,605 --> 00:05:59,733
And she was beautiful

28
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:03,944
A foolish barber and his wife

29
00:06:04,112 --> 00:06:07,199
She was his reason and his life

30
00:06:07,367 --> 00:06:10,951
And she was beautiful

31
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:15,790
And she was virtuous

32
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:20,045
And he was

33
00:06:21,963 --> 00:06:25,634
Naive

34
00:06:33,141 --> 00:06:36,228
There was another man who saw

35
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:39,980
That she was beautiful

36
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:43,735
A pious vulture of the law

37
00:06:43,985 --> 00:06:46,904
Who, with a gesture of his claw

38
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:50,742
Removed the barber from his plate

39
00:06:50,992 --> 00:06:55,413
Then there was nothing but to wait

40
00:06:55,747 --> 00:06:57,499
And she would fall

41
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,002
So soft, so young, so lost

42
00:07:01,170 --> 00:07:06,425
And, oh, so beautiful

43
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:11,512
And the lady, sir, did she succumb?

44
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:16,016
Oh, that was many years ago

45
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:23,524
I doubt if anyone would know

46
00:07:32,159 --> 00:07:33,869
I'd like to thank you, Anthony.

47
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:39,165
If you hadn't spotted me,
I'd be lost on the ocean still.

48
00:07:39,332 --> 00:07:40,500
Will I see you again?

49
00:07:42,377 --> 00:07:45,004
You might find me if you like.

50
00:07:46,548 --> 00:07:48,425
Around Fleet Street,
I wouldn't wonder.

51
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,221
Until then, my friend.

52
00:08:03,357 --> 00:08:05,399
There's a hole in the world
Like a great black pit

53
00:08:05,468 --> 00:08:07,668
And it's filled with people
Who are filled with shit

54
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:10,404
And the vermin of the world inhabit it

55
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,110
A customer!

56
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,519
Wait! What's your rush?

57
00:09:06,586 --> 00:09:07,528
What's your hurry?

58
00:09:07,596 --> 00:09:09,730
You gave me such a fright
I thought you was a ghost!

59
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:12,424
Half a minute, can't you sit?
Sit you down. Sit!

60
00:09:12,592 --> 00:09:14,970
All I meant is that I haven't
Seen a customer for weeks

61
00:09:15,136 --> 00:09:17,471
Did you come here for a pie, sir?

62
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:19,724
Do forgive me
If me head's a little vague

63
00:09:19,933 --> 00:09:20,975
What is that?

64
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:24,604
But you'd think we had the plague
From the way that people keep avoiding

65
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:25,813
No, you don't.

66
00:09:25,981 --> 00:09:27,524
Heaven knows I try, sir

67
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:30,568
But there's no one
Comes in even to inhale

68
00:09:30,945 --> 00:09:33,738
Right you are, sir
Would you like a drop of ale?

69
00:09:33,905 --> 00:09:36,950
Mind you, I can hardly blame them

70
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:41,037
These are probably
The worst pies in London

71
00:09:41,746 --> 00:09:44,164
I know why nobody cares to take them

72
00:09:44,332 --> 00:09:47,586
I should know, I make 'em
But good? No

73
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,171
The worst pies in London

74
00:09:50,673 --> 00:09:54,426
Even that's polite
The worst pies in London

75
00:09:54,677 --> 00:09:56,802
If you doubt it, take a bite

76
00:09:58,556 --> 00:10:03,183
Is that just disgusting?
You have to concede it

77
00:10:03,351 --> 00:10:05,102
It's nothing but crusting

78
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:11,025
Here, drink this, you'll need it
The worst pies in London

79
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:14,696
And no wonder, with the price of meat
What it is, when you get it

80
00:10:14,864 --> 00:10:17,698
Never thought I'd live to see the day
Men'd think it was a treat

81
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,201
Findin' poor animals
What are dyin' in the street

82
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,830
Mrs. Mooney has a pie shop

83
00:10:24,039 --> 00:10:26,206
Does a business
But I noticed something weird

84
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,168
Lately all her neighbors' cats
Have disappeared

85
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:32,004
Have to hand it to her
What I calls enterprise

86
00:10:32,213 --> 00:10:33,840
Poppin' pussies into pies

87
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,216
Wouldn't do in my shop

88
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,886
Just the thought of it's
Enough to make you sick

89
00:10:39,096 --> 00:10:41,181
And I'm tellin' you
Them pussycats is quick

90
00:10:42,015 --> 00:10:45,059
No denying times is hard, sir

91
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,855
Even harder than
The worst pies in London

92
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:53,067
Only lard and nothing more
Is that just revolting?

93
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:55,403
All greasy and gritty

94
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:57,364
It looks like it's molting

95
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,407
And tastes like

96
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:04,162
Well, pity A woman alone

97
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,416
With limited wind

98
00:11:08,625 --> 00:11:13,754
And the worst pies in London

99
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:18,509
Ah, sir, times is hard

100
00:11:19,052 --> 00:11:24,014
Times is hard

101
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:31,730
Trust me, dearie, it's gonna take a lot
more than ale to wash that taste out.

102
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:35,527
Come with me.
We'll get you a nice tumbler of gin, eh?

103
00:11:48,206 --> 00:11:49,415
LOVETT: Isn't this homey, now?

104
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,293
The cheery wallpaper
was a real bargain too.

105
00:11:53,461 --> 00:11:56,880
It was only partly singed when the
chapel burned down. There you go.

106
00:11:57,549 --> 00:11:59,591
You sit down, warm your bones.

107
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:02,971
You got a room over the shop here.

108
00:12:03,221 --> 00:12:05,306
Times is so hard,
why don't you rent it out?

109
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:09,184
What, up there?
No, no one will go near it.

110
00:12:10,687 --> 00:12:12,062
People think it's haunted.

111
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:16,650
- Haunted?
- Yeah.

112
00:12:16,985 --> 00:12:19,320
And who's to say they're wrong?

113
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:23,073
You see, years ago,
something happened up there.

114
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:26,201
Something not very nice.

115
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:32,125
There was a barber and his wige

116
00:12:33,001 --> 00:12:35,794
And he was beautiful

117
00:12:36,629 --> 00:12:39,423
A proper artist with a knife

118
00:12:40,091 --> 00:12:43,260
But they transported him for life

119
00:12:43,428 --> 00:12:46,847
And he was beautiful

120
00:12:48,642 --> 00:12:52,312
Barker, his name was.
Benjamin Barker.

121
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:55,648
What was his crime?

122
00:12:55,857 --> 00:12:57,524
Foolishness.

123
00:12:58,693 --> 00:13:01,028
He had this wife, you see

124
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,447
Pretty little thing, silly little nit

125
00:13:03,615 --> 00:13:07,451
Had her chance
For the moon on a string

126
00:13:07,952 --> 00:13:09,952
Poor thing

127
00:13:15,543 --> 00:13:17,796
There was this judge, you see

128
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:21,716
Wanted her like mad
Every day he sent her a flower

129
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,885
But did she come down
From her tower?

130
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:28,764
Sat up there
And sobbed by the hour

131
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,308
Poor fool

132
00:13:31,476 --> 00:13:34,979
Ah, but there was worse yet to come
Poor thing

133
00:13:41,736 --> 00:13:44,905
Well, beadle calls on her, all polite

134
00:13:45,073 --> 00:13:48,076
Poor thing, poor thing

135
00:13:48,409 --> 00:13:51,412
The judge, he tells her, is all contrite

136
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:54,749
He blames himselg
For her dreadful plight

137
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:58,211
She must come straight
To his house tonight

138
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,047
Poor thing, poor thing

139
00:14:05,927 --> 00:14:08,929
Of course, when she goes there
Poor thing, poor thing

140
00:14:09,097 --> 00:14:11,932
They're having this ball all in masks

141
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:15,102
There's no one she knows there
Poor dear, poor thing

142
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:18,355
She wanders, tormented, and drinks
Poor thing

143
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:21,567
The judge has repented, she thinks
Poor thing

144
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:24,445
"Oh, where is Judge Turpin?" she asks

145
00:14:25,822 --> 00:14:29,116
He was there, all right
Only not so contrite

146
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,956
She wasn't no match gor such craft
You see

147
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:37,875
And everyone thought it so droll

148
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,794
They figured she had to be daft
You see

149
00:14:40,962 --> 00:14:43,881
So all of them stood there and laughed
You see

150
00:14:44,048 --> 00:14:45,133
Poor soul

151
00:14:46,759 --> 00:14:48,595
Poor thing

152
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,562
SWEENEY: No!

153
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,859
Would no one have mercy on her?

154
00:15:03,568 --> 00:15:06,153
So it is you...

155
00:15:06,363 --> 00:15:08,072
...Benjamin Barker.

156
00:15:09,616 --> 00:15:11,868
Where is Lucy?

157
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,162
Where is my wife?

158
00:15:14,996 --> 00:15:17,624
She poisoned herself.

159
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:21,919
Arsenic, from the apothecary
around the corner.

160
00:15:22,086 --> 00:15:25,505
I tried to stop her,
but she wouldn't listen to me.

161
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:31,178
And he's got your daughter.

162
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:35,015
He?

163
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,601
Judge Turpin?

164
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:42,190
Adopted her. Like his own.

165
00:15:43,775 --> 00:15:45,442
Fifteen years...

166
00:15:46,361 --> 00:15:50,865
...sweating in a living hell
on a false charge.

167
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:56,370
Fifteen years dreaming I might
come home to a wife and child.

168
00:15:57,956 --> 00:16:01,333
I can't say the years have been
particularly kind to you, Mr. Barker.

169
00:16:01,501 --> 00:16:03,711
No. Not Barker.

170
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:06,380
That man is dead.

171
00:16:07,966 --> 00:16:12,220
It's Todd now. Sweeney Todd.

172
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:15,347
And he will have his revenge.

173
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,880
Come in.

174
00:16:49,966 --> 00:16:51,926
Nothing to be afraid of, love.

175
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:41,433
When they came for the girl,
I hid them.

176
00:17:42,769 --> 00:17:44,895
Could've sold them, but I didn't.

177
00:17:56,825 --> 00:17:59,326
Those handles is chased silver,
ain't they?

178
00:18:01,454 --> 00:18:04,749
Silver. Yes.

179
00:18:13,842 --> 00:18:17,678
These are my friends

180
00:18:18,638 --> 00:18:22,767
See how they glisten

181
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:27,313
See this one shine

182
00:18:27,647 --> 00:18:32,109
How he smiles in the light

183
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:35,529
My friend

184
00:18:35,697 --> 00:18:40,284
My faithful friend

185
00:18:42,703 --> 00:18:46,374
Speak to me, friend

186
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:51,295
Whisper, I'll listen

187
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,298
I know, I know

188
00:18:55,467 --> 00:19:02,640
You've been locked out of sight
All these years

189
00:19:02,807 --> 00:19:06,894
Like me, my friend

190
00:19:07,061 --> 00:19:11,190
Well, I've come home

191
00:19:11,357 --> 00:19:16,153
To find you waiting

192
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:19,240
Home

193
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:23,869
And we're together

194
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:28,749
And we'll do wonders

195
00:19:30,001 --> 00:19:32,502
Won't we?

196
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,923
You there, my friend

197
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:39,926
- I'm your friend too, Mr. Todd
- Come, let me hold you

198
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:43,263
- If you only knew, Mr. Todd
- Now, with a sigh

199
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:48,394
- Oh, Mr. Todd, you're warm in my hand
- You grow warm in my hand

200
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:51,564
- My friend
- You've come home

201
00:19:51,731 --> 00:19:58,237
- My clever friend
- Always had a fondness for you, I did

202
00:19:58,404 --> 00:20:01,115
Rest now, my friends

203
00:20:01,282 --> 00:20:05,243
- Never you fear, Mr. Todd
- Soon I'll unfold you

204
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:08,288
- You can move in here, Mr. Todd
- Soon you'll know

205
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:12,792
- Splendors you never have dreamed
- Splendors you never have dreamed

206
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:16,631
- All your days
- All your days will be yours

207
00:20:16,798 --> 00:20:19,299
My lucky friends

208
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:23,386
- I'm your friend and now you're mine
- Till now your shine

209
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:27,642
- Don't they shine beautiful?
- Was merely silver

210
00:20:27,808 --> 00:20:32,771
- Silver's good enough for me, Mr. T.
- Friends

211
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:37,234
You shall drip rubies

212
00:20:37,818 --> 00:20:39,653
You'll soon drip

213
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:46,410
Precious rubies

214
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,627
Leave me.

215
00:21:08,474 --> 00:21:10,684
At last...

216
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:14,020
...my arm is complete again.

217
00:22:14,790 --> 00:22:16,916
Greenfinch and linnet bird

218
00:22:17,085 --> 00:22:18,919
Nightingale, blackbird

219
00:22:19,086 --> 00:22:22,423
How is it you sing?

220
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:27,428
How can you jubilate
Sitting in cages

221
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,847
Never taking wing?

222
00:22:31,682 --> 00:22:36,269
Outside, the sky waits
Beckoning, beckoning

223
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:39,690
Just beyond the bars

224
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:44,069
How can you remain
Staring at the rain

225
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:48,324
Maddened by the stars?

226
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:54,079
How is it you sing anything?

227
00:22:54,247 --> 00:22:58,875
How is it you sing?

228
00:23:12,223 --> 00:23:16,394
My cage has many rooms
Damask and dark

229
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:21,816
Nothing there sings
Not even my lark

230
00:23:21,982 --> 00:23:26,444
Larks never will, you know
When they're captive

231
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:32,367
Teach me to be more adaptive

232
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:41,292
Greenfinch and linnet bird
Nightingale, blackbird

233
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:45,256
Teach me how to sing

234
00:23:46,007 --> 00:23:51,302
If I cannot fly

235
00:23:51,971 --> 00:23:53,971
Let me sing

236
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,656
BEGGAR WOMAN: Alms

237
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:17,413
Alms gor a miserable woman

238
00:24:18,205 --> 00:24:24,502
On a miserable chilly morning

239
00:24:26,338 --> 00:24:27,839
Thank you, sir!

240
00:24:28,008 --> 00:24:31,343
Ma'am? Could you tell me
whose house this is?

241
00:24:32,052 --> 00:24:35,806
Uh, that's the great
Judge Turpin's house, that is.

242
00:24:36,223 --> 00:24:38,349
And the young lady who resides there?

243
00:24:38,727 --> 00:24:40,560
Oh, that's Johanna...

244
00:24:40,936 --> 00:24:42,813
...his pretty little ward.

245
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:46,066
Keeps her snug, he does.
All locked up.

246
00:24:46,984 --> 00:24:49,153
So don't you go trespassing there...

247
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:51,572
...or it's a good whipping for you...

248
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:55,576
...or any other young man
with mischief on his mind.

249
00:24:56,577 --> 00:24:57,994
Alms

250
00:24:58,163 --> 00:25:03,750
Alms for a desperate woman

251
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,647
I feel you, Johanna

252
00:25:16,263 --> 00:25:20,558
I feel you

253
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:24,270
I was half convinced I'd waken

254
00:25:24,689 --> 00:25:28,776
Satisfied enough to dream you

255
00:25:28,943 --> 00:25:35,950
Happily I was mistaken, Johanna

256
00:25:36,116 --> 00:25:38,717
I'll steal you, Johanna

257
00:25:44,125 --> 00:25:48,796
I'll steal you

258
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:05,395
Come in, lad. Come in.

259
00:26:12,319 --> 00:26:14,989
You were looking for Hyde Park,
you say?

260
00:26:15,155 --> 00:26:16,490
Yes.

261
00:26:16,657 --> 00:26:20,286
It's very large on the map,
but I keep getting lost.

262
00:26:20,452 --> 00:26:22,997
Sit down, lad, sit down.

263
00:26:23,163 --> 00:26:28,669
It's embarrassing for a sailor to lose
his bearings, but, uh, there you are.

264
00:26:32,464 --> 00:26:34,299
A sailor?

265
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:37,845
Yes, sir.
The Bountiful, out of Plymouth.

266
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:41,973
A sailor must know
the ways of the world, yes?

267
00:26:42,808 --> 00:26:46,185
Must be practiced
in the ways of the world.

268
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:48,521
Would you say
you were practiced, boy?

269
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:49,940
Sir?

270
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:53,109
Oh, yes.

271
00:26:53,486 --> 00:26:57,698
Such practices.

272
00:26:58,157 --> 00:27:02,327
The geishas of Japan.
The concubines of Siam.

273
00:27:02,494 --> 00:27:07,665
The catamites of Greece.
The harlots of India.

274
00:27:08,667 --> 00:27:12,337
I have them all here.
Drawings of them.

275
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:16,549
Everything you've ever
dreamed of doing...

276
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,093
...with a woman.

277
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:21,680
Would you like to see?

278
00:27:22,222 --> 00:27:24,182
I think there's been some mistake.

279
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:27,102
I think not.

280
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:32,231
You gandered at my ward, Johanna.

281
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,734
You gandered at her.

282
00:27:34,903 --> 00:27:38,989
- Yes, sir, you gandered.
- I meant no harm.

283
00:27:39,156 --> 00:27:41,741
Your meaning is immaterial.

284
00:27:42,493 --> 00:27:43,618
Mark me.

285
00:27:44,244 --> 00:27:47,538
If I see your face
again on this street...

286
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:52,001
...you'll rue the day you were born.

287
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,590
BEADLE:
Hyde Park is that way, young sir!

288
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,719
A left and a right and straight on,
you see?

289
00:28:00,886 --> 00:28:01,929
Move on, now!

290
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:15,275
You heard what Judge Turpin said,
little man.

291
00:28:15,777 --> 00:28:20,948
Next time, it'll be your pretty little brains
all over the pavement.

292
00:28:44,972 --> 00:28:47,573
I'll steal you, Johanna

293
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:57,317
I'll steal you

294
00:28:57,484 --> 00:29:00,988
Do they think that walls can hide you?

295
00:29:01,321 --> 00:29:05,159
Even now I'm at your window

296
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:09,954
I am in the dark beside you

297
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:17,837
Buried sweetly in your yellow hair

298
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:29,432
I feel you, Johanna

299
00:29:29,601 --> 00:29:37,601
And one day I'll steal you

300
00:29:38,276 --> 00:29:42,028
Till I'm with you then
I'm with you there

301
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:50,363
Sweetly buried in your yellow hair

302
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:13,894
He's here every Thursday.
Italian. All the rage, he is.

303
00:30:14,061 --> 00:30:17,064
Best barber in London, they say.

304
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:49,596
Hang on.

305
00:31:21,253 --> 00:31:22,546
Ladies and gentlemen

306
00:31:22,713 --> 00:31:25,132
May I have your attention, please?

307
00:31:26,384 --> 00:31:28,259
Do you wake every morning
In shame and despair

308
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:31,471
To discover your pillow
Is covered with hair?

309
00:31:31,638 --> 00:31:33,640
What ought not to be there

310
00:31:33,807 --> 00:31:37,352
Well, ladies and gentlemen
From now on, you can waken at ease

311
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,645
You need never again
Have a worry or care

312
00:31:39,855 --> 00:31:42,316
I will show you
A miracle marvelous rare

313
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:48,488
Gentlemen, you are about to see
Something what rose from the dead

314
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,615
On the top of my head

315
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:57,122
'Twas Pirelli's Miracle Elixir

316
00:31:57,289 --> 00:32:00,666
That's what did the trick, sir
True, sir, true

317
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:04,171
Was it quick, sir?
Did it in a tick, sir

318
00:32:04,338 --> 00:32:07,382
Just like an elixir
Ought to do

319
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:09,800
How about a bottle, mister?

320
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,386
Only costs a penny, guaranteed

321
00:32:15,098 --> 00:32:18,518
Does Pirelli's
Stimulate the growth, sir?

322
00:32:18,685 --> 00:32:22,146
You can have my oath, sir
'Tis unique

323
00:32:22,315 --> 00:32:25,651
Rub a minute
Stimulatin', innit?

324
00:32:25,817 --> 00:32:29,363
Soon you'll have to thin it
Once a week

325
00:32:29,529 --> 00:32:31,265
Pardon me, ma'am
What's that awful stench?

326
00:32:31,267 --> 00:32:33,085
LOVETT:
Are we standing near an open trench?

327
00:32:33,086 --> 00:32:35,864
- Must be standing near an open trench
- Pardon me, what's that awful stench?

328
00:32:35,865 --> 00:32:38,166
Buy Pirelli's Miracle Elixir

329
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:41,833
Anything what's slick, sir
Soon sprouts curls

330
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,336
Try Pirelli's
When they see how thick, sir

331
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:49,173
You can have your pick, sir
Of the girls

332
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,467
Wanna buy a bottle, missus?

333
00:32:50,634 --> 00:32:52,219
- What is this?
- What is this?

334
00:32:52,386 --> 00:32:54,270
- Smells like piss
- Smells like... Ew!

335
00:32:54,272 --> 00:32:56,748
SWEENEY: Looks like piss
- Wouldn't touch it if I was you, dear

336
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:57,916
This is piss Piss with ink

337
00:32:58,058 --> 00:32:59,893
Let Pirelli's activate your roots, sir

338
00:32:59,894 --> 00:33:01,795
Keep it off your boots, sir
Eats right through

339
00:33:01,797 --> 00:33:04,758
Yes, get Pirelli's, use a bottle of it
Ladies seem to love it

340
00:33:04,856 --> 00:33:06,023
Flies do too

341
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:11,238
I am Adolfo Pirelli

342
00:33:11,405 --> 00:33:13,406
The king of the barbers
The barber of kings

343
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:16,826
E buon giorno, good day
I blow you a kiss

344
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,538
And I

345
00:33:19,705 --> 00:33:21,414
The so-famous Pirelli
I wish to know

346
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:24,584
Who has the nerve to say

347
00:33:24,751 --> 00:33:27,045
My elixir is piss

348
00:33:27,755 --> 00:33:29,839
Who says this?

349
00:33:32,551 --> 00:33:33,593
I do.

350
00:33:35,971 --> 00:33:38,597
I'm Mr. Sweeney Todd of Fleet Street.

351
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,184
I've opened a bottle of Pirelli's Elixir.

352
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:47,106
And I say to you that
it is nothing but an arrant fraud...

353
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:50,443
...concocted from piss and ink.

354
00:33:51,028 --> 00:33:52,695
Furthermore, signor...

355
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:55,949
...I have serviced no kings...

356
00:33:56,116 --> 00:34:00,037
...yet I wager that I can shave a cheek
with 10 times more dexterity...

357
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:03,248
...than any street mountebank.

358
00:34:08,128 --> 00:34:09,420
Do you see these razors?

359
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,550
I lay them against 5 pound...

360
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:16,762
...you are no match, sir.

361
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:19,764
Either accept my challenge...

362
00:34:19,931 --> 00:34:22,266
...or reveal yourself as a sham.

363
00:34:23,894 --> 00:34:26,021
You hear this foolish man?

364
00:34:26,646 --> 00:34:32,402
Now, please, you will see how
he will regret his folly.

365
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,820
Toby!

366
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,072
Who's for a free shave?

367
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:01,431
Will Beadle Bamford be the judge?

368
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:07,646
Glad, as always,
to oblige my friends and neighbors.

369
00:35:17,614 --> 00:35:21,159
- Ready?
- Ready.

370
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,786
Ready.

371
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:28,375
The fastest, smoothest shave
is the winner!

372
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,067
Now, signorine, signori

373
00:35:54,235 --> 00:35:55,318
We mix the lather

374
00:35:55,485 --> 00:35:58,070
But first you gather around
Signorine, signori

375
00:35:58,239 --> 00:35:59,322
You looking a man

376
00:35:59,489 --> 00:36:01,324
Who have had the glory
To shave the pope

377
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,659
Mr. Sweeney, whoever
I beg your pardon

378
00:36:03,827 --> 00:36:07,079
You'll probably say it was only a cardinal
Nope!

379
00:36:07,748 --> 00:36:09,373
It was the pope!

380
00:36:12,335 --> 00:36:16,590
To shave the face
To cut the hair

381
00:36:17,007 --> 00:36:21,844
Require the grace
Require the flair

382
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,556
For if you slip
You nick the skin

383
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:28,643
You clip the chin
You rip the lip a bit beyond repair

384
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,355
To shave the face

385
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:37,527
Or even a part
Without it smart

386
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:40,405
Require the heart

387
00:36:40,572 --> 00:36:43,115
Not just the flash

388
00:36:43,284 --> 00:36:48,246
It take panache
It take the passion for the art

389
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:55,628
To shave the face
To trim the beard

390
00:36:55,795 --> 00:37:00,090
To make the bristle
Clean like a whistle

391
00:37:00,259 --> 00:37:06,264
This is from early infancy
The talent give to me

392
00:37:06,431 --> 00:37:08,032
By God

393
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:16,690
It take the skill
It take the brains

394
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:23,322
It take the will
To take the pains

395
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:25,742
It take the pace

396
00:37:25,909 --> 00:37:28,510
It take the grace

397
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:41,173
The winner is Todd!

398
00:37:52,143 --> 00:37:56,523
Sir, I bow to a skill
far greater than my own.

399
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,942
The 5 pound.

400
00:38:05,365 --> 00:38:08,367
May the good Lord smile on you...

401
00:38:09,369 --> 00:38:11,871
...until we meet again.

402
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:13,956
Come, boy. Come!

403
00:38:23,509 --> 00:38:28,221
I suppose it's just me gentle heart, but
I do hate to see a boy treated like that.

404
00:38:28,389 --> 00:38:30,639
MAN:
Congratulations, Mr. Todd.

405
00:38:31,057 --> 00:38:33,893
May I ask you, sir,
do you have your own establishment?

406
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,394
He certainly does.

407
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:40,900
Sweeney Todd's Tonsorial Parlor, above
my Meat Pie Emporium in Fleet Street.

408
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:46,572
SWEENEY: I thank you, sir.

409
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:49,409
You are a paragon of integrity.

410
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:54,039
Well, I try to do my best
for my friends and neighbors.

411
00:38:54,831 --> 00:38:58,251
Your establishment is in Fleet Street,
you say?

412
00:38:58,418 --> 00:38:59,585
Yes, sir.

413
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:05,425
Then, Mr. Todd, you shall surely
see me there before the week is out.

414
00:39:05,675 --> 00:39:07,677
You will be welcome, Beadle Bamford.

415
00:39:08,429 --> 00:39:12,431
And I can guarantee to give you,
without a penny's charge...

416
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:15,351
...the closest shave you will ever know.

417
00:39:25,945 --> 00:39:28,114
Come on, love.

418
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:51,155
It's not much of a chair, but it'll do.
It was me poor Albert's chair.

419
00:40:51,322 --> 00:40:55,159
Sit in it all day long he did,
after his leg gave out with the gout.

420
00:40:55,327 --> 00:40:57,286
Why doesn't the beadle come?

421
00:40:57,496 --> 00:41:00,498
"Before the week is out,"
that's what he said.

422
00:41:00,666 --> 00:41:03,918
Well, who says the week's out?
It's only Tuesday.

423
00:41:08,173 --> 00:41:10,382
Easy, now

424
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,677
Hush, love, hush

425
00:41:12,844 --> 00:41:17,056
Don't distress yourself
What's your rush?

426
00:41:17,224 --> 00:41:21,478
Keep your thoughts
Nice and lush

427
00:41:21,644 --> 00:41:23,146
Wait

428
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:30,235
Hush, love, hush
Think it through

429
00:41:30,445 --> 00:41:34,532
Once it bubbles
Then what's to do?

430
00:41:34,699 --> 00:41:38,702
Watch it close Let it brew

431
00:41:38,871 --> 00:41:39,913
Wait

432
00:41:41,956 --> 00:41:44,541
I've been thinking flowers

433
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:49,172
Maybe daisies
To brighten up the room

434
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:55,219
Don't you think some flowers
Pretty daisies

435
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:57,972
Might relieve the gloom?

436
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:00,974
Ah, wait

437
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:04,353
Love, wait

438
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,981
And the judge?
When'll we get to him?

439
00:42:08,858 --> 00:42:10,443
LOVETT:
Can't you think of nothing else?

440
00:42:10,610 --> 00:42:12,277
Always brooding away
on your wrongs...

441
00:42:12,445 --> 00:42:16,532
...and what happened heaven knows
how many years ago. Come on.

442
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:21,579
Slow, love, slow
Time's so fast

443
00:42:21,746 --> 00:42:25,875
Now goes quickly
See, now it's passed

444
00:42:26,043 --> 00:42:30,045
Soon will come Soon will last

445
00:42:30,213 --> 00:42:31,463
Wait

446
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:38,554
Don't you know Silly man

447
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:42,809
Half the fun
Is to plan the plan?

448
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:47,146
All good things
Come to those who can

449
00:42:47,313 --> 00:42:50,608
Wait

450
00:42:51,568 --> 00:42:56,280
Gillyflowers, maybe
'Stead of daisies

451
00:42:56,447 --> 00:43:00,827
I don't know, though
What do you think?

452
00:43:10,670 --> 00:43:12,422
Oh, I'm sorry, excuse me.

453
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:13,922
Mrs. Lovett, sir.

454
00:43:14,090 --> 00:43:15,592
A pleasure, ma'am.

455
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,094
Mr. Todd, there's a girl
who needs my help.

456
00:43:18,262 --> 00:43:20,429
Such a sad girl and lonely,
but beautiful too.

457
00:43:20,597 --> 00:43:24,976
- Slow down, son.
- Yes. I'm sorry.

458
00:43:25,143 --> 00:43:27,144
This girl's guardian
keeps her locked away...

459
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:29,355
...but then this morning
she dropped this.

460
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:31,858
Surely a sign that Johanna
wants me to help her.

461
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:35,027
That's her name, Johanna.
And Turpin is her guardian.

462
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:39,032
He's a judge of some sort. Once he
goes to court, I'll slip into the house...

463
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:41,659
...release her and beg her
to come away with me.

464
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:44,704
- Oh, this is very romantic.
- Yes.

465
00:43:44,871 --> 00:43:46,956
But I don't know anyone
in London, you see.

466
00:43:47,123 --> 00:43:51,043
And I need somewhere safe to bring her
till I've hired a coach to take us away.

467
00:43:51,210 --> 00:43:55,715
If I could keep her here just for an hour
or two, I'd be forever in your debt.

468
00:43:59,302 --> 00:44:00,887
Bring her here, love.

469
00:44:01,554 --> 00:44:03,556
Thank you, ma'am.

470
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:05,599
Mr. Todd?

471
00:44:07,393 --> 00:44:11,188
Oh, thank you. Thank you, thank you,
my friend. Thank you, ma'am.

472
00:44:14,025 --> 00:44:17,362
Seems like the Fates
are favoring you at last, Mr. T.

473
00:44:17,528 --> 00:44:18,905
SWEENEY: Hm.

474
00:44:19,072 --> 00:44:22,909
What is it? You'll have her back
before the day's out.

475
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,746
- What about him?
- Him?

476
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:29,414
Oh, well. Let him bring her here.

477
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:32,751
And then, since you're
so hot for a little:

478
00:44:33,711 --> 00:44:36,130
That's the throat to slit, my dear.

479
00:44:37,925 --> 00:44:39,759
Poor little Johanna.

480
00:44:39,927 --> 00:44:42,594
All those years without
a scrap of motherly affection.

481
00:44:44,056 --> 00:44:47,724
Well, I'll soon see to that.

482
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:59,277
LOVETT:
Hello. What's he doing here?

483
00:45:00,405 --> 00:45:03,115
Keep the boy downstairs.

484
00:45:13,793 --> 00:45:16,420
Signora, is Mr. Todd at home?

485
00:45:16,588 --> 00:45:18,715
Plying his trade upstairs.

486
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:21,217
Ooh. Would you look at it, now?

487
00:45:21,385 --> 00:45:24,052
You wouldn't mind if I gave it
a nice, juicy meat pie, would you?

488
00:45:24,304 --> 00:45:25,804
Sì, sì, sì. Whatever you want.

489
00:45:26,889 --> 00:45:28,141
Come on, lad.

490
00:45:28,474 --> 00:45:30,893
Your teeth are strong, I hope.

491
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:34,063
Close the door.

492
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,898
Get you a nice, lovely pie.

493
00:45:38,693 --> 00:45:41,612
Sit down. Make yourself comfy.

494
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:50,413
Come in.

495
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:00,172
Mr. Todd.

496
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,715
Signor Pirelli.

497
00:46:03,135 --> 00:46:05,094
Call me Davey.

498
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:08,847
Davey Collins is the name
when it's not professional.

499
00:46:10,224 --> 00:46:12,351
I'd like me 5 quid back,
if you don't mind.

500
00:46:12,518 --> 00:46:13,643
Why?

501
00:46:13,811 --> 00:46:17,606
Because you entered into our little wager
under false pretenses, my friend.

502
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:22,360
So that you might remember to be
a bit more forthright in the future...

503
00:46:22,862 --> 00:46:27,115
...I'll be taking half your profits
from herewith. Share and share alike.

504
00:46:28,367 --> 00:46:30,786
Mr. Benjamin Barker.

505
00:46:33,289 --> 00:46:34,623
There we are.

506
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,335
Tuck in.

507
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:44,634
I like to see a man with a healthy
appetite. Reminds me of my dear Albert.

508
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:48,971
Liked to gorge himself
to bloatation, he did.

509
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:51,766
He didn't have your nice
head of hair, though.

510
00:46:52,059 --> 00:46:56,353
To tell the truth, it gets awful hot.

511
00:46:59,398 --> 00:47:01,650
Yes, this'll do nicely.

512
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:06,864
You don't remember me, do you?

513
00:47:07,282 --> 00:47:08,907
Why should you?

514
00:47:09,076 --> 00:47:13,079
I was just a little nipper you hired for
a couple of weeks, sweeping up hair.

515
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:16,833
But I remember these.

516
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,168
And how could I ever
forget you, Mr. Barker?

517
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:27,009
I used to sit right here...

518
00:47:27,177 --> 00:47:30,054
...and dream of the day when I could be
a proper barber myself.

519
00:47:30,429 --> 00:47:34,182
You might say that you was
inspiration to me.

520
00:47:46,445 --> 00:47:48,197
So has we got a deal?

521
00:47:49,699 --> 00:47:54,619
Or should I run down the street
to me old pal, Beadle Bamford?

522
00:47:57,373 --> 00:47:59,125
What do you say to that now...

523
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:01,126
...Mr. Sweeney Todd?

524
00:48:24,150 --> 00:48:27,235
My, my, my. Always work to be done.

525
00:48:27,403 --> 00:48:29,655
Spic and span, that's my motto.

526
00:48:42,418 --> 00:48:45,670
So, um, how'd you end up
with that dreadful Italian?

527
00:48:45,838 --> 00:48:50,175
Got me from the workhouse.
Been there since I was born.

528
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:54,597
Oh, God. He's got an appointment with
his tailor. If he's late, he'll blame me.

529
00:48:54,764 --> 00:48:56,139
Wait!

530
00:49:02,648 --> 00:49:05,523
Signor, you've got an appointment.

531
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:12,447
Signor Pirelli's been called away.

532
00:49:12,615 --> 00:49:13,949
Better run after him.

533
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:19,538
No, sir. I should stay here,
or it'll be a lashing.

534
00:49:19,706 --> 00:49:22,208
He's a great one for the lashings.

535
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:32,885
So Mrs. Lovett give you a pie, did she?

536
00:49:33,052 --> 00:49:34,679
She's a real lady.

537
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,681
That she is.

538
00:49:42,061 --> 00:49:47,065
But if I know a growing boy,
there's still room for more pie, eh?

539
00:49:47,233 --> 00:49:48,943
Yes, sir.

540
00:49:50,195 --> 00:49:52,737
Then why don't you wait
for your master downstairs?

541
00:49:52,905 --> 00:49:54,990
Be another pie in it for you, I'm sure.

542
00:49:55,157 --> 00:49:57,242
No. I should stay here.

543
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,079
Tell you what.

544
00:50:01,581 --> 00:50:03,541
Why don't you tell Mrs. Lovett...

545
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:06,668
...that I said to give you
a nice, big tot of gin?

546
00:50:07,253 --> 00:50:08,378
Thank you, sir!

547
00:51:16,947 --> 00:51:19,282
TURPIN:
This is the second time, sir...

548
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:22,452
...you have been brought
before this bench.

549
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:28,333
Though it is my earnest wish
ever to temper justice with mercy...

550
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:31,170
...your persistent dedication
to a life of crime...

551
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:34,798
...is an abomination
before God and man.

552
00:51:34,965 --> 00:51:38,302
I therefore sentence you to hang
by the neck until you're dead...

553
00:51:38,469 --> 00:51:40,804
...and may the Lord
have mercy on your soul.

554
00:51:42,516 --> 00:51:44,141
Court is adjourned.

555
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:57,862
Thank you, Your Honor.
Just the sentence we wanted.

556
00:51:58,030 --> 00:51:59,447
Was he guilty?

557
00:51:59,615 --> 00:52:03,284
Well, if he didn't do it, he's surely
done something to warrant a hanging.

558
00:52:03,452 --> 00:52:05,036
What man has not?

559
00:52:05,204 --> 00:52:06,871
Sorry?

560
00:52:08,875 --> 00:52:10,668
No matter. Come.

561
00:52:11,878 --> 00:52:13,503
Walk home with me.

562
00:52:16,590 --> 00:52:19,385
I have news for you, my friend.

563
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:22,346
In order to shield her
from the evils of this world...

564
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:25,224
...I have decided to marry
my dear Johanna.

565
00:52:25,391 --> 00:52:28,351
Oh, sir, happy news indeed.

566
00:52:28,519 --> 00:52:30,396
Strange, though.

567
00:52:30,563 --> 00:52:34,900
When I offered myself to her,
she showed a certain...

568
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,527
...reluctance.

569
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:38,403
Excuse me, my lord

570
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,864
May I request, my lord

571
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:41,907
Permission, my lord, to speak?

572
00:52:42,409 --> 00:52:44,409
Forgive me if I suggest, my lord

573
00:52:44,577 --> 00:52:47,579
You're looking less than your best
My lord

574
00:52:47,746 --> 00:52:52,501
There's powder upon your vest, my lord
And stubble upon your cheek

575
00:52:55,172 --> 00:52:59,382
And ladies, my lord, are weak

576
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:03,052
Stubble, you say?

577
00:53:05,556 --> 00:53:08,434
Well, perhaps I am a little
overhasty in the mornings.

578
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:12,563
Fret not, though, my lord
I know a place, my lord

579
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:15,273
A barber, my lord, of skill

580
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:19,945
Thus armed with a shaven face, my lord
Some eau de cologne to brace, my lord

581
00:53:20,155 --> 00:53:25,117
And musk to enhance the chase, my lord
You'll dazzle the girl until

582
00:53:26,452 --> 00:53:28,411
Until?

583
00:53:28,579 --> 00:53:32,875
She bows to your every will

584
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:35,210
A barber?

585
00:53:36,045 --> 00:53:37,213
Take me to him.

586
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:42,927
His name is Todd, my lord, and he is
the very last word in barbering.

587
00:53:48,557 --> 00:53:51,768
You ought to slow down a bit, lad.
It'll go straight to your head.

588
00:53:51,936 --> 00:53:54,980
They used to give it to us
in the workhouse so's we could sleep.

589
00:53:55,606 --> 00:53:57,900
Not that you'd wanna sleep
in that place, ma'am.

590
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,235
Not with the things
what happened in the dark.

591
00:54:00,402 --> 00:54:03,739
That's nice, dear. Think I'll just
pop in on Mr. Todd for a tick.

592
00:54:03,907 --> 00:54:05,074
You all right there?

593
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,742
Leave the bottle.

594
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:14,791
Ooh, that lad is drinking me
out of house and home.

595
00:54:16,168 --> 00:54:17,961
How long till Pirelli gets back?

596
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,797
He won't be back.

597
00:54:22,675 --> 00:54:25,010
Mr. T, you didn't.

598
00:54:35,813 --> 00:54:37,273
You're barking mad.

599
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:40,025
Killing a man what done you no harm.

600
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:42,193
He recognized me from the old days.

601
00:54:42,778 --> 00:54:43,987
Tried to blackmail me.

602
00:54:45,364 --> 00:54:46,824
Half me earnings.

603
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:51,202
Oh, well.
That's a different matter, then.

604
00:54:51,371 --> 00:54:54,498
For a moment there,
I thought you'd lost your marbles.

605
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,210
Ew. All that blood.

606
00:55:01,047 --> 00:55:03,007
Poor bugger.

607
00:55:03,507 --> 00:55:04,800
Oh, well.

608
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:15,351
Well, waste not, want not.

609
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:21,817
So, um, what are we gonna do
about the boy, then?

610
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,152
Send him up.

611
00:55:24,403 --> 00:55:27,364
Oh, we don't need to worry about him.
He's a simple thing.

612
00:55:27,532 --> 00:55:28,574
Send him up!

613
00:55:32,077 --> 00:55:35,581
Now, Mr. T,
surely one's enough for today.

614
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:40,085
Besides, I was thinking of hiring the lad
to help me around the shop.

615
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:42,338
Me poor knees
aren't what they used to be.

616
00:55:44,090 --> 00:55:45,548
All right.

617
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:52,264
Of course, we're gonna have to stock up
on the gin. Boy drinks like a sailor.

618
00:55:56,101 --> 00:55:57,561
The judge.

619
00:56:00,856 --> 00:56:02,358
Get out.

620
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:06,195
Get out!

621
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,545
Mr. Todd?

622
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:26,465
At your service.

623
00:56:27,132 --> 00:56:30,719
An honor to receive
your patronage, milord.

624
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:33,097
You know me, sir?

625
00:56:33,889 --> 00:56:39,061
Who in this wide world
does not know the great Judge Turpin?

626
00:56:45,610 --> 00:56:49,237
These premises are hardly prepossessing,
and yet the beadle tells me...

627
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:53,992
...you're the most accomplished
of all the barbers in the city.

628
00:56:54,159 --> 00:56:56,869
That is gracious of him, sir.

629
00:56:57,496 --> 00:57:00,164
What may I do for you today, sir?

630
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:03,460
A stylish trimming of the hair?

631
00:57:03,628 --> 00:57:05,503
Soothing skin massage?

632
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,338
Sit, sir. Sit.

633
00:57:08,465 --> 00:57:11,175
You see, sir, a man infatuate with love

634
00:57:11,385 --> 00:57:13,387
Her ardent and eager slave

635
00:57:13,762 --> 00:57:18,516
So fetch the pomade and pumice stone
And lend me a more seductive tone

636
00:57:18,684 --> 00:57:23,188
A sprinkling, perhaps, of French cologne
But first, sir, I think

637
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:26,692
A shave

638
00:57:28,610 --> 00:57:32,405
The closest I ever gave

639
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:38,704
You're in a merry mood today,
Mr. Todd.

640
00:57:38,871 --> 00:57:43,876
'Tis your delight, sir, catching fire
From one man to the next

641
00:57:44,043 --> 00:57:48,880
'Tis true, sir, love can still inspire
The blood to pound, the heart leap higher

642
00:57:49,047 --> 00:57:51,717
- What more can man require?
- What more can man require?

643
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:54,219
- Than love, sir?
- More than love, sir

644
00:57:54,429 --> 00:57:55,554
- What, sir?
- Women

645
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:57,972
- Ah, yes, women
- Pretty women

646
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:33,050
Now, then, my friend

647
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:38,387
Now to your purpose

648
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:43,268
Patience, enjoy it

649
00:58:43,894 --> 00:58:48,898
- Revenge can't be taken in haste
- Make haste

650
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,985
- And if we wed you'll be commended, sir
- My lord

651
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:57,282
And who, may it be said
Is your intended, sir?

652
00:58:57,449 --> 00:58:59,909
My ward

653
00:59:01,036 --> 00:59:03,454
And pretty as a rosebud.

654
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:05,706
Pretty as her mother?

655
00:59:06,458 --> 00:59:08,960
What? What was that?

656
00:59:09,128 --> 00:59:11,295
Nothing, sir. Nothing.

657
00:59:11,505 --> 00:59:13,632
May we proceed?

658
00:59:15,092 --> 00:59:16,134
Pretty women

659
00:59:17,302 --> 00:59:19,096
Fascinating

660
00:59:19,972 --> 00:59:21,806
Sipping coffee

661
00:59:22,809 --> 00:59:24,934
Dancing

662
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:29,606
Pretty women are a wonder

663
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,317
Pretty women

664
00:59:35,612 --> 00:59:39,657
Sitting in the window

665
00:59:39,826 --> 00:59:44,829
Or standing on the stair

666
00:59:45,539 --> 00:59:53,539
Something in them
Cheers the air

667
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,342
Pretty women

668
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:00,177
Silhouetted

669
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:03,097
Stay within you

670
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:06,143
Glancing

671
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,144
Stay forever

672
01:00:08,605 --> 01:00:10,771
Breathing lightly

673
01:00:11,356 --> 01:00:13,442
Pretty women

674
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,277
- Pretty women
- Pretty women

675
01:00:16,153 --> 01:00:20,032
- Blowing out their candles
- Blowing out their candles

676
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:23,994
- Or combing out their hair
- Combing out their hair

677
01:00:24,161 --> 01:00:25,536
Then they leave

678
01:00:25,704 --> 01:00:29,541
- Even when they leave
- Even when they leave you and vanish

679
01:00:29,708 --> 01:00:32,543
- They somehow can still remain
- They still

680
01:00:32,711 --> 01:00:37,465
- There with you, there with you
- Are there, they're there

681
01:00:37,634 --> 01:00:39,134
- Pretty women
- Pretty women

682
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:41,010
- At their mirrors
- In their gardens

683
01:00:41,179 --> 01:00:43,347
- Letter-writing, weather-watching
- Flower-picking

684
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:48,893
- How they make a man sing
- How they make a man sing

685
01:00:49,061 --> 01:00:51,146
- Proof of heaven
- Proof of heaven

686
01:00:51,313 --> 01:00:53,565
- As you're living
- As you're living

687
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:56,025
- Pretty women, sir!
- Pretty women, sir!

688
01:00:56,193 --> 01:00:58,235
- Pretty women, yes!
- Pretty women, yes!

689
01:00:58,403 --> 01:00:59,695
- Pretty women
- Pretty women

690
01:00:59,864 --> 01:01:01,907
- All the pretty women
- Pretty women

691
01:01:02,074 --> 01:01:05,534
Mr. Todd! I've seen Johanna and she
said she'd leave with me tonight.

692
01:01:08,246 --> 01:01:09,914
You.

693
01:01:10,083 --> 01:01:14,335
There is indeed a higher power,
to warn me thus in time.

694
01:01:14,503 --> 01:01:16,588
Johanna, elope with you?

695
01:01:18,048 --> 01:01:22,760
I'll make sure neither you nor any other
man shall ever set eyes on her again.

696
01:01:23,262 --> 01:01:27,224
As for you, barber, it's all too clear
what company you keep.

697
01:01:27,391 --> 01:01:31,603
Service them well and hold their custom,
for you'll have none of mine.

698
01:01:31,771 --> 01:01:33,355
ANTHONY:
Mr. Todd, you have to help me.

699
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:34,606
- Out.
- Mr. Todd, please.

700
01:01:34,773 --> 01:01:36,733
- Out. Out!
- Mr. Todd!

701
01:01:42,782 --> 01:01:44,949
All this shouting and running about.
What's happened?

702
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:46,617
I had him.

703
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:49,538
The sailor busted in.
I saw them running down the stairs.

704
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:50,871
I had him!

705
01:01:51,039 --> 01:01:52,958
His throat was bare beneath my hand

706
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:55,960
- There, there, dear. Calm down.
- No, I had him!

707
01:01:56,128 --> 01:01:58,963
His throat was there
And he'll never come again

708
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,757
Easy, now Hush, love, hush

709
01:02:01,925 --> 01:02:03,050
I keep telling you...

710
01:02:03,219 --> 01:02:05,094
- When?
- What's your rush?

711
01:02:05,262 --> 01:02:07,139
Why did I wait?
You told me to wait

712
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:09,432
Now he'll never come again

713
01:02:12,277 --> 01:02:14,271
There's a hole in the world
Like a great black pit

714
01:02:14,273 --> 01:02:16,382
And it's filled with people
Who are filled with shit

715
01:02:16,384 --> 01:02:19,302
And the vermin of the world inhabit it

716
01:02:20,193 --> 01:02:23,447
But not for long

717
01:02:25,449 --> 01:02:29,411
They all deserve to die

718
01:02:29,996 --> 01:02:33,664
Tell you why, Mrs. Lovett
Tell you why

719
01:02:34,333 --> 01:02:37,001
Because in all of the whole human race
Mrs. Lovett

720
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:39,170
There are two kinds of men
And only two

721
01:02:39,338 --> 01:02:41,672
There's the one staying put
In his proper place

722
01:02:41,840 --> 01:02:44,175
And the one with his foot
In the other one's face

723
01:02:44,342 --> 01:02:46,260
Look at me, Mrs. Lovett, look at you

724
01:02:46,429 --> 01:02:50,474
No, we all deserve to die

725
01:02:50,974 --> 01:02:54,769
Even you, Mrs. Lovett, even I

726
01:02:55,521 --> 01:02:58,481
Because the lives of the wicked
Should be made brief

727
01:02:58,648 --> 01:03:00,525
For the rest of us
Death will be a relief

728
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:04,612
We all deserve to die

729
01:03:05,030 --> 01:03:11,036
And I'll never see Johanna

730
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:17,458
No, I'll never hug my girl to me

731
01:03:17,626 --> 01:03:19,043
Finished!

732
01:03:20,378 --> 01:03:24,382
All right!
You, sir, how about a shave?

733
01:03:24,550 --> 01:03:28,135
Come and visit
Your good friend Sweeney

734
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:31,056
You, sir, too, sir
Welcome to the grave

735
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:34,643
I will have vengeance

736
01:03:35,561 --> 01:03:41,065
I will have salvation

737
01:03:42,275 --> 01:03:46,028
Who, sir? You, sir?
No one's in the chair, come on, come on

738
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:49,865
Sweeney's waiting
I want you bleeders

739
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:53,202
You, sir. Anybody!
Gentlemen, now, don't be shy

740
01:03:53,371 --> 01:03:59,000
Not one man, no, nor 10 men

741
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:05,715
Nor a hundred can assuage me

742
01:04:05,882 --> 01:04:08,592
I will have you

743
01:04:10,429 --> 01:04:13,597
And I will get him back
Even as he gloats

744
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:17,059
In the meantime
I'll practice on less honorable throats

745
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:23,440
And my Lucy lies in ashes

746
01:04:23,608 --> 01:04:29,905
And I'll never see my girl again

747
01:04:30,532 --> 01:04:33,952
But the work waits

748
01:04:35,121 --> 01:04:38,039
I'm alive at last

749
01:04:38,583 --> 01:04:44,545
And I'm full of joy

750
01:04:51,204 --> 01:04:53,496
That's all very well,
but what are we gonna do about him?

751
01:04:58,476 --> 01:05:00,061
Hello?

752
01:05:03,356 --> 01:05:04,481
Do you hear me?

753
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:09,737
Come on.

754
01:05:09,905 --> 01:05:12,740
Oh, you great useless thing.

755
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:20,498
Sit down.

756
01:05:40,311 --> 01:05:42,686
There. Drink it down.

757
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:47,858
Now, we got a body
moldering away upstairs.

758
01:05:48,027 --> 01:05:50,695
Now, what do you intend
we should do about that, then?

759
01:05:50,987 --> 01:05:53,197
Later on, when it's dark...

760
01:05:53,365 --> 01:05:56,201
...we'll take it to some secret place
and bury it.

761
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:59,411
Oh, yeah. Of course we could do that.

762
01:06:02,416 --> 01:06:05,835
Don't suppose he's got any relatives
gonna come looking for him.

763
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:13,802
Seems a downright shame

764
01:06:14,177 --> 01:06:15,219
Shame?

765
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:20,057
Seems an awful waste

766
01:06:21,643 --> 01:06:25,563
Such a nice, plump frame
What's-his-name has

767
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:28,400
Had, has

768
01:06:28,567 --> 01:06:31,152
Nor he can't be traced

769
01:06:32,320 --> 01:06:35,155
Business needs a lift

770
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:38,534
Debts to be erased

771
01:06:39,369 --> 01:06:42,246
Think of it as thrift, as a gift

772
01:06:42,914 --> 01:06:44,373
If you get my drift

773
01:06:46,085 --> 01:06:49,586
Seems an awful waste

774
01:06:51,215 --> 01:06:54,592
I mean, with the price of meat
What it is

775
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,177
When you get it, if you get it

776
01:06:57,346 --> 01:06:58,387
Ahh.

777
01:06:58,556 --> 01:06:59,597
Good, you got it

778
01:06:59,764 --> 01:07:03,184
Take, for instance
Mrs. Mooney and her pie shop

779
01:07:03,768 --> 01:07:07,105
Business never better
Using only pussycats and toast

780
01:07:08,273 --> 01:07:11,800
Now, a pussy's good for maybe
Six or seven at the most

781
01:07:11,869 --> 01:07:13,802
And I'm sure they can't compare
As far as taste

782
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:16,447
- Mrs. Lovett, what a charming notion
- It does seem a waste

783
01:07:16,614 --> 01:07:18,949
Eminently practical and yet appropriate
As always

784
01:07:19,117 --> 01:07:22,619
Mrs. Lovett, how I've lived without you
All these years I'll never know

785
01:07:22,788 --> 01:07:26,248
Lots of other gentlemen'll soon be
Coming for a shave, won't they?

786
01:07:26,416 --> 01:07:28,585
- Think of all them pies
- How choice, how rare

787
01:07:28,753 --> 01:07:32,130
For what's the sound of the world
Out there?

788
01:07:32,297 --> 01:07:35,090
What, Mr. Todd, what, Mr. Todd?
What is that sound?

789
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:38,802
Those crunching noises
Pervading the air

790
01:07:38,971 --> 01:07:41,431
Yes, Mr. Todd, yes, Mr. Todd
Yes, all around

791
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:45,434
It's man devouring man, my dear

792
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:50,315
- And who are we to deny it in here?
- And who are we to deny it in here?

793
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:55,903
These are desperate times,
Mrs. Lovett...

794
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:58,907
...and desperate measures
are called for.

795
01:07:59,909 --> 01:08:02,327
Here we are, hot out of the oven.

796
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:05,496
What is that?

797
01:08:05,664 --> 01:08:08,500
It's priest
Have a little priest

798
01:08:08,666 --> 01:08:12,170
- Is it really good?
- Sir, it's too good, at least

799
01:08:12,338 --> 01:08:15,507
Then again
They don't commit sins of the flesh

800
01:08:15,673 --> 01:08:17,132
So it's pretty fresh

801
01:08:19,511 --> 01:08:20,970
Awful lot of fat

802
01:08:21,137 --> 01:08:22,180
Only where it sat

803
01:08:22,555 --> 01:08:25,934
Haven't you got poet
Or something like that?

804
01:08:26,101 --> 01:08:30,814
No, you see, the trouble with poet
Is how do you know it's deceased?

805
01:08:31,023 --> 01:08:33,024
Try the priest

806
01:08:42,158 --> 01:08:43,368
Lawyer's rather nice

807
01:08:44,036 --> 01:08:45,787
SWEENEY: If it's for a price

808
01:08:45,954 --> 01:08:50,958
Order something else, though, to follow
Since no one should swallow it twice

809
01:08:51,127 --> 01:08:52,292
Anything that's lean?

810
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:57,465
Well, then, if you're British and loyal
You might enjoy Royal Marine

811
01:08:57,882 --> 01:08:59,384
Anyway, it's clean

812
01:08:59,551 --> 01:09:02,302
Though, of course
It tastes of wherever it's been

813
01:09:02,887 --> 01:09:06,224
Is that squire on the fire?

814
01:09:06,391 --> 01:09:10,060
Mercy, no, sir, look closer
You'll notice it's grocer

815
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:12,729
SWEENEY:
Looks thicker, more like vicar

816
01:09:12,898 --> 01:09:16,400
No, it has to be grocer
It's green

817
01:09:19,904 --> 01:09:23,533
The history of the world, my love

818
01:09:23,701 --> 01:09:26,327
Save a lot of graves
Do a lot of relatives favors

819
01:09:26,494 --> 01:09:30,247
Is those below serving those up above

820
01:09:30,416 --> 01:09:33,001
Everybody shaves
So there should be plenty of flavors

821
01:09:33,168 --> 01:09:36,253
How gratifying for once to know

822
01:09:36,421 --> 01:09:38,088
- That those above
- That those above

823
01:09:38,256 --> 01:09:41,341
- Will serve those down below
- Will serve those down below

824
01:09:48,516 --> 01:09:49,559
What is that?

825
01:09:49,726 --> 01:09:52,686
It's fop Finest in the shop

826
01:09:52,896 --> 01:09:57,149
Or we have some shepherd's pie
Peppered with actual shepherd on top

827
01:09:57,650 --> 01:09:59,277
And I've just begun

828
01:09:59,444 --> 01:10:04,114
Here's the politician, so oily
It's served with a doily, have one

829
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:05,783
Put it on a bun

830
01:10:06,284 --> 01:10:09,621
Well, you never know
If it's going to run

831
01:10:09,787 --> 01:10:12,873
Try the friar
Fried, it's drier

832
01:10:13,042 --> 01:10:16,711
No, the clergy is really
Too coarse and too mealy

833
01:10:16,878 --> 01:10:19,588
Then actor It's compacter

834
01:10:19,756 --> 01:10:22,716
Ah, but always arrives overdone

835
01:10:23,551 --> 01:10:26,470
I'll come again when you have
judge on the menu.

836
01:10:32,978 --> 01:10:36,939
Have charity towards the world
My pet

837
01:10:37,106 --> 01:10:39,775
Yes, yes, I know, my love

838
01:10:39,944 --> 01:10:42,987
We'll take the customers
That we can get

839
01:10:43,154 --> 01:10:45,823
Highborn and low, my love

840
01:10:45,990 --> 01:10:49,159
We'll not discriminate great from small

841
01:10:49,328 --> 01:10:51,453
No, we'll serve anyone

842
01:10:51,521 --> 01:10:53,096
- We'll serve anyone
- Meaning anyone

843
01:10:53,164 --> 01:11:00,587
- And to anyone at all
- And to anyone at all

844
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:17,854
So it's true.

845
01:11:18,856 --> 01:11:23,694
Sir, a gentleman knocks
before entering a lady's room.

846
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:26,530
Indeed he does, but I see no lady.

847
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:31,618
I told myself
that the sailor was lying...

848
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:36,207
...that my Johanna would never
betray me, never hurt me so.

849
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:38,876
Sir, I will leave this place.

850
01:11:40,378 --> 01:11:43,046
I think that only appropriate.

851
01:11:43,256 --> 01:11:48,176
Since you no longer find my company
to your liking...

852
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:53,307
...we shall provide you
with new lodgings.

853
01:11:55,978 --> 01:12:00,273
Until this moment,
I have spared the rod.

854
01:12:01,024 --> 01:12:05,403
But the ungrateful child
has broken my heart.

855
01:12:06,154 --> 01:12:09,907
When you've learnt to appreciate what
you have, perhaps we shall meet again.

856
01:12:10,074 --> 01:12:12,159
Until then...

857
01:12:12,869 --> 01:12:17,332
...think on your sins.

858
01:12:23,588 --> 01:12:25,213
No!

859
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:30,011
JOHANNA: No, please!

860
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:36,559
Johanna! Where are you taking her?
Tell me or I swear I'll...

861
01:12:36,726 --> 01:12:39,270
You'd kill me, boy? Here I stand!

862
01:12:41,230 --> 01:12:43,608
ANTHONY: Johanna!

863
01:13:49,006 --> 01:13:51,606
I feel you, Johanna

864
01:13:57,390 --> 01:14:01,351
I feel you

865
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:05,523
Do they think that walls can hide you?

866
01:14:05,690 --> 01:14:09,359
Even now I'm at your window

867
01:14:09,528 --> 01:14:14,114
I am in the dark beside you

868
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:19,203
Buried sweetly in your yellow hair

869
01:14:19,412 --> 01:14:21,012
Johanna

870
01:14:31,966 --> 01:14:35,386
And are you beautiful and pale

871
01:14:35,554 --> 01:14:37,387
With yellow hair, like her?

872
01:14:38,849 --> 01:14:42,059
I'd want you beautiful and pale

873
01:14:42,226 --> 01:14:44,479
The way I've dreamed you were

874
01:14:44,645 --> 01:14:49,442
- Johanna ANTHONY: Johanna

875
01:14:51,944 --> 01:14:58,074
And if you're beautiful, what then?
With yellow hair like wheat

876
01:14:58,534 --> 01:15:03,206
I think we shall not meet again
My little dove

877
01:15:03,372 --> 01:15:06,042
My sweet Johanna

878
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:12,256
I'll steal you, Johanna

879
01:15:12,466 --> 01:15:13,882
SWEENEY: Goodbye, Johanna

880
01:15:15,092 --> 01:15:18,220
You're gone, and yet you're mine

881
01:15:18,387 --> 01:15:20,765
I'm fine, Johanna

882
01:15:20,932 --> 01:15:23,533
- I'm fine
- Johanna

883
01:15:34,070 --> 01:15:40,493
Smoke! Smoke! Sign of the devil
Sign of the devil, city on fire

884
01:15:40,702 --> 01:15:45,372
Witch! Witch! Smell it, sir, an evil smell
Every night at the vespers bell

885
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:47,375
Smoke that comes from
The mouth of hell

886
01:15:47,542 --> 01:15:49,542
City on fire

887
01:15:54,507 --> 01:15:57,092
Mischief! Mischief! Mischief!

888
01:16:05,769 --> 01:16:11,524
And if I never hear your voice
My turtledove, my dear

889
01:16:12,234 --> 01:16:17,654
I still have reason to rejoice
The way ahead is clear

890
01:16:17,823 --> 01:16:19,422
Johanna

891
01:16:24,287 --> 01:16:28,291
ANTHONY: I feel you
- And in that darkness when I'm blind

892
01:16:28,457 --> 01:16:30,501
With what I can't forget

893
01:16:30,668 --> 01:16:34,630
- Johanna
- It's always morning in my mind

894
01:16:34,797 --> 01:16:37,007
My little lamb, my pet

895
01:16:37,175 --> 01:16:38,774
Johanna

896
01:16:44,265 --> 01:16:47,268
- You stay, Johanna
ANTHONY: Johanna

897
01:16:47,435 --> 01:16:50,813
The way I've dreamed you are

898
01:16:50,980 --> 01:16:55,318
Oh, look, Johanna, a star

899
01:16:55,484 --> 01:16:58,820
Buried sweetly in your yellow hair

900
01:16:58,988 --> 01:17:03,658
A shooting star

901
01:17:06,287 --> 01:17:07,704
BEGGAR WOMAN: There! There!

902
01:17:07,872 --> 01:17:10,207
Somebody, somebody
Look up there, didn't I tell you?

903
01:17:10,375 --> 01:17:14,211
Smell that air City on fire

904
01:17:14,378 --> 01:17:17,213
Quick, sir, run and tell
Warn 'em all of the witch's spell

905
01:17:17,381 --> 01:17:19,175
There it is, there it is
The unholy smell

906
01:17:19,342 --> 01:17:22,177
Tell it to the beadle and police as well
Tell 'em, tell 'em

907
01:17:22,345 --> 01:17:25,305
Help! Fiend! City on fire

908
01:17:25,474 --> 01:17:28,725
City on fire

909
01:17:28,894 --> 01:17:30,478
Mischief! Mischief!

910
01:17:40,613 --> 01:17:47,036
And though I'll think of you, I guess
Until the day I die

911
01:17:47,203 --> 01:17:49,829
I think I miss you less and less

912
01:17:49,997 --> 01:17:53,250
As every day goes by, Johanna

913
01:17:53,417 --> 01:17:55,018
Johanna

914
01:17:59,716 --> 01:18:05,387
And you'd be beautiful and pale
And look too much like her

915
01:18:06,264 --> 01:18:12,686
If only angels could prevail
We'd be the way we were, Johanna

916
01:18:12,854 --> 01:18:18,442
ANTHONY: I feel you, Johanna

917
01:18:18,944 --> 01:18:21,444
Wake up, Johanna

918
01:18:22,154 --> 01:18:25,115
Another bright red day

919
01:18:25,283 --> 01:18:32,789
We learn, Johanna, to say

920
01:18:34,208 --> 01:18:38,628
Goodbye

921
01:18:38,796 --> 01:18:45,802
ANTHONY: I'll steal

922
01:18:45,970 --> 01:18:47,570
You

923
01:19:27,578 --> 01:19:28,945
Ladies and gentlemen

924
01:19:29,014 --> 01:19:31,015
May I have your attention, please?

925
01:19:32,975 --> 01:19:35,185
Are your nostrils aquiver
And tingling as well

926
01:19:35,353 --> 01:19:38,314
At that delicate, luscious
Ambrosial smell?

927
01:19:38,481 --> 01:19:40,356
Yes, they are, I can tell

928
01:19:40,524 --> 01:19:44,194
Well, ladies and gentlemen
That aroma enriching the breeze

929
01:19:44,362 --> 01:19:46,697
Is like nothing
Compared to its succulent source

930
01:19:46,864 --> 01:19:49,658
The gourmets among you
Will tell you, of course

931
01:19:50,284 --> 01:19:55,206
Ladies and gentlemen
You can't imagine the rapture in store

932
01:19:56,248 --> 01:19:58,208
Just inside of this door

933
01:20:02,756 --> 01:20:06,216
There you'll sample
Mrs. Lovett's meat pies

934
01:20:06,384 --> 01:20:09,970
Savory and sweet pies, as you'll see

935
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:13,390
You who eat pies
Mrs. Lovett's meat pies

936
01:20:13,557 --> 01:20:16,644
Conjure up the treat
Pies used to be

937
01:20:20,564 --> 01:20:23,234
- Toby
- Coming

938
01:20:23,400 --> 01:20:25,360
- Ale there
- Right, ma'am

939
01:20:25,529 --> 01:20:27,279
LOVETT: Quick, now

940
01:20:27,988 --> 01:20:31,408
Nice to see you, dearie
How have you been keeping?

941
01:20:31,576 --> 01:20:35,412
Cor, me bones is weary
Toby, one for the gentleman

942
01:20:35,579 --> 01:20:39,082
Hear the birdies cheeping
Helps to keep it cheery

943
01:20:39,251 --> 01:20:40,917
Toby, throw the old woman out

944
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:46,256
What's my secret?
Frankly, dear, forgive my candor

945
01:20:46,423 --> 01:20:50,010
Family secret
All to do with herbs

946
01:20:50,177 --> 01:20:53,555
Things like being careful
With your coriander

947
01:20:53,722 --> 01:20:56,100
That's what makes the gravy grander

948
01:21:06,677 --> 01:21:08,712
TOBY & LOVETT:
Eat them slow and feel the crust

949
01:21:08,779 --> 01:21:10,029
How thin I rolled it

950
01:21:10,198 --> 01:21:13,576
Eat them slow
'Cause every one's a prize

951
01:21:13,743 --> 01:21:17,078
Eat them slow, 'cause that's the lot
And now we've sold it

952
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:18,622
Come again tomorrow

953
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:19,957
LOVETT: Hold it

954
01:21:20,917 --> 01:21:22,792
Bless my eyes

955
01:21:24,462 --> 01:21:26,130
Fresh supplies

956
01:21:26,338 --> 01:21:29,800
How about it, dearie?
Be there in a twinkling

957
01:21:29,967 --> 01:21:32,970
Just confirms my theory Toby

958
01:21:33,137 --> 01:21:36,974
God watches over us
Didn't have an inkling, positively eerie

959
01:21:37,141 --> 01:21:39,225
Toby, throw the old woman out

960
01:21:47,735 --> 01:21:50,445
LOVETT: Still gotta keep an eye
on household expenditure.

961
01:21:50,613 --> 01:21:52,488
SWEENEY: Mm. LOVETT: Mmm.

962
01:21:52,657 --> 01:21:55,326
Which isn't to say we couldn't get
taxidermy animals...

963
01:21:55,493 --> 01:21:57,828
...bring a touch of gentility
to the place.

964
01:21:57,996 --> 01:22:00,997
You know, a boar's head or two.

965
01:22:01,666 --> 01:22:04,667
Mr. T? You listening to me?

966
01:22:04,877 --> 01:22:05,961
Of course.

967
01:22:06,128 --> 01:22:08,296
Then what did I just say?

968
01:22:08,881 --> 01:22:11,091
There must be a way to the judge.

969
01:22:11,259 --> 01:22:14,094
Judge. Always harping
on the bloody old judge.

970
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:19,515
We got a nice, respectable business
now. Money coming in regular-like.

971
01:22:19,684 --> 01:22:21,935
And since we're careful
to pick and choose...

972
01:22:22,103 --> 01:22:24,188
...strangers,
people who won't be missed...

973
01:22:24,396 --> 01:22:26,189
...who's gonna catch on?

974
01:22:27,274 --> 01:22:29,525
Ooh, Mr. Todd, I'm so happy

975
01:22:29,694 --> 01:22:31,694
I could eat you up, I really could

976
01:22:31,904 --> 01:22:35,282
You know what I'd like to do, Mr. Todd?
What I dream?

977
01:22:35,449 --> 01:22:38,702
If the business stays as good
Where I'd really like to go

978
01:22:39,412 --> 01:22:43,707
In a year or so
Don't you wanna know?

979
01:22:43,875 --> 01:22:44,875
Of course.

980
01:22:45,042 --> 01:22:46,835
Do you really wanna know?

981
01:22:47,002 --> 01:22:49,712
Yes, I do.

982
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,521
By the sea, Mr. Todd
That's the life I covet

983
01:23:06,689 --> 01:23:09,524
By the sea, Mr. Todd
Oh, I know you'd love it

984
01:23:09,693 --> 01:23:14,904
You and me, Mr. T, we could be alone
In a house what we'd almost own

985
01:23:15,073 --> 01:23:18,199
- Down by the sea
- Anything you say

986
01:23:18,368 --> 01:23:21,537
Wouldn't that be smashing?

987
01:23:21,871 --> 01:23:23,413
LOVETT:
Think how snug it'll be

988
01:23:23,581 --> 01:23:24,914
Underneath our flannel

989
01:23:25,082 --> 01:23:28,085
When it's just you and me
And the English Channel

990
01:23:28,252 --> 01:23:30,921
In our cozy retreat
Kept all neat and tidy

991
01:23:31,088 --> 01:23:36,092
We'll have chums over every Friday
By the sea

992
01:23:36,511 --> 01:23:42,432
Don't you love the weather
By the sea?

993
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:46,228
We'll grow old together

994
01:23:46,395 --> 01:23:51,274
By the seaside
By the beautiful sea

995
01:23:55,779 --> 01:24:00,576
It'll be so quiet that who'll come by it
Except a seagull?

996
01:24:00,743 --> 01:24:01,868
Hoo! Hoo!

997
01:24:02,037 --> 01:24:06,622
We shouldn't try it, though
Till it's legal for two

998
01:24:07,751 --> 01:24:10,793
But a seaside wedding
Could be devised

999
01:24:11,003 --> 01:24:14,256
Me rumpled bedding legitimized

1000
01:24:14,423 --> 01:24:19,552
Me eyelids aflutter, I'll turn into butter
The moment I mutter "I do"

1001
01:24:19,720 --> 01:24:22,305
Do you take this woman
to be your lawfully wedded wife?

1002
01:24:27,436 --> 01:24:28,604
You may kiss your bride.

1003
01:24:41,618 --> 01:24:47,831
Down by the sea
Married nice and proper

1004
01:24:47,998 --> 01:24:53,670
By the sea
Bring along your chopper

1005
01:24:53,837 --> 01:25:00,344
To the seaside
By the beautiful sea

1006
01:25:18,363 --> 01:25:20,697
Brought you some breakfast, dear.

1007
01:25:24,828 --> 01:25:28,956
Mr. T? Can I ask you a question?

1008
01:25:29,123 --> 01:25:30,707
What?

1009
01:25:31,333 --> 01:25:34,086
What did your Lucy look like?

1010
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:39,132
Can't really remember, can you?

1011
01:25:40,385 --> 01:25:42,636
She had yellow hair.

1012
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:47,015
You gotta leave this all
behind you now.

1013
01:25:48,725 --> 01:25:50,644
She's gone.

1014
01:25:52,063 --> 01:25:54,730
Life is for the alive, my dear.

1015
01:25:55,399 --> 01:25:58,152
We could have a life, us two.

1016
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:00,863
Maybe not like I dreamed.

1017
01:26:01,405 --> 01:26:04,073
Maybe not like you remember.

1018
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:07,034
But we could get by.

1019
01:26:14,918 --> 01:26:17,753
ANTHONY:
Mr. Todd? Mrs. Lovett, ma'am?

1020
01:26:17,921 --> 01:26:19,172
What is it, Anthony?

1021
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:20,923
He has her locked in a madhouse.

1022
01:26:22,176 --> 01:26:24,427
- Johanna?
- Fogg's Asylum.

1023
01:26:24,595 --> 01:26:29,056
I've circled the place a dozen times.
There's no way in. It's a fortress.

1024
01:26:29,516 --> 01:26:30,684
I've got him.

1025
01:26:31,644 --> 01:26:32,853
ANTHONY: Mr. Todd?

1026
01:26:33,896 --> 01:26:35,521
We've got her.

1027
01:26:36,858 --> 01:26:40,777
Where do you suppose all the wigmakers
in London go to obtain their hair?

1028
01:26:41,445 --> 01:26:43,279
Bedlam.

1029
01:26:43,448 --> 01:26:45,532
They get it from the lunatics
at Bedlam.

1030
01:26:45,699 --> 01:26:46,742
I don't understand.

1031
01:26:48,953 --> 01:26:51,287
We shall set you up
as a wigmaker's apprentice.

1032
01:26:52,122 --> 01:26:55,792
That'll gain you access.
And then you take her.

1033
01:26:55,960 --> 01:26:58,045
Go, quickly, go!

1034
01:26:58,962 --> 01:27:00,046
Fetch the boy.

1035
01:27:00,465 --> 01:27:02,798
Don't you think you should
leave the boy alone?

1036
01:27:18,483 --> 01:27:21,275
Toby? Mr. Todd needs you.

1037
01:27:21,444 --> 01:27:23,237
Yes, ma'am.

1038
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:37,333
Mr. T?

1039
01:27:39,420 --> 01:27:41,337
Do you know where the Old Bailey is?

1040
01:27:41,506 --> 01:27:43,506
Yes, sir. Not that I ever been there.

1041
01:27:43,675 --> 01:27:47,636
Take this there.
Seek out a Judge Turpin. Repeat that.

1042
01:27:47,804 --> 01:27:50,180
Go to Old Bailey. Find Judge Turpin.

1043
01:27:50,347 --> 01:27:53,809
You put that into his hands.
Only to him, you understand?

1044
01:27:53,976 --> 01:27:57,270
Yes, sir. While I'm out, do you mind
if I stop by the grocer...?

1045
01:27:57,438 --> 01:28:00,148
No. You're not to stop.
You're not to speak.

1046
01:28:00,315 --> 01:28:02,859
You're to deliver the letter.
Do you understand?

1047
01:28:03,027 --> 01:28:04,694
Yes, sir.

1048
01:28:34,559 --> 01:28:35,975
Where you been, lad?

1049
01:28:36,144 --> 01:28:40,314
We had quite the rush at dinnertime.
Me poor bones is ready to drop.

1050
01:28:41,024 --> 01:28:43,233
Mr. Todd sent me on an errand.

1051
01:28:43,400 --> 01:28:47,738
And on the way back, I went by
the workhouse, just to take a look.

1052
01:28:47,904 --> 01:28:51,073
And I was thinking,
but for you, I'd be there now.

1053
01:28:51,701 --> 01:28:53,827
- Hm.
- Or someplace worse.

1054
01:28:53,994 --> 01:28:56,037
Seems like the good Lord
sent you for me.

1055
01:28:56,413 --> 01:28:59,666
Oh, love, I feel quite the same way.

1056
01:28:59,833 --> 01:29:04,046
Listen to me, please. Do you know
there's nothing I wouldn't do for you?

1057
01:29:04,212 --> 01:29:08,091
Say, if there were someone around...

1058
01:29:08,259 --> 01:29:09,801
...someone bad.

1059
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:12,929
Only, you didn't know it.

1060
01:29:13,096 --> 01:29:16,432
What is this?
What are you talking about?

1061
01:29:19,061 --> 01:29:22,396
Nothing's gonna harm you

1062
01:29:22,564 --> 01:29:25,442
Not while I'm around

1063
01:29:26,944 --> 01:29:32,573
Nothing's gonna harm you
No, sir, not while I'm around

1064
01:29:32,742 --> 01:29:34,242
What do you mean,
"someone bad"?

1065
01:29:34,409 --> 01:29:41,291
Demons are prowling everywhere
Nowadays

1066
01:29:41,458 --> 01:29:47,631
I'll send 'em howling, I don't care
I got ways

1067
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:52,219
Hush, darling.
There's no need for this.

1068
01:29:53,930 --> 01:30:00,101
No one's gonna hurt you
No one's gonna dare

1069
01:30:01,729 --> 01:30:07,109
Others can desert you
Not to worry, whistle, I'll be there

1070
01:30:07,902 --> 01:30:11,822
Demons'll charm you with a smile

1071
01:30:11,988 --> 01:30:17,661
For a while, but in time

1072
01:30:17,869 --> 01:30:21,163
Nothing can harm you

1073
01:30:21,373 --> 01:30:27,170
Not while I'm around

1074
01:30:30,425 --> 01:30:32,509
That's nice, dear.

1075
01:30:32,676 --> 01:30:38,014
Now, what is all this foolishness?
What are you talking about?

1076
01:30:38,181 --> 01:30:42,978
Little things that I've been thinking,
about Mr. Todd.

1077
01:30:43,145 --> 01:30:47,440
Not to worry, not to worry
I may not be smart, but I ain't dumb

1078
01:30:49,359 --> 01:30:54,197
I can do it, put me to it
Show me something I can overcome

1079
01:30:55,867 --> 01:31:00,494
Not to worry, ma'am

1080
01:31:02,539 --> 01:31:07,293
Being close and being clever
Ain't like being true

1081
01:31:08,378 --> 01:31:13,425
I don't need to, I won't never
Hide a thing from you

1082
01:31:13,926 --> 01:31:17,804
Like some

1083
01:31:18,890 --> 01:31:22,016
Now, Toby, dear, haven't we had
enough of this foolish chatter?

1084
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:24,310
Yeah.

1085
01:31:24,479 --> 01:31:29,149
How about I give you
a nice, shiny new penny...

1086
01:31:29,317 --> 01:31:31,318
...and you go and get us
some toffees?

1087
01:31:34,988 --> 01:31:36,698
That's Signor Pirelli's purse!

1088
01:31:36,865 --> 01:31:39,743
No, it's not. Just something Mr. T
give me for my birthday.

1089
01:31:39,952 --> 01:31:41,536
That proves it! We gotta go, ma'am.

1090
01:31:41,703 --> 01:31:43,537
We gotta find the beadle
and get the law here!

1091
01:31:43,706 --> 01:31:47,167
Shh! Hush, now,
you're not going anywhere.

1092
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:52,671
You just sit here, nice and quiet,
next to me. That's right. Right.

1093
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:57,260
How could you think
such a thing of Mr. Todd?

1094
01:31:57,470 --> 01:32:00,680
He's been so good to us.

1095
01:32:04,476 --> 01:32:11,065
Nothing's gonna harm you
Not while I'm around

1096
01:32:12,984 --> 01:32:18,405
Nothing's gonna harm you, darling
Not while I'm around

1097
01:32:19,574 --> 01:32:24,954
Demons'll charm you with a smile
For a while

1098
01:32:25,122 --> 01:32:28,582
But in time

1099
01:32:28,751 --> 01:32:32,087
Nothing's gonna harm you

1100
01:32:32,630 --> 01:32:39,261
Not while I'm around

1101
01:32:41,889 --> 01:32:44,807
Funny we should be having
this little chat right now.

1102
01:32:45,016 --> 01:32:47,143
Because I was just thinking...

1103
01:32:47,895 --> 01:32:50,729
You know how you fancy
coming into the bakehouse with me...

1104
01:32:50,898 --> 01:32:52,649
...to help make the pies?

1105
01:32:52,817 --> 01:32:54,149
Yes, ma'am.

1106
01:32:54,318 --> 01:32:59,154
Well, no time like the present, eh?

1107
01:33:18,466 --> 01:33:21,845
I feel bad for you,
going up and down all these stairs.

1108
01:33:22,012 --> 01:33:24,014
Well, that'll be your job now.

1109
01:33:24,180 --> 01:33:25,431
Yes, ma'am.

1110
01:33:30,186 --> 01:33:32,689
Quite a stink, ain't there?

1111
01:33:36,277 --> 01:33:40,195
You see those grates? They go down
to the sewers, and the smells come up.

1112
01:33:40,363 --> 01:33:43,033
Always a few rats
gone home to Jesus down there.

1113
01:33:43,199 --> 01:33:46,869
Now, this'll be the bake oven.
Three dozen at a time.

1114
01:33:47,078 --> 01:33:49,788
Always be sure the door
is closed properly, like this.

1115
01:33:49,957 --> 01:33:51,373
Door's closed properly.

1116
01:33:52,167 --> 01:33:53,376
This is a grinder.

1117
01:33:54,170 --> 01:33:55,712
Pop in the meat.

1118
01:33:56,212 --> 01:33:57,546
Give it a good grind.

1119
01:34:00,967 --> 01:34:02,801
Pops out there.

1120
01:34:04,055 --> 01:34:05,095
You try.

1121
01:34:07,350 --> 01:34:08,725
Good grind.

1122
01:34:10,226 --> 01:34:11,645
Comes out there.

1123
01:34:13,730 --> 01:34:14,814
That's my boy.

1124
01:34:15,358 --> 01:34:18,359
I'm just gonna pop upstairs,
back in two shakes, all right?

1125
01:34:18,527 --> 01:34:21,154
Do you mind if I have a pie
while I wait?

1126
01:34:21,822 --> 01:34:24,198
As many as you like, son.

1127
01:34:36,212 --> 01:34:39,546
FOGG: Oh, yes, sir, I agree.
It would be to our mutual interest...

1128
01:34:39,715 --> 01:34:43,342
...to come to some arrangement
in regard to my poor children's hair.

1129
01:34:43,511 --> 01:34:45,011
Brunettes.

1130
01:34:46,596 --> 01:34:48,555
Redheads.

1131
01:34:50,850 --> 01:34:52,894
I keep the blonds in here.

1132
01:34:53,395 --> 01:34:55,521
It was yellow hair
you was looking for, sir?

1133
01:34:56,023 --> 01:34:57,649
Yes.

1134
01:35:28,596 --> 01:35:30,681
That one there has the shade I need.

1135
01:35:31,307 --> 01:35:32,766
Come, child.

1136
01:35:39,149 --> 01:35:42,985
Smile for the gentleman
and you shall have a sweetie.

1137
01:35:44,738 --> 01:35:47,782
Now, where shall I cut?

1138
01:35:48,324 --> 01:35:51,286
Not another word, Mr. Fogg,
or it will be your last.

1139
01:35:53,788 --> 01:35:58,835
Now I leave you to the mercy
of your children.

1140
01:36:08,929 --> 01:36:12,265
I got him locked in, but if he escapes,
he'll go to the law.

1141
01:36:12,432 --> 01:36:14,809
- Then he won't escape.
- I don't know, Mr. Todd.

1142
01:36:14,976 --> 01:36:16,853
The judge'll be here soon...

1143
01:36:18,605 --> 01:36:21,231
Excuse me, sir. Gave me a fright.

1144
01:36:21,524 --> 01:36:25,194
Not my intention, good madam,
I assure you.

1145
01:36:25,362 --> 01:36:28,530
Though I am here on official business.

1146
01:36:28,948 --> 01:36:34,369
You see, there's been some complaints
about the stink from your chimney.

1147
01:36:34,537 --> 01:36:37,372
They say at night,
it is something most foul.

1148
01:36:38,292 --> 01:36:41,211
Health regulations
and the general public welfare...

1149
01:36:41,377 --> 01:36:43,712
...naturally being my duty...

1150
01:36:43,881 --> 01:36:47,675
...I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to take a look...

1151
01:36:49,552 --> 01:36:51,054
...at your bakehouse.

1152
01:36:52,555 --> 01:36:54,015
Of course, sir.

1153
01:36:54,182 --> 01:36:57,851
But first, why don't you come upstairs?
Let me pamper you.

1154
01:36:59,521 --> 01:37:02,481
Much as I do appreciate
tonsorial doormen...

1155
01:37:02,649 --> 01:37:05,652
...I really ought to see
to my official obligations first.

1156
01:37:05,819 --> 01:37:07,820
I completely understand.

1157
01:37:10,573 --> 01:37:14,828
If you'll indulge me, sir,
what is that exotic aroma?

1158
01:37:16,329 --> 01:37:17,913
Ah. Heh.

1159
01:37:18,082 --> 01:37:21,708
Me secret is a touch of ambergris.

1160
01:37:22,545 --> 01:37:25,087
Dare I offer you something
a tad more appropriate...

1161
01:37:25,296 --> 01:37:27,090
...for a gentleman of your standing?

1162
01:37:27,925 --> 01:37:30,592
The ladies will
greatly appreciate it, sir.

1163
01:37:33,596 --> 01:37:36,765
Well, you are the expert
in these matters.

1164
01:37:36,934 --> 01:37:39,018
Only take a moment.

1165
01:37:42,939 --> 01:37:45,399
Would you like a bit of bay rum, sir?

1166
01:37:45,568 --> 01:37:48,278
Ooh. Bay rum is very bracing.

1167
01:38:53,927 --> 01:38:55,177
Let me out!

1168
01:38:55,679 --> 01:38:57,305
Please, let me out!

1169
01:39:00,141 --> 01:39:01,893
Let me out!

1170
01:39:19,328 --> 01:39:21,037
LOVETT: Toby?

1171
01:39:22,456 --> 01:39:24,207
Where is he?

1172
01:39:28,002 --> 01:39:33,048
Toby, where are you, love?

1173
01:39:35,135 --> 01:39:36,719
Toby?

1174
01:39:40,349 --> 01:39:43,893
LOVETT:
Nothing's gonna harm you

1175
01:39:44,060 --> 01:39:46,561
Not while I'm around

1176
01:39:47,439 --> 01:39:48,523
Toby?

1177
01:39:50,442 --> 01:39:52,234
LOVETT: Where are you hiding?

1178
01:39:54,195 --> 01:39:55,654
SWEENEY: Toby?

1179
01:39:56,657 --> 01:40:00,534
Nothing's gonna harm you, darling

1180
01:40:02,371 --> 01:40:05,247
Not while I'm around

1181
01:40:09,002 --> 01:40:10,962
Toby!

1182
01:40:12,381 --> 01:40:14,090
Mr. Todd!

1183
01:40:15,759 --> 01:40:20,470
You wait for him here. I'll return
with a coach in less than half an hour.

1184
01:40:21,347 --> 01:40:24,516
Don't worry. No one'll recognize you.

1185
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:25,935
You're safe now.

1186
01:40:26,561 --> 01:40:28,270
Safe?

1187
01:40:28,439 --> 01:40:31,356
So we run away
and then all our dreams come true?

1188
01:40:32,525 --> 01:40:33,943
I hope so.

1189
01:40:34,987 --> 01:40:39,114
I've never had dreams.
Only nightmares.

1190
01:40:39,283 --> 01:40:40,533
Johanna...

1191
01:40:41,118 --> 01:40:44,078
...when we're free of this place,
all the ghosts will go away.

1192
01:40:44,997 --> 01:40:48,875
No, Anthony. They never go away.

1193
01:40:49,417 --> 01:40:53,628
I'll be right back to you.
Half an hour and we'll be free.

1194
01:41:28,748 --> 01:41:32,292
BEGGAR WOMAN: Beadle, beadle

1195
01:41:32,461 --> 01:41:36,338
No good hiding, I saw you

1196
01:41:37,548 --> 01:41:41,761
Are you in there still, beadle?
Beadle?

1197
01:41:42,429 --> 01:41:45,139
Beadle, dear beadle?

1198
01:41:47,518 --> 01:41:51,686
Beadle deedle deedle deedle deedle
Dumpling, beadle dumpling

1199
01:41:51,854 --> 01:41:54,981
Be-deedle deedle deedle deedle deedle
Deedle deedle deedle deedle deedle

1200
01:41:55,149 --> 01:41:56,775
Deedle deedle deedle de...

1201
01:41:59,863 --> 01:42:02,573
Who are you?
What are you doing in here?

1202
01:42:05,077 --> 01:42:06,452
Evil is here, sir.

1203
01:42:06,619 --> 01:42:11,332
The stink of evil, from below, from her!
She's the devil's wife.

1204
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:16,212
Beware her, sir.
She with no pity in her heart.

1205
01:42:16,380 --> 01:42:20,132
Hey, don't I know you, mister?

1206
01:42:20,466 --> 01:42:22,217
TURPIN: Mr. Todd?

1207
01:42:33,313 --> 01:42:35,230
Where is she?

1208
01:42:36,149 --> 01:42:38,734
Below, Your Honor. With my neighbor.

1209
01:42:39,819 --> 01:42:43,405
Thank heavens the sailor
did not molest her.

1210
01:42:43,573 --> 01:42:47,659
Thank heavens, too, she has seen
the error of her ways.

1211
01:42:48,871 --> 01:42:50,371
She has?

1212
01:42:50,538 --> 01:42:51,913
Oh, yes.

1213
01:42:52,082 --> 01:42:54,417
Your lesson was well-learned.

1214
01:42:54,585 --> 01:42:58,712
She speaks only of you.
Longing for forgiveness.

1215
01:43:00,381 --> 01:43:03,091
Then she shall have it.

1216
01:43:03,635 --> 01:43:05,927
She'll be here soon, you say?

1217
01:43:06,095 --> 01:43:07,137
Yes.

1218
01:43:07,555 --> 01:43:10,056
Excellent, my friend.

1219
01:43:11,435 --> 01:43:13,144
How about a shave?

1220
01:43:14,563 --> 01:43:17,606
Sit, sir. Sit.

1221
01:43:19,859 --> 01:43:22,235
Oh

1222
01:43:23,029 --> 01:43:25,614
- Pretty women
- Pretty women, yes

1223
01:43:25,782 --> 01:43:28,868
Johanna, Johanna

1224
01:43:29,036 --> 01:43:32,537
Pretty women
Pretty women are a wonder

1225
01:43:32,706 --> 01:43:34,247
Pretty women

1226
01:43:34,416 --> 01:43:37,710
- What we do for pretty women
- Pretty women

1227
01:43:37,877 --> 01:43:41,756
- Blowing out their candles
- Blowing out their candles

1228
01:43:41,923 --> 01:43:44,800
- Or combing out their hair
- Combing out their hair

1229
01:43:44,967 --> 01:43:46,219
Then they leave

1230
01:43:46,386 --> 01:43:50,139
- Even when they leave
- Even when they leave you and vanish

1231
01:43:50,306 --> 01:43:53,935
- They still are there
- They somehow can still remain

1232
01:43:54,101 --> 01:43:58,104
- There with you, there
- They're there

1233
01:43:59,149 --> 01:44:02,484
How seldom it is
one meets a fellow spirit.

1234
01:44:02,653 --> 01:44:05,488
With fellow tastes...

1235
01:44:05,697 --> 01:44:06,948
...in women, at least.

1236
01:44:07,615 --> 01:44:09,158
What's that?

1237
01:44:10,118 --> 01:44:12,994
The years, no doubt,
have changed me, sir.

1238
01:44:13,204 --> 01:44:15,706
But then, I suppose
the face of a barber...

1239
01:44:16,291 --> 01:44:19,835
...the face of a prisoner in the dock,
is not particularly memorable.

1240
01:44:27,135 --> 01:44:29,220
Benjamin Barker.

1241
01:44:29,805 --> 01:44:31,514
Benjamin Barker!

1242
01:45:10,386 --> 01:45:14,472
Rest now, my friend

1243
01:45:15,891 --> 01:45:20,061
Rest now forever

1244
01:45:21,898 --> 01:45:27,903
Sleep now the untroubled sleep

1245
01:45:28,070 --> 01:45:32,908
Of the angels

1246
01:45:43,878 --> 01:45:47,088
- Come for a shave, have you, lad?
- No, I...

1247
01:45:51,511 --> 01:45:53,386
Everyone needs a good shave.

1248
01:46:01,604 --> 01:46:02,771
Forget my face.

1249
01:46:07,610 --> 01:46:10,237
Die! God in heaven, die!

1250
01:46:24,252 --> 01:46:25,293
You.

1251
01:46:34,930 --> 01:46:36,262
Why did you scream?

1252
01:46:36,430 --> 01:46:38,974
He was catching onto me dress,
but he's finished now.

1253
01:46:39,893 --> 01:46:42,144
SWEENEY:
I'll take care of it. Open the door.

1254
01:46:42,354 --> 01:46:43,729
Open the door, I said.

1255
01:47:39,034 --> 01:47:41,828
"Don't I know you," she said.

1256
01:47:51,338 --> 01:47:53,173
You knew she lived.

1257
01:47:55,051 --> 01:47:57,219
I was only thinking of you.

1258
01:48:00,931 --> 01:48:02,224
You lied to me.

1259
01:48:03,185 --> 01:48:05,351
No, no, not lied at all

1260
01:48:05,520 --> 01:48:06,686
No, I never lied

1261
01:48:06,854 --> 01:48:07,896
Lucy

1262
01:48:08,064 --> 01:48:10,800
Said she took the poison, she did
Never said that she died

1263
01:48:10,867 --> 01:48:12,792
- I've come home again
- Poor thing, she lived

1264
01:48:12,860 --> 01:48:14,319
But it left her weak in the head

1265
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:16,738
All she did for months
Was just lie there in bed

1266
01:48:16,948 --> 01:48:19,992
Should've been in hospital
Wound up in Bedlam instead

1267
01:48:20,159 --> 01:48:21,659
LOVETT: Poor thing
- Oh, my God

1268
01:48:21,828 --> 01:48:26,164
Better you should think she was dead
Yes, I lied 'cause I love you

1269
01:48:26,332 --> 01:48:29,083
- I'd be twice the wife she was
- Lucy

1270
01:48:29,252 --> 01:48:31,086
- I love you
- What have I done?

1271
01:48:31,253 --> 01:48:34,590
Could that thing have cared for you
Like me?

1272
01:48:34,757 --> 01:48:37,717
Mrs. Lovett, you're a bloody wonder
Eminently practical

1273
01:48:37,886 --> 01:48:39,662
And yet appropriate as always

1274
01:48:39,729 --> 01:48:42,530
As you've said repeatedly
There's little point in dwelling on the past

1275
01:48:42,599 --> 01:48:44,332
- Now, come here, my love
- Do you mean it?

1276
01:48:44,335 --> 01:48:46,452
Everything I did, I swear
I thought was only for the best

1277
01:48:46,453 --> 01:48:48,354
Not a thing to fear, my love
What's dead is dead

1278
01:48:48,354 --> 01:48:49,604
Can we still be married?

1279
01:48:49,773 --> 01:48:52,899
SWEENEY:
The history of the world, my pet

1280
01:48:53,359 --> 01:48:56,779
Oh, Mr. Todd, oh, Mr. Todd
Leave it to me

1281
01:48:56,947 --> 01:48:59,614
Is learn forgiveness and try to forget

1282
01:48:59,783 --> 01:49:01,617
By the sea, Mr. Todd
We'll be comfy-cozy

1283
01:49:01,685 --> 01:49:03,676
By the sea, Mr. Todd
Where there's no one nosy

1284
01:49:03,744 --> 01:49:08,582
And life is for the alive, my dear
So let's keep living it

1285
01:49:08,750 --> 01:49:12,127
- Just keep living it, really living it
- Just keep living it, really living it

1286
01:50:00,176 --> 01:50:03,804
There was a barber and his wife

1287
01:50:05,599 --> 01:50:10,060
And she was beautiful

1288
01:50:12,314 --> 01:50:16,358
A foolish barber and his wife

1289
01:50:17,569 --> 01:50:21,863
She was his reason and his life

1290
01:50:22,990 --> 01:50:27,368
And she was beautiful

1291
01:50:28,454 --> 01:50:33,125
And she was virtuous

1292
01:50:34,711 --> 01:50:38,463
And he was...
