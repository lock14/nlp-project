1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


2
00:04:26,026 --> 00:04:27,111
Thank you.

3
00:04:29,947 --> 00:04:32,450
Do I really have to drink
the whole glass?

4
00:04:32,533 --> 00:04:34,034
Yes.

5
00:04:34,118 --> 00:04:38,873
Today, in April 1905,
we find it's the best way to cure anemia.

6
00:04:39,415 --> 00:04:42,835
Drink, my dear,
it will bring back your color.

7
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:12,990
It's only ox blood after all.

8
00:05:14,241 --> 00:05:19,747
Yes, but look at this man
who slaughters for a living

9
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:22,374
and breathes in
the smell of blood.

10
00:06:08,671 --> 00:06:12,591
It's not a game, young lady.
It's a therapy.

11
00:06:48,836 --> 00:06:50,838
I hope you're satisfied.

12
00:06:52,256 --> 00:06:54,174
The information was correct.

13
00:06:55,301 --> 00:06:58,679
This man was carrying... gold!

14
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:04,310
We'd like to see this gold,

15
00:07:04,393 --> 00:07:05,936
right now.

16
00:07:19,742 --> 00:07:23,829
Right, let's split up now
and meet again in a month's time.

17
00:07:23,912 --> 00:07:27,333
One month will give me time
to negotiate in London.

18
00:07:27,416 --> 00:07:29,460
That's not quite how I see it.

19
00:07:29,543 --> 00:07:31,128
Me and my mates

20
00:07:31,211 --> 00:07:33,797
would like the cash straightaway

21
00:07:33,881 --> 00:07:35,633
You don't trust me?

22
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:37,426
No, not really.

23
00:07:39,553 --> 00:07:40,721
Open the bag.

24
00:07:53,567 --> 00:07:56,195
I'm taking the girl with me
as a hostage.

25
00:07:56,278 --> 00:07:58,405
Don't try to find me.

26
00:07:58,489 --> 00:08:00,616
And afterwards, will you kill her?

27
00:08:02,785 --> 00:08:04,745
If you lay a finger on her,
you're dead.

28
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:07,289
Relax.

29
00:08:07,915 --> 00:08:09,917
I'll let her go afterwards.

30
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:15,422
No, don't leave me. He'll kill me
as soon as your backs are turned.

31
00:08:16,924 --> 00:08:18,676
Shall we all jump on him together?

32
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,927
Too risky.

33
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,180
If you try to disappear,
<i>we'll</i> find you.

34
00:08:40,197 --> 00:08:41,198
Don't move.

35
00:08:41,281 --> 00:08:44,118
She's crafty, she'll get away.

36
00:09:02,177 --> 00:09:03,971
You want to finish me off, don't you?

37
00:09:06,598 --> 00:09:09,309
Of course not. Be sensible.

38
00:09:09,393 --> 00:09:10,894
I'm not a killer.

39
00:09:10,978 --> 00:09:14,565
I'm not like your cohorts

40
00:09:16,108 --> 00:09:18,068
We're going to head
towards the coast,

41
00:09:18,152 --> 00:09:21,488
and then you can take off.

42
00:09:25,576 --> 00:09:26,827
Is it far?

43
00:09:29,163 --> 00:09:33,083
Two days' walk,
unless you see a car.

44
00:09:37,921 --> 00:09:39,214
Look.

45
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:42,885
Take me and let me go.

46
00:10:09,077 --> 00:10:10,287
You swine!

47
00:10:49,409 --> 00:10:50,953
There he is!

48
00:10:55,457 --> 00:10:57,042
Catch him!

49
00:13:22,854 --> 00:13:24,481
- He's in there.
- Follow him.

50
00:13:24,564 --> 00:13:25,607
Wait.

51
00:13:27,067 --> 00:13:30,112
Better to wait
until he thinks he's safe.

52
00:15:28,021 --> 00:15:30,440
I won't do you any harm
if you show yourself.

53
00:15:33,026 --> 00:15:34,986
I know you're in this room.

54
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,712
Who are you?

55
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,048
A chambermaid?

56
00:15:55,132 --> 00:15:58,260
I'm lady-in-waiting to the Marchioness.

57
00:16:00,512 --> 00:16:02,264
What's your name?

58
00:16:02,347 --> 00:16:04,516
How many servants are there here?

59
00:16:04,599 --> 00:16:06,393
I'm the only one.

60
00:16:06,476 --> 00:16:08,895
No, I've just seen someone else.

61
00:16:09,604 --> 00:16:13,150
That was Elisabeth,
the Marchioness's companion.

62
00:16:13,525 --> 00:16:16,069
I swear that we're alone
at the moment.

63
00:16:16,736 --> 00:16:18,405
The cook and the servants

64
00:16:18,488 --> 00:16:20,866
arrive tomorrow
with the Marquis and Madame.

65
00:16:22,242 --> 00:16:23,952
They're all away in Paris.

66
00:16:24,035 --> 00:16:27,414
We've come to clean up
and get Madame's room ready, but -

67
00:16:44,139 --> 00:16:46,391
it's no good. They're too far away.

68
00:16:47,017 --> 00:16:49,269
Be patient. We've got him.

69
00:17:08,413 --> 00:17:11,499
Right, now I want the truth!

70
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,461
How many of you are there
in the château?

71
00:17:15,921 --> 00:17:17,380
Just us.

72
00:17:17,464 --> 00:17:19,549
The other servants don't arrive
until tomorrow.

73
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:23,970
The château should be closed,
but we pretend it's ours.

74
00:17:24,054 --> 00:17:26,097
That's why we came first.

75
00:17:27,557 --> 00:17:29,226
Take whatever you want.

76
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:30,977
But don't hurt us.

77
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:33,063
We won't say a thing.

78
00:17:38,735 --> 00:17:40,278
Don't be afraid.

79
00:17:40,946 --> 00:17:46,076
I just want to hide until dark,
then I'll go.

80
00:17:47,702 --> 00:17:51,748
You're going to take me
to your room now, please.

81
00:17:52,832 --> 00:17:55,502
Come on, you go first.

82
00:19:44,903 --> 00:19:47,197
I see I don't frighten you any more.

83
00:19:51,284 --> 00:19:53,411
We even find it rather amusing.

84
00:19:53,495 --> 00:19:55,538
In spite of your big gun.

85
00:19:55,622 --> 00:19:57,540
You haven't come to rob us,
have you?

86
00:19:57,624 --> 00:20:00,543
What do you want
from two poor girls like us?

87
00:20:00,627 --> 00:20:03,129
Defenseless and at your mercy.

88
00:20:03,421 --> 00:20:06,716
- I beg you not to kill us.
- You can rape us.

89
00:20:08,259 --> 00:20:11,096
I offer you my virginity
in return for my life.

90
00:20:11,179 --> 00:20:14,808
Do with me whatever you wish,
but spare this child.

91
00:20:14,891 --> 00:20:16,976
I beg you, Mr. Bandit, don't kill us.

92
00:20:29,322 --> 00:20:30,865
Is the show over?

93
00:24:28,436 --> 00:24:30,229
What are you doing?

94
00:24:31,272 --> 00:24:33,441
I just wanted to kiss you.

95
00:24:35,652 --> 00:24:37,570
All the doors have two keys.

96
00:24:38,404 --> 00:24:41,616
The spare for my bedroom
was in the bedside table.

97
00:25:19,112 --> 00:25:21,322
Now I need an explanation.

98
00:25:23,116 --> 00:25:25,576
Lady-in-waiting, or companion.

99
00:25:26,536 --> 00:25:32,458
I want to know right now who you are
and why this château is deserted.

100
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,336
We can ask questions too.

101
00:25:36,087 --> 00:25:38,005
Who is chasing you, and why?

102
00:25:41,092 --> 00:25:43,886
Except that it's me who has a gun,

103
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:45,930
and it's me who gives the orders.

104
00:25:46,639 --> 00:25:49,976
You no longer have your gun.

105
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:53,187
We've taken precautions.

106
00:25:53,271 --> 00:25:57,108
Look. We have a little surprise for you.

107
00:26:05,408 --> 00:26:07,660
Our weapons are silent.

108
00:26:07,744 --> 00:26:10,580
There are two of us, you're all alone.

109
00:26:10,663 --> 00:26:14,041
- You're in our power.
- Your life is in our hands.

110
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,837
The gold coins in your bag.

111
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,892
What shall we do with him?

112
00:26:31,476 --> 00:26:34,437
You mentioned wanting to rape him.

113
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,106
Why not? He's a good-looking boy.

114
00:26:37,648 --> 00:26:39,609
Don't provoke me.

115
00:26:49,368 --> 00:26:51,412
What do you take me for?

116
00:26:55,208 --> 00:26:58,795
Did you really think I'd let you
get away with that and not do anything?

117
00:27:02,423 --> 00:27:06,344
It's not for two little girls like you
to lay down the law.

118
00:27:15,061 --> 00:27:16,687
The show's over.

119
00:27:21,359 --> 00:27:23,319
You're charming.

120
00:27:24,028 --> 00:27:25,613
Adorable.

121
00:27:27,365 --> 00:27:29,367
But I've got work to do.

122
00:27:30,493 --> 00:27:32,036
Excuse me,

123
00:27:32,954 --> 00:27:34,372
I'll leave you now.

124
00:27:34,455 --> 00:27:36,749
Your enemies can't be far away.

125
00:27:37,124 --> 00:27:38,751
That's true.

126
00:27:38,835 --> 00:27:40,670
You had better wait until dark.

127
00:27:40,753 --> 00:27:42,672
It would be safer.

128
00:27:53,599 --> 00:27:55,351
Why not here?

129
00:28:05,403 --> 00:28:07,613
Don't do that.

130
00:28:07,697 --> 00:28:09,782
What's your friend Elisabeth going to say?

131
00:28:23,212 --> 00:28:26,883
But Elisabeth doesn't care,
do you, Elisabeth?

132
00:28:26,966 --> 00:28:29,719
Of course not.
It's all the same to me.

133
00:28:30,219 --> 00:28:31,721
Trust us.

134
00:28:31,804 --> 00:28:34,974
We could have got away
and raised the alarm just now.

135
00:28:38,769 --> 00:28:41,022
Come into the next room.

136
00:28:41,105 --> 00:28:44,025
We can make up some punch,

137
00:28:44,108 --> 00:28:46,235
and there's a fire in there.

138
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:51,324
Later, when it gets dark,
you can leave if you like.

139
00:28:52,325 --> 00:28:58,331
Come and I'll tell you why we sent
all the staff away from the château.

140
00:28:58,831 --> 00:29:05,171
When it gets dark, you'll know
why the two of us are here alone.

141
00:29:36,619 --> 00:29:38,663
It's too late now.

142
00:29:38,746 --> 00:29:41,999
You've stumbled into
Elisabeth and Eva's life.

143
00:29:43,042 --> 00:29:46,128
The universe of madness and death.

144
00:29:49,423 --> 00:29:50,925
It's a pity.

145
00:29:52,385 --> 00:29:55,805
I think I could have loved you

146
00:33:40,112 --> 00:33:42,907
You know I only did it
to stop him leaving,

147
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,825
to keep him here till dawn.

148
00:33:46,952 --> 00:33:50,789
I was playing with the gun
and it went off.

149
00:34:00,716 --> 00:34:02,635
This time I'm going.

150
00:34:02,718 --> 00:34:05,304
The shot will certainly
have been heard outside.

151
00:34:28,118 --> 00:34:29,954
Is there a back way out?

152
00:34:30,037 --> 00:34:32,790
We're surrounded by water.
The bridge is the only way out.

153
00:34:35,251 --> 00:34:36,835
We're trapped.

154
00:34:37,461 --> 00:34:41,048
- When do the staff come back?
- Not for two days.

155
00:34:41,632 --> 00:34:44,343
But at nightfall-

156
00:34:44,426 --> 00:34:46,720
A few friends will be coming.

157
00:34:46,804 --> 00:34:50,224
We don't want the staff around
while they're here.

158
00:34:50,808 --> 00:34:53,852
Nobody must know
who's coming tonight.

159
00:34:57,564 --> 00:34:59,984
It's all very melodramatic.

160
00:35:00,609 --> 00:35:03,279
I don't care which
mysterious lover you're expecting

161
00:35:03,362 --> 00:35:05,114
I have to get out of here.

162
00:35:05,197 --> 00:35:08,033
I think there's an old boat.

163
00:35:08,117 --> 00:35:10,202
We could use it
to escape to the other side.

164
00:35:10,286 --> 00:35:12,830
Well, go and find it <i>-</i> quickly!

165
00:35:15,207 --> 00:35:18,711
Mark, our guests mustn't see you.

166
00:35:18,794 --> 00:35:20,129
Why does it matter?

167
00:35:20,212 --> 00:35:23,173
Escape before they get here,
before it gets dark.

168
00:35:27,386 --> 00:35:29,805
Listen,
I know nothing about your secrets,

169
00:35:29,888 --> 00:35:32,349
but I don't intend to be captured.

170
00:35:33,183 --> 00:35:35,227
I'm expected in London.

171
00:35:36,895 --> 00:35:38,605
<i>But...

172
00:35:39,189 --> 00:35:40,858
are you crying?

173
00:35:41,859 --> 00:35:43,068
Why?

174
00:35:43,861 --> 00:35:46,572
Can't you see
that I'm trying to save you?

175
00:35:47,156 --> 00:35:50,909
Don't you realize that Eva
only did it to keep you here?

176
00:35:51,702 --> 00:35:54,121
Didn't you realize that I loved you?

177
00:35:54,204 --> 00:35:57,207
That I've loved you
since you first arrived at the château.

178
00:35:59,293 --> 00:36:00,711
We've got him.

179
00:36:00,794 --> 00:36:02,338
He's armed.

180
00:36:02,421 --> 00:36:04,298
Tonight, I'll get to the door.

181
00:36:06,008 --> 00:36:07,801
Leave one of the girls.

182
00:36:07,885 --> 00:36:09,803
I'll take care of her myself.

183
00:36:13,682 --> 00:36:14,933
Look!

184
00:36:22,232 --> 00:36:24,360
My God, the bag with the money!

185
00:36:24,443 --> 00:36:25,778
The bitch!

186
00:37:00,145 --> 00:37:01,772
Here's the money.

187
00:37:01,855 --> 00:37:03,482
Take it and go.

188
00:37:04,066 --> 00:37:06,110
Not so fast. <i>We'll</i> count it first.

189
00:37:06,193 --> 00:37:08,529
- Let's kill her and then count it.
- Shut up.

190
00:37:09,738 --> 00:37:11,573
The stables are over there.

191
00:37:11,657 --> 00:37:14,743
You can count it there in peace.

192
00:37:29,508 --> 00:37:32,845
They're taking her away.
You set that up, didn't you?

193
00:37:33,929 --> 00:37:36,390
You're mad. They'll kill her.

194
00:37:36,682 --> 00:37:38,976
Don't worry, she'll be back.

195
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:42,062
It was the only way
to keep you alive until this evening.

196
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,982
Now, tell me the truth,

197
00:37:46,191 --> 00:37:48,277
who's coming here tonight?

198
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:51,655
Death.

199
00:38:35,866 --> 00:38:37,367
Listen...

200
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:40,829
I'm giving the orders now.

201
00:38:40,913 --> 00:38:43,290
We're going to swap places.

202
00:38:43,373 --> 00:38:46,710
You give your dress to my wife
and she goes for a walk in the park.

203
00:38:47,794 --> 00:38:51,256
I'm going to treat you
like I treat her.

204
00:41:06,933 --> 00:41:08,060
Go on, get in!

205
00:41:17,903 --> 00:41:19,446
You'll see.

206
00:41:19,529 --> 00:41:23,283
People like you think I'm crazy,
degenerate.

207
00:41:23,367 --> 00:41:26,286
But no,
I'm just a little bit special.

208
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:29,373
You'll see -
just a little bit special.

209
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:40,235
Don't leave him.
You know he's half-crazy.

210
00:42:40,318 --> 00:42:42,654
Exactly. He wanted her, you see.

211
00:47:19,639 --> 00:47:24,102
You could still leave the château
before it gets dark.

212
00:47:24,185 --> 00:47:26,479
- Swim across the moat and escape.
- No way.

213
00:47:26,563 --> 00:47:28,857
Eva isn't coming back.
They'll kill her.

214
00:47:28,940 --> 00:47:31,484
- I'll go.
- It's not worth it. Look.

215
00:47:35,321 --> 00:47:39,868
Well, what's this farce?
Are you making fun of me or what?

216
00:47:40,535 --> 00:47:42,454
Anyway, I'm staying.

217
00:48:45,892 --> 00:48:50,355
Ah, so you're the mysterious danger
that the girls have been expecting.

218
00:48:54,275 --> 00:48:55,902
Do you find me dangerous?

219
00:49:00,532 --> 00:49:04,410
Like danger, you're attractive,

220
00:49:05,203 --> 00:49:08,039
but there the likeness ends.

221
00:49:08,498 --> 00:49:12,710
Beware, death sometimes
takes the form of seduction.

222
00:49:17,715 --> 00:49:23,513
Just now, Elisabeth was saying
that death would appear at the château.

223
00:49:27,851 --> 00:49:29,352
Here it is.

224
00:49:31,813 --> 00:49:33,356
Let me guess.

225
00:49:33,439 --> 00:49:35,316
You rock tables,

226
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:37,360
you invoke spirits -

227
00:49:38,570 --> 00:49:40,071
Or perhaps -

228
00:49:41,906 --> 00:49:45,618
Or perhaps you just wait for men.

229
00:49:52,834 --> 00:49:54,586
It's nothing like that.

230
00:49:55,086 --> 00:49:56,629
It's a club,

231
00:49:57,130 --> 00:49:59,090
a sort of gathering for women.

232
00:49:59,799 --> 00:50:01,384
If you stay-

233
00:50:01,885 --> 00:50:04,345
and I know that you're going to -

234
00:50:04,429 --> 00:50:07,140
you'll be the only man.

235
00:50:07,223 --> 00:50:10,059
Except for Satan himself, of course.

236
00:50:12,187 --> 00:50:14,647
But what's this club all about?

237
00:50:17,609 --> 00:50:19,110
You'll see.

238
00:50:19,611 --> 00:50:21,279
You'll see...

239
00:50:21,779 --> 00:50:24,741
let's say, at midnight.

240
00:50:27,243 --> 00:50:30,121
Ah, at midnight.

241
00:50:32,624 --> 00:50:34,125
Satan.

242
00:50:35,585 --> 00:50:37,086
Death!

243
00:50:37,795 --> 00:50:40,131
You're still not afraid?

244
00:50:41,674 --> 00:50:43,176
I am!

245
00:50:47,055 --> 00:50:52,977
I'm even beginning to find the situation
very amusing.

246
00:51:01,486 --> 00:51:06,366
I believe you've been talking
to your guest about a danger.

247
00:51:07,784 --> 00:51:10,954
It was to intrigue him,
so he wouldn't leave.

248
00:51:12,705 --> 00:51:17,126
I trust that you wouldn't try
to chase him away, would you?

249
00:51:20,421 --> 00:51:23,007
I see that you've met him.

250
00:51:24,008 --> 00:51:26,010
Go and greet the other guests.

251
00:51:37,188 --> 00:51:39,148
Who is still to come?

252
00:51:39,232 --> 00:51:41,276
A few friends.

253
00:51:41,359 --> 00:51:43,820
Come, let's go and receive them.

254
00:51:44,362 --> 00:51:48,366
But first, let me look at you.

255
00:51:51,869 --> 00:51:53,288
You've been bleeding.

256
00:51:53,371 --> 00:51:54,372
A bit.

257
00:51:54,455 --> 00:51:55,957
That's good.

258
00:51:56,833 --> 00:51:58,835
You're handsome.

259
00:51:58,918 --> 00:52:00,044
And strong.

260
00:52:00,128 --> 00:52:01,587
Really?

261
00:52:03,214 --> 00:52:07,510
You don't mind if I examine you
as if you were my horse?

262
00:52:14,892 --> 00:52:16,769
That's very amusing.

263
00:52:17,353 --> 00:52:21,232
You and your friends are going to
a lot of trouble to entertain me.

264
00:52:21,899 --> 00:52:24,319
Take care that I don't get bored.

265
00:52:26,404 --> 00:52:29,574
You think that
you could get bored with me?

266
00:52:31,909 --> 00:52:35,079
You'd love to take me by force.

267
00:52:46,257 --> 00:52:48,259
I'm only taken if I want to be.

268
00:52:49,677 --> 00:52:51,929
I'm in charge here.

269
00:52:53,556 --> 00:52:55,183
Of everybody.

270
00:52:55,266 --> 00:52:56,768
Even you.

271
00:53:00,229 --> 00:53:03,232
Come on, I forgive you.

272
00:53:05,985 --> 00:53:08,821
Curiosity obliges me to say nothing.

273
00:53:44,023 --> 00:53:46,025
Everything's ready.
You can come in.

274
00:53:46,567 --> 00:53:48,569
Who's at the château at the moment?

275
00:53:48,653 --> 00:53:51,030
Elisabeth, Eva and a guest.

276
00:53:51,114 --> 00:53:53,408
- A guest? A man?
- Yes.

277
00:53:53,491 --> 00:53:56,035
- What's he doing?
- Is he expecting to see us all?

278
00:53:56,619 --> 00:54:00,873
He knows there's a gathering tonight
and he wants to be there.

279
00:54:00,957 --> 00:54:03,876
- Where is he?
- In the drawing room.

280
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,837
Should we get changed straightaway?

281
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:09,298
Keep those clothes on for now.
We'll put on the veils at midnight.

282
00:54:10,258 --> 00:54:13,845
Who is this man who's going to
take part in our reunion?

283
00:54:13,928 --> 00:54:16,973
He's a thief on the run.
Isn't that amusing?

284
00:54:18,850 --> 00:54:20,268
How ironic-

285
00:54:20,351 --> 00:54:24,772
a crook on the run hiding out here
on the night of our annual reunion!

286
00:54:24,856 --> 00:54:26,524
Is he attractive?

287
00:54:27,859 --> 00:54:29,694
- Has he got style?
- Is he strong?

288
00:54:29,777 --> 00:54:32,864
What color are his eyes - blue?

289
00:54:32,947 --> 00:54:35,199
Come, let's go and find him.

290
00:54:56,012 --> 00:54:57,889
Oh, very nice.

291
00:55:00,057 --> 00:55:02,059
How impressive.

292
00:55:03,227 --> 00:55:05,229
Is this for the arrival of Death?

293
00:55:08,608 --> 00:55:11,486
But where are the guests?

294
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:14,071
I don't see them.

295
00:56:08,918 --> 00:56:13,714
So when do you start your
mysterious reunion? I can't wait.

296
00:56:13,798 --> 00:56:15,967
At midnight and not before.

297
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:18,761
Don't be in such a hurry.
You might regret it.

298
00:56:19,720 --> 00:56:22,890
Make the most of life, and of us!

299
00:56:22,974 --> 00:56:26,143
You seem to be telling me
to enjoy my last moments.

300
00:56:26,727 --> 00:56:29,146
No one survives our secret ceremonies.

301
00:56:39,657 --> 00:56:42,368
Then I must do as you say.

302
00:56:42,451 --> 00:56:43,619
Let's see.

303
00:57:45,222 --> 00:57:47,433
Elisabeth is strange this evening.

304
00:57:47,516 --> 00:57:51,854
She set out to make him stay,
but her heart's not in it.

305
00:57:52,355 --> 00:57:54,649
What a pity

306
00:57:54,732 --> 00:57:56,359
for him.

307
00:57:57,068 --> 00:57:58,694
And for her.

308
00:58:09,038 --> 00:58:11,999
Elisabeth, you seem preoccupied.

309
00:58:12,083 --> 00:58:15,920
I was thinking that I wanted you
more than ever.

310
00:58:16,504 --> 00:58:18,422
You're mine.

311
00:58:19,924 --> 00:58:24,845
I don't belong to anyone -
not to you, nor to your mysterious friends.

312
00:58:24,929 --> 00:58:26,972
The only reason I stayed...

313
00:58:27,765 --> 00:58:29,850
was for your secret meeting.

314
00:58:29,934 --> 00:58:34,855
I don't believe in Eva's passion
or your unlikely words of love.

315
00:58:35,773 --> 00:58:38,818
Maybe one of us was sincere,
but what does it matter.

316
00:58:40,069 --> 00:58:45,700
At midnight, you'll see what
seven women can do to a lone man.

317
00:58:51,497 --> 00:58:53,791
I'm tired of all your secrets!

318
00:58:55,334 --> 00:58:57,878
All your efforts to scare me are useless!

319
00:58:59,463 --> 00:59:01,132
I want to enjoy myself!

320
01:01:24,275 --> 01:01:25,776
Find us!

321
01:01:39,123 --> 01:01:40,833
It's...

322
01:01:43,919 --> 01:01:45,170
Eva!

323
01:01:46,964 --> 01:01:48,966
You got it wrong!

324
01:02:17,870 --> 01:02:19,872
It's...

325
01:02:22,833 --> 01:02:24,251
Helen!

326
01:02:25,544 --> 01:02:26,879
You've won.

327
01:02:28,672 --> 01:02:32,259
- Then I have a right to a forfeit.
- Yes, but it will have to be quick.

328
01:02:32,343 --> 01:02:35,888
It's past 11:00,
and the games stop at midnight.

329
01:02:37,014 --> 01:02:43,729
For fifteen minutes,
you'll obey me as if you were my slave.

330
01:02:45,397 --> 01:02:49,109
- So be it.
- Come to the smoking room.

331
01:02:56,825 --> 01:02:58,786
- Stop them.
- Why?

332
01:02:59,328 --> 01:03:01,038
Don't you feel anything for him?

333
01:03:01,121 --> 01:03:04,500
Elisabeth, you're not going
to betray us, are you?

334
01:03:05,042 --> 01:03:10,965
- You're not in love with him?
- No, of course not. Only-

335
01:03:11,048 --> 01:03:12,633
Only?

336
01:03:12,716 --> 01:03:14,093
Why her?

337
01:03:14,176 --> 01:03:16,470
Those are the risks of blindman's bluff.

338
01:03:16,553 --> 01:03:18,389
Do you think she cheated?

339
01:03:18,931 --> 01:03:21,642
I was watching closely.
He guessed correctly on his own.

340
01:03:21,725 --> 01:03:25,312
He didn't recognize me.
What do you think he'll do to her?

341
01:03:25,396 --> 01:03:27,398
I'd love to be in her place.

342
01:03:28,273 --> 01:03:31,860
He'll take revenge, humiliate her.

343
01:03:32,987 --> 01:03:35,364
We forced him to stay here.

344
01:03:35,447 --> 01:03:37,783
He was manipulated and he knows it.

345
01:03:38,492 --> 01:03:42,788
He'll take revenge on her
because she's the one in charge.

346
01:03:43,706 --> 01:03:48,961
Don't be jealous. He'll be here
for all of us, won't he, Elisabeth?

347
01:03:49,044 --> 01:03:50,504
Yes,

348
01:03:50,587 --> 01:03:52,089
for all of you.

349
01:03:52,172 --> 01:03:55,009
We won't have much longer to wait.

350
01:03:55,092 --> 01:03:57,594
That's right, it's nearly midnight.

351
01:03:57,678 --> 01:04:01,390
- It's time to put on the costumes.
- I'll get them.

352
01:04:26,415 --> 01:04:27,916
Get undressed.

353
01:06:03,679 --> 01:06:05,931
That's good. You're very brave.

354
01:06:06,807 --> 01:06:09,101
Did you really think
that I would burn you?

355
01:06:09,852 --> 01:06:11,728
Is that all?

356
01:06:11,812 --> 01:06:15,482
I just wanted
to bring you down a bit.

357
01:06:15,566 --> 01:06:18,318
You're too bossy for my taste.

358
01:06:24,616 --> 01:06:27,953
The fifteen minutes are up.
It's nearly midnight.

359
01:06:34,251 --> 01:06:36,461
Now you're ours.

360
01:07:52,329 --> 01:07:55,082
The show's over now.

361
01:07:55,165 --> 01:07:58,919
I don't even want to know the secret
behind your little reunion.

362
01:07:59,002 --> 01:08:03,590
Perhaps your position shields you
from the murder of a girl like her,

363
01:08:03,674 --> 01:08:05,592
but it's not the same for me.

364
01:08:05,676 --> 01:08:09,346
I belong much more
to her world than to yours.

365
01:08:16,186 --> 01:08:17,980
Maybe Elisabeth was right.

366
01:08:18,605 --> 01:08:20,732
Perhaps you're Death.

367
01:08:21,566 --> 01:08:24,027
Perhaps you kill for amusement.

368
01:08:25,737 --> 01:08:27,364
I'm going.

369
01:08:28,282 --> 01:08:29,950
You're mistaken.

370
01:08:30,033 --> 01:08:34,037
That girl, who was actually your enemy
and wanted you dead,

371
01:08:34,121 --> 01:08:35,622
was killed accidentally.

372
01:08:35,706 --> 01:08:39,876
But what does it matter?
Nobody's going to keep you here.

373
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:44,047
Have my horse as a gift.
It's in the stables.

374
01:08:44,131 --> 01:08:49,177
You'll get away faster from here,
as we appear to frighten you so.

375
01:08:50,470 --> 01:08:51,722
Frightening?

376
01:08:51,805 --> 01:08:57,019
A bunch of bourgeois crackpots
playing questionable games?

377
01:10:35,492 --> 01:10:37,244
Why did you do that?

378
01:10:44,751 --> 01:10:46,294
You were mine.

379
01:10:47,921 --> 01:10:49,339
I loved you.

380
01:10:53,802 --> 01:10:55,637
That's enough! You're mad!

381
01:11:46,188 --> 01:11:48,398
You're not going to finish her off!

382
01:11:48,982 --> 01:11:50,984
Look at her blood running.

383
01:12:05,540 --> 01:12:08,335
Look... how the blood attracts them.

384
01:12:09,127 --> 01:12:11,171
They're coming nearer.

385
01:12:11,254 --> 01:12:12,797
They can see it.

386
01:12:12,881 --> 01:12:14,424
They want it!

387
01:12:14,508 --> 01:12:17,052
Stop!
You don't know what you're saying!

388
01:12:20,680 --> 01:12:24,267
Come, I'll tell you everything.

389
01:12:24,351 --> 01:12:25,727
Come!

390
01:13:34,087 --> 01:13:35,213
S'[Op!

391
01:14:32,187 --> 01:14:34,022
Aren't you coming, Helen?

392
01:14:34,105 --> 01:14:37,067
Come and satisfy your thirst, like us

393
01:14:41,237 --> 01:14:43,573
Hurry, she's still warm.

394
01:14:48,119 --> 01:14:51,873
Now we can rest.
It will soon be daylight.

395
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,359
The man and Elisabeth -

396
01:15:19,442 --> 01:15:21,277
They've both gone.

397
01:15:22,946 --> 01:15:25,365
He won't say anything.
He's on the run.

398
01:15:25,448 --> 01:15:28,451
Elisabeth will come back, I'm sure.

399
01:15:30,120 --> 01:15:32,038
She's too much like you.

400
01:16:30,680 --> 01:16:31,848
Elisabeth.

401
01:16:32,348 --> 01:16:33,641
Elisabeth.

402
01:16:34,684 --> 01:16:36,770
I love you too.

403
01:16:38,813 --> 01:16:40,857
Now tell me the truth.

404
01:16:41,441 --> 01:16:45,111
Your companions - who are they all?

405
01:16:45,695 --> 01:16:47,405
What is their secret?

406
01:16:51,034 --> 01:16:57,165
In the morning, some of us
go to an abattoir to drink fresh ox blood.

407
01:16:57,248 --> 01:17:00,168
On doctor's orders, of course.

408
01:17:00,251 --> 01:17:02,796
It's a cure for anemia.

409
01:17:02,879 --> 01:17:05,131
It's become very fashionable.

410
01:17:05,215 --> 01:17:09,803
Smart ladies meet gentlemen,
fashionable women see old admirers.

411
01:17:10,720 --> 01:17:13,223
But one day,

412
01:17:13,306 --> 01:17:18,686
a few high society girls decided
to try something other than ox blood.

413
01:17:19,813 --> 01:17:22,357
These girls meet at the château.

414
01:17:23,191 --> 01:17:29,697
Two of them come the evening before
and look for a male victim.

415
01:17:29,781 --> 01:17:33,576
He is sacrificed,
and the smart ladies drink his blood.

416
01:17:34,494 --> 01:17:37,330
When the servants return a bit later,

417
01:17:37,413 --> 01:17:39,958
all traces of the killing have gone.

418
01:17:40,333 --> 01:17:41,709
That's all.

419
01:17:43,878 --> 01:17:46,589
But it's completely mad!

420
01:17:48,424 --> 01:17:50,051
For the taste?

421
01:17:50,134 --> 01:17:52,720
For pleasure? Out of depravity?

422
01:17:52,804 --> 01:17:55,265
Why would they do something so dreadful?

423
01:17:59,185 --> 01:18:02,605
But you're not like that, are you?

424
01:18:02,689 --> 01:18:05,525
You love me. You saved me.

425
01:18:06,276 --> 01:18:09,696
We're going to get away
from these madwomen.

426
01:18:10,113 --> 01:18:11,698
Get away?

427
01:18:12,282 --> 01:18:13,783
Madwomen?

428
01:18:14,200 --> 01:18:15,577
Madwomen?

429
01:18:23,585 --> 01:18:24,836
Madwomen.

430
01:18:25,795 --> 01:18:28,798
Blood is the life which flows in you.

431
01:18:29,465 --> 01:18:32,635
But it's also death when it escapes,

432
01:18:32,719 --> 01:18:35,471
a true symbol of life and death.

433
01:18:36,764 --> 01:18:41,227
Perhaps there's no going back,
once it's touched your lips.

434
01:18:44,606 --> 01:18:48,651
But you do love me, don't you?

435
01:18:51,279 --> 01:18:55,283
I did love you, but remember,
you rejected me.

436
01:18:56,159 --> 01:18:58,119
I loved Eva

437
01:18:58,202 --> 01:18:59,996
and I killed her.

438
01:19:02,624 --> 01:19:06,252
The blood cult is strange, bizarre.

439
01:19:06,878 --> 01:19:12,467
The love of blood may be more
than that of the body in which it flows.

440
01:19:33,738 --> 01:19:35,365
Why?

441
01:19:36,449 --> 01:19:38,868
I don't think I ever loved you.

442
01:19:40,161 --> 01:19:45,041
What I liked about you was -

443
01:20:42,765 --> 01:20:44,684
Did I hear a shot?

444
01:20:46,310 --> 01:20:48,229
We were in the pigeon loft.

445
01:20:49,313 --> 01:20:51,024
He killed Eva.

446
01:20:51,107 --> 01:20:52,692
I killed him.

447
01:20:55,153 --> 01:20:59,282
You're beautiful like that,
with his blood on your mouth.
