<i>THE STUFF YOU SEE AROUND HERE,
WHICH IS JUST, LIKE,</i>



CAMERA EQUIPMENT
AND SO FORTH



IS-- IS VERY MUCH
A PART OF MY LIFE.



THIS-- THIS MAGAZINE
I HAVE RIGHT HERE--



THIS KA-61--



<i>THIS MAGAZINE,</i>



<i>UH, WAS WITH ME</i>
<i>ON THE DECK</i>



<i>WHEN I SHOT</i>
AMERICA AMERICA.



<i>DAD, CAN YOU TELL US
WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW AND--</i>



IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE
THE FUCK WE ARE RIGHT NOW,



JUST LOOK AROUND.



YOU'RE MAKING
A GODDAMN DOCUMENTARY,



<i>SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ME
SAY IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA



<i>WHERE WE ARE.



YOU DID A SHOT
OF SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT,



<i>DAD--</i> -YOU GET A SHOT
OF THE SIGN, YOU KNOW?



<i>DAD, YOU MIGHT WANT TO TELL US
THAT WE'RE IN YOUR EQUIPMENT ROOM,



<i>YOU'VE HAD IT</i>
<i>FOR SEVERAL YEARS,</i> <i>AND YOU--</i>



<i>WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY?</i>
<i>WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY?</i>



MARK, I--
LOOKIT.



DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKING, MY KIND,
ANYWAY, IS NOT SHOW-AND-TELL.



IN OTHER WORDS, I DON'T TELL
THEM WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN,



WHAT'S THE SCENE, AND SO FORTH.



IN OTHER WORDS,
IF YOU SHOOT A SCENE,



IF THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENS,



THEN IT WILL BE CLEAR
TO THE AUDIENCE.



THEN IT HAS
SOME VALIDITY.



OTHERWISE, IT LOSES
ITS... HONESTY.



<i>AND SO I'M TELLING YOU</i>
<i>TWO THINGS--</i>



<i>ONE IS, WHATEVER HAPPENS</i>
<i>IN THIS ROOM</i>



<i>IS GONNA HAPPEN</i>
<i>IN THIS ROOM.</i>



IF YOU GET IT,
THAT'S FINE.



IF YOU DON'T GET IT,
TOUGH SHIT.



<i>EVEN THOUGH I'VE MADE
SEVERAL DOCUMENTARIES IN THE PAST,</i>



<i>THE IDEA OF DOING</i>
<i>ONE OF MY FATHER</i> <i>SEEMS DAUNTING.</i>



<i>I RECOGNIZE ALL</i>
<i>MY DAD'S ACHIEVEMENTS,</i>



<i>AND I RESPECT HIS POSITION IN
THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN CINEMA,



<i>BUT I'M NOT EXACTLY</i>
<i>WHAT YOU'D CALL A FAN.</i>



<i>I'M A SON, THE SON</i>
<i>OF A FAMOUS FATHER,</i>



<i>AND I'VE SPENT MUCH OF MY
ADULT LIFE STRUGGLING TO STEP OUT



<i>FROM UNDER THE SHADOW</i>
<i>OF THAT FAME.</i>



<i>I REMEMBER HAVING DINNER</i>



<i>WITH YOU AND MARIAN</i>
<i>AND HASKELL</i>



<i>AT A RESTAURANT
IN LOS ANGELES.



AND WE CAME OUT,



AND THERE WAS SOMEONE THAT
YOU WANTED TO TALK TO,



BUT YOU WERE A LITTLE SHY
ABOUT APPROACHING THEM.



AND HASKELL TURNED
TO YOU AND SAID,



"GO AHEAD.
TELL THEM WHO YOU ARE".



AND YOUR MOTHER SAID,
"WHAT HE MEANS IS,



TELL THEM THAT YOU'RE
HASKELL WEXLER'S SON".



<i>AND WHO IS HASKELL WEXLER?</i>



<i>HE'S A CINEMATOGRAPHER.</i>



<i>OH!</i>



- WELL--
- ARE WE GONNA BE ON TV?



<i>SOME HAVE CALLED MY FATHER
THE BABE RUTH OF CINEMATOGRAPHY,</i>



<i>AND HE'S WORKED WITH</i>
<i>SUCH HEAVY HITTERS</i>



<i>AS JACK NICHOLSON,</i>
<i>ELIZABETH TAYLOR</i> <i>AND PAUL NEWMAN.</i>



<i>YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK
AT THE BODY OF WORK,</i>



<i>THE MOMENTS HE'S CREATED</i>
<i>OR CAPTURED OR INVENTED,</i>



<i>AND YOU GO,</i>



<i>"THIS IS ALMOST THE HISTORY</i>
<i>OF CONTEMPORARY FILM</i>



<i>HASKELL HAS HAD A HAND IN</i>



OR A CAMERA IN
OR A LENS IN".



<i>EVERY CINEMATOGRAPHER</i>



<i>HAS HIS OWN WAY OF
LOOKING AT THE WORLD.</i>



<i>IT'S LIKE, EVERY STILL
PHOTOGRAPHER OR EVERY PAINTER.</i>



<i>IN THE BEGINNING,</i>
<i>WHEN I WAS IN FILM SCHOOL,</i>



<i>I WAS VERY MUCH INTO THAT</i>



<i>VERY REALISTIC-LOOKING</i>
<i>PHOTOGRAPHY.</i>



AND THAT IS THE KIND OF
STYLE OF PHOTOGRAPHY



THAT, REALLY,
HASKELL SPECIALIZED IN.



<i>WE ALL HAVE OUR OWN INSTRUMENTS,</i>



<i>AND HASKELL'S</i>
<i>INSTRUMENT IS--</i>



<i>I ALWAYS THINK OF IT</i>
<i>AS THE HAND-HELD CAMERA.</i>



<i>HE'S A GREAT FILMMAKER</i>



<i>AND A GREAT</i>
<i>CINEMATOGRAPHER</i>



AND, OF COURSE,
A DEAR FRIEND.



<i>THE MINUTE I MET HIM
ON</i> COMING HOME,



I KNEW THAT THIS WAS
AS IT SHOULD BE-- IT WAS MAGICAL.



IT WAS MAGICAL.



<i>HE WAS SUCH A PERFECTIONIST</i>



<i>AND HE HAS SUCH A SKILL</i>
<i>AND A TALENT AND AN INSIGHT</i>



TO WHAT HE DID FOR A LIVING,
AND HE HAD SUCH PRIDE IN IT.



<i>YOUR FATHER WAS BORN</i>
<i>WITH MONEY,</i>



<i>BUT HE'S THE HARDEST WORKER</i>
<i>I'VE EVER SEEN,</i>



AND HIS FEELING FOR THE WORKERS
CERTAINLY PUTS HIM INTO A--



IT'S VERY MUCH LIKE
DIEGO RIVERA IN MY MIND.



<i>HE'S BEEN ARRESTED,
THROWN IN JAIL,</i>



<i>THREATENED WITH GUNS,



<i>THE F.B.I. PROBABLY</i>
<i>HAD A FILE ON HIM.</i>



<i>HE DIDN'T GIVE A DAMN,</i>
<i>YOU KNOW?</i>



HE'S WHAT I CALL
<i>A TRUE AMERICAN LIBERAL.</i>



AND PROBABLY NOT EVEN THAT.
HE'D PROBABLY HATE THAT WORD.



<i>BUT HE BELIEVES IN THE DOWNTRODDEN</i>



<i>AND THE DISPOSSESSED.</i>



<i>YOU KNOW, YOU CANNOT HELP</i>
<i>BUT ADMIRE THIS PERSON.</i>



<i>MY FATHER'S CAREER</i>
<i>AS A DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY</i>



<i>SPANS MORE THAN FIVE DECADES</i>
<i>OF WORKING IN FEATURES,</i>



<i>DOCUMENTARIES</i>
<i>AND COMMERCIALS.</i>



<i>HE'S EVEN WRITTEN, DIRECTED
AND PRODUCED HIS OWN FILMS.</i>



<i>BUT HE'S BEST KNOWN AND MOST
APPRECIATED FOR HIS CAMERA WORK.</i>



AMERICAN GRAFFITI
<i>WAS VERY FAST-PACED,</i>



<i>AND SO IT WAS A FILM</i>
<i>MADE IN CHAOS.</i>



<i>THE FIRST WEEK WE WERE</i>
<i>SHOOTING IN THE DRIVE-IN,</i>



<i>AND HE SAID, "WELL, WE'LL
MAKE THIS KIND OF LIKE A JUKE BOX,"



AND HE REALLY ADDED
A LOT OF QUALITY TO THE WHOLE THING



THAT I HADN'T REALLY
THOUGHT OF.



<i>EVERYBODY INVOLVED
IN THE MOVIE FROM THE ACTING SIDE</i>



<i>DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT
GEORGE LUCAS



<i>BUT WAS VERY IMPRESSED
THAT HASKELL WEXLER



<i>WAS KILLING HIMSELF</i>
<i>TO COME WORK ON THIS MOVIE.</i>



<i>I MEAN, IT WAS INSANE.</i>
<i>HE WOULD SHOOT</i>



<i>A COMMERCIAL DURING THE DAY</i>
<i>IN LOS ANGELES,</i>



<i>THEN FLY INTO SAN FRANCISCO,</i>
<i>DRIVE TO MARIN COUNTY</i>



WORK THERE UNTIL DAWN,
AND THEN GO GET ON A PLANE,



AND HE WAS DOING THIS, YOU KNOW,
NOT JUST ONCE IN A WHILE.



IT SEEMED LIKE HE WAS JUST
DOING IT THREE, FOUR NIGHTS A WEEK.



THEY CALL ME MR. TIBBS.



IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT
<i>FOLLOWED THE STORY</i>



<i>OF THIS BLACK DETECTIVE.</i>



THERE'S A SCENE
WHERE THEY PUT THE DOGS--



<i>YOU KNOW, THE SOUTHERNERS ARE</i>
<i>ALWAYS USING DOGS-- HOUNDS--</i>



<i>AND HE PUT THE BLOODHOUNDS</i>
<i>OR THE HOUNDS ON HIM.</i>



<i>OF COURSE, THERE WERE</i>
<i>NO STEADICAMS IN THOSE DAYS.</i>



YOUR DAD IS ALSO
A DIRECTOR,



SO I'M SURE THAT HE HAD
SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR NORMAN.



<i>YOUR DAD HAD A TINY,</i>
<i>LITTLE ECLAIR CAMERA--</i>



<i>IT SOUNDED LIKE</i>
<i>A COFFEE GRINDER--</i>



<i>AND HE USED TO</i>
<i>HAND-HOLD EVERYTHING.</i>



<i>SO HE GOT A COUPLE</i>
<i>OF TWO-BY-FOURS,</i>



<i>MOUNTED THE CAMERA</i>
<i>ABOUT THE HEIGHT OF A DOG,</i>



<i>AND, ON A WIDE-ANGLE LENS,</i>



<i>WE JUST FOLLOWED THIS GUY</i>
<i>THROUGH THE BUSH.</i>



BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOME
GOOD SHOTS THERE.



<i>MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN
ABOUT MY DAD.</i>



<i>HE'S A TWO-TIME</i>
<i>OSCAR WINNER,</i>



<i>A SOUGHT-AFTER VOICE</i>
<i>FOR DVD COMMENTARIES,</i>



<i>AND THE MOTION PICTURE ACADEMY</i>



<i>IS PREPARING AN ORAL
HISTORY ON HIS CAREER.



<i>PUSHING 80,</i>
<i>HE'S A RIPE SUBJECT</i> <i>FOR A TRIBUTE,</i>



<i>THOUGH I GUESS HE MAY HAVE SOME
SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT HIS SON



<i>PICKING UP THE CAMERA</i>
<i>AND TURNING THE LENS ON HIM.</i>



<i>I AM NOT THOSE PICTURES.</i>



<i>I AM HASKELL WEXLER</i>
<i>AND YOU'RE MY SON.</i>



<i>NOW, I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY</i>



<i>YOU WANT TO TALK TO</i>
<i>SOME OF THE WELL-KNOWN PEOPLE</i>



<i>WHO HAVE BEEN</i>
<i>IN MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE--</i>



OH, HASKELL!



I MEAN, WHAT-- WHAT DOES
AN ACTOR SAY ABOUT A LEGEND?



BUT I DON'T WANT
THAT KIND OF BIOGRAPHY.



<i>I'M NOT GONNA SAY I WAS
LIKE A SON TO HIM,</i>



BUT IT WAS
SORT OF LIKE THAT.



I WAS, LIKE, THE STUDENT
AND HE WAS, LIKE, THE TEACHER.



I WOULD LIKE TO
BE ABLE TO USE



OUR FILMMAKING-- MAYBE EVEN
ABOUT EACH OTHER A LITTLE BIT--



TO BREAK DOWN SOME OF THE
WALLS THAT-- THAT HAPPEN



AS WITH ANY
FATHERS AND SONS AS THEY GET OLDER



AND THEY GET
MORE INDEPENDENT.



<i>SO WHAT'S HE SAYING?</i>



<i>NO STORIES ABOUT LIZ TAYLOR</i>



<i>FEELING UP HIS LIGHT METER</i>
<i>ON</i> VIRGINIA WOOLF?



<i>NO STORIES ABOUT
HIM GETTING FIRED



<i>AND RE-HIRED BY A
COKED-UP HAL ASHBY?



<i>NO STORIES ABOUT
HOW HE'D LOAN



<i>LITTLE RONNIE HOWARD
GRIP EQUIPMENT



<i>TO MAKE HIS FIRST</i>
<i>STUDENT FILMS?</i>



<i>NO MENTION OF</i>
CANADIAN BACON, BLAZE,



UNCLE MEAT
<i>OR</i> THE LOVED ONE?



<i>YOU MEAN, I'LL HAVE TO</i>
<i>SCRAP THAT GREAT INTERVIEW</i>



<i>WITH JONATHAN WINTERS?</i>



I'VE GOT YOU IN THIS FRAME.
I'M NOT FRAMING YOU.



I'VE JUST GOT YOU
IN THIS FRAME MOMENTARILY.



<i>I JUST THINK THAT</i> <i>IT WOULD BE</i>



<i>A MORE INTERESTING</i>
<i>AND DIFFERENT FILM</i>



<i>IF WE HAD</i>
<i>ENOUGH NERVE, REALLY,</i>



<i>TO REVEAL CERTAIN FEELINGS,</i>
<i>CERTAIN THOUGHTS,</i>



<i>CERTAIN THINGS ABOUT MARIAN,</i>



<i>CERTAIN THINGS ABOUT</i>
<i>YOUR CHILDHOOD,</i>



<i>CERTAIN THINGS ABOUT...</i>



ME AND MY GIRLFRIENDS,
YOU KNOW?



UM, THOSE THINGS
WHICH, UM--



WHICH ARE MORE PROFOUND THAN
JUST THE PROFESSIONAL THINGS.



<i>LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,</i>



WE PROUDLY WELCOME
TO THE HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME



MR. HASKELL WEXLER.
THERE IT IS.



<i>IT'S ACCURATE TO SAY</i>



<i>THAT WHAT I DO</i>
<i>FOR A LIVING,</i>



<i>WHICH IS MAKING MOVIES,</i>
<i>IS NOT ME.</i>



<i>AND IF YOU WANT TO MAKE



<i>THE KIND OF DOCUMENTARY
I HOPE WE'RE MAKING,



<i>AT SOME POINT,</i>
<i>WE HAVE TO GET OUT</i> <i>OF HOLLYWOOD</i>



AND INTO, UH--



INTO HERE, INTO HERE.



I CUT YOUR HEADS OFF
JUST PERFECT RIGHT HERE.



FIVE BUCKS.



<i>TO BE HONEST,</i>
<i>I NEVER THOUGHT OF MY FATHER</i>



<i>AS SOMEONE WHO WAS WILLING TO
SHARE HIS MORE PERSONAL SIDE.



- CONGRATULATIONS, HASKELL!
- <i>BUT I'M GAME IF HE IS.</i>



<i>I'M SURPRISED THAT AFTER SUCH A
HIGH-PROFILE CAREER IN FILMS,



<i>HE SUDDENLY DOESN'T WANT</i>
<i>TO BE DEFINED BY IT.</i>



<i>BUT IF HE'S NOT HIS WORK,</i>
<i>THEN WHO IS HE?</i>



<i>HASKELL WEXLER,</i>
<i>THE HOLLYWOOD LIBERAL?</i>



<i>HASKELL WEXLER,</i>
<i>THE LADIES' MAN?</i>



<i>HASKELL WEXLER,</i>
<i>THE CAR COLLECTOR?</i>



<i>WHAT I REALLY WANT</i>
<i>TO EXPLORE,</i>



<i>AND MAYBE THIS FILM IS</i>
<i>THE WAY TO DO IT,</i>



<i>IS WHO HASKELL WEXLER,</i>
<i>THE FATHER, IS.</i>



<i>WHAT ARE YOU DOING?</i>



MARK, I-I'M DOING--



AND IT'S VERY CLEAR--
I DO WHAT I ALWAYS DO.



I TAKE THE <i>NEW YORK TIMES</i>
OBITUARY AVERAGE.



I HAVE...



A WRITER/PSYCHOLOGIST--
87 YEARS OLD.



MICHAEL DE LISIO, 91,
A SCULPTOR.



AND BURTON FELDMAN, 76.



WELL, HE KNOCKED IT DOWN,
BUT STILL



THE AVERAGE
SHOULD HAVE ME LIVING



AT LEAST ANOTHER
YEAR AND A HALF... AT LEAST.



<i>MY DAD THINKS A LOT</i>
<i>ABOUT HIS AGE THESE DAYS.</i>



<i>I GUESS THE PARTY WE THREW</i>
<i>FOR HIS 80th BIRTHDAY</i>



<i>DIDN'T EXACTLY TAKE</i>
<i>HIS MIND OFF IT EITHER,</i>



<i>BUT IT WAS QUITE</i>
<i>A DAY TO REMEMBER.</i>



<i>MY HALF-BROTHER AND -SISTER,</i>
<i>JEFF AND KATHY, WERE THERE.</i>



<i>THEY ARE THE CHILDREN</i>
<i>FROM MY FATHER'S</i> <i>FIRST MARRIAGE.</i>



<i>I'M THE ONLY CHILD</i>
<i>FROM THE SECOND MARRIAGE.</i>



<i>HIS THIRD WIFE, RITA,</i>
<i>PUT THE WHOLE PARTY TOGETHER,</i>



<i>AND I THOUGHT IT</i>
<i>A GOOD IDEA TO TAPE IT.</i>



<i>IT WOULD BE GREAT TO GET
SOME TESTIMONIALS



<i>AND SOME FUNNY BIRTHDAY SPEECHES.



<i>SOME OF THESE GUYS CAN BE</i>
<i>REAL CUTUPS.</i>



IF YOU'RE DOING TELEVISION,
YOU SHOULD USE THIS CAMERA.



<i>MANY WERE OLD FAMILY FRIENDS,</i>
<i>BUT SINCE I WAS BEHIND</i> <i>THE CAMERA,</i>



<i>IT MADE ME A BIT NERVOUS TO HAVE
SO MANY SUCCESSFUL FILMMAKERS



<i>WATCHING MY EVERY MOVE.</i>



THE WEAK POINT IS,
WHO'S BEHIND IT, AND--



<i>WAIT A SECOND!</i>



BUT THE SOUND, REALLY.



I'M NOT GONNA GO ON A DOCUMENTARY
WITHOUT HAVING A SOUND PERSON.



NO, YOU STILL DO NEED
A SOUND GUY WITH A BOOM.



<i>I SHOULD'VE
TAKEN THEIR ADVICE</i>



<i>AND HIRED A SEPARATE SOUND MAN.</i>



<i>I DIDN'T REALIZE UNTIL LATER</i>
<i>THAT MY MIC CONNECTION FAILED,</i>



<i>AND SO I HAVE TWO HOURS</i>
<i>OF UNUSABLE FOOTAGE.</i>



<i>I DON'T WANT TO TELL</i>
<i>MY DAD ABOUT MY SCREW-UP.</i>



<i>THERE'S A LOT MORE SHOOTING</i>
<i>TO DO WITH HIM,</i>



<i>AND I NEED HIM TO TRUST ME</i>
<i>AS A FILMMAKER.</i>



I JUST WANT-- I JUST
WANT SOMETHING IN THE MIRROR.



NOW, MARK, WE STARTED THERE,
AND WHY DID WE STOP?



- THERE'S A FOCUS PROBLEM?
- YEAH.



WHOSE FOCUS PROBLEM?
IT LOOKS LIKE MY CAMERA'S IN FOCUS.



<i>YOU KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN AROUND
THREE DIFFERENT ANGLES NOW.



<i>DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE A
PERFECTIONIST OR YOU DON'T KNOW



<i>WHAT THE HELL</i>
<i>YOU'RE DOING?</i>



<i>TURN-TURN</i>
<i>YOUR HEAD THIS WAY.</i>



PRETTY SOON WE'D BETTER
GET TO THE SUBJECT



OF YOUR GODDAMN SHOW,



BECAUSE, UM,
I'VE GOT FISH TO FRY.



<i>MY DAD'S FATHER,
SIMON WEXLER, MADE HIS FORTUNE</i>



<i>IN THE EARLY DAYS</i>
<i>OF THE ELECTRONICS BUSINESS.</i>



<i>DURING THE DEPRESSION, HIS FAMILY
WAS ONE OF THE FEW THAT PROSPERED,



<i>TAKING LAVISH TRIPS ABROAD</i>
<i>AND ENROLLING THE CHILDREN</i>



<i>IN EXPENSIVE PRIVATE SCHOOLS.</i>



<i>MY FATHER WAS NEVER
COMFORTABLE AS THE BOSS'S SON,



<i>AND OFTEN TRIED TO REBEL</i>
<i>AGAINST HIS PRIVILEGED</i> <i>HOME LIFE.</i>



<i>IN JUNIOR HIGH,</i>



<i>HE AND FRIEND BARNEY ROSSET</i>
<i>PUBLISHED A WEEKLY NEWSLETTER</i>



<i>CALLED</i> AGAINST EVERYTHING.



<i>LATER, HE'D HELP</i>
<i>ORGANIZE A STRIKE</i> <i>BY THE WORKERS</i>



<i>IN HIS FATHER'S FACTORY.</i>



<i>AND ALL DURING THE WAR,</i> <i>YOU KNOW,</i>



<i>I HAD ALL KINDS OF THINGS
WHICH WERE EXCITING



<i>AND INTERESTING TO ME.



<i>I LEARNED TO, UH, NAVIGATE.</i>
<i>I BECAME A SECOND OFFICER.</i>



<i>UM, I FELT</i>
<i>I WAS A MAN.</i>



<i>DURING WORLD WAR ll, DAD'S
MERCHANT MARINES SUPPLY SHIP</i>



<i>WAS TORPEDOED BY THE GERMANS</i>
<i>IN THE INDIAN OCEAN.</i>



<i>HE SPENT TEN DAYS</i>
<i>IN A LIFE BOAT</i>



<i>STRUGGLING WITH 20 OTHER</i>
<i>MERCHANT SEAMEN TO STAY ALIVE.</i>



<i>CERTAINLY, THE WHOLE WAY</i>
<i>I DEALT WITH THE WAR EXPERIENCE</i>



<i>MADE ME FEEL CONFIDENT</i>



<i>THAT I WAS, UH,</i>
<i>MY OWN PERSON.</i>



<i>I GUESS I FELT THAT</i>
<i>WORKING FOR MY DAD</i>



<i>WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR ME.</i>



<i>MY DAD HAD A 16-MILLIMETER</i>
<i>BELL & HOWELL CAMERA</i>



<i>BACK WHEN</i>
<i>THEY WERE VERY RARE,</i>



<i>BUT I HAD MADE</i>
<i>SOME FAMILY MOVIES</i>



AND I LIKED THAT
VERY MUCH.



UH, I THINK, IN RETROSPECT,
WHAT I LIKED ABOUT IT



<i>IS THAT IDEA</i>
<i>OF BEING THERE,</i>



<i>BUT BEING THE OBSERVER.</i>



<i>UH, BEING THERE AND, UH,</i>
<i>NOT BEING THERE, IN A SENSE.</i>



<i>IN TIME,
MY DAD'S FATHER</i>



<i>WOULD HELP HIM
PURSUE HIS AMBITIONS</i>



<i>BY INVESTING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
TO SET UP A SMALL MOVIE STUDIO



<i>IN DES PLAINES, ILLINOIS.</i>



<i>I MADE THIS FILM CALLED</i>
HALF CENTURY WITH COTTON,



<i>AND I WENT DOWN THERE</i>
<i>LIKE A DOCUMENTARIAN,</i>



<i>AND I SHOT FOOTAGE</i>
<i>OF THIS COTTON-MILL TOWN</i>



<i>WHERE THE COMPANY OWNED
THE HOUSES THAT PEOPLE LIVED IN.



<i>PEACE, COMFORT, SECURITY.</i>



<i>THESE ARE TRADITIONAL WITH</i>
<i>OPELIKA MILLS WORKERS.</i>



<i>WHEN I BROUGHT THE FILM
FOR HERBIE SNOWER TO SEE--</i>



<i>THE HEAD OF THE COMPANY--</i>
<i>HE SAID, "WHAT IS ALL THIS SHIT</i>



<i>ABOUT THE KIDS GOING TO SCHOOL?</i>



<i>I WANT TO SEE</i>
<i>MY CARDING MACHINES.</i>



<i>I HAVE 30 CARDING MACHINES,</i>
<i>AND THEY COST $8,500 A PIECE.</i>



IT'S ABOUT MY COTTON MILL".



<i>SO I HAD TO GO BACK DOWN</i>
<i>TO OPELIKA, ALABAMA,</i>



<i>WITH A FULL UNION CREW,</i>



<i>BECAUSE I NEEDED</i>
<i>TO USE BIG LIGHTS</i>



<i>TO LIGHT UP HUGE INTERIORS</i>
<i>OF THE FACTORY</i>



<i>TO MAKE THESE LOOSE SHOTS</i>



<i>WHICH ATE INTO</i>
<i>WHATEVER PROFIT</i>



<i>I WOULD EVER HAVE MADE</i>
<i>ON THAT FILM,</i>



<i>BUT I WAS OBLIGED</i>
<i>TO DO THAT.</i>



<i>HIS FATHER HAD INVESTED</i>



<i>CLOSE TO A MILLION DOLLARS IN HIM.</i>



<i>AND HASKELL TOLD ME</i>
<i>WHAT HIS FATHER SAID TO HIM.</i>



HE SAYS, "YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE A MAGICIAN.



YOU CAN TAKE GOOD MONEY
AND TURN IT INTO <i>SHIT</i>".



<i>THAT HIT ME VERY HARD.</i>



<i>I MEAN, THAT WAS A STATEMENT</i>
<i>FOR SOMEBODY TO MAKE</i>



<i>ABOUT THE FATHER</i>
<i>SAYING IT.</i>



<i>BUT IT WAS</i>
<i>JUST A FACT--</i>



<i>HE DIDN'T MAKE IT</i>
<i>IN CHICAGO.</i>



<i>THAT LESS-THAN-FAVORABLE</i>
<i>COMMENT FROM HIS FATHER</i>



<i>DIDN'T HAMPER MY DAD'S</i>
<i>FILMMAKING PURSUITS.</i>



<i>HE GAVE UP HIS STUDIO</i>
<i>AND WENT TO WORK</i>



<i>AS A FREELANCE CAMERAMAN,</i>
<i>A GUN FOR HIRE,</i>



<i>AND OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS</i>
<i>SHOT SPORTS,</i>



<i>EDUCATIONAL FILMS</i>
<i>AND SHORT SUBJECTS,</i>



<i>TWO OF WHICH WERE NOMINATED</i>
<i>FOR ACADEMY AWARDS.</i>



<i>MY FAVORITE WAS A SHORT FILM</i>
<i>HE PHOTOGRAPHED FOR</i>



<i>LEWIS CLYDE STALLMAN</i>



<i>ABOUT A TUMBLEWEED'S JOURNEY</i>
<i>THROUGH THE DESERT.</i>



<i>SO MANY OF THESE DOCUMENTARIES</i>
<i>ARE DRY AND DIDACTIC.</i>



<i>THIS FILM WAS WITTY</i>
<i>AND WHIMSICAL, FOR A CHANGE.</i>



<i>BY NOW, HE WAS DEVELOPING A SOLID
REPUTATION AS A CINEMATOGRAPHER,



<i>AND SOON, HOLLYWOOD DIRECTORS</i>
<i>CAME KNOCKING.</i>



<i>HE WOULD EVENTUALLY WIN</i>
<i>TWO ACADEMY AWARDS--</i>



<i>ONE FOR</i> WHO'S AFRAID
OF VIRGINIA WOOLF <i>IN 1966</i>



<i>AND THE OTHER FOR</i>
BOUND FOR GLORY <i>IN 1976.</i>



♪ MAY BE THE LAST TIME
WE MARCH IN WASHINGTON ♪



♪ MAY BE THE LAST
TIME BUT I DON'T KNOW ♪



<i>BUT BACK IN THE EARLY '60s</i>



<i>HE WAS FOLLOWING</i>
<i>HIS FIRST LOVE, DOCUMENTARIES.</i>



<i>OVERTLY POLITICAL IN NATURE,</i>
<i>HIS FILM</i> THE BUS,



<i>ABOUT THE 1963 CIVIL RIGHTS</i>
<i>MARCH ON WASHINGTON,</i>



<i>WOULD SET A LEFT-WING
ACTIVIST COURSE



<i>THAT HE WOULD PURSUE RELENTLESSLY.



<i>IT ALSO ESTABLISHED
HIM AS A PIONEER



<i>OF A NEW STYLE OF DOCUMENTARY



<i>CALLED CINEMA VERITE.</i>



THIS IS THE THING.



WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS
THE ETHIC OF THE WHOLE THING.



YOU ARE WILLING TO GET OFF
OF THIS BUS ANYTIME-- YOU KNOW



THAT YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO BE BOTHERED.



NO ONE'S GONNA CALL YOU DOWN
"NIGGER-LOVER" OR "NIGGER".



YOU-- LET ME FINISH!
LET ME FINISH!



<i>CINEMA VERITE-- OR WE PREFER
THE TERM "DIRECT CINEMA"--</i>



<i>IT HAS TO BE TRUTHFUL</i>
<i>IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE</i>



<i>A DOCUMENTARY,</i>
<i>IN MY BELIEF.</i>



AND UNFORTUNATELY, SO MANY
PEOPLE MAKING DOCUMENTARIES



DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF CONFIDENCE
THAT THEY CAN GET TO THE TRUTH.



<i>AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT,</i>
<i>I THINK,</i>



<i>IS THAT YOU REALLY LIKE</i>
<i>THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE FILMING,</i>



<i>THAT YOU EMPATHIZE WITH THEM,</i>
<i>THAT AS YOU LOOK AT THEM,</i>



<i>EVEN ESPECIALLY THE FIRST
MOMENT YOU MEET SOMEBODY,</i>



<i>THAT PERSON LOOKS BACK</i>
<i>AT YOU AND SAYS TO THEMSELVES,</i>



"I CAN TRUST THIS GUY".



- HEY, MARK?
- <i>YEAH?</i>



YOU WANT TO GO
TO BREAKFAST WITH ME?



WE'RE GOING TO WALK
DOWN TO PEABODY'S,



AND YOU'LL SEE SOMETHING
OF THE SEMI-RURAL, SUBURBAN,



RICH-PEOPLE'S LIFE
OF MONTECITO, AND ON THE WAY,



WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN GET
SOMETHING USEFUL.



UH, NOW,
I'M GOING OUT THE DOOR.



I CAN SUGGEST
THAT YOU CUT NOW.



I THINK THAT YOU'LL
FIND OUT A LOT ABOUT



FATHER-AND-SON
RELATIONSHIPS



IF YOU'RE DOING
SOMETHING TOGETHER.



<i>SO FAR, YOU'VE BEEN</i>
<i>REALLY DELICATE</i>



<i>ABOUT ISSUES,</i>
<i>YOU KNOW?</i>



<i>I MEAN, SOMETIMES THEY USE THE
WORD "ISSUES" MEANING "FATHER"--



<i>YOU KNOW,</i>
<i>"HE IS THE ISSUE OF SUCH--</i>



<i>OF THIS MOTHER</i>
<i>AND THIS FATHER".</i>



<i>BUT AS FAR AS</i>
<i>THE ISSUES AND THE IDEAS,</i>



<i>WE HAVEN'T GONE INTO THAT</i>
<i>MUCH YET, HAVE WE?</i>



UH, NO.



OKAY.
THE ROAD'S CLEAR.



<i>I HEARD OPRAH
MOVED HERE TO MONTECITO.</i>



UH, YEAH.
OPRAH'S HERE.



I HOPE IT DOESN'T, UH,
RUIN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.



- HI.
- HELLO. THERE'S TWO.



WAIT A SECOND.
HEY, MARK, YOU WANT TO--



- HEY, JOE! HEY, LISTEN.
- HI, GUYS.



UH, I WANT YOU
TO MEET MY SON MARK-- MARKO.



- THIS IS JOE.
- HI. HOW ARE YOU?



NICE TO MEET YOU.



WHAT THIS IS IS EGG WHITES
WITH VEGETABLES AND TOMATOES.



THIS IS NOT ON THE MENU.
THIS IS WHAT HE MAKES UP FOR ME.



<i>YOU MAKING THIS FILM--</i>



<i>IT CAN BE</i>
<i>A USEFUL PROCESS FOR US,</i>



AND IT'S A WEIRD WAY
TO GO THROUGH



A PROCESS, THROUGH A--
THROUGH A MACHINE,



UM, BUT, UH,



ITS A WAY-- IN A WAY
HAS WORKED FOR YOU.



WHEN YOU MADE
THE <i>MATCHMAKER</i> FILM,



<i>UH, YOU WERE GOING</i>
<i>THROUGH A PROCESS.</i>



<i>THE FACT THAT IT TURNED OUT</i>
<i>TO BE A GOOD FILM WAS A PLUS.</i>



<i>HE'S REFERRING TO</i>
<i>A DOCUMENTARY I MADE IN 1996</i>



<i>ABOUT A JEWISH MATCHMAKER AND
HOW SHE COMPLICATED MY DATING LIFE



<i>WHEN I WAS LIVING</i>
<i>IN CHICAGO.</i>



MOST OF OUR PROBLEMS



START AS OUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH OUR PARENTS.



<i>WHAT DO YOU THINK, MARK?</i>
<i>DID YOUR MOTHER REJECT YOU?</i>



<i>MY FATHER REJECTED</i> <i>MY MOTHER,</i>



<i>AND MY MOTHER THINKS</i>
<i>THAT ALL MEN ARE BEASTS,</i>



<i>AND I DON'T WANT TO BE A BEAST.</i>



<i>I GUESS WHAT I MEANT</i> <i>BY THAT IS,</i>



<i>I DON'T WANT</i>
<i>TO BE MY FATHER.</i>



<i>EVEN WHEN I WAS A CHILD,</i>
<i>I SUSPECTED HE HAD AFFAIRS,</i>



<i>THOUGH HE'D VEHEMENTLY</i>
<i>DENY IT, CALLING ME CRAZY</i>



<i>FOR EVEN SUGGESTING</i>
<i>SUCH A THING.</i>



OH, AND HERE'S ONE
OF YOUR FATHER.



<i>MY MOTHER IS AN ARTIST</i>
<i>IN HER OWN RIGHT...</i> -CAN YOU SEE IT?



<i>...A PAINTER. I THINK
THAT'S WHAT ATTRACTED MY DAD



<i>TO HER</i>
<i>FROM THE BEGINNING.</i>



<i>THAT AND THE FACT THAT SHE CAME
FROM A WORKING-CLASS BACKGROUND



<i>AND WASN'T A CHILD</i>
<i>OF PRIVILEGE LIKE HIM.</i>



<i>MY MOM IS VERY DOWN-TO-EARTH,</i>



<i>AND THE WHOLE HOLLYWOOD SCENE</i>
<i>NEVER IMPRESSED HER MUCH.</i>



<i>MY DAD WOULD OFTEN GO AWAY</i>
<i>ON LOCATION WITH A FILM CREW.</i>



<i>MY MOM NEVER COMPLAINED</i>
<i>ABOUT IT, BUT I GOT THE SENSE</i>



<i>THAT SHE KIND OF</i>
<i>RESENTED IT.</i>



<i>STILL, IT DID GIVE HER TIME</i>
<i>ALONE TO FOCUS ON HER OWN WORK.</i>



<i>ULTIMATELY, I GUESS,</i>
<i>THEY LIVED VERY SEPARATE LIVES.</i>



<i>AFTER 30 YEARS OF MARRIAGE,</i>
<i>THEY FINALLY SPLIT UP.</i>



- DAD!
- YES, MARKO.



DUELING CAMERAS.
OH, IT'S COMPACT.



- <i>DO YOU LIKE THAT?</i>
- LOOKS GOOD. YEAH.



<i>GOD!</i>
<i>IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD!</i>



<i>SEE THAT?</i>



<i>DAD, I'VE GOT A SORT OF BELATED</i>
<i>BIRTHDAY PRESENT FOR YOU.</i>



<i>IT'S IN THE CAR. CAN YOU COME
WITH ME? I WANT TO GIVE IT TO YOU.



DON'T DIRECT ME.
JUST DO IT. I'LL-- I'LL--



YOU'D BE SURPRISED.



<i>I MEANT TO, UH, GIVE THIS
TO YOU ON YOUR BIRTHDAY, BUT--



THERE IS A CERTAIN MAGIC
TO, UH, FILM.



AND WE'RE THE MAGICIANS,
THE CAMERAMEN.



NOW, UM, EVERYBODY
CAN LOOK AT IT



<i>AND EVERYONE CAN FEEL LIKE,
"WHAT THE HELL, I CAN DO THAT".



THE MAGICIAN IS PART
OF THE CHEMISTRY,



AND THE CHEMISTRY IS-IS GONE,
PRETTY MUCH,



WHEN YOU GET INTO VIDEO.



<i>OKAY. SO HERE WE GO.</i>



<i>GO AHEAD.</i>



<i>I MADE A PRETTY GOOD CHANGE</i>
<i>IN THE LIGHT LEVEL.</i>



IT'S A LITTLE PICTURE FOR YOUR WALL.



OH, YEAH. WELL--



- IT'S ME AND--
- OH, YOU AND GEORGE BUSH.



UH-HUH.



<i>THAT PHOTO OF ME AND GEORGE
BUSH WAS TAKEN TWO YEARS AGO</i>



<i>WHEN I PRODUCED
A DOCUMENTARY FOR</i>



NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC
<i>ON AIR FORCE ONE.</i>



<i>WHILE MAKING THAT FILM,



<i>I GOT TO SPEND TIME WITH
THREE U.S. EX-PRESIDENTS



<i>AND FLY IN THE AIRCRAFT</i>
<i>WITH THEN-PRESIDENT</i> <i>BILL CLINTON.</i>



<i>IT WAS AN EXPERIENCE</i>
<i>I'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER.</i>



<i>IT ONLY SAYS</i> <i>ONE THING TO ME.</i>



IT SAYS THAT "I'M MARK
AND I'M DIFFERENT FROM YOU".



AND I HAVE TO SAY TO MYSELF
RATHER THAN GETTING PISSED AT YOU



THAT THAT'S FINE, MARK.
YOU CAN BE MARK.



I GET THE SAME ENJOYMENT WHEN THE
CAPTAIN FROM THE <i>AIR FORCE ONE</i>



CALLS YOU
ON THE COMPUTER.



I-I SHARE THAT WITH YOU.
I THINK IT'S GREAT.



AND I DON'T THINK
I'M ANY LESS A LEFTIST



FOR FEELING HAPPY
ABOUT SUCH A SITUATION.



IS THIS BEDSIDE READING?



THIS IS MY
BEDSIDE READING.



<i>"WHEN CORPORATIONS</i>
<i>RULE THE WORLD".</i>



- YEAH.
- <i>WOW.</i>



TERRIFIC BOOK.



<i>THAT SOUNDS</i>
<i>REALLY ROMANTIC.</i>



UM-- OH, IT IS.
YEAH.



BECAUSE IT SHOWS HOW
CORPORATIONS FUCK PEOPLE.



WELL, YOU KNOW,
HASKELL'S POLITICAL AGENDA



HAS ALWAYS BEEN VERY
IN THE FOREFRONT OF THINGS.



AND THAT HAS MADE HIM
A VERY COLORFUL INDIVIDUAL.



AND A LOT OF THE RUN-INS
I THINK HE'S HAD



UH, HAVE CENTERED AROUND
THAT PARTICULAR ASPECT.



<i>I WAS A BIG FAN</i>
<i>OF HASKELL AS A PERSON</i>



<i>AND AS A FILMMAKER.</i>



<i>AND I REALLY WANTED US</i>
<i>TO MAKE A PICTURE WITH HIM.</i>



<i>THE EVENTS OF THE LATE '60s</i>
<i>WERE SO INTERESTING</i>



<i>THAT IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL</i>
<i>TO BE IN TOUCH WITH FILMMAKERS</i>



<i>WHO WEREN'T INTENT ON
PROPAGATING HOLLYWOOD MYTHS



BUT WERE ACTUALLY



INTERESTED IN MAKING
PICTURES ABOUT THE REAL WORLD.



EVERYTHING'S BEEN CLAMPED DOWN
AND HISTORY'S BEEN CHANGED



AND REWRITTEN SINCE '68,
SO WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE--



<i>WE WERE DISCUSSING</i>
<i>DIFFERENT PROPERTIES</i>



<i>THAT HE MIGHT</i>
<i>UNDERTAKE,</i>



<i>AND THERE WAS A BOOK</i>
<i>CALLED</i> THE CONCRETE WILDERNESS



THAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE
AN ARRESTING MOVIE.



AND IT SEEMED LIKE WE WERE
ABOUT TO MAKE THAT MOVIE.



<i>TO PUT IT IN</i>
<i>CLASSIC HOLLYWOOD TALK,</i>



<i>WE GAVE HIM</i>
<i>A DEVELOPMENT DEAL,</i>



<i>AND BEING AN ANARCHIST</i>
<i>BY NATURE,</i>



<i>HE DERAILED IT AND CAME UP</i>
<i>WITH A BETTER IDEA.</i>



MEDIUM COOL <i>HAS MANY THEMES.</i>



<i>THE MAIN THEME HAD TO DO</i>
<i>WITH CONSCIENCE,</i>



<i>BECAUSE IT RAISED</i>
<i>MORAL ISSUES--</i>



<i>ISSUES OF RELATIONSHIP</i>
<i>TO THE MEDIA;</i>



THOUGHTS ABOUT WHEN
YOU PUT THE CAMERA DOWN



<i>AND-AND-AND</i>
<i>BECOME A PARTICIPANT</i>



<i>OR WHEN YOU SHOULD</i>
<i>BE A VIEWER.</i>



<i>I'M VERY PROUD</i>
<i>OF THE FILM.</i>



<i>I'M VERY PROUD</i>
<i>OF THE FILM.</i>



<i>WHEN DID YOU SEE</i> MEDIUM COOL?



I'VE NEVER SEEN <i>MEDIUM COOL,</i>
BUT I COLLECT MOVIE MEMORABILIA



SO I KNEW WHEN I SPOTTED THIS
AT A TRADE SHOW



THAT IT WAS KIND OF A RARE FILM



TO GET A POSTER ON,
SO I SCOOPED IT RIGHT UP.



<i>THE MIXTURE OF FICTION
AND SO-CALLED REALITY</i>



<i>IS INHERENT IN</i> MEDIUM COOL.



<i>I THOUGHT</i> MEDIUM COOL
<i>WAS ONE OF THE MORE</i>



<i>ACCURATE WAYS TO LOOK AT</i>
<i>THAT SUMMER IN CHICAGO</i>



<i>WITH THE CLOUDS OF PROTEST AND
GATHERING IN THE BACKGROUND



<i>AS THESE PEOPLE</i>
<i>IN THE FOREGROUND</i>



YOU KNOW, TRIED TO
LEAD THEIR LIVES.



<i>FUCK YOU!</i>



IT'S A DOCUMENTARY FILM,
AND YET IT IS NOT.



IT IS DOCUMENTARY,



AND YET THERE ARE
A FEW ACTORS IN IT KEEPING IT GOING.



<i>THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT
WHEN YOU'RE NOT YOURSELF,</i>



<i>WHEN YOU'RE ANOTHER PERSON</i>
<i>AND THERE ARE CAMERAS AROUND.</i>



<i>EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW WHAT IS</i>
<i>IN THE BACKGROUND IS REAL,</i>



<i>THE SITUATION</i>
<i>THAT YOU'RE IN</i> <i>IS MAKE-BELIEVE.</i>



AND SO YOU HAVE A FALSE
SENSE OF SECURITY.



<i>THERE WAS ONE SCENE</i>
<i>WHEN HASKELL WANTED ME</i>



<i>TO GO UP TO</i>
<i>A POLICE OFFICER</i>



<i>AND ASK HIM FOR HELP</i>



<i>TO FIND MY-MY CHILD.</i>



<i>AND WE WANTED TO SEE</i>
<i>HOW I WOULD BE TREATED.</i>



<i>SIG HEIL!</i> <i>SIG HEIL! SIG HEIL!</i>



<i>NO MORE WAR!</i>



<i>ACTUALLY, IT WAS</i>
<i>A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING,</i>



<i>BECAUSE HE DIDN'T DO</i>
<i>ANYTHING TO ME</i>



<i>FOR ME TO REACT OFF OF.</i>



<i>JOIN US! JOIN US!



<i>FIRST OF ALL, THE RIOTS</i>
<i>WERE WRITTEN INTO THE SCRIPT</i>



BEFORE THEY EVER HAPPENED.



<i>I WAS PART OF</i> <i>THE ANTI-WAR MOVEMENT,</i>



<i>AND I KNEW THE ANTI-WAR</i>
<i>MOVEMENT WAS PLANNING</i>



TO BE IN CHICAGO
AT THAT TIME.



SO I INCORPORATED THAT
IN THE SCRIPT.



AND THEN COMES
THE BIG ONE.



<i>WHEN WE HEAR A VOICE,</i>



<i>ONE OF HASKELL'S COLLEAGUES,</i>
<i>THE CO-PRODUCER, JONATHAN HAZE.</i>



<i>LOOK OUT, HASKELL!</i> <i>IT'S REAL!</i>



<i>AND HASKELL GETS</i> <i>THE TEAR GAS.</i>



<i>HE'S IN IT,</i>
<i>DON'T YOU SEE?</i>



LET'S GET OUT OF HERE,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!



<i>DURING THE, UH,</i>
<i>WHAT THE GOVERNMENT</i>



<i>LATER CALLED</i>
<i>A POLICE RIOT,</i>



<i>I WAS ACCUSED BY THE F.B.I.</i>
<i>OF STARTING DISTURBANCES</i> <i>AND RIOTS</i>



FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE FEATURE
FILM, 'CAUSE THE FILM WAS--



I WISHED I HAD
THAT POWER.



<i>...RUNNING IN ALL DIRECTIONS</i>



<i>AND PLENTY OF THINGS</i>
<i>ARE BEING THROWN.</i>



<i>THEN THE LAST SHOT,</i> <i>WHERE YOU SEE</i>



<i>THE CAMERAMAN'S CAR</i>
<i>BURNING</i>



<i>AND A LITTLE TOURIST CAR</i>
<i>GOES BY WITH A KID</i>



<i>WITH A FLASH CAMERA,</i>



<i>AND THEY TAKE A PICTURE.</i>



<i>RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE ENTIRE</i>
<i>NATION THIS IS HAPPENING.</i>



<i>THEN THE CAMERA PULLS BACK</i>



<i>AND PANS OVER TO ME</i>
<i>ON MY CAMERA.</i>



<i>...SEEING THESE PEOPLE BEING</i>
<i>DRAGGED INTO THE POLICE WAGON.</i>



<i>WHAT I WAS TRYING</i>
<i>TO SAY IS THAT</i>



<i>EVERYBODY IS</i>
<i>IN SOMEBODY'S MOVIE.</i>



<i>BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY,</i>
<i>THERE'S ANOTHER LEVEL</i>



<i>OF REALITY GOING ON.</i>



AND SO WHAT I WAS SAYING,
IN A SENSE, IS,



DON'T NECESSARILY
BELIEVE ME.



<i>CERTAINLY WHEN THE CAMERA'S</i>
<i>POINTING AT US,</i>



<i>I DON'T CARE HOW NORMAL</i>
<i>YOU TRY TO BE,</i>



<i>WE TRY TO PRESENT OURSELVES</i>
<i>IN A CERTAIN WAY.</i>



<i>DOES THAT MEAN</i>
<i>YOU'RE TRYING TO</i>



<i>PRESENT YOURSELF IN A CERTAIN WAY?



<i>I'M DEFINITELY TRYING TO
PRESENT MYSELF IN A CERTAIN WAY.



<i>IT'S PART OF</i>
<i>THE SOCIALIZING PROCESS.</i>



IT'S PART OF, UH--
PART OF LIFE.



<i>SO YOU'RE--</i>
<i>YOU'RE ACTING TOO?</i>



ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY.



<i>SO WHEN ARE PEOPLE</i>
<i>NOT ACTING?</i>



IT'S HARD FOR A PERSON
WHO ISN'T AN ACTOR BY PROFESSION,



YOU KNOW,
TO KEEP PERFORMING AS AN ACTOR.



AND, UH, THERE WILL BE
MOMENTS, MANY OF THEM,



WHERE HE WILL AUTOMATICALLY
PUT DOWN THAT ROLE



AND, UH--
AND JUST BE HIMSELF.



<i>ARE YOU GOING TO</i> <i>TALK TO CONRAD?</i>



<i>I'M INTERVIEWING HIM</i> <i>ON TUESDAY.</i>



TAKE THIS WITH.
I LIKE THE PICTURE.



<i>SO CAN YOU</i>
<i>TELL ME ANY-- ANY--</i>



<i>WHAT KINDS OF THINGS</i>
<i>SHOULD I ASK CONRAD?</i>



<i>ANY STORIES?</i>



ASK HIM ABOUT
THE WEXLER-HALL DAYS, I THINK.



<i>YOUR FATHER AND I</i>
<i>HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER</i>



<i>EVER SINCE, UH,</i>
<i>THE EARLY '50s.</i>



HASKELL AND I STARTED
A COMPANY IN 1976,



WHICH WE NAMED WEXLER-HALL



<i>TO BE ABLE TO EARN MONEY</i>
<i>MAKING COMMERCIALS.</i>



IT'S MILLER TIME.



<i>THE WAY I FIGURED</i> <i>IT OUT IS THAT</i>



<i>THE CORPORATIONS ARE</i>
<i>TAKING IT AWAY FROM YOU,</i> <i>YOU KNOW.</i>



<i>AND THIS IS A WAY OF</i>
<i>TAKING IT BACK FROM THEM.</i>



HASKELL IS THE FIGHTER BETWEEN
THE TWO OF US, AND I'M THE LOVER.



<i>I'M NOT CONFRONTATIONAL.</i>



<i>I'M SOMEBODY THAT</i>
<i>DOESN'T TAKE ARMS</i>



<i>AGAINST A SEA OF TROUBLE THAT WAY.</i>



I REMEMBER HASKELL WAS VERY
POLITICAL IN THOSE DAYS,



AND MY FATHER WASN'T
AND HAS NEVER BEEN VERY POLITICAL.



<i>YOU KNOW, I LOVE</i>
<i>THE IDEA OF THIS</i>



<i>KIND OF MARRIAGE</i>
<i>BETWEEN OUR DADS.</i>



I ALWAYS FELT FROM YOUR DAD
GROWING UP THIS WARMTH



AND THIS KINDNESS AND THIS HUMOR--



LIGHTNESS THAT MY DAD DIDN'T
REALLY HAVE OR DIDN'T SHOW ME.



<i>IT WAS ALWAYS SUCH
A RELIEF TO BE AROUND HIM</i>



<i>'CAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS SO--</i>



EVEN WEXLER-HALL, I'D COME IN
AND HE WAS SO WELCOMING



AND CHATTING AND--



YOU KNOW, JUST--
HE SAW THINGS AS, YOU KNOW,



THEY JUST KIND OF
FLEW OVER HIM,



AND MY DAD WAS, LIKE,
ALWAYS UP AGAINST SOMEBODY



AND, LIKE, FIGHTING--



<i>ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE</i>
<i>ALWAYS ADMIRED ABOUT HASKELL</i>



IS HE GETS UP
EVERY SINGLE MORNING



AND HE RANTS AGAINST
THE INJUSTICE IN THE WORLD.



<i>THE</i> VATICAN JOURNAL <i>SAID THAT</i>



<i>THE U.S. JUSTIFICATION</i>
<i>FOR THE WAR</i>



HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH WHAT THEY SAY IT IS.



IT HAS TO DO WITH ECONOMICS.
IT HAS TO DO WITH OIL.



<i>I ADMIRE THAT BECAUSE</i>



IT MEANS THAT YOU'RE
NOT COMPLACENT.



AND EVEN THOUGH AT 80 YEARS OLD
YOU'VE SEEN EVERYTHING



<i>AND YOU SEE IT OVER</i>
<i>AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN,</i>



<i>HE NEVER STOPS RANTING.</i>



<i>DAD, I WANT TO ASK ONE--
MAKE ONE SUGGESTION.</i>



<i>WHAT?</i>



<i>THE TWO OF US DON'T TALK
ANY POLITICS DURING THE TRIP.</i>



NO. IF YOU'RE MAKING
A DOCUMENTARY



WHERE I'M
THE MAIN CHARACTER,



YOU'D BETTER BE SURE
THAT I'M GONNA TALK POLITICS



BECAUSE, UM, AFTER ALL,



YOU KNOW, WE ARE GOING TO
AN ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATION,



<i>WHICH COULD INDEED</i>
<i>MAKE ME SUSPECT ABOUT</i>



WHAT THIS
DOCUMENTARY'S ABOUT.



AM I GONNA BE GOING
TO AN ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATION



TO BE MADE FUN OF?



<i>NO. YOU CAN TELL ME.</i>
<i>I JUST MAY NOT REACT, BECAUSE--</i>



NO, I DON'T WANT YOUR--
YOU DON'T HAVE TO REACT.



I MEAN,
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS,



YOU WANT TO BE
THE JOURNALIST.



I ASSUME THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING. THAT YOU WANT TO JUST, UM,



OBSERVE.



<i>I HAVEN'T BEEN</i>
<i>TO A PEACE DEMONSTRATION</i>



<i>WITH MY DAD SINCE 1967.</i>



<i>AT 10 YEARS OLD, I HARDLY
CONSIDERED MYSELF



<i>PART OF A PROTEST MOVEMENT.



<i>NONETHELESS,</i>
<i>MY FATHER INSISTED</i>



<i>THAT I BE THE ONE</i>
<i>TO CARRY THE SIGN.</i>



YOU WILL NOTICE THAT
WE USED MY CREDIT CARD



TO PAY FOR THIS GAS
AS MY CONTRIBUTION,



UH, TOWARDS THIS TRIP
TO SAN FRANCISCO.



HEY LOOK AT-- LOOK AT--



GET SOME WILD SHOTS
OF THE SOLDIERS, MARK.



MARK? <i>-I'VE BEEN GETTING IT.</i>
<i>I'VE BEEN GETTING IT.</i>



THEY'RE ALL GOING UP
TO THE PEACE MARCH.



<i>THERE'S YOUR SOLDIERS</i> <i>WHO ARE BEING</i>



<i>BROUGHT AROUND</i>
<i>FROM EVERYWHERE</i>



TO GET READY
TO GO TO WAR



TO, UH, DEFEND, UM--



DEFEND CHEVRON,
WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.



<i>I JUST KNOW IN
THE PAST IF WE'VE ENGAGED</i>



<i>IN POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS,</i>
<i>IT USUALLY ENDS IN</i>



<i>YOU TELLING ME I DON'T KNOW</i>
<i>ANYTHING ABOUT HISTORY,</i>



<i>AND THEN THAT'S IT.</i>



<i>SO I'D RATHER NOT</i>
<i>GET INTO IT.</i>



I WANT YOU,
AS A DOCUMENTARIAN,



EVEN THOUGH
YOU ARE MY SON,



TO REFLECT...



WHAT I BELIEVE
AND WHAT I SAY.



NOW, YOU CAN MAKE
YOUR COMMENTS ON 'EM,



BUT TO, UM--
TO GO IN AND BE THE PRIME ACTOR



IN YOUR--
IN YOUR FILM--



UH, TO SUPPLY
CERTAIN VISUAL FOOTAGE



WHICH YOU WILL THEN
ADJUST TO FIT YOUR VIEW--



IS SOMETHING I DON'T
WANT TO HAVE TO BE ON GUARD ABOUT.



<i>THERE IT IS--</i> <i>SAN FRANCISCO.</i>



NOW, WHERE DO I GO?
I'M FUCKED.



<i>NO, KEEP GOING.</i>



<i>The second exit</i> <i>on the right</i>



<i>and then right turn</i>
<i>onto U.S. 101 North.</i>



YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU AND ME
MARCHED AGAINST THE VIETNAM WAR--



AND I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE
TOLD YOU THIS BEFORE-- ALL OF US--



ALL OF US FELT THAT



AFTER MARCHING 50, 60 TIMES,
NOBODY'S LISTENING.



THEY'RE GONNA DO
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO ANYWAY.



<i>HE DID TELL ME,</i> <i>AND HE TOLD ME</i>



<i>OVER AND OVER AGAIN.</i>



<i>OUR BREAKFAST-TABLE CONVERSATION
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP



<i>WAS ALWAYS HIS CHANCE</i>
<i>TO RANT AGAINST THE CRIMES</i>



<i>OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.</i>



...ABOUT WHY WE SHOULD
GO TO WAR--



<i>MY MOM AND I WEREN'T</i>
<i>EXACTLY THE BEST AUDIENCE.</i>



<i>BUT THEN, HE DIDN'T</i>
<i>SEEM TO NOTICE.</i>



SO WE'LL SEE WHAT
THE DEMONSTRATION IS TODAY.



NOW, MARK, IF YOU CUT OUT
ALL THIS POLITICAL TALK



BECAUSE YOU DON'T AGREE
WITH ME, I'LL BE PISSED.



I WILL BE PISSED
FROM MY CAN OF DUST



WHICH WILL BE DUMPED
INTO THE OCEAN.



SO YOU CAN'T GET AWAY FROM ME.
IT'D BETTER BE IN,



WE NEED
A HIGH ANGLE.



<i>IT SAYS HERE,
"THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THESE EVENTS</i>



<i>ARE TELLING.</i>



<i>SHOWING UP THESE DAYS--</i>
<i>NOT JUST THE USUAL</i> <i>KOOKY CADRES</i>



<i>OF SEMI-PROFESSIONAL</i>
<i>PROTEST JUNKIES,</i>



<i>ANTI-GLOBALIZATION</i>
<i>CRUSADERS</i>



<i>AND WHACKED-OUT</i>
<i>CONSPIRACY THEORISTS,</i>



<i>BUT PROTESTERS FROM</i>
<i>THE SOLID MIDDLE CLASSES".</i>



WELL, I GUESS THAT'S US--
THE SOLID MIDDLE CLASS.



YOU'RE RONNIE GILBERT?



I RECOGNIZE RONNIE GILBERT
WITH THE WOMEN IN BLACK,



THE ANTI-WAR PEOPLE.



I LOVE YOU!



<i>AND, YOU KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN
TALKING TO ME ABOUT MUSIC



<i>FOR THE FILM, YOU KNOW?</i>



<i>YOU'VE GOT THE TAPE OF THE
WEAVERS, WHICH WE PUT IN THE CAR



<i>DRIVING DOWN HERE.</i>



<i>AND REMEMBER WHEN I HEARD</i>
<i>THAT BEAUTIFUL WOMAN'S VOICE</i>



<i>ON THE TAPE, I SAID,



"THAT'S RONNIE GILBERT.
THAT VOICE REALLY GETS TO YOU".



<i>AND THERE WAS THAT</i>
<i>VERY WOMAN RIGHT THERE.</i>



<i>♪ SOMETIMES I TAKE</i> <i>A GREAT NOTION ♪</i>



<i>♪ TO JUMP INTO THE RIVER</i>
<i>AND DROWN ♪</i>



<i>IT'S A COUPLE HOURS</i>
<i>AFTER THE DEMONSTRATION,</i>



<i>AND I'M BACK IN MY ROOM.</i>



AND MY DAD JUST CALLED ME ON THE
PHONE FROM HIS ROOM DOWN THE HALL



AND SAID HE HAD SOMETHING
VERY IMPORTANT TO TELL ME



AND TO BRING MY CAMERA.



IF YOU DON'T WANT TO
ACCEPT MY, UM--



MY SETUP...



THAT'S FINE,
BUT I DO THINK THAT, UM--



I DO THINK THAT SITTING HERE,
THE LIGHT WILL BE GOOD AT ME.



<i>WHAT ABOUT GETTING A LITTLE
OF THE LAST BIT OF LIGHT OUTSIDE?</i>



PARDON ME? <i>-HOW ABOUT IF WE GET A
LITTLE OF THE LAST LIGHT OUTSIDE?</i>



UH, WELL, THE LAST LIGHT'S GONNA
HAVE TO HIT A PART OF MY FACE, RIGHT?



<i>LET'S JUST GO SEE</i>
<i>WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE</i> <i>OUT THERE.</i>



- OUTSIDE?
- <i>YEAH.</i>



OUTSIDE? LOOK. WHAT I HAVE TO SAY
IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE IMAGE,



AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET
AS GOOD A SOUND OUTSIDE.



YOU'RE GONNA GET A LOT
OF BACKGROUND SOUND.



<i>CAN I JUST SEE</i>
<i>WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE OUTSIDE?</i>



OKAY, IF YOU WANT THE LIGHT ON
ME, I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT TO DO.



JUST MOVE THIS CHAIR FORWARD
AND I'LL GET A LINER ON ME.



<i>I JUST WANT TO SEE</i>
<i>YOU WITH THE CITY.</i> -HERE. LOOKIT.



<i>- I'D LIKE TO SEE THE CITY.</i>
- MARK. MARKO.



- <i>WHAT?</i>
- LOOK AT THIS.



<i>CAN WE JUST SEE</i>
<i>THE CITY?</i>



I'M ASKING 'CAUSE I WANT TO SAY
SOMETHING FOR YOUR FUCKING MOVIE.



AND THE LIGHT'S
NOT ON YOUR LENS.



IF YOU SIT THERE IT'D BE BETTER,
BECAUSE IT'D BE A NICE LINER.



AND IT'S COMING AROUND,
ABOUT TO HIT THE BACK OF MY HEAD.



- <i>DAD--</i>
- THE REASON I CALLED YOU OVER



IS BECAUSE I WANT TO
SAY SOMETHING.



<i>OKAY. COULD WE JUST</i>
<i>WALK OUTSIDE FOR A SECOND?</i>



<i>YOU COULD STILL SAY IT</i>
<i>WHEN WE COME BACK IN.</i>



<i>DAD, IT'S SO--</i>
<i>IT'S SO PRETTY OUT THERE.</i>



<i>JUST CAN I GET</i>
<i>ONE SHOT OUTSIDE?</i>



<i>LET ME ASK YOU THIS.</i>
<i>THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE.</i>



<i>YOU'RE TELLING ME</i>
<i>WHAT THE FILM'S ABOUT.</i>



<i>NO. NO. I'M TELLING YOU</i>
<i>THAT I'D LIKE--</i>



YOU'RE TELLING ME--



<i>I'D LIKE TO SHOOT THE
BACKGROUND I WANT TO SHOOT.



- <i>I'M BEHIND THE CAMERA.</i>
- WAIT A SECOND. WAIT A SECOND.



IS THIS CONTENT
OR IS THIS PICTURE?



I'M SAYING TO YOU,
<i>I</i> WANT TO TALK TO <i>YOUR</i> CAMERA.



I CALLED YOU UP IN
YOUR ROOM AND SAID,



"MARK, I WANT TO
SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS DAY".



NOW, IF YOU CAN'T
RESPECT THAT <i>IMMEDIATELY,</i>



THEN I TRULY--
I TRULY PUT YOUR, UM--



I TRULY PUT WHY WE'RE MAKING
THIS FILM INTO QUESTION.



<i>DAD, I CAME</i>
<i>RIGHT OVER, DIDN'T I?</i>



<i>I JUST WANT TO GET THE SUN</i>
<i>SETTING WITH YOU OUTSIDE.</i>



BULLSHIT WITH THE SUNSET!



ISN'T THAT A FUCKING
MILLER BEER COMMERCIAL?



IT'S YOUR FATHER TALKING ABOUT
SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO HIM.



YOU WANT TO TAKE THE SUNSET?



TAKE YOUR FUCKING
CAMERA, TAKE A PICTURE OF IT



AND THEN CUT IT
IN YOUR MOVIE.



<i>BUT I GET A LOT</i>
<i>OF YOU SITTING DOWN</i> <i>IN A ROOM.</i>



<i>THIS WOULD BE YOU STANDING UP
AND--</i> -WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE



IS THAT I, THE STAR
OF YOUR FUCKING MOVIE,



DESPERATELY WANT
TO SAY SOMETHING



ABOUT WHAT TODAY
HAS MEANT TO ME



AND WHY I WENT UP HERE
TO SAN FRANCISCO WITH YOU



TO THIS PEACE MARCH.



OKAY? NOW, IF THAT'S
NOT IMPORTANT TO YOU



OR IF THAT'S IN BALANCE
IMPORTANT TO YOU



WITH THE SHOT
OF THE FUCKING SUNSET,



THEN I MIGHT AS WELL
HANG UP MY JOCK STRAP, YOU KNOW?



<i>EVER SINCE GETTING BACK</i>
<i>FROM THE PEACE MARCH,</i>



<i>MY DAD'S BEEN A BIT MORE RELUCTANT
TO BRING UP PERSONAL THINGS.



<i>MAYBE OUR ARGUMENT</i>
<i>IN SAN FRANCISCO</i> <i>IS TO BLAME,</i>



<i>OR MAYBE HE FEELS THAT</i>
<i>BY MAKING THIS DOCUMENTARY,</i>



<i>I'M TRESPASSING</i>
<i>ON HIS TERRITORY.</i>



<i>AFTER ALL,</i>
<i>FOR THE LONGEST TIME,</i>



<i>THERE WAS ROOM FOR ONLY
ONE FILMMAKER IN OUR FAMILY.



<i>HE'S AGREED TO BE INTERVIEWED</i>
<i>FOR A BIOGRAPHY</i> <i>ON STEVE McQUEEN,</i>



<i>BUT HE'S POSTPONED A NUMBER</i>
<i>OF ONE-ON-ONES WITH ME.</i>



<i>I HOPE I HAVEN'T</i>
<i>CAUSED HIM TO CLAM UP.</i>



<i>ANY PSYCHOLOGIST</i> <i>WILL TELL YOU</i>



<i>THAT THE STRONGER</i>
<i>OF THE TWO INSTINCTS</i> <i>TO DISCLOSE</i>



<i>OR TO KEEP A SECRET,</i>



<i>THE INSTINCT TO DISCLOSE--</i>
<i>THAT'S THE STRONGER ONE.</i>



<i>PEOPLE WOULD</i>
<i>MUCH RATHER OPEN UP.</i>



<i>THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES</i>
<i>IN GETTING CLOSE</i> <i>TO YOUR FATHER</i>



<i>THAT YOU MAY NOT</i>
<i>HAVE THOUGHT OF</i>



THAT YOU SHOULD
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF.



"PERSONAL RELEASE.



<i>TELL THEM WHO YOU ARE".</i>



WHO IS THIS? -<i>IT'S A
RELEASE FORM FOR YOU TO SIGN.</i>



<i>I DON'T THINK</i> <i>I'M GONNA SIGN THIS.</i>



<i>I CAN'T MAKE</i>
<i>THE MOVIE WITHOUT IT.</i>



YEAH, BUT I'M THE SUBJECT
OF THIS GODDAMN THING.



<i>I KNOW. THE SUBJECT IS THE MAIN
PERSON WHO'S GOT TO SIGN IT.



I'M NOT GONNA SIGN
TILL I SEE THE MOVIE.



<i>YOU CAN'T DO THAT.</i>
<i>I WON'T ALLOW IT. BUT--</i>



I WON'T!
WHAT IF YOU MAKE A--



WHAT IF YOU MAKE A FILM
THAT'S-- THAT I FIND INSULTING?



<i>YOU GOTTA</i>
<i>TRUST ME.</i>



NO, I'M SORRY.



- BUT, UH--
- HERE. HERE. JUST SIGN.



RIGHT THERE.



<i>YOUR ASSOCIATION</i> <i>WITH YOUR FATHER</i>



<i>IS ONE OF AN IMAGE</i>
<i>FROM CHILDHOOD UP</i>



OF WHO YOUR FATHER--
HE'S YOUR <i>FATHER.</i>



HE'S NOT A PERSON.



<i>HE PROBABLY KNOWS IT ALL AND--</i>



<i>I MEAN, YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT A CHILD GROWING UP.</i>



YOU BRING TO FATHERHOOD
WHO YOU ARE.



IF YOU'RE COMPLEX,



THERE'LL BE SOME COMPLEXITY
IN YOUR "FATHERHOOD-NESS".



<i>YOU WILL BE VERY COMPASSIONATE</i>
<i>WITH YOUR CHILDREN.</i>



<i>YOU'LL BE TOO STRICT</i>
<i>SOMETIMES</i>



<i>AND NOT STRICT ENOUGH</i>
<i>AT OTHER TIMES.</i>



IT'S A DIMENSIONAL THING.



WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY OURSELVES.



I THINK THAT'S THE
REAL PURPOSE OF EGO.



<i>BECAUSE IF I CANNOT</i>
<i>IDENTIFY MYSELF,</i>



<i>IN MY OWN TERMS,</i>



<i>THEN I'M FORCED TO ACCEPT</i>
<i>YOUR IDENTIFYING ME.</i>



<i>DAD, I HAVE SOMETHING--</i>
<i>SOME NEWS TO TELL YOU.</i>



<i>YOU KNOW HOW I DID</i> AIR FORCE
ONE <i>FOR</i> <i>NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC</i>



- <i>FOR TELEVISION?</i>
- YES.



<i>THE WHITE HOUSE HAS JUST APPROVED
ME TO FLY WITH PRESIDENT BUSH



<i>FOR</i> SMITHSONIAN <i>MAGAZINE TO DO
A STILL STORY OF</i> AIR FORCE ONE.



OH, HOW GREAT. <i>-SO I'M GONNA BE
FLYING WITH OUR PRESIDENT.</i>



OH, GREAT.



SO WHEN THE TERRORISTS START
BOMBING THINGS AND SO FORTH,



AT LEAST YOU'LL BE PROBABLY
THE SAFEST PLACE IN THE WORLD,



BECAUSE YOU CAN BE SURE
THAT THEY'RE GONNA, UH,



MAKE SURE THAT OUR, UM,
UNELECTED PRESIDENT IS SAFE, SO--



<i>ALTHOUGH I NEVER INTENDED TO
FOLLOW IN MY FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS,</i>



<i>I TOO PICKED UP A CAMERA</i>
<i>AT AN EARLY AGE.</i>



<i>IT ALLOWED ME TO SEE THE WORLD



<i>BUT BE SHIELDED FROM IT
THROUGH THE LENS.



<i>TO GET OUT OF WRITING
RESEARCH PAPERS IN HIGH SCHOOL,



<i>I WOULD OFTEN
CONVINCE MY TEACHERS



<i>TO ALLOW ME TO HAND IN
PHOTO ASSIGNMENTS.



<i>I EVENTUALLY BECAME</i>
<i>A PHOTOJOURNALIST,</i>



<i>AND EVEN THOUGH MY FATHER
AND I USED CAMERAS FOR A LIVING,



<i>I STILL THOUGHT OF OUR
PROFESSIONS AS DIFFERENT ENOUGH.



<i>MY FATHER ALWAYS PRESENTED
HIMSELF AS THE ULTIMATE AUTHORITY.



<i>BUT WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT</i>
<i>THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT</i>



<i>WAS ACTUALLY MIGHTIER</i>
<i>THAN HASKELL WEXLER,</i> <i>I EMBRACED IT.</i>



<i>IT'S HARD TO SAY WHETHER</i>
<i>I INITIALLY DID THIS</i>



<i>TO SEPARATE MYSELF FROM HIM</i>



<i>OR BECAUSE I REALLY FAVORED</i>
<i>THE OPPOSING SIDE.</i>



<i>WHEN I KNEW YOU, YOU WERE
A TEENAGER IN HIGH SCHOOL,</i>



<i>AND YOU WERE RIDING
AROUND IN COP CARS



<i>WITH GREAT RESPECT FOR THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE F.B.I.,



ALL OF YOUR FATHER'S
ENEMIES.



<i>I THINK YOU THOUGHT I WAS
SPYING ON YOU FOR THE F.B.I.</i>



YOU PROBABLY WOULD'VE
IF THEY'D OFFERED YOU THE JOB.



THIS, TO HIM,
WAS TERRIBLY PAINFUL--



THAT NOT ONLY
WERE YOU, UH,



ADOPTING A POLITICAL POSITION
QUITE CONTRARY TO HIS,



BUT THAT HE WASN'T ABLE



TO COMMUNICATE HIS
OWN VALUES TO YOU.



<i>HE WAS ALWAYS ASKING ME,</i>



<i>"CAN YOU THINK OF
SOMETHING TO CONVINCE MARK?"</i>



<i>AND I SAID TO HIM, "LOOK, THIS
IS NOT AN INTELLECTUAL PROBLEM.



<i>MARK HAS HIS OWN IDEAS,</i>
<i>AND I DON'T THINK</i> <i>ANYTHING I SAY</i>



<i>OR ANY DOCUMENT I SHOW HIM</i>
<i>IS GOING TO SWAY HIM".</i>



<i>SO, DAD,</i>
<i>WHERE ARE WE HERE?</i>



MARK, I WANTED
TO TELL YOU THAT WE'RE GOING IN



TO DO A LITTLE
PHOTO SHOW--



PART OF A DOCUMENTARY--
AT STANLEY SCHEINBAUM'S HOUSE.



<i>BUT, DAD,</i>
<i>THIS IS A MEETING</i>



<i>THAT IS</i> AGAINST <i>THINGS</i>
<i>THAT THE GOVERNMENT</i> <i>IS TRYING TO DO</i>



<i>VIS-A-VIS CUBA.</i>



<i>I HAVE TO BE CLEARED AGAIN</i>
<i>TO GO OFF WITH PRESIDENT BUSH</i>



<i>ON THE AIRPLANE,</i>



<i>AND IF THERE'S A PROBLEM,</i>
<i>IT COULD BE BECAUSE OF THIS.</i>



<i>I DON'T WANT</i>
<i>TO BE LINKED.</i>



- WAIT, WAIT.
- <i>I DON'T WANT</i> <i>TO BE LINKED.</i>



IN OTHER WORDS, YOU DON'T WANT TO
TAKE YOUR CAMERA INTO ANY PLACE



WHICH YOU THINK THAT IF GEORGE
W. BUSH SAW YOU DO THAT,



HE WOULD NOT
GIVE YOU CLEARANCE.



AND I'M SAYING,
THAT IS PERVERSION.



<i>THAT IS</i>
<i>ADOLF HITLER TALK.</i>



<i>I'M JUST SAYING,</i>



<i>I'D LIKE TO</i>
<i>PLAY IT SAFE.</i>



<i>I-I DON'T WANT TO BRING SAUL
INTO THIS. I-I REALLY DON'T.



I DO. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.
SHOOT THE SCENE!



YOU GOT A SCENE
INSTEAD OF A TALKING HEAD.



WELL, I THINK IT'S PROBABLY
SAFER FOR YOU NOT TO GO IN, MARK.



<i>SO YOU THINK MY CONCERNS
ARE LEGITIMATE?</i>



<i>TOTALLY. I THINK</i>
<i>YOU'RE VERY PERCEPTIVE</i>



IN THAT WE ARE
IN A PLACE NOW WHERE



SECURITY CONCERNS
HAVE BECOME DOMINANT.



AND THEY'VE CERTAINLY--
HOW SHOULD I SAY IT?



--TAKEN THE--
THE HIGH ROAD,



UH, OVER, LET'S SAY,
WHAT WE USED TO THINK OF



AS TRADITIONAL RIGHTS
AND LIBERTIES.



I TURNED THIS OFF.



- <i>TURN THAT BACK ON.</i>
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?



<i>SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO?</i> -LOOKIT.
IT'S NOT "WHAT SHOULD WE DO?"



I KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO.
I'M GOING IN THERE



AND FIND OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON.



MAYBE LEARN SOMETHING
AND USE MY CAMERA TO, UH--



IF I LEARN SOMETHING, OTHER
PEOPLE CAN LOOK WHAT I'VE SHOT,



AND THEN THEY'LL
LEARN SOMETHING.



THAT'S WHAT AMERICA'S
ALL ABOUT.



NOW, WHAT NAZI GERMANY
WAS ALL ABOUT,



I CAN'T TELL YOU.



I THOUGHT I GAVE HIM
PRETTY GOOD ADVICE.



<i>HIS WHOLE FIGHT IN LIFE</i>



<i>IS TO SAY HE'S MORE IMPORTANT</i>



<i>THAN ME, UNDERSTAND?</i>
- <i>UH-HUH.</i>



<i>THIS IS THE BACK LOT.</i>



<i>AND-AND-AND</i>
<i>TO BE ABLE TO SAY</i>



<i>THAT THE CAPTAIN OF AIR FORCE
ONE CALLS HIM UP, SAYING,</i>



<i>"COME ON, FLY ON AIR FORCE ONE
AGAIN WITH BUSH" AND SO FORTH.



<i>BECAUSE HE NEEDS-- HE NEEDS TO SAY
HE'S AS IMPORTANT AS ME. MORE SO.



<i>AND WITH</i>
<i>THE OFFICIAL STAMP.</i>



<i>A FEW MORE TIMES.</i>



<i>SO HOW'S HE DOING FOR 80?</i>



HOW'S HE DOING FOR 80?
HE'S DOING GREAT FOR <i>60.</i>



FOR 80, HE'S DOING SUPER!



GOOD JOB. THE WHOLE SCIENCE IS,



MAKE 20 OUT OF TEN,
RIGHT?



IT'S LIKE MY DAD SAID--



I SHOULD BE A CHEMIST,



'CAUSE I COULD TAKE GOOD MONEY
AND CHANGE IT INTO SHIT.



HOW MANY ROUNDS WE DOING?



WE'RE DOING FIVE ROUNDS,
THREE MINUTES EACH. -FIVE?



YES!
SURPRISED?



<i>SO, COME ON!</i>
<i>TOO MUCH TALK,</i> <i>MOVIE STAR? COME ON!</i>



GOOD JOB, MISTER.
WHO YOU KILL TODAY?



WHO WAS YOUR
IMAGINARY OPPONENT?



AH, I WAS NOT KILLING.



I WAS IN SPORTS. SPORTS.



I WAS DEFEATING
A VERY NICE GUY



WHO, UH, HAD TO KNOW
THAT I WAS A BETTER BOXER.



HASKELL, THERE IS
NO "NICE GUY" IN BOXING.



<i>WELL, THIS IS ONE</i> <i>OF VICTOR'S SONS.</i>



<i>HE WAS</i>
<i>A CHESS CHAMPION.</i>



NOW, THIS KID'S
NOT ONLY



INTELLECTUALLY ACTIVE,



BUT HE INSISTS THEY DO
WHAT HE HAS IN MIND



AS FAR AS THEIR-THEIR--
THEIR BODIES,



SO THEY'RE GOOD
IN SPORTS AS WELL.



MAYBE I WOULD HAVE
BEEN A BETTER FATHER



IF I KNEW WHAT I KNOW NOW
WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP,



SO YOU WOULDN'T
TURN OUT TO BE SUCH A MESS.



YEAH, I'M-I'M ROLLING.
OKAY.



<i>I GUESS
IT WAS ONLY FAIR</i>



<i>THAT MY FATHER ASK ME
SOME QUESTIONS.</i>



- ALL RIGHT.
- <i>I WAS REALLY CURIOUS</i>



<i>TO FIND OUT WHAT HE WANTED TO
LEARN ABOUT HIS MESSED-UP SON.



YOU'RE TALKING TO PEOPLE.
I DON'T KNOW--



I DON'T KNOW ALL THE PEOPLE
YOU'RE TALKING TO.



UH, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE ASKING, AND WHAT'S MORE,



I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.



NOW, I ASSUME THAT MOST OF THEM
ARE SAYING GOOD THINGS ABOUT ME.



A GUY COMES THERE
AND HE'S MY SON.



<i>SO, UH, THEY'RE</i>
<i>NOT GONNA, UH--</i>



<i>IN OTHER WORDS, THEY'RE</i>
<i>NOT GONNA DO THE INTERVIEW</i>



<i>IF THEY WANT TO SAY THAT</i>



HASKELL'S A 14-CARAT PRICK
AND, UH,



WHY ARE YOU MAKING
A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT HIM?



SO THEN,
HOW MUCH OF WHAT--



OF WHAT YOU HEAR
FROM PEOPLE SAY



<i>DO YOU FEEL IS</i>
<i>WHO I AM?</i>



THIS HAS BEEN INTERESTING,
BECAUSE A LOT OF THINGS



I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT YOU
OVER THE YEARS, IT'S BEEN--



<i>SOME PEOPLE SAY, YOU KNOW--</i>
<i>A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE--</i>



<i>YOU KNOW, MOST PEOPLE HAVE
GREAT RESPECT FOR YOU AND LOVE,



<i>BUT SOME PEOPLE SAY</i>
<i>YOU'RE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT</i>



<i>AND, UH,</i>
<i>EXTREMELY OPINIONATED.</i>



GROWING UP, UM,



I OFTEN FELT



THAT YOU UNDERMINED ME
IN CERTAIN WAYS.



I REMEMBER WHEN
I HAD CERTAIN, UH--



IF I WERE EXPRESSING
EMOTION OFTEN,



YOU'D SAY,
"OH, YOU'RE JUST ACTING".



<i>AND, UM--



OR "YOU'RE STUPID, MARK".



I REMEMBER HEARING THAT
A LOT WHEN GROWING UP.



<i>THEN I REMEMBER,</i>
<i>YOU KNOW,</i>



GROWING UP AND,
AROUND THE DINNER TABLE,



YOU'D SIT AROUND AND SAY,
"OH, THAT DIRECTOR'S STUPID,



DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING".



YOU KNOW WHY
THAT WAS, MARK? <i>-WHY?</i>



BECAUSE MOSTLY THEY WERE.



MOSTLY THEY WERE...?



STUPID.



<i>SORRY I'M LATE, DAD.</i>



<i>WELL, IT'S EARLY</i> <i>IN THE MORNING,</i>



AND I HAVE SORT OF A TENSE
SITUATION FOR ME PERSONALLY,



BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IN A MONTH
AND A HALF I'M GONNA BE 81.



I DON'T FEEL 81.
I'VE NOT BEEN WORKING.



AND I HAVE AN INTERVIEW
WITH, UM, A DIRECTOR



WHO USED TO BE A CAMERAMAN
NAMED BILLE AUGUST.



LISTEN, I GOTTA DO STUFF
TO GET READY, SO, UH--



<i>I JUST WONDER WHAT</i>
<i>HE'S GONNA THINK ABOUT ME,</i>



ABOUT HIRING ME OR NOT.



I FEEL LIKE SAYING TO HIM,
"LOOKIT, BILLE,



YOU KNOW I CAN SHOOT.



YOU CAN TELL THAT
I'M HEALTHY AND ALERT.



YOU'RE GONNA GET ME
AT A BARGAIN PRICE



BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I
WAS TOLD THE BUDGET WAS.



SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? WHAT
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW FROM ME?"



BUT I WON'T SAY THAT.



WHAT I WILL SAY IS, UH,



"VERY PLEASED
TO MEET YOU.



I KNOW YOUR WORK,
AND, UH,



I'M GLAD THAT I HAVE
THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU,



AND I WOULD LIKE
TO KNOW WHAT--"



I WON'T USE THIS TERM,



BUT WHAT CAMERAMEN SAY,
"WHAT YOUR <i>VISION</i> IS".



I AM YOUR
OBEDIENT SERVANT.



<i>I NEVER KNEW MY FATHER</i>
<i>TO BE ANYONE'S SERVANT.</i>



<i>AND NO ONE KNOWS THAT BETTER</i>
<i>THAN THE PRODUCER OF</i>



ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST,



<i>MICHAEL DOUGLAS.</i> -<i>CUCKOO'S NEST</i>
WAS THE WORST EXPERIENCE



OF MY ENTIRE CAREER
THAT DAY.



<i>I THINK IT WAS</i>
<i>MICHAEL DOUGLAS WHO SUGGESTED</i>



<i>THAT I TALK TO HASKELL, AND
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED, BECAUSE I--



YOU KNOW, I THINK
HASKELL IS A BRILLIANT,



BRILLIANT CINEMATOGRAPHER.



<i>THE ONLY RESERVATION WAS
THAT HE HAD DIRECTED BEFORE,</i>



<i>AND IT WAS THAT-- THAT SLIGHT
RESERVATION OF A CINEMATOGRAPHER



WHO, YOU KNOW,
MIGHT WANT TO DIRECT,



AND WOULD HE TAKE OVER?



<i>MILOS FORMAN,</i>
<i>OUR DIRECTOR,</i>



<i>CAME FROM AN EASTERN KIND OF</i>
<i>EUROPEAN DISCIPLINE,</i>



<i>A SORT OF</i>
<i>AUTHORITARIAN FIGURE,</i>



AND DID NOT ENJOY
BEING QUESTIONED,



YOU KNOW,
AND HASKELL CERTAINLY



LIKED TO QUESTION
AUTHORITY.



WELL, OUR RELATIONS
STARTED TO DETERIORATE WHEN--



<i>WHEN I FOUND OUT</i>
<i>THAT HE'S SHARING</i> <i>HIS FRUSTRATION</i>



<i>WITH ACTORS,</i>



<i>AND THAT, OF COURSE,</i>
<i>MADE THE ACTORS NERVOUS.</i>



<i>THAT MADE</i>
<i>THE PRODUCERS NERVOUS.</i>



<i>AND FINALLY,</i>
<i>IT MADE ME NERVOUS,</i> <i>YOU KNOW.</i>



<i>YOUR DAD'S TOUGH.</i>
<i>I'LL NEVER FORGET HIS,</i>



YOU KNOW, KIND OF CRITICAL,
KIND OF JUDGING LOOK.



KIND OF NEUTRAL.
YOU COULDN'T QUITE TELL.



IT ALWAYS REMINDED ME
OF MY DAD,



AND MY DAD HAD A VERY
KIND OF A NEUTRAL--



JUST LIKE HE WAS LOOKING
AT YOU, ANALYZING YOU,



MAKING YOU FEEL LIKE,
"JEEZ, I DON'T KNOW".



I HEAR ACTORS, YOU KNOW,



COMING AND TELLING ME,
"SO WHAT'S HAPPENING AGAIN?



<i>HASKELL IS TELLING ME, 'MY GOD,
WHAT IS HE DOING?'" YOU KNOW?



<i>TELLING ACTORS THAT, YOU KNOW,</i>



<i>NOBODY WILL BE ABLE
TO PUT THIS THING TOGETHER.</i>



<i>I WILL CERTAINLY NOT BE ABLE</i>
<i>TO TIME IT UP PERFECTLY,</i>



<i>AND THINGS LIKE THAT.</i>



<i>WHICH I'LL TELL YOU,</i>
<i>YOU KNOW, IT'S SORT OF SILLY,</i>



<i>BECAUSE WHY DOES HE COMPLAIN</i>
<i>TO PEOPLE WHO-- WHO</i> I <i>HIRED?</i>



WHO ARE LOYAL TO ME
BECAUSE I HIRED THEM?



OF COURSE THEY WILL
COME AND TELL ME.



TO THIS DAY, BECAUSE
IT WAS MY FIRST MOVIE,



IT WAS THE HARDEST THING
I'D EVER DONE IN MY LIFE.



<i>BECAUSE HE WAS OLD ENOUGH</i>
<i>TO BE MY DAD,</i>



<i>AND HE WAS</i>
<i>AN ACADEMY-AWARD WINNER,</i>



AND JUST DIDN'T...
WORK OUT.



<i>I REPLACED HASKELL
WEXLER ON</i> CUCKOO'S NEST.



NOBODY SAID ANYTHING TO ME
ABOUT WHY HE WAS LET GO.



<i>I KNOW WHY.</i>



<i>AS I WATCHED</i>
<i>HASKELL'S FOOTAGE</i>



<i>AS HE WENT ON</i>
<i>INTO THE PICTURE,</i>



<i>I COULD SEE IT</i>
<i>DETERIORATE</i>



<i>AND BE LESS SHARP</i>
<i>AND LESS INSPIRED.</i>



<i>AND I'VE BEEN THERE,</i>
<i>SO I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.</i>



<i>AND IT'S SIMPLY A CASE WHERE
YOU ARE TRYING VERY, VERY HARD



<i>TO PLEASE THE DIRECTOR,</i>



<i>AND YOU DON'T KNOW</i>
<i>WHAT HE WANTS.</i>



<i>IT WAS ONE OF
THE FEW TIMES IN MY LIFE</i>



<i>THAT I WAS...</i>
<i>TRULY DEVASTATED.</i>



<i>I WAS SAYING I FELT</i>
<i>LIKE COMMITTING SUICIDE.</i>



<i>I FELT</i> HORRIBLE.



<i>TO THIS DAY,</i>
<i>I DON'T KNOW</i>



EXACTLY WHY I WAS FIRED.



UM, HOWEVER,



I HAD-- AND I HAVE--
SERIOUS CLUES.



<i>ABOUT SIX MONTHS BEFORE</i>
<i>WE FILMED</i> CUCKOO'S NEST,



<i>MY FRIEND DE ANTONIO</i>
<i>SAID THAT</i>



HE HAD CONTACT WITH
FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE



<i>KNOWN AS</i>
<i>THE WEATHER UNDERGROUND,</i>



<i>AND WOULD I BE INTERESTED</i>
<i>IN SHOOTING THE FILM?</i>



<i>AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW
IF PEOPLE GO AROUND</i>



<i>AFRAID THAT A COP</i>
<i>OR SOME F.B.I. MAN</i>



<i>OR SOME C.I.A. MAN</i>
<i>IS GONNA-- IS GONNA GRAB 'EM.</i>



<i>I JUST WANT TO KNOW</i>
<i>IF YOU WALK AROUND</i> <i>WITH THAT FEAR.</i>



<i>THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE,</i>
<i>I COULDN'T SHOW ANY PEOPLE,</i>



<i>I COULDN'T SHOW ANY FACES,</i>
<i>I CAN'T EVEN SHOW</i> <i>HEADS OF HAIR.</i>



<i>SO I WAS OBLIGED</i>
<i>MOSTLY TO, UH,</i>



<i>USE SOME</i>
<i>CHEESECLOTH MATERIAL</i>



<i>THAT YOUR MOTHER</i>
<i>GAVE ME,</i>



<i>AND, UH,</i>
<i>THERE WAS A MIRROR</i>



<i>ON THE WALL.</i>



<i>AND SO I BASICALLY SHOT--</i>
<i>THE ONLY THING I COULD SHOOT</i>



<i>WAS MYSELF AND DE ANTONIO</i>
<i>IN THE MIRROR.</i>



<i>AFTER</i> CUCKOO'S NEST
<i>HAD WRAPPED,</i>



<i>THE ACCOUNTANT</i>
<i>ON THE FILM</i>



SAID THAT THE F.B.I.
WAS UP IN OREGON,



AND THEY WERE QUESTIONING,
UH, SOME OF THE MAIDS,



AND THEY CAME IN
AND QUESTIONED HIM ABOUT ME.



NEVER. I NEVER HEARD
ABOUT F.B.I. COMING ON THE SET.



CERTAINLY DIDN'T
TALK TO ME.



AND NOBODY TOLD ME
THAT THEY WERE THERE.



I, UH, HAVE NO IDEA.



THE GOVERNMENT COULD HAVE
MADE TROUBLE FOR MILOS,



AND MY GUESS IS, THEY, UH--
THEY PUT THE HEAT ON MILOS



TO, UM-- UH--
TO GET RID OF ME.



<i>NO. OF ALL THE PEOPLE
TO TELL THAT TO,</i>



<i>I'D BE THE ONE, BECAUSE I'VE
ALWAYS BEEN VERY SYMPATHETIC



<i>TO HIS POLITICS.</i>



WHY WOULD HE NOT
HAVE TOLD ME



ABOUT THE F.B.I.?



BECAUSE HE LOVED TO BE THE
VICTIM. ESPECIALLY THE VICTIM



OF THE F.B.I.,
BECAUSE WE ALL HATED THE F.B.I.



THE F.B.I. IS
A JERKY ORGANIZATION.



<i>IT HAPPENED AGAIN</i>
<i>ON</i> THE CONVERSATION



<i>WHERE HASKELL DID NOT</i>
<i>GET ALONG WITH THE DIRECTOR,</i>



<i>AND SO THE DIRECTOR ASKED ME</i>
<i>TO COME IN AND SHOOT</i> <i>FOR HIM THEN.</i>



<i>AND HASKELL KNOWS THE AGENT</i>
<i>THAT I HAD AT THE TIME,</i>



<i>WHO WAS CRAYTON SMITH,</i>



AND HE CALLED CRAYTON UP ONE
DAY-- WELL, IT'S NOT HIS AGENT--



BUT HE CALLED CRAYTON
UP ONE DAY, AND HE SAYS,



"HEY, CRAYTON. GET BUTLER READY.
I'VE GOT ANOTHER PICTURE".



<i>SOMEONE LIKE YOUR DAD
IS ALSO A DIRECTOR--</i>



<i>IF DIRECTORS</i>
<i>LIKE YOUR DAD--</i>



<i>AND I'M TALKING ABOUT</i>
<i>SERIOUS HEAVYWEIGHTS--</i>



<i>SNIFF THAT THE GUY THAT</i>
<i>THEY'RE WORKING FOR</i>



IS LESS COMPETENT THAN THEMSELVES--



AND THIS MAY BE
A SUBCONSCIOUS THING--



THAT'S WHEN THEY START
TO BECOME DIFFICULT.



IT'S NOT LIKE HASKELL,
YOU KNOW, DOES A PALACE COUP



<i>AND STARTS SAYING, "NO, WE'RE NOT
GONNA SHOOT THIS SCENE TODAY.



<i>WE'RE GONNA SHOOT THIS ONE</i>
<i>INSTEAD" OR ANYTHING.</i>



<i>HE'S JUST VERY FORCEFUL</i>
<i>ABOUT HIS OPINIONS.</i>



<i>I PRAISE HIM FOR THAT FILM.</i>



<i>I REALLY DIDN'T GET ALONG WITH HIM
AND DIDN'T LIKE HIM PERSONALLY,



<i>AND HE'S THE ONLY CAMERAMAN
I'VE EVER BEEN ON BAD TERMS WITH.



I WOULD NEVER USE HIM AGAIN, BUT
HE WAS A DAMN GOOD CAMERAMAN.



HE'S A PAIN IN THE ASS
TO WORK WITH, HASKELL.



<i>YEAH. IT'S HIS ATTEMPT,</i>
<i>I THINK,</i>



<i>TO CONTROL THE STORY.</i>



<i>I JUST THINK THERE WAS
A PERIOD IN HASKELL'S LIFE</i>



<i>WHERE THE FRUSTRATION</i>
<i>AS A DIRECTOR WAS IMMENSE</i>



<i>AND WOULD HAVE PROBABLY</i>
<i>BEEN BETTER SERVED</i>



<i>BY GOING BACK TO THOSE



DOCUMENTARIES OR
WHATEVER IT WAS AT THAT POINT.



AS A DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY,
I ALWAYS HAVE WORKED



AS IF IT'S <i>MY</i> FILM.



<i>YOU'D ALMOST IN A SENSE</i>
<i>RATHER BE DIRECTING THE MOVIE.</i>



<i>OR WOULD YOU NOT?</i>



<i>I DON'T THINK THERE'S</i>
<i>A MOVIE THAT I'VE BEEN ON</i>



<i>THAT I WASN'T</i> SURE
<i>I COULD DIRECT IT BETTER.</i>



<i>BUT CERTAINLY ALSO,</i>



AS A DIRECTOR
OF PHOTOGRAPHY,



I HAVE TO SERVE
THE MOVIE



IN WHATEVER WAY I CAN



<i>AS A-- AS A</i>
<i>FILMMAKER.</i>



<i>YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE
COLOR BLIND. IS THAT TRUE?</i>



<i>I DON'T KNOW THE LEVEL
OF MY COLORBLINDNESS.</i>



<i>WHAT DO YOU SEE?</i>



OKAY,
THIS SAYS "12".



THIS IS NO PROBLEM
AT ALL.



OH, AND IT SAYS ON THE BACK,
"EVERYONE SEES 12".



<i>AND THE NEXT ONE?</i>



<i>WHAT DO YOU SEE?</i>



I CAN'T-- I CAN'T
REALLY SEE THIS ONE.



NO, I C-- I CANNOT S--



<i>THAT'S EIGHT.</i>



OOH, THIS IS A BITCH.



I'LL SHOW IT TO THE AUDIENCE.
I'M NOT LOOKING AT THE BACK.



YOU DEFINITELY SEE
A NUMBER HERE.



I CAN'T SEE ANY NUMBER
HERE AT ALL.



<i>THAT'S 16.</i>



<i>WELL--</i>



<i>IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE WHAT
MIGHT BE CALLED COLORBLINDNESS,



<i>BECAUSE I HAVE AN ACUTE</i>
<i>SENSIBILITY FOR DENSITY,</i>



<i>FOR, UH, DIFFERENCES</i>
<i>IN-IN GRAY AND WHITE.</i>



AND I THINK, ACTUALLY, MY LACK
OF TOTAL COLOR SENSITIVITY



<i>IS A POSITIVE FACTOR</i>
<i>RATHER THAN A NEGATIVE FACTOR,</i>



<i>ALTHOUGH CERTAINLY</i>
<i>DURING MY LIFE</i> <i>AS A CAMERAMAN,</i>



<i>I DID NOT WANT IT</i>
<i>PUBLICIZED.</i>



IN TERMS
OF MAKING FILMS



AND HOW HEAVY A HAND YOU USE
AND HOW DIRECT YOU ARE



IN TERMS OF
PUTTING FORTH YOUR AGENDA



IS-- I THINK, PROBABLY BEEN
AN ISSUE ON SOME OF HIS FILMS.



I THINK IN <i>MEDIUM COOL</i>
IT WAS ACTUALLY A GREAT ASSET,



AND IT'S A VERY INTERESTING
FILM AND A DOCUMENT OF THE TIMES.



AND THE OTHER FILMS,
I THINK, YOU KNOW,



IT MAY HAVE GOTTEN
IN THE WAY OF THE STORYTELLING.



<i>WELL, HE GAVE ME</i> <i>A SCRIPT ONE TIME</i>



<i>TO BE SHOT</i>
<i>IN LATIN AMERICA.</i>



<i>TOLD HIM I DIDN'T LIKE IT.</i>
<i>"DON'T SHOOT IT.</i>



IT'S TOO... OVERT,
THE MESSAGE.



IT HITS YOU OVER THE HEAD.
YOU CAN BE MUCH MORE <i>SUBTLE</i>".



<i>LATINO</i> IS WRITTEN AND DIRECTED



BY TWO-TIME OSCAR WINNER
HASKELL WEXLER.



IT IS A PRESENTATION OF GEORGE
LUCAS' COMPANY, LUCASFILM.



ITS STORY IS AS TOPICAL
AS TODAY'S HEADLINES,



AND EVERY MAJOR
STUDIO IN HOLLYWOOD



HAS REFUSED TO
DISTRIBUTE IT.



<i>THE MAJOR STUDIOS WOULD NOT
PICK UP</i> LATINO, <i>IN MY OPINION,</i>



<i>BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED IT WOULD
JUST BE TROUBLE FOR THEM--



<i>POLITICAL TROUBLE.



<i>CONTROVERSY IS--</i>
<i>IS THE FERTILIZER</i> <i>OF DEMOCRACY,</i>



AND I'M VERY MUCH IN FAVOR
OF IT, AND I'M PLEASED THAT



WE STILL HAVE ENOUGH FREEDOM
TO EXPRESS OURSELVES.



<i>HASKELL'S GREAT
SUCCESS AS A DIRECTOR</i>



<i>WAS</i> MEDIUM COOL.



<i>HE TOOK HIS ACTORS</i>
<i>AND PUT THEM INTO</i> <i>A REALITY.</i>



<i>AND SO,</i>
<i>TAKING THAT NOTION,</i>



LET'S PUT OUR ACTORS
INTO THE REALITY OF NICARAGUA



IN WHICH THERE'S A WAR
GOING ON BETWEEN THE CONTRAS



<i>AND THE SANDINISTA</i>
<i>GOVERNMENT.</i>



<i>FIRST OF ALL,</i>
<i>I WAS TERRIFIED ON</i> LATINO.



<i>I REMEMBER IT BEING</i>
<i>A VERY DIFFICULT SHOOT.</i>



<i>AND WHAT WAS REALLY STRANGE



<i>WAS THAT THE THINGS
THAT WE WERE FILMING



<i>WERE ACTUALLY HAPPENING
IN NICARAGUA,



<i>WHICH WAS AT THE HEIGHT
OF THE CONTRA WAR.</i>



<i>YOU COULD ALMOST</i>
<i>CALL IT GUERILLA FILMMAKING.</i>



<i>THERE WERE GUERILLAS THERE.</i>



<i>EVEN TO THE POINT WHERE,</i>
<i>IN A FIREFIGHT IN THE MOVIE,</i>



<i>THESE VERY ENTHUSIASTIC EXTRAS</i>
<i>STARTED TO USE LIVE AMMUNITION.</i>



SO THIS WAS-- I MEAN,
IT GOT VERY DICEY.



<i>BUT HE REALLY LOVED IT. I MEAN,
I THINK HE WAS IN HIS ELEMENT.



<i>WEXLER THINKS</i> <i>THE WHITE HOUSE,</i>



<i>WHICH OPPOSES THE SANDINISTA</i>
<i>REGIME IN NICARAGUA</i>



<i>WOULD BE, QUOTE,</i>



<i>"ECSTATIC," END QUOTE,</i> <i>IF</i> LATINO
<i>WERE NEVER SEEN</i> <i>OR FLOPPED.</i>



- MARY.
- THANK YOU, RONA.



<i>WELL, THE REAGAN
WHITE HOUSE GOT ITS WISH.</i>



LATINO <i>BOMBED</i>
<i>AT THE BOX OFFICE.</i>



<i>THE STRENGTH OF
BOTH</i> LATINO <i>AND</i> MEDIUM COOL



<i>ARE THE DOCUMENTARY ELEMENTS</i>
<i>KIND OF MEETING</i>



WITH THE FICTIONAL,
TRADITIONAL ELEMENTS IN THEM.



THAT'S A DIFFICULT
WAY TO SHOOT,



AND IT'S A WAY THAT MAKES
FINANCIERS NERVOUS,



BECAUSE IT'S NOT
ALL THERE ON THE PAGE.



<i>I WISH HASKELL
HAD DIRECTED MORE MOVIES</i>



<i>AND HAD BEEN A LITTLE MORE</i>
<i>APOLITICAL FROM TIME TO TIME,</i>



BECAUSE HE,
AS A DIRECTOR, WOULD HAVE MADE



SOME VERY ENGAGING PICTURES ABOUT
PEOPLE AND NOT JUST ABOUT CAUSES.



<i>FOR MY FATHER,</i>
<i>THE CAUSE ALWAYS COMES FIRST.</i>



<i>THE ONE THAT HE'S CURRENTLY
INVOLVED WITH IS THE FIGHT



<i>FOR SANER WORK HOURS</i>
<i>ON HOLLYWOOD FILM PRODUCTIONS.</i>



<i>HE'S MAKING</i>
<i>A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT IT.</i>



<i>HE'S ASKED ME TO HELP HIM</i>
<i>SHOOT JULIA ROBERTS,</i>



<i>WHO'S AGREED</i>
<i>TO AN INTERVIEW.</i> <i>I MUST CONFESS,</i>



<i>I GET A BIT NERVOUS</i>
<i>AROUND HOLLYWOOD ROYALTY.</i>



<i>MY FATHER,</i>
<i>THE OLD PRO, DOESN'T.</i>



<i>SO YOU THINK IT'S GONNA BE ALL
RIGHT FOR ME TO SHOOT TOMORROW?</i>



<i>I JUST DON'T KNOW</i>
<i>WHEN WE SHOULD DO IT.</i>



<i>I DON'T WANT YOU SHOOTING</i>
<i>WHEN I'M SHOOTING.</i>



THAT'S THE HOT SEAT?



THAT'S THE HOT SEAT.



<i>I WANT TO HAVE</i> <i>THE CONCENTRATION</i>



<i>ON THE MAIN THING.</i>



THE MAIN THING
IS <i>MY</i> MOVIE.



<i>WE DID SORT OF GET
IN EACH OTHER'S WAY AT FIRST,</i>



<i>BUT JULIA WAS</i>
<i>A GOOD SPORT ABOUT IT.</i>



IS THERE A REASON WHY
WE HAVE AN ARTICLE ON GAS?



IT'S THE FUNNIEST THING.
IT'S MY NUTRITION MAGAZINE.



YEAH, I JUST REFUSE
TO BE GASEOUS.



IT'S UNBECOMING.



<i>MARK, AM I PRESSING</i>
<i>THE WRONG BUTTONS HERE?</i>



- <i>I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S--</i>
- <i>STAND BY.</i>



JULIA, WE CAME HERE
BECAUSE WE HEARD



THAT YOU HAD SOME FEELINGS
ABOUT THE LONG HOURS.



WELL, FIRST,
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT--



<i>THE INTERVIEW WENT ALONG
SMOOTHLY. I LET DAD BE IN CHARGE,



<i>AND I TRIED TO STAY OUT OF
THE WAY THE BEST I COULD.



...AND THEN GO HOME
WITH THIS GREAT TRIUMPH



UNDER YOUR BELT
TO TAKE HOME TO YOUR FAMILY



WHEN YOU'RE NOT COMATOSE
AND A ZOMBIE



AND YOUR KIDS HAVE ALREADY
BEEN PUT TO BED



AND YOU'RE KIND OF
MISSING EVERYTHING.



SORRY.



HE BROUGHT
A STICK TO ME.



TAKE IT OUTSIDE, LOUIE.
OUT. OUT, OUT, OUT. COME ON.



HEY, MARKO, YOU'RE ALSO
GETTING IN JULIA'S SHOT,



<i>AND, UM--</i>



YOU AND LOUIE ARE TRYING
TO HOG MY CAMERA TIME.



UM--



<i>MARK, WE'RE THROUGH</i>
<i>WITH THE SHOOT. WE DID IT.</i>



IT WAS P--
I THINK IT WAS PERFECT.



THAT IF YOU HAVE
MILK PRODUCTS WITH NO FOOD,



IT'S LIKELY
TO BE GAS.



BUT THEN THEY
GO INTO ODORS, AND THEY SELL--



<i>YOU DEPORTED YOURSELF WELL,</i>



<i>AND YOU HELPED ME COVER</i>
<i>FOR MY LACK OF-- OF HEARING.</i>



<i>SO I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.</i>
<i>IT WAS REALLY GOOD.</i>



- <i>IT WAS FUN.</i>
- <i>YEAH, GOOD.</i>



I WOKE UP THIS MORNING,
AND I THOUGHT,



"I SEE MYSELF HAVING A
CONVERSATION ABOUT GAS



ON THE FRONT PORCH THIS MORNING--
I CAN JUST SEE IT HAPPENING".



I THINK NOW
I DESERVE TO, UH, TO TAKE A REST.



'CAUSE I HEARD DANNY ASK
HOW OLD YOUR FATHER IS.



I HEARD IT
ON THE THING, SEE?



AND, UH, I DON'T KNOW
WHETHER HE WAS ASKING



TO FIND OUT WHETHER HE SHOULD
GET ME A WHEELCHAIR OR WHAT,



BUT, UH,
IN ANY EVENT--



I'M NOT SURE I HEARD
YOUR RESPONSE, MARK, BUT--



ANYWAY, FOR THIS SHOOT,
WE DID GREAT. OKAY?



<i>WE WERE BOTH FEELING PRETTY
GOOD ABOUT OUR SHOOT WITH JULIA,</i>



<i>AND THERE WAS NO REAL RUSH</i>
<i>TO GET BACK TO LOS ANGELES,</i>



<i>SO I THOUGHT DAD AND I COULD SPEND
SOME TIME TOGETHER ENJOYING TAOS.



IT'S CALLED
A CIGASTO INDIAN.



MEANING
A CIGAR STORE INDIAN.



THIS IS WHAT
TOURISTS DO.



<i>WE GOT AN AMERICAN FLAG.</i>



OH, YEAH. YOU WANT ME TO KISS
IT FOR YOU OR SOMETHING, MARK?



<i>YEAH, YEAH.</i>
<i>THIS IS AMERICA.</i>



WATCH YOUR STEP.



<i>SO DAD, THIS IS ONE OF THE
OLDEST MISSIONS IN NEW MEXICO.



<i>I DID A STORY</i> <i>FOR</i>
SMITHSONIAN <i>MAGAZINE</i>



<i>ABOUT THE RESTORATION OF IT.</i>



<i>AND I SPENT, LIKE,</i>
<i>A WEEK HERE.</i>



THESE ARE THE ARTIFACTS
OF THE CONQUERORS,



THE PEOPLE THAT CAME IN
UNDER THE NAME OF JESUS



AND, UH, QUOTE,
"CIVILIZED" THE INHABITANTS,



THE NATIVES
WHO WERE HERE.



<i>WHY CAN'T YOU JUST APPRECIATE IT?</i>



<i>WHY DOES EVERYTHING
HAVE TO BE SO NEGATIVE?



MARK,
THIS IS NOT NEGATIVE.



THIS IS PART OF UNDERSTANDING
HISTORY AND EDUCATION.



IT'S ALSO--
BEYOND THAT,



IT'S BECAUSE YOU WANT
TO HAVE A FILM THAT, UH,



KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT
THE WAY I LOOK AT THINGS,



AND I LOOK AT THEM AS,
YES, THIS IS FINE,



THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL CHURCH,
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL STATUE,



<i>BUT IT REPRESENTS THE COLONIZATION
OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH



<i>AND PART OF THE DESTRUCTION
OF THE INDIAN RACE.



IF WE DON'T UNDERSTAND
HISTORY, WE WILL HAVE TO



SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES
IN THE PRESENT.



I KNEW YOU WHEN YOU
WERE A SMALL CHILD,



AND THEN I KNEW YOU
AS AN OLDER CHILD.



<i>AT THAT TIME, YOUR FATHER</i>
<i>WAS GOING THROUGH A DIVORCE,</i>



<i>AND IT MIGHT HAVE AFFECTED</i>



<i>YOUR RELATIONSHIP</i>
<i>WITH YOUR FATHER.</i>



<i>AND IT TAKES SOME TIME</i>
<i>TO GET OVER THE IDEA THAT</i>



YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE TOGETHER
IN A WONDERFUL FAMILY



ALL THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
AND ALL OF THAT KIND OF THING.



<i>THE THING</i>
<i>ABOUT IT IS THAT</i>



<i>YOU DON'T GIVE UP</i>
<i>THESE FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS.</i>



IT'S GREAT.



I REMEMBER THAT WE TOOK UP A VERY
FOND RELATIONSHIP AT THAT TIME



BECAUSE WE WERE
BOTH SORT OF...



FALSTAFFS,
I CALL IT.



<i>WE SAW A LOT</i>
<i>OF HUMOR IN LIFE.</i>



<i>BUT I WAS GLAD</i>
<i>TO HAVE A SURROGATE-FATHER</i>



<i>RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU,</i>



AND NOW THAT
YOU'RE GROWN UP,



UH, SO TO SPEAK,



<i>I THINK YOU'RE TRYING
TO GET TO KNOW YOUR FATHER



<i>IN AN EMOTIONAL WAY,



<i>WHICH MAY NOT HAVE BEEN
ACCESSIBLE EARLIER IN YOUR LIFE.



HERE'S THE OPENING
OF THE MOVIE.



IT'S AFTER THE WEDDING,
AND, LIKE, HERE'S THIS CAR



<i>SITTING ALL ALONE</i>
<i>OVER THERE,</i>



<i>AND, UH, YOU CAN'T SEE</i>
<i>THE PEOPLE INSIDE</i>



<i>BECAUSE OF THE REFLECTION</i>
<i>OF THE WHITE SKY.</i>



<i>AND WE MOVE IN</i>
<i>AND WE MOVE IN,</i> <i>AND, UH,</i>



THERE'S THIS SORT OF



BABY-TALK, YOU KNOW,
KIND OF STUFF?



AND THERE YOU ARE,
FATHER AND SON.



<i>HASKELL'S KIND OF
LIKE MY GODFATHER.</i>



UM, I SOMEHOW FEEL
A BOND TO YOUR DAD



THAT IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER
RELATIONSHIP I HAVE WITH,



YOU KNOW--



IT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE
I FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT YOUR DAD.



IN FACT, I ALWAYS TELL KATE,
"I WISH YOUR DAD WERE MY DAD.



I WISH I HAD HIM AS A DAD".
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE--



I TOLD MY DAD,
YOU KNOW--



<i>I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOUR
FILM. I HOPE THE FILM REALLY</i>



<i>DEALS WITH THINGS</i>
<i>BEYOND THE BUSINESS,</i> <i>SO TO SPEAK.</i>



<i>UM, AND-AND--</i>



SO HAVE YOU BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THAT A LOT?



QUESTIONS IN YOUR LIFE
THAT GO BEYOND YOUR CAREER?



ARE THOSE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN
GOING ON IN YOUR MIND RECENTLY?



<i>UH, YEAH. I--</i>



<i>ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT'S GOING
ON IN MY MIND VERY RECENTLY



<i>IS BEING WITH CONRAD HALL,</i>
<i>KNOWING THAT HE'S GOT CANCER,</i>



<i>AND KNOWING THAT</i>
<i>I'M 80-AND-A-HALF YEARS OLD--</i>



<i>OR ALMOST 81, ACTUALLY.</i>



<i>SO I THINK</i>
<i>ABOUT MORTALITY.</i>



<i>I'VE BEEN
ASKED TO REMIND YOU</i>



<i>THAT THOSE PUMPKINS ARE FOR SALE.</i>



<i>LET'S NOT FORGET--</i>
<i>HALLOWEEN IS COMING!</i>



HONEY, DO WE WANT TO BUY
A PUMPKIN, I THINK?



I'D LIKE TO BUY
A PUMPKIN.



<i>WHEN I SIT ON CONRAD'S
BED AND HOLD HIS HAND</i>



<i>AND JUST TALK</i>
<i>TO HIM ABOUT--</i>



<i>ABOUT OUR LIVES,</i>
<i>ABOUT FILMMAKING</i> <i>AND SO FORTH,</i>



<i>I THINK ABOUT HOW CONRAD IS
SINCE WE'RE MAKING THIS FILM--</i>



<i>HOW CONRAD IS</i>
<i>WITH HIS FAMILY,</i> <i>WITH HIS KIDS.</i>



I THINK THAT CONRAD
WAS ABLE TO DO



BETTER, MUCH BETTER,
THAN I DID.



<i>DID YOU HAVE</i>
<i>GIRLFRIENDS WHEN YOU WERE</i>



<i>MARRIED TO MY MOTHER?</i>



OH, YEAH.



<i>I, UH,</i>



<i>WAS PROBABLY</i>



<i>CONSIDERED AN ACTIVE MALE,</i>
<i>BUT NOT ACTIVE</i>



WITH MY HEART, REALLY.



<i>SHE...</i>



<i>SUSPECTED SOMETHING ONCE,</i>



<i>AND, UM,</i>
<i>I DISSUADED HER,</i>



<i>BECAUSE WHAT SHE SUSPECTED</i>



<i>WAS NOTHING THAT MEANT</i>
<i>ANYTHING TO ME.</i>



<i>HASKELL!</i>



<i>AH! JESUS!</i>



- OH MY GOD!
- <i>HI, JANE.</i>



SO, HOW ARE YOU
AFTER A THOUSAND YEARS?



<i>I CANNOT BELIEVE</i>
<i>HOW</i> NOT <i>MELLOWED HE SEEMS.</i>



<i>HE SEEMS EXACTLY</i>
<i>THE SAME ENERGETICALLY,</i>



<i>IN HIS KIND OF SPARKLE AND SENSE
OF HUMOR, THE WAY HE LOOKS--



AND MY KID IS TRYING
TO MAKE ME CRAZY



BY SHOOTING THIS DOCUMENTARY.



<i>I'M VERY SURPRISED</i>
<i>THAT HE HASN'T CHANGED MORE.</i>



TROY'S HERE!



SOMEBODY THAT HELPED
CHANGE YOUR DIAPERS IS HERE,



WHEN YOU'RE OFF THE PHONE.



SO YOU CHANGED
MY DIAPERS, HUH?



<i>WHEN TROY WAS BORN,</i>



<i>IT WAS A TIME OF
TREMENDOUS CONTROVERSY,</i>



<i>AND TOM HAYDEN AND I DECIDED
NOT TO BURDEN HIM WITH THE BAGGAGE



OF EITHER THE NAME
FONDA OR HAYDEN.



SO WE GAVE HIM THE NAME
OF HIS PATERNAL GRANDMOTHER,



<i>HER MAIDEN NAME,</i>
<i>GARITY.</i>



I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT



YOU'RE A GROWN
PERSON WITH ALL THAT TALENT.



<i>SO HE-- HE HAS</i> <i>HIS OWN NAME.</i>



WE'RE JUST GONNA TALK
FOR A WHILE, AND THEN--



IF THEY NEED
AN OLD CAMERAMAN



ON ANY OF YOUR JOBS,
NOW, GIVE ME A CALL.



- OH, YEAH.
- <i>OKAY. OKAY.</i>



<i>MY FATHER CAME OUT
OF AN IRISH BACKGROUND</i>



AND WAS A MARINE
IN WORLD WAR ll



<i>AND BECAME DEEPLY</i>
<i>DEPRESSED AND ANGRY</i>



<i>AT MY RADICAL</i>
<i>REBELLION AND JOURNEY,</i>



<i>AND FOR ABOUT 16 YEARS,</i>
<i>DENIED THAT I WAS HIS SON,</i>



<i>NEVER TALKED TO ME.</i>



ONE DAY HIS NEW WIFE YELLED
AT HIM, "YOU STUBBORN IRISHMAN!



WHY DON'T YOU PICK UP
THE PHONE AND CALL TOM?"



BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,



I WAS MARRIED
AND I HAD A CHILD--



UM, A SMALL CHILD, TROY.



<i>THE CHILDREN OF</i>
<i>THESE KINDS OF PARENTS</i>



<i>SPEND THE REST OF OUR LIVES</i>
<i>HEALING FROM THAT.</i>



AND THE IMPORTANT THING
IS TO UNDERSTAND



THAT IT'S SOMETHING
THAT <i>HE</i> INHERITED--



YOU CAN BE SURE
HIS FATHER WAS THE SAME--



<i>AND THAT WE HAVE TO
UNDERSTAND AND FORGIVE THEM.



<i>IT'S NOT HIS FAULT.



<i>THE MOST IMPORTANT</i> <i>THING FOR ME</i>



<i>IS TO BECOME</i>
<i>A USEFUL ELDER TO MY KIDS.</i>



<i>AND PART OF BECOMING</i>
<i>A USEFUL ELDER IS</i>



CUTTING OFF THE TOXIC
TRANSMISSION OF...



ALL OF THESE COMPLEXES THAT
ARE PASSED FROM FATHER TO SON,



<i>IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR
MEN OF OUR FATHERS' GENERATION.</i>



INTIMACY WAS NOT
THEIR GIFT.



THEY'RE BOTH...



EMPATHIC PEOPLE.



YOU COULDN'T BE THE KIND
OF ACTOR MY FATHER WAS



OR THE KIND
OF CINEMATOGRAPHER



AND DOCUMENTARIAN
THAT YOUR FATHER IS



WITHOUT BEING EMPATHIC,



BUT INTIMACY SCARES THEM.



HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE YOU'VE
SEEN <i>INTRODUCTION TO THE ENEMY?</i>



I HAVEN'T SEEN IT
IN A LONG TIME.



- HAVE YOU?
- OH, I-- YEAH, YEAH.



<i>IN 1974, TOM HAYDEN,</i>
<i>MY HUSBAND AT THE TIME,</i>



<i>DECIDED WITH ME THAT WE</i>
<i>WANTED TO DO A FILM CALLED</i>



INTRODUCTION TO THE ENEMY



<i>THAT WOULD HUMANIZE</i>
<i>THE VIETNAMESE.</i>



<i>AND HASKELL SEEMED LIKE</i>
<i>THE PERFECT PERSON TO FILM IT.</i>



<i>BEING IN HANOI NOW</i>



<i>IS LIKE SEEING A CITY</i>
<i>THAT'S COME BACK TO LIFE.</i>



<i>PARTLY BECAUSE OF HIS
GIFT AS A DOCUMENTARIAN</i>



<i>AND ALSO BECAUSE</i>
<i>OF HIS VALUES</i>



<i>AS A HUMAN BEING.</i>



<i>IT WAS VERY CRUDE, AND WE DID GO
ACROSS THE D.M.Z. INTO THE SOUTH,</i>



<i>AND IT WAS DIFFICULT.</i>



AND, UM, IT WAS
MOVING FOR ME TO



WATCH HASKELL
UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES.



I MEAN, HASKELL
COMES FROM



<i>A PRIVILEGED PLACE</i>
<i>IN SOCIETY.</i>



<i>HE COMES FROM MONEY. HE'S BEEN
ABLE TO LIVE WELL ALL HIS LIFE.



<i>AND FOR PEOPLE LIKE US--</i>



<i>HASKELL AND ME, 'CAUSE I</i>
<i>ALSO COME FROM PRIVILEGE--</i>



<i>THERE'S ALWAYS</i>
<i>A TENSION BETWEEN, UM,</i>



HOW WE LIVE AND WHAT WE ARE ABLE
TO DO BECAUSE OF OUR CLASS AND RACE



<i>UP AGAINST PEOPLE</i>
<i>WHO ARE NOT PRIVILEGED.</i>



<i>AND THAT WAS CERTAINLY</i>
<i>THE CASE IN VIETNAM.</i>



WHEN DID YOU DECIDE TO, UH,
JOIN THE RESISTANCE, AND WHY?



<i>AND I JUST REMEMBER ONE DAY
HE CAME DOWN TO BREAKFAST</i>



<i>AND HE SAID, "HOW--</i>
<i>HOW HAVE YOU DONE IT?</i>



<i>HOW HAVE YOU JUST</i>
<i>GIVEN IT ALL UP?"</i>



<i>AND I DON'T REMEMBER</i>
<i>WHAT I SAID,</i>



<i>BUT OF COURSE I HADN'T</i>
<i>GIVEN IT ALL UP ANYWAY.</i>



<i>BUT I WAS SO TOUCHED



THAT HE WAS SEARCHING
THAT WAY WITHIN HIMSELF.



THAT'S THE KIND
OF PERSON HE IS.



<i>OH, MY GOD. THERE'S
SO MUCH. YOU MISS HAL?</i>



<i>I DO, VERY MUCH.</i>



<i>YOU WERE SUCH</i>
<i>AN INCREDIBLE PARTNERSHIP.</i>



<i>HIS STYLE</i>
<i>AND YOUR STYLE</i>



WAS SO SYNCHRONISTIC.



YEAH, I REALLY
MISS HIM.



<i>WASN'T THAT FUN,</i>
<i>THAT MOVIE,</i> COMING HOME?



<i>IN</i> COMING HOME,
<i>I THINK</i> <i>I REMEMBER CORRECTLY</i>



<i>WHEN WE HAD THE NAKED SCENE
IN BED...</i> -<i>OH, GOD, YES.</i>



<i>AND I REMEMBER</i>
<i>ON "CUT,"</i>



<i>YOU GOT UP AND WENT TO THE PHONE
AND TALKED TO CESAR CHAVEZ.



I DON'T REMEMBER THAT!



YOU JUST FINISHED MAKING
THESE ORGIASTIC SOUNDS,



AND THEY PUT A BATHROBE--



"OH, HI, CESAR". -YEAH.



AS YOU CAN SEE,
AFTER FIVE YEARS, WE GET DOWN.



- WE JUST GO RIGHT DOWN THERE.
- RIGHT!



WE GO RIGHT TO IT.



COULD YOU TAKE
THIS THING OFF OF ME? AND ALSO,



I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
I HAVE NOT SIGNED A RELEASE FOR HIM,



SO BEFORE HE FINISHES
THIS FILM,



IF THERE'S ANYTHING--
IF THERE'S ANYTHING



THAT I DON'T LIKE
OR YOU DON'T LIKE, OUTSVILLE.



BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, HE'S
A VERY CONSERVATIVE PERSON.



<i>ACTUALLY, BEFORE I TAKE
THAT OFF, HOLD ON ONE SECOND.</i>



<i>YES, MARK.</i>



<i>MARK, THIS IS</i>
<i>CINEMA VERITE.</i>



<i>THIS IS SO IMPORTANT.</i>
<i>THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO HIM.</i>



AND IT'S NOT EASY, 'CAUSE HE'S
TRODDING INTO YOUR WORLD NOW,



AND HE'S SCARED TO DEATH.



YEAH.
YOU NOTICED THAT?



- I GIVE HIM A HARD TIME.
- THAT'S GOOD.



<i>MOST PEOPLE
PERFORM IN RELATIONSHIP</i>



<i>TO THEIR PARENTS</i>
<i>OR THEIR CHILDREN.</i>



<i>THEY'RE NOT HONEST.</i>



THEY ACT HONEST TO YOU
RATHER THAN BEING HONEST,



SO WHATEVER MY ADVICE IS,
WHATEVER SOMEBODY TELLS YOU



AS THE HONEST ANSWER
TO A QUESTION,



GO DEEPER, BECAUSE
IT'S MORE LIKELY TO BE A FRONT--



UNCONSCIOUSLY, A FRONT--



FOR WHAT THEY REALLY
DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT.



<i>HAVE YOU DONE OTHER
SHOOTING OF MARIAN HERE?</i>



<i>UH, SOME STILLS.</i>



<i>I'D LIKE TO BRING MY MOTHER OUT



<i>IN THE WHEELCHAIR IN HERE
FOR THIS AIR.</i>



YOU SURE SHE'LL BE
WARM ENOUGH? -<i>HUH?</i>



I HOPE
SHE'LL BE WARM ENOUGH.



THAT'S ALL RIGHT.



HERE, I GOT IT.



<i>HI. HI, MOM.</i>



- HOW ARE YOU?
- <i>HOW ARE YOU?</i>



HI, MARE. HI, MARE, IT'S
HASKELL. HOW ARE YOU, HONEY?



HOW ARE YOU, MARIAN? SO MARK
IS HERE TAKING YOUR PICTURE.



HE'S TAKING YOUR PICTURE.



WE'RE JUST GONNA GET SOMETHING
TO MAKE YOU A LITTLE WARMER.



LET'S PUT
YOUR SWEATER ON.



LITTLE BIT CHILLY
THIS MORNING.



THERE, WE GET THIS
OVER HER.



IT'S A COOL DAY.
I WAS IN CHICAGO YESTERDAY,



<i>AND, UM, I WENT BY,</i>
<i>THE WILMETTE THEATER,</i>



<i>WHICH IS</i>
<i>NO LONGER THERE.</i>



<i>AND, UH, UNCLE PETE'S
HOUSE IS TORN DOWN.



AND THE WILMETTE'S
ALL DIFFERENT NOW.



REMEMBER WE USED TO GO--
WE WENT TO DIMETRI'S



AND WE GOT SANDWICHES?



WE RODE ON
THE OUTER DRIVE.



WE'VE GOT SECRETS.
WE'VE GOT SECRETS.



WE KNOW THINGS--
YOU, ME.



WE KNOW THINGS
ABOUT EACH OTHER.



I KNOW.



YES, THAT NOBODY ELSE
IN THE WORLD KNOWS.



<i>DAD, I JUST WANT YOU</i>
<i>TO KNOW THAT I'M NOT--</i>



<i>I ALWAYS FELT THAT YOU
THOUGHT THAT I WAS MAD AT YOU</i>



<i>ABOUT BREAKING UP WITH MY MOM,
AND I'M NOT MAD ANYMORE.</i>



GOOD. I KNEW YOU DID,
AND THAT BOTHERED ME.



BREAKING UP
OR STOP BEING MARRIED



AND SO FORTH
AFTER THAT MANY YEARS--



AND NOT--



NOT, LIKE,
BAD YEARS, YOU KNOW?



ALL I CAN--
ALL I CAN THINK OF



WHEN I WAS TALKING TO HER
WAS HOW MUCH ENJOYMENT,



HOW MUCH PLEASURE
WE GAVE EACH OTHER.



<i>YOUR MOTHER WAS</i>
<i>AN INCREDIBLY GOOD ARTIST.</i>



<i>I WAS THINKING--</i>
<i>WE WERE ON A LAKE</i> <i>IN GUATEMALA.</i>



<i>LAKE PANAJACHEL.</i>
<i>SHE WOULD PAINT</i>



<i>AND I WOULD SHOOT,</i>
<i>AND, UM,</i>



<i>IT WAS LIKE--</i>



IT WAS LOVE, YOU KNOW?



<i>WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?</i>



<i>ALL I CAN JUST SAY IS,</i>



<i>PEOPLE LOOK FOR DIFFERENT</i>
<i>THINGS IN THEIR LIFE.</i>



<i>IT'S HARD TO PUT BLAME</i>
<i>ON ME JUST</i>



<i>WANTING TO BE</i>
<i>A BIG-SHOT CAMERAMAN</i>



<i>AND MARIAN NOT BEING</i>
<i>WITH IT, OR--</i>



<i>YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO--</i>
<i>IT'S NONE OF THOSE THINGS.</i>



<i>IT'S THOSE-- IT'S THOSE</i>
<i>SUBTLE HUMAN THINGS THAT--</i>



<i>THAT WE SELDOM REALLY...</i>
<i>UNDERSTAND.</i>



SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, MARK?
WHAT'S-- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?



AND HOW ARE YOU
GONNA DIFFERENTIATE



THIS... THING,



THIS <i>SCENE</i> THAT HAPPENED?



BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE CAMERA,
AND IN A SENSE, IT, UM--



IN A SENSE,
IT COLORS A SITUATION.



I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
FOR MYSELF,



I KNEW YOUR CAMERA WAS THERE,
BUT I DIDN'T GIVE A SHIT.



I MEAN--
AND I THINK THAT, UM--



AND NOW I'M THINKING,



"WELL, MAYBE THE CAMERA
SORT OF INVADED



SOMETHING DEEPLY
PERSONAL TO ME".



AND THEN
I SHOULD SAY, WELL,



"SO WHAT?"
YOU KNOW? SO WHAT?



<i>IT DIDN'T STOP</i>
<i>THE REAL THING.</i>



<i>I APPRECIATE YOU</i>
<i>TRUSTING ME WITH THAT.</i>



SO WHAT WE DO IS,
WE WRITE IT ALL UP



AND OF COURSE,
WE'LL TALK NUMBERS AND WHAT,



GIVE YOU AN IDEA
OF WHAT WE THINK



CERTAIN GEAR WOULD BE SELLING
FOR NOW ON THE CURRENT MARKET--



<i>IT WAS A BIG MOMENT
FOR HASKELL TO</i> DEPART,



TO CONSIDER SELLING
HIS CAMERA GEAR.



IT'S ALWAYS
SO CLOSE TO HIM.



SO LIKE YOU SAID,
HE WAS MENTALLY NOT PREPARED.



NOW, YOU SEE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS--



I MEAN, THIS KIND OF THING
HAS GOT TO BE SOLD WITH-WITH LOVE,



'CAUSE THIS INCREDIBLE CAMERA
HAD THIS MOTOR ADAPTED TO IT.



<i>I MEAN, YOU WILL MAKE</i>
<i>THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PICTURES--</i>



I'LL TAKE A COUPLE
OF LIGHT ONES. I LEARNED THAT--



TO GRAB THE SMALL CASES.



<i>AND WHEN I LOOK</i> <i>AT HASKELL,</i>



<i>I SEE A TORTURED SOUL,</i>



BECAUSE HE KNOWS IT'S CLOSE
TO THE END OF THE LINE



IN TERMS OF WORK.



BUT FOR YEARS,
I SAW THIS.



<i>HE'S GOT TO DO MORE.</i>
<i>HE'S GOT TO DO BETTER.</i>



<i>HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN</i>
<i>A DIRECTOR.</i>



<i>HE COULD HAVE SHOWN</i>
<i>THESE GUYS HOW TO DO IT.</i>



<i>IT'S ALL "SHOULD'VE".</i>
<i>AND THE SHOULD'VES</i>



ARE A CURSE.



<i>MARK AND I HAVE HAD</i>
<i>OUR DIFFERENCES IN LIFE,</i>



AND CONRAD WAS SORT OF
A FOSTER FATHER TO MARK



AND A REALLY
GENUINELY GOOD GUY,



AND I KNOW-- I SUSPECT
WHY HE WAS:



<i>'CAUSE MARK AND CONRAD</i>
<i>LAUGHED TOGETHER.</i>



<i>I LOOKED AT 'EM ONCE TALKING,</i>
<i>AND I SAID TO MYSELF,</i> <i>"GODDAMN IT,</i>



HE LIKES CONRAD MORE
THAN HE LIKES ME".



IT IS TRUE, NOT EVERYONE CAN
BE ALL THINGS TO ALL PEOPLE.



<i>I CAN TELL</i>
<i>THAT HE LOVES YOU,</i>



<i>AND HE IS SCARED OF</i>
<i>WHAT YOU MAY DO TO HIM</i>



OR EXPOSE IN HIM
IN THIS FILM.



<i>I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S</i>
<i>ANYTHING MORE IMPORTANT</i>



<i>THAN MAKING PEACE</i>
<i>BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.</i>



<i>MAYBE I'M TOO TIGHT.</i>
<i>THIS IS HARD TO FOCUS.</i>



<i>AND IT ALMOST ALWAYS
RELIES ON THE CHILD</i>



<i>TO MOVE</i> TO <i>THE PARENT.</i>



IF YOU JUST SET
THE FOCUS RIGHT HERE



AND THEN MEET ME
WITH THE ZOOM--



NEVER MIND CHANGING
FOCUS AT ALL. -<i>OKAY. OKAY.</i>



- OKAY?
- <i>BUT JUST BE PATIENT.</i>



'CAUSE THAT SPEAKS VOLUMES.



AND IT'S AN INVITATION.
PATIENCE IS ALWAYS AN INVITATION.



<i>OKAY.</i>



<i>BECAUSE IT'S FILLED</i> <i>WITH SUCH HOPE.</i>



<i>AH. THAT'S BETTER.</i>
