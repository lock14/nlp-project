THE STUFF YOU SEE AROUND HERE,
WHICH IS JUST, LIKE,
CAMERA EQUIPMENT
AND SO FORTH
IS-- IS VERY MUCH
A PART OF MY LIFE.
THIS-- THIS MAGAZINE
I HAVE RIGHT HERE--
THIS KA-61--
THIS MAGAZINE,
UH, WAS WITH ME
ON THE DECK
WHEN I SHOT
AMERICA AMERICA.
DAD, CAN YOU TELL US
WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW AND--
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE
THE FUCK WE ARE RIGHT NOW,
JUST LOOK AROUND.
YOU'RE MAKING
A GODDAMN DOCUMENTARY,
SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ME
SAY IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA
WHERE WE ARE.
YOU DID A SHOT
OF SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT,
DAD-- -YOU GET A SHOT
OF THE SIGN, YOU KNOW?
DAD, YOU MIGHT WANT TO TELL US
THAT WE'RE IN YOUR EQUIPMENT ROOM,
YOU'VE HAD IT
FOR SEVERAL YEARS, AND YOU--
WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY?
WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY?
MARK, I--
LOOKIT.
DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKING, MY KIND,
ANYWAY, IS NOT SHOW-AND-TELL.
IN OTHER WORDS, I DON'T TELL
THEM WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN,
WHAT'S THE SCENE, AND SO FORTH.
IN OTHER WORDS,
IF YOU SHOOT A SCENE,
IF THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENS,
THEN IT WILL BE CLEAR
TO THE AUDIENCE.
THEN IT HAS
SOME VALIDITY.
OTHERWISE, IT LOSES
ITS... HONESTY.
AND SO I'M TELLING YOU
TWO THINGS--
ONE IS, WHATEVER HAPPENS
IN THIS ROOM
IS GONNA HAPPEN
IN THIS ROOM.
IF YOU GET IT,
THAT'S FINE.
IF YOU DON'T GET IT,
TOUGH SHIT.
EVEN THOUGH I'VE MADE
SEVERAL DOCUMENTARIES IN THE PAST,
THE IDEA OF DOING
ONE OF MY FATHER SEEMS DAUNTING.
I RECOGNIZE ALL
MY DAD'S ACHIEVEMENTS,
AND I RESPECT HIS POSITION IN
THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN CINEMA,
BUT I'M NOT EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'D CALL A FAN.
I'M A SON, THE SON
OF A FAMOUS FATHER,
AND I'VE SPENT MUCH OF MY
ADULT LIFE STRUGGLING TO STEP OUT
FROM UNDER THE SHADOW
OF THAT FAME.
I REMEMBER HAVING DINNER
WITH YOU AND MARIAN
AND HASKELL
AT A RESTAURANT
IN LOS ANGELES.
AND WE CAME OUT,
AND THERE WAS SOMEONE THAT
YOU WANTED TO TALK TO,
BUT YOU WERE A LITTLE SHY
ABOUT APPROACHING THEM.
AND HASKELL TURNED
TO YOU AND SAID,
"GO AHEAD.
TELL THEM WHO YOU ARE".
AND YOUR MOTHER SAID,
"WHAT HE MEANS IS,
TELL THEM THAT YOU'RE
HASKELL WEXLER'S SON".
AND WHO IS HASKELL WEXLER?
HE'S A CINEMATOGRAPHER.
OH!
- WELL--
- ARE WE GONNA BE ON TV?
SOME HAVE CALLED MY FATHER
THE BABE RUTH OF CINEMATOGRAPHY,
AND HE'S WORKED WITH
SUCH HEAVY HITTERS
AS JACK NICHOLSON,
ELIZABETH TAYLOR AND PAUL NEWMAN.
YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK
AT THE BODY OF WORK,
THE MOMENTS HE'S CREATED
OR CAPTURED OR INVENTED,
AND YOU GO,
"THIS IS ALMOST THE HISTORY
OF CONTEMPORARY FILM
HASKELL HAS HAD A HAND IN
OR A CAMERA IN
OR A LENS IN".
EVERY CINEMATOGRAPHER
HAS HIS OWN WAY OF
LOOKING AT THE WORLD.
IT'S LIKE, EVERY STILL
PHOTOGRAPHER OR EVERY PAINTER.
IN THE BEGINNING,
WHEN I WAS IN FILM SCHOOL,
I WAS VERY MUCH INTO THAT
VERY REALISTIC-LOOKING
PHOTOGRAPHY.
AND THAT IS THE KIND OF
STYLE OF PHOTOGRAPHY
THAT, REALLY,
HASKELL SPECIALIZED IN.
WE ALL HAVE OUR OWN INSTRUMENTS,
AND HASKELL'S
INSTRUMENT IS--
I ALWAYS THINK OF IT
AS THE HAND-HELD CAMERA.
HE'S A GREAT FILMMAKER
AND A GREAT
CINEMATOGRAPHER
AND, OF COURSE,
A DEAR FRIEND.
THE MINUTE I MET HIM
ON COMING HOME,
I KNEW THAT THIS WAS
AS IT SHOULD BE-- IT WAS MAGICAL.
IT WAS MAGICAL.
HE WAS SUCH A PERFECTIONIST
AND HE HAS SUCH A SKILL
AND A TALENT AND AN INSIGHT
TO WHAT HE DID FOR A LIVING,
AND HE HAD SUCH PRIDE IN IT.
YOUR FATHER WAS BORN
WITH MONEY,
BUT HE'S THE HARDEST WORKER
I'VE EVER SEEN,
AND HIS FEELING FOR THE WORKERS
CERTAINLY PUTS HIM INTO A--
IT'S VERY MUCH LIKE
DIEGO RIVERA IN MY MIND.
HE'S BEEN ARRESTED,
THROWN IN JAIL,
THREATENED WITH GUNS,
THE F.B.I. PROBABLY
HAD A FILE ON HIM.
HE DIDN'T GIVE A DAMN,
YOU KNOW?
HE'S WHAT I CALL
A TRUE AMERICAN LIBERAL.
AND PROBABLY NOT EVEN THAT.
HE'D PROBABLY HATE THAT WORD.
BUT HE BELIEVES IN THE DOWNTRODDEN
AND THE DISPOSSESSED.
YOU KNOW, YOU CANNOT HELP
BUT ADMIRE THIS PERSON.
MY FATHER'S CAREER
AS A DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY
SPANS MORE THAN FIVE DECADES
OF WORKING IN FEATURES,
DOCUMENTARIES
AND COMMERCIALS.
HE'S EVEN WRITTEN, DIRECTED
AND PRODUCED HIS OWN FILMS.
BUT HE'S BEST KNOWN AND MOST
APPRECIATED FOR HIS CAMERA WORK.
AMERICAN GRAFFITI
WAS VERY FAST-PACED,
AND SO IT WAS A FILM
MADE IN CHAOS.
THE FIRST WEEK WE WERE
SHOOTING IN THE DRIVE-IN,
AND HE SAID, "WELL, WE'LL
MAKE THIS KIND OF LIKE A JUKE BOX,"
AND HE REALLY ADDED
A LOT OF QUALITY TO THE WHOLE THING
THAT I HADN'T REALLY
THOUGHT OF.
EVERYBODY INVOLVED
IN THE MOVIE FROM THE ACTING SIDE
DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT
GEORGE LUCAS
BUT WAS VERY IMPRESSED
THAT HASKELL WEXLER
WAS KILLING HIMSELF
TO COME WORK ON THIS MOVIE.
I MEAN, IT WAS INSANE.
HE WOULD SHOOT
A COMMERCIAL DURING THE DAY
IN LOS ANGELES,
THEN FLY INTO SAN FRANCISCO,
DRIVE TO MARIN COUNTY
WORK THERE UNTIL DAWN,
AND THEN GO GET ON A PLANE,
AND HE WAS DOING THIS, YOU KNOW,
NOT JUST ONCE IN A WHILE.
IT SEEMED LIKE HE WAS JUST
DOING IT THREE, FOUR NIGHTS A WEEK.
THEY CALL ME MR. TIBBS.
IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT
FOLLOWED THE STORY
OF THIS BLACK DETECTIVE.
THERE'S A SCENE
WHERE THEY PUT THE DOGS--
YOU KNOW, THE SOUTHERNERS ARE
ALWAYS USING DOGS-- HOUNDS--
AND HE PUT THE BLOODHOUNDS
OR THE HOUNDS ON HIM.
OF COURSE, THERE WERE
NO STEADICAMS IN THOSE DAYS.
YOUR DAD IS ALSO
A DIRECTOR,
SO I'M SURE THAT HE HAD
SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR NORMAN.
YOUR DAD HAD A TINY,
LITTLE ECLAIR CAMERA--
IT SOUNDED LIKE
A COFFEE GRINDER--
AND HE USED TO
HAND-HOLD EVERYTHING.
SO HE GOT A COUPLE
OF TWO-BY-FOURS,
MOUNTED THE CAMERA
ABOUT THE HEIGHT OF A DOG,
AND, ON A WIDE-ANGLE LENS,
WE JUST FOLLOWED THIS GUY
THROUGH THE BUSH.
BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOME
GOOD SHOTS THERE.
MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN
ABOUT MY DAD.
HE'S A TWO-TIME
OSCAR WINNER,
A SOUGHT-AFTER VOICE
FOR DVD COMMENTARIES,
AND THE MOTION PICTURE ACADEMY
IS PREPARING AN ORAL
HISTORY ON HIS CAREER.
PUSHING 80,
HE'S A RIPE SUBJECT FOR A TRIBUTE,
THOUGH I GUESS HE MAY HAVE SOME
SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT HIS SON
PICKING UP THE CAMERA
AND TURNING THE LENS ON HIM.
I AM NOT THOSE PICTURES.
I AM HASKELL WEXLER
AND YOU'RE MY SON.
NOW, I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY
YOU WANT TO TALK TO
SOME OF THE WELL-KNOWN PEOPLE
WHO HAVE BEEN
IN MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE--
OH, HASKELL!
I MEAN, WHAT-- WHAT DOES
AN ACTOR SAY ABOUT A LEGEND?
BUT I DON'T WANT
THAT KIND OF BIOGRAPHY.
I'M NOT GONNA SAY I WAS
LIKE A SON TO HIM,
BUT IT WAS
SORT OF LIKE THAT.
I WAS, LIKE, THE STUDENT
AND HE WAS, LIKE, THE TEACHER.
I WOULD LIKE TO
BE ABLE TO USE
OUR FILMMAKING-- MAYBE EVEN
ABOUT EACH OTHER A LITTLE BIT--
TO BREAK DOWN SOME OF THE
WALLS THAT-- THAT HAPPEN
AS WITH ANY
FATHERS AND SONS AS THEY GET OLDER
AND THEY GET
MORE INDEPENDENT.
SO WHAT'S HE SAYING?
NO STORIES ABOUT LIZ TAYLOR
FEELING UP HIS LIGHT METER
ON VIRGINIA WOOLF?
NO STORIES ABOUT
HIM GETTING FIRED
AND RE-HIRED BY A
COKED-UP HAL ASHBY?
NO STORIES ABOUT
HOW HE'D LOAN
LITTLE RONNIE HOWARD
GRIP EQUIPMENT
TO MAKE HIS FIRST
STUDENT FILMS?
NO MENTION OF
CANADIAN BACON, BLAZE,
UNCLE MEAT
OR THE LOVED ONE?
YOU MEAN, I'LL HAVE TO
SCRAP THAT GREAT INTERVIEW
WITH JONATHAN WINTERS?
I'VE GOT YOU IN THIS FRAME.
I'M NOT FRAMING YOU.
I'VE JUST GOT YOU
IN THIS FRAME MOMENTARILY.
I JUST THINK THAT IT WOULD BE
A MORE INTERESTING
AND DIFFERENT FILM
IF WE HAD
ENOUGH NERVE, REALLY,
TO REVEAL CERTAIN FEELINGS,
CERTAIN THOUGHTS,
CERTAIN THINGS ABOUT MARIAN,
CERTAIN THINGS ABOUT
YOUR CHILDHOOD,
CERTAIN THINGS ABOUT...
ME AND MY GIRLFRIENDS,
YOU KNOW?
UM, THOSE THINGS
WHICH, UM--
WHICH ARE MORE PROFOUND THAN
JUST THE PROFESSIONAL THINGS.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
WE PROUDLY WELCOME
TO THE HOLLYWOOD WALK OF FAME
MR. HASKELL WEXLER.
THERE IT IS.
IT'S ACCURATE TO SAY
THAT WHAT I DO
FOR A LIVING,
WHICH IS MAKING MOVIES,
IS NOT ME.
AND IF YOU WANT TO MAKE
THE KIND OF DOCUMENTARY
I HOPE WE'RE MAKING,
AT SOME POINT,
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HOLLYWOOD
AND INTO, UH--
INTO HERE, INTO HERE.
I CUT YOUR HEADS OFF
JUST PERFECT RIGHT HERE.
FIVE BUCKS.
TO BE HONEST,
I NEVER THOUGHT OF MY FATHER
AS SOMEONE WHO WAS WILLING TO
SHARE HIS MORE PERSONAL SIDE.
- CONGRATULATIONS, HASKELL!
- BUT I'M GAME IF HE IS.
I'M SURPRISED THAT AFTER SUCH A
HIGH-PROFILE CAREER IN FILMS,
HE SUDDENLY DOESN'T WANT
TO BE DEFINED BY IT.
BUT IF HE'S NOT HIS WORK,
THEN WHO IS HE?
HASKELL WEXLER,
THE HOLLYWOOD LIBERAL?
HASKELL WEXLER,
THE LADIES' MAN?
HASKELL WEXLER,
THE CAR COLLECTOR?
WHAT I REALLY WANT
TO EXPLORE,
AND MAYBE THIS FILM IS
THE WAY TO DO IT,
IS WHO HASKELL WEXLER,
THE FATHER, IS.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
MARK, I-I'M DOING--
AND IT'S VERY CLEAR--
I DO WHAT I ALWAYS DO.
I TAKE THE NEW YORK TIMES
OBITUARY AVERAGE.
I HAVE...
A WRITER/PSYCHOLOGIST--
87 YEARS OLD.
MICHAEL DE LISIO, 91,
A SCULPTOR.
AND BURTON FELDMAN, 76.
WELL, HE KNOCKED IT DOWN,
BUT STILL
THE AVERAGE
SHOULD HAVE ME LIVING
AT LEAST ANOTHER
YEAR AND A HALF... AT LEAST.
MY DAD THINKS A LOT
ABOUT HIS AGE THESE DAYS.
I GUESS THE PARTY WE THREW
FOR HIS 80th BIRTHDAY
DIDN'T EXACTLY TAKE
HIS MIND OFF IT EITHER,
BUT IT WAS QUITE
A DAY TO REMEMBER.
MY HALF-BROTHER AND -SISTER,
JEFF AND KATHY, WERE THERE.
THEY ARE THE CHILDREN
FROM MY FATHER'S FIRST MARRIAGE.
I'M THE ONLY CHILD
FROM THE SECOND MARRIAGE.
HIS THIRD WIFE, RITA,
PUT THE WHOLE PARTY TOGETHER,
AND I THOUGHT IT
A GOOD IDEA TO TAPE IT.
IT WOULD BE GREAT TO GET
SOME TESTIMONIALS
AND SOME FUNNY BIRTHDAY SPEECHES.
SOME OF THESE GUYS CAN BE
REAL CUTUPS.
IF YOU'RE DOING TELEVISION,
YOU SHOULD USE THIS CAMERA.
MANY WERE OLD FAMILY FRIENDS,
BUT SINCE I WAS BEHIND THE CAMERA,
IT MADE ME A BIT NERVOUS TO HAVE
SO MANY SUCCESSFUL FILMMAKERS
WATCHING MY EVERY MOVE.
THE WEAK POINT IS,
WHO'S BEHIND IT, AND--
WAIT A SECOND!
BUT THE SOUND, REALLY.
I'M NOT GONNA GO ON A DOCUMENTARY
WITHOUT HAVING A SOUND PERSON.
NO, YOU STILL DO NEED
A SOUND GUY WITH A BOOM.
I SHOULD'VE
TAKEN THEIR ADVICE
AND HIRED A SEPARATE SOUND MAN.
I DIDN'T REALIZE UNTIL LATER
THAT MY MIC CONNECTION FAILED,
AND SO I HAVE TWO HOURS
OF UNUSABLE FOOTAGE.
I DON'T WANT TO TELL
MY DAD ABOUT MY SCREW-UP.
THERE'S A LOT MORE SHOOTING
TO DO WITH HIM,
AND I NEED HIM TO TRUST ME
AS A FILMMAKER.
I JUST WANT-- I JUST
WANT SOMETHING IN THE MIRROR.
NOW, MARK, WE STARTED THERE,
AND WHY DID WE STOP?
- THERE'S A FOCUS PROBLEM?
- YEAH.
WHOSE FOCUS PROBLEM?
IT LOOKS LIKE MY CAMERA'S IN FOCUS.
YOU KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN AROUND
THREE DIFFERENT ANGLES NOW.
DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE A
PERFECTIONIST OR YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT THE HELL
YOU'RE DOING?
TURN-TURN
YOUR HEAD THIS WAY.
PRETTY SOON WE'D BETTER
GET TO THE SUBJECT
OF YOUR GODDAMN SHOW,
BECAUSE, UM,
I'VE GOT FISH TO FRY.
MY DAD'S FATHER,
SIMON WEXLER, MADE HIS FORTUNE
IN THE EARLY DAYS
OF THE ELECTRONICS BUSINESS.
DURING THE DEPRESSION, HIS FAMILY
WAS ONE OF THE FEW THAT PROSPERED,
TAKING LAVISH TRIPS ABROAD
AND ENROLLING THE CHILDREN
IN EXPENSIVE PRIVATE SCHOOLS.
MY FATHER WAS NEVER
COMFORTABLE AS THE BOSS'S SON,
AND OFTEN TRIED TO REBEL
AGAINST HIS PRIVILEGED HOME LIFE.
IN JUNIOR HIGH,
HE AND FRIEND BARNEY ROSSET
PUBLISHED A WEEKLY NEWSLETTER
CALLED AGAINST EVERYTHING.
LATER, HE'D HELP
ORGANIZE A STRIKE BY THE WORKERS
IN HIS FATHER'S FACTORY.
AND ALL DURING THE WAR, YOU KNOW,
I HAD ALL KINDS OF THINGS
WHICH WERE EXCITING
AND INTERESTING TO ME.
I LEARNED TO, UH, NAVIGATE.
I BECAME A SECOND OFFICER.
UM, I FELT
I WAS A MAN.
DURING WORLD WAR ll, DAD'S
MERCHANT MARINES SUPPLY SHIP
WAS TORPEDOED BY THE GERMANS
IN THE INDIAN OCEAN.
HE SPENT TEN DAYS
IN A LIFE BOAT
STRUGGLING WITH 20 OTHER
MERCHANT SEAMEN TO STAY ALIVE.
CERTAINLY, THE WHOLE WAY
I DEALT WITH THE WAR EXPERIENCE
MADE ME FEEL CONFIDENT
THAT I WAS, UH,
MY OWN PERSON.
I GUESS I FELT THAT
WORKING FOR MY DAD
WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR ME.
MY DAD HAD A 16-MILLIMETER
BELL & HOWELL CAMERA
BACK WHEN
THEY WERE VERY RARE,
BUT I HAD MADE
SOME FAMILY MOVIES
AND I LIKED THAT
VERY MUCH.
UH, I THINK, IN RETROSPECT,
WHAT I LIKED ABOUT IT
IS THAT IDEA
OF BEING THERE,
BUT BEING THE OBSERVER.
UH, BEING THERE AND, UH,
NOT BEING THERE, IN A SENSE.
IN TIME,
MY DAD'S FATHER
WOULD HELP HIM
PURSUE HIS AMBITIONS
BY INVESTING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS
TO SET UP A SMALL MOVIE STUDIO
IN DES PLAINES, ILLINOIS.
I MADE THIS FILM CALLED
HALF CENTURY WITH COTTON,
AND I WENT DOWN THERE
LIKE A DOCUMENTARIAN,
AND I SHOT FOOTAGE
OF THIS COTTON-MILL TOWN
WHERE THE COMPANY OWNED
THE HOUSES THAT PEOPLE LIVED IN.
PEACE, COMFORT, SECURITY.
THESE ARE TRADITIONAL WITH
OPELIKA MILLS WORKERS.
WHEN I BROUGHT THE FILM
FOR HERBIE SNOWER TO SEE--
THE HEAD OF THE COMPANY--
HE SAID, "WHAT IS ALL THIS SHIT
ABOUT THE KIDS GOING TO SCHOOL?
I WANT TO SEE
MY CARDING MACHINES.
I HAVE 30 CARDING MACHINES,
AND THEY COST $8,500 A PIECE.
IT'S ABOUT MY COTTON MILL".
SO I HAD TO GO BACK DOWN
TO OPELIKA, ALABAMA,
WITH A FULL UNION CREW,
BECAUSE I NEEDED
TO USE BIG LIGHTS
TO LIGHT UP HUGE INTERIORS
OF THE FACTORY
TO MAKE THESE LOOSE SHOTS
WHICH ATE INTO
WHATEVER PROFIT
I WOULD EVER HAVE MADE
ON THAT FILM,
BUT I WAS OBLIGED
TO DO THAT.
HIS FATHER HAD INVESTED
CLOSE TO A MILLION DOLLARS IN HIM.
AND HASKELL TOLD ME
WHAT HIS FATHER SAID TO HIM.
HE SAYS, "YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE A MAGICIAN.
YOU CAN TAKE GOOD MONEY
AND TURN IT INTO SHIT".
THAT HIT ME VERY HARD.
I MEAN, THAT WAS A STATEMENT
FOR SOMEBODY TO MAKE
ABOUT THE FATHER
SAYING IT.
BUT IT WAS
JUST A FACT--
HE DIDN'T MAKE IT
IN CHICAGO.
THAT LESS-THAN-FAVORABLE
COMMENT FROM HIS FATHER
DIDN'T HAMPER MY DAD'S
FILMMAKING PURSUITS.
HE GAVE UP HIS STUDIO
AND WENT TO WORK
AS A FREELANCE CAMERAMAN,
A GUN FOR HIRE,
AND OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS
SHOT SPORTS,
EDUCATIONAL FILMS
AND SHORT SUBJECTS,
TWO OF WHICH WERE NOMINATED
FOR ACADEMY AWARDS.
MY FAVORITE WAS A SHORT FILM
HE PHOTOGRAPHED FOR
LEWIS CLYDE STALLMAN
ABOUT A TUMBLEWEED'S JOURNEY
THROUGH THE DESERT.
SO MANY OF THESE DOCUMENTARIES
ARE DRY AND DIDACTIC.
THIS FILM WAS WITTY
AND WHIMSICAL, FOR A CHANGE.
BY NOW, HE WAS DEVELOPING A SOLID
REPUTATION AS A CINEMATOGRAPHER,
AND SOON, HOLLYWOOD DIRECTORS
CAME KNOCKING.
HE WOULD EVENTUALLY WIN
TWO ACADEMY AWARDS--
ONE FOR WHO'S AFRAID
OF VIRGINIA WOOLF IN 1966
AND THE OTHER FOR
BOUND FOR GLORY IN 1976.
♪ MAY BE THE LAST TIME
WE MARCH IN WASHINGTON ♪
♪ MAY BE THE LAST
TIME BUT I DON'T KNOW ♪
BUT BACK IN THE EARLY '60s
HE WAS FOLLOWING
HIS FIRST LOVE, DOCUMENTARIES.
OVERTLY POLITICAL IN NATURE,
HIS FILM THE BUS,
ABOUT THE 1963 CIVIL RIGHTS
MARCH ON WASHINGTON,
WOULD SET A LEFT-WING
ACTIVIST COURSE
THAT HE WOULD PURSUE RELENTLESSLY.
IT ALSO ESTABLISHED
HIM AS A PIONEER
OF A NEW STYLE OF DOCUMENTARY
CALLED CINEMA VERITE.
THIS IS THE THING.
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS
THE ETHIC OF THE WHOLE THING.
YOU ARE WILLING TO GET OFF
OF THIS BUS ANYTIME-- YOU KNOW
THAT YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO BE BOTHERED.
NO ONE'S GONNA CALL YOU DOWN
"NIGGER-LOVER" OR "NIGGER".
YOU-- LET ME FINISH!
LET ME FINISH!
CINEMA VERITE-- OR WE PREFER
THE TERM "DIRECT CINEMA"--
IT HAS TO BE TRUTHFUL
IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE
A DOCUMENTARY,
IN MY BELIEF.
AND UNFORTUNATELY, SO MANY
PEOPLE MAKING DOCUMENTARIES
DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF CONFIDENCE
THAT THEY CAN GET TO THE TRUTH.
AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT,
I THINK,
IS THAT YOU REALLY LIKE
THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE FILMING,
THAT YOU EMPATHIZE WITH THEM,
THAT AS YOU LOOK AT THEM,
EVEN ESPECIALLY THE FIRST
MOMENT YOU MEET SOMEBODY,
THAT PERSON LOOKS BACK
AT YOU AND SAYS TO THEMSELVES,
"I CAN TRUST THIS GUY".
- HEY, MARK?
- YEAH?
YOU WANT TO GO
TO BREAKFAST WITH ME?
WE'RE GOING TO WALK
DOWN TO PEABODY'S,
AND YOU'LL SEE SOMETHING
OF THE SEMI-RURAL, SUBURBAN,
RICH-PEOPLE'S LIFE
OF MONTECITO, AND ON THE WAY,
WE'LL SEE IF WE CAN GET
SOMETHING USEFUL.
UH, NOW,
I'M GOING OUT THE DOOR.
I CAN SUGGEST
THAT YOU CUT NOW.
I THINK THAT YOU'LL
FIND OUT A LOT ABOUT
FATHER-AND-SON
RELATIONSHIPS
IF YOU'RE DOING
SOMETHING TOGETHER.
SO FAR, YOU'VE BEEN
REALLY DELICATE
ABOUT ISSUES,
YOU KNOW?
I MEAN, SOMETIMES THEY USE THE
WORD "ISSUES" MEANING "FATHER"--
YOU KNOW,
"HE IS THE ISSUE OF SUCH--
OF THIS MOTHER
AND THIS FATHER".
BUT AS FAR AS
THE ISSUES AND THE IDEAS,
WE HAVEN'T GONE INTO THAT
MUCH YET, HAVE WE?
UH, NO.
OKAY.
THE ROAD'S CLEAR.
I HEARD OPRAH
MOVED HERE TO MONTECITO.
UH, YEAH.
OPRAH'S HERE.
I HOPE IT DOESN'T, UH,
RUIN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.
- HI.
- HELLO. THERE'S TWO.
WAIT A SECOND.
HEY, MARK, YOU WANT TO--
- HEY, JOE! HEY, LISTEN.
- HI, GUYS.
UH, I WANT YOU
TO MEET MY SON MARK-- MARKO.
- THIS IS JOE.
- HI. HOW ARE YOU?
NICE TO MEET YOU.
WHAT THIS IS IS EGG WHITES
WITH VEGETABLES AND TOMATOES.
THIS IS NOT ON THE MENU.
THIS IS WHAT HE MAKES UP FOR ME.
YOU MAKING THIS FILM--
IT CAN BE
A USEFUL PROCESS FOR US,
AND IT'S A WEIRD WAY
TO GO THROUGH
A PROCESS, THROUGH A--
THROUGH A MACHINE,
UM, BUT, UH,
ITS A WAY-- IN A WAY
HAS WORKED FOR YOU.
WHEN YOU MADE
THE MATCHMAKER FILM,
UH, YOU WERE GOING
THROUGH A PROCESS.
THE FACT THAT IT TURNED OUT
TO BE A GOOD FILM WAS A PLUS.
HE'S REFERRING TO
A DOCUMENTARY I MADE IN 1996
ABOUT A JEWISH MATCHMAKER AND
HOW SHE COMPLICATED MY DATING LIFE
WHEN I WAS LIVING
IN CHICAGO.
MOST OF OUR PROBLEMS
START AS OUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH OUR PARENTS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK, MARK?
DID YOUR MOTHER REJECT YOU?
MY FATHER REJECTED MY MOTHER,
AND MY MOTHER THINKS
THAT ALL MEN ARE BEASTS,
AND I DON'T WANT TO BE A BEAST.
I GUESS WHAT I MEANT BY THAT IS,
I DON'T WANT
TO BE MY FATHER.
EVEN WHEN I WAS A CHILD,
I SUSPECTED HE HAD AFFAIRS,
THOUGH HE'D VEHEMENTLY
DENY IT, CALLING ME CRAZY
FOR EVEN SUGGESTING
SUCH A THING.
OH, AND HERE'S ONE
OF YOUR FATHER.
MY MOTHER IS AN ARTIST
IN HER OWN RIGHT... -CAN YOU SEE IT?
...A PAINTER. I THINK
THAT'S WHAT ATTRACTED MY DAD
TO HER
FROM THE BEGINNING.
THAT AND THE FACT THAT SHE CAME
FROM A WORKING-CLASS BACKGROUND
AND WASN'T A CHILD
OF PRIVILEGE LIKE HIM.
MY MOM IS VERY DOWN-TO-EARTH,
AND THE WHOLE HOLLYWOOD SCENE
NEVER IMPRESSED HER MUCH.
MY DAD WOULD OFTEN GO AWAY
ON LOCATION WITH A FILM CREW.
MY MOM NEVER COMPLAINED
ABOUT IT, BUT I GOT THE SENSE
THAT SHE KIND OF
RESENTED IT.
STILL, IT DID GIVE HER TIME
ALONE TO FOCUS ON HER OWN WORK.
ULTIMATELY, I GUESS,
THEY LIVED VERY SEPARATE LIVES.
AFTER 30 YEARS OF MARRIAGE,
THEY FINALLY SPLIT UP.
- DAD!
- YES, MARKO.
DUELING CAMERAS.
OH, IT'S COMPACT.
- DO YOU LIKE THAT?
- LOOKS GOOD. YEAH.
GOD!
IT LOOKS REALLY GOOD!
SEE THAT?
DAD, I'VE GOT A SORT OF BELATED
BIRTHDAY PRESENT FOR YOU.
IT'S IN THE CAR. CAN YOU COME
WITH ME? I WANT TO GIVE IT TO YOU.
DON'T DIRECT ME.
JUST DO IT. I'LL-- I'LL--
YOU'D BE SURPRISED.
I MEANT TO, UH, GIVE THIS
TO YOU ON YOUR BIRTHDAY, BUT--
THERE IS A CERTAIN MAGIC
TO, UH, FILM.
AND WE'RE THE MAGICIANS,
THE CAMERAMEN.
NOW, UM, EVERYBODY
CAN LOOK AT IT
AND EVERYONE CAN FEEL LIKE,
"WHAT THE HELL, I CAN DO THAT".
THE MAGICIAN IS PART
OF THE CHEMISTRY,
AND THE CHEMISTRY IS-IS GONE,
PRETTY MUCH,
WHEN YOU GET INTO VIDEO.
OKAY. SO HERE WE GO.
GO AHEAD.
I MADE A PRETTY GOOD CHANGE
IN THE LIGHT LEVEL.
IT'S A LITTLE PICTURE FOR YOUR WALL.
OH, YEAH. WELL--
- IT'S ME AND--
- OH, YOU AND GEORGE BUSH.
UH-HUH.
THAT PHOTO OF ME AND GEORGE
BUSH WAS TAKEN TWO YEARS AGO
WHEN I PRODUCED
A DOCUMENTARY FOR
NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC
ON AIR FORCE ONE.
WHILE MAKING THAT FILM,
I GOT TO SPEND TIME WITH
THREE U.S. EX-PRESIDENTS
AND FLY IN THE AIRCRAFT
WITH THEN-PRESIDENT BILL CLINTON.
IT WAS AN EXPERIENCE
I'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER.
IT ONLY SAYS ONE THING TO ME.
IT SAYS THAT "I'M MARK
AND I'M DIFFERENT FROM YOU".
AND I HAVE TO SAY TO MYSELF
RATHER THAN GETTING PISSED AT YOU
THAT THAT'S FINE, MARK.
YOU CAN BE MARK.
I GET THE SAME ENJOYMENT WHEN THE
CAPTAIN FROM THE AIR FORCE ONE
CALLS YOU
ON THE COMPUTER.
I-I SHARE THAT WITH YOU.
I THINK IT'S GREAT.
AND I DON'T THINK
I'M ANY LESS A LEFTIST
FOR FEELING HAPPY
ABOUT SUCH A SITUATION.
IS THIS BEDSIDE READING?
THIS IS MY
BEDSIDE READING.
"WHEN CORPORATIONS
RULE THE WORLD".
- YEAH.
- WOW.
TERRIFIC BOOK.
THAT SOUNDS
REALLY ROMANTIC.
UM-- OH, IT IS.
YEAH.
BECAUSE IT SHOWS HOW
CORPORATIONS FUCK PEOPLE.
WELL, YOU KNOW,
HASKELL'S POLITICAL AGENDA
HAS ALWAYS BEEN VERY
IN THE FOREFRONT OF THINGS.
AND THAT HAS MADE HIM
A VERY COLORFUL INDIVIDUAL.
AND A LOT OF THE RUN-INS
I THINK HE'S HAD
UH, HAVE CENTERED AROUND
THAT PARTICULAR ASPECT.
I WAS A BIG FAN
OF HASKELL AS A PERSON
AND AS A FILMMAKER.
AND I REALLY WANTED US
TO MAKE A PICTURE WITH HIM.
THE EVENTS OF THE LATE '60s
WERE SO INTERESTING
THAT IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL
TO BE IN TOUCH WITH FILMMAKERS
WHO WEREN'T INTENT ON
PROPAGATING HOLLYWOOD MYTHS
BUT WERE ACTUALLY
INTERESTED IN MAKING
PICTURES ABOUT THE REAL WORLD.
EVERYTHING'S BEEN CLAMPED DOWN
AND HISTORY'S BEEN CHANGED
AND REWRITTEN SINCE '68,
SO WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE--
WE WERE DISCUSSING
DIFFERENT PROPERTIES
THAT HE MIGHT
UNDERTAKE,
AND THERE WAS A BOOK
CALLED THE CONCRETE WILDERNESS
THAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE
AN ARRESTING MOVIE.
AND IT SEEMED LIKE WE WERE
ABOUT TO MAKE THAT MOVIE.
TO PUT IT IN
CLASSIC HOLLYWOOD TALK,
WE GAVE HIM
A DEVELOPMENT DEAL,
AND BEING AN ANARCHIST
BY NATURE,
HE DERAILED IT AND CAME UP
WITH A BETTER IDEA.
MEDIUM COOL HAS MANY THEMES.
THE MAIN THEME HAD TO DO
WITH CONSCIENCE,
BECAUSE IT RAISED
MORAL ISSUES--
ISSUES OF RELATIONSHIP
TO THE MEDIA;
THOUGHTS ABOUT WHEN
YOU PUT THE CAMERA DOWN
AND-AND-AND
BECOME A PARTICIPANT
OR WHEN YOU SHOULD
BE A VIEWER.
I'M VERY PROUD
OF THE FILM.
I'M VERY PROUD
OF THE FILM.
WHEN DID YOU SEE MEDIUM COOL?
I'VE NEVER SEEN MEDIUM COOL,
BUT I COLLECT MOVIE MEMORABILIA
SO I KNEW WHEN I SPOTTED THIS
AT A TRADE SHOW
THAT IT WAS KIND OF A RARE FILM
TO GET A POSTER ON,
SO I SCOOPED IT RIGHT UP.
THE MIXTURE OF FICTION
AND SO-CALLED REALITY
IS INHERENT IN MEDIUM COOL.
I THOUGHT MEDIUM COOL
WAS ONE OF THE MORE
ACCURATE WAYS TO LOOK AT
THAT SUMMER IN CHICAGO
WITH THE CLOUDS OF PROTEST AND
GATHERING IN THE BACKGROUND
AS THESE PEOPLE
IN THE FOREGROUND
YOU KNOW, TRIED TO
LEAD THEIR LIVES.
FUCK YOU!
IT'S A DOCUMENTARY FILM,
AND YET IT IS NOT.
IT IS DOCUMENTARY,
AND YET THERE ARE
A FEW ACTORS IN IT KEEPING IT GOING.
THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT
WHEN YOU'RE NOT YOURSELF,
WHEN YOU'RE ANOTHER PERSON
AND THERE ARE CAMERAS AROUND.
EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW WHAT IS
IN THE BACKGROUND IS REAL,
THE SITUATION
THAT YOU'RE IN IS MAKE-BELIEVE.
AND SO YOU HAVE A FALSE
SENSE OF SECURITY.
THERE WAS ONE SCENE
WHEN HASKELL WANTED ME
TO GO UP TO
A POLICE OFFICER
AND ASK HIM FOR HELP
TO FIND MY-MY CHILD.
AND WE WANTED TO SEE
HOW I WOULD BE TREATED.
SIG HEIL! SIG HEIL! SIG HEIL!
NO MORE WAR!
ACTUALLY, IT WAS
A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING,
BECAUSE HE DIDN'T DO
ANYTHING TO ME
FOR ME TO REACT OFF OF.
JOIN US! JOIN US!
FIRST OF ALL, THE RIOTS
WERE WRITTEN INTO THE SCRIPT
BEFORE THEY EVER HAPPENED.
I WAS PART OF THE ANTI-WAR MOVEMENT,
AND I KNEW THE ANTI-WAR
MOVEMENT WAS PLANNING
TO BE IN CHICAGO
AT THAT TIME.
SO I INCORPORATED THAT
IN THE SCRIPT.
AND THEN COMES
THE BIG ONE.
WHEN WE HEAR A VOICE,
ONE OF HASKELL'S COLLEAGUES,
THE CO-PRODUCER, JONATHAN HAZE.
LOOK OUT, HASKELL! IT'S REAL!
AND HASKELL GETS THE TEAR GAS.
HE'S IN IT,
DON'T YOU SEE?
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!
DURING THE, UH,
WHAT THE GOVERNMENT
LATER CALLED
A POLICE RIOT,
I WAS ACCUSED BY THE F.B.I.
OF STARTING DISTURBANCES AND RIOTS
FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE FEATURE
FILM, 'CAUSE THE FILM WAS--
I WISHED I HAD
THAT POWER.
...RUNNING IN ALL DIRECTIONS
AND PLENTY OF THINGS
ARE BEING THROWN.
THEN THE LAST SHOT, WHERE YOU SEE
THE CAMERAMAN'S CAR
BURNING
AND A LITTLE TOURIST CAR
GOES BY WITH A KID
WITH A FLASH CAMERA,
AND THEY TAKE A PICTURE.
RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE ENTIRE
NATION THIS IS HAPPENING.
THEN THE CAMERA PULLS BACK
AND PANS OVER TO ME
ON MY CAMERA.
...SEEING THESE PEOPLE BEING
DRAGGED INTO THE POLICE WAGON.
WHAT I WAS TRYING
TO SAY IS THAT
EVERYBODY IS
IN SOMEBODY'S MOVIE.
BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY,
THERE'S ANOTHER LEVEL
OF REALITY GOING ON.
AND SO WHAT I WAS SAYING,
IN A SENSE, IS,
DON'T NECESSARILY
BELIEVE ME.
CERTAINLY WHEN THE CAMERA'S
POINTING AT US,
I DON'T CARE HOW NORMAL
YOU TRY TO BE,
WE TRY TO PRESENT OURSELVES
IN A CERTAIN WAY.
DOES THAT MEAN
YOU'RE TRYING TO
PRESENT YOURSELF IN A CERTAIN WAY?
I'M DEFINITELY TRYING TO
PRESENT MYSELF IN A CERTAIN WAY.
IT'S PART OF
THE SOCIALIZING PROCESS.
IT'S PART OF, UH--
PART OF LIFE.
SO YOU'RE--
YOU'RE ACTING TOO?
ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY.
SO WHEN ARE PEOPLE
NOT ACTING?
IT'S HARD FOR A PERSON
WHO ISN'T AN ACTOR BY PROFESSION,
YOU KNOW,
TO KEEP PERFORMING AS AN ACTOR.
AND, UH, THERE WILL BE
MOMENTS, MANY OF THEM,
WHERE HE WILL AUTOMATICALLY
PUT DOWN THAT ROLE
AND, UH--
AND JUST BE HIMSELF.
ARE YOU GOING TO TALK TO CONRAD?
I'M INTERVIEWING HIM ON TUESDAY.
TAKE THIS WITH.
I LIKE THE PICTURE.
SO CAN YOU
TELL ME ANY-- ANY--
WHAT KINDS OF THINGS
SHOULD I ASK CONRAD?
ANY STORIES?
ASK HIM ABOUT
THE WEXLER-HALL DAYS, I THINK.
YOUR FATHER AND I
HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER
EVER SINCE, UH,
THE EARLY '50s.
HASKELL AND I STARTED
A COMPANY IN 1976,
WHICH WE NAMED WEXLER-HALL
TO BE ABLE TO EARN MONEY
MAKING COMMERCIALS.
IT'S MILLER TIME.
THE WAY I FIGURED IT OUT IS THAT
THE CORPORATIONS ARE
TAKING IT AWAY FROM YOU, YOU KNOW.
AND THIS IS A WAY OF
TAKING IT BACK FROM THEM.
HASKELL IS THE FIGHTER BETWEEN
THE TWO OF US, AND I'M THE LOVER.
I'M NOT CONFRONTATIONAL.
I'M SOMEBODY THAT
DOESN'T TAKE ARMS
AGAINST A SEA OF TROUBLE THAT WAY.
I REMEMBER HASKELL WAS VERY
POLITICAL IN THOSE DAYS,
AND MY FATHER WASN'T
AND HAS NEVER BEEN VERY POLITICAL.
YOU KNOW, I LOVE
THE IDEA OF THIS
KIND OF MARRIAGE
BETWEEN OUR DADS.
I ALWAYS FELT FROM YOUR DAD
GROWING UP THIS WARMTH
AND THIS KINDNESS AND THIS HUMOR--
LIGHTNESS THAT MY DAD DIDN'T
REALLY HAVE OR DIDN'T SHOW ME.
IT WAS ALWAYS SUCH
A RELIEF TO BE AROUND HIM
'CAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS SO--
EVEN WEXLER-HALL, I'D COME IN
AND HE WAS SO WELCOMING
AND CHATTING AND--
YOU KNOW, JUST--
HE SAW THINGS AS, YOU KNOW,
THEY JUST KIND OF
FLEW OVER HIM,
AND MY DAD WAS, LIKE,
ALWAYS UP AGAINST SOMEBODY
AND, LIKE, FIGHTING--
ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE
ALWAYS ADMIRED ABOUT HASKELL
IS HE GETS UP
EVERY SINGLE MORNING
AND HE RANTS AGAINST
THE INJUSTICE IN THE WORLD.
THE VATICAN JOURNAL SAID THAT
THE U.S. JUSTIFICATION
FOR THE WAR
HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH WHAT THEY SAY IT IS.
IT HAS TO DO WITH ECONOMICS.
IT HAS TO DO WITH OIL.
I ADMIRE THAT BECAUSE
IT MEANS THAT YOU'RE
NOT COMPLACENT.
AND EVEN THOUGH AT 80 YEARS OLD
YOU'VE SEEN EVERYTHING
AND YOU SEE IT OVER
AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN,
HE NEVER STOPS RANTING.
DAD, I WANT TO ASK ONE--
MAKE ONE SUGGESTION.
WHAT?
THE TWO OF US DON'T TALK
ANY POLITICS DURING THE TRIP.
NO. IF YOU'RE MAKING
A DOCUMENTARY
WHERE I'M
THE MAIN CHARACTER,
YOU'D BETTER BE SURE
THAT I'M GONNA TALK POLITICS
BECAUSE, UM, AFTER ALL,
YOU KNOW, WE ARE GOING TO
AN ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATION,
WHICH COULD INDEED
MAKE ME SUSPECT ABOUT
WHAT THIS
DOCUMENTARY'S ABOUT.
AM I GONNA BE GOING
TO AN ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATION
TO BE MADE FUN OF?
NO. YOU CAN TELL ME.
I JUST MAY NOT REACT, BECAUSE--
NO, I DON'T WANT YOUR--
YOU DON'T HAVE TO REACT.
I MEAN,
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS,
YOU WANT TO BE
THE JOURNALIST.
I ASSUME THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING. THAT YOU WANT TO JUST, UM,
OBSERVE.
I HAVEN'T BEEN
TO A PEACE DEMONSTRATION
WITH MY DAD SINCE 1967.
AT 10 YEARS OLD, I HARDLY
CONSIDERED MYSELF
PART OF A PROTEST MOVEMENT.
NONETHELESS,
MY FATHER INSISTED
THAT I BE THE ONE
TO CARRY THE SIGN.
YOU WILL NOTICE THAT
WE USED MY CREDIT CARD
TO PAY FOR THIS GAS
AS MY CONTRIBUTION,
UH, TOWARDS THIS TRIP
TO SAN FRANCISCO.
HEY LOOK AT-- LOOK AT--
GET SOME WILD SHOTS
OF THE SOLDIERS, MARK.
MARK? -I'VE BEEN GETTING IT.
I'VE BEEN GETTING IT.
THEY'RE ALL GOING UP
TO THE PEACE MARCH.
THERE'S YOUR SOLDIERS WHO ARE BEING
BROUGHT AROUND
FROM EVERYWHERE
TO GET READY
TO GO TO WAR
TO, UH, DEFEND, UM--
DEFEND CHEVRON,
WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW.
I JUST KNOW IN
THE PAST IF WE'VE ENGAGED
IN POLITICAL DISCUSSIONS,
IT USUALLY ENDS IN
YOU TELLING ME I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HISTORY,
AND THEN THAT'S IT.
SO I'D RATHER NOT
GET INTO IT.
I WANT YOU,
AS A DOCUMENTARIAN,
EVEN THOUGH
YOU ARE MY SON,
TO REFLECT...
WHAT I BELIEVE
AND WHAT I SAY.
NOW, YOU CAN MAKE
YOUR COMMENTS ON 'EM,
BUT TO, UM--
TO GO IN AND BE THE PRIME ACTOR
IN YOUR--
IN YOUR FILM--
UH, TO SUPPLY
CERTAIN VISUAL FOOTAGE
WHICH YOU WILL THEN
ADJUST TO FIT YOUR VIEW--
IS SOMETHING I DON'T
WANT TO HAVE TO BE ON GUARD ABOUT.
THERE IT IS-- SAN FRANCISCO.
NOW, WHERE DO I GO?
I'M FUCKED.
NO, KEEP GOING.
The second exit on the right
and then right turn
onto U.S. 101 North.
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU AND ME
MARCHED AGAINST THE VIETNAM WAR--
AND I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE
TOLD YOU THIS BEFORE-- ALL OF US--
ALL OF US FELT THAT
AFTER MARCHING 50, 60 TIMES,
NOBODY'S LISTENING.
THEY'RE GONNA DO
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO ANYWAY.
HE DID TELL ME, AND HE TOLD ME
OVER AND OVER AGAIN.
OUR BREAKFAST-TABLE CONVERSATION
WHEN I WAS GROWING UP
WAS ALWAYS HIS CHANCE
TO RANT AGAINST THE CRIMES
OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.
...ABOUT WHY WE SHOULD
GO TO WAR--
MY MOM AND I WEREN'T
EXACTLY THE BEST AUDIENCE.
BUT THEN, HE DIDN'T
SEEM TO NOTICE.
SO WE'LL SEE WHAT
THE DEMONSTRATION IS TODAY.
NOW, MARK, IF YOU CUT OUT
ALL THIS POLITICAL TALK
BECAUSE YOU DON'T AGREE
WITH ME, I'LL BE PISSED.
I WILL BE PISSED
FROM MY CAN OF DUST
WHICH WILL BE DUMPED
INTO THE OCEAN.
SO YOU CAN'T GET AWAY FROM ME.
IT'D BETTER BE IN,
WE NEED
A HIGH ANGLE.
IT SAYS HERE,
"THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF THESE EVENTS
ARE TELLING.
SHOWING UP THESE DAYS--
NOT JUST THE USUAL KOOKY CADRES
OF SEMI-PROFESSIONAL
PROTEST JUNKIES,
ANTI-GLOBALIZATION
CRUSADERS
AND WHACKED-OUT
CONSPIRACY THEORISTS,
BUT PROTESTERS FROM
THE SOLID MIDDLE CLASSES".
WELL, I GUESS THAT'S US--
THE SOLID MIDDLE CLASS.
YOU'RE RONNIE GILBERT?
I RECOGNIZE RONNIE GILBERT
WITH THE WOMEN IN BLACK,
THE ANTI-WAR PEOPLE.
I LOVE YOU!
AND, YOU KNOW, YOU'VE BEEN
TALKING TO ME ABOUT MUSIC
FOR THE FILM, YOU KNOW?
YOU'VE GOT THE TAPE OF THE
WEAVERS, WHICH WE PUT IN THE CAR
DRIVING DOWN HERE.
AND REMEMBER WHEN I HEARD
THAT BEAUTIFUL WOMAN'S VOICE
ON THE TAPE, I SAID,
"THAT'S RONNIE GILBERT.
THAT VOICE REALLY GETS TO YOU".
AND THERE WAS THAT
VERY WOMAN RIGHT THERE.
♪ SOMETIMES I TAKE A GREAT NOTION ♪
♪ TO JUMP INTO THE RIVER
AND DROWN ♪
IT'S A COUPLE HOURS
AFTER THE DEMONSTRATION,
AND I'M BACK IN MY ROOM.
AND MY DAD JUST CALLED ME ON THE
PHONE FROM HIS ROOM DOWN THE HALL
AND SAID HE HAD SOMETHING
VERY IMPORTANT TO TELL ME
AND TO BRING MY CAMERA.
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO
ACCEPT MY, UM--
MY SETUP...
THAT'S FINE,
BUT I DO THINK THAT, UM--
I DO THINK THAT SITTING HERE,
THE LIGHT WILL BE GOOD AT ME.
WHAT ABOUT GETTING A LITTLE
OF THE LAST BIT OF LIGHT OUTSIDE?
PARDON ME? -HOW ABOUT IF WE GET A
LITTLE OF THE LAST LIGHT OUTSIDE?
UH, WELL, THE LAST LIGHT'S GONNA
HAVE TO HIT A PART OF MY FACE, RIGHT?
LET'S JUST GO SEE
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE OUT THERE.
- OUTSIDE?
- YEAH.
OUTSIDE? LOOK. WHAT I HAVE TO SAY
IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE IMAGE,
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET
AS GOOD A SOUND OUTSIDE.
YOU'RE GONNA GET A LOT
OF BACKGROUND SOUND.
CAN I JUST SEE
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE OUTSIDE?
OKAY, IF YOU WANT THE LIGHT ON
ME, I'LL SHOW YOU WHAT TO DO.
JUST MOVE THIS CHAIR FORWARD
AND I'LL GET A LINER ON ME.
I JUST WANT TO SEE
YOU WITH THE CITY. -HERE. LOOKIT.
- I'D LIKE TO SEE THE CITY.
- MARK. MARKO.
- WHAT?
- LOOK AT THIS.
CAN WE JUST SEE
THE CITY?
I'M ASKING 'CAUSE I WANT TO SAY
SOMETHING FOR YOUR FUCKING MOVIE.
AND THE LIGHT'S
NOT ON YOUR LENS.
IF YOU SIT THERE IT'D BE BETTER,
BECAUSE IT'D BE A NICE LINER.
AND IT'S COMING AROUND,
ABOUT TO HIT THE BACK OF MY HEAD.
- DAD--
- THE REASON I CALLED YOU OVER
IS BECAUSE I WANT TO
SAY SOMETHING.
OKAY. COULD WE JUST
WALK OUTSIDE FOR A SECOND?
YOU COULD STILL SAY IT
WHEN WE COME BACK IN.
DAD, IT'S SO--
IT'S SO PRETTY OUT THERE.
JUST CAN I GET
ONE SHOT OUTSIDE?
LET ME ASK YOU THIS.
THIS IS A PERFECT EXAMPLE.
YOU'RE TELLING ME
WHAT THE FILM'S ABOUT.
NO. NO. I'M TELLING YOU
THAT I'D LIKE--
YOU'RE TELLING ME--
I'D LIKE TO SHOOT THE
BACKGROUND I WANT TO SHOOT.
- I'M BEHIND THE CAMERA.
- WAIT A SECOND. WAIT A SECOND.
IS THIS CONTENT
OR IS THIS PICTURE?
I'M SAYING TO YOU,
I WANT TO TALK TO YOUR CAMERA.
I CALLED YOU UP IN
YOUR ROOM AND SAID,
"MARK, I WANT TO
SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THIS DAY".
NOW, IF YOU CAN'T
RESPECT THAT IMMEDIATELY,
THEN I TRULY--
I TRULY PUT YOUR, UM--
I TRULY PUT WHY WE'RE MAKING
THIS FILM INTO QUESTION.
DAD, I CAME
RIGHT OVER, DIDN'T I?
I JUST WANT TO GET THE SUN
SETTING WITH YOU OUTSIDE.
BULLSHIT WITH THE SUNSET!
ISN'T THAT A FUCKING
MILLER BEER COMMERCIAL?
IT'S YOUR FATHER TALKING ABOUT
SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO HIM.
YOU WANT TO TAKE THE SUNSET?
TAKE YOUR FUCKING
CAMERA, TAKE A PICTURE OF IT
AND THEN CUT IT
IN YOUR MOVIE.
BUT I GET A LOT
OF YOU SITTING DOWN IN A ROOM.
THIS WOULD BE YOU STANDING UP
AND-- -WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE
IS THAT I, THE STAR
OF YOUR FUCKING MOVIE,
DESPERATELY WANT
TO SAY SOMETHING
ABOUT WHAT TODAY
HAS MEANT TO ME
AND WHY I WENT UP HERE
TO SAN FRANCISCO WITH YOU
TO THIS PEACE MARCH.
OKAY? NOW, IF THAT'S
NOT IMPORTANT TO YOU
OR IF THAT'S IN BALANCE
IMPORTANT TO YOU
WITH THE SHOT
OF THE FUCKING SUNSET,
THEN I MIGHT AS WELL
HANG UP MY JOCK STRAP, YOU KNOW?
EVER SINCE GETTING BACK
FROM THE PEACE MARCH,
MY DAD'S BEEN A BIT MORE RELUCTANT
TO BRING UP PERSONAL THINGS.
MAYBE OUR ARGUMENT
IN SAN FRANCISCO IS TO BLAME,
OR MAYBE HE FEELS THAT
BY MAKING THIS DOCUMENTARY,
I'M TRESPASSING
ON HIS TERRITORY.
AFTER ALL,
FOR THE LONGEST TIME,
THERE WAS ROOM FOR ONLY
ONE FILMMAKER IN OUR FAMILY.
HE'S AGREED TO BE INTERVIEWED
FOR A BIOGRAPHY ON STEVE McQUEEN,
BUT HE'S POSTPONED A NUMBER
OF ONE-ON-ONES WITH ME.
I HOPE I HAVEN'T
CAUSED HIM TO CLAM UP.
ANY PSYCHOLOGIST WILL TELL YOU
THAT THE STRONGER
OF THE TWO INSTINCTS TO DISCLOSE
OR TO KEEP A SECRET,
THE INSTINCT TO DISCLOSE--
THAT'S THE STRONGER ONE.
PEOPLE WOULD
MUCH RATHER OPEN UP.
THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES
IN GETTING CLOSE TO YOUR FATHER
THAT YOU MAY NOT
HAVE THOUGHT OF
THAT YOU SHOULD
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF.
"PERSONAL RELEASE.
TELL THEM WHO YOU ARE".
WHO IS THIS? -IT'S A
RELEASE FORM FOR YOU TO SIGN.
I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA SIGN THIS.
I CAN'T MAKE
THE MOVIE WITHOUT IT.
YEAH, BUT I'M THE SUBJECT
OF THIS GODDAMN THING.
I KNOW. THE SUBJECT IS THE MAIN
PERSON WHO'S GOT TO SIGN IT.
I'M NOT GONNA SIGN
TILL I SEE THE MOVIE.
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
I WON'T ALLOW IT. BUT--
I WON'T!
WHAT IF YOU MAKE A--
WHAT IF YOU MAKE A FILM
THAT'S-- THAT I FIND INSULTING?
YOU GOTTA
TRUST ME.
NO, I'M SORRY.
- BUT, UH--
- HERE. HERE. JUST SIGN.
RIGHT THERE.
YOUR ASSOCIATION WITH YOUR FATHER
IS ONE OF AN IMAGE
FROM CHILDHOOD UP
OF WHO YOUR FATHER--
HE'S YOUR FATHER.
HE'S NOT A PERSON.
HE PROBABLY KNOWS IT ALL AND--
I MEAN, YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT A CHILD GROWING UP.
YOU BRING TO FATHERHOOD
WHO YOU ARE.
IF YOU'RE COMPLEX,
THERE'LL BE SOME COMPLEXITY
IN YOUR "FATHERHOOD-NESS".
YOU WILL BE VERY COMPASSIONATE
WITH YOUR CHILDREN.
YOU'LL BE TOO STRICT
SOMETIMES
AND NOT STRICT ENOUGH
AT OTHER TIMES.
IT'S A DIMENSIONAL THING.
WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY OURSELVES.
I THINK THAT'S THE
REAL PURPOSE OF EGO.
BECAUSE IF I CANNOT
IDENTIFY MYSELF,
IN MY OWN TERMS,
THEN I'M FORCED TO ACCEPT
YOUR IDENTIFYING ME.
DAD, I HAVE SOMETHING--
SOME NEWS TO TELL YOU.
YOU KNOW HOW I DID AIR FORCE
ONE FOR NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC
- FOR TELEVISION?
- YES.
THE WHITE HOUSE HAS JUST APPROVED
ME TO FLY WITH PRESIDENT BUSH
FOR SMITHSONIAN MAGAZINE TO DO
A STILL STORY OF AIR FORCE ONE.
OH, HOW GREAT. -SO I'M GONNA BE
FLYING WITH OUR PRESIDENT.
OH, GREAT.
SO WHEN THE TERRORISTS START
BOMBING THINGS AND SO FORTH,
AT LEAST YOU'LL BE PROBABLY
THE SAFEST PLACE IN THE WORLD,
BECAUSE YOU CAN BE SURE
THAT THEY'RE GONNA, UH,
MAKE SURE THAT OUR, UM,
UNELECTED PRESIDENT IS SAFE, SO--
ALTHOUGH I NEVER INTENDED TO
FOLLOW IN MY FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS,
I TOO PICKED UP A CAMERA
AT AN EARLY AGE.
IT ALLOWED ME TO SEE THE WORLD
BUT BE SHIELDED FROM IT
THROUGH THE LENS.
TO GET OUT OF WRITING
RESEARCH PAPERS IN HIGH SCHOOL,
I WOULD OFTEN
CONVINCE MY TEACHERS
TO ALLOW ME TO HAND IN
PHOTO ASSIGNMENTS.
I EVENTUALLY BECAME
A PHOTOJOURNALIST,
AND EVEN THOUGH MY FATHER
AND I USED CAMERAS FOR A LIVING,
I STILL THOUGHT OF OUR
PROFESSIONS AS DIFFERENT ENOUGH.
MY FATHER ALWAYS PRESENTED
HIMSELF AS THE ULTIMATE AUTHORITY.
BUT WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT
THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT
WAS ACTUALLY MIGHTIER
THAN HASKELL WEXLER, I EMBRACED IT.
IT'S HARD TO SAY WHETHER
I INITIALLY DID THIS
TO SEPARATE MYSELF FROM HIM
OR BECAUSE I REALLY FAVORED
THE OPPOSING SIDE.
WHEN I KNEW YOU, YOU WERE
A TEENAGER IN HIGH SCHOOL,
AND YOU WERE RIDING
AROUND IN COP CARS
WITH GREAT RESPECT FOR THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE F.B.I.,
ALL OF YOUR FATHER'S
ENEMIES.
I THINK YOU THOUGHT I WAS
SPYING ON YOU FOR THE F.B.I.
YOU PROBABLY WOULD'VE
IF THEY'D OFFERED YOU THE JOB.
THIS, TO HIM,
WAS TERRIBLY PAINFUL--
THAT NOT ONLY
WERE YOU, UH,
ADOPTING A POLITICAL POSITION
QUITE CONTRARY TO HIS,
BUT THAT HE WASN'T ABLE
TO COMMUNICATE HIS
OWN VALUES TO YOU.
HE WAS ALWAYS ASKING ME,
"CAN YOU THINK OF
SOMETHING TO CONVINCE MARK?"
AND I SAID TO HIM, "LOOK, THIS
IS NOT AN INTELLECTUAL PROBLEM.
MARK HAS HIS OWN IDEAS,
AND I DON'T THINK ANYTHING I SAY
OR ANY DOCUMENT I SHOW HIM
IS GOING TO SWAY HIM".
SO, DAD,
WHERE ARE WE HERE?
MARK, I WANTED
TO TELL YOU THAT WE'RE GOING IN
TO DO A LITTLE
PHOTO SHOW--
PART OF A DOCUMENTARY--
AT STANLEY SCHEINBAUM'S HOUSE.
BUT, DAD,
THIS IS A MEETING
THAT IS AGAINST THINGS
THAT THE GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO DO
VIS-A-VIS CUBA.
I HAVE TO BE CLEARED AGAIN
TO GO OFF WITH PRESIDENT BUSH
ON THE AIRPLANE,
AND IF THERE'S A PROBLEM,
IT COULD BE BECAUSE OF THIS.
I DON'T WANT
TO BE LINKED.
- WAIT, WAIT.
- I DON'T WANT TO BE LINKED.
IN OTHER WORDS, YOU DON'T WANT TO
TAKE YOUR CAMERA INTO ANY PLACE
WHICH YOU THINK THAT IF GEORGE
W. BUSH SAW YOU DO THAT,
HE WOULD NOT
GIVE YOU CLEARANCE.
AND I'M SAYING,
THAT IS PERVERSION.
THAT IS
ADOLF HITLER TALK.
I'M JUST SAYING,
I'D LIKE TO
PLAY IT SAFE.
I-I DON'T WANT TO BRING SAUL
INTO THIS. I-I REALLY DON'T.
I DO. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.
SHOOT THE SCENE!
YOU GOT A SCENE
INSTEAD OF A TALKING HEAD.
WELL, I THINK IT'S PROBABLY
SAFER FOR YOU NOT TO GO IN, MARK.
SO YOU THINK MY CONCERNS
ARE LEGITIMATE?
TOTALLY. I THINK
YOU'RE VERY PERCEPTIVE
IN THAT WE ARE
IN A PLACE NOW WHERE
SECURITY CONCERNS
HAVE BECOME DOMINANT.
AND THEY'VE CERTAINLY--
HOW SHOULD I SAY IT?
--TAKEN THE--
THE HIGH ROAD,
UH, OVER, LET'S SAY,
WHAT WE USED TO THINK OF
AS TRADITIONAL RIGHTS
AND LIBERTIES.
I TURNED THIS OFF.
- TURN THAT BACK ON.
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?
SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO? -LOOKIT.
IT'S NOT "WHAT SHOULD WE DO?"
I KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO.
I'M GOING IN THERE
AND FIND OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON.
MAYBE LEARN SOMETHING
AND USE MY CAMERA TO, UH--
IF I LEARN SOMETHING, OTHER
PEOPLE CAN LOOK WHAT I'VE SHOT,
AND THEN THEY'LL
LEARN SOMETHING.
THAT'S WHAT AMERICA'S
ALL ABOUT.
NOW, WHAT NAZI GERMANY
WAS ALL ABOUT,
I CAN'T TELL YOU.
I THOUGHT I GAVE HIM
PRETTY GOOD ADVICE.
HIS WHOLE FIGHT IN LIFE
IS TO SAY HE'S MORE IMPORTANT
THAN ME, UNDERSTAND?
- UH-HUH.
THIS IS THE BACK LOT.
AND-AND-AND
TO BE ABLE TO SAY
THAT THE CAPTAIN OF AIR FORCE
ONE CALLS HIM UP, SAYING,
"COME ON, FLY ON AIR FORCE ONE
AGAIN WITH BUSH" AND SO FORTH.
BECAUSE HE NEEDS-- HE NEEDS TO SAY
HE'S AS IMPORTANT AS ME. MORE SO.
AND WITH
THE OFFICIAL STAMP.
A FEW MORE TIMES.
SO HOW'S HE DOING FOR 80?
HOW'S HE DOING FOR 80?
HE'S DOING GREAT FOR 60.
FOR 80, HE'S DOING SUPER!
GOOD JOB. THE WHOLE SCIENCE IS,
MAKE 20 OUT OF TEN,
RIGHT?
IT'S LIKE MY DAD SAID--
I SHOULD BE A CHEMIST,
'CAUSE I COULD TAKE GOOD MONEY
AND CHANGE IT INTO SHIT.
HOW MANY ROUNDS WE DOING?
WE'RE DOING FIVE ROUNDS,
THREE MINUTES EACH. -FIVE?
YES!
SURPRISED?
SO, COME ON!
TOO MUCH TALK, MOVIE STAR? COME ON!
GOOD JOB, MISTER.
WHO YOU KILL TODAY?
WHO WAS YOUR
IMAGINARY OPPONENT?
AH, I WAS NOT KILLING.
I WAS IN SPORTS. SPORTS.
I WAS DEFEATING
A VERY NICE GUY
WHO, UH, HAD TO KNOW
THAT I WAS A BETTER BOXER.
HASKELL, THERE IS
NO "NICE GUY" IN BOXING.
WELL, THIS IS ONE OF VICTOR'S SONS.
HE WAS
A CHESS CHAMPION.
NOW, THIS KID'S
NOT ONLY
INTELLECTUALLY ACTIVE,
BUT HE INSISTS THEY DO
WHAT HE HAS IN MIND
AS FAR AS THEIR-THEIR--
THEIR BODIES,
SO THEY'RE GOOD
IN SPORTS AS WELL.
MAYBE I WOULD HAVE
BEEN A BETTER FATHER
IF I KNEW WHAT I KNOW NOW
WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP,
SO YOU WOULDN'T
TURN OUT TO BE SUCH A MESS.
YEAH, I'M-I'M ROLLING.
OKAY.
I GUESS
IT WAS ONLY FAIR
THAT MY FATHER ASK ME
SOME QUESTIONS.
- ALL RIGHT.
- I WAS REALLY CURIOUS
TO FIND OUT WHAT HE WANTED TO
LEARN ABOUT HIS MESSED-UP SON.
YOU'RE TALKING TO PEOPLE.
I DON'T KNOW--
I DON'T KNOW ALL THE PEOPLE
YOU'RE TALKING TO.
UH, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE ASKING, AND WHAT'S MORE,
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.
NOW, I ASSUME THAT MOST OF THEM
ARE SAYING GOOD THINGS ABOUT ME.
A GUY COMES THERE
AND HE'S MY SON.
SO, UH, THEY'RE
NOT GONNA, UH--
IN OTHER WORDS, THEY'RE
NOT GONNA DO THE INTERVIEW
IF THEY WANT TO SAY THAT
HASKELL'S A 14-CARAT PRICK
AND, UH,
WHY ARE YOU MAKING
A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT HIM?
SO THEN,
HOW MUCH OF WHAT--
OF WHAT YOU HEAR
FROM PEOPLE SAY
DO YOU FEEL IS
WHO I AM?
THIS HAS BEEN INTERESTING,
BECAUSE A LOT OF THINGS
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT YOU
OVER THE YEARS, IT'S BEEN--
SOME PEOPLE SAY, YOU KNOW--
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE--
YOU KNOW, MOST PEOPLE HAVE
GREAT RESPECT FOR YOU AND LOVE,
BUT SOME PEOPLE SAY
YOU'RE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT
AND, UH,
EXTREMELY OPINIONATED.
GROWING UP, UM,
I OFTEN FELT
THAT YOU UNDERMINED ME
IN CERTAIN WAYS.
I REMEMBER WHEN
I HAD CERTAIN, UH--
IF I WERE EXPRESSING
EMOTION OFTEN,
YOU'D SAY,
"OH, YOU'RE JUST ACTING".
AND, UM--
OR "YOU'RE STUPID, MARK".
I REMEMBER HEARING THAT
A LOT WHEN GROWING UP.
THEN I REMEMBER,
YOU KNOW,
GROWING UP AND,
AROUND THE DINNER TABLE,
YOU'D SIT AROUND AND SAY,
"OH, THAT DIRECTOR'S STUPID,
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING".
YOU KNOW WHY
THAT WAS, MARK? -WHY?
BECAUSE MOSTLY THEY WERE.
MOSTLY THEY WERE...?
STUPID.
SORRY I'M LATE, DAD.
WELL, IT'S EARLY IN THE MORNING,
AND I HAVE SORT OF A TENSE
SITUATION FOR ME PERSONALLY,
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IN A MONTH
AND A HALF I'M GONNA BE 81.
I DON'T FEEL 81.
I'VE NOT BEEN WORKING.
AND I HAVE AN INTERVIEW
WITH, UM, A DIRECTOR
WHO USED TO BE A CAMERAMAN
NAMED BILLE AUGUST.
LISTEN, I GOTTA DO STUFF
TO GET READY, SO, UH--
I JUST WONDER WHAT
HE'S GONNA THINK ABOUT ME,
ABOUT HIRING ME OR NOT.
I FEEL LIKE SAYING TO HIM,
"LOOKIT, BILLE,
YOU KNOW I CAN SHOOT.
YOU CAN TELL THAT
I'M HEALTHY AND ALERT.
YOU'RE GONNA GET ME
AT A BARGAIN PRICE
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I
WAS TOLD THE BUDGET WAS.
SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? WHAT
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW FROM ME?"
BUT I WON'T SAY THAT.
WHAT I WILL SAY IS, UH,
"VERY PLEASED
TO MEET YOU.
I KNOW YOUR WORK,
AND, UH,
I'M GLAD THAT I HAVE
THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU,
AND I WOULD LIKE
TO KNOW WHAT--"
I WON'T USE THIS TERM,
BUT WHAT CAMERAMEN SAY,
"WHAT YOUR VISION IS".
I AM YOUR
OBEDIENT SERVANT.
I NEVER KNEW MY FATHER
TO BE ANYONE'S SERVANT.
AND NO ONE KNOWS THAT BETTER
THAN THE PRODUCER OF
ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST,
MICHAEL DOUGLAS. -CUCKOO'S NEST
WAS THE WORST EXPERIENCE
OF MY ENTIRE CAREER
THAT DAY.
I THINK IT WAS
MICHAEL DOUGLAS WHO SUGGESTED
THAT I TALK TO HASKELL, AND
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED, BECAUSE I--
YOU KNOW, I THINK
HASKELL IS A BRILLIANT,
BRILLIANT CINEMATOGRAPHER.
THE ONLY RESERVATION WAS
THAT HE HAD DIRECTED BEFORE,
AND IT WAS THAT-- THAT SLIGHT
RESERVATION OF A CINEMATOGRAPHER
WHO, YOU KNOW,
MIGHT WANT TO DIRECT,
AND WOULD HE TAKE OVER?
MILOS FORMAN,
OUR DIRECTOR,
CAME FROM AN EASTERN KIND OF
EUROPEAN DISCIPLINE,
A SORT OF
AUTHORITARIAN FIGURE,
AND DID NOT ENJOY
BEING QUESTIONED,
YOU KNOW,
AND HASKELL CERTAINLY
LIKED TO QUESTION
AUTHORITY.
WELL, OUR RELATIONS
STARTED TO DETERIORATE WHEN--
WHEN I FOUND OUT
THAT HE'S SHARING HIS FRUSTRATION
WITH ACTORS,
AND THAT, OF COURSE,
MADE THE ACTORS NERVOUS.
THAT MADE
THE PRODUCERS NERVOUS.
AND FINALLY,
IT MADE ME NERVOUS, YOU KNOW.
YOUR DAD'S TOUGH.
I'LL NEVER FORGET HIS,
YOU KNOW, KIND OF CRITICAL,
KIND OF JUDGING LOOK.
KIND OF NEUTRAL.
YOU COULDN'T QUITE TELL.
IT ALWAYS REMINDED ME
OF MY DAD,
AND MY DAD HAD A VERY
KIND OF A NEUTRAL--
JUST LIKE HE WAS LOOKING
AT YOU, ANALYZING YOU,
MAKING YOU FEEL LIKE,
"JEEZ, I DON'T KNOW".
I HEAR ACTORS, YOU KNOW,
COMING AND TELLING ME,
"SO WHAT'S HAPPENING AGAIN?
HASKELL IS TELLING ME, 'MY GOD,
WHAT IS HE DOING?'" YOU KNOW?
TELLING ACTORS THAT, YOU KNOW,
NOBODY WILL BE ABLE
TO PUT THIS THING TOGETHER.
I WILL CERTAINLY NOT BE ABLE
TO TIME IT UP PERFECTLY,
AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
WHICH I'LL TELL YOU,
YOU KNOW, IT'S SORT OF SILLY,
BECAUSE WHY DOES HE COMPLAIN
TO PEOPLE WHO-- WHO I HIRED?
WHO ARE LOYAL TO ME
BECAUSE I HIRED THEM?
OF COURSE THEY WILL
COME AND TELL ME.
TO THIS DAY, BECAUSE
IT WAS MY FIRST MOVIE,
IT WAS THE HARDEST THING
I'D EVER DONE IN MY LIFE.
BECAUSE HE WAS OLD ENOUGH
TO BE MY DAD,
AND HE WAS
AN ACADEMY-AWARD WINNER,
AND JUST DIDN'T...
WORK OUT.
I REPLACED HASKELL
WEXLER ON CUCKOO'S NEST.
NOBODY SAID ANYTHING TO ME
ABOUT WHY HE WAS LET GO.
I KNOW WHY.
AS I WATCHED
HASKELL'S FOOTAGE
AS HE WENT ON
INTO THE PICTURE,
I COULD SEE IT
DETERIORATE
AND BE LESS SHARP
AND LESS INSPIRED.
AND I'VE BEEN THERE,
SO I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.
AND IT'S SIMPLY A CASE WHERE
YOU ARE TRYING VERY, VERY HARD
TO PLEASE THE DIRECTOR,
AND YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE WANTS.
IT WAS ONE OF
THE FEW TIMES IN MY LIFE
THAT I WAS...
TRULY DEVASTATED.
I WAS SAYING I FELT
LIKE COMMITTING SUICIDE.
I FELT HORRIBLE.
TO THIS DAY,
I DON'T KNOW
EXACTLY WHY I WAS FIRED.
UM, HOWEVER,
I HAD-- AND I HAVE--
SERIOUS CLUES.
ABOUT SIX MONTHS BEFORE
WE FILMED CUCKOO'S NEST,
MY FRIEND DE ANTONIO
SAID THAT
HE HAD CONTACT WITH
FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE
KNOWN AS
THE WEATHER UNDERGROUND,
AND WOULD I BE INTERESTED
IN SHOOTING THE FILM?
AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW
IF PEOPLE GO AROUND
AFRAID THAT A COP
OR SOME F.B.I. MAN
OR SOME C.I.A. MAN
IS GONNA-- IS GONNA GRAB 'EM.
I JUST WANT TO KNOW
IF YOU WALK AROUND WITH THAT FEAR.
THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE,
I COULDN'T SHOW ANY PEOPLE,
I COULDN'T SHOW ANY FACES,
I CAN'T EVEN SHOW HEADS OF HAIR.
SO I WAS OBLIGED
MOSTLY TO, UH,
USE SOME
CHEESECLOTH MATERIAL
THAT YOUR MOTHER
GAVE ME,
AND, UH,
THERE WAS A MIRROR
ON THE WALL.
AND SO I BASICALLY SHOT--
THE ONLY THING I COULD SHOOT
WAS MYSELF AND DE ANTONIO
IN THE MIRROR.
AFTER CUCKOO'S NEST
HAD WRAPPED,
THE ACCOUNTANT
ON THE FILM
SAID THAT THE F.B.I.
WAS UP IN OREGON,
AND THEY WERE QUESTIONING,
UH, SOME OF THE MAIDS,
AND THEY CAME IN
AND QUESTIONED HIM ABOUT ME.
NEVER. I NEVER HEARD
ABOUT F.B.I. COMING ON THE SET.
CERTAINLY DIDN'T
TALK TO ME.
AND NOBODY TOLD ME
THAT THEY WERE THERE.
I, UH, HAVE NO IDEA.
THE GOVERNMENT COULD HAVE
MADE TROUBLE FOR MILOS,
AND MY GUESS IS, THEY, UH--
THEY PUT THE HEAT ON MILOS
TO, UM-- UH--
TO GET RID OF ME.
NO. OF ALL THE PEOPLE
TO TELL THAT TO,
I'D BE THE ONE, BECAUSE I'VE
ALWAYS BEEN VERY SYMPATHETIC
TO HIS POLITICS.
WHY WOULD HE NOT
HAVE TOLD ME
ABOUT THE F.B.I.?
BECAUSE HE LOVED TO BE THE
VICTIM. ESPECIALLY THE VICTIM
OF THE F.B.I.,
BECAUSE WE ALL HATED THE F.B.I.
THE F.B.I. IS
A JERKY ORGANIZATION.
IT HAPPENED AGAIN
ON THE CONVERSATION
WHERE HASKELL DID NOT
GET ALONG WITH THE DIRECTOR,
AND SO THE DIRECTOR ASKED ME
TO COME IN AND SHOOT FOR HIM THEN.
AND HASKELL KNOWS THE AGENT
THAT I HAD AT THE TIME,
WHO WAS CRAYTON SMITH,
AND HE CALLED CRAYTON UP ONE
DAY-- WELL, IT'S NOT HIS AGENT--
BUT HE CALLED CRAYTON
UP ONE DAY, AND HE SAYS,
"HEY, CRAYTON. GET BUTLER READY.
I'VE GOT ANOTHER PICTURE".
SOMEONE LIKE YOUR DAD
IS ALSO A DIRECTOR--
IF DIRECTORS
LIKE YOUR DAD--
AND I'M TALKING ABOUT
SERIOUS HEAVYWEIGHTS--
SNIFF THAT THE GUY THAT
THEY'RE WORKING FOR
IS LESS COMPETENT THAN THEMSELVES--
AND THIS MAY BE
A SUBCONSCIOUS THING--
THAT'S WHEN THEY START
TO BECOME DIFFICULT.
IT'S NOT LIKE HASKELL,
YOU KNOW, DOES A PALACE COUP
AND STARTS SAYING, "NO, WE'RE NOT
GONNA SHOOT THIS SCENE TODAY.
WE'RE GONNA SHOOT THIS ONE
INSTEAD" OR ANYTHING.
HE'S JUST VERY FORCEFUL
ABOUT HIS OPINIONS.
I PRAISE HIM FOR THAT FILM.
I REALLY DIDN'T GET ALONG WITH HIM
AND DIDN'T LIKE HIM PERSONALLY,
AND HE'S THE ONLY CAMERAMAN
I'VE EVER BEEN ON BAD TERMS WITH.
I WOULD NEVER USE HIM AGAIN, BUT
HE WAS A DAMN GOOD CAMERAMAN.
HE'S A PAIN IN THE ASS
TO WORK WITH, HASKELL.
YEAH. IT'S HIS ATTEMPT,
I THINK,
TO CONTROL THE STORY.
I JUST THINK THERE WAS
A PERIOD IN HASKELL'S LIFE
WHERE THE FRUSTRATION
AS A DIRECTOR WAS IMMENSE
AND WOULD HAVE PROBABLY
BEEN BETTER SERVED
BY GOING BACK TO THOSE
DOCUMENTARIES OR
WHATEVER IT WAS AT THAT POINT.
AS A DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY,
I ALWAYS HAVE WORKED
AS IF IT'S MY FILM.
YOU'D ALMOST IN A SENSE
RATHER BE DIRECTING THE MOVIE.
OR WOULD YOU NOT?
I DON'T THINK THERE'S
A MOVIE THAT I'VE BEEN ON
THAT I WASN'T SURE
I COULD DIRECT IT BETTER.
BUT CERTAINLY ALSO,
AS A DIRECTOR
OF PHOTOGRAPHY,
I HAVE TO SERVE
THE MOVIE
IN WHATEVER WAY I CAN
AS A-- AS A
FILMMAKER.
YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE
COLOR BLIND. IS THAT TRUE?
I DON'T KNOW THE LEVEL
OF MY COLORBLINDNESS.
WHAT DO YOU SEE?
OKAY,
THIS SAYS "12".
THIS IS NO PROBLEM
AT ALL.
OH, AND IT SAYS ON THE BACK,
"EVERYONE SEES 12".
AND THE NEXT ONE?
WHAT DO YOU SEE?
I CAN'T-- I CAN'T
REALLY SEE THIS ONE.
NO, I C-- I CANNOT S--
THAT'S EIGHT.
OOH, THIS IS A BITCH.
I'LL SHOW IT TO THE AUDIENCE.
I'M NOT LOOKING AT THE BACK.
YOU DEFINITELY SEE
A NUMBER HERE.
I CAN'T SEE ANY NUMBER
HERE AT ALL.
THAT'S 16.
WELL--
IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE WHAT
MIGHT BE CALLED COLORBLINDNESS,
BECAUSE I HAVE AN ACUTE
SENSIBILITY FOR DENSITY,
FOR, UH, DIFFERENCES
IN-IN GRAY AND WHITE.
AND I THINK, ACTUALLY, MY LACK
OF TOTAL COLOR SENSITIVITY
IS A POSITIVE FACTOR
RATHER THAN A NEGATIVE FACTOR,
ALTHOUGH CERTAINLY
DURING MY LIFE AS A CAMERAMAN,
I DID NOT WANT IT
PUBLICIZED.
IN TERMS
OF MAKING FILMS
AND HOW HEAVY A HAND YOU USE
AND HOW DIRECT YOU ARE
IN TERMS OF
PUTTING FORTH YOUR AGENDA
IS-- I THINK, PROBABLY BEEN
AN ISSUE ON SOME OF HIS FILMS.
I THINK IN MEDIUM COOL
IT WAS ACTUALLY A GREAT ASSET,
AND IT'S A VERY INTERESTING
FILM AND A DOCUMENT OF THE TIMES.
AND THE OTHER FILMS,
I THINK, YOU KNOW,
IT MAY HAVE GOTTEN
IN THE WAY OF THE STORYTELLING.
WELL, HE GAVE ME A SCRIPT ONE TIME
TO BE SHOT
IN LATIN AMERICA.
TOLD HIM I DIDN'T LIKE IT.
"DON'T SHOOT IT.
IT'S TOO... OVERT,
THE MESSAGE.
IT HITS YOU OVER THE HEAD.
YOU CAN BE MUCH MORE SUBTLE".
LATINO IS WRITTEN AND DIRECTED
BY TWO-TIME OSCAR WINNER
HASKELL WEXLER.
IT IS A PRESENTATION OF GEORGE
LUCAS' COMPANY, LUCASFILM.
ITS STORY IS AS TOPICAL
AS TODAY'S HEADLINES,
AND EVERY MAJOR
STUDIO IN HOLLYWOOD
HAS REFUSED TO
DISTRIBUTE IT.
THE MAJOR STUDIOS WOULD NOT
PICK UP LATINO, IN MY OPINION,
BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED IT WOULD
JUST BE TROUBLE FOR THEM--
POLITICAL TROUBLE.
CONTROVERSY IS--
IS THE FERTILIZER OF DEMOCRACY,
AND I'M VERY MUCH IN FAVOR
OF IT, AND I'M PLEASED THAT
WE STILL HAVE ENOUGH FREEDOM
TO EXPRESS OURSELVES.
HASKELL'S GREAT
SUCCESS AS A DIRECTOR
WAS MEDIUM COOL.
HE TOOK HIS ACTORS
AND PUT THEM INTO A REALITY.
AND SO,
TAKING THAT NOTION,
LET'S PUT OUR ACTORS
INTO THE REALITY OF NICARAGUA
IN WHICH THERE'S A WAR
GOING ON BETWEEN THE CONTRAS
AND THE SANDINISTA
GOVERNMENT.
FIRST OF ALL,
I WAS TERRIFIED ON LATINO.
I REMEMBER IT BEING
A VERY DIFFICULT SHOOT.
AND WHAT WAS REALLY STRANGE
WAS THAT THE THINGS
THAT WE WERE FILMING
WERE ACTUALLY HAPPENING
IN NICARAGUA,
WHICH WAS AT THE HEIGHT
OF THE CONTRA WAR.
YOU COULD ALMOST
CALL IT GUERILLA FILMMAKING.
THERE WERE GUERILLAS THERE.
EVEN TO THE POINT WHERE,
IN A FIREFIGHT IN THE MOVIE,
THESE VERY ENTHUSIASTIC EXTRAS
STARTED TO USE LIVE AMMUNITION.
SO THIS WAS-- I MEAN,
IT GOT VERY DICEY.
BUT HE REALLY LOVED IT. I MEAN,
I THINK HE WAS IN HIS ELEMENT.
WEXLER THINKS THE WHITE HOUSE,
WHICH OPPOSES THE SANDINISTA
REGIME IN NICARAGUA
WOULD BE, QUOTE,
"ECSTATIC," END QUOTE, IF LATINO
WERE NEVER SEEN OR FLOPPED.
- MARY.
- THANK YOU, RONA.
WELL, THE REAGAN
WHITE HOUSE GOT ITS WISH.
LATINO BOMBED
AT THE BOX OFFICE.
THE STRENGTH OF
BOTH LATINO AND MEDIUM COOL
ARE THE DOCUMENTARY ELEMENTS
KIND OF MEETING
WITH THE FICTIONAL,
TRADITIONAL ELEMENTS IN THEM.
THAT'S A DIFFICULT
WAY TO SHOOT,
AND IT'S A WAY THAT MAKES
FINANCIERS NERVOUS,
BECAUSE IT'S NOT
ALL THERE ON THE PAGE.
I WISH HASKELL
HAD DIRECTED MORE MOVIES
AND HAD BEEN A LITTLE MORE
APOLITICAL FROM TIME TO TIME,
BECAUSE HE,
AS A DIRECTOR, WOULD HAVE MADE
SOME VERY ENGAGING PICTURES ABOUT
PEOPLE AND NOT JUST ABOUT CAUSES.
FOR MY FATHER,
THE CAUSE ALWAYS COMES FIRST.
THE ONE THAT HE'S CURRENTLY
INVOLVED WITH IS THE FIGHT
FOR SANER WORK HOURS
ON HOLLYWOOD FILM PRODUCTIONS.
HE'S MAKING
A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT IT.
HE'S ASKED ME TO HELP HIM
SHOOT JULIA ROBERTS,
WHO'S AGREED
TO AN INTERVIEW. I MUST CONFESS,
I GET A BIT NERVOUS
AROUND HOLLYWOOD ROYALTY.
MY FATHER,
THE OLD PRO, DOESN'T.
SO YOU THINK IT'S GONNA BE ALL
RIGHT FOR ME TO SHOOT TOMORROW?
I JUST DON'T KNOW
WHEN WE SHOULD DO IT.
I DON'T WANT YOU SHOOTING
WHEN I'M SHOOTING.
THAT'S THE HOT SEAT?
THAT'S THE HOT SEAT.
I WANT TO HAVE THE CONCENTRATION
ON THE MAIN THING.
THE MAIN THING
IS MY MOVIE.
WE DID SORT OF GET
IN EACH OTHER'S WAY AT FIRST,
BUT JULIA WAS
A GOOD SPORT ABOUT IT.
IS THERE A REASON WHY
WE HAVE AN ARTICLE ON GAS?
IT'S THE FUNNIEST THING.
IT'S MY NUTRITION MAGAZINE.
YEAH, I JUST REFUSE
TO BE GASEOUS.
IT'S UNBECOMING.
MARK, AM I PRESSING
THE WRONG BUTTONS HERE?
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S--
- STAND BY.
JULIA, WE CAME HERE
BECAUSE WE HEARD
THAT YOU HAD SOME FEELINGS
ABOUT THE LONG HOURS.
WELL, FIRST,
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT--
THE INTERVIEW WENT ALONG
SMOOTHLY. I LET DAD BE IN CHARGE,
AND I TRIED TO STAY OUT OF
THE WAY THE BEST I COULD.
...AND THEN GO HOME
WITH THIS GREAT TRIUMPH
UNDER YOUR BELT
TO TAKE HOME TO YOUR FAMILY
WHEN YOU'RE NOT COMATOSE
AND A ZOMBIE
AND YOUR KIDS HAVE ALREADY
BEEN PUT TO BED
AND YOU'RE KIND OF
MISSING EVERYTHING.
SORRY.
HE BROUGHT
A STICK TO ME.
TAKE IT OUTSIDE, LOUIE.
OUT. OUT, OUT, OUT. COME ON.
HEY, MARKO, YOU'RE ALSO
GETTING IN JULIA'S SHOT,
AND, UM--
YOU AND LOUIE ARE TRYING
TO HOG MY CAMERA TIME.
UM--
MARK, WE'RE THROUGH
WITH THE SHOOT. WE DID IT.
IT WAS P--
I THINK IT WAS PERFECT.
THAT IF YOU HAVE
MILK PRODUCTS WITH NO FOOD,
IT'S LIKELY
TO BE GAS.
BUT THEN THEY
GO INTO ODORS, AND THEY SELL--
YOU DEPORTED YOURSELF WELL,
AND YOU HELPED ME COVER
FOR MY LACK OF-- OF HEARING.
SO I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.
IT WAS REALLY GOOD.
- IT WAS FUN.
- YEAH, GOOD.
I WOKE UP THIS MORNING,
AND I THOUGHT,
"I SEE MYSELF HAVING A
CONVERSATION ABOUT GAS
ON THE FRONT PORCH THIS MORNING--
I CAN JUST SEE IT HAPPENING".
I THINK NOW
I DESERVE TO, UH, TO TAKE A REST.
'CAUSE I HEARD DANNY ASK
HOW OLD YOUR FATHER IS.
I HEARD IT
ON THE THING, SEE?
AND, UH, I DON'T KNOW
WHETHER HE WAS ASKING
TO FIND OUT WHETHER HE SHOULD
GET ME A WHEELCHAIR OR WHAT,
BUT, UH,
IN ANY EVENT--
I'M NOT SURE I HEARD
YOUR RESPONSE, MARK, BUT--
ANYWAY, FOR THIS SHOOT,
WE DID GREAT. OKAY?
WE WERE BOTH FEELING PRETTY
GOOD ABOUT OUR SHOOT WITH JULIA,
AND THERE WAS NO REAL RUSH
TO GET BACK TO LOS ANGELES,
SO I THOUGHT DAD AND I COULD SPEND
SOME TIME TOGETHER ENJOYING TAOS.
IT'S CALLED
A CIGASTO INDIAN.
MEANING
A CIGAR STORE INDIAN.
THIS IS WHAT
TOURISTS DO.
WE GOT AN AMERICAN FLAG.
OH, YEAH. YOU WANT ME TO KISS
IT FOR YOU OR SOMETHING, MARK?
YEAH, YEAH.
THIS IS AMERICA.
WATCH YOUR STEP.
SO DAD, THIS IS ONE OF THE
OLDEST MISSIONS IN NEW MEXICO.
I DID A STORY FOR
SMITHSONIAN MAGAZINE
ABOUT THE RESTORATION OF IT.
AND I SPENT, LIKE,
A WEEK HERE.
THESE ARE THE ARTIFACTS
OF THE CONQUERORS,
THE PEOPLE THAT CAME IN
UNDER THE NAME OF JESUS
AND, UH, QUOTE,
"CIVILIZED" THE INHABITANTS,
THE NATIVES
WHO WERE HERE.
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST APPRECIATE IT?
WHY DOES EVERYTHING
HAVE TO BE SO NEGATIVE?
MARK,
THIS IS NOT NEGATIVE.
THIS IS PART OF UNDERSTANDING
HISTORY AND EDUCATION.
IT'S ALSO--
BEYOND THAT,
IT'S BECAUSE YOU WANT
TO HAVE A FILM THAT, UH,
KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT
THE WAY I LOOK AT THINGS,
AND I LOOK AT THEM AS,
YES, THIS IS FINE,
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL CHURCH,
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL STATUE,
BUT IT REPRESENTS THE COLONIZATION
OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH
AND PART OF THE DESTRUCTION
OF THE INDIAN RACE.
IF WE DON'T UNDERSTAND
HISTORY, WE WILL HAVE TO
SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES
IN THE PRESENT.
I KNEW YOU WHEN YOU
WERE A SMALL CHILD,
AND THEN I KNEW YOU
AS AN OLDER CHILD.
AT THAT TIME, YOUR FATHER
WAS GOING THROUGH A DIVORCE,
AND IT MIGHT HAVE AFFECTED
YOUR RELATIONSHIP
WITH YOUR FATHER.
AND IT TAKES SOME TIME
TO GET OVER THE IDEA THAT
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE TOGETHER
IN A WONDERFUL FAMILY
ALL THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
AND ALL OF THAT KIND OF THING.
THE THING
ABOUT IT IS THAT
YOU DON'T GIVE UP
THESE FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS.
IT'S GREAT.
I REMEMBER THAT WE TOOK UP A VERY
FOND RELATIONSHIP AT THAT TIME
BECAUSE WE WERE
BOTH SORT OF...
FALSTAFFS,
I CALL IT.
WE SAW A LOT
OF HUMOR IN LIFE.
BUT I WAS GLAD
TO HAVE A SURROGATE-FATHER
RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU,
AND NOW THAT
YOU'RE GROWN UP,
UH, SO TO SPEAK,
I THINK YOU'RE TRYING
TO GET TO KNOW YOUR FATHER
IN AN EMOTIONAL WAY,
WHICH MAY NOT HAVE BEEN
ACCESSIBLE EARLIER IN YOUR LIFE.
HERE'S THE OPENING
OF THE MOVIE.
IT'S AFTER THE WEDDING,
AND, LIKE, HERE'S THIS CAR
SITTING ALL ALONE
OVER THERE,
AND, UH, YOU CAN'T SEE
THE PEOPLE INSIDE
BECAUSE OF THE REFLECTION
OF THE WHITE SKY.
AND WE MOVE IN
AND WE MOVE IN, AND, UH,
THERE'S THIS SORT OF
BABY-TALK, YOU KNOW,
KIND OF STUFF?
AND THERE YOU ARE,
FATHER AND SON.
HASKELL'S KIND OF
LIKE MY GODFATHER.
UM, I SOMEHOW FEEL
A BOND TO YOUR DAD
THAT IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER
RELATIONSHIP I HAVE WITH,
YOU KNOW--
IT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE
I FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT YOUR DAD.
IN FACT, I ALWAYS TELL KATE,
"I WISH YOUR DAD WERE MY DAD.
I WISH I HAD HIM AS A DAD".
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE--
I TOLD MY DAD,
YOU KNOW--
I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOUR
FILM. I HOPE THE FILM REALLY
DEALS WITH THINGS
BEYOND THE BUSINESS, SO TO SPEAK.
UM, AND-AND--
SO HAVE YOU BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THAT A LOT?
QUESTIONS IN YOUR LIFE
THAT GO BEYOND YOUR CAREER?
ARE THOSE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN
GOING ON IN YOUR MIND RECENTLY?
UH, YEAH. I--
ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT'S GOING
ON IN MY MIND VERY RECENTLY
IS BEING WITH CONRAD HALL,
KNOWING THAT HE'S GOT CANCER,
AND KNOWING THAT
I'M 80-AND-A-HALF YEARS OLD--
OR ALMOST 81, ACTUALLY.
SO I THINK
ABOUT MORTALITY.
I'VE BEEN
ASKED TO REMIND YOU
THAT THOSE PUMPKINS ARE FOR SALE.
LET'S NOT FORGET--
HALLOWEEN IS COMING!
HONEY, DO WE WANT TO BUY
A PUMPKIN, I THINK?
I'D LIKE TO BUY
A PUMPKIN.
WHEN I SIT ON CONRAD'S
BED AND HOLD HIS HAND
AND JUST TALK
TO HIM ABOUT--
ABOUT OUR LIVES,
ABOUT FILMMAKING AND SO FORTH,
I THINK ABOUT HOW CONRAD IS
SINCE WE'RE MAKING THIS FILM--
HOW CONRAD IS
WITH HIS FAMILY, WITH HIS KIDS.
I THINK THAT CONRAD
WAS ABLE TO DO
BETTER, MUCH BETTER,
THAN I DID.
DID YOU HAVE
GIRLFRIENDS WHEN YOU WERE
MARRIED TO MY MOTHER?
OH, YEAH.
I, UH,
WAS PROBABLY
CONSIDERED AN ACTIVE MALE,
BUT NOT ACTIVE
WITH MY HEART, REALLY.
SHE...
SUSPECTED SOMETHING ONCE,
AND, UM,
I DISSUADED HER,
BECAUSE WHAT SHE SUSPECTED
WAS NOTHING THAT MEANT
ANYTHING TO ME.
HASKELL!
AH! JESUS!
- OH MY GOD!
- HI, JANE.
SO, HOW ARE YOU
AFTER A THOUSAND YEARS?
I CANNOT BELIEVE
HOW NOT MELLOWED HE SEEMS.
HE SEEMS EXACTLY
THE SAME ENERGETICALLY,
IN HIS KIND OF SPARKLE AND SENSE
OF HUMOR, THE WAY HE LOOKS--
AND MY KID IS TRYING
TO MAKE ME CRAZY
BY SHOOTING THIS DOCUMENTARY.
I'M VERY SURPRISED
THAT HE HASN'T CHANGED MORE.
TROY'S HERE!
SOMEBODY THAT HELPED
CHANGE YOUR DIAPERS IS HERE,
WHEN YOU'RE OFF THE PHONE.
SO YOU CHANGED
MY DIAPERS, HUH?
WHEN TROY WAS BORN,
IT WAS A TIME OF
TREMENDOUS CONTROVERSY,
AND TOM HAYDEN AND I DECIDED
NOT TO BURDEN HIM WITH THE BAGGAGE
OF EITHER THE NAME
FONDA OR HAYDEN.
SO WE GAVE HIM THE NAME
OF HIS PATERNAL GRANDMOTHER,
HER MAIDEN NAME,
GARITY.
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT
YOU'RE A GROWN
PERSON WITH ALL THAT TALENT.
SO HE-- HE HAS HIS OWN NAME.
WE'RE JUST GONNA TALK
FOR A WHILE, AND THEN--
IF THEY NEED
AN OLD CAMERAMAN
ON ANY OF YOUR JOBS,
NOW, GIVE ME A CALL.
- OH, YEAH.
- OKAY. OKAY.
MY FATHER CAME OUT
OF AN IRISH BACKGROUND
AND WAS A MARINE
IN WORLD WAR ll
AND BECAME DEEPLY
DEPRESSED AND ANGRY
AT MY RADICAL
REBELLION AND JOURNEY,
AND FOR ABOUT 16 YEARS,
DENIED THAT I WAS HIS SON,
NEVER TALKED TO ME.
ONE DAY HIS NEW WIFE YELLED
AT HIM, "YOU STUBBORN IRISHMAN!
WHY DON'T YOU PICK UP
THE PHONE AND CALL TOM?"
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
I WAS MARRIED
AND I HAD A CHILD--
UM, A SMALL CHILD, TROY.
THE CHILDREN OF
THESE KINDS OF PARENTS
SPEND THE REST OF OUR LIVES
HEALING FROM THAT.
AND THE IMPORTANT THING
IS TO UNDERSTAND
THAT IT'S SOMETHING
THAT HE INHERITED--
YOU CAN BE SURE
HIS FATHER WAS THE SAME--
AND THAT WE HAVE TO
UNDERSTAND AND FORGIVE THEM.
IT'S NOT HIS FAULT.
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR ME
IS TO BECOME
A USEFUL ELDER TO MY KIDS.
AND PART OF BECOMING
A USEFUL ELDER IS
CUTTING OFF THE TOXIC
TRANSMISSION OF...
ALL OF THESE COMPLEXES THAT
ARE PASSED FROM FATHER TO SON,
IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR
MEN OF OUR FATHERS' GENERATION.
INTIMACY WAS NOT
THEIR GIFT.
THEY'RE BOTH...
EMPATHIC PEOPLE.
YOU COULDN'T BE THE KIND
OF ACTOR MY FATHER WAS
OR THE KIND
OF CINEMATOGRAPHER
AND DOCUMENTARIAN
THAT YOUR FATHER IS
WITHOUT BEING EMPATHIC,
BUT INTIMACY SCARES THEM.
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE YOU'VE
SEEN INTRODUCTION TO THE ENEMY?
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT
IN A LONG TIME.
- HAVE YOU?
- OH, I-- YEAH, YEAH.
IN 1974, TOM HAYDEN,
MY HUSBAND AT THE TIME,
DECIDED WITH ME THAT WE
WANTED TO DO A FILM CALLED
INTRODUCTION TO THE ENEMY
THAT WOULD HUMANIZE
THE VIETNAMESE.
AND HASKELL SEEMED LIKE
THE PERFECT PERSON TO FILM IT.
BEING IN HANOI NOW
IS LIKE SEEING A CITY
THAT'S COME BACK TO LIFE.
PARTLY BECAUSE OF HIS
GIFT AS A DOCUMENTARIAN
AND ALSO BECAUSE
OF HIS VALUES
AS A HUMAN BEING.
IT WAS VERY CRUDE, AND WE DID GO
ACROSS THE D.M.Z. INTO THE SOUTH,
AND IT WAS DIFFICULT.
AND, UM, IT WAS
MOVING FOR ME TO
WATCH HASKELL
UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES.
I MEAN, HASKELL
COMES FROM
A PRIVILEGED PLACE
IN SOCIETY.
HE COMES FROM MONEY. HE'S BEEN
ABLE TO LIVE WELL ALL HIS LIFE.
AND FOR PEOPLE LIKE US--
HASKELL AND ME, 'CAUSE I
ALSO COME FROM PRIVILEGE--
THERE'S ALWAYS
A TENSION BETWEEN, UM,
HOW WE LIVE AND WHAT WE ARE ABLE
TO DO BECAUSE OF OUR CLASS AND RACE
UP AGAINST PEOPLE
WHO ARE NOT PRIVILEGED.
AND THAT WAS CERTAINLY
THE CASE IN VIETNAM.
WHEN DID YOU DECIDE TO, UH,
JOIN THE RESISTANCE, AND WHY?
AND I JUST REMEMBER ONE DAY
HE CAME DOWN TO BREAKFAST
AND HE SAID, "HOW--
HOW HAVE YOU DONE IT?
HOW HAVE YOU JUST
GIVEN IT ALL UP?"
AND I DON'T REMEMBER
WHAT I SAID,
BUT OF COURSE I HADN'T
GIVEN IT ALL UP ANYWAY.
BUT I WAS SO TOUCHED
THAT HE WAS SEARCHING
THAT WAY WITHIN HIMSELF.
THAT'S THE KIND
OF PERSON HE IS.
OH, MY GOD. THERE'S
SO MUCH. YOU MISS HAL?
I DO, VERY MUCH.
YOU WERE SUCH
AN INCREDIBLE PARTNERSHIP.
HIS STYLE
AND YOUR STYLE
WAS SO SYNCHRONISTIC.
YEAH, I REALLY
MISS HIM.
WASN'T THAT FUN,
THAT MOVIE, COMING HOME?
IN COMING HOME,
I THINK I REMEMBER CORRECTLY
WHEN WE HAD THE NAKED SCENE
IN BED... -OH, GOD, YES.
AND I REMEMBER
ON "CUT,"
YOU GOT UP AND WENT TO THE PHONE
AND TALKED TO CESAR CHAVEZ.
I DON'T REMEMBER THAT!
YOU JUST FINISHED MAKING
THESE ORGIASTIC SOUNDS,
AND THEY PUT A BATHROBE--
"OH, HI, CESAR". -YEAH.
AS YOU CAN SEE,
AFTER FIVE YEARS, WE GET DOWN.
- WE JUST GO RIGHT DOWN THERE.
- RIGHT!
WE GO RIGHT TO IT.
COULD YOU TAKE
THIS THING OFF OF ME? AND ALSO,
I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
I HAVE NOT SIGNED A RELEASE FOR HIM,
SO BEFORE HE FINISHES
THIS FILM,
IF THERE'S ANYTHING--
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
THAT I DON'T LIKE
OR YOU DON'T LIKE, OUTSVILLE.
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, HE'S
A VERY CONSERVATIVE PERSON.
ACTUALLY, BEFORE I TAKE
THAT OFF, HOLD ON ONE SECOND.
YES, MARK.
MARK, THIS IS
CINEMA VERITE.
THIS IS SO IMPORTANT.
THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO HIM.
AND IT'S NOT EASY, 'CAUSE HE'S
TRODDING INTO YOUR WORLD NOW,
AND HE'S SCARED TO DEATH.
YEAH.
YOU NOTICED THAT?
- I GIVE HIM A HARD TIME.
- THAT'S GOOD.
MOST PEOPLE
PERFORM IN RELATIONSHIP
TO THEIR PARENTS
OR THEIR CHILDREN.
THEY'RE NOT HONEST.
THEY ACT HONEST TO YOU
RATHER THAN BEING HONEST,
SO WHATEVER MY ADVICE IS,
WHATEVER SOMEBODY TELLS YOU
AS THE HONEST ANSWER
TO A QUESTION,
GO DEEPER, BECAUSE
IT'S MORE LIKELY TO BE A FRONT--
UNCONSCIOUSLY, A FRONT--
FOR WHAT THEY REALLY
DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT.
HAVE YOU DONE OTHER
SHOOTING OF MARIAN HERE?
UH, SOME STILLS.
I'D LIKE TO BRING MY MOTHER OUT
IN THE WHEELCHAIR IN HERE
FOR THIS AIR.
YOU SURE SHE'LL BE
WARM ENOUGH? -HUH?
I HOPE
SHE'LL BE WARM ENOUGH.
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
HERE, I GOT IT.
HI. HI, MOM.
- HOW ARE YOU?
- HOW ARE YOU?
HI, MARE. HI, MARE, IT'S
HASKELL. HOW ARE YOU, HONEY?
HOW ARE YOU, MARIAN? SO MARK
IS HERE TAKING YOUR PICTURE.
HE'S TAKING YOUR PICTURE.
WE'RE JUST GONNA GET SOMETHING
TO MAKE YOU A LITTLE WARMER.
LET'S PUT
YOUR SWEATER ON.
LITTLE BIT CHILLY
THIS MORNING.
THERE, WE GET THIS
OVER HER.
IT'S A COOL DAY.
I WAS IN CHICAGO YESTERDAY,
AND, UM, I WENT BY,
THE WILMETTE THEATER,
WHICH IS
NO LONGER THERE.
AND, UH, UNCLE PETE'S
HOUSE IS TORN DOWN.
AND THE WILMETTE'S
ALL DIFFERENT NOW.
REMEMBER WE USED TO GO--
WE WENT TO DIMETRI'S
AND WE GOT SANDWICHES?
WE RODE ON
THE OUTER DRIVE.
WE'VE GOT SECRETS.
WE'VE GOT SECRETS.
WE KNOW THINGS--
YOU, ME.
WE KNOW THINGS
ABOUT EACH OTHER.
I KNOW.
YES, THAT NOBODY ELSE
IN THE WORLD KNOWS.
DAD, I JUST WANT YOU
TO KNOW THAT I'M NOT--
I ALWAYS FELT THAT YOU
THOUGHT THAT I WAS MAD AT YOU
ABOUT BREAKING UP WITH MY MOM,
AND I'M NOT MAD ANYMORE.
GOOD. I KNEW YOU DID,
AND THAT BOTHERED ME.
BREAKING UP
OR STOP BEING MARRIED
AND SO FORTH
AFTER THAT MANY YEARS--
AND NOT--
NOT, LIKE,
BAD YEARS, YOU KNOW?
ALL I CAN--
ALL I CAN THINK OF
WHEN I WAS TALKING TO HER
WAS HOW MUCH ENJOYMENT,
HOW MUCH PLEASURE
WE GAVE EACH OTHER.
YOUR MOTHER WAS
AN INCREDIBLY GOOD ARTIST.
I WAS THINKING--
WE WERE ON A LAKE IN GUATEMALA.
LAKE PANAJACHEL.
SHE WOULD PAINT
AND I WOULD SHOOT,
AND, UM,
IT WAS LIKE--
IT WAS LOVE, YOU KNOW?
WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?
ALL I CAN JUST SAY IS,
PEOPLE LOOK FOR DIFFERENT
THINGS IN THEIR LIFE.
IT'S HARD TO PUT BLAME
ON ME JUST
WANTING TO BE
A BIG-SHOT CAMERAMAN
AND MARIAN NOT BEING
WITH IT, OR--
YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO--
IT'S NONE OF THOSE THINGS.
IT'S THOSE-- IT'S THOSE
SUBTLE HUMAN THINGS THAT--
THAT WE SELDOM REALLY...
UNDERSTAND.
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, MARK?
WHAT'S-- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
AND HOW ARE YOU
GONNA DIFFERENTIATE
THIS... THING,
THIS SCENE THAT HAPPENED?
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE CAMERA,
AND IN A SENSE, IT, UM--
IN A SENSE,
IT COLORS A SITUATION.
I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
FOR MYSELF,
I KNEW YOUR CAMERA WAS THERE,
BUT I DIDN'T GIVE A SHIT.
I MEAN--
AND I THINK THAT, UM--
AND NOW I'M THINKING,
"WELL, MAYBE THE CAMERA
SORT OF INVADED
SOMETHING DEEPLY
PERSONAL TO ME".
AND THEN
I SHOULD SAY, WELL,
"SO WHAT?"
YOU KNOW? SO WHAT?
IT DIDN'T STOP
THE REAL THING.
I APPRECIATE YOU
TRUSTING ME WITH THAT.
SO WHAT WE DO IS,
WE WRITE IT ALL UP
AND OF COURSE,
WE'LL TALK NUMBERS AND WHAT,
GIVE YOU AN IDEA
OF WHAT WE THINK
CERTAIN GEAR WOULD BE SELLING
FOR NOW ON THE CURRENT MARKET--
IT WAS A BIG MOMENT
FOR HASKELL TO DEPART,
TO CONSIDER SELLING
HIS CAMERA GEAR.
IT'S ALWAYS
SO CLOSE TO HIM.
SO LIKE YOU SAID,
HE WAS MENTALLY NOT PREPARED.
NOW, YOU SEE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS--
I MEAN, THIS KIND OF THING
HAS GOT TO BE SOLD WITH-WITH LOVE,
'CAUSE THIS INCREDIBLE CAMERA
HAD THIS MOTOR ADAPTED TO IT.
I MEAN, YOU WILL MAKE
THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PICTURES--
I'LL TAKE A COUPLE
OF LIGHT ONES. I LEARNED THAT--
TO GRAB THE SMALL CASES.
AND WHEN I LOOK AT HASKELL,
I SEE A TORTURED SOUL,
BECAUSE HE KNOWS IT'S CLOSE
TO THE END OF THE LINE
IN TERMS OF WORK.
BUT FOR YEARS,
I SAW THIS.
HE'S GOT TO DO MORE.
HE'S GOT TO DO BETTER.
HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN
A DIRECTOR.
HE COULD HAVE SHOWN
THESE GUYS HOW TO DO IT.
IT'S ALL "SHOULD'VE".
AND THE SHOULD'VES
ARE A CURSE.
MARK AND I HAVE HAD
OUR DIFFERENCES IN LIFE,
AND CONRAD WAS SORT OF
A FOSTER FATHER TO MARK
AND A REALLY
GENUINELY GOOD GUY,
AND I KNOW-- I SUSPECT
WHY HE WAS:
'CAUSE MARK AND CONRAD
LAUGHED TOGETHER.
I LOOKED AT 'EM ONCE TALKING,
AND I SAID TO MYSELF, "GODDAMN IT,
HE LIKES CONRAD MORE
THAN HE LIKES ME".
IT IS TRUE, NOT EVERYONE CAN
BE ALL THINGS TO ALL PEOPLE.
I CAN TELL
THAT HE LOVES YOU,
AND HE IS SCARED OF
WHAT YOU MAY DO TO HIM
OR EXPOSE IN HIM
IN THIS FILM.
I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S
ANYTHING MORE IMPORTANT
THAN MAKING PEACE
BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.
MAYBE I'M TOO TIGHT.
THIS IS HARD TO FOCUS.
AND IT ALMOST ALWAYS
RELIES ON THE CHILD
TO MOVE TO THE PARENT.
IF YOU JUST SET
THE FOCUS RIGHT HERE
AND THEN MEET ME
WITH THE ZOOM--
NEVER MIND CHANGING
FOCUS AT ALL. -OKAY. OKAY.
- OKAY?
- BUT JUST BE PATIENT.
'CAUSE THAT SPEAKS VOLUMES.
AND IT'S AN INVITATION.
PATIENCE IS ALWAYS AN INVITATION.
OKAY.
BECAUSE IT'S FILLED WITH SUCH HOPE.
AH. THAT'S BETTER.
