CAMERA EQUIPMENT
AND SO FORTH

00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,611
IS-- IS VERY MUCH
A PART OF MY LIFE.

00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:14,614
THIS-- THIS MAGAZINE

00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:16,616

00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,623
<i>WHEN I SHOT</i>
AMERICA AMERICA.

9
00:00:23,623 --> 00:00:26,626
<i>DAD, CAN YOU TELL US
WHERE WE ARE RIGHT NOW AND--</i>

10
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:29,128
IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHERE
THE FUCK WE ARE RIGHT NOW,

11
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,131
JUST LOOK AROUND.

12
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:33,133
YOU'RE MAKING
A GODDAMN DOCUMENTARY,

13
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:36,637
<i>SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ME
SAY IN FRONT OF THE CAMERA

14
00:00:36,638 --> 00:00:37,538
<i>WHERE WE ARE.

15
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:39,639
YOU DID A SHOT
OF SOME OF THE EQUIPMENT,

16
00:00:39,639 --> 00:00:42,642
<i>DAD--</i> -YOU GET A SHOT
OF THE SIGN, YOU KNOW?

17
00:00:42,642 --> 00:00:45,645
<i>DAD, YOU MIGHT WANT TO TELL US
THAT WE'RE IN YOUR EQUIPMENT ROOM,

18
00:00:45,645 --> 00:00:47,146
<i>YOU'VE HAD IT</i>
<i>FOR SEVERAL YEARS,</i> <i>AND YOU--</i>

19
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:49,149
<i>WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY?</i>
<i>WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY?</i>

20
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,151
MARK, I--
LOOKIT.

21
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:56,656
DOCUMENTARY FILMMAKING, MY KIND,
ANYWAY, IS NOT SHOW-AND-TELL.

22
00:00:56,656 --> 00:00:58,859
IN OTHER WORDS, I DON'T TELL
THEM WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN,

23
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,160
WHAT'S THE SCENE, AND SO FORTH.

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,663
IN OTHER WORDS,
IF YOU SHOOT A SCENE,

25
00:01:03,663 --> 00:01:04,765
IF THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENS,

26
00:01:04,766 --> 00:01:06,166
THEN IT WILL BE CLEAR
TO THE AUDIENCE.

27
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:08,168
THEN IT HAS
SOME VALIDITY.

28
00:01:08,168 --> 00:01:12,172
OTHERWISE, IT LOSES
ITS... HONESTY.

29
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:17,177
<i>AND SO I'M TELLING YOU</i>
<i>TWO THINGS--</i>

30
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,179
<i>ONE IS, WHATEVER HAPPENS</i>
<i>IN THIS ROOM</i>

31
00:01:19,179 --> 00:01:21,181
<i>IS GONNA HAPPEN</i>
<i>IN THIS ROOM.</i>

32
00:01:21,181 --> 00:01:23,683
IF YOU GET IT,
THAT'S FINE.

33
00:01:23,683 --> 00:01:25,685
IF YOU DON'T GET IT,
TOUGH SHIT.

34
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:32,692
<i>EVEN THOUGH I'VE MADE
SEVERAL DOCUMENTARIES IN THE PAST,</i>

35
00:01:32,692 --> 00:01:36,195
<i>THE IDEA OF DOING</i>
<i>ONE OF MY FATHER</i> <i>SEEMS DAUNTING.</i>

36
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:40,200
<i>I RECOGNIZE ALL</i>
<i>MY DAD'S ACHIEVEMENTS,</i>

37
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,204
<i>AND I RESPECT HIS POSITION IN
THE HISTORY OF AMERICAN CINEMA,

38
00:01:44,204 --> 00:01:49,209
<i>BUT I'M NOT EXACTLY</i>
<i>WHAT YOU'D CALL A FAN.</i>

39
00:01:49,209 --> 00:01:52,212
<i>I'M A SON, THE SON</i>
<i>OF A FAMOUS FATHER,</i>

40
00:01:52,212 --> 00:01:55,215
<i>AND I'VE SPENT MUCH OF MY
ADULT LIFE STRUGGLING TO STEP OUT

41
00:01:55,215 --> 00:01:57,217
<i>FROM UNDER THE SHADOW</i>
<i>OF THAT FAME.</i>

42
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,222
<i>I REMEMBER HAVING DINNER</i>

43
00:02:02,222 --> 00:02:05,225
<i>WITH YOU AND MARIAN</i>
<i>AND HASKELL</i>

44
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,227
<i>AT A RESTAURANT
IN LOS ANGELES.

45
00:02:07,227 --> 00:02:09,229
AND WE CAME OUT,

46
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,232
AND THERE WAS SOMEONE THAT
YOU WANTED TO TALK TO,

47
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:15,235
BUT YOU WERE A LITTLE SHY
ABOUT APPROACHING THEM.

48
00:02:15,235 --> 00:02:17,237
AND HASKELL TURNED
TO YOU AND SAID,

49
00:02:17,237 --> 00:02:19,239
"GO AHEAD.
TELL THEM WHO YOU ARE".

50
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:22,242
AND YOUR MOTHER SAID,
"WHAT HE MEANS IS,

51
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,244
TELL THEM THAT YOU'RE
HASKELL WEXLER'S SON".

52
00:02:24,244 --> 00:02:26,746
<i>AND WHO IS HASKELL WEXLER?</i>

53
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:28,247
<i>HE'S A CINEMATOGRAPHER.</i>

54
00:02:28,248 --> 00:02:29,749
<i>OH!</i>

55
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,751
- WELL--
- ARE WE GONNA BE ON TV?

56
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,757
<i>SOME HAVE CALLED MY FATHER
THE BABE RUTH OF CINEMATOGRAPHY,</i>

57
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,759
<i>AND HE'S WORKED WITH</i>
<i>SUCH HEAVY HITTERS</i>

58
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:44,764
<i>AS JACK NICHOLSON,</i>
<i>ELIZABETH TAYLOR</i> <i>AND PAUL NEWMAN.</i>

59
00:02:44,764 --> 00:02:47,266
<i>YOU KNOW, YOU LOOK
AT THE BODY OF WORK,</i>

60
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:50,770
<i>THE MOMENTS HE'S CREATED</i>
<i>OR CAPTURED OR INVENTED,</i>

61
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,272
<i>AND YOU GO,</i>

62
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:57,277
<i>"THIS IS ALMOST THE HISTORY</i>
<i>OF CONTEMPORARY FILM</i>

63
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,778
<i>HASKELL HAS HAD A HAND IN</i>

64
00:02:58,778 --> 00:03:00,780

OR A LENS IN".

65
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,183
<i>EVERY CINEMATOGRAPHER</i>

66
00:03:02,184 --> 00:03:04,284
<i>HAS HIS OWN WAY OF
LOOKING AT THE WORLD.</i>

67
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,786
<i>IT'S LIKE, EVERY STILL
PHOTOGRAPHER OR EVERY PAINTER.</i>

68
00:03:06,786 --> 00:03:08,089
<i>IN THE BEGINNING,</i>
<i>WHEN I WAS IN FILM SCHOOL,</i>

69
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,690
<i>I WAS VERY MUCH INTO THAT</i>

70
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:11,791
<i>VERY REALISTIC-LOOKING</i>
<i>PHOTOGRAPHY.</i>

71
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,794
AND THAT IS THE KIND OF
STYLE OF PHOTOGRAPHY

72
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:16,796
THAT, REALLY,
HASKELL SPECIALIZED IN.

73
00:03:16,796 --> 00:03:20,299
<i>WE ALL HAVE OUR OWN INSTRUMENTS,</i>

74
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,801
<i>AND HASKELL'S</i>
<i>INSTRUMENT IS--</i>

75
00:03:21,801 --> 00:03:24,303
<i>I ALWAYS THINK OF IT</i>
<i>AS THE HAND-HELD CAMERA.</i>

76
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:26,806
<i>HE'S A GREAT FILMMAKER</i>

77
00:03:26,806 --> 00:03:28,808
<i>AND A GREAT</i>
<i>CINEMATOGRAPHER</i>

78
00:03:28,808 --> 00:03:33,312
AND, OF COURSE,
A DEAR FRIEND.

79
00:03:33,313 --> 00:03:36,316
<i>THE MINUTE I MET HIM
ON</i> COMING HOME,

80
00:03:36,316 --> 00:03:39,819
I KNEW THAT THIS WAS
AS IT SHOULD BE-- IT WAS MAGICAL.

81
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:42,822
IT WAS MAGICAL.

82
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:44,824
<i>HE WAS SUCH A PERFECTIONIST</i>

83
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:47,326
<i>AND HE HAS SUCH A SKILL</i>
<i>AND A TALENT AND AN INSIGHT</i>

84
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,830
TO WHAT HE DID FOR A LIVING,
AND HE HAD SUCH PRIDE IN IT.

85
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:54,333
<i>YOUR FATHER WAS BORN</i>
<i>WITH MONEY,</i>

86
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,836
<i>BUT HE'S THE HARDEST WORKER</i>
<i>I'VE EVER SEEN,</i>

87
00:03:56,836 --> 00:04:00,339
AND HIS FEELING FOR THE WORKERS
CERTAINLY PUTS HIM INTO A--

88
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:02,842
IT'S VERY MUCH LIKE
DIEGO RIVERA IN MY MIND.

89
00:04:02,842 --> 00:04:04,645
<i>HE'S BEEN ARRESTED,
THROWN IN JAIL,</i>

90
00:04:04,646 --> 00:04:05,746
<i>THREATENED WITH GUNS,

91
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:08,347
<i>THE F.B.I. PROBABLY</i>
<i>HAD A FILE ON HIM.</i>

92
00:04:08,348 --> 00:04:09,851
<i>HE DIDN'T GIVE A DAMN,</i>
<i>YOU KNOW?</i>

93
00:04:09,852 --> 00:04:11,752
HE'S WHAT I CALL
<i>A TRUE AMERICAN LIBERAL.</i>

94
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,353
AND PROBABLY NOT EVEN THAT.
HE'D PROBABLY HATE THAT WORD.

95
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:15,556
<i>BUT HE BELIEVES IN THE DOWNTRODDEN</i>

96
00:04:15,557 --> 00:04:16,757
<i>AND THE DISPOSSESSED.</i>

97
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:20,359
<i>YOU KNOW, YOU CANNOT HELP</i>
<i>BUT ADMIRE THIS PERSON.</i>

98
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,862
<i>MY FATHER'S CAREER</i>
<i>AS A DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY</i>

99
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,865
<i>SPANS MORE THAN FIVE DECADES</i>
<i>OF WORKING IN FEATURES,</i>

100
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,868
<i>DOCUMENTARIES</i>
<i>AND COMMERCIALS.</i>

101
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:32,872
<i>HE'S EVEN WRITTEN, DIRECTED
AND PRODUCED HIS OWN FILMS.</i>

102
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:36,876
<i>BUT HE'S BEST KNOWN AND MOST
APPRECIATED FOR HIS CAMERA WORK.</i>

103
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:42,381
AMERICAN GRAFFITI
<i>WAS VERY FAST-PACED,</i>

104
00:04:42,382 --> 00:04:45,385
<i>AND SO IT WAS A FILM</i>
<i>MADE IN CHAOS.</i>

105
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:48,388
<i>THE FIRST WEEK WE WERE</i>
<i>SHOOTING IN THE DRIVE-IN,</i>

106
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,890
<i>AND HE SAID, "WELL, WE'LL
MAKE THIS KIND OF LIKE A JUKE BOX,"

107
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,892
AND HE REALLY ADDED
A LOT OF QUALITY TO THE WHOLE THING

108
00:04:52,892 --> 00:04:55,895
THAT I HADN'T REALLY
THOUGHT OF.

109
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:58,898
<i>EVERYBODY INVOLVED
IN THE MOVIE FROM THE ACTING SIDE</i>

110
00:04:58,898 --> 00:05:00,202
<i>DIDN'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT
GEORGE LUCAS

111
00:05:00,203 --> 00:05:02,803
<i>BUT WAS VERY IMPRESSED
THAT HASKELL WEXLER

112
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,905
<i>WAS KILLING HIMSELF</i>
<i>TO COME WORK ON THIS MOVIE.</i>

113
00:05:05,905 --> 00:05:07,406
<i>I MEAN, IT WAS INSANE.</i>
<i>HE WOULD SHOOT</i>

114
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:09,909
<i>A COMMERCIAL DURING THE DAY</i>
<i>IN LOS ANGELES,</i>

115
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,912
<i>THEN FLY INTO SAN FRANCISCO,</i>
<i>DRIVE TO MARIN COUNTY</i>

116
00:05:12,912 --> 00:05:14,914
WORK THERE UNTIL DAWN,
AND THEN GO GET ON A PLANE,

117
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,917
AND HE WAS DOING THIS, YOU KNOW,
NOT JUST ONCE IN A WHILE.

118
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,419
IT SEEMED LIKE HE WAS JUST
DOING IT THREE, FOUR NIGHTS A WEEK.

119
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:23,423
THEY CALL ME MR. TIBBS.

120
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:26,426
IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT
<i>FOLLOWED THE STORY</i>

121
00:05:26,426 --> 00:05:29,929
<i>OF THIS BLACK DETECTIVE.</i>

122
00:05:29,929 --> 00:05:33,933
THERE'S A SCENE
WHERE THEY PUT THE DOGS--

123
00:05:33,933 --> 00:05:37,436
<i>YOU KNOW, THE SOUTHERNERS ARE</i>
<i>ALWAYS USING DOGS-- HOUNDS--</i>

124
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:39,939
<i>AND HE PUT THE BLOODHOUNDS</i>
<i>OR THE HOUNDS ON HIM.</i>

125
00:05:39,939 --> 00:05:42,441
<i>OF COURSE, THERE WERE</i>
<i>NO STEADICAMS IN THOSE DAYS.</i>

126
00:05:42,442 --> 00:05:44,444
YOUR DAD IS ALSO
A DIRECTOR,

127
00:05:44,444 --> 00:05:48,448
SO I'M SURE THAT HE HAD
SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR NORMAN.

128
00:05:48,448 --> 00:05:50,450
<i>YOUR DAD HAD A TINY,</i>
<i>LITTLE ECLAIR CAMERA--</i>

129
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:52,952
<i>IT SOUNDED LIKE</i>
<i>A COFFEE GRINDER--</i>

130
00:05:52,952 --> 00:05:56,956
<i>AND HE USED TO</i>
<i>HAND-HOLD EVERYTHING.</i>

131
00:05:56,956 --> 00:05:58,958
<i>SO HE GOT A COUPLE</i>
<i>OF TWO-BY-FOURS,</i>

132
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,961
<i>MOUNTED THE CAMERA</i>
<i>ABOUT THE HEIGHT OF A DOG,</i>

133
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,067
<i>AND, ON A WIDE-ANGLE LENS,</i>

134
00:06:06,068 --> 00:06:07,868
<i>WE JUST FOLLOWED THIS GUY</i>
<i>THROUGH THE BUSH.</i>

135
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:11,470
BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOME
GOOD SHOTS THERE.

136
00:06:14,974 --> 00:06:17,476
<i>MUCH HAS BEEN WRITTEN
ABOUT MY DAD.</i>

137
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:19,479
<i>HE'S A TWO-TIME</i>
<i>OSCAR WINNER,</i>

138
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:22,482
<i>A SOUGHT-AFTER VOICE</i>
<i>FOR DVD COMMENTARIES,</i>

139
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:24,287
<i>AND THE MOTION PICTURE ACADEMY</i>

140
00:06:24,288 --> 00:06:27,388
<i>IS PREPARING AN ORAL
HISTORY ON HIS CAREER.

141
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,989
<i>PUSHING 80,</i>
<i>HE'S A RIPE SUBJECT</i> <i>FOR A TRIBUTE,</i>

142
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:33,492
<i>THOUGH I GUESS HE MAY HAVE SOME
SECOND THOUGHTS ABOUT HIS SON

143
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:36,496
<i>PICKING UP THE CAMERA</i>
<i>AND TURNING THE LENS ON HIM.</i>

144
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:40,500
<i>I AM NOT THOSE PICTURES.</i>

145
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,003
<i>I AM HASKELL WEXLER</i>
<i>AND YOU'RE MY SON.</i>

146
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:46,505
<i>NOW, I CAN UNDERSTAND WHY</i>

147
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,008
<i>YOU WANT TO TALK TO</i>
<i>SOME OF THE WELL-KNOWN PEOPLE</i>

148
00:06:49,008 --> 00:06:51,010
<i>WHO HAVE BEEN</i>
<i>IN MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE--</i>

149
00:06:53,513 --> 00:06:55,014
OH, HASKELL!

150
00:06:55,014 --> 00:06:58,517
I MEAN, WHAT-- WHAT DOES
AN ACTOR SAY ABOUT A LEGEND?

151
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:03,523
BUT I DON'T WANT
THAT KIND OF BIOGRAPHY.

152
00:07:03,523 --> 00:07:06,526
<i>I'M NOT GONNA SAY I WAS
LIKE A SON TO HIM,</i>

153
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,528
BUT IT WAS
SORT OF LIKE THAT.

154
00:07:08,528 --> 00:07:11,030
I WAS, LIKE, THE STUDENT
AND HE WAS, LIKE, THE TEACHER.

155
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,033
I WOULD LIKE TO
BE ABLE TO USE

156
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:18,537
OUR FILMMAKING-- MAYBE EVEN
ABOUT EACH OTHER A LITTLE BIT--

157
00:07:18,538 --> 00:07:23,042
TO BREAK DOWN SOME OF THE
WALLS THAT-- THAT HAPPEN

158
00:07:23,042 --> 00:07:26,545
AS WITH ANY
FATHERS AND SONS AS THEY GET OLDER

159
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:29,048
AND THEY GET
MORE INDEPENDENT.

160
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:31,050
<i>SO WHAT'S HE SAYING?</i>

161

<i>IT WOULD BE GREAT TO GET

236
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:13,272

I'M NOT GONNA GO ON A DOCUMENTARY

240
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,781
NO, YOU STILL DO NEED
A SOUND GUY WITH A BOOM.

241
00:11:22,782 --> 00:11:24,186
<i>I SHOULD'VE
TAKEN THEIR ADVICE</i>

WANT SOMETHING IN THE MIRROR.

249
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:53,812
NOW, MARK, WE STARTED THERE,
AND WHY DID WE STOP?

250
00:11:53,813 --> 00:11:56,315
- THERE'S A FOCUS PROBLEM?
- YEAH.

251
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:59,818
WHOSE FOCUS PROBLEM?
IT LOOKS LIKE MY CAMERA'S IN FOCUS.

252
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:03,823

<i>CERTAINLY, THE WHOLE WAY</i>
<i>I DEALT WITH THE WAR EXPERIENCE</i>

281
00:13:32,912 --> 00:13:34,914

AND I LIKED THAT
VERY MUCH.

289
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,943
UH, I THINK, IN RETROSPECT,
WHAT I LIKED ABOUT IT

290
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:06,946
<i>IS THAT IDEA</i>
<i>OF BEING THERE,</i>

291
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:08,948
<i>BUT BEING THE OBSERVER.</i>

292
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:13,953
<i>UH, BEING THERE AND, UH,</i>
<i>NOT BEING THERE, IN A SENSE.</i>

293
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,558
<i>IN TIME,
MY DAD'S FATHER</i>

294
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:19,359

<i>BY INVESTING THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS

<i>IN DES PLAINES, ILLINOIS.</i>

297
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:30,970
<i>I MADE THIS FILM CALLED</i>
HALF CENTURY WITH COTTON,

298
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:33,472
<i>AND I WENT DOWN THERE</i>
<i>LIKE A DOCUMENTARIAN,</i>

299
00:14:33,472 --> 00:14:36,475
<i>AND I SHOT FOOTAGE</i>
<i>OF THIS COTTON-MILL TOWN</i>

300
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:40,979
<i>WHERE THE COMPANY OWNED
THE HOUSES THAT PEOPLE LIVED IN.

301
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,482
<i>PEACE, COMFORT, SECURITY.</i>

302
00:14:43,482 --> 00:14:47,486
<i>THESE ARE TRADITIONAL WITH</i>
<i>OPELIKA MILLS WORKERS.</i>

303
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,489
<i>WHEN I BROUGHT THE FILM
FOR HERBIE SNOWER TO SEE--</i>

304
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:54,094
<i>THE HEAD OF THE COMPANY--</i>
<i>HE SAID, "WHAT IS ALL THIS SHIT</i>

305
00:14:54,095 --> 00:14:55,995

306

309
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:10,509

<i>WITH A FULL UNION CREW,</i>

311
00:15:12,511 --> 00:15:15,013
<i>BECAUSE I NEEDED</i>

312
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,516
<i>TO LIGHT UP HUGE INTERIORS</i>
<i>OF THE FACTORY</i>

313

<i>I WOULD EVER HAVE MADE</i>
<i>ON THAT FILM,</i>

316
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:26,025
<i>BUT I WAS OBLIGED</i>
<i>TO DO THAT.</i>

317
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,830
<i>HIS FATHER HAD INVESTED</i>

318
00:15:29,831 --> 00:15:31,431

319
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:36,034
<i>AND HASKELL TOLD ME</i>
<i>WHAT HIS FATHER SAID TO HIM.</i>

320
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:39,038
HE SAYS, "YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE A MAGICIAN.

321
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:43,542
YOU CAN TAKE GOOD MONEY
AND TURN IT INTO <i>SHIT</i>".

322
00:15:45,044 --> 00:15:47,546
<i>THAT HIT ME VERY HARD.</i>

323
00:15:47,546 --> 00:15:49,548
<i>I MEAN, THAT WAS A STATEMENT</i>
<i>FOR SOMEBODY TO MAKE</i>

324
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:52,050
<i>ABOUT THE FATHER</i>
<i>SAYING IT.</i>

325
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:55,054
<i>BUT IT WAS</i>
<i>JUST A FACT--</i>

326
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:58,557
<i>HE DIDN'T MAKE IT</i>
<i>IN CHICAGO.</i>

327
00:15:58,557 --> 00:16:01,560
<i>THAT LESS-THAN-FAVORABLE</i>
<i>COMMENT FROM HIS FATHER</i>

328
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:04,062
<i>DIDN'T HAMPER MY DAD'S</i>
<i>FILMMAKING PURSUITS.</i>

329
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,065
<i>HE GAVE UP HIS STUDIO</i>
<i>AND WENT TO WORK</i>

330
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:09,068
<i>AS A FREELANCE CAMERAMAN,</i>
<i>A GUN FOR HIRE,</i>

331
00:16:09,068 --> 00:16:12,571
<i>AND OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS</i>
<i>SHOT SPORTS,</i>

<i>AND SHORT SUBJECTS,</i>

333
00:16:15,074 --> 00:16:18,077
<i>TWO OF WHICH WERE NOMINATED</i>
<i>FOR ACADEMY AWARDS.</i>

334
00:16:18,077 --> 00:16:21,181
<i>MY FAVORITE WAS A SHORT FILM</i>
<i>HE PHOTOGRAPHED FOR</i>

00:16:21,182 --> 00:16:22,482
<i>LEWIS CLYDE STALLMAN</i>

336
00:16:22,581 --> 00:16:25,584
<i>ABOUT A TUMBLEWEED'S JOURNEY</i>
<i>THROUGH THE DESERT.</i>

337
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:29,087
<i>SO MANY OF THESE DOCUMENTARIES</i>
<i>ARE DRY AND DIDACTIC.</i>

338
00:16:29,088 --> 00:16:33,592
<i>THIS FILM WAS WITTY</i>
<i>AND WHIMSICAL, FOR A CHANGE.</i>

339
00:16:33,592 --> 00:16:37,095
<i>BY NOW, HE WAS DEVELOPING A SOLID
REPUTATION AS A CINEMATOGRAPHER,

<i>CAME KNOCKING.</i>

341
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:43,101
<i>HE WOULD EVENTUALLY WIN</i>
<i>TWO ACADEMY AWARDS--</i>

<i>ONE FOR</i> WHO'S AFRAID

<i>BUT BACK IN THE EARLY '60s</i>

347
00:16:57,116 --> 00:16:59,618

<i>ABOUT THE 1963 CIVIL RIGHTS</i>
<i>MARCH ON WASHINGTON,</i>

350

<i>THAT HE WOULD PURSUE RELENTLESSLY.

352

HIM AS A PIONEER

<i>OF A NEW STYLE OF DOCUMENTARY

354
00:17:18,137 --> 00:17:20,139
<i>CALLED CINEMA VERITE.</i>

355
00:17:20,139 --> 00:17:21,342
THIS IS THE THING.

356
00:17:21,343 --> 00:17:23,543
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS
THE ETHIC OF THE WHOLE THING.

357
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:26,645
YOU ARE WILLING TO GET OFF
OF THIS BUS ANYTIME-- YOU KNOW

358

THAT YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO BE BOTHERED.

359
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:31,451
NO ONE'S GONNA CALL YOU DOWN
"NIGGER-LOVER" OR "NIGGER".

360
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:34,153
YOU-- LET ME FINISH!
LET ME FINISH!

<i>CINEMA VERITE-- OR WE PREFER
THE TERM "DIRECT CINEMA"--</i>

362
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:41,660

<i>IN ORDER FOR IT TO BE</i>

363
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:43,662
<i>A DOCUMENTARY,</i>
<i>IN MY BELIEF.</i>

364
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:47,165
AND UNFORTUNATELY, SO MANY
PEOPLE MAKING DOCUMENTARIES

365
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:51,170
DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF CONFIDENCE
THAT THEY CAN GET TO THE TRUTH.

366
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,673
<i>AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT,</i>
<i>I THINK,</i>

367
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:59,177
<i>IS THAT YOU REALLY LIKE</i>
<i>THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE FILMING,</i>

368
00:17:59,178 --> 00:18:02,681
<i>THAT YOU EMPATHIZE WITH THEM,</i>
<i>THAT AS YOU LOOK AT THEM,</i>

369
00:18:02,681 --> 00:18:06,184
<i>EVEN ESPECIALLY THE FIRST
MOMENT YOU MEET SOMEBODY,</i>

370
00:18:06,185 --> 00:18:09,688
<i>THAT PERSON LOOKS BACK</i>
<i>AT YOU AND SAYS TO THEMSELVES,</i>

371
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:11,189
"I CAN TRUST THIS GUY".

372
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,695
- HEY, MARK?
- <i>YEAH?</i>

WE'RE GOING TO WALK
DOWN TO PEABODY'S,

375
00:18:22,701 --> 00:18:26,705

OF THE SEMI-RURAL, SUBURBAN,

376
00:18:26,705 --> 00:18:30,208
RICH-PEOPLE'S LIFE
OF MONTECITO, AND ON THE WAY,

377
00:18:30,209 --> 00:18:34,713

SOMETHING USEFUL.

378
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:38,717
UH, NOW,
I'M GOING OUT THE DOOR.

379
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:41,720
I CAN SUGGEST
THAT YOU CUT NOW.

380
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,222

FATHER-AND-SON
RELATIONSHIPS

382
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:49,728

383
00:18:49,728 --> 00:18:54,232
<i>SO FAR, YOU'VE BEEN</i>
<i>REALLY DELICATE</i>

384
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:57,736
<i>ABOUT ISSUES,</i>
<i>YOU KNOW?</i>

385
00:18:57,736 --> 00:19:00,739
<i>I MEAN, SOMETIMES THEY USE THE
WORD "ISSUES" MEANING "FATHER"--

<i>"HE IS THE ISSUE OF SUCH--</i>

00:19:13,752 --> 00:19:15,754

<i>I HEARD OPRAH

UH, YEAH.
OPRAH'S HERE.

394
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:23,262
I HOPE IT DOESN'T, UH,
RUIN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

395
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:27,766
- HI.
- HELLO. THERE'S TWO.

396
00:19:27,766 --> 00:19:30,268
WAIT A SECOND.
HEY, MARK, YOU WANT TO--

397
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:32,271
- HEY, JOE! HEY, LISTEN.
- HI, GUYS.

398
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:34,773
UH, I WANT YOU
TO MEET MY SON MARK-- MARKO.

399
00:19:34,773 --> 00:19:36,775
- THIS IS JOE.
- HI. HOW ARE YOU?

400
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:38,276
NICE TO MEET YOU.

401
00:19:38,277 --> 00:19:43,782
WHAT THIS IS IS EGG WHITES
WITH VEGETABLES AND TOMATOES.

402
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:48,787
THIS IS NOT ON THE MENU.
THIS IS WHAT HE MAKES UP FOR ME.

<i>YOU MAKING THIS FILM--</i>

404
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:54,793
<i>IT CAN BE</i>
<i>A USEFUL PROCESS FOR US,</i>

405
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:58,296
AND IT'S A WEIRD WAY
TO GO THROUGH

406
00:19:58,297 --> 00:20:01,733
A PROCESS, THROUGH A--
THROUGH A MACHINE,

407
00:20:01,733 --> 00:20:04,302
UM, BUT, UH,

408
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,805
ITS A WAY-- IN A WAY
HAS WORKED FOR YOU.

409
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,807
WHEN YOU MADE
THE <i>MATCHMAKER</i> FILM,

410
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,809
<i>UH, YOU WERE GOING</i>
<i>THROUGH A PROCESS.</i>

411
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:14,312
<i>THE FACT THAT IT TURNED OUT</i>
<i>TO BE A GOOD FILM WAS A PLUS.</i>

412

<i>HE'S REFERRING TO</i>
<i>A DOCUMENTARY I MADE IN 1996</i>

413

<i>ABOUT A JEWISH MATCHMAKER AND
HOW SHE COMPLICATED MY DATING LIFE

415
00:20:23,322 --> 00:20:25,627
MOST OF OUR PROBLEMS

416
00:20:25,628 --> 00:20:28,728
START AS OUR RELATIONSHIP

417
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:32,330
<i>WHAT DO YOU THINK, MARK?</i>
<i>DID YOUR MOTHER REJECT YOU?</i>

418
00:20:32,331 --> 00:20:34,833
<i>MY FATHER REJECTED</i> <i>MY MOTHER,</i>

419

<i>AND MY MOTHER THINKS</i>
<i>THAT ALL MEN ARE BEASTS,</i>

420
00:20:37,037 --> 00:20:38,337
<i>AND I DON'T WANT TO BE A BEAST.</i>

421
00:20:38,337 --> 00:20:40,339
<i>I GUESS WHAT I MEANT</i> <i>BY THAT IS,</i>

422
00:20:40,339 --> 00:20:43,342
<i>I DON'T WANT</i>
<i>TO BE MY FATHER.</i>

423
00:20:43,342 --> 00:20:46,845
<i>EVEN WHEN I WAS A CHILD,</i>
<i>I SUSPECTED HE HAD AFFAIRS,</i>

424
00:20:46,845 --> 00:20:49,347
<i>THOUGH HE'D VEHEMENTLY</i>
<i>DENY IT, CALLING ME CRAZY</i>

00:20:49,348 --> 00:20:51,850
<i>FOR EVEN SUGGESTING</i>
<i>SUCH A THING.</i>

426
00:20:51,850 --> 00:20:54,352

430
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,863
<i>THAT AND THE FACT THAT SHE CAME

<i>AND WASN'T A CHILD</i>
<i>OF PRIVILEGE LIKE HIM.</i>

<i>MY MOM IS VERY DOWN-TO-EARTH,</i>

433
00:21:10,172 --> 00:21:12,272
<i>AND THE WHOLE HOLLYWOOD SCENE</i>
<i>NEVER IMPRESSED HER MUCH.</i>

434
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:18,877
<i>MY DAD WOULD OFTEN GO AWAY</i>
<i>ON LOCATION WITH A FILM CREW.</i>

435
00:21:18,877 --> 00:21:22,380
<i>MY MOM NEVER COMPLAINED</i>
<i>ABOUT IT, BUT I GOT THE SENSE</i>

436
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,383
<i>THAT SHE KIND OF</i>
<i>RESENTED IT.</i>

437
00:21:25,884 --> 00:21:30,388
<i>STILL, IT DID GIVE HER TIME</i>
<i>ALONE TO FOCUS ON HER OWN WORK.</i>

438
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:37,896
<i>ULTIMATELY, I GUESS,</i>
<i>THEY LIVED VERY SEPARATE LIVES.</i>

439

451
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:27,445
AND WE'RE THE MAGICIANS,
THE CAMERAMEN.

452

<i>AND EVERYONE CAN FEEL LIKE,

455
00:22:35,954 --> 00:22:39,059

<i>GO AHEAD.</i>

459
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:56,475

00:23:17,496 --> 00:23:19,498
UH-HUH.

464
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:26,004
<i>THAT PHOTO OF ME AND GEORGE

IT SAYS THAT "I'M MARK
AND I'M DIFFERENT FROM YOU".

473
00:23:53,031 --> 00:23:56,534

RATHER THAN GETTING PISSED AT YOU

474

THAT THAT'S FINE, MARK.
YOU CAN BE MARK.

475
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:04,042

CAPTAIN FROM THE <i>AIR FORCE ONE</i>

476
00:24:04,042 --> 00:24:06,044
CALLS YOU
ON THE COMPUTER.

477
00:24:06,044 --> 00:24:09,047
I-I SHARE THAT WITH YOU.
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

478
00:24:09,047 --> 00:24:13,051
AND I DON'T THINK
I'M ANY LESS A LEFTIST

479
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:17,055
FOR FEELING HAPPY
ABOUT SUCH A SITUATION.

480
00:24:17,055 --> 00:24:19,057
IS THIS BEDSIDE READING?

481
00:24:19,057 --> 00:24:21,059
THIS IS MY
BEDSIDE READING.

482
00:24:21,059 --> 00:24:23,061
<i>"WHEN CORPORATIONS</i>
<i>RULE THE WORLD".</i>

483
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,063
- YEAH.
- <i>WOW.</i>

484
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,565
TERRIFIC BOOK.

485
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:30,068
<i>THAT SOUNDS</i>
<i>REALLY ROMANTIC.</i>

486
00:24:30,068 --> 00:24:32,070
UM-- OH, IT IS.
YEAH.

487
00:24:32,070 --> 00:24:35,573
BECAUSE IT SHOWS HOW
CORPORATIONS FUCK PEOPLE.

488
00:24:35,574 --> 00:24:39,077
WELL, YOU KNOW,
HASKELL'S POLITICAL AGENDA

489
00:24:39,077 --> 00:24:41,579
HAS ALWAYS BEEN VERY
IN THE FOREFRONT OF THINGS.

490
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,584
AND THAT HAS MADE HIM
A VERY COLORFUL INDIVIDUAL.

491
00:24:45,584 --> 00:24:49,087
AND A LOT OF THE RUN-INS
I THINK HE'S HAD

492
00:24:49,087 --> 00:24:52,590
UH, HAVE CENTERED AROUND
THAT PARTICULAR ASPECT.

493
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:01,099
<i>I WAS A BIG FAN</i>
<i>OF HASKELL AS A PERSON</i>

494
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:02,600
<i>AND AS A FILMMAKER.</i>

495
00:25:02,601 --> 00:25:07,105
<i>AND I REALLY WANTED US</i>
<i>TO MAKE A PICTURE WITH HIM.</i>

496
00:25:08,607 --> 00:25:12,110
<i>THE EVENTS OF THE LATE '60s</i>
<i>WERE SO INTERESTING</i>

497
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:15,613
<i>THAT IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL</i>
<i>TO BE IN TOUCH WITH FILMMAKERS</i>

498
00:25:15,614 --> 00:25:20,118
<i>WHO WEREN'T INTENT ON
PROPAGATING HOLLYWOOD MYTHS

499
00:25:20,118 --> 00:25:21,421
BUT WERE ACTUALLY

500
00:25:21,422 --> 00:25:23,622
INTERESTED IN MAKING
PICTURES ABOUT THE REAL WORLD.

501
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:27,125
EVERYTHING'S BEEN CLAMPED DOWN
AND HISTORY'S BEEN CHANGED

502
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:30,128
AND REWRITTEN SINCE '68,
SO WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE--

503
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:32,630
<i>WE WERE DISCUSSING</i>
<i>DIFFERENT PROPERTIES</i>

504
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,633
<i>THAT HE MIGHT</i>
<i>UNDERTAKE,</i>

505
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:37,135
<i>AND THERE WAS A BOOK</i>
<i>CALLED</i> THE CONCRETE WILDERNESS

506
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,637
THAT I THOUGHT WOULD BE
AN ARRESTING MOVIE.

507
00:25:39,638 --> 00:25:42,140
AND IT SEEMED LIKE WE WERE
ABOUT TO MAKE THAT MOVIE.

508
00:25:45,143 --> 00:25:47,145
<i>TO PUT IT IN</i>
<i>CLASSIC HOLLYWOOD TALK,</i>

509
00:25:47,145 --> 00:25:49,147
<i>WE GAVE HIM</i>
<i>A DEVELOPMENT DEAL,</i>

510
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:51,149
<i>AND BEING AN ANARCHIST</i>
<i>BY NATURE,</i>

511
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,151
<i>HE DERAILED IT AND CAME UP</i>
<i>WITH A BETTER IDEA.</i>

512
00:25:57,656 --> 00:26:00,659
MEDIUM COOL <i>HAS MANY THEMES.</i>

513
00:26:00,659 --> 00:26:03,161
<i>THE MAIN THEME HAD TO DO</i>
<i>WITH CONSCIENCE,</i>

514
00:26:03,161 --> 00:26:07,165
<i>BECAUSE IT RAISED</i>
<i>MORAL ISSUES--</i>

515
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:10,168
<i>ISSUES OF RELATIONSHIP</i>
<i>TO THE MEDIA;</i>

516
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:14,672
THOUGHTS ABOUT WHEN
YOU PUT THE CAMERA DOWN

517
00:26:14,673 --> 00:26:17,175
<i>AND-AND-AND</i>
<i>BECOME A PARTICIPANT</i>

518
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:19,677
<i>OR WHEN YOU SHOULD</i>
<i>BE A VIEWER.</i>

519
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,682
<i>I'M VERY PROUD</i>
<i>OF THE FILM.</i>

520
00:26:23,682 --> 00:26:25,183
<i>I'M VERY PROUD</i>
<i>OF THE FILM.</i>

521
00:26:27,686 --> 00:26:29,688
<i>WHEN DID YOU SEE</i> MEDIUM COOL?

522
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:33,191
I'VE NEVER SEEN <i>MEDIUM COOL,</i>
BUT I COLLECT MOVIE MEMORABILIA

523
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:34,594
SO I KNEW WHEN I SPOTTED THIS
AT A TRADE SHOW

524
00:26:34,595 --> 00:26:36,195
THAT IT WAS KIND OF A RARE FILM

525
00:26:36,294 --> 00:26:39,197
TO GET A POSTER ON,
SO I SCOOPED IT RIGHT UP.

526
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:43,201
<i>THE MIXTURE OF FICTION
AND SO-CALLED REALITY</i>

527
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:45,203
<i>IS INHERENT IN</i> MEDIUM COOL.

528
00:26:47,205 --> 00:26:50,208
<i>I THOUGHT</i> MEDIUM COOL
<i>WAS ONE OF THE MORE</i>

529
00:26:50,208 --> 00:26:54,212
<i>ACCURATE WAYS TO LOOK AT</i>
<i>THAT SUMMER IN CHICAGO</i>

530
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:58,716
<i>WITH THE CLOUDS OF PROTEST AND
GATHERING IN THE BACKGROUND

531
00:26:58,717 --> 00:27:01,219
<i>AS THESE PEOPLE</i>
<i>IN THE FOREGROUND</i>

532
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:04,222
YOU KNOW, TRIED TO
LEAD THEIR LIVES.

533
00:27:04,222 --> 00:27:06,224
<i>FUCK YOU!</i>

534
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:09,727
IT'S A DOCUMENTARY FILM,
AND YET IT IS NOT.

535
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:11,032
IT IS DOCUMENTARY,

536
00:27:11,033 --> 00:27:14,233
AND YET THERE ARE
A FEW ACTORS IN IT KEEPING IT GOING.

537
00:27:16,735 --> 00:27:21,239
<i>THERE IS SOMETHING ABOUT
WHEN YOU'RE NOT YOURSELF,</i>

538
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:23,741
<i>WHEN YOU'RE ANOTHER PERSON</i>
<i>AND THERE ARE CAMERAS AROUND.</i>

539
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:28,747
<i>EVEN THOUGH YOU KNOW WHAT IS</i>
<i>IN THE BACKGROUND IS REAL,</i>

540
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:32,250
<i>THE SITUATION</i>
<i>THAT YOU'RE IN</i> <i>IS MAKE-BELIEVE.</i>

541
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:35,253
AND SO YOU HAVE A FALSE
SENSE OF SECURITY.

542
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:41,259
<i>THERE WAS ONE SCENE</i>
<i>WHEN HASKELL WANTED ME</i>

543
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:43,761
<i>TO GO UP TO</i>
<i>A POLICE OFFICER</i>

544
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:45,764
<i>AND ASK HIM FOR HELP</i>

545
00:27:45,764 --> 00:27:48,767
<i>TO FIND MY-MY CHILD.</i>

546
00:27:48,767 --> 00:27:51,770
<i>AND WE WANTED TO SEE</i>
<i>HOW I WOULD BE TREATED.</i>

547
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:55,273
<i>SIG HEIL!</i> <i>SIG HEIL! SIG HEIL!</i>

548
00:27:55,273 --> 00:27:57,275
<i>NO MORE WAR!</i>

549
00:27:57,275 --> 00:27:59,277
<i>ACTUALLY, IT WAS</i>
<i>A LITTLE DISAPPOINTING,</i>

550
00:27:59,277 --> 00:28:01,779
<i>BECAUSE HE DIDN'T DO</i>
<i>ANYTHING TO ME</i>

551
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:04,282
<i>FOR ME TO REACT OFF OF.</i>

552
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:07,785
<i>JOIN US! JOIN US!

553
00:28:07,786 --> 00:28:11,790
<i>FIRST OF ALL, THE RIOTS</i>
<i>WERE WRITTEN INTO THE SCRIPT</i>

554
00:28:11,790 --> 00:28:13,792
BEFORE THEY EVER HAPPENED.

555
00:28:19,798 --> 00:28:22,300
<i>I WAS PART OF</i> <i>THE ANTI-WAR MOVEMENT,</i>

556
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,802
<i>AND I KNEW THE ANTI-WAR</i>
<i>MOVEMENT WAS PLANNING</i>

557
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:27,806
TO BE IN CHICAGO
AT THAT TIME.

558
00:28:27,806 --> 00:28:31,309
SO I INCORPORATED THAT
IN THE SCRIPT.

559
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,311
AND THEN COMES
THE BIG ONE.

560
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:36,314
<i>WHEN WE HEAR A VOICE,</i>

561
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:39,817
<i>ONE OF HASKELL'S COLLEAGUES,</i>
<i>THE CO-PRODUCER, JONATHAN HAZE.</i>

562
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:41,820
<i>LOOK OUT, HASKELL!</i> <i>IT'S REAL!</i>

563
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:44,322
<i>AND HASKELL GETS</i> <i>THE TEAR GAS.</i>

564
00:28:44,322 --> 00:28:47,825
<i>HE'S IN IT,</i>
<i>DON'T YOU SEE?</i>

565
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:51,329
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

566
00:28:51,329 --> 00:28:53,831
<i>DURING THE, UH,</i>
<i>WHAT THE GOVERNMENT</i>

567
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:56,334
<i>LATER CALLED</i>
<i>A POLICE RIOT,</i>

568
00:28:56,334 --> 00:29:01,339
<i>I WAS ACCUSED BY THE F.B.I.</i>
<i>OF STARTING DISTURBANCES</i> <i>AND RIOTS</i>

569
00:29:01,339 --> 00:29:03,841
FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE FEATURE
FILM, 'CAUSE THE FILM WAS--

570
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:08,847
I WISHED I HAD
THAT POWER.

571
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:11,850
<i>...RUNNING IN ALL DIRECTIONS</i>

572
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:13,852
<i>AND PLENTY OF THINGS</i>
<i>ARE BEING THROWN.</i>

573
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:17,355
<i>THEN THE LAST SHOT,</i> <i>WHERE YOU SEE</i>

574
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:20,358
<i>THE CAMERAMAN'S CAR</i>
<i>BURNING</i>

575
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:23,361
<i>AND A LITTLE TOURIST CAR</i>
<i>GOES BY WITH A KID</i>

576
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,863
<i>WITH A FLASH CAMERA,</i>

577
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:27,866
<i>AND THEY TAKE A PICTURE.</i>

578
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:31,369
<i>RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE ENTIRE</i>
<i>NATION THIS IS HAPPENING.</i>

579
00:29:31,369 --> 00:29:33,871
<i>THEN THE CAMERA PULLS BACK</i>

580
00:29:33,872 --> 00:29:37,375
<i>AND PANS OVER TO ME</i>
<i>ON MY CAMERA.</i>

581
00:29:37,375 --> 00:29:41,879
<i>...SEEING THESE PEOPLE BEING</i>
<i>DRAGGED INTO THE POLICE WAGON.</i>

582
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,883
<i>WHAT I WAS TRYING</i>
<i>TO SAY IS THAT</i>

583
00:29:44,883 --> 00:29:49,387
<i>EVERYBODY IS</i>
<i>IN SOMEBODY'S MOVIE.</i>

584
00:29:49,387 --> 00:29:51,889
<i>BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY,</i>
<i>THERE'S ANOTHER LEVEL</i>

585
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:54,392
<i>OF REALITY GOING ON.</i>

586
00:29:54,392 --> 00:29:56,394
AND SO WHAT I WAS SAYING,
IN A SENSE, IS,

587
00:29:56,394 --> 00:29:59,397
DON'T NECESSARILY
BELIEVE ME.

588
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,901
<i>CERTAINLY WHEN THE CAMERA'S</i>
<i>POINTING AT US,</i>

589
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,904
<i>I DON'T CARE HOW NORMAL</i>
<i>YOU TRY TO BE,</i>

590
00:30:05,904 --> 00:30:09,407
<i>WE TRY TO PRESENT OURSELVES</i>
<i>IN A CERTAIN WAY.</i>

591
00:30:09,407 --> 00:30:10,510
<i>DOES THAT MEAN</i>
<i>YOU'RE TRYING TO</i>

592
00:30:10,511 --> 00:30:12,311
<i>PRESENT YOURSELF IN A CERTAIN WAY?

593
00:30:12,410 --> 00:30:15,413
<i>I'M DEFINITELY TRYING TO
PRESENT MYSELF IN A CERTAIN WAY.

594
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:18,916
<i>IT'S PART OF</i>
<i>THE SOCIALIZING PROCESS.</i>

595
00:30:18,917 --> 00:30:21,920
IT'S PART OF, UH--
PART OF LIFE.

596
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,922
<i>SO YOU'RE--</i>
<i>YOU'RE ACTING TOO?</i>

597
00:30:23,922 --> 00:30:26,424
ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY.

598
00:30:26,424 --> 00:30:29,427
<i>SO WHEN ARE PEOPLE</i>
<i>NOT ACTING?</i>

599
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:33,431
IT'S HARD FOR A PERSON
WHO ISN'T AN ACTOR BY PROFESSION,

600
00:30:33,431 --> 00:30:36,934
YOU KNOW,
TO KEEP PERFORMING AS AN ACTOR.

601
00:30:36,935 --> 00:30:40,939
AND, UH, THERE WILL BE
MOMENTS, MANY OF THEM,

602
00:30:40,939 --> 00:30:45,443
WHERE HE WILL AUTOMATICALLY
PUT DOWN THAT ROLE

603
00:30:45,443 --> 00:30:49,447
AND, UH--
AND JUST BE HIMSELF.

604
00:30:50,949 --> 00:30:53,451
<i>ARE YOU GOING TO</i> <i>TALK TO CONRAD?</i>

605
00:30:53,451 --> 00:30:54,952
<i>I'M INTERVIEWING HIM</i> <i>ON TUESDAY.</i>

606
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:57,956
TAKE THIS WITH.
I LIKE THE PICTURE.

607
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,958
<i>SO CAN YOU</i>
<i>TELL ME ANY-- ANY--</i>

608
00:30:59,958 --> 00:31:03,461
<i>WHAT KINDS OF THINGS</i>
<i>SHOULD I ASK CONRAD?</i>

609
00:31:03,461 --> 00:31:05,463
<i>ANY STORIES?</i>

610
00:31:05,463 --> 00:31:07,965
ASK HIM ABOUT
THE WEXLER-HALL DAYS, I THINK.

611
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:10,969
<i>YOUR FATHER AND I</i>
<i>HAVE KNOWN EACH OTHER</i>

612
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:13,972
<i>EVER SINCE, UH,</i>
<i>THE EARLY '50s.</i>

613
00:31:13,972 --> 00:31:17,976
HASKELL AND I STARTED
A COMPANY IN 1976,

614
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:20,478
WHICH WE NAMED WEXLER-HALL

615
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:24,482
<i>TO BE ABLE TO EARN MONEY</i>
<i>MAKING COMMERCIALS.</i>

616
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:25,983
IT'S MILLER TIME.

617
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,986
<i>THE WAY I FIGURED</i> <i>IT OUT IS THAT</i>

618
00:31:27,986 --> 00:31:30,488
<i>THE CORPORATIONS ARE</i>
<i>TAKING IT AWAY FROM YOU,</i> <i>YOU KNOW.</i>

619
00:31:30,488 --> 00:31:34,492
<i>AND THIS IS A WAY OF</i>
<i>TAKING IT BACK FROM THEM.</i>

620
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:39,997
HASKELL IS THE FIGHTER BETWEEN
THE TWO OF US, AND I'M THE LOVER.

621
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:42,500
<i>I'M NOT CONFRONTATIONAL.</i>

622
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,705
<i>I'M SOMEBODY THAT</i>
<i>DOESN'T TAKE ARMS</i>

623
00:31:45,706 --> 00:31:48,006
<i>AGAINST A SEA OF TROUBLE THAT WAY.</i>

624
00:31:48,006 --> 00:31:51,009
I REMEMBER HASKELL WAS VERY
POLITICAL IN THOSE DAYS,

625
00:31:51,009 --> 00:31:54,512
AND MY FATHER WASN'T
AND HAS NEVER BEEN VERY POLITICAL.

626
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:58,015
<i>YOU KNOW, I LOVE</i>
<i>THE IDEA OF THIS</i>

627
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:00,018
<i>KIND OF MARRIAGE</i>
<i>BETWEEN OUR DADS.</i>

628
00:32:00,018 --> 00:32:02,822
I ALWAYS FELT FROM YOUR DAD
GROWING UP THIS WARMTH

629
00:32:02,823 --> 00:32:04,423
AND THIS KINDNESS AND THIS HUMOR--

630
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:09,527
LIGHTNESS THAT MY DAD DIDN'T
REALLY HAVE OR DIDN'T SHOW ME.

631
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,031
<i>IT WAS ALWAYS SUCH
A RELIEF TO BE AROUND HIM</i>

632
00:32:14,032 --> 00:32:16,034
<i>'CAUSE HE WAS ALWAYS SO--</i>

633
00:32:16,034 --> 00:32:18,037
EVEN WEXLER-HALL, I'D COME IN
AND HE WAS SO WELCOMING

634
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:18,938
AND CHATTING AND--

635
00:32:19,037 --> 00:32:22,040
YOU KNOW, JUST--
HE SAW THINGS AS, YOU KNOW,

636
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,042
THEY JUST KIND OF
FLEW OVER HIM,

637
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:26,245
AND MY DAD WAS, LIKE,
ALWAYS UP AGAINST SOMEBODY

638
00:32:26,246 --> 00:32:27,446
AND, LIKE, FIGHTING--

639
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:30,047
<i>ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE</i>
<i>ALWAYS ADMIRED ABOUT HASKELL</i>

640
00:32:30,048 --> 00:32:32,050
IS HE GETS UP
EVERY SINGLE MORNING

641
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:35,053
AND HE RANTS AGAINST
THE INJUSTICE IN THE WORLD.

642
00:32:35,053 --> 00:32:38,056
<i>THE</i> VATICAN JOURNAL <i>SAID THAT</i>

643
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:40,058
<i>THE U.S. JUSTIFICATION</i>
<i>FOR THE WAR</i>

644
00:32:40,058 --> 00:32:43,561
HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH WHAT THEY SAY IT IS.

645
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:46,063
IT HAS TO DO WITH ECONOMICS.
IT HAS TO DO WITH OIL.

646
00:32:46,064 --> 00:32:48,066
<i>I ADMIRE THAT BECAUSE</i>

647
00:32:48,066 --> 00:32:51,069
IT MEANS THAT YOU'RE
NOT COMPLACENT.

648
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:55,573
AND EVEN THOUGH AT 80 YEARS OLD
YOU'VE SEEN EVERYTHING

649
00:32:55,573 --> 00:32:58,075
<i>AND YOU SEE IT OVER</i>
<i>AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN,</i>

650
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:00,578
<i>HE NEVER STOPS RANTING.</i>

651
00:33:00,578 --> 00:33:04,582
<i>DAD, I WANT TO ASK ONE--
MAKE ONE SUGGESTION.</i>

652
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:06,083
<i>WHAT?</i>

653
00:33:06,084 --> 00:33:09,587
<i>THE TWO OF US DON'T TALK
ANY POLITICS DURING THE TRIP.</i>

654
00:33:09,587 --> 00:33:12,089
NO. IF YOU'RE MAKING
A DOCUMENTARY

655
00:33:12,090 --> 00:33:14,592
WHERE I'M
THE MAIN CHARACTER,

656
00:33:14,592 --> 00:33:17,094
YOU'D BETTER BE SURE
THAT I'M GONNA TALK POLITICS

657
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:20,598
BECAUSE, UM, AFTER ALL,

658
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:23,100
YOU KNOW, WE ARE GOING TO
AN ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATION,

659
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:27,105
<i>WHICH COULD INDEED</i>
<i>MAKE ME SUSPECT ABOUT</i>

660
00:33:27,105 --> 00:33:29,607
WHAT THIS
DOCUMENTARY'S ABOUT.

661
00:33:29,607 --> 00:33:32,511
AM I GONNA BE GOING
TO AN ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATION

662
00:33:32,512 --> 00:33:34,112
TO BE MADE FUN OF?

663
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:37,615
<i>NO. YOU CAN TELL ME.</i>
<i>I JUST MAY NOT REACT, BECAUSE--</i>

664
00:33:37,615 --> 00:33:40,117
NO, I DON'T WANT YOUR--
YOU DON'T HAVE TO REACT.

665
00:33:40,118 --> 00:33:42,120
I MEAN,
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS,

666
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,622
YOU WANT TO BE
THE JOURNALIST.

667
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:49,126
I ASSUME THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE
SAYING. THAT YOU WANT TO JUST, UM,

668
00:33:49,127 --> 00:33:51,629
OBSERVE.

669
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:56,537
<i>I HAVEN'T BEEN</i>
<i>TO A PEACE DEMONSTRATION</i>

670
00:33:56,538 --> 00:33:59,038
<i>WITH MY DAD SINCE 1967.</i>

671
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:02,041

675
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:17,155

00:34:17,155 --> 00:34:21,659
TO PAY FOR THIS GAS
AS MY CONTRIBUTION,

677
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:25,162
UH, TOWARDS THIS TRIP

678
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:39,177

MARK? <i>-I'VE BEEN GETTING IT.</i>
<i>I'VE BEEN GETTING IT.</i>

00:34:48,186 --> 00:34:51,189
THEY'RE ALL GOING UP
TO THE PEACE MARCH.

682
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:54,192
<i>THERE'S YOUR SOLDIERS</i> <i>WHO ARE BEING</i>

683

TO GO TO WAR

685
00:34:58,696 --> 00:35:01,198
TO, UH, DEFEND, UM--

686
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,701

687
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:08,205
<i>I JUST KNOW IN

691
00:35:15,213 --> 00:35:17,215
<i>SO I'D RATHER NOT</i>
<i>GET INTO IT.</i>

692
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:19,217
I WANT YOU,
AS A DOCUMENTARIAN,

693
00:35:19,217 --> 00:35:21,219
EVEN THOUGH
YOU ARE MY SON,

694
00:35:21,219 --> 00:35:23,721
TO REFLECT...

695
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:28,225
WHAT I BELIEVE
AND WHAT I SAY.

696
00:35:28,226 --> 00:35:31,229
NOW, YOU CAN MAKE
YOUR COMMENTS ON 'EM,

697
00:35:31,229 --> 00:35:35,733
BUT TO, UM--
TO GO IN AND BE THE PRIME ACTOR

00:35:35,733 --> 00:35:39,236
IN YOUR--

699
00:35:39,237 --> 00:35:42,740

WHICH YOU WILL THEN
ADJUST TO FIT YOUR VIEW--

00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:51,749

WANT TO HAVE TO BE ON GUARD ABOUT.

702
00:35:58,256 --> 00:36:01,759
<i>THERE IT IS--</i> <i>SAN FRANCISCO.</i>

703
00:36:01,759 --> 00:36:04,762

I'M FUCKED.

704

<i>onto U.S. 101 North.</i>

707
00:36:14,772 --> 00:36:18,776
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU AND ME
MARCHED AGAINST THE VIETNAM WAR--

708
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:21,278
AND I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE
TOLD YOU THIS BEFORE-- ALL OF US--

709
00:36:21,279 --> 00:36:24,282
ALL OF US FELT THAT

710
00:36:24,282 --> 00:36:29,287
AFTER MARCHING 50, 60 TIMES,
NOBODY'S LISTENING.

711
00:36:29,287 --> 00:36:31,289
THEY'RE GONNA DO
WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO ANYWAY.

712
00:36:33,291 --> 00:36:34,292
<i>HE DID TELL ME,</i> <i>AND HE TOLD ME</i>

713
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:37,295
<i>OVER AND OVER AGAIN.</i>

714
00:36:37,295 --> 00:36:40,298
<i>OUR BREAKFAST-TABLE CONVERSATION

<i>OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.</i>

717

<i>MY MOM AND I WEREN'T</i>

<i>SEEM TO NOTICE.</i>

720
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:54,812
SO WE'LL SEE WHAT
THE DEMONSTRATION IS TODAY.

721
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:58,315
NOW, MARK, IF YOU CUT OUT
ALL THIS POLITICAL TALK

722
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:00,818
BECAUSE YOU DON'T AGREE
WITH ME, I'LL BE PISSED.

723
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:03,320
I WILL BE PISSED
FROM MY CAN OF DUST

724
00:37:03,321 --> 00:37:05,323
WHICH WILL BE DUMPED
INTO THE OCEAN.

725
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:07,825
SO YOU CAN'T GET AWAY FROM ME.
IT'D BETTER BE IN,

726
00:37:07,825 --> 00:37:11,328
WE NEED
A HIGH ANGLE.

727
00:37:11,329 --> 00:37:14,533
<i>IT SAYS HERE,

734
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:33,851
WELL, I GUESS THAT'S US--
THE SOLID MIDDLE CLASS.

YOU'RE RONNIE GILBERT?

736
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:59,078
I RECOGNIZE RONNIE GILBERT

VERY IMPORTANT TO TELL ME

753

763
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:16,954
OUTSIDE? LOOK. WHAT I HAVE TO SAY
IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE IMAGE,

764
00:39:16,954 --> 00:39:18,956
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET
AS GOOD A SOUND OUTSIDE.

765
00:39:18,956 --> 00:39:20,958

00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:44,541
THEN I TRULY--
I TRULY PUT YOUR, UM--

795
00:40:44,542 --> 00:40:47,545
I TRULY PUT WHY WE'RE MAKING
THIS FILM INTO QUESTION.

796
00:40:47,545 --> 00:40:50,548
<i>DAD, I CAME</i>
<i>RIGHT OVER, DIDN'T I?</i>

797
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:53,551
<i>I JUST WANT TO GET THE SUN</i>
<i>SETTING WITH YOU OUTSIDE.</i>

798
00:40:53,551 --> 00:40:54,754
BULLSHIT WITH THE SUNSET!

799
00:40:54,755 --> 00:40:56,455
ISN'T THAT A FUCKING
MILLER BEER COMMERCIAL?

800
00:40:56,554 --> 00:41:00,057
IT'S YOUR FATHER TALKING ABOUT
SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT TO HIM.

801
00:41:03,561 --> 00:41:05,064
YOU WANT TO TAKE THE SUNSET?

802
00:41:05,065 --> 00:41:06,965
TAKE YOUR FUCKING
CAMERA, TAKE A PICTURE OF IT

803
00:41:07,064 --> 00:41:09,066
AND THEN CUT IT
IN YOUR MOVIE.

804
00:41:09,066 --> 00:41:11,068
<i>BUT I GET A LOT</i>
<i>OF YOU SITTING DOWN</i> <i>IN A ROOM.</i>

805
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:14,071
<i>THIS WOULD BE YOU STANDING UP
AND--</i> -WHAT'S IMPORTANT HERE

806
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:18,075
IS THAT I, THE STAR
OF YOUR FUCKING MOVIE,

807
00:41:18,075 --> 00:41:20,077
DESPERATELY WANT
TO SAY SOMETHING

808
00:41:20,077 --> 00:41:22,579
ABOUT WHAT TODAY
HAS MEANT TO ME

809
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:25,884
AND WHY I WENT UP HERE
TO SAN FRANCISCO WITH YOU

810
00:41:25,885 --> 00:41:26,985
TO THIS PEACE MARCH.

811
00:41:27,084 --> 00:41:29,586
OKAY? NOW, IF THAT'S
NOT IMPORTANT TO YOU

812
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:32,089
OR IF THAT'S IN BALANCE
IMPORTANT TO YOU

813
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:34,591
WITH THE SHOT
OF THE FUCKING SUNSET,

814
00:41:34,592 --> 00:41:38,596
THEN I MIGHT AS WELL
HANG UP MY JOCK STRAP, YOU KNOW?

815
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:47,104
<i>EVER SINCE GETTING BACK</i>
<i>FROM THE PEACE MARCH,</i>

816
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:51,108
<i>MY DAD'S BEEN A BIT MORE RELUCTANT
TO BRING UP PERSONAL THINGS.

817
00:41:51,108 --> 00:41:53,610
<i>MAYBE OUR ARGUMENT</i>
<i>IN SAN FRANCISCO</i> <i>IS TO BLAME,</i>

818
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:56,113
<i>OR MAYBE HE FEELS THAT</i>
<i>BY MAKING THIS DOCUMENTARY,</i>

819
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:58,615
<i>I'M TRESPASSING</i>
<i>ON HIS TERRITORY.</i>

820
00:41:58,616 --> 00:42:01,619
<i>AFTER ALL,</i>
<i>FOR THE LONGEST TIME,</i>

821
00:42:01,619 --> 00:42:04,622
<i>THERE WAS ROOM FOR ONLY
ONE FILMMAKER IN OUR FAMILY.

822
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:12,129
<i>HE'S AGREED TO BE INTERVIEWED</i>
<i>FOR A BIOGRAPHY</i> <i>ON STEVE McQUEEN,</i>

823
00:42:12,129 --> 00:42:15,632
<i>BUT HE'S POSTPONED A NUMBER</i>
<i>OF ONE-ON-ONES WITH ME.</i>

824
00:42:15,633 --> 00:42:19,136
<i>I HOPE I HAVEN'T</i>
<i>CAUSED HIM TO CLAM UP.</i>

825
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:22,139
<i>ANY PSYCHOLOGIST</i> <i>WILL TELL YOU</i>

826
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:25,142
<i>THAT THE STRONGER</i>
<i>OF THE TWO INSTINCTS</i> <i>TO DISCLOSE</i>

827
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:27,144
<i>OR TO KEEP A SECRET,</i>

828
00:42:27,144 --> 00:42:30,647
<i>THE INSTINCT TO DISCLOSE--</i>
<i>THAT'S THE STRONGER ONE.</i>

829
00:42:30,648 --> 00:42:34,151
<i>PEOPLE WOULD</i>
<i>MUCH RATHER OPEN UP.</i>

830
00:42:34,151 --> 00:42:38,155
<i>THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES</i>
<i>IN GETTING CLOSE</i> <i>TO YOUR FATHER</i>

831
00:42:38,155 --> 00:42:40,657
<i>THAT YOU MAY NOT</i>
<i>HAVE THOUGHT OF</i>

832
00:42:40,658 --> 00:42:43,160
THAT YOU SHOULD
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF.

833
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,672
"PERSONAL RELEASE.

834
00:42:54,672 --> 00:42:56,674
<i>TELL THEM WHO YOU ARE".</i>

835
00:42:56,674 --> 00:42:59,176
WHO IS THIS? -<i>IT'S A
RELEASE FORM FOR YOU TO SIGN.</i>

836
00:43:04,181 --> 00:43:07,184
<i>I DON'T THINK</i> <i>I'M GONNA SIGN THIS.</i>

837
00:43:07,184 --> 00:43:09,186
<i>I CAN'T MAKE</i>
<i>THE MOVIE WITHOUT IT.</i>

838
00:43:09,186 --> 00:43:11,188
YEAH, BUT I'M THE SUBJECT
OF THIS GODDAMN THING.

839
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:14,691
<i>I KNOW. THE SUBJECT IS THE MAIN
PERSON WHO'S GOT TO SIGN IT.

840
00:43:14,692 --> 00:43:16,694
I'M NOT GONNA SIGN
TILL I SEE THE MOVIE.

841
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:20,698
<i>YOU CAN'T DO THAT.</i>
<i>I WON'T ALLOW IT. BUT--</i>

842
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:23,200
I WON'T!
WHAT IF YOU MAKE A--

843
00:43:23,200 --> 00:43:27,704
WHAT IF YOU MAKE A FILM
THAT'S-- THAT I FIND INSULTING?

844
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:29,707
<i>YOU GOTTA</i>
<i>TRUST ME.</i>

845
00:43:29,707 --> 00:43:33,210
NO, I'M SORRY.

846
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:35,712
- BUT, UH--
- HERE. HERE. JUST SIGN.

847
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:37,715
RIGHT THERE.

848
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:44,221
<i>YOUR ASSOCIATION</i> <i>WITH YOUR FATHER</i>

849
00:43:44,221 --> 00:43:48,725
<i>IS ONE OF AN IMAGE</i>
<i>FROM CHILDHOOD UP</i>

850
00:43:48,726 --> 00:43:52,229
OF WHO YOUR FATHER--
HE'S YOUR <i>FATHER.</i>

851
00:43:52,229 --> 00:43:54,731
HE'S NOT A PERSON.

852
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:56,536
<i>HE PROBABLY KNOWS IT ALL AND--</i>

853
00:43:56,537 --> 00:43:58,637
<i>I MEAN, YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT A CHILD GROWING UP.</i>

854
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:03,240
YOU BRING TO FATHERHOOD
WHO YOU ARE.

855
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,045
IF YOU'RE COMPLEX,

856
00:44:05,046 --> 00:44:08,746
THERE'LL BE SOME COMPLEXITY
IN YOUR "FATHERHOOD-NESS".

857
00:44:08,746 --> 00:44:12,750
<i>YOU WILL BE VERY COMPASSIONATE</i>
<i>WITH YOUR CHILDREN.</i>

858
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,753
<i>YOU'LL BE TOO STRICT</i>
<i>SOMETIMES</i>

859
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:18,756
<i>AND NOT STRICT ENOUGH</i>
<i>AT OTHER TIMES.</i>

860
00:44:18,756 --> 00:44:20,758
IT'S A DIMENSIONAL THING.

861
00:44:20,758 --> 00:44:23,062
WE HAVE TO IDENTIFY OURSELVES.

862
00:44:23,063 --> 00:44:25,163
I THINK THAT'S THE
REAL PURPOSE OF EGO.

863
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:28,765
<i>BECAUSE IF I CANNOT</i>
<i>IDENTIFY MYSELF,</i>

864
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:31,268
<i>IN MY OWN TERMS,</i>

865
00:44:31,268 --> 00:44:35,272
<i>THEN I'M FORCED TO ACCEPT</i>
<i>YOUR IDENTIFYING ME.</i>

866
00:44:35,272 --> 00:44:37,774
<i>DAD, I HAVE SOMETHING--</i>
<i>SOME NEWS TO TELL YOU.</i>

867
00:44:37,775 --> 00:44:41,278
<i>YOU KNOW HOW I DID</i> AIR FORCE
ONE <i>FOR</i> <i>NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC</i>

868
00:44:41,278 --> 00:44:44,281
- <i>FOR TELEVISION?</i>
- YES.

869
00:44:44,281 --> 00:44:47,284
<i>THE WHITE HOUSE HAS JUST APPROVED
ME TO FLY WITH PRESIDENT BUSH

870
00:44:47,284 --> 00:44:50,787
<i>FOR</i> SMITHSONIAN <i>MAGAZINE TO DO
A STILL STORY OF</i> AIR FORCE ONE.

871
00:44:50,788 --> 00:44:54,792
OH, HOW GREAT. <i>-SO I'M GONNA BE
FLYING WITH OUR PRESIDENT.</i>

872
00:44:54,792 --> 00:44:56,096
OH, GREAT.

873
00:44:56,097 --> 00:44:59,197
SO WHEN THE TERRORISTS START
BOMBING THINGS AND SO FORTH,

874
00:44:59,296 --> 00:45:02,299
AT LEAST YOU'LL BE PROBABLY
THE SAFEST PLACE IN THE WORLD,

875
00:45:02,299 --> 00:45:05,802
BECAUSE YOU CAN BE SURE
THAT THEY'RE GONNA, UH,

876
00:45:05,803 --> 00:45:10,808
MAKE SURE THAT OUR, UM,
UNELECTED PRESIDENT IS SAFE, SO--

877
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:15,813
<i>ALTHOUGH I NEVER INTENDED TO
FOLLOW IN MY FATHER'S FOOTSTEPS,</i>

878
00:45:15,813 --> 00:45:18,816
<i>I TOO PICKED UP A CAMERA</i>
<i>AT AN EARLY AGE.</i>

879
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:21,321
<i>IT ALLOWED ME TO SEE THE WORLD

880
00:45:21,322 --> 00:45:24,222
<i>BUT BE SHIELDED FROM IT
THROUGH THE LENS.

881
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:26,823
<i>TO GET OUT OF WRITING
RESEARCH PAPERS IN HIGH SCHOOL,

882
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:28,528
<i>I WOULD OFTEN
CONVINCE MY TEACHERS

883
00:45:28,529 --> 00:45:30,729
<i>TO ALLOW ME TO HAND IN
PHOTO ASSIGNMENTS.

884
00:45:30,828 --> 00:45:33,330
<i>I EVENTUALLY BECAME</i>
<i>A PHOTOJOURNALIST,</i>

885
00:45:33,330 --> 00:45:36,333
<i>AND EVEN THOUGH MY FATHER
AND I USED CAMERAS FOR A LIVING,

886
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:40,337
<i>I STILL THOUGHT OF OUR
PROFESSIONS AS DIFFERENT ENOUGH.

887
00:45:40,337 --> 00:45:44,841
<i>MY FATHER ALWAYS PRESENTED
HIMSELF AS THE ULTIMATE AUTHORITY.

888
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:47,344
<i>BUT WHEN I FOUND OUT THAT</i>
<i>THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT</i>

889
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:51,348
<i>WAS ACTUALLY MIGHTIER</i>
<i>THAN HASKELL WEXLER,</i> <i>I EMBRACED IT.</i>

890
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,252
<i>IT'S HARD TO SAY WHETHER</i>
<i>I INITIALLY DID THIS</i>

891
00:45:53,253 --> 00:45:55,253
<i>TO SEPARATE MYSELF FROM HIM</i>

892
00:45:55,352 --> 00:45:58,855
<i>OR BECAUSE I REALLY FAVORED</i>
<i>THE OPPOSING SIDE.</i>

893
00:45:58,856 --> 00:46:01,859
<i>WHEN I KNEW YOU, YOU WERE
A TEENAGER IN HIGH SCHOOL,</i>

894
00:46:01,859 --> 00:46:03,863
<i>AND YOU WERE RIDING
AROUND IN COP CARS

895
00:46:03,864 --> 00:46:06,264
<i>WITH GREAT RESPECT FOR THE
GOVERNMENT AND THE F.B.I.,

896
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:08,365
ALL OF YOUR FATHER'S
ENEMIES.

897
00:46:08,365 --> 00:46:11,368
<i>I THINK YOU THOUGHT I WAS
SPYING ON YOU FOR THE F.B.I.</i>

898
00:46:11,368 --> 00:46:14,371
YOU PROBABLY WOULD'VE
IF THEY'D OFFERED YOU THE JOB.

899
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:17,874
THIS, TO HIM,
WAS TERRIBLY PAINFUL--

900
00:46:17,875 --> 00:46:21,378
THAT NOT ONLY
WERE YOU, UH,

901
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:25,882
ADOPTING A POLITICAL POSITION
QUITE CONTRARY TO HIS,

902
00:46:25,883 --> 00:46:27,587
BUT THAT HE WASN'T ABLE

903
00:46:27,588 --> 00:46:29,788
TO COMMUNICATE HIS
OWN VALUES TO YOU.

904
00:46:29,887 --> 00:46:31,091
<i>HE WAS ALWAYS ASKING ME,</i>

905
00:46:31,092 --> 00:46:34,292
<i>"CAN YOU THINK OF
SOMETHING TO CONVINCE MARK?"</i>

906
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:37,894
<i>AND I SAID TO HIM, "LOOK, THIS
IS NOT AN INTELLECTUAL PROBLEM.

907
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:40,898
<i>MARK HAS HIS OWN IDEAS,</i>
<i>AND I DON'T THINK</i> <i>ANYTHING I SAY</i>

908
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:43,901
<i>OR ANY DOCUMENT I SHOW HIM</i>
<i>IS GOING TO SWAY HIM".</i>

909
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:45,402
<i>SO, DAD,</i>
<i>WHERE ARE WE HERE?</i>

910
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:48,405
MARK, I WANTED
TO TELL YOU THAT WE'RE GOING IN

911
00:46:48,405 --> 00:46:52,909
TO DO A LITTLE
PHOTO SHOW--

912
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:55,412
PART OF A DOCUMENTARY--
AT STANLEY SCHEINBAUM'S HOUSE.

913
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:57,414
<i>BUT, DAD,</i>
<i>THIS IS A MEETING</i>

914
00:46:57,414 --> 00:47:00,917
<i>THAT IS</i> AGAINST <i>THINGS</i>
<i>THAT THE GOVERNMENT</i> <i>IS TRYING TO DO</i>

915
00:47:00,918 --> 00:47:02,920
<i>VIS-A-VIS CUBA.</i>

916
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,023
<i>I HAVE TO BE CLEARED AGAIN</i>
<i>TO GO OFF WITH PRESIDENT BUSH</i>

917
00:47:05,024 --> 00:47:06,324
<i>ON THE AIRPLANE,</i>

918
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:09,926
<i>AND IF THERE'S A PROBLEM,</i>
<i>IT COULD BE BECAUSE OF THIS.</i>

919
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,428
<i>I DON'T WANT</i>
<i>TO BE LINKED.</i>

920
00:47:11,428 --> 00:47:13,430
- WAIT, WAIT.
- <i>I DON'T WANT</i> <i>TO BE LINKED.</i>

921
00:47:13,430 --> 00:47:17,434
IN OTHER WORDS, YOU DON'T WANT TO
TAKE YOUR CAMERA INTO ANY PLACE

922
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:22,439
WHICH YOU THINK THAT IF GEORGE
W. BUSH SAW YOU DO THAT,

923
00:47:22,439 --> 00:47:24,441
HE WOULD NOT
GIVE YOU CLEARANCE.

924
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:26,443
AND I'M SAYING,
THAT IS PERVERSION.

925
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:28,945
<i>THAT IS</i>
<i>ADOLF HITLER TALK.</i>

926
00:47:28,946 --> 00:47:30,948
<i>I'M JUST SAYING,</i>

927
00:47:30,948 --> 00:47:33,450
<i>I'D LIKE TO</i>
<i>PLAY IT SAFE.</i>

928
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:35,952
<i>I-I DON'T WANT TO BRING SAUL
INTO THIS. I-I REALLY DON'T.

929
00:47:35,953 --> 00:47:39,456
I DO. IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT.
SHOOT THE SCENE!

930
00:47:39,456 --> 00:47:41,958
YOU GOT A SCENE
INSTEAD OF A TALKING HEAD.

931
00:47:41,959 --> 00:47:45,462
WELL, I THINK IT'S PROBABLY
SAFER FOR YOU NOT TO GO IN, MARK.

932
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:49,966
<i>SO YOU THINK MY CONCERNS
ARE LEGITIMATE?</i>

933
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:52,970
<i>TOTALLY. I THINK</i>
<i>YOU'RE VERY PERCEPTIVE</i>

934
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:56,473
IN THAT WE ARE
IN A PLACE NOW WHERE

935
00:47:56,473 --> 00:48:02,479
SECURITY CONCERNS
HAVE BECOME DOMINANT.

936
00:48:02,479 --> 00:48:06,483
AND THEY'VE CERTAINLY--
HOW SHOULD I SAY IT?

937
00:48:06,483 --> 00:48:10,487
--TAKEN THE--
THE HIGH ROAD,

938
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:13,490
UH, OVER, LET'S SAY,
WHAT WE USED TO THINK OF

939
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:15,992
AS TRADITIONAL RIGHTS
AND LIBERTIES.

940
00:48:15,993 --> 00:48:17,494
I TURNED THIS OFF.

941
00:48:17,494 --> 00:48:19,496
- <i>TURN THAT BACK ON.</i>
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

942
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:22,999
<i>SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO?</i> -LOOKIT.
IT'S NOT "WHAT SHOULD WE DO?"

943
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:25,002
I KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO.
I'M GOING IN THERE

944
00:48:25,002 --> 00:48:27,004
AND FIND OUT
WHAT'S GOING ON.

945
00:48:27,004 --> 00:48:30,507
MAYBE LEARN SOMETHING
AND USE MY CAMERA TO, UH--

946
00:48:30,507 --> 00:48:34,010
IF I LEARN SOMETHING, OTHER
PEOPLE CAN LOOK WHAT I'VE SHOT,

947
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:36,013
AND THEN THEY'LL
LEARN SOMETHING.

948
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:38,015
THAT'S WHAT AMERICA'S
ALL ABOUT.

949
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:40,017
NOW, WHAT NAZI GERMANY
WAS ALL ABOUT,

950
00:48:40,017 --> 00:48:41,518
I CAN'T TELL YOU.

951
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:46,023
I THOUGHT I GAVE HIM
PRETTY GOOD ADVICE.

952
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:48,025
<i>HIS WHOLE FIGHT IN LIFE</i>

953
00:48:48,025 --> 00:48:49,028
<i>IS TO SAY HE'S MORE IMPORTANT</i>

954
00:48:49,029 --> 00:48:50,929
<i>THAN ME, UNDERSTAND?</i>
- <i>UH-HUH.</i>

955
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:54,031
<i>THIS IS THE BACK LOT.</i>

956
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:56,533
<i>AND-AND-AND</i>
<i>TO BE ABLE TO SAY</i>

957
00:48:56,533 --> 00:49:01,037
<i>THAT THE CAPTAIN OF AIR FORCE
ONE CALLS HIM UP, SAYING,</i>

958
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:04,541
<i>"COME ON, FLY ON AIR FORCE ONE
AGAIN WITH BUSH" AND SO FORTH.

959
00:49:04,541 --> 00:49:09,045
<i>BECAUSE HE NEEDS-- HE NEEDS TO SAY
HE'S AS IMPORTANT AS ME. MORE SO.

960
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:13,050
<i>AND WITH</i>
<i>THE OFFICIAL STAMP.</i>

961
00:49:31,568 --> 00:49:35,071
<i>A FEW MORE TIMES.</i>

962
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:37,574
<i>SO HOW'S HE DOING FOR 80?</i>

963
00:49:37,574 --> 00:49:42,078
HOW'S HE DOING FOR 80?
HE'S DOING GREAT FOR <i>60.</i>

964
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:43,580
FOR 80, HE'S DOING SUPER!

965
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:48,084
GOOD JOB. THE WHOLE SCIENCE IS,

966
00:49:48,085 --> 00:49:51,588
MAKE 20 OUT OF TEN,
RIGHT?

967
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:54,591
IT'S LIKE MY DAD SAID--

968
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:57,093
I SHOULD BE A CHEMIST,

969
00:49:57,094 --> 00:50:01,098
'CAUSE I COULD TAKE GOOD MONEY
AND CHANGE IT INTO SHIT.

970
00:50:01,098 --> 00:50:04,601
HOW MANY ROUNDS WE DOING?

971
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:07,103
WE'RE DOING FIVE ROUNDS,
THREE MINUTES EACH. -FIVE?

972
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:09,606
YES!
SURPRISED?

973
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:15,111
<i>SO, COME ON!</i>
<i>TOO MUCH TALK,</i> <i>MOVIE STAR? COME ON!</i>

974
00:50:19,116 --> 00:50:23,120
GOOD JOB, MISTER.
WHO YOU KILL TODAY?

975
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,623
WHO WAS YOUR
IMAGINARY OPPONENT?

976
00:50:26,623 --> 00:50:29,125
AH, I WAS NOT KILLING.

977
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:32,129
I WAS IN SPORTS. SPORTS.

978
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:36,133
I WAS DEFEATING
A VERY NICE GUY

979
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:40,137
WHO, UH, HAD TO KNOW
THAT I WAS A BETTER BOXER.

980
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:45,642
HASKELL, THERE IS
NO "NICE GUY" IN BOXING.

981
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:50,647
<i>WELL, THIS IS ONE</i> <i>OF VICTOR'S SONS.</i>

982
00:50:50,647 --> 00:50:52,649
<i>HE WAS</i>
<i>A CHESS CHAMPION.</i>

983
00:50:52,649 --> 00:50:56,152
NOW, THIS KID'S
NOT ONLY

984
00:50:56,153 --> 00:50:59,156
INTELLECTUALLY ACTIVE,

985
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:02,159
BUT HE INSISTS THEY DO
WHAT HE HAS IN MIND

986
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:04,661
AS FAR AS THEIR-THEIR--
THEIR BODIES,

987
00:51:04,661 --> 00:51:06,663
SO THEY'RE GOOD
IN SPORTS AS WELL.

988
00:51:06,663 --> 00:51:09,165
MAYBE I WOULD HAVE
BEEN A BETTER FATHER

989
00:51:09,166 --> 00:51:12,669
IF I KNEW WHAT I KNOW NOW
WHEN YOU WERE GROWING UP,

990
00:51:12,669 --> 00:51:15,672
SO YOU WOULDN'T
TURN OUT TO BE SUCH A MESS.

991
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:27,684
YEAH, I'M-I'M ROLLING.
OKAY.

992
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:29,087
<i>I GUESS
IT WAS ONLY FAIR</i>

993
00:51:29,088 --> 00:51:31,188
<i>THAT MY FATHER ASK ME
SOME QUESTIONS.</i>

994
00:51:31,188 --> 00:51:34,691
- ALL RIGHT.
- <i>I WAS REALLY CURIOUS</i>

995
00:51:34,691 --> 00:51:37,193
<i>TO FIND OUT WHAT HE WANTED TO
LEARN ABOUT HIS MESSED-UP SON.

996
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:39,696
YOU'RE TALKING TO PEOPLE.
I DON'T KNOW--

997
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:42,198
I DON'T KNOW ALL THE PEOPLE
YOU'RE TALKING TO.

998
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:44,201
UH, I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE ASKING, AND WHAT'S MORE,

999
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:46,703
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE SAYING.

1000
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:51,207
NOW, I ASSUME THAT MOST OF THEM
ARE SAYING GOOD THINGS ABOUT ME.

1001
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:54,211
A GUY COMES THERE
AND HE'S MY SON.

1002
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:57,214
<i>SO, UH, THEY'RE</i>
<i>NOT GONNA, UH--</i>

1003
00:51:57,214 --> 00:51:59,717
<i>IN OTHER WORDS, THEY'RE</i>
<i>NOT GONNA DO THE INTERVIEW</i>

1004
00:51:59,718 --> 00:52:00,618
<i>IF THEY WANT TO SAY THAT</i>

1005
00:52:00,717 --> 00:52:04,721
HASKELL'S A 14-CARAT PRICK
AND, UH,

1006
00:52:04,721 --> 00:52:06,723
WHY ARE YOU MAKING
A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT HIM?

1007
00:52:06,723 --> 00:52:10,727
SO THEN,
HOW MUCH OF WHAT--

1008
00:52:10,727 --> 00:52:13,229
OF WHAT YOU HEAR
FROM PEOPLE SAY

1009
00:52:13,230 --> 00:52:17,234
<i>DO YOU FEEL IS</i>
<i>WHO I AM?</i>

1010
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:22,739
THIS HAS BEEN INTERESTING,
BECAUSE A LOT OF THINGS

1011
00:52:22,739 --> 00:52:24,741
I'VE THOUGHT ABOUT YOU
OVER THE YEARS, IT'S BEEN--

1012
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:29,245
<i>SOME PEOPLE SAY, YOU KNOW--</i>
<i>A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE--</i>

1013
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:32,749
<i>YOU KNOW, MOST PEOPLE HAVE
GREAT RESPECT FOR YOU AND LOVE,

1014
00:52:32,749 --> 00:52:35,251
<i>BUT SOME PEOPLE SAY</i>
<i>YOU'RE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT</i>

1015
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:37,754
<i>AND, UH,</i>
<i>EXTREMELY OPINIONATED.</i>

1016
00:52:37,754 --> 00:52:40,757
GROWING UP, UM,

1017
00:52:40,757 --> 00:52:42,759
I OFTEN FELT

1018
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:45,762
THAT YOU UNDERMINED ME
IN CERTAIN WAYS.

1019
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:49,766
I REMEMBER WHEN
I HAD CERTAIN, UH--

1020
00:52:49,766 --> 00:52:51,570
IF I WERE EXPRESSING
EMOTION OFTEN,

1021
00:52:51,571 --> 00:52:53,671
YOU'D SAY,
"OH, YOU'RE JUST ACTING".

1022
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:56,272
<i>AND, UM--

1023
00:52:56,273 --> 00:52:59,276
OR "YOU'RE STUPID, MARK".

1024
00:52:59,276 --> 00:53:01,278
I REMEMBER HEARING THAT
A LOT WHEN GROWING UP.

1025
00:53:01,278 --> 00:53:03,780
<i>THEN I REMEMBER,</i>
<i>YOU KNOW,</i>

1026
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,282
GROWING UP AND,
AROUND THE DINNER TABLE,

1027
00:53:06,283 --> 00:53:08,387
YOU'D SIT AROUND AND SAY,
"OH, THAT DIRECTOR'S STUPID,

1028
00:53:08,388 --> 00:53:10,188
DOESN'T KNOW WHAT HE'S DOING".

1029
00:53:10,287 --> 00:53:13,290
YOU KNOW WHY
THAT WAS, MARK? <i>-WHY?</i>

1030
00:53:13,290 --> 00:53:15,792
BECAUSE MOSTLY THEY WERE.

1031
00:53:15,792 --> 00:53:17,794
MOSTLY THEY WERE...?

1032
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:19,295
STUPID.

1033
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:26,303
<i>SORRY I'M LATE, DAD.</i>

1034
00:53:26,303 --> 00:53:28,805
<i>WELL, IT'S EARLY</i> <i>IN THE MORNING,</i>

1035
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:33,810
AND I HAVE SORT OF A TENSE
SITUATION FOR ME PERSONALLY,

1036
00:53:33,810 --> 00:53:37,313
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, IN A MONTH
AND A HALF I'M GONNA BE 81.

1037
00:53:37,314 --> 00:53:40,317
I DON'T FEEL 81.
I'VE NOT BEEN WORKING.

1038
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:43,320
AND I HAVE AN INTERVIEW
WITH, UM, A DIRECTOR

1039
00:53:43,320 --> 00:53:47,824
WHO USED TO BE A CAMERAMAN
NAMED BILLE AUGUST.

1040
00:53:47,824 --> 00:53:51,327
LISTEN, I GOTTA DO STUFF
TO GET READY, SO, UH--

1041
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:54,831
<i>I JUST WONDER WHAT</i>
<i>HE'S GONNA THINK ABOUT ME,</i>

1042
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:57,333
ABOUT HIRING ME OR NOT.

1043
00:53:57,334 --> 00:54:01,338
I FEEL LIKE SAYING TO HIM,
"LOOKIT, BILLE,

1044
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:03,840
YOU KNOW I CAN SHOOT.

1045
00:54:03,840 --> 00:54:08,845
YOU CAN TELL THAT
I'M HEALTHY AND ALERT.

1046
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:10,549
YOU'RE GONNA GET ME
AT A BARGAIN PRICE

1047
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:13,350
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I
WAS TOLD THE BUDGET WAS.

1048
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:16,853
SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL? WHAT
DO YOU WANT TO KNOW FROM ME?"

1049
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:19,856
BUT I WON'T SAY THAT.

1050
00:54:19,856 --> 00:54:23,359
WHAT I WILL SAY IS, UH,

1051
00:54:23,360 --> 00:54:25,862
"VERY PLEASED
TO MEET YOU.

1052
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:28,865
I KNOW YOUR WORK,
AND, UH,

1053
00:54:28,865 --> 00:54:31,868
I'M GLAD THAT I HAVE
THIS OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TO YOU,

1054
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:33,870
AND I WOULD LIKE
TO KNOW WHAT--"

1055
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:35,674
I WON'T USE THIS TERM,

1056
00:54:35,675 --> 00:54:38,375
BUT WHAT CAMERAMEN SAY,
"WHAT YOUR <i>VISION</i> IS".

1057
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:40,377
I AM YOUR
OBEDIENT SERVANT.

1058
00:54:42,379 --> 00:54:45,382
<i>I NEVER KNEW MY FATHER</i>
<i>TO BE ANYONE'S SERVANT.</i>

1059
00:54:45,382 --> 00:54:47,285
<i>AND NO ONE KNOWS THAT BETTER</i>
<i>THAN THE PRODUCER OF</i>

1060
00:54:47,286 --> 00:54:48,786
ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST,

1061
00:54:48,885 --> 00:54:52,889
<i>MICHAEL DOUGLAS.</i> -<i>CUCKOO'S NEST</i>
WAS THE WORST EXPERIENCE

1062
00:54:52,889 --> 00:54:54,891
OF MY ENTIRE CAREER
THAT DAY.

1063
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:57,393
<i>I THINK IT WAS</i>
<i>MICHAEL DOUGLAS WHO SUGGESTED</i>

1064
00:54:57,394 --> 00:55:01,398
<i>THAT I TALK TO HASKELL, AND
I WAS VERY IMPRESSED, BECAUSE I--

1065
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:03,601
YOU KNOW, I THINK
HASKELL IS A BRILLIANT,

1066
00:55:03,602 --> 00:55:04,802
BRILLIANT CINEMATOGRAPHER.

1067
00:55:04,901 --> 00:55:09,405
<i>THE ONLY RESERVATION WAS
THAT HE HAD DIRECTED BEFORE,</i>

1068
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:13,910
<i>AND IT WAS THAT-- THAT SLIGHT
RESERVATION OF A CINEMATOGRAPHER

1069
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:16,913
WHO, YOU KNOW,
MIGHT WANT TO DIRECT,

1070
00:55:16,913 --> 00:55:18,414
AND WOULD HE TAKE OVER?

1071
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:21,418
<i>MILOS FORMAN,</i>
<i>OUR DIRECTOR,</i>

1072
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:24,921
<i>CAME FROM AN EASTERN KIND OF</i>
<i>EUROPEAN DISCIPLINE,</i>

1073
00:55:24,921 --> 00:55:26,923
<i>A SORT OF</i>
<i>AUTHORITARIAN FIGURE,</i>

1074
00:55:26,923 --> 00:55:30,927
AND DID NOT ENJOY
BEING QUESTIONED,

1075
00:55:30,927 --> 00:55:33,930
YOU KNOW,
AND HASKELL CERTAINLY

1076
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,432
LIKED TO QUESTION
AUTHORITY.

1077
00:55:36,433 --> 00:55:41,438
WELL, OUR RELATIONS
STARTED TO DETERIORATE WHEN--

1078
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:45,442
<i>WHEN I FOUND OUT</i>
<i>THAT HE'S SHARING</i> <i>HIS FRUSTRATION</i>

1079
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:47,944
<i>WITH ACTORS,</i>

1080
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:51,948
<i>AND THAT, OF COURSE,</i>
<i>MADE THE ACTORS NERVOUS.</i>

1081
00:55:51,948 --> 00:55:53,950
<i>THAT MADE</i>
<i>THE PRODUCERS NERVOUS.</i>

1082
00:55:53,950 --> 00:55:57,954
<i>AND FINALLY,</i>
<i>IT MADE ME NERVOUS,</i> <i>YOU KNOW.</i>

1083
00:55:57,954 --> 00:56:00,957
<i>YOUR DAD'S TOUGH.</i>
<i>I'LL NEVER FORGET HIS,</i>

1084
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:03,960
YOU KNOW, KIND OF CRITICAL,
KIND OF JUDGING LOOK.

1085
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:06,462
KIND OF NEUTRAL.
YOU COULDN'T QUITE TELL.

1086
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:07,964
IT ALWAYS REMINDED ME
OF MY DAD,

1087
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:10,466
AND MY DAD HAD A VERY
KIND OF A NEUTRAL--

1088
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:12,969
JUST LIKE HE WAS LOOKING
AT YOU, ANALYZING YOU,

1089
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:15,471
MAKING YOU FEEL LIKE,
"JEEZ, I DON'T KNOW".

1090
00:56:15,472 --> 00:56:17,474
I HEAR ACTORS, YOU KNOW,

1091
00:56:17,474 --> 00:56:21,978
COMING AND TELLING ME,
"SO WHAT'S HAPPENING AGAIN?

1092
00:56:21,978 --> 00:56:25,982
<i>HASKELL IS TELLING ME, 'MY GOD,
WHAT IS HE DOING?'" YOU KNOW?

1093
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:27,085
<i>TELLING ACTORS THAT, YOU KNOW,</i>

1094
00:56:27,086 --> 00:56:28,886
<i>NOBODY WILL BE ABLE
TO PUT THIS THING TOGETHER.</i>

1095
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:32,591
<i>I WILL CERTAINLY NOT BE ABLE</i>
<i>TO TIME IT UP PERFECTLY,</i>

1096
00:56:32,592 --> 00:56:34,892
<i>AND THINGS LIKE THAT.</i>

1097
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:37,994
<i>WHICH I'LL TELL YOU,</i>
<i>YOU KNOW, IT'S SORT OF SILLY,</i>

1098
00:56:37,994 --> 00:56:42,498
<i>BECAUSE WHY DOES HE COMPLAIN</i>
<i>TO PEOPLE WHO-- WHO</i> I <i>HIRED?</i>

1099
00:56:42,499 --> 00:56:44,501
WHO ARE LOYAL TO ME
BECAUSE I HIRED THEM?

1100
00:56:44,501 --> 00:56:46,503
OF COURSE THEY WILL
COME AND TELL ME.

1101
00:56:46,503 --> 00:56:50,006
TO THIS DAY, BECAUSE
IT WAS MY FIRST MOVIE,

1102
00:56:50,006 --> 00:56:53,009
IT WAS THE HARDEST THING
I'D EVER DONE IN MY LIFE.

1103
00:56:53,009 --> 00:56:56,512
<i>BECAUSE HE WAS OLD ENOUGH</i>
<i>TO BE MY DAD,</i>

1104
00:56:56,513 --> 00:56:59,516
<i>AND HE WAS</i>
<i>AN ACADEMY-AWARD WINNER,</i>

1105
00:56:59,516 --> 00:57:02,519
AND JUST DIDN'T...
WORK OUT.

1106
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:06,022
<i>I REPLACED HASKELL
WEXLER ON</i> CUCKOO'S NEST.

1107
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:09,525
NOBODY SAID ANYTHING TO ME
ABOUT WHY HE WAS LET GO.

1108
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:14,530
<i>I KNOW WHY.</i>

1109
00:57:14,531 --> 00:57:16,533
<i>AS I WATCHED</i>
<i>HASKELL'S FOOTAGE</i>

1110
00:57:16,533 --> 00:57:19,035
<i>AS HE WENT ON</i>
<i>INTO THE PICTURE,</i>

1111
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:21,537
<i>I COULD SEE IT</i>
<i>DETERIORATE</i>

1112
00:57:21,538 --> 00:57:25,542
<i>AND BE LESS SHARP</i>
<i>AND LESS INSPIRED.</i>

1113
00:57:25,542 --> 00:57:28,044
<i>AND I'VE BEEN THERE,</i>
<i>SO I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE.</i>

1114
00:57:28,044 --> 00:57:32,048
<i>AND IT'S SIMPLY A CASE WHERE
YOU ARE TRYING VERY, VERY HARD

1115
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:34,050
<i>TO PLEASE THE DIRECTOR,</i>

1116
00:57:34,050 --> 00:57:37,053
<i>AND YOU DON'T KNOW</i>
<i>WHAT HE WANTS.</i>

1117
00:57:37,053 --> 00:57:40,556
<i>IT WAS ONE OF
THE FEW TIMES IN MY LIFE</i>

1118
00:57:40,557 --> 00:57:45,061
<i>THAT I WAS...</i>
<i>TRULY DEVASTATED.</i>

1119
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:48,564
<i>I WAS SAYING I FELT</i>
<i>LIKE COMMITTING SUICIDE.</i>

1120
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:51,568
<i>I FELT</i> HORRIBLE.

1121
00:57:51,568 --> 00:57:54,571
<i>TO THIS DAY,</i>
<i>I DON'T KNOW</i>

1122
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:57,073
EXACTLY WHY I WAS FIRED.

1123
00:57:57,073 --> 00:58:00,076
UM, HOWEVER,

1124
00:58:00,076 --> 00:58:05,081
I HAD-- AND I HAVE--
SERIOUS CLUES.

1125
00:58:05,081 --> 00:58:10,086
<i>ABOUT SIX MONTHS BEFORE</i>
<i>WE FILMED</i> CUCKOO'S NEST,

1126
00:58:10,086 --> 00:58:12,588
<i>MY FRIEND DE ANTONIO</i>
<i>SAID THAT</i>

1127
00:58:12,589 --> 00:58:16,092
HE HAD CONTACT WITH
FUGITIVES FROM JUSTICE

1128
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:18,094
<i>KNOWN AS</i>
<i>THE WEATHER UNDERGROUND,</i>

1129
00:58:18,094 --> 00:58:22,598
<i>AND WOULD I BE INTERESTED</i>
<i>IN SHOOTING THE FILM?</i>

1130
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:25,101
<i>AND I'D LIKE TO KNOW
IF PEOPLE GO AROUND</i>

1131
00:58:25,101 --> 00:58:29,105
<i>AFRAID THAT A COP</i>
<i>OR SOME F.B.I. MAN</i>

1132
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:31,607
<i>OR SOME C.I.A. MAN</i>
<i>IS GONNA-- IS GONNA GRAB 'EM.</i>

1133
00:58:31,608 --> 00:58:34,110
<i>I JUST WANT TO KNOW</i>
<i>IF YOU WALK AROUND</i> <i>WITH THAT FEAR.</i>

1134
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:37,113
<i>THE INSTRUCTIONS WERE,</i>
<i>I COULDN'T SHOW ANY PEOPLE,</i>

1135
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:40,616
<i>I COULDN'T SHOW ANY FACES,</i>
<i>I CAN'T EVEN SHOW</i> <i>HEADS OF HAIR.</i>

1136
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:45,121
<i>SO I WAS OBLIGED</i>
<i>MOSTLY TO, UH,</i>

1137
00:58:45,121 --> 00:58:48,124
<i>USE SOME</i>
<i>CHEESECLOTH MATERIAL</i>

1138
00:58:48,124 --> 00:58:50,126
<i>THAT YOUR MOTHER</i>
<i>GAVE ME,</i>

1139
00:58:50,126 --> 00:58:52,628
<i>AND, UH,</i>
<i>THERE WAS A MIRROR</i>

1140
00:58:52,629 --> 00:58:54,631
<i>ON THE WALL.</i>

1141
00:58:54,631 --> 00:58:57,634
<i>AND SO I BASICALLY SHOT--</i>
<i>THE ONLY THING I COULD SHOOT</i>

1142
00:58:57,634 --> 00:59:02,138
<i>WAS MYSELF AND DE ANTONIO</i>
<i>IN THE MIRROR.</i>

1143
00:59:02,138 --> 00:59:06,142
<i>AFTER</i> CUCKOO'S NEST
<i>HAD WRAPPED,</i>

1144
00:59:06,142 --> 00:59:08,644
<i>THE ACCOUNTANT</i>
<i>ON THE FILM</i>

1145
00:59:08,645 --> 00:59:13,149
SAID THAT THE F.B.I.
WAS UP IN OREGON,

1146
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:16,152
AND THEY WERE QUESTIONING,
UH, SOME OF THE MAIDS,

1147
00:59:16,152 --> 00:59:19,155
AND THEY CAME IN
AND QUESTIONED HIM ABOUT ME.

1148
00:59:19,155 --> 00:59:24,160
NEVER. I NEVER HEARD
ABOUT F.B.I. COMING ON THE SET.

1149
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:26,162
CERTAINLY DIDN'T
TALK TO ME.

1150
00:59:26,162 --> 00:59:28,664
AND NOBODY TOLD ME
THAT THEY WERE THERE.

1151
00:59:28,665 --> 00:59:31,668
I, UH, HAVE NO IDEA.

1152
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:34,170
THE GOVERNMENT COULD HAVE
MADE TROUBLE FOR MILOS,

1153
00:59:34,170 --> 00:59:38,174
AND MY GUESS IS, THEY, UH--
THEY PUT THE HEAT ON MILOS

1154
00:59:38,174 --> 00:59:42,178
TO, UM-- UH--
TO GET RID OF ME.

1155
00:59:42,178 --> 00:59:45,681
<i>NO. OF ALL THE PEOPLE
TO TELL THAT TO,</i>

1156
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:49,686
<i>I'D BE THE ONE, BECAUSE I'VE
ALWAYS BEEN VERY SYMPATHETIC

1157
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:52,689
<i>TO HIS POLITICS.</i>

1158
00:59:52,689 --> 00:59:54,691
WHY WOULD HE NOT
HAVE TOLD ME

1159
00:59:54,691 --> 00:59:58,194
ABOUT THE F.B.I.?

1160
00:59:58,194 --> 01:00:04,133
BECAUSE HE LOVED TO BE THE
VICTIM. ESPECIALLY THE VICTIM

1161
01:00:04,133 --> 01:00:07,202
OF THE F.B.I.,
BECAUSE WE ALL HATED THE F.B.I.

1162
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:09,205
THE F.B.I. IS
A JERKY ORGANIZATION.

1163
01:00:09,205 --> 01:00:12,708
<i>IT HAPPENED AGAIN</i>
<i>ON</i> THE CONVERSATION

1164
01:00:12,709 --> 01:00:15,712
<i>WHERE HASKELL DID NOT</i>
<i>GET ALONG WITH THE DIRECTOR,</i>

1165
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:20,216
<i>AND SO THE DIRECTOR ASKED ME</i>
<i>TO COME IN AND SHOOT</i> <i>FOR HIM THEN.</i>

1166
01:00:20,216 --> 01:00:24,220
<i>AND HASKELL KNOWS THE AGENT</i>
<i>THAT I HAD AT THE TIME,</i>

1167
01:00:24,220 --> 01:00:26,722
<i>WHO WAS CRAYTON SMITH,</i>

1168
01:00:26,723 --> 01:00:30,226
AND HE CALLED CRAYTON UP ONE
DAY-- WELL, IT'S NOT HIS AGENT--

1169
01:00:30,226 --> 01:00:32,228
BUT HE CALLED CRAYTON
UP ONE DAY, AND HE SAYS,

1170
01:00:32,228 --> 01:00:35,731
"HEY, CRAYTON. GET BUTLER READY.
I'VE GOT ANOTHER PICTURE".

1171
01:00:37,734 --> 01:00:41,237
<i>SOMEONE LIKE YOUR DAD
IS ALSO A DIRECTOR--</i>

1172
01:00:41,237 --> 01:00:43,239
<i>IF DIRECTORS</i>
<i>LIKE YOUR DAD--</i>

1173
01:00:43,239 --> 01:00:45,741
<i>AND I'M TALKING ABOUT</i>
<i>SERIOUS HEAVYWEIGHTS--</i>

1174
01:00:45,742 --> 01:00:47,546
<i>SNIFF THAT THE GUY THAT</i>
<i>THEY'RE WORKING FOR</i>

1175
01:00:47,547 --> 01:00:50,147
IS LESS COMPETENT THAN THEMSELVES--

1176
01:00:50,246 --> 01:00:52,248
AND THIS MAY BE
A SUBCONSCIOUS THING--

1177
01:00:52,248 --> 01:00:54,250
THAT'S WHEN THEY START
TO BECOME DIFFICULT.

1178
01:00:54,250 --> 01:00:57,253
IT'S NOT LIKE HASKELL,
YOU KNOW, DOES A PALACE COUP

1179
01:00:57,253 --> 01:01:00,756
<i>AND STARTS SAYING, "NO, WE'RE NOT
GONNA SHOOT THIS SCENE TODAY.

1180
01:01:00,757 --> 01:01:02,759
<i>WE'RE GONNA SHOOT THIS ONE</i>
<i>INSTEAD" OR ANYTHING.</i>

1181
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:05,261
<i>HE'S JUST VERY FORCEFUL</i>
<i>ABOUT HIS OPINIONS.</i>

1182
01:01:05,261 --> 01:01:07,763
<i>I PRAISE HIM FOR THAT FILM.</i>

1183
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:10,767
<i>I REALLY DIDN'T GET ALONG WITH HIM
AND DIDN'T LIKE HIM PERSONALLY,

1184
01:01:10,767 --> 01:01:13,770
<i>AND HE'S THE ONLY CAMERAMAN
I'VE EVER BEEN ON BAD TERMS WITH.

1185
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:17,273
I WOULD NEVER USE HIM AGAIN, BUT
HE WAS A DAMN GOOD CAMERAMAN.

1186
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:20,276
HE'S A PAIN IN THE ASS
TO WORK WITH, HASKELL.

1187
01:01:20,276 --> 01:01:24,280
<i>YEAH. IT'S HIS ATTEMPT,</i>
<i>I THINK,</i>

1188
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:27,283
<i>TO CONTROL THE STORY.</i>

1189
01:01:27,283 --> 01:01:31,287
<i>I JUST THINK THERE WAS
A PERIOD IN HASKELL'S LIFE</i>

1190
01:01:31,287 --> 01:01:34,790
<i>WHERE THE FRUSTRATION</i>
<i>AS A DIRECTOR WAS IMMENSE</i>

1191
01:01:34,791 --> 01:01:37,794
<i>AND WOULD HAVE PROBABLY</i>
<i>BEEN BETTER SERVED</i>

1192
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:39,098
<i>BY GOING BACK TO THOSE

1193
01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:41,799
DOCUMENTARIES OR
WHATEVER IT WAS AT THAT POINT.

1194
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:48,304
AS A DIRECTOR OF PHOTOGRAPHY,
I ALWAYS HAVE WORKED

1195
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:50,806
AS IF IT'S <i>MY</i> FILM.

1196
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:53,311
<i>YOU'D ALMOST IN A SENSE</i>
<i>RATHER BE DIRECTING THE MOVIE.</i>

1197
01:01:53,312 --> 01:01:54,712
<i>OR WOULD YOU NOT?</i>

1198
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:58,314
<i>I DON'T THINK THERE'S</i>
<i>A MOVIE THAT I'VE BEEN ON</i>

1199
01:01:58,314 --> 01:02:00,816
<i>THAT I WASN'T</i> SURE
<i>I COULD DIRECT IT BETTER.</i>

1200
01:02:03,319 --> 01:02:05,321
<i>BUT CERTAINLY ALSO,</i>

1201
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:09,825
AS A DIRECTOR
OF PHOTOGRAPHY,

1202
01:02:09,826 --> 01:02:12,829
I HAVE TO SERVE
THE MOVIE

1203
01:02:12,829 --> 01:02:15,331
IN WHATEVER WAY I CAN

1204
01:02:15,331 --> 01:02:17,833
<i>AS A-- AS A</i>
<i>FILMMAKER.</i>

1205
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:21,337
<i>YOU TOLD ME YOU WERE
COLOR BLIND. IS THAT TRUE?</i>

1206
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:25,841
<i>I DON'T KNOW THE LEVEL
OF MY COLORBLINDNESS.</i>

1207
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:27,343
<i>WHAT DO YOU SEE?</i>

1208
01:02:27,343 --> 01:02:29,845
OKAY,
THIS SAYS "12".

1209
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:32,849
THIS IS NO PROBLEM
AT ALL.

1210
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:35,852
OH, AND IT SAYS ON THE BACK,
"EVERYONE SEES 12".

1211
01:02:35,852 --> 01:02:37,854
<i>AND THE NEXT ONE?</i>

1212
01:02:37,854 --> 01:02:39,856
<i>WHAT DO YOU SEE?</i>

1213
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:48,864
I CAN'T-- I CAN'T
REALLY SEE THIS ONE.

1214
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:52,368
NO, I C-- I CANNOT S--

1215
01:02:52,368 --> 01:02:54,370
<i>THAT'S EIGHT.</i>

1216
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:58,874
OOH, THIS IS A BITCH.

1217
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:01,878
I'LL SHOW IT TO THE AUDIENCE.
I'M NOT LOOKING AT THE BACK.

1218
01:03:01,878 --> 01:03:06,382
YOU DEFINITELY SEE
A NUMBER HERE.

1219
01:03:06,382 --> 01:03:08,384
I CAN'T SEE ANY NUMBER
HERE AT ALL.

1220
01:03:08,384 --> 01:03:09,885
<i>THAT'S 16.</i>

1221
01:03:09,886 --> 01:03:12,889
<i>WELL--</i>

1222
01:03:12,889 --> 01:03:16,893
<i>IT'S HARD TO DESCRIBE WHAT
MIGHT BE CALLED COLORBLINDNESS,

1223
01:03:16,893 --> 01:03:20,897
<i>BECAUSE I HAVE AN ACUTE</i>
<i>SENSIBILITY FOR DENSITY,</i>

1224
01:03:20,897 --> 01:03:24,901
<i>FOR, UH, DIFFERENCES</i>
<i>IN-IN GRAY AND WHITE.</i>

1225
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:30,406
AND I THINK, ACTUALLY, MY LACK
OF TOTAL COLOR SENSITIVITY

1226
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:34,410
<i>IS A POSITIVE FACTOR</i>
<i>RATHER THAN A NEGATIVE FACTOR,</i>

1227
01:03:34,410 --> 01:03:37,413
<i>ALTHOUGH CERTAINLY</i>
<i>DURING MY LIFE</i> <i>AS A CAMERAMAN,</i>

1228
01:03:37,413 --> 01:03:40,416
<i>I DID NOT WANT IT</i>
<i>PUBLICIZED.</i>

1229
01:03:42,919 --> 01:03:46,422
IN TERMS
OF MAKING FILMS

1230
01:03:46,422 --> 01:03:49,925
AND HOW HEAVY A HAND YOU USE
AND HOW DIRECT YOU ARE

1231
01:03:49,926 --> 01:03:52,929
IN TERMS OF
PUTTING FORTH YOUR AGENDA

1232
01:03:52,929 --> 01:03:56,432
IS-- I THINK, PROBABLY BEEN
AN ISSUE ON SOME OF HIS FILMS.

1233
01:03:56,432 --> 01:03:59,935
I THINK IN <i>MEDIUM COOL</i>
IT WAS ACTUALLY A GREAT ASSET,

1234
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:03,439
AND IT'S A VERY INTERESTING
FILM AND A DOCUMENT OF THE TIMES.

1235
01:04:03,439 --> 01:04:06,442
AND THE OTHER FILMS,
I THINK, YOU KNOW,

1236
01:04:06,442 --> 01:04:08,944
IT MAY HAVE GOTTEN
IN THE WAY OF THE STORYTELLING.

1237
01:04:12,949 --> 01:04:14,951
<i>WELL, HE GAVE ME</i> <i>A SCRIPT ONE TIME</i>

1238
01:04:14,951 --> 01:04:16,953
<i>TO BE SHOT</i>

1239
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:19,956
<i>TOLD HIM I DIDN'T LIKE IT.</i>
<i>"DON'T SHOOT IT.</i>

1240
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:24,460
IT'S TOO... OVERT,
THE MESSAGE.

1241
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:28,464

YOU CAN BE MUCH MORE <i>SUBTLE</i>".

1242
01:04:28,464 --> 01:04:31,069
<i>LATINO</i> IS WRITTEN AND DIRECTED

1243

BY TWO-TIME OSCAR WINNER
HASKELL WEXLER.

1244
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:37,473
IT IS A PRESENTATION OF GEORGE
LUCAS' COMPANY, LUCASFILM.

1245
01:04:37,473 --> 01:04:40,476
ITS STORY IS AS TOPICAL
AS TODAY'S HEADLINES,

1246
01:04:40,476 --> 01:04:42,978
AND EVERY MAJOR
STUDIO IN HOLLYWOOD

1247
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:45,481
HAS REFUSED TO
DISTRIBUTE IT.

1248
01:04:45,481 --> 01:04:50,486
<i>THE MAJOR STUDIOS WOULD NOT
PICK UP</i> LATINO, <i>IN MY OPINION,</i>

1249
01:04:50,486 --> 01:04:54,091
<i>BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED IT WOULD
JUST BE TROUBLE FOR THEM--

1250

<i>POLITICAL TROUBLE.

<i>IS THE FERTILIZER</i> <i>OF DEMOCRACY,</i>

1252
01:04:59,495 --> 01:05:01,497

OF IT, AND I'M PLEASED THAT

1253
01:05:01,497 --> 01:05:03,999

<i>HASKELL'S GREAT

<i>TAKING THAT NOTION,</i>

1258
01:05:16,012 --> 01:05:19,515
LET'S PUT OUR ACTORS
INTO THE REALITY OF NICARAGUA

1259
01:05:19,515 --> 01:05:22,518

GOING ON BETWEEN THE CONTRAS

<i>AND THE SANDINISTA</i>
<i>GOVERNMENT.</i>

1261

01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:33,430
<i>AND WHAT WAS REALLY STRANGE

1264
01:05:33,431 --> 01:05:35,031
<i>WAS THAT THE THINGS
THAT WE WERE FILMING

1265
01:05:35,031 --> 01:05:37,536
<i>WERE ACTUALLY HAPPENING
IN NICARAGUA,

1266
01:05:37,537 --> 01:05:39,937
<i>WHICH WAS AT THE HEIGHT
OF THE CONTRA WAR.</i>

1267
01:05:40,036 --> 01:05:42,340
<i>YOU COULD ALMOST</i>
<i>CALL IT GUERILLA FILMMAKING.</i>

1268
01:05:42,341 --> 01:05:43,941
<i>THERE WERE GUERILLAS THERE.</i>

1269
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:48,044
<i>EVEN TO THE POINT WHERE,</i>
<i>IN A FIREFIGHT IN THE MOVIE,</i>

1270
01:05:48,044 --> 01:05:52,048
<i>THESE VERY ENTHUSIASTIC EXTRAS</i>
<i>STARTED TO USE LIVE AMMUNITION.</i>

1271
01:05:52,048 --> 01:05:55,551
SO THIS WAS-- I MEAN,
IT GOT VERY DICEY.

1272
01:05:55,551 --> 01:06:00,556
<i>BUT HE REALLY LOVED IT. I MEAN,
I THINK HE WAS IN HIS ELEMENT.

1273
01:06:00,556 --> 01:06:03,058
<i>WEXLER THINKS</i> <i>THE WHITE HOUSE,</i>

1274
01:06:03,059 --> 01:06:05,062
<i>WHICH OPPOSES THE SANDINISTA</i>
<i>REGIME IN NICARAGUA</i>

1275
01:06:05,063 --> 01:06:06,463
<i>WOULD BE, QUOTE,</i>

1276
01:06:06,562 --> 01:06:10,065
<i>"ECSTATIC," END QUOTE,</i> <i>IF</i> LATINO
<i>WERE NEVER SEEN</i> <i>OR FLOPPED.</i>

1277
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:12,568
- MARY.
- THANK YOU, RONA.

1278
01:06:14,070 --> 01:06:16,572
<i>WELL, THE REAGAN
WHITE HOUSE GOT ITS WISH.</i>

1279
01:06:16,572 --> 01:06:19,074
LATINO <i>BOMBED</i>
<i>AT THE BOX OFFICE.</i>

1280
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:25,081
<i>THE STRENGTH OF
BOTH</i> LATINO <i>AND</i> MEDIUM COOL

1281
01:06:25,081 --> 01:06:28,084
<i>ARE THE DOCUMENTARY ELEMENTS</i>
<i>KIND OF MEETING</i>

1282
01:06:28,084 --> 01:06:31,587
WITH THE FICTIONAL,
TRADITIONAL ELEMENTS IN THEM.

1283
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:33,589
THAT'S A DIFFICULT
WAY TO SHOOT,

1284
01:06:33,589 --> 01:06:36,592
AND IT'S A WAY THAT MAKES
FINANCIERS NERVOUS,

1285
01:06:36,592 --> 01:06:38,594
BECAUSE IT'S NOT
ALL THERE ON THE PAGE.

1286
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:41,597
<i>I WISH HASKELL
HAD DIRECTED MORE MOVIES</i>

1287
01:06:41,597 --> 01:06:45,601
<i>AND HAD BEEN A LITTLE MORE</i>
<i>APOLITICAL FROM TIME TO TIME,</i>

1288
01:06:45,601 --> 01:06:48,103
BECAUSE HE,
AS A DIRECTOR, WOULD HAVE MADE

1289
01:06:48,104 --> 01:06:53,109
SOME VERY ENGAGING PICTURES ABOUT
PEOPLE AND NOT JUST ABOUT CAUSES.

1290
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:58,614
<i>FOR MY FATHER,</i>
<i>THE CAUSE ALWAYS COMES FIRST.</i>

1291
01:06:58,614 --> 01:07:01,116
<i>THE ONE THAT HE'S CURRENTLY
INVOLVED WITH IS THE FIGHT

1292
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:04,620
<i>FOR SANER WORK HOURS</i>
<i>ON HOLLYWOOD FILM PRODUCTIONS.</i>

1293
01:07:04,620 --> 01:07:07,623
<i>HE'S MAKING</i>
<i>A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT IT.</i>

1294
01:07:07,623 --> 01:07:10,125
<i>HE'S ASKED ME TO HELP HIM</i>
<i>SHOOT JULIA ROBERTS,</i>

1295
01:07:10,126 --> 01:07:14,630
<i>WHO'S AGREED</i>
<i>TO AN INTERVIEW.</i> <i>I MUST CONFESS,</i>

1296
01:07:14,630 --> 01:07:17,132
<i>I GET A BIT NERVOUS</i>
<i>AROUND HOLLYWOOD ROYALTY.</i>

1297
01:07:17,133 --> 01:07:21,137
<i>MY FATHER,</i>
<i>THE OLD PRO, DOESN'T.</i>

1298
01:07:26,142 --> 01:07:29,645
<i>SO YOU THINK IT'S GONNA BE ALL
RIGHT FOR ME TO SHOOT TOMORROW?</i>

1299
01:07:29,645 --> 01:07:32,147
<i>I JUST DON'T KNOW</i>
<i>WHEN WE SHOULD DO IT.</i>

1300
01:07:32,148 --> 01:07:34,150
<i>I DON'T WANT YOU SHOOTING</i>
<i>WHEN I'M SHOOTING.</i>

1301
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:36,152
THAT'S THE HOT SEAT?

1302
01:07:36,152 --> 01:07:38,654
THAT'S THE HOT SEAT.

1303
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:41,156
<i>I WANT TO HAVE</i> <i>THE CONCENTRATION</i>

1304
01:07:41,157 --> 01:07:43,159
<i>ON THE MAIN THING.</i>

1305
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:46,662
THE MAIN THING
IS <i>MY</i> MOVIE.

1306
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:50,666
<i>WE DID SORT OF GET
IN EACH OTHER'S WAY AT FIRST,</i>

1307
01:07:50,666 --> 01:07:53,669
<i>BUT JULIA WAS</i>
<i>A GOOD SPORT ABOUT IT.</i>

1308
01:07:53,669 --> 01:07:56,672
IS THERE A REASON WHY
WE HAVE AN ARTICLE ON GAS?

1309
01:07:58,674 --> 01:08:01,176
IT'S THE FUNNIEST THING.
IT'S MY NUTRITION MAGAZINE.

1310
01:08:01,177 --> 01:08:04,180
YEAH, I JUST REFUSE
TO BE GASEOUS.

1311
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:06,182
IT'S UNBECOMING.

1312
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:08,684
<i>MARK, AM I PRESSING</i>
<i>THE WRONG BUTTONS HERE?</i>

1313
01:08:08,684 --> 01:08:10,686
- <i>I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S--</i>
- <i>STAND BY.</i>

1314
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:15,190
JULIA, WE CAME HERE
BECAUSE WE HEARD

1315
01:08:15,191 --> 01:08:19,195
THAT YOU HAD SOME FEELINGS
ABOUT THE LONG HOURS.

1316
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:21,697
WELL, FIRST,
I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT--

1317
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:24,199
<i>THE INTERVIEW WENT ALONG
SMOOTHLY. I LET DAD BE IN CHARGE,

1318
01:08:24,200 --> 01:08:26,702
<i>AND I TRIED TO STAY OUT OF
THE WAY THE BEST I COULD.

1319
01:08:26,702 --> 01:08:29,705
...AND THEN GO HOME
WITH THIS GREAT TRIUMPH

1320
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:31,707
UNDER YOUR BELT
TO TAKE HOME TO YOUR FAMILY

1321
01:08:31,707 --> 01:08:33,709
WHEN YOU'RE NOT COMATOSE
AND A ZOMBIE

1322
01:08:33,709 --> 01:08:35,512
AND YOUR KIDS HAVE ALREADY
BEEN PUT TO BED

1323
01:08:35,513 --> 01:08:37,213
AND YOU'RE KIND OF
MISSING EVERYTHING.

1324
01:08:39,215 --> 01:08:41,717
SORRY.

1325
01:08:41,717 --> 01:08:44,219
HE BROUGHT
A STICK TO ME.

1326
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:46,722
TAKE IT OUTSIDE, LOUIE.
OUT. OUT, OUT, OUT. COME ON.

1327
01:08:46,722 --> 01:08:49,725
HEY, MARKO, YOU'RE ALSO
GETTING IN JULIA'S SHOT,

1328
01:08:49,725 --> 01:08:51,226
<i>AND, UM--</i>

1329
01:08:51,227 --> 01:08:54,730
YOU AND LOUIE ARE TRYING
TO HOG MY CAMERA TIME.

1330
01:08:54,730 --> 01:08:56,231
UM--

1331
01:08:56,232 --> 01:08:59,735
<i>MARK, WE'RE THROUGH</i>
<i>WITH THE SHOOT. WE DID IT.</i>

1332
01:08:59,735 --> 01:09:02,738
IT WAS P--
I THINK IT WAS PERFECT.

1333
01:09:02,738 --> 01:09:06,241
THAT IF YOU HAVE
MILK PRODUCTS WITH NO FOOD,

1334
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:08,244
IT'S LIKELY
TO BE GAS.

1335
01:09:08,244 --> 01:09:11,747
BUT THEN THEY
GO INTO ODORS, AND THEY SELL--

1336
01:09:11,747 --> 01:09:15,250
<i>YOU DEPORTED YOURSELF WELL,</i>

1337
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:19,255
<i>AND YOU HELPED ME COVER</i>
<i>FOR MY LACK OF-- OF HEARING.</i>

1338
01:09:19,255 --> 01:09:21,257
<i>SO I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.</i>
<i>IT WAS REALLY GOOD.</i>

1339
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:23,259
- <i>IT WAS FUN.</i>
- <i>YEAH, GOOD.</i>

1340
01:09:23,259 --> 01:09:25,264
I WOKE UP THIS MORNING,
AND I THOUGHT,

1341
01:09:25,265 --> 01:09:28,165
"I SEE MYSELF HAVING A
CONVERSATION ABOUT GAS

1342
01:09:28,264 --> 01:09:30,266
ON THE FRONT PORCH THIS MORNING--
I CAN JUST SEE IT HAPPENING".

1343
01:09:30,266 --> 01:09:34,770
I THINK NOW
I DESERVE TO, UH, TO TAKE A REST.

1344
01:09:34,770 --> 01:09:38,273
'CAUSE I HEARD DANNY ASK
HOW OLD YOUR FATHER IS.

1345
01:09:38,274 --> 01:09:40,776
I HEARD IT
ON THE THING, SEE?

1346
01:09:40,776 --> 01:09:44,279
AND, UH, I DON'T KNOW
WHETHER HE WAS ASKING

1347
01:09:44,280 --> 01:09:47,783
TO FIND OUT WHETHER HE SHOULD
GET ME A WHEELCHAIR OR WHAT,

1348
01:09:47,783 --> 01:09:50,285
BUT, UH,
IN ANY EVENT--

1349
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:53,289
I'M NOT SURE I HEARD
YOUR RESPONSE, MARK, BUT--

1350
01:09:53,289 --> 01:09:57,793
ANYWAY, FOR THIS SHOOT,
WE DID GREAT. OKAY?

1351
01:09:59,795 --> 01:10:03,298
<i>WE WERE BOTH FEELING PRETTY
GOOD ABOUT OUR SHOOT WITH JULIA,</i>

1352
01:10:03,299 --> 01:10:05,801
<i>AND THERE WAS NO REAL RUSH</i>
<i>TO GET BACK TO LOS ANGELES,</i>

1353
01:10:05,801 --> 01:10:09,805
<i>SO I THOUGHT DAD AND I COULD SPEND
SOME TIME TOGETHER ENJOYING TAOS.

1354
01:10:09,805 --> 01:10:12,808
IT'S CALLED
A CIGASTO INDIAN.

1355
01:10:12,808 --> 01:10:16,311
MEANING
A CIGAR STORE INDIAN.

1356
01:10:16,312 --> 01:10:19,315
THIS IS WHAT
TOURISTS DO.

1357
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:21,317
<i>WE GOT AN AMERICAN FLAG.</i>

1358
01:10:21,317 --> 01:10:23,819
OH, YEAH. YOU WANT ME TO KISS
IT FOR YOU OR SOMETHING, MARK?

1359
01:10:23,819 --> 01:10:26,822
<i>YEAH, YEAH.</i>
<i>THIS IS AMERICA.</i>

1360
01:10:26,822 --> 01:10:28,323
WATCH YOUR STEP.

1361
01:10:28,324 --> 01:10:30,826
<i>SO DAD, THIS IS ONE OF THE
OLDEST MISSIONS IN NEW MEXICO.

1362
01:10:30,826 --> 01:10:33,530
<i>I DID A STORY</i> <i>FOR</i>
SMITHSONIAN <i>MAGAZINE</i>

1363
01:10:33,531 --> 01:10:35,331
<i>ABOUT THE RESTORATION OF IT.</i>

1364
01:10:35,331 --> 01:10:37,333
<i>AND I SPENT, LIKE,</i>
<i>A WEEK HERE.</i>

1365
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:41,337
THESE ARE THE ARTIFACTS
OF THE CONQUERORS,

1366
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:44,840
THE PEOPLE THAT CAME IN
UNDER THE NAME OF JESUS

1367
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:48,343
AND, UH, QUOTE,
"CIVILIZED" THE INHABITANTS,

1368
01:10:48,344 --> 01:10:50,346
THE NATIVES
WHO WERE HERE.

1369
01:10:50,346 --> 01:10:52,449
<i>WHY CAN'T YOU JUST APPRECIATE IT?</i>

1370
01:10:52,450 --> 01:10:53,750
<i>WHY DOES EVERYTHING
HAVE TO BE SO NEGATIVE?

1371
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:55,851
MARK,
THIS IS NOT NEGATIVE.

1372
01:10:55,851 --> 01:10:58,353
THIS IS PART OF UNDERSTANDING
HISTORY AND EDUCATION.

1373
01:10:58,354 --> 01:11:00,856
IT'S ALSO--
BEYOND THAT,

1374
01:11:00,856 --> 01:11:05,360
IT'S BECAUSE YOU WANT
TO HAVE A FILM THAT, UH,

1375
01:11:05,361 --> 01:11:07,863
KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT
THE WAY I LOOK AT THINGS,

1376
01:11:07,863 --> 01:11:10,866
AND I LOOK AT THEM AS,
YES, THIS IS FINE,

1377
01:11:10,866 --> 01:11:14,369
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL CHURCH,
THIS IS A BEAUTIFUL STATUE,

1378
01:11:14,370 --> 01:11:18,374
<i>BUT IT REPRESENTS THE COLONIZATION
OF THE CATHOLIC CHURCH

1379
01:11:18,374 --> 01:11:21,877
<i>AND PART OF THE DESTRUCTION
OF THE INDIAN RACE.

1380
01:11:21,877 --> 01:11:25,380
IF WE DON'T UNDERSTAND
HISTORY, WE WILL HAVE TO

1381
01:11:25,381 --> 01:11:28,384
SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES
IN THE PRESENT.

1382
01:11:45,401 --> 01:11:48,904
I KNEW YOU WHEN YOU
WERE A SMALL CHILD,

1383
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:52,908
AND THEN I KNEW YOU
AS AN OLDER CHILD.

1384
01:11:52,908 --> 01:11:56,912
<i>AT THAT TIME, YOUR FATHER</i>
<i>WAS GOING THROUGH A DIVORCE,</i>

1385
01:11:56,912 --> 01:12:00,415
<i>AND IT MIGHT HAVE AFFECTED</i>

1386
01:12:00,416 --> 01:12:03,419
<i>YOUR RELATIONSHIP</i>
<i>WITH YOUR FATHER.</i>

1387
01:12:05,421 --> 01:12:08,924
<i>AND IT TAKES SOME TIME</i>
<i>TO GET OVER THE IDEA THAT</i>

1388
01:12:08,924 --> 01:12:11,426
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE TOGETHER
IN A WONDERFUL FAMILY

1389
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:13,929
ALL THE REST OF YOUR LIFE
AND ALL OF THAT KIND OF THING.

1390
01:12:16,932 --> 01:12:19,935
<i>THE THING</i>
<i>ABOUT IT IS THAT</i>

1391
01:12:19,935 --> 01:12:23,939
<i>YOU DON'T GIVE UP</i>
<i>THESE FAMILY RELATIONSHIPS.</i>

1392
01:12:23,939 --> 01:12:25,941
IT'S GREAT.

1393
01:12:28,444 --> 01:12:33,449
I REMEMBER THAT WE TOOK UP A VERY
FOND RELATIONSHIP AT THAT TIME

1394
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:35,951
BECAUSE WE WERE
BOTH SORT OF...

1395
01:12:38,454 --> 01:12:41,457
FALSTAFFS,
I CALL IT.

1396
01:12:41,457 --> 01:12:43,959
<i>WE SAW A LOT</i>
<i>OF HUMOR IN LIFE.</i>

1397
01:12:43,959 --> 01:12:47,065
<i>BUT I WAS GLAD</i>
<i>TO HAVE A SURROGATE-FATHER</i>

1398
01:12:47,066 --> 01:12:49,866
<i>RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU,</i>

1399
01:12:49,965 --> 01:12:51,967
AND NOW THAT
YOU'RE GROWN UP,

1400
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:55,470
UH, SO TO SPEAK,

1401
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:58,275
<i>I THINK YOU'RE TRYING
TO GET TO KNOW YOUR FATHER

1402
01:12:58,276 --> 01:12:59,876
<i>IN AN EMOTIONAL WAY,

1403
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:04,479
<i>WHICH MAY NOT HAVE BEEN
ACCESSIBLE EARLIER IN YOUR LIFE.

1404
01:13:04,480 --> 01:13:06,482
HERE'S THE OPENING
OF THE MOVIE.

1405
01:13:06,482 --> 01:13:09,985
IT'S AFTER THE WEDDING,
AND, LIKE, HERE'S THIS CAR

1406
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:11,987
<i>SITTING ALL ALONE</i>
<i>OVER THERE,</i>

1407
01:13:11,987 --> 01:13:15,991
<i>AND, UH, YOU CAN'T SEE</i>
<i>THE PEOPLE INSIDE</i>

1408
01:13:15,991 --> 01:13:18,493
<i>BECAUSE OF THE REFLECTION</i>
<i>OF THE WHITE SKY.</i>

1409
01:13:18,494 --> 01:13:22,498
<i>AND WE MOVE IN</i>
<i>AND WE MOVE IN,</i> <i>AND, UH,</i>

1410
01:13:22,498 --> 01:13:26,001
THERE'S THIS SORT OF

1411
01:13:26,001 --> 01:13:29,504
BABY-TALK, YOU KNOW,
KIND OF STUFF?

1412
01:13:29,505 --> 01:13:34,009
AND THERE YOU ARE,
FATHER AND SON.

1413
01:13:34,009 --> 01:13:37,012
<i>HASKELL'S KIND OF
LIKE MY GODFATHER.</i>

1414
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:40,515
UM, I SOMEHOW FEEL
A BOND TO YOUR DAD

1415
01:13:40,516 --> 01:13:43,620
THAT IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER
RELATIONSHIP I HAVE WITH,

1416
01:13:43,621 --> 01:13:44,421
YOU KNOW--

1417
01:13:44,520 --> 01:13:47,022
IT'S FUNNY, BECAUSE
I FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT YOUR DAD.

1418
01:13:47,022 --> 01:13:50,525
IN FACT, I ALWAYS TELL KATE,
"I WISH YOUR DAD WERE MY DAD.

1419
01:13:50,526 --> 01:13:54,029
I WISH I HAD HIM AS A DAD".
OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE--

1420
01:13:54,029 --> 01:13:57,032
I TOLD MY DAD,
YOU KNOW--

1421
01:13:57,032 --> 01:14:01,536
<i>I'M WORRIED ABOUT YOUR
FILM. I HOPE THE FILM REALLY</i>

1422
01:14:01,537 --> 01:14:06,542
<i>DEALS WITH THINGS</i>
<i>BEYOND THE BUSINESS,</i> <i>SO TO SPEAK.</i>

1423
01:14:06,542 --> 01:14:09,044
<i>UM, AND-AND--</i>

1424
01:14:09,044 --> 01:14:11,046
SO HAVE YOU BEEN THINKING
ABOUT THAT A LOT?

1425
01:14:11,046 --> 01:14:15,050
QUESTIONS IN YOUR LIFE
THAT GO BEYOND YOUR CAREER?

1426
01:14:15,050 --> 01:14:20,055
ARE THOSE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN
GOING ON IN YOUR MIND RECENTLY?

1427
01:14:20,055 --> 01:14:22,057
<i>UH, YEAH. I--</i>

1428
01:14:22,057 --> 01:14:25,560
<i>ONE OF THE BIG THINGS THAT'S GOING
ON IN MY MIND VERY RECENTLY

1429
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:30,065
<i>IS BEING WITH CONRAD HALL,</i>
<i>KNOWING THAT HE'S GOT CANCER,</i>

1430
01:14:30,065 --> 01:14:34,069
<i>AND KNOWING THAT</i>
<i>I'M 80-AND-A-HALF YEARS OLD--</i>

1431
01:14:34,069 --> 01:14:36,571
<i>OR ALMOST 81, ACTUALLY.</i>

1432
01:14:36,572 --> 01:14:41,076
<i>SO I THINK</i>
<i>ABOUT MORTALITY.</i>

1433
01:14:41,076 --> 01:14:42,580
<i>I'VE BEEN
ASKED TO REMIND YOU</i>

1434
01:14:42,581 --> 01:14:44,981
<i>THAT THOSE PUMPKINS ARE FOR SALE.</i>

1435
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,082
<i>LET'S NOT FORGET--</i>
<i>HALLOWEEN IS COMING!</i>

1436
01:14:47,082 --> 01:14:52,087
HONEY, DO WE WANT TO BUY
A PUMPKIN, I THINK?

1437
01:14:52,087 --> 01:14:54,589
I'D LIKE TO BUY
A PUMPKIN.

1438
01:14:54,590 --> 01:14:58,093
<i>WHEN I SIT ON CONRAD'S
BED AND HOLD HIS HAND</i>

1439
01:14:58,093 --> 01:15:01,596
<i>AND JUST TALK</i>
<i>TO HIM ABOUT--</i>

1440
01:15:01,597 --> 01:15:05,100
<i>ABOUT OUR LIVES,</i>
<i>ABOUT FILMMAKING</i> <i>AND SO FORTH,</i>

1441
01:15:05,100 --> 01:15:09,104
<i>I THINK ABOUT HOW CONRAD IS
SINCE WE'RE MAKING THIS FILM--</i>

1442
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:12,107
<i>HOW CONRAD IS</i>
<i>WITH HIS FAMILY,</i> <i>WITH HIS KIDS.</i>

1443
01:15:12,107 --> 01:15:17,112
I THINK THAT CONRAD
WAS ABLE TO DO

1444
01:15:17,112 --> 01:15:20,615
BETTER, MUCH BETTER,
THAN I DID.

1445
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:25,221
<i>DID YOU HAVE</i>
<i>GIRLFRIENDS WHEN YOU WERE</i>

1446
01:15:25,222 --> 01:15:26,022
<i>MARRIED TO MY MOTHER?</i>

1447
01:15:26,121 --> 01:15:28,623
OH, YEAH.

1448
01:15:28,624 --> 01:15:31,126
<i>I, UH,</i>

1449
01:15:31,126 --> 01:15:33,128
<i>WAS PROBABLY</i>

1450
01:15:33,128 --> 01:15:38,133
<i>CONSIDERED AN ACTIVE MALE,</i>
<i>BUT NOT ACTIVE</i>

1451
01:15:38,133 --> 01:15:41,636
WITH MY HEART, REALLY.

1452
01:15:43,138 --> 01:15:45,140
<i>SHE...</i>

1453
01:15:45,140 --> 01:15:48,643
<i>SUSPECTED SOMETHING ONCE,</i>

1454
01:15:48,644 --> 01:15:51,146
<i>AND, UM,</i>
<i>I DISSUADED HER,</i>

1455
01:15:51,146 --> 01:15:53,648
<i>BECAUSE WHAT SHE SUSPECTED</i>

1456
01:15:53,649 --> 01:15:56,652
<i>WAS NOTHING THAT MEANT</i>
<i>ANYTHING TO ME.</i>

1457
01:15:58,153 --> 01:16:00,655
<i>HASKELL!</i>

1458
01:16:00,656 --> 01:16:02,157
<i>AH! JESUS!</i>

1459
01:16:02,157 --> 01:16:04,159
- OH MY GOD!
- <i>HI, JANE.</i>

1460
01:16:08,664 --> 01:16:12,668
SO, HOW ARE YOU
AFTER A THOUSAND YEARS?

1461
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:16,171
<i>I CANNOT BELIEVE</i>
<i>HOW</i> NOT <i>MELLOWED HE SEEMS.</i>

1462
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:19,174
<i>HE SEEMS EXACTLY</i>
<i>THE SAME ENERGETICALLY,</i>

1463
01:16:19,174 --> 01:16:23,178
<i>IN HIS KIND OF SPARKLE AND SENSE
OF HUMOR, THE WAY HE LOOKS--

1464
01:16:23,178 --> 01:16:26,583
AND MY KID IS TRYING
TO MAKE ME CRAZY

1465
01:16:26,584 --> 01:16:28,084
BY SHOOTING THIS DOCUMENTARY.

1466
01:16:28,183 --> 01:16:30,685
<i>I'M VERY SURPRISED</i>
<i>THAT HE HASN'T CHANGED MORE.</i>

1467
01:16:30,686 --> 01:16:32,688
TROY'S HERE!

1468
01:16:32,688 --> 01:16:34,491
SOMEBODY THAT HELPED
CHANGE YOUR DIAPERS IS HERE,

1469
01:16:34,492 --> 01:16:36,092
WHEN YOU'RE OFF THE PHONE.

1470
01:16:36,191 --> 01:16:39,194
SO YOU CHANGED
MY DIAPERS, HUH?

1471
01:16:39,194 --> 01:16:40,297
<i>WHEN TROY WAS BORN,</i>

1472
01:16:40,298 --> 01:16:42,698
<i>IT WAS A TIME OF
TREMENDOUS CONTROVERSY,</i>

1473
01:16:42,698 --> 01:16:45,701
<i>AND TOM HAYDEN AND I DECIDED
NOT TO BURDEN HIM WITH THE BAGGAGE

1474
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:48,203
OF EITHER THE NAME
FONDA OR HAYDEN.

1475
01:16:48,203 --> 01:16:50,705
SO WE GAVE HIM THE NAME
OF HIS PATERNAL GRANDMOTHER,

1476
01:16:50,706 --> 01:16:53,208
<i>HER MAIDEN NAME,</i>
<i>GARITY.</i>

1477
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:54,712
I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT

1478
01:16:54,713 --> 01:16:57,113
YOU'RE A GROWN
PERSON WITH ALL THAT TALENT.

1479
01:16:57,212 --> 01:17:01,216
<i>SO HE-- HE HAS</i> <i>HIS OWN NAME.</i>

1480
01:17:01,216 --> 01:17:04,219
WE'RE JUST GONNA TALK
FOR A WHILE, AND THEN--

1481
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:06,721
IF THEY NEED
AN OLD CAMERAMAN

1482
01:17:06,722 --> 01:17:08,724
ON ANY OF YOUR JOBS,
NOW, GIVE ME A CALL.

1483
01:17:08,724 --> 01:17:10,726
- OH, YEAH.
- <i>OKAY. OKAY.</i>

1484
01:17:10,726 --> 01:17:14,730
<i>MY FATHER CAME OUT
OF AN IRISH BACKGROUND</i>

1485
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:18,233
AND WAS A MARINE
IN WORLD WAR ll

1486
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:21,736
<i>AND BECAME DEEPLY</i>
<i>DEPRESSED AND ANGRY</i>

1487
01:17:21,737 --> 01:17:24,740
<i>AT MY RADICAL</i>
<i>REBELLION AND JOURNEY,</i>

1488
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:28,243
<i>AND FOR ABOUT 16 YEARS,</i>
<i>DENIED THAT I WAS HIS SON,</i>

1489
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:30,245
<i>NEVER TALKED TO ME.</i>

1490
01:17:30,245 --> 01:17:33,748
ONE DAY HIS NEW WIFE YELLED
AT HIM, "YOU STUBBORN IRISHMAN!

1491
01:17:33,749 --> 01:17:35,751
WHY DON'T YOU PICK UP
THE PHONE AND CALL TOM?"

1492
01:17:35,751 --> 01:17:37,753
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,

1493
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:40,255
I WAS MARRIED
AND I HAD A CHILD--

1494
01:17:40,255 --> 01:17:41,756
UM, A SMALL CHILD, TROY.

1495
01:17:41,757 --> 01:17:45,260
<i>THE CHILDREN OF</i>
<i>THESE KINDS OF PARENTS</i>

1496
01:17:45,260 --> 01:17:48,763
<i>SPEND THE REST OF OUR LIVES</i>
<i>HEALING FROM THAT.</i>

1497
01:17:48,764 --> 01:17:52,267
AND THE IMPORTANT THING
IS TO UNDERSTAND

1498
01:17:52,267 --> 01:17:54,769
THAT IT'S SOMETHING
THAT <i>HE</i> INHERITED--

1499
01:17:54,770 --> 01:17:56,772
YOU CAN BE SURE
HIS FATHER WAS THE SAME--

1500
01:17:56,772 --> 01:17:59,576
<i>AND THAT WE HAVE TO
UNDERSTAND AND FORGIVE THEM.

1501
01:17:59,577 --> 01:18:00,677
<i>IT'S NOT HIS FAULT.

1502
01:18:00,776 --> 01:18:03,779
<i>THE MOST IMPORTANT</i> <i>THING FOR ME</i>

1503
01:18:03,779 --> 01:18:07,783
<i>IS TO BECOME</i>
<i>A USEFUL ELDER TO MY KIDS.</i>

1504
01:18:07,783 --> 01:18:11,286
<i>AND PART OF BECOMING</i>
<i>A USEFUL ELDER IS</i>

1505
01:18:11,286 --> 01:18:15,790
CUTTING OFF THE TOXIC
TRANSMISSION OF...

1506
01:18:17,793 --> 01:18:22,297
ALL OF THESE COMPLEXES THAT
ARE PASSED FROM FATHER TO SON,

1507
01:18:22,297 --> 01:18:27,302
<i>IT'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR
MEN OF OUR FATHERS' GENERATION.</i>

1508
01:18:27,302 --> 01:18:30,805
INTIMACY WAS NOT
THEIR GIFT.

1509
01:18:34,810 --> 01:18:36,812
THEY'RE BOTH...

1510
01:18:37,813 --> 01:18:40,315
EMPATHIC PEOPLE.

1511
01:18:40,315 --> 01:18:42,317
YOU COULDN'T BE THE KIND
OF ACTOR MY FATHER WAS

1512
01:18:42,317 --> 01:18:44,319
OR THE KIND
OF CINEMATOGRAPHER

1513
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:46,821
AND DOCUMENTARIAN
THAT YOUR FATHER IS

1514
01:18:46,822 --> 01:18:48,824
WITHOUT BEING EMPATHIC,

1515
01:18:48,824 --> 01:18:50,826
BUT INTIMACY SCARES THEM.

1516
01:18:50,826 --> 01:18:54,329
HOW LONG HAS IT BEEN SINCE YOU'VE
SEEN <i>INTRODUCTION TO THE ENEMY?</i>

1517
01:18:54,329 --> 01:18:57,332
I HAVEN'T SEEN IT
IN A LONG TIME.

1518
01:18:59,835 --> 01:19:02,838
- HAVE YOU?
- OH, I-- YEAH, YEAH.

1519
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:08,343
<i>IN 1974, TOM HAYDEN,</i>
<i>MY HUSBAND AT THE TIME,</i>

1520
01:19:08,343 --> 01:19:11,547
<i>DECIDED WITH ME THAT WE</i>
<i>WANTED TO DO A FILM CALLED</i>

1521
01:19:11,548 --> 01:19:12,848
INTRODUCTION TO THE ENEMY

1522
01:19:12,848 --> 01:19:17,352
<i>THAT WOULD HUMANIZE</i>
<i>THE VIETNAMESE.</i>

1523
01:19:17,352 --> 01:19:23,358
<i>AND HASKELL SEEMED LIKE</i>
<i>THE PERFECT PERSON TO FILM IT.</i>

1524
01:19:23,358 --> 01:19:25,860
<i>BEING IN HANOI NOW</i>

1525
01:19:25,861 --> 01:19:28,864
<i>IS LIKE SEEING A CITY</i>
<i>THAT'S COME BACK TO LIFE.</i>

1526
01:19:28,864 --> 01:19:34,369
<i>PARTLY BECAUSE OF HIS
GIFT AS A DOCUMENTARIAN</i>

1527
01:19:34,369 --> 01:19:36,871
<i>AND ALSO BECAUSE</i>
<i>OF HIS VALUES</i>

1528
01:19:36,872 --> 01:19:39,875
<i>AS A HUMAN BEING.</i>

1529
01:19:39,875 --> 01:19:44,880
<i>IT WAS VERY CRUDE, AND WE DID GO
ACROSS THE D.M.Z. INTO THE SOUTH,</i>

1530
01:19:44,880 --> 01:19:47,382
<i>AND IT WAS DIFFICULT.</i>

1531
01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:51,886
AND, UM, IT WAS
MOVING FOR ME TO

1532
01:19:51,887 --> 01:19:55,390
WATCH HASKELL
UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES.

1533
01:19:55,390 --> 01:19:57,892
I MEAN, HASKELL
COMES FROM

1534
01:19:57,893 --> 01:20:00,896
<i>A PRIVILEGED PLACE</i>
<i>IN SOCIETY.</i>

1535
01:20:00,896 --> 01:20:04,399
<i>HE COMES FROM MONEY. HE'S BEEN
ABLE TO LIVE WELL ALL HIS LIFE.

1536
01:20:04,399 --> 01:20:07,902
<i>AND FOR PEOPLE LIKE US--</i>

1537
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:10,906
<i>HASKELL AND ME, 'CAUSE I</i>
<i>ALSO COME FROM PRIVILEGE--</i>

1538
01:20:10,906 --> 01:20:14,409
<i>THERE'S ALWAYS</i>
<i>A TENSION BETWEEN, UM,</i>

1539
01:20:14,409 --> 01:20:19,914
HOW WE LIVE AND WHAT WE ARE ABLE
TO DO BECAUSE OF OUR CLASS AND RACE

1540
01:20:19,915 --> 01:20:22,918
<i>UP AGAINST PEOPLE</i>
<i>WHO ARE NOT PRIVILEGED.</i>

1541
01:20:22,918 --> 01:20:24,920
<i>AND THAT WAS CERTAINLY</i>
<i>THE CASE IN VIETNAM.</i>

1542
01:20:24,920 --> 01:20:29,424
WHEN DID YOU DECIDE TO, UH,
JOIN THE RESISTANCE, AND WHY?

1543
01:20:32,427 --> 01:20:35,430
<i>AND I JUST REMEMBER ONE DAY
HE CAME DOWN TO BREAKFAST</i>

1544
01:20:35,430 --> 01:20:38,433
<i>AND HE SAID, "HOW--</i>
<i>HOW HAVE YOU DONE IT?</i>

1545
01:20:38,433 --> 01:20:42,437
<i>HOW HAVE YOU JUST</i>
<i>GIVEN IT ALL UP?"</i>

1546
01:20:42,437 --> 01:20:46,441
<i>AND I DON'T REMEMBER</i>
<i>WHAT I SAID,</i>

1547
01:20:46,441 --> 01:20:49,444
<i>BUT OF COURSE I HADN'T</i>
<i>GIVEN IT ALL UP ANYWAY.</i>

1548
01:20:49,444 --> 01:20:50,548
<i>BUT I WAS SO TOUCHED

1549
01:20:50,549 --> 01:20:53,349
THAT HE WAS SEARCHING
THAT WAY WITHIN HIMSELF.

1550
01:20:53,448 --> 01:20:54,949
THAT'S THE KIND
OF PERSON HE IS.

1551
01:21:03,458 --> 01:21:07,462
<i>OH, MY GOD. THERE'S
SO MUCH. YOU MISS HAL?</i>

1552
01:21:07,462 --> 01:21:09,464
<i>I DO, VERY MUCH.</i>

1553
01:21:09,464 --> 01:21:11,966
<i>YOU WERE SUCH</i>
<i>AN INCREDIBLE PARTNERSHIP.</i>

1554
01:21:11,967 --> 01:21:15,470
<i>HIS STYLE</i>
<i>AND YOUR STYLE</i>

1555
01:21:15,470 --> 01:21:18,473
WAS SO SYNCHRONISTIC.

1556
01:21:18,473 --> 01:21:20,475
YEAH, I REALLY
MISS HIM.

1557
01:21:20,475 --> 01:21:22,477
<i>WASN'T THAT FUN,</i>
<i>THAT MOVIE,</i> COMING HOME?

1558
01:21:22,477 --> 01:21:24,979
<i>IN</i> COMING HOME,
<i>I THINK</i> <i>I REMEMBER CORRECTLY</i>

1559
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:28,483
<i>WHEN WE HAD THE NAKED SCENE
IN BED...</i> -<i>OH, GOD, YES.</i>

1560
01:21:28,483 --> 01:21:31,986
<i>AND I REMEMBER</i>
<i>ON "CUT,"</i>

1561
01:21:31,987 --> 01:21:34,990
<i>YOU GOT UP AND WENT TO THE PHONE
AND TALKED TO CESAR CHAVEZ.

1562
01:21:34,990 --> 01:21:37,492
I DON'T REMEMBER THAT!

1563
01:21:37,492 --> 01:21:39,595
YOU JUST FINISHED MAKING
THESE ORGIASTIC SOUNDS,

1564
01:21:39,596 --> 01:21:40,996
AND THEY PUT A BATHROBE--

1565
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:43,999
"OH, HI, CESAR". -YEAH.

1566
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:47,502
AS YOU CAN SEE,
AFTER FIVE YEARS, WE GET DOWN.

1567
01:21:47,502 --> 01:21:49,504
- WE JUST GO RIGHT DOWN THERE.
- RIGHT!

1568
01:21:49,504 --> 01:21:51,005
WE GO RIGHT TO IT.

1569
01:21:51,006 --> 01:21:54,509
COULD YOU TAKE
THIS THING OFF OF ME? AND ALSO,

1570
01:21:54,509 --> 01:21:57,512
I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
I HAVE NOT SIGNED A RELEASE FOR HIM,

1571
01:21:57,512 --> 01:22:01,516
SO BEFORE HE FINISHES
THIS FILM,

1572
01:22:01,516 --> 01:22:04,519
IF THERE'S ANYTHING--
IF THERE'S ANYTHING

1573
01:22:04,519 --> 01:22:08,523
THAT I DON'T LIKE
OR YOU DON'T LIKE, OUTSVILLE.

1574
01:22:08,523 --> 01:22:11,526
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW, HE'S
A VERY CONSERVATIVE PERSON.

1575
01:22:11,526 --> 01:22:14,529
<i>ACTUALLY, BEFORE I TAKE
THAT OFF, HOLD ON ONE SECOND.</i>

1576
01:22:14,529 --> 01:22:16,030
<i>YES, MARK.</i>

1577
01:22:16,031 --> 01:22:18,533
<i>MARK, THIS IS</i>
<i>CINEMA VERITE.</i>

1578
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:22,036
<i>THIS IS SO IMPORTANT.</i>
<i>THIS IS SO IMPORTANT TO HIM.</i>

1579
01:22:22,037 --> 01:22:24,341
AND IT'S NOT EASY, 'CAUSE HE'S
TRODDING INTO YOUR WORLD NOW,

1580
01:22:24,342 --> 01:22:25,942
AND HE'S SCARED TO DEATH.

1581
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:28,543
YEAH.
YOU NOTICED THAT?

1582
01:22:28,543 --> 01:22:31,546
- I GIVE HIM A HARD TIME.
- THAT'S GOOD.

1583
01:22:31,546 --> 01:22:34,048
<i>MOST PEOPLE
PERFORM IN RELATIONSHIP</i>

1584
01:22:34,049 --> 01:22:35,550
<i>TO THEIR PARENTS</i>
<i>OR THEIR CHILDREN.</i>

1585
01:22:35,550 --> 01:22:37,552
<i>THEY'RE NOT HONEST.</i>

1586
01:22:37,552 --> 01:22:40,054
THEY ACT HONEST TO YOU
RATHER THAN BEING HONEST,

1587
01:22:40,055 --> 01:22:44,059
SO WHATEVER MY ADVICE IS,
WHATEVER SOMEBODY TELLS YOU

1588
01:22:44,059 --> 01:22:47,062
AS THE HONEST ANSWER
TO A QUESTION,

1589
01:22:47,062 --> 01:22:51,566
GO DEEPER, BECAUSE
IT'S MORE LIKELY TO BE A FRONT--

1590
01:22:51,566 --> 01:22:53,570
UNCONSCIOUSLY, A FRONT--

1591
01:22:53,571 --> 01:22:55,571
FOR WHAT THEY REALLY
DON'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT.

1592
01:22:58,073 --> 01:23:01,576
<i>HAVE YOU DONE OTHER
SHOOTING OF MARIAN HERE?</i>

1593
01:23:01,576 --> 01:23:03,578
<i>UH, SOME STILLS.</i>

1594
01:23:09,584 --> 01:23:11,589
<i>I'D LIKE TO BRING MY MOTHER OUT

1595
01:23:11,590 --> 01:23:14,590
<i>IN THE WHEELCHAIR IN HERE
FOR THIS AIR.</i>

1596
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:20,095
YOU SURE SHE'LL BE
WARM ENOUGH? -<i>HUH?</i>

1597
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:21,596
I HOPE
SHE'LL BE WARM ENOUGH.

1598
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:36,111
THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

1599
01:23:36,111 --> 01:23:37,612
HERE, I GOT IT.

1600
01:23:40,115 --> 01:23:44,119
<i>HI. HI, MOM.</i>

1601
01:23:44,119 --> 01:23:47,122
- HOW ARE YOU?
- <i>HOW ARE YOU?</i>

1602
01:23:47,122 --> 01:23:51,126
HI, MARE. HI, MARE, IT'S
HASKELL. HOW ARE YOU, HONEY?

1603
01:23:55,130 --> 01:24:00,635
HOW ARE YOU, MARIAN? SO MARK
IS HERE TAKING YOUR PICTURE.

1604
01:24:00,635 --> 01:24:05,640
HE'S TAKING YOUR PICTURE.

1605
01:24:05,640 --> 01:24:08,142
WE'RE JUST GONNA GET SOMETHING
TO MAKE YOU A LITTLE WARMER.

1606
01:24:08,143 --> 01:24:11,146
LET'S PUT
YOUR SWEATER ON.

1607
01:24:11,146 --> 01:24:14,649
LITTLE BIT CHILLY
THIS MORNING.

1608
01:24:14,649 --> 01:24:17,151
THERE, WE GET THIS
OVER HER.

1609
01:24:21,156 --> 01:24:25,160
IT'S A COOL DAY.
I WAS IN CHICAGO YESTERDAY,

1610
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:30,665
<i>AND, UM, I WENT BY,</i>
<i>THE WILMETTE THEATER,</i>

1611
01:24:30,665 --> 01:24:33,668
<i>WHICH IS</i>
<i>NO LONGER THERE.</i>

1612
01:24:33,668 --> 01:24:38,673
<i>AND, UH, UNCLE PETE'S
HOUSE IS TORN DOWN.

1613
01:24:38,673 --> 01:24:42,176
AND THE WILMETTE'S
ALL DIFFERENT NOW.

1614
01:24:44,679 --> 01:24:48,182
REMEMBER WE USED TO GO--
WE WENT TO DIMETRI'S

1615
01:24:48,183 --> 01:24:50,185
AND WE GOT SANDWICHES?

1616
01:24:54,689 --> 01:24:57,692
WE RODE ON
THE OUTER DRIVE.

1617
01:25:22,217 --> 01:25:26,221
WE'VE GOT SECRETS.
WE'VE GOT SECRETS.

1618
01:25:29,724 --> 01:25:32,226
WE KNOW THINGS--
YOU, ME.

1619
01:25:32,227 --> 01:25:37,732
WE KNOW THINGS
ABOUT EACH OTHER.

1620
01:25:37,732 --> 01:25:40,234
I KNOW.

1621
01:25:40,235 --> 01:25:43,738
YES, THAT NOBODY ELSE
IN THE WORLD KNOWS.

1622
01:26:05,260 --> 01:26:07,262
<i>DAD, I JUST WANT YOU</i>
<i>TO KNOW THAT I'M NOT--</i>

1623
01:26:07,262 --> 01:26:09,764
<i>I ALWAYS FELT THAT YOU
THOUGHT THAT I WAS MAD AT YOU</i>

1624
01:26:09,764 --> 01:26:13,267
<i>ABOUT BREAKING UP WITH MY MOM,
AND I'M NOT MAD ANYMORE.</i>

1625
01:26:13,268 --> 01:26:18,273
GOOD. I KNEW YOU DID,
AND THAT BOTHERED ME.

1626
01:26:18,273 --> 01:26:23,278
BREAKING UP
OR STOP BEING MARRIED

1627
01:26:23,278 --> 01:26:25,780
AND SO FORTH
AFTER THAT MANY YEARS--

1628
01:26:25,780 --> 01:26:27,782
AND NOT--

1629
01:26:27,782 --> 01:26:31,285
NOT, LIKE,
BAD YEARS, YOU KNOW?

1630
01:26:31,286 --> 01:26:35,290
ALL I CAN--
ALL I CAN THINK OF

1631
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:39,294
WHEN I WAS TALKING TO HER
WAS HOW MUCH ENJOYMENT,

1632
01:26:39,294 --> 01:26:43,298
HOW MUCH PLEASURE
WE GAVE EACH OTHER.

1633
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:50,805
<i>YOUR MOTHER WAS</i>
<i>AN INCREDIBLY GOOD ARTIST.</i>

1634
01:26:50,805 --> 01:26:57,812
<i>I WAS THINKING--</i>
<i>WE WERE ON A LAKE</i> <i>IN GUATEMALA.</i>

1635
01:26:57,812 --> 01:27:00,314
<i>LAKE PANAJACHEL.</i>
<i>SHE WOULD PAINT</i>

1636
01:27:00,315 --> 01:27:04,319
<i>AND I WOULD SHOOT,</i>
<i>AND, UM,</i>

1637
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:07,322
<i>IT WAS LIKE--</i>

1638
01:27:07,322 --> 01:27:11,326
IT WAS LOVE, YOU KNOW?

1639
01:27:13,828 --> 01:27:16,831
<i>WHAT HAPPENED TO IT?</i>

1640
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:21,336
<i>ALL I CAN JUST SAY IS,</i>

1641
01:27:21,336 --> 01:27:26,341
<i>PEOPLE LOOK FOR DIFFERENT</i>
<i>THINGS IN THEIR LIFE.</i>

1642
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:30,845
<i>IT'S HARD TO PUT BLAME</i>
<i>ON ME JUST</i>

1643
01:27:30,845 --> 01:27:34,849
<i>WANTING TO BE</i>
<i>A BIG-SHOT CAMERAMAN</i>

1644
01:27:34,849 --> 01:27:38,853
<i>AND MARIAN NOT BEING</i>
<i>WITH IT, OR--</i>

1645
01:27:38,853 --> 01:27:41,355
<i>YOU KNOW, IT'S HARD TO--</i>
<i>IT'S NONE OF THOSE THINGS.</i>

1646
01:27:41,356 --> 01:27:45,360
<i>IT'S THOSE-- IT'S THOSE</i>
<i>SUBTLE HUMAN THINGS THAT--</i>

1647
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:49,364
<i>THAT WE SELDOM REALLY...</i>
<i>UNDERSTAND.</i>

1648
01:27:52,367 --> 01:27:55,370
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK, MARK?
WHAT'S-- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

1649
01:27:55,370 --> 01:27:58,373
AND HOW ARE YOU
GONNA DIFFERENTIATE

1650
01:27:58,373 --> 01:28:01,376
THIS... THING,

1651
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:04,379
THIS <i>SCENE</i> THAT HAPPENED?

1652
01:28:04,379 --> 01:28:10,385
BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE CAMERA,
AND IN A SENSE, IT, UM--

1653
01:28:10,385 --> 01:28:13,388
IN A SENSE,
IT COLORS A SITUATION.

1654
01:28:13,388 --> 01:28:15,390
I HAVE TO TELL YOU,
FOR MYSELF,

1655
01:28:15,390 --> 01:28:18,393
I KNEW YOUR CAMERA WAS THERE,
BUT I DIDN'T GIVE A SHIT.

1656
01:28:18,393 --> 01:28:22,397
I MEAN--
AND I THINK THAT, UM--

1657
01:28:25,900 --> 01:28:27,902
AND NOW I'M THINKING,

1658
01:28:27,902 --> 01:28:32,406
"WELL, MAYBE THE CAMERA
SORT OF INVADED

1659
01:28:32,407 --> 01:28:35,910
SOMETHING DEEPLY
PERSONAL TO ME".

1660
01:28:35,910 --> 01:28:39,914
AND THEN
I SHOULD SAY, WELL,

1661
01:28:39,914 --> 01:28:42,917
"SO WHAT?"
YOU KNOW? SO WHAT?

1662
01:28:42,917 --> 01:28:48,923
<i>IT DIDN'T STOP</i>
<i>THE REAL THING.</i>

1663
01:28:48,923 --> 01:28:51,926
<i>I APPRECIATE YOU</i>
<i>TRUSTING ME WITH THAT.</i>

1664
01:29:09,944 --> 01:29:13,447
SO WHAT WE DO IS,
WE WRITE IT ALL UP

1665
01:29:13,448 --> 01:29:17,952
AND OF COURSE,
WE'LL TALK NUMBERS AND WHAT,

1666
01:29:17,952 --> 01:29:19,954
GIVE YOU AN IDEA
OF WHAT WE THINK

1667
01:29:19,954 --> 01:29:23,457
CERTAIN GEAR WOULD BE SELLING
FOR NOW ON THE CURRENT MARKET--

1668
01:29:23,458 --> 01:29:26,461
<i>IT WAS A BIG MOMENT
FOR HASKELL TO</i> DEPART,

1669
01:29:26,461 --> 01:29:29,964
TO CONSIDER SELLING
HIS CAMERA GEAR.

1670
01:29:29,964 --> 01:29:31,966
IT'S ALWAYS
SO CLOSE TO HIM.

1671
01:29:31,966 --> 01:29:34,468
SO LIKE YOU SAID,
HE WAS MENTALLY NOT PREPARED.

1672
01:29:34,469 --> 01:29:36,971
NOW, YOU SEE
SOMETHING LIKE THIS--

1673
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:40,975
I MEAN, THIS KIND OF THING
HAS GOT TO BE SOLD WITH-WITH LOVE,

1674
01:29:40,975 --> 01:29:45,980
'CAUSE THIS INCREDIBLE CAMERA
HAD THIS MOTOR ADAPTED TO IT.

1675
01:29:45,980 --> 01:29:48,983
<i>I MEAN, YOU WILL MAKE</i>
<i>THE MOST BEAUTIFUL PICTURES--</i>

1676
01:29:48,983 --> 01:29:51,986
I'LL TAKE A COUPLE
OF LIGHT ONES. I LEARNED THAT--

1677
01:29:51,986 --> 01:29:53,988
TO GRAB THE SMALL CASES.

1678
01:29:53,988 --> 01:29:56,490
<i>AND WHEN I LOOK</i> <i>AT HASKELL,</i>

1679
01:29:56,491 --> 01:29:59,994
<i>I SEE A TORTURED SOUL,</i>

1680
01:29:59,994 --> 01:30:03,497
BECAUSE HE KNOWS IT'S CLOSE
TO THE END OF THE LINE

1681
01:30:03,498 --> 01:30:06,000
IN TERMS OF WORK.

1682
01:30:06,000 --> 01:30:08,502
BUT FOR YEARS,
I SAW THIS.

1683
01:30:08,503 --> 01:30:12,507
<i>HE'S GOT TO DO MORE.</i>
<i>HE'S GOT TO DO BETTER.</i>

1684
01:30:12,507 --> 01:30:14,509
<i>HE SHOULD HAVE BEEN</i>
<i>A DIRECTOR.</i>

1685
01:30:14,509 --> 01:30:18,012
<i>HE COULD HAVE SHOWN</i>
<i>THESE GUYS HOW TO DO IT.</i>

1686
01:30:18,012 --> 01:30:21,515
<i>IT'S ALL "SHOULD'VE".</i>
<i>AND THE SHOULD'VES</i>

1687
01:30:21,516 --> 01:30:24,018
ARE A CURSE.

1688
01:30:40,535 --> 01:30:45,540
<i>MARK AND I HAVE HAD</i>
<i>OUR DIFFERENCES IN LIFE,</i>

1689
01:30:45,540 --> 01:30:50,044
AND CONRAD WAS SORT OF
A FOSTER FATHER TO MARK

1690
01:30:50,044 --> 01:30:52,546
AND A REALLY
GENUINELY GOOD GUY,

1691
01:30:52,547 --> 01:30:54,549
AND I KNOW-- I SUSPECT
WHY HE WAS:

1692
01:30:54,549 --> 01:30:57,552
<i>'CAUSE MARK AND CONRAD</i>
<i>LAUGHED TOGETHER.</i>

1693
01:30:57,552 --> 01:31:01,055
<i>I LOOKED AT 'EM ONCE TALKING,</i>
<i>AND I SAID TO MYSELF,</i> <i>"GODDAMN IT,</i>

1694
01:31:01,055 --> 01:31:03,057
HE LIKES CONRAD MORE
THAN HE LIKES ME".

1695
01:31:05,560 --> 01:31:11,566
IT IS TRUE, NOT EVERYONE CAN
BE ALL THINGS TO ALL PEOPLE.

1696
01:31:11,566 --> 01:31:15,069
<i>I CAN TELL</i>
<i>THAT HE LOVES YOU,</i>

1697
01:31:15,069 --> 01:31:19,073
<i>AND HE IS SCARED OF</i>
<i>WHAT YOU MAY DO TO HIM</i>

1698
01:31:19,073 --> 01:31:20,574
OR EXPOSE IN HIM
IN THIS FILM.

1699
01:31:22,577 --> 01:31:25,580
<i>I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S</i>
<i>ANYTHING MORE IMPORTANT</i>

1700
01:31:25,580 --> 01:31:29,583
<i>THAN MAKING PEACE</i>
<i>BEFORE IT'S TOO LATE.</i>

1701
01:31:32,587 --> 01:31:36,591
<i>MAYBE I'M TOO TIGHT.</i>
<i>THIS IS HARD TO FOCUS.</i>

1702
01:31:36,591 --> 01:31:40,094
<i>AND IT ALMOST ALWAYS
RELIES ON THE CHILD</i>

1703
01:31:40,094 --> 01:31:42,096
<i>TO MOVE</i> TO <i>THE PARENT.</i>

1704
01:31:42,096 --> 01:31:45,599
IF YOU JUST SET
THE FOCUS RIGHT HERE

1705
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:47,602
AND THEN MEET ME
WITH THE ZOOM--

1706
01:31:47,602 --> 01:31:50,605
NEVER MIND CHANGING
FOCUS AT ALL. -<i>OKAY. OKAY.</i>

1707
01:31:50,605 --> 01:31:53,608
- OKAY?
- <i>BUT JUST BE PATIENT.</i>

1708
01:31:58,613 --> 01:32:01,616
'CAUSE THAT SPEAKS VOLUMES.

1709
01:32:01,616 --> 01:32:04,118
AND IT'S AN INVITATION.
PATIENCE IS ALWAYS AN INVITATION.

1710
01:32:04,118 --> 01:32:06,120
<i>OKAY.</i>

1711
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:10,124
<i>BECAUSE IT'S FILLED</i> <i>WITH SUCH HOPE.</i>

1712
01:32:13,628 --> 01:32:15,630
<i>AH. THAT'S BETTER.</i>
