00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:22,260
(* The Gabe Dixon Band: Find My Way)

00:00:27,707 --> 00:00:30,676
(birds chirping)

3
00:01:20,993 --> 00:01:22,894
Shit!

4
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:45,073
(indistinct chattering)

5
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:47,417
Andrew, hey.

6
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:51,914
Here you go. Your regular lattes.

7
00:01:51,957 --> 00:01:56,156
Literally saved my life.
Thank you. Thank you.

8
00:01:57,164 --> 00:01:58,960
(honking)

9
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:10,771
(elevator dinging)

10
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:11,868
- Everyone OK?
- Yeah.

11
00:02:11,912 --> 00:02:14,175
- Yeah.
- Me too.

12
00:02:15,615 --> 00:02:18,913
Hello, Frank? How's my favorite writer?

13
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:20,612
Of course you've been
thinking about our talk

14
00:02:20,653 --> 00:02:22,314
because you know I'm right.

15
00:02:22,354 --> 00:02:24,254
Frank, people in this
country are busy, broke,

16
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:26,384
and they hate to read.
They need someone they can trust to say,

17
00:02:26,425 --> 00:02:28,758
"Hey! Don't watch
CSl: Indianapolis tonight.

18
00:02:28,795 --> 00:02:32,195
Read a book! Read Frank's book."
And that person is Oprah.

19
00:02:35,534 --> 00:02:37,502
(indistinct chatter)

20
00:02:37,537 --> 00:02:39,265
- Cuttin' it close.
- One of those mornings.

21
00:02:39,305 --> 00:02:40,795
Thank you, Captain Obvious.

22
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:43,104
- (both grunting)
- Sweet...

23
00:02:43,143 --> 00:02:44,804
- Uh, sorry.
...Jesus!

24
00:02:44,844 --> 00:02:46,745
- (laughter)
- (man) Rub some dirt on it, brother.

25
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:50,237
Frank, the truth is all
A-plus novelists do publicity.

26
00:02:51,183 --> 00:02:53,981
Roth, McCourt, Russo, and...

27
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,920
Frank! Can I tell you what else
they have in common? A Pulitzer.

28
00:02:57,623 --> 00:02:59,557
I need the shirt off
your back. Literally.

29
00:02:59,593 --> 00:03:03,050
- You're kidding, right?
- Yankees, Boston, this Tuesday,

30
00:03:03,096 --> 00:03:05,496
two company seats for your shirt.
You have five seconds to decide.

31
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:07,193
Five, four, three, two, one.

32
00:03:07,234 --> 00:03:08,723
- (laughing)
- I know...

33
00:03:08,768 --> 00:03:11,032
- Shh!
- Later.

34
00:03:16,276 --> 00:03:18,106
- (gasps)
- Uh-oh.

35
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:20,271
- (popping sound)
- (clears throat)

36
00:03:22,949 --> 00:03:25,918
(popping sound on numerous computers)

37
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:27,977
Uh, hello. Hello?

38
00:03:34,694 --> 00:03:36,593
Morning, boss. You have a
conference call in 30 minutes.

39
00:03:36,629 --> 00:03:38,598
Yes. About the marketing
of the spring books. I know.

40
00:03:38,632 --> 00:03:39,997
Staff meeting at 9:00.

41
00:03:40,033 --> 00:03:41,591
Did you call, um...
(groans) Wha's her name?

42
00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:44,069
The one with the ugly hands.

43
00:03:44,103 --> 00:03:45,127
- Janet.
- Yes, Janet.

44
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:46,569
Yes. I did call her. I told her that

45
00:03:46,605 --> 00:03:48,300
if she doesn't get her
manuscript in on time

46
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:50,740
you won't give her a release date.
Your immigration lawyer called.

47
00:03:50,776 --> 00:03:51,902
He said its imperative...

48
00:03:51,944 --> 00:03:53,605
Cancel the call, push
the meeting to tomorrow

49
00:03:53,646 --> 00:03:55,079
and keep the lawyer on the sheets.

50
00:03:55,115 --> 00:03:56,581
Oh, and get a hold of PR,

51
00:03:56,615 --> 00:03:58,049
have them start drafting
a press release.

52
00:03:58,084 --> 00:03:59,550
Frank is doing Oprah.

53
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:02,110
Wow. Nicely done.

54
00:04:02,155 --> 00:04:05,352
If I want your praise,
I will ask for it.

55
00:04:07,426 --> 00:04:09,360
Um...

56
00:04:09,396 --> 00:04:11,056
Who is, uh, who is Jillian?

57
00:04:11,097 --> 00:04:13,793
And why does she want me to call her?

58
00:04:17,002 --> 00:04:18,937
Well, that was originally my cup.

59
00:04:18,971 --> 00:04:20,939
And I'm drinking your coffee why?

60
00:04:20,973 --> 00:04:22,999
Because your coffee spilled.

61
00:04:28,682 --> 00:04:32,516
So, you drink unsweetened
cinnamon light soy lattes?

62
00:04:32,552 --> 00:04:35,612
I do. Its like Christmas in a cup.

63
00:04:35,654 --> 00:04:37,088
Is that a coincidence?

64
00:04:37,122 --> 00:04:39,523
- Incredibly, it is.
- (phone ringing)

65
00:04:39,558 --> 00:04:41,720
I mean I wouldn't possibly drink
the same coffee that you drink

66
00:04:41,761 --> 00:04:43,387
just in case yours spilled.

67
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:45,226
That would be pathetic.

68
00:04:45,264 --> 00:04:47,290
Morning. Miss Tate's office.

69
00:04:47,334 --> 00:04:48,630
Hey, Bob.

70
00:04:50,302 --> 00:04:53,533
Actually, we're headed to
your office right now. Yeah.

71
00:04:53,572 --> 00:04:56,336
Why are we headed to Bob's office?

72
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,867
- (tsks)
- (tsks)

73
00:04:58,911 --> 00:05:00,812
(tsks)

74
00:05:05,918 --> 00:05:07,750
- (popping sound)
- (multiple pops)

75
00:05:07,786 --> 00:05:08,845
(gasps) Oop!

76
00:05:12,257 --> 00:05:13,850
Have you finished the
manuscript I gave you?

77
00:05:13,893 --> 00:05:16,452
Uh, I read a few pages.
I wasn't that impressed.

78
00:05:16,495 --> 00:05:17,860
- Can I say something?
- No.

79
00:05:17,896 --> 00:05:19,956
I've read thousands of manuscripts,

80
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,399
and this is the only one
I've given you.

81
00:05:21,434 --> 00:05:23,163
There's an incredible novel in there.

82
00:05:23,202 --> 00:05:25,103
The kind of novel you used to publish.

83
00:05:25,137 --> 00:05:28,437
Uh, wrong. And I do think you
order the same coffee as I do

84
00:05:28,475 --> 00:05:30,966
just in case you spill,
which is, in fact, pathetic.

85
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:32,273
- Or impressive.
- I'd be impressed

86
00:05:32,312 --> 00:05:33,540
if you didn't spill in the first place.

87
00:05:33,579 --> 00:05:35,012
Now remember, you're
just a prop in here.

88
00:05:35,048 --> 00:05:37,016
- Won't say a word.
- (clears throat)

89
00:05:39,485 --> 00:05:44,423
Ah! Our fearless leader and
her liege. Please, do come in.

90
00:05:44,456 --> 00:05:48,086
Oh. Beautiful breakfront. Is it new?

91
00:05:48,127 --> 00:05:51,153
It is English Regency Egyptian
Revival, built in the 1800s

92
00:05:51,197 --> 00:05:54,029
but, yes, it is new to my office.

93
00:05:54,067 --> 00:05:55,694
Witty.

94
00:05:55,735 --> 00:05:58,362
Bob, I'm letting you go.

95
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:02,999
Pardon?

96
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:06,137
I asked you over a dozen times to get
Frank to do Oprah, and you didn't do it.

97
00:06:06,178 --> 00:06:08,271
You're fired.

98
00:06:10,149 --> 00:06:11,845
I have told you that is impossible.

99
00:06:11,884 --> 00:06:14,285
Frank hasn't done an
interview in 20 years.

100
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,014
(Tate) Well that is
interesting, because I just

101
00:06:16,055 --> 00:06:18,547
got off the phone
with him, and he is in.

102
00:06:19,826 --> 00:06:21,225
Excuse me?

103
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:22,660
You didn't even call him, did you?

104
00:06:24,064 --> 00:06:25,793
- But...
- I know, I know.

105
00:06:25,831 --> 00:06:29,062
Frank can be a little scary
to deal with. For you.

106
00:06:29,101 --> 00:06:32,332
Now, I will give you two
months to find another job.

107
00:06:32,372 --> 00:06:34,840
And then you can tell
everyone you resigned, OK?

108
00:06:38,911 --> 00:06:41,004
Whats his twenty?

109
00:06:41,047 --> 00:06:44,709
He's moving. He has crazy eyes.

110
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,843
Don't do it, Bob. Don't do it.

111
00:06:46,886 --> 00:06:50,879
- You poisonous bitch!
- (all gasp)

112
00:06:50,923 --> 00:06:52,584
You can't fire me!

113
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:54,923
You don't think I see
what you're doing here?

114
00:06:54,961 --> 00:06:56,723
Sandbagging me on this Oprah thing

115
00:06:56,762 --> 00:06:58,663
just so that you can
look good to the board?

116
00:06:58,697 --> 00:07:01,689
Because you are threatened by me!

117
00:07:01,735 --> 00:07:04,601
- And you are a monster.
- Bob, stop.

118
00:07:04,637 --> 00:07:07,935
Just because you have
no semblance of a life

119
00:07:07,973 --> 00:07:09,737
outside of this office,

120
00:07:09,776 --> 00:07:11,903
you think that you can treat all of us

121
00:07:11,944 --> 00:07:13,605
like your own personal slaves.

122
00:07:13,646 --> 00:07:16,206
You know what? I feel sorry for you.

123
00:07:16,249 --> 00:07:18,978
Because you know what you're
gonna have on your deathbed?

124
00:07:19,018 --> 00:07:21,043
Nothing and no one.

125
00:07:23,389 --> 00:07:25,856
(breathes deeply)

126
00:07:25,891 --> 00:07:27,449
Listen carefully, Bob.

127
00:07:27,494 --> 00:07:31,088
I didn't fire you because
I feel threatened. No.

128
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:34,531
I fired you because you're
lazy, entitled, incompetent

129
00:07:34,567 --> 00:07:36,228
and you spend more time
cheating on your wife

130
00:07:36,269 --> 00:07:37,600
than you do in your office.

131
00:07:37,637 --> 00:07:38,968
And if you say another word,

132
00:07:39,004 --> 00:07:41,302
Andrew here is gonna have you
thrown out on your ass, OK?

133
00:07:41,341 --> 00:07:43,865
Another word and you're
going out of here

134
00:07:43,909 --> 00:07:45,172
with an armed escort.

135
00:07:45,211 --> 00:07:47,076
Andrew will film it with
his little camera phone

136
00:07:47,112 --> 00:07:48,740
and he will put it
on that Internet site.

137
00:07:48,781 --> 00:07:50,009
- What was it?
- YouTube?

138
00:07:50,048 --> 00:07:52,483
Exactly. Is that what you want?

139
00:07:52,519 --> 00:07:54,146
Didn't think so. I have work to do.

140
00:07:54,187 --> 00:07:56,451
(all murmuring)

141
00:07:56,488 --> 00:07:58,514
Have security take his
breakfront out of his office

142
00:07:58,557 --> 00:07:59,683
and put it in my conference room.

143
00:07:59,725 --> 00:08:00,750
Will do.

144
00:08:00,793 --> 00:08:01,886
And I need you around this weekend

145
00:08:01,927 --> 00:08:03,293
to help review his files
and his manuscript.

146
00:08:03,329 --> 00:08:05,923
- This weekend?
- You have a problem with that?

147
00:08:05,964 --> 00:08:07,990
No. I... just my
grandmother's 90th birthday,

148
00:08:08,033 --> 00:08:09,432
so I was gonna go home and...

149
00:08:09,468 --> 00:08:11,266
...its fine. I'll cancel it.

150
00:08:11,303 --> 00:08:13,237
You're actually saving me from
a weekend of misery anyway,

151
00:08:13,273 --> 00:08:15,571
so its... good talk, yeah.

152
00:08:15,608 --> 00:08:20,704
I know, I know. OK, tell
Gammy I'm sorry. OK? What...

153
00:08:20,747 --> 00:08:22,305
Mom. What do you want me to tell you?

154
00:08:22,348 --> 00:08:24,781
She's making me work the weekend.

155
00:08:24,817 --> 00:08:26,115
No, I'm not... no.

156
00:08:26,151 --> 00:08:27,709
Listen, I've worked too
hard for this promotion

157
00:08:27,754 --> 00:08:28,846
to throw it all away, OK?

158
00:08:28,887 --> 00:08:30,377
I'm sure that Dad is pissed,

159
00:08:30,423 --> 00:08:33,323
but we take all of our submissions
around here very seriously.

160
00:08:33,359 --> 00:08:36,759
We'll get back to
you as soon as we can.

161
00:08:36,796 --> 00:08:38,787
- Was that your family?
- Yes.

162
00:08:38,831 --> 00:08:40,561
- They tell you to quit?
- Every single day.

163
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,797
Miss Tate's office.

164
00:08:43,836 --> 00:08:46,533
Oh... Yeah. OK. All right.

165
00:08:46,572 --> 00:08:48,665
Bergen and Malloy want to
see you upstairs immediately.

166
00:08:48,707 --> 00:08:51,302
(groans) OK. Come get me in ten
minutes. We've got a lot to do.

167
00:08:51,344 --> 00:08:52,368
Okey-doke.

168
00:08:53,846 --> 00:08:55,370
(phone ringing)

169
00:08:58,017 --> 00:08:59,711
Good morning, Miss Tate.

170
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:03,946
Jack, Edwin.

171
00:09:03,990 --> 00:09:05,753
Margaret, congratulations
on the Oprah thing.

172
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:07,657
- Thats terrific news.
- Thank you, thank you.

173
00:09:07,693 --> 00:09:10,561
This isn't about my second raise, is it?
(chuckles) Just kidding.

174
00:09:10,596 --> 00:09:14,225
Margaret, do you
remember when we agreed

175
00:09:14,267 --> 00:09:16,292
that you wouldn't go to
the Frankfurt Book Fair

176
00:09:16,336 --> 00:09:17,735
because you weren't allowed
out of the country

177
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:19,669
while your visa application
was being processed?

178
00:09:19,706 --> 00:09:20,730
Yes. I do.

179
00:09:20,773 --> 00:09:23,139
And... you went to Frankfurt.

180
00:09:23,176 --> 00:09:25,370
Yes, I did. We were going
to lose DeLillo to Viking.

181
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:27,436
So... really didn't
have a choice, did I?

182
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,845
It seems that the
United States Government

183
00:09:28,881 --> 00:09:30,907
doesn't care much who
publishes Don DeLillo.

184
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:33,713
We, uh, just spoke to
your immigration attorney.

185
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:36,380
Great. So, we're all good?
Everything good?

186
00:09:36,422 --> 00:09:38,889
Margaret, your visa application
has been denied.

187
00:09:38,924 --> 00:09:42,087
- (stammers)
- And you are being deported.

188
00:09:42,128 --> 00:09:43,254
Deported?

189
00:09:43,296 --> 00:09:44,990
And apparently there
was also some paperwork

190
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:46,395
that you didn't fill out in time.

191
00:09:46,432 --> 00:09:50,892
Come on. Come on! Its not
like I'm even an immigrant!

192
00:09:50,937 --> 00:09:52,927
I'm from Canada, for Chris's sake.

193
00:09:52,971 --> 00:09:55,337
There's gotta be... there's
gotta be something we can do.

194
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,342
We can reapply, but unfortunately

195
00:09:57,376 --> 00:10:00,369
you have to leave the country
for at least a year.

196
00:10:02,414 --> 00:10:07,317
OK. OK, well, thats
not ideal, but, uh...,

197
00:10:07,352 --> 00:10:09,149
I can, uh... I can manage
everything from Toronto...

198
00:10:09,187 --> 00:10:10,347
(Bergen) No, Margaret.

199
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:11,687
...with videoconferencing
and Internet.

200
00:10:11,724 --> 00:10:12,850
(Malloy) Unfortunately, Margaret,

201
00:10:12,892 --> 00:10:15,587
if you're deported,
you can't work for an American company.

202
00:10:15,628 --> 00:10:18,028
Until this is resolved I'm going
to turn operations over

203
00:10:18,063 --> 00:10:19,258
to Bob Spaulding.

204
00:10:19,298 --> 00:10:21,961
Bob Spaulding? The guy I just fired?

205
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,399
We need an editor in chief.

206
00:10:23,436 --> 00:10:25,802
He is the only person in the building
who has enough experience.

207
00:10:25,837 --> 00:10:27,668
- You cannot be serious. I beg of you.
- Margaret.

208
00:10:27,706 --> 00:10:29,674
We are desperate to have you stay.

209
00:10:29,708 --> 00:10:32,677
If there was any way, any way at all

210
00:10:32,711 --> 00:10:34,269
that we could make this work,
we'd be doing it.

211
00:10:34,313 --> 00:10:35,440
- (knocking)
- (Margaret) There is no way...

212
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,504
I am begging you.

213
00:10:36,548 --> 00:10:38,176
No, Margaret. Excuse me,
we're in a meeting.

214
00:10:38,216 --> 00:10:39,774
- Sorry to interrupt.
- What? What!

215
00:10:39,818 --> 00:10:42,379
Mary from Miss Winfrey's office
called. She's on the line.

216
00:10:42,422 --> 00:10:43,480
- I know.
- (Andrew) She's on hold.

217
00:10:43,523 --> 00:10:46,457
She needs to speak with you right away.
I told her you were otherwise engaged.

218
00:10:46,491 --> 00:10:49,052
She insisted, so... sorry.

219
00:10:49,095 --> 00:10:50,721
So...

220
00:11:00,706 --> 00:11:02,731
Uh... (mouthing)

221
00:11:03,909 --> 00:11:05,376
(whispering) Come here.

222
00:11:07,813 --> 00:11:11,580
Uh... Gentlemen, I understand.
I understand...

223
00:11:11,616 --> 00:11:14,711
the predicament that we are in.

224
00:11:14,754 --> 00:11:16,414
And, um...

225
00:11:17,756 --> 00:11:20,520
And there's, uh... well...

226
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:23,187
I think there's something
that you should know.

227
00:11:24,529 --> 00:11:27,931
Uh... we're, uh...
we're getting married.

228
00:11:27,966 --> 00:11:30,059
We are getting married.

229
00:11:30,102 --> 00:11:31,730
- Who is getting married?
- You and I.

230
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,534
You and I are getting married! Yes.

231
00:11:34,573 --> 00:11:36,235
- We are.
- Getting married.

232
00:11:36,274 --> 00:11:37,707
- (mumbling) We are getting married.
- Yes.

233
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:41,572
Isn't he your secretary?

234
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:42,672
Assistant.

235
00:11:42,715 --> 00:11:46,446
Executive, uh...
assistant secretary. Titles.

236
00:11:46,485 --> 00:11:50,751
But, wouldn't be the first time
one of us fell for our secretaries.

237
00:11:50,789 --> 00:11:52,780
Would it, Edwin?

238
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:55,054
(Margaret) With Laquisha. Remember?

239
00:11:55,094 --> 00:11:58,620
So, yeah... The truth is,

240
00:11:58,663 --> 00:12:02,793
you know, Andrew and I, we're...
we are just two people

241
00:12:02,835 --> 00:12:04,995
who weren't meant to
fall in love but we did.

242
00:12:05,038 --> 00:12:06,369
No.

243
00:12:06,405 --> 00:12:11,433
All those late nights at the
office and weekend book fairs.

244
00:12:11,476 --> 00:12:12,534
- Yeah...
- No.

245
00:12:12,577 --> 00:12:15,240
- Something happened.
- Something.

246
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:18,408
Yeah. Tried to fight it and...

247
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:20,077
Can't, can't fight a...

248
00:12:20,119 --> 00:12:24,578
Can't fight a love like ours, so, uh...

249
00:12:24,624 --> 00:12:28,024
Uh... Are we good with this?
Are you happy?

250
00:12:28,061 --> 00:12:31,928
Because, well... we are happy. So happy.

251
00:12:31,963 --> 00:12:33,090
- (Bergen) Margaret.
- Yes?

252
00:12:33,131 --> 00:12:35,032
Its terrific.

253
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:36,797
Just make it legal. Mmm?

254
00:12:36,836 --> 00:12:39,463
Oh! Legal. (chuckles)

255
00:12:39,504 --> 00:12:42,837
Yeah, well, then...
then that means we...

256
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:45,173
...we need to get ourselves
to the immigration office.

257
00:12:45,211 --> 00:12:47,838
So we can work this
whole mess out. Right?

258
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:49,745
(Margaret) Thank you
very much, gentlemen.

259
00:12:49,782 --> 00:12:50,840
We will do that right away.

260
00:12:50,883 --> 00:12:53,077
Thank you very much,
gentlemen. Thank you.

261
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:55,349
- Gentlemen.
- Thank you.

262
00:12:55,388 --> 00:12:58,015
(popping)

263
00:12:58,057 --> 00:13:00,024
(woman whispers) Margaret
and Andrew are getting married!

264
00:13:00,058 --> 00:13:01,355
(woman #2) What is that about?

265
00:13:01,394 --> 00:13:03,452
(man whispering) Dragon Lady!
Here they come...

266
00:13:03,495 --> 00:13:04,826
(snickering) Yeah.

267
00:13:04,864 --> 00:13:06,626
(woman #3) What is he thinking?

268
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:07,758
Mmm-mmm-mmm.

269
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:09,825
(indistinct chatter)

270
00:13:09,869 --> 00:13:12,462
Dude, for real. Her? (laughing)

271
00:13:12,504 --> 00:13:14,769
(woman #4) Married? Didn't
even know they were dating...

272
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,777
(Margaret clears throat)

273
00:13:34,025 --> 00:13:35,584
(clearing throat)

274
00:13:36,729 --> 00:13:37,753
What?

275
00:13:39,131 --> 00:13:41,032
I don't understand whats happening.

276
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:43,034
(Margaret) Relax. This is for you, too.

277
00:13:43,068 --> 00:13:44,399
Do explain.

278
00:13:44,437 --> 00:13:46,667
They were going to make Bob chief.

279
00:13:46,706 --> 00:13:48,366
So naturally I would have to marry you.

280
00:13:48,407 --> 00:13:49,999
(Margaret) And whats the problem?

281
00:13:50,042 --> 00:13:52,374
Like you were saving yourself
for someone special?

282
00:13:52,411 --> 00:13:55,538
I like to think so.
Besides, its illegal.

283
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:58,778
They're looking for terrorists,
not for book publishers.

284
00:13:58,817 --> 00:14:00,341
- Margaret.
- Yes?

285
00:14:00,385 --> 00:14:03,446
- I'm not gonna marry you.
- Sure you are.

286
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:06,514
Because if you don't marry me, your
dreams of touching the lives of millions

287
00:14:06,558 --> 00:14:08,288
with the written word are dead.

288
00:14:14,232 --> 00:14:16,758
Bob is gonna fire you the second
I'm gone. Guaranteed.

289
00:14:16,802 --> 00:14:18,860
That means you're out on the street
alone looking for a job.

290
00:14:18,904 --> 00:14:21,395
That means all the time that
we spent together, all the lattes,

291
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,634
all the canceled dates,
all the midnight Tampax runs,

292
00:14:23,676 --> 00:14:26,975
were all for nothing and all your dreams
of being an editor are gone.

293
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:29,413
But don't worry, after the required
allotment of time,

294
00:14:29,447 --> 00:14:30,914
we'll get a quickie divorce
and you'll be done with me.

295
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:32,780
But until then, like it or not,

296
00:14:32,817 --> 00:14:34,751
your wagon is hitched to mine. OK?

297
00:14:34,787 --> 00:14:36,981
- (phone ringing)
- Phone.

298
00:14:44,931 --> 00:14:47,057
(indistinct chatter)

299
00:14:51,236 --> 00:14:52,898
- This way.
- Margaret.

300
00:14:52,938 --> 00:14:54,963
- (hisses) Come.
- The line...

301
00:14:55,006 --> 00:14:56,030
Next, please.

302
00:14:56,075 --> 00:14:57,701
Ooh, ooh. Just, uh...

303
00:14:57,743 --> 00:14:59,267
Sorry, I just need to ask him something.

304
00:14:59,312 --> 00:15:02,110
I need for you to file this
fiancée visa for me, please.

305
00:15:03,548 --> 00:15:05,038
(scoffs)

306
00:15:06,751 --> 00:15:09,152
- Miss Tate?
- Yes.

307
00:15:09,187 --> 00:15:11,246
Please, come with me.

308
00:15:11,289 --> 00:15:13,850
(woman) Yes, ma'am, I understand
that. We're backed up...

309
00:15:15,027 --> 00:15:17,256
I have a bad feeling about this.

310
00:15:17,296 --> 00:15:18,320
(knocking)

311
00:15:20,932 --> 00:15:22,298
- Hi. Hello.
- Hello.

312
00:15:22,335 --> 00:15:24,826
Hi. I'm Mr. Gilbertson.

313
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,928
- Ah!
- And you must be Andrew,

314
00:15:26,972 --> 00:15:28,303
- and you must be...
- Margaret.

315
00:15:28,341 --> 00:15:30,138
...Margaret. Sorry about the wait.

316
00:15:30,176 --> 00:15:31,836
Its a, uh, crazy day today.

317
00:15:31,876 --> 00:15:34,038
Oh, of course, of course. We understand.

318
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,105
And I can't tell you how much
we appreciate you seeing us

319
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:40,209
- on such short notice.
- OK. (sighs)

320
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:42,744
* Buh, buh, buh, buh, buh
buh, buh, buh, buuuh

321
00:15:42,788 --> 00:15:44,619
So, I have one question for you.

322
00:15:44,657 --> 00:15:47,854
Are you both committing fraud
to avoid her deportation

323
00:15:47,893 --> 00:15:51,989
so she can keep her position
as editor in chief at Colden Books?

324
00:15:53,566 --> 00:15:55,658
- Thats ridiculous.
- Where did you hear that?

325
00:15:55,701 --> 00:15:57,999
We had a phone tip this afternoon
from a man named...

326
00:15:58,037 --> 00:15:59,799
Would it be Bob Spaulding?

327
00:15:59,838 --> 00:16:01,169
Bob Spaulding.

328
00:16:01,206 --> 00:16:04,505
Bob. Poor Bob. I am so sorry.

329
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:08,479
Bob is nothing but a disgruntled
former employee.

330
00:16:08,514 --> 00:16:09,605
And I apologize.

331
00:16:09,649 --> 00:16:12,345
But we know you're incredibly busy

332
00:16:12,384 --> 00:16:16,253
with a room full of gardeners
and delivery boys to tend to.

333
00:16:16,288 --> 00:16:17,846
If you just give us our next step,

334
00:16:17,889 --> 00:16:19,914
we will be out of your
hair and on our way.

335
00:16:21,027 --> 00:16:22,585
Miss Tate, please.

336
00:16:23,995 --> 00:16:28,125
Let me explain to you the
process thats about to unfold.

337
00:16:28,167 --> 00:16:31,567
Step one will be a scheduled interview.

338
00:16:31,604 --> 00:16:35,130
I'll put you each in a room,
and I'll ask you every little question

339
00:16:35,173 --> 00:16:37,142
that a real couple
would know about each other.

340
00:16:37,176 --> 00:16:41,374
Step two, I dig deeper.
I look at your phone records,

341
00:16:41,413 --> 00:16:43,745
I talk to your neighbors,
I interview your coworkers.

342
00:16:43,783 --> 00:16:46,216
If your answers don't match up
at every point,

343
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:48,913
you will be deported indefinitely.

344
00:16:48,953 --> 00:16:51,354
And you, young man,
will have committed a felony...

345
00:16:51,389 --> 00:16:55,383
- (woman shouting in Spanish)
...punishable by a fine of $250,000

346
00:16:55,427 --> 00:16:59,659
and a stay of five years
in federal prison.

347
00:17:02,768 --> 00:17:05,999
(Gilbertson) So, Andrew.

348
00:17:06,038 --> 00:17:09,439
You wanna... you want to talk to me?

349
00:17:13,278 --> 00:17:15,076
No?

350
00:17:17,615 --> 00:17:19,048
Yes?

351
00:17:23,154 --> 00:17:25,019
The truth is...

352
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:28,056
(Andrew clears throat)

353
00:17:28,094 --> 00:17:32,861
Mr. Gilbertson, the truth is...

354
00:17:32,897 --> 00:17:34,661
Margaret and I...

355
00:17:37,435 --> 00:17:39,403
...are just two people

356
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:42,430
who weren't supposed to fall in love.

357
00:17:43,308 --> 00:17:45,003
(Andrew) But did.

358
00:17:46,811 --> 00:17:49,041
We couldn't tell anyone we work with

359
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,674
because of my big promotion
that I had coming up.

360
00:17:51,717 --> 00:17:53,183
- (Gilbertson) Promotion?
- Yeah.

361
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:57,052
- Your...?
- We... we both felt, uh...

362
00:17:57,088 --> 00:18:01,219
...that it would be deeply inappropriate
if I were to be promoted to editor.

363
00:18:01,259 --> 00:18:03,922
- Editor. Mmm-hmm.
...while we were...

364
00:18:05,431 --> 00:18:07,990
So... (clears throat)

365
00:18:08,032 --> 00:18:11,093
Have the two of you told your parents
about your secret love?

366
00:18:11,136 --> 00:18:14,470
Oh, I... impossible.
My parents are dead.

367
00:18:14,507 --> 00:18:16,770
- No brothers or sisters either.
- Gone.

368
00:18:16,808 --> 00:18:19,106
Are your parents dead?

369
00:18:19,144 --> 00:18:21,306
- Oh, no, his are very much alive.
- No... very much.

370
00:18:21,346 --> 00:18:24,645
Very much. They're, ah... Well,
we were gonna tell them this weekend.

371
00:18:24,682 --> 00:18:28,642
Gammy's 90th birthday, and the whole
family's coming together.

372
00:18:28,686 --> 00:18:30,278
And we thought it'd be a nice surprise.

373
00:18:30,321 --> 00:18:32,346
(Gilbertson) And where is this
surprise gonna take place?

374
00:18:32,391 --> 00:18:34,483
At Andrew's parents' house.

375
00:18:34,527 --> 00:18:35,653
Where is that located again?

376
00:18:35,693 --> 00:18:38,322
Um... (scoffs)
Why am I doing all the talking?

377
00:18:38,364 --> 00:18:39,729
Its your parents' house.

378
00:18:39,765 --> 00:18:41,198
Why don't you tell him
where it is. Jump in.

379
00:18:42,634 --> 00:18:45,365
- Sitka.
- Sitka.

380
00:18:45,403 --> 00:18:47,429
- Alaska.
- Alaska?

381
00:18:47,472 --> 00:18:49,566
You're gonna go to Alaska this weekend?

382
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:53,077
- Yeah.
- Yes, yes.

383
00:18:53,112 --> 00:18:56,308
We are going to Alaska.
Alaska, thats where...

384
00:18:56,347 --> 00:18:59,249
Thats where my little...
thats where my Andrew's from.

385
00:19:00,786 --> 00:19:02,116
(Gilbertson) OK.

386
00:19:02,153 --> 00:19:05,612
Fine. I see how this is gonna go.

387
00:19:05,657 --> 00:19:08,593
I will see you both
at 11:00 Monday morning

388
00:19:08,626 --> 00:19:10,595
for your scheduled interview,

389
00:19:10,628 --> 00:19:14,029
and your answers better
match up on every account.

390
00:19:15,267 --> 00:19:16,632
- Thank you.
- Hello?

391
00:19:16,669 --> 00:19:18,761
- I'm looking forward to this one.
- We're looking forward to this one.

392
00:19:18,804 --> 00:19:19,862
Thank you.

393
00:19:19,904 --> 00:19:22,669
Gonna be fun.
I'll be checking up on you.

394
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:23,731
You got it.

395
00:19:28,847 --> 00:19:33,147
OK... so, whats gonna happen is
we will go up there.

396
00:19:33,184 --> 00:19:35,210
We will pretend like we're
boyfriend and girlfriend,

397
00:19:35,253 --> 00:19:36,846
tell your parents we're engaged.

398
00:19:36,888 --> 00:19:38,480
Uh, use the miles for the tickets.

399
00:19:38,523 --> 00:19:42,221
I guess I will pop for you to fly first
class. But make sure you use the miles.

400
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:43,592
If we don't get the miles,
we're not doing it.

401
00:19:43,628 --> 00:19:45,563
Oh, and please confirm
the vegan meal, OK?

402
00:19:45,597 --> 00:19:47,566
'Cause last time they actually
gave it to a vegan,

403
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:49,227
and they, uh... forced me to eat

404
00:19:49,268 --> 00:19:51,759
this clammy, warm, creamy
salad thing, which was...

405
00:19:51,804 --> 00:19:53,795
Hey, I'm... Why aren't you taking notes?

406
00:19:53,838 --> 00:19:56,171
I'm sorry, were you not in that room?

407
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,573
What? What?

408
00:19:58,943 --> 00:20:01,434
Oh! The thing you said about
being promoted?

409
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,471
Genius! Genius.
He completely fell for it.

410
00:20:03,516 --> 00:20:04,778
I was serious.

411
00:20:04,817 --> 00:20:07,718
I'm looking at a $250,000 fine
and five years in jail.

412
00:20:07,752 --> 00:20:08,946
That changes things.

413
00:20:08,988 --> 00:20:13,117
- Promote you to editor? No, no way.
- Then I quit, and you're screwed.

414
00:20:13,157 --> 00:20:14,182
Bye-bye, Margaret.

415
00:20:14,226 --> 00:20:15,692
- Andrew!
- It really has been

416
00:20:15,728 --> 00:20:19,128
- a little slice of heaven.
- Andrew, Andrew! Fine, fine.

417
00:20:20,465 --> 00:20:22,400
I'll make you editor. Fine.

418
00:20:22,433 --> 00:20:26,028
If you do the Alaska weekend
and the immigration interview,

419
00:20:26,070 --> 00:20:28,971
I will make you editor. Happy?

420
00:20:29,008 --> 00:20:31,407
- And not in two years. Right away.
- Fine.

421
00:20:31,442 --> 00:20:32,932
And you'll publish my manuscript.

422
00:20:34,779 --> 00:20:36,144
Ten thousand copy first...

423
00:20:36,181 --> 00:20:37,739
Twenty thousand copies, first run.

424
00:20:37,782 --> 00:20:39,717
And we'll tell my family
about our engagement

425
00:20:39,751 --> 00:20:41,378
when I want and how I want.

426
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,718
Now, ask me nicely.

427
00:20:43,756 --> 00:20:44,915
"Ask you nicely" what?

428
00:20:44,957 --> 00:20:48,722
Ask me nicely to marry you, Margaret.

429
00:20:50,762 --> 00:20:53,788
- What does that mean?
- You heard me. On your knee.

430
00:21:02,942 --> 00:21:03,965
Fine.

431
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:07,944
(honking)

432
00:21:12,384 --> 00:21:14,715
- Does this work for you?
- Oh, I like this. Yeah.

433
00:21:14,752 --> 00:21:16,913
- Will you marry me?
- No.

434
00:21:16,955 --> 00:21:18,513
Say it like you mean it.

435
00:21:18,557 --> 00:21:20,387
(clears throat)

436
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,527
- Andrew?
- Yes, Margaret?

437
00:21:24,563 --> 00:21:27,656
- Sweet Andrew?
- I'm listening.

438
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:30,692
Would you please,
with cherries on top, marry me?

439
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:35,967
OK. I don't appreciate the sarcasm,
but I'll do it.

440
00:21:36,008 --> 00:21:38,635
- See you at the airport tomorrow.
- Good.

441
00:21:51,557 --> 00:21:55,048
So, these are the questions
that INS is gonna ask us.

442
00:21:55,094 --> 00:21:58,086
Now, the good news is is
I know everything about you,

443
00:21:58,130 --> 00:21:59,825
but the bad news is
that you have four days

444
00:21:59,865 --> 00:22:04,665
to learn all this about me.
So, you should... probably get studying.

445
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,503
You know all the answers
to these questions about me?

446
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,567
- Scary, isn't it?
- (Margaret) A little bit.

447
00:22:12,611 --> 00:22:15,010
- What am I allergic to?
- Pine nuts.

448
00:22:15,047 --> 00:22:16,980
And the full spectrum of human emotion.

449
00:22:17,016 --> 00:22:18,983
Oh, thats... that was funny.
(chuckles)

450
00:22:19,018 --> 00:22:20,815
- Mmm-hmm.
- Umm...

451
00:22:20,853 --> 00:22:23,720
Here's a good one. Do I have any scars?

452
00:22:23,756 --> 00:22:25,655
I'm pretty sure that you have a tattoo.

453
00:22:25,691 --> 00:22:27,352
Oh, you're pretty sure?

454
00:22:27,393 --> 00:22:29,759
I'm pretty sure. Two years ago,
your dermatologist called

455
00:22:29,795 --> 00:22:31,729
and asked about a Q-switched laser.

456
00:22:31,763 --> 00:22:33,322
I of course Googled a Q-switched laser

457
00:22:33,365 --> 00:22:35,663
and found that they
in fact do remove tattoos.

458
00:22:35,701 --> 00:22:37,259
But you canceled your appointment.

459
00:22:38,836 --> 00:22:40,394
So what is it? Tribal ink?

460
00:22:40,439 --> 00:22:42,373
Japanese calligraphy? Barbed wire?

461
00:22:42,407 --> 00:22:45,240
You know, its exciting for me
to experience you like this.

462
00:22:45,277 --> 00:22:47,540
Thank you. You're gonna have
to tell me where it is, though.

463
00:22:47,578 --> 00:22:49,046
- No, I'm not.
- They're gonna ask.

464
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,605
We're done with that question.
We're done with that question.

465
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:53,845
On to another question.
Let me see, let me see.

466
00:22:53,885 --> 00:22:56,752
Oh, here's one. Whose place do we
stay at, yours or mine?

467
00:22:56,788 --> 00:22:58,188
Thats easy. Mine.

468
00:22:58,222 --> 00:23:00,087
And why wouldn't we stay at mine?

469
00:23:00,125 --> 00:23:02,615
Because I live at Central Park West.

470
00:23:02,661 --> 00:23:05,596
And you probably live at some
squalid little studio apartment

471
00:23:05,631 --> 00:23:08,599
with stacks of yellowed
Penguin Classics.

472
00:23:08,634 --> 00:23:11,603
(woman on PA) Ladies and gentlemen,
please fasten your seat belts.

473
00:23:11,636 --> 00:23:14,230
We are beginning our descent
into Juneau.

474
00:23:14,272 --> 00:23:16,001
Juneau? I thought
we were going to Sitka.

475
00:23:17,276 --> 00:23:21,303
- We are.
- How are we getting to Sitka?

476
00:23:21,346 --> 00:23:23,439
- (rumbling)
- (rattling)

477
00:23:25,384 --> 00:23:26,476
Whoa.

478
00:23:50,476 --> 00:23:53,740
All right. Here we go.

479
00:23:56,181 --> 00:23:58,115
- Oh, there he is!
- Andrew!

480
00:23:58,150 --> 00:24:01,346
- (woman shouting)
- (laughter)

481
00:24:04,990 --> 00:24:06,651
Hi. Right this way...

482
00:24:10,229 --> 00:24:12,026
- Hi!
- Oh...

483
00:24:12,064 --> 00:24:14,657
- Its so good to see you!
- You're suffocating him, Grace.

484
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:16,599
- Come here.
- Hey, Gammy.

485
00:24:16,634 --> 00:24:19,398
Ah, Gammy. How are you doing?
Where's Dad?

486
00:24:19,438 --> 00:24:22,134
Oh, you know your father.
He's always working.

487
00:24:22,173 --> 00:24:24,539
Never mind about him. Where's your girl?

488
00:24:24,576 --> 00:24:27,044
Uh, she's... right there.

489
00:24:27,078 --> 00:24:28,671
- (Gammy) Ah.
- (Andrew) There she is.

490
00:24:28,713 --> 00:24:31,682
I guess the word "girl"
is inappropriate.

491
00:24:31,717 --> 00:24:33,048
Annie.

492
00:24:34,153 --> 00:24:35,176
- Hi!
- (Margaret) Hello.

493
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,982
- Margaret, this is my mom.
- Oh, hello.

494
00:24:37,021 --> 00:24:39,455
Yeah, great. This is my gammy, Annie.

495
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:42,585
- Pleasure.
- Well, hello there.

496
00:24:42,627 --> 00:24:47,622
Now, do you prefer being called Margaret
or Satan's Mistress?

497
00:24:47,665 --> 00:24:49,530
We've heard it both ways.

498
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:51,365
(Gammy) Actually we've heard it
lots of ways.

499
00:24:51,403 --> 00:24:52,994
She's kidding.

500
00:24:53,038 --> 00:24:55,506
- Oh! Oh... OK.
- (chuckling)

501
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,008
Thank you so much for...

502
00:24:57,041 --> 00:24:58,737
allowing me to be a part
of this weekend.

503
00:24:58,777 --> 00:25:01,973
Oh, you're welcome.
We're thrilled to have you.

504
00:25:02,013 --> 00:25:03,742
Lets get you two back to the fort.

505
00:25:03,781 --> 00:25:05,909
- OK.
- (Gammy) Oh...

506
00:25:05,951 --> 00:25:08,977
- Its so good to see you.
- (grunts) There we are.

507
00:25:42,855 --> 00:25:44,116
(Margaret whispers) Andrew...

508
00:25:44,155 --> 00:25:47,614
(slightly louder) Andrew. Andrew!

509
00:25:49,493 --> 00:25:52,087
(yelps) Please, don't do that.

510
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:55,292
You didn't tell me about all
the family businesses, honey.

511
00:25:55,334 --> 00:25:58,530
He was probably just
being modest, dear.

512
00:25:58,569 --> 00:26:00,059
Oh.

513
00:26:07,511 --> 00:26:10,640
What are we doing? Shouldn't we
check into our hotel right now?

514
00:26:10,682 --> 00:26:13,082
Oh, we canceled your reservation.

515
00:26:13,117 --> 00:26:14,550
Family doesn't stay at a hotel.

516
00:26:14,586 --> 00:26:16,280
You're gonna stay in our home.

517
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,311
Oh, great! Great.

518
00:26:18,356 --> 00:26:19,756
- What?
- (grunts) God.

519
00:26:19,790 --> 00:26:21,986
You're gonna wanna use your legs
to lift that one.

520
00:26:22,027 --> 00:26:24,859
Andrew! Help her with those.

521
00:26:24,896 --> 00:26:27,387
I'd love to, but she won't let me
do anything.

522
00:26:27,432 --> 00:26:30,923
She insists on doing it all herself.
She's one of those... she's a feminist.

523
00:26:35,374 --> 00:26:37,000
(grunts)

524
00:26:40,144 --> 00:26:41,373
Come on, sweetie.

525
00:26:42,847 --> 00:26:45,442
(Gammy) You see the shoes
that broad was wearing?

526
00:26:54,992 --> 00:26:56,118
This is the last of 'em.

527
00:26:57,695 --> 00:26:58,958
- Oh!
- Ooh.

528
00:26:58,997 --> 00:27:02,160
- (Andrew) Five second rule.
- Got it!

529
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,531
That will dry right off.

530
00:27:04,568 --> 00:27:06,798
Psst! Psst!
I'm not getting on that boat.

531
00:27:06,837 --> 00:27:08,702
You don't have to.
See you in a few days.

532
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:10,970
Psst! You know I can't swim.

533
00:27:11,009 --> 00:27:13,500
Hence, the boat.

534
00:27:20,484 --> 00:27:21,884
Come on.

535
00:27:26,391 --> 00:27:28,358
(Andrew) Come on. Here we go.

536
00:27:35,099 --> 00:27:38,330
Looking good, boss.
Take your time, though.

537
00:27:38,369 --> 00:27:40,429
Shh.

538
00:27:45,143 --> 00:27:47,337
She comes with a lot of baggage.

539
00:27:47,378 --> 00:27:48,710
Just gonna give you
a little hand here.

540
00:27:50,682 --> 00:27:53,616
Hand off ass! Off ass!

541
00:27:56,188 --> 00:27:59,281
There you go. You're there.

542
00:28:03,561 --> 00:28:07,588
Congratulations.
I'm a hundred years old now.

543
00:28:07,632 --> 00:28:09,930
(boat engine starting)

544
00:28:33,959 --> 00:28:36,086
(Grace) Here we are. We're home.

545
00:28:38,430 --> 00:28:40,489
That is your home?

546
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:43,926
Who are you people?

547
00:28:58,282 --> 00:28:59,807
(Margaret) Why did you tell me
you were poor?

548
00:28:59,851 --> 00:29:02,683
- (Andrew) I never said I was poor.
- But you never told me you were rich.

549
00:29:02,721 --> 00:29:04,915
I'm not rich. My parents are rich.

550
00:29:04,955 --> 00:29:07,390
OK, you know what?
Thats something only rich people say.

551
00:29:07,425 --> 00:29:08,950
(woman) Hey, Andrew! Welcome home!

552
00:29:08,993 --> 00:29:11,723
Hi! Mom, what is this?

553
00:29:11,762 --> 00:29:14,391
Nothing. Its just a little
welcoming party.

554
00:29:14,432 --> 00:29:15,661
Is that a crime?

555
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,826
Just 50 of our closest
friends and neighbors.

556
00:29:17,868 --> 00:29:19,529
And all excited to meet you.

557
00:29:19,570 --> 00:29:21,903
- Oh, good. Good.
- Come on. Come on.

558
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:24,238
- A party?
- Yeah, I guess so.

559
00:29:24,276 --> 00:29:26,903
Come on. Lets go. My grandma's
moving faster than you.

560
00:29:28,512 --> 00:29:29,912
Put your back into it.

561
00:29:32,616 --> 00:29:33,913
(* Michael Bublé:
I've Got You Under My Skin)

562
00:29:33,951 --> 00:29:35,509
- (indistinct chatter)
- (laughter)

563
00:29:35,554 --> 00:29:37,749
(woman) So nice to meet you,
Margaret. Welcome to Sitka.

564
00:29:37,788 --> 00:29:39,779
Jill? Hi. Nice to meet you.
My pleasure.

565
00:29:39,825 --> 00:29:42,988
Why didn't you tell me you were
some kind of Alaskan Kennedy?

566
00:29:43,028 --> 00:29:44,086
How could I?

567
00:29:44,128 --> 00:29:47,621
We were in the middle of talking about
you for the last three years.

568
00:29:47,665 --> 00:29:49,361
OK, know what? Timeout, OK?

569
00:29:49,401 --> 00:29:51,130
This bickering Bickerson thing
has got to stop.

570
00:29:51,169 --> 00:29:53,160
People need to think that we are
in love. So lets just...

571
00:29:53,204 --> 00:29:54,729
That, thats no problem.
I can do that.

572
00:29:54,772 --> 00:29:57,640
I can pretend to be the doting fiancé.
Thats easy.

573
00:29:57,675 --> 00:29:59,143
But for you, its going to require

574
00:29:59,176 --> 00:30:01,576
that you stop snacking on
children while they dream.

575
00:30:01,613 --> 00:30:04,308
Very funny. When are you going
to tell them we're engaged?

576
00:30:04,348 --> 00:30:05,713
I'll pick the right moment.

577
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:09,617
Hey, Andrew. Hi!

578
00:30:09,653 --> 00:30:12,281
Mrs. McKittrick. How are you?
Nice to see you.

579
00:30:12,324 --> 00:30:14,315
Nice to see you, Mr. McKittrick.
This is Margaret.

580
00:30:14,358 --> 00:30:16,223
- Hi. Pleasure.
- Margaret!

581
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:17,660
Hi, how are you? Pleasure.

582
00:30:17,695 --> 00:30:21,096
So I always wanted to know,
what does a book editor do?

583
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:23,226
(man) Thats a great question, Louise.

584
00:30:23,268 --> 00:30:25,667
I'm curious to know the answer myself.

585
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:28,500
- Hello, Dad.
- Son.

586
00:30:29,307 --> 00:30:30,830
This must be Maggie.

587
00:30:30,875 --> 00:30:32,502
Uh, Margaret.

588
00:30:32,544 --> 00:30:36,001
- Joe. Pleasure to meet you.
- Pleasure's mine.

589
00:30:36,047 --> 00:30:39,642
So why don't you tell us exactly
what a book editor does.

590
00:30:39,683 --> 00:30:43,142
Besides taking writers out
to lunch and getting bombed.

591
00:30:43,188 --> 00:30:45,554
(Louise) Now that sounds like fun.

592
00:30:45,589 --> 00:30:47,386
No wonder you like being an editor.

593
00:30:47,424 --> 00:30:50,655
No, Louise. Andrew's not an editor,
he's an editor's assistant.

594
00:30:50,694 --> 00:30:53,185
Maggie here is the editor.

595
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,788
Margaret.

596
00:30:54,833 --> 00:30:58,325
- So you're actually...
- Andrew's boss. Yeah.

597
00:30:58,369 --> 00:30:59,997
Well. How about that.

598
00:31:00,038 --> 00:31:01,403
(Louise) Huh.

599
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:03,430
I think I'll get a refill.

600
00:31:05,609 --> 00:31:06,974
Charming.

601
00:31:10,781 --> 00:31:13,842
Thats a hell of
a first impression, Dad.

602
00:31:13,884 --> 00:31:15,943
What the hell, Andrew?

603
00:31:15,987 --> 00:31:18,750
You show up here after all this
time with this woman you hated

604
00:31:18,789 --> 00:31:20,121
- and now she's your girlfriend?
- We just got here.

605
00:31:20,157 --> 00:31:21,454
Can we wait two seconds

606
00:31:21,492 --> 00:31:22,925
before we throw the
kitchen sink at each other?

607
00:31:22,961 --> 00:31:26,192
Just never figured you for a guy
who slept his way to the middle.

608
00:31:26,230 --> 00:31:27,925
Actually, I'll have you know
that that woman in there

609
00:31:27,965 --> 00:31:29,593
is one of the most
respected editors in town.

610
00:31:29,634 --> 00:31:30,726
She's your meal ticket,

611
00:31:30,769 --> 00:31:32,236
and you brought her home
to meet your mother.

612
00:31:32,269 --> 00:31:36,638
She's not my meal ticket, Dad.
She's my fiancée.

613
00:31:36,674 --> 00:31:39,234
- What'd you say?
- You heard me.

614
00:31:39,277 --> 00:31:41,074
I'm getting married.

615
00:31:44,648 --> 00:31:46,548
- How are you?
- Good, good. Thank you.

616
00:31:46,585 --> 00:31:47,915
Would you care for
some hors ďoeuvres?

617
00:31:47,952 --> 00:31:49,250
No, I'm fine. Thank you very much.

618
00:31:49,287 --> 00:31:50,617
Its a tradition.

619
00:31:50,654 --> 00:31:52,316
Its the texture. I'm not a fish person.

620
00:31:52,356 --> 00:31:54,757
- You'll like it.
- You're very sweet.

621
00:31:54,792 --> 00:31:57,386
I think if you'll just taste it.

622
00:31:57,429 --> 00:31:58,827
(muffled) Thank you so much.

623
00:32:02,666 --> 00:32:03,792
(Andrew) Ladies and gentlemen...

624
00:32:03,835 --> 00:32:06,326
I have a very important
announcement to make.

625
00:32:06,371 --> 00:32:07,962
Margaret and I are getting married.

626
00:32:08,006 --> 00:32:09,268
Its the paprika.

627
00:32:09,307 --> 00:32:10,672
So sorry.

628
00:32:10,709 --> 00:32:13,507
Thats OK. Its wash-and-wear.

629
00:32:15,346 --> 00:32:18,338
(Andrew) Yep. Honey? Where you at?

630
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,847
Here it is.

631
00:32:23,821 --> 00:32:25,517
Come on down here, pumpkin.

632
00:32:25,557 --> 00:32:27,354
- (Andrew) All right.
- OK.

633
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:29,951
Oh, look at her. Look at her.

634
00:32:29,994 --> 00:32:31,154
(clapping)

635
00:32:31,195 --> 00:32:33,630
Right there, ladies and
gentlemen. There she is.

636
00:32:33,664 --> 00:32:36,098
(woman) Congratulations, Andrew.

637
00:32:36,134 --> 00:32:37,157
Thank you.

638
00:32:37,201 --> 00:32:39,067
Thank you very much.

639
00:32:39,104 --> 00:32:41,663
- (woman) Time to celebrate.
- (woman #2) Get the champagne.

640
00:32:44,643 --> 00:32:46,269
So that was your idea
of the perfect time

641
00:32:46,310 --> 00:32:47,505
- to tell them we're engaged?
- Mmm.

642
00:32:47,545 --> 00:32:49,205
'Cause it was brilliant.
Brilliant timing.

643
00:32:49,247 --> 00:32:51,214
Andrew. Hi.

644
00:32:51,249 --> 00:32:55,184
Gert? Oh, my God. Hey, hi. Wow.

645
00:32:55,220 --> 00:32:57,653
How you doing? I didn't know
that you were gonna be here.

646
00:32:57,689 --> 00:33:00,953
Your mom probably wanted it to
be a surprise. So... surprise.

647
00:33:00,991 --> 00:33:03,482
- Right.
- And...

648
00:33:03,528 --> 00:33:06,462
...we're being completely rude. Hi.

649
00:33:06,498 --> 00:33:09,694
- (Andrew) Oh, God. This is my ex...
- Hi. I'm Gertrude.

650
00:33:09,733 --> 00:33:12,167
- Oh! Oh, wow. Wow!
- You can call me Gert.

651
00:33:12,202 --> 00:33:14,397
Well, congratulations, you guys.

652
00:33:14,439 --> 00:33:15,872
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

653
00:33:15,906 --> 00:33:17,431
So did I miss the story?

654
00:33:18,242 --> 00:33:19,403
- What story?
- What story?

655
00:33:19,443 --> 00:33:21,207
About how you proposed.

656
00:33:21,246 --> 00:33:25,579
Oh! How a man proposes says
a lot about his character.

657
00:33:25,616 --> 00:33:27,675
- Yes.
- Yes, it does.

658
00:33:27,719 --> 00:33:30,346
I actually would love
to hear the story, Andrew.

659
00:33:30,387 --> 00:33:31,513
Would you tell us?

660
00:33:31,556 --> 00:33:33,887
- (man) Yeah.
- (crowd murmurs) Yeah.

661
00:33:33,924 --> 00:33:35,789
- (giggling)
- (Andrew) You know what?

662
00:33:35,826 --> 00:33:39,819
Actually, Margaret loves
telling this story...

663
00:33:39,864 --> 00:33:42,423
so I'm just gonna let her
go ahead and do that.

664
00:33:42,467 --> 00:33:44,662
'Cause I think we
should just sit in rapture.

665
00:33:44,702 --> 00:33:48,001
Huh! Wow, OK.

666
00:33:48,038 --> 00:33:51,873
Wow, where to begin... this story.

667
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:54,902
Well... um, wow.

668
00:33:54,945 --> 00:33:57,005
Mmm... yeah.

669
00:33:57,048 --> 00:34:01,916
OK, well, um, Andrew and I...

670
00:34:01,952 --> 00:34:04,717
Andrew and I were about to celebrate

671
00:34:04,756 --> 00:34:07,349
- our first anniversary together.
- (all) Aw...

672
00:34:07,392 --> 00:34:10,224
And I knew that he'd been
itching to ask me to marry him.

673
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:13,458
And he was scared.
Like a little tiny bird.

674
00:34:13,498 --> 00:34:15,898
So I started leaving him
little hints here and there...

675
00:34:15,934 --> 00:34:18,697
...because I knew he wouldn't
have the guts to ask, but...

676
00:34:18,737 --> 00:34:21,570
Thats not exactly how it happened.

677
00:34:21,606 --> 00:34:23,096
- No? Hmm.
- No. No.

678
00:34:23,141 --> 00:34:25,701
I mean, I picked up on
all her little hints.

679
00:34:25,744 --> 00:34:27,768
This woman's about as subtle as a gun.

680
00:34:27,811 --> 00:34:30,041
- (all laugh)
- (Andrew) Yeah.

681
00:34:30,081 --> 00:34:31,411
What I was worried about was

682
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:33,313
that she might find this little box...

683
00:34:33,351 --> 00:34:36,376
Oh! The decoupage box that he made

684
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:38,581
where he'd taken the time to cut out

685
00:34:38,623 --> 00:34:41,387
tiny, little pictures of himself. Yes.

686
00:34:41,425 --> 00:34:45,123
Just pasted all over the
box. Oh! So beautiful.

687
00:34:45,163 --> 00:34:47,597
So I opened that beautiful,
little decoupage

688
00:34:47,632 --> 00:34:51,500
and out fluttered these tiny,
little hand-cut heart confettis.

689
00:34:51,536 --> 00:34:55,632
And once they cleared,
I looked down, and I saw...

690
00:34:55,672 --> 00:34:58,335
...the most beautiful, big...

691
00:34:58,376 --> 00:34:59,900
...fat nothing.

692
00:34:59,943 --> 00:35:01,309
No ring.

693
00:35:01,346 --> 00:35:02,938
- No ring?
- What?

694
00:35:02,981 --> 00:35:05,972
No. But inside that box...

695
00:35:06,016 --> 00:35:07,677
...underneath all that crap...

696
00:35:07,719 --> 00:35:09,983
...there was a little
handwritten note...

697
00:35:10,021 --> 00:35:13,547
with the address to
a hotel, date, and time.

698
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,286
Real Humphrey Bogart-type stuff.

699
00:35:15,326 --> 00:35:16,690
(man) Yeah.

700
00:35:16,728 --> 00:35:18,559
- Masculine.
- (grunts)

701
00:35:18,596 --> 00:35:20,460
Anyway, naturally, Margaret thought...

702
00:35:20,498 --> 00:35:22,056
I thought he was seeing someone else.

703
00:35:22,099 --> 00:35:24,226
- (crowd murmurs)
- It was a terrible time for me,

704
00:35:24,268 --> 00:35:26,635
but I went to that hotel anyway.

705
00:35:26,670 --> 00:35:28,764
I went there and I pounded on the door,

706
00:35:28,806 --> 00:35:30,637
but the door was already unlocked.

707
00:35:30,675 --> 00:35:34,543
And as swung open that
door, there he was...

708
00:35:34,579 --> 00:35:36,103
- Standing.
- Kneeling.

709
00:35:36,146 --> 00:35:37,704
- Like a man.
- On a bed of rose petals,

710
00:35:37,748 --> 00:35:41,206
in a tuxedo. Your son. Your son.

711
00:35:41,251 --> 00:35:44,813
And he was choking back
soft, soft sobs.

712
00:35:44,856 --> 00:35:48,121
And when he held back the tears
and finally caught his breath,

713
00:35:48,159 --> 00:35:49,217
he said to me...

714
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:50,318
"Margaret, will you marry me?"

715
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:53,693
And she said, "Yep."
The end. Who's hungry?

716
00:35:54,865 --> 00:35:56,025
(crowd cooing)

717
00:35:56,067 --> 00:35:58,728
That is quite a story.

718
00:35:58,769 --> 00:36:00,670
- (Gammy) Oh, Andy!
- Gorgeous.

719
00:36:00,704 --> 00:36:03,139
You are so sensitive.

720
00:36:03,942 --> 00:36:06,934
Hand-cut confetti? (laughs)

721
00:36:06,978 --> 00:36:09,811
Hey! Lets see a kiss
from you two cuties.

722
00:36:09,847 --> 00:36:10,940
(man) Give her a kiss!

723
00:36:10,981 --> 00:36:13,041
- No. Come on.
- Oh, yeah.

724
00:36:13,083 --> 00:36:14,108
- Come on!
- (all cheering)

725
00:36:14,152 --> 00:36:15,710
OK, all right.

726
00:36:15,753 --> 00:36:17,617
OK. Here we go. Ready?

727
00:36:19,257 --> 00:36:23,523
What is this? Kiss her on
the mouth like you mean it.

728
00:36:23,561 --> 00:36:27,155
- Kiss her. Kiss her!
- (all chanting) Kiss her!

729
00:36:27,197 --> 00:36:31,099
Kiss her! Kiss her!
Kiss her! Kiss her!

730
00:36:31,135 --> 00:36:32,762
OK!

731
00:36:33,938 --> 00:36:34,996
- OK. All right.
- OK.

732
00:36:35,039 --> 00:36:37,199
- Here we go.
- Mmm-hmm. OK.

733
00:36:38,909 --> 00:36:40,706
- Oh!
- (chuckles)

734
00:36:40,744 --> 00:36:43,373
Andy! Give her a real kiss!

735
00:36:43,414 --> 00:36:46,076
- (chuckling) Gammy.
- A real one!

736
00:36:46,117 --> 00:36:47,641
- (woman) Yeah.
- (woman #2) You can do it!

737
00:36:47,684 --> 00:36:49,346
Why don't we just do it?
Lets just do it really fast.

738
00:36:50,355 --> 00:36:52,949
- (both) Mmmm.
- (cheering)

739
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:55,925
- Mmm.
- Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

740
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,121
- (muffled) OK.
- Mmm.

741
00:37:06,838 --> 00:37:07,963
Hmm.

742
00:37:09,706 --> 00:37:11,971
I'm so happy for you two!

743
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:15,376
So happy! So happy!

744
00:37:15,413 --> 00:37:17,277
(woman) Lets get the champagne!

745
00:37:18,215 --> 00:37:20,150
So here we are.

746
00:37:21,985 --> 00:37:23,715
This is your bedroom.

747
00:37:24,956 --> 00:37:30,916
Wow. Wow, this is, um...
beautiful. And the view.

748
00:37:30,961 --> 00:37:32,759
And here's the bed.

749
00:37:32,797 --> 00:37:35,594
Wow! Exquisite bed. Exquisite.

750
00:37:35,632 --> 00:37:38,601
So... where is Andrew's room?

751
00:37:38,635 --> 00:37:40,570
Oh, sweetie, we're not
under any illusions

752
00:37:40,605 --> 00:37:43,472
that you two don't
sleep in the same bed.

753
00:37:43,507 --> 00:37:45,771
(laughing) He'll sleep
in here with you.

754
00:37:45,809 --> 00:37:48,175
Oh, great, 'cause we love to snuggle.

755
00:37:48,211 --> 00:37:50,146
- Don't we, honey.
- We're huge snugglers.

756
00:37:50,181 --> 00:37:52,411
- (barking)
- Oh, my God. What is it?

757
00:37:52,449 --> 00:37:56,351
- Calm down, Kevin.
- Whoa! You are cute.

758
00:37:56,387 --> 00:37:57,978
Who is this?

759
00:37:58,021 --> 00:38:01,617
- Thats Kevin. I'm sorry, Margaret.
- So cute.

760
00:38:01,659 --> 00:38:03,717
We just rescued him from the pound,

761
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,751
and he's still in training. Sorry.

762
00:38:05,797 --> 00:38:07,764
Just be sure you don't
let him outside,

763
00:38:07,798 --> 00:38:09,596
or the eagles will snatch him.

764
00:38:09,634 --> 00:38:11,498
No, don't you listen to her.

765
00:38:11,536 --> 00:38:13,333
She's just pulling
your leg, isn't she?

766
00:38:13,371 --> 00:38:16,704
By the way, there are extra
towels and linens and things

767
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,798
in here if you need them.

768
00:38:17,842 --> 00:38:19,672
(Gammy) And if you
get chilly tonight...

769
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:21,371
...use this.

770
00:38:21,411 --> 00:38:23,141
It has special powers.

771
00:38:23,181 --> 00:38:26,172
Oh, what kind of special powers?

772
00:38:26,217 --> 00:38:27,844
I call it the Baby Maker.

773
00:38:27,885 --> 00:38:29,978
OK, well. Then I guess we...

774
00:38:30,021 --> 00:38:31,545
...gonna be super careful with that one.

775
00:38:31,588 --> 00:38:33,715
- Yeah, I'm just gonna...
- Don't throw it on the bed.

776
00:38:33,757 --> 00:38:35,726
We'd better turn in.
Its been quite an evening.

777
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:37,489
So good night, everybody.

778
00:38:37,527 --> 00:38:38,824
- Good night.
- Good night.

779
00:38:38,862 --> 00:38:41,855
- Good night.
- Good night, Gammy.

780
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,061
- (chuckling) Good night.
- (Margaret) Good night.

781
00:38:47,739 --> 00:38:49,797
- (Gammy) Good night.
- Good night, Gammy.

782
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,273
Thank you so much. Sweet dreams.

783
00:38:51,309 --> 00:38:53,003
- Bye-bye, now.
- Bye.

784
00:38:56,179 --> 00:38:59,114
(Margaret) So, uh... you haven't
been home in a while.

785
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:02,449
I haven't had a lot of vacation
time the last three years.

786
00:39:02,487 --> 00:39:04,681
Stop complaining.

787
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:10,219
Um... Don't look, OK?

788
00:39:11,094 --> 00:39:12,356
OK.

789
00:39:13,597 --> 00:39:14,826
Are your eyes closed?

790
00:39:14,865 --> 00:39:16,163
Completely.

791
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:19,567
- Are you sure?
- Yes, I'm sure.

792
00:39:28,211 --> 00:39:31,909
Those are the pajamas you
decided to bring to Alaska.

793
00:39:31,949 --> 00:39:35,407
Yes, because I was supposed
to be in a hotel alone.

794
00:39:35,452 --> 00:39:38,445
- Remember?
- Can we just go to sleep?

795
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:40,547
- Fine.
- Great.

796
00:39:48,632 --> 00:39:50,965
(exhales, clears throat)

797
00:40:10,253 --> 00:40:12,449
Well. (clears throat)

798
00:40:12,489 --> 00:40:13,751
Looks like I won't be
getting much sleep

799
00:40:13,791 --> 00:40:16,315
with the sun streaming in.

800
00:40:22,699 --> 00:40:24,190
Thank you.

801
00:40:39,349 --> 00:40:41,215
(phone ringing)

802
00:40:45,456 --> 00:40:47,356
(Margaret) Andrew. Phone.

803
00:40:47,891 --> 00:40:50,860
Andrew!

804
00:40:50,894 --> 00:40:53,295
Crap. Andrew, Andrew, phone.

805
00:40:53,331 --> 00:40:54,695
Andrew!

806
00:40:54,731 --> 00:40:56,666
Yeah... right.

807
00:41:00,304 --> 00:41:03,831
- Andrew, where is it?
- Purse, side pocket.

808
00:41:05,108 --> 00:41:07,407
- (thumping)
- (grunting)

809
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:12,443
Hello. Hello? Hello.

810
00:41:12,483 --> 00:41:14,347
Frank! Frank, darling.

811
00:41:14,385 --> 00:41:15,443
Darling, Frank.

812
00:41:15,485 --> 00:41:17,784
Are you there? Hello? Hello? Oh, crap.

813
00:41:17,822 --> 00:41:21,280
I have horrible service, Frank.
Give me just one minute.

814
00:41:21,324 --> 00:41:23,088
Oh, my God! Margaret!

815
00:41:23,126 --> 00:41:25,686
(whispering) One... one minute.
Frank, hold on just a second.

816
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:26,753
Frank, hold on. No, no, no, no.

817
00:41:26,797 --> 00:41:27,889
(door shuts)

818
00:41:27,931 --> 00:41:30,661
Frank. Frank, I'm sorry you feel

819
00:41:30,701 --> 00:41:33,362
I pressured you into doing Oprah, but...

820
00:41:33,403 --> 00:41:36,862
Of course I want you
to be happy. Yes, yes.

821
00:41:36,907 --> 00:41:42,744
Frank. Frank. Frank, darling.
Frank? Its going to be fine.

822
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,907
I can just call them and I can cancel.

823
00:41:46,317 --> 00:41:47,875
(panting)

824
00:41:49,554 --> 00:41:52,021
(Margaret) You are...
you are so right, Frank.

825
00:41:52,056 --> 00:41:54,182
Yes, Frank, of course
I'm listening to you.

826
00:41:54,224 --> 00:41:55,885
Yeah... yes.

827
00:41:55,927 --> 00:41:57,518
I love listening to you, Frank.

828
00:41:57,561 --> 00:42:01,123
- (yapping)
- Shh! Sit. Sit.

829
00:42:02,465 --> 00:42:03,592
No, not you, Frank.

830
00:42:03,634 --> 00:42:05,431
- No, no.
- (barking)

831
00:42:05,469 --> 00:42:07,197
Frank, if I may get down to it, OK...

832
00:42:07,237 --> 00:42:10,764
I think it would be
a mistake to back out.

833
00:42:10,807 --> 00:42:14,005
- Because, Frank, for so many years...
- (eagle screeching)

834
00:42:14,045 --> 00:42:17,503
...you have inspired me with your
beautiful words, and I feel that...

835
00:42:17,547 --> 00:42:19,175
Shh! Dog, I'm on the phone.

836
00:42:19,217 --> 00:42:22,117
I think its time that the world
get to enjoy your words as well.

837
00:42:22,152 --> 00:42:23,677
They are just so rich

838
00:42:23,721 --> 00:42:24,847
- with... passion...
- (dog barking)

839
00:42:24,889 --> 00:42:29,552
And I think that we
should all be privy to.

840
00:42:29,594 --> 00:42:31,289
- Frank, I just, uh...
- (screeching)

841
00:42:31,329 --> 00:42:32,920
I just, uh, want you
to be happy, Frank.

842
00:42:32,963 --> 00:42:35,454
Give me that dog!

843
00:42:35,498 --> 00:42:37,932
Frank, hold on a second.
Can you hold a second?

844
00:42:37,969 --> 00:42:38,992
Give me that dog!

845
00:42:40,704 --> 00:42:42,228
Come on! Come on, come on, come on.

846
00:42:42,273 --> 00:42:44,536
- Come on! Come on! Oh, oh...
- (squeaking)

847
00:42:44,574 --> 00:42:47,099
Oh, oh! Oh, oh. OK! OK, gotcha.

848
00:42:47,143 --> 00:42:48,974
Frank, Frank.

849
00:42:49,012 --> 00:42:50,206
Frank? So sorry, so sorry.

850
00:42:50,248 --> 00:42:53,376
So sorry. I dropped the phone.
Now, listen, Frank.

851
00:42:53,416 --> 00:42:56,146
I don't want to sell you on anything,

852
00:42:56,186 --> 00:42:57,983
but this is your legacy, this book.

853
00:42:58,021 --> 00:42:59,420
And I think its up to you to

854
00:42:59,456 --> 00:43:00,481
present your legacy to the world.

855
00:43:00,523 --> 00:43:03,721
And call me tomorrow with your decision.

856
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:05,489
And my phone is on
all the time! OK, bye-bye.

857
00:43:05,528 --> 00:43:06,552
No! Wait!

858
00:43:07,297 --> 00:43:09,960
No! No! N-n-n... no. No

859
00:43:10,001 --> 00:43:11,525
Take the doggy. Look at the doggy.

860
00:43:11,568 --> 00:43:13,469
I need that phone. Take the dog.

861
00:43:13,503 --> 00:43:14,971
Take the dog. I need that phone!

862
00:43:15,005 --> 00:43:18,304
Here. Take the dog.
Take the dog. Take it. Take it.

863
00:43:18,342 --> 00:43:20,333
(Grace) Look at this.

864
00:43:20,378 --> 00:43:21,572
(both laughing)

865
00:43:21,612 --> 00:43:24,342
- Is that cute or what?
- I know.

866
00:43:26,349 --> 00:43:29,079
Morning, guys. Have you seen... daah.

867
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:32,248
She's playing with Kevin.
We thought she didn't like him.

868
00:43:32,289 --> 00:43:33,313
Will you go get her, Andy?

869
00:43:33,356 --> 00:43:35,324
We have a whole day planned for her,

870
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:37,293
and she needs to get ready.

871
00:43:37,327 --> 00:43:39,592
Yeah. Tell her we have
a big surprise for her.

872
00:43:39,630 --> 00:43:41,257
Mmm.

873
00:43:43,833 --> 00:43:46,802
Look! Give me my phone. Come on.
Please, just give me my phone.

874
00:43:46,836 --> 00:43:49,465
- Come on. Right here.
- What the hell are you doing?

875
00:43:49,507 --> 00:43:52,498
Oh, my God. Your grandmother
was completely right.

876
00:43:52,543 --> 00:43:54,340
The eagle came
and tried to take the dog.

877
00:43:54,378 --> 00:43:57,835
But then I saved him. Then it
came back, and it took my phone.

878
00:43:57,882 --> 00:44:00,248
- Are you drunk?
- What? No! I'm serious.

879
00:44:00,284 --> 00:44:02,751
He's got my phone, and Frank's
calling me on that phone.

880
00:44:02,786 --> 00:44:04,117
Relax, all right?

881
00:44:04,155 --> 00:44:07,215
We'll order another phone, same number.
We'll go into town tomorrow and get it.

882
00:44:07,257 --> 00:44:08,315
- Really?
- Yeah.

883
00:44:08,358 --> 00:44:13,489
- Oh, OK. All right. Well, you go then.
- (barking)

884
00:44:13,530 --> 00:44:15,362
- You have to get ready.
- For what?

885
00:44:15,398 --> 00:44:16,831
You're going out with Mom and the girls.

886
00:44:16,867 --> 00:44:19,528
- I don't want to go out.
- Shopping, sightseeing. And a surprise.

887
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:21,036
- I hate shopping.
- You'll love it.

888
00:44:21,072 --> 00:44:22,539
- I hate sightseeing.
- You're going.

889
00:44:22,572 --> 00:44:23,835
- No, I don't want to go.
- You're going.

890
00:44:23,873 --> 00:44:25,501
- I'm not going. I'm not going.
- Yes, you are.

891
00:44:25,543 --> 00:44:27,010
Now give me a nice big hug.
We don't want them

892
00:44:27,043 --> 00:44:28,170
- to think we're fighting.
- I don't want to touch you.

893
00:44:28,211 --> 00:44:30,009
- Come on. Hug time.
- No, I don't want to...

894
00:44:30,047 --> 00:44:31,775
- Hug time.
- I don't want to...

895
00:44:31,815 --> 00:44:33,579
There we go.

896
00:44:33,617 --> 00:44:36,313
Yeah, thats nice.

897
00:44:36,353 --> 00:44:39,050
Yeah. Thats nice.

898
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:41,650
There we go. Isn't that nice?

899
00:44:41,692 --> 00:44:43,215
- Mmm-hmm.
- (Andrew) Mmm-hmm.

900
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:44,726
- (Margaret) Mmm. Yeah.
- (Andrew) Boop boop boop.

901
00:44:44,762 --> 00:44:47,025
If you touch my ass one more time,

902
00:44:47,063 --> 00:44:49,224
I will cut your balls
off in your sleep. OK?

903
00:44:49,266 --> 00:44:51,097
- Yeah.
- There you go.

904
00:44:51,135 --> 00:44:53,797
All righty now. So, uh...
We clear on that?

905
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:56,204
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Such a good fiancé.

906
00:44:56,239 --> 00:44:58,036
Hmm. Ow.

907
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:07,677
(splashing)

908
00:45:11,489 --> 00:45:14,719
- (Joe) Jeez.
- You want to see me?

909
00:45:14,759 --> 00:45:17,454
Your mom found these eco-balls.

910
00:45:17,494 --> 00:45:19,360
They dissolve in water.

911
00:45:19,396 --> 00:45:20,954
(grunts)

912
00:45:20,998 --> 00:45:23,728
I don't know how she
comes up with this stuff.

913
00:45:23,768 --> 00:45:27,726
Anyway, she, uh... is a little peeved.

914
00:45:27,771 --> 00:45:31,764
Apparently, I wasn't the most
gracious of hosts last night.

915
00:45:31,809 --> 00:45:33,106
It was a little bit of a shock

916
00:45:33,143 --> 00:45:34,702
to find out that
you're getting married...

917
00:45:34,744 --> 00:45:37,976
...especially when none of us
even knew you were dating.

918
00:45:38,014 --> 00:45:42,815
The point is... I owe you an apology.

919
00:45:44,454 --> 00:45:46,615
Accepted.

920
00:45:46,657 --> 00:45:49,387
There's something else.

921
00:45:49,427 --> 00:45:53,260
I've been going over my
retirement plans recently,

922
00:45:53,297 --> 00:45:54,820
and it got me thinking.

923
00:45:56,534 --> 00:45:58,057
I've done a lot of things in my life.

924
00:45:58,101 --> 00:46:01,798
Practically built an empire with
your mother from the ground up.

925
00:46:01,838 --> 00:46:02,998
It doesn't mean anything unless...

926
00:46:03,039 --> 00:46:04,438
Unless you have someone to leave it to.

927
00:46:04,474 --> 00:46:07,911
- We already discussed this.
- I'd like to discuss it again.

928
00:46:07,945 --> 00:46:11,880
You have responsibilities here.

929
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:13,679
I think I've been
more than understanding

930
00:46:13,717 --> 00:46:15,115
about your goofing off in New York.

931
00:46:15,152 --> 00:46:16,813
I need you to quit playing around...

932
00:46:16,853 --> 00:46:17,911
Here we go again.

933
00:46:17,954 --> 00:46:20,253
When are you going to start
taking what I do seriously?

934
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:22,155
When you start acting seriously.

935
00:46:22,193 --> 00:46:24,661
I'm sorry.

936
00:46:24,695 --> 00:46:26,663
I feel sorry for you, Dad.

937
00:46:26,697 --> 00:46:29,222
I wish you had another son. I really do.

938
00:46:29,266 --> 00:46:30,425
One who wanted to stay here.

939
00:46:30,467 --> 00:46:32,231
One who wanted to take over
the family business.

940
00:46:32,268 --> 00:46:34,327
One who wanted to marry someone
that you approve of,

941
00:46:34,371 --> 00:46:37,704
but its not me. Now,
it must seem strange to you,

942
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:42,677
my life in New York... sitting
in an office, reading books.

943
00:46:42,713 --> 00:46:45,306
But it makes me happy. You understand?

944
00:46:48,485 --> 00:46:51,943
If thats what makes you happy,
son, I got nothing to say.

945
00:46:51,989 --> 00:46:54,014
Well, thats a first.

946
00:46:54,057 --> 00:46:58,757
You know what? Apology not
accepted. Have fun out here.

947
00:47:02,532 --> 00:47:03,556

948
00:47:11,641 --> 00:47:13,041
(indistinct chatter)

949
00:47:13,077 --> 00:47:14,567
(Grace) There is no way you
could leave her at home.

950
00:47:14,612 --> 00:47:16,375
She had to be here. Absolutely.

951
00:47:16,413 --> 00:47:18,438
She's been coming here forever.

952
00:47:18,481 --> 00:47:21,246
I hope you are ready
for your big surprise...

953
00:47:21,284 --> 00:47:24,583
...because this is one of
Sitka's greatest treasures.

954
00:47:24,621 --> 00:47:26,885
- Right?
- Oh, yes. Oh, yeah.

- Wow.
- Over here, Ramone! Over here.

she's gonna be missing.

Come, my sexy princess.

970
00:48:35,092 --> 00:48:36,786
- Yeah!
- (Margaret) Oh, no. Not necessary.

971
00:48:36,827 --> 00:48:39,693
Its a really nice gesture,
but I really need to just...

972
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:40,958
(Gammy) Go on, Margaret. Get up there!

973
00:48:40,998 --> 00:48:42,056
You come dance.

974
00:48:42,099 --> 00:48:43,588

For you. For you. For you.

- (Gert) Yeah!
- (Ramone) Enjoy!

987
00:49:33,182 --> 00:49:38,085
I don't want to touch it.
No. OK, OK. Very sweet.

988

No, no, no, no, no.

989

How are you holding up?

Oh, fine. Fine. Just working on my tan.

Yeah, the Paxtons can be
a bit overwhelming at times.

Yes, yes.

1001
00:50:31,275 --> 00:50:33,402
Its a little different
than New York, huh?

1002
00:50:33,443 --> 00:50:36,902
Little bit. Little bit. You ever been?

1003
00:50:36,947 --> 00:50:39,938
No. That was always
Andrew's dream, not mine.

1004
00:50:39,983 --> 00:50:42,349
You guys were pretty serious, huh?

1005
00:50:42,385 --> 00:50:45,115
Well, I mean, we dated in high
school and all through college,

1006
00:50:45,155 --> 00:50:47,248
but we were kids.

1007
00:50:49,059 --> 00:50:51,550
And you guys called it off because of...

1008
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:55,961
Well, um...

1009
00:50:55,998 --> 00:51:00,663
the night before we graduated
school, he proposed...

1010
00:51:00,704 --> 00:51:02,228
...and said he wanted to elope

1011
00:51:02,271 --> 00:51:05,036
and run away to New York with me.

1012
00:51:05,074 --> 00:51:07,635
And...

1013
00:51:07,677 --> 00:51:09,543
You said "no."

1014
00:51:09,579 --> 00:51:12,514
And I said "no," yeah.

1015
00:51:12,548 --> 00:51:16,485
I've never been anywhere
but here. This is home.

1016
00:51:16,519 --> 00:51:21,320
But anyway... you're a lucky girl.

1017
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:26,590
He really is the best, which
you obviously already know.

Oh, yep. Yep, very much so, yeah.

00:51:56,293 --> 00:52:00,490
- (Gammy giggling)
- He was wonderful.

1028
00:52:00,998 --> 00:52:02,260
Oh, no.

1029
00:52:04,601 --> 00:52:07,536
(* Living Colour: Cult of
Personality through headphones)

1030
00:52:07,570 --> 00:52:09,902
(Grace shouting) Andrew!

1031
00:52:09,940 --> 00:52:12,204
Andrew, honey, is everything OK?

1032
00:52:15,711 --> 00:52:17,543
What... Whats he doing?

1033
00:52:17,581 --> 00:52:20,048
Something's up. Its best
to leave him alone.

1034
00:52:20,083 --> 00:52:21,344
Come on, honey.

1035
00:52:25,456 --> 00:52:27,481
(man on TV)... Hunts version
of that here tonight.

1036
00:52:27,523 --> 00:52:30,219
Hey, hey, hey. What are you
doing? I'm watching that.

1037
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:31,590
Why is Andrew out there

1038
00:52:31,628 --> 00:52:34,027
hollowing out that old
stupid canoe again?

1039
00:52:34,063 --> 00:52:36,498
(Joe) Well, maybe he's
planning to escape. What?

1040
00:52:36,532 --> 00:52:38,329
I am so tired.

1041
00:52:38,367 --> 00:52:40,199
Think I'm gonna go
upstairs, take a shower,

1042
00:52:40,237 --> 00:52:42,431
wash off Ramone's coconut body oil.

1043
00:52:42,472 --> 00:52:43,838
Sure.

1044
00:52:43,873 --> 00:52:46,206
I had a great day today. Thank you.

1045
00:52:48,478 --> 00:52:49,503
What did you do?

1046
00:52:49,545 --> 00:52:51,775
I didn't do anything, I mean...

1047
00:52:51,815 --> 00:52:55,773
I just had a frank conversation
with him about his future.

1048
00:52:55,818 --> 00:52:58,447
(Grace) Oh... Well, yeah.
Thats a good idea.

1049
00:52:58,489 --> 00:52:59,956
Thats a good idea, Joe,

1050
00:52:59,989 --> 00:53:02,219
because he will never
come back home now.

1051
00:53:02,259 --> 00:53:05,853
He is my son. I only get
to see him every three years

1052
00:53:05,896 --> 00:53:08,329
because of you. Because of you.

1053
00:53:08,364 --> 00:53:09,422
- (barking)
- (Grace) I've had enough.

1054
00:53:09,465 --> 00:53:11,934
- You are gonna be supportive...
- Shh!

1055
00:53:11,969 --> 00:53:13,094
...of him marrying
Margaret, and that is that.

1056
00:53:13,135 --> 00:53:15,934
- Shh! Shh! Shh!
- (barking continues)

1057
00:53:15,972 --> 00:53:17,530
You know, if we're not careful,

1058
00:53:17,574 --> 00:53:20,474
we are gonna end up in
this great big house...

1059
00:53:20,510 --> 00:53:22,637
...just you and me alone...

1060
00:53:22,679 --> 00:53:24,407
...you and me and everything
that we're angry about,

1061
00:53:24,447 --> 00:53:27,746
and God forbid that they
should have a grandchild

1062
00:53:27,784 --> 00:53:29,478
that we never get to see.

1063
00:53:29,519 --> 00:53:33,581
You are going to fix this,
Joe. I mean it. Fix it now.

1064
00:53:34,525 --> 00:53:36,516
(clears throat)

1065
00:53:38,161 --> 00:53:39,355
(Margaret singing Relax)

1066
00:53:42,965 --> 00:53:46,163
(groans) Where's a towel?

1067
00:53:48,472 --> 00:53:51,168
(music playing through headphones)

1068
00:53:51,842 --> 00:53:53,331
Towel...

1069
00:53:55,344 --> 00:53:58,507
Towel, towel, towel... towel, towel.

1070
00:53:58,548 --> 00:54:00,380
This is all they have for a towel?

1071
00:54:00,416 --> 00:54:02,907
Its ridiculous. I can't get dry.

1072
00:54:02,952 --> 00:54:05,079
(music on headphones continues)

1073
00:54:05,922 --> 00:54:06,981
Hello.

1074
00:54:08,692 --> 00:54:09,784
Hello?

1075
00:54:15,666 --> 00:54:16,996
Oh!

1076
00:54:19,268 --> 00:54:20,793
- (barking)
- Oh! Oh. Oh, oh, oh.

1077
00:54:20,836 --> 00:54:21,860
No, no, no, no, no.

1078
00:54:21,905 --> 00:54:23,668
J-j-just... I'm sorry.

1079
00:54:23,706 --> 00:54:25,867
L-l-let me just,
let me just get a towel.

1080
00:54:25,909 --> 00:54:27,342
Let me just get a towel.

1081
00:54:27,376 --> 00:54:29,311
(moans) Just... look.

1082
00:54:29,346 --> 00:54:31,007
You need to just... I'm sorry.

1083
00:54:31,047 --> 00:54:32,538
OK, I'm sorry for
feeding you to the eagle.

1084
00:54:32,583 --> 00:54:34,050
- (barking)
- I'm sorry.

1085
00:54:34,083 --> 00:54:38,646
(barking continues)

1086
00:54:38,688 --> 00:54:39,849
Go away. Go away.

1087
00:54:39,889 --> 00:54:42,153
Go, go. Just let me get a towel.

1088
00:54:42,192 --> 00:54:45,251
Go, go, go... Hold on.

1089
00:54:48,264 --> 00:54:51,563
(hair dryer blowing)

1090
00:54:51,601 --> 00:54:53,297
Yeah. Huh?

1091
00:54:53,336 --> 00:54:56,362
- (whimpering, barking)
- How you like that? Huh?

1092
00:54:56,405 --> 00:54:58,340
Take it, take it. Thats right.

1093
00:54:58,375 --> 00:55:01,003
Thats what I'm talking
about. You like that?

1094
00:55:03,112 --> 00:55:05,842
Oh. You like it.

1095
00:55:05,882 --> 00:55:07,907
(music continues)

1096
00:55:10,786 --> 00:55:13,755
- Come here. Come to Mama.
- (barking)

1097
00:55:13,789 --> 00:55:15,849
Thats right. Get on the carpet.

1098
00:55:15,891 --> 00:55:17,882
Thats a good boy.

1099
00:55:17,927 --> 00:55:22,193
Yes! Thats good, boy! Come on.

1100
00:55:22,231 --> 00:55:23,893
Come on!

1101
00:55:23,934 --> 00:55:25,458
- Oh, oh!
- (barking)

1102
00:55:27,471 --> 00:55:28,994
(both gasp)

1103
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:32,530
- Oh, oh!
- What the...?

1104
00:55:32,576 --> 00:55:35,101
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

1105
00:55:35,144 --> 00:55:37,545
- Why are you naked? My God!
- Oh, God. Why are you wet?

1106
00:55:37,581 --> 00:55:40,175
- Don't look at me.
- I don't understand.

1107
00:55:40,217 --> 00:55:41,706
- (Andrew) Why are you wet?
- Why are you naked?

1108
00:55:41,751 --> 00:55:43,413
Don't look at me.

1109
00:55:43,452 --> 00:55:46,047
Oh, God! You're showing everything.

1110
00:55:46,088 --> 00:55:48,079
Cover it up, for the love of God!

1111
00:55:48,125 --> 00:55:52,391
(gasping) Oh, God, not the Baby Maker.

1112
00:55:52,429 --> 00:55:53,952
Explain yourself please.

1113
00:55:53,996 --> 00:55:56,226
- Explain myself?
- Yes, explain yourself.

1114
00:55:56,266 --> 00:55:57,425
- I was outside.
- Oh, really?

1115
00:55:57,467 --> 00:55:59,731
- You didn't hear me?
- I was listening to...

1116
00:55:59,769 --> 00:56:00,963
What are you even doing home?

1117
00:56:01,003 --> 00:56:03,130
Then you just, jump me
out of nowhere? Whats that?

1118
00:56:03,172 --> 00:56:04,902
I di... I didn't mean to jump you.

1119
00:56:04,940 --> 00:56:09,240
Your dog was attacking me, and I
had to run, and I ran into you.

1120
00:56:09,278 --> 00:56:10,905
What is it with you and this dog?

1121
00:56:10,947 --> 00:56:12,938
Just, you know, just... go.

1122
00:56:12,983 --> 00:56:14,280
- Go...
- Fine.

1123
00:56:14,317 --> 00:56:15,909
- Go take a shower. You stink.
- Fine.

1124
00:56:15,952 --> 00:56:17,782
- Nice tattoo, by the way.
- What?

1125
00:56:18,621 --> 00:56:19,884
(barking)

1126
00:56:19,922 --> 00:56:22,322
See? See? Exactly. You see that?

1127
00:56:22,358 --> 00:56:24,952
Oh... barely made it out
with my life there.

1128
00:56:24,994 --> 00:56:26,929
See the size of the teeth on that thing?

1129
00:56:26,963 --> 00:56:28,362
I didn't...

1130
00:56:29,766 --> 00:56:31,027
(groans)

1131
00:56:37,106 --> 00:56:38,130
(Margaret clears throat)

1132
00:56:42,478 --> 00:56:48,076
So... (exhales) So naked.

1133
00:56:48,117 --> 00:56:49,585
(clears throat)

1134
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:52,018
Can we, uh, not talk about that, please?

1135
00:56:53,190 --> 00:56:54,713
Just sayin'.

1136
00:56:59,596 --> 00:57:02,155
So, uh, whats the deal
with you and your father?

1137
00:57:02,199 --> 00:57:06,829
Ooh, I'm sorry. That question
is not in the binder. (clicks)

1138
00:57:06,869 --> 00:57:09,235
Oh, really? Well, I thought
you were the one that said

1139
00:57:09,271 --> 00:57:10,603
we needed to learn all this...

1140
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:12,197
Not about that, I didn't.

1141
00:57:12,242 --> 00:57:14,141
- But if the guy asks us...
- Not about that, Margaret.

1142
00:57:14,177 --> 00:57:16,007
Good night.

1143
00:57:27,523 --> 00:57:30,981
(sighs, clears throat)

1144
00:57:31,027 --> 00:57:35,429
- (Margaret) I like the Psychic Network.
- What?

1145
00:57:35,465 --> 00:57:38,228
Not in the "ha-ha, isn't that
funny, she likes that trash"

1146
00:57:38,268 --> 00:57:41,327
kind of way. I actually quite enjoy it.

1147
00:57:41,371 --> 00:57:42,929
Umm...

1148
00:57:46,076 --> 00:57:49,010
I took disco lessons in the sixth grade.

1149
00:57:51,181 --> 00:57:55,208
My first concert was
Rob Base & D.J. E-Z Rock.

1150
00:57:57,454 --> 00:57:59,717
I think Brian Dennehy is sexy.

1151
00:58:01,157 --> 00:58:02,454
Don't like flowers in the house,

1152
00:58:02,492 --> 00:58:05,791
'cause they remind me of funerals.

1153
00:58:05,829 --> 00:58:07,353
Never played a video game.

1154
00:58:08,465 --> 00:58:11,400
I read Wuthering Heights
every Christmas.

1155
00:58:11,434 --> 00:58:13,800
Its my favorite book.

1156
00:58:16,606 --> 00:58:21,065
Haven't slept with a man
in over a year and a half.

1157
00:58:23,045 --> 00:58:25,639
And, uh... I went to
the bathroom and cried

1158
00:58:25,681 --> 00:58:28,708
after Bob called me a poisonous bitch.

1159
00:58:30,320 --> 00:58:33,186
And the, uh, bird tattoo?

1160
00:58:33,222 --> 00:58:34,621
They're swallows.

1161
00:58:37,193 --> 00:58:41,255
Got them when I was 16...
after my parents died.

1162
00:58:43,699 --> 00:58:46,726
Stupid. (clears throat)

1163
00:58:46,769 --> 00:58:48,862
I'm sure there's many many other things,

1164
00:58:48,905 --> 00:58:51,373
but thats all I can
come up with right now.

1165
00:58:58,514 --> 00:58:59,981
You, uh, there? (chuckles)

1166
00:59:02,985 --> 00:59:04,248
I'm here.

1167
00:59:06,922 --> 00:59:08,686
Just processing.

1168
00:59:15,398 --> 00:59:17,695
You really haven't slept
with anyone in 18 months?

1169
00:59:17,733 --> 00:59:20,224
Oh, my God. Out of all that,
thats all you got?

1170
00:59:20,269 --> 00:59:21,737
Thats a long time.

1171
00:59:21,771 --> 00:59:24,068
Yeah, well, I've been a little busy.

1172
00:59:24,106 --> 00:59:26,233
Yeah...

1173
00:59:28,777 --> 00:59:30,677
Who's, uh...

1174
00:59:30,713 --> 00:59:33,842
- Rob Base and D. J...
- E-Z Rock?

1175
00:59:33,884 --> 00:59:35,646
- Yeah.
- You know.

1176
00:59:35,684 --> 00:59:37,050
(singing It Takes Two)

1177
00:59:42,492 --> 00:59:44,356
- No. They were good.
- Mm-mm.

1178
00:59:46,795 --> 00:59:48,023
(chuckles)

1179
00:59:48,063 --> 00:59:52,193
- What?
- Nothing.

1180
00:59:52,235 --> 00:59:55,762
I know who they are. I just
wanted to hear you sing it.

1181
00:59:55,804 --> 00:59:58,068
(Andrew laughing)

1182
01:00:00,076 --> 01:00:01,134
(sighs)

1183
01:00:03,914 --> 01:00:06,780
- Margaret?
- Yes?

1184
01:00:08,652 --> 01:00:11,119
Don't take this the wrong way.

1185
01:00:12,755 --> 01:00:15,519
(clears throat) 'K.

1186
01:00:15,557 --> 01:00:20,585
You are a very... very beautiful woman.

1187
01:00:38,213 --> 01:00:40,204
(laughing)

1188
01:00:46,121 --> 01:00:48,090
- Feel it deep, feel it low.
- Mmm-hmm.

1189
01:00:49,793 --> 01:00:52,489
God, I can't sing that high.

1190
01:00:53,429 --> 01:00:55,260
(both laughing)

1191
01:01:08,210 --> 01:01:10,509
(birds chirping)

1192
01:01:16,152 --> 01:01:17,778
Huh? Where am I?

1193
01:01:19,655 --> 01:01:21,021
What time is it?

1194
01:01:21,056 --> 01:01:22,614
- What time is it?
- (blinds sliding)

1195
01:01:22,659 --> 01:01:26,288
Ooh! Ooh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh...

1196
01:01:39,442 --> 01:01:40,568
Oh, God.

1197
01:02:01,498 --> 01:02:02,760
(knocking)

1198
01:02:02,798 --> 01:02:06,599
(Grace) Room service.
Breakfast for the happy couple.

1199
01:02:06,635 --> 01:02:09,161
- (whispers) Andrew! Andrew!
- (groaning)

1200
01:02:09,204 --> 01:02:12,139
- Andr...
- (grunts)

1201
01:02:12,175 --> 01:02:13,641
Your mother's at the door. Get up!

1202
01:02:13,675 --> 01:02:15,041
- Get up here! Your mother's...
- Oh, God.

1203
01:02:15,077 --> 01:02:16,670
(Margaret shouts) Just a second!

1204
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:23,349
- Not the baby blanket.
- OK, all right.

1205
01:02:23,385 --> 01:02:26,115
Not the baby blanket. Get it
off, get it off, get it off.

1206
01:02:26,155 --> 01:02:28,090
- OK, all right.
- Wait a second. Hold on.

1207
01:02:28,123 --> 01:02:30,092
- What? What?
- Are you wearing makeup?

1208
01:02:30,126 --> 01:02:31,855
What? No. Of course not.

1209
01:02:31,894 --> 01:02:34,954
- OK, what do we do? All right.
- Just spoon me, spoon me...

1210
01:02:34,998 --> 01:02:37,762
- Oh, my God! What is that?
- I'm sorry. Its morning.

1211
01:02:37,800 --> 01:02:39,768
What do you mean, "Its morning"?

1212
01:02:39,802 --> 01:02:41,463
(Grace) Are you OK?

1213
01:02:41,503 --> 01:02:44,336
Yep! Coming. One second. Yep.
Come on in. Everything's fine.

1214
01:02:44,373 --> 01:02:46,864
(whispers) Disgusting.

1215
01:02:46,909 --> 01:02:48,706
Ow, you're on my hair. OK, just...

1216
01:02:48,744 --> 01:02:53,943
(both panting)

1217
01:02:53,983 --> 01:02:57,282
- (Margaret) Oh, wow.
- (Andrew) Ooh, smells good.

1218
01:02:57,320 --> 01:02:58,719
Cinnamon rolls.

1219
01:02:58,755 --> 01:03:00,847
Oh, you shouldn't have
gone to that trouble.

1220
01:03:00,889 --> 01:03:03,858
Oh, you're family now. Its no trouble.

1221
01:03:03,893 --> 01:03:06,293
Hey, you have room for one more?

1222
01:03:06,329 --> 01:03:10,458
Wow. Could we not do the
Brady family meeting right now?

1223
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:11,523
We just got up...

1224
01:03:11,568 --> 01:03:12,967
- Yeah.
...if you don't mind.

1225
01:03:13,001 --> 01:03:15,061
Your mother and I have
come up with a proposition

1226
01:03:15,105 --> 01:03:18,302
and I happen to think
its a terrific idea...

1227
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:20,605
We want you
to get married here tomorrow.

1228
01:03:20,643 --> 01:03:21,768
Tomorrow.

1229
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:25,806
- What? What? What?
- Mmm-mmm. No.

1230
01:03:25,849 --> 01:03:27,510
Well, you're gonna get married anyway,

1231
01:03:27,550 --> 01:03:29,949
so why don't you get married here...

1232
01:03:29,985 --> 01:03:31,385
...where we can be all together,

1233
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:34,719
and that way Grandma Annie
can be a part of it.

1234
01:03:34,757 --> 01:03:36,918
- Oh. Oh, we're...
- No.

1235
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,293
No. No, its Gammy's
big birthday tomorrow night.

1236
01:03:40,329 --> 01:03:41,422
Big day for her.

1237
01:03:41,463 --> 01:03:43,556
We don't want to ruin it.
Thats you know...

1238
01:03:43,599 --> 01:03:47,331
I've had 89 birthday parties,
I don't need another one.

1239
01:03:47,369 --> 01:03:48,768
Oh, Gammy.

1240
01:03:48,804 --> 01:03:51,273
It would be a dream come true for me

1241
01:03:51,306 --> 01:03:53,672
to see my one grandchilďs wedding.

1242
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:55,974
- A dream come true!
- (Andrew) Mmmm.

1243
01:03:56,012 --> 01:03:59,208
- So you'll do it?
- (Andrew) Mmm-mmm.

1244
01:03:59,248 --> 01:04:00,909
Before I'm dead?

1245
01:04:00,949 --> 01:04:02,349
- OK. OK.
- OK.

1246
01:04:04,653 --> 01:04:06,918
OK, we will do everything.

1247
01:04:06,956 --> 01:04:09,516
And you can get married
like we did, in the barn.

1248
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:11,686
Its a Paxton family tradition.

1249
01:04:11,728 --> 01:04:14,423
- Oh, wow!
- Yup.

1250
01:04:14,463 --> 01:04:19,766
Wow! Uh! I've always wanted to
get married in a... in a barn.

1251
01:04:19,802 --> 01:04:22,134
- I have.
- Its a sign.

1252
01:04:22,172 --> 01:04:25,938
A sign from the universe that
you're meant to be together.

1253
01:04:25,974 --> 01:04:29,137
Oh, we must give thanks, I tell you.

1254
01:04:29,179 --> 01:04:32,306
Come, come. We must give thanks.

1255
01:04:32,347 --> 01:04:34,976
OK, I know I should leave you alone now.

1256
01:04:35,018 --> 01:04:38,476
But we're just so excited!
I know you're excited, too.

1257
01:04:38,521 --> 01:04:40,420
- Its the craziest.
- Really excited.

1258
01:04:40,456 --> 01:04:43,856
- (Andrew) Yeah! Go. Go.
- (Margaret laughing)

1259
01:04:43,893 --> 01:04:44,985
Go.

1260
01:04:49,431 --> 01:04:52,764
Oh, my God.

1261
01:04:52,802 --> 01:04:54,702
When my mom finds out that
this whole thing is a sham

1262
01:04:54,737 --> 01:04:56,068
she's gonna... she's gonna be crushed,

1263
01:04:56,105 --> 01:04:58,300
and my grandmother's gonna die.

1264
01:04:58,340 --> 01:04:59,967
- Your mom's not going to find out.
- I... my father.

1265
01:05:00,009 --> 01:05:01,567
What the hell's with that?
The whole wedding thing?

1266
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:02,635
Where did that come from?

1267
01:05:02,679 --> 01:05:04,909
She probably got him worked up into it.

1268
01:05:04,947 --> 01:05:06,175
Its fine. She's not gonna find out.

1269
01:05:06,215 --> 01:05:08,342
- They're not going to find out.
- Oh, God. Margaret!

1270
01:05:08,384 --> 01:05:11,842
Andrew, they're not gonna
find out, OK? Just relax.

1271
01:05:11,887 --> 01:05:13,445
Its gonna be OK.

1272
01:05:13,489 --> 01:05:15,980
Its not like we're
gonna be married forever.

1273
01:05:16,025 --> 01:05:18,619
We'll be happily divorced
before you know it.

1274
01:05:18,661 --> 01:05:23,063
It will be fine. It will be fine.

1275
01:05:23,099 --> 01:05:24,657
You OK?

1276
01:05:24,701 --> 01:05:26,327
Yeah.

1277
01:05:30,373 --> 01:05:33,398
- Get us some coffee.
- Yeah.

1278
01:05:33,443 --> 01:05:37,139
So, would you like a cinnamon soy latte?

1279
01:05:37,179 --> 01:05:38,909
- A-ha.
- (Margaret chuckles)

1280
01:05:43,552 --> 01:05:45,110
(Andrew) You're right, you know...

1281
01:05:45,153 --> 01:05:46,451
Get a quickie divorce, we'll be fine.

1282
01:05:46,489 --> 01:05:48,115
- Absolutely.
- Its gonna be fine.

1283
01:05:48,157 --> 01:05:50,523
Everything is going to be great.

1284
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:52,460
But this little missus
better learn how to cook...

1285
01:05:52,494 --> 01:05:54,326
...so she can take care of her husband.

1286
01:05:54,364 --> 01:05:55,489
Keep my man happy.

1287
01:05:55,530 --> 01:05:57,260
I don't want him leaving
me for another woman.

1288
01:05:57,300 --> 01:05:58,391
- (both laugh)
- Come on...

1289
01:05:58,434 --> 01:06:01,197
...haven't left you yet, Margaret.

1290
01:06:01,237 --> 01:06:04,103
I got it. Let go.

1291
01:06:06,009 --> 01:06:08,443
- You all right?
- Yeah, um...

1292
01:06:08,478 --> 01:06:09,967
You know what? I'm gonna go.

1293
01:06:10,012 --> 01:06:11,309
Where?

1294
01:06:11,347 --> 01:06:14,248
I just kinda feel like going outside.

1295
01:06:14,284 --> 01:06:16,809
All right. Thats the bathroom.

1296
01:06:16,853 --> 01:06:18,251
Oh, yeah. I know. I'm just, uh...

1297
01:06:18,288 --> 01:06:21,485
I'm gonna go to go to the bathroom,
and then I'm gonna go out, outside.

1298
01:06:21,523 --> 01:06:22,547
All right.

1299
01:06:23,659 --> 01:06:25,126
(exhales) All right.

1300
01:06:36,105 --> 01:06:40,974
OK, you just have to focus,
Margaret. Just focus.

1301
01:06:41,010 --> 01:06:43,773
This is a business deal.
This is just a business deal.

1302
01:06:43,813 --> 01:06:48,579
(clears throat) Everything's
gonna be just fine.

1303
01:06:49,885 --> 01:06:53,788
OK, this is a little
rough. I can do this.

1304
01:06:55,257 --> 01:06:57,726
Oh, my God. God, I hate nature!

1305
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,090
I hate it.

1306
01:06:59,128 --> 01:07:02,528
Not stopping. Not stopping. Oh! Oh...

1307
01:07:02,565 --> 01:07:04,532
Why are you not stopping?

1308
01:07:04,567 --> 01:07:07,001
(growls) Stop, stop, stop it, stop!

1309
01:07:07,036 --> 01:07:08,764
(panting)

1310
01:07:10,639 --> 01:07:13,733
I just wanted... some air.

1311
01:07:13,775 --> 01:07:18,041
(drum beating)

1312
01:07:18,081 --> 01:07:20,572
- What is that?
- (flute begins to play)

1313
01:07:20,615 --> 01:07:25,280
What now? What is that? What is that?

1314
01:07:25,320 --> 01:07:27,755
- (drum and flute continue)
- What is that?

1315
01:07:36,132 --> 01:07:40,431
(woman chanting in foreign language)

1316
01:07:40,469 --> 01:07:42,630
- (chanting continues)
- (Margaret) What is that?

1317
01:07:46,608 --> 01:07:48,634
(chanting continues)

1318
01:07:58,987 --> 01:08:02,184
(woman) Come to me,
Margaret of New York.

1319
01:08:02,224 --> 01:08:04,693
It is I, Grandma Annie.

1320
01:08:04,726 --> 01:08:06,092
Oh!

1321
01:08:06,128 --> 01:08:08,619
(Gammy) I see you are a curious one.

1322
01:08:08,664 --> 01:08:11,655
Come. See how I give
thanks to Mother Earth.

1323
01:08:11,701 --> 01:08:14,101
You know, actually,
I'm not that curious.

1324
01:08:14,137 --> 01:08:16,002
- I'll just...
- Look around you.

1325
01:08:16,037 --> 01:08:18,563
Mother Earth has provided all this...

1326
01:08:18,608 --> 01:08:23,045
...just as she brought you and
Andrew together to be joined.

1327
01:08:23,078 --> 01:08:25,707
- Oh.
- We must give thanks

1328
01:08:25,747 --> 01:08:28,944
and ask that your loins
be abundantly fertile.

1329
01:08:28,984 --> 01:08:32,443
Come. Dance with me in celebration.

1330
01:08:32,488 --> 01:08:35,820
You know, can I, can I
just thank her from here?

1331
01:08:35,858 --> 01:08:37,722
I insist!

1332
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:40,057
OK, OK, OK.

1333
01:08:40,095 --> 01:08:42,859
I will come down and dance with you.

1334
01:08:44,699 --> 01:08:47,863
Follow and learn.

1335
01:08:47,904 --> 01:08:51,670
(chants in foreign language)

1336
01:08:51,707 --> 01:08:55,837
Come on, Margaret! Feel the
rhythm of the drums. Now you.

1337
01:08:55,877 --> 01:08:57,402
- Me what?
- Chant.

1338
01:08:57,447 --> 01:08:59,005
Chant what?

1339
01:08:59,047 --> 01:09:01,175
(stammers) Whatever comes
to you. It is the way.

1340
01:09:01,216 --> 01:09:04,983
- But I don't know any chants.
- To the trees. Use your vowels.

1341
01:09:05,020 --> 01:09:08,787
- Eee. Ooo. Ooo. Eee.
- Ooo. Eee.

1342
01:09:08,824 --> 01:09:10,587
- Yes. Chant.
- Yes. Chant, chant.

1343
01:09:10,626 --> 01:09:12,752
- Eee. To the trees.
- Yes! Yes!

1344
01:09:12,795 --> 01:09:16,822
- (shouts) To the universe!
- The universe. Ah. Universe.

1345
01:09:16,865 --> 01:09:20,631
To the crazy.
To the window, the window.

1346
01:09:20,670 --> 01:09:22,331
To the wall, to the wall.

1347
01:09:22,371 --> 01:09:24,065
To the sweat drip down my balls.

1348
01:09:24,105 --> 01:09:26,539
- To all you bitches...
- Louder!

1349
01:09:26,576 --> 01:09:28,510
To the window, to the window.

1350
01:09:28,543 --> 01:09:30,273
To the walls, to the walls.

1351
01:09:30,313 --> 01:09:31,904
To the sweat drip down my balls.

1352
01:09:31,948 --> 01:09:34,212
Now all you bitches crawl.

1353
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:35,911

1354
01:09:35,952 --> 01:09:37,543

01:09:56,005 --> 01:09:59,064
(hooting)

1366
01:09:59,108 --> 01:10:01,940
Gammy! Lets take it
to the bridge! Woo!

1367
01:10:01,978 --> 01:10:04,139
* Let me see you get low
You scared, you scared

1368
01:10:04,180 --> 01:10:06,171
* Drop your ass to the flo'
You scared, you scared

1369
01:10:06,215 --> 01:10:07,773
* Let me see you get low
You scared, you scared

1370
01:10:07,817 --> 01:10:09,306
- * Drop your ass to the floor
- You scared!

1371
01:10:09,351 --> 01:10:10,819
* You scared, you scared
See you get low

1372
01:10:10,853 --> 01:10:12,319
- * You scared, you scared
- You scared.

1373
01:10:12,354 --> 01:10:14,288
* Your butt to the flo'
You scared, you scared

1374
01:10:14,323 --> 01:10:16,086
* Now stop, woo
Now wiggle it

1375
01:10:16,125 --> 01:10:18,115
* Now stop, woo
Jiggle it, just jiggle it

1376
01:10:18,159 --> 01:10:20,320
- Whatcha doing?
- * Just wiggle it

1377
01:10:21,029 --> 01:10:22,497
Oh, uh.

1378
01:10:22,532 --> 01:10:26,832
Uh... You know,
your Gammy wanted me to...

1379
01:10:26,868 --> 01:10:28,769
...you know, chant.
Chant from the heart.

1380
01:10:28,804 --> 01:10:31,295
Balls? Thats what came to your heart?

1381
01:10:31,340 --> 01:10:35,070
You know, it went with the beat.

1382
01:10:35,110 --> 01:10:36,873
Your phone arrived.

1383
01:10:36,912 --> 01:10:38,470
I'm gonna go into town
to pick it up. Wanna come?

1384
01:10:38,514 --> 01:10:41,414
Oh, yes, I want to go.
I want to go. Oh, hold on.

1385
01:10:41,449 --> 01:10:44,350
Is it, uh, OK if I go with him?

1386
01:10:44,386 --> 01:10:47,015
Whatever you do is what shall be.

1387
01:10:48,024 --> 01:10:49,184
But you're OK if I go?

1388
01:10:49,225 --> 01:10:52,682
- Fine. Go on.
- Bye, Gammy.

1389
01:10:52,728 --> 01:10:55,219
- You're a freak!
- Shut up.

1390
01:10:55,264 --> 01:10:57,731
- (Andrew laughing)
- Would you, please?

1391
01:10:58,301 --> 01:10:59,324
Ow!

1392
01:11:16,319 --> 01:11:17,479
(bell jingles)

1393
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:18,612
Hey, buddy.

1394
01:11:18,654 --> 01:11:20,382
Andrew, hey!

1395
01:11:20,422 --> 01:11:23,391
- You got that phone I ordered?
- Yes, it came in. How are you?

1396
01:11:23,426 --> 01:11:25,326
- Great. You?
- (Ramone) Good.

1397
01:11:27,229 --> 01:11:28,719
Hola.

1398
01:11:29,599 --> 01:11:32,158
Hey, hi.

1399
01:11:32,201 --> 01:11:33,828
Remember this?
(sings Relax)

1400
01:11:33,868 --> 01:11:34,961
Yes, yes.

1401
01:11:35,003 --> 01:11:37,564
Wonderful. Wonderful. Yes.

1402
01:11:37,606 --> 01:11:40,576
- Remember that?
- Yes. Yes. I know.

1403
01:11:43,746 --> 01:11:45,770
Think you made quite
an impression on Ramone.

1404
01:11:45,814 --> 01:11:48,180
Mmm-hmm, I think the part
where I burst into tears

1405
01:11:48,216 --> 01:11:49,844
just really brought us together.

1406
01:11:49,885 --> 01:11:51,351
- Yeah. Oh, guess what.
- What?

1407
01:11:51,386 --> 01:11:52,819
Fun fact about Andrew number 11:

1408
01:11:52,854 --> 01:11:54,378
- I like Pringles.
- Mm-hmm. OK.

1409
01:11:54,422 --> 01:11:55,787
They're delicious. All Hostess products.

1410
01:11:55,824 --> 01:11:57,485
Coke, never Pepsi, and beef jerky.

1411
01:11:57,525 --> 01:11:58,787
What, are you, like, 13?

1412
01:11:58,828 --> 01:12:00,420
- Mmm.
- Here we go.

1413
01:12:00,462 --> 01:12:01,690
Its all charged up, Andrew.

1414
01:12:01,730 --> 01:12:02,755
Thanks, buddy.

1415
01:12:04,600 --> 01:12:06,931
And I put your lady's number in, too.

1416
01:12:06,969 --> 01:12:08,458
- Thank you very mu...
- Milady.

1417
01:12:08,503 --> 01:12:11,769
- (squeaks)
- (chuckles)

1418
01:12:11,806 --> 01:12:13,797
Thank you, thank you very much.
Thank you.

1419
01:12:13,842 --> 01:12:15,207
Just... thank you.

1420
01:12:15,243 --> 01:12:19,408
(bell jingling)

1421
01:12:19,448 --> 01:12:22,042
Oh, my God. I have 37 messages.

1422
01:12:23,051 --> 01:12:24,417
Shit. I need a computer.

1423
01:12:24,453 --> 01:12:26,283
Is there, is there a computer
in this godforsaken town?

1424
01:12:27,155 --> 01:12:28,417
(bell jingling)

1425
01:12:29,891 --> 01:12:33,122
OK. So when it runs out,
it gives you a warning.

1426
01:12:33,162 --> 01:12:34,493
Just put in more dimes.

1427
01:12:35,898 --> 01:12:37,729
- Here you go.
- What?

1428
01:12:37,766 --> 01:12:39,701
- (Margaret) You're kidding. Dimes?
- (Gert) Come on, Kels.

1429
01:12:39,734 --> 01:12:41,202
- (Margaret) You're not kidding?
- (Andrew) I'll be outside.

1430
01:12:41,237 --> 01:12:42,568
- Yell if you need me.
- But what am I supposed...

1431
01:12:42,604 --> 01:12:44,265
(Andrew) You'll be fine.

1432
01:12:44,305 --> 01:12:46,331
(* Niall Toner Band:
Lonely Souls and Broken Hearts)

1433
01:12:46,375 --> 01:12:50,402
OK, I can figure this out.
I'm an intelligent woman.

1434
01:12:50,445 --> 01:12:52,880
Block 'em out, block 'em out,
block 'em out. There you go.

1435
01:12:52,914 --> 01:12:54,609
OK. (clears throat)

1436
01:12:54,649 --> 01:12:56,880
- Now.
- (modem beeping, dialing)

1437
01:12:56,918 --> 01:12:58,408
What is that? What is it?

1438
01:12:58,453 --> 01:13:00,614
(tone sounding)

1439
01:13:02,091 --> 01:13:05,117
(Margaret) Um, uh, excuse me? Excuse...

1440
01:13:06,228 --> 01:13:08,787
(sighs)

1441
01:13:08,831 --> 01:13:09,957
OK.

1442
01:13:12,801 --> 01:13:14,827
OK. (clears throat)

1443
01:13:16,238 --> 01:13:17,261
(exhales deeply)

1444
01:13:42,597 --> 01:13:45,260
(Margaret) So, it was nice
to see Gertrude, huh?

1445
01:13:45,301 --> 01:13:46,768
Yeah.

1446
01:13:46,801 --> 01:13:48,997
She looked really pretty today.

1447
01:13:50,405 --> 01:13:52,270
- Yeah, she did.
- Mmm-hmm.

1448
01:13:53,542 --> 01:13:56,533
Must be nice to see each other
again and just catch up.

1449
01:13:56,578 --> 01:13:58,706
Its definitely good to see her. Its...

1450
01:13:58,747 --> 01:14:00,578
...definitely, yeah.
Its been a long time.

1451
01:14:02,384 --> 01:14:04,851
Oh, there they are.
There they are. Margaret!

1452
01:14:04,886 --> 01:14:06,217
- (Gammy) Woo!
- (both laughing)

1453
01:14:06,255 --> 01:14:07,346
(Grace) We need Margaret.

1454
01:14:07,389 --> 01:14:09,948
Afraid we're going to have to
steal you away, young lady.

1455
01:14:09,992 --> 01:14:11,515
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I'm just gonna keep...

1456
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,255
No, not to worry.

1457
01:14:13,295 --> 01:14:15,627
No strippers, no chanting
in the woods. Promise.

1458
01:14:15,663 --> 01:14:17,529
- Oh, well...
- Yeah. Come on.

1459
01:14:17,565 --> 01:14:21,399
But not you. Its girl stuff.
You'd hate it.

1460
01:14:21,436 --> 01:14:23,997
- But...
- Come on.

1461
01:14:24,038 --> 01:14:25,631
Um, OK. Will I, uh...

1462
01:14:25,673 --> 01:14:27,904
...are these shoes OK
for what we're gonna do?

1463
01:14:29,278 --> 01:14:31,212
I can't believe this is happening.

1464
01:14:32,280 --> 01:14:34,841
My mother made this dress by hand.

1465
01:14:34,884 --> 01:14:38,649
In this very shop. In 1929.

1466
01:14:38,686 --> 01:14:41,679
Its funny how things
come back in style.

1467
01:14:41,724 --> 01:14:43,715
(Margaret) Just... just
finishing up the buttons.

1468
01:14:43,759 --> 01:14:45,488
Yeah, and don't worry about the fit

1469
01:14:45,528 --> 01:14:48,554
because Annie is the best
tailor in southeast Alaska.

1470
01:14:48,596 --> 01:14:49,621
Oh... Pssh.

1471
01:14:52,033 --> 01:14:53,557
Wow, incredible.

1472
01:14:53,601 --> 01:14:56,162
Maybe a tad loose in certain
areas, but otherwise...

1473
01:14:56,204 --> 01:14:59,935
Oh, sorry. I'm a bit
chesty to begin with

1474
01:14:59,975 --> 01:15:02,671
and I happened to be
knocked up when I wore this.

1475
01:15:02,711 --> 01:15:04,042
- Oh.
- (chuckling)

1476
01:15:04,078 --> 01:15:07,377
Oh, lets see if we can find your boobs.

1477
01:15:09,451 --> 01:15:12,545
- They're in there somewhere.
- Yes. Yes, they are.

1478
01:15:12,587 --> 01:15:14,418
This is like an Easter egg hunt.

1479
01:15:15,591 --> 01:15:18,082
Maybe they shrunk up
in the cold Alaskan air.

1480
01:15:18,127 --> 01:15:21,028
(all laughing)

1481
01:15:21,063 --> 01:15:24,965
- Oh! There they are.
- That... yes. That would be...

1482
01:15:25,000 --> 01:15:28,527
- (Gammy) There, lets see.
- I was thinking, if you'd like,

1483
01:15:28,570 --> 01:15:33,304
maybe we could head down your
way for the holidays this year.

1484
01:15:33,341 --> 01:15:35,537
Oh, that would, uh...
that would be nice.

1485
01:15:35,578 --> 01:15:40,072
That'd be nice. Or maybe
we could come to you, too.

1486
01:15:40,114 --> 01:15:43,845
- Well, that would be lovely.
- Mmm-hmm.

1487
01:15:43,886 --> 01:15:46,046
I would like that very much.

1488
01:15:46,087 --> 01:15:48,886
Oh, Grace, for Goďs sake.
We've got work to do.

1489
01:15:48,923 --> 01:15:51,721
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Go make yourself a cup of tea.

1490
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:54,592
I'll finish this. Go.

1491
01:15:54,630 --> 01:16:00,569
Now, lets make this
absolute perfection.

1492
01:16:00,603 --> 01:16:02,729
(Gammy chuckling)

1493
01:16:02,770 --> 01:16:08,265
Now, just one special touch
and you're ready.

1494
01:16:12,014 --> 01:16:16,814
Its been in the family
for more than 150 years.

1495
01:16:16,851 --> 01:16:18,819
Annie, its beautiful,
but I don't really think...

1496
01:16:18,854 --> 01:16:21,515
- Shh. I'm not finished.
- Oh, sorry.

1497
01:16:21,556 --> 01:16:25,048
My great-grandfather gave it
to my great-grandmother

1498
01:16:25,094 --> 01:16:27,255
when they got married.

1499
01:16:27,296 --> 01:16:29,354
They were quite a scandal, you know.

1500
01:16:29,398 --> 01:16:33,356
He was Russian and she
was Tlingit, and back then

1501
01:16:33,402 --> 01:16:36,199
you had to get approval
from every member of the tribe

1502
01:16:36,238 --> 01:16:37,569
before you got married.

1503
01:16:37,605 --> 01:16:39,163
Almost broke them up.

1504
01:16:39,207 --> 01:16:42,143
Well... how did they stay together then?

1505
01:16:42,176 --> 01:16:44,872
She was a lot like you. Tough.

1506
01:16:44,913 --> 01:16:47,849
Wouldn't take "no" for an answer.

1507
01:16:47,882 --> 01:16:51,751
She was good for him.

1508
01:16:51,787 --> 01:16:53,550
I want you to have it.

1509
01:16:53,588 --> 01:16:57,081
- I can't. Can't take this.
- I don't want to hear it.

1510
01:16:57,126 --> 01:17:00,755
Grandmothers love to give
their stuff to their grandchildren.

1511
01:17:00,796 --> 01:17:03,525
It makes us feel like we'll
still be part of your lives

1512
01:17:03,564 --> 01:17:04,963
even after we're gone.

1513
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,194
Take it.

1514
01:17:11,340 --> 01:17:12,466
(clears throat)

1515
01:17:12,507 --> 01:17:15,875
Are... are you all right, dear?

1516
01:17:17,212 --> 01:17:19,873
(exhales deeply) I, uh...

1517
01:17:21,417 --> 01:17:24,351
Uh... Well, I, um...

1518
01:17:26,521 --> 01:17:32,256
I, uh... I just, uh, I just wanted to...

1519
01:17:32,293 --> 01:17:35,057
make sure there was enough time
to get all the sewing done.

1520
01:17:35,096 --> 01:17:38,065
(chuckles) Don't you worry about that.

1521
01:17:38,100 --> 01:17:40,568
- You're gonna be beautiful.
- OK.

1522
01:17:40,601 --> 01:17:44,197
- Now lets get you out of those pins.
- OK.

1523
01:18:01,957 --> 01:18:03,787
(footsteps approaching)

1524
01:18:07,328 --> 01:18:08,454
All right.

1525
01:18:13,534 --> 01:18:17,971
This is untied. Hop on in.

1526
01:18:18,006 --> 01:18:19,030
(grunting)

1527
01:18:20,341 --> 01:18:22,742
Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

1528
01:18:23,444 --> 01:18:24,844
Whoa! What...

1529
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:26,438
Mind telling me what the hell's wrong?

1530
01:18:26,481 --> 01:18:28,176
I just needed to get
away from everybody.

1531
01:18:28,216 --> 01:18:30,242
- Whats wrong?
- Nothing! Just stop talking, please!

1532
01:18:38,694 --> 01:18:42,255
Would you mind telling me
whats happening now?

1533
01:18:42,296 --> 01:18:43,764
Margaret.

1534
01:18:46,402 --> 01:18:48,926
- Margaret!
- I forgot, OK?

1535
01:18:48,970 --> 01:18:50,164
(Andrew) You forgot what?

1536
01:18:50,204 --> 01:18:52,765
I forgot what it was
like to have a family!

1537
01:18:52,807 --> 01:18:55,173
I've been on my own since I was 16

1538
01:18:55,210 --> 01:18:58,145
and I forgot what it felt
like to have people love you

1539
01:18:58,180 --> 01:19:00,444
and make you breakfast and say, "Hey!

1540
01:19:00,481 --> 01:19:02,073
We'd love to come down
for the holidays."

1541
01:19:02,117 --> 01:19:05,609
And I say, "Well, why don't we
come up and see you instead?"

1542
01:19:05,654 --> 01:19:08,145
And give you necklaces!
And you have all that here,

1543
01:19:08,189 --> 01:19:10,851
and you have Gertrude, and
I'm... I'm just screwing it up!

1544
01:19:10,893 --> 01:19:13,122
You're not screwing it up!
I agreed to this!

1545
01:19:13,162 --> 01:19:14,220
You were there, remember?

1546
01:19:14,262 --> 01:19:15,820
Your family loves you. Do you know that?

1547
01:19:15,863 --> 01:19:17,421
- I know that! Yes!
- You know that?

1548
01:19:17,466 --> 01:19:19,127
And you're still willing
to put them through this?

1549
01:19:19,167 --> 01:19:20,192
They're not gonna find out!

1550
01:19:20,234 --> 01:19:21,532
How do you know they won't find out?

1551
01:19:21,569 --> 01:19:22,900
Because you said so yourself.

1552
01:19:22,938 --> 01:19:24,905
- I know, but what if your mother...
- You said so yourself!

1553
01:19:24,939 --> 01:19:26,134
Oh, my God, if your mother found out...

1554
01:19:26,175 --> 01:19:28,199
Whoa! Whoa!

1555
01:19:28,243 --> 01:19:29,869
- Oh, my God! What if Gammy finds out?
- The boat is moving!

1556
01:19:29,912 --> 01:19:31,345
If Gammy finds out, she's
gonna have a heart attack!

1557
01:19:31,380 --> 01:19:33,314
Stop! Its gonna be fine!

1558
01:19:33,347 --> 01:19:35,578
- She's gonna have a heart attack!
- Will you calm down! Hold on!

1559
01:19:36,518 --> 01:19:38,042
(Andrew) Whoa, whoa. Whoa!

1560
01:19:38,087 --> 01:19:41,716
Whoa! I don't think
that hijacking a boat

1561
01:19:41,756 --> 01:19:45,351
is a proper way to
express your frustration!

1562
01:19:45,394 --> 01:19:46,759
Now... Oh, great.

1563
01:19:46,795 --> 01:19:49,127
Now you decide to shut up! Margaret?

1564
01:19:49,163 --> 01:19:51,222
- (Margaret) Andrew!
- Margaret?

1565
01:19:51,265 --> 01:19:53,927
- (gasping) Andrew!
- Margaret!

1566
01:19:57,738 --> 01:19:58,796
I can't swim!

1567
01:19:58,841 --> 01:20:00,364
Margaret!

1568
01:20:00,408 --> 01:20:01,671
(Andrew) To the buoy!

1569
01:20:01,710 --> 01:20:04,177
- What?
- To the buoy!

1570
01:20:05,079 --> 01:20:06,104
OK.

1571
01:20:12,753 --> 01:20:15,018
(gasping)

1572
01:20:19,394 --> 01:20:21,760
All right, come on! Give me your hand!

1573
01:20:21,796 --> 01:20:24,265
- Hey! Give me your hand!
- (gasping)

1574
01:20:24,298 --> 01:20:26,994
Margaret! Give me...

1575
01:20:27,034 --> 01:20:28,559
Come on, give me your hand!

1576
01:20:28,604 --> 01:20:30,094
Come on, come on. I got you. I got you.

1577
01:20:31,140 --> 01:20:32,630
I got you. (grunting)

1578
01:20:33,876 --> 01:20:36,275
- (Margaret gasping, shuddering)
- Come on.

1579
01:20:36,310 --> 01:20:38,141
(grunts) What the hell
were you thinking?

1580
01:20:38,180 --> 01:20:39,841
Coulďve gotten yourself killed.

1581
01:20:39,881 --> 01:20:43,283
You turned the boat and
made me fall in, you jackass.

1582
01:20:43,318 --> 01:20:45,342
You let go of the steering wheel, Ahab.

1583
01:20:45,386 --> 01:20:48,015
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1584
01:20:48,055 --> 01:20:51,354
All right, come here.
You've got to get warm. Come on.

1585
01:20:51,393 --> 01:20:55,954
Come on. Its OK. (panting)

1586
01:20:55,997 --> 01:20:57,158
Thats OK.

1587
01:21:00,569 --> 01:21:01,796
Its OK.

1588
01:21:33,868 --> 01:21:35,359
I want to talk to both of you.

1589
01:21:48,449 --> 01:21:51,078
Your mother is never to
hear about any of this.

1590
01:22:03,398 --> 01:22:05,389
Told you I'd check up on you.

1591
01:22:06,902 --> 01:22:08,130
What did you do?

1592
01:22:08,170 --> 01:22:10,069
I got a phone call from
Mr. Gilbertson here,

1593
01:22:10,104 --> 01:22:12,368
who told me that if you were lying,

1594
01:22:12,407 --> 01:22:14,636
and he strongly believes that you are,

1595
01:22:14,676 --> 01:22:16,199
he would send you to prison.

1596
01:22:16,244 --> 01:22:18,337
So I flew him up here.

1597
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:20,404
- Dad.
- Luckily for you,

1598
01:22:20,448 --> 01:22:23,475
your father negotiated
a deal on your behalf.

1599
01:22:23,518 --> 01:22:26,748
(Gilbertson) Now, this offer's
gonna last for 20 seconds,

1600
01:22:26,787 --> 01:22:28,516
so listen closely.

1601
01:22:28,556 --> 01:22:29,649
You're gonna make a statement

1602
01:22:29,690 --> 01:22:31,351
admitting this marriage is a sham...

1603
01:22:31,393 --> 01:22:32,689
...or you're gonna go to prison.

1604
01:22:32,728 --> 01:22:34,957
You tell the truth, you're off the hook,

1605
01:22:34,997 --> 01:22:37,761
and she is going to go back to Canada.

1606
01:22:43,171 --> 01:22:45,969
Ah, well. Take the deal.

1607
01:22:46,007 --> 01:22:50,411
- I don't think so.
- Don't be stupid, Andrew.

1608
01:22:50,444 --> 01:22:52,242
You want a statement?
Here's your statement.

1609
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:53,942
I've been working for
Margaret Tate for three years.

1610
01:22:53,981 --> 01:22:56,279
Six months ago we started
dating, we fell in love.

1611
01:22:56,318 --> 01:22:58,182
I asked her to marry me, she said "yes."

1612
01:22:58,220 --> 01:23:00,414
I'll see you at the wedding.

1613
01:23:11,099 --> 01:23:12,690
Well, you know.

1614
01:23:34,021 --> 01:23:37,980
So...

1615
01:23:38,025 --> 01:23:40,688
...you sure about this?

1616
01:23:40,729 --> 01:23:42,287
Not really.

1617
01:23:46,001 --> 01:23:48,833
I mean, I am very appreciative
of what you've done,

1618
01:23:48,869 --> 01:23:49,894
but I think that...

1619
01:23:49,938 --> 01:23:51,131
You'd do the same for me.

1620
01:23:51,172 --> 01:23:52,800
Right?

1621
01:23:54,208 --> 01:23:56,541
- (knocking)
- Hope everyone is decent.

1622
01:23:56,578 --> 01:23:58,068
You need to come with me.

1623
01:23:58,113 --> 01:23:59,807
(Gammy) Now, tomorrow
is your wedding day.

1624
01:23:59,847 --> 01:24:01,509
You have to give the
Baby Maker a rest tonight.

1625
01:24:01,550 --> 01:24:03,313
Its tradition.

1626
01:24:03,351 --> 01:24:05,342
- Give your bride a kiss good night.
- We're not gonna...

1627
01:24:05,386 --> 01:24:06,614
...use the Baby Maker.

1628
01:24:06,654 --> 01:24:08,384
(Gammy) You've got your whole
lives to be together.

1629
01:24:08,422 --> 01:24:11,220
- (Andrew) OK.
- Now, come on. Come on.

1630
01:24:16,965 --> 01:24:18,488
(sighs)

1631
01:24:18,533 --> 01:24:19,726
If I don't go with her,
she's just gonna...

1632
01:24:19,768 --> 01:24:23,670
- Come right back.
- Yeah.

1633
01:24:30,645 --> 01:24:32,010
See you in the morning?

1634
01:24:33,081 --> 01:24:34,479
Yeah.

1635
01:24:47,229 --> 01:24:50,220
(indistinct chatter from TV)

1636
01:25:33,007 --> 01:25:34,372
(crowd chattering)

1637
01:25:37,511 --> 01:25:38,604
Hey, Gammy.

1638
01:25:40,414 --> 01:25:42,177
- Thanks, Gammy.
- Oh.

1639
01:25:47,721 --> 01:25:50,282
(* Pachelbel: Canon in D plays)

1640
01:26:50,417 --> 01:26:51,817
(music ends)

1641
01:26:51,853 --> 01:26:53,342
(Ramone) Everyone, please be seated.

1642
01:26:59,327 --> 01:27:00,350
Ramone.

1643
01:27:01,296 --> 01:27:02,661
(speaks Spanish)

1644
01:27:04,298 --> 01:27:09,032
We are gathered here
today to give thanks...

1645
01:27:10,005 --> 01:27:12,632
...and to celebrate...

1646
01:27:12,673 --> 01:27:15,234
...one of life's greatest moments.

1647
01:27:15,277 --> 01:27:17,108
(Ramone) To give recognition

1648
01:27:17,145 --> 01:27:21,912
to the beauty, honesty,
and unselfish ways

1649
01:27:21,949 --> 01:27:24,747
of Andrew and Margarets true love

1650
01:27:24,786 --> 01:27:27,253
in front of family and friends.

1651
01:27:27,288 --> 01:27:30,189
For it is their family and friends

1652
01:27:30,225 --> 01:27:34,524
who taught Andrew and Margaret to love.

1653
01:27:34,563 --> 01:27:39,329
So it is only right that
family and friends are all...

1654
01:27:42,837 --> 01:27:45,067
Mi amor. Do you have a question?

1655
01:27:45,907 --> 01:27:47,875
Uh, no...

1656
01:27:47,908 --> 01:27:49,399
Your hand is up.

1657
01:27:52,980 --> 01:27:56,006
Oh, it, its, uh, not a question,

1658
01:27:56,051 --> 01:27:58,314
but I do have something I need to say.

1659
01:27:58,353 --> 01:28:02,288
- Margaret.
- Can it wait till after?

1660
01:28:02,323 --> 01:28:06,851
Uh... No. No.

1661
01:28:16,805 --> 01:28:18,203
(sighs)

1662
01:28:18,238 --> 01:28:22,140
- (clears throat) Hi there.
- (all murmur) Hi.

1663
01:28:22,176 --> 01:28:24,337
Thank you all so much for coming out.

1664
01:28:24,378 --> 01:28:27,542
(Margaret) I, uh... have
a bit of an announcement

1665
01:28:27,582 --> 01:28:29,708
to make about the wedding.

1666
01:28:29,751 --> 01:28:33,050
- A confession, actually.
- What are you doing?

1667
01:28:33,087 --> 01:28:36,649
Uh... I'm a Canadian. Yes, Canadian.

1668
01:28:36,690 --> 01:28:40,854
With an expired visa
who was about to be deported.

1669
01:28:40,895 --> 01:28:42,555
And because I didn't want to leave

1670
01:28:42,596 --> 01:28:44,827
this wonderful country of yours,

1671
01:28:44,865 --> 01:28:47,801
I forced Andrew here to marry me.

1672
01:28:47,836 --> 01:28:49,269
Margaret, stop it.

1673
01:28:49,304 --> 01:28:53,171
See, Andrew has always had
this extraordinary work ethic.

1674
01:28:54,643 --> 01:28:56,304
Something I think he learned from you.

1675
01:28:57,612 --> 01:28:59,671
And for three years I
watched him work harder

1676
01:28:59,713 --> 01:29:01,681
than anyone else at our company.

1677
01:29:01,716 --> 01:29:04,980
And I knew that if I threatened
to destroy his career...

1678
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:08,216
...he would, he would do
just about anything.

1679
01:29:11,792 --> 01:29:15,819
So I blackmailed him to
come up here and to lie to you.

1680
01:29:17,966 --> 01:29:20,992
(Margaret) All of you.

1681
01:29:21,036 --> 01:29:23,765
And I thought it would
be easy to watch him do it.

1682
01:29:23,805 --> 01:29:25,863
(clears throat)

1683
01:29:25,907 --> 01:29:27,465
But it wasn't.

1684
01:29:30,345 --> 01:29:32,506
Turns out its not easy
to ruin someone's life

1685
01:29:32,546 --> 01:29:35,175
once you find out
how wonderful they are.

1686
01:29:36,650 --> 01:29:38,175
(crowd murmurs)

1687
01:29:41,422 --> 01:29:43,448
You have a beautiful family.

1688
01:29:45,292 --> 01:29:47,420
(Margaret) Don't let this
come between you.

1689
01:29:50,465 --> 01:29:52,762
This was my fault.

1690
01:29:52,801 --> 01:29:54,631
Margaret...

1691
01:29:54,668 --> 01:29:56,569
Andrew, this was a business deal,

1692
01:29:56,604 --> 01:30:00,631
and you held up your end,
but now the deal is off.

1693
01:30:01,909 --> 01:30:03,207
I'm sorry.

1694
01:30:05,113 --> 01:30:06,341
And, you, meet me at the dock.

1695
01:30:06,381 --> 01:30:08,177
You're giving me a ride to the airport.

1696
01:30:13,887 --> 01:30:15,878
(crowd chattering)

1697
01:30:22,130 --> 01:30:23,154
(chuckles)

1698
01:30:24,998 --> 01:30:27,489
- What were you thinking?
- I don't, I don't know.

1699
01:30:27,534 --> 01:30:29,127
Andrew, you lied to us.

1700
01:30:29,170 --> 01:30:30,569
Let me get my head on straight, OK?

1701
01:30:30,604 --> 01:30:32,003
I'll explain everything later.

1702
01:30:32,039 --> 01:30:34,372
I'm sorry.

1703
01:31:11,779 --> 01:31:14,646
(Margaret) You were right.
This book is special.

1704
01:31:14,681 --> 01:31:16,309
I lied because I knew publishing meant

1705
01:31:16,350 --> 01:31:17,613
I'd lose you as an assistant

1706
01:31:17,652 --> 01:31:19,881
but... you have an extraordinary eye,

1707
01:31:19,921 --> 01:31:22,947
and I'll make sure we
buy this before I leave.

1708
01:31:22,990 --> 01:31:27,121
Have an amazing life.
You deserve it. Margaret.

1709
01:31:29,363 --> 01:31:32,595
Well, that was, uh... crazy.

1710
01:31:32,634 --> 01:31:33,965
(snorts)

1711
01:31:34,002 --> 01:31:36,435
You know, people are gonna be
talking about this forever.

1712
01:31:38,338 --> 01:31:39,966
Yeah. Yeah.

1713
01:31:41,676 --> 01:31:42,801
Are you OK?

1714
01:31:44,045 --> 01:31:46,912
Yeah. No. Uh...

1715
01:31:49,082 --> 01:31:52,951
I just feel... You know
what the problem is?

1716
01:31:52,987 --> 01:31:56,184
The problem is that this woman...

1717
01:31:56,224 --> 01:31:59,751
...is a gigantic pain in my ass.

1718
01:31:59,793 --> 01:32:02,261
First there's the whole leaving
thing. I understand that.

1719
01:32:02,296 --> 01:32:05,095
Its a sham wedding.
Its kind of stressful.

1720
01:32:05,132 --> 01:32:08,158
But then she goes ahead
and she leaves this note.

1721
01:32:08,203 --> 01:32:10,068
Because she doesn't have the decency...

1722
01:32:10,104 --> 01:32:12,230
the humanity to do it to my face.

1723
01:32:12,273 --> 01:32:17,369
Three years. Three years
I work with this... this terrorist.

1724
01:32:17,412 --> 01:32:19,003
Never once has she had
a nice thing to say,

1725
01:32:19,046 --> 01:32:20,912
and then she goes ahead
and she writes this crap!

1726
01:32:20,948 --> 01:32:22,712
- Andrew.
- But none of that matters

1727
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:23,978
because we had a deal!

1728
01:32:24,018 --> 01:32:28,216
- Andrew.
- Sorry. I'm sorry. I just...

1729
01:32:28,256 --> 01:32:29,449
She just makes me a little crazy.

1730
01:32:29,489 --> 01:32:32,926
(Gert chuckles) Yeah. I can see that.

1731
01:32:32,961 --> 01:32:37,021
So you're just gonna let her go?

1732
01:32:50,310 --> 01:32:52,279
So, what now?

1733
01:32:52,313 --> 01:32:55,282
(Gilbertson) Well... now that
you're leaving voluntarily,

1734
01:32:55,315 --> 01:32:58,011
it all becomes very civilized.

1735
01:32:58,051 --> 01:33:00,815
Once we land in New York,
you have 24 hours

1736
01:33:00,854 --> 01:33:03,881
to head back to Canada.

1737
01:33:11,265 --> 01:33:13,597
- Andrew, whats happening?
- I got to talk to her.

1738
01:33:13,635 --> 01:33:14,863
- Why would you do that?
- Boys!

1739
01:33:14,903 --> 01:33:15,926
This has nothing to do with you.

1740
01:33:15,970 --> 01:33:16,993
Boys, stop it! Stop it!

1741
01:33:17,037 --> 01:33:18,528
(Joe) I'm not gonna let you do this.

1742
01:33:18,573 --> 01:33:20,039
(Andrew) I'm not asking
your permission here.

1743
01:33:20,073 --> 01:33:23,270
- (gasps)
- Annie! Joe! Joe!

1744
01:33:23,310 --> 01:33:26,507
Annie! Joe!

1745
01:33:26,546 --> 01:33:29,538
I think I'm having a heart attack.

1746
01:33:29,583 --> 01:33:31,016
- Easy. Easy.
- Somebody get a doctor!

1747
01:33:31,051 --> 01:33:32,882
- Easy, easy.
- (man) Get a doctor!

1748
01:33:36,925 --> 01:33:38,016
I got it.

1749
01:34:06,554 --> 01:34:08,283
Andrew.

1750
01:34:10,858 --> 01:34:14,259
You two need to stop fighting.

1751
01:34:14,295 --> 01:34:16,957
(Gammy) You'll never see eye to eye.

1752
01:34:18,265 --> 01:34:21,895
But you're family.

1753
01:34:25,238 --> 01:34:30,176
Promise me you'll stand by Andrew.

1754
01:34:30,211 --> 01:34:33,078
Even if... if you don't agree with him.

1755
01:34:35,449 --> 01:34:36,814
I promise.

1756
01:34:38,752 --> 01:34:41,186
Andrew.

1757
01:34:41,221 --> 01:34:47,182
Promise me you'll work harder
to be a part of this family.

1758
01:34:47,228 --> 01:34:49,252
I will.

1759
01:34:51,899 --> 01:34:54,230
(Andrew) I will, Gammy.

1760
01:34:54,268 --> 01:34:59,899
Well, then, the spirits can take me.

1761
01:34:59,940 --> 01:35:01,703
Oh, Annie.

1762
01:35:08,448 --> 01:35:10,109
Gammy?

1763
01:35:16,591 --> 01:35:18,319
I guess they're not ready for me.

1764
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:21,390
I'm feeling much better, sonny.

1765
01:35:21,429 --> 01:35:23,328
(Gammy) No need to take us
to the hospital.

1766
01:35:23,363 --> 01:35:25,161
Take us to the airport, please.

1767
01:35:25,198 --> 01:35:27,029
Mom, what? Are you faking
the heart attack?

1768
01:35:27,068 --> 01:35:28,501
- Oh, come on!
- (laughing)

1769
01:35:28,536 --> 01:35:30,367
Well, it was the only
way I could get you two

1770
01:35:30,404 --> 01:35:32,805
to shut up and get us to the airport!

1771
01:35:32,840 --> 01:35:34,899
(man) Ma'am, we're not authorized
to take you to the airport.

1772
01:35:34,942 --> 01:35:37,911
Larry Ferris, don't
make me call your mother.

1773
01:35:37,944 --> 01:35:40,105
(Larry) You got it.

1774
01:35:41,681 --> 01:35:43,979
(sighs) You scared the hell out of me.

1775
01:35:49,090 --> 01:35:53,150
Yep. You shoulďve
given up back in New York.

1776
01:35:53,194 --> 01:35:56,425
See, I'm like Eliot Ness.

1777
01:35:56,463 --> 01:35:59,557
I always get my man.

1778
01:35:59,600 --> 01:36:02,626
I'm that good.

1779
01:36:02,670 --> 01:36:04,796
Flight 1601, as soon
as you're in position,

1780
01:36:04,838 --> 01:36:06,136
you're cleared for takeoff.

1781
01:36:06,173 --> 01:36:07,300
(man on radio) Roger that, Chuck.

1782
01:36:15,349 --> 01:36:17,248
OK. Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

1783
01:36:20,421 --> 01:36:23,412
- (phone ringing)
- (chuckles)

1784
01:36:23,457 --> 01:36:25,015
Tower. Talk to me.

1785
01:36:25,059 --> 01:36:27,152
- Chuck! Its Drew Paxton.
- Hey, dude.

1786
01:36:27,194 --> 01:36:30,186
Hey, uh... I have a little
favor I need from you, buddy...

1787
01:36:30,230 --> 01:36:32,289
Margarets on that plane. I got
to talk to her. Can you stop it?

1788
01:36:32,332 --> 01:36:33,630
(Chuck) Oh, yeah!

1789
01:36:33,667 --> 01:36:35,430
I heard about your lady bailin'.

1790
01:36:35,470 --> 01:36:38,496
- Drag-ola. (laughs)
- (Andrew) Chuck! I need you

1791
01:36:38,538 --> 01:36:40,063
to stop the plane. Please.

1792
01:36:40,108 --> 01:36:42,975
I can't do that. (laughing)

1793
01:36:43,010 --> 01:36:46,342
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no! Come on!

1794
01:36:47,148 --> 01:36:48,546
Oh, no.

1795
01:36:50,717 --> 01:36:52,412
No!

1796
01:36:54,188 --> 01:36:56,087
- Whats wrong?
- Margarets on that plane.

1797
01:36:56,123 --> 01:36:58,387
- And he didn't get to tell her.
- Tell her what?

1798
01:36:58,426 --> 01:36:59,893
That he loves her.

1799
01:36:59,926 --> 01:37:02,760
So she could tell him
that she loves him, too.

1800
01:37:02,796 --> 01:37:03,957
OK, but how does he...

1801
01:37:03,997 --> 01:37:05,363
If she didn't love him,
she wouldn't have left.

1802
01:37:05,399 --> 01:37:06,889
Of course not.

1803
01:37:06,934 --> 01:37:08,457
Am I the only one not getting this?

1804
01:37:08,502 --> 01:37:12,371
- Oh, Joe!
- Chuck! Chuck! Look down.

1805
01:37:12,405 --> 01:37:13,872
Oh! Oh. Look down.

1806
01:37:13,908 --> 01:37:16,206
(Chuck)
Like... Oh, there you are!

1807
01:37:16,243 --> 01:37:18,371
Sorry, man. There was
nothing I could do.

1808
01:37:20,381 --> 01:37:22,042
Thanks, Chuck.

1809
01:37:25,118 --> 01:37:29,385
I'm sorry, son. I didn't
know how you felt about her.

1810
01:37:34,595 --> 01:37:36,186
(Grace) Honey, its gonna be OK.

1811
01:37:54,849 --> 01:37:56,680
(phone ringing)

1812
01:38:09,663 --> 01:38:11,131
Jordan?

1813
01:38:24,979 --> 01:38:26,502
(clears throat)

1814
01:38:29,449 --> 01:38:30,474
Jordan.

1815
01:38:31,851 --> 01:38:33,319
Jordan!

1816
01:38:33,354 --> 01:38:36,686
I need for you to send
the boxes in my office to...

1817
01:38:36,724 --> 01:38:38,315
...to this address, please.

1818
01:38:38,359 --> 01:38:42,693
This one right here.
This address right here. OK?

1819
01:38:42,729 --> 01:38:45,289
- Can you do that?
- Uh, yes. Sure.

1820
01:38:45,332 --> 01:38:47,198
- Good, all right. Thank you.
- Miss Tate.

1821
01:38:47,234 --> 01:38:50,431
Yes. What? What?

1822
01:38:52,305 --> 01:38:55,672
(panting) Hey.

1823
01:38:57,043 --> 01:38:59,671
Andrew.

1824
01:39:03,484 --> 01:39:06,112
Why are, why are you panting?

1825
01:39:06,153 --> 01:39:08,314
Because I've been running.

1826
01:39:08,355 --> 01:39:11,189
- Really. From Alaska?
- I need to talk to you.

1827
01:39:11,225 --> 01:39:12,920
Yeah? Well, I don't have time to talk.

1828
01:39:12,960 --> 01:39:15,359
I need to catch a 5:45 to Toronto.

1829
01:39:15,395 --> 01:39:17,091
- Margaret.
- I need the boxes to go out today.

1830
01:39:17,131 --> 01:39:18,189
I want to make sure everything is...

1831
01:39:18,231 --> 01:39:20,324
Margaret! Stop talking!

1832
01:39:22,270 --> 01:39:24,396
(all gasp)

1833
01:39:24,438 --> 01:39:25,927
(Andrew) Gotta say something.

1834
01:39:25,972 --> 01:39:27,667
- (whispering) OK.
- This will just take a sec.

1835
01:39:27,707 --> 01:39:29,608
Fine. What?

1836
01:39:30,610 --> 01:39:35,344
Three days ago, I loathed you.

1837
01:39:35,382 --> 01:39:37,578
I used to dream about you
getting hit by a cab.

1838
01:39:37,618 --> 01:39:38,914
Or poisoned.

1839
01:39:38,953 --> 01:39:42,547
- Oh, thats nice.
- I told you to stop talking.

1840
01:39:42,590 --> 01:39:45,184
Then we had our little
adventure up in Alaska

1841
01:39:45,225 --> 01:39:47,591
and things started to change.

1842
01:39:47,627 --> 01:39:50,289
Things changed when we kissed.

1843
01:39:52,265 --> 01:39:54,199
And when you told me about your tattoo.

1844
01:39:56,837 --> 01:39:59,032
Even when you checked me
out when we were naked.

1845
01:39:59,073 --> 01:40:00,438
- (all murmuring)
- (woman) Uh-huuuh.

1846
01:40:00,474 --> 01:40:01,600
Naked?

1847
01:40:01,641 --> 01:40:03,609
Well, I didn't see anything...

1848
01:40:03,644 --> 01:40:05,009
(Andrew) Yeah, you did.

1849
01:40:05,046 --> 01:40:09,311
But I didn't realize any of
this until I was standing alone.

1850
01:40:09,350 --> 01:40:13,149
In a barn... wife-less.

1851
01:40:13,186 --> 01:40:15,814
Now, you can imagine my disappointment

1852
01:40:15,855 --> 01:40:17,323
when it suddenly dawned on me

1853
01:40:17,358 --> 01:40:21,658
that the woman I love is about
to be kicked out of the country.

1854
01:40:24,265 --> 01:40:26,095
So, Margaret.

1855
01:40:28,336 --> 01:40:29,462
Marry me.

1856
01:40:32,907 --> 01:40:35,398
Because I'd like to date you.

1857
01:40:47,621 --> 01:40:50,953
Trust me. You don't really
want to be with me.

1858
01:40:50,990 --> 01:40:52,720
Yes, I do.

1859
01:40:54,362 --> 01:40:57,354
See, the thing is, there is a reason why

1860
01:40:57,398 --> 01:40:59,992
I've been alone all this time.

1861
01:41:00,033 --> 01:41:02,002
I'm comfortable that way.

1862
01:41:02,036 --> 01:41:04,060
And I think it would
just be a lot easier

1863
01:41:04,104 --> 01:41:10,135
if we forgot everything
that happened and I just left.

1864
01:41:12,011 --> 01:41:13,604
You're right.

1865
01:41:19,119 --> 01:41:21,713
That would be easier.

1866
01:41:37,505 --> 01:41:40,962
- I'm scared.
- Me, too.

1867
01:41:44,377 --> 01:41:46,505
(crowd murmurs)

1868
01:42:04,832 --> 01:42:07,766
Aren't you supposed to get down
on your knee or something?

1869
01:42:07,801 --> 01:42:09,326
I'm gonna take that as a "yes."

1870
01:42:09,369 --> 01:42:11,395
Oh, OK.

1871
01:42:14,442 --> 01:42:16,466
(crowd chattering)

1872
01:42:25,920 --> 01:42:28,854
(man) Yeah! Show her
who's boss, Andrew!

1873
01:42:28,889 --> 01:42:30,618
(laughter)

1874
01:42:31,826 --> 01:42:33,817
(clapping)

1875
01:42:36,963 --> 01:42:40,592
(Gilbertson) So, let me see
if I've got this right.

1876
01:42:40,634 --> 01:42:43,068
You two are engaged again.

1877
01:42:43,103 --> 01:42:44,661
- (Andrew) Yes.
- (Margaret) Yes.

1878
01:42:44,704 --> 01:42:46,797
For real?

1879
01:42:47,740 --> 01:42:48,900
- Yes.
- Yeah.

1880
01:42:48,943 --> 01:42:50,001
You're sure you want to
go through with this?

1881
01:42:50,043 --> 01:42:51,170
Because one wrong answer...

1882
01:42:51,212 --> 01:42:54,408
I'm gonna take you down.

1883
01:42:56,783 --> 01:42:59,479
- OK.
- OK.

1884
01:43:01,121 --> 01:43:02,417
Lets do it.

1885
01:43:11,865 --> 01:43:13,390
(Gilbertson) When did you
first start to date?

1886
01:43:13,434 --> 01:43:15,298
Last week.

1887
01:43:15,336 --> 01:43:18,567
- (Gilbertson) That going well?
- So far its great. Thank you.

1888
01:43:18,605 --> 01:43:20,095
(Gilbertson) What kind of
deodorant does Andrew use?

1889
01:43:20,140 --> 01:43:21,698
Men's Speed Stick?

1890
01:43:21,742 --> 01:43:25,041
(Gilbertson) What flavor? Musk? Alpine?

1891
01:43:25,078 --> 01:43:26,376
Was it love at first sight?

1892
01:43:26,412 --> 01:43:28,539
(inhales) No.

1893
01:43:28,582 --> 01:43:32,416
I loved her from the beginning.

1894
01:43:32,453 --> 01:43:33,715
(Gilbertson) What side of the
bed does Margaret sleep on?

1895
01:43:33,753 --> 01:43:35,483
She sleeps on the left.

1896
01:43:35,523 --> 01:43:36,956
What side of the bed do you sleep on?

1897
01:43:38,993 --> 01:43:43,327
Look, are they soul mates? Eeeh.

1898
01:43:43,363 --> 01:43:45,992
Uh... Will they kill each other? No.

1899
01:43:46,033 --> 01:43:47,158
(Gilbertson) Are you a good driver?

1900
01:43:47,201 --> 01:43:49,795
Oh, excellent driver. Excellent.

1901
01:43:49,837 --> 01:43:53,533
(makes crashing,
screaming, siren sounds)

1902
01:43:53,573 --> 01:43:55,974
Oh.

1903
01:43:56,010 --> 01:43:59,002
In my mind I see her
with someone perhaps...

1904
01:43:59,046 --> 01:44:00,945
...more swarthy, darker.

1905
01:44:00,980 --> 01:44:03,609
We don't use the word
"Margaret" around Kevin.

1906
01:44:03,650 --> 01:44:07,951
He still hasn't warmed up to her.

1907
01:44:07,988 --> 01:44:09,682
- Margaret.
- (barks)

1908
01:44:09,722 --> 01:44:11,713
- Margaret.
- (barks)

1909
01:44:11,759 --> 01:44:13,488
See? Its the damnedest thing.

1910
01:44:13,527 --> 01:44:15,154
I have never farted in front of him.

1911
01:44:15,194 --> 01:44:17,595
Nor will I ever fart in front of him.

1912
01:44:17,631 --> 01:44:20,155
She farts in her sleep.

1913
01:44:20,199 --> 01:44:22,100
(Gilbertson) Would you consider
Margaret a good dancer?

1914
01:44:22,136 --> 01:44:25,367
You can tell by the way
she drinks her soda pop

1915
01:44:25,405 --> 01:44:27,771
that she's a good dancer.

1916
01:44:27,807 --> 01:44:29,036
(Gilbertson) Uh-huh. How, how...

1917
01:44:29,076 --> 01:44:33,512
How is the soda pop
relevant to the dancing?

1918
01:44:33,546 --> 01:44:35,207
I don't understand this.

1919
01:44:35,248 --> 01:44:38,184
- I call him... puppy.
- Pumpkin.

1920
01:44:38,217 --> 01:44:39,878
- Monkey.
- Daisy.

1921
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:42,114
- Kiddo.
- Uh... Bird.

1922
01:44:42,155 --> 01:44:45,353
Sometimes I call him Rick.

1923
01:44:45,391 --> 01:44:46,859
(Gilbertson) How do you spell "Ramone?"

1924
01:44:46,894 --> 01:44:49,761
(thickly accented) R-A-M-O-N-E.

1925
01:44:49,796 --> 01:44:51,697
(Gilbertson) Could you do that
again in English, please?

1926
01:44:51,731 --> 01:44:54,599
When you say, you know, the
position in the relationship...

1927
01:44:54,635 --> 01:44:56,000
(Gilbertson) Top or bottom?

1928
01:44:56,036 --> 01:44:59,005
You're asking me a question
about who's on top?

1929
01:44:59,038 --> 01:45:00,768
(Gilbertson) You took an oath
when you walked in this office.

1930
01:45:00,807 --> 01:45:03,275
I did not take an oath.
When did I take an oath?

1931
01:45:03,310 --> 01:45:04,572
(Gilbertson) Laura shoulďve
done that, but she didn't.

1932
01:45:04,612 --> 01:45:06,476
- Thats OK.
- Who's Laura?

1933
01:45:06,512 --> 01:45:08,845
She's the girl behind you.
Don't look around.

1934
01:45:08,881 --> 01:45:10,144
(Gilbertson) Which of
the following numbers

1935
01:45:10,184 --> 01:45:12,981
- is not a prime?
- Seventeen.

1936
01:45:13,020 --> 01:45:15,180
I'm sorry. Let me say the list, please.

1937
01:45:15,221 --> 01:45:16,246
I'm sorry?

1938
01:45:16,289 --> 01:45:17,551
(Gilbertson) He knew
your favorite color.

1939
01:45:17,591 --> 01:45:19,217
- Blue?
- (Gilbertson) Wrong!

1940
01:45:19,259 --> 01:45:20,783
- Red?
- No!

1941
01:45:20,828 --> 01:45:22,351
Dark... Maybe like a hunter green?

1942
01:45:22,395 --> 01:45:23,795
(Gilbertson) No. White.

1943
01:45:23,831 --> 01:45:25,092
- White?
- OK, moving on.

1944
01:45:25,131 --> 01:45:26,530
Favorite color is blue.

1945
01:45:26,567 --> 01:45:30,469
Whats her favorite color
when she's not at home?

1946
01:45:30,503 --> 01:45:31,903
I don't know.

1947
01:45:31,939 --> 01:45:33,702
(Gilbertson) Are you a citizen
of this country, Ramone?

1948
01:45:33,740 --> 01:45:37,609
Yes, I'm a citizen!
(guffawing) Are you crazy?

1949
01:45:37,645 --> 01:45:39,613
(laughs)

1950
01:45:39,646 --> 01:45:42,547
What relevance a ball in a net

1951
01:45:42,582 --> 01:45:44,516
or a Fruit Roll-Up or a Pop-Tart

1952
01:45:44,551 --> 01:45:47,110
has to do with my
relationship with Andrew?

1953
01:45:47,154 --> 01:45:48,677
(Gilbertson) If you're
getting excited...

1954
01:45:48,721 --> 01:45:51,850
- Who are you engaged to?
- (sighs)

1955
01:45:51,891 --> 01:45:56,090
- Andrew.
- Very good. Got one right.

1956
01:45:56,130 --> 01:45:57,289
(Gilbertson) Who are you engaged to?

1957
01:45:57,331 --> 01:45:59,025
I'm engaged to Margaret Tate.

1958
01:45:59,065 --> 01:46:04,527
And on the wedding day,
who will be next to you?

1959
01:46:04,570 --> 01:46:06,868
I'm going to marry Margaret Tate.

1960
01:46:06,907 --> 01:46:09,603
- (Gilbertson) Final answer?
- That work? Yeah, final answer.

1961
01:46:09,643 --> 01:46:12,942
Is this a game show?
I don't understand what...

1962
01:46:12,979 --> 01:46:16,676
(sings God Bless America)

1963
01:46:20,054 --> 01:46:21,520
That's a great song.

1964
01:46:21,555 --> 01:46:23,283
(Gilbertson) That was beautiful.
That was really beautiful.

1965
01:46:23,323 --> 01:46:24,984
Mama Cass.

1966
01:46:26,081 --> 01:46:36,311
THE END
