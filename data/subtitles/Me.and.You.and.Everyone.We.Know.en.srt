1
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,171
If you really love me,
then let's make a vow...

2
00:00:43,272 --> 00:00:46,208
right here, together...

3
00:00:46,313 --> 00:00:48,135
right now.

4
00:00:48,233 --> 00:00:50,372
- Okay?
- Okay.

5
00:00:52,873 --> 00:00:56,101
All right.
Repeat after me...

6
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:59,134
I'm gonna be free.

7
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,142
I'm gonna be free.

8
00:01:02,247 --> 00:01:04,767
And I'm gonna be brave.

9
00:01:04,871 --> 00:01:08,036
I'm gonna be brave.

10
00:01:08,136 --> 00:01:11,300
Good.
And the next one is...

11
00:01:11,399 --> 00:01:15,774
I'm gonna live each day,
as if it were my last.

12
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:18,181
Oh, that's good.
You like that? Yeah. Say it.

13
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:22,557
I'm gonna live each day,
as if it were my last.

14
00:01:22,663 --> 00:01:25,281
Fantastically.

15
00:01:25,382 --> 00:01:27,292
Fantastically.

16
00:01:27,399 --> 00:01:30,398
Courageously.

17
00:01:30,503 --> 00:01:32,805
Courageously.

18
00:01:32,903 --> 00:01:34,724
With grace.

19
00:01:35,782 --> 00:01:37,954
<i>With grace.</i>

20
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,732
You don't have to
bubble-wrap everything.

21
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:48,383
It's not like you're moving
to the north pole.

22
00:01:51,141 --> 00:01:53,531
Oh. That's not yours.

23
00:01:53,638 --> 00:01:55,612
My father gave us that.

24
00:01:57,157 --> 00:01:59,808
This is yours.

25
00:02:12,454 --> 00:02:14,079
Remember this?

26
00:02:15,365 --> 00:02:16,478
Oh, no.

27
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:20,542
Can we just do this
without any theatrics? Please.

28
00:02:20,645 --> 00:02:23,362
- We should have some kind of ceremony.
- What?

29
00:02:23,462 --> 00:02:25,349
You know, with the boys.

30
00:02:25,444 --> 00:02:29,338
Some kind of thing, so,
they don't forget we were once...

31
00:02:36,933 --> 00:02:40,316
What are you doing?
Richard?

32
00:02:41,189 --> 00:02:42,498
Leave them alone.

33
00:02:44,645 --> 00:02:47,644
- Do I look well to you guys?
- You should be in here packing.

34
00:02:49,925 --> 00:02:53,340
Objectively speaking,
if you weren't my children...

35
00:02:53,444 --> 00:02:56,706
would you think,
that guy looks okay?

36
00:02:56,804 --> 00:02:59,903
He looks like a guy who might
have a wife and kids and stuff?

37
00:03:00,004 --> 00:03:03,265
- Are you mad at us?
- Yeah, totally. I think you look good.

38
00:03:03,365 --> 00:03:06,014
Okay, good.

39
00:03:10,468 --> 00:03:12,769
Space, space, dash.

40
00:03:12,869 --> 00:03:14,810
Is that a Bengal tiger?

41
00:03:15,876 --> 00:03:17,567
I don't know.

42
00:03:20,228 --> 00:03:22,781
Space, space, space.

43
00:03:24,996 --> 00:03:26,556
Dash.

44
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:40,098
<i>And in the dark of the night,
and it does get dark...</i>

45
00:03:40,196 --> 00:03:42,496
<i>when I call a name...</i>

46
00:03:42,594 --> 00:03:44,569
<i>When I call a name.</i>

47
00:03:44,674 --> 00:03:46,976
<i>It'll be your name.</i>

48
00:03:48,195 --> 00:03:50,235
<i>What's your name?
Never mind.</i>

49
00:03:50,338 --> 00:03:53,688
<i>Let's go. Say it.
Let's go. Everywhere.</i>

50
00:03:53,795 --> 00:03:55,616
<i>Everywhere. Even though...</i>

51
00:03:55,714 --> 00:03:59,097
<i>Even though...
We're scared.</i>

52
00:03:59,202 --> 00:04:00,893
<i>We're scared.</i>

53
00:04:00,994 --> 00:04:04,736
<i>'Cause it's life...
It's life.</i>

54
00:04:04,834 --> 00:04:09,655
<i>And it's happening.
It's really, really happening...</i>

55
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,890
<i>right now.</i>

56
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:36,949
All right. Now let's kiss
to make it real, okay?

57
00:04:37,057 --> 00:04:39,359
Okay.

58
00:05:35,617 --> 00:05:37,853
So, how is your art project?

59
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:42,301
- Is it in the museum yet?
- No. That's not how it works.

60
00:05:42,399 --> 00:05:44,221
You know, they have to know
about your work...

61
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:47,635
I would just march in there
and show it to them, you know?

62
00:05:47,744 --> 00:05:50,296
No one is going to
live your life for you.

63
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:54,044
Okay. That's not
how it works, but okay.

64
00:05:55,424 --> 00:05:57,048
So, how's Ellen?

65
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:59,539
Oh, she's wonderful.

66
00:05:59,646 --> 00:06:02,613
I can't sleep at night
thinking about her.

67
00:06:02,719 --> 00:06:05,173
I just wish,
I had met her 50 years sooner.

68
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:08,181
- Yeah.
- But then maybe I needed...

69
00:06:08,287 --> 00:06:10,294
70 years of life...

70
00:06:10,398 --> 00:06:13,148
to be ready
for a woman like Ellen.

71
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:17,881
<i>This rug is dirty.</i>

72
00:06:17,983 --> 00:06:20,536
Everyone get a box
on the way out.

73
00:06:32,477 --> 00:06:36,821
Ow. Ow. Stop kicking me.
Ow. Stop kicking me!

74
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,208
You know, some kids don't even have
one home. Now you get to have two.

75
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:47,132
Think about that.

76
00:06:53,854 --> 00:06:58,130
What I don't get was how angry Pam was.
I didn't hurt anyone but myself.

77
00:06:58,236 --> 00:07:00,953
- It's not like I robbed a bank.
- Yeah, or bombed a church.

78
00:07:01,053 --> 00:07:02,777
Do you have this
in an eight and a half?

79
00:07:04,317 --> 00:07:07,448
- I believe we do. I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

80
00:07:07,549 --> 00:07:09,786
Or bombed a church.

81
00:07:09,886 --> 00:07:12,603
In some cultures, when you burn
yourself it's a ceremony.

82
00:07:12,701 --> 00:07:14,643
It's called self-immolation.

83
00:07:14,749 --> 00:07:17,170
My uncle used to do it all the time.
It was a great trick.

84
00:07:17,277 --> 00:07:19,132
He'd put the stuff on it and light it...

85
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,750
and it would just go out
when he went like this.

86
00:07:21,854 --> 00:07:25,431
Right before I lit it,
I suddenly remembered...

87
00:07:25,533 --> 00:07:29,045
it's alcohol that burns
but doesn't burn up.

88
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:31,091
Lighter fluid just burns.

89
00:07:31,197 --> 00:07:35,899
And then I thought,
"It's okay. It's better this way."

90
00:07:45,371 --> 00:07:48,885
I just think of it as part
of good service, you know?

91
00:07:48,988 --> 00:07:52,403
No. No, we don't
touch the foot anymore.

92
00:07:52,507 --> 00:07:55,290
If you notice, we spend
a lot of time touching the shoe...

93
00:07:55,387 --> 00:07:57,297
lacing the shoe...

94
00:07:57,404 --> 00:08:01,015
then we just put it on the ground
and watch you try to get your foot in.

95
00:08:01,116 --> 00:08:03,833
We can hand you tools...
a shoehorn, a nylon sock...

96
00:08:03,931 --> 00:08:07,127
but we will never
touch your foot with our hands.

97
00:08:07,227 --> 00:08:09,594
Now, I'll tell you what I can do.

98
00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:12,212
I can press on the shoe
to see if it fits.

99
00:08:12,315 --> 00:08:14,966
- I can go like this.
- Yeah, do that.

100
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,798
- How does that feel on the toe?
- Good.

101
00:08:27,899 --> 00:08:30,648
Good. Why don't you
walk around in them?

102
00:08:41,243 --> 00:08:45,171
- Did you want to try these on?
- No, I'm just driving him.

103
00:08:46,395 --> 00:08:49,362
- So those are comfortable?
- I guess so.

104
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,559
I mean, they kind of rub my ankles,
but all shoes do that.

105
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:54,804
I have low ankles.

106
00:08:55,962 --> 00:08:59,606
You think you deserve
that pain, but you don't.

107
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:03,568
- I don't think I deserve it.
- Well, not consciously maybe.

108
00:09:04,762 --> 00:09:06,485
My ankles are just low.

109
00:09:06,586 --> 00:09:08,855
People think foot pain
is a fact of life...

110
00:09:08,954 --> 00:09:10,809
but life is actually better than that.

111
00:09:10,905 --> 00:09:12,913
I'll say.
You should get some.

112
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:17,688
Your whole life could be better.
Starting right now.

113
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,478
<i>I can't believe I got these shoes.</i>

114
00:09:29,017 --> 00:09:32,792
<i>And they're exactly like my old shoes,
except they're pink.</i>

115
00:09:32,889 --> 00:09:36,053
<i>I don't need these,
and they're not orthopedic.</i>

116
00:09:36,154 --> 00:09:38,095
<i>But you seemed to believe
everything he said.</i>

117
00:09:38,201 --> 00:09:41,497
<i>Yeah. I think he really knew his stuff.
He was very professional.</i>

118
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:44,047
<i>See, that's how gullible you are.</i>

119
00:09:44,152 --> 00:09:47,022
- You know, you meet somebody...
- Christine.

120
00:09:47,129 --> 00:09:48,917
Oh, God.

121
00:09:49,016 --> 00:09:50,674
Roll down your window.
We have to tell him.

122
00:09:50,776 --> 00:09:53,459
No. If he stops, it'll fall off.

123
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:56,277
Even if he slows down, it'll fall.

124
00:09:56,376 --> 00:09:58,352
The best thing
for that fish would be...

125
00:09:58,456 --> 00:10:02,798
if he could just drive
steadily... forever.

126
00:10:06,903 --> 00:10:09,970
I guess these are
his last moments of life.

127
00:10:12,151 --> 00:10:14,192
Shall we say some words?

128
00:10:16,536 --> 00:10:18,359
I didn't know you...

129
00:10:19,576 --> 00:10:23,853
but I want you to die
knowing that you were loved.

130
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:27,603
I love you.

131
00:10:39,287 --> 00:10:43,477
Hey. It was on your roof!

132
00:10:43,575 --> 00:10:45,746
We'll go in front of you!

133
00:10:45,847 --> 00:10:47,789
- Pull in front of him.
- Okay.

134
00:10:47,895 --> 00:10:50,830
We've got to keep him
at a steady speed.

135
00:10:53,623 --> 00:10:55,728
Just keep them steady.

136
00:10:57,143 --> 00:11:01,103
Oh, God. That little girl
is gonna have to watch it.

137
00:11:01,206 --> 00:11:03,443
But at least they know.

138
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:05,910
At least we're
all together on this.

139
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:16,523
When me and Pam
were first in love...

140
00:12:16,629 --> 00:12:18,800
we hated to be apart,
even for an hour.

141
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:21,683
Oh, yeah.
I had something like that once.

142
00:12:21,781 --> 00:12:24,268
- A real fuck-a-thon.
- We just slept.

143
00:12:24,372 --> 00:12:27,154
We loved to sleep
when it was time to sleep.

144
00:12:27,253 --> 00:12:28,845
Not sex.

145
00:12:28,949 --> 00:12:31,501
I mean, we had sex...

146
00:12:31,604 --> 00:12:35,565
but what we really loved
was to sleep like babies all day long.

147
00:12:35,668 --> 00:12:37,490
That sounds perfect.

148
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:40,206
I don't want to have to do this...
this living.

149
00:12:40,308 --> 00:12:42,447
I just walk around.

150
00:12:42,548 --> 00:12:44,523
I want to be swept off my feet,
you know?

151
00:12:44,627 --> 00:12:46,994
I want my children
to have magical powers.

152
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:50,922
I am prepared for amazing things
to happen. I can handle it.

153
00:12:53,268 --> 00:12:54,861
Ellen.

154
00:12:56,084 --> 00:12:58,834
Guess who's joining the Olympics?

155
00:13:02,451 --> 00:13:05,200
- Guess who's joining the Olympics?
- Who?

156
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:08,081
- Me.
- Really?

157
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:11,346
- How is the love of my life?
- Can I borrow this?

158
00:13:12,467 --> 00:13:15,500
Of course.
Which one is that?

159
00:13:17,363 --> 00:13:21,520
Ohh. My granddaughter
and her boyfriend who won't marry her...

160
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:24,521
are going to become art.

161
00:14:04,049 --> 00:14:06,919
That's a limited access floor.
You need a swipe card.

162
00:14:07,025 --> 00:14:09,360
Oh. I'll just get off on two then.

163
00:14:11,249 --> 00:14:13,583
You want the offices?

164
00:14:13,681 --> 00:14:16,583
- Actually, are you Nancy Herrington?
- Yes.

165
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,406
Okay. 'Cause I wanted
to show you my art.

166
00:14:19,505 --> 00:14:22,156
I brought this tape
I thought we could watch.

167
00:14:22,257 --> 00:14:25,640
Okay. Why don't
you send it to this address.

168
00:14:25,745 --> 00:14:27,632
Oh, but that's here.

169
00:14:27,729 --> 00:14:29,737
Can't I just hand it to you?

170
00:14:29,841 --> 00:14:32,044
It'll get lost.
It's better if you send it.

171
00:14:33,616 --> 00:14:35,983
But I'm so close.

172
00:14:39,696 --> 00:14:43,045
Okay. Do I need
the thing to get out?

173
00:14:43,153 --> 00:14:46,502
Oh, great, you're here.
Let's go down.

174
00:15:03,792 --> 00:15:05,646
Look at this.

175
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:08,974
Wow, that's amazing.

176
00:15:09,072 --> 00:15:11,341
Were you able to talk to Patrick
about the maintenance?

177
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,447
Yeah, we spoke this morning.

178
00:15:13,552 --> 00:15:16,552
Well, it really is amazing.
It just looks so real.

179
00:15:16,655 --> 00:15:19,820
Like this wrapper. It looks like
a real hamburger wrapper.

180
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,182
- Oh, that wrapper is real.
- What?

181
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,320
Yeah. I always throw in
a few real things.

182
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,790
Kind of cast a glow
over the plaster objects.

183
00:15:27,887 --> 00:15:30,506
You know, kind of
bump it all up a notch.

184
00:15:30,607 --> 00:15:33,640
Did you do this at the MoMA show?

185
00:15:33,743 --> 00:15:36,426
Were there real things
in that show, or...

186
00:15:36,527 --> 00:15:38,283
Oh, yeah. Course.

187
00:15:38,382 --> 00:15:42,441
This is mine. You got it
from the staff kitchen.

188
00:15:42,543 --> 00:15:44,267
No, I made that.

189
00:16:26,478 --> 00:16:29,794
This stuff is really good for your skin.
It has like all these minerals in it.

190
00:16:29,902 --> 00:16:32,324
- Let me see!
- Let me just finish!

191
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:35,396
- It doesn't match at all.
- It will. Let me just finish.

192
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:40,676
My skin is way lighter than yours.

193
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:45,058
Okay. Just wait. You'll see.
I just have to do your whole face first.

194
00:16:47,725 --> 00:16:50,594
- What are...Where are you going?
- I don't have to come in till 2:00.

195
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:53,090
- Oh, see you at 2:00 then.
- Okay. See ya.

196
00:16:53,197 --> 00:16:54,790
Guy at 1:00.

197
00:16:56,877 --> 00:16:59,299
Not cute. Say hi.

198
00:16:59,405 --> 00:17:01,161
Hi.

199
00:17:01,261 --> 00:17:02,821
Hi.

200
00:17:07,181 --> 00:17:09,417
- That doesn't match your skin color.
- I know.

201
00:17:09,516 --> 00:17:11,010
It doesn't.

202
00:17:11,116 --> 00:17:14,150
Do you want me to finish, or do you
want me to leave it how it is?

203
00:17:17,836 --> 00:17:20,225
Are you guys like girlfriends?

204
00:17:23,757 --> 00:17:25,066
Maybe.

205
00:17:25,165 --> 00:17:27,139
You look like
you could be sisters.

206
00:17:27,244 --> 00:17:29,994
- Maybe we're sisters and girlfriends.
- Yeah, that'd be pretty cool.

207
00:17:30,092 --> 00:17:32,361
But that's pretty unlikely.

208
00:17:32,461 --> 00:17:34,794
- How old are you guys anyways?
- Eighteen.

209
00:17:34,891 --> 00:17:37,477
I'm 18. She's 17.

210
00:17:37,579 --> 00:17:41,027
- I turn 18 next week.
- Yeah, I'd really love to believe you.

211
00:17:41,132 --> 00:17:45,507
I really would, because I don't even
have to go to work this morning.

212
00:17:45,612 --> 00:17:48,611
I would love to believe
in a universe...

213
00:17:48,716 --> 00:17:51,529
where you wake up
and you don't have to go to work...

214
00:17:51,626 --> 00:17:56,994
and you step outside and meet
two beautiful 18-year-old sisters...

215
00:17:57,099 --> 00:17:59,946
who are also girlfriends...

216
00:18:00,043 --> 00:18:03,818
and... are also very nice people.

217
00:18:03,915 --> 00:18:06,816
You guys seem
like very nice people.

218
00:18:06,923 --> 00:18:08,548
We are nice.

219
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,853
What would you do...

220
00:18:10,954 --> 00:18:14,118
if you believed we were 18,
which we are?

221
00:18:14,218 --> 00:18:17,513
Well, I can't even tell ya.

222
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,944
- I can't tell you till you're 18.
- That's not true.

223
00:18:20,042 --> 00:18:22,530
What about freedom of speech
and the Constitution?

224
00:18:22,635 --> 00:18:25,863
- What are you talkin' about?
- Free speech.

225
00:18:25,963 --> 00:18:28,483
Okay. Well, I don't know
what you're talking about...

226
00:18:28,586 --> 00:18:31,139
but I can't talk dirty to you...

227
00:18:31,242 --> 00:18:34,819
because then I'd be a pervert...

228
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:37,888
and probably even
a pedophile too, so...

229
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:40,612
- No one has ever talked dirty to us.
- Really?

230
00:18:40,713 --> 00:18:42,983
Sounds very appealing.

231
00:18:44,554 --> 00:18:46,376
I'm gonna go inside now.

232
00:18:46,474 --> 00:18:48,296
Okay. We'll wave to you.

233
00:18:48,394 --> 00:18:50,598
- Make sure to look.
- I will.

234
00:19:04,074 --> 00:19:06,724
- Oh, he's probably jerking off.
- Oh, my God!

235
00:19:06,825 --> 00:19:09,345
He is. You can so tell he is.

236
00:19:09,449 --> 00:19:13,573
- How?
- I can feel it.

237
00:19:13,673 --> 00:19:16,934
See that crack?
That's where his hard-on is.

238
00:19:19,305 --> 00:19:21,312
Let's kiss.

239
00:19:21,417 --> 00:19:23,239
Okay.

240
00:19:40,328 --> 00:19:43,263
- Are my little chickies still hungry?
- Yes.

241
00:19:43,368 --> 00:19:47,111
Peep. Okay, worm check.

242
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,753
Open up. Are there any worms
left in there?

243
00:19:52,647 --> 00:19:54,470
You live next door to me.

244
00:19:54,568 --> 00:19:57,088
- No, I don't.
- I saw you moving in.

245
00:19:57,192 --> 00:20:00,061
You have a white dad
and a big brother.

246
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:02,306
Your whole family lives
in one of those little apartments?

247
00:20:02,408 --> 00:20:04,415
Do you all have to sleep
in the same bed?

248
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:06,340
My mom lives somewhere else.

249
00:20:07,463 --> 00:20:09,285
You should get a Hide-a-bed.
During the day it's a couch...

250
00:20:09,383 --> 00:20:12,514
but at night it folds out into
a comfortable queen-sized bed.

251
00:20:15,942 --> 00:20:18,878
You want to be a little bird
and get a little worm?

252
00:20:18,983 --> 00:20:20,445
Just lie down and peep.

253
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:24,350
Peep, peep, peep.

254
00:20:32,935 --> 00:20:34,822
Are you following us?

255
00:20:34,918 --> 00:20:36,958
Yeah, quit following us,
Peter Swersey!

256
00:20:37,062 --> 00:20:40,128
If you don't stop following us,
I'm gonna scream!

257
00:20:41,637 --> 00:20:45,761
If you take another step towards me,
I'm going to kick you in the throat!

258
00:20:49,542 --> 00:20:51,298
Hey, come here.

259
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:42,531
Ask her if she likes bologna.

260
00:21:44,805 --> 00:21:46,147
What are you putting?

261
00:21:46,245 --> 00:21:48,417
I asked her what kind
of "bossom" she had.

262
00:21:48,518 --> 00:21:51,331
- It's probably a man.
- Why is it a man?

263
00:21:51,428 --> 00:21:53,500
'Cause everyone just
makes stuff up on these things.

264
00:21:53,604 --> 00:21:55,459
It's probably a man
pretending to be a woman.

265
00:21:55,556 --> 00:21:57,792
So picture a fat guy
with a little wiener.

266
00:21:59,203 --> 00:22:02,019
- What's a "bossom"?
- It's a nice word for titties.

267
00:22:02,117 --> 00:22:05,346
- Where's Mom?
- What do you mean?

268
00:22:05,444 --> 00:22:07,713
What do you think
she's doing right now?

269
00:22:07,812 --> 00:22:09,567
I don't know. Screwing
her new boyfriend probably.

270
00:22:09,667 --> 00:22:12,384
- I think she's buying us presents.
- Yeah, Robby.

271
00:22:12,483 --> 00:22:14,904
Right now she's probably
buying us each a car!

272
00:22:17,156 --> 00:22:21,214
- It's a man.
- I think it's a woman. I can tell it is.

273
00:22:21,316 --> 00:22:24,414
What should we write?
"I have a big wiener"?

274
00:22:26,147 --> 00:22:29,214
I want to poop back and forth.

275
00:22:29,316 --> 00:22:31,420
What? What does that mean?

276
00:22:31,523 --> 00:22:34,108
Like, I'll poop into her butt hole...

277
00:22:34,211 --> 00:22:36,763
and then she'll poop it back...

278
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:39,355
into my butt hole.

279
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,719
And then we'll just
keep doing it back and forth...

280
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,062
with the same poop.

281
00:22:45,378 --> 00:22:47,517
Oh, my God.
I'm going to put that!

282
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:50,107
"I want to poop...

283
00:22:50,211 --> 00:22:53,058
back and forth."

284
00:22:53,154 --> 00:22:56,154
Oh, God. She's gonna think
we're a crazy, perverted person.

285
00:23:01,123 --> 00:23:04,439
- Ooh! She thinks we're crazy!
- No, tell her like how I said it.

286
00:23:04,547 --> 00:23:07,416
No, she'll never write back. We have to
sound like we're a man, you know?

287
00:23:07,522 --> 00:23:09,245
That's just lame. It's stupid.

288
00:23:09,346 --> 00:23:13,088
But you said I could do half,
and you've done all of them before this.

289
00:23:13,186 --> 00:23:15,804
Whatever. We're probably gonna
get arrested. What do you want me to put?

290
00:23:15,906 --> 00:23:17,815
Like how I said it.

291
00:23:17,922 --> 00:23:23,007
"I'll poop in your butt hole...

292
00:23:23,106 --> 00:23:27,001
and then you will poop it back...

293
00:23:27,106 --> 00:23:30,816
into my butt...

294
00:23:30,914 --> 00:23:35,224
and we will keep doing it"...

295
00:23:37,026 --> 00:23:39,130
- Back...
- Back...

296
00:23:39,233 --> 00:23:41,176
- And forth...
- And forth...

297
00:23:41,282 --> 00:23:43,169
With the same poop.

298
00:23:43,266 --> 00:23:45,054
Same poop.

299
00:23:45,153 --> 00:23:47,455
Forever.

300
00:24:33,344 --> 00:24:36,093
Wow, look at these beds!

301
00:24:36,192 --> 00:24:39,290
You don't have to make the beds.
I'll make 'em when I get home from work.

302
00:24:39,391 --> 00:24:42,009
Where'd you learn
to make corners like that?

303
00:24:42,111 --> 00:24:44,119
It's just the way we like it.

304
00:24:44,223 --> 00:24:47,572
Really? I thought you preferred
the rumpled, unkempt look.

305
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:50,265
- We like it this way now.
- Yeah.

306
00:24:50,366 --> 00:24:53,215
At Mom's house,
we have a chore wheel.

307
00:24:53,312 --> 00:24:55,002
- What?
- Nothing.

308
00:24:55,104 --> 00:24:56,827
A chore wheel.

309
00:24:56,927 --> 00:25:00,605
You put chores on it,
and then you can spin it.

310
00:25:00,703 --> 00:25:03,486
There's this metal thing...

311
00:25:03,583 --> 00:25:05,788
and it helps it to spin.

312
00:25:05,887 --> 00:25:09,268
It's spinning from the metal.

313
00:25:12,895 --> 00:25:15,993
Okay. Well...
So, it's just a half shift.

314
00:25:16,094 --> 00:25:18,909
I'll be back in four hours, and
we'll go do something fun, okay?

315
00:25:19,008 --> 00:25:20,382
Okay.

316
00:25:47,934 --> 00:25:51,250
- This in an eight and a half.
- Nothing for Sylvie?

317
00:25:51,357 --> 00:25:52,819
No.

318
00:26:10,204 --> 00:26:12,027
We don't have the coral
in an eight and a half.

319
00:26:12,124 --> 00:26:14,841
So I brought the taupe
and the black.

320
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:19,796
And this is a similar style
in ivory with a strap.

321
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,624
Oh, I don't want the strap.

322
00:26:21,725 --> 00:26:24,375
I didn't think you would.
I just wanted you to see it.

323
00:26:24,477 --> 00:26:26,811
Yeah, I would just
feel silly with the strap.

324
00:26:26,908 --> 00:26:28,731
I'm a grown woman.

325
00:26:28,829 --> 00:26:31,131
Well, sure. But I'm
contractually obligated...

326
00:26:31,229 --> 00:26:33,083
to at least try to sell you shoes.

327
00:26:37,788 --> 00:26:41,432
How are the boys?
Are you guys all settled in there?

328
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:46,163
My boys are great.
They're great at being boys.

329
00:26:46,269 --> 00:26:47,927
Kids are so adaptable.

330
00:26:48,028 --> 00:26:50,298
- Am I adaptable?
- Yes.

331
00:26:51,388 --> 00:26:53,493
Yes, well...

332
00:26:53,595 --> 00:26:58,167
they have absolutely no control
over their own lives, so...

333
00:26:59,388 --> 00:27:01,908
But if things were reversed...

334
00:27:02,012 --> 00:27:03,922
you know,
like that movie Freaky Friday...

335
00:27:04,028 --> 00:27:08,087
you can be sure Pam and I would be sent
to our rooms for all our fighting.

336
00:27:08,189 --> 00:27:10,609
Yes, they would give us a time-out...

337
00:27:10,716 --> 00:27:15,287
and tell us we could not come out until we
had really thought about what we had done.

338
00:27:17,532 --> 00:27:19,058
What have we done?

339
00:27:21,724 --> 00:27:24,952
But... there are no time-outs.

340
00:27:26,363 --> 00:27:29,528
There's not enough time
for time-out.

341
00:27:31,484 --> 00:27:35,128
Is the sale just for clothes,
or is it for other things too?

342
00:27:35,228 --> 00:27:37,170
It's a storewide sale.

343
00:27:37,275 --> 00:27:39,283
Fifteen minutes, Sylvie.

344
00:27:40,954 --> 00:27:42,809
How do they feel?

345
00:27:56,634 --> 00:27:58,521
Where are the Braun
handheld blenders...

346
00:27:58,618 --> 00:28:00,724
that were advertised
in the Sunday supplement?

347
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:11,895
- Is it a classic instrument?
- What?

348
00:28:11,993 --> 00:28:15,255
Is it timeless, or is it likely
to go out of style in the next 20 years?

349
00:28:15,352 --> 00:28:18,931
I would say it's a new classic.
But 20 years is a long time.

350
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:22,862
I think everything's gonna be
computerized in 20 years.

351
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,687
- Soup won't be computerized.
- Why not?

352
00:28:25,785 --> 00:28:27,476
It's a liquid.

353
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:35,151
Dude, did you just give her
the family discount?

354
00:28:35,257 --> 00:28:38,672
Yeah. She's my neighbor.
I'm trying to work on my karma.

355
00:28:38,778 --> 00:28:40,915
- Do you know what karma means?
- Yeah.

356
00:28:41,016 --> 00:28:43,056
It means that she owes me one.

357
00:28:51,161 --> 00:28:52,983
<i>I love you.</i>

358
00:29:00,793 --> 00:29:03,695
I'm not following you.
My car's parked over there.

359
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,550
- In Smart Park?
- No, on Front Street.

360
00:29:06,649 --> 00:29:08,820
Oh, I parked in Smart Park.

361
00:29:10,808 --> 00:29:15,412
So, at the end of the next block
we'll separate. At Tyrone Street.

362
00:29:15,513 --> 00:29:18,447
Yeah, the "Ice Land" sign is halfway.

363
00:29:18,552 --> 00:29:22,097
It's the halfway... point.

364
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,262
Ice Land is...

365
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:29,175
It's kind of like that point
in a relationship, you know...

366
00:29:29,272 --> 00:29:33,046
where you suddenly realize
it's not gonna last forever.

367
00:29:33,145 --> 00:29:35,566
You know, you can
see the end in sight.

368
00:29:36,536 --> 00:29:37,998
Tyrone Street.

369
00:29:38,104 --> 00:29:40,854
Yeah, but we're not even there yet.

370
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:46,356
We're still at the good part.
We're not even sick of each other yet.

371
00:29:46,455 --> 00:29:48,876
I'm not sick of you at all.

372
00:29:48,983 --> 00:29:52,245
And wow! It's been a good
like six months, right?

373
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:55,062
What? Six months?

374
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:57,712
Then the Ice Land sign
is like eight months?

375
00:29:57,814 --> 00:29:59,756
You think we'd only last
a year and a half?

376
00:29:59,862 --> 00:30:02,448
I don't know. I don't
want to be presumptuous.

377
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:05,333
- I don't know if you're married or what.
- I'm not.

378
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:09,970
Well, I'm separated.
We separated last month.

379
00:30:12,406 --> 00:30:14,348
I was thinking...

380
00:30:14,454 --> 00:30:16,460
that Tyrone...

381
00:30:16,566 --> 00:30:18,737
was like 20 years away at least.

382
00:30:18,837 --> 00:30:20,048
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

383
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:23,859
Okay. Well, actually
I was thinking...

384
00:30:23,958 --> 00:30:27,056
Tyrone is, like,
when we die of old age.

385
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:30,541
And this is, like, our whole life
together, this block.

386
00:30:30,646 --> 00:30:32,621
See, that's perfect.

387
00:30:32,725 --> 00:30:35,092
- Let's do it that way.
- Okay.

388
00:30:59,061 --> 00:31:02,639
Well, guess it can't be avoided.
Everyone dies.

389
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,650
I could walk you to your car.

390
00:31:04,757 --> 00:31:06,698
Maybe we should just be glad...

391
00:31:06,805 --> 00:31:10,547
that we lived this long,
good life together.

392
00:31:10,645 --> 00:31:13,874
You know, it's so much more
than most people ever get to have.

393
00:31:13,973 --> 00:31:14,899
- Okay.
- Okay.

394
00:31:19,445 --> 00:31:22,608
- Well, don't be afraid.
- Okay.

395
00:31:25,141 --> 00:31:28,523
- Here we go.
- Here we go.

396
00:32:02,227 --> 00:32:04,050
Richard! Hi.

397
00:32:05,587 --> 00:32:08,882
Hi. I thought your car
was over here.

398
00:32:08,979 --> 00:32:12,524
It is. It's down there.
You could give me a ride to it.

399
00:32:12,626 --> 00:32:15,441
Doesn't that break
the rules of the thing?

400
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:17,743
This can be like the afterlife.

401
00:32:20,818 --> 00:32:24,397
You know,
like we're angels or something?

402
00:32:24,498 --> 00:32:25,643
Cute.

403
00:32:31,123 --> 00:32:33,162
What are you doing in my car?

404
00:32:34,802 --> 00:32:38,348
No, I don't know you, and you certainly
don't know anything about me.

405
00:32:38,450 --> 00:32:40,272
I mean, what if I'm a killer
of children?

406
00:32:42,035 --> 00:32:46,125
Yeah. Well, that would put a damper
on things, wouldn't it?

407
00:32:46,226 --> 00:32:49,935
See, you're acting like
I'm just this regular man.

408
00:32:51,794 --> 00:32:55,535
Like a man in a book
who the woman in the book meets.

409
00:32:55,634 --> 00:32:57,837
I'm not doing that.

410
00:32:59,122 --> 00:33:02,318
Did I just invite myself into your car?
Is that what I just did?

411
00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:03,945
- Well, I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry.

412
00:33:04,050 --> 00:33:06,919
- I'm sorry.
- You should be.

413
00:33:07,025 --> 00:33:10,920
Good. Terrific.
Can you get out of my car now?

414
00:33:14,642 --> 00:33:16,583
Okay.

415
00:33:18,417 --> 00:33:19,758
Okay.

416
00:34:00,687 --> 00:34:03,687
- Did you bring back my photo?
- Oh, no.

417
00:34:03,792 --> 00:34:07,207
I'm not done with it yet.
I'm still in the brainstorming stage.

418
00:34:07,311 --> 00:34:09,678
Well, if you get stuck,
you should enlist Michael.

419
00:34:09,776 --> 00:34:13,072
He's got creativity
just rolling off of him.

420
00:34:13,168 --> 00:34:16,200
Yeah, I always work alone.
I'm a solo artist.

421
00:34:16,303 --> 00:34:19,881
Of course.
She's still brainstorming.

422
00:34:19,983 --> 00:34:24,260
Yeah. It's like this
complicated process that...

423
00:34:26,927 --> 00:34:30,757
So, tell Ellen about the shoe guy.
Did you go back to the store?

424
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:35,271
Yeah. And turns out
he's a killer of children.

425
00:34:38,831 --> 00:34:40,740
So, oh, well.

426
00:34:55,982 --> 00:34:59,561
What? Why does he say
"the tall one"?

427
00:34:59,662 --> 00:35:03,525
- Because he wants me to do it.
- He's crazy.

428
00:35:03,631 --> 00:35:07,046
You'd leave teeth marks all over it.
You'd choke on it.

429
00:35:08,142 --> 00:35:10,728
He could see that I have
a sensuous mouth.

430
00:35:12,430 --> 00:35:15,462
This is crazy. Someone
should call in the authorities.

431
00:35:15,566 --> 00:35:18,118
Obviously, I would do it better.

432
00:35:18,222 --> 00:35:21,037
We need an impartial authority.

433
00:35:22,285 --> 00:35:25,285
Hey, Peter!
Peter Swersey.

434
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:34,888
We are going to give you
a "jimmy ha-ha."

435
00:35:36,429 --> 00:35:38,764
- Do you know what that is?
- Yeah.

436
00:35:38,862 --> 00:35:40,716
No, you don't.
'Cause I just made it up.

437
00:35:40,814 --> 00:35:43,116
Don't you want
a warm, wet jimmy ha-ha?

438
00:35:43,214 --> 00:35:44,555
No.

439
00:35:45,677 --> 00:35:47,716
You live there? Cool.

440
00:35:47,821 --> 00:35:50,309
I'm gonna live in an apartment.
Next year, maybe.

441
00:35:50,413 --> 00:35:52,748
- Yeah, right.
- I am.

442
00:35:52,845 --> 00:35:55,693
My sister's gonna get a loft apartment,
and she said I could live with her.

443
00:35:55,789 --> 00:35:58,691
She won't even let you
sit in her car.

444
00:36:00,235 --> 00:36:03,619
- Can we come in?
- Yeah, can we come in? We'll be good.

445
00:36:09,452 --> 00:36:10,946
Go eat it outside, Robby.

446
00:36:14,987 --> 00:36:18,249
Okay! I just need to
put on my jacket.

447
00:36:47,722 --> 00:36:50,210
- Can we see your parents' room?
- My parents are separated.

448
00:36:50,314 --> 00:36:53,031
My dad sleeps there.
He'll be home, like, any second.

449
00:36:54,475 --> 00:36:58,337
We're each going to do it, and you
have to tell us what the difference is.

450
00:36:58,442 --> 00:37:01,607
Like, how it feels different,
when she does it from when I do it.

451
00:37:01,708 --> 00:37:04,228
Exactly.
Thank you, Rebecca.

452
00:37:04,332 --> 00:37:05,826
You're welcome, Heather.

453
00:37:05,931 --> 00:37:09,280
- But first we need a towel and...
- And a washcloth.

454
00:37:09,387 --> 00:37:12,104
Right. A wet washcloth
and a dry washcloth.

455
00:37:12,203 --> 00:37:14,821
And something sweet,
like a cookie or a piece of candy.

456
00:37:14,923 --> 00:37:18,239
- And a CD player.
- And a Cody Chesnutt CD.

457
00:37:18,346 --> 00:37:19,720
I don't have that CD.

458
00:37:20,970 --> 00:37:25,193
Uh-oh. That's our favorite music.
So I guess we can't do it.

459
00:37:26,762 --> 00:37:29,032
Oh, but look.

460
00:37:30,443 --> 00:37:33,126
- I have it.
- Go get the stuff.

461
00:37:33,227 --> 00:37:36,325
Don't forget the towel,
the washcloths or the cookie.

462
00:37:36,426 --> 00:37:37,767
- Or candy.
- Or candy.

463
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,906
- Ready?
- Yeah.

464
00:38:25,096 --> 00:38:27,005
- Hey. Ready to do this?
- I am.

465
00:38:27,112 --> 00:38:28,060
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

466
00:38:28,167 --> 00:38:30,175
- Okay.
- Yeah, we're good.

467
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:37,216
Okay, here are the rules.

468
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,833
You have to keep this pillow
on your face. You can't watch us.

469
00:38:40,937 --> 00:38:43,620
- Okay.
- You can't touch us.

470
00:38:43,721 --> 00:38:46,209
You can't touch our heads.
And we're not going to touch each other.

471
00:38:46,311 --> 00:38:49,345
And you have to tell us
when you're going to "scooch."

472
00:38:49,447 --> 00:38:52,578
- Okay.
- So, take off your pants.

473
00:39:04,743 --> 00:39:07,590
Okay, I'm going to wash it.
So put the pillow on now.

474
00:39:17,222 --> 00:39:19,459
Now person number one
is going to go.

475
00:39:19,558 --> 00:39:21,860
Might be me.
Might be Rebecca.

476
00:39:51,014 --> 00:39:54,495
- Okay, you go.
- I don't want your cooties. Wipe it off.

477
00:40:04,102 --> 00:40:08,063
Okay. Person number two...
citizen two is beginning now.

478
00:40:17,541 --> 00:40:19,297
Get away.

479
00:40:27,204 --> 00:40:29,888
- Can I have the washcloth?
- The wet one or the dry one?

480
00:40:29,988 --> 00:40:31,712
The dry one.

481
00:40:43,813 --> 00:40:46,180
So, what was the difference?

482
00:40:47,302 --> 00:40:51,424
Yeah, who was better...
number one or number two?

483
00:40:54,372 --> 00:40:56,991
You were exactly the same.
I couldn't tell the difference.

484
00:41:08,388 --> 00:41:10,461
<i>As far as everything goes
with you, Jim...</i>

485
00:41:10,564 --> 00:41:13,215
Are you guys all packed
for your mom's?

486
00:41:13,317 --> 00:41:15,291
Yeah.

487
00:41:29,828 --> 00:41:32,249
- What's that?
- Dave planted it.

488
00:41:35,492 --> 00:41:37,380
What a romantic guy.

489
00:41:50,403 --> 00:41:52,346
I'm in here. Come in.

490
00:41:55,874 --> 00:41:57,784
Okay. Well, I'm off.

491
00:41:57,891 --> 00:41:59,865
I'm just brushing my teeth.

492
00:42:16,418 --> 00:42:18,110
God, I used to
hate that nightgown.

493
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:21,820
Other people have to look at it,
but they can't read it.

494
00:42:21,921 --> 00:42:24,093
That's the point.

495
00:42:24,193 --> 00:42:26,168
Self-affirming.

496
00:42:26,274 --> 00:42:29,143
Well, so you really need
that written on your chest?

497
00:42:29,250 --> 00:42:31,583
You don't already know it?

498
00:42:31,682 --> 00:42:34,267
No, I don't already know
I'm a precious, wondrous...

499
00:42:34,368 --> 00:42:36,889
special, unique, divine,
rare, valuable, whole...

500
00:42:36,993 --> 00:42:40,474
sacred, total, complete, entitled,
worthy and deserving person.

501
00:42:40,578 --> 00:42:41,756
I don't know that.

502
00:44:30,270 --> 00:44:32,889
Menswear is the other
side of the escalator.

503
00:44:34,270 --> 00:44:36,408
- Over here?
- Yeah.

504
00:44:45,950 --> 00:44:46,964
Hi.

505
00:44:49,471 --> 00:44:50,964
Do you have any glue?

506
00:44:52,829 --> 00:44:56,091
- Oh, we have Shoe Goo.
- Yeah, that might work.

507
00:45:24,925 --> 00:45:28,602
We have to hold this
for one to two minutes.

508
00:45:32,445 --> 00:45:35,576
So, how's the separation going?

509
00:45:35,677 --> 00:45:38,394
Or was that temporary?
Maybe even momentary?

510
00:45:38,492 --> 00:45:42,268
No, we're really separated.
But we have two kids.

511
00:45:42,365 --> 00:45:45,594
Okay. How old are they?

512
00:45:45,693 --> 00:45:49,141
It's a real madhouse in here.
It's 'cause of the sale we're having.

513
00:45:49,245 --> 00:45:51,927
Well, go if you need to go.

514
00:45:57,916 --> 00:45:59,410
How did you do that?

515
00:46:00,572 --> 00:46:04,914
Oh, well, do you want
the long version or the short version?

516
00:46:05,020 --> 00:46:06,841
The long one.

517
00:46:08,859 --> 00:46:11,859
I was trying to save my life,
and it didn't work.

518
00:46:13,340 --> 00:46:14,769
What's the short one?

519
00:46:14,875 --> 00:46:16,664
I burned it.

520
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:19,863
And when do you get to take that off?

521
00:46:19,963 --> 00:46:24,086
I don't know.
I think when it stops hurting.

522
00:46:24,187 --> 00:46:28,213
Let's give it another 15 seconds.

523
00:46:38,331 --> 00:46:43,448
Do you want to sit down... together
sometime, like with coffee or something?

524
00:46:43,547 --> 00:46:45,074
Yeah.

525
00:47:02,234 --> 00:47:06,424
Well, if you ever feel too old to drive,
just call that number.

526
00:47:26,650 --> 00:47:28,984
<i>I can't hear you.!</i>

527
00:47:29,080 --> 00:47:30,500
Is she of color?

528
00:47:30,501 --> 00:47:31,863
<i>And do you love me?</i>

529
00:47:31,961 --> 00:47:34,513
No. But she's a woman.

530
00:47:34,617 --> 00:47:37,039
<i>Even though I am
sometimes irritating?</i>

531
00:47:38,713 --> 00:47:40,568
<i>And a little bit selfish.!</i>

532
00:47:40,665 --> 00:47:42,127
Oh, her.

533
00:47:42,233 --> 00:47:46,488
<i>Even when I forget to ask you
how your day was?</i>

534
00:47:46,585 --> 00:47:50,447
Yeah, okay. Didn't we already
show a local person this year?

535
00:47:50,554 --> 00:47:53,487
I don't think she's ready.
Let's go to slides.

536
00:47:53,592 --> 00:47:55,415
<i>I really do love you...</i>

537
00:47:56,793 --> 00:47:59,510
All right, what we need
to ask ourselves...

538
00:47:59,608 --> 00:48:02,129
about each one of these is:

539
00:48:02,233 --> 00:48:06,259
Could this have been made
in any era, or only now?

540
00:48:06,361 --> 00:48:09,327
- Are you listening?
- Yeah.

541
00:48:09,432 --> 00:48:15,095
Okay, what does this tell us
about digital culture?

542
00:48:19,384 --> 00:48:23,125
I don't think this tells us
anything about digital culture.

543
00:48:23,223 --> 00:48:24,630
I think you're right.

544
00:48:28,055 --> 00:48:30,738
Let me guess.
This one's about AIDS.

545
00:48:34,615 --> 00:48:38,576
Yeah, it's not really on the theme, right?

546
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,850
And we already have photography.

547
00:48:40,951 --> 00:48:43,766
You know, we have
those photos and e-mails.

548
00:48:43,862 --> 00:48:47,408
E-mail wouldn't even exist
if it weren't for AIDS.

549
00:48:47,511 --> 00:48:51,505
Fear of contamination.
Fear of bodily fluids.

550
00:48:52,982 --> 00:48:55,601
I need a break.
Let's take a break.

551
00:51:54,674 --> 00:51:57,674
Okay. Okay, I'll get him.
Richard.

552
00:51:57,777 --> 00:52:00,265
Why don't you walk around
in those and see how they feel.

553
00:52:00,370 --> 00:52:03,403
- It's Peter.
- Hello?

554
00:52:03,505 --> 00:52:06,801
Oh, no. Really?
Well, did you call your mom?

555
00:52:06,898 --> 00:52:09,233
Oh, right. Damn.

556
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:13,104
Well, can you make it through the day,
Petey? Are you barfing?

557
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:15,535
Okay. Okay, let's see here.

558
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:18,350
I don't get off until 6:00, and we
are just slammed here. It's a sale day.

559
00:52:18,448 --> 00:52:20,904
But don't worry.
Someone will come and get you.

560
00:52:21,009 --> 00:52:24,489
This is why we have neighbors.
We're part of a community, Peter.

561
00:52:59,504 --> 00:53:02,439
Does your mom make you do that?

562
00:53:02,544 --> 00:53:04,845
No, this is my own towel.

563
00:53:04,944 --> 00:53:08,773
I bought it with my own money.
I have the whole set.

564
00:53:09,808 --> 00:53:12,197
See, this is the bath sheet...

565
00:53:12,303 --> 00:53:14,508
and this is the hand towel...

566
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:16,201
and this is the washcloth.

567
00:53:16,304 --> 00:53:18,408
- Isn't the washcloth cute?
- Yeah.

568
00:53:19,408 --> 00:53:22,026
When they hang on the rack,
they go like this.

569
00:53:24,048 --> 00:53:25,640
I only have one set...

570
00:53:25,743 --> 00:53:29,038
but I think I'm going to get
the other two for Christmas.

571
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:31,852
What is all that stuff?

572
00:53:33,166 --> 00:53:37,061
When I get married, all this stuff will
belong to my husband and my daughter.

573
00:53:37,167 --> 00:53:39,403
Everything I have here
will be theirs.

574
00:53:39,503 --> 00:53:42,732
All of it. It's my dowry.

575
00:53:44,591 --> 00:53:48,585
This is called a hope chest.
Or trousseau in French.

576
00:54:10,638 --> 00:54:12,547
So Peter was barfing?

577
00:54:12,653 --> 00:54:14,792
I asked the neighbor
woman to go get him.

578
00:54:14,894 --> 00:54:18,440
It's like how they say it takes
a village to raise a child.

579
00:54:18,542 --> 00:54:20,483
If you'll excuse me,
this is a private call.

580
00:54:24,653 --> 00:54:26,856
So Robby's old enough
to walk home alone?

581
00:54:29,645 --> 00:54:31,052
Shit lords!

582
00:54:42,221 --> 00:54:44,196
There's no answer.

583
00:54:46,380 --> 00:54:49,130
Robby loves to answer the phone.
If he was there, he'd be answering it.

584
00:54:51,821 --> 00:54:54,723
Maybe Peter went out
looking for Robby.

585
00:54:54,829 --> 00:54:57,763
Yeah, see, this is why you don't
want a village raising your kid...

586
00:54:57,868 --> 00:54:59,690
because there's sketchy
parts of the village...

587
00:54:59,788 --> 00:55:04,163
and some of the villagers
are junkies and child molesters.

588
00:55:04,268 --> 00:55:07,748
I gotta go. Tell Sven that
Robby's missing and I had to go.

589
00:55:25,964 --> 00:55:27,971
<i>Thanks for calling.</i>

590
00:55:28,076 --> 00:55:33,672
<i>For customer service or furniture
or mattress delivery inquiries, press 4.</i>

591
00:55:33,771 --> 00:55:36,138
<i>For bridal registry, press 6.</i>

592
00:55:44,268 --> 00:55:46,090
- Mann res...
- Is Robby here?

593
00:55:46,188 --> 00:55:49,188
- Mann residence. May I help you?
- Is Robby here?

594
00:55:49,292 --> 00:55:52,161
No. If you didn't know me,
would you think I was really this tall...

595
00:55:52,268 --> 00:55:54,601
or would you think I was
standing on something?

596
00:56:11,084 --> 00:56:13,089
You're here. Jesus Christ!

597
00:56:13,194 --> 00:56:15,496
- Why didn't you guys answer the phone?
- I was online.

598
00:56:15,595 --> 00:56:18,758
Well, no more Internet when I'm not here.
I have to be able to call you.

599
00:56:18,858 --> 00:56:21,030
Maybe you should buy
us cell phones.

600
00:56:21,130 --> 00:56:24,545
No. Just stay off the fucking computer
when I'm not here!

601
00:56:24,650 --> 00:56:27,399
You can't make us stay off
the computer if you're not here.

602
00:56:27,498 --> 00:56:30,280
- You won't be here to keep us off it!
- It's for safety!

603
00:56:30,378 --> 00:56:33,345
- How did you get home?
- I walked.

604
00:57:00,201 --> 00:57:04,130
What is your dad watching?
It looks like Nickelodeon.

605
00:57:04,233 --> 00:57:07,549
- Don't look at my dad.
- Sorry.

606
00:57:09,481 --> 00:57:13,671
If he puts up another sign,
I think we should go up there.

607
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:21,282
I mean, what else can happen?
Just more signs? Signs forever?

608
00:57:22,985 --> 00:57:27,524
I always thought I'd lose it with someone
who was my boyfriend or something.

609
00:57:29,671 --> 00:57:31,614
But this is better...

610
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:34,754
'cause it won't matter if we mess up.

611
00:57:34,856 --> 00:57:37,093
And we'll be together.

612
00:58:15,398 --> 00:58:18,398
<i>But I'm trying to change.!</i>

613
00:58:18,502 --> 00:58:19,877
<i>All right.</i>

614
00:58:19,975 --> 00:58:25,060
<i>This song is for you,
and, yes, it is a love song.</i>

615
00:58:30,790 --> 00:58:32,449
<i>Hi, Nancy Herrington.</i>

616
00:58:33,637 --> 00:58:38,624
<i>So this morning, if you remember,
you had asked me to send you my work.</i>

617
00:58:38,726 --> 00:58:42,109
<i>And that was it, what you just
watched. Did you love it?</i>

618
00:58:42,215 --> 00:58:44,353
<i>I'm just kidding.</i>

619
00:58:44,453 --> 00:58:48,348
<i>I can see why you don't do this
face to face. It can be very awkward.</i>

620
00:58:50,055 --> 00:58:52,029
<i>Hi.</i>

621
00:58:52,134 --> 00:58:53,890
<i>And then you'd say...</i>

622
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:57,504
<i>"Hi. How was your day?"</i>

623
00:58:57,606 --> 00:59:02,275
<i>Oh, me? I had a really
weird day, actually.</i>

624
00:59:02,374 --> 00:59:05,407
<i>And now I'm here...</i>

625
00:59:05,510 --> 00:59:07,965
<i>alone in my apartment.</i>

626
00:59:09,413 --> 00:59:12,609
<i>You're probably in your big house...</i>

627
00:59:12,709 --> 00:59:17,282
<i>with your family...
and your dog.</i>

628
00:59:17,382 --> 00:59:20,033
<i>And probably your dog
has a family too.</i>

629
00:59:20,134 --> 00:59:23,548
<i>You're probably all gathered
around the fire singing carols...</i>

630
00:59:23,654 --> 00:59:25,411
<i>even though it isn't Christmas.</i>

631
00:59:25,510 --> 00:59:27,168
<i>Just for fun.</i>

632
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:32,385
<i>You will never, ever see this...</i>

633
00:59:32,485 --> 00:59:36,347
<i>because you'll never watch
this far on the tape.</i>

634
00:59:36,453 --> 00:59:39,868
<i>You'll probably never
even watch the tape, will you?</i>

635
00:59:41,508 --> 00:59:43,996
<i>I could do anything right now.</i>

636
00:59:54,309 --> 00:59:56,316
<i>If you are watching this...</i>

637
00:59:56,421 --> 01:00:01,570
<i>then just call this number, okay?</i>

638
01:00:01,668 --> 01:00:05,149
<i>Just call this number,
the number you see on your screen...</i>

639
01:00:05,252 --> 01:00:08,929
<i>and say "macaroni."</i>

640
01:00:09,028 --> 01:00:11,416
<i>Okay? That's all you have to do.</i>

641
01:00:12,484 --> 01:00:16,193
<i>Just "macaroni" and hang up.
No questions asked.</i>

642
01:00:25,572 --> 01:00:28,321
I thought we'd have
breakfast for dinner.

643
01:00:28,420 --> 01:00:32,925
And then maybe sometime
we'll have dinner for breakfast.

644
01:00:33,923 --> 01:00:36,160
Just to mix things up a little.

645
01:00:36,258 --> 01:00:39,008
But there's still
ice cream for dessert.

646
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:46,808
It's fine with me if you guys want
to continue this silent treatment.

647
01:00:46,916 --> 01:00:49,304
It's like a Zen retreat for me.

648
01:00:59,203 --> 01:01:02,518
- Can I see it?
- I didn't use the book. I made it up.

649
01:01:04,547 --> 01:01:08,288
- What is it?
- It's people seen from above.

650
01:01:09,058 --> 01:01:11,000
From the sky.

651
01:01:11,106 --> 01:01:13,146
See, these are people walking.

652
01:01:15,074 --> 01:01:17,659
That's a person lying down.

653
01:01:17,762 --> 01:01:20,631
And that's a person standing up
next to a person lying down.

654
01:01:21,858 --> 01:01:24,225
This is me...

655
01:01:24,322 --> 01:01:26,209
and you...

656
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:28,924
and everyone we know.

657
01:01:31,330 --> 01:01:33,020
Where is Dad?

658
01:01:43,554 --> 01:01:44,961
r

659
01:01:47,138 --> 01:01:48,829
i

660
01:01:50,850 --> 01:01:52,443
n

661
01:01:54,241 --> 01:01:57,886
Come on. Come on.

662
01:01:57,986 --> 01:01:59,513
g

663
01:02:05,057 --> 01:02:09,279
We have a whole life
to live together, you fucker!

664
01:02:11,233 --> 01:02:14,299
But it can't start until you call.

665
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,717
- Eldercab.
- Macaroni.

666
01:02:29,344 --> 01:02:33,499
This can't be a regular thing. Tell them
that you can't come in before 9:00.

667
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:35,934
It's not a regular thing. Last week
I had to leave early one day...

668
01:02:36,031 --> 01:02:39,413
Why did you have to leave early?
Is everything okay?

669
01:02:40,831 --> 01:02:43,701
Honey, go back to bed.
Was it the boys?

670
01:02:43,808 --> 01:02:47,320
No. Jesus! I have
a personal life, you know.

671
01:02:47,423 --> 01:02:49,496
Oh, okay.

672
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,276
So I'll take them for longer next week.
But you have 'em this whole week...

673
01:02:53,376 --> 01:02:56,343
because Dave and I are going
to the coast until Saturday, okay?

674
01:02:57,791 --> 01:03:00,508
- Is that not okay?
- It is, but I might have a date.

675
01:03:02,367 --> 01:03:03,959
Well, what do you want me to do?

676
01:03:04,062 --> 01:03:08,121
Should I cancel our trip so you can go
on the date you might have?

677
01:03:08,223 --> 01:03:10,328
No, obviously you should go.

678
01:03:10,430 --> 01:03:13,278
- What's that sound?
- I don't know, Rob.

679
01:03:13,375 --> 01:03:15,546
- You should be in bed.
- Mom?

680
01:03:15,647 --> 01:03:18,778
That always happens at this time.
You just were never up this early.

681
01:03:18,878 --> 01:03:23,102
It's the lights, Robby.
See these street lights?

682
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:27,574
They're run by a big computer
that tells them when to go on and off.

683
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:29,981
That's what that sound is.

684
01:03:34,590 --> 01:03:37,819
So, for the purpose of this role-play,
Shamus is holding a grenade.

685
01:03:37,918 --> 01:03:41,715
The juice is a grenade, so the worst thing
we can do is act afraid.

686
01:03:41,822 --> 01:03:45,881
Because Shamus is already scared,
and he's taking his cues from us.

687
01:03:45,981 --> 01:03:49,016
We will want to exit
in an orderly fashion...

688
01:03:49,118 --> 01:03:50,940
telling Shamus with our actions...

689
01:03:51,038 --> 01:03:54,071
that he cannot get our attention
in this inappropriate manner.

690
01:04:12,606 --> 01:04:16,152
Hey. Hi.

691
01:04:18,332 --> 01:04:22,772
So, do you have anything new in the chest?
You know, the hope chest?

692
01:04:22,876 --> 01:04:25,593
- What's the hope chest?
- It's... nothing.

693
01:04:27,645 --> 01:04:30,133
I don't know,
what you're talking about.

694
01:04:39,932 --> 01:04:41,557
Ellen broke up with me.

695
01:04:41,659 --> 01:04:44,310
What? Why?

696
01:04:44,412 --> 01:04:47,314
She thinks she's
gonna die this week.

697
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:51,959
No. Out of everyone at Saint Tod,
she is the least likely person to die.

698
01:04:52,060 --> 01:04:57,112
Well, she's usually right.
She's been right about everyone else.

699
01:04:57,213 --> 01:05:00,595
I lived a whole life with a woman
I didn't even really like.

700
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:03,546
We traveled
all over the world together.

701
01:05:04,954 --> 01:05:08,151
And Ellen and I,
never even left the grounds.

702
01:05:08,251 --> 01:05:11,382
Well, actually I took you
to the IMAX that one time.

703
01:05:11,483 --> 01:05:15,738
Yeah, but I wanted to take her
to the Mayan ruins in Guatemala.

704
01:05:15,835 --> 01:05:18,618
She really wanted to see those.

705
01:05:18,716 --> 01:05:22,392
Yeah, that just seems weird that
she wouldn't want to be with you...

706
01:05:22,491 --> 01:05:25,305
you know,
if her time was coming.

707
01:05:25,404 --> 01:05:28,753
I've long since stopped
trying to make people...

708
01:05:28,859 --> 01:05:31,031
do things they don't want to do.

709
01:05:32,411 --> 01:05:37,145
But she's the love of your life.
You're just gonna let her go?

710
01:05:37,946 --> 01:05:42,354
No. She's just... going.

711
01:05:58,651 --> 01:06:01,269
<i>I can't get you out of my mind.</i>

712
01:06:01,371 --> 01:06:03,858
<i>You're everything I've ever wanted.</i>

713
01:06:03,962 --> 01:06:07,923
<i>Wild dogs couldn't
drag me away from you.</i>

714
01:06:12,058 --> 01:06:14,065
Do you realize he's six?

715
01:06:15,675 --> 01:06:19,535
He said he walked down Burnside.
I don't even walk down Burnside alone.

716
01:06:19,641 --> 01:06:22,062
I am totally and
completely in the wrong.

717
01:06:27,737 --> 01:06:30,290
I'll call you.
When's a good time?

718
01:06:34,328 --> 01:06:37,295
I thought you might be interested
in buying this talking picture frame.

719
01:06:37,401 --> 01:06:40,434
- I love you.
- Yeah, it's really convenient.

720
01:06:40,537 --> 01:06:43,603
You can just
carry it around with you.

721
01:06:43,704 --> 01:06:47,828
And the next time you need to say "I love you,"
you can just press the button.

722
01:06:48,761 --> 01:06:49,939
Yeah.

723
01:06:50,936 --> 01:06:54,352
Could save you
a lot of energy, you know?

724
01:06:54,456 --> 01:06:58,199
But, then, if you're planning
on saying "I love you" a lot...

725
01:06:58,297 --> 01:07:00,915
you might have to change
the batteries.

726
01:07:02,201 --> 01:07:05,047
They're double-A's.
Do you think you can handle that?

727
01:07:05,144 --> 01:07:07,479
- Yeah.
- Good luck.

728
01:07:11,800 --> 01:07:13,905
Fuck!

729
01:07:14,007 --> 01:07:16,823
Fuck you! Fuck me!

730
01:07:16,921 --> 01:07:19,670
Fuck old people!
Fuck children!

731
01:07:19,768 --> 01:07:21,590
Fuck peace!

732
01:07:28,056 --> 01:07:30,096
Fuck.

733
01:09:32,244 --> 01:09:36,521
I'm taking off the bandage now,
if anyone wants to see.

734
01:09:51,252 --> 01:09:53,107
It's so sensitive.

735
01:09:56,596 --> 01:09:59,530
It needs air.
It needs to do some living.

736
01:09:59,636 --> 01:10:02,221
Let's take my hand for a walk.

737
01:10:06,836 --> 01:10:08,112
Talk to me.

738
01:10:12,596 --> 01:10:15,181
So this is it? This is
the end of our relationship?

739
01:10:15,283 --> 01:10:18,381
That makes me sad.
It really does.

740
01:10:34,771 --> 01:10:37,769
Do you have questions
you wanna ask me?

741
01:10:37,873 --> 01:10:40,656
Do you want advice
from your dad?

742
01:10:40,754 --> 01:10:43,950
Ask me for advice on anything,
anything at all. Anything.

743
01:10:46,449 --> 01:10:48,271
Okay, name a song.
I'll whistle it.

744
01:10:48,369 --> 01:10:51,238
Any song.
Any song that I know.

745
01:10:52,785 --> 01:10:54,192
"Every Stone Shall Cry."

746
01:10:54,290 --> 01:10:55,980
- What?
- It's a hymn.

747
01:10:57,586 --> 01:11:00,401
A hymn?
How do you know a hymn?

748
01:11:00,497 --> 01:11:02,669
We learned it at school.

749
01:11:08,274 --> 01:11:09,899
All right, let's hear it.

750
01:11:10,001 --> 01:11:13,263
<i>A stable lamp is lighted</i>

751
01:11:13,362 --> 01:11:16,809
<i>Whose glow shall wake the sky</i>

752
01:11:16,913 --> 01:11:20,656
<i>The stars shall bend their voices</i>

753
01:11:20,754 --> 01:11:27,461
<i>And every stone shall cry
And every stone shall cry</i>

754
01:11:27,569 --> 01:11:31,847
<i>In praises of the child</i>

755
01:11:31,953 --> 01:11:35,434
<i>By whose descent among us</i>

756
01:11:35,537 --> 01:11:39,279
<i>The worlds are reconciled</i>

757
01:12:09,712 --> 01:12:11,021
Come in.

758
01:12:16,240 --> 01:12:18,062
What's that?

759
01:12:18,159 --> 01:12:20,680
It's something for the hope chest.

760
01:12:26,446 --> 01:12:28,454
It's for your daughter.

761
01:12:38,638 --> 01:12:40,940
So you've thought about
where you'll put everything?

762
01:12:41,038 --> 01:12:43,459
Like the interior design?

763
01:12:43,566 --> 01:12:47,047
Yes. Yes, I have, Peter.

764
01:12:57,390 --> 01:12:59,333
If this was the kitchen...

765
01:12:59,438 --> 01:13:03,147
I'd like there to be a little nook
right over there by the window.

766
01:13:03,246 --> 01:13:05,418
Like the booth of a restaurant.

767
01:13:06,861 --> 01:13:10,025
And there'd be an island
right where the light is hanging...

768
01:13:10,126 --> 01:13:12,876
and the island
would have the stove in it...

769
01:13:12,974 --> 01:13:16,137
and a countertop on one side
with tall stools under it.

770
01:13:16,238 --> 01:13:18,060
My daughter would sit on a stool...

771
01:13:18,157 --> 01:13:20,841
so I could talk to her while
I was making dinner or lunch.

772
01:13:22,734 --> 01:13:24,588
What would you say to her?

773
01:13:25,965 --> 01:13:28,813
I'd say...

774
01:13:28,909 --> 01:13:32,009
"Hi, baby girl.

775
01:13:32,110 --> 01:13:36,388
You are a precious treasure."

776
01:13:38,093 --> 01:13:41,606
I'd live up there, if I could.

777
01:13:41,709 --> 01:13:43,651
If there wasn't gravity.

778
01:13:45,069 --> 01:13:46,891
Yeah.

779
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:49,377
But if you lived up there...

780
01:13:49,485 --> 01:13:51,525
then all this stuff...

781
01:13:51,629 --> 01:13:54,084
all this stuff in my room...

782
01:13:54,189 --> 01:13:57,418
would fall down on you
and crush you...

783
01:13:57,517 --> 01:13:59,340
and you'd die.

784
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:57,124
Ellen would have been so proud of you.

785
01:17:01,224 --> 01:17:03,842
<i>Isn't it amazing, Ellen?</i>

786
01:17:03,944 --> 01:17:07,555
<i>Yes. I'm so glad
you took me here.</i>

787
01:17:07,656 --> 01:17:11,616
<i>It was a whole civilization.</i>

788
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:18,271
<i>Two Mayan people in love...</i>

789
01:17:18,374 --> 01:17:23,525
<i>probably stood right where
we're standing now and thought...</i>

790
01:17:23,623 --> 01:17:27,333
<i>"Look what we have built together."</i>

791
01:17:28,583 --> 01:17:32,739
<i>And now they're gone,
and so is the city.</i>

792
01:17:34,439 --> 01:17:39,295
<i>And there's just... us.</i>

793
01:17:43,974 --> 01:17:45,916
<i>I am done.</i>

794
01:17:46,022 --> 01:17:47,909
<i>That was great.</i>

795
01:17:59,078 --> 01:18:02,624
- Eldercab.
- Hi.

796
01:18:02,727 --> 01:18:06,339
- I'm feeling too old to drive.
- Yeah?

797
01:18:06,439 --> 01:18:09,885
I didn't think you were going to...
feel that way.

798
01:18:09,989 --> 01:18:13,470
I thought sometime you might want
to come over and meet my sons.

799
01:18:13,574 --> 01:18:16,062
Can we do that right now?

800
01:18:16,166 --> 01:18:18,500
Now as in "now"?

801
01:18:18,598 --> 01:18:20,321
Yeah.

802
01:18:29,573 --> 01:18:33,883
Oh, good. You're here.
You have to clean all this up.

803
01:18:33,989 --> 01:18:36,836
Come on. Come on.
Go. Go. Go.

804
01:18:38,469 --> 01:18:41,883
Put away all this stuff. All this stuff
needs to be put away somewhere.

805
01:18:44,323 --> 01:18:46,974
No. Wait. You're right.
This is better. More kid-like.

806
01:18:47,077 --> 01:18:51,102
Just play. Do whatever you normally do.
Just be kids. That's great.

807
01:19:26,179 --> 01:19:28,732
Is that gonna fit in there?

808
01:19:32,196 --> 01:19:34,235
No, I don't think so.

809
01:19:35,939 --> 01:19:37,696
Maybe you can put it in there.

810
01:19:44,931 --> 01:19:47,865
I guess not. It looked
like it would fit, but I guess not.

811
01:19:49,571 --> 01:19:51,710
Wait. Wait. I know.

812
01:19:58,659 --> 01:20:00,514
Put it under there.

813
01:21:22,880 --> 01:21:24,768
What are you doing that for?

814
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:29,589
I'm just passing the time.
