1
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,076
Don?

2
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:53,846
Don Strachey?

3
00:00:53,953 --> 00:00:55,318
You must be Paul Hale.

4
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:56,753
Yeah.

5
00:00:56,856 --> 00:00:57,584
Gotta tell you, Paul,

6
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,023
I usually meet new
clients in my office.

7
00:01:01,127 --> 00:01:02,492
Sorry, I just...

8
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:04,358
I can't really be
seen going there.

9
00:01:04,464 --> 00:01:06,864
Not now.

10
00:01:06,966 --> 00:01:08,661
I don't know why we couldn't
have just done this

11
00:01:08,768 --> 00:01:10,065
over the phone.

12
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,694
I like to meet
clients face-to-face,

13
00:01:11,805 --> 00:01:13,500
that's how I know
they're legit.

14
00:01:13,606 --> 00:01:15,733
Yeah.

15
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:17,639
Maybe you should tell me
what you're looking for?

16
00:01:20,146 --> 00:01:22,376
I need help.

17
00:01:22,482 --> 00:01:24,382
I need you to track
someone down for me.

18
00:01:24,484 --> 00:01:24,779
Okay.

19
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:25,509
You can do that, right?

20
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:26,585
Sure.

21
00:01:26,686 --> 00:01:28,950
But listen, you gotta keep
this totally secret.

22
00:01:29,055 --> 00:01:30,989
Nobody can know
what you're doing.

23
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,720
Look, maybe you want to tell
me who you're looking for?

24
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,261
I need someone
I can trust.

25
00:01:36,362 --> 00:01:37,090
Can I trust you?

26
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:39,665
Yeah, yeah, you can.

27
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,233
Look, there's a diner
around the corner,

28
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:42,096
why don't
we take a walk...

29
00:01:42,202 --> 00:01:44,397
you and I
can just talk.

30
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:45,334
I can't be seen.

31
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:46,496
Here take it,
take it!

32
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,540
No!

33
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:05,640
No!

34
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:09,482
Stop!

35
00:03:11,558 --> 00:03:13,958
Stop!

36
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,891
We don't have time.

37
00:03:15,995 --> 00:03:17,622
I can think of a thousand
things I'd rather do

38
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:19,357
than go to this event.

39
00:03:19,465 --> 00:03:20,762
We promised.

40
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:21,629
That was just
number three.

41
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:24,532
Wait 'til you see
number 6 and number 7.

42
00:03:24,637 --> 00:03:25,228
We're going.

43
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,202
Both of us.

44
00:03:30,076 --> 00:03:34,035
But I guess we could
be fashionably late.

45
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,944
Tell me about
number 7 again.

46
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:40,284
...and I say we take this
right to their doorsteps.

47
00:03:40,386 --> 00:03:43,116
Camp out at city hall
until we get some answers.

48
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,713
Councilwoman Ferrani's
promised to follow

49
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,189
through with this.

50
00:03:46,292 --> 00:03:47,589
We have to give her time.

51
00:03:47,694 --> 00:03:51,152
Please, I want results,
not empty rhetoric.

52
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:53,232
Especially from someone
the gay community

53
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:56,268
helped put into office.

54
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,667
You agree with
me, don't you?

55
00:03:58,771 --> 00:03:59,533
Do I?

56
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,004
No, you don't.

57
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:04,599
No, I don't,
I definitely do not.

58
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:05,973
Look at that,
evaporated.

59
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:08,339
Nice talking with you.

60
00:04:08,448 --> 00:04:11,713
Likewise I'm sure.

61
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,581
You know darling, I love
you more than my luggage,

62
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,415
but sometimes I wish you
would at least pretend

63
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,113
to be interested in what's
going on in the world.

64
00:04:17,223 --> 00:04:18,690
I am interested
in the world.

65
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,554
I just don't give a rat's
ass about politics.

66
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,093
Maybe that's because you
don't know enough about it.

67
00:04:22,195 --> 00:04:23,492
Maybe it's because
it's boring?

68
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:24,358
Boring?

69
00:04:24,464 --> 00:04:26,193
Honey, politics is the most
exciting cornerstone

70
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,698
of our civilization.

71
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,166
It requires a mastery
of many skills.

72
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,328
Psychology.

73
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:32,369
Persuasion.

74
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:33,530
Communication.

75
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,267
I communicate just fine.

76
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:36,103
Observe.

77
00:04:36,209 --> 00:04:38,234
Barkeep, two martinis.

78
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:39,902
And just dab
the vermouth behind my ears.

79
00:04:42,548 --> 00:04:44,607
Sometimes I swear
you'd be happier

80
00:04:44,717 --> 00:04:46,844
spending the evenings
with a bullet-riddled corpse.

81
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,250
That's not true.

82
00:04:48,354 --> 00:04:49,685
I also like dodging
speeding vehicles

83
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,518
in dark alleys
in the middle of the night.

84
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,648
And speaking of that,
have you heard

85
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:53,885
from your young
Mr. Hale today?

86
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,119
No, I called
and left a message,

87
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,661
but I haven't heard back-

88
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:57,787
hey! You hear that?

89
00:04:57,897 --> 00:04:59,455
Every time a martini
shaker is shaken,

90
00:04:59,565 --> 00:05:00,827
an angel gets his wings.

91
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,897
It's you, right?

92
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:06,198
You're the guy that was
in that advocate article,

93
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,568
the gay detective!

94
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:08,663
Sparky, right?

95
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:09,571
It's Strachey.

96
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:10,438
Donald Strachey.

97
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:12,170
And he's a private
investigator, actually.

98
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,109
How cool is that?

99
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:17,011
You're like the first gay
detective I've ever heard of

100
00:05:17,116 --> 00:05:18,208
I mean, I know a
couple of gay firemen,

101
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:21,810
but a gay detective...
yeah, that's something.

102
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:24,616
Saved by the ring tone.

103
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,753
...uhm, Strachey,

104
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:33,354
yeah, okay.

105
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:34,899
You wanna tell me what
it's about, detective?

106
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,491
Un-huh.

107
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:39,127
Right now?

108
00:05:39,238 --> 00:05:42,833
Okay, see ya,
in twenty minutes.

109
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:43,909
Let me guess.

110
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,103
Bullet riddled corpse?

111
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:48,203
Detective Bailey
says it's an emergency.

112
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:49,872
Sorry, honey.

113
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:52,280
Sparky the gay detective,
off to save the day.

114
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:20,609
Watch your step.

115
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:27,915
You always wear formal attire
to crime scenes, Strachey?

116
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,487
Trying to upgrade
my image.

117
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:32,451
Can I see him?

118
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:38,219
Paul Hale, shit.

119
00:06:38,331 --> 00:06:40,162
You know him?

120
00:06:40,266 --> 00:06:41,233
What happened?

121
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,825
He had a stroke.

122
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:44,868
A stroke?

123
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,370
He's barely
twenty years old.

124
00:06:46,472 --> 00:06:48,838
He washed down a bottle
of xanax with bourbon.

125
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:49,999
Suicide?

126
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:51,201
So it appears.

127
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,641
I'll know for sure
after the autopsy.

128
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,840
You seen Bailey around?

129
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,254
You're the P.I.

130
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:03,686
You figure it out.

131
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,695
Detective, my
son was murdered.

132
00:07:12,799 --> 00:07:14,858
Someone did
this to him.

133
00:07:14,967 --> 00:07:16,798
Mrs. Hale,
we'll investigate--

134
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:17,665
"investigate"?

135
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,431
That coroner's already
made up her mind!

136
00:07:19,539 --> 00:07:20,563
No, she hasn't.

137
00:07:20,673 --> 00:07:23,301
Paul wouldn't kill himself
he wouldn't do that.

138
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:25,502
He did leave a note,
Mrs. Hale.

139
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:27,078
Detective Bailey.

140
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,580
Did you fall off a
wedding cake, Strachey?

141
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:31,946
Mrs. Hale, my name
is Donald Strachey,

142
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:33,109
I'm a private investigator.

143
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:36,017
I'm so sorry
about your son.

144
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:39,614
Thank you.

145
00:07:39,725 --> 00:07:41,693
God, my baby!

146
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,227
Can we make
this quick.

147
00:07:43,329 --> 00:07:45,456
Why did the deceased have
your card in his pocket?

148
00:07:45,565 --> 00:07:47,032
That's between him
and me.

149
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,363
Was he a client
or boyfriend?

150
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:51,767
What does that mean?

151
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:52,769
I met him
last night.

152
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:53,770
What are you implying?

153
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:56,740
My son was not gay,
if that's what you mean.

154
00:07:56,843 --> 00:08:00,643
Paul had been confused
for a while,

155
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:01,872
but he was
much better.

156
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,074
Dr. Cornell had
completely healed him.

157
00:08:04,183 --> 00:08:05,172
Cornell?

158
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:06,876
He runs that clinic-?

159
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:11,184
Yes, the Phoenix Foundation
for a better life.

160
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:12,314
He's a brilliant man.

161
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:15,360
He turned Paul's
life around.

162
00:08:15,461 --> 00:08:17,827
It appears Paul
Hale wasn't gay.

163
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:19,295
He was ex-gay.

164
00:08:22,568 --> 00:08:24,502
"Gay reparative therapy".

165
00:08:24,604 --> 00:08:25,901
Maybe you oughta give
it a shot, Strachey?

166
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:28,371
Awe and give up my
fantasies about you?

167
00:08:28,474 --> 00:08:30,101
Never.

168
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,267
So what exactly
happened last night

169
00:08:31,377 --> 00:08:33,038
between you and Paul Hale?

170
00:08:33,145 --> 00:08:34,737
Not much.

171
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:35,836
We talked a little bit.

172
00:08:35,948 --> 00:08:38,473
He hired me to
find somebody.

173
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,017
You gonna tell me who?

174
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:40,983
I don't know.

175
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,111
We didn't get that far.

176
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,620
Somebody tried
to run us over.

177
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,453
Probably just a disgruntled
ex-client of yours?

178
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:47,719
If it was an ex-client
of mine,

179
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:50,796
I'd be the dead
guy, don't you think?

180
00:08:50,897 --> 00:08:53,127
Paul took off, and that's
the last I saw of him.

181
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:54,221
"I'm sorry, mom.

182
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:55,322
"It's just too
much to take.

183
00:08:55,434 --> 00:08:57,197
"I love you, Paul."

184
00:08:57,303 --> 00:08:59,737
Kids today, even the suicide
notes are high tech.

185
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,103
Come on, Bailey,
the kid hires a P.I.

186
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,573
And then kills himself?

187
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,440
Maybe you didn't
inspire much confidence.

188
00:09:06,546 --> 00:09:08,309
What about his e-mails,
anything there?

189
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,678
No, and all the files
are wiped clean.

190
00:09:10,783 --> 00:09:12,375
Evidently he didn't want
anyone going through his stuff

191
00:09:12,485 --> 00:09:15,921
especially that mother
of his, is my guess.

192
00:09:16,022 --> 00:09:18,047
You wiped the keyboard
for any other prints?

193
00:09:18,157 --> 00:09:19,681
It's not a homicide.

194
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,657
Hale had a bunch of xanax
and a bunch of other pills

195
00:09:21,761 --> 00:09:23,490
right next to him and he
washed it down with liquor.

196
00:09:23,596 --> 00:09:25,962
It couldn't get much
clearer than that.

197
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:27,555
Let it go.

198
00:09:28,968 --> 00:09:31,300
No.

199
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:34,032
Paul Hale gave me
a $5,000 retainer.

200
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,506
I think I'm gonna make sure
he gets his money's worth.

201
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:17,206
Don't move!

202
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:23,021
Don't shoot!

203
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,054
It's only me,
Kenny Kwon!

204
00:10:24,156 --> 00:10:26,522
What're you doing trying
to break into my office,

205
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,524
break in?

206
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,855
Do I look like
a thief to you?

207
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:33,222
No.

208
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:35,960
You look familiar,
do I know you?

209
00:10:36,068 --> 00:10:37,194
You should.

210
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,203
You got me fired
from my job.

211
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,795
At the Parmalee
Plaza Hotel?

212
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:44,205
You trashed the office
and beat up my boss.

213
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,675
Oh, yeah.

214
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,336
That was you?

215
00:10:47,446 --> 00:10:49,277
You got canned for that?

216
00:10:49,382 --> 00:10:51,316
Job sucked anyway.

217
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:53,078
Well, I only beat up
people that need it.

218
00:10:53,185 --> 00:10:54,482
What're you doing here,
Kenny Kwon?

219
00:11:04,897 --> 00:11:06,888
Resume.

220
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,433
I was slipping one
under your door.

221
00:11:09,535 --> 00:11:12,129
I saw your ad in the paper
for a secretary

222
00:11:12,238 --> 00:11:13,933
and I recognized
your name.

223
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,032
I figure you owe
me at least that.

224
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,667
I don't pay much.

225
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,609
My unemployment checks
run out next week.

226
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:26,642
I've had six secretaries
in three months.

227
00:11:26,752 --> 00:11:28,185
They all quit
after a week.

228
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:29,413
With your sparkling
personality?

229
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:32,252
What a shocker.

230
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:33,723
And I prefer
"office manager".

231
00:11:39,098 --> 00:11:39,655
Oh, my gosh.

232
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,255
Somebody broke in and
trashed the place!

233
00:11:41,367 --> 00:11:42,425
Cute.

234
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,463
Strachey investigations,

235
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,507
Kenny Kwon, associate
investigator speaking,

236
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:51,132
how may I help you?

237
00:11:52,845 --> 00:11:54,278
Hold please,
I'll see if he's in.

238
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:57,081
He won't give his name,
but he says if you don't

239
00:11:57,183 --> 00:11:59,276
take the call you're
sleeping on the sofa?

240
00:12:00,753 --> 00:12:02,448
Here, go find the website,

241
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:03,715
it's called
the Phoenix Foundation

242
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,620
for a better tomorrow.

243
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:08,216
"Ex-gay'?

244
00:12:08,327 --> 00:12:10,352
Oh yeah, I dated
one of those guys.

245
00:12:10,463 --> 00:12:11,623
He was hot.

246
00:12:11,731 --> 00:12:14,291
Except he burst into tears
every time we had sex.

247
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,095
Figure out
what you can.

248
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:16,930
Does this mean
I'm hired?

249
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,060
It means I'm
thinking about it.

250
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,606
Go work, work, work...

251
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:23,299
hey, honey.

252
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,376
New secretary?

253
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:30,143
He prefers office manager.

254
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,147
And how's your day?

255
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:32,808
Well, it just got
more interesting.

256
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,317
The senator received
an invitation today

257
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,217
from your Dr. Cornell.

258
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:37,880
And their poster boy was

259
00:12:37,990 --> 00:12:39,252
Paul Hale.

260
00:12:42,695 --> 00:12:44,424
According to their
website, Dr. Trevor Cornell

261
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:46,794
is a board-certified
psychiatrist,

262
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,059
and the Phoenix
Foundation operates

263
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:50,158
one of the most successful
reparative therapy programs

264
00:12:50,269 --> 00:12:52,203
in New York.

265
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:55,102
I wonder what his
idea of successful is?

266
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,265
Dressing badly,

267
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,605
decorating your house
with duck decoys

268
00:12:58,711 --> 00:12:59,700
and breaking out in a rash

269
00:12:59,812 --> 00:13:01,973
every time you hear
Barbara Streisand sing.

270
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:03,241
Sounds good
to me...

271
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:09,510
Yes?

272
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:10,816
Uhm, is this...?

273
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:15,826
Is this, uh, the place
that helps--

274
00:13:15,928 --> 00:13:19,591
do you have an
appointment?

275
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:20,221
I'm sorry...

276
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:21,060
this was a bad idea.

277
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,429
I'm just going to go...

278
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:26,361
hold up!

279
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:28,963
Were you looking
for Dr. Cornell?

280
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,564
...yeah.

281
00:13:30,676 --> 00:13:34,703
Why don't you come in, I'll
see if he's available.

282
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,008
My name is grey.

283
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:37,275
I'm Kyle.

284
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,281
You work here?

285
00:13:38,384 --> 00:13:40,409
Just help out
once in a while.

286
00:13:40,519 --> 00:13:41,781
Glad you came.

287
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:42,945
Come in.

288
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,532
I'll go see if I can
find him for you, okay.

289
00:13:55,634 --> 00:13:56,999
I'll be right back.

290
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:48,017
Just put him out
of your mind.

291
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,087
You've gotta forget
about him,

292
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,780
he's not worth
crying over.

293
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,414
This was so
unfair of him.

294
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:55,186
Well, it was selfish,
that's all it was.

295
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:58,354
What Paul did was
completely selfish.

296
00:14:58,464 --> 00:14:59,761
If the police
find out...

297
00:14:59,865 --> 00:15:00,991
they won't, Katie.

298
00:15:13,445 --> 00:15:14,537
Got lost.

299
00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,248
Kyle?

300
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:29,223
Hi, I'm Lynne
Cornell, Trevor-

301
00:15:29,328 --> 00:15:31,193
Dr. Cornell's wife,

302
00:15:31,297 --> 00:15:33,060
we're really happy you've
paid us a visit.

303
00:15:33,165 --> 00:15:34,097
Well... honestly
Mrs. Cornell-

304
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:36,690
Lynne, please.

305
00:15:36,802 --> 00:15:38,667
Lynne, I didn't know
where else to go.

306
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,762
Well, you're
welcome here.

307
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:42,397
This way.

308
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,646
We're having a bit of
a rough day around here,

309
00:15:49,748 --> 00:15:51,579
but Trevor can take a few
minutes, if you'd like.

310
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,982
Does Dr. Cornell always
see everybody personally?

311
00:15:54,086 --> 00:15:56,384
Hmm-mm, he's always
made a point of it.

312
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:57,682
Although, that will
probably change

313
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,348
once we move to our
new headquarters.

314
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,688
I heard about that,
Washington, D.C., right?

315
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,761
Yes.

316
00:16:02,861 --> 00:16:05,022
Trevor's dedicated to helping
people all over this country

317
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:06,927
not just here
in New York.

318
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,592
It's going to be a big
job, but worth it

319
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:11,670
if we can save
one person like yourself.

320
00:16:15,441 --> 00:16:16,908
Trevor, this is Kyle--

321
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:17,907
griffin.

322
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,274
Trevor Cornell, nice
to meet you Kyle.

323
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,711
I've got some things
to take care of.

324
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,009
It's been a pleasure
meeting you, Kyle.

325
00:16:24,116 --> 00:16:25,777
You too, Lynne.

326
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,011
I hope to see
you again.

327
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,181
Sit down,
make yourself at home.

328
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,020
It's a really
nice place...

329
00:16:34,126 --> 00:16:36,185
it's a work in progress.

330
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:37,762
Guess we all are, right?

331
00:16:41,567 --> 00:16:43,000
How'd you hear
about us, Kyle?

332
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,797
A friend of mine.

333
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:49,305
Well, not really a friend,
just a guy I met

334
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:52,571
told me you really
helped him.

335
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,646
Our clients are
our best referrals.

336
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:56,305
You remember his name?

337
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:57,746
It was...

338
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,112
Paul Hale.

339
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,450
Paul...

340
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:13,963
you should know, Kyle,
Paul Hale died last night.

341
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:18,968
Terrible thing.

342
00:17:19,071 --> 00:17:23,337
We're all still trying
to deal with it here.

343
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:25,171
How?

344
00:17:25,277 --> 00:17:27,370
An accidental overdose.

345
00:17:27,479 --> 00:17:29,811
Accidental?

346
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:33,544
Paul was a very...
troubled young man.

347
00:17:33,652 --> 00:17:37,179
He was very confused.

348
00:17:37,289 --> 00:17:39,780
But I thought he was your
spokesman or something.

349
00:17:39,892 --> 00:17:42,156
That's what he told me.

350
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:45,628
Kyle, I'm more concerned
with how I can help you.

351
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:51,397
What exactly
are you looking for?

352
00:17:51,503 --> 00:17:54,563
I want my life back.

353
00:17:54,673 --> 00:17:57,938
We all deserve to have
the life we want.

354
00:17:58,043 --> 00:17:59,670
What happened to yours?

355
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:04,215
I was in the army,
a sergeant, actually.

356
00:18:04,316 --> 00:18:10,346
They kicked me
out for, you know...

357
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,684
for being gay.

358
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:16,852
What division were
you in?

359
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:19,157
1st brigade, 80th
division, echo company--

360
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,494
out of Maryland.

361
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:25,468
I tried to fit in
with the gay community

362
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:29,132
but I don't like it.

363
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:33,769
Kyle, the thing that
I want you to understand--

364
00:18:33,879 --> 00:18:34,573
to believe,

365
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:38,081
whether you work with us
here at Phoenix or not

366
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:42,085
is that you are
the only person

367
00:18:42,187 --> 00:18:44,655
who is allowed to
define who you are.

368
00:18:44,756 --> 00:18:47,884
Choosing a homosexual
lifestyle works for some,

369
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:49,858
but it's a choice.

370
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,863
A very restricting,
limiting choice.

371
00:18:52,965 --> 00:18:57,095
You can fix me?

372
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:59,500
Make me attracted
to women?

373
00:18:59,605 --> 00:19:00,970
I wish I could.

374
00:19:01,073 --> 00:19:03,541
I can't promise
you that, no one can.

375
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:08,875
Resisting your sexual urges
may be a lifetime issue.

376
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:11,279
So what's the point?

377
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:14,113
The point is to choose
to live a life,

378
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:16,016
not a lifestyle.

379
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:19,287
I'm sorry, Trevor,

380
00:19:19,391 --> 00:19:20,289
the group's
a little upset,

381
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:21,654
you might want
to speak with them.

382
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,921
Tell them I'll
be right there.

383
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:27,521
I'm sorry Kyle,
I wish we had more time.

384
00:19:27,633 --> 00:19:28,759
That's alright.

385
00:19:28,867 --> 00:19:32,769
Actually, we're having
a group session tomorrow.

386
00:19:32,871 --> 00:19:33,963
You should come.

387
00:19:34,072 --> 00:19:37,235
Meet some of the others
members of the foundation

388
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:39,401
see what we're doing
to help them.

389
00:19:39,511 --> 00:19:41,638
Alright. It'd be good.

390
00:19:41,747 --> 00:19:43,681
Then we'll see you
tomorrow night at 8:00

391
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:45,841
thank you, Dr. Cornell.

392
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,350
Trevor.

393
00:19:53,325 --> 00:19:55,156
Kyle...

394
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,784
welcome to the
Phoenix Foundation.

395
00:20:04,636 --> 00:20:07,696
I don't understand
exactly what you're looking
for.

396
00:20:07,806 --> 00:20:11,333
That's because I'm
not exactly sure.

397
00:20:11,443 --> 00:20:13,775
Your son hired
me to find somebody.

398
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:15,779
Find somebody, who?

399
00:20:15,881 --> 00:20:17,405
I was hoping you might
be able to tell me.

400
00:20:17,516 --> 00:20:20,610
I'm sure I have no idea.

401
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,380
Well, that
makes two of us.

402
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:23,920
But I'm thinking it
must have something to do

403
00:20:24,022 --> 00:20:25,512
with Trevor Cornell
or his group.

404
00:20:25,624 --> 00:20:26,989
Why would you think that?

405
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,923
Because they're
furious with him.

406
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:30,153
Whatever your
son was doing,

407
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:32,127
it was pissing off a lot
of people.

408
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:35,530
Those people were
Paul's friends.

409
00:20:35,634 --> 00:20:37,602
Okay.

410
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:41,639
Do you know who might
want your son dead?

411
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:44,732
Isn't it obvious?

412
00:20:44,843 --> 00:20:47,676
Homosexuals.

413
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:51,112
If somebody like Paul could
turn away from that life,

414
00:20:51,216 --> 00:20:53,116
could go straight

415
00:20:53,218 --> 00:20:54,207
just think,

416
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:56,378
how inspirational
that would have been?

417
00:20:56,488 --> 00:20:58,979
You don't like gay people
very much, do you Mrs. Hale?

418
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,562
All I ever wanted

419
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:10,134
was what was best
for my son.

420
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:14,934
To see him healthy
and safe and happy.

421
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:20,478
If you really want to find
out who killed him,

422
00:21:20,579 --> 00:21:23,139
this is where I would
start, Larry Phelps.

423
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:27,950
Paul kept his photo up.

424
00:21:28,053 --> 00:21:30,419
They were best friends
since they were kids.

425
00:21:30,522 --> 00:21:33,685
I'm sure he's the reason
Paul became confused

426
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:35,123
to begin with.

427
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:37,752
So you think this kid
would've hurt Paul?

428
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:38,693
For the last year,

429
00:21:38,797 --> 00:21:40,765
ever since Paul got
himself turned around,

430
00:21:40,866 --> 00:21:43,096
Larry's done nothing
but harass my son

431
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:46,068
calling him
a traitor, a fraud.

432
00:21:46,171 --> 00:21:47,195
Paul was very upset.

433
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,206
So why didn't he just
steer clear from him?

434
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,868
They were in film school
at university together.

435
00:21:51,977 --> 00:21:54,343
He couldn't just
steer clear.

436
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:01,477
Okay, I'll talk
with Mr. Phelps.

437
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:02,575
You don't have
to lie to me

438
00:22:02,688 --> 00:22:05,088
I'm not the one
paying your fee.

439
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:06,987
The only reason you're
even investigating this case

440
00:22:07,092 --> 00:22:10,255
is so you can smear
Dr. Cornell's good name.

441
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:12,421
That's all you really
care about it, isn't it?

442
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:16,763
Your son came to me
and asked for my help.

443
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:18,460
He asked me if he
could trust me

444
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,696
and I told him he could.

445
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:20,829
If somebody murdered him,

446
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:23,430
I don't really don't give
a damn who they sleep with.

447
00:22:23,542 --> 00:22:25,134
I'll find them.

448
00:22:28,046 --> 00:22:29,445
Goodbye, Mrs. Hale.

449
00:23:18,764 --> 00:23:19,321
Larry Phelps around?

450
00:23:27,372 --> 00:23:29,067
Larry,

451
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:29,970
name is Donald Strachey,

452
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,235
I'm wondering if I can talk
to you a little bit?

453
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:35,675
Hey, Larry, wait!

454
00:23:38,016 --> 00:23:38,914
Larry!

455
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:39,949
Larry!

456
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:43,486
Larry!

457
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:04,140
Larry!

458
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:05,732
You're starting
to piss me off!

459
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:19,051
What the hell are
you running from?!

460
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:20,181
Go to hell!

461
00:24:20,292 --> 00:24:20,917
There's a lot of
people that saw you

462
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,118
you won't get
away with it.

463
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:25,594
I don't know what
you're talking about!

464
00:24:25,697 --> 00:24:26,891
That's why you
attacked me.

465
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:28,295
Attacked you?

466
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,890
Listen asshole-

467
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:34,338
look, let's start
over, alright?

468
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:53,552
Strachey.

469
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:59,028
Yeah, I'm pretty
close, why?

470
00:24:59,130 --> 00:25:00,427
I'll be there in
fifteen minutes.

471
00:25:03,235 --> 00:25:04,930
Better make that
a half hour.

472
00:25:16,615 --> 00:25:18,549
Hey, look who's here,
if it isn't Albany's

473
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:20,481
most famous gay dick.

474
00:25:20,585 --> 00:25:21,813
Don't sell yourself
short, Stenski

475
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,784
the boys I've
talked to say

476
00:25:22,888 --> 00:25:24,321
you ain't so
bad yourself.

477
00:25:26,258 --> 00:25:27,953
Looking good wherever
you go, Strachey.

478
00:25:28,059 --> 00:25:28,650
What can I say?

479
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:30,728
This place just brings
out the best in me.

480
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:39,733
Coroner ruled
it a suicide.

481
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:42,136
Drug overdose, just
like we thought.

482
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:42,968
Phenelzine?

483
00:25:43,074 --> 00:25:44,063
That's right.

484
00:25:44,175 --> 00:25:45,301
I thought he took xanax?

485
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:46,775
Yeah, well, we found xanax
right next to the body.

486
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,368
But no trace of
it in his system.

487
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,414
It turns out it was the
phenelzine that killed him.

488
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:52,506
Did he have a prescription
for phenelzine?

489
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,050
No, he didn't have
a prescription for either.

490
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:55,983
That's why Dr. Sung
didn't suspect anything.

491
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:57,486
She figures whoever
gave him the xanax

492
00:25:57,589 --> 00:25:59,454
gave him
the phenelzine as well.

493
00:25:59,558 --> 00:26:01,048
Plus, the crime
scene, the note,

494
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:03,286
everything indicates
suicide.

495
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:05,363
So who gave him
the pills?

496
00:26:05,463 --> 00:26:06,930
That's none
of my business.

497
00:26:07,032 --> 00:26:08,294
I investigate homicides.

498
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,027
The coroner
ruled it a suicide.

499
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:11,693
This case is closed.

500
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,777
You might as well
take this with you,

501
00:26:20,879 --> 00:26:24,280
I have another
copy in the files.

502
00:26:24,382 --> 00:26:25,781
Thank you.

503
00:26:27,385 --> 00:26:29,080
Strachey...

504
00:26:29,187 --> 00:26:30,620
what's the deal
with this kid?

505
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:31,984
Why the interest?

506
00:26:33,291 --> 00:26:35,259
I don't know.

507
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,328
I guess he reminds me of
somebody I used to know.

508
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:38,589
A long time ago.

509
00:27:57,909 --> 00:27:58,432
Hello!

510
00:27:58,543 --> 00:28:00,477
You here?

511
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,409
Yeah, I'm up here!

512
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:09,846
Okay, I've got
Thai takeout,

513
00:28:09,954 --> 00:28:12,184
double chocolate
fudge ice cream

514
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,019
with optional hot fudge

515
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,685
and that movie with
the two straight guys

516
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:17,693
playing gay guys,

517
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:19,559
playing two straight girls
to seduce their boss.

518
00:28:19,664 --> 00:28:21,291
Or something.

519
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:22,127
I'm sorry

520
00:28:22,233 --> 00:28:23,359
I have to work tonight.

521
00:28:23,468 --> 00:28:25,026
But it's Tuesday night.

522
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,296
We watch movies
on Tuesday night.

523
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:29,965
I know, but it's
this Paul Hale thing.

524
00:28:30,075 --> 00:28:31,565
The suicide?

525
00:28:31,676 --> 00:28:32,700
Maybe not.

526
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:34,836
But I thought they found the
pills right next to his body?

527
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:35,537
They did.

528
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,376
They did, but Paul
didn't take them.

529
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:38,972
So how did he die?

530
00:28:39,084 --> 00:28:41,416
They found another
antidepressant in his system

531
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,451
called phenelzine,

532
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:45,114
it causes a nasty reaction
when taken with alcohol.

533
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:48,454
Like a stroke in an otherwise
healthy 21-year old?

534
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,356
Right.

535
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:50,894
Paul was drinking
bourbon that night.

536
00:28:50,995 --> 00:28:52,690
So somebody could have
slipped it into his drink

537
00:28:52,797 --> 00:28:54,025
without him knowing?

538
00:28:54,132 --> 00:28:55,156
Murder.

539
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:57,200
Or he took it himself.

540
00:28:57,302 --> 00:28:58,394
I intend
to find out.

541
00:28:58,503 --> 00:28:59,527
I'm doing a little
undercover work tonight

542
00:28:59,637 --> 00:29:00,865
at the Phoenix Foundation.

543
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:05,105
Isn't that the sweater
my mother made you?

544
00:29:05,210 --> 00:29:06,472
Yup.

545
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,340
It's group therapy.

546
00:29:07,445 --> 00:29:08,469
I have to blend in
with all the other

547
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:09,774
recovering homosexuals.

548
00:29:09,881 --> 00:29:11,041
I won't tell her
you said that.

549
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:13,117
You think someone there
might know something

550
00:29:13,218 --> 00:29:14,776
about Paul's death?

551
00:29:14,886 --> 00:29:16,285
Well, it's possible.

552
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:17,354
They're definitely
hiding something

553
00:29:17,455 --> 00:29:18,717
there's something they don't
want the police to know about

554
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:20,791
and I intend to find
out what it is.

555
00:29:20,892 --> 00:29:21,881
You have to save me
some Thai food,

556
00:29:21,993 --> 00:29:23,221
and don't eat all
the ice cream, piggy.

557
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:27,394
Good luck.

558
00:29:27,499 --> 00:29:29,558
And don't let him
brainwash you.

559
00:29:31,402 --> 00:29:32,801
I'm the only one
who gets to do that.

560
00:29:47,018 --> 00:29:50,317
...I was a freshman at NYU,

561
00:29:50,421 --> 00:29:54,619
thought I was gonna be
this huge artist, you know?

562
00:29:54,726 --> 00:29:56,193
My first winter
was so shitty,

563
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,852
being away
from home and all.

564
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:02,763
So that's when I started,
you know, doin' things...

565
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:04,892
gay things.

566
00:30:05,003 --> 00:30:07,528
Goin' to clubs,
going to bars.

567
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:11,336
And pretty soon,
I was doing drugs, too.

568
00:30:11,442 --> 00:30:13,137
I just wanted
to meet somebody,

569
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:16,407
fall in love,
all that stuff.

570
00:30:16,514 --> 00:30:18,004
But it's just like
the whole scene,

571
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:20,141
it's so crazy.

572
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:25,252
So what changed
for you, Jefferson?

573
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:27,187
What brought you here?

574
00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:31,058
A few weeks ago,
I went to this party

575
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,857
and for
the first time ever

576
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:36,866
I felt, just
really dirty,

577
00:30:36,968 --> 00:30:38,265
I hated myself.

578
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:41,532
I pretty much
hated everything.

579
00:30:41,639 --> 00:30:44,005
I couldn't break free.

580
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:47,976
I came back to Albany
to get some distance.

581
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:50,445
To figure
shit out.

582
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:54,575
"Turn now every one
of you from his evil way,

583
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:57,052
"and then you shall dwell
in the land which I gave

584
00:30:57,155 --> 00:31:01,251
"to you
and your fathers."

585
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:06,797
We have one new member
joining us tonight,

586
00:31:06,898 --> 00:31:09,458
Kyle?

587
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:12,798
I'm, uh, just
checking it out,

588
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:14,565
see, if it will
work for me.

589
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:19,637
What's Kyle doing...?

590
00:31:19,744 --> 00:31:21,268
Self-defining.

591
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:24,143
Yes, self-defining.

592
00:31:24,249 --> 00:31:25,682
I can't tell Kyle
this is the way to go.

593
00:31:25,783 --> 00:31:28,183
You can't tell him.

594
00:31:28,286 --> 00:31:31,949
The choices we make
are our own choices.

595
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:36,891
But you do have
the choice to change.

596
00:31:36,995 --> 00:31:39,020
It's not going
to be easy.

597
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,189
But you have
to ask yourself

598
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:43,267
what's the value of
something if you don't have

599
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:45,233
to fight for it?

600
00:31:45,336 --> 00:31:48,828
Life's a challenge,
a struggle,

601
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,032
there's nothing wrong
with working hard

602
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:52,371
for something
you believe in.

603
00:31:52,477 --> 00:31:57,039
Choosing a straight lifestyle
opens up all kinds of doors,

604
00:31:57,148 --> 00:31:58,911
amazing opportunities.

605
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:02,111
It's a path most homosexuals
are not strong enough to take.

606
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:06,020
It takes faith
and commitment.

607
00:32:06,124 --> 00:32:07,751
You have to be
extremely motivated

608
00:32:07,859 --> 00:32:10,020
you have to want something
better for yourself

609
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:13,029
and your family
so badly

610
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:13,995
that you can resist
the temptations

611
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:20,059
that will
surely come.

612
00:32:20,171 --> 00:32:22,833
I know we were all very
upset to hear the news

613
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:24,670
of Paul Hale's death.

614
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,744
All I can say about
it right now is

615
00:32:26,844 --> 00:32:28,778
I'm happy to talk
to any of you about Paul

616
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,040
in our individual sessions.

617
00:32:30,148 --> 00:32:33,481
But right now I want to
keep our group time focused

618
00:32:33,584 --> 00:32:35,211
on one thing:

619
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,719
You.

620
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:38,584
Your struggles.

621
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,749
And how we can
all help each other

622
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:43,053
to achieve the happiness
we deserve.

623
00:32:46,230 --> 00:32:47,492
...we play basketball
on Saturdays

624
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:48,860
you should come.

625
00:32:48,967 --> 00:32:50,798
Here?

626
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:53,666
A lot of the guys need
help getting comfortable

627
00:32:53,771 --> 00:32:56,365
with a more
masculine role.

628
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,374
Basketball makes
them more "masculine"?

629
00:32:58,476 --> 00:33:01,877
Sports, yeah, definitely.

630
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:04,881
I mean, you don't look like
you've got that problem,

631
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:07,349
but some of these
guys... man.

632
00:33:07,452 --> 00:33:09,386
Need help, huh?

633
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:10,784
It's like they've never
seen a football game

634
00:33:10,888 --> 00:33:13,254
in their life.

635
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:15,485
Part of the program is about
learning how to be friends

636
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:19,029
with guys without
sleeping with them.

637
00:33:19,130 --> 00:33:21,496
If you want to immigrate
into straight society,

638
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:23,658
you gotta know what people
are talking about, right?

639
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:30,697
Yeah, I'll catch up
with you in a bit.

640
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,474
See you Saturday!

641
00:33:39,584 --> 00:33:42,018
Hi, we didn't get
a chance to meet.

642
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:42,814
Oh, hi.

643
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:43,579
Katie.

644
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:44,586
Kyle.

645
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:46,623
Wow, good grip.

646
00:33:46,724 --> 00:33:48,885
Sorry, I'm supposed
to be more-

647
00:33:48,993 --> 00:33:50,051
I won't tell anybody.

648
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:51,458
It's just so hard.

649
00:33:51,562 --> 00:33:54,053
There's so much
to remember.

650
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:55,325
You been here
a long time?

651
00:33:55,433 --> 00:33:56,923
About five months.

652
00:33:57,035 --> 00:33:58,332
It's been amazing

653
00:33:58,436 --> 00:34:00,495
I'm so much better now.

654
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:02,072
According to who?

655
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:13,581
So you knew this
guy, Paul Hale?

656
00:34:13,684 --> 00:34:16,949
Yeah, I knew
him really well.

657
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,886
Nice guy?

658
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,548
The best.

659
00:34:20,658 --> 00:34:23,491
We were engaged.

660
00:34:23,594 --> 00:34:25,255
Engaged?

661
00:34:25,363 --> 00:34:27,160
Before everything changed.

662
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:28,061
What changed?

663
00:34:28,166 --> 00:34:29,929
Katie, let's get you
home, okay, honey?

664
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,909
Kyle,

665
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:45,744
Kyle, if you'd like,

666
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:48,318
I've got time for an
individual session tomorrow

667
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,910
at 2:00.

668
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:56,858
Uhm, alright, cool.

669
00:34:56,961 --> 00:34:58,622
I'll look forward
to it.

670
00:34:58,729 --> 00:35:00,219
Me too, thanks.

671
00:35:22,186 --> 00:35:24,245
Kyle, I hope you
enjoyed tonight,

672
00:35:24,355 --> 00:35:25,788
we're really glad
you're here.

673
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,482
Thank you.

674
00:35:27,592 --> 00:35:28,786
See you tomorrow.

675
00:35:28,893 --> 00:35:30,019
Count on it.

676
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:30,822
Goodnight.

677
00:35:30,928 --> 00:35:32,088
Goodnight.

678
00:36:44,168 --> 00:36:46,261
You've got the
intimidation thing
down pat...

679
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:49,635
but your trailer
skills suck.

680
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,265
I know who you are.

681
00:36:52,376 --> 00:36:53,206
Recognized you from
that article

682
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:56,838
in the advocate
last year.

683
00:36:56,948 --> 00:36:58,848
Who're you working for?

684
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,679
Why? You have
something to hide?

685
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:03,015
Listen to me,
Walter's a good man!

686
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,884
If his father's got
you sneaking around
trying to dig-

687
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:06,854
who's Walter?

688
00:37:06,958 --> 00:37:08,425
The punk next
to me in the meeting?

689
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:10,517
He's trying, man.

690
00:37:10,628 --> 00:37:12,926
Bending over
backwards, trying to
do everything he can.

691
00:37:13,030 --> 00:37:13,689
Slow down,

692
00:37:13,798 --> 00:37:15,959
I don't know what
you're talking about.

693
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:17,295
You're not working
for Walter's father?

694
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:18,800
No.

695
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:21,201
Why would Walter's
father hire a P.I.?

696
00:37:21,305 --> 00:37:24,468
To check up on him.

697
00:37:24,575 --> 00:37:30,275
He's trying to find
out if Walter's
really gone straight.

698
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:34,875
How long have you and
Walter been together?

699
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:38,387
Three years.

700
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:39,854
Don't you think
it's a little late

701
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:42,551
for Walter to try convincing
his father he's straight?

702
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:44,457
Not when his father's
lying on his death bed.

703
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:47,759
And worth over
$5 million.

704
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:50,527
I get it.

705
00:37:50,635 --> 00:37:53,604
Can you tell me anything
about Paul Hale?

706
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:54,466
I know that
something going on

707
00:37:54,572 --> 00:37:56,938
you guys don't want
the police to know about.

708
00:37:57,041 --> 00:38:01,341
Honestly, I don't know
exactly what was going on.

709
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:05,438
Paul was always
the golden boy

710
00:38:05,549 --> 00:38:06,948
over the past few
weeks, though...

711
00:38:07,051 --> 00:38:10,179
problems?

712
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:13,724
It was like Paul just
had enough one day.

713
00:38:13,824 --> 00:38:16,987
He started asking
these really pointed
questions to Cornell,

714
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:19,187
and made it real
uncomfortable for him.

715
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,662
About the foundation?

716
00:38:20,765 --> 00:38:22,995
Yeah, about everything.

717
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,533
Then, on Tuesday,

718
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,069
there was this
big blowout.

719
00:38:27,171 --> 00:38:30,038
During group in front
of everybody.

720
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:33,907
Paul and Cornell really
went at each other.

721
00:38:34,011 --> 00:38:36,809
Paul threatened to
leave the program.

722
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:39,644
Cornell said how devastated
Paul's mother'd be.

723
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:46,416
Finally,
Paul just left.

724
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:50,051
I've never seen
Cornell so angry.

725
00:38:52,897 --> 00:38:54,865
It was ugly.

726
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:57,432
So it sounds like
Paul was on the road

727
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:58,729
to being an ex-ex-gay.

728
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:00,269
Levon?

729
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,774
I didn't know
where you went.

730
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:08,072
I was just talking
over here.

731
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,737
It's okay, he isn't
working for your father.

732
00:39:09,847 --> 00:39:12,907
He's checking
into Paul's death.

733
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:14,075
Hey, Walter...

734
00:39:14,185 --> 00:39:17,211
we need to go.

735
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:19,983
He's always like
this after group.

736
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:22,150
Levon, I'm leaving.

737
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:25,422
If you want to
come, then come on.

738
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:27,656
See why I gotta
be around?

739
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:47,147
Kenny--

740
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:56,620
sorry, sorry.

741
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:57,557
I know I'm late,

742
00:39:57,661 --> 00:39:58,821
but apparently that twink
at the coffee shop

743
00:39:58,929 --> 00:40:00,726
doesn't know the difference
between a chai latte

744
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:02,059
and a chaicuccino.

745
00:40:02,166 --> 00:40:03,895
I mean, you call
yourself a barista

746
00:40:04,001 --> 00:40:05,332
and you can't even get
the orders right?

747
00:40:05,436 --> 00:40:06,733
I need you to do some
research for me.

748
00:40:06,837 --> 00:40:08,498
Find a guy by the name
of Walter Tidlow.

749
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:09,834
Apparently his father's
got a ton of money.

750
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,771
See what you can find
out about the family.

751
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:12,604
Tidlow.

752
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:15,270
Got it.

753
00:40:15,379 --> 00:40:17,142
What the hell is this?

754
00:40:17,248 --> 00:40:20,046
Organic green leaf broth
with bee pollen and clover.

755
00:40:20,151 --> 00:40:21,083
I thought with
your temper,

756
00:40:21,185 --> 00:40:22,948
you should probably lay off
the caffeine for a few weeks.

757
00:40:27,291 --> 00:40:29,225
So these ex-gay people,
were they all, like,

758
00:40:29,326 --> 00:40:31,317
total freaks?

759
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,364
No, they're... people.

760
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:35,955
Confused people.

761
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:39,524
But that doctor, he must
be totally whacked, right?

762
00:40:39,637 --> 00:40:44,233
Actually, it's a
little disturbing how
not-whacked he is.

763
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:45,774
I saw a picture of him.

764
00:40:45,876 --> 00:40:47,036
He's kinda cute,

765
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:48,509
you think he's into
Asian guys?

766
00:40:48,612 --> 00:40:50,944
Kenny, the good
doctor is straight.

767
00:40:51,048 --> 00:40:52,515
Of course he is.

768
00:40:52,616 --> 00:40:54,015
And I'm next year's
starting point guard

769
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:56,814
for the Knicks.

770
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:58,752
I'm impressed you know
what a point guard is!

771
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:00,050
I dated one.

772
00:41:00,157 --> 00:41:02,182
The sex was great but
I always had to hide

773
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,318
in the back seat
at away games.

774
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:27,614
Katie...

775
00:41:27,718 --> 00:41:28,377
hey.

776
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,009
Hey...

777
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:30,711
can I talk to you?

778
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,152
I have to get to work...

779
00:41:32,256 --> 00:41:33,518
at the fire
station, right?

780
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:34,750
How do you know
where I work?

781
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:36,451
I was talking to
grey last night,

782
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,357
I just had some questions
about the program,

783
00:41:38,462 --> 00:41:40,259
do you have
time for lunch?

784
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:46,997
My dad's the fire chief,
all my brothers are

785
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:48,071
in the department.

786
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:49,696
You're the only girl?

787
00:41:49,807 --> 00:41:51,138
No, I have a sister.

788
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:53,472
But she's this
total princess.

789
00:41:53,577 --> 00:41:54,635
Married this great guy,

790
00:41:54,745 --> 00:41:57,043
has the most
beautiful baby girl

791
00:41:57,147 --> 00:41:59,012
she's perfect.

792
00:41:59,116 --> 00:42:00,743
Sounds like a lot
to live up to.

793
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:02,716
We're just
really different.

794
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,845
It's like I live and
work at the station house.

795
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:06,252
It's a family.

796
00:42:06,357 --> 00:42:08,917
I just want to be
normal like them.

797
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:11,017
And who says
you're not normal?

798
00:42:11,128 --> 00:42:12,152
You know what I mean.

799
00:42:12,263 --> 00:42:14,288
I mean, that's why
you're there, right?

800
00:42:14,398 --> 00:42:16,093
It's so unfair that
we can't live normal lives

801
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,895
like everybody else.

802
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:19,902
I bet your family
was pretty excited

803
00:42:20,004 --> 00:42:21,835
about you and Paul
getting engaged...

804
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,236
they didn't know.

805
00:42:23,340 --> 00:42:24,534
No one did.

806
00:42:24,642 --> 00:42:27,509
We weren't supposed
to tell anyone.

807
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:29,340
Why keep it a secret?

808
00:42:29,446 --> 00:42:30,811
There's this big
fundraiser planned

809
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:33,008
for next week,
to raise money.

810
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:36,177
Paul and Trevor wanted
to wait until then.

811
00:42:36,287 --> 00:42:38,619
They thought it would
really help the foundation,

812
00:42:38,722 --> 00:42:40,849
you know, with all the
press being there and all.

813
00:42:41,959 --> 00:42:45,190
Were you in love
with Paul?

814
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:47,787
Paul and I made
the choice to
love one another.

815
00:42:47,898 --> 00:42:51,891
Because we deserved
to have a normal life.

816
00:42:52,002 --> 00:42:55,699
Katie, last night
you told me that you
were engaged to Paul

817
00:42:55,806 --> 00:42:58,969
until everything changed

818
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,737
what happened?

819
00:43:00,844 --> 00:43:04,405
Why are you asking me
all these questions?

820
00:43:04,515 --> 00:43:06,813
I just want to know
what I'm in for.

821
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:08,350
I gotta go
to the station house.

822
00:43:08,452 --> 00:43:10,443
I know you're
afraid of the police.

823
00:43:10,554 --> 00:43:11,486
If you don't
talk to me now,

824
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:16,891
I think you'll be
talking to them.

825
00:43:16,994 --> 00:43:19,360
Who are you?

826
00:43:19,463 --> 00:43:21,624
Paul came to see me,
right before he died.

827
00:43:21,732 --> 00:43:23,495
He was scared.

828
00:43:23,601 --> 00:43:26,035
He wanted me
to help him.

829
00:43:26,136 --> 00:43:28,536
Help him do what?

830
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,836
I was hoping you
could tell me...

831
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:33,000
I don't know...

832
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:34,407
Katie, yesterday
I overheard you talking

833
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:37,241
to Walter and
you were crying,

834
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:38,713
you said there was
something you were afraid

835
00:43:38,816 --> 00:43:41,512
the police were going
to find out.

836
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:42,881
Talk to me.

837
00:43:42,987 --> 00:43:49,017
Did you have something
to do with Paul's death?

838
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:52,152
It's my fault.

839
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:54,992
It's my fault
he's dead.

840
00:43:55,099 --> 00:43:57,966
Why is it
your fault?

841
00:43:58,068 --> 00:43:59,399
I didn't mean to...

842
00:43:59,503 --> 00:44:02,370
I thought
it would help...

843
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,498
what did you
do, Katie?!

844
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:08,203
The pills he took,
I gave them to him.

845
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,244
What pills?

846
00:44:09,346 --> 00:44:10,108
The xanax,

847
00:44:10,214 --> 00:44:13,149
that night, after he
got so mad at Trevor.

848
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:15,275
They were mine, I thought
they'd help him.

849
00:44:15,386 --> 00:44:20,187
Katie, Paul never
took the xanax.

850
00:44:20,290 --> 00:44:22,224
What?

851
00:44:22,326 --> 00:44:23,224
Did you give him
anything else?

852
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,157
Any other drugs?

853
00:44:24,261 --> 00:44:26,729
No, I just had those
because I sometimes

854
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:28,559
get really nervous

855
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:34,832
I mean, I didn't...?

856
00:44:34,938 --> 00:44:36,906
No.

857
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:54,479
Can I help you?

858
00:44:54,591 --> 00:44:55,751
I'm here for
my appointment.

859
00:44:55,859 --> 00:44:57,520
Great, come on in.

860
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,531
Kyle, hi, it's nice
to see you again.

861
00:45:08,639 --> 00:45:10,163
Trevor and I are running
a few minutes late,

862
00:45:10,274 --> 00:45:11,502
would you mind waiting
in the lounge?

863
00:45:11,608 --> 00:45:12,540
Sure, no problem.

864
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:13,610
Great, we'll hurry.

865
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:35,428
Hey, man!

866
00:45:35,532 --> 00:45:36,794
You wanna play?

867
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,868
I thought it
was Saturdays.

868
00:45:38,969 --> 00:45:40,197
I play every
chance I get.

869
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:44,100
Go for it.

870
00:45:48,712 --> 00:45:50,839
Definitely have
to get you here
for Saturdays, man.

871
00:45:53,283 --> 00:45:56,116
So...

872
00:45:56,220 --> 00:45:59,417
grey, what do
you do for a living?

873
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:01,718
Pharmaceutical sales.

874
00:46:01,825 --> 00:46:04,589
It's nice, get to set
my own hours.

875
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:05,719
How about you,

876
00:46:05,829 --> 00:46:07,922
you're off in the
middle of the day, too.

877
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:09,430
Insurance.

878
00:46:13,070 --> 00:46:16,437
So you here
to see Trevor, huh?

879
00:46:16,540 --> 00:46:18,030
You know it's tough,

880
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:19,234
it really is,

881
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:23,473
but it's definitely
worth it.

882
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:24,979
You've been coming
here for a little while.

883
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:26,515
Off and on,
a couple of years.

884
00:46:28,652 --> 00:46:30,882
Off and on?

885
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:35,687
Had a relapse
a couple of times.

886
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,021
It's hard to resist.

887
00:46:37,127 --> 00:46:38,492
Good looking guys.

888
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:39,755
Why bother?

889
00:46:44,701 --> 00:46:45,998
Cause of this.

890
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:01,943
Your family?

891
00:47:02,052 --> 00:47:03,349
Yeah.

892
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,255
Jessica left me once.

893
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:12,555
Never again.

894
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,392
I wear it around my
neck to remind myself.

895
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:21,738
But isn't that just
like living a lie?

896
00:47:24,474 --> 00:47:26,135
Every night I go
home to my family,

897
00:47:26,243 --> 00:47:29,212
have dinner with them,

898
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:31,304
read my kids stories
before I put them to bed.

899
00:47:31,415 --> 00:47:33,110
That's no lie.

900
00:47:33,217 --> 00:47:35,777
Sounds tough.

901
00:47:35,886 --> 00:47:36,853
It's harder than hell,

902
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:41,323
if you want
to know the truth.

903
00:47:41,425 --> 00:47:43,791
And the worst part is

904
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:48,194
it doesn't get
any easier.

905
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:49,629
I can tell.

906
00:47:49,733 --> 00:47:51,030
Kyle?

907
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:52,396
We're ready now.

908
00:47:57,474 --> 00:47:58,805
Good luck, man.

909
00:48:00,577 --> 00:48:01,839
You, too.

910
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:16,887
And just sign there
at the bottom.

911
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:25,601
He's not gonna perform shock
therapy or a lobotomy, is he?

912
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:27,636
We don't advocate that
treatment any longer.

913
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:29,296
We haven't
for several years.

914
00:48:34,144 --> 00:48:35,270
But isn't all
this just saying that

915
00:48:35,379 --> 00:48:37,506
reparative therapy
doesn't really work?

916
00:48:37,614 --> 00:48:38,546
Not at all.

917
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:41,015
This is simply what they
call "informed consent",

918
00:48:41,118 --> 00:48:42,585
making it clear to you
that this is an area

919
00:48:42,686 --> 00:48:45,086
where psychologists have
many different opinions.

920
00:48:45,188 --> 00:48:47,588
"The American
Psychological Association

921
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:49,659
"and the American
Psychiatric Association

922
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,456
"oppose all portrayals of
lesbian, gay and bisexual

923
00:48:52,562 --> 00:48:54,496
"people as mentally ill
and in need of treatment

924
00:48:54,598 --> 00:48:57,829
"due to their
sexual orientation."

925
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,095
Sad, isn't it?

926
00:48:59,202 --> 00:49:00,669
How political correctness
has pervaded even

927
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:03,638
into the world of medicine
and mental health.

928
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,605
The real
question, Kyle, is

929
00:49:05,709 --> 00:49:07,176
do you think it
will work for you?

930
00:49:18,889 --> 00:49:20,151
Thank you.

931
00:49:25,028 --> 00:49:26,586
You have a very nice
looking family.

932
00:49:26,697 --> 00:49:29,359
You could,
too, one day.

933
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:31,934
What about your son,
is he in college?

934
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:34,230
Excellent,
well, everything's
looks to be order.

935
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:36,033
Let me see if Trevor's
ready for you.

936
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:50,153
So, Kyle, tell me,

937
00:49:50,253 --> 00:49:51,982
if you hadn't pursued
a gay lifestyle,

938
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:54,250
who would you be today?

939
00:49:54,358 --> 00:49:56,223
Well, I really didn't pursued
anything in my life,

940
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:58,556
it just evolved.

941
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,027
You're avoiding
my question.

942
00:50:00,130 --> 00:50:01,427
Who would
you be today?

943
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:02,589
I don't know.

944
00:50:02,699 --> 00:50:05,429
Imagine.

945
00:50:05,535 --> 00:50:08,561
I guess I would probably
still be in the army,

946
00:50:08,672 --> 00:50:10,105
definitely.

947
00:50:10,207 --> 00:50:13,005
And what do you
think that would
have been like?

948
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:16,045
Just gotten a promotion
to military intelligence,

949
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:18,580
that would have
been interesting.

950
00:50:18,682 --> 00:50:19,671
And how do you think
that would have been,

951
00:50:19,783 --> 00:50:21,808
military intelligence?

952
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:24,250
It was what I wanted,

953
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:28,017
I had worked really hard
for it for a couple years.

954
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,592
It was how I always
saw myself.

955
00:50:29,693 --> 00:50:31,593
So the army was going
to be your career?

956
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:34,721
Not my career,
my life.

957
00:50:34,831 --> 00:50:37,595
Were you
a good soldier?

958
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,795
Yeah, the best.

959
00:50:40,904 --> 00:50:43,202
I have no doubt.

960
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:46,400
Kyle, I want you to think
about these things.

961
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:48,637
The roads not taken

962
00:50:48,745 --> 00:50:50,736
the roads that are
closed to you

963
00:50:50,847 --> 00:50:53,611
when you self-define
as homosexual.

964
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,708
When you understand
those consequences,

965
00:50:55,819 --> 00:50:58,049
you have the strength
on the road to recovery.

966
00:50:58,155 --> 00:50:59,349
Recovery?

967
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:02,550
The recovery of everything
you could have been.

968
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:04,627
The restoration of a freer,
more open life.

969
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:08,562
Not being ghetto-ized by
living in the "gay" area.

970
00:51:08,665 --> 00:51:11,190
Not having your politics
decided for you

971
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:14,270
because you're supposed
to support "gay" issues.

972
00:51:14,371 --> 00:51:16,601
You give up aspects of
your own individuality

973
00:51:16,706 --> 00:51:19,937
the moment you identify
yourself as gay.

974
00:51:20,043 --> 00:51:21,840
You and I we'll
work together

975
00:51:21,945 --> 00:51:24,413
on giving you
back a normal life,

976
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:27,677
the way nature and
god intended it.

977
00:51:27,784 --> 00:51:29,752
God?

978
00:51:31,488 --> 00:51:32,546
If god wanted it that way,

979
00:51:32,656 --> 00:51:35,284
why didn't he just make me
straight to begin with?

980
00:51:35,392 --> 00:51:37,553
He did,

981
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:40,255
but we'll talk about that
in our next session.

982
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:41,853
We can explore your
family dynamics,

983
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:43,398
better understand

984
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:46,663
where you deviated
from the path.

985
00:51:46,770 --> 00:51:47,828
Okay?

986
00:51:47,938 --> 00:51:50,964
What about you,
Dr. Cornell.

987
00:51:51,074 --> 00:51:52,974
Are you everything
you wanted to be?

988
00:51:57,747 --> 00:52:00,079
We all want more
in our lives.

989
00:52:00,183 --> 00:52:01,480
That's to be expected.

990
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:02,574
Like taking the
foundation national,

991
00:52:02,686 --> 00:52:05,883
that's a big
deal, right?

992
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:06,978
Open you to a lot
of opportunities

993
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:08,955
television talk shows,
speaking engagements,

994
00:52:09,059 --> 00:52:15,294
a lot of money
in that.

995
00:52:15,398 --> 00:52:16,660
Why don't
you just ask me

996
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:18,631
what it is you really
want to know?

997
00:52:18,735 --> 00:52:20,032
Do you really believe
what you're selling?

998
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,105
Or you just trying to
make a name for yourself?

999
00:52:22,205 --> 00:52:25,231
You want to know if I
believe in what I do?

1000
00:52:25,342 --> 00:52:27,367
Unequivocally, yes.

1001
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:29,672
I'm here to change
lives, Kyle.

1002
00:52:29,779 --> 00:52:31,406
And, I know it works

1003
00:52:31,515 --> 00:52:32,982
because I've seen
it in action.

1004
00:52:33,083 --> 00:52:36,280
It didn't work
for Paul Hale.

1005
00:52:36,386 --> 00:52:38,320
Paul made
his own choices.

1006
00:52:38,421 --> 00:52:41,117
I heard you two
had a fight.

1007
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:43,715
We had a difference
of opinion.

1008
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:47,058
He wasn't thinking clearly,
he was disturbed.

1009
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,462
But he would
have come around.

1010
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:51,295
In time for next
week's fundraiser?

1011
00:52:51,401 --> 00:52:53,164
Paul was very
confused, Kyle.

1012
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:53,998
Maybe he was,

1013
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:54,934
but he was also
on every advertisement

1014
00:52:55,038 --> 00:52:56,403
for your foundation.

1015
00:52:56,506 --> 00:52:57,666
He was supposed to
announce his engagement

1016
00:52:57,774 --> 00:52:59,469
at your event.

1017
00:52:59,576 --> 00:53:01,203
You're not here for
treatment at all, are you?

1018
00:53:01,311 --> 00:53:02,938
You're a psychiatrist,
Dr. Cornell.

1019
00:53:03,046 --> 00:53:03,671
You prescribe meds.

1020
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:04,906
Do you know what happens
when alcohol is

1021
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:05,845
mixed with phenelzine?

1022
00:53:05,949 --> 00:53:07,246
Get out
of my office now!

1023
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:08,339
What happened
to Paul Hale?

1024
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:09,213
Did he have a relapse?

1025
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:09,944
Get out!

1026
00:53:10,053 --> 00:53:10,781
It doesn't look
too good

1027
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:11,945
if your poster boy
flies the coop!

1028
00:53:12,055 --> 00:53:13,386
Paul would have
never done that!

1029
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:15,355
That's exactly what
he did!

1030
00:53:15,458 --> 00:53:16,390
I bet it pissed
you off!

1031
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:17,687
You sure look
pissed now!

1032
00:53:17,794 --> 00:53:19,489
Get out and don't
come back!

1033
00:53:19,596 --> 00:53:21,188
What did you and two talk
about that night?

1034
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:22,196
Did you tell him it was
all going to be okay

1035
00:53:22,299 --> 00:53:23,323
while you poisoned him?!

1036
00:53:23,433 --> 00:53:24,695
Did you watch him twitch
and die on the floor?!

1037
00:53:24,801 --> 00:53:25,733
Did he cry for help?!

1038
00:53:25,835 --> 00:53:27,234
I loved Paul!

1039
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:28,929
Loved him!

1040
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:30,165
Trevor?

1041
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:33,336
What's going on?

1042
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:34,910
Get out!

1043
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:37,741
Get out before
I call the police.

1044
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:38,711
Oh, I'm pretty
sure the police

1045
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:40,339
will be calling you.

1046
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:44,111
What are you doing?

1047
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:45,210
My job.

1048
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:07,003
Shit!

1049
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:07,940
Don't move.

1050
00:54:08,044 --> 00:54:09,944
I've got a gun aimed at
the back of your head.

1051
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:12,014
Put your hands back
on the steering wheel.

1052
00:54:12,115 --> 00:54:13,241
Grey, take it easy.

1053
00:54:13,350 --> 00:54:13,941
Drive away.

1054
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:14,846
We can
talk about this.

1055
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:15,849
Just drive...

1056
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:31,764
what's this about,
grey?

1057
00:54:31,868 --> 00:54:33,062
I heard you
with Cornell.

1058
00:54:33,169 --> 00:54:36,161
He was pretty
angry, huh?

1059
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:38,264
I guess I was
saying things he
didn't wanna hear.

1060
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:39,307
About Paul Hale?

1061
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:41,707
That's exactly what
it was about.

1062
00:54:41,811 --> 00:54:43,244
What are we doing
here, grey?

1063
00:54:43,346 --> 00:54:44,313
They got in a fight,
you know?

1064
00:54:44,414 --> 00:54:45,540
Paul and Dr. Cornell

1065
00:54:45,649 --> 00:54:47,082
the other night
at group.

1066
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,317
I know.

1067
00:54:51,421 --> 00:54:56,358
Paul pushed Cornell and it
looked as if Dr. Cornell-

1068
00:54:56,459 --> 00:54:58,791
it looked like he
wanted to kill Paul.

1069
00:54:58,895 --> 00:55:00,260
You think he did?

1070
00:55:00,363 --> 00:55:03,730
I don't know... but the
thing is, when Paul left,

1071
00:55:03,833 --> 00:55:04,458
he grabbed his bag,

1072
00:55:04,567 --> 00:55:07,161
and some stuff
spilled out of it.

1073
00:55:07,270 --> 00:55:11,604
Paper, pens,

1074
00:55:11,708 --> 00:55:13,198
and this.

1075
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,938
I took it home
and watched it.

1076
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:17,138
I take it from
this conversation,

1077
00:55:17,247 --> 00:55:19,772
it wasn't pizza boy 3.

1078
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:23,319
I don't know who
you are,

1079
00:55:23,420 --> 00:55:28,050
but if you're here to find
out who killed Paul Hale.

1080
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:29,682
This will help.

1081
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:40,836
Grey...

1082
00:55:40,937 --> 00:55:44,703
I'm married.

1083
00:55:44,808 --> 00:55:46,503
Or at least as close
to it as two men can get

1084
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:49,669
in this country.

1085
00:55:49,779 --> 00:55:54,113
And more importantly,
I am in love with him.

1086
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:56,378
You're a nice guy.

1087
00:55:56,486 --> 00:55:59,114
You seem smart

1088
00:55:59,222 --> 00:56:04,421
and lord knows
you're good looking.

1089
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:07,860
Okay, so...

1090
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:11,229
so...

1091
00:56:11,334 --> 00:56:14,963
you're going to
get out of my car

1092
00:56:15,071 --> 00:56:20,771
and go home and you're going
to love that family of yours

1093
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:26,611
and somehow figure
out a way to be real.

1094
00:56:26,716 --> 00:56:29,276
Okay?

1095
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:30,853
Go.

1096
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:06,415
Hi.

1097
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:08,184
Where's Donald?

1098
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:09,724
I'm not
at liberty to say.

1099
00:57:09,826 --> 00:57:12,351
May I help you?

1100
00:57:12,462 --> 00:57:15,124
You must be
the new secretary.

1101
00:57:15,231 --> 00:57:16,858
Office manager.

1102
00:57:16,966 --> 00:57:18,729
And you are?

1103
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:20,063
I'm tim Callahan.

1104
00:57:22,138 --> 00:57:24,265
I'm sorry, did you
have an appointment?

1105
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:25,636
I'm Donald's partner.

1106
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:30,942
His boyfriend?

1107
00:57:31,047 --> 00:57:31,945
Oh, gosh!

1108
00:57:32,048 --> 00:57:33,515
I'm so sorry!

1109
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:34,412
It's nice
to meet you.

1110
00:57:34,517 --> 00:57:35,415
Pleasure.

1111
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:36,917
I feel like
a complete jerk,

1112
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,783
I should've
known your name,

1113
00:57:38,888 --> 00:57:42,619
I just didn't know
Donald was into older--

1114
00:57:42,725 --> 00:57:45,717
can I get
you a coffee?

1115
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:47,421
Kenny, we're going to--

1116
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:47,962
hey,

1117
00:57:48,064 --> 00:57:49,725
what're you doing here?

1118
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:52,495
The senator finished kissing
babies a little early today,

1119
00:57:52,602 --> 00:57:53,762
so I thought maybe
I could convince

1120
00:57:53,870 --> 00:57:55,599
Albany's cutest
private eye

1121
00:57:55,705 --> 00:57:57,070
to take me out
for a latte?

1122
00:57:57,173 --> 00:57:58,606
I know him,
he's a pushover...

1123
00:57:58,708 --> 00:57:59,766
five minutes,
have a seat.

1124
00:57:59,876 --> 00:58:01,503
Sure...

1125
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:02,236
at my age,

1126
00:58:02,345 --> 00:58:04,836
I should probably get
all rest as I can.

1127
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:05,846
Kenny, I need
you to do find

1128
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:07,280
everything we can on
the Cornell's kid,

1129
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:08,907
everything, where he
lives, what he does,

1130
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:09,712
all of it.

1131
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:10,683
Cornell kid,
got it.

1132
00:58:10,787 --> 00:58:12,687
And I did that check you
wanted on Walter Tidlow--

1133
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:13,721
Tidlow?

1134
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:15,347
As in Clifford
Tidlow, the developer?

1135
00:58:15,458 --> 00:58:16,447
Right.

1136
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:17,423
Apparently his son,
Walter,

1137
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:19,427
is going to inherit like
five million bucks-

1138
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:21,463
not anymore.

1139
00:58:21,564 --> 00:58:22,792
What do you mean?

1140
00:58:22,899 --> 00:58:26,835
The government seized
all his assets for tax fraud.

1141
00:58:26,936 --> 00:58:28,995
His estate tried to
get senator Glassman
to intervene,

1142
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:30,936
but there was nothing
we could do.

1143
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:32,405
He hasn't got
a dime.

1144
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:34,670
Wow, I wonder if Walter
knows he's wasting his time

1145
00:58:34,777 --> 00:58:36,369
playing it straight?

1146
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:37,707
I wonder if Levon knows
he's wasting his time

1147
00:58:37,814 --> 00:58:38,746
with Walter?

1148
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:39,815
Levon?

1149
00:58:39,916 --> 00:58:41,383
Walter's boyfr--

1150
00:58:41,484 --> 00:58:42,712
partner.

1151
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:47,220
You think Levon found
out about the money?

1152
00:58:47,323 --> 00:58:50,781
And maybe Levon decided
to find himself another

1153
00:58:50,894 --> 00:58:52,691
rich boyfriend--

1154
00:58:52,795 --> 00:58:54,194
like Paul Hale?

1155
00:58:54,297 --> 00:58:55,628
And then Walter found
out about Paul and--

1156
00:58:55,732 --> 00:58:56,994
Levon.

1157
00:58:57,100 --> 00:58:59,091
Levon, and put the
pills in Paul's drink?

1158
00:58:59,202 --> 00:58:59,725
That's it!

1159
00:58:59,836 --> 00:59:01,064
We solved it!

1160
00:59:02,305 --> 00:59:03,067
Good job, boys.

1161
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:04,503
Just a couple problems
with your theory.

1162
00:59:04,607 --> 00:59:06,973
One, Levon and Walter
were in group therapy

1163
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:09,670
at the exact time
of Paul's death.

1164
00:59:09,779 --> 00:59:10,803
And number two,

1165
00:59:10,914 --> 00:59:12,381
Paul wasn't just planning
to leave the group.

1166
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:13,710
He was planning to take
down the entire

1167
00:59:13,816 --> 00:59:15,408
Phoenix Foundation with him.

1168
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:18,046
...but the truth
turned out to be

1169
00:59:18,154 --> 00:59:19,143
something totally different.

1170
00:59:19,255 --> 00:59:22,691
I wanted to believe
I wanted to change.

1171
00:59:22,792 --> 00:59:25,454
And I did change, finally.

1172
00:59:25,562 --> 00:59:27,655
Just not in the way
I was expecting.

1173
00:59:27,764 --> 00:59:29,095
What is that?

1174
00:59:29,198 --> 00:59:31,962
The reason Paul
Hale was murdered.

1175
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,592
Have you called
Larry Phelps?

1176
00:59:33,703 --> 00:59:35,967
Yeah, and I've left like
six messages but nothing.

1177
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:37,130
I even contacted
his landlady

1178
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,037
but she hasn't
seen him all week.

1179
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:40,632
It's like
he's vanished.

1180
00:59:40,743 --> 00:59:43,405
He hasn't vanished.

1181
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:45,208
He's hiding.

1182
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:51,148
Is that him?

1183
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,915
Yeah.

1184
00:59:53,022 --> 00:59:55,183
This is why he
was so scared.

1185
00:59:55,291 --> 00:59:56,349
He knows whatever
Paul knew.

1186
00:59:56,459 --> 00:59:58,586
And whoever killed
Paul is after him now.

1187
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,758
Rain check?

1188
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:04,230
Rain check.

1189
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,086
I'm looking for a buddy
of mine, Larry Phelps,

1190
01:00:28,191 --> 01:00:29,249
you know him?

1191
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:31,293
Yeah... but
he's not here.

1192
01:00:31,394 --> 01:00:33,191
Nobody's seen
him all week.

1193
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,285
Of course.

1194
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:35,659
Well, he's got some
footage I need,

1195
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:37,824
any chance you
can show me where
he's been working?

1196
01:00:37,934 --> 01:00:42,337
Yeah, he was in here,
ten, twelve hours a day,

1197
01:00:42,438 --> 01:00:44,167
and he wouldn't let
anybody see what he
was doing either

1198
01:00:46,809 --> 01:00:47,901
that's strange.

1199
01:00:48,011 --> 01:00:49,569
What?

1200
01:00:49,679 --> 01:00:51,704
The hard drives
are gone.

1201
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,281
Maybe he was finished?

1202
01:00:53,383 --> 01:00:57,786
Yeah, but he wouldn't
take the hard drives
with him.

1203
01:00:57,887 --> 01:01:01,914
Okay, if you see
him, have him give
me a call, okay?

1204
01:01:04,060 --> 01:01:05,118
Donald Strachey.

1205
01:01:05,228 --> 01:01:06,388
Private investigator.

1206
01:01:06,496 --> 01:01:09,988
Hey... you're that
gay detective, right?

1207
01:01:10,099 --> 01:01:12,226
The one from
that magazine?

1208
01:01:12,335 --> 01:01:14,803
Does everybody
read that thing?

1209
01:01:14,904 --> 01:01:15,632
Listen to me,

1210
01:01:15,738 --> 01:01:17,968
find him, okay, tell him
I'm a friend of Paul's.

1211
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:18,904
That's important,
you got it?

1212
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:19,667
I'm a friend.

1213
01:01:19,776 --> 01:01:20,743
Yeah.

1214
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:23,311
Alright, I'll sign
your magazine.

1215
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:14,229
How many is that?

1216
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:16,230
One.

1217
01:02:16,332 --> 01:02:18,323
You haven't even
touched it yet?

1218
01:02:18,434 --> 01:02:19,594
I'm not in the mood.

1219
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:21,829
Uh-oh.

1220
01:02:21,938 --> 01:02:24,065
Wanna talk about it?

1221
01:02:24,173 --> 01:02:26,437
Just thinking.

1222
01:02:26,542 --> 01:02:31,502
With you, that's usually
not a good thing.

1223
01:02:31,614 --> 01:02:32,911
Do you ever wonder what
your life would be like

1224
01:02:33,015 --> 01:02:35,176
if you weren't gay?

1225
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:36,808
I hate it when you
do undercover work.

1226
01:02:36,919 --> 01:02:38,443
You're not actually
listening to this quack,
are you?

1227
01:02:38,554 --> 01:02:42,251
No, it's not
even about gay.

1228
01:02:42,358 --> 01:02:46,055
Don't you ever think how
things would be different?

1229
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:48,392
Not really.

1230
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:50,830
Come on,

1231
01:02:50,933 --> 01:02:53,128
what if you never been
kicked out of the seminary?

1232
01:02:53,236 --> 01:02:53,998
You loved it there.

1233
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,331
I did.

1234
01:02:55,438 --> 01:02:56,928
It felt like my calling.

1235
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:01,066
Alright then, you could be
in Africa or who knows where,

1236
01:03:01,177 --> 01:03:02,337
helping sick people.

1237
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:05,107
A lot of things would
be different.

1238
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:08,445
But just "different"
not necessarily better.

1239
01:03:08,551 --> 01:03:11,111
Maybe they would be.

1240
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:13,279
I wouldn't have you,

1241
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:18,292
so it could not
have been better.

1242
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:20,419
The gay detective.

1243
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:22,157
Private investigator.

1244
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:25,291
That's me.

1245
01:03:25,401 --> 01:03:28,234
That's what I've become.

1246
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:30,498
Only if that's how
you see yourself.

1247
01:03:34,777 --> 01:03:38,975
I'm cool with being
gay, you know that.

1248
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:40,309
But it's
ridiculous to say

1249
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:42,907
that it doesn't
change things,

1250
01:03:43,019 --> 01:03:46,182
doesn't affect
your options.

1251
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:47,779
Problem is not
being gay

1252
01:03:47,890 --> 01:03:50,484
it's other people,
ignorant people,

1253
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:54,654
telling you who you
can or can't be
because you're gay.

1254
01:03:54,764 --> 01:04:01,363
You never feel a little
bit trapped... a little?

1255
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:04,439
I wouldn't trade
my life with anyone.

1256
01:04:04,540 --> 01:04:07,065
I like my life.

1257
01:04:07,176 --> 01:04:08,473
I thought you did, too.

1258
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:09,602
Timothy...

1259
01:04:09,712 --> 01:04:10,906
I'm sorry if you
feel trapped.

1260
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:12,139
Tim...

1261
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,086
Strachey.

1262
01:04:19,188 --> 01:04:21,520
What?

1263
01:04:21,624 --> 01:04:27,392
Yeah, look, I'm busy
right now, can it wait?

1264
01:04:27,496 --> 01:04:28,854
Where are you?

1265
01:05:08,404 --> 01:05:10,167
It's you.

1266
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:13,834
I'd hate to be whoever
you thought I was...

1267
01:05:13,943 --> 01:05:18,004
sorry, it's just that...

1268
01:05:18,114 --> 01:05:21,675
things have been weird
since Paul died.

1269
01:05:21,784 --> 01:05:23,308
You don't believe he
killed himself either.

1270
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:24,181
No.

1271
01:05:24,287 --> 01:05:27,347
Those fuckers killed him.

1272
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:32,519
Which fuckers exactly
are we talking about?

1273
01:05:32,628 --> 01:05:34,789
The Phoenix Foundation,
who else?

1274
01:05:34,897 --> 01:05:36,728
That's the film you
and Paul were working on?

1275
01:05:36,832 --> 01:05:39,460
An expose of
the Phoenix Foundation.

1276
01:05:39,568 --> 01:05:41,399
It was Paul's movie.

1277
01:05:41,504 --> 01:05:44,598
He was gonna let the truth
about those assholes...

1278
01:05:44,707 --> 01:05:46,004
that's why they wiped
out his hard drive.

1279
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:48,042
He was storing
the film on his computer.

1280
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:52,547
Yeah, but he gave
me a backup copy.

1281
01:05:52,648 --> 01:05:54,377
I've been coming in here
working on it every night

1282
01:05:54,483 --> 01:05:56,007
after they close up.

1283
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:58,450
But I don't care
how long it takes,

1284
01:05:58,554 --> 01:05:59,851
I'm gonna finish
it for him

1285
01:05:59,956 --> 01:06:00,547
and I don't care

1286
01:06:00,656 --> 01:06:02,055
how many threatening
messages they leave.

1287
01:06:02,158 --> 01:06:03,682
Who's threatening you?

1288
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:07,893
I thought it was you.

1289
01:06:07,997 --> 01:06:08,520
That's why I ran,

1290
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:11,498
I thought you were
gonna beat me up.

1291
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:14,831
I only beat up
people who need it.

1292
01:06:14,937 --> 01:06:17,497
Who did they say they
are when they call you?

1293
01:06:17,606 --> 01:06:20,404
Lawyers, mostly, saying
they're gonna sue my ass

1294
01:06:20,509 --> 01:06:22,534
if there's anything
slanderous in the movie.

1295
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:24,237
How do they know
about the movie?

1296
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:25,905
I don't know,

1297
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:28,210
they might have found
the camera Paul hid-

1298
01:06:28,317 --> 01:06:30,080
there's a hidden camera?

1299
01:06:30,186 --> 01:06:33,917
Yeah, in Cornell's office.

1300
01:06:34,023 --> 01:06:36,890
Paul was filming
Dr. Cornell's
private sessions?

1301
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:39,052
For the last
three weeks, yeah.

1302
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:47,201
You're asking
me to do something

1303
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:49,134
I'm not comfortable with.

1304
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:50,899
Listen, Dr. Cornell,

1305
01:06:51,007 --> 01:06:53,737
all I need
you to do is tell him

1306
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,777
tell him I'm straight

1307
01:06:55,878 --> 01:06:59,211
but you're not, are you?

1308
01:06:59,315 --> 01:07:01,340
Are you?

1309
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:03,281
That's Walter Tidlow.

1310
01:07:03,386 --> 01:07:05,479
We're altering all
the voices,

1311
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:07,078
so the clients
stay anonymous.

1312
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:10,124
I can make this
worth your while

1313
01:07:10,226 --> 01:07:12,023
I'll inherit a lot.

1314
01:07:12,128 --> 01:07:14,562
I can make a donation
to Phoenix.

1315
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:15,322
Walter...

1316
01:07:15,431 --> 01:07:16,728
a big donation.

1317
01:07:16,832 --> 01:07:18,299
So anyone who knew Paul
was making this film

1318
01:07:18,401 --> 01:07:19,493
might've had
reason to kill him.

1319
01:07:20,903 --> 01:07:22,495
What the hell?

1320
01:07:22,605 --> 01:07:23,765
Stay here.

1321
01:07:27,910 --> 01:07:29,104
Fuck.

1322
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:35,842
Who's there?!

1323
01:07:43,092 --> 01:07:44,389
Identify yourself!

1324
01:07:58,741 --> 01:07:59,833
Larry?

1325
01:08:04,547 --> 01:08:05,275
Larry?

1326
01:08:06,715 --> 01:08:08,114
Oh!

1327
01:08:13,656 --> 01:08:15,055
Larry?

1328
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:41,983
Just keep
these guys back.

1329
01:08:42,084 --> 01:08:43,449
I'm gonna
need your gun.

1330
01:08:47,590 --> 01:08:49,148
You didn't get a good
look at the shooter?

1331
01:08:49,258 --> 01:08:50,919
I know who did it.

1332
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:52,050
This is a police
matter now.

1333
01:08:52,161 --> 01:08:55,619
It should've been
a long time ago.

1334
01:08:55,731 --> 01:08:57,323
You think this guy is
Trevor Cornell.

1335
01:08:57,433 --> 01:08:58,331
Come on, Bailey,

1336
01:08:58,434 --> 01:08:59,833
he tells me to my face
he was in love with Paul.

1337
01:08:59,935 --> 01:09:00,731
The kid was making movies

1338
01:09:00,836 --> 01:09:02,030
can destroy everything
he's working for,

1339
01:09:02,138 --> 01:09:03,196
what do you think?

1340
01:09:03,305 --> 01:09:05,205
We'll check him out,
see if he's got an alibi.

1341
01:09:05,307 --> 01:09:07,775
He's got a lot of people
that will lie for him.

1342
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:09,208
If this guy's involved

1343
01:09:09,311 --> 01:09:10,869
in the murders of Paul
Hale and Larry Phelps,

1344
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:12,242
I promise you

1345
01:09:12,348 --> 01:09:14,475
I will put
him behind bars.

1346
01:09:14,583 --> 01:09:18,383
I want you out of this,
do I make myself clear.

1347
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:20,284
Perfectly clear.

1348
01:09:28,130 --> 01:09:30,598
Yeah, wake up
Judge Frears

1349
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:32,564
I need a warrant.

1350
01:09:45,781 --> 01:09:48,011
Hi.

1351
01:09:48,117 --> 01:09:49,550
Hey.

1352
01:10:05,434 --> 01:10:06,992
I'm sorry.

1353
01:10:09,338 --> 01:10:09,963
Ahhh!

1354
01:10:10,072 --> 01:10:11,130
What...?

1355
01:10:11,240 --> 01:10:12,070
Oh my god...

1356
01:10:12,174 --> 01:10:13,402
it's nothing,
don't worry.

1357
01:10:13,509 --> 01:10:14,134
Donald...

1358
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:17,303
it barely hit me.

1359
01:10:17,413 --> 01:10:19,176
Nothing that
a couple of drinks
isn't going to fix.

1360
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:26,620
Should I ask
you about it?

1361
01:10:26,722 --> 01:10:29,418
No.

1362
01:10:29,525 --> 01:10:30,924
Because then I'd have
to tell you about it

1363
01:10:31,026 --> 01:10:34,189
and I just don't want to
talk about it right now...

1364
01:10:34,296 --> 01:10:36,787
well, then...

1365
01:10:39,134 --> 01:10:40,863
we won't
talk about it.

1366
01:10:49,812 --> 01:10:51,040
Who's that?

1367
01:10:56,685 --> 01:11:00,121
That's Kyle griffin.

1368
01:11:00,222 --> 01:11:02,053
My lieutenant.

1369
01:11:04,426 --> 01:11:06,291
The first man
I ever loved.

1370
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:11,360
You've never
mentioned him before.

1371
01:11:17,306 --> 01:11:21,902
He saved my life.

1372
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:28,382
We were caught
in a ambush, snipers,
and I got hit.

1373
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:29,382
Right, the scar
on your back.

1374
01:11:29,485 --> 01:11:30,918
Yeah.

1375
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:36,755
Kyle came running
back for me,

1376
01:11:36,859 --> 01:11:38,349
he won the medal
of honor for that.

1377
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:40,223
He was a hero.

1378
01:11:40,329 --> 01:11:41,762
You two were a couple?

1379
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:51,473
It was crazy,

1380
01:11:51,573 --> 01:11:56,442
trying to have
a relationship in the army

1381
01:11:56,545 --> 01:12:00,106
all the secret
hiding places,

1382
01:12:00,215 --> 01:12:04,777
the long
meaningful glances.

1383
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:07,048
Always afraid somebody was
gonna find out about us.

1384
01:12:12,728 --> 01:12:15,697
Sounds horrible.

1385
01:12:15,798 --> 01:12:16,924
Yeah.

1386
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:23,968
I don't know.

1387
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:31,775
I tried to run
so long for being gay

1388
01:12:31,880 --> 01:12:35,372
and there I was,

1389
01:12:35,484 --> 01:12:41,787
a soldier,
in love with a man,

1390
01:12:41,890 --> 01:12:45,724
and I was happy.

1391
01:12:45,828 --> 01:12:49,423
How long?

1392
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:54,059
Four months.

1393
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:57,036
And then they dragged
him by the cid,

1394
01:12:57,139 --> 01:12:58,436
they separated us,

1395
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:01,168
and asked us questions
about our "relationship."

1396
01:13:01,276 --> 01:13:02,504
I thought they weren't
supposed to ask

1397
01:13:02,611 --> 01:13:04,875
and you weren't
supposed to tell.

1398
01:13:04,980 --> 01:13:06,140
Just because a rule
exists doesn't mean

1399
01:13:06,248 --> 01:13:09,445
the army has
to follow it.

1400
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:11,382
So what did you do?

1401
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:21,321
I told the truth.

1402
01:13:21,430 --> 01:13:25,366
I don't even know why.

1403
01:13:25,467 --> 01:13:26,866
It wasn't like
I was all of a sudden

1404
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:28,368
all excited
about being gay,

1405
01:13:28,470 --> 01:13:31,962
I just...

1406
01:13:32,074 --> 01:13:35,942
I just loved him

1407
01:13:36,044 --> 01:13:38,274
and it didn't seem
right to lie about that.

1408
01:13:45,020 --> 01:13:50,219
And from that moment,
everything changed.

1409
01:13:50,325 --> 01:13:56,457
I lost everything,
I lost my career,

1410
01:13:56,565 --> 01:14:05,997
all my friends,
all my dreams.

1411
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:07,803
And what about Kyle?

1412
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:27,151
He hated me.

1413
01:14:27,262 --> 01:14:32,632
He wouldn't talk to me.

1414
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:34,599
The day we got
our discharges,

1415
01:14:34,703 --> 01:14:36,898
he put a gun
in his mouth.

1416
01:14:37,005 --> 01:14:39,371
Oh, no,

1417
01:14:39,475 --> 01:14:42,137
oh, no,

1418
01:14:42,244 --> 01:14:44,439
oh, baby.

1419
01:15:01,864 --> 01:15:03,889
...this morning with the
arrest of Dr. Trevor Cornell,

1420
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:06,092
a prominent psychiatrist
whose controversial

1421
01:15:06,201 --> 01:15:08,897
conversion therapy
has drawn sharp criticism

1422
01:15:09,004 --> 01:15:11,097
within the gay
and lesbian community.

1423
01:15:11,206 --> 01:15:13,731
Now, Dr. Cornell is expected
to be charged with the murder

1424
01:15:13,842 --> 01:15:16,037
of Larry Phelps, a local
university student

1425
01:15:16,144 --> 01:15:17,805
gunned down last night.

1426
01:15:17,913 --> 01:15:19,073
And maybe we'll get
him for Paul Hale, too.

1427
01:15:19,181 --> 01:15:20,307
Authorities reportedly
found the murder weapon

1428
01:15:20,415 --> 01:15:22,645
inside Cornell's office
in his Phoenix Foundation

1429
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:23,775
headquarters.

1430
01:15:23,886 --> 01:15:25,979
Kelsey Thomas, WXRN News.

1431
01:15:33,996 --> 01:15:36,692
They found the gun
in his office?

1432
01:15:36,798 --> 01:15:39,164
Isn't that
a little... convenient?

1433
01:15:39,268 --> 01:15:41,429
Convenient?

1434
01:15:41,537 --> 01:15:44,472
Well, you said so
yourself he was smart.

1435
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:47,064
So he goes and
kills somebody

1436
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:50,611
and puts the gun
in the office?

1437
01:15:50,712 --> 01:15:55,172
Gimme some more coffee?

1438
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:56,808
And what made Paul Hale
pick a fight with him

1439
01:15:56,919 --> 01:15:58,682
at that group session
in the first place?

1440
01:15:58,787 --> 01:16:01,881
I mean, the guy was going
to blindside him with that

1441
01:16:01,990 --> 01:16:06,324
film he was making
the following week.

1442
01:16:06,428 --> 01:16:07,520
And what about
Lynne Cornell,

1443
01:16:07,629 --> 01:16:10,689
she's got as much to
lose as her husband does.

1444
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:13,495
Don't you have something
political to do?

1445
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:16,469
I'm just saying,
the don Strachey I know

1446
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:18,403
wouldn't just accept
the obvious.

1447
01:16:22,778 --> 01:16:24,746
You'd like to believe
he was guilty...

1448
01:16:49,004 --> 01:16:51,165
geez, you're never satisfied,
are you, Strachey?

1449
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:52,069
Just give me
a couple minutes.

1450
01:16:52,174 --> 01:16:53,141
We've got him cold.

1451
01:16:53,241 --> 01:16:54,868
The gun was found locked
in his desk drawer.

1452
01:16:54,977 --> 01:16:56,467
Along with several
capsules of phenelzine.

1453
01:16:56,578 --> 01:16:58,375
And he's got
no alibi says he was
alone in his office

1454
01:16:58,480 --> 01:16:59,412
at the time
of the shooting.

1455
01:16:59,514 --> 01:17:00,503
Isn't that
a little "convenient."

1456
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:01,640
I thought you'd
be ecstatic.

1457
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:02,739
So did I.

1458
01:17:02,851 --> 01:17:03,818
He's in the holding cell
until they get here

1459
01:17:03,919 --> 01:17:05,079
to take him over
to county.

1460
01:17:14,396 --> 01:17:15,988
You did this to me.

1461
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:18,123
I'd say you did it
to yourself.

1462
01:17:18,233 --> 01:17:19,564
I'm being framed.

1463
01:17:19,668 --> 01:17:22,102
Okay, who framed you?

1464
01:17:22,204 --> 01:17:24,104
Someone who didn't want
to see my work succeed.

1465
01:17:24,206 --> 01:17:25,468
Probably someone
like you.

1466
01:17:25,574 --> 01:17:29,169
You're right it was me,
I'll go home now.

1467
01:17:29,277 --> 01:17:32,246
What about your alibi?

1468
01:17:32,347 --> 01:17:35,282
I was alone.

1469
01:17:35,384 --> 01:17:36,749
Nobody saw you?

1470
01:17:36,852 --> 01:17:39,650
No.

1471
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:42,315
Believe me I could
never shoot anyone.

1472
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:44,654
How about poison them?

1473
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:47,854
A little phenelzine bourbon
combo, something like that.

1474
01:17:47,963 --> 01:17:52,832
I would never hurt Paul.

1475
01:17:52,934 --> 01:17:56,597
You tell me
you loved him.

1476
01:17:56,705 --> 01:17:58,434
Did he love you back?

1477
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:02,501
Of course, you'd
think that!

1478
01:18:02,611 --> 01:18:05,512
Turn it into something
deviant and unnatural!

1479
01:18:05,614 --> 01:18:07,844
Well, what was it then?

1480
01:18:07,949 --> 01:18:09,746
I loved Paul like a son!

1481
01:18:13,822 --> 01:18:16,347
Like the son I lost...

1482
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:17,823
lost?

1483
01:18:19,294 --> 01:18:23,094
My son Andrew died
four years ago.

1484
01:18:23,198 --> 01:18:23,994
An accident.

1485
01:18:24,099 --> 01:18:25,464
What kind of accident?

1486
01:18:25,567 --> 01:18:28,001
He was drunk.

1487
01:18:28,103 --> 01:18:30,162
He was drunk a lot.

1488
01:18:30,272 --> 01:18:34,732
No matter how many
times we tried
to get him help...

1489
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:35,332
I'm sorry.

1490
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:36,138
I thought-

1491
01:18:36,244 --> 01:18:37,643
you thought what?

1492
01:18:37,746 --> 01:18:38,610
Paul hired me to
find somebody,

1493
01:18:38,714 --> 01:18:41,444
I thought maybe
it was your son.

1494
01:18:41,550 --> 01:18:45,646
Paul knew my son
was dead.

1495
01:18:45,754 --> 01:18:53,286
We talked about our
families a lot.

1496
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:55,363
Tell me about
the night

1497
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:57,591
the big blow-up
with Paul,

1498
01:18:57,699 --> 01:19:00,361
how did it get started,
what happened?

1499
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:01,401
I don't know.

1500
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:03,801
I'm trying to help
you here...

1501
01:19:03,905 --> 01:19:05,167
I don't know!

1502
01:19:05,273 --> 01:19:07,969
He came out of nowhere.

1503
01:19:08,076 --> 01:19:09,543
Paul had been distant
for several weeks.

1504
01:19:09,644 --> 01:19:11,669
I tried to talk to him-

1505
01:19:11,780 --> 01:19:15,978
you can't think
of anything that
set him off that day?

1506
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:21,078
I didn't even
see him until he
came into the group.

1507
01:19:21,189 --> 01:19:23,282
Who else did you
see that day?

1508
01:19:23,391 --> 01:19:24,551
A lot of people.

1509
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:25,626
In individual sessions.

1510
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:30,391
Did you have
individual sessions?

1511
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:34,595
Uhm, yes... I saw
Walter and Katie

1512
01:19:34,703 --> 01:19:36,170
in the afternoon.

1513
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:40,105
And grey, right
before group.

1514
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:41,038
Okay.

1515
01:19:41,143 --> 01:19:41,734
Where are you going?

1516
01:19:41,843 --> 01:19:43,174
Are you going to help
me or not?

1517
01:19:44,446 --> 01:19:45,811
Unfortunately.

1518
01:19:59,895 --> 01:20:00,691
Leave us alone!

1519
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,957
Open the door.

1520
01:20:03,064 --> 01:20:04,395
Haven't you
done enough?

1521
01:20:04,499 --> 01:20:06,467
I can help
your husband.

1522
01:20:06,568 --> 01:20:08,331
Go to hell!

1523
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:09,334
Your husband's
about to go to prison

1524
01:20:09,437 --> 01:20:10,597
for a murder
he didn't commit.

1525
01:20:10,705 --> 01:20:13,538
Whatever you think of me,
I'm the best chance he's got.

1526
01:20:19,915 --> 01:20:22,179
Trevor's a good man.

1527
01:20:22,284 --> 01:20:23,751
Yeah, he's a real peach.

1528
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:34,455
What are you doing?

1529
01:20:38,133 --> 01:20:39,157
That was a gift.

1530
01:20:42,871 --> 01:20:44,168
A gift from Paul?

1531
01:20:44,272 --> 01:20:45,637
Yes, a few weeks ago.

1532
01:20:49,311 --> 01:20:51,211
Trevor was the star
of Paul's new movie.

1533
01:20:53,615 --> 01:20:56,083
We heard he was
making a film, but
this is immoral.

1534
01:20:56,184 --> 01:20:57,446
I can't believe
Paul would do this.

1535
01:20:57,552 --> 01:20:58,348
Well, he did.

1536
01:20:58,453 --> 01:20:59,579
And whoever killed Paul,
knew he was doing it.

1537
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:02,521
They killed
Larry Phelps and wiped
out all the footage.

1538
01:21:02,624 --> 01:21:03,648
It's on a motion sensor.

1539
01:21:03,758 --> 01:21:05,749
It was filming every
time there was movement
in this office.

1540
01:21:05,861 --> 01:21:06,793
My god...

1541
01:21:06,895 --> 01:21:08,487
has a wireless
transmitter and
was sending images

1542
01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:09,495
to a computer.

1543
01:21:09,598 --> 01:21:11,896
It has to be close,
a hundred feet or so.

1544
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:12,728
My office.

1545
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:13,994
Paul was helping with
the marketing materials

1546
01:21:14,102 --> 01:21:15,296
for the national launch.

1547
01:21:30,218 --> 01:21:30,912
He was probably
downloading

1548
01:21:31,019 --> 01:21:32,577
every time he came in.

1549
01:21:32,687 --> 01:21:33,551
But the last time
he was in was during

1550
01:21:33,655 --> 01:21:35,179
the group session.

1551
01:21:35,290 --> 01:21:36,222
So there should
be a few days worth
of home movies

1552
01:21:36,324 --> 01:21:38,884
waiting for us.

1553
01:21:38,994 --> 01:21:40,393
Trevor was in his office
during the shooting

1554
01:21:40,495 --> 01:21:42,395
this would prove
to the police he
was really there,

1555
01:21:42,497 --> 01:21:43,691
if he's telling
the truth, yeah.

1556
01:21:47,602 --> 01:21:52,005
We'll do a search for
any large movie files...

1557
01:21:52,107 --> 01:21:53,267
there they are...

1558
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:55,070
Trevor was telling
the truth, you'll see.

1559
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:29,435
Well, he was telling
half the truth,

1560
01:22:29,544 --> 01:22:31,205
he was in his office.

1561
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:33,838
That stupid Hale is
starting to suspect something,

1562
01:22:33,949 --> 01:22:35,177
I think he knows

1563
01:22:35,283 --> 01:22:37,217
our big wedding
announcement is bullshit.

1564
01:22:37,319 --> 01:22:39,787
You need to tell your wife
you want a divorce now!

1565
01:22:39,888 --> 01:22:41,355
It's not that easy.

1566
01:22:41,456 --> 01:22:42,650
You think
it was easy for me

1567
01:22:42,757 --> 01:22:44,224
playing a dike for
the past six months,

1568
01:22:44,326 --> 01:22:47,159
so everyone will believe
your program really works!

1569
01:22:47,262 --> 01:22:48,854
Just a bit longer.

1570
01:22:48,964 --> 01:22:50,090
It will all be over soon.

1571
01:22:50,198 --> 01:22:53,656
If you don't do
something, I will.

1572
01:22:56,705 --> 01:22:57,729
Katie...

1573
01:22:57,839 --> 01:22:59,033
why couldn't you
leave it alone?!

1574
01:22:59,140 --> 01:22:59,731
Take it easy.

1575
01:22:59,841 --> 01:23:00,398
Shut up!

1576
01:23:00,508 --> 01:23:01,975
Shut the fuck up!

1577
01:23:02,077 --> 01:23:04,307
Who are you going to
blame this one on, Katie?

1578
01:23:04,412 --> 01:23:05,811
Cornell's in jail.

1579
01:23:05,914 --> 01:23:07,882
I was practically raised
in a fire department

1580
01:23:07,983 --> 01:23:09,541
nobody'll ever know what
really happened in here

1581
01:23:09,651 --> 01:23:10,845
after I'm done.

1582
01:23:10,952 --> 01:23:12,613
That's it, huh?

1583
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:15,622
Paul found out what
was going on with
you and Cornell,

1584
01:23:15,724 --> 01:23:17,885
he believed anything I told
him right to the end.

1585
01:23:17,993 --> 01:23:21,690
Don't... move!

1586
01:23:21,796 --> 01:23:24,458
The only person I was
in love with was Trevor.

1587
01:23:24,566 --> 01:23:26,693
All of this was
for Trevor.

1588
01:23:26,801 --> 01:23:28,291
So why did you set
him up for murder?

1589
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:29,927
I needed to show him know
who was in control.

1590
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:52,657
Fucking great program
you run here, lady.

1591
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:11,937
Trevor!

1592
01:24:13,381 --> 01:24:14,370
Trevor?

1593
01:24:16,217 --> 01:24:18,014
You prick!

1594
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:23,858
Lynne...

1595
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:27,293
I believed in you.

1596
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:28,259
How could you?

1597
01:24:28,363 --> 01:24:29,387
Lynne.

1598
01:24:35,904 --> 01:24:39,772
I suppose you
enjoy this.

1599
01:24:39,874 --> 01:24:42,138
Two kids died
because of your lies

1600
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:45,076
there's nothing
here to enjoy.

1601
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:47,114
Strachey you're bleeding

1602
01:24:47,215 --> 01:24:48,204
you must love your job

1603
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:50,716
to keep coming
back for more.

1604
01:24:50,819 --> 01:24:53,413
It's a living.

1605
01:24:53,521 --> 01:24:54,886
You know, I still
don't have any
idea what the hell

1606
01:24:54,989 --> 01:24:57,082
I was hired for

1607
01:24:57,192 --> 01:24:59,592
no idea who Paul
wanted me to find.

1608
01:24:59,694 --> 01:25:03,630
I do.

1609
01:25:03,731 --> 01:25:06,598
I know who Paul
wanted you to find.

1610
01:25:10,638 --> 01:25:13,835
The invitation list
for the sisters
of mercy ball

1611
01:25:13,942 --> 01:25:15,409
isn't in this file.

1612
01:25:15,510 --> 01:25:16,909
You lied to me,
Mrs. Hale.

1613
01:25:19,214 --> 01:25:23,674
Find it.

1614
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:24,843
Detective Bailey called.

1615
01:25:24,953 --> 01:25:28,411
He said you'd found
the woman that
killed my son.

1616
01:25:28,523 --> 01:25:30,218
I did.

1617
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:34,554
I knew Paul wouldn't
kill himself.

1618
01:25:34,662 --> 01:25:38,063
He had too much
to live for.

1619
01:25:38,166 --> 01:25:41,567
But you weren't
certain, were you?

1620
01:25:41,669 --> 01:25:45,366
You were pretty hard on
him for being gay.

1621
01:25:45,473 --> 01:25:50,604
I loved my son more than
anything in the world.

1622
01:25:50,712 --> 01:25:53,476
I gave Paul everything.

1623
01:25:53,581 --> 01:25:57,108
Everything except
his father.

1624
01:25:57,218 --> 01:25:59,277
His father went away
a long time ago.

1625
01:25:59,387 --> 01:26:02,720
Went away,
or sent away?

1626
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:06,191
That's what you
told Dr. Cornell.

1627
01:26:06,294 --> 01:26:08,387
That your husband
was cheating on you
with another man.

1628
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:11,124
You kicked him out
and cut him off
from ever

1629
01:26:11,232 --> 01:26:12,756
seeing his son again.

1630
01:26:12,867 --> 01:26:14,596
He chose that
way of life.

1631
01:26:14,702 --> 01:26:17,830
And you couldn't handle
that, could you?

1632
01:26:17,939 --> 01:26:20,533
You told Paul his father
walked out on both of you,

1633
01:26:20,642 --> 01:26:21,609
that he didn't care
about his family.

1634
01:26:21,709 --> 01:26:23,267
You taught him to
hate his father.

1635
01:26:26,981 --> 01:26:30,109
Your son discovered
the truth.

1636
01:26:30,218 --> 01:26:33,847
How?

1637
01:26:33,955 --> 01:26:38,415
Dr. Cornell told him.

1638
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:40,619
He thought it
would reinforce

1639
01:26:40,728 --> 01:26:42,093
Paul's desire
to be straight.

1640
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,893
But it backfired on him.

1641
01:26:44,999 --> 01:26:46,489
All of a sudden
Paul didn't feel
like the freak

1642
01:26:46,601 --> 01:26:49,069
he was led
to believe he was.

1643
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:52,901
I never made him feel
he was a freak.

1644
01:26:53,007 --> 01:26:57,910
He was my
son... my child...

1645
01:26:58,012 --> 01:27:02,244
you pushed him into
the Phoenix Foundation,

1646
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:05,148
every day they
reinforced an idea
that you gave him,

1647
01:27:05,253 --> 01:27:06,982
that he wasn't
good enough.

1648
01:27:07,088 --> 01:27:07,782
That he'd only be happy

1649
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:09,379
if he was anything
other than what he was,

1650
01:27:09,490 --> 01:27:10,923
gay.

1651
01:27:17,098 --> 01:27:21,034
I thought it was
for the best,

1652
01:27:21,135 --> 01:27:25,595
I did.

1653
01:27:25,707 --> 01:27:27,971
I never imagined...

1654
01:27:35,116 --> 01:27:37,346
I just wanted him
to be happy.

1655
01:27:43,057 --> 01:27:45,048
I think that's all
Paul wanted, too.

1656
01:28:05,947 --> 01:28:10,384
So I've been thinking,

1657
01:28:10,485 --> 01:28:13,818
I thought we agreed
we weren't going to
do that any more.

1658
01:28:13,921 --> 01:28:15,980
No, we agreed that you
would stop thinking,

1659
01:28:16,090 --> 01:28:17,990
I'm allowed.

1660
01:28:18,092 --> 01:28:19,081
Thank you.

1661
01:28:19,193 --> 01:28:20,319
You're welcome.

1662
01:28:26,768 --> 01:28:29,202
I have an answer
to your question.

1663
01:28:29,304 --> 01:28:32,000
Did I ask a question?

1664
01:28:32,106 --> 01:28:33,095
How my life would
be different,

1665
01:28:33,207 --> 01:28:35,175
if I hadn't been gay?

1666
01:28:35,276 --> 01:28:37,335
That question.

1667
01:28:37,445 --> 01:28:39,470
Only I've turned
it around a bit.

1668
01:28:39,580 --> 01:28:41,480
How my life would
be different

1669
01:28:41,582 --> 01:28:43,072
if I hadn't met you?

1670
01:28:43,184 --> 01:28:45,414
Why don't I like
where this is going?

1671
01:28:45,520 --> 01:28:47,112
First, I would know
virtually nothing

1672
01:28:47,221 --> 01:28:49,485
about gunshot wounds.

1673
01:28:49,590 --> 01:28:50,750
Disastrous.

1674
01:28:50,858 --> 01:28:53,952
Second, I most likely
never have been kidnapped

1675
01:28:54,062 --> 01:28:55,029
nor had my life
threatened.

1676
01:28:55,129 --> 01:28:55,788
And third...

1677
01:28:55,897 --> 01:28:56,556
okay, okay.

1678
01:28:56,664 --> 01:28:57,426
And third--

1679
01:29:01,736 --> 01:29:03,135
Finished?

1680
01:29:03,237 --> 01:29:04,261
I haven't even
begun to start.

1681
01:29:04,372 --> 01:29:05,396
Come here, Sparky...
