{260}{315}(Polanski)|Of Ben-Hur, you mean?
{317}{360}(James)|Granted that it's too easy and a cliché
{363}{458}to connect your work with your life|in such a direct manner.
{460}{498}Let me take the example|of Chinatown.
{500}{585}Chinatown is really a movie|about justice not winning.
{588}{641}Is that what you had come|to believe?
{644}{672}(Polanski)|No, not at all.
{674}{730}But if you want your film|to serve any purpose,
{733}{824}if you want to show injustice|or corruption of Los Angeles
{827}{858}in that period,
{860}{957}you have to show|that injustice somehow won
{960}{1118}and leave them with a feeling|of frustration.
{1120}{1172}I hope you don't mind|if I just reach across here
{1175}{1223}and grab a couple of these... -|of these nuts.
{1225}{1260}I will too.
{1262}{1336}Anyway, that's... - that's fiction.
{1338}{1393}And I think this probably may be|still in the land of fiction,
{1396}{1417}edging towards fact.
{1420}{1511}When the... -|when the newspapers
{1513}{1552}and the magazines|and the books
{1554}{1646}talk about you|and little girls,
{1648}{1682}is there anything in it?
{1684}{1763}Well, I-I like young women... -|let's put it this way... -
{1765}{1824}and I think most of men do, actually.
{1826}{1854}Yeah, but the question... -
{1856}{1905}the question turns|on how young, doesn't it?
{1908}{2037}Well, yes, well, here you come|to a concrete case
{2040}{2069}for which I have been
{2072}{2112}behind bars.
{2115}{2163}And that's what you want|to talk about.
{2198}{2294}But what exactly would you|like me to tell you?
{2296}{2366}[Haunting vocal music]
{2669}{2741}[voices overlapping]
{2849}{2891}(man)|The Los Angeles|police department today
{2894}{2962}announced the arrest|of Raymond Polanski
{2965}{3009}as a result of a complaint filed
{3012}{3126}by the mother|of a 13-year-old female.
{3129}{3225}(Polanski)|It was a year of anxiety,|a year of drama for me,
{3228}{3288}and I thought it was|simply enough.
{3290}{3422}Enough is enough,|and that was my decision to leave.
{3424}{3492}You ran away, Roman.
{3494}{3522}You ran away.
{3524}{3622}Well, I, as you say, ran away
{3626}{3742}because I think|that I was very unfortunate
{3744}{3891}to have a judge|who misused justice.
{3894}{4025}And he was playing with me|for a period of a year.
{4027}{4149}I think that I was|some kind of mouse
{4151}{4356}with which some abominable cat|begins a sport.
{4359}{4430}[People shouting]
{5039}{5077}(Braunsberg)|People were not in the habit
{5079}{5133}of calling me|at 2:00 in the morning.
{5135}{5202}So I was sleeping.
{5317}{5346}I picked up the phone,
{5348}{5431}and they said,|"Roman's been arrested."
{5434}{5475}And I said, "What for?"
{5478}{5523}And they said, "Rape."
{5526}{5555}I said, "l-l... -
{5558}{5623}I just could not... -|it just made no sense.
{5626}{5726}I mean, this is somebody who|could not be a rapist, you know?
{5728}{5846}I mean, it's somebody I know|really, really well.
{5894}{5954}(Vannatter)|I was working|West L.A. Homicide,
{5957}{6011}and I also handled sex crimes.
{6013}{6101}And I came into work|and had a crime report on my desk
{6103}{6191}of a-a rape|that had been reported,
{6195}{6264}and Roman Polanski|was the named suspect in it.
{6267}{6331}After I received the report,|I started the follow-up.
{6335}{6417}I went to interview the victim|and her mother,
{6420}{6485}did an extensive interview|with them,
{6487}{6563}made sure that... -|that any physical evidence
{6565}{6627}would have been recovered|from her, that she had,
{6630}{6712}and then I-I went and talked|to the district attorney's office.
{6715}{6787}Vannatter came into the office,|and we sat down,
{6790}{6817}and he ran the case by me.
{6819}{6861}He showed me|the incident report,
{6863}{6947}a crime report taken|by a couple of patrol officers,
{6949}{7023}which is a narrative|of the facts and stuff.
{9988}{10060}Time was kind of of the essence,|so we got the search warrant,
{10062}{10108}and it was for two locations.
{10110}{10206}It was for Jack Nicholson's house,|where the crime occurred,
{10209}{10286}and also for Polanski's suite
{10288}{10380}on the second floor|of the Beverly Wilshire Hotel.
{10382}{10469}(Vannatter)|Me and my partner|along with a narcotics officer
{10471}{10537}proceeded with|the search warrant to the hotel.
{10540}{10573}(Grodin)|We were walking in,
{10575}{10616}and he was walking out|with a group of people,
{10618}{10662}obviously going out|for the evening.
{10665}{10696}And I told Phil.
{10698}{10769}I said, "There he is."
{10771}{10840}And we stopped, 'cause he would have|walked right on by us.
{10842}{10941}So we said, "Mr. Polanski, LAPD.|We have to talk."
{10943}{10967}And he came out, and he says,
{10969}{11006}"Is this gonna be|more than a few minutes?
{11008}{11046}If it is, I'll let my people go."
{11049}{11126}He says, "Yes, it's going to be|more than a few minutes."
{11128}{11154}We proceeded up to his room
{11156}{11189}and completed|the search warrant,
{11191}{11256}which we did find|the camera equipment,
{11258}{11345}the film that we ultimately|had developed, and... -
{11347}{11420}and it did show nude pictures|of the victim.
{11422}{11446}(woman)|Totally nude?
{11449}{11515}Well, she was in a... -|she was in a spa.
{11517}{11575}You could see|the upper portion of her body.
{11578}{11658}You couldn't see her whole body,|because she was in the water,
{11661}{11727}but they were nude pictures.
{11730}{11751}Polanski was nervous.
{11754}{11781}He was upset.
{11783}{11844}And he's one of those people|that just talk.
{11846}{11931}And I suspect he figures,|"Well, if I talk and talk,
{11933}{11979}I can probably talk my way|out of this thing."
{11981}{12045}He was, like, on a hyper high,
{12047}{12138}and he's constantly talking,|constantly fidgeting.
{12141}{12192}And he... - he didn't perceive
{12194}{12265}having intercourse|with a 13-year-old girl
{12268}{12293}as against the law.
{12295}{12366}That... - that was not|in his culture, that... -
{12369}{12422}you know, "So what?" type thing.
{12425}{12462}He didn't... - he didn't realize, I guess,
{12465}{12579}the laws of our country|as compared to other countries.
{12581}{12682}I'm not so sure|that Mr. Polanski was aware
{12684}{12752}of what being arrested|in America meant.
{13026}{13097}[Camera shutters clicking]
{13156}{13227}[Voices overlapping]
{13811}{13874}(Polanski)|I know it's a very nice|piece of news for all of you.
{13877}{13921}It's a lot of sensational stuff.
{13923}{13998}But try to go beyond|and understand my position.
{14000}{14042}It's not the best type|of publicity,
{14045}{14075}not something I desire.
{14078}{14146}I have not much to tell you|except that I am innocent.
{14148}{14198}Thank you.
{14303}{14343}(Brenneman)|When the case arrived here,
{14346}{14406}there was an absolute mob|of publicity,
{14409}{14491}the Associated Press, UPI,|New York Times,
{14494}{14563}Los Angeles Times,|celebrity mags,
{14565}{14612}German reporters,|French reporters,
{14614}{14659}British reporters.
{14662}{14751}I had never seen a media|feeding frenzy before,
{14754}{14815}and this courtroom embodied it.
{14818}{14861}You couldn't meet anybody,
{14863}{14924}whether he was known|or not known at all,
{14926}{14972}who didn't have an opinion|about this case.
{14974}{15044}And it was|one of the biggest cases.
{15046}{15107}I didn't work|for weeks and months
{15109}{15193}on anything else but this case.
{15264}{15362}(Brenneman)|As the case progressed,|I was struck... -
{15364}{15447}you know, how could this same man|be two different things
{15449}{15482}to two different sets of press?
{15484}{15569}The European reporters|looked on Polanski
{15571}{15671}as this tragic, brilliant,|historic figure.
{15674}{15760}Here was this man who had|survived the Holocaust,
{15763}{15837}who had survived|the gassing of his mother
{15839}{15938}and then had come here|and developed his own voice,
{15941}{15980}had maintained his integrity
{15982}{16040}against the power|of the Hollywood machine.
{16043}{16119}And the American press|tended to look at him
{16122}{16185}as this sort of malignant,|twisted dwarf
{16187}{16213}with this dark vision.
{16254}{16320}(Melnick)|Roman was the perfect villain for them.
{16322}{16364}He was a foreigner.
{16366}{16398}He had a thick accent.
{16401}{16471}He made lots of money|in the movie business.
{16473}{16507}He was short.|He was perfect.
{16509}{16633}In California at that time,|had he not been who he was,
{16635}{16737}in other words,|a famous controversial director
{16740}{16896}with the legacy|of his wife's murder behind him,
{16899}{16986}the whole thing would have been|completely different.
{17245}{17304}(man)|Roman Polanski is 32.
{17306}{17359}He has just completed|his fourth feature film,
{17361}{17396}The Vampire Killers,
{17398}{17460}set in the snow-covered|mountains of Transylvania.
{17462}{17565}He both directs and plays|one of the leading parts.
{17843}{17903}(Polanski)|Hold it, boys.
{17905}{17942}Sharon.
{17947}{18004}Sharon.
{18007}{18085}Looking at him,|not at me, okay?
{18087}{18118}Yeah.
{18120}{18152}You know where.
{18250}{18333}(man)|Roman Polanski was born|in France of Polish parents.
{18336}{18370}They left there|when he was three
{18373}{18408}and went to live in Poland.
{18410}{18514}I don't know.|I think I'm a nomad, you know.
{18517}{18696}But l... - I'm really strongly|attached to Polish background.
{18698}{18733}I've grown up in Poland.
{18735}{18845}My mother was killed by Germans|very soon,
{18848}{18933}and my father was taken|to the concentration camp
{18936}{19014}after two years of war,|and then I was by myself.
{19017}{19062}One of the first film... -
{19065}{19158}films I've seen was Snow White,|you know?
{19161}{19277}And I think it influenced me|enormously forever.
{19280}{19338}And... - and I, as you see,
{19341}{19459}it's enormous influence of this|in my work, like Repulsion
{19461}{19491}or, you know, Cul-de-sac.
{19598}{19669}I always wanted|to be a director.
{19671}{19708}I knew I wanted to make movies.
{19710}{19766}I knew I wanted|to be a part of it.
{19769}{19868}I knew I wanted to create this.
{19907}{19963}An American producer|of Polish origin
{19965}{20106}suggested that I come to London|and make a film there.
{20109}{20165}London was fabulous.
{20167}{20206}You cannot imagine what it meant
{20208}{20330}for someone who lived|in the gray, drab communist reality.
{20395}{20496}(Braunsberg)|It was a very civilized way of living:
{20498}{20591}The rooms always full|of friendly faces.
{20593}{20727}You saw your friends every day,|and there were lots of them.
{20729}{20815}Life without limits.
{20979}{21021}I got a phone call|from a friend of ours,
{21023}{21099}a mutual friend|who was a film producer,
{21102}{21181}and he said, "I've got this|friend who's coming to London,
{21183}{21227}"and he doesn't speak|any English.
{21230}{21301}Can you take care of him?"
{21303}{21344}I said, "Sure, send him round."
{21390}{21434}Roman was totally exceptional.
{21437}{21511}I was really drawn to him,|and so was everybody else.
{21514}{21587}Already an established|film director,
{21590}{21642}no one in London|had heard of him.
{21644}{21726}Few people had seen his films.
{21728}{21778}(Polanski)|Yes, yes, yes.
{21781}{21853}Go, go again.
{21855}{21954}[Speaking native language]
{21957}{22011}That was funny.
{22014}{22075}(Braunsberg)|From coming as a complete unknown,
{22078}{22164}I would say, within six months,|everybody knew him.
{22333}{22415}He was a charismatic fellow.
{22417}{22534}There are very few directors|who have Roman's personality
{22536}{22614}and also his appetite for life,
{22616}{22654}his appetite for life.
{22656}{22710}(woman)|Give us a smile.
{22887}{23014}(Braunsberg)|They met in London|because of a film that he made
{23016}{23133}called The Dance of the Vampires.
{23135}{23229}She was a remarkable person...
{23231}{23324}beautiful, gentle,
{23327}{23460}unsophisticated|in the best sense of the word,
{23463}{23551}really a genuine human being.
{23553}{23606}They were great together,|and of course,
{23608}{23714}it created|this fantastic love affair.
{23717}{23800}And it truly was a love affair.
{24822}{24889}(Polanski)|Look, it all started|so long ago.
{24892}{25031}My real problems started then,|with the murder of Sharon Tate.
{25033}{25115}I was all right|with the press before that.
{25189}{25256}They... - they wouldn't let it go.
{25258}{25457}It's just the story|that will never go.
{25524}{25546}Pardon me?
{25548}{25572}Why'd you want|a gag order?
{25574}{25660}We didn't ask for a gag order.
{25663}{25690}Who did, Mr. Dalton?
{25692}{25724}No one asked for a gag order.
{25727}{25792}Then why did the judge|bring it up at this stage?
{25795}{25840}Well, maybe the judge|can answer that.
{25843}{25896}The topic of publicity|was discussed,
{25898}{25962}and certain measures|were discussed
{25964}{26070}to try to control the publicity,
{26072}{26128}but no one asked|for a gag order as such.
{26131}{26180}(man)|There was an hour-long|discussion in chambers.
{26183}{26281}Did that deal principally|with publicity problems?
{26284}{26336}Yes, a great part of it did.
{26338}{26423}(man)|What do you see as the problems|with publicity right now?
{26425}{26496}Well, the problem with publicity is,|there's been too much of it.
{26499}{26559}And, of course,|for me to go on television
{26561}{26638}and complain about publicity|is a little inconsistent.
{26640}{26678}Excuse me.
{26991}{27076}(Dalton)|I've never spoken publicly|about this case before.
{27079}{27206}But if the story is to be told,|I want it to be told factually.
{27208}{27232}I know the facts.
{27235}{27258}I was there.
{27293}{27319}Can you give us|your reaction
{27321}{27360}to the delay of the start|of the trial?
{27362}{27393}My reaction to it?
{27396}{27440}Well, I-I'm pleased.
{27442}{27475}In what way?
{27477}{27512}Well, there's a good deal|of work-up
{27515}{27559}that goes|into any major case.
{27561}{27615}People have the right|to their own opinions
{27617}{27648}about what happened,
{27650}{27700}but they don't have the right|to their own facts.
{27703}{27801}The fact of Polanski|leaving the country and so forth
{27804}{27852}seems to have eclipsed
{27854}{27900}the really important part|of this case
{27902}{27963}about what actually happened|to the system of justice.
{28021}{28121}I remain astounded|after all these years.
{28124}{28188}This case will never leave me.
{28257}{28302}(Brenneman)|Defense attorney Doug Dalton
{28305}{28369}had a very Lincoln-esque quality|about him.
{28372}{28471}Dignified, not given|to flamboyant gestures.
{28473}{28545}He doesn't raise his voice|in the courtroom.
{28547}{28641}He maintains this calm demeanor.
{28644}{28728}And he was the master|of negotiations.
{28730}{28786}The fact that Doug Dalton|was the attorney
{28789}{28864}indicated to me|that there would be
{28866}{28965}a negotiated plea arrived at|between the prosecution,
{28968}{29009}the defense, and the judge.
{29061}{29119}(Preute)|Douglas Dalton was a first-class lawyer,
{29121}{29264}but he was definitely matched|by Roger Gunson.
{29266}{29345}The district attorney's office|put Gunson on the case,
{29348}{29486}a 37-year-old,|very straight-thinking Mormon.
{29488}{29531}We are concerned with the... -
{29534}{29590}protecting the privacy|of the girl,
{29592}{29630}the complaining witness|in this case.
{29632}{29666}And it's my understanding
{29668}{29768}that there have been foreign reporters|and investigators
{29770}{29867}who have attempted to contact her|and have interviews... -
{29870}{29942}(Brenneman)|Gunson was the model of rectitude.
{29944}{30055}He had that same kind|of handsome schoolboy,
{30058}{30166}sparkling good looks|as Robert Redford.
{30169}{30242}The rumor in the district attorney's office
{30244}{30373}was that they picked Gunson|to handle the case
{30375}{30415}because he was a Mormon
{30418}{30468}and because he was the only|member of the DA's office
{30470}{30530}who hadn't had sex|with an underage girl.
{30533}{30621}I heard some jokes|about why they gave it to me,
{30623}{30682}but I can't imagine|those are accurate.
{30684}{30736}There were a lot of prosecutors
{30738}{30811}who had an interest|in high-publicity cases.
{30814}{30887}Although I had had|one very high publicity case,
{30890}{30962}I was not one|that looked for them.
{30964}{31071}They were the perfect attorneys|to handle a case like this,
{31074}{31181}where the evidence|and the players were sensational,
{31183}{31234}were dramatic, flamboyant.
{31236}{31363}So you want two attorneys|who kept an even keel.
{31366}{31442}They were, in that regard,|very strikingly different
{31444}{31488}from the judge in the case.
{31548}{31610}(Gunson)|When the grand jury|came back with the indictment,
{31613}{31723}Judge Rittenband,|who was very interested
{31726}{31753}in handling celebrity cases
{31755}{31851}obviously saw it|and realized that he wanted it,
{31853}{31926}went to the presiding judge|and said,
{31928}{31951}"Hey, I want this case."
{31953}{32024}He was, of course, the senior judge|in Santa Monica,
{32027}{32095}which was the choice location|for any judge,
{32098}{32125}because that's where you get
{32127}{32175}a lot of these|high-publicity cases.
{32177}{32299}Judge Rittenband had handled|a Cary Grant paternity suit.
{32302}{32441}He had handled, well,|the Priscilla and Elvis divorce,
{32443}{32543}the Marlon Brando custody suit|that went on forever.
{32545}{32627}There were quite a few.
{32629}{32741}I spoke to Judge Rittenband|very frequently,
{32743}{32859}and he liked being|among the stars,
{32862}{32916}but I don't think|he was starstruck.
{32919}{32996}(man)|And come to order.|Court is now in session.
{33195}{33263}(Brenneman)|Rittenband loved the press,
{33266}{33377}always had comments|for the press.
{33379}{33465}He wanted to shape the way|the press covered him.
{33503}{33593}Sitting up there on the bench,|he acted like a director,
{33595}{33653}a tyrannical director|calling the shots,
{33655}{33708}telling people|when to make their entrances,
{33711}{33773}what to say,|where to position themselves.
{33775}{33808}Well, it was an... -|it... - I missed... -
{33811}{33842}we misspoke ourselves,|You Honor.
{33844}{33901}There's obviously other basis|for the motion.
{33903}{33947}Yes, we don't need that anymore.
{33949}{33995}(Brenneman)|There were|a lot of similarities
{33997}{34111}between Judge Rittenband|and Roman Polanski.
{34113}{34153}Not too tall in stature.
{34155}{34213}He liked the ladies,|and he loved to dance.
{34215}{34282}He had his friends|in the movie industry,
{34284}{34363}which he'd see every day|at the Hillcrest Country Club.
{34435}{34485}(Roden)|When I first met him,|I was answering phones,
{34487}{34516}and he used to say,
{34519}{34564}"I'm going to Hillcrest.|I'm going to Hillcrest."
{34567}{34659}And finally, I stop and I says,|"What's going on at Hillcrest?"
{34661}{34705}You know, "Do you... -|is your wife there?"
{34707}{34766}You know, 'cause I didn't know|if he was married or not.
{34768}{34803}And he said,|"Oh, I'm not married."
{34806}{34881}And I said, "Oh, okay."
{34954}{35023}I was 20 years old.
{35025}{35053}He was 34 years older.
{35055}{35217}He was 54 when I met him,|and we became friends.
{35219}{35295}(Bessmer)|Oh, golly, practically|every evening, he'd come here,
{35297}{35356}and he'd sit over in that chair.
{35358}{35426}And he loved champagne.
{35428}{35501}So I'd get champagne|by the case.
{35544}{35577}(Wells)|"Judge Rittenband," I said,
{35580}{35624}"What would you at your age|do with a girlfriend?"
{35626}{35664}He said, "I'd do|the same thing that you did
{35666}{35694}and probably better."
{35696}{35728}And I said,|"Well, tell me about it."
{35730}{35762}He said, "Well, I got one|that cooks,
{35764}{35804}and one that does|the other things."
{36013}{36049}Rittenband was known|as a hammer.
{36052}{36118}That means that he was|a tough judge
{36121}{36149}and a tough sentencer.
{36152}{36203}If you didn't make a deal,
{36205}{36293}and you didn't have the deal|in place when you went in there,
{36296}{36355}you were in trouble.
{36424}{36494}I don't remember any judge|that liked publicity like Rittenband did.
{36526}{36589}He'd have his bailiff|maintain a scrapbook
{36592}{36627}that went back many years,
{36629}{36661}and if an article|appeared anywhere
{36664}{36723}about something involving|Laurence J. Rittenband,
{36725}{36785}it wound up in the scrapbook.
{36788}{36829}It was kept somewhere|in the court,
{36831}{36869}I think, in the bailiff's desk,
{36871}{36979}and on occasion would come out|and be displayed.
{37017}{37070}Judge Rittenband|was receiving requests
{37073}{37149}from people all over the world,|from news agencies
{37151}{37198}wanting one of the seats|in his courtroom.
{37234}{37345}He was soliciting reservations|for each one of these chairs.
{37347}{37444}So it was going to be|a real circus.
{38393}{38445}(man)|All right, if you gentlemen|would just stand still,
{38448}{38529}Mr. Polanski will stay here,|and you can get your shot.
{39258}{39329}[Voices overlapping]
{39964}{40018}Because another trial|in the same courtroom
{40020}{40068}is taking much longer|than expected,
{40070}{40114}the rape trial of Roman Polanski
{40116}{40173}has been delayed|until August 9th,
{40175}{40236}exactly eight years to the day|his late wife,
{40238}{40305}actress Sharon Tate,|was brutally murdered.
{40409}{40449}(Brenneman)|At that time,
{40451}{40514}rape victims' names|didn't get reported in the press,
{40516}{40601}much less the names of minors|who were involved in sex cases.
{40603}{40634}But with|the European press there,
{40637}{40731}her name would come out|exposed in the press,
{40734}{40770}her background exposed,
{40772}{40829}the fact that she had|had a prior relationship.
{40831}{40885}She had taken quaaludes before.
{40887}{40918}All of this had gotten out
{40920}{40964}and would have|forever haunted her.
{41045}{41118}Once we knew her name,
{41121}{41210}we knew where her school was,
{41212}{41321}we knew where her house was,
{41323}{41404}the French competition|were after this girl.
{41406}{41454}They were hunting this girl.
{41616}{41670}(Geimer)|It was awful.
{41672}{41737}Everybody knew at school.
{41739}{41798}People came to school|with cameras
{41800}{41908}and things were being said|and printed.
{41910}{42001}The worst part was,|no one believed me.
{42003}{42045}Everybody thought|I was making it up.
{42047}{42154}It was so traumatic, starting that night,|when my mom called the police.
{42156}{42202}Then the police come over,|and they take you to the hospital.
{42204}{42238}Then take you|to the police station.
{42242}{42278}The next morning,|we're getting up at 6:30.
{42282}{42306}We're going to court,
{42308}{42340}where they're gonna|sneak you in,
{42343}{42401}and all these men are gonna|ask you exactly what happened.
{42455}{42522}And they're gonna sit a lady|behind you you can't even see,
{42524}{42557}because then there's|a lady there.
{43934}{43979}All that stuff was so traumatic
{43981}{44114}that I never even had a chance|to really, you know,
{44116}{44203}worry about, you know,|what happened that night with him.
{44205}{44324}It was like, it just... -
{44327}{44392}I had to worry|about surviving the next day.
{44395}{44458}(Dalton)|The facts indicate|that before the... -
{44460}{44508}the alleged act in this case,
{44511}{44576}this girl had engaged|in sexual activity.
{44579}{44651}That's contained in reports|that we now have.
{44653}{44675}We want to know about it.
{44677}{44712}We want to know|who was involved, when.
{44714}{44787}We want to know why these other|people were not prosecuted,
{44789}{44839}and this is a thing|we want to fully develop.
{44841}{44943}(Geimer)|I would have as soon just walked|away from it the next day,
{44945}{45028}but you can't stop it|once it starts.
{45031}{45135}I mean, I just... -
{45180}{45268}I just... - I went in my room,|pretty much,
{45271}{45304}and just turned it off.
{45349}{45450}(man)|In Chinatown, he exposed|the dark side of corruption.
{45452}{45540}In Repulsion,|he explored a warped mind.
{45543}{45632}In Rosemary's Baby,|he examined the occult.
{45635}{45748}Now something altogether new,|altogether chilling.
{45751}{45830}No one does it to you|like Roman Polanski.
{45916}{46000}(Gunson)|I wanted to find more out|about Mr. Polanski,
{46003}{46103}and luck have it,|the Nuart Theater
{46105}{46174}right down the street|on Santa Monica Boulevard
{46177}{46213}had a Polanski film festival
{46216}{46325}right after the indictment|and before trial.
{46327}{46380}(man)|Murder and treason!
{46382}{46417}(woman)|What have you done to its eyes?
{46419}{46490}[Woman crying]
{46529}{46587}Forget it, Jake.|It's Chinatown.
{46639}{46734}(Gunson)|Every Roman Polanski movie|has a theme,
{46737}{46834}corruption meeting innocence|over water.
{46875}{46913}[Laughing]
{46916}{46988}I says, "Oh, well, that's sort of|what we have here,
{46990}{47039}"corruption, Roman Polanski,
{47041}{47091}"meeting innocence,|a 13-year-old girl,
{47093}{47233}over water,|meaning the Jacuzzi."
{47235}{47273}I felt I was gonna be able
{47276}{47398}to pretty well convey to some jurors|that this happened
{47401}{47493}and he had directed a scene|very similar to this
{47496}{47533}in his real life.
{47536}{47603}(woman)|You'd better have|your legs tied down
{47605}{47671}in case of convulsions.
{47779}{47846}(Braunsberg)|Rosemary's Baby|was such a great movie
{47849}{47892}and was so well made
{47894}{47969}that people took it|for the real thing.
{48238}{48264}This is no dream.
{48266}{48330}This is really happening.
{48333}{48464}(Braunsberg)|After that,|Roman had this reputation
{48466}{48507}maybe having been|a little bit in league
{48509}{48543}with the devil himself.
{48618}{48660}It didn't hurt him.
{48662}{48694}People were very intrigued,
{48697}{48823}and it was kind of sexy|in a way.
{48826}{48879}(Farrow)|He had a tremendous power|over people.
{48882}{48935}You had to fall in love with him,|you know?
{48938}{48974}He was completely infectious.
{48977}{49032}There was no resisting him,
{49034}{49071}and every day was so vibrant,
{49074}{49161}because he felt so passionately|about what he was doing,
{49163}{49233}and he was on an adventure.
{49235}{49290}(Harty)|One of the things|that you are renowned for
{49292}{49319}is your recklessness.
{49322}{49362}You say that you're|a reckless person.
{49364}{49386}Do I say that?
{49388}{49412}You say that very frequently
{49414}{49444}to all sorts of people|you talk to,
{49446}{49475}but clearly|you're going to deny
{49478}{49518}every single syllable|of it tonight.
{49520}{49574}Really?
{49577}{49601}I mean, are you|a reckless person?
{49603}{49654}Are you afraid|of anything?
{49656}{49726}I am reckless, but I don't|tell people about it.
{49931}{50004}(man)|Roman found California fantastic.
{50007}{50051}Of Los Angeles, he says...
{50054}{50087}(Polanski)|Everything is easy here.
{50089}{50187}You want to learn karate,|you can learn karate.
{50189}{50255}You want to play chess,|you can play chess.
{50258}{50380}You want to drive racing cars,|you can drive racing cars.
{50383}{50495}You can... - everything is accessible|in this town.
{50497}{50567}[Upbeat music]
{50860}{50930}[applause]
{50961}{51014}(Koch)|Rosemary's Baby was a huge hit.
{51016}{51076}Roman was on top of the world.
{51079}{51131}Nothing could have been better.
{51133}{51163}He was in love with Sharon.
{51165}{51193}They were having great parties.
{51195}{51222}He was going all over the world.
{51224}{51301}(Melnick)|He was the toast of the industry.
{51303}{51339}He was hanging out|with all of the people
{51342}{51391}that everybody wanted|to hang out with.
{51393}{51453}Everybody wanted|a piece of Roman
{51455}{51502}because the work|was so original.
{51577}{51615}Roman, Sharon.
{51617}{51650}Hi.
{51652}{51702}This is the very beautiful|Sharon Tate,
{51704}{51740}who I'm sure you've seen|in films,
{51743}{51808}and her husband,|very talented Roman Polanski,
{51811}{51847}best known|for his original film,
{51849}{51894}Knife in the Water,|which he wrote and directed.
{51896}{51955}And he's also responsible|for Rosemary's Baby,
{51957}{52000}the picture.
{52003}{52037}And I think maybe|a little later,
{52039}{52065}we'll get a chance|to sit down
{52067}{52116}and talk a little bit|about sex and films.
{52119}{52150}Any time.
{52152}{52163}(Farrow)|It certainly was a happy time|for all of us.
{52297}{52343}Roman was happy.
{52345}{52437}He was with beautiful Sharon.
{52439}{52462}Everyone loved her.
{52464}{52514}He loved her.|I loved her.
{52516}{52565}We all loved her.
{52673}{52763}He was so insecure|about so many things.
{52766}{52811}Knowing about his childhood,
{52814}{52905}he didn't have the blueprint|for life that others had.
{52956}{53016}One hoped for Roman, you know,
{53019}{53099}that this brand-new life|with a woman who loved him
{53101}{53205}and who seemed so right for him,|with a baby,
{53207}{53248}that there would be|this security
{53251}{53380}that he had not had in his life|and in a new homeland.
{53382}{53509}I mean, the future was his,|we thought.
{53512}{53569}And then everything|just collapsed.
{53702}{53742}(Braunsberg)|Well, we were preparing a film
{53744}{53818}that I was going to produce|called The Day of the Dolphin.
{53820}{53901}We were writing the script|in London.
{53904}{53937}Roman was a perfectionist.
{53940}{53963}He was always just,
{53965}{53996}"We'll finish it|in a couple of days
{53999}{54051}and then do the rest in L.A."
{54053}{54156}It was a Saturday,|and the phone rang,
{54158}{54207}and I picked it up,
{54209}{54272}and it was our agent|Bill Tennant
{54275}{54320}who was on the phone,
{54322}{54390}and I immediately realized|that something was terribly wrong.
{54392}{54491}I mean, he... - he was a very stable|kind of guy.
{54493}{54599}He was absolutely distraught.
{54601}{54695}And I-I said, "What is it?"
{54697}{54747}And he said, you know,|something like,
{54749}{54806}"They're all dead.|They're all dead."
{54808}{54878}And I realized something awful|had happened,
{54880}{55021}and I gave the phone to Roman, and...
{55147}{55195}I've never seen anything like it.
{55197}{55278}You know, I saw somebody|just disintegrate
{55281}{55328}in front of my eyes.
{55670}{55747}(man)|This was at the home|of movie director Roman Polanski.
{55749}{55823}It was his wife, Sharon Tate,|who was one of the victims.
{55825}{55869}She, too, had repeated|stab wounds.
{55872}{55937}One of the victims had a hood|placed over his head,
{55940}{56043}and the word "pig" was written|in blood on the door.
{56045}{56135}(Braunsberg)|We flew to L.A. The next day.
{56137}{56265}He was devastated,|devastated to a point
{56267}{56322}that I've never seen|any other human being
{56325}{56380}in that kind of condition.
{56542}{56653}And I remember|picking up Sunday newspapers.
{56697}{56880}I was already reasonably aware|of how the press functions,
{56883}{56975}and their business|is selling newspapers.
{57039}{57138}The story was basically how|Roman had flown to Los Angeles,
{57140}{57209}murdered them all,|and then come back.
{57211}{57354}I mean, this was actually|in the newspapers, in the headlines.
{57418}{57493}The nature of the murders,
{57495}{57550}you know, Satanism,|Rosemary's Baby.
{57552}{57594}This is the guy who made|Rosemary's Baby.
{57596}{57638}He knew so much about it.
{57640}{57680}He couldn't have known|so much about it
{57682}{57725}without actually|being involved in it,
{57727}{57797}and so he must have been|part of the cult,
{57799}{57845}and there was a cult,|and they were murdered,
{57847}{57910}and who gets murdered|in this kind of way?
{57913}{57946}And it was a typical example
{57948}{58029}of the victims being responsible|for their own deaths.
{58075}{58125}It was shocking.
{58127}{58172}It was truly unbelievable.
{58229}{58283}The last day I talked to her
{58286}{58360}was a few hours|before the tragedy happened.
{58454}{58633}You are suddenly curious|about my relationship with Sharon
{58635}{58770}within last few months.
{58772}{58842}I can tell you|the last few months,
{58845}{58940}as much as last few years|I spent with her...
{59126}{59235}Were only time|of true happiness in my life.
{59271}{59401}And facts which will be|coming out day after day
{59403}{59462}will make a shame... -
{59464}{59655}a lot of newsmen,|who for selfish reason,
{59658}{59838}write... - unbearable for me... -|horrible things about my wife.
{59875}{59928}(Braunsberg)|After Sharon was murdered,
{59930}{59992}really, everybody|was totally freaked out.
{59994}{60082}It was a very weird time,
{60084}{60146}the highest paranoia.
{60148}{60310}The transition of this sort of|hippy kind of existence in L.A.
{60313}{60554}To this brutal awakening|of an understanding
{60557}{60651}that these kind of absolutely|horrible events can happen.
{60758}{60811}No one locked their doors.
{60813}{60922}No one thought about|that there was any kind of threat.
{60924}{60986}That ended at the end of the '60s
{60988}{61083}and simultaneously|changed everything overnight in L.A.
{61257}{61324}(Gutowski)|It was the end of a fairy tale, really,
{61327}{61439}in Roman's life,|in everybody's life.
{61442}{61550}He would have been|a father of a son
{61553}{61632}who would have now been,|what, 30 years old?
{61634}{61712}Maybe he would have had|other children
{61715}{61803}probably would have continued|living in California.
{61805}{61891}Who knows?
{61916}{61969}How does one survive?
{61972}{62036}When you know his childhood,
{62038}{62115}he's a very, very strong|human being.
{62190}{62274}(Sylbert)|I think that the idea|of the magnet of tragedy
{62276}{62333}started after the Tate murders.
{62336}{62375}He was living out in Malibu,
{62377}{62459}and the neighbors were all,|like, horrified,
{62461}{62550}because somehow, if he was|in the house next door,
{62552}{62593}there was gonna be|another mass murder.
{62596}{62670}I mean, people are just|too weird, I tell you.
{62672}{62711}It's crazy.
{62913}{62948}(Polanski)|Hold it, there, kitty cat.
{62950}{62973}Hold it.
{63131}{63155}Hello, Claude.
{63157}{63194}Where'd you get the midget?
{63328}{63369}You're a very nosy fella,|kitty cat, huh?
{63372}{63421}You know what happens|to nosy fellows?
{63424}{63473}Huh? No?
{63476}{63506}Want to guess?
{63508}{63539}Huh? No?
{63541}{63607}Okay, they lose their noses.
{63719}{63773}Next time you lose|the whole thing.
{63776}{63859}Cut it off|and feed it to my goldfish.
{63861}{63939}(Koch)|Roman was different|when I met him on Chinatown.
{63941}{63972}He's still a guy|that loved life.
{63974}{64032}There was just|this real dark shadow
{64035}{64091}that he had to deal with|every day,
{64093}{64162}that, you know, there were|people who were constantly,
{64164}{64205}"So what was it like,|you know, when you... -
{64207}{64229}"when Sharon... - when your... -
{64232}{64270}you know, when your wife|was killed?"
{64272}{64348}Do you hate certain members|of the press
{64350}{64391}for the way the... -
{64393}{64449}you were treated|after your wife's murder?
{64452}{64529}Well, yes.
{64532}{64560}To be honest, I do.
{64562}{64619}But I wouldn't call it|a hatred now.
{64621}{64721}You see, it's somehow evolved|to just indifference.
{64723}{64773}And I simply don't read it|and try to avoid.
{64776}{64802}Yeah.
{64805}{64889}But, in general,|I despise the press tremendously
{64892}{64993}for its inaccuracy,|for its irresponsibility,
{64995}{65129}and for its often|even deliberate cruelty.
{65132}{65200}And all this,|it's for lucrative purposes.
{65202}{65232}(James)|If one of your complaints
{65234}{65269}is the way the press|misrepresents you,
{65271}{65312}and it is|one of your complaints,
{65314}{65352}then surely it'd be|a good tactic
{65354}{65408}to give them|the minimum possible target.
{65410}{65457}Yes, but then you have to... -
{65460}{65517}you have to change|your lifestyle completely
{65520}{65557}and go into hiding.
{65559}{65613}It seems like, say,|six months after the murders,
{65616}{65637}you're in the Alps
{65640}{65685}and consorting|with these girls
{65687}{65719}from the finishing school|and so on.
{65721}{65753}I mean, it's... -
{65756}{65809}I could see how you would|sort of try to... -
{65812}{65857}to lose yourself|like that,
{65859}{65917}but is... -|is it wise to say so?
{65919}{65981}Yes, it is wise to say so.
{65984}{66006}Why not?
{66009}{66037}Why wouldn't it be wise|to say so?
{66040}{66087}That's the way it was.
{66089}{66122}And that's the way it is,|you know?
{66125}{66176}I mean, just... -
{66178}{66239}different people|have different way
{66241}{66333}of seeing life|and relationships.
{66336}{66422}It's not necessarily the same|with you than me.
{66425}{66528}And people, they react|in different ways to grief.
{66530}{66598}Some go to a monastery.
{66601}{66753}Others start visiting whorehouses.
{66876}{66938}(Sylbert)|He decided he was gonna survive.
{66941}{66997}And the way he was gonna survive
{66999}{67070}is through his talent|and having fun.
{67113}{67151}Whether it was dinner for four
{67153}{67221}and he was holding court|with some idea he had
{67224}{67364}or whether it was a group|of 30 or 40 or 50,
{67366}{67441}he liked to be|the center of it all.
{67443}{67551}He was a wonderful host,|almost like a dance master.
{67553}{67634}He kept it all sort of stirred.
{67637}{67705}It gave him enormous pleasure.
{67708}{67769}And after Sharon,
{67772}{67822}I think he didn't want|to be alone too much.
{67824}{67932}It's not so good to be alone.
{68040}{68151}Everybody knows,|the best way to get close to your dream
{68154}{68250}is to get to know a star,|a real star.
{68252}{68378}Polanski, after Chinatown,|was not only a real star;
{68380}{68546}he was the Roman Polanski,|a big name.
{68548}{68654}She wouldn't mind|being discovered
{68656}{68704}by a man like Roman Polanski.
{68707}{68775}After all, she had seen|in the French Vogue
{68777}{68823}pictures of Nastassia Kinski,
{68826}{68933}who was 15 when she started|her affair with Roman Polanski,
{68935}{68983}or Roman started it with her.
{68986}{69022}And everybody had the opinion,
{69024}{69084}if Polanski wouldn't have done
{69087}{69151}this photo layout|with Nastassia,
{69153}{69251}she would have never become|such a well-known young star.
{69341}{69423}(Geimer)|He was a friend of a guy|my sister was dating,
{69425}{69503}and he wanted girls to model.
{69506}{69560}I was modeling and acting|and wanted to... -
{69563}{69597}you know, wanted to be|in the business.
{69599}{69656}So that was a great opportunity,|you know.
{69659}{69687}We signed right up.
{69690}{69747}"Sure, have my pictures taken|by Roman Polanski.
{69749}{69780}Sounds great."
{69847}{69971}(Preute)|Susie Gailey, the mother|of the alleged victim,
{69974}{70120}introduced herself|as an actress to Polanski.
{70123}{70182}And she had done|some work in films.
{70184}{70251}Well, I was innocent, see?
{70254}{70318}And that's the truth.
{70388}{70419}What else can I say?
{70421}{70503}I remember vaguely|meeting the mother at some party,
{70505}{70587}you know, like, "Hi."
{70589}{70693}And then I was away|and then heard about all of this.
{70695}{70787}But just in what I was told|and what I read,
{70790}{70859}I kept going back|to the same question:
{70862}{70967}Why did the mother bring|her 13-year-old daughter
{70970}{71006}into this group?
{71008}{71059}Especially if she had|spent time with them
{71062}{71139}and all the things that she said|subsequently were true,
{71142}{71183}wouldn't you keep|your 13-year-old daughter
{71185}{71218}away from that?
{71220}{71307}You know, this was a guy|that had a pretty wild reputation.
{71309}{71390}He was known as a womanizer.
{71392}{71441}He's a partygoer.
{71443}{71499}He certainly had a lot of women|over the years,
{71501}{71575}and he loved young women.
{71577}{71679}Why would her mother allow her|to be alone with Polanski?
{71681}{71720}I don't like... - you know,|you always get the,
{71722}{71749}"Where was your mom?"
{71752}{71809}And it's like, you know,|give my mom a break.
{71812}{71852}You know, it's not her fault.
{71855}{71947}And so l... -
{71949}{72011}you know, I don't like hearing|anybody's opinion on it.
{72013}{72043}Every time someone brings it up
{72045}{72123}and they're doing their little,|you know, banter on TV,
{72125}{72152}it's like, "You weren't there.
{72154}{72176}"You don't know.
{72178}{72202}"What are you talking about?
{72204}{72230}"You're saying how I felt,
{72232}{72273}"what happened,|how you feel about Polanski.
{72276}{72307}"You have no idea,
{72309}{72352}"and you're on the news|making all these statements,
{72355}{72393}"and thousands of people|are listening to you,
{72396}{72419}and just shut up."
{72476}{72517}Another hearing|on the admissibility
{72520}{72564}of the Beverly Wilshire|Hotel records
{72566}{72614}has been set for next Friday.
{72616}{72669}From Santa Monica,|Furnell Chatman,
{72672}{72712}News Center 4.
{73004}{73132}(Silver)|I was instrumental|in arranging the plea bargain,
{73134}{73222}because as I looked|at this family and Samantha,
{73224}{73295}I thought, at the time,|some people knew her name,
{73297}{73376}and some of the kids at school|knew who she was.
{73378}{73496}I thought it was important to try|to maintain her anonymity,
{73499}{73536}anonymity which|would have disappeared
{73538}{73590}had the case gone to trial.
{73592}{73676}And so I tried to persuade|the district attorney,
{73678}{73740}who had a new|plea bargaining policy,
{73743}{73777}a tough plea bargaining policy.
{73780}{73841}I said, "I'm not gonna do it.
{73844}{73899}I have no interest in doing it."
{73901}{73974}And so what he decided was... -|he says,
{73976}{74016}"Well, I'm gonna do it myself."
{74304}{74376}[Siren wailing]
{74432}{74508}The LAPD brought|the evidence envelope
{74510}{74556}to this courthouse building
{74558}{74633}and brought it in,|actually, to this room.
{74636}{74789}There were about five, six,|or seven men standing around,
{74792}{74874}looking, peering down|at this evidence envelope,
{74877}{74923}and someone takes it|and turns and opens it,
{74925}{75036}and out falls these|little girl's panties.
{75038}{75142}And so there was|this enormous court battle
{75144}{75215}over property|that belonged to her
{75218}{75247}as to what was to be done|with them.
{75250}{75380}And Judge Rittenband decided|to cut it in half
{75382}{75478}and give half to the prosecution|and half to the defense.
{75480}{75553}The defense expert went over|and put on his latex gloves
{75555}{75582}and came back
{75585}{75753}and then started operating|on these copper panties.
{75755}{75798}If you can imagine the humor
{75801}{75854}of about seven men|sitting around a table.
{75857}{75956}Trying to identify any stains|and to make sure that the cut
{75958}{76017}or the piece includes|part of that stain.
{76019}{76047}And they were fighting and,
{76050}{76090}"No, no, it has to be|just a little to this way.
{76092}{76118}"No, it should be over here.
{76120}{76162}We shouldn't|cut that way at all."
{76164}{76217}So finally they... -|they made the cut.
{76219}{76318}What we understood was that Dalton|was going to take his half
{76320}{76366}and submit it to a lab.
{76369}{76448}I also understood that the lab|was about to give its report
{76450}{76484}in two weeks.
{76486}{76523}And two weeks|and three days later,
{76526}{76570}Dalton called me|on the phone,
{76573}{76672}clearly now, I think, having|the results on the lab report,
{76674}{76767}saying, "You know,|what do you think would happen
{76770}{76896}if we pursued a plea bargain|with the prosecution?"
{76898}{76937}At which point... -|at that point,
{76939}{76994}I realized that now Polanski|had an interest,
{76997}{77085}that the stain in the panties
{77087}{77134}was gonna be|brutal evidence for them.
{77231}{77307}(Dalton)|The prosecution|had loaded Polanski up
{77310}{77374}with multiple charges.
{77377}{77500}The only one he was willing to admit|and to plead guilty to
{77502}{77625}was that he had|had consensual sex with the minor.
{77995}{78066}(Gunson)|Mr. Dalton asked,|"Could it be a misdemeanor?"
{78068}{78100}And I says, "No."
{78102}{78170}"That he not go|to state prison?"
{78173}{78240}And I says,|"No, that's got to be open."
{78242}{78316}And so he agreed to all those,
{78318}{78386}and we agreed that it'd be|unlawful sexual intercourse,
{78389}{78556}the lowest count|that related to the gravamen.
{78558}{78618}The agreement was
{78621}{78718}that Polanski would plead guilty|to the one count,
{78720}{78881}that he would be sentenced|based upon a probation report
{78883}{78940}and the argument of counsel.
{78943}{79026}At that time, the sentence|for unlawful sexual intercourse
{79028}{79111}was what they characterized|as an indeterminate sentence.
{79114}{79156}So you're sent to state prison
{79159}{79244}from anywhere from six months|to 50 years.
{79247}{79331}I checked, and there hadn't been|anyone sent to prison
{79333}{79371}for a conviction of this offense
{79373}{79475}in the year preceding|Roman Polanski's case.
{79477}{79533}I thought it was|a very good disposition
{79535}{79625}for the reason|that it vindicated the family
{79627}{79659}and the girl,
{79662}{79814}and it exposed Mr. Polanski|to significant time in custody
{79816}{79846}based upon a probation report.
{79848}{79927}(man)|By entering his guilty plea,
{79929}{79972}Polanski avoided going to trial,
{79975}{80028}a trial that was|to have begun tomorrow,
{80031}{80074}the eighth anniversary|of his wife's death
{80076}{80174}at the hands|of the Charles Manson family.
{80176}{80245}Standing with his lawyer|Douglas Dalton,
{80247}{80319}Polanski was asked|by Deputy District Attorney Roger Gunson
{80321}{80375}to what count he pleaded guilty.
{80377}{80462}Polanski: "I had intercourse|with a female person,
{80464}{80527}not my wife,|who was under 18 years of age."
{80530}{80619}Gunson: "How old|did you think the girl was?"
{80622}{80698}Polanski:|"I understood she was 13."
{80700}{80767}The plea bargaining|was the result of a request
{80769}{80852}by attorney Lawrence Silver,|representing the girl's family.
{80854}{80922}Silver asked Judge Laurence|Rittenband to accept the plea
{80924}{80979}and protect the girl|from the glare of publicity.
{80981}{81074}Silver: "A stigma would attach|to her for a lifetime,
{81076}{81136}and justice is not made|of such stuff."
{81192}{81242}Judge Rittenband,|in accepting the guilty plea,
{81244}{81309}ordered Polanski to be examined|by two psychiatrists.
{81312}{81344}Sentencing will come after that,
{81346}{81384}when the judge could declare|the director
{81386}{81425}a mentally disordered|sex offender.
{81428}{81527}That could result in commitment|to a state mental hospital.
{81529}{81617}Other possible sentences|include one year in county jail,
{81620}{81669}up to 50 years|in a state prison,
{81672}{81729}deportation, or probation.
{81828}{81898}(Dalton)|We took our chances,|obviously, here,
{81900}{82011}because we had no idea|or no way of knowing
{82013}{82092}what the probation department|would conclude.
{82490}{82564}(Markman)|Judge Rittenband appointed me|to evaluate Mr. Polanski
{82566}{82674}for purposes of determining|whether he was at that time
{82677}{82733}a mentally disordered|sex offender,
{82735}{82834}which was a legal term|having to do with an individual who,
{82837}{82909}by reason of a mental disorder,
{82911}{82986}was predisposed to the commission|of sexual offenses
{82989}{83098}that rendered him a danger|to the health and safety of others.
{83101}{83203}He was a very congenial|but somewhat reserved guy
{83205}{83283}who was very straightforward|in the interview.
{83328}{83383}As experiences go,
{83385}{83441}Roman Polanski has had more
{83444}{83521}than what would impact|on a dozen people
{83523}{83628}in terms of his life as a child,|confusion.
{83630}{83720}And ultimately, he gets|what he feels is a stable relationship,
{83722}{83796}and that's taken away from him|at the snap of a finger.
{83838}{83870}He had difficulty
{83873}{83949}in developing relationships|with women after that.
{83952}{84049}I think he felt|very, very hesitant,
{84051}{84100}maybe out of fear.
{84102}{84204}My opinion paralleled|the recommendation
{84206}{84252}of the probation department.
{84254}{84297}I didn't talk about whether|he should go... -
{84299}{84327}should or should not go to jail.
{84329}{84400}I really focused solely|on the psychiatric issues,
{84402}{84462}and it was my opinion|that Mr. Polanski did not qualify
{84465}{84542}as a mentally disordered|sex offender
{84545}{84588}and should not be handled|as such.
{84694}{84769}(Wells)|My feeling was,|the guy belonged in state prison.
{84771}{84805}Rittenband had asked me|about it.
{84807}{84844}I said, "Judge," I said,
{84846}{84892}"You know, you're gonna|give this guy probation."
{84894}{84929}He said, "No, I want|to send him to jail."
{84932}{84958}I said, "You'll never do it,
{84961}{85001}"because the first thing|that's gonna happen
{85004}{85066}when you sentence him:|He's gonna appeal it."
{85069}{85121}"I'm gonna give him a year|in a county jail."
{85124}{85177}That would be the sentence|that appealed immediately.
{85180}{85224}"I'm gonna give him weekends|in the county jail."
{85226}{85248}Immediate appeal.
{85250}{85290}No matter what the sentence was,
{85293}{85388}if it included a day in jail,|Dalton, and correctly so,
{85390}{85428}would have appealed it.
{85430}{85481}And it's gonna go all the way|up to the state supreme court.
{85483}{85512}He has the money.
{85514}{85553}And he'll take it|to the U. S. Supreme Court
{85555}{85588}if he thinks he can.
{85625}{85722}He says,|"Well, what am I gonna do?"
{85725}{85773}(Brenneman)|The judge called me in to chambers.
{85775}{85882}He looked at me and said,|"Dick, tell me.
{85885}{85945}What the hell do I do|with Polanski?"
{85949}{86061}And I went, "Whoa, Your Honor,|that's your decision.
{86063}{86090}"That's not mine.
{86092}{86118}"I'm a reporter.
{86120}{86158}I can't advise you|on something like that."
{86161}{86234}I hadn't been covering courts|that long,
{86236}{86302}but I knew a decision by a judge
{86305}{86354}was supposed to be|a decision by a judge
{86357}{86459}and was not to take in any advice|from any other person
{86462}{86530}other than what was there|in the law books,
{86532}{86633}what had been entered|into evidence in the case.
{86635}{86682}(Wells)|He says,|"Well, what am I gonna do
{86685}{86710}or what should I do?"
{86713}{86748}And I said,|"You know, what you should do
{86750}{86829}is send him up|for a 90-day observation."
{86831}{86904}A 12.03.03 is a diagnostic study
{86906}{86967}where a defendant|on a felony case
{86970}{87044}is sent to Chino|for a 90-day observation.
{87046}{87155}It's like a in-depth|probation report.
{87158}{87192}And he says,|"Well, what will that do?"
{87194}{87229}And I said,|"It's not a final sentence.
{87231}{87253}"He can't appeal it.
{87255}{87278}He has to go."
{87703}{87785}(Dalton)|We were very pleased when we got|the probation report.
{87787}{87891}It recommended that Polanski|serve no time in custody
{87894}{87978}and receive a straight|probationary sentence.
{87980}{88081}However, we received a call|from Judge Rittenband
{88083}{88118}asking us to come to chambers,
{88120}{88188}that he wanted|to discuss the matter with us.
{88191}{88279}The probation officer,|Roger Gunson, and I
{88282}{88390}all went into his chambers|for a meeting.
{88392}{88476}At that time, the judge said|he was not going to follow
{88479}{88551}the recommendation|of the probation department.
{88553}{88633}He had decided|that as punishment for Polanski,
{88635}{88705}he was going to send him|to the state prison at Chino
{88707}{88794}for a diagnostic study.
{88796}{88880}Gunson and the probation officer|both protested.
{88883}{88987}I told him that the law|was that the diagnostic study
{88990}{89105}was not to be used as punishment|or as someone's sentence.
{89107}{89143}The courts are not|supposed to use that.
{89145}{89206}And his response was,
{89208}{89312}"I don't want to send|Mr. Polanski to county jail,
{89315}{89370}"because I don't|want to be responsible
{89372}{89469}if he were to be injured|or killed."
{89471}{89554}(Dalton)|I said, "Judge, we had not|expected this.
{89556}{89668}"Polanski's engaged right now|in directing a large movie
{89670}{89741}"that involves many people,|millions of dollars.
{89744}{89822}This is gonna cause|a tremendous hardship."
{89824}{89940}And he suggested|that I request a stay,
{89943}{90081}a stay meaning to defer,|put off this diagnostic study,
{90084}{90120}in order for Polanski
{90123}{90225}to be able to complete his work|on the film.
{90879}{91017}What he wanted to do was have us|go out into open court
{91020}{91066}and pretend as though... -
{91068}{91120}I don't know if he'd|use the word pretend... -
{91122}{91220}but not to divulge that we knew|what was going to happen.
{91223}{91327}He said,|"I want you to go out, Gunson,
{91329}{91448}"and you argue that Polanski|should be placed in custody,
{91451}{91488}"and, Dalton, you go out,
{91490}{91594}"and you argue that he should be|put on probation.
{91596}{91656}"Then I will make my remarks,
{91658}{91776}"and I will sentence him to Chino|for the diagnostic study,
{91778}{91883}"and the press need not know|anything more about this.
{91885}{91945}"If you do not|tell the press about this,
{91948}{92003}"and if Polanski receives|a good report
{92005}{92050}"from the probation department,
{92052}{92144}"which we all|are quite sure he will,
{92146}{92203}that will conclude|his punishment."
{92275}{92315}I wasn't going|to argue about it.
{92317}{92368}Polanski's fate|hung in the balance.
{92370}{92461}If I started protesting|about the diagnostic study,
{92464}{92496}Rittenband could well have said,
{92498}{92560}"Well, I'll just send him to prison.
{92562}{92588}How would you like that?"
{92590}{92776}That was the fabrication|that he... -
{92778}{92844}the scenario|that he wanted to present
{92847}{92874}and he did present.
{93171}{93222}(Dalton)|This thing had reached the point
{93224}{93288}where it was actually|becoming surreal.
{93497}{93581}Gunson and I walked|into the courtroom,
{93584}{93742}which was packed|with newsmen and spectators.
{93744}{93832}We took our places|at the counsel table, sat down,
{93834}{93909}and waited for the entrance|of Judge Rittenband.
{93911}{93985}I argued first.
{93987}{94052}It was a very strange feeling|to be arguing
{94054}{94126}when I knew exactly|what the result was going to be.
{94128}{94192}It was like having a mock trial.
{94194}{94229}In law school, we did this.
{94231}{94291}We had staged trials|and so forth,
{94294}{94358}but even then, we didn't know|what the result was going to be.
{94361}{94416}But we dutifully went out.
{94418}{94474}I argued for probation.
{94477}{94541}I tried to make it sound|as authentic as I could.
{94543}{94650}Gunson got up|and made his argument,
{94653}{94760}and then Rittenband proceeded|to give his closing remarks,
{94762}{94868}which had been|obviously prepared in advance.
{94870}{94929}He argued much better|than either one of us,
{94931}{94985}and as I sat there and listened,|I thought,
{94987}{95065}"I think I see|what's happening here.
{95067}{95122}"He knows that this is|a probation case.
{95125}{95220}"The probation department|has recommended probation.
{95222}{95305}"Chino will very likely|recommend the same thing.
{95307}{95382}"And he wants to condition|the press and the public
{95384}{95462}"to the fact that when he|puts Polanski on probation,
{95465}{95513}"that they see the basis|that he used
{95515}{95559}in arriving at that conclusion."
{95604}{95639}(woman)|After 20 minutes in court
{95642}{95694}before Superior Judge|Laurence Rittenband,
{95697}{95778}film director Roman Polanski|and his lawyer Douglas Dalton
{95781}{95808}emerged from the courtroom
{95810}{95877}amidst a crush of reporters|and cameramen.
{95934}{96003}Dalton had asked the court|to place Polanski on probation,
{96006}{96080}arguing that, though the crime|of unlawful intercourse
{96082}{96185}is a serious one,|it is not a unique crime.
{96187}{96271}The prosecutor, Deputy District Attorney|Roger Gunson,
{96274}{96326}asked that Polanski|be placed in custody,
{96328}{96396}though it was noted that|the 13-year-old girl in the case
{96398}{96435}and her family|had asked the court
{96438}{96497}not to incarcerate|the film director.
{96499}{96598}On the basis of two|psychiatric evaluations,
{96600}{96630}the judge ruled that Polanski
{96632}{96687}was not a mentally disordered|sex offender,
{96690}{96749}but he did order Polanski|to undergo 90 days
{96751}{96829}further psychiatric testing|at Chino state prison,
{96831}{96922}postponing a final sentence|until the testing is completed.
{96924}{97000}Judge Rittenband granted Polanski|a three-month stay
{97003}{97043}to conclude his present work.
{97046}{97074}At the end of that time,
{97076}{97131}the film director will go|to Chino state prison
{97133}{97187}for 90 days diagnostic testing.
{97189}{97259}Robin Groth, NBC news,|Santa Monica.
{97288}{97363}Sentencing put off|Until he finishes film
{97365}{97407}Why are you leaving|the country, sir?
{97409}{97431}Sorry?
{97433}{97462}Why are you leaving|the country?
{97464}{97495}Where?
{97497}{97532}You're gonna leave the country|on a business trip,
{97535}{97556}is that correct?
{97559}{97586}Can you tell us|about that trip?
{97588}{97623}I'm going to Paris.
{97625}{97661}Will you come back?
{97663}{97707}Will I come back?
{97709}{97731}I certainly will.
{97733}{97758}What do you think about... -
{97760}{97787}Don't worry.
{98092}{98155}Dino just called up and said,|"Wonderful news.
{98158}{98211}"My god, Lorenzo, we got Roman.
{98213}{98247}We got Roman."
{98274}{98328}It was a potboiler:
{98331}{98424}Pearl divers getting caught|in a giant clam and all that stuff.
{98427}{98475}And Roman had reasonable|contempt for the script;
{98477}{98523}not a picture that Roman|would have done.
{98525}{98575}And I imagine that... -|again, I didn't discuss it,
{98578}{98612}but basically, nobody else,|I presume,
{98615}{98638}would hire him at that time.
{98640}{98696}And De Laurentiis,
{98699}{98787}seeing a chance|to get a great director
{98790}{98836}who otherwise he couldn't|possibly have approached
{98839}{98923}for this project,|stepped in immediately.
{98926}{98975}It was a coup, a triumph,
{98977}{99051}you know, taking advantage|of this guy's troubles to some extent.
{99053}{99095}Better luck for Roman|would have been a judge
{99098}{99145}that never allowed him|to go to Europe at all.
{99249}{99283}(Mollinger)|Roman called me; he said,
{99286}{99350}"Listen, I mean, I'm here in Munich.|Can we meet?"
{99352}{99375}I said, "Of course."
{99377}{99442}And we decided|to go in the evening
{99444}{99495}to see the Oktoberfest.
{99497}{99531}Roman actually|didn't want to go,
{99534}{99575}but we said,|"You have to see that,
{99577}{99610}"because this is unbelievable.
{99612}{99704}"You have never seen 10,000|people in a tent, drunken.
{99707}{99751}I mean, you must see that."
{99753}{99775}And he said, "Okay."
{99777}{99802}He said, "I go with you."
{99862}{99934}So finally,|we went to a special box.
{99936}{99962}I was with my girlfriend
{99964}{100011}and two other girlfriends,|you know.
{100695}{100778}(Braunsberg)|Most unfortunately,|he was photographed
{100781}{100868}caught in a pose where sitting|in between two girls.
{100870}{100909}It was quite innocent.
{100912}{100987}But, you know, photographs... -|they say a photograph doesn't lie.
{100989}{101046}Nothing lies more|than a photograph.
{101089}{101165}(Semple, Jr.)|Roman always did have bad luck.
{101167}{101216}And this is|the kind of thing that a... -
{101218}{101291}a cautious person|would not have dreamed of doing.
{101293}{101341}I mean, they would have|had themselves photographed
{101343}{101424}in the cathedral|or doing something like that.
{101426}{101532}That one photograph|changed everything.
{101534}{101568}I took it in to Rittenband
{101570}{101617}because I figured it was|something he ought to see.
{101619}{101649}And what I told him was, I said,
{101651}{101694}"You know, Judge,|you've made so many mistakes,
{101697}{101721}"I think, in this case.
{101723}{101765}"Look, he's giving you the finger.|He's flipping you off."
{101767}{101855}And I said, "Haven't you|had enough of this?"
{101857}{101902}He says, "What? What?
{101905}{101986}He's not getting away|with that."
{101989}{102088}The judge became furious|when this appeared in the paper.
{102090}{102175}He was interviewed|by a Hollywood gossip columnist,
{102177}{102227}Marilyn Beck.
{102229}{102277}Rittenband told me|that he had been duped.
{102280}{102324}I really believe|he had been duped.
{102326}{102431}(Dalton)|In the interview,|he said that very possibly
{102433}{102492}he wanted Polanski|back in the country,
{102494}{102578}and Polanski could be|on his way to prison now.
{102581}{102657}(Gunson)|That photograph|embarrassed the judge.
{102659}{102729}Mr. Polanski is supposed to be|very focused and intent
{102732}{102757}when he's working,
{102759}{102795}and this photograph demonstrated
{102797}{102847}that at that moment in time,|he was not.
{102849}{102897}(man)|Why was he in Germany
{102899}{102947}when he should have been|working hard on a movie?
{102949}{103014}Could you clear up|that apparent misunderstanding?
{103149}{103239}(Sidewater)|The judge ordered Roman|to come back to the States,
{103241}{103354}and he called Dino in|to testify.
{103357}{103478}Dino explained through me|as the translator
{103481}{103545}that we were going on|with the production,
{103548}{103603}the preparation|of the production,
{103605}{103717}and that this was just part|of the whole thing of making movies.
{103719}{103766}(man)|Mr. De Laurentiis,|could you explain to us
{103769}{103821}why you sent Mr. Polanski|to Germany?
{103824}{103889}(Sidewater)|Roman was still working|when he was in Munich,
{103891}{103995}because the distributor|convinced Roman to come there
{103997}{104086}and spend a night|or go out for a few drinks
{104090}{104171}and, at the same time,|talk about Hurricane.
{104174}{104246}I don't believe he should.
{104248}{104337}(Sidewater)|I don't think the judge|knew that or understood that,
{104339}{104414}and most of all,|he didn't believe it.
{104416}{104442}Okay, now step aside,|please.
{104445}{104519}Let him through.
{104522}{104564}(Dalton)|De Laurentiis testified.
{104566}{104610}Roman testified.
{104613}{104691}There was no evidence at all|to the contrary.
{104694}{104789}I rested my case, and the ruling|had to be, of course,
{104791}{104863}that he was there|on business purposes,
{104866}{104941}and that was|the finding of the judge.
{105275}{105332}I told him, "You know,|you just have to bear up
{105334}{105365}"and go through this.
{105367}{105426}"And remember,|at the conclusion of this,
{105429}{105470}"this case will be over.
{105472}{105526}"You'll have no further time|in custody,
{105529}{105579}and it will all be behind you."
{105701}{105733}(man)|That's Dalton?
{105735}{105777}(man #2)|Yeah, that was Dalton,|his lawyer.
{106004}{106054}(man)|Mr. Dalton, has Mr. Polanski|talked to you
{106057}{106091}about his reaction|to coming here
{106094}{106135}for this almost|three-month period?
{106138}{106167}Yes, he has.
{106170}{106220}Excuse me, I have some business|to conduct in here.
{106222}{106275}Has he indicated to you|as to what his feelings are?
{106278}{106312}Hi.|Hi.
{106798}{106878}(man)|Mr. Polanski, do you have|any kind of statement at all?
{106880}{106930}Mr. Polanski, do you have|any statement at all?
{106975}{107046}[Voices overlapping]
{107143}{107192}Mr. Polanski, do you have|any statement at all
{107195}{107232}regarding this|90-day psychiatric stint
{107235}{107267}that you've come here for?
{107269}{107295}No.
{107297}{107332}No statement whatsoever?
{107335}{107375}What are your immediate|thoughts right now?
{107377}{107423}[Indistinct]
{107425}{107470}Any thoughts|that you have at all?
{107731}{107774}(man)|Where's the lawyer?
{107991}{108058}(man)|Will he be given any|special consideration here?
{108060}{108129}Nothing other than anybody else|that would come in.
{108132}{108168}When we talk about|special housing
{108171}{108200}or special consideration,
{108203}{108263}what we're talking about is,|everybody that comes in,
{108265}{108348}we screen them for possible|protective custody housing,
{108350}{108408}but we're concerned|for his safety.
{108673}{108712}(Koch)|There were sketches.|There were locations.
{108714}{108750}You know,|people had been up to Chino
{108752}{108778}and talked to Roman.
{108780}{108836}I mean, he was prepping|the movie from Chino.
{108838}{108904}(Sidewater)|Dino and I went to visit Roman.
{108906}{108941}Dino, of course, was concerned
{108944}{108989}as to what was going to happen|with his film.
{108992}{109074}I was kind of shocked|when we saw Roman.
{109076}{109182}We were sitting outside at a table|outside of the prison.
{109184}{109228}He was nervous,
{109230}{109301}always looking over his shoulder|to see who was in back of him.
{109364}{109392}He said that he was concerned
{109394}{109472}about what the other prisoners|would do to him
{109475}{109510}if they could get near him,
{109512}{109603}because he was accused|of being a child molester.
{109714}{109748}(Braunsberg)|It was very grim.
{109750}{109837}And it was|a very frightening place.
{109840}{109946}You know, this is a hard-core... -|you know, murderers,
{109948}{109998}and Roman was not safe there.
{110044}{110095}People get killed there.
{110437}{110480}(Dalton)|Polanski, of course,|was delighted.
{110483}{110544}He... - he felt,|and as properly he should,
{110547}{110623}that he had lived up|to his obligations in the case.
{110625}{110656}He admitted his guilt.
{110659}{110720}He served the sentence|that had been imposed,
{110723}{110744}and now it was over,
{110747}{110787}and he could go on|with his life.
{110848}{110939}(Gunson)|I was quite surprised.
{110941}{111024}Everyone in the criminal justice|system is aware
{111026}{111120}that 90-day diagnostic studies|take less than 90 days.
{111122}{111170}There's not very many people,|I would guess,
{111172}{111235}who have had the experience|of it only being 42.
{111237}{111279}That's not a punishment.
{111281}{111308}A punishment... -
{111311}{111383}you know, he was charged|with very serious crimes.
{111386}{111459}You're talking|about crimes that... -
{111461}{111505}that would incur|state prison time,
{111507}{111586}maybe 10, 15, 20 years|in state prison.
{111589}{111661}13-year-old girl,
{111664}{111705}where he had|sexual intercourse with her,
{111708}{111822}sodomized her, gave her drugs,|gave her alcohol.
{111825}{111872}(Vannatter)|He got off with nothing.
{111953}{111993}(man)|Mr. Gunson, it's usually|the practice
{111996}{112030}of the district attorney's|office to... -
{112033}{112093}to prosecute the defendant|to the fullest degree.
{112096}{112144}You deviated apparently|in this case. Why?
{112146}{112197}(woman)|Why did you agree|to copping out on the plea
{112200}{112263}if he should have had|a full trialwith the charges?
{112265}{112293}What do you mean|"copping out"?
{112296}{112381}(Gunson)|Between the time|that the judge agreed
{112384}{112477}that the 90-day diagnostic study|be his sentence,
{112479}{112550}there had been|lots of new media reports
{112553}{112604}very critical of the judge.
{112606}{112667}And now that it appears
{112669}{112753}that Mr. Polanski|will be walking away from a rape
{112756}{112818}after just serving 42 days
{112821}{112865}is going to be embarrassing|to the judge,
{112868}{112933}and he needs to overcome it.
{113322}{113385}(Koch)|My father was at Hillcrest|Country Club,
{113387}{113446}washing his hands|in the locker room.
{113448}{113530}And standing next to him|was Judge Rittenband.
{113533}{113625}And one of the gentlemen at Hillcrest|came up to Rittenband
{113627}{113654}and said,|"Are you really gonna
{113657}{113730}let that little Polish|blah-blah-blah off?"
{113733}{113826}And Rittenband said,|"Well, he thinks so, but no way.
{113829}{113895}"We're gonna put that|little blank-blank away
{113898}{113921}for the rest of his life."
{114184}{114275}(Dalton)|When we met in his chambers,|at this time,
{114278}{114311}Judge Rittenband said
{114314}{114404}that he wasn't going to honor|the promise that he had made
{114406}{114459}about releasing Polanski
{114462}{114532}upon completion|of the diagnostic study.
{114534}{114634}He gave as his reason|that he was getting too much criticism.
{114637}{114754}The judge says that 42 days|is not enough time in custody,
{114756}{114831}that he expected him|to be in there 90 days,
{114834}{114978}and so somehow he has to make up|these 48 days
{114980}{115044}of the intended sentence of 90.
{115047}{115115}Now, Gunson at this point said,
{115117}{115181}"If it's 48 more days you want,
{115183}{115286}why don't you just give him|48 days in the county jail?
{115288}{115355}"And then|you will have accomplished
{115357}{115435}him serving the full 90 days in jail."
{115438}{115535}And Rittenband said, no,|he was not willing to do that,
{115538}{115620}because the perception|of a prison sentence
{115623}{115683}must be maintained|for the press.
{115999}{116114}He told me that|if I would come back to court
{116116}{116224}after the press was gone|and the public was gone,
{116227}{116312}that he would then|recall Polanski
{116315}{116373}and he would be released|from prison.
{116474}{116545}[Steady drum beat]
{116839}{116940}(Gunson)|It became obvious to me|that he wanted him deported,
{116943}{117040}because he did not|want him around here,
{117043}{117119}embarrassing the judge any more|than he already had.
{117121}{117192}[Steady drum beat]
{117348}{117419}He wanted Roman to agree
{117422}{117544}that he would voluntarily|waive any rights he may have
{117547}{117587}regarding deportation.
{117590}{117703}Rittenband had no jurisdiction|over such matters,
{117705}{117787}and it is illegal|to impose an illegal condition
{117789}{117844}upon somebody serving time|in custody,
{117847}{117892}and so we now|are in the category
{117895}{117979}of actual illegal conduct.
{117982}{118035}This was getting|rather contentious,
{118038}{118086}as you might understand,
{118088}{118143}and I said,|"If we're gonna do that, judge,
{118145}{118211}"I want to have a hearing|regarding the sentencing
{118213}{118257}"as we're entitled to do,
{118259}{118299}"and I want to have|witnesses here,
{118301}{118347}and I want to have a hearing."
{118350}{118418}And he said, "Well,|I'm gonna sentence him anyway,
{118420}{118498}"and if you still insist|on having your hearing,
{118499}{118540}"then I may|withdraw these things
{118544}{118587}"that I told you that I would do
{118590}{118642}"if you went along|with this thing
{118644}{118732}that I'm going to do tomorrow."
{118735}{118811}The proceeding was concluded|by Judge Rittenband,
{118813}{118848}as he had done before,
{118850}{118949}directed me|to argue for probation.
{118952}{119048}He wanted Gunson to again argue|for time in custody,
{119050}{119092}and then he would|impose the sentence
{119095}{119127}that he had discussed with us.
{119129}{119226}I certainly was not arguing|for state prison in chambers.
{119228}{119282}Nor did I intend to argue
{119284}{119337}that he should send him|to state prison
{119340}{119456}to participate in this sham|that the judge was involved in.
{119458}{119492}We got up.
{119495}{119576}We walked out of the room.
{119578}{119705}I remember saying immediately|to Gunson,
{119707}{119769}"I'm not going to do this again.
{119772}{119814}"No matter what he does,
{119817}{119888}I'm not gonna participate|in this thing."
{119890}{119949}And Gunson said,|"I'm not going to do it either."
{119951}{120056}As we walked down the aisle,
{120058}{120156}past the chairs of an empty courtroom|at that time,
{120158}{120216}Doug Dalton turned to me|and said,
{120218}{120323}"Do you think|that I can trust the judge?"
{120325}{120437}And I said something|that I wish I hadn't said,
{120439}{120488}and maybe it did|or didn't make a difference,
{120490}{120529}but I shouldn't have said it.
{120532}{120637}And what I said to him was,|"I don't know why not.
{120640}{120718}You trusted him once."
{120721}{120790}[Plodding beat music]
{121215}{121306}I didn't know what|I was going to do the following day.
{121309}{121395}I did know that I was|no longer gonna participate
{121397}{121460}in a proceeding|that was being designed
{121462}{121553}solely to advance the purposes|of Judge Rittenband.
{121555}{121758}I told Mr. Dalton|that I would be available to...
{121761}{121884}disclose this information|to anyone at any place at any time.
{121886}{121993}(Dalton)|I contacted Roman, and I said|for them to come to my office.
{121996}{122093}We discussed what was gonna happen|the following morning.
{122096}{122149}I told him|that it was my opinion
{122150}{122217}that the sentence|would be illegal,
{122221}{122304}that we could probably obtain|relief on appeal,
{122306}{122353}but that would involve|a long procedure,
{122355}{122428}and Polanski|would be incarcerated
{122430}{122483}during that period of time.
{122486}{122556}I said that the judge had said
{122558}{122716}that if Roman agreed|to waive any deportation hearing
{122718}{122762}and be deported,
{122764}{122826}that he would then be released
{122829}{122976}if he also had by then|served 48 days.
{122978}{123054}Roman said to me,|"Can we trust him?"
{123056}{123138}And I said,|"No, we can't trust him.
{123140}{123211}"We have no idea what he may do.
{123214}{123287}"We've all agreed that|he can no longer be trusted,
{123290}{123365}and what he represents to us|is worthless."
{123450}{123506}With that, Roman got up,|looked at me,
{123509}{123590}and I believe he said,|"I'll see you guys later,"
{123593}{123638}and he left the room.
{123990}{124053}(Sidewater)|There were two or three|other people there,
{124055}{124110}and I gave Roman an envelope
{124113}{124228}which I thought was script notes|or something else.
{124349}{124480}The general feeling I had is,|"Why is everybody so nervous?"
{124482}{124543}There was an electricity|in the air.
{126093}{126121}(Dalton)|What does it have to do
{126124}{126188}with what was my conversation|with Mr. Polanski?
{126191}{126218}My conversation with him
{126220}{126289}is protected by|the attorney-client privilege.
{126292}{126358}I can't divulge to you|the substance
{126360}{126427}or the content|of my conversation with him,
{126429}{126472}only to say what I said|in court,
{126475}{126532}that he did call me this morning|at my home,
{126535}{126588}and he told me|he would not be here.
{126590}{126692}I asked him to call me again,
{126694}{126752}because I wanted to discuss this|with him further
{126754}{126813}and attempt to persuade him|to return.
{126816}{126860}He said he would call me again.
{126862}{126892}Doug, the court asked you
{126894}{126927}whether you thought|you might be able
{126929}{126960}to talk him|into coming back.
{126963}{126997}What was yourresponse?
{127000}{127052}I said that I thought|I had a reasonable chance
{127054}{127078}of being successful.
{127080}{127107}(woman)|How will you try to... -
{127109}{127168}how will you try to do it?
{127170}{127228}(man)|Can you tell us what makes you|think he's out of the country?
{127231}{127260}No, I can't tell you that.
{127262}{127352}What happens if he does not|come back, Mr. Dalton?
{127355}{127390}Then the court|goes ahead... -
{127392}{127416}I'm not going to speculate.
{127418}{127452}(man)|Roman Polanski is in seclusion.
{127455}{127495}His friends say inside|this fashionable building
{127497}{127540}in downtown Paris,|where he keeps an apartment.
{127543}{127593}(man)|He skipped the country|early yesterday,
{127596}{127642}only hours before|he was to be sentenced
{127644}{127677}for illegally having sex... -
{127680}{127726}(man #2)|He had given her champagne|and a quaalude.
{127728}{127785}(man #3)|He has told a friend here|his refrigerator is full,
{127788}{127820}and he does not intend to leave.
{127823}{127897}(woman)|Many feel the aura of tragedy|and sensationalism
{127900}{127987}that surrounds Polanski obscures|his brilliance as a director.
{127989}{128035}(woman #2)|Judge in the Roman Polanski|morals case
{128037}{128075}said today he intended|to send Polanski... -
{128077}{128115}(man)|He says a year|of torture is enough.
{128117}{128163}(man #2)|Has begun proceedings|to force Polanski
{128165}{128206}back to the United States.
{128208}{128276}However, authorities are|not optimistic about succeeding.
{128278}{128324}(Trott)|I'm advised|that the treaty with France
{128326}{128408}might not allow for his return|to this country at our request
{128411}{128451}to be sentenced on this charge.
{128453}{128483}(man)|Why is that?
{128485}{128512}As far as I can tell,
{128514}{128592}the treaty only specifies,|number one, rape.
{128594}{128644}As you know, Mr. Polanski|was not convicted of rape.
{128646}{128703}He was convicted|of unlawful sexual intercourse,
{128705}{128740}and that's a different|crime than rape.
{128743}{128844}Secondly, the treaty specifies|that it's discretionary
{128847}{128905}on the part of France|to return French citizens.
{128908}{128940}In other words,|they have an option.
{128942}{128969}They can or they can't,
{128972}{129017}depending on how they feel|about a particular case
{129020}{129061}or maybe even possibly|a particular person.
{129064}{129150}Whether the DA succeeds|in extraditing Polanski or not,
{129152}{129223}Judge Laurence Rittenband plans|to impose Polanski's sentence
{129225}{129257}on February 14th,
{129260}{129318}with or without|the filmmaker's presence.
{129320}{129418}The length of time, of course,|would depend upon whether or not
{129421}{129480}there would be a deportation
{129482}{129559}or if not deported|involuntarily,
{129561}{129653}he would agree|with the director of immigration
{129656}{129786}to consent in writing|to leaving the country,
{129789}{129890}in which case, any balance|of his stay in state prison
{129893}{129938}would be cut short,
{129941}{130064}but it was to be no less than|the full period of 90 days.
{130066}{130145}(Dalton)|The judge held|a press conference.
{130148}{130229}Shockwaves went through|the judicial community.
{130231}{130291}Ajudge holding|a press conference
{130293}{130418}regarding a pending case:|Totally unheard of.
{130467}{130608}He said that he intended now|to sentence Polanski in absentia.
{130610}{130739}So I prepared the challenge|for cause to disqualify a judge.
{130741}{130804}If you do this,|you're required to prove
{130806}{130864}that there are|actual prejudices, you know,
{130866}{130919}existing by the judge,|and you can no... -
{130921}{131005}you can't have a fair trial|or a fair hearing before him.
{131007}{131120}I showed the declaration|to Roger Gunson.
{131122}{131159}He read it very carefully.
{131161}{131183}He agreed.
{131185}{131207}"That's true.
{131209}{131233}"That's what happened.
{131235}{131301}I will back you up|if that need be."
{131303}{131401}The judge was furious.
{131403}{131476}He knew the statements|in the declaration were all true.
{131478}{131502}He knew that I knew it,
{131505}{131536}he knew that Gunson knew it,
{131538}{131616}and he knew that|Larry Silver knew parts of it.
{131618}{131719}And so there was nothing|he could do but step aside.
{131721}{131776}He was through, and he knew it.
{132117}{132166}(Geimer)|I was young, but the way I felt was,
{132169}{132218}the judge was enjoying|the publicity,
{132221}{132261}and he didn't care about|what happened to me,
{132263}{132309}and he didn't care about|what happened to Polanski.
{132312}{132380}He was, like, orchestrating|some little show,
{132382}{132414}you know,|that I didn't want to be in.
{132418}{132478}I clearly hold no grief|for Mr. Polanski,
{132480}{132558}and obviously what he did|to Samantha, my client,
{132560}{132634}was wrong, outrageous,|but nevertheless,
{132636}{132677}he was supposed to be|treated fairly in court,
{132679}{132701}and he clearly was not.
{132703}{132816}I'm not surprised that he left|under those circumstances.
{132818}{132879}(woman)|Really?
{132882}{132975}Yeah.
{133038}{133107}[Loud sizzling]
{133111}{133168}[Laughs]
{133183}{133275}Well, Clive, it was|a wonderful idea to do this... -

{133381}{133439}But the lunch is getting|into a dinner now,
{133441}{133527}and in case if you have in mind|finishing this interview,
