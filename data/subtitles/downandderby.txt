1
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:01,570
Synced and corrected by R3V0LV3R.

2
00:02:15,428 --> 00:02:17,328
That was easy.

3
00:02:19,065 --> 00:02:20,362
My name is Phil Davis.

4
00:02:20,433 --> 00:02:22,367
I was a kid who could

5
00:02:22,435 --> 00:02:25,734
outrun, out jump or out hit
anyone in my class.

6
00:02:25,805 --> 00:02:32,210
And then, this kid from California named
Ace Montana moved to town.

7
00:02:32,278 --> 00:02:35,372
Just say the word,
and I'll take him out right now.

8
00:02:35,448 --> 00:02:39,384
Naw, leave him alone,
Big Jimmy.

9
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:41,647
I had a feeling
he was gonna win.

10
00:02:41,721 --> 00:02:43,154
Shut up, Blaine.

11
00:02:43,223 --> 00:02:44,815
Well, I did.

12
00:02:44,891 --> 00:02:47,519
Ever since then,
Ace has been number one,

13
00:02:47,594 --> 00:02:49,459
and I've been number two.

14
00:02:49,529 --> 00:02:53,021
I should have changed my name to "Deuce".

15
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,031
"Deuce" Davis.

16
00:02:55,602 --> 00:02:56,626
Come on!

17
00:02:56,703 --> 00:02:58,136
Not much has changed
over the years.

18
00:02:58,204 --> 00:03:01,264
Big Jimmy hasn't grown an inch
since fifth grade,

19
00:03:01,341 --> 00:03:04,071
and Blaine is... well, still Blaine.

20
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:05,770
All right guys,
let's play some good defense.

21
00:03:05,845 --> 00:03:07,176
That's it.
Don't let them score.

22
00:03:07,247 --> 00:03:10,341
And Ace...

23
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:11,610
is still number one.

24
00:03:15,688 --> 00:03:16,620
Keep it down here...

25
00:03:16,689 --> 00:03:18,213
Keep it down here, Brady.

26
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:19,883
Come on, Brady!

27
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,085
Now, Brady!

28
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,127
Shoot it now!

29
00:03:25,465 --> 00:03:27,262
Yes!

30
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:28,857
Yeah! Yeah!

31
00:03:28,935 --> 00:03:30,197
Time out.

32
00:03:35,942 --> 00:03:37,500
Yeah!

33
00:03:37,577 --> 00:03:39,442
Come on, Big Jimmy,
keep 'em going.

34
00:03:39,512 --> 00:03:40,444
Hey, Brady,

35
00:03:40,513 --> 00:03:41,946
slammin' shot, man.

36
00:03:42,015 --> 00:03:43,107
Ah, thanks.

37
00:03:45,285 --> 00:03:46,582
Dude, dude...

38
00:03:46,653 --> 00:03:47,711
I didn't see you there.

39
00:03:47,787 --> 00:03:49,345
Come on. Walk away, Brady,
walk away, pal.

40
00:03:49,422 --> 00:03:53,483
Sweet shot.

41
00:03:53,559 --> 00:03:55,891
Brady, nice shot, nice shot.

42
00:03:55,962 --> 00:03:57,930
Two seconds.
Two seconds.

43
00:03:57,997 --> 00:03:59,055
That's all they've got, okay?

44
00:03:59,132 --> 00:04:02,033
Everybody knows the ball
is gonna go to A.J.

45
00:04:02,101 --> 00:04:03,898
A.J.
Don't foul him.

46
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,938
Whatever you do, don't foul him,
understand?

47
00:04:06,005 --> 00:04:07,768
And if you do foul him,

48
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,467
make sure he goes
to the hospital,

49
00:04:09,542 --> 00:04:10,474
not the foul line!

50
00:04:10,543 --> 00:04:11,823
Hey, hey. Okay,
come on, come on.

51
00:04:11,878 --> 00:04:13,239
Here we go, here we go,
here we go!

52
00:04:13,246 --> 00:04:14,838
Let's go!

53
00:04:14,914 --> 00:04:16,677
All right, come on, guys!

54
00:04:16,749 --> 00:04:18,341
Come on, guys, we got him.

55
00:04:18,418 --> 00:04:20,579
We got him!

56
00:04:20,653 --> 00:04:21,984
Hey, hey, don't say that
to those kids.

57
00:04:22,055 --> 00:04:22,987
Ah!

58
00:04:23,056 --> 00:04:25,718
A lot can happen
in two seconds.

59
00:04:25,792 --> 00:04:27,123
Remember Christian Laettner?

60
00:04:27,193 --> 00:04:28,990
Regional finals...

61
00:04:29,062 --> 00:04:30,086
Seriously, that's.

62
00:04:30,163 --> 00:04:32,097
Ace Montana over there.

63
00:04:32,165 --> 00:04:33,655
What makes you think
he can lose?

64
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:35,598
Hey, Blaine, would you shut up?

65
00:04:35,668 --> 00:04:36,692
Both of you chill.

66
00:04:36,769 --> 00:04:38,249
We got "fake bake"
by the short hairs.

67
00:04:38,304 --> 00:04:40,704
Ain't no way these little kids
are gonna take the ball full court

68
00:04:40,773 --> 00:04:42,104
and score
with two seconds left.

69
00:04:42,175 --> 00:04:43,233
It would take a miracle.

70
00:04:43,309 --> 00:04:44,742
Come on you guys!

71
00:04:44,811 --> 00:04:45,743
Defense!

72
00:04:45,812 --> 00:04:49,145
Or a "Hail Mary" at half court.

73
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,925
It's in.

74
00:05:09,502 --> 00:05:10,469
Yep.

75
00:05:19,245 --> 00:05:20,212
Yep.

76
00:05:25,251 --> 00:05:26,218
No!

77
00:05:27,253 --> 00:05:28,185
Ah!

78
00:05:28,254 --> 00:05:29,186
Whoa, Phil.

79
00:05:29,255 --> 00:05:32,156
Phil, what, bad dream?

80
00:05:32,225 --> 00:05:35,661
Oh... oh, a nightmare,
it was a nightmare.

81
00:05:35,728 --> 00:05:37,787
I dreamt that, uh...

82
00:05:37,864 --> 00:05:39,832
oh, that Brady's team
was in the city basketball

83
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:41,833
finals, and, and,
we were up by two,

84
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:45,496
and... and... and A.J. took
a shot from half court,

85
00:05:45,571 --> 00:05:49,029
with no time left,
and he beat us.

86
00:05:49,108 --> 00:05:50,336
Oh, man.

87
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:51,468
Phil.

88
00:05:51,544 --> 00:05:52,738
Phil.

89
00:05:57,617 --> 00:05:59,107
Oh, that's it!

90
00:05:59,185 --> 00:06:00,117
That's it!

91
00:06:00,186 --> 00:06:01,118
We're moving.

92
00:06:01,187 --> 00:06:02,484
Oh, Phil!

93
00:06:02,555 --> 00:06:05,752
Do we have to go through this
every time Ace beats you

94
00:06:05,825 --> 00:06:06,883
at something?

95
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,221
Something?
Something...

96
00:06:08,294 --> 00:06:09,693
Well, how 'bout everything

97
00:06:09,762 --> 00:06:11,992
and now its starting
all over again with... with Ace's

98
00:06:12,064 --> 00:06:13,622
clone A.J. and... and Brady!

99
00:06:13,699 --> 00:06:14,631
Oh...

100
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,099
Phil, its past 3:00.

101
00:06:16,169 --> 00:06:17,101
I'm never gonna make

102
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,899
my spinning class.

103
00:06:18,971 --> 00:06:21,667
Why did he have to move here
and ruin my life?

104
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:24,642
Ace Montana!

105
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,508
What kind of a name is that?!

106
00:06:33,019 --> 00:06:35,852
I'll tell you what kind
of name it is.

107
00:06:35,922 --> 00:06:37,947
It's the coolest damn name
I've ever heard.

108
00:06:40,793 --> 00:06:42,226
Something exciting has come up...

109
00:06:42,295 --> 00:06:43,990
and you are the guy that can handle it.

110
00:06:44,063 --> 00:06:46,554
Are you familiar
with the Japanese conglomerate,

111
00:06:46,632 --> 00:06:48,429
Yakimoto Technology
and Communications?

112
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:49,900
Are you kidding?

113
00:06:49,969 --> 00:06:51,402
Yeah, I mean, we...

114
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:53,063
we all use Yakimoto
cell phones, right?

115
00:06:53,139 --> 00:06:54,071
Yes.

116
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,232
Guess what?

117
00:06:55,308 --> 00:06:58,175
They saw one of our ads

118
00:06:58,244 --> 00:06:59,074
in a magazine.

119
00:06:59,145 --> 00:07:00,112
They loved the copy.

120
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,972
This is a huge, Phil!

121
00:07:03,049 --> 00:07:04,607
If we are chosen,

122
00:07:04,684 --> 00:07:07,915
this is ten million dollars
in revenue!

123
00:07:07,987 --> 00:07:11,320
Right, but, uh,
Stewart's your... your go-to guy.

124
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:12,322
What about Stewart?

125
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:13,323
No, Phil.

126
00:07:13,392 --> 00:07:14,791
You're gonna be the go-to guy.

127
00:07:14,861 --> 00:07:16,886
I need you to go home,
I need you to concentrate.

128
00:07:16,963 --> 00:07:17,987
I need you

129
00:07:18,064 --> 00:07:19,190
to put on that thinking cap of yours.

130
00:07:19,265 --> 00:07:21,631
I want you to come up
with a bunch of ideas

131
00:07:21,701 --> 00:07:23,532
that are going to blow
these guys away.

132
00:07:23,603 --> 00:07:25,093
What I want to know, Phil,
is are you up for this?

133
00:07:25,171 --> 00:07:26,798
Are you kidding?

134
00:07:26,873 --> 00:07:29,637
I am... I am so up for this, Larry.
I am ready.

135
00:07:29,709 --> 00:07:31,700
Great.

136
00:07:31,777 --> 00:07:34,007
Look, we're going to meet
on this tomorrow, 4:00.

137
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,047
I'll be there Larry.

138
00:07:35,114 --> 00:07:36,046
And thank you so much.

139
00:07:36,115 --> 00:07:38,310
And I will not let you down.

140
00:07:38,384 --> 00:07:40,409
This is really gonna be fun.

141
00:07:40,486 --> 00:07:41,783
Now, don't forget,

142
00:07:41,854 --> 00:07:43,788
you're supposed to do it
with your dad's supervision.

143
00:07:43,856 --> 00:07:45,380
The instructions
are in the box, okay?

144
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,653
And then, there's gonna be

145
00:07:47,727 --> 00:07:50,252
a big race at the rec center
for all the scouts.

146
00:07:50,329 --> 00:07:52,058
Okay, who wants
an ice cream sandwich?

147
00:07:52,131 --> 00:07:53,098
I do! I do!

148
00:07:53,165 --> 00:07:55,065
Ah, everybody.

149
00:07:55,134 --> 00:07:56,829
Ah, this is gonna be cool.

150
00:07:56,903 --> 00:07:58,302
Yeah!

151
00:07:58,371 --> 00:08:02,034
Don't even waste your time
making a car.

152
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:03,628
Me and my dad
are gonna win this thing.

153
00:08:03,643 --> 00:08:04,940
What was that, A.J.?

154
00:08:05,011 --> 00:08:06,945
Oh, nothing, Mrs. Davis.

155
00:08:07,013 --> 00:08:09,413
I was just saying how much fun
the Pinewood Derby's gonna be.

156
00:08:14,453 --> 00:08:15,647
Okay.

157
00:08:24,997 --> 00:08:26,589
" Down and derby."

158
00:08:35,808 --> 00:08:37,139
Hey.

159
00:08:37,209 --> 00:08:40,406
" Well, it's gettin'
on down and derby."

160
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:41,776
Hey.

161
00:08:41,847 --> 00:08:43,644
" Well, it's gettin'
on down and derby."

162
00:08:46,686 --> 00:08:48,085
Oh, Dad!
Dad!

163
00:08:48,154 --> 00:08:49,212
Hey.

164
00:08:49,288 --> 00:08:51,756
Look... we're gonna be
in the Pinewood Derby.

165
00:08:51,824 --> 00:08:53,185
You're supposed
to help me make it.

166
00:08:54,026 --> 00:08:54,958
Oh...

167
00:08:55,027 --> 00:08:56,722
Oh, wow, that's, uh...

168
00:08:56,796 --> 00:08:57,728
it's cool, huh?

169
00:08:57,797 --> 00:08:59,628
Yeah, that's really...

170
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:00,825
Yeah...

171
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:02,993
Son, this is gonna be so fun.

172
00:09:03,069 --> 00:09:05,469
I remember doing this
when I was a kid.

173
00:09:05,538 --> 00:09:06,937
Hey, um, Brady,

174
00:09:07,006 --> 00:09:08,337
did all the kids
get one of these?

175
00:09:08,407 --> 00:09:09,339
Yeah.

176
00:09:09,408 --> 00:09:10,466
Mom gave them to us.

177
00:09:10,543 --> 00:09:12,101
Uh-huh, yeah.

178
00:09:12,178 --> 00:09:14,009
Oh, that's so great.

179
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,480
Hey, should be fun
for the kids, huh?

180
00:09:16,549 --> 00:09:17,914
Yeah.

181
00:09:17,984 --> 00:09:19,611
Who do you think
you're kiddin', Ace?

182
00:09:20,753 --> 00:09:22,277
Yeah, okay.

183
00:09:22,355 --> 00:09:24,516
Hey, Dad, look what I got.

184
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:26,490
It's a new Pinewood Derby car!

185
00:09:43,142 --> 00:09:44,302
Get in the house, Danny.

186
00:09:44,377 --> 00:09:45,571
Give me the car, Dad.

187
00:09:45,645 --> 00:09:46,577
I've got the car,
just get in the house.

188
00:09:46,646 --> 00:09:47,874
But Dad...

189
00:09:47,947 --> 00:09:50,142
Danny, get your little butt
in the house, go on.

190
00:09:50,216 --> 00:09:51,148
Why don't you go inside, son.

191
00:09:51,217 --> 00:09:52,309
Brady, go see...

192
00:09:52,385 --> 00:09:53,477
if your mom needs help
with dinner.

193
00:09:53,552 --> 00:09:54,484
All right.

194
00:09:54,553 --> 00:09:56,043
N-n-no, I-I-I...
I've got this.

195
00:09:56,122 --> 00:09:57,180
I've got it.

196
00:09:57,256 --> 00:09:58,814
It's okay, it's safe with me.

197
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:00,518
Go on.

198
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:44,664
Can you have it here

199
00:10:44,737 --> 00:10:46,102
first thing in the morning?

200
00:10:46,172 --> 00:10:48,970
Yeah, I'll take the book
and the how-to video.

201
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,771
No, all my info's on the order form.

202
00:10:51,844 --> 00:10:53,243
All right, thanks.

203
00:10:53,312 --> 00:10:57,271
Oh... you are mine, Ace.

204
00:10:57,349 --> 00:10:59,078
I'm back...

205
00:10:59,151 --> 00:11:01,745
I am gonna own you.

206
00:11:02,955 --> 00:11:04,013
Hey, Dad, it's dinner!

207
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:14,857
Yeah.

208
00:11:19,305 --> 00:11:20,363
All right.

209
00:11:20,439 --> 00:11:21,701
N-n-n-no,
hey, hey, hey.

210
00:11:21,774 --> 00:11:22,706
What's the matter?

211
00:11:22,775 --> 00:11:23,742
We... well, le... let's...

212
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:27,006
let's just...
look at it for a minute.

213
00:11:33,853 --> 00:11:34,820
N-n-no, n-n-no,

214
00:11:34,887 --> 00:11:36,548
no no.

215
00:11:36,622 --> 00:11:40,285
See, l-l-l thought
we were just... just looking.

216
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:42,122
I thought we already did look.

217
00:11:42,194 --> 00:11:43,354
Phil.

218
00:11:43,429 --> 00:11:45,260
I have heard

219
00:11:45,331 --> 00:11:47,265
that this can happen
with Pinewood Derby cars.

220
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,630
But it's not gonna happen
in this house.

221
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:49,633
Give...
Give... Dad!

222
00:11:50,703 --> 00:11:51,692
Dad!

223
00:11:51,771 --> 00:11:52,703
Phil, this is Brady's car.

224
00:11:52,772 --> 00:11:53,704
You have to share.

225
00:11:53,773 --> 00:11:54,705
Yeah!

226
00:11:54,774 --> 00:11:55,763
He's supposed to make it

227
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:57,069
with your supervision.

228
00:12:00,513 --> 00:12:02,947
Like the manual says.

229
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:04,482
Here you go.

230
00:12:05,718 --> 00:12:08,152
Now, this is the car
I want to make!

231
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,187
Okay.

232
00:12:12,391 --> 00:12:13,415
It's pretty cool, huh?

233
00:12:13,492 --> 00:12:16,518
Oh, honey, that's really cool!

234
00:12:16,595 --> 00:12:19,428
Isn't that good, Phil?

235
00:12:19,498 --> 00:12:23,025
Yeah, you see, Dad, you know,
I thought we could slope the nose,

236
00:12:23,102 --> 00:12:24,899
so air could hit it,
and it could make it go faster.

237
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:28,371
Oh, well... yeah, I think
that's, uh, that's fine.

238
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:29,771
If you're not concerned
about winning,

239
00:12:29,842 --> 00:12:32,072
I think that's fine.

240
00:12:32,144 --> 00:12:33,475
Oh, come on, Phil!

241
00:12:33,546 --> 00:12:34,570
What?

242
00:12:34,647 --> 00:12:36,911
Well, what's wrong
with it, Dad?

243
00:12:36,982 --> 00:12:39,917
Well, I...
the drag coefficient alone...

244
00:12:39,985 --> 00:12:41,282
But, now...

245
00:12:43,489 --> 00:12:45,650
Yeah, yeah.

246
00:12:51,197 --> 00:12:54,257
If you're interested
in winning,

247
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:58,235
this is your car!

248
00:12:58,304 --> 00:13:01,034
When... when did you have time
to make these?

249
00:13:01,106 --> 00:13:03,336
Oh, I had 'em drawn up, uh,

250
00:13:03,409 --> 00:13:05,206
the minute I found out
we were having a boy.

251
00:13:05,277 --> 00:13:07,040
Yeah, I've been saving 'em
for Brady's first Derby.

252
00:13:07,112 --> 00:13:08,477
It's...

253
00:13:08,547 --> 00:13:10,139
What do you think?

254
00:13:10,216 --> 00:13:13,447
It's... it's cool, Dad,
but...

255
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,146
I'd really rather

256
00:13:15,221 --> 00:13:16,813
make this one.

257
00:13:19,859 --> 00:13:20,951
Okay.

258
00:13:21,026 --> 00:13:22,618
Come on, Dad.

259
00:13:22,695 --> 00:13:23,627
No, no, no, it's okay.

260
00:13:23,696 --> 00:13:24,993
I can see that I am not...

261
00:13:25,064 --> 00:13:27,396
needed for this.

262
00:13:27,466 --> 00:13:29,058
Sit down, Phil.

263
00:13:29,134 --> 00:13:31,967
No, no, no, that's okay.
Go ahead and build... that car.

264
00:13:32,037 --> 00:13:33,834
But when you win the most
cautious driver award,

265
00:13:33,906 --> 00:13:35,237
don't come crying to me.

266
00:13:35,307 --> 00:13:36,672
But Dad, we can win this thing.

267
00:13:36,742 --> 00:13:38,266
Where are you going, Phil?

268
00:13:38,344 --> 00:13:40,005
No, I, you know, I really
don't have time for this.

269
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,637
I've got a lot of work to do

270
00:13:41,714 --> 00:13:45,377
on the Yakimoto campaign,
so, I...

271
00:13:45,451 --> 00:13:47,749
Mom!

272
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,958
Okay, you are in there,

273
00:13:54,026 --> 00:13:56,551
and I'm gonna find you.

274
00:13:56,629 --> 00:14:00,087
And, I will find you.

275
00:14:00,165 --> 00:14:01,097
Dad?

276
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:02,247
In fact, I can see you now.

277
00:14:02,268 --> 00:14:03,200
Dad?

278
00:14:03,269 --> 00:14:04,395
What?

279
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:07,371
Don't touch the wood, okay?

280
00:14:07,439 --> 00:14:10,567
The paint doesn't lay right.

281
00:14:10,643 --> 00:14:12,008
Okay?

282
00:14:12,077 --> 00:14:14,602
Look, there's something I want
you to do though, okay?

283
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,375
I want you to pick out the color.

284
00:14:16,448 --> 00:14:19,281
How about blue?

285
00:14:19,351 --> 00:14:21,444
Uh...

286
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,748
What about green?

287
00:14:22,821 --> 00:14:25,756
Green is...

288
00:14:25,824 --> 00:14:27,189
Todd!

289
00:14:27,259 --> 00:14:29,625
For the last time, get to bed!

290
00:14:29,695 --> 00:14:31,560
She's right, buddy, okay?

291
00:14:31,630 --> 00:14:33,222
Will you... will you think
about colors for me though?

292
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:34,425
Mm-hmm.

293
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,020
All right, I'll see you
in the morning.

294
00:14:43,142 --> 00:14:45,542
Slow down, slow down.

295
00:14:50,516 --> 00:14:52,609
Slow down.

296
00:14:52,685 --> 00:14:55,119
So, what it all boils

297
00:14:55,187 --> 00:14:56,119
down to is...

298
00:14:56,188 --> 00:14:59,521
Remember, it's Danny's car.

299
00:14:59,591 --> 00:15:03,618
You got it, love chunks.

300
00:15:03,696 --> 00:15:05,960
Dad.

301
00:15:06,031 --> 00:15:06,963
Dad.

302
00:15:07,032 --> 00:15:07,964
Huh?

303
00:15:08,033 --> 00:15:09,159
You were saying?

304
00:15:09,234 --> 00:15:11,634
Oh, oh, yeah, um...

305
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:13,899
what it all boils down to is

306
00:15:13,973 --> 00:15:16,066
if you can't run with the big dogs,

307
00:15:16,141 --> 00:15:17,665
you'd better stay on the porch.

308
00:15:17,743 --> 00:15:19,335
What's that

309
00:15:19,411 --> 00:15:20,901
supposed to mean?

310
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:24,643
Winning Pinewood Derby cars
are made by dads,

311
00:15:24,717 --> 00:15:26,514
the "big dogs."

312
00:15:26,585 --> 00:15:27,711
But, that's not fair!

313
00:15:27,786 --> 00:15:29,777
Dads are only supposed to supervise.

314
00:15:29,855 --> 00:15:31,516
That's what Mrs. Davis told us.

315
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,354
And she's right!

316
00:15:34,426 --> 00:15:36,189
But, life isn't fair.

317
00:15:36,261 --> 00:15:39,526
So, what I need to know is,
"little dog",

318
00:15:39,598 --> 00:15:43,728
do you want to make your own car
and take last place?

319
00:15:43,802 --> 00:15:46,464
Or do you want
a "big dog" to make it

320
00:15:46,538 --> 00:15:47,937
and kick some butt?

321
00:15:52,544 --> 00:15:54,341
I just thought
it would be more fun

322
00:15:54,413 --> 00:15:55,971
to make my own car.

323
00:16:00,386 --> 00:16:01,478
Okay.

324
00:16:01,553 --> 00:16:03,748
Come on, baby.

325
00:16:03,822 --> 00:16:06,086
I respect that.

326
00:16:06,158 --> 00:16:08,786
But, if you need any help,
you just let me know, okay?

327
00:16:08,861 --> 00:16:09,793
Okay.

328
00:16:09,862 --> 00:16:10,829
Hey!

329
00:16:10,896 --> 00:16:11,828
Thanks, Dad.

330
00:16:11,897 --> 00:16:15,526
Anytime, pal.

331
00:16:15,601 --> 00:16:18,661
Hey, Shaquille!

332
00:16:18,737 --> 00:16:21,001
Your grandpa has a power saw
in his garage.

333
00:16:21,073 --> 00:16:22,370
You can use that to cut it.

334
00:16:22,441 --> 00:16:24,534
Well, do you think
he'd help me?

335
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:26,475
Of course he'd help you.

336
00:16:26,545 --> 00:16:27,773
No, no, K-Kim!

337
00:16:27,846 --> 00:16:29,780
Kim, no no no.

338
00:16:29,848 --> 00:16:32,248
No, I-I-I-I do not

339
00:16:32,317 --> 00:16:34,080
want your dad getting involved!

340
00:16:34,153 --> 00:16:35,633
He doesn't have a clue
about how to...

341
00:16:35,654 --> 00:16:36,746
build one of these things.

342
00:16:36,822 --> 00:16:40,280
And I don't want Brady
around all that power machinery!

343
00:16:40,359 --> 00:16:43,954
He needs supervision.

344
00:16:44,029 --> 00:16:46,463
From his dad.

345
00:16:46,532 --> 00:16:50,093
Like it says in the manual.

346
00:16:50,169 --> 00:16:52,399
M-may I sit there,
please?

347
00:16:52,471 --> 00:16:53,438
Mom?

348
00:16:53,505 --> 00:16:54,597
Oh.

349
00:16:54,673 --> 00:16:55,765
It's okay.

350
00:16:58,477 --> 00:17:01,071
So... thank you.
I'll just...

351
00:17:01,146 --> 00:17:02,135
Okay.

352
00:17:02,214 --> 00:17:03,511
Excuse me.
Okay.

353
00:17:03,582 --> 00:17:05,447
Okay.

354
00:17:05,517 --> 00:17:07,485
Okay.

355
00:17:07,553 --> 00:17:10,021
No, we're, uh, we're fine.

356
00:17:10,089 --> 00:17:11,852
Yeah, we've got this covered.

357
00:17:11,924 --> 00:17:13,915
Oh, sorry.

358
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,289
Yeah, just us guys.

359
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,887
Okay, okay, thank you.

360
00:17:18,964 --> 00:17:20,488
All righty.

361
00:17:20,566 --> 00:17:21,498
No, no, no, no.

362
00:17:21,567 --> 00:17:22,534
Come on, Dad!

363
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:23,727
Let me, let me,
let me just, uh,

364
00:17:23,802 --> 00:17:25,133
let me just look it over.

365
00:17:25,204 --> 00:17:26,228
This is complicated.

366
00:17:52,064 --> 00:17:54,931
Big Jimmy, what's going on?

367
00:18:20,592 --> 00:18:23,755
Phil!
I'm leaving.

368
00:18:23,829 --> 00:18:25,660
You... you have a good day.

369
00:18:25,731 --> 00:18:26,698
I-I love you.

370
00:18:26,765 --> 00:18:27,891
Love you, too.

371
00:18:27,966 --> 00:18:29,433
Bye-bye.

372
00:18:46,952 --> 00:18:48,351
Yeah...

373
00:18:55,594 --> 00:18:57,027
it's him!

374
00:19:31,863 --> 00:19:33,956
Okay...

375
00:19:34,032 --> 00:19:34,964
Phil Davis.

376
00:19:35,033 --> 00:19:36,591
Ah, that's, uh... hi.

377
00:19:36,668 --> 00:19:38,499
Thank you.
That's...

378
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:42,438
Oh, it's a, potato masher,
slicer-dicer deal.

379
00:19:42,507 --> 00:19:44,304
You've see it on channel 3.

380
00:19:44,376 --> 00:19:46,207
Uh, Jimmy...

381
00:19:46,278 --> 00:19:47,905
it's supposed to be Big Jimmy!

382
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:51,814
Sorry, Big Jimmy.

383
00:19:51,883 --> 00:19:54,511
Angel joined a book club.

384
00:19:54,586 --> 00:19:55,780
Oh.

385
00:19:55,854 --> 00:19:58,152
Yeah.

386
00:19:58,223 --> 00:20:00,214
I guess you must be, uh,
Blaine... Moons... man?

387
00:20:00,292 --> 00:20:01,259
That's right, yep.

388
00:20:05,364 --> 00:20:07,855
Shoe trees.

389
00:20:10,435 --> 00:20:11,732
Okay.

390
00:20:11,803 --> 00:20:14,294
Now, if I could get you guys
to, uh, sign right here...

391
00:20:22,748 --> 00:20:23,715
Thanks.

392
00:20:26,285 --> 00:20:28,253
Derby freaks!

393
00:21:00,452 --> 00:21:02,420
Hi, Blaine, you...

394
00:21:02,487 --> 00:21:05,217
doing a little project?

395
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:09,090
Picture frames.

396
00:21:29,448 --> 00:21:30,710
Hey.
Hey, Big Jimmy.

397
00:21:30,782 --> 00:21:32,044
Hey, howdy.

398
00:21:32,117 --> 00:21:34,108
Looks like it's neighbor day.
I just saw Blaine.

399
00:21:34,186 --> 00:21:35,778
Oh, yeah, yeah.

400
00:21:35,854 --> 00:21:36,843
Says he's working on his deck.

401
00:21:36,922 --> 00:21:38,184
What are you here for?

402
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:41,020
Ah, Kim, you know, Kim...
she's, uh, she's been

403
00:21:41,093 --> 00:21:42,253
just nagging me, you know...

404
00:21:44,096 --> 00:21:45,825
I got to organize the... the
gar... I'm building some shelves.

405
00:21:45,897 --> 00:21:46,921
Uh, what about you?

406
00:21:46,998 --> 00:21:50,195
Uh, well, I got the week off,
so I thought I'd start working

407
00:21:50,268 --> 00:21:51,360
on the fence, you know.

408
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:52,425
You know what they say.

409
00:21:52,504 --> 00:21:54,438
"Good fences make good
neighbors", huh?

410
00:21:55,874 --> 00:21:57,307
Yeah, okay, all right.

411
00:21:57,376 --> 00:21:58,308
Listen, I gotta go

412
00:21:58,377 --> 00:21:59,309
all right?

413
00:21:59,378 --> 00:22:00,675
I got a lot to do.
Hey...

414
00:22:00,746 --> 00:22:02,771
Good luck with those shelves.

415
00:22:02,848 --> 00:22:05,112
Shelves... oh, yeah,
the shelves... okay then.

416
00:22:18,397 --> 00:22:20,477
So, uh, how's everyone's
Pinewood Derby coming along?

417
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:24,425
You mean, how's my dad's
Pinewood Derby coming?

418
00:22:24,503 --> 00:22:28,803
I can't wait till I'm a dad,
so I can build my own car and race it.

419
00:22:28,874 --> 00:22:31,570
"You'll get your turn
when we get to the fun stuff."

420
00:22:31,643 --> 00:22:33,736
Your dad says that too?

421
00:22:33,812 --> 00:22:34,744
Yeah.

422
00:22:34,813 --> 00:22:36,713
Yeah, mine too.

423
00:22:40,385 --> 00:22:41,977
Hey.

424
00:22:42,053 --> 00:22:43,680
What's going on?

425
00:22:43,755 --> 00:22:45,552
Oh, hey, Mom.
We're just hanging out.

426
00:22:45,624 --> 00:22:48,616
What have you guys
been doing all day?

427
00:22:48,693 --> 00:22:51,184
Nothing.

428
00:22:56,134 --> 00:22:57,362
What's your dad doing?

429
00:22:57,436 --> 00:23:01,304
Same thing that Danny and Todd's
dads are doing.

430
00:23:05,444 --> 00:23:07,503
And what might that be?

431
00:23:07,579 --> 00:23:09,638
You don't want to know, Mrs. Davis.

432
00:23:17,422 --> 00:23:18,912
She's gonna freak!

433
00:23:18,990 --> 00:23:21,356
Hey guys, let's go down to
the dairy and get an ice cream,

434
00:23:21,426 --> 00:23:23,155
I'm buying.

435
00:23:23,228 --> 00:23:25,219
Well... where'd you get
the money?

436
00:23:25,297 --> 00:23:27,390
I asked my dad if I could help
him with the Pinewood Derby.

437
00:23:27,466 --> 00:23:29,991
He said, "When we get
to the fun stuff."

438
00:23:30,068 --> 00:23:32,127
And then he gave me this
to get rid of me.

439
00:23:32,204 --> 00:23:33,136
Whoa!

440
00:23:33,205 --> 00:23:35,070
What a minute!

441
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:37,506
I think I got a great idea.

442
00:23:47,085 --> 00:23:48,143
What is going on?

443
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,517
What is this mess?

444
00:23:49,588 --> 00:23:50,520
Oh!

445
00:23:52,624 --> 00:23:55,354
Hah, you scared me.

446
00:23:55,427 --> 00:23:56,724
No, Phil!

447
00:23:56,795 --> 00:23:57,921
You are scaring me.

448
00:23:57,996 --> 00:23:58,985
Oh, no, no, no.

449
00:23:59,064 --> 00:24:00,998
No, no, no, not...
not... not to worry.

450
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:02,226
Not to worry.

451
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,063
No, this...
this is all gonna be...

452
00:24:04,135 --> 00:24:05,966
this will be out of here once...
once the Derby's over.

453
00:24:06,037 --> 00:24:07,732
The Derby?

454
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:12,241
Why the bedroom?

455
00:24:12,310 --> 00:24:15,302
Why not the basement
or the garage?

456
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,711
What?
I'm... I-I-I-couldn't...

457
00:24:16,781 --> 00:24:18,181
I'm sorry I couldn't
hear you, the...

458
00:24:18,183 --> 00:24:19,912
I said

459
00:24:19,985 --> 00:24:20,917
why the bedroom?

460
00:24:20,986 --> 00:24:22,749
Why not the garage
or the basement?

461
00:24:22,821 --> 00:24:24,118
Well, uh...

462
00:24:24,189 --> 00:24:26,316
this... this is the...
the safest place.

463
00:24:26,391 --> 00:24:29,189
The... the safest place?

464
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:32,526
I don't want anyone to know

465
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:35,657
I'm getting ready for the Derby.

466
00:24:35,734 --> 00:24:39,397
Oh...

467
00:24:39,471 --> 00:24:40,529
Now I get it.

468
00:24:40,605 --> 00:24:41,867
Oh, don't worry.

469
00:24:41,940 --> 00:24:43,635
Your secret's safe with me.

470
00:24:43,708 --> 00:24:45,903
I won't tell a soul.

471
00:24:47,913 --> 00:24:50,143
Phil, you need a shrink!

472
00:24:50,215 --> 00:24:51,910
Yeah, hey, what do you think
of this track?

473
00:24:51,983 --> 00:24:52,983
It's pretty sweet, right?

474
00:24:53,051 --> 00:24:56,179
The track?
Oh, it's a work of art, yeah.

475
00:24:56,254 --> 00:24:58,586
But, how do we get in the bed?

476
00:24:58,657 --> 00:24:59,919
The bed?

477
00:24:59,991 --> 00:25:01,652
Oh, no, oh, that's...
now, that's not...

478
00:25:01,726 --> 00:25:02,818
that's not so bad, here,
watch, watch...

479
00:25:02,894 --> 00:25:04,293
Excuse me, just...
pardon me.

480
00:25:04,362 --> 00:25:06,193
Excuse me.
Just put...

481
00:25:06,264 --> 00:25:07,561
Put this through.

482
00:25:07,632 --> 00:25:10,294
Right here like that.
Then you...

483
00:25:10,368 --> 00:25:11,699
Right like that.
Cozy like this.

484
00:25:11,770 --> 00:25:13,131
See, I designed it
so the clearance

485
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:14,196
is just high enough, so that,

486
00:25:14,272 --> 00:25:15,432
you know, we... we can...
we can roll over.

487
00:25:15,507 --> 00:25:16,565
That's you over here.

488
00:25:16,641 --> 00:25:17,722
"Hi, honey, how you doing?"

489
00:25:17,776 --> 00:25:18,834
And... and this is me.
I'm over here.

490
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:19,934
"Oh, hi, honey, I'm...

491
00:25:20,011 --> 00:25:21,569
"Oh, cuddle up over here.
You wanna spoon?

492
00:25:21,646 --> 00:25:22,806
Mm... so cozy."

493
00:25:22,881 --> 00:25:23,848
Phil!

494
00:25:23,915 --> 00:25:24,939
Have you done

495
00:25:25,016 --> 00:25:27,484
anything at all
on the Yakimoto campaign?

496
00:25:29,087 --> 00:25:30,782
Oh! Oh.
The Yakimoto campaign.

497
00:25:30,855 --> 00:25:32,550
Oh, yes, of course,
I've been working on that.

498
00:25:32,624 --> 00:25:33,784
Oh, yeah, uh...

499
00:25:33,858 --> 00:25:35,450
Yeah, and, you know what?

500
00:25:35,527 --> 00:25:38,496
I'll show you.

501
00:25:38,563 --> 00:25:40,724
Oh, yeah!

502
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,391
So, hey, hey!

503
00:25:42,467 --> 00:25:44,025
Relax!

504
00:25:44,102 --> 00:25:45,763
We're gonna win!

505
00:25:47,839 --> 00:25:49,306
Oh, that's, uh, that's mine.

506
00:25:49,374 --> 00:25:51,069
Uh, excuse me.
Pardon me, yeah.

507
00:25:53,311 --> 00:25:54,243
Yeah, it's Phil.

508
00:25:54,312 --> 00:25:55,609
Phil, it's Larry.

509
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,772
Larry?

510
00:25:56,848 --> 00:25:57,888
Larry... Larry... Larry...

511
00:25:57,916 --> 00:25:59,474
Uh...

512
00:25:59,551 --> 00:26:01,883
Oh! Oh, uh, yeah, Larry, hey.
Hey, Larry.

513
00:26:01,953 --> 00:26:03,284
What's going on?

514
00:26:03,355 --> 00:26:04,344
We were supposed to meet

515
00:26:04,422 --> 00:26:05,582
30 minutes ago on the Yaki-

516
00:26:08,893 --> 00:26:10,360
Remember what to say?

517
00:26:10,428 --> 00:26:11,952
Yeah, I think so.

518
00:26:12,030 --> 00:26:13,793
Come on, it's easy!

519
00:26:13,865 --> 00:26:15,856
All right.

520
00:26:15,934 --> 00:26:19,529
The Pinewood Derby, and hey,

521
00:26:19,604 --> 00:26:23,404
if a couple of dummies
like us could do it,

522
00:26:23,475 --> 00:26:24,499
you could too.

523
00:26:24,576 --> 00:26:27,101
But, before we tell you how...

524
00:26:27,178 --> 00:26:29,874
Hey, Dad, it's looking good.

525
00:26:29,948 --> 00:26:34,351
Hey. Hey, champ.
What... what's up buddy?

526
00:26:34,419 --> 00:26:36,410
You know, my friends,

527
00:26:36,488 --> 00:26:40,117
they want me to go to the movies
and then get a pizza, but...

528
00:26:40,191 --> 00:26:41,351
I don't have enough money.

529
00:26:41,426 --> 00:26:43,227
And besides I'd rather stay here
and help you!

530
00:26:43,228 --> 00:26:44,593
Well, hey, that's so...

531
00:26:44,663 --> 00:26:46,062
Oh boy, that's sweet.

532
00:26:46,131 --> 00:26:47,598
That's, that's, uh,
that's sweet, but you know,

533
00:26:47,666 --> 00:26:49,133
you know what?

534
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:50,240
Boy, that's... that's tough.

535
00:26:50,301 --> 00:26:52,030
That's a... that's a tough call.

536
00:26:52,103 --> 00:26:55,038
You know, 'cause, I mean, as much as
I'd like you to stick around here

537
00:26:55,106 --> 00:26:58,269
and, um, help me out, you know,
I know how...

538
00:26:58,343 --> 00:27:00,072
important it is for you
to get out there and...

539
00:27:00,145 --> 00:27:03,012
play with your buddies and...

540
00:27:03,081 --> 00:27:05,845
besides we're not even
to the fun stuff yet.

541
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:06,975
So... so... so...

542
00:27:07,052 --> 00:27:08,849
how much is it for a...
for a movie?

543
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:09,852
What's the...

544
00:27:09,921 --> 00:27:11,855
it's, uh, it's $8.

545
00:27:11,923 --> 00:27:13,413
$8,... take, uh...

546
00:27:13,491 --> 00:27:15,772
Take... take that, take that,
and you go have a good time.

547
00:27:16,394 --> 00:27:18,453
Yeah.

548
00:27:20,632 --> 00:27:21,894
You know what,
this is too much, Dad.

549
00:27:21,966 --> 00:27:22,926
I don't want your money.

550
00:27:22,967 --> 00:27:24,491
I just want to stay here
and help you.

551
00:27:24,569 --> 00:27:26,161
No no no,
I don't want you here!

552
00:27:26,237 --> 00:27:27,437
I mean, I want you to go, I do.

553
00:27:27,439 --> 00:27:28,599
I want you to go.
I want...

554
00:27:28,673 --> 00:27:30,436
Here, you take... take this,
and here's a 20.

555
00:27:30,508 --> 00:27:32,942
Here's a 20, and you take that,
and you have fun

556
00:27:33,011 --> 00:27:34,273
with your friends, now go!

557
00:27:34,345 --> 00:27:36,870
Yeah.
That's gonna be a good time.

558
00:27:36,948 --> 00:27:38,540
Yeah, now, go on, go on.
Go, go, go, go, go.

559
00:27:38,616 --> 00:27:40,447
Yeah!

560
00:27:44,355 --> 00:27:45,287
It worked!

561
00:27:45,356 --> 00:27:46,414
You're a genius!

562
00:27:46,491 --> 00:27:47,458
Let's go!

563
00:28:20,425 --> 00:28:22,825
" Make and break the world
record that is set ."

564
00:28:22,894 --> 00:28:24,054
" You know
they'll never forget ."

565
00:28:24,129 --> 00:28:25,562
" Don't underestimate him yet ."

566
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:28,155
" Because he will succeed
to fill his need for speed"

567
00:28:28,233 --> 00:28:30,895
" it's like a never-ending convo
about insatiable greed ."

568
00:28:34,272 --> 00:28:35,705
Finally!

569
00:28:35,774 --> 00:28:40,643
Finally, we're getting some place
with these numbers.

570
00:28:40,712 --> 00:28:41,940
This is good.

571
00:28:42,013 --> 00:28:43,310
Phil!

572
00:28:43,381 --> 00:28:45,406
Could you come to bed?!
It's 4:00 in the morning.

573
00:28:45,483 --> 00:28:45,983
Yeah.

574
00:28:50,855 --> 00:28:53,346
Just one...
one second.

575
00:28:53,424 --> 00:28:55,892
I just got two more runs,

576
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:00,954
and then I'll be right there.

577
00:29:01,032 --> 00:29:02,260
Am I missing something?

578
00:29:02,333 --> 00:29:04,392
I mean, aren't you allowed
to only race

579
00:29:04,469 --> 00:29:06,164
one Pinewood Derby car?

580
00:29:06,237 --> 00:29:07,465
Oh, yeah, yeah.

581
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:08,665
But according to
the Pinewood Derby Bible,

582
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,004
if you want to win,
you've gotta build a bunch of cars.

583
00:29:11,075 --> 00:29:12,995
And sooner or later,
you come up with that fluke,

584
00:29:13,044 --> 00:29:14,405
that for no logical reason just...

585
00:29:15,046 --> 00:29:15,705
is faster then the rest.

586
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,408
So, see, I'm...

587
00:29:18,483 --> 00:29:22,078
And how fast does that
have to be, Phil?

588
00:29:22,153 --> 00:29:25,680
Well, the all-time world record
is 3.11275 secs.

589
00:29:25,757 --> 00:29:28,726
There is a Pinewood Derby
world record?

590
00:29:28,793 --> 00:29:30,920
Yeah.

591
00:29:33,932 --> 00:29:39,063
Okay, uh, Phil, I'm gonna try
and go back to sleep now!

592
00:29:39,137 --> 00:29:42,664
Yeah, yeah, you go to sleep.

593
00:29:43,908 --> 00:29:45,432
Do you think you could
turn off the light?

594
00:29:45,510 --> 00:29:48,172
Oh!
Yeah, yeah, sure.

595
00:29:48,246 --> 00:29:49,213
Yep.

596
00:29:57,722 --> 00:29:59,212
No, no, no!

597
00:30:02,560 --> 00:30:04,289
Blaine!

598
00:30:04,362 --> 00:30:06,125
I thought you
were coming to bed.

599
00:30:06,197 --> 00:30:07,687
I was.

600
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:10,666
But it looks like I've still
got some more work to do.

601
00:30:16,641 --> 00:30:18,041
" He'll be the last man standing."

602
00:30:18,042 --> 00:30:19,134
" He'll be number one."

603
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,768
" He'll be the first car to finish."

604
00:30:20,845 --> 00:30:21,937
" When the race is won."

605
00:30:23,248 --> 00:30:25,216
I think I can do it.
Yeah.

606
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:34,358
You guys come on, lets go!

607
00:30:37,262 --> 00:30:38,752
Hey, Phil!

608
00:30:38,830 --> 00:30:39,888
Hey.

609
00:30:39,964 --> 00:30:42,831
Hey, yeah.
What, uh, what's up?

610
00:30:42,901 --> 00:30:44,994
Oh, we're just gonna take out
the new ATV's.

611
00:30:45,069 --> 00:30:47,401
Oh!
Oh, wow, yeah.

612
00:30:47,472 --> 00:30:48,672
Where... where'd
you get those?

613
00:30:48,706 --> 00:30:50,264
Oh, there was
a little contest at work,

614
00:30:50,341 --> 00:30:51,381
and they were first prize.

615
00:30:51,442 --> 00:30:52,670
Oh, you...

616
00:30:52,744 --> 00:30:54,837
that's, well, that's... that's good...
Good for you, that's...

617
00:30:54,913 --> 00:30:55,880
Hey, how's your boy

618
00:30:55,947 --> 00:30:57,812
doing with his
Pinewood Derby car?

619
00:30:57,882 --> 00:30:59,975
Derby?

620
00:31:00,051 --> 00:31:02,451
Oh! Yeah, oh, that,
uh, that... that little,

621
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:03,509
the little Derby, yeah.

622
00:31:03,588 --> 00:31:05,055
Yeah, you know, I've been so...

623
00:31:05,123 --> 00:31:06,055
I've just been swamped at work.

624
00:31:06,124 --> 00:31:08,058
I just landed
a very, uh, a very

625
00:31:08,126 --> 00:31:09,593
prestigious, uh, campaign.

626
00:31:09,661 --> 00:31:11,060
I haven't even asked him.

627
00:31:11,129 --> 00:31:12,061
What about your little guy?

628
00:31:12,130 --> 00:31:14,997
Bless his little heart,
he is trying so hard.

629
00:31:15,066 --> 00:31:17,057
Little stinker won't even
let me help him.

630
00:31:17,135 --> 00:31:18,693
Says he's got to do it
all by himself.

631
00:31:18,770 --> 00:31:19,828
And I said, "Okay."

632
00:31:19,904 --> 00:31:21,201
Yeah, well, that's, uh,

633
00:31:21,272 --> 00:31:22,899
that's the way
it's supposed to be.

634
00:31:22,974 --> 00:31:26,603
Man, it's so fun watching these
kids grow up, isn't it?

635
00:31:26,678 --> 00:31:27,940
Yeah, oh, it's...
yeah, it is, it's a ball.

636
00:31:28,012 --> 00:31:29,479
Hey, Phil, I gotta run.

637
00:31:29,547 --> 00:31:30,946
Good luck with
that campaign, okay?

638
00:31:31,015 --> 00:31:32,778
On the camp...

639
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:34,579
Oh, the... the, yeah,
the thing, that's, uh, yeah.

640
00:31:34,652 --> 00:31:35,619
Well, thank you very much.

641
00:31:35,687 --> 00:31:38,281
And you guys have a good time
on those, um, tractors, there.

642
00:31:38,356 --> 00:31:40,483
Okay... yeah.

643
00:31:46,764 --> 00:31:48,163
Hi, Dad!

644
00:31:48,232 --> 00:31:49,790
Hey, buddy!

645
00:31:52,437 --> 00:31:55,964
Oh, wow!
That looks fun.

646
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:57,871
This is anything but fun.

647
00:31:57,942 --> 00:31:59,910
But if it helps you win
the Derby, Danny,

648
00:31:59,978 --> 00:32:01,912
it's all my pleasure.

649
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:03,777
What are "big dogs" for, right?

650
00:32:03,848 --> 00:32:04,906
Right!

651
00:32:04,983 --> 00:32:07,816
So, uh, can I...
can I help, Dad?

652
00:32:07,885 --> 00:32:09,045
Um...

653
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,315
don't you and your buddies
have something going on?

654
00:32:11,389 --> 00:32:13,084
Yeah...

655
00:32:13,157 --> 00:32:14,852
They want me to go to lunch

656
00:32:14,926 --> 00:32:19,795
with them and maybe the city pool
and even the water slides.

657
00:32:19,864 --> 00:32:22,230
But I'd rather stay here
and help you.

658
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:24,666
You know what?
You're going to have to wait.

659
00:32:24,736 --> 00:32:28,263
I'm out of cash,
and I don't have time to go to the bank.

660
00:32:28,339 --> 00:32:30,773
How about
you give me your ATM card and...

661
00:32:30,842 --> 00:32:31,774
My ATM card.

662
00:32:31,843 --> 00:32:34,403
Yeah, right

663
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:36,777
I'm just kiddin', Dad.

664
00:32:36,848 --> 00:32:40,875
Can I, can I help, Dad, please?

665
00:32:44,188 --> 00:32:46,418
Okay.

666
00:32:48,026 --> 00:32:51,052
My ATM card is in my wallet
on my dresser.

667
00:32:51,129 --> 00:32:52,960
The PIN number is 40...

668
00:32:53,031 --> 00:32:53,963
40.

669
00:32:54,032 --> 00:32:54,964
24...

670
00:32:55,033 --> 00:32:55,965
24.

671
00:32:56,034 --> 00:32:56,966
38.

672
00:32:57,035 --> 00:32:57,797
38.

673
00:32:57,869 --> 00:32:58,426
Got it?

674
00:32:58,503 --> 00:33:00,835
Got it.
Thanks, Dad!

675
00:33:00,905 --> 00:33:03,169
You got it.

676
00:33:06,911 --> 00:33:08,503
The doctor will be right with you.

677
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,381
Just another moment.

678
00:33:16,854 --> 00:33:18,116
The doctor will be right with you.

679
00:33:18,189 --> 00:33:21,022
Need more water.

680
00:33:21,092 --> 00:33:22,491
Give me that number two.

681
00:33:31,069 --> 00:33:33,264
More water.

682
00:33:33,337 --> 00:33:34,599
Suction.

683
00:33:34,672 --> 00:33:38,631
Is this your first one, Doctor?

684
00:33:38,709 --> 00:33:40,904
Right, I've never done this before.

685
00:33:40,978 --> 00:33:42,002
And the manual is unclear

686
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,571
on how to do most of this stuff.

687
00:33:44,649 --> 00:33:46,583
Oh, shoot!

688
00:33:46,651 --> 00:33:47,691
I took off too much there.

689
00:33:47,718 --> 00:33:49,686
Water.

690
00:33:49,754 --> 00:33:52,245
Well, let's don't drown it, please.

691
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,789
All right.

692
00:33:57,862 --> 00:34:01,025
Girls, if you're not
gonna take this seriously,

693
00:34:01,099 --> 00:34:02,589
I'll get Maxine in here.

694
00:34:03,734 --> 00:34:04,666
Okay.

695
00:34:04,735 --> 00:34:06,293
That's enough, you guys.

696
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:07,496
You're excused.

697
00:34:07,572 --> 00:34:09,096
Thank you.

698
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:22,311
Hi, Dad!

699
00:34:22,386 --> 00:34:26,152
Are we at the fun stuff yet?

700
00:34:26,224 --> 00:34:29,887
Thanks, Dad!

701
00:34:31,329 --> 00:34:33,092
Uhh...

702
00:34:33,164 --> 00:34:35,064
Coming, coming!

703
00:34:36,701 --> 00:34:37,759
Hello.

704
00:34:37,835 --> 00:34:39,928
Kim? It's Larry.

705
00:34:40,004 --> 00:34:41,062
Where is Phil?

706
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:43,130
I have been trying
to call there all day.

707
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:44,936
Have you tried him on his cell?

708
00:34:45,009 --> 00:34:46,670
He's got it turned off!

709
00:34:46,744 --> 00:34:48,609
He didn't come in today?

710
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:49,668
No!

711
00:34:49,747 --> 00:34:51,578
He was supposed
to be here at 9:00.

712
00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:53,810
And, tell you the truth,
I'm getting a little nervous,

713
00:34:53,885 --> 00:34:56,353
because I've turned over
the biggest deal of my life

714
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,409
to Phil!

715
00:34:57,488 --> 00:34:59,115
The Yakimoto campaign.

716
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:00,748
He's told you about it?

717
00:35:00,825 --> 00:35:01,883
Yeah, of course.

718
00:35:01,959 --> 00:35:05,554
Oh, hi, Mom.

719
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,063
Well, you know Phil.

720
00:35:07,131 --> 00:35:09,258
Once he's onto something,
that's all he thinks about.

721
00:35:09,333 --> 00:35:11,494
For Phil's sake,
I hope you're right.

722
00:35:11,569 --> 00:35:14,169
Really, Larry, you know you have
nothing to worry about with Phil.

723
00:35:17,675 --> 00:35:19,973
Kim?

724
00:35:20,044 --> 00:35:21,636
Kim.

725
00:35:21,712 --> 00:35:22,644
Kim!

726
00:35:24,282 --> 00:35:25,715
Larry?

727
00:35:25,783 --> 00:35:28,650
Yeah, I'm gonna have Phil call
ya as soon as he gets back.

728
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:30,016
Okay, then.

729
00:35:41,566 --> 00:35:42,533
Phil!

730
00:35:45,102 --> 00:35:47,366
Your dad gave you
his ATM card too?

731
00:35:47,438 --> 00:35:49,565
Yeah.
He was all out of cash.

732
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:51,301
So, uh...
how much you taking?

733
00:35:51,375 --> 00:35:53,639
Mm... I don't know.

734
00:35:53,711 --> 00:35:54,837
You guys...

735
00:35:54,912 --> 00:35:56,812
I don't know if this
is such a good idea.

736
00:35:56,881 --> 00:35:57,973
Hey, look...

737
00:35:58,049 --> 00:35:59,676
Our dads are robbing us

738
00:35:59,750 --> 00:36:01,718
of our very first
Pinewood Derby.

739
00:36:01,786 --> 00:36:02,844
What's that worth?

740
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,046
A lot!

741
00:36:04,121 --> 00:36:05,088
Yeah!

742
00:36:08,993 --> 00:36:10,551
Holy cow!

743
00:36:10,628 --> 00:36:12,596
Sweet.
Oh, yeah.

744
00:36:12,663 --> 00:36:15,257
Let's go.

745
00:36:19,971 --> 00:36:20,903
Ow!

746
00:36:20,972 --> 00:36:21,904
Oh!

747
00:36:21,973 --> 00:36:22,905
Oh!

748
00:36:22,974 --> 00:36:23,906
What was that?

749
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:25,943
Uh, sorry.

750
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:27,978
Sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sweetheart.

751
00:36:28,045 --> 00:36:30,536
It's a... a car.
A car derailed.

752
00:36:30,615 --> 00:36:31,775
What?

753
00:36:31,849 --> 00:36:33,680
Uh, the... the car,
it jumped the track.

754
00:36:33,751 --> 00:36:34,683
It... it derailed.

755
00:36:35,953 --> 00:36:37,352
But don't worry.
It can be fixed.

756
00:36:37,421 --> 00:36:38,353
It'll just...

757
00:36:38,422 --> 00:36:40,322
take me a second.

758
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,957
Phil, you're getting
sawdust on me.

759
00:36:45,029 --> 00:36:46,223
Oh.

760
00:36:46,297 --> 00:36:47,418
Oh, here, here, here sweetie.

761
00:36:47,431 --> 00:36:49,092
Here, take... take that.

762
00:36:49,166 --> 00:36:50,690
Put, put that on your,
on your...

763
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:54,096
Take your time.

764
00:36:58,342 --> 00:36:59,809
Look, Robbie, you tell.

765
00:36:59,877 --> 00:37:02,368
He has gone way beyond
the fun stuff now!

766
00:37:02,446 --> 00:37:04,175
I gotta go.

767
00:37:04,248 --> 00:37:07,877
Mr. Savage, you have
someone here to see you.

768
00:37:07,952 --> 00:37:09,214
I didn't think I had
any appointments this morning.

769
00:37:09,287 --> 00:37:11,755
You do now.

770
00:37:21,766 --> 00:37:25,133
Oh, jeez.

771
00:37:30,675 --> 00:37:32,700
Whoa, hah.

772
00:37:32,777 --> 00:37:34,608
Hi, honey.

773
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:36,943
Hey.

774
00:37:37,014 --> 00:37:39,448
Any idea what today is?

775
00:37:39,517 --> 00:37:41,712
Uh... not really.

776
00:37:41,786 --> 00:37:43,879
June 12th.
Does that ring a bell?

777
00:37:43,954 --> 00:37:44,886
Sweetheart,

778
00:37:44,955 --> 00:37:48,914
the Pinewood Derby is on the 15th.

779
00:37:55,866 --> 00:37:57,333
Oh!

780
00:37:59,403 --> 00:38:00,461
Oh!

781
00:38:01,539 --> 00:38:02,471
Whoa!

782
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:03,700
Hey, hey, hey!

783
00:38:03,774 --> 00:38:04,798
Give me the towel,
give me the towel!

784
00:38:04,875 --> 00:38:06,467
Jeez, jeez!
What happened?

785
00:38:06,544 --> 00:38:08,739
I was just blow-drying my hair!

786
00:38:08,813 --> 00:38:10,246
Kim, I told you to blow dry

787
00:38:10,314 --> 00:38:11,906
your hair
in the other bathroom!

788
00:38:11,982 --> 00:38:13,745
You could have
set the track on fire!

789
00:38:13,818 --> 00:38:16,013
I mean, look at this mess!

790
00:38:16,087 --> 00:38:17,452
Yes!
Look at this mess!

791
00:38:17,521 --> 00:38:19,250
And don't you dare try
to blame that on me!

792
00:38:19,323 --> 00:38:20,483
It's your fault.

793
00:38:20,558 --> 00:38:23,789
You have enough wattage
in here to light up Las Vegas.

794
00:38:23,861 --> 00:38:24,987
I'm outta here.

795
00:38:25,062 --> 00:38:26,982
W-w-w-wait, what do you mean
you're "outta here"?

796
00:38:26,997 --> 00:38:27,986
Where are you going?

797
00:38:29,567 --> 00:38:31,501
I'm going to my parents' house.

798
00:38:31,569 --> 00:38:33,901
I'm gonna blow dry my hair.

799
00:38:33,971 --> 00:38:36,496
I'm gonna get some sleep.

800
00:38:36,574 --> 00:38:38,269
And I'm gonna have
someone to talk to.

801
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:43,046
Mom, Dad, you just wait till
you see what Danny got!

802
00:38:43,114 --> 00:38:45,082
It's so cool.

803
00:38:45,149 --> 00:38:47,242
Brady, I want you
to go pack a suitcase!

804
00:38:47,318 --> 00:38:47,943
Oh...

805
00:38:48,018 --> 00:38:48,541
Why?

806
00:38:48,619 --> 00:38:50,860
Because we're going
to your grandparents' for a few days.

807
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:52,756
Do we have to?

808
00:38:52,823 --> 00:38:54,415
Yes, Brady, we have to.

809
00:38:54,492 --> 00:38:56,221
But, Mom I wanna
stay here and help Dad

810
00:38:56,293 --> 00:38:57,253
with the Pinewood Derby.

811
00:38:57,294 --> 00:38:58,352
Brady!

812
00:38:58,429 --> 00:38:59,657
Your dad doesn't want any help

813
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:00,719
with the Pinewood Derby!

814
00:39:00,798 --> 00:39:01,992
That's not true!

815
00:39:02,066 --> 00:39:04,125
I... I'm... I'm doing this
to help Brady

816
00:39:04,201 --> 00:39:06,169
win this thing!

817
00:39:06,237 --> 00:39:07,204
As soon as we get
to the fun stuff,

818
00:39:07,271 --> 00:39:08,238
I'm... I'm gonna need him.

819
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:09,329
See, Mom?

820
00:39:10,875 --> 00:39:12,809
Brady, move!

821
00:39:12,877 --> 00:39:15,107
But, Mom!
Look, you don't understand!

822
00:39:17,882 --> 00:39:20,214
I can't afford to go to grandma's.

823
00:39:20,284 --> 00:39:21,546
Brady, go!

824
00:39:21,619 --> 00:39:23,746
Mom...

825
00:39:23,821 --> 00:39:25,152
if you think for one minute

826
00:39:25,222 --> 00:39:27,918
that I'm doing all of this for me,
then think again!

827
00:39:27,992 --> 00:39:30,290
I am doing this for Brady!

828
00:39:30,361 --> 00:39:31,453
For Brady?!

829
00:39:31,529 --> 00:39:33,121
That's right, for Brady!

830
00:39:33,197 --> 00:39:34,562
I... I don't want him growing up

831
00:39:34,632 --> 00:39:36,759
in the cold shadow
of Ace Montana's kid.

832
00:39:36,834 --> 00:39:39,064
Oh, Phil!
Gimme a break!

833
00:39:39,136 --> 00:39:40,967
This isn't about Brady!
This is all about you!

834
00:39:41,038 --> 00:39:42,005
Mm!

835
00:39:47,411 --> 00:39:48,901
And by the way...

836
00:39:48,979 --> 00:39:50,173
happy anniversary!

837
00:39:53,451 --> 00:39:55,419
Anniversary.

838
00:39:55,486 --> 00:39:56,098
Oh, jeez!

839
00:40:01,425 --> 00:40:02,915
Mother hates rats!

840
00:40:02,993 --> 00:40:04,961
The two of you should get along
just fine!

841
00:40:13,904 --> 00:40:16,065
Hey, Brady.

842
00:40:16,140 --> 00:40:19,303
I'm not gonna need
this anymore.

843
00:40:23,647 --> 00:40:24,841
Wow!

844
00:40:24,915 --> 00:40:26,177
See, I was gonna keep it

845
00:40:26,250 --> 00:40:28,980
and buy a bike like Danny's,
but I couldn't do it.

846
00:40:29,053 --> 00:40:30,247
Why not?

847
00:40:30,321 --> 00:40:32,585
Because Mom says

848
00:40:32,656 --> 00:40:34,248
you're going through
a hard time right now,

849
00:40:34,325 --> 00:40:35,553
and you're gonna need that.

850
00:40:35,626 --> 00:40:37,753
Because you're probably
gonna get axed from your job

851
00:40:37,828 --> 00:40:38,760
and never work again.

852
00:40:38,829 --> 00:40:42,788
Brady, come now!

853
00:40:42,867 --> 00:40:44,061
Look, I gotta go, okay?

854
00:40:44,134 --> 00:40:45,829
You call me when you get
to the fun stuff,

855
00:40:45,903 --> 00:40:47,495
all right, Dad?

856
00:40:47,571 --> 00:40:49,436
Dad!
Okay?

857
00:40:49,507 --> 00:40:51,907
Oh, yeah.
Yes, I will.

858
00:40:51,976 --> 00:40:53,057
All right, I love you, Dad.

859
00:40:53,077 --> 00:40:53,668
Okay, man.

860
00:40:53,744 --> 00:40:55,006
I love you too.

861
00:40:55,079 --> 00:40:56,239
Coming, Mom!

862
00:40:56,313 --> 00:41:00,750
All right, bye.

863
00:41:00,818 --> 00:41:03,912
Yeah... well...

864
00:41:04,989 --> 00:41:07,890
A rat...

865
00:41:12,129 --> 00:41:13,255
Larry!

866
00:41:13,330 --> 00:41:15,127
Kim!

867
00:41:15,199 --> 00:41:17,429
Oh, oh, come in, come in.

868
00:41:17,501 --> 00:41:18,900
These are the, uh,

869
00:41:18,969 --> 00:41:20,061
Yakimotos.

870
00:41:20,137 --> 00:41:21,069
This is, uh,

871
00:41:21,138 --> 00:41:22,730
Uno Yakimoto.

872
00:41:22,806 --> 00:41:25,104
And this is his son,
Kyoshi Yakimoto.

873
00:41:25,175 --> 00:41:26,972
Uh...

874
00:41:27,044 --> 00:41:28,272
nice to meet you.

875
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,580
Uh, I thought they weren't
supposed to be here

876
00:41:31,649 --> 00:41:33,173
till next week.

877
00:41:35,519 --> 00:41:36,611
Yeah, well, it's, um...

878
00:41:36,687 --> 00:41:39,349
kind of a surprise.

879
00:41:39,423 --> 00:41:42,790
Oh, yeah,
Phil's gonna be surprised.

880
00:41:45,529 --> 00:41:48,862
Phil!

881
00:41:51,535 --> 00:41:52,968
Phil!

882
00:41:55,739 --> 00:41:57,036
Phil!

883
00:41:59,243 --> 00:42:00,471
You have company.

884
00:42:00,544 --> 00:42:03,012
My name is Claude...

885
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:05,275
it's Larry.

886
00:42:05,349 --> 00:42:06,748
And the Derbymotos.

887
00:42:06,817 --> 00:42:10,082
Yakimotos.

888
00:42:10,154 --> 00:42:12,850
Now, I'm sorry I can't stay.
I gotta go.

889
00:42:12,923 --> 00:42:15,050
But I want you
to have a wonderful day.

890
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:16,285
Okay?

891
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:18,021
As you can see, Phil has been

892
00:42:18,095 --> 00:42:23,397
working on the campaign,
day and night.

893
00:42:23,467 --> 00:42:25,059
Have fun.

894
00:42:26,804 --> 00:42:27,862
Bye!

895
00:42:27,938 --> 00:42:29,235
See ya later, sweetheart!

896
00:42:29,306 --> 00:42:30,796
Have a good day!

897
00:42:30,874 --> 00:42:32,466
She's...

898
00:42:32,543 --> 00:42:38,379
Put it down right there.

899
00:42:38,449 --> 00:42:39,643
Hi.

900
00:42:39,717 --> 00:42:42,277
Hello.
Let me just get down.

901
00:42:42,353 --> 00:42:44,719
Hi!

902
00:42:44,788 --> 00:42:47,279
Oh boy, it's...

903
00:42:47,358 --> 00:42:49,121
Gee, it's great to meet you.

904
00:42:49,193 --> 00:42:51,161
The Yakimotos

905
00:42:51,228 --> 00:42:53,287
are here to hear
about your progress

906
00:42:53,364 --> 00:42:54,763
on their campaign.

907
00:42:54,832 --> 00:42:56,766
Well...

908
00:42:58,736 --> 00:43:00,931
Phil, if I didn't know better,

909
00:43:01,005 --> 00:43:05,465
I would say you were working
on the Pinewood Derby.

910
00:43:08,112 --> 00:43:10,012
But, Mom, I want to stay here
and help Dad

911
00:43:10,080 --> 00:43:11,479
with the Pinewood Derby!

912
00:43:11,548 --> 00:43:13,175
But, I want to help Dad
with the Pinewood Derby!

913
00:43:13,250 --> 00:43:14,182
No!

914
00:43:14,251 --> 00:43:14,808
Mom!

915
00:43:14,885 --> 00:43:15,579
Danny, get in the car!

916
00:43:15,653 --> 00:43:17,587
I wanna help Dad
with the Derby.

917
00:43:17,655 --> 00:43:18,781
Danny, get in the car!

918
00:43:18,856 --> 00:43:20,153
Come on, Phil.

919
00:43:20,224 --> 00:43:21,782
Tell 'em
what you've got in mind.

920
00:43:21,859 --> 00:43:23,690
Let us know your plan.

921
00:43:23,761 --> 00:43:25,695
We'd love to hear your plan, Phil!

922
00:43:27,931 --> 00:43:29,455
Well, I, um...

923
00:43:31,168 --> 00:43:33,227
I've been...
a lot of different ideas.

924
00:43:33,303 --> 00:43:35,567
But, um... well,

925
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:38,472
This...

926
00:43:38,542 --> 00:43:40,442
this little device...

927
00:43:40,511 --> 00:43:42,911
See!
This little device.

928
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,345
No, no, I got it, Lar.

929
00:43:44,415 --> 00:43:47,816
It's, um, this has
revolutionized the world.

930
00:43:47,885 --> 00:43:49,045
Mm-hmm.

931
00:43:49,119 --> 00:43:51,679
It's made us more efficient,
more productive,

932
00:43:51,755 --> 00:43:54,019
more competitive.

933
00:43:54,091 --> 00:43:57,925
And it's made us, uh, more
of all of these things.

934
00:43:57,995 --> 00:43:59,053
Because...

935
00:43:59,129 --> 00:44:02,098
life has become...

936
00:44:02,166 --> 00:44:03,531
Uh...

937
00:44:05,602 --> 00:44:07,695
Rat race.

938
00:44:07,771 --> 00:44:10,365
Life has become

939
00:44:10,441 --> 00:44:11,601
a rat race!

940
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:25,245
This is a little um...

941
00:44:30,728 --> 00:44:32,128
F-follow me, yes.
Yeah, under the...

942
00:44:32,162 --> 00:44:33,243
Yeah, come on, under the...

943
00:44:34,298 --> 00:44:36,493
Yeah, right here.
Just right under here.

944
00:44:36,567 --> 00:44:39,593
And then there's one more.
There you go.

945
00:44:39,670 --> 00:44:42,138
Then right up over here.

946
00:44:44,508 --> 00:44:46,203
Oh...

947
00:44:47,344 --> 00:44:48,572
That musta hurt.

948
00:44:48,645 --> 00:44:50,044
Yes sir, come on.

949
00:44:50,114 --> 00:44:51,308
Larry, come on, buddy.

950
00:44:51,381 --> 00:44:52,939
It's, one more, Lar, just right under here.

951
00:44:53,016 --> 00:44:54,313
Join us.
Oh, watch your head.

952
00:44:55,686 --> 00:44:57,517
This is... I've done
most of the creative,

953
00:44:57,588 --> 00:44:59,647
uh... work...

954
00:44:59,723 --> 00:45:00,815
here, uh, uh...

955
00:45:00,891 --> 00:45:03,883
Mr. Yakimoto, may I see your...
your cell phone

956
00:45:03,961 --> 00:45:06,156
for a moment?

957
00:45:06,230 --> 00:45:09,563
Oh, he... he...
For you, well.

958
00:45:09,633 --> 00:45:11,760
Could you give me a...
a minute here?

959
00:45:15,706 --> 00:45:18,174
Talk amongst yourselves,
I'll just be a second.

960
00:45:18,242 --> 00:45:21,040
Okay, here...

961
00:45:21,111 --> 00:45:22,043
Phil?

962
00:45:22,112 --> 00:45:23,773
Just one second.

963
00:45:23,847 --> 00:45:24,836
You guys baseball fans?

964
00:45:24,915 --> 00:45:26,177
'Cause I... I love the game.

965
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:27,290
It's... it's big over there,

966
00:45:27,351 --> 00:45:29,319
isn't it, where you guys...

967
00:45:29,386 --> 00:45:31,320
So World War ll,
I mean, was that...

968
00:45:31,388 --> 00:45:33,253
that was rough for you guys,
'cause it was tough for us.

969
00:45:33,323 --> 00:45:34,517
I'll tell you...

970
00:45:34,591 --> 00:45:36,152
Chopsticks, for us,
is a song, you know?

971
00:45:36,226 --> 00:45:37,158
Isn't that crazy?

972
00:45:37,227 --> 00:45:38,694
Like, music.

973
00:45:38,762 --> 00:45:39,319
Phil.

974
00:45:39,396 --> 00:45:40,920
Yep, yep.
Just one second.

975
00:45:40,998 --> 00:45:42,625
Technology's a little primitive
here in my workshop,

976
00:45:42,699 --> 00:45:43,961
but you'll like what I come up with.

977
00:45:44,034 --> 00:45:45,797
Now... there.

978
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:47,837
Naturally,

979
00:45:47,905 --> 00:45:49,839
a professional model

980
00:45:49,907 --> 00:45:51,738
will look a little more...

981
00:45:51,809 --> 00:45:54,642
rodent-like.

982
00:45:56,713 --> 00:45:58,578
But the idea

983
00:45:58,649 --> 00:46:00,412
here is that we dress up,

984
00:46:00,484 --> 00:46:02,509
uh, all of the world's top selling

985
00:46:02,586 --> 00:46:04,611
um, you know...

986
00:46:04,688 --> 00:46:07,452
mobile...
phones

987
00:46:07,524 --> 00:46:10,186
uh, to look like rats.

988
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:12,592
See, and... and then we...

989
00:46:12,663 --> 00:46:15,359
we race them in the...

990
00:46:15,432 --> 00:46:17,593
rat race of life,
where, naturally, the...

991
00:46:17,668 --> 00:46:19,499
Yakimoto cell phone

992
00:46:19,570 --> 00:46:21,834
wins every time.

993
00:46:33,250 --> 00:46:34,581
Yes.

994
00:46:37,955 --> 00:46:39,650
Charlotte's gone
for a couple of days.

995
00:46:39,723 --> 00:46:42,521
Mm.
We need to talk.

996
00:46:42,593 --> 00:46:43,719
Sure.

997
00:46:43,794 --> 00:46:46,558
Okay.

998
00:46:46,630 --> 00:46:47,688
We can talk out here.

999
00:46:47,764 --> 00:46:49,994
What are you building in there?

1000
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:54,702
So?

1001
00:46:54,771 --> 00:46:56,136
How are your times?

1002
00:46:59,109 --> 00:47:00,041
Times?

1003
00:47:05,682 --> 00:47:07,081
I win!
I win!

1004
00:47:07,150 --> 00:47:08,276
I win, no, I win.

1005
00:47:10,454 --> 00:47:12,149
First place, first place.

1006
00:47:14,825 --> 00:47:15,814
It's a tie.
It's a tie!

1007
00:47:15,893 --> 00:47:16,825
They both win.

1008
00:47:16,894 --> 00:47:17,553
It's a tie.

1009
00:47:17,628 --> 00:47:18,617
Tie?

1010
00:47:18,695 --> 00:47:20,162
Yeah, they both won.

1011
00:47:20,230 --> 00:47:21,197
There you go.

1012
00:47:24,301 --> 00:47:26,166
Let's do this one more...
one more time.

1013
00:47:26,236 --> 00:47:28,898
One more time, one more time.

1014
00:47:31,174 --> 00:47:32,607
One more time.
'Cause it's a tie.

1015
00:47:32,676 --> 00:47:34,303
But I really won.

1016
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:39,114
Best idea yet.

1017
00:47:39,182 --> 00:47:42,948
Oh, well, thank you.

1018
00:47:48,692 --> 00:47:50,250
" Funky!"

1019
00:47:50,327 --> 00:47:51,453
" Get down!"

1020
00:47:55,532 --> 00:47:57,659
" You don't get around, baby!"

1021
00:48:03,507 --> 00:48:04,496
" Come on!"

1022
00:48:09,413 --> 00:48:11,142
" Just like that!"

1023
00:48:11,214 --> 00:48:12,146
" Get it!"

1024
00:48:14,051 --> 00:48:15,609
Nothing in here.

1025
00:48:15,686 --> 00:48:17,017
How about downstairs?

1026
00:48:17,087 --> 00:48:18,111
Nothing.

1027
00:48:18,188 --> 00:48:19,120
Okay, let's go.

1028
00:48:19,189 --> 00:48:20,178
Come on.

1029
00:48:20,257 --> 00:48:20,897
" I'm the man."

1030
00:48:21,258 --> 00:48:22,452
" I'm the man."

1031
00:48:22,526 --> 00:48:23,926
" I'm the man
with the master plan."

1032
00:48:23,927 --> 00:48:25,019
" Funky!"

1033
00:48:25,095 --> 00:48:27,586
" I'm the man, I'm the man."

1034
00:48:27,664 --> 00:48:30,132
" I'm the man
with the master plan."

1035
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:32,691
" I'm the man, I'm the man."

1036
00:48:32,769 --> 00:48:35,704
" I'm the man
with the master plan."

1037
00:48:38,108 --> 00:48:39,507
" Come on!"

1038
00:48:57,928 --> 00:48:59,088
Hey!

1039
00:48:59,162 --> 00:49:01,027
H-Hey, hi!
Hi, guys.

1040
00:49:01,098 --> 00:49:02,122
What... what...
what's... what's up?

1041
00:49:02,199 --> 00:49:03,666
Nothing much.
How about you?

1042
00:49:03,734 --> 00:49:04,792
Oh, no, you know,
not... not, much.

1043
00:49:04,868 --> 00:49:06,665
You know, just hangin' around.

1044
00:49:06,737 --> 00:49:09,228
Yeah.

1045
00:49:09,306 --> 00:49:11,069
Where's Brady and Kim?

1046
00:49:11,141 --> 00:49:13,473
Wh... oh, yeah, oh, yeah,
they, uh,

1047
00:49:13,543 --> 00:49:15,170
they went out to, uh,
Kim's parents

1048
00:49:15,245 --> 00:49:16,872
for a couple of days.

1049
00:49:16,947 --> 00:49:18,574
What's that smell?

1050
00:49:18,648 --> 00:49:22,175
Uh... what smell?

1051
00:49:22,252 --> 00:49:24,311
Smells like lead soup.

1052
00:49:27,491 --> 00:49:31,120
Lead... that's funny.
I don't smell anything.

1053
00:49:31,194 --> 00:49:32,474
All right, Philip,
you know what?

1054
00:49:32,496 --> 00:49:33,258
Cut to the chase.

1055
00:49:33,330 --> 00:49:34,024
What?

1056
00:49:34,097 --> 00:49:34,756
We know what you're doing here.

1057
00:49:34,831 --> 00:49:35,388
I... I...

1058
00:49:35,465 --> 00:49:36,432
Where are you making
the cars, huh?

1059
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:37,626
Cars?

1060
00:49:37,701 --> 00:49:38,360
Upstairs, huh?

1061
00:49:38,435 --> 00:49:38,833
No.

1062
00:49:38,902 --> 00:49:40,096
Hey, hey, hey!

1063
00:49:40,170 --> 00:49:41,296
Hey, hey!

1064
00:49:41,371 --> 00:49:43,362
Ow!
Ow! Phil!

1065
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:44,372
What, what, what, what?

1066
00:49:44,441 --> 00:49:45,806
Dislocated my knee!

1067
00:49:45,876 --> 00:49:46,808
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

1068
00:49:46,877 --> 00:49:47,901
It's not funny!

1069
00:49:47,978 --> 00:49:49,468
I'm not laughing, I'm sorry...

1070
00:49:49,546 --> 00:49:50,604
Sucker!

1071
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:51,977
You...

1072
00:49:52,049 --> 00:49:53,414
Man!

1073
00:49:55,952 --> 00:49:58,750
Holy...!

1074
00:49:58,822 --> 00:50:00,255
Two tracks!

1075
00:50:00,323 --> 00:50:03,019
Laser timers!

1076
00:50:04,127 --> 00:50:05,287
I read about guys like you.

1077
00:50:05,362 --> 00:50:08,354
What's your best time
back here so far?

1078
00:50:08,432 --> 00:50:10,764
3.25

1079
00:50:13,437 --> 00:50:14,369
That's a good time.

1080
00:50:14,438 --> 00:50:16,303
Yeah.

1081
00:50:16,373 --> 00:50:18,000
A very good time.

1082
00:50:18,075 --> 00:50:20,407
But it ain't gonna beat Ace.

1083
00:50:21,878 --> 00:50:23,812
How do you know that?

1084
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,780
Have you seen his car?

1085
00:50:25,849 --> 00:50:29,216
Yes and no.

1086
00:50:29,286 --> 00:50:32,585
What do you mean by that?

1087
00:50:32,656 --> 00:50:34,487
Where's your Pinewood Derby Bible?

1088
00:50:34,558 --> 00:50:38,085
My Bible?

1089
00:50:38,161 --> 00:50:41,153
Master "Slicer Dicer".

1090
00:50:45,635 --> 00:50:46,659
Oh...

1091
00:50:56,847 --> 00:50:59,213
Okay, here you go.

1092
00:50:59,282 --> 00:51:01,409
Check this out.

1093
00:51:01,485 --> 00:51:03,112
Ace Montana?

1094
00:51:03,186 --> 00:51:03,686
Uh-huh.

1095
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:06,314
We're competing against the guy
that wrote the Bible.

1096
00:51:06,389 --> 00:51:08,550
Now you know
why the guy never works!

1097
00:51:08,625 --> 00:51:10,354
He sold a million of these babies.

1098
00:51:10,427 --> 00:51:11,894
And check this out,

1099
00:51:11,962 --> 00:51:14,829
page 537.

1100
00:51:19,236 --> 00:51:20,294
So, so what?

1101
00:51:20,370 --> 00:51:21,997
So?
So what?

1102
00:51:22,072 --> 00:51:24,063
Ace made this car
when he was eight.

1103
00:51:24,141 --> 00:51:25,836
It still holds the world record

1104
00:51:25,909 --> 00:51:27,035
of 3.11275.

1105
00:51:27,110 --> 00:51:28,372
They took a picture of this car

1106
00:51:28,445 --> 00:51:30,276
in California, before he moved here.

1107
00:51:34,684 --> 00:51:36,481
What...?

1108
00:51:36,553 --> 00:51:38,316
Uh-huh.

1109
00:51:38,388 --> 00:51:41,653
Why... why didn't you
show me this sooner?

1110
00:51:41,725 --> 00:51:43,420
Why didn't you
show me this sooner?

1111
00:51:43,493 --> 00:51:46,087
Why, why?

1112
00:51:46,163 --> 00:51:48,097
I've done all of this.

1113
00:51:48,165 --> 00:51:50,133
This... all of this.

1114
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,599
Look!

1115
00:51:51,668 --> 00:51:53,533
All of this!

1116
00:51:53,603 --> 00:51:54,035
I've done all of this!

1117
00:51:54,104 --> 00:51:54,624
Yeah, I know.

1118
00:51:54,671 --> 00:51:55,603
For what?

1119
00:51:55,672 --> 00:51:56,832
For what?

1120
00:51:56,907 --> 00:51:58,932
I'll tell ya for what!
For nothing!

1121
00:51:59,009 --> 00:52:00,441
- No.
- No, for nothing!

1122
00:52:00,510 --> 00:52:00,942
Phil!

1123
00:52:01,011 --> 00:52:02,308
Ace Montana is a fluke!

1124
00:52:02,379 --> 00:52:02,879
Okay, Phil!

1125
00:52:02,946 --> 00:52:03,466
He's a fluke!

1126
00:52:03,513 --> 00:52:04,775
And you can't beat a fluke!

1127
00:52:04,848 --> 00:52:06,076
All right, Phil.

1128
00:52:06,149 --> 00:52:06,808
He's a fluke.

1129
00:52:06,883 --> 00:52:07,281
It's okay, it's okay.

1130
00:52:07,350 --> 00:52:08,908
Will you help me out here?

1131
00:52:08,985 --> 00:52:10,509
Phil, wait, wait, will you listen?

1132
00:52:10,587 --> 00:52:11,519
Phil!
No, wait!

1133
00:52:11,588 --> 00:52:12,714
He's a fluke!

1134
00:52:12,789 --> 00:52:14,069
Hold on a second!
No, no, no, no!

1135
00:52:14,090 --> 00:52:15,057
No, no, listen to me!

1136
00:52:15,125 --> 00:52:15,557
Let me go!

1137
00:52:15,625 --> 00:52:16,057
Listen to me!

1138
00:52:16,126 --> 00:52:16,421
Let me go!

1139
00:52:16,493 --> 00:52:17,118
Phil!

1140
00:52:17,194 --> 00:52:18,821
We figured a way to beat Ace!

1141
00:52:18,895 --> 00:52:21,090
Let me go!

1142
00:52:21,164 --> 00:52:22,222
What'd you say?

1143
00:52:22,299 --> 00:52:24,767
I said, we figured out
a way to beat Ace.

1144
00:52:24,834 --> 00:52:27,268
Now, listen to me.
That car...

1145
00:52:27,337 --> 00:52:29,965
it's over at Ace's house,
upstairs in his trophy room.

1146
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,098
I've seen it!

1147
00:52:31,174 --> 00:52:31,902
Yes?

1148
00:52:31,975 --> 00:52:33,966
Yeah, okay, listen to me.
Hey, Phil.

1149
00:52:34,044 --> 00:52:34,725
Yeah, yeah, okay.

1150
00:52:34,744 --> 00:52:35,384
Here's the plan.

1151
00:52:35,412 --> 00:52:36,344
Tomorrow morning,

1152
00:52:36,413 --> 00:52:38,574
when Ace, Teri, and A.J. go off

1153
00:52:38,648 --> 00:52:41,208
to bowl, or golf, or play tennis,

1154
00:52:41,284 --> 00:52:42,717
or whatever those shiny,
happy people do,

1155
00:52:42,786 --> 00:52:46,381
we go over to his house,
sneak in, get the car,

1156
00:52:46,456 --> 00:52:48,117
bring it back to your place,

1157
00:52:48,191 --> 00:52:50,455
do a little reverse engineering,
bring the car back,

1158
00:52:52,429 --> 00:52:55,626
and kick some Derby butt, huh?

1159
00:52:55,699 --> 00:52:57,929
What do you say?
Are you in?

1160
00:52:59,536 --> 00:53:00,036
Yeah?

1161
00:53:11,014 --> 00:53:12,174
Put your heart and soul into it.

1162
00:53:12,249 --> 00:53:13,477
You'll love it.

1163
00:53:13,550 --> 00:53:15,245
It's great.
There's nothing like it.

1164
00:53:15,318 --> 00:53:16,478
And just...

1165
00:53:16,553 --> 00:53:19,078
You can win this.
You can win it too.

1166
00:53:19,155 --> 00:53:20,281
Not the year we're in it,

1167
00:53:20,357 --> 00:53:24,259
but you can win it in your year.

1168
00:53:27,931 --> 00:53:29,330
Wake up!
Wake up!

1169
00:53:29,399 --> 00:53:32,197
What?

1170
00:53:41,144 --> 00:53:45,638
I don't think I can go
through with this, guys.

1171
00:53:45,715 --> 00:53:48,479
You're right.
Let's just forget it.

1172
00:53:48,551 --> 00:53:51,076
Phil?

1173
00:54:04,501 --> 00:54:05,695
We've got two hours.

1174
00:54:05,769 --> 00:54:06,428
We've got to move fast!

1175
00:54:06,503 --> 00:54:07,197
Yeah!

1176
00:54:28,992 --> 00:54:29,959
Going in.

1177
00:54:50,347 --> 00:54:51,712
Nice place!

1178
00:54:51,781 --> 00:54:54,272
Yeah, first place
in the home show.

1179
00:54:57,520 --> 00:55:00,182
Hello, you've reached 555-1111.

1180
00:55:00,256 --> 00:55:01,348
Go, go, go, go.

1181
00:55:01,424 --> 00:55:03,824
Just leave a message and we promise
to get right back to you.

1182
00:55:04,661 --> 00:55:06,561
Hi, this is the Pine Valley Mall.

1183
00:55:06,629 --> 00:55:08,688
Congratulations, Ace Montana,

1184
00:55:08,765 --> 00:55:10,460
on winning first place
in our grand prize drawing.

1185
00:55:10,533 --> 00:55:11,864
Make it stop!

1186
00:55:11,935 --> 00:55:13,664
Out of more than 50,000 entries
your name was drawn,

1187
00:55:13,737 --> 00:55:16,706
and you are the winner
of the brand new H2 Hummer.

1188
00:55:16,773 --> 00:55:18,434
When you get the message,
please call me

1189
00:55:18,508 --> 00:55:23,207
at the Pine Valley Mall office
at 565-5555.

1190
00:55:23,279 --> 00:55:26,077
Thank you,
and congratulations again.

1191
00:55:30,653 --> 00:55:33,144
Phil.

1192
00:55:33,223 --> 00:55:35,589
There's your proof.

1193
00:55:35,658 --> 00:55:36,818
What?

1194
00:55:36,893 --> 00:55:38,554
Ace and Teri are fake bakes.

1195
00:55:38,628 --> 00:55:41,597
You go in there and you get
stained like furniture.

1196
00:55:41,664 --> 00:55:44,462
Fine, fine, fine.
Let's go.

1197
00:55:44,534 --> 00:55:46,559
They're fake bakes.
I told you that.

1198
00:56:05,922 --> 00:56:07,480
"Big Dog", we have a visual.

1199
00:56:23,973 --> 00:56:26,908
Stacey Lynn Montana?

1200
00:56:26,976 --> 00:56:30,605
His name is Stacey Lynn?

1201
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:34,582
"Big Dog",  did you know
Ace's name is Stacey Lynn?

1202
00:56:34,651 --> 00:56:35,583
His name

1203
00:56:35,652 --> 00:56:38,086
is Stacey?

1204
00:56:40,156 --> 00:56:41,418
You've got to be kidding me.

1205
00:56:41,491 --> 00:56:43,823
That's a girl's name!

1206
00:56:43,893 --> 00:56:47,329
There is no way we're losing
this race to a Stacey!

1207
00:56:49,032 --> 00:56:51,364
It's so tight!

1208
00:57:00,677 --> 00:57:01,939
Let's go, please.

1209
00:57:02,011 --> 00:57:04,571
Let's get out of here.

1210
00:57:04,647 --> 00:57:07,741
Oh, this blows me away.

1211
00:57:07,817 --> 00:57:12,049
There's about over 100 million
Pinewood Derby cars made and raced.

1212
00:57:12,121 --> 00:57:13,850
And this one...

1213
00:57:13,923 --> 00:57:17,825
right here...
is the fastest of them all.

1214
00:57:17,894 --> 00:57:20,328
Part of American history.

1215
00:57:20,396 --> 00:57:25,026
It's like Charles Lindbergh,
Man O'War, Muhammad Ali,

1216
00:57:25,101 --> 00:57:27,592
Cael Sanderson, Babe Ruth...

1217
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:28,170
Lassie.

1218
00:57:32,375 --> 00:57:34,343
How much does it weigh?

1219
00:57:34,410 --> 00:57:36,708
Exactly five ounces,
same as ours.

1220
00:57:36,779 --> 00:57:38,110
How long is it?

1221
00:57:38,181 --> 00:57:41,981
7 inches, just like it ours.

1222
00:57:42,051 --> 00:57:43,348
I love the brown.

1223
00:57:43,419 --> 00:57:45,785
Yeah, but I'm not seeing
anything special here, fellas.

1224
00:57:45,855 --> 00:57:47,254
Me either.

1225
00:57:47,323 --> 00:57:48,847
Let's see what she'll do.

1226
00:57:48,925 --> 00:57:50,950
Yeah, let's do it.

1227
00:57:57,233 --> 00:58:00,225
Call it the "Tiny Avenger."

1228
00:58:02,539 --> 00:58:05,167
Have you already written
the name on it?

1229
00:58:05,241 --> 00:58:08,472
Eh... no.

1230
00:58:08,545 --> 00:58:09,739
Um...

1231
00:58:09,812 --> 00:58:11,712
Eh, eh...

1232
00:58:11,781 --> 00:58:13,908
"Big Rig."

1233
00:58:15,084 --> 00:58:16,016
Careful, it's...

1234
00:58:16,085 --> 00:58:19,953
Oh... oh, that's, uh,

1235
00:58:20,023 --> 00:58:22,116
well, that...
that's not regulation.

1236
00:58:22,191 --> 00:58:23,631
I still have a little sanding to do.

1237
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:24,627
Just put it up there.

1238
00:58:27,096 --> 00:58:28,461
Blaine, what do you got?

1239
00:58:28,531 --> 00:58:31,022
"Say, Awe."
Ahh.

1240
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:33,398
A-W-E.

1241
00:58:33,469 --> 00:58:36,131
That...

1242
00:58:36,205 --> 00:58:37,137
Yeah.

1243
00:58:37,206 --> 00:58:39,197
Okay.

1244
00:58:39,275 --> 00:58:41,140
Okay Jimmy, you got...

1245
00:58:41,210 --> 00:58:42,404
Careful...

1246
00:58:42,478 --> 00:58:43,809
Easy.

1247
00:58:43,880 --> 00:58:44,972
Easy, easy, easy.

1248
00:58:45,048 --> 00:58:48,313
Okay, okay.

1249
00:58:48,384 --> 00:58:51,649
Wait a second.
Yep.

1250
00:58:51,721 --> 00:58:52,721
You get it back together?

1251
00:58:52,722 --> 00:58:55,748
Yeah, I put it back together
exactly the same way

1252
00:58:55,825 --> 00:58:57,053
we took it apart.

1253
00:58:57,126 --> 00:58:58,126
How did the alignment go?

1254
00:58:58,194 --> 00:59:00,025
Lead is balanced
in the front axel.

1255
00:59:00,096 --> 00:59:01,927
Uh-huh.

1256
00:59:01,998 --> 00:59:03,829
All right, all right.

1257
00:59:03,900 --> 00:59:06,733
That's a beauty.

1258
00:59:06,803 --> 00:59:08,703
Okay.

1259
00:59:08,771 --> 00:59:09,703
Let's do it.

1260
00:59:09,772 --> 00:59:10,932
Okay.

1261
00:59:15,144 --> 00:59:16,577
Wow!

1262
00:59:16,646 --> 00:59:18,614
It is fast!

1263
00:59:18,681 --> 00:59:20,273
One in 100 hundred million.

1264
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:21,783
I'll tell you what it is.
It's a fluke.

1265
00:59:21,851 --> 00:59:22,783
It's a fluke, just like Ace.

1266
00:59:22,852 --> 00:59:24,114
Let's take it apart again.

1267
00:59:24,187 --> 00:59:25,211
No, we... we don't have,
we don't have time.

1268
00:59:25,288 --> 00:59:27,654
You were right, it's... it's the...
it's the lead in the front axel.

1269
00:59:27,724 --> 00:59:28,850
That and the wheels.

1270
00:59:28,925 --> 00:59:30,756
They're smooth
as a baby's bottom.

1271
00:59:30,827 --> 00:59:32,158
We gotta get this back there.

1272
00:59:32,228 --> 00:59:34,253
Do I have time
to go to the bathroom?

1273
00:59:34,330 --> 00:59:35,388
No, let's go.

1274
00:59:38,267 --> 00:59:42,397
Oh, man, this wheel came off.

1275
00:59:42,472 --> 00:59:43,461
I...

1276
00:59:43,539 --> 00:59:44,665
shoot.

1277
00:59:46,743 --> 00:59:48,108
I have to go to the bathroom.

1278
00:59:48,177 --> 00:59:50,611
Well, y-y-you can wait.

1279
00:59:50,680 --> 00:59:53,478
I don't want to go,
I have to go.

1280
00:59:54,917 --> 00:59:56,248
See the difference.

1281
00:59:56,319 --> 00:59:58,913
Well, go, go, go, go, go.

1282
00:59:58,988 --> 01:00:00,853
Come on.

1283
01:00:00,923 --> 01:00:02,220
Come on, baby, come on.

1284
01:00:02,291 --> 01:00:03,986
Yeah... right in there.

1285
01:00:25,715 --> 01:00:27,410
Right... a little...

1286
01:00:32,355 --> 01:00:33,515
This is "Big Dog".

1287
01:00:33,589 --> 01:00:34,749
The enemy has returned!

1288
01:00:34,824 --> 01:00:37,918
Get out of there!
Now, now, now, now.

1289
01:00:37,994 --> 01:00:39,928
Good boy.

1290
01:00:39,996 --> 01:00:41,395
They're going in!

1291
01:00:55,611 --> 01:00:57,772
Come on, Champ.

1292
01:01:00,049 --> 01:01:00,981
Get out of there!

1293
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:02,711
Now, now, now, now!

1294
01:01:16,032 --> 01:01:16,964
They're home.

1295
01:01:17,033 --> 01:01:18,000
What?

1296
01:01:22,905 --> 01:01:24,167
Mom, the toilet's flooding!

1297
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:27,698
It's flooding!
Come here, quick!

1298
01:01:27,777 --> 01:01:28,709
It's flooding!

1299
01:01:28,778 --> 01:01:31,178
The toilet's flooding!

1300
01:01:31,247 --> 01:01:33,613
The toilet's flooding!

1301
01:01:39,255 --> 01:01:41,689
There's water everywhere!

1302
01:01:41,758 --> 01:01:44,124
What's going on?

1303
01:01:46,963 --> 01:01:48,396
Ace, get up here right now!

1304
01:01:48,464 --> 01:01:49,556
Teri, what's going on up there?

1305
01:01:49,632 --> 01:01:51,896
The bathroom!

1306
01:01:51,968 --> 01:01:53,765
Oh! On my marble!

1307
01:02:06,082 --> 01:02:07,572
Turn off the water!

1308
01:02:07,650 --> 01:02:08,776
This is "Big Dog."

1309
01:02:08,851 --> 01:02:09,840
Where are you guys?

1310
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,181
We're trapped in here.

1311
01:02:11,254 --> 01:02:13,347
Let's cool it with the "Big Dog" stuff.

1312
01:02:13,422 --> 01:02:15,117
I'm gonna try to get out a window.

1313
01:02:15,191 --> 01:02:17,250
Where's Phil?

1314
01:02:17,326 --> 01:02:18,759
I don't think
he made it out either.

1315
01:02:18,828 --> 01:02:19,949
Oh, you've gotta be kidding.

1316
01:02:19,996 --> 01:02:21,486
Why would I be kidding?

1317
01:02:31,107 --> 01:02:32,074
Go away! Go away!

1318
01:02:33,309 --> 01:02:34,435
Go, boy!
Go, go, go, go!

1319
01:02:36,546 --> 01:02:37,478
Go, go, go.

1320
01:02:37,547 --> 01:02:39,412
Get... get out of here.

1321
01:02:39,482 --> 01:02:41,541
Stop it, stop it!

1322
01:02:41,617 --> 01:02:42,549
Here, here, here!

1323
01:02:43,619 --> 01:02:45,917
Here.

1324
01:02:45,988 --> 01:02:47,250
Go get it, yeah.

1325
01:02:48,791 --> 01:02:50,053
No, no, no!

1326
01:02:50,126 --> 01:02:51,423
Go away, go away.

1327
01:02:51,494 --> 01:02:52,620
Champ, what are you doing?

1328
01:02:52,695 --> 01:02:54,219
Get out of the closet!

1329
01:02:54,297 --> 01:02:56,561
Get out of the closet.
Go on!

1330
01:03:09,512 --> 01:03:10,843
Where are you?

1331
01:03:10,913 --> 01:03:12,778
I'm on the roof.

1332
01:03:12,849 --> 01:03:14,248
On the roof!

1333
01:03:14,317 --> 01:03:15,249
Get off

1334
01:03:15,318 --> 01:03:16,444
the roof!

1335
01:03:21,490 --> 01:03:25,324
Okay, I think I found a spot
I can get down over here.

1336
01:03:43,746 --> 01:03:45,338
Ace?

1337
01:03:45,414 --> 01:03:48,349
Ace, honey, is that you?

1338
01:03:48,417 --> 01:03:49,884
Uh...

1339
01:03:49,952 --> 01:03:50,884
Will you get me

1340
01:03:50,953 --> 01:03:53,217
a towel, please?

1341
01:04:00,630 --> 01:04:02,757
There should be one right there
on the vanity.

1342
01:04:09,205 --> 01:04:17,205
Ace, are you trying
to be funny?

1343
01:04:35,898 --> 01:04:39,698
Ace, are you gonna get me a towel?

1344
01:04:46,842 --> 01:04:49,003
Teri.

1345
01:04:49,078 --> 01:04:50,010
Teri?

1346
01:04:50,079 --> 01:04:51,569
Did you hear that scream?

1347
01:04:51,647 --> 01:04:53,444
Yeah, yeah... What was that?

1348
01:04:53,516 --> 01:04:54,744
I don't know.

1349
01:04:54,817 --> 01:04:56,614
Do you think maybe
you could get me something

1350
01:04:56,686 --> 01:05:00,019
a little bit bigger
than a washcloth next time?

1351
01:05:00,089 --> 01:05:01,317
What are you talking about?

1352
01:05:12,401 --> 01:05:15,632
Champ?

1353
01:05:20,576 --> 01:05:22,544
Go see A.J.

1354
01:05:22,611 --> 01:05:24,704
Go on.

1355
01:05:34,991 --> 01:05:37,357
Teri?

1356
01:05:37,426 --> 01:05:38,358
Teri?

1357
01:05:38,427 --> 01:05:39,689
What?
What's the matter?

1358
01:05:39,762 --> 01:05:41,059
Nothing's the matter.

1359
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:42,893
I thought you put Champ
in the garage.

1360
01:05:42,965 --> 01:05:46,696
I did.

1361
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:49,394
Somebody's in the house!

1362
01:05:49,472 --> 01:05:51,736
Ace, Ace! No, no, no, no!
He might have a gun.

1363
01:05:51,807 --> 01:05:53,399
Call Big Jimmy.

1364
01:06:16,799 --> 01:06:17,766
Where is he?

1365
01:06:17,833 --> 01:06:19,130
He's in the backyard!

1366
01:06:19,201 --> 01:06:21,863
You stay right here.

1367
01:06:23,305 --> 01:06:26,240
Phil!

1368
01:06:26,308 --> 01:06:28,469
Phil, where are you?

1369
01:06:40,089 --> 01:06:40,384
Did you see him?

1370
01:06:40,456 --> 01:06:41,514
Hey!

1371
01:06:41,590 --> 01:06:43,148
I thought I told you
to stay inside.

1372
01:06:43,225 --> 01:06:44,157
Sorry.

1373
01:06:44,226 --> 01:06:46,217
What'd you find?

1374
01:06:46,295 --> 01:06:49,059
The tracks lead up to the fence,
and they... they disappear.

1375
01:06:49,131 --> 01:06:51,031
This guy was under my bed.

1376
01:06:51,100 --> 01:06:53,295
I pet his head,
he sniffed my hand.

1377
01:06:53,369 --> 01:06:55,462
How weird is that?

1378
01:06:55,538 --> 01:06:57,369
You pet his head?

1379
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,635
I thought he was the dog.

1380
01:07:17,093 --> 01:07:19,687
" The way it moves"

1381
01:07:19,762 --> 01:07:22,663
" it's '40s style."

1382
01:07:22,731 --> 01:07:26,326
" Don't you know
that it's driving me wild."

1383
01:07:26,402 --> 01:07:29,735
" Whoa yeah."

1384
01:07:29,805 --> 01:07:32,501
" Won't settle for second place."

1385
01:07:32,575 --> 01:07:35,567
" I gotta win this race."

1386
01:07:35,644 --> 01:07:38,010
" All I see is the finish line."

1387
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:40,207
" And nothin' can deter me."

1388
01:07:40,282 --> 01:07:43,080
" You best believe."

1389
01:07:43,152 --> 01:07:44,813
" Well, it's gonna get
down and derby!"

1390
01:07:44,887 --> 01:07:45,979
it's not like the truck
that you made.

1391
01:07:46,055 --> 01:07:48,387
It can't be, you know,
50 feet long.

1392
01:07:48,457 --> 01:07:50,577
If you read your Bible,
it only has to be straight As.

1393
01:07:51,861 --> 01:07:54,159
They gotta be a certain
distance apart.

1394
01:07:54,230 --> 01:07:56,790
You ever see
the Tour de France?

1395
01:08:02,071 --> 01:08:05,563
" Oh yeah."

1396
01:08:05,641 --> 01:08:08,439
" I'm finally gonna get a taste."

1397
01:08:08,511 --> 01:08:11,537
" Of first place."

1398
01:08:11,614 --> 01:08:13,639
" All I see is the finish line."

1399
01:08:13,716 --> 01:08:15,445
" And nothing can deter me."

1400
01:08:15,518 --> 01:08:18,612
" You best believe."

1401
01:08:18,687 --> 01:08:23,556
" Well, it's gonna get
down and derby."

1402
01:08:23,626 --> 01:08:28,359
" Down and derby... "

1403
01:08:28,430 --> 01:08:32,696
Right, but the thin wheels
are the racing wheels in a bike race.

1404
01:08:32,768 --> 01:08:34,827
The thin wheels are the racing
wheels in a bike...

1405
01:08:34,904 --> 01:08:35,495
What are you talking about?

1406
01:08:35,571 --> 01:08:37,129
Yeah, the thinner the wheel,
the faster the wheel.

1407
01:08:37,206 --> 01:08:38,173
He's got a point.

1408
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,435
That's how Ricky Ricardo started.

1409
01:08:43,412 --> 01:08:46,677
Then you spray it, nice...

1410
01:08:46,749 --> 01:08:49,309
" All I see is the finish line."

1411
01:08:49,385 --> 01:08:51,319
" And nothing can deter me."

1412
01:08:51,387 --> 01:08:53,048
" You best believe."

1413
01:08:53,122 --> 01:08:54,453
All right.

1414
01:08:54,523 --> 01:08:57,048
" Well, it's gonna get
down and derby. "

1415
01:08:57,126 --> 01:08:58,354
Let's do it.

1416
01:08:58,427 --> 01:08:59,826
Okay.

1417
01:08:59,895 --> 01:09:04,832
Ready, set, go!

1418
01:09:15,477 --> 01:09:17,741
What, what, what did you get,
Big Jimmy?

1419
01:09:17,813 --> 01:09:19,405
3.10.

1420
01:09:19,481 --> 01:09:20,448
What'd you get?

1421
01:09:20,516 --> 01:09:22,780
3.10.

1422
01:09:22,851 --> 01:09:24,648
Blaine?

1423
01:09:29,491 --> 01:09:31,254
Oh.

1424
01:09:31,327 --> 01:09:32,760
Okay.

1425
01:09:32,828 --> 01:09:34,955
This is huge.

1426
01:09:35,030 --> 01:09:37,658
This is huge.

1427
01:09:39,335 --> 01:09:41,098
Congratulations, guys.

1428
01:09:41,170 --> 01:09:44,628
We just built the fastest car

1429
01:09:44,707 --> 01:09:48,939
in the history
of the Pinewood Derby.

1430
01:09:49,011 --> 01:09:51,445
Yeah!

1431
01:09:51,513 --> 01:09:52,639
All right!

1432
01:09:52,715 --> 01:09:54,410
We did it!

1433
01:09:54,483 --> 01:09:56,644
We did it!

1434
01:09:56,719 --> 01:09:57,811
Wait, wait, wait!
Hold it.

1435
01:09:57,886 --> 01:09:59,410
Maybe we should race it again,
just to be sure?

1436
01:09:59,488 --> 01:10:02,252
No, no, no!
Don't touch it, okay?

1437
01:10:02,324 --> 01:10:05,088
The less we handle it,
the better.

1438
01:10:06,962 --> 01:10:09,863
She's ready to roll.

1439
01:10:09,932 --> 01:10:12,400
He's right.

1440
01:10:12,468 --> 01:10:13,958
Don't breathe.

1441
01:10:50,039 --> 01:10:51,097
Graphite?

1442
01:10:51,173 --> 01:10:51,537
Check.

1443
01:10:51,607 --> 01:10:52,107
Lead tape?

1444
01:10:52,174 --> 01:10:52,674
Check.

1445
01:10:52,708 --> 01:10:53,572
Sand paper?

1446
01:10:53,642 --> 01:10:54,040
Check.

1447
01:10:54,109 --> 01:10:54,871
Screwdriver?

1448
01:10:54,943 --> 01:10:55,910
Check.

1449
01:10:58,981 --> 01:11:01,814
And finally...

1450
01:11:01,884 --> 01:11:03,249
The car.

1451
01:11:03,319 --> 01:11:05,253
Careful, careful.

1452
01:11:05,387 --> 01:11:06,445
Yes.

1453
01:11:06,522 --> 01:11:10,219
Easy, easy, easy, easy does it.

1454
01:11:10,292 --> 01:11:11,987
There you go.

1455
01:11:15,097 --> 01:11:16,689
All right.

1456
01:11:16,765 --> 01:11:17,993
Phil?

1457
01:11:18,067 --> 01:11:18,999
Yeah?

1458
01:11:19,068 --> 01:11:21,002
We've been talking...

1459
01:11:21,070 --> 01:11:24,130
Only one of us can race the car.

1460
01:11:24,206 --> 01:11:27,664
We want it to be you and Brady.

1461
01:11:27,743 --> 01:11:30,610
Wh-what about you guys?

1462
01:11:30,679 --> 01:11:34,308
If anybody is going to have
the pleasure of beating Ace,

1463
01:11:34,383 --> 01:11:37,216
it should be you.

1464
01:11:39,555 --> 01:11:43,013
Um...

1465
01:11:45,561 --> 01:11:47,153
I...

1466
01:11:52,401 --> 01:11:55,165
I love you guys.

1467
01:12:04,546 --> 01:12:07,037
This is nice.

1468
01:12:09,618 --> 01:12:11,108
Let's go.

1469
01:12:11,186 --> 01:12:14,019
Yeah.

1470
01:12:14,089 --> 01:12:18,890
Oh... um... go.

1471
01:12:29,805 --> 01:12:33,741
Seating is limited...

1472
01:12:33,809 --> 01:12:36,004
Thank you.

1473
01:12:44,052 --> 01:12:48,216
" It's getting down and derby."

1474
01:12:48,290 --> 01:12:51,782
" Well, it's getting on
down and derby."

1475
01:12:53,996 --> 01:12:57,397
" Sweet thing, thing, thing,
thing, thing, thing."

1476
01:13:00,135 --> 01:13:01,830
The rules state
that you cannot touch your car

1477
01:13:01,904 --> 01:13:04,805
once it has been registered.

1478
01:13:45,981 --> 01:13:47,141
You coming?

1479
01:13:47,216 --> 01:13:48,774
Yeah, I'll be there
in a minute.

1480
01:13:48,851 --> 01:13:49,283
Yeah.

1481
01:13:49,351 --> 01:13:50,283
Phil.

1482
01:13:50,352 --> 01:13:51,614
Hey.

1483
01:13:51,687 --> 01:13:53,120
Hey.

1484
01:13:53,188 --> 01:13:54,314
Thanks for coming.

1485
01:13:54,389 --> 01:13:56,323
I guess you...
you got my message?

1486
01:13:56,391 --> 01:13:56,948
Yeah.

1487
01:13:57,025 --> 01:13:57,957
Yeah.

1488
01:13:58,026 --> 01:13:59,653
What happened to your leg?

1489
01:13:59,728 --> 01:14:01,569
I'll tell you about
that later, but guess what?

1490
01:14:01,597 --> 01:14:03,121
We got the Yakimoto campaign.

1491
01:14:03,198 --> 01:14:04,165
Huh?

1492
01:14:04,233 --> 01:14:05,131
How did you do that?

1493
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:08,226
You know one of those flashes
I told you about?

1494
01:14:09,338 --> 01:14:11,397
So, um...
where's... where's Brady?

1495
01:14:16,378 --> 01:14:17,572
There he is.

1496
01:14:17,646 --> 01:14:20,410
He has been working...

1497
01:14:20,482 --> 01:14:22,347
for two days on a car.

1498
01:14:22,417 --> 01:14:23,907
What car?

1499
01:14:23,986 --> 01:14:26,147
Dad's neighbor
gave him some pointers.

1500
01:14:26,221 --> 01:14:27,210
Oh, Kim, Kim...

1501
01:14:27,289 --> 01:14:29,154
He's really excited, Phil.

1502
01:14:29,224 --> 01:14:30,191
Okay, okay.

1503
01:14:30,259 --> 01:14:33,854
But Kim, just... just wait.
Just one second.

1504
01:14:33,929 --> 01:14:38,525
Take a look at this.

1505
01:14:39,801 --> 01:14:42,736
It's beautiful, right?
Yeah.

1506
01:14:42,804 --> 01:14:46,069
She does the track in 3.10.

1507
01:14:46,141 --> 01:14:48,132
She's gonna... she's gonna be
number one today.

1508
01:14:48,210 --> 01:14:49,609
Mm-hmm.

1509
01:14:49,678 --> 01:14:51,543
I'm hoping you're gonna be
number one today, Phil.

1510
01:14:51,613 --> 01:14:52,773
What's that supposed to mean?

1511
01:14:52,814 --> 01:14:54,714
Think about it.

1512
01:14:54,783 --> 01:14:58,742
Maybe you'll get
one of those flashes.

1513
01:14:58,820 --> 01:15:00,947
No, no, no...
Kim, Kim, Kim!

1514
01:15:01,023 --> 01:15:02,388
No, don't...

1515
01:15:02,457 --> 01:15:03,890
Kim, don't, don't, don't,
don't make me do this.

1516
01:15:03,959 --> 01:15:07,122
I, I put, like, 100 hours into this car.

1517
01:15:07,195 --> 01:15:09,755
How did it go?

1518
01:15:09,831 --> 01:15:12,493
I think it was
one of your best slogans.

1519
01:15:12,568 --> 01:15:14,866
It was from
the United Care campaign.

1520
01:15:14,937 --> 01:15:17,030
Let's see... oh!

1521
01:15:17,105 --> 01:15:21,098
"Sacrifice is when you give up
something good

1522
01:15:21,176 --> 01:15:23,701
for something better."

1523
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:28,838
I love you, Phil.

1524
01:15:31,887 --> 01:15:37,291
And I am very excited
about the Derbymoto campaign.

1525
01:15:37,359 --> 01:15:39,384
Kim?

1526
01:15:39,461 --> 01:15:41,326
Kim, Kim, Kim, Kim,
Kim, Kim, Kim?

1527
01:15:41,396 --> 01:15:42,522
3.10.

1528
01:15:42,698 --> 01:15:43,892
3.10.

1529
01:15:43,966 --> 01:15:44,364
Kim?

1530
01:15:44,433 --> 01:15:46,333
I put 150 hours into this car!

1531
01:15:46,401 --> 01:15:48,665
Hey, just let me race it, huh?

1532
01:15:48,737 --> 01:15:49,829
Hey, please!

1533
01:15:49,905 --> 01:15:51,338
Ow... oh... ow...

1534
01:15:51,406 --> 01:15:52,668
Come on, let's go!

1535
01:15:52,741 --> 01:15:54,231
What are you waiting for?

1536
01:15:54,309 --> 01:15:55,742
Did, did, did you guys,
did you see that?

1537
01:15:55,811 --> 01:15:56,209
Yeah.

1538
01:15:56,278 --> 01:15:57,609
Disqualified.

1539
01:15:57,679 --> 01:16:02,139
He hired some kid to pose as his son
so he could get into the Derby.

1540
01:16:02,217 --> 01:16:03,411
Yeah, I guess
all he's got is girls.

1541
01:16:03,485 --> 01:16:05,646
Says his dad never let him
make his own car.

1542
01:16:05,721 --> 01:16:08,281
What some people won't do.

1543
01:16:08,357 --> 01:16:09,949
Hey guys!

1544
01:16:10,025 --> 01:16:10,992
How's it going?

1545
01:16:11,059 --> 01:16:12,583
Hey.

1546
01:16:12,661 --> 01:16:13,861
Hey, y'all seen A.J. and Teri?

1547
01:16:13,895 --> 01:16:16,796
Yeah, they're right over there.

1548
01:16:16,865 --> 01:16:17,797
Okay, thanks.

1549
01:16:17,866 --> 01:16:19,629
You take it easy
on us today, okay?

1550
01:16:19,701 --> 01:16:21,066
All right, you take it easy
on us too, huh?

1551
01:16:21,136 --> 01:16:23,070
Stacey, Stacey, Stacey.

1552
01:16:23,138 --> 01:16:25,629
This is the last call for race entry.

1553
01:16:29,077 --> 01:16:32,410
Guys?

1554
01:16:32,481 --> 01:16:33,675
Guys, I'm not gonna...

1555
01:16:33,749 --> 01:16:35,979
I'm not gonna race the car today.

1556
01:16:36,051 --> 01:16:37,018
Which one of you guys wants it?

1557
01:16:37,085 --> 01:16:37,676
What?

1558
01:16:37,753 --> 01:16:38,981
What are you talking about?

1559
01:16:39,054 --> 01:16:41,352
Brady made a car.

1560
01:16:41,423 --> 01:16:42,253
Come on.
Hold on.

1561
01:16:42,324 --> 01:16:44,258
Wait a second.
What about you?

1562
01:16:44,326 --> 01:16:45,691
Does he have any idea

1563
01:16:45,761 --> 01:16:47,820
how much time and effort
you put into this thing?

1564
01:16:47,896 --> 01:16:48,828
Where's Brady?

1565
01:16:48,897 --> 01:16:50,159
No, no, Big, Big Jimmy!

1566
01:16:50,232 --> 01:16:52,427
It's not about that.
This is what I gotta do.

1567
01:16:54,770 --> 01:16:56,237
This is what I want to do.

1568
01:16:56,304 --> 01:16:57,703
Over my dead body

1569
01:16:57,773 --> 01:17:01,732
is Ace gonna win this thing today.

1570
01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:03,334
Give me that car!

1571
01:17:03,412 --> 01:17:04,709
You have three minutes

1572
01:17:04,780 --> 01:17:06,475
to register your car.

1573
01:17:06,548 --> 01:17:08,573
This is the last call.

1574
01:17:11,987 --> 01:17:15,923
Yeah...

1575
01:17:15,991 --> 01:17:17,481
Excuse me.

1576
01:17:17,559 --> 01:17:19,220
Hey, buddy.

1577
01:17:19,294 --> 01:17:20,659
I've been looking
all over for you.

1578
01:17:20,729 --> 01:17:21,661
Me?

1579
01:17:21,730 --> 01:17:22,856
Yeah.

1580
01:17:22,931 --> 01:17:24,292
You know, you better
get down there

1581
01:17:24,332 --> 01:17:25,321
and get your car registered.

1582
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:27,061
You're...
you're gonna be late.

1583
01:17:27,135 --> 01:17:29,865
Well... what about your car?

1584
01:17:29,938 --> 01:17:33,101
Oh, forget about...
my car.

1585
01:17:33,175 --> 01:17:35,234
Your car is what
the Pinewood Derby's all about.

1586
01:17:35,310 --> 01:17:37,938
Now, go on... get your car
and get down there.

1587
01:17:38,013 --> 01:17:39,207
Aw... thanks, Dad!

1588
01:17:39,281 --> 01:17:40,680
All right.
Okay, buddy.

1589
01:17:40,749 --> 01:17:42,512
We have to get started.

1590
01:17:42,584 --> 01:17:47,749
This is absolutely the last call.

1591
01:17:47,823 --> 01:17:50,383
3.10.

1592
01:17:52,761 --> 01:17:54,194
Mwah!

1593
01:18:01,303 --> 01:18:03,237
Ladies and gentlemen.

1594
01:18:03,305 --> 01:18:05,967
Welcome to the annual
Pinewood Derby,

1595
01:18:06,041 --> 01:18:09,602
the greatest race in the world.

1596
01:18:13,815 --> 01:18:17,410
And for this greatest race in the world,

1597
01:18:17,486 --> 01:18:20,284
we have an extremely special guest.

1598
01:18:20,355 --> 01:18:26,385
Back in 1953, this man founded
and created the Pinewood Derby.

1599
01:18:26,461 --> 01:18:28,656
Please welcome...

1600
01:18:28,730 --> 01:18:30,595
Mr. Don Murphy!

1601
01:18:33,435 --> 01:18:35,369
Thank you.

1602
01:18:40,675 --> 01:18:42,643
Are we ready?

1603
01:18:47,949 --> 01:18:52,818
Then let the races begin.

1604
01:19:09,437 --> 01:19:11,530
We have a winner in lane 5.

1605
01:19:17,379 --> 01:19:19,347
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1606
01:19:19,414 --> 01:19:22,474
We have a winner in Lane 2.

1607
01:19:23,952 --> 01:19:27,183
Mom, Dad, my car's gonna race!

1608
01:19:27,255 --> 01:19:29,155
On the bus.

1609
01:19:29,224 --> 01:19:31,124
Dad, my car's racing!

1610
01:19:31,193 --> 01:19:32,285
Oh, which one is it?

1611
01:19:32,360 --> 01:19:35,557
Oh, it's the one
next to the yellow one.

1612
01:19:37,699 --> 01:19:39,667
Yeah.

1613
01:19:39,734 --> 01:19:41,326
It looks like it's gonna be
an early night.

1614
01:19:41,403 --> 01:19:44,497
So, what do you say we take
Brady to dinner and a movie?

1615
01:19:44,573 --> 01:19:44,937
Mm...

1616
01:19:45,006 --> 01:19:46,132
All right.

1617
01:19:46,208 --> 01:19:47,835
Hey, it looks good!

1618
01:19:47,909 --> 01:19:49,230
Yeah, what...
what do you call it?

1619
01:19:49,244 --> 01:19:50,541
Well, Grandpa's neighbor...

1620
01:19:50,612 --> 01:19:53,308
he said we should call it
"The Fluke."

1621
01:19:53,381 --> 01:19:55,508
"The Fluke?"

1622
01:19:55,584 --> 01:19:57,814
Wait, who's grandpa's neighbor?

1623
01:19:57,886 --> 01:19:58,853
We are set!

1624
01:19:58,920 --> 01:20:00,080
Oh... shh...
We're gonna race!

1625
01:20:01,590 --> 01:20:02,716
They're off!

1626
01:20:14,703 --> 01:20:16,170
It looks like we have a car

1627
01:20:16,238 --> 01:20:20,004
that's qualified
for "safest driver" award.

1628
01:20:22,077 --> 01:20:23,510
Hey, hey, hey!

1629
01:20:23,578 --> 01:20:25,170
Hey, I am really proud of you!

1630
01:20:25,247 --> 01:20:28,011
You know, it looked to me like
it was, uh, gaining.

1631
01:20:28,083 --> 01:20:30,313
No, Dad I won!

1632
01:20:30,385 --> 01:20:31,545
"The Fluke" won!

1633
01:20:31,620 --> 01:20:32,552
What are you talking about?

1634
01:20:32,621 --> 01:20:34,282
Brady, you came in last place.

1635
01:20:34,356 --> 01:20:35,550
No, you see the black car?

1636
01:20:35,624 --> 01:20:36,852
That's "the Fluke!"

1637
01:20:36,925 --> 01:20:38,620
I won, Dad!

1638
01:20:38,693 --> 01:20:40,388

Yes!

1640
01:20:41,529 --> 01:20:43,326
Yes!
Oh!

1641
01:20:43,398 --> 01:20:45,525
Maybe a late show?

1642
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,862
Yeah!

1643
01:20:52,641 --> 01:20:54,905
Yeah!

1644
01:21:26,675 --> 01:21:27,607

1662
01:22:42,083 --> 01:22:45,075
That was easy.

1663
01:22:45,153 --> 01:22:48,486
Ace.

1664
01:22:55,864 --> 01:22:57,593
Ladies and gentlemen.

1665
01:22:57,665 --> 01:22:59,929
We are set.

1666
01:23:02,871 --> 01:23:04,463
Okay!

1667
01:23:04,539 --> 01:23:05,471

We'll see you back here next year.

1679
01:25:08,196 --> 01:25:10,460
You're the one, pal!
You did it.

1680
01:25:10,532 --> 01:25:12,727
Hey, nice job, guys.

1681
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,631
Looks like you
were just too good for us.

1682
01:25:14,702 --> 01:25:16,363
Next year maybe you guys

1683
01:25:16,437 --> 01:25:17,961
can give us a few pointers, okay?

1684
01:25:18,039 --> 01:25:19,404
Congratulations.

1685
01:25:24,412 --> 01:25:26,004
Wow.

1686
01:25:26,080 --> 01:25:28,105
I don't think I would've
handled it like that.

1687
01:25:28,183 --> 01:25:30,845
He's a... he's a better man
than I thought he was.

1688
01:25:30,919 --> 01:25:32,648
Yeah.

1689
01:25:35,123 --> 01:25:36,055
Ace!

1690
01:25:36,124 --> 01:25:37,056
That was rigged!

1691
01:25:37,125 --> 01:25:39,525
That's it!
We're moving!

1692
01:25:39,594 --> 01:25:40,794
I'm telling you, they cheated!

1693
01:25:40,862 --> 01:25:42,955
I am not second place
in anything I do!

1694
01:25:43,031 --> 01:25:45,499
Ace, I am not going
to put up with this!

1695
01:25:45,567 --> 01:25:47,933
I am warning you!

1696
01:25:48,002 --> 01:25:52,200
Stacey Lynn Montana,
you are acting like a child!

1697
01:25:52,273 --> 01:25:53,205
Get in the car!

1698
01:25:53,274 --> 01:25:53,569
I am not...

1699
01:25:53,641 --> 01:25:54,767
No, no, no, no!

1700
01:25:54,842 --> 01:25:56,275
Get in the car!

1701
01:25:56,344 --> 01:25:59,973
I've got over 100 hours in that car!

1702
01:26:00,048 --> 01:26:01,515
Yikes.

1703
01:26:03,618 --> 01:26:05,245
Hey, congratulations man.

1704
01:26:05,320 --> 01:26:06,309
Ah... thanks, Dad!

1705
01:26:06,387 --> 01:26:07,376
No, I'm really proud of you!

1706
01:26:07,455 --> 01:26:08,547
But, tell me something,
one question?

1707
01:26:08,623 --> 01:26:10,454
Did you really build that car
all by yourself?

1708
01:26:10,525 --> 01:26:11,958
Oh, yeah.

1709
01:26:12,026 --> 01:26:14,085
Well... Grandpa's neighbor
gave me some pointers,

1710
01:26:14,162 --> 01:26:15,720
but I did it
all on my own, honest.

1711
01:26:15,797 --> 01:26:16,729
I know.

1712
01:26:16,798 --> 01:26:18,288
That's amazing!

1713
01:26:18,366 --> 01:26:20,027
Who's, uh, who's, uh,
who's Grandpa's neighbor?

1714
01:26:20,101 --> 01:26:22,865
Oh, you see the man over there
wearing a plaid shirt?

1715
01:26:22,937 --> 01:26:24,996
That's him.

1716
01:26:25,073 --> 01:26:26,370
Oh.

1717
01:26:26,441 --> 01:26:28,170
Oh.

1718
01:26:35,016 --> 01:26:37,507
" You best believe."

1719
01:26:37,585 --> 01:26:41,487
" Well, its gonna get
down and derby. "
