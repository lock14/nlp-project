The Commodore 64, the lawn dart...



...the Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robots,
Super Sugar Crisp...



...the LaserDisc and now,
back from the halls of obsolescence...



-...the Betamax machine.
-You are a lifesaver.



Less than 48 hours to become
an expert documentarian...



...all my mom's old newsreels
are on Beta.



What? Dawson Leery eschewing
the ephemeral world of make-believe...



...for the gritty realities of real life?



Has the world spun off-course?
Was the Dalai Lama at Black Angus?



More like my mother's
been dangling a big, fat carrot.



Human interest story for the network
fell out at the last minute.



-And?
-And she says...



...if l can get her raw footage by Friday,
there's a chance...



-...it could be on the air that night.
-Hey, the chance of a lifetime.



-That'll make a guy change his vision.
-A temporary change.



When l get my foot in the proverbial
door, it's back to make-believe.



l don't know, Dawson.
You got an amazing opportunity here...



...to change your whole genre.



Real-life stories are more compelling
than anything you could dream up.



Real life is interesting, but never as
dramatic as a well-conceived narrative.



Look at what's happening in your life.
Are you telling me...



...that you could conceive of something
more thrilling, more sexy...



...more far-fetched?



All right, fine.
Who's your guinea pig?



-lt's Jack McPhee.
-l get it.



Gay kid joins losing
high-school football team...



...overcomes adversity,
battles antiquated stereotypes...



...and becomes the star. lf you mess
with that story, you're gilding the lily.



lt's a great story, but you can't just
turn the camera on and let it run.



-Why not?
-And hut!



That's what's happening here.
Seems pretty interesting.



My mom must've taped over her work.



Honey, this is Dawson.
Can you say hi?



-Hi.
-Smile at him.



ls that who l think it is?



This is Joey, Dawson.
Can you say hi?



Hi, Joey.



Once a heartbreaker, always
a heartbreaker, huh, Dawson?



Meet local girls from Snapchat on 
DMhookup.com



Good morning.



Why do you insist on degrading
your team colours like that?



Well, Grams, the fishnets
only come in black...



...and the matching leather whip,
it's on back order.



-Oh, Jennifer.
-Come on, Grams.



The entire notion of cheerleading
is just a sexist attempt...



...to try and objectify
the female body.



-l'm making a statement.
-You're making a mockery.



The mockery has been made.
l am simply pointing it out.



But l don't know how many more
pep rallies and spirit cookies...



...l can actually stomach.



Your school has
an important game coming up.



Right now, they need
your leadership and verve.



Back when l was on the pep squad...



...we relished the opportunity
to show off our team spirit...



...by wearing our uniforms to school.



Grams, l hate to break it to you...



...but you were showing off
a bit more than just team spirit.



Jennifer.



'' Like, oh, my God.
Go, team.''



l thought you'd been possessed
by the school-spirit creatures...



-...from planet Overzealous.
-Not yet.



l am thinking about making a run for it
before the pods hatch.



-What do you say, Scully?
-Cut class with you?



Sounds delectable. l'll pass.



What if l told you that there was
a mission to my madness?



-Are you serious?
-But of course.



The monsieur in the stylish shirt
requests the madam...



...for a very pressing
appointment, yeah?



-What is it?
-Well, that would be the surprise part.



-Just tell me, Pacey.
-Let me think about that. Nope.



Well, fine. You won't tell me,
l'm not going anywhere.



Oh, Little Jo, you're so cute,
but friend to friend, honestly...



...check into some
''feigning disinterest'' classes.



Well, thanks. But trust me, Pacey,
l couldn't care less.



Well, okay. Whether or not
you're actually interested...



...you have about 1 0 seconds
to make up your mind. Starting now.



One. Two.



Three. Four.



Six seconds?



Six? l mean, come on,
have you no pride?



-l thought you'd last at least eight.
-l loathe you.



People are shocked
at how you've taken to the game.



Did you love football as a child?



l've only been playing football
a few weeks.



l think the only subject
l know less about is being gay.



l don't know.



Some things are instinct, maybe.



One thing Jack has learned is the
importance of starting practice on time.



Go stretch out to run your 40.



Taking a tenth off yesterday
doesn't mean you can coast.



-Gotta go, Dawson.
-No problem.



We can take care
of the Coach Leery interview.



-What do you say, Dad?
-Not now, Dawson.



-But, Dad, it's due tomorrow.
-Dawson, you can get an extension.



Me, l've got a game on Saturday
and l need these guys focused...



...on football. Okay?



Pick it up!



He wore it in the BC-Miami game.



Spit it out right after
throwing the Hail Mary.



When the whistle blew, my brother
ran onto the field and grabbed it.



Well, the dude's got
some big molars.



They're crowns, actually.
Check out the number two bicuspids.



Remind you of anyone?



Hey, what's everybody looking at?



Oh, well, apparently, we're looking
at Doug Flutie's old mouthpiece.



A mouthpiece?



That was actually in his mouth?



Well, that's disgusting.



Henry says it's his good-luck charm.



Henry needs his head examined.



What am l gonna do, Jack?
l gotta do something.



Jen Lindley, her voice
is the sweetest music.



Her very name is fire in my loins.



Just a thought, Henry, but next time
you might wanna start by saying hello.



Hey, we missed you this morning
at the spirit table.



Where were you?
We were worried.



l stayed really late
at that pep rally yesterday.



-l have limits.
-ls this a low-iron day?



Yeah, try not to let anyone else see,
because it might hurt the auction.



-Auction?
-The silent auction.



You should be really proud. lt's the
most successful one we've ever had.



Like, half the senior guys
have already put in their bids.



What are you auctioning off?



Well, the winner gets to ride in
on the Minuteman mule...



...at the end of the game.



And receive a kiss
from the head cheerleader.



Oh, no, they don't.



-Now, Jenny--
-Jen. Okay? lt's Jen.



You know, this whole thing
started as a bad joke...



...an excuse to get out of biology...



...but do you see what it's turned into?
l have pranced around at pep rallies...



...without even knowing
what the hell '' pep'' is.



l have listened to prattle about
car washes, dance-a-thons...



...and dog-sitting until l could
puke up my homemade spirit cookies.



-Jenny--
-And despite the itch on my ass...



...from this polyester molest-me skirt,
l've done it all with a smile on my face.



But you know what?
The smile is gone.



There is no way
l'm gonna be sold off...



...like a harem girl
to the highest bidder.



Everyone has a limit,
and l've reached mine. l quit.



-'' ETS''?
-Stop. Drop that folder.



-Back away from the material.
-Yes, sir.



Keep your hands in plain sight.



Are you with
the Educational Testing Service?



-That's confidential.
-l hope nobody at Capeside High...



...has done anything wrong,
broken any rules...



...compromised the integrity
of the exam.



Passing along that information
would constitute a breach of security.



-Of course.
-Know where Principal Green is?



No, sir.
But before you go...



...let me express my regret
and recalcitrance at this incident.



-Recalcitrance?
-l mean, repentance.



Repentance, as in contrition?
Compunction?



You know, contriteness.



Good day, ma'am. Watch yourself.



This isn't a surprise, Pacey.
lt's a death march on a deserted road.



We're almost there.



-Why didn't we just drive?
-Because, Potter, on occasion...



...my father actually likes
to use his car.



So l risk my future
to stand in line at the post office...



...and then traipse five miles through
wilderness carrying a stupid package?



Did you ever think about
how much hormonal energy...



...you waste on these quick quips
and the biting banter?



Your life would be considerably
more productive...



...if you would just take some more....



Oh, what is that?
Some more.... Action!



-lf you took more action.
-Oh, like voluntary manslaughter?



Well, how about, like,
sticking out your thumb?



Oh, yeah? And what else?



Maybe hike up my skirt,
pout my lips...



...strike some sexy pose
for a horndog trucker?



Stick out your thumb,
you sexist toad.



l am not a sexist.
l am a pragmatist, okay?



You ever seen The Sure Thing?



That film elegantly portrays
one of life's simple truths:



A female on the side of the road,
even one with a perpetual scowl...



...can flag down a car
better than a guy.



l'm the only one
with an opposable thumb...



-...so l guess it's up to me to use it.
-And here's your chance.



Hi.



Today's your lucky day, Miss Potter.
Need a ride back to school?



Thanks.



Principal Green.



Thank God you are here. ln preparing
for our botany assignment...



...Josephine and l wandered
significantly farther away...



...from the school than anticipated.
l was beginning to worry...



...that we weren't going to
make it home by nightfall.



That's a good one, Pacey.



Let it never be said that l'm
lacking in the creativity department.



Let's hope you're not lacking
in calamine lotion either.



Now, put down the poison oak
and get your butts in my car.



After you, Josephine.



All right. Dad.



Dad.



l know you're busy.
l need 1 0 minutes of your time.



Can't it just wait till after the game?



l'll have plenty of time after Saturday.



Dad, l gotta FedEx this thing out.



-FedEx?
-Yeah. To Mom at the station.



Station?



-What are you talking about?
-The story l'm doing on Jack.



Your mother wants to do
a story on Jack?



l wanna do a story on Jack.
l am doing the story.



-This is gonna go on television? When?
-Hopefully tomorrow.



-Dad, we talked about this.
-l thought this was a school project.



lt is a project.
Remember last night...



...the blond-haired kid
moving his lips?



-That was me telling you this.
-Dawson, this is the last thing...



-...that l need right now.
-Why is that?



Because football is a head game,
and l can't risk my best player...



...or any player, for that matter, losing
focus. l've worked too damn hard.



Forgive me if my future conflicts
with your precious football team.



Now, don't be so theatrical.



l have a football-loving principal
breathing down my neck.



l am trying to build something here.



What do you think l'm doing,
dabbling in a hobby?



lt's the kind of opportunity
l've waited for all my life.



All 1 6 years of it?



Oh, so the importance of dreams
is measured by age?



There will be plenty of other
opportunities, believe me.



-Are you telling me not to do this?
-l don't have to.



Because l know
you'll make the right choice.



-Hey.
-Hey.



You must be lost. Bimbo Cove is up
the creek, right past Brainless Bay.



Save your ammunition.
Eve and l aren't speaking.



-You mean you guys actually talked?
-Among other things, yes.



l need some advice.



What else are dumped
ex-girlfriends for?



This is about my father.



Your father?
What about him?



He told me not to do the story
on Jack and the football team.



-He did?
-Well, in so many words.



He thinks it might
jeopardize his career...



...his chances against Woodward.



No offence, Dawson, but doesn't
a nationally televised broadcast...



...kind of overshadow
a high-school football rivalry?



You'd have thought. l don't know.
Look at his point of view.



The last couple of years,
his cup hasn't exactly runneth over.



He had to give up his restaurant dream,
his wife stepped out on him...



...with the Capeside equivalent
of Ted Knight...



...and he's not exactly shining
as a substitute teacher.



lf you do the story,
he could lose more than the game.



-He could lose his self-respect.
-Yeah.



What do you think?



Well, l think that the swords
that are the father and son...



...have finally crossed in conflict.
l mean, face it, Dawson...



-...this is the stuff of Greek drama.
-Yeah, but is this tragedy or comedy?



Sometimes we fight our fathers
and they respect us.



And sometimes we fight them...



...and, well, we lose them forever.



You have to decide
how you wanna live your life.



You know,
what you can tolerate and....



And what you're willing to lose.



God, this is so important to me,
but if l do it, it's gonna kill him.



Well...



...l hate to tell you,
but according to Freud...



...that's exactly
what sons are supposed to do.



-l dubbed this for you.
-What's this?



Something l found.
Made me smile.



l guess now you can
call it a thank-you.



-lt must be dried saliva.
-No, it's a zipper mark from the pillow.



Yes, that bright sensation
in your eyes is indeed sunlight.



Rise and shine, dear girl.
These lovely young ladies...



...have an urgent matter to discuss.



l told you that l was finished
with cheerleading...



...and unless one of you is hiding a cup
of black coffee under her pompoms...



-...l suggest you leave.
-No, we respect your decision...



...to resign from the squad.



Madison accepted
the leadership challenge.



But please,
you must reconsider the kiss.



-Someone has bid $500.
-But they've specifically stipulated...



-...the kiss comes from you.
-l don't care if they bid...



...the kingdom of Brunei,
l'm not for sale.



What are we gonna tell
the children at the CCHPC?



The what?



The Capeside County Home
for Parentless Children.



Orphans? That--?
That's what the auction is for?



Orphans?



Miss McPhee.
Been looking for you.



-Principal Green.
-Yes. Listen, a critical problem...



...has been brought to my attention,
and l need to talk to you.



-What sort of problem, sir?
-lt's a disciplinary matter.



-Disciplinary?
-Yes.



l'm unable to discuss it
at length now...



...but come to my office Monday, we'll
go over all of our options in detail.



-Options. Yes, sir.
-Monday morning. Be there.



So since Mr. Witter's attempt
at lying to me was so creative...



...l've come up with a little
creative response in kind.



Coming from a just-minded soul like
yourself, l'm sure your punishment...



-...will be nothing but fair, sir.
-Thanks, Eddie Haskell.



-Where is your school spirit?
-l think l left it cowering in the bushes.



That is a gross misconception. l hurled
myself on the flames of responsibility.



l hope a tick crawled in your ear
and laid eggs.



Enough!



Honestly, l am not sure how
to get through to the two of you...



...but since you have an affinity
for one another...



...here's what l have in mind.



-No way.
-That's not gonna happen.



Oh, l'm glad to see
we're all in agreement here.



Can't believe he caught the thing.
lt was way over his head.



-Hey.
-Hey.



-What's wrong?
-Nothing's wrong.



-Why should anything be wrong?
-Because you're sitting in the stairwell.



Unless you're smoking or making out,
it's a cause for concern.



l'm going to meet Dawson
to check out the footage.



-You went through with it?
-Yeah. lt was cool. Went great.



Maybe today, but anything
could happen tomorrow...



-...to rock your safe little world.
-What?



Jack, maybe you
overlooked something.



Maybe--
Maybe you didn't see every angle.



Maybe you had a terrible
moment of weakness.



Maybe, without even realizing it,
you totally, irreversibly screwed up.



Andie, it's not a big deal.
Why are you so paranoid?



Look, Jack, you could live your entire
life on the straight and narrow...



...driving towards something
you believe in. Then what?



One tiny little mistake,
one little error in judgment...



...next thing, your car's flipped over,
wheels still spinning and the radio on.



-What the hell are you talking about?
-About being publicly shamed.



Exposed for what you really are.
l'm talking about a life being ruined.



Cut short. Nipped in the bud.
About breaking Dad's heart.



-Dad?
-Think about how he's gonna feel, Jack.



His disappointment, his humiliation.
We are his pride and joy, Jack.



Think about how hard
he's worked for us over the years.



Now this, in the open,
for everyone to see.



Calm down.
lt's not like l'm still in the closet.



Dad already knows l'm gay.



l know-- Yeah, l know. l know.



l just want you to be careful, Jack.
Every action has a consequence.



Be sure you think
this thing through.



No one cares what I do off the field.



So you have no problem playing
against someone who's openly gay?



If a kid wears lipstick and rouge...



... we'll infringe on him, lik e we
infringe on anybody. No difference.



Well?



l just lost the first game
of my coaching career.



lf you say so.



Dawson, that just went out
to 3 million people.



Not to mention...



...you interviewed
the opposing coach.



-So?
-So?



So two days ago, nobody knew
how good Jack was or who he is.



Now the whole world knows.



You might as well have gone out
and painted a bull's-eye on his back.



-You never explained that to me, Dad.
-lt's pretty damn obvious!



Not to me, it isn't.



lnstead of celebrating
my first success...



...we're worrying about a game.



Don't make me out to be
the bad guy, Dawson.



Yes, l'm angry,
just like you knew l would be.



This is a team that hasn't put a notch
in the win column in three years.



Are we saying
that l'm wasting my time?



-No, l want you to have perspective.
-l can't discuss this right now.



You have no idea
what you're talking about!



Thanks to you, l don't.
Ever since you took this job...



-...you haven't spoken to me.
-l talk to you.



Not the way you talk to the guys
on your team.



-You know what? They respect me.
-l respect you, Dad.



They're more the kind of son
you wish you'd had.



That is not true.



Dawson, l hum the theme
from Close Encounters in my sleep.



l reach out to you.



When we can't find common ground,
l give you space.



-When l take it, you get pissed off.
-No.



l'm trying to break you out of your
self-centred world long enough...



-...to look out for other people.
-Why do l have to look out for you?



-What are you saying?
-l'm saying l parent you, Dad.



l walk in on you having sex.
l give you advice.



l'm the kid around here.
And sometimes l might even act like it.



Come on, let's hit him!
Hit him!



Go back to tetherball,
you limp-wristed homo.



-This is getting ugly.
-Crackback, damn it! Crackback!



Right guard blocks down.
Litvack takes out the end.



They're keying on Jack.
He's getting killed.



And our running game's DOA.
Walk it off, McPhee!



-Good man! Walk it off!
-Walk it off?



-l am walking it off. You walk it off.
-You all right? Huddle up!



Let's go!



So tell me the truth.
ls this all my fault?



ln a word, yes.



Look on the bright side, Dawson.



At least when this is all over,
you won't be on the 50-yard line...



...puckering your lips for some spoiled
brat with furry teeth and halitosis.



-Just think of it as Method acting.
-lt's out of the question.



-l'll flip you for it.
-Not a chance.



-Forget it.
-Fine. l'll cut to the chase...



...and beg you.
Please, Joey. Please, please.



-Don't make me go out there.
-Pacey. Look...



...l should be at work now
making much-needed money...



...but l'm standing on a football field
fighting over the rear end of a mule.



Fine. Fine.
l was just giving you fair warning.



-What?
-l tend to get carsick in back seats.



Principal Green?



l made a mistake. Well,
a terrible error in judgment, really.



There's no excuse for it,
so l won't waste your time.



But there is an explanation,
one that l can only pray...



...you'll find it in your heart
to understand.



See, there's this guy.
And when l met him, it was like....



Like a shade going up in a dark room,
light suddenly pouring in.



He understood me in a way
that no one ever did or could.



And then, just as suddenly,
the room got dark again.



ln my mind, l mean.



See...



...over the summer,
l was treated at a psychiatric hospital.



l didn't have to stay long,
because l got better.



But when l came back,
l'd lost the guy.



He was my soul mate.



lt was like having an organ,
my heart...



...literally ripped from my body.



And all l could feel was cold
and empty, my future slipping away.



And l had lost the love.



So l was determined not to lose
my life. And that's why...



...l stole the test
and that's why l cheated...



...because l wanted to try to keep it
from all getting away from me.



And l know that
l only made things worse.



So...



...now all l can ask for
is your compassion.



And that ends the first half...



... with the Woodward War Eagles
leading the Capeside Minutemen 21-0.



-Let's go.
-Where are we going?



To even the score.



Come on, guys.
You can't let them get to you.



They're psyching you out.
Taking us out of our game plan.



We're not moving the ball.
We're not firing out on defence!



Suck in that gut and go harder.
A long time ago...



...there was a Chinese
warrior-philosopher.



General Sun Tzu.



Brilliant military strategist
who lived about 2000 years ago.



My dad's been telling me about him
ever since l was a kid.



What's with the bucket?



Turn our weakness into a strength,
like the general said.



We'll start by obscuring the numbers
so the other team can't find Jack.



That might work
for a couple of plays.



-That's why it's only phase one.
-So, what's phase two?



Let's get up there
and hit somebody, now.



-Hit somebody!
-Here we go.



Cross your fingers.



-Break!
-Come on!



Hey, coach, what's this?



Forty-two. Blue Turk, right.
Double slot.



Try and find the homo now!



Set. Hut!



Twenty-four to 21,
with seven seconds left.



The Minutemen have one last chance.



Can you get a step on him, Jack?
What do you think?



l think my mascara's running.



No, just throw me the ball.
l'll catch it.



Consider it done.
All right, cradle out. Drill nine shiver.



Broadside option, flow-and-go.
On two. Ready?



-Break!
-It's fourth and 1 4.



The ball's sitting on the 25-yard line.



-McPhee has it!
-Come on, let's hit him!



Touchdown! Touchdown!



Capeside wins! Capeside wins!



What an incredible comeback!
After a long dry spell...



... Capeside is victorious.



Final score..
Capeside 2 7, War Eagles 24.



Outstanding! Outstanding!



-Mitch!
-Yes, sir.



That was one of the most
irreverent and imaginative...



...game plans l've ever seen.



-Congratulations, coach!
-Thank you. That's great--



One good deed down, one to go.



Jennifer Lindley, once again
a victim of her own big heart.



Don't push it, buddy.



-l need to talk to you.
-Not right now, Andie.



No, sir, it's important. lt cannot wait.
We need to clear this up.



-Okay, what is it?
-Well, l made a mistake.



-A terrible error in judgment, really.
-What kind of mistake?



-There's no excuse for what l've done--
-What are you talking about?



-Didn't you wanna talk to me?
-lt was Monday.



l was gonna discuss it then,
but if you must know...



...l'm forming a student disciplinary
committee, and l want you in charge.



Well, l could do that.
l mean, l would be honoured to do that.



Now, what was this mistake
you were talking about?



l shouldn't have interrupted you.
lt's a mistake to be so impatient.



But l'm working on it, sir.



-Okay. l'll talk to you later.
-Okay.



l'm working on it.



All right! Okay! Okay!



And now, ladies and gentlemen...



...the moment that you've all
been waiting for.



The winner of the silent auction,
who is entitled to one ride...



...on the Minuteman mule
and one heart-stopping kiss...



-...from our head cheerleader.
-Ex-head cheerleader.



And here he is!



-That's a way, rookie!
-Get a horse.



-Way to go, Henry!
-Henry?



How the hell did you get $500?



-Way to go, Henry!
-Mouthpiece.



Mouth--?



Wait a minute. You sold
your good-luck Doug Flutie...



-...memorial mouthpiece to kiss me?
-Come on, Henry!



-You gonna kiss her or what, huh?
-So romantic.



l don't know whether to gag
or be incredibly touched.



-Don't be shy!
-Kiss her!



Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss!



You-- You don't--
You don't have to...



...if you don't want to.



Come here, freshman.



Okay, okay. Everybody, go home.



-Show's over, folks. Go home--
-No, no. Not quite yet.



We have a little
unfinished business yet here.



Ladies and gentlemen,
presenting to you your choice...



...for Capeside's 1 999
homecoming queen...



...Miss Jennifer Lindley!



Oh, this isn't happening.



See? l told you everything
would work out fine.



-You did?
-Yeah. Everything works out...



...for the best, as long
as you keep a positive attitude.



Positive attitude.
Okay, is this before or after...



...l disgraced the family's good name
and forever humiliated our father?



Don't worry about Dad.
He's over it.



He's probably out sailing or golfing.
l wouldn't give it another thought.



Andie, you're making my head spin.



Look, Jack, l am just glad it's over.



l can't tell you how relieved l am.



Hey, so who won the game, anyway?



Somebody was so sweaty,
l couldn't breathe!



Somebody wouldn't
let me take my shirt off.



Well, somebody forgot
to open the air vent!



Well, somebody forgot to mention
there were air vents!



l told you we never should have
listened to those two slackers.



This is it?



This is the surprise?



lsn't she beautiful?



Yeah, in a Titanic post-iceberg
sort of way.



-Where did you get this?
-Friend of my brother's.



Works in the marina.
Rescued her after a hurricane.



The owner didn't want her, so l
convinced him to sell her for $200.



When l finish with this boat,
it will be sheer perfection.



-Look at that.
-Pacey, do you know...



...how much money and time
it'll take you to even get this to float?



Yeah. Not a minute more or less
than as long as it takes me.



You watch, Potter.
Couple of months...



...l'll be sailing this baby
around the world.



Hate to tell you,
Captain Stubing...



...but you can't sail
around the world in a 20-foot boat.



-Sure, l can.
-Where will you put the supplies?



The USS Minnow was no bigger,
and it fit Mr. Howell's money...



...the Professor's tools,
Ginger's clothes--



And where do you think
you're going?



-Permission to come aboard?
-Permission granted.



Thank you.



And now, the purpose
for our little foray into truancy....



-What do you say?
-''True love''?



Yeah. lt's my girl's name.



Kind of high on the schmaltz factor,
huh?



Acutely.



-But sweet.
-Remember...



...l told you l needed your help.



With what?



Well...



...start sanding.



You are so overboard.



The night you were born,
l bawled like a baby.



Did you really?



l didn't know that.



Yeah, l think l cried
for 24 hours straight.



Holding you...



...so small in my arms.



l never knew l could
love anything so much.



So fast.



So utterly.



Part of me was terrified.



Raising a son is more a matter of faith
than most people know.



So's being one.



You're right.



-l think l realized something today.
-What?



That my job as a father
isn't to give you the whole picture...



...because the truth is,
l can't see it myself.



My job is to try and help...



...every now and then,
with a piece of the puzzle.



-You have helped me, Dad.
-l hope so.



But your future, your expectations,
they belong to you.



Don't let anybody stand in the way.



Not even me.



You always push me
to be my own person...



...to think for myself.



l just did what you taught me.



What do you say we go home, pop in
Close Encounters or something?



Actually...



...l was thinking...



...how about a game of catch?



Give me that.



Why don't we leave the football
here on the field, where it belongs.



-Bye, Joey.
-Bye, Dawson.
