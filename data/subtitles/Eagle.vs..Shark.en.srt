What is it?

4
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,303 
Well, l've never felt this way
about anyone before.

5
00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:39,866 
Same. But it feels really natural.

6

00:03:44,121 --> 00:03:46,351 
Keep up the good work, Meaty Girl.

33
00:03:47,785 --> 00:03:50,777 
Hi, l'm Jenny.
Welcome to Meaty Boy. Can l help?

34
00:03:54,786 --> 00:03:57,653 
You guys can't come over here
'cause my till's broken.

35
00:03:57,717 --> 00:04:00,811 
- Can you please go over there?
- That's five dollars.

36
00:04:51,548 --> 00:04:54,813 
Please not me.
Please not me.

37
00:04:54,882 --> 00:04:57,077 
Like l said, it's management.

38
00:04:57,182 --> 00:04:59,173 
They make these decisions.

39
00:05:00,215 --> 00:05:02,740 
Please not me. Please not me.

40
00:05:08,247 --> 00:05:09,271 
Sorry, Lily.

41
00:05:11,382 --> 00:05:12,406 
lt's OK.

42
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:14,813 
OK, guys, let's get back to work.

43
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,074 
Sorry, it's unlucky.

44
00:05:24,612 --> 00:05:27,308 
- You can finish up the week.
- Yeah.

45
00:05:40,411 --> 00:05:45,178 
The shark is often a solitary
animal. It's only social contact...

46
00:05:45,244 --> 00:05:48,702 
No, no. You've eaten already.

47
00:05:50,777 --> 00:05:53,109 
Winston's trying
to eat my fish and chips.

48
00:05:53,177 --> 00:05:55,111 
Cute.

49
00:05:55,177 --> 00:05:58,908 
...from a considerable distance
by the distressed or wounded.

50
00:06:03,243 --> 00:06:05,837 
You are apples

51
00:06:05,943 --> 00:06:09,970 
And I am tangerines

52
00:06:10,076 --> 00:06:15,013 
We're different fruit
From the same tree...

53
00:06:22,175 --> 00:06:23,699 
That sounds really cool.

54
00:06:27,775 --> 00:06:30,642 
- Here.

55
00:06:30,707 --> 00:06:33,107 
l got the idea when Winston
tried to eat my fish.

56
00:06:33,175 --> 00:06:35,609 
Thanks, Damon,
l like it a lot.

57
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:41,709 
l'm really sorry you lost your job.
They don't know what they're missing.

58
00:06:42,675 --> 00:06:45,872 
And if Mum and Dad were alive
they'd say the same thing.

59
00:06:47,141 --> 00:06:48,768 
Thanks, Damon.

60
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:50,775 
Well, it's true.

61
00:06:53,807 --> 00:06:55,138

Can't each cheese.

77
00:08:37,234 --> 00:08:40,670 
Oh, OK, no cheese.

78
00:08:40,734 --> 00:08:42,565

Yeah, she's my best friend.

00:09:16,164 --> 00:09:18,132 
Would you be able to give her this?

88
00:09:18,197 --> 00:09:20,097 
lt's an invitation to my party.

89
00:09:20,731 --> 00:09:22,528

lt's pretty much
the second best outfit here.

122
00:12:30,818 --> 00:12:33,446 
So your favorite animal's a shark?

123
00:12:33,517 --> 00:12:34,779 
- Yup.
- Pretty cool.

124
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:38,650 
l almost came as a shark, but l realized
that an eagle's slightly better.

125
00:12:40,651 --> 00:12:43,017 
- What are you supposed to be?
- Tarantula.

126
00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:47,677

A knockout tournament.

00:12:58,516 --> 00:13:01,679 
You probably won't win.
He's the undefeated champion.

131
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,344 
- You're competing?
- Yup.

132
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:07,715 
- You?
- Oh, no, l'm just a spectator.

00:13:07,781 --> 00:13:09,248

00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:11,277 
What?

135
00:13:12,216 --> 00:13:15,344 
You know, your combat name

00:13:15,414 --> 00:13:18,713 
Jarrod, he's the Eagle Lord
and l'm Blaze.

137
00:13:20,982 --> 00:13:23,883

00:16:59,633 --> 00:17:02,067 
- Thanks.
- Where'd you learn to play like that?

176
00:17:02,133 --> 00:17:04,124 
l don't know.
l guess l just got into it.

177
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,224 
Hmm.

178
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:09,031 
You had some pretty cool moves for
someone who'd never played before.

179
00:17:09,132 --> 00:17:11,692 
Takes more than cool moves
to defeat a champion.

180
00:17:12,299 --> 00:17:14,233 
Don't forget that.

181
00:17:19,832 --> 00:17:20,992 
Ow, ow.

182
00:17:42,297 --> 00:17:44,265 
This is a plane l made.

183
00:17:46,331 --> 00:17:47,525 
Cool.

184
00:17:48,897 --> 00:17:51,263 
Guitar, emery board, fret board.

185
00:17:54,197 --> 00:17:55,186 
Painted eggs.

186
00:17:55,264 --> 00:17:57,323 
Jewelry.

187
00:17:57,397 --> 00:17:58,921 
Watch wallet.

188
00:18:03,363 --> 00:18:04,762 
Wow.

189
00:18:06,496 --> 00:18:08,862 
This is the area
where l make my candles.

190
00:18:11,696 --> 00:18:13,687 
Flame within a flame. Conceptual.

191
00:18:14,629 --> 00:18:15,653 
Giant pencil.

192
00:18:16,462 --> 00:18:17,520 
Ancient coin.

193
00:18:18,329 --> 00:18:20,456 
Probably sell these to the Muslims.

194
00:18:21,128 --> 00:18:23,619 
Sell this one to the Yanks. Make a mint.

195
00:18:23,728 --> 00:18:25,059 
Cool.

196
00:18:25,128 --> 00:18:28,063 
l guess l've gotta keep creating
or l'll just die.

197
00:18:28,928 --> 00:18:30,327 
Wow.

198
00:18:36,795 --> 00:18:39,730 
So who's that Tarantula guy.
ls that your boyfriend?

199
00:18:39,794 --> 00:18:41,989 
Oh, no. He's my brother.

200
00:18:43,661 --> 00:18:47,893 
He's a cartoonist. And he's
very good at accents and impressions.

201
00:18:50,293 --> 00:18:51,954 
My brother's dead.

202
00:18:53,294 --> 00:18:54,852 
Oh, l'm sorry.

203
00:18:57,526 --> 00:18:59,790 
My parents are dead too.

204
00:19:01,592 --> 00:19:02,923 
Yeah, well...

205
00:19:03,859 --> 00:19:05,690 
...my mum's dead as well.

206
00:19:09,392 --> 00:19:10,950 
How did your parents die?

207
00:19:11,024 --> 00:19:13,049 
- Heart attacks.
- Were they too fat?

208
00:19:13,692 --> 00:19:16,752 
Oh, no. My dad died when he was 72,

209
00:19:16,824 --> 00:19:20,260 
and then my mum died
because she really missed him.

210
00:19:22,224 --> 00:19:23,521 
Yeah, well...

211
00:19:25,158 --> 00:19:28,025 
...my mum got kicked
in the head by a cow.

212
00:19:28,756 --> 00:19:30,917 
Can't go near cows now
because of that,

213
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:33,049 
because l think about her too much.

214
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:37,520 
l'm so sorry about your mum.

215
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:41,151 
- And your brother.
- lt's cool.

216
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:42,815 
You're pretty beautiful.

217
00:19:44,523 --> 00:19:49,551 
Same. l mean, you are too...
sort of, more handsome.

218
00:19:51,354 --> 00:19:53,219 
- Do you wanna kiss?
- Yep.

219
00:19:53,288 --> 00:19:55,051 
On the lips, though.

220
00:19:55,121 --> 00:19:56,247 
- Yep.
- OK.

221
00:20:07,388 --> 00:20:09,049 
Wanna have a lie-down on my bed?

222
00:20:09,122 --> 00:20:10,453 
- Yep.
- OK.

223
00:20:23,253 --> 00:20:25,244 
Do you wanna have sex?

224
00:20:25,587 --> 00:20:28,215 
Um, yep.

225
00:20:44,185 --> 00:20:45,311 
Fuck.

226
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:48,418 
Sorry.

227
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:56,447 
Hello?

228
00:21:56,514 --> 00:21:58,414 
Hello, is Eric there please?

229
00:21:58,481 --> 00:21:59,846 
Who's speaking?

230
00:21:59,914 --> 00:22:01,404 
The police.

231
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,504 
Hello?

232
00:22:04,581 --> 00:22:07,709 
You're fuckin' dead,
you fuckin' Samoan fuck.

233
00:22:07,780 --> 00:22:09,008 
Who is this?

234
00:22:09,113 --> 00:22:10,341 
Stop...

235
00:22:59,877 --> 00:23:01,139 
Oh, hi.

236
00:23:01,210 --> 00:23:02,837 
What are you doing here?

237
00:23:03,542 --> 00:23:06,340 
l just had a sandwich
and l was, you know, nearby.

238
00:23:08,343 --> 00:23:10,311 
That was pretty good sex last night.

239
00:23:12,309 --> 00:23:14,971 
OK, well. l'm going back to work.

240
00:23:15,075 --> 00:23:16,337 
OK, bye.

241
00:23:16,442 --> 00:23:17,807 
- See ya.
- See ya.

242
00:23:18,943 --> 00:23:21,377 
Uh, what are you up to tonight?

243
00:23:21,975 --> 00:23:24,569 
- l don't know.
- l might go to a movie. You can come.

244
00:23:24,641 --> 00:23:27,667 
lt's the new Wolverine movie.
lt's got Hugh Jackman in it.

245
00:23:27,741 --> 00:23:30,710 
Apparently, l look like him.
Gets pretty tiresome.

246
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:33,403 
''Hey, Jarrod,
you look like Wolverine.''

247
00:23:33,474 --> 00:23:36,637 
Sometimes l wish l did have knives
that came out of my fists.

248
00:23:37,274 --> 00:23:39,401 
Anyway, it's 7:30 at Cine-saurus Rex.

249
00:23:39,473 --> 00:23:41,634 
- lf you want to come. l don't care.
- Yep.

250
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:43,835 
Do you? OK. OK. See ya.

251
00:23:43,907 --> 00:23:46,740 
- See ya. Jarrod?
- Yeah?

252
00:23:46,807 --> 00:23:48,399 
- Eagle, eh?
- What?

253
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,701 
Your favorite animal? Eagle?

254
00:23:50,806 --> 00:23:53,240 
Yeah, or cobra.

255
00:23:53,308 --> 00:23:55,572 
But, yeah, pretty much eagle rules.

256
00:23:56,672 --> 00:23:58,367 
- OK. See ya.
- See ya.

257
00:25:13,468 --> 00:25:15,265 
- Hey.
- Hi.

258
00:25:15,334 --> 00:25:18,098 
Yeah, so l didn't end up
going to that movie. Did you?

259
00:25:18,167 --> 00:25:19,657 
Yep, oh, no.

260
00:25:20,501 --> 00:25:22,093 
l knew it.

261
00:25:24,235 --> 00:25:26,066 
How did you find out where l live?

262
00:25:26,134 --> 00:25:28,295 
l got my flatmate to ring up your work.

263
00:25:28,367 --> 00:25:30,631 
Tell them it was an emergency.

264
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:33,930 
You probably shouldn't go in there.
They think you're dead.

265
00:25:43,865 --> 00:25:46,561 
Yeah. l had to be alone.

266
00:25:46,631 --> 00:25:48,565 
l got depressed about something.

267
00:25:50,098 --> 00:25:52,089 
l suffer from depression.

268
00:25:54,898 --> 00:25:57,196 
Fifty. Break.

269
00:25:59,164 --> 00:26:01,428 
Yeah, that makes me pretty intense.

270
00:26:01,498 --> 00:26:03,830 
l just do stuff without thinking.

271
00:26:06,696 --> 00:26:07,685 
What's wrong?

272
00:26:07,797 --> 00:26:10,288 
l need to go home. To my hometown.

273
00:26:10,397 --> 00:26:12,365 
- Oh, that sounds cool.
- No.

274
00:26:12,463 --> 00:26:15,955 
lt's not cool. lt's necessary.

275
00:26:16,030 --> 00:26:17,463 
Why?

276
00:26:18,129 --> 00:26:21,997 
Because of my mission.
lt's time to put my training into use.

277
00:26:22,063 --> 00:26:23,826 
What do you have to do?

278
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:26,023 
Kill a man... Probably.

279
00:26:26,762 --> 00:26:31,222 
- Who?
- Eric Elisi. He's Samoan.

280
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:32,991 
Why? What did he do?

281
00:26:33,063 --> 00:26:36,863 
Nearly ruined my life, that's all.
He's my high school nemesis.

282
00:26:36,961 --> 00:26:40,419 
He's been living in Samoa,
but l just heard from my contact

283
00:26:40,529 --> 00:26:42,497 
that he's gonna be home soon.

284
00:26:43,262 --> 00:26:47,358 
When he gets back, guess who's
gonna be forming the welcoming party?

285
00:26:49,261 --> 00:26:51,786 
- You?
- You got it, girl.

286
00:26:51,862 --> 00:26:54,296 
What exactly are you gonna do to him?

287
00:26:54,361 --> 00:26:56,886 
l'm gonna kick his Samoan ass,
that's what.

288
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:58,860 
lt's time to pay the piper.

289
00:26:58,927 --> 00:27:03,591 
He's gonna reap what he sowed,
and it sure ain't corn... or wheat.

290
00:27:03,661 --> 00:27:04,787 
When are you going?

291
00:27:04,861 --> 00:27:07,193 
That's the fucking point. l can't leave!

292
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:15,256 
Sorry. l told you, l just
snap sometimes. lt's my depression.

293
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:16,554 
Sorry.

294
00:27:18,426 --> 00:27:19,620 
Why can't you leave?

295
00:27:19,692 --> 00:27:23,492 
Don't have any wheels. How the hell am l
gonna get there if l got no wheels?

296
00:27:23,559 --> 00:27:24,651 
On a bus?

297
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:28,389 
l'm not gonna take a damn bus.
lt'll take ages.

298
00:27:28,457 --> 00:27:30,322 
l'll get there in, like, two weeks.

299
00:27:30,859 --> 00:27:32,156 
Why don't you hire a car?

300
00:27:32,225 --> 00:27:35,126 
OK. Sure. Have you got,
like, a million dollars for me?

301
00:27:39,057 --> 00:27:41,218 
- What about Damon?
- Who?

302
00:27:41,292 --> 00:27:42,657 
My brother.

303
00:27:42,758 --> 00:27:43,850 
Oh, yeah, sorry.

304
00:27:43,991 --> 00:27:46,152 
He's got a car. He's got a Ford Laser.

305
00:27:46,259 --> 00:27:48,124 
Shall l ask him?

306
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:51,452 
Yeah.

307
00:27:52,524 --> 00:27:55,254 
Damon, would it be all right
if we borrowed your car

308
00:27:55,324 --> 00:27:57,315 
to take Jarrod to his hometown?

309
00:27:58,090 --> 00:27:59,114 
Yes.

310
00:27:59,823 --> 00:28:02,087 
- He said yes.
- l heard.

311
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:05,049 
Thanks, man. You're cool.

312
00:28:59,853 --> 00:29:03,050 
- Horse.
- Damn.

313
00:29:03,121 --> 00:29:06,022 
- l've got 1 4, you've only got eight.
- You're too good.

314
00:29:06,084 --> 00:29:07,381 
How many have you got?

315
00:29:08,819 --> 00:29:09,945 
None.

316
00:29:12,285 --> 00:29:14,344 
- Horse.
- Damn.

317
00:29:15,552 --> 00:29:17,042 
Look, l don't even get it.

318
00:29:17,118 --> 00:29:19,951 
Just whenever you see a horse,
you say ''horse,''

319
00:29:20,018 --> 00:29:23,476 
and whoever, in the end,
has the most horses wins all the horses.

320
00:29:23,552 --> 00:29:26,180 
Well, no. Not so much, really,
just like pretend.

321
00:29:26,284 --> 00:29:28,616 
Yeah, well,
it's not even a real game.

322
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:34,551 
l don't really want to play this game
anymore, Damon. lt's dumb.

323
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:38,279 
Hey, so...
What did the Samoan guy do to you?

324
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,341 
Damon, that might be personal.

325
00:29:40,416 --> 00:29:41,974 
lt's cool.

326
00:29:42,883 --> 00:29:46,580 
Him and some other guys
from school used to gang up on me.

327
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:48,208 
l used to be a bit of a nerd.

328
00:29:50,549 --> 00:29:54,417 
Would've been OK one on one.
Even one on two, me against two of them.

329
00:29:54,483 --> 00:29:59,147 
But l'd usually have to fight,
like, eight of them.

330
00:29:59,249 --> 00:30:00,841 
That's awful.

331
00:30:00,948 --> 00:30:05,282 
Sometimes my brother would help out,
and then we'd kick some serious ass.

332
00:30:06,048 --> 00:30:09,677 
But usually they'd find me when
l was alone, and l'm like, ''Oh, OK,

333
00:30:09,747 --> 00:30:13,547 
now l have to fight eight of you.
Come on then, bring it on.''

334
00:30:13,614 --> 00:30:17,209 
Anyway, l don't really
want to talk about it.

335
00:30:22,847 --> 00:30:23,871 
Jarrod...

336
00:30:25,314 --> 00:30:27,441 
...get out of the car.

337
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,781 
l need your clothes
and your boots and your motorcycle.

338
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,848 
- Know who that is?
- [chuckles] Arnie.

339
00:30:37,947 --> 00:30:41,508 
- lt's Arnie.
- He sounds just like him.

340
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:43,911 
Hey, l bought some apples for you guys.

341
00:30:43,978 --> 00:30:46,811 
Thanks. l'll have one later.

342
00:30:54,912 --> 00:30:56,345 
Oh, yuk.

343
00:30:56,412 --> 00:30:58,471 
This is rotten.

344
00:30:59,946 --> 00:31:02,471 
Thanks very much for
trying to kill me, Damon.

345
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,471 
So are you gonna introduce us?

346
00:31:29,577 --> 00:31:32,876 
- This is Nancy, my sister.
- Hi.

347
00:31:32,943 --> 00:31:35,104 
- This is Doug, her husband.
- Hi.

348
00:31:36,143 --> 00:31:38,373 
This is Dad. He's my Dad.

349
00:31:38,476 --> 00:31:40,774 
- This is my friend, Damon.
- Hello.

350
00:31:40,844 --> 00:31:43,039 
And this is Lily.

351
00:31:43,874 --> 00:31:47,833 
Lily's, like, the best female
Fight Man player l have ever seen.

352
00:31:48,642 --> 00:31:50,610 
- And she's a dancer.
- Cool.

353
00:31:50,676 --> 00:31:52,803 
No, l'm not.

354
00:31:54,707 --> 00:31:56,231 
l thought you said that once.

355
00:31:57,408 --> 00:31:59,569 
l like your jackets and your pants.

356
00:32:00,341 --> 00:32:03,640 
Thanks. This is our own label,
Awesome Apparel.

357
00:32:03,708 --> 00:32:07,144 
- lt didn't really take off.
- Which makes these quite rare.

358
00:32:07,208 --> 00:32:10,336 
- Really?
- You wouldn't find these in any shops.

359
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:14,069 
We've actually got surplus stock
if you guys are keen to buy anything.

360
00:32:14,174 --> 00:32:15,232 
Oh, yeah?

361
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,967 
- Are you keen?
- l am.

362
00:32:17,039 --> 00:32:18,506 
Yeah?

363
00:32:20,674 --> 00:32:22,369 
- Dad.

364
00:32:24,673 --> 00:32:26,504 
l made you this.

365
00:32:37,105 --> 00:32:38,697 
Thanks, Jarrod.

366
00:32:39,372 --> 00:32:41,932 
Where are you guys gonna sleep?
There's no room.

367
00:32:42,037 --> 00:32:44,471 
- What about my room?
- Our stock's in there.

368
00:32:44,538 --> 00:32:46,597 
- Gordon's room?
- Dad's in there.

369
00:32:46,704 --> 00:32:47,898 
Who's in his room?

370
00:32:48,004 --> 00:32:49,198 
Us.

371
00:32:49,271 --> 00:32:50,761 
- Who's in your room?
- Zane.

372
00:32:50,871 --> 00:32:54,102 
- Vinny's in here.
- Where am l supposed to sleep?

373
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:55,831 
Pitch the tent.

374
00:32:55,905 --> 00:32:58,874 
l don't want to sleep
in a damn tent. This is typical.

375
00:32:58,936 --> 00:33:01,837 
- No one ever thinks about me.
- 'Cause you're a loser.

376
00:33:01,904 --> 00:33:03,599 
You're a loser. Bitch.

377
00:33:03,669 --> 00:33:05,637 
- Cock hole.
- Bitch.

378
00:33:05,702 --> 00:33:06,964 
- Cock hole.
- Bitch.

379
00:33:07,037 --> 00:33:08,766 
- Cock hole. Cock hole.
- Bitch.

380
00:33:08,837 --> 00:33:10,964 
Stop calling me cock hole, bitch.

381
00:33:14,302 --> 00:33:15,633 
- Cock hole.

382
00:33:16,736 --> 00:33:19,864 
You're a bitch
and you're gonna die of diabetes.

383
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:23,464 
- Twenty-eight years old.

384
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:25,799 
Treat me like an adult, bitch.

385
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:50,158 
Hey, wow. That's you.

386
00:33:50,268 --> 00:33:53,294 
What? Yes.

387
00:33:54,566 --> 00:33:58,127 
- That's so well done.
- lt's OK. My brother did it.

388
00:34:01,834 --> 00:34:03,165 
What's all that stuff?

389
00:34:03,232 --> 00:34:05,166 
- Stuff.
- More candles?

390
00:34:05,732 --> 00:34:08,098 
Yes. Rejects.
Ones that aren't good enough.

391
00:34:08,833 --> 00:34:13,361 
Hey, wow. lt's a hand.
And it's pointing up.

392
00:34:13,431 --> 00:34:16,867 
Give me that. Who gave you
permission to touch that?

393
00:34:16,931 --> 00:34:18,330 
No one. Sorry.

394
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:22,130 
How'd you like it if l went to your
place, started touching everything?

395
00:34:22,232 --> 00:34:24,723 
Like your books and
your oven, or your computer.

396
00:34:24,831 --> 00:34:28,858 
How about l started messing around on
your computer and changed the settings.

397
00:34:28,965 --> 00:34:30,956 
Changed your bloody desktop picture?

398
00:34:31,832 --> 00:34:33,322 
l said l was sorry.

399
00:34:36,564 --> 00:34:40,330 
This candle was supposed to be for
my Dad, but he thought it was dumb.

400
00:34:40,398 --> 00:34:43,799 
- Well, l think it's cool.
- lt's a reject.

401
00:34:49,963 --> 00:34:51,225 
How did your brother die?

402
00:34:52,164 --> 00:34:53,153 
Sorry.

403
00:34:54,329 --> 00:34:57,457 
He was saving a kid
from a fire at the school.

404
00:34:58,363 --> 00:35:01,594 
- Wow.
- Wow.

405
00:35:06,496 --> 00:35:08,361 
[Damon] l'll be back in a week, right?

406
00:35:09,362 --> 00:35:10,522 
Yep.

407
00:35:11,395 --> 00:35:13,955 
You need anything,
you just give me a call, OK?

408
00:35:14,029 --> 00:35:15,496 
Yeah.

409
00:35:16,395 --> 00:35:19,364 
- Thanks, Damon.
- Oooh.

410
00:35:19,427 --> 00:35:20,621 
Yep.

411
00:35:21,361 --> 00:35:22,692 
Oh, wait.

412
00:35:25,294 --> 00:35:27,489 
- Safety grass.
- Safety grass.

413
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:32,155 
- [Austrian accent] l'll be back.

414
00:35:33,227 --> 00:35:35,787 
- See you later, cock hole.

415
00:35:37,361 --> 00:35:39,226 
See ya. Love ya.

416
00:36:19,891 --> 00:36:20,915 
Done.

417
00:36:27,089 --> 00:36:29,819 
l like your family.
Doug and Nancy are very nice.

418
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:32,484 
They're idiots.
Except for my Dad and me.

419
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,648 
l like them.

420
00:36:35,755 --> 00:36:38,246 
Yeah, well. They're still idiots.

421
00:36:58,088 --> 00:37:01,615 
This is Mason Hutchinson.
He's the best computer hacker l know.

422
00:37:01,688 --> 00:37:02,882 
Gidday, Mason.

423
00:37:02,955 --> 00:37:07,016 
This is Lily McKinnon. She's the best
female Fight Man player l've ever seen.

424
00:37:07,087 --> 00:37:08,679 
Hi.

425
00:37:09,686 --> 00:37:14,089 
Down to business. Any developments?
When's the bastard getting back?

426
00:37:47,051 --> 00:37:49,110 
Not today, but the next day.

427
00:37:51,318 --> 00:37:54,549 
- Tomorrow?
- Yeah.

428
00:37:54,618 --> 00:37:56,347 
Good work.

429
00:37:56,417 --> 00:37:58,476 
How did you find out
this information?

430
00:37:58,550 --> 00:38:01,246 
l asked his mum.
She lives in his house.

431
00:38:01,317 --> 00:38:02,341 
Good.

432
00:38:02,417 --> 00:38:06,615 
l'm glad he'll have someone to wipe his
ass when l turn him into a vegetable.

433
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,844 
You've got pornography
on your computer screen.

434
00:38:24,150 --> 00:38:28,519 
Oh, Baby. Oh, Baby.

435
00:38:28,582 --> 00:38:32,985 
Oh, Baby. Oh, Baby.

436
00:38:36,949 --> 00:38:39,179 
lt's got a virus.

437
00:38:48,281 --> 00:38:49,305 
Lilies.

438
00:38:52,714 --> 00:38:54,113 
Go. Move.

439
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:09,637 
Hi, Dad.

440
00:39:23,478 --> 00:39:26,038 
Hey, Zane. You still playing guitar?

441
00:39:26,145 --> 00:39:27,476 
Yep, yep.

442
00:39:28,577 --> 00:39:30,545 
Me and Zane are in a band.

443
00:39:30,644 --> 00:39:33,477 
- Wow.
- He does the music and l dance.

444
00:39:33,545 --> 00:39:38,073 
Cool. Lily plays guitar. She's really
good. She's good at finger picking.

445
00:39:38,143 --> 00:39:40,134 
- Really?
- No, not really.

446
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:43,976 
- Just, sort of, teaching myself.
- And she's got a degree.

447
00:39:44,044 --> 00:39:45,739 
No l don't.

448
00:39:46,877 --> 00:39:48,435 
What do your parents do?

449
00:39:48,509 --> 00:39:51,069 
- They're dead, unfortunately.
- They're dead.

450
00:39:51,143 --> 00:39:53,441 
Good one, Nancy.
They had heart attacks.

451
00:39:54,109 --> 00:39:55,303 
Sorry, Lily.

452
00:39:55,409 --> 00:39:57,934 
- lt doesn't matter.
- She's an orphan.

453
00:39:58,042 --> 00:39:59,805 
Like Oliver Twist.

454
00:40:05,642 --> 00:40:07,803 
Well, l suppose l should
say a few words.

455
00:40:07,876 --> 00:40:09,002 
Why?

456
00:40:10,674 --> 00:40:13,871 
Now we're all here, l'd just
like to say that l'm really happy

457
00:40:13,941 --> 00:40:16,273 
that we're all together
under the same roof.

458
00:40:16,342 --> 00:40:18,674 
lt's always great to come home.

459
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:20,731 
l'd also like to say
that this Saturday

460
00:40:20,807 --> 00:40:23,469 
l will be having a
scheduled fight with Eric Elisi.

461
00:40:23,541 --> 00:40:26,738 
- The Samoan.
- Oh, yeah. He used to beat you up.

462
00:40:26,808 --> 00:40:28,799 
- Yeah, and me.
- Yeah, and him.

463
00:40:29,573 --> 00:40:31,803 
He was the toughest guy at our school.

464
00:40:31,907 --> 00:40:34,432 
He used to pick on
quite a few people, actually.

465
00:40:34,541 --> 00:40:37,510 
Anyway, you're all invited to attend.

466
00:40:37,574 --> 00:40:39,769 
lt'd be great to see you there.

467
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:41,170 
Thank you.

468
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,708 
Why are you fighting him, Uncle?

469
00:40:44,774 --> 00:40:47,368 
Well, Zane, basically,
l'm gonna restore honor

470
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,567 
to the family name, to your family name.

471
00:40:49,639 --> 00:40:52,039 
My family name is Davis. Eh, Dad?

472
00:40:52,105 --> 00:40:54,699 
Yep. Dangerous Davis, back in the day.

473
00:40:54,773 --> 00:40:58,334 
- Yeah, l'm a Davis too.
- Yeah, well it doesn't matter, does it?

474
00:40:58,406 --> 00:41:01,739 
We're family. That's what matters.

475
00:41:09,471 --> 00:41:11,769 
Why didn't you tell me
you had a little girl?

476
00:41:12,671 --> 00:41:14,104 
l don't know.

477
00:41:15,438 --> 00:41:17,804 
- How often do you see her?
- Not very.

478
00:41:19,072 --> 00:41:21,165 
- How old is she?
- Nine.

479
00:41:22,204 --> 00:41:25,799 
- Were you married?
- No. What is this Crimewatch?

480
00:41:26,537 --> 00:41:31,372 
We met at a party, we had sex, then
a baby came out. End of story. Finito.

481
00:41:34,337 --> 00:41:36,305 
How many boyfriends have you had?

482
00:41:36,403 --> 00:41:39,270 
- Three.
- Who?

483
00:41:39,338 --> 00:41:43,104 
Sam, Sam, another Sam and Raymond.

484
00:41:45,903 --> 00:41:47,962 
How many girlfriends have you had?

485
00:41:49,337 --> 00:41:51,328 
About five.

486
00:41:51,902 --> 00:41:54,336 
Actually eight. l forgot some.

487
00:41:55,236 --> 00:41:58,000 
- Who?
- That's irrelevant.

488
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:17,235 
- Lily.
- Yep.

489
00:42:18,801 --> 00:42:20,996 
You can hold my hand
if you want.

490
00:42:21,067 --> 00:42:24,230 
OK.

491
00:42:41,664 --> 00:42:44,292 
- Good morning.
- Morning.

492
00:42:44,398 --> 00:42:46,389 
- Hi.
- Hey.

493
00:42:47,097 --> 00:42:49,065 
Look at all this stuff.

494
00:42:49,165 --> 00:42:51,326 
How much do you reckon you'd pay...

495
00:42:51,397 --> 00:42:53,957 
...for all this makeup?
A bag, like this?

496
00:42:55,664 --> 00:42:57,655 
Dunno. Maybe a hundred bucks?

497
00:42:59,396 --> 00:43:01,762 
No. All this is only 30 dollars.

498
00:43:02,463 --> 00:43:04,624 
And it's dermatologically sweet as.

499
00:43:04,697 --> 00:43:06,927 
- Yep. But you can have it for 20.
- Cool.

500
00:43:06,997 --> 00:43:08,089 
Five.

501
00:43:08,163 --> 00:43:10,791 
Twenty-five dollars.
Because you're a guest.

502
00:43:13,596 --> 00:43:14,756 
Combination.

503
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:18,287 
Kick, punch, block, spin, double kick.

504
00:43:20,996 --> 00:43:25,729 
Kick, spin, kick,
punch, double kick.

505
00:43:26,028 --> 00:43:27,996 
OK, ball. Block.

506
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,792 
Stick, block. Block.

507
00:43:30,529 --> 00:43:33,555 
Hoop. Through, yes.

508
00:43:35,528 --> 00:43:37,462 
- Hi.
- Hey, Trace.

509
00:43:37,528 --> 00:43:38,790 
Hey, Trace-meister.

510
00:43:38,863 --> 00:43:41,661 
Hey, let's take a break.
Good work, everyone.

511
00:43:42,627 --> 00:43:45,221 
- Who's that?
- That's Tracy.

512
00:43:45,294 --> 00:43:46,989 
Their dead brother's fiance.

513
00:43:47,061 --> 00:43:49,996 
- Hey, this is Lily.

Doesn't matter.
Chicks, they just like flowers.

00:46:08,818 --> 00:46:11,184 
My life's just too complicated.

541

l guess, what l'm saying is
l gotta be alone right now.

542
00:46:16,785 --> 00:46:18,082 
Oh, yeah.

00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:28,044 
- l didn't know this would happen.
- Oh, it doesn't matter.

546
00:46:31,549 --> 00:46:33,779 
And we can still be friends, right?

547
00:46:34,982 --> 00:46:35,971 
Yep.

548
00:46:39,783 --> 00:46:41,250

Uh... yes.

00:48:09,510 --> 00:48:14,538 
Could you tell him that
justice is waiting for him?

567
00:48:14,611 --> 00:48:16,772

568
00:48:16,877 --> 00:48:18,845

There's no buses today.
They only go on Sunday's.

00:48:58,474 --> 00:49:01,034 
That's like three whole days away.

577
00:49:06,173 --> 00:49:09,734

I'm away on a mission for
Her Majesty's Secret Service.

588
00:49:57,969 --> 00:49:59,368 
Fuck it.

589
00:50:16,335 --> 00:50:17,825

Take me home please!

593

l don't want to go up there.

594
00:51:32,697 --> 00:51:35,188 
That's where my Uncle Gordon died.

595
00:51:36,797 --> 00:51:40,233 
- l thought he died in a fire.

596

Ouch.

601
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:43,879 
Have you checked out
our local social scene yet?

602
00:54:43,951 --> 00:54:46,215 
No, not really.

603
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:49,075 
We're going to a party tomorrow night.

604
00:54:49,151 --> 00:54:52,643 
- You can come if you want.
- Thanks, but l'm trying to go home.

605
00:54:52,716 --> 00:54:54,206 
- You sure?
- Yeah.

606
00:55:05,817 --> 00:55:08,012 
Does anybody want to hear a joke?

607
00:55:08,083 --> 00:55:09,744 
Yeah.

00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:22,981 
Gaseous Maximus.

611
00:55:39,748 --> 00:55:42,945 
- What's so funny?
- Oh, Lily just told a funny joke.

612
00:55:43,014 --> 00:55:44,504 
Yeah. Where have you been?

613
00:55:44,581 --> 00:55:48,608 
Just hanging out with Tracy. We've been
pretty much laughing the whole day.

614
00:55:48,681 --> 00:55:51,206 
Like this, but about
ten times more laughing.

615
00:55:51,281 --> 00:55:53,272 
Wow. That's heaps.

616
00:55:54,214 --> 00:55:57,411

Excuse me. Thank you.

00:56:10,112 --> 00:56:14,549 
Gordon. Gordon.
Gordon. Gordon.

619
00:56:28,244 --> 00:56:30,235 
Get out of it.

620
00:56:34,177 --> 00:56:36,338 
Dad, me and Tracy are going out.

621
00:56:38,111 --> 00:56:42,172 
Don't know how it happened,
but it's pretty serious.

622
00:56:49,377 --> 00:56:51,709 
Just thought you should know
the good news.

623
00:57:03,607 --> 00:57:05,632 
- Yeah.

624
00:57:32,807 --> 00:57:36,265 
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. l'm asleep.

625
00:57:37,139 --> 00:57:39,835 
- Why don't you go sleep in the tent?
- l'm all right.

626
00:57:42,374 --> 00:57:44,865 
You go in the tent.
l'll... l'll sleep out here.

627
00:57:44,971 --> 00:57:46,529 
No, you go.

628
00:57:46,638 --> 00:57:49,471 
- You go. You're the lady.
- l can handle it.

629
00:57:49,539 --> 00:57:51,700 
l've got my sleeping bag. l'm good.

630
00:57:55,071 --> 00:57:57,471 
You don't complain
about anything, do you?

631
00:57:57,538 --> 00:58:01,133 
There's some people in the world
who don't even have sleeping bags.

632
00:58:12,638 --> 00:58:14,629 
There's a weird smell down there.

633
00:58:15,438 --> 00:58:16,905 
l don't like it.

634
00:58:16,969 --> 00:58:19,938 
Think it's probably
a dead hedgehog or something.

635
00:58:20,037 --> 00:58:22,005 
Disgusting.

636
00:58:24,071 --> 00:58:27,040 
lf you get cold you can
come sleep in my tent,

637
00:58:27,103 --> 00:58:30,095 
but please don't wake me up.

638
00:58:30,170 --> 00:58:32,001 
The last thing l need.

639
00:58:45,501 --> 00:58:48,629 
You seem to be getting on
pretty well with my family.

640
00:58:48,668 --> 00:58:51,068 
Told you, l like them.

641
00:58:51,935 --> 00:58:55,996 
Yeah, well. Don't get too close.
They'll turn on you, that's for sure.

642
00:59:01,368 --> 00:59:03,461 
What was that joke
you told them?

643
00:59:04,568 --> 00:59:06,729 
Just my favorite.

644
00:59:06,801 --> 00:59:08,735 
One of Damon's.

645
00:59:12,167 --> 00:59:13,998 
Can you tell it to me?

646
00:59:15,100 --> 00:59:16,465 
No.

647
00:59:34,864 --> 00:59:37,958 
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

648
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:58,032 
You sucker,

00:59:58,097 --> 01:00:01,464 
Hey, fool. Hey, fool!

650

01:02:59,985 --> 01:03:02,283 
Help me up. Get this bike off me.

684
01:03:02,351 --> 01:03:05,115 
- What happened?
- Had an accident.

685
01:03:05,184 --> 01:03:09,120 
Some chick in a Trans Am.
Reckless bitch.

686
01:03:11,117 --> 01:03:14,712 
- What are you guys up to?
- Nothing. Walking.

687
01:03:14,784 --> 01:03:15,773 
Oh, yeah.

688
01:03:17,017 --> 01:03:19,008 
Dad, do you want to come with me?

689
01:03:19,082 --> 01:03:20,674 
We could hang out and train.

690
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:22,411 
Lily and l are doing something.

691
01:03:25,749 --> 01:03:27,182 
OK, cool.

692
01:03:31,083 --> 01:03:33,176 
Well, l'll see you guys later then.

693
01:03:34,150 --> 01:03:35,777 
Have a good day.

694
01:03:41,848 --> 01:03:45,648 
Who does he think he is?
You were right to break up with him.

695
01:03:45,715 --> 01:03:48,843 
No, l didn't break up with him.
He broke up with me.

696
01:03:48,915 --> 01:03:51,782 
Oh, well, you would've. Given time.

697
01:03:57,114 --> 01:03:58,843 
Take me away from here.

698
01:03:58,947 --> 01:04:00,881 
- Where?
- Anywhere.

699
01:04:00,946 --> 01:04:05,406 
- Help me escape.
- OK. Where shall we go?

700
01:04:05,515 --> 01:04:07,506 
Where do you wanna go?

701
01:04:08,446 --> 01:04:11,006 
Home. Wanna go home.

702
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:14,516 
Home's horrible.
You must wanna go somewhere else.

703
01:04:16,547 --> 01:04:20,074 
- Hm, dunno. Be Australia.
- No, not there.

704
01:04:20,146 --> 01:04:22,910 
My ex-wife lives there.

705
01:04:24,346 --> 01:04:26,211 
What? ls she alive?

706
01:04:26,280 --> 01:04:29,044 
Who cares about her? She's a lesbian.

707
01:05:04,476 --> 01:05:07,104 
OK, don't put the blade out.

708
01:05:09,678 --> 01:05:12,146 
- Whoa. Stop the press.
- Wow.

709
01:05:12,208 --> 01:05:14,403 
We've got a fashion model in the house.

710
01:05:14,476 --> 01:05:16,967 
- ls that the makeup you got from us?
- Yep.

711
01:05:17,043 --> 01:05:20,103 
- And your skin's all right?
- Yep. Why?

712
01:05:20,177 --> 01:05:22,975 
- Oh, we were just wondering.
- Oh, nothing.

713
01:05:23,042 --> 01:05:26,443 
l was wondering if l could
potentially still come to that party?

714
01:05:26,509 --> 01:05:28,943 
- Sure.
- Thank you.

715
01:05:30,076 --> 01:05:33,978 
ls this sort of appropriate? l don't
really have any sort of party gears.

716
01:06:58,969 --> 01:07:02,905 
Lily! Lily! Lily!

717
01:07:26,334 --> 01:07:29,861 
Lily! Lily! Lily! Lily!

718
01:08:31,498 --> 01:08:34,695 
Did you have a nice time
fucking my friend Mason Hutchinson?

719
01:08:34,763 --> 01:08:35,787 
What?

720
01:08:35,863 --> 01:08:38,855 
You have a nice time
fucking my friend Mason Hutchinson?

721
01:08:38,929 --> 01:08:41,124 
Or did you do everyone
at the whole party?

722
01:08:41,196 --> 01:08:42,254 
l didn't do anyone.

723
01:08:44,229 --> 01:08:46,754 
Anyway, what do you care?
You've got Tracy.

724
01:08:46,828 --> 01:08:49,092 
We're not going out.
We haven't even kissed.

725
01:08:49,162 --> 01:08:52,097 
Could've if l wanted to,
but l've been too busy training.

726
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:55,090 
Where did you sleep last night?

727
01:08:56,029 --> 01:08:57,553 
- ln the bushes.
- Great.

728
01:08:57,628 --> 01:09:00,392 
l'm up all night
wondering where the hell you are.

729
01:09:00,495 --> 01:09:03,726 
l thought you were dead.
Could've left me a note or something.

730
01:09:03,795 --> 01:09:06,457 
Easy, ''Dear Jarrod,
don't wait up all night long.

731
01:09:06,528 --> 01:09:08,996 
l'll be sleeping in the bushes.
Thank you.''

732
01:09:09,094 --> 01:09:11,688 
l didn't get any sleep last night.
lt's my big day.

733
01:09:11,761 --> 01:09:14,889 
What am l going to tell your brother?
Oh, yeah. Hi, Damon.

734
01:09:14,961 --> 01:09:17,452 
Your sister, Lily, oh, nah.

735
01:09:17,527 --> 01:09:20,553 
Oh, she went to a party and got killed.

736
01:09:20,661 --> 01:09:24,062 
Here's a bit of her leg,
that's all that's left.

737
01:09:24,126 --> 01:09:26,117 
You should be more careful next time.

738
01:09:26,193 --> 01:09:28,559 
l'm not gonna be there
to wait up for you.

739
01:09:28,625 --> 01:09:31,287 
- Gotta go.

740
01:09:31,394 --> 01:09:33,362 
- You ready for your fight?
- Yes.

741
01:09:33,459 --> 01:09:35,927 
l'm gonna cut his damn head off.

742
01:09:37,226 --> 01:09:38,693 
Not that you'll be there.

743
01:09:38,793 --> 01:09:41,785 
You'll probably be off having sex
with heaps of people.

744
01:09:43,692 --> 01:09:45,557 
l'll think about it.

745
01:10:00,290 --> 01:10:03,225 
Can you remind my dad to come?
Because he might forget.

746
01:10:09,290 --> 01:10:12,259 
- Hi, this is Michael Jackson.
- Damon, it's Lily.

747
01:10:12,322 --> 01:10:14,222 
Lily. l tried to call.

748
01:10:14,289 --> 01:10:17,554 
- How's it going down there?
- lt's been pretty weird.

749
01:10:17,622 --> 01:10:20,318 
You want to come home?
l can come and get you.

750
01:10:20,390 --> 01:10:22,187 
No, it's too far. l'll catch a bus.

751
01:10:22,255 --> 01:10:24,780 
You sure? l can leave right now.

752
01:10:24,855 --> 01:10:28,291 
Yeah, no, no. lt goes tomorrow.
l'll be home in time for tea.

753
01:10:28,355 --> 01:10:31,586 
l'll make your favorite, shepherd's pie?

754
01:10:31,656 --> 01:10:34,625 
- Oh, yum.
- You gonna be OK?

755
01:10:34,688 --> 01:10:37,452 
Yeah. lt's just really nice
to hear your voice.

756
01:10:37,521 --> 01:10:39,045 
OK. Well, l'm right here, OK?

757
01:10:39,154 --> 01:10:40,678 
Yeah, l know.

758
01:10:40,788 --> 01:10:45,191 
Well, you have a shaggadelic day,
baby, yeah!

759
01:10:45,253 --> 01:10:47,278 
- Do behave.

760
01:10:47,388 --> 01:10:49,288 
- Bye.
- Bye.

761
01:11:07,719 --> 01:11:10,051 
Gordon jumped off that.

762
01:11:11,452 --> 01:11:15,115 
Look at it, sticking up there
like a bloody tombstone.

763
01:11:18,719 --> 01:11:20,550 
lt was so wonderful when he won.

764
01:11:20,619 --> 01:11:26,114 
l just wanted him to keep on
doing better, you know, to keep winning.

765
01:11:28,384 --> 01:11:30,409 
Maybe that's why he did it...

766
01:11:31,085 --> 01:11:32,814 
...because of me.

767
01:11:33,984 --> 01:11:35,815 
l'll never know now.

768
01:11:38,584 --> 01:11:41,519 
My whole life's a complete disaster.

769
01:11:44,184 --> 01:11:49,645 
You know,
life is full of hard bits, l think.

770
01:11:49,750 --> 01:11:55,347 
But in between the hard bits
are some really lovely bits.

771
01:11:56,816 --> 01:11:58,443 
l mean, Jarrod's a lovely bit.

772
01:12:00,116 --> 01:12:02,914 
- Jarrod?
- Yep.

773
01:12:03,616 --> 01:12:05,982 
- Jarrod?
- Yeah.

774
01:12:06,050 --> 01:12:09,213 
- l just don't think you know him.
- Yes, l do. l know my family.

775
01:12:09,281 --> 01:12:11,340 
Better than you do.

776
01:12:11,415 --> 01:12:13,883 
Oh, what's Jarrod's
favorite animal then?

777
01:12:13,949 --> 01:12:16,611 
- A giraffe.
- No.

778
01:12:18,815 --> 01:12:19,839 
- An octopus.
- No.

779
01:12:19,948 --> 01:12:23,008 
- Well, a cheetah then.
- No.

780
01:12:24,249 --> 01:12:26,217 
lt's an eagle.

781
01:12:29,415 --> 01:12:30,939 
OK.

782
01:12:33,880 --> 01:12:35,472 
Or a cobra.

783
01:13:07,012 --> 01:13:09,537 
- Good luck, Eagle.
- What?

784
01:13:10,244 --> 01:13:13,077 
Eagle. l know.

785
01:13:29,377 --> 01:13:30,366 
There he is.

786
01:13:39,875 --> 01:13:41,467 
Kick his ass!

787
01:13:49,541 --> 01:13:53,238 
- ls this a trick?
- No, it's not a trick.

788
01:13:53,309 --> 01:13:54,776 
Mason?

789
01:13:56,442 --> 01:13:58,307 
Mason? ls it? ls he tricking?

790
01:14:04,642 --> 01:14:07,304 
- Can you move?
- Yeah.

791
01:14:07,375 --> 01:14:08,706 
- Your legs.
- No.

792
01:14:08,774 --> 01:14:10,935 
- Can you feel anything in them?
- No.

793
01:14:17,107 --> 01:14:19,598 
- Ah! Fuck off.
- You felt it.

794
01:14:19,673 --> 01:14:22,039 
- No, l didn't.
- Well, did you feel it or what?

795
01:14:22,107 --> 01:14:23,233 
- No.
- You screamed.

796
01:14:23,306 --> 01:14:26,207 
Of course l screamed.
You hit me with fuckin' nunchucks!

797
01:14:28,938 --> 01:14:31,133 
- You're a cripple.
- Yeah.

798
01:14:33,139 --> 01:14:34,731 
He's a cripple.

799
01:14:36,740 --> 01:14:39,106 
l don't fuckin' believe it.

800
01:14:39,171 --> 01:14:41,901 
Mason, why didn't you tell me?

801
01:14:41,972 --> 01:14:44,702 
- l did, kind of.
- No, you didn't.

802
01:14:44,772 --> 01:14:47,002 
Yeah, on the phone before l came here.

803
01:14:47,072 --> 01:14:50,473 
You said, ''When l'm finished with him,
he won't be able to walk.''

804
01:14:50,537 --> 01:14:53,097 
- And l laughed.
- ls that what you meant?

805
01:14:53,171 --> 01:14:54,866 
Yeah.

806
01:15:02,270 --> 01:15:05,899 
But l've been training.
l was gonna kick your ass.

807
01:15:06,837 --> 01:15:09,271 
- When did it happen?
- About a year ago.

808
01:15:09,337 --> 01:15:10,964 
- How?
- Accident.

809
01:15:11,069 --> 01:15:12,559 
What kind? Car accident?

810
01:15:13,204 --> 01:15:14,569 
- No.
- How did it happen?

811
01:15:14,637 --> 01:15:17,572 
- l was skiing in Aspen...
- Shut up. l don't want to know.

812
01:15:17,637 --> 01:15:20,105 
- Listen...
- Shut up. l'm trying to think.

813
01:15:20,169 --> 01:15:22,433 
l'm sorry.

814
01:15:22,502 --> 01:15:24,595 
What? What did you say?

815
01:15:24,670 --> 01:15:26,035 
l'm sorry.

816
01:15:27,036 --> 01:15:30,802 
For all the things l did.
For picking on you at school.

817
01:15:30,869 --> 01:15:32,860 
Jesus, it was such a long time ago.

818
01:15:35,169 --> 01:15:37,967 
- l'm sorry.
- You ruined my life.

819
01:16:40,231 --> 01:16:41,960 
Jarrod!

820
01:16:43,063 --> 01:16:47,022 
- l'll get you.

821
01:16:47,097 --> 01:16:49,691 
Jarrod! Cut it out.

822
01:16:55,997 --> 01:16:57,726 
Come here! Come here!

823
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:15,528 
Leave him. He's had enough.

824
01:18:13,825 --> 01:18:15,292 
Hello.

825
01:18:21,591 --> 01:18:23,058 
How's it going?

826
01:18:24,124 --> 01:18:25,386 
Fucking terrible.

827
01:18:34,156 --> 01:18:35,851 
Stop following me.

828
01:18:36,956 --> 01:18:38,321 
Let's dance

829
01:18:38,390 --> 01:18:42,884 
Put on your read shoes
And do the blues

830
01:18:42,956 --> 01:18:44,583 
Let's dance

831
01:18:44,655 --> 01:18:48,591 
To the song playing on the radio

832
01:18:48,656 --> 01:18:50,214 
Let's dance

833
01:18:50,289 --> 01:18:53,850 
Put on your red shoes
And do the blues

834
01:18:53,922 --> 01:18:55,947 
Dance the blues.

835
01:18:56,922 --> 01:18:59,857 
lt's ''Dance the blues,''
not ''Do the blues.''

836
01:19:03,955 --> 01:19:05,718 
Let's dance

837
01:19:05,787 --> 01:19:09,917 
Put on your red shoes
And do the blues

838
01:19:43,986 --> 01:19:46,181 
You still watching me, aren't you?

839
01:19:47,086 --> 01:19:48,246 
Yep.

840
01:19:49,150 --> 01:19:51,141 
Why don't you go away?

841
01:19:52,718 --> 01:19:54,652 
Don't want to.

842
01:19:56,418 --> 01:19:57,817 
Why?

843
01:20:00,883 --> 01:20:02,043

844
01:20:03,950 --> 01:20:05,212 
Yep.

845
01:20:10,650 --> 01:20:13,619 
Why are you hanging around me?
You loser.

846
01:20:17,883 --> 01:20:19,544 
lt's not worth it.

847
01:20:22,782 --> 01:20:24,409 
Yeah, it is.

848
01:20:56,647 --> 01:20:58,911 
Do you know we've got
the same mole?

849
01:21:02,481 --> 01:21:05,450 
- What mole?
- This one.

850
01:21:06,346 --> 01:21:07,370 
See?
