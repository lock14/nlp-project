COUNTRY OF MY SKULL

3
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,157
<i>Never and never again</i>

4
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:09,471
<i>shall this beautiful land</i>
<i>experience the oppression</i>

5
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,638
<i>of one by another.</i>

6
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:53,395
<i>I'm not a criminal,</i>
<i>but a devoted servant of the state.</i>

7
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,471
<i>I call upon my superiors</i>
<i>to acknowledge that !</i>

8
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:04,675
Colonel Henry De Jager, South
Africa's number one perpetrator.

9
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,792
Tony, why have me fly 5,000 miles

10
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,998
to interview some white cop
killing back folk,

11
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,117
I can do that in my backyard.

12
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,599
Go there Langston, cover the Truth
and Reconciliation hearings,

13
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:21,115
we'll line up De Jager for you.

14
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,275
Come on, Troy !

15
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,833
- How's he doing ?
- Great.

16
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,029
Go Troy !

17
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,873
Pass it !

18
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,518
Way to go !

19
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:53,031
Dad, you're here !

20
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,115
Well done, good job.

21
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,077
- Did you see that ?
- You were great.

22
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,190
Can we go to Ben and Jerry's
for a milkshake ?

23
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,477
Sorry, I'm going to Africa today,
I've got a plane to catch.

24
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,674
Will you stay with us
when you come back ?

25
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,672
Be good while I'm gone, I love you.

26
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,758
See you, Deborah.

27
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,548
If you learn anything about
reconciliation, let me know.

28
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,352
Let's go, man.

29
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,352
Take care.

30
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:47,190
Johan, where are they now ?

31
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,917
Can you hear me ?

32
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:57,629
<i>Uncle Boetie, are you there ?</i>
<i>It's me, Inge.</i>

33
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,758
<i>Pa's gone after them,</i>

34
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:05,876
<i>he's trying to cut them off</i>
<i>in the bakkie.</i>

35
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,712
<i>Come quickly !</i>

36
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:10,952
This is the new South Africa
you admire so much, Anna.

37
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,958
- Throw him in the bakkie.
- No, boss !

38
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,035
We always give them a warning, but
if they run away, we have to shoot.

39
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,711
- You didn't kill anyone, did you ?
- No.

40
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,079
We got one guy in the leg.

41
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,475
I hate them for forcing me
to pull the trigger.

42
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,836
I hate them for that.

43
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,035
Let the Police handle this.

44
00:08:56,280 --> 00:09:01,559
They're not our Police Edward,
it's not out country anymore.

45
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,550
It's open season on whites now.

46
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:14,952
Don't make us wait until
next Christmas for another visit.

47
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:18,272
I'll bring the boys back
on my own next time,

48
00:09:18,520 --> 00:09:20,795
Anna will be away
covering the hearings.

49
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,673
Bloody nonsense !

50
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,634
- You're a poet, why do this ?
- Because I believe in it.

51
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,989
She does, with a passion.

52
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,028
You've spoken out enough
against your own people.

53
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,273
You should have nothing to do
with the hearings.

54
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:48,117
- They blame it all on the Afrikaner.
- I want to find out the truth.

55
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,756
I don't want to hear their lies !

56
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,958
Where's the Christmas spirit,
gone so soon ?

57
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,949
Don't listen to them,
it's good that you do this.

58
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,954
- I will testify myself.
- Good, Anderson.

59
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,509
Anderson, it's not your business.

60
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,796
It's everybody's business.

61
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,118
Goodbye, Merry Christmas.

62
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,509
Peace.

63
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:17,593
Doesn't your baby brother
get a kiss ?

64
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,360
- Give pappie a kiss.
- No !

65
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,789
Remember where you're from.

66
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,631
Have a nice trip.

67
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:51,631
<i>They are my blood, my marrow,</i>
<i>this is my landscape,</i>

68
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,508
<i>this is what I'm made of.</i>

69
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:58,516
<i>I cannot escape it, I cannot deny it.</i>

70
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,632
<i>Yet, I must.</i>

71
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,835
Seat belts on please.

72
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,235
<i>That's Robben Island over the wing,</i>

73
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,760
<i>where President Mandela was held</i>
<i>prisoner for 18 years.</i>

74
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,953
<i>On the right, Cape Town</i>
<i>and Table Mountain.</i>

75
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,231
Hi, I'm Dumisane Mkhalipi, SABC.

76
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,916
- I'll be your sound engineer.
- Pleased to meet you.

77
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:03,196
Can I give you a hand ?

78
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:12,991
Amnesty applications
coming in thick and fast.

79
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:18,476
- Anna, meet the boss.
- What a reactionary word !

80
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,759
- Felicia Rheinhardt, our editor.
- So glad to have you on board.

81
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,596
I wanted to swot your poetry, but
fell asleep during the first one.

82
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:32,038
"Earth is the colour of blood,
blood the colour of earth..."

83
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:36,559
Sound bites are 20 seconds,
voice reports 40 seconds,

84
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,429
that's all we've got to grab
the listeners by the balls.

85
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,309
We've got a contract with
public radio in America.

86
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,754
Local journalists here,
foreign media there.

87
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:57,638
There will be a press conference
with the Commissioners at 4:30.

88
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:05,639
You allow the perpetrators to go
free, deny the victims revenge !

89
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,668
It is the justice
of peace and compassion

90
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:13,709
that desires to bring people
together, not drive them apart.

91
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,875
Marlon, Melbourne Herald Sun.

92
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:23,319
Rev. Mzondo, since the Afrikaners
were in control of the Police,

93
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,313
are they most to blame
for the atrocities ?

94
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,836
Apportionment of blame is not
the Commission's purpose.

95
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,071
Whitfield, Washington Post.

96
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:35,478
Since only whites benefited
during apartheid,

97
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,150
shouldn't they be held accountable ?

98
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:41,877
Don't lose sight of the fact that
whites were killed too,

99
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,468
many black people
have applied for amnesty.

100
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,151
Anna Malan, SABC.

101
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:53,793
Haven't South Africans specifically
rejected western justice,

102
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,952
in favor of reconciliation,
not revenge ?

103
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,555
How can there be reconciliation

104
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:02,234
when the white possess
the country's wealth ?

105
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,038
We have along hard road ahead,

106
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:09,308
who believed that South Africa
could achieve what it has ?

107
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,152
Hartley, London Guardian.

108
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:13,914
Most of the victims are black,

109
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,674
do they have a special capacity
for forgiveness ?

110
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,232
Or whites have a capacity
for getting away with murder.

111
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,313
Thank you, but that's all
we have time for now.

112
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:29,872
See you at the first hearings
in Mdantsane.

113
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,438
Excuse me.

114
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,079
You don't understand
what we're trying to do here.

115
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,112
I think I do.

116
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:04,032
- You're Afrikaans, right ?
- So ?

117
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:08,398
It's not about blame,
we're trying to find the truth.

118
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:13,749
South Africans want peace,
we're all making compromises.

119
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,118
Compromises like blacks can sit
on your park benches now ?

120
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:21,633
Excuse me.

121
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:28,876
When this is all over,
we have to live together.

122
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:40,678
I can see why they wanted
to keep this place.

123
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,030
Look at this place !

124
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,473
- Are you from the Post ?
- Yes.

125
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:58,317
- Americans care about this ?
- They should.

126
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,551
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

127
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,393
- I was in Kigani for 3 weeks.
- I was in Burma.

128
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,517
Dumisane Mkhalipi,

129
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,877
my friends call me Dumi,
and my enemies too.

130
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,353
- Let me buy you a drink.
- Yes, please.

131
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,475
Anna, I've got the tape here.

132
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:31,512
I'm at the Rhodes Place Hotel,
having a drink with Malcolm X.

133
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:35,669
- So what do you do ?
- I'm Anna Malan's sound engineer.

134
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,036
- That's your partner ?
- Yes.

135
00:16:38,280 --> 00:16:40,635
- How long you've been with her ?
- We just met today.

136
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,359
You're a trip !

137
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:52,955
There's the main reason
my editor sent me over here.

138
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:57,279
Just looking at him on TV
makes me want to shit my pants.

139
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:02,431
There's my partner.

140
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,316
- Have a seat.
- I have to go, Felicia...

141
00:17:09,560 --> 00:17:13,189
Forget about her,
sit down and chill out.

142
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:16,757
You need a big whiskey,
anything for you ?

143
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,559
I'm good.

144
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:32,076
What is African justice,
just saying "I'm sorry" ?

145
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,831
The American journalist
hasn't heard of <i>ubuntu</i> ?

146
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:39,516
Nope, enlighten me.

147
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:42,993
Why do you care,
you've already made up your mind.

148
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,990
- Don't make assumptions about me.
- Don't make them about me.

149
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,550
- Why'd you ask if I was Afrikaans ?
- You don't sound Chinese.

150
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:55,949
Really ?

151
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:01,954
- The tape.
- Thanks.

152
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,192
See you on the bus tomorrow.

153
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,159
Bye.

154
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,712
This is mine now, huh ?

155
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:17,988
Cheers.

156
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:52,552
Look what Langston has rented,
a five series !

157
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,232
- What's that song they're singing ?
- It's a hymn.

158
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,792
"Lizalis Indinga Lakho",
Let Your Will Be Done.

159
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,837
Well where was God
when they needed him ?

160
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,957
He was on our side.

161
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,758
Two places there !

162
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,158
It's all right.

163
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:55,953
Lord, may we snatch the victims
from the death of forgetfulness,

164
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:00,593
may we tell their history,
complete their ending.

165
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:10,117
Mrs Virginia Tabata,
mother of Nyameko Tabata,

166
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,870
please tell your story.

167
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,839
After my son disappeared,

168
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,511
we were told there was a policeman
in Port Elizabeth.

169
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,196
who had this thing in a bottle
on his desk.

170
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:27,194
When he was asked what it was,

171
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,196
he answered:
"It's a baboon's hand,

172
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,514
a bottled hand of a Communist."

173
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:41,233
Before they killed my son,
they cut off his hands

174
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,918
so he could not be finger-printed.

175
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,030
How do I say this ?

176
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:57,591
Give me back my son's hands
so I have something to bury !

177
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,789
<i>In their Sunday best they come,</i>

178
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:07,872
<i>mothers and wives searching</i>
<i>for a place to put their grief.</i>

179
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,800
<i>Truth has become a woman,</i>

180
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,669
<i>everybody recognizes her,</i>
<i>yet nobody knows her.</i>

181
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:37,437
We'll now hear the testimony
of Mrs Albertina Sobandla.

182
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:43,510
Hubert had been missing for 2 weeks.

183
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:47,955
I was worried
because of his weak heart,

184
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,317
he left his medicine behind
on the kitchen table.

185
00:21:54,520 --> 00:22:00,117
I begged the Police to tell me
what had happened to him,

186
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,794
they wouldn't, they laughed at me.

187
00:22:07,720 --> 00:22:12,316
- He wasn't charged with anything ?
- Police can detain without charge.

188
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:15,472
- Those are your laws ?
- Not mine, the country's.

189
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:20,791
To this day, I do not know
what happened to him.

190
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,350
You must tell me.

191
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,753
Let me remind you, Sergeant Dreyer,

192
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,235
to get amnesty you must make
a full confession

193
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:35,677
and prove you were
politically motivated.

194
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:40,952
The decision was made
to get rid of Hubert Sobandla,

195
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:46,831
he was a thorn,
we were instructed to make a plan.

196
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:50,993
What did you understand
by those words ?

197
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:56,708
What we always understood when orders
came down to us: eliminate.

198
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:02,194
Permanently remove from society,
"make a plan".

199
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:06,274
It all meant the same thing,
kill him.

200
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,389
Just murder Hubert Sobandla.

201
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,477
I had nothing personally against him,
I was following orders.

202
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,470
Whose orders ?

203
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,839
We would get told to take
the guy out, it was necessary.

204
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:27,358
To stab him 37 times ?

205
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:35,911
- Hubert fought like a tiger.
- A man with a heart condition ?

206
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:38,470
He was fighting for his life.

207
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:58,795
I apologize to Mrs Sobandla.

208
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:03,951
I've told the truth,
I'm asking for amnesty.

209
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,754
Why is she crying and they're not ?

210
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,873
We did our crying years ago.

211
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,992
"Severed hands, graphic accounts
of assassinations by Security Police

212
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:15,959
marked testimonies today,
as the country faces..."

213
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,958
"The heartfelt cry
of Albertina Sobandla

214
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,751
ushered in the Truth and
Reconciliation hearings today."

215
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,671
Stop it !

216
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,592
Jonty hit me !

217
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:06,033
- What happened ?
- My nose is bleeding.

218
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:08,555
Put it on your nose.

219
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,870
Jonty, come down here.

220
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:16,069
- He's following me everywhere.
- Just come here.

221
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,472
Hold on, please.

222
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:22,160
- It's for you.
- Yes ?

223
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,319
- Hello, Anna.
- Hi, Felicia.

224
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,874
<i>Congratulations, doll.</i>

225
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,917
We loved the scream !

226
00:26:31,160 --> 00:26:33,310
<i>Well done, bye !</i>

227
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:36,791
- Did you bring us presents ?
- Yes.

228
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,155
Stop.

229
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,077
Turn around.

230
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,032
They sent me a black man !

231
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:48,473
- You have a problem with that ?
- I've got nothing against blacks.

232
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,435
What do you want from me ?

233
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,390
What you did,
who you did it to,

234
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,510
who told you to do it.

235
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:13,596
You want to get into the mind
of a man who did terrible things.

236
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:18,272
Your bosses say you're a psychopath
who murdered and tortured

237
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,556
for the fun of it,

238
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,758
it had nothing to do with them.

239
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,634
You think I'm a psychopath ?

240
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,436
Look, De Jager...

241
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:37,600
They've thrown you to the wolves,
don't you want to take them down ?

242
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:44,950
Precisely, we have a common purpose,
let's exploit each other.

243
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,598
The Commission has moved
to the tiny village of Qumu

244
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:24,354
where local Security Police claimed

245
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:28,037
the local people
were harbouring terrorists.

246
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:33,190
The children are off, as the school
is being used for the hearings.

247
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:56,590
I don't speak Afrikaans.

248
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:59,070
- Have they started yet ?
- Not yet.

249
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:02,871
Need a light ?

250
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:20,195
Welcome, Mr Zughufer.

251
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:26,032
Sergeant De Smidt, tell us how you
applied the electric shocks.

252
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,595
We used those little
portable generators.

253
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,230
You make the subject get undressed.

254
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:39,838
- Everything off ?
- Yes, they must be naked.

255
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,509
You attach wires to the subject
and pour water over them,

256
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,910
water's a good conductor
of electricity.

257
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:54,030
Mr Zughufer,
would you tell us your story please.

258
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:58,958
They tied my genital parts with wire.

259
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,753
He !

260
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,998
Then they shocked me, all parts.

261
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,516
My body was turned
to be completely useless.

262
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,799
That which the machine
took away from me !

263
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,510
He wants his manhood back.

264
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:36,270
I'm not an electrician, I didn't know
it would do that to the subject.

265
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,236
And if you had ?

266
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:45,278
I would have lost my pension
had I refused an order.

267
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:51,192
<i>They rise up like the dead</i>
<i>on the day of reckoning,</i>

268
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,035
<i>voice after voice, story after story.</i>

269
00:31:56,400 --> 00:32:02,316
<i>How obediently we sat in that</i>
<i>schoolhouse and learnt a lesson,</i>

270
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,991
<i>the hidden history</i>
<i>of a shameful past.</i>

271
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,796
Anna, the bus is leaving.

272
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:35,636
You don't smoke.

273
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:47,316
You don't smoke.

274
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,590
I need a drink.

275
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,071
I know a place.

276
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,200
I got a car.

277
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:46,514
Wait until you see the bottle shop
dude, he got so fat

278
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:50,072
he can't get out of the door no more.

279
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,268
He lives in there,
they send food in there.

280
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,991
Are you okay ?

281
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,712
- There's no jack.
- Stuck in the <i>gammadoelas</i> !

282
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:17,511
- What ?
- The bloody middle of nowhere.

283
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,598
- What do we do now ?
- I'll call a tow-truck.

284
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,753
- I'll find a jack.
- Don't be bloody ridiculous.

285
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,753
Say no more, I'll be back with jack.

286
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,829
It's true what they say
about the African sky, it's big.

287
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:52,712
- Stuck in the... what's it called ?
- <i>Gammadoelas</i>.

288
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,831
Stuck in the <i>gammadoelas</i>
with an Afrikaner.

289
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,270
Tell me about African justice,
what does <i>ubuntu</i> mean ?

290
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:09,869
It means we're all connected,
what hurts you, hurts me.

291
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,792
If Africans want to praise someone,
they say "<i>Unobuntu'</i>',

292
00:35:14,040 --> 00:35:18,511
it means they think the person's
generous and compassionate.

293
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:23,993
Compassion and forgiveness,
quite foreign to an American.

294
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,873
African American.

295
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:28,839
- I'm not talking about skin.
- Well, I am.

296
00:35:29,080 --> 00:35:34,393
It's all about skin, skin is what
draws the line in the sand,

297
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,109
as an Afrikaner,
you should know that.

298
00:35:37,360 --> 00:35:41,319
- Don't make assumptions about me.
- Don't start with that shit !

299
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:46,557
I'll stop, if you'll stop, okay ?

300
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:51,031
Hey, Dumi's back.

301
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,917
I'm back.

302
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:30,513
You have to say it with feeling...

303
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,750
That's gonna take a few days.

304
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:49,597
- You teaching me about Africa !
- Why not ? I'm African.

305
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:54,118
No, not in my book.

306
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,713
I belong to this continent.

307
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,919
How do you belong to a continent ?

308
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:04,556
I would die for it.

309
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,077
I guess I don't belong anywhere then.

310
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,559
See, if you're black in America

311
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:22,714
you're made to feel
like you don't belong,

312
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:25,838
in fact, they try
to send us back here.

313
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:31,232
Why would I die for a country
where I'm not welcome ?

314
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:38,079
Because one day things
will be different for your children.

315
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,230
- You got kids ?
- Yes, 3 boys.

316
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:47,078
Me too, mine is 9,
he is soccer crazy.

317
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:52,233
I try to make it
to all the matches, but...

318
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,477
The little ones always miss you.

319
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:27,398
I locked the keys in the car

320
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,716
What's she doing ?

321
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,795
Hey, the Ritz !

322
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,391
See if they've got a coat hanger,
I can break in the car.

323
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,477
Is he dead ?

324
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,276
Dead drunk.

325
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:15,148
Did you tell that woman
I was married to Oprah ?

326
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,150
I've made some room for you.

327
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,510
Shut up, Dumi !

328
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,639
Does this place qualify
as the <i>gammadoelas</i> ?

329
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:38,439
No, to qualify
there can't be anything else around.

330
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:44,156
- So there are varying degrees ?
- Yes, it's all very subtle.

331
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:56,718
- Shall we have a cigarette ?
- All right.

332
00:41:57,080 --> 00:42:02,518
- We don't smoke officially.
- I know, but it's something to do.

333
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,518
Maybe we shouldn't.

334
00:42:21,840 --> 00:42:23,637
Maybe we shouldn't.

335
00:42:35,520 --> 00:42:38,796
- What's so funny ?
- I was just thinking.

336
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:42,672
A black man sleeping
with a white woman in South Africa,

337
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,474
a few years ago, I could've gotten
life in prison for this.

338
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,871
What about a white woman
sleeping with two black men ?

339
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:57,798
- What would you have gotten ?
- Possibly a lot of satisfaction.

340
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,913
Goodnight.

341
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:13,155
Why do you think apartheid
was necessary ?

342
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:17,679
Simple mathematics, 4 million of us,
30 million of them.

343
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:24,399
When you're under attack from
terrorists, you do what you have to.

344
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,956
- Including torture ?
- Correct, to get information.

345
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:35,149
That's why we trained the askaris
out there in the <i>gammadoelas</i>.

346
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:37,995
- Do you know what an askari is ?
- Yes, I do.

347
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,471
- When you capture the guerrilla...
- Terrorist.

348
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:47,829
You beat them until they betray their
comrades, they had nowhere to go.

349
00:43:48,440 --> 00:43:50,635
- They made the best killers for us.
- Why ?

350
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,551
They sold their souls.

351
00:43:54,800 --> 00:44:00,875
Betrayal, when you despise yourself,
it's easier to despise others.

352
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:05,398
If your people
hadn't been taken across the sea,

353
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:11,591
if you'd stayed in Africa, would
you be a terrorist or Askari ?

354
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:15,751
Tortured to death by you, probably.

355
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:20,871
Or me, tortured to death by you.

356
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:27,228
Like my mate, Eddie Faouche,
captured by the ANC in Namibia.

357
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:32,474
When they finished, you couldn't tell
if he was a boy or girl.

358
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:38,232
I don't hold it against them,
all's fair in love and war.

359
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:47,112
Five through six.

360
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:52,476
<i>They had pulled out his tongue,</i>
<i>he was mutilated.</i>

361
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:57,072
<i>The only way I could tell</i>
<i>it was my son, was by the feet.</i>

362
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,868
<i>I know my son's feet.</i>

363
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:05,513
<i>His beard was pulled out</i>
o<i>n one side of his face,</i>

364
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,715
<i>one hair at a time.</i>

365
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:15,315
<i>The white policeman said:</i>
<i>"We've got you now, kaffir !"</i>

366
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:18,358
<i>My son bled heavily from the mouth.</i>

367
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,189
<i>I heard shots.</i>

368
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:26,878
<i>I ran, I slipped, I fell,</i>
<i>I crawled out of the front door.</i>

369
00:45:28,840 --> 00:45:32,958
<i>My son was sitting with</i>
<i>his father's face in his hands,</i>

370
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,272
<i>he was covered in blood.</i>

371
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,238
Hi, mom.

372
00:45:37,480 --> 00:45:40,552
<i>To this day, my boy dreams of this,</i>

373
00:45:40,800 --> 00:45:44,713
<i>he wakes up crying for his father.</i>

374
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,270
<i>Every mother's worst nightmare,</i>

375
00:45:49,520 --> 00:45:52,637
<i>powerless to ease the pain</i>
<i>of a grieving child.</i>

376
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,918
<i>Anna Malan, reporting</i>
<i>for public radio in America.</i>

377
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:17,913
Hey.

378
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:22,792
The bottom of page fucking seven !

379
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:29,757
Don't bury what I write in the back
of the god-damn paper !

380
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:36,880
Since when is Police brutality too
remote from the lives of Americans ?

381
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:43,235
How can it be news
when the victims are black !

382
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:53,995
As long as it's black folk getting
killed, nobody gives a shit.

383
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:00,670
It's not always black and white,
sometimes it's fucking grey.

384
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:07,637
- Fucking grey ?
- I'm only joking.

385
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,356
Anna, let's show these people
how to dance !

386
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:19,030
- Something to eat ?
- A little later, thanks.

387
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:51,116
It's for you, a woman
who listens to you on the radio.

388
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:59,511
I have something bad for you.

389
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:06,196
- Your daughter's body ?
- Body ?

390
00:49:13,760 --> 00:49:17,275
<i>We took her up into the hills,</i>

391
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,473
<i>we had to extract</i>
<i>valuable information from her.</i>

392
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:22,633
Here she is.

393
00:49:23,480 --> 00:49:25,311
<i>You raped her ?</i>

394
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:30,158
<i>We kept her naked for 3 days,</i>
<i>but she just wouldn't talk.</i>

395
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:04,072
<i>She asked for some panties,</i>
<i>of course we said no.</i>

396
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:10,918
<i>She found a plastic bag</i>
and made herself some panties.

397
00:50:11,320 --> 00:50:15,472
We asked her to kneel, shot her
through the top of her head.

398
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,876
<i>God, she was brave !</i>

399
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,349
They're trying to convince me
to electrify my fence,

400
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:50,198
they want 500 Rand
just to come round once a week.

401
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:53,000
In 6 months,
they'll sell you another system.

402
00:50:53,240 --> 00:50:55,754
If anybody's left here in 6 months !

403
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,072
Dave Margolis is gone.

404
00:50:59,920 --> 00:51:02,639
He's got a fabulous job in Florida.

405
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:06,793
I guess that's the end
of cardiac surgery at Wits then !

406
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:12,594
- How's the architecture department ?
- In desperate need of a transfusion.

407
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:17,470
Can you rape
with a political motive ?

408
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:21,793
When the Security Police
raped women in detention,

409
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:29,310
they justified it, claiming it was
necessary to extract information.

410
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:35,553
So, do you think you can rape
with a political motive ?

411
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:44,112
Speaking as a lawyer, I suppose
you can rape with political motive,

412
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:51,757
if it's used as torture
to extract information.

413
00:51:52,600 --> 00:51:57,993
Then logically,
rape can be politically motivated.

414
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:04,637
So you think rape can be logical ?

415
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:10,716
Would anyone like some coffee ?

416
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,398
We'd better be going,
it's getting late.

417
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:21,590
Technically speaking, it's
a difficult one to get around...

418
00:52:24,360 --> 00:52:29,559
<i>"Just as the Nazis claimed that</i>
<i>following orders exonerated them,</i>

419
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,633
<i>the South Africans</i>
<i>used the same defence.</i>

420
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:36,793
<i>Is this the human condition</i>
<i>that men anywhere</i>

421
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:40,555
<i>will willingly commit atrocities,</i>
<i>so long as the law allows it ?"</i>

422
00:52:44,840 --> 00:52:46,319
Front page !

423
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:53,032
<i>The story about the mother</i>
<i>who goes to the mortuary</i>

424
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,352
<i>and finds her son</i>
<i>with his intestines hanging out...</i>

425
00:52:56,600 --> 00:53:00,388
<i>You didn't say "She shit</i>
<i>on the floor", did you ?</i>

426
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:04,872
No, "she slipped on the floor."

427
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,874
SOUTH AFRICAN HOLOCAUST

428
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:11,192
<i>I was worried,</i>
<i>we don't allow swearing on radio.</i>

429
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,313
We're on air in five minutes.

430
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:24,158
South African holocaust ?

431
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:29,349
"Every white South African
is as guilty as the perpetrator" ?

432
00:53:29,720 --> 00:53:32,314
How dare you write this crap ?

433
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:36,678
You come barging into my country
with your own fucking agenda !

434
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:43,029
You're trying to prove you're not
guilty for your government's action.

435
00:53:43,480 --> 00:53:46,233
"I didn't know !",
now where have I heard that ?

436
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:49,756
- Didn't know about electrocutions ?
- No.

437
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:55,120
- And tongues being pulled out ?
- Want me to say yes ?

438
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,112
Yes !

439
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:03,910
We all knew things,
but not the fucking details !

440
00:54:05,480 --> 00:54:10,759
You call shooting a woman
in the vagina a fucking detail ?

441
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:15,755
- I don't have to listen to this.
- You do.

442
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:19,555
So you'll never say again:
"I didn't know."

443
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:22,436
Stop it !

444
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:26,880
You're on the air in 3 minutes.

445
00:54:28,080 --> 00:54:29,638
Come on.

446
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:40,673
By sharing their pain, the victims
find some measure of relief.

447
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:43,520
Anna Malan, for SABC.

448
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,039
I'm sorry.

449
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:25,389
No, you're right.

450
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:33,430
I was raised
to treat black people with respect.

451
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:42,597
I did what I could.

452
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:47,670
Drink your coffee.

453
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,995
<i>How far can we go</i>
into every corner of this land ?

454
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:04,189
<i>How much more pain</i>
can we take on board ?

455
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:20,556
We'd been living on that land
for centuries before.

456
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:25,994
We tried peaceful means,
but they never listened to us,

457
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,629
they forced us to take up a gun.

458
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,997
Mr Van Der Weyden,
please tell us your story.

459
00:56:34,360 --> 00:56:38,194
There had already been 3 attacks
in the district,

460
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:42,269
so we travelled in convoy for safety.

461
00:56:43,360 --> 00:56:48,115
We were coming home,
my wife was with the kids,

462
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:54,151
I was in the truck behind
with my brother, we had guns.

463
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:58,635
The truck went through the gate...

464
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:07,270
and over the landmine.

465
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:17,038
Do you know how it feels
to look for your 3 year old son,

466
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:24,755
never to find him,
because he's gone into thin air ?

467
00:57:27,880 --> 00:57:31,111
Do you feel you want to continue ?

468
00:57:36,120 --> 00:57:40,750
The next day we went to look
for my wife's leg.

469
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:45,312
His wife's leg ?

470
00:57:45,560 --> 00:57:49,792
We found my son's skull,
some of his brains were on it,

471
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:55,031
I took it home to bury it.

472
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,753
Why did he bury the brains ?

473
00:58:05,080 --> 00:58:07,674
I have a question.

474
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:27,910
- I feel a fool.
- You shouldn't.

475
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:31,352
I've never lost control like that.

476
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,232
It happens.

477
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:53,154
All the words they used
to humiliate people,

478
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:58,071
the orders to kill
and torture people,

479
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:02,556
were given in my own language,
Afrikaans.

480
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:07,159
The language of my heart,

481
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:12,036
the language in which I wrote
about love, beauty,

482
00:59:12,840 --> 00:59:14,910
tenderness.

483
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:19,434
What does that make me ?

484
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,594
I'm so ashamed.

485
00:59:25,640 --> 00:59:27,596
Don't be.

486
01:00:46,440 --> 01:00:48,271
I'm back.

487
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,471
It's heavy.

488
01:01:03,560 --> 01:01:06,597
There is no greater pain
than dishonour.

489
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:09,870
People at the top
walked away from us.

490
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:14,313
"We'll get you amnesty,
but you're on your own."

491
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:17,950
What's my rank in the new
South Africa ? Not Colonel,

492
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,112
but perpetrator, psychopath.

493
01:01:21,760 --> 01:01:25,878
I was a professional, if there was
a difficult case they called me.

494
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:31,072
- How did they tell you ?
- A wink, a nod, a wave.

495
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:39,397
- We knew it meant "take him out".
- I need proof.

496
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:18,795
- How was your weekend at home ?
- Fine.

497
01:02:19,720 --> 01:02:22,632
- And yours ?
- Dumi took me shopping.

498
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,477
It suits you.

499
01:02:27,360 --> 01:02:30,796
- I missed you.
- I missed you too.

500
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:45,034
The truth shall set us free.

501
01:02:45,800 --> 01:02:48,917
Are they hungry for the truth
or just plain hungry ?

502
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:50,912
Maybe both.

503
01:02:51,160 --> 01:02:55,199
The perpetrators, as in most cases
they're white males.

504
01:03:05,400 --> 01:03:10,155
This child, Peter Makeba,
has not spoken since the day

505
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:15,549
he saw his parents murdered
in front of his eyes.

506
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:23,155
I started to strangle Mr Makeba,
he struggled.

507
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:30,510
Sergeant Schempers
smothered him with a pillow.

508
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:37,596
Then I fired 4 shots
through the pillow,

509
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,237
there was blood everywhere.

510
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:46,834
The woman was hiding under the bed,
Sergeant Schempers killed her.

511
01:03:49,440 --> 01:03:52,000
We didn't know the boy was there.

512
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:55,558
He just stood there, looking at me.

513
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:04,158
I pointed my gun at him,
I was going to shoot.

514
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:10,351
He didn't move,
he stood there staring.

515
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:15,272
I couldn't do it, I defied an order.

516
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:21,594
I can't sleep, when I close my eyes
all I see is him.

517
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:25,990
I'll look after him,
I'll pay his school fees.

518
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:29,638
Please, let me do something.

519
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:28,155
The Orange Free State !

520
01:05:32,840 --> 01:05:36,071
These Afrikaners
were the worst ones before.

521
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:40,072
Your people.

522
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:45,952
My family's from here, I grew up
here, and I know them

523
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:50,196
but I don't agree
with their politics.

524
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:53,273
- Can't you take a joke ?
- No.

525
01:05:54,320 --> 01:05:56,914
Children,
don't make me stop the car !

526
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,429
Disperse, go home.

527
01:06:28,280 --> 01:06:31,158
Some of the Commissioners
were delayed,

528
01:06:31,400 --> 01:06:35,678
the hearings are postponed
until tomorrow.

529
01:06:47,360 --> 01:06:50,033
Postponed.

530
01:06:50,880 --> 01:06:54,555
We can stay at my parents' farm.

531
01:06:54,800 --> 01:07:00,477
Thank you, but I'll go back
to Jo'burg.

532
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:05,670
"Guess who's coming to dinner", eh ?

533
01:07:06,400 --> 01:07:10,393
- What's so funny ?
- Are you coming ?

534
01:07:27,120 --> 01:07:28,997
Come in !

535
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,118
Hi, Anna.

536
01:07:46,280 --> 01:07:48,475
These dogs are very stupid.

537
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:59,160
Mr Whitfield came from America
to write about the hearings.

538
01:07:59,720 --> 01:08:05,511
- He's worked for our family forever.
- I was born on this farm.

539
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:08,991
It's my great pleasure to meet you.

540
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:13,472
It's good that you will write
the truth about this thing we have.

541
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:22,354
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

542
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:24,716
Do come in.

543
01:08:25,080 --> 01:08:28,789
- I'm so sorry about the dogs.
- Anderson rescued me.

544
01:08:29,040 --> 01:08:32,953
You can't be too careful these days.

545
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:35,156
I hear you on the radio.

546
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:39,837
- I sneak a listen now and then.
- I won't tell pa.

547
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:08,999
- Are you the American journalist ?
- Yes, sir.

548
01:09:10,920 --> 01:09:14,993
- Langston Whitfield.
- Willem Malan.

549
01:09:16,360 --> 01:09:22,117
You must have a bad impression
of us Afrikaners by now.

550
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:27,596
I'm afraid so.

551
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:31,029
You don't know us.

552
01:09:43,160 --> 01:09:46,436
Your namesake, Langston Hughes.

553
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:50,912
He happens to be my favourite writer.

554
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:57,751
"Hold fast to dreams, if dreams die
life is a broken winged bird...

555
01:09:58,000 --> 01:09:59,831
That cannot fly."

556
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:06,274
I met him at a poetry conference
in Paris in 1955.

557
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:10,351
He's the first black writer
I'd ever met.

558
01:10:10,920 --> 01:10:14,799
He had such a wicked sense of humour.

559
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:21,791
That's a signed copy,
you can have it.

560
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:27,549
- No, I...
- Please, I'd like you to have it.

561
01:10:28,920 --> 01:10:30,512
Thank you.

562
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:35,194
- Black or white ?
- Beg your pardon ?

563
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:39,190
- Coffee.
- He likes it black.

564
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:50,670
That's Anna when she was about 10.

565
01:10:51,560 --> 01:10:56,839
Here's Anton, Anna gave him the name
Boetie, "little brother".

566
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:03,238
- Do you have children ?
- A son, he just turned 9.

567
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:08,515
- You must miss him.
- I do, very much.

568
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:18,317
My mother never told me
about going to Paris

569
01:11:19,360 --> 01:11:22,033
and meeting Langston Hughes.

570
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:28,879
My mother has a whole history
I know nothing about !

571
01:11:38,760 --> 01:11:43,311
How much do we know
about each other's history ?

572
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:51,830
All we need.

573
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:03,913
<i>King Mthembu begat Bomboyi,</i>

574
01:12:06,600 --> 01:12:09,034
and Bomboyi begat Seduma.

575
01:12:10,400 --> 01:12:13,198
Seduma begat Mngutu,

576
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:17,277
Mngutu begat Jongiliswe.

577
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:22,316
Jongiliswe begat Sabata...

578
01:12:24,240 --> 01:12:30,270
He's naming his ancestors,
placing himself in the flow of time.

579
01:12:31,040 --> 01:12:36,512
Sabata begat Buyelekaya,
Buyelekaya begat me.

580
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:43,358
I am Anderson Dalindyebo Mbashe.

581
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:51,751
On that day my life was affected.

582
01:12:52,480 --> 01:12:55,153
The Police came late at night:

583
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:58,394
"Who's knocking so terribly ?"

584
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:01,795
"Police, open up !"

585
01:13:03,240 --> 01:13:08,314
They were looking for my son,
they said he's a terrorist,

586
01:13:10,120 --> 01:13:12,315
yet he was not.

587
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,759
That white, bald head policeman

588
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:19,310
hit me on my chest.

589
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:25,158
Then they broke
everything in my house.

590
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:30,909
I said to them: "Not even a jackal
does this to the sheep."

591
01:13:31,560 --> 01:13:37,317
I had 5 trees,
they bore me good fruits.

592
01:13:39,240 --> 01:13:43,358
They went outside
and broke my small trees.

593
01:13:45,960 --> 01:13:51,432
Now I want to ask,
why did you break my trees ?

594
01:13:53,320 --> 01:13:56,392
Tell me so I can forgive you.

595
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:05,797
There he is.

596
01:14:13,200 --> 01:14:14,997
Well done !

597
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:18,154
You were great,
you showed those bastards.

598
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,153
I showed them what is <i>ubuntu</i>.

599
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:29,075
We are all part of each other.

600
01:14:29,960 --> 01:14:36,877
When that policeman hurts me,
he hurts you, he hurts everybody,

601
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:39,680
Mandela taught us this lesson.

602
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:46,240
Write about this truth
you've learnt in South Africa.

603
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:50,989
Please take this stick of mine.

604
01:14:53,960 --> 01:14:58,988
It's very important, it tells us
we're not alone in this world,

605
01:15:00,040 --> 01:15:02,031
<i>ubuntu</i>.

606
01:15:23,680 --> 01:15:28,151
Do you feel compassion
for the people you've injured ?

607
01:15:30,200 --> 01:15:35,752
You talk of compassion, I see nothing
but hatred in your eyes.

608
01:15:38,680 --> 01:15:40,910
What do you say when you come home,

609
01:15:41,160 --> 01:15:43,469
when you kiss your wife hello,

610
01:15:43,720 --> 01:15:46,792
or pick your kid up
to tell him a bedtime story ?

611
01:15:47,600 --> 01:15:50,558
"I had a nice day ?"

612
01:15:51,240 --> 01:15:56,473
After you cut a man's throat you tell
yourself you're saving your country

613
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:01,157
from a bunch of savages
who would fuck your women,

614
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:04,040
kill your children...

615
01:16:04,400 --> 01:16:09,269
You tell yourself blacks will drive
this country into the ground.

616
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:14,556
You tell yourself the blacks
need us whites to control them.

617
01:16:14,800 --> 01:16:18,110
This is bullshit !
I've heard it all before !

618
01:16:19,240 --> 01:16:21,071
You've wasted my time !

619
01:16:21,480 --> 01:16:24,199
Goodnight, and fuck you very much !

620
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:29,799
You want to know
what killing was like ?

621
01:16:31,080 --> 01:16:35,551
It was like fucking a woman
for the first time.

622
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:40,590
Sometimes I couldn't wait to go out
at night and choose a kaffir !

623
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:44,389
- You mother...
- You want to kill me, don't you ?

624
01:16:44,880 --> 01:16:47,997
You're just like me.

625
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:54,759
I would love to kill you.

626
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:57,036
Do you know what's saving you ?

627
01:16:57,320 --> 01:16:59,709
An old black man with a stick

628
01:17:00,400 --> 01:17:05,554
and a white woman
who took your shame upon herself.

629
01:17:09,120 --> 01:17:10,951
Wait.

630
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:18,712
I can prove the Generals
knew what we were doing.

631
01:17:22,920 --> 01:17:26,310
There was a farm,
a training facility.

632
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:30,718
- For the askaris ?
- Officially, yes.

633
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:37,276
- And unofficially ?
- It was for recreation.

634
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:42,878
Generals came from Pretoria
every weekend to watch the show.

635
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:45,989
Where is the farm ?

636
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:51,829
- Gonna torture me to make me talk ?
- Where's the farm ?

637
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:56,913
Witorp Farm, near Krugersburg.

638
01:17:58,920 --> 01:18:03,357
Go at night,
your skin will protect you.

639
01:18:13,480 --> 01:18:18,634
It can't be here, I know all
the farms around here.

640
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:21,316
No, it's here.

641
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:46,353
- Stay here.
- I'm coming with you.

642
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:00,195
<i>Mr Tabata knew he was going to die</i>
<i>and asked to be buried</i>

643
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:03,238
<i>with the ANC flag.</i>

644
01:22:03,480 --> 01:22:07,075
<i>He was a brave fighter, I said yes.</i>

645
01:22:17,440 --> 01:22:22,878
<i>The farm was owned and funded</i>
<i>by the Apartheid government,</i>

646
01:22:23,120 --> 01:22:26,396
<i>and implicates the government</i>
<i>in murder and assassination.</i>

647
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:33,077
<i>De Jager exposed his superiors,</i>
<i>thus implicating himself.</i>

648
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:38,397
<i>He faced trial,</i>
<i>by showing he had followed orders,</i>

649
01:22:38,640 --> 01:22:41,871
<i>he was confident</i>
<i>of getting amnesty.</i>

650
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:46,992
We are satisfied
that Colonel De Jager

651
01:22:48,040 --> 01:22:54,479
acted on the orders or command
of one or more senior members.

652
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,909
His application for amnesty succeeds

653
01:23:00,560 --> 01:23:05,031
on the grounds of full disclosure
and a political motive.

654
01:23:05,600 --> 01:23:09,275
But fails on the grounds
of proportionality.

655
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:16,752
The means were out of all proportion
with the objective sought.

656
01:23:18,840 --> 01:23:21,832
Amnesty is hereby refused.

657
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:30,149
De Jager will stand trial
on 63 counts of murder.

658
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:35,791
I killed for my country !

659
01:23:36,680 --> 01:23:39,911
I did what I believed was right.

660
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:08,794
How could you possibly think
what you did was right ?

661
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:12,669
Aren't you Anna Malan
from the farm De Rust ?

662
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:20,793
You want to know how we thought
we were right, ask your brother !

663
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,556
Which brother ?

664
01:25:04,680 --> 01:25:06,238
Why ?

665
01:25:17,000 --> 01:25:21,073
I can understand a bullet.

666
01:25:21,440 --> 01:25:27,709
We grew up with guns,
you taught me how to shoot,

667
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:30,793
I know a bullet.

668
01:25:35,080 --> 01:25:41,713
But the pliers, electric cord,
metal pipe with a condom...

669
01:25:44,760 --> 01:25:46,910
I cannot understand.

670
01:25:50,320 --> 01:25:54,598
I have no place for them in my head.

671
01:25:55,680 --> 01:26:00,515
Help me to know, help me Boetie.

672
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:05,111
Please.

673
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:13,274
I did it for us,
so our people could sleep safe.

674
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:20,438
I got blood on my hands
so we could all sleep safe.

675
01:26:21,600 --> 01:26:24,160
We all knew this.

676
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:30,871
Go !

677
01:27:24,720 --> 01:27:27,598
Ma, we're leaving.

678
01:27:30,640 --> 01:27:37,557
All those years ago in Paris,
I met someone,

679
01:27:39,400 --> 01:27:41,868
a poet from Chile.

680
01:27:43,280 --> 01:27:46,636
Imagine that,
the other side of the world.

681
01:27:48,680 --> 01:27:53,310
We couldn't have been more different,
or more the same.

682
01:27:53,960 --> 01:27:58,829
I didn't tell your father,
I didn't stop loving him

683
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:02,318
not for a moment.

684
01:28:04,440 --> 01:28:07,910
I didn't tell him,
but the lie took something away.

685
01:28:08,160 --> 01:28:12,039
Even if the truth isn't known,
the effect is there.

686
01:28:14,320 --> 01:28:17,312
No more lies, Anna.

687
01:28:25,560 --> 01:28:29,473
Couldn't you just keep it
to yourself ?

688
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,958
You expect me to forgive you ?

689
01:28:37,000 --> 01:28:39,195
You want amnesty from me ?

690
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:42,796
Let's have a fucking hearing !

691
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:48,073
You can confess, and he can confirm
if it's the truth.

692
01:28:53,120 --> 01:28:58,274
I need details,
I need to know everything, Anna.

693
01:29:00,320 --> 01:29:05,838
I need to churn this over in my mind
until it stops hurting !

694
01:29:16,040 --> 01:29:19,032
How many times ? Where ?

695
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:22,034
From when to when ?

696
01:29:25,000 --> 01:29:28,675
- I love you.
- I'm so sorry.

697
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:46,194
- Where's Anna ?
- I don't know, want a drink ?

698
01:29:59,160 --> 01:30:03,278
<i>At the final hearings of the Truth</i>
<i>and Reconciliation Commission,</i>

699
01:30:03,760 --> 01:30:06,672
<i>a Police spokesperson told reporters:</i>

700
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:12,916
<i>Those who committed abuses</i>
<i>were over-zealous or negligent.</i>

701
01:30:13,840 --> 01:30:17,719
<i>No policemen were asked to commit</i>

702
01:31:19,920 --> 01:31:22,036
She's gone, bro.

703
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,829
You've still got me.

704
01:31:36,320 --> 01:31:38,311
Stay good.

705
01:31:46,360 --> 01:31:51,150
Langston's coming over for
the farewell dinner, come with us.

706
01:31:51,640 --> 01:31:55,189
- My wife's cooking a <i>xhosa</i> meal.
- I can't.

707
01:31:55,440 --> 01:31:56,873
Is this for me ?

708
01:32:00,120 --> 01:32:05,717
Thanks for making me laugh when
there was nothing to laugh about.

709
01:32:05,960 --> 01:32:08,315
Thanks, Anna Malan.

710
01:32:13,520 --> 01:32:16,557
Why don't I fill up this
for the road ?

711
01:32:19,720 --> 01:32:24,635
- I came to say goodbye.
- Sorry about your brother.

712
01:32:38,120 --> 01:32:41,237
I told Edward.

713
01:32:44,680 --> 01:32:46,398
You take care.

714
01:32:46,640 --> 01:32:49,837
Thank Christ we're out of here.

715
01:32:55,480 --> 01:32:59,393
My skin will never forget you.

716
01:33:22,640 --> 01:33:24,517
Let's go.

717
01:33:56,120 --> 01:33:59,351
<i>"Out of love, no regrets,</i>

718
01:33:59,840 --> 01:34:02,957

719
01:34:20,920 --> 01:34:23,115
Are you ready ?

720
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:27,193
Dad, you're gonna love this.

721
01:34:27,520 --> 01:34:31,718
Troy's now going to place himself
in the flow of time.

722
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:38,590
My great granddad Jeremiah
got my granddad Jesse.

723
01:34:40,680 --> 01:34:44,798
My granddad Jesse got my dad,
Langston.

724
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:49,348
And my dad Langston got me, Troy.

725
01:34:50,760 --> 01:34:55,754
Anderson said: "A person is..."

726
01:34:57,200 --> 01:34:59,156
What did he say, dad ?

727
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:03,234
"A person is a person,
because of other people."

728
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:10,918
Then he said: "Take this stick of
mine, it's a very great stick,

729
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:15,391
it tells us we're not alone
in this world."

730
01:35:17,640 --> 01:35:22,191
- We're connected by <i>ubuntu</i>.
- That's right, son.

731
01:35:23,560 --> 01:35:25,198
<i>Ubuntu</i>...

732
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:31,471
I learned that word
from another African,

733
01:35:32,040 --> 01:35:35,350
way out in the <i>gammadoelas</i>.

734
01:35:37,240 --> 01:35:41,552
<i>"Because of you, this country</i>
