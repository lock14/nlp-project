1
00:00:19,885 --> 00:00:22,221
- So it is with heavy
hearts, we lay to rest

2
00:00:22,222 --> 00:00:24,222
your daughter Elizabeth.

3
00:00:24,225 --> 00:00:26,557
But let us rejoice in the
knowledge that you have

4
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:30,062
welcomed her into your
kingdom of everlasting light.

5
00:00:30,064 --> 00:00:32,798
She is in the company of
Jesus Christ, who died

6
00:00:32,799 --> 00:00:34,732
and now lives.

7
00:00:34,734 --> 00:00:37,735
May she rejoice in your
kingdom, where all tears

8
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:42,040
are wiped away, united together
with her father in heaven.

9
00:00:43,475 --> 00:00:45,444
Now, and forever, amen.

10
00:01:35,596 --> 00:01:36,596
- Adam?

11
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:45,704
Are you okay?

12
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,209
- Turn it off.

13
00:01:51,644 --> 00:01:52,811
- Adam I think...

14
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:54,813
- turn it off I said.

15
00:02:17,937 --> 00:02:18,937
Sarah?

16
00:02:21,608 --> 00:02:22,707
- Yeah?

17
00:02:24,343 --> 00:02:26,177
- It's all your fault.

18
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,980
- Oh!

19
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,365
- Hasn't changed a bit.

20
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:25,570
- Not since mom died in it.

21
00:03:58,337 --> 00:03:59,937
- Home sweet home.

22
00:04:10,115 --> 00:04:12,417
Well, power's on at least.

23
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,920
Let's see about the water.

24
00:04:23,896 --> 00:04:24,896
- Eww.

25
00:04:29,035 --> 00:04:30,735
- Yeah it's been more
than a few years,

26
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:33,805
all sorts of gunk.

27
00:04:33,807 --> 00:04:35,874
Can't wait to see the toilets.

28
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:05,002
Sarah can you help
me out with this?

29
00:05:56,822 --> 00:05:57,956
- What?

30
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:00,925
- I didn't say anything.

31
00:06:15,574 --> 00:06:17,742
- This is chino's?

32
00:06:17,745 --> 00:06:18,910
- Yeah.

33
00:06:18,911 --> 00:06:20,711
- Ah it's terrible.

34
00:06:21,913 --> 00:06:22,913
- Yeah.

35
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:29,153
- What are we doing?

36
00:06:29,156 --> 00:06:31,555
- What do you mean?

37
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:32,990
- Why are we here?

38
00:06:34,593 --> 00:06:36,995
- I thought coming
home might help you.

39
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,096
- Help me?

40
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:41,932
- Make a fresh
start with things.

41
00:06:41,935 --> 00:06:44,970
Away from all that
happened last year.

42
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:50,074
- Right, and this place is just
full of wonderful memories.

43
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:54,612
- Things are gonna get better.

44
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:55,615
- Better?

45
00:06:56,882 --> 00:06:58,449
Is that what we're doing here?

46
00:06:58,451 --> 00:07:00,552
We're just gonna go back
and live in the past

47
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:03,053
and pretend like
everything that happened

48
00:07:03,055 --> 00:07:04,923
never actually happened.

49
00:07:04,925 --> 00:07:06,891
- That's not what I said.

50
00:07:06,894 --> 00:07:10,362
- My daughter's dead,
my husband's dead.

51
00:07:14,466 --> 00:07:15,733
And now I'm back living at home

52
00:07:15,735 --> 00:07:19,103
which I something I
swore I would never do.

53
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:22,007
- I know it's not gonna be easy.

54
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:24,875
What you've been through.

55
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:25,976
- Yeah.

56
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:33,985
It's just strange.

57
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,887
- Strange how?

58
00:07:36,889 --> 00:07:40,459
- This sudden interest
you're showing in my life.

59
00:07:40,461 --> 00:07:43,093
- Sarah you're my
sister, I love you.

60
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,163
- Come on for 10 years
I was a name on your

61
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,966
Christmas card list, what
did you meet your niece once

62
00:07:47,968 --> 00:07:49,901
when she was a baby?

63
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:53,071
Even after she got sick you
couldn't be bothered to call

64
00:07:53,072 --> 00:07:57,341
and try to be her uncle, get
to know her before she...

65
00:08:01,613 --> 00:08:02,613
- No.

66
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,084
You're right.

67
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:11,156
Growing up you were
always there for me, you,

68
00:08:11,158 --> 00:08:14,658
always had my back with mom,
and when everything went

69
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:18,129
to shit I should've
been there for you.

70
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,697
But I'm here now.

71
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:22,067
- Yeah.

72
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:24,903
Here you are.

73
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,372
Hmm.

74
00:08:29,108 --> 00:08:33,110
Fuck, broke my tooth on
this rubbery goddamn pizza.

75
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,280
- Are you okay?

76
00:08:36,283 --> 00:08:38,048
- I'm going to bed.

77
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,068
- Come on, give us a signal.

78
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:02,706
Yeah?

79
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:03,708
- Can I come in?

80
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:04,775
- Of course.

81
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:10,347
Hey, how's the tooth?

82
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:11,249
- It hurts.

83
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,183
- You want some ibuprofen?

84
00:09:13,186 --> 00:09:14,186
- Nah.

85
00:09:16,254 --> 00:09:19,157
Look, I know you've been trying.

86
00:09:20,525 --> 00:09:22,726
And I really do appreciate it.

87
00:09:22,729 --> 00:09:26,163
- I love you sis, and I'm
sorry I didn't always show it,

88
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:27,264
but, I do.

89
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,601
- I'm sorry too.

90
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:35,506
- You have nothing
to be sorry for.

91
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:38,442
- Look at what I found.

92
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:44,448
- Oh my god, look at my hair.

93
00:09:46,217 --> 00:09:48,720
- Yeah it was
definitely the 90s.

94
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,388
- We look like kid 'n play.

95
00:09:53,558 --> 00:09:55,626
- I missed you.

96
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:57,195
- I missed you too.

97
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:04,635
- I wanna go to bed.

98
00:10:04,638 --> 00:10:05,437
- Okay.

99
00:10:05,438 --> 00:10:06,438
- Good night.

100
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,440
- Night.

101
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,168
- Mommy?

102
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:50,215
- My baby.

103
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:16,073
- Ah fuck.

104
00:11:19,144 --> 00:11:20,945
- Richard?

105
00:11:20,947 --> 00:11:21,947
- Morning.

106
00:11:23,982 --> 00:11:25,517
- What are you doing?

107
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,284
- We've got a busted pipe,
came down to make my coffee

108
00:11:27,287 --> 00:11:29,988
this morning, found myself
swimming in the blue lagoon.

109
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,855
- This place should
be condemned.

110
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:33,857
- It's a water leak, not
the end of the world.

111
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:34,860
- Sorry.

112
00:11:36,227 --> 00:11:39,029
- I gotta go out,
pick up a few things,

113
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:41,466
are you gonna be okay
on your own for a while?

114
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,903
- Yeah I'm not a child Richard.

115
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,071
- I didn't mean it like that.

116
00:11:46,072 --> 00:11:47,138
- It's okay.

117
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,673
- I just wanna make
sure, you know.

118
00:11:49,676 --> 00:11:51,209
- Yeah.

119
00:11:51,211 --> 00:11:53,311
- Can I get you
anything while I'm out.

120
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:54,412
- Coffee.

121
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,881
- Okay, I'll make us some
breakfast when I get back.

122
00:11:57,884 --> 00:11:59,250
- Okay.

123
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:22,874
- Richie?

124
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,274
- Excuse me.

125
00:12:24,277 --> 00:12:27,211
- Richie Doyle, it's me, Jan
Thompson, you went to school

126
00:12:27,213 --> 00:12:28,913
with my boys, I was a
friend of your mother's.

127
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,249
- Oh Mrs. Thompson, hi.

128
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,918
- Hi, oh it is so
good to see you.

129
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,253
- Yeah, same to you.

130
00:12:35,254 --> 00:12:37,187
- What brings you back to globe?

131
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:39,790
- Ah, I guess we just
missed the place.

132
00:12:39,793 --> 00:12:42,360
And I thought Sarah could use
a little country living again.

133
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,195
- Oh Sarah's back too,
oh that's wonderful,

134
00:12:44,197 --> 00:12:46,331
I have to stop in on her.

135
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:55,038
Molly Hanning,
she's a little uhm...

136
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,374
- strange?

137
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,275
- You said it, not me, anyway
I don't wanna keep you,

138
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:00,211
but it is so nice
to see you again.

139
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:01,613
- You too.

140
00:13:01,615 --> 00:13:02,679
- Take care.

141
00:13:40,485 --> 00:13:43,288
- One half through two, to
one quarter to an eighth.

142
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:44,923
- Always the hard part.

143
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,323
- What's that?

144
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:48,659
- Finding the right fit.

145
00:13:48,662 --> 00:13:51,361
Every part has its
perfect counter.

146
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:55,066
But finding that match
is what takes time.

147
00:13:57,302 --> 00:13:58,503
- Yeah, sure.

148
00:14:08,614 --> 00:14:11,481
I uh, I need copies
of these two keys.

149
00:14:11,484 --> 00:14:13,851
- All right, back in a sec.

150
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:25,062
- I'm sorry, can I help
you with something?

151
00:14:25,065 --> 00:14:28,533
- Maybe, or maybe I
can help you, Richard.

152
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:31,501
- Have we met?

153
00:14:31,504 --> 00:14:34,371
- You lost your niece
last year Mr. Doyle.

154
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,472
- That's right.

155
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:38,509
- She was sick but to
go so fast like that,

156
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:42,547
what was it again, got herself
drowned, in the bathtub?

157
00:14:44,015 --> 00:14:46,317
- I don't know who the hell
you are but stay away from me.

158
00:14:46,318 --> 00:14:48,086
- Come on Mr. Doyle you
know something's not right

159
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:51,355
with her story, Adam knew
it, he felt it in his bones.

160
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:53,892
- I'm not gonna tell you again.

161
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:58,162
- Okay, with the bolts and the
keys, that's gonna be 12.55.

162
00:15:17,682 --> 00:15:19,283
- Who is it?

163
00:15:19,286 --> 00:15:22,921
- It's Jan Thompson, from next
door, this is my friend Amy.

164
00:15:24,690 --> 00:15:26,624
Is this a bad time
for you Sarah?

165
00:15:26,625 --> 00:15:28,458
- Mrs. Thompson.

166
00:15:28,461 --> 00:15:31,596
- Well look at you,
you're so beautiful.

167
00:15:31,597 --> 00:15:33,798
I always knew you'd grow
up to be a heart breaker.

168
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:36,967
- You're so sweet,
please come on in.

169
00:15:41,105 --> 00:15:42,440
- Apple pie for you.

170
00:15:42,442 --> 00:15:44,741
- Thank you, you shouldn't have.

171
00:15:44,744 --> 00:15:47,044
- Oh it's a store bought kind
but still I just love 'em.

172
00:15:47,047 --> 00:15:48,446
This is my friend Amy.

173
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,246
- Hi Amy.

174
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:50,548
- Hi nice to meet you.

175
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:51,548
- Would you ladies
like to have a seat?

176
00:15:51,551 --> 00:15:53,283
- Well thank you.
- Sure.

177
00:15:53,286 --> 00:15:54,952
- I'm so sorry
about all the boxes,

178
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:57,989
I haven't really gotten a
handle on the unpacking yet.

179
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,423
- Ah, not at all.

180
00:15:59,426 --> 00:16:02,726
- I haven't had a chance to
go shopping yet, but, uhm,

181
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:04,495
I was just making
some herbal tea.

182
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:07,498
- Tea would be lovely, except
no sugar or cream for me,

183
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,434
doctor says I gotta watch
the sweets and the dairy.

184
00:16:10,437 --> 00:16:12,336
- Yeah, plain's fine for me too.

185
00:16:12,339 --> 00:16:14,706
- I'll be right back.

186
00:16:16,475 --> 00:16:19,844
- Ah, who's this
lovely young lady?

187
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:21,144
- I'm sorry what?

188
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:22,613
- Look at her Amy,
isn't she adorable.

189
00:16:22,615 --> 00:16:24,215
- Oh yeah she is.

190
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,618
- Is she yours?

191
00:16:27,620 --> 00:16:29,019
Well I can tell you for
schools, you're gonna wanna

192
00:16:29,022 --> 00:16:32,590
avoid Roosevelt, but Chapman
has a great little program,

193
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,459
I'm on the school
board there, so I can...

194
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:37,828
- Lizzy actually
passed away last year.

195
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:41,065
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

196
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:43,900
- That's fine.

197
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:48,706
- Thank you.

198
00:16:50,342 --> 00:16:52,643
Oh god, get it off of me, my
cross, get it off, get it off!

199
00:16:52,644 --> 00:16:55,212
Get it off, get it off of me!

200
00:17:00,285 --> 00:17:02,220
- God!
- Are you hurt what happened?

201
00:17:02,221 --> 00:17:04,288
- It was the weirdest
thing, I, all of the sudden

202
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,691
I felt like my
chest was on fire.

203
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,759
- Oh my god.

204
00:17:12,463 --> 00:17:13,730
- Here, please.

205
00:17:13,732 --> 00:17:16,500
- No, no it's fine, I'm
fine, no it's fine, I'm fine,

206
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:18,403
thank you I'm leaving.
- It's fine.

207
00:17:18,404 --> 00:17:19,636
- I am so sorry!

208
00:18:45,959 --> 00:18:46,959
Let me out!

209
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:49,826
Richard!

210
00:18:50,662 --> 00:18:51,962
- Sarah?

211
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,066
- Get me the fuck out of here!

212
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:59,503
- Oh, okay, okay, I got
you, I got you, okay.

213
00:18:59,506 --> 00:19:00,506
Okay...

214
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,583
You feel better?

215
00:19:12,585 --> 00:19:14,684
- No I don't feel better.

216
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:17,255
- Okay just calm down.

217
00:19:17,257 --> 00:19:19,789
- I don't like it here,
there's something wrong

218
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,259
with this place.

219
00:19:22,627 --> 00:19:25,163
- So what has happened exactly?

220
00:19:27,598 --> 00:19:31,001
A broken doorknob,
a popped light bulb.

221
00:19:32,471 --> 00:19:34,305
It seems to me we're just
like par for the course,

222
00:19:34,307 --> 00:19:37,674
when living in a
broken down old house.

223
00:19:41,113 --> 00:19:44,382
Look, you're tired,
you're stressed out...

224
00:19:44,384 --> 00:19:46,049
- so I'm imagining things?

225
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:48,219
- Okay I didn't say that.

226
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:53,723
It's just, you've been through
hell, and with the stress

227
00:19:53,726 --> 00:19:57,394
of the move, I just want you
to look at this objectively

228
00:19:57,396 --> 00:19:58,962
for a second, okay.

229
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:03,300
Shitty old house, with bad
plumbing and rusty knobs,

230
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:07,070
or our mother's house is
suddenly haunted after 30 years.

231
00:20:07,073 --> 00:20:10,942
- No, you weren't there,
you didn't see the...

232
00:20:13,644 --> 00:20:17,248
Last night, when I
was taking a bath I...

233
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:25,756
Maybe I am imagining things.

234
00:20:28,492 --> 00:20:30,760
- Let's go somewhere.

235
00:20:30,762 --> 00:20:32,163
- Go somewhere?

236
00:20:32,164 --> 00:20:34,664
- Yeah, anywhere, I don't
know, some place that isn't

237
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,467
this fucking house.

238
00:20:37,501 --> 00:20:38,501
- Yeah.

239
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:43,773
Just uhm, let me go
freshen up really quick.

240
00:21:27,586 --> 00:21:29,452
- Hi folks what
can I get for you?

241
00:21:29,454 --> 00:21:31,255
- Club soda.
- Club soda.

242
00:21:31,257 --> 00:21:34,325
- A Coors light draft please.
- Okay.

243
00:21:35,727 --> 00:21:40,163
- God this place brings
back a lot of memories.

244
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:43,768
- Not for me, that
might be the blackouts.

245
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:46,002
- Are you sure that
you're okay being here?

246
00:21:46,005 --> 00:21:49,140
- Yeah, yeah it's not a problem.

247
00:21:49,142 --> 00:21:52,076
As long as they serve soda.

248
00:21:52,077 --> 00:21:53,778
- How long has it been now?

249
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,913
- Seven years next month.

250
00:21:57,082 --> 00:22:00,351
- Congratulations,
that's, that's great.

251
00:22:01,752 --> 00:22:04,989
- One day at a time,
that's what they tell me.

252
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,630
- What?

253
00:22:14,932 --> 00:22:17,034
- Here you go, that'll
be 4.50 unless you guys

254
00:22:17,036 --> 00:22:18,669
wanna open a tab.

255
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:20,904
- Hey, Richard.

256
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,976
- Oh, I'm sorry, just uh,
just throw us the tab.

257
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:27,144
- Okay.

258
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:28,913
- Hey are you okay?

259
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:32,249
- Yeah, I'm fine, that's all.

260
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:19,396
- Lizzy?

261
00:23:20,932 --> 00:23:22,165
Lizzy, it's you!

262
00:23:26,270 --> 00:23:29,973
I thought I was never
gonna see you again.

263
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:33,176
I have missed you so much.

264
00:24:01,472 --> 00:24:03,973
- Sarah, what are you doing?

265
00:24:16,387 --> 00:24:19,722
You wanna go inside,
it's nice and warm.

266
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:20,724
Come on.

267
00:24:34,673 --> 00:24:36,039
Just take a seat.

268
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:49,220
- My little girl.

269
00:24:52,356 --> 00:24:53,490
- What?

270
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:56,326
- She wants me to play with her.

271
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:59,663
She came back
because she needs me.

272
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,664
- It was a dream.

273
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:07,136
Did you forget to take
your medication tonight.

274
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:09,940
Or well, maybe mixing it
with beer was a bad idea?

275
00:25:09,942 --> 00:25:11,709
- What, no I saw her.

276
00:25:13,944 --> 00:25:14,845
- You saw her?

277
00:25:14,846 --> 00:25:16,980
- I know that she's here.

278
00:25:16,982 --> 00:25:17,882
- Sarah...

279
00:25:17,884 --> 00:25:20,284
- no, Richard it was Elizabeth.

280
00:25:24,955 --> 00:25:27,525
- Okay, let's get to bed huh?

281
00:25:51,650 --> 00:25:52,982
Hello?

282
00:25:52,984 --> 00:25:55,586
- Saw you at the bar
tonight, sorry I had to leave

283
00:25:55,587 --> 00:25:56,653
so suddenly.

284
00:25:59,723 --> 00:26:01,090
- How'd you get this number?

285
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:03,560
- Sister started to
backslide, you had a chance

286
00:26:03,563 --> 00:26:07,163
to stay out of it,
but now it's too late.

287
00:26:07,165 --> 00:26:10,034
- What, are you
fucking threatening us?

288
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:13,136
- She belongs to us Richard.

289
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:17,840
- All right you listen to me.

290
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:21,211
If I see you within a mile
of my sister I will...

291
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:22,212
Hello, hello?

292
00:26:24,048 --> 00:26:25,148
Fucker!

293
00:28:27,838 --> 00:28:29,506
Wow geez you scared me.

294
00:28:29,508 --> 00:28:32,142
- I need to speak with you.

295
00:28:32,144 --> 00:28:33,242
- Are you just getting
tired of watching me

296
00:28:33,244 --> 00:28:34,411
from your window?

297
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:37,013
- It's about your sister.

298
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:38,382
- What about her?

299
00:28:38,384 --> 00:28:40,049
- You need to leave this
place and never come back.

300
00:28:40,051 --> 00:28:41,151
- Really?

301
00:28:41,153 --> 00:28:43,686
- As long as you remain
in that house with her,

302
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,154
you're not safe.

303
00:28:45,156 --> 00:28:46,490
- You're friends with that
asshole who called me in

304
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:47,724
the middle of the night?

305
00:29:32,871 --> 00:29:35,873
- It's hard to explain
but there's this presence

306
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:38,741
within her, within that house.

307
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:40,210
- Okay I have no idea
what you're playing at,

308
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:42,311
but I've heard all
I'm gonna listen to.

309
00:29:42,314 --> 00:29:43,713
- You can not drink
from the cup of the lord

310
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:46,048
and the cup of demon.

311
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,451
You cannot partake of
the table of the table

312
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:49,853
and the table of the demon.

313
00:29:50,654 --> 00:29:53,323
- Just get help lady, seriously.

314
00:30:02,733 --> 00:30:04,334
Sarah?

315
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:05,669
- It was an accident.

316
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:08,505
- Jesus fucking Christ,
you're cutting yourself now?

317
00:30:08,507 --> 00:30:10,007
Sarah what are you
doing to yourself?

318
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:10,007
- It was an accident.

319
00:30:10,009 --> 00:30:12,976
- Oh I'm sure it was, I have
to take you to an emergency...

320
00:30:12,978 --> 00:30:14,243
- get out!

321
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:17,146
- Sarah, oh fuck,
Sarah come back here!

322
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,316
Ah fuck.

323
00:30:21,685 --> 00:30:23,319
Sarah open the door.

324
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:27,356
Sarah, Sarah open the door.

325
00:30:29,661 --> 00:30:31,260
That's it I'm calling 911.

326
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,996
- Just leave me alone.

327
00:30:32,998 --> 00:30:34,964
- You want an ambulance
here, cops, because that's

328
00:30:34,967 --> 00:30:37,267
what's gonna happen if you
don't unlock this door.

329
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:38,568
Hey, you hear me?

330
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:42,372
That's it I'm dialing.

331
00:30:55,653 --> 00:30:57,554
- This is ridiculous Richard.

332
00:30:57,556 --> 00:30:59,288
- Tell me about it.

333
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:02,392
- Sarah Doyle?

334
00:31:02,394 --> 00:31:03,559
- Right here.

335
00:31:14,705 --> 00:31:18,375
- Why don't you have a seat
upon the bed for me Sarah.

336
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:21,678
Let's see what we're
looking at here.

337
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,413
- It was an accident.

338
00:31:24,414 --> 00:31:25,915
- I'm not so sure about that.

339
00:31:25,917 --> 00:31:27,250
- Go to hell Richard.

340
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,919
- Go to hell, you're
mutilating yourself.

341
00:31:28,921 --> 00:31:30,487
- Sir!

342
00:31:30,489 --> 00:31:31,387
- And she needs to be
committed for her own sake,

343
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,756
she's trying to kill herself.

344
00:31:32,758 --> 00:31:35,392
- Please, sir
you're not helping.

345
00:31:35,394 --> 00:31:37,927
Maybe you should wait outside.

346
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,429
- Yeah maybe so.

347
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:45,602
- Hon, is that true, are
you trying to hurt yourself?

348
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:48,171
- It was an accident.

349
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:51,008
- Well let's see
what we got here.

350
00:31:53,076 --> 00:31:54,510
And you did this today?

351
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:56,012
- Yeah.

352
00:31:56,015 --> 00:31:58,281
- Judging by the scabbing,
I'm guessing you had

353
00:31:58,284 --> 00:32:00,549
your accident about
two weeks ago.

354
00:32:00,551 --> 00:32:01,919
You really should've
come in and see us when

355
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:05,255
this happened, it's
too late for stitches.

356
00:32:05,257 --> 00:32:08,791
This is gonna leave
one nasty looking scar.

357
00:32:19,703 --> 00:32:21,404
- Father burk?

358
00:32:21,406 --> 00:32:22,739
- Yes.

359
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,708
- Ah you know, it's fine I
have rounds to finish anyway,

360
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:25,875
so I'll see you later.

361
00:32:25,877 --> 00:32:27,477
- Okay, okay.

362
00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:31,048
- Uh, Richard Doyle,
St. Martin's basketball.

363
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:34,384
- Oh sure I knew your mother
real well, and your sister,

364
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:35,419
what's her name?

365
00:32:35,421 --> 00:32:36,385
- Sarah.

366
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:38,154
- Sarah how is she?

367
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:40,824
- Uhm...

368
00:32:44,394 --> 00:32:47,230
Not good father, just not
good, she's kind of the reason

369
00:32:47,231 --> 00:32:48,231
I'm here.

370
00:32:49,599 --> 00:32:53,670
Uhm, she's been cutting
herself, and she tells me

371
00:32:54,605 --> 00:32:56,973
it was an accident,
but I have my doubts.

372
00:32:56,976 --> 00:32:59,509
- Gee, I'm sorry to hear this.

373
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:02,179
Look I've got to do a
mass in the chapel here,

374
00:33:02,181 --> 00:33:05,348
in about five minutes,
I could see her tonight

375
00:33:05,351 --> 00:33:08,317
if you think it'd
do her some good.

376
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:12,588
- Uhm, uh, maybe yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah that would be great,

377
00:33:14,424 --> 00:33:16,159
uhm, we're just, we're over
on brook street, my mom's

378
00:33:16,161 --> 00:33:17,426
old house.

379
00:33:17,429 --> 00:33:19,663
- Sure, I know just
where it is, about 6:30?

380
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:22,265
- 6:30, that's great,
thank you so much father,

381
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:24,101
thanks so much.
- Okay, you bet, okay.

382
00:33:24,103 --> 00:33:27,570
- I really appreciate
it father, really.

383
00:33:40,117 --> 00:33:43,452
You should really
try to eat something.

384
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:49,058
- I really wish you didn't
invite a priest over.

385
00:33:49,060 --> 00:33:50,861
- What am I gonna do?

386
00:33:52,230 --> 00:33:55,298
I don't know, maybe
simply talking to someone

387
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:58,535
who isn't me could be of help.

388
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,103
- I don't need help.

389
00:34:01,239 --> 00:34:04,540
For the last time, the
cut was an accident.

390
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,477
- Okay, I don't
wanna argue, but...

391
00:34:09,146 --> 00:34:11,213
Last night, crazy dream.

392
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:16,952
That's gotta be him now.

393
00:34:24,528 --> 00:34:26,663
Father thanks for
coming, please come in.

394
00:34:26,664 --> 00:34:28,297
- Thank you Richard.

395
00:34:33,204 --> 00:34:34,503
- Ah please have a seat.

396
00:34:34,505 --> 00:34:37,239
- Good, good, good, ah thanks.

397
00:34:37,242 --> 00:34:39,175
- Can I get you
anything, coffee, tea?

398
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:40,677
- Oh, no, no I'm fine, I'm fine.

399
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:41,577
- I'll go get Sarah.

400
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:42,778
- Good, good.

401
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:51,954
- Father's here.

402
00:34:51,956 --> 00:34:54,157
- Why are you doing this?

403
00:34:57,561 --> 00:34:59,695
- He just wants to help you.

404
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:02,099
- Whatever, fine.

405
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:12,541
- Sarah, I don't know if
you remember me or not,

406
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:13,577
I'm father burk.

407
00:35:13,579 --> 00:35:14,777
- Hi.

408
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,079
- Your brother
Richard here thought

409
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:19,583
that maybe you needed
somebody to talk to.

410
00:35:19,585 --> 00:35:23,487
- I'm not a religious
person father.

411
00:35:23,489 --> 00:35:25,989
- That's all right, we
can talk about anything.

412
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:27,657
In fact I've been told
many times that I'm

413
00:35:27,659 --> 00:35:32,561
a very good listener, so
just relax and take it easy.

414
00:35:32,563 --> 00:35:37,134
Would you feel better if we
had Richard leave the room?

415
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,936
Richard would you mind
giving us a little privacy?

416
00:35:39,938 --> 00:35:43,139
- Uh, sure, yeah whatever
you think is best.

417
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,141
- Okay.

418
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:04,760
Now I can't help but notice
that bandage on your arm,

419
00:36:04,762 --> 00:36:06,362
how did that happen?

420
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:07,797
- I cut myself.

421
00:36:07,798 --> 00:36:09,932
- Yeah Richard told me,
but he thinks there may be

422
00:36:09,934 --> 00:36:11,534
more to it.

423
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:14,704
- I don't really
care what he thinks.

424
00:36:14,706 --> 00:36:17,673
- Well Richard told me you
had trouble sleeping lately,

425
00:36:17,675 --> 00:36:20,043
that you don't
feel like yourself.

426
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:23,213
- I lost my daughter
to leukemia last year,

427
00:36:23,215 --> 00:36:25,681
and my husband to suicide.

428
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:28,684
So, to be honest I
can't really remember

429
00:36:28,686 --> 00:36:32,722
what acting like myself
is supposed to look like.

430
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:36,525
- I'm sorry, I didn't know,
would you like to talk

431
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,228
about that some?

432
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:39,996
- What is there to talk about?

433
00:36:39,998 --> 00:36:44,701
- Well that tremendous
hurt that you went through.

434
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:47,269
Would you let me pray over you?

435
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,041
Now really you don't have
to change your beliefs

436
00:36:51,043 --> 00:36:54,577
or anything, I just would
like to say a prayer over you

437
00:36:54,579 --> 00:36:56,445
in the name of Christ.

438
00:36:59,916 --> 00:37:04,221
Maybe I'm pushing it too
much, I, I do that sometimes.

439
00:37:06,157 --> 00:37:10,427
- No I'm, it's okay father,
you can say your blessing.

440
00:37:11,829 --> 00:37:14,130
- All right let's hold hands.

441
00:37:15,666 --> 00:37:18,702
Heavenly father, we ask
for your blessings upon

442
00:37:18,704 --> 00:37:21,003
your daughter Sarah.

443
00:37:21,005 --> 00:37:22,938
We ask you to protect...

444
00:37:23,742 --> 00:37:25,041
- Oh my god!

445
00:37:25,043 --> 00:37:27,844
- Father, hey father you okay?

446
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:39,588
Hey father you okay?

447
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:40,590
Father!

448
00:37:41,891 --> 00:37:42,925
Hey, you okay?

449
00:37:47,364 --> 00:37:50,367
- There's nothing more I
can do here, I've got to go.

450
00:37:50,369 --> 00:37:51,900
- What, hey wait a minute!

451
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:54,336
- I've gotta go.

452
00:37:56,873 --> 00:37:58,375
- Hey, father hold on.

453
00:37:58,376 --> 00:37:59,809
- You've gotta get outta here.

454
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:01,143
- What?

455
00:38:01,146 --> 00:38:02,478
- There's nothing more I
can do for her tonight,

456
00:38:02,481 --> 00:38:05,148
but I know a man, he's a
professor at the u of a,

457
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:07,717
his name is father
Francis Campbell,

458
00:38:07,719 --> 00:38:10,820
now he's supposed to be an
expert at this sort of thing.

459
00:38:10,822 --> 00:38:12,554
- What are you talking
about, what sort of think?

460
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:13,722
- Possession.

461
00:38:17,728 --> 00:38:19,596
- Unbelievable, I turn
to this guy for help

462
00:38:19,597 --> 00:38:23,132
and he fires back with
a bunch of lunacy.

463
00:38:23,135 --> 00:38:24,434
We're gonna have to
get some real help

464
00:38:24,436 --> 00:38:25,467
from an actual mental
health professional,

465
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:27,903
not some demented old priest.

466
00:38:48,958 --> 00:38:52,228
What the fuck, you
cut yourself again?

467
00:38:53,463 --> 00:38:54,931
- Richard don't.

468
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:58,101
- Sarah you are fucking crazy.

469
00:38:58,103 --> 00:38:59,936
- You don't understand.

470
00:39:00,804 --> 00:39:02,105
I need...

471
00:39:02,106 --> 00:39:03,505
- what you need
to kill yourself?

472
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,574
- I need to be with her.

473
00:39:06,443 --> 00:39:07,643
She's here.

474
00:39:07,646 --> 00:39:10,179
- Oh she's here, Lizzy's
here, right okay,

475
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:13,449
Lizzy come out, come
out wherever you are.

476
00:39:13,452 --> 00:39:16,518
Oh I don't see her Sarah,
maybe she's hiding from us,

477
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:19,789
right, Lizzy, hello,
well she's not in there,

478
00:39:19,791 --> 00:39:22,692
maybe in here, no, oh, I know,

479
00:39:22,693 --> 00:39:26,362
right, she's in the
cellar right, yeah okay.

480
00:39:28,231 --> 00:39:30,934
Where's my fucking flashlight?

481
00:39:31,835 --> 00:39:32,869
Fuck it.

482
00:39:32,871 --> 00:39:34,336
- Richard don't go down there.

483
00:39:34,338 --> 00:39:35,338
Richard!

484
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:41,378
- Whoever's in here come on.

485
00:39:48,085 --> 00:39:49,985
It smells like shit.

486
00:39:52,188 --> 00:39:53,889
That's great, so along
with everything else

487
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:57,927
just falling to shit, we
got a ruptured sewage line.

488
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,380
Sarah?

489
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:25,155
I don't know how much
longer I can do this.

490
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:32,695
I'm going out.

491
00:41:39,697 --> 00:41:41,498
- Mommy?

492
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:42,500
- Lizzy?

493
00:41:44,635 --> 00:41:46,635
The doctors said you have
to go back to the hospital

494
00:41:46,637 --> 00:41:48,304
if you're not eating everyday.

495
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:50,273
She's not responding to
the marrow transplant,

496
00:41:50,275 --> 00:41:51,974
this isn't something
you get better from.

497
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:53,208
- Mom it hurts.

498
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:54,543
- Lizzy?

499
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:56,112
- Well forgive me if I'm
not willing to give up

500
00:41:56,114 --> 00:41:58,146
on our daughter yet.

501
00:41:58,148 --> 00:41:59,882
- But I already took one today.

502
00:41:59,885 --> 00:42:03,418
- We uh, we need to
get you feeling better.

503
00:42:04,454 --> 00:42:07,023
So we're gonna take a few more.

504
00:42:11,161 --> 00:42:13,530
- I'm so tired mommy.

505
00:42:16,166 --> 00:42:18,333
- It kills its own,
she's with us now.

506
00:42:22,139 --> 00:42:25,041
- Get out Lizzy, what are you?

507
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:26,742
- It's all your fault.

508
00:42:31,483 --> 00:42:32,815
- I'm so sorry.

509
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:36,251
- Give yourself to us.

510
00:42:37,922 --> 00:42:40,889
It's the only way
to stop the pain.

511
00:43:04,014 --> 00:43:06,114
- What can I get you?

512
00:43:06,117 --> 00:43:07,550
- Shot and a beer.

513
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:09,885
- Be more specific?

514
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:13,088
- Whiskey, anything
Irish if you have it,

515
00:43:13,090 --> 00:43:14,090
beer, anything dark.

516
00:43:14,092 --> 00:43:15,190
- Okay.

517
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,442
- Mrs. Baley?

518
00:43:34,378 --> 00:43:35,378
Mrs. Baley?

519
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:36,278
- Father?

520
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,315
- Oh, you scared me Mrs. Baley.

521
00:43:39,317 --> 00:43:40,916
I've gotta do some
work in the study,

522
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:43,152
would you bring me a scotch.

523
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:14,884
- One of those days?

524
00:44:16,452 --> 00:44:18,655
- You can say that again.

525
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:27,195
- I've never seen
you in here before.

526
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:33,036
- I don't wanna be rude, I uh,

527
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:37,172
I don't think I'd be the
best company right now.

528
00:44:37,175 --> 00:44:39,474
- I don't know, you show more
promise than what's usually

529
00:44:39,476 --> 00:44:40,476

530
00:44:45,481 --> 00:44:47,182
- How old are you?

531
00:44:48,552 --> 00:44:49,719
- Old enough.

532
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:57,360
- Hey buddy, another
whiskey, and,

533
00:45:00,463 --> 00:45:04,132
give the lady whatever
it is she's having.

534
00:45:13,378 --> 00:45:14,976
Hello you've reached

535
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:16,913
the cellphone of father
frank Campbell, please leave

536
00:45:16,914 --> 00:45:18,914
a message, thank you.

537
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:22,150
- Hi father frank, this
is father James burk.

538
00:45:22,152 --> 00:45:26,155
We met last year at the
archbishop's fundraiser shindig.

539
00:45:26,157 --> 00:45:30,693
Father what I have to say
is, well it's unbelievable,

540
00:45:30,695 --> 00:45:33,528
I paid a visit to a
former parishioner of mine

541
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:37,567
named Sarah Doyle, and
there's no easy way

542
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:40,302
to say this, but
I saw something.

543
00:45:41,438 --> 00:45:43,773
And it spoke to me,
I need you call me

544
00:45:43,775 --> 00:45:46,943
as soon as you get this,
please it's urgent,

545
00:45:46,945 --> 00:45:49,512
I can't stress that
enough, and my phone number

546
00:45:49,514 --> 00:45:50,980
is 632-592-6789.

547
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:58,320
Please, call me as soon
as you get this message.

548
00:46:06,429 --> 00:46:08,063
Mrs. Baley.

549
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:09,498
- She's gone home.

550
00:46:10,967 --> 00:46:14,603
- Who are you, and what
are you doing in my home?

551
00:46:24,581 --> 00:46:25,581
- Whew.

552
00:46:26,717 --> 00:46:28,217
- You're really
putting 'em down.

553
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:30,286
- Yes, I really am.

554
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:32,221
How many is that?

555
00:46:32,222 --> 00:46:35,291
Fuck I don't care,
hey, uh, another!

556
00:46:37,260 --> 00:46:38,960
- In for a penny,
in for a pound.

557
00:46:38,963 --> 00:46:43,766
- Yes, let it wash away
the sins.

558
00:46:43,768 --> 00:46:46,302
- So, you wanna get outta here?

559
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:51,139
- Really, I mean, I mean...

560
00:46:53,342 --> 00:46:54,976
Yeah.

561
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:58,014
- Think you can follow the road?

562
00:46:58,016 --> 00:47:00,382
- Well I guess we'll find out.

563
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:05,487
I just gotta, first.

564
00:47:29,378 --> 00:47:32,414
- Quite the looker
you got there.

565
00:47:33,382 --> 00:47:34,617
- What's that?

566
00:47:34,619 --> 00:47:36,952
- Just saying good for you.

567
00:47:38,487 --> 00:47:40,755
Having a little backslide?

568
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:44,726
Hanging under the
wagon isn't easy.

569
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:50,032
Looks like sister Sarah is
starting to come around.

570
00:47:50,034 --> 00:47:52,168
Finally ready to admit
little Lizzy had some help

571
00:47:52,170 --> 00:47:54,469
filling her lungs with water.

572
00:47:55,672 --> 00:47:59,074
You should ask her,
she'll tell you now.

573
00:48:03,679 --> 00:48:06,514
- Are you following me again?

574
00:48:06,516 --> 00:48:08,083
- Always Mr. Doyle.

575
00:48:09,552 --> 00:48:11,387
Always and forever.

576
00:48:15,525 --> 00:48:20,061
That's it Mr. Doyle, good,
let it out, let it all out.

577
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,197
- I fucking warned you.

578
00:48:23,201 --> 00:48:24,833
Who the hell are you,
why are you following me?

579
00:48:24,835 --> 00:48:27,036
Tell me who you really are,
what the fuck you want?

580
00:48:27,038 --> 00:48:29,905
- I want you to be a man
for once, take that pretty

581
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:32,208
little thing out there
back to your place

582
00:48:32,210 --> 00:48:34,277
and fuck her brains out.

583
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:38,581
- If I ever see you again,
I'll fucking kill you.

584
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:40,715
Call me, or mention
or my sister again...

585
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:43,686
- you'll fucking
kill me, I got it.

586
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:47,422
- Yeah he's been following me.

587
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:48,425
Fuck!

588
00:48:52,896 --> 00:48:54,362
I gotta go.

589
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:55,364
- Oh hey.

590
00:48:56,565 --> 00:48:58,634
- Maybe some other time.

591
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:06,242
- Father?

592
00:49:07,277 --> 00:49:09,144
I'm sorry but I forgot
my dang phone charger,

593
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:12,315
and lord knows if I'm
not reachable I...

594
00:49:12,317 --> 00:49:13,548
Father?

595
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:17,152
- Whoever believes in
me shall never die.

596
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:59,894
- How'd you know
where to find me?

597
00:50:07,438 --> 00:50:09,505
- Never in lust I've conceived
to bringeth forth sin

598
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:13,541
and sin, when it is finished,
bringeth forth death.

599
00:50:15,012 --> 00:50:17,512
Even when I walk through
a valley of deep darkness,

600
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:21,550
I shall not be afraid,
for you are with me.

601
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:22,784
You are with me!

602
00:51:07,063 --> 00:51:08,164
- Sarah?

603
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:09,831
Get off of me!

604
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:16,005
- What's the matter,
isn't it everything

605
00:51:16,007 --> 00:51:18,273
you always hoped it would be?

606
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:20,842
- What did you do to yourself?

607
00:51:20,844 --> 00:51:23,512
- We're gonna have
a baby Richard.

608
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:38,594
- I my lord,
my god, I pray up to you

609
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:42,864
to hear me,
hear me and protect me.

610
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:20,202
- Hey you alive in there?

611
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:26,242
- What?

612
00:52:26,244 --> 00:52:27,876
- Are you all right?

613
00:52:28,744 --> 00:52:30,411
- Who are you?

614
00:52:30,414 --> 00:52:34,282
- It's my house you're
parked in front of.

615
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:35,284
- Oh.

616
00:52:36,085 --> 00:52:37,987
- You're drunk?

617
00:52:37,989 --> 00:52:38,989
- No.

618
00:52:40,322 --> 00:52:43,893
- Well look, you're blocking
my driveway, you mind moving?

619
00:52:44,760 --> 00:52:46,427
- What the hell?

620
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:50,298
- Are you gonna move or am I
gonna have to call the cops?

621
00:52:55,271 --> 00:52:56,271
Asshole.

622
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,447
- Father burk.

623
00:53:07,650 --> 00:53:10,018
Father burk, it's rich Doyle.

624
00:53:19,963 --> 00:53:21,396
Hello?

625
00:53:21,398 --> 00:53:22,831
- He's not there, Richard.

626
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:24,166
- What?

627
00:53:24,168 --> 00:53:28,170
- Crazy old fool cut
his own tongue out last night.

628
00:53:28,172 --> 00:53:30,639
- This was you, you did this.

629
00:53:30,641 --> 00:53:32,041
- I'm just a voice.

630
00:53:32,043 --> 00:53:36,644
A messenger, and my message to
you is to stop fighting this.

631
00:53:36,646 --> 00:53:38,213
- Well that's not gonna happen.

632
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:52,561
- Can I help you sir?

633
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:54,396
- I'm not sure if you can,
do you have father James burk

634
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:55,431
as one of your patients?

635
00:53:55,432 --> 00:53:56,664
- Excuse me sir.

636
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:57,699
- Yeah?

637
00:53:57,702 --> 00:53:59,001
- You're looking
for father burk.

638
00:53:59,003 --> 00:54:00,568
- That's right.

639
00:54:00,570 --> 00:54:02,704
- I'm Dr. Cathy Monroe, I'm
father burk's attending.

640
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:07,342
Father burk's been incredibly
insistent that we find you.

641
00:54:07,344 --> 00:54:09,077
- How did you know where I was?

642
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:12,648
- Lucky guess, are
you a relative of his?

643
00:54:13,617 --> 00:54:15,784
- No, uh, friend I guess.

644
00:54:17,286 --> 00:54:19,855
- Okay well, follow me.

645
00:54:30,699 --> 00:54:31,800
- Father?

646
00:54:35,704 --> 00:54:39,974
- Can you shed any light on why
he would do this to himself?

647
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:53,889
What, what does it say.

648
00:54:54,824 --> 00:54:56,125
- Find father Campbell.

649
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,293
- Who's that?

650
00:55:02,565 --> 00:55:04,166
- I gotta go.

651
00:55:04,168 --> 00:55:05,733
- Hey, Mr. Doyle!

652
00:55:24,286 --> 00:55:27,856
- I cast you out, out
in the name of god!

653
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:33,262
Riddley go ahead,
Riddley go ahead.

654
00:55:36,865 --> 00:55:39,001
Now this concludes what
we can submit to you

655
00:55:39,003 --> 00:55:40,936
as documented evidence
of the existence

656
00:55:40,938 --> 00:55:42,670
of demonic phenomena.

657
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,706
Now, I know what many
of you are thinking,

658
00:55:44,708 --> 00:55:46,842
and you're right, there's
nothing that you haven't seen

659
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:49,945
or heard here today that
couldn't be explained away

660
00:55:49,947 --> 00:55:52,780
by a more conventional
explanation.

661
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:54,983
Sadly, the only way to
truly convince a skeptic

662
00:55:54,985 --> 00:55:57,518
of our findings is to
have you come along

663
00:55:57,521 --> 00:56:00,456
the next time we
encounter one of these...

664
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:03,726
And, no, we don't
give exorcism tours.

665
00:56:04,860 --> 00:56:05,860
- Why not?

666
00:56:06,862 --> 00:56:09,530
- Oh, well that's
a fair question.

667
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:11,199
And the answer is simple.

668
00:56:11,202 --> 00:56:13,068
Once the demonic presence
leaves the possessed

669
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:16,472
it doesn't simply vanish or
return from where it came from,

670
00:56:16,474 --> 00:56:18,974
like any other parasite
deprived of its host,

671
00:56:18,976 --> 00:56:20,909
it would desperately
try to attach itself

672
00:56:20,911 --> 00:56:22,643
to something or someone else.

673
00:56:22,646 --> 00:56:24,612
- Okay, something else?

674
00:56:26,014 --> 00:56:27,882
- Yes, in certain instances
the demonic phenomena

675
00:56:27,885 --> 00:56:30,753
will attach itself to
an inanimate object.

676
00:56:30,755 --> 00:56:33,521
- Like a talking doll?

677
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:37,893
- There's nothing funny
about demonic phenomena.

678
00:56:37,894 --> 00:56:39,862
Now, you can come up
with your own theories

679
00:56:39,864 --> 00:56:42,697
that you might consider
less fantastical to explain

680
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:47,503
away our findings, you can
call us frauds if you wish,

681
00:56:47,505 --> 00:56:49,871
or you can see things
for what they are.

682
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:53,041
If you employ a little
thing called faith.

683
00:56:53,043 --> 00:56:54,043
- Faith?

684
00:56:55,844 --> 00:56:58,914
- Yes, I know, the
five letter curse word

685
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:02,684
to every scientific
mind, but, yes, faith.

686
00:57:02,686 --> 00:57:05,686
And it's frustrating, but in
the age of audio and video

687
00:57:05,688 --> 00:57:09,023
recording, it still
comes down to that,

688
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:12,293
a matter of faith.

689
00:57:12,295 --> 00:57:14,530
- Well that's all we have
time for this afternoon,

690
00:57:14,532 --> 00:57:16,297
but if you will join me
in a round of applause

691
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,865
for our speakers.

692
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:22,871
- Father Francis?

693
00:57:25,375 --> 00:57:27,208
I'm uh, Richard Doyle.

694
00:57:30,112 --> 00:57:32,581
Father James burk seemed
to think you might

695
00:57:32,583 --> 00:57:34,550
be able to help me.

696
00:57:34,552 --> 00:57:36,751
- I got a call from
him last night.

697
00:57:36,753 --> 00:57:38,253
What can I do for you?

698
00:57:38,255 --> 00:57:40,655
- It's very hard to say, I,

699
00:57:42,925 --> 00:57:44,992
maybe if you could
just come with me.

700
00:57:44,994 --> 00:57:47,094
- I'm sorry, but I have a
six o'clock tomorrow night

701
00:57:47,097 --> 00:57:49,331
in Bakersfield, if you
wanna make an appointment.

702
00:57:49,333 --> 00:57:52,000
- No, no, no, no, no, no listen.

703
00:57:53,268 --> 00:57:54,735
This can't wait.

704
00:57:56,306 --> 00:57:57,572
- Okay, go on.

705
00:58:00,275 --> 00:58:02,844
- I don't know how
else to describe it,

706
00:58:02,847 --> 00:58:05,380
he was trying to help us and...

707
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:12,086
He cut out his own tongue,
he, he's in the hospital,

708
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:14,556
he's gone completely insane.

709
00:58:17,527 --> 00:58:20,596
- You've seen a
demonic haven't you?

710
00:58:24,199 --> 00:58:27,503
It's gonna be all
right, come with me.

711
00:58:32,007 --> 00:58:34,108
- Okay, we're all set.

712
00:58:35,644 --> 00:58:36,677
- It's okay, just relax.

713
00:58:40,717 --> 00:58:44,552
- About a year ago, my sister
Sarah lost her daughter,

714
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:48,856
Elizabeth, her husband took
his own life a few days later.

715
00:58:52,628 --> 00:58:55,163
- And how did the child die?

716
00:58:55,164 --> 00:58:56,197
- She drowned.

717
00:58:58,367 --> 00:59:00,434
- So this was unexpected?

718
00:59:01,570 --> 00:59:04,306
- Well sort of,
she had leukemia,

719
00:59:06,041 --> 00:59:09,244
and the treatments
weren't helping.

720
00:59:12,715 --> 00:59:16,717
One night she just fell
asleep in the bathtub

721
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,219
and that was it.

722
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:21,623
I know Adam blamed Sarah.

723
00:59:22,992 --> 00:59:23,992
- I see.

724
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:29,264
- So I moved Sarah and I
back to our childhood home,

725
00:59:30,699 --> 00:59:34,835
I thought maybe the familiar
could and help cope with

726
00:59:34,838 --> 00:59:39,106
things a bit better, but, she
started having these dreams.

727
00:59:41,043 --> 00:59:43,110
Nightmares, about Lizzy.

728
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:52,853
Things got a lot worse.

729
00:59:55,391 --> 00:59:58,260
She's, she started
hearing voices.

730
00:59:59,228 --> 01:00:01,195
Lizzy and other voices.

731
01:00:04,067 --> 01:00:05,900
And then she started
cutting herself.

732
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:07,335
- Cutting herself?

733
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:11,840
- And there were
these strange symbols.

734
01:00:14,543 --> 01:00:16,478
- What kind of symbols?

735
01:00:17,813 --> 01:00:22,117
- I don't know, not like
anything I've ever seen before.

736
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,157
All over her body.

737
01:00:31,059 --> 01:00:34,295
She had these scars,
like brands of

738
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,369
ruins of some kind.

739
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:44,239
- Can you draw them for me?

740
01:00:45,507 --> 01:00:47,409
Just do the best you can.

741
01:01:11,833 --> 01:01:13,869
Are you sure about this?

742
01:01:13,871 --> 01:01:18,172
- Yeah, I only saw it
for a second, but, yeah.

743
01:01:18,175 --> 01:01:19,175
- Wow.

744
01:01:22,844 --> 01:01:25,179
- That's interesting.

745
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:26,181
- What?

746
01:01:27,115 --> 01:01:30,851
- It looks like the
second mark of belial.

747
01:01:30,853 --> 01:01:32,788
- What's that?

748
01:01:32,789 --> 01:01:35,523
- Well it's rare, in all
my life I've only seen it

749
01:01:35,525 --> 01:01:36,724
twice before.

750
01:01:38,293 --> 01:01:40,295
- What does it mean?

751
01:01:40,297 --> 01:01:41,996
- Well.
- Well.

752
01:01:41,998 --> 01:01:44,298
- According to myth,
belial is one of the seven

753
01:01:44,300 --> 01:01:46,168
princes of hell.

754
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:48,235
A creature of immense power
with ability to take on

755
01:01:48,237 --> 01:01:52,039
many forms, and most
commonly among these would be

756
01:01:52,041 --> 01:01:55,043
a recently deceased person,
which led ancient sources

757
01:01:55,045 --> 01:01:58,480
to mistakenly connect
him with necromancy.

758
01:02:00,483 --> 01:02:03,485
But what concerns me
the most about this

759
01:02:03,487 --> 01:02:05,853
is that this is the first
time I've seen this symbol

760
01:02:05,856 --> 01:02:09,224
outside of a 1,200
year old manuscript.

761
01:02:13,996 --> 01:02:15,831
I think we're gonna have
to cancel on Bakersfield.

762
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:18,599
- Yeah.

763
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:22,336
- Oh wait, wait there's more.

764
01:02:22,338 --> 01:02:25,172
- Yeah, you can
tell us on the road.

765
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:16,391
- I saw heaven standing
open and the white horse,

766
01:03:16,393 --> 01:03:19,226
whose rider is called
faithful and true.

767
01:03:19,228 --> 01:03:22,396
With justice he
judges and makes war.

768
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:32,173
The lord is my Shepherd,
I shall not want!

769
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:34,242
He is my savior
and my protector.

770
01:03:37,813 --> 01:03:41,882
- Does it not see, is it
blind from all its watching?

771
01:03:43,753 --> 01:03:48,023
- Jesus, protect me,

772
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:51,025
the power and the glory...

773
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:53,327
I shall ever overcome!

774
01:03:53,329 --> 01:03:54,829
Darkness shall never ever!

775
01:04:00,302 --> 01:04:03,438
- Molly, oh Molly,
Molly you freed me!

776
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:09,110
Molly your faith has redeemed
and defeated the evil one.

777
01:04:10,313 --> 01:04:14,516
Oh praise you and praise
god for bringing you to me.

778
01:04:14,518 --> 01:04:18,719
- For we are all sinners,
and only through him,

779
01:04:18,722 --> 01:04:20,355
only through him.

780
01:04:21,157 --> 01:04:23,023
- Ssshht, all is well.

781
01:04:24,492 --> 01:04:26,695
You have done god's
work this day Molly

782
01:04:26,697 --> 01:04:28,630
and he is most pleased.

783
01:04:31,300 --> 01:04:33,434
But you have seen the evil.

784
01:04:35,338 --> 01:04:36,771
And it blinds you.

785
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,143
Free yourself.

786
01:05:21,918 --> 01:05:22,983
- Follow me.

787
01:05:31,527 --> 01:05:32,626
- Richard?

788
01:05:34,063 --> 01:05:38,333
We can take it from here if
you don't wanna go any further.

789
01:05:39,534 --> 01:05:40,635
- No, I...

790
01:05:44,306 --> 01:05:46,440
I need to do this.

791
01:05:46,443 --> 01:05:47,541
- Okay.

792
01:05:59,387 --> 01:06:00,521
- That smell.

793
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:02,958
Sarah?

794
01:06:11,233 --> 01:06:14,568
- Here, rub some of
this under your nose.

795
01:06:19,909 --> 01:06:22,177
- I guess you guys
are used to this?

796
01:06:22,179 --> 01:06:23,577
- Strong odors are
one of the top tells

797
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:28,416
of demonic presence but uh,
yeah this is really bad.

798
01:06:28,418 --> 01:06:29,951
Usually it emanates
from a subterranean area

799
01:06:29,952 --> 01:06:32,853
like a basement or a crawlspace
underneath the house.

800
01:06:32,856 --> 01:06:34,655
- Yeah, yeah, that's
where I first smelled it,

801
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:35,690
it was in the cellar.

802
01:06:35,692 --> 01:06:38,492
- Let's start with the cellar.

803
01:07:20,902 --> 01:07:22,704
- Oh my god, Molly?

804
01:07:31,079 --> 01:07:32,146
- Not Sarah?

805
01:07:33,882 --> 01:07:35,282
- Our neighbor.

806
01:07:39,521 --> 01:07:41,021
- What are you doing?

807
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:42,489
- I'm calling the police.

808
01:07:42,492 --> 01:07:43,657
- Put your phone away.

809
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:44,726
- Why?

810
01:07:44,728 --> 01:07:47,262
- There is a strong
evil in this place,

811
01:07:47,264 --> 01:07:48,596
and we won't expose
anyone else until we know

812
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:50,597
what we're doing with.

813
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:53,434
- Readings have spiked
across the board.

814
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:57,672
Father help me!

815
01:07:59,375 --> 01:08:00,375
Faith!

816
01:08:01,277 --> 01:08:02,277
- Away!

817
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:07,648
Away!

818
01:08:10,686 --> 01:08:12,253
- Leave this place.

819
01:08:15,458 --> 01:08:16,390
- Sarah?

820
01:08:16,393 --> 01:08:18,626
- Stay right there Richard.

821
01:08:20,128 --> 01:08:22,262
Who are you demon?

822
01:08:22,265 --> 01:08:24,631
I command you to name yourself.

823
01:08:24,634 --> 01:08:27,034
- It asks questions.

824
01:08:27,037 --> 01:08:31,639
Stupid questions as it
knows my name, it fears me.

825
01:08:31,640 --> 01:08:33,307
- I've faced your kind before.

826
01:08:33,310 --> 01:08:35,710
- Faced the small.

827
01:08:35,712 --> 01:08:37,444
The weak, but not me.

828
01:08:56,564 --> 01:08:59,567
- You didn't know
she was pregnant?

829
01:08:59,569 --> 01:09:02,470
- That's because
yesterday she wasn't.

830
01:09:02,471 --> 01:09:04,037
- Who's the father?

831
01:09:08,176 --> 01:09:09,577
- It's not possible.

832
01:09:09,578 --> 01:09:11,679
- What's not possible?

833
01:09:14,015 --> 01:09:15,582
- Last night I...

834
01:09:17,752 --> 01:09:20,654
I...

835
01:09:26,595 --> 01:09:28,695
There was this woman and...

836
01:09:33,269 --> 01:09:35,235
And I had sex with her.

837
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:42,676
And I finished and...

838
01:09:47,315 --> 01:09:49,583
I saw her, I saw her face.

839
01:09:56,024 --> 01:09:58,393
It was Sarah, it was Sarah!

840
01:10:09,837 --> 01:10:11,538
What do we do now?

841
01:10:15,844 --> 01:10:18,212
Maybe we should pray again.

842
01:10:22,185 --> 01:10:25,052
- I've helped a lot
of people Richard.

843
01:10:25,055 --> 01:10:26,988
But they all had faith.

844
01:10:28,157 --> 01:10:30,057
And as hard as it is,
now is not the time

845
01:10:30,060 --> 01:10:32,359
to be losing yours.

846
01:10:32,362 --> 01:10:35,329
- Well I never really had it
much in abundance to begin with

847
01:10:35,332 --> 01:10:37,864
so that presents
somewhat of a problem.

848
01:10:37,867 --> 01:10:39,766
- Then find it, and
be quick about it too

849
01:10:39,769 --> 01:10:41,836
if you wanna help Sarah.

850
01:10:44,038 --> 01:10:45,573
- Help her?

851
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:46,574
- Yes.

852
01:10:47,509 --> 01:10:48,643
- She's sick.

853
01:10:50,712 --> 01:10:52,346
She, she seduced me.

854
01:10:55,516 --> 01:10:57,819
She murdered that poor woman.

855
01:10:59,887 --> 01:11:01,456
And god knows what else.

856
01:11:01,457 --> 01:11:03,123
- Whatever's happening
here, you can be sure it's

857
01:11:03,126 --> 01:11:05,525
not your sister's doing.

858
01:11:05,528 --> 01:11:09,863
She's under the control
of a very powerful demon.

859
01:11:09,865 --> 01:11:12,300
And you need to remember this.

860
01:11:13,202 --> 01:11:14,868
Understand?

861
01:11:14,871 --> 01:11:16,371
- Whatever you say.

862
01:11:39,395 --> 01:11:40,962
- Dear god.

863
01:11:53,007 --> 01:11:54,908
She's coming around.

864
01:12:21,103 --> 01:12:22,804
- It will release me!

865
01:12:22,805 --> 01:12:25,305
- Our father who art in
heaven, hallowed be thy name.

866
01:12:29,779 --> 01:12:32,913
- Mother who kills
her own is now mine.

867
01:12:34,315 --> 01:12:37,452
The little one,
sick, weak, pathetic.

868
01:12:39,887 --> 01:12:44,125
We took her soul and
now we take this one.

869
01:12:44,127 --> 01:12:45,626
- Elizabeth.

870
01:12:45,627 --> 01:12:48,829
- Don't listen to it, telling
lies is in its nature.

871
01:12:48,832 --> 01:12:52,899
- Yes, but this one knows
he does not hear lies.

872
01:12:55,002 --> 01:12:58,072
He knows this time
we speak the truth.

873
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:01,641
- You killed Elizabeth.

874
01:13:04,180 --> 01:13:06,480
- I denounce you.

875
01:13:08,585 --> 01:13:12,420
- Does this one think his
little tricks will work on us?

876
01:13:12,421 --> 01:13:14,221
- Your name is belial.

877
01:13:15,557 --> 01:13:17,891
You are a servant of
the father of lies.

878
01:13:17,894 --> 01:13:20,895
I know you demon,
and I rebuke you.

879
01:13:31,506 --> 01:13:34,108
Our father, who art in heaven.

880
01:13:34,109 --> 01:13:36,778
- What grows inside
is far stronger

881
01:13:36,779 --> 01:13:39,947
than little man and
his pitiful god.

882
01:13:39,948 --> 01:13:41,015
- Thy kingdom come...

883
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:46,020
- deny us? Weak mortal!

884
01:14:08,877 --> 01:14:09,877
- Hey.

885
01:14:25,159 --> 01:14:27,328
- Whatever that thing is.

886
01:14:33,435 --> 01:14:35,069
It's right isn't it?

887
01:14:36,104 --> 01:14:37,904
- How's that?

888
01:14:37,907 --> 01:14:42,143
- You never faced
anything like it before.

889
01:14:42,145 --> 01:14:43,145
Have you?

890
01:14:46,448 --> 01:14:47,448
- No.

891
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:54,755
- So how are you gonna stop it?

892
01:14:54,756 --> 01:14:57,859
- Only god is perfect Richard.

893
01:14:57,860 --> 01:14:59,426
And every other creature
in this world and the next

894
01:14:59,429 --> 01:15:00,595
is imperfect.

895
01:15:02,497 --> 01:15:06,000
And everything imperfect
has a weakness.

896
01:15:07,135 --> 01:15:11,104
All we need to do is
figure out what that is.

897
01:15:16,612 --> 01:15:20,847
- Well, it's about as
good as we're gonna do.

898
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:22,283
- Is she still out?

899
01:15:22,284 --> 01:15:24,685
- She should be, I pumped
with her enough juice

900
01:15:24,686 --> 01:15:27,354
to put down a herd of elephants.

901
01:15:31,859 --> 01:15:35,162
Can I talk to you
alone for a moment?

902
01:15:35,163 --> 01:15:36,163
- Yeah.

903
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:47,140
What is it?

904
01:15:49,310 --> 01:15:51,112
- I'm outta tranqs.

905
01:15:52,346 --> 01:15:56,117
So I don't know what the plan
is when she wakes up again.

906
01:15:57,552 --> 01:15:59,185
I really feel like this
time we bit off more than we

907
01:15:59,188 --> 01:16:03,658
can handle, and then her condition
only complicates things.

908
01:16:03,659 --> 01:16:05,859
- Now which condition
would that be?

909
01:16:05,862 --> 01:16:08,595
The fact that she's
possessed or pregnant.

910
01:16:08,597 --> 01:16:10,530
- If what Richard told you
is true than this thing

911
01:16:10,533 --> 01:16:12,699
inside her is less
than a day old.

912
01:16:12,702 --> 01:16:15,101
- And that would be a miracle.

913
01:16:15,104 --> 01:16:19,105
- A miracle, that we
can not allow to happen.

914
01:16:19,108 --> 01:16:20,041
- What are you saying?

915
01:16:20,042 --> 01:16:23,411
- I'm saying we need to stop it.

916
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:26,079
- By saying stop, you mean kill?

917
01:16:28,750 --> 01:16:30,051
- Yes.

918
01:16:30,052 --> 01:16:33,520
- If you kill her, you
kill an unborn child.

919
01:16:33,523 --> 01:16:34,654
- We need to.

920
01:16:36,757 --> 01:16:39,926
- I don't wanna hear
anymore of this.

921
01:16:48,103 --> 01:16:49,103
- Richard.

922
01:17:09,890 --> 01:17:12,393
Richard don't let them hurt me.

923
01:17:12,395 --> 01:17:13,761
- They're here to help you.

924
01:17:13,762 --> 01:17:16,296
- No, they're going to kill me.

925
01:17:17,231 --> 01:17:18,332
- No!

926
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,103
- Richard, are you okay?

927
01:17:22,104 --> 01:17:23,237
- Stay away.

928
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:24,505
- I'm trying to help you.

929
01:17:24,506 --> 01:17:26,640
- No you're not.

930
01:17:26,643 --> 01:17:28,908
No, you wanna kill her.

931
01:17:28,911 --> 01:17:30,243
- Hey, Richard.

932
01:17:30,246 --> 01:17:31,746
- Fuck you get out!

933
01:17:32,814 --> 01:17:35,349
- Richard I'm
trying to help her.

934
01:17:35,350 --> 01:17:38,019
- Yeah, but now that
you realize you can't,

935
01:17:38,020 --> 01:17:40,020
you're gonna kill her,
she can read your mind,

936
01:17:40,023 --> 01:17:42,288
she talks to me, she's
begging me to stop you.

937
01:17:42,291 --> 01:17:46,092
- Richard, you know this
creature can take on many forms.

938
01:17:46,095 --> 01:17:48,863
And if you're hearing Sarah
now, you must know it's a demon

939
01:17:48,864 --> 01:17:52,533
trying to deceive you,
you have to trust me.

940
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:55,603
Come here, I'll show you.

941
01:18:11,153 --> 01:18:13,621
Go ahead, ask it a question.

942
01:18:15,323 --> 01:18:17,625
Something only Sarah would know.

943
01:18:17,627 --> 01:18:20,795
Believe me it won't
be able to answer it.

944
01:18:20,796 --> 01:18:22,195
- Sarah?

945
01:18:22,198 --> 01:18:26,132
- The little man tells the
truth, she is gone, gone!

946
01:18:26,135 --> 01:18:30,237
- Away with you, servant
of lies, child of evil!

947
01:18:30,238 --> 01:18:32,038
God's word holds the power!

948
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:34,475
- Does it want to see my power?

949
01:18:35,377 --> 01:18:37,211
- God, Sarah.

950
01:18:43,251 --> 01:18:45,152
- I cast you out!

951
01:18:45,154 --> 01:18:47,320
I believe in the true god,

952
01:18:47,323 --> 01:18:49,523
creator of heaven and earth!

953
01:18:49,524 --> 01:18:50,890
I cast you out!

954
01:18:53,028 --> 01:18:55,429
For he is the one true god!

955
01:18:56,832 --> 01:18:59,265
We.

956
01:18:59,268 --> 01:19:00,634
I cast you out!

957
01:19:01,737 --> 01:19:04,971
I cast you out in
the name of the lord!

958
01:19:06,207 --> 01:19:08,708
- Oh my god it's happening!

959
01:19:08,711 --> 01:19:10,277
- In the name of...

960
01:19:16,217 --> 01:19:18,319
- We need to stop this now.

961
01:19:31,634 --> 01:19:34,268
- You shall not stop us!

962
01:19:34,270 --> 01:19:37,270
- Richard, open
the door Richard!

963
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:48,215
- The whole place is
coming down around us!

964
01:20:16,944 --> 01:20:19,313
- Okay father just to clarify
you're not under arrest,

965
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:22,649
so you can stop this
interview at any time.

966
01:20:22,652 --> 01:20:24,518
And you've been advised
that you have the right

967
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:27,121
to an attorney, so if you
continue talking to me

968
01:20:27,122 --> 01:20:30,490
anything you say can
be used against you.

969
01:20:34,429 --> 01:20:37,497
Father, are you
willing to continue?

970
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:42,670
Okay.

971
01:20:44,206 --> 01:20:47,274
You want me to call
the archdiocese?

972
01:20:49,677 --> 01:20:53,613
- So, let's go through
this one more time.

973
01:20:53,615 --> 01:20:56,350
- There's nothing father
frank or I can tell you,

974
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:59,019
that isn't on that camera.

975
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:00,453
If you can find it.

976
01:21:00,456 --> 01:21:04,324
- Buried under 40
tons of rubble, yeah,

977
01:21:04,327 --> 01:21:06,193
I'm not gonna get my hopes up.

978
01:21:06,194 --> 01:21:09,296
- You need to look at this
from my point of view okay.

979
01:21:09,297 --> 01:21:12,298
Now as much as I hate putting
the screws to a priest,

980
01:21:12,301 --> 01:21:15,603
there's a lot here
that needs explaining.

981
01:21:17,972 --> 01:21:19,239
- I felt them.

982
01:21:20,074 --> 01:21:21,442
- You felt who?

983
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:27,448
- They say the good will
inevitably conquer evil.

984
01:21:28,550 --> 01:21:30,885
This time at least
they're wrong.

985
01:21:30,886 --> 01:21:35,154
- Please could we try to
be a little less cryptic?

986
01:21:38,092 --> 01:21:41,694
- Do you believe
in god, detective?

987
01:21:41,697 --> 01:21:42,595
- Of course.

988
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:44,664
- How about the evil one?

989
01:21:45,734 --> 01:21:48,135
Well do you believe in him?

990
01:21:49,604 --> 01:21:51,939
- Father what I believe
in is what I can see

991
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:54,942
and what I can smell and
what I've got right now,

992
01:21:54,944 --> 01:21:59,345
is I've got a collapsed
house, and a mutilated corpse,

993
01:21:59,347 --> 01:22:03,350
and that looks and smells real
bad for you and your friend.

994
01:22:03,351 --> 01:22:06,220
- Molly Hanning was her name.

995
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:09,355
Search and rescue found
her body in the rubble.

996
01:22:09,358 --> 01:22:12,091
She was cut up real bad.

997
01:22:12,094 --> 01:22:14,662
- What about Richard and Sarah?

998
01:22:16,363 --> 01:22:18,032
What about the baby?

999
01:22:18,033 --> 01:22:20,967
- No we only found the
one, the neighbor lady,

1000
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:22,536
the Mrs. Hanning.

1001
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:27,140
- And you didn't find a baby?

1002
01:22:30,979 --> 01:22:33,479
For all our sakes detective,

1003
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:37,784
I pray that that was an
oversight on your part.

1004
01:22:37,787 --> 01:22:39,552
- What do you mean?

1005
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:42,422
- If it survived...

1006
01:22:42,425 --> 01:22:45,559
- survived, what are
you talking about?

1007
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:50,296
- If the child was born,

1008
01:22:51,966 --> 01:22:55,636
if that monstrosity has
entered our world...

1009
01:23:00,274 --> 01:23:01,507
God help us all.

1010
01:23:15,256 --> 01:23:17,157
- Just wanted to let
you know that the priest

1011
01:23:17,158 --> 01:23:19,993
and his friend are
gone, for now at least

1012
01:23:19,996 --> 01:23:24,297
you'll be safe from them,
I'll see you later Richard.

1013
01:23:24,300 --> 01:23:28,301
Protect your family
and protect the child.

1014
01:23:28,304 --> 01:23:30,770
Many will come to hurt
him, but you and Sarah

1015
01:23:30,773 --> 01:23:35,009
are strong and that's
why you were chosen.
