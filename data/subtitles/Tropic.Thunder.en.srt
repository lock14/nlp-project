Are we gonna blow this tree line or what?

174
00:12:40,892 --> 00:12:42,520
Tuk Tuk and Kim got the blue balls here.

175
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,855
I'm gonna let them squirt if we're a go!

176
00:12:43,895 --> 00:12:46,191
- Play it through. Still rolling!
- Dieter, can he hear me?

177
00:12:46,231 --> 00:12:48,860
That's C-4, dipshit. Put that back.
I said a detonator.

178
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:51,329
I need some dudes up here who
speak American, God damn it!

179
00:12:51,369 --> 00:12:52,897
He's making a fucking sweater back here.

180
00:12:52,937 --> 00:12:55,333
I'm trying to put Tiger
Balm on this jungle's nuts.

181
00:12:55,373 --> 00:12:56,601
Everyone, please shut up.

182
00:12:56,641 --> 00:12:58,870
The jets are coming in.
We only have one chance at this!

183
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,309
And go!

184
00:13:00,411 --> 00:13:02,919
Let's do it. You feel it?
You feel me?

185
00:13:03,715 --> 00:13:06,081
- You are my…
- I am your brother.

186
00:13:06,551 --> 00:13:08,416
We've seen it all, man.

187
00:13:09,154 --> 00:13:10,215
I'm sorry, Damien?

188
00:13:10,255 --> 00:13:11,575
Are you seeing that?

189
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:15,682
The little froggy on the boom mike?
It's right in my eyeline.

190
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,655
Donny! What's up, man?

191
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:19,398
It's been there the whole show.

192
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,525
Yeah, well it's right in my face,

193
00:13:20,565 --> 00:13:21,626
I'm staring at a frog, I'm trying to feel…

194
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,295
It's always the yellow frog that
brings them black frog on Fridays, man.

195
00:13:24,335 --> 00:13:26,097
Hell, no, I didn't pee on that girl.

196
00:13:26,137 --> 00:13:28,310
No, I didn't pee on her,
listen, listen, listen, listen. No, no.

197
00:13:28,339 --> 00:13:30,935
The story is this. She was in the way
when I was peeing, she walked past.

198
00:13:30,975 --> 00:13:33,341
What the fuck is going on here?

199
00:13:33,444 --> 00:13:35,688
On three, baby. One, two, breathe.

200
00:13:35,713 --> 00:13:38,309
Look, do me a favor. I don't want to do
a countdown before I do the scene.

201
00:13:38,349 --> 00:13:39,477
- No countdown?
- No countdown.

202
00:13:39,517 --> 00:13:40,779
- Okay.
- Can we just do it off of “Action”?

203
00:13:40,819 --> 00:13:42,377
Just… In your own time.

204
00:13:42,487 --> 00:13:44,349
- Good…
- I'm not a rocket ship, okay?

205
00:13:44,389 --> 00:13:46,084
- All right, dude.
- And action!

206
00:13:46,124 --> 00:13:49,120
Whatever floats your boat, baby.
Fuck! Don't die!

207
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,594
Erika, get me a VitaminWater!

208
00:13:51,696 --> 00:13:53,224
You know what it is, Damien? I'm sorry.

209
00:13:53,264 --> 00:13:57,729
Not to get into his thing, but if
I'm crying, should Osiris be crying, too?

210
00:13:57,769 --> 00:13:59,731
- No, it's everyone cry…
- We cutting or we crying?

211
00:13:59,771 --> 00:14:01,166
- No, no, no, we're crying!
- Just call it, man!

212
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:03,401
- Kirk, you can cry. Tugg, you can cry.
- Thanks!

213
00:14:03,441 --> 00:14:05,236
- Everybody cry…
- You know what?

214
00:14:05,276 --> 00:14:07,305
- You see how agitated he is now?
- I know.

215
00:14:07,345 --> 00:14:10,141
- Let's make lemonade. Let's go to work.
- Okay. Still rolling!

216
00:14:10,181 --> 00:14:12,911
<i>This is Falcon One. We have the ridge
in sight, approximately two miles out.</i>

217
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:15,280
Dieter, these jets are about
to crest this ridge line.

218
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,315
They got about 200 pounds
of shit your pants.

219
00:14:17,355 --> 00:14:19,731
I need to know if we're ready to go.

220
00:14:21,159 --> 00:14:23,457
- You're my… You're my…
- I am your…

221
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:27,091
See, that's what I think it is, Damien.
I think it's the line.

222
00:14:27,131 --> 00:14:28,155
Yeah?

223
00:14:28,266 --> 00:14:30,195
I don't know if Four Leaf
would say that… Four Leaf?

224
00:14:30,235 --> 00:14:32,630
Were you crying when your hands blew up?

225
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,395
No. See, he didn't.
Yeah, I mean, just that's what…

226
00:14:34,405 --> 00:14:36,034
So now we in re-writes, right?

227
00:14:36,074 --> 00:14:37,268
- Where you going?
- Let's re-write it!

228
00:14:37,308 --> 00:14:39,537
Action Jackson can't cry.
That's what's going down.

229
00:14:39,577 --> 00:14:41,606
You know what, Kirk?
I'm ready to do the scene!

230
00:14:41,646 --> 00:14:45,276
What scene? The scene is
about emotionality. Where is it?

231
00:14:45,316 --> 00:14:46,978
- Now it's time to flip the script!
- Kirk…

232
00:14:47,018 --> 00:14:49,347
Be here till Chinese New Year
waiting for my man to cry.

233
00:14:49,387 --> 00:14:51,416
You're tangling me, you're
fucking tangling me.

234
00:14:51,456 --> 00:14:52,717
You're tangling me, God damn it!

235
00:14:52,757 --> 00:14:55,653
- Kirk, no!
- Stop tailgating me, you pasty tea bag!

236
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:57,922
I'm going potty.
You want to hold my dick?

237
00:14:57,962 --> 00:15:00,859
Shit! What are you fucking both doing,
Good Lord!

238
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:03,494
We're getting this in a wide shot, right?

239
00:15:03,534 --> 00:15:05,129
Of course we're getting
it in a fucking wide.

240
00:15:05,169 --> 00:15:06,264
What, do you think I'm a dick or something?

241
00:15:06,304 --> 00:15:07,896
Get that fucking food…

242
00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:09,439
Here they come!

243
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,983
- The planes are inbound!
- Shit! Shit!

244
00:15:13,044 --> 00:15:17,947
Shit, shit, cocksucker, bollocks.
Tropic tits!

245
00:15:18,049 --> 00:15:21,018
That's the signal! Go, go, go, go, go!

246
00:15:21,119 --> 00:15:23,178
Let's go freaking Tet here!

247
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:25,279
Goddamn shit-picking cock!

248
00:15:27,392 --> 00:15:28,984
That's my shit!

249
00:15:34,532 --> 00:15:37,467
Mother Nature just pissed her pantsuit!

250
00:15:45,343 --> 00:15:46,571
- Sweet.
- Oh, mama!

<i>Bungle in the jungle.</i>

252
00:15:51,749 --> 00:15:54,913
More bad news from the Vietnamese
set of <i>Tropic Thunder,</i>

253
00:15:54,953 --> 00:15:58,684
where a $4 million explosion
charred the Asian location

254
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,818
and the camera wasn't even rolling.

00:16:00,858 --> 00:16:03,588
<i>Financed by hotheaded mega-mogul

<i>just five days into shooting.
The reason?</i>

258
00:16:09,801 --> 00:16:12,797
Fingers are pointed at rookie
director Damien Cockburn,

259
00:16:12,837 --> 00:16:16,000
who, insiders say,
can't control a star-studded cast,

260
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,805
<i>including flatulent star of the popular</i>
Fatties <i>franchise, Jeff Portnoy.</i>

261

A lot of people are disrespecting me.</i>

262
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:27,278
<i>They say that the movie's
just about farts. It's about family,</i>

263

<i>Fresh from his most recent arrest

<i>Well, being an actor is no different</i>

Hey. You see
that <i>Access Hollywood</i> piece?

319
00:19:00,371 --> 00:19:03,367
Yeah, I did.
It was like pistol-whipping a blind kid.

I mean, I'm not gonna sugarcoat it,
Tugg. You are a huge star, all right?

328
00:19:22,326 --> 00:19:24,155

00:19:39,043 --> 00:19:40,492
<i>when you were a kid?
I mean, think of that.</i>

336
00:19:40,511 --> 00:19:44,277
Boom! End of story.
They hook up the TiVo yet?

337
00:19:44,382 --> 00:19:45,644
Good gosh.

338
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,645
- <i>What?</i>
- The TiVo, they hook it up?

339
00:19:47,685 --> 00:19:50,014
- <i>No. The guy didn't come.</i>
- What?

340
00:19:50,054 --> 00:19:52,648
For fuck's sake, that is unacceptable.

341
00:19:52,757 --> 00:19:54,719
They have digital cable,
but, I mean, it's okay.

342
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,054
No, no, no. Come on, man. It's not okay.

343
00:19:57,094 --> 00:19:59,221
<i>It is not okay, Tugg!</i>

344
00:19:59,330 --> 00:20:02,527
And you don't need to explain
to me why you need TiVo

345
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:06,503
or clean water, clean
sheets, food, shelter.

346
00:20:06,604 --> 00:20:09,767
<i>I mean, I fought for that in your contract.</i>

347
00:20:09,807 --> 00:20:11,936
How's the adoption thing coming, buddy?

348
00:20:11,976 --> 00:20:14,001
Not too great.

349
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:19,944
I feel like all the good ones are gone.

350
00:20:21,619 --> 00:20:23,981
Well, at least you get to choose yours.

351
00:20:24,021 --> 00:20:25,852
I'm stuck with mine.

352
00:20:27,758 --> 00:20:30,354
Tell you what, get back
to work, genius soldier.

353
00:20:30,394 --> 00:20:33,324
The Pecker's on a TiVo mission
for the Y-O-U.

354
00:20:33,364 --> 00:20:35,193
<i>Work on those tears, my man.</i>

355
00:20:35,233 --> 00:20:36,325
All right. Yeah.

356
00:20:36,434 --> 00:20:37,992
Say it for me one time.

357
00:20:38,102 --> 00:20:42,368
- You make me happy.
- Make me happy.

358
00:20:42,473 --> 00:20:44,936
- <i>I love you, buddy.</i>
- All right, bye.

359
00:20:44,976 --> 00:20:47,038
Crisis meeting?
What does that mean, exactly?

360
00:20:47,078 --> 00:20:48,806
I mean, are we in a crisis?

361
00:20:48,846 --> 00:20:50,441
He's the head of the studio.

362
00:20:50,481 --> 00:20:52,910
He's reaching out.
We're 10,000 miles away.

363
00:20:52,950 --> 00:20:54,111
He just wants a little face-time.

364
00:20:54,151 --> 00:20:56,814
I know, it's just you said
that he called it a crisis meeting. So…

365
00:20:56,854 --> 00:20:59,317
It's Les Grossman.
He throws these words around.

366
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:03,760
“Crisis,” “explosion,”
“not rolling,” “fired.”

367
00:21:03,861 --> 00:21:05,247
These are just words.

368
00:21:05,296 --> 00:21:07,389
Yeah! Yeah!

369
00:21:07,498 --> 00:21:10,861
Keep a secret? A camera truck
in London just plowed into Judi Dench.

370
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:12,108
Trust me, he's got bigger problems.

371
00:21:12,136 --> 00:21:14,665
<i>Look, he may be able to see
me, but I can't see him.</i>

372
00:21:14,705 --> 00:21:19,233
- Move! Move! Hello, Les! Hello!
- <i>Get your ass out of my…</i>

373
00:21:19,343 --> 00:21:20,861
- <i>Your feet were on my desk.</i>
- Can he see us?

374
00:21:20,878 --> 00:21:22,273
I don't know why we don't have…

375
00:21:22,313 --> 00:21:24,542
Get him a Diet Coke. Les! It's working!

376
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:27,144
Yeah, whatever you're doing right there.
Hello, Les!

377
00:21:27,184 --> 00:21:28,646
- Hello, Les!
- <i>Okay.</i>

378
00:21:28,686 --> 00:21:30,815
We got you loud and clear here, Les.

379
00:21:30,855 --> 00:21:34,552
<i>I see you. I see you. I see you.</i>

380
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:38,157
<i>Which one of you fuckfaces
is Damien Cockburn?</i>

381
00:21:38,796 --> 00:21:40,320
That's me, sir.

382
00:21:40,431 --> 00:21:44,028
It's good to finally meet you at last,
get some face-time.

383
00:21:44,068 --> 00:21:48,027
<i>And who here is the key grip?
You? You.</i>

384
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:53,869
<i>Hit that director in the
face, really fucking hard.</i>

385
00:22:00,384 --> 00:22:01,715
Sorry, man.

386
00:22:08,225 --> 00:22:11,126
<i>This is your fault, you limey fuck!</i>

387
00:22:11,228 --> 00:22:13,157
<i>You shit the money-bed, my friend.</i>

388
00:22:13,197 --> 00:22:15,722
- What?
- God damn it, Damien!

389
00:22:15,833 --> 00:22:18,996
With all due respect, Les Grossman did
not blow up the jungle.

390
00:22:19,036 --> 00:22:20,197
- What?
- <i>Fuck the jungle.</i>

391
00:22:20,237 --> 00:22:21,568
Exactly!

392
00:22:22,273 --> 00:22:23,740
Come on, man.

393
00:22:24,475 --> 00:22:27,205
Hey, Les, I understand if you're angry,

394
00:22:27,311 --> 00:22:29,373
but I am dealing with a
bunch of primadonnas!

395
00:22:29,413 --> 00:22:32,905
Clowns! Tugg Speedman, he can't cry!
He can't cry!

396
00:22:33,017 --> 00:22:35,479
<i>You know how you handle an actor?
They whine about anything,</i>

397
00:22:35,519 --> 00:22:38,883
<i>you pull down their pants
and you spank their ass.</i>

398
00:22:38,923 --> 00:22:41,118
- You spank that ass, Les.
- What?

399
00:22:41,225 --> 00:22:44,991
Spanking a child turns
him into a little snot.

400
00:22:45,863 --> 00:22:48,764
Fear makes him a man.

401
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:54,396
I know a place where a
man's worth is measured

402
00:22:54,505 --> 00:22:58,305
in the ears hanging from his dog tags.

403
00:22:58,409 --> 00:23:01,139
The real deep shit.

404
00:23:01,245 --> 00:23:02,707
You wanna make this movie right?

405
00:23:02,747 --> 00:23:03,908
You wanna make this movie right?

406
00:23:03,948 --> 00:23:07,440
That's where you take
your pansy-ass actors.

407
00:23:09,019 --> 00:23:10,884
<i>Who is this guy?</i>

408
00:23:10,988 --> 00:23:12,888
Les, that's Four Leaf.

409
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:16,289
Sergeant Four Leaf Tayback.
I wrote the book.

410
00:23:18,496 --> 00:23:22,626
<i>You're a great American.
This nation owes you a huge debt.</i>

411
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:25,900
<i>Now shut the fuck up and let me do my job!</i>

412
00:23:26,504 --> 00:23:28,032
- <i>Look, Cockburn.</i>
- Yes.

413
00:23:28,072 --> 00:23:32,169
<i>From now on, my fist is gonna
be so far up your shithole</i>

414
00:23:32,209 --> 00:23:33,637
<i>that every time you have a thought,</i>

415
00:23:33,677 --> 00:23:36,774
<i>it's gonna have to tiptoe
past my wedding ring.</i>

416
00:23:36,814 --> 00:23:40,411
<i>Take control of your actors,
or I will shut you down.</i>

417
00:23:40,451 --> 00:23:41,573
<i>Diet Coke!</i>

418
00:23:59,303 --> 00:24:01,498
One week down, two weeks behind,

419
00:24:01,605 --> 00:24:05,469
GI Joe can't cry, don't matter 'cause you
ain't got the camera turned on anyway.

420
00:24:05,509 --> 00:24:06,908
Let's party!

421
00:24:07,845 --> 00:24:09,807
Man, you better get your shit straight,

422
00:24:09,847 --> 00:24:13,544
or I'll be on the next NetJet out of here,
baby. You feel me?

423
00:24:13,584 --> 00:24:14,612
- You feel that?
- Yeah.

424
00:24:14,652 --> 00:24:17,424
Here comes another.
There we go. Now what?

425
00:24:17,555 --> 00:24:19,887
- Sandusky. Good.
- Hey, Mr Cockburn.

426
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:21,919
We need to have a cast meeting right now.

427
00:24:21,959 --> 00:24:23,320
- Right now? Awesome.
- Yes.

428
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,622
You actually care, don't you?

429
00:24:24,662 --> 00:24:27,324
Yeah, it's a huge deal
for me, are you kidding?

430
00:24:27,364 --> 00:24:29,393
I've spent the past two years of my life

431
00:24:29,433 --> 00:24:33,197
living off residuals from a anti-herpes
medication commercial.

432
00:24:33,237 --> 00:24:34,465
I know, you're the only one who auditioned,

433
00:24:34,505 --> 00:24:36,133
the only one who did
the two-week boot camp.

434
00:24:36,173 --> 00:24:37,834
Hey, hey, Alpa.

435
00:24:38,542 --> 00:24:41,071
I'm the director. He's…
I need to speak to my actor.

436
00:24:41,111 --> 00:24:42,406
All right, hold up. Chino?

437
00:24:42,446 --> 00:24:44,558
What? Hell, yo. What's up, baby?

438
00:24:45,149 --> 00:24:46,710
This about
the Booty Sweat cross-promotion?

439
00:24:46,750 --> 00:24:47,845
No, it's about the film.

440
00:24:47,885 --> 00:24:50,214
Oh, the film and Booty Sweat's
the same thing. Give him a shot.

441
00:24:50,254 --> 00:24:52,381
Hey, how you doing, Jeff?

442
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,948
- Who are you?
- That's awesome, man.

443
00:24:58,229 --> 00:25:02,962
Kevin. Kevin Sandusky. I play Brooklyn,
we've been working together.

444
00:25:03,067 --> 00:25:04,728
Oh, right, right. I like you.

445
00:25:04,768 --> 00:25:06,797
Man, it's a real honor to be here…

446
00:25:06,837 --> 00:25:08,199
I can tell it's gonna be a good experience.

447
00:25:08,239 --> 00:25:09,433
I'm really having a good time.

448
00:25:09,473 --> 00:25:11,168
Hey, can you help me out, man?
I'm looking for this guy.

449
00:25:11,208 --> 00:25:15,372
The grip with the bandana.
He's got a package for me.

450
00:25:15,846 --> 00:25:18,246
There he is, fucker. Dragon!

451
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,181
What the fuck? Oh, buddy!

452
00:25:21,318 --> 00:25:22,746
I'm gonna go shoot a video, right?

453
00:25:22,786 --> 00:25:24,982
I'm gonna have V.C. Soldiers
in the video

454
00:25:25,022 --> 00:25:26,383
doing the noodle-legs, Damien.

455
00:25:26,423 --> 00:25:30,977
Hell, yeah, do it. V.C. Soldiers doing
the hip-hop bunny hop, Damien.

456
00:25:31,028 --> 00:25:32,756
It's good, I love it, great. But I need to…

457
00:25:32,796 --> 00:25:35,893
V.C. Soldiers doing the seizure, baby.
Hit it, baby.

458
00:25:35,933 --> 00:25:38,375
Hell yeah, get it. Get it, Cornbread.

459
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:40,930
Alpa!

460
00:25:41,038 --> 00:25:42,533
Yo, check it out. Donny on the phone.

461
00:25:42,573 --> 00:25:43,601
Hello? Yo, yo, Donny!

462
00:25:43,641 --> 00:25:47,205
Can we call him back?
I've got to have a cast meeting.

463
00:25:49,246 --> 00:25:51,642
<i>When we put aside our differences,</i>

464
00:25:51,682 --> 00:25:54,549
<i>we see we're kind of the same.</i>

465
00:25:55,452 --> 00:25:58,979
<i>When we put aside our differences, we see</i>

466
00:26:00,658 --> 00:26:02,638
<i>we're kind of the same.</i>

467
00:26:03,294 --> 00:26:05,091
<i>Let's be friends.</i>

468
00:26:05,396 --> 00:26:08,432
<i>I know we can do great things together.</i>

469
00:26:10,134 --> 00:26:14,094
<i>That's a quotation from
a children's book I co-wrote,</i>

470
00:26:14,672 --> 00:26:16,850
The Boy Everybody Was Jealous Of.

471
00:26:16,907 --> 00:26:18,702
<i>I think it pertains to the journey…</i>

472
00:26:18,742 --> 00:26:20,722
<i>Simple Jack</i> sucked ass!

473
00:26:21,145 --> 00:26:23,607
<i>All right, who said that? It's not funny.</i>

474
00:26:23,647 --> 00:26:26,485
<i>Whoever it is, it's not funny, okay?</i>

475
00:26:32,723 --> 00:26:35,419
When the herd loses its way,

476
00:26:35,526 --> 00:26:39,963
the shepherd must kill the
bull that leads them astray.

477
00:26:41,799 --> 00:26:45,064
- Four Leaf?
- Come on over. It's okay.

478
00:26:46,737 --> 00:26:48,227
- Sit down.
- Yes.

479
00:26:49,640 --> 00:26:54,737
- So, you don't like the hotel?
- Beds give me nightmares.

480
00:26:59,783 --> 00:27:04,982
I'm guessing right about now
you couldn't find a Dixie coonskin

481
00:27:05,089 --> 00:27:09,423
with an Ohio hooker holding your prick
and showing you the way.

482
00:27:16,233 --> 00:27:17,564
What?

483
00:27:17,801 --> 00:27:19,393
You're a riddle

484
00:27:20,904 --> 00:27:23,839
with no cheese to maze through.

485
00:27:25,743 --> 00:27:26,770
Don't you get it?

486
00:27:26,810 --> 00:27:30,608
No, I don't. I'm a cock of the mouse
or something. I don't know.

487
00:27:30,648 --> 00:27:34,584
I put my story in your limp Brit hands,

488
00:27:34,685 --> 00:27:38,121
and you are not going to fail me.

489
00:27:38,222 --> 00:27:41,885
You think I was just blowing
my own bagpipe in that meeting?

490
00:27:41,925 --> 00:27:45,759
You must put those boys in the shit.

491
00:27:45,863 --> 00:27:47,513
What? I don't understand.

492
00:27:47,531 --> 00:27:50,796
- You wanna make your movie or not?
- Yes, I do.

493
00:27:50,901 --> 00:27:54,465
All right, you get
some of those little video type cameras.

494
00:27:54,505 --> 00:27:58,202
We take them out there, and we put
them in the trees in different angles.

495
00:27:58,242 --> 00:28:01,575
Then you give me and that pyromaniac Cody

496
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:06,548
all the smoke bombs, charges,
explosives, detonators you got.

497
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:09,084
Then we take those boys up there,

498
00:28:09,186 --> 00:28:12,349
me and Cody, we could light
up that fucking jungle,

499
00:28:12,389 --> 00:28:15,386
so those lily-dick actors
would be shitting their pants

500
00:28:15,426 --> 00:28:17,488
and screaming for their mammies.

501
00:28:17,528 --> 00:28:21,290
They'd be begging for a body
bag if it means a ride home.

502
00:28:23,834 --> 00:28:25,358
I could do it.

503
00:28:26,136 --> 00:28:29,633
I could shoot the whole thing
guerrilla style. Gritty, dirty.

504
00:28:29,673 --> 00:28:33,070
Get them away from their helpers
and ass-licking assistants.

505
00:28:33,110 --> 00:28:34,271
Put them in the real shit.

506
00:28:34,311 --> 00:28:35,572
- Real shit.
- With real fear in their eyes!

507
00:28:35,612 --> 00:28:38,672
Real fear, real emotion!
Yes, Four Leaf, yes!

508
00:28:38,782 --> 00:28:40,875
- Yes! Yes!
- Yes! Yes!

509
00:28:40,984 --> 00:28:43,030
Take them off the fucking grid!

510
00:29:00,204 --> 00:29:02,968
You are no longer actors in a movie!

511
00:29:04,074 --> 00:29:06,804
You are five men in a helicopter!

512
00:29:08,579 --> 00:29:10,342
With three other men!

513
00:29:15,986 --> 00:29:17,581
How long are we gonna be gone, anyways?

514
00:29:17,621 --> 00:29:21,682
'Cause I left most of my
vitamins back at the hotel.

515
00:29:21,792 --> 00:29:25,158
- Save your breath, maggots!
- That's right, maggots!

516
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:37,702
M&M?

517
00:29:39,610 --> 00:29:40,907
M&M?

518
00:30:00,697 --> 00:30:02,793
Go, go, go! Get out of the chopper!

519
00:30:02,833 --> 00:30:04,628
Go, go, go! Get out of the chopper!

520
00:30:04,668 --> 00:30:07,898
Move it, maggots, move!
Move, grunts, move your ass!

521
00:30:07,938 --> 00:30:10,236
Get out, you wriggly worms!

522
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:12,808
- It's up too high!
- Move, move, move!

523
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,009
See you in hell!

524
00:30:29,526 --> 00:30:33,724
This is bullshit!
I gotta at least call my fucking assistant.

525
00:30:34,998 --> 00:30:37,728
Fucking! Jesus! Dude!

526
00:30:39,203 --> 00:30:41,498
You're sitting on a nest
of hostile enemy V.C.

527
00:30:41,538 --> 00:30:44,974
Congratulations, Fats.
You just got us all killed.

528
00:30:45,976 --> 00:30:49,606
Anybody else care to give
away our position to Charlie?

529
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,443
Cell phones!

530
00:30:51,548 --> 00:30:53,015
What the hell, Damien?

531
00:30:53,116 --> 00:30:56,880
Weren't no cell phones in '69, man.
I'm head-to-toe legitimate.

532
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,321
Gentlemen, I've got good news and bad news.

533
00:31:00,424 --> 00:31:03,988
The studio wants to shut us down.
That's the bad news.

534
00:31:04,061 --> 00:31:06,359
And the good news.

535
00:31:06,463 --> 00:31:09,426
If you wanna save this movie,
you will become a unit.

536
00:31:09,466 --> 00:31:13,232
Your objective is to head north
to the D'ang Kwook River

537
00:31:13,337 --> 00:31:14,898
and liberate the POW camp,

538
00:31:14,938 --> 00:31:18,304
at which point Four Leaf
will get himself captured,

539
00:31:18,308 --> 00:31:20,170
at which point you will rescue him,

540
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:23,577
at which point we will chopper you home!

541
00:31:24,781 --> 00:31:25,873
Damn.

542
00:31:25,983 --> 00:31:27,845
Four Leaf, since you're the staff sergeant,

543
00:31:27,885 --> 00:31:30,347
there's the map, this is the scene list.

544
00:31:30,387 --> 00:31:32,514
Think you can handle it?

545
00:31:32,623 --> 00:31:36,821
We have rigged this entire
valley of death with hidden cameras.

546
00:31:38,295 --> 00:31:41,992
And I will be shooting as well,
from unseen vantage points,

547
00:31:42,032 --> 00:31:45,627
so that every glorious
moment is captured on film.

548
00:31:46,904 --> 00:31:50,067
And believe me, gentlemen,
it will be glorious.

549
00:31:50,173 --> 00:31:52,769
If it looks real, chances
are it probably is.

550
00:31:52,809 --> 00:31:54,401
You wanted to be actors.

551
00:31:54,511 --> 00:31:57,174
You wanted to occupy the
skin of another human being.

552
00:31:57,214 --> 00:32:00,277
Well, get ready to occupy the skin
of a terrified U.S. Infantry grunt,

553
00:32:00,317 --> 00:32:04,083
surrounded by death,
crawling up Satan's bottom.

554
00:32:05,122 --> 00:32:09,887
There'll be ambushes, enemy fire,
your own little personal slice of 'Nam.

555
00:32:09,927 --> 00:32:14,523
This radio goes to the chopper
and the chopper only.

556
00:32:14,631 --> 00:32:19,068
The chopper is God, and I
am Jesus Christ, his son.

557
00:32:19,169 --> 00:32:21,865
You are my chosen disciples.

558
00:32:21,972 --> 00:32:25,068
And no one gets to go home
till we get the shots.

559
00:32:25,108 --> 00:32:28,134
Put on your war faces, gentlemen.

560
00:32:28,245 --> 00:32:32,944
Now, let's go and make the
greatest war movie ever!

561
00:32:33,050 --> 00:32:35,382
- Yeah!
- All right!

562
00:32:54,137 --> 00:32:55,195
Yeah!

563
00:33:00,644 --> 00:33:01,702
Yeah!

564
00:33:14,257 --> 00:33:16,157
Not bad, Cockburn!

565
00:33:17,995 --> 00:33:19,189
Not bad.

566
00:33:20,897 --> 00:33:22,489
Wherever you are!

567
00:33:24,501 --> 00:33:27,867
Wherever he is?
Looks like he's all over the place.

568
00:33:29,373 --> 00:33:31,273
Here we go.

569
00:33:31,375 --> 00:33:33,400
Must be an old French mine.

570
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:38,394
It's a remnant from colonial Indo-China.
This jungle must be full of them.

571
00:33:39,049 --> 00:33:42,507
Don't you get it?
He's messing with our heads.

572
00:33:42,619 --> 00:33:44,715
That's what all that playing
God stuff was about.

573
00:33:44,755 --> 00:33:47,384
He's trying to get us to
act good, save the movie.

574
00:33:47,424 --> 00:33:50,526
He ain't playing God.
He's being judged by him.

575
00:33:54,464 --> 00:33:57,302
That's our objective.
Complete the mission.

576
00:34:03,373 --> 00:34:06,336
No offense, Kirk, I know you're
the big fancy actor here,

577
00:34:06,376 --> 00:34:10,340
but I've done a lot more effects-driven
event films than you. Okay?

578
00:34:10,380 --> 00:34:11,832
And I think I can spot

579
00:34:13,884 --> 00:34:15,479
a prop head when I see one.

580
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:17,009
Oh, Jesus.

581
00:34:18,221 --> 00:34:21,713
It's corn syrup, guys.
Corn syrup and latex.

582
00:34:24,928 --> 00:34:28,056
Warm, blood-flavored corn syrup.

583
00:34:28,165 --> 00:34:29,291
Oh, God.

584
00:34:29,933 --> 00:34:33,130
Smoke and mirrors, guys.
Welcome to the movie factory.

585
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:34,820
Oldest trick in the book.

586
00:34:36,373 --> 00:34:37,693
He getting down now.

587
00:34:37,774 --> 00:34:39,139
Oh, my God!

588
00:34:41,945 --> 00:34:44,004
Whoa, look at me!

589
00:34:44,114 --> 00:34:45,642
You're going to get the shots,

590
00:34:45,682 --> 00:34:48,745
and I'm going to make sure
because I'm the director.

591
00:34:48,785 --> 00:34:50,912
I'm from London. I direct plays.

592
00:34:51,021 --> 00:34:54,047
Hey, Damien! We got our war faces on!

593
00:35:04,067 --> 00:35:05,762
Look, I'm Dave Beckham.

594
00:35:15,412 --> 00:35:17,874
So, we gotta light these
boys up today, huh?

595
00:35:17,914 --> 00:35:20,356
Blow some sense into these young men.

596
00:35:21,084 --> 00:35:24,047
Hey, I don't want to come
off as weird or anything,

597
00:35:24,087 --> 00:35:28,023
but I might be your biggest fan. Yeah.

598
00:35:29,392 --> 00:35:33,682
<i>Tropic Thunder.</i>
Kind of like my <i>Catcher in the Rye.</i>

599
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:36,426
Yeah, I've never been in
the military, per se,

600
00:35:36,466 --> 00:35:39,700
but I have lost an appendage
in the line of duty.

601
00:35:40,704 --> 00:35:43,608
<i>Driving Miss Daisy,</i> first studio gig.

602
00:35:43,707 --> 00:35:44,765
Yeah.

603
00:35:45,275 --> 00:35:48,138
It's a pretty cool sidearm you got there.
What is it?

604
00:35:48,178 --> 00:35:50,158
I don't know what it's called.

605
00:35:50,981 --> 00:35:55,714
I just know the sound it makes
when it takes a mars life.

606
00:35:58,855 --> 00:35:59,913
Okay.

607
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:01,785
Damien, we're go for explosion.

608
00:36:01,825 --> 00:36:04,688
Ready to kick the tires
and light the fires on your say-so.

609
00:36:04,728 --> 00:36:06,774
Damien, we're go for explosion.

610
00:36:07,597 --> 00:36:08,692
<i>Do you copy?</i>

611
00:36:08,732 --> 00:36:11,661
<i>I got an itchy trigger finger here,
and I'm ready to blow some shit up.</i>

612
00:36:11,701 --> 00:36:15,330
All right, you happy now?
Can we do the scene?

613
00:36:15,438 --> 00:36:19,002
Or do you need a formal invitation?
Come on, let's go!

614
00:36:19,876 --> 00:36:20,968
Here. Okay.

615
00:36:21,077 --> 00:36:24,377
“Scene 12, exterior, jungle
clearing, day, ambush.

616
00:36:28,818 --> 00:36:30,814
”Four Leaf notices movement in the brush.

617
00:36:30,854 --> 00:36:33,950
”A dozen guerrilla fighters
can be seen moving in the tree line.

618
00:36:33,990 --> 00:36:36,550
Somewhere a mine explodes.”
And you.

619
00:36:37,894 --> 00:36:39,990
“I got a bad feeling on this one.”

620
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:41,591
- Yeah.
- No, that's your line.

621
00:36:41,631 --> 00:36:44,561
- I got… Now?
- Yeah, but scared. Like, scared.

622
00:36:44,601 --> 00:36:47,397
- “I got a bad feeling on this one.”
- Dude, wait, like how?

623
00:36:47,437 --> 00:36:49,332
“I got a bad feeling on this one.”

624
00:36:49,372 --> 00:36:51,465
- Okay.
- Action. Go, come on.

625
00:37:00,483 --> 00:37:03,387
I got a bad feeling on
this one there, Fats.

626
00:37:04,688 --> 00:37:08,120
Our asses don't get fragged
in this bullshit valley,

627
00:37:08,191 --> 00:37:10,086
first thing I'm doing
is paying my two bucks

628
00:37:10,126 --> 00:37:11,821
so I can watch Brooklyn bust his cherry

629
00:37:11,861 --> 00:37:14,624
on a sweet little mama-san's
dinky dau poontang.

630
00:37:14,664 --> 00:37:17,627
Shit, Brooklyn be bagged and tagged
before he get any cooch.

631
00:37:17,667 --> 00:37:20,901
He die, he probably die a
coochless motherfucker.

632
00:37:21,004 --> 00:37:22,403
Zip it, Motown.

633
00:37:22,505 --> 00:37:24,134
Don't you worry, Brooklyn.

634
00:37:24,174 --> 00:37:27,210
You got a lot of days of
fucking ahead of you.

635
00:37:28,345 --> 00:37:29,937
Man, I'm thirsty.

636
00:37:31,047 --> 00:37:36,007
Might as well have some of this
Booty Sweat I got back in Danang.

637
00:37:36,886 --> 00:37:40,378
Yo, asshole! This motherfucker's dead!

638
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:42,352
Ain't no <i>Criss Angel Mindfreak,</i>

David Blaine trapdoor
horseshit jumping off here!

640
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:49,659
Hey! You wanna get on the train here,
or do you wanna ruin another take?

641
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:53,791
There ain't no goddamn takes,
ain't no goddamn motion picture!

642
00:37:54,004 --> 00:37:55,767
- You sure?
- Yeah.

643
00:37:55,872 --> 00:37:57,669
- Yeah?
- For certain, man.

644
00:37:57,774 --> 00:38:00,150
Then why are you still in character?

645
00:38:01,244 --> 00:38:03,686
I know, but I don't have to tell you.

646
00:38:04,347 --> 00:38:05,405
You don't know.

647
00:38:05,515 --> 00:38:09,277
Man, I don't drop character
till I done a DVD commentary.

648
00:38:11,221 --> 00:38:13,450
You happy now?
We're out of position for the effects!

649
00:38:13,490 --> 00:38:15,219
Get down, fool!

650
00:38:16,926 --> 00:38:20,226
Didn't anyone read the script?
This is the ambush!

651
00:38:21,231 --> 00:38:24,894
- This feels pretty real!
- Exactly! Let's use it.

652
00:38:35,512 --> 00:38:36,672
Yeah!

653
00:38:37,947 --> 00:38:39,312
Yeah!

654
00:38:41,918 --> 00:38:43,180
Eat lead!

655
00:38:45,155 --> 00:38:48,587
They're busting caps like a
motherfucker down there.

656
00:38:50,794 --> 00:38:52,956
This is FUBAR. I say we juice them.

657
00:38:52,996 --> 00:38:55,108
- What do you think?
- Juice them.

658
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,391
Fuck you, Charlie!

659
00:39:01,471 --> 00:39:02,938
Big-ass titties!

660
00:39:08,912 --> 00:39:10,539
Look at that, huh?

661
00:39:15,819 --> 00:39:17,013
And cut!

662
00:39:19,289 --> 00:39:21,184
That's the trailer right there.

663
00:39:21,224 --> 00:39:22,521
Yeah!

664
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:24,889
- What do we do now?
- Yeah.

665
00:39:24,994 --> 00:39:26,589
North. Man said to head north.

666
00:39:26,629 --> 00:39:30,026
- Did you see me shooting?
- That's how we do. Good work, baby.

667
00:39:30,066 --> 00:39:31,124
I believed it.

668
00:39:31,234 --> 00:39:32,422
D'ang Kwook River.

00:39:33,036 --> 00:39:34,497
I'm betting he's got more of these battles

670
00:39:34,537 --> 00:39:37,334
and Viet Congs rigged for us along the way.

671
00:39:37,374 --> 00:39:41,140
Sergeant Osiris, get your men.
Load and lock.

672
00:39:41,811 --> 00:39:43,574
Real, baby, I'm real.

673
00:39:44,647 --> 00:39:47,445
Let's go! We got a lot of klicks to cover!

674
00:39:48,585 --> 00:39:51,611
Hump it up, gentlemen!
Single formation.

675
00:39:51,721 --> 00:39:53,552
Don't dawdle now!

676
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,300
D-Rod, D-Rod, this is Puddingface.
How are we coming on that hotplate?

677
00:40:24,587 --> 00:40:27,951
Something's up.
I think we better drag ass back there.

678
00:40:27,991 --> 00:40:31,885
Make sure Damien ain't forgot
how to use his talkbox again.

679
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:41,404
Yeah, baby, come on. Just a little taste.

680
00:40:43,006 --> 00:40:45,201
- What are you doing, Jeff?
- Fucking… Nothing, man!

681
00:40:45,241 --> 00:40:48,638
- I'm eating jellybeans.
- Wow, I love jellybeans. Can I please…

682
00:40:48,678 --> 00:40:51,450
No, you can't have any fucking jellybeans.

683
00:40:51,514 --> 00:40:52,606
They're mine.

684
00:40:52,715 --> 00:40:53,943
You think you're the only one who gets sick

685
00:40:53,983 --> 00:40:55,745
when he doesn't have his jellybeans?

686
00:40:55,785 --> 00:40:57,237
Boundaries, man. Fuck.

687
00:41:17,106 --> 00:41:19,869
Hey. I didn't mean to
show you up back there.

688
00:41:19,909 --> 00:41:24,107
It's just, I feel like we really need
to set the example for the other guys.

689
00:41:24,147 --> 00:41:26,047
It's gonna be tough,

690
00:41:26,149 --> 00:41:29,911
but I think Damien's gonna get
some great shit out of us.

691
00:41:30,720 --> 00:41:32,515
Just wish I had a director
like this on <i>Jack.</i>

692
00:41:32,555 --> 00:41:36,219
On <i>Jack.</i> What? <i>Jack?</i>
What you talking about?

693
00:41:36,259 --> 00:41:38,305
- <i>Simple Jack.</i>
- Oh, yeah.

694
00:41:39,729 --> 00:41:43,026
<i>Simple Jack,</i> yeah.
You went all out on that one, huh?

695
00:41:43,066 --> 00:41:45,395
You did.
Really swung for the fences, huh?

696
00:41:45,435 --> 00:41:47,835
Thank you. Thanks. Yeah.

697
00:41:47,937 --> 00:41:50,907
Yeah, it was an intense
experience, you know.

698
00:41:51,541 --> 00:41:53,634
I just did the work.

699
00:41:53,743 --> 00:41:58,363
Watched a lot of retarded people.
Spent time with them. Observed them.

700
00:41:58,848 --> 00:42:01,077
Watched all the retarded stuff they did.

701
00:42:01,117 --> 00:42:02,946
Then again, I always found mere observation

702
00:42:02,986 --> 00:42:05,348
in and of itself is a tad rudimentary.

703
00:42:05,388 --> 00:42:08,518
Sometimes, we gotta dig deeper
to mine the true emotional pay dirt.

704
00:42:08,558 --> 00:42:12,956
Thus, we can diagram the source
of the pain and then live it, you know.

705
00:42:12,996 --> 00:42:15,124
Yeah, yeah, live it. Yeah, exactly.

706
00:42:15,164 --> 00:42:17,961
You know, there were times
when I was doing <i>Jack</i>

707
00:42:18,001 --> 00:42:20,469
that I actually felt retarded,

708
00:42:20,570 --> 00:42:21,998
- like really retarded.
- Oh, yeah.

709
00:42:22,038 --> 00:42:24,300
I mean, I brushed my teeth retarded,

710
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:26,202
- I rode the bus retarded.
- Damn.

711
00:42:26,242 --> 00:42:29,539
In a weird way, I had to
sort of just free myself up

712
00:42:29,579 --> 00:42:32,609
to believe that it was
okay to be stupid or dumb.

713
00:42:32,649 --> 00:42:34,207
- To be a moron.
- Yeah.

714
00:42:34,317 --> 00:42:37,089
- To be moronical.
- Exactly, to be a moron.

715
00:42:37,153 --> 00:42:38,518
- An imbecile.
- Yeah.

716
00:42:38,621 --> 00:42:41,551
Like the dumbest motherfucker
that ever lived.

717
00:42:41,591 --> 00:42:42,819
When I was playing the character.

718
00:42:42,859 --> 00:42:45,522
- When you was the character.
- Yeah, as Jack, definitely.

719
00:42:45,562 --> 00:42:47,757
Jack, stupid ass Jack.

720
00:42:47,864 --> 00:42:49,192
Trying to come back from that.

721
00:42:49,232 --> 00:42:53,390
In a weird way it was almost like
I had to sort of fool my mind

722
00:42:53,469 --> 00:42:56,438
into believing that it wasn't retarded,

723
00:42:56,539 --> 00:42:58,334
and by the end of the
whole thing, I was like,

724
00:42:58,374 --> 00:43:02,972
“Wait a minute, I flushed so much out,
how am I gonna jumpstart it up again?”

725
00:43:03,012 --> 00:43:05,071
- It's just like… Right?
- Yeah.

726
00:43:05,181 --> 00:43:08,011
You was farting in bathtubs
and laughing your ass off.

727
00:43:08,051 --> 00:43:09,916
Yeah.

728
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:12,382
But Simple Jack thought he was smart,

729
00:43:12,422 --> 00:43:13,802
or rather, didn't think he was retarded,

730
00:43:13,823 --> 00:43:16,753
so you can't afford to play
retarded, being a smart actor.

731
00:43:16,793 --> 00:43:19,355
Playing a guy who ain't
smart but thinks he is,

732
00:43:19,395 --> 00:43:21,022
- that's tricky.
- Tricky.

733
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:24,727
It's like working with mercury.
It's high science, man. It's an art form.

734
00:43:24,767 --> 00:43:26,792
- Yeah.
- You an artist.

735
00:43:26,903 --> 00:43:28,765
- That's what we do, right? Yeah.
- Yeah.

736
00:43:28,805 --> 00:43:30,133
Hats off for going there,

737
00:43:30,173 --> 00:43:33,737
especially knowing how the
Academy is about that shit.

738
00:43:36,613 --> 00:43:40,140
- About what?
- You're serious? You don't know?

739
00:43:42,352 --> 00:43:45,058
Everybody knows you never go full retard.

740
00:43:45,922 --> 00:43:48,100
- What do you mean?
- Check it out.

741
00:43:48,157 --> 00:43:52,322
Dustin Hoffman, <i>Rain Man,</i> looked
retarded, act retarded, not retarded.

742
00:43:52,362 --> 00:43:56,520
Count toothpicks, cheat at cards.
Autistic, sure. Not retarded.

743
00:43:57,333 --> 00:43:59,262
Then you got Tom Hanks, <i>Forrest Gump.</i>

744
00:43:59,302 --> 00:44:01,664
Slow, yes, retarded,
maybe, braces on his legs.

745
00:44:01,704 --> 00:44:04,667
But he charmed the pants off Nixon,
and he won a Ping-Pong competition.

746
00:44:04,707 --> 00:44:05,835
That ain't retarded.

747
00:44:05,875 --> 00:44:10,099
And he was a goddamn war hero.
You know any retarded war heroes?

748
00:44:11,748 --> 00:44:13,739
You went full retard, man.

749
00:44:15,284 --> 00:44:16,670
Never go full retard.

750
00:44:17,654 --> 00:44:21,284
You don't buy that?
Ask Sean Penn, 2001, <i>I Am Sam.</i>

751
00:44:21,324 --> 00:44:24,690
Remember? Went full retard?
Went home empty-handed.

752
00:44:34,470 --> 00:44:37,667
Oh, my God! Holy shit!

753
00:44:38,341 --> 00:44:41,037
Good job, turd. You killed the director.

754
00:44:41,144 --> 00:44:42,472
No, that's impossible, man.

755
00:44:42,512 --> 00:44:45,475
I rigged the whole tree
line, and this is here.

756
00:44:45,515 --> 00:44:47,110
- He must have missed his mark.
- Missed his mark?

757
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:48,470
Yeah, this isn't me.

758
00:44:48,484 --> 00:44:51,347
Come on, let's bag and tag the bastard
and get back to the hotel.

759
00:44:51,387 --> 00:44:54,150
- You're in a world of hurt, dumbo!
- We're in a world of hurt!

760
00:44:54,190 --> 00:44:56,452
- You're in trouble.
- This isn't just on me!

761
00:44:56,492 --> 00:44:58,788
- We're in a… We're together on this.
- Bullshit.

762
00:44:58,828 --> 00:45:00,356
You're just gonna run away.
You're gonna leave.

763
00:45:00,396 --> 00:45:02,125
What happened to, “No
man left behind,” okay?

764
00:45:02,165 --> 00:45:04,494
Just wait, just wait! Listen!
Listen, okay?

765
00:45:04,534 --> 00:45:07,330
- I don't wanna hear it.
- Let me just be real with you, all right?

766
00:45:07,370 --> 00:45:10,733
I almost blinded Jamie Lee
Curtis on <i>Freaky Friday,</i> okay?

767
00:45:10,773 --> 00:45:12,168
This shit will fucking ruin me!

768
00:45:12,208 --> 00:45:14,170
- Just get off me! You're pathetic.
- No, I'm not.

769
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:16,678
- Get off me!
- You are not going back!

770
00:45:20,049 --> 00:45:22,359
- What the fuck?
- Now wait a minute.

771
00:45:32,361 --> 00:45:35,124
So, what?
We're just supposed to keep walking?

772
00:45:35,164 --> 00:45:38,127
Try to stay in character.
Remember, we're on camera.

773
00:45:38,167 --> 00:45:39,195
This thing's too heavy.

774
00:45:39,235 --> 00:45:40,730
I want the rubber one that
the prop guy gave me.

775
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:43,034
Where's the fucking prop guy?

776
00:45:48,010 --> 00:45:50,604
How's it going with that map, chief?

777
00:45:50,713 --> 00:45:53,307
- Can I have a look at it?
- I got it.

778
00:45:53,416 --> 00:45:55,044
Yeah, Damien gave it to me, remember?

779
00:45:55,084 --> 00:45:56,646
Yeah, but he gave it to you for us.

780
00:45:56,686 --> 00:45:58,313
- Yeah.
- Okay.

781
00:45:58,421 --> 00:46:00,946
- I got it.
- You got it upside down.

782
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:02,057
Thank you.

783
00:46:02,191 --> 00:46:03,820
Letters go one way and the numbers another.

784
00:46:03,860 --> 00:46:05,488
Dude, I'm trying to… I got your back, man.

785
00:46:05,528 --> 00:46:07,356
- Well, I'm cool. All right, I'm cool.
- You are?

786
00:46:07,396 --> 00:46:09,261
Is your character dyslexic?

787
00:46:09,365 --> 00:46:11,160
- No, my character's not dyslexic.
- So you a can'tographer.

788
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,114
I'm tired, I want to go home.

789
00:46:13,136 --> 00:46:15,732
Why, so you can get back and make
<i>Fatties: Fart 20,</i> or some shit?

790
00:46:15,772 --> 00:46:18,768
It's <i>Fatties: Fart Two,</i> there's no… Hey,
you wish you had a <i>Fatties</i> franchise.

791
00:46:18,808 --> 00:46:20,103
- What?
- It's <i>Fatties: Fart Two.</i>

792
00:46:20,143 --> 00:46:21,437
- Yeah, you do.
- I don't want no <i>Fatties</i> franchise,

793
00:46:21,477 --> 00:46:23,940
- I got a diamond toilet.
- Your stupid-ass commercials.

794
00:46:23,980 --> 00:46:25,508
You're all fucked up, man, you look tired.

795
00:46:25,548 --> 00:46:26,743
You look like you bumped
your head or something,

796
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:28,678
so I came over to see
if you're fucking all right, that's all.

797
00:46:28,718 --> 00:46:30,822
- Yeah, why don't you get on point?
- I'm on point right here.

798
00:46:30,853 --> 00:46:31,948
My farts are fucking more beautiful than…

799
00:46:31,988 --> 00:46:34,548
You still got that shit upside down.

800
00:46:35,158 --> 00:46:36,619
The numbers help, man, the numbers…

801
00:46:36,659 --> 00:46:38,955
The letters go across the
top and then the numbers.

802
00:46:38,995 --> 00:46:40,623
- Want the map?
- Yeah, I want the fucking map.

803
00:46:40,663 --> 00:46:42,158
Well, you can't have it,
'cause Damien gave it me.

804
00:46:42,198 --> 00:46:45,428
You wish you had my farts,
my farts are fucking music.

805
00:46:45,468 --> 00:46:47,834
All right. That's enough.

806
00:46:49,305 --> 00:46:53,265
Everybody's obviously a little bushed
from all this humping.

807
00:46:53,643 --> 00:46:56,134
So take a chow break. Chow break!

808
00:46:57,947 --> 00:46:59,505
But stay alert.

809
00:47:00,082 --> 00:47:03,712
Remember, Charlie don't care
if you're on break or not.

810
00:47:08,658 --> 00:47:11,654
All right, that's lunch. Coming back
to the same scene afterwards,

811
00:47:11,694 --> 00:47:13,122
“Lost in the goddamn jungle.”

812
00:47:13,162 --> 00:47:14,482
Captain Simple Jack.

813
00:47:15,131 --> 00:47:15,893
Fuck you.

814
00:47:25,041 --> 00:47:26,599
I fucking hate movies.

815
00:47:28,945 --> 00:47:32,641
This is bullshit.
I don't wanna be in this shitty movie.

816
00:47:41,624 --> 00:47:44,388
No! That's my jellybeans! No!

817
00:47:44,493 --> 00:47:49,157
Kid, grab the bat! Please! Shit!

818
00:47:49,265 --> 00:47:53,159
- Yo, man, I got a Bust-A-Nut.
- You go to hell! There he is.

819
00:47:55,972 --> 00:47:58,907
God damn it! Okay. Where'd he go?

820
00:47:59,876 --> 00:48:04,034
You little piece of shit!
I'm gonna fucking rip your wings off!

821
00:48:04,280 --> 00:48:07,448
Sanducci. Hold up, man,
keep it on the down-low.

822
00:48:08,718 --> 00:48:11,013
I don't really gotta piss.
I'm trying to talk at you, man.

823
00:48:11,053 --> 00:48:12,680
Bait, I need bait.

824
00:48:13,823 --> 00:48:17,520
You went to boot camp, right?
You can read a map?

825
00:48:17,627 --> 00:48:18,855
Yeah, I think so.

826
00:48:18,961 --> 00:48:21,724
I know Speedman got everyone
convinced we out here

827
00:48:21,764 --> 00:48:25,628
making <i>Planet of the Apes</i> on YouTube
or some shit, but I don't buy it.

828
00:48:25,668 --> 00:48:28,902
You wanna step on a real landmine?
You wanna die?

829
00:48:28,938 --> 00:48:30,700
You wanna get shot by a real motherfucker?

830
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:33,903
- Keep looking ahead, man.
- No, of course not.

831
00:48:34,310 --> 00:48:36,471
Trying to get home, man.

832
00:48:36,579 --> 00:48:38,307
Got a big job coming up next year.

833
00:48:38,347 --> 00:48:39,780
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

834
00:48:39,882 --> 00:48:42,478
It's about Abe Lincoln and John Wilkes
Booth when they were both young.

835
00:48:42,518 --> 00:48:43,610
- Oh, wow!
- Yeah.

836
00:48:43,719 --> 00:48:46,282
- That's a classy picture.
- Dude, you kind of look like Abe.

837
00:48:46,322 --> 00:48:47,789
Slap a beard on you.

838
00:48:47,890 --> 00:48:49,986
- What's your fucking name?
- Really? It's Kevin.

839
00:48:50,026 --> 00:48:52,017
- Kevin Sandusky.
- Yeah.

840
00:48:52,695 --> 00:48:56,391
If I can put that map in your
hands, can I count on you?

841
00:48:56,666 --> 00:49:00,193
- Well, yeah, I guess you can.
- Dynamite. I'm out.

842
00:49:03,873 --> 00:49:06,369
That smelled just like
bologna for some reason.

843
00:49:06,409 --> 00:49:09,605
Is anyone gonna fucking help
me get this fucking thing?

844
00:49:09,645 --> 00:49:12,205
Why are they even out in the daytime?

845
00:49:14,417 --> 00:49:19,301
I'm gonna level with you, bro.
I don't need to pee. I need to talk to you.

846
00:49:25,094 --> 00:49:28,860
Lazarus is gonna torpedo the movie.

847
00:49:31,067 --> 00:49:32,862
He's way out on a limb with this character,

848
00:49:32,902 --> 00:49:35,212
and I think he's getting cold feet.

849
00:49:36,038 --> 00:49:38,901
And the men respect you,
'cause you went to boot camp

850
00:49:38,941 --> 00:49:40,568
and rehearsal.

851
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:44,184
- Can I count on you, Kyle.
- It's Kevin.

852
00:49:44,246 --> 00:49:45,304
Good.

853
00:49:46,882 --> 00:49:49,786
If you want
I could give the map a look-see.

854
00:49:49,852 --> 00:49:52,013
- I'll handle the map.
- Okay.

855
00:49:52,121 --> 00:49:55,418
You stick with the program,
we get this movie in the can,

856
00:49:55,458 --> 00:49:59,221
I'm thinking there could be
a Teen Choice Award in it for you.

857
00:49:59,261 --> 00:50:03,459
You have that potential.
They'll slime you, the whole deal.

858
00:50:03,566 --> 00:50:07,195
- Yeah, that's wicked.
- Good.

859
00:50:13,109 --> 00:50:15,419
There it is! Yeah, now you're dead!

860
00:50:16,379 --> 00:50:17,607
You O.D'ed!

861
00:50:19,181 --> 00:50:20,512
Hold up now, Jeff.

862
00:50:22,918 --> 00:50:24,317
Fucking hell!

863
00:50:25,955 --> 00:50:29,015
What the hell, Jeff? That's a bat, man!

864
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:31,593
I don't have any more jellybeans.

865
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,997
You land there!

866
00:50:54,917 --> 00:50:57,317
Wow. Look at these ruins.

867
00:50:59,488 --> 00:51:03,925
- Where the hell are we?
- D'ang Kwook River.

868
00:51:04,026 --> 00:51:06,455
That so? How do you know that?
How you sure?

869
00:51:06,495 --> 00:51:08,758
Only one way to find out, dude. Let's go.

870
00:51:08,798 --> 00:51:13,895
Yeah. I'm not feeling so good right now.
Seriously, my skin hurts!

871
00:51:14,003 --> 00:51:16,499
Enough from the peanut gallery!
Into the water, ladies!

872
00:51:16,539 --> 00:51:18,734
No, man. Let me take a look at that map
right quick.

873
00:51:18,774 --> 00:51:20,436
Why is everybody all obsessed with the map?

874
00:51:20,476 --> 00:51:22,571
'Cause we're tired of
being your trail donkeys!

875
00:51:22,611 --> 00:51:25,011
Acting like you some one-man GPS!

876
00:51:25,114 --> 00:51:28,982
God damn it! We lost!
We fucking super lost, man!

877
00:51:29,085 --> 00:51:31,280
Tell him, McClusky.
Tell him what time it is.

878
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,102
I don't believe you people.

879
00:51:34,623 --> 00:51:36,603
What do you mean “you people”?

880
00:51:38,994 --> 00:51:41,588
What do you mean, “you people”?

881
00:51:41,697 --> 00:51:43,688
I think what Tugg means is…

882
00:51:43,799 --> 00:51:45,227
No, look at his eyes, man.

883
00:51:45,267 --> 00:51:48,064
- ...you people, you actors. You people…
- Look at them beady, white devil eyes.

884
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:49,698
I gotta get back to the hotel, for real!

885
00:51:49,738 --> 00:51:51,706
- Hell, no!
- Silence!

886
00:51:52,741 --> 00:51:55,403
Chill! All right? Just chill it.

887
00:51:56,912 --> 00:52:00,109
Now, let's go get those Viet Congs.

888
00:52:00,950 --> 00:52:02,508
- “Viet Cong”!
- What?

889
00:52:03,018 --> 00:52:06,115
It's “Viet Cong.” There's no “S.”
It's already plural.

890
00:52:06,155 --> 00:52:08,003
You wouldn't say “Chineses.”

891
00:52:09,125 --> 00:52:11,620
All right, that's enough
of this insubordination!

892
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:14,458
If the machine breaks down, we break down.

893
00:52:14,563 --> 00:52:17,159
Hey, man, you know how in <i>Rambo I,</i>
he was big but a little puffy

894
00:52:17,199 --> 00:52:18,861
and then <i>Rambo II,</i> he got all shredded up?

895
00:52:18,901 --> 00:52:21,831
- Yeah.
- That's kind of how you look right now.

896
00:52:21,871 --> 00:52:23,499
- Yeah?
- Not <i>Rambo I</i> but <i>II.</i>

897
00:52:23,539 --> 00:52:25,334
- Really?
- Yeah, when he was cut up.

898
00:52:25,374 --> 00:52:27,803
I'm not that… I mean,
that's what I'm going for, but you know…

899
00:52:27,843 --> 00:52:30,606
Come on, dude. You more shredded
than a julienne salad, man.

900
00:52:30,646 --> 00:52:32,208
- Thanks.
- What's the secret, dude?

901
00:52:32,248 --> 00:52:33,676
- It's a diet. I'm just dieting.
- Really?

902
00:52:33,716 --> 00:52:36,779
'Cause I'm trying to come up a little,
but it's just… It's tough.

903
00:52:36,819 --> 00:52:38,380
- You look good.
- Any tips?

904
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:40,136
- What?
- Any tips, you got?

905
00:52:40,222 --> 00:52:41,417
There's, like, the pineapple…

906
00:52:41,457 --> 00:52:43,819
- Give me that goddamn map! Fuck you!
- Hey!

907
00:52:43,859 --> 00:52:45,451
- Hey!
- All right, now!

908
00:52:45,561 --> 00:52:48,057
What it is, Sikorski?
Tell us where we really at.

909
00:52:48,097 --> 00:52:50,193
That's fucking bullshit!
It's a chump move.

910
00:52:50,194 --> 00:52:52,702
We just getting a second opinion, doc.

911
00:52:53,964 --> 00:52:55,292
We're going the wrong way!

912
00:52:55,332 --> 00:52:56,494
- Damn!
- Son of a bitch.

913
00:52:56,534 --> 00:53:00,994
God! I think we were
supposed to be doing this,

914
00:53:01,105 --> 00:53:04,006
and instead we did this.

915
00:53:04,108 --> 00:53:07,737
Shit, shit, shit, shitty shit, shit!

916
00:53:07,845 --> 00:53:11,079
Think you can get us back
to that drop zone, boy?

917
00:53:11,315 --> 00:53:12,714
This is not cool!

918
00:53:15,419 --> 00:53:16,545
Maybe.

919
00:53:17,988 --> 00:53:19,478
This is insane!

920
00:53:20,758 --> 00:53:23,596
Are you really going to abandon this movie?

921
00:53:23,894 --> 00:53:26,089
We're supposed to be a unit!

922
00:53:26,197 --> 00:53:27,721
Suck my unit!

923
00:53:28,599 --> 00:53:30,396
All right, fine.

924
00:53:30,501 --> 00:53:35,404
- I'll finish it by myself.
- You go be all you can be, man.

925
00:53:35,506 --> 00:53:37,568
Tugg, you have no idea where you're going!

926
00:53:37,608 --> 00:53:39,405
Yes, I do!

927
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:44,038
I'm going to, “Exterior, rain forest, dusk.

928
00:53:44,148 --> 00:53:48,679
Smash cut to Four Leaf, who treks
alone through a frightening jungle.”

929
00:53:48,719 --> 00:53:50,653
Suck on that unit, Kirk!

930
00:54:04,235 --> 00:54:07,227
Come on, men. Let's get home.

931
00:54:45,409 --> 00:54:50,073
Hello, Mr Mantis. You're beautiful.

932
00:54:52,349 --> 00:54:54,345
Now, if you recall that whole hullabaloo

933
00:54:54,385 --> 00:54:56,180
where Hollywood was split into schisms,

934
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:59,683
some studios backing Blu-ray Disc,
others backing HD DVD.

935
00:54:59,723 --> 00:55:00,884
People thought it would come down to

936
00:55:00,924 --> 00:55:03,254
pixel rate or refresh rate,
and they're pretty much the same.

937
00:55:03,294 --> 00:55:07,122
What it came down to was a
combination of gamers and porn.

938
00:55:07,197 --> 00:55:08,993
Now, whichever format porno backs

939
00:55:09,033 --> 00:55:12,867
is usually the one that
becomes the most successful.

940
00:55:12,970 --> 00:55:16,033
But, you know, Sony,
every PlayStation 3 has a Blu-ray in it.

941
00:55:16,073 --> 00:55:18,317
You talking to me this whole time?

942
00:55:18,366 --> 00:55:19,918
I was talking to whoever
was listening to me.

943
00:55:19,943 --> 00:55:21,410
Jesus Christ, man!

944
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:41,889
Booty Sweat.

945
00:55:47,938 --> 00:55:49,337
Oh, God!

946
00:55:51,575 --> 00:55:56,137
It's cold! It's freezing. I'm fucking cold.

947
00:55:56,246 --> 00:55:58,441
You want my flak jacket?

948
00:55:58,549 --> 00:56:02,479
What, are you insane? It's boiling!
It's like a sweat lodge out here!

949
00:56:02,519 --> 00:56:05,416
Keep the volume down on that
bitching, Flatch Adams.

950
00:56:05,456 --> 00:56:07,418
I gotta take a fucking 12-pound shit!

951
00:56:07,458 --> 00:56:09,486
- How we doing? We making good time?
- We're making good time,

952
00:56:09,526 --> 00:56:12,723
but there's no way we make it
over that ridge before sundown.

953
00:56:12,763 --> 00:56:15,326
All right, fellas, we're
gonna make camp, rest up!

954
00:56:15,366 --> 00:56:17,728
- Oh, God.
- Y'all might be in for a treat.

955
00:56:17,768 --> 00:56:19,229
You know, back before the war broked out,

956
00:56:19,269 --> 00:56:21,999
I was a saucier in San Antone.

957
00:56:22,106 --> 00:56:24,802
I bet I could collar up
some of them greens.

958
00:56:24,842 --> 00:56:29,142
Yeah, noodle some crawfish
out the paddy, yo.

959
00:56:29,246 --> 00:56:33,602
And maybe some crab apples
for dessert, now, you hear? Hell, yeah!

960
00:56:34,618 --> 00:56:35,880
Hell, yeah!

961
00:56:35,986 --> 00:56:40,184
That's how we all talk.
We all talk like this, suh! Yes, suh.

962
00:56:40,290 --> 00:56:45,523
Yeah, get some crawfish and some ribs.

963
00:56:45,629 --> 00:56:50,498
You're Australian! Be Australian!
Excuse me, Kangaroo Jack.

964
00:56:54,738 --> 00:56:57,138
I get excited about my foods, man.

965
00:58:22,759 --> 00:58:25,193
Die!

966
00:58:39,109 --> 00:58:41,202
No!

967
00:58:47,751 --> 00:58:52,051
Dude, dude, what the hell
is going on here? Where are we?

968
00:58:52,155 --> 00:58:54,555
I have no idea.

969
00:58:54,658 --> 00:58:57,218
I've never been outside the States.

970
00:58:57,327 --> 00:58:59,556
Wait, what?
Are you fucking kidding me?

971
00:58:59,596 --> 00:59:01,658
Did you make this whole goddamn thing up?

972
00:59:01,664 --> 00:59:03,147
Dude, were you even in the fucking service?

973
00:59:03,166 --> 00:59:05,828
Yes. Of course. Coast Guard.

974
00:59:05,936 --> 00:59:07,898
- Coast Guard.
- Sanitation Department.

975
00:59:07,938 --> 00:59:10,644
Oh, my God!
You're a fucking garbage man!

976
00:59:10,741 --> 00:59:14,538
Damn it. F.L. Tayback lies to me
and the whole goddamn U.S. of A.

977
00:59:14,578 --> 00:59:17,307
I wrote the book as a tribute!
I'm a patriot!

978
00:59:17,347 --> 00:59:19,476
Yeah, you're the Milli
Vanilli of patriots, okay?

979
00:59:19,516 --> 00:59:21,278
You lied about fighting the Vietnam War.

980
00:59:21,318 --> 00:59:24,648
It's like punching the American flag
in the face, God damn it.

981
00:59:24,688 --> 00:59:26,183
God, and to think I believed in you!

982
00:59:26,223 --> 00:59:28,652
- I don't wanna be next to you.
- Writers lie all the time.

983
00:59:28,692 --> 00:59:31,068
Can I be tied to another post? Okay.

984
00:59:52,137 --> 00:59:53,968
- <i>Rick?</i>
- Tugg.

985
00:59:54,072 --> 00:59:56,131
I killed one, Rick.

986
00:59:57,275 --> 00:59:59,675
The thing I love most in the world.

987
00:59:59,777 --> 01:00:01,691
Vivica, get off the line now!

988
01:00:03,915 --> 01:00:06,377
A hooker. All right, you killed a hooker.

989
01:00:06,417 --> 01:00:08,546
Calm down.
Here's what you're gonna do.

990
01:00:08,586 --> 01:00:09,814
Get your hands on some bleach,

991
01:00:09,854 --> 01:00:12,283
some hydrogen peroxide
and a shitload of lime.

992
01:00:12,323 --> 01:00:13,813
No, a panda.

993
01:00:13,925 --> 01:00:15,688
<i>I killed a panda.</i>

994
01:00:15,793 --> 01:00:17,590
Amanda? Come on, dude.

995
01:00:17,695 --> 01:00:19,791
I mean, that's probably
not even her real name.

996
01:00:19,831 --> 01:00:21,492
No, a panda!

997
01:00:21,599 --> 01:00:22,964
A panda?

998
01:00:23,067 --> 01:00:25,661
A sweet, cuddly,

999
01:00:25,770 --> 01:00:27,704
<i>vicious little panda.</i>

1000
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:30,835
Jesus Christ, Tugg!
Man, don't scare me like that!

1001
01:00:30,875 --> 01:00:32,103
It's beautiful here.

1002
01:00:32,143 --> 01:00:33,633
<i>You on the set?</i>

1003
01:00:33,745 --> 01:00:35,007
I am the set.

1004
01:00:35,113 --> 01:00:38,143
All right, man.
Hey, how's the TiVo working out?

1005
01:00:38,183 --> 01:00:39,411
Screw TiVo.

1006
01:00:39,517 --> 01:00:41,985
I'm way beyond TiVo.

1007
01:00:42,086 --> 01:00:44,249
Last I checked, they hadn't
hooked it up, though.

1008
01:00:44,289 --> 01:00:47,588
Hadn't hooked it up? No TiVo?

1009
01:00:47,692 --> 01:00:49,523
It doesn't matter anymore.

1010
01:00:52,363 --> 01:00:53,830
I've moved on.

1011
01:00:54,566 --> 01:00:56,348
Where have you moved on to?

1012
01:00:56,401 --> 01:00:57,891
<i>Another agency?</i>

1013
01:00:59,437 --> 01:01:00,961
Who's with you?

1014
01:01:01,072 --> 01:01:03,301
It's Nick Stevens, isn't it?
That little fucker.

1015
01:01:03,341 --> 01:01:07,505
<i>You are still my client, Tugg Speedman!
I am getting the TiVo!</i>

1016
01:01:07,545 --> 01:01:09,740
Jacket's on, I'm out the door!

1017
01:01:09,847 --> 01:01:10,905
<i>Tugg?</i>

1018
01:01:14,219 --> 01:01:15,605
Please don't fire me.

1019
01:01:16,387 --> 01:01:17,641
I did it, I did it!

1020
01:01:17,689 --> 01:01:20,084
Vivica, what do I have
scheduled this afternoon?

1021
01:01:20,124 --> 01:01:22,991
- <i>Two and a Half Men</i> taping.
- Shit.

1022
01:01:23,995 --> 01:01:25,019
Cancel it.

1023
01:01:25,129 --> 01:01:26,858
And get me Tugg's <i>Tropic Thunder</i> contract.

1024
01:01:26,898 --> 01:01:30,094
I'm going to Grossman's
office, I'm playing the card.

1025
01:01:30,134 --> 01:01:31,101
Okay.

1026
01:01:34,706 --> 01:01:37,607
Oh, mama. Thirsty.

1027
01:01:37,742 --> 01:01:39,801
He doesn't look too good.

1028
01:01:39,911 --> 01:01:44,939
Must drink, so I can throw something up!

1029
01:01:45,049 --> 01:01:47,245
No, no. Don't drink that water!
That water's like a petri dish!

1030
01:01:47,285 --> 01:01:48,377
No, don't!

1031
01:01:48,486 --> 01:01:51,011
Alpa, do you have any Booty Sweat?

1032
01:01:51,122 --> 01:01:53,551
Yeah, get him chugging on
some of Alpa's ass water.

1033
01:01:53,591 --> 01:01:55,587
That'll bring him around. It's a cure-all.

1034
01:01:55,627 --> 01:01:57,589
Man, what you coming out
in movies for anyway?

1035
01:01:57,629 --> 01:01:59,357
Did you need another revenue stream?

1036
01:01:59,397 --> 01:02:02,195
For your information, my revenue stream

1037
01:02:02,300 --> 01:02:04,696
currently generates $2 million a year

1038
01:02:04,736 --> 01:02:06,731
in charitable contributions
for my community.

1039
01:02:06,771 --> 01:02:09,167
- Hot damn.
- And why am I in this movie?

1040
01:02:09,207 --> 01:02:11,603
Maybe I just knew I had to represent,

1041
01:02:11,643 --> 01:02:13,504
because they had one good
part in it for a black man

1042
01:02:13,544 --> 01:02:15,986
and they gave it to Crocodile Dundee.

1043
01:02:17,215 --> 01:02:20,845
Pump your brakes, kid.
That man is a national treasure.

1044
01:02:20,885 --> 01:02:23,081
I just wanted to throw another
shrimp on your barbie.

1045
01:02:23,121 --> 01:02:24,315
That shit ain't funny.

1046
01:02:24,355 --> 01:02:27,118
Hey, fellas! It's hot!
We're tired! It stinks!

1047
01:02:27,158 --> 01:02:28,786
I'm just fucking with you, Kangaroo Jack!

1048
01:02:28,826 --> 01:02:30,622
I'm sorry a dingo ate your baby.

1049
01:02:30,662 --> 01:02:33,191
You know that's a true story?
Lady lost her kid.

1050
01:02:33,231 --> 01:02:35,960
- You about to cross some fucking lines.
- Guys, relax and stuff.

1051
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:37,128
You know what? Fuck that, man!

1052
01:02:37,168 --> 01:02:40,402
I'm sick of this koala-hugging nigger
telling me…

1053
01:02:44,575 --> 01:02:46,133
For 400 years,

1054
01:02:47,178 --> 01:02:50,079
that word has kept us down.

1055
01:02:51,149 --> 01:02:52,776
What the fuck?

1056
01:02:52,884 --> 01:02:56,650
It took a whole lot of trying
just to get up that hill.

1057
01:02:56,754 --> 01:02:59,655
Now we up in the big leagues,

1058
01:02:59,757 --> 01:03:01,520
getting our turn at bat.

1059
01:03:01,626 --> 01:03:04,288
Long as we live, it's you and me, baby.

1060
01:03:04,962 --> 01:03:08,359
That's the theme song for
<i>The Jeffersons.</i> You really need help.

1061
01:03:08,399 --> 01:03:11,596
Yeah. Just 'cause it's the theme song,
don't make it not true.

1062
01:03:11,636 --> 01:03:13,631
You know what?
I'm gonna tell you what's true.

1063
01:03:13,671 --> 01:03:17,168
I'm gonna tag you back.
You better believe that, baby.

1064
01:03:17,208 --> 01:03:19,802
Guys! Hey, guys!

1065
01:03:20,411 --> 01:03:22,879
Jeff, stay away from that animal.

1066
01:03:25,249 --> 01:03:28,082
I'm gonna bite his hide. I need…

1067
01:03:29,120 --> 01:03:32,385
I need to wear his stomach
skin like a unitard.

1068
01:03:33,358 --> 01:03:36,657
Ain't nobody doing nothing
to no one or body!

1069
01:03:36,761 --> 01:03:41,630
Now, if Mr Portnoy is feeling
a little flu-ish, don't wanna walk,

1070
01:03:41,733 --> 01:03:44,241
put him up on that cloven-hoof animal!

1071
01:03:45,169 --> 01:03:46,687
We got ground to cover!

1072
01:04:15,466 --> 01:04:18,731
All right, POW camp, scene 67.

1073
01:04:19,637 --> 01:04:21,366
Bring it on, Cockburn!

1074
01:04:29,447 --> 01:04:31,943
Maybe he's not, you know,
Ridley Scott or something,

1075
01:04:31,983 --> 01:04:33,845
but I think Renny Harlin's
a tremendous filmmaker

1076
01:04:33,885 --> 01:04:36,748
like, <i>Adventures of Ford
Fairlane,</i> you know,

1077
01:04:36,788 --> 01:04:40,485
as far as an Andrew Dice Clay
vehicle goes, it's pretty decent.

1078
01:04:40,525 --> 01:04:43,020
And <i>Cliffhanger.
Cliffhanger's</i> incredible.

1079
01:04:43,060 --> 01:04:46,591
As far as the whole like,
man against nature type of movies go,

1080
01:04:46,631 --> 01:04:48,792
it's absolutely amazing.

1081
01:04:48,900 --> 01:04:50,800
Shut the fuck up!

1082
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:57,101
Who send you here?

1083
01:04:57,208 --> 01:05:01,838
Tayback, John, Sergeant,
United States Army.

1084
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:07,984
Serial number 694529987.

1085
01:05:11,789 --> 01:05:14,781
Perhaps some hot tea will make conversing

1086
01:05:14,892 --> 01:05:16,655
a little easier.

1087
01:05:20,431 --> 01:05:22,609
My leader's not quite as cordial.

1088
01:05:26,003 --> 01:05:28,933
Look, what? I just thought you might
like some hot tea

1089
01:05:28,973 --> 01:05:32,603
- in order to calm your nerves.
- Tayback, John, Sergeant,

1090
01:05:32,643 --> 01:05:37,603
United States Army, 694529987.

1091
01:05:38,449 --> 01:05:43,978
And here's a little message
from my Uncle Sam.

1092
01:05:49,627 --> 01:05:51,993
Dude, you all right?

1093
01:05:52,096 --> 01:05:53,591
Man you totally leaned into that.

1094
01:05:53,631 --> 01:05:56,733
I was pulling it back and
you just came in too…

1095
01:05:56,801 --> 01:05:58,996
Hey, it was an accident, man.

1096
01:06:01,539 --> 01:06:03,534
Come on, good.
You want to keep going?

1097
01:06:03,574 --> 01:06:05,166
- Let's go.
- Get up.

1098
01:06:05,276 --> 01:06:06,938
I rather rot in your V.C. Jail!

1099
01:06:06,978 --> 01:06:10,846
I'll never bend to your will!
You scum! You scum!

1100
01:06:10,948 --> 01:06:13,044
Now say this and go to the beginning again,

1101
01:06:13,084 --> 01:06:14,932
let's do the tea part, okay?

1102
01:06:16,387 --> 01:06:18,115
Dude, I hope you're not pissed.

1103
01:06:18,155 --> 01:06:20,017
I see moss on both sides of that tree.

1104
01:06:20,057 --> 01:06:23,254
Well, you know, maybe if I wasn't
the only one at boot camp…

1105
01:06:23,294 --> 01:06:25,256
My belly really hurts, you guys!

1106
01:06:25,296 --> 01:06:27,558
I'm not joking around, I'm nauseous.

1107
01:06:27,598 --> 01:06:29,894
Let me off, I gotta puke!
I don't wanna die like Hendrix!

1108
01:06:29,934 --> 01:06:31,595
All right. All right.

1109
01:06:36,173 --> 01:06:38,164
Are you okay, Jeff?

1110
01:06:38,276 --> 01:06:39,641
I'm awesome.

1111
01:06:42,046 --> 01:06:43,513
Holy shit!

1112
01:06:48,052 --> 01:06:50,230
Okay. Everyone, down, down, down.

1113
01:06:54,926 --> 01:06:56,416
Man. Now I'm tripping.

1114
01:06:56,527 --> 01:07:00,025
That looks like the POW camp
from out the script, yo.

1115
01:07:00,031 --> 01:07:01,726
Speedman was right?

1116
01:07:01,832 --> 01:07:03,197
I don't think so.

1117
01:07:03,301 --> 01:07:06,139
Look at the cooking vats, the armed guards.

1118
01:07:07,138 --> 01:07:09,580
Looks like a heroin processing plant.

1119
01:07:10,341 --> 01:07:11,536
We were in that chopper for hours.

1120
01:07:11,576 --> 01:07:13,905
I don't even think we're
in Vietnam anymore.

1121
01:07:13,945 --> 01:07:16,379
- Fuck.
- Shit. We ain't even in 'Nam?

1122
01:07:16,480 --> 01:07:19,244
No, most likely Myanmar or Laos.

1123
01:07:19,350 --> 01:07:20,908
What the fuck is Laos?

1124
01:07:21,018 --> 01:07:22,246
It's the Golden Triangle.

1125
01:07:22,286 --> 01:07:24,254
Oh, fuck. We're dead.

1126
01:07:24,355 --> 01:07:26,384
No one gets out of here. I saw it on TV.

1127
01:07:26,424 --> 01:07:30,516
Fucking boats, airplanes,
UFOs and shit, they all just vanish!

1128
01:07:30,561 --> 01:07:33,157
Yo, that's the Bermuda Triangle, dumb-ass.

1129
01:07:33,197 --> 01:07:35,563
This is the Golden Triangle.

1130
01:07:35,666 --> 01:07:37,295
It's the world's hard drug superhighway.

1131
01:07:37,335 --> 01:07:38,721
How do you know that?

1132
01:07:38,736 --> 01:07:42,498
It was a really long trip.
I read the in-flight magazine.

1133
01:07:43,274 --> 01:07:44,571
Cut!

1134
01:07:44,675 --> 01:07:46,142
Oh, Jesus!

1135
01:07:46,243 --> 01:07:48,734
What do you see, man? I'm blocked.

1136
01:07:48,846 --> 01:07:50,211
Damien, cut!

1137
01:07:51,983 --> 01:07:53,575
Hey, Damien, cut!

1138
01:07:54,418 --> 01:07:56,079
They got Speedman.

1139
01:07:56,654 --> 01:07:58,304
And it doesn't look good.

1140
01:08:30,755 --> 01:08:32,052
I am Tran.

1141
01:08:33,024 --> 01:08:35,664
You are a trespasser in my poppy fields.

1142
01:08:36,594 --> 01:08:39,222
You are DE. A. Scum!

1143
01:08:41,165 --> 01:08:44,601
Were there some re-writes
that I missed?

1144
01:08:50,908 --> 01:08:52,398
Do you want to die?

1145
01:08:53,177 --> 01:08:54,644
- Do you?
- No!

1146
01:08:54,745 --> 01:08:58,875
Please, don't hurt me!

1147
01:09:06,757 --> 01:09:07,951
Say that again.

1148
01:09:08,959 --> 01:09:10,756
Please, don't hurt me.

1149
01:09:10,861 --> 01:09:13,955
No! Like you did before! Say it!

1150
01:09:14,932 --> 01:09:15,921
Say it!

1151
01:09:16,033 --> 01:09:20,026
Please, don't hurt me!

1152
01:09:35,653 --> 01:09:38,247
- What?
- You are Simple Jack.

1153
01:09:41,225 --> 01:09:43,090
You saw <i>Simple Jack?</i>

1154
01:09:43,194 --> 01:09:45,966
We love the tale of this man, Simple Jack.

1155
01:09:47,231 --> 01:09:49,126
We do not have many luxury here.

1156
01:09:49,166 --> 01:09:51,662
And <i>Simple Jack</i> is the
only movie we possess.

1157
01:09:51,702 --> 01:09:55,536
You got the VHS.

1158
01:09:55,639 --> 01:09:57,768
We've watched it many, many times.

1159
01:09:57,808 --> 01:10:00,276
You should've got Oscar.

1160
01:10:03,314 --> 01:10:05,077
Well, you know. It's…

1161
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:07,678
Just to be nominated…

1162
01:10:07,718 --> 01:10:08,972
You were nominated?

1163
01:10:09,053 --> 01:10:10,648
No, no, no. I wasn't nominated.

1164
01:10:10,688 --> 01:10:13,918
I'm just saying that to have been
nominated would have been nice.

1165
01:10:13,958 --> 01:10:16,387
It's just… It's very political.
You have to take out ads…

1166
01:10:16,427 --> 01:10:18,918
- Shut up now!
- Okay. Okay.

1167
01:10:19,764 --> 01:10:21,493
So, are you going to

1168
01:10:23,134 --> 01:10:24,761
let me go, or…

1169
01:10:24,869 --> 01:10:26,996
No. We'll hold you for ransom.

1170
01:10:27,104 --> 01:10:28,901
Much more money now!

1171
01:10:40,484 --> 01:10:41,545
He's in a meeting.

1172
01:10:41,585 --> 01:10:44,951
Yeah, I know.
In about two seconds with the Pecker.

1173
01:10:45,389 --> 01:10:47,318
I'm gonna rip your fucking tits off.

1174
01:10:47,358 --> 01:10:50,087
You wanna talk about trouble?
That's trouble.

1175
01:10:50,127 --> 01:10:51,685
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1176
01:10:53,597 --> 01:10:55,497
What do you need, Peck?

1177
01:10:55,599 --> 01:10:58,227
No, more like what do you need, Les?

1178
01:10:58,335 --> 01:10:59,529
Glasses?

1179
01:11:00,604 --> 01:11:01,662
What?

1180
01:11:01,772 --> 01:11:04,335
So you can read the <i>Tropic Thunder</i> contract

1181
01:11:04,375 --> 01:11:06,837
that guarantees my client, Tugg Speedman,

1182
01:11:06,877 --> 01:11:10,608
some form of digital video
recorder on location.

1183
01:11:11,382 --> 01:11:13,890
- Huh?
- I can't believe you let him in.

1184
01:11:15,152 --> 01:11:18,048
Look, fuckstick, I'm incredibly busy,
so why don't you get the hell out of here

1185
01:11:18,088 --> 01:11:21,218
before I snap your dick off
and jam it into your ass?

1186
01:11:21,258 --> 01:11:23,283
No, not you, Helen.

1187
01:11:23,394 --> 01:11:27,158
But I will rip your tits off
if you don't get me those theaters.

1188
01:11:27,198 --> 01:11:28,722
Perfect.

1189
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:31,328
Hey, Tuggernuts, I've got
you on speakerphone.

1190
01:11:31,368 --> 01:11:33,297
I'm standing here with Les Grossman,

1191
01:11:33,337 --> 01:11:36,567
and he is dying to tell you
why he's apparently wiped his ass

1192
01:11:36,607 --> 01:11:39,247
with the TiVo clause from your contract.

1193
01:11:40,110 --> 01:11:42,101
We are Flaming Dragon.

1194
01:11:42,213 --> 01:11:44,579
Speedman is with us now.

1195
01:11:44,682 --> 01:11:48,243
<i>For 50 million, you will get him back.</i>

1196
01:11:48,352 --> 01:11:50,581
- Are you gonna get those…
- Who is this?

1197
01:11:50,621 --> 01:11:53,384
- And how did you get this phone?
- We are Flaming Dragon!

1198
01:11:53,424 --> 01:11:55,338
Simple Jack belong to us now.

1199
01:11:58,062 --> 01:12:00,087
He does, does he?

1200
01:12:00,197 --> 01:12:02,665
Let me tell you something, shitbird.

1201
01:12:02,766 --> 01:12:05,262
I've never even heard
of your little agency.

1202
01:12:05,302 --> 01:12:07,331
But if you think you can poach my client…

1203
01:12:07,371 --> 01:12:11,991
Send $50 million, or you no see
Simple Jack again because we kill him.

1204
01:12:12,009 --> 01:12:13,571
This is Les Grossman. Who is this?

1205
01:12:13,611 --> 01:12:15,909
This is Flaming Dragon!

1206
01:12:16,013 --> 01:12:18,777
Okay. Flaming Dragon. Fuckface.

1207
01:12:18,883 --> 01:12:23,718
First, take a big step back
and literally fuck your own face!

1208
01:12:25,089 --> 01:12:27,885
Now, I don't know what kind of
pan-Pacific bullshit power play

1209
01:12:27,925 --> 01:12:30,454
you're trying to pull here,
but Asia, Jack, is my territory.

1210
01:12:30,494 --> 01:12:31,856
<i>So whatever you're thinking,
you better think again.</i>

1211
01:12:31,896 --> 01:12:33,324
<i>Otherwise, I'm gonna
have to head down there,</i>

1212
01:12:33,364 --> 01:12:36,794
and I will rain down an ungodly
fucking firestorm upon you.

1213
01:12:36,834 --> 01:12:38,529
You're gonna have to call
the fucking United Nations

1214
01:12:38,569 --> 01:12:42,666
and get a fucking binding resolution
to keep me from fucking destroying you.

1215
01:12:42,706 --> 01:12:45,369
I am talking scorched earth, motherfucker!

1216
01:12:45,409 --> 01:12:47,172
I will massacre you!

1217
01:12:47,278 --> 01:12:49,212
I will fuck you up!

1218
01:12:57,021 --> 01:13:00,321
- Could you find out who that was? Go.
- Yeah. Yeah.

1219
01:13:34,191 --> 01:13:37,183
You wear these.
More like Simple Jack teeth.

1220
01:13:37,294 --> 01:13:39,023
Okay.

1221
01:13:39,129 --> 01:13:42,627
Hey. Look, I know you're a big fan,
and that's great…

1222
01:13:44,868 --> 01:13:46,495
Put teeth in!

1223
01:13:53,610 --> 01:13:55,475
Now do movie.

1224
01:13:55,579 --> 01:13:57,240
The whole movie?

1225
01:13:57,348 --> 01:13:59,076
I can't. I don't know the whole…

1226
01:13:59,116 --> 01:14:01,607
You perform! You perform or die!

1227
01:14:02,353 --> 01:14:03,843
Monkey swine!

1228
01:14:06,757 --> 01:14:08,156
Pa.

1229
01:14:10,127 --> 01:14:11,492
More stupid!

1230
01:14:13,263 --> 01:14:18,326
Pa, why you gotta make me feel bad?

1231
01:14:20,771 --> 01:14:22,102
You saw what I saw.

1232
01:14:22,206 --> 01:14:24,868
Tugg Speedman is dead meat if
we don't do something soon.

1233
01:14:24,908 --> 01:14:27,338
Yeah. We could do something
by getting our asses back to the hotel,

1234
01:14:27,378 --> 01:14:28,772
which is in the other direction!

1235
01:14:28,812 --> 01:14:30,404
Ain't right.

1236
01:14:30,514 --> 01:14:32,609
What would've happened in <i>The Great Escape</i>

1237
01:14:32,649 --> 01:14:36,483
if Steve McQueen and them dudes
had turned tail and ran?

1238
01:14:36,587 --> 01:14:40,651
Well, that's what that movie was about.
They were escaping. They ran away.

1239
01:14:40,691 --> 01:14:43,387
I'm trying to agree with you.
The point is they did something.

1240
01:14:43,427 --> 01:14:44,703
Then what are we supposed to do, huh?

1241
01:14:44,728 --> 01:14:48,692
'Cause he's cleaning a gun
with no bullets. Yeah, that's a plan.

1242
01:14:48,732 --> 01:14:53,220
I'm just like a little boy,
playing with his dick when he's nervous.

1243
01:14:56,073 --> 01:14:58,635
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1244
01:14:58,675 --> 01:15:01,735
I got an idea.
This might be a little crazy.

1245
01:15:01,845 --> 01:15:03,813
Crazy's better than nothing.

1246
01:15:03,914 --> 01:15:07,873
Back in '98, I did a low-budget
titty comedy for Skinemax.

1247
01:15:07,985 --> 01:15:11,318
- <i>Sex Camp.</i> Remember it?
- Yeah.

1248
01:15:11,422 --> 01:15:15,381
Anyway, me and the campers
from the uncool camp

1249
01:15:15,492 --> 01:15:18,017
had to break into the rich girl camp.

1250
01:15:18,128 --> 01:15:19,823
So, what we did,

1251
01:15:19,930 --> 01:15:22,966
we built a catapult out
of logs and underwear,

1252
01:15:23,033 --> 01:15:26,663
and they shot us over the
wall, and we parachuted down.

1253
01:15:32,209 --> 01:15:33,574
Look,

1254
01:15:33,677 --> 01:15:35,806
you guys, we already know the plan.

1255
01:15:35,846 --> 01:15:37,875
Are you fucking kidding me?
I'm giving you gold.

1256
01:15:37,915 --> 01:15:42,284
We do it just like in the book,
Chapter 26, the Wet Offensive.

1257
01:15:42,386 --> 01:15:44,786
The book of <i>Tropic Thunder.</i>

1258
01:15:44,888 --> 01:15:47,118
Yeah, did you guys read the book?

1259
01:15:48,425 --> 01:15:51,789
The flap, I read the back
flap and saw the pictures.

1260
01:15:51,829 --> 01:15:55,025
Well, it's okay.
It's exactly the same as in the script.

1261
01:15:55,065 --> 01:15:56,123
Cool.

1262
01:15:58,102 --> 01:16:00,662
You guys all read the script, right?

1263
01:16:00,771 --> 01:16:03,477
I don't read the script, script reads me.

1264
01:16:04,041 --> 01:16:05,569
What the hell does that even mean?

1265
01:16:05,609 --> 01:16:10,163
What you getting at with the books,
scripts? Spit that shit out, man!

1266
01:16:12,316 --> 01:16:14,230
All right. The Wet Offensive.

1267
01:16:15,185 --> 01:16:17,581
Osiris and Fats go
undercover as a diversion.

1268
01:16:17,621 --> 01:16:18,148
Osiris and Fats go
undercover as a diversion.

1269
01:16:18,188 --> 01:16:20,584
Motown and Brooklyn sneak in via the river.

1270
01:16:20,624 --> 01:16:23,462
Yeah. But those dudes
was trained soldiers.

1271
01:16:24,895 --> 01:16:25,953
Yeah!

1272
01:16:27,030 --> 01:16:30,022
And we trained actors, motherfucker.

1273
01:16:30,134 --> 01:16:34,468
Time to man up.
And I ain't gonna sugarcoat.

1274
01:16:34,571 --> 01:16:37,335
Some of us might not even make it back.

1275
01:16:37,441 --> 01:16:40,535
What do you mean?
Like not on the same flight?

1276
01:16:43,247 --> 01:16:46,076
Alpa and I's already wearing
earth mama's natural night camo.

1277
01:16:46,116 --> 01:16:47,947
- Cool it, Benson.
- Sorry.

1278
01:16:49,019 --> 01:16:53,705
We gonna scout, get a plan together.
We ain't back in 20, come looking.

1279
01:16:55,058 --> 01:16:56,972
<i>We are Flaming Dragon.</i>

1280
01:17:00,664 --> 01:17:01,858
Okay.

1281
01:17:03,167 --> 01:17:06,261
Flaming Dragon's a heroin manufacturer.

1282
01:17:06,370 --> 01:17:09,533
They're responsible
for an eighth of the drug trade in Asia.

1283
01:17:09,573 --> 01:17:12,804
- Huge profit margin.
- Guys!

1284
01:17:12,910 --> 01:17:15,906
Would somebody please let me
know what the game plan is?

1285
01:17:15,946 --> 01:17:17,675
Peck! We have it handled.

1286
01:17:17,781 --> 01:17:20,344
Please, don't interrupt.
Everything's under control.

1287
01:17:20,384 --> 01:17:22,375
I got it. Got it.

1288
01:17:34,498 --> 01:17:37,227
- Les Grossman.
- <i>We not get money yet.</i>

1289
01:17:37,267 --> 01:17:39,394
Price now 100 million!

1290
01:17:39,503 --> 01:17:42,336
You pay now, or tomorrow Simple Jack die.

1291
01:17:42,439 --> 01:17:45,499
Great. Let me get this down.

1292
01:17:45,609 --> 01:17:47,042
100 million.

1293
01:17:47,144 --> 01:17:49,612
Wait! I got a better idea.

1294
01:17:50,414 --> 01:17:52,245
Instead of 100 million,

1295
01:17:52,349 --> 01:17:55,216
how about I send you a hobo's dick cheese?

1296
01:17:55,319 --> 01:17:57,681
<i>Then you kill him! Do your thing!
Skin the fucking bastard!</i>

1297
01:17:57,721 --> 01:17:59,916
Go to town, man! Go to town!

1298
01:18:00,023 --> 01:18:02,252
- No…
- In the meantime, and as usual,

1299
01:18:02,292 --> 01:18:03,953
go fuck yourself!

1300
01:18:05,062 --> 01:18:07,768
- No.
- We don't negotiate with terrorists.

1301
01:18:09,733 --> 01:18:12,529
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey, hey, are you insane?

1302
01:18:12,569 --> 01:18:14,464
- I think I could've done that better.
- I thought it was good.

1303
01:18:14,504 --> 01:18:16,369
They're gonna kill him!

1304
01:18:19,443 --> 01:18:20,501
And?

1305
01:18:22,846 --> 01:18:23,972
“And?”

1306
01:18:25,349 --> 01:18:29,376
It's a cold, hard world. Shit happens.

1307
01:18:31,688 --> 01:18:34,885
We'll weep for him, in the press.

1308
01:18:35,025 --> 01:18:37,687
Set up a scholarship in his name.

1309
01:18:37,794 --> 01:18:41,730
Eventually, and I'm talking
way, way down the road,

1310
01:18:41,832 --> 01:18:43,393
we file an insurance claim.

1311
01:18:43,433 --> 01:18:46,296
Preferably before the
end of the fiscal year.

1312
01:18:46,336 --> 01:18:50,956
Actually, the claim alone would net us
more than the movie would lose.

1313
01:18:52,175 --> 01:18:53,938
You can't be serious.

1314
01:18:55,178 --> 01:18:56,807
You kick in the door to my house,

1315
01:18:56,847 --> 01:19:02,308
all ants in your pants,
sucking my left nut to get a TiVo scrap

1316
01:19:02,419 --> 01:19:07,015
for the third runner-up
Sexiest Man Alive 1998,

1317
01:19:07,124 --> 01:19:09,490
and you're asking if I'm serious?

1318
01:19:13,363 --> 01:19:15,058
Let's face it.

1319
01:19:15,165 --> 01:19:19,192
The kids aren't dressing up as
Scorcher for Purim anymore.

1320
01:19:20,604 --> 01:19:23,596
Speedman is a dying star,

1321
01:19:23,707 --> 01:19:26,938
a white dwarf heading for a black hole.

1322
01:19:27,044 --> 01:19:29,774
That's physics. It's inevitable.

1323
01:19:29,880 --> 01:19:33,277
We've been handed an incredible
opportunity here, Peck.

1324
01:19:33,317 --> 01:19:37,151
The universe is talking to us right now.

1325
01:19:37,254 --> 01:19:38,812
You just gotta listen.

1326
01:19:51,935 --> 01:19:55,599
See, this is the good part, Pecker.
This is when the job gets fun.

1327
01:19:55,639 --> 01:19:56,731
Yeah.

1328
01:19:56,840 --> 01:20:00,003
Ask and you shall receive.

1329
01:20:01,044 --> 01:20:05,174
- All right.
- You play ball, we play ball.

1330
01:20:05,282 --> 01:20:08,649
I know you want the goodies.

1331
01:20:08,752 --> 01:20:10,743
Welcome to the goody room.

1332
01:20:10,854 --> 01:20:15,484
You paying attention?
'Cause I'm talking G5 for the Pecker.

1333
01:20:15,592 --> 01:20:16,920
That's how you're gonna roll.

1334
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:20,919
No more frequent flier
bitch miles for my boy.

1335
01:20:21,031 --> 01:20:22,328
Yeah!

1336
01:20:22,833 --> 01:20:24,095
Playa.

1337
01:20:24,968 --> 01:20:26,299
Playa!

1338
01:20:27,337 --> 01:20:28,634
Big dick playa.

1339
01:20:28,739 --> 01:20:30,730
Swinging past your knees!

1340
01:20:30,841 --> 01:20:31,865
Big dick, baby.

1341
01:20:31,975 --> 01:20:33,169
Yep.

1342
01:20:36,513 --> 01:20:39,107
Or you can grow a conscience

1343
01:20:39,216 --> 01:20:42,780
in the next five minutes and
see where that takes you.

1344
01:20:46,556 --> 01:20:48,649
Let me get this straight.

1345
01:20:48,759 --> 01:20:52,388
You want me to let my client of 15 years,

1346
01:20:52,496 --> 01:20:53,924
one of my best friends,

1347
01:20:53,964 --> 01:20:58,594
die in the jungle, alone,
for some money and a G5?

1348
01:20:59,736 --> 01:21:00,862
Yes.

1349
01:21:05,942 --> 01:21:08,206
A G5 airplane?

1350
01:21:10,313 --> 01:21:11,371
Yes.

1351
01:21:12,449 --> 01:21:15,145
And lots of money.

1352
01:21:16,520 --> 01:21:18,681
Playa.

1353
01:21:21,591 --> 01:21:22,785
Yeah!

1354
01:21:24,027 --> 01:21:26,621
Smack it up, flip it, rub it down!

1355
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:31,861
But Mama take care of Jack a lot.

1356
01:21:32,702 --> 01:21:36,433
How many more sleeps
before she wakes up again?

1357
01:21:36,540 --> 01:21:38,064
Sorry, Jack.

1358
01:21:38,175 --> 01:21:40,439
She in heaven now.

1359
01:21:41,211 --> 01:21:44,476
Damn! I thought the movie was bad.

1360
01:21:44,581 --> 01:21:47,709
She sleep forever.

1361
01:21:47,818 --> 01:21:51,014
To the mars credit, he's actually
eased up on the retard throttle.

1362
01:21:51,054 --> 01:21:54,718
And now that's added a balance,
and the audience can connect.

1363
01:21:54,758 --> 01:21:58,622
I mean, this is Theater 101,
but, you know, he's had a tough road.

1364
01:21:58,662 --> 01:21:59,856
He'll become a naturalist.

1365
01:21:59,896 --> 01:22:01,658
- Yeah.
- Break down the aesthetic distance,

1366
01:22:01,698 --> 01:22:03,427
then the…

1367
01:22:06,102 --> 01:22:07,818
Told you I'd tag you back.

1368
01:22:10,407 --> 01:22:12,671
Can I tell you that I'm sorry

1369
01:22:12,776 --> 01:22:15,138
for any offense I might've caused, man?

1370
01:22:15,178 --> 01:22:17,607
- I just got caught up in…
- In being a dumb-ass?

1371
01:22:17,647 --> 01:22:19,046
I guess so.

1372
01:22:19,149 --> 01:22:21,912
Why you still doing this
Chicken George shit, I have no idea.

1373
01:22:21,952 --> 01:22:23,313
- Neither do I.
- It's beyond me.

1374
01:22:23,353 --> 01:22:25,548
- It's beyond me.
- You confused.

1375
01:22:25,655 --> 01:22:27,833
- I am a little confused.
- I know.

1376
01:22:29,192 --> 01:22:30,989
But are we cool?

1377
01:22:31,094 --> 01:22:32,425
Not really.

1378
01:22:36,233 --> 01:22:37,825
Hey, man.

1379
01:22:37,934 --> 01:22:39,696
- How's it going?
- Good. Yourself?

1380
01:22:39,736 --> 01:22:41,761
Hey, so, if it's no big deal,

1381
01:22:41,872 --> 01:22:44,801
I think I'm just gonna hang
back here for the mission.

1382
01:22:44,841 --> 01:22:46,468
Watch the stuff.

1383
01:22:46,576 --> 01:22:48,601
- Is that cool?
- What? No!

1384
01:22:48,712 --> 01:22:50,612
We need you, Jeff.

1385
01:22:50,714 --> 01:22:52,375
What are you talking about?

1386
01:22:52,415 --> 01:22:53,973
Okay, look, man.

1387
01:22:55,218 --> 01:22:57,594
- I got something to tell you.
- Okay.

1388
01:22:59,756 --> 01:23:02,486
You know those jellybeans I was eating?

1389
01:23:02,592 --> 01:23:05,686
Well, they weren't jellybeans, okay?

1390
01:23:06,596 --> 01:23:09,394
- They were drugs.
- Really?

1391
01:23:09,499 --> 01:23:13,930
I get down there near the mother lode,
I am done. I'm jonesing bad, man.

1392
01:23:13,970 --> 01:23:17,732
I'm gonna fucking do all the
heroin in the fucking world.

1393
01:23:20,210 --> 01:23:25,160
If you guys wanna make it through
this thing, you gotta strap me to a tree.

1394
01:23:25,749 --> 01:23:29,515
- Are you serious?
- Yeah, I'm serious. Literally, a tree.

1395
01:23:29,619 --> 01:23:32,549
And you can, no matter what, you can't
fucking untie me until it is done,

1396
01:23:32,589 --> 01:23:34,217
until it is out of my system.

1397
01:23:34,257 --> 01:23:35,952
I'm gonna say,
“Hey, man, I'm cool. It's cool.

1398
01:23:35,992 --> 01:23:37,621
I'm finally better. I'm finally better.
Untie me.”

1399
01:23:37,661 --> 01:23:40,924
Don't listen to me!
Anything I fucking say is a lie!

1400
01:23:40,964 --> 01:23:42,295
You got it!

1401
01:23:42,966 --> 01:23:45,025
Goodbye, Mama!

1402
01:23:45,135 --> 01:23:48,263
Now you can have ice cream in heaven.

1403
01:23:48,371 --> 01:23:53,331
I'll see you tonight, when I
go to bed, in my head movies.

1404
01:23:54,277 --> 01:23:58,873
But this head movie makes my eyes rain.

1405
01:24:07,924 --> 01:24:11,155
Dang.
Short-bus is taking some real hits.

1406
01:24:13,029 --> 01:24:15,926
- They got him on the move!
- That's torture, man.

1407
01:24:15,966 --> 01:24:18,833
Okay. That's where they keeping him.

1408
01:24:18,935 --> 01:24:21,197
I gotta get cracking on my costume.

1409
01:24:21,237 --> 01:24:22,720
Say, are you good with a needle and thread?

1410
01:24:22,739 --> 01:24:23,763
Hell, yeah.

1411
01:24:23,873 --> 01:24:27,270
Alpa Chino chinos sold more than
five million pairs last spring at the Gap.

1412
01:24:27,310 --> 01:24:30,808
- I sewed them patterns myself, baby.
- Let's roll out.

1413
01:25:02,012 --> 01:25:04,242
It's a little twig man Oscar.

1414
01:25:10,854 --> 01:25:13,254
I'm going to call you Half Squat.

1415
01:25:14,958 --> 01:25:16,926
And you can call me...

1416
01:25:17,994 --> 01:25:19,291
Papa.

1417
01:25:42,786 --> 01:25:44,700
Wow, look at all those stars.

1418
01:25:46,489 --> 01:25:48,931
Really makes a guy feel pretty small.

1419
01:25:49,993 --> 01:25:53,359
This could be the last time
we look at these stars.

1420
01:25:53,530 --> 01:25:54,997
Man, that's beauty.

1421
01:25:56,933 --> 01:26:00,063
Nights like tonight make a man
wonder what it's all about.

1422
01:26:00,103 --> 01:26:02,875
Hey, you guys.
Anybody got some bug spray?

1423
01:26:04,240 --> 01:26:05,366
Don't ignore me!

1424
01:26:05,475 --> 01:26:08,643
Stick it out, man.
We're gonna get through this.

1425
01:26:09,479 --> 01:26:11,538
- Hey, Kirk?
- Yeah?

1426
01:26:11,648 --> 01:26:14,481
Are you still dating Jennifer Love Hewitt?

1427
01:26:14,584 --> 01:26:16,046
'Cause I think she's hot.

1428
01:26:16,086 --> 01:26:19,453
No, that was just some tabloid conjecture.

1429
01:26:19,556 --> 01:26:23,582
Hey, guys, I'm good. I made it through.
You can untie me now.

1430
01:26:24,627 --> 01:26:25,958
Funny, huh?

1431
01:26:26,062 --> 01:26:28,966
The circus life 280 days
a year on location.

1432
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:34,094
It's hard to find a girl
that can hang with that, you know?

1433
01:26:34,904 --> 01:26:36,963
Not one worth keeping, nohow.

1434
01:26:37,073 --> 01:26:39,371
Hey, Radar? Evans?

1435
01:26:39,476 --> 01:26:40,534
No, it's Kevin.

1436
01:26:40,643 --> 01:26:42,439
Kev, whatever the fuck.
Come over here.

1437
01:26:42,479 --> 01:26:44,774
I didn't tell you, but <i>Fatties: Fart Three</i>
is coming down the pike,

1438
01:26:44,814 --> 01:26:48,378
and there's a role in there for you
if you come over and untie me.

1439
01:26:48,418 --> 01:26:51,047
Jeff, you're just going
to have to tough it out.

1440
01:26:51,087 --> 01:26:53,116
Your mother's a cankerous whore!

1441
01:26:53,156 --> 01:26:54,487
Jesus, man.

1442
01:26:55,525 --> 01:26:56,992
Hey, man.

1443
01:26:57,093 --> 01:27:00,056
Remember way back when I said
your mother was a cankerous whore?

1444
01:27:00,096 --> 01:27:03,497
I'm sorry, man.
I did not mean that. She's not.

1445
01:27:03,600 --> 01:27:05,295
How about you, man?

1446
01:27:05,435 --> 01:27:07,931
You got some little minx waiting for you
on the other side of tomorrow?

1447
01:27:07,971 --> 01:27:09,438
Me?

1448
01:27:09,539 --> 01:27:12,303
I've barely even had a girlfriend, and…

1449
01:27:13,143 --> 01:27:16,873
I was really hoping I'd get
laid when this movie came out,

1450
01:27:16,913 --> 01:27:19,313
but that's not gonna happen.

1451
01:27:20,183 --> 01:27:21,711
What about you, Masterblaster?

1452
01:27:21,751 --> 01:27:24,447
You got a certain someone you trying
to get with back in the States?

1453
01:27:24,487 --> 01:27:29,220
What, Alpa Chino?
He's like 10 girls deep, 24/7.

1454
01:27:29,325 --> 01:27:30,620
No. You missing me, man.

1455
01:27:30,660 --> 01:27:32,522
I'm talking about something special.
Big difference.

1456
01:27:32,562 --> 01:27:33,756
How about it?

1457
01:27:34,531 --> 01:27:35,657
Yeah.

1458
01:27:37,066 --> 01:27:39,034
Yeah, there is.

1459
01:27:39,135 --> 01:27:42,532
Well? What's the skinny?
Y'all been on a date or what?

1460
01:27:42,572 --> 01:27:44,472
No. I mean…

1461
01:27:44,574 --> 01:27:49,409
I always wanted to, but I guess
I just never had the courage to ask.

1462
01:27:49,512 --> 01:27:51,207
It's… It's complicated.

1463
01:27:51,314 --> 01:27:53,748
No! It's simple as pie, man.

1464
01:27:53,850 --> 01:27:56,513
You plant your feet in the ground, you
look her square in the eyes, you say,

1465
01:27:56,553 --> 01:28:00,250
“Hey, baby, you and me's going
on a date.” That's the end of story.

1466
01:28:00,290 --> 01:28:02,986
- What's her name?
- Lance.

1467
01:28:03,092 --> 01:28:04,855
"Listen here, Lance…."

1468
01:28:05,728 --> 01:28:09,528
Lance? What the fuck did I just hear?
Lance?

1469
01:28:09,632 --> 01:28:11,361
- Did you say “Lance”?
- No!

1470
01:28:11,467 --> 01:28:13,463
- That sounded like “Lance.”
- No, I said “Nance.”

1471
01:28:13,503 --> 01:28:15,732
- That's what I said, “Nance.”
- It sounded like “Lance.”

1472
01:28:15,772 --> 01:28:17,367
Look, I'm Alpa Chino, okay?

1473
01:28:17,407 --> 01:28:19,135
I love the pussy! All right?

1474
01:28:19,175 --> 01:28:21,171
Lay your ass back down
and look at the stars.

1475
01:28:21,211 --> 01:28:22,605
When you wrote <i>I Love Tha Pussy</i>

1476
01:28:22,645 --> 01:28:26,075
was you thinking of dangling your dice
on Lance's forehead?

1477
01:28:26,115 --> 01:28:28,481
Oh, hell, no! What? Come on. Look.

1478
01:28:28,585 --> 01:28:31,581
- Man, everyone's gay once in a while.
- I'm not gay!

1479
01:28:31,621 --> 01:28:32,645
This Hollywood.

1480
01:28:32,725 --> 01:28:33,898
How about we all get back to work?

1481
01:28:33,923 --> 01:28:35,652
- Okay. Cool.
- This is ridiculous!

1482
01:28:35,692 --> 01:28:38,662
We got a big day tomorrow.
Let's get focused.

1483
01:28:41,164 --> 01:28:45,999
Alpa, if you untie me,
I will literally suck your dick right now.

1484
01:28:46,102 --> 01:28:49,333
I told you, for the last
time, I love the pussy!

1485
01:28:50,707 --> 01:28:53,540
I'll cradle the balls, stroke the shaft,

1486
01:28:53,643 --> 01:28:56,737
work the pipe and swallow the gravy.

1487
01:28:56,846 --> 01:28:59,420
Get it over here, buddy. Let's do this.

1488
01:29:05,488 --> 01:29:06,616
Okay, so, what's the plan?

1489
01:29:06,656 --> 01:29:08,117
Are you gonna talk
Vietnamese to those dudes?

1490
01:29:08,157 --> 01:29:09,920
No. No. Mandarin Chinese.

1491
01:29:10,026 --> 01:29:11,788
Which, from what I can tell,
is what they speaking down there.

1492
01:29:11,828 --> 01:29:13,456
How the hell do you know Chinese?

1493
01:29:13,496 --> 01:29:17,026
<i>Land of Silk and Money</i> with Gong Li.
Second Globe, third Oscar.

1494
01:29:17,066 --> 01:29:21,097
Prepped for that one by working in
a Beijing textile factory for eight months.

1495
01:29:21,137 --> 01:29:23,071
That might be our ride.

1496
01:29:39,822 --> 01:29:41,117
The straps are too tight!

1497
01:29:41,157 --> 01:29:43,523
Shut your mouth and follow my lead.

1498
01:30:11,421 --> 01:30:14,390
The straps are cutting off my circulation!

1499
01:30:14,490 --> 01:30:15,457
Fuck you!

1500
01:30:22,966 --> 01:30:25,870
Not the fucking bull again.
Fucking asshole.

1501
01:31:19,922 --> 01:31:22,618
Laz, don't let him take me off the yak.

1502
01:31:27,130 --> 01:31:29,394
Bitch whore! Fucking hate you!

1503
01:31:39,542 --> 01:31:40,736
Okay.

1504
01:31:42,945 --> 01:31:44,503
All right.

1505
01:31:44,614 --> 01:31:47,076
That looks like it could be the
munitions hut right there.

1506
01:31:47,116 --> 01:31:50,548
I'm gonna try to find Speedman
in the main building.

1507
01:32:07,070 --> 01:32:10,833
I don't know Chinese but it sounds like
your improvising is for shit.

1508
01:32:10,873 --> 01:32:11,999
Oh, fuck!

1509
01:32:27,523 --> 01:32:29,115
Get over here!

1510
01:32:30,493 --> 01:32:32,121
- What are you guys doing here?
- He has hands.

1511
01:32:32,161 --> 01:32:34,561
- He killed Damien.
- Bullshit!

1512
01:32:34,664 --> 01:32:37,172
- He blinded Jamie Lee Curtis.
- Almost!

1513
01:32:37,266 --> 01:32:40,530
What are you talking about?
Damien stepped on a old landmine.

1514
01:32:40,570 --> 01:32:42,128
Sweet. Thank God.

1515
01:32:42,238 --> 01:32:45,010
- We busting Speedman out.
- Speedmars here?

1516
01:33:12,602 --> 01:33:15,264
I take it y'all are doing the
Wet Offensive from the book.

1517
01:33:15,304 --> 01:33:16,632
I can give y'all a diversion.

1518
01:33:16,672 --> 01:33:22,150
I got enough shit here to light this place
up like it's the Fourth of fucking July.

1519
01:34:02,084 --> 01:34:04,552
Yes, your farm.

1520
01:34:08,925 --> 01:34:11,325
Where is your farm,

1521
01:34:12,895 --> 01:34:14,362
American?

1522
01:34:17,200 --> 01:34:18,462
My farm?

1523
01:34:20,403 --> 01:34:21,665
Oh, shit.

1524
01:34:22,438 --> 01:34:25,635
Here's my motherfucking farm!

1525
01:34:25,741 --> 01:34:27,231
Yeah!

1526
01:34:32,181 --> 01:34:35,173
Yeah! Chicka-chickaw, baby!

1527
01:34:36,185 --> 01:34:37,379
Kwan-Lo!

1528
01:34:38,888 --> 01:34:41,000
I'm a lead farmer, motherfucker!

1529
01:34:41,290 --> 01:34:42,450
Yeah!

1530
01:34:44,026 --> 01:34:47,326
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, keep your head down!

1531
01:34:47,330 --> 01:34:49,594
Keep your head down on the ground!

1532
01:34:49,699 --> 01:34:51,928
Nobody move or I do the little big guy!

1533
01:34:51,968 --> 01:34:55,404
That's right,
we running this program now, J.P.

1534
01:34:55,504 --> 01:34:58,132
Now show me where the drugs are.

1535
01:34:58,241 --> 01:35:00,038
What the fuck?

1536
01:35:00,142 --> 01:35:01,837
That ain't the plan!

1537
01:35:01,944 --> 01:35:03,639
Don't judge me!

1538
01:35:07,316 --> 01:35:09,428
He's got a real serious problem.

1539
01:35:09,885 --> 01:35:12,149
Hey! Hey, you!

1540
01:35:12,255 --> 01:35:14,450
Take off your clothes!

1541
01:35:14,557 --> 01:35:16,218
Take off your clothes!

1542
01:35:16,325 --> 01:35:17,622
What do we do now?

1543
01:35:17,727 --> 01:35:19,622
Stick with the plan. Find Speedman.

1544
01:35:19,662 --> 01:35:22,124
Alpa, keep this clown posse down.
Come on now.

1545
01:35:22,164 --> 01:35:25,531
Y'all heard the man.
Be suede, don't move!

1546
01:35:25,635 --> 01:35:27,597
Fuck your do-rag. Fuck your do-rag.

1547
01:35:27,637 --> 01:35:30,128
- Door!
- One, two, three!

1548
01:35:43,419 --> 01:35:45,250
I go high, you go low.

1549
01:35:49,625 --> 01:35:53,556
Get down. Get down! Get down!
Chow Yun-Fat, get the hell down!

1550
01:35:53,596 --> 01:35:57,820
If I see one more head pop up,
it's gonna be bullet Whac-A-Mole.

1551
01:35:58,467 --> 01:35:59,900
Come on, come on!

1552
01:36:00,002 --> 01:36:02,312
- Smoke grenade.
- Don't drop it now.

1553
01:36:02,672 --> 01:36:04,230
Here.

1554
01:36:04,340 --> 01:36:06,402
- What's this?
- I don't know what it's called.

1555
01:36:06,442 --> 01:36:06,802
- What's this?
- I don't know what it's called.

1556
01:36:06,842 --> 01:36:09,505
I just know the sound
it makes when it lies.

1557
01:36:09,545 --> 01:36:13,072
Don't move, Matchbox, or I will shoot you.

1558
01:36:13,182 --> 01:36:16,049
I'm gonna put on this thing. Don't move.

1559
01:36:16,152 --> 01:36:17,881
I can still see you.

1560
01:36:24,026 --> 01:36:25,118
Tugg!

1561
01:36:27,663 --> 01:36:28,823
Tugg?

1562
01:36:30,900 --> 01:36:32,094
Gotcha.

1563
01:36:33,269 --> 01:36:36,170
Roll your shit up, man. We going home.

1564
01:36:36,272 --> 01:36:37,398
Home?

1565
01:36:39,542 --> 01:36:43,439
But I'm doing five shows a day
for a standing-room-only crowd.

1566
01:36:43,479 --> 01:36:46,039
Don't you get it? I already am home.

1567
01:36:48,351 --> 01:36:51,479
All right, now, dude, you gotta get it…

1568
01:36:51,587 --> 01:36:53,782
My son gave this to me.

1569
01:36:53,889 --> 01:36:57,381
- That's your stick buddy?
- His name is Twigman.

1570
01:36:57,493 --> 01:36:59,324
Does he wanna come with us?

1571
01:37:20,316 --> 01:37:22,443
Get down! Get down! Get down!

1572
01:37:22,551 --> 01:37:27,511
Maybe y'all heard of me.
Y'all heard of Alpa Chino? No?

1573
01:37:27,623 --> 01:37:30,152
<i>♪ I love that pussy,
hell, yeah, hell, yeah ♪</i>

1574
01:37:30,192 --> 01:37:31,754
They're not your demo, dude.

1575
01:37:31,794 --> 01:37:34,256
Come on.
Six motherfucking VMAs, baby.

1576
01:37:34,296 --> 01:37:37,493
Two BET Awards. Alpa Chino.

1577
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:44,005
Like him in <i>Carlito's Way?</i>

1578
01:37:44,373 --> 01:37:47,103
Hey, yo, you know what?
Speak English. I don't speak that stuff.

1579
01:37:47,143 --> 01:37:49,077
What're you sayin'? Huh?

1580
01:37:49,178 --> 01:37:53,740
<i>Devil's Advocate. Dog Day Afternoon.</i>

1581
01:37:54,116 --> 01:37:56,949
<i>Cruising. Sea of Love.</i>

1582
01:37:57,052 --> 01:38:00,044
Real Al Pacino.

1583
01:38:00,156 --> 01:38:03,819
Get the fuck down. That's a whole
different dude altogether.

1584
01:38:03,859 --> 01:38:06,989
What you doing? What you doing?
Don't touch that gun.

1585
01:38:07,029 --> 01:38:08,491
Don't do it! Don't touch that gun!

1586
01:38:08,531 --> 01:38:10,841
On my momma, if you touch that gun…

1587
01:38:15,471 --> 01:38:17,871
- Oh, shit, it's on!
- Over here!

1588
01:38:52,274 --> 01:38:54,103
- What're you doing?
- I'm gonna give these boys

1589
01:38:54,143 --> 01:38:55,770
a Hanoi high-five.

1590
01:39:08,424 --> 01:39:09,810
Shadow me, Pinocchio!

1591
01:39:10,559 --> 01:39:11,787
Smoke!

1592
01:39:17,633 --> 01:39:19,328
Oh, shit!

1593
01:39:24,173 --> 01:39:25,697
Jeff, don't!

1594
01:39:26,542 --> 01:39:28,533
It doesn't matter what I do.

1595
01:39:28,644 --> 01:39:31,674
I'll always be a screw-up.
No one'll ever respect me.

1596
01:39:31,714 --> 01:39:35,778
That is not true, you are not a screw-up!
You make so many people laugh.

1597
01:39:35,818 --> 01:39:38,048
They only laugh at my farts.

1598
01:39:38,153 --> 01:39:40,199
Jeff, we really need to go now!

1599
01:39:40,256 --> 01:39:41,848
This is all I deserve!

1600
01:40:02,011 --> 01:40:04,241
Laugh at that, you bastards!

1601
01:40:04,346 --> 01:40:07,747
Hilarious! Hilarious!

1602
01:40:09,285 --> 01:40:12,849
Let's move. We only have 16 hours
before they wake up.

1603
01:40:28,404 --> 01:40:30,065
Sounds like the dinner bell's ringing.

1604
01:40:30,105 --> 01:40:34,659
These assholes are gonna be crawling
in here ready to fucking eat us.

1605
01:40:35,978 --> 01:40:38,845
There. All right, you keep six right here.

1606
01:40:40,783 --> 01:40:42,944
Come on, let's go.

1607
01:40:43,052 --> 01:40:45,047
Come on, what are you guys doing?
Let's get out of here!

1608
01:40:45,087 --> 01:40:46,748
He's on tilt status.

1609
01:40:46,855 --> 01:40:50,886
Same thing happened to me when
I played Neil Armstrong in <i>Moonshot.</i>

1610
01:40:50,926 --> 01:40:53,088
They found me in an alley in Burbank

1611
01:40:53,128 --> 01:40:57,059
trying to re-enter the Earth's
atmosphere in an old refrigerator box.

1612
01:40:57,099 --> 01:40:58,227
What're you talking about?

1613
01:40:58,267 --> 01:41:00,696
Come on, fellas, we really need to go.

1614
01:41:00,736 --> 01:41:05,173
Daggomit, Blamtucky,
I ain't re-programming a VCR.

1615
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:13,375
Give me the flame thrower.
You gotta start the chopper.

1616
01:41:13,415 --> 01:41:17,903
- No, fuck that! Just give me this.
- No time! I'll take care of this!

1617
01:41:18,087 --> 01:41:20,067
All right. Give me your hooks.

1618
01:41:20,089 --> 01:41:21,784
Don't worry, I'm not
gonna put them on again.

1619
01:41:21,824 --> 01:41:24,720
- Just give me your goddamn hooks.
- All right. Here.

1620
01:41:24,760 --> 01:41:27,400
Get those boys back to the bird, pronto!

1621
01:41:31,867 --> 01:41:34,028
Shit! Enough!

1622
01:41:34,136 --> 01:41:36,036
Fake shit!

1623
01:41:39,141 --> 01:41:40,267
Fuck!

1624
01:41:47,983 --> 01:41:51,146
Go get your guys!
Get them to the chopper!

1625
01:41:51,253 --> 01:41:53,346
I'll take care of these yahoos!

1626
01:41:55,391 --> 01:41:57,720
You're gonna focus up now,
motherfucker, and say it.

1627
01:41:57,760 --> 01:41:59,938
- “It's me, Tugg!”
- It's me, Tugg.

1628
01:41:59,995 --> 01:42:01,523
That's right! Now, Tugg who?

1629
01:42:01,563 --> 01:42:04,361
- Tugg who? I don't know. Who are you?
- Me?

1630
01:42:04,466 --> 01:42:06,161
I know who I am!

1631
01:42:06,268 --> 01:42:09,999
I'm a dude playing a dude
disguised as another dude.

1632
01:42:10,105 --> 01:42:11,163
What?

1633
01:42:11,273 --> 01:42:13,435
You a dude that don't know what dude he is!

1634
01:42:13,475 --> 01:42:16,238
Or are you a dude who has
no idea what dude he is

1635
01:42:16,278 --> 01:42:17,606
and claims to know what dude he is…

1636
01:42:17,646 --> 01:42:19,475
What the fuck are you guys talking about?

1637
01:42:19,515 --> 01:42:20,676
...by playing other dudes?

1638
01:42:20,716 --> 01:42:21,977
I know what dude I am!

1639
01:42:22,017 --> 01:42:24,880
- You're scared.
- I ain't scared. Scared of what?

1640
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:26,182
Or scared of who?

1641
01:42:26,288 --> 01:42:28,951
- Scared of who?
- Come on, guys. We really need to go!

1642
01:42:28,991 --> 01:42:30,253
Scared of you.

1643
01:42:35,164 --> 01:42:37,496
- Jesus.
- What's going on?

1644
01:42:37,599 --> 01:42:39,123
The dudes are emerging.

1645
01:42:39,234 --> 01:42:40,620
He's right, you know.

1646
01:42:42,337 --> 01:42:43,736
I am not...

1647
01:42:45,307 --> 01:42:47,002
Sergeant Lincoln Osiris.

1648
01:42:51,413 --> 01:42:52,880
We gotta roll out.

1649
01:42:52,981 --> 01:42:56,212
Nor am I Father O'Malley.

1650
01:42:58,454 --> 01:43:01,389
Or Neil Armstrong.

1651
01:43:08,964 --> 01:43:11,125
I think I might be nobody.

1652
01:43:12,534 --> 01:43:13,694
Wow!

1653
01:43:13,802 --> 01:43:17,036
The insecurity level with
you guys is ridiculous!

1654
01:43:17,740 --> 01:43:20,769
- Everybody's got issues!
- Yeah, man, everybody got issues.

1655
01:43:20,809 --> 01:43:23,369
Come on! You're Kirk Lazarus.

1656
01:43:23,479 --> 01:43:25,708
You're the whole reason I got into acting.

1657
01:43:25,748 --> 01:43:27,643
I memorized every single monologue

1658
01:43:27,683 --> 01:43:30,345
you ever did when I was in theater school.

1659
01:43:30,385 --> 01:43:32,431
- Really?
- Yeah. And look, Tugg!

1660
01:43:32,521 --> 01:43:35,017
I saw <i>Scorcher I</i> 24 times
when I was in eighth grade.

1661
01:43:35,057 --> 01:43:38,087
That shit blew me away!
I got high to that shit! You the man!

1662
01:43:38,127 --> 01:43:41,323
Yeah, man, <i>Scorcher I</i> was great.
Let's get the fuck out of here!

1663
01:43:41,363 --> 01:43:45,493
Tugg, Tugger, you're the last
piece of the puzzle, buddy.

1664
01:43:45,601 --> 01:43:48,769
We need you! Your men need you!
Are you with us?

1665
01:43:52,941 --> 01:43:54,932
I'm a rooster illusion.

1666
01:43:55,043 --> 01:43:56,305
Fuck it. We'll deal with him later.

1667
01:43:56,345 --> 01:43:59,777
Let's move. Come on. Come on.
Double time. Gotta go!

1668
01:44:02,050 --> 01:44:03,847
Come on, come on, come on.

1669
01:44:07,623 --> 01:44:09,557
Bingo! Move out.

1670
01:44:11,493 --> 01:44:12,858
Oh, God.

1671
01:44:14,830 --> 01:44:17,734
Just say no to this,
you drug-making midget.

1672
01:44:22,271 --> 01:44:23,738
Gotta hold on!

1673
01:44:29,912 --> 01:44:31,277
Four Leaf!

1674
01:44:36,018 --> 01:44:37,349
You grew hands?

1675
01:44:46,595 --> 01:44:48,119
RPG, gentlemen!

1676
01:44:50,899 --> 01:44:52,423
Where are you going?

1677
01:44:57,940 --> 01:45:01,042
Oh, my God.
I am moving to catering after this.

1678
01:45:22,497 --> 01:45:23,828
My ass!

1679
01:45:27,069 --> 01:45:28,400
My ass!

1680
01:45:30,005 --> 01:45:33,270
Hey, yo!
We gotta get our shit together, Tugg!

1681
01:45:33,375 --> 01:45:35,671
We gotta get his cracker
ass to the chopper!

1682
01:45:35,711 --> 01:45:40,011
Are you still crazy?
We gotta get Candisky to the chopper!

1683
01:45:40,115 --> 01:45:41,582
It's Sandusky.

1684
01:45:43,452 --> 01:45:46,751
- Kevin Sandusky.
- That's my name.

1685
01:45:46,855 --> 01:45:48,447
You remembered my name.

1686
01:45:48,557 --> 01:45:50,582
Alpa, go help Cody.

1687
01:45:50,692 --> 01:45:52,754
Portnoy, get Sandusky
back to the chopper. Go!

1688
01:45:52,794 --> 01:45:54,625
- I got him!
- Let's go!

1689
01:45:56,064 --> 01:45:57,588
Let's get out of here!

1690
01:46:09,478 --> 01:46:10,968
Hey, Leaf!

1691
01:46:11,079 --> 01:46:12,307
- Leaf!
- Yeah.

1692
01:46:12,414 --> 01:46:13,404
Hit the plunger

1693
01:46:13,515 --> 01:46:16,353
- as soon as they clear the bridge!
- Got it!

1694
01:46:19,955 --> 01:46:22,389
Come on! Get in the chopper!

1695
01:46:22,591 --> 01:46:25,389
- Come on! Move!
- Kirk! Wait!

1696
01:46:29,932 --> 01:46:31,627
Laz, I'm gonna blow the bridge!

1697
01:46:31,667 --> 01:46:33,528
Are you the special effects guy?

1698
01:46:33,568 --> 01:46:36,010
- You God damn right I am.
- Fuck yeah!

1699
01:46:36,104 --> 01:46:37,366
Leaf's about to blow the bridge.
Come on!

1700
01:46:37,406 --> 01:46:40,068
You don't have to! You don't have to!
I'm staying.

1701
01:46:40,108 --> 01:46:41,695
No, I can't let you do that, mate.
We gotta go.

1702
01:46:41,710 --> 01:46:44,306
No, I'm telling you, I'm not being crazy.
They'll listen to me.

1703
01:46:44,346 --> 01:46:46,909
I know it sounds weird, but I
have a connection with them.

1704
01:46:46,949 --> 01:46:49,811
You're not doing tofu dinner theater
for these motherfuckers. Let's roll!

1705
01:46:49,851 --> 01:46:53,685
- Get over here!
- I have a son now. Little Half Squat.

1706
01:46:53,789 --> 01:46:55,417
Who in crikey fuck is Half Squat?

1707
01:46:55,457 --> 01:46:57,687
He's my son. He's my boy!

1708
01:46:57,793 --> 01:47:00,301
He needs me. I have to go back to him.

1709
01:47:03,365 --> 01:47:05,093
You tell the world what happened here.

1710
01:47:05,133 --> 01:47:06,964
What happened here?

1711
01:47:07,069 --> 01:47:09,709
I don't know, but you need to tell them.

1712
01:47:11,673 --> 01:47:13,504
I got this.

1713
01:47:13,608 --> 01:47:14,768
Tugg!

1714
01:47:15,477 --> 01:47:19,038
You take care of the boys!
I'll deal with these guys.

1715
01:47:20,449 --> 01:47:24,044
Where is he going?
We're gonna fucking die!

1716
01:47:24,152 --> 01:47:26,848
Laz, come on. He joined the circus.
Let's go.

1717
01:47:26,888 --> 01:47:28,150
- You've got hands.
- Yeah.

1718
01:47:28,190 --> 01:47:30,434
- Fuck! You've got hands?
- Come on!

1719
01:47:31,393 --> 01:47:32,581
- Come on!
- Get in!

1720
01:47:32,627 --> 01:47:34,254
- Come on!
- He's staying?

1721
01:47:34,363 --> 01:47:37,333
Go! He's a lost cause, mate!
Get out of here!

1722
01:47:41,203 --> 01:47:45,697
I was wrong! Blow the bridge!
Blow the fucking bridge!

1723
01:47:51,546 --> 01:47:52,945
I got this.

1724
01:47:53,615 --> 01:47:55,048
Leaf, no!

1725
01:48:39,194 --> 01:48:41,822
It's over! He's gone!

1726
01:48:41,930 --> 01:48:43,989
Cody! We gotta go!

1727
01:48:46,001 --> 01:48:47,195
Look.

1728
01:49:09,825 --> 01:49:11,156
Think he's done.

1729
01:49:11,259 --> 01:49:12,487
Cover me!

1730
01:49:13,562 --> 01:49:16,497
- Come on!
- Wait, come back!

1731
01:49:16,598 --> 01:49:18,327
How do we cover him?

1732
01:49:22,571 --> 01:49:25,972
All right, game over. Come on, mate.
Come on.

1733
01:49:26,074 --> 01:49:28,668
- You all right, man?
- I'm cold.

1734
01:49:28,777 --> 01:49:30,768
I can't feel my legs.

1735
01:49:30,879 --> 01:49:33,875
No, no, they're in a puddle, mate. See?
There's a puddle right there.

1736
01:49:33,915 --> 01:49:35,169
- No worries.
- Good.

1737
01:49:35,217 --> 01:49:36,578
Come on, we gotta split, man.

1738
01:49:36,618 --> 01:49:38,994
- You guys came back for me.
- Course.

1739
01:49:39,020 --> 01:49:41,352
Hey! I want you to know something.

1740
01:49:41,456 --> 01:49:42,650
What?

1741
01:49:43,825 --> 01:49:45,622
I know who you are.

1742
01:49:47,729 --> 01:49:49,492
You're my friend.

1743
01:49:51,766 --> 01:49:53,393
You're my brother.

1744
01:49:54,269 --> 01:49:57,102
But like a really cool brother, you know?

1745
01:49:57,205 --> 01:49:58,633
Like a brother where there
was no animosity or…

1746
01:49:58,673 --> 01:50:01,570
Don't look now, you got
some real tears going.

1747
01:50:01,610 --> 01:50:02,599
Really?

1748
01:50:02,711 --> 01:50:04,272
That's the stuff that
accolades are made of.

1749
01:50:04,312 --> 01:50:05,779
Jesus, let's go, man!

1750
01:50:05,881 --> 01:50:06,981
All right?

1751
01:50:06,982 --> 01:50:07,642
All right?

1752
01:50:08,917 --> 01:50:10,350
Upsy-daisy.

1753
01:50:12,120 --> 01:50:15,156
Come on! Come on! Come on!
Let's go! Let's go!

1754
01:50:17,259 --> 01:50:18,556
Get in! Get in!

1755
01:50:18,660 --> 01:50:20,685
Come on! Here we go!

1756
01:50:23,231 --> 01:50:26,029
Tuggernuts! I got it!

1757
01:50:28,403 --> 01:50:30,701
- Tugger!
- Rick!

1758
01:50:33,308 --> 01:50:34,536
What the fuck?

1759
01:50:34,643 --> 01:50:36,270
I got the TiVo!

1760
01:50:37,179 --> 01:50:41,582
My friend wants a TiVo,
my friend gets a TiVo!

1761
01:50:46,755 --> 01:50:48,017
Oh, shit!

1762
01:51:24,859 --> 01:51:26,884
<i>And the Oscar goes to…</i>

1763
01:51:29,631 --> 01:51:31,929
<i>Yes! Tugg Speedman.</i>

1764
01:51:33,568 --> 01:51:36,331
“Tropic Blunder, The True
Story Behind the Making

1765
01:51:36,371 --> 01:51:39,539
of the Most Expensive
Fake True War Story Ever.”

1766
01:51:40,475 --> 01:51:41,601
Yeah!

1767
01:51:46,314 --> 01:51:48,214
Yeah, you son of a bitch!

1768
01:52:07,535 --> 01:52:11,904
Eight Oscars, $400 million

1769
01:52:12,007 --> 01:52:15,238
and you saved Tugg Speedman's career.

1770
01:52:15,343 --> 01:52:18,247
I couldn't have done it
without you, Slolom.

1771
01:52:20,248 --> 01:52:21,340
Really?

1772
01:52:21,449 --> 01:52:23,511
No, dickhead, of course I could.

1773
01:52:23,551 --> 01:52:26,281
- A nutless monkey could do your job.
- Well, I…

1774
01:52:26,321 --> 01:52:29,284
Now, go get drunk and take
credit at all the parties.

1775
01:52:29,324 --> 01:52:32,020
- I would never do that to…
- Joking.

1776
01:52:32,127 --> 01:52:33,492
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1777
01:52:33,595 --> 01:52:35,790
Very… Okay, there he is.

1778
01:52:35,897 --> 01:52:37,459
- There he is. Okay.
- Go have fun.

1779
01:52:37,499 --> 01:52:39,094
All right. We're having a…

1780
01:52:39,134 --> 01:52:41,596
Fuck, okay. Thank you, Les.
Thank you. You have a good night…

1781
01:52:41,636 --> 01:52:44,099
But seriously, a nutless
monkey could do your job.

1782
01:52:44,139 --> 01:52:45,868
Good. Thank you, sir.
