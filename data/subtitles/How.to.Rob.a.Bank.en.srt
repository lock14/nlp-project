00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:23,284
<i>Life, as you know it,</i>
<i>is stealing from you.</i>

3
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:27,116
<i>Literally. Minute by minute,</i>
<i>surcharge by surcharge...</i>

4
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:30,094
<i>the ubiquitous convenience of modern</i>
<i>life is bleeding you dry.</i>

5
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:33,158
<i>Nickel by nickel.</i>

6
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:34,997
<i>Chump change.</i>

7
00:00:35,435 --> 00:00:38,427
<i>The dime you don't even bother bending</i>
<i>over to pick up on some sidewalk...</i>

8
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:41,965
<i>is the very same dime you get</i>
<i>"bent-over" for by all these "services."</i>

9
00:00:42,575 --> 00:00:45,294
<i>You call 411,</i>
<i>that'll cost you.50¢.</i>

10
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:48,940
<i>You want to actually PLACE that call,</i>
<i>that'll cost you an additional.49¢.</i>

11
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,849
<i>That adds up</i>
<i>to guys like you and me.</i>

12
00:00:52,152 --> 00:00:55,644
<i>By the end of the week, the day before</i>
<i>payday, I've got 20 bucks to my name.</i>

13
00:00:55,655 --> 00:00:58,112
<i>But don't even think about trying</i>
<i>to withdraw your money.</i>

14
00:00:58,124 --> 00:01:00,513
<i>It cost me $1.50</i>
<i>to get my twenty dollars.</i>

15
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:04,088
<i>I only have $18.50 after the freakin'</i>
<i>ATM takes its cut...</i>

16
00:01:04,097 --> 00:01:08,193
<i>which means I don't have twenty</i>
<i>dollars, I have insufficient funds.</i>

17
00:01:08,701 --> 00:01:10,601
<i>That's why I'm here!</i>

18
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:13,966
<i>Now, listen closely because</i>
<i>I'm about to tell you a secret.</i>

19
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:16,359
<i>How to beat the "system"...</i>

20
00:01:16,376 --> 00:01:18,606
<i>and take charge of</i>
<i>the surcharge in life.</i>

21
00:02:23,276 --> 00:02:25,995
Shit! That hurts! Son of a...

22
00:02:26,012 --> 00:02:28,572
- I couldn't care less you whinny little...
- Whoa there skippy.

23
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:32,108
If I wanted more verbal abuse, I'd call
some customer service center somewhere.

24
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:35,705
Sorry, didn't catch that last part?

25
00:02:35,722 --> 00:02:38,122
Was that, "Sorry for being a bitch...

26
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:40,423
I'll be nice now?"

27
00:02:46,766 --> 00:02:48,324
Ouch! You...

28
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,806
- Ok, let's start over.
- Good idea.

29
00:02:59,579 --> 00:03:00,967
What do you want?

30
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:03,676
- My twenty bucks.
- I think we covered that.

31
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,615
True.

32
00:03:08,221 --> 00:03:10,416
So, what's your name?

33
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:14,082
Jason, Jason Taylor.
People call me Jinx though.

34
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:17,122
What's your name?

35
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:21,233
- Jessica.
- Jessica. Nice name.

36
00:03:22,068 --> 00:03:24,059
You kind of look like a Jessica.

37
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:29,628
- Ok. So... what's next?
- What do you mean?

38
00:03:29,642 --> 00:03:32,372
What are you going to do?

39
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,374
I don't know.

40
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,642
I mean, well, I don't know.

41
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,917
- You don't know?
- No, not exactly.

42
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:42,486
Not exactly?

43
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:46,855
What's next?
What is your next step?

44
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:51,079
i.e. Evaluate. Execute. Exit.

45
00:03:51,097 --> 00:03:53,156
What is your plan?
Have you got a plan?

46
00:03:53,299 --> 00:03:56,791
Did you ever think of devising
a plan in a situation like this?

47
00:03:57,737 --> 00:03:59,193
Maybe you ought to have a plan.

48
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,230
- Oh, boy.
- You know. No! Oh, God...

49
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,983
What's this?

50
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:17,012
Oh, sorry about that.

51
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,758
That's what they call a cell phone.

52
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,956
- Thanks.
- What are you going to do?

53
00:04:30,737 --> 00:04:32,796
- Um, hello?
<i>- Hello?</i>

54
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,601
- Hello.
<i>- Hello.</i>

55
00:04:35,975 --> 00:04:38,375
- Hello? Can you here me?
<i>- Who's this?</i>

56
00:04:40,013 --> 00:04:42,072
- I asked you first.
<i>- Excuse me?</i>

57
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,812
- I said, who is this?
<i>- I heard what you said.</i>

58
00:04:46,152 --> 00:04:49,519
<i>So, who is this,</i>
<i>to whom am I speaking with?</i>

59
00:04:49,656 --> 00:04:53,592
<i>- More importantly, what do you want?</i>
- I don't know.

60
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,188
<i>- You don't know?</i>
- My twenty bucks.

61
00:04:57,463 --> 00:05:01,160
<i>Let's start over,</i>
<i>let's just say my name is Simon.</i>

62
00:05:01,534 --> 00:05:03,024
Ok, good enough for me.

63
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:06,335
So, Simon, what's the deal?
How do we do this?

64
00:05:06,539 --> 00:05:08,131
How do we do this?

65
00:05:09,509 --> 00:05:10,908
Well...

66
00:05:11,444 --> 00:05:15,904
you tell me what you want,
i.e. your demands.

67
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,341
Then I give you what's
called a counter-offer...

68
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:22,951
giving you part of what you want,
but not everything...

69
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:25,914
so I hold a decent
bargaining position...

70
00:05:25,925 --> 00:05:29,725
to deliver what it is I want.
Got it?

71
00:05:30,797 --> 00:05:33,357
<i>- I don't think I like your attitude.</i>
- That 'a boy...

72
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,895
now you're beginning
to get the feel!

73
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:37,961
<i>I want my twenty bucks...</i>

74
00:05:37,970 --> 00:05:40,530
<i>and safely get out of here!</i>

75
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,766
What we have here
is a symbiotic relationship.

76
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:47,208
Now we're cooking 'cause you want out
of there and I'd love to be in there.

77
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:51,116
And in the spirit of negotiation...

78
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,686
I would like to see you dead...

79
00:05:54,654 --> 00:05:56,747
and you'd like to get out safely...

80
00:05:57,056 --> 00:06:01,493
so let's meet in the middle
and just have you come out.

81
00:06:02,595 --> 00:06:06,895
- What do you say? Big boy.
<i>- You're kind of brutally blunt...</i>

82
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:10,260
<i>and to tell you the truth,</i>
<i>it's a bit unsettling.</i>

83
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,097
<i>I'm not so sure about this.</i>

84
00:06:12,105 --> 00:06:14,471
Whatever. Do we have a deal?

85
00:06:14,607 --> 00:06:18,873
<i>I would love to accommodate you,</i>
<i>except the seeing me dead part.</i>

86
00:06:19,579 --> 00:06:22,139
<i>But, I didn't lock this door...</i>

87
00:06:22,148 --> 00:06:24,469
<i>it sealed itself when</i>
<i>the alarm went off...</i>

88
00:06:24,484 --> 00:06:25,576
<i>and I don't know how to open it.</i>

89
00:06:25,585 --> 00:06:27,883
And that's my problem, how?

90
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:31,820
I'm trapped in a vault.

91
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:35,652
I want out! I want...

92
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,656
Mind if I speak with him?

93
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,821
- What?
- Mind if I speak with him?

94
00:06:41,834 --> 00:06:44,098
Yeah, sure,
wait, no, I mean no.

95
00:06:44,504 --> 00:06:47,359
What are you talking about?
You are not running the show.

96
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,638
- I am running the show now.
- Ok. You're running the show.

97
00:06:51,644 --> 00:06:53,839
Simon, he's running the show now.

98
00:06:54,046 --> 00:06:56,514
I said no talking on the phone.

99
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,243
<i>Please tell her everything is fine.</i>

100
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,434
<i>Just wait for now.</i>

101
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:01,682
He says everything is fine, just...

102
00:07:02,054 --> 00:07:04,614
Wait. Everybody hold on a minute!

103
00:07:18,304 --> 00:07:20,431
May I make a suggestion?

104
00:07:22,842 --> 00:07:25,538
Fine. Why not?

105
00:07:26,078 --> 00:07:28,000
Tell him I can open the door...

106
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,436
but you won't allow me...

107
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:32,612
to until he guarantees
you safe passage out.

108
00:07:34,654 --> 00:07:37,646
She can open the door, but...

109
00:07:37,824 --> 00:07:39,689
<i>I heard her. It's a good plan.</i>

110
00:07:39,826 --> 00:07:42,351
<i>I give you my guarantee. 100%.</i>

111
00:07:42,929 --> 00:07:46,456
Hold up here. How can you open this
ten-ton solid steel bank vault door...

112
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,331
and why should I trust you?

113
00:07:48,568 --> 00:07:50,058
See that computer?

114
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:58,434
That particular computer is tied
into the entire security system...

115
00:07:58,444 --> 00:08:01,811
of this and every other branch
of Union Federal...

116
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:04,347
why do you think
it's kept in a vault?

117
00:08:04,684 --> 00:08:08,450
Hey, what am I gonna do to you?
It's not like I've got a gun or anything.

118
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:15,684
Fine.

119
00:09:04,844 --> 00:09:06,766
It's called "exploding noema".

120
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:10,601
It's a theory of psychoanalysis
to describe the exact moment...

121
00:09:10,616 --> 00:09:13,005
when the brain can't
reconcile the difference...

122
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:16,216
between its perception of what should
be versus the reality of what is.

123
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:19,309
Kinda like drinking from what you
thought was one thing...

124
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:21,919
you actually drink
cigarette butts and beer.

125
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:23,247
Well that moment should
be over now...

126
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:27,665
and your brain is facing the reality
that if you get up from that chair...

127
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:31,336
this little gadget of yours will be
lots of little gadget pieces.

128
00:09:38,611 --> 00:09:41,307
Stop!!! Please. Please.

129
00:09:43,683 --> 00:09:46,379
That is our way out of here.
That is our key.

130
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,584
Literally.

131
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:17,309
Ok, now what?

132
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:21,476
We talk. You're a smart
and extremely capable woman.

133
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:28,152
I'd even go so far to say,
a serious force to be reckoned with.

134
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,014
You obviously know
what you are doing.

135
00:10:30,029 --> 00:10:32,247
And I'll be honest, the only
authority I have here...

136
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:36,564
is a stolen Palm Pilot
and a roll of pretty durable tape.

137
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,098
But that's everything
now, isn't it?

138
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:42,999
So, you and I are going to talk.

139
00:10:43,175 --> 00:10:50,206
You're going to give me frank and honest
answers without any attitude. Got it?

140
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:52,678
Yes. I do.

141
00:10:53,252 --> 00:10:54,685
Ok then.

142
00:10:56,155 --> 00:10:57,884
What's this all about?

143
00:10:58,057 --> 00:10:59,581
<i>She doesn't know.</i>

144
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:04,747
- What was that?
<i>- She doesn't know.</i>

145
00:11:04,764 --> 00:11:07,255
<i>She's equipped with the codes, but</i>
<i>isn't briefed on what to do or the plan.</i>

146
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,427
<i>She's a hired gun.</i>

147
00:11:10,269 --> 00:11:12,169
- You're lying.
- No. He's not.

148
00:11:12,605 --> 00:11:15,005
- You're lying.
- No. I'm not.

149
00:11:17,710 --> 00:11:20,178
Ok then, now what?

150
00:11:21,113 --> 00:11:22,944
<i>What you're going to do is...</i>

151
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:29,854
<i>I was saying...</i>

152
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:36,492
<i>Look here you...</i>

153
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:46,070
<i>Ok, please, one moment.</i>

154
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:50,999
<i>Please... let's start over.</i>

155
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:53,338
That's beginning to be
our theme 'round here.

156
00:11:54,346 --> 00:11:56,667
So, shoot. Tell me
what I need to know.

157
00:11:56,682 --> 00:12:00,140
Tell me how I can
get out of this vault...

158
00:12:00,152 --> 00:12:02,245
in a way that serves
my best interest.

159
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:04,119
Namely alive.

160
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:09,526
<i>Ok, there are key codes stored</i>
<i>in the Palm Pilot...</i>

161
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,126
<i>that's rather precariously</i>
<i>in your possession.</i>

162
00:12:14,233 --> 00:12:18,067
The codes are for the computer terminal
locked inside the vault with you...

163
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:22,097
<i>and on that computer,</i>
<i>with the correct code...</i>

164
00:12:22,108 --> 00:12:25,236
is the central electronic automatic
locking control for the vault door.

165
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,666
And the master lock-release...

166
00:12:28,681 --> 00:12:31,809
for every safety-deposit box
you see around you.

167
00:12:32,184 --> 00:12:35,711
That a' boy, now we're cooking
with gasoline.

168
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,254
Was that so hard? I mean really.

169
00:12:41,627 --> 00:12:43,254
Yes. Yes, it was actually.

170
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:44,854
Shake it off Simon.

171
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:48,592
Now that we're a little better informed
with a bit of an attitude adjustment...

172
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:51,798
let's revisit my original question.

173
00:12:52,304 --> 00:12:53,862
How do we do this?

174
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:55,404
Not bad.

175
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:59,169
- Excuse me?
- The way you played that. Not bad.

176
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,799
Do you think I laid it
on too thick there in the end?

177
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,600
- You blew it.
- I thought you just said...

178
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:05,299
I know I did, but then you blew it.

179
00:13:05,317 --> 00:13:07,649
I'm sorry, what's that?

180
00:13:08,053 --> 00:13:11,716
I mean, could you feel it?
That moment?

181
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:15,618
You had life by the balls.
You were in charge.

182
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,063
Hey Simon. I'm gonna have
to call you back.

183
00:13:20,866 --> 00:13:24,267
You see! There, again.
The spark. Living life!

184
00:13:24,703 --> 00:13:27,331
You, just then. Hanging up.
You just did it.

185
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:32,676
Seriously. I mean that's how life
gets the better of us.

186
00:13:33,045 --> 00:13:36,105
It ends up running rough-shod
over us in small doses.

187
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:38,436
For example,
why pay $1.50...

188
00:13:38,450 --> 00:13:40,304
to have access to
your twenty bucks? Screw 'em!

189
00:13:40,319 --> 00:13:42,150
Exactly!

190
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,483
Think about it. They put
in an ATM machine...

191
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:50,322
basically does the work of, I dunno,
dozen people or more per branch.

192
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,092
And?

193
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:54,025
So, the bank lays these people off...

194
00:13:54,033 --> 00:13:56,024
saving entire years worth of salary...

195
00:13:56,035 --> 00:13:59,232
for dozens of people per bank,
per machine...

196
00:13:59,371 --> 00:14:01,327
not to mention the money saved...

197
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,160
not paying these people's
insurance, benefits...

198
00:14:03,175 --> 00:14:07,976
bonuses, pension,
welfare, taxes, nothing.

199
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,644
- Yeah?
- And for all this profit...

200
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,669
they have the audacity
to charge us $1.50...

201
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,711
every time we use their
machine for our money.

202
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:19,179
- And it doesn't stop there. Surcharges...
- Yeah.

203
00:14:19,358 --> 00:14:20,677
- Service charges...
- Yeah.

204
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:25,027
Late fees, roaming fees...
Nickel and diming us to death.

205
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:28,416
I mean, "Roaming fees" in addition
to your phone bill on cell phones...

206
00:14:28,434 --> 00:14:30,686
that are meant to roam?

207
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:33,194
That's why they call
them "mobile phones," right?

208
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,570
And late fees on DVDs that cost more
than it would to just buy the movie!

209
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,268
Crime by any other name.

210
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:42,679
It is a crime.
A crime of convenience.

211
00:14:43,249 --> 00:14:47,777
We're in a state of
financial emergency!

212
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,883
- Hello?
<i>- This is 911 Emergency.</i>

213
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:53,320
Hey, it's me, I'm the one who
called just over a half-hour ago.

214
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,454
<i>I'm ok, but I'm still locked</i>
<i>in the bank vault.</i>

215
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:41,535
Brian DeGepse here.

216
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:42,991
<i>This is 911 Emergency...</i>

217
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,499
<i>dispatch ready to patch</i>
<i>you through, officer.</i>

218
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,843
Go for DeGepse.

219
00:15:48,747 --> 00:15:52,148
This is Brian DeGepse, commanding
officer, Emergency Response unit...

220
00:15:52,351 --> 00:15:55,616
- who am I speaking with?
<i>- Jason Taylor, sir.</i>

221
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:59,151
Alright Mr. Taylor, first,
I've been briefed...

222
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:02,093
but I need to know if
you are still safe and secure.

223
00:16:02,594 --> 00:16:04,255
You could say I'm safe.

224
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:06,015
Now, outline the situation, please.

225
00:16:06,031 --> 00:16:09,831
I'm safe because I'm IN the safe.

226
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,165
I got the joke. Sir.

227
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:17,808
I don't want to alarm you in any way,
but this is not a laughing matter...

228
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:20,137
<i>there's nothing funny...</i>

229
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,872
I'm sorry, did you just say,
"there's nothing funny...

230
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:26,281
about he sit onion?"

231
00:16:26,552 --> 00:16:29,783
Excuse me?
Don't mess with me Mr. Taylor.

232
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,093
Yes, I can hear you.

233
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:43,000
<i>Can you... ear... me... ow?</i>

234
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:46,928
Ear what? Oh, hear you? No.

235
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,098
Can you hear me now?

236
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:52,467
<i>Look, find the spot with</i>
<i>the best reception...</i>

237
00:16:52,478 --> 00:16:54,912
- Sorry.
- And don't move. Hear me?

238
00:16:55,381 --> 00:16:56,678
I can't...

239
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,377
<i>Look for a good zone.</i>
<i>I'll do that.</i>

240
00:16:59,618 --> 00:17:01,609
- What d'ya got?
- The guy is nobody.

241
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,817
Couple a parking tickets,
a DUI on a scooter...

242
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:08,557
- and he works at Starbucks.
- Right.

243
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:12,556
<i>- Can you still hear me?</i>
- Ok, I think I've got a good spot.

244
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,553
<i>Hello? Are you ok?</i>
<i>Do we have any injuries?</i>

245
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,403
<i>I think we may have a fatality if</i>
<i>someone doesn't get his ass off me!</i>

246
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,734
Fine. Fine. Everything's fine!

247
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,779
Nothing to see here.
Move it along.

248
00:17:28,414 --> 00:17:29,904
I swear to God, I'll kill you...

249
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:32,042
with my hands tied behind
my back if you don't stop right now.

250
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:34,884
<i>Is your safety compromised,</i>
<i>are you in danger?!</i>

251
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,705
I've been "compromised" alright,
but he's the only one in danger!

252
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,191
Who the hell is that
and what's going on?!

253
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:43,647
I just had
to subdue the hostage sir.

254
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:47,291
Hostage? Who in the hell
do you have hostage and why?

255
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,920
<i>She's one of "them"sir and I
<i>didn't mean to take her hostage...</i>

256
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:51,687
<i>she was in here</i>
<i>when I ran for cover.</i>

257
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:54,092
<i>So, I forcibly</i>
<i>subdued her into custody...</i>

258
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:56,028
<i>and that's when the vault door</i>
<i>automatically closed on us.</i>

259
00:17:56,041 --> 00:17:56,700
<i>What a crock.</i>

260
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,437
<i>That's a...</i>

261
00:17:58,777 --> 00:17:59,869
<i>Hey that's...</i>

262
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:04,235
<i>yu... ear... me now?</i>

263
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,114
I'm not buying that. At all.

264
00:18:07,119 --> 00:18:10,088
<i>- In fact, that was pathetic.</i>
- Really?

265
00:18:11,023 --> 00:18:15,016
Try crinkling a paper bag over the
mouth piece next time. Works great...

266
00:18:15,561 --> 00:18:17,461
So, what's the situation?

267
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:20,884
We're fine, unless you count being
locked in a vault...

268
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:22,321
with armed
assholes outside the door.

269
00:18:22,334 --> 00:18:25,269
- Excuse me?
- No, I didn't mean YOU people.

270
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:26,901
Excuse me?

271
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:34,710
Please don't tell me you're black
or something. I'd never, I...

272
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:39,440
I am.

273
00:18:42,921 --> 00:18:45,287
May I speak with him this time?

274
00:18:51,864 --> 00:18:53,798
- Hello?
<i>- Yeah? Hello.</i>

275
00:18:54,466 --> 00:18:59,233
You're going to have to forgive my
friend here. He's confused.

276
00:18:59,771 --> 00:19:01,602
Just an innocent mistake.

277
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:03,638
He's really quite a sweet guy...

278
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,175
but he's having a really bad day.

279
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:08,637
You know those days?

280
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:11,810
I understand. This is a
stressful situation...

281
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:14,468
for any civilian, mam.

282
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,874
I've seen it all before.

283
00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:19,949
I am sure you have.
Your job must be fascinating!

284
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,561
Well... excuse me Miss,
who exactly are you?

285
00:19:23,862 --> 00:19:26,820
You see, there's been a huge
misunderstanding...

286
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,721
You see I was accessing
my safety-deposit box...

287
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:31,726
when the alarm went off...

288
00:19:31,737 --> 00:19:35,070
I was so frightened
and flustered...

289
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:37,734
when Jinx here ran in and...

290
00:19:37,876 --> 00:19:39,639
Wait...

291
00:19:40,279 --> 00:19:42,941
<i>- Who the hell is Jinx?</i>
- That'd be me, sir.

292
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:44,434
Please, continue.

293
00:19:44,449 --> 00:19:46,804
<i>So, in the ensuing confusion...</i>

294
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:49,719
Jinx here mistook me for being
a part of the hold up...

295
00:19:49,988 --> 00:19:54,152
did what a good man does
and took control of the situation.

296
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,514
But, we've cleared that up now...

297
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:01,329
and just want out of this awful vault
as soon as you can help us.

298
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:05,152
Ok miss, just hang in there.
Help is in progress.

299
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:06,660
Thanks.

300
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,131
I'm going to have
to call you back...

301
00:20:11,143 --> 00:20:12,872
<i>I think we're running</i>
<i>low on batteries.</i>

302
00:20:15,814 --> 00:20:17,907
So, what are you going to do?

303
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:55,647
<i>Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!</i>

304
00:21:01,593 --> 00:21:04,027
How's it going?

305
00:21:05,664 --> 00:21:08,292
Not good. Not very good.
Not good at all.

306
00:21:09,334 --> 00:21:13,668
I'm talking impasse, a serious
catch-22, a "Mexican stand-off."

307
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:15,796
Basically... We're fucked!

308
00:21:17,542 --> 00:21:21,069
How's that Allexor working out?

309
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:27,242
I dunno.
Prozac, XENIX, Wilburton...

310
00:21:27,252 --> 00:21:29,777
just another serotonin
up-take inhibitor.

311
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:34,956
My doc thinks this'll work better...
I don't think it's working at all.

312
00:21:36,395 --> 00:21:39,831
In fact, it's got me a touch speedy.

313
00:21:41,166 --> 00:21:45,500
No worries, the "situation"
is in hand.

314
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:47,098
Okay.

315
00:21:47,873 --> 00:21:50,933
- Which situation?
- Never mind.

316
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:53,333
Go watch the guard.

317
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:57,805
Do you mind having a look
at my gun first?

318
00:21:59,017 --> 00:22:00,473
- What?
- My gun.

319
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:03,045
I think it's jammed again.
I took apart the clip-Ioader...

320
00:22:03,055 --> 00:22:04,477
firing pin,
and reassembled the repeater...

321
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,741
But it's still jamming.

322
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:09,488
- And then you know...
- Just, go pretend to guard the guard.

323
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,759
No problem. Will do.

324
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,669
Shit.

325
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,939
It's about time!

326
00:22:28,013 --> 00:22:29,844
Thank you...

327
00:22:29,981 --> 00:22:32,506
that tape was really
beginning to kill my wrists.

328
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,678
I always keep my end of the deal.
A show of good faith, right?

329
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,755
So, what are we going to do here?

330
00:22:42,594 --> 00:22:44,619
I don't know,
what are we going to do?

331
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,589
Seems like we're both
living now, huh?

332
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:51,027
A bit on the edge... for me.

333
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:55,395
But I gotta admit,
I kind of like the view.

334
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,364
Living?

335
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:02,441
What is it that you live to do?

336
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:06,783
As far as I can tell, this is it.

337
00:23:08,787 --> 00:23:12,177
You don't always get to choose the
monumental moments in your life.

338
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:13,987
They choose you.

339
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:17,493
And when they do,
you take what you can get.

340
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:28,304
- Hello.
<i>- Hello.</i>

341
00:23:28,673 --> 00:23:31,597
- Hello.
<i>- Hello, can you hear...</i>

342
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:34,010
- Yeah, I was just saying hello.
<i>- Funny.</i>

343
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:36,740
- Not really.
<i>- What the fuck's going on?</i>

344
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:38,713
He's got the codes.

345
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:40,579
<i>Okay. How about you?</i>

346
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:43,354
I'm tied up.

347
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:55,730
So, here's what you're going to do.

348
00:23:55,834 --> 00:23:58,052
You're gonna get me
safe passage out of here.

349
00:23:58,069 --> 00:24:00,435
We'll talk terms later.

350
00:24:05,177 --> 00:24:07,236
A show of good faith right?

351
00:24:11,416 --> 00:24:14,112
I always keep my end of the deal.

352
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,779
What are you gonna do now?

353
00:24:19,825 --> 00:24:21,759
- I think I just did it.
- Yeah?

354
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:25,557
Yeah.

355
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:38,171
Officer DeGepse here.
How're you two holding up?

356
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:43,103
<i>I'm not holding up anything.</i>
<i>That'd be the guys outside the vault.</i>

357
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:48,618
Okay, then, what's your status?

358
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,345
<i>I think my status and your status</i>
<i>are the same status.</i>

359
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:53,677
<i>Sort of stuck in a status.</i>

360
00:24:53,692 --> 00:24:55,319
<i>Still locked in a vault.</i>
<i>Unable to get out.</i>

361
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,716
<i>Surrounded by armed robbers</i>
<i>who would love to get in.</i>

362
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:00,050
<i>Even if they could get into the</i>
<i>vault, they certainly can't get out...</i>

363
00:25:00,065 --> 00:25:03,193
<i>because they're surrounded by you</i>
<i>who would love to throw them in prison.</i>

364
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:05,726
<i>Which I don't think</i>
<i>is part of their plan.</i>

365
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:07,500
<i>That seem about right to you, sir?</i>

366
00:25:07,839 --> 00:25:08,863
Fuck!

367
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,066
Yeah, that sounds right.

368
00:25:12,711 --> 00:25:16,067
Well, hang in there,
while we continue to try...

369
00:25:16,081 --> 00:25:18,072
to establish communications
with the suspects.

370
00:25:18,083 --> 00:25:19,243
<i>You want help?</i>

371
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,902
Thank you but we have
the matter well in hand.

372
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,740
<i>Do you have their phone number?</i>

373
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:27,816
No. They usually try
to establish contact with us...

374
00:25:27,826 --> 00:25:30,454
some time around this point.

375
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,027
<i>Maybe you should just call them.</i>

376
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:35,265
Thank you for your advice...

377
00:25:36,167 --> 00:25:39,967
but we'll have to wait for them
to communicate with us.

378
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:41,828
- Okay?
<i>- All right...</i>

379
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:44,866
<i>but if you need the numberjust</i>
<i>holler and I'll give it to you.</i>

380
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,718
<i>I saw them leaving.</i>

381
00:26:01,626 --> 00:26:04,424
<i>Not anything particular</i>
<i>Not suspicious.</i>

382
00:26:06,331 --> 00:26:08,925
<i>It's just that... he...</i>

383
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:12,692
What was that?

384
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:15,768
It's just... he was kind of hot.

385
00:26:17,809 --> 00:26:20,004
Any new developments?

386
00:26:20,712 --> 00:26:22,270
Right.

387
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:31,715
<i>Hello. DeGepse again.</i>

388
00:26:31,923 --> 00:26:36,053
- Hey, there, what's up?
- You said you have their phone number?

389
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,256
Yes. Yes, sir.
That's affirmative, sir.

390
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,058
You want it now?

391
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:48,369
Yes. That would be helpful.

392
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:52,510
- You got a pen, pencil?
<i>- Just give me the number.</i>

393
00:26:53,612 --> 00:26:55,796
Uh, it's 367-9389.

394
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:57,805
337-9389. Got it.

395
00:26:58,016 --> 00:27:02,715
<i>No, no, no. It's 367-9389.</i>

396
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:04,850
It's a six...

397
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:07,719
310 area code. Ask for Simon.

398
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:10,258
Simon. That's his name?

399
00:27:10,662 --> 00:27:14,655
I asked the same exact question.
I think he's using a fake name.

400
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,165
We're not too worried
about that right now, are we?

401
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,566
I guess not.

402
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,067
Yeah. Anyway, ask for Simon.
Tell him Jinx gave you the number.

403
00:27:25,510 --> 00:27:27,137
I'll do that.

404
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:34,114
Fuck.

405
00:27:34,552 --> 00:27:36,076
I saw that.

406
00:27:38,657 --> 00:27:41,285
That is why I got a good look at him.

407
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:45,793
- Distinguishing features?
- Don't you have something better to do?

408
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:51,558
He's calling Simon.
Keep him busy for a while.

409
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:53,867
Good. We can use that time.

410
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:58,004
So what's the deal?
What's they key to all this?

411
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,209
You know, what is it?

412
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:03,403
Well, first of all,
it's not keys, it's codes.

413
00:28:04,749 --> 00:28:06,273
That's the deal.

414
00:28:06,618 --> 00:28:08,506
I thought I was getting
the hang of this.

415
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:11,455
I didn't exactly major
in felony philosophy.

416
00:28:12,057 --> 00:28:15,993
Okay. Well, you see all these
safety deposit boxes.

417
00:28:17,662 --> 00:28:20,483
<i>Each one belongs</i>
<i>to an individual bank customer.</i>

418
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:24,958
<i>Not the typical sentimental valuables,</i>
<i>love letters, or some kids Play Do art.</i>

419
00:28:25,203 --> 00:28:26,898
<i>This is a central bank.</i>

420
00:28:26,905 --> 00:28:30,170
<i>They hold all the shit people</i>
<i>want to keep safe.</i>

421
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:31,900
The only problem is...

422
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:36,674
you have to individually break in
to every to box to get the contents.

423
00:28:38,183 --> 00:28:39,707
Well, we've got a choice.

424
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:42,376
We can try and physically
break into every box...

425
00:28:42,387 --> 00:28:44,548
or we can electronically
break into one box.

426
00:28:49,861 --> 00:28:51,123
Right.

427
00:28:54,499 --> 00:28:56,558
Hey, whoa there. Chatty.

428
00:28:56,935 --> 00:29:00,189
Professor Felony...

429
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:03,003
giving a master's lock lecture.

430
00:29:03,508 --> 00:29:05,476
You care to elaborate a bit.

431
00:29:06,277 --> 00:29:09,303
- We have our ways.
- And what way would that be?

432
00:29:10,048 --> 00:29:13,176
- Ways.
- Ways? Just ways?

433
00:29:13,518 --> 00:29:16,112
Yeah, I'm feeling
pretty confident now.

434
00:29:16,521 --> 00:29:18,876
- We just got 'em, okay?
- No, it's not okay.

435
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:20,790
It's not okay at all.

436
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:25,424
This so solid plan of yours,
it just went south. Didn't it?

437
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:28,290
I am being held hostage in a vault...

438
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,151
conspiring to do God knows...

439
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:34,036
what with my captor-slash-you know,
partner. Whatever you are.

440
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,991
I don't what I'm doing. I don't even
know what I'm partners in...

441
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:39,909
except sharing a locked vault.

442
00:29:42,113 --> 00:29:44,001
Don't "huh" with me. I'm
supposed to be the "huh" guy.

443
00:29:44,015 --> 00:29:47,451
I'm supposed to be the one who's
clueless about how to rob a bank not you.

444
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:51,688
My end of the deal was to get
your ass out of here. Your alibi.

445
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:53,950
And, if you haven't noticed...

446
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:56,552
we're a far cry from two
city blocks out of this mess.

447
00:29:56,561 --> 00:30:00,122
Which just so happens to be the
missing part of your full-proof plan.

448
00:30:00,431 --> 00:30:03,150
In return, you provide a wealth
of criminal knowledge...

449
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:06,660
from your B.A. degree
in Bachelor of Armed Robbery.

450
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:10,471
So that's the deal. And if that's not
the deal, then we have no deal.

451
00:30:11,042 --> 00:30:13,670
So, deal with it.

452
00:30:18,049 --> 00:30:19,539
You hungry?

453
00:30:20,585 --> 00:30:25,079
I was stopping to get a bite
and I stopped at the ATM.

454
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:30,523
My twenty bucks.

455
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:38,562
Sweetie, you must
be running on fumes by now.

456
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:44,302
Yeah. I... I am, thank you.

457
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:48,011
Now, seriously,
where did you get the codes?

458
00:30:48,213 --> 00:30:50,306
Come on. Where did they come from?

459
00:30:50,782 --> 00:30:53,546
Seriously?
Seriously, I don't know.

460
00:30:54,085 --> 00:30:57,486
- How does that work?
- I'm just a hired gun...

461
00:30:59,791 --> 00:31:01,918
The codes were texted to Simon...

462
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:04,087
and they were beamed to my phone.

463
00:31:04,629 --> 00:31:09,225
Who texted? You mean someone
else sent the codes?

464
00:31:09,968 --> 00:31:13,062
Some guy.
It's all very anonymous these days.

465
00:31:13,071 --> 00:31:15,528
It's the best way to
do business. You know, it's safe.

466
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,259
If you don't know anything about them.
They don't know anything about you.

467
00:31:18,276 --> 00:31:19,971
You can't turn each other in.

468
00:31:19,978 --> 00:31:22,242
We're freelancers. Temps, of sorts.

469
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,140
You sound like you just
answered a help wanted ad.

470
00:31:25,149 --> 00:31:27,834
It's exactly like you answered
a help wanted ad.

471
00:31:27,852 --> 00:31:29,683
Off the Internet actually.

472
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:33,015
What do you think half those useless
blogs are really about?

473
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:34,616
You need somebody to do a job...

474
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:36,287
you need plausible deniability.

475
00:31:36,294 --> 00:31:38,888
You post a topic.
Pre-arranged site.

476
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,990
Seemingly meaningless, random.

477
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:44,218
You don't think we're a bunch
of disorganized thugs...

478
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,203
in a hideaway, do you?

479
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,256
No, I guess I never really
thought about it.

480
00:31:49,274 --> 00:31:52,698
Exactly. Who's going to monitor the
Duran Duran fan forum chat room...

481
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,201
when there's real crime
out on the streets.

482
00:31:55,713 --> 00:31:58,648
Did you just say Duran Duran?

483
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:00,342
Yep.

484
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:04,620
Why not Zepplin?

485
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:08,576
Everybody Zepplin is a forum
for CIA counter-terrorism.

486
00:32:08,593 --> 00:32:12,814
You gotta be kidding me.
Zepplin are spooks...

487
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:17,119
and Duran Duran are an eighties,
pretty-boy...

488
00:32:17,135 --> 00:32:19,968
bad ass crime syndicate?
That is just not right.

489
00:32:20,571 --> 00:32:24,837
No, it's absolutely true.
If someone posts "Looking for...

490
00:32:25,209 --> 00:32:26,597
<i>"A View To Kill,"...</i>

491
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:29,171
that means "Assassin Wanted."

492
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,343
If someone posts
"Are You Hungry Like the Wolf"...

493
00:32:33,184 --> 00:32:36,176
that means hired hands for a bank job.

494
00:32:38,022 --> 00:32:39,239
And so on.

495
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:41,452
So you're saying Duran Duran...

496
00:32:41,693 --> 00:32:45,049
is at the center of an international
crime syndicate.

497
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:48,760
I seriously doubt Nick Rhodes or
Simon Le Bon are actually involved...

498
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,665
But it's not a bad place to hide,
now is it?

499
00:32:53,204 --> 00:32:54,899
Did you just say "Simon"?

500
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:57,668
Yeah, see. I told you.

501
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,403
- This is weird.
- Not really.

502
00:33:01,412 --> 00:33:05,644
I mean, forget about
porn sites and dot coms.

503
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:08,347
Crime really is what pays.

504
00:33:08,619 --> 00:33:10,337
And the Internet business
is booming.

505
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:12,414
You just can't buy a stock,
you have to steal it.

506
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:15,392
Okay, fine. Whatever.
But why Duran Duran?

507
00:33:16,461 --> 00:33:17,792
Why?

508
00:33:18,563 --> 00:33:20,292
Why not? Anyway.

509
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:25,266
Anyway. Simon gets the codes.
We get in here.

510
00:33:25,536 --> 00:33:28,061
They hold the place down while
I do my computer work.

511
00:33:28,072 --> 00:33:30,427
The boxes are open. We grab and go.

512
00:33:30,441 --> 00:33:33,763
So the guy who sent
the codes gets a cut, huh?

513
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:35,575
It's almost civil really.

514
00:33:35,947 --> 00:33:38,836
Exchange a few numbers
for a percentage.

515
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:41,478
It's just a surcharge
of a different name, I guess.

516
00:33:41,486 --> 00:33:45,820
Well, this particular guy
just wanted a PIN number.

517
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:48,849
PIN number?

518
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:51,985
All I want to know
is who gave you my number...

519
00:33:51,996 --> 00:33:53,782
<i>That's not important right now.</i>

520
00:33:53,798 --> 00:33:56,619
<i>What's important is the safety</i>
<i>of the people you have inside.</i>

521
00:33:56,634 --> 00:33:59,489
<i>Us safely resolving</i>
<i>this situation.</i>

522
00:33:59,504 --> 00:34:02,064
Whatever.
Jinx gave them up, didn't he?

523
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,060
<i>I'm sorry, I don't know</i>
<i>what you're talking about.</i>

524
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:09,206
Cut the crap! That little punk
gave you my cell number. I know it.

525
00:34:09,447 --> 00:34:11,938
<i>I really don't know what</i>
<i>you're talking about.</i>

526
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:15,714
Do you think I'm an idiot, huh?

527
00:34:16,454 --> 00:34:18,809
<i>You're going to tell me you</i>
<i>triangulated my cell phone number...</i>

528
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:23,283
without knowing my TTY frequency
or even carrier for that matter?

529
00:34:24,362 --> 00:34:27,729
Just admit it!
Jinx gave you my number.

530
00:34:28,933 --> 00:34:32,061
You're only on the line because
it's the only move you've got.

531
00:34:32,703 --> 00:34:36,195
You can't resolve the situation.
And worse yet, worse yet...

532
00:34:36,974 --> 00:34:41,809
a civilian knows more about
what's going on then you do.

533
00:34:42,447 --> 00:34:44,381
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

534
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:49,241
Under no circumstances...

535
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:52,017
am I authorized to disclose
that information.

536
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:56,158
But I'd be happy to exchange myself
for a safe hostage release.

537
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:59,686
Then we can discuss
this matter further.

538
00:35:21,452 --> 00:35:23,374
- My God!
- What the hell was that?

539
00:35:23,387 --> 00:35:25,742
Glock 19 semiautomatic.
That's not good.

540
00:35:25,756 --> 00:35:27,485
- You can't.
- Oh, you're right.

541
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:33,420
Listen, listen.

542
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:37,517
Let's take this down
a few notches all right?

543
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:39,435
That get your attention, officer?

544
00:35:39,871 --> 00:35:42,396
<i>Listen, I hear you.</i>

545
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,998
Now, I said...

546
00:35:46,177 --> 00:35:50,375
I said tell me
who gave you this number!

547
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:53,648
If you want to see...
Fuck! Hold on.

548
00:35:53,784 --> 00:35:55,752
We're holding.

549
00:35:56,053 --> 00:35:57,270
We're holding.
No one's doing anything.

550
00:35:57,288 --> 00:35:59,586
No, I mean hold on I got another
call coming in.

551
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:02,285
Hello.

552
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:05,386
- What the hell was that?
<i>- That wake you up, did it?</i>

553
00:36:05,530 --> 00:36:07,657
You shut it. I'm the one asking
the questions here.

554
00:36:07,665 --> 00:36:09,519
If you ever want inside
here and me out...

555
00:36:09,534 --> 00:36:11,525
you're gonna tell me
what the hell that was.

556
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:13,299
That was a Glock...

557
00:36:15,439 --> 00:36:17,691
Your phone just broke up on me.
I missed that last part.

558
00:36:17,708 --> 00:36:20,165
Don't even start getting
attitude with me.

559
00:36:20,178 --> 00:36:22,942
I happen to know exactly
what kind of gun that was.

560
00:36:23,414 --> 00:36:25,473
I want to know what's going on.

561
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:26,882
That was me.

562
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,369
Fuck! I don't think that was me.

563
00:36:29,387 --> 00:36:31,651
I think you've got a call coming in.

564
00:36:32,323 --> 00:36:36,259
I do. Hold on. Hello.

565
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:38,313
We heard gun shots.
Is everyone all right?

566
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:39,990
<i>Yeah, we're fine in here.</i>
<i>I don't know about outside.</i>

567
00:36:39,997 --> 00:36:41,624
<i>I'm trying to find out.</i>

568
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:44,897
What? Are you talking to Simon?

569
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:46,754
Yeah, he's on the other line.

570
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,864
Aren't you supposed to be
on the phone with Simon?

571
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:52,001
I am. I was. I'm on hold.

572
00:36:52,777 --> 00:36:54,233
Hold on a second. I'll flash you in.

573
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:55,872
<i>No, no, that's not a good idea.</i>

574
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:58,303
- Simon, are you still there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

575
00:36:58,316 --> 00:36:59,840
Great. Hold on.

576
00:37:02,086 --> 00:37:05,055
- Hello.
- DeGepse here.

577
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,823
I think everyone's on the line.
Is everyone here?

578
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,857
- Here.
- I'm here.

579
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:13,053
All right. I think we should
all try to work together here.

580
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:15,319
And work on some issues, okay?

581
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,164
- I think that...
- I think we...

582
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:19,069
- I think that...
- I think we...

583
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:21,637
Come on guys.
Don't get shy now.

584
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:24,865
Simon, is there something
you wanted to say to the officer?

585
00:37:24,875 --> 00:37:25,569
I'm sorry.

586
00:37:25,576 --> 00:37:27,294
You see, Officer DeGepse,
Simon says he's sorry.

587
00:37:27,311 --> 00:37:29,939
- Wait. I didn't mean...
- Simon, shut it.

588
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:32,848
Officer DeGepse, do you
accept Simon's apology?

589
00:37:33,684 --> 00:37:35,675
- Officer Degepse?
- Yes?

590
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:39,912
Good, you see. Simon apologized
and the officer graciously accepts.

591
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:40,948
No. No.

592
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:43,477
Wait!

593
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:44,882
As long as we're making progress...

594
00:37:44,895 --> 00:37:47,090
I say we move ahead
and release a few hostages...

595
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:48,520
just as a show of good faith.

596
00:37:48,532 --> 00:37:51,968
I will gladly nominate myself just
to get the ball rolling.

597
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:53,056
What do you guys say?

598
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:56,392
Now wait just a second.
There's ways to do this.

599
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:59,706
No, I think it's a good idea.
I'm all for it.

600
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:16,057
Who is that?

601
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,893
I don't know. Aren't you on the phone
with everybody who's anybody around here?

602
00:38:20,164 --> 00:38:23,156
- What does the Caller ID say?
- I don't have Caller ID.

603
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:26,532
Answer it. Wait, wait, wait.
Just a second.

604
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:29,266
Hello.

605
00:38:31,342 --> 00:38:32,798
Hello? Is anybody there?

606
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,574
<i>- Who is this?</i>
- You're the one who called. Who is this?

607
00:38:39,784 --> 00:38:41,183
Who was it?

608
00:38:41,385 --> 00:38:43,751
I don't know. Wrong number, I guess.

609
00:38:49,827 --> 00:38:50,885
Hello?

610
00:38:51,862 --> 00:38:53,056
Hello?

611
00:38:55,066 --> 00:38:58,297
Okay, he just hung up on me twice.
That's just rude.

612
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:01,003
<i>Hello. Hello?</i>

613
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:02,972
<i>Are you still there?</i>

614
00:39:03,674 --> 00:39:06,609
Hey, guys, I'm gonna have
to call you back, okay?

615
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:09,238
Just keep chatting amongst yourselves.

616
00:39:12,149 --> 00:39:13,309
So?

617
00:39:13,818 --> 00:39:15,149
Hey, don't look at me.

618
00:39:20,991 --> 00:39:22,458
All right, then.

619
00:39:24,829 --> 00:39:27,263
<i>Nick here. What's taking so long?</i>

620
00:39:27,431 --> 00:39:29,717
Hey, it's the guy you
keep hanging up on.

621
00:39:29,734 --> 00:39:32,498
<i>- Shit.</i>
- So, your name's Nick, huh?

622
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:34,669
<i>Maybe.</i>

623
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,269
- Well, is it?
<i>- No.</i>

624
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:42,076
Oh, weird, total Deja vú right now.

625
00:39:43,981 --> 00:39:50,181
Never mind. So, uh. Are you
Jessica's boyfriend or something?

626
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:53,312
<i>Look. I have no idea</i>
<i>what you're talking about.</i>

627
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,053
<i>You have the wrong number.</i>

628
00:39:55,192 --> 00:39:57,888
- You called me.
<i>- Right, then.</i>

629
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:02,763
<i>Uh, I had the wrong number.</i>
<i>Sorry to trouble you. Bye.</i>

630
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,825
<i>Hey, stop calling me.</i>

631
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:12,399
- No.
<i>- What?</i>

632
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,071
No. I said, no.

633
00:40:14,478 --> 00:40:16,378
<i>You can't just say no.</i>

634
00:40:16,714 --> 00:40:22,778
Yes, I can. No. You see?
No. No. No, no, no...

635
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,284
<i>Who are you?</i>

636
00:40:24,488 --> 00:40:27,343
I'm glad you asked. Jason Taylor.
People call me Jinx.

637
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,986
So it seems like I've taken
the first step.

638
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:31,894
"I'm on a hunt down after you."

639
00:40:33,998 --> 00:40:35,795
Nick. Nick Rhodes.

640
00:40:35,966 --> 00:40:38,560
<i>What's going on here? Who are you?</i>

641
00:40:38,736 --> 00:40:42,069
<i>What do you know? How do you know?</i>
<i>What's the deal?</i>

642
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:46,235
That's been my theme ever since
I locked myself in this fricking vault.

643
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:49,542
<i>You? You're in the vault?</i>

644
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:53,177
Yeah, that's what I said.
Am I getting bad cell reception?

645
00:40:53,484 --> 00:40:56,908
I know a spot up in the corner
if you really want me to go up there.

646
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:58,650
<i>Who are you?</i>

647
00:40:58,889 --> 00:41:03,349
Jinx. And I think we've covered that.
Who are you? Nick.

648
00:41:04,228 --> 00:41:05,388
<i>God!</i>

649
00:41:06,263 --> 00:41:07,093
What?

650
00:41:08,666 --> 00:41:09,633
What?

651
00:41:09,767 --> 00:41:12,235
He did it again.
I hate this guy.

652
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:18,105
If I see your men any closer
than twenty-five yards...

653
00:41:18,943 --> 00:41:21,070
I'm putting holes in these
walking body bags.

654
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:22,602
<i>I hear you. I hear you.</i>

655
00:41:23,447 --> 00:41:26,814
<i>Excuse me, but I think you'd better</i>
<i>answer that. It could be Jinx.</i>

656
00:41:27,785 --> 00:41:30,219
Yeah, yeah, You're right. Hold on.

657
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:33,616
Hello, Jinx. How's it going?

658
00:41:34,225 --> 00:41:36,557
I think we're making real
progress out here.

659
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,093
Hey, Jinxy. Is that you?

660
00:41:41,732 --> 00:41:46,897
<i>Is there anything you might want</i>
<i>to tell or say to me?</i>

661
00:41:57,281 --> 00:42:00,648
Anything to tell? Like an update?

662
00:42:00,985 --> 00:42:02,475
<i>Something like that.</i>

663
00:42:04,288 --> 00:42:09,191
Things are going fine. Just fine.
maybe a little bit behind schedule.

664
00:42:11,795 --> 00:42:14,992
<i>Anything in particular</i>
<i>slowing things up?</i>

665
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:21,366
- Like?
<i>- Some guy locking himself in the vault.</i>

666
00:42:21,539 --> 00:42:24,497
<i>Who somehow has full knowledge</i>
<i>of our identities...</i>

667
00:42:24,508 --> 00:42:28,763
<i>our cell numbers, and has</i>
<i>the ability to dial 911.</i>

668
00:42:28,779 --> 00:42:31,270
<i>Handing you a first-class</i>
<i>pass to ass class...</i>

669
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:35,651
<i>in the federal penitentiary.</i>
<i>That sort of thing.</i>

670
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:39,013
Okay, we do have
one small dilemma.

671
00:42:40,157 --> 00:42:42,717
Quite similar to the one
you just described.

672
00:42:43,294 --> 00:42:45,956
<i>Is there anything else</i>
<i>you'd like to add?</i>

673
00:42:46,764 --> 00:42:48,129
Not really.

674
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:53,635
<i>Okay, is there anything else you not</i>
<i>like to add, then that I should know?</i>

675
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:58,640
Well, you know the guy you just,
you just described.

676
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:09,015
He's taken one of our people
hostage in the vault.

677
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:11,411
And uh... We're uh...

678
00:43:14,592 --> 00:43:18,221
We're locked out with no way in.

679
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,728
<i>Thank you.</i>
<i>I truly appreciate your candor.</i>

680
00:43:22,166 --> 00:43:26,068
<i>And a tactical analysis?</i>
<i>What would that currently be?</i>

681
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:30,472
- Fucked.
<i>- Great.</i>

682
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:33,928
<i>Okay, let me get back</i>
<i>to you with a backup plan...</i>

683
00:43:33,944 --> 00:43:36,708
<i>that should solve a few problems.</i>

684
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:39,647
Really? That'd be great.

685
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:50,416
Maybe not.

686
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:07,530
<i>- Hello.</i>
- I want to make a deal.

687
00:45:08,672 --> 00:45:10,003
<i>A deal.</i>

688
00:45:10,941 --> 00:45:12,272
<i>I do.</i>

689
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:17,403
<i>As I figure it, 50% of something is</i>
<i>a lot better than 100% of nothing.</i>

690
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,572
Yeah... and?

691
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:21,176
<i>And frankly, "nothing"</i>
<i>is all I've got right now.</i>

692
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:25,044
<i>So, what do you want?</i>
<i>What's it going to take?</i>

693
00:45:25,189 --> 00:45:28,124
You know what. Hold that thought.
I'll be right back.

694
00:45:29,426 --> 00:45:31,690
- Hello.
<i>- I want to make a deal.</i>

695
00:45:34,164 --> 00:45:35,085
Come again?

696
00:45:35,099 --> 00:45:37,966
<i>I think we may have gotten</i>
<i>off on the wrong foot.</i>

697
00:45:38,502 --> 00:45:41,960
<i>I'd like to start over</i>
<i>and introduce myself. I'm Nick.</i>

698
00:45:42,206 --> 00:45:45,266
<i>I'm calling to</i>
<i>cut you in on this thing.</i>

699
00:45:48,846 --> 00:45:50,598
So a deal, okay.

700
00:45:50,614 --> 00:45:55,779
So what's the deal with a deal, Nick?
It is "Nick," isn't it?

701
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:58,579
<i>I apologize for the pseudonym.</i>

702
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:03,782
<i>It's not that I don't trust you,</i>
<i>it's just sort of an occupational hazard.</i>

703
00:46:04,061 --> 00:46:07,394
Oh yeah, I...
I understand. I get it.

704
00:46:07,698 --> 00:46:10,030
It's not like my name's
really "Jinx" either.

705
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:11,761
<i>It isn't?</i>

706
00:46:12,836 --> 00:46:14,599
No. It is. It is my name.

707
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:17,206
<i>Hey that's okay.</i>
<i>Perfectly valid.</i>

708
00:46:17,541 --> 00:46:19,327
Anyway, what can I do for you, Nick?

709
00:46:19,343 --> 00:46:25,077
<i>Jinx, we have a bit</i>
<i>of a situation here.</i>

710
00:46:25,449 --> 00:46:28,475
<i>And I think it's down to you</i>
<i>and me to figure this thing out.</i>

711
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,653
You and me? Okay.

712
00:46:33,357 --> 00:46:35,086
<i>I'm going to put the cards</i>
<i>on the table.</i>

713
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:37,716
<i>You have something I need.</i>
<i>Information.</i>

714
00:46:37,728 --> 00:46:41,664
<i>Information my associates are</i>
<i>no longer in a position to offer.</i>

715
00:46:42,533 --> 00:46:46,219
<i>I propose we adapt, evolve,</i>
<i>grow some balls.</i>

716
00:46:46,236 --> 00:46:50,798
<i>Walk ourselves out of this quagmire.</i>
<i>I'll cut to the chase. What do you want?</i>

717
00:46:51,008 --> 00:46:52,532
My twenty bucks.

718
00:46:52,543 --> 00:46:56,070
<i>I'm sorry.</i>
<i>Did you say twenty bucks?</i>

719
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:00,374
<i>I don't want to be rude...</i>

720
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:03,382
<i>but I think you might want</i>
<i>to revise that number.</i>

721
00:47:03,687 --> 00:47:07,453
You think? Like what?

722
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:09,789
<i>Like look around you.</i>

723
00:47:10,194 --> 00:47:13,686
<i>I'd add a few zeroes to that</i>
<i>twenty-dollar figure of yours.</i>

724
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:17,165
And I just walk out with everything.

725
00:47:17,401 --> 00:47:19,585
You don't want any
piece of this money?

726
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:22,868
<i>All I need is for you to walk</i>
<i>over to the computer terminal...</i>

727
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:26,598
<i>and generate a PIN number</i>
<i>for me. Easy as pie.</i>

728
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:29,739
<i>Same arrangement</i>
<i>I had with them.</i>

729
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:32,371
<i>"If it ain't broke</i>
<i>don't fix it,"right?</i>

730
00:47:35,118 --> 00:47:36,779
"If it ain't broke..."

731
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:39,849
Right. Yeah.

732
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:43,191
So, I walk.

733
00:47:44,194 --> 00:47:47,925
And you have no problem selling
out Simon and Jessica.

734
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:52,160
And whoever else just
for a little info?

735
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:55,287
This must be a pretty
valuable PIN number.

736
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:57,967
<i>Things change.</i>
<i>We adapt, right?</i>

737
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:00,801
- Bullshit.
<i>- What?</i>

738
00:48:01,745 --> 00:48:04,009
I said bullshit.

739
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:08,247
You had no intention of letting these
guys out of here! Did you, Nick?

740
00:48:09,286 --> 00:48:10,776
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

741
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:13,472
"If it ain't broke, don't fix it."
Right?

742
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:16,175
In fact, that reminds me
of something a friend once said.

743
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:18,616
"Breaking" into a bank
is what screws you...

744
00:48:18,629 --> 00:48:22,531
<i>because "breaking in" takes time</i>
<i>and time is what gets you caught.</i>

745
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:26,063
So how do you rob a bank
without "breaking in?"

746
00:48:26,703 --> 00:48:29,058
<i>Unlock everything at once?</i>
<i>Fast and efficient?</i>

747
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:32,269
<i>Use this computer, a few codes,</i>
<i>then grab and go?</i>

748
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:35,200
I don't think so. If you knew
enough to get these codes...

749
00:48:35,212 --> 00:48:36,565
and what to do with...

750
00:48:36,580 --> 00:48:40,448
<i>then you knew this vault door would</i>
<i>seal up as soon as an alarm was tripped.</i>

751
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,446
<i>You're trapped.</i>

752
00:48:42,786 --> 00:48:47,416
So, while the codes seem like a good
idea, they're nothing more than bait...

753
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:50,319
just means to some other end for you.

754
00:48:50,494 --> 00:48:53,463
In other words,
the codes are bullshit.

755
00:48:54,164 --> 00:48:57,429
It's really about
that innocent little PIN...

756
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:01,128
<i>which I'm betting is worth</i>
<i>a lot more than anything else in here.</i>

757
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:04,574
But the only way to get
that PIN is in this vault.

758
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:08,036
I don't know, just a working theory.

759
00:49:08,178 --> 00:49:09,975
<i>All right there, Columbo...</i>

760
00:49:10,180 --> 00:49:14,480
<i>you seem to be answering a lot of unasked</i>
<i>questions for an "innocent"bystander.</i>

761
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:16,448
<i>What the hell are you getting at?</i>

762
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,281
Hey, it's not for nothing...

763
00:49:18,455 --> 00:49:22,721
but I didn't ask to be locked
in this frickin' vault!

764
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:27,654
All I ever wanted was
my twenty bucks but no!

765
00:49:28,031 --> 00:49:29,726
<i>Some greedy bastard</i>
<i>decided it was a great idea...</i>

766
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:31,758
<i>to increase his</i>
<i>bank's profit margin...</i>

767
00:49:31,768 --> 00:49:34,760
<i>fire tellers to</i>
<i>lower corporate costs...</i>

768
00:49:34,771 --> 00:49:37,433
<i>close branches, install</i>
<i>endless ATM machines...</i>

769
00:49:37,441 --> 00:49:39,591
<i>surcharging my ass</i>
<i>to kingdom-come...</i>

770
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:42,032
<i>until I can't afford</i>
<i>my own twenty bucks.</i>

771
00:49:42,045 --> 00:49:44,809
<i>What the hell does that have</i>
<i>to do with anything?</i>

772
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:45,902
<i>I'm glad you asked.</i>

773
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:47,872
<i>"Insufficient Funds"</i>
<i>means I had to walk...</i>

774
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:50,808
<i>my ass into the only Union Federal</i>
<i>I could find to withdraw my money...</i>

775
00:49:50,821 --> 00:49:54,712
<i>but it was already having a large</i>
<i>withdrawal made, i.e. being robbed...</i>

776
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:56,147
<i>which was perfectly fine by me...</i>

777
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,979
<i>until some jack-ass pointed</i>
<i>a gun at me.</i>

778
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:00,145
<i>This guy gets all jumpy,</i>
<i>tries to blow my head off...</i>

779
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:02,449
<i>his gun jams and I run</i>
<i>for cover in this vault...</i>

780
00:50:02,466 --> 00:50:05,424
<i>which proceeds to lock behind me</i>
<i>locking me in this vault...</i>

781
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:09,235
<i>where I literally run into some super</i>
<i>hot chick whom I'm trapped with...</i>

782
00:50:09,439 --> 00:50:11,395
<i>which sounds great except she</i>
<i>proceeded to punch me in the face...</i>

783
00:50:11,408 --> 00:50:13,535
<i>ruining my otherwise</i>
<i>wonderfully boring day...</i>

784
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:16,478
<i>and wasting my pedantically</i>
<i>precious time.</i>

785
00:50:17,247 --> 00:50:18,373
Bummer.

786
00:50:19,049 --> 00:50:22,985
So screw it, screw service
fees and screw you!

787
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:25,179
You and all the corporate
"convenience" criminals...

788
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,748
are equally fucked
in your high- tech heists.

789
00:50:27,758 --> 00:50:30,113
You can't keep screwing
guys like me...

790
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:32,288
and then add a surcharge for it.

791
00:50:32,562 --> 00:50:35,156
I'm taking charge of the surcharge.

792
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:39,126
In short, blow me. I want answers.

793
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:43,430
<i>You are having a bad day.</i>
<i>Please, go on.</i>

794
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:49,004
The real question is, how do you get in
this vault without getting trapped in it?

795
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:50,866
My guess is, you don't do it at all.

796
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:51,734
You don't care...

797
00:50:51,748 --> 00:50:54,000
if your anonymously
hired guns get trapped...

798
00:50:54,017 --> 00:50:55,336
as long as they are in the vault.

799
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:57,445
Because as long as
you had someone in the vault...

800
00:50:57,454 --> 00:50:59,888
you had what you wanted, almost.

801
00:51:00,190 --> 00:51:02,511
<i>- So, fuck you, I'm hanging up.</i>
- No. Fuck you!

802
00:51:02,526 --> 00:51:04,016
You're not hanging up.
You know why?

803
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:05,983
Because you don't have your
four precious little numbers.

804
00:51:05,996 --> 00:51:07,418
<i>- What the?</i>
- Jessica. Name's Jessica.

805
00:51:07,431 --> 00:51:10,093
I'm one of the ones you
set up to screw.

806
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:13,031
- Yeah. It almost hurts, doesn't it?
<i>- What?</i>

807
00:51:13,336 --> 00:51:16,328
I'm glad you asked,
it's called "Exploding Noema."

808
00:51:17,374 --> 00:51:18,591
It's a theory about the moment...

809
00:51:18,608 --> 00:51:19,996
you can't reconcile
the difference...

810
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:21,363
between your perception
of what should be...

811
00:51:21,378 --> 00:51:23,300
versus the reality of what is

812
00:51:23,313 --> 00:51:26,407
I find, completely screwing someone
with a classic double-cross...

813
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,304
only to find they're
now your only hope...

814
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:30,570
will pretty much
explode your noema.

815
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,407
But, I'm betting that
moment's past now and...

816
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:35,323
I'm betting you're more
in the dealing mood.

817
00:51:39,796 --> 00:51:42,856
You want your precious PIN?
There's gonna be a surcharge.

818
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:46,130
- So, what's it going to be Nick?
<i>- Okay.</i>

819
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:01,647
Jessica, are you okay?

820
00:52:02,853 --> 00:52:04,150
I'm fine.

821
00:52:04,888 --> 00:52:06,913
I think someone cut
the power in here.

822
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:08,250
You think?

823
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:15,025
Who cut the power then,
and why, what's going on...

824
00:52:15,132 --> 00:52:16,588
you know, that sort of thing?

825
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,864
I don't really know,
but it's not good.

826
00:52:23,106 --> 00:52:24,971
Nick, we're gonna have
to call you back.

827
00:52:27,511 --> 00:52:30,139
We have to fix this. I don't have
a handle on this whole thing...

828
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,103
but it's pretty apparent that
our fate and any possible fortune...

829
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:34,049
is in that computer.

830
00:52:34,751 --> 00:52:36,616
Nobody panic, okay?

831
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:39,981
Let me make a phone call.

832
00:52:44,194 --> 00:52:45,627
<i>- Oh, hey there.</i>
- Hello?

833
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:47,386
<i>Hey, what happened?</i>

834
00:52:48,098 --> 00:52:51,465
I don't know, I've been on hold
this whole time with you.

835
00:52:53,403 --> 00:52:55,257
Are you trying to keep me waiting?

836
00:52:55,272 --> 00:52:56,421
I have to admit...

837
00:52:56,439 --> 00:52:59,272
nice negotiation tactic...

838
00:52:59,910 --> 00:53:02,003
you had me going there for a while.

839
00:53:02,212 --> 00:53:04,510
<i>No. I just forgot about you.</i>

840
00:53:04,781 --> 00:53:07,045
How did you forget about me?

841
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:10,250
<i>I was... busy, that's all.</i>

842
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:12,981
Busy? You're locked in a vault.

843
00:53:13,123 --> 00:53:15,751
What the fuck could you be doing
to keep you busy?

844
00:53:17,194 --> 00:53:18,752
You worry me now, Jinx.

845
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:21,993
<i>Oh, I'm sorry</i>
<i>really. Please, don't worry.</i>

846
00:53:22,165 --> 00:53:24,656
<i>Officer DeGepse was just</i>
<i>talking me through this crisis.</i>

847
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:28,695
<i>It's been very stressful for me.</i>
<i>I didn't let him know anything really.</i>

848
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:32,130
<i>I figured you'd want me</i>
<i>to keep him waiting while you...</i>

849
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,599
<i>And I make some sort of a deal.</i>

850
00:53:34,611 --> 00:53:35,669
Okay. Okay.

851
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:40,443
Good thinking Jinxy.
That was good.

852
00:53:42,018 --> 00:53:47,479
All right, it's you and me.
About that deal...

853
00:53:47,891 --> 00:53:49,711
<i>Well, first, what happened?</i>

854
00:53:49,726 --> 00:53:52,354
<i>It's frickin' dark in here.</i>
<i>I think they cut the power.</i>

855
00:53:52,362 --> 00:53:55,422
Don't sweat it. They just do this
to be intimidating.

856
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:58,728
First order of business
is that we reach an agreement.

857
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,462
Then we'll negotiate with the cops...

858
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:04,640
free some hostages in exchange
for putting the power back on...

859
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,634
Hold on. Hold on.

860
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:10,873
Hold on I think my batt...
Fuck!

861
00:54:11,615 --> 00:54:13,412
Fuck! Fuck!

862
00:54:14,351 --> 00:54:17,047
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

863
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:19,750
Fuck! Fuck!

864
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:36,698
Think he's trying
to communicate with us?

865
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:48,415
<i>Hello?</i>

866
00:54:48,585 --> 00:54:51,452
Officer DeGepse here.
How are you two holding up?

867
00:54:51,588 --> 00:54:53,317
<i>Oh, hey there. Yeah, we're okay.</i>

868
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:56,081
Any change of status in there?

869
00:54:56,092 --> 00:54:57,878
<i>It's pretty dark in here.</i>

870
00:54:57,894 --> 00:55:00,226
<i>Eyes are just starting to adjust.</i>

871
00:55:01,498 --> 00:55:03,193
- Uh, not really.
<i>- Good. Good.</i>

872
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:05,732
<i>I need you to sit tight and...</i>

873
00:55:06,102 --> 00:55:09,799
We need him to turn
the power back on or we're screwed.

874
00:55:10,373 --> 00:55:12,159
Sorry, what was that?
I missed the last part.

875
00:55:12,175 --> 00:55:15,872
<i>I said, do you have any other</i>
<i>way of contacting Simon?</i>

876
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:18,842
He says he has no way
of contacting Simon?

877
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:22,642
- Why?
- Good question. Uh. Why?

878
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:27,587
<i>Because this Simon character has tossed</i>
<i>his phone for no apparent reason...</i>

879
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,915
<i>his actions are growing</i>
<i>increasingly irrational...</i>

880
00:55:30,927 --> 00:55:34,556
<i>and I would like to prevent any</i>
<i>regrettable incidents before they occur.</i>

881
00:55:34,564 --> 00:55:37,692
<i>Unfortunately, I now have no</i>
<i>way of contacting him.</i>

882
00:55:40,437 --> 00:55:42,496
All right, we'll see what we can do.

883
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:44,464
What do we do?

884
00:55:44,474 --> 00:55:46,499
We can't ask for Simon's
help because...

885
00:55:46,509 --> 00:55:47,931
we'd have to make him a deal.

886
00:55:47,944 --> 00:55:50,265
And making a deal with Simon
is pointless...

887
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,740
because like it or not,
at this point, he's shit out of luck.

888
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,885
We could... ask for Simon?

889
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:05,316
DeGepse here.

890
00:56:05,328 --> 00:56:08,456
<i>I got through to Simon.</i>
<i>He has a few demands.</i>

891
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:10,521
<i>He says he's finished</i>
<i>negotiating and...</i>

892
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:14,196
unless you give him something,
you know, as a show of good faith.

893
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:17,861
Go ahead, what are his demands?

894
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:21,833
<i>One. He wants a civilian chartered</i>
<i>helicopter on the roof within 15 minutes.</i>

895
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:25,466
<i>Two. He walks with half the money</i>
<i>and no one gets hurt.</i>

896
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:29,270
And three, he wants the power on so
he can get the show on the road.

897
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:32,379
Personally, I wouldn't give
that schizoid asshole anything...

898
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,243
unless it was something
totally useless, like...

899
00:56:34,257 --> 00:56:36,555
<i>I don't know, like turning</i>
<i>the power back on.</i>

900
00:56:37,293 --> 00:56:41,457
I'll try to convince him that turning
the power on is, just a start.

901
00:56:42,365 --> 00:56:47,029
May as well try, he sounds desperate
and willing to throw it all away.

902
00:56:47,404 --> 00:56:49,702
You say he sounds desperate?

903
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,706
You really think he's to
the point of throwing it all away?

904
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:54,764
I told you they were trying
to tell us something...

905
00:56:54,778 --> 00:56:57,303
with that whole "chucking-the-cell
phone-at-your-head" thing.

906
00:57:01,251 --> 00:57:04,186
Tell them the power will
be back on in a minute.

907
00:57:09,058 --> 00:57:12,960
*TIP 8
DON'T GET <i>GREEDY*</i>

908
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:20,802
That's a start. Get what's
his name back on the phone...

909
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:24,371
and I'll get this thing booted up
and ready for whatever.

910
00:57:28,745 --> 00:57:29,939
<i>Hello.</i>

911
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,409
So, listen up.

912
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:35,903
Believe me when I tell you
this whole thing is going south.

913
00:57:35,919 --> 00:57:37,637
So, whatever it is
you were planning to do...

914
00:57:37,654 --> 00:57:39,110
I'd suggest we do it...

915
00:57:39,122 --> 00:57:40,680
and whatever deal
we need to make...

916
00:57:40,690 --> 00:57:42,282
I suggest we make it...

917
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:45,284
or none of us are going
anywhere or getting anything...

918
00:57:46,362 --> 00:57:49,354
anytime soon, except maybe ten
to twenty in San Quentin.

919
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:50,658
So, what's it going to be?

920
00:57:50,667 --> 00:57:52,726
<i>Good to hear from you too.</i>

921
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:55,196
Dude. Shut it.

922
00:57:55,205 --> 00:57:58,891
The police cut the power.
No power, no computer...

923
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:00,899
no computer, no point.

924
00:58:01,344 --> 00:58:02,936
You count on that little hic-up?

925
00:58:02,946 --> 00:58:06,404
<i>God. Really?</i>
<i>No. I didn't.</i>

926
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:11,140
Well, you can thank me later.
It's back up for the moment.

927
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,873
Unless you tell me what our little
team here is about to do...

928
00:58:13,890 --> 00:58:16,245
this whole thing's going
to be over before it began.

929
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:18,591
<i>Is the computer on?</i>

930
00:58:19,028 --> 00:58:19,881
I believe we're good.

931
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:23,832
<i>Enter that number in the "Personal</i>
<i>Identification Number" sub-menu.</i>

932
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,534
<i>In that page, you'll see four digits</i>
<i>corresponding to an ATM card.</i>

933
00:58:28,872 --> 00:58:30,260
<i>Click that option...</i>

934
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:33,299
<i>and read me the four digits</i>
<i>that appear in the box.</i>

935
00:58:33,309 --> 00:58:34,970
<i>It is that easy.</i>

936
00:58:35,578 --> 00:58:38,240
- No. It's not.
<i>- I'm sorry?</i>

937
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:41,006
Last time I checked,
there's no "l" in "team"...

938
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:44,214
or "felony grand theft
of a federal reserve bank."

939
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:47,520
You get that number
and you're gone.

940
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:52,027
That PIN number belongs
to an ATM card I don't have...

941
00:58:52,195 --> 00:58:56,052
which belongs to an account I don't
have. So unless you can find...

942
00:58:56,065 --> 00:58:58,659
a way to share your little
high-tech heist you're stuck.

943
00:58:58,668 --> 00:59:01,956
I suggest you begin by telling
me what we're stealing.

944
00:59:01,971 --> 00:59:03,029
And the clock's ticking.

945
00:59:03,139 --> 00:59:04,868
<i>Okay. Fine.</i>

946
00:59:05,708 --> 00:59:08,609
<i>Nickels and dimes.</i>
<i>Lots of them.</i>

947
00:59:10,079 --> 00:59:12,240
What? Why?
Why are we stealing change?

948
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:14,216
<i>Why? Because I could.</i>

949
00:59:14,484 --> 00:59:18,318
<i>Getting greedy with what you want</i>
<i>to steal will only get you caught.</i>

950
00:59:18,721 --> 00:59:22,555
<i>You have to ask yourself "why"</i>
<i>you think you can get away with it.</i>

951
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:27,226
<i>Know "why"and the "what", "where"</i>
<i>and "how" will follow.</i>

952
00:59:27,797 --> 00:59:33,702
Okay, so how are we gonna rob a bank
and actually get away with it?

953
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:37,737
<i>Ever notice how everything has</i>
<i>some piddly-ass surcharge added?</i>

954
00:59:37,907 --> 00:59:39,534
Yeah. Now you're speaking
to the choir, my friend.

955
00:59:39,542 --> 00:59:42,773
<i>Now I need you to listen closely</i>
<i>and be really honest here.</i>

956
00:59:43,846 --> 00:59:44,631
Shoot.

957
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:46,911
<i>Do you always balance</i>
<i>your checkbook?</i>

958
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:50,644
- I've done it.
<i>- Yeah, right.</i>

959
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:56,110
<i>Even if you do, have you ever checked</i>
<i>to see if a bank didn't charge you...</i>

960
00:59:56,125 --> 00:59:59,014
<i>a surcharge for an ATM transaction?</i>

961
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:00,154
You had me at checkbook.

962
01:00:00,163 --> 01:00:03,462
<i>Which brings us back to "why."</i>
<i>It's simple.</i>

963
01:00:03,700 --> 01:00:06,692
<i>The world is too complicated</i>
<i>to keep track of.</i>

964
01:00:06,703 --> 01:00:09,490
<i>Life is made of a million moments,</i>
<i>trans actions...</i>

965
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:12,531
<i>passwords and pin-numbers</i>
<i>to memorize.</i>

966
01:00:12,675 --> 01:00:14,302
<i>It's not that we don't</i>
<i>want to keep track...</i>

967
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:18,440
<i>it's just that it's not worth</i>
<i>our time until you add it up.</i>

968
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:21,539
<i>How do we rob a bank and</i>
<i>why will we get away with it?</i>

969
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:24,987
<i>Add up the chump change.</i>
<i>We're stealing surcharges.</i>

970
01:00:25,388 --> 01:00:28,186
<i>And it's missing money</i>
<i>no one is missing.</i>

971
01:00:29,025 --> 01:00:31,050
What about the bank missing?

972
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:33,695
- We have a problem.
- Yeah, that's what I said.

973
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:36,355
No. It's another kind of problem.

974
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:41,826
I wasn't planning on
getting locked in here.

975
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:43,692
We've been in here for hours.
I couldn't hold it forever.

976
01:00:43,706 --> 01:00:45,765
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Okay. Of course.

977
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:49,033
Well.

978
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:51,478
I just won't look.

979
01:00:55,418 --> 01:00:56,476
All right...

980
01:00:57,854 --> 01:00:59,822
wait, I've got an idea!

981
01:01:00,590 --> 01:01:03,912
- Nick, hold on.
<i>- What's going on?</i>

982
01:01:03,926 --> 01:01:05,359
Don't ask.

983
01:01:08,297 --> 01:01:09,889
What are you doing?

984
01:01:23,780 --> 01:01:25,304
No way!

985
01:01:25,782 --> 01:01:27,682
Beggars can't be choosers, man.

986
01:01:29,786 --> 01:01:30,935
So, what about
the bank noticing?

987
01:01:30,953 --> 01:01:34,514
<i>Okay. Well, like I said,</i>
<i>you never rob the bank...</i>

988
01:01:34,524 --> 01:01:37,152
<i>at least not noticeably.</i>

989
01:01:37,160 --> 01:01:37,990
Stop it...

990
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:41,424
<i>So, what if, for every dozen</i>
<i>ATM transactions...</i>

991
01:01:41,431 --> 01:01:44,320
<i>you simply divert one surcharge</i>
<i>into an account already set-up...</i>

992
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:47,461
<i>within the bank.</i>
<i>Nothing more than missing nickels...</i>

993
01:01:47,470 --> 01:01:48,835
<i>and no way to track it.</i>

994
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:50,689
Yeah. I'm all for
the economics lesson...

995
01:01:50,707 --> 01:01:53,801
but what are we really
talking about here?

996
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:54,936
<i>Honestly?</i>

997
01:01:54,944 --> 01:01:57,606
This is the only choice you have if
you ever wanna see any of that money?

998
01:01:57,914 --> 01:02:02,044
<i>Okay. Eight million two hundred sixty</i>
<i>six thousand five hundred dollars.</i>

999
01:02:05,822 --> 01:02:07,551
<i>Can you hear me now?</i>

1000
01:02:09,592 --> 01:02:13,153
- That's a lot of transactions!
<i>- Those nickels and dimes add up.</i>

1001
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:16,956
And no one's on to you?

1002
01:02:16,966 --> 01:02:19,594
<i>Why? The stolen money never</i>
<i>left the bank.</i>

1003
01:02:19,602 --> 01:02:24,539
<i>The irony is, it is all just sitting</i>
<i>in legitimate Grant Liberty accounts.</i>

1004
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:27,676
- Waiting to be withdrawn.
<i>- That's right.</i>

1005
01:02:28,845 --> 01:02:30,528
As long as you have a valid
PIN number to those accounts...

1006
01:02:30,546 --> 01:02:32,605
you can just slowly withdraw it...

1007
01:02:32,615 --> 01:02:34,970
using nothing more than an ATM card.

1008
01:02:34,984 --> 01:02:38,078
- No one would ever notice!
- How to rob a bank.

1009
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,848
And actually get away with it.

1010
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:44,375
If I'm not mistaken,
we'd better work out a deal...

1011
01:02:44,393 --> 01:02:46,452
before there's nothing
worth working out.

1012
01:02:46,462 --> 01:02:47,713
So, you give us
your account numbers...

1013
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:49,686
and we'll assign the PIN
to a new ATM card.

1014
01:02:49,699 --> 01:02:52,088
<i>No deal.</i>
<i>If I just give you the accounts...</i>

1015
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:54,558
<i>Giving you the accounts</i>
<i>is like giving me the PIN.</i>

1016
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:57,971
<i>No guarantee the other</i>
<i>won't take off with it all.</i>

1017
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:07,172
Okay. What now?

1018
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,146
<i>Somebody just has</i>
<i>to trust somebody.</i>

1019
01:03:12,054 --> 01:03:15,387
I don't suppose my good
word would be sufficient?

1020
01:03:16,592 --> 01:03:18,617
Honor among thieves and all that?

1021
01:03:19,195 --> 01:03:20,423
Wait.

1022
01:03:20,997 --> 01:03:22,521
"Insufficient funds."

1023
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:25,558
That's what got my ass into
all this in the first place.

1024
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:30,132
- Yeah! Your twenty bucks, surcharges.
- No. My PIN.

1025
01:03:30,339 --> 01:03:33,706
We assign my PIN number
to "Nick's" accounts.

1026
01:03:33,843 --> 01:03:35,162
That way only I know my PIN...

1027
01:03:35,178 --> 01:03:37,373
and only "Nick" has the card
and the accounts.

1028
01:03:37,713 --> 01:03:38,737
<i>And?</i>

1029
01:03:40,249 --> 01:03:43,548
You see, you can't use the
ATM card without my PIN number...

1030
01:03:44,086 --> 01:03:46,850
and without the card and
the accounts, the PIN is useless.

1031
01:03:47,089 --> 01:03:48,511
We don't have to trust each other.

1032
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:50,116
We can meet and use
the two together...

1033
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:52,117
and go our separate ways.

1034
01:03:52,361 --> 01:03:53,988
<i>Works for me.</i>

1035
01:03:58,968 --> 01:04:02,597
Just hold on to that idea.
I'd better get this.

1036
01:04:06,776 --> 01:04:07,936
Hello?

1037
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,065
All right the power has been up
for over ten minutes now...

1038
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:12,502
and still no word
from anybody in there.

1039
01:04:12,515 --> 01:04:16,451
- Have you heard anything?
<i>- Uh, not really, well, you see...</i>

1040
01:04:20,389 --> 01:04:22,414
What? I didn't know what else to do.

1041
01:04:23,426 --> 01:04:25,087
I think we're out of time.

1042
01:04:25,494 --> 01:04:27,621
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

1043
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:30,982
This is it. It's now or never.
Either we go with Jinx's plan...

1044
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,286
or that money just sits
in the bank forever.

1045
01:04:33,302 --> 01:04:36,794
<i>Okay, you're right. A couple a million</i>
<i>bucks is better than none, right?</i>

1046
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:38,224
<i>Just go to the computer...</i>

1047
01:04:38,241 --> 01:04:41,165
<i>do what I told you before</i>
<i>you have Jinx enter his PIN.</i>

1048
01:04:41,177 --> 01:04:42,337
All right.

1049
01:04:56,592 --> 01:04:59,356
Jinx. What is it?

1050
01:05:00,997 --> 01:05:05,696
I don't know. What if we get caught?
What if we end up serving life?

1051
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:07,600
Life?

1052
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:09,765
Right.

1053
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:12,230
See, I don't know about you, Jinx...

1054
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:14,903
but this hasn't felt like
much of a life to me.

1055
01:05:17,480 --> 01:05:19,641
Just some anonymous hired hand.

1056
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:25,077
Is this my life?
This for the rest of my life?

1057
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:28,374
Is your life about
$1.50 surcharges...

1058
01:05:28,391 --> 01:05:31,417
playing bitch-boy to every Simon
and Grant Liberty?

1059
01:05:32,895 --> 01:05:35,295
When are we going to make
some choices of our own?

1060
01:05:40,870 --> 01:05:42,167
Today has been...

1061
01:05:44,674 --> 01:05:45,834
different.

1062
01:05:47,576 --> 01:05:49,237
I think this is it.

1063
01:05:51,013 --> 01:05:56,383
You know, I think this is life.
Choices like this.

1064
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:04,122
You know, our lives aren't some
big monumental moment.

1065
01:06:06,062 --> 01:06:08,189
It's a choice here,
and a choice there.

1066
01:06:09,632 --> 01:06:12,430
Life is made up like that,
of these tiny moments.

1067
01:06:15,671 --> 01:06:18,435
I think I'm sick of this life.

1068
01:06:21,077 --> 01:06:22,339
So...

1069
01:06:23,346 --> 01:06:26,315
How big can we make
this moment Jinx?

1070
01:06:28,584 --> 01:06:30,415
And get a life.

1071
01:06:32,955 --> 01:06:36,823
Are you insane?
This is a tiny moment to you?

1072
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:41,323
Yeah. Okay. Yeah.

1073
01:06:41,564 --> 01:06:44,192
It's a big moment.

1074
01:06:44,600 --> 01:06:47,000
It's a... yeah.

1075
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:51,537
But the principle's the same.
Make a choice. What are we gonna do?

1076
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:53,965
What are you going to do?

1077
01:06:55,077 --> 01:06:59,275
I'm going to get my twenty bucks...
and then some.

1078
01:07:00,549 --> 01:07:03,143
Right. Yeah.
Let's do this.

1079
01:07:04,820 --> 01:07:06,378
Enter your PIN.

1080
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:10,155
So, this little box is the key
to our fortune, huh?

1081
01:07:13,562 --> 01:07:17,293
There. That's it.
We're done. Now what?

1082
01:07:21,170 --> 01:07:24,037
Now, we go.

1083
01:07:26,942 --> 01:07:30,969
<i>Excuse me... guys? It just occurred</i>
<i>to me. We have a problem.</i>

1084
01:07:31,213 --> 01:07:34,512
- What's up?
<i>- Well, you have no way out.</i>

1085
01:07:35,684 --> 01:07:40,519
- What?
<i>- Well, she doesn't have a way out.</i>

1086
01:07:43,159 --> 01:07:45,445
What do you mean? She's got
the scam with the cops.

1087
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:47,315
They think she's one of the hostages.

1088
01:07:47,329 --> 01:07:50,924
<i>Okay, well, that doesn't solve</i>
<i>the "Simon problem."</i>

1089
01:07:51,667 --> 01:07:54,192
<i>Even if you wait until</i>
<i>the cops storm the place...</i>

1090
01:07:54,203 --> 01:07:55,795
<i>he's not going quietly.</i>

1091
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:59,673
<i>He can easily turn her in when he</i>
<i>finds out she's not busted with him.</i>

1092
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:03,808
No, no. Not after all this.

1093
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:11,845
Hold on.

1094
01:08:17,026 --> 01:08:18,584
Officer DeGepse here.

1095
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:21,279
<i>I'm sorry my signal died,</i>
<i>but I'm back in a good zone.</i>

1096
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:23,265
Great, any news?

1097
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:26,050
<i>Simon says he appreciates</i>
<i>your show of good faith...</i>

1098
01:08:26,068 --> 01:08:28,764
<i>and in return, he's willing</i>
<i>to release two hostages.</i>

1099
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:34,867
- Me and Jessica.
<i>- No shit? Really?</i>

1100
01:08:35,377 --> 01:08:37,641
<i>Okay, okay, we got you covered.</i>

1101
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:43,108
We got you covered. Look.
Okay, look. Listen...

1102
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:46,520
make your way out slowly
and we'll take care of the rest.

1103
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:49,291
This will all be over soon.

1104
01:08:49,425 --> 01:08:52,121
So, I'll tell Simon you're ready
for the release.

1105
01:08:54,396 --> 01:08:56,421
Now, we're cooking with gasoline.

1106
01:08:57,633 --> 01:09:01,125
- Do you have any way of reaching Simon?
- Yeah, I can call Roger.

1107
01:09:01,504 --> 01:09:04,473
- Who?
- His muscle.

1108
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:05,831
The other guy on the team.

1109
01:09:05,841 --> 01:09:07,968
He gave me his number in case
there were complications.

1110
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:10,078
I think this qualifies
as a complication.

1111
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:11,873
Nick, we're gonna call you back.

1112
01:09:15,818 --> 01:09:17,445
<i>- Hello?</i>
- I gotta talk to Simon.

1113
01:09:17,453 --> 01:09:19,444
<i>He's kinda busy at the moment.</i>
<i>Who is this?</i>

1114
01:09:19,455 --> 01:09:21,423
Roger, put him on the phone.

1115
01:09:31,967 --> 01:09:33,992
- Hello?
<i>- Hey, it's me, Jinx.</i>

1116
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:36,528
Hey Jinx, what's up?

1117
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:41,201
I have to admit
you've really got me worried now.

1118
01:09:42,711 --> 01:09:44,872
<i>Sorry for the wait,</i>
<i>but we better make a deal fast.</i>

1119
01:09:44,880 --> 01:09:47,269
<i>- I got off the phone with DeGepse.</i>
- What did he say?

1120
01:09:47,283 --> 01:09:50,002
<i>He says that if they don't see</i>
<i>cooperation from you within 5 minutes...</i>

1121
01:09:50,019 --> 01:09:51,805
<i>they are storming</i>
<i>the place with SWAT.</i>

1122
01:09:51,820 --> 01:09:53,185
Shit! Shit...

1123
01:09:53,622 --> 01:09:54,611
Shit! Shit...

1124
01:09:54,757 --> 01:09:55,781
Shit! Shit...

1125
01:09:55,958 --> 01:09:57,118
Shit!

1126
01:09:57,793 --> 01:09:58,782
Shit!

1127
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:05,994
Okay.

1128
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:10,171
- What do they want?
<i>- You're not going to like it.</i>

1129
01:10:10,306 --> 01:10:11,967
What?! What is it?

1130
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:15,237
<i>They want at least one</i>
<i>hostage released and...</i>

1131
01:10:15,611 --> 01:10:17,340
And what?

1132
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:21,374
<i>One of you has to turn yourself in.</i>

1133
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:32,753
Fine. They can have Jessica.

1134
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:36,229
Really?
You'd turn her in? Just like that?

1135
01:10:36,398 --> 01:10:39,185
<i>What do I care? You want out</i>
<i>and I want in.</i>

1136
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:40,919
<i>Take Jessica as your insurance...</i>

1137
01:10:40,936 --> 01:10:43,632
<i>and the cops get their</i>
<i>precious negotiation pawn.</i>

1138
01:10:47,142 --> 01:10:48,837
Sounds like a plan.

1139
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:58,676
What's wrong?
This is our way out.

1140
01:11:11,700 --> 01:11:15,966
That might be the sweetest thing
anyone has ever done for me.

1141
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,632
Really?

1142
01:11:36,825 --> 01:11:38,793
Right. Let's get
the hell out of here.

1143
01:11:52,474 --> 01:11:53,429
What are you doing?

1144
01:11:53,442 --> 01:11:56,161
I'm setting up our next rendezvous
outside this vault.

1145
01:11:56,178 --> 01:11:58,669
Really? Is that a second date?

1146
01:12:01,216 --> 01:12:02,774
You'd better tie me up.

1147
01:12:05,187 --> 01:12:08,213
So Simon still thinks
I'm still your hostage.

1148
01:12:08,957 --> 01:12:10,754
You wish.

1149
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:13,723
You want to help me with this?

1150
01:12:18,033 --> 01:12:19,523
Is this good?

1151
01:12:19,935 --> 01:12:21,163
That's good.

1152
01:12:59,808 --> 01:13:01,708
<i>All right, I'm coming out.</i>

1153
01:13:03,846 --> 01:13:05,677
I don't want any trouble!

1154
01:13:24,066 --> 01:13:25,818
I imagined you taller.

1155
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:30,669
Fuck me, Jinx. Nice Attitude!
You've come a long way today.

1156
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:51,087
I can't go out there like this.

1157
01:13:51,293 --> 01:13:53,761
I'm supposed to be a hostage
like you, not your hostage.

1158
01:13:56,265 --> 01:13:58,062
They're gonna know something is up.

1159
01:14:03,539 --> 01:14:05,564
You're supposed to be my hostage
for Simon's sake...

1160
01:14:05,574 --> 01:14:07,405
if we want to get away with this.

1161
01:14:10,145 --> 01:14:12,045
What do you suggest we do?

1162
01:14:18,153 --> 01:14:20,348
Be careful that thing's loaded.

1163
01:14:20,589 --> 01:14:21,510
Shit.

1164
01:14:21,523 --> 01:14:23,491
Wait one fucking minute you two!

1165
01:14:50,819 --> 01:14:52,844
Go, come on.

1166
01:14:59,127 --> 01:15:00,651
Put your gun down!

1167
01:15:00,796 --> 01:15:03,629
Put that gun down, motherfucker!

1168
01:15:05,033 --> 01:15:06,660
Move.

1169
01:15:14,276 --> 01:15:15,766
Move, motherfucker!

1170
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,112
Do you understand me?

1171
01:15:23,252 --> 01:15:25,277
You have the right to remain silent.

1172
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:27,938
If you cannot afford an attorney,
one will be appointed for you.

1173
01:15:27,956 --> 01:15:33,053
Do you understand the rights
I have just stated.

1174
01:15:33,161 --> 01:15:35,959
Out of the way, come on.

1175
01:15:36,298 --> 01:15:38,232
Got it.

1176
01:15:40,969 --> 01:15:42,197
<i>Oh can you hear me?</i>

1177
01:15:42,471 --> 01:15:43,392
<i>Damn. How about now?</i>

1178
01:15:44,773 --> 01:15:46,707
<i>Yes, loud and clear.</i>

1179
01:15:47,342 --> 01:15:50,140
<i>Good, okay, where were we?</i>
<i>Chump change.</i>

1180
01:15:50,812 --> 01:15:53,372
<i>The dime you don't even</i>
<i>bother picking up is...</i>

1181
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:56,169
<i>the same dime we</i>
<i>all get bent- over for.</i>

1182
01:15:56,184 --> 01:15:59,950
<i>So, surcharge the surchargers!</i>
<i>I agree.</i>

1183
01:16:00,656 --> 01:16:02,954
<i>But there is one flaw</i>
<i>in your plan.</i>

1184
01:16:03,125 --> 01:16:05,525
Oh, a flaw in my plan?

1185
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:09,017
<i>If we've got the PIN</i>
<i>and you've got the accounts...</i>

1186
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:12,125
<i>what happens next?</i>
<i>What happens when we meet?</i>

1187
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:14,102
<i>Trust the fatal flaw.</i>

1188
01:16:15,804 --> 01:16:17,431
<i>Well, there's only one answer.</i>

1189
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:23,638
<i>Did you know that statistics say</i>
<i>that 98% of all convicted criminals...</i>

1190
01:16:23,645 --> 01:16:26,136
<i>have successfully committed</i>
<i>at least one previous crime...</i>

1191
01:16:26,148 --> 01:16:28,241
<i>before they were caught?</i>

1192
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:32,980
<i>That means almost everyone gets</i>
<i>away with it at least once!</i>

1193
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:37,248
<i>They had a good thing. But no,</i>
<i>they had to go try their luck again.</i>

1194
01:16:38,694 --> 01:16:41,151
<i>Oh. By the way, tip 10...</i>

1195
01:16:43,231 --> 01:16:45,324
<i>Know when to walk away.</i>

1196
01:16:46,305 --> 01:16:52,231
