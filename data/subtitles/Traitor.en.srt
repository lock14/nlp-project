1
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,840
We go now. Where your friend?

2
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,280
He's outside taking a piss.

3
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,880
He'll be right back.

4
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:59,480
Gun no good. You give me.

5
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,640
No. It's a very good gun.

6
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,640
Give me your gun. You understand?

7
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,720
I understand. I'm just
not giving you my gun.

8
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,160
Give him the gun, Archer.

9
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,080
You're kidding, right?

10
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,320
Every 12-year-old in this
country is carrying a Kalashnikov.

11
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,320
Exactly why your pea
shooter ain't worth shit.

12
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,480
Give it to him.

13
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,160
Where are you from?

14
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,360
All over.

15
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,040
But I was born in Sudan.

16
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:12,200
Your English is very good.

17
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,920
So is yours.

18
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,040
What is your business here?

19
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,200
Ahmed asked me to come.

20
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,280
He didn't tell me.

21
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,480
I can't negotiate like this.

22
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,120
Negotiate what?

23
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,360
I have six crates of Semtex,

24
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,280
custom-built
detonators, in my truck.

25
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,320
Are you interested?

26
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,040
Please...

27
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:56,520
sit down.

28
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,480
I can also show you how to use
them without blowing yourself up.

29
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,040
Unintentionally, that is.

30
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,280
Unintentionally.

31
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,360
That's funny.

32
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,880
Samir. Ahmed.

33
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,760
He was just about to.

34
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,640
What was that all about?

35
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,880
The captain was impressed with the
SIG. I told him he could keep it.

36
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,240
My gun?

37
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,840
You gave him my gun?

38
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:44,440
A small gesture of good will goes a
long way in this part of the world.

39
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,680
<i>Shukran. Let's go.</i>

40
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,480
Come on! Come on!

41
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,240
Hello, Mr. Horn, I'm
Special Agent Clayton, FBl.

42
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,240
This is Agent Archer.

43
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,560
FBl?

44
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:40,080
Since when does the
FBl operate in Yemen?

45
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,800
We don't. We have no authority here.

46
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,560
You're under Yemeni custody.

47
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,920
Bad fucking news for you.

48
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,240
If you're willing to help us,
we may be able to help you.

49
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,880
You're gonna help
me with no authority?

50
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,160
They listen to us a touch closer
when it comes to terrorism.

51
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,200
Oh, I'm a terrorist?

52
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,320
I don't know. You tell me. You
been selling them explosives?

53
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:58,280
Oh, I sell to whoever
can afford to buy.

54
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,800
Like the United States government.

55
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,560
Only ours don't
kill innocent people.

56
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,000
Oh, yeah, they do, genius.

57
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,400
People just usually
have darker skin.

58
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,800
Let's skip the political debate.

59
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:10,040
We just want to know where
the Semtex was headed.

60
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:12,480
I don't know. I didn't ask.

61
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,880
But you knew where it came from.

62
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,480
Yeah. It fell off
the back of a truck.

63
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,520
Answer the question.

64
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,320
You need to take some
lessons from the locals.

65
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,400
Ohh!

66
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,360
Let me talk to him.

67
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,800
Sorry. Must have forgotten
my Bill of Rights at home.

68
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:36,920
It's clear to me that
you're not a fanatic, Samir.

69
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,720
An opportunist perhaps,
but not a fanatic.

70
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,760
So consider this opportunity.

71
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,880
You have an American passport, which
means I can get you out of here.

72
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,800
But I do need an answer.

73
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,080
You want to spend the rest
of your life here, in Yemen?

74
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,160
You go right ahead.

75
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,880
But you and I both know
that I'm likely to be

76
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:59,640
the last friendly face you're
gonna see for a very long time.

77
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:05,400
I don't have anything to say to you.

78
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,800
The only difference
between you and him

79
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,480
is he knows he's an asshole.

80
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,240
Why don't you just go
home, Agent Clayton.

81
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,680
- Nice guy.
- You shouldn't have hit him.

82
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,960
- He deserved it.
- That's not the point.

83
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,160
You get a suspect to talk
by pushing his buttons,

84
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,280
not by letting him push yours.

85
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,240
Nobody ever teach you that?

86
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,320
You are a traitor. You sold us out.

87
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,080
Then why am I in here with you?

88
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,160
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

89
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,160
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

90
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,360
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

91
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,400
Eh, eh, eh.

92
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,920
You understand me?

93
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,800
Do you understand me?

94
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,720
Mmm.

95
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,000
Ah, forget Allah.

96
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,440
They cracked the encryption

97
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:40,440
on that satphone you
guys found in Yemen.

98
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,200
Check out the call log.

99
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,520
14 calls to Rome in early January,

100
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:46,360
17 calls to Berlin in March,

101
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,400
11 to Amsterdam in early May.

102
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:51,160
It correlates exactly with
the Al-Nathir bombings.

103
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:55,160
Rome, Berlin, Amsterdam.

104
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,400
Where did the calls go?

105
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,480
Payphones located in largely
immigrant, Muslim neighborhoods.

106
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,800
What have you found on Samir Horn?

107
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,960
No criminal record.

108
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,600
I searched NCIC, state
and local databases.

109
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:09,040
Nothing so far.

110
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,040
Well, check with the
military liaison, too.

111
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,440
He sure as shit didn't learn to put
detonators together in high school.

112
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,520
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

113
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,240
It's time to finish what we started.

114
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,640
It's already finished.

115
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,120
Lay your hand on any of my brothers,

116
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,520
and it will mean your life.

117
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:26,880
<i>Shukran.</i>

118
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,160
Where did you learn to play?

119
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:51,000
My father.

120
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,680
How about you?

121
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:54,320
Boarding school in Switzerland.

122
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,800
- You win.
- You want to play again?

123
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,400
I haven't had anybody
to play with for ages.

124
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,480
Why don't you play with one of them?

125
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:14,640
They're soldiers, not thinkers.

126
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:20,520
Soldiers or martyrs?

127
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:31,120
You know, I've been
in a lot of battles.

128
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:34,480
And they may have felt like
a suicide mission at the time,

129
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,800
but we always had
a plan to come home.

130
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:40,480
You must be willing to
sacrifice some of your pawns

131
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:42,840
if you want to win the game.

132
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,600
- I don't know.
- I think you do.

133
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,040
You risked your life to share
your food with a stranger.

134
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,680
That's not the same thing.
I was just doing my duty.

135
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:57,720
<i>- If I'd known there was-
- Jihad is also your duty.</i>

136
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,600
Ahmed told me what you
have done in Afghanistan.

137
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,480
Tactics have changed, my friend.

138
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:08,920
Tactics always change.

139
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,760
You don't defeat an empire
fighting by their rules.

140
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:14,320
Once upon a time,

141
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:19,040
it was the Americans who were
terrorists to the British.

142
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:22,080
They've forgotten
the history already.

143
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,880
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

144
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:07,680
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

145
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:19,960
Piece of sh-

146
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,280
<i>Senor?</i>

147
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,800
All right, don't tell anyone
I said this, but you're right.

148
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:49,880
- The military had a file on him.
- Hmm.

149
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:52,760
Staff Sergeant Samir Horn.
U.S. Army Special Forces.

150
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,720
Trained at Fort Bragg.

151
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,720
- Engineering and Explosives.
- All right, skip to the next page.

152
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,920
Horn was his mother's
name. She's from Chicago.

153
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,280
His father was Sudanese.

154
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,920
Moved all over the Middle East. Had
ties with the Muslim Brotherhood.

155
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,880
Was killed in a car bombing in '78.

156
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,320
Not sure which side was behind it.

157
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,240
- Is that so?
- Oh, and it gets better.

158
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,720
The Army sent Horn to Pakistan in
'86 to train in the Afghan rebels.

159
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:14,680
It's where he got in touch
with his Muslim roots.

160
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,520
Decided he wanted in on the action.

161
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,080
When his tour was
over, he stayed behind,

162
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,440
<i>and joined the Mujahideen.</i>

163
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,720
There's been a bombing in Spain.

164
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,240
Eleven Americans dead.
They've got the bomber.

165
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,000
<i>...an American tour group</i>

166
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,560
<i>was the target of the
attack, apparently.</i>

167
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,040
<i>The latest carried out by
Nathir, the Islamic terrorist</i>

168
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:34,000
<i>whose identity and whereabouts
remain a mystery to authorities.</i>

169
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,880
Do you have a woman? A family?

170
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:53,120
No.

171
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,120
You don't want no kids?

172
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,800
I don't have a woman.

173
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:13,040
What language do you dream in?

174
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:14,880
English.

175
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,360
Me, too.

176
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,600
Really?

177
00:22:18,680 --> 00:22:21,000
You know, it's funny-

178
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:25,160
I don't even feel at home
speaking my own language sometimes.

179
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,600
I don't feel at home anywhere.

180
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,520
Samir. Samir?

181
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:37,080
There is somebody that I want you
to meet when we get out of here.

182
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:41,800
We're in prison in
Yemen for terrorism.

183
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,920
I wouldn't make any plans, man.

184
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,000
This guy's got to be
in a state of shock.

185
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:00,080
He planned on waking up in
Paradise with 72 virgins.

186
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:02,880
Blow yourself up to get laid.
This has got to be some crazy shit.

187
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:05,560
Where I grew up, the Klan burned
crosses in front of people's houses

188
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,720
and called it "Christianity. "

189
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:08,440
And then my daddy and
the folks from the church

190
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,600
would drive over and put 'em out.

191
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,720
Seems every religion
has more than one face.

192
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:21,360
How you doin'?

193
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,520
Okay, I think I know.

194
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:29,480
You wish you were dead, don't ya?

195
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:30,880
You wish you'd been successful?

196
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,760
I've killed dozens of infidels.

197
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,760
But you're still alive.

198
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,080
And you don't strike me as a coward.

199
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,560
Of course I'm not a coward.

200
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,280
Well, some people are going
to think you lost your nerve.

201
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:41,480
I didn't.

202
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:45,080
You know, tomorrow's newspaper is going
to have your face on the front page

203
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,280
with a story about you being
captured and helping the police.

204
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,200
- That's a lie.
- You survived the blast.

205
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:52,920
You fell into enemy hands.
I don't think it is a lie.

206
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,200
Who do you think's gonna
have to pay for your failure?

207
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:03,960
So I'm guessing it'll
be your cousin, Hussein.

208
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,360
He's the one that got
you into all this, right?

209
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,640
Don't be surprised, Ziyad.

210
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:10,720
We know everything about you-

211
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,840
family, friends...
work, phone records.

212
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,600
We even know what you
listen to on your iPod.

213
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,840
Leave me alone.

214
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:25,000
<i>There is a way out.</i>

215
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,440
<i>But you're gonna have to
give us some information.</i>

216
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:29,240
<i>Nobody knows you're alive.</i>

217
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,480
If you answer my questions,

218
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,160
tomorrow's headline could tell
the world that you're dead.

219
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:42,160
Why should Hussein suffer for this?

220
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:44,120
Why should everyone
think you're a coward?

221
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:49,240
Come on, Ziyad.

222
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:51,800
You talk now or talk later.

223
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,800
The only difference is the story
that everybody's gonna hear about you.

224
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,000
Everything all right, brother?

225
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,280
Have faith.

226
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,840
And stay close.

227
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,880
No, no, no! No, no, no.

228
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:26,240
Stay down. Wait, wait, wait.

229
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,760
Now! Go, go!

230
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,840
- Sh- - No, no,
no, no. Wait, wait.

231
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,840
Come on! Come on!

232
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:13,680
<i>All I know is I was supposed
to go to America, not Spain.</i>

233
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:16,000
<i>Nathir was sending
a whole bunch of us.</i>

234
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,640
<i>And how many made it in the U.S.?</i>

235
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:20,120
<i>I don't know
- 30, 40. Maybe more.</i>

236
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,960
<i>They were handing out student visas.</i>

237
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,920
<i>And that's all I-</i>

238
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:26,280
Nice work.

239
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,440
The confession we got
in Spain was clear.

240
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:34,200
Now, the only reason Ziyad Hamzi
didn't make it into the United States

241
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,880
is because his student
visa was rejected.

242
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:38,520
But Nathir has sent
others and they are here.

243
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,840
Anybody else have
anything on Nathir?

244
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:46,840
About six months ago we
picked up an intercept.

245
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:51,280
Nothing solid but they did
talk about a Al-Nathir operation

246
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:52,480
<i>code named "Risala"-</i>

247
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:55,760
an attack with multiple
suicide bombers here in the U.S.

248
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:56,680
Hold on a sec.

249
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:59,080
You had intel on a domestic
attack and you didn't pass it on?

250
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:00,640
It was unsubstantiated.

251
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,280
Well how could it be
if you didn't share it?

252
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,640
Enough. I don't want to hear
anymore about people hoarding intel.

253
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,040
We're taking this threat seriously.

254
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:07,720
The White House is
gonna want action.

255
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:10,640
I'm talking about a major roundup
of guys who fit this profile.

256
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,720
And everyone works together on this.

257
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,400
- Kelly was pretty worked up.
- So?

258
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:18,040
So a couple months back he
told me that you were working

259
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,640
an asset inside on Nathir.

260
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,040
That was off the record.

261
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:23,560
Yeah. I'm just saying maybe, uh...

262
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,240
maybe that guy knows something.

263
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,320
He's gone silent.

264
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,600
For all I know, he's gone
over to the other side.

265
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,960
When the ship docks,
you have a choice.

266
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,800
You can get off and
walk away as a free man.

267
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,720
Our people can get you past customs.

268
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,640
Then you're on your own.

269
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,000
What if I stay?

270
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:58,720
Our path is not for everyone.

271
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,720
I understand.

272
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,920
I think of you as a friend, Samir.

273
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,360
So I will tell you this.

274
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,800
Do not decide lightly.

275
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,400
<i>- Bonsoir.
- Bonsoir.</i>

276
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,280
<i>Merci beaucoup, ma cherie.</i>

277
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,560
What's the matter?

278
00:29:41,640 --> 00:29:44,920
<i>- It's halal.
- It's a Krug '95, actually.</i>

279
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,200
Don't look so disturbed, Samir.

280
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:50,880
We shave, we drink alcohol,

281
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:52,640
and sometimes we even eat pork.

282
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,240
Hmm?

283
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,520
<i>In the Qur'an, it's called Taqiyya.</i>

284
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,680
"Become like your enemy
to deceive your enemy. "

285
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,040
<i>That's not Taqiyya.</i>

286
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,200
Excuse me?

287
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:04,200
With all due respect,
Brother Fareed,

288
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:07,600
<i>the Hadith says that the prophet
Muhammad Sall-Allahu Alayhi Wa Sallam</i>

289
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,920
told his followers that they
could lie about being Muslims

290
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,840
to save their lives
if death was imminent.

291
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:18,920
- It didn't mention- -
Is death not imminent now?

292
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,320
We're at war today.

293
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:23,080
And to be effective,
you need to blend in.

294
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,680
No one's even looking at us.

295
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,560
I told you, he's not
some foot soldier.

296
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,240
Samir is a man of faith.

297
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:35,920
Faith is good.

298
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:40,600
But you have to know how
to follow orders, too.

299
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,480
<i>In one of the largest Homeland
Security operations to date,</i>

300
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,920
<i>ICS and FBl agents are
questioning foreign students</i>

301
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,880
<i>who were issued visas in
Middle Eastern countries</i>

302
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,480
<i>over the past two years.</i>

303
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,280
<i>In some major cities, where
there are large numbers-</i>

304
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,720
<i>A number of American groups
have protested the operation,</i>

305
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,320
<i>claiming that it unfairly
targets innocent civilians</i>

306
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,400
<i>and amounts to racial profiling.</i>

307
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,960
<i>The American Civil
Liberty's Union has filed...</i>

308
00:31:19,080 --> 00:31:21,560
<i>...has found that the American
invasion and occupation of Iraq</i>

309
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:25,520
<i>has helped spawn a new
generation of Islamic radicalism.</i>

310
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,000
Homeland Security
- a waste of time and resources.

311
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:33,480
We'll never find them this way.

312
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,720
There are 1.2 billion
Muslims in this world.

313
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,040
Only 20% of them are Arab.

314
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:39,160
These people could look like
anybody, except maybe you.

315
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,360
What, so you don't think we
should be profiling these guys?

316
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:43,920
I just think we should be
concentrating on the one suspect

317
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,360
that we do have.

318
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,520
We train to kill, but it doesn't
mean that we love violence.

319
00:31:57,560 --> 00:32:01,960
We use violence only because
it has been used against us.

320
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:04,600
The crusaders have invade our land,

321
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,840
drop bombs on our people,

322
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,680
stole our natural resources.

323
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,000
We are fighting to
end the suffering.

324
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:13,880
We are fighting to end the
humiliation and murder of-

325
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,280
The Americans accuse us of
killing innocent civilians.

326
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,880
Yet they have been spilling the
blood of innocent Muslims for decades.

327
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,520
Does our blood not count?

328
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:24,400
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

329
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,440
History has shown us
that time and time again

330
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:30,280
no matter how great the empire,
no matter how difficult the odds,

331
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:35,040
a man who is not afraid to
die can never be defeated.

332
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,720
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

333
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,440
Thank you.

334
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:54,560
Your son is in a lot of trouble.

335
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,640
What sort of trouble?

336
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,880
He's involved with a
terrorist organization.

337
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,120
Do you believe in
God, Detective Clayton?

338
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:08,400
Uh, we don't use the
term "Detective," ma'am.

339
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,320
You didn't answer my question.

340
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:15,560
Yes, I do believe in
God. Why do you ask?

341
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:20,400
Because you will never understand
a man like Samir if you don't.

342
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,480
Would you describe
him as a devout Muslim?

343
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,640
He's Muslim.

344
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,680
I don't believe there
is a sliding scale.

345
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:30,760
Do you know what the
word "Islam" means?

346
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:31,840
"Submission. "

347
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,440
Yes. "Submission. "

348
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:37,120
Submission to God's
will is absolute.

349
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:41,120
Do you think Samir believes it's
God's will for him to kill others?

350
00:33:43,560 --> 00:33:45,400
You carry a gun yourself.

351
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:48,120
Now, you didn't answer my question.

352
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:54,320
My son has seen enough death
to understand the value of life.

353
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,760
<i>Who is it?</i>

354
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:06,400
FBl, ma'am. It's about Samir Horn.

355
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:11,280
Now, the State Department hasn't
answered any of my letters for weeks.

356
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:14,000
I mean, I don't even know
what prison he's being held in.

357
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:16,000
Well, he's not being held anymore.

358
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,520
He has escaped.

359
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:20,040
When? A week ago.

360
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:23,240
It was a prison break organized by
the terrorist group he's working with.

361
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:25,240
What are you talking about?

362
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,040
I mean, this whole
thing is a mistake.

363
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:30,040
I'm afraid it's not,
ma'am. We have evidence.

364
00:34:30,120 --> 00:34:31,440
- What evidence?
- That's classified.

365
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,760
- I can't tell you that.
- Yeah, of course it is.

366
00:34:37,240 --> 00:34:40,560
You people are incredible.

367
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,320
How long has it been
since you've seen him?

368
00:34:43,360 --> 00:34:46,160
I don't remember.

369
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,600
If you want to help Samir,
you should talk to me.

370
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,240
Do you think that every
Muslim man is a terrorist?

371
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:52,800
On the contrary.

372
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:54,360
I am, however, looking
for those who are.

373
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:56,320
Now if you have any knowledge
of what he's been involved in,

374
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,040
you do have an obligation
to share that with me.

375
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:59,880
Are you charging me with anything?

376
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:00,960
No, I'm not.

377
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,840
When you have something
more than secret evidence,

378
00:35:02,920 --> 00:35:04,080
then I'll talk to you.

379
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,920
Uh, they just fired
him. No explanation.

380
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,560
But, uh, it was pretty obvious why.

381
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:14,440
How did Samir take it?

382
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,960
How do you think?

383
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,520
So why did you let Mr. Horn go?

384
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,720
Jeez, that was over a year ago.

385
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:21,360
I don't recall the details.

386
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,200
The information that we gather for
these types of background checks

387
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,200
is strictly confidential.

388
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,480
Look, as far as I'm concerned,

389
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,360
a man's religion
is his own business.

390
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:34,000
But when you wear a skullcap and
pray to Allah five times a day,

391
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,960
people are gonna notice.

392
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,560
Some of our clients complained.

393
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:00,440
Horn gets to Chicago when he's 12.

394
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:02,800
He's just watched his father
die. He's arrived from Sudan.

395
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,400
He's going through culture
shock. It's a classic profile.

396
00:36:05,480 --> 00:36:07,440
He's caught between
traditional Islam and the West.

397
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,920
His test scores are off the charts.

398
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,920
But it said he had some
behavioral problems.

399
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,800
He was kicked out of high school his
senior year for getting into a fight.

400
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,800
About what?

401
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,600
Three white students were
harassing a black girl.

402
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,760
Horn intervened.

403
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,440
Two of the boys had
to be hospitalized.

404
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,560
Now he enlisted in the
military right after that.

405
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,680
His Army file was classified.

406
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,600
But here's a copy.

407
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,200
After he leaves the Army,
Horn fights in Afghanistan

408
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,520
for a few years.

409
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:34,160
The list of people he could have met there is
practically a who's who of Islamic terrorists,

410
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,080
from Abdul Azim to Osama bin Laden.

411
00:36:36,120 --> 00:36:38,520
Now we pretty much lose track of
him until he shows up in Bosnia

412
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:40,760
where he meets Chandra
Dawkin, the photojournalist.

413
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,600
- Is she a spy?
- No.

414
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,000
The FBl tried to question her,

415
00:36:44,080 --> 00:36:46,440
but my source says
she was uncooperative.

416
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,160
Last fall is when
things seemed to change.

417
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,080
He loses his job, spends more
and more time at the mosque.

418
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:54,400
Then he begins disappearing
on these long trips overseas.

419
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,880
Last one he never comes back from.

420
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,800
And somewhere along the
way he meets up with someone

421
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,840
who's connected with
Nathir and bingo!

422
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,040
You got yourself a terrorist.

423
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,080
Boom!

424
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,280
If this were the real thing, he
could have blown everybody up.

425
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:35,760
Come on, Omar. This
kid is too young.

426
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,120
He's not ready. I'm telling you.

427
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,680
I'm sorry. Let me try again.

428
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:40,800
No. Nobody cares
about you being sorry.

429
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:43,640
We cannot have mistakes. We can't
play around with this shit, Omar.

430
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,440
Bring me somebody who can do it.

431
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,440
Please. I can do
this. Give me a chance.

432
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:49,880
Is this mission important or not?

433
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:51,120
'Cause if it's important,
you need to bring-

434
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,240
Samir.

435
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:55,200
Let him try again.

436
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,240
Turn around.

437
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,640
All right. Let's see what you have.

438
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:52,160
There's a copy of the transcript
printing out for you know, sir.

439
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,680
I got something.

440
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,960
This guy made a call yesterday
from a phone in Marseilles

441
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:56,920
that we've been sitting on.

442
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,440
<i>Claims he's been
selected to become shahid.</i>

443
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,800
You picking up a little Arabic?

444
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,280
Ah, just your basic "Jihady".

445
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:04,480
Now Clayton, this one's operational.

446
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,040
This cat thinks he's gonna be in
Paradise by the end of the week.

447
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:33,480
Brothers, I know how
proud everybody is

448
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:35,640
about what we're going to do.

449
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:39,240
It's an honor to carry
out a mission like this.

450
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:41,920
But we have a problem.

451
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,720
Somebody talked about it.

452
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:10,040
Hey, guys. I'm sorry.

453
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:12,640
It was just my cousin.

454
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:16,160
Omar, I didn't tell
him anything specific.

455
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:22,320
I just wanted him to
know, to tell my family.

456
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,920
Omar, he can be trusted. I swear.

457
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,080
It wasn't for you to decide.

458
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:36,760
Okay. Okay.

459
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,880
It will never happen again.

460
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:58,240
Omar. Wait a minute.

461
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,400
Don't let them
- Guys, hey!

462
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:04,880
Bashir!

463
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,520
<i>No! Laissez-moi!</i>

464
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,280
<i>Laissez-moi!</i>

465
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,680
No!

466
00:41:26,360 --> 00:41:29,880
Hey, stupid! You just
ruined the mission.

467
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,640
What the hell is wrong with you?

468
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,680
You gonna put the bomb on now?

469
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:36,120
Listen to me.

470
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,320
The boy was a liability.

471
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:43,120
Samir, we don't allow liabilities.

472
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,440
We are very happy to welcome
you, but it was not necessary

473
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:19,440
for you to come all the way
here over one phone call.

474
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:22,320
We have reason to believe that
this particular phone booth

475
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:24,280
has been used by Nathir's
operatives in the past.

476
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,960
This could very well be
their next suicide bomber.

477
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
Thank you for the
information, monsieur,

478
00:42:29,080 --> 00:42:32,040
but the situation is under
control, I assure you.

479
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,040
We didn't come here to play tourists.
We came here to stop an attack.

480
00:42:39,120 --> 00:42:42,160
So can we please dispense
with the horse shit?

481
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:47,360
Okay.

482
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:54,040
Ali Abbas Mukhtar.

483
00:42:54,120 --> 00:42:55,800
He was born in Marseilles.

484
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:58,480
French citizen. 17 years old.

485
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,440
But... no longer a threat.

486
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,200
Why is that?

487
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:11,280
He was found dead Tuesday morning.

488
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,080
Omar.

489
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:31,680
Nathir is angry.

490
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:33,720
He wanted this thing
to go forward on time.

491
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,240
Well, it can still happen.

492
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:39,080
We have to start over.

493
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,720
A new target, a new bomber.

494
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:42,720
Look, a new target, yeah. But for-

495
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,840
<i>Bonjour.</i>

496
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:49,880
Look, I've been thinking about this.

497
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,320
I want to use a remote trigger.

498
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:55,720
Do you know how important
this mission is, Samir?

499
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,080
Nathir is watching.
He has plan for you.

500
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,760
He knows who I am?

501
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,360
So tell me your idea.

502
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,400
The American Consulate in Nice.

503
00:46:50,080 --> 00:46:51,520
<i>The American Consulate in Nice</i>

504
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,840
<i>has sustained major damage
in a bombing earlier today.</i>

505
00:46:54,920 --> 00:46:58,600
<i>Police are still searching the site for
the body of a suspected suicide bomber.</i>

506
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:02,240
<i>This attack bears all the hallmarks
of other blasts earlier this year</i>

507
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:05,840
<i>conducted by a group

<i>Three or more charges</i>

00:47:12,200 --> 00:47:15,400
<i>of high-impact
explosives were placed...</i>

510
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:35,200
Samir.

511
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:36,880
<i>- As-Salamu Alaykum, my
friend. - Wa alaikum assalam.</i>

512
00:47:36,920 --> 00:47:38,960
- Welcome back.
- Thank you.

513
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:41,320
Congratulations,
Samir. Job well done.

514
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,960
The glory belongs to Allah.

515
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,280
Look.

516
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,120
<i>...American Consulate here in Nice,</i>

What's the matter?

522
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:59,680
Eight?

523
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:04,400
I
- I thought there would be more, many more.

524
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:06,960
My brother, congratulations
are in order.

525
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:08,440
What you have done is fantastic.

526
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:12,560
Today you have struck a great blow
against the myth of American power.

527
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,680
Nathir is pleased.

528
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:17,560
I only wish to serve his will.

529
00:48:17,640 --> 00:48:19,600
That's good to know.

530
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:22,040
But tonight, you relax.

531
00:48:22,080 --> 00:48:24,360
Please, make yourself at home.

532
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:37,600
There you are, my brother.

533
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,480
Nice view, huh?

534
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,960
Yeah.

535
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:42,960
What you did, Samir,

536
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,560
what we are doing-

537
00:48:44,640 --> 00:48:47,320
it's all about setting
our people free.

538
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,920
Even if you and I
don't live to see it.

539
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:55,120
If a man hasn't discovered something

540
00:48:55,160 --> 00:48:57,400
that he will die for,

541
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,400
he isn't fit to live.

542
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,160
Who said that?

543
00:49:04,240 --> 00:49:05,880
Martin Luther King.

544
00:49:06,840 --> 00:49:08,880
Ah.

545
00:49:11,360 --> 00:49:14,240
You're a very funny man, Samir.

546
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,560
Yeah.

547
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,560
Lab results are back.

548
00:49:44,640 --> 00:49:47,000
Traces of PETN, RDX.

549
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,240
Semtex again.

550
00:49:48,280 --> 00:49:50,640
Just like the other Nathir attacks.

551
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:52,600
Except all the other
attacks were suicide bombers,

552
00:49:52,680 --> 00:49:54,560
and this looks like it's
from an RF Receiver, hmm?

553
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:55,760
Yes.

554
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:57,320
He used small charges.

555
00:49:57,400 --> 00:49:59,560
One...

556
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:00,600
and two.

557
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:03,680
But just in the correct place
to make collapse the building.

558
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:05,720
This man, he knows what he's doing.

559
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:09,040
RF range is usually no
more than a hundred meters,

560
00:50:09,080 --> 00:50:10,840
so let's pull the tapes
for all the security cameras

561
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:12,880
within a five-block radius.

562
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:16,240
No one there. Keep going.

563
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:17,240
More.

564
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,280
Back it up right there.

565
00:52:00,240 --> 00:52:01,720
What happened?

566
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:03,520
There were no Americans inside.

567
00:52:03,600 --> 00:52:05,600
The two dead embassy
employees were fakes,

568
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:07,440
bodies from the morgue
with false identities

569
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:08,440
just like we talked about.

570
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:09,920
Why is the news saying eight people?

571
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:12,640
There was some unscheduled
maintenance in a part of the consulate

572
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:15,560
that was supposed to
be empty, all right?

573
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,520
I didn't know they'd be there.

574
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:19,920
Listen, we couldn't
control everything.

575
00:52:19,960 --> 00:52:22,840
Nobody was supposed to
die! I'm sorry, Samir.

576
00:52:33,560 --> 00:52:35,600
Look, what do you want me to say?

577
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:36,760
We set off a bomb.

578
00:52:36,840 --> 00:52:39,120
No, I set off a bomb.

579
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,280
Look, I know you paid
a price to get this far.

580
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:56,240
Okay? You're close.

581
00:52:56,280 --> 00:52:59,240
You're very close.

582
00:53:02,520 --> 00:53:04,920
I don't know, man. You tell me.

583
00:53:06,440 --> 00:53:08,080
Do we stop?

584
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,320
What made you learn Arabic?

585
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,040
I took a class in
college and got hooked.

586
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:33,200
I even switched my major from
Religion to Arabic Studies.

587
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:35,800
You were a Religion major?

588
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:37,520
My daddy was a Baptist minister.

589
00:54:37,560 --> 00:54:40,080
His daddy was a Baptist minister.

590
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,360
It's in the blood.

591
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:44,440
You know, when J.
Edgar were in office,

592
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:47,080
he never would have
let you into the FBl.

593
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,760
Wasn't my original plan.

594
00:54:48,840 --> 00:54:52,600
Not a lot of jobs, however,
for Ph. D.s in Arabic Studies.

595
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:53,920
Oh, I get it now.

596
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:56,960
You were an egghead who got
dragged into a street fight.

597
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,680
Nobody gets dragged
into a street fight.

598
00:55:26,840 --> 00:55:29,200
Welcome to Toronto, Brother Samir.

599
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:31,240
It's a great honor, Emir.

600
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:32,600
Please, sit.

601
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:33,880
Thank you.

602
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:39,480
- Tea?
- Yes, thank you.

603
00:55:42,920 --> 00:55:46,440
Omar tells me that you play chess.

604
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:48,200
Only a little. Thank you.

605
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,840
In chess and in war,
the key to winning

606
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:53,960
is to anticipate what your
opponent will do in advance.

607
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:56,280
Think two moves ahead.

608
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:58,520
The art of asymmetrical warfare

609
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:03,320
is less about inflicting damage
than provoking a response.

610
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,560
Terrorism is theater.

611
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:09,320
And theater is always
performed for an audience.

612
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,040
Ours is the American people.

613
00:56:12,120 --> 00:56:17,840
But we are dispersed
across a large country.

614
00:56:17,880 --> 00:56:19,760
The question is,

615
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:23,400
how to convince them
that nowhere is safe.

616
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,040
Samir, imagine a bus
traveling cross-country

617
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:28,760
filled with average,
everyday Americans.

618
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:30,200
People from
- from all over.

619
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:32,840
From small towns, from the country.

620
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:34,840
Imagine the effect it would have

621
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:39,480
if that very same bus
were to suddenly explode.

622
00:56:39,560 --> 00:56:41,960
Now multiply that by 50.

623
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:46,080
Fifty buses across the
heartland of America,

624
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,800
all at the same time,

625
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,280
on the same day.

626
00:56:50,360 --> 00:56:54,800
<i>We call this operation
Risala Shukra Al-hiba.</i>

627
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:57,240
For years we've been planting
martyrs in their midst.

628
00:56:58,680 --> 00:57:00,640
They are waiting for a signal,

629
00:57:00,720 --> 00:57:03,600
instructions, material.

630
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:09,120
We need somebody who can move about
the country without drawing attention.

631
00:57:09,200 --> 00:57:12,280
Somebody who blends in.

632
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,520
An American messenger, Samir.

633
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,520
He isn't capable of this.

634
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:36,080
I don't like having to
show these to you, Chandra.

635
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:39,000
But we need to find him
before this happens again.

636
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:44,040
Samir always said that these
people were Islam's worse enemies.

637
00:57:44,120 --> 00:57:46,560
Oh, he fought a Holy War with
these folks in Afghanistan

638
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,440
and then again in Bosnia.

639
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,360
He was trained to kill.

640
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,880
He was a soldier, not a murderer.

641
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:57,600
I believe he deceived you
as much as anybody else.

642
00:58:01,240 --> 00:58:05,680
His faith was a source of strength.

643
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,360
Not this.

644
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,480
- Welcome to the U.S.
- Thanks.

645
00:58:58,000 --> 00:58:59,840
I'm a friend of Nassim's.

646
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:02,160
I'm here to see Iqbal.

647
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,600
<i>Shukran.</i>

648
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,800
<i>They transferred the funds for the
Spain bombing the Middle Eastern way.</i>

649
00:59:29,880 --> 00:59:33,520
<i>You give a thousand Euros
to somebody in one city</i>

650
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,560
<i>and their cousin or
uncle pays it in the-</i>

651
00:59:35,640 --> 00:59:38,960
<i>Thank you, Mr. Hayes, we do
know what a hawala network is.</i>

652
00:59:39,040 --> 00:59:40,840
<i>The money trail ended in London.</i>

653
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,120
<i>A Pakistani with some
shady business dealings</i>

654
00:59:43,160 --> 00:59:45,680
<i>was the source of the money
for the Spain operation.</i>

655
00:59:45,760 --> 00:59:48,760
<i>Yesterday he transferred
$25,000 to Los Angeles.</i>

656
00:59:48,840 --> 00:59:50,360
Do you have an ID on him?

657
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:53,840
<i>We're close.</i>

658
01:00:26,360 --> 01:00:28,760
That's an encrypted phone.
You can call me on it safely.

659
01:00:28,800 --> 01:00:30,240
Nobody can listen in.

660
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:32,240
Including the FBl?

661
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:35,360
Yeah. Especially the FBl.

662
01:00:36,360 --> 01:00:39,240
When do you think you can get
in a room with Nathir again?

663
01:00:39,320 --> 01:00:40,240
I don't know.

664
01:00:40,280 --> 01:00:43,120
Probably not until I do what
it is they sent me to do.

665
01:00:43,160 --> 01:00:44,440
Then you keep on going.

666
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:46,840
Well, the problem is,
to keep going means

667
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,240
I'm going to have to put real
bombs in their hands now soon.

668
01:00:49,320 --> 01:00:51,880
If that what it takes
to keep your cover.

669
01:00:57,000 --> 01:01:00,080
Do you realize how far I've gone
to protect your identity, Samir?

670
01:01:00,120 --> 01:01:02,600
I have kept you
completely off the books.

671
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:06,000
My boss, his boss
- nobody knows you even exist.

672
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,120
Look, I don't give a shit
about any of that, okay?

673
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,760
We need to rethink things.

674
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:13,200
If you don't succeed, we
may not get another chance.

675
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:19,520
How far are you
willing to take this?

676
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:21,680
We've got blood on our hands.

677
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:23,120
We've killed innocent people.

678
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:26,080
Yeah, and if we stop now,
they'll have died for nothing.

679
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,920
This is a war.

680
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:30,160
You do what it takes to win.

681
01:01:35,680 --> 01:01:37,680
You know who you sound like, right?

682
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:38,800
We're the good guys, Samir.

683
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:40,480
Oh, I know.

684
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,320
Hey!

685
01:01:44,400 --> 01:01:46,400
Remember who you answer to.

686
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,040
I answer to God. We all do.

687
01:02:01,920 --> 01:02:03,560
- Any problem?
- No.

688
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:29,160
Omar. Omar, Omar! Don't! Don't!

689
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:32,400
Can't blow up unless
there's a detonator in it.

690
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:35,040
- Don't worry.
- It still makes me nervous.

691
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:40,560
We gotta talk about how we're
gonna send these e-mails.

692
01:02:40,600 --> 01:02:42,760
What do you mean? I thought
we decided to use coded e-mail.

693
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:43,920
No, no, we did. We did.

694
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:45,600
But the problem is e-mails
can get intercepted.

695
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:48,080
I got a better idea.

696
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:51,760
We're gonna give each of our people an
e-mail account and a password. All right?

697
01:02:51,800 --> 01:02:54,200
Then when we're ready to
go, we log onto each one,

698
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:56,760
we write the instructions,
but we don't send them.

699
01:02:56,840 --> 01:02:58,160
We save it as a draft.

700
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:02,040
The next morning they log on,
they check their unsent messages.

701
01:03:02,120 --> 01:03:03,040
Nothing is sent.

702
01:03:03,120 --> 01:03:04,840
There's nothing for
the FBl to intercept.

703
01:03:04,920 --> 01:03:07,000
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I like this.

704
01:03:07,080 --> 01:03:08,760
Here are the names.

705
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,760
There's only ten.

706
01:03:13,840 --> 01:03:16,120
We don't risk putting
them all on one list.

707
01:03:16,200 --> 01:03:18,480
None of them even knows
that the other exists.

708
01:03:18,520 --> 01:03:21,600
Ah. I like that.

709
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:45,560
<i>As-Salamu Alaykum, sister.</i>

710
01:04:27,480 --> 01:04:29,800
Sorry.

711
01:04:29,880 --> 01:04:31,440
That's okay.

712
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:33,640
They want that file
translated right away.

713
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:34,920
Sure.

714
01:04:37,760 --> 01:04:39,640
From British Intelligence, huh?

715
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,000
Yeah.

716
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:43,960
Good night. Good night.

717
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,760
You have to get out, now.

718
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:56,160
Leave nothing.

719
01:07:14,360 --> 01:07:17,200
Hold it right there!

720
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:18,800
Get your hands up!

721
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:20,720
Right there! Against the wall!

722
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:33,120
Mr. Raman, how are you?

723
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:35,800
Perhaps you haven't had time to read
the fine print of the Patriot Act,

724
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:38,000
but any person operating a
money transmitting business

725
01:07:38,080 --> 01:07:39,320
must register with
the U.S. government.

726
01:07:39,400 --> 01:07:41,480
Something you neglected
to do, Mr. Raman.

727
01:07:41,560 --> 01:07:43,680
Now each transfer
in excess of $10,000

728
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,160
can be treated as a separate felony

729
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:47,800
and each count is punishable
by up to five years in prison.

730
01:07:47,880 --> 01:07:49,280
And you moved over $2 million.

731
01:07:49,360 --> 01:07:51,200
I mean, you are the money
guy. You can do the math.

732
01:07:51,280 --> 01:07:54,360
Now if you choose to cooperate, the
charges against you will be dropped.

733
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:56,160
The choice is yours.

734
01:07:56,240 --> 01:07:58,600
We'll give you five
minutes to think about it.

735
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:01,760
Wait!

736
01:08:32,160 --> 01:08:34,320
You having some car trouble?

737
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:35,640
Yeah, it was making a funny noise.

738
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,320
I think the radiator's loose.

739
01:08:38,440 --> 01:08:40,160
I got a toolbox.

740
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:53,760
I've been praying
for this day to come.

741
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,640
Your prayers have
been answered, brother.

742
01:09:00,200 --> 01:09:02,040
Now these go to the
trigger mechanisms.

743
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:05,160
All you have to do is attach
it to the power source.

744
01:09:11,120 --> 01:09:14,360
This e-mail account has your
final instructions on it.

745
01:10:05,960 --> 01:10:07,360
Chandra.

746
01:10:07,440 --> 01:10:08,760
- Samir!
- Don't, don't, don't, don't!

747
01:10:08,840 --> 01:10:10,600
Pretend we're not talking. They're
probably watching you right now.

748
01:10:10,680 --> 01:10:11,480
Just keep stretching.

749
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:13,480
Keep stretching.

750
01:10:16,080 --> 01:10:18,520
Samir, what's going on?

751
01:10:18,600 --> 01:10:21,400
I'm sorry. I never meant to
get you mixed up in all of this.

752
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:23,120
Mixed up in what?

753
01:10:23,160 --> 01:10:27,640
I mean... you didn't have anything to
do with that bombing in France, right?

754
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:37,120
Just keep stretching.

755
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:46,240
Samir, I need to know the truth.

756
01:10:46,320 --> 01:10:47,840
The truth is...

757
01:10:47,920 --> 01:10:49,600
it's complicated.

758
01:10:58,440 --> 01:11:00,160
Holy shit.

759
01:11:00,240 --> 01:11:01,480
Get on the radio.

760
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,720
Hey.

761
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:22,640
Did you do
- Did you do what they said?

762
01:11:26,960 --> 01:11:28,560
Yes.

763
01:11:37,760 --> 01:11:41,120
Then you just stop it. Okay?

764
01:11:41,200 --> 01:11:43,680
Whatever
- Whatever you're involved in.

765
01:11:43,760 --> 01:11:45,120
- Chandra- - Whatever
you're doing, you just-

766
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,760
Chandra, listen to me. I can't
stop and I'm not coming back.

767
01:11:47,800 --> 01:11:50,200
You have to forget about
me. Just forget about me.

768
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:53,680
- No, Samir, listen to me-
Samir- - Let me go. Let me go.

769
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:02,320
We're on the ground.

770
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:05,440
No, just keep him in your
sight, but don't move on him yet.

771
01:12:05,520 --> 01:12:06,600
We're on our way.

772
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,880
We're at 128 South Randolph Avenue.

773
01:13:12,960 --> 01:13:15,840
Continuing surveillance undetected
is going to be a problem.

774
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:36,400
We think he entered
that building there, sir.

775
01:13:36,440 --> 01:13:37,400
Who followed him in?

776
01:13:37,480 --> 01:13:39,840
Uh, we were waiting for backup.

777
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:41,480
You two go around
back. You take the side.

778
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:42,520
Come on. Let's go.

779
01:13:52,160 --> 01:13:54,440
It's all right. We're
not here for you, fellows.

780
01:14:02,760 --> 01:14:04,560
- I'll take the rooftop.
- Okay.

781
01:14:36,480 --> 01:14:37,680
Ohh!

782
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:02,840
Agent Clayton.

783
01:15:02,920 --> 01:15:05,040
You're a persistent son
of a bitch, aren't you?

784
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:07,360
You're a hard man to catch.

785
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:08,840
Turn around!

786
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:14,160
Not too late, Samir. We
can work something out.

787
01:15:14,200 --> 01:15:17,880
Tell 'em to stay put.
You're coming out.

788
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:19,320
Basement's clear. I'm coming out.

789
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:21,520
<i>Copy that.</i>

790
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:23,960
We have something in common.
My father's a man of God, too.

791
01:15:24,040 --> 01:15:27,200
Yeah? We're practically brothers.

792
01:15:27,280 --> 01:15:29,640
Sit on your hands.

793
01:15:29,720 --> 01:15:31,600
Sit on 'em.

794
01:15:31,680 --> 01:15:33,680
I've read some of your
father's teachings.

795
01:15:33,720 --> 01:15:35,120
He's a man of great integrity.

796
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:41,000
How'd you stray so far
from his way of thinking?

797
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:47,600
- Your father was a preacher?
- Oh, yeah.

798
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:50,400
Then you know the Lord's Prayer.

799
01:15:50,480 --> 01:15:52,000
Say it.

800
01:15:55,040 --> 01:15:56,400
Say it.

801
01:16:02,080 --> 01:16:03,400
Our Father, who art in Heaven,

802
01:16:03,480 --> 01:16:05,480
hallowed be Thy name.

803
01:16:05,560 --> 01:16:07,360
Thy kingdom come-

804
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:14,360
Ohh.

805
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,720
He's gone.

806
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:27,080
And we had guys
everywhere looking for him.

807
01:16:27,160 --> 01:16:28,120
But those basement tunnels-

808
01:16:28,200 --> 01:16:30,280
they run under five
city blocks of buildings.

809
01:16:30,360 --> 01:16:32,000
Yeah. He knew that, too.

810
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:34,360
He used to live there.

811
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:36,200
128 South Randolph.

812
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:39,600
It was in his file.
It didn't occur to me.

813
01:16:39,640 --> 01:16:41,520
I wonder why he let you live.

814
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,840
Because I didn't try to beat
the crap out of him like you did.

815
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,720
Carter, you put a tracker on me?

816
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:00,080
- Are you crazy?
- The FBl's all over you.

817
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,200
- I'm on a meet!
- Come with me.

818
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:03,080
I'm on a meet, Carter!

819
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:09,520
Shit. Push me. Push me!

820
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:44,600
Let's go!

821
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,640
What the hell happened?

822
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:11,600
Who was that? It was a cop.

823
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:16,840
I went to see a woman.
An old girlfriend of mine.

824
01:18:16,920 --> 01:18:19,280
And
- And they were watching her, and then the dude jumped on me.

825
01:18:19,320 --> 01:18:21,720
I didn't even know he was
there until I got to the-

826
01:18:24,240 --> 01:18:27,280
We have to get out of
the country tonight.

827
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:29,560
We've only made contact
with 30 of the bombers.

828
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:33,080
You better hope that's enough.

829
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:38,920
And when we see Fareed, let me talk.

830
01:18:42,080 --> 01:18:44,240
Put your seatbelt on.

831
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:53,080
This is the car Horn
stole from the projects.

832
01:18:53,160 --> 01:18:55,800
Two of the shell casings
have his prints on them.

833
01:18:55,880 --> 01:18:58,320
The body's over here.

834
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,040
You say you had a federal ID on him?

835
01:19:00,120 --> 01:19:03,440
Yeah. Intelligence contractor.

836
01:20:03,960 --> 01:20:07,040
<i>As-Salamu Alaykum, Brother Fareed.</i>

837
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,720
<i>Wa alaikum assalam, Omar.</i>

838
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:12,360
<i>- As-Salamu Alaykum. -
Wa alaikum assalam, Samir.</i>

839
01:20:13,800 --> 01:20:15,320
Good trip?

840
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:18,280
Um... we had a problem.

841
01:20:18,360 --> 01:20:20,720
Samir has made a small mistake.

842
01:20:20,760 --> 01:20:23,160
- He went to see a
woman- - Chandra Dawkin?

843
01:20:26,440 --> 01:20:30,200
Yeah, Chandra Dawkin. Listen-

844
01:20:30,280 --> 01:20:33,880
Yeah, but Fareed, the important thing is
that he carried out his mission successfully.

845
01:20:33,960 --> 01:20:36,560
The important thing is...

846
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:38,640
that she was cooperating
with Federal agents.

847
01:20:39,920 --> 01:20:42,280
No. No.

848
01:20:42,360 --> 01:20:44,320
That's
- I'm sorry. You're mistaken, Brother Fareed.

849
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:46,960
I'm not mistaken.

850
01:20:47,000 --> 01:20:48,840
We have a source inside the FBl.

851
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:50,240
Well then your source is mistaken.

852
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:53,360
There's
- No. She would never do that. I've known this woman for years.

853
01:20:59,160 --> 01:21:01,240
Show Samir to his room please.

854
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:06,120
Omar and I need to talk alone.

855
01:21:19,880 --> 01:21:22,240
Yeah, but he's an integral
part of our mission, Fareed.

856
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:25,000
Yes. But going to see the
woman has put us in jeopardy.

857
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:26,760
Oh, come on, man.

858
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:28,680
Who amongst us hasn't
faced temptation?

859
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:31,400
This isn't about temptation, Omar.

860
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:33,200
It's about security.

861
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,440
Leave aside your friendship

862
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,680
for just one moment,
my brother, and think.

863
01:21:43,760 --> 01:21:46,320
Think sensibly.

864
01:21:46,360 --> 01:21:48,720
What if he did it deliberately, huh?

865
01:21:51,240 --> 01:21:55,160
Unfortunately his actions
have left us with a doubt.

866
01:21:55,240 --> 01:21:57,000
And what does that mean?

867
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:06,080
We eliminate all doubts.

868
01:22:07,680 --> 01:22:10,160
Ml5 has recovered some
files from a hard drive

869
01:22:10,240 --> 01:22:12,320
in Nathir's London safe house.

870
01:22:12,400 --> 01:22:14,800
One of them has a
record of an operation-

871
01:22:14,840 --> 01:22:16,840
<i>Risala Shukra Al-hiba.</i>

872
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:18,400
Where have I heard that before?

873
01:22:18,480 --> 01:22:19,560
Our phone intercept.

874
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:21,880
Your intercept only picked up
the first part of the code name.

875
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:24,600
The date of the attack is
in the full name. Leyla?

876
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:25,960
<i>"Risala" means "message,"</i>

877
01:22:26,040 --> 01:22:28,760
<i>"Shukra" means "thanks" and
"Al-hiba" is "the gift. "</i>

878
01:22:28,800 --> 01:22:31,920
So the literal translation is
"Message of thanks for the gift. "

879
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:33,800
Thanksgiving.

880
01:22:33,880 --> 01:22:35,840
Exactly. That's when
they're gonna strike.

881
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,640
In two days time.

882
01:22:37,720 --> 01:22:39,000
What about the target?

883
01:22:39,080 --> 01:22:41,200
Well, we found traces
of Semtex in the vehicle

884
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:42,720
Horn abandoned in Chicago.

885
01:22:42,800 --> 01:22:44,680
But that was purchased
in California a month ago.

886
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:48,720
And he could have been distributing bombs
right across the entire country by now.

887
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:53,040
We'll raise the threat level.

888
01:22:53,080 --> 01:22:55,960
Double up protection on bridges,
airports, monuments, the White House.

889
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:59,680
Sir, I would also suggest that we place
Horn on the high-value target list, too.

890
01:22:59,760 --> 01:23:01,200
He killed a good man.

891
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:03,400
You're not going to get
any objections from us.

892
01:23:21,880 --> 01:23:24,680
- You let me win, Omar.
- No.

893
01:23:24,760 --> 01:23:27,920
No, I swear.

894
01:23:27,960 --> 01:23:29,160
You've gotten better, my friend.

895
01:23:29,240 --> 01:23:30,760
Please, don't bullshit me.

896
01:23:30,840 --> 01:23:34,160
You beat me enough times for me to
know when you're throwing a game.

897
01:23:42,440 --> 01:23:44,720
Fareed has made up his mind.

898
01:23:48,280 --> 01:23:51,280
Sorry. It's not your fault.

899
01:23:51,320 --> 01:23:52,880
I did this.

900
01:23:55,080 --> 01:23:56,840
We're only men, my friend.

901
01:23:59,080 --> 01:24:01,280
I have a girl in Paris, Samir.

902
01:24:01,360 --> 01:24:04,840
Beautiful. Beautiful.

903
01:24:04,920 --> 01:24:07,760
She thinks I'm a music producer.

904
01:24:07,800 --> 01:24:10,600
You know, it's true what they say.

905
01:24:10,680 --> 01:24:12,760
War is the lesser jihad.

906
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:16,920
To overcome temptation,
to live rightly,

907
01:24:17,000 --> 01:24:19,800
that is the great jihad.

908
01:24:23,800 --> 01:24:26,080
And is that what we've been doing?

909
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:33,400
You ever ask yourself that?

910
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:39,680
Sometimes.

911
01:24:39,760 --> 01:24:41,680
But Nathir is the leader.

912
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:44,200
And my duty is to follow.

913
01:24:45,440 --> 01:24:48,000
Come, let's pray.

914
01:25:02,520 --> 01:25:06,000
We've just received word
from our source in Washington.

915
01:25:06,040 --> 01:25:08,360
It appears you're on the
high-value target list.

916
01:25:08,440 --> 01:25:11,200
What is that? What does that mean?

917
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,360
It means I owe you
an apology, Samir.

918
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:16,200
<i>That means that the American
government has put a fatwa on you.</i>

919
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:19,000
They want you dead.

920
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:35,720
Hang on. This is
- The system's running really slow.

921
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:41,360
We need to get back on the road
and make it to Halifax by tonight.

922
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:43,120
Halifax?

923
01:25:46,920 --> 01:25:49,720
They will be looking for
us big time after tomorrow.

924
01:25:49,800 --> 01:25:53,400
We'll be cruising
across the ocean by then.

925
01:25:53,480 --> 01:25:54,640
All of us.

926
01:26:08,080 --> 01:26:09,600
Computer's frozen.

927
01:26:09,680 --> 01:26:11,000
What?

928
01:26:11,080 --> 01:26:12,720
Jeez, I gotta reboot
the whole thing.

929
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:14,520
- What do you mean?
- Good God.

930
01:26:14,600 --> 01:26:16,720
- I gotta get some coffee.
- No, no, no. You stay here.

931
01:26:16,800 --> 01:26:18,080
I'll get it.

932
01:26:18,160 --> 01:26:21,440
Make sure you get the
numbers exactly right.

933
01:26:21,520 --> 01:26:24,240
I want each person on
the road at the same time.

934
01:26:24,280 --> 01:26:25,640
Got it.

935
01:27:17,760 --> 01:27:20,360
That's it.

936
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:21,920
- Done?
- Yeah, we're good.

937
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:23,680
Let's go.

938
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,440
Aah.

939
01:29:55,720 --> 01:29:57,400
You've got to be shitting me.

940
01:29:57,480 --> 01:30:00,680
The U.S. is going to be attacked today and
we just arrived at the ass-end of Canada.

941
01:30:00,760 --> 01:30:02,040
- Roy Clayton?
- Yeah.

942
01:30:02,120 --> 01:30:03,720
This fax came for you.

943
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:05,320
What is it?

944
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,560
The county records for the
two State Department employees

945
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,520
killed at the consulate
bombing in Nice.

946
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:12,360
Well, these people died as infants.

947
01:30:12,440 --> 01:30:14,560
Wait a sec.

948
01:30:14,640 --> 01:30:16,440
These deaths are fake.

949
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:17,960
Yeah.

950
01:31:55,240 --> 01:31:56,880
A few dozen ships in port right now,

951
01:31:56,960 --> 01:31:58,760
but only these five are
scheduled to head out today.

952
01:31:58,840 --> 01:32:00,560
All right, all these ships
are destined for U.S. ports

953
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:01,840
<i>except for this one
- The Ivory Star.</i>

954
01:32:01,920 --> 01:32:03,920
- It's a tanker registered out of Aden.
- Yemen?

955
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:05,200
- That's gotta be it.
- That's gotta be it.

956
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:08,360
You want to board her, we'll need an
official request from the FBl in Washington.

957
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,880
We go through HQ, this information's
gonna get leaked right back.

958
01:32:10,960 --> 01:32:12,000
Wait a minute.

959
01:32:12,080 --> 01:32:15,080
Customs can search any ship that it wants
if it thinks it has drugs on board, right?

960
01:32:15,160 --> 01:32:16,400
You have any friends
left in Narcotics?

961
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:18,440
We'll soon find out.

962
01:33:22,040 --> 01:33:23,840
Good to see you.

963
01:33:23,920 --> 01:33:26,000
Welcome, my friend.

964
01:33:26,040 --> 01:33:27,560
This is going to be a great day.

965
01:34:10,560 --> 01:34:12,320
It's almost time.

966
01:34:23,040 --> 01:34:26,960
The Americans love to brag about how
their government represents the people.

967
01:34:27,040 --> 01:34:31,360
So we should accept that every
American shares equal responsibility

968
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:33,800
for their government's crimes.

969
01:34:33,880 --> 01:34:36,760
Nobody is innocent.

970
01:34:36,840 --> 01:34:38,280
We're leaving harbor soon, Emir.

971
01:34:38,360 --> 01:34:40,120
We have to stay below
decks for a while.

972
01:34:40,200 --> 01:34:42,200
What's the matter with you?

973
01:34:42,280 --> 01:34:45,480
Uh, I'm getting a little seasick.

974
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:49,280
I think I need to take
some air. May I, Emir?

975
01:34:57,640 --> 01:35:00,440
- You're the head of security, brother?
- Yes, sir.

976
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,440
And how many men in your
detail guarding the Emir?

977
01:35:02,520 --> 01:35:05,120
Seven crew members. Don't
worry. We're certainly safe.

978
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:50,840
Shit. Nothing.

979
01:35:50,920 --> 01:35:52,720
I think he's leading
us on a goose chase.

980
01:35:52,760 --> 01:35:53,840
That was the harbor master.

981
01:35:53,880 --> 01:35:56,440
There's one more ship going
into international waters today.

982
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:57,920
Cargo carrier headed for Marseilles.

983
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,120
Which one is it?

984
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:49,440
Samir?

985
01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:58,280
Wait, brother. Think
of your duty to-

986
01:37:00,040 --> 01:37:02,120
Omar! Omar! Omar!

987
01:37:02,200 --> 01:37:04,200
Don't shoot! Don't
shoot! Listen to me!

988
01:37:04,280 --> 01:37:05,640
What have you done, Samir?

989
01:37:05,720 --> 01:37:08,480
- I didn't come here to kill you, Omar.
- You are a traitor!

990
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:10,720
No! Nathir was the traitor.

991
01:37:10,800 --> 01:37:13,040
Fareed was the traitor.
They betrayed Islam!

992
01:37:13,120 --> 01:37:14,520
No! I don't want to listen to you!

993
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:17,400
- I'm gonna kill you, Samir!
- It doesn't matter.

994
01:37:17,440 --> 01:37:19,720
I was dead as soon as I
stepped foot on this ship.

995
01:37:19,800 --> 01:37:21,760
But I had to stop them.
I had to stop this-

996
01:37:21,840 --> 01:37:25,200
What the hell are you talking
about? You haven't stopped shit!

997
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:28,040
Thirty buses are going to explode!

998
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:43,080
<i>Allahu Akbarl</i>

999
01:37:43,160 --> 01:37:44,560
What are you doing?

1000
01:37:49,480 --> 01:37:50,280
Who are you?

1001
01:37:50,360 --> 01:37:53,640
<i>- Allahu Akbar, Allahu Akbar.
- Why are we on the same bus?</i>

1002
01:37:53,720 --> 01:37:55,120
What the hell are you doing?

1003
01:38:10,880 --> 01:38:13,040
I put them all on the same bus.

1004
01:38:16,040 --> 01:38:19,200
No. No, that can't be.

1005
01:38:19,280 --> 01:38:21,400
I saw you give them the bombs.

1006
01:38:21,480 --> 01:38:22,960
I saw the e-mails.

1007
01:38:23,000 --> 01:38:25,440
I changed the e-mails, Omar.

1008
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:31,600
It's over.

1009
01:38:39,640 --> 01:38:41,800
I put my trust on you.

1010
01:38:41,880 --> 01:38:44,200
I thought you were my brother!

1011
01:38:53,120 --> 01:38:55,280
Omar.

1012
01:39:01,880 --> 01:39:04,080
Omar.

1013
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:11,480
I am your brother.

1014
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:20,000
They used you, Omar.

1015
01:39:20,080 --> 01:39:22,520
They used me, too. All of them.

1016
01:39:22,600 --> 01:39:24,360
They used us for our faith.

1017
01:39:34,040 --> 01:39:35,200
Drop your weapon!

1018
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:36,240
Omar. Omar!

1019
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:41,520
Hold your fire. Hold your fire!

1020
01:39:48,440 --> 01:39:50,200
Samir?

1021
01:39:52,280 --> 01:39:53,520
Samir, where's Nathir?

1022
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:11,800
Hang in there, Samir.

1023
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:13,840
Call a paramedic.

1024
01:40:16,240 --> 01:40:18,000
It'll be okay.

1025
01:40:49,920 --> 01:40:51,400
Samir.

1026
01:40:54,520 --> 01:40:56,840
You wanna take a ride and talk?

1027
01:40:59,520 --> 01:41:01,760
We can talk right here.

1028
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:12,760
Good to see you up and about.

1029
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:14,960
Didn't know if you'd make it.

1030
01:41:15,000 --> 01:41:16,640
How's the shoulder?

1031
01:41:16,720 --> 01:41:19,160
I'll live.

1032
01:41:19,240 --> 01:41:21,600
I don't suspect anybody's
said this to you,

1033
01:41:21,680 --> 01:41:25,960
but this country
owes you a huge debt.

1034
01:41:26,040 --> 01:41:30,040
You came all the way out
here just to tell me that?

1035
01:41:30,120 --> 01:41:31,640
Come on, Clayton.
I'm going someplace.

1036
01:41:31,720 --> 01:41:33,000
What do you want?

1037
01:41:35,280 --> 01:41:37,400
I've had your file wiped clean.

1038
01:41:37,480 --> 01:41:38,680
Everything.

1039
01:41:38,760 --> 01:41:41,200
The bombing at France,
the bus, all of it.

1040
01:41:41,240 --> 01:41:45,560
Effectively, you're a free man but
there's still a lot that you can do for us.

1041
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:48,160
I'm a free man?

1042
01:41:48,240 --> 01:41:50,720
This doesn't feel like
freedom to me, Clayton.

1043
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:52,760
You think because you hit
"delete" on some computer somewhere

1044
01:41:52,840 --> 01:41:54,320
that that's it, it's over?

1045
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,160
I made choices about people's lives.

1046
01:41:56,240 --> 01:41:57,600
- And I gotta live with that.
- I understand.

1047
01:41:57,680 --> 01:41:59,400
- Forever, Clayton.
- I understand that.

1048
01:41:59,480 --> 01:42:02,720
But you and I both know that
this fight is far from over.

1049
01:42:07,080 --> 01:42:09,760
You know, the Qur'an says that
if you kill an innocent person,

1050
01:42:09,840 --> 01:42:12,480
it's as if you've
killed all mankind?

1051
01:42:16,440 --> 01:42:21,640
It also says that if you save a life,
it's like you've saved all mankind.

1052
01:42:21,720 --> 01:42:23,960
You're a hero, Samir.

1053
01:42:27,720 --> 01:42:31,240
Look, whatever you want to call me,

1054
01:42:31,320 --> 01:42:32,880
I'm done.

1055
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:38,240
Well, we know how
to find each other.

1056
01:42:41,680 --> 01:42:43,040
<i>As-Salamu Alaykum.</i>

1057
01:42:46,400 --> 01:42:48,000
<i>Wa alaikum assalam.</i>

1058
01:42:52,280 --> 01:42:55,120
And you should start the
conversation with that.
