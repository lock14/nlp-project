{1843}{1873}I think everyone is here.
{1875}{1942}If you'd all please take your seats,|we can get started.
{2198}{2291}George Fitch, Christmas Eve, Nanking,|China, 1937.
{2318}{2417}What I am about to relate is a story|which I feel must be told,
{2420}{2483}even if it is seen by only a few.
{2486}{2556}I cannot rest until I have told it and,|perhaps fortunately,
{2558}{2630}I am one of a very few|who are in a position to tell it.
{2648}{2717}It is not complete, only a part of the whole,
{2754}{2833}{y:i}and God alone knows|when it will be finished.
{2836}{2879}{y:i}I pray it may be soon,
{2882}{2989}{y:i}but I am afraid it is going to go on|for many months to come.
{3016}{3098}I believe it has no parallel|in modern history.
{3112}{3206}Bob Wilson.|I was born and grew up here in China.
{3209}{3253}My parents were both missionaries.
{3271}{3318}I went away to medical school at Harvard,
{3320}{3398}{y:i}but I came back here to live,|and practice medicine.
{3401}{3449}{y:i}Nanking is my home.
{3576}{3677}Minnie Vautrin. Dean of Ginling|Women's College in Nanking.
{3692}{3802}I'm from Secor, Illinois,|a small farming town on the prairie.
{3971}{4012}John Rabe.
{4014}{4088}I moved to China from Hamburg|on business, over 30 years ago.
{4103}{4155}I married my childhood sweetheart|from Germany,
{4158}{4213}and we raised our two children here.
{4216}{4289}For the last six years, I've been director|of Siemens China company,
{4292}{4337}here in Nanking, the capital.
{7618}{7686}{y:i}March of Time newsreel, August, 1937.
{7704}{7788}"Today, out of the Far East,|come grim messages of a new conflict."
{7813}{7890}{y:i}" The gory chronicle of Japan's war|to crush all of China..."
{7898}{7976}{y:i}and gain for herself|sole mastery of the Orient.
{8048}{8118}{y:i}Shanghai tastes war at its worst.
{8190}{8260}{y:i}For, in a war of today,|there is a new element:
{8262}{8308}{y:i}a fearsome, haphazard, modern fighting
{8310}{8420}{y:i}that takes its toll on peaceful cities|and their non-combatant populations.
{9226}{9287}We always knew Japan wanted China.
{9290}{9370}I knew it since I was little.|My parents always said,
{9373}{9488}"Japan wants to conquer China because|we have all the land and all the wealth."
{9490}{9540}{y:i}And we were right next door.
{9830}{9877}Everywhere, dugouts can be seen.
{9906}{9985}In some places,|they are as close as every 200 feet.
{10010}{10047}{y:i}Just as you would show|your rose garden
{10050}{10082}{y:i}to your friends when they call,
{10085}{10110}{y:i}now it's customary
{10113}{10206}{y:i}to take your friends to your trenches|and caves, to ask their opinion.
{11147}{11194}Today, we had a genuine thrill.
{11202}{11275}The first air raid|that any of us had ever experienced.
{11294}{11335}It probably won't be the last.
{14985}{15063}During the worst of the bombing,|on the 19th and 20th of September,
{15078}{15137}I sat with my Chinese|in our homemade dugout,
{15140}{15174}which is certainly not bomb-proof,
{15177}{15263}{y:i}but at least provides protection|against shrapnel and bomb fragments.
{15278}{15359}{y:i}Out in the garden, we've also spread|a 20-by-20-foot piece of canvas,
{15362}{15414}{y:i}with a swastika painted on it.
{15433}{15473}{y:i}In the long hours|of crouching in the dugout,
{15475}{15534}during the recent bombardment,|I turned on Radio Shanghai
{15537}{15603}to take my mind off things|with a little music.
{15606}{15677}And they were playing|Beethoven's "Funeral March"!
{15680}{15759}Then, to make matters worse,|they announced to their listeners,
{15762}{15870}"This music is kindly dedicated to you|by the Shanghai Funeral Directors."
{15904}{16003}{y:i}Most of the shops|on the business streets are locked,
{16006}{16075}and the city has a deserted and forlorn look.
{16086}{16185}The glances cast at me as much as say,|"What? Are you still here?"
{16252}{16342}{y:i}September 25th.|This has been a terrible day.
{16365}{16419}{y:i}Bombs seem to be raining around.
{16422}{16526}{y:i}Nanking was subjected|to three terrific air raids.
{16529}{16616}{y:i}The count of raids and alarms|has now risen to 39.
{16618}{16704}Gallons of civilian blood flowed today.
{17531}{17609}Under such circumstances, can I...
{17638}{17687}May I cut and run?
{17715}{17758}I don't think so.
{17777}{17877}Anyone who has ever sat in the dugout and|held a trembling Chinese child in each hand
{17879}{17972}through the long hours of an air raid|can understand what I feel.
{17985}{18080}The rich are fleeing.|The poor remain behind.
{18082}{18175}{y:i}They don't know where to go.|They don't have the means to flee.
{18180}{18262}{y:i}Aren't they in danger|of being slaughtered in great numbers?
{18265}{18332}{y:i}Shouldn't one make|an attempt to help them?
{18339}{18396}There's a question of morality here.
{18398}{18463}And, so far,|I haven't been able to sidestep it.
{19008}{19103}Tuesday evening, we took our entire|hospital staff to Shokwan Station,
{19106}{19186}where about 1,200 Chinese soldiers|lay around.
{19202}{19275}{y:i}We found the soldiers|scattered thickly at the station.
{19278}{19333}{y:i}Some men were in great agony.
{19336}{19421}{y:i}One of the men had his leg shot off|up near the hip.
{19450}{19492}{y:i}The wound had not been attended.
{19494}{19601}{y:i}The odor of his flesh,|I can never, never forget.
{19603}{19678}When I reached home,|I first washed with Lysol, and then soap,
{19681}{19721}but the odor still remained.
{19724}{19806}I used cold cream,|and then later perfume, but...
{19808}{19877}All day today, I am still conscious of it.
{20394}{20488}At 9:00 p.m., a letter came|by special messenger from the Embassy.
{20490}{20562}{y:i}They are asking all men and women|to evacuate Nanking.
{20590}{20655}{y:i}It was a very clear, emphatic statement.
{20812}{20859}{y:i}Standing offshore|from the doomed city is
{20862}{20941}{y:i}the United States gunboat Panay|of the Yangtze Patrol.
{20944}{21020}{y:i}Fleeing from the beleaguered city,|a number of Americans and others
{21022}{21100}{y:i}arrive at the riverside,|hoping to get aboard the Panay.
{21102}{21203}{y:i}Diplomats representing the United States|government pack important state papers
{21206}{21317}{y:i}and head for the Panay in cars prominently|marked with the American colors.
{21348}{21418}I personally feel that I cannot leave.
{21420}{21478}Men are not asked to leave their ships|when they are in danger,
{21481}{21545}and women are not asked|to leave their children.
{21554}{21641}If Americans leave,|a great many of the Chinese would go, also.
{21648}{21754}{y:i}The hospital would have to close,|or be operated by military authorities.
{21795}{21897}One can't help feeling that leaving right now|would be passing up an opportunity
{21900}{21985}for service of the highest kind.
{22956}{23026}At 1:30 this afternoon,|I drove to Zhongshan Wharf.
{23078}{23147}{y:i}After a brief goodbye to the passengers,|I take the launch,
{23150}{23225}{y:i}which is honking impatiently now,|back to Shokwan.
{23265}{23312}My last bridge is burned.
{23511}{23590}{y:i}The city|is practically deserted now,
{23593}{23676}except for the poor,|who have no place to go.
{23848}{23943}This morning, after the service began,|the warning siren sounded.
{23953}{24016}{y:i}The pastor asked,|"Shall we continue, or go to a dugout?"
{24018}{24113}{y:i}One man said, "Continue." And we did so.
{24116}{24190}{y:i}Life is real. Life is earnest these days.
{24217}{24292}{y:i}Slowly, the heavy bombers drew near.
{24294}{24383}{y:i}When the bombing could be plainly heard|inside the city,
{24391}{24505}the pastor stopped preaching,|and asked us all to pray silently for peace.
{25042}{25121}The Chinese appear to regard Shanghai|as the main theater of war,
{25124}{25187}because Shanghai protects Nanking.
{25215}{25252}But for how long?
{25333}{25382}{y:i}Smoke-filled skies|signal to the world
{25385}{25456}{y:i}the final chapter|of the greatest war drama yet filmed.
{25530}{25573}{y:i}The actual fall of Shanghai!
{27223}{27277}{y:i}At 10:00 a.m.,|the order came.
{27295}{27345}"Regiment is to pursue enemy|towards Nanking."
{27366}{27418}"All troops have to be ready immediately."
{27599}{27657}{y:i}General Matsui said Nanking|is the capital of China,
{27659}{27737}{y:i}and our capturing of it|will be an international event.
{27739}{27854}{y:i}With General Matsui's principle in mind,|we began immediately to make our plans.
{27878}{27933}{y:i}From the Tokyo|Nichi-Nichi newspaper,
{27936}{27981}{y:i}reported on the road to Nanking.
{27983}{28021}"There are two|young commissioned officers
{28024}{28104}"who have undertaken a contest|to cut down a hundred with their swords.
{28125}{28242}{y:i}" It is said that one man has already killed|56 men and the other has killed 25.
{28245}{28304}{y:i}" When we reporters came upon|the two of them conferring,
{28306}{28373}{y:i}"second lieutenant Mukai said,|'With things going like this,
{28375}{28477}{y:i}"'I'll probably cut down 100 by the time|we reach Danyang, never mind Nanking.
{28479}{28541}"'You're going to lose.|My sword has killed 55,
{28543}{28576}"'and it's only got one little nick on it.'
{28598}{28637}{y:i}"Second lieutenant Noda responded,
{28639}{28737}{y:i}"'By the time you're in Danyang, I'll show|you what kind of a record I can rack up.'"
{28782}{28842}{y:i}Every time we seize a village|on the way to Nanking,
{28845}{28890}newly-commissioned officers|will test their swords
{28893}{28945}on the defeated Chinese soldiers.
{28947}{29008}When you behead someone,|you need to use a strong stroke,
{29010}{29097}so you raise the sword high,|and bring it down with force.
{29110}{29204}The head falls, and blood flies straight up|like a red pillar of fire.
{29219}{29315}There's an officer I know|who always bragged about killing people.
{29318}{29357}He would tie their wrists|and ankles with rope
{29360}{29454}so that the person to be beheaded|won't be able to stand or stretch his legs.
{29477}{29524}{y:i}Everyone copied his style.
{30014}{30060}Tonight's news, none too good.
{30097}{30175}Conditions look bad. Rumors and unrest.
{30202}{30289}{y:i}Word is, the Japanese are approaching|from three directions.
{30852}{30876}{y:i}Over and over again,
{30879}{30974}{y:i}I am struck by the similarity|of Jesus' day and today in China.
{30986}{31072}{y:i}Three other missionaries and I|spent an hour and a half today
{31074}{31165}{y:i}trying to see what Christians|can do in this present situation.
{31177}{31259}Are we to stand by hopelessly,|or is there something we can do?
{31262}{31305}And if so, what?
{31475}{31538}{y:i}Telegram we sent|to the Japanese Ambassador.
{31541}{31616}"An international committee|composed of nationals of Denmark,
{31620}{31671}"Germany, Great Britain,|and the United States
{31682}{31748}{y:i}"desires to suggest|to the Chinese and Japanese authorities
{31750}{31874}{y:i}"the establishment of a Safety Zone|for civilian refugees at or near Nanking.
{31882}{31937}"The committee would respectfully request|a prompt reply
{31939}{31993}"from the Japanese authorities|to this proposal."
{32004}{32058}We will bear tremendous responsibility
{32061}{32161}if we first order the remaining populace|of Nanking into the neutral zone
{32163}{32236}and then later are turned down|by the Japanese.
{32250}{32338}To our surprise, the big-hearted German|who we'd elected chairman
{32341}{32394}turned out to be|the National-Socialist leader here.
{32408}{32470}I continue to hope that Hitler will help us.
{32481}{32567}{y:i}He has deep sympathy,|not only for the distress of his own people,
{32570}{32620}{y:i}but for the anguish of the Chinese as well.
{32622}{32701}So now, it turns out that the burden of work|is to be carried out
{32703}{32814}{y:i}by a group of American missionaries|and a group of German Nazi businessmen.
{32846}{32916}{y:i}At 2:30,|as I walked down Shanghai Road,
{32918}{33042}again and again, I met groups of women|and children in search of the Safety Zone.
{33049}{33151}{y:i}I told them that it was not yet certain,|but when it was, they would be notified.
{33168}{33227}The Safety Zone is not yet assured.
{33259}{33321}{y:i}Telegram|to the United States Embassy.
{33324}{33401}"Japanese authorities|have duly noted request for a Safety Zone
{33403}{33448}"but regret cannot grant it."
{33455}{33562}According to radio reports, London regards|this reply as a flat-out refusal.
{33583}{33639}We're of a different opinion here.
{33642}{33715}Their answer is cleverly couched|in diplomatic terms,
{33718}{33763}leaving a back door open.
{34290}{34405}Mayor Ma virtually turned over to us|administrative responsibilities for the Zone,
{34408}{34473}along with a police force of 450 men,
{34475}{34594}{y:i}2,000 tons of rice, 10,000 bags of flour,|and some salt.
{34659}{34709}{y:i}Since Mayor Ma|left Nanking yesterday,
{34712}{34797}{y:i}and since the committee is forced to deal|with all the administrative problems
{34800}{34860}and workings inside our Safety Zone,
{34862}{34974}I've, in face of this, become something|very like an acting mayor.
{34977}{35029}Enough to give you a fit, Rabe.
{35070}{35145}{y:i}The Japanese are now nearing|the halfway mark from Shanghai
{35148}{35224}{y:i}and we have already heard|the rumble of big guns.
{35679}{35728}{y:i}Thousands of refugees are fleeing
{35730}{35802}{y:i}into our so-called Safety Zone|from all directions.
{35818}{35900}The sight of the poorest of the poor|wandering aimlessly in the streets
{35903}{35945}is enough to make you weep.
{35970}{36053}{y:i}As it grows dark, some families,|unable to find shelter anywhere,
{36056}{36138}{y:i}stretch out to sleep|in nooks and alcoves of buildings,
{36141}{36227}{y:i}or simply on the street, despite the cold.
{36258}{36325}We are working feverishly|to develop the Zone.
{37304}{37368}{y:i}Around us here,|we now have thousands of poor people
{37370}{37427}{y:i}crowded into all the available buildings.
{37430}{37497}What will happen to them|is mere conjecture.
{37522}{37572}{y:i}The Zone is all marked|with flags and banners,
{37574}{37643}{y:i}and so far,|the Japanese have not bombed it.
{37654}{37725}{y:i}We still have hopes|that even if they do not recognize it,
{37727}{37761}{y:i}they might respect it.
{37764}{37867}{y:i}If they do, it will mean the saving|of thousands of lives of poor people.
{38010}{38092}Five air raids on Monday|and one on Tuesday.
{38095}{38148}I'm writing this during our sixty-first.
{38170}{38216}{y:i}Tonight,|the flames are lighting the sky
{38218}{38272}{y:i}above the whole|southwest corner of the city.
{38293}{38354}And in the afternoon,|we had seen clouds of smoke
{38357}{38418}rising in every direction, save northwest.
{38506}{38622}{y:i}It is quite a sensation to be|the only surgeon in a big, war-torn city.
{38662}{38721}{y:i}How can we leave the sick patients?
{38814}{38913}The Japs have now reached a point|about 25 miles from the city.
{38916}{39012}Gunfire could be heard.|It won't be long now.
{39046}{39122}{y:i}The city gates|are to be closed tomorrow.
{39125}{39165}{y:i}I sent a telegram to Siemens today,
{39167}{39267}{y:i}asking them to pay up any|life insurance premiums that may be due.
{39295}{39396}If I were to say I was not afraid, I'd be lying.
{39440}{39501}{y:i}The swift Japanese|advance on the national capital
{39506}{39572}{y:i}make the vicinity of Nanking|a place of danger.
{39577}{39669}{y:i}The Nipponese invaders strike westward|with incredible speed.
{39671}{39785}{y:i}The defenders bravely ignore a Japanese|ultimatum calling on them to surrender.
{39942}{40007}{y:i}If you're getting the same sort|of radio reports that we are,
{40010}{40086}{y:i}you are undoubtedly alarmed|for our safety here.
{40113}{40172}We're a little concerned ourselves.
{40269}{40350}{y:i}Today's air raid brings our tally to 114.
{40462}{40500}The tally must come to a close,
{40503}{40591}as today was one long air raid,|from morning till night.
{40644}{40743}{y:i}I am writing this to the tune of big guns,|just outside of the city.
{40800}{40896}{y:i}Japanese advance guards|have reached the walls in several places.
{40975}{41037}Until about 1:00 p.m., December 10th,
{41039}{41104}General Asaka and I had been waiting|outside of Zhongshan Gate
{41106}{41193}{y:i}for the bearer of the flag of truce|from the Chinese army.
{41288}{41329}{y:i}However, he never came.
{41332}{41382}{y:i}For that reason, from about 2:00 p.m.,
{41385}{41452}{y:i}a general attack|was commenced against Nanking.
{41713}{41797}Shells from Japanese guns|commenced falling inside the city walls,
{41800}{41839}and I went outside to watch them.
{41842}{41877}They formed a perfect pattern,
{41880}{42005}{y:i}the explosions advancing in regular rows|about 25 yards every half-minute.
{42068}{42164}They were coming from outside|the South Gate, directly towards me.
{42256}{42332}Uninterrupted artillery fire|from Purple Mountain.
{42340}{42433}Thunder and lightning around the hill.|And suddenly, the whole hill is in flames.
{42591}{42637}{y:i}An old adage says,
{42650}{42740}"When Purple Mountain burns,|Nanking is lost."
{42992}{43026}{y:i}December 13th.
{43029}{43090}{y:i}I was in the middle of my service|when the telephone rang,
{43093}{43132}{y:i}and I answered it.
{43159}{43221}I was asked to immediately go to the|Zone committee's headquarters.
{43231}{43288}The Japanese had broken into the city.
{43331}{43368}{y:i}The wall had been breached,
{43371}{43431}{y:i}and the damage to the southern part|of the city was tremendous.
{43434}{43507}{y:i}No one will ever know|what the Chinese casualties were,
{43510}{43554}{y:i}but they must have been enormous.
{43557}{43604}Soldiers streamed|through the city from the south,
{43607}{43655}many of them passing through the Zone.
{50259}{50325}{y:i}In the morning,|the fresh-blood-colored flags
{50328}{50392}{y:i}of the Rising Sun were fluttering everywhere,
{50394}{50514}each proclaiming, with its red symbol,|the freshly spilled blood of Nanking.
{50630}{50670}{y:i}Three dangers are past:
{50673}{50761}{y:i}that of looting soldiers,|bombing from airplanes,
{50764}{50849}{y:i}and shelling from big guns.|But the fourth is still before us:
{50856}{50931}our fate at the hands of a victorious army.
{52302}{52410}{y:i}It's not until we tour the city|that we learn the extent of the destruction.
{52413}{52498}{y:i}We come across corpses|every 100 or 200 yards.
{52509}{52610}{y:i}The bodies of civilians that I examined|had bullet holes in their backs.
{52613}{52720}These people had presumably been fleeing,|and were shot from behind.
{54974}{55041}From 8:30 this morning|until 6:00 this evening,
{55043}{55150}{y:i}I stood at the front gate of Ginling College,|as the refugees poured in.
{55153}{55231}{y:i}They'd disguised themselves|in every possible way.
{55241}{55336}Many had cut their hair,|most of them had blackened their faces.
{55354}{55466}Many were wearing men or boys' clothing,|or even that of old women.
{55891}{55957}{y:i}Nanking has no lights, no water,|no telephone,
{55959}{56030}{y:i}no telegraph, no city paper, no radio!
{56060}{56167}We are indeed separated from all of you|by an impenetrable zone.
{56191}{56278}{y:i}The Japanese march through the city|in groups of 10 to 20 soldiers
{56281}{56321}{y:i}and loot the shops.
{56324}{56416}{y:i}They smash open windows and doors,|and take whatever they like.
{56418}{56471}We ran across a group|of 200 Chinese workers
{56473}{56565}whom Japanese soldiers have picked up|off the streets of the Safety Zone,
{56568}{56669}{y:i}and after having been tied up|are now being driven out of the city.
{56709}{56769}{y:i}At the last moment,|thousands of Chinese soldiers
{56772}{56822}{y:i}threw away their uniforms and equipment,
{56825}{56893}looted civilian clothes,|and crowded into the Zone.
{56925}{57001}{y:i}I had made up my mind|to bury the Chinese soldiers' clothes.
{57005}{57080}They had been thrown|onto the campus by the fleeing soldiers.
{57082}{57175}But when I got to the carpenter's shop|I could see that the gardeners were wiser.
{57177}{57256}They had burned them,|and thrown the grenades into a pond.
{57315}{57360}{y:i}At headquarters,|we found a mob of men
{57362}{57410}{y:i}outside that had been disarmed.
{57421}{57465}About 1,300 in all.
{57505}{57575}{y:i}We argued the Japanese|would not shoot disarmed men.
{57577}{57653}{y:i}So we went to our staff conference|quite relieved.
{57664}{57735}{y:i}We knew that there were a number|of ex-soldiers among them.
{57738}{57781}But Rabe had been promised by an officer
{57784}{57844}that very afternoon|that their lives would be spared.
{57852}{57900}But in a half-hour, we were called back.
{57906}{57961}{y:i}The Japanese had come back for them.
{57963}{58054}{y:i}The men were lined up|and roped together in groups of about 100
{58057}{58125}{y:i}by Japanese soldiers with bayonets fixed.
{58392}{58484}I tried for hours to prevent the Japanese|from marching these men out for execution.
{58520}{58553}But I failed.
{58657}{58762}By the light of our headlights,|we watched them march away to their doom.
{58794}{58869}Not a whimper came from the entire throng.
{58897}{58945}Our own hearts were lead.
{58998}{59038}{y:i}MILLS McCALLUM: During this time,|we really felt
{59041}{59107}{y:i}that we were contending|with the powers of evil.
{59128}{59201}This memory will remain with me forever.
{59240}{59308}We could do nothing to avert this tragedy.
{59365}{59446}{y:i}Japanese 6th Brigade Operation Order 138.
{59449}{59523}{y:i}" Since the defeated enemy soldiers|are believed to be in plain clothes,
{59525}{59612}{y:i}"you must arrest any person|who is suspected of being so.
{59614}{59713}"Regard every adult man up to middle age|as a plain-clothes soldier."
{59728}{59800}There is no system.|Soldiers seize anyone they suspect.
{59802}{59869}{y:i}Calluses on hands|are proof the man is a soldier.
{59871}{59973}{y:i}Rickshaw coolies, carpenters,|and other laborers are frequently taken.
{61259}{61341}I took moving pictures of a group|of about 70 or so Chinese men
{61343}{61372}being gathered on the road.
{61379}{61459}And in the picture, the women are kneeling|before the Japanese,
{61461}{61505}{y:i}begging for their menfolk.
{65131}{65226}How many thousands|were mown down by guns? Or bayoneted?
{65229}{65280}We shall probably never know.
{65282}{65350}But in many cases,|oil was thrown over the bodies,
{65353}{65398}and they were burned.
{65401}{65493}Charred bones tell the story|of many of those tragedies.
{68797}{68892}Some Japanese soldiers|were fierce and unreasonable.
{68895}{68996}And many of them|had their bayonets ready for use.
{68998}{69096}And on not a few of them,|I saw fresh bloodstains.
{70024}{70108}There seems to be no stop|to the ferocity of the brutes.
{70131}{70237}{y:i}At first I tried to be pleasant to them,|to avoid arousing their ire.
{70240}{70297}{y:i}But the smile has gradually worn off,
{70299}{70393}and my stare|is fully as cool and fishy as theirs.
{71108}{71187}A colonel and his staff called at my office,|and spent an hour trying to discover
{71189}{71271}where all the additional|disarmed soldiers were.
{71274}{71323}They insisted that they were hiding|within the Zone,
{71325}{71375}and that we were responsible|for concealing them.
{72698}{72772}Miss Vautrin ran to us,|and begged us to claim someone.
{72788}{72860}She told us if we claimed a man,|we would save a life.
{72878}{72919}As long as you had a relative,
{72930}{73003}the Japanese would assume|you were not a soldier.
{73009}{73100}There were two or three thousand|young men, some soldiers, some not.
{73102}{73149}We each claimed someone.
{73151}{73244}All day, I watched her running back|and forth across Ginling in this work.
{73327}{73411}Sometimes, one gets weary of spirit.
{73427}{73464}There is so much suffering.
{73466}{73549}{y:i}So many in such difficult|and impossible circumstances,
{73552}{73596}{y:i}it makes one hopeless.
{73613}{73656}{y:i}And when will it end?
{73716}{73763}{y:i}I can see little indication of God
{73765}{73818}in the tremendous wave of cruelty and greed
{73821}{73890}{y:i}that has engulfed a big piece of our world.
{73931}{73997}{y:i}I wish Emperor Hirohito|could see the mangled bodies
{74000}{74047}{y:i}of these simple, Chinese common people,
{74049}{74120}{y:i}which his spokesmen|profess to love so much.
{74141}{74205}{y:i}Or that I could carry some of the men|and women with legs blown off
{74208}{74263}{y:i}into the elegant parlors|of the rich Americans
{74265}{74337}who fatten on selling war supplies to Japan.
{74339}{74391}{y:i}They would probably worry more|about their rugs
{74393}{74440}{y:i}than about the wounded.
{74521}{74554}{y:i}Religious faith is believing
{74557}{74637}{y:i}that good things are worth doing|for their own sake.
{74670}{74743}{y:i}Even in a world|that seems overpoweringly evil.
{74825}{74867}{y:i}I remain assured in hard experience
{74869}{74920}{y:i}that neither by national guns|nor by national gods
{74922}{74966}{y:i}will mankind be saved,
{75004}{75102}{y:i}but only by the genuine regard|for all members of the human family.
{75208}{75309}{y:i}God, comfort the heartbroken|mothers and fathers of innocent sons
{75311}{75353}{y:i}who were shot today.
{75393}{75517}And guard the young women and girls|through the agonizing hours of this night.
{75577}{75643}Speed the day when war shall be no more.
{75687}{75772}In Nanking, we had time on our hands|and nothing to do.
{75785}{75824}{y:i}So we raped girls.
{82402}{82449}{y:i}December 18th, Saturday.
{82460}{82515}All days seem alike now.
{82517}{82561}Went to gate at 7:30.
{82564}{82655}A stream of weary,|wild-eyed women were coming in.
{82657}{82716}They said|their night had been one of horror.
{82718}{82806}That again and again,|their homes were visited by soldiers.
{82834}{82909}Twelve-year-old girls,|60-year-old women. Raped.
{82948}{83066}If only the thoughtful people of Japan|knew the facts of these days of horror.
{83197}{83236}We had on the grounds of our college
{83239}{83322}more than 10,000|women and children refugees.
{83325}{83427}{y:i}Every night, the soldiers|would enter our grounds to get the girls,
{83429}{83534}and every night Miss Vautrin|would try to keep them from the girls.
{83572}{83640}{y:i}It seems in several homes|near West Flower Gate,
{83642}{83744}{y:i}the soldiers, failing to find young girls,|are using teenage boys.
{83809}{83862}Tonight, I asked George Fitch|how the day went,
{83865}{83905}and what progress they had made,
{83908}{83972}and his reply was,
{83974}{84052}"It was hell today.|The blackest day of my life."
{84097}{84153}Certainly it was the same for me.
{84187}{84284}Tonight, a truck passed|in which there were eight or ten girls.
{84287}{84365}{y:i}And as it passed,|they called, "Jo ming! Jo ming!"
{84389}{84430}"Save our lives!"
{84484}{84532}{y:i}Six Japanese|climb over my garden wall
{84534}{84596}{y:i}and attempt|to open my gates from the inside.
{84598}{84674}When I arrive and shine my flashlight|on the face of one of them,
{84677}{84722}he reaches for his pistol.
{84725}{84796}But his hand drops quickly enough|when I yell at him
{84799}{84873}and hold my swastika armband|under his nose.
{84876}{84981}Then, on my orders,|all six have to scramble back over the wall.
{84983}{85047}My gates will never be opened|to a riffraff like that!
{86523}{86624}Every day, we call at the Japanese Embassy,|and present our protests and appeals,
{86626}{86683}our reports of violence and crime.
{86685}{86772}"For the kind attention of Mr. Kiyoshi Fukui,
{86774}{86833}"Second Secretary, Japanese Embassy.
{86853}{86946}"Dear Sirs,|we are very sorry to trouble you again,
{86949}{87023}"but the sufferings and needs|of 200,000 civilians
{87025}{87083}"for whom we are trying to care|make it urgent
{87085}{87166}{y:i}" that we try to secure action|from your military authorities
{87169}{87253}"to stop present disorder|among Japanese soldiers
{87257}{87308}"wandering through the Safety Zone."
{87328}{87361}"Case number 15,
{87363}{87420}"Japanese soldiers entered a house|on Hankow Road,
{87422}{87488}"raped a young wife,|and took away three women.
{87490}{87553}"When two husbands ran,|the soldiers shot both of them."
{87556}{87616}"Case number 154,
{87618}{87740}"a girl, 13 years old, was raped|by three Japanese soldiers
{87743}{87792}"at Chen Chia Chai number 6."
{87795}{87828}"Case number 290,
{87830}{87923}"four soldiers raped a young girl,|a little over 10, by turns."
{87975}{88067}{y:i}Fukuda and Tanaka of|the Japanese Embassy had nothing to say,
{88069}{88139}{y:i}except Fukuda's remark|that the army is very mad,
{88141}{88188}{y:i}because they say|it is the first time in history
{88190}{88277}{y:i}that an army had to conquer a place|with neutral observers on hand.
{88280}{88368}Quite a false view,|but we felt it was not time to argue.
{88370}{88449}{y:i}We have come to understand the Japanese|much better than we did.
{88452}{88503}{y:i}A week before their entry,|I preached to our group,
{88505}{88609}{y:i}and I urged them to have faith in the|goodness and humanity of the Japanese.
{88612}{88694}{y:i}The Chinese are still laughing at us|for our innocence.
{88714}{88774}{y:i}And we better understand|Japanese propaganda.
{88777}{88805}{y:i}In the midst of great suffering,
{88808}{88872}{y:i}Japanese news squads|went around staging pictures
{88874}{88996}{y:i}of Japanese soldiers giving candy to a child|or an army doctor examining 20 children.
{89050}{89153}Some Japanese newsmen came to the camp|and handed out cakes and apples,
{89156}{89213}and a few coins to the refugees.
{89229}{89296}{y:i}A moving picture was taken of this kind act.
{89298}{89342}At the same time, a bunch of soldiers
{89345}{89442}climbed the back wall of the compound|and raped a dozen or so women.
{89445}{89500}{y:i}No pictures were taken out back.
{89759}{89805}{y:i}We are introduced|to Commandant Matsui,
{89808}{89858}{y:i}who shakes hands all around.
{89861}{89900}{y:i}I assume the role of spokesman
{89902}{89970}and explain to Mr. Tanaka|of the Japanese Embassy
{89973}{90046}that we infer|that the city is to be burned down.
{90067}{90132}Tanaka denies this with a smile.
{90134}{90233}Statement by the Japanese military|posted throughout the city.
{90236}{90308}{y:i}" The municipality of Nanking is quiet.
{90310}{90360}{y:i}" The herds of refugees|who fled for their lives
{90362}{90461}{y:i}" from the midst of death have met with|the gentle soothing of the Japanese army.
{90464}{90504}{y:i}" The Imperial army entered the city,
{90506}{90589}{y:i}"put their bayonets into sheaths,|and stretched forth merciful hands
{90592}{90644}{y:i}" in order to examine and to heal,
{90647}{90744}{y:i}" diffusing grace and favor|to the excellent, true citizens.
{90747}{90781}{y:i}" Many thousands of refugees
{90783}{90872}{y:i}" cast off their former absurd attitudes|of opposing Japan,
{90874}{90985}{y:i}" and clasped their hands in congratulation|for receiving assurance of life.
{90989}{91059}{y:i}" Looking down, one sees a playground|for Nanking children,
{91061}{91160}{y:i}" with soldiers and Chinese children|playing joyfully on all sides."
{91193}{91267}{y:i}The proclamation on the handbills|which airplanes scattered over the city,
{91269}{91337}{y:i}saying the Japanese|are the only real friends of the Chinese
{91339}{91389}{y:i}and would protect the good, of course
{91392}{91456}{y:i}meant no more|than most of their statements.
{91459}{91578}And to show their sincerity,|they raped, looted, and killed at will.
{91585}{91683}In these hard times,|it is certainly a life-saver to be in a gang.
{91711}{91777}{y:i}The thing about the whole situation|that startles us all
{91780}{91820}{y:i}is how we, unarmed handful of foreigners,
{91823}{91898}{y:i}can chase the Japanese soldiers|out of rooms in school buildings,
{91901}{91981}{y:i}rooms in foreign houses,|and rooms in Chinese homes.
{91983}{92038}{y:i}And still, no one gets hurt.
{92041}{92104}{y:i}The soldiers often actually run away.
{92107}{92149}{y:i}Part of it is pure bluff.
{92152}{92222}If we batted an eye, we'd be done for.
{92248}{92289}Our group here at the house|drafted a message
{92292}{92344}to the American Consulate General|in Shanghai,
{92347}{92416}asking that diplomatic representatives|be sent here immediately,
{92418}{92455}as the situation was urgent,
{92457}{92533}then asked the Japanese|to send it via Navy radio.
{92536}{92612}Needless to say, it was never sent.
{92615}{92704}{y:i}When things were at their worst,|the fellows at our house remarked at supper,
{92706}{92734}{y:i}" The first fellow that gets killed,
{92737}{92831}{y:i}" we're going to carry his body over|and put it in the Japanese Embassy."
{92833}{92920}{y:i}Each night, the eight of us wonder|who would be missing the next night.
{92922}{93000}We said,|"We just can't all get through this alive."
{93020}{93112}At noon, a man was led to headquarters|with head burned cinder-black,
{93114}{93176}eyes and ears gone, nose partly gone...
{93194}{93244}{y:i}A ghastly sight.
{93246}{93357}I took him to the hospital in my car,|where he died a few hours later.
{93360}{93415}His story was|that he was one of the gang of some 100,
{93417}{93453}who had been tied together,
{93455}{93526}then gasoline thrown over them,|and set afire.
{93632}{93725}December 24th, the day before Christmas.
{93727}{93835}About 10:00, I was called to my office|by a high military advisor.
{93851}{93958}Miss Minnie Vautrin, our American Minnie,|a proper lady to the core...
{93979}{94090}{y:i}She believes in her girls and guards them|the way a hen guards her chicks.
{94093}{94123}{y:i}I shall never forget her
{94125}{94199}{y:i}marching at the head of some|400 female refugees through the town,
{94201}{94281}{y:i}right past groups of vagabonding|Japanese soldiers,
{94284}{94384}to guide the refugees to the safety|of her girls' camp in Ginling College.
{94413}{94473}And now, something terrible|has happened to our Minnie.
{94475}{94516}The request was
{94518}{94628}that they be allowed to pick out|prostitute women from our 10,000 refugees.
{94630}{94687}They said they wanted 100.
{94689}{94768}They feel that if they can start a regular,|licensed place for the soldiers,
{94770}{94848}then they will not molest innocent|or decent women.
{94862}{94936}And, with hands clenched in horror,|Minnie is forced to watch
{94938}{95046}as authorized underlings force their way|into her girls' assembly hall,
{95049}{95108}filled with hundreds of good girls.
{95124}{95192}{y:i}She's not going to hand over|even one of them willingly.
{95194}{95290}But then, a number of young refugee girls|step forward.
{95313}{95365}Evidently, former prostitutes.
{95394}{95436}Minnie is speechless.
{95451}{95504}They finally secured 21.
{95507}{95576}But group after group of women|have asked me
{95578}{95678}if they will select the other 79|from the decent women and girls.
{95709}{95752}And all I can answer is,
{95754}{95841}"They will not do so|if it is in my power to prevent it."
{95915}{95997}{y:i}Bob Wilson helped out|at our house last night.
{95999}{96068}{y:i}He got home early|for the first time in two weeks.
{96070}{96123}{y:i}So he went to the university gardens,
{96125}{96222}brought six big poinsettias,|and put them around our living room.
{96225}{96262}So we look like Christmas, anyway.
{96294}{96363}{y:i}Everyone is competing to make this|a happy Christmas for me.
{96365}{96410}It's really touching.
{96413}{96507}Chang brought some Christmas roses|and has decorated the house with them.
{96509}{96587}He even managed to find a little fir tree|that he wants to decorate.
{96589}{96637}And he just came in grinning with joy
{96639}{96723}and carrying six very long candles|that he rounded up somewhere.
{96745}{96790}Everybody likes me, suddenly.
{96793}{96845}And it used to be, or so I thought,
{96848}{96920}that no one wanted|to have much to do with me.
{96933}{96989}Or might I have been wrong there?
{97009}{97082}How strange, my dear Dora,|my dear children and grandchildren.
{97085}{97148}I know you're all praying for me today.
{97181}{97256}{y:i}I feel as if I'm surrounded|by loving thoughts.
{97294}{97326}{y:i}Believe me,
{97329}{97409}I have a prayer in my heart|for all of you, as well.
{97423}{97489}{y:i}It seems like anything|but Christmas Eve.
{97505}{97580}{y:i}It is sort of tough to keep|Japanese soldiers from looting a hospital
{97582}{97668}{y:i}in the center of what was,|a few weeks ago, a great city,
{97689}{97782}{y:i}while the rest of the family|is scattered all over the globe.
{97785}{97846}{y:i}My baby will be six months old in four days,
{97849}{97933}{y:i}and I have only seen her|for seven weeks of that time.
{97936}{97984}{y:i}It would be pleasant to close the year
{97986}{98041}{y:i}with some sort of|brighter outlook for the next,
{98043}{98121}{y:i}but we seem to be closing|on a note of deepest gloom,
{98124}{98181}{y:i}without a glimmer of light ahead.
{98198}{98271}{y:i}The only consolation is that|it can't be worse.
{98285}{98380}They can't kill as many people,|as there aren't any more to kill.
{98553}{98613}Christmas Eve, Nanking, China, 1937.
{98645}{98725}What I am about to relate|is a story which I feel must be told,
{98728}{98786}even if it is seen by only a few.
{98820}{98856}{y:i}In these two short weeks,
{98858}{98918}{y:i}we here in Nanking|have been through a siege.
{98921}{99019}{y:i}The Chinese army has left, defeated,|and the Japanese have come in.
{99036}{99093}On that day, Nanking was still
{99096}{99205}{y:i}the beautiful city we were so proud of,|with law and order still prevailing.
{99221}{99345}{y:i}Today, it is a city laid waste, ravaged,|completely looted, much of it burned.
{99372}{99438}{y:i}Complete anarchy has reigned for 10 days.
{99461}{99512}{y:i}It has been a hell on earth.
{99570}{99648}Not that my life has been|in serious danger at any time,
{99650}{99709}though turning lust-mad, drunken soldiers|out of houses
{99711}{99817}where they were raping the women|is not altogether a safe occupation.
{99819}{99865}Nor does one feel|perhaps too sure of himself
{99868}{99964}when he finds a bayonet at his chest|or a revolver at his head,
{99985}{100092}and knows it is handled by someone|who heartily wishes him out of the way.
{100105}{100204}{y:i}The Japanese army is anything but pleased|at our being here.
{100206}{100253}{y:i}They wanted no observers.
{100272}{100322}But to have to stand by,
{100325}{100407}while even the very poor are having|their last possessions taken from them,
{100409}{100469}their last coin, their last bit of bedding,
{100471}{100571}{y:i}while thousands of disarmed soldiers|who had sought sanctuary within,
{100573}{100633}{y:i}together with many hundreds|of innocent civilians,
{100636}{100739}{y:i}are taken out before your eyes to be shot|or used for bayonet practice.
{100757}{100859}{y:i}And we have to listen to the sounds|of the guns that are killing them.
{100886}{100977}Over a thousand women kneel before you,|crying hysterically,
{100979}{101085}begging you to save them|from the beasts who are preying on them.
{101088}{101176}To stand by and do nothing,|while your flag is taken down and insulted?
{101179}{101224}Not once, but a dozen times.
{101226}{101285}And your own house is being looted?
{101309}{101373}{y:i}And then to watch|the city you have come to love
{101395}{101456}{y:i}and the institutions|to which you'd planned to devote your best
{101459}{101547}{y:i}deliberately and systematically|burned by fire?
{101597}{101667}This is a hell I had never before envisaged.
{101706}{101767}And we keep asking ourselves,|"How long can this last?"
{101769}{101853}Day by day, we are assured by the officials|that things will be better soon,
{101856}{101905}that "we will do our best."
{101944}{102001}But each day|has been worse than the day before.
{102242}{102316}January 1st, a new year filled with hope.
{102599}{102663}There was a worship ceremony|at 8:30 this morning.
{102665}{102780}In the solemn air, the trumpets sounded,|and the Japanese flag was raised.
{102782}{102887}{y:i}It is moving beyond words,|with the swords sparkling in the rising sun.
{102933}{102965}{y:i}We saluted the military flag,
{102968}{103040}{y:i}gave three cheers|for our Emperor and Empress.
{103064}{103157}January 4. It is just three weeks|since Nanking was taken,
{103159}{103256}and, as yet, there has been no foreigner|allowed in or out.
{103258}{103352}The Japanese try to cover things up|wherever it's even vaguely feasible.
{103354}{103407}And the ban on anyone entering or leaving
{103409}{103514}{y:i}is one of their ways of keeping the world|ignorant of Nanking's present state.
{103542}{103576}We have now received news
{103578}{103675}that the Japanese want to close|all refugee camps on February 4th.
{103701}{103781}{y:i}The refugees are supposed to return|to the devastated city.
{103783}{103860}{y:i}And it doesn't matter|where they live amid the ruins.
{103863}{103961}{y:i}This could be awful, but we don't know|how to avert this calamity.
{103964}{104022}The military has all the power.
{104064}{104199}At 3:00 p.m., two embassy police came|and asked us to get all the refugees together
{104201}{104300}so they could explain to them|the plan of returning to their homes.
{104313}{104425}A Chinese man was with them who|used to be a low-level Chinese army officer.
{104428}{104519}In order not to be killed,|he became a Japanese collaborator.
{104540}{104657}When he was alone with Miss Vautrin,|he told her not to let the young girls go.
{104674}{104717}He wept as he spoke.
{104727}{104813}Their real object|is to get these people away from us,
{104816}{104886}who have been their protection|during these terrible weeks.
{104897}{104940}If they do not go back,
{104942}{105015}the refugees in camps|will be driven out by soldiers.
{105017}{105077}{y:i}Some of the refugees|have registered and gone home,
{105080}{105127}{y:i}hoping to live there peacefully.
{105129}{105195}{y:i}But, unexpectedly,|when the refugees arrived home,
{105197}{105278}Japanese soldiers were seen,|hunting for women.
{105284}{105350}{y:i}I shall never bring pressure|on women to leave again.
{105353}{105419}My experience on that was too bitter.
{105421}{105539}One woman of 27, whom we urged|to go back to her husband,
{105541}{105636}was raped by three soldiers|within three hours after she left us.
{105652}{105694}I learned my lesson,
{105721}{105777}and shall not easily forget it.
{105810}{105860}We have the possibility of a massacre.
{105862}{105930}But I don't see myself staying out of sight|while soldiers use bayonets
{105933}{105980}on women and children who trusted us.
{105982}{106038}I scolded two Japanese soldiers.
{106053}{106156}The fellow in front was taking it all right,|but the one in back was a surly fellow.
{106159}{106244}He drew his bayonet,|and then he made a pass at my middle.
{106246}{106293}I stood my ground.
{106296}{106341}But since his first pass was unsuccessful,
{106343}{106423}he took his bayonet|and held it to my neck for a moment.
{106425}{106523}He muttered something in Japanese,|and jerked his bayonet forward.
{106525}{106598}When I ducked my head back, it drew blood.
{106641}{106729}{y:i}I fear that the military|intends to clear the Zone by force.
{106769}{106852}The middle paths are the only open spot|left in the garden.
{106855}{106908}As they come outside,|they all fall to their knees,
{106910}{106978}and cannot be persuaded to get up|from the cold cement path
{106981}{107038}until I give the following speech.
{107071}{107118}"The Japanese have publicly announced
{107121}{107209}"that you must leave the refugee camps|in the Zone today.
{107234}{107348}"I personally shall not chase you away,|but what can I, a single foreigner, do?
{107364}{107447}"Nonetheless, I'll try|to prevent the Japanese from entering."
{107730}{107832}When I return home in my car today,|I am received with a royal salute.
{107835}{107906}My poor refugees|have formed two long lines.
{107909}{108022}Then all my 600 parishioners surround me|and give me a greeting written on a banner.
{108025}{108136}They all bow three times, and are very happy|when I bow my head in gratitude.
{108158}{108220}Then one of my Chinese friends|translates the greeting.
{108223}{108331}You are the living Buddha|for 100,000 people.
{108333}{108431}You have saved thousands of people|from danger and want.
{108433}{108564}May the favor of heaven be granted to you.|May God's blessing rest upon you.
{108711}{108779}{y:i}As is obvious from the letters|that arrived for me yesterday
{108781}{108832}{y:i}from Shanghai via the German Embassy,
{108834}{108926}people there have not the vaguest notion|of current conditions here.
{108929}{108975}And what do we do next?
{108977}{109031}We've about shot our bolts.
{109121}{109205}{y:i}At 6:40, I took the Japanese military|train to Shanghai.
{109228}{109318}{y:i}I was crowded in with about as unsavory|a crowd of soldiers as one could imagine
{109321}{109351}{y:i}in a third-class coach.
{109353}{109449}Nervous, because sewed into the lining|of my camel's hair greatcoat
{109452}{109542}were eight reels of 16 mm movie film|of atrocity cases,
{109545}{109636}most of which were taken|at the university hospital by John Magee.
{109638}{109728}They were so terrible|that they had to be seen to be believed.
{109730}{109808}My baggage would undoubtedly|be carefully examined by the military
{109810}{109868}when we got to Shanghai.
{109870}{109932}What might happen,|if they discovered these films?
{112132}{112160}The pictures shown herewith
{112162}{112225}give but a fragmentary glimpse|of the unspeakable things that happened
{112228}{112328}following the Japanese occupation|of Nanking on December 13, 1937.
{112360}{112423}{y:i}One must remember|that of the thousands injured,
{112425}{112525}{y:i}only a small percentage got to the hospital|or were even heard of.
{112573}{112641}{y:i}These pictures have been taken|with no thought
{112643}{112707}{y:i}of stirring up a spirit of hatred|against the Japanese,
{112709}{112842}{y:i}but only with the desire to make|all people realize how horrible war is.
{112890}{112973}Great care had to be exercised|not to be seen while taking pictures.
{112975}{113066}Otherwise, the camera|would have been smashed or confiscated.
{113103}{113170}Fortunately, the reels weren't discovered.
{113201}{113229}{y:i}Washington.
{113232}{113304}I was the guest of Undersecretary of State,|Dr. Stanley Hornbeck,
{113307}{113339}whom I had known in China,
{113341}{113408}and I was given the opportunity|to see many people of importance.
{113410}{113470}And I also showed my films|to newspapermen
{113473}{113525}and the Foreign Affairs Committee|of the House.
{113528}{113593}In Los Angeles,|a couple of speeches were lined up for me,
{113596}{113671}{y:i}and one, where I showed my films,|caused something of a sensation,
{113673}{113726}{y:i}even illness|on the part of a couple of the audience.
{113745}{113826}And, following the meeting,|a Japanese gentleman approached me
{113829}{113921}and said that my statements about|the atrocities in Nanking were not true.
{113924}{114062}They could not be true,|for Japanese were incapable of such acts.
{114065}{114132}He asked me to retract|some of the things I had said,
{114134}{114217}and intimated that it would be best for me|if I did so.
{114241}{114301}I told him that I had many Japanese friends
{114304}{114390}and knew that most Japanese were|incapable of such acts as I had described.
{114393}{114544}But, I said, unfortunately,|everything I said was true,
{114546}{114605}and hence, I could retract nothing.
{115038}{115120}The war has rolled on|to engulf a thousand other towns like ours.
{115122}{115236}This story of invasion, massacre,|rape and oppression
{115239}{115319}will be reenacted among countless|communities in China.
{115349}{115438}{y:i}Nanking looks like a garden|that's been devoured by locusts.
{115453}{115525}The enemy creates a desert|and calls it peace.
{115640}{115675}At the conclusion of World War II,
{115677}{115764}the Allies convened|a War Crimes Tribunal in Tokyo.
{115767}{115807}{y:i}From the summary judgment,
{115809}{115883}{y:i}approximately 20,000 cases of rape|occurred in Nanking
{115885}{115955}{y:i}within the first month of the occupation.
{115957}{116040}{y:i}Estimates indicate that the total number|of civilians and prisoners of war
{116043}{116087}{y:i}murdered in Nanking and its vicinity
{116089}{116156}{y:i}during the first six weeks|of the Japanese occupation
{116158}{116200}{y:i}was over 200,000.
{117299}{117357}{y:i}Do I hate the Japanese? No.
{117397}{117481}{y:i}I dislike very much their policy,|and I dislike very much
{117484}{117546}{y:i}the way they are treating|the common people of China.
{117549}{117631}{y:i}But if I am ever given the opportunity|of doing the same for the Japanese
{117634}{117705}{y:i}as we have done here for the Chinese men,|women and children,
{117708}{117768}I would do the same right over again.
{118373}{118480}{y:i}I have deeply loved and respected|the cause of missions and Ginling College.
{118492}{118616}Had I 10 lives, I would dedicate them all|to this cause of kingdom-building.
{118674}{118745}But alas, I have failed.
{119196}{119225}{y:i}Dearest,
{119243}{119305}{y:i}don't think for a moment|that I wouldn't give my right eye
{119308}{119387}{y:i}to be with you|and our unbelievably adorable child.
{119409}{119501}We have been caught up in a cataclysm,|and during the immediate crisis,
{119504}{119570}until some light|gets thrown upon future events,
{119573}{119635}it is absolutely essential to sit tight.
{120154}{120216}{y:i}I do not regret having stayed on here.
{120239}{120305}For my presence has saved many lives.
{120331}{120419}But all the same,|my suffering is indescribable.
{122505}{122606}{y:i}The Chinese have an unsurpassed|capacity for suffering and endurance,
{122621}{122677}in addition to their many other qualities,
{122681}{122744}and right must triumph in the end.
{122775}{122853}I shall always be glad|I threw in my lot with them.
