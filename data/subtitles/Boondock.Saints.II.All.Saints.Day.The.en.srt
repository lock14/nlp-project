if you popped it in there,

because it makes me
feel special.

00:13:46,366 --> 00:13:48,159
Of course, I was hoping
we could be a bit
more personable.

you to call me Eunice,

a "fuck" situation, is it?

208
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:03,258
I mean, I can understand
a "goddamn" or two,

209
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:05,844
but why skip
all the way to fuck,
right off the bat?

210

Let's just start slow
and work our way up to it.

211
00:14:08,722 --> 00:14:12,392
What is the Fed's
interest in this?

212
00:14:13,937 --> 00:14:18,690
Their interest, Detective,
is capturing
the men responsible

213
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:22,027
for the murders
of 22 of Boston's
finest criminals.

214
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:25,572
You see,
public perception is that
these boys stepped in,

215
00:14:25,657 --> 00:14:26,865
did our jobs for us,

216
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:28,908
and then disappeared
into thin air

217
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,036
as we fecklessly
searched for them.

218
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,496
Now, the FBI
tends to take offense
to such things.

219
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:36,832
They could have sent anyone.
They sent me.
Now, why do you think that is?

220
00:14:36,918 --> 00:14:40,796
Well, since we've broken
the "fuck" barrier,
allow me to be blunt.

221
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:43,923
It is because
I am so fucking smart

222
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:47,469
that I make smart people
feel like they are retarded.

223
00:14:48,388 --> 00:14:49,388
Now.

224
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:52,307

on the wrong foot, here.

a bit of cooperation.

to paying respect
to the memory

mutual friend,

228
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:04,945

everything I know.

229
00:15:08,115 --> 00:15:09,115
Lovely.

230
00:15:09,741 --> 00:15:11,951
Now, what's with the circus?

231
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,912
The victim was killed
late last night.

232
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,538
When people gathered
for morning mass,

233
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:18,125
they found
the front entrance
chained and padlocked.

234
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,001
Locksmith comes out,
cuts the chain and...

235

are devout.

275

put Yuri Petrova on his knees

299
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:43,848
and each dropped iron
to the back of his head.

forth from Thy hand.

301

Eyes front, David.

302
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:56,736
The position of the victim
and the angles produced
by the killers' stance

303
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,738
created a unique scenario.

304
00:19:58,865 --> 00:20:01,615
The bullets
crisscrossed in the skull
and exited the eyes.

305
00:20:01,741 --> 00:20:05,912

The rounds moved on
a straight trajectory

00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,290
through the back
of the victim's head
and out the front,

00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:11,542

he was left-handed.

Now the victim falls forward.
If you please, David.

314

the body from the left and
flipped him to the right.

to be 5'11 " tall.

Petrova's eyeballs.

319
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,846
Here, they came out
the lower cheek,

320
00:21:04,931 --> 00:21:07,265
three, four inches
below the eyes.

321
00:21:07,391 --> 00:21:12,519
That puts him at 5'7"-ish.
That's not uncommonly short.

322
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:16,066
The killer posed as
a late-night confessor.

323
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:19,611
Once the victim
entered the booth,
the killer had him isolated.

324
00:21:19,694 --> 00:21:20,903
No escape.

00:21:25,034 --> 00:21:27,410
leaving a crescent-shaped
indentation,

328
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,119
which tells us
that this cowboy

329
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,288
was wearing a boot
with a pronounced heel.

00:21:31,414 --> 00:21:33,290

possible involvement

are fitting to do some
killing here tonight.

1526
01:32:29,711 --> 01:32:32,378
I'm talking bullets, blood,
custom wholesale slaughter.

1527
01:32:32,463 --> 01:32:33,838
You follow me, Lloyd-o?

1528

(WHIMPERS)

1529
01:32:34,966 --> 01:32:37,967
Good. Now,
I've run into a little snag.

1530
01:32:38,052 --> 01:32:41,805
You see, I'm trying to
figure out a tag line.

1531
01:32:41,890 --> 01:32:43,474
You know,
something cool to say
when it's all over,

1532
01:32:43,557 --> 01:32:46,976
like, "We're gonna
need a bigger boat."

1533
01:32:47,103 --> 01:32:49,104
Or, "I'll be back."

1534
01:32:49,189 --> 01:32:50,730
But mine, you know?
I've gotta own this thing.

1535
01:32:51,483 --> 01:32:54,318
Let's explain
the glass now.

1536
01:32:54,653 --> 01:32:57,654
Why is most of it
inside the room?

1537
01:32:58,280 --> 01:33:01,408
Well, here's why,
or at least it will be
why in a moment.

1538
01:33:01,493 --> 01:33:07,163
You see, these boys,
they tend to get real...

1539

It happened to be
a creative plan!

1540
01:33:10,918 --> 01:33:11,918
Fucking ridiculous!

1541
01:33:12,002 --> 01:33:14,587
Probably based
on some stupid shit
you saw in a movie!

1542
01:33:14,672 --> 01:33:18,216
And here I am again, all tying
myself up with fucking rope!

1543
01:33:18,301 --> 01:33:20,051
What's the deal with you
and the fucking rope?
Honestly!

1544
01:33:20,136 --> 01:33:23,055
It happened to be
a very useful thing,
so shut it!

1545
01:33:23,139 --> 01:33:26,100
You didn't get this
from a movie, did you?

1546

The Eiger Sanction
with Clint Eastwood.
Fuck!

1547
01:33:30,020 --> 01:33:32,273
And it worked
like a charm for him,
so shut it!

1548

Oh, God.

1549
01:33:33,440 --> 01:33:34,858

Fuck this!
No!

1553
01:33:46,578 --> 01:33:48,538
Why? What do you
think's going to happen?

1554
01:33:48,622 --> 01:33:51,875
I don't know.
Don't want to know.

1555
01:33:55,005 --> 01:33:56,963
Now I'm gonna
take the gag off,

1556
01:33:57,047 --> 01:33:59,132

so it doesn't hurt.

I'm a janitor.

1565
01:34:15,483 --> 01:34:17,359
What do I know
about guns and bullets
and shit, man?

1566
01:34:17,444 --> 01:34:18,444
Well, then, just...

1567
01:34:18,528 --> 01:34:19,528
No! I don't care
what you're doing here

1568

It's none of my business.

1569

I have a wife and
a family and kids.

even my kids, right?

did you do?
