anoXmous

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:29,202
anoXmous

3
00:00:02,839 --> 00:00:04,910
( Music playing )

4
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,792
Children:
Black cats and goblins

5
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,633
and broomsticks and ghosts.

6
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,712
Covens of witches
with all of their hosts.

7
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:16,790
You may think they scare me,

8
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,598
you're probably right.

9
00:02:18,759 --> 00:02:21,513
Black cats and goblins
on Halloween night.

10
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,478
Trick or treat!

11
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,629
( Owl hooting )

12
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:46,230
Girl: My parents
won't be home until 10:00.

13
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,198
Boy: Are you sure?

14
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:59,472
We are alone, aren't we?

15
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:01,711
Michael's around someplace.

16
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,234
( Qiggles )

17
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,437
Take off that thing.

18
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,518
- Let's go upstairs.
- Okay.

19
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,871
( Qiggles )

20
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,435
( clock ticking )

21
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,355
Boy: Look, Judith,
it's really late. I got to go.

22
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,511
Judith: Call me tomorrow?

23
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,113
Yeah, sure.

24
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:40,475
- Promise?
- Yeah.

25
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:03,516
(clock chiming )

26
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,153
(Judith humming)

27
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:48,988
Michael!

28
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,112
- ( Screaming )
- ( Stabbing )

29
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,836
Michael!

30
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,038
( Breathing heavily )

31
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,389
Michael?

32
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,516
( Thunder crashing )

33
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,670
( rain pattering )

34
00:07:35,519 --> 00:07:38,194
( thunder crashes )

35
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:47,389
You ever done anything
like this before?

36
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,598
Only minimum security.

37
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,716
I see.

38
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,915
Man: Their driveway's
200 yards up on the right.

39
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,509
( Thunder crashes )

40
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:02,559
Nurse: The only thing that ever
bothers me is their gibberish.

41
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,076
When they start raving
on and on.

42
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,709
You haven't anything
to worry about.

43
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,800
He hasn't spoken a word
in 15 years.

44
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:15,235
Nurse:
Are there any special instructions?

45
00:08:15,399 --> 00:08:19,233
Man: Just try to understand
what we're dealing with here.

46
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,276
Don't underestimate it.

47
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:23,511
Don't you think we could refer
to it as him?

48
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,990
If you say so.

49
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:30,312
Your compassion
is overwhelming, Doctor.

50
00:08:37,639 --> 00:08:40,028
What do I give him when we
take him in front of the judge?

51
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,157
Thorazine.

52
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,513
He'll barely be able to sit up.

53
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,239
That's the idea.

54
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,677
Nurse: You're serious
about it, aren't you?

55
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,831
Man: Yeah.

56
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,830
You mean you actually
never want him to get out?

57
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,071
- Never. Never.
- ( Thunder crashes )

58
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,957
Never.

59
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,639
Then why are we taking him up
to Harden County if you're just...

60
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:14,479
Because that is the law.

61
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,034
Here we are.

62
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,710
Since when do they let them
wander around?

63
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,874
Pull up to the main gate.

64
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,917
- Shouldn't we...
- Go on, move!

65
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:41,269
Stop here.

66
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:46,912
Shouldn't we go on up
to the hospital and...

67
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:48,878
Wait.

68
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:10,788
( Screams )

69
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,275
( tires squeal )

70
00:10:23,559 --> 00:10:26,200
( panting )

71
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,072
Oh!

72
00:10:47,159 --> 00:10:48,195
Are you all right?

73
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,873
- You all right?
- Yes, I'm okay.

74
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:51,798
He's gone. He's gone from here.

75
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,990
The evil is gone.

76
00:10:58,639 --> 00:11:00,870
Right, I've got it.

77
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:58,119
( Door opens )

78
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,357
Don't forget to drop the key
off at the Myers place.

79
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,796
I won't.

80
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,917
They're coming by to look
at the house at 10:30.

81
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,519
Be sure to leave it
under the mat.

82
00:12:07,679 --> 00:12:09,078
Promise.

83
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,230
( Car starts )

84
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,673
Laufie!

85
00:12:45,159 --> 00:12:46,639
Hi, Tommy.

86
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,316
- You coming over tonight?
- Same time, same place.

87
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,197
Can we make jack-o'-lanterns?

88
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,475
- Sure.
- And watch the monster movies?

89
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,073
- Sure.
- Will you read to me?

90
00:12:57,240 --> 00:13:00,038
- Can we make popcorn?
- Sure, sure, sure.

91
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,599
( laughs )

92
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,951
You better hurry up.

93
00:13:06,039 --> 00:13:08,110
How come you're walking
to school this way?

94
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,236
- My dad asked me to.
- Why?

95
00:13:10,399 --> 00:13:11,993
I have to drop off a key.

96
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,275
- Why?
- He's gonna sell a house.

97
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,676
- Why?
- Because that's his job.

98
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,399
- Where?
- The Myers house.

99
00:13:19,559 --> 00:13:21,197
Tommy: The Myers house?

100
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,636
You're not supposed
to go up there.

101
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:34,269
- Yes, I am.
- Uh-uh.

102
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,033
That's the spook house.

103
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:37,634
Just watch.

104
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:46,232
( Heavy breathing )

105
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:50,599
Lonnie Elam said
never to go up there.

106
00:13:50,759 --> 00:13:52,909
Lonnie Elam said
that's a haunted house.

107
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:55,196
He said awful stuff
happened there once.

108
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,509
Lonnie Elam probably
won't get out of the sixth grade.

109
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:00,193
I've got to go.
See you tonight.

110
00:14:00,399 --> 00:14:02,471
- Bye.
- Bye.

111
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:10,272
J" I wish I had you
all alone J".

112
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:13,750
- J " Just the two of us... J"
- ( Heavy breathing )

113
00:14:16,039 --> 00:14:18,679
( continues singing )

114
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:33,030
- I'm not responsible, Sam.
- Oh, no.

115
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,032
- I told them how dangerous he was.
- You couldn't have.

116
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:38,192
Two roadblocks and an all points
bulletin wouldn't stop a five-year-old.

117
00:14:38,334 --> 00:14:39,695
Well, he was your patient, Doctor.

118
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,312
If precautions weren't strong enough,
you should have told somebody.

119
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,591
I told everybody!
Nobody listened.

120
00:14:43,735 --> 00:14:44,934
There's nothing else I can do.

121
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,711
You can get back in there
and get back on that telephone

122
00:14:46,879 --> 00:14:48,711
and tell them exactly
who walked out of here last night

123
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,438
and tell them exactly
where he's going.

124
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:52,591
- Probably going.
- I'm wasting my time.

125
00:14:52,759 --> 00:14:54,797
Sam, Haddonfield
is 150 miles away from here.

126
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,600
Now, for God's sake,
he can't drive a car.

127
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,398
He was doing
very well last night.

128
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:01,073
Maybe someone around here
gave him lessons.

129
00:15:02,559 --> 00:15:04,437
( Car starts )

130
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,399
(woman speaking
over loudspeaker )

131
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:15,960
Teacher: And the book ends.

132
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,239
But what Samuels
is really talking about here

133
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,192
is fate.

134
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:25,515
You see, fate

135
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:28,513
caught up with
several lives here.

136
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:33,349
No matter what course of action
Collins took,

137
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:37,115
he was destined to his own fate.

138
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:41,318
His own day of reckoning
with himself.

139
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,597
The idea is

140
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:48,115
that destiny is a very real,

141
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:52,591
concrete thing that every person
has to deal with.

142
00:15:52,799 --> 00:15:55,474
How does Samuels view of fate

143
00:15:55,679 --> 00:15:58,638
differ from that of Costaine's?
Laufie?

144
00:15:58,799 --> 00:16:00,836
- Ma'am?
- Answer the question.

145
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:04,038
Oh, um,
Costaine wrote that fate

146
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,076
was somehow related
only to religion,

147
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,073
whereas Samuels felt that fate
was like a natural element

148
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:12,032
like earth, air, fire, and water.

149
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,789
That's right.
Samuels definitely personified fate.

150
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,793
In Samuels' writing,
fate is immovable

151
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,188
like a mountain.

152
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:23,113
It stands where man
passes away.

153
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,509
Fate never changes.

154
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:27,909
- ( School bell ringing )
- ( Children shouting )

155
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:46,033
He's got a pumpkin.

156
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:47,918
Yeah, how's the little witches?

157
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,308
Yeah, you have a pumpkin.

158
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,674
Leave me alone.

159
00:16:50,840 --> 00:16:52,600
Boys: He's gonna get you.
He's gonna get you.

160
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:56,634
He's gonna get you.
He's gonna get you.

161
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,552
The boogeyman is coming.

162
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,836
- Leave me alone.
- He doesn't believe us.

163
00:17:01,039 --> 00:17:03,076
Don't you know what happens
on Halloween?

164
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,833
Yeah, we get candy.

165
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,236
- ( laughs )
- The boogeyman.

166
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:10,596
The boogeyman. The boogeyman.
The boogeyman. The boogeyman.

167
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,676
The boogeyman.

168
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,190
( Boys laughing )

169
00:17:22,839 --> 00:17:25,958
( breathing heavily )

170
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:52,108
( car starts )

171
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,993
He's on his way.

172
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,198
You've got to believe me, Officer.

173
00:18:49,359 --> 00:18:51,396
He is coming to Haddonfield.

174
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:54,358
Because I know him.

175
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:56,635
I'm his doctor.

176
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,790
You must be ready for him.

177
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,398
If you don't,
it's your funeral.

178
00:19:01,559 --> 00:19:04,278
( Train crossing bell dinging )

179
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,478
( train whistle blowing )

180
00:19:54,039 --> 00:19:56,111
Girls: We're from Haddonfield,
couldn't be prouder.

181
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:58,476
Can't hear us now,
we'll yell a little louder.

182
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,711
We're from Haddonfield,
couldn't be prouder.

183
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:03,519
Oh, look at you.
Look at all the books you have.

184
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,232
You need a shopping cart
to get home.

185
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,835
( laughs )

186
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,673
Girls: Yay, Haddonfield!

187
00:20:09,839 --> 00:20:12,638
Yeah, not funny.

188
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,438
You know, it's totally insane.

189
00:20:14,599 --> 00:20:16,519
We have three new cheers
to learn in the morning.

190
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,038
The game is in the afternoon.

191
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:20,559
I have to get my hair done at 5:00
and the dance is at 8:00.

192
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,000
I'll be totally wiped out.

193
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,388
I don't think you have
enough to do tomorrow.

194
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:25,038
Totally.

195
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,830
As usual, I have nothing to do.

196
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:34,759
It's your own fault and I don't
feel a bit sorry for you.

197
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,356
Hey, Lynda, Laurie.

198
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:40,750
Why didn't you wait for me?

199
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,877
We did. 15 minutes.
You totally never showed.

200
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:45,552
That's not true. Here I am.

201
00:20:48,599 --> 00:20:50,161
What's wrong, Annie?
You're not smiling.

202
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:52,077
I'm never smiling again.

203
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,834
Paul dragged me into
the boys' locker room.

204
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,751
Exploring uncharted territory?

205
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,911
- It's been totally charted.
- We just talked.

206
00:20:59,079 --> 00:21:00,433
Sure, sure.

207
00:21:00,599 --> 00:21:03,432
Old jerko got caught throwing
eggs and soaping windows.

208
00:21:03,599 --> 00:21:06,512
His parents grounded him.
He can't come over tonight.

209
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:08,119
Thought you were
babysitting tonight.

210
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,913
The only reason she babysits
is to have a place to...

211
00:21:10,119 --> 00:21:11,315
Shit.

212
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:14,393
I have a place for that.

213
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,914
I forgot my chemistry book.

214
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:19,594
So who cares?
I always forget my chemistry book,

215
00:21:19,759 --> 00:21:21,592
and my math book,
and my English book,

216
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:23,393
and my, let's see,
my French book.

217
00:21:23,559 --> 00:21:25,436
Who needs books anyway?
I don't need books.

218
00:21:25,599 --> 00:21:27,272
I always forget all of my books.

219
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:30,192
I mean, it doesn't really matter
if you have your books or not.

220
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,992
Lynda:
Hey, isn't that Devon Graham?

221
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,197
I don't think so.

222
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,277
I think he's cute.

223
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,157
Hey, jerk.

224
00:21:45,359 --> 00:21:47,351
Speed kills.

225
00:21:47,519 --> 00:21:50,717
( Tires squeal )

226
00:21:57,759 --> 00:21:59,990
God, can't you take a joke?

227
00:22:07,319 --> 00:22:10,278
You know, Annie, someday you're
gonna get us all into deep trouble.

228
00:22:13,279 --> 00:22:14,509
Totally.

229
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:17,832
I hate a guy with a car
and no sense of humor.

230
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:22,073
Well, are we still on
for tonight?

231
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,311
I wouldn't want to get you
in deep trouble, Lynda.

232
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,278
Oh, come on, Annie.

233
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,909
Bob and I have been
planning on it all week.

234
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:31,433
All right.

235
00:22:31,599 --> 00:22:33,192
The Wallaces leave at 7:00.

236
00:22:33,359 --> 00:22:36,159
I'm babysitting the Doyles.
It's only three houses down.

237
00:22:36,319 --> 00:22:38,240
- We can keep each other company.
- Oh, terrific.

238
00:22:38,319 --> 00:22:41,199
I've got three choices...
watch the kid sleep,

239
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:44,272
listen to Lynda screw around,
or talk to you.

240
00:22:48,119 --> 00:22:50,111
Boy, I was so mad.

241
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:52,476
( Chatter continues )

242
00:23:17,079 --> 00:23:18,558
Want to go buy your own?

243
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,472
You've bummed plenty
off of me, girl.

244
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,950
- What time tonight?
- I don't know yet.

245
00:23:24,119 --> 00:23:25,997
I have to get out of taking
my little brother trick-or-treating.

246
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:29,278
- Saving the treats for Bob?
- Funny. See ya.

247
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,157
- Bye.
- Bye.

248
00:23:44,079 --> 00:23:45,400
Annie, look.

249
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:47,073
Look where?

250
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,277
Behind the bush.

251
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,192
I don't see anything.

252
00:23:51,359 --> 00:23:53,749
The man who drove by so fast,
that one you yelled at.

253
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,594
Subtle, isn't he?

254
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:05,596
Hey, creep.

255
00:24:08,119 --> 00:24:09,792
Laufie, dean.

256
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:12,348
He wants to talk to you.

257
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:14,829
He wants to take you
out tonight.

258
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:30,792
He was standing right there.

259
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:32,633
Poor Laurie.

260
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,871
Scared another one away.

261
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,792
It's tragic. You never go out.

262
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,634
You must have a small fortune
stashed from babysitting so much.

263
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:43,153
Guys think I'm too smart.

264
00:24:43,319 --> 00:24:45,038
I don't. I think you're wacko.

265
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,476
Now you're seeing men
behind bushes.

266
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:51,996
Well, home sweet home.

267
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:54,720
See you later.

268
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,472
- Bye.
- Bye.

269
00:25:05,759 --> 00:25:08,194
(wind blowing )

270
00:25:09,839 --> 00:25:11,432
( screams )

271
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,828
Excuse me, Laurie.

272
00:25:12,974 --> 00:25:14,615
Oh, Mr. Brackett.
I'm sorry, Mr. Brackett.

273
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,869
- I didn't mean to startle you.
- That's all right.

274
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,872
You know it's Halloween.

275
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,039
I guess everyone's entitled
to one good scare, huh?

276
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,838
Yes, sir. Nice seeing you, sir.

277
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:48,395
(girl laughs)

278
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,076
( laughter)

279
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,791
- Trick or treat.
- Trick or treat.

280
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:08,230
(children laughing)

281
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,152
Well, kiddo,

282
00:26:10,319 --> 00:26:12,913
I thought you outgrew
superstition.

283
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:28,430
(wind blowing )

284
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,789
( phone ringing )

285
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:03,154
Hello?

286
00:27:03,319 --> 00:27:05,960
( Crunching )

287
00:27:06,119 --> 00:27:08,111
Hello?

288
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,996
Who is this?

289
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,393
( Phone rings )

290
00:27:21,519 --> 00:27:22,634
Hello?

291
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,153
Annie: Why'd you hang up on me?

292
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:27,118
- Annie? Was that you?
- Of course.

293
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:29,319
Why didn't you say anything?
You scared me to death.

294
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,391
I had my mouth full.
Couldn't you hear me?

295
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:33,079
I thought it was
an obscene phone call.

296
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,197
Now you hear obscene chewing.

297
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:37,589
- You're losing it, Laurie.
- I already lost it.

298
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,153
I doubt that.

299
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:41,039
Listen, my mother
is letting me use her car.

300
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:42,433
I'll pick you up at 6:30.

301
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:44,636
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

302
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,836
Just calm down.

303
00:28:00,079 --> 00:28:01,990
This is ridiculous.

304
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:20,308
- Hurry up.
- Hi.

305
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,949
( Music playing on radio )

306
00:29:29,119 --> 00:29:31,588
We just have time.

307
00:29:42,599 --> 00:29:45,114
Yeah, Judith Myers.

308
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:46,713
Myers.

309
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:49,440
Row 18, plot 20.

310
00:29:51,079 --> 00:29:54,117
You know, every town
has something like this happen.

311
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,231
I remember over in Russellville,

312
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,114
old Charlie Bowles
about 15 years ago,

313
00:30:00,279 --> 00:30:02,874
one night he finished dinner

314
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:06,476
and he excused himself
from the table

315
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,676
and he went out to the garage

316
00:30:08,839 --> 00:30:12,628
and he got himself a hacksaw.

317
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,790
And then he went
back into the house

318
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,719
and he kissed his wife and his
two children good-bye

319
00:30:17,920 --> 00:30:19,637
and then he proceeded...

320
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:21,871
- Where are we?
- Huh? Oh.

321
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:23,951
It's right over here.

322
00:30:24,119 --> 00:30:27,317
Yeah, Myers. Judith Myers.
I remember her.

323
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,757
Couldn't believe it.
Such a young boy.

324
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,355
Are we lost?

325
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,711
Why do they do it?
Goddamn kids.

326
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,876
They'll do anything
for Halloween.

327
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,150
- Whose grave was it?
- Oh, I don't know.

328
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,836
18, 19...

329
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,076
Judith Myers.

330
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,711
He came home.

331
00:31:02,359 --> 00:31:03,919
Still spooked?

332
00:31:04,079 --> 00:31:06,037
I wasn't spooked.

333
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:08,237
- Lies.
- I wasn't.

334
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,356
I saw somebody standing
in Mr. Riddle's backyard.

335
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:12,829
- Probably Mr. Riddle.
- He was watching me.

336
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:16,709
Mr. Riddle was watching you?
Laurie, Mr. Riddle is 87.

337
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,712
- Laurie: He could still watch.
- It's probably all he can do.

338
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,195
- What's the pumpkin for?
- I brought it for Tommy.

339
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,278
I figured carving a jack-o'-lantern
would keep him occupied.

340
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:28,953
I always said you'd make
a fabulous Girl Scout.

341
00:31:29,119 --> 00:31:30,315
Thanks.

342
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:33,000
For that matter, I might as well
be a Girl Scout myself tonight.

343
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:36,152
I plan on making popcorn
and watching Dr. Dementia.

344
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:38,549
Six straight hours
of horror movies.

345
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,950
Little Lindsey Wallace
won't know what hit her.

346
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:42,679
(coughing )

347
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,919
My dad! Get rid of this.

348
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,309
( Alarm ringing )

349
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,957
- ( coughing )
- Laurie, stop coughing.

350
00:32:04,095 --> 00:32:05,734
- What's the matter with you?
- Oh, Jesus.

351
00:32:05,759 --> 00:32:07,557
Annie: Just be natural.
There he is.

352
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,551
Just be natural, Laurie.

353
00:32:14,279 --> 00:32:15,952
Hi, Annie. Laurie.

354
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:18,878
Hi, Dad. What happened?

355
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:20,912
- What?
- What happened?

356
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:23,269
Oh, somebody broke into
the hardware store.

357
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,555
Probably kids.

358
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,314
You blame everything on kids.

359
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,356
All they took was
a Halloween mask,

360
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:32,353
rope, and a couple of knives.
Who do you think it was?

361
00:32:32,519 --> 00:32:35,239
It's hard growing up
with a cynical father.

362
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,755
- Aren't you gonna be late?
- Huh?

363
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,036
- I said aren't you gonna be late?
- ( Alarm stops )

364
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,032
He shouts, too.

365
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:47,118
BVG, girls.

366
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:49,191
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

367
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,957
Sheriff.

368
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:01,116
Pardon me, I'm Loomis.

369
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:03,191
- Dr. Sam Loomis.
- Lee Brackett.

370
00:33:03,359 --> 00:33:05,079
I'd like to have a word
with you if I could.

371
00:33:05,160 --> 00:33:06,513
May be a few minutes.
I've got to take care...

372
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,239
it is important.

373
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,675
- 10 minutes.
- I'll be here.

374
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:27,992
What's the matter with you?

375
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,470
I think he knew.
I'm sure he could smell it.

376
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,711
- No, he didn't.
- He did.

377
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,518
See the look on his face?

378
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:37,319
He always looks like that.

379
00:33:40,015 --> 00:33:42,055
What are you gonna wear
to the dance tomorrow night?

380
00:33:42,079 --> 00:33:44,640
I didn't know you thought
about things like that, Laurie.

381
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:53,352
You know, you could
ask somebody.

382
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:54,953
- No, I couldn't.
- Sure, you could.

383
00:33:55,119 --> 00:33:57,395
All you have to do is go
up to somebody and say,

384
00:33:57,559 --> 00:33:59,436
"You want to go to the dance?"

385
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,393
You could do that. I couldn't.

386
00:34:02,599 --> 00:34:05,876
Well, you could ask Dick Baxter.
He'd go out with you.

387
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:09,157
I'd rather go out
with Ben Tramer.

388
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:11,833
Ben Tramer?

389
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,797
I knew it.

390
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,552
( laughs )

391
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:18,757
So you do think
about things like that, huh, Laurie?

392
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,273
Shut up.

393
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:22,829
He's cute. Ben Tramer.

394
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,434
Shh.

395
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:59,070
- Okay, see you later.
- Bye.

396
00:35:30,519 --> 00:35:33,876
Kids: Trick or treat, give me
something good to eat.

397
00:35:34,039 --> 00:35:37,795
Trick or treat, trick or treat,
give me something good to eat.

398
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:40,679
Trick or treat, trick or treat,
give me something...

399
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:51,237
( knocks )

400
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,512
- Hi.
- Man: Hi, Annie.

401
00:35:54,679 --> 00:35:56,478
- Come on in.
- How you doing tonight?

402
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:58,994
Annie: What time do you
want her in bed?

403
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:01,356
Woman: Be in bed by 9:00, okay?

404
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:02,873
- Have a good night, dear.
- Be a good girl.

405
00:36:03,039 --> 00:36:04,677
- Bye-bye.
- Good-bye.

406
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,429
Does anybody live here?

407
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,193
Not since 1963 when it happened.

408
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:36,556
Every kid in Haddonfield
thinks this place is haunted.

409
00:36:36,719 --> 00:36:38,630
They may be right.

410
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:57,599
- Look.
- What?

411
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,592
- What is that?
- It's a dog.

412
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,876
It's still warm.

413
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,309
He got hungfY-

414
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:15,715
Come on.
It could have been a skunk.

415
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,398
Could have.

416
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:19,914
A man wouldn't do that.

417
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,956
This is no man.

418
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:00,518
It happened in here.

419
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:03,478
She was sitting right here.

420
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,157
He could have seen her
through this window.

421
00:38:15,239 --> 00:38:18,119
Standing on the lawn,
he could have seen inside.

422
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,791
You must think me
a very sinister doctor.

423
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:33,349
( Chuckles ) Oh, I...

424
00:38:33,519 --> 00:38:35,989
I do have a permit.

425
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:39,317
It seems to me
you're just plain scared.

426
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:42,552
Yes. Yeah, I am.

427
00:38:42,719 --> 00:38:45,951
I met him 15 years ago.

428
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:48,269
I was told there was nothing left.

429
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,320
No reason, no conscience,
no understanding.

430
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,358
Even the most rudimentary
sense of life or death,

431
00:38:55,559 --> 00:38:59,599
of good or evil,
right or wrong.

432
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,195
I met this six-year-old child

433
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,119
with this blank, pale,

434
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,436
emotionless face

435
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:11,353
with the blackest eyes.

436
00:39:11,519 --> 00:39:13,875
The devil's eyes.

437
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:17,509
I spent eight years
trying to reach him.

438
00:39:17,679 --> 00:39:20,148
And then another seven
trying to keep him locked up

439
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:23,391
because I realized that what
was living behind that boy's eyes

440
00:39:23,559 --> 00:39:26,393
was purely and simply evil.

441
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:28,954
What do we do?

442
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,235
He's been here once tonight.

443
00:39:31,400 --> 00:39:33,436
I think he'll come back.

444
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:35,313
I'm going to wait for him.

445
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:37,641
I still think I should notify
the radio and television.

446
00:39:37,679 --> 00:39:40,911
No. If you do that, they'll see him
on every street corner.

447
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,480
They'll look for him
in every house.

448
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:46,195
Just tell your men to keep their
mouths shut and their eyes open.

449
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,518
I'll check back in an hour.

450
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:03,599
"'How now, ' cried Arthur."

451
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,148
'Let no one pass this way
without a fight.'

452
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:09,597
"'Is that so?' said the knight
in a bold and haughty manner."

453
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:12,268
I don't like that story.

454
00:40:12,440 --> 00:40:14,077
I thought King Arthur
was your favorite.

455
00:40:14,239 --> 00:40:16,277
Not anymore.

456
00:40:18,239 --> 00:40:19,519
Why do you keep them
under there?

457
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:21,637
Mom doesn't like me
to have them.

458
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,791
"Laser Man."

459
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,952
"Neutron Man."
I can understand why.

460
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:28,952
"Tarantula Man."

461
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:32,271
Laurie, what's the boogeyman?

462
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:34,077
( Phone ringing )

463
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,432
Doyle residence.

464
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:41,715
Annie: It's me.

465
00:40:41,880 --> 00:40:43,108
Hi, Annie. What are you doing?

466
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,679
Making popcorn.

467
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:48,673
Having fun?
Never mind. I'm sure you are.

468
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:51,952
I have big, big news for you.

469
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:53,713
(growling )

470
00:40:53,880 --> 00:40:55,791
- ( barking )
- Oops.

471
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,269
- Hold on a minute.
- ( Barking )

472
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:00,077
Hi, Lester.

473
00:41:00,239 --> 00:41:03,277
I'm about to be ripped apart
by the family dog.

474
00:41:03,480 --> 00:41:05,471
( laughs )

475
00:41:05,639 --> 00:41:08,951
( dog barking )

476
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:12,954
Lindsey, get this dog
out of the kitchen right now.

477
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:14,952
(Tv playing )

478
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,708
I hate that dog.

479
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:27,474
I'm the only person in the world
he doesn't like.

480
00:41:27,639 --> 00:41:30,632
So what is this big, big news?

481
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:32,159
What would you say
if I told you

482
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:35,233
that you were going to the homecoming
dance tomorrow night?

483
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:37,914
( Scoffs ) I'd probably say
you got the wrong number.

484
00:41:38,079 --> 00:41:42,755
Well, I just talked
with Ben Tramer

485
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,512
and he got real excited

486
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:47,320
when I told him how attracted
you were to him.

487
00:41:47,519 --> 00:41:49,829
Oh, Annie. Oh, you didn't.

488
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:52,992
Please tell me you didn't.
How could you do that?

489
00:41:53,159 --> 00:41:54,833
I mean, how could you
just call him?

490
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,273
( Kids laughing )

491
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,715
Laufie:
What do you mean it was easy?

492
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,836
I can't believe it.

493
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,798
( Kids laughing )

494
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,036
Please tell me you didn't.

495
00:42:11,199 --> 00:42:12,952
Oh, you didn't.

496
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:14,918
- Laurie.
- Oh, I'm so embarrassed.

497
00:42:15,079 --> 00:42:17,070
- I couldn't even face him.
- The boogeyman is outside.

498
00:42:17,239 --> 00:42:19,117
- Laurie, he's out there.
- Hold on.

499
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,954
Laurie, the boogeyman is outside.
Look.

500
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:29,871
Tommy, there's nobody outside.

501
00:42:30,039 --> 00:42:32,190
Go watch TV.

502
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:33,878
It's just Tommy.

503
00:42:35,239 --> 00:42:38,436
Oh, please tell me you didn't.
How could you do that?

504
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:42,358
Look, it's simple.
You like him, he likes you.

505
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:44,351
All you need is a little push.

506
00:42:45,360 --> 00:42:48,159
Well, it won't hurt you to go out
with him, for God's sake.

507
00:42:48,320 --> 00:42:49,992
Shit!

508
00:42:50,159 --> 00:42:51,911
No, no.

509
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,990
I just made a mess of myself.
I've got to call you back.

510
00:42:54,159 --> 00:42:56,913
Oh, yuck. Lindsey.

511
00:42:57,079 --> 00:42:59,434
I need a robe.

512
00:42:59,599 --> 00:43:02,159
(Tv playing )

513
00:43:05,039 --> 00:43:07,315
( breathing heavily )

514
00:43:20,039 --> 00:43:22,190
( shatters )

515
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:32,630
Annie:
This ain't ever coming out.

516
00:43:35,639 --> 00:43:38,108
(growling )

517
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:41,032
( barking )

518
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:45,193
Lindsey, Lester's barking again

519
00:43:45,360 --> 00:43:47,748
and getting on my nerves again.

520
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,518
( Dog whines )

521
00:43:50,679 --> 00:43:52,717
Never mind.

522
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,952
Guess he found a hot date.

523
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,876
(jingle playing )

524
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,472
What about the jack-o'-lantern?

525
00:44:44,639 --> 00:44:46,119
After the movie.

526
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:48,351
What about the rest
of my comic books?

527
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,793
After the jack-o'-lantern.

528
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,190
What about the boogeyman?

529
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,713
There's no such thing.

530
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:55,956
Richie said he was
coming after me tonight.

531
00:44:56,119 --> 00:44:57,393
Do you believe everything
Richie tells you?

532
00:44:57,559 --> 00:44:59,516
No.

533
00:44:59,679 --> 00:45:01,318
Tommy, Halloween night,

534
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:03,197
it's when people play tricks
on each other.

535
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:04,509
It's all make-believe.

536
00:45:04,719 --> 00:45:06,440
I think Richie was
just trying to scare you.

537
00:45:06,559 --> 00:45:08,277
I saw the boogeyman.

538
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,157
I saw him outside.

539
00:45:10,320 --> 00:45:11,992
There was nobody outside.

540
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:15,391
- There was.
- What did he look like?

541
00:45:15,559 --> 00:45:17,039
The boogeyman.

542
00:45:18,079 --> 00:45:19,878
We're not getting anywhere.

543
00:45:20,039 --> 00:45:23,635
All right, the boogeyman can only
come out on Halloween night, right?

544
00:45:23,800 --> 00:45:25,757
- Right.
- Well, I'm here tonight.

545
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:27,911
I'm not about to let anything
happen to you.

546
00:45:28,119 --> 00:45:31,431
- Promise?
- Promise.

547
00:45:31,599 --> 00:45:33,715
Can we make
the jack-o'-lantern now?

548
00:45:35,199 --> 00:45:36,918
Let's go.

549
00:45:49,159 --> 00:45:51,719
( Pounds )

550
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:59,197
( flips switch )

551
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,152
Oh, terrific.

552
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,510
( SighS )

553
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:19,630
Hello?

554
00:46:21,159 --> 00:46:22,672
Who's there?

555
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:27,592
Paul, is this one
of your cheap tricks?

556
00:46:31,159 --> 00:46:32,833
Guess not.

557
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,038
No tricks for Annie tonight.

558
00:46:51,679 --> 00:46:53,239
( Groans )

559
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,516
Lindsey!

560
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:57,829
Lindsey, come out here!

561
00:46:58,039 --> 00:47:00,394
Lindsey,
I'm in the laundry room.

562
00:47:00,559 --> 00:47:01,880
The door won't open.

563
00:47:02,039 --> 00:47:03,320
Man on TV:
Spread out, everybody.

564
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:05,519
We're gonna try to figure out
the shape of this thing.

565
00:47:05,639 --> 00:47:08,836
Holy cats. Hey.

566
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,197
Yeah, almost a perfect...

567
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,431
( phone ringing )

568
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:17,393
- We finally got one.
- We found a flying saucer.

569
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,876
Oh, Lindsey, get the phone.
It's Paul.

570
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:23,759
- ( Rattling )
- Lindsey!

571
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:27,389
Lindsey!

572
00:47:36,239 --> 00:47:38,550
Paul, don't hang up.

573
00:47:45,079 --> 00:47:47,753
( Phone ringing )

574
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:49,751
Hello?

575
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:51,318
Hi, Lindsey. This is Paul.

576
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:53,471
- Is Annie there?
- Yes, she is.

577
00:47:53,679 --> 00:47:55,239
Get her for me, will you?

578
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:57,197
She's washing her clothes.

579
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:59,157
Look, just tell her it's me, okay?

580
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,958
Okay.

581
00:48:06,039 --> 00:48:07,871
Annie, Paul called.

582
00:48:08,039 --> 00:48:09,871
Annie: Ow!

583
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:23,717
- You locked yourself in.
- I know.

584
00:48:26,039 --> 00:48:28,349
Pull my foot. I'm stuck.

585
00:48:38,679 --> 00:48:40,431
Oh.

586
00:48:43,480 --> 00:48:45,550
( Clatters )

587
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:50,271
Now promise me you won't
tell anybody about this.

588
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:55,032
( SighS )

589
00:49:01,039 --> 00:49:02,996
( phone ringing )

590
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,514
She got stuck in the window.
She'll be right here.

591
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:16,197
- Hello.
- Paul: Hi, Annie.

592
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:18,510
- Oh, hi, Paul.
- Stuck, huh?

593
00:49:18,719 --> 00:49:21,599
All right, cut it out.
It could happen to anyone.

594
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:23,318
Sure, stuck in a window.

595
00:49:23,519 --> 00:49:26,637
Yeah, but I've seen you stuck
in plenty of other positions.

596
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:27,994
My parents are gone.

597
00:49:28,159 --> 00:49:30,833
Oh, that's fabulous.
When did they leave?

598
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,391
- About half hour ago.
- Oh, utterly fantastic.

599
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:37,791
( laughs )
Why don't you just walk over?

600
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,358
You come and pick me up.

601
00:49:39,519 --> 00:49:41,351
Well, I can't come now.
My clothes are in the wash.

602
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:43,795
- Won't need 'em.
- Oh, shut up, jerk.

603
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,072
God, I've got a shirt on.
That's all you ever think about.

604
00:49:47,239 --> 00:49:49,231
I think that's all you
ever think about.

605
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:51,356
That's not true.
I think about lots of things.

606
00:49:51,519 --> 00:49:53,480
Now why don't we not stand
here talking about them

607
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:55,909
and get down to doing them?

608
00:49:56,079 --> 00:49:58,195
Man on TV: Lock your doors,

609
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:02,751
bolt your windows,
and turn off the lights.

610
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:05,911
Don't go away
'cause here's a scene...

611
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:07,478
I'm scared.

612
00:50:07,639 --> 00:50:09,516
Well, why are you sitting here
with all the lights off?

613
00:50:09,679 --> 00:50:10,715
I don't know.

614
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:12,836
Well, come on, get your coat.
We're going to pick up Paul.

615
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,036
I don't want to.

616
00:50:15,239 --> 00:50:17,708
Look, Lindsey, I thought
we understood each other.

617
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:19,871
I want to stay here
and watch this.

618
00:50:20,039 --> 00:50:21,235
Okay.

619
00:50:21,400 --> 00:50:23,960
If I can fix it so you can watch
TV with Tommy Doyle,

620
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:25,878
- would you like that?
- Yeah.

621
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:28,117
Well, come with me.

622
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:34,835
- ( Giggles)
- Come on, hurry up.

623
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:36,751
( Iaughiﬂg )

624
00:50:52,239 --> 00:50:54,753
( breathing heavily )

625
00:50:57,880 --> 00:51:00,030
( doorbell rings )

626
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:05,880
Annie: Hi, Tommy.

627
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:08,958
Hi. Come on in.
We're making a jack-o'-lantern.

628
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,315
Lindsey: I want to watch TV.

629
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,311
Laurie: Annie, I'm in here.

630
00:51:14,480 --> 00:51:17,916
Man on TV:
And now the horrifying conclusion

631
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,594
to "The Thing."

632
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:24,313
Oh, fancy.

633
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:26,835
This has not been my night.

634
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:30,277
I spilled butter
all over my clothes.

635
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:32,197
They're in the wash.
I got stuck in the laundry room.

636
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:33,958
I want to tell you something.
I'd like you to call Ben Tramer

637
00:51:34,119 --> 00:51:35,474
and tell him that you
were just fooling around.

638
00:51:35,639 --> 00:51:36,755
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

639
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:39,833
No, he went drinking with Mike Godfrey
and he won't be back till late.

640
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:42,195
You'll have to call him tomorrow.

641
00:51:42,360 --> 00:51:45,909
Besides, I'm on my way
to pick up Paul.

642
00:51:46,119 --> 00:51:47,315
Wait a minute.

643
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:51,030
If you watch her, I'll consider
talking to Ben Tramer

644
00:51:51,199 --> 00:51:52,679
in the morning.

645
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,358
- Deal.
- ( Laughs )

646
00:51:54,519 --> 00:51:56,157
I thought Paul was grounded.

647
00:51:56,320 --> 00:51:58,469
He was.
Old jerko found a way to sneak out.

648
00:51:58,639 --> 00:52:01,153
Listen, I'll call you
in an hour or so, okay?

649
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:02,309
Yeah.

650
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,311
- Bye.
- Bye.

651
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,599
The old Girl Scout
comes through again.

652
00:52:14,519 --> 00:52:16,829

658
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,440
J " Oh, Paul J".

659
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:10,829
J " I can no longer stall J".

( horn blaring )

672
00:54:21,960 --> 00:54:23,597
Attention, captain to crew.

673
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:24,989
Stand by to reverse polarity.

674
00:54:25,159 --> 00:54:28,596
Standard class A security
will be maintained upon landing.

675
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,990
And until further notice,
all hands will wear sidearms.

676
00:54:32,199 --> 00:54:34,635
That is all.
Artificial gravity off.

677
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:37,713
- Cut primary coils.
- Primaries cut, sir.

678
00:55:02,360 --> 00:55:04,396
(whispering ) Lindsey.

679
00:55:04,559 --> 00:55:07,677
- Lindsey.
- Where are you?

680
00:55:32,039 --> 00:55:33,632
( Both scream )

681
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,710
Laurie, it's the boogeyman.
I saw him outside.

682
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:37,552
It's the boogeyman.
He's outside.

683
00:55:37,719 --> 00:55:39,710
I saw the boogeyman.
He's outside.

684
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:42,190
- I saw the boogeyman.
- Oh, Tommy, stop it.

685
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,878
- But I really saw him.
- You're scaring Lindsey.

686
00:55:44,039 --> 00:55:45,871
- He's over there.
- Tommy, stop it.

687
00:55:46,039 --> 00:55:48,998
Now, there's nobody out there.
There's no boogeyman.

688
00:55:49,159 --> 00:55:51,389
And if you don't stop all this,
I'm gonna have to turn off the TV

689
00:55:51,559 --> 00:55:52,880
and send you to bed.

690
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,590
Nobody believes me.

691
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,751
I believe you, Tommy.

692
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:05,391
( Scoffs )

693
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,757
- I'm not afraid.
- Bull.

694
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,956
- I'm not.
- Then go in.

695
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:47,360
- Chicken.
- Go ahead, Lonnie.

696
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:50,478
Go in.

697
00:56:53,239 --> 00:56:54,913
(Whispers ) Hey.

698
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:58,755
Hey, Lonnie.
Get your ass away from there.

699
00:57:11,159 --> 00:57:13,117
- Jesus.
- Are you all right?

700
00:57:13,320 --> 00:57:14,992
Yeah.

701
00:57:15,199 --> 00:57:18,112
Nothing's going on except
kids playing pranks,

702
00:57:18,280 --> 00:57:20,954
trick-or-treating,
parking, getting high.

703
00:57:21,159 --> 00:57:23,070
I have a feeling that
you're way off on this.

704
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:24,798
You have the wrong feeling.

705
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,797
Well, you're not doing very much
to prove me wrong.

706
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,512
What more do you need?

707
00:57:28,679 --> 00:57:30,398
It's gonna take more
than fancy talk

708
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:32,471
to keep me up all night
crawling around these bushes.

709
00:57:32,639 --> 00:57:35,153
I watched him for 15 years

710
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:38,710
sitting in a room staring at a wall,
not seeing the wall,

711
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:42,077
looking past the wall,
looking at this night.

712
00:57:42,239 --> 00:57:43,913
Inhumanly patient.

713
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:48,353
Waiting for some secret
silent alarm

714
00:57:48,519 --> 00:57:50,635
to trigger him off.

715
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:54,509
Death has come
to your little town, Sheriff.

716
00:57:54,679 --> 00:57:57,797
You can either ignore it
or you can help me to stop it.

717
00:57:57,960 --> 00:57:59,996
More fancy talk.

718
00:58:00,199 --> 00:58:02,429
Doctor, do you know
what Haddonfield is?

719
00:58:02,599 --> 00:58:05,353
Families, children,
all lined up in rows

720
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:06,954
up and down these streets.

721
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:09,077
You're telling me they're lined up
for a slaughterhouse.

722
00:58:09,239 --> 00:58:10,878
They could be.

723
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,076
All right,
I'll stay with you here tonight,

724
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:16,231
just on the chance
that you're right.

725
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,711
And if you are right,
damn you for letting him go.

726
00:58:38,320 --> 00:58:40,038
( Lynda giggles )

727
00:58:41,599 --> 00:58:43,273
Okay, this is what
we're gonna do.

728
00:58:43,440 --> 00:58:45,795
First we go inside, right?
Then we'll just talk a little.

729
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,150
Then Annie will distract Lindsey.
That's when we go upstairs

730
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,391
to the first bedroom on the left.
You got it?

731
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:52,358
Okay, first I rip your clothes off.

732
00:58:52,519 --> 00:58:55,398
Don't rip my blouse.
It's expensive, idiot.

733
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:56,789
Then you rip my clothes off.

734
00:58:56,960 --> 00:58:59,240
Then we rip Lindsey's clothes off.
Yeah, I think I got it.

735
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:02,000
Totally. ( Laughs )

736

No. No.

( Squeals )

740
00:59:20,519 --> 00:59:22,750
Bob, put me down.

741
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:25,594
Put me down.
This is totally silly.

742
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,239
Put me down.

743
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,471
- Hey, it's totally dark.
- Yeah.

744
00:59:32,639 --> 00:59:34,550
Annie.

745
00:59:34,719 --> 00:59:36,791
Annie, we're here.

746
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:38,438
I wonder where they went.

747
00:59:38,599 --> 00:59:41,432
Oh, Annie probably took
Lindsey out for something.

748
00:59:41,639 --> 00:59:43,597
( Door closes )

749
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,632
Let's look for a note.

750
00:59:51,800 --> 00:59:53,757
Let's don't.

751
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:02,755

Oooh.

754
01:00:27,639 --> 01:00:30,358
- He's gonna get you.
- No, he's not.

755
01:00:30,559 --> 01:00:32,994
Hey, nobody's getting anybody.
Stop scaring each other.

756
01:00:49,239 --> 01:00:51,356
Everybody's having
a good time tonight.

757
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,039
All right, you guys,
what's next?

758
01:00:54,199 --> 01:00:56,840
- Let's make more popcorn.
- No, we've had enough.

759
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,320
Why don't we watch
the rest of the movie?

760
01:00:58,480 --> 01:00:59,992
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

761

764
01:01:18,400 --> 01:01:19,992
Hi, Laurie. What's up?

765
01:01:20,159 --> 01:01:22,389
Just sitting down
for the first time tonight.

766
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,949
( laughs )
Hey, is Annie around?

767
01:01:25,159 --> 01:01:27,833
I thought she'd be home by now.
She went to pick up Paul.

768
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:30,719
Well, she's totally not here.

769
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,793
She probably
stopped off someplace.

770
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:35,195
Have her call me
when she gets home, though.

771
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:38,001
I have Lindsey here and I want to know
what time to put her to bed.

772
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:40,275
Okay. Later.

773
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,557
- Have a good time.
- We definitely will.

774
01:01:44,599 --> 01:01:46,398
Bye.

775
01:01:47,719 --> 01:01:50,155
Lindsey is gone for the night.

776

Lynda: Shit. Not again.

781
01:02:38,039 --> 01:02:39,996
I can't help it.
The phone keeps ringing.

782
01:02:40,159 --> 01:02:43,471
- And I can't keep you interested?
- Just answer the damn phone.

783
01:02:43,639 --> 01:02:46,153
I can't.
What if it's the Wallaces?

784
01:02:46,360 --> 01:02:48,317

- Totally.
- Yeah.

- Want a beer?
- Yeah.

Yeah.

gonna get me one.

Well, can't you answer me?

Okay, don't answer me.

01:19:27,439 --> 01:19:28,920
Get Lindsey
and lock the bedroom door.

893
01:19:28,960 --> 01:19:30,154
- I'm scared.
- Do as I say!

894
01:19:30,319 --> 01:19:32,515
- It's the boogeyman, isn't it?
- Hurry!

895
01:19:36,039 --> 01:19:37,359
( No dial tone )

896
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:39,476
( tapS )

897
01:19:43,760 --> 01:19:45,353
Oh, no.

898
01:20:00,159 --> 01:20:01,797
Please, stop.

899
01:20:01,960 --> 01:20:03,792
Please.

( sniffles )

903
01:21:17,920 --> 01:21:20,229
Where were you?
I went to the Myers house.

904
01:21:20,399 --> 01:21:22,277
I found the car. He's here.

905
01:21:22,479 --> 01:21:23,801
- Where?
- He's three blocks down.

906
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:25,239
You go back around
the back of the houses,

907
01:21:25,439 --> 01:21:26,760
I'll watch the front.

908
01:21:26,920 --> 01:21:28,592
- Go on!
- All right.

909
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,797
Tommy. Lindsey.

910
01:22:02,079 --> 01:22:03,957
Babies.

911
01:22:07,439 --> 01:22:08,918
We're gonna take a little walk.

912
01:22:09,079 --> 01:22:11,832
- Was it the boogeyman?
- I'm scared.

913
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,275
- There's nothing to be scared of.
- Are you sure?

914
01:22:16,399 --> 01:22:19,153
- How?
- I killed him.

915
01:22:19,319 --> 01:22:22,073
You can't kill the boogeyman.

916
01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:24,708
( Kids scream )

917
01:22:24,880 --> 01:22:26,837
Get in there. Come on, Tommy.

918
01:22:27,039 --> 01:22:28,632
Now lock the door.

919

926
01:25:07,319 --> 01:25:09,550
Unlock the door.

927
01:25:12,479 --> 01:25:14,118
Come here.

928
01:25:14,279 --> 01:25:16,112
Just listen to me.

929
01:25:16,279 --> 01:25:19,476
I want you to go down the stairs
and out the front door.

930
01:25:19,640 --> 01:25:22,154
I want you to go down the street
to the Mackenzies' house.

931
01:25:22,319 --> 01:25:24,675
I want you to tell them
to call the police

932
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:26,478
and tell them
to send them over here.

933
01:25:26,680 --> 01:25:28,318
- Laurie.
- Do you understand me?

934
01:25:28,479 --> 01:25:30,311
- Yes.
- Go do as I say.

936
01:25:53,039 --> 01:25:55,475

(thuds)

943
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:21,829
it was the boogeyman.

944
01:27:26,840 --> 01:27:29,309
As a matter of fact, it was.

945
01:27:41,640 --> 01:27:44,234
( Music playing )

946
01:28:26,159 --> 01:28:29,311
