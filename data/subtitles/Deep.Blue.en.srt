1
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,930
Our planet is a Blue Planet,

2
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,850
deep blue water, dwarfing
the patches of land we call Earth.

3
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:26,170
Deep Blue, the source of life itself.

4
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:26,370
Here, half a million albatross jostle for
space to breed

5
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:28,810
on a tiny island in the Southern Ocean.

6
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:07,690
After thousands of miles of searching,

7
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,930
at last the Deep Blue offers its bounty.

8
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:37,090
The ocean sustains far more life than
all of the land,

9
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:42,650
but it is unevenly spread,
hiding and shifting in blue space.

10
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:05,050
Gathering sea birds betray a discovery.

11
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:08,890
The fish shoals have broken their cover.

12
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,210
This is a world of constant jeopardy,

13
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:28,170
an endless cycle of birth,
death and renewal.

14
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:55,810
For a new generation of sea lions,
life begins at the coast,

15
00:10:56,010 --> 00:11:00,250
a place of safety, to which their mothers
return only to give birth.

16
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:25,330
The unfamiliar land becomes
a gentle nursery,

17
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:27,930
a place where the young pups
gather strength,

18
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:31,290
as they grow in readiness
for a harsher life at sea.

19
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:47,250
The killer whales have only a few days
to take advantage of the naive young pups,

20
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:51,210
soon the sea lions will learn to avoid
the shallows at high tide.

21
00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:56,330
Meanwhile, the whales risk
being stranded on the shore

22
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,050
as they take their prey.

23
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:14,770
It's a dangerous business

24
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:17,570
and young killers must be taught
to hunt in open water

25
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:19,570
before they can risk the shore.

26
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:54,090
At the coastline the earth and sea
meet to form a borderland,

27
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:57,690
a world of tension where moods shift
with the tides.

28
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:32,010
Away from the coastline,
in bright warm water,

29
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:35,850
a tiny portion of the ocean holds
its greatest riches,

30
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,090
the coral reefs,

31
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:42,770
a narrow band of sun fed life

32
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:46,090
only found in the shallows
of the tropical seas.

33
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,970
This is a fragile world,

34
00:20:30,410 --> 00:20:34,210
built upon the smallest of organisms,
the coral polyps,

35
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,490
whose skeletons form the reef,

36
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:40,170
colonies that may stretch
for hundreds of miles.

37
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:20,930
A gentle whale shark,
the largest fish in the sea,

38
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:24,250
visits the reef during the green
of a plankton bloom,

39
00:22:24,690 --> 00:22:27,210
sifting the water through its gills.

40
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:15,050
The moon is a powerful force
upon the deep,

41
00:23:15,570 --> 00:23:20,490
her ghostly realm is a different world,
where new rules apply.

42
00:24:03,730 --> 00:24:08,330
Rooted to the spot, even the coral
must fight a war for territory,

43
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:14,010
shooting out deadly stinging cells to paralyse
and then eat their neighbours alive.

44
00:24:52,530 --> 00:24:56,290
The darkness brings its own mood,
a change of rhythm

45
00:24:56,570 --> 00:25:00,050
where the creatures of
the light must find a hiding place.

46
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:18,250
A crevice under a coral head
will provide shelter for the night,

47
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:21,290
but no certainty that you will see the dawn.

48
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:27,850
For others the darkness is feeding time.

49
00:26:09,170 --> 00:26:11,570
The night feeders have no need of light,

50
00:26:11,850 --> 00:26:15,450
special senses allow them
to detect the slightest movement.

51
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:22,490
Even the smallest electrical twitch of muscle
will bring them close,

52
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,690
ready to choose their victim.

53
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:36,050
Storm and rain and wind and cloud

54
00:30:36,170 --> 00:30:38,810
churn the seas with their own power.

55
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:02,290
The violent mixing of the waters brings life.

56
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:05,850
Awakened and fuelled by light from the sun.

57
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:13,250
Underwater currents mix and blend
the liquid world,

58
00:32:13,370 --> 00:32:16,650
whipping up the nourishing swarms of
tiny organisms

59
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:19,250
on which so many other animals feed.

60
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:26,690
The boneless creatures have
their place too,

61
00:34:27,090 --> 00:34:30,330
trailing their tentacles
behind their pulsing forms,

62
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,290
capturing their own prey as they drift.

63
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:02,490
At the ends of the earth, North and South,

64
00:39:02,650 --> 00:39:06,090
the frozen oceans wait for
the return of the sun,

65
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:09,770
the force that draws life from the still waters.

66
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:12,690
Polar bears, no longer safe on firm ice,
are forced to take to the water.

67
00:41:01,090 --> 00:41:06,330
In the far south, emperor penguins gather
in vast numbers at the ice edge.

68
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:11,530
They are sleek and fat, ready to face
the harshest weather conditions on Earth.

69
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:40,610
As the Antarctic summer ends,

70
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:45,130
almost all life heads to the north,
away from the freezing waters,

71
00:42:45,250 --> 00:42:48,090
but still the emperor penguins remain.

72
00:42:56,210 --> 00:42:58,890
They face a long and arduous journey south,

73
00:42:59,210 --> 00:43:03,330
one hundred miles across
the frozen wasteland to breed.

74
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:13,730
For three months the male birds will starve,

75
00:43:13,810 --> 00:43:19,370
enduring temperatures of minus 70 degrees,
and 100 mile an hour winds.

76
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:04,650
In the Arctic, winter turns liquid sea
to solid ground

77
00:44:04,890 --> 00:44:07,810
and for the first time
since summer melted the ice,

78
00:44:07,890 --> 00:44:11,210
the polar bears can move
across the ocean with ease.

79
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:19,410
After months of near starvation
the bears are on a desperate search for food,

80
00:44:19,730 --> 00:44:22,530
and a new generation must learn to hunt.

81
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:32,290
They scour their frozen world for signs of
nesting seals hidden in ice caves.

82
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:39,290
The freezing sea brings danger
as well as opportunity.

83
00:45:39,690 --> 00:45:44,330
Locked under a sheet of winter ice,
these beluga whales are trapped.

84
00:45:44,890 --> 00:45:47,330
It will be many weeks
before the ice opens up,

85
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:49,650
and they can swim to clear water.

86
00:45:57,650 --> 00:46:01,770
For now they are forced to share
this tiny breathing space,

87
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:06,090
surfacing to snatch air and
battling to keep the ice away.

88
00:48:10,090 --> 00:48:12,290
This time, the bear fails,

89
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:15,370
but the belugas will keep the scars
of the hunter's claws

90
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:18,010
on their arching streamlined backs.

91
00:48:25,530 --> 00:48:27,690
Those who survive their icy prison

92
00:48:27,770 --> 00:48:31,170
will eventually return to the freedom of
the open seas.

93
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:25,130
The warming sun once again
chases away the ice,

94
00:49:25,450 --> 00:49:30,730
and grey whales travel six thousand miles
to gorge in the polar seas.

95
00:49:48,290 --> 00:49:51,770
This three month old baby is
new to the open sea

96
00:49:51,970 --> 00:49:54,130
and the mother grey whale must
swim slowly

97
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:56,610
as she guides it to the feeding grounds.

98
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:36,130
Wary of the thirty tonne mother,
who is twice their size,

99
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:38,890
the hunters target the vulnerable calf.

100
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:47,170
After hours of harrying by the killers,
the baby whale is exhausted.

101
00:51:50,330 --> 00:51:52,970
Now, the hunters try to push him away
from the mother.

102
00:52:03,610 --> 00:52:05,210
They try to drown him.

103
00:53:43,170 --> 00:53:44,730
The calf is dead.

104
00:53:47,450 --> 00:53:52,410
Six hours after the chase began,
the killers finally have their prize.

105
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:05,130
The mother, bereft of the baby
she carried in her womb for thirteen months,

106
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:07,810
must continue her journey alone.

107
00:54:29,130 --> 00:54:33,970
The killers have taken only the tongue
and lower jaw of the baby whale.

108
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:13,290
Away from all land, the Open Ocean,

109
00:55:13,690 --> 00:55:18,890
an endless expanse of blue,
a vast watery desert.

110
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:28,450
Here, wandering giants

111
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:33,490
travel thousands of miles on
the oceanic currents in search of food.

112
00:57:24,090 --> 00:57:27,330
A lonely traveller in liquid space.

113
00:57:58,850 --> 00:58:01,730
In just a few secret places in the Blue,

114
00:58:02,450 --> 00:58:07,210
normally solitary wanderers come together
in great gatherings.

115
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:58,770
Amid the fury, a thirty tonne giant
rises from the blue.

116
01:04:12,570 --> 01:04:16,890
Leave the narrow strip of rich sunlit waters
of the ocean's surface

117
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:20,290
and journey downwards
into perpetual night.

118
01:04:39,130 --> 01:04:42,090
With each sinking metre pressure builds,

119
01:04:42,410 --> 01:04:47,210
the temperature falls,
all light from the surface fades.

120
01:04:52,050 --> 01:04:54,130
More men have been into space

121
01:04:54,370 --> 01:04:57,970
than have visited the deepest reaches
of this alien world.

122
01:08:01,250 --> 01:08:06,170
Go deeper and life under
pressure adapts, changes...

123
01:08:06,530 --> 01:08:09,450
ready to play a deadly game of
hide and seek.

124
01:09:02,090 --> 01:09:07,010
Down here the only light comes from
the inhabitants of the deep themselves,

125
01:09:07,530 --> 01:09:10,330
some use it as a lure to attract prey.

126
01:09:24,650 --> 01:09:27,290
For others, the light is a decoy,

127
01:09:27,530 --> 01:09:31,170
flashes which dazzle and confuse
their hunters.

128
01:10:41,730 --> 01:10:45,570
The deep ocean floor is by far
the largest habitat on Earth,

129
01:10:45,930 --> 01:10:48,410
covering more than half of all the sea bed.

130
01:10:48,810 --> 01:10:52,970
Here, the pressure is five hundred times
greater than at the surface.

131
01:11:01,930 --> 01:11:06,170
It is mostly flat, but here and there
it's scarred by massive wounds.

132
01:11:09,290 --> 01:11:12,210
The ocean's deepest reach,
The Mariana Trench,

133
01:11:12,330 --> 01:11:15,850
plummets seven miles down
towards the Earth's core.

134
01:11:39,370 --> 01:11:43,650
The mid ocean ridges are the largest
geological structures on Earth.

135
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:53,810
They stretch thirty thousand miles.

136
01:13:01,250 --> 01:13:04,570
Water, hot as molten lead, gushes
from chimneys

137
01:13:04,650 --> 01:13:07,410
as high as sixteen storey buildings.

138
01:13:15,330 --> 01:13:17,010
The black smokers.

139
01:13:17,770 --> 01:13:21,450
Highly poisonous hydrogen sulphide
billows into the water,

140
01:13:21,610 --> 01:13:24,010
creating biological hell.

141
01:13:41,130 --> 01:13:46,530
And yet, even here there is life
in enormous quantities.

142
01:13:56,010 --> 01:14:00,370
These chimneys are some of the most
densely inhabited spots on earth,

143
01:14:01,450 --> 01:14:05,570
pillars of life where animals exist
without energy from the sun.

144
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:12,450
Every single night, life without number
emerges from the Deep.

145
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:15,450
They come to feed in
the rich surface waters,

146
01:15:15,690 --> 01:15:20,210
a daily ritual which is the greatest
biological migration on the planet.

147
01:17:24,650 --> 01:17:27,890
We have sought out the stars,
and our moon,

148
01:17:28,130 --> 01:17:30,130
without getting to know the Deep.

149
01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:34,250
Yet, it is the Ocean that continues to
surprise us.

150
01:20:55,210 --> 01:20:59,050
So far, we have explored only
a tiny fraction of the Deep,

151
01:20:59,530 --> 01:21:02,690
home to the largest creature
that has ever existed.

152
01:21:19,370 --> 01:21:23,330
There were once three hundred thousand
blue whales in our oceans.

153
01:21:26,570 --> 01:21:31,090
Now, just one percent of
these glorious animals remain...

154
01:21:35,570 --> 01:21:38,890
and yet we continue to plunder her
secret world.
