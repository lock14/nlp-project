1
00:00:52,151 --> 00:00:54,711
You look good with
a big nose, actually.

2
00:00:54,754 --> 00:00:58,053
You could become a great
classical actor

3
00:00:58,090 --> 00:00:59,921
and be taken seriously.

4
00:01:03,062 --> 00:01:05,189
I got a little crevice,
can you see that there?

5
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:07,665
See?

6
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:10,328
- Yes.
- That's fizzy drinks.

7
00:01:10,369 --> 00:01:13,236
- Yeah.
- And I don't think the color is great.

8
00:01:13,272 --> 00:01:15,467
What do you think?
Have a look at the color.

9
00:01:15,508 --> 00:01:18,341
I saw the color
last time I looked.

10
00:01:18,377 --> 00:01:20,072
It registered.

11
00:01:20,112 --> 00:01:22,478
It's what I'd call
"not white."

12
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:24,449
- Well...
- What color would you call it?

13
00:01:24,483 --> 00:01:27,111
I would... I'd concur
with "not white."

14
00:01:27,153 --> 00:01:29,121
I'd go further.

15
00:01:29,155 --> 00:01:31,123
I mean,
it's not yellow.

16
00:01:31,157 --> 00:01:33,455
I, you know...

17
00:01:33,492 --> 00:01:35,517
it's a sliding scale,
isn't it, you know.

18
00:01:35,561 --> 00:01:38,724
- Yeah.
- I think you're...

19
00:01:38,764 --> 00:01:40,459
- you're a...
- Hint of yellow.

20
00:01:40,499 --> 00:01:43,127
- Closest to...
- Barley meadow.

21
00:01:44,503 --> 00:01:47,700
- If you wanna give it...
- Tuscan sunset?

22
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,503
If you want...

23
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:53,074
You're getting laughs

24
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:55,342
but it's not making
your teeth look any better.

25
00:01:55,381 --> 00:01:57,372
No, you know, so...

26
00:02:00,219 --> 00:02:02,278
Pub ceiling?

27
00:02:02,321 --> 00:02:04,312
The elephant man.

28
00:02:06,158 --> 00:02:07,955
Mmm.

29
00:02:07,993 --> 00:02:09,585
I think if your teeth
are too good,

30
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:11,596
you get bogged down
in the leading-man thing,

31
00:02:11,630 --> 00:02:13,427
and I don't want
that to happen.

32
00:02:13,466 --> 00:02:17,027
I think you can
sleep easy at night...

33
00:02:20,105 --> 00:02:22,801
about the prospect
of being cast as a leading man.

34
00:02:25,611 --> 00:02:28,444
Now I haven't got any teeth
at all there on the bottom.

35
00:02:30,216 --> 00:02:32,184
Thanks for that.

36
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:34,083
That was pleasant.

37
00:02:34,119 --> 00:02:36,553
Have another look.
Do they still look that color?

38
00:02:36,589 --> 00:02:38,318
- It's okay...
- Let yourself adjust...

39
00:02:38,357 --> 00:02:40,348
It's seared
on my retina.

40
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,485
I think once people
get used to them,

41
00:02:43,529 --> 00:02:46,555
you actually...
actually, it's a nice color.

42
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,432
I think you could decorate a child's
nursery in this color.

43
00:02:49,468 --> 00:02:53,131
Quite soothing.

44
00:02:53,172 --> 00:02:56,801
But you could have saved them a few bob
If you'd been cast as Dr. Slop.

45
00:02:56,842 --> 00:02:59,333
Yeah, but that's very
much a supporting role.

46
00:03:02,414 --> 00:03:05,941
- This is...
- Yeah, and? The point being?

47
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:07,976
This is a co-lead.

48
00:03:09,655 --> 00:03:12,681
Well, we'll see after
the edit, shall we?

49
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:14,716
Do you not think so?

50
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:18,361
Featured co-lead?

51
00:03:18,397 --> 00:03:20,024
It's not a cameo.

52
00:03:20,065 --> 00:03:22,226
It's not a cameo, no.

53
00:03:22,268 --> 00:03:23,929
It's a supporting role.

54
00:03:23,969 --> 00:03:26,802
It's not a supporting role.
I mean, all the way through.

55
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,936
Yeah.

56
00:03:29,975 --> 00:03:33,502
It's a co. It's a co,
it's an "and Rob Brydon."

57
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:35,411
- It's us.
- It's not an under.

58
00:03:35,447 --> 00:03:37,074
It's Steve Coogan,
Rob Brydon.

59
00:03:37,116 --> 00:03:38,913
In fact, if we went
alphabetically,

60
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:40,543
which I think is
the only fair way,

61
00:03:40,586 --> 00:03:42,315
it would be Rob Brydon,
Steve Coogan.

62
00:03:42,354 --> 00:03:44,219
Yeah, but that would
just be ridiculous.

63
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:15,477
Ahem...

64
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:17,853
Groucho Marx once said

65
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:20,723
that the trouble with writing a book
about yourself

66
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:23,387
is you can't
fool around.

67
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:26,296
Why not? People fool around
with themselves all the time.

68
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:32,429
I'm Tristram Shandy,

69
00:04:32,471 --> 00:04:34,735
the main character
in this story,

70
00:04:34,773 --> 00:04:36,741
the leading role.

71
00:04:39,979 --> 00:04:43,107
Susannah!
Susannah!

72
00:04:44,316 --> 00:04:46,181
Susannah!

73
00:04:46,218 --> 00:04:47,913
There are those who say

74
00:04:47,953 --> 00:04:49,318
this is
a cock and bull story.

75
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,687
That's the bull,

76
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,316
my father's bull,

77
00:04:53,359 --> 00:04:55,725
and I'll show you
the cock in a minute.

78
00:05:02,001 --> 00:05:03,992
Susannah!

79
00:05:05,738 --> 00:05:07,729
Susannah!

80
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:14,571
- Is it started?
- Yes.

81
00:05:14,613 --> 00:05:17,912
- Yes, l... I think it is.
- Oh ma'am!

82
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:21,980
- Shall I fetch the midwife?
- Yes.

83
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:33,192
These two gentlemen are my Uncle Toby
and Corporal Trim.

84
00:05:33,232 --> 00:05:35,496
They're recreating
the Battle of Namur

85
00:05:35,534 --> 00:05:37,126
where they both fought.

86
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,307
Get them forward!

87
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:49,542
Colonel Ingoldsby's orders, sir.
The flag is to advance

88
00:05:49,581 --> 00:05:51,640
to the ditch
behind the 50-pounder.

89
00:05:51,684 --> 00:05:53,208
What?! The ditch?

90
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:55,277
There's no such thing
as a ditch out there.

91
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,254
The ditch behind
the 50-pounder, sir!

92
00:05:57,289 --> 00:05:59,883
That is a ravelin.
A ravelin.

93
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:01,586
A farmer
digs a ditch!

94
00:06:01,627 --> 00:06:03,857
- And so...
- Sir, get down!

95
00:06:11,303 --> 00:06:13,771
When I said this was
a cock and bull story,

96
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:17,674
it was my cock
I was talking about,

97
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:19,701
not Uncle Toby's.

98
00:06:19,745 --> 00:06:23,237
After all, am I not
the hero of my own life?

99
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:25,443
- Where's my chamber-pot?
- Master Tristram, where is it?

100
00:06:25,484 --> 00:06:27,679
What have you done with it?
Is it hidden under the bed?

101
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,881
- Where is it?
- You'll have to let out of the window...

102
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,412
I need to pee!

103
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:33,448
Lift your
nightshirt up.

104
00:06:35,894 --> 00:06:38,226
Poke your little pecker
out the window.

105
00:06:38,263 --> 00:06:41,323
Do you think the time might come
when you don't make much of a fuss

106
00:06:41,366 --> 00:06:43,061
about passing
your water? That's it.

107
00:06:52,644 --> 00:06:56,239
That is a child actor
pretending to be me.

108
00:06:56,281 --> 00:06:58,249
I'll be able to
play myself later.

109
00:06:58,283 --> 00:07:01,184
I think I could probably
get away with being...

110
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:03,245
18, 19?

111
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:06,815
Until then, I'll be played by
a series of child actors.

112
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,759
This was the best
of a bad bunch.

113
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:11,763
He's unable to convey
the pain or shock

114
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:13,788
of such an event.

115
00:07:17,803 --> 00:07:19,430
I think I can.

116
00:07:19,471 --> 00:07:22,634
Susannah said I was doing it
exactly how you did it.

117
00:07:22,674 --> 00:07:24,869
It may be
the same noise,

118
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,605
but it doesn't
have the emotion.

119
00:07:26,645 --> 00:07:29,341
Go on, then.
Show me how to do it.

120
00:07:38,857 --> 00:07:41,018
I was doing it
with a comedy,

121
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:43,357
not a pantomime.

122
00:07:45,364 --> 00:07:47,264
Master Tristram!

123
00:07:47,299 --> 00:07:50,632
Come here, let me
fix it all better.

124
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:53,331
Just about murdered you.

125
00:07:55,974 --> 00:07:57,771
Oh my darling.

126
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:00,278
My dear darling.

127
00:08:00,312 --> 00:08:02,371
Yes, there...

128
00:08:02,414 --> 00:08:03,938
there, what happened?

129
00:08:03,982 --> 00:08:07,850
This is my beautiful,
lovely mother

130
00:08:07,886 --> 00:08:10,047
Elizabeth.

131
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:12,181
How did this happen?

132
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:14,988
It was my fault.
I removed the weights

133
00:08:15,027 --> 00:08:16,722
- from the sash window...
- What?

134
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:20,129
At Mr. Toby's request to make
mortars for the Siege of Namur.

135
00:08:20,165 --> 00:08:23,396
I wish now with all my heart
I had cut off something else.

136
00:08:28,273 --> 00:08:30,173
My poor little Tristram.

137
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:39,284
So both my uncle
and myself were victims

138
00:08:39,318 --> 00:08:41,047
of the Battle of Namur

139
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:43,350
even though it took place
years before my birth.

140
00:08:44,356 --> 00:08:47,325
I was not unmanned,
by the way.

141
00:08:47,359 --> 00:08:49,691
I was circumcised
like a lot of men...

142
00:08:49,728 --> 00:08:51,195
manly men.

143
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,198
I can't speak
for my uncle in that area,

144
00:08:53,232 --> 00:08:55,632
although even as a boy
I was curious.

145
00:08:55,667 --> 00:08:58,693
Sir, where were you
injured during battle?

146
00:08:58,737 --> 00:09:01,501
- This stretch of wall...
- This one looks quite like me.

147
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,599
The front of the curtain
is the breast.

148
00:09:03,642 --> 00:09:06,406
- None of the men...
- There's a ravelin below this fosse.

149
00:09:06,445 --> 00:09:09,937
- I shall dig it now, sir.
- There was indeed, Corporal, yes.

150
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:13,884
I tumbled into it just... in the course
of the afternoon.

151
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,944
Where exactly
were you injured?

152
00:09:15,988 --> 00:09:17,956
I will show you
the exact spot.

153
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,651
Soldier, quick march.

154
00:09:22,661 --> 00:09:25,152
I received my injury
at nine of the clock

155
00:09:25,197 --> 00:09:26,721
- just here.
- In the...

156
00:09:26,765 --> 00:09:28,790
in the ditch.

157
00:09:28,834 --> 00:09:31,098
I'm getting ahead of myself.

158
00:09:31,136 --> 00:09:33,127
I am not yet born.

159
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:39,275
Mrs. Shandy's
took bad, sir,

160
00:09:39,311 --> 00:09:41,142
with the pangs, sir.

161
00:09:41,179 --> 00:09:43,943
They're coming thick and fast.
On my way to fetch midwife.

162
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:51,212
- She's doing badly?
- Yes, sir.

163
00:09:51,256 --> 00:09:53,383
With the pangs.

164
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:56,986
When I was born, my father was
four years older than I am now.

165
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:58,963
So, given the family
resemblance,

166
00:09:58,997 --> 00:10:00,692
I thought I should
portray him

167
00:10:00,732 --> 00:10:02,529
as well as myself.

168
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:05,058
Walter! Brother Walter!

169
00:10:06,371 --> 00:10:09,397
Brother, Elizabeth
isn't well, Brother.

170
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:12,569
- She's suffering from pangs.
- Pangs?

171
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:15,273
I believe she was referring
to the birth pangs, sir.

172
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:16,838
She's gone
to fetch the midwife

173
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,782
- and fast...
- The midwife?

174
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:20,751
No no no no.

175
00:10:20,786 --> 00:10:23,346
Obadiah!
Obadiah!

176
00:10:23,388 --> 00:10:26,619
I want you to ride like the devil
to Dr. Slop's

177
00:10:26,658 --> 00:10:28,683
and tell him my wife
has fallen into labor

178
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:30,524
and I desire him
to come immediately.

179
00:10:30,562 --> 00:10:32,962
I will not have
the midwife deliver my son.

180
00:10:36,001 --> 00:10:38,663
Come on! Come on!
Get up!

181
00:10:45,877 --> 00:10:48,812
You may find it surprising
that the method of my birth

182
00:10:48,847 --> 00:10:51,281
had yet to be decided.

183
00:10:51,316 --> 00:10:54,877
The cause was not too little planning,
but too much.

184
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:58,219
"I, Walter Shandy, undertake to arrange
for any confinement

185
00:10:58,256 --> 00:11:00,224
of Elizabeth Shandy
in London,

186
00:11:00,258 --> 00:11:02,590
and further undertake
to pay all expenses

187
00:11:02,627 --> 00:11:05,061
arising from
that confinement."

188
00:11:05,097 --> 00:11:06,894
Hmm.

189
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:08,729
What is the smaller
writing here?

190
00:11:08,767 --> 00:11:11,497
That's just small print.
You always get that.

191
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,335
This is the beginning
of all my woes.

192
00:11:15,374 --> 00:11:18,070
I should have to
stay in Yorkshire?

193
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,010
Yes, only if you once

194
00:11:20,045 --> 00:11:22,377
already made the journey
to London by mistake.

195
00:11:26,685 --> 00:11:29,210
In the September
before my birth

196
00:11:29,254 --> 00:11:31,484
my mother, being pregnant...
or so she thought...

197
00:11:31,523 --> 00:11:33,423
insisted my father
take her to London.

198
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,393
- You all right, my love?
- I'm fairly comfortable.

199
00:11:37,562 --> 00:11:39,621
Not long now.

200
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:41,928
Just another two days.

201
00:11:46,605 --> 00:11:49,233
Tell me, doctor, in your opinion,
is it a boy or a girl?

202
00:11:49,274 --> 00:11:51,606
I'm afraid, madam,
it is neither.

203
00:11:51,643 --> 00:11:54,134
It is a phantom only.

204
00:11:54,179 --> 00:11:56,147
How can that be?

205
00:11:56,181 --> 00:11:58,172
This happens more
than you can know.

206
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:06,816
£10.

207
00:12:06,858 --> 00:12:08,758
£10 to tell us

208
00:12:08,794 --> 00:12:11,786
that it's wind
that is inflating you.

209
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:21,196
Any other time of the year
would have been fine, but...

210
00:12:23,942 --> 00:12:26,035
all my plums
will be spoiled.

211
00:12:30,982 --> 00:12:33,849
It's not the expense
that bothers me,

212
00:12:33,885 --> 00:12:36,217
but the disappointment
of losing a child.

213
00:12:36,254 --> 00:12:38,882
Walter, I too
have lost a child!

214
00:12:45,497 --> 00:12:47,829
No matter, dear.

215
00:12:47,866 --> 00:12:50,334
Don't fret.
Please.

216
00:12:50,368 --> 00:12:53,599
Unfortunately, due to
the length and discomfort

217
00:12:53,638 --> 00:12:56,971
of the journey, by the time
they'd arrived back at Shandy Hall,

218
00:12:57,008 --> 00:12:59,909
my father had decided
to implement the small print...

219
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:01,913
"The next birth
shall be at home."

220
00:13:03,448 --> 00:13:06,110
It is infuriating

221
00:13:06,151 --> 00:13:08,847
that Elizabeth
has this humor to...

222
00:13:08,887 --> 00:13:11,788
entrust the life
of our child

223
00:13:11,823 --> 00:13:15,088
to an ignorant old woman
when the admirable Dr. Slop

224
00:13:15,127 --> 00:13:17,561
with all his
modern instruments

225
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:20,030
is so readily at hand.

226
00:13:20,065 --> 00:13:22,192
Perhaps she does not
care to let a man

227
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:25,897
that close to her,
um...

228
00:13:25,937 --> 00:13:28,269
Her what?
Say it, man.

229
00:13:33,445 --> 00:13:36,141
By heavens, what's that?
Do you think she's to lay an egg?

230
00:13:36,181 --> 00:13:37,944
You know nothing
of women at all.

231
00:13:40,318 --> 00:13:41,979
Nothing at all.

232
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:44,045
No matter.
The point is Slop does.

233
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:45,556
He knows them
inside out.

234
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,387
He has a fine
brass instrum...

235
00:13:47,425 --> 00:13:48,687
Obadiah, you were quick.

236
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:51,560
- Fortune favored us.
- Dr. Slop.

237
00:13:51,596 --> 00:13:53,496
I only came to borrow
some pipe tobacco.

238
00:14:07,445 --> 00:14:09,470
Dr. Slop!

239
00:14:11,149 --> 00:14:13,344
Where the devil are you
going at such a rate?!

240
00:14:13,385 --> 00:14:14,943
To fetch you, sir.

241
00:14:17,722 --> 00:14:20,714
I was telling my brother about your
fine brass instrument,

242
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:22,886
the one
with the hinge.

243
00:14:22,928 --> 00:14:25,362
It was new invented.
It's called...

244
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:28,389
- Forceps.
- Aye, the forceps.

245
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:30,298
I like the look
of those.

246
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:33,702
The forceps, they're in a bag
hanging off my bed-head.

247
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,501
I could...

248
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:40,636
No no, it must
be done properly.

249
00:14:41,947 --> 00:14:44,108
Obadiah!
Obadiah!

250
00:14:46,418 --> 00:14:48,648
I'll give thee a crown
if thou dost hasten.

251
00:14:48,687 --> 00:14:50,052
Thank you, sir!

252
00:14:50,088 --> 00:14:52,318
And I, another!

253
00:14:52,357 --> 00:14:53,949
Susannah!

254
00:14:57,229 --> 00:15:00,096
- Will you take a pipe, Doctor?
- I will.

255
00:15:00,131 --> 00:15:02,122
I'd say we had...

256
00:15:02,167 --> 00:15:04,658
a good deal of piping
at Flanders, Doctor.

257
00:15:07,872 --> 00:15:10,898
Come on!

258
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:12,534
I meant a pipe to smoke?

259
00:15:12,577 --> 00:15:15,273
Well, if it's smoke
you're after,

260
00:15:15,313 --> 00:15:17,281
then Flanders
was the place...

261
00:15:17,315 --> 00:15:18,942
at the Battle of Namur

262
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:21,248
- when the cannons were set off.
- Loosed.

263
00:15:21,286 --> 00:15:24,483
"Loosed" is the proper word,
Trim, yes.

264
00:15:31,096 --> 00:15:34,259
Dr. Slop, allow me
to show you a map...

265
00:15:34,299 --> 00:15:36,563
...of such detail

266
00:15:36,601 --> 00:15:40,332
and artistry as to make
a man's eyes water.

267
00:15:42,407 --> 00:15:44,102
I'm here, I'm here.

268
00:15:44,142 --> 00:15:47,703
Here, the City of...
come, Doctor, come...

269
00:15:47,746 --> 00:15:49,737
the City of Namur
as it appeared

270
00:15:49,781 --> 00:15:52,147
to the besieging forces
that morning in 1695.

271
00:15:52,183 --> 00:15:53,980
The English
and the Scots

272
00:15:54,019 --> 00:15:56,249
under the command
of General Ramsey

273
00:15:56,288 --> 00:15:58,552
were positioned
in the trenches to the right.

274
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:00,490
Now the dilemma
for the good general was...

275
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:01,992
which way forward?

276
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,222
There were many directions
to choose from.

277
00:16:04,262 --> 00:16:06,992
It is my humble opinion
that he chose the best direction.

278
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:14,464
No, Brother, what happened
that day to you?

279
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:17,339
Is everything
all right?

280
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,309
You know...
down there.

281
00:16:22,847 --> 00:16:25,338
Almost there, sir.

282
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,117
Where does it hurt?
Where were you hit?

283
00:16:32,157 --> 00:16:34,591
Sir.

284
00:16:34,626 --> 00:16:36,253
This man's
lost his mind.

285
00:16:36,294 --> 00:16:38,728
I think the injury
may be in a delicate place, sir,

286
00:16:38,763 --> 00:16:40,697
which my master is
too modest to mention.

287
00:16:40,732 --> 00:16:42,723
Damn.

288
00:16:42,767 --> 00:16:45,463
Can a man be too delicate
too name his own privates

289
00:16:45,503 --> 00:16:47,733
yet strong enough
to fight a war?

290
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:50,704
I shall have you
sent home, sir.

291
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,220
Unless this Obadiah
makes haste,

292
00:17:04,255 --> 00:17:06,280
the thing will befall
us without forceps.

293
00:17:08,126 --> 00:17:09,753
Here he is!

294
00:17:09,794 --> 00:17:11,523
Well done,
sir, well done.

295
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,087
Good man.

296
00:17:16,267 --> 00:17:18,201
A knife, have you a knife?

297
00:17:18,236 --> 00:17:20,136
I have a knife.

298
00:17:20,171 --> 00:17:21,763
Use your teeth,
Dr. Slop.

299
00:17:21,806 --> 00:17:25,401
Your teeth...
oh well.

300
00:17:29,047 --> 00:17:30,912
Ow, my finger!

301
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:33,349
Now this, Dr. Slop,
is a book

302
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,717
- in which there is a fine engraving...
- I don't want to see

303
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,348
your armies
at Flanders or anywhere,

304
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:40,790
and if I get my hands
on the blockhead

305
00:17:40,825 --> 00:17:43,259
who tied
these blasted knots,

306
00:17:43,294 --> 00:17:45,592
I'll kick him all the way
to bloody Flanders.

307
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,600
I have a book...

308
00:17:50,635 --> 00:17:52,569
"Colorful Words
for All Occasions."

309
00:17:52,604 --> 00:17:55,129
- Let me...
- I've got you, ma'am.

310
00:17:55,173 --> 00:17:57,471
Now, on cutting the thumb or finger
with the pen-knife.

311
00:17:57,509 --> 00:18:00,000
- There we go, the very word.
- No, I don't want...

312
00:18:04,816 --> 00:18:06,943
by the authority
of God Almighty,

313
00:18:06,985 --> 00:18:09,283
the Father,
Son and Holy Ghost,

314
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,810
and of all Holy Canons,

315
00:18:10,855 --> 00:18:12,618
and of the undefiled
Virgin Mary,

316
00:18:12,657 --> 00:18:15,182
- mother of Our Savior...
- May he be damned.

317
00:18:15,226 --> 00:18:17,524
I'll go fetch
Dr. Slop.

318
00:18:17,562 --> 00:18:20,861
No! No! No!

319
00:18:20,899 --> 00:18:23,993
"Unless he repent him
of tying such knots,

320
00:18:24,035 --> 00:18:26,128
may he be cursed
in his eye,

321
00:18:26,171 --> 00:18:28,503
in his mouth, in his heart,
in his stomach,

322
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,770
- may he be cursed..."
- Doctor, midwife is here.

323
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,141
The midwife is here.

324
00:18:33,178 --> 00:18:35,806
And she's bruised the upper part
of her thigh, here.

325
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:37,474
I'll come
and look at it.

326
00:18:37,515 --> 00:18:39,244
You'd better look
into my mistress.

327
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:42,845
You're not fixin' to
use them on the little child?

328
00:18:42,887 --> 00:18:45,219
Yes, this is
the very latest.

329
00:18:45,256 --> 00:18:47,281
With these...

330
00:18:47,325 --> 00:18:48,883
I can extrude
the baby's head

331
00:18:48,927 --> 00:18:51,987
before the mother has a chance
to mash its head to dough.

332
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,998
I can show you.
Captain Shandy,

333
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:55,966
make a baby's head
of your hands.

334
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,991
You're to imagine
these sleeves

335
00:18:58,036 --> 00:18:59,765
are Mrs. Shandy's...

336
00:18:59,804 --> 00:19:01,465
funnel.

337
00:19:01,506 --> 00:19:03,804
- Funnel?
- Meat curtains.

338
00:19:03,842 --> 00:19:05,776
Meat curtain?
Brother?

339
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,244
My brother knows
nothing of women.

340
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:11,271
I insert
the forceps thus,

341
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,114
gently enclosing
the baby's head, you see?

342
00:19:14,152 --> 00:19:17,280
And then
I gently... tug it!

343
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:19,984
Ooh! Agh!

344
00:19:20,024 --> 00:19:22,288
Brother!
By my honor,

345
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,318
Dr. Slop has taken
the skin clean

346
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:26,091
off the back
of my hand, man,

347
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:27,927
with your... forceps!

348
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:31,231
You've crushed my knuckles
to a jelly in the bargain.

349
00:19:31,269 --> 00:19:33,294
Lucky it's not
the baby's head.

350
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,830
A baby's head is naturally as soft
as a path of melon.

351
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:38,706
It's but a scratch.

352
00:19:38,743 --> 00:19:40,574
- Trim, fetch a melon. Run!
- Yes, sir.

353
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,341
Nothing like
a baby's head.

354
00:19:42,380 --> 00:19:44,177
- Nothing like one.
- Entirely different.

355
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,022
- Melon.
- Thank you, Trim.

356
00:19:55,059 --> 00:19:57,118
Baby's head!

357
00:19:57,161 --> 00:19:59,391
This is a much more
accurate representation.

358
00:19:59,430 --> 00:20:02,297
- Funnel.
- Funnel?

359
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,267
All ready,
and then we merely...

360
00:20:07,071 --> 00:20:09,665
Had my father possessed
a more scientific mind,

361
00:20:09,707 --> 00:20:12,039
the tragedy of my nose

362
00:20:12,076 --> 00:20:13,668
could have
been avoided,

363
00:20:13,711 --> 00:20:15,906
but he was of
a more philosophical bent,

364
00:20:15,947 --> 00:20:18,438
used to arguing
from first principles.

365
00:20:18,483 --> 00:20:20,474
So eventually
when I was born,

366
00:20:20,518 --> 00:20:22,110
I was delivered
with the very forceps

367
00:20:22,153 --> 00:20:24,053
that had crushed
the path of the melon.

368
00:20:35,266 --> 00:20:37,427
The baby's born.
You have a son.

369
00:20:39,237 --> 00:20:42,400
- Congratulations...
- I need something stiff...

370
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,170
but flexible
for a splint.

371
00:20:45,209 --> 00:20:48,110
- A quill, perhaps.
- Ooh, that'll do.

372
00:20:48,146 --> 00:20:49,875
What has happened
to my son?

373
00:20:49,914 --> 00:20:52,781
Doctor needs
to make a bridge.

374
00:20:52,817 --> 00:20:54,614
I'm not finished.
Susannah!

375
00:20:56,020 --> 00:20:58,113
Susannah!

376
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,886
- Doctor.
- Susannah.

377
00:21:00,925 --> 00:21:02,415
Hmm.

378
00:21:03,428 --> 00:21:05,157
What has happened
to my son?

379
00:21:05,196 --> 00:21:07,426
There was
a small mishap.

380
00:21:07,465 --> 00:21:09,399
A mishap with
the machinery.

381
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:12,096
- Machinery?
- It is the forceps.

382
00:21:12,136 --> 00:21:14,604
He has merely...

383
00:21:14,639 --> 00:21:17,369
broken his nose.

384
00:21:17,408 --> 00:21:20,002
It had ever been
my father's wish

385
00:21:20,044 --> 00:21:21,636
to have a son
with a big nose.

386
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,739
All the great men
of antiquity had big noses,

387
00:21:24,782 --> 00:21:27,182
a nose like
Caesar, Dante,

388
00:21:27,218 --> 00:21:29,686
Pythagoras,
Newton,

389
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,916
Alexander the Great.

390
00:21:31,956 --> 00:21:33,890
But I'm getting
ahead of myself.

391
00:21:35,126 --> 00:21:37,117
I am not yet born.

392
00:21:37,161 --> 00:21:38,685
I'll attend the lady.

393
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,220
No!

394
00:21:40,264 --> 00:21:41,788
Gee!

395
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,529
Deirdre, confound you!

396
00:21:45,703 --> 00:21:47,671
Don't you touch those!

397
00:21:47,705 --> 00:21:49,969
Get off!
Get... back!

398
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,976
My son is
not yet born

399
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,841
and already
I am exhausted.

400
00:21:55,146 --> 00:21:57,546
Should we go and see
the fortifications?

401
00:22:03,354 --> 00:22:05,117
Mrs. Shandy...

402
00:22:11,529 --> 00:22:13,360
Get on the bed.

403
00:22:14,432 --> 00:22:16,263
The bed, woman,
the bed.

404
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,996
There is nothing
more important...

405
00:22:19,037 --> 00:22:20,629
than the choice of name

406
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:22,367
in deciding
the future of a child.

407
00:22:22,407 --> 00:22:24,398
Four fingers,

408
00:22:24,442 --> 00:22:26,273
- She's four fingers dilated...
- Good.

409
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:30,041
The highest is Trismegistus
as in Hermes Trismegistus,

410
00:22:30,081 --> 00:22:33,778
the greatest philosopher,
the greatest law-giver,

411
00:22:33,818 --> 00:22:35,877
the greatest priest.

412
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,683
And he was an engineer.

413
00:22:37,722 --> 00:22:39,417
Then you should
call him that, then.

414
00:22:39,457 --> 00:22:41,982
The child should
be called Tristram.

415
00:22:42,026 --> 00:22:43,926
- Tristram, no.
- Tristram.

416
00:22:43,961 --> 00:22:47,488
No, Tristram's the worst.
Tristram is the dog's breath worst...

417
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,329
I know.

418
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:52,302
How did I come to be named Tristram
given my father's views?

419
00:22:52,336 --> 00:22:56,329
Well, even though my birth
is fast approaching,

420
00:22:56,374 --> 00:22:58,001
there's still
time to catch

421
00:22:58,042 --> 00:23:00,306
the tragedy
of my naming.

422
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:04,177
Sir, it's the baby.
It's the baby, sir.

423
00:23:04,215 --> 00:23:07,707
He is as black as night.
Black as my shoes, sir.

424
00:23:07,752 --> 00:23:10,084
There, he's as black
as my shoe.

425
00:23:10,121 --> 00:23:12,248
We might lose
the baby, sir.

426
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,349
The parson is here
and his horse.

427
00:23:14,392 --> 00:23:16,155
The baby
must be baptized.

428
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:17,991
- Yes. Hand me my britches, please.
- No.

429
00:23:18,029 --> 00:23:19,553
There's no time
to get dressed.

430
00:23:19,597 --> 00:23:22,498
My mistress wanted to know
if it should be named after Captain Toby

431
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:24,364
as he's the godfather.

432
00:23:24,402 --> 00:23:26,870
If my father had been sure
I was going to die,

433
00:23:26,904 --> 00:23:29,202
he would have complimented Toby
by naming me so,

434
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,401
thereby saving the name
of Trismegistus

435
00:23:31,442 --> 00:23:33,239
for one who
might survive.

436
00:23:33,277 --> 00:23:34,835
But he couldn't be sure.

437
00:23:34,879 --> 00:23:37,279
The name, sir,
the name, the name.

438
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,215
- Trismegistus.
- Trismegistus.

439
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,445
You're
a leaky vessel.

440
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:44,319
Can you carry it the length
of the corridor without spilling?

441
00:23:44,355 --> 00:23:46,789
Trismegistus,
Trismegistus,

442
00:23:46,824 --> 00:23:48,655
Tris...
Tristram Gistus,

443
00:23:48,693 --> 00:23:50,217
Tristram Gistus...

444
00:23:58,703 --> 00:24:00,193
Trisme...

445
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,672
- Tristram?
- No, it's not that, no.

446
00:24:02,707 --> 00:24:05,608
There is no Christian name
beginning "tris" but Tristram.

447
00:24:05,643 --> 00:24:07,372
No, it's not Tristram.

448
00:24:07,411 --> 00:24:08,878
It has some
"gistus" in it.

449
00:24:08,913 --> 00:24:10,778
Tristram Gistus?

450
00:24:10,815 --> 00:24:12,282
Tristram Gistus!

451
00:24:12,316 --> 00:24:13,908
There is no
"gistus" in it, dear.

452
00:24:13,951 --> 00:24:16,283
It is my name and a very
fine name it is, too.

453
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:19,653
I baptize you in the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

454
00:24:19,690 --> 00:24:21,954
Tristram Shandy.

455
00:24:21,993 --> 00:24:24,985
All is well. Little Tristram is
made right with God.

456
00:24:31,035 --> 00:24:33,560
"...Brethren,
this child is regenerate,

457
00:24:33,604 --> 00:24:35,936
grafted into the body
of Christ's Church.

458
00:24:35,973 --> 00:24:38,100
Let us give thanks
to Almighty God..."

459
00:24:43,681 --> 00:24:47,173
Look, ma'am.

460
00:24:47,218 --> 00:24:50,187
He is well.

461
00:24:50,221 --> 00:24:52,746
He's not
black anymore.

462
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:57,887
Ma'am, look.

463
00:24:57,929 --> 00:25:00,557
It's a miracle.

464
00:25:00,598 --> 00:25:02,088
You have not
forgotten the name.

465
00:25:02,133 --> 00:25:05,762
No, and the baby is well.

466
00:25:08,272 --> 00:25:12,140
My beautiful beautiful
Tristram Shandy.

467
00:25:12,176 --> 00:25:14,872
Tristram?

468
00:25:18,516 --> 00:25:21,576
My son has been cursed
from the moment of his conception.

469
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,286
Now, I forgot to mention this.

470
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:27,848
Well, it's not that I forgot.
It's more that I thought...

471
00:25:27,892 --> 00:25:30,417
I should save it until
we knew each other better.

472
00:25:30,461 --> 00:25:32,588
My father had
two domestic obligations

473
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:35,827
and being a systematic man,
he liked to dispense them both at once.

474
00:25:38,169 --> 00:25:40,660
The first was
to wind the clock.

475
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:43,173
The second
was more enjoyable.

476
00:25:43,207 --> 00:25:45,937
Walter!

477
00:25:49,113 --> 00:25:51,479
You may be familiar
with Locke's Theory

478
00:25:51,515 --> 00:25:53,278
of the Association
of Ideas.

479
00:25:53,317 --> 00:25:55,751
It's been updated since
by Pavlov and his dog.

480
00:25:57,455 --> 00:25:59,946
If the dog hears the metronome
when he's being fed,

481
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,926
the dog starts to associate
the metronome and food.

482
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,155
So in the end,
if he hears the metronome

483
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,061
even when
there's no food,

484
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:09,931
the dog starts
to salivate.

485
00:26:09,967 --> 00:26:13,562
A similar association of ideas
took root in my mother's head

486
00:26:13,604 --> 00:26:16,300
between one domestic
obligation and the other.

487
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,831
As soon as she heard
my father winding the clock,

488
00:26:18,876 --> 00:26:21,606
she began to salivate,
as it were.

489
00:26:24,415 --> 00:26:26,713
Of course, it works
the other way around too.

490
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:28,582
After a while,

491
00:26:28,619 --> 00:26:31,144
if you give the dog the food
without the metronome,

492
00:26:31,188 --> 00:26:32,951
the dog produces
no saliva.

493
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,720
So on the occasion
my father came home

494
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,285
and was feeling so keen
to dispense one obligation

495
00:26:38,329 --> 00:26:42,129
he skipped the other,
he surprised my mother...

496
00:26:42,166 --> 00:26:43,690
Walter.

497
00:26:43,734 --> 00:26:45,634
Elizabeth.

498
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:52,167
...who was therefore unable
to produce any saliva.

499
00:26:57,415 --> 00:26:59,508
My dear...

500
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,144
My dear, have you not
forgot to wind-up the clock?

501
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:12,694
So it was the circumstances
of my conception

502
00:27:12,730 --> 00:27:16,496
were as confused
as those of my birth.

503
00:27:18,202 --> 00:27:20,466
Good night.

504
00:27:23,140 --> 00:27:24,698
Yowling won't help.

505
00:27:24,742 --> 00:27:28,200
- How is she?
- It may be some hours yet.

506
00:27:28,245 --> 00:27:30,543
- I can see the head, ma'am.
- Let me see.

507
00:27:30,581 --> 00:27:32,208
- Let me through.
- I'll fetch the...

508
00:27:32,249 --> 00:27:34,308
- No no no no.
- I can't see with the sheet...

509
00:27:34,352 --> 00:27:35,910
That's it, that's it.

510
00:27:35,953 --> 00:27:37,614
Lay her down flat! Flat!

511
00:27:37,655 --> 00:27:40,055
I can't work
like this! Flat!

512
00:27:46,163 --> 00:27:48,358
And... thank you.

513
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:50,492
Thank you very much.
Okay, that's it.

514
00:27:50,534 --> 00:27:53,025
- We'll pick up tomorrow morning...
- Are we good?

515
00:27:55,773 --> 00:27:58,037
Okay, move
the set piece, please.

516
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:04,136
Rushes screening at 8:00
for anyone involved in the battle scene.

517
00:28:04,181 --> 00:28:06,274
I can't actually
see the baby's head.

518
00:28:07,885 --> 00:28:09,648
Okay? All right, then.

519
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:12,588
Mark, we're not doing the...
you don't want the birth today?

520
00:28:12,623 --> 00:28:14,682
No, tomorrow morning.

521
00:28:14,725 --> 00:28:17,523
- That's great.
- This scene's supposed to be

522
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:19,188
about Walter's
love for his son.

523
00:28:19,230 --> 00:28:21,562
I don't feel very involved,
I feel quite peripheral.

524
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:23,760
I don't think Mark's read
the book since he was nine.

525
00:28:23,801 --> 00:28:26,065
I'm not trying
to be greedy...

526
00:28:26,103 --> 00:28:27,934
Don't worry, you're
in it, definitely.

527
00:28:27,972 --> 00:28:29,599
I'm not saying that.

528
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,972
I've got to see
Debbie about shoes.

529
00:28:32,009 --> 00:28:35,035
All right, I'll get rid of these
and I'll take you to costume.

530
00:28:35,079 --> 00:28:36,546
- All right, okay, yeah.
- Yeah?

531
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,047
- You all right?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

532
00:28:38,082 --> 00:28:39,572
Should we take
this nose off now

533
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:41,414
or should we do it
in the makeup truck?

534
00:28:41,452 --> 00:28:44,148
Yeah, 'cause I don't want...
my son won't recognize me.

535
00:28:45,189 --> 00:28:47,817
- Hey!
- Hello.

536
00:28:51,195 --> 00:28:52,787
- How are you?
- Fine, great, thank you.

537
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:56,630
Oh...

538
00:28:56,667 --> 00:28:58,658
apple crumble
and custard.

539
00:28:58,702 --> 00:29:00,329
They made me eat it.

540
00:29:00,371 --> 00:29:01,838
Steve?

541
00:29:01,872 --> 00:29:04,136
I'll take you to costume
when you're ready.

542
00:29:04,175 --> 00:29:06,166
All right, Jennie,
this is Jenny.

543
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:07,871
- Hello.
- Hello.

544
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,903
This is Jennie also,
not Jennie too, Jennie also.

545
00:29:09,947 --> 00:29:12,939
Yeah, me and Jennie
were...

546
00:29:12,983 --> 00:29:15,508
flirting before,
but now that you're here,

547
00:29:15,553 --> 00:29:18,579
we're just gonna
stop that for a while.

548
00:29:18,622 --> 00:29:20,112
- Great, good.
- Okay? Good.

549
00:29:20,157 --> 00:29:22,591
She's so beautiful.

550
00:29:22,626 --> 00:29:24,184
- What's she called?
- Thank you.

551
00:29:24,228 --> 00:29:25,718
He's a boy.

552
00:29:25,763 --> 00:29:28,288
- Right, sorry.
- He's called Steven.

553
00:29:28,332 --> 00:29:30,197
- What, Steven like his dad?
- Yeah.

554
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:33,301
- Hi.
- Hey.

555
00:29:33,337 --> 00:29:34,702
- Hello.
- You all right?

556
00:29:34,738 --> 00:29:37,036
- I'm good, how are you?
- I saw you sitting there.

557
00:29:37,074 --> 00:29:38,541
You want to be
in the movie?

558
00:29:38,576 --> 00:29:41,204
Don't, you're
upsetting him.

559
00:29:41,245 --> 00:29:43,941
Sorry, Steve, but Leo needs you
for a couple of minutes

560
00:29:43,981 --> 00:29:46,040
- to try out the womb. Is that okay?
- Now?

561
00:29:46,083 --> 00:29:47,778
Yeah, Jennie'll
take you over.

562
00:29:47,818 --> 00:29:50,582
- So, I've gotta go and do this, baby.
- It's okay.

563
00:29:50,621 --> 00:29:52,486
I'll see you later.

564
00:29:52,523 --> 00:29:54,548
- Okay.
- Nice to meet you.

565
00:29:54,592 --> 00:29:56,719
Nice to meet you.

566
00:29:59,363 --> 00:30:02,161
Your wife's
very pretty.

567
00:30:02,199 --> 00:30:04,190
Yeah yes,
she's not my wife,

568
00:30:04,235 --> 00:30:06,726
but a... girlfriend.

569
00:30:06,770 --> 00:30:10,137
Yeah, she's just up
for a couple of days.

570
00:30:10,174 --> 00:30:12,665
Hi, Steve,
thanks for doing this.

571
00:30:16,046 --> 00:30:18,344
- Wow.
- That's the womb.

572
00:30:18,382 --> 00:30:20,612
When you're talking
to the camera as Tristram.

573
00:30:22,286 --> 00:30:25,255
Yeah, I know what it is.
It's just a while since I've seen one.

574
00:30:25,289 --> 00:30:27,553
Did Mark talk to you
about being upside down?

575
00:30:29,827 --> 00:30:31,692
- No, he didn't.
- Ah.

576
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,993
That's what
we need to try out.

577
00:30:34,031 --> 00:30:36,522
Real wombs don't have
a window like that, though, do they?

578
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:38,432
- Womb with a view.
- Womb with a view.

579
00:30:38,469 --> 00:30:40,733
So that's
very good then.

580
00:30:40,771 --> 00:30:43,239
Tell my mother
I'm sorry for everything.

581
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:46,175
You'll be fine.

582
00:30:47,411 --> 00:30:49,504
You can let
the walls out now.

583
00:30:51,115 --> 00:30:53,413
Hey hey...
that's wrong.

584
00:30:54,685 --> 00:30:56,676
Okay, I'll try
the other way.

585
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:58,278
Yeah.

586
00:30:59,356 --> 00:31:00,914
Okay, lower him down.

587
00:31:02,293 --> 00:31:03,920
That's it.

588
00:31:07,598 --> 00:31:10,431
I just kept getting
caught a bit.

589
00:31:10,467 --> 00:31:12,196
That's it,
open the walls out.

590
00:31:12,236 --> 00:31:13,999
Right.
That looks great.

591
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:16,700
- It looks good?
- It looks great.

592
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,833
You've put on weight.

593
00:31:18,876 --> 00:31:21,140
- Eh?
- You've put on weight.

594
00:31:21,178 --> 00:31:23,169
I've not put on weight.

595
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,240
If I'm a fetus going off
to kick and stretch,

596
00:31:26,283 --> 00:31:28,308
that's what
fetus... feti do.

597
00:31:28,352 --> 00:31:30,616
Yeah, not when
they're full term.

598
00:31:30,654 --> 00:31:33,555
You see the baby
just about to be born,

599
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:35,183
so he'd fill
the whole space.

600
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:38,093
He'd be upside down
and his head would be wedged

601
00:31:38,128 --> 00:31:40,153
in the mother's pelvis.

602
00:31:42,166 --> 00:31:44,760
How about filming
the other way around...

603
00:31:44,802 --> 00:31:47,327
the right way up,
and then just flip the image?

604
00:31:47,371 --> 00:31:48,998
Well, maybe,
but I'd have to have

605
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,563
a word with
Mark about that.

606
00:31:50,608 --> 00:31:52,405
I mean, I think he
wanted the realism.

607
00:31:52,443 --> 00:31:54,104
- He wants realism?
- Yeah.

608
00:31:54,144 --> 00:31:56,612
Yeah, I'm a grown man
talking to the camera

609
00:31:56,647 --> 00:31:58,239
in a fucking womb.

610
00:31:58,282 --> 00:32:00,750
- Okay, all right, get me out.
- Get him out.

611
00:32:00,784 --> 00:32:03,810
Please, just get me out, he's...
he's a dick!

612
00:32:03,854 --> 00:32:06,982
- That's fine, Steve.
- All right, pull... get me out.

613
00:32:07,024 --> 00:32:08,958
- Get him out.
- Please...

614
00:32:10,728 --> 00:32:12,923
No, you jam me...
you're jamming me!

615
00:32:12,963 --> 00:32:15,488
Whoa! Easy! Easy!

616
00:32:15,532 --> 00:32:17,864
Easy, easy!

617
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:28,510
- You all right?
- Yeah yeah.

618
00:32:30,214 --> 00:32:32,182
That was great, Steve.

619
00:32:32,216 --> 00:32:33,843
Really really good.

620
00:32:33,884 --> 00:32:36,148
- Well, good.
- That's gonna work perfectly.

621
00:32:36,186 --> 00:32:39,349
I think the clothes
make it tighter.

622
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,325
It'll be all right
on the day.

623
00:32:42,359 --> 00:32:45,920
- I'm not doing it naked.
- Well, that's how babies are.

624
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:50,693
But babies don't
have to be funny.

625
00:32:50,734 --> 00:32:52,998
I think you'd
look funny naked.

626
00:32:54,571 --> 00:32:57,631
Every man thinks
less of himself

627
00:32:57,675 --> 00:32:59,802
for not having
been a soldier...

628
00:32:59,843 --> 00:33:02,676
- Dr. Johnson.
- Yeah, well, you are one now.

629
00:33:02,713 --> 00:33:04,704
He would definitely
have worn a hat.

630
00:33:04,748 --> 00:33:06,306
He would
have worn a hat.

631
00:33:06,350 --> 00:33:08,443
- Well, I've got a hat.
- No question about it.

632
00:33:08,485 --> 00:33:10,009
I hate the hat.

633
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:11,954
Yes well, you're not
Uncle Toby, are you?

634
00:33:11,989 --> 00:33:13,354
You're...

635
00:33:13,390 --> 00:33:15,051
Rob Brydon.

636
00:33:15,092 --> 00:33:16,753
Ah, that's it.

637
00:33:16,794 --> 00:33:18,523
I was trying to tell
my wife about you,

638
00:33:18,562 --> 00:33:20,223
but I couldn't
remember your name.

639
00:33:21,465 --> 00:33:23,399
Hi, Steve.

640
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:24,901
Hi.

641
00:33:24,935 --> 00:33:28,393
This is... in the reshoots
for the big scene.

642
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:29,929
I'm not in
the battle scene.

643
00:33:29,973 --> 00:33:31,702
No.

644
00:33:31,742 --> 00:33:33,869
- What do you think?
- Not bad.

645
00:33:33,911 --> 00:33:36,573
- The hat's a worry.
- It's historically accurate,

646
00:33:36,613 --> 00:33:38,911
so we have to wear it.
I don't like it either.

647
00:33:38,949 --> 00:33:40,610
- Jennie?
- Mm-hmm?

648
00:33:40,651 --> 00:33:42,949
- Can I get a coffee, please, love?
- Yeah, sure.

649
00:33:42,986 --> 00:33:45,978
- Rob, do you want one?
- Yes, please, can I have a macchiato?

650
00:33:46,023 --> 00:33:48,184
- Okay, I'll try.
- Thank you very much.

651
00:33:48,225 --> 00:33:49,886
Actually, Jennie,
can I have...

652
00:33:49,927 --> 00:33:51,622
one of those as well?

653
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:54,153
Yeah, okay.

654
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:56,257
- Shoes.
- Shoes.

655
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,768
You worry because yours
are different from Toby's.

656
00:33:58,802 --> 00:34:01,032
It's not that, it's...

657
00:34:01,071 --> 00:34:04,199
Walter in all the scenes with Toby
is supposed to dominate.

658
00:34:04,241 --> 00:34:07,369
This would have been
covered in powder.

659
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:09,709
Because of the heels,
it comes across that I'm...

660
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,977
because I'm shorter,
I'm overcompensating,

661
00:34:12,015 --> 00:34:14,245
like I've got some
Napoleon complex, you know.

662
00:34:14,284 --> 00:34:15,751
So you don't
like the shoes?

663
00:34:15,786 --> 00:34:17,777
So we just have
to vomit on them.

664
00:34:17,821 --> 00:34:20,722
I should dominate totally
in those scenes.

665
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:23,522
It should be like
I'm Gandalf and he's Frodo.

666
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,755
"You shall not
have the ring."

667
00:34:25,796 --> 00:34:27,423
Very good,
very good, Rob.

668
00:34:27,464 --> 00:34:29,091
- I do Steve as well.
- Can you?

669
00:34:29,133 --> 00:34:30,862
Can we just sort
the shoes out first?

670
00:34:30,901 --> 00:34:33,096
"Can we just sort
the shoes out first?"

671
00:34:33,137 --> 00:34:35,799
I've got a big house
in the Hollywood Hills.

672
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:37,636
Look at my pole!

673
00:34:37,674 --> 00:34:40,108
See, that's Alan Partridge,
I don't speak like that.

674
00:34:40,144 --> 00:34:42,840
- I don't talk that way. Yes, I do.
- Stop it!

675
00:34:46,717 --> 00:34:49,948
So, Rob's too tall.

676
00:34:49,987 --> 00:34:52,114
- Or you're too small.
- No no no.

677
00:34:52,156 --> 00:34:54,147
No, Rob's shoes
are too high.

678
00:34:54,191 --> 00:34:56,056
Rob's short.
That's a good thing.

679
00:34:56,093 --> 00:34:57,617
- Hmm.
- That's why he was hired.

680
00:34:57,661 --> 00:34:59,424
The problem's
continuity because

681
00:34:59,463 --> 00:35:01,522
we've already shot quite
a bit with these shoes.

682
00:35:01,565 --> 00:35:04,090
It should stand straight.
These are just too floppy.

683
00:35:04,134 --> 00:35:06,659
This is not an ego thing.
It really is...

684
00:35:06,703 --> 00:35:09,171
it's... the shoes are
key to the character.

685
00:35:09,206 --> 00:35:10,764
The character's soul...

686
00:35:10,808 --> 00:35:12,503
It's coffee,
but it's not macchiato.

687
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,067
Well, I don't understand

688
00:35:14,111 --> 00:35:16,272
why I'm here then,
in that case.

689
00:35:16,313 --> 00:35:18,508
- Great, okay.
- They want you to do it in costume.

690
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:21,017
- Is that all right?
- This is wrong.

691
00:35:21,051 --> 00:35:23,019
This is
the wrong shoulder.

692
00:35:23,053 --> 00:35:24,714
You would fire
from that shoulder.

693
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:29,488
Let's just try and get
the hats on them.

694
00:35:29,526 --> 00:35:31,551
Aha!

695
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:34,463
I'm not a happy boy.

696
00:35:34,498 --> 00:35:36,489
Right.

697
00:35:36,733 --> 00:35:39,065
- Hey, Jennie, thanks. I'll take over.
- Hey.

698
00:35:39,102 --> 00:35:40,797
Thanks.

699
00:35:40,838 --> 00:35:42,430
- Thanks, Johnny.
- All right.

700
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,271
Tony thought it would look good
if we had some crew in the background.

701
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,674
- Is that okay?
- Yeah.

702
00:35:46,710 --> 00:35:48,371
- How you doing, boy?
- Good to see you.

703
00:35:48,412 --> 00:35:51,575
Can we start with knowing me,
Tony Wilson, knowing you Steve Coogan?

704
00:35:51,615 --> 00:35:54,140
- Now, how is that?
- Let's rise above that, shall we?

705
00:35:54,184 --> 00:35:56,049
- Okay, you're right.
- No, it's just...

706
00:35:56,086 --> 00:35:59,544
it's something a TV series
did a long time ago,

707
00:35:59,590 --> 00:36:01,421
and I'm trying to like...

708
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:03,323
sort of...

709
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,918
- change the record.
- All right.

710
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:06,589
Okay, sorry,
my fault, my fault.

711
00:36:06,630 --> 00:36:08,461
I did Rob yesterday

712
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,364
and he does a fantastic
impersonation of you.

713
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:13,198
They said, "When you got to make it
like Steve, make it like Steve Coogan."

714
00:36:13,237 --> 00:36:15,102
Well, Steve,
no matter what he's doing,

715
00:36:15,138 --> 00:36:16,730
is basically...

716
00:36:16,773 --> 00:36:19,071
Oh, you're so dirty.

717
00:36:19,109 --> 00:36:21,373
I mean that's basically
whether he's Walter,

718
00:36:21,411 --> 00:36:23,038
whether he's Tristram,
whether he's Steve,

719
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:24,547
or he's Alan Partridge,

720
00:36:24,581 --> 00:36:27,175
it all boils down to that.
Steve's hero is...

721
00:36:27,217 --> 00:36:29,651
is Roger Moore.

722
00:36:29,686 --> 00:36:31,654
And Roger Moore's
style of acting

723
00:36:31,688 --> 00:36:34,680
is not a million miles
away from Steve's.

724
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,317
Yeah, I see...

725
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,193
impression I see as
a sincere form of flattery.

726
00:36:39,229 --> 00:36:41,163
He pretends he's taking
the piss, but he...

727
00:36:41,198 --> 00:36:42,688
he loves me, really.

728
00:36:42,733 --> 00:36:44,325
He's very
obsessed with me.

729
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,700
Steve Coogan,
why "Tristram Shandy"?

730
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:49,638
This is the book that many people
say is unfilmable.

731
00:36:51,174 --> 00:36:53,506
I think that's
the attraction.

732
00:36:55,245 --> 00:36:57,839
"Tristram Shandy"
was a...

733
00:36:57,881 --> 00:37:00,042
post-modern classic

734
00:37:00,083 --> 00:37:02,449
written before
there was any modernism

735
00:37:02,486 --> 00:37:04,078
to be post about.

736
00:37:04,121 --> 00:37:05,850
So it was way
ahead of its time

737
00:37:05,889 --> 00:37:08,858
and, in fact, for those
who haven't heard of it,

738
00:37:08,892 --> 00:37:11,224
it was actually
listed as number eight

739
00:37:11,261 --> 00:37:13,092
in "The Observer"'s

740
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:15,223
top 100 books
of all time.

741
00:37:15,265 --> 00:37:17,096
That was
a chronological list.

742
00:37:17,134 --> 00:37:19,796
Right. Okay...

743
00:37:19,836 --> 00:37:22,361
If you want to see
the EPK interview,

744
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,340
it'll be part
of the DVD package

745
00:37:24,374 --> 00:37:27,036
along with extended versions
of many of the scenes

746
00:37:27,077 --> 00:37:29,443
which should act as footnotes
to the main film.

747
00:37:29,479 --> 00:37:31,003
It is Tristram's story.

748
00:37:31,048 --> 00:37:34,017
It's called "The Life and Opinions
of Tristram Shandy."

749
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:35,985
So I guess it would
be Tristram's story,

750
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:38,249
whatever else
you might hear.

751
00:37:38,288 --> 00:37:39,915
Steven Coogan,
Tristram Shandy,

752
00:37:39,957 --> 00:37:41,424
thank you.

753
00:37:41,458 --> 00:37:42,982
Thank you.

754
00:37:43,026 --> 00:37:45,051
- Okay, thanks.
- Great.

755
00:37:45,095 --> 00:37:47,723
I was so pleased when
I heard you were doing this.

756
00:37:47,764 --> 00:37:49,288
It's my favorite novel.

757
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:51,631
- Really?
- Yeah, I just love it. It's fantastic.

758
00:37:51,668 --> 00:37:53,636
Who's playing Widow Wadman?

759
00:37:53,670 --> 00:37:56,571
It's my favorite character,
Widow Wadman, in the book.

760
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:59,235
- Right, she's not in the film.
- No?

761
00:37:59,276 --> 00:38:01,141
- No?
- It's a great love story.

762
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:03,271
I know, in the book
it's a great love story.

763
00:38:03,313 --> 00:38:04,803
But there's
so much in the book,

764
00:38:04,848 --> 00:38:06,406
so rich, they've
gotta... you know...

765
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,418
- It's sad, I understand.
- Loads of stuff in it.

766
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,113
You've got time
for a drink?

767
00:38:10,153 --> 00:38:11,916
The missus is here,

768
00:38:11,955 --> 00:38:13,422
- so...
- Don't you worry.

769
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,254
Let's catch up
in Manchester.

770
00:38:15,292 --> 00:38:17,055
All right, mate,
great seeing you.

771
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:18,721
Lovely to see you again.

772
00:38:18,762 --> 00:38:20,286
- All right, boy.
- Keep it up.

773
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:22,855
- God bless.
- All right, good luck. Thank you. Ed!

774
00:38:25,836 --> 00:38:28,828
Oh, Mark, I need to talk
to you about something.

775
00:38:28,872 --> 00:38:30,339
- Shoes, yeah?
- Yeah yeah.

776
00:38:30,374 --> 00:38:31,841
There's a bit
of a problem.

777
00:38:31,875 --> 00:38:33,399
- Talk to Debbie about them.
- Okay.

778
00:38:33,443 --> 00:38:35,206
We'll have a look
at rushes as well,

779
00:38:35,245 --> 00:38:36,906
go over the battle stuff.

780
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:39,415
- Okay, it's a status thing.
- No, I understand.

781
00:38:39,449 --> 00:38:42,247
- Well, 8:00, is that right?
- Yeah.

782
00:38:43,854 --> 00:38:46,982
Steve? Steve, can I
grab a lift with you?

783
00:38:47,024 --> 00:38:50,118
The minibus has gone
and left me stranded.

784
00:38:52,229 --> 00:38:54,424
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you very much.

785
00:38:54,464 --> 00:38:56,694
- Just hop in the back.
- All right.

786
00:38:56,733 --> 00:38:58,997
- It's quite chilly, isn't it?
- Isn't it?

787
00:38:59,036 --> 00:39:01,766
- Yeah.
- Brrr.

788
00:39:06,076 --> 00:39:07,873
Sorry, Steve.

789
00:39:07,911 --> 00:39:09,538
Blocking your way.

790
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:16,342
I would do a screen test
for Alexander Payne, yeah...

791
00:39:16,386 --> 00:39:17,819
Steve, so would I.

792
00:39:17,854 --> 00:39:20,186
So would Rob Brydon.

793
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,452
Okay, I'll see you
back at the hotel. Okay, bye.

794
00:39:27,497 --> 00:39:30,091
- Sorry, that was my agent.
- My agent as well.

795
00:39:30,133 --> 00:39:32,533
She just wants to talk
to me about some scripts...

796
00:39:32,569 --> 00:39:34,594
- from America. Yeah.
- Oh, right.

797
00:39:34,638 --> 00:39:37,072
Fuck you, asshole!

798
00:39:37,107 --> 00:39:39,268
Fuck you,

799
00:39:39,309 --> 00:39:41,436
you son of a bitch...
asshole,

800
00:39:41,478 --> 00:39:43,275
fuck you.

801
00:39:43,313 --> 00:39:45,907
I'm taking you down.

802
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:48,508
I hate battle scenes.

803
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:50,452
I think they're boring.

804
00:39:50,487 --> 00:39:53,115
I just don't understand why
they're bothering to reshoot this one.

805
00:39:53,156 --> 00:39:55,886
- It doesn't make any sense to me.
- I couldn't agree more...

806
00:39:55,926 --> 00:39:57,757
I mean, there is
so much in that novel.

807
00:39:57,794 --> 00:39:59,557
Why would you
choose that?

808
00:39:59,596 --> 00:40:01,359
- Do you know what I mean?
- Exactly exactly.

809
00:40:01,398 --> 00:40:03,559
Why not choose Widow...
what's-her-name?

810
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,864
No no, 'cause that's
a love story, isn't it?

811
00:40:05,902 --> 00:40:08,268
Love stories are just as boring
as battle scenes.

812
00:40:08,305 --> 00:40:10,364
What is...
what is so original

813
00:40:10,407 --> 00:40:12,432
and exciting
about the novel

814
00:40:12,476 --> 00:40:14,671
is the "Tristrampedia."

815
00:40:14,711 --> 00:40:16,838
Where Tristram...

816
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:20,577
No no, it's where Walter
spends the entire pregnancy

817
00:40:20,617 --> 00:40:23,518
like compiling
this book of knowledge

818
00:40:23,553 --> 00:40:25,350
like an encyclopedia,

819
00:40:25,388 --> 00:40:27,413
just for his son.

820
00:40:28,692 --> 00:40:30,319
The Jewish custom
of circumcision

821
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,225
came to the Jews
by way of Egypt

822
00:40:32,262 --> 00:40:35,288
or possibly
from the Syrians

823
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:38,130
or the Phoenicians
or the Capadocians,

824
00:40:38,168 --> 00:40:40,398
which suggests...

825
00:40:41,505 --> 00:40:46,306
that Zola and Pythagoras
and Ptolemy

826
00:40:46,343 --> 00:40:48,334
were all circumcised.

827
00:40:48,378 --> 00:40:51,472
If they submitted to it,
why not you?

828
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:54,746
I think that's brilliant.

829
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:57,549
Yeah, I loved
the dedication

830
00:40:57,587 --> 00:40:59,316
that Walter shows
to his son

831
00:40:59,356 --> 00:41:01,256
and I identify
with that.

832
00:41:01,291 --> 00:41:03,088
And then
you know, like,

833
00:41:03,126 --> 00:41:04,753
Tristram grows up

834
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,229
and he's nothing like
his father wanted him to be.

835
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:10,791
It just all goes wrong,
like we all go wrong.

836
00:41:10,834 --> 00:41:12,927
Because ultimately,
the way we turn out is just all

837
00:41:12,969 --> 00:41:15,938
- a matter of chance, you know?
- Yeah.

838
00:41:15,972 --> 00:41:17,803
I mean, like,
for instance,

839
00:41:17,841 --> 00:41:21,675
my mom spent her entire life
dedicating herself to me.

840
00:41:21,711 --> 00:41:24,271
She washed, she cooked,
she cleaned, she ironed,

841
00:41:24,314 --> 00:41:26,248
she worked
in the evenings.

842
00:41:26,283 --> 00:41:30,185
- She made her life a fucking misery.
- Yeah yeah, right.

843
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:33,849
You ask yourself, "What... what was
that all about?"

844
00:41:33,890 --> 00:41:36,256
- The road.
- Yeah, sorry.

845
00:41:36,293 --> 00:41:38,261
I mean, yeah,
but you know,

846
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:41,093
You do ask yourself, "What is that
all about?" You know?

847
00:41:42,933 --> 00:41:45,902
That should be
in the film.

848
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:48,928
You know, originally
I was gonna play

849
00:41:48,972 --> 00:41:50,872
Tristram and Walter.

850
00:41:50,907 --> 00:41:53,774
Yeah, that's when
it was gonna be a sitcom.

851
00:42:03,587 --> 00:42:07,819
God, look at them!
This is gonna be massive.

852
00:42:13,797 --> 00:42:16,027
There's loads of them.

853
00:42:16,066 --> 00:42:17,863
They've all brought
their own tents.

854
00:42:17,901 --> 00:42:20,961
I didn't know they had
caravans in the 18th Century.

855
00:42:29,379 --> 00:42:31,074
Steve? Steve?

856
00:42:31,114 --> 00:42:33,309
How are you
doing, man?

857
00:42:33,350 --> 00:42:36,376
Knowing me, Gary Wilson,
knowing you, Steve Coogan.

858
00:42:36,419 --> 00:42:39,252
- It was eight years ago.
- I know, but everyone loved it.

859
00:42:39,289 --> 00:42:41,120
- I know they did.
- We met on the set

860
00:42:41,157 --> 00:42:43,921
of "Around the World" and in Cannes
for "24 Hour Party People."

861
00:42:43,960 --> 00:42:45,791
- Oh right.
- What a night that was, eh?

862
00:42:45,829 --> 00:42:47,990
Well, I can't remember it,
it must have been.

863
00:42:48,031 --> 00:42:50,124
Yeah, indeed.
I spoke to Adrian,

864
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:52,828
your agent, yeah?
I'm doing a profile on you for Sunday.

865
00:42:52,869 --> 00:42:55,360
He's here,
so I'll talk to him.

866
00:42:55,405 --> 00:42:56,633
Yeah, great.
Good guy.

867
00:42:56,673 --> 00:42:58,538
- Hello!
- Hello!

868
00:42:58,575 --> 00:43:01,237
- How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

869
00:43:01,278 --> 00:43:03,143
Nice to see you... aw...

870
00:43:03,179 --> 00:43:04,840
Nice to hear us.

871
00:43:04,881 --> 00:43:06,280
You look fantastic!

872
00:43:06,316 --> 00:43:07,783
- Really good.
- I look dreadful.

873
00:43:07,817 --> 00:43:09,512
No, you don't.
You look like a mom

874
00:43:09,552 --> 00:43:11,144
who's having
to do everything

875
00:43:11,187 --> 00:43:13,246
because her husband
is away filmmaking.

876
00:43:13,290 --> 00:43:15,281
She's got
a nanny.

877
00:43:15,325 --> 00:43:17,259
But she has a nanny,
so that's good.

878
00:43:17,294 --> 00:43:18,989
Yeah. I'll
see you later.

879
00:43:19,029 --> 00:43:20,621
- I need to go to the rushes.
- Okay.

880
00:43:20,664 --> 00:43:22,495
I'm going to try
and get him down.

881
00:43:22,532 --> 00:43:23,794
Can you give us
a hand?

882
00:43:23,833 --> 00:43:25,528
I'll go see Adrian
for five minutes

883
00:43:25,568 --> 00:43:27,195
- then I'll come back.
- Okay.

884
00:43:27,237 --> 00:43:28,636
See you later.

885
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:30,469
- Hello.
- Hello.

886
00:43:30,507 --> 00:43:32,304
- How are you?
- Very well, thank you.

887
00:43:32,342 --> 00:43:35,004
- You just missed Jenny.
- No, I just saw her.

888
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:38,173
Do you mind if I just have five minutes
to talk with Adrian?

889
00:43:38,214 --> 00:43:40,205
- Do you want me to go?
- Yeah.

890
00:43:40,250 --> 00:43:43,014
- Everybody's there, you should go.
- All right.

891
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:45,078
- It's nice to see you.
- Catch you later.

892
00:43:45,121 --> 00:43:47,214
- See you later.
- Do you want a drink?

893
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:49,987
Yeah, can I have
a vodka tonic, please?

894
00:43:51,494 --> 00:43:53,689
Mm... catering
must be good.

895
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:56,528
It's just it has
all these running snacks.

896
00:43:56,566 --> 00:43:58,796
All snacks and no running
by the look of it.

897
00:43:58,835 --> 00:44:02,327
- I'm sorry about Gary being here.
- Yeah, I just saw him outside.

898
00:44:02,372 --> 00:44:06,103
He's a very
unpleasant man.

899
00:44:06,142 --> 00:44:08,406
Do you remember anyone
called Heather?

900
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:10,606
- Gobbler?
- Gobbler.

901
00:44:10,647 --> 00:44:13,343
She's a lap dancer

902
00:44:13,383 --> 00:44:14,975
and by the sound
of what she says

903
00:44:15,018 --> 00:44:18,215
you'd got up to in your hotel bedroom
on the 20th of January.

904
00:44:18,254 --> 00:44:20,586
You ought to be able
to remember her.

905
00:44:22,625 --> 00:44:24,149
Oh fuck.

906
00:44:24,194 --> 00:44:26,458
- Did you have sex with her?
- No.

907
00:44:26,496 --> 00:44:28,327
- Drugs?
- No.

908
00:44:28,365 --> 00:44:32,893
- You didn't have sex with her?
- No.

909
00:44:32,936 --> 00:44:34,927
No, you didn't?

910
00:44:34,971 --> 00:44:38,532
No... I did.

911
00:44:38,575 --> 00:44:41,669
Anything weird?

912
00:44:41,711 --> 00:44:45,670
Mm...

913
00:44:45,715 --> 00:44:47,615
- no.
- Good.

914
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:51,450
She's trying to sell
her story to Gary's rag.

915
00:44:51,488 --> 00:44:53,217
That's why he's here.

916
00:44:53,256 --> 00:44:55,747
I promised him a feature
if we can limit the damage.

917
00:44:55,792 --> 00:44:57,419
He just wants
to do a big spread

918
00:44:57,460 --> 00:44:59,928
on how your life
has completely changed

919
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:02,727
since you've had a baby, you know,
very soft and fluffy.

920
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:06,361
Well, I'm not able
to do that, so...

921
00:45:06,403 --> 00:45:09,998
- Well, just think about it.
- It's using my son.

922
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,838
- I'm not gonna do it. It's not proper.
- All right.

923
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:14,776
Just do it.
It's done and it's over.

924
00:45:14,811 --> 00:45:17,109
- It's just...
- I know.

925
00:45:17,147 --> 00:45:21,140
Here are those scripts
from America.

926
00:45:21,184 --> 00:45:24,415
The best of
the bunch is HBO...

927
00:45:24,454 --> 00:45:26,752
an English aid worker
who loses his memory

928
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,758
and falls in love
with his own daughter.

929
00:45:28,792 --> 00:45:31,158
I've read it.
It's rubbish.

930
00:45:31,194 --> 00:45:34,595
It's just...
it's TV...

931
00:45:34,631 --> 00:45:36,895
- At HBO they do a lot of good stuff.
- Mm-hmm.

932
00:45:36,933 --> 00:45:40,494
I'm too young to play someone
who falls in love with his daughter.

933
00:45:40,537 --> 00:45:43,904
You'd have to be
a pedophile.

934
00:45:43,940 --> 00:45:46,568
I mean, you gotta try
to think two films ahead.

935
00:45:46,609 --> 00:45:48,577
Don't I need
two films for that?

936
00:45:48,611 --> 00:45:51,102
Yeah well, that's what
we're trying to do, isn't it?

937
00:45:51,147 --> 00:45:54,548
Well, there you go.
I'm gonna see Jenny

938
00:45:54,584 --> 00:45:56,677
- 'cause I've gotta...
- The scripts.

939
00:45:56,719 --> 00:45:58,050
Ah, the scripts.
Yes yes.

940
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,578
I'll add those
to the rest.

941
00:45:59,622 --> 00:46:01,453
Okay, I'll see you
at the rushes.

942
00:46:01,491 --> 00:46:03,959
- See ya later. Bye.
- See you guys later. Thanks.

943
00:46:08,198 --> 00:46:11,531
Steve, Steve...
this is David Ingoldsby.

944
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:14,765
- A genuine 18th-century soldier.
- 17th century.

945
00:46:14,804 --> 00:46:16,669
You look good
for your age.

946
00:46:16,706 --> 00:46:19,402
The point is they've got
hundreds of enthusiasts

947
00:46:19,442 --> 00:46:23,742
and they're all willing,
able and... cheap.

948
00:46:23,780 --> 00:46:25,577
- Mm.
- Well, we'd do it for nothing,

949
00:46:25,615 --> 00:46:27,515
- to be honest with you.
- Don't tell him that.

950
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:29,313
He'll have have you
doing it for nothing.

951
00:46:29,352 --> 00:46:32,116
It'll be great to have a photograph
with you, though,

952
00:46:32,155 --> 00:46:33,850
'cause I'm a huge fan.

953
00:46:33,890 --> 00:46:35,585
- Fire away.
- Do you want me to take that?

954
00:46:35,625 --> 00:46:37,991
- Just point and shoot.
- All right then.

955
00:46:38,027 --> 00:46:42,191
Dave's just been in
"Around the World in 80 Days."

956
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:45,065
- Any battles?
- Well, not really.

957
00:46:45,101 --> 00:46:47,626
It was a Jackie Chan film.
Tell him...

958
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:50,332
Do you know that
the best battle scene

959
00:46:50,373 --> 00:46:51,931
is in "Lancelot du Lac"?

960
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:55,911
You know... yeah, that's right,
the Bresson film.

961
00:46:55,945 --> 00:46:58,209
It's just there are
these two knights

962
00:46:58,248 --> 00:47:00,148
and they're both
encased in armor,

963
00:47:00,183 --> 00:47:02,174
and they just keep
clobbering each other.

964
00:47:02,218 --> 00:47:03,651
You know,
it goes on forever.

965
00:47:03,686 --> 00:47:05,415
You're just hitting
and hitting.

966
00:47:05,455 --> 00:47:09,687
It's actually like a metaphor for life,
you know?

967
00:47:09,697 --> 00:47:12,427
It's about the impossibility
of actually connecting

968
00:47:12,456 --> 00:47:13,980
with another
human being,

969
00:47:14,024 --> 00:47:16,390
because we're all wearing
these carapaces,

970
00:47:16,427 --> 00:47:20,488
this casing,
this rubbish, really.

971
00:47:20,531 --> 00:47:23,364
And the more
they hit and hit,

972
00:47:23,400 --> 00:47:26,767
actually,
the less they impact.

973
00:47:26,804 --> 00:47:29,773
It's-it's just...

974
00:47:29,807 --> 00:47:31,934
really really moving,
actually.

975
00:47:31,976 --> 00:47:33,807
Mm-hmm, wow.

976
00:47:33,844 --> 00:47:36,142
- I'll see you later.
- Okay, see you later then.

977
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,114
See you later.

978
00:47:41,285 --> 00:47:43,515
What was all that about?

979
00:47:43,554 --> 00:47:45,579
Yeah, she's a bit
of a film nut.

980
00:47:45,623 --> 00:47:47,989
You should hear her
when she's on about Fassbinder.

981
00:47:48,025 --> 00:47:50,016
- Fassbinder?
- I've got a list

982
00:47:50,060 --> 00:47:53,086
of the men
that fell...

983
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:55,655
92 died
that morning,

984
00:47:55,699 --> 00:47:57,792
so your chap was lucky
to be alive.

985
00:47:57,835 --> 00:48:02,670
I could fix up your lot
with real, accurate names,

986
00:48:02,706 --> 00:48:05,436
and then they can shout out
their names to each other

987
00:48:05,476 --> 00:48:07,103
in the heat
of the battle.

988
00:48:07,144 --> 00:48:10,944
- What do we think?
- Thank you. That would be really...

989
00:48:10,981 --> 00:48:12,972
Have you seen
"Cold Mountain"?

990
00:48:13,017 --> 00:48:15,451
- Yeah.
- What do you think?

991
00:48:15,486 --> 00:48:17,477
I thought
it was good.

992
00:48:17,521 --> 00:48:19,716
I thought Nicole Kidman
was a bit old,

993
00:48:19,757 --> 00:48:22,783
- but I thought it was a good film...
- No no, the battle scenes.

994
00:48:22,826 --> 00:48:24,760
Oh, fantastic!
Very very good.

995
00:48:24,795 --> 00:48:27,423
That explosion
and when he jumps down...

996
00:48:27,464 --> 00:48:29,398
- That was the best one.
- It's shite!

997
00:48:29,433 --> 00:48:32,061
Utter shite
from beginning to end.

998
00:48:32,102 --> 00:48:34,400
Woefully inaccurate.

999
00:48:35,406 --> 00:48:36,873
Right.

1000
00:48:36,907 --> 00:48:40,001
We wouldn't be interested
in participating

1001
00:48:40,044 --> 00:48:43,480
- in a pantomime like that.
- Right.

1002
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:52,955
Splishy-splashy water.

1003
00:48:52,990 --> 00:48:55,481
Look at you go!

1004
00:48:55,526 --> 00:48:58,222
Ooh! Oh God!

1005
00:49:01,065 --> 00:49:02,760
Oh dear.

1006
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:05,268
- Will you bathe me later?
- No, I won't,

1007
00:49:05,302 --> 00:49:07,770
though you could
do with one.

1008
00:49:07,805 --> 00:49:10,433
- Those are pheromones.
- Uh-huh.

1009
00:49:10,474 --> 00:49:12,203
Can you do
the cot up?

1010
00:49:12,243 --> 00:49:13,767
A lot of women
find that sexy.

1011
00:49:13,811 --> 00:49:15,335
Daddy's gonna put
your cot up.

1012
00:49:15,379 --> 00:49:18,280
Ooh ooh ooh...

1013
00:49:26,123 --> 00:49:28,387
What's this?

1014
00:49:28,425 --> 00:49:30,655
Bach.

1015
00:49:30,694 --> 00:49:32,958
It has a calming effect
on babies.

1016
00:49:32,997 --> 00:49:35,192
My parents never
played me Bach.

1017
00:49:35,232 --> 00:49:37,860
They played me
New Seekers.

1018
00:49:37,901 --> 00:49:39,835
I turned out fine.

1019
00:49:41,472 --> 00:49:43,633
You like Bach,
don't you?

1020
00:49:43,674 --> 00:49:46,541
Yes, it makes you happy.

1021
00:49:46,577 --> 00:49:49,705
- Jenny?
- Yeah?

1022
00:49:51,282 --> 00:49:53,807
Do you think I should have
my nose straightened?

1023
00:49:53,851 --> 00:49:56,149
Oh God!

1024
00:49:56,186 --> 00:49:59,349
Do you think I've got a character
actor's nose or a leading man's nose?

1025
00:49:59,390 --> 00:50:02,291
I think it's your nose.

1026
00:50:02,326 --> 00:50:04,385
I think when
the time comes

1027
00:50:04,428 --> 00:50:06,328
I'm just gonna have
a chin tuck

1028
00:50:06,363 --> 00:50:08,024
and then leave it
at that.

1029
00:50:12,202 --> 00:50:13,635
Shh!

1030
00:50:13,671 --> 00:50:15,832
He's just nodding off.

1031
00:50:20,678 --> 00:50:22,737
No, don't answer it.

1032
00:50:27,718 --> 00:50:29,242
- Hey.
- Hi.

1033
00:50:29,286 --> 00:50:30,981
Sorry to bother you,

1034
00:50:31,021 --> 00:50:33,717
but they're screening the rushes now.
When you're ready...

1035
00:50:33,757 --> 00:50:36,021
Okay, I'll slip into
something more comfortable.

1036
00:50:40,998 --> 00:50:45,367
- What is it?
- I've gotta go see the rushes.

1037
00:50:45,402 --> 00:50:47,802
- Sorry, baby.
- Do you have to?

1038
00:50:47,838 --> 00:50:49,829
Yeah, I won't be long.

1039
00:50:49,873 --> 00:50:52,273
At least I don't
smell anymore.

1040
00:50:53,877 --> 00:50:55,811
These bottles
are filthy.

1041
00:50:55,846 --> 00:50:58,542
Probably quite expensive.
You'd think someone would clean them.

1042
00:50:58,582 --> 00:51:00,106
- Hello.
- Hi, how are you?

1043
00:51:00,150 --> 00:51:01,981
- How are you doing?
- Okay.

1044
00:51:02,019 --> 00:51:03,350
- How are you?
- Good.

1045
00:51:03,387 --> 00:51:05,287
- How are the kids?
- Good.

1046
00:51:05,322 --> 00:51:07,290
- How many is it now?
- Seven.

1047
00:51:07,324 --> 00:51:09,451
- You've got seven children.
- Yeah, seriously.

1048
00:51:09,493 --> 00:51:11,859
One for every day
of the week.

1049
00:51:11,895 --> 00:51:15,524
See, now there's a good Groucho Marx
story about...

1050
00:51:15,566 --> 00:51:18,160
see, he meets a woman
with seven children

1051
00:51:18,202 --> 00:51:20,193
and says, "Why've
you got seven kids?"

1052
00:51:20,237 --> 00:51:22,398
And she says,
"Because I love my husband."

1053
00:51:22,439 --> 00:51:26,273
He says, "Well, I like my cigar,
but I take it out now and again."

1054
00:51:26,310 --> 00:51:28,835
Here's Mark.
Okay, let's sit. Great.

1055
00:51:28,879 --> 00:51:30,676
- Have you got the tape.
- Uh no...

1056
00:51:32,816 --> 00:51:34,511
Mark's put together

1057
00:51:34,551 --> 00:51:36,485
a rough assembly
of the battle scenes

1058
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,751
and, as you all know, we had
very little money when we shot it.

1059
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:43,749
We're all agreed that we have
a possibility of a very exciting film,

1060
00:51:43,794 --> 00:51:46,058
but with a slightly
small hole in it

1061
00:51:46,096 --> 00:51:48,860
where the battle should be,
which we need to reshoot.

1062
00:51:48,899 --> 00:51:52,130
But we can talk about that
after we've seen what we've got.

1063
00:51:52,169 --> 00:51:54,637
Okay, Peter,
I'll do the lights.

1064
00:52:05,983 --> 00:52:08,213
Mel Gibson's not
gonna lose any sleep.

1065
00:52:10,754 --> 00:52:13,689
The model is more
impressive than this.

1066
00:52:16,527 --> 00:52:18,620
Stand by cannons
to reload!

1067
00:52:18,662 --> 00:52:21,256
I am leading literally
tens of men.

1068
00:52:21,298 --> 00:52:23,823
- This is a pole vaulting scene?
- I think what we need

1069
00:52:23,867 --> 00:52:25,698
is a bit
of a score under it.

1070
00:52:25,736 --> 00:52:27,727
- Quite right.
- Who's the music composer?

1071
00:52:27,771 --> 00:52:30,865
We haven't made
any decisions about that.

1072
00:52:37,781 --> 00:52:39,646
That's great.

1073
00:52:39,683 --> 00:52:42,777
Well done, everyone.
Everybody, that's where we are now.

1074
00:52:42,820 --> 00:52:44,981
If anybody wants
to say anything?

1075
00:52:45,022 --> 00:52:48,321
I think that the...
that scene,

1076
00:52:48,358 --> 00:52:51,156
because it looks so cheap,
it actually makes it funnier.

1077
00:52:51,195 --> 00:52:52,958
It works 'cause it's funny.

1078
00:52:52,996 --> 00:52:54,896
Well, it's not
supposed to be funny.

1079
00:52:54,932 --> 00:52:58,493
Toby's supposed to be funny. The battle
is supposed to look like a battle.

1080
00:52:58,535 --> 00:53:01,561
You look really really good
in your costume.

1081
00:53:01,605 --> 00:53:03,266
- Yeah.
- Yeah, you looked great.

1082
00:53:03,307 --> 00:53:04,797
There's a problem
with that too

1083
00:53:04,842 --> 00:53:07,242
'cause some of the lead costumes
are out of period.

1084
00:53:07,277 --> 00:53:08,767
They're about
50 years out of date.

1085
00:53:08,812 --> 00:53:11,542
I think I saw a Roman centurion
at one point.

1086
00:53:11,582 --> 00:53:15,211
You either go for proper,
full-on "Braveheart"...

1087
00:53:15,252 --> 00:53:17,379
clearly,
that's not an option...

1088
00:53:17,421 --> 00:53:20,322
or you go for "silly man
in a comedy battle"

1089
00:53:20,357 --> 00:53:22,222
which is well within
our grasp.

1090
00:53:22,259 --> 00:53:24,227
The thing is
we need to reshoot it.

1091
00:53:24,261 --> 00:53:27,355
Gotta have the battle scene
or haven't got a whole movie.

1092
00:53:27,397 --> 00:53:29,763
Oh no, but wait a minute.
I was reading through

1093
00:53:29,800 --> 00:53:33,099
some of Joe's old drafts. There never
was a battle scene, was there?

1094
00:53:33,136 --> 00:53:35,331
- No.
- What about the chestnut scene?

1095
00:53:35,372 --> 00:53:37,806
Do you remember when you
asked us to finance the movie,

1096
00:53:37,841 --> 00:53:39,672
you acted out a scene
where you dropped

1097
00:53:39,710 --> 00:53:41,371
a hot chestnut
down your trousers.

1098
00:53:41,411 --> 00:53:43,311
I mean, that's why
we gave you the money.

1099
00:53:43,347 --> 00:53:44,871
Ahh.

1100
00:53:44,915 --> 00:53:46,883
Went well,
I thought.

1101
00:53:46,917 --> 00:53:49,909
Except it's not Walter
who does it, is it?

1102
00:53:49,953 --> 00:53:51,921
I mean, it won't be Steve
doing it in the film.

1103
00:53:53,023 --> 00:53:55,355
Wait a minute, Joe.
You're serious?

1104
00:53:55,392 --> 00:53:59,192
- It didn't matter though...
- I've been practicing that for weeks!

1105
00:54:01,532 --> 00:54:03,898
First I tried to
keep it small,

1106
00:54:03,934 --> 00:54:07,893
then I pushed the idea of him
struggling to control the pain.

1107
00:54:09,673 --> 00:54:11,766
Then I just went for
lots of energy.

1108
00:54:16,847 --> 00:54:19,008
That looks good.
We can try that.

1109
00:54:19,049 --> 00:54:21,415
Do you wanna try it
with a real hot chestnut?

1110
00:54:21,451 --> 00:54:23,180
Try it
with a real one.

1111
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:26,121
Just an experiment to see
the general reaction.

1112
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:29,090
Agh agh fuck!

1113
00:54:29,126 --> 00:54:32,391
Shit! You put...
fuck! Fuck!

1114
00:54:32,429 --> 00:54:34,863
Agh, get it out, please!

1115
00:54:34,898 --> 00:54:36,331
Get it out!
Please, please!

1116
00:54:36,366 --> 00:54:38,800
You've got your hand
on my fucking knackers!

1117
00:54:38,835 --> 00:54:41,167
Get off! Agh!
Get off! Get off!

1118
00:54:41,204 --> 00:54:43,229
Get your hand out!
Jesus, man! Fuck!

1119
00:54:43,273 --> 00:54:45,070
Ow! Fuck!

1120
00:54:48,712 --> 00:54:51,078
It's out.

1121
00:54:51,114 --> 00:54:53,014
Fuck...

1122
00:54:53,050 --> 00:54:55,041
- Do you want some water?
- Fucking hell!

1123
00:54:55,085 --> 00:54:57,144
I'm all right,
I'm all right.

1124
00:54:57,187 --> 00:54:59,052
Fucking hell.

1125
00:54:59,089 --> 00:55:02,525
Fuck. You had your fucking
fingers up my asshole!

1126
00:55:02,559 --> 00:55:04,493
I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to do that.

1127
00:55:04,528 --> 00:55:06,189
- I'm sorry.
- Fucking hell, man.

1128
00:55:06,229 --> 00:55:08,561
- I'm very sorry.
- It's... you know...

1129
00:55:08,599 --> 00:55:10,590
Take me
to dinner first.

1130
00:55:10,634 --> 00:55:12,499
- Fuck.
- Sorry.

1131
00:55:14,738 --> 00:55:16,535
We've all seen
battle scenes before,

1132
00:55:16,573 --> 00:55:18,336
but how many times have
we seen a chestnut scene?

1133
00:55:18,375 --> 00:55:20,138
I think we need
more of Uncle Toby.

1134
00:55:20,177 --> 00:55:22,702
Uncle Toby's character is
the strongest character,

1135
00:55:22,746 --> 00:55:24,543
it's the heart and soul
of the piece,

1136
00:55:24,581 --> 00:55:26,014
the funniest character
in the book.

1137
00:55:26,049 --> 00:55:28,313
The battle scene
is Toby's scene, so...

1138
00:55:28,352 --> 00:55:30,377
That's irrelevant.
The bottom line is

1139
00:55:30,420 --> 00:55:32,650
how much will it cost
if you want to...

1140
00:55:32,689 --> 00:55:36,056
Well, we think we can
pull it down for 100,000.

1141
00:55:36,093 --> 00:55:39,290
See, I think the audience
that will come and see this film

1142
00:55:39,329 --> 00:55:41,820
is not interested
in big action scenes.

1143
00:55:41,865 --> 00:55:44,163
Anita, this is what
we don't have.

1144
00:55:44,201 --> 00:55:45,759
We don't have
the luxury of time.

1145
00:55:45,802 --> 00:55:48,362
These guys are out there now,
in uniform, loading up the muskets.

1146
00:55:48,405 --> 00:55:50,873
Don't try and hold us
to ransom about this.

1147
00:55:50,907 --> 00:55:52,602
We need to go and think
and talk about it...

1148
00:55:52,643 --> 00:55:54,634
Why don't you take
Anita and Greg off

1149
00:55:54,678 --> 00:55:57,909
and chat about the things
you need to chat about?

1150
00:55:57,948 --> 00:56:00,075
- See you, Steve.
- Go.

1151
00:56:00,117 --> 00:56:02,085
There's a shoe issue.

1152
00:56:02,119 --> 00:56:04,587
It is an issue of status.

1153
00:56:04,621 --> 00:56:06,282
Are you coming with us?

1154
00:56:06,323 --> 00:56:09,053
Turn the lights
out, please.

1155
00:56:12,596 --> 00:56:14,564
See, you can hardly
see the shoes.

1156
00:56:14,598 --> 00:56:17,226
I don't really see
what the problem is.

1157
00:56:17,267 --> 00:56:20,430
It's important characterwise
to see the height difference.

1158
00:56:20,470 --> 00:56:23,496
It tells the seniority
of the characters.

1159
00:56:24,741 --> 00:56:26,834
Is there anything
we can do about that?

1160
00:56:26,877 --> 00:56:29,277
- Um...
- Are you all right?

1161
00:56:29,312 --> 00:56:31,746
Yeah, we can um...

1162
00:56:31,782 --> 00:56:34,751
take an inch off
Rob's heel

1163
00:56:34,785 --> 00:56:38,084
and put a thicker sole
on Steve's shoe.

1164
00:56:38,121 --> 00:56:41,682
- You all right with that?
- That would be great.

1165
00:56:41,725 --> 00:56:44,626
- Okay.
- I'll do this. Thanks.

1166
00:56:44,661 --> 00:56:46,288
Let's get some lights on.

1167
00:56:46,329 --> 00:56:47,626
Steve, are you coming
to the meeting?

1168
00:56:47,664 --> 00:56:50,565
- Well, that was thrilling...
- Steve.

1169
00:56:50,600 --> 00:56:52,727
Steve, Gary's waiting
in there.

1170
00:56:52,769 --> 00:56:54,703
He's been waiting
for about 20 minutes.

1171
00:56:54,738 --> 00:56:56,171
I'll see you around.

1172
00:56:56,206 --> 00:56:58,367
Listen, I've got to
talk to this guy.

1173
00:56:58,408 --> 00:57:00,308
Five minutes
and I'll be up.

1174
00:57:00,343 --> 00:57:02,641
- Whenever.
- I want to talk to you.

1175
00:57:02,679 --> 00:57:05,045
Sorry, love.

1176
00:57:05,082 --> 00:57:08,518
Listen, I'm very sorry
about the other night, okay?

1177
00:57:08,552 --> 00:57:10,520
It was last night,
actually.

1178
00:57:10,554 --> 00:57:12,647
Oh, well...
since I was drunk.

1179
00:57:12,689 --> 00:57:14,486
Just so I know,

1180
00:57:14,524 --> 00:57:16,389
are you sorry
because you kissed me

1181
00:57:16,426 --> 00:57:18,451
or are you sorry
because you were drunk?

1182
00:57:18,495 --> 00:57:20,588
- Which is it?
- Uh... both.

1183
00:57:20,630 --> 00:57:23,997
Slightly less sorry
I kissed you

1184
00:57:24,034 --> 00:57:26,025
because it was
very nice,

1185
00:57:26,069 --> 00:57:27,764
but I don't think
it was, uh...

1186
00:57:27,804 --> 00:57:30,170
- Anyway, I'll leave you guys to it.
- Okay.

1187
00:57:30,207 --> 00:57:31,674
Hey!

1188
00:57:31,708 --> 00:57:33,539
All right,
buddy.

1189
00:57:33,577 --> 00:57:35,044
- How are you doing?
- You well?

1190
00:57:35,078 --> 00:57:36,375
Yeah, good
to see you.

1191
00:57:36,413 --> 00:57:37,505
Right, are we good?

1192
00:57:37,547 --> 00:57:39,606
I've gotta go
to a script meeting

1193
00:57:39,649 --> 00:57:42,584
and I've got to do this sort of
dad-kind-of- boyfriend thing.

1194
00:57:42,619 --> 00:57:44,814
Great. I'll take a picture of you
and the baby.

1195
00:57:44,855 --> 00:57:47,915
So can we postpone this
till tomorrow morning?

1196
00:57:50,961 --> 00:57:52,588
No, no...
you can.

1197
00:57:52,629 --> 00:57:54,187
But I've got to be
honest with you,

1198
00:57:54,231 --> 00:57:56,597
everyone at the office
wants to run the story about the girl.

1199
00:57:56,633 --> 00:57:59,033
You don't want that
because it's just weird stuff.

1200
00:57:59,069 --> 00:58:00,866
It's not weird,
just embarrassing.

1201
00:58:00,904 --> 00:58:03,031
She's saying some stuff
about me... anyway...

1202
00:58:03,073 --> 00:58:04,802
I want to
play ball too.

1203
00:58:04,841 --> 00:58:06,775
All right,
so if you can give me...

1204
00:58:06,810 --> 00:58:09,040
Yeah, 7:00 A.M.
Tomorrow morning.

1205
00:58:09,079 --> 00:58:11,047
I don't think
they're gonna go for that.

1206
00:58:11,081 --> 00:58:12,742
What do you
think's better,

1207
00:58:12,783 --> 00:58:14,808
the chicken
or the beef?

1208
00:58:14,851 --> 00:58:18,014
These rooms are fantastic,
aren't they?

1209
00:58:18,054 --> 00:58:19,521
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1210
00:58:19,556 --> 00:58:22,286
I'm in the Charles I suite.

1211
00:58:22,325 --> 00:58:24,691
Apparently
he stayed in there.

1212
00:58:24,728 --> 00:58:27,322
Yeah, just before
he was beheaded.

1213
00:58:27,364 --> 00:58:29,696
- Is that true?
- Yeah.

1214
00:58:29,733 --> 00:58:31,394
Would you like
a drink, Steve?

1215
00:58:31,434 --> 00:58:33,698
Uh yeah, I'll have
a vodka tonic, please.

1216
00:58:33,737 --> 00:58:36,228
Can we please just talk
about the script?

1217
00:58:36,273 --> 00:58:39,140
Even if we get
the battle scene shot,

1218
00:58:39,176 --> 00:58:41,144
then we're still
going to be under.

1219
00:58:41,178 --> 00:58:43,476
It's a big book.
Plenty to choose from.

1220
00:58:44,648 --> 00:58:46,377
Think I'm gonna have
a lamb shank.

1221
00:58:46,416 --> 00:58:49,214
Given that the story's about
Walter's love for his son...

1222
00:58:49,252 --> 00:58:51,186
- Here, put this in.
...I really think

1223
00:58:51,221 --> 00:58:53,519
that Walter should be there
at the birth.

1224
00:58:53,557 --> 00:58:55,889
It's the 18th Century.
Men just didn't do that.

1225
00:58:55,926 --> 00:58:58,486
You're a 21st-Century man,
but Walter can't be.

1226
00:58:58,528 --> 00:59:01,395
He talks to the fucking camera.
He can be emotional.

1227
00:59:01,431 --> 00:59:04,798
If you saw Walter for an instant
holding the baby in his arms,

1228
00:59:04,835 --> 00:59:06,894
then you would forgive him
all his flaws?

1229
00:59:06,937 --> 00:59:08,564
Yeah, but it would
look terrible.

1230
00:59:08,605 --> 00:59:10,596
It would be like the scene
in "Robin Hood"

1231
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:13,268
where Kevin Costner
delivers a baby.

1232
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:15,437
Because he's got
a stupid mullet haircut.

1233
00:59:15,478 --> 00:59:19,107
Remember all those scenes that you
pitched when we first talked about it?

1234
00:59:19,149 --> 00:59:20,411
Like the black page

1235
00:59:20,450 --> 00:59:22,042
when the good
Parson Yorick dies...

1236
00:59:22,085 --> 00:59:24,019
the book has
a completely black page.

1237
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:30,285
I don't know how interesting a black
screen is going to be for an audience.

1238
00:59:30,327 --> 00:59:32,420
The original cover
for "Anarchy in the U.K."

1239
00:59:32,462 --> 00:59:34,123
Was inspired
by that page.

1240
00:59:34,164 --> 00:59:37,531
- But Yorick isn't even in the film.
- He used to be.

1241
00:59:37,567 --> 00:59:40,058
Hardly anybody's in the film.
That's the problem.

1242
00:59:40,103 --> 00:59:42,867
I like the black page. That's one
of the arty bits I actually like.

1243
00:59:42,906 --> 00:59:45,466
Why do we want to spend
a year of our lives making this film?

1244
00:59:45,508 --> 00:59:48,477
- 'Cause it's funny.
- Is that all?

1245
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:51,780
Is that not enough?

1246
00:59:51,815 --> 00:59:54,045
If it's genuinely funny,
that is enough.

1247
00:59:54,084 --> 00:59:56,917
It has to be
genuinely funny.

1248
00:59:56,953 --> 00:59:58,921
Well, what was
all that stuff Patrick told us

1249
00:59:58,955 --> 01:00:00,889
when we visited
Shandy Hall?

1250
01:00:00,924 --> 01:00:04,291
The theme of "Tristram Shandy"
is a very simple one...

1251
01:00:04,327 --> 01:00:06,659
Life is chaotic,
it's amorphous.

1252
01:00:06,696 --> 01:00:11,030
No matter how hard you try, you can't
actually make it fit any shape.

1253
01:00:11,067 --> 01:00:14,400
Tristram himself is trying
to write his life's story,

1254
01:00:14,437 --> 01:00:17,804
but it escapes him
'cause life is too full, too rich

1255
01:00:17,841 --> 01:00:20,674
to be able to be
captured by art.

1256
01:00:20,710 --> 01:00:24,043
And his father Walter
tries to plan every aspect

1257
01:00:24,080 --> 01:00:28,039
of Tristram's birth,
conception, childhood and so on,

1258
01:00:28,084 --> 01:00:30,552
and his plans
all go wrong.

1259
01:00:30,587 --> 01:00:32,452
Walter puts it this way...

1260
01:00:32,489 --> 01:00:35,253
Did any man ever receive
so many lashes?

1261
01:00:44,301 --> 01:00:47,532
Walter is indeed
the most unfortunate of men,

1262
01:00:47,570 --> 01:00:49,435
and if his life
could be celebrated,

1263
01:00:49,472 --> 01:00:51,337
then so too
can all of ours.

1264
01:00:51,374 --> 01:00:55,310
What about Widow Wadman?

1265
01:00:55,345 --> 01:00:57,905
I've been pushing for that
since the start.

1266
01:00:57,948 --> 01:00:59,973
Widow Wadman,
that's a romantic comedy.

1267
01:01:00,016 --> 01:01:03,213
- That's bollocks.
- Who do we have for the Widow Wadman?

1268
01:01:03,253 --> 01:01:05,221
She might be free.

1269
01:01:05,255 --> 01:01:06,916
Okay, Beth
and Sam?

1270
01:01:06,957 --> 01:01:09,323
- That's good.
- Gillian Anderson.

1271
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:11,122
We know that
she loves the book

1272
01:01:11,161 --> 01:01:12,822
and Mark met her
in L.A.

1273
01:01:12,862 --> 01:01:14,887
- Did you, Mark?
- We couldn't afford Gillian Anderson.

1274
01:01:14,931 --> 01:01:16,489
She'd cost more than
the whole battle scene.

1275
01:01:16,533 --> 01:01:19,229
No, but Gillian Anderson
is an American film star.

1276
01:01:19,269 --> 01:01:21,533
I think, actually,
she's Canadian.

1277
01:01:21,571 --> 01:01:23,903
It would make it a real movie
if it had a real star.

1278
01:01:25,442 --> 01:01:27,137
Two stars.

1279
01:01:27,177 --> 01:01:29,441
I don't see myself
as a star.

1280
01:01:29,479 --> 01:01:32,107
I'm a craftsman,
like a medieval craftsman.

1281
01:01:32,148 --> 01:01:34,116
- With a Porsche.
- Plying your trade.

1282
01:01:34,150 --> 01:01:36,345
Yeah, I'm a medieval
craftsman with a Porsche.

1283
01:01:36,386 --> 01:01:39,583
Two stars...
I was just thinking

1284
01:01:39,622 --> 01:01:41,522
that's gonna be
the review.

1285
01:01:44,394 --> 01:01:46,589
"'Tristram Shandy,'
two stars.

1286
01:01:46,629 --> 01:01:48,494
Jonathan Ross.

1287
01:01:48,531 --> 01:01:49,862
If she needs
to meet...

1288
01:01:49,899 --> 01:01:51,230
We can't get her
something in time.

1289
01:01:51,267 --> 01:01:53,531
Well, I've only
written three drafts

1290
01:01:53,570 --> 01:01:54,901
with the Widow in it.

1291
01:01:54,938 --> 01:01:57,873
I've got to see Jenny.

1292
01:01:57,907 --> 01:01:59,875
- See you later, Steve.
- Yeah.

1293
01:01:59,909 --> 01:02:02,343
- Bye, Steve.
- See you later, Steve.

1294
01:02:09,919 --> 01:02:11,614
Jenny?

1295
01:02:20,397 --> 01:02:23,025
Hey... hey...

1296
01:02:23,066 --> 01:02:25,830
hey...

1297
01:02:25,869 --> 01:02:28,303
hey, aw, hey...

1298
01:02:28,338 --> 01:02:29,862
hey...

1299
01:02:29,906 --> 01:02:32,568
Oh, dear dear dear.

1300
01:02:32,609 --> 01:02:35,578
Oh, there you go.

1301
01:02:40,583 --> 01:02:43,245
Oopsie-daisy.

1302
01:03:07,610 --> 01:03:09,840
Fur ones, not the ones
full of polyester

1303
01:03:09,879 --> 01:03:11,608
'cause
they're shite.

1304
01:03:11,648 --> 01:03:13,548
- Ah, yes!
- Hey!

1305
01:03:13,583 --> 01:03:15,847
Hello!

1306
01:03:15,885 --> 01:03:18,149
Sorry, I was just changing
the baby's nappy.

1307
01:03:18,188 --> 01:03:20,748
We heard it all.

1308
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:22,417
It was very lovely.

1309
01:03:24,894 --> 01:03:27,488
We'll do
a musical next.

1310
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:29,623
Oh I see, you've been
eavesdropping on me.

1311
01:03:31,501 --> 01:03:33,025
We're celebrating.

1312
01:03:33,069 --> 01:03:35,629
Brilliant idea,
mates.

1313
01:03:35,672 --> 01:03:37,572
The money men
are lapping it up

1314
01:03:37,607 --> 01:03:40,235
- Gillian Anderson said yes.
- Really?

1315
01:03:42,078 --> 01:03:44,603
We only spoke about it
five minutes ago.

1316
01:03:44,647 --> 01:03:46,342
I know, but I phoned
her agent in L.A.

1317
01:03:46,382 --> 01:03:48,612
- Joanna, hi.
- Hi!

1318
01:03:48,651 --> 01:03:50,380
I'm calling about
"Tristram Shandy."

1319
01:03:50,420 --> 01:03:52,980
- We're in the middle of filming.
- Yes, I know.

1320
01:03:53,022 --> 01:03:54,853
I read the script.
I love it!

1321
01:03:54,891 --> 01:03:57,826
Great! I wanted to talk to you
about Gillian Anderson.

1322
01:03:57,861 --> 01:04:00,261
She's right here.

1323
01:04:00,296 --> 01:04:03,356
- Oh, hello! Mark's right here.
- Hi!

1324
01:04:03,399 --> 01:04:06,061
- Hi, Gillian? Hi.
- Hi, Mark!

1325
01:04:06,102 --> 01:04:09,128
Remember I was telling you
about "Tristram Shandy"?

1326
01:04:09,172 --> 01:04:11,037
Oh, I love that novel.

1327
01:04:11,074 --> 01:04:14,339
We've decided to include
the Widow Wadman in the story.

1328
01:04:14,377 --> 01:04:16,208
Yeah, I love
that character.

1329
01:04:16,246 --> 01:04:18,612
You know what a great fan
I am of yours.

1330
01:04:18,648 --> 01:04:20,479
Oh, that's so
sweet of you.

1331
01:04:20,517 --> 01:04:22,644
Obviously
it's a low-budget film.

1332
01:04:22,685 --> 01:04:24,880
- Oh, don't worry about that!
- That's fine.

1333
01:04:24,921 --> 01:04:26,821
Gillian's interested
in the quality of work.

1334
01:04:26,856 --> 01:04:28,881
She's not looking
for a payday.

1335
01:04:28,925 --> 01:04:31,758
- That's right.
- Great. We'll need you right away.

1336
01:04:31,794 --> 01:04:33,489
- I can fly tomorrow.
- Okay, bye.

1337
01:04:33,530 --> 01:04:35,430
- Okay, bye!
- Bye.

1338
01:04:35,465 --> 01:04:37,660
Oh yes.

1339
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:39,395
Jesus,
that was easy.

1340
01:04:39,435 --> 01:04:41,300
Yeah, that worked well.

1341
01:04:42,739 --> 01:04:44,570
So she's coming
over tomorrow.

1342
01:04:44,607 --> 01:04:45,869
That's fantastic.

1343
01:04:45,909 --> 01:04:47,900
Is Gillian Anderson
the one in "Baywatch"?

1344
01:04:47,944 --> 01:04:50,879
That was Pamela Anderson.

1345
01:04:50,914 --> 01:04:54,281
We've already got
one blonde with big tits.

1346
01:04:54,317 --> 01:04:57,514
- I love you.
- Thanks, but just a bit too hard.

1347
01:04:57,554 --> 01:05:02,184
I love "The X-Files."

1348
01:05:02,225 --> 01:05:04,250
Do you know
Rasputin had a wart

1349
01:05:04,294 --> 01:05:05,921
on his penis?

1350
01:05:08,097 --> 01:05:10,622
Listen, thank you
so much for the champagne.

1351
01:05:10,667 --> 01:05:12,464
That was lovely.
Bye.

1352
01:05:12,502 --> 01:05:14,732
- Good night.
- Night to all.

1353
01:05:14,771 --> 01:05:17,672
Good night, just going to have
a bit of sexual intercourse.

1354
01:05:17,707 --> 01:05:19,937
Thanks for the details,
thanks very much.

1355
01:05:19,976 --> 01:05:22,467
I don't think
that's their baby.

1356
01:05:22,512 --> 01:05:24,912
I don't know,
it just seems so unreal, so perfect.

1357
01:05:24,948 --> 01:05:26,779
She's very good for him,
I tell you.

1358
01:05:26,816 --> 01:05:29,284
She is very grounding
for him, don't you think?

1359
01:05:31,387 --> 01:05:33,412
- Steve?
- Jesus Christ!

1360
01:05:33,456 --> 01:05:36,983
Sorry sorry. Can I have a very
quick word with you?

1361
01:05:37,026 --> 01:05:38,550
How long have you
been there?

1362
01:05:38,595 --> 01:05:40,586
I've just been waiting for you.
Sorry, Jenny.

1363
01:05:40,630 --> 01:05:42,723
Just two minutes.
I just need to talk about something.

1364
01:05:42,765 --> 01:05:44,630
- Sure, yeah.
- Fine.

1365
01:05:44,667 --> 01:05:46,396
Thank you.

1366
01:05:48,204 --> 01:05:50,001
Have you heard
the news?

1367
01:05:50,039 --> 01:05:53,008
They're trying to get Gillian Anderson
to play Widow Wadman.

1368
01:05:53,042 --> 01:05:54,737
I know.
That was my idea.

1369
01:05:54,777 --> 01:05:57,245
- Was it?
- Well, not the Gillian Anderson bit,

1370
01:05:57,280 --> 01:05:59,475
- but the Widow Wadman thing.
- You know how I feel

1371
01:05:59,515 --> 01:06:01,813
about Gillian Anderson.
I've got posters of her.

1372
01:06:01,851 --> 01:06:03,751
I think the woman's
an angel.

1373
01:06:03,786 --> 01:06:05,981
I've got all of
"The X-Files" on DVD.

1374
01:06:06,022 --> 01:06:08,718
- I don't understand.
- Do you want a drink?

1375
01:06:08,758 --> 01:06:10,783
Yes, please. I'll have
a vodka tonic, please.

1376
01:06:13,630 --> 01:06:16,997
- The thing is I can't act...
- I know that.

1377
01:06:17,033 --> 01:06:19,058
...with Gillian Anderson.

1378
01:06:19,102 --> 01:06:22,970
I have a proper sexual thing
for Gillian Anderson.

1379
01:06:23,006 --> 01:06:26,635
I covet her. If I have to do
a love scene with her,

1380
01:06:26,676 --> 01:06:28,974
I will blush.

1381
01:06:29,012 --> 01:06:31,310
But Toby would blush.

1382
01:06:31,347 --> 01:06:34,077
That's good. Channel that.
That's method acting.

1383
01:06:34,117 --> 01:06:35,948
Yeah, right.

1384
01:06:35,985 --> 01:06:37,475
- Cheers.
- Here you go.

1385
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:39,010
I don't know
why you're worried.

1386
01:06:39,055 --> 01:06:40,784
You don't have that
many scenes with her.

1387
01:06:40,823 --> 01:06:43,053
They're putting the whole
of the love story in.

1388
01:06:43,092 --> 01:06:45,856
Steve, you've read the book.
It's 100 pages.

1389
01:06:45,895 --> 01:06:49,831
You have given me
a love story

1390
01:06:49,866 --> 01:06:53,632
with my favorite,
my ideal woman,

1391
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:57,106
my perfect
10-out-of-10 actress,

1392
01:06:57,140 --> 01:07:00,041
and I am going to
be stammering

1393
01:07:00,076 --> 01:07:02,510
and stuttering
my whole way through it.

1394
01:07:02,545 --> 01:07:05,139
- Wait wait...
- Thank you.

1395
01:07:05,181 --> 01:07:08,241
Um... I've got to go
talk to Jenny.

1396
01:07:08,284 --> 01:07:10,616
Oh, listen, Jenny mentioned
about this stuff...

1397
01:07:10,653 --> 01:07:13,281
it's not been as good
since the baby and everything.

1398
01:07:13,323 --> 01:07:15,791
- What, did she?
- All men lose their libido.

1399
01:07:15,825 --> 01:07:17,622
I don't...
no, they don't...

1400
01:07:17,660 --> 01:07:19,651
Rob, I don't have
a problem with my libido.

1401
01:07:19,696 --> 01:07:21,789
I just don't have
the fucking time.

1402
01:07:21,831 --> 01:07:23,856
For fuck's sake.

1403
01:07:28,671 --> 01:07:31,731
"I have no problem
with my libido."

1404
01:07:41,551 --> 01:07:43,542
Have you seen
my book anywhere?

1405
01:07:43,586 --> 01:07:45,679
What book?

1406
01:07:45,722 --> 01:07:48,020
"Tristram Shandy."
Which book do you think?

1407
01:07:48,057 --> 01:07:50,150
Here it is.

1408
01:07:52,762 --> 01:07:54,696
What are you doing?

1409
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:59,797
Come here!

1410
01:08:00,937 --> 01:08:02,802
Can you believe a book
as thick as that

1411
01:08:02,839 --> 01:08:04,466
hasn't got an index?

1412
01:08:04,507 --> 01:08:06,566
It's a novel,
not a cookbook.

1413
01:08:10,613 --> 01:08:12,410
It's Book Six.

1414
01:08:12,448 --> 01:08:14,075
How'd you know that?

1415
01:08:14,117 --> 01:08:17,109
And Book Eight
and Book Nine.

1416
01:08:17,153 --> 01:08:21,487
- So you knew before Rob did?
- What are you talking about?

1417
01:08:21,524 --> 01:08:24,652
Rob now has
a bigger part than me.

1418
01:08:24,694 --> 01:08:27,663
- Bet he hasn't.
- But he's got a battle scene

1419
01:08:27,697 --> 01:08:33,226
- and he's got Agent Mulder from...
- Scully.

1420
01:08:34,871 --> 01:08:36,600
And he's got big heels.

1421
01:08:36,639 --> 01:08:41,008
And you've got me
and you've got a baby

1422
01:08:41,043 --> 01:08:43,511
and you're playing
Tristram Shandy.

1423
01:08:43,546 --> 01:08:45,480
Yeah, I am playing
Tristram Shandy

1424
01:08:45,515 --> 01:08:47,176
in "The Life of
Tristram Shandy."

1425
01:08:47,216 --> 01:08:49,844
You know what? At the end
of the book, he's not even born.

1426
01:08:49,886 --> 01:08:52,684
- Who told me that? No one.
- Steve,

1427
01:08:52,722 --> 01:08:55,919
I have traveled 200 miles
by train with a baby

1428
01:08:55,958 --> 01:08:57,823
just to have sex
with you.

1429
01:08:57,860 --> 01:09:00,693
Look, honey, this is
not about my libido.

1430
01:09:00,730 --> 01:09:02,891
It's... I've got to...

1431
01:09:04,467 --> 01:09:07,732
"Presently I hope I shall be
sufficiently understood

1432
01:09:07,770 --> 01:09:10,102
in telling the reader
my Uncle Toby fell in love."

1433
01:09:10,139 --> 01:09:13,267
- Fuck.
- She's a wealthy widow.

1434
01:09:13,309 --> 01:09:15,174
She sees Toby.

1435
01:09:15,211 --> 01:09:19,773
She falls for him, but she's
worried about his equipment.

1436
01:09:19,816 --> 01:09:23,308
"...has fallen in love,
deeply in love,

1437
01:09:23,352 --> 01:09:25,217
up to the ears
in love."

1438
01:09:25,254 --> 01:09:29,714
If it is not intrusive,
Captain Shandy,

1439
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:34,890
I'm agog as to what actually occurred
at the Siege of Namur.

1440
01:09:34,931 --> 01:09:37,331
I have a model
just yonder

1441
01:09:37,366 --> 01:09:40,358
of the city as it appeared
to the besieging forces

1442
01:09:40,403 --> 01:09:43,463
on that morning
in 1695.

1443
01:09:43,506 --> 01:09:46,703
You interest me strangely.

1444
01:09:46,742 --> 01:09:50,007
The English and the Scots
came out of trenches on the right.

1445
01:09:50,046 --> 01:09:54,745
I'm quite perspiring
with anticipation.

1446
01:09:56,953 --> 01:09:59,513
You must know,
Captain Shandy,

1447
01:09:59,555 --> 01:10:02,456
that I have taken
an interest in you.

1448
01:10:02,492 --> 01:10:07,395
But before we go further
on that matter,

1449
01:10:07,430 --> 01:10:10,422
I must reassure myself

1450
01:10:10,466 --> 01:10:14,425
of your fitness
for marriage...

1451
01:10:15,872 --> 01:10:19,433
of the state
of your equipment.

1452
01:10:21,577 --> 01:10:24,068
Would you like
to see my model?

1453
01:10:24,113 --> 01:10:29,346
I must know exactly
where you were injured.

1454
01:10:29,385 --> 01:10:33,822
Madam, I'll show you
the exact spot.

1455
01:10:33,856 --> 01:10:36,347
Are you sure?

1456
01:10:36,392 --> 01:10:38,189
You can put
your finger on it.

1457
01:10:38,227 --> 01:10:41,594
- Just beyond the asparagus.
- Yes, quite right.

1458
01:10:41,631 --> 01:10:43,895
Out of the way.

1459
01:10:43,933 --> 01:10:46,800
I'm flattered,
Captain Shandy,

1460
01:10:46,836 --> 01:10:50,670
that you would take me so far
into your confidence.

1461
01:10:50,706 --> 01:10:53,140
I received my injury

1462
01:10:53,175 --> 01:10:56,633
at nine of the clock
right here.

1463
01:10:56,679 --> 01:10:59,147
That was great.

1464
01:10:59,181 --> 01:11:00,944
Thank you.

1465
01:11:02,418 --> 01:11:04,545
Rob, this is Steve
from "The New York Times."

1466
01:11:04,587 --> 01:11:06,214
Hey, I'd love
to do a piece on you.

1467
01:11:06,255 --> 01:11:07,916
That was a really
good job by the way.

1468
01:11:09,825 --> 01:11:11,554
You!

1469
01:11:11,594 --> 01:11:13,221
- Was it good?
- Yeah, it was great.

1470
01:11:13,262 --> 01:11:15,389
Where's Steve?
I really wanted him to see that one.

1471
01:11:15,431 --> 01:11:17,160
Steve's over there.

1472
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:19,360
Hello!

1473
01:11:19,402 --> 01:11:22,303
Rob? Rob?

1474
01:11:22,338 --> 01:11:23,771
Did you hear my laugh?

1475
01:11:23,806 --> 01:11:25,797
I heard a laugh.

1476
01:11:25,841 --> 01:11:28,901
- Steve Coogan? Hi.
- Hello.

1477
01:11:28,945 --> 01:11:30,572
Very pleased
to meet you.

1478
01:11:30,613 --> 01:11:32,274
Sorry about this.

1479
01:11:32,315 --> 01:11:34,749
I didn't realize
you were so small.

1480
01:11:34,784 --> 01:11:37,412
A lot smaller than me.
Come and see how small he is.

1481
01:11:37,453 --> 01:11:40,047
This membrane looks like
it's about to burst.

1482
01:11:40,089 --> 01:11:42,421
Then there'll be
a huge muscular spasm.

1483
01:11:42,458 --> 01:11:43,948
Agh!

1484
01:11:43,993 --> 01:11:46,188
Oh my God!

1485
01:11:48,397 --> 01:11:50,763
It's the funniest thing
he's done for years!

1486
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:52,665
It's just disgusting.

1487
01:11:52,702 --> 01:11:54,363
I don't know why
I'm so small.

1488
01:11:54,403 --> 01:11:56,735
- Neither do I.
- I didn't realize he was so small.

1489
01:11:56,772 --> 01:11:58,262
He really is small,
isn't he?

1490
01:11:58,307 --> 01:12:00,172
- He's tiny.
- Rob?

1491
01:12:00,209 --> 01:12:02,700
- Rob?
- That's his actual size.

1492
01:12:02,745 --> 01:12:05,373
Rob, I thought
you were a mate!

1493
01:12:48,357 --> 01:12:52,020
You should go to L.A.
And spend some time there.

1494
01:12:52,061 --> 01:12:55,895
I'd want to go. I'd want to meet
as many as I can...

1495
01:12:55,931 --> 01:12:59,128
You should. You're going to be hot
after this movie...

1496
01:12:59,168 --> 01:13:01,728
I just wanted to apologize

1497
01:13:01,771 --> 01:13:04,501
for the fact that this is a complete
historical cock-up.

1498
01:13:04,540 --> 01:13:06,735
And in order to make it
a bit more fun,

1499
01:13:06,776 --> 01:13:09,609
I'm gonna give everybody
a character name, okay?

1500
01:13:09,645 --> 01:13:12,205
- Yay!
- So, Eli Thrift.

1501
01:13:12,248 --> 01:13:14,409
Free Fornication Williams.

1502
01:13:14,450 --> 01:13:16,782
Feichmann,
have you got a mic?

1503
01:13:16,819 --> 01:13:19,549
Well, then you shouldn't be
wearing a gorget. Take it off.

1504
01:13:19,588 --> 01:13:21,579
Okay, Efrain Greenwillow,

1505
01:13:21,624 --> 01:13:24,218
- you can have that.
- Have you heard?

1506
01:13:25,227 --> 01:13:27,457
They're so chuffed
about Gillian Anderson,

1507
01:13:27,496 --> 01:13:29,964
they're going to give us some money
for the battle scene as well.

1508
01:13:29,999 --> 01:13:31,933
- That's great.
- And Joe has had an idea

1509
01:13:31,967 --> 01:13:34,902
for the birth scene, so you can go there
when the baby's born.

1510
01:13:34,937 --> 01:13:36,962
Oh, brilliant. That's great.

1511
01:13:38,340 --> 01:13:40,934
Where's your pretty wife,
Steve?

1512
01:13:40,976 --> 01:13:42,568
Come on!

1513
01:13:52,722 --> 01:13:55,350
- Hello.
- So they're going to have love story

1514
01:13:55,391 --> 01:13:57,154
and the battle scene.

1515
01:13:57,193 --> 01:13:58,751
That's great.

1516
01:13:58,794 --> 01:14:01,160
It's like some Hollywood version
of "Tristram Shandy."

1517
01:14:01,197 --> 01:14:04,291
Yeah, Fassbinder
would have never sold out like that.

1518
01:14:04,333 --> 01:14:06,233
You know Fassbinder?

1519
01:14:06,268 --> 01:14:08,498
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow!

1520
01:14:08,537 --> 01:14:11,404
Which is
your favorite film?

1521
01:14:12,842 --> 01:14:14,503
The whole...

1522
01:14:14,543 --> 01:14:16,067
the corpus,
the bloody work.

1523
01:14:16,112 --> 01:14:18,603
"Fear Eats the Soul."

1524
01:14:18,647 --> 01:14:21,207
Yeah.

1525
01:14:21,250 --> 01:14:23,047
There's more truth
in that title

1526
01:14:23,085 --> 01:14:25,315
than there is in most whole movies,
you know?

1527
01:14:25,354 --> 01:14:27,345
- Yeah.
- But the thing is

1528
01:14:27,389 --> 01:14:30,688
he's such like
a powerful writer.

1529
01:14:30,726 --> 01:14:32,489
You know
"Schatten der Engel"

1530
01:14:32,528 --> 01:14:34,826
That is my favorite.

1531
01:14:34,864 --> 01:14:37,833
- Do you know that one?
- Is it the one with all the sex in it.

1532
01:14:37,867 --> 01:14:42,395
No, it's the one where Ingrid Caven
is this prostitute,

1533
01:14:42,438 --> 01:14:45,430
but the thing is
that she's so beautiful

1534
01:14:45,474 --> 01:14:48,034
she doesn't even need
to touch the punters.

1535
01:14:48,077 --> 01:14:50,773
They're just happy
to, like, sit in her room

1536
01:14:50,813 --> 01:14:52,644
and just look at her.

1537
01:14:52,681 --> 01:14:55,878
The thing is that
humanity is so disgusting

1538
01:14:55,918 --> 01:14:59,786
they kind of, like, invade
and pollute her with their problems

1539
01:14:59,822 --> 01:15:02,586
and their insecurities
so that in the end,

1540
01:15:02,625 --> 01:15:05,389
it's actually better for her
to just fuck them.

1541
01:15:05,427 --> 01:15:07,622
You know, it's cleaner
for her to fuck them

1542
01:15:07,663 --> 01:15:09,153
than it is
to listen to them.

1543
01:15:09,198 --> 01:15:11,132
You're watching the movie
and you're, like,

1544
01:15:11,167 --> 01:15:13,032
"Just fuck them, Lilly!
Just fuck them!"

1545
01:15:13,068 --> 01:15:14,831
- Do you know what I mean?
- Fuck them.

1546
01:15:18,374 --> 01:15:20,137
Fill me
with your babies.

1547
01:15:27,383 --> 01:15:30,284
What what what?
What did you say?

1548
01:15:30,319 --> 01:15:33,152
What did you
just say?

1549
01:15:33,189 --> 01:15:36,215
I don't know.
I think I said, "Fuck me."

1550
01:15:36,258 --> 01:15:38,692
- I think.
- The thing is...

1551
01:15:38,727 --> 01:15:40,558
no, you said
something else.

1552
01:15:40,596 --> 01:15:42,325
That's not
what you said.

1553
01:15:42,364 --> 01:15:43,991
It's what I meant.

1554
01:15:44,033 --> 01:15:45,967
Listen, um...

1555
01:15:46,001 --> 01:15:49,630
you are fantastically
attractive

1556
01:15:49,672 --> 01:15:54,075
and your knowledge of
German cinema is second to none.

1557
01:15:55,578 --> 01:16:00,106
But... I've got to
get back to Jenny.

1558
01:16:00,149 --> 01:16:02,674
I've got work
in the morning,

1559
01:16:02,718 --> 01:16:04,515
it's an early start.

1560
01:16:04,553 --> 01:16:07,113
6:30 A.M. Call,
I think.

1561
01:16:07,156 --> 01:16:10,751
Yeah so...
good night.

1562
01:16:10,793 --> 01:16:13,023
Yeah, good night.

1563
01:16:13,062 --> 01:16:14,495
I am Spartacus!

1564
01:16:14,530 --> 01:16:16,896
Push on!

1565
01:16:18,400 --> 01:16:21,392
I am Spartacus!

1566
01:16:21,437 --> 01:16:23,462
I am Spartacus!

1567
01:16:24,740 --> 01:16:27,072
Jennie, I am Spartacus.

1568
01:16:29,245 --> 01:16:31,679
I am Spartacus.

1569
01:16:31,714 --> 01:16:35,172
- I am Spartacus.
- I am Spartacus!

1570
01:16:52,701 --> 01:16:54,794
Where have you been?

1571
01:16:54,837 --> 01:16:57,305
You're freezing!

1572
01:16:59,108 --> 01:17:01,133
I had a nightmare.

1573
01:17:12,254 --> 01:17:14,313
I missed you.

1574
01:17:15,891 --> 01:17:17,586
I missed you.

1575
01:17:24,366 --> 01:17:26,664
I love you.

1576
01:17:58,834 --> 01:18:00,665
Steve, it's time
to get up.

1577
01:18:09,011 --> 01:18:12,538
Morning. Your car will be ready
in half an hour, okay?

1578
01:18:12,581 --> 01:18:14,173
Right, thank you,
Jennie.

1579
01:18:19,121 --> 01:18:22,454
- I'm sorry.
- He'll be okay for a couple of minutes.

1580
01:18:28,597 --> 01:18:30,724
God, you're
so lucky.

1581
01:18:35,938 --> 01:18:38,236
This morning's headlines...

1582
01:18:38,273 --> 01:18:40,901
Americans have conceded
that the insurgents in Iraq

1583
01:18:40,943 --> 01:18:43,036
are as strong now
as they were a year ago.

1584
01:18:43,078 --> 01:18:46,775
More foreign terror suspects
are expected to be freed on bail today

1585
01:18:46,815 --> 01:18:50,444
as time runs out for the existing powers
under which they're detained.

1586
01:18:50,486 --> 01:18:52,784
And what Churchill
thought of India

1587
01:18:52,821 --> 01:18:54,686
and what India
thought of Churchill.

1588
01:18:54,723 --> 01:18:57,089
Today's newsreader,
Charlotte Green.

1589
01:18:57,126 --> 01:18:58,957
A senior American general

1590
01:18:58,994 --> 01:19:02,452
has said the insurgents in Iraq
have lost none of their capacity

1591
01:19:02,498 --> 01:19:04,989
to launch attacks
on Coalition and Iraqi...

1592
01:19:06,602 --> 01:19:08,729
- Morning.
- Morning.

1593
01:19:08,771 --> 01:19:10,261
- Morning.
- Hi.

1594
01:19:10,305 --> 01:19:13,604
Rob, did you want me
to get you some breakfast?

1595
01:19:13,642 --> 01:19:15,576
- Some coffee?
- I'll have a coffee.

1596
01:19:15,611 --> 01:19:17,374
- Okay.
- Everyone's here?

1597
01:19:17,413 --> 01:19:20,382
Yeah, they are, actually. Do you
want me to get you some breakfast?

1598
01:19:20,416 --> 01:19:21,940
No no, I'll go with you.
Been here for ages.

1599
01:19:21,984 --> 01:19:24,384
Top o' the mornin'
to ye.

1600
01:19:24,420 --> 01:19:27,082
...but once I get the other sock...
- See you.

1601
01:19:28,657 --> 01:19:31,148
Morning, uh...

1602
01:19:31,193 --> 01:19:32,490
- Rr-r...
- Rob.

1603
01:19:32,528 --> 01:19:34,428
- Rob.
- That's it, well done.

1604
01:19:34,463 --> 01:19:36,522
It's the shoe business,
you know?

1605
01:19:36,565 --> 01:19:38,533
It goes on all day
between Steve and Rob.

1606
01:19:38,567 --> 01:19:41,229
I've got the shoes
for you.

1607
01:19:41,270 --> 01:19:44,034
They've been built up
so you'll feel a lot taller.

1608
01:19:44,073 --> 01:19:48,032
Be hard to see Jennie.
She's a bit... intense.

1609
01:19:48,077 --> 01:19:50,978
Very. Hard work.

1610
01:19:51,013 --> 01:19:53,379
Do you know
this shoe thing,

1611
01:19:53,415 --> 01:19:55,849
I think we're fine
as we are.

1612
01:19:55,884 --> 01:19:57,579
I spent all night
working on it.

1613
01:19:57,619 --> 01:19:59,883
- I think we've got spare ones.
- Sorry, love.

1614
01:19:59,922 --> 01:20:01,446
We got spare ones here.

1615
01:20:01,490 --> 01:20:04,220
- Okay.
- Sorry, love. Thank you.

1616
01:20:07,062 --> 01:20:10,327
- Um, Steve.
- Well handled.

1617
01:20:10,365 --> 01:20:12,629
This is the coat, Steve,

1618
01:20:12,668 --> 01:20:14,966
for the scene where
you take your wig off.

1619
01:20:15,003 --> 01:20:17,767
- Want to just try it on for me?
- Sure.

1620
01:20:17,806 --> 01:20:20,639
- All right, love.
- Take your wig off with the right hand

1621
01:20:20,676 --> 01:20:23,372
and pull your handkerchief
out of your right-hand pocket...

1622
01:20:23,412 --> 01:20:26,813
- This is actually weird.
...with the left hand.

1623
01:20:26,849 --> 01:20:28,976
- I mean, that's...
- You look like Lee Evans.

1624
01:20:29,017 --> 01:20:32,919
It looks like
the pockets are too low.

1625
01:20:32,955 --> 01:20:35,981
It looks like they've been placed there
for comic effect.

1626
01:20:36,024 --> 01:20:38,151
Shall we say it looks
like a rain suit?

1627
01:20:38,193 --> 01:20:39,990
"In the latter end
of Queen Anne's reign,

1628
01:20:40,028 --> 01:20:41,928
and the beginning
of King George I,

1629
01:20:41,964 --> 01:20:44,159
coat pockets were cut
very low down

1630
01:20:44,199 --> 01:20:47,828
- in the skirt."
- The pockets can be built

1631
01:20:47,870 --> 01:20:50,338
technically accurate
and still look contrived.

1632
01:20:50,372 --> 01:20:52,772
It's historical,

1633
01:20:52,808 --> 01:20:54,969
but it's not
hysterical.

1634
01:20:55,010 --> 01:20:57,001
Yeah.

1635
01:20:58,847 --> 01:21:02,010
- Hey, Joe!
- Hello, Steve.

1636
01:21:02,050 --> 01:21:03,813
Listen, I'll see you
tomorrow.

1637
01:21:03,852 --> 01:21:05,877
I'm going to
get the kids

1638
01:21:05,921 --> 01:21:07,980
- to see the battle.
- Brilliant.

1639
01:21:08,023 --> 01:21:09,650
How'd the
birth scenes go?

1640
01:21:09,691 --> 01:21:12,125
- All done, yeah.
- Fantastic.

1641
01:21:12,161 --> 01:21:14,026
Trying to get the impact of having
a baby on Walter,

1642
01:21:14,062 --> 01:21:15,893
your physical
and emotional impact.

1643
01:21:15,931 --> 01:21:17,660
- Yes!
- You all right?

1644
01:21:17,699 --> 01:21:19,997
- Yes, very well.
- Listen, we've gotta get a shift on.

1645
01:21:20,035 --> 01:21:21,525
I need to do something.
Hiya.

1646
01:21:21,570 --> 01:21:24,539
I'll need to get a train,
so can we just find somewhere...

1647
01:21:24,573 --> 01:21:26,837
I'm gonna need
five minutes for Gary.

1648
01:21:26,875 --> 01:21:28,399
- 10 minutes.
- Sorry.

1649
01:21:28,443 --> 01:21:30,035
Does Mark know
about this, Steve?

1650
01:21:30,078 --> 01:21:31,739
He doesn't know.
Tell him not to worry.

1651
01:21:31,780 --> 01:21:33,645
I just wanna do
a really general piece,

1652
01:21:33,682 --> 01:21:36,378
you know, the type of thing
I'm sure you've done before.

1653
01:21:36,418 --> 01:21:39,353
- Yes.
- Steve Coogan the actor,

1654
01:21:39,388 --> 01:21:41,788
Steve Coogan
the family man.

1655
01:21:41,823 --> 01:21:43,916
And with the novel
being called

1656
01:21:43,959 --> 01:21:46,325
"The Life and Opinions
of Tristram Shandy,"

1657
01:21:46,361 --> 01:21:49,660
I thought we'd call the piece
"The Life and Opinions of Steve Coogan."

1658
01:21:49,698 --> 01:21:52,326
- Great. Tidy
- Yeah.

1659
01:21:52,367 --> 01:21:55,803
Just a sort of tidy...
exactly.

1660
01:21:55,837 --> 01:21:58,397
But really, obviously
you've just become a father.

1661
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,704
- Yeah.
- So let's do a little bit

1662
01:22:00,742 --> 01:22:03,677
about the family to start off.
What does it mean to you?

1663
01:22:03,712 --> 01:22:05,942
Well, it's everything to me.

1664
01:22:09,451 --> 01:22:11,578
- Hi, babe.
- Hiya.

1665
01:22:14,223 --> 01:22:17,215
- How is he?
- He's a bit... grumpy

1666
01:22:17,259 --> 01:22:19,056
- this morning.
- Sorry.

1667
01:22:19,094 --> 01:22:20,925
Sorry.

1668
01:22:20,963 --> 01:22:24,091
Steve, we've got
your other baby next door

1669
01:22:24,132 --> 01:22:26,657
if you'd like to come and say hello,
do a bit of bonding.

1670
01:22:26,702 --> 01:22:28,670
That's Walter's
little baby.

1671
01:22:28,704 --> 01:22:31,298
- I'll explain later.
- It might take a minute.

1672
01:22:31,340 --> 01:22:32,830
Okay.
See you later, love.

1673
01:22:32,874 --> 01:22:34,671
See you.

1674
01:22:36,378 --> 01:22:38,710
I've got the new sides
from Joe...

1675
01:22:38,747 --> 01:22:40,305
- Good.
...for the scene as well.

1676
01:22:40,349 --> 01:22:41,782
He spoke to me
this morning.

1677
01:22:41,817 --> 01:22:44,081
- He's very pleased with it.
- Great, I'm pleased.

1678
01:22:44,119 --> 01:22:45,677
- This is Rachel.
- Hi.

1679
01:22:45,721 --> 01:22:47,951
And little Tristram.

1680
01:22:47,990 --> 01:22:49,617
- Oh...
- I'll catch you later.

1681
01:22:49,658 --> 01:22:52,149
Okay, right. He's got a better
hairline than me.

1682
01:22:52,194 --> 01:22:54,025
She's a girl, actually.

1683
01:22:54,062 --> 01:22:56,622
I hope that's not
going to be a problem for you.

1684
01:22:56,665 --> 01:22:58,895
No, I'm very in touch
with my female side.

1685
01:22:58,934 --> 01:23:00,128
Everyone miked up?

1686
01:23:00,168 --> 01:23:01,897
Yeah, with
the time we need.

1687
01:23:01,937 --> 01:23:03,700
Okay, all right.

1688
01:23:03,739 --> 01:23:05,764
- Ed?
- Yes, sir.

1689
01:23:05,807 --> 01:23:07,775
Let's get it
all locked up.

1690
01:23:07,809 --> 01:23:10,209
Yeah, okay. Byron, can we just get
this moving now? Thanks.

1691
01:23:10,245 --> 01:23:12,713
She likes you.
She's very happy.

1692
01:23:12,748 --> 01:23:15,376
Hey! Aw...

1693
01:23:15,417 --> 01:23:18,147
She's so small.

1694
01:23:19,721 --> 01:23:21,382
- Steve?
- Yeah?

1695
01:23:21,423 --> 01:23:23,118
They're ready for you
on the set.

1696
01:23:23,158 --> 01:23:24,853
Oh...
that's Mommy.

1697
01:23:24,893 --> 01:23:29,227
Okay, I've just got to
say goodbye to Jenny,

1698
01:23:29,264 --> 01:23:30,959
just say goodbye.

1699
01:23:33,535 --> 01:23:36,095
Three days in a row
you've been screaming.

1700
01:23:36,138 --> 01:23:37,799
It's only one more day.

1701
01:23:37,839 --> 01:23:39,170
It finishes today.

1702
01:23:44,946 --> 01:23:47,244
- Good morning.
- Good morning. How are you?

1703
01:23:47,282 --> 01:23:49,773
Hello.

1704
01:23:49,818 --> 01:23:51,683
Could we get Steven?

1705
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:53,915
Thank you.
I'll try to stay awake.

1706
01:23:56,058 --> 01:23:58,356
Joe has written in
this part of the scene

1707
01:23:58,393 --> 01:24:00,327
where Walter's there
at the birth of Tristram.

1708
01:24:00,362 --> 01:24:02,455
- It's really important.
- It's fine.

1709
01:24:02,497 --> 01:24:04,965
Steve, there waiting
for you on the set.

1710
01:24:05,000 --> 01:24:07,264
Okay, all right.

1711
01:24:07,302 --> 01:24:09,566
Listen, have
a safe journey.

1712
01:24:09,604 --> 01:24:11,469
- I'll see you on the weekend.
- Okay.

1713
01:24:11,506 --> 01:24:13,565
Would you have had
a baby with me

1714
01:24:13,608 --> 01:24:16,008
- if I'd really had a nose like that?
- No.

1715
01:24:18,413 --> 01:24:20,176
I'll give you a call
when we get there.

1716
01:24:20,215 --> 01:24:21,876
Okay, I love you.

1717
01:24:25,053 --> 01:24:27,214
- It doesn't seem right.
- No, it's wrong.

1718
01:24:27,255 --> 01:24:28,950
Okay, sorry about that.

1719
01:24:39,334 --> 01:24:41,734
I'm just a bit confused.
Are we supposed to...

1720
01:24:41,770 --> 01:24:44,671
It's not continuous.
We've jumped in time.

1721
01:24:44,706 --> 01:24:47,903
We've jumped in time.
We're going to take that moment

1722
01:24:47,943 --> 01:24:49,934
where the kid's
about to be born...

1723
01:24:49,978 --> 01:24:51,605
- Right.
...from here.

1724
01:24:51,646 --> 01:24:53,511
So this is
the very end of it.

1725
01:24:53,548 --> 01:24:55,038
Very end of it.

1726
01:24:55,083 --> 01:24:56,573
- Okay?
- Right.

1727
01:24:56,618 --> 01:25:00,418
Hi. Um...
all right.

1728
01:25:09,631 --> 01:25:12,122
Hold the work, please.

1729
01:25:13,135 --> 01:25:14,966
Hold the work.

1730
01:25:15,003 --> 01:25:17,028
- So, Steve?
- Yeah?

1731
01:25:17,072 --> 01:25:19,336
We'll have about
40 seconds of...

1732
01:25:19,374 --> 01:25:22,639
effort before
your entrance, okay?

1733
01:25:36,124 --> 01:25:37,887
Say, what's
happening?

1734
01:25:43,532 --> 01:25:46,000
All right,
his head's here now!

1735
01:25:50,705 --> 01:25:52,570
We're just about done.

1736
01:25:57,679 --> 01:25:59,340
Okay, Steve.

1737
01:26:03,084 --> 01:26:05,644
A little more, ma'am.
A little more.

1738
01:26:05,687 --> 01:26:07,746
That's it.

1739
01:26:10,292 --> 01:26:11,850
That's it, ma'am.

1740
01:26:19,401 --> 01:26:21,369
That's it.

1741
01:26:22,904 --> 01:26:26,567
He's handsome, ma'am.
He's a handsome... boy.

1742
01:26:28,677 --> 01:26:30,201
He's a big boy.

1743
01:26:44,192 --> 01:26:45,716
Thanks very much,
everybody.

1744
01:26:45,760 --> 01:26:47,853
There's a drink
through there,

1745
01:26:47,896 --> 01:26:50,865
so... if you'd like
to go on through.

1746
01:26:50,899 --> 01:26:53,197
- What happened?
- Um...

1747
01:26:54,469 --> 01:26:56,232
So what do you think
about that?

1748
01:26:56,271 --> 01:26:59,468
- Can you tell that's not me on horse?
- Yes.

1749
01:26:59,508 --> 01:27:01,999
- Do you ride a horse?
- Yes, I rode a horse.

1750
01:27:02,043 --> 01:27:04,807
You look like you'd never
been on a horse before.

1751
01:27:04,846 --> 01:27:06,814
You were funny,
you were charismatic...

1752
01:27:06,848 --> 01:27:08,873
- Charismatic?
- You looked so dashing.

1753
01:27:08,917 --> 01:27:10,407
- I looked so dashing?
- You did.

1754
01:27:10,452 --> 01:27:11,783
I was dashing.
I dashed.

1755
01:27:11,820 --> 01:27:14,254
What happened to
the whole Widow Wadman story?

1756
01:27:14,289 --> 01:27:15,984
How much did you do?

1757
01:27:16,024 --> 01:27:18,925
I shot like two weeks.

1758
01:27:18,960 --> 01:27:22,157
I mean, the house is
way too big for Shandy Hall.

1759
01:27:22,197 --> 01:27:24,597
Well, that's what they wanted to make
the film look sexy.

1760
01:27:24,633 --> 01:27:26,692
I thought you look fantastic,
by the way.

1761
01:27:26,735 --> 01:27:28,293
- And you.
- For what it's worth.

1762
01:27:28,336 --> 01:27:29,735
- Yeah.
- All right.

1763
01:27:29,771 --> 01:27:31,261
See you in a bit.

1764
01:27:33,341 --> 01:27:35,400
- Great, just great.
- Ah, yes.

1765
01:27:35,443 --> 01:27:37,434
Thank you,
rather good on that.

1766
01:27:37,479 --> 01:27:39,470
I thought we were gonna get
the big emotional scene

1767
01:27:39,514 --> 01:27:40,913
with Walter
and his baby.

1768
01:27:40,949 --> 01:27:43,281
Yeah, well,
the 18th Century...

1769
01:27:43,318 --> 01:27:45,912
- it didn't work.
- We thought the scene

1770
01:27:45,954 --> 01:27:49,549
with Steve and the baby playing
young Tristram would give us the emotion

1771
01:27:49,591 --> 01:27:51,752
and still be true
to the original story.

1772
01:27:51,793 --> 01:27:54,261
I always forget
how short I am.

1773
01:27:54,296 --> 01:27:56,924
I can't believe that was
the whole fucking movie.

1774
01:27:56,965 --> 01:28:00,457
I think we look like
a nice couple, don't you?

1775
01:28:00,502 --> 01:28:03,596
Where is
the battle scene?

1776
01:28:03,638 --> 01:28:05,503
Yeah, where's the battle?

1777
01:28:05,540 --> 01:28:08,668
It wasn't funny.

1778
01:28:08,710 --> 01:28:10,678
So how many drinks
do you have a day?

1779
01:28:10,712 --> 01:28:13,840
I have... I don't know...
a number.

1780
01:28:13,882 --> 01:28:16,009
And I purposely have
a pay-to-go,

1781
01:28:16,051 --> 01:28:17,746
and I only keep
£10 on it

1782
01:28:17,786 --> 01:28:19,617
so that I can't stay
on the phone long.

1783
01:28:19,654 --> 01:28:21,349
That way I'm just
quickly off.

1784
01:28:21,389 --> 01:28:24,916
- How does the book end?
- The book's got a great ending.

1785
01:28:25,961 --> 01:28:27,758
- Parson Yorick.
- Mm?

1786
01:28:27,796 --> 01:28:31,493
Why are we so delicate
about the subject of passion?

1787
01:28:31,533 --> 01:28:35,264
Why do we put a candle out
when we try to make a child?

1788
01:28:35,303 --> 01:28:38,204
I'm not sure.

1789
01:28:38,239 --> 01:28:40,707
Everyone does put out a candle,
Sir Walter.

1790
01:28:40,742 --> 01:28:44,007
Though you see, Walter,
not everybody does put the candle out.

1791
01:28:44,045 --> 01:28:47,014
I have on occasion asked for the candle
to be left, but...

1792
01:28:47,048 --> 01:28:48,845
Be that as it may,

1793
01:28:48,883 --> 01:28:52,717
why do we glorify the act of killing
that's destroying a man?

1794
01:28:52,754 --> 01:28:55,746
We honor the weapons
with which we do it.

1795
01:28:55,790 --> 01:28:57,917
We write about them.

1796
01:28:57,959 --> 01:28:59,756
We paint them.

1797
01:28:59,794 --> 01:29:03,025
- Obadiah.
- Good evening, Parson Yorick.

1798
01:29:03,064 --> 01:29:06,795
Has that cow of yours
calved yet?

1799
01:29:06,835 --> 01:29:09,030
Well, that's just it.

1800
01:29:09,070 --> 01:29:10,867
My cow has not
calved yet.

1801
01:29:10,905 --> 01:29:14,671
Will thou have this woman
to thy wedded wife,

1802
01:29:14,709 --> 01:29:16,836
to live together...

1803
01:29:16,878 --> 01:29:19,870
It so happened that
Obadiah was married

1804
01:29:19,914 --> 01:29:22,747
on the same day my father's bull was
introduced to his cow.

1805
01:29:24,085 --> 01:29:26,246
Now the custom was
that my father's bull

1806
01:29:26,287 --> 01:29:28,585
served all the cows
in the parish.

1807
01:29:28,623 --> 01:29:30,955
But the truth was,
the parish was so large

1808
01:29:30,992 --> 01:29:34,393
my father's bull
was not equal to the task.

1809
01:29:34,429 --> 01:29:36,659
But as he went about
his business

1810
01:29:36,698 --> 01:29:38,893
with a grave face,

1811
01:29:38,933 --> 01:29:41,868
my father regarded him
very highly.

1812
01:29:41,903 --> 01:29:44,303
When the baby was born,

1813
01:29:44,339 --> 01:29:46,398
Obadiah hoped
the cow would calf.

1814
01:29:46,441 --> 01:29:51,208
- She didn't.
...both water and wine.

1815
01:29:51,246 --> 01:29:53,043
May not a cow
be barren?

1816
01:29:53,081 --> 01:29:56,539
- Never happen.
- My bull is as good one as ever pissed.

1817
01:29:56,584 --> 01:29:58,711
If you attack his character,
you attack his life.

1818
01:29:58,753 --> 01:30:01,449
Good Lord, what is
this story all about?

1819
01:30:01,489 --> 01:30:04,253
Cock and a bull story.

1820
01:30:04,292 --> 01:30:08,319
Cock and a... bull.

1821
01:30:08,363 --> 01:30:10,763
- Mm.
- Cock and bull tale.

1822
01:30:14,102 --> 01:30:16,935
Cock and bull's tale.

1823
01:30:16,971 --> 01:30:20,805
- Cock and bull.
- Cock and bull.

1824
01:30:22,610 --> 01:30:24,441
- Brother.
- Sorry.

1825
01:30:25,914 --> 01:30:28,610
And the best of its kind
I ever heard.

1826
01:30:45,500 --> 01:30:47,024
I like it.

1827
01:30:48,403 --> 01:30:49,893
I thought
it was good.

1828
01:30:49,938 --> 01:30:53,772
That's the area,
that's the area.

1829
01:30:53,808 --> 01:30:56,572
- Right there.
- Okay okay.

1830
01:30:56,611 --> 01:30:58,977
What do you think?
A little piece?

1831
01:30:59,013 --> 01:31:01,538
- A piece?
- Rob, I've seen enough.

1832
01:31:01,583 --> 01:31:04,074
It's registered
logged.

1833
01:31:04,119 --> 01:31:07,850
- But how big is it?
- There is hair,

1834
01:31:07,889 --> 01:31:10,722
- but it's very thin hair.
- I know, I know!

1835
01:31:10,759 --> 01:31:12,420
Just trace
with your finger

1836
01:31:12,460 --> 01:31:14,894
- the actual area.
- You're actually asking me to do that?

1837
01:31:14,929 --> 01:31:16,920
- Fuckin' hell, mate.
- Just trace the area.

1838
01:31:16,965 --> 01:31:18,796
All right,
I'll just trace it,

1839
01:31:18,833 --> 01:31:21,233
from like that.
I'm just tickling the area.

1840
01:31:21,269 --> 01:31:23,533
Oh, I can feel that.
That's good.

1841
01:31:23,571 --> 01:31:25,334
Can you arrange the hair
that's there

1842
01:31:25,373 --> 01:31:27,136
- to cover it?
- No no no!

1843
01:31:27,175 --> 01:31:28,767
'Cause I'm working
in the dark.

1844
01:31:28,810 --> 01:31:31,278
Well, I'm not going to talk to
your fucking head, Rob.

1845
01:31:31,312 --> 01:31:33,610
Did I do more
Al Pacino

1846
01:31:33,648 --> 01:31:35,741
in the car scene?

1847
01:31:35,784 --> 01:31:37,945
- I remember.
- You did a lot more.

1848
01:31:37,986 --> 01:31:39,510
You remember me
doing a lot more?

1849
01:31:39,554 --> 01:31:42,352
- I have to say I'm...
- Sad to see it go.

1850
01:31:42,390 --> 01:31:45,826
It served as a counterpoint
to the stuff Naomie was doing.

1851
01:31:45,860 --> 01:31:48,522
- It did?
- I'm in the dark.

1852
01:31:48,563 --> 01:31:52,465
I do a good Al.
"Shylock is my name."

1853
01:31:52,500 --> 01:31:54,968
- Did you see him in that?
- Yeah.

1854
01:31:55,003 --> 01:31:57,062
I do a good
Al Pacino too,

1855
01:31:57,105 --> 01:31:59,369
but I don't do it in front of people
all the time.

1856
01:31:59,407 --> 01:32:01,136
Because you don't have
the confidence.

1857
01:32:01,176 --> 01:32:02,871
- I understand.
- I do.

1858
01:32:02,911 --> 01:32:05,402
- I feel I can get up there and do it.
- I can do Al Pacino.

1859
01:32:05,446 --> 01:32:07,971
I can do like Al Pacino
in "The Godfather."

1860
01:32:08,016 --> 01:32:10,211
That wasn't great.
My friend...

1861
01:32:10,251 --> 01:32:12,242
When the Godfather
speaks like this,

1862
01:32:12,287 --> 01:32:13,879
"You disrespect
the family."

1863
01:32:13,922 --> 01:32:16,447
- The Godfather talks like this.
- The Godfather speaks like that.

1864
01:32:16,491 --> 01:32:19,460
You have no depth
to the way you speak.

1865
01:32:19,494 --> 01:32:22,190
Because there was no depth
in those days, in those days...

1866
01:32:22,230 --> 01:32:24,562
You know, you sound
like a cartoon now.

1867
01:32:25,633 --> 01:32:27,897
That's not what I'm doing.

1868
01:32:27,936 --> 01:32:29,597
- With respect...
- The Godfather...

1869
01:32:29,637 --> 01:32:32,970
- Let me do Pacino.
- That's the way I do Pacino.

1870
01:32:33,007 --> 01:32:36,306
- Just let me do Pacino.
- That's the way. I was fucking loud!

1871
01:32:36,344 --> 01:32:38,778
Like that!
It's real fucking loud!

1872
01:32:38,813 --> 01:32:42,340
A big sound like that
all the fucking time.

1873
01:32:42,383 --> 01:32:44,943
That's Columbo.
L-l-l-l... I'm very open.

1874
01:32:44,986 --> 01:32:48,251
I model myself on Pacino.
You can see it on the screen.

1875
01:32:48,289 --> 01:32:50,757
You see it, in fact,
when I lean against a wall.

1876
01:32:50,792 --> 01:32:52,487
Tha... that's Pacino.

1877
01:32:52,527 --> 01:32:54,893
When I do a look of shock,

1878
01:32:54,929 --> 01:32:57,727
that's Pacino.

1879
01:32:57,765 --> 01:33:00,666
Are you being serious now
or are you joking?

1880
01:33:00,702 --> 01:33:02,693
We're in the same business.

1881
01:33:02,737 --> 01:33:05,035
I'm not showy.
That's the last thing I am.

1882
01:33:05,073 --> 01:33:07,598
I look for truth, and that's why
I go to Pacino,

1883
01:33:07,642 --> 01:33:09,507
that's why
I go to Hopkins.

1884
01:33:09,544 --> 01:33:11,512
But no, I go
to actresses as well.

1885
01:33:11,546 --> 01:33:14,106
I go to Streisand.

1886
01:33:14,148 --> 01:33:18,380
I go to Streisand.
I regularly go to Streisand.

1887
01:33:18,419 --> 01:33:20,614
I say,
"What can you give me?"

1888
01:33:20,655 --> 01:33:23,522
And I look at
her body... of work,

1889
01:33:23,558 --> 01:33:25,617
so I have a little bit
from "Hello, Dolly!"

1890
01:33:25,660 --> 01:33:27,890
I'm going to take
a little bit from "Yentl,"

1891
01:33:27,929 --> 01:33:30,727
and put them together,
a whole...

1892
01:33:30,765 --> 01:33:33,825
she would say in Jewish,
and off I go.

1893
01:33:33,868 --> 01:33:36,564
So I've got Streisand
underneath me,

1894
01:33:36,604 --> 01:33:38,799
I've got Hopkins,
I've got Pacino.

1895
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:41,331
You tell me
where I can't go.

1896
01:33:44,579 --> 01:33:48,037
What do you think?
I've had them done.

1897
01:33:48,082 --> 01:33:50,175
- I know you have.
- What do you think?

1898
01:33:50,218 --> 01:33:52,812
Feel that one.
Look, no crevasse.

1899
01:33:52,854 --> 01:33:54,913
- Feel it.
- Don't ask me to feel your teeth.

1900
01:33:54,956 --> 01:33:57,049
- Just close your eyes and feel it.
- No.

1901
01:33:57,091 --> 01:33:59,286
It's your
fucking teeth. Christ.

1902
01:33:59,327 --> 01:34:02,888
You've got a thing about... whenever
there's a hint of something gay...

1903
01:34:02,931 --> 01:34:05,525
What? This has nothing to do
with "gay."

1904
01:34:05,566 --> 01:34:08,228
That's what it is. You don't want
to touch another man's teeth

1905
01:34:08,269 --> 01:34:11,932
because you're worried you might
be attracted to me. Just touch my teeth.

1906
01:34:11,973 --> 01:34:15,306
- It's good, it's good, it's good.
- Thank you. Thank you.
