2
00:00:52,723 --> 00:00:54,987
We got issue in America.

3
00:00:55,058 --> 00:00:57,993
Too many good docs
are getting out of business.

4
00:00:58,061 --> 00:01:03,658
Too many ob-gyns aren't able to practice
their love with women across this country.

5
00:01:11,642 --> 00:01:16,841
I don't have a job. I don't want to have
any more debt out to anybody else.

6
00:01:16,914 --> 00:01:19,007
I'm flushing the wound.

7
00:01:19,616 --> 00:01:22,107
<i>This is Adam.</i>

8
00:01:34,298 --> 00:01:36,789
<i>He had an accident.</i>

9
00:01:47,811 --> 00:01:53,613
<i>He's one of nearly 50 million Americans
with no health insurance.</i>

10
00:02:06,029 --> 00:02:08,623
<i>But this film isn't about Adam.</i>

11
00:02:12,836 --> 00:02:16,328
So this is the table saw.
It was spinning that way...

12
00:02:16,406 --> 00:02:18,397
<i>This is Rick.</i>

13
00:02:21,712 --> 00:02:25,113
I was gripping a piece of wood
and I grabbed it here and it hit a knot...

14
00:02:25,182 --> 00:02:29,482
<i>He sawed off the tops
of to of his fingers.</i>

15
00:02:29,553 --> 00:02:31,714
...and it was that quick.

16
00:02:34,191 --> 00:02:37,217
<i>- His first thought?
- I don't have insurance.</i>

17
00:02:37,294 --> 00:02:40,559
Am I gonna have to pay cash for this?
$ 2,000, $3,000 or more?

18
00:02:40,631 --> 00:02:43,930
Does that mean
we're not gonna get a car?

19
00:02:45,068 --> 00:02:47,662
<i>Rick also doesn't have
health coverage.</i>

20
00:02:47,738 --> 00:02:50,002
<i>So the hospital gave him a choice.</i>

21
00:02:50,073 --> 00:02:53,804
<i>Reattach the middle finger for $60.000.</i>

22
00:02:53,877 --> 00:02:57,369
<i>Or do the ring finger for 12.000.</i>

23
00:02:57,447 --> 00:03:02,714
It's an awful feeling
to just try to put a value on your body.

24
00:03:07,157 --> 00:03:11,321
<i>Being a hopeless romantic.
Rick chose the ring finger.</i>

25
00:03:11,395 --> 00:03:14,330
<i>For the bargain price of 12 grand.</i>

26
00:03:14,398 --> 00:03:20,303
<i>The top of his middle finger now enjoys
its new home in an Oregon landfill.</i>

27
00:03:27,778 --> 00:03:32,647
I can do that thing where, you know,
the old man used to pull the finger off.

28
00:03:38,121 --> 00:03:41,420
<i>This movie
isn't about Rick either.</i>

29
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:45,621
<i>Yes. There are nearly 50 million Americans
with no health insurance.</i>

30
00:03:45,696 --> 00:03:48,324
<i>They pray every day
they don't get sick.</i>

31
00:03:48,398 --> 00:03:51,390
<i>Because 18.000 of them
will die this year.</i>

32
00:03:51,468 --> 00:03:53,959
<i>Simply because they're uninsured.</i>

33
00:03:56,139 --> 00:03:58,767
<i>But this movie isn't about them.</i>

34
00:03:58,842 --> 00:04:03,939
<i>It's about the 250 million of you
who have health insurance.</i>

35
00:04:04,014 --> 00:04:08,246
<i>Those of you who are living
the American Dream.</i>

36
00:04:18,128 --> 00:04:23,122
<i>It's moving day
for Larry and Donna Smith.</i>

37
00:04:27,237 --> 00:04:31,765
<i>They've packed everything they own
in these to cars.</i>

38
00:04:33,176 --> 00:04:36,873
<i>And are driving to Denver. Colorado.</i>

39
00:04:37,881 --> 00:04:40,179
<i>To their new home...</i>

40
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,241
- Hi.
- Hello.

41
00:04:43,253 --> 00:04:45,414
<i>...in their daughter's storage room.</i>

42
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:47,684
This is home, sweet home.

43
00:04:49,559 --> 00:04:53,427
- Look at all that stuff.
- We'll get everything organized.

44
00:04:53,497 --> 00:04:56,125
- We will.
- What do we do with the computer?

45
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,360
- It stays.
- It stays there.

46
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:04,004
So this is where Heather talked about
we might have to put bunk beds.

47
00:05:04,074 --> 00:05:06,907
I see what she's talking about.

48
00:05:07,844 --> 00:05:12,304
<i>It wasn't supposed to
end up like this for Larry and Donna.</i>

49
00:05:12,382 --> 00:05:14,748
<i>They both had good jobs.</i>

50
00:05:15,752 --> 00:05:18,550
<i>She was a newspaper editor.</i>

51
00:05:18,622 --> 00:05:21,216
<i>And he was a union machinist.</i>

52
00:05:22,025 --> 00:05:28,453
<i>They raised six kids who all went to
fine schools like the University of Chicago.</i>

53
00:05:28,532 --> 00:05:31,194
<i>But Larry had a heart attack.</i>

54
00:05:31,268 --> 00:05:33,634
<i>And then another one.</i>

55
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:36,031
<i>And then another one.</i>

56
00:05:37,441 --> 00:05:39,932
<i>And then Donna got cancer.</i>

57
00:05:41,712 --> 00:05:44,306
<i>And even though
they had health insurance.</i>

58
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:48,010
<i>The copays and deductibles
soon added up</i>

59
00:05:48,085 --> 00:05:52,078
<i>to the point where they could no longer
afford to keep their home.</i>

60
00:05:52,155 --> 00:05:56,785
If somebody told me ten years ago this was
gonna happen to us because of healthcare,

61
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,260
I would have said, "It's not possible. "

62
00:05:59,329 --> 00:06:04,858
"Not in the United States.
We wouldn't let that happen to people. "

63
00:06:08,705 --> 00:06:11,196
<i>- Are we gonna quit?
- No.</i>

64
00:06:12,109 --> 00:06:14,100
It's just hard.

65
00:06:14,911 --> 00:06:17,778
<i>They were bankrupt.</i>

66
00:06:17,848 --> 00:06:20,373
<i>So they moved in
with their daughter.</i>

67
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,850
We'll get it all figured out.

68
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,711
We emptied the dresser
so you have a spot.

69
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:27,654
Nice, very nice.

70
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:33,788
<i>Even their son Danny
popped in from across town</i>

71
00:06:33,864 --> 00:06:36,059
<i>to welcome them to Denver.</i>

72
00:06:36,133 --> 00:06:39,762
- What do we do about people like you?
- I don't know, that's a good question.

73
00:06:39,836 --> 00:06:44,773
You're supposed to pay a deductible for
$9,000, I understand. That's healthcare.

74
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:47,810
What about people like Kathy and I
that have to come up there

75
00:06:47,878 --> 00:06:50,972
and move you every five years,
every two years, every year,

76
00:06:51,047 --> 00:06:54,414
- 'cause you don't have enough money?
- That's what Russell says too.

77
00:06:54,484 --> 00:06:58,420
I'm sorry. It's not what we wanted
to have happen in life.

78
00:06:58,488 --> 00:07:01,423
And we're doing what we can
to make the change.

79
00:07:01,491 --> 00:07:06,360
You don't know what that feels like inside
at 50-some years old,

80
00:07:06,429 --> 00:07:09,990
to have to reach out
to my 20-something-year-old for help.

81
00:07:10,066 --> 00:07:14,969
It's gonna be hard for four, five, six,
seven months, it's gonna be hard.

82
00:07:15,038 --> 00:07:21,170
I have a feeling of you bring your problems
with you no matter where you go.

83
00:07:21,244 --> 00:07:23,474
Yeah.

84
00:07:23,547 --> 00:07:26,038
But I don't know
what to do about that.

85
00:07:30,887 --> 00:07:34,050
<i>By sheer coincidence.
Their daughter's husband. Paul.</i>

86
00:07:34,124 --> 00:07:38,356
<i>Was leaving on a job
the very same day they arrived.</i>

87
00:07:40,163 --> 00:07:43,997
<i>Paul was a contractor.
But there weren't many jobs lately.</i>

88
00:07:44,067 --> 00:07:46,297
<i>So he found work out of town.</i>

89
00:07:46,369 --> 00:07:50,328
I'm sure you'll keep
a telephone conversation.

90
00:07:50,407 --> 00:07:52,398
Email you.

91
00:07:56,813 --> 00:08:00,579
<i>You're gonna be
just fine, lovies.</i>

92
00:08:04,187 --> 00:08:06,178
Weird situation, isn't it?

93
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,789
<i>- Tell me where Daddy's going.
- Iraq.</i>

94
00:08:14,598 --> 00:08:16,862
Why is Daddy going to Iraq?

95
00:08:16,933 --> 00:08:19,094
To do some plumbing.

96
00:08:24,641 --> 00:08:26,939
Oh, boy.

97
00:08:28,345 --> 00:08:33,044
This I do early in the morning.
The first thing I do is I clean here.

98
00:08:34,985 --> 00:08:40,252
<i>At age 79. Frank Cardile should
be kicking back on a beach somewhere.</i>

99
00:08:40,323 --> 00:08:43,417
<i>But even though
he's insured by Medicare.</i>

100
00:08:43,493 --> 00:08:49,022
<i>It doesn't cover all the cost of the drugs
that he and his wife need.</i>

101
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:55,931
<i>Being that I'm an employee here,
my medicine is for free.</i>

102
00:08:56,006 --> 00:09:01,342
So that's why I gotta keep working.
Until I die.

103
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:03,777
There is nothing wrong with that.

104
00:09:03,847 --> 00:09:05,644
OK.

105
00:09:05,715 --> 00:09:09,549
I always gotta keep my ears open
because there's always spillages.

106
00:09:09,619 --> 00:09:12,281
Sometimes you get a gallon of milk.

107
00:09:12,355 --> 00:09:18,760
Tomato sauce - oh, you're in trouble.
It'll take a half-hour to clean that up.

108
00:09:18,828 --> 00:09:21,490
And I look up on every aisle
so as everything is clean.

109
00:09:21,564 --> 00:09:26,331
If I see something I pick it up,
whether it's paper or garbage.

110
00:09:27,771 --> 00:09:31,832
One day I had the keys in my hand
and they went in there.

111
00:09:31,908 --> 00:09:35,241
And I had to climb in there
to get the keys out.

112
00:09:38,748 --> 00:09:41,512
It's a sad situation.

113
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:47,755
If there are golden years,
I can't find 'em, I'll tell you that.

114
00:09:50,093 --> 00:09:52,459
She had a painkiller for her hip.

115
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:57,262
The girl said, "Frank, this is $ 213."
"What, for a painkiller?"

116
00:09:57,334 --> 00:10:01,361
- I didn't take it.
- I backed off. I said, "I gotta come back. "

117
00:10:01,438 --> 00:10:05,135
What's in them? What's in these
new drugs that they distribute?

118
00:10:05,208 --> 00:10:07,972
I don't believe you need
half of the things they tell you.

119
00:10:08,044 --> 00:10:12,242
I have never taken medication now,
as I'm getting older.

120
00:10:12,315 --> 00:10:14,647
I don't even like to take an aspirin.

121
00:10:14,718 --> 00:10:16,879
I do like a little brandy.

122
00:10:22,092 --> 00:10:27,758
I don't really know how this happened, but
the trunk came forward into the back seat.

123
00:10:27,831 --> 00:10:32,791
<i>Laura Burnham was in a head-on
collision that knocked her out cold.</i>

124
00:10:32,869 --> 00:10:37,499
<i>Paramedics got her out of the car and into
an ambulance for a trip to the hospital.</i>

125
00:10:37,574 --> 00:10:40,475
I get a bill from my insurance company

126
00:10:40,543 --> 00:10:44,343
telling me that the ambulance ride
was not going to be paid for,

127
00:10:44,414 --> 00:10:46,882
because it wasn't preapproved.

128
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,545
I don't know exactly when I was supposed
to preapprove it, you know?

129
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:55,751
Like after I gain consciousness in the car,
before I got in the ambulance?

130
00:10:55,825 --> 00:11:00,421
I should have grabbed my cellphone
off the street and called in the ambulance?

131
00:11:00,497 --> 00:11:03,330
I mean, it's just crazy.

132
00:11:07,537 --> 00:11:10,131
<i>I applied for
HealthNet insurance for Jason.</i>

133
00:11:10,206 --> 00:11:14,142
They rejected him
because of his height and weight.

134
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:17,441
Jason is six feet tall
and 130 pounds.

135
00:11:21,418 --> 00:11:24,546
I applied for healthcare
through BlueCross BlueShield

136
00:11:24,621 --> 00:11:28,250
and they told me
that my body mass index was too high.

137
00:11:28,792 --> 00:11:31,454
I'm 5' 1 ",
I weigh 175 pounds.

138
00:11:35,632 --> 00:11:40,569
<i>I always thought health insurance
companies were there to help us.</i>

139
00:11:40,637 --> 00:11:42,901
<i>So I posted a note on the internet.</i>

140
00:11:42,972 --> 00:11:45,839
<i>Asking people if they had had
any similar stories</i>

141
00:11:45,909 --> 00:11:49,072
<i>about problems
with their insurance company.</i>

142
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:55,279
<i>Within 24 hours.
I had over 3700 responses.</i>

143
00:11:55,351 --> 00:11:58,718
<i>And by the end of the week.
Over 25.000 people</i>

144
00:11:58,788 --> 00:12:03,088
<i>had sent me
their healthcare horror stories.</i>

145
00:12:03,626 --> 00:12:07,756
<i>Some of them decided
not to wait for me to get back to them.</i>

146
00:12:07,831 --> 00:12:13,394
<i>Like Doug Noe. Who took matters into
his own hands. Without my permission.</i>

147
00:12:14,838 --> 00:12:19,639
<i>His daughter was nine months old when
they discovered she was going deaf.</i>

148
00:12:19,709 --> 00:12:22,007
<i>His health insurance company.
CIGNA.</i>

149
00:12:22,078 --> 00:12:25,377
<i>Said they'd pay for an implant
in only one of her ears.</i>

150
00:12:25,448 --> 00:12:27,507
<i>According to the letter they sent.</i>

151
00:12:27,584 --> 00:12:31,418
<i>It's experimental
for her to hear in to ears.</i>

152
00:12:31,488 --> 00:12:34,980
If a cochlear implant
is good for one ear,

153
00:12:35,058 --> 00:12:39,051
it doesn't even make any sense that
it wouldn't be good for the second ear.

154
00:12:39,129 --> 00:12:42,792
Especially when a child
is just starting to learn how to talk,

155
00:12:42,866 --> 00:12:46,461
she has to learn
from both sides of her head.

156
00:12:48,471 --> 00:12:51,304
<i>That's when he sat down
to write CIGNA a letter.</i>

157
00:12:51,374 --> 00:12:55,037
This is to CIGNA.
"Noted filmmaker Michael Moore

158
00:12:55,111 --> 00:12:58,171
is in the process of gathering information
for his next film. "

159
00:12:58,248 --> 00:13:02,617
"I've sent information concerning CIGNA's
lack of caring for its policy holders. "

160
00:13:02,685 --> 00:13:06,086
"Has your CEO ever been
in a film before?"

161
00:13:07,524 --> 00:13:12,860
<i>Before he knew it. He received
a call on his voice mail from CIGNA.</i>

162
00:13:12,929 --> 00:13:15,898
<i>Tuesday. 8.:54 am.</i>

163
00:13:35,685 --> 00:13:41,146
Obviously all this worked because Annette
is going to get her second implant in July.

164
00:13:41,224 --> 00:13:43,556
<i>"Dear Mike.
I work in the industry. "</i>

165
00:13:43,626 --> 00:13:45,321
<i>"I work for an HMO."</i>

166
00:13:45,395 --> 00:13:48,796
<i>I started to get hundreds of letters
of a different sort</i>

167
00:13:48,865 --> 00:13:52,323
<i>from people who work inside
the healthcare industry.</i>

168
00:13:52,402 --> 00:13:56,634
<i>They'd seen everything
and they were fed up with it.</i>

169
00:13:56,706 --> 00:13:59,971
<i>"Health insurance
companies suck. Flat suck. "</i>

170
00:14:00,043 --> 00:14:04,537
<i>Like Becky Malke. Who was
in charge of keeping sick people away</i>

171
00:14:04,614 --> 00:14:07,412
<i>from one of America's
top insurance companies.</i>

172
00:14:07,483 --> 00:14:11,783
<i>I work in a call center, so people
call in and ask for insurance quotes.</i>

173
00:14:11,854 --> 00:14:15,722
There are certain preexisting conditions,
basically industry-wide,

174
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:17,453
that will not be covered -

175
00:14:17,527 --> 00:14:21,588
diabetes, heart disease,
certain forms of cancer.

176
00:14:21,664 --> 00:14:26,294
If you have these conditions, you are likely
not going to get your health insurance.

177
00:14:26,369 --> 00:14:29,861
<i>How long is this list of conditions
that make you ineligible?</i>

178
00:14:29,939 --> 00:14:34,239
It would be a really long list.
It would be a long list.

179
00:14:34,310 --> 00:14:36,972
It could wrap around this house.

180
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:06,507
Sometimes you know they're gonna
be declined at the end of the application,

181
00:15:06,576 --> 00:15:11,639
and they're like...
God, like one time I had a couple,

182
00:15:11,714 --> 00:15:13,944
and they were so happy to get...
I'm gonna cry.

183
00:15:14,017 --> 00:15:19,148
They were so happy that they were...
I took them through this application.

184
00:15:19,222 --> 00:15:22,680
And the husband was late for work.

185
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:26,388
And the wife said to him,
"Don't worry, baby, it's gonna be OK."

186
00:15:26,462 --> 00:15:28,521
"We have health insurance now. "

187
00:15:28,598 --> 00:15:31,726
And when I looked, I could tell
they were gonna get declined

188
00:15:31,801 --> 00:15:35,237
because of their health conditions.
And they were so happy.

189
00:15:35,305 --> 00:15:38,365
I thought, "God, they're gonna get
that call in a couple of weeks

190
00:15:38,441 --> 00:15:43,003
telling them
that they're not eligible for insurance. "

191
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,445
I just felt so bad
'cause I just really thought

192
00:15:45,515 --> 00:15:48,780
and I knew
and I couldn't say anything to them.

193
00:15:49,252 --> 00:15:51,243
I just felt like crap.

194
00:15:51,321 --> 00:15:53,755
That's why I'm such a bitch
on the phone to people,

195
00:15:53,823 --> 00:15:56,485
because I don't wanna
get to know them,

196
00:15:56,559 --> 00:15:59,790
I don't wanna know about their lives,
I just wanna get in and out,

197
00:15:59,862 --> 00:16:04,492
and get done with it
'cause I can't take the stress of it.

198
00:16:04,567 --> 00:16:08,367
<i>In spite of Becky being
a bit of a pain on the phone.</i>

199
00:16:08,438 --> 00:16:14,172
<i>A quarter billion Americans
are still able to get health insurance.</i>

200
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:20,475
<i>Let's meet some of these
happy insured customers.</i>

201
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:22,541
<i>Maria has BlueShield.</i>

202
00:16:22,618 --> 00:16:24,848
<i>And Diane. Horizon BlueCross.</i>

203
00:16:25,388 --> 00:16:27,481
<i>BCS insures Laurel.</i>

204
00:16:27,557 --> 00:16:30,822
<i>And Caroline has CIGNA.</i>

205
00:16:30,893 --> 00:16:33,862
<i>And it's a good thing
that they're all fully covered.</i>

206
00:16:33,930 --> 00:16:37,491
I ended up being diagnosed
with retroperitoneal cancer.

207
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:39,364
- Brain tumor.
- Breast cancer.

208
00:16:39,435 --> 00:16:41,335
Brain tumor on the right temporal lobe.

209
00:16:41,404 --> 00:16:46,068
<i>As they were insured. They got the
red-carpet treatment at the doctor's office.</i>

210
00:16:46,142 --> 00:16:50,169
She requested for me
to see a neurologist.

211
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:52,339
The way they would treat it
was to remove it.

212
00:16:52,415 --> 00:16:54,280
Surgery was scheduled
for December 9.

213
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:56,750
There is a test that you can take

214
00:16:56,819 --> 00:17:01,779
that will show whether or not
you would benefit from chemo.

215
00:17:01,858 --> 00:17:06,261
<i>They got their treatment. But not
before battling their insurance companies.</i>

216
00:17:06,329 --> 00:17:09,355
Investigated whether or not
this was a preexisting condition.

217
00:17:09,432 --> 00:17:11,263
"It's not medically necessary. "

218
00:17:11,334 --> 00:17:13,359
They claim that it's experimental.

219
00:17:13,436 --> 00:17:15,734
"We don't consider that life-threatening. "

220
00:17:15,805 --> 00:17:19,206
<i>Diane died
from her non life-threatening tumor.</i>

221
00:17:19,275 --> 00:17:22,301
<i>Laurel's cancer is now spread
throughout her body.</i>

222
00:17:22,378 --> 00:17:26,747
<i>Her "experimental test"
proved that Caroline needed chemo.</i>

223
00:17:26,816 --> 00:17:30,047
<i>While vacationing in Japan.
Maria became ill</i>

224
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:35,648
<i>and got the MRI that BlueShield
of California had refused to approve.</i>

225
00:17:35,725 --> 00:17:39,024
<i>The doctors in Japan
told her she had a brain tumor.</i>

226
00:17:39,729 --> 00:17:43,062
<i>BlueShield had said repeatedly
she didn't have a tumor.</i>

227
00:17:43,132 --> 00:17:48,331
<i>That's when she said:
"Well. I'm pretty sure I have a lawyer. "</i>

228
00:17:49,572 --> 00:17:52,666
<i>March 13, 2003.</i>

229
00:17:52,742 --> 00:17:55,939
I'm gonna direct your attention
to exhibit one.

230
00:17:56,012 --> 00:17:58,537
Please describe for me what it is.

231
00:17:58,614 --> 00:18:05,213
It is a denial for referral
to an ophthalmologist.

232
00:18:05,288 --> 00:18:08,519
<i>- Is it your signature on this?
- Yes.</i>

233
00:18:08,591 --> 00:18:11,617
<i>I'd like to direct your attention
to exhibit two.</i>

234
00:18:11,694 --> 00:18:16,131
This is a denial
of a request for referral

235
00:18:16,199 --> 00:18:19,930
for a magnetic resonance imaging test
of the brain.

236
00:18:20,002 --> 00:18:22,027
<i>- It has your signature?
- Yes.</i>

237
00:18:22,104 --> 00:18:26,200
<i>Directing your attention
to exhibit three. Please read this document.</i>

238
00:18:26,275 --> 00:18:32,407
This is a denial of a referral
to a neurosurgeon.

239
00:18:32,482 --> 00:18:38,387
<i>Can you explain for me
how you came to sign the denial letter?</i>

240
00:18:38,454 --> 00:18:41,389
This is a standard signature
put on all denial letters.

241
00:18:41,457 --> 00:18:45,018
<i>- Is it your signature or a stamp?
- That is a stamp.</i>

242
00:18:45,094 --> 00:18:51,863
<i>Did you ever see a denial letter
before your signature was stamped on it?</i>

243
00:18:51,934 --> 00:18:56,428
No, but the denial letters
are fundamentally the same.

244
00:18:56,506 --> 00:18:59,100
The denial letters that are sent out...

245
00:18:59,175 --> 00:19:02,338
<i>- The answer is no.
- No. All right.</i>

246
00:19:03,145 --> 00:19:07,912
The definition of a good director was
somebody who saves the company money.

247
00:19:07,984 --> 00:19:12,284
<i>Dr. Linda Peeno
was a medical reviewer for Humana.</i>

248
00:19:12,355 --> 00:19:16,519
<i>She left her job because she didn't like
their way of doing business.</i>

249
00:19:16,592 --> 00:19:20,460
<i>I was told when I started
that I had to keep a 10% denial.</i>

250
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:25,331
Then they were giving us reports weekly
that would have all the cases we reviewed,

251
00:19:25,401 --> 00:19:27,665
the percent approved
and the percent denied.

252
00:19:27,737 --> 00:19:30,570
And our actual percentage denial rate.

253
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:35,202
Then there would be another report that
compared me to all the other reviewers.

254
00:19:35,278 --> 00:19:38,839
The doctor with the highest percent
of denials was gonna get a bonus.

255
00:19:38,915 --> 00:19:42,407
<i>Really? So you, as a doctor,
working for the HMO,</i>

256
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:45,852
if you denied more people healthcare,
you got a bonus?

257
00:19:45,922 --> 00:19:47,856
<i>That was how they set it up.</i>

258
00:19:47,924 --> 00:19:52,156
Any payment for a claim
is referred to as a medical loss.

259
00:19:52,228 --> 00:19:54,628
That's the terminology
the industry uses.

260
00:19:54,697 --> 00:19:58,360
I mean, when you don't spend money
on somebody, you deny their care,

261
00:19:58,434 --> 00:20:02,768
or you make a decision that brings
money in and you don't have to spend it,

262
00:20:02,838 --> 00:20:05,329
it's a savings to the company.

263
00:20:07,243 --> 00:20:09,711
<i>This is Tarsha Harris.</i>

264
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:12,111
<i>BlueCross didn't deny her
her treatment.</i>

265
00:20:12,181 --> 00:20:15,378
<i>And actually approved her operation.</i>

266
00:20:16,686 --> 00:20:20,486
<i>But then they discovered
that in the distant past.</i>

267
00:20:20,556 --> 00:20:23,787
<i>She had had a yeast infection.</i>

268
00:20:26,128 --> 00:20:30,064
Apparently it's common.
Men, women can get a yeast infection.

269
00:20:30,132 --> 00:20:36,662
So I was prescribed the yeast infection
cream, general cream, and it went away.

270
00:20:37,473 --> 00:20:39,464
She later applied for health insurance

271
00:20:39,542 --> 00:20:43,672
and that's what you're supposed
to be disclosing - serious ailments.

272
00:20:43,746 --> 00:20:49,207
The yeast infection is not a serious ailment.
There was nothing she could have done.

273
00:20:49,285 --> 00:20:52,880
It wasn't until they were gonna have
to spend money that they looked.

274
00:20:52,955 --> 00:20:56,482
If they'd taken five minutes
and wanted to clear up the yeast infection,

275
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,585
they could've looked at her records
or talked to her doctor.

276
00:20:59,662 --> 00:21:02,859
<i>Because of the undisclosed
yeast infection.</i>

277
00:21:02,932 --> 00:21:05,526
<i>BlueCross dropped Tarsha Harris.</i>

278
00:21:05,601 --> 00:21:10,197
She thinks she's put this behind her.
And then BlueCross changes their mind,

279
00:21:10,272 --> 00:21:15,107
tells the doctors, "We're taking the money
back, go get the money from Tarsha. "

280
00:21:15,177 --> 00:21:21,138
The fact of the matter is
it was a yeast infection, that's all it was.

281
00:21:21,217 --> 00:21:24,812
I'm still a little bitter because
I don't trust insurance companies now.

282
00:21:24,887 --> 00:21:29,153
To me, it seems they're always
gonna be looking for a way out.

283
00:21:29,225 --> 00:21:31,693
What happened to helping
the person that's sick?

284
00:21:31,761 --> 00:21:34,457
Don't make their problems worse.

285
00:21:35,998 --> 00:21:38,330
<i>This is Lee Einer.</i>

286
00:21:38,401 --> 00:21:42,303
<i>If they weren't able to weed you out
in the application process.</i>

287
00:21:42,371 --> 00:21:45,772
<i>Or deny you the care
your doctor said you needed.</i>

288
00:21:45,841 --> 00:21:49,333
<i>And somehow ended up
paying for the operation.</i>

289
00:21:50,212 --> 00:21:53,306
<i>They send in Lee. Their hitman.</i>

290
00:21:53,382 --> 00:21:58,251
<i>His job is to get the company's money
back any way he can.</i>

291
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:02,620
<i>All he has to do
is find one slip-up on your application.</i>

292
00:22:02,692 --> 00:22:06,526
<i>Or a preexisting condition
you didn't know you had.</i>

293
00:22:06,595 --> 00:22:10,326
We're gonna go after this
like it's a murder case.

294
00:22:10,399 --> 00:22:12,959
And I mean the whole unit dedicated to

295
00:22:13,035 --> 00:22:16,971
going through your health history
for the last five years,

296
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,769
looking for anything that would indicate

297
00:22:19,842 --> 00:22:23,573
that you concealed something,
you misrepresented something,

298
00:22:23,646 --> 00:22:26,376
so that they can cancel the policy

299
00:22:26,449 --> 00:22:29,885
or jack the rates so high
that you can't pay them.

300
00:22:31,087 --> 00:22:35,217
And if we couldn't find anything
you didn't disclose on the application,

301
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:39,250
you can still get hit
with a preexisting denial,

302
00:22:39,328 --> 00:22:42,991
because you don't even have to have
sought medical treatment for it.

303
00:22:43,065 --> 00:22:47,968
In some states, it's legal to have
a prudent person preexisting condition.

304
00:22:48,037 --> 00:22:50,062
And that's a mouthful, I know,

305
00:22:50,139 --> 00:22:54,337
but what that says is
if prior to your insurance kicking in,

306
00:22:54,410 --> 00:23:00,212
you had any symptom which would incline
a normally prudent person

307
00:23:00,282 --> 00:23:03,251
to have sought medical care,

308
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:09,485
then the condition of which that symptom
was a symptom is excluded.

309
00:23:12,762 --> 00:23:14,593
I know!

310
00:23:15,364 --> 00:23:19,095
It's labyrinthine, isn't it?
But that's how it works.

311
00:23:19,668 --> 00:23:21,727
They're supposed to be even-handed,

312
00:23:21,804 --> 00:23:25,399
but with an insurance company,
it's their frigging money!

313
00:23:25,474 --> 00:23:29,911
So it's not unintentional,
it's not a mistake,

314
00:23:29,979 --> 00:23:33,881
it's not an oversight,
you're not slipping through the cracks.

315
00:23:33,949 --> 00:23:38,579
Somebody made that crack
and swept you towards it.

316
00:23:38,654 --> 00:23:42,283
And the intent
is to maximize profits.

317
00:23:43,425 --> 00:23:46,656
Looking back,
I don't know that I killed anybody.

318
00:23:46,729 --> 00:23:49,254
Did I do harm in people's lives?

319
00:23:49,331 --> 00:23:51,993
Yeah. Hell, yeah.

320
00:23:54,804 --> 00:23:57,602
I haven't worked for insurance companies
for a long time,

321
00:23:57,673 --> 00:24:01,939
and I don't think
that really serves to atone

322
00:24:02,011 --> 00:24:06,175
for my participation in that mess.

323
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:10,241
I am glad I'm out of it, though.

324
00:24:13,389 --> 00:24:17,587
<i>Julie Pierce was struggling
to get care for her husband Tracy.</i>

325
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:21,027
<i>Who was suffering
from kidney cancer.</i>

326
00:24:21,096 --> 00:24:24,930
<i>Julie works in the intensive care unit
at St. Joseph's Medical Center</i>

327
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:27,264
<i>in Kansas City. Missouri.</i>

328
00:24:27,336 --> 00:24:30,271
<i>Which provided her family
with health insurance.</i>

329
00:24:30,339 --> 00:24:33,900
Every month, there was a new drug
that the doctor wanted to try.

330
00:24:33,976 --> 00:24:39,278
My insurance denied it. One letter
might say, "not a medical necessity,"

331
00:24:39,348 --> 00:24:44,411
one letter might say, "it's not
for this particular type of cancer,"

332
00:24:44,486 --> 00:24:47,011
and they denied it.

333
00:24:47,089 --> 00:24:51,389
Then we came up with the bone marrow.
It has showed to stop it,

334
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:54,896
sometimes to completely get rid of it.

335
00:24:54,964 --> 00:24:58,661
<i>Tracy's doctors said
this treatment had been successfully tried</i>

336
00:24:58,734 --> 00:25:01,066
<i>on many other patients.</i>

337
00:25:01,804 --> 00:25:05,604
<i>If one of Tracy's brothers turned out
to be a suitable donor.</i>

338
00:25:05,674 --> 00:25:12,045
<i>There were promising bone marrow
treatments for beating Tracy's cancer.</i>

339
00:25:12,114 --> 00:25:16,141
Two weeks later, the bone marrow
nurse at KU called me and she goes:

340
00:25:16,218 --> 00:25:21,178
"We've got the results back. His youngest
brother is a perfect donor match. "

341
00:25:21,257 --> 00:25:23,384
We were ecstatic.

342
00:25:23,459 --> 00:25:27,691
You know, I think that's the happiest
I had seen him...

343
00:25:30,032 --> 00:25:32,557
in a while.

344
00:25:32,635 --> 00:25:37,004
So we submitted it
and they denied it.

345
00:25:37,072 --> 00:25:39,097
Said it was "experimental. "

346
00:25:40,476 --> 00:25:44,503
So I found out that there is
a board of trustees over our medical plan

347
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,571
that actually work at my hospital.

348
00:25:46,649 --> 00:25:52,087
And they are the final decision-makers
on what gets approved and what doesn't.

349
00:25:52,154 --> 00:25:55,521
<i>Julie and her husband
and their son. Tracy Junior.</i>

350
00:25:55,591 --> 00:25:59,118
<i>Demanded a meeting
with the health plan's board of trustees.</i>

351
00:25:59,194 --> 00:26:03,130
<i>The very people
who had the power to approve their claim.</i>

352
00:26:03,198 --> 00:26:07,225
<i>They told Julie that they were
sympathetic to her situation.</i>

353
00:26:07,303 --> 00:26:11,262
I said, "Your sympathy does me no good
when I'm burying him next year. "

354
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:17,040
And I told them, I said if I was...
Bruce van Cleve was our CEO.

355
00:26:17,112 --> 00:26:23,210
I said, "I bet if it was Bruce van Cleve's
wife, it would get approved. "

356
00:26:23,285 --> 00:26:25,412
"No, it's nothing like that. "

357
00:26:25,487 --> 00:26:28,149
I said, "Or maybe
if my husband was white. "

358
00:26:28,223 --> 00:26:30,623
And I got up
and walked out of the room.

359
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:36,160
When we got home,
I found him up in the bathroom.

360
00:26:36,231 --> 00:26:41,635
And I knocked on the door and said,
"What are you doing in there?" "Nothing. "

361
00:26:41,704 --> 00:26:46,164
I opened the door 'cause usually he'll say:
"What do you think I'm doing in here?"

362
00:26:46,241 --> 00:26:49,938
And he was sitting in there
and he was crying.

363
00:26:51,046 --> 00:26:54,641
And he said, "Why me?
I'm a good person. "

364
00:26:55,217 --> 00:26:58,675
And I said,
"But we're not done fighting this. "

365
00:26:58,754 --> 00:27:03,214
"We're strong, yeah. "
And then he said...

366
00:27:03,292 --> 00:27:07,126
You know, he goes,
"I can see now that I'm gonna die. "

367
00:27:07,196 --> 00:27:13,328
He said, "I can leave everything,
but I don't want to leave you and Tracy. "

368
00:27:17,706 --> 00:27:21,335
The doctor told me
he would die in three weeks.

369
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,401
And...

370
00:27:24,947 --> 00:27:28,246
On January 13th,
which was my birthday,

371
00:27:29,118 --> 00:27:31,109
he went to sleep.

372
00:27:32,621 --> 00:27:35,715
And he died five days later,
here at home.

373
00:27:37,026 --> 00:27:39,517
He was my best friend.

374
00:27:40,396 --> 00:27:44,230
He was my soul mate.
He was my son's father.

375
00:27:46,535 --> 00:27:49,129
I mean, we were to grow old together.

376
00:27:50,472 --> 00:27:53,873
They took away
everything that matters.

377
00:27:56,245 --> 00:27:59,408
I wanna know why,
why my husband?

378
00:28:00,983 --> 00:28:04,180
Why wasn't he given
the chance to live?

379
00:28:05,587 --> 00:28:09,990
You preach these vision and values that
we care for the sick, the dying, the poor.

380
00:28:10,059 --> 00:28:13,893
That we're a healthcare
that leaves no one behind.

381
00:28:13,962 --> 00:28:18,126
You left him behind.
You didn't even give him a start.

382
00:28:19,268 --> 00:28:21,429
It was as if he was nothing.

383
00:28:22,905 --> 00:28:25,601
And I want them
to have a conscience about it.

384
00:28:25,674 --> 00:28:31,010
And I don't think they do.
I don't think it has fazed them one bit.

385
00:28:32,681 --> 00:28:34,672
At all.

386
00:28:37,252 --> 00:28:39,914
<i>There was one person
in the healthcare industry</i>

387
00:28:39,988 --> 00:28:42,081
<i>who did have a conscience.</i>

388
00:28:42,157 --> 00:28:47,254
<i>Dr. Linda Peeno.
A former medical reviewer at Humana.</i>

389
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:48,819
My name is Linda Peeno.

390
00:28:49,364 --> 00:28:53,733
I am here today
to make a public confession.

391
00:28:53,802 --> 00:28:58,205
In the spring of 1987,
as a physician,

392
00:28:58,273 --> 00:29:01,504
I denied a man
a necessary operation

393
00:29:01,577 --> 00:29:06,105
that would have saved his life,
and thus caused his death.

394
00:29:06,882 --> 00:29:10,477
No person and no group
has held me accountable for this,

395
00:29:10,552 --> 00:29:17,219
because, in fact, what I did was I saved
the company a half a million dollars for this.

396
00:29:17,292 --> 00:29:20,819
And, furthermore, this particular act
secured my reputation

397
00:29:20,896 --> 00:29:23,364
as a good medical director,

398
00:29:23,432 --> 00:29:27,493
and it insured my continued advancement
in the healthcare field.

399
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:31,562
I went from making a few hundred dollars
a week as a medical reviewer

400
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:36,771
to an escalating six-figure income
as a physician executive.

401
00:29:36,845 --> 00:29:42,613
In all my work, I had one primary duty,
and that was to use my medical expertise

402
00:29:42,684 --> 00:29:47,121
for the financial benefit
of the organization for which I worked.

403
00:29:47,189 --> 00:29:50,716
And I was told repeatedly
that I was not denying care,

404
00:29:50,792 --> 00:29:53,158
I was simply denying payment.

405
00:29:53,228 --> 00:29:56,493
I know how managed care
maims and kills patients.

406
00:29:56,565 --> 00:30:00,331
So I'm here to tell you
about the dirty work of managed care.

407
00:30:00,402 --> 00:30:02,996
And I'm haunted by the thousands
of pieces of paper

408
00:30:03,071 --> 00:30:06,302
on which I have written
that deadly word - "denied. "

409
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:07,672
Thank you.

410
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:16,508
<i>How did we get to the point
of doctors at health insurance companies</i>

411
00:30:16,585 --> 00:30:21,318
<i>actually being responsible
for the deaths of patients?</i>

412
00:30:22,624 --> 00:30:24,956
<i>Who invented this system?</i>

413
00:30:26,695 --> 00:30:28,686
<i>How did this all begin?</i>

414
00:30:31,633 --> 00:30:34,067
<i>Where did the HMO start?</i>

415
00:30:38,574 --> 00:30:42,601
<i>Thanks to the wonders of magnetic tape.
We know.</i>

416
00:31:44,573 --> 00:31:49,374
I am proposing today
a new national health strategy.

417
00:31:49,444 --> 00:31:52,504
The purpose of this program
is simply this -

418
00:31:52,581 --> 00:31:56,312
I want America to have
the finest healthcare in the world,

419
00:31:56,385 --> 00:32:02,119
and I want every American to be able
to have that care when he needs it.

420
00:32:03,525 --> 00:32:07,655
<i>The plan hatched
beteen Nixon and Edgar Kaiser worked.</i>

421
00:32:07,729 --> 00:32:11,790
<i>In the ensuing years.
Patients were given less and less care...</i>

422
00:32:11,867 --> 00:32:16,770
<i>Bigger logjams at the nearby
hospital and less quality medical care.</i>

423
00:32:16,838 --> 00:32:19,671
Been here about 18 hours,
since 7:00 this morning.

424
00:32:19,741 --> 00:32:23,700
<i>What looks cramped
and unsightly can also be dangerous.</i>

425
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:26,976
<i>...while health insurance
companies became wealthy.</i>

426
00:32:27,049 --> 00:32:29,108
<i>The system was broken.</i>

427
00:32:29,184 --> 00:32:33,348
37 million Americans are without protection
against catastrophic illness.

428
00:32:33,422 --> 00:32:37,791
<i>The losers are the poor.
Who may now postpone urgent healthcare</i>

429
00:32:37,859 --> 00:32:39,759
<i>until it's too late.</i>

430
00:32:39,828 --> 00:32:42,388
<i>This went on for years.</i>

431
00:32:42,464 --> 00:32:45,160
<i>Until this man rode into town.</i>

432
00:32:46,101 --> 00:32:48,626
<i>Bringing with him his little lady.</i>

433
00:32:55,243 --> 00:32:57,234
<i>Sassy.</i>

434
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,971
<i>Smart.</i>

435
00:33:03,985 --> 00:33:05,976
<i>Sexy.</i>

436
00:33:08,957 --> 00:33:11,357
<i>Some men couldn't handle it.</i>

437
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,558
Today I am announcing the formation

438
00:33:14,629 --> 00:33:17,928
of the President's Task Force
on National Health Reform,

439
00:33:17,999 --> 00:33:21,025
chaired by the First Lady,
Hillary Rodham Clinton.

440
00:33:21,103 --> 00:33:26,370
<i>Hillary Clinton decided to make
healthcare for everyone her top priority.</i>

441
00:33:26,441 --> 00:33:29,274
Universal coverage now.

442
00:33:29,344 --> 00:33:32,074
It will not depend upon
where you work, whether you work,

443
00:33:32,147 --> 00:33:34,115
or if you have a preexisting condition.

444
00:33:34,182 --> 00:33:37,117
Healthcare that can never
be taken away.

445
00:33:37,185 --> 00:33:41,849
<i>Some Republicans complain
Mrs. Clinton is getting a free ride.</i>

446
00:33:41,923 --> 00:33:45,188
It's fairly risky business
what President Clinton did,

447
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:48,855
to put his wife in charge of
some big policy program.

448
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:52,127
And while I don't share the chairman's joy
at our holding hearings

449
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,727
on a government-run healthcare system,

450
00:33:55,804 --> 00:33:59,570
I do share his intention to make the debate
and the legislative process

451
00:33:59,641 --> 00:34:04,476
- as exciting as possible.
- I'm sure you will do that, Mr. Armey.

452
00:34:04,546 --> 00:34:09,381
- We'll do the best we can.
- You and Dr. Kevorkian, I think.

453
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:18,949
I have been told about your charm
and wit, and let me say...

454
00:34:19,027 --> 00:34:22,121
Reports on your charm are overstated

455
00:34:22,197 --> 00:34:26,429
- and reports on your wit are understated.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

456
00:34:27,102 --> 00:34:30,003
<i>She drove Washington insane.</i>

457
00:34:30,071 --> 00:34:32,767
Do you want the government
to control your healthcare?

458
00:34:32,841 --> 00:34:35,139
You won't have the choice
of your own doctors.

459
00:34:35,210 --> 00:34:37,110
- Less government.
- More control.

460
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:39,773
- More government.
- Less control for you and your family.

461
00:34:39,848 --> 00:34:44,012
When your mama gets sick, she might talk
to a bureaucrat instead of a doctor.

462
00:34:44,085 --> 00:34:47,179
This is a total mess,
and it's about to get messier.

463
00:34:47,255 --> 00:34:50,190
Not this bureaucratic,
socialistic plan that they have.

464
00:34:50,258 --> 00:34:52,749
- Socialist takeover...
- Socialized medicine.

465
00:34:52,828 --> 00:34:57,128
What really amounts to
a giant social experiment.

466
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,797
<i>Ooh!
Socialized medicine.</i>

467
00:35:01,870 --> 00:35:06,239
<i>Nothing put more fear in us
than the thought of that.</i>

468
00:35:06,308 --> 00:35:09,800
<i>And the chief fearmongers
against socialized medicine</i>

469
00:35:09,878 --> 00:35:12,540
<i>have always been the good doctors</i>

470
00:35:12,614 --> 00:35:14,605
<i>of the American Medical Association.</i>

471
00:35:14,683 --> 00:35:17,880
<i>This would put the government
smack into your hospital,</i>

472
00:35:17,953 --> 00:35:21,252
defining services, setting standards,

473
00:35:21,323 --> 00:35:24,588
establishing committees, calling for reports,

474
00:35:24,659 --> 00:35:27,025
deciding who gets in and who gets out.

475
00:35:27,095 --> 00:35:31,191
After all, the government has to treat
everyone fair and equal, don't you know?

476
00:35:31,266 --> 00:35:36,203
Take us all the way down the road to
a new system of medicine for everybody.

477
00:35:36,271 --> 00:35:39,206
<i>Yes. Medicine for everyone.</i>

478
00:35:39,274 --> 00:35:41,538
<i>The AMA didn't want that.</i>

479
00:35:42,544 --> 00:35:44,808
<i>And to drive the point home further.</i>

480
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:48,475
<i>They held thousands of coffeeklatsches
all over the country.</i>

481
00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:52,850
<i>Where they invited their neighbors
to come and listen to a record</i>

482
00:35:52,921 --> 00:35:58,018
<i>made by a well-known actor
on the evils of socialized medicine.</i>

483
00:35:58,093 --> 00:36:00,186
<i>My name is Ronald Reagan.</i>

484
00:36:00,262 --> 00:36:05,029
<i>One of the traditional methods of imposing
statism or socialism on a people.</i>

485
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,898
<i>Has been by way of medicine.</i>

486
00:36:07,969 --> 00:36:12,599
<i>The doctor begins to lose freedoms. It's
like telling a lie. And one leads to another.</i>

487
00:36:12,674 --> 00:36:15,666
<i>A doctor decides he wants
to practice in one town.</i>

488
00:36:15,744 --> 00:36:18,577
<i>The government says to him.
"You can't live in that town.</i>

489
00:36:18,647 --> 00:36:22,549
<i>They already have enough doctors.
You have to go someplace else. "</i>

490
00:36:22,617 --> 00:36:26,212
<i>All of us can see what happens
once you establish the precedent</i>

491
00:36:26,288 --> 00:36:32,158
<i>that the government can determine
a man's working place and his methods.</i>

492
00:36:32,227 --> 00:36:34,661
<i>And behind it will come
other federal programs</i>

493
00:36:34,729 --> 00:36:38,495
<i>that will invade every area of freedom
as we have known it in this country.</i>

494
00:36:38,567 --> 00:36:43,504
<i>Until one day. We will awake
to find that we have socialism.</i>

495
00:36:47,442 --> 00:36:50,206
<i>The White House
said to tone down the rhetoric.</i>

496
00:36:50,278 --> 00:36:52,678
<i>Reacting to burning an effigy
of Hillary Clinton.</i>

497
00:36:52,747 --> 00:36:57,013
<i>The times may have changed.
But the scare tactics hadn't.</i>

498
00:36:57,085 --> 00:37:00,350
<i>The healthcare industries spent
over a hundred million dollars</i>

499
00:37:00,422 --> 00:37:05,223
<i>to defeat Hillary's healthcare plan.
And they succeeded.</i>

500
00:37:05,293 --> 00:37:08,592
And I want now
to introduce to you the president,

501
00:37:08,663 --> 00:37:11,894
because he loves the Easter egg roll.

502
00:37:11,967 --> 00:37:14,629
<i>For the next seven years
in the White House.</i>

503
00:37:14,703 --> 00:37:16,933
<i>She wasn't allowed to bring it up again.</i>

504
00:37:17,005 --> 00:37:18,939
Is anybody here older than two?

505
00:37:19,007 --> 00:37:21,407
<i>A decade and a half went by.</i>

506
00:37:21,476 --> 00:37:24,775
<i>And still America
had no universal health plan.</i>

507
00:37:25,347 --> 00:37:29,750
<i>The United States slipped to number 37
in healthcare around the world.</i>

508
00:37:29,818 --> 00:37:32,685
<i>Just slightly ahead of Slovenia.</i>

509
00:37:37,392 --> 00:37:42,728
<i>But that's understandable. Because
Congress was busy with other matters.</i>

510
00:37:42,797 --> 00:37:45,391
Mr. Speaker, today I rise
to offer congratulations

511
00:37:45,467 --> 00:37:48,334
to the confectioners
at Just Born Incorporated,

512
00:37:48,403 --> 00:37:50,633
as they celebrate the 50th anniversary

513
00:37:50,705 --> 00:37:53,640
of one of their most recognized
and celebrated products,

514
00:37:53,708 --> 00:37:56,734
not to mention my daughter's favorite,
Marshmallow Peeps.

515
00:37:57,479 --> 00:38:02,382
<i>And thus. The healthcare industry
went unchecked into the 21 st century.</i>

516
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:07,012
Humana more than doubles its fourth
quarter profit, lifts its earning for the year...

517
00:38:07,088 --> 00:38:09,283
United Health has tripled
its share prices.

518
00:38:09,357 --> 00:38:12,053
<i>Making obscene profits...</i>

519
00:38:12,127 --> 00:38:13,958
...better-than-expected earnings.

520
00:38:14,029 --> 00:38:16,623
There's a lot of
wealthy shareholders out there.

521
00:38:16,698 --> 00:38:18,962
Are they willing to share
some of that wealth?

522
00:38:19,034 --> 00:38:22,492
<i>...turning their CEOs
into billionaires.</i>

523
00:38:23,171 --> 00:38:26,766
<i>And skirting the law
whenever they wanted.</i>

524
00:38:28,109 --> 00:38:32,569
<i>But their biggest accomplishment
was buying our United States Congress.</i>

525
00:38:32,647 --> 00:38:37,380
<i>This is Washington at work.
Lobbying has become so brazen...</i>

526
00:38:37,452 --> 00:38:40,478
<i>With four times
as many healthcare lobbyists</i>

527
00:38:40,555 --> 00:38:42,648
<i>than there are members of Congress.</i>

528
00:38:42,724 --> 00:38:45,693
<i>They even managed to buy off old foes.</i>

529
00:38:46,494 --> 00:38:49,327
<i>For her silence.
Hillary was rewarded.</i>

530
00:38:49,397 --> 00:38:52,958
<i>And she became the second largest
recipient in the Senate</i>

531
00:38:53,034 --> 00:38:56,367
<i>of healthcare industry contributions.</i>

532
00:39:00,241 --> 00:39:05,042
We've given the entire healthcare system
over to the insurance industry.

533
00:39:05,113 --> 00:39:09,743
<i>- And they have total control.
- Well. Not total control.</i>

534
00:39:09,818 --> 00:39:14,118
<i>Drug companies like to buy
their members of Congress too.</i>

535
00:39:14,189 --> 00:39:17,556
<i>Here's what it costs
to buy these men.</i>

536
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:19,616
<i>And this woman.</i>

537
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:23,556
<i>This guy.</i>

538
00:39:23,631 --> 00:39:26,122
<i>And this guy. And him too.</i>

539
00:39:27,902 --> 00:39:32,464
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.</i>

540
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:36,943
<i>And the biggest check
was saved for last.</i>

541
00:39:37,011 --> 00:39:39,673
<i>Why did they hand out all this cash?</i>

542
00:39:39,748 --> 00:39:45,209
<i>They wanted a bill passed - a bill
to help seniors with their prescriptions.</i>

543
00:39:45,286 --> 00:39:47,516
Let there be no mistake about it.

544
00:39:47,589 --> 00:39:51,081
Republicans love their mothers,
their fathers and their grandparents

545
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:56,392
as much as anybody else on this hill,
and we're gonna take care of them.

546
00:39:56,464 --> 00:40:01,561
<i>Of course. It was really a bill
to hand over 800 billion of our tax dollars</i>

547
00:40:01,636 --> 00:40:03,900
<i>to the drug and health insurance industry.</i>

548
00:40:03,972 --> 00:40:07,601
<i>By letting the drug companies
charge whatever they wanted.</i>

549
00:40:07,675 --> 00:40:10,906
<i>And making the private health insurance
companies the middleman.</i>

550
00:40:10,979 --> 00:40:13,914
<i>Everybody was going to get their cut.</i>

551
00:40:13,982 --> 00:40:16,644
<i>The man they appointed
to get the job done</i>

552
00:40:16,718 --> 00:40:19,312
<i>was congressman Billy Tauzin.</i>

553
00:40:19,387 --> 00:40:24,620
<i>He was the right man for the job
because he had a secret weapon.</i>

554
00:40:24,692 --> 00:40:28,856
There's no one in this house loves
their mother more than I love my mother.

555
00:40:28,930 --> 00:40:30,363
I challenge you on that, sir.

556
00:40:30,431 --> 00:40:35,562
Nobody in this body that loves their mother
any more or any less than any one of us.

557
00:40:36,304 --> 00:40:37,862
I love that woman.

558
00:40:37,939 --> 00:40:41,033
Do you think for a second
you love your moms and dads

559
00:40:41,109 --> 00:40:43,077
any more than we love ours?

560
00:40:43,144 --> 00:40:46,705
Do you think Republicans
and Democrats who will vote...

561
00:40:46,781 --> 00:40:50,478
Do you really believe that, Mr. Stoddard?
God bless you.

562
00:40:50,552 --> 00:40:53,680
<i>Oh. They all loved their mothers.</i>

563
00:40:53,755 --> 00:40:57,953
<i>It's just that they didn't
love our mothers as much.</i>

564
00:40:58,026 --> 00:41:04,329
Now I'm honored and pleased
to sign this historic piece of legislation -

565
00:41:04,399 --> 00:41:08,392
the Medicare Prescription Drug,
Improvement, and Modernization Act

566
00:41:08,469 --> 00:41:10,460
of 2003.

567
00:41:12,540 --> 00:41:16,237
<i>What they didn't tell us was
that the elderly could end up paying more</i>

568
00:41:16,311 --> 00:41:19,178
<i>for their prescriptions than they did before.</i>

569
00:41:19,247 --> 00:41:25,675
<i>Over to thirds of senior citizens
could still pay over $ 2.000 a year.</i>

570
00:41:25,753 --> 00:41:30,713
<i>And when it was over. 14 congressional
aids who worked on the bill</i>

571
00:41:30,792 --> 00:41:36,697
<i>quit their jobs on the Hill and went
to work for the healthcare industry.</i>

572
00:41:36,764 --> 00:41:39,062
<i>As did one congressman.</i>

573
00:41:39,133 --> 00:41:43,160
<i># 'Cause I've got a golden ticket...</i>

574
00:41:43,238 --> 00:41:47,675
<i>Billy Tauzin left Congress
to become the CEO of PhRMA.</i>

575
00:41:47,742 --> 00:41:49,767
<i>The drug industry lobby.</i>

576
00:41:49,844 --> 00:41:52,472
<i>For a salary of $ 2 million a year.</i>

577
00:41:55,016 --> 00:41:58,281
<i>Oh. It was a happy day in Washington.</i>

578
00:41:58,353 --> 00:42:04,314
<i>Many Americans knew they were never
going to see universal healthcare.</i>

579
00:42:04,392 --> 00:42:09,625
<i>And that's why some of them
decided to look elsewhere for help.</i>

580
00:42:14,335 --> 00:42:17,270
<i>We're driving across
the Detroit river.</i>

581
00:42:17,338 --> 00:42:20,637
Back there is the Renaissance Center,
you can see it.

582
00:42:20,708 --> 00:42:25,042
General Motors' headquarters,
downtown Detroit, the skyline.

583
00:42:25,113 --> 00:42:28,344
You get a really nice view
from driving over the bridge.

584
00:42:28,416 --> 00:42:31,783
<i>This is Adrian Campbell.
A single mother.</i>

585
00:42:31,853 --> 00:42:35,983
<i>Who at the age of 22
came down with cancer.</i>

586
00:42:36,057 --> 00:42:40,426
<i>I got cervical cancer and I was
denied through the insurance company.</i>

587
00:42:40,495 --> 00:42:44,591
They said, "We're not paying for it
because you're 22 and you don't have... "

588
00:42:44,666 --> 00:42:48,295
"You shouldn't be having cervical cancer.
You're too young. "

589
00:42:48,369 --> 00:42:51,827
<i>Forced into debt.
But now cancer free.</i>

590
00:42:51,906 --> 00:42:55,069
<i>Adrian was fed up
with the American healthcare system.</i>

591
00:42:55,143 --> 00:42:57,168
<i>She had a new plan.</i>

592
00:42:57,245 --> 00:43:00,009
I have everything ready
before I even hit the border.

593
00:43:00,081 --> 00:43:04,017
I got my passports ready,
I got my money out.

594
00:43:04,085 --> 00:43:07,350
It's three dollars and 25 cents
to get across one way.

595
00:43:07,422 --> 00:43:13,156
And I got everything just sitting
up here on my visor just ready to go.

596
00:43:17,231 --> 00:43:19,722
Aurora, be very quiet.

597
00:43:23,071 --> 00:43:25,266
- Citizenships?
- US.

598
00:43:25,340 --> 00:43:27,035
- Where do you live?
- Michigan.

599
00:43:27,108 --> 00:43:29,440
- That's not on, right?
- No.

600
00:43:30,378 --> 00:43:32,812
<i>She may live in Michigan.</i>

601
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:38,546
<i>But ten blocks across the border.
Adrian becomes a Canadian.</i>

602
00:43:38,619 --> 00:43:41,452
How long have you been living here?
Three months?

603
00:43:41,522 --> 00:43:45,891
A couple.
I haven't applied for the OHIP card yet.

604
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:48,451
- I still have mine.
- It takes ten minutes.

605
00:43:48,529 --> 00:43:52,021
That's fine, I don't mind.
OK, thank you.

606
00:43:52,100 --> 00:43:54,660
I put down Kyle's address at the clinic,

607
00:43:54,736 --> 00:43:57,534
and when they ask, you know,
what my relationship is,

608
00:43:57,605 --> 00:44:01,701
I put down that I was
his common-law partner.

609
00:44:01,776 --> 00:44:03,835
I don't like to lie and I don't like liars.

610
00:44:03,911 --> 00:44:09,816
It's little white lies, but it's...
You know, I'm saving the money.

611
00:44:09,884 --> 00:44:15,220
You don't bring a checkbook when you
go to the hospital here. It's provided to us.

612
00:44:15,289 --> 00:44:19,453
It's something you don't have to worry
about or go out of your way to get.

613
00:44:19,527 --> 00:44:21,188
Stress free.

614
00:44:26,167 --> 00:44:28,965
<i>- They called the cops.
- The presence of our camera</i>

615
00:44:29,037 --> 00:44:31,096
<i>alerted the clinic
that something was up.</i>

616
00:44:31,172 --> 00:44:33,572
And I don't think
I'm gonna get seen now.

617
00:44:33,641 --> 00:44:36,166
So I have another idea.

618
00:44:36,244 --> 00:44:39,270
I'm gonna go down to the other clinic.

619
00:44:39,347 --> 00:44:43,078
There is a clinic down...
one that we passed.

620
00:44:44,118 --> 00:44:47,212
The police showed up over there.
Look.

621
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:53,159
<i>Yes. What Adrian was doing
was illegal. But we're Americans.</i>

622
00:44:53,227 --> 00:44:55,889
<i>We go into other countries
when we need to.</i>

623
00:44:56,564 --> 00:44:59,260
<i>It's tricky. But it's allowed.</i>

624
00:45:02,403 --> 00:45:05,133
<i>It's kind of frustrating having...
I mean...</i>

625
00:45:05,206 --> 00:45:08,403
Just get married and that'd solve
everything - she'd be covered.

626
00:45:08,476 --> 00:45:12,242
Americans marry Canadians
just for the healthcare!

627
00:45:12,313 --> 00:45:15,771
<i>- I'm being used.
- Sounds like a good idea.</i>

628
00:45:15,850 --> 00:45:19,877
See if it works.
Start something. Start a trend.

629
00:45:22,023 --> 00:45:24,355
In Canada they give everybody
free healthcare.

630
00:45:24,425 --> 00:45:27,258
- Doesn't it work up there?
- No, unfortunately it doesn't.

631
00:45:27,328 --> 00:45:30,923
We wait months to get treatment
you can get in a week or a few days here.

632
00:45:30,998 --> 00:45:35,662
<i>In Canada you have to wait
nine to ten months for bypass surgery.</i>

633
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:40,764
<i>Many Canadians believe
it's the healthcare system itself that's sick.</i>

634
00:45:40,842 --> 00:45:42,742
<i>They pay their doctors less.</i>

635
00:45:42,810 --> 00:45:46,246
<i>A surgeon can only do
a certain number of operations each year.</i>

636
00:45:46,314 --> 00:45:49,078
<i>With only so many
expensive new pieces of equipment.</i>

637
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:53,314
It's easier for your cat or dog
to receive an MRI here in America.

638
00:45:53,387 --> 00:45:57,847
You die of cancer waiting for chemo 'cause
all of Ottawa has one chemo machine.

639
00:45:57,925 --> 00:46:02,385
If you think socialized medicine
is a good idea, ask a Canadian.

640
00:46:03,965 --> 00:46:09,926
<i>I thought who better to ask than
my Canadian relatives. Bob and Estelle.</i>

641
00:46:10,004 --> 00:46:13,303
<i>But they wouldn't cross the border
into America.</i>

642
00:46:13,374 --> 00:46:17,105
<i>They wanted me to meet them
at Sears. In Canada.</i>

643
00:46:17,178 --> 00:46:20,477
What are you guys doing here?

644
00:46:20,548 --> 00:46:24,814
- We're buying insurance.
- We're going to the States to see you.

645
00:46:24,886 --> 00:46:26,877
Right, that's just across the river.

646
00:46:26,954 --> 00:46:28,512
Yeah.

647
00:46:28,589 --> 00:46:32,889
You wouldn't go over to see us in Michigan
for a couple of hours without insurance?

648
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:37,363
No, we wouldn't. We're just adamant
about it. We would not do it.

649
00:46:37,431 --> 00:46:41,697
If somebody punches us in the mouth
or something, something like that...

650
00:46:41,769 --> 00:46:45,136
You don't want to get caught
in the American health system thing?

651
00:46:45,206 --> 00:46:50,473
We have nothing against Americans
or America, or anything like that at all.

652
00:46:50,545 --> 00:46:57,041
<i>- We're a nice and simple people.
- Not very simple, but certainly very nice.</i>

653
00:46:58,619 --> 00:47:02,020
<i>I decided to explore
their anti-American views further.</i>

654
00:47:02,089 --> 00:47:04,387
<i>Over some fine Canadian cuisine.</i>

655
00:47:04,458 --> 00:47:08,189
We have a friend who went to Hawaii.

656
00:47:08,262 --> 00:47:12,494
And he sustained a head injury
while he was there.

657
00:47:12,567 --> 00:47:15,331
And before he was
well enough to come home,

658
00:47:15,403 --> 00:47:19,430
he had chalked up a bill
of over $600,000.

659
00:47:20,741 --> 00:47:25,075
So what middle-class Canadian
could absorb that?

660
00:47:25,146 --> 00:47:29,515
<i>I guess I feel bad that you would
have to worry about something like that.</i>

661
00:47:29,584 --> 00:47:33,577
We're not criticizing your country,
we're just giving you the facts,

662
00:47:33,654 --> 00:47:38,284
that we could not afford
to be without insurance.

663
00:47:38,359 --> 00:47:41,920
<i>- Even for a day?
- Even for a day.</i>

664
00:47:43,197 --> 00:47:47,156
<i>To prove their point even further.
They sent me over to a local golf course</i>

665
00:47:47,235 --> 00:47:53,299
<i>to talk to Larry Godfrey. Who had a golfing
accident while on vacation in Florida.</i>

666
00:47:53,374 --> 00:47:58,277
I could hear a noise and feel a pain,
and the tendon snapped off this bone here

667
00:47:58,346 --> 00:48:00,644
that holds the bicep in place.

668
00:48:00,715 --> 00:48:04,276
So this bicep muscle was released,
like on an elastic,

669
00:48:04,352 --> 00:48:06,786
and it ended up here on my chest.

670
00:48:06,854 --> 00:48:10,085
- The muscle ended up in your chest?
- Right. Ended up here.

671
00:48:10,958 --> 00:48:14,291
<i>Like all good golfers.
Larry finished his round</i>

672
00:48:14,362 --> 00:48:17,354
<i>before seeking medical attention.</i>

673
00:48:17,431 --> 00:48:20,195
<i>That's when he got the bad news.</i>

674
00:48:20,268 --> 00:48:22,896
I wasn't too worried as I had
out-of-country insurance,

675
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:26,929
but when he told me
it was 23 or 24,000, then I....

676
00:48:27,008 --> 00:48:30,444
<i>- 24,000?
- Dollars, yes.</i>

677
00:48:30,511 --> 00:48:34,277
So if you'd stayed in the United States,
this would have cost you $ 24,000?

678
00:48:34,348 --> 00:48:38,842
Instead, you went back to Canada,
and Canada paid your total expenses?

679
00:48:38,919 --> 00:48:41,410
- Everything.
- Paid for the operation. It cost you?

680
00:48:41,489 --> 00:48:42,820
- Nothing.
- Zero.

681
00:48:42,890 --> 00:48:45,358
Zero. Zero.

682
00:48:45,426 --> 00:48:49,590
I'm wondering why you expect your fellow
Canadians, who don't have your problem,

683
00:48:49,664 --> 00:48:54,761
why should they, through their tax dollars,
have to pay for a problem you have?

684
00:48:54,835 --> 00:48:58,464
Because we would
do the same for them.

685
00:48:58,539 --> 00:49:02,942
It's just the way it's always been
and it's the way we hope it'll always be.

686
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:05,740
Right, but if you
just had to pay for your problem,

687
00:49:05,813 --> 00:49:09,544
and don't pay for everybody else's
problem, just take care of yourself?

688
00:49:09,617 --> 00:49:13,348
Well, there are a lot of people who aren't
in a position to be able to do that.

689
00:49:13,421 --> 00:49:15,981
And somebody has to look after them.

690
00:49:16,057 --> 00:49:18,150
Are you a member of the Socialist Party?

691
00:49:18,225 --> 00:49:20,693
- No. No.
- Green Party?

692
00:49:20,761 --> 00:49:26,131
No. Well, actually, I'm a member
of the Conservative Party.

693
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:28,361
Is that bad?

694
00:49:29,236 --> 00:49:32,728
- Well, it's just a little confusing.
- Well...

695
00:49:32,807 --> 00:49:35,207
It shouldn't be. I think that...

696
00:49:35,276 --> 00:49:38,609
Where medical matters are concerned,
it wouldn't matter in Canada

697
00:49:38,679 --> 00:49:42,911
what party you were affiliated with, if any.

698
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:45,975
But, to us,
as we look across the river here,

699
00:49:46,053 --> 00:49:48,647
you know, why don't you think
we don't believe that?

700
00:49:48,723 --> 00:49:51,248
What's wrong on this issue with us?

701
00:49:51,325 --> 00:49:57,457
I guess the powers that be
don't share our beliefs

702
00:49:57,531 --> 00:49:59,897
that healthcare ought to be universal.

703
00:49:59,967 --> 00:50:05,030
I mean, Canadians didn't until we met up
with a guy named Tommy Douglas,

704
00:50:05,106 --> 00:50:09,236
who pretty much
changed everyone's mind.

705
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:13,076
- One guy?
- One guy, yeah. One guy did it, he...

706
00:50:13,147 --> 00:50:16,116
- Can he come over and visit us?
- He's dead, unfortunately.

707
00:50:16,183 --> 00:50:18,174
In fact, he was...

708
00:50:18,252 --> 00:50:23,554
He's just most recently been revered as
Canada's singular most important person.

709
00:50:23,624 --> 00:50:26,457
- We think so much of...
- You mean in your history?

710
00:50:26,527 --> 00:50:28,461
In our whole history.

711
00:50:28,529 --> 00:50:31,396
- More than your first prime minister?
- Absolutely, yeah.

712
00:50:31,465 --> 00:50:33,956
Even more than Wayne Gretzky.

713
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:36,969
- No way!
- Absolutely. Yeah.

714
00:50:37,037 --> 00:50:40,996
- More than Cline Dion?
- Great singer. More than Cline, yeah.

715
00:50:41,075 --> 00:50:43,908
- More than Rocky and Bullwinkle?
- Maybe.

716
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:52,517
As the blade went through,
it caught the glove I was wearing

717
00:50:52,586 --> 00:50:58,456
and it sliced through the entire group
of fingers, completely taking them off.

718
00:50:58,526 --> 00:51:01,859
And I realized
that I needed help immediately.

719
00:51:02,897 --> 00:51:06,094
<i>Obviously, putting on
amputated fingers or arms or limbs</i>

720
00:51:06,167 --> 00:51:08,362
is one of the more dramatic things
we can do.

721
00:51:08,436 --> 00:51:12,566
If you're looking at five fingers,
you're looking at a 24-hour operation.

722
00:51:12,640 --> 00:51:16,440
There actually was four surgeons,
as well as all the nurses

723
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:21,038
and two different anesthetists
to carry out an operation of that magnitude.

724
00:51:21,115 --> 00:51:25,848
When Brad came in, we didn't have to
worry about whether he could afford it.

725
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:31,358
He needed help and we could concentrate
on the best way to bring him through it.

726
00:51:32,293 --> 00:51:37,526
<i>I met this American, he'd cut off
the ends of two of his fingers with a saw.</i>

727
00:51:37,598 --> 00:51:43,195
So when he arrived at the hospital, they
told him one finger's gonna cost $60,000,

728
00:51:43,270 --> 00:51:46,034
and the other one was gonna be $12,000.

729
00:51:46,106 --> 00:51:49,439
He had to choose
which finger he could afford.

730
00:51:49,510 --> 00:51:51,876
Down. Bend the long finger down.

731
00:51:51,946 --> 00:51:56,110
<i>We've never told someone
that they couldn't put a finger back on</i>

732
00:51:56,183 --> 00:51:58,174
because the system wouldn't allow it.

733
00:51:58,252 --> 00:52:03,622
I'm very glad I work within a system that
allows me the freedom to look after people,

734
00:52:03,691 --> 00:52:06,182
and not have to
make choices like that.

735
00:52:06,260 --> 00:52:09,991
<i>It seems nothing we were told
about the Canadian system was true.</i>

736
00:52:10,064 --> 00:52:12,498
<i>Maybe I was just
in the wrong part of town.</i>

737
00:52:12,566 --> 00:52:16,525
<i>So I went across the city
to a crowded hospital waiting room.</i>

738
00:52:16,604 --> 00:52:18,868
How long did you have to wait here
to get help?

739
00:52:18,939 --> 00:52:21,373
- 20 minutes.
- 45 minutes.

740
00:52:21,442 --> 00:52:24,843
- I got helped right away.
- You can see how crowded this is.

741
00:52:24,912 --> 00:52:27,403
They really do an amazing job.

742
00:52:27,481 --> 00:52:30,678
<i>Did you have to get permission
to come to this hospital?</i>

743
00:52:30,751 --> 00:52:32,309
- No.
- No.

744
00:52:32,386 --> 00:52:34,377
We can go anywhere we want.

745
00:52:34,455 --> 00:52:38,391
<i>You don't have to get it
preapproved by your insurance company?</i>

746
00:52:38,459 --> 00:52:42,020
<i>- Oh, heavens, no.
- Can you choose your doctor?</i>

747
00:52:42,096 --> 00:52:44,394
<i>- Oh, yes.
- What's your deductible?</i>

748
00:52:44,465 --> 00:52:46,933
- Nothing.
- I don't think we have any.

749
00:52:47,001 --> 00:52:50,664
I don't know.
I don't think there's any, as far as I know.

750
00:52:50,738 --> 00:52:52,763
<i>- So what did this cost?
- Nothing.</i>

751
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:55,536
We know in America
people pay for their healthcare,

752
00:52:55,609 --> 00:53:00,410
but I guess we don't understand that,
'cause we don't have to deal with that.

753
00:53:00,481 --> 00:53:03,973
And we're dealing with
Parkinson's, stroke, heart attack.

754
00:53:04,051 --> 00:53:06,542
We're very, very lucky.
Really we are.

755
00:53:06,620 --> 00:53:09,953
I mean, we complain.
People complain about everything, right?

756
00:53:10,024 --> 00:53:14,757
<i>- Right, you're Canadian.
- But on the whole, it's a fabulous system</i>

757
00:53:14,828 --> 00:53:20,528
for making sure that the least of us
and the best of us are taken care of.

758
00:53:20,601 --> 00:53:25,868
<i>It turns out that Canadians
live three years longer than we do.</i>

759
00:53:25,940 --> 00:53:31,742
<i>That's not hard to believe
when you meet fellow Americans like Erik.</i>

760
00:53:31,812 --> 00:53:36,146
# Oh, England, here we go

761
00:53:38,452 --> 00:53:42,855
<i>Erik Turnbow of Olympia.
Washington. Saved up his whole life</i>

762
00:53:42,923 --> 00:53:47,690
<i>so that he could visit the famed
Abbey Road crosswalk in London.</i>

763
00:53:47,761 --> 00:53:52,095
<i>But it wasn't enough for Erik to just
walk across the road like The Beatles did.</i>

764
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:55,329
<i>He had to do it his own special way.</i>

765
00:53:56,303 --> 00:54:01,605
<i>Here's Erik, about to walk
on his hands across Abbey Road.</i>

766
00:54:02,543 --> 00:54:04,534
Ready?

767
00:54:05,279 --> 00:54:07,270
<i>Ugh!</i>

768
00:54:08,782 --> 00:54:09,874
<i>Try it again.</i>

769
00:54:18,993 --> 00:54:20,858
- Are you in pain?
- Yeah.

770
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:30,765
<i>The British hospital
didn't charge Erik anything for his stay.</i>

771
00:54:30,838 --> 00:54:36,105
<i>And only about ten bucks
for all the way-cool drugs they gave him.</i>

772
00:54:36,176 --> 00:54:40,078
<i>- You're all slung up.
- I'm gonna be OK.</i>

773
00:54:43,717 --> 00:54:49,087
<i>I decided to go to Great Britain to
find out how a hospital stay could be free.</i>

774
00:54:49,156 --> 00:54:52,489
<i>And drugs could cost only ten dollars.</i>

775
00:54:54,762 --> 00:55:00,029
If I come in here and I have a prescription
and it requires 30 pills, how much is that?

776
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:02,898
It's L6.65.
That's the standard charge.

777
00:55:02,970 --> 00:55:06,406
<i>L6.65?
So that's what? Ten dollars or so?</i>

778
00:55:06,473 --> 00:55:09,533
- Yes.
- What if I needed 60 pills, how much is it?

779
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:11,805
- Same charge.
- 120 pills?

780
00:55:11,879 --> 00:55:14,313
- L6.65 still.
- It doesn't matter how many pills?

781
00:55:14,381 --> 00:55:18,147
- No.
- What if it's an HIV drug or a cancer drug?

782
00:55:18,218 --> 00:55:19,845
Still L6.65.

783
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:25,381
If they are under 16 or over 60,
they're automatically exempt.

784
00:55:25,459 --> 00:55:30,522
<i>So only a working adult
who earns enough money pays the L6.65?</i>

785
00:55:30,597 --> 00:55:32,724
Everybody else gets medication free?

786
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,428
- No money being exchanged here?
- No, nothing.

787
00:55:35,502 --> 00:55:39,029
- There's no money being exchanged?
- I'm over 60. We don't pay.

788
00:55:39,106 --> 00:55:41,370
What's the purpose
of the cash register?

789
00:55:43,577 --> 00:55:48,844
I'm just wondering where's the bread
and the milk and the candy in here?

790
00:55:48,916 --> 00:55:52,317
I can't pick up
any laundry detergent here?

791
00:55:52,386 --> 00:55:57,380
No. I haven't been trained for that many
years to be selling detergents, so no.

792
00:56:08,869 --> 00:56:15,206
<i>I next went to a state-run hospital.
Operated by the National Health Service.</i>

793
00:56:16,176 --> 00:56:20,510
<i>I'm due in seven weeks
and I get six months off, paid.</i>

794
00:56:20,581 --> 00:56:24,984
And then I can have six months off unpaid
as well, so I'm actually taking a year.

795
00:56:25,052 --> 00:56:27,919
<i>Well, that sounds
like a luxury where I'm from.</i>

796
00:56:27,988 --> 00:56:33,085
Oh, really, it's not like that in the US?
No? Not at all, no?

797
00:56:33,594 --> 00:56:35,926
<i>So what do you pay
for a stay here?</i>

798
00:56:35,996 --> 00:56:38,328
No one pays.

799
00:56:39,767 --> 00:56:42,292
They were asking how do people pay.

800
00:56:42,369 --> 00:56:44,803
I said there isn't...
You don't, you just leave.

801
00:56:44,872 --> 00:56:49,366
It's national insurance.
There's no bill at the end of it, as it were.

802
00:56:51,845 --> 00:56:55,645
<i>Even with insurance.
There's bound to be a bill somewhere.</i>

803
00:56:55,716 --> 00:56:59,277
- So where's the billing department?
- There isn't a billing department.

804
00:56:59,353 --> 00:57:01,321
There's no such thing.

805
00:57:01,922 --> 00:57:04,015
<i>What did they charge
for that baby?</i>

806
00:57:04,091 --> 00:57:07,117
- Sorry?
- You gotta pay before you can get out?

807
00:57:07,194 --> 00:57:11,153
- No. This is NHS.
- No, no. Everything is on NHS.

808
00:57:11,231 --> 00:57:13,722
You know, it's not America.

809
00:57:16,103 --> 00:57:22,042
<i>Maybe I'd have better luck in the
part where things get seriously expensive.</i>

810
00:57:22,109 --> 00:57:26,478
This guy broke his ankle.
How much will this cost him?

811
00:57:26,547 --> 00:57:31,109
The emergency room visit. He'll have
some huge bill when he's done, right?

812
00:57:31,185 --> 00:57:34,245
Here... NHS, everything is free.

813
00:57:34,321 --> 00:57:37,620
<i>I'm asking about hospital charges
and you're laughing.</i>

814
00:57:37,691 --> 00:57:41,422
I was never asked this question
in the emergency department, that's why.

815
00:57:43,230 --> 00:57:46,393
<i>I was starting to fall
for this "everything is free" bit.</i>

816
00:57:46,466 --> 00:57:48,457
<i>And then I discovered this.</i>

817
00:57:49,803 --> 00:57:53,739
So this is where people come to pay
their bill when they're done staying here?

818
00:57:53,807 --> 00:57:56,867
No, this is the NHS hospital,
so you don't pay the bill.

819
00:57:56,944 --> 00:57:59,742
You get to just go home?

820
00:57:59,813 --> 00:58:04,546
Why does it say "cashier" here
if people don't have to pay a bill?

821
00:58:04,618 --> 00:58:07,212
All we have is a little man
who stands behind a counter

822
00:58:07,287 --> 00:58:11,348
and he gives people money
if they've had to pay for transport.

823
00:58:11,425 --> 00:58:15,486
Those who have reduced means
get their travel expenses reimbursed.

824
00:58:15,562 --> 00:58:16,654
Thank you.

825
00:58:16,730 --> 00:58:21,997
<i>So in British hospitals. Instead
of money going into the cashier's window.</i>

826
00:58:22,069 --> 00:58:23,627
<i>Money comes out.</i>

827
00:58:23,704 --> 00:58:26,673
The criteria for letting you out
are not if you've paid,

828
00:58:26,740 --> 00:58:30,073
the criteria are, are you fit to go
and are you going somewhere safe?

829
00:58:30,143 --> 00:58:33,374
<i>Clearly. I was just
the butt of a joke here.</i>

830
00:58:38,485 --> 00:58:41,682
<i>What I needed
was a good old-fashioned American</i>

831
00:58:41,755 --> 00:58:44,280
<i>who would have some understanding.</i>

832
00:58:44,358 --> 00:58:47,919
<i>I first came to London in 1992.</i>

833
00:58:47,995 --> 00:58:52,295
And we just ended up staying
and we had three children here.

834
00:58:52,366 --> 00:58:57,668
Well, I had them all on the NHS, which is
the British National Health Service.

835
00:58:57,738 --> 00:59:01,469
I think, like a lot of Americans,
assumed that a socialized medicine

836
00:59:01,541 --> 00:59:04,510
was just bottom of the rung treatment,

837
00:59:04,578 --> 00:59:08,571
that the only way would be horrible
and it would be like the Soviet Union.

838
00:59:08,649 --> 00:59:10,617
I mean, that's kind of how...

839
00:59:10,684 --> 00:59:15,178
<i>- And it's terrible that that's what I thought.
- That's what I thought. Too.</i>

840
00:59:15,255 --> 00:59:18,850
<i>After having a baby.
It's right back to the wheat fields.</i>

841
00:59:43,383 --> 00:59:46,580
<i>And then it occurred to me
that back home in America.</i>

842
00:59:46,653 --> 00:59:49,554
<i>We've socialized a lot of things.</i>

843
01:00:14,147 --> 01:00:20,052
<i>I kind of like having a police department
and fire department and the library.</i>

844
01:00:20,120 --> 01:00:25,990
<i>And I got to wondering. Why don't we
have more of these free. Socialized things.</i>

845
01:00:26,059 --> 01:00:27,549
<i>Like healthcare?</i>

846
01:00:27,627 --> 01:00:32,530
When did this whole idea that every British
citizen should have a right to healthcare?

847
01:00:32,599 --> 01:00:35,932
Well, if you go back,
it all began with democracy.

848
01:00:36,003 --> 01:00:40,770
Before we had the vote all the power
was in the hands of rich people.

849
01:00:40,841 --> 01:00:43,469
If you had money, you could get
healthcare, education,

850
01:00:43,543 --> 01:00:45,443
look after yourself when you were old.

851
01:00:45,512 --> 01:00:50,506
And what democracy did
was to give the poor the vote.

852
01:00:50,584 --> 01:00:54,714
And it moved power from the marketplace
to the polling station.

853
01:00:54,788 --> 01:00:57,348
From the wallet to the ballot.

854
01:00:57,424 --> 01:00:59,483
And what people said was very simple.

855
01:00:59,559 --> 01:01:03,655
They said, "In the 1930s,
we had mass unemployment. "

856
01:01:03,717 --> 01:01:06,277
"But we don't have unemployment
during the war. "

857
01:01:06,353 --> 01:01:08,685
"If you can have full employment
by killing Germans,

858
01:01:08,756 --> 01:01:13,455
why can't we have it by building hospitals,
schools, recruiting nurses and teachers?"

859
01:01:13,527 --> 01:01:18,863
If you can find money to kill people,
you can find money to help people.

860
01:01:18,932 --> 01:01:19,762
Right.

861
01:01:19,833 --> 01:01:23,564
This leaflet that was issued
was very, very straightforward.

862
01:01:23,637 --> 01:01:26,333
- What year was this?
- This was 1948.

863
01:01:26,407 --> 01:01:29,570
"Your new National Health Service
begins on the 5th of July. "

864
01:01:29,643 --> 01:01:31,634
"What is it? How do you get it?"

865
01:01:31,712 --> 01:01:36,547
"It will provide you with all
medical, dental and nursing care. "

866
01:01:36,617 --> 01:01:41,680
"Everyone, rich or poor, man, woman
or child, can use it or any part of it. "

867
01:01:41,755 --> 01:01:44,952
"There are no charges,
except for a few special items. "

868
01:01:45,025 --> 01:01:49,121
"There is no insurance qualifications,
but it is not a charity. "

869
01:01:49,196 --> 01:01:51,858
"You are paying for it
mainly as taxpayers,

870
01:01:51,932 --> 01:01:56,130
and it will relieve your money worries
in times of illness. "

871
01:01:56,203 --> 01:02:00,162
Now, somehow,
the few words sum the whole thing up.

872
01:02:05,979 --> 01:02:10,814
<i>I was amazed
when he said this all started in 1948.</i>

873
01:02:11,318 --> 01:02:16,221
<i>The British had come out of a devastating
experience through World War II.</i>

874
01:02:16,290 --> 01:02:19,555
<i>The country was destroyed
and nearly bankrupt.</i>

875
01:02:19,626 --> 01:02:22,151
<i>They had nothing.</i>

876
01:02:22,229 --> 01:02:24,891
<i>In just one eight-month period.</i>

877
01:02:24,965 --> 01:02:28,833
<i>Over 42.000 civilians lost their lives.</i>

878
01:02:29,670 --> 01:02:32,901
<i>What we went through
in to hours on 911.</i>

879
01:02:32,973 --> 01:02:35,999
<i>They went through
nearly every single day.</i>

880
01:02:37,845 --> 01:02:44,011
<i>Remember how we all felt after 911?
All of us pulling together?</i>

881
01:02:44,084 --> 01:02:46,518
<i>I guess that's how they felt.</i>

882
01:02:47,521 --> 01:02:50,979
<i>And the first way that they decided
to pull together after the war</i>

883
01:02:51,058 --> 01:02:55,825
<i>was to provide free medical care
for everyone.</i>

884
01:02:55,896 --> 01:03:01,334
Even Mrs. Thatcher said, "The National
Health Service is safe in our hands. "

885
01:03:01,401 --> 01:03:04,199
It's as non-controversial
as votes for women.

886
01:03:04,271 --> 01:03:06,796
Nobody could say,
"Why should women have the vote?" now.

887
01:03:06,874 --> 01:03:09,468
People wouldn't have it,
they wouldn't in Britain.

888
01:03:09,543 --> 01:03:14,173
They wouldn't accept the deterioration or
destruction of the National Health Service.

889
01:03:14,248 --> 01:03:17,843
If Thatcher or Blair said, "I'm going
to dismantle national healthcare... "

890
01:03:17,918 --> 01:03:19,579
There would have been a revolution.

891
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:34,557
<i>A report from the AMA
into the health of 55- to 64-year-olds</i>

892
01:03:34,635 --> 01:03:37,502
<i>says Brits are far healthier
than Americans.</i>

893
01:03:37,571 --> 01:03:42,372
<i>For every illness that we looked
at. Americans had more of it than English.</i>

894
01:03:42,442 --> 01:03:46,071
<i>Cancer. Heart disease.
Hypertension. Strokes. Lung disease.</i>

895
01:03:46,146 --> 01:03:48,808
<i>All significantly higher for Americans.</i>

896
01:03:48,882 --> 01:03:50,713
<i>Even the poorest people in England</i>

897
01:03:50,784 --> 01:03:55,050
<i>with all the environmental factors that give
them the worst health in the country</i>

898
01:03:55,122 --> 01:04:00,424
can expect to live longer
than the wealthiest people in America.

899
01:04:07,501 --> 01:04:11,403
<i>I was wondering. Though.
What's it like for the doctors here in Britain.</i>

900
01:04:11,471 --> 01:04:15,100
<i>Who have to live
under this kind of state control?</i>

901
01:04:15,175 --> 01:04:16,836
And you're a family doctor?

902
01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:20,243
Yeah, I suppose we'd call them GPs
or general practitioners here.

903
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:23,715
- Right, so you have a family practice?
- Yeah, it's an NHS practice.

904
01:04:23,784 --> 01:04:25,775
We have nine doctors in that practice.

905
01:04:25,852 --> 01:04:27,843
- Paid for by the government?
- Yeah.

906
01:04:27,921 --> 01:04:31,084
You work for the government?
You're a government-paid doctor.

907
01:04:31,158 --> 01:04:34,286
A patient comes to you.
Before you treat them, do you have to call

908
01:04:34,361 --> 01:04:37,159
the government insurance company
before you treat them?

909
01:04:37,231 --> 01:04:40,962
No, I don't deal with money at all
on an everyday basis.

910
01:04:41,034 --> 01:04:44,265
Have you ever had to say no to someone
who was sick and needed help?

911
01:04:44,338 --> 01:04:47,637
- No, never.
- Have you heard of anyone

912
01:04:47,708 --> 01:04:51,508
being in the hospital and being removed
because they couldn't pay their bill?

913
01:04:51,578 --> 01:04:54,138
No, never.
And I wouldn't want to work in that system.

914
01:04:54,214 --> 01:04:58,150
So working for the government,
you probably have to use public transport?

915
01:04:58,218 --> 01:05:01,210
No. I have a car that I use
and I drive to work.

916
01:05:01,288 --> 01:05:03,279
An old beater?

917
01:05:09,363 --> 01:05:11,627
You live in a rough part of town?

918
01:05:11,698 --> 01:05:15,691
I live in a terrific part of town.
It's called Greenwich.

919
01:05:19,373 --> 01:05:22,001
It's a lovely house.
It's a three-story house.

920
01:05:22,075 --> 01:05:24,805
<i>How many other families
have to live with you?</i>

921
01:05:24,878 --> 01:05:29,872
There's four bedrooms for my wife
and my son. It's just the three of us there.

922
01:05:29,950 --> 01:05:34,887
<i>- How much did you pay for that?
- L550,000. Yes, almost.</i>

923
01:05:34,955 --> 01:05:36,946
<i>So, a million dollars?</i>

924
01:05:37,024 --> 01:05:42,121
You're a government-paid doctor on a
national health insurance healthcare plan,

925
01:05:42,195 --> 01:05:45,187
- and you live in a million-dollar home?
- Yes.

926
01:05:49,770 --> 01:05:53,763
- I think my friends think we do quite well.
- Really? How well do you do?

927
01:05:53,840 --> 01:05:56,604
I earn around 85,000,
including pension.

928
01:05:56,677 --> 01:05:59,145
- L85,000?
- L85,000 a year.

929
01:05:59,212 --> 01:06:02,010
And that includes pension
that they would pay in to me.

930
01:06:02,082 --> 01:06:05,051
They probably earn just
over L100,000 within my practice.

931
01:06:05,118 --> 01:06:09,145
- L100,000? So that's almost $ 200,000?
- Yes, absolutely.

932
01:06:09,222 --> 01:06:12,191
The money that we earn,
we get paid by what we do.

933
01:06:12,259 --> 01:06:16,127
So the better we do for our patients,
then the more we get paid.

934
01:06:16,196 --> 01:06:19,324
- What do you mean?
- There's a new system.

935
01:06:19,399 --> 01:06:23,927
And in that new system, if the most number
of your patients have low blood pressures,

936
01:06:24,004 --> 01:06:26,438
or you get most of your patients
to stop smoking,

937
01:06:26,506 --> 01:06:30,306
or you get your patients to have
mental health reviews if they're unwell,

938
01:06:30,377 --> 01:06:32,845
or low cholesterols,
then you get paid more.

939
01:06:32,913 --> 01:06:37,009
This year, if you get more people
that are your patients to stop smoking,

940
01:06:37,084 --> 01:06:39,245
you'll get more money,
you'll earn more?

941
01:06:39,319 --> 01:06:40,684
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

942
01:06:40,754 --> 01:06:47,455
So doctors in America do not have to fear
having a universal healthcare?

943
01:06:47,527 --> 01:06:51,987
No. I think if you want to have
two or three million-dollar homes

944
01:06:52,065 --> 01:06:55,831
and four or five nice cars
and six or seven nice televisions,

945
01:06:55,902 --> 01:06:59,736
then maybe, yeah, you need to practice
somewhere where you can earn that.

946
01:06:59,806 --> 01:07:01,967
But I think we live comfortably here.

947
01:07:02,042 --> 01:07:04,875
London is expensive,
but I think we live comfortably.

948
01:07:04,945 --> 01:07:09,314
You're getting by OK on the million-dollar
home, the Audi, and the flat-screen TV?

949
01:07:09,383 --> 01:07:11,977
Yeah, we're coping with those.

950
01:07:13,153 --> 01:07:16,213
I think democracy is the most
revolutionary thing in the world.

951
01:07:16,289 --> 01:07:19,747
Far more revolutionary than
socialist ideas, or anybody else's idea.

952
01:07:19,826 --> 01:07:25,492
Because if you have power, you use it
to meet the needs of your community.

953
01:07:25,565 --> 01:07:30,161
And this idea of choice which capital
talks about, "you've got to have a choice,"

954
01:07:30,237 --> 01:07:32,364
choice depends
on the freedom to choose.

955
01:07:32,439 --> 01:07:35,602
If you're shackled with debt,
you don't have a freedom to choose.

956
01:07:35,675 --> 01:07:40,374
<i>It seems it benefits the system if
the average person is shackled with debt.</i>

957
01:07:40,447 --> 01:07:44,315
People in debt become hopeless,
and hopeless people don't vote.

958
01:07:44,384 --> 01:07:46,375
They always say
everyone should vote,

959
01:07:46,453 --> 01:07:50,446
but I think if the poor in Britain
or the United States

960
01:07:50,524 --> 01:07:53,425
voted for people
who represented their interests,

961
01:07:53,493 --> 01:07:56,189
it would be a real democratic revolution.

962
01:07:56,263 --> 01:08:00,222
So they don't want it to happen. So keeping
people hopeless and pessimistic...

963
01:08:00,300 --> 01:08:04,100
See, I think there are two ways
in which people are controlled.

964
01:08:04,171 --> 01:08:08,403
First of all, frighten people,
and secondly, demoralize them.

965
01:08:08,475 --> 01:08:12,241
An educated, healthy and confident
nation is harder to govern.

966
01:08:12,312 --> 01:08:15,611
And I think there's an element
in the thinking of some people:

967
01:08:15,682 --> 01:08:19,448
"We don't want people to be
educated, healthy and confident,

968
01:08:19,519 --> 01:08:22,317
because they would get out of control. "

969
01:08:22,389 --> 01:08:26,519
The top 1 % of the world's population
own 80% of the world's wealth.

970
01:08:26,593 --> 01:08:30,586
It's incredible that people put up with it,
but they're poor,

971
01:08:30,664 --> 01:08:33,132
they're demoralized, they're frightened.

972
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:36,067
And therefore, they think
perhaps the safest thing to do

973
01:08:36,136 --> 01:08:38,969
is to take orders and hope for the best.

974
01:08:43,276 --> 01:08:45,608
<i>And hope for the best
is what we do.</i>

975
01:08:45,679 --> 01:08:48,273
<i>Right from the moment we're born.</i>

976
01:08:48,348 --> 01:08:52,114
<i>We've got the worst infant mortality rate
in the western world.</i>

977
01:08:52,185 --> 01:08:55,177
<i>A baby born in El Salvador
has a better chance of surviving</i>

978
01:08:55,255 --> 01:08:57,280
<i>than a baby born in Detroit.</i>

979
01:08:57,357 --> 01:08:59,951
<i>But it gets better
when we go to school.</i>

980
01:09:00,026 --> 01:09:03,052
<i>Classrooms with 40 students.
Schools with no labs.</i>

981
01:09:03,129 --> 01:09:06,621
<i>No wonder the majority
of our adults can't find Britain on a map.</i>

982
01:09:06,700 --> 01:09:09,168
<i>But that's OK.
There's always college.</i>

983
01:09:09,236 --> 01:09:11,704
<i>By the time we graduate.
Our ass is so in hock.</i>

984
01:09:11,771 --> 01:09:14,467
<i>We're in debt before our first job.</i>

985
01:09:14,541 --> 01:09:19,843
I'm at about... we'll say about $35,000
in debt. That's for my third year in college.

986
01:09:19,913 --> 01:09:23,849
<i>You'll be the employee they're
looking for - one who needs this job.</i>

987
01:09:23,917 --> 01:09:26,750
3,904, 3,905...

988
01:09:26,820 --> 01:09:30,187
<i>What employer wouldn't employ someone
thousands of dollars in debt.</i>

989
01:09:30,257 --> 01:09:33,488
<i>Because they won't cause any trouble?</i>

990
01:09:33,560 --> 01:09:37,929
<i>In addition to paying off your college debt.
You need a job with health insurance.</i>

991
01:09:37,998 --> 01:09:40,523
<i>It would be horrible
to lose that job. Wouldn't it?</i>

992
01:09:40,600 --> 01:09:45,162
You can always quit, you know. There's
no law that says you have to work here.

993
01:09:45,238 --> 01:09:48,332
<i>If that one job
doesn't pay all the bills. Don't worry.</i>

994
01:09:48,408 --> 01:09:52,276
<i>You can get another one.
And another one. And another one.</i>

995
01:09:52,345 --> 01:09:55,940
I work three jobs,
and I feel like I contribute.

996
01:09:56,016 --> 01:09:58,644
- You work three jobs?
- Three jobs, yes.

997
01:09:58,718 --> 01:10:03,246
Uniquely American, isn't it? I mean,
that is fantastic that you're doing that.

998
01:10:04,324 --> 01:10:05,416
Get any sleep?

999
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:08,461
<i>If you're not sleeping.
Take pharmaceuticals.</i>

1000
01:10:08,528 --> 01:10:11,019
<i>You're tired all the time.
You feel sad.</i>

1001
01:10:11,097 --> 01:10:13,395
<i>If you suffer
from excessive worry...</i>

1002
01:10:13,466 --> 01:10:15,627
<i>Generalized anxiety disorder.</i>

1003
01:10:15,702 --> 01:10:18,068
<i>It could be adult ADD.</i>

1004
01:10:18,138 --> 01:10:20,902
<i>- Ask your doctor.
- Ask your doctor.</i>

1005
01:10:20,974 --> 01:10:24,535
<i>Yes. Ask your doctor.
And ask him for more drugs.</i>

1006
01:10:24,611 --> 01:10:27,478
<i>That should keep you doped up
until it's time to retire.</i>

1007
01:10:27,547 --> 01:10:29,879
<i>Did I say retire?</i>

1008
01:10:30,784 --> 01:10:33,480
<i>If you make it to 80.
Your pension will still be there.</i>

1009
01:10:33,553 --> 01:10:37,387
<i>Unlike the new employees for these
companies. Who'll never see a pension.</i>

1010
01:10:37,457 --> 01:10:42,394
<i>But I'm sure our kids will take care of us.
Considering the great life we've given 'em.</i>

1011
01:10:42,462 --> 01:10:46,364
<i>Remember. Let's defeat the terrorists over
there so we don't have to fight them here.</i>

1012
01:10:48,001 --> 01:10:51,869
<i>Kaiser Permanente
is the largest HMO in the country.</i>

1013
01:10:51,938 --> 01:10:56,568
<i>And Dawnelle Keyes was fortunate
enough to be fully insured by them.</i>

1014
01:10:56,643 --> 01:11:01,046
<i>It's a good thing. Because one night.
Her 18-month-old daughter. Mychelle.</i>

1015
01:11:01,114 --> 01:11:03,810
<i>Developed a fever of over 104.</i>

1016
01:11:04,784 --> 01:11:08,242
<i>So. Like any responsible mom.
She called 911.</i>

1017
01:11:08,321 --> 01:11:12,189
<i>And the ambulance took Mychelle
to the closest hospital.</i>

1018
01:11:12,258 --> 01:11:14,283
<i>The hospital checked with her HMO</i>

1019
01:11:14,361 --> 01:11:18,024
<i>and they were told that Kaiser would not
cover the tests and the antibiotics</i>

1020
01:11:18,098 --> 01:11:21,363
<i>necessary to treat Mychelle.</i>

1021
01:11:21,434 --> 01:11:26,235
<i>She would have to take her to
an in-netork. Kaiser-owned hospital.</i>

1022
01:11:26,306 --> 01:11:31,266
Kaiser said that I should
bring her by car to the hospital,

1023
01:11:31,344 --> 01:11:34,711
and that she shouldn't be treated
at Martin Luther King.

1024
01:11:34,781 --> 01:11:39,718
I just continued to ask them
to treat her, and they refused.

1025
01:11:41,287 --> 01:11:45,451
My daughter got worse
and she had a seizure.

1026
01:11:46,559 --> 01:11:52,691
<i>Dawnelle begged doctors to not
listen to Kaiser and to treat her daughter.</i>

1027
01:11:52,766 --> 01:11:58,636
I was escorted out of the hospital
because they felt that I was a threat.

1028
01:11:59,439 --> 01:12:03,432
<i>After hours of delay.
She was transported to Kaiser.</i>

1029
01:12:03,510 --> 01:12:08,140
<i>And got there just in time
to go into cardiac arrest.</i>

1030
01:12:08,214 --> 01:12:12,878
They worked on her for about 30 minutes,
trying to revive her.

1031
01:12:12,952 --> 01:12:19,357
And the doctors came in
and let us know that she had expired.

1032
01:12:22,529 --> 01:12:27,933
I was in a daze, a real daze.
It just didn't seem real.

1033
01:12:29,102 --> 01:12:30,831
I just held her.

1034
01:12:30,904 --> 01:12:35,273
I held her and I told her
that Mommy tried her best to help her,

1035
01:12:35,341 --> 01:12:41,109
to make sure that she was gonna
get the treatment she needed to receive.

1036
01:12:41,181 --> 01:12:45,311
And that I was sorry
that I wasn't able to help her.

1037
01:12:50,957 --> 01:12:53,050
<i>Simon says: Give the answer.</i>

1038
01:12:57,497 --> 01:12:59,226
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

1039
01:12:59,799 --> 01:13:02,700
<i>This is Karena
and her daughter Zo.</i>

1040
01:13:02,769 --> 01:13:06,330
<i>Karena is a graduate
of Michigan State University.</i>

1041
01:13:06,406 --> 01:13:09,864
<i>And a native of my hometown
of Flint. Michigan.</i>

1042
01:13:09,943 --> 01:13:13,743
<i>Six months ago. Zo.
Like Dawnelle's baby Mychelle.</i>

1043
01:13:13,813 --> 01:13:15,974
<i>Came down with a high fever.</i>

1044
01:13:16,049 --> 01:13:19,246
What happened
is she stopped breathing for a little while,

1045
01:13:19,319 --> 01:13:22,618
turned blue and passed out
in my arms, which was...

1046
01:13:22,689 --> 01:13:26,853
It was the most horrible moment
in my life, I think,

1047
01:13:26,926 --> 01:13:30,418
just because I thought
that she was either dead or dying.

1048
01:13:30,497 --> 01:13:32,692
And I had no clue what to do.

1049
01:13:33,266 --> 01:13:37,669
At the hospital, they gave her
some medicine to bring the fever down,

1050
01:13:37,737 --> 01:13:40,171
and examined her, took some blood.

1051
01:13:40,240 --> 01:13:43,403
<i>- What was wrong with her?
- It was a throat infection.</i>

1052
01:13:43,476 --> 01:13:47,139
But we stayed at the hospital
from Friday to Sunday,

1053
01:13:47,213 --> 01:13:50,307
- just so they could keep an eye on her.
- You stayed there that long?

1054
01:13:50,383 --> 01:13:53,511
Yeah. They just basically
kept an eye on her.

1055
01:13:53,586 --> 01:13:57,386
And how much did all this cost you,
the three-plus days in the hospital?

1056
01:13:57,457 --> 01:13:58,788
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

1057
01:13:58,858 --> 01:14:03,056
- Nothing. Nothing at all.
- And that's because?

1058
01:14:04,063 --> 01:14:06,554
- I live in France.
- You live in France?

1059
01:14:06,633 --> 01:14:07,725
Yeah.

1060
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:12,338
<i>Ah. France.</i>

1061
01:14:12,405 --> 01:14:17,138
<i>They enjoy their wine.
Their cigarettes and their fatty foods.</i>

1062
01:14:17,210 --> 01:14:20,270
<i>And yet.
Just like the Canadians and the Brits.</i>

1063
01:14:20,346 --> 01:14:22,906
<i>They live much longer than we do.</i>

1064
01:14:22,982 --> 01:14:26,884
<i>Something about that
seemed grossly unfair.</i>

1065
01:14:28,555 --> 01:14:30,250
<i>This is Alexi Cremieux.</i>

1066
01:14:30,323 --> 01:14:35,852
<i>He spent his entire adult life in the US
without health insurance.</i>

1067
01:14:37,397 --> 01:14:41,561
<i>I lived in America for 13 years.
I loved my life there.</i>

1068
01:14:41,634 --> 01:14:45,934
But then when I discovered that I had
a tumor and I didn't have health insurance,

1069
01:14:46,005 --> 01:14:48,803
unfortunately,
I had to come back here.

1070
01:14:48,875 --> 01:14:52,072
Even though I had never paid taxes
in France 'cause I never worked here -

1071
01:14:52,145 --> 01:14:54,739
I left when I was 18,
I had no Social Security number -

1072
01:14:54,814 --> 01:14:57,715
for them it was,
"He needs treatment, he has no income,

1073
01:14:57,784 --> 01:15:01,845
so we're gonna give him,
you know, the treatment he needs. "

1074
01:15:02,755 --> 01:15:05,656
<i>- How are you doing now?
- I'm healthy now,</i>

1075
01:15:05,725 --> 01:15:07,784
but I had three months
of chemotherapy.

1076
01:15:07,861 --> 01:15:11,661
So after three months, I saw my doctor
and he said, "You wanna go back to work?"

1077
01:15:11,731 --> 01:15:14,222
I said, "No, I don't feel like it. "

1078
01:15:14,300 --> 01:15:17,269
"Right now, I'm not ready. "
He said, "How much do you need?"

1079
01:15:17,337 --> 01:15:20,568
I said, "Well, I don't know. "
He said, "Would three months be OK?"

1080
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:23,302
I said, "I think three months
would be fine. "

1081
01:15:23,376 --> 01:15:27,972
He said, "OK, so take three months off. "
So he wrote me a note

1082
01:15:28,047 --> 01:15:30,709
that I gave to my employer
to make sure I got paid.

1083
01:15:31,751 --> 01:15:36,279
- So I went to the south of France...
- Wait a minute, three months off with pay?

1084
01:15:36,356 --> 01:15:38,324
Yes. Yes.

1085
01:15:38,391 --> 01:15:43,385
I get 65% paid by the government,

1086
01:15:43,463 --> 01:15:47,194
and then the other 35%
is paid by my employer.

1087
01:15:47,267 --> 01:15:50,293
To make sure you get 100%.

1088
01:15:51,037 --> 01:15:56,031
So it was April, it was spring again. So
I started right away, sucking up some sun.

1089
01:15:56,109 --> 01:16:01,877
And that really helped me a lot,
to recharge my batteries.

1090
01:16:01,948 --> 01:16:06,749
I mean, it was like night and day. In three
months, I went from a 95-year-old man

1091
01:16:06,819 --> 01:16:09,947
to a 35-year-old man again.

1092
01:16:10,023 --> 01:16:13,789
But that's because I had that time
to take care of myself.

1093
01:16:19,399 --> 01:16:25,702
I'm not in a position to make any judgment
concerning the American system.

1094
01:16:25,772 --> 01:16:29,003
I think the United States
is a great, great country.

1095
01:16:29,075 --> 01:16:31,908
Americans are great people.
I really love them.

1096
01:16:31,978 --> 01:16:37,177
But as a doctor first, as a citizen second,

1097
01:16:37,250 --> 01:16:39,775
and eventually, as a patient third,

1098
01:16:39,852 --> 01:16:42,286
I'm very glad to be in France.

1099
01:16:43,022 --> 01:16:45,149
It's kind of a luxury here.

1100
01:16:45,224 --> 01:16:49,422
You are sick, you step in a hospital,
you get the care you need.

1101
01:16:49,495 --> 01:16:52,760
It doesn't depend on your premiums.
It depends on what you need.

1102
01:16:52,832 --> 01:16:55,801
One of the principles is solidarity.

1103
01:16:55,868 --> 01:17:00,237
People who are better off
pay for those who are worse off.

1104
01:17:01,074 --> 01:17:04,805
You pay according to your means
and you receive according to your needs.

1105
01:17:04,877 --> 01:17:08,404
<i>Do you think
that will ever work in America?</i>

1106
01:17:08,481 --> 01:17:10,346
No.

1107
01:17:10,416 --> 01:17:14,512
<i>He could barely contain
his seething anti-Americanism.</i>

1108
01:17:14,587 --> 01:17:18,614
<i>And I just didn't want
to listen to any more of it.</i>

1109
01:17:22,562 --> 01:17:26,828
<i>So I found a group of Americans
currently living in Paris.</i>

1110
01:17:26,899 --> 01:17:30,027
<i>Who I know would tell me the truth.</i>

1111
01:17:30,103 --> 01:17:33,504
I was diagnosed five years ago
with Type I diabetes.

1112
01:17:33,573 --> 01:17:38,738
<i>- I was a bit nervous to tell them I had...
- To tell the French?</i>

1113
01:17:38,811 --> 01:17:41,939
There's a place to check off
if you have a chronic condition.

1114
01:17:42,015 --> 01:17:45,007
I was nervous that they
were going to charge me more.

1115
01:17:45,084 --> 01:17:48,884
And instead, I went into a hospital,
and had round-the-clock care.

1116
01:17:48,955 --> 01:17:52,550
And they do an amazing amount
of preventative care.

1117
01:17:52,625 --> 01:17:55,059
They asked if you have
a preexisting condition,

1118
01:17:55,128 --> 01:17:58,291
not to punish you,
but to give you more help?

1119
01:17:58,364 --> 01:18:00,525
- Yes.
- I was in the hospital for a year.

1120
01:18:00,600 --> 01:18:06,561
As soon as I was in, it was,
"Well, don't worry, just rest. "

1121
01:18:06,639 --> 01:18:10,473
- People said "Rest. "
- How many sick days do you get a year?

1122
01:18:10,543 --> 01:18:13,239
- I think it's unlimited.
- Unlimited?

1123
01:18:13,312 --> 01:18:17,544
Yes. How can you limit sick days?
If you're sick, you're sick.

1124
01:18:17,617 --> 01:18:21,883
I've gone to emergency rooms
numerous times, with four boys.

1125
01:18:21,954 --> 01:18:24,320
And have never waited
more than an hour. Never.

1126
01:18:24,390 --> 01:18:27,188
I can call and somebody comes
to the house in half an hour.

1127
01:18:27,260 --> 01:18:30,752
No way? Making a house call?
At your place?

1128
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:33,526
How many of you have had
a house call from a doctor? No!

1129
01:18:33,599 --> 01:18:36,727
- 3:00am last Friday.
- And how much does this cost you?

1130
01:18:36,803 --> 01:18:39,067
- Nothing.
- What's this service called?

1131
01:18:44,544 --> 01:18:45,670
Where are we going?

1132
01:18:48,748 --> 01:18:51,911
We are going to see a man
who has abdominal pain.

1133
01:18:51,984 --> 01:18:54,145
- Abdominal pain?
- Yeah.

1134
01:19:35,862 --> 01:19:39,127
- Where do we go next?
- The next visit?

1135
01:20:12,798 --> 01:20:15,266
I say to anyone who asks me
why I'm in this country

1136
01:20:15,334 --> 01:20:19,327
is that I think it's one of the friendliest
countries that I know of.

1137
01:20:19,405 --> 01:20:23,569
And talk about family values -
I mean, childcare, healthcare...

1138
01:20:23,643 --> 01:20:25,474
We don't pay for day care.

1139
01:20:25,545 --> 01:20:29,948
The day care where I send my daughter -
and I was a teacher - standards are high.

1140
01:20:33,586 --> 01:20:37,647
So how much does it cost you to have
two children here? How much per hour?

1141
01:20:44,130 --> 01:20:46,860
<i>Are you happy
with how they're cared for?</i>

1142
01:21:02,448 --> 01:21:08,409
Here, my kids are sure that they are going
to get a certain level of care, education,

1143
01:21:08,487 --> 01:21:12,082
<i>- college I don't have to worry about...
- What do you mean?</i>

1144
01:21:12,158 --> 01:21:14,183
<i>- It's free.
- You're kidding?</i>

1145
01:21:14,260 --> 01:21:17,252
<i>- You can get a college education for free.
- No way.</i>

1146
01:21:17,330 --> 01:21:20,595
- Yes.
- There's not a sense of desperation.

1147
01:21:20,666 --> 01:21:22,725
They rest, they enjoy life.

1148
01:21:22,802 --> 01:21:26,465
They spend time with their kids,
there's vacations, family time.

1149
01:21:26,539 --> 01:21:29,702
- How many weeks of paid vacation?
- Minimum five weeks.

1150
01:21:29,775 --> 01:21:32,608
Five weeks?
Minimum of five weeks?

1151
01:21:32,678 --> 01:21:36,045
If you work for a large company,
you get sometimes eight, ten weeks.

1152
01:21:36,115 --> 01:21:39,983
- Remember that there is a 35-hour week.
- The productivity rate is so high here.

1153
01:21:40,052 --> 01:21:43,249
<i>I read it was higher
than the United States.</i>

1154
01:21:43,322 --> 01:21:47,281
If they're working more than 35 hours
a week, they'll get extra days off.

1155
01:21:47,360 --> 01:21:49,794
That is for part-time
and full-time employees.

1156
01:21:49,862 --> 01:21:53,423
You get five weeks paid vacation
even if you're a part-time employee?

1157
01:21:53,499 --> 01:21:54,932
- Of course.
- Everybody.

1158
01:21:55,001 --> 01:21:58,994
If you get married, you get an extra week
or seven days for your honeymoon.

1159
01:21:59,071 --> 01:22:02,472
- In addition to your five weeks.
- You're paid to take your honeymoon?

1160
01:22:02,541 --> 01:22:04,236
Also if you move.

1161
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:07,006
You mean if you move
from one apartment to another?

1162
01:22:07,079 --> 01:22:08,546
You get one day.

1163
01:22:08,614 --> 01:22:12,948
- You get a day to move and they pay you?
- These are the laws here.

1164
01:22:13,019 --> 01:22:16,182
When my daughter was three months old,
they sent somebody to you

1165
01:22:16,255 --> 01:22:21,090
to give you tips on what to do
with your child, every single day, for free.

1166
01:22:21,160 --> 01:22:24,561
And they'll come to your house
and do your laundry!

1167
01:22:24,630 --> 01:22:27,155
- They will! Sure!
- No!

1168
01:22:27,233 --> 01:22:29,224
Stop! Stop!

1169
01:22:29,302 --> 01:22:32,396
- When you have a baby.
- When you have a baby.

1170
01:22:34,674 --> 01:22:36,073
What are you doing?

1171
01:22:42,214 --> 01:22:43,806
You from the government?

1172
01:22:46,919 --> 01:22:50,582
- Can she do anything else?
- If I want, yes.

1173
01:22:50,656 --> 01:22:53,955
She's, of course,
taking care of the children.

1174
01:22:54,026 --> 01:22:59,487
And I think if I ask her
to prepare a meal for tonight,

1175
01:22:59,565 --> 01:23:01,760
she can do it.

1176
01:23:07,006 --> 01:23:09,167
No problem.

1177
01:23:09,241 --> 01:23:11,869
She's coming twice a week.

1178
01:23:12,812 --> 01:23:15,372
Four hours a day.
So I can do everything I want,

1179
01:23:15,448 --> 01:23:19,316
for me, for the house,
for my husband, during four hours.

1180
01:23:19,385 --> 01:23:21,376
It's very precious for me.

1181
01:23:21,987 --> 01:23:25,184
You don't have any associations?
Nothing to help like that?

1182
01:23:25,257 --> 01:23:29,921
No. Nobody from the government
comes to your home in America

1183
01:23:29,995 --> 01:23:34,557
and does your laundry for you,
if you're a new mother.

1184
01:23:34,633 --> 01:23:37,227
- It's difficult.
- Yeah.

1185
01:23:37,803 --> 01:23:42,365
<i>Something that I experience
a lot of with my own family is guilt.</i>

1186
01:23:42,441 --> 01:23:44,739
Guilt for being here almost,

1187
01:23:44,810 --> 01:23:49,179
and seeing the advantages and
the benefits I have at such a young age.

1188
01:23:49,248 --> 01:23:54,982
Things that my parents worked their whole
life for and haven't come close to touching.

1189
01:23:55,054 --> 01:23:57,921
It's really hard
to know that you're here

1190
01:23:57,990 --> 01:24:01,619
in a very privileged position,
you know, not living the highlife,

1191
01:24:01,694 --> 01:24:07,428
but in comparison, definitely.
And that seems completely unfair.

1192
01:24:08,234 --> 01:24:11,203
One of the things
that keeps everything running here

1193
01:24:11,270 --> 01:24:13,864
is that the government
is afraid of the people.

1194
01:24:13,939 --> 01:24:18,638
They're afraid of protests,
they're afraid of reactions from the people.

1195
01:24:18,711 --> 01:24:24,274
In the States, people are afraid of the
government. They're afraid of acting up.

1196
01:24:24,350 --> 01:24:27,114
They're afraid of protesting,
afraid of getting out.

1197
01:24:27,186 --> 01:24:29,381
In France, that's what people do.

1198
01:25:10,396 --> 01:25:13,888
<i>Free college education.
Free medical care.</i>

1199
01:25:13,966 --> 01:25:15,957
<i>Government-issued nannies.</i>

1200
01:25:16,035 --> 01:25:19,562
<i>I began to wonder
how do they pay for all this?</i>

1201
01:25:19,638 --> 01:25:23,335
<i>And then I realized
they're drowning in taxes!</i>

1202
01:25:23,409 --> 01:25:27,539
<i>I wanted to see what effect
this would have on a nice French family.</i>

1203
01:25:27,613 --> 01:25:29,808
<i>So I went to find out.</i>

1204
01:25:33,752 --> 01:25:36,550
- Hello. Welcome.
- Hello. Thank you.

1205
01:25:37,389 --> 01:25:39,857
It's very nice.

1206
01:25:49,068 --> 01:25:51,901
- It's the news.
- Yes.

1207
01:25:53,706 --> 01:25:58,439
What is your combined income for
the two of you together for, say one month?

1208
01:26:03,883 --> 01:26:07,011
All right. You're an engineer
and she's an assistant? Not bad.

1209
01:26:17,096 --> 01:26:19,087
<i>How much is your mortgage?</i>

1210
01:26:27,239 --> 01:26:30,072
<i>- How many cars do you own?
- Two.</i>

1211
01:26:30,142 --> 01:26:32,406
<i>Do you owe money
from medical bills?</i>

1212
01:26:34,947 --> 01:26:37,415
Is there any other debt? Loans, anything?

1213
01:26:38,851 --> 01:26:43,914
<i>- Only the apartment.
- What are your other expenses?</i>

1214
01:26:43,989 --> 01:26:45,980
The fish.

1215
01:26:47,326 --> 01:26:49,760
Fish. Vegetables.

1216
01:26:49,828 --> 01:26:52,388
Vegetables are a big
monthly expense for you.

1217
01:26:52,464 --> 01:26:56,230
- Yes. And fruit. Yogurt.
- Yogurt.

1218
01:26:56,769 --> 01:26:58,566
What are your other big expenses?

1219
01:27:00,239 --> 01:27:02,639
Very important.

1220
01:27:17,456 --> 01:27:20,050
<i>- Kenya?
- We liked.</i>

1221
01:27:20,125 --> 01:27:23,026
<i>- Are you happy?
- Yes.</i>

1222
01:27:42,081 --> 01:27:46,347
<i>After seeing all this.
I began to wonder.</i>

1223
01:27:46,418 --> 01:27:49,512
<i>Was there a reason
our government and our media</i>

1224
01:27:49,588 --> 01:27:52,386
<i>wants us to hate the French?</i>

1225
01:27:57,596 --> 01:28:01,157
<i>Are they worried
we might like the French?</i>

1226
01:28:05,738 --> 01:28:08,332
<i>Or like their ways of doing things?</i>

1227
01:28:16,548 --> 01:28:20,712
<i>It was enough to make me
put away my freedom fries.</i>

1228
01:28:30,863 --> 01:28:33,093
<i>Meanwhile. Back at home.</i>

1229
01:28:33,165 --> 01:28:35,998
<i>Hospitals had found a new way
to deal with patients</i>

1230
01:28:36,068 --> 01:28:38,195
<i>who didn't have health insurance</i>

1231
01:28:38,270 --> 01:28:40,500
<i>and couldn't pay their bill.</i>

1232
01:28:42,374 --> 01:28:48,040
I was standing against the wall and I saw
a cab do a U-turn and pull up to the curb.

1233
01:28:48,113 --> 01:28:51,844
I watched to see what was happening
'cause I had a feeling what would occur,

1234
01:28:51,917 --> 01:28:54,044
'cause it's not a new thing.

1235
01:28:54,119 --> 01:28:56,952
They pulled up right here
by this yellow fire hydrant

1236
01:28:57,022 --> 01:29:00,150
and dropped Carol off
and immediately pulled away.

1237
01:29:00,225 --> 01:29:04,059
And as soon as they pulled away, she
walked out into the street about up to here.

1238
01:29:04,129 --> 01:29:08,190
She then walked all the way down to the
driveway down here, completely confused,

1239
01:29:08,267 --> 01:29:11,703
has no shoes on whatsoever
and just a hospital gown.

1240
01:29:11,770 --> 01:29:13,431
And those gowns are thin.

1241
01:29:13,939 --> 01:29:18,239
That's when one of our staff members went
and asked Carol if she needed assistance

1242
01:29:18,310 --> 01:29:22,246
and found out that she was disoriented
and didn't know where she was.

1243
01:30:36,955 --> 01:30:41,892
Kaiser Permanente in Bellflower hospital
had put her in a cab

1244
01:30:41,960 --> 01:30:45,896
and directed them
to bring her to this drop-off point.

1245
01:30:45,964 --> 01:30:50,526
But the names of the hospitals had been
taken off both bracelets before she arrived.

1246
01:30:50,602 --> 01:30:55,767
I have seen others that have come through
our doors who have IVs still in their arms.

1247
01:30:55,841 --> 01:30:58,537
<i>They told me that.
At their shelter alone.</i>

1248
01:30:58,610 --> 01:31:02,205
<i>Over 50 patients
had been dumped there by hospitals.</i>

1249
01:31:02,281 --> 01:31:05,512
The options are few. We either open
the front door and let them out,

1250
01:31:05,584 --> 01:31:08,109
which is not the humane thing to do,

1251
01:31:08,187 --> 01:31:11,122
or we try to find someplace for them to go.

1252
01:31:11,190 --> 01:31:14,421
And right now,
skid row is the best bed in town.

1253
01:31:16,061 --> 01:31:18,154
<i>The night
before we were there.</i>

1254
01:31:18,230 --> 01:31:22,462
<i>The county hospital run by
the University of Southern California.</i>

1255
01:31:22,534 --> 01:31:25,025
<i>One of the richest private schools
in the country.</i>

1256
01:31:25,103 --> 01:31:28,402
<i>Dumped another patient off on the curb.</i>

1257
01:31:29,408 --> 01:31:33,105
<i>A woman unable to pay her hospital bill.</i>

1258
01:31:35,814 --> 01:31:38,146
- Do you know how you got here?
- In the cab.

1259
01:31:38,217 --> 01:31:40,447
- In the cab?
- From General Hospital.

1260
01:31:40,519 --> 01:31:42,680
They gave him the voucher.

1261
01:31:44,890 --> 01:31:49,293
He dropped me off there,
he actually forced me out of the car.

1262
01:31:49,361 --> 01:31:53,092
Ma'am, are you in pain right now?
Are you in pain?

1263
01:31:53,165 --> 01:31:55,429
- Yes.
- Is there anything we can do?

1264
01:31:55,500 --> 01:31:58,799
She, at this time, has broken ribs,
broken collarbone,

1265
01:31:58,871 --> 01:32:02,102
and stitches that are not completely healed

1266
01:32:02,174 --> 01:32:04,802
across the top of her head
and on the side of her head.

1267
01:32:04,877 --> 01:32:08,005
Now let me ask you, ma'am.
Before they dropped you off,

1268
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:10,913
did they ask you
if you knew where you were going?

1269
01:32:10,983 --> 01:32:12,041
No.

1270
01:32:12,117 --> 01:32:14,984
They didn't ask you any questions
about your orientation,

1271
01:32:15,053 --> 01:32:18,250
or whether or not
you knew what was going on?

1272
01:32:18,323 --> 01:32:21,918
No, they just told me
to take care of myself.

1273
01:32:25,264 --> 01:32:31,134
<i>May I take a minute to ask
a question that's been on my mind?</i>

1274
01:32:31,203 --> 01:32:33,364
<i>Who are we?</i>

1275
01:32:34,506 --> 01:32:37,066
<i>Is this what we've become?</i>

1276
01:32:37,142 --> 01:32:41,977
<i>A nation that dumps its own citizens like
so much garbage on the side of the curb.</i>

1277
01:32:42,047 --> 01:32:45,915
<i>Because they can't pay
their hospital bill?</i>

1278
01:32:46,652 --> 01:32:51,453
<i>I always thought. And believe to this day.
That we're a good and generous people.</i>

1279
01:32:51,523 --> 01:32:54,219
This is what we do
if somebody's in trouble.

1280
01:32:54,293 --> 01:32:57,592
Anybody gets sick,
we all get together and help.

1281
01:32:57,663 --> 01:32:59,858
<i>People with a good heart...</i>

1282
01:32:59,932 --> 01:33:05,097
<i>You feel like you're sacrificing,
but you get a blessing from doing this.</i>

1283
01:33:05,170 --> 01:33:06,762
<i>...and a good soul.</i>

1284
01:33:06,838 --> 01:33:11,298
We've got a lot of support and we're gonna
all keep working until we locate this child.

1285
01:33:11,376 --> 01:33:15,813
<i>Neighbors quick to lend a helping
hand to anyone in their hour of need.</i>

1286
01:33:15,881 --> 01:33:19,749
I deliver meals to them,
but my life has been so blessed

1287
01:33:19,818 --> 01:33:23,379
that this is just the least that I can do.

1288
01:33:23,455 --> 01:33:26,447
<i>They say that you
can judge a society</i>

1289
01:33:26,525 --> 01:33:30,586
<i>by how it treats those
who are the worst off.</i>

1290
01:33:30,662 --> 01:33:37,261
<i>But is the opposite true? That you can
judge a society by how it treats its best?</i>

1291
01:33:38,804 --> 01:33:40,863
<i>Its heroes?</i>

1292
01:33:41,239 --> 01:33:44,640
<i>The firefighters and police,
rescue and recovery workers</i>

1293
01:33:44,710 --> 01:33:46,974
have responded with true heroism.

1294
01:33:48,213 --> 01:33:53,515
It was their initial heroism
that thwarted the objectives of the terrorists.

1295
01:33:53,585 --> 01:33:58,989
Without regard, in many instances,
to their own safety and security.

1296
01:33:59,057 --> 01:34:04,620
<i>- They truly are heroes.
- We owe them everything!</i>

1297
01:34:04,696 --> 01:34:08,928
Here they are, the men and women who
have been on the front lines for New York,

1298
01:34:08,967 --> 01:34:14,837
and for all of us in America!
Tonight is dedicated to you!

1299
01:34:21,413 --> 01:34:25,372
Don't forget about the raffles going on
over there - one dollar each.

1300
01:34:26,018 --> 01:34:28,384
I spent two and a half years down there.

1301
01:34:28,453 --> 01:34:31,854
I got upper and lower
breathing problems.

1302
01:34:31,923 --> 01:34:35,484
I need a double lung transplant,
but was diagnosed with pulmonary fibrosis.

1303
01:34:35,560 --> 01:34:40,259
I haven't slept in a bed in over five years,
I sleep on a chair with a blanket,

1304
01:34:40,332 --> 01:34:42,323
because if I lay down I can't breathe.

1305
01:34:42,401 --> 01:34:45,564
<i>There were hundreds
of rescue workers on 911</i>

1306
01:34:45,637 --> 01:34:47,764
<i>who were not city employees.</i>

1307
01:34:47,839 --> 01:34:52,208
<i>But rather ran down to Ground Zero
on their own to help out.</i>

1308
01:34:52,277 --> 01:34:54,541
We need volunteers for first aid!

1309
01:34:54,613 --> 01:34:58,947
<i>And many developed
serious respiratory illnesses.</i>

1310
01:34:59,017 --> 01:35:01,212
<i>That's when the government said:</i>

1311
01:35:01,286 --> 01:35:05,985
<i>"They're not our responsibility
because they weren't on our payroll. "</i>

1312
01:35:08,026 --> 01:35:13,259
<i>John Graham is an EMT volunteer
from Paramus. New Jersey.</i>

1313
01:35:13,331 --> 01:35:16,823
<i>He was in Lower Manhattan
when he heard the planes hit.</i>

1314
01:35:16,902 --> 01:35:19,370
<i>And rushed over to help.</i>

1315
01:35:19,438 --> 01:35:22,635
<i>He worked in the rescue effort
for the next few months.</i>

1316
01:35:22,707 --> 01:35:27,371
<i>But then had trouble
receiving benefits for his illness.</i>

1317
01:35:27,446 --> 01:35:32,884
They just deny you for any reason.
It's just a terrible waiting game.

1318
01:35:32,951 --> 01:35:37,047
I really feel like
they're waiting for you to die.

1319
01:35:37,122 --> 01:35:40,956
It's terrible.
I never thought that we would do this,

1320
01:35:41,026 --> 01:35:43,927
that the United States would do this.

1321
01:35:43,995 --> 01:35:48,295
<i>William Maher is a volunteer
member of New Jersey's fire service.</i>

1322
01:35:48,366 --> 01:35:51,733
<i>He spent to months
working near The Pile at Ground Zero.</i>

1323
01:35:51,803 --> 01:35:55,933
<i>Recovering bodies or body parts.
And it deeply affected him.</i>

1324
01:35:56,007 --> 01:35:59,443
I'm experiencing
a lot of disturbing dreams,

1325
01:35:59,511 --> 01:36:01,706
or whatever you'd like to call them,

1326
01:36:01,780 --> 01:36:04,681
and it affected
what I was doing at night,

1327
01:36:04,749 --> 01:36:06,876
and unaware of it because I was asleep

1328
01:36:06,952 --> 01:36:09,512
and I just kept
grinding and grinding my teeth.

1329
01:36:09,588 --> 01:36:12,421
The upper fronts are damaged,
practically beyond repair,

1330
01:36:12,491 --> 01:36:15,483
because of my constant grinding
over the last three years.

1331
01:36:15,560 --> 01:36:20,054
I've been before a workers' comp board
already for the 9/11 volunteers' fund.

1332
01:36:20,132 --> 01:36:26,196
I've been denied three times, and hopefully
I will go on my fourth appeal soon,

1333
01:36:26,271 --> 01:36:30,571
if I can get the necessary documentation.

1334
01:36:31,209 --> 01:36:34,508
<i>Of course.
There was a $50 million fund set up</i>

1335
01:36:34,579 --> 01:36:37,207
<i>supposedly to help rescue workers.</i>

1336
01:36:37,282 --> 01:36:40,615
Ladies and gentlemen,
the governor of New York, George Pataki.

1337
01:36:40,685 --> 01:36:44,246
<i>But the government.
Like the health insurance companies.</i>

1338
01:36:44,322 --> 01:36:47,849
<i>Made it very difficult
for people to receive help.</i>

1339
01:36:47,926 --> 01:36:51,862
You have to have spent
a certain amount of time at Ground Zero,

1340
01:36:51,930 --> 01:36:54,990
you have to be able to establish that.

1341
01:36:55,066 --> 01:36:59,799
You do have to file an affidavit
within the next year,

1342
01:36:59,871 --> 01:37:02,339
relating your work experiences
at Ground Zero.

1343
01:37:02,407 --> 01:37:05,467
And then, even with all of that,
it's not automatic.

1344
01:37:05,544 --> 01:37:08,411
There is a presumption
when certain illnesses occur,

1345
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:13,281
but that presumption can be rebutted
by other medical evidence.

1346
01:37:13,351 --> 01:37:17,549
We think it is a very fair approach
that protects our heroes.

1347
01:37:24,663 --> 01:37:25,857
I'm sorry.

1348
01:37:25,931 --> 01:37:31,096
<i>Reggie Cervantes was
a volunteer medical technician on 911.</i>

1349
01:37:31,169 --> 01:37:37,472
Nothing makes it go away sometimes.
Not water, not cough medicine, anything.

1350
01:37:37,542 --> 01:37:43,970
It's just burning in my throat and irritated
and it just gets me to coughing.

1351
01:37:44,049 --> 01:37:49,715
Sometimes I have trouble breathing
'cause I can't catch my breath.

1352
01:37:50,655 --> 01:37:54,147
<i>Reggie spent her days
at Ground Zero carrying bodies</i>

1353
01:37:54,226 --> 01:37:56,854
<i>and treating other rescue workers.</i>

1354
01:37:56,928 --> 01:38:00,125
My airway was totally burnt
that first week,

1355
01:38:00,198 --> 01:38:02,689
and I had trouble breathing by then.

1356
01:38:02,767 --> 01:38:05,600
But we wanted to see
if we could dig anybody up alive,

1357
01:38:05,670 --> 01:38:11,472
we wanted to see if we had lost anybody,
if we were still missing somebody.

1358
01:38:12,043 --> 01:38:16,104
I wanted to help.
I was trained for this.

1359
01:38:16,181 --> 01:38:20,982
You know, you see somebody
who is in need, you help 'em.

1360
01:38:22,187 --> 01:38:25,452
<i>Reggie had difficulty
getting treatment.</i>

1361
01:38:25,523 --> 01:38:28,321
<i>Too sick to work and with no income.</i>

1362
01:38:28,393 --> 01:38:30,520
<i>She was forced to quit her job.</i>

1363
01:38:30,595 --> 01:38:35,532
<i>And used her savings
to move her and her kids out of the city.</i>

1364
01:38:37,168 --> 01:38:39,966
It's hard to figure out
how you're supposed to get help.

1365
01:38:40,038 --> 01:38:43,439
We're trying to go about it the right way.

1366
01:38:44,476 --> 01:38:46,842
But we're ignored.

1367
01:38:46,911 --> 01:38:52,042
<i>But not everyone after 911
was ignored by the government.</i>

1368
01:38:52,117 --> 01:38:57,248
We're now approaching the five-year
anniversary of the 9/11 attacks.

1369
01:38:57,322 --> 01:39:01,156
So I'm announcing today
that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed,

1370
01:39:01,226 --> 01:39:04,593
Abu Zubaydah, Ramzi Binalshibh,

1371
01:39:04,663 --> 01:39:07,689
and 11 other terrorists in CIA custody,

1372
01:39:07,766 --> 01:39:11,634
have been transferred to
the US naval base at Guantanamo Bay.

1373
01:39:13,505 --> 01:39:18,772
<i>On that island are some of the
world's most hardened enemy combatants.</i>

1374
01:39:18,843 --> 01:39:22,836
<i>These detainees are deadly
and include the 20th hijacker,</i>

1375
01:39:22,914 --> 01:39:26,577
as well as a number of Osama bin Laden's
personal bodyguards

1376
01:39:26,651 --> 01:39:30,849
and others who had a direct role
in the September 11 attacks.

1377
01:39:31,523 --> 01:39:37,291
The kind of people held at Guantanamo
include terrorist trainers, bomb-makers...

1378
01:39:37,362 --> 01:39:43,062
Many of them have American blood on
their hands and are the elite of al-Qaida.

1379
01:39:43,134 --> 01:39:45,432
It seems to me we have an obligation

1380
01:39:45,503 --> 01:39:50,463
to treat these individuals
as enemy combatants.

1381
01:39:50,542 --> 01:39:55,036
<i>And then I learned
it wasn't all bad news at Gitmo.</i>

1382
01:40:00,385 --> 01:40:04,151
<i>Detainees representing a threat
to our national security</i>

1383
01:40:04,222 --> 01:40:06,747
are given access
to top-notch medical facilities.

1384
01:40:06,825 --> 01:40:11,762
They have acute care 24 hours a day,
in which surgical procedures,

1385
01:40:11,830 --> 01:40:16,324
everything can be performed right there
in the detainee camps.

1386
01:40:16,401 --> 01:40:18,892
This is the dental clinic,
or the health clinic.

1387
01:40:18,970 --> 01:40:23,498
We have a physical therapy department,
X- ray capabilities with digital X-rays.

1388
01:40:23,575 --> 01:40:25,702
We have one single operating room.

1389
01:40:25,777 --> 01:40:31,010
Health personnel to detainee ratio
is one to four, remarkably high.

1390
01:40:31,082 --> 01:40:35,382
They do sick call on the blocks three times
per week, care for them there if they can,

1391
01:40:35,453 --> 01:40:38,581
or bring that detainee back to the clinic
to be seen there.

1392
01:40:38,656 --> 01:40:40,715
Screening for cancer has taken place.

1393
01:40:40,792 --> 01:40:45,456
Colonoscopy is a procedure which
is performed there on a routine basis.

1394
01:40:45,530 --> 01:40:48,795
We have diabetes,
high blood pressure, high cholesterol.

1395
01:40:48,867 --> 01:40:51,802
We monitor the weight
and nutrition of the detainees,

1396
01:40:51,870 --> 01:40:55,499
so that we can track those detainees
to make sure we see them frequently,

1397
01:40:55,573 --> 01:40:57,973
monitoring their labs
and their overall health.

1398
01:40:58,042 --> 01:41:04,413
Their medical attention... They get way
better medical treatment than I've ever had.

1399
01:41:04,482 --> 01:41:08,851
- You think it's as good as most US HMOs?
- Certainly very similar and as good, sir.

1400
01:41:08,920 --> 01:41:13,016
<i>I leave with an impression
that healthcare there is clearly better</i>

1401
01:41:13,091 --> 01:41:15,355
than they received at home,

1402
01:41:15,427 --> 01:41:20,330
and as good as many people receive
in the United States of America.

1403
01:41:20,398 --> 01:41:24,801
<i>Wow! So there is actually
one place on American soil</i>

1404
01:41:24,869 --> 01:41:27,963
<i>that had free universal healthcare.</i>

1405
01:41:28,039 --> 01:41:30,507
<i>That's all I needed to know.</i>

1406
01:41:32,410 --> 01:41:34,640
<i>I went down to Miami. Florida.</i>

1407
01:41:35,647 --> 01:41:37,979
<i>Got myself a boat.</i>

1408
01:41:38,450 --> 01:41:40,645
<i>And loaded up Bill.</i>

1409
01:41:40,718 --> 01:41:43,653
<i>And Reggie and John.</i>

1410
01:41:44,155 --> 01:41:45,918
John, welcome, sir.

1411
01:41:45,990 --> 01:41:50,791
<i>And anyone else I could find who needed
to see a doctor and couldn't afford one.</i>

1412
01:41:50,862 --> 01:41:54,821
<i>So many people showed up.
I had to get a couple extra boats.</i>

1413
01:41:54,899 --> 01:41:59,768
<i>And I called up Donna Smith from Denver.
Who is now on nine different medications.</i>

1414
01:41:59,838 --> 01:42:02,500
<i>And asked her
if she'd like to come along.</i>

1415
01:42:02,574 --> 01:42:06,635
<i>I figured she'd like to get out
of her daughter's basement for a while.</i>

1416
01:42:06,711 --> 01:42:08,042
All right, let's go.

1417
01:42:24,796 --> 01:42:28,960
Which way to Guantanamo Bay?
Can we go?

1418
01:42:29,033 --> 01:42:32,196
We're not going to Cuba!
We're going to America!

1419
01:42:32,804 --> 01:42:35,329
It's American soil!

1420
01:43:11,342 --> 01:43:13,333
We made it.

1421
01:43:28,226 --> 01:43:31,093
There it is.
There's the runway.

1422
01:43:31,162 --> 01:43:33,892
That's the prison over there
where the detainees are.

1423
01:43:33,965 --> 01:43:38,493
<i>- We're very close.
- Yeah, we're very close.</i>

1424
01:43:40,405 --> 01:43:44,171
The white building is the hospital, I think.

1425
01:43:44,676 --> 01:43:46,667
OK, let's go.

1426
01:43:51,115 --> 01:43:57,645
<i>We commandeered a fishing boat
and sailed into Guantanamo Bay.</i>

1427
01:43:57,722 --> 01:44:02,625
<i>As we approached the line in the water
beteen the American and Cuban side.</i>

1428
01:44:02,694 --> 01:44:05,595
<i>We were told to be careful for mines.</i>

1429
01:44:08,232 --> 01:44:12,828
Permission to enter.
I have three 9/11 rescue workers.

1430
01:44:12,904 --> 01:44:15,805
They need some medical attention.

1431
01:44:19,911 --> 01:44:24,644
These are 9/11 rescue workers!
They just want some medical attention!

1432
01:44:24,716 --> 01:44:28,015
The same kind that al-Qaida is getting.

1433
01:44:30,121 --> 01:44:34,785
They don't want any more than
you're giving the evildoers, just the same!

1434
01:44:35,994 --> 01:44:37,859
Hello.

1435
01:44:37,929 --> 01:44:42,730
<i>No one in the guard tower was
responding and then we heard a siren.</i>

1436
01:44:42,800 --> 01:44:45,564
<i>We figured it was time
to get out of here.</i>

1437
01:44:45,637 --> 01:44:50,472
<i>But what was I supposed to do with these
sick people and no one to help them?</i>

1438
01:44:50,541 --> 01:44:54,807
<i>I mean. Here we were stuck in some
godforsaken Third World country.</i>

1439
01:44:54,879 --> 01:45:00,340
<i>And communists. No less. When I was
a kid. These people wanted to kill us.</i>

1440
01:45:00,418 --> 01:45:02,750
<i>What was I supposed to do?</i>

1441
01:45:22,640 --> 01:45:27,009
Excuse me, we're looking for a doctor.
Is there a doctor here in Cuba?

1442
01:45:27,078 --> 01:45:28,875
Any doctors?

1443
01:45:34,719 --> 01:45:35,879
All in this one block?

1444
01:45:42,160 --> 01:45:44,594
All right, thank you very much.
Thank you.

1445
01:45:45,096 --> 01:45:50,261
<i>OK. OK. I know what you're
thinking. Cuba is where Lucifer lives.</i>

1446
01:45:53,171 --> 01:45:58,473
<i>The worse place on Earth.
The most evil nation ever created.</i>

1447
01:45:58,543 --> 01:46:03,242
<i>How do we know that? 'Cause that's
what we've been told for over 45 years.</i>

1448
01:46:03,314 --> 01:46:07,216
A series of offensive missile sites
can be none other

1449
01:46:07,285 --> 01:46:11,881
than to provide a nuclear strike capability
against the western hemisphere.

1450
01:46:11,956 --> 01:46:17,155
I'm not gonna yield until Fidel Castro
allows freedom on the island.

1451
01:46:17,228 --> 01:46:20,129
That's a...
You can count on it.

1452
01:46:21,833 --> 01:46:24,165
Put it in the bank.

1453
01:46:25,369 --> 01:46:28,463
<i>It seems that
what really bugged us about Castro</i>

1454
01:46:28,539 --> 01:46:31,940
<i>was that he overthrew
the dictator that we liked.</i>

1455
01:46:32,009 --> 01:46:36,241
<i>And replaced him with a guy
we didn't like - himself.</i>

1456
01:46:37,181 --> 01:46:41,379
<i>And so now. After all these years.
One thing is clear -</i>

1457
01:46:41,452 --> 01:46:45,582
<i>the Cuban people
have free universal healthcare.</i>

1458
01:46:45,656 --> 01:46:50,320
<i>They've become known as having not
only one of the best healthcare systems.</i>

1459
01:46:50,394 --> 01:46:53,852
<i>But as being one of the most generous
countries in providing doctors</i>

1460
01:46:53,931 --> 01:46:57,992
<i>and medical equipment
to Third World countries.</i>

1461
01:46:58,069 --> 01:47:03,063
<i>In the US. Healthcare costs
run nearly $ 7.000 per person.</i>

1462
01:47:03,141 --> 01:47:07,202
<i>But in Cuba. They spend only $ 251.</i>

1463
01:47:07,278 --> 01:47:12,238
<i>And yet the Cubans are able to have
a lower infant mortality rate than the US.</i>

1464
01:47:12,316 --> 01:47:16,150
<i>A longer average life span
than the United States.</i>

1465
01:47:16,220 --> 01:47:18,780
<i>They believe in preventive medicine.</i>

1466
01:47:18,856 --> 01:47:22,815
<i>And it seems like there's a doctor
on every block.</i>

1467
01:47:22,894 --> 01:47:25,658
<i>Their only sin
when it comes to healthcare</i>

1468
01:47:25,730 --> 01:47:29,131
<i>seems to be
that they don't do it for a profit.</i>

1469
01:47:29,200 --> 01:47:33,728
Anybody need medication right now
from the pharmacy?

1470
01:47:37,975 --> 01:47:40,466
- Are you the pharmacist?
- Yes.

1471
01:47:40,545 --> 01:47:42,570
Do you have this?

1472
01:47:44,282 --> 01:47:49,379
<i>- Is this one similar to yours?
- Yeah. It's $120 in the US.</i>

1473
01:47:49,453 --> 01:47:52,013
- This is $120 in the US?
- Yes.

1474
01:47:55,726 --> 01:48:00,095
- How much is that in American dollars?
- It's like five cents.

1475
01:48:00,164 --> 01:48:02,223
- Five cents?
- Yeah. More or less.

1476
01:48:14,745 --> 01:48:18,613
<i>Thank you very much.
Muchas gracias.</i>

1477
01:48:18,683 --> 01:48:20,674
$120 is a lot of money

1478
01:48:20,751 --> 01:48:26,917
when you get $1,000 in social security
disability and need one or two a month.

1479
01:48:26,991 --> 01:48:31,155
Five cents here?
It's like the biggest insult.

1480
01:48:31,229 --> 01:48:33,789
It just doesn't make any sense.

1481
01:48:34,599 --> 01:48:36,931
It doesn't make any sense.

1482
01:48:37,001 --> 01:48:41,438
I wanna fill a suitcase up
and go back home with it.

1483
01:49:05,963 --> 01:49:09,194
<i>I took my group
of sick Americans to a hospital</i>

1484
01:49:09,267 --> 01:49:12,703
<i>to see if they could get some care.</i>

1485
01:49:12,770 --> 01:49:16,297
<i>They didn't ask for money
or an insurance card.</i>

1486
01:49:19,410 --> 01:49:20,638
<i>Just their name...</i>

1487
01:49:22,280 --> 01:49:23,008
<i>and date of birth.</i>

1488
01:49:26,550 --> 01:49:29,849
<i>That was the entire intake session.</i>

1489
01:49:49,340 --> 01:49:52,537
<i>Thank you very much
for doing this.</i>

1490
01:49:54,245 --> 01:49:56,941
<i>I asked them to give us
the same exact care</i>

1491
01:49:57,014 --> 01:49:59,539
<i>they give their fellow Cuban citizens.</i>

1492
01:49:59,617 --> 01:50:02,108
<i>No more. No less.</i>

1493
01:50:02,186 --> 01:50:04,177
<i>And that's what they did.</i>

1494
01:50:04,255 --> 01:50:07,190
I'm Dr. Roque.
I'm an internal medicine specialist.

1495
01:50:07,258 --> 01:50:09,692
- John Graham.
- How are you feeling?

1496
01:50:09,760 --> 01:50:12,092
My lungs hurt. I have pain.

1497
01:50:12,163 --> 01:50:15,360
I get pretty severe nosebleeds at times.

1498
01:50:15,433 --> 01:50:17,424
I get terrible headaches in the night,

1499
01:50:17,501 --> 01:50:20,993
but I haven't been evaluated
for the sleep apnea for nine years.

1500
01:50:21,072 --> 01:50:25,099
- Yeah, I have...
- Many medications for lung problems.

1501
01:50:25,176 --> 01:50:28,009
Almost every medication
for lung problems, I've got.

1502
01:50:28,079 --> 01:50:31,981
After 9/11, things have happened,
my teeth started falling out.

1503
01:50:32,049 --> 01:50:35,280
Because of certain conditions,
I was grinding.

1504
01:50:35,353 --> 01:50:40,518
There's one test that they recommended
I take, it's about $5,000 to $ 7,000.

1505
01:50:40,591 --> 01:50:46,052
The dentist that I talked to,
it's like $15,000 or more.

1506
01:50:46,130 --> 01:50:51,193
It's two years I have no medical coverage,
so I can't go for the last part of the test.

1507
01:50:53,471 --> 01:50:56,372
It's OK, everything's gonna be OK.
Right?

1508
01:50:56,440 --> 01:50:59,000
Yes. I am so...

1509
01:50:59,076 --> 01:51:04,275
It's so hard for me to digest
somebody saying it's free.

1510
01:51:05,416 --> 01:51:10,353
Because 20 years of our lives
have been spent fighting.

1511
01:51:10,421 --> 01:51:13,481
So I am so grateful.

1512
01:51:15,359 --> 01:51:17,850
No, you don't need to say that.

1513
01:51:18,896 --> 01:51:21,262
- Thank you. Thank you.
- OK.

1514
01:51:21,332 --> 01:51:23,857
Come on, don't cry.
Everything's gonna be OK, right?

1515
01:51:23,934 --> 01:51:27,529
- Thank you.
- At least what we can do, right?

1516
01:52:48,853 --> 01:52:53,586
<i>Reggie was diagnosed with
pulmonary and bronchial problems.</i>

1517
01:52:53,657 --> 01:52:58,287
<i>The Cuban doctors gave her
a treatment plan to follow back home.</i>

1518
01:52:58,362 --> 01:53:01,798
<i>Along with some of those
five cent inhalers.</i>

1519
01:53:02,633 --> 01:53:06,467
<i>William Maher received a number
of treatments on his neck and his back.</i>

1520
01:53:06,537 --> 01:53:11,873
<i>Having ground down his teeth for
three years due to post-traumatic stress.</i>

1521
01:53:11,942 --> 01:53:14,843
<i>He left Cuba with a new set of teeth.</i>

1522
01:53:16,881 --> 01:53:20,942
<i>After a series of tests
on his heart. Lungs. Blood and stomach.</i>

1523
01:53:21,018 --> 01:53:23,680
<i>John now knew
what his ailments were.</i>

1524
01:53:23,754 --> 01:53:27,952
<i>He was given a strict plan to follow.
Plus a number of treatments</i>

1525
01:53:28,025 --> 01:53:31,392
<i>and was feeling better
than he had in years.</i>

1526
01:53:31,462 --> 01:53:36,525
<i>The Cuban doctors were able to take
Donna off five of her nine medications.</i>

1527
01:53:36,600 --> 01:53:40,536
<i>And with a correct diagnosis.
Gave her a treatment plan</i>

1528
01:53:40,604 --> 01:53:43,505
<i>to help her live a more normal life.</i>

1529
01:53:48,946 --> 01:53:51,210
<i>When firefighters
and paramedics in Havana</i>

1530
01:53:51,282 --> 01:53:53,944
<i>heard that the 911 rescue workers
were in town.</i>

1531
01:53:54,018 --> 01:53:57,283
<i>They invited them over
to one of their firehouses.</i>

1532
01:53:57,354 --> 01:53:59,618
<i>And so. On our last day there.</i>

1533
01:53:59,690 --> 01:54:02,386
<i>As we arrived. They stood at attention</i>

1534
01:54:02,459 --> 01:54:07,556
<i>because. They said.
They wanted to honor the heroes of 911.</i>

1535
01:54:45,636 --> 01:54:50,699
<i>S. Somos familia. Y los hermanos
que perdimos en las Torres Gemelas</i>

1536
01:54:50,774 --> 01:54:53,402
<i>se sinti en el mundo completo.</i>

1537
01:54:54,578 --> 01:54:59,242
The brothers we lost on 9/11
was felt around the world.

1538
01:54:59,316 --> 01:55:01,910
<i>- Mis hermanos.
- Mis hermanos.</i>

1539
01:55:04,955 --> 01:55:07,651
Don't hesitate to hug a brother.

1540
01:55:12,596 --> 01:55:16,589
It's very important for them to wear
the SCBA so they don't end up like me.

1541
01:55:16,667 --> 01:55:19,101
- They're lungs.
- These tanks.

1542
01:55:19,169 --> 01:55:21,660
SCBA. Self-Contained
Breathing Apparatus.

1543
01:55:21,739 --> 01:55:24,867
<i>Tenemos una reserva tambin en el carro.</i>

1544
01:55:24,942 --> 01:55:27,069
<i>Es un placer poder venir aqu.</i>

1545
01:55:27,144 --> 01:55:29,874
<i>Esto es lo nico
que tenemos nosotros...</i>

1546
01:55:32,082 --> 01:55:34,414
F- F-F.

1547
01:55:34,485 --> 01:55:35,645
Three Fs.

1548
01:55:44,995 --> 01:55:48,692
<i>If this is what can happen
beteen supposed enemies.</i>

1549
01:55:48,766 --> 01:55:52,668
<i>If one enemy can hold out his hand
and offer to heal.</i>

1550
01:55:52,736 --> 01:55:54,897
<i>Then what else is possible?</i>

1551
01:55:58,876 --> 01:56:01,436
<i>That's when I heard
that the man who runs the biggest</i>

1552
01:56:01,512 --> 01:56:04,276
<i>anti-Michael Moore website
on the internet</i>

1553
01:56:04,348 --> 01:56:07,181
<i>was going to have to shut it down.</i>

1554
01:56:07,251 --> 01:56:11,813
<i>He could no longer afford to keep it up
because his wife was ill</i>

1555
01:56:11,889 --> 01:56:16,155
<i>and they couldn't afford to pay
for her health insurance.</i>

1556
01:56:16,226 --> 01:56:22,222
<i>He was faced with a choice of either keep
attacking me or pay for his wife's health.</i>

1557
01:56:23,233 --> 01:56:26,134
<i>Fortunately. He chose his wife.</i>

1558
01:56:27,171 --> 01:56:31,471
<i>But something seemed wrong
about being forced into such a decision.</i>

1559
01:56:31,542 --> 01:56:35,842
<i>Why. In a free country. Shouldn't he
be able to have health insurance</i>

1560
01:56:35,913 --> 01:56:41,374
<i>and exercise his First Amendment right
to run me into the ground?</i>

1561
01:56:42,152 --> 01:56:46,589
<i>So I wrote a check for the $ 12.000
he needed to keep his wife insured</i>

1562
01:56:46,657 --> 01:56:50,787
<i>and in treatment.
And sent it to him anonymously.</i>

1563
01:56:53,063 --> 01:56:58,365
<i>His wife got better
and his website is still going strong.</i>

1564
01:57:04,208 --> 01:57:07,905
<i>It was hard for me to acknowledge
that in the end.</i>

1565
01:57:07,978 --> 01:57:10,242
<i>We truly are all in the same boat.</i>

1566
01:57:10,981 --> 01:57:13,677
<i>And that. No matter what our differences.</i>

1567
01:57:13,751 --> 01:57:16,777
<i>We sink or swim together.</i>

1568
01:57:16,854 --> 01:57:20,381
<i>That's how it seems to be
everywhere else.</i>

1569
01:57:20,958 --> 01:57:25,258
<i>They take care of each other.
No matter what their disagreements.</i>

1570
01:57:26,764 --> 01:57:32,361
<i>You know. When we see a good idea
from another country. We grab it.</i>

1571
01:57:32,436 --> 01:57:36,133
<i>If they build a better car. We drive it.</i>

1572
01:57:36,206 --> 01:57:39,539
<i>If they make a better wine. We drink it.</i>

1573
01:57:40,677 --> 01:57:43,908
<i>So if they've come up with
a better way to treat the sick.</i>

1574
01:57:43,981 --> 01:57:45,972
<i>To teach their kids.</i>

1575
01:57:47,050 --> 01:57:49,541
<i>To take care of their babies.</i>

1576
01:57:50,554 --> 01:57:53,455
<i>To simply be good to each other.</i>

1577
01:57:53,524 --> 01:57:56,152
<i>Then what's our problem?</i>

1578
01:57:56,226 --> 01:57:58,558
<i>Why can't we do that?</i>

1579
01:57:58,629 --> 01:58:02,087
<i>They live in a world of "we. "
Not "me. "</i>

1580
01:58:03,167 --> 01:58:08,104
<i>We'll never fix anything
until we get that one basic thing right.</i>

1581
01:58:08,172 --> 01:58:11,300
<i>And powerful forces
hope that we never do.</i>

1582
01:58:11,975 --> 01:58:15,706
<i>And that we remain the only country
in the western world</i>

1583
01:58:15,779 --> 01:58:18,771
<i>without free universal healthcare.</i>

1584
01:58:19,550 --> 01:58:23,543
<i>You know. If we ever did remove
the chokehold of medical bills.</i>

1585
01:58:24,154 --> 01:58:27,123
<i>College loans. Day care.</i>

1586
01:58:27,191 --> 01:58:31,355
<i>And everything else
that makes us afraid to step out of line.</i>

1587
01:58:31,428 --> 01:58:34,124
<i>Well. Watch out.</i>

1588
01:58:34,198 --> 01:58:37,725
<i>'Cause it'll be a new day in America.</i>

1589
01:58:37,801 --> 01:58:39,792
<i>In the meantime.</i>

1590
01:58:39,870 --> 01:58:43,806
<i>I'm gonna go get the government
to do my laundry.</i>

1591
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:47,097
