1
00:01:09,827 --> 00:01:13,831
You've come to cut off my head!

2
00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:17,043
Cut off your head, my lord?!

3
00:01:17,043 --> 00:01:18,795
We are merely

4
00:01:18,795 --> 00:01:20,588
bringing you your medicine.

5
00:01:20,588 --> 00:01:22,089
Out of my way!

6
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:26,344
I am certain I heard someone say it.

7
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:36,604
My lord, we have added twice as many bodyguards to your quarters, just like you instructed.

8
00:01:37,104 --> 00:01:40,358
Nobody would dare lay a hand on you!

9
00:01:40,358 --> 00:01:43,611
You are the most powerful man in this country.

10
00:01:49,116 --> 00:01:51,369
Power...

11
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:57,375
All useless, all useless. I have nothing.

12
00:01:57,375 --> 00:02:01,629
My wife is dead, and so are all my daughters.

13
00:02:01,629 --> 00:02:06,884
There is nothing left for me now.

14
00:02:08,385 --> 00:02:11,889
But still, my lord. His Majesty himself has ordered this medicine for you, 

15
00:02:11,889 --> 00:02:15,560
and gifted you with that chair and that cane.

16
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:19,313
That's why I must be even more on guard.

17
00:02:19,313 --> 00:02:24,068
What if I do take this medicine? What use would that be if my head is cut off?

18
00:02:24,068 --> 00:02:25,820
What are you talking about, my lord?

19
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:28,573
Why would you say something so terrible?

20
00:02:29,824 --> 00:02:33,202
I was told I would not die a peaceful death,

21
00:02:33,452 --> 00:02:35,496
that I was fated to have my head cut off.

22
00:02:35,496 --> 00:02:39,500
But who would dare say something so outrageous?

23
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,252
There was one man.

24
00:02:43,754 --> 00:02:45,840
He was a physiognomist.

25
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:50,136
You mean he could tell the future from people's faces? Isn't that just superstition?

26
00:02:50,386 --> 00:02:53,431
You say this because you have never met him yourself.

27
00:02:53,431 --> 00:02:57,685
He... There was nothing that he didn't know.

28
00:02:58,728 --> 00:03:01,230
He would take just one look at someone's face

29
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:06,485
and he would know everything about them.

30
00:03:06,736 --> 00:03:08,738
He was...

31
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:15,036
He was the best face reader in all of Joseon.

32
00:03:30,718 --> 00:03:34,722
Are you sure people actually live in this godforsaken countryside?

33
00:03:34,972 --> 00:03:38,726
They definitely told me he was around here somewhere!

34
00:03:48,486 --> 00:03:50,738
I can't walk any more! I give up!

35
00:04:16,763 --> 00:04:19,517
We- we- we've arrived, ma'am!

36
00:04:25,523 --> 00:04:27,024
So heavy...

37
00:04:27,525 --> 00:04:29,276
The air is so fresh here!

38
00:04:31,028 --> 00:04:32,780
Beautiful scenery, too.

39
00:04:33,531 --> 00:04:34,281
Sorry, who are you?

40
00:04:34,281 --> 00:04:37,034
We've come because of the rumors.

41
00:04:37,034 --> 00:04:40,538
We're looking for the famous face reader-

42
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,041
What are you doing?!

43
00:04:46,794 --> 00:04:49,547
Oh, hey, didn't I tell you?

44
00:04:50,297 --> 00:04:53,300
That there are, uh, people coming to look at our writing brushes.

45
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,803
Did you say you were looking for the ones made out of weasel fur?

46
00:04:57,304 --> 00:05:00,808
Well, ah, er, yes, we have...

47
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,812
I'm going to the market place, uncle.

48
00:05:04,812 --> 00:05:06,063
Okay, okay.

49
00:05:06,564 --> 00:05:09,567
Take care, don't be in a hurry, there's no need to rush.

50
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:16,073
I'm terribly sorry, it's just that my nephew hates it when anyone mentions face reading.

51
00:05:16,073 --> 00:05:18,325
Thank you for understanding. Now, this way, if you will, please.

52
00:05:18,325 --> 00:05:20,327
Let's go, ma'am. This way.

53
00:05:28,085 --> 00:05:31,338
These are our weasel pelts, ma'am, they're very high-quality.

54
00:05:31,338 --> 00:05:33,090
Not interested in buying any of these, I see?

55
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:34,592
Hyung!

56
00:05:34,592 --> 00:05:37,344
Oh, great, he's gone and taken off his shirt again.

57
00:05:37,344 --> 00:05:40,598
Hyung, get up. Get up!

58
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:43,350
Hyung! Hyung! Wake up.

59
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:47,354
-The green rice cakes...
-Yes, they're delicious, aren't they, come on, rise and shine.

60
00:05:47,354 --> 00:05:49,356
He's just talking in his sleep, no need to worry.

61
00:05:49,356 --> 00:05:52,109
Now, my brother-in-law might not look like it, I know,

62
00:05:52,109 --> 00:05:55,112
but not a single one of the couples he's matched has had troubles. He's an expert.

63
00:05:55,112 --> 00:05:57,865
Hyung, wake up, we have visitors.

64
00:05:58,115 --> 00:06:00,618
We have guests.

65
00:06:01,118 --> 00:06:02,870
Ugh, I've had way too much to drink.

66
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:07,124
These guests say they're importing silk from China, 

67
00:06:07,124 --> 00:06:10,878
and they want to know if their business will do well.

68
00:06:15,883 --> 00:06:17,134
Go home.

69
00:06:18,886 --> 00:06:19,887
What?

70
00:06:20,888 --> 00:06:24,641
If you're going to lie to me, you'd better go home.

71
00:06:32,149 --> 00:06:33,901
You, sir, in the hat.

72
00:06:33,901 --> 00:06:36,153
I can see in your eyes that you're having money problems

73
00:06:36,153 --> 00:06:41,158
and your dark eyebrows and small round eyes tell me you have absolutely no interest in trading.

74
00:06:41,408 --> 00:06:45,913
You like looking after people, you'd be much happier as a palace eunuch or servant.

75
00:06:45,913 --> 00:06:48,665
Sure, the madam is interested in business and she's good at it, too,

76
00:06:48,665 --> 00:06:52,169
but she doesn't look like someone who'd stop at buying and selling fabrics.

77
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:54,671
You look a bit like a shaman, judging by your complexion and red lips,

78
00:06:54,671 --> 00:06:59,426
but your fate isn't to become a shaman at all.

79
00:06:59,426 --> 00:07:03,180
And you say you're going to do business with the Chinese?

80
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:07,684
I don't know what your intentions are but if you're going to lie I suggest you leave now.

81
00:07:09,436 --> 00:07:10,938
Huh, really?

82
00:07:10,938 --> 00:07:14,942
What on earth...

83
00:07:14,942 --> 00:07:17,194
Where are you really from?

84
00:07:17,945 --> 00:07:19,446
Why are you laughing?

85
00:07:19,446 --> 00:07:22,199
You'd have better luck trying to lie to the God of the Underworld!

86
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:25,452
How on earth did you expect to get away with showing my brother-in-law your faces

87
00:07:25,452 --> 00:07:27,454
and trying to lie to him?

88
00:07:27,955 --> 00:07:29,456
I'm impressed.

89
00:07:29,706 --> 00:07:32,209
I think it's been worth the journey, don't you think?

90
00:07:40,217 --> 00:07:44,221
Have you ever heard of the brothel Yeonhong?

91
00:07:44,221 --> 00:07:48,433
Why of course I have, hasn't everyone?

92
00:07:49,184 --> 00:07:51,687
Isn't it famous for being the brothel that tells people their fortunes?

93
00:07:52,437 --> 00:07:55,190
The one that even noble government officials will go to.

94
00:07:55,691 --> 00:07:58,694
You're looking at the woman who owns it, sir.

95
00:08:01,446 --> 00:08:05,951
You? A physiognomist? You don't have the eyes of a fortune teller!

96
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:08,954
I don't do it myself.

97
00:08:09,454 --> 00:08:12,457
But I've been through a lot ever since I was young,

98
00:08:13,208 --> 00:08:15,210
so I do have pretty good intuition.

99
00:08:17,963 --> 00:08:20,465
I - why, I, what, why - what are you -

100
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:27,806
How would you feel about working for us?

101
00:08:28,056 --> 00:08:34,855
Your skills are incredible, don't you think they're wasted in a place like this?

102
00:08:37,107 --> 00:08:40,110
I, I'm not sure if my brother-in-law is who you want to be talking to.

103
00:08:40,861 --> 00:08:44,364
He only reads people's faces.

104
00:08:45,616 --> 00:08:47,868
Well, I've heard my fortune, so I suppose I should pay.

105
00:08:54,374 --> 00:08:56,376
You should earn money while you can.

106
00:08:56,376 --> 00:09:00,130
Next thing you know, you'll find your life over in the blink of an eye.

107
00:09:02,633 --> 00:09:04,635
How long are you going to live like this, hm?

108
00:09:05,427 --> 00:09:07,429
Weasel fur, my ass...

109
00:09:09,431 --> 00:09:11,433
Ow, ow, ow, my back.

110
00:09:11,433 --> 00:09:13,935
What did you think, ma'am? Think he'll be useful to you?

111
00:09:13,935 --> 00:09:17,689
Oh, he won't stop at being useful to me. He'll cause a wave of excitement throughout all of Hanyang.

112
00:09:35,457 --> 00:09:36,792
This is made of rat whiskers, isn't it?

113
00:09:39,795 --> 00:09:41,296
Can't you pay me a little more?

114
00:09:41,296 --> 00:09:43,298
I know how hard it is to find something like this.

115
00:09:43,298 --> 00:09:44,800
Wait here a moment.

116
00:09:49,054 --> 00:09:50,555
Please, my lord, just a little more time...

117
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:53,058
Drag this man out!

118
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:57,562
Since your husband hasn't paid the taxes for this month, I'll settle for taking you instead.

119
00:09:57,562 --> 00:09:59,064
No, my lord!

120
00:10:00,315 --> 00:10:01,817
Please don't do this!

121
00:10:03,318 --> 00:10:04,820
I am a married woman, my lord.

122
00:10:04,820 --> 00:10:06,571
- Please don't do this...
- Shut up and stop moving.

123
00:10:06,822 --> 00:10:08,073
No, please - ahh!

124
00:10:11,326 --> 00:10:13,328
That bastard...

125
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:16,832
Are you out of your mind?!

126
00:10:16,832 --> 00:10:18,333
- He's an inspector from the government!
- Get out of my way!

127
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,085
I'm telling you, you musn't!

128
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:22,087
So I'm supposed to stay put and let it happen?

129
00:10:22,337 --> 00:10:26,842
Please! If you try to interrupt, you'll just get us all killed.

130
00:10:27,092 --> 00:10:30,095
Please let it go, just this once, for our sake!

131
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:37,853
Wow, it smells amazing.

132
00:10:38,353 --> 00:10:40,355
You have to flip it now -

133
00:10:40,355 --> 00:10:42,607
No, go away, go away!

134
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:47,609
You've never even had meat, have you? You don't know anything about it.

135
00:10:48,864 --> 00:10:50,115
Jinhyung!

136
00:10:50,115 --> 00:10:53,618
Hey, Jinhyung! You haven't had dinner yet, have you?

137
00:10:54,619 --> 00:10:55,871
Hey, you brat.

138
00:10:55,871 --> 00:10:58,373
We're eating chicken for dinner today, you brat.

139
00:10:58,874 --> 00:11:03,128
Look, we're boiling the meat right now! We're going to have a feast...

140
00:11:08,133 --> 00:11:09,134
What's happened to him?

141
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:16,892
Eat up.

142
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:29,404
Where did you get the money to buy this?

143
00:11:35,911 --> 00:11:37,913
Oh, you remember the people who were here earlier?

144
00:11:37,913 --> 00:11:41,416
We bought it with the money they paid for the brushes.

145
00:11:43,168 --> 00:11:44,920
All the brushes were still there, uncle.

146
00:11:50,175 --> 00:11:51,176
Have you started fortune-telling again?

147
00:11:51,176 --> 00:11:54,179
What? Of course not, what do you mean?

148
00:11:57,682 --> 00:12:00,685
Alright, I admit it. They begged me, so I didn't have a choice.

149
00:12:00,685 --> 00:12:02,437
Why? What's your problem?

150
00:12:02,437 --> 00:12:04,189
Didn't you promise me you'd never start doing it again?

151
00:12:04,189 --> 00:12:07,192
How could you do such a thing as a scholar?

152
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:12,197
Then what am I supposed to do? Study for the entrance exam? Enter the government?

153
00:12:13,948 --> 00:12:15,450
Couldn't you?

154
00:12:15,450 --> 00:12:17,452
What, are you seriously asking?

155
00:12:18,953 --> 00:12:22,957
Who would allow the descendant of a traitor to take up a public office, hmm?

156
00:12:26,961 --> 00:12:29,714
You've been studying, haven't you? I've seen the books in your room.

157
00:12:29,714 --> 00:12:32,217
Even if you go take the exam, don't ever think about going into politics.

158
00:12:32,217 --> 00:12:35,720
You have the face of your grandfather; something horrible will happen to you if you ever enter the world of politics.

159
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,973
No. I will enter the government.

160
00:12:39,224 --> 00:12:41,476
I can't live like this forever.

161
00:12:41,476 --> 00:12:44,979
Even if I end up getting my head cut off like my grandfather, I refuse to live like this.

162
00:12:49,984 --> 00:12:51,486
How dare you say that?

163
00:12:58,243 --> 00:13:00,745
Put that drink down, you brat!

164
00:13:03,998 --> 00:13:08,253
I'm not a child any more. I'm already past seventeen!

165
00:13:08,753 --> 00:13:11,256
Hey, Jinhyung, don't go... Finish your food first...

166
00:13:12,507 --> 00:13:16,511
You know he drinks with me every now and then.

167
00:13:17,262 --> 00:13:18,763
What a frustrating -

168
00:13:21,516 --> 00:13:24,269
What possessed you to say something like that to him?

169
00:13:26,521 --> 00:13:30,108
Otherwise he would never be able to let go of that hope.

170
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:31,860
Well, I'll be damned...

171
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:36,000
Remember when you were immature and chasing around merchants all the time?

172
00:13:37,407 --> 00:13:42,078
I spent days drinking myself into a stupor.

173
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:45,081
And when I tried to commit suicide by hanging myself,

174
00:13:45,331 --> 00:13:47,834
why, I saw that boy looking right at me and crying his heart out.

175
00:13:48,835 --> 00:13:51,045
He was maybe about 5 years old.

176
00:13:51,045 --> 00:13:54,549
There was nothing left of the kid but skin and bones, and I guess he was hungry

177
00:13:55,508 --> 00:13:58,344
because he was crying "Father, father, save me."

178
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:04,142
I cut the rope, started begging for food and was barely able to save him.

179
00:14:06,394 --> 00:14:10,940
I don't know if it was because he couldn't eat properly, but he started limping.

180
00:14:12,192 --> 00:14:15,945
He takes after me so he's smart and an amazing writer,

181
00:14:15,945 --> 00:14:21,200
but he was born the descendant of a traitor and on top of it all he has a limp, how frustrated would he be?

182
00:14:22,702 --> 00:14:26,497
I don't know why my sister ever married into a household like this.

183
00:14:26,497 --> 00:14:30,251
You brat, do you know how many houses my family had in Hanyang back then?

184
00:14:30,251 --> 00:14:33,504
Women flocked to the gates just to take a look at my -

185
00:14:33,504 --> 00:14:36,507
I know, I know. All you do is talk of the past.

186
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:45,516
I've decided to go to that place called Yeonhong.

187
00:14:47,310 --> 00:14:48,311
What?

188
00:14:49,062 --> 00:14:51,564
We can't live our entire lives like this, can we?

189
00:14:51,814 --> 00:14:56,569
I studied physiognomy tooth and nail to feed myself

190
00:14:56,569 --> 00:14:59,572
but all that's useless here in the countryside.

191
00:14:59,822 --> 00:15:03,326
I could earn a fortune by reading faces in Hanyang, couldn't I?

192
00:15:03,826 --> 00:15:06,871
I can use physiognomy to save this household from poverty.

193
00:15:07,372 --> 00:15:09,374
We'll be able to eat rice and beef stew three times a day,

194
00:15:09,374 --> 00:15:13,878
get the boy some good clothes to wear so he'll never have to live in shame again.

195
00:15:13,878 --> 00:15:18,299
If we're going to Hanyang, what are we going to tell Jinhyung?

196
00:15:20,343 --> 00:15:22,428
Tomorrow, before he gets out of bed,

197
00:15:23,262 --> 00:15:26,057
we must leave a false message saying that we're leaving for trade.

198
00:15:26,057 --> 00:15:30,000
Afterwards, you can come by to see him every now and then.

199
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:36,109
So you must wake me up first thing tomorrow morning and we'll leave for Hanyang, alright?

200
00:16:03,511 --> 00:16:04,512
Hyung!

201
00:16:06,514 --> 00:16:07,765
Hyung!

202
00:16:09,517 --> 00:16:13,271
Jinhyung! Jinhyung!

203
00:16:21,028 --> 00:16:23,781
Didn't I tell you last night that we were drinking too much?

204
00:16:25,283 --> 00:16:26,284
Jinhyung.

205
00:16:29,036 --> 00:16:32,039
"I am leaving to find a peaceful temple to study in."

206
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:35,293
- Jinhyung!
- "I promise I will get a position in the government"?

207
00:16:35,293 --> 00:16:38,296
"Once I do, I will be able to support you, Father and Uncle,"

208
00:16:38,296 --> 00:16:41,299
- Jinhyung!
- "so please take care of yourselves until we meet again."

209
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:44,302
"I apologize for disobeying you. Jinhyung."

210
00:16:54,061 --> 00:16:56,314
That - that bastard -

211
00:16:56,564 --> 00:16:57,315
Stop, stop, don't.

212
00:16:57,315 --> 00:16:59,317
Just let him.

213
00:16:59,817 --> 00:17:02,069
Just let him go.

214
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,072
We're going to leave ourselves, aren't we?

215
00:17:06,324 --> 00:17:08,075
Jinhyung!

216
00:17:44,695 --> 00:17:51,452
See how good he is at calligraphy? It's a good thing he takes after his grandfather, not his father.

217
00:17:53,704 --> 00:17:56,207
Look at him limping.

218
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:59,210
My son...

219
00:18:03,214 --> 00:18:05,007
Stay in good health, my son.

220
00:18:08,511 --> 00:18:10,000
Huh? Let's go see what's happening.

221
00:18:12,515 --> 00:18:15,017
Hyung, don't you think they're looking at us?

222
00:18:15,768 --> 00:18:19,772
It's surely because I'm much more handsome, now that I've trimmed my beard.

223
00:18:20,022 --> 00:18:21,273
And dressed for the occasion, too.

224
00:18:21,273 --> 00:18:23,025
No, I think they're looking at me.

225
00:18:25,528 --> 00:18:29,281
He only knows how to read faces, doesn't he?
Doesn't know a thing about the world.

226
00:18:30,032 --> 00:18:32,785
Rest assured, I know how to handle country bumpkins like them.

227
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:39,792
Why don't you go and set the table for dinner?

228
00:18:40,292 --> 00:18:41,794
Yes, ma'am!

229
00:18:44,547 --> 00:18:46,799
Hanyang is amazing, isn't it?

230
00:18:48,050 --> 00:18:49,301
Look at that meat.

231
00:18:56,308 --> 00:18:58,310
Oh, er, we...

232
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:02,815
- We just took a few bites...
- We've just been sampling the food.

233
00:19:03,566 --> 00:19:04,400
Come in, girls!

234
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,027
Yes, ma'am.

235
00:19:08,279 --> 00:19:10,281
What - What are you doing?

236
00:19:10,281 --> 00:19:11,031
Why are you -

237
00:19:11,031 --> 00:19:13,284
Take your hands off me -

238
00:19:13,784 --> 00:19:16,287
What is the meaning of this?

239
00:19:25,796 --> 00:19:30,301
This is the best physiognomist in all of Hanyang, so take extra good care of him.

240
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:48,152
Please take a seat.

241
00:19:48,903 --> 00:19:50,905
Why don't you pour me a glass?

242
00:19:53,657 --> 00:19:55,409
What can you tell from looking at my face?

243
00:19:55,910 --> 00:20:00,164
He's the one who reads people's faces! I read people's hearts.

244
00:20:00,164 --> 00:20:01,916
People's hearts?

245
00:20:03,167 --> 00:20:04,668
Let's have a look.

246
00:20:06,670 --> 00:20:10,174
What do you think about my face? Men tell me they don't like me all the time.

247
00:20:13,677 --> 00:20:14,929
Here you go.

248
00:20:14,929 --> 00:20:16,430
What's that?

249
00:20:17,431 --> 00:20:19,934
You have a face that's round and pretty but not particularly memorable compared to others,

250
00:20:19,934 --> 00:20:24,188
but if you stand out, they'll start following you like lost puppies.

251
00:20:24,188 --> 00:20:26,941
Is that so? Thank you!

252
00:20:28,943 --> 00:20:31,695
If I may, there's something I want to ask.

253
00:20:31,946 --> 00:20:34,698
You must have heard that there are two men fighting over the throne of Joseon?

254
00:20:34,698 --> 00:20:37,201
One from the Yi family, and one from the Kim family.

255
00:20:37,201 --> 00:20:40,704
Every day fights between the two families break out in the streets and innocent people die.

256
00:20:40,704 --> 00:20:43,207
It's a scary world we live in.

257
00:20:43,457 --> 00:20:46,710
So, which side do you think will come out on top?

258
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,713
I also have heard of the rumors that are going around.

259
00:20:49,713 --> 00:20:51,966
Grand Prince Suyang and Kim Jongseo, was it?

260
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:53,217
You're right!

261
00:20:53,968 --> 00:20:55,469
You're forgetting that I have not yet had the honor

262
00:20:55,469 --> 00:20:59,723
of gazing upon the visages of such great and important men, so I don't know their faces.

263
00:20:59,723 --> 00:21:04,478
I have heard the people say that Grand Prince Suyang's face is like that of a wolf

264
00:21:04,728 --> 00:21:08,232
and Kim Jongseo's is reminiscent of a tiger...?

265
00:21:08,232 --> 00:21:12,236
A wolf and a tiger? Wait just one moment...

266
00:21:13,737 --> 00:21:14,989
Right.

267
00:21:23,497 --> 00:21:27,501
How on earth am I supposed to know? The stronger one will win, of course.

268
00:21:30,004 --> 00:21:32,756
Sign this contract for me, will you?

269
00:21:33,007 --> 00:21:34,758
Sign what contract?

270
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:37,761
I'll have to take a look at it first -

271
00:21:37,761 --> 00:21:41,015
Oh, where's the fun in that? Don't you want to have fun with us first?

272
00:21:41,015 --> 00:21:42,516
Hyung, we don't have time for that!

273
00:21:42,516 --> 00:21:45,019
I've promised to read the people's hearts -

274
00:21:45,019 --> 00:21:46,520


275
00:21:49,273 --> 00:21:53,027
I see someone had a good time last night.

276
00:21:53,277 --> 00:21:55,779
Hey. Wake up.

277
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:57,281
Wake up!

278
00:22:02,536 --> 00:22:03,537
Who're you?

279
00:22:03,537 --> 00:22:07,541
What do you mean, who are you? You must still be drunk!

280
00:22:07,791 --> 00:22:09,668
You have visitors.

281
00:22:09,668 --> 00:22:10,669
What visitors?

282
00:22:10,669 --> 00:22:12,963
Don't you remember the contract you signed?

283
00:22:14,465 --> 00:22:16,216
Good lord, do you know how much you've had?

284
00:22:16,216 --> 00:22:20,721
"...must perform face readings from dusk to dawn..."

285
00:22:20,721 --> 00:22:21,722
"...will not get any days off for two years..."

286
00:22:21,722 --> 00:22:24,725
And just how many gisaengs did you call in, hmm?

287
00:22:24,725 --> 00:22:27,478
What on earth is this about?

288
00:22:28,729 --> 00:22:30,731
Haha, hyung, wait a moment, let me handle this.

289
00:22:31,231 --> 00:22:32,983
Oh, you don't think - 

290
00:22:32,983 --> 00:22:37,988
I heard that in Hanyang they'll cut your balls off while your eyes are closed!

291
00:22:38,238 --> 00:22:41,492
You - hey, you bastards - how dare you - 

292
00:22:41,492 --> 00:22:44,495
You -

293
00:22:44,495 --> 00:22:46,246
Hey, you bald bastard - 

294
00:22:46,246 --> 00:22:47,498
Let go of me!

295
00:22:47,498 --> 00:22:49,249
You little rat...

296
00:22:49,249 --> 00:22:51,502
Let - ow! Let go, it hurts, it hurts.

297
00:22:53,253 --> 00:22:54,505
Ow, that hurts.

298
00:23:04,014 --> 00:23:07,017
You there, stand in line!

299
00:23:07,017 --> 00:23:09,520
Are you just going to let people come forever?

300
00:23:11,271 --> 00:23:14,525
All we have to do is sit back and watch the money roll in!

301
00:23:14,525 --> 00:23:17,027
We're killing two birds with one stone, ma'am!

302
00:23:17,027 --> 00:23:19,279
They say face reading is better than fortune telling, 

303
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:22,533
but won't you agree that intuition is a hundred times better than face reading?

304
00:23:26,286 --> 00:23:30,290
You'd better hurry up, you still have twenty more bundles to go!

305
00:23:34,044 --> 00:23:36,046
Couldn't catch a breath the entire day.

306
00:23:39,550 --> 00:23:42,803
How on earth did we get into this mess?

307
00:23:43,554 --> 00:23:45,556
I told you we should probably stop drinking!

308
00:23:45,556 --> 00:23:49,560
What? Weren't you the one who wouldn't shut up about reading hearts?

309
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:52,563
Hey! Get the hell away from me, you beast!

310
00:23:53,564 --> 00:23:56,567
I can't even... why do I...

311
00:23:58,068 --> 00:24:00,320
You son of a bitch!

312
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,822
Stop right there!

313
00:24:06,076 --> 00:24:08,829
Your temper hasn't improved a bit from back when you were chasing merchants all over the place!

314
00:24:09,329 --> 00:24:11,832
What, then? I should stand back and let ourselves be used like this?

315
00:24:11,832 --> 00:24:14,334
So what were you planning to do, go kick up a fuss with that stick?

316
00:24:14,334 --> 00:24:16,336
Will that make the contract magically disappear, then?

317
00:24:16,336 --> 00:24:18,839
Do you want to get beaten up?

318
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,843
Haven't I told you before?

319
00:24:24,094 --> 00:24:28,098
The way your Adam's apple sticks out, if you don't control your temper it'll ruin your life one day.

320
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:32,894
You can't accomplish anything just by flying into a rage about it.

321
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,027
Where are you going now?

322
00:24:44,531 --> 00:24:50,537
I've been observing this place for a few days, and there's something suspicious about the people who come and go.

323
00:24:50,537 --> 00:24:53,540
I'm certain this is where they read the faces of rich noblemen.

324
00:24:55,042 --> 00:24:57,794
All you have to do is get close to important people

325
00:24:57,794 --> 00:25:00,047
and money and fame will follow naturally.

326
00:25:11,308 --> 00:25:12,559
Nice place they've got here.

327
00:25:18,565 --> 00:25:20,567
Come in, come in.

328
00:25:20,817 --> 00:25:23,070
Why don't you two wait here for a moment?

329
00:25:36,083 --> 00:25:37,084
I was right, wasn't I?

330
00:25:37,584 --> 00:25:38,585
You were.

331
00:25:45,592 --> 00:25:49,137
No, no, that won't do, your buttocks are sagging again.

332
00:25:49,137 --> 00:25:52,140
Didn't I tell you that you should always tense your muscles?

333
00:25:52,891 --> 00:25:54,392
That's much better.

334
00:25:57,395 --> 00:26:00,899
I'm worried that people will think I'm dull, because my breasts are too big.

335
00:26:03,401 --> 00:26:04,402
Stop blocking the view!

336
00:26:04,402 --> 00:26:08,698
What if I burst them like you'd burst a pig's bladder?

337
00:26:09,449 --> 00:26:10,700
Ew no! Never mind!

338
00:26:15,956 --> 00:26:17,457
Let's take a look, shall we?

339
00:26:22,212 --> 00:26:23,964
She's doing it again!

340
00:26:26,716 --> 00:26:30,000
Well, you'll have good luck with men, that's for sure.

341
00:26:30,804 --> 00:26:33,640
Ma'am, the Director General of the Ministry of Justice has come to visit you.

342
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,476
Isn't he one of Lord Kim Jongseo's men?

343
00:26:36,476 --> 00:26:40,522
Yes he is, ma'am. He's requested our help

344
00:26:40,522 --> 00:26:43,149
in finding the criminal in a murder case.

345
00:26:43,149 --> 00:26:47,153
What? Good Lord.

346
00:26:47,404 --> 00:26:50,198
How does he expect us to pick out a murderer just by looking at people's faces?

347
00:26:50,699 --> 00:26:54,000
Even if there's business involved... Goddammit.

348
00:26:57,706 --> 00:27:00,458
Director General!

349
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:06,214
I'm terribly sorry, I should be the one paying you a visit. You didn't have to come in person.

350
00:27:06,965 --> 00:27:10,468
I must apologize for asking such a big favor of you when we've only just met.

351
00:27:10,468 --> 00:27:12,220
Yes, well, this way please...

352
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:16,224
The case is related to an official in the Ministry of Justice, so I'm afraid it's rather urgent.

353
00:27:16,975 --> 00:27:20,979
I came by because I've heard such good things about this place.

354
00:27:20,979 --> 00:27:22,731
Yes, well...

355
00:27:22,731 --> 00:27:25,734
I did hear about the case but

356
00:27:25,734 --> 00:27:27,736
I'm afraid that we're rather busy ourselves,

357
00:27:27,736 --> 00:27:30,739
dealing with some urgent matters...

358
00:27:39,497 --> 00:27:40,999
Director General, sir.

359
00:27:40,999 --> 00:27:43,001
I'm sorry, but who...

360
00:27:45,253 --> 00:27:48,757
I'm her business partner, my lord. My name is Kim Naekyung.

361
00:27:50,008 --> 00:27:52,510
Excuse me, but... how were you...

362
00:27:55,513 --> 00:27:58,516
The scenery behind the blinds was spectacular.

363
00:27:58,516 --> 00:28:02,020
I hope you will consider sharing it with me next time.

364
00:28:02,270 --> 00:28:06,775
In fact, my lord, Ms. Jang has asked me to help you with your case.

365
00:28:06,775 --> 00:28:09,027
Oh, is that so?

366
00:28:09,527 --> 00:28:12,030
I see that you've been preparing beforehand.

367
00:28:21,289 --> 00:28:24,793
These three men were found at the scene of the crime and promptly arrested.

368
00:28:25,043 --> 00:28:28,046
No matter how long we tortured them, none of them would confess to the crime.

369
00:28:28,046 --> 00:28:30,548
The murderer must be one of these three men...

370
00:28:30,548 --> 00:28:33,051


371
00:28:43,812 --> 00:28:48,817
The murder happened this morning, so the body hasn't been buried yet, has it?

372
00:28:49,818 --> 00:28:51,820
I must see the corpse.

373
00:28:53,822 --> 00:28:55,323
When I saw the victim's face I could tell 

374
00:28:55,323 --> 00:28:58,493
from the width of her glabella and the height of the skull behind her ears

375
00:28:58,493 --> 00:29:01,246
that she was to live till a ripe old age without any accidents or injuries.

376
00:29:01,246 --> 00:29:03,248
Yet she came to an untimely end.

377
00:29:03,998 --> 00:29:07,252
This was not meant to happen at all.

378
00:29:09,254 --> 00:29:10,755
Are you the husband?

379
00:29:13,508 --> 00:29:15,260
Why did you murder your wife?

380
00:29:17,762 --> 00:29:18,763
Wh- what?

381
00:29:18,763 --> 00:29:23,768
From your faces, it's a miracle you two could bear with each other for so long.

382
00:29:24,269 --> 00:29:27,522
Not a single day went by without an argument, aren't I right?

383
00:29:27,772 --> 00:29:33,278
A weasel's face and a chicken's face should never marry. You two couldn't have been more incompatible if you'd tried.

384
00:29:36,030 --> 00:29:37,782
Guards!

385
00:29:38,032 --> 00:29:40,034
Bring the gentleman in for a little questioning.

386
00:29:41,035 --> 00:29:47,792
No matter how good your own lineaments are, your destiny is always subject to change based on what kind of faces you end up meeting.

387
00:29:48,293 --> 00:29:52,046
If it wasn't for your help, sir, more innocent people may have died.

388
00:29:55,049 --> 00:29:56,801
It was nothing.

389
00:29:57,302 --> 00:30:01,055
I'm just relieved that the innocent were allowed to walk free.

390
00:30:03,558 --> 00:30:05,810
We earned a lot more today than what we made during the past few days.

391
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:07,562
A hell of a lot more!

392
00:30:08,313 --> 00:30:10,315
Our first priority should be getting out of this place.

393
00:30:10,315 --> 00:30:14,000
I don't know how we'll be able to do that, though, with how cunning that woman is.

394
00:30:15,612 --> 00:30:19,324
Kim Naekyung! So you're the famous physiognomist?

395
00:30:19,824 --> 00:30:21,576
What - what are you doing?!

396
00:30:28,666 --> 00:30:31,586


397
00:30:48,478 --> 00:30:49,979
This is him?

398
00:30:52,482 --> 00:30:56,235
The man who solved a murder case just by reading faces?

399
00:30:56,235 --> 00:30:58,988
Yes, my lord. An astonishing accomplishment.

400
00:30:59,489 --> 00:31:01,240
What should we do with him?

401
00:31:24,514 --> 00:31:26,766
He may cause trouble in the future.

402
00:31:26,766 --> 00:31:28,267
Kill him.

403
00:31:36,776 --> 00:31:38,277
We must leave now, my lord.

404
00:31:42,281 --> 00:31:45,034
- Leave behind no traces.
- Yes, sir.

405
00:32:08,766 --> 00:32:10,268
Let's go.

406
00:32:16,774 --> 00:32:19,026
They dropped something in this well!

407
00:32:45,136 --> 00:32:48,431
Seriously...

408
00:33:00,818 --> 00:33:02,612
What are you doing?

409
00:33:09,118 --> 00:33:10,119
I'll explain.

410
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,371
I was having a dream just now

411
00:33:12,371 --> 00:33:14,624
and I met this huge sandstorm!

412
00:33:15,124 --> 00:33:16,375
And there's real sand in my mouth?

413
00:33:16,375 --> 00:33:19,128
It's from the muddy water in the well we were tossed into.

414
00:33:19,128 --> 00:33:21,631
I had to spit all of it out too.

415
00:33:22,632 --> 00:33:27,386
So the criminal I caught was one of Grand Prince Suyang's men?

416
00:33:27,386 --> 00:33:29,639
That's why he tried to have me killed?

417
00:33:29,639 --> 00:33:31,140
Exactly!

418
00:33:32,141 --> 00:33:34,393
If Kim Jongseo's people hadn't been keeping tabs

419
00:33:34,393 --> 00:33:37,396
on Grand Prince Suyang, we would have died in the woods for certain.

420
00:33:37,396 --> 00:33:39,649
Nobody would have known we were dead.

421
00:33:39,649 --> 00:33:42,401
That's what I heard.

422
00:33:43,653 --> 00:33:45,655
He may cause trouble in the future.

423
00:33:45,655 --> 00:33:47,448
Kill him.

424
00:33:47,448 --> 00:33:48,950
Let's go, let's go.

425
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:49,951
What?

426
00:33:49,951 --> 00:33:52,703
If this continues we'll get our heads cut off while trying to make money.

427
00:33:58,709 --> 00:33:59,960
Where are you going?

428
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:01,212
Ah! Good God!

429
00:34:01,212 --> 00:34:04,215
Oh, greetings, Director General.

430
00:34:04,215 --> 00:34:07,967
We've, ah, come to the conclusion that

431
00:34:07,967 --> 00:34:12,723
we're just fortune tellers, really. We're not prepared to get involved in government work at all.

432
00:34:12,723 --> 00:34:15,726
Yes, of course. I'm dreadfully sorry.

433
00:34:15,726 --> 00:34:19,230
Oh, no sir, there's no need. We'd best be going, then.

434
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,982
Wait. Before you leave,

435
00:34:21,982 --> 00:34:24,527
there's someone who wants to meet you.

436
00:34:24,527 --> 00:34:26,612
What about stopping by before you leave?

437
00:34:26,612 --> 00:34:28,864
Well, we'll meet him some other time.

438
00:34:28,864 --> 00:34:30,616
- We're alright, we're alright.
- I'm afraid we're a little busy now.

439
00:34:30,616 --> 00:34:31,617
This isn't a common opportunity!

440
00:34:31,617 --> 00:34:32,368
Yes, yes, of course.

441
00:34:32,368 --> 00:34:34,870
- He's a terribly busy man, you know.
- Maybe next time, then.

442
00:34:35,663 --> 00:34:37,456
How odd.

443
00:34:37,456 --> 00:34:39,458
I've never seen anyone refuse an audience

444
00:34:39,458 --> 00:34:41,460
with Lord Kim Jongseo before.

445
00:34:43,462 --> 00:34:46,966
Sir, did you just say Lord Kim Jongseo?

446
00:34:47,466 --> 00:34:52,221
Why, yes, I did. He was very curious about the man who could catch criminals with physiognomy only.

447
00:34:52,221 --> 00:34:53,721
Well, since you two seem quite busy, I must take my leave.

448
00:34:53,721 --> 00:34:56,225
Wait, wait, wait, no, no, hold on a moment.

449
00:34:56,225 --> 00:34:58,227
It's the daily life of a face reader

450
00:34:58,227 --> 00:35:00,980
to tell people their fortunes

451
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:04,984
and sometimes even get yelled at or beaten up a few times, isn't it?

452
00:35:04,984 --> 00:35:06,485
It does happen every now and then.

453
00:35:06,485 --> 00:35:08,487
Why, it happens almost every day!

454
00:35:08,487 --> 00:35:09,738
It's quite common, quite common.

455
00:35:09,738 --> 00:35:11,240
Shall we go with you, then?

456
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,492
May I ask where he is?

457
00:35:29,133 --> 00:35:34,138
So this is the man who used physiognomy to identify a murderer?

458
00:35:34,138 --> 00:35:36,891
Yes, sir. His name is Kim Naekyung.

459
00:35:44,773 --> 00:35:47,776
Courage. Tenacity.

460
00:35:47,776 --> 00:35:50,029
A man of principle.

461
00:35:50,029 --> 00:35:52,323
What the people have been saying is right.

462
00:35:52,323 --> 00:35:54,825
His is truly a great visage to behold.

463
00:35:54,825 --> 00:35:57,077
He has the face

464
00:35:57,578 --> 00:35:59,622
of a tiger.

465
00:35:59,622 --> 00:36:02,875
Why are you scrutinizing my face so?

466
00:36:03,375 --> 00:36:05,628
What is it that you see?

467
00:36:07,379 --> 00:36:09,882
Oh, yes, sir.

468
00:36:11,634 --> 00:36:13,636
It is exactly as they say.

469
00:36:13,636 --> 00:36:16,138
Your visage is excellent, my lord.

470
00:36:17,139 --> 00:36:20,434
Do they call me a tiger?

471
00:36:23,187 --> 00:36:24,188
Yes.

472
00:36:25,439 --> 00:36:28,943
You are as brave and fearless

473
00:36:28,943 --> 00:36:31,320
as the great tiger, my lord.

474
00:36:33,405 --> 00:36:36,659
It is exactly what you are!

475
00:36:40,412 --> 00:36:43,415
You've received orders to help the Ministry of Justice with hiring personnel?

476
00:36:43,415 --> 00:36:44,667
Yes, exactly!

477
00:36:44,667 --> 00:36:47,419
Hyung, does that mean you're a government official now?

478
00:36:47,419 --> 00:36:49,421
Well no, not exactly.

479
00:36:49,421 --> 00:36:52,925
I am to sit in interviews and give my opinion on the candidates.

480
00:36:52,925 --> 00:36:54,426
Don't tell anyone yet!

481
00:36:54,927 --> 00:36:56,679
You are a government official! You are!

482
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:59,682
Calm down, you fool! Don't you have any dignity?

483
00:37:03,185 --> 00:37:06,438
People in high places must always be humble and modest -

484
00:37:10,192 --> 00:37:12,695
Everyone on this side, line up that way!

485
00:37:15,197 --> 00:37:19,702
You can see the entire world in the face of just one person.

486
00:37:19,702 --> 00:37:22,705
The head signifies the sky, so it must be high and round.

487
00:37:22,705 --> 00:37:26,458
The eyes represent the sun and the moon so they must be clear and bright.

488
00:37:26,458 --> 00:37:29,211
The mouth is a sea and the philtrum is a river so they must be long and distinct.

489
00:37:29,211 --> 00:37:31,964
The nose, the cheekbones, the forehead, and the chin are the mountains

490
00:37:31,964 --> 00:37:34,717
so they must not be too high or low.

491
00:37:34,717 --> 00:37:37,720
Hair, facial or otherwise, signifies the trees and the grass

492
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:40,472
so it must be abundant and smooth.

493
00:37:40,472 --> 00:37:43,225
If you take all this into consideration when hiring people

494
00:37:43,225 --> 00:37:46,228
you will not make any big mistakes.

495
00:37:46,228 --> 00:37:48,480
Candidate Eul is from a good family 

496
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:51,483
and he's quite handsome, too, so we were thinking of hiring him.

497
00:37:52,985 --> 00:37:56,739
Haven't I told you already? Why can't you understand?

498
00:37:56,739 --> 00:37:59,658
Isn't it true that when it comes to hiring record keepers

499
00:37:59,658 --> 00:38:02,411
it's never good to have to replace them in the middle?

500
00:38:02,411 --> 00:38:05,414
But Candidate Eul likes alcohol a little too much,

501
00:38:05,414 --> 00:38:07,666
which could easily bring about illness in middle age.

502
00:38:07,666 --> 00:38:09,418
I can also tell that he has extreme mood swings.

503
00:38:09,418 --> 00:38:12,921
He's the kind of person who will never be satisfied unless he keeps changing jobs.

504
00:38:14,173 --> 00:38:16,675
Are you the cousin of Candidate Eul?

505
00:38:16,675 --> 00:38:20,012
Does he drink a lot of alcohol?

506
00:38:20,512 --> 00:38:24,016
He drinks so much, he'll probably ask to be buried

507
00:38:24,016 --> 00:38:26,018
in a liquor barrel after his death.

508
00:38:26,018 --> 00:38:30,272
If you're going to appoint him somewhere, it should probably be a place with a lot of drinkers.

509
00:38:36,778 --> 00:38:38,780
May I ask who that man is?

510
00:38:40,032 --> 00:38:41,283
Why do you ask?

511
00:38:41,283 --> 00:38:43,035
He looks like...

512
00:38:43,035 --> 00:38:44,286
What about him?

513
00:38:44,286 --> 00:38:46,538
He's rotten to the core, I can smell it.

514
00:38:52,544 --> 00:38:54,546
We've found 52 crates of rice

515
00:38:54,546 --> 00:38:56,798
and 43 crates of fine wood,

516
00:38:56,798 --> 00:38:59,551
34 lengths of fine silk

517
00:38:59,551 --> 00:39:02,054
and 40 nyang worth of gold!

518
00:39:02,054 --> 00:39:04,556
Well, he's certainly been busy.

519
00:39:04,556 --> 00:39:08,560
How could you tell he was corrupt? He looks like a kind man.

520
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:12,814
Do you think any good would come out of having the eyes of a phoenix but the lips of a fish?

521
00:39:12,814 --> 00:39:14,566
It's not a very good face at all.

522
00:39:14,566 --> 00:39:17,569
If he'd been left alone, he would have robbed the government clean!

523
00:39:19,821 --> 00:39:22,324
Wait a minute, isn't that...

524
00:39:22,324 --> 00:39:25,077
the girl who was worried men didn't like her?

525
00:39:25,077 --> 00:39:26,328
Oh, haven't you heard?

526
00:39:26,328 --> 00:39:29,831
Ever since you put a watermelon seed on her face

527
00:39:29,831 --> 00:39:31,833
her life has gotten much better.

528
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:35,337
What, she still goes around with that watermelon seed on her face?

529
00:39:35,337 --> 00:39:37,589
No, from what I heard Jang Yeonhong made her a mole.

530
00:39:37,589 --> 00:39:41,093
They say she used pig skin or something

531
00:39:41,093 --> 00:39:43,095
to make it permanent.

532
00:39:43,095 --> 00:39:46,348
What an astonishing woman!

533
00:39:46,348 --> 00:39:48,600
She changed her destiny singlehandedly.

534
00:39:49,351 --> 00:39:51,000
Wonder if she could do that for me too.

535
00:39:51,603 --> 00:39:55,107
I'm sorry, I can't let you cut in the line even if you bring gifts.

536
00:39:55,857 --> 00:39:59,611
Anyway, he's coming soon so wait a moment - what's this?

537
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:00,862
Expensive ginseng.

538
00:40:00,862 --> 00:40:01,613
Ginseng?

539
00:40:01,613 --> 00:40:02,864
Yes.

540
00:40:02,864 --> 00:40:03,615
Ginseng!

541
00:40:03,615 --> 00:40:04,616
Yes.

542
00:40:04,616 --> 00:40:07,869
Well, I - how on earth did you get...

543
00:40:07,869 --> 00:40:10,372
Well, why don't you stand here then?

544
00:40:10,372 --> 00:40:13,125
Everyone please stand further inside!

545
00:40:13,125 --> 00:40:14,626
What's this?

546
00:40:14,626 --> 00:40:15,877
It's dried persimmon.

547
00:40:15,877 --> 00:40:17,379
Dried persimmon? Wait a moment, then.

548
00:40:17,379 --> 00:40:20,882
Anyway, please remain in line, one-by-one please.

549
00:40:21,133 --> 00:40:23,135
Oh, hyung! Hyung!

550
00:40:23,135 --> 00:40:25,887
What on earth are you doing, standing in line?

551
00:40:25,887 --> 00:40:27,639
Come on, come inside!

552
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:31,643
These people came all the way here just to see you, hyung!

553
00:40:31,643 --> 00:40:34,396
They've been begging for me to let them see you.

554
00:40:34,396 --> 00:40:36,648
To have you read their faces.

555
00:40:36,648 --> 00:40:39,401
Look, they brought pepper! And ice!

556
00:40:39,401 --> 00:40:41,653
Cold, cold!

557
00:40:42,904 --> 00:40:43,655
Mr. Kim!

558
00:40:43,655 --> 00:40:44,906
What on--!

559
00:40:44,906 --> 00:40:46,658
Oh, don't be so surprised!

560
00:40:46,658 --> 00:40:49,911
Ha, how much is that ice and pepper worth then?

561
00:40:49,911 --> 00:40:52,414
Why are you standing in line, madam?

562
00:40:52,414 --> 00:40:57,169
Why, I'm here to see the legendary Mr. Kim, the best physiognomist in all of Joseon!

563
00:40:57,169 --> 00:40:59,421
Of course I can stand in line.

564
00:41:02,424 --> 00:41:03,925
Now, this way, please.

565
00:41:03,925 --> 00:41:05,177
What are you doing?

566
00:41:05,177 --> 00:41:09,931
I've found you a nice house with a tiled roof, right across from here.

567
00:41:09,931 --> 00:41:11,933
Wouldn't it be better to greet customers there?

568
00:41:11,933 --> 00:41:14,186
I've also prepared a palanquin for you.

569
00:41:14,186 --> 00:41:15,937
A palanquin?

570
00:41:16,438 --> 00:41:18,440
It was the least I could do for my business partner.

571
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,192
Paeng-heon, how does it feel?

572
00:41:20,192 --> 00:41:22,694
Doesn't it feel like treading on clouds?

573
00:41:22,694 --> 00:41:27,949
Hyung, this is amazing. I feel like all of Hanyang is at my fingertips.

574
00:41:27,949 --> 00:41:31,703
Ladies! Wouldn't you like to go on a ride on this with me?

575
00:41:32,454 --> 00:41:34,956
Next time, then!

576
00:41:34,956 --> 00:41:37,709
Oh, shut the hell up, jeez.

577
00:41:39,961 --> 00:41:41,963
Do you think all this corruption

578
00:41:42,714 --> 00:41:46,468
is due to my own incompetence?

579
00:41:51,473 --> 00:41:55,977
The corruption of government officials has always existed, large or small,

580
00:41:55,977 --> 00:41:58,980
during any dynasty and any time period, Your Majesty.

581
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:00,982
I am talking of the present.

582
00:42:00,982 --> 00:42:03,485
Why do you think it has increased so much?

583
00:42:04,736 --> 00:42:06,738
We have been able to find a skilled physiognomist

584
00:42:06,738 --> 00:42:10,492
to lend a hand in investigations, Your Majesty.

585
00:42:11,743 --> 00:42:14,746
He is currently working for the Ministry of Justice

586
00:42:14,746 --> 00:42:17,499
and his talents are such that he is excellent

587
00:42:17,499 --> 00:42:22,504
at discovering the faults that people keep hidden.

588
00:42:35,767 --> 00:42:40,021
Your Majesty. It is an -

589
00:42:40,772 --> 00:42:43,275
It is an honor to meet you.

590
00:42:49,114 --> 00:42:50,949
So you are the man

591
00:42:51,574 --> 00:42:54,577
who can look into people's hearts?

592
00:42:58,623 --> 00:43:01,876
I... well, I...

593
00:43:02,127 --> 00:43:04,879
I'm not doing it on purpose, Your Majesty.

594
00:43:06,131 --> 00:43:08,883
It is only a small parlor trick of mine.

595
00:43:28,028 --> 00:43:31,531
A marvelous skill. Nevertheless.

596
00:43:31,531 --> 00:43:35,785
You may be able to estimate a person's past through their appearance,

597
00:43:37,037 --> 00:43:39,539
but to foretell their future?

598
00:43:39,539 --> 00:43:41,541
Wouldn't that be difficult?

599
00:43:41,541 --> 00:43:44,794
Isn't that something only the gods can know?

600
00:43:44,794 --> 00:43:48,798
Y- Yes.

601
00:43:48,798 --> 00:43:51,551
Well, to be exact...

602
00:43:52,052 --> 00:43:56,056
If I look at not only a person's face but also the way they talk and move

603
00:43:56,056 --> 00:44:01,061
I can guess both their past and their future, nine times out of ten.

604
00:44:01,811 --> 00:44:04,814
Of course I am unable to discern the little details, but generally speaking -

605
00:44:04,814 --> 00:44:06,566
Nonsense!

606
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,322
Such a talent must only be used

607
00:44:12,322 --> 00:44:15,575
to encourage people or give them courage.

608
00:44:15,575 --> 00:44:18,870
If it is used to root out people's faults and cause grievances

609
00:44:18,870 --> 00:44:21,623
it would be better for you to stay silent.

610
00:44:21,623 --> 00:44:24,375
I will watch and wait for the time being,

611
00:44:24,375 --> 00:44:26,628
but if there are any negative consequences

612
00:44:26,628 --> 00:44:29,881
I will have you expelled from court immediately.

613
00:44:41,392 --> 00:44:43,895
Hah, was I the one who wanted to see him?

614
00:44:43,895 --> 00:44:47,148
What kind of person asks to see someone first and does nothing but yell at them?

615
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,444
If you're the king you can do as you bloody well like?

616
00:44:52,153 --> 00:44:54,656
- What's this stupid dog doing here anyway?
- Haven't I told you he left for work

617
00:44:54,656 --> 00:44:57,158
and he hasn't come back yet?

618
00:44:57,158 --> 00:44:59,410
Come back tomorrow. Tomorrow.

619
00:44:59,410 --> 00:45:02,789
You impudent - How dare you -

620
00:45:02,789 --> 00:45:04,290
What's happening?

621
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:07,544
Nothing. Close the door - It's just -

622
00:45:07,544 --> 00:45:11,089
Not only did they come in the middle of the night, they've come empty handed too!

623
00:45:11,089 --> 00:45:14,842
What kind of people are you supposed to be, to be so rude?

624
00:45:15,593 --> 00:45:20,139
Why don't you come tomorrow, and leave your, er, swords behind -

625
00:45:20,139 --> 00:45:22,892
And bring something while you're at it, even if it's just a stupid dog.

626
00:45:26,145 --> 00:45:29,899


627
00:45:29,899 --> 00:45:37,156
Your Majesty!

628
00:45:39,158 --> 00:45:43,413
Hahahaha, what? Are you kidding me?

629
00:45:43,413 --> 00:45:45,915
You're the king?

630
00:45:47,250 --> 00:45:50,253
- Hyung. Hyung.
- King. He's the king.

631
00:45:52,922 --> 00:45:54,465
...I guess you are the king.

632
00:46:05,268 --> 00:46:07,228
I have come in person

633
00:46:07,228 --> 00:46:09,939
to ask of you a favor.

634
00:46:09,939 --> 00:46:13,026
An important one, that not even the scribes

635
00:46:13,526 --> 00:46:15,987
should hear about.

636
00:46:16,904 --> 00:46:22,285
There are several men in Joseon who desire the throne.

637
00:46:23,286 --> 00:46:27,040
If you use physiognomy to identify them and tell me who they are

638
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:32,420
I will use the information to prepare for any rebellions that might happen.

639
00:46:35,506 --> 00:46:40,219
Your Majesty, I do not yet know what conquerors and traitors look like.

640
00:46:40,219 --> 00:46:41,971
I am unable to do it.

641
00:46:41,971 --> 00:46:43,765
With your own eyes, find the men who would not hesitate

642
00:46:43,765 --> 00:46:46,934
to step on other people to see themselves rulers,

643
00:46:46,934 --> 00:46:50,980
who would not hesitate to brutally murder innocents to become king.

644
00:46:52,273 --> 00:46:55,026
My illness worsens day by day, 

645
00:46:55,026 --> 00:46:57,779
and it gets harder and harder to tell the future of Joseon.

646
00:46:58,529 --> 00:47:01,532
I find that I wish to rely on you.

647
00:47:01,532 --> 00:47:03,785
Will you disguise yourself as one of the palace eunuchs

648
00:47:03,785 --> 00:47:05,787
and observe these people at my side?

649
00:47:05,787 --> 00:47:07,038
When judging someone's character,

650
00:47:07,038 --> 00:47:11,542
isn't it best to observe within the environment with which he is most familiar?

651
00:47:12,752 --> 00:47:16,881
Do you have any clever ideas?

652
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:29,560
A man who killed his brothers to ascend to the throne.

653
00:47:30,561 --> 00:47:34,565
Yi Bangwon. The face of a traitor.

654
00:47:43,074 --> 00:47:46,327
Hyung. Do you think if we succeed

655
00:47:46,327 --> 00:47:48,871
- We'll get a huge reward?
- What?

656
00:47:49,705 --> 00:47:53,751
Well, of course! It was a direct order by the King himself.

657
00:47:53,751 --> 00:47:56,504
He'll give you a government position at the very least.

658
00:47:57,755 --> 00:47:59,757
Yes. A government position.

659
00:48:00,258 --> 00:48:03,261
I wasn't so sure if my luck was good or bad

660
00:48:03,261 --> 00:48:05,012
but everything is starting to make sense now!

661
00:48:05,012 --> 00:48:08,266
Things are finally beginning to look up. I knew my fortunes would get better when I got older.

662
00:48:09,016 --> 00:48:10,268
Is that so?

663
00:48:10,268 --> 00:48:14,063
Wow. You'll be Lord Kim Naekyung soon!

664
00:48:14,063 --> 00:48:16,315
Let me have a look at you.

665
00:48:16,315 --> 00:48:18,067
Oh, my Lord!

666
00:48:18,067 --> 00:48:20,319


667
00:48:25,825 --> 00:48:28,828
His Majesty has sent me a rare painting himself?

668
00:48:28,828 --> 00:48:32,582
The first person I saw was Prime Minister Hwangbo In.

669
00:48:33,833 --> 00:48:37,837
He is a generic nobleman, who has only ever looked in one direction.

670
00:48:37,837 --> 00:48:40,590
He is satisfied with what he has

671
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:43,342
and even procrastinates a little.

672
00:48:43,342 --> 00:48:46,095
What of my younger brother, Grand Prince Anpyeong?

673
00:48:46,095 --> 00:48:49,849
Grand Prince Anpyeong. A man who hides nothing.

674
00:48:49,849 --> 00:48:52,351
He has an outstanding eye for beauty.

675
00:48:53,102 --> 00:48:57,356
He does not consider the fact that he was born royalty to be of great import.

676
00:48:57,356 --> 00:49:02,111
He is a sensitive man who will never be able to take lives with his own hands.

677
00:49:05,615 --> 00:49:07,366
Yes. Whenever he would see an insect

678
00:49:07,366 --> 00:49:10,870
he would refuse to kill it, but instead take out ink and paper and paint it.

679
00:49:10,870 --> 00:49:13,873
Lord Shin Sookju is a very intelligent man

680
00:49:13,873 --> 00:49:17,877
who must have ascended to a high position quite easily.

681
00:49:18,377 --> 00:49:23,382
It seems as if he is less interested in power than he is in women.

682
00:49:27,136 --> 00:49:28,888
Soon it will be time

683
00:49:30,139 --> 00:49:33,434
for you to see Grand Prince Suyang.

684
00:49:34,685 --> 00:49:38,939
He is the most ambitious of my brothers.

685
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:41,942
You must observe him even more carefully

686
00:49:42,693 --> 00:49:45,946
and tell me what is inside him.

687
00:50:16,602 --> 00:50:18,938
His Majesty has sent me a painting?

688
00:50:28,489 --> 00:50:30,741
This is Grand Prince Suyang?

689
00:50:55,224 --> 00:50:57,476
Grand Prince Suyang is a man who fears the king

690
00:50:57,476 --> 00:51:01,480
and will never be capable of usurping the throne by force.

691
00:51:01,480 --> 00:51:03,732
He is easily satisfied with the smallest of delights,

692
00:51:03,732 --> 00:51:07,486
so I am sure that you need not worry about him.

693
00:51:08,487 --> 00:51:10,239
Truly?

694
00:51:10,239 --> 00:51:12,491
I am certain, Your Majesty.

695
00:51:19,999 --> 00:51:22,293
Do you have any children?

696
00:51:22,293 --> 00:51:24,545
I have one son.

697
00:51:24,545 --> 00:51:27,548
The gods will decide my time of death

698
00:51:27,548 --> 00:51:30,551
but I can't help but worry for the Crown Prince.

699
00:51:30,551 --> 00:51:32,553
He is only a child.

700
00:51:32,553 --> 00:51:35,723
How is he to endure this cold, harsh world?

701
00:51:37,224 --> 00:51:39,226
It is all I can think about.

702
00:51:56,619 --> 00:51:58,621
These men passed the entrance exam with the best results.

703
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:12,676
What is it?

704
00:52:12,676 --> 00:52:14,470
Is he someone you know?

705
00:52:15,471 --> 00:52:16,722
No...

706
00:52:17,723 --> 00:52:19,975
His face just... looks familiar, that's all...

707
00:52:19,975 --> 00:52:22,478
No, I must be mistaken.

708
00:52:23,812 --> 00:52:26,982
He's even changed his name.

709
00:52:28,734 --> 00:52:31,236
This is a question for Candidate Byeong.

710
00:52:31,236 --> 00:52:33,489
You received the best scores out of everyone.

711
00:52:33,489 --> 00:52:36,992
What was the biggest hardship you faced while preparing for the entrance exam?

712
00:52:46,043 --> 00:52:49,046
It was not letting myself get satisfied with my fate.

713
00:53:00,057 --> 00:53:01,058
Father!

714
00:53:02,559 --> 00:53:05,062
Fate? Fate?!

715
00:53:07,064 --> 00:53:09,066
How on earth did you think of coming here?

716
00:53:09,066 --> 00:53:11,568
I told you that I was going to become a government official, didn't I?

717
00:53:11,819 --> 00:53:14,071
I was unable to take the test under my own name

718
00:53:14,822 --> 00:53:16,573
so I borrowed the name of someone else.

719
00:53:16,573 --> 00:53:18,075
Good Lord!

720
00:53:18,826 --> 00:53:22,079
But... how come you're here, Father?

721
00:53:22,079 --> 00:53:24,832
Me? Well, Lord Kim Jongseo...

722
00:53:26,083 --> 00:53:29,586
How dare you try to change the subject when your father asked you a question?

723
00:53:32,339 --> 00:53:35,592
Are you giving him special treatment already because he had the best test scores?

724
00:53:37,344 --> 00:53:38,095


725
00:53:46,353 --> 00:53:48,105
I'm sorry, Father.

726
00:53:54,361 --> 00:53:56,363
Run along, then.

727
00:53:57,865 --> 00:53:59,366
What?

728
00:54:00,117 --> 00:54:02,369
As long as things have turned out this way, 

729
00:54:03,871 --> 00:54:05,622
I might as well wish you good luck.

730
00:54:15,174 --> 00:54:17,176
I knew this would happen!

731
00:54:18,177 --> 00:54:20,929
First place! He was first place!

732
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,183
Jinhyung's going to go on to be prime minister some day -

733
00:54:24,183 --> 00:54:26,185
That's never going to happen.

734
00:54:26,935 --> 00:54:29,688
It's alright now, as long as he's just a low-ranking employee.

735
00:54:29,688 --> 00:54:31,940
But he lied to get himself there.

736
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:35,194
He'll be lucky if he gets appointed the mayor of a small village, let alone prime minister.

737
00:54:41,700 --> 00:54:43,452
Are you Kim Naekyung?

738
00:54:44,203 --> 00:54:45,954
Yes, I am.

739
00:54:46,455 --> 00:54:51,084
We are here from the Royal Secretariat to pass on a letter from the King.

740
00:54:51,335 --> 00:54:53,211
Kim Naekyung.

741
00:54:54,254 --> 00:54:56,256
Receive the King's letter.

742
00:55:12,481 --> 00:55:14,733
I will already be not of this world

743
00:55:14,733 --> 00:55:17,653
by the time you are reading this.

744
00:55:18,403 --> 00:55:21,406
I cannot stop thinking of my son, who will be alone in this world.

745
00:55:21,907 --> 00:55:25,202
I am unsure that I will be able to close my eyes in peace.

746
00:55:26,244 --> 00:55:30,248
It will prove difficult for the Crown Prince to maintain the throne.

747
00:55:30,248 --> 00:55:33,251
You must go to Kim Jongseo and help him.

748
00:55:34,503 --> 00:55:37,005
You said you are father to a son as well

749
00:55:37,506 --> 00:55:40,759
so I assume that you too know what it feels like.

750
00:55:40,759 --> 00:55:44,513
I entreat you to think of the Crown Prince as you would your own child

751
00:55:44,513 --> 00:55:48,308
and protect the young king with the best of your ability.

752 
00:56:06,451 --> 00:56:09,705
I see His Majesty was paying close attention as well.

753
00:56:09,705 --> 00:56:11,456
Nonetheless, my lord.

754
00:56:12,708 --> 00:56:16,461
None of the people I saw had the face of a traitor.

755
00:56:18,964 --> 00:56:21,758
What did you think of Suyang?

756
00:56:22,759 --> 00:56:25,512
I took care to pay special attention to him

757
00:56:25,512 --> 00:56:29,766
as the King himself told me to take special care, and the world regards him your archenemy.

758
00:56:30,267 --> 00:56:33,520
Yet he was the most ordinary of the lot, and his spirit was the weakest.

759
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:35,772
Ignorant fool!

760
00:56:36,773 --> 00:56:41,111
I may not know a thing about physiognomy, but even I can tell that Suyang has the face of a traitor.

761
00:56:42,112 --> 00:56:43,363
My lord?

762
00:56:43,613 --> 00:56:47,868
Follow me. You must see with your own eyes.

763
00:56:57,377 --> 00:57:01,000
His Highness the Grand Prince Suyang!

764
00:58:07,489 --> 00:58:09,491
With your own eyes, find the men who would not hesitate

765
00:58:09,991 --> 00:58:13,495
to step on other people to see themselves rulers,

766
00:58:13,995 --> 00:58:19,751
who would not hesitate to brutally murder innocents to become king.

767
00:58:24,255 --> 00:58:27,008
He has the visage of a predator that bites down on the throat, 

768
00:58:27,008 --> 00:58:30,261
the weakest part of an animal, and never ever lets go.

769
00:58:31,012 --> 00:58:33,098
This man's face is truly

770
00:58:36,226 --> 00:58:38,478
the face of a traitor.

771
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:43,483
You went hunting during the mourning period?

772
00:58:43,483 --> 00:58:46,736
I would fear what the people would think, if I were you.

773
00:58:46,736 --> 00:58:50,490
I merely went with a few acquaintances to shoot some arrows.

774
00:58:50,490 --> 00:58:54,742
I would not worry so much.

775
00:58:54,995 --> 00:58:56,496
But may I ask

776
00:58:58,289 --> 00:59:00,875
who your companion is?

777
00:59:01,626 --> 00:59:05,255
He is one of the men under my command.

778
00:59:07,507 --> 00:59:08,758
You don't happen to be the man

779
00:59:08,758 --> 00:59:13,513
who can see right through people just by looking at their faces?

780
00:59:19,519 --> 00:59:21,688
I was right!

781
00:59:21,688 --> 00:59:26,443
Don't tell me you plan to turn the former King's interest in face reading into a family tradition?

782
00:59:26,443 --> 00:59:27,444
Alright, then.

783
00:59:27,444 --> 00:59:30,196
What can you tell from my appearance?

784
00:59:31,197 --> 00:59:33,199
When I was a boy 

785
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:36,327
my grandmother often told me I had handsome ears.

786
00:59:36,327 --> 00:59:39,080
Do you agree with her?

787
00:59:42,083 --> 00:59:45,086
They are flawless, Your Highness.

788
00:59:50,091 --> 00:59:51,843
I'm planning to arrange a little party

789
00:59:51,843 --> 00:59:55,096
for some of my acquaintances soon.

790
00:59:55,096 --> 00:59:57,390
Wouldn't you like to drop by as well?

791
01:00:02,479 --> 01:00:03,980
I was a fool.

792
01:00:05,482 --> 01:00:07,233
I should have known that such a man could never be Suyang.

793
01:00:08,735 --> 01:00:12,739
The real Suyang would not hesitate to shed blood to ascend to the throne.

794
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,993
How on earth did he know beforehand that I would be there?

795
01:00:27,754 --> 01:00:30,006
You there! Kim Naekyung!

796
01:00:37,263 --> 01:00:39,265
Kim Naekyung, the face reader.

797
01:00:39,766 --> 01:00:41,017
Have you been well?

798
01:00:43,019 --> 01:00:45,813
He may cause trouble in the future. Kill him.

799
01:00:46,064 --> 01:00:48,066
Why don't you read my face too

800
01:00:48,316 --> 01:00:50,318
and not just Grand Prince Suyang's face?

801
01:01:13,716 --> 01:01:15,969
Kim Naekyung the face reader.

802
01:01:17,220 --> 01:01:20,473
You've been working quite hard in the government.

803
01:01:20,473 --> 01:01:22,225
Have you been following me since last time?

804
01:01:22,725 --> 01:01:27,480
I did tell Grand Prince Suyang to beware your quite extraordinary abilities.

805
01:01:27,981 --> 01:01:32,777
Had I not, would we have been able to fool you and the King?

806
01:01:34,612 --> 01:01:36,114
Mr. Face Reader...

807
01:01:37,615 --> 01:01:40,118
Won't you help us change the world?

808
01:01:41,869 --> 01:01:43,246
It's very simple, really.

809
01:01:43,496 --> 01:01:46,624
All you have to do is pass on a few words to the new King.

810
01:01:48,876 --> 01:01:50,128
Just say the former king

811
01:01:50,378 --> 01:01:53,631
instructed you to seek out the people likeliest to plot a coup

812
01:01:53,881 --> 01:01:57,135
and you came to the conclusion that Kim Jongseo fits the description.

813
01:01:57,385 --> 01:02:00,388
Tell him that Kim Jongseo is planning to usurp the throne by force

814
01:02:00,638 --> 01:02:02,390
so he must be arrested immediately!

815
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:04,991
What do you think?

816
01:02:06,519 --> 01:02:09,522
You want me to help get rid of Kim Jongseo and let Suyang become king?

817
01:02:09,522 --> 01:02:12,775
I will never aid in plotting treason even if you slit my throat.

818
01:02:12,775 --> 01:02:16,279
You think I will let you die that easily?

819
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:19,532
I will put out your eyes so you will never 

820
01:02:19,782 --> 01:02:24,037
be able to read faces again, and toss them out onto the street.

821
01:02:24,037 --> 01:02:25,538
Do you think I'll stop at that?

822
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:29,542
I will chop off your brother-in-law's legs -

823
01:02:29,792 --> 01:02:30,543
- you bastard! -

824
01:02:30,793 --> 01:02:33,046
- and although I don't yet know where he's hiding

825
01:02:33,546 --> 01:02:35,548
I will find your only son, 

826
01:02:35,798 --> 01:02:37,800
whatever it takes, 

827
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:40,678
and rip all four limbs from his body.

828
01:02:44,432 --> 01:02:45,433
Son of a bitch!

829
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:54,942
Kim Naekyung, listen to me.

830
01:02:56,944 --> 01:03:01,699
Are you going to live like this your entire life, a worthless man from a traitor's family?

831
01:03:01,699 --> 01:03:03,701
Once Suyang becomes king

832
01:03:04,202 --> 01:03:06,954
your descendants will have fame and fortune

833
01:03:07,205 --> 01:03:10,333
and untold power, for generations and generations to come.

834
01:03:10,333 --> 01:03:12,585
You will never get this opportunity again.

835
01:03:13,753 --> 01:03:15,004
Think about it.

836
01:03:53,751 --> 01:03:55,753
They'll dog our every step.

837
01:03:57,255 --> 01:03:58,506
Even if we escape...

838
01:04:00,758 --> 01:04:04,011
Wherever we go... They will find us.

839
01:04:08,307 --> 01:04:10,059
Let's do as they say.

840
01:04:11,000 --> 01:04:13,854
I heard that Suyang is a loyal man.

841
01:04:13,854 --> 01:04:18,000
He feeds his people wine and meat, and takes good care of them.

842
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,987
How could you speak so freely

843
01:04:20,987 --> 01:04:24,073
of aiding a coup?

844
01:04:25,116 --> 01:04:27,118
Please think about it, hyung.

845
01:04:28,369 --> 01:04:32,373
Us... well, it doesn't matter how we live

846
01:04:33,874 --> 01:04:35,626
but what about Jinhyung?

847
01:04:38,629 --> 01:04:41,924
He's hiding his name just to keep a crappy government job.

848
01:04:43,676 --> 01:04:46,345
He's Prime Minister material, he is!

849
01:04:47,054 --> 01:04:50,016
Didn't you say you were going to save the family with face reading?

850
01:04:50,016 --> 01:04:51,767
This is the way to do it.

851
01:04:54,937 --> 01:04:57,189
Just think of Jinhyung.

852
01:05:37,063 --> 01:05:37,813
Why --

853
01:05:39,813 --> 01:05:42,318
For what reason have you come all this way?

854
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:44,070
We are here on the orders of Minister Kim Jongseo.

855
01:05:44,070 --> 01:05:47,823
We ask that His Highness hand over a complete list of the soldiers

856
01:05:47,823 --> 01:05:49,075
he keeps illegally under his command.

857
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:53,579
Should not the Minister be concerned with the education of the young king?

858
01:05:53,579 --> 01:05:55,831
Why does he waste manpower on such trifle matters?

859
01:05:55,831 --> 01:05:58,334
Are these all the men you have with you?

860
01:05:58,584 --> 01:06:03,088
Three is enough men to hunt a tiger, do you not think?

861
01:06:05,341 --> 01:06:06,091
How dare you...

862
01:06:07,092 --> 01:06:08,844
That's enough, Your Highness!

863
01:06:38,874 --> 01:06:39,875
Excellent shot, Your Highness!

864
01:06:40,125 --> 01:06:41,877
Your arrow has hit the tiger directly.

865
01:06:42,127 --> 01:06:45,130
I fired because its moving about was getting on my nerves.

866
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:47,883
Now I see it was a tiger you'd caught first.

867
01:06:49,385 --> 01:06:52,388
Next time, will you give me the opportunity to kill one myself?

868
01:06:52,388 --> 01:06:53,389
Of course.

869
01:06:55,641 --> 01:07:00,396
Ah! How about giving the tiger we caught today to Lord Kim Jongseo as a gift?

870
01:07:01,897 --> 01:07:03,899
Should we send him its skin, Your Highness?

871
01:07:04,149 --> 01:07:05,901
Or should we send him its head?

872
01:07:06,151 --> 01:07:08,404
Oh, what a dilemma!

873
01:07:17,413 --> 01:07:18,914
My lord! My lord!

874
01:07:19,665 --> 01:07:20,916
You must calm down, my lord.

875
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:05,085
You thought nobody would recognize you like this?

876
01:08:05,085 --> 01:08:06,587
It seems the rumors are true.

877
01:08:06,587 --> 01:08:10,090
They say there's a face reader caught in the crossfire between a tiger and a wolf.

878
01:08:10,841 --> 01:08:13,594
You're here to see for yourself which side is better.

879
01:08:13,844 --> 01:08:14,845
What are you doing here?

880
01:08:16,347 --> 01:08:20,100
Every single face reader or fortune teller in Hanyang whose name is worth something has gathered here.

881
01:08:20,100 --> 01:08:22,102  
I wouldn't miss out on an opportunity like this for the world.

882
01:08:22,102 --> 01:08:24,604
See how quick the people move?

883
01:08:25,856 --> 01:08:27,858
If they think they see someone powerful,

884
01:08:28,108 --> 01:08:29,859
they swarm to him.

885
01:08:30,861 --> 01:08:34,615
Who would want to take the side of the child king?

886
01:08:34,615 --> 01:08:35,616
Oh, my...

887
01:08:36,367 --> 01:08:38,368
It's an exact copy of the throne room.

888
01:09:25,666 --> 01:09:29,670
Shall I hear my fortunes now?

889
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:35,425
You must be the one fated to rule the kingdom east of the dragon emperor, Your Highness.

890
01:09:36,426 --> 01:09:40,680
Your Majesty!

891
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:45,935
Please lead the foolish people of Joseon to greatness!

892
01:09:51,441 --> 01:09:55,946
The five peaks of your visage seem to have absorbed the energy and vigor of Mt. Samgak, my lord.

893
01:09:56,947 --> 01:09:58,448
Truly?

894
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,701
I'm sorry?

895
01:10:00,701 --> 01:10:03,704
I'm asking you if that is truly what you see.

896
01:10:04,705 --> 01:10:05,956
Of course, Your Highness.

897
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:23,974
I'm saying this because you don't have the expression of someone telling the truth.

898
01:10:25,976 --> 01:10:28,228
Now tell me the actual readings.

899
01:10:31,231 --> 01:10:31,982
Grand Prince...

900
01:10:32,232 --> 01:10:33,483
Tell me!

901
01:10:36,737 --> 01:10:39,239
Grand Prince, you will never be able to

902
01:10:39,990 --> 01:10:42,743
ascend to the throne if not through treason.

903
01:10:43,243 --> 01:10:44,995
Please do not go down the road of traitors.

904
01:10:45,245 --> 01:10:46,747
The entire kingdom will fall into tragedy!

905
01:10:46,747 --> 01:10:47,998
Is this kingdom

906
01:10:48,749 --> 01:10:51,251
ruled by the Yi family, or ruled by the Kim family?

907
01:10:51,501 --> 01:10:55,005
How dare they attempt to tamper with a country King Taejo founded on iron and blood?

908
01:10:56,005 --> 01:10:59,760
The old tiger you've chosen to support might overthrow the young king tomorrow

909
01:11:00,260 --> 01:11:02,012
and seize power for himself!

910
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:13,023
I knew you were a lackey of Kim Jongseo.

911
01:11:38,423 --> 01:11:41,426
Oh, it's you!

912
01:11:44,429 --> 01:11:46,056
And just in time, too!

913
01:11:46,306 --> 01:11:49,308
Things were just starting to get a little depressing.

914
01:11:50,060 --> 01:11:52,062
Why don't you tell me my fortune?

915
01:11:52,312 --> 01:11:55,565
What do you think? Will I become king?

916
01:11:58,068 --> 01:11:59,319
Tell me!

917
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,322
Do I have the face of a future king?

918
01:12:10,330 --> 01:12:12,332
There must be something queer about my face.

919
01:12:14,084 --> 01:12:18,088
To think that it rendered the world's best face reader speechless!

920
01:12:19,339 --> 01:12:24,094
Don't you think you should make a decision soon?

921
01:12:25,846 --> 01:12:28,598
By the time I become king,

922
01:12:29,099 --> 01:12:31,143
it will be too late.

923
01:12:44,072 --> 01:12:47,325
All you had to do was say "Yes, you will become king."

924
01:12:48,827 --> 01:12:50,328
Why did you have to be such a moron?

925
01:13:07,095 --> 01:13:08,346
Isn't it tiring?

926
01:13:10,098 --> 01:13:10,849
What?

927
01:13:11,850 --> 01:13:14,352
You say it's a small position

928
01:13:16,104 --> 01:13:18,607
but isn't most of what you do menial?

929
01:13:20,609 --> 01:13:24,613
If I can make one more person smile because of me...

930
01:13:25,363 --> 01:13:27,032
That makes me happy.

931
01:13:27,324 --> 01:13:29,659
You can't even use your own name.

932
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:35,123
If you rise to a higher rank you will be able to please even more people.

933
01:13:35,707 --> 01:13:37,208
Don't you feel any resentment?

934
01:13:41,004 --> 01:13:42,130
I do.

935
01:13:47,344 --> 01:13:51,640
I did feel resentment. I even looked up the sins of my grandfather.

936
01:13:55,560 --> 01:13:57,646
He had a great many sins.

937
01:13:58,772 --> 01:14:00,565
Many people died because of him

938
01:14:00,899 --> 01:14:03,068
and the court lost a lot of money.

939
01:14:08,948 --> 01:14:12,035
I thought that instead of resenting my destiny,

940
01:14:12,827 --> 01:14:15,038
doing my job, even if it's a menial one,

941
01:14:17,082 --> 01:14:20,460
might just be what would make up

942
01:14:21,087 --> 01:14:23,588
for the sins of my grandfather.

943
01:14:29,761 --> 01:14:31,012
Thank you.

944
01:14:33,598 --> 01:14:34,599
What?

945
01:14:42,857 --> 01:14:47,612
I think your face has changed a little.

946
01:14:49,864 --> 01:14:52,367
I think my eyesight's gotten a little worse.

947
01:14:52,700 --> 01:14:55,328
Perhaps it was because of all the reading I did under bad lighting.

948
01:14:57,288 --> 01:14:59,374
The eyes are the windows to the heart.

949
01:15:01,084 --> 01:15:05,964
You must always be cautious if you feel your visage might be changing for the worse.

950
01:15:07,841 --> 01:15:08,633
Yes, Father.

951
01:15:10,218 --> 01:15:13,513
I, too, should become a father who my son would not be ashamed of.

952
01:15:30,447 --> 01:15:32,949
The strength of Grand Prince Suyang has reached its peak.

953
01:15:33,575 --> 01:15:37,745
If a face like yours and a face like the Grand Prince's go head to head

954
01:15:38,079 --> 01:15:40,081
you will lose almost every time.

955
01:15:40,373 --> 01:15:42,250
We must act in haste.

956
01:15:42,917 --> 01:15:44,627
When shall we begin?

957
01:15:44,627 --> 01:15:48,965
I will have something prepared for after the banquet with the King.

958
01:15:48,965 --> 01:15:53,386
The only weakness Suyang has is his inexperience compared to you.

959
01:15:54,554 --> 01:15:59,225
Yet even this is useless because there is a mysterious man acting as his advisor.

960
01:15:59,642 --> 01:16:03,104
We have prepared a child who is similar in appearance to the king.

961
01:16:04,606 --> 01:16:07,066
The corpse of the real king

962
01:16:07,567 --> 01:16:10,403
will be torn into three hundred pieces of flesh

963
01:16:11,112 --> 01:16:14,532
and scattered over the entire country.

964
01:16:15,283 --> 01:16:18,244
We will have no chance unless we act first.

965
01:16:19,871 --> 01:16:21,623
We must make the first move.

966
01:16:29,505 --> 01:16:31,257
This truly is my father's writing.

967
01:16:32,008 --> 01:16:36,012
My father asked you to identify traitors by their faces...

968
01:16:37,764 --> 01:16:41,768
Isn't this a portrait of Grand Prince Suyang?

969
01:16:42,268 --> 01:16:46,772
If you will turn to the portrait of the late King Taejong, Your Majesty.

970
01:16:47,523 --> 01:16:51,778
Does it not bear a likeness to Suyang's current appearance?

971
01:16:53,279 --> 01:16:55,031
What are you trying to say?

972
01:16:56,000 --> 01:17:00,036
Are you claiming that since my great-grandfather plotted a coup to become king,

973
01:17:00,286 --> 01:17:02,038
Grand Prince Suyang will do the same as well?

974
01:17:03,289 --> 01:17:04,290
Your Majesty.

975
01:17:04,791 --> 01:17:06,793
I have read the face of Grand Prince Suyang.

976
01:17:07,293 --> 01:17:09,796
Not only has he inherited his grandfather's character,

977
01:17:10,046 --> 01:17:14,050
but his features also betray a strong lust for power.

978
01:17:14,300 --> 01:17:17,804
To me, physiognomy sounds no better than a childish riddle.

979
01:17:18,054 --> 01:17:19,806
Father actually took this seriously?

980
01:17:21,307 --> 01:17:22,558
Your Majesty.

981
01:17:23,559 --> 01:17:28,064
Are you that scared of the Grand Prince, Minister?

982
01:17:28,064 --> 01:17:30,066
This is not a matter of fear.

983
01:17:30,066 --> 01:17:32,819
This is a matter concerning the fate of the country.

984
01:17:32,819 --> 01:17:35,571
I am not saying this just because of physiognomy readings.

985
01:17:35,571 --> 01:17:39,575
There have been countless rumors about the actions of Grand Prince Suyang.

986
01:17:39,826 --> 01:17:43,079
You must strike down his forces before it is too late.

987
01:17:47,083 --> 01:17:48,835
With this move, a mere footsoldier

988
01:17:49,085 --> 01:17:51,087
threatens the life of the king.

989
01:17:55,341 --> 01:17:57,844
9 PM!

990
01:18:00,596 --> 01:18:03,099
9 PM!

991
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:09,856
You'll be tired once you begin your journey to China tomorrow, Uncle.

992
01:18:09,856 --> 01:18:11,607
Shall we call it a day?

993
01:18:12,608 --> 01:18:16,362
It will be little more than a sightseeing trip on horseback. You need not worry.

994
01:18:20,116 --> 01:18:23,369
If you'll excuse me, I must briefly use the restroom.

995
01:18:36,632 --> 01:18:37,884
Aim for under the earlobe.

996
01:18:38,134 --> 01:18:40,386
All you have to do is push it in.

997
01:18:42,388 --> 01:18:45,641
Wouldn't it be better if I did it, Your Highness?

998
01:19:43,491 --> 01:19:47,286
Minister Kim Jongseo and Kim Naekyung sought audience with me today.

999
01:19:49,038 --> 01:19:51,290
They said you might do something dreadful

1000
01:19:52,541 --> 01:19:54,794
in your desire to become king.

1001
01:19:57,046 --> 01:19:59,590
Who could know the future for sure?

1002
01:19:59,590 --> 01:20:03,594
Everything they say is guesswork based on people's faces.

1003
01:20:04,345 --> 01:20:06,847
It isn't as if they've been inside their minds.

1004
01:20:07,098 --> 01:20:10,142
Nobody knows for sure what lurks inside themselves.

1005
01:20:10,142 --> 01:20:12,645
Do not worry too much about such libel.

1006
01:20:13,521 --> 01:20:15,022
I do not want to believe them either.

1007
01:20:16,774 --> 01:20:18,999
Uncle, all I can remember is the kindness

1008
01:20:20,277 --> 01:20:22,530
you showed me when playing with me when I was young.

1009
01:20:24,031 --> 01:20:28,577
It is the only way I wish to remember you.

1010
01:20:29,328 --> 01:20:32,832
Even if my destiny is to live a life of immorality,

1011
01:20:34,083 --> 01:20:38,587
I promise you that I will do all I can

1012
01:20:39,338 --> 01:20:41,882
to fight my destiny and live a different life.

1013
01:20:58,649 --> 01:20:59,650
What is it?

1014
01:21:00,651 --> 01:21:03,404
We have received instructions to change the guards around this time.

1015
01:21:03,779 --> 01:21:04,321
From whom?

1016
01:21:04,572 --> 01:21:08,576
- From Minister Kim Jongseo...
- Since when was the Minister in charge of the palace guards?

1017
01:21:08,909 --> 01:21:11,162
I permitted it myself.

1018
01:21:11,662 --> 01:21:17,168
I thought the new rotation schedule was causing the guards fatigue.

1019
01:21:18,753 --> 01:21:23,507
I will retire to my bedchambers now, Uncle.

1020
01:21:39,565 --> 01:21:40,816
The face of a traitor...

1021
01:21:59,877 --> 01:22:04,381
Before Suyang departed for China, he had many of his men lie in wait near the palace.

1022
01:22:04,381 --> 01:22:08,636
I heard he had conversed with the king until late at night, so I thought it suspicious and searched the area

1023
01:22:09,637 --> 01:22:12,556
and discovered this poisoned needle in a crack in the floor.

1024
01:22:13,057 --> 01:22:16,560
The poison causes a slow death after ten days of fever.

1025
01:22:16,810 --> 01:22:18,812
It seems that he planned to have the king die

1026
01:22:19,313 --> 01:22:21,565
while he was abroad to evade suspicion.

1027
01:22:22,066 --> 01:22:24,568
The Grand Prince would resort to such foul play?

1028
01:22:25,069 --> 01:22:27,321
This must have been plotted by that advisor of his.

1029
01:22:27,821 --> 01:22:31,325
We must capture him while Suyang is abroad and learn of his plans.

1030
01:22:31,825 --> 01:22:33,327
How are we to catch him?

1031
01:22:33,577 --> 01:22:35,120
You said all you know is his voice.

1032
01:22:35,371 --> 01:22:37,414
Give me men, my lord.

1033
01:22:37,665 --> 01:22:40,459
I will find him even if I have to search all of Hanyang.

1034
01:22:41,502 --> 01:22:43,754
From researching the men closest to Suyang

1035
01:22:44,004 --> 01:22:46,006
we have found three suspicious people.

1036
01:22:46,257 --> 01:22:48,259
This man is called Ahn Kyungson

1037
01:22:48,509 --> 01:22:53,013
and was one of the royal bodyguards during King Sejong's reign but now guards Suyang instead.

1038
01:22:53,514 --> 01:22:56,016
The next one is a scholar by the name of Yi Mongga

1039
01:22:56,016 --> 01:22:59,520
who couldn't take the entrance exam as he was born a bastard son.

1040
01:22:59,520 --> 01:23:02,273
They say he spends day and night drinking with gisaengs.

1041
01:23:03,274 --> 01:23:08,529
The last one - apart from the fact that he was once a low-ranking gatekeeper, not much is known about him.

1042
01:23:08,779 --> 01:23:10,531
He quit his job quite some time ago.

1043
01:23:11,031 --> 01:23:13,033
He's never come back since.

1044
01:23:14,034 --> 01:23:17,538
But why are you looking for the fellow missing a neck bone?

1045
01:23:17,788 --> 01:23:21,040
Don't tell me he got himself into some sort of trouble?

1046
01:23:22,793 --> 01:23:24,044
Missing a neck bone?

1047
01:23:24,044 --> 01:23:25,838
He always stands like this, doesn't he?

1048
01:23:29,133 --> 01:23:30,634
What is his name?

1049
01:23:31,135 --> 01:23:32,636
He is called Han Myunghoi.

1050
01:23:34,555 --> 01:23:35,556
Han Myunghoi.

1051
01:23:39,852 --> 01:23:42,104
What are you doing? The Grand Prince is not even here!

1052
01:23:42,104 --> 01:23:44,500
The advisor is a man called Han Myunghoi

1053
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:47,109
and it is said he has supported Suyang for about two years.

1054
01:23:47,609 --> 01:23:52,814
Yet there are few apart from Suyang himself who have seen his face.

1055
01:23:52,814 --> 01:23:52,865


1056
01:23:52,865 --> 01:23:56,368
I will be able to identify him just from his voice.

1057
01:23:59,621 --> 01:24:02,374
You've gathered quite a lot of trash.

1058
01:24:02,624 --> 01:24:04,126
Who is the man called Han Myunghoi?

1059
01:24:04,126 --> 01:24:04,877
Come out this instant!

1060
01:24:05,127 --> 01:24:06,628
There is no one here of that name.

1061
01:24:06,879 --> 01:24:09,381
Try looking yourself if you can!

1062
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:23,645
Open your mouth and say something.

1063
01:24:24,646 --> 01:24:25,647
Say what?

1064
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:27,149
Should I wail for you?

1065
01:24:27,149 --> 01:24:28,400
Did someone kick the bucket?

1066
01:24:29,151 --> 01:24:31,403
Or, what, shall I make chicken noises for you?

1067
01:24:37,409 --> 01:24:39,161


1068
01:24:47,419 --> 01:24:50,422


1069
01:24:55,928 --> 01:24:57,930
The King is furious that we broke into a house

1070
01:24:58,180 --> 01:25:01,183
while the owner was not present.

1071
01:25:01,934 --> 01:25:03,936
I heard he was reading physiognomy texts

1072
01:25:04,436 --> 01:25:06,939
so I had hoped perhaps he was finally

1073
01:25:06,939 --> 01:25:09,191
starting to think Suyang suspicious...

1074
01:25:09,858 --> 01:25:14,947
I was wrong. He worries for Suyang and has sent him several physicians

1075 
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:19,243
to cure the endemic he caught in China.

1076
01:25:20,494 --> 01:25:22,496
Perhaps blood really is thicker than water.

1077
01:25:23,747 --> 01:25:29,044
My lord... What did you just say?

1078
01:25:29,545 --> 01:25:32,548
Suyang fell ill with an endemic disease in China

1079
01:25:32,798 --> 01:25:35,050
but they say it is not a serious illness.

1080
01:25:35,551 --> 01:25:37,553
Did you say the King is looking at physiognomy texts?

1081
01:25:40,556 --> 01:25:41,807
I did.

1082
01:25:59,908 --> 01:26:04,788
The records of the late Han Dynasty are overflowing with stories of treason and rebellion...

1083
01:26:16,383 --> 01:26:17,634
This is it.

1084
01:26:27,644 --> 01:26:28,895
Fire! Fire!

1085
01:26:39,906 --> 01:26:40,657
Fire!

1086
01:26:42,659 --> 01:26:44,161
Were you very tired?

1087
01:26:44,161 --> 01:26:47,414
We could hear your sonorous snoring all the way from here.

1088
01:26:51,710 --> 01:26:52,711
I was snoring?

1089
01:26:53,545 --> 01:26:56,590
What - do I truly look like someone who snores?

1090
01:26:56,882 --> 01:26:58,842
I heard recently

1091
01:27:00,802 --> 01:27:03,764
that you can make people moles the size of watermelon seeds.

1092
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:11,646
Let me get this straight. You've acquired identification to get into Suyang's house

1093
01:27:11,646 --> 01:27:15,400
and you want me to come with you and make him some moles.

1094
01:27:20,405 --> 01:27:23,658
Did you truly think I would agree to such an outrageous request?

1095
01:27:25,160 --> 01:27:26,161
I did.

1096
01:27:26,912 --> 01:27:27,662
How come?

1097
01:27:30,415 --> 01:27:32,000
Because of this.

1098
01:27:33,919 --> 01:27:36,171
The partnership contract we signed.

1099
01:27:37,923 --> 01:27:39,466
What about it?

1100
01:27:39,466 --> 01:27:44,471
Were I to ever get caught with my hands on Suyang's face

1101
01:27:44,721 --> 01:27:47,933
and I said my partner made me do it,

1102
01:27:49,810 --> 01:27:51,311
what do you think will happen then?

1103
01:27:58,276 --> 01:28:00,529


1104
01:28:12,541 --> 01:28:15,292
Why do I feel so hot suddenly?

1105
01:28:20,048 --> 01:28:23,000
Give it to me, you bastard! Give it back!

1106
01:28:30,058 --> 01:28:32,561


1107
01:28:32,461 --> 01:28:34,062
What on earth -?

1108
01:28:50,078 --> 01:28:53,582
Candidate, how well do you know Minister Kim Jongseo?

1109
01:28:54,332 --> 01:28:57,085
I respect the Minister very much.

1110
01:28:57,335 --> 01:28:58,837
If Lord Kim Jongseo puts 

1111
01:28:59,087 --> 01:29:00,839
a yellow label next to someone's name

1112
01:29:01,089 --> 01:29:05,594
they will automatically be hired, which is why this is called Yellow Politics.

1113
01:29:05,844 --> 01:29:07,846
My lord, it is imperative that you 

1114
01:29:08,096 --> 01:29:12,851
ask Lord Kim Jongseo to stop using these yellow markers.

1115
01:29:13,101 --> 01:29:14,853
But if we weaken the power of Minister Kim

1116
01:29:15,228 --> 01:29:17,999
we will only be helping Grand Prince Suyang.

1117
01:29:18,356 --> 01:29:20,108
Can't you see that without this

1118
01:29:21,276 --> 01:29:23,778
there will be no way to defend against Suyang?

1119
01:29:25,780 --> 01:29:28,783
For the next five days, the treatment of Grand Prince Suyang

1120
01:29:29,034 --> 01:29:31,286
will be handed over to outside physicians.

1121
01:29:31,286 --> 01:29:34,581
The physicians currently in charge of treatment may return to court.

1122
01:29:51,598 --> 01:29:53,000
You're new?

1123
01:29:53,099 --> 01:29:53,850
Yes.

1124
01:30:05,362 --> 01:30:07,364
The security is tight.

1125
01:30:07,364 --> 01:30:08,865
Really tight.

1126
01:30:11,117 --> 01:30:13,119
This look becomes you.

1127
01:30:13,119 --> 01:30:14,871
I like it.

1128
01:30:16,373 --> 01:30:18,875
If I end up breathing my last today

1129
01:30:19,125 --> 01:30:21,378
I'll come back as a ghost and haunt you until you die.

1130
01:30:26,633 --> 01:30:28,134
Don't hit me in the head.

1131
01:30:52,408 --> 01:30:56,913
Once he inhales this medicine, he will neither feel pain nor remember anything.

1132
01:30:57,163 --> 01:30:59,707
But it's effects do not last long.

1133
01:30:59,707 --> 01:31:03,878
If we are unable to complete our task until this stick of incense burns up

1134
01:31:04,629 --> 01:31:08,299
all four of us will surely have our heads chopped off.

1135
01:32:02,186 --> 01:32:03,938
Do you have eyes or not?

1136
01:32:07,942 --> 01:32:10,695
It should be on the other side.

1137
01:33:34,028 --> 01:33:35,780
Hey! Hey!

1138
01:33:36,030 --> 01:33:40,034
- We're done here.
- It's over.

1139
01:34:11,566 --> 01:34:12,817
Oh God...

1140
01:34:14,819 --> 01:34:16,070
We almost died back there.

1141
01:34:17,822 --> 01:34:19,824
I thought my bladder might explode.

1142
01:34:20,825 --> 01:34:23,077
I feel like I'm peeing a river!

1143
01:34:29,917 --> 01:34:31,794
I was orphaned

1144
01:34:32,295 --> 01:34:34,797
and raised in a brothel ever since I was five.

1145
01:34:35,548 --> 01:34:38,801
In a brothel they'll beat you if you put a single toe out of line.

1146
01:34:38,801 --> 01:34:42,305
I didn't want to get beaten, I didn't want to starve

1147
01:34:42,305 --> 01:34:44,307
so I had to put my intuition to use

1148
01:34:44,557 --> 01:34:49,312
until one day, I came to own the biggest brothel in Hanyang.

1149
01:34:54,567 --> 01:34:56,569
I don't know about face reading

1150
01:34:57,111 --> 01:35:00,000
but I think I'm the one with better intuition.

1151
01:35:00,489 --> 01:35:03,000
Are you certain this will prevent a coup from happening?

1152
01:35:05,161 --> 01:35:06,662
It must.

1153
01:35:11,292 --> 01:35:13,419
If you succeed, don't forget me.

1154
01:35:15,046 --> 01:35:16,839
And if you fail, I had nothing to do with it.

1155
01:35:26,974 --> 01:35:28,975
Is that so?

1156
01:35:28,976 --> 01:35:33,731
Who was it that wrote the report on Minister Kim Jongseo's Yellow Politics?

1157
01:35:38,235 --> 01:35:39,987
I see.

1158
01:35:39,987 --> 01:35:43,991
What do you have to say regarding Yellow Politics?

1159
01:35:46,994 --> 01:35:48,996
Not long ago

1160
01:35:48,996 --> 01:35:53,501
I saw an official working for the Ministry of Finance had added a yellow marker to his name.

1161
01:35:53,751 --> 01:35:56,003
He was a man who had, as an Inspector General in the countryside,

1162
01:35:56,003 --> 01:35:59,256
blackmailed merchants in the marketplace into giving him money

1163
01:36:01,759 --> 01:36:04,011
and even molested a merchant's wife.

1164
01:36:05,262 --> 01:36:09,517
They say that the Minister's Yellow Politics is useful at finding hidden talent

1165
01:36:11,769 --> 01:36:14,271
but it also has these negative side effects.

1166
01:36:17,024 --> 01:36:21,278
You were very brave for bringing up the dark side of Yellow Politics.

1167
01:36:22,029 --> 01:36:24,031
I give you my thanks.

1168
01:36:26,534 --> 01:36:30,287
I believe something should be done...

1169
01:36:33,791 --> 01:36:35,543
regarding Lord Kim Jongseo.

1170
01:36:36,794 --> 01:36:40,548
About how he nominates people with yellow markers

1171
01:36:41,298 --> 01:36:45,803
and the way he slanders you and calls you a traitor.

1172
01:36:45,803 --> 01:36:50,057
Perhaps it is because you indulge him too much, Your Majesty.

1173
01:36:50,307 --> 01:36:52,309
My father trusted him.

1174
01:36:53,060 --> 01:36:54,812
I also thought...

1175
01:37:04,238 --> 01:37:06,490
Are you feeling unwell, Your Majesty?

1176
01:37:06,991 --> 01:37:08,242
...I am not.

1177
01:37:09,243 --> 01:37:14,039
It is merely the sunlight... It is very strong.

1178
01:37:22,423 --> 01:37:24,675
After three moles formed

1179
01:37:26,927 --> 01:37:31,265
on the forehead of Jinhui of the Seo Dynasty, he plotted a coup

1180
01:37:31,724 --> 01:37:33,267
and ascended to the throne...

1181
01:37:33,767 --> 01:37:37,771
His features also betray a strong lust for power.

1182
01:37:37,771 --> 01:37:41,275
There have been countless rumors about the actions of Grand Prince Suyang.

1183
01:37:41,275 --> 01:37:44,278
Since when was the Minister in charge of the palace guards?

1184
01:37:52,786 --> 01:37:53,787
You...

1185
01:37:55,789 --> 01:37:59,543
By whose orders are you by my side?

1186
01:37:59,543 --> 01:38:00,794
Your Majesty...

1187
01:38:01,545 --> 01:38:03,297
Tell me this instant!

1188
01:38:04,798 --> 01:38:08,844
By the orders of Grand Prince Suyang, Your Majesty.

1189
01:38:16,602 --> 01:38:19,104
I have been blind.

1190
01:38:19,104 --> 01:38:22,107
The court is full of Suyang's people.

1191
01:38:22,107 --> 01:38:25,000
Under the crime of bringing his people into the Royal Guard...

1192
01:38:25,000 --> 01:38:26,862
I will have my uncle banished.

1193
01:38:30,866 --> 01:38:34,870
From now on, none of you must allow any mistakes to happen.

1194
01:38:34,870 --> 01:38:38,874
Tomorrow, when Suyang sends his men to escort the Chinese ambassador...

1195
01:38:38,874 --> 01:38:42,127
When he is unguarded, we will strike then.

1196
01:38:42,878 --> 01:38:46,382
Currently Suyang is in charge of recepting the Chinese ambassador.

1197
01:38:46,382 --> 01:38:50,886
You must therefore take extra care so he will not hear of our plans.

1198
01:38:55,391 --> 01:38:57,643
Hyung! Hyung!

1199
01:38:57,893 --> 01:39:00,145
Did they say they'd promote you or anything?

1200
01:39:00,396 --> 01:39:03,399
Did they promise anything?

1201
01:39:06,151 --> 01:39:09,405
You didn't even bring it up, did you?

1202
01:39:09,405 --> 01:39:11,407
You didn't even...

1203
01:39:12,908 --> 01:39:16,161
I will find the right time, after everything has calmed down.

1204
01:39:16,662 --> 01:39:18,664
Jinhyung has many talents

1205
01:39:18,914 --> 01:39:22,418
so His Lordship will surely find somewhere to use him.

1206
01:39:22,418 --> 01:39:24,420
You should have brought it up before.

1207
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:28,674
You know people act different before and after they go to the bathroom.

1208
01:39:30,175 --> 01:39:31,677
Here it is?

1209
01:39:36,682 --> 01:39:38,934
Will it have some effect on the eyesight?

1210
01:39:38,934 --> 01:39:40,936
There are chrysanthemums on the hills.

1211
01:39:40,936 --> 01:39:43,522
It would have been better to make medicine out of them

1212
01:39:43,522 --> 01:39:47,276
but I can't go up there right now. My back hurts.

1213
01:39:47,276 --> 01:39:51,530
I used what we have right now. It'll still work well.

1214
01:39:52,531 --> 01:39:54,533
When is your back getting better, then?

1215
01:39:54,533 --> 01:39:57,536
In a few days, most likely.

1216
01:40:02,791 --> 01:40:05,543
What is this?

1217
01:40:07,796 --> 01:40:10,299
It is regarding an incident that happened some time ago.

1218
01:40:10,549 --> 01:40:13,051
You need not worry right now, my lord.

1219
01:40:13,051 --> 01:40:15,220
Tell me this instant!

1220
01:40:15,971 --> 01:40:20,726
Who was it that criticized Yellow Politics in front of the King?!

1221
01:40:27,774 --> 01:40:30,027
Mr. Kim from the Ministry of Justice left you this.

1222
01:40:34,281 --> 01:40:35,532
Here.

1223
01:40:42,789 --> 01:40:45,334
I'm proud of you for getting promoted so soon.

1224
01:40:45,584 --> 01:40:47,836
I bought you some medicine for your eyes, so take it.

1225
01:40:49,087 --> 01:40:51,340
How nice would it have been

1226
01:40:51,340 --> 01:40:54,843
if they'd chosen Jinhyung, huh?

1227
01:40:55,093 --> 01:40:58,347
It wouldn't have been worth it if others had noticed.

1228
01:40:59,598 --> 01:41:02,434
Let's hope the medicine works on him.

1229
01:41:02,935 --> 01:41:04,186
Where are you going?

1230
01:41:04,937 --> 01:41:08,690
To pick some chrysanthemums for the apothecary.

1231
01:41:09,691 --> 01:41:11,944
If they're good for the eyes, he should try them.

1232
01:41:11,944 --> 01:41:14,446
Let me come with you, if it's for Jinhyung!

1233
01:41:15,197 --> 01:41:16,448
No, it's alright.

1234
01:41:54,444 --> 01:41:56,446
Insolent bastard...

1235
01:41:56,947 --> 01:42:00,701
Just how qualified are you to blabber about Yellow Politics?

1236
01:42:00,701 --> 01:42:03,954
How dare you criticize Lord Kim Jongseo--!

1237
01:42:04,454 --> 01:42:07,207
If you can't see, you won't be able to speak either,

1238
01:42:07,457 --> 01:42:08,959
so shut up from now on.

1239
01:42:18,218 --> 01:42:19,469
Mr. Kim, where are you?

1240
01:42:20,721 --> 01:42:21,972
Mr. Kim!

1241
01:42:22,973 --> 01:42:24,725
Argh...

1242
01:42:25,225 --> 01:42:26,727
He's out right now...

1243
01:42:27,227 --> 01:42:28,478
Oh!

1244
01:42:28,979 --> 01:42:30,230
What is it?

1245
01:42:30,230 --> 01:42:33,734
An employee in the Ministry of Home Affairs got his eyes badly injured

1246
01:42:33,734 --> 01:42:35,485
and he's been asking for Mr. Kim.

1247
01:42:35,736 --> 01:42:37,988
An employee in the Ministry of Home Affairs...?

1248
01:42:39,239 --> 01:42:40,741
Do you mean Jinhyung?

1249
01:42:41,491 --> 01:42:44,244
Something's happened to Jinhyung's eyes?

1250
01:42:48,999 --> 01:42:52,252
The right eye's gone completely blind

1251
01:42:52,252 --> 01:42:55,005
and I'm not sure about the left.

1252
01:42:55,255 --> 01:42:56,506
You mean he'll lose his eyesight?

1253
01:42:57,007 --> 01:42:58,008
Apparently so...

1254
01:42:59,760 --> 01:43:01,011
Jinhyung!

1255
01:43:04,264 --> 01:43:06,266
What happened to you?

1256
01:43:07,267 --> 01:43:09,019
Uncle, Uncle.

1257
01:43:10,020 --> 01:43:12,522
Yes, it's your uncle, what happened?

1258
01:43:12,773 --> 01:43:14,274
Where is Father?

1259
01:43:14,775 --> 01:43:16,777
I want to see Father, Uncle.

1260
01:43:22,532 --> 01:43:26,036
Where are you, Father?

1261
01:43:26,036 --> 01:43:28,038
- Father!
- Get out of the way.

1262
01:43:28,538 --> 01:43:31,041
Jinhyung...

1263
01:43:33,793 --> 01:43:35,545
Please cure him...

1264
01:43:35,545 --> 01:43:36,296
Father!

1265
01:43:36,296 --> 01:43:38,798
You have to cure him!

1266
01:43:40,050 --> 01:43:42,302
Please, Jinhyung...

1267
01:43:43,053 --> 01:43:45,055
What on earth happened to him?

1268
01:43:45,555 --> 01:43:49,809
From what I heard, it was on Lord Kim Jongseo's orders.

1269
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:54,064
He heard about the Yellow Politics incident and was enraged.

1270
01:43:54,064 --> 01:43:57,317
Even so, I can't believe that the Minister would...

1271
01:43:57,317 --> 01:44:02,072
I heard the young man tell the physician that with my very own ears!

1272
01:44:02,072 --> 01:44:05,825
He said it was Kim Jongseo's lackeys that had made him like this.

1273
01:44:06,076 --> 01:44:10,830
And they're going to replace him with Kim Jongseo's grandson.

1274
01:44:13,083 --> 01:44:14,584
Jinhyung!

1275
01:44:16,086 --> 01:44:19,589
Tomorrow morning, before your father wakes up,

1276
01:44:19,589 --> 01:44:21,258
go to Hanyang.

1277
01:44:21,508 --> 01:44:22,509
Excuse me?

1278
01:44:23,260 --> 01:44:26,429
If you visit this merchant I know, he'll lend you his family name.

1279
01:44:26,429 --> 01:44:29,099
Use a new name, study hard,

1280
01:44:29,099 --> 01:44:31,810
and get yourself that government job you want.

1281
01:44:36,815 --> 01:44:40,068
You're going to become Prime Minster one day, you are.

1282
01:44:40,819 --> 01:44:41,903
Know what I mean?

1283
01:44:57,085 --> 01:44:58,999
Who is it?

1284
01:45:06,845 --> 01:45:10,348
I've come to meet Grand Prince Suyang.

1285
01:45:18,356 --> 01:45:19,607
My lord.

1286
01:45:20,608 --> 01:45:23,111
The brother-in-law of Kim Naekyung wishes to speak with you.

1287
01:45:39,377 --> 01:45:42,130
On what business are you here?

1288
01:45:43,631 --> 01:45:45,884
Don't send your soldiers away tomorrow.

1289
01:45:47,635 --> 01:45:48,887
Excuse me?

1290
01:45:49,637 --> 01:45:50,889
Tomorrow...

1291
01:45:51,139 --> 01:45:55,393
When the Chinese ambassador leaves, don't send your soldiers to escort him.

1292
01:45:55,894 --> 01:45:57,896
After you've sent away your men

1293
01:45:58,146 --> 01:46:01,649
Kim Jongseo will try to assassinate you.

1294
01:46:07,906 --> 01:46:10,909
Why tell me this now?

1295
01:46:11,409 --> 01:46:14,412
I heard that you made my brother-in-law a promise.

1296
01:46:15,663 --> 01:46:17,916
I beg you, please...

1297
01:46:20,168 --> 01:46:22,670
please keep that promise.

1298
01:46:23,171 --> 01:46:25,924
Please protect our family,

1299
01:46:25,924 --> 01:46:28,176
please grant my brother-in-law

1300
01:46:29,177 --> 01:46:31,679
and my nephew Jinhyung

1301
01:46:33,431 --> 01:46:36,434
places in the government...

1302
01:46:41,523 --> 01:46:44,275
This is the only thing I'm asking for.

1303
01:46:44,776 --> 01:46:49,489
Lord Suyang, Lord Suyang, please...

1304
01:46:55,537 --> 01:46:57,789
Please.

1305
01:47:01,167 --> 01:47:02,919
I promise.

1306
01:47:06,172 --> 01:47:07,924
I give you my word.

1307
01:47:37,453 --> 01:47:40,206
We would have been doomed if not for that brother-in-law.

1308
01:47:40,707 --> 01:47:44,210
How did you find out who the face reader's son was and blind him so?

1309
01:47:44,711 --> 01:47:47,964
I never expected the brother-in-law to take the bait.

1310
01:47:48,715 --> 01:47:51,467
I intended to fool Kim Naekyung himself...

1311
01:48:02,312 --> 01:48:07,317
What did you just say?

1312
01:48:10,820 --> 01:48:14,824
He said all we have to do is wait.

1313
01:48:15,575 --> 01:48:20,079
He said he would cure Jinhyung's eyes

1314
01:48:20,580 --> 01:48:22,707
and grant him a better government job, too.

1315
01:48:45,480 --> 01:48:46,731
You...

1316
01:48:50,735 --> 01:48:55,740
Stop dreaming!

1317
01:48:56,741 --> 01:48:58,242
Kim Jongseo...

1318
01:48:58,242 --> 01:49:02,497
doesn't give a damn about people like us!

1319
01:49:02,747 --> 01:49:04,749
He's putting his grandson

1320
01:49:04,749 --> 01:49:09,253
in the position Jinhyung used to have.

1321
01:49:23,017 --> 01:49:24,769
We're all dead now.

1322
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:29,774
If Kim Jongseo loses, we're all dead, you fool...

1323
01:49:50,962 --> 01:49:54,465
I must stop this. If I fail, the king is in danger, everyone is in danger...

1324
01:51:08,664 --> 01:51:09,915
My lord...

1325
01:51:16,422 --> 01:51:17,673
Minister Kim...

1326
01:51:19,425 --> 01:51:21,260
I see you're here.

1327
01:51:21,510 --> 01:51:25,765
There are important matters to discuss regarding our plans. Come with me.

1328
01:51:25,765 --> 01:51:27,266
Minister Kim.

1329
01:51:31,270 --> 01:51:32,772
You must hide.

1330
01:51:33,022 --> 01:51:36,776
Hide? What do you mean?

1331
01:51:36,776 --> 01:51:38,778
My lord!

1332
01:51:43,032 --> 01:51:45,785
I see you've been out, Minister.

1333
01:51:48,537 --> 01:51:50,790
What are you doing here at this hour?

1334
01:51:56,045 --> 01:51:59,799
I was passing by and dropped the cord attached to my hat

1335
01:52:00,383 --> 01:52:04,136
so I was wondering if you could lend me one of yours.

1336
01:52:04,387 --> 01:52:05,971
The hour is late.

1337
01:52:05,971 --> 01:52:09,809
How many people do you think will criticize you for forgetting your cord?

1338
01:52:09,809 --> 01:52:12,645
I have somewhere to go.

1339
01:52:12,645 --> 01:52:14,814
Nothing looks sillier than a man 

1340
01:52:14,814 --> 01:52:17,316
wearing a hat without a cord, does it?

1341
01:52:22,321 --> 01:52:23,864
Bring us a cord.

1342
01:52:44,385 --> 01:52:46,637
Whenever I see your face, my lord, 

1343
01:52:47,388 --> 01:52:51,142
I can tell you were meant to live seventy long years.

1344
01:52:54,145 --> 01:52:56,647
How old are you right now?

1345
01:53:01,402 --> 01:53:04,154
I am seventy this year.

1346
01:53:04,405 --> 01:53:09,159
I have a wish I would like to see come true this year.

1347
01:53:16,917 --> 01:53:19,420
What is this wish of yours?

1348
01:53:21,422 --> 01:53:23,424
I wish to become king.

1349
01:53:27,219 --> 01:53:29,722
Enough of your tricks!

1350
01:55:00,020 --> 01:55:02,773
Suyang, you bastard!

1351
01:55:03,774 --> 01:55:06,527
How dare you...

1352
01:55:43,897 --> 01:55:45,149
My lord!

1353
01:55:49,153 --> 01:55:52,156
The tiger hunt is over.

1354
01:56:02,124 --> 01:56:08,130
Suyang killed Kim Jongseo!

1355
01:56:08,630 --> 01:56:11,383
Suyang killed Kim Jongseo!

1356
01:56:12,134 --> 01:56:13,385
Suyang...

1357
01:56:15,637 --> 01:56:16,638
Suyang...

1358
01:56:17,389 --> 01:56:21,143
Suyang killed Kim Jongseo.

1359
01:56:22,394 --> 01:56:25,397
You must send your troops at once

1360
01:56:25,397 --> 01:56:27,399
and arrest Suyang.

1361
01:56:27,649 --> 01:56:31,904
You must act in haste, or we will be unable to prevent a coup.

1362
01:56:31,904 --> 01:56:35,157
Who has told you this? Who are you?

1363
01:56:38,493 --> 01:56:40,495
Oh, I know who you are.

1364
01:56:40,746 --> 01:56:44,625
The physiognomer who knows everything about someone just from a look at their face.

1365
01:56:48,378 --> 01:56:52,841
Kim Naekyung, the face reader. How have you been?

1366
01:56:54,927 --> 01:56:56,178
Han Myunghoi.

1367
01:56:59,097 --> 01:57:00,557
You bastards...

1368
01:57:03,393 --> 01:57:05,145
You did it, in the end...

1369
01:57:05,646 --> 01:57:07,839
Thanks in no small part to you.

1370
01:57:12,235 --> 01:57:14,237
You traitors!

1371
01:57:14,488 --> 01:57:16,740
You'll get punished by God.

1372
01:57:16,990 --> 01:57:19,284
You'll fall into the pits of hell!

1373
01:57:20,369 --> 01:57:23,163
I'll show you what hell really is.

1374
01:57:27,751 --> 01:57:31,505
Prime Minister Hwangbo In!

1375
01:57:32,506 --> 01:57:33,507
Who...?

1376
01:57:33,507 --> 01:57:36,859
You've lived a very long and fruitful life, Prime Minister.

1377
01:58:14,923 --> 01:58:18,343
You had ordered to have me banished?

1378
01:58:19,845 --> 01:58:21,388
Had you succeeded

1379
01:58:21,888 --> 01:58:24,391
I would have lost my head.

1380
01:58:25,183 --> 01:58:27,769
Such is the game of politics.

1381
01:58:28,353 --> 01:58:30,105
Either I die...

1382
01:58:31,440 --> 01:58:34,109
or my enemy dies.

1383
01:58:35,610 --> 01:58:37,612
The three Ministers

1384
01:58:37,863 --> 01:58:41,324
have been executed as punishment for violating the rights of the King.

1385
01:58:41,783 --> 01:58:46,288
Therefore I will assume the position of Prime Minister, the Minister of Civil Appointments, 

1386
01:58:46,788 --> 01:58:48,039
the Minister of War,

1387
01:58:48,290 --> 01:58:52,294
and the head of the Military, in order to assist the King.

1388
01:58:52,294 --> 01:58:56,047
If you will stand with me,

1389
01:58:57,048 --> 01:58:59,301
stand to this side.

1390
01:58:59,801 --> 01:59:01,553
If you will not,

1391
01:59:02,053 --> 01:59:04,556
you will most certainly die.

1392
01:59:23,950 --> 01:59:25,577
At this moment

1393
01:59:26,077 --> 01:59:30,832
nobody can undo this atrocity.

1394
01:59:31,583 --> 01:59:35,420
Yet, I plead you, you must become a wise ruler

1395
01:59:35,420 --> 01:59:39,758
so that the people will not suffer...

1396
02:00:28,390 --> 02:00:30,892
I must report to the King that we have

1397
02:00:31,142 --> 02:00:33,895
taken care of all who violated his authority.

1398
02:00:33,895 --> 02:00:36,147
You may now leave.

1399
02:00:43,738 --> 02:00:46,991
Grand Prince Suyang killed Kim Jongseo!

1400
02:00:47,242 --> 02:00:50,036
The world is changing!

1401
02:00:50,537 --> 02:00:55,291
He's going to behead everyone who doesn't listen to him.

1402
02:00:55,542 --> 02:00:58,044
Government employees are being dragged out of the palace right now!

1403
02:01:02,549 --> 02:01:04,050
Jinhyung...

1404
02:01:06,052 --> 02:01:10,807
These traitors who did not follow the orders of Grand Prince Suyang

1405
02:01:11,307 --> 02:01:13,059
will all be beheaded!

1406
02:01:13,810 --> 02:01:15,061
Hurry.

1407
02:01:20,567 --> 02:01:21,818
Jinhyung!

1408
02:01:23,820 --> 02:01:26,072
Jinhyung! Jinhyung!

1409
02:01:27,073 --> 02:01:27,824
Jinhyung!

1410
02:01:28,074 --> 02:01:28,825
- Stand aside!
- Father!

1411
02:01:29,075 --> 02:01:31,077
Jinhyung! It's your father!

1412
02:01:31,327 --> 02:01:33,079
I'm here! I'm here!

1413
02:01:33,329 --> 02:01:34,831
Jinhyung!

1414
02:01:35,081 --> 02:01:38,334
Hyung!

1415
02:01:38,835 --> 02:01:40,336
Jinhyung!

1416
02:01:40,587 --> 02:01:42,338
Jinhyung!

1417
02:01:43,339 --> 02:01:45,091
Jinhyung!

1418
02:01:47,594 --> 02:01:48,845
Jinhyung!

1419
02:01:51,598 --> 02:01:53,099
Your Majesty!

1420
02:01:53,349 --> 02:01:56,102
Your Majesty! Lord Suyang...

1421
02:01:56,352 --> 02:01:58,354
Lord Suyang.

1422
02:01:59,355 --> 02:02:01,858
Lord Suyang! Lord Suyang...

1423
02:02:02,358 --> 02:02:04,110
Please spare his life.

1424
02:02:04,611 --> 02:02:07,113
My son is there. Please spare his life...

1425
02:02:09,115 --> 02:02:10,867
Where is your son?

1426
02:02:11,117 --> 02:02:13,620
That boy, there, being dragged away, is my son.

1427
02:02:13,870 --> 02:02:15,371
He's just an immature boy.

1428
02:02:15,622 --> 02:02:17,624
Please spare his life, Your Majesty...

1429
02:02:24,130 --> 02:02:26,132
Jinhyung, Jinhyung...

1430
02:02:26,382 --> 02:02:28,134
- Are you alright?
- Father?

1431
02:02:28,384 --> 02:02:30,637
Don't worry, Jinhyung... Don't worry.

1432
02:02:31,638 --> 02:02:33,890
Jinhyung!

1433
02:02:35,200 --> 02:02:37,644
Is this your son?

1434
02:02:38,000 --> 02:02:40,647
Y-Yes, it is.

1435
02:02:40,647 --> 02:02:43,149
I hear he didn't take my side.

1436
02:02:43,149 --> 02:02:45,401
He's still a boy, who doesn't know anything.

1437
02:02:45,401 --> 02:02:47,403
He's just a young boy.

1438
02:02:47,500 --> 02:02:50,406
In exchange for pardoning your son...

1439
02:02:51,680 --> 02:02:55,411
Would you be willing to let me pluck your eyes out?

1440
02:02:56,500 --> 02:02:58,414
Do it! Please,

1441
02:02:58,414 --> 02:03:00,917
pluck them out.

1442
02:03:00,917 --> 02:03:03,670
Father. Father, no! You can't!

1443
02:03:04,671 --> 02:03:05,672
Father!

1444
02:03:05,672 --> 02:03:06,422
Did you hear that?

1445
02:03:06,422 --> 02:03:09,175
Pluck out the eyes of that insolent man and bring them to me.

1446
02:03:11,177 --> 02:03:12,428
Father, no!

1447
02:03:49,000 --> 02:03:50,299
Forget it.

1448
02:03:50,550 --> 02:03:53,803
What on earth would I do with your eyeballs?

1449
02:04:08,067 --> 02:04:12,572
Instead, would you read my face for me?

1450
02:04:21,330 --> 02:04:25,084
What do you think? Will I become king?

1451
02:04:27,086 --> 02:04:29,338
Still unable to answer?

1452
02:04:31,591 --> 02:04:32,842
No, Your Majesty.

1453
02:04:33,593 --> 02:04:35,094
No.

1454
02:04:36,596 --> 02:04:40,099
You will become king, Grand Prince.

1455
02:04:41,601 --> 02:04:43,352
You will become a wise king

1456
02:04:43,603 --> 02:04:46,105
and make Joseon rich and powerful.

1457
02:04:46,856 --> 02:04:52,000
You will become a great king, praised by generations to come, Your Majesty!

1458
02:04:51,861 --> 02:04:53,112


1459
02:04:54,864 --> 02:04:56,866
Your Majesty!

1460
02:04:57,366 --> 02:04:59,869
Your Majesty...

1461
02:05:02,872 --> 02:05:06,375
Good. Hearing that has made me feel much better indeed.

1462
02:05:08,878 --> 02:05:10,630
I find myself tired. Let us stop here.

1463
02:05:11,631 --> 02:05:13,633
Go back home now.

1464
02:05:18,137 --> 02:05:20,389
Father.

1465
02:05:21,140 --> 02:05:23,893
I'm fine, Jinhyung. It's fine.

1466
02:05:29,148 --> 02:05:30,399
It's all over now.

1467
02:05:30,900 --> 02:05:32,902
Jinhyung.

1468
02:05:33,402 --> 02:05:35,404
Let's go back home, Jinhyung.

1469
02:05:36,155 --> 02:05:38,658
Let's go back to the countryside.

1470
02:05:40,409 --> 02:05:42,161
Wait, face reader.

1471
02:05:46,415 --> 02:05:49,669
The longer I think about it, the stranger your words feel.

1472
02:05:49,669 --> 02:05:53,172
You said I will become king, but I already am king.

1473
02:05:53,923 --> 02:05:55,675
And you call yourself a fortune teller?

1474
02:05:55,925 --> 02:05:58,928
You should have said it before I became king.

1475
02:05:59,178 --> 02:06:01,681
Now, anyone can say what you just said.

1476
02:06:04,183 --> 02:06:08,187
You did read my face nevertheless, so let me pay the price.

1477
02:07:15,504 --> 02:07:19,008
Jinhyung.

1478
02:07:23,512 --> 02:07:24,764
Jinhyung!

1479
02:07:26,015 --> 02:07:28,267
Jinhyung!

1480
02:07:33,522 --> 02:07:37,777
Open your eyes... No, Jinhyung, you can't...

1481
02:07:39,028 --> 02:07:41,530
Father... Save me...

1482
02:07:42,782 --> 02:07:45,534
- Father, save me...
- Jinhyung...

1483
02:07:47,787 --> 02:07:51,040
Save me...

1484
02:07:55,795 --> 02:07:58,047
Truly you deserve to die

1485
02:07:59,048 --> 02:08:02,051
but I am sparing your life because of everything you've done for me.

1486
02:08:07,056 --> 02:08:12,311
Suyang, you bastard! You bastard!

1487
02:08:15,064 --> 02:08:17,817
Suyang, you bastard...

1488
02:08:35,584 --> 02:08:37,336
Jinhyung...

1489
02:09:22,131 --> 02:09:25,884
I wonder if he was aware that his son would 

1490
02:09:26,135 --> 02:09:28,387
die such an untimely death?

1491
02:09:31,140 --> 02:09:33,392
I wasn't aware, myself...

1492
02:10:12,598 --> 02:10:14,350
How have you been?

1493
02:10:17,102 --> 02:10:22,608
I thought that fellow used to be talkative?

1494
02:10:23,358 --> 02:10:25,360
After the incident,

1495
02:10:25,861 --> 02:10:29,865
he tried to cut off his Adam's apple and ended up losing his voice.

1496
02:10:40,375 --> 02:10:42,377
I didn't want to bring him here either.

1497
02:10:43,128 --> 02:10:44,880
But what power do I have?

1498
02:10:51,637 --> 02:10:53,388
How dare you? Do you know who you're--

1499
02:11:13,325 --> 02:11:18,080
How idyllic. I like that you can smell the sea from here.

1500
02:11:18,831 --> 02:11:22,835
Yet this place strikes me as somewhere old men should retire to

1501
02:11:23,335 --> 02:11:25,838
only after they've embraced the world.

1502
02:11:27,589 --> 02:11:30,092
It's a waste that someone like you

1503
02:11:30,843 --> 02:11:32,594
is whiling his time away here.

1504
02:11:37,599 --> 02:11:40,853
You must have seen the faces of every man who stood with us.

1505
02:11:42,104 --> 02:11:43,856
Have you recorded them yet?

1506
02:11:46,608 --> 02:11:48,360
You should do it.

1507
02:11:49,611 --> 02:11:53,115
If you write down the characteristics of men who enjoy rebelling,

1508
02:11:53,615 --> 02:11:57,160
wouldn't it prove useful in preparing for any future unfortunate happenings?

1509
02:11:57,661 --> 02:12:02,165
Do you believe there was anything special about your faces that day?

1510
02:12:02,916 --> 02:12:05,419
There were men with the faces of crooks,

1511
02:12:07,170 --> 02:12:10,674
men with the faces of bloodthirsty butchers,

1512
02:12:12,676 --> 02:12:15,178
men with the faces of scholars...

1513
02:12:15,679 --> 02:12:18,181
They were all faces you could see anywhere.

1514
02:12:18,682 --> 02:12:21,685
- If so...
- It's merely that...

1515
02:12:21,935 --> 02:12:24,438
Suyang was meant to become king.

1516
02:12:24,938 --> 02:12:26,189
What do you mean?

1517
02:12:27,941 --> 02:12:32,446
I only read people's faces. I was unable to read the changing times.

1518
02:12:33,196 --> 02:12:36,199
It was as if I only saw the ever-changing waves

1519
02:12:37,701 --> 02:12:39,703
instead of seeing the wind

1520
02:12:40,954 --> 02:12:43,957
when it is the wind that shapes the waves.

1521
02:12:46,710 --> 02:12:51,965
Isn't what you're saying that nobody would have been able to prevent our coup?

1522
02:12:52,799 --> 02:12:55,302
All you did was simply ride the highest wave for a moment

1523
02:12:55,802 --> 02:12:58,347
while we were being swept away at the lowest point.

1524
02:12:59,348 --> 02:13:01,350
One day, what was low will become high again.

1525
02:13:04,102 --> 02:13:07,105
The same way that even the highest wave will crash back down into the sea.

1526
02:13:07,856 --> 02:13:09,107
Are you cursing us?

1527
02:13:16,156 --> 02:13:18,408
This is the first time I've seen your face properly.

1528
02:13:24,456 --> 02:13:25,957
You have a strange visage.

1529
02:13:26,208 --> 02:13:29,211
Vulgar but at the same time noble...

1530
02:13:30,462 --> 02:13:32,964
And yet... Your end won't be pleasant.

1531
02:13:34,716 --> 02:13:40,222
Your fate is to have your head cut off.

1532
02:14:01,159 --> 02:14:03,411
Time passes altogether too fast.

1533
02:14:04,913 --> 02:14:07,415
Everything feels like it came to pass just yesterday.

1534
02:14:08,667 --> 02:14:11,920
I'm already an old man.

1535
02:14:13,380 --> 02:14:17,801
After I heard what the face reader said, 

1536
02:14:18,260 --> 02:14:21,721
I lived the rest of my life in constant caution.

1537
02:14:22,139 --> 02:14:24,558
To make as few enemies as possible.

1538
02:14:25,517 --> 02:14:27,519
Perhaps that is why...

1539
02:14:28,979 --> 02:14:32,941
Suyang has already been dead twenty years

1540
02:14:33,775 --> 02:14:37,529
and I have served four different kings.

1541
02:14:40,532 --> 02:14:42,784
You were right.

1542
02:14:43,869 --> 02:14:48,832
Face reading is nothing but a superstition.

1543
02:14:49,791 --> 02:14:54,254
I was not beheaded.

1544
02:14:57,215 --> 02:15:00,218
He was wrong.

1545
02:15:18,820 --> 02:15:25,327
14 years after being crowned king, Grand Prince Suyang atoned for his sins and turned to Buddhism, suffering from terrible illness and guilt.

1546
02:15:25,327 --> 02:15:31,082
He pardoned several hundred people who he had banished or forced into slavery during his coup, and died a sudden death a few days later.

1547
02:15:31,583 --> 02:15:37,339
17 years after his death, Han Myunghoi was said to have been involved in the killing of King Yeonsangun's mother, Queen Yoon, 

1548
02:15:38,089 --> 02:15:44,095
and he was dug up and posthumously beheaded.

1549
02:15:52,604 --> 02:15:55,105
What are you looking at so?

1550
02:15:56,858 --> 02:15:58,860
I am looking at the world.

1551
02:16:01,363 --> 02:16:02,739
What's it like?

1552
02:16:02,989 --> 02:16:04,741
Looking at the world.

1553
