MRS. OBREE: It's happened again.

17
00:03:46,259 --> 00:03:48,845
MR. OBREE: Oh, I don't believe it,
not again. This has got to stop.

18
00:03:48,915 --> 00:03:51,731
Get him downstairs now,
I want to talk to him.

19
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,110
I understand you were in a bit
of bother again today, young man.

20
00:04:08,312 --> 00:04:10,734
You're still not prepared
to give me any names?

21
00:04:15,097 --> 00:04:17,519
You're just gonna have to learn
to stand up to them.

22
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:26,736
This should keep you out of trouble.

23
00:04:26,811 --> 00:04:29,178
This is your Christmas
from your Dad and me.

24
00:04:29,243 --> 00:04:32,179
Maybe it'll make up for... You know.

25
00:04:33,948 --> 00:04:35,475
Merry Christmas, son.

26
00:04:36,445 --> 00:04:39,064
Graeme!

27
00:04:39,134 --> 00:04:40,563
Graeme!

28
00:04:42,367 --> 00:04:43,993
Now I'm going to get to you.

29
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:17,119
So, if you just take the lift
behind you up to the third floor...

30
00:05:17,190 --> 00:05:18,237
Thank you.

31
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:28,545
How's that for service?
Six minutes from Dobbie's Loan.

32
00:05:28,616 --> 00:05:33,057
Then it'll only be 12 minutes
before you're back with the right one.

33
00:05:38,633 --> 00:05:40,674
Hi, there. How can I help you?

34
00:05:46,475 --> 00:05:47,621
Hey!

35
00:05:49,484 --> 00:05:52,234
Dispatch give you the wrong parcel?

36
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:56,131
Okay, so what you do is,
you wait for her to go off on her lunch,

37
00:05:56,206 --> 00:05:57,286
then you nip back in,

38
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:59,911
get them to sign for it
before you hand it over,

39
00:05:59,982 --> 00:06:02,950
then dispatch can sort out their own mess.

40
00:06:03,023 --> 00:06:05,445
- I'm Malky McGovern.
- Graeme Obree.

41
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:08,967
Yeah, I know who you are.
I'm a big cycling fan.

42
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:53,717
Come on, Graeme!

43
00:06:57,498 --> 00:06:59,637
Well done, Graeme!

44
00:07:08,444 --> 00:07:11,379
Look, there's Daddy.

45
00:07:12,157 --> 00:07:14,099
We just got here a minute ago.

46
00:07:15,229 --> 00:07:17,139
I'll put the kettle on.

(THUNDER RUMBLING)

48
00:08:01,798 --> 00:08:03,587
Don't let him rip you off.

49
00:08:29,612 --> 00:08:31,042
Make it 300, you got a deal.

50
00:08:31,116 --> 00:08:33,004
MAN: Look, son, you've gone bust.

51
00:08:33,069 --> 00:08:35,939
Maker your mind up,
it's either 200 or nothing.

52
00:08:36,013 --> 00:08:37,836
Okay, 200 it is.

53
00:08:37,902 --> 00:08:40,172
I'm sorry,
you're better off going up the road.

54
00:08:40,239 --> 00:08:42,661
Oh, not with this antique.

55
00:08:42,735 --> 00:08:45,964
Aye, right. What can I do for you?

56
00:08:46,032 --> 00:08:49,480
Well, I need a new...

57
00:08:49,552 --> 00:08:51,210
An old crank.

58
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,998
I don't think so, but let's see.

59
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,148
Oh, aye. Once upon a time, eh?

60
00:09:08,212 --> 00:09:10,351
I'm afraid I don't follow cycling.

61
00:09:12,149 --> 00:09:14,320
I heard of him, though.

62
00:09:14,389 --> 00:09:16,528
Boardman. He's good, isn't he?

63
00:09:16,598 --> 00:09:19,729
Aye, well, he was always the man to beat.
And still is, the bugger.

64
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:20,976
Right.

65
00:09:25,176 --> 00:09:30,196
These young boys, full of bright ideas,
but they cannae stand the pace.

66
00:09:31,257 --> 00:09:33,079
You mind if I deliver that one myself?

67
00:09:33,145 --> 00:09:35,284
Haven't got time, son.
I've got a buyer coming to the yard.

68
00:09:35,353 --> 00:09:37,623
That's okay, be there before you.

69
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,414
Are you trying to be funny?

70
00:09:39,482 --> 00:09:43,094
Tell you what, you get there before me
you can keep the 200,

71
00:09:43,164 --> 00:09:46,198
I get there before you,
I get the other hundred I wanted.

72
00:09:46,268 --> 00:09:48,886
This gentleman here can hold the cash.

73
00:09:48,956 --> 00:09:50,517
If you've no objection.

74
00:10:40,615 --> 00:10:41,564
(CAR HORNS HONKING)

75
00:10:49,161 --> 00:10:50,688
He's done.

76
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,984
Maybe not.

77
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:57,224
The little...

78
00:11:07,116 --> 00:11:09,004
Oh, come on.

79
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:11,971
- I'm fine.
- That was mad.

80
00:11:12,045 --> 00:11:13,639
It's been said before.

81
00:11:14,574 --> 00:11:16,843
Well, it's gonna cost 300 to repair the van.

82
00:11:16,911 --> 00:11:19,562
- You could have killed him, man!
- It's all right.

83
00:11:19,631 --> 00:11:21,541
I would have won anyway
if he hadn't have cheated.

84
00:11:21,615 --> 00:11:23,437
You weren't perfect yourself, son.

85
00:11:23,503 --> 00:11:26,155
Anyway, have to grab your chance.

86
00:11:26,224 --> 00:11:27,948
And trust to the Lord.

87
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:31,500
When it comes to religion,
Karl Marx got it right.

88
00:11:31,570 --> 00:11:34,887
I'll find a crank for you.
Drop by sometime next week.

89
00:11:34,961 --> 00:11:36,904
We're in the flat above the shop.

90
00:11:36,978 --> 00:11:39,400
- Mr...
- Baxter. Douglas Baxter.

91
00:11:46,292 --> 00:11:49,042
All right, Chris?

92
00:11:50,325 --> 00:11:52,659
So, what are you doing with this lot?

93
00:11:52,726 --> 00:11:55,377
Putting food on the table
and paying the odd bill.

94
00:11:55,446 --> 00:11:58,927
But you're famous.
You still hold the British one-hour record.

95
00:11:58,999 --> 00:12:01,487
But I gotta make a living
like everybody else.

96
00:12:01,559 --> 00:12:03,152
Have a sandwich.

97
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:05,005
Cheers.

98
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:06,964
But all the same.

99
00:12:09,657 --> 00:12:12,113
Oh, Jesus, what have you got in this?

100
00:12:12,186 --> 00:12:13,298
Is that marmalade?

101
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:15,060
Enough sugar to keep you going all day.

102
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,887
Aye, but it tastes horrible.

103
00:12:16,954 --> 00:12:19,988
Couple of these for breakfast,
I'm up the road in no time.

104
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:21,620
That's 30 miles away.

105
00:12:21,692 --> 00:12:23,219
Thirty-two and a half.

106
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,643
And if you're not gonna eat that,
I'll have it back.

107
00:12:41,183 --> 00:12:43,071
What about Chris Boardman, then?

108
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:46,103
He's going for the world one-hour
later this year.

109
00:12:46,176 --> 00:12:50,781
But then again, that record hasn't
stood for nine years for nothing, has it?

110
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:55,544
You've been head to head
a few times with Boardman, haven't you?

111
00:12:55,618 --> 00:12:58,073
You think he can do it?

112
00:12:58,146 --> 00:13:00,187
If anyone can do it, God can.

113
00:13:01,187 --> 00:13:03,359
Right, time's up.

114
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:05,826
Fair enough.

115
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,080
What's the problem?

116
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:23,974
On you go, I'll catch you up.

117
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,429
Is something wrong?
I can fix it, I'm good at that stuff.

118
00:13:26,504 --> 00:13:29,188
No, there's no problem. Just got an idea.

119
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:35,137
On you go!
You're wasting a good head start.

120
00:13:55,087 --> 00:13:57,258
What the hell have you done?

121
00:14:28,341 --> 00:14:31,506
Been out with Graeme, I see. He's inside.

122
00:14:31,574 --> 00:14:33,811
Do you want fish and chips?

123
00:14:33,878 --> 00:14:36,180
- And a pickle.
- This is Katie.

124
00:14:36,246 --> 00:14:37,195
Hiya.

125
00:14:41,624 --> 00:14:43,118
What do you think?

126
00:14:43,192 --> 00:14:45,560
Yeah, definitely got something.

127
00:14:46,329 --> 00:14:47,638
Look at him.

128
00:15:00,795 --> 00:15:02,170
Is that her bike?

129
00:15:03,452 --> 00:15:07,031
Oh, no, she just borrows it off her granny
at the weekends.

130
00:15:08,189 --> 00:15:09,815
Where are we off to now?

131
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:24,379
- GRAEME: You got that tube?
- Yeah, yeah, got it.

132
00:15:27,841 --> 00:15:31,005
See, I told you it would be okay.

133
00:15:31,073 --> 00:15:33,757
So, Katie's a biker, eh?

134
00:15:33,826 --> 00:15:36,576
I suppose she's got tattoos
and all that stuff?

135
00:15:36,643 --> 00:15:38,977
Bikers are into that kind of thing,
aren't they?

136
00:15:39,044 --> 00:15:42,393
Then again, I suppose she's got
a Hells Angel for a boyfriend.

137
00:15:55,878 --> 00:15:57,253
Who's is it?

138
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:00,996
(BANGING ON DOOR)

139
00:16:07,145 --> 00:16:11,816
I just dropped by and I was wondering
if you'd found that new crank for me?

140
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:13,955
One second.

141
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,225
(BANGING ON DOOR)

142
00:16:19,947 --> 00:16:24,258
And you dropped a few bits and pieces
when you took off like that.

143
00:16:24,332 --> 00:16:26,634
- It's for a new bike I'm building.
- They were throwing that out anyway.

144
00:16:26,701 --> 00:16:28,490
- It's really not stealing...
- That'll have been in the dump...

145
00:16:28,557 --> 00:16:29,867
...just bits and pieces...
...in a few days and

146
00:16:29,934 --> 00:16:31,341
- we're in a hurry because Graeme's...
...and rubbish

147
00:16:31,405 --> 00:16:32,867
- that they couldn't sell.
...got a new idea.

148
00:16:33,998 --> 00:16:36,682
- Who's this?
- It's Malky.

149
00:16:36,783 --> 00:16:38,856
Malky McGovern.

150
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,935
What new bike?

151
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,626
Why do skiers crouch like this?

152
00:16:43,696 --> 00:16:44,973
Better aerodynamics.

153
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:48,457
Exactly. So why not for cycling, too?

154
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,278
I tried reversing the handlebars

155
00:16:51,346 --> 00:16:54,380
but after about 20 miles or so
I realized it's not enough.

156
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,043
Gotta go the whole way, build a new bike.

157
00:16:56,115 --> 00:16:59,083
Forget all the rules, start from scratch.

158
00:16:59,155 --> 00:17:01,130
But to what end?

159
00:17:01,204 --> 00:17:03,692
Break the world one-hour record.

160
00:17:03,764 --> 00:17:05,106
Which stands at?

161
00:17:05,172 --> 00:17:08,272
Fifty-one and a bit kilometers.
It's thirty-two miles, more or less.

162
00:17:08,342 --> 00:17:12,052
Well, nobody can accuse you
of thinking small.

163
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:15,861
But hold it, hold it,
before we all get carried away here.

164
00:17:15,926 --> 00:17:19,123
Even if you could do it,
this kind of thing takes lots of money.

165
00:17:19,192 --> 00:17:21,429
First, there's the money to build the bike.

166
00:17:21,496 --> 00:17:23,503
Then you need to find
a world-standard velodrome

167
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:26,162
which we don't have around here
and pay for that.

168
00:17:26,233 --> 00:17:27,957
Including all the time keepers
and all that...

169
00:17:28,025 --> 00:17:30,579
Okay, you got the job.

170
00:17:30,650 --> 00:17:31,860
What job?

171
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:36,088
Well, Anne used to be my manager before,
but she's got enough on her plate as it is.

172
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,878
You can take over.

173
00:17:37,948 --> 00:17:41,297
Where do you plan to build this bike?

174
00:17:41,372 --> 00:17:43,958
Well, I hadn't got that far yet but...

175
00:18:14,627 --> 00:18:17,016
I do have a tendency to hoard.

176
00:18:17,091 --> 00:18:20,986

177
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:22,654

To a new world record.

180
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:33,536
To a new world record.
Eight weeks from now.

181
00:18:33,606 --> 00:18:36,869
Oh, wait a minute.
What do you mean eight weeks from now?

182
00:18:36,936 --> 00:18:38,791
Your man Boardman's
going for it in nine weeks.

183
00:18:38,856 --> 00:18:42,053
Well, then, let's do it in eight.

184
00:19:06,989 --> 00:19:09,925
- Morning.
- How are you doing?

185
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:11,459
You tell me.

186
00:19:11,534 --> 00:19:13,323
Aye, that's what I'm after.

187
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,141
I'll leave it in the shed for you.

188
00:19:19,184 --> 00:19:21,290
I didn't know you were into hi-tech.

189
00:19:22,065 --> 00:19:26,092
Make do and mend.
That's the Obree approach.

190
00:19:26,161 --> 00:19:29,806
It must be a killer.
Going at that rate for an hour.

191
00:19:29,874 --> 00:19:31,565
Killer's not the word for it.

192
00:19:31,634 --> 00:19:35,148
Francesco Moser set the record,
it stood for nine years.

193
00:19:35,219 --> 00:19:39,475
Eddy Merckx held it before Moser,
said it burned three years off his life.

194
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:42,191
Merckx swore he'd never go through
that kind of torture again.

195
00:19:42,261 --> 00:19:44,148
And he was the greatest cyclist ever.

196
00:19:44,213 --> 00:19:47,509
He won the Tour de France five times.

197
00:19:47,574 --> 00:19:52,790
Before him there was Archambaud,
Baldini and Coppi and Anquetil.

Okay, fine.

The PR Manager's running a bit late,
his secretary says,

202
00:21:02,021 --> 00:21:03,777
so if you could just wait a few minutes.

203
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:05,307
No problem.

205
00:21:11,846 --> 00:21:15,808
- No, I don't think so.
- Yeah, I'm sure I've seen you.

00:21:15,879 --> 00:21:19,076
- Thanks.
- Usual routine, darling.

- Okay.
- Cheers.

- Malky, my man. You here for a job?
- No.

You were in here last week.

a personal management company,

211

213

We'll just leave it.

214
00:21:48,078 --> 00:21:49,420
Is it about Malky taking over?

215
00:21:49,486 --> 00:21:52,716
No, I'm delighted about Malky taking over.

216
00:21:55,663 --> 00:21:59,439
I know we need the money.
I know I've got to keep on at the hospital.

217

Are you sure this is the right thing to do?

218

219
00:22:07,602 --> 00:22:09,642
Sure, why not?

There must be more to it than that.

229
00:22:46,778 --> 00:22:48,404

237
00:23:24,578 --> 00:23:27,480
Well, how much have you got so far?

238
00:23:27,554 --> 00:23:31,778
To be honest,
wouldn't pay for these coffees.

240
00:23:37,572 --> 00:23:40,191
- Tell him that Katie sent you.
- Who is he?

It might appeal to him.

go out and get a drink sometime.

A drink?

00:24:04,298 --> 00:24:06,884
Did you think I'd show you my tattoos
if you bought me a drink?

Why would you want to sponsor Graeme?

283
00:27:33,139 --> 00:27:37,068
Well, because he's pretty special, really.

284

I mean, for a Scotsman, that is.

285
00:27:40,309 --> 00:27:44,783
And, cycling could be
a lot more popular if he wins...

286
00:27:46,294 --> 00:27:47,920
That's about it, really.

being held by a Scotsman.

349
00:32:32,624 --> 00:32:34,534
The bike that Boardman's going on

350
00:32:34,609 --> 00:32:38,406
cost half a million to develop
and it was designed by a computer.

351
00:32:38,481 --> 00:32:41,548
So how the hell is that thing

352
00:32:41,618 --> 00:32:43,953
that's made out of scrap
and washing machine parts

353
00:32:44,019 --> 00:32:46,703
going to break a record
that's stood since...

354
00:32:46,771 --> 00:32:48,746
Well, since before they were born?

355
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,413
BOY: What's that for, big man? The circus?

356
00:32:50,484 --> 00:32:53,714
Aye. Aye, that's right, son.

357
00:32:53,781 --> 00:32:55,275
You get one thing straight, Malky.

358
00:32:55,349 --> 00:32:57,106
I know what I'm doing here.

359
00:32:57,173 --> 00:32:58,995
Maybe it doesn't look like it,

360
00:32:59,062 --> 00:33:01,037
but this bike's been built
according to the laws of physics.

361
00:33:01,111 --> 00:33:04,013
There's a scientific reason
for every single bit of design.

362
00:33:04,087 --> 00:33:06,509
And that's how I'm gonna break the record
with or without you.

363
00:33:06,583 --> 00:33:08,307
Graeme, he's trying to help you, that's all.

364
00:33:08,376 --> 00:33:10,580
Well, I don't need his help.

365
00:33:10,648 --> 00:33:12,274
I can do this on my own.

366
00:33:41,374 --> 00:33:44,921
DOUGLAS: Lord, Savior, Holy Spirit.

367
00:33:44,991 --> 00:33:48,821
Upon us, and upon this world.

368
00:33:50,272 --> 00:33:55,576
We ask you to bless Jonathan
and to keep him within your sight,

369
00:33:55,649 --> 00:33:58,846
as he grows into manhood.

370
00:33:58,914 --> 00:34:02,974
And though we cannot ask you
to keep him from all harm in this world,

371
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:04,832
still we hope,

372
00:34:05,699 --> 00:34:09,311
that you will stay by his side
in difficult times.

373
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,585
And give him the strength

374
00:34:11,653 --> 00:34:14,588
to rise from despair

375
00:34:15,173 --> 00:34:17,345
and self-doubt.

376
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:21,339
Jonathan, I baptize thee

377
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:26,499
in the name of the Father and of the Son
and of the Holy Ghost.

378
00:34:26,568 --> 00:34:27,516
Amen.

379
00:34:29,768 --> 00:34:32,354
You've done a good job, Malky.

380
00:34:32,425 --> 00:34:35,873
Couldn't have done it
without phoning you twice a day.

381
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:38,945
And the tickets.

382
00:34:44,363 --> 00:34:46,916
- This one's for me, I'm not coming.
- Yes you are.

383
00:34:46,987 --> 00:34:50,435
Katie says you and Graeme are a team
and that's good enough for me.

384
00:34:50,508 --> 00:34:52,483
There isn't enough money
for the three of us to go to Norway.

385
00:34:52,556 --> 00:34:54,728
Yeah, well, I'm paying for myself.

386
00:34:56,557 --> 00:34:59,307
Malky I really appreciate it,
but I've got no one to mind Ewan.

387
00:34:59,374 --> 00:35:03,782
Katie's gonna take some time off.
She'll look after him. It's all sorted.

388
00:35:05,903 --> 00:35:07,878
Are you still worried about the bike?

389
00:35:07,952 --> 00:35:10,855
Yeah.
And that is why you have to be there.

390
00:35:10,929 --> 00:35:15,719
You see, I've got a contingency plan
that Graeme doesn't know about.

391
00:35:17,394 --> 00:35:22,992
I thought if you knew right away
you might think I was after your soul.

392
00:35:23,059 --> 00:35:24,368
And aren't you?

393
00:35:24,435 --> 00:35:27,435
Souls are God's business.

394
00:35:27,508 --> 00:35:29,003
Mine is people.

395
00:35:31,924 --> 00:35:34,380
So, how are you feeling?

396
00:35:35,509 --> 00:35:37,135
Under control.

397
00:35:38,294 --> 00:35:41,393
Well, the hour is almost at hand.

398
00:35:42,486 --> 00:35:43,981
Bring it on.

399
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:46,257
I'm raring to go.

400
00:36:01,819 --> 00:36:03,477
Good turnout.

401
00:36:03,547 --> 00:36:07,574
It's not for me. They're getting ready
to announce the world championships.

402
00:36:07,643 --> 00:36:11,190
Moser's over there.
Francesco Moser is over there.

403
00:36:11,261 --> 00:36:13,563
GRAEME: He's on the WCF council now.

404
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,539
Who's that with him?

405
00:36:15,614 --> 00:36:17,403
I don't know. Some suit.

406
00:36:17,470 --> 00:36:20,766
Right, let's get Old Faithful put together,
give them all a heart attack.

407
00:36:20,831 --> 00:36:22,108
Can I talk to you first?

408
00:36:22,175 --> 00:36:23,385
What about?

409
00:36:23,935 --> 00:36:25,015
Actually...

410
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,578
Can I show you something?

411
00:36:42,147 --> 00:36:45,890
I got onto Mike Burrows,
told him what the situation was

412
00:36:45,955 --> 00:36:49,371
and he said okay, he'd take a crack at it.

413
00:36:49,444 --> 00:36:50,786
I didn't know
if it was gonna be ready in time,

414
00:36:50,852 --> 00:36:53,919
that's why I haven't said anything till now.

415
00:37:00,039 --> 00:37:05,026
I gave him all the specs.
It's exactly the same as Old Faithful.

416
00:37:05,096 --> 00:37:07,267
All the ideas that you built into it,

417
00:37:07,336 --> 00:37:10,632
but it's the work
of a world-class bike builder.

418
00:37:10,697 --> 00:37:13,064
And I think you should...

419
00:37:13,129 --> 00:37:14,853
You know...

420
00:37:21,003 --> 00:37:22,377
What do you think?

421
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:31,912
Well, it's not exactly the same
as Old Faithful.

422
00:37:31,981 --> 00:37:35,560
Burrows has used 32 mil not 16.

423
00:37:37,006 --> 00:37:39,690
- So it's heavier.
- Right.

424
00:37:40,815 --> 00:37:43,466
Hey, the wheels... Specialized made them.

425
00:37:43,535 --> 00:37:47,813
And if you beat the record,
they'll sponsor you for a whole year.

426
00:37:47,888 --> 00:37:50,310
Just give me a minute, will you?

427
00:37:51,665 --> 00:37:52,613
Sure.

428
00:37:59,059 --> 00:38:00,684
You knew about this?

429
00:38:00,754 --> 00:38:03,919
You always said
Mike Burrows knows what he's doing.

430
00:38:03,987 --> 00:38:06,257
Don't use it if you don't want to.

431
00:38:16,790 --> 00:38:18,001
FRANCESCO: Graeme!

432
00:38:19,254 --> 00:38:20,661
My friend!

433
00:38:23,095 --> 00:38:26,805
Allow me to introduce Ernst Hagemann.

434
00:38:26,872 --> 00:38:28,879
- It's nice to meet you.
- Hello.

435
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:33,843
You built this yourself?

436
00:38:33,913 --> 00:38:35,801
No, it was Mike Burrows.

437
00:38:35,865 --> 00:38:39,827
I did the design
and put together the original model.

438
00:38:42,587 --> 00:38:44,856
What is wrong with the original?

439
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:48,568
It took a bit of a battering
in the road trial stage so...

440
00:38:52,189 --> 00:38:54,906
Don't worry,
it conforms to every WCF regulation,

441
00:38:54,973 --> 00:38:57,462
I made sure of that.

442
00:38:57,534 --> 00:38:59,674
It doesn't worry me, Mr. Obree.

443
00:38:59,743 --> 00:39:03,605
It would only matter if you were
to break Francesco's record.

444
00:39:13,154 --> 00:39:14,169
Graeme, wait, please.

445
00:39:14,241 --> 00:39:17,089
OFFICIAL: Okay, ladies and gentlemen,
clear the track please.

446
00:39:18,946 --> 00:39:21,314
MALKY: Okay, 205 laps...
OFFICIAL: Graeme, this is it.

447
00:39:21,379 --> 00:39:22,524
MALKY: That's what you've got to beat.
OFFICIAL: Set's ready.

448
00:39:22,595 --> 00:39:23,741
OFFICIAL: Give me a nod and I'll give you...
MALKY: Fifty-one...

449
00:39:23,812 --> 00:39:25,568
OFFICIAL:... a five second countdown.
MALKY:... point one five kilometers...

450
00:39:25,636 --> 00:39:27,327
That's 31.7 miles.

451
00:39:27,396 --> 00:39:31,227
Which is almost exactly the same
as the journey from Prestwick to Glasgow

452
00:39:31,301 --> 00:39:32,993
but no hills.

453
00:39:33,062 --> 00:39:36,510
No traffic, no roundabouts.

454
00:39:37,767 --> 00:39:39,425
And when the gun goes off,
you've broken the world record.

455
00:39:39,494 --> 00:39:42,080
OFFICIAL: In five, four,

456
00:39:42,151 --> 00:39:45,567
three, two, one. Go!

457
00:39:45,896 --> 00:39:48,231
Come on, Graeme! Come on!

458
00:39:48,681 --> 00:39:49,958
Come on, Graeme!

459
00:39:50,025 --> 00:39:53,441
Come on, Graeme, you can do it.
I know you can do it, come on!

460
00:40:10,605 --> 00:40:13,922
MALKY: Go on!
ANNE: Come on, Graeme, come on!

461
00:40:26,256 --> 00:40:27,303
MALKY: Go on, Graeme!

462
00:40:27,376 --> 00:40:30,279
ANNE: Come on, Graeme!
Come on, keep going, come on.

463
00:40:37,043 --> 00:40:38,570
(PANTING)

464
00:40:46,932 --> 00:40:49,388
Go on, Graeme! Go on.

465
00:40:57,334 --> 00:40:58,895
Go on, Graeme!

466
00:41:13,753 --> 00:41:15,412
Come on, Graeme!

467
00:41:21,499 --> 00:41:24,500
Well done, Graeme.

468
00:41:35,230 --> 00:41:37,402
Well, he's missed it.

469
00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:42,778
ANNE: Graeme!

470
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,596
Graeme, are you okay?

471
00:41:45,664 --> 00:41:49,527
MALKY: That was a brilliant effort, Graeme.
Just two laps off, that's all!

472
00:41:49,601 --> 00:41:51,641
You did bloody great.

473
00:41:51,713 --> 00:41:53,240
It was the bike, it was that new bike.

474
00:41:53,313 --> 00:41:55,321
It wasn't the bike, it was me.

475
00:41:55,394 --> 00:41:56,768
Okay, get all these people out of here.

476
00:41:56,835 --> 00:41:58,177
Just do it, Malky!

477
00:41:58,243 --> 00:42:01,091
Look, just step back.
Give him some air. Come on!

478
00:42:01,155 --> 00:42:02,814
Step back.

479
00:42:03,972 --> 00:42:07,585
This is total fucking failure again.

480
00:42:07,653 --> 00:42:11,396
Don't do that. Look at me.
Graeme, don't do that.

481
00:42:12,486 --> 00:42:14,558
Don't do that, Graeme.

482
00:42:15,591 --> 00:42:17,795
Okay. Okay.

483
00:42:26,793 --> 00:42:29,892
REPORTER: Wait. No, he's going over here.
MAN: Get out of the way, you.

484
00:42:30,185 --> 00:42:32,706
REPORTER: Wait, wait, wait.
Graeme, how are you feeling?

485
00:42:36,363 --> 00:42:40,357
- FRANCESCO: Bravo, sandwich man!
- I'm going again.

486
00:42:40,427 --> 00:42:43,723
Impossible, the WCF must have access.

487
00:42:43,788 --> 00:42:47,105
Well, 24 hours, that was what my manager
agreed with the people here.

488
00:42:47,181 --> 00:42:49,548
So, we've got the stadium
till 10:30 tomorrow morning.

489
00:42:49,613 --> 00:42:52,166
- But Graeme...
- 9:00 tomorrow morning.

490
00:42:52,237 --> 00:42:53,350
You English are mad!

491
00:42:53,422 --> 00:42:55,975
You wanna know what mad is,
try calling me English again.

492
00:42:56,046 --> 00:42:59,080
I'm a Bavarian,
I'm very proud to be called German.

493
00:42:59,151 --> 00:43:01,039
But I know you Irish Scots
are always fighting

494
00:43:01,103 --> 00:43:03,973
<i>you can't help it, ja?</i>

495
00:43:09,489 --> 00:43:11,115
What are you doing?

496
00:43:11,186 --> 00:43:12,812
GRAEME: Making sure I exercise
every couple of hours

497
00:43:12,882 --> 00:43:15,086
to stop my legs seizing up.

498
00:43:15,154 --> 00:43:17,904
No alarm clock like a full bladder.

499
00:44:27,745 --> 00:44:30,648
We've slept in! We've slept in!

500
00:44:30,722 --> 00:44:33,144
We've gotta be on the tracks
in 30 minutes.

501
00:44:34,819 --> 00:44:36,608
Where in the bloody hell's Malky?

502
00:44:39,012 --> 00:44:39,994
(BANGING ON DOOR)

503
00:44:40,068 --> 00:44:42,719
GRAEME: Malky! Malky!

504
00:44:46,021 --> 00:44:47,777
We're late.

505
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:54,213
MALKY: I've rebuilt Old Faithful for you.

506
00:44:56,679 --> 00:44:58,501
She's ready if you're ready.

507
00:44:58,567 --> 00:45:00,356
Malky, you wee beauty.

508
00:45:34,351 --> 00:45:36,839
That clock should be set.
What's wrong with it?

509
00:45:36,911 --> 00:45:40,523
- ANNE: I think he slept in as well.
- This is a shambles.

510
00:45:43,601 --> 00:45:45,805
Excuse me! He's going for it now.

511
00:45:45,873 --> 00:45:49,038
Excuse me! He's going for it now!

512
00:45:51,794 --> 00:45:54,576
- MAN 1: Oh, please, after you.
- Thank you.

513
00:46:00,532 --> 00:46:02,125
MAN 2: I haven't had breakfast.

514
00:46:12,759 --> 00:46:14,701
This is insanity, Graeme.

515
00:46:14,775 --> 00:46:19,118
You will cripple yourself,
maybe something even worse than that.

516
00:46:35,195 --> 00:46:37,562
Right, you ready? Go!

517
00:46:37,628 --> 00:46:40,945
ANNE: Come on, Graeme!

would not talk about.
