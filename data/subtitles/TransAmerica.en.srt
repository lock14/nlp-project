1
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:22,998
I'm gonna say our mantra,
"This is the voice I want to use"...

2
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:26,207
...over and over again,
but with different inflections.

3
00:00:26,375 --> 00:00:28,998
And I want you to try and mimic
what I'm doing.

4
00:00:29,207 --> 00:00:33,457
This is the voice I want to use.
This is the voice I want to use.

5
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:37,914
Now, I'm gonna press down
on our tongue and watch...

6
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,874
...what's happening
in the back of our mouths. Ready?

7
00:02:06,082 --> 00:02:09,164
- Any suicidal tendencies?
- No.

8
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,664
- Have you ever felt as though
you were being followed? - No.

9
00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:18,123
- Any history
of family mental illness? - No.

10
00:02:18,707 --> 00:02:20,914
Medical procedures to date?

11
00:02:21,415 --> 00:02:24,998
The usual electrolysis,
3 years of hormone therapy...

12
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:30,206
...facial feminization surgery,
a brow lift, forehead reduction...

13
00:02:30,457 --> 00:02:33,664
...jaw re-contouring,
and a tracheal shave.

14
00:02:35,332 --> 00:02:36,998
You look very authentic.

15
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,998
I try to blend in,
keep a low profile.

16
00:02:41,707 --> 00:02:44,581
I believe the slang terminology
is "living stealth".

17
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:49,164
- Do you consider yourself
a happy person? - Yes.

18
00:02:50,832 --> 00:02:54,956
I mean, no.
I mean... I will be.

19
00:02:55,125 --> 00:02:58,831
Miss Osborne, there's no such thing
as a right answer in this office.

20
00:02:58,957 --> 00:03:01,706
Yes. I'm a very happy person.

21
00:03:02,457 --> 00:03:05,248
How can I help you
if you won't be honest with me?

22
00:03:06,207 --> 00:03:09,206
You can sign that consent form.
Please.

23
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:13,414
The American Psychiatric Association
categorizes gender dysphoria...

24
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,748
...as a very serious mental disorder.

25
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:23,164
After my operation not even a
gynecologist will be able to detect...

26
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:25,831
...anything out of the ordinary
about my body.

27
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,123
I will be a woman.

28
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:33,039
Don't you find it odd that plastic
surgery can cure a mental disorder?

29
00:03:34,665 --> 00:03:36,581
How do you feel about your penis?

30
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,873
It disgusts me.

31
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:44,748
I don't even like looking at it.

32
00:03:45,207 --> 00:03:48,164
- What about friends?
- They don't like it either.

33
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:52,331
No. I mean, do you have
the support of friends?

34
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:55,706
I'm very close to my therapist.

35
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,581
What about your family?

36
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,873
My family is dead.

37
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:06,664
#You take some hormones,
and I'll take some hormones. #

38
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:10,206
#I'II be a woman
before you. #

39
00:04:10,332 --> 00:04:15,956
#You make me happy when... #
Shit!

40
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,831
I mean darn. Darn it. Darn it.
Darn it. Darn it. Darn it.

41
00:04:25,915 --> 00:04:28,331
Good night, Bree.
Sleep tight, Bree.

42
00:04:52,332 --> 00:04:53,581
¡Olé!

43
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:05,206
This is the voice. Hi.

44
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:10,624
This is the voice.

45
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:17,624
Hello. May I please speak to Mr.
Or Mrs. Bhumibol Niratpattanasai?

46
00:05:18,707 --> 00:05:21,874
Mrs. Niratpattanasai,
this is Bree Osborne calling...

47
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,624
...with a special introductory offer
from the National Home Shopping...

48
00:05:25,832 --> 00:05:33,540
Hello?

49
00:05:35,957 --> 00:05:39,124
Stanley Schupak doesn't live
here anymore. Who's calling?

50
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,499
Stanley doesn't have a son.
You must have the wrong number.

51
00:05:51,332 --> 00:05:52,624
How old are you?

52
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,415
Why don't you call your mother?

53
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,206
Hello. May I please speak
to Mr. Jamal Niang?

54
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,956
Mr. Niang, it's Bree Osborne calling
from the National Home Shopping Club...

55
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:34,540
...with a special introductory rate
of only $19.90... Hello?

56
00:06:36,875 --> 00:06:40,374
- He signed it.
- I am so proud of you!

57
00:06:40,625 --> 00:06:44,956
Two signatures. I hereby
pronounce you officially legal...

58
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:48,081
...to undergo
sexual reassignment surgery.

59
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,540
Thank you.

60
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,706
I... I just...

61
00:06:57,457 --> 00:06:58,499
Thank you.

62
00:06:58,625 --> 00:07:01,249
So, what else is new?

63
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:06,665
I made my sales quota for the month
on Tuesday.

64
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:12,456
That pink lamb's wool cardigan
that I ordered arrived.

65
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,331
Oh, and this is odd.
I got a phone call last night...

66
00:07:16,457 --> 00:07:19,499
...from a juvenile inmate
of the New York prison system.

67
00:07:19,707 --> 00:07:22,999
- He claimed to be Stanley's son.
- No third person.

68
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,581
My son.

69
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,624
I thought you told me
that you were a virgin.

70
00:07:31,750 --> 00:07:35,206
There was this one girl in college.
But the whole thing was so...

71
00:07:36,082 --> 00:07:38,999
...tragically lesbian
that I didn't think it counted.

72
00:07:39,915 --> 00:07:40,956
Wow!

73
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:44,706
- A son!
- An alleged son.

74
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,249
He's probably
just some sort of scam artist.

75
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:48,874
What's he scamming you for?

76
00:07:50,582 --> 00:07:52,040
I guess we'll never know.

77
00:07:52,165 --> 00:07:55,915
Nothing is gonna stop me from
checking into that hospital next week.

78
00:07:56,415 --> 00:07:59,749
I'm not gonna get dragged back
into Stanley's old life.

79
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,624
Stanley's life is your life!

80
00:08:03,415 --> 00:08:06,665
- Why don't you get in touch
with the mother? - She's dead.

81
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,581
Anyway, he's a teen. He's old enough
to take care of himself.

82
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:17,665
Bree, this is a part of your body
that cannot be discarded.

83
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:21,624
I don't want you to go
through this metamorphosis...

84
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,999
...only to find out
you're still incomplete.

85
00:08:27,082 --> 00:08:28,415
What if I...

86
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,164
...visit him later...
after my surgery, after I've...

87
00:08:34,375 --> 00:08:35,999
...settled into my new life?

88
00:08:38,332 --> 00:08:39,664
When you're ready.

89
00:08:40,375 --> 00:08:41,499
What are you doing?

90
00:08:44,707 --> 00:08:47,249
I can't give this
to your surgeon right now.

91
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,374
Yes, you can.
I can't miss my surgery on Friday.

92
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,539
They're booked up a year in advance.

93
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:59,706
I'II wire bail money to New York.

94
00:09:00,207 --> 00:09:04,164
I'II call a social worker
and have someone check in on him.

95
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:06,374
- What do you want me to do?
- Bree...

96
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,206
...honey, I just want you to be ready.

97
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:54,456
Hello? May I please have
the number of the New York City...

98
00:09:55,165 --> 00:09:56,581
...downtown lock-up?

99
00:10:12,832 --> 00:10:17,499
- Mr. Schupak? - Ms. Schupak.
I mean, Ms. Osborne. I changed it.

100
00:10:18,666 --> 00:10:21,499
Can I ask what your relationship is
to the prisoner?

101
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:24,039
Allegedly I'm his...

102
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:28,039
Allegedly he's... my son.

103
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:32,331
This is a new one. According to this,
he shoplifted a frog!

104
00:10:32,582 --> 00:10:35,706
Plus we have testimony that he was
in possession of a small amount...

105
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,999
...of a suspicious-looking
white powder.

106
00:10:38,082 --> 00:10:41,539
Although emergency services was unable
to recover the evidence.

107
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:45,999
Drugs? Is he an addict?

108
00:10:46,207 --> 00:10:47,331
Most of them are.

109
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:50,414
Most of whom are?

110
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,331
Are you aware that your son's
been hustling on the streets...

111
00:10:53,457 --> 00:10:54,999
...working as a prostitute?

112
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,999
- How much is the bail?
- Bail's set at 1 dollar.

113
00:10:59,165 --> 00:11:02,999
I can't possibly afford...
1 dollar?

114
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:07,956
Sabrina Claire Osborne!

115
00:11:10,082 --> 00:11:11,499
Meet Toby Wilkins.

116
00:11:17,582 --> 00:11:19,039
My friends call me Bree.

117
00:11:21,957 --> 00:11:23,374
Jesus the Reformer?

118
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:27,874
That's one of these churches
sending missionaries out...

119
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,999
...to guide street people back to God.
- No.

120
00:11:32,332 --> 00:11:33,414
I'm...

121
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,999
...from the Church
of the Potential Father.

122
00:11:55,665 --> 00:11:56,749
Oh, yes.

123
00:12:00,957 --> 00:12:07,414
Dear God, bless this food,
and bless this restaurant...

124
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:13,374
...and all the people in it,
and everyone else... everywhere.

125
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,124
Sic transit gloria mundi,
in excelsis Deo. Amen.

126
00:12:23,207 --> 00:12:26,289
Do you have any percs?
Vicodin? Anything with codeine?

127
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,164
Sorry, I'm all out.

128
00:12:29,916 --> 00:12:32,581
So why don't you tell me
something about yourself?

129
00:12:32,707 --> 00:12:34,124
I'm not naming any names.

130
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:38,456
I said about yourself!
Is Toby short for something?

131
00:12:38,582 --> 00:12:42,249
- A diminutive?
- No, it's American.

132
00:12:45,582 --> 00:12:46,999
Where do you come from?

133
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,499
- Callicoon.
- Where's Callicoon?

134
00:12:49,915 --> 00:12:51,749
In Kentucky. Duh.

135
00:12:52,165 --> 00:12:53,956
Is that where your family is?

136
00:12:54,415 --> 00:12:57,124
My mother's dead.
She had a stroke.

137
00:13:01,082 --> 00:13:02,539
Is there anyone else?

138
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,289
- I had a stepfather.
- That's wonderful!

139
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:07,206
Me and him don't get along.

140
00:13:07,332 --> 00:13:08,831
- Why not?
- T.M.I.

141
00:13:10,082 --> 00:13:12,706
Too much information.

142
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:17,039
What about grandparents?
Aunts? Uncles?

143
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,999
I don't need any family.
I can take care of myself.

144
00:13:20,707 --> 00:13:21,831
I'm a Ioner.

145
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:25,914
That's wonderful.
That's the spirit.

146
00:13:32,957 --> 00:13:35,581
I've been meaning to thank you
for bailing me out.

147
00:13:36,415 --> 00:13:37,456
You're welcome.

148
00:13:38,332 --> 00:13:41,164
I decided in jail, I'm going
to give up hustling.

149
00:13:41,457 --> 00:13:43,999
- It's degradable.
- Degrading.

150
00:13:47,707 --> 00:13:52,289
- How many... people inhabit...
this place? - 3.

151
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:56,749
By the way, I was just holding those
drugs for a friend. I'm not stupid.

152
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,999
Junkies just live for the day,
no ambition or anything.

153
00:14:01,916 --> 00:14:03,956
- You have ambition?
- Yeah.

154
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:06,206
I'm gonna get a career
in the movies.

155
00:14:14,082 --> 00:14:16,831
10... 20... 40.

156
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:25,749
60... 80... 100.

157
00:14:26,957 --> 00:14:27,999
Here.

158
00:14:30,375 --> 00:14:34,164
- Will it hold you for a while?
- Yeah. Dude, this is great.

159
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,414
I wish you'd stop calling me "dude"!

160
00:14:38,125 --> 00:14:40,539
Well, I best be on my way.

161
00:14:40,957 --> 00:14:43,664
I've got a flight to Los Angeles
early in the morning.

162
00:14:43,832 --> 00:14:47,414
Maybe I'll see you out there. That's
where they make the movies, right?

163
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:50,081
I'm gonna hitchhike out there,
like... tomorrow.

164
00:14:50,207 --> 00:14:51,249
You can't.

165
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:54,414
You don't wanna add jumping bail
to your permanent record.

166
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,206
I'II change my street name.

167
00:14:56,957 --> 00:15:01,749
Something like Stanley. Stan.
Stan the Man.

168
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,039
That's my dad's name.

169
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:06,831
There's his picture.

170
00:15:10,416 --> 00:15:11,581
He's with my mom.

171
00:15:21,582 --> 00:15:22,624
Are you okay?

172
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,206
I'm a little dizzy.

173
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,249
Beverly Hills is close
to the ocean, right?

174
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,956
Maybe I'll learn how to surf.
Dye my hair blonde for the movies.

175
00:15:32,082 --> 00:15:36,624
They love blonds there. "Blond
in Blond", "Stocks and Blonds"...

176
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:40,664
..."Bodacious Blond Bottoms".
Not that I'm a bottom or anything.

177
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,374
Are you talking
about pornographic films?

178
00:15:44,582 --> 00:15:45,624
Duh.

179
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,624
Is there a...

180
00:15:49,207 --> 00:15:51,706
...ladies room
in this establishment?

181
00:16:06,207 --> 00:16:09,624
- Hello? - Margaret, it's Bree.
I'm in New York.

182
00:16:10,082 --> 00:16:14,081
It turns out this whole jail episode
was just a big mistake.

183
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:15,831
Talk to me!

184
00:16:17,166 --> 00:16:19,414
He's a thoroughly
independent young man!

185
00:16:20,332 --> 00:16:22,624
We're getting along famously.

186
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:26,124
He's going to come visit me
after my surgery and...

187
00:16:26,625 --> 00:16:29,999
...I promised to take him
to Disneyland. - I see.

188
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:33,914
So I thought I'd take an early flight
back tomorrow. Get back to work.

189
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,956
Recoup some of the money I spent on
this trip before my surgery next week.

190
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:39,749
How are you?

191
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,374
Right now I'm a little disappointed
because you're lying to me.

192
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,289
Is there anything else
you'd like to say?

193
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,914
There appears to be a step-father.
Perhaps I can effect a reunion.

194
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,624
Have you ever heard of a place
called Callicoon?

195
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:07,457
I just conferred with my immediate
superior at The Church.

196
00:17:08,165 --> 00:17:12,332
She feels that getting you away
from this unwholesome environment...

197
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:13,957
...is my moral duty.

198
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:18,707
Free ride, free food,
free motel rooms, all the way to L.A.

199
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,624
Uh-uh. Nothing's free.

200
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:24,164
You're gonna end up marrying her
and spending all your life...

201
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:27,039
...eating out
cobwebby old stank Christian pussy.

202
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,289
Something for the road, my man?
The finest Tecate!

203
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:33,664
Fuck no, man.
I'm giving that shit up.

204
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:36,707
Come on, it's only 5 dollars a bag
over street price!

205
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,289
Convenience charge!

206
00:17:38,415 --> 00:17:40,914
We could take it out of your cut
if she buys the car.

207
00:17:41,165 --> 00:17:42,289
Fuck you, dude.

208
00:17:42,665 --> 00:17:43,707
Alright.

209
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,457
- Whatever! You're the man!
- No. Wait. Hey.

210
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:53,832
I'm not marrying you.

211
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:56,707
Glory hallelujah!

212
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,914
Almost a new fan belt.

213
00:17:59,208 --> 00:18:02,999
I changed the oil 2 months ago,
only 230,000 miles.

214
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,414
It just needs a little paint.
That's all. It runs perfect.

215
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,164
- Guaranteed.
- I've already arranged a rental.

216
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:13,457
But, when you get to California,
you could resell it, make a profit.

217
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:15,999
A profit?

218
00:18:19,208 --> 00:18:22,082
- Fasten your seat belt.
- I don't like wearing them.

219
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:25,874
Well, I don't like the idea
of seeing your internal organs...

220
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,457
...splattered all over the dashboard
in case we get in a wreck, God forbid.

221
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,414
- So put it on.
- See this shirt?

222
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,374
It cost me 2 dollars.

223
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:39,664
- Quelle surprise! - These shoes?
3 dollars, 1.50 each.

224
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:42,914
- You know how much these things
are worth in Japan? - 3 dollars?

225
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:46,832
Like, 500 dollars. Japanese people
will kill for old Nikes.

226
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,832
Then you probably should avoid
wearing them in Japan.

227
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,749
Yeah. I'd probably be
like disemboweled by a ninja.

228
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,582
You don't have to say "like".

229
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,082
"Probably disemboweled by a ninja"
is sufficient.

230
00:18:59,290 --> 00:19:01,707
And, please, don't put your feet
up on the dashboard.

231
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,999
No smoking in the car.

232
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,207
I thought instead of going west
on Route 95...

233
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,914
...we'd wind through the mountains
on Route 20.

234
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,414
Route 20 takes us
close to Callicoon.

235
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,039
I don't wanna go there.

236
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:32,289
What I find absolutely
beyond comprehension...

237
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,832
...is how a person
can perform all those...

238
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:38,999
...intimate acts
with just any stranger off the street.

239
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,499
Why should you give a shit?

240
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,664
Because it's
the Christian thing to do.

241
00:19:44,040 --> 00:19:46,164
How much money did you make per...

242
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,624
...assignation?
- $40 or $50.

243
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:54,289
- Are we gonna be going through Texas?
- Pretty hard to avoid it!

244
00:19:57,165 --> 00:19:59,082
Do you have any money
for some food?

245
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,999
I'm sorry
I can't offer you a private room.

246
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,124
The church has to conserve
its resources.

247
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:02,207
I've charted us a course
on the nice, little red roads.

248
00:21:02,665 --> 00:21:05,457
Callicoon is only about 45 minutes
out of our way.

249
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:07,832
I don't wanna go there.

250
00:21:09,415 --> 00:21:10,874
These are nice beds!

251
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,539
Don't you have any pajamas?

252
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,832
- No.
- Well...

253
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,457
...you should get some.

254
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:25,624
Good night.

255
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,374
Rise and shine!

256
00:21:36,625 --> 00:21:37,664
Up, up, up!

257
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,289
We've got a schedule to keep.

258
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:46,249
Did I put on too much blush?

259
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:48,707
You're weird.

260
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:07,207
The first place I lived was like
a hole in the wall off Avenue C.

261
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,539
I had, like, 4 roommates.
One was...

262
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,457
...a junkie, one was a crackhead...

263
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,082
...one was like a junkie,
and the other one was...

264
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:18,039
...like a junkie.
- Like, like, like!

265
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:24,124
Did you know that
the Lord of the Rings is gay?

266
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:26,039
I beg your pardon?

267
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:31,124
There's this big black tower, right?
And it points right at this...

268
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:36,624
...huge burning vagina thing. And it's
like the symbol of ultimate evil.

269
00:22:36,833 --> 00:22:40,624
And then Sam and Frodo
have to go into this cave...

270
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:46,249
...and deposit their magic ring
into this hot steaming lava pit.

271
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,249
Only at the last minute...

272
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:53,082
...Frodo can't perform,
so Gollum bites off his finger.

273
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:55,957
Gay.

274
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,957
What the fuck are you looking at?

275
00:23:40,665 --> 00:23:42,582
I just didn't think it was right...

276
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:46,414
...to come so close to Callicoon
without at least passing through.

277
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:48,332
Toby!

278
00:23:51,915 --> 00:23:53,249
Where are you going?

279
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,249
You're acting like a spoiled child!

280
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:03,582
Oh, my God! I can't believe my eyes!
It's my sweet little angel baby!

281
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:14,624
Give me another hug!

282
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:18,039
I could wring your neck
like a chicken! My favorite boy!

283
00:24:18,208 --> 00:24:21,832
And not even a phone call to tell me
if you're alive or dead!

284
00:24:21,958 --> 00:24:24,582
- I was never your favorite.
- That's what you think.

285
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:29,582
I used to look at him out that window,
playing all day with that big dog.

286
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:32,582
- Toby lived near here?
- Just 2 doors up the road!

287
00:24:33,290 --> 00:24:37,207
So, what've you been doing with
yourself? I wanna know everything.

288
00:24:40,875 --> 00:24:42,207
He's been in New York...

289
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:45,457
...working toward developing a career
in the film industry.

290
00:24:45,875 --> 00:24:48,624
- I'm going to California.
- California?!

291
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:51,539
He always was the artistic type!

292
00:24:52,708 --> 00:24:55,249
He used to have
this precious stuffed monkey...

293
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:58,164
...he carried around with him
everywhere, even to school!

294
00:24:58,625 --> 00:25:02,414
- Are you in the movie business too?
- She's a missionary with the church.

295
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,707
Praise the Lord!

296
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:06,164
I'm an electrolygist myself.

297
00:25:07,333 --> 00:25:11,332
If you want, I can get those little
hairs up under your nose for you!

298
00:25:14,583 --> 00:25:18,332
My boss lady down at the salon
used to work out in California.

299
00:25:19,165 --> 00:25:22,539
From what I hear,
some of the Hollywood beauties...

300
00:25:22,833 --> 00:25:24,999
...used to be as hairy as hogs.

301
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:30,039
That ought to keep them
from sticking their heads up again!

302
00:25:30,165 --> 00:25:31,164
Thank you.

303
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:33,832
You ought to go
and say hello to your step-daddy!

304
00:25:33,958 --> 00:25:36,039
- I don't wanna see him.
- Of course you do.

305
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:42,207
The man raised you, clothed you,
fed you, sheltered you from harm.

306
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:44,414
He's your father...

307
00:25:45,125 --> 00:25:47,039
...for all practical purposes.

308
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,082
He always was a sensitive thing.

309
00:25:51,625 --> 00:25:54,332
Are you going to drive him
all the way to California?

310
00:25:55,833 --> 00:25:58,582
I have to get some air.
Excuse me. And thank you.

311
00:26:09,333 --> 00:26:10,999
- Yeah?
- Good evening.

312
00:26:11,625 --> 00:26:15,624
- Do you per chance know
a Toby Wilkins? - Who's asking?

313
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,664
I am a bearer of glad tidings.

314
00:26:19,458 --> 00:26:21,457
Your son has come home!

315
00:26:23,750 --> 00:26:24,914
Good!

316
00:26:26,665 --> 00:26:28,999
Toby! Arletty!
I brought back a surprise.

317
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,499
Come on in.

318
00:26:34,750 --> 00:26:36,374
Look who's here!

319
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:39,164
If you can't bring Mohamed
to the mountain...

320
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,082
...bring the mountain to Mohamed!

321
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:43,039
Look how much you've grown!

322
00:26:44,208 --> 00:26:45,999
Toby, give your father a hug!

323
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:48,874
I was worried sick about you.
Why'd you run off like that?

324
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,914
- I missed you.
- Isn't this sweet?

325
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,999
I know what you missed.
You missed my mouth, my ass.

326
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:57,957
You hush now.
What are these ladies gonna think?

327
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,832
You wanna fuck me
in front of them?

328
00:26:59,958 --> 00:27:00,999
You shut up!

329
00:27:01,083 --> 00:27:02,124
Bobby!

330
00:27:02,915 --> 00:27:04,332
Was that good for you?

331
00:27:04,708 --> 00:27:05,914
Come on, Bobby.

332
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,082
You liked it.

333
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:10,582
- You liked in the...
- Shut up!

334
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,082
Come on!

335
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,039
Toby...

336
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:25,332
Honey...

337
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:40,039
This man's heavy with sin.

338
00:27:40,333 --> 00:27:41,999
Put him in that chair there.

339
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:49,332
I don't know you, Bobby Jensen.

340
00:27:50,708 --> 00:27:52,499
He'll come to in a couple of hours.

341
00:28:07,165 --> 00:28:08,832
This isn't my fault!

342
00:28:10,915 --> 00:28:13,582
You never told me
why you didn't wanna come home.

343
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:19,624
Where are you going?

344
00:28:42,875 --> 00:28:44,457
I brought you some breakfast...

345
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:59,332
He's walking down to the highway ramp
to hitchhike himself a ride.

346
00:28:59,625 --> 00:29:01,457
He's a disappearing act.

347
00:29:01,915 --> 00:29:04,999
It's the same thing he did
after his mama killed herself.

348
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,582
She what?

349
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:10,999
She shut herself up in the garage
with the car on.

350
00:29:11,125 --> 00:29:13,957
Toby found her there
when he came home from school.

351
00:29:15,165 --> 00:29:16,414
Oh, God!

352
00:29:56,958 --> 00:29:59,499
Lovely scenery
in this part of the country.

353
00:29:59,833 --> 00:30:03,874
I took a ride from you, I never said
I'd carry on a fucking conversation.

354
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,999
I was just trying
to do you a favor!

355
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,914
Considering the way you've been living
your life it wasn't unreasonable...

356
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,289
...to try to put you
under some parental supervision.

357
00:30:17,290 --> 00:30:19,539
What's that? Is that drugs?

358
00:30:19,708 --> 00:30:21,499
Oh, no! Absolutely not!

359
00:30:22,750 --> 00:30:23,832
God damn it!

360
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,249
No! That is not alright!
You can't do that here! No!

361
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:31,832
Are you gonna let me do my thing
or do I have to get out right now?

362
00:30:33,333 --> 00:30:34,374
Go ahead.

363
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:36,499
Kill yourself.

364
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,749
What does it matter to me?

365
00:30:46,458 --> 00:30:50,207
One chocolate milkshake for you
and coffee for your mother.

366
00:30:51,165 --> 00:30:52,499
I'm not his mother.

367
00:31:52,165 --> 00:31:54,999
I didn't sleep a wink last night.
Let's look for a motel.

368
00:31:55,125 --> 00:31:56,332
I'm camping out.

369
00:32:10,625 --> 00:32:12,999
Do you have something
a trifle less...

370
00:32:14,375 --> 00:32:15,624
...butch?

371
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,707
Fettuccine Alfredo
or Chicken Cordon Bleu?

372
00:32:22,208 --> 00:32:23,374
Chicken.

373
00:32:25,958 --> 00:32:27,082
Matches?

374
00:32:32,208 --> 00:32:33,332
Fuck!

375
00:32:35,665 --> 00:32:38,832
Excuse me.
I have to go to the ladies room.

376
00:32:51,915 --> 00:32:54,207
Do you think
there are snakes around here?

377
00:33:01,208 --> 00:33:06,457
Get away, snakes!

378
00:33:26,708 --> 00:33:28,039
Where did you get that?

379
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:30,289
I had it.

380
00:33:32,583 --> 00:33:34,249
What is that awful sound?

381
00:33:35,125 --> 00:33:36,332
It's a loon.

382
00:33:36,958 --> 00:33:40,082
Certain Native American tribes
of the northern plains...

383
00:33:40,583 --> 00:33:43,624
...believed loons were
ancestral spirits...

384
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:46,664
...trying to communicate
with the physical world.

385
00:33:49,583 --> 00:33:51,249
My real dad's part Indian.

386
00:33:52,165 --> 00:33:53,207
Is he?

387
00:33:53,875 --> 00:33:57,207
Yeah. He never told me,
but I just know.

388
00:33:58,583 --> 00:33:59,832
It's an Indian thing.

389
00:34:04,415 --> 00:34:08,498
Do you think you could find it in your
heart to offer a sip of it to a lady?

390
00:34:13,875 --> 00:34:15,289
Are you sick or something?

391
00:34:19,708 --> 00:34:20,831
I'm fine.

392
00:34:22,666 --> 00:34:24,081
These are vitamins.

393
00:34:25,041 --> 00:34:26,664
When I was a little girl...

394
00:34:26,958 --> 00:34:28,623
...I had a terry cloth bunny.

395
00:34:29,041 --> 00:34:31,123
I used to sleep with her every night.

396
00:34:31,875 --> 00:34:33,289
Try holding your breath.

397
00:34:33,416 --> 00:34:36,456
Then one day my parents decided
I was too old for her...

398
00:34:36,583 --> 00:34:38,664
...and I never saw her again.

399
00:34:41,666 --> 00:34:43,706
I found him...

400
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,914
...in your step-father's garage.

401
00:34:56,333 --> 00:34:57,498
Here...

402
00:35:21,833 --> 00:35:23,206
Rise and shine!

403
00:35:23,750 --> 00:35:26,373
Come on! Let's go!

404
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,289
I've got to be in L.A.
By the end of the week.

405
00:35:29,416 --> 00:35:32,956
What would you say if I told you
I could set you up with a job...

406
00:35:33,041 --> 00:35:34,706
...in the telemarketing field?

407
00:35:35,708 --> 00:35:39,206
The nice thing about telemarketing is
you can live any place.

408
00:35:39,375 --> 00:35:41,706
I could drop you off in... Austin.

409
00:35:42,291 --> 00:35:46,081
I'm going to California. My real dad
has a mansion there with a pool.

410
00:35:47,875 --> 00:35:51,914
What do you see your life like,
10 years from now?

411
00:35:52,708 --> 00:35:56,873
Probably get a job at a pet store.
Have a dog, maybe some kids.

412
00:35:57,250 --> 00:35:58,289
Kids!

413
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:01,123
I always wanted kids.

414
00:36:02,875 --> 00:36:05,539
Perhaps you ought to aim
for something a little...

415
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,414
...higher than working in a pet store.

416
00:36:10,041 --> 00:36:14,539
If you like animals, you could become
a veterinarian or a zoologist.

417
00:36:17,666 --> 00:36:20,998
- I'm out of cigarettes.
- Quel dommage!

418
00:36:21,916 --> 00:36:23,539
What does
"quel dommage" mean?

419
00:36:23,666 --> 00:36:25,748
It means you're not getting
any cigarettes.

420
00:37:04,875 --> 00:37:06,581
Are you a boy or a girl?

421
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:11,623
Turn around
and stop bothering people!

422
00:37:17,833 --> 00:37:19,706
Margaret! Thank God!

423
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:22,081
I am in the middle of Arkansas...

424
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:26,539
...and an 8-year-old child
just read me! I can't handle this!

425
00:37:27,291 --> 00:37:33,289
I had to camp out last night
on the ground with bugs!

426
00:37:36,958 --> 00:37:39,289
He is impossible.

427
00:37:39,583 --> 00:37:44,206
I can't throw away all my savings!
My surgery's only 5 days away.

428
00:37:45,916 --> 00:37:48,956
Dallas? I don't know.
4 or 5 hours. Why?

429
00:37:51,416 --> 00:37:52,623
Hold on.

430
00:37:54,375 --> 00:37:57,081
Toby!

431
00:37:57,958 --> 00:38:00,623
Would you mind introducing me
to your new friend?

432
00:38:02,541 --> 00:38:03,664
Taylor.

433
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,914
Yeah, this is Taylor.

434
00:38:07,708 --> 00:38:09,498
It's nice to meet you, Taylor.

435
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:10,998
What's going on here?

436
00:38:11,125 --> 00:38:13,706
Come on! Your mother's waiting
for you in the car!

437
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:17,081
You better watch out he doesn't get
some poor innocent girl in trouble.

438
00:38:17,208 --> 00:38:20,914
You better watch out she doesn't ruin
some poor innocent boy's life!

439
00:38:22,041 --> 00:38:24,414
You, go wait for me at the table!

440
00:38:28,083 --> 00:38:31,998
Margaret! I really don't think
I am cut out to be a mother.

441
00:38:54,041 --> 00:38:56,498
Dear God, bless this meal...

442
00:38:58,083 --> 00:39:02,206
...and please help Toby to find the
strength not to take any more drugs...

443
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:06,581
...so that in L.A. He can get a job
and find a nice apartment.

444
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:09,414
So that even if he never finds
his real father...

445
00:39:09,541 --> 00:39:12,956
...he can lead an independent life.
Amen.

446
00:39:13,541 --> 00:39:14,706
Amen.

447
00:39:17,916 --> 00:39:20,748
There's a really cool hat back there.
It's only $10.

448
00:39:20,916 --> 00:39:22,914
My nose is getting sunburned...

449
00:39:23,708 --> 00:39:25,123
Eat your vegetables.

450
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:31,373
You might wanna use a fork.

451
00:39:32,416 --> 00:39:33,623
Just an idea.

452
00:39:38,166 --> 00:39:39,248
I'II tell you what.

453
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:42,248
You can have that hat
on one condition: No more drugs.

454
00:39:43,166 --> 00:39:44,289
I mean it.

455
00:39:45,333 --> 00:39:46,414
Deal?

456
00:39:47,666 --> 00:39:48,748
Deal.

457
00:40:05,750 --> 00:40:07,039
I got you a present.

458
00:40:07,833 --> 00:40:10,414
Thank you. I'm very... touched.

459
00:40:11,875 --> 00:40:12,998
Put it on!

460
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,248
That looks good.

461
00:40:25,458 --> 00:40:27,164
You get back in here!

462
00:40:28,375 --> 00:40:33,998
Do you have any idea
how dangerous that is?! In! In! In!

463
00:40:34,583 --> 00:40:35,664
Okay!

464
00:40:37,125 --> 00:40:41,164
- Get in! - I was holding on.
You wanna give me a heart attack?

465
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,248
Did I scare you?

466
00:40:53,916 --> 00:40:55,331
Why are we going to Dallas?

467
00:40:56,666 --> 00:41:00,706
An associate of mine has arranged
a place for us to stay for the night.

468
00:41:06,708 --> 00:41:10,998
This Mary Ellen is being very generous
to offer us her hospitality, so...

469
00:41:11,625 --> 00:41:13,914
...I hope you'll be
on your best behavior.

470
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,914
I'm always on my best behavior.

471
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,414
Sabrina and Toby, right?

472
00:41:23,083 --> 00:41:25,123
I'm Mary Ellen. Come on in!

473
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:30,373
I'm having a little get-together, but
you two just make yourselves at home!

474
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:33,498
Mary Ellen, come here!
Alicia's showing us her new vagina!

475
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,164
I'm sorry.
They're feeling a little feisty.

476
00:41:38,875 --> 00:41:43,748
Everybody, this is Sabrina,
and her handsome escort here is Toby.

477
00:41:44,625 --> 00:41:46,414
- Hi!
- Hi yo!

478
00:41:48,125 --> 00:41:49,914
Margaret said you were stealth!

479
00:41:50,166 --> 00:41:53,998
I am, in public.
This is the privacy of my own home!

480
00:41:54,916 --> 00:41:59,206
Welcome to the first meeting
of the Gender Pride President's Day...

481
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:02,331
...Weekend Caribbean Cruise
Planning Committee!

482
00:42:05,166 --> 00:42:07,039
- We have to go.
- No!

483
00:42:07,375 --> 00:42:09,373
Where you guys
know each other from?

484
00:42:09,541 --> 00:42:14,164
We don't. She's a friend
of a friend of a friend...

485
00:42:14,625 --> 00:42:18,248
There's rum punch in the kitchen
and guacamole in the dining room!

486
00:42:18,375 --> 00:42:21,039
- Come on!
- Don't be so uptight. It's a party!

487
00:42:30,958 --> 00:42:34,248
Margaret told me you were planning
to have your surgery soon.

488
00:42:34,666 --> 00:42:36,414
Toby doesn't know about me.

489
00:42:37,375 --> 00:42:38,956
You're stealth to him?!

490
00:42:39,041 --> 00:42:42,373
- Oh, sugar dumpling! - Don't worry,
honey, we've all been there.

491
00:42:42,875 --> 00:42:44,248
I'II pass the word.

492
00:42:46,541 --> 00:42:49,164
It was one of those
instant best friend things.

493
00:42:49,291 --> 00:42:52,539
But at the time we were both straight
men. What could you do with that?

494
00:42:52,666 --> 00:42:54,539
We had our surgery on the same day.

495
00:42:54,958 --> 00:42:57,456
We ended up holding hands
in the recovery room.

496
00:42:57,833 --> 00:43:00,664
And now this gorgeous creature
is the love of my life.

497
00:43:02,875 --> 00:43:06,664
We were telling you friend a bit
about the transsexual lifestyle.

498
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:11,498
Not what you're used to
in church, huh?

499
00:43:12,750 --> 00:43:16,706
These are vaginal dilators.
She just had her surgery last month.

500
00:43:17,250 --> 00:43:21,123
- This is Keanu 2. And this is
Keanu 3. - Where's Keanu 1?

501
00:43:21,500 --> 00:43:24,748
Keanu 1 is in Hollywood filming
a major science fiction epic...

502
00:43:24,916 --> 00:43:27,331
...and we don't wanna hear
a snarky remark about him.

503
00:43:28,541 --> 00:43:31,373
We're not gender-challenged.
We're gender-gifted.

504
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:35,081
I've been woman and I've been man,
and I know more things...

505
00:43:35,208 --> 00:43:37,998
...than you single-sexed people
can even imagine.

506
00:43:39,666 --> 00:43:41,664
Dude, I thought you were a real guy.

507
00:43:43,166 --> 00:43:45,164
We walk among you.

508
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:50,206
That poor thing couldn't pass
on a dark night at 200 yards.

509
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:51,956
In the pink.

510
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,164
You better check your T-dar, honey.
She's a G. G!

511
00:43:57,625 --> 00:44:02,123
- A what?
- A genuine girl... from Mary Kay!

512
00:44:02,916 --> 00:44:06,081
If you let her do a color trial,
she'II give you a free compact.

513
00:44:06,583 --> 00:44:12,664
#Give me a home
where the buffalo roam... #

514
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:17,998
#... and the deer
and the antelope play... #

515
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:19,706
#... with each other. #

516
00:44:19,958 --> 00:44:27,206
#Where seldom is heard
a discouraging word... #

517
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:33,039
#... and the skies
are not cloudy all day. #

518
00:44:33,166 --> 00:44:34,206
Everybody!

519
00:45:04,291 --> 00:45:05,331
Sorry!

520
00:45:09,333 --> 00:45:13,623
Could you hand me my robe, please?
The pink... satin.

521
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,206
It's by the...

522
00:45:16,208 --> 00:45:17,289
Thank you.

523
00:45:26,625 --> 00:45:33,581
It's an unfortunate side-effect
of my... pills. They're a... diuretic.

524
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:36,414
Gross!

525
00:45:37,041 --> 00:45:41,664
A diuretic... It means you go
number 1, not number 2.

526
00:45:42,541 --> 00:45:47,831
Listen, I'm... sorry
about those Ersatz women.

527
00:45:48,041 --> 00:45:49,081
What?

528
00:45:50,583 --> 00:45:56,081
"Ersatz" means phony, something
pretending to be something it's not.

529
00:45:58,583 --> 00:46:00,164
I thought they were nice.

530
00:46:01,875 --> 00:46:04,706
Zoologists are the guys
that work in the zoos, right?

531
00:46:04,875 --> 00:46:06,456
Yes, among other places.

532
00:46:08,541 --> 00:46:11,581
I never met my real dad.
My mom never talked about him.

533
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:15,206
I'm gonna go live with him.
As soon as I get enough money...

534
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:17,456
...I can get some nice clothes...

535
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:20,123
...knock on his door, surprise him.

536
00:46:21,208 --> 00:46:23,498
Do your mom and dad
live in California too?

537
00:46:24,083 --> 00:46:25,998
My parents are dead.

538
00:46:28,333 --> 00:46:29,664
Do you like zoos?

539
00:46:32,416 --> 00:46:34,706
I don't mind the modern ones,
I guess.

540
00:46:36,125 --> 00:46:39,748
The animals... may not be free,
but they're safe.

541
00:46:41,541 --> 00:46:42,664
Yeah.

542
00:46:43,583 --> 00:46:44,706
Me too.

543
00:46:46,041 --> 00:46:50,081
Good night.

544
00:46:56,666 --> 00:46:58,414
- Did you go to a college?
- Yes.

545
00:46:58,541 --> 00:47:00,539
- What did you study?
- A lot of things.

546
00:47:00,666 --> 00:47:05,664
French, cultural anthropology,
archeology, psychology, art history.

547
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:09,081
Possum. Biology.

548
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:12,664
80 million years ago,
during the Cretaceous Period...

549
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,164
...these plains were the floor
of a huge inland sea.

550
00:47:17,625 --> 00:47:18,873
Are we there yet?

551
00:47:19,166 --> 00:47:21,998
If you don't wanna learn anything,
then never mind.

552
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,498
Alright, I'm listening.

553
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:29,706
It cut the entire continent in two.

554
00:47:30,250 --> 00:47:34,456
Dinosaurs lived on either side.
Then, a huge meteor struck the earth.

555
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:37,456
Some say that's why
the dinosaurs went extinct.

556
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:41,123
But why should the insects,
birds and mammals have survived.

557
00:47:43,083 --> 00:47:46,914
- Why? - I don't know. But it's always
seemed a bit fishy to me.

558
00:47:49,083 --> 00:47:52,748
Did you know they found giant shark
remains in the middle of Kansas?

559
00:47:52,916 --> 00:47:56,664
- How big were they? - Big enough
to swallow you without even chewing.

560
00:48:14,208 --> 00:48:16,081
- Got you.
- You did not.

561
00:48:19,541 --> 00:48:20,581
I got you!

562
00:48:22,833 --> 00:48:25,373
- You got me in the eye!
- I'm so sorry!

563
00:48:25,583 --> 00:48:26,831
Did I hurt you?

564
00:48:27,583 --> 00:48:28,664
Got you!

565
00:48:31,875 --> 00:48:32,914
Stop it!

566
00:48:35,291 --> 00:48:36,956
Seriously, watch the road!

567
00:48:37,916 --> 00:48:42,123
You drive. I hope we pass a rest stop
soon. My diuretic's kicking in.

568
00:48:52,875 --> 00:48:54,998
Do rattlesnakes come out at night?

569
00:49:43,083 --> 00:49:44,123
Well...

570
00:49:46,166 --> 00:49:47,914
...I must say that's a relief.

571
00:49:50,666 --> 00:49:51,998
Something wrong?

572
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:12,414
This is a no smoking room.

573
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,664
New Mexico is the ufology capital
of the world.

574
00:50:31,750 --> 00:50:36,998
Ufology, from UFO, the study
of unidentified flying objects.

575
00:50:39,541 --> 00:50:42,539
Social ostracism
doesn't work in a community of two.

576
00:50:45,875 --> 00:50:47,581
Damn it, Toby, say something!

577
00:50:48,666 --> 00:50:50,373
I wanna go to Sammy's Wigwam.

578
00:50:57,416 --> 00:51:00,289
Here are some arrowheads.
They're only a dollar each.

579
00:51:03,708 --> 00:51:05,581
He's been acting like that all day.

580
00:51:09,875 --> 00:51:12,498
Young man, if you don't behave
in a civilized fashion...

581
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:15,706
...you and I are gonna have
a very serious problem. - Fuck you!

582
00:51:16,375 --> 00:51:18,248
You watch your mouth
around your mother!

583
00:51:18,375 --> 00:51:20,498
She is not my mother!
She's not anyone's mother!

584
00:51:20,625 --> 00:51:22,873
She's not even a real woman.
She's got a dick.

585
00:51:23,875 --> 00:51:24,956
Don't you?

586
00:51:25,958 --> 00:51:27,623
Don't you? Go on, tell him!

587
00:51:34,750 --> 00:51:36,414
You're a fucking lying freak!

588
00:51:41,625 --> 00:51:43,248
What do you want out of me?

589
00:51:43,416 --> 00:51:47,373
Just because a person doesn't blab
around her biological history...

590
00:51:47,500 --> 00:51:49,998
...to everyone she meets
doesn't make her a liar.

591
00:51:50,083 --> 00:51:51,748
Why didn't you tell me the truth?

592
00:51:51,916 --> 00:51:54,664
So you could humiliate me
in public even sooner?

593
00:51:54,916 --> 00:51:56,289
You knew all about me!

594
00:52:03,375 --> 00:52:05,206
Why did you bail me out ofjail?

595
00:52:05,833 --> 00:52:08,998
You just walked into jail
and asked them who needed help?

596
00:52:11,625 --> 00:52:15,081
You know what? Fuck you!
I never heard of a trannie church!

597
00:52:15,208 --> 00:52:17,123
Just drop me off in the next town.

598
00:52:20,458 --> 00:52:23,623
So you don't think I have the right
to belong to a church?

599
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:27,998
My body may be a work in progress...

600
00:52:28,083 --> 00:52:30,456
...but there is nothing wrong
with my soul!

601
00:52:31,541 --> 00:52:36,581
Jesus made me this way so I could
suffer and be reborn the way he was.

602
00:52:38,833 --> 00:52:42,206
- So you're cutting your dick off
for Jesus? - You don't cut it off.

603
00:52:42,375 --> 00:52:44,748
I'm just gonna have an innie
instead of an outie.

604
00:52:46,083 --> 00:52:49,956
Hi. Is there any chance that you could
offer a fellow traveler a ride?

605
00:52:50,833 --> 00:52:53,414
Absolutely!
We love helping strangers!

606
00:53:00,333 --> 00:53:01,456
Beef, jerky?

607
00:53:01,833 --> 00:53:03,914
No, thanks. I'm a level 4 vegan.

608
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,331
I don't eat anything
that casts a shadow.

609
00:53:07,750 --> 00:53:10,914
- A little token of my appreciation?
- Absolutely.

610
00:53:21,125 --> 00:53:24,831
I'm sorry, but the secondary smoke
might render me unfit to drive.

611
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:27,498
She's cool, right?

612
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,081
She's not a she. She's got a dick.

613
00:53:31,208 --> 00:53:33,289
- Toby!
- For now at least.

614
00:53:34,333 --> 00:53:35,414
You're a guy?

615
00:53:38,125 --> 00:53:41,123
- I'm a transsexual woman.
- Wow!

616
00:53:41,875 --> 00:53:45,206
I think transsexuality
is a radically evolved state of being.

617
00:53:47,583 --> 00:53:48,706
Hey, look!

618
00:53:51,083 --> 00:53:54,498
Many societies throughout history
have honored and revered...

619
00:53:54,625 --> 00:53:57,873
...transgendered people:
The Zulu, the Yoruba...

620
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:01,081
The Native Americans
called us "two-spirit people".

621
00:54:01,291 --> 00:54:02,831
Two spirits. Cool!

622
00:54:03,458 --> 00:54:05,998
Tell him what they're gonna do
with your dick!

623
00:54:07,041 --> 00:54:10,039
Then the settlers came
and tended to murder us on sight.

624
00:54:10,166 --> 00:54:13,914
The way the white man treated
the Indian was very deeply fucked up.

625
00:54:14,166 --> 00:54:16,414
- Yeah.
- Are you sure you won't join us?

626
00:54:16,875 --> 00:54:19,081
Come on! We know what you've got!

627
00:54:19,458 --> 00:54:21,206
You boys go ahead. Have fun.

628
00:54:31,666 --> 00:54:34,873
So what do you do when you're not
following the open road?

629
00:54:36,166 --> 00:54:38,831
- I'm a peyote shaman.
- How do you do that?

630
00:54:40,750 --> 00:54:43,581
It involves consuming
majestic amounts of peyote.

631
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:45,748
And when you're done throwing up...

632
00:54:46,125 --> 00:54:47,456
...you see things.

633
00:54:50,583 --> 00:54:54,456
- What things?
- Once I saw my own death.

634
00:54:54,958 --> 00:54:57,456
Do you by any chance
drown in a desert lake?

635
00:54:58,250 --> 00:55:03,414
No. I die in a depressurization
accident on a moon colony.

636
00:55:04,083 --> 00:55:06,581
I'II show you something.
It's in my bag.

637
00:55:14,916 --> 00:55:17,998
Do you still think what you said
back at Sammy's wigwam?

638
00:55:18,208 --> 00:55:19,373
What?

639
00:55:22,125 --> 00:55:23,414
That I'm a freak.

640
00:55:27,083 --> 00:55:28,331
You're not a freak.

641
00:55:29,250 --> 00:55:30,623
You're just a liar.

642
00:55:40,875 --> 00:55:42,039
Oh, shit!

643
00:55:42,541 --> 00:55:43,664
My purse!

644
00:55:44,833 --> 00:55:47,914
My hormones!
You dirty motherfucking hippie!

645
00:55:51,000 --> 00:55:52,873
My dog book was in that car.

646
00:55:58,541 --> 00:56:01,623
Oh, God...
Oh, God... Oh, God...

647
00:56:02,916 --> 00:56:04,248
My surgery...

648
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:12,498
I have to be in L.A. In 2 days.
What are we going to do?

649
00:56:20,541 --> 00:56:22,998
- Is it soothing?
- I could sell it.

650
00:56:23,583 --> 00:56:24,998
How much could you get?

651
00:56:34,208 --> 00:56:35,581
Come on! Let's go!

652
00:57:56,625 --> 00:57:57,831
Having a tough day?

653
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,456
I don't care about the car.

654
00:58:14,583 --> 00:58:17,039
I just need to get to L.A.
As quickly as possible.

655
00:58:17,708 --> 00:58:21,706
I'm driving a couple of ponies over
to the sale in Show Low next morning.

656
00:58:22,083 --> 00:58:23,998
I could give you a ride that far.

657
00:58:26,708 --> 00:58:29,998
- Woodrow, can I get a burger
for the young lady here? - Yep!

658
00:58:53,541 --> 00:58:57,998
- Isn't Calvin an unusual name
for a Native American? - Not really.

659
00:58:58,083 --> 00:59:01,123
My brothers are named Dwight, Lloyd,
Darryl and Woodrow.

660
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:07,248
- What's your last name?
- Manygoats.

661
00:59:07,625 --> 00:59:11,456
- It's my mother's clan name.
- A matrilineal kinship system!

662
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:18,539
- Is there a Mrs. Manygoats?
- No. Not yet.

663
00:59:19,458 --> 00:59:21,623
I guess the right woman
hasn't met me.

664
00:59:24,000 --> 00:59:25,039
There you are!

665
00:59:26,041 --> 00:59:29,664
Calvin, I'd like you to meet Toby.
Toby, this is Calvin Manygoats.

666
00:59:29,833 --> 00:59:30,998
How're you doing, son?

667
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,748
I saved you half a hamburger.

668
00:59:34,458 --> 00:59:37,664
Calvin's offered us a place
for tonight and a ride in the morning.

669
00:59:37,833 --> 00:59:40,581
- Isn't that generous of him?
- I guess.

670
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:44,539
Excuse me, just a minute.

671
00:59:51,583 --> 00:59:54,164
You... already found a buyer?

672
00:59:56,875 --> 00:59:59,748
At least now you don't have
any more of that damn drug.

673
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:04,998
Shower.

674
01:00:06,583 --> 01:00:07,664
So...

675
01:00:10,208 --> 01:00:15,581
...Calvin, have you... spent all
your life in New Mexico? - Not yet!

676
01:00:25,833 --> 01:00:28,373
- It's beautiful.
- It's home!

677
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:54,539
Hi.

678
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:02,414
It's Mescal.

679
01:01:03,458 --> 01:01:06,331
A friend of mine brings it up
from Oaxaca.

680
01:01:14,500 --> 01:01:18,414
#Beautiful dreamer,
wake unto me... #

681
01:01:18,708 --> 01:01:22,831
#... starlight and dewdrops
are waiting for thee. #

682
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:28,289
#Sounds of the rude world
heard in the day... #

683
01:01:29,416 --> 01:01:34,206
#... lulled by the moonlight
have all passed away. #

684
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:41,831
#Beautiful dreamer,
queen of my song... #

685
01:01:42,250 --> 01:01:47,206
#... list while I woo thee
with soft melody. #

686
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:53,123
#Gone are the cares
of life's busy throng... #

687
01:01:53,541 --> 01:01:58,123
#... beautiful dreamer
awake unto me. #

688
01:01:58,541 --> 01:02:05,123
#Beautiful dreamer,
awake unto me. #

689
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,248
You can sing!

690
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:13,706
Just enough to keep the dogs off
the back porch! That's all.

691
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:17,081
Come on.

692
01:02:19,875 --> 01:02:20,914
Thank you.

693
01:02:30,583 --> 01:02:33,331
- That'II put hair on your chest.
- I hope not!

694
01:02:56,208 --> 01:02:57,623
Good morning, sleepy head.

695
01:02:58,500 --> 01:03:01,039
Calvin's gonna drive us
all the way to Phoenix.

696
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:05,414
Do my breasts seem smaller to you?

697
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:08,206
I've missed 2 doses of my pills.

698
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:12,289
Play with the body's hormonal balance
and you're playing with fire.

699
01:03:14,000 --> 01:03:17,081
Playing with fire!
Playing with fire!

700
01:03:26,166 --> 01:03:28,748
When you wear your cowboy hat,
if you wear it like that...

701
01:03:28,916 --> 01:03:30,581
...that means
you're looking for trouble.

702
01:03:30,708 --> 01:03:33,248
If you wear it like that,
you're not looking for trouble.

703
01:03:33,708 --> 01:03:36,831
If you wear it off to the side,
you're out to impress the ladies!

704
01:03:38,583 --> 01:03:40,456
How come an Indian
wears a cowboy hat?

705
01:03:41,125 --> 01:03:45,289
It keeps the sun out of my eyes better
than a headband and 2 eagle feathers.

706
01:03:46,166 --> 01:03:48,706
Calvin was telling me
that his people are Navajo.

707
01:03:48,875 --> 01:03:52,914
Only part Navajo. My great-great-great
grandfather was Zuni.

708
01:03:55,291 --> 01:03:57,206
You got a Cherokee look about you.

709
01:03:58,083 --> 01:03:59,748
Proud people, them Cherokee!

710
01:04:22,875 --> 01:04:26,331
- You're too young.
- No, I'm not. - Yes, you are.

711
01:04:26,541 --> 01:04:28,873
Here. Drink some water.

712
01:04:32,958 --> 01:04:36,748
Now if you gentlemen will excuse me,
I have to... use the powder room.

713
01:04:40,291 --> 01:04:42,373
- Here.
- Thank you. - Allow me.

714
01:04:43,125 --> 01:04:44,164
Thank you.

715
01:04:51,541 --> 01:04:54,248
There are things about her
she's not telling you.

716
01:04:54,541 --> 01:04:58,664
Every woman has a right
to a little mystery, dude!

717
01:05:00,166 --> 01:05:03,998
You know she's a Jesus freak?
She's probably waiting to convert you.

718
01:05:05,125 --> 01:05:07,456
She can convert me
anytime she wants to.

719
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:39,164
I wish I could drive you
all the way to Los Angeles.

720
01:05:39,333 --> 01:05:40,456
So do I.

721
01:05:41,291 --> 01:05:42,956
Let me get that for you.

722
01:05:43,958 --> 01:05:44,998
It's alright.

723
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:47,456
It doesn't work from the inside.

724
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:50,289
It sticks a bit.

725
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:52,623
Thank you.

726
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:58,498
Bree, there are some things about me,
about my past that you don't know.

727
01:05:59,333 --> 01:06:00,831
We all have our secrets.

728
01:06:03,416 --> 01:06:06,456
I've been in jail more than once.
I'm about blind in one eye...

729
01:06:06,583 --> 01:06:09,206
...and I got half a pound of shrapnel
in my left leg.

730
01:06:09,458 --> 01:06:11,664
But, if you're ever in New Mexico...

731
01:06:12,458 --> 01:06:14,748
...I'd really like it
if you gave me a call.

732
01:06:15,875 --> 01:06:17,623
Thank you, Calvin. I'll do that.

733
01:06:18,416 --> 01:06:19,498
Let's go!

734
01:06:21,666 --> 01:06:22,831
Come here!

735
01:06:29,375 --> 01:06:31,873
This belonged
to a real good friend of mine.

736
01:06:32,125 --> 01:06:34,914
He was a champion
in the All Indian Rodeo circuit.

737
01:06:35,083 --> 01:06:36,748
Now you look like a warrior.

738
01:06:37,666 --> 01:06:38,998
Ma'am...

739
01:06:51,333 --> 01:06:54,414
- Where are we?
- My parents' house.

740
01:06:55,541 --> 01:06:59,206
- I thought you said your parents
were dead. - Wishful thinking.

741
01:07:01,458 --> 01:07:03,831
- Who's Sydney?
- My baby sister.

742
01:07:14,291 --> 01:07:15,581
May I help you?

743
01:07:16,333 --> 01:07:17,456
Is Sydney here?

744
01:07:19,375 --> 01:07:22,123
Sydney's out.
May I tell her who called?

745
01:07:22,708 --> 01:07:23,998
I don't think so.

746
01:07:37,625 --> 01:07:39,331
Don't look at me that way.

747
01:07:40,458 --> 01:07:41,998
I'm not looking at you.

748
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:48,456
Alright, alright. Shit!

749
01:07:49,833 --> 01:07:52,498
I mean darn. No, I mean shit.

750
01:08:01,458 --> 01:08:03,123
May I help you, young lady?

751
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:05,998
Dad, it's me.

752
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:16,082
Mom! Dad!

753
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,039
Mom!

754
01:08:21,707 --> 01:08:24,123
Get in here,
before the neighbors see you!

755
01:08:27,541 --> 01:08:29,623
Jesus Christ!
I can't even recognize you.

756
01:08:29,832 --> 01:08:32,457
It's me... only different.

757
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,582
So you've done it. It's all over.

758
01:08:36,916 --> 01:08:38,914
I don't think
that's any of your business.

759
01:08:40,000 --> 01:08:41,039
Mom!

760
01:08:41,707 --> 01:08:43,873
Thank God! Murray, he's still a boy.

761
01:08:53,707 --> 01:08:57,039
My poor Stanley!
I can't look at you like this!

762
01:08:57,707 --> 01:08:59,832
Why do you always upset her
like that?

763
01:09:02,666 --> 01:09:05,957
I'm just gonna get
something to eat and drink...

764
01:09:06,041 --> 01:09:08,539
...then I'll go back
and wait for Sydney outside.

765
01:09:15,416 --> 01:09:17,457
Are you sure you're alright,
Stanley?

766
01:09:18,375 --> 01:09:20,373
Fabulous. Never been better.

767
01:09:21,332 --> 01:09:23,082
- Stanley...
- Bree!

768
01:09:24,541 --> 01:09:27,039
Sabrina Claire Osborne.

769
01:09:28,375 --> 01:09:30,539
We're gonna need more time
with that.

770
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,248
- Your mother and I love you...
- But we don't respect you.

771
01:09:35,207 --> 01:09:37,582
I'II never understand
why you're doing this to me.

772
01:09:37,750 --> 01:09:39,457
I'm not doing anything to you.

773
01:09:39,582 --> 01:09:42,248
I'm gender dysphoric.
It's a genetic condition.

774
01:09:42,875 --> 01:09:45,539
Don't try to blame
your father and me for this!

775
01:09:45,707 --> 01:09:49,998
Don't use so much mayonnaise. Are you
trying to give yourself a heart attack?

776
01:09:51,916 --> 01:09:53,498
Let me do that!

777
01:09:55,332 --> 01:09:57,457
Do you know what I see
when I look at you?

778
01:09:57,916 --> 01:10:00,998
I see a lost soul
crying out for help.

779
01:10:02,332 --> 01:10:05,914
This would never have happened
if you had only come to church...

780
01:10:06,000 --> 01:10:10,373
...as a child instead of going off
to that synagogue of your father's!

781
01:10:10,500 --> 01:10:11,664
Mom! Dad!

782
01:10:12,166 --> 01:10:14,707
There's a sort of scruffy
looking kid outside.

783
01:10:17,041 --> 01:10:20,164
- Holy shit!
- Language, Sydney!

784
01:10:20,375 --> 01:10:22,164
I don't fucking believe it!

785
01:10:23,041 --> 01:10:24,207
Stanley!

786
01:10:25,875 --> 01:10:26,914
Bree.

787
01:10:29,416 --> 01:10:30,539
Bree...

788
01:10:31,332 --> 01:10:33,707
Well, Bree,
I was hoping you'd show up...

789
01:10:33,875 --> 01:10:35,707
...take some of the heat off me.

790
01:10:37,125 --> 01:10:38,498
It's nice to see you too.

791
01:10:38,625 --> 01:10:41,664
If the kid out there's your boyfriend,
I'm gonna slit my wrists.

792
01:10:41,832 --> 01:10:44,914
- I need to talk to you in private.
- Oh, my God! He is!

793
01:10:45,000 --> 01:10:48,207
You lucky son of a...
I mean, you lucky bitch!

794
01:10:48,375 --> 01:10:49,664
Your boyfriend?!

795
01:10:50,166 --> 01:10:54,664
That filthy teenage juvenile
delinquent who came to the door?

796
01:10:54,832 --> 01:10:57,914
He happens to be a clean, healthy
and respectable young man.

797
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,873
I don't want to hear
any more about it! How old is he?

798
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:03,832
17.

799
01:11:04,457 --> 01:11:07,414
Oh, my God! Murray, he's underage!

800
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,289
Mom, he's my son.

801
01:11:13,041 --> 01:11:16,207
- You're shitting me?
- Remember Emma Wilkins?

802
01:11:17,082 --> 01:11:20,123
- What are you saying?
- Is Emma here too?

803
01:11:20,832 --> 01:11:22,164
She killed herself.

804
01:11:22,832 --> 01:11:25,539
Jesus! Kinehora!

805
01:11:25,957 --> 01:11:27,457
Are you trying to tell me...

806
01:11:28,541 --> 01:11:31,123
...that that boy
who came to the door...

807
01:11:32,457 --> 01:11:33,748
He's your grandson.

808
01:11:34,916 --> 01:11:40,832
My grandson...

809
01:11:42,957 --> 01:11:44,082
Dear God!

810
01:11:45,957 --> 01:11:48,582
He doesn't know anything
and I don't want him to.

811
01:11:50,375 --> 01:11:51,414
Wait!

812
01:11:53,750 --> 01:11:55,039
Call me grandpa.

813
01:12:00,666 --> 01:12:05,123
You poor thing!
Get up off that filthy ground!

814
01:12:05,582 --> 01:12:08,373
There could be all sorts
of awful things down there.

815
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:10,289
Look at you!

816
01:12:11,582 --> 01:12:13,582
A handsome boy!

817
01:12:15,125 --> 01:12:19,748
- Do you know who I am? I'm your...
- You're a friend of Bree's mother.

818
01:12:19,916 --> 01:12:23,248
He doesn't know about me.
And I don't want him to know about me.

819
01:12:23,375 --> 01:12:26,164
- Agreed?! You're not gonna say
anything? - No.

820
01:12:27,375 --> 01:12:29,832
- Hi there. I'm Sydney.
- Hey.

821
01:12:30,707 --> 01:12:31,832
Toby.

822
01:12:32,375 --> 01:12:33,582
What do you say?

823
01:12:34,207 --> 01:12:38,832
Toby! Come on inside,
where there's nice air conditioning.

824
01:12:39,000 --> 01:12:43,332
Come on, honey!
I'II make you a nice plate of food!

825
01:12:48,332 --> 01:12:50,039
Defrosted to perfection!

826
01:12:51,082 --> 01:12:53,998
- Finish your vegetables.
- He doesn't like broccoli.

827
01:12:55,957 --> 01:12:57,082
Open up.

828
01:13:00,082 --> 01:13:01,289
Lucky, no!

829
01:13:02,875 --> 01:13:04,457
That dog's a sex maniac!

830
01:13:06,250 --> 01:13:07,664
Just like your father.

831
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,164
At least he gets more action
than I do.

832
01:13:10,375 --> 01:13:13,082
My mom used to live in Phoenix
before I was born.

833
01:13:13,832 --> 01:13:14,914
Really?

834
01:13:15,916 --> 01:13:17,082
What a coincidence!

835
01:13:17,207 --> 01:13:19,914
What'd your name used to be,
when you were a guy?

836
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:24,998
Honey, why don't you go
and watch TV in the spare bedroom?

837
01:13:26,207 --> 01:13:27,623
You can take the dog.

838
01:13:30,832 --> 01:13:32,248
Come here, boy.

839
01:13:34,916 --> 01:13:38,582
Stanley, what are you planning to do
with that poor boy?

840
01:13:40,832 --> 01:13:44,873
First of all, I'm gonna make sure he
knows he's encouraged and supported.

841
01:13:47,750 --> 01:13:49,332
And that he's respected...

842
01:13:50,291 --> 01:13:51,373
...maybe even...

843
01:13:52,625 --> 01:13:54,373
At least that he's respected.

844
01:14:00,832 --> 01:14:03,123
Behold the return
of the prodigal son!

845
01:14:05,125 --> 01:14:07,539
Can we try to be nice
to each other, please?

846
01:14:08,541 --> 01:14:12,748
This is so bizarre.
I can still see Stanley in you, but...

847
01:14:13,332 --> 01:14:15,248
...it's like
you put yourself through a strainer...

848
01:14:15,375 --> 01:14:17,123
...and got rid of all the boy pulp.

849
01:14:21,332 --> 01:14:23,582
Planning a game of bridge
with the girls?

850
01:14:31,416 --> 01:14:33,082
Can I borrow 1,000 dollars?

851
01:14:33,707 --> 01:14:35,289
You've got to be kidding.

852
01:14:36,541 --> 01:14:37,748
500?

853
01:14:38,541 --> 01:14:41,207
- 250?
- Do I hear a dollar and a half?

854
01:14:42,416 --> 01:14:44,248
I have to account for every penny!

855
01:14:44,957 --> 01:14:48,332
18 months sober and they're still
scared shitless I'm gonna relapse...

856
01:14:48,457 --> 01:14:52,539
...and wind up passed out on the floor
bed in some dive down on Van Buren.

857
01:14:53,625 --> 01:14:55,248
God, those were the days!

858
01:14:56,875 --> 01:14:58,998
My surgery's the day after tomorrow.

859
01:15:00,500 --> 01:15:02,207
I need airfare to get home.

860
01:15:06,750 --> 01:15:09,582
Growing up I always thought
you were the lucky one.

861
01:15:12,541 --> 01:15:13,832
Try this one!

862
01:15:14,666 --> 01:15:15,707
Oh, my God!

863
01:15:15,957 --> 01:15:18,957
No, it'II be like
"Showgirls" and "Ice Capades".

864
01:15:19,375 --> 01:15:21,623
I'm a transsexual,
not a transvestite.

865
01:15:21,750 --> 01:15:23,832
Yeah, but it'll really freak Mom out!

866
01:15:24,625 --> 01:15:26,623
I've lost all credibility now.

867
01:15:55,416 --> 01:15:59,123
Toby, don't break that, honey.
It's very expensive.

868
01:16:01,166 --> 01:16:04,914
Murray, I just hate
the way you had Lucky's tail clipped!

869
01:16:05,166 --> 01:16:07,998
It stands straight up like that,
just like a penis.

870
01:16:08,457 --> 01:16:10,623
- Black and hairy?
- Well, it does!

871
01:16:10,916 --> 01:16:14,082
- Not like any penis I've ever seen!
- Me neither.

872
01:16:14,750 --> 01:16:16,082
Toby!

873
01:16:16,707 --> 01:16:19,748
Toby, come over here
and let me fix your hair. Come on!

874
01:16:20,541 --> 01:16:21,998
Come on, honey!

875
01:16:24,332 --> 01:16:25,373
Stay!

876
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:26,998
Sit!

877
01:16:28,291 --> 01:16:31,707
You have such nice thick hair!

878
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:33,539
Just like mine.

879
01:16:34,375 --> 01:16:37,248
And those clothes
are a great improvement.

880
01:16:37,750 --> 01:16:40,914
- They fit good, huh?
- They fit well!

881
01:16:41,166 --> 01:16:42,414
Grammar police!

882
01:16:43,582 --> 01:16:44,707
Good evening.

883
01:16:52,375 --> 01:16:54,957
That dress looks
perfectly ridiculous.

884
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:08,873
You're looking very handsome.

885
01:17:10,166 --> 01:17:11,498
You look good too.

886
01:17:12,125 --> 01:17:14,873
- Beauty is relative.
- For God's sake, Mom!

887
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,623
Don't pick on me, not tonight!
I can't take it!

888
01:17:26,332 --> 01:17:30,748
I used to read pornography
on the toilet and ever since...

889
01:17:31,750 --> 01:17:33,164
...I have shitty sex.

890
01:17:36,332 --> 01:17:37,914
- You get it?
- Yeah...

891
01:17:53,041 --> 01:17:54,039
Thank you.

892
01:17:56,916 --> 01:17:59,164
Toby, come and sit here next to me!

893
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:01,164
Here, take a picture!

894
01:18:02,207 --> 01:18:05,039
Murray, scoot over!
Come on, honey, right here!

895
01:18:06,625 --> 01:18:08,998
That's right.
Toby, honey, lean in place.

896
01:18:09,416 --> 01:18:12,582
Alright, everybody,
1, 2, 3...

897
01:18:15,625 --> 01:18:18,082
We all look much happier
than we really are.

898
01:18:19,375 --> 01:18:21,164
Can you take one
of the two of us?

899
01:18:22,832 --> 01:18:23,957
I'II take it.

900
01:18:38,625 --> 01:18:41,498
Nice to see a young man
being so polite to his mother.

901
01:18:43,332 --> 01:18:44,914
That's not his mother.

902
01:18:51,625 --> 01:18:54,832
And a hamburger for the young
gentleman. Enjoy your meal!

903
01:19:02,875 --> 01:19:04,957
Toby, do you want to say grace?

904
01:19:05,625 --> 01:19:07,539
Go ahead, honey! Don't be shy!

905
01:19:16,957 --> 01:19:19,748
God bless this restaurant...

906
01:19:20,375 --> 01:19:25,039
...and... these thy gifts
that we are about to receive forever...

907
01:19:25,582 --> 01:19:26,914
...and ever.

908
01:19:27,457 --> 01:19:30,332
And thank you, Lord,
for bringing Toby to us.

909
01:19:31,500 --> 01:19:35,832
And, please, let us all stay together
in health and spirits...

910
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:38,832
...in Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
- Amen.

911
01:19:39,207 --> 01:19:40,457
Shalom Yisrael.

912
01:19:48,750 --> 01:19:51,998
Toby, honey, don't take
the lettuce out of your hamburger.

913
01:19:52,166 --> 01:19:53,457
It's good for you.

914
01:19:55,832 --> 01:19:57,914
Sydney, don't play with your food!

915
01:19:58,582 --> 01:19:59,998
Sieg heil!

916
01:20:08,375 --> 01:20:13,998
- Can I borrow 1,000 dollars?
- Toby, your hamburger's almost raw!

917
01:20:14,125 --> 01:20:17,373
- Let me send that back.
- I can pay it back with interest.

918
01:20:18,207 --> 01:20:21,748
- What do you need the money for?
- To get back to L.A.

919
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:23,248
Look at your life.

920
01:20:23,666 --> 01:20:26,164
You've never been able
to stick to a decision.

921
01:20:26,375 --> 01:20:29,082
10 years of college
and not a single degree.

922
01:20:29,332 --> 01:20:31,998
How do you know
you won't change your mind?

923
01:20:36,625 --> 01:20:37,832
Because I know.

924
01:20:41,041 --> 01:20:43,957
Don't do this awful thing
to yourself, please!

925
01:20:45,916 --> 01:20:47,498
I miss my son.

926
01:20:50,207 --> 01:20:51,289
Mom...

927
01:20:52,832 --> 01:20:54,289
...you never had a son.

928
01:20:57,416 --> 01:20:59,498
How can you say such a thing?

929
01:21:00,166 --> 01:21:03,539
Now you know how I felt when you hired
those private detectives.

930
01:21:03,875 --> 01:21:06,082
We only tried to do the best for you.

931
01:21:06,500 --> 01:21:08,414
Is that why you tried
to have me committed?

932
01:21:08,541 --> 01:21:09,873
You tried to kill yourself!

933
01:21:10,000 --> 01:21:11,539
Because you tried
to have me committed!

934
01:21:11,666 --> 01:21:13,457
I don't know why you have
to be so emotional.

935
01:21:13,582 --> 01:21:14,748
I am not emotional!

936
01:21:16,625 --> 01:21:19,998
- God, my cycle's all out of whack!
- You don't have cycles!

937
01:21:22,666 --> 01:21:24,207
Hormones are hormones.

938
01:21:24,832 --> 01:21:27,914
Yours and mine just happen
to come in little purple pills.

939
01:21:29,082 --> 01:21:32,623
- Young man! May we get some doggie
bags here, please? - Yes, ma'am.

940
01:21:32,750 --> 01:21:35,623
I am going to finish
cooking his hamburger at home!

941
01:21:38,000 --> 01:21:39,957
Murray, give me your wallet!

942
01:21:46,500 --> 01:21:49,498
Here's 200 dollars.
We'll get the rest out of the safe.

943
01:21:51,000 --> 01:21:52,414
There's one condition.

944
01:21:53,082 --> 01:21:55,123
I want Toby to stay here with me.

945
01:21:56,707 --> 01:21:58,414
Wouldn't you like that, honey?

946
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,248
You could have
your own little apartment.

947
01:22:02,457 --> 01:22:04,582
We'll remodel the guest house!

948
01:22:05,125 --> 01:22:10,332
Do you like to play tennis? We have
8 new courts at the Country Club.

949
01:22:10,916 --> 01:22:15,164
Murray and I just feel that
you need a stable, loving family...

950
01:22:15,666 --> 01:22:19,373
...with the means to give you
every chance that you deserve.

951
01:22:31,082 --> 01:22:33,748
Toby! There you are, baby!

952
01:22:52,541 --> 01:22:54,914
Half Italian villa,
half Country Club.

953
01:22:59,125 --> 01:23:02,082
- Beauty is relative.
- Not my relatives!

954
01:23:03,957 --> 01:23:07,664
I wish just once they'd look at me
and see me.

955
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:12,248
That's all.
Just really see me.

956
01:23:13,832 --> 01:23:16,582
Why are they being so nice to me?

957
01:23:21,166 --> 01:23:23,039
You think I ought to stay here?

958
01:23:24,125 --> 01:23:25,498
Do you want to?

959
01:23:28,332 --> 01:23:29,664
It's pretty nice.

960
01:23:31,916 --> 01:23:35,164
I think you ought to do
whatever you think is best for you.

961
01:23:37,957 --> 01:23:39,248
But if you want...

962
01:23:43,457 --> 01:23:45,289
...you can come and live with me.

963
01:23:47,416 --> 01:23:51,582
I can't give you anything like this,
but I'm sure we can manage something.

964
01:23:53,416 --> 01:23:55,457
Did you really try to kill yourself?

965
01:23:56,416 --> 01:23:58,832
I swallowed
half a bottle of Nembutal.

966
01:24:02,125 --> 01:24:04,414
Then I panicked and called 911.

967
01:24:08,082 --> 01:24:10,998
- Maybe you're not the suicidal type.
- Maybe.

968
01:24:13,125 --> 01:24:17,164
Unless my mother is right
and I just can't stick to a decision.

969
01:24:27,125 --> 01:24:28,248
Come in.

970
01:24:33,625 --> 01:24:36,039
- Can't you sleep?
- Not really.

971
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:38,082
Do you need something?

972
01:24:38,582 --> 01:24:40,873
- A glass of milk?
- No.

973
01:24:43,707 --> 01:24:45,039
What is it?

974
01:24:46,375 --> 01:24:47,832
I must look awful.

975
01:24:49,000 --> 01:24:50,248
You look good.

976
01:24:55,666 --> 01:24:57,123
You look well.

977
01:25:03,000 --> 01:25:04,332
Don't worry.

978
01:25:09,750 --> 01:25:11,539
What are you doing?

979
01:25:12,416 --> 01:25:13,664
What I'm good at.

980
01:25:16,082 --> 01:25:19,123
- No! No!
- It's okay. I want to.

981
01:25:20,707 --> 01:25:22,289
You'II like it, I promise.

982
01:25:22,500 --> 01:25:25,164
I don't wanna like it.
I don't wanna it at all.

983
01:25:27,416 --> 01:25:28,498
Okay.

984
01:25:34,416 --> 01:25:36,082
I'II marry you if you want.

985
01:25:37,000 --> 01:25:40,373
I don't care how big your place is.
I just wanna be with you.

986
01:25:43,332 --> 01:25:44,957
I think you're sexy, Bree.

987
01:25:47,082 --> 01:25:51,207
It's like... I can see you.

988
01:25:54,166 --> 01:25:55,457
Oh, God.

989
01:26:01,750 --> 01:26:05,914
Oh, no. Put your clothes on.
I mean it. Right now. Stop it.

990
01:26:06,000 --> 01:26:09,539
- What's the matter? - Would you
please just cover yourself up?!

991
01:26:17,916 --> 01:26:20,498
- I am such a total shit.
- No, you're not.

992
01:26:23,082 --> 01:26:25,664
There's something I should have told
you a long time ago.

993
01:26:25,832 --> 01:26:27,164
You're gonna hate me.

994
01:26:29,082 --> 01:26:32,998
I'm not really... exactly...

995
01:26:36,082 --> 01:26:37,998
...affiliated with the church.

996
01:26:40,666 --> 01:26:42,332
I already figured that out.

997
01:26:47,875 --> 01:26:48,914
What?

998
01:26:50,332 --> 01:26:51,707
It's my mom and dad.

999
01:26:52,707 --> 01:26:54,082
It's your mom...

1000
01:26:56,125 --> 01:26:57,248
...and me.

1001
01:27:02,000 --> 01:27:03,123
Toby...

1002
01:27:07,332 --> 01:27:08,914
...I'm so sorry.

1003
01:27:10,166 --> 01:27:14,164
I know I shouldn't have lied to you.
I know how disappointed you must be...

1004
01:27:14,291 --> 01:27:17,164
...your one bedroom apartment
instead of a mansion...

1005
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,164
...half Jewish
instead of half Indian.

1006
01:27:21,416 --> 01:27:25,457
Toby!

1007
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,832
Why don't we look on the bright side?
We've gotten to know each other...

1008
01:27:29,957 --> 01:27:33,998
...our strengths and weaknesses. And
we're still good friends. Aren't we?

1009
01:27:34,875 --> 01:27:39,039
I'm so sorry! I truly...
Really I didn't mean to hurt you!

1010
01:27:39,166 --> 01:27:41,707
My mother's probably right.
I'm a terrible influence.

1011
01:27:41,875 --> 01:27:45,498
Please, this is a terrible time
for me. I should be... Toby, wait!

1012
01:27:47,416 --> 01:27:48,873
You are not my father!

1013
01:27:49,332 --> 01:27:50,539
Oh, God!

1014
01:27:51,125 --> 01:27:52,207
Honey...

1015
01:27:52,541 --> 01:27:53,582
There...

1016
01:27:53,832 --> 01:27:56,998
He didn't mean it, honey...
He's just a bit upset...

1017
01:27:57,416 --> 01:27:58,582
There now...

1018
01:27:58,916 --> 01:28:01,582
There... There...

1019
01:28:18,291 --> 01:28:19,332
Toby's gone!

1020
01:28:20,166 --> 01:28:23,539
He took my purse
and my bucking bronco statue.

1021
01:28:34,457 --> 01:28:36,039
What do you want to do, Sta...?

1022
01:28:36,916 --> 01:28:37,957
Bree!

1023
01:28:41,000 --> 01:28:43,498
He's 17, but you don't know
his date of birth?

1024
01:28:43,916 --> 01:28:46,207
What's your relationship
to the missing boy?

1025
01:28:48,166 --> 01:28:49,498
I am his father.

1026
01:28:51,166 --> 01:28:54,664
- Can't you put out an APB
or something? - We'll do our best.

1027
01:28:55,375 --> 01:28:59,082
I'm sorry to say this, but chances are
if he doesn't wanna be found...

1028
01:28:59,332 --> 01:29:00,873
...he's gonna stay lost.

1029
01:30:09,250 --> 01:30:10,332
Hey!

1030
01:30:10,625 --> 01:30:11,664
This is Bree.

1031
01:30:22,707 --> 01:30:24,457
Thank you very much.

1032
01:30:37,666 --> 01:30:41,832
Everything's fine.
The surgery was a complete success.

1033
01:31:14,832 --> 01:31:16,207
Hello, my baby!

1034
01:31:19,332 --> 01:31:20,539
How are you feeling?

1035
01:31:22,500 --> 01:31:24,498
And don't say "like a new woman"!

1036
01:31:25,457 --> 01:31:30,664
I... feel like a...
medieval heretic...

1037
01:31:31,875 --> 01:31:39,332
...impaled on a very large
and very thick... stake...

1038
01:31:40,916 --> 01:31:42,082
...with splinters.

1039
01:31:45,582 --> 01:31:46,664
Nice hat!

1040
01:31:50,082 --> 01:31:51,414
It was a present.

1041
01:31:55,375 --> 01:31:59,832
Bree, why do I get the feeling that
there's something not quite right?

1042
01:31:59,957 --> 01:32:03,082
Last week you said this was gonna be
the happiest day of your life.

1043
01:32:03,832 --> 01:32:05,623
Last week was a long time ago.

1044
01:32:13,416 --> 01:32:14,582
Talk to me.

1045
01:32:19,957 --> 01:32:21,373
I fucked up.

1046
01:32:37,957 --> 01:32:38,998
It hurts.

1047
01:32:40,125 --> 01:32:41,498
Oh, my sweetie...

1048
01:32:43,541 --> 01:32:45,164
That's what hearts do.

1049
01:33:05,750 --> 01:33:06,957
I'm sorry.

1050
01:33:07,166 --> 01:33:08,457
No. Let it out.

1051
01:33:09,332 --> 01:33:12,623
This is good.

1052
01:34:21,166 --> 01:34:22,957
¡Ay! ¡Qué regalo para mí!

1053
01:34:26,291 --> 01:34:30,664
- Amo la comida mexicana.
- Amo la comida mexicana.

1054
01:34:30,957 --> 01:34:32,998
¡Y amo... a Fernando!

1055
01:34:33,916 --> 01:34:38,082
Amo la comida mexicana.
Mexicana.

1056
01:34:44,082 --> 01:34:46,248
School's going to be closing
in about 15 minutes.

1057
01:34:47,207 --> 01:34:50,039
Wayne, this is really hard.
Do you think you could give me a hand?

1058
01:34:50,166 --> 01:34:51,539
Sure. What subject?

1059
01:34:51,957 --> 01:34:53,123
Sex education.

1060
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:58,623
Alright, cut!

1061
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,832
Lucky, needs help again!
Let's go!

1062
01:35:04,082 --> 01:35:06,414
- Did you take your Viagra?
- Yes, ma'am.

1063
01:35:07,041 --> 01:35:09,998
- When's the last time you came?
- About 2 hours ago.

1064
01:35:11,041 --> 01:35:14,289
Christ, kid! You've got to focus!
Can you focus?

1065
01:35:14,416 --> 01:35:16,748
We are behind schedule.
We've got to move!

1066
01:35:38,957 --> 01:35:39,998
Toby!

1067
01:35:40,250 --> 01:35:43,582
Don't think that I'm fucking
forgiving you, because I'm not.

1068
01:35:46,416 --> 01:35:47,539
Alright.

1069
01:35:50,832 --> 01:35:52,998
I just came over to see
if you did it.

1070
01:35:53,541 --> 01:35:54,582
Did what?

1071
01:35:55,832 --> 01:35:57,707
Got your dick turned inside out.

1072
01:35:58,332 --> 01:35:59,373
Yes.

1073
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:01,248
Won't you come in?

1074
01:36:02,000 --> 01:36:03,457
Just for a little while?

1075
01:36:04,666 --> 01:36:06,082
I have something for you.

1076
01:36:07,000 --> 01:36:07,998
What?

1077
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:10,082
Please.

1078
01:36:23,082 --> 01:36:25,082
Your parents' house is a lot nicer.

1079
01:36:25,207 --> 01:36:27,414
My parents' house
comes with my parents.

1080
01:36:31,125 --> 01:36:32,957
I thought you said we were Jewish.

1081
01:36:33,041 --> 01:36:36,539
Half Jewish through my father,
so it's technically the wrong half.

1082
01:36:37,000 --> 01:36:39,457
And you're only a quarter.
The wrong quarter.

1083
01:36:41,291 --> 01:36:46,123
I'm gonna finish up my degree.
I thought I'd take up teaching...

1084
01:36:47,000 --> 01:36:48,998
...maybe rent a house some place...

1085
01:36:50,250 --> 01:36:51,664
...some place with a yard.

1086
01:36:52,541 --> 01:36:53,998
What have you got for me?

1087
01:36:55,875 --> 01:36:57,164
Hang on a minute.

1088
01:36:58,582 --> 01:36:59,914
I've missed you.

1089
01:37:02,082 --> 01:37:03,332
Have a seat.

1090
01:37:07,332 --> 01:37:08,664
So how have you been?

1091
01:37:09,332 --> 01:37:10,373
I'm doing alright.

1092
01:37:15,125 --> 01:37:17,623
Would you care to divulge
a few more details?

1093
01:37:18,125 --> 01:37:20,123
- I'm making a movie.
- You are?

1094
01:37:21,541 --> 01:37:22,957
I told you I could.

1095
01:37:23,457 --> 01:37:26,039
They're already
doing the advertisement for it.

1096
01:37:33,207 --> 01:37:35,207
"Cowabunghole".

1097
01:37:36,000 --> 01:37:38,664
That's Dylan Reeves.
He's a big star.

1098
01:37:41,875 --> 01:37:43,123
And there's you.

1099
01:37:43,832 --> 01:37:45,707
It's a very... nice picture.

1100
01:37:46,375 --> 01:37:47,707
I like your hair.

1101
01:37:48,957 --> 01:37:51,873
If you wanna, I could get you
a discount when it comes out.

1102
01:37:52,750 --> 01:37:54,748
Thank you. That's very considerate.

1103
01:37:58,957 --> 01:38:02,457
I got these clothes
at the Beverly Center, Beverly Hills.

1104
01:38:13,707 --> 01:38:15,039
Would you like a coke?

1105
01:38:17,957 --> 01:38:19,164
I'II take a beer.

1106
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:23,039
Alright.

1107
01:38:33,250 --> 01:38:34,289
Young man...

1108
01:38:34,416 --> 01:38:37,873
...if you think you can put your dirty
shoes on my brand new coffee table...

1109
01:38:38,000 --> 01:38:39,664
...you're gonna have to think again.
