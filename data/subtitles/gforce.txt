1
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,400
Hey, slow down!

2
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,400
That is not cool!

3
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,100
Thank you for coming tonight, Darwin.

4
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:57,500
This room is secure,
so we can speak freely.

5
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,600
Why the secrecy?

6
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,200
Because the Feds are coming
tomorrow... to shut us down.

7
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:09,500
Shut us down?
Without even giving us a chance?

8
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,500
Yes.

9
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,500
And there's only one way
we can save this department,

10
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,300
and that's prove ourselves,
in the field.

11
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,500
Our target is Leonard Saber.

12
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:35,600
As you know, he is a former arms dealer
and current CEO of Saberling Industries.

13
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:39,900
The Bureau's intel shows Saber
has developed a new microchip

14
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,800
with possible military applications.

15
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:47,900
They suspect he has sold his technology
to the Far East under the code name...

16
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,000
...Clusterstorm.

17
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:52,900
Now, Darwin, we need to find out
how Saber plans to use this technology.

18
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:55,200
Your mission is to download
the Clusterstorm files

19
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:59,100
from Saber's personal computer
located in his library, right here.

20
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,200
Ben, we're gonna get you that evidence.

21
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,600
We'll prove, once and for all,
what we can do.

22
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,200
We'll give 'em no choice.

23
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:15,100
They'll have to keep the program
and make us special agents.

24
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:18,700
Look, I believe in you,
but if we fail...

25
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,300
...we blow a case they've been
trying to crack for two years.

26
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,100
Hey, I'm nine inches tall.
I only see the upside.

27
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:44,700
Right this way, sir.

28
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:46,600
Thank you.

29
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,000
Tick tock, we're on the clock.
Speckles, do you copy?

30
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:09,300
Ten-four. I read you, Darwin.
Five-by-five.

31
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,700
All communication systems are online.

32
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,700
Status report.

33
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,200
I have a visual on Saber.

34
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,500
He's wearing a $6,000 suit,
$50,000 watch,

35
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,400
and, according to my infrared scope,
Hanes size 36 tighty whiteys.

36
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:32,500
Saber's about to start his speech.
Remember, the clock is ticking, dude.

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,600
Blaster, Juarez, what's your twenty?

38
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:38,200
Juarez here.
Approaching first objective.

39
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,800
We're ten seconds ahead of schedule
because Blaster is a little hyped-up.

40
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,900
Of course I am.
This is what I live for.

41
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,100
Time to get this party started.

42
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,800
- Talk to me, do we have any activity?
- Southbound is secure.

43
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,700
OK, we're clear.

44
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,300
Darwin, you're behind schedule.
You all right?

45
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,800
- First mission jitters, I guess.
- Do you want to abort?

46
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,500
No, no, it's OK.
I've been trained to do this.

47
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,100
I'd follow you
into a snarling pack of Dobermans!

48
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:10,300
Oh, wait. I already have.

49
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,300
Now, get your fuzzy hind end moving.

50
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:14,900
Hold on. There's a civilian
passing through the perimeter.

51
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,900
What are you looking at?
Move along, pal.

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,800
Don't worry. I just spotted my way in.

53
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:44,400
Juarez...

54
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,200
- Blaster, don't drop a pellet.
- Too late.

55
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,400
I'm cool.

56
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,700
Speckles to Mooch. Getting no visual.

57
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,600
Over.

58
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,900
The fly is in the ointment.
Darwin, do you copy?

59
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,100
Yeah, you're right.

60
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,100
Holy foxes.

61
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:21,800
- What's your twenty?
- I'm in the morgue.

62
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:37,700
Don't you wish your blowtorch
was hot like mine

63
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,900
Good thing I took shop.

64
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,400
Welcome to my home.

65
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:52,800
I want you to know how grateful I am
to all of you for, once again, making us

66
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,300
the number one consumer
electronics brand in the world!

67
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,600
Yeah, yeah.

68
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,800
These things are so popular,
I can't get one.

69
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,100
Mooch, focus. Come on, honey.

70
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:10,100
You're not here for the sweets.
Get back on mission.

71
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:13,300
For years,
we've been putting a secret...

72
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:17,600
...into the heart of every member
of the Saberling family,

73
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:23,000
be it the cryogenic refrigerator or
the new microwave-heated coffeemaker.

74
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,600
A secret which is at the core of
any successful family: communication.

75
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:39,800
- Hey, Juarez. Race you to the top!
- OK. On your mark, get set, go!

76
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,100
That's cold.

77
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,900
Darwin, the table's set. You are clear
to infiltrate Saber's study.

78
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,400
OK, I'm in.

79
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,100
Clearing exfil route.

80
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,900
- Hey, it worked!
- Of course it worked.

81
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:00,900
Nothing happens in this house
that I don't know about. Trust me.

82
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,800
In 48 hours, when I press this button,

83
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:10,300
it will activate a wireless system
we call "Sabersense,"

84
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:13,100
which will awaken the chips
already in the logic boards

85
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,100
of all Saberling appliances

86
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,800
allowing this coffee machine
to know how much coffee's been used,

87
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:23,800
communicate with your home computer,
and add coffee to your shopping list.

88
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:29,100
Now, in addition, Sabersense will link

89
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,100
every old and new Saberling
appliance in existence,

90
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,600
and create one big family!
And nothing will be the same.

91
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:44,200
Why did they put the Q
so far away from the O?

92
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,700
- OK, I'm in.
- Roger. I'm tracking it.

93
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:53,700
So what about it, Juarez?
You and me, I mean, you know...

94
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,100
Sorry, Blaster. You know
I've got my eye on someone else.

95
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,900
- No. In fact, I didn't know. Who?
- Darwin.

96
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:01,900
Why Darwin?

97
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:05,600
Because he's so...
so not interested in me.

98
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,900
Copy that, Juarez.

99
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:09,900
- Oh, shoot!
- Keep the comm line clear, please.

100
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:17,200
- OK, Speckles, I think I found it.
- Thank you, and good night.

101
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,000
Saber wrapped his speech.
Mooch, give me an eyeball.

102
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,100
Christa, I'm going upstairs for a drink.

103
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,700
Darwin, Saber's heading up.

104
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,200
ETA: about 50 seconds.

105
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:32,000
Copy that.
I'm into the Clusterstorm file.

106
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,600
- Speckles, are you seeing this?
- I see it.

107
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:43,500
This isn't about selling weapons.
It's about global extermination.

108
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,600
I'm downloading now.

109
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,300
Whatjust happened?

110
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,600
Encryption. Hands off the keys.

111
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,800
- I'm setting up a worm to decipher.
- Mooch.

112
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,600
You have to stop Saber.
Execute delay strategy B.

113
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:14,200
I'm back in. Commencing download.

114
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,900
- Speckles, you're a genius!
- I'm a mole. I got a thing for worms.

115
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,500
Switching to wireless download.

116
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:29,600
Come on. Come on!

117
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:44,700
Darwin. Get out of there, now!

118
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,700
I can't.
The chimney will block the signal.

119
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,700
Come on, baby, come on.

120
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,100
If he doesn't make it,
are you free Thursday night?

121
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,400
He'll make it.

122
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,900
- OK, drop the line.
- Here we go.

123
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,800
Now, Blaster!

124
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:23,400
Ouch!

125
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:28,000
Darwin! Your butt's on fire!

126
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:30,000
Stop, drop and roll!

127
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:37,400
- We got it. Speckles, exfil.
- Way ahead of you.

128
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:41,300
I'll be waiting at the entrance
of the... Oh, no!

129
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:43,500
Oh, my God!

130
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,300
Speckles reports
a large canine at exfil.

131
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:49,000
No escape. Repeat: no escape.

132
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,800
Hang on, Speckles.
We leave no rodent behind.

133
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,800
- I'm going after the dog!
- Wait, Blaster! Think it through!

134
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,800
There's no time for thinking.

135
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,100
Juarez, Blaster's gonna need backup.

136
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,000
- Got it.
- I'll rescue Speckles.

137
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,200
Hey, meathead!

138
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,000
Oh, did you see that?

139
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,600
Let's go, old buddy.

140
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:27,300
- Mayday! Mayday!
- Heads up, boys!

141
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:31,200
Yeah, Juarez! You get him, girl!

142
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,900
We're out of here. Let's go.

143
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,700
Something spooked the dog.
Let's check it out.

144
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,400
Blaster, Juarez, exfil.

145
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:43,800
By the way, in case you missed it,
I just saved your fuzzy behind.

146
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,600
We should celebrate over dinner.

147
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,300
Hang on, Speckles.
We're going off-road.

148
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,900
Gas!

149
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,800
OK. We're clear.

150
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,600
That was a little heavy
on the smoke, Ben.

151
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:18,400
Yo, Juarez, did you catch the little
leg twitch at the end of my "death?"

152
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,600
That was acting, baby. I was feeling it!

153
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,800
Yes, amazing.
Tell me you are not part possum.

154
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:28,500
OK, you can laugh now, but some of
those people back there were crying.

155
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,300
It was like the end of Old Yeller.

156
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:34,800
Mooch! You made it. Good.
How'd it go in there, guys?

157
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:38,500
The game's over for Saber. It's all
there. Clusterstorm, everything.

158
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:40,300
Our training finally paid off.

159
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,000
I knew you could do this.
This is great.

160
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,300
- G-Force!
- G-Force?

161
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:49,000
I figured we need a name. Like,
you know, Green Berets or Navy SEALs.

162
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,900
Come on. G-Force!

163
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,900
- No.
- The pose is cute.

164
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,700
- Is everything ready?
- Yeah, it's getting there.

165
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:02,200
Good. Feds won't be able to
shut us down with this evidence.

166
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,100
Does this make me look fatter?

167
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,500
- No. I think you look nice.
- How much longer, Speckles?

168
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,500
Just a few more touches to decode
Saber's crypto-system.

169
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,800
To access the information
on Darwin's PDA,

170
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,900
I have to factor a univariate
polynomial over a finite field.

171
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,400
OK. Hey, do I look fat in this?
I haven't worn a jacket since the prom.

172
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:27,600
You look very... sharp.

173
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:36,900
"Because he's so not interested. "

174
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:42,400
- What does that mean?
- Men are like government bonds.

175
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,900
They take way too long to mature.

176
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:48,100
But if you're a woman
trying to make it in a man's world,

177
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,600
you have to learn to think
like they do and keep them guessing.

178
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,400
Candygram.

179
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,500
Juarez?

180
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,500
I heard over the wire
that you're interested.

181
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,400
I'm not interested.

182
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:05,200
That's not what you told Blaster.

183
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,300
Don't you get it?
I want him interested in me.

184
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,000
And he'll only be interested
if he thinks I'm not.

185
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,100
But you are interested?

186
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,300
- Of course.
- But not in me.

187
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,900
No, no, no. Because you know
you could have me,

188
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,700
which makes you not interested,

189
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,000
and that means I wouldn't be
interested in you even if I were.

190
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,100
OK, everybody, they're here.

191
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:35,200
G-Force, in your positions.
It's showtime.

192
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,500
Hello.

193
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,500
Director Killian?

194
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,400
I'm Ben.

195
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,900
Congratulations on becoming the
new task force director. That's neat.

196
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,300
Let's save the chitchat.

197
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,400
Time is money.

198
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,500
OK.

199
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:52,900
Many people don't know
that since the Civil War

200
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,200
animals have been used
to gather strategic intelligence.

201
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:57,700
Now, our work focuses on
developing communication

202
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,500
between humans and animals. Now, these
cockroaches right here have been trained

203
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:04,100
to carry microcameras
into surveillance zones,

204
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:07,600
which is, I think, really kind of neat.

205
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:11,500
Congratulations. Dr. Kendall, do you
mean to tell me that Homeland Security

206
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:14,400
is financing a roach motel?

207
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,100
This is a rodent.

208
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:23,000
Guinea pig, sir. Don't say that.
They get highly offended.

209
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,900
You know their DNA is 98.7 percent
identical to humans, right?

210
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,500
No. How would I know that?

211
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:32,300
So you'll notice the extremely developed
sense of motor skills.

212
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,200
That's because their brains
have close to a billion neurons,

213
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,400
and a trillion synapses.

214
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,100
That's a thousand times stronger
than any supercomputer.

215
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,700
It gives them exceptional, like,
eye-hand reflexes.

216
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,800
It's a video game.

217
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:46,600
Yeah. And there's something over here...
OK, we'll go over here.

218
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,800
You're really gonna be amazed by this.

219
00:15:50,200 --> 00:15:51,500
It's a language decoder.

220
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,600
It enables animals to talk to humans.

221
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,300
Without it, they sound like
normal animals. Go ahead, take a look.

222
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:04,600
You're Doctor Dolittle.
You talk to animals.

223
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,000
Talking to animals is the easy part.

224
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Getting them to talk back,
that's the hard part.

225
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:13,200
- Darwin! Juarez! Blaster!
- So these guys are special agents?

226
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,400
Yeah, just like we're gonna be.

227
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,200
- Hey, how you doing?
- That's impossible.

228
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,500
No, no, no. Finding something that
fits me off the rack, that's impossible.

229
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,600
Think that's something? Check out
Speckles. He's been decrypting the file.

230
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,100
- Who's Speckles?
- Our mole.

231
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,000
Star-nosed breed. Blind as a bat.

232
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,300
IQ off the charts.
He's lucky I found him.

233
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:37,100
- His family was exterminated.
- We're ready.

234
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,600
Last night, G-Force was able to get

235
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,900
some intelligence regarding
Project Clusterstorm.

236
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,900
You ran a mission
without my authorization?

237
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,500
Yes. We went to Saber's mansion and...

238
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:47,900
Wait a second, you broke into
Leonard Saber's house?

239
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:51,100
We accomplished in one night what
you guys couldn't do in two years.

240
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,300
And without a warrant. Holla.

241
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:55,300
Blaster, cool it.

242
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:01,600
I knew we were up for review, and I
wanted to show you what we could do.

243
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,700
All right, then show me.
What'd you get?

244
00:17:03,700 --> 00:17:05,100
Speckles, you're on.

245
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,800
- Darwin's PDA contains classified...
- Just open it.

246
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,700
What is it?

247
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:18,700
- A cappuccino machine?
- What? That's not right.

248
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,600
I downloaded the Clusterstorm file,
not plans for a coffee machine.

249
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,300
- Right computer, wrong file.
- Darwin, what happened?

250
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,400
Specks, show them the Clusterstorm file.

251
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:32,000
Well, this is all we have. I'm sorry.

252
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,300
No, that's not it! It's about
global extermination. I saw it.

253
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:40,500
That's it, Kendall. Outside... now.

254
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,600
What a surprise.
The guinea pig mission didn't work out.

255
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,900
I'm shutting you down.

256
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,500
- You can't do this.
- Yeah, I can.

257
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,800
You performed an unauthorized infil,

258
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,300
compromised a two-year
undercover FBI operation,

259
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,600
and came out with the crucial intel
that Leonard Saber,

260
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,500
and stand by for this,
makes coffee machines.

261
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,400
This means we're in big trouble now.

262
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,100
¡Cállate ya!

263
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,000
You have to admit,
I've done some amazing things

264
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,800
as far as animal intelligence in there.

265
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:17,000
Thanks to you, those rodents can speak.
But sadly that means they're now capable

266
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:19,900
of exposing the derelict activities
committed on my watch.

267
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:20,800
- Yeah, but I...
- No!

268
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,600
I'm not gonna take the heat
for this, Kendall.

269
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,200
I'm not going down in Washington
as the crazy gopher guy.

270
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:29,600
Dr. Kendall's coming with me.
Cage anything that moves.

271
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:33,500
- Cage? Oh, no!
- What about my team here?

272
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,500
Here's an idea.

273
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,100
Since they're guinea pigs,
why don't we use them as guinea pigs?

274
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:40,000
- What?
- Oh, no.

275
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,600
Guys, we've got company.

276
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,700
We've got to get out of here.
The document capsules. Let's move.

277
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,500
- Vamos.
- Leave the gear behind.

278
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,700
All right, we're going native.
Lock and load.

279
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:52,100
I always wanted to say that.

280
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,300
Let's go.

281
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,400
Sorry, Speckles.
Talking animal, dead giveaway.

282
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,000
- No! No, not my glasses.
- In you go. Let's go.

283
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,800
No. No.

284
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,600
It's OK. I'll be right behind you.
Now, Marcie.

285
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,600
Good luck, team.

286
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,000
I love my job!

287
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,600
No! No!

288
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,800
Marcie, you tell Ben
the Clusterstorm file is on that PDA.

289
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,900
- And you tell him this isn't over.
- OK.

290
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,800
What we have here
is your classic case...

291
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,600
- Be quiet. I'll distract them.
- ... and overspending.

292
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:33,800
- Bye, guys. Have fun in the lab.
- Hey, hey!

293
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,600
- Would you put that down, please?
- Put it down.

294
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:40,800
It's not working. Come on. Come on.

295
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,700
- It's empty.
- Stealth hamsters.

296
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:47,300
A special coating on the fur.

297
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:49,800
Light bends around them.
Renders them invisible.

298
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,300
That is ridiculous.

299
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,000
We did see hamsters talk.

300
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:57,800
- Now, let me see now.
- Step aside.

301
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,500
What are you doing?
Why are you letting them out?

302
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,400
- What?
- Oh, my God! They're everywhere!

303
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,300
I don't see anything.

304
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:05,500
On the floor...
Be careful not to step on them.

305
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,100
- What was that?
- What was what?

306
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,600
There's no such thing
as a stealth hamster.

307
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,800
Be cool if there were, though.

308
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,300
Juarez, what's the situation?

309
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,100
FBI.

310
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,300
They got the whole lab surrounded.

311
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,400
I'll need to inspect your goods.

312
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,000
Let's go.

313
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:41,200
Yeah, 20 bags of Falfa Cravins.
Yes, I know.

314
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:46,700
- We can hide in here. Go, go, go!
- No, not the cage!

315
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,700
This facility's closed.
Get this delivery truck out of here.

316
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:52,800
- I don't do cages!
- Speckles, let go!

317
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,200
Great. Now we are locked in.

318
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,100
What do you think?
Is this the frying pan or the fire?

319
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:12,800
Let's all agree right now.
None of this goes on our résumé.

320
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:15,500
This is Killian.

321
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:19,800
We're locking the building down, sir,
but the animals have all bolted.

322
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:22,200
If those animals bolted,
then I got a problem.

323
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,000
I want them all back,
dead or alive, zero exposure.

324
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:28,700
- Three guinea pigs and a mole. Got it?
- Yes, sir.

325
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,300
I've never seen
such fat animals in my life.

326
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,600
Don't they have a gym around here?
A Jamba Juice or something?

327
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,100
Lay off the nuggets, man.

328
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:52,500
All right, my furry little friends.
Welcome to your new home.

329
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,800
Good luck getting out.

330
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,100
- G-Force!
- Why did you just do that?

331
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:03,000
I thought it might cheer us up.

332
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,400
You can'tjust blurt it out anytime.
It ruins the effect.

333
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,800
Guys, guys. Cool it.
The world's at stake.

334
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,200
We got to get out of here.

335
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:13,400
Then what? The Feds want to
turn us into guinea pigs.

336
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,200
They'll never take us seriously.

337
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:17,400
Well, we did get the wrong file.

338
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:20,500
No, I downloaded the right file,
and we're gonna prove it

339
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:22,100
as soon as we find a way out of here.

340
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:25,300
Well, let's ask that guy.
He looks cute and friendly.

341
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,800
Excuse me,
my incarcerated little friend.

342
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:29,700
- May I ask you a question?
- Don't move!

343
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,800
All I'm saying is, know your place,
behind this line. That's all I'm saying.

344
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,000
Is he talking to us?

345
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,600
Did someone order a knuckle sandwich?
Because I'm about to make a delivery.

346
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,600
Wow. You talk a lot of smack
for a little guy, buddy.

347
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,500
"Buddy?" No.
For your information, it's "Bucky. "

348
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:49,000
And if you want to stay alive,
do not cross that line!

349
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:52,600
Take cover!

350
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:56,200
The horror! The horror!

351
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,800
I love the smell of napalm
in the morning!

352
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:03,300
Don't pay any attention to him.
He's a quarter ferret.

353
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:06,600
I have no ferret in me, Hurley.
That has never been proven.

354
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:07,800
Then why are you marked down?

355
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:11,100
I'm on sale!
Everyone goes on sale eventually.

356
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,900
This should come as no surprise, but
he grew up in the psych ward at UCLA.

357
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,400
- Mice are on sale. Everybody's on sale.
- Enough with the line already.

358
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,800
We agreed this was my zone.
We all agreed that, right?

359
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:23,800
- Right.
- The mice will agree to anything.

360
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:25,900
- You guys are all idiots, right?
- Right!

361
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:27,900
Oh, yeah? Fine!

362
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:32,900
- Yeah, he's very sensitive.
- Not a ferret!

363
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:37,600
- Welcome, my friends, to the family.
- Where is the bathroom?

364
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,400
Well, for me, this morning,

365
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,100
the sports page, which is
pretty much where you're standing.

366
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:44,300
- Nasty!
- Look, don't worry.

367
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:47,100
They put down newspaper every day,
there's plenty to read.

368
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:49,000
We don't have time for this.

369
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:53,400
- Locate escape options.
- OK, here we go. Stand back!

370
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:57,300
- I'm gonna break the glass.
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.

371
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,900
This might be a good time for a nap.

372
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:05,900
OK. The truth is my grandmother met
a ferret at the San Diego petting zoo,

373
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:07,900
but nothing happened.
They simply dated.

374
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:10,200
My papers say hamster, end of story.

375
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,200
Now stop looking at the line!

376
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:14,200
Darwin, please let me
pull his tongue out.

377
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,500
Negative. Nobody touches the ferret.

378
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,500
I am not a ferret!

379
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:20,500
You try to pull my tongue out,
you'll see what happens...

380
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:21,900
Let's check that lock.

381
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,900
G-Force, Delta formation.

382
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,000
You guys from the circus or something?

383
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,600
- The circus!
- I hate the circus.

384
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:40,200
No, we're not from the circus.

385
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,900
We're specially bred,
genetically altered,

386
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,500
- and highly trained secret agents.
- Known as G-Force!

387
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,900
I get it. You guys are transfers
from the Hollywood store.

388
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,000
Darwin, it's locked.

389
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,800
We need another way out.

390
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,800
Mooch!
Go find Ben and report our location.

391
00:24:58,800 --> 00:25:01,900
Clusterstorm launch is in... 29 hours.

392
00:25:01,900 --> 00:25:03,300
Wait. Who's Mooch?

393
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:06,300
- The fly.
- Oh, man. Talking to the flies.

394
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,400
And I thought the ferret was crazy.

395
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,200
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

396
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,600
What happened in there?

397
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,100
Well, I told them
we shouldn't be shut down.

398
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,500
And then I got to the bit
where I talk to guinea pigs,

399
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,600
- and then that's where I lost 'em.
- Darwin told me, before he left,

400
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,700
that he was positive
he downloaded the right file.

401
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,100
Where is the PDA?

402
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:46,000
- It's still back at the warehouse.
- Well, we gotta go get it.

403
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,400
Security's probably
crawling all over the place.

404
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,900
- That's all right. I've got an idea.
- OK, what do we do about the G-Force?

405
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,000
They're highly professional. They're
probably halfway back to my house.

406
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,800
Now, Hurley.

407
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:03,600
Blaster, why don't you
leave the tactics to me?

408
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:08,700
- OK. No problem.
- So, Farty, how do you get adopted?

409
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,500
It's pretty simple. Act cute,
kid picks you out, takes you home,

410
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,600
and bingo, you're part of the family.

411
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:17,100
Except that, well, they never pick me.

412
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,400
Incoming.

413
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,800
Huddle up. OK, bring it in.

414
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,600
First, we get adopted. Then we escape.

415
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:31,200
Ben's house is the rendezvous point.
Now, go act cute.

416
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,400
Who's acting?

417
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,600
Check it out. I'm chasing my butt.
How cute is that?

418
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:43,100
- Come on, Specks. You, too. Act cute.
- I don't have that kind of range.

419
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:46,800
Grandpa, what is that?

420
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,300
That's a hideous crime
against nature, I'd say.

421
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,600
I'm outta here.

422
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:55,400
- What can I help you with, young lady?
- I want a hamster.

423
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:01,100
Yes! Yes! I am out, baby!
Finally, the recognition I deserve.

424
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:05,000
- Her. With the big cheeks.
- What?

425
00:27:04,900 --> 00:27:07,800
- I could put bows in her hair.
- What?

426
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:10,500
I'm the hamster. They're guinea pigs!

427
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,400
- Watch the hands, buddy.
- One oversized hamster. There you go.

428
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:19,000
You try to put a bow on me,
you're gonna lose a finger.

429
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,700
That little girl
has no idea what she's in for!

430
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:26,700
I'm gonna put nail polish
and lipstick on her and a dress.

431
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,400
A dress?
You're going to lose your whole hand.

432
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,800
Juarez, remember.

433
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:34,300
I know. Maintain my cover
until I have a chance to escape.

434
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:37,600
What about that little fur ball there?
He looks like he's full of life.

435
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:41,600
- No, no. Give me the fat one.
- I'm not fat. I'm fluffy.

436
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,500
Even if you forget to feed this guy
every now and then,

437
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:45,500
it wouldn't bother him.

438
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,200
- He's a little plump as it is.
- That's probably a good thing.

439
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:53,200
Oh, mama! This is it. This is it!

440
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,600
- What do these fellas eat?
- I'll show you. Follow me.

441
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,200
- Come on, Penny.
- See you on the outside!

442
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,800
Hey, guys, I can see my future!
It's all cakes and cuddles!

443
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:08,000
I think he's gonna
throw him in with the snake.

444
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:25,900
Make way. Hamster coming through.

445
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,600
You're lucky I'm not in there,
snake boy,

446
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,700
because it would've been
lights out for you!

447
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,700
I would've hit you so hard
you would have shed yourself.

448
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:45,300
Then I would have turned you
into a nice pair of snakeskin boots.

449
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:48,200
That kid's a monster.
He just lifted him up and...

450
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:52,300
- Come on, kid.
- Blaster, do something.

451
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:55,700
- What do you suggest I do?
- Poop in his hand. Poop in his hand.

452
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:57,700
Hey, Grandpa, changed my mind.

453
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,500
Oh, no, no, not upside down,
not upside down. Hold him like this.

454
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,000
Where did...
Where did the chubby one go?

455
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,000
I don't know.

456
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,300
All right, Specks. We have to think
of a way out of here.

457
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,800
There you are.

458
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,400
I knew you were trouble.
I can see it in your eyes.

459
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,000
At 0920 local time,

460
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,400
Saber initiated a call to the usual
recipient, Mr. Yanshu, in Beijing.

461
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,600
He left a message saying the launch
was on track for Project Clusterstorm.

462
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:27,700
Since then, nothing.

463
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,700
Kip, our FISA tap just isn't cutting it.

464
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:32,700
Sir, with respect, if you were
to authorize a search warrant...

465
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,700
On what grounds?

466
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:37,100
I can't authorize a search warrant
without probable cause, and he knows it.

467
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,800
Saber comes from
the defence supply industry.

468
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:40,800
- He knows how to cover his tracks.
- Sir...

469
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:45,000
Just give me cause,
and I can authorize. Keep listening.

470
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:48,700
- We are listening, sir.
- Son, listen harder.

471
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,500
Careful.

472
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,400
- Come here.
- No, porfavor.

473
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,900
No, not pink. And it stinks!

474
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:04,600
This has to be against
the Geneva Convention.

475
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,900
Where is Blaster?
We have to get out of here.

476
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,400
I think you need lipstick, too.

477
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,500
The tiara.

478
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:18,100
Enough already.
This is the tenth outfit.

479
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:20,000
Don't you look pretty?

480
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:25,200
Oh, my gosh.
I look like Paris Hilton's chihuahua.

481
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,800
Let me do this, Specks.
I'll come back and get you.

482
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,400
Relax. They told me
one of the mice died last week,

483
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,000
and was buried in the backyard.

484
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:38,400
Once I'm in the ground,
I can tunnel to freedom and rescue you.

485
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:44,500
Terrell! Oh, man.

486
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:51,500
- Terrell!
- Mamacita, relax.

487
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,800
Está muerto.

488
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,300
It's dead.

489
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,000
- Yeah, you're right. It is.
- Do something.

490
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:02,200
Wow. This woman's really abrasive.

491
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:06,400
You get it out of here before
it starts to smell up my shop. Hurry up.

492
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:10,200
- Just run, take it out back right now.
- I am. It's squishy.

493
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:16,200
Trash truck.
Let's just get it on out of here pronto.

494
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:19,400
That's not the plan.
No, no, no. Speckles, no!

495
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:22,600
Hold it.
Good luck, rest in peace and all that.

496
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:25,300
Oh, no!

497
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,400
Oh, my God!

498
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:32,200
No, no, no.

499
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:39,400
- Is this OK?
- Yeah, this is good.

500
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:41,700
OK, Harry.

501
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,500
You know what to do.

502
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:02,200
- She was way cuter than the other one.
- Definitely.

503
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,400
OK, he's got it. He's got the PDA.

504
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,200
What the hell was that?!

505
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,200
OK, I got him. I got him.

506
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:43,000
- Let's go. Just stay calm, OK?
- I got him. Here he is.

507
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:47,300
Look on the bright side: at least
you haven't been marked down yet.

508
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,600
What's that on your butt?

509
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:52,100
It's a birthmark.
Never seen a birthmark?

510
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:55,900
I have seen that birthmark.
Look at this. I got the same one.

511
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:57,900
Don't point that thing at me.
It might go off.

512
00:32:57,900 --> 00:33:03,100
Seriously, just look at my butt.
You see? You see? We must be related.

513
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:06,900
No. I am a genetically
engineered super spy.

514
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:10,600
Ben spent years training us. We do
things that people only dream of doing.

515
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,000
Yeah. That's what they want you
to think. So you'll do tricks for them.

516
00:33:13,900 --> 00:33:16,300
But you, my friend,
are a common, everyday

517
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:20,300
pet shop guinea pig just like me.
We must have been separated at birth.

518
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:24,000
But fate has brought us back together,
my brother.

519
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,600
- Don't say that.
- I have a brother.

520
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,500
- Don't say that word.
- I have a brother! Come here, brother.

521
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,800
Come here, brother.

522
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:34,000
All right. My brother doesn't like hugs.
I'm good with that.

523
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,000
I am not your brother.

524
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:38,900
Listen. Darwin,
I'm not gonna dress it up, OK?

525
00:33:38,900 --> 00:33:42,900
I sit here every day
hoping to get adopted, to find family.

526
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:47,600
And now, because of you,
family has found me.

527
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,800
Hurley, there is no way
that we are related,

528
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:53,200
so just get that
through your head, OK?

529
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,300
OK. Here we go.

530
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:06,800
Darwin was right.
The file was marked "Clusterstorm. "

531
00:34:07,500 --> 00:34:09,200
- Can you open this?
- I don't know.

532
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,200
OK, well, we've already seen that.

533
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:17,600
OK, just unplug the computer.
Unplug. Go, go, go.

534
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,200
- Was that a worm?
- Nope.

535
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:25,400
This PDA is infected
with an extermination virus.

536
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:28,400
Yes!

537
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,400
What is going on in there?

538
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:36,500
No, no, no! Not the line, not the line.
Don't cross the line.

539
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:42,700
Busted.

540
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,700
Can I offer you something?
A macadamia nut perhaps?

541
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:53,100
So, this is why I never saw you eat.
Not once in all these years.

542
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,100
All these treats and you never shared?

543
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:58,500
You think I wanted to spend my nights
sneaking out to feed myself?

544
00:34:58,500 --> 00:35:00,500
Starving by day and
praying for night to come

545
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:03,500
so I could take a bite without the
threat of you eating everything I have?

546
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,100
You drove me to this!

547
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:14,600
My friend Speckles
got crushed in a garbage truck,

548
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,700
and you said nothing about this.

549
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:23,600
I'm outta here.

550
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:26,200
- Darwin? I want you to go.
- I am going.

551
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:30,300
You can't worry about me. You got a job
to do. You can'tjeopardize it for me.

552
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,200
- I wasn't going to.
- You're only saying that

553
00:35:32,300 --> 00:35:34,800
so I won't have to feel the pain so bad
when you leave.

554
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:36,400
Keep believing that.
Whatever works for you.

555
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:38,200
Oh, what a guy. What a guy!

556
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:40,900
- OK, OK. Listen, Hurley.
- You got to go, man.

557
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,000
- I got to go. You got to let go.
- You got to go.

558
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,700
- I've got to let go.
- Let go of me.

559
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,100
- OK.
- OK.

560
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:47,800
Don't give up the dream.

561
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,000
You're gonna find the family
you're looking for someday.

562
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,200
So long.

563
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,200
So long, brother!

564
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:01,000
I miss him already.

565
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:10,300
Good luck with the climb back up,
Hurley! The cage is mine!

566
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,200
And it's all true.
My grandfather was a ferret!

567
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,800
Now who's been marked down?

568
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:24,400
So, there's the North Star,
which means Ben's is east.

569
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:27,100
OK, I need to head that way.

570
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,000
Go back, Hurley.

571
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,900
Fine!
You think I can't make it out here?

572
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:37,800
You think you're the only one
who can survive in the big bad world?

573
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:42,200
Well, the truth is, Hurley is out of
his cage, and it's time to hit the town!

574
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,300
Guinea pigs gone wild!

575
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,000
Yeah!

576
00:36:48,600 --> 00:36:50,400
Darwin!

577
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:54,100
Darwin? I saw a cat.

578
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:57,500
OK, you can come with me
until we find another pet shop.

579
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,400
Thanks, bro. Did I mention
I'm also afraid of the dark?

580
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:19,200
Greetings, Mr. Saber.
I have a status report.

581
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:22,500
You are a brilliant business partner,
Mr. Yanshu.

582
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:26,600
But remind me why we call these things
video conferences.

583
00:37:26,500 --> 00:37:32,000
As we've discussed, it's in everyone's
best interest my identity remain hidden.

584
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:35,800
Project Clusterstorm
is perfectly on course, sir.

585
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:39,100
Sabersense will activate
in about 19 hours.

586
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:43,300
Why are we spending a large amount
of money tracking space junk?

587
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,500
Old satellites. Booster rockets.

588
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:49,000
Four million pounds of debris.
And why do we care?

589
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:52,200
The satellites, sir.
Communication systems.

590
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,700
We have to protect them. Integral aspect
of the Sabersense network.

591
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:59,300
We've got a lot riding on this, Yanshu.

592
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:03,500
I've put my trust
in your engineering skills.

593
00:38:21,900 --> 00:38:24,000
- Mooch, is that you?
- Yeah, yeah!

594
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,700
Are the others OK?

595
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:28,900
- You know where they are?
- Yeah!

596
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:33,600
You want help with that?

597
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:40,300
E... I... i...

598
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:41,400
...a...

599
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,500
Oh, yeah.

600
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,500
Oh, Mooch... You're a genius.

601
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,000
I was so worried about you.
I don't like when my fly is down.

602
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,900
Hey, Marcie?
Yeah, it's Ben. I found them.

603
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:01,300
I'll be by in ten minutes
to pick you up.

604
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:06,600
There's the delivery truck from the lab.

605
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:08,900
¿Cómo estás, gentlemen?

606
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,300
We're looking for some rodents.

607
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,600
Si, for you or for your children?

608
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,400
For the government.

609
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:21,200
- We're special agents.
- What? Yeah, right.

610
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,600
Are they fugitives
or terrorists or something?

611
00:39:23,600 --> 00:39:25,200
Just answer the question.

612
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:34,700
OK, sorry. I'm just saying, you look
like a regular guinea pig to me.

613
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,600
Listen, I told you, I'm a commando
who just happens to be a guinea pig.

614
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:40,900
Oh, yeah?
So where's all your fancy spy gear?

615
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,200
Back at the lab.

616
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:46,400
Same lab where I keep
my hot Canadian guinea pig girlfriend?

617
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,100
That's where my stuff is, too.

618
00:39:48,200 --> 00:39:50,800
I have a unicorn back there
and a dragon that I ride around.

619
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:54,300
Look, if you want to stick with me,
stop with the yapping and keep up.

620
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:56,800
No can do, bro.
I'm calling a hunger strike.

621
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,200
And I am not moving an inch.

622
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,300
Civilians. Come on, soggy.

623
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:24,800
I'm hungry, I'm wet, I'm hungry...

624
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,300
Dogs!

625
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,100
Dogs. Why does it always
have to be dogs?

626
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,300
All right, MacGyver,
you got any brilliant ideas?

627
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:43,900
Yeah, I got an idea.

628
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:55,500
- I think we made it.
- Great. How do we stop it?

629
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:56,500
Just keep running.

630
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:59,100
That's not how you stop it!
That's how you make it go!

631
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:10,300
- Hurley, get your butt outta my face.
- Get your face outta my butt!

632
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:20,700
So this is what spies do.

633
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,000
¿Cómo estás, chica?

634
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:29,200
We're looking for
three guinea pigs and a mole.

635
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:32,900
Same one as the Feds,
or are yours from a rival militia?

636
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,100
Wait, what Feds?

637
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,700
Men in Black were here
looking for the same thing.

638
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:38,400
Wanted to know who had bought them.

639
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,600
And did you tell them?

640
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,600
No, I refused and we shot it out.
What do you think? It's the Feds!

641
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,500
Thank you.

642
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:52,200
Mine! The cage is mine!

643
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,400
This is gonna be awesome.

644
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:08,900
I'm pretty sure this is
animal cruelty, but I love it!

645
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:13,800
Yeah!

646
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,300
This wheel doesn't work!

647
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,400
Strike!

648
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,600
- Is that all you got?
- Ready to go for the record?

649
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,300
Maybe this would be a good time
for you to take your medication!

650
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:37,700
I feel the need... the need for speed!

651
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:44,800
Say cheese!

652
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,000
Excuse me! Coming through!

653
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:58,300
- Yeah!
- Yes!

654
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:02,600
- That was off the hizz-ook!
- Connor! Take out the trash.

655
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,200
OK.

656
00:43:04,900 --> 00:43:06,500
- Now!
- I'm coming!

657
00:43:08,300 --> 00:43:10,400
What do we have here?

658
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:14,100
You, my friend, suck.

659
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,500
I'm coming for you, Juarez.

660
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,100
That's what I'm talking about!

661
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,600
Time for a joyride.

662
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,500
Yeah!

663
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,600
Get out the road, fool!

664
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:37,700
- Hey!
- Don't become roadkill!

665
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,200
I ain't used to driving stick!

666
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,700
- Not this time!
- Stop it. Stop it! Come back!

667
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:48,400
I'll come back when you're older
and put you in prison!

668
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,300
- Get over here!
- Don't go anywhere.

669
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,300
- I'll be right back.
- Finally!

670
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:58,600
- Juarez, Juarez! Where are you?
- Connor, get him!

671
00:43:58,500 --> 00:44:00,400
I have to save his fur again?

672
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,700
Juarez?

673
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,300
Juarez!

674
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:14,200
Yeah!

675
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:22,000
I got you!

676
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,300
Why are you dressed like
"Guinea Pig Barbie?"

677
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:26,900
One more word and I'll turn you
into a small side of bacon.

678
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,400
Well, you are sizzling hot!

679
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:30,600
Connor!

680
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:32,700
Get this off of me!

681
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:41,700
Don't need that, or that, or that!

682
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:47,100
- Although, maybe this can stay.
- Juarez, you are fine china!

683
00:44:53,300 --> 00:44:55,000
What exactly are we doing, anyway?

684
00:44:55,000 --> 00:45:00,100
Two days ago, my team embarked on a
mission. Today, I'm gonna finish it.

685
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:03,900
My brother's a loon!
I love him, but he's...

686
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:08,300
Cake! Did I tell you I love cake?
I've heard of places like this!

687
00:45:08,100 --> 00:45:10,500
They sell something called "layer cake!"

688
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:13,300
It's notjust one cake,
it's many, in layers!

689
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:17,900
Often up to six!
It is the Holy Grail of human food!

690
00:45:17,800 --> 00:45:21,700
I can't believe you're getting
so excited about cake. Coffeemaker!

691
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:30,200
That's the same coffeemaker
that was on the Clusterstorm file.

692
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:33,300
Hurley, I got to check out
that coffeemaker. Stay close.

693
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:38,400
Fifty billion rodents in the world,
and I get stuck with this guy.

694
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,800
I hope you're keeping track
of all these parts.

695
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,300
Don't watch me. Watch my back.

696
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,300
Right now, you're my eyes and ears.
Just act natural.

697
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:56,800
- OK. Sure.
- Look, Daddy!

698
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,900
Hi, there. Hi.

699
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:06,700
- That wasn't very convincing.
- Hurley, do you know what this is?

700
00:46:06,700 --> 00:46:08,700
Yeah, I'm pretty sure
it's called vandalism.

701
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:11,200
This is a military grade,
multiple array transceiver

702
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:13,800
developed for the military's
Unmanned Weapons Program.

703
00:46:13,700 --> 00:46:16,000
Sorry, I tuned out there.
What were you saying?

704
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:18,000
I gotta get this chip back to Ben's.

705
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:23,300
OK, that's weird.

706
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:28,900
Hurley, duck!

707
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,700
Stay down!

708
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,100
I've heard coffee's bad for you,
but this is ridiculous!

709
00:46:42,100 --> 00:46:43,400
Come on, move it!

710
00:46:47,300 --> 00:46:49,600
- Why are we stopping?
- We're gonna fight it.

711
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:51,100
We're gonna do what?

712
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,900
We have to get that chip.

713
00:46:57,300 --> 00:46:58,700
Good luck with that!

714
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,300
- Suck in your gut!
- I am!

715
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:14,800
Darwin!

716
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,200
Hang on, Hurley!

717
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:19,500
Yippee-ki-yay, coffeemaker!

718
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,700
Watch out, bro!

719
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,200
You want some of this,
you overgrown can opener?

720
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:43,800
Don't think the warranty
is gonna cover that.

721
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:47,000
Oh, brother. I thought I lost you there.

722
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,000
OK, thanks Hurley! Boundaries!

723
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:52,500
Talk about a killer cappuccino.
What is this thing?

724
00:47:52,500 --> 00:47:54,700
This is Clusterstorm.

725
00:47:55,400 --> 00:47:58,700
Saber must be weaponizing
his entire line of appliances.

726
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,200
We have to get this back to Ben's.

727
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:02,300
How are we gonna do that?

728
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:13,600
Hey, bro? You have to admit,
we make a pretty sweet team.

729
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:16,500
I could get used to all this
secret agent stuff

730
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,500
if you're ever looking
for a new recruit.

731
00:48:19,100 --> 00:48:21,800
Hurley, just be quiet and lean right.

732
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,500
Look who I found out back.

733
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:28,300
- Blaster! Juarez!
- Darwin! You made it.

734
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:31,300
- Hurley, what are you doing here?
- Hey, guys!

735
00:48:31,100 --> 00:48:35,100
Hurley, up high. Down low. Too slow.

736
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:37,200
Wait a minute. Where's Speckles?

737
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Speckles didn't make it.

738
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:44,900
- What do you mean, he didn't make it?
- He was gonna break out

739
00:48:44,900 --> 00:48:47,800
and engineer our escape,
but then the mission went bad.

740
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,800
He got crushed in a garbage truck.

741
00:48:52,900 --> 00:48:56,600
- Speckles. Jeez.
- He sacrificed himself for us.

742
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,700
This is all my fault.

743
00:48:59,200 --> 00:49:01,400
Ben, there's nothing you could've done.

744
00:49:03,500 --> 00:49:06,800
No, I could've told you the truth
ofwho you really are.

745
00:49:08,700 --> 00:49:10,700
Darwin, I misled you.

746
00:49:11,900 --> 00:49:14,900
The truth is,
you're not genetically engineered.

747
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:16,700
Any of you.

748
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:20,400
I should've never... should've never
sent you out into the field. It's...

749
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:25,500
So we are not special at all?

750
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:28,700
No engineering? No enhancements?

751
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:32,800
We're just common, ordinary rodents?

752
00:49:32,600 --> 00:49:35,600
I wanted you guys to think of yourselves
as more than just balls of fur

753
00:49:35,600 --> 00:49:37,100
waiting for your next pellet.

754
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:40,400
Well, maybe you can
explain that to Speckles.

755
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:45,700
Ben, we need to know.
Tell us who we are.

756
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:47,700
OK, you guys want to know?

757
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:52,800
Juarez, we rescued you at a
roadside tapas stand in the Pyrenees.

758
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:55,700
I guess there you're some kind of,
you know, delicacy.

759
00:49:57,600 --> 00:49:59,200
Blaster, we found you
at a cosmetics company.

760
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:03,400
They were testing, you know, some kind
of hair gel for allergic reactions.

761
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:05,800
And Speckles we found...

762
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:09,800
...you know, right before his
home was dug out to build a golf course.

763
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,300
And, Darwin, I...

764
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,500
I purchased you at a pet store.

765
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:21,300
Your parents abandoned you
because you were the runt of the litter.

766
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:24,900
I was a runt? What do you mean?

767
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:29,800
I never even had a chance.

768
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,300
This is Carter.

769
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,300
OK, we're on it.

770
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,700
Dispatch just got a report of two giant
hamsters riding a skateboard on Pacific.

771
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,500
Let's finish this.

772
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:54,100
You were right all along. I am just an
average, everyday pet store guinea pig.

773
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:57,600
Since when did you
start listening to me?

774
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:00,200
My parents didn't even want me.

775
00:51:01,300 --> 00:51:05,100
Look, Darwin, you saved us from
the dogs, you defeated the Terminator,

776
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,400
read the stars like a map
and got us here.

777
00:51:07,400 --> 00:51:09,300
I couldn't have done any of that.

778
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:13,100
Do you have any idea how many guinea
pigs could've done all those things?

779
00:51:13,100 --> 00:51:17,000
I mean, literally, like three.
And they're all in this room.

780
00:51:21,900 --> 00:51:23,400
Yeah, you're right.

781
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:27,300
I may not be genetically engineered,
but I'm no house pet, either.

782
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:31,800
Hey team, come over here. Listen up.
What Ben did was right.

783
00:51:31,800 --> 00:51:35,800
He wanted us to believe in ourselves.
And we did believe.

784
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:39,400
We still have our training,
our abilities.

785
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:42,000
Blaster, you're a graduate
of West Point.

786
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:45,000
Yeah, correspondence course.

787
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,700
Yeah, whatever. And Juarez, how many
hours have you put in on that simulator?

788
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:51,500
Two hundred... thousand.

789
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,900
I helped with the tire!

790
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:59,700
We may be guinea pigs,
but we're not ordinary. We're special.

791
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:03,700
I still believe in us,
even if nobody else does.

792
00:52:05,100 --> 00:52:09,300
I believe.

793
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,600
I've always believed.

794
00:52:16,700 --> 00:52:20,100
Ben, we don't have much time.
That coffeemaker's no coffeemaker.

795
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:27,400
When I tried to disconnect this chip,
it came alive and it attacked us.

796
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,300
It was so gnarly!

797
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:33,400
If I hadn't been there to take
cover fire for Darwin, who knows...

798
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,300
The Sabersense microchip
caused it to transform.

799
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:40,700
Ben, Sabersense and Clusterstorm
are the same thing.

800
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:43,500
And if every Saber product
in the world has that chip,

801
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,000
that means that every appliance on Earth
is gonna be a killing machine.

802
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:48,400
Guys...

803
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:53,700
Sabersense launches in... 30 minutes.

804
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:56,200
I tried to access the
Clusterstorm file on your PDA,

805
00:52:56,200 --> 00:52:58,500
but Saber, he protected it
with some nasty virus.

806
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,600
I mean, I'm a little bit at a loss.

807
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:05,200
Sorry to interrupt. Quick question.

808
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,100
If that little thingamabob
is all that, like you say it is,

809
00:53:08,100 --> 00:53:10,600
why don't you just use that
to destroy Saber's mainframe?

810
00:53:13,200 --> 00:53:16,200
I'll go back in the box. Oh, pepperoni!

811
00:53:16,200 --> 00:53:19,700
- That could work. That could work!
- OK, let's do this!

812
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,500
Wait a second.
We don't have our equipment.

813
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:25,000
Well, that's not entirely true.

814
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:33,400
This is a little prototype
I've been working on

815
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:36,100
called the Rapid Deployment Vehicle.

816
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:38,600
She'll do 65
with the throttle wide open.

817
00:53:39,700 --> 00:53:44,000
And, Blaster, it has a rocking stereo.

818
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:48,700
That's what's up! Pimp my ride!

819
00:53:48,600 --> 00:53:51,600
All right, we got gear.
And we know our mission.

820
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:55,100
Infiltrate Saber's mansion,
locate the main network core

821
00:53:55,100 --> 00:53:57,100
and dock this infected PDA.

822
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,400
Bring down big mama with baby disease.

823
00:54:00,300 --> 00:54:03,100
I don't know what that means.
But, yeah, that's good.

824
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:05,700
Here are the keys.

825
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:12,300
- Don't scratch it.
- All right. This is for Speckles.

826
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:18,500
Dr. Kendall, we know you're in there!
Open the door!

827
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:21,500
Everybody, into the RDV!
You, too, Hurley. Move it!

828
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,400
Shotgun!

829
00:54:24,700 --> 00:54:27,400
Open the door, or we'll open it for you!

830
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:35,800
Hold on.

831
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,100
Don't these fools
know we're on the same team?

832
00:54:38,100 --> 00:54:40,900
- Juarez, plot us a course to Saber's.
- I'm on it.

833
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:47,300
- Go, go, go!
- I'm going, I'm going, I'm going!

834
00:54:47,300 --> 00:54:49,400
Mooch, we need eyes in the sky.

835
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:55,300
Call for backup.

836
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:58,600
Tell them we're in pursuit of three
guinea pigs driving mobile spheres.

837
00:54:58,500 --> 00:54:59,500
OK!

838
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,200
Actually, could you make that call?

839
00:55:04,700 --> 00:55:07,300
My stomach doesn't do well
with action-adventure.

840
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,000
Hurley, don't you dare.

841
00:55:10,700 --> 00:55:12,400
Yuck, Hurley. That's disgusting.

842
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:14,400
- I can't breathe.
- Roll down the window.

843
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:18,500
- These things don't have windows!
- That's real professional, guys.

844
00:55:21,700 --> 00:55:23,400
Mooch, where's that recon?

845
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:30,600
- OK, here come the bad guys.
- Better have their "A" game.

846
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:36,600
- Yeah!
- Mommy!

847
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,500
Where's that backup?

848
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:45,400
- May I ask why we're chasing rodents?
- No, you may not.

849
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:50,500
OK, you can just
let me out at the next corner.

850
00:55:53,700 --> 00:55:56,000
We got three party crashers on our tail.

851
00:55:57,500 --> 00:56:00,200
- Hurry up! You're losing them!
- They're boxing us in!

852
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:03,300
- Yeah, I got 'em, I got 'em.
- Maybe they want to adopt us!

853
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:06,100
Not likely, Hurley. Hold on, guys!

854
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:08,800
- Let's just crush 'em!
- Unlock it and rock it. Now!

855
00:56:10,700 --> 00:56:13,500
- Time to divide and conquer.
- See ya!

856
00:56:17,900 --> 00:56:22,600
- Oh, yeah! Come and get me!
- Where'd he go?

857
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,400
- How low can you go?
- There he goes! Under the trailer!

858
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,600
Little is the new big!

859
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:33,100
Bye-bye, bipeds! Smell you later!

860
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:36,100
- I want to go back to the pet store!
- You might want to buckle up.

861
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,600
He paid for undercoating.
What a sucker!

862
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:47,100
Let's see if it protects him from this.

863
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:51,300
- Hey, what's that?
- This is my little friend.

864
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:55,400
- Say hello.
- Hello!

865
00:56:55,900 --> 00:56:57,300
And goodbye!

866
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,600
Better hang on to your lunch!

867
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,200
Did we win?

868
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:21,600
This is Unit Two. We lost them.

869
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:25,500
How? You're driving a V-8. They're
rolling around in little plastic balls.

870
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:27,400
This one's not getting away from me!

871
00:57:29,500 --> 00:57:31,500
Darwin, I need some help here.

872
00:57:31,900 --> 00:57:33,800
Mooch, I need a visual on Juarez.

873
00:57:36,500 --> 00:57:40,300
- I can't get these guys off my tail.
- We don't have tails.

874
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:45,100
Hang on, Juarez. Hurley, we're
going to the fair. Blaster, hard right.

875
00:57:44,900 --> 00:57:47,600
All right, Juarez.
Let's take it to the house!

876
00:57:53,000 --> 00:57:54,500
OK, I'm taking the lead.

877
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:01,300
- You're scaring me!
- Shut it, Carter!

878
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,700
Here's that box of M-80s.
Careful with these.

879
00:58:04,700 --> 00:58:07,500
- You're driving angry!
- Yes, I am!

880
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:12,300
Come here, you little rodent.

881
00:58:13,100 --> 00:58:14,900
Carl, look out! Look out!

882
00:58:14,900 --> 00:58:17,500
Let's let 'em go,
let's let 'em go! Look out!

883
00:58:23,900 --> 00:58:28,400
- This is so festive!
- This is crazy. This is crazy!

884
00:58:28,400 --> 00:58:30,000
These are good seats!

885
00:58:30,000 --> 00:58:32,000
I'm gonna flatten this little varmint!

886
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,800
Mess with the bull, you get the horns.

887
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,700
Look out! Look out!

888
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:54,900
How you doing?

889
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:59,000
Don't try this at home, kids!

890
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:04,800
That was great! Let's do it again.

891
00:59:07,500 --> 00:59:12,600
Face it, Trigstad.
You just got out-driven by gophers.

892
00:59:21,400 --> 00:59:24,700
- Guys, I'm going in.
- Hurley, suck in your gut.

893
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:27,100
Blaster, I need to
tell you something about Juarez.

894
00:59:27,100 --> 00:59:29,700
You have nothing to worry about.
She's not interested in me.

895
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,300
- She told you that?
- Yeah. She really wants you...

896
00:59:32,300 --> 00:59:35,600
She's trying to make you more interested
in her by acting disinterested.

897
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:37,800
Yeah, well maybe
she told you she wants me

898
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:42,000
in order to look not interested in you,
which makes you more interested in her.

899
00:59:41,900 --> 00:59:43,200
Interesting.

900
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:51,100
Members of the Saberling inner sanctum,
my co-conspirators in this endeavour,

901
00:59:51,000 --> 00:59:53,800
are we ready to dominate?

902
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:58,100
Are we ready to change the world?

903
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:03,200
- Go, go, go, go!
- Geronimo!

904
01:00:06,300 --> 01:00:09,700
Hurley, this is our exfil. It's very
important that you stand guard.

905
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,700
Whatever you do, don't leave this spot.
We're counting on you.

906
01:00:12,700 --> 01:00:14,500
OK, OK. Got it.

907
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,600
Hey, does this mean
I'm part of the team?

908
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:20,800
There's the network core.
Behind the glass.

909
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:24,300
Look! We can gain access
through that panel.

910
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:26,200
OK, follow me.

911
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:29,700
- Hold up, guys.
- What is it?

912
01:00:29,700 --> 01:00:31,100
It's a tripwire.

913
01:00:31,700 --> 01:00:34,900
It's a booby trap.
Don't touch it, or this place'll blow.

914
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:37,800
Tick, tick, boom.

915
01:00:50,300 --> 01:00:53,000
I don't think anybody'll mind
if I check the perimeter.

916
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:56,900
As I press this button,

917
01:00:56,800 --> 01:01:00,300
we move forward
to a brave new world order

918
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:03,800
owned and operated by Saberling.

919
01:01:20,700 --> 01:01:21,900
We're too late.

920
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,700
We can still stop it if we download the
virus into Saber's computer. Let's go.

921
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:29,000
Cherries.

922
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:41,500
Cake! Oh, you're so beautiful!

923
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,400
Oh, come to Papa!

924
01:02:08,100 --> 01:02:11,900
It's all Saber, sir.
Is this enough probable cause?

925
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:17,000
Eyewitnesses report
common household appliances

926
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:20,700
- coming to life and chasing people...
- Those are Saberling appliances!

927
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:23,600
But they're just supposed to
communicate with each other.

928
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:35,400
- Bravo, Echo! Go! Go!
- Spread out!

929
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,700
What is that thing?

930
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:42,100
It's heading for the tripwire.

931
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,400
- It's got Hurley!
- Oh, hey guys!

932
01:02:47,300 --> 01:02:50,800
- What's it doing?
- Peppers. Casserole.

933
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,900
It's trying to figure out
how long to cook him.

934
01:02:52,800 --> 01:02:55,300
Cook me? Get me out of here!

935
01:02:56,000 --> 01:02:59,900
- Move it, Blaster!
- I don't want to be an appetizer!

936
01:02:59,800 --> 01:03:01,800
- We got to save him!
- Get me out!

937
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:04,300
Let's go to Plan B!

938
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:06,500
- Blaster, immobilize that thing!
- I'm on it!

939
01:03:06,500 --> 01:03:09,500
- Don't let it hit the tripwire!
- I want to go home!

940
01:03:10,800 --> 01:03:15,400
Soup. Eggs. Beef.

941
01:03:15,400 --> 01:03:19,100
- Oh, man! It's packing a toaster!
- Broccoli.

942
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:22,300
All teams, go, go!

943
01:03:25,400 --> 01:03:27,300
Why is this happening?

944
01:03:28,300 --> 01:03:30,100
This wasn't the plan!

945
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:32,700
- Saber, what's going on?
- Get us out of here!

946
01:03:33,500 --> 01:03:35,700
Take Saber down to the command truck!

947
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:39,500
Bacon. Carrot. Soup.

948
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:42,300
- Hurley, don't be scared.
- I'm not a chicken.

949
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,000
Chicken. Match.

950
01:03:46,900 --> 01:03:48,200
Not even close!

951
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:55,000
- Come on, Hurley!
- Just a little piece of cake!

952
01:03:57,800 --> 01:04:00,400
- Didn't drop the cake.
- Hurley, let's go!

953
01:04:02,200 --> 01:04:03,700
Hunk ofjunk!

954
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:06,500
It's gonna hit the tripwire!

955
01:04:12,700 --> 01:04:14,900
- Run for cover!
- Darwin, jump!

956
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:17,000
No!

957
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:43,600
Are you OK? We can't get through.

958
01:04:43,600 --> 01:04:45,500
I'm all right. I'm gonna keep going.

959
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:47,600
Not without us. No way.

960
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,500
There's no time.
I've got to take down the network core.

961
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:55,600
Hurley, I told you
stay put and guard the exfil.

962
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:58,600
Didn't I tell you that?
I thought I could depend on you.

963
01:05:00,000 --> 01:05:03,400
All right. Now let's huddle up.
Come on. Here's to the team.

964
01:05:09,100 --> 01:05:13,000
Good luck, Darwin.
We'll find another way through.

965
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:20,700
OK, this is good. Over there.

966
01:05:23,500 --> 01:05:24,800
Marcie, let's go.

967
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,300
I find it hard to believe
you've got nothing to do with this.

968
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,800
You have to believe me.
I don't know what's going on.

969
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:35,200
I only wanted to be the biggest
appliance manufacturer in the world.

970
01:05:37,400 --> 01:05:39,200
What do you want?
I got major problems here.

971
01:05:39,200 --> 01:05:42,400
There's your problem. The transmission's
coming off the core of his computer.

972
01:05:42,300 --> 01:05:44,500
- G-Force went in to shut it down.
- G-Force?

973
01:05:44,500 --> 01:05:47,100
You sent those gophers in
without my authorization?

974
01:05:47,100 --> 01:05:50,200
Sir, I'm picking up a video feed.
It's one of ours.

975
01:05:50,200 --> 01:05:51,500
Let's see it.

976
01:05:51,500 --> 01:05:53,600
- What in the heck is that?
- That's Darwin.

977
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,100
You say that like it's a good thing.

978
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:56,900
What's he gonna do,
gnaw his way out of there?

979
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:59,900
He's gonna insert a virus into
the core and take down the network.

980
01:06:08,300 --> 01:06:12,400
- Hello, Darwin.
- Speckles, you're alive.

981
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:16,700
You infiltrated the bad guy's lair.
Where is he?

982
01:06:16,500 --> 01:06:19,100
I am the bad guy.

983
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:23,200
What? You really think I let myself
get killed in a garbage truck?

984
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:27,400
Well, I hid in a soup can.
Rode it all the way to the city dump.

985
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:28,900
And it was stinky.

986
01:06:28,900 --> 01:06:32,600
- Speckles?
- I can't believe the mole was the mole.

987
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,000
Actually, you may call me Mr. Yanshu.

988
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,900
- No.
- Business associate of Leonard Saber.

989
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:43,300
You tricked Saber
into helping you build Clusterstorm?

990
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:45,100
How could you do this to us?

991
01:06:45,100 --> 01:06:48,300
I thought we were friends.
I put my life on the line for you.

992
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:52,100
Yanshu was in my basement
this whole time?

993
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,600
And he wasn't a man. He was a mole.

994
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:56,400
"Yanshu" is the Chinese word for mole.

995
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:57,900
Sabersense was just a cover.

996
01:06:59,900 --> 01:07:02,400
I created an army of robotic appliances,

997
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:06,200
and they created an array of
giant electromagnetic nodes...

998
01:07:06,100 --> 01:07:09,100
Nodes capable of pulling down all

999
01:07:09,100 --> 01:07:14,600
the space junk orbiting the planet,
and driving every human underground.

1000
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:20,200
- So, what do you think?
- You've betrayed us. You!

1001
01:07:20,000 --> 01:07:25,400
- You sabotaged our presentation.
- Extermination virus. Nasty stuff.

1002
01:07:25,200 --> 01:07:27,000
Speckles, why?

1003
01:07:28,300 --> 01:07:32,900
You ever Google the word "mole", Darwin?
Three million entries.

1004
01:07:32,800 --> 01:07:36,900
Not on how to care for 'em,
or love 'em, or pet 'em. No!

1005
01:07:36,800 --> 01:07:39,600
Three million entries
on how to exterminate them!

1006
01:07:40,600 --> 01:07:44,500
The humans came and destroyed
our home... destroyed our home.

1007
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:46,800
Son, if you ever get the chance

1008
01:07:46,800 --> 01:07:50,400
to bring mankind to its knees... do it.

1009
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:56,300
They showed us no mercy, Darwin.

1010
01:07:56,300 --> 01:07:59,400
Well, now it's my turn
to do a little pest control.

1011
01:07:59,300 --> 01:08:02,700
If you'll excuse me... it's showtime.

1012
01:08:03,800 --> 01:08:06,700
Going up!

1013
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,500
He's created some kind of monster.

1014
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:20,000
I think I'll stay here
and guard the exfil.

1015
01:08:20,200 --> 01:08:24,400
- What's our plan?
- Stop Speckles and save the world.

1016
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,800
That's more of a goal than a plan.

1017
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:38,700
It's working! Look out!
I'm feeling ten feet tall.

1018
01:08:47,600 --> 01:08:50,300
No place like home.
There's no place like home.

1019
01:08:50,500 --> 01:08:52,000
That'll leave a mark.

1020
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:55,500
Come on! We got to
get up there and stop Speckles.

1021
01:08:55,500 --> 01:08:57,700
How big is this thing going to get?

1022
01:08:59,600 --> 01:09:03,700
You humans stole my home!
Now I will steal yours.

1023
01:09:05,200 --> 01:09:06,400
Look out!

1024
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:11,300
Something is missing. Oh, I know!

1025
01:09:22,300 --> 01:09:23,900
Incoming!

1026
01:09:24,300 --> 01:09:28,800
Just like humans.
Bringing guns to a space junk fight.

1027
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:33,200
- Darwin!
- Speckles, shut this down, now!

1028
01:09:33,200 --> 01:09:36,200
- No.
- Then I'll shut you down.

1029
01:09:36,200 --> 01:09:40,200
I have no quarrel with you, Darwin,
but mankind must pay.

1030
01:09:40,700 --> 01:09:42,400
You know I can't let you do that.

1031
01:09:42,300 --> 01:09:44,600
Then you leave me no choice, my friend.

1032
01:09:51,500 --> 01:09:52,700
My parachute.

1033
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:00,400
The PDA!

1034
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:03,300
Go get it, girl.

1035
01:10:08,200 --> 01:10:09,500
No!

1036
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:36,700
Hurley, what are you doing?

1037
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:39,200
I gotta get you back up there.

1038
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:44,100
- No, Hurley! Don't do it.
- Go get him, bro! It's the only way!

1039
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,300
Coming, Hurley!

1040
01:10:58,600 --> 01:11:02,400
Take that! And that!
It's no fun being the little guy, is it?

1041
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:05,000
Everybody, hold on!

1042
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:07,900
Fall back!

1043
01:11:15,200 --> 01:11:17,000
Speckles, if you keep doing this

1044
01:11:17,100 --> 01:11:21,400
then you're no better than the humans
who destroyed your home and your family.

1045
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:25,300
Well, that's kind of the point here.
I lost my family.

1046
01:11:25,200 --> 01:11:27,800
No, you're wrong. We're your family.

1047
01:11:27,800 --> 01:11:31,400
Me and Blaster
and Juarez and Ben and Marcie.

1048
01:11:32,700 --> 01:11:36,800
Speckles, Ben took us in
when nobody else wanted us.

1049
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:38,800
And he made us a family.

1050
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:44,500
We're a family.

1051
01:11:48,100 --> 01:11:51,400
Oh, no! No! What have I done?
What have I done?

1052
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,500
It's too late, Darwin! I can't stop it!

1053
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
But we can.

1054
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:13,300
It's working! Darwin, it's working!

1055
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:16,600
Speckles, come with me.

1056
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:24,500
I got you!

1057
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:45,800
We've gotta find Hurley.

1058
01:12:51,600 --> 01:12:53,900
- Hold it right there.
- We'll take him from here.

1059
01:12:53,900 --> 01:12:55,600
Relax, guys. He's code four.

1060
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,100
- What a mess.
- There you go. Easy.

1061
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:04,500
- Darwin, over here!
- Hang on!

1062
01:13:05,900 --> 01:13:08,300
- I got him. I got him.
- I can't hold it much longer.

1063
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,200
No, Hurley.

1064
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:15,900
No, not you, Hurley.

1065
01:13:15,900 --> 01:13:18,600
Look, he landed next to his cake.

1066
01:13:19,600 --> 01:13:20,600
No.

1067
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:23,400
Oh, man, Hurley.

1068
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,800
- Hurley.
- Oh, no.

1069
01:13:27,800 --> 01:13:31,300
No. No. This is all my fault.

1070
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,700
He was my man.

1071
01:13:33,800 --> 01:13:36,300
Hurley, wake up, pal.

1072
01:13:37,700 --> 01:13:39,100
Listen, I just...

1073
01:13:39,100 --> 01:13:43,400
I just wanted you to know you
were as good as anyone out there today.

1074
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:46,600
I don't know what they call it
back in the pet shop,

1075
01:13:46,500 --> 01:13:50,100
but out here we...
well, we call it being a hero.

1076
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:53,600
All you ever wanted was a family.

1077
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:55,400
I never got to tell you this, but...

1078
01:13:56,000 --> 01:13:59,900
I'd be proud...
proud to call you my brother.

1079
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,900
Hurley.

1080
01:14:10,100 --> 01:14:12,700
Hey, I think I saw his nose twitch.

1081
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:19,100
Hurley?

1082
01:14:20,100 --> 01:14:23,400
Did you mean it
when you called me "brother?"

1083
01:14:23,300 --> 01:14:26,000
Not exactly. I was just...
That was like a figurative...

1084
01:14:28,000 --> 01:14:33,100
- You bet I did.
- Brother. I have a brother!

1085
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,700
This is great!

1086
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,600
We can spend every
Thanksgiving together,

1087
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:39,400
take road trips to Vegas,
have tickle fights!

1088
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,300
Oh, come here. Give me a hug, bro.

1089
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:48,400
Oh, this is great!

1090
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:57,400
So, Hurley.
You still want to be a part of the team?

1091
01:15:01,600 --> 01:15:02,900
Two...

1092
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:04,800
Three...

1093
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:06,700
Twenty-seven!

1094
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:09,900
- Hurley. I'm right here watching you.
- Thirty-two.

1095
01:15:09,900 --> 01:15:12,700
OK, that's it.
I don't want to get too buff.

1096
01:15:12,700 --> 01:15:14,200
Not to worry.

1097
01:15:16,200 --> 01:15:19,800
Alrighty, guys.
Welcome to your new home.

1098
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:23,200
OK, but I'm telling you now,
I don't do well with roommates.

1099
01:15:23,200 --> 01:15:26,600
- Easy there, tiger.
- Everybody, out! Everybody, out!

1100
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:28,400
Jail break! Jail break!

1101
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:34,800
Look, Juarez, I gotta know.
Which one of us are you interested in?

1102
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:38,300
No, no, Blaster! You've gotta ask her
who she's not interested in.

1103
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,000
Thirty, 42, 83.

1104
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:43,300
As far as I can tell,
you're not interested in either of us,

1105
01:15:43,300 --> 01:15:46,700
which means either
you want both of us or neither of us,

1106
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:50,300
which leaves us desperate
even though we don't have a clue!

1107
01:15:50,300 --> 01:15:52,500
And that's just how I like it.

1108
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:56,800
Hey, guys? It's the Director of the FBI.

1109
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:01,100
G-Force. I want you to know
that Leonard Saber

1110
01:16:01,100 --> 01:16:05,600
has been forced to undertake the largest
recall of consumer products in history.

1111
01:16:05,500 --> 01:16:09,100
And he's getting help from somebody
quite knowledgeable about the defects.

1112
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:13,900
Three down, 178,000 to go.

1113
01:16:14,600 --> 01:16:16,700
I think I'm gonna be here awhile.

1114
01:16:16,700 --> 01:16:20,800
But I'm gonna rejoin the team
when I'm done. If they'll have me.

1115
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:25,000
Your friend, Agent Killian, has been
reassigned. He has a few words for you.

1116
01:16:26,300 --> 01:16:28,000
Hello, G-Force.

1117
01:16:28,400 --> 01:16:31,100
Look! A frozen FBI-cicle.

1118
01:16:33,300 --> 01:16:35,200
I'm sorry that I doubted you.

1119
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:39,400
How long do I have to stay down here?
It's really cold!

1120
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:42,400
Team. As the full details
of your valour come to light,

1121
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:47,700
it is an honour and a privilege to say
"thank you" on behalf of this country.

1122
01:16:47,600 --> 01:16:51,700
You guinea pigs pack more courage and
heart into those teensy little frames

1123
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:53,600
than any agents I've ever seen.

1124
01:16:53,900 --> 01:16:59,100
G-Force, your funding has been restored.
Welcome to the FBI.

1125
01:16:59,800 --> 01:17:02,500
Guys... we got our badges.

1126
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:07,400
- Yeah, boy! We're official-tishal now!
- Finally!

1127
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:14,200
Not bad for a runt.

1128
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:17,100
Thanks for believing in me, Ben.

1129
01:17:21,700 --> 01:17:23,400
Hurley, I've been thinking...

1130
01:17:23,400 --> 01:17:26,700
If you're gonna be out there
helping us save the world,

1131
01:17:26,600 --> 01:17:29,800
you're gonna need this.
You're one of us now.

1132
01:17:29,700 --> 01:17:33,800
My very own badge
and a new name! Rookie!

1133
01:17:33,800 --> 01:17:38,900
- So we're finally agents.
- No, special agents.

1134
01:17:40,800 --> 01:17:51,200
Let's get this party started right!

1135
01:17:50,700 --> 01:17:54,600
Get him on the good foot!
All right, Hurley!

1136
01:18:00,100 --> 01:18:01,600
G-Force in the house!

1137
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:19,900
My turn! My turn!

1138
01:18:32,700 --> 01:18:36,700
Hey, boys!
This ferret can dance, right? Right?

1139
01:18:36,700 --> 01:18:37,900
Wrong!

1140
01:18:38,600 --> 01:18:39,700
Oh, Bucky!

1141
01:18:39,800 --> 01:18:42,000
Oh, yeah!

1142
01:19:17,200 --> 01:19:19,600
I'm a mole. I got a thing for worms.

1143
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:25,700
Good thing I took shop.

1144
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:28,300
Cherries.

1145
01:19:30,000 --> 01:19:33,800
Oh, my gosh.
I look like Paris Hilton's chihuahua.

1146
01:19:34,200 --> 01:19:39,000
Yes! Yes! I am out, baby!
Finally, the recognition I deserve.

1147
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,500
I'm Jeff Gordon! With fur!
