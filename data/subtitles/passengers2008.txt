00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,564
<i>Good morning, James.</i>

2
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,841
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

3
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,127
Wait. What?

4
00:04:30,519 --> 00:04:33,284
<i>It's perfectly normal to feel confused.</i>

5
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,920
<i>You just spent 120 years
in suspended animation.</i>

6
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:38,521
What?

7
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,324
<i>It's okay, James.</i>

8
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:42,882
- It's Jim.
<i>- Jim.</i>

9
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,689
<i>Just breathe. Everything is okay.</i>

10
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,086
Where am I?

11
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:50,242
<i>You're a passenger on the</i> Starship Avalon,

12
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:53,961
<i>the Homestead Company's
premier interstellar starliner.</i>

13
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:58,687
<i>We've nearly completed the voyage
from Earth to your new home.</i>

14
00:04:59,079 --> 00:05:01,127
<i>The colony world of Homestead II.</i>

15
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,971
<i>A new world. A fresh start.</i>

16
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,564
<i>Room to grow.</i>

17
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,324
Oh, yeah.

18
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,447
<i>The</i> Avalon <i>is on final approach.</i>

19
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:12,601
<i>For the next four months,
you'll enjoy space travel</i>

20
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,569
<i>at its most luxurious.</i>

21
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,560
<i>Food. Fun. Friends.</i>

22
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,086
- My friends.
<i>- That's right, Jim.</i>

23
00:05:20,439 --> 00:05:23,523
<i>The ID band on your wrist is your key
to the wonders of the</i> Avalon.

24
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,889
<i>You're in perfect health, Jim.</i>

25
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:30,485
<i>Let's get you to your cabin,
where you can get some rest.</i>

26
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,896
<i>You may be experiencing</i>

27
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:41,365
<i>post-hibernation sickness.</i>

28
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:45,961
<i>Your door will illuminate for you.</i>

29
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:50,531
<i>Welcome to your cabin,</i>

30
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,920
<i>your home until we make landfall.</i>

31
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,120
<i>Over the next four months,</i>

32
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:57,090
<i>you'll prepare for your new life

00:05:57,519 --> 00:06:00,649
<i>meet your fellow passengers,
take skill-building classes,</i>

34
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,608
<i>and learn about colonial living.</i>

35
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,521
<i>You've been assigned to learning group 38</i>

36
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,728
<i>for passengers with engineering
and technical trade skills.</i>

37
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,526
<i>Please scan your ID
to confirm luggage delivery.</i>

38
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,406
<i>Jim.</i>

39
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:17,165
<i>Please scan your ID
to confirm luggage delivery.</i>

40
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,327
<i>To help you recover from hibernation,
be sure to drink plenty of fluids.</i>

41
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:30,565
<i>Enjoy the rest of your
voyage on the</i> Avalon,

42
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,802
<i>a Homestead Company Starship.</i>

43
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,884
<i>Good morning, one and all.</i>

44
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,605
<i>It's a beautiful morning
here on the</i> Starship Avalon.

45
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,411
<i>Whatever you do, don't get homesick,
get Homestead.</i>

46
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:44,816
<i>Let's start things off
with one of my favorites back on Earth.</i>

47
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:47,161
<i>Once upon a time
You dressed so fine</i>

48
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,606
<i>Threw the bums a dime in your prime</i>

49
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,571
<i>Didn't you?</i>

50
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,091
No.

51
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:57,529
That's stupid.

52
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,569
Just own it. Own it, Jim.
You got a cool jacket.

53
00:07:18,839 --> 00:07:20,524
<i>Hello, passengers.</i>

54
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,163
<i>Will you all please take a seat.</i>

55
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,449
<i>Welcome, learning group 38.</i>

56
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:30,204
<i>Your introduction to colonial life.</i>

57
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,441
<i>Earth is a prosperous planet,
the cradle of civilization.</i>

58
00:07:34,879 --> 00:07:39,680
<i>But for many, it's also overpopulated,
overpriced, overrated.</i>

59
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,442
I'm sorry, I think I may be in the wrong...

60
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:44,329
<i>Hold all questions till the end, please.</i>

61
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,441
Oh, sorry.

62
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:48,409
<i>The colonies offer an alternative,
a better way of life.</i>

63
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,641
Where are all the other...

64
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:53,769
<i>And there's no colony
more beautiful than Homestead II,</i>

65
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,762
<i>the jewel of the occupied world.</i>

66
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:57,204
I'm sorry.

67
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,485
Where is everybody?

68
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,007
<i>We are all on the</i> Starship Avalon.

69
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,444
But I'm the only one here.

70
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:06,649
<i>There are 5,000 passengers
and 258 crew members.</i>

71
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,406
So why am I alone?

72
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,762
<i>We're all in this together.</i>

73
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:13,920
<i>Hello?</i>

74
00:08:15,879 --> 00:08:17,211
Anybody here?

75
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,050
Hello?

76
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:33,049
<i>Please buckle up
and secure any loose items.</i>

77
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,841
<i>This elevator will experience
a momentary lapse in gravity.</i>

78
00:08:59,879 --> 00:09:01,769
<i>Grand concourse.</i>

79
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,841
<i>Hello.</i>

80
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:19,006
<i>Welcome to the grand concourse
aboard the</i> Avalon.

81
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,280
<i>Can I help you?</i>

82
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:23,082
I need to talk to a person.

83
00:09:23,159 --> 00:09:24,809
A real live person, please?

84
00:09:24,879 --> 00:09:27,086
<i>What sort of person?
Personal trainer? Travel planner?</i>

85
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,769
<i>- Therapist?</i>
- I... I don't know.

86
00:09:28,879 --> 00:09:30,245
Somebody in charge.

87
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,129
<i>The ship's steward
handles passenger affairs.</i>

88
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,327
<i>It's on level three of the grand concourse.</i>

89
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,084
- Thank you.
<i>- Happy to help.</i>

90
00:09:41,799 --> 00:09:42,801
Not good.

91
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,816
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Who's flying the ship?

92
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,816
<i>The flight crew, the captain, the pilot,
the chief navigator...</i>

93
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,922
Captain. I want to speak to the captain.

94
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,842
<i>The captain rarely handles
passenger queries...</i>

95
00:09:50,919 --> 00:09:52,683
It's an emergency! Please.

96
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:56,447
<i>The captain is usually found on
the bridge, in the command ring.</i>

97
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:09,844
<i>Bridge access requires
special authorization.</i>

98
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:14,690
<i>Bridge access requires
special authorization.</i>

99
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,961
You got to be kidding me.

100
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:35,601
<i>Welcome to the observatory.</i>

101
00:10:37,559 --> 00:10:40,039
<i>What can I show you?</i>

102
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:42,248
We're supposed to land soon.

103
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:47,889
I'm... I'm the only one awake.

104
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,559
<i>I don't understand. What can I show you?</i>

105
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,650
Show me Homestead II.

106
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:56,769
<i>Homestead II is the fourth planet
in the Bhakti System.</i>

107
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,326
Right. And where are we?

108
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:02,403
<i>We're in transit from
Earth to Homestead II.</i>

109
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:05,325
<i>We will arrive in approximately 90 years.</i>

110
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:06,399
What?

111
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:09,841
<i>We arrive at Homestead II
in 90 years, three weeks and one day.</i>

112
00:11:09,919 --> 00:11:11,081
No. Wait.

113
00:11:11,159 --> 00:11:12,764
How long ago did we leave Earth?

114
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:15,320
<i>Approximately 30 years ago.</i>

115
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:21,640
I woke up too soon.

116
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,009
<i>Hello.</i>

117
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,690
How do I send a message to Earth?

118
00:11:26,759 --> 00:11:29,161
<i>Interstellar messages are
sent by laser array.</i>

119
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:30,684
<i>This is an expensive service.</i>

120
00:11:30,759 --> 00:11:32,443
- Bite me.
<i>- Happy to help.</i>

121
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,639
<i>Planet and connection?</i>

122
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,802
Earth. The Homestead Company.

123
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:43,288
<i>There are 30,826 contacts
listed under Homestead Company.</i>

124
00:11:43,919 --> 00:11:46,923
I'm emigrating to Homestead II
and I have an emergency.

125
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,206
<i>I have a customer help line.</i>

126
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,280
Sounds about right.

127
00:11:49,679 --> 00:11:50,681
<i>Begin message.</i>

128
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,730
Hi. Uh, I'm Jim Preston.

129
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,044
I'm a passenger on the <i>Avalon.</i>

130
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,205
I, uh...

131
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:05,124
I think something went wrong
with my hibernation pod.

132
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,565
<i>I woke up too soon.</i>

133
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,326
<i>And I mean, way too soon.</i>

134
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:13,051
<i>Nobody else is awake, and...</i>

135
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:15,364
<i>I don't know how to get back to sleep.</i>

136
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,568
And the thing is, there's 90 years to go.

137
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,411
At this rate, I'm...

138
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:30,365
I'm sorry, I'm trying to fix this.

139
00:12:30,559 --> 00:12:33,484
Maybe I missed something.
I could use a hand.

140
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,524
That's all.

141
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,366
Thank you.

142
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,290
<i>Message sent.</i>

143
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,486
Outstanding.

144
00:12:43,559 --> 00:12:45,846
<i>Message will arrive in 19 years.</i>

145
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,047
Wait, what?

146
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:49,282
<i>Earliest reply in 55 years.</i>

147
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:51,847
Fifty-five years?

148
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,201
<i>We apologize for the delay.</i>

149
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,806
<i>That will be $6,012.</i>

150
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:08,409
<i>Call me irresponsible</i>

151
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:12,644
- Afternoon.
- Oh, man!

152
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,802
Is it good to see another face!

153
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,730
Thought I was the only one awake.

154
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:19,923
Who wants to sleep
on a beautiful day like this?

155
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:22,923
No, I mean we're in trouble.
We're not supposed to be here.

156
00:13:23,159 --> 00:13:25,048
Well, I won't tell if you don't.

157
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,768
- Huh?
- Our little secret.

158
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:30,686
What can I get for you?

159
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:31,880
What?

160
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,445
You look like a whiskey man.

161
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:35,519
Uh, okay.

162
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:41,845
Oh, you're a robot.

163
00:13:42,559 --> 00:13:44,767
Android. Technically.

164
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,360
Arthur's the name.

165
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,841
- Jim.
- Pleased to meet you, Jim.

166
00:13:57,919 --> 00:13:59,604
How much do you know about this ship?

167
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,571
I don't know.

168
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:02,721
I know some things.

169
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:05,240
What do I do
if my hibernation pod malfunctions?

170
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,799
Oh, hibernation pods are fail-safe.

171
00:14:07,879 --> 00:14:09,211
They never malfunction.

172
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:10,485
Well, I woke up early.

173
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,000
Can't happen.

174
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:14,523
How long until we get to Homestead II?

175
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,442
About 90 years or so.

176
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:18,536
And when are all the passengers
supposed to wake up?

177
00:14:18,559 --> 00:14:20,403
Not till the last four months.

178
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,562
How is it that I'm sitting here with you

179
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,849
with 90 years to go?

180
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:29,803
Hmm?

181
00:14:30,279 --> 00:14:31,804
It's not possible for you to be here.

182
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:36,205
Well, I am.

183
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,571
<i>Good morning.
It's a beautiful day here on the</i> Avalon.

184
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:46,928
<i>So wake up, sunshine.
It's time to relax and enjoy your stay.</i>

185
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,889
<i>Please make a selection.</i>

186
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:05,850
<i>Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino Extreme
is reserved for gold-class passengers.</i>

187
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:08,490
<i>Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino Extreme
is reserved for...</i>

188
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:10,000
I want the Mocha Cappuccino Extreme.

189
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,086
Bill my room, please.

190
00:15:11,159 --> 00:15:12,730
<i>Food can be purchased in the ship's...</i>

191
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,289
<i>Sorry. The French Roast...</i>

192
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,725
<i>Sorry. The Pumpkin Spice...</i>

193
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,400
<i>Sorry. Vanilla Chai...</i>

194
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,759
<i>Sorry. Sorry.</i>

195
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,888
<i>Sorry.</i>

196
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,961
<i>Large coffee.</i>

197
00:15:22,039 --> 00:15:24,008
- Cream...
<i>- Please enjoy your coffee.</i>

198
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:25,520
Oh, really?

199
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,525
<i>Crew pod room access
requires special authorization.</i>

200
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:35,605
<i>Grand...</i>

201
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,681
<i>Going...</i>

202
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:38,565
<i>Please make... Level...</i>

203
00:17:40,519 --> 00:17:42,203
<i>Grand concourse.</i>

204
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,405
<i>I'm screwed, Arthur.</i>

205
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,083
Completely and ridiculously screwed.

206
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,490
Come on, now.

207
00:17:47,559 --> 00:17:49,607
Every cloud has a silver lining.

208
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:54,650
Guess I am gonna die of
old age on this ship.

209
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,204
Oh, we all die.

210
00:17:56,920 --> 00:17:59,319
Even androids end up on the scrap heap.

211
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:02,320
I'm your only customer.
Why are you always polishing a glass?

212
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,930
Trick of the trade.

213
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,651
Makes people nervous
when a bartender just stands there.

214
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,289
So lay some bartender wisdom on me.

215
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,163
I'm lost in space here.

216
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,965
You're not where you want to be.

217
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:18,566
You feel like you're supposed
to be somewhere else.

218
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,080
You said it.

219
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:25,929
Well, say you could snap your fingers

220
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,441
and be wherever you wanted to be.

221
00:18:28,519 --> 00:18:30,284
I bet you'd still feel this way.

222
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,085
Not in the right place.

223
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,960
Point is, you can't get so hung up
on where you'd rather be

224
00:18:36,039 --> 00:18:38,280
that you forget how to make
the most of where you are.

225
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,404
What are you telling me?

226
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,528
Take a break from worrying
about what you can't control.

227
00:18:45,319 --> 00:18:46,366
Live a little.

228
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:49,169
Live a little.

229
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,810
<i>Welcome to the Vienna Suite.</i>

230
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,881
Oh.

231
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,569
Oh, yeah.

232
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,564
Huh.

233
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,845
What?

234
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:15,971
Ah!

235
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:19,402
<i>- Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!</i>
- Yeah!

236
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,005
Make that a double jumbo shrimp.

237
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:23,401
Triple.

238
00:19:24,759 --> 00:19:25,760
Dance-off.

239
00:19:28,079 --> 00:19:29,525
All right.

240
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:32,839
I did exactly what you just did.

241
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,802
<i>Large coffee.</i>

242
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,930
<i>You have had many, señor.</i>

243
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:52,681
<i>Sí, señor.</i>

244
00:19:53,279 --> 00:19:54,280
<i>Gracias.</i>

245
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,645
<i>Come on, come on</i>

246
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,290
<i>Oh, yeah!
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!</i>

247
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:04,651
<i>A little less conversation
A little more action, please</i>

248
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,489
Get out of here!

249
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:11,359
Come back. Hey.

250
00:20:14,079 --> 00:20:15,126
Come here.

251
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,410
<i>Welcome, Jim.</i>

252
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,171
<i>Please turn your attention</i>

253
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,482
<i>to the screens displaying safety tips.</i>

254
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:22,848
<i>These spacesuits are designed to withstand
the harsh environment of space.</i>

255
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:25,126
<i>The carbon fiber and polyamide construction</i>

256
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,567
<i>means your suit is both
flexible and durable.</i>

257
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,730
<i>Remember,
your spacesuit is your lifeline.</i>

258
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:56,720
<i>Slide the handle on the right
to release the air pressure.</i>

259
00:21:58,079 --> 00:22:00,366
<i>Your magnetic boots are now engaged.</i>

260
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:02,799
<i>They can be deactivated
using the control panel on your arm.</i>

261
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:06,326
<i>Press the red button
to open the airlock door.</i>

262
00:22:10,319 --> 00:22:12,084
<i>Have a wonderful time.</i>

263
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:20,646
<i>Tether attached.</i>

264
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,684
<i>Welcome back, Jim.</i>

265
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:56,481
<i>We hope you decide to join us again soon</i>

266
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,926
<i>for another thrilling experience.</i>

267
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,843
<i>Have a wonderful time.</i>

268
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,049
Aurora.

269
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:50,842
<i>Searching passenger profiles.</i>

270
00:25:51,119 --> 00:25:52,884
<i>I'm Aurora Lane.</i>

271
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,930
<i>Passenger 1456. I'm a writer.</i>

272
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:57,730
<i>I think we tell each other stories</i>

273
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:00,484
<i>to know we're not alone, to make contact.</i>

274
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:04,087
<i>Your father was Oliver Lane,
a Pulitzer Prize-winning author.</i>

275
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,445
<i>No pressure, right?</i>

276
00:26:05,519 --> 00:26:08,922
<i>My dad used to say,
"If you live an ordinary life,</i>

277
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,287
<i>"all you'll have are ordinary stories.</i>

278
00:26:11,359 --> 00:26:13,521
<i>"You have to live a life of adventure."</i>

279
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,564
<i>So...</i>

280
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:17,721
<i>Here I am.</i>

281
00:26:24,759 --> 00:26:26,329
Good morning.

282
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:31,809
<i>We're starting over in every way.</i>

283
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:35,050
<i>I'll have to figure out
where to live, how to live,</i>

284
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:36,644
<i>Who my friends will be.</i>

285
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,056
<i>It's like the first day of school.</i>

286
00:26:38,079 --> 00:26:40,319
<i>If the school bus took 120
years to get there.</i>

287
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,282
<i>We're creating a culture...</i>

288
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,487
You are funny.

289
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:49,290
Do you ever read something
and feel like it's written just for you?

290
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,883
I don't do a lot of reading.

291
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:53,723
She's good.

292
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:55,971
Who's that?

293
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:58,167
- Aurora.
- Ah...

294
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,086
The sleeping girl.

295
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,208
You know, I'm not saying
the universe is evil,

296
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,088
but it sure has a nasty sense of humor.

297
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,161
How is that?

298
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:12,766
You get to fly to another planet,

299
00:27:12,839 --> 00:27:15,319
but you'll die along the way.

300
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:18,880
And you find the perfect woman

301
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,969
right in front of you...

302
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,923
Yet she's completely out of reach.

303
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,243
<i>Yeah, I'll miss New York City.</i>

304
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:32,935
<i>Give me a cup of coffee
and a view of the Chrysler Building,</i>

305
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,200
<i>and I can write all day.</i>

306
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:36,776
<i>They do have coffee on Homestead II, right?</i>

307
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:37,846
<i>They better have coffee.</i>

308
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,287
<i>If they don't, I have to turn around
and come back to Earth.</i>

309
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,528
<i>Is there anything
you regret leaving behind?</i>

310
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:48,282
<i>Yeah, I'll miss the trees
in Central Park turning in the fall.</i>

311
00:27:49,599 --> 00:27:51,125
<i>I'll also miss crowds...</i>

312
00:28:00,839 --> 00:28:02,604
Say you were trapped on a desert island,

313
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,931
and you had the power
to wish somebody there with you.

314
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,808
You wouldn't be alone anymore.

315
00:28:08,759 --> 00:28:10,922
But you'd be stranding the person
on the island.

316
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:13,441
How do... Would you make that wish?

317
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:15,886
I don't know. I've never been on an island.

318
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,609
Okay, well, yeah.

319
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,609
Uh... Forget the island.

320
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:25,125
Let's say you figured out
how to do something

321
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:27,496
that would make your life
a million times better,

322
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:30,125
but you knew it was wrong
and there's no taking it back.

323
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,280
How do you do the math?

324
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:33,728
Jim, these are not robot questions.

325
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,724
I know how to wake Aurora up.

326
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:44,530
Oh. Well, that seems like a fine idea.

327
00:28:44,599 --> 00:28:45,681
You could use some company.

328
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:48,486
I'd be stranding her on this ship
for the rest of her life.

329
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:50,767
Oh. Well, you can't do that.

330
00:28:52,319 --> 00:28:53,526
What am I gonna do?

331
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,085
I'm here for you.

332
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,969
Arthur, you're a machine.

333
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:04,324
See? You can't feel that.
You don't have feelings.

334
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,361
See?

335
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:10,124
That doesn't hurt.

336
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,201
And you don't even mind.

337
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,325
'Cause you're not a person.

338
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,441
Don't even think about it.

339
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:24,931
No more Aurora talk.

340
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,444
I'm over it.

341
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,961
I'm moving on.

342
00:29:29,319 --> 00:29:31,128
Don't even think about it!

343
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,135
What am I gonna do?
I'm just gonna sit and think about it?

344
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,695
I'm not... I can't think about it,
so I'm not going to.

345
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:36,563
That's the deal. I've made my decision.

346
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:37,641
I know what I'm doing.

347
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:39,519
I just cut it off.

348
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:43,096
I'm not... No more.

349
00:29:43,119 --> 00:29:44,736
You won't hear me bring up her name again.

350
00:29:44,759 --> 00:29:46,319
I'll never even mention her name again.

351
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
Done.

352
00:29:50,519 --> 00:29:52,203
You can't do it.

353
00:29:57,359 --> 00:29:58,805
Shaving off my beard.

354
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:11,563
Please don't do it.

355
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,444
<i>Good morning, Aurora.</i>

356
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:07,682
<i>How are you feeling?</i>

357
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:10,569
<i>It's perfectly normal to feel confused.</i>

358
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:13,762
<i>You just spent 120 years
in suspended animation.</i>

359
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:04,208
<i>Grand concourse.</i>

360
00:33:04,279 --> 00:33:05,724
Hello?

361
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,480
Anybody?

362
00:33:19,359 --> 00:33:20,361
Hello.

363
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,240
Hi.

364
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:30,409
Are you passenger or crew?

365
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:34,284
Passenger.

366
00:33:34,359 --> 00:33:35,520
Jim Preston.

367
00:33:35,599 --> 00:33:37,250
Aurora Lane.

368
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,449
Do you know what's going on?

369
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:42,442
Nobody else from my row woke up.

370
00:33:43,759 --> 00:33:44,840
Same for me.

371
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,644
The crew's supposed to wake up
a month before we do,

372
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,483
but I haven't seen anybody.

373
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:54,890
The crew is still asleep.

374
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,689
Are you saying nobody's awake?

375
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:00,446
Just me.

376
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:01,961
Just you?

377
00:34:02,119 --> 00:34:03,405
It's just us.

378
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:06,767
But somebody's got to land the ship
in a few weeks.

379
00:34:07,599 --> 00:34:10,887
<i>We will arrive in approximately 89 years.</i>

380
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,121
Eighty-nine years?

381
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,284
The other passengers aren't late waking up.

382
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,443
We were early.

383
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:28,327
We... We need help.

384
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,639
Where's the crew?

385
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,965
The crew's in a secure
hibernation room.

386
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:36,327
Everything important, the controls,
the reactors, the engines...

387
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,003
It's all behind firewalls.

388
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,764
There's no way through.

389
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:52,487
How long have you been awake?

390
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:54,889
A year and three weeks.

391
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:58,371
No. No, no, no.

392
00:34:59,199 --> 00:35:00,644
No, this can't be happening.

393
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:03,208
We have to go back to sleep.

394
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,210
Aurora, we can't.

395
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:11,367
We just have to get back to our pods
and start them up again.

396
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:15,291
I can't find my pod.
I can't find my pod.

397
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:17,601
I can't find my pod. I don't know which...

398
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:19,170
It doesn't matter.

399
00:35:20,239 --> 00:35:21,809
- Aurora...
- I can't find it!

400
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,695
- Stop. Aurora...
- I can't find which one is mine!

401
00:35:23,719 --> 00:35:25,369
- Stop.
- I don't know which one is mine!

402
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,559
- I'll help you.
- I can't...

403
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:29,126
Stop! It doesn't matter.

404
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:35,081
Putting somebody into hibernation
requires special equipment.

405
00:35:35,719 --> 00:35:37,643
Remember the facility
where they put us under,

406
00:35:37,719 --> 00:35:40,086
all the procedures we went through?

407
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,447
These pods are designed
to keep us in hibernation,

408
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:44,045
to wake us up at the right time,

409
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:45,764
but they can't put us back to sleep.

410
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,724
You don't think there's a way
back into hibernation?

411
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:51,605
No.

412
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:53,250
But there has to be.

413
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:55,525
There has to be.

414
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:07,164
9:00. Nighttime.

415
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:15,083
I know I should be
working the problem, but...

416
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,523
I can't even keep my eyes open.

417
00:36:18,639 --> 00:36:20,483
You just came out of hibernation.

418
00:36:20,559 --> 00:36:23,005
It's going to be a couple of days
before you're 100%.

419
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:24,525
You should get some rest.

420
00:36:25,719 --> 00:36:27,324
Think I'm gonna have to.

421
00:36:28,679 --> 00:36:30,010
I'll walk you to your cabin.

422
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:32,606
No, it's okay. I'll be all right.

423
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,481
Okay.

424
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:39,407
Good night, Aurora.

425
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:43,242
More than a year?

426
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,128
I can't imagine.

427
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:47,364
It must have been so hard for you.

428
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:49,925
It was.

429
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,445
Good night, Jim.

430
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:56,329
<i>Please buckle up and secure
any loose items.</i>

431
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:01,960
- Whiskey, neat.
- Sure thing.

432
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:09,126
How's your day been?

433
00:37:10,960 --> 00:37:12,121
Aurora's awake.

434
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,003
Congratulations.

435
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:17,764
You don't look happy.

436
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,610
Arthur, can you keep a secret?

437
00:37:23,719 --> 00:37:25,210
Jim...

438
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,851
I'm not just a bartender, I'm a gentleman.

439
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,800
Don't tell Aurora that I woke her up.

440
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:35,599
She thinks it was an accident.
Let me tell her.

441
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,251
Of course.

442
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,175
How can there be no way
to put someone back into hibernation?

443
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:54,610
What if a pod breaks down?

444
00:37:54,679 --> 00:37:56,443
<i>No hibernation pod has malfunctioned</i>

445
00:37:56,519 --> 00:37:58,806
<i>in thousands of interstellar flights.</i>

446
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:02,050
Well, I'm awake.

447
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:04,407
<i>Hibernation pods are fail-safe.</i>

448
00:38:05,039 --> 00:38:06,280
Good morning.

449
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,284
- Have you eaten?
- No. I'm starving.

450
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,681
And this is the dumbest machine.

451
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:13,324
<i>Happy to help.</i>

452
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:28,045
<i>Gold-class breakfast.</i>

453
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:40,204
Well, you're a man of simple tastes.

454
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,961
I'm not a gold-class passenger.

455
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:47,407
French breakfast puffs above my pay grade.

456
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:48,969
What? This whole time?

457
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:50,804
- Yeah.
- What can I get you?

458
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,847
- No. No, I'm fine.
- Stop it.

459
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:54,728
Really. Okay.

460
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,771
Here you go.

461
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:03,681
Yeah.

462
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,483
So, I was thinking,
maybe there's another way to go to sleep.

463
00:39:07,559 --> 00:39:08,766
What about the infirmary?

464
00:39:08,840 --> 00:39:11,240
I checked it out.
It's just scanners and an Autodoc.

465
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:13,766
There could be another hibernation machine
in the cargo hold.

466
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,965
I had that thought, too.

467
00:39:15,239 --> 00:39:16,376
And then I read the manifest.

468
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,447
It's mostly farming stuff,
machines and trade goods.

469
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,166
Replacement parts
for computers and engineering.

470
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:23,606
We're not gonna find
a hibernation facility in a box.

471
00:39:23,679 --> 00:39:25,409
- We could build our own.
- We can't.

472
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,599
Jim, you're not even trying.

473
00:39:26,639 --> 00:39:28,960
I have tried everything.

474
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:31,043
For over a year, I...

475
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,405
I tried everything.

476
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:34,925
Well...

477
00:39:36,559 --> 00:39:38,085
Well, I'm not ready to give up.

478
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,244
<i>Infirmary.</i>

479
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:59,804
What about research articles?
Any kind of technical documents.

480
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:02,485
<i>Hibernation technology is proprietary.</i>

481
00:40:02,559 --> 00:40:06,280
<i>The following articles deal with the
subject on a theoretical level.</i>

482
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:51,887
New file. My voyage.

483
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:56,726
I boarded the <i>Avalon</i> with an idea,
a destination.

484
00:40:57,519 --> 00:41:00,887
Both now out of reach.

485
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,889
<i>I've been awake for seven days.</i>

486
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:07,967
<i>Awake far too soon.</i>

487
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,567
And I may well spend the
rest of my life here,

488
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:15,159
<i>in a steel world 1,000 meters long.</i>

489
00:41:16,559 --> 00:41:20,929
<i>There's another passenger awake,
a mechanic named Jim Preston.</i>

490
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:25,731
He seems to have accepted our fate.

491
00:41:26,559 --> 00:41:28,402
<i>But I'm scared.</i>

492
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:31,010
<i>I'm fighting to stay calm.</i>

493
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,240
<i>All the other passengers will sleep</i>

494
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,322
<i>for another 90 years</i>

495
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:42,166
<i>while I live out my life on this ship,</i>

496
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,648
<i>traveling forever...</i>

497
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:47,483
<i>Never arriving...</i>

498
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,806
<i>My only companion a total stranger.</i>

499
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,121
Why did you do it?

500
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:04,840
Do what?

501
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,960
Emigrate. Leave Earth.

502
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,576
I'm interviewing you.

503
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:12,601
You're what?

504
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,286
You were the first hibernation failure
in the history of space travel.

505
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,440
That makes you a story.

506
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:19,851
Who you gonna tell?

507
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,081
Posterity.

508
00:42:21,159 --> 00:42:23,969
So, why did you give up your life on Earth?

509
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:28,365
120-year space hibernation means
you'll never see your family or friends again.

510
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:32,771
You'll wake up in a new century
on a new planet.

511
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,568
It's the ultimate geographical suicide.

512
00:42:35,119 --> 00:42:37,407
Well, I could ask you the same thing.

513
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:39,322
But it's my interview.

514
00:42:39,679 --> 00:42:41,603
Were you running away from something?

515
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:43,329
No.

516
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,721
- Everything was okay.
- So?

517
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:47,295
Well, I guess I just wanted a new world,

518
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,481
I don't know, a fresh start.

519
00:42:48,639 --> 00:42:50,563
That's Homestead Company advertising.

520
00:42:50,639 --> 00:42:52,050
- Is it?
- Jim.

521
00:42:52,199 --> 00:42:54,009
I... I know. I guess. You're right.

522
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:02,329
Back on Earth, when something breaks,
you don't fix it, you replace it.

523
00:43:03,199 --> 00:43:05,931
The colonies, they have problems to solve.

524
00:43:06,159 --> 00:43:07,844
They're my kind of problems.

525
00:43:09,559 --> 00:43:11,641
And a mechanic is somebody.

526
00:43:11,719 --> 00:43:13,927
This is a new world still being built.

527
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:18,320
I could build a house and live in it.

528
00:43:23,199 --> 00:43:25,851
Open country. Room to grow.

529
00:43:26,159 --> 00:43:27,400
Now you're back to slogans.

530
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:29,244
Can't slogans be true?

531
00:43:31,159 --> 00:43:32,536
<i>Do you know how much
Homestead Company</i>

532
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:34,641
made off its first planet?

533
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:36,802
Eight quadrillion dollars.

534
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:39,610
That's eight million billions.

535
00:43:39,719 --> 00:43:42,086
Colony planets
are the biggest business going.

536
00:43:42,519 --> 00:43:44,204
Did you pay full price for your ticket?

537
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:46,646
No. I'm in a desirable trade.

538
00:43:46,719 --> 00:43:51,282
So they fill your head with dreams,
discount your ticket,

539
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:53,248
and you fly off to populate their planet

540
00:43:53,320 --> 00:43:55,447
and give Homestead
20% of everything that you make

541
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:56,559
for the rest of your life.

542
00:43:56,599 --> 00:43:59,728
Not to mention the debt you run up
on this fancy starship.

543
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:01,882
So all you see here is 5,000 suckers?

544
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,402
I see zeros
on the Homestead Company's bottom line.

545
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,769
I see 5,000 men and women
changing their lives.

546
00:44:10,679 --> 00:44:13,364
For 5,000 different reasons.
You don't know these people.

547
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,130
I'm a journalist. I know people.

548
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:18,800
Really?

549
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:20,561
This one.

550
00:44:21,039 --> 00:44:23,519
Is he a banker, a teacher or a gardener?

551
00:44:25,159 --> 00:44:26,923
- Banker.
- He's a gardener.

552
00:44:28,599 --> 00:44:31,126
And her. Is she a...

553
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:33,971
Madison, Donna or a Lola?

554
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:37,362
Donna's too serious for that hair.

555
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:38,440
Lola.

556
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,327
- Madison.
- Shit!

557
00:44:43,679 --> 00:44:46,523
All right, chef, accountant or midwife?

558
00:44:46,760 --> 00:44:47,806
She has to be a midwife.

559
00:44:47,880 --> 00:44:49,496
There's no way you just made that one up.

560
00:44:49,519 --> 00:44:50,567
Yeah. She's a midwife.

561
00:44:52,280 --> 00:44:54,442
I didn't know they still had midwives.

562
00:44:56,559 --> 00:44:59,085
I like her. We'd be friends.

563
00:44:59,639 --> 00:45:01,403
You think you can see that?

564
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,891
Don't you?

565
00:45:05,079 --> 00:45:06,240
I do.

566
00:45:06,440 --> 00:45:08,885
- A round-trip ticket?
- That's right.

567
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:11,360
I was gonna fly to Homestead II,
live for a year,

568
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,771
and then right back to Earth.

569
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:16,487
I don't get it. I left Earth for a new life,
but you end up back where you started?

570
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:18,210
I end up in the future.

571
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,487
Two hundred and fifty years in the future,

572
00:45:20,559 --> 00:45:23,324
on Earth, which is still
the center of civilization,

573
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:24,639
like it or not.

574
00:45:25,559 --> 00:45:28,961
And I'll be the only writer to ever travel
to a colony world and come back.

575
00:45:29,079 --> 00:45:30,969
I'll have a story no one else can tell.

576
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:32,570
What story?

577
00:45:32,639 --> 00:45:34,960
Humanity's flight to the stars.

578
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:37,007
The greatest migration in human history.

579
00:45:37,079 --> 00:45:38,730
It's the biggest story there is.

580
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:41,056
But you won't know
any of the people who are reading it.

581
00:45:41,079 --> 00:45:42,570
But they'd be reading it.

582
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,324
Or they would have been.

583
00:45:48,039 --> 00:45:49,326
I'll never write it now.

584
00:45:49,840 --> 00:45:51,489
I don't know if I'll ever write again.

585
00:45:54,159 --> 00:45:56,969
Jim, I can't think of anything else to try

586
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,449
to save us.

587
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:03,840
And I don't even want to
think about it anymore.

588
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:07,684
What is there to do around here?

589
00:46:10,719 --> 00:46:12,927
- Are you serious?
- Dead serious.

590
00:46:13,039 --> 00:46:15,963
- Partner mode.
<i>- Let's get it on!</i>

591
00:46:16,039 --> 00:46:18,485
Come on, get in power mode.

592
00:46:25,159 --> 00:46:26,730
You just stand here.

593
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:28,210
And then we repeat what they do.

594
00:46:36,239 --> 00:46:38,527
Uh, is there anything else we can do?

595
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:39,806
- Just do the...
- Okay.

596
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,255
- You don't have to.
- Okay. I can...

597
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,123
<i>- Beat down!</i>
- Hey!

598
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:45,445
Here we go. Let's see it. Oh!

599
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:47,449
Whoa! Whoa! Oh.

600
00:46:47,519 --> 00:46:48,896
Oh!

601
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:50,842
- Why you smiling?
<i>- Aurora! Aurora!</i>

602
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:52,570
'Cause I'm up two points.

603
00:46:53,079 --> 00:46:54,320
Who's the lovely lady?

604
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,646
This is Aurora.

605
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:58,121
Aurora. A pleasure.

606
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,364
- I can't!
- You did great!

607
00:47:02,719 --> 00:47:04,639
Okay, one more time.
One more time, let's see it.

608
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,885
Oh!

609
00:47:16,719 --> 00:47:17,721
- Yes!
- Whoo!

610
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:22,920
I swear, I didn't
wear pants for a month.

611
00:47:23,079 --> 00:47:25,606
Seven weeks and two days, to be exact.

612
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:26,920
The man has no shame.

613
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:29,480
Well, you're a little lacking
in that area yourself, Arthur.

614
00:47:32,960 --> 00:47:34,485
I laughed at the man with no pants

615
00:47:34,559 --> 00:47:36,688
until I realized I have no legs.

616
00:47:43,199 --> 00:47:45,601
For a minute,
I almost forgot my life is in ruins.

617
00:47:46,039 --> 00:47:47,246
I'm sorry.

618
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,405
What for?

619
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,289
I'm gonna go to bed.

620
00:47:53,119 --> 00:47:54,121
Good night.

621
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:55,804
- All right.
- Good night, Aurora.

622
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:00,925
She is wonderful.

623
00:48:02,599 --> 00:48:04,125
Excellent choice.

624
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:32,601
Hello.

625
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,400
<i>Hi.</i>

626
00:49:35,039 --> 00:49:36,041
Here you go.

627
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:44,248
<i>Is he asking me on a date?</i>

628
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,206
Do you need a pen?

629
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:02,603
She didn't seem that impressed.

630
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:22,887
"Love to." She wrote, "Love to."

631
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,530
<i>You have a visitor.</i>

632
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:52,405
Wow.

633
00:50:52,679 --> 00:50:54,603
You clean up pretty good yourself.

634
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:56,367
You went shopping.

635
00:50:56,480 --> 00:50:58,800
I went shoplifting.

636
00:51:03,199 --> 00:51:04,246
Evening.

637
00:51:04,519 --> 00:51:05,806
What can I get for you?

638
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:07,882
I'll have a Manhattan, please.

639
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:11,168
- Whiskey, rocks.
- Coming up.

640
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:21,050
You two look fine this evening.

641
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:23,925
Thank you, Arthur. We're on a date.

642
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:25,811
Very nice.

643
00:51:26,599 --> 00:51:28,364
Took you long enough to ask.

644
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:30,170
I was giving you space.

645
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:33,159
Space.

646
00:51:33,239 --> 00:51:35,561
The one thing I do not need more of.

647
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,364
That was so good.

648
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:44,960
It wasn't easy getting a reservation.

649
00:51:45,440 --> 00:51:47,760
They're probably gonna want us
to give up our table.

650
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:49,175
- Mmm-hmm.
- I'm getting a lot of dirty looks.

651
00:51:49,199 --> 00:51:51,079
Very popular tonight.

652
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,244
So how's your book coming?

653
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,447
I don't really know what it is yet.

654
00:51:57,599 --> 00:51:59,601
My dad, he used to always
write about his life,

655
00:51:59,719 --> 00:52:01,289
but he had stories.

656
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:04,204
He'd sailed around Antarctica.

657
00:52:05,199 --> 00:52:06,440
He was a war reporter.

658
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:08,766
He had lovers.

659
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:10,519
He wrote about his daughter.

660
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:12,320
He wrote about you?

661
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:14,965
Yeah. I grew up reading
about myself in his books.

662
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:16,041
How was that?

663
00:52:17,559 --> 00:52:18,606
Not always easy.

664
00:52:18,920 --> 00:52:21,400
A little more than you wanted
to know about yourself.

665
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:24,650
And then, when I was 17,

666
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:26,969
he had a heart attack.

667
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:29,925
Right at his keypad.

668
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:32,329
End of story.

669
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,846
That was so serious. I'm sorry.

670
00:52:38,599 --> 00:52:39,806
We need more wine.

671
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,405
I like hearing about your life.

672
00:52:42,920 --> 00:52:44,409
Thanks.

673
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,170
Why are we here?

674
00:52:48,239 --> 00:52:49,365
You'll see.

675
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:53,050
Best show in town.

676
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,929
So you've done this before?

677
00:52:59,039 --> 00:53:00,280
Oh, yeah.

678
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:01,760
And it's safe?

679
00:53:02,039 --> 00:53:04,007
No.

680
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:05,846
Reasonably safe.

681
00:53:07,519 --> 00:53:09,681
Hop in. You're next.

682
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:12,280
What about my dress?

683
00:53:15,559 --> 00:53:16,561
Right.

684
00:53:19,639 --> 00:53:21,164
Turn around.

685
00:53:52,039 --> 00:53:53,451
<i>Tether attached.</i>

686
00:54:34,440 --> 00:54:36,043
<i>What are you doing?</i>

687
00:54:36,119 --> 00:54:37,201
<i>Do you trust me?</i>

688
00:55:24,719 --> 00:55:26,244
<i>Thank you.</i>

689
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,487
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

690
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:23,168
You kill me.

691
00:57:05,519 --> 00:57:07,521
You okay?

692
00:57:07,599 --> 00:57:09,010
Yeah.

693
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:12,449
I'm fine.

694
00:57:12,519 --> 00:57:14,010
It's just...

695
00:57:21,559 --> 00:57:23,164
Yeah, I know.

696
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,565
<i>So, I'm seeing someone.</i>

697
00:57:41,639 --> 00:57:43,289
<i>You'll never guess who.</i>

698
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:47,963
<i>We're the last two people in the world
who would ever get together.</i>

699
00:57:48,719 --> 00:57:50,324
<i>But here we are.</i>

700
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:51,811
<i>The last two people in the world.</i>

701
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:53,320
What's that?

702
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:54,844
I'm writing, Arthur. Hush.

703
00:57:56,199 --> 00:57:59,204
<i>Jim and I live
in accidental happiness.</i>

704
00:57:59,280 --> 00:58:02,250
<i>Like castaways,
making their home on strange shores.</i>

705
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,481
"Strange shores." I love it.

706
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:05,856
You do? You don't have to say that.

707
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,007
- I know.
- You're not gonna eat this.

708
00:58:10,519 --> 00:58:11,851
Does that seem fishy to you?

709
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:14,967
Keep reading.

710
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,244
<i>It's funny.</i>

711
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:18,923
<i>We all have dreams.</i>

712
00:58:20,039 --> 00:58:23,123
<i>We plan our futures
like we're the captains of our fates.</i>

713
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,570
<i>But we're passengers.</i>

714
00:58:25,639 --> 00:58:27,608
<i>We go where fate takes us.</i>

715
00:58:27,719 --> 00:58:30,041
<i>I can't</i>

716
00:58:30,199 --> 00:58:31,199
<i>Help</i>

717
00:58:31,239 --> 00:58:32,240
Arthur!

718
00:58:32,360 --> 00:58:33,920
<i>This isn't the life we planned.</i>

719
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:36,010
<i>But it's ours.</i>

720
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:38,650
<i>And for the first time in my life,</i>

721
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:40,403
<i>I don't feel alone.</i>

722
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:45,362
<i>We weren't supposed to find each other.</i>

723
00:58:46,960 --> 00:58:48,405
<i>But we did.</i>

724
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:52,170
<i>He makes me feel like my life isn't over.</i>

725
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,447
<i>Like it's just beginning.</i>

726
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,360
How was your day?

727
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,442
Good. I wrote a few pages.

728
00:58:58,840 --> 00:59:00,762
Did you find anything that can help us?

729
00:59:04,599 --> 00:59:06,204
- I did.
- Are they real?

730
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,610
I cut them myself.

731
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:10,010
Oh, wow!

732
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:13,599
You know, for two unlucky people,

733
00:59:13,639 --> 00:59:15,050
we sure got pretty lucky.

734
00:59:20,599 --> 00:59:22,045
<i>Attention.</i>

735
00:59:22,159 --> 00:59:25,800
<i>You may wish to proceed to a viewing area.</i>

736
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:29,248
<i>The Avalon will slingshot
around the star Arcturus.</i>

737
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:30,764
Look!

738
00:59:30,840 --> 00:59:32,682
Oh, my God!

739
01:00:08,159 --> 01:00:09,844
That was amazing.

740
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:13,364
A red giant.

741
01:00:18,039 --> 01:00:20,007
The universe's present to you.

742
01:00:20,519 --> 01:00:21,851
What?

743
01:00:23,079 --> 01:00:24,969
Happy birthday.

744
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:36,329
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

745
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:40,324
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

746
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,449
<i>Happy birthday, dear Aurora</i>

747
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:48,885
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

748
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,880
A birthday drink
for the birthday girl.

749
01:00:53,000 --> 01:00:54,215
Aren't you going to ask for my ID?

750
01:00:54,239 --> 01:00:55,416
I might not be old enough to drink.

751
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:57,920
Oh, I would never ask your age
in front of a gentleman.

752
01:00:58,360 --> 01:00:59,849
Jim's no gentleman.

753
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,400
Anyway, there's no secrets
between me and Jim.

754
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:06,324
- Is that so?
- You heard the lady.

755
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:07,447
I will be right back.

756
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,411
This is a perfect birthday drink.
Thank you.

757
01:01:25,480 --> 01:01:28,608
I remember this day a year ago.

758
01:01:28,679 --> 01:01:30,728
Jim was so looking forward to meeting you.

759
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:32,920
What?

760
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,648
How could he be looking forward to it?

761
01:01:35,719 --> 01:01:38,405
Oh, he spent months deciding
whether to wake you up.

762
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:41,806
He couldn't stop talking about you.

763
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:47,690
Jim woke me up?

764
01:01:48,519 --> 01:01:49,851
Oh, yes.

765
01:01:50,639 --> 01:01:53,483
He said it was the hardest
decision of his life.

766
01:01:53,599 --> 01:01:56,126
But I see it worked out just fine.

767
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:09,771
What?

768
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:14,322
Did you wake me up?

769
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:23,121
Yes, I woke you up.

770
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,126
How...

771
01:02:29,840 --> 01:02:31,045
How could you do it?

772
01:02:34,320 --> 01:02:35,684
I tried not to.

773
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:43,804
I'm gonna be sick.

774
01:02:45,000 --> 01:02:46,525
I can't see.

775
01:02:48,559 --> 01:02:49,686
Aurora, please...

776
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:52,239
Stay away from me!

777
01:02:55,840 --> 01:02:57,443
I can't get off this ship.

778
01:02:57,519 --> 01:03:00,000
I can't get off this ship. I can't get off.

779
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:12,800
No!

780
01:03:27,239 --> 01:03:28,286
Oh, God.

781
01:04:15,920 --> 01:04:17,489
Can I talk to you?

782
01:05:46,039 --> 01:05:47,804
<i>Aurora,</i>

783
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,163
<i>I know nothing I can say
will make this okay.</i>

784
01:05:51,639 --> 01:05:52,971
<i>But please listen.</i>

785
01:05:53,559 --> 01:05:55,880
I was so alone

786
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:57,530
for so long.

787
01:05:59,039 --> 01:06:00,320
It felt like I was disappearing.

788
01:06:02,119 --> 01:06:05,123
The night I first saw you,
I was ready to...

789
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:09,721
You saved my life.

790
01:06:12,960 --> 01:06:16,088
<i>And I know that's no excuse for what I did.</i>

791
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,043
I read everything you wrote,

792
01:06:19,639 --> 01:06:22,882
<i>and I fell in love with your voice</i>

793
01:06:23,199 --> 01:06:26,010
<i>and with the way your mind works.</i>

794
01:06:26,159 --> 01:06:28,561
<i>I fell in love with you.</i>

795
01:06:29,760 --> 01:06:31,728
<i>And all of a sudden,</i>

796
01:06:31,920 --> 01:06:34,889
it was like I... I wasn't trapped anymore.

797
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:39,163
My pointless life suddenly had meaning.

798
01:06:41,599 --> 01:06:43,681
And I wish I could take it back.

799
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:46,730
<i>But I can't.</i>

800
01:06:48,199 --> 01:06:49,724
<i>Aurora, I don't want to lose you.</i>

801
01:06:49,800 --> 01:06:51,927
I don't care!

802
01:06:52,159 --> 01:06:54,208
I don't care what you want!

803
01:06:54,519 --> 01:06:57,126
<i>I don't care why you woke me up!</i>

804
01:06:57,599 --> 01:07:00,284
You took my life!

805
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:24,884
<i>Please stand by.</i>

806
01:07:24,960 --> 01:07:27,929
<i>Your suite's control center is rebooting.</i>

807
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,043
I envy you, Arthur.

808
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:06,760
How so?

809
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,003
You have a purpose.

810
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:12,681
You're always happy.

811
01:08:14,000 --> 01:08:15,728
How's your book coming along?

812
01:08:16,399 --> 01:08:18,208
I've never written about myself before.

813
01:08:18,840 --> 01:08:20,775
I think it's some of the best work
I've ever done,

814
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:22,768
and I don't even know why I'm doing it.

815
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,844
There's only one person who could read it,
and I can't stand him.

816
01:08:27,199 --> 01:08:30,568
They say time heals all wounds.

817
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,006
Broken hearts aren't that simple, Arthur.

818
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,251
You wouldn't understand.

819
01:08:42,079 --> 01:08:43,569
Arthur!

820
01:08:48,039 --> 01:08:49,724
Tuesday's my day with Arthur.

821
01:08:50,079 --> 01:08:51,206
It's Wednesday.

822
01:08:59,399 --> 01:09:00,480
The bar's all yours.

823
01:09:09,800 --> 01:09:11,244
What'll you have? Whiskey?

824
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:14,404
Coffee.

825
01:09:14,680 --> 01:09:16,091
<i>Aurora! We love you!</i>

826
01:09:16,159 --> 01:09:18,279
<i>What are we gonna do without you?
We'll miss you so...</i>

827
01:09:21,079 --> 01:09:22,444
<i>You're the bravest woman I know.</i>

828
01:09:22,520 --> 01:09:23,930
<i>Bye, Aurora!</i>

829
01:09:24,279 --> 01:09:28,001
<i>I promise that I will
think of you every day.</i>

830
01:09:28,079 --> 01:09:30,207
<i>When you wake up, I'll be gone,</i>

831
01:09:30,279 --> 01:09:33,806
<i>but just know that I will never forget you.</i>

832
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,529
<i>You're my best friend.</i>

833
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:39,444
<i>You were never happy here. I know.</i>

834
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,648
<i>Nothing was ever enough for you.</i>

835
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:45,287
<i>You know, you don't have to go.</i>

836
01:09:45,439 --> 01:09:48,569
<i>You could do
whatever it is you have to do right here.</i>

837
01:09:50,279 --> 01:09:51,280
<i>But, uh...</i>

838
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:55,048
<i>Since you're going, here's my wish.</i>

839
01:09:57,319 --> 01:10:01,609
<i>I hope you finally find someone
who fills your heart, and</i>

840
01:10:02,279 --> 01:10:04,247
<i>I hope you let him in.</i>

841
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,685
<i>I hope you realize you don't have to do
something amazing to be happy.</i>

842
01:10:12,159 --> 01:10:14,765
<i>You know, have fun,</i>

843
01:10:15,640 --> 01:10:17,243
<i>take chances.</i>

844
01:10:19,079 --> 01:10:20,922
<i>Um, okay.</i>

845
01:10:22,359 --> 01:10:23,805
<i>I love you, Aurora.</i>

846
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:25,845
<i>Bye.</i>

847
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:30,603
Morning, Arthur!

848
01:10:30,680 --> 01:10:32,603
- Coffee, please.
- Coming up.

849
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,608
Are you soiling my barstool?

850
01:10:40,840 --> 01:10:43,127
You want to make things,
you got to get your hands dirty.

851
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,199
And what have you been making?

852
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,051
Improvements.

853
01:10:48,039 --> 01:10:50,042
<i>Grand concourse.</i>

854
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:18,485
<i>First floor.</i>

855
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,488
<i>Gold-class breakfast.</i>

856
01:11:49,800 --> 01:11:52,644
<i>This is Deck Chief Gus Mancuso.</i>

857
01:11:53,279 --> 01:11:56,283
<i>Who the hell planted a tree on my ship?</i>

858
01:12:17,800 --> 01:12:19,643
- Who did that?
- I did.

859
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:21,240
Who are you?

860
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:22,600
Jim Preston.

861
01:12:24,239 --> 01:12:25,240
Aurora Lane.

862
01:12:26,079 --> 01:12:27,365
Anybody else awake?

863
01:12:27,439 --> 01:12:28,965
Just me and him.

864
01:12:29,640 --> 01:12:31,130
How far along are we?

865
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,159
Eighty-eight years to go.

866
01:12:41,840 --> 01:12:43,762
Hibernation failure.

867
01:12:44,960 --> 01:12:46,689
They said that couldn't happen.

868
01:12:46,760 --> 01:12:50,002
Three people, three pod failures.

869
01:12:55,279 --> 01:12:57,965
You have no idea
how long I've been trying to get in there.

870
01:12:58,119 --> 01:13:00,360
Now that you're in, don't touch anything.

871
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:01,970
This is where you work?

872
01:13:02,039 --> 01:13:04,280
No, this is flight crew. I'm a deck chief.

873
01:13:04,479 --> 01:13:05,480
Hmm.

874
01:13:05,600 --> 01:13:07,728
Ops, Navigation, Comm.

875
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:09,720
Hmm.

876
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:12,929
<i>Unauthorized personnel.</i>

877
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:14,646
Sorry.

878
01:13:17,199 --> 01:13:20,363
If I'm reading this right,
we're still on course.

879
01:13:20,439 --> 01:13:23,171
So whatever's wrong with the ship,
NavCom is still on the job.

880
01:13:23,239 --> 01:13:24,735
There's something wrong with the ship?

881
01:13:24,760 --> 01:13:27,206
Three pod failures?
Yeah, there's something wrong.

882
01:13:27,279 --> 01:13:29,043
Question is what.

883
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,250
That's strange.

884
01:13:33,319 --> 01:13:35,960
We should be getting diagnostics
from all over the ship right here,

885
01:13:36,000 --> 01:13:37,842
but there's no data.

886
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,363
Got to check all the systems manually.

887
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:43,601
Can't we turn the ship around,
go back to Earth?

888
01:13:43,680 --> 01:13:45,055
No, we're doing 50% of light speed.

889
01:13:45,079 --> 01:13:47,400
Turning back would
take just as much time as going on.

890
01:13:47,479 --> 01:13:49,239
Well, there's got to be
something we can do.

891
01:13:49,319 --> 01:13:51,686
Sorry. We're going where we're going.

892
01:13:54,239 --> 01:13:55,240
You okay?

893
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,288
Hibernation hangover.

894
01:13:58,359 --> 01:14:00,010
Get it all the time.

895
01:14:00,359 --> 01:14:02,168
<i>Grand concourse.</i>

896
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:03,445
Two years, huh?

897
01:14:03,520 --> 01:14:05,443
Any more trees I need to know about?

898
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:06,520
Look out!

899
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,324
Never seen that before.

900
01:14:13,399 --> 01:14:15,288
These robots have been breaking down.

901
01:14:15,359 --> 01:14:18,011
This guy makes fifteen?

902
01:14:18,680 --> 01:14:19,726
Fifteen.

903
01:14:19,800 --> 01:14:21,244
The breakfast bar went crazy today.

904
01:14:21,319 --> 01:14:23,640
- Yeah, and an elevator.
- Last week, my door broke.

905
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,926
- I was trapped in my cabin for two days.
- You were?

906
01:14:27,399 --> 01:14:29,845
Things like that don't happen.
Not on this ship.

907
01:14:30,720 --> 01:14:32,768
There are 16 of these tech stations
on every deck.

908
01:14:33,760 --> 01:14:34,886
Dock your slate.

909
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:37,176
- Data syncs automatically. Got it?
- Hmm.

910
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:38,884
- Yeah.
- Okay.

911
01:14:39,039 --> 01:14:41,407
You take decks one and two.
You take decks three and four.

912
01:14:41,479 --> 01:14:45,404
I'm going down to the hibernation bay,
check our pods.

913
01:14:46,039 --> 01:14:47,564
Well, that should be interesting.

914
01:14:58,279 --> 01:15:00,000
Ain't you supposed to be
making your rounds?

915
01:15:01,199 --> 01:15:02,439
I'm finished.

916
01:15:05,159 --> 01:15:06,889
I checked your pod.

917
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:10,490
Problem's very simple.
The clock chip's burnt out.

918
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:13,324
It ain't supposed to happen,
but pretty simple.

919
01:15:13,399 --> 01:15:14,890
My pod's more complicated.

920
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:17,850
Bunch of system failures that
all happened at the same time.

921
01:15:17,920 --> 01:15:19,729
Whole damn thing went haywire.

922
01:15:22,119 --> 01:15:23,929
Explains why I'm feeling so bad.

923
01:15:24,319 --> 01:15:25,605
But Aurora's pod...

924
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,404
You did this.

925
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:34,841
Yeah.

926
01:15:34,920 --> 01:15:37,365
All this time, I'm thinking
you're one lucky son of a bitch

927
01:15:37,439 --> 01:15:39,090
to get stuck with Aurora.

928
01:15:42,479 --> 01:15:44,403
It wasn't luck, was it?

929
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:45,961
No.

930
01:15:46,039 --> 01:15:47,121
She knows?

931
01:15:47,840 --> 01:15:48,966
She knows.

932
01:15:51,159 --> 01:15:52,399
How long were you alone?

933
01:15:52,960 --> 01:15:54,324
A year.

934
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,324
Still...

935
01:16:01,159 --> 01:16:02,649
Damn.

936
01:16:08,439 --> 01:16:10,090
<i>Data received.</i>

937
01:16:14,039 --> 01:16:15,279

938
01:16:20,159 --> 01:16:22,207
<i>- Data received.</i>
- Same as Jim's.

01:16:22,279 --> 01:16:23,485
<i>Interpolating data.</i>

940
01:16:23,560 --> 01:16:25,608
System shutdowns...

941
01:16:25,680 --> 01:16:27,966
Everywhere, but no apparent connection.

942
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:31,284
You saw the hibernation pods?

943
01:16:32,319 --> 01:16:33,400
I saw them.

944
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:35,646
<i>Data received.</i>

945
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,006
So you know

946
01:16:38,359 --> 01:16:39,360
what Jim did.

947
01:16:42,359 --> 01:16:43,690
Yeah.

948
01:16:44,479 --> 01:16:45,480
And?

949
01:16:46,079 --> 01:16:48,400
- It's not my...
- He woke me up.

950
01:16:49,079 --> 01:16:50,444
He took away my life.

951
01:16:50,520 --> 01:16:52,601
I know, and I'm sorry,
but there's work I'd...

952
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,444
It's murder.

953
01:16:57,359 --> 01:16:58,930
You're right, Aurora.

954
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:02,606
But the drowning man will always try
and drag somebody down with him.

955
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:05,326
It ain't right, but the man's drowning.

956
01:17:07,359 --> 01:17:09,043
This one makes 16.

957
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:13,680
Yeah.

958
01:17:15,960 --> 01:17:17,689
Hey. You okay?

959
01:17:20,439 --> 01:17:22,920
- You should go rest.
- Yeah.

960
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:28,082
But just a couple hours, and then back
at it first thing in the morning.

961
01:20:15,239 --> 01:20:16,855
I was in the pool when
the gravity gave out.

962
01:20:16,880 --> 01:20:18,006
Are you okay?

963
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:19,729
We need to find Gus.

964
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,962
<i>Gus! Gus!</i>

965
01:20:23,960 --> 01:20:27,159
Gravity loss means that whatever's wrong
is starting to hit the big-ticket items.

966
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:28,439
Not good.

967
01:20:29,319 --> 01:20:31,003
Every failure's a burnt out processor.

968
01:20:31,079 --> 01:20:33,845
Everything on board's thinking too hard.

969
01:20:34,359 --> 01:20:35,600
Why?

970
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:39,085
Computer, display these failures over time.

971
01:20:39,159 --> 01:20:41,287
<i>Processing timeline.</i>

972
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,085
Cascade failure.

973
01:20:45,159 --> 01:20:47,605
It started two years ago. Power surge.

974
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,721
Seventeen failures in one day.

975
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:53,608
Including hibernation pod 1498.

976
01:20:53,720 --> 01:20:54,766
That's me.

977
01:20:55,439 --> 01:20:56,885
Woke me up.

978
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:01,091
- What happened that day?
- Something big.

979
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:03,328
A major system went down somewhere.

980
01:21:03,800 --> 01:21:06,087
Everything else on board
is trying to pick up the load,

981
01:21:06,159 --> 01:21:07,889
but the load's too heavy.

982
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:09,802
Whatever started this, we got to find it.

983
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:11,006
And fix it.

984
01:21:11,079 --> 01:21:12,411
How bad can this get?

985
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,006
Give me risk analysis based on this data.

986
01:21:16,079 --> 01:21:17,127

989
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:24,605

01:21:45,079 --> 01:21:47,730
With Diagnostics out,
we'll have to find it ourselves.

995
01:21:48,479 --> 01:21:50,323
Where do we start?

996
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:52,364

01:28:22,199 --> 01:28:23,359
I guess one got through.

1072
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:32,520
It's hot.

1073
01:28:40,039 --> 01:28:41,159
I think we found it.

1074
01:28:51,600 --> 01:28:54,079
It's the reactor-control computer.

1075
01:28:59,920 --> 01:29:01,569
This is what hit us two years ago.

1076
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:03,005
Jim...

1077
01:29:03,560 --> 01:29:04,890
How can we fix this?

1078
01:29:08,760 --> 01:29:09,761
We're gonna die.

1079
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:11,609
There's replacement pans for everything.

1080
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:18,443
- Light.
- Sorry.

1081
01:29:20,760 --> 01:29:23,411
Soon as I pull this module,
the entire computer's gonna shut down.

1082
01:29:23,479 --> 01:29:25,323
Well, what happens then?

1083
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:28,529
I'll get it back up as quickly as I can.

1084
01:29:33,279 --> 01:29:34,280
Hurry!

1085
01:29:37,000 --> 01:29:38,729
- Jim!
- Okay.

1086
01:29:41,039 --> 01:29:42,804
<i>Control computer restored.</i>

1087
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:45,966
<i>Venting reactor.</i>

1088
01:29:48,560 --> 01:29:51,006
- But we fixed it!
<i>- Reactor vent failed.</i>

1089
01:29:51,079 --> 01:29:53,447
<i>Manual override required.</i>

1090
01:29:59,239 --> 01:30:00,320
<i>Vent failure.</i>

1091
01:30:00,399 --> 01:30:02,003
- Come on!
- Jim.

1092
01:30:06,920 --> 01:30:08,649
<i>Outer door nonresponsive.</i>

1093
01:30:08,720 --> 01:30:10,484
What does that mean?

1094
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:14,048
The outer door is jammed.

1095
01:30:14,119 --> 01:30:16,095
We've got to open that door
and cool the reactor down,

1096
01:30:16,119 --> 01:30:17,484
or the whole ship is gonna blow.

1097
01:30:17,960 --> 01:30:20,327
- How?
- I got to go out there.

1098
01:30:20,399 --> 01:30:22,003
Open it from the outside.

1099
01:30:22,960 --> 01:30:24,529
I open the door, I get clear.

1100
01:30:25,640 --> 01:30:28,609
- You blow that fire into space.
- You get clear?

1101
01:30:28,680 --> 01:30:30,250
You can talk to me through this.

1102
01:30:30,359 --> 01:30:32,362
What happens to you when that door opens?

1103
01:30:42,840 --> 01:30:44,364
Heat shield. It might help.

1104
01:30:53,680 --> 01:30:55,250
You might need this.

1105
01:31:08,920 --> 01:31:09,921
It's gonna be okay.

1106
01:31:20,239 --> 01:31:21,320
I better go.

1107
01:31:26,640 --> 01:31:29,086
Jim. Jim.

1108
01:31:32,399 --> 01:31:33,925
Come back to me.

1109
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,728
I can't live on the ship without you.

1110
01:32:03,199 --> 01:32:04,201
<i>Warning.</i>

1111
01:32:04,279 --> 01:32:06,088
<i>- Temperature critical.</i>
- Ow!

1112
01:32:19,279 --> 01:32:20,805
<i>What's wrong?</i>

1113
01:32:21,279 --> 01:32:22,360
<i>What's the matter?</i>

1114
01:32:22,439 --> 01:32:23,930
<i>- Are you okay?</i>
- Nothing.

1115
01:32:24,000 --> 01:32:25,809
- Go.
<i>- You sure?</i>

1116
01:32:25,920 --> 01:32:27,206
<i>Go.</i>

1117
01:32:34,920 --> 01:32:36,001
<i>I'm at the vent tube.</i>

1118
01:32:37,720 --> 01:32:39,768
<i>New anchor point. Reset tether.</i>

1119
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:44,881
<i>I see the door.</i>

1120
01:32:46,199 --> 01:32:48,088
<i>Temperature level rising.</i>

1121
01:32:55,279 --> 01:32:57,282
<i>Warning. Temperature critical.</i>

1122
01:33:04,159 --> 01:33:05,764
<i>Containment unstable.</i>

1123
01:33:07,640 --> 01:33:09,846
- Where are you?
<i>- I'm at the door.</i>

1124
01:33:09,920 --> 01:33:11,409
<i>I'm ready. Just say when.</i>

1125
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:12,520
<i>Here goes.</i>

1126
01:33:16,199 --> 01:33:17,360
<i>The door won't open.</i>

1127
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:19,170
<i>I'll have to bypass it.</i>

1128
01:33:21,479 --> 01:33:23,368
<i>Temperature level rising.</i>

1129
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:25,605
<i>Jim, come on!</i>

1130
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:27,210
<i>Please hurry!</i>

1131
01:33:27,560 --> 01:33:30,159
<i>- Okay, I'm trying it again.
- Tell me when you're clear.</i>

1132
01:33:34,680 --> 01:33:36,363
<i>- No!</i>
- What?

1133
01:33:37,159 --> 01:33:38,207
What's going on?

1134
01:33:39,279 --> 01:33:40,520
<i>Jim?</i>

1135
01:33:44,520 --> 01:33:45,567
<i>Jim!</i>

1136
01:33:45,920 --> 01:33:47,206
<i>The door won't stay open.</i>

1137
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:50,360
<i>I think I have to stay here.</i>

1138
01:33:50,920 --> 01:33:52,251
<i>Hold the door open.</i>

1139
01:33:52,560 --> 01:33:53,560
What?

1140
01:33:53,640 --> 01:33:54,720
No!

1141
01:33:55,039 --> 01:33:56,529
<i>No way! Get out of there!</i>

1142
01:33:56,600 --> 01:33:58,125
<i>I can't.</i>

1143
01:33:58,199 --> 01:33:59,564
<i>Jim.</i>

1144
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:00,921
<i>We're out of time.</i>

1145
01:34:02,800 --> 01:34:05,246
<i>- Containment unstable.</i>
- Jim?

1146
01:34:12,079 --> 01:34:13,127
<i>Vent the reactor.</i>

1147
01:34:20,039 --> 01:34:22,407
<i>No! You don't understand!</i>

1148
01:34:23,239 --> 01:34:25,890
<i>If I open the door right now,
it'll kill you!</i>

1149
01:34:25,960 --> 01:34:26,961
<i>I'm hoping not.</i>

1150
01:34:27,079 --> 01:34:28,922
Come back in.
We'll think of something else.

1151
01:34:29,000 --> 01:34:30,411
<i>There is nothing else.</i>

1152
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:32,886
<i>Jim!</i>

1153
01:34:34,079 --> 01:34:35,081
<i>- It's okay.
- No!</i>

1154
01:34:35,159 --> 01:34:37,002
- It's not okay!
<i>- Aurora...</i>

1155
01:34:37,079 --> 01:34:38,889
<i>Warning.
Temperature level exceeded.</i>

1156
01:34:39,079 --> 01:34:40,969
This isn't what you said was gonna happen!

1157
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:44,005
<i>Aurora, this ship is gonna go.</i>

1158
01:34:44,079 --> 01:34:46,082
I don't care! You die, I die.

1159
01:34:47,199 --> 01:34:49,770
<i>There are 5,000 other people
on this ship, Aurora.</i>

1160
01:34:51,319 --> 01:34:52,400
<i>We have to do this.</i>

1161
01:34:54,000 --> 01:34:55,444
<i>Maximum pressure reached.</i>

1162
01:34:59,000 --> 01:35:01,127
<i>Do it. Now.</i>

1163
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,881
<i>Maximum cabin pressure reached.</i>

1164
01:35:26,439 --> 01:35:27,885
<i>Temperature dropping.</i>

1165
01:35:29,479 --> 01:35:30,480
Jim.

1166
01:35:49,319 --> 01:35:51,287
- Jim?
<i>- Vent successful.</i>

1167
01:35:51,359 --> 01:35:53,886
<i>Rebooting process initiated.</i>

1168
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:55,319
Jim, please say something.

1169
01:36:32,680 --> 01:36:34,283
<i>Suit pressure dropping.</i>

1170
01:36:37,680 --> 01:36:40,206
<i>Return to ship immediately.</i>

1171
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:42,286
<i>Aurora?</i>

1172
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:45,961
It worked!

1173
01:36:46,039 --> 01:36:47,404
You did it! You can come in!

1174
01:36:47,680 --> 01:36:50,251
<i>Uh, yeah, about that.</i>

1175
01:36:50,319 --> 01:36:52,448
What's the matter? Are you hurt?

1176
01:36:52,520 --> 01:36:54,248
<i>I got blown out of the tube.</i>

1177
01:36:54,319 --> 01:36:55,970
- What?
<i>- My tether broke.</i>

1178
01:36:56,079 --> 01:36:58,242
<i>I can't get back to the ship.</i>

1179
01:36:58,840 --> 01:37:00,762
I'll come out. I'll come out.
I'll pull you in.

1180
01:37:00,880 --> 01:37:03,530
<i>Warning. Oxygen level critical.</i>

1181
01:37:03,720 --> 01:37:05,847
<i>Return to ship immediately.</i>

1182
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:17,046
<i>Aurora, I'm sorry.</i>

1183
01:37:19,079 --> 01:37:20,081
<i>For everything.</i>

1184
01:37:20,239 --> 01:37:22,447
Shut up. I'm coming.

1185
01:37:22,600 --> 01:37:26,604
<i>I wish we'd have met in 90 years.</i>

1186
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:34,963
<i>I'd... I'd have built you a house.</i>

1187
01:37:39,760 --> 01:37:41,761
<i>I'd have read your book.</i>

1188
01:37:44,279 --> 01:37:45,565
<i>It's gonna be great.</i>

1189
01:37:58,199 --> 01:37:59,201
<i>Tether attached.</i>

1190
01:37:59,640 --> 01:38:01,323
<i>Locate Jim Preston.</i>

1191
01:38:06,000 --> 01:38:08,479
<i>Jim Preston located.</i>

1192
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:10,970
<i>I'm coming to get you.</i>

1193
01:38:36,119 --> 01:38:37,484
<i>Jim!</i>

1194
01:39:37,399 --> 01:39:39,288
<i>I'm sorry. The patient is dead.</i>

1195
01:39:39,720 --> 01:39:41,529
Well, resuscitate him!

<i>Postmortem operations require

Hi!

01:41:23,279 --> 01:41:24,280
Jim!

1212
01:41:27,119 --> 01:41:28,405
Hey, Jim.

1213
01:41:56,399 --> 01:41:58,368
You brought me back.

1214
01:41:58,800 --> 01:42:00,131
Yeah.

1215
01:42:24,359 --> 01:42:26,328
- Thank you.
- Be still.

1216
01:42:26,720 --> 01:42:27,926
Of course.

1217
01:43:13,399 --> 01:43:15,163
There's something I have to show you.

1218
01:43:15,439 --> 01:43:16,735
In command mode, it turns out

1219
01:43:16,760 --> 01:43:21,003
the Autodoc has an option
called Stabilize and Suspend.

1220
01:43:21,439 --> 01:43:23,646
It stops all metabolic activity.

1221
01:43:25,520 --> 01:43:26,520
What are you saying?

1222
01:43:26,960 --> 01:43:30,407
With Gus's ID, it can be like hibernation
inside the Autodoc.

1223
01:43:30,479 --> 01:43:31,480
You can go back to sleep.

1224
01:43:36,640 --> 01:43:38,483
But there's only one Autodoc.

1225
01:43:42,960 --> 01:43:44,324
Yeah.

1226
01:43:46,479 --> 01:43:50,404
And you're gonna lay down in it
and fall asleep.

1227
01:43:51,520 --> 01:43:53,761
And you'll wake up on Homestead II.

1228
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:55,649
And you'll write your book.

1229
01:43:57,319 --> 01:43:58,400
You'd finish your journey.

1230
01:43:58,479 --> 01:44:00,368
You'd do what you set out to do.

1231
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,684
You'd be alone.

1232
01:44:12,000 --> 01:44:13,729
I've been alone before.

1233
01:44:14,239 --> 01:44:15,479
And I'll be fine.

1234
01:44:17,239 --> 01:44:19,003
But I would never see you again.

1235
01:44:22,840 --> 01:44:24,364
I'll come and visit you.

1236
01:45:07,399 --> 01:45:09,050
Tuesday is my day with Arthur.

1237
01:45:11,199 --> 01:45:12,725
Lovely as ever.

1238
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:15,041
Thank you, Arthur.
You're looking very well yourself.

1239
01:45:15,199 --> 01:45:16,564
Thanks to you.

1240
01:45:17,560 --> 01:45:18,560
What's that?

1241
01:45:21,600 --> 01:45:23,601
Something I've wanted to give you
for a long time.

1242
01:45:30,960 --> 01:45:32,564
It's beautiful.

1243
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:47,761
Took you long enough to ask.

1244
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:52,284
Champagne.

1245
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:53,886
I'll wait.

1246
01:46:11,159 --> 01:46:12,969
Hell of a life.

1247
01:46:15,439 --> 01:46:16,965
Hell of a life.

1248
01:46:48,239 --> 01:46:51,846
<i>Crew wake-up process initiated.</i>

1249
01:46:52,439 --> 01:46:54,328
<i>My fellow passengers,</i>

1250
01:46:54,399 --> 01:46:55,845
<i>if you're reading this,</i>

1251
01:46:55,920 --> 01:46:59,685
<i>then the Starship Avalon
has reached its destination.</i>

1252
01:46:59,760 --> 01:47:02,046
<i>Grand concourse.</i>

1253
01:47:02,119 --> 01:47:03,962
<i>A lot happened while you slept.</i>

1254
01:47:11,640 --> 01:47:13,529
<i>A friend once said,</i>

1255
01:47:13,600 --> 01:47:16,682
<i>"You can't get so hung up
on where you'd rather be</i>

1256
01:47:16,760 --> 01:47:19,842
<i>"that you forget to make
the most of where you are."</i>

1257
01:47:20,840 --> 01:47:22,887
<i>We got lost along the way.</i>

1258
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:25,564
<i>But we found each other.</i>

1259
01:47:26,359 --> 01:47:28,088
<i>And we made a life.</i>

1260
01:47:28,159 --> 01:47:30,287
<i>A beautiful life.</i>

1261
01:47:30,680 --> 01:47:32,363
<i>Together.</i>

1262
01:47:35,880 --> 01:47:41,921
<i>There's so much on my mind
I don't know where to start</i>

1263
01:47:42,000 --> 01:47:47,404
<i>There's that light in your eye
Filling up the dark</i>

1264
01:47:50,479 --> 01:47:53,881
<i>Just levitate, just levitate</i>

1265
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:59,724
<i>Just levitate, just levitate</i>

1266
01:48:00,239 --> 01:48:05,882
<i>I know that we're far
From where we need to be</i>

1267
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:11,006
<i>But the world wasn't made in just one day</i>

1268
01:48:12,199 --> 01:48:17,922
<i>Though our journey's long
I know our love is strong</i>

1269
01:48:18,000 --> 01:48:23,722
<i>You're my shooting star
We're flying higher, babe</i>

1270
01:48:26,840 --> 01:48:29,844
<i>Just levitate, just levitate</i>

1271
01:48:32,760 --> 01:48:35,604
<i>Just levitate, just levitate</i>

1272
01:48:38,920 --> 01:48:41,445
<i>Just levitate, just levitate</i>

1273
01:48:44,840 --> 01:48:48,207
<i>Just levitate, just levitate</i>

1274
01:48:48,279 --> 01:48:54,048
<i>When I'm stuck in the
middle of hell and faith</i>

1275
01:48:54,119 --> 01:48:59,001
<i>And I don't know where to turn</i>

1276
01:48:59,800 --> 01:49:04,805
<i>To bend my mind as the silver gate</i>

1277
01:49:05,800 --> 01:49:10,840
<i>You lead me on my way</i>

1278
01:49:14,920 --> 01:49:17,810
<i>Just levitate, just levitate</i>

1279
01:49:20,960 --> 01:49:23,042
<i>Just levitate, just levitate</i>

1280
01:49:27,159 --> 01:49:30,163
<i>Just levitate, just levitate</i>
