1
00:00:45,418 --> 00:00:47,221
This road you're on,

2
00:00:47,988 --> 00:00:51,098
you put yourself on this road,

3
00:00:52,558 --> 00:00:55,705
on this exact night.

4
00:00:55,895 --> 00:00:57,800
You chose this.

5
00:00:58,531 --> 00:01:01,210
A man makes his destiny, right?

6
00:01:01,835 --> 00:01:04,616
Nothing makes the gods laugh harder.

7
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:34,567
Treacherous roads out there tonight, folks.

8
00:01:34,568 --> 00:01:37,804
We could be looking at 10 inches of
the white stuff by morning.

9
00:01:37,805 --> 00:01:41,541
Temperatures here in the high desert
beginning to drop into the low 20s.

10
00:01:41,542 --> 00:01:45,416
So take my advice, all you desert rats.
Grab a bottle...

11
00:02:36,432 --> 00:02:37,769
Hey!

12
00:02:41,404 --> 00:02:43,684
No, I hit the ditch going 60.

13
00:02:45,408 --> 00:02:49,521
Ed? Ed, you there? Shit.

14
00:02:52,348 --> 00:02:55,323
Ed? Come on, sweetheart.

15
00:02:56,219 --> 00:03:00,764
You know, 50,000 miles, past two years,
without so much as a flat. You there?

16
00:03:01,057 --> 00:03:03,792
Yeah, I keep cutting out.
Listen. I'm gonna be another couple hours.

17
00:03:03,793 --> 00:03:06,563
I'll need you to drop in on Moreland for me,
keep the coals glowing.

18
00:03:06,564 --> 00:03:09,600
He's talking about redoing
the whole mall in Knob Hill.

19
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:10,901
Christmas time.

20
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:13,613
Yeah, 5:30.

21
00:03:19,076 --> 00:03:24,053
Oh, Ed, come on. I wouldn't be out here
in low rider central except to cover your ass.

22
00:03:24,148 --> 00:03:26,395
Thank you. I love you too.

23
00:03:28,853 --> 00:03:31,722
Listen.
Enrique, I've been on the road since 7:00.

24
00:03:31,723 --> 00:03:34,657
I'm a salesman. I got a wife at home,
we got a baby due this week.

25
00:03:34,658 --> 00:03:37,940
My wife gets really fucking nervous
when I'm held up.

26
00:03:39,997 --> 00:03:43,007
Like I said, this evening at best.

27
00:03:44,636 --> 00:03:46,108
Shit.

28
00:03:51,308 --> 00:03:53,988
Any interesting diversions around here?

29
00:03:54,847 --> 00:03:59,323
There's some cliffs about a mile walk.
Pretty sunsets.

30
00:04:06,793 --> 00:04:09,261
Hey, Pete, wasn't it?

31
00:04:09,262 --> 00:04:13,465
Listen. I got a contact in Phoenix
who's giving me a very sweet deal

32
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:16,033
on a fleet of retired jukes.

33
00:04:16,034 --> 00:04:20,444
Wurlitzer’s. The vintage 1015s.
Classic Americana.

34
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,072
Fully refurbished.

35
00:04:22,073 --> 00:04:23,376
Oh.

36
00:04:23,576 --> 00:04:25,577
And they've all still got
the original 45s in them.

37
00:04:25,578 --> 00:04:27,085
No shit.

38
00:04:27,647 --> 00:04:29,949
You stick one of those babies in here,

39
00:04:29,950 --> 00:04:32,058
you got the classiest joint
in a hundred miles.

40
00:04:32,151 --> 00:04:34,364
I've already got a jukebox.

41
00:04:38,191 --> 00:04:40,026
I'm talking about a Wurlitzer, Pete.

42
00:04:40,027 --> 00:04:44,742
A 1015. 1-0-1-5.
Most popular jukebox model of all time.

43
00:04:44,897 --> 00:04:47,543
People can't help but stuff them full of cash.

44
00:04:50,671 --> 00:04:52,543
Looking around here,

45
00:04:53,273 --> 00:04:56,609
I kind of get the impression you're a guy
who gives a shit about his place, yeah?

46
00:04:56,610 --> 00:04:59,845
You got new pool tables,
bathrooms are very clean,

47
00:04:59,846 --> 00:05:04,290
liquor's arranged just so.
A guy with his own sense of style.

48
00:05:05,053 --> 00:05:06,923
So think about it.

49
00:05:08,355 --> 00:05:13,935
Right there, a glowing tribute to
Presley, Otis Redding, Buddy Holly.

50
00:05:14,396 --> 00:05:16,369
Guaranteed money magnet.

51
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:18,968
Says here you sell flooring.

52
00:05:19,733 --> 00:05:23,812
Yeah. Right now I do, but in a few months,
I'm breaking out on my own.

53
00:05:24,004 --> 00:05:25,979
To bigger and better.

54
00:05:32,113 --> 00:05:35,019
No. What's with the reception around here?

55
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:54,740
Let me guess,
you've been expecting me, right?

56
00:05:56,071 --> 00:05:58,840
Just closing up. Slow day.

57
00:05:58,841 --> 00:06:01,646
No kidding. You mean it gets busy?

58
00:06:02,212 --> 00:06:04,424
You'd be surprised.

59
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,790
So, how much for a reading?

60
00:06:07,816 --> 00:06:09,357
Ten dollars.

61
00:06:10,185 --> 00:06:12,355
A bit steep, isn't it?

62
00:06:12,356 --> 00:06:14,726
I charge what you can afford.

63
00:06:15,190 --> 00:06:17,300
Yeah, okay. Why not?

64
00:06:24,035 --> 00:06:26,301
This doesn't involve killing any
chickens or anything, does it?

65
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,878
- Not unless you'd like it to.
- No.

66
00:06:35,046 --> 00:06:37,020
No crystal ball?

67
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,426
It's in the shop.

68
00:06:40,417 --> 00:06:42,254
Have a seat.

69
00:06:50,193 --> 00:06:55,431
Now, the energy is stronger if I touch
your hand, but it's up to you.

70
00:06:55,432 --> 00:06:58,545
Oh, hey, whatever, you know?
Just do your thing.

71
00:07:00,371 --> 00:07:05,052
- What would you like to know, Mister...
- Starks. Jimmy Starks.

72
00:07:05,443 --> 00:07:06,813
Oh, I don't know.

73
00:07:07,712 --> 00:07:10,153
My car. Gonna make it home?

74
00:07:18,155 --> 00:07:19,663
It will.

75
00:07:21,093 --> 00:07:22,560
Just from touching my hand.

76
00:07:22,561 --> 00:07:26,172
That's amazing.
What else are you picking up?

77
00:07:28,633 --> 00:07:30,276
Roads.

78
00:07:32,304 --> 00:07:34,347
Purple mountains.

79
00:07:34,874 --> 00:07:37,380
A woman is waiting for you there.

80
00:07:38,276 --> 00:07:40,277
She makes you feel 20 again.

81
00:07:40,278 --> 00:07:43,823
Yeah. Yeah. What's she wearing?

82
00:07:46,918 --> 00:07:48,755
A noisy mind,

83
00:07:51,189 --> 00:07:53,129
cluttered with fears.

84
00:07:54,393 --> 00:07:56,173
Strong ambition.

85
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:01,674
It's brought you trouble in the past.

86
00:08:04,203 --> 00:08:07,974
Hey, how about them Wolves?
You think I should take the spread?

87
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:10,708
I wouldn't bet against them.

88
00:08:10,709 --> 00:08:12,076
With Leavens on crutches?

89
00:08:12,077 --> 00:08:14,579
Come on, forget it.
The kid's their secret weapon.

90
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:17,183
- Leavens will play.
- With a blown knee?

91
00:08:17,184 --> 00:08:19,965
I doubt it very much. Nice try though.

92
00:08:20,254 --> 00:08:22,363
I wouldn't bet against them.

93
00:08:22,955 --> 00:08:28,172
Hey. I got a business venture
sort of hanging in limbo.

94
00:08:28,361 --> 00:08:30,302
How's that looking?

95
00:08:31,431 --> 00:08:35,042
That will require a deeper descent.

96
00:08:36,937 --> 00:08:39,309
Gotta put up the big antenna, huh?

97
00:08:41,242 --> 00:08:42,647
Okay.

98
00:08:53,321 --> 00:08:56,068
- Your venture is secure.
- Oh, yeah.

99
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:00,364
You will benefit from a windfall.

100
00:09:01,396 --> 00:09:06,043
A large sum of money coming to you
by way of Dallas.

101
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:11,040
Dallas? Well, I don't know anyone in Dallas,
but I'm happy to take it.

102
00:09:11,439 --> 00:09:13,686
All sunny skies ahead, huh?

103
00:09:13,808 --> 00:09:17,250
Chief? Hey!
Hey, you're breaking my hand here.

104
00:09:17,379 --> 00:09:18,681
Hey, hey!

105
00:09:19,414 --> 00:09:21,126
Hey.

106
00:09:21,616 --> 00:09:24,294
What the fuck? Are you okay?

107
00:09:28,123 --> 00:09:30,558
My concentration was broken.

108
00:09:30,559 --> 00:09:33,694
I thought you were
having a coronary or something.

109
00:09:33,696 --> 00:09:35,737
You sure you're all right?

110
00:09:39,636 --> 00:09:43,571
Well, you know.
Just catch your breath a minute.

111
00:09:43,572 --> 00:09:46,353
I'll get your stuff here.

112
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:50,424
I'm afraid the session is over, Mr. Starks.

113
00:09:50,647 --> 00:09:52,915
That was 15 bucks worth?

114
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:56,551
I don't control the gift. I only listen to it.

115
00:09:56,552 --> 00:10:00,234
Well, no offense,
but I've had better fortune cookies.

116
00:10:01,658 --> 00:10:04,496
Part of the show, right? Yeah? Yeah?

117
00:10:04,794 --> 00:10:06,929
That's good. You're good.

118
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:09,665
Like, another 20 bucks and maybe you
can summon the old vision back?

119
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:13,279
Come on, let's go again. This is great.

120
00:10:15,373 --> 00:10:17,740
We're finished, Mr. Starks.

121
00:10:17,741 --> 00:10:20,609
What?
So you're sore 'cause I spotted your game?

122
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:25,418
Come on. I'm a salesman, too, you know.
Maybe we can learn from each other.

123
00:10:25,483 --> 00:10:28,230
At least give me my money's worth.

124
00:10:31,721 --> 00:10:33,126
Okay.

125
00:10:37,863 --> 00:10:39,666
What?

126
00:10:48,307 --> 00:10:51,110
Strange way of doing business, pal.

127
00:10:53,377 --> 00:10:55,817
Diamond in the rough, chief.

128
00:10:56,247 --> 00:10:59,257
I'd work on your presentation a little.

129
00:11:05,590 --> 00:11:07,837
The Emergency Broadcasting System...

130
00:11:16,233 --> 00:11:18,879
...Estates.
Retirement for the new millennium.

131
00:11:22,608 --> 00:11:24,081
Shit!

132
00:11:38,725 --> 00:11:40,595
Yeah?

133
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:03,954
Somebody's casing the joint.

134
00:12:04,317 --> 00:12:06,861
It's probably one of those auto dialers.

135
00:12:07,454 --> 00:12:10,924
Lowest form of organic life,
the telemarketer.

136
00:12:10,925 --> 00:12:13,796
Anyway, I'll call the phone company.

137
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:20,513
Oh, gees, you look good.

138
00:12:20,702 --> 00:12:23,369
You should have seen me at bedtime.

139
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,571
Deej, I was stranded out there.

140
00:12:25,572 --> 00:12:28,474
Sounded dangerously like a bar,
not a garage.

141
00:12:28,476 --> 00:12:30,244
I was waiting in a bar.

142
00:12:30,245 --> 00:12:33,118
Whatever.
I'm not launching an investigation.

143
00:12:33,448 --> 00:12:35,920
I've got Jane Eyre for a lover, anyway.

144
00:12:37,218 --> 00:12:40,721
I could have been a highway statistic
yesterday and you're giving me shit.

145
00:12:40,722 --> 00:12:44,971
You drive too fast.
And you're always on the stupid phone.

146
00:12:47,661 --> 00:12:49,262
Oh, damn, you look good.

147
00:12:49,263 --> 00:12:51,398
Jimmy, don't. I'm showing a four bedroom.

148
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:53,268
All I said was you look good.

149
00:12:53,269 --> 00:12:54,835
Yeah, well, you say that, then...

150
00:12:54,836 --> 00:12:56,337
Hey, I was thinking,

151
00:12:56,338 --> 00:12:58,806
that split second
before I almost became road meat...

152
00:12:58,807 --> 00:12:59,939
Fuck you, don't even joke.

153
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:02,576
...how I'd miss the smell of your hair,

154
00:13:02,577 --> 00:13:05,380
the soft curve of your neck.

155
00:13:05,381 --> 00:13:09,095
How I might check out
without touching my angel one last time.

156
00:13:10,452 --> 00:13:13,256
- You thought all that in one second?
- Yeah.

157
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:19,898
It's amazing,
this guy still thinks he's getting laid.

158
00:13:24,633 --> 00:13:26,768
Hey, Jimmy, you up yet? It's Roy.

159
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:29,704
I got a little situation for you to handle.
It's Lopez.

160
00:13:29,705 --> 00:13:31,144
God damn it, Jimmy!

161
00:13:33,043 --> 00:13:34,809
You wanna know something about Roy?

162
00:13:34,810 --> 00:13:37,680
Roy has nightmares
about giving me a gringo account.

163
00:13:37,681 --> 00:13:39,849
He thinks I'm gonna pull up
in a cholomobile

164
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:42,118
with a 3-D Virgin Mary air freshener.

165
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:44,753
Roy may be a hard-on,
but he's one-tenth the asshole

166
00:13:44,754 --> 00:13:46,621
than some of the guys
you're gonna meet out there.

167
00:13:46,622 --> 00:13:50,634
It's a tricky game, Andy.
No one tells you when the rules change.

168
00:13:50,861 --> 00:13:53,062
But you've got a hell of a future.
You know that?

169
00:13:53,063 --> 00:13:55,164
Always been one of my sharpest guys.

170
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:56,798
Thank you.

171
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,433
Big dreamer though, huh?

172
00:13:58,434 --> 00:13:59,801
- I got that from you.
- Yeah?

173
00:13:59,802 --> 00:14:02,710
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Always looking for those shortcuts.

174
00:14:03,241 --> 00:14:04,907
But, hey, what does it matter?

175
00:14:04,908 --> 00:14:08,486
You know, this company is just one eddy
in a big old river.

176
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,449
I'm getting out myself in the next
couple of months.

177
00:14:12,450 --> 00:14:15,926
- What do you mean, getting out?
- I got jukeboxes to sell.

178
00:14:18,523 --> 00:14:21,133
Jimmy, what are we doing here?

179
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:26,269
Wait a minute. Wait a sec.

180
00:14:26,731 --> 00:14:30,979
It's the audit, Andy.
Roy flipped about your expense sheets.

181
00:14:31,903 --> 00:14:33,204
Shit!

182
00:14:34,973 --> 00:14:37,574
Well, I can explain that.
We can explain that to Roy, right?

183
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:38,743
He's gonna understand.

184
00:14:38,744 --> 00:14:41,512
Because of everything
that I had to pay for these last few months

185
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:42,779
with the kid coming.

186
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,682
And you practically taught me
how to pad my sheets.

187
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:46,817
You got nailed, kid. Not my rules, okay?

188
00:14:46,818 --> 00:14:49,187
What do you mean, not my rules?
I don't understand.

189
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:51,690
Same guy that told me the rules,

190
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:54,425
"Fuck the rules. Don't worry about it, Andy.

191
00:14:54,426 --> 00:14:57,061
- "It's okay. I'll show you the ropes. "
- I don't know that that's exactly what I said.

192
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,165
That's exactly what you said!
This is the same son of a bitch, huh?

193
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,566
- Shit, Andy!
- I can't believe you!

194
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,669
Andy, if it wasn't for me you would have
blown your fucking job a year ago, okay?

195
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,737
- Save that bullshit, gabacho!
- This is an expensive fucking suit!

196
00:15:06,738 --> 00:15:09,885
- Fuck your suit! All right, pendejo?
- Nice.

197
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:14,420
Couldn't do it, Jimmy, huh?

198
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,815
You couldn't even take off the shades.

199
00:15:16,816 --> 00:15:19,250
Get your hand off my car, Lopez.

200
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:20,862
Fuck you.

201
00:15:25,692 --> 00:15:27,159
Damn.

202
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,839
Hey, Jimmy! Come on, where you been?
You're missing the game!

203
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:36,076
Are we losing?

204
00:15:37,004 --> 00:15:41,272
This is how legends get started, right here.
Who could have predicted it folks, huh?

205
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:43,376
Mark Leavens' incredible comeback
from injuries

206
00:15:43,377 --> 00:15:44,910
most thought would end his season.

207
00:15:44,912 --> 00:15:46,212
Pass it in...

208
00:15:46,213 --> 00:15:48,721
Defense! Defense! Come on!

209
00:15:49,416 --> 00:15:52,026
This guy couldn't walk three days ago.

210
00:15:52,385 --> 00:15:55,221
They were up by 12, like, what,
two, three, minutes ago, right?

211
00:15:55,222 --> 00:15:57,503
Right? Come on.

212
00:15:58,425 --> 00:15:59,660
What?

213
00:15:59,661 --> 00:16:02,528
You shouldn't bet against
the home team, baby. It's bad luck.

214
00:16:02,529 --> 00:16:04,571
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

215
00:16:07,302 --> 00:16:10,083
...is that it? Yeah? The other way around.

216
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:18,112
- Hey, guys! Ladies.
- Hey, Roy.

217
00:16:18,113 --> 00:16:19,413
Catch them, Wolves?

218
00:16:19,414 --> 00:16:21,815
Yeah. Yeah, $150 down.

219
00:16:21,816 --> 00:16:23,417
Unbelievable, huh?

220
00:16:23,418 --> 00:16:26,120
Hey Jim boy, come by the bar
when you get a sec. Okay, buddy?

221
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:28,526
- Yeah, okay.
- See you later, guys.

222
00:16:30,358 --> 00:16:35,040
Hey, what? You know, he just wants some
advice from the... The oracle.

223
00:16:35,965 --> 00:16:38,232
You know, the guru.

224
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:40,741
I don't need anymore of this.

225
00:16:41,871 --> 00:16:44,880
I really appreciate you handling Lopez.

226
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:49,877
You know, a lot of guys turn a whining
pussy, you throw them a challenge.

227
00:16:49,878 --> 00:16:51,555
Well...

228
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:54,619
- Here's to success.
- Success.

229
00:16:58,287 --> 00:17:01,455
I had an interesting time down in Dallas.
That goddamn convention.

230
00:17:01,456 --> 00:17:02,524
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

231
00:17:02,525 --> 00:17:05,461
I'm sitting in some little dive
somewhere, having a few,

232
00:17:05,462 --> 00:17:08,931
and there's this jukebox in the corner
full of scratchy old records.

233
00:17:08,932 --> 00:17:12,067
Just like those Waswizzlers
you've been talking about.

234
00:17:12,068 --> 00:17:15,214
- Wurlitzer’s.
- Yeah, right, whatever.

235
00:17:15,405 --> 00:17:18,186
Anyway, all night long I'm sitting there,

236
00:17:18,241 --> 00:17:22,345
I'm watching people lining up
to stuff this thing full of money,

237
00:17:22,346 --> 00:17:25,388
and then it hits me.

238
00:17:25,449 --> 00:17:29,721
It's the intangibles,
just like Jimmy Starks said.

239
00:17:30,088 --> 00:17:32,021
Well, nostalgia is a powerful thing.

240
00:17:32,022 --> 00:17:34,291
I think we're gonna give your idea a whirl.

241
00:17:34,292 --> 00:17:36,292
We'll maybe scale back a bit,

242
00:17:36,293 --> 00:17:39,269
but who knows?
We could be sitting on a winner here.

243
00:17:39,297 --> 00:17:41,832
Roy, shit. Man, this is great.

244
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:46,168
I mean, I've done the numbers.
This thing is... Real solid.

245
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:47,635
Did you say Dallas?

246
00:17:47,636 --> 00:17:52,513
- Dallas, Texas. The selfsame.
- Yeah.

247
00:17:53,411 --> 00:17:55,579
Come by tomorrow
before you hit the pavement.

248
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:58,087
We'll start working out the details.

249
00:18:11,629 --> 00:18:13,807
Jimmy.

250
00:18:14,832 --> 00:18:17,200
I thought I'd have to peel you off the ceiling
when I told you.

251
00:18:17,201 --> 00:18:21,339
No, no, this is fantastic. I'm very happy.
Let's get it rolling, huh?

252
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,587
All right. Good man.

253
00:19:03,984 --> 00:19:06,696
Can't they leave you alone on a Saturday?

254
00:19:07,654 --> 00:19:09,161
Yeah?

255
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:15,436
You smell good.

256
00:19:16,997 --> 00:19:19,106
Today? It can't wait?

257
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:23,239
Yeah, okay. I'll come in.

258
00:19:26,941 --> 00:19:29,687
No, no, I know. Yep.

259
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,614
Everything okay?

260
00:19:34,615 --> 00:19:37,851
Yeah, yeah.
It's just the check-up I had last week.

261
00:19:37,852 --> 00:19:40,463
They did an EKG 'cause of my old man.

262
00:19:40,788 --> 00:19:42,956
They said they saw a spike
or something on there,

263
00:19:42,957 --> 00:19:45,659
wanna have a closer look.

264
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,862
- Do they think it's serious?
- Oh, no, no, no.

265
00:19:47,863 --> 00:19:51,599
It's just, the machine's free and they
need another look, that's all.

266
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,345
- I'll go with you.
- No, it's all right.

267
00:19:55,971 --> 00:20:00,243
- Okay. I'm gonna go home.
- No, no, stay here. It won't take long.

268
00:20:09,551 --> 00:20:12,890
What we're looking at here
is a mitral valve prolapse.

269
00:20:13,322 --> 00:20:15,957
- What the hell's that?
- Kind of a lazy valve.

270
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:20,730
Heart squeezes blood, valve doesn't close
all the way, some of it back-flows.

271
00:20:20,862 --> 00:20:23,331
It's usually a benign condition.

272
00:20:23,332 --> 00:20:25,271
Lazy valve? Okay.

273
00:20:26,435 --> 00:20:29,683
So basically I'm okay?
You didn't see anything else?

274
00:20:29,871 --> 00:20:32,541
We'll schedule you for another echo
in six months or so.

275
00:20:32,542 --> 00:20:35,585
Keep an eye on that valve. But otherwise...

276
00:20:37,947 --> 00:20:40,751
Come on, we'll go out this weekend.

277
00:20:41,183 --> 00:20:46,593
I mean, I know the house needs work,
but it's 10 acres in Taos.

278
00:20:46,656 --> 00:20:48,834
Yeah.

279
00:20:51,595 --> 00:20:55,002
Relax, Jimmy.
I'm not picking out china patterns.

280
00:20:58,168 --> 00:21:01,348
Hey, do you want to get us some ice cream?

281
00:21:02,573 --> 00:21:05,548
- What are you, 15?
- Yeah. Come on.

282
00:21:06,809 --> 00:21:10,581
- All right. Come with me.
- No, I'm gonna have a smoke.

283
00:21:11,448 --> 00:21:14,819
- All right. What do you want?
- Chocolate cherry.

284
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,531
- Okay. I'll be right back.
- Thank you.

285
00:21:34,606 --> 00:21:37,410
You are a hard worker, industrious.

286
00:21:37,843 --> 00:21:39,509
An Aries, no?

287
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:41,188
No, Taurus.

288
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:45,582
Of course. The ridges
along the Mount of Jupiter tell the tale.

289
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:47,852
What about the...

290
00:21:47,853 --> 00:21:50,988
You know, what do you call it? The lifeline?

291
00:21:50,989 --> 00:21:52,690
Any way of...

292
00:21:52,691 --> 00:21:58,339
Three bracelets of life.
Perhaps four. Very deep. Defined.

293
00:21:59,064 --> 00:22:00,365
Is that good?

294
00:22:00,366 --> 00:22:04,171
Seventy-five years at least. 100 at most.

295
00:22:04,402 --> 00:22:06,809
Long life. Good fate.

296
00:22:09,908 --> 00:22:12,810
What? What? What?

297
00:22:12,811 --> 00:22:14,989
Mommy, this is broken.

298
00:22:15,514 --> 00:22:18,816
I told you, stay in the other room.
Go on now, Mommy's working.

299
00:22:18,817 --> 00:22:20,722
I am most sorry.

300
00:22:24,891 --> 00:22:26,557
Let me ask you about fate.

301
00:22:26,558 --> 00:22:28,427
Is that something that can be changed?

302
00:22:28,428 --> 00:22:31,363
You know, like, if I knew something
was gonna happen, if I could see it coming,

303
00:22:31,364 --> 00:22:32,531
could I...

304
00:22:32,532 --> 00:22:34,801
Each life is a tapestry.

305
00:22:34,802 --> 00:22:37,770
Some threads are woven tightly,
cannot be altered.

306
00:22:37,771 --> 00:22:42,350
But others are looser.
With these we weave the story of our lives.

307
00:22:42,709 --> 00:22:44,576
Thanks.

308
00:22:44,577 --> 00:22:48,485
Thank you. Thank you, sir. Come again.

309
00:24:31,889 --> 00:24:34,222
Bet you didn't figure
on seeing me again, huh?

310
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:36,766
Then again, maybe you did.

311
00:24:41,598 --> 00:24:43,879
You going somewhere?

312
00:24:44,835 --> 00:24:49,642
I like to do some fishing up at Abiquiu Lake.
Good this time of year.

313
00:24:50,007 --> 00:24:52,380
I hear you.

314
00:24:53,411 --> 00:24:56,350
Listen, about last time...

315
00:24:57,047 --> 00:24:58,850
What about it?

316
00:24:58,882 --> 00:25:01,250
Well, I gotta tell you,
when I first came over here,

317
00:25:01,251 --> 00:25:02,685
I didn't buy it, the whole shtick.

318
00:25:02,686 --> 00:25:05,525
- I gave you your money back.
- I know.

319
00:25:06,124 --> 00:25:08,233
But certain things have happened.

320
00:25:09,459 --> 00:25:14,209
Coincidences. You know,
stuff you couldn't have known unless...

321
00:25:15,034 --> 00:25:17,901
I'm a performer, Mr. Starks.

322
00:25:17,902 --> 00:25:21,342
A salesman. You said it yourself.

323
00:25:22,739 --> 00:25:24,042
Yeah.

324
00:25:24,709 --> 00:25:26,778
A performer doesn't stop
halfway through an act,

325
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:29,546
and a salesman
certainly doesn't give refunds.

326
00:25:29,547 --> 00:25:34,024
Now, the Wolves game, this money my boss
promises me, out of the blue.

327
00:25:34,152 --> 00:25:37,059
You knew that was coming from Dallas.

328
00:25:37,523 --> 00:25:39,792
What are the chances of that?

329
00:25:39,793 --> 00:25:43,835
A few lucky guesses. My gift to you.

330
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:48,266
That seizure thing you had,

331
00:25:48,267 --> 00:25:51,516
what was up with that?
You see something or what?

332
00:25:52,403 --> 00:25:58,246
Even if I could see things,
what would it matter?

333
00:25:59,612 --> 00:26:03,589
Go live your life. Forget about all this.

334
00:26:09,455 --> 00:26:13,260
Listen, I'm sure you've got some
code of ethics or something,

335
00:26:13,261 --> 00:26:17,565
but I had a bit of a scare a few days ago.
My health. Is that it?

336
00:26:18,198 --> 00:26:20,034
Good day.

337
00:26:20,699 --> 00:26:24,415
Okay. I want another reading.

338
00:26:33,413 --> 00:26:35,382
I'm not open for business.

339
00:26:35,383 --> 00:26:37,459
I'll pay you double.

340
00:26:39,086 --> 00:26:41,687
Come on, you're a businessman. Take it.

341
00:26:41,688 --> 00:26:45,631
Am I missing something here?
What's the angle, old man?

342
00:26:46,627 --> 00:26:48,738
You had your reading.

343
00:26:50,498 --> 00:26:55,111
Now listen, you have no right
to fuck with people like this.

344
00:26:56,002 --> 00:26:58,717
So I want another goddamn reading.

345
00:27:05,313 --> 00:27:10,361
I saw no more roads. No more tomorrows.

346
00:27:12,488 --> 00:27:14,767
Not much time left.

347
00:27:16,959 --> 00:27:18,602
I'm sorry.

348
00:27:18,826 --> 00:27:20,630
Is that right?

349
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,980
Well, how much time?

350
00:27:27,301 --> 00:27:30,303
I may as well know, how does it happen?

351
00:27:30,304 --> 00:27:34,316
The vision comes in images
and impressions.

352
00:27:35,712 --> 00:27:38,322
I don't have the specifics you want.

353
00:27:39,648 --> 00:27:45,901
One thing is certain.
You're safe until the first snow.

354
00:27:46,589 --> 00:27:50,564
The first snow? Oh.

355
00:27:50,727 --> 00:27:54,270
Well, shit, I guess I better pack up
and move to Florida.

356
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:04,218
What a fucking trip.

357
00:28:07,411 --> 00:28:11,022
What carnival freak show
they fire you from, anyway?

358
00:29:37,002 --> 00:29:41,740
We got a million square feet up for grabs.
What are you doing about it?

359
00:29:41,741 --> 00:29:45,878
Garcia Brothers are out there
eating your lunch. Eating your future.

360
00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:48,716
One square foot at a time.

361
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:52,595
- Jimmy?
- Jimbo!

362
00:29:54,721 --> 00:29:57,021
He's dreaming jukeboxes, what can I say?

363
00:29:57,022 --> 00:29:59,224
- Oh, sorry.
- Come on, guys, look sharp.

364
00:29:59,225 --> 00:30:03,600
What's the story on Knob Hill?
You got a bite on this Moreland guy?

365
00:30:05,566 --> 00:30:07,139
Yeah. Yeah.

366
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,807
You're shitting me.

367
00:30:14,809 --> 00:30:19,245
Some trailer park Kreskin grabs your hand
and tells you you're toast?

368
00:30:19,246 --> 00:30:22,494
Think about that, Jimmy.

369
00:30:25,052 --> 00:30:28,766
We're always so sure
we're calling the shots in life. Right?

370
00:30:31,459 --> 00:30:34,536
Maybe we're just playing it out.

371
00:30:37,365 --> 00:30:39,612
What, like...

372
00:30:39,935 --> 00:30:44,003
Like, I was destined
to order this chicken noodle soup, here?

373
00:30:44,004 --> 00:30:46,514
You're out of my area here, Jimmy.

374
00:30:48,477 --> 00:30:50,758
Ask any cop.

375
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:54,814
Obvious answer is usually the right one.
You got played.

376
00:30:54,815 --> 00:30:58,565
I bet that was your first instinct.
Come on, admit it.

377
00:30:59,856 --> 00:31:02,758
You wait. Next, he'll offer
to talk to the big guy on your behalf.

378
00:31:02,759 --> 00:31:06,404
First, it's the hard-boiled eggs
under the pillow,

379
00:31:07,529 --> 00:31:08,629
and then it's,

380
00:31:08,630 --> 00:31:10,866
"Could you empty out
that savings account?"

381
00:31:10,867 --> 00:31:13,268
I'm telling you, these guys are good.

382
00:31:13,269 --> 00:31:15,769
- They're good. They get inside your head.
- He didn't even mention money.

383
00:31:15,771 --> 00:31:18,772
Oh, come on, money? He's patient.
He figures you're not a superstitious guy.

384
00:31:18,774 --> 00:31:19,941
He takes a lucky guess.

385
00:31:19,942 --> 00:31:22,277
Luck doesn't explain
the Wolves game though, does it?

386
00:31:22,278 --> 00:31:25,280
You think he didn't size you up?
Observe every detail?

387
00:31:25,281 --> 00:31:29,689
He saw the Wolves sticker on your bumper.
Figured you had money on the game.

388
00:31:29,952 --> 00:31:32,688
- Dallas. He knew about the money.
- He plays the percentages.

389
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:35,557
One guy takes the bait,
another 50 he never sees again,

390
00:31:35,558 --> 00:31:38,432
and he leaves you looking under every rock.

391
00:31:39,629 --> 00:31:43,377
Hey, you remember...
Yeah, I'll have a little more, thank you.

392
00:31:48,339 --> 00:31:50,372
She's new... No, no.

393
00:31:50,373 --> 00:31:53,041
Do you remember when we were kids we
used to play that game on the highway?

394
00:31:53,042 --> 00:31:55,346
What was it? To see
how many red Volkswagens you could spot?

395
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:57,320
- Spud.
- Spud, yeah.

396
00:31:58,415 --> 00:32:01,992
You see an awful lot of them
once you start looking.

397
00:32:02,286 --> 00:32:05,822
You, my friend, are in a funk.
Take a day. Take a weekend.

398
00:32:05,823 --> 00:32:08,400
Go away with Dee. Really. Let this go.

399
00:32:09,194 --> 00:32:10,804
Let it go.

400
00:32:12,162 --> 00:32:14,601
Yeah, maybe you're right.

401
00:32:14,797 --> 00:32:18,202
All right, all right, good.
Aye, aye, aye. Jen. Jen!

402
00:32:18,203 --> 00:32:20,704
Would you get him
some chili cheese fries or something?

403
00:32:20,705 --> 00:32:24,884
He's eating a salad.
Don't ever serve him a salad again. It goes...

404
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,316
Fuck off.

405
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:37,023
Wow. Never mind that trip to Paris.

406
00:32:40,825 --> 00:32:45,838
Champagne. And not a cigarette all night.

407
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:51,006
- I like this new Jimmy.
- Yeah?

408
00:32:52,171 --> 00:32:55,942
Well, right now, this new Jimmy
would sell you for a cigarette.

409
00:33:18,265 --> 00:33:20,272
Yeah?

410
00:33:21,068 --> 00:33:23,006
Hello?

411
00:34:00,441 --> 00:34:01,842
This is private property.

412
00:34:01,843 --> 00:34:03,944
- Yeah, so is my mailbox.
- Excuse me?

413
00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:06,513
Listen, I don't like the way
things went down either. Okay?

414
00:34:06,514 --> 00:34:08,615
I think you got the short end.
I told that to Roy.

415
00:34:08,616 --> 00:34:10,016
You're a saint, thank you.

416
00:34:10,017 --> 00:34:12,120
Hey, I'm not the guy, Andy.
It was fucking management's decision.

417
00:34:12,121 --> 00:34:14,187
One word from you
would have spared me from Roy.

418
00:34:14,189 --> 00:34:15,989
So I don't know what the fuck
you're talking about, okay?

419
00:34:15,990 --> 00:34:18,226
You sell me out for your jukeboxes,

420
00:34:18,227 --> 00:34:20,027
and now it's keeping you up at night.
Well, tough...

421
00:34:20,028 --> 00:34:21,962
Just don't come near my house again.
Okay?

422
00:34:21,963 --> 00:34:23,463
What the fuck is that?

423
00:34:23,464 --> 00:34:25,500
What?
You leaving little presents in my mailbox?

424
00:34:25,501 --> 00:34:27,635
Hanging around the office like some
pissed off postal worker?

425
00:34:27,636 --> 00:34:29,971
You're smoking too much yaho, gringo.
You need to get off that shit.

426
00:34:29,972 --> 00:34:33,039
Hey, I'm not fucking around here, Andy.
Okay? The cops know.

427
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,742
- So anything happens to me...
- Who the fuck are you, eh?

428
00:34:34,743 --> 00:34:36,010
Anything happens to me
and they're coming here!

429
00:34:36,011 --> 00:34:38,746
Who the fuck are you?
Okay, I bust my ass to get work,

430
00:34:38,747 --> 00:34:41,216
- and you're spreading false shit about me!
- You've been warned!

431
00:34:41,217 --> 00:34:43,218
- I swear you ruin my name, Jimmy...
- Andy.

432
00:34:43,219 --> 00:34:45,018
- What? What are you gonna do?
- What am I gonna do? Huh?

433
00:34:45,019 --> 00:34:46,891
Yeah, what are you gonna do?

434
00:34:50,759 --> 00:34:53,228
Okay.
Get out of here before I change my mind.

435
00:34:53,229 --> 00:34:55,269
It stops now. Okay?

436
00:35:08,777 --> 00:35:10,779
So how you been, man?

437
00:35:10,781 --> 00:35:13,081
Oh, you know, still in the game.

438
00:35:13,082 --> 00:35:15,851
- How's Katie?
- Oh, Jesus, it's been that long?

439
00:35:15,852 --> 00:35:18,156
Oh, shit. Sorry to hear that.

440
00:35:18,687 --> 00:35:23,028
- That's okay. We're both much better off.
- Good.

441
00:35:23,593 --> 00:35:25,127
You got restrooms in this place?

442
00:35:25,128 --> 00:35:26,362
Of course, why?

443
00:35:26,363 --> 00:35:29,797
It looks like people been pissing on
your floors. Who the hell put these down?

444
00:35:29,799 --> 00:35:31,500
Garcia Brothers.

445
00:35:31,501 --> 00:35:33,903
Oh, God. Yeah, I know them.
Fucking bandits.

446
00:35:33,904 --> 00:35:35,206
Yeah.

447
00:35:35,606 --> 00:35:38,541
Hey, you'll never guess
who I ran across a few days ago.

448
00:35:38,542 --> 00:35:40,982
Mrs. McClure. Vincent's mom.

449
00:35:45,550 --> 00:35:48,452
She blacked out in Tabard's going
through the discount bins.

450
00:35:48,453 --> 00:35:52,522
But she's one tough old broad.
Wouldn't let me call an ambulance.

451
00:35:52,523 --> 00:35:56,126
I wasn't going to let her leave but she
told me Vince was waiting in the car,

452
00:35:56,127 --> 00:35:58,738
and he's looking after her now.

453
00:35:58,864 --> 00:36:01,770
- Vince is here? In town?
- Yeah.

454
00:36:03,235 --> 00:36:04,767
I thought he was still in Oklahoma.

455
00:36:04,768 --> 00:36:08,574
Yeah, I heard that too. Guess he got parole.

456
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,642
Hey, what do you think
landed him in Creedmoor, huh?

457
00:36:11,643 --> 00:36:13,514
I heard some fucking stories.

458
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:16,158
I don't know.

459
00:36:16,481 --> 00:36:20,094
- I guess you two don't...
- No, no. Not for a long time.

460
00:36:20,819 --> 00:36:24,693
You guys ever get a chance to, you know,
square things up, or...

461
00:36:24,757 --> 00:36:26,391
Nothing to square up, Tom.

462
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:29,605
He took his road, I took mine. End of story.

463
00:37:08,936 --> 00:37:12,685
Yeah, yeah, I know.
The thing is, I'm sitting here in crazy traffic.

464
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:15,408
Yeah, I know.
It's like a tractor-trailer situation.

465
00:37:15,409 --> 00:37:17,053
It's very ugly.

466
00:37:17,678 --> 00:37:20,084
Next week sounds great. Okay.

467
00:37:20,514 --> 00:37:23,482
We could be looking
at an early winter here, folks.

468
00:37:23,483 --> 00:37:26,161
Get out those hats and gloves.

469
00:38:02,024 --> 00:38:05,430
Oh, hi, Mrs. McClure.

470
00:38:07,596 --> 00:38:11,002
I never thought I'd see you
on that couch again.

471
00:38:13,068 --> 00:38:15,177
You and Vincent.

472
00:38:16,505 --> 00:38:19,753
I remember when your feet
didn't touch the floor.

473
00:38:20,309 --> 00:38:23,853
Sorry I woke you up.
I know you like your afternoon nap.

474
00:38:24,613 --> 00:38:27,615
There'll be plenty of time
for sleeping soon enough,

475
00:38:27,616 --> 00:38:29,450
if the doctors are half right.

476
00:38:29,451 --> 00:38:32,062
Don't say that. You look great.

477
00:38:32,388 --> 00:38:35,135
Still got a gift for the bullshit.

478
00:38:39,028 --> 00:38:40,969
I'm dying, Jimmy.

479
00:38:45,401 --> 00:38:47,410
Sorry, I...

480
00:38:50,874 --> 00:38:55,749
So, what brings you around?

481
00:38:56,479 --> 00:38:58,947
Well, I heard Vince was in town
taking care of you.

482
00:38:58,948 --> 00:39:00,849
Who told you that?

483
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:03,820
Just a friend.
He runs the shopping center in Knob Hill.

484
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:06,829
Oh, yeah, that brat.

485
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:12,307
You know what they do
to old ladies living alone?

486
00:39:13,364 --> 00:39:16,976
Especially ones with dizzy spells.

487
00:39:17,635 --> 00:39:20,401
They ship them to the rest farm.

488
00:39:20,437 --> 00:39:23,652
Oh, so Vince hasn't been around, huh?

489
00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:28,785
Oh, I don't know, James.

490
00:39:29,815 --> 00:39:33,083
No. Vincent's been doing real well lately.

491
00:39:33,085 --> 00:39:36,458
He's got himself some construction work.

492
00:39:37,688 --> 00:39:42,700
And he's off the booze,
and those goddamn drugs.

493
00:39:44,563 --> 00:39:47,531
- I don't think he needs to dig up any...
- I don't want to cause trouble. I...

494
00:39:47,532 --> 00:39:52,305
You should have looked out for him more.
He needed that.

495
00:39:53,105 --> 00:39:56,216
Broke his heart the way things turned out.

496
00:39:57,342 --> 00:40:02,024
- Well, we were young and stupid.
- You weren't stupid, Jimmy.

497
00:40:05,050 --> 00:40:06,389
Excuse me.

498
00:40:16,629 --> 00:40:18,897
You mind if I poke my head
in Vince's old room?

499
00:40:18,898 --> 00:40:20,303
What?

500
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,111
Lot of memories here, you know.

501
00:40:23,603 --> 00:40:25,713
You know where it is.

502
00:41:39,014 --> 00:41:40,881
When did you say Vince was here last?

503
00:41:40,882 --> 00:41:45,292
I didn't.
That'd be violating his parole, wouldn't it?

504
00:41:49,492 --> 00:41:52,533
I got a good feeling this time.

505
00:42:01,605 --> 00:42:05,139
Vincent knows
he won't have me around much longer.

506
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:08,081
First time in his life he'll be alone.

507
00:42:09,178 --> 00:42:14,394
I made a full pot, just in case you wanted...
Jimmy!

508
00:43:01,565 --> 00:43:03,833
- Hey.
- Hi. Remember the redhead?

509
00:43:03,834 --> 00:43:05,534
The one that was at the end of the bar?

510
00:43:05,535 --> 00:43:06,870
She's in the trunk?

511
00:43:06,871 --> 00:43:10,586
Hey, so, I need you to take my calls today.

512
00:43:10,976 --> 00:43:13,009
- This the new weekly ritual?
- No, no, no.

513
00:43:13,010 --> 00:43:16,280
I'm swamped today.
And Roy's been getting service complaints.

514
00:43:16,281 --> 00:43:17,714
- No, he is not.
- I'm not kidding you,

515
00:43:17,715 --> 00:43:19,683
he asked me
if you were having personal problems.

516
00:43:19,684 --> 00:43:22,453
Besides the fact that he tells me
that he puts 100 grand down

517
00:43:22,454 --> 00:43:24,821
on a certain jukebox project.
That was your baby, Jimmy.

518
00:43:24,822 --> 00:43:26,823
Yeah, well. That's gonna have to wait.
Can you cover me or not?

519
00:43:26,824 --> 00:43:30,198
- Apparently so. What's up?
- Come on. I gotta take a trip.

520
00:43:30,895 --> 00:43:32,798
It doesn't have anything to do
with a certain fortune teller?

521
00:43:32,799 --> 00:43:35,409
No, no, no. It's personal shit.

522
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,901
- I need coffee, man, come on.
- Here.

523
00:43:36,902 --> 00:43:38,402
I wanna talk to you. I don't want your coffee.

524
00:43:38,403 --> 00:43:39,876
I gotta go.

525
00:43:40,439 --> 00:43:42,306
Carlos is gonna call at 3:00,
so make sure you take it.

526
00:43:42,307 --> 00:43:44,748
I'd like to talk to you for...

527
00:43:44,877 --> 00:43:48,213
- I love you.
- Yeah, you know, let me ask you...

528
00:43:48,214 --> 00:43:52,283
Would you characterize our thing here
as a close friendship?

529
00:43:52,284 --> 00:43:54,720
Yeah. Close as two adult males
probably ought to get.

530
00:43:54,721 --> 00:43:56,689
Yeah.
So as a close friend, I'd like to, you know...

531
00:43:56,690 --> 00:43:58,756
I feel it my duty to voice
my profound concern over...

532
00:43:58,757 --> 00:44:00,825
- Are you gonna cover me or not?
- These little...

533
00:44:00,826 --> 00:44:03,027
No. No, actually I'm not.

534
00:44:03,028 --> 00:44:05,163
You're not gonna level with me?
Don't snow the snowman.

535
00:44:05,164 --> 00:44:07,468
Ed, come on. Hey, hey, hey.

536
00:44:07,634 --> 00:44:12,405
Okay, listen. The target in my mailbox.

537
00:44:12,939 --> 00:44:14,947
Lopez may not be the guy.

538
00:44:14,974 --> 00:44:16,808
- Really? Wow. I'm sorry.
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

539
00:44:16,809 --> 00:44:20,346
I think it's a valentine from an old buddy
who just got paroled from Creedmoor.

540
00:44:20,347 --> 00:44:23,015
So you're gonna go down there
and fuck with him like you did Lopez?

541
00:44:23,016 --> 00:44:25,084
- That worked out really well.
- No, he's not gonna know I'm there.

542
00:44:25,085 --> 00:44:27,553
- It'll be reconnaissance.
- Reconnaissance?

543
00:44:27,554 --> 00:44:30,724
Oh, what are you, a Navy Seal? Call a cop.
Call his parole officer.

544
00:44:30,725 --> 00:44:32,591
Come on, the guy could be
a fucking nut job.

545
00:44:32,592 --> 00:44:35,271
Yeah, exactly. So help me out, will you?

546
00:44:37,964 --> 00:44:40,508
I'm hung over and... Ah, fuck it.

547
00:45:00,354 --> 00:45:03,364
Get off the fucking road, man. Jesus.

548
00:48:36,610 --> 00:48:38,185
Oh, wow.

549
00:49:19,655 --> 00:49:23,994
Fuck! Fuckers locked me out
because I'm a day late?

550
00:49:33,436 --> 00:49:35,740
Hey, fuck!

551
00:50:09,473 --> 00:50:11,276
Oh, shit!

552
00:50:31,362 --> 00:50:32,800
Shit!

553
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:41,978
Okay. Good. Thank you.

554
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:45,915
- Yes, I will let him know.
- Who's that?

555
00:50:47,045 --> 00:50:49,223
Okay. Thank you.

556
00:50:51,717 --> 00:50:54,084
That was the phone company.

557
00:50:54,085 --> 00:50:56,253
You know the weird hang-up calls
you were getting?

558
00:50:56,254 --> 00:50:57,989
Yeah.

559
00:50:57,990 --> 00:51:01,865
Telemarketing computer.
They took care of it.

560
00:51:04,497 --> 00:51:07,331
- They sure?
- Yeah, that's what they said.

561
00:51:07,332 --> 00:51:09,112
Oh, good.

562
00:51:13,139 --> 00:51:15,852
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah.

563
00:51:16,309 --> 00:51:18,987
Good. Can you make us something?

564
00:51:29,956 --> 00:51:31,429
Hello?

565
00:51:33,393 --> 00:51:37,163
- I don't fucking believe this.
- How's it hanging, partner?

566
00:51:37,164 --> 00:51:38,665
Who's this?

567
00:51:38,666 --> 00:51:40,799
Come on, you don't know?

568
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,410
I'm hurt.

569
00:51:44,839 --> 00:51:47,774
- Still there?
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm still here.

570
00:51:47,775 --> 00:51:51,318
- Who the hell is it?
- It's okay. Hang on a second.

571
00:51:58,553 --> 00:52:01,021
- Hey, is that Katie?
- No.

572
00:52:01,022 --> 00:52:03,489
Gees, another statistic.

573
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:07,205
- Hey, if you need a shoulder...
- It's a little late, Vincent.

574
00:52:07,262 --> 00:52:10,163
Aren't you gonna ask me how I've been?

575
00:52:10,164 --> 00:52:11,531
Yeah. How've you been?

576
00:52:11,533 --> 00:52:14,177
Peaches, man. Thanks for asking.

577
00:52:14,702 --> 00:52:17,506
- So how'd you like my setup?
- Huh?

578
00:52:17,873 --> 00:52:20,975
My little joint here.
I'm planning a few home improvements.

579
00:52:20,976 --> 00:52:23,155
But what'd you think?

580
00:52:24,613 --> 00:52:27,548
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Maybe I got it all wrong.

581
00:52:27,549 --> 00:52:29,384
First I hear you drop by to see Mom.

582
00:52:29,385 --> 00:52:32,921
Next thing I see is that a New Mexico plate's
hauling ass out of my lot.

583
00:52:32,922 --> 00:52:36,391
Yeah. You know, I did drop in
to see your mom. Yeah.

584
00:52:36,392 --> 00:52:38,825
Good. You're the son she always wanted.

585
00:52:38,826 --> 00:52:41,162
Maybe that Chevy was just a coincidence.

586
00:52:41,163 --> 00:52:44,832
Yeah, you're probably all dandied
in a shiny Kraut-Cruiser by now.

587
00:52:44,834 --> 00:52:48,471
- Beemer. Something classy.
- Not quite. No.

588
00:52:48,472 --> 00:52:51,872
You know, I should come up
and check out your setup sometime.

589
00:52:51,873 --> 00:52:54,910
Well, I thought you already had.
I got your little calling card.

590
00:52:54,911 --> 00:52:56,946
Can't say I know what you mean, partner.

591
00:52:56,947 --> 00:53:00,315
My PO's got my nuts in a vice.
You know, work, shit, sleep.

592
00:53:00,316 --> 00:53:03,462
Almost had to wear those 24 hour bracelets.

593
00:53:05,087 --> 00:53:06,522
Where are you calling from, Vince?

594
00:53:06,523 --> 00:53:10,426
Home sweet.
Out on my deck with my cell phone,

595
00:53:10,427 --> 00:53:12,694
sipping a drink by the in-ground pool.

596
00:53:12,695 --> 00:53:16,001
Hey, this new girl of yours,
does she treat you right?

597
00:53:16,133 --> 00:53:17,700
Let me guess.

598
00:53:17,701 --> 00:53:20,670
Five foot seven, maybe eight.

599
00:53:20,671 --> 00:53:24,272
Brown eyes and dark hair.

600
00:53:24,273 --> 00:53:27,385
A little skinny, you always liked them unfed.
Am I close?

601
00:53:28,478 --> 00:53:32,516
- Hey, partner, am I close?
- Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty close.

602
00:53:32,517 --> 00:53:36,418
So then, things are going well, I take it.
Life panning out just like you planned?

603
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:39,523
- Look, Vince, what happened...
- Let's not go there, Jimbo.

604
00:53:39,524 --> 00:53:42,392
Let's not trip down memory lane.
I'm trying to keep cool here.

605
00:53:42,393 --> 00:53:45,395
Got my shirt off,
just trying to stay cool, baby.

606
00:53:45,396 --> 00:53:47,096
What? Did you want to try
stitching up old wounds?

607
00:53:47,097 --> 00:53:48,197
Is that why you came here?

608
00:53:48,198 --> 00:53:50,734
You just got out of prison, Vince.
Think about that.

609
00:53:50,735 --> 00:53:54,072
- You threatening me, Jimmy?
- Just stating a simple fact.

610
00:53:54,073 --> 00:53:57,175
Hey, fact is, you broke into my place.

611
00:53:57,176 --> 00:53:59,976
Listen, why don't we just keep going
our separate ways, okay?

612
00:53:59,977 --> 00:54:02,212
Hey, you came looking for me, remember?

613
00:54:02,213 --> 00:54:04,182
What the fuck
you trying to pull here, Jimmy?

614
00:54:04,183 --> 00:54:07,018
You're really starting
to fucking heat me up here.

615
00:54:07,019 --> 00:54:08,491
Vince?

616
00:54:16,562 --> 00:54:17,966
Deej?

617
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,906
Deej?

618
00:54:27,473 --> 00:54:28,912
Deej?

619
00:54:30,442 --> 00:54:32,943
- What the hell are you doing?
- Did you open that window?

620
00:54:32,944 --> 00:54:35,948
- Yeah, I opened the damn window.
- Don't open anything.

621
00:54:35,949 --> 00:54:38,050
It's like a tomb in here! I can't breathe!

622
00:54:38,051 --> 00:54:40,586
People get slaughtered in their beds,
for Christ sakes.

623
00:54:40,587 --> 00:54:44,494
- What are you doing?
- I'm just taking care of this place.

624
00:54:44,890 --> 00:54:48,105
I have to get up in four hours, Jimmy.

625
00:54:48,495 --> 00:54:49,968
Fuck!

626
00:54:54,901 --> 00:54:57,602
That's quite a sheet on your friend here.

627
00:54:57,603 --> 00:55:01,041
So, this guy starts calling you out
of the clear blue, huh?

628
00:55:01,042 --> 00:55:04,109
- After what?
- About seven years.

629
00:55:04,110 --> 00:55:09,018
Must have been some falling out.
Any idea why he'd contact you?

630
00:55:09,417 --> 00:55:11,650
No. No. No.
But I thought his mom might know.

631
00:55:11,651 --> 00:55:13,018
So I went and saw her...

632
00:55:13,019 --> 00:55:16,321
Well, wait a second.
You went to see his mother?

633
00:55:16,323 --> 00:55:19,191
- Yeah, well, you know...
- Well, then you went looking for him.

634
00:55:19,192 --> 00:55:20,292
No, no, no. I heard he was in town...

635
00:55:20,293 --> 00:55:22,829
He must have assumed
that you wanted to get in touch.

636
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:24,531
- No.
- Wait.

637
00:55:24,532 --> 00:55:27,332
Has this man actually made threats?

638
00:55:27,334 --> 00:55:30,969
- It's more about what he's implying.
- Yeah, implying.

639
00:55:30,971 --> 00:55:34,808
Well, since he's got a history,
I'll give a call down to his PO

640
00:55:34,809 --> 00:55:36,910
and make sure they have an eye on him.

641
00:55:36,911 --> 00:55:38,945
That's all I can do.

642
00:55:38,946 --> 00:55:43,651
This guy had a pretty serious drug habit.
And I think he may be using again.

643
00:55:43,652 --> 00:55:46,364
Do you have any evidence of that?

644
00:55:53,095 --> 00:55:56,262
- Will you just hold on to it, in case?
- In case what?

645
00:55:56,264 --> 00:55:59,233
Yeah, your Honor, that's the guy that
shot my friend. I don't even know this guy.

646
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:01,635
I told you, we ran a business together.
It turned to shit.

647
00:56:01,636 --> 00:56:04,171
- What kind of business?
- A vending business. A vending business.

648
00:56:04,172 --> 00:56:06,172
We routed stuff from an outfit in Mexico.

649
00:56:06,173 --> 00:56:07,575
- I mean, it was sweet.
- In Mexico?

650
00:56:07,576 --> 00:56:10,344
- The cash was great.
- Oh, what, were you laundering money?

651
00:56:10,345 --> 00:56:11,646
Well, the feds showed up.

652
00:56:11,647 --> 00:56:14,649
Oh, the feds showed up.
That's a minor detail.

653
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:17,192
Now six hours they...

654
00:56:17,586 --> 00:56:21,123
Anyway, the guy said that
Vince laid it all out for him.

655
00:56:21,124 --> 00:56:23,624
He suggested I do the same thing.

656
00:56:23,625 --> 00:56:25,530
Did you do time?

657
00:56:26,461 --> 00:56:28,639
Vince got three years.

658
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:31,767
The guy's a stupid fuck, you know.

659
00:56:31,768 --> 00:56:33,835
He could have been out in a year
with good behavior.

660
00:56:33,837 --> 00:56:37,516
You know, he goes off to prison
grinning like it's a joke.

661
00:56:37,607 --> 00:56:39,107
Fuck him.

662
00:56:39,108 --> 00:56:40,608
Yeah, fuck him. You're right.

663
00:56:40,609 --> 00:56:43,111
He's got a gun,
he's got a junk kit under his bed. Exactly.

664
00:56:43,112 --> 00:56:44,913
Fuck him. End this. Get this out of your life.

665
00:56:44,914 --> 00:56:49,061
You don't need this stuff, I'm telling you.
Walk away from it.

666
00:56:52,589 --> 00:56:57,862
You know, back in '86, I got nailed
for shoplifting a six-pack.

667
00:56:58,562 --> 00:56:59,962
What?

668
00:56:59,963 --> 00:57:04,473
I've gone down the criminal road.
I've been with you there, brother.

669
00:57:05,669 --> 00:57:07,506
I'm going home.

670
00:57:50,081 --> 00:57:51,588
Jimmy!

671
00:57:53,151 --> 00:57:56,763
- What do you want?
- Hey, take it easy. It's just me.

672
00:57:59,257 --> 00:58:01,095
Peace offering.

673
00:58:01,427 --> 00:58:03,360
I thought we'd... You know...

674
00:58:03,361 --> 00:58:04,662
Not for me.

675
00:58:04,663 --> 00:58:06,798
Look, I'm an asshole, okay?

676
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:08,566
I do stupid shit, man.

677
00:58:08,567 --> 00:58:12,007
My wife,
she always sets me straight later on.

678
00:58:12,338 --> 00:58:15,518
Come on, what do you say?
No hard feelings?

679
00:58:17,844 --> 00:58:19,283
Cool.

680
00:58:19,812 --> 00:58:23,415
Listen, I'm trying to get back
on the straight and narrow, you know?

681
00:58:23,416 --> 00:58:25,286
For my family.

682
00:58:26,219 --> 00:58:28,295
You know how it is.

683
00:58:30,456 --> 00:58:32,691
I just want to apologize, all right?

684
00:58:32,692 --> 00:58:35,694
I mean, doing the whole target prank thing,
I mean, it was a stupid joke.

685
00:58:35,695 --> 00:58:38,203
And I shouldn't have done it.

686
00:58:39,966 --> 00:58:42,268
- What?
- The target prank.

687
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:44,742
I really do apologize, man.

688
00:58:51,177 --> 00:58:53,981
Jimmy, I'm sorry, man.

689
00:58:56,083 --> 00:58:58,125
Jimmy, are we cool?

690
00:58:59,319 --> 00:59:02,789
Hey, Jimbo.
You're probably out golfing with the guys.

691
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,660
Catch you later.

692
00:59:05,726 --> 00:59:08,361
Hey, they say it's gonna
fucking snow down here this year.

693
00:59:08,362 --> 00:59:10,471
Can you believe that?

694
00:59:12,566 --> 00:59:13,733
Hear that?

695
00:59:13,734 --> 00:59:16,303
I'm pissing and pulling at the same time.

696
00:59:16,304 --> 00:59:18,847
What they call ambidextrous.

697
00:59:23,044 --> 00:59:25,279
You're not ignoring me, are you partner?

698
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:28,415
After all that initiative you took
looking me up.

699
00:59:28,416 --> 00:59:31,664
Amigos till the end. Remember that one?

700
00:59:49,104 --> 00:59:52,716
You just getting in?
Man, those hours will kill you.

701
00:59:53,643 --> 00:59:57,746
So, how are the wheels of commerce
turning today?

702
00:59:57,747 --> 00:59:59,246
Not too bad.

703
00:59:59,247 --> 01:00:01,494
I played hooky myself.

704
01:00:01,751 --> 01:00:04,497
Been lying here, just reminiscing.

705
01:00:05,154 --> 01:00:06,833
Hey, Vince,

706
01:00:08,057 --> 01:00:10,792
I want to apologize for
coming at you the way I did.

707
01:00:10,793 --> 01:00:12,661
That right, Jimmy?

708
01:00:12,662 --> 01:00:15,876
Yeah. Someone pulled a prank.
I overreacted.

709
01:00:16,065 --> 01:00:18,701
Jumped to some crazy conclusions.

710
01:00:18,702 --> 01:00:21,949
Like, who do I know
who's a convicted felon?

711
01:00:23,172 --> 01:00:24,645
Yeah.

712
01:00:25,074 --> 01:00:26,274
That's okay.

713
01:00:26,275 --> 01:00:28,977
They briefed us on this kind of thing
in the release program.

714
01:00:28,978 --> 01:00:31,380
A con's past is like quick sand.

715
01:00:31,381 --> 01:00:35,117
The harder you try to pull yourself out,
the deeper you sink.

716
01:00:35,118 --> 01:00:37,386
Well, I'm sorry, Vince.

717
01:00:37,387 --> 01:00:41,035
In the system they preach responsibility.

718
01:00:41,593 --> 01:00:45,363
You know, owning up to your own crimes.
Crucial step.

719
01:00:47,831 --> 01:00:50,933
Most of the guys in the joint though,
wax fucking epic on how they got framed.

720
01:00:50,934 --> 01:00:54,216
How so and so did it. Major fricking denial.

721
01:00:54,838 --> 01:00:57,984
Now those guys, there's no hope for them.

722
01:01:00,110 --> 01:01:01,844
You there?

723
01:01:01,845 --> 01:01:03,847
Yeah, I'm listening.

724
01:01:03,848 --> 01:01:07,220
I figured you came back
to take responsibility.

725
01:01:08,585 --> 01:01:10,763
I'm not sure I follow.

726
01:01:11,256 --> 01:01:15,734
I need to hear you say it, partner.
What went down in Oklahoma City.

727
01:01:16,262 --> 01:01:19,770
- Vincent.
- Say it, Jimmy. For both of us.

728
01:01:20,365 --> 01:01:22,499
I didn't sell you out.

729
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,867
See what I'm saying?

730
01:01:23,868 --> 01:01:26,003
Till we fix this,
we'll be stuck at this moment.

731
01:01:26,004 --> 01:01:29,406
Hey, listen, you had a chance to save
yourself, remember?

732
01:01:29,407 --> 01:01:31,341
But you chose to walk
the fucking gang plank.

733
01:01:31,342 --> 01:01:33,510
- With no help from me.
- You really disappoint me.

734
01:01:33,511 --> 01:01:35,979
So I am not taking responsibility
for your fucked up life. Okay?

735
01:01:35,980 --> 01:01:37,982
You got it all figured out. Don't you, Jimmy?

736
01:01:37,983 --> 01:01:40,919
You ever lose an hour's sleep
your whole life?

737
01:01:40,920 --> 01:01:42,352
- Face to face.
- I tell you, man, this is harassment.

738
01:01:42,353 --> 01:01:43,987
You look me in the eye
and tell me that you didn't...

739
01:01:43,988 --> 01:01:46,024
- And if it doesn't stop...
- What? What, are you gonna talk?

740
01:01:46,025 --> 01:01:48,826
- I will call your parole officer.
- Are you gonna call me?

741
01:01:48,828 --> 01:01:51,166
What will he do?

742
01:01:51,297 --> 01:01:53,578
Make you pee in a cup.

743
01:01:55,267 --> 01:01:59,573
Vince, I don't want this. Okay?
Let's just go our separate ways.

744
01:02:00,406 --> 01:02:02,711
Oh, I don't know, Jimmy.

745
01:02:03,409 --> 01:02:06,452
Smells kind of like a situation to me.

746
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:17,523
Coming up on 4:00,
time for your local weather.

747
01:02:17,524 --> 01:02:20,826
Well, all you desert rats,
get those skis waxed up.

748
01:02:20,827 --> 01:02:24,164
The heavy snows are blanketing
the Colorado Rockies

749
01:02:24,165 --> 01:02:26,632
and are heading south
towards the Duke City.

750
01:02:26,633 --> 01:02:30,279
I was saving all these
for the right occasions.

751
01:02:31,638 --> 01:02:36,244
I guess there were plenty.
Just didn't seem so at the time.

752
01:02:36,245 --> 01:02:42,188
- Maggie, I'm a little worried about Vincent.
- Oh, he's doing just fine.

753
01:02:42,517 --> 01:02:44,650
I talked to him on the phone last night,

754
01:02:44,651 --> 01:02:49,289
and kind of got the impression
he's thinking about

755
01:02:49,290 --> 01:02:51,832
maybe doing something stupid.

756
01:02:55,463 --> 01:02:57,106
Like what?

757
01:02:57,498 --> 01:03:00,967
Well, I just think maybe if you called
him and talked some sense...

758
01:03:00,968 --> 01:03:03,909
- I can't call him, Jimmy.
- Why is that?

759
01:03:04,539 --> 01:03:09,380
He's gone to Cimarron
with his parole program.

760
01:03:09,511 --> 01:03:10,950
Yeah.

761
01:03:11,281 --> 01:03:15,995
They're digging ditches
for those flood victims.

762
01:03:16,485 --> 01:03:19,120
Oh, ain't that sweet of him?

763
01:03:19,121 --> 01:03:24,458
Damn, I wish I'd been awake
when he left the message.

764
01:03:24,459 --> 01:03:26,467
Said he loved me.

765
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:30,771
Vincent don't say that much.

766
01:03:33,403 --> 01:03:35,876
Getting real cold out there.

767
01:03:36,705 --> 01:03:38,952
I better go. Thanks.

768
01:03:39,174 --> 01:03:40,977
Jimmy, here.

769
01:03:45,915 --> 01:03:48,560
Don't wait too long to open it.

770
01:04:18,816 --> 01:04:21,223
How's this for a situation?

771
01:04:28,892 --> 01:04:30,527
What am I supposed to think?
You're living your life

772
01:04:30,528 --> 01:04:32,932
by what a fortune teller said.

773
01:04:33,297 --> 01:04:36,299
Seems McClure failed to report
into his parole officer,

774
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:40,403
but with his type, this is fairly routine.
He's probably off on a bender somewhere.

775
01:04:40,404 --> 01:04:42,073
So, you're not doing a fucking thing

776
01:04:42,074 --> 01:04:44,320
until he comes here
and sticks a bullet in me, is that right?

777
01:04:44,709 --> 01:04:47,844
Sir, there's no indication
he intends to cross state lines

778
01:04:47,845 --> 01:04:48,945
or do you any harm.

779
01:04:48,946 --> 01:04:51,681
Now, this is a routine situation
and we're checking into it.

780
01:04:51,682 --> 01:04:52,950
Routine what?

781
01:04:52,951 --> 01:04:54,685
He's coming here.
What the fuck's it gonna take?

782
01:04:54,686 --> 01:04:57,263
Mr. Starks,
if you'd like to talk to a counselor...

783
01:04:58,522 --> 01:05:02,058
I just want you to go in there by yourself
and tell the guy you want a reading. Okay?

784
01:05:02,059 --> 01:05:04,496
It's easy. Just ask about the future.

785
01:05:04,497 --> 01:05:08,165
You know? Anything to do with us.
Marriage, kids, whatever.

786
01:05:08,166 --> 01:05:10,834
Marriage and kids.
That's... Used to make you...

787
01:05:10,835 --> 01:05:12,603
If he says something's gonna happen to me,
don't freak out.

788
01:05:12,604 --> 01:05:13,704
Just ask him what it is.

789
01:05:13,705 --> 01:05:15,874
But the fucker has a problem answering
a direct question.

790
01:05:15,875 --> 01:05:19,021
So you might have to lay on the tears or...

791
01:05:19,244 --> 01:05:21,650
- Okay?
- Yeah.

792
01:05:28,154 --> 01:05:32,267
Hey, the guy in the silver camper.
You know where he went?

793
01:05:51,045 --> 01:05:52,846
Well, look who's back. The jukebox kid.

794
01:05:52,847 --> 01:05:55,547
Hey, the fortune guy,
do you know where he went?

795
01:05:55,548 --> 01:05:57,382
You know, I wanted to talk to you
about that Wurlitzer.

796
01:05:57,383 --> 01:06:00,893
- I think we can cut a deal.
- You know where he is?

797
01:06:01,089 --> 01:06:02,689
He comes and goes a lot.

798
01:06:02,690 --> 01:06:06,425
Hey, Marcie, wasn't someone else in here
inquiring about the old man?

799
01:06:06,426 --> 01:06:09,595
Yeah. He was chatting on about
fishing at Abiquiu Lake.

800
01:06:09,596 --> 01:06:11,129
Guess it's good this time of year.

801
01:06:11,130 --> 01:06:14,801
- Yeah. Okay.
- Hey, listen, about that Wurlitzer.

802
01:06:14,802 --> 01:06:17,412
We gonna cut a deal or what?

803
01:06:51,540 --> 01:06:53,974
Abiquiu is in three hours.
Let's just get a hotel.

804
01:06:53,975 --> 01:06:57,411
This fucker's been on our ass
since Espanola. You notice that?

805
01:06:57,412 --> 01:07:00,059
Vince could be anywhere by now.

806
01:07:00,383 --> 01:07:03,061
- Just let him pass.
- Shit.

807
01:07:04,119 --> 01:07:06,654
Where the fuck did you get that?
Put that thing away.

808
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:10,336
- Just get down. Get down.
- Put the fucking gun away.

809
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:24,744
That's classic, Jimmy.

810
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:30,052
What are you doing?

811
01:07:34,184 --> 01:07:37,693
The old man said I was safe
until the first snow.

812
01:07:42,225 --> 01:07:45,064
What the fuck are you talking about?

813
01:07:47,264 --> 01:07:48,736
Jimmy?

814
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:57,280
Do what you gotta do. I'm going home.

815
01:08:49,894 --> 01:08:51,641
Mr. Starks.

816
01:08:53,332 --> 01:08:57,012
- Do you fish?
- Some fucking gift you've got.

817
01:08:59,838 --> 01:09:02,244
You wanna tell me about it?

818
01:09:02,674 --> 01:09:06,082
Because I don't know
what the fuck's going on.

819
01:09:08,382 --> 01:09:10,524
You wanna talk to me?

820
01:09:10,916 --> 01:09:14,097
- Nothing I say will matter.
- Oh, it might.

821
01:09:16,623 --> 01:09:19,699
I won't use this. All right?

822
01:09:22,895 --> 01:09:25,699
You shouldn't have fucking told me.

823
01:09:26,568 --> 01:09:29,769
If you could try to see it as a blessing.

824
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:31,846
Oh, yeah, a blessing.

825
01:09:32,639 --> 01:09:37,217
Think of those who never had a chance to...

826
01:09:37,878 --> 01:09:40,125
To put things in order.

827
01:09:40,747 --> 01:09:42,618
To say goodbye.

828
01:09:45,519 --> 01:09:47,197
Fuck that.

829
01:09:56,197 --> 01:09:59,774
I got a friend who thinks
that I screwed him over.

830
01:10:01,636 --> 01:10:04,214
Now, if I knew what was coming,

831
01:10:04,539 --> 01:10:07,709
if I knew what he was gonna do
then I'd get to stop him.

832
01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:10,080
So I want you to tell me.

833
01:10:15,651 --> 01:10:19,990
Your fate lies on whatever road you take,

834
01:10:20,954 --> 01:10:23,735
even if you choose to run from it.

835
01:10:28,964 --> 01:10:31,836
I'm not just gonna lie down and die.

836
01:10:32,734 --> 01:10:35,277
I don't give a shit who's decided for me.

837
01:10:40,609 --> 01:10:42,254
Oh, my God.

838
01:10:47,550 --> 01:10:49,489
- Sir?
- Hey!

839
01:11:04,701 --> 01:11:06,601
Clear skies in downtown Duke City,

840
01:11:06,602 --> 01:11:09,003
despite some scattered flurries
earlier in the week.

841
01:11:09,004 --> 01:11:11,373
But don't put away the skis just yet.

842
01:11:11,374 --> 01:11:14,044
A massive cold front is building
north of the Sandia's,

843
01:11:14,045 --> 01:11:18,555
which could mean up to 10 inches
of the white stuff by this weekend.

844
01:11:18,782 --> 01:11:20,815
You left Deirdre
on the side of the fucking highway.

845
01:11:20,816 --> 01:11:22,419
Does that sound like
rational behavior to you?

846
01:11:22,420 --> 01:11:24,320
Same thing I told you this morning.

847
01:11:24,321 --> 01:11:28,824
He was spotted on a security camera
two days ago stealing a vehicle.

848
01:11:28,825 --> 01:11:31,060
- An APB's going out. He can't get far.
- What? What?

849
01:11:31,061 --> 01:11:32,696
Rumor mill's working overtime, Jimmy.

850
01:11:32,697 --> 01:11:35,265
We don't see you in here
for three days and people start talking.

851
01:11:35,266 --> 01:11:38,234
Mr. Starks, he was last spotted near El Paso.

852
01:11:38,235 --> 01:11:41,470
So basically, nobody's got a fucking clue
where he is or where he's going?

853
01:11:41,471 --> 01:11:43,907
Now those folks down there are handling it.
And I'd appreciate...

854
01:11:43,908 --> 01:11:45,675
I'm done with your bullshit, Jimmy.
I've had it.

855
01:11:45,676 --> 01:11:48,617
I'm not covering for your ass anymore.

856
01:11:58,724 --> 01:12:00,491
Hey, this is Deirdre.

857
01:12:00,492 --> 01:12:03,171
If you don't know what to do,
I can't help you.

858
01:13:04,525 --> 01:13:07,067
Hey! Is there a problem in there?

859
01:13:08,362 --> 01:13:10,802
I just fell over. It's okay.

860
01:13:33,321 --> 01:13:35,721
I need to hear you say it, partner.

861
01:13:35,722 --> 01:13:38,367
What went down in Oklahoma City.

862
01:13:39,860 --> 01:13:42,404
Say it, Jimmy. For both of us.

863
01:13:44,866 --> 01:13:46,200
See what I'm saying?

864
01:13:46,201 --> 01:13:49,778
Till we fix this,
we'll be stuck at this moment.

865
01:14:43,793 --> 01:14:48,406
Your fate lies on whatever road you take,

866
01:14:49,332 --> 01:14:52,307
even if you choose to run from it.

867
01:17:29,698 --> 01:17:32,299
Jesus, Jimmy, where you been hiding?

868
01:17:32,300 --> 01:17:36,003
- Got the feeling you were avoiding me.
- No. I'm right here, buddy.

869
01:17:36,004 --> 01:17:40,651
Well, shit, the plan's all in tatters now.
Because of your little vanishing act.

870
01:17:41,010 --> 01:17:42,911
What plan's that?

871
01:17:42,912 --> 01:17:45,846
I thought you were up for a little reunion
at the old depot.

872
01:17:45,847 --> 01:17:48,390
Have a few laughs. Reminisce.

873
01:17:50,785 --> 01:17:52,497
Sure. Okay.

874
01:17:54,123 --> 01:17:57,859
You're not setting me up, are you, Jimmy?
I'm counting on you not to fuck this up.

875
01:17:57,860 --> 01:17:59,861
No, no, no. I'll be there.

876
01:17:59,862 --> 01:18:03,702
Good. Tomorrow night.
We're gonna get things squared up.

877
01:18:05,568 --> 01:18:07,802
I'm real glad you're coming.

878
01:18:07,803 --> 01:18:09,208
Yeah.

879
01:18:43,373 --> 01:18:45,916
Jimmy. Good to have you back.

880
01:18:47,544 --> 01:18:49,011
Roy.

881
01:18:49,012 --> 01:18:50,986
Everything kosher?

882
01:18:51,883 --> 01:18:53,083
Yeah.

883
01:18:53,084 --> 01:18:56,086
Cash for those jukeboxes
is sitting in North and Wells,

884
01:18:56,087 --> 01:18:58,231
waiting on your lazy ass.

885
01:18:58,489 --> 01:19:02,459
So I need half of it wired into this account
and the rest in cash.

886
01:19:02,460 --> 01:19:05,435
Let's roll. Let's make us some money.

887
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:07,598
You sure you want to be
hefting that much around? I mean...

888
01:19:07,599 --> 01:19:09,601
- Yeah.
- We could wire it, no problem.

889
01:19:09,602 --> 01:19:12,169
No, it's gotta be cash.
These guys are ex-gamblers.

890
01:19:12,170 --> 01:19:14,246
They don't trust us desert rats.

891
01:19:18,977 --> 01:19:22,746
What do you want?
You gonna press charges now, too?

892
01:19:22,747 --> 01:19:26,751
Wurlitzer’s. 1015s.
Most popular jukebox model in history.

893
01:19:26,752 --> 01:19:29,587
I got 50 grand worth of them
paid for sitting in a warehouse in Phoenix.

894
01:19:29,588 --> 01:19:32,871
Got the leads right here. What do you say?

895
01:19:34,493 --> 01:19:36,694
I thought this was your big ticket?

896
01:19:36,695 --> 01:19:38,696
Well, you know, I'm looking for a partner.

897
01:19:38,697 --> 01:19:41,205
Someone to manage it for me.

898
01:19:41,366 --> 01:19:43,510
Wanna think about it?

899
01:19:46,005 --> 01:19:48,114
You're crazy, gringo.

900
01:19:50,976 --> 01:19:53,311
Yeah. Yeah, I'll think about it.

901
01:19:53,312 --> 01:19:57,187
Your name's already on the account.
You'll do great.

902
01:20:13,733 --> 01:20:16,335
Jimbalaya, where the hell you been, man?

903
01:20:16,336 --> 01:20:19,505
Oh, you know. Little touch of lazy valve.
Nothing serious.

904
01:20:19,506 --> 01:20:21,006
Give me the usual.

905
01:20:21,007 --> 01:20:24,448
One for my shoplifter friend
down the end, here.

906
01:20:33,019 --> 01:20:36,496
- Good to see you.
- Likewise.

907
01:20:37,858 --> 01:20:40,627
- I'm sorry I been such a...
- Asshole?

908
01:20:40,628 --> 01:20:42,432
Asshole. Yeah.

909
01:20:52,807 --> 01:20:55,349
You seem different.

910
01:21:00,948 --> 01:21:05,289
Hey, you heard about those weather guys
that fly into hurricanes?

911
01:21:05,953 --> 01:21:11,671
And they get to the center
and it's suddenly all real calm and still?

912
01:21:12,594 --> 01:21:14,840
This where you're at?

913
01:21:15,398 --> 01:21:16,905
Yeah.

914
01:21:18,767 --> 01:21:23,483
- Means they're still in the storm, you know?
- Well, it's a good place to be, man.

915
01:21:28,545 --> 01:21:31,813
Shit. No, you get nirvana, I get Espanola.

916
01:21:31,814 --> 01:21:35,550
Hey, hey you wanna take a drive with me?
Come on, me and you.

917
01:21:35,551 --> 01:21:37,285
- Cruising on the highway?
- No.

918
01:21:37,286 --> 01:21:38,387
- No?
- You take it.

919
01:21:38,388 --> 01:21:40,792
No? No desire, right?

920
01:21:41,557 --> 01:21:44,998
- I'll see you tomorrow?
- Yeah.

921
01:21:47,163 --> 01:21:51,436
- Hey, Sam, I'll clear out my tab.
- It's not the end of the month.

922
01:21:56,206 --> 01:21:58,440
You're an amazing bartender,
you know that?

923
01:21:58,441 --> 01:21:59,675
What?

924
01:21:59,676 --> 01:22:02,611
I love your work, man. Just wanted to say it.

925
01:22:02,612 --> 01:22:05,256
Get the fuck out of here, Jimmy.

926
01:22:25,837 --> 01:22:29,607
- I guess you're back.
- Yeah. You could say that.

927
01:22:33,210 --> 01:22:35,650
I just came to get my stuff.

928
01:22:37,648 --> 01:22:41,016
My dad's sick again,

929
01:22:41,017 --> 01:22:43,855
so I thought I'd drive up there and...

930
01:22:47,259 --> 01:22:49,597
I'm glad you're okay.

931
01:23:13,585 --> 01:23:16,332
This feels like some great affair.

932
01:23:17,656 --> 01:23:21,667
You wanna go to Taos soon?
Take a look at the 10 acres?

933
01:23:24,297 --> 01:23:26,270
Are you serious?

934
01:23:26,565 --> 01:23:29,972
Yeah. I'm sick of this place.

935
01:23:33,274 --> 01:23:37,077
- Don't go to Denver.
- Just a few days.

936
01:23:37,677 --> 01:23:40,617
I'll be back before you know I'm gone.

937
01:23:45,886 --> 01:23:48,597
You surprise me sometimes, Jimmy.

938
01:23:53,593 --> 01:23:56,899
- Don't change your mind about Taos.
- I won't.

939
01:23:59,567 --> 01:24:01,506
Okay, I gotta go.

940
01:24:09,343 --> 01:24:11,623
It's gonna be okay, Dee.

941
01:26:37,029 --> 01:26:38,832
Hey, Vincent.

942
01:26:43,335 --> 01:26:46,548
You actually showed up without the cavalry.

943
01:26:46,638 --> 01:26:48,715
Proud of you, Jimmy.

944
01:26:50,443 --> 01:26:52,017
Sit down.

945
01:26:58,918 --> 01:27:00,390
You...

946
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:04,722
Remember that time
my old man took us here?

947
01:27:04,723 --> 01:27:07,058
Pretending we were gold prospectors?

948
01:27:07,059 --> 01:27:09,397
Yeah. That was a good day.

949
01:27:10,697 --> 01:27:13,945
Shit. Get all dressed up for me?

950
01:27:18,237 --> 01:27:20,883
I'd have cleaned myself up,

951
01:27:21,975 --> 01:27:24,518
but Four Seasons was all booked.

952
01:27:27,213 --> 01:27:29,014
Have a drink, Jimmy.

953
01:27:29,015 --> 01:27:30,982
Not too good to drink with me
these days, are you?

954
01:27:30,983 --> 01:27:32,286
Hey.

955
01:27:35,990 --> 01:27:38,463
Feels good to be back home.

956
01:27:41,961 --> 01:27:45,938
You know, I still consider you
my best friend even after everything.

957
01:27:47,134 --> 01:27:50,745
Friends like us,
that don't wear out like old tires.

958
01:27:53,006 --> 01:27:54,980
I used to imagine,

959
01:27:55,944 --> 01:27:58,812
you and me living next door to each other.

960
01:27:58,813 --> 01:28:02,562
Wives would be best friends,
kids would play together.

961
01:28:03,317 --> 01:28:06,565
Maybe even bring them here to pan for gold.

962
01:28:08,990 --> 01:28:11,863
Why'd you have to fuck all that up?

963
01:28:12,194 --> 01:28:14,928
Yeah. I wish I could tell you.

964
01:28:14,929 --> 01:28:18,432
I mean, what were we looking at?
What, a year a piece in Stillwater?

965
01:28:18,433 --> 01:28:21,773
We could have done that
on our fucking heads.

966
01:28:22,071 --> 01:28:25,472
Shared the same cell.
Told jokes in the mess hall.

967
01:28:25,473 --> 01:28:30,087
Dream up crazy shit for when we got out.
We would have been all right.

968
01:28:31,046 --> 01:28:34,516
I suppose, you know,
that's none of your concern.

969
01:28:34,517 --> 01:28:38,424
Not your responsibility, my...
My fucked up life.

970
01:28:42,426 --> 01:28:44,292
Go on, Jimmy.

971
01:28:44,293 --> 01:28:46,661
Give me one of your lines.

972
01:28:46,662 --> 01:28:48,235
Sell me.

973
01:29:09,619 --> 01:29:12,058
I did sell you out, Vincent.

974
01:29:17,995 --> 01:29:21,869
I just wanted to get out of that
fucking room, you know?

975
01:29:23,366 --> 01:29:27,069
It was so fucking hot. I just wanted water...

976
01:29:27,070 --> 01:29:29,573
Did you ever think
of telling the truth, Jimmy?

977
01:29:29,574 --> 01:29:31,979
In your whole fucking life?

978
01:29:33,111 --> 01:29:35,277
No elaborate money laundering scheme.

979
01:29:35,278 --> 01:29:38,515
No, just two stupid gringos
in over their heads!

980
01:29:38,516 --> 01:29:42,890
You could have told them that
after you drank your fucking water!

981
01:29:43,388 --> 01:29:45,565
I was fucking scared.

982
01:29:49,894 --> 01:29:53,297
I've read it so many fucking times,
I got it memorized.

983
01:29:53,298 --> 01:29:55,767
I'm gonna hire a lawyer, Vincenzo. The best.

984
01:29:55,768 --> 01:29:59,468
I'm gonna get you out of that hell hole.
What happened to the plan?

985
01:29:59,469 --> 01:30:01,775
No looking back. That it?

986
01:30:02,841 --> 01:30:07,477
A man sinking in quick sand,
you don't kick him in the teeth, Jimmy!

987
01:30:07,478 --> 01:30:10,692
You grab his hand and try to pull him out!

988
01:30:10,815 --> 01:30:11,915
It's like my own mother.

989
01:30:11,916 --> 01:30:13,718
You know, I go there...
I show up there two days ago,

990
01:30:13,719 --> 01:30:15,286
and my head's hurting
and all I want to do is sleep.

991
01:30:15,287 --> 01:30:17,898
And she goes and calls my PO!

992
01:30:19,291 --> 01:30:21,366
She's dying, Vince.

993
01:30:22,026 --> 01:30:25,096
- You shut your fucking mouth!
- She wants you to...

994
01:30:25,097 --> 01:30:26,497
She wants you to go straight.

995
01:30:26,498 --> 01:30:28,266
My mother ain't fucking dying!

996
01:30:28,267 --> 01:30:32,913
Vince, Vince. I got 50 grand in the car.
I got 50 grand in the car for you.

997
01:30:35,174 --> 01:30:37,643
We'll drive out of here. Yeah?

998
01:30:37,644 --> 01:30:39,545
I'll take you wherever you wanna go.

999
01:30:39,546 --> 01:30:40,713
Always a salesman, eh, Jimmy?

1000
01:30:40,714 --> 01:30:43,915
What, still trying to negotiate
your way out of a fucking scrape?

1001
01:30:43,916 --> 01:30:46,254
I'm not. I'm not, man.

1002
01:30:48,955 --> 01:30:53,058
Fifty grand. That's like tossing a Band Aid
to a guy who's fucking bleeding to death.

1003
01:30:53,059 --> 01:30:55,464
It's not a bribe, Vincent.

1004
01:30:56,462 --> 01:30:58,470
I wanna help you.

1005
01:31:03,136 --> 01:31:05,781
It's too late. I'm all bled out.

1006
01:31:08,240 --> 01:31:11,176
I've been trying, you know,
make things right for so fucking long.

1007
01:31:11,177 --> 01:31:13,780
It's been eating me up inside.

1008
01:31:13,781 --> 01:31:19,151
And then you show up out of nowhere
and it's like everything fell into place, man.

1009
01:31:19,152 --> 01:31:21,696
It's like it was all arranged.

1010
01:31:24,258 --> 01:31:25,868
Stand up.

1011
01:31:27,194 --> 01:31:28,769
Stand up!

1012
01:31:30,730 --> 01:31:32,374
Come here.

1013
01:31:38,674 --> 01:31:40,681
I had this

1014
01:31:41,541 --> 01:31:43,343
real prick for a cellmate once.

1015
01:31:43,344 --> 01:31:45,546
Rhodes was the guy's name.

1016
01:31:45,547 --> 01:31:48,852
And one time, after dinner,

1017
01:31:49,418 --> 01:31:52,986
Rhodes head butts his guard, grabs his. 38,

1018
01:31:52,987 --> 01:31:54,888
just like this one here,

1019
01:31:54,889 --> 01:31:57,558
and he's got the guard
pressed up right against him,

1020
01:31:57,559 --> 01:31:58,726
just like us right now,

1021
01:31:58,727 --> 01:32:00,828
and he's screaming in the fucking mess hall,

1022
01:32:00,829 --> 01:32:03,372
"Back! Back!

1023
01:32:03,899 --> 01:32:07,580
"I'm walking out of here or this pig gets it!"

1024
01:32:09,706 --> 01:32:13,010
So finally, the guards charge him.

1025
01:32:13,308 --> 01:32:16,249
And old Rhodesy, he pulls the trigger,

1026
01:32:16,912 --> 01:32:20,649
and the bullet goes through
both their skulls.

1027
01:32:20,650 --> 01:32:24,194
Ends up in a fucking dinner tray
100 yards away.

1028
01:32:24,654 --> 01:32:27,457
Asshole blew his own brains out.

1029
01:32:30,560 --> 01:32:34,934
Don't! Don't move. Don't, don't. Get down.
Get on your knees.

1030
01:32:44,073 --> 01:32:45,683
Jesus Christ.

1031
01:32:48,679 --> 01:32:51,959
I'd love to thank you for the stuff, Jimbo.

1032
01:32:53,150 --> 01:32:55,454
Ain't what I had in mind.

1033
01:32:56,754 --> 01:33:00,023
Me and you, partner. Two birds, one stone.

1034
01:33:00,024 --> 01:33:04,397
Butch and Sundance, out in a blaze of glory.

1035
01:33:05,296 --> 01:33:06,362
Hey, Vince.

1036
01:33:06,363 --> 01:33:08,398
We're gonna be some team
in the next world, you know that?

1037
01:33:08,399 --> 01:33:10,633
- Un-fucking-stoppable!
- Don't do this. Don't do this.

1038
01:33:10,634 --> 01:33:13,802
But we gotta stick together
from now on, okay?

1039
01:33:13,803 --> 01:33:16,639
- Just get in the car.
- No, no, no, no. This is better.

1040
01:33:16,640 --> 01:33:19,943
I'm not up for your thing. Are you ready?

1041
01:33:19,944 --> 01:33:22,178
- Don't do this. Vince. Come on, Vince.
- Are you ready?

1042
01:33:22,179 --> 01:33:23,680
- Vincent, Vincent, come on.
- See you in the next world.

1043
01:33:23,681 --> 01:33:25,517
- Come on, buddy.
- Vincent!

1044
01:34:59,313 --> 01:35:01,581
Treacherous roads out there tonight, folks.

1045
01:35:01,582 --> 01:35:04,718
We could be looking at 10 inches
of the white stuff by morning.

1046
01:35:04,719 --> 01:35:08,388
Temperatures here in the high desert
beginning to drop into the low 20's.

1047
01:35:08,389 --> 01:35:11,258
So take my advice, all you desert rats.

1048
01:35:11,259 --> 01:35:15,061
Grab a bottle, grab your sweetie,
and stay indoors tonight.

1049
01:35:15,062 --> 01:35:18,132
This is the Lone Wolf coming to you
on Graveyard Radio.

1050
01:35:18,133 --> 01:35:21,277
Live from the lovely plains of Moriarty.

1051
01:35:59,075 --> 01:36:01,151
This road you're on,

1052
01:36:01,877 --> 01:36:04,421
you put yourself on this road,

1053
01:36:06,216 --> 01:36:08,360
on this exact night.

1054
01:36:10,620 --> 01:36:12,457
You chose this.

1055
01:36:14,958 --> 01:36:17,569
A man makes his destiny, right?

1056
01:36:19,963 --> 01:36:22,836
Nothing makes the gods laugh harder.

1057
01:36:47,591 --> 01:36:49,659
Last night the heavy snow
claimed its first victim

1058
01:36:49,660 --> 01:36:54,264
out on Highway 14 after a delivery truck
lost control on the icy road.

1059
01:36:54,265 --> 01:36:58,309
Instantly killing the driver of a northbound
vehicle in a head-on collision.

1060
01:36:58,435 --> 01:37:00,215
The dangerous roads have also...
