1
00:03:05,493 --> 00:03:06,911
Waiter!

2
00:03:17,088 --> 00:03:20,425
What's that? Oh, my god.

3
00:03:21,092 --> 00:03:22,510
Hi.

4
00:03:37,525 --> 00:03:39,610
Madam. Thank you.

5
00:03:52,623 --> 00:03:54,458
Hold on one second.

6
00:03:54,542 --> 00:03:56,043
Well, yes.

7
00:03:58,045 --> 00:04:00,047
Hold on one second. One second.

8
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:02,717
Hi. Sorry I'm late.

9
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,719
Cassie Jane, I'm the features
editor at the paper.

10
00:04:04,802 --> 00:04:06,888
We spoke on the phone earlier.
It's, um...

11
00:04:08,055 --> 00:04:09,056
Laura Quinn.

12
00:04:10,224 --> 00:04:11,893
Robin, go ahead.

13
00:04:13,311 --> 00:04:14,478
I got front page?

14
00:04:16,397 --> 00:04:17,732
Perfect. Thanks.

15
00:04:17,732 --> 00:04:18,733
Thanks, bye.

16
00:04:20,902 --> 00:04:24,488
Whoo! We should be careful
what we wish for. Hmm.

17
00:04:24,572 --> 00:04:27,909
Having it all at 25 cannot
be biologically correct.

18
00:04:27,992 --> 00:04:30,244
So, thank you
for contacting us.

19
00:04:30,328 --> 00:04:32,079
As you know, we're
running a series

20
00:04:32,163 --> 00:04:33,915
of features
called "Women Who Led."

21
00:04:33,915 --> 00:04:35,666
All about the everyday women

22
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,752
who back in the late fifties,
the early sixties,

23
00:04:37,752 --> 00:04:39,754
started breaking
the boundaries,

24
00:04:39,754 --> 00:04:42,089
really inventing
the modern woman.

25
00:04:42,089 --> 00:04:43,925
A lot of people who
turned up in our research

26
00:04:43,925 --> 00:04:45,843
turned out to be dead,
but you're...

27
00:04:48,804 --> 00:04:52,058
alive, so that's great.

28
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:55,019
I, um, I need
to paint a picture.

29
00:04:55,102 --> 00:04:59,065
You're hired by the London
Diamond Corporation.

30
00:04:59,106 --> 00:05:02,610
It's number one in the world.
It is the fifties.

31
00:05:02,652 --> 00:05:06,072
It's a fiercely
male-dominated environment.

32
00:05:06,113 --> 00:05:07,865
You take on the men.

33
00:05:07,949 --> 00:05:12,536
You battle your way up
and become... a manager.

34
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:14,622
Well, that's not going to
impress anyone these days,

35
00:05:14,622 --> 00:05:18,292
but you were the only female
manager that had ever existed

36
00:05:18,376 --> 00:05:22,046
in that company and I want
to know your story.

37
00:05:23,297 --> 00:05:25,049
You know, I haven't
set foot in this city

38
00:05:25,132 --> 00:05:27,093
as a free woman
in over 40 years.

39
00:05:28,427 --> 00:05:29,303
Really?

40
00:05:29,387 --> 00:05:30,805
It's changed.

41
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:48,656
It's an exceptional
piece, isn't it?

42
00:05:48,739 --> 00:05:53,911
168 carats, 58 facets,

43
00:05:53,994 --> 00:05:55,162
very rare.

44
00:06:01,669 --> 00:06:04,171
I stole it...

45
00:06:04,171 --> 00:06:06,090
from London Diamond.

46
00:06:16,434 --> 00:06:18,519
Good deal took place
at London Diamond.

47
00:06:18,602 --> 00:06:20,271
It may not be
in your notes.

48
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:25,025
You've been in prison.
That's where you've been.

49
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,044
Good morning,
gentlemen.

50
00:06:44,128 --> 00:06:45,880
Miss Quinn, good morning.

51
00:06:45,963 --> 00:06:47,214
Good morning,
Miss Quinn.

52
00:06:58,893 --> 00:06:59,810
Good morning,
Miss Quinn.

53
00:06:59,894 --> 00:07:00,895
Good morning, Mr. Hobbs.

54
00:07:03,147 --> 00:07:05,399
Aiming to beat
the sunrise, Miss Quinn?

55
00:07:05,482 --> 00:07:08,903
Literate, Henry.
Literate.

56
00:08:30,818 --> 00:08:33,904
No more blood for diamonds!

57
00:08:35,072 --> 00:08:37,074
I see our fan club
is assembled.

58
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,252
Murderer!

59
00:08:48,335 --> 00:08:49,920
Murderer!

60
00:08:53,507 --> 00:08:54,591
Good morning, Mr. Milton.

61
00:08:54,675 --> 00:08:55,843
Good morning,
Mr. Milton.

62
00:08:57,177 --> 00:08:58,429
Morning, gents.
Good morning.

63
00:09:02,266 --> 00:09:04,476
I'm sure by now
you're all aware...

64
00:09:04,518 --> 00:09:07,521
tensions reached a head
yesterday in Kimstad.

65
00:09:07,604 --> 00:09:08,522
What are
the final figures?

66
00:09:08,605 --> 00:09:10,524
What do you mean?
Dead? How many dead?

67
00:09:10,566 --> 00:09:11,608
A hundred, give or take,

68
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,693
most of them on our pay roll.

69
00:09:12,776 --> 00:09:14,111
It is a cock-up.

70
00:09:14,194 --> 00:09:16,822
Everyone is pointing
their fingers at us.

71
00:09:16,864 --> 00:09:18,699
Christ Almighty!

72
00:09:18,782 --> 00:09:21,618
The whole pissing South
African regime is our fault.

73
00:09:21,702 --> 00:09:23,370
What are the Soviets saying?

74
00:09:23,454 --> 00:09:25,622
I'm afraid the Russians
are leading the charge.

75
00:09:25,706 --> 00:09:27,249
They're pressing
for U.N. sanctions.

76
00:09:27,291 --> 00:09:28,625
They're going to war with us

77
00:09:28,709 --> 00:09:30,043
the week that we are
renewing their contracts.

78
00:09:30,127 --> 00:09:31,420
We don't need
the Russians.

79
00:09:31,462 --> 00:09:33,046
With respect, sir,

80
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,382
if the soviets broke away,
it would be disastrous.

81
00:09:35,382 --> 00:09:38,218
They could align
with Botswana,

82
00:09:38,218 --> 00:09:40,220
Sierra Leone,
or even Angola.

83
00:09:40,304 --> 00:09:42,222
Combined production
would exceed our own.

84
00:09:42,306 --> 00:09:44,725
We would no longer
control global supply.

85
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,643
The cartel collapses
and prices would free fall.

86
00:09:46,727 --> 00:09:48,145
The Russians are paid
well above market.

87
00:09:48,228 --> 00:09:49,646
They won't
break ranks.

88
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:53,233
In any case, officials from the
Soviet diamond trading organization

89
00:09:53,233 --> 00:09:55,068
are en route
as we speak.

90
00:09:55,068 --> 00:09:57,738
Precisely.
To end our relationship.

91
00:09:59,448 --> 00:10:01,700
Very well.

92
00:10:01,742 --> 00:10:03,744
Now we have two days.

93
00:10:03,785 --> 00:10:05,746
Two days to find
a solution.

94
00:10:07,247 --> 00:10:10,334
Wait, wait, uh, um...

95
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:12,711
one final item.

96
00:10:12,836 --> 00:10:14,755
I'd like you to join me
in congratulating

97
00:10:14,796 --> 00:10:17,257
our newest
Managing Director,

98
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:20,260
who, god willing, will keep
us afloat in Cape Town,

99
00:10:20,302 --> 00:10:22,095
Mr. Peter Boland.

100
00:10:22,095 --> 00:10:24,014
Congratulations.
Well done.

101
00:10:38,111 --> 00:10:39,947
I'm speechless.

102
00:10:39,947 --> 00:10:41,782
Boland over you?

103
00:10:41,782 --> 00:10:43,617
The old man
is losing his mind.

104
00:10:43,617 --> 00:10:45,327
No, he's
thinking straight.

105
00:10:45,369 --> 00:10:47,871
In addition to being
several years my senior,

106
00:10:47,955 --> 00:10:51,750
Boland's experience is far
better suited to the position.

107
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,961
Besides, they're doing
me a favor.

108
00:10:53,961 --> 00:10:57,965
Didn't you know cape town's
a furnace in the summer?

109
00:10:57,965 --> 00:11:00,968
Well, I hope that they've got
something better lined up for you.

110
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:22,322
"Lon Di subsidiaries worldwide, 1,223.

111
00:11:22,406 --> 00:11:25,158
"Female Managing Directors,

112
00:11:25,242 --> 00:11:26,410
"0."

113
00:11:41,508 --> 00:11:45,345
"Don't give up.

114
00:11:45,429 --> 00:11:49,766
"Work harder.

115
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:54,104
"You will win."

116
00:12:11,788 --> 00:12:14,541
You forgot again.

117
00:12:14,624 --> 00:12:16,209
Lunch?
Lunch?

118
00:12:16,293 --> 00:12:17,627
It's a holiday,
middle of the day,

119
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:20,881
people meet, unwind,
buy make-up, plot against men.

120
00:12:20,964 --> 00:12:21,882
Oh, it's all the rage.

121
00:12:21,965 --> 00:12:22,883
I'm so sorry.

122
00:12:22,966 --> 00:12:24,384
Look, it's one crisis
after another.

123
00:12:24,468 --> 00:12:25,635
Can we reschedule?

124
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:27,637
Tuesday it is,
but not with me,

125
00:12:27,721 --> 00:12:28,889
with Kenneth Pearson,

126
00:12:28,972 --> 00:12:30,724
a friend of mine that
would like to meet you.

127
00:12:30,807 --> 00:12:32,392
Judy, it's so kind,

128
00:12:32,476 --> 00:12:36,062
but I really don't like
the name Kenneth.

129
00:12:36,146 --> 00:12:38,231
Don't leave it
too long, Laura.

130
00:12:38,315 --> 00:12:40,567
There won't be
any plots left.

131
00:12:49,826 --> 00:12:52,245
Oh, working late again,
Miss Quinn?

132
00:12:54,915 --> 00:12:57,751
Always the first to arrive
and the last to leave.

133
00:12:59,669 --> 00:13:02,756
Your colleagues must value
your dedication.

134
00:13:04,257 --> 00:13:07,093
What's that bit from
the, uh, from the Bible?

135
00:13:07,177 --> 00:13:11,848
You know, "he who
is last shall be first

136
00:13:11,932 --> 00:13:14,935
"and he who is first
shall be last."

137
00:13:15,018 --> 00:13:16,102
Is that how it goes?

138
00:13:16,186 --> 00:13:17,437
Yeah.

139
00:13:17,437 --> 00:13:18,855
What a load of rubbish.

140
00:13:20,106 --> 00:13:23,193
We all know you
take what you desire.

141
00:13:23,276 --> 00:13:26,530
Fortune favors the bold.

142
00:13:29,616 --> 00:13:32,452
Take those South Africans,
for example.

143
00:13:32,536 --> 00:13:35,539
Do you think we should
hand them their freedom

144
00:13:35,622 --> 00:13:37,541
or let them seize it
for themselves?

145
00:13:37,624 --> 00:13:41,294
Well, that's an interesting
debate, but a dangerous one maybe.

146
00:13:41,294 --> 00:13:42,712
But for my money,

147
00:13:42,796 --> 00:13:45,131
I'd say things are never as
simple as they would seem.

148
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:47,550
I'm sure
you're right, Miss Quinn.

149
00:13:47,634 --> 00:13:49,052
You're the one with the suit.

150
00:13:50,303 --> 00:13:51,805
Good night.

151
00:13:53,473 --> 00:13:54,474
Good luck.

152
00:14:05,485 --> 00:14:07,570
Living dangerously,
Miss Quinn?

153
00:14:07,654 --> 00:14:10,657
Recklessly, Henry.
Recklessly.

154
00:15:25,398 --> 00:15:27,066
Something troubling you,
Miss Quinn?

155
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:28,902
The existing
Russian contract.

156
00:15:28,985 --> 00:15:31,488
I propose
we simply extend it.

157
00:15:32,739 --> 00:15:33,740
I'm sorry.
You've lost me.

158
00:15:33,823 --> 00:15:35,825
Was it not you that
suggested the Russians

159
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:37,994
were on their way
here to sever all ties?

160
00:15:38,077 --> 00:15:41,247
If we allow the soviets to publicly
disassociate with London Diamond,

161
00:15:41,247 --> 00:15:43,416
let them pound
the table at the U.N.,

162
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:46,586
denounce racist capitalism
and so on and so on,

163
00:15:46,586 --> 00:15:49,422
but secretly
we extend our contract

164
00:15:49,506 --> 00:15:52,425
and keep it a strictly
private matter,

165
00:15:52,509 --> 00:15:54,844
at least until the storm
has passed over.

166
00:15:54,928 --> 00:15:56,346
While they continue
to wholesale

167
00:15:56,429 --> 00:15:57,764
diamonds at
a magnificent price.

168
00:15:57,847 --> 00:15:59,682
That's not bad.
That's not bad at all.

169
00:16:02,602 --> 00:16:04,938
Who else have
you told about this?

170
00:16:04,938 --> 00:16:08,107
It's much better now
than it ever was.

171
00:16:08,107 --> 00:16:10,693
In such a short time.

172
00:16:10,777 --> 00:16:13,363
Laura, is that you?

173
00:16:13,446 --> 00:16:16,282
Harold Reynolds, good god.

174
00:16:16,366 --> 00:16:18,451
Gentlemen, this lady
is the cleverest person

175
00:16:18,535 --> 00:16:20,703
I've ever met,
and she's American.

176
00:16:20,787 --> 00:16:23,873
Ran circles around
the lot of us at Oxford.

177
00:16:23,957 --> 00:16:25,625
Of course I don't
talk to her anymore.

178
00:16:25,625 --> 00:16:27,710
She turned me down
for dinner three times.

179
00:16:27,794 --> 00:16:29,546
I was just
testing his resolve.

180
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:32,382
If he had tried one more
time, I would have said yes.

181
00:16:32,465 --> 00:16:34,300
I'm with allied banking
heading up syndications.

182
00:16:34,384 --> 00:16:36,302
We've just been sweating
over your accounts.

183
00:16:36,386 --> 00:16:38,137
A lot of ice down there.

184
00:16:38,221 --> 00:16:41,641
No doubt impressive, but
it's making people nervous.

185
00:16:41,641 --> 00:16:42,809
But now I know you're here,

186
00:16:42,892 --> 00:16:44,644
I can sleep a little easier.

187
00:16:44,727 --> 00:16:48,064
Um, unless of course you're
considering a career change,

188
00:16:48,147 --> 00:16:49,148
with allied banking,

189
00:16:49,232 --> 00:16:51,818
world domination
can also be arranged.

190
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:13,006
Earliest and brightest
as usual, Miss Quinn.

191
00:17:13,089 --> 00:17:14,590
Oh, I do my best, Henry.

192
00:17:15,675 --> 00:17:16,676
Thank you.

193
00:17:33,276 --> 00:17:35,695
No, you won't.

194
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,388
Miss Quinn.
Miss Quinn.

195
00:18:02,388 --> 00:18:03,723
Why don't we sit
in there?

196
00:18:03,723 --> 00:18:05,224
Mr. Hobbs?

197
00:18:05,308 --> 00:18:06,893
Yes.

198
00:18:06,976 --> 00:18:09,812
Mr. Hobbs, I'm flattered,

199
00:18:09,854 --> 00:18:11,814
but I'm... I'm... I'm
really not looking.

200
00:18:11,898 --> 00:18:13,107
Oh, please... please
don't panic, Miss Quinn.

201
00:18:13,232 --> 00:18:14,984
I'm... I'm a happily
married man.

202
00:18:15,068 --> 00:18:16,903
And I wouldn't be
so courageous.

203
00:18:16,903 --> 00:18:19,072
I... I have a proposal
to put to you.

204
00:18:19,155 --> 00:18:21,324
It's... it's a trifle.

205
00:18:21,407 --> 00:18:23,493
Just give me
five minutes. Please.

206
00:18:32,085 --> 00:18:34,253
Come and sit.

207
00:18:34,337 --> 00:18:35,922
It's something
I do to get sympathy.

208
00:18:36,005 --> 00:18:39,717
War wound. The Blitz.

209
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:43,179
My wife and I, we went
for some music at Wilton's.

210
00:18:43,221 --> 00:18:46,015
Very explosive performance.

211
00:18:46,098 --> 00:18:48,851
Anyway, we both
survived that one,

212
00:18:48,935 --> 00:18:52,438
only to find out that my wife
was living on borrowed time.

213
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:55,358
I thought you were
happily married?

214
00:18:55,441 --> 00:18:56,859
Oh, I am, Miss Quinn.

215
00:18:56,901 --> 00:18:58,528
And I always will be.

216
00:19:00,112 --> 00:19:04,033
Are you always in the habit of
reading private correspondence?

217
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:06,577
Would you hold these
for me, please?

218
00:19:06,619 --> 00:19:08,371
Correspondence?

219
00:19:08,454 --> 00:19:11,707
This is more like
a diary of frustration.

220
00:19:14,043 --> 00:19:18,923
"Number of Lon Di
subsidiaries worldwide 1,223."

221
00:19:19,048 --> 00:19:22,969
"Number of female
Managing Directors, 0."

222
00:19:23,052 --> 00:19:24,554
That first number
is not correct.

223
00:19:24,637 --> 00:19:28,307
It's 1,224 now,

224
00:19:28,391 --> 00:19:32,311
but the other number,
that is quite accurate.

225
00:19:32,395 --> 00:19:34,981
You've succeeded
in arousing my curiosity.

226
00:19:35,106 --> 00:19:37,316
Now, I'm wondering
what it is you want.

227
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:40,653
Well, I... I think the
question is, Miss Quinn, is,

228
00:19:40,736 --> 00:19:42,822
what is it
that you want?

229
00:19:44,824 --> 00:19:46,993
Hey, this is ridiculous.

230
00:19:47,076 --> 00:19:48,661
They're... they're going
to knock over a bank

231
00:19:48,744 --> 00:19:51,539
in the middle of London
in broad daylight.

232
00:19:57,837 --> 00:19:59,505
I could have
your job for this.

233
00:19:59,589 --> 00:20:02,675
Yeah, and they might
just give it to you.

234
00:20:02,717 --> 00:20:05,177
I know that you've been
passed over six times

235
00:20:05,261 --> 00:20:07,096
in the last three years

236
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:09,515
for someone less
qualified than you.

237
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,017
You know this has
been illuminating,

238
00:20:11,058 --> 00:20:12,393
but I am really
am very, very busy.

239
00:20:12,435 --> 00:20:14,687
Miss Quinn, please.
Please sit down.

240
00:20:14,729 --> 00:20:17,189
Please sit down. Please.

241
00:20:17,273 --> 00:20:22,528
I... I haven't got
to my point yet.

242
00:20:22,612 --> 00:20:23,779
They're going
to fire you.

243
00:20:24,947 --> 00:20:26,073
Excuse me?

244
00:20:26,115 --> 00:20:29,535
Yes, your ingenious
Russian proposal.

245
00:20:29,618 --> 00:20:31,162
How do you know
about that?

246
00:20:31,203 --> 00:20:32,705
How do you know
all of my business?

247
00:20:32,705 --> 00:20:33,748
Shh!
Shh!

248
00:20:35,374 --> 00:20:37,043
I'm only trying to help.

249
00:20:39,795 --> 00:20:42,089
You know,
it's extraordinary

250
00:20:42,214 --> 00:20:45,301
the conversations people will
have in front of their cleaners.

251
00:20:45,343 --> 00:20:47,386
It's like...
like we don't exist.

252
00:20:47,386 --> 00:20:49,138
What conversations?

253
00:20:49,221 --> 00:20:50,681
Well, I'm not a businessman,

254
00:20:50,723 --> 00:20:52,308
but I certainly
got the gist of it.

255
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:53,642
What conversations?

256
00:20:53,684 --> 00:20:56,062
Well, the Russians
won't accept your plan

257
00:20:56,187 --> 00:20:59,190
unless it's kept secret
among senior staff...

258
00:20:59,231 --> 00:21:01,567
and only
the senior staff.

259
00:21:02,943 --> 00:21:05,279
They don't seem to think
that you qualify.

260
00:21:06,572 --> 00:21:08,741
Well, I don't believe you.

261
00:21:08,824 --> 00:21:10,993
Well, uh, you...
you're probably right.

262
00:21:11,077 --> 00:21:14,413
The ramblings
of an old man, eh?

263
00:21:14,413 --> 00:21:16,373
Who would notice?

264
00:21:16,415 --> 00:21:18,084
Hey, this is a good bit.

265
00:21:18,084 --> 00:21:19,418
Look there.

266
00:21:21,462 --> 00:21:23,089
Would you like a peanut?

267
00:21:43,442 --> 00:21:45,194
Oh, is MKA in?

268
00:21:45,277 --> 00:21:47,279
He's just left.
That's odd.

269
00:21:47,363 --> 00:21:49,615
Someone from the Prime
Minister's Office is in the lobby.

270
00:21:49,615 --> 00:21:50,908
Says he has
an appointment.

271
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,034
Hmm.

272
00:21:52,076 --> 00:21:55,621
Oh, no, that's
not right at all.

273
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,838
Ahem.

274
00:22:45,921 --> 00:22:47,089
Well, I seem
to be the end

275
00:22:47,172 --> 00:22:48,257
of the whole restaurant.

276
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,009
You look wonderful.

277
00:22:50,009 --> 00:22:52,428
Well, I heard reinvention
was the latest craze.

278
00:22:52,511 --> 00:22:54,597
Thought I'd try
it on for size.

279
00:22:56,015 --> 00:22:57,099
Thank you for seeing me.

280
00:22:57,182 --> 00:22:59,101
Well, don't thank me
too quickly.

281
00:22:59,184 --> 00:23:00,936
Um, ahem.

282
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:05,608
It's bad news, I'm afraid.

283
00:23:05,691 --> 00:23:07,610
We can't offer you a position.

284
00:23:07,693 --> 00:23:08,777
Really, why not?

285
00:23:08,861 --> 00:23:11,363
There's a conflict
of interests.

286
00:23:11,447 --> 00:23:14,700
Lon Di is our largest client,
back to the Boer War.

287
00:23:14,783 --> 00:23:18,537
We funded Ernest Ashtoncroft's
first diamond mines 70 years ago.

288
00:23:18,621 --> 00:23:20,039
Well, it's done
all the time.

289
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:22,958
You simply ask their
permission to speak with me.

290
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:25,377
Say I know nothing
about it, unsolicited.

291
00:23:25,461 --> 00:23:26,879
That sort of thing.
I did.

292
00:23:26,879 --> 00:23:31,383
Look, and I tell you this
in confidence as an old friend.

293
00:23:31,467 --> 00:23:33,719
But they're saying you're
grossly incompetent.

294
00:23:33,802 --> 00:23:36,055
Claim you botched their
relations with the Russians.

295
00:23:36,138 --> 00:23:39,725
That is absolutely
ridiculous.

296
00:23:39,808 --> 00:23:41,560
I am sorry.

297
00:23:41,644 --> 00:23:44,313
Word came down quietly you
are not to be touched by us

298
00:23:44,396 --> 00:23:49,401
or in all likelihood by anyone
doing business with Lon Di.

299
00:23:49,485 --> 00:23:51,904
Well, that's every
last company on earth.

300
00:23:55,657 --> 00:23:58,577
You said you, um,
had something else to discuss.

301
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:04,833
Well, I... I feel
stupid now.

302
00:24:04,917 --> 00:24:07,920
I was going to finally
accept your offer of dinner.

303
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:11,340
Well, that, um, would have
to be unadventurous.

304
00:24:11,423 --> 00:24:13,175
Married now five years,

305
00:24:13,258 --> 00:24:16,095
three rather boisterous
girls to prove it.

306
00:24:16,178 --> 00:24:17,763
You should come
over one Sunday.

307
00:24:19,598 --> 00:24:21,600
Mmm, good soup.

308
00:24:51,547 --> 00:24:53,298
Early lunch, Miss Quinn?

309
00:24:53,382 --> 00:24:55,884
Very early
and very long.

310
00:24:55,968 --> 00:24:57,719
I'm taking
the afternoon off.

311
00:25:51,106 --> 00:25:52,357
Placed a bet,
Miss Quinn?

312
00:25:52,441 --> 00:25:54,526
Oh, I never gamble.

313
00:25:54,610 --> 00:25:58,030
Not on dogs, cards,
or strangers.

314
00:25:58,113 --> 00:25:59,531
You were right.

315
00:25:59,615 --> 00:26:00,949
Was I?

316
00:26:01,033 --> 00:26:04,036
Why do you want to steal
from the company?

317
00:26:04,119 --> 00:26:05,454
Who said I did?

318
00:26:05,537 --> 00:26:08,040
Hypothetically.

319
00:26:08,123 --> 00:26:09,374
War and plunder,

320
00:26:09,458 --> 00:26:12,210
the two most reliable
sources of income.

321
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:14,379
I didn't realize
we were at war.

322
00:26:21,386 --> 00:26:22,721
In six months' time

323
00:26:22,804 --> 00:26:25,390
I shall retire
to a hearty pat on the back

324
00:26:25,390 --> 00:26:27,643
and a not to hearty pension,

325
00:26:27,726 --> 00:26:30,729
a situation
in dire need of attention.

326
00:26:30,729 --> 00:26:33,815
So money, plain
and simple?

327
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:37,319
Suppose I wanted to do
something for my wife.

328
00:26:37,402 --> 00:26:39,571
Your wife
who died 15 years ago?

329
00:26:39,571 --> 00:26:41,323
The one you're
happily married to?

330
00:26:41,406 --> 00:26:43,408
Lovely. You did
your homework.

331
00:26:43,408 --> 00:26:44,993
I guess you would.

332
00:26:45,077 --> 00:26:46,912
What else
did you uncover?

333
00:26:46,995 --> 00:26:48,413
That you're far
from stupid,

334
00:26:48,413 --> 00:26:50,749
and you were forced to
apprentice under your father,

335
00:26:50,749 --> 00:26:52,417
the one
with the drinking problem.

336
00:26:52,417 --> 00:26:56,588
Oh, yes, married at 21 and years
later when your wife became ill,

337
00:26:56,588 --> 00:26:58,256
you took the night job
at London Diamonds

338
00:26:58,340 --> 00:27:00,926
so you could spend
your days by her side.

339
00:27:00,926 --> 00:27:03,261
You never did use
those qualifications.

340
00:27:05,597 --> 00:27:08,183
Clever, Miss Quinn.

341
00:27:08,266 --> 00:27:09,518
Clever.

342
00:27:09,601 --> 00:27:11,353
How do you know
I won't turn you in?

343
00:27:11,436 --> 00:27:13,522
Are we still speaking
hypothetically?

344
00:27:13,605 --> 00:27:16,108
I mean, what makes you think
you can pull off such a thing?

345
00:27:16,108 --> 00:27:18,777
Well, simply because
I have a plan.

346
00:27:28,286 --> 00:27:32,874
What I propose involves
the least possible risk

347
00:27:32,958 --> 00:27:37,045
because we don't have to
change our normal routines.

348
00:27:38,630 --> 00:27:42,384
Each night at 9:00...

349
00:27:42,467 --> 00:27:44,469
they lock the front doors,

350
00:27:44,553 --> 00:27:46,221
which means,
that for 10 hours,

351
00:27:46,304 --> 00:27:49,307
no one can go in
or out of the building.

352
00:27:49,391 --> 00:27:52,060
They increase the security
on the main floor

353
00:27:52,144 --> 00:27:54,980
but on the lower floor they
just keep these two guards,

354
00:27:55,063 --> 00:27:58,483
here and here
by the lift,

355
00:27:58,483 --> 00:28:00,902
which is the sole
point of access.

356
00:28:00,986 --> 00:28:03,905
You intend to go
for the vault?

357
00:28:03,989 --> 00:28:05,490
That's where
the diamonds are.

358
00:28:05,574 --> 00:28:06,825
You can't be serious.

359
00:28:06,825 --> 00:28:10,996
Generally, each evening I
start on the fourth floor

360
00:28:11,079 --> 00:28:13,665
and work
me way down, see?

361
00:28:16,918 --> 00:28:18,670
Nice day today.

362
00:28:18,753 --> 00:28:21,006
Once through
the outer floors

363
00:28:21,006 --> 00:28:24,176
I'm escorted
to the sub basement.

364
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:33,018
The next few hours are
spent on rubbish collection,

365
00:28:33,101 --> 00:28:37,355
mopping, waxing, minor
repair and maintenance.

366
00:28:44,112 --> 00:28:48,116
During that time,
I'll work mostly unattended.

367
00:28:50,702 --> 00:28:52,954
Once an hour or so,
someone checks up on me.

368
00:28:56,708 --> 00:28:59,377
Otherwise, I'm
left entirely to myself.

369
00:28:59,461 --> 00:29:00,712
I mean, in theory,

370
00:29:00,795 --> 00:29:04,049
I could take off all my
clothes and walk around naked.

371
00:29:04,132 --> 00:29:05,884
A frightening thought,
Miss Quinn.

372
00:29:05,967 --> 00:29:07,552
Don't dwell on it.

373
00:29:07,636 --> 00:29:09,471
I'll try not to.

374
00:29:09,554 --> 00:29:11,806
I've saved the vault
hallway for last.

375
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:14,976
The long corridor that leads
to a circular door,

376
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,561
behind which

377
00:29:16,645 --> 00:29:22,233
lies one of the largest singular
deposits of riches on earth.

378
00:29:24,235 --> 00:29:26,404
For 16 years
I've been working

379
00:29:26,488 --> 00:29:28,823
within a hare's
breath of that door,

380
00:29:28,907 --> 00:29:33,495
and for 16 years I've never
opened it, not once.

381
00:29:33,578 --> 00:29:36,915
You couldn't if you wanted
to, not without the codes.

382
00:29:36,998 --> 00:29:39,918
The codes are changed weekly
and entrusted to only two people.

383
00:29:40,001 --> 00:29:44,255
Mr. Eaton, lifelong company
servant, portrait of reliability.

384
00:29:44,255 --> 00:29:48,927
Rumor has it that the swiss use
his pulse to set their clocks by.

385
00:29:48,927 --> 00:29:52,681
And, of course, Sir Milton
Kendrick Ashtoncroft,

386
00:29:52,764 --> 00:29:55,350
aging ruler of everything
that daylight touches.

387
00:29:55,433 --> 00:29:58,853
And you plan to obtain
the codes how?

388
00:29:58,937 --> 00:30:01,106
That's where you come in,
Miss Quinn.

389
00:30:01,106 --> 00:30:05,193
Until recently, this was
supposed to be a solo operation.

390
00:30:06,778 --> 00:30:09,531
A year ago, quite by accident,

391
00:30:09,614 --> 00:30:13,868
I discovered that Sir Milton kept
the codes concealed in his desk.

392
00:30:36,057 --> 00:30:38,977
Then some months back,
they were gone.

393
00:30:40,311 --> 00:30:41,396
Night after night,

394
00:30:41,479 --> 00:30:45,650
I searched the office,
but they never turned up.

395
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:46,734
Why'd you wait?

396
00:30:46,818 --> 00:30:48,653
Why not do it while
you had the chance?

397
00:30:48,653 --> 00:30:51,990
Oh, I've asked myself that
question a thousand times.

398
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:55,577
I told you, I'm...
I'm not courageous.

399
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:58,830
But my hesitating
will be your gain.

400
00:30:58,913 --> 00:31:00,081
Will it?

401
00:31:00,165 --> 00:31:01,499
And what will
that require?

402
00:31:01,583 --> 00:31:04,085
Here, proof of conviction.

403
00:31:04,169 --> 00:31:07,255
You are on the, uh,
guest list, are you?

404
00:31:09,174 --> 00:31:11,676
It's business.
I'm expected.

405
00:31:11,759 --> 00:31:13,678
We're entertaining
the Russians.

406
00:31:13,761 --> 00:31:15,847
You suspect he keeps
the codes at home?

407
00:31:15,930 --> 00:31:18,600
On Saturday, go to his study

408
00:31:18,683 --> 00:31:21,019
and look under the center
drawer in his desk.

409
00:31:21,102 --> 00:31:23,605
This is ridiculous.

410
00:31:23,688 --> 00:31:25,356
Say I did find the codes

411
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:28,359
and you were able to slip in
and out of the vault undetected.

412
00:31:28,443 --> 00:31:31,029
How would you get the
diamonds out of the building?

413
00:31:38,953 --> 00:31:41,206
How much will it hold?

414
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:44,209
How much would
you like it to hold?

415
00:31:44,292 --> 00:31:46,878
What's the price of revenge?

416
00:31:46,878 --> 00:31:49,380
Difficult, eh?

417
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,382
Would a million pound do?

418
00:31:53,134 --> 00:31:55,136
Each?
I should think so.

419
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,889
They wouldn't even
notice that much.

420
00:31:57,972 --> 00:31:59,224
Well, by then...

421
00:31:59,307 --> 00:32:01,893
I'll be retired and
you'll have been let go.

422
00:32:01,976 --> 00:32:03,144
Why should I trust you?

423
00:32:03,228 --> 00:32:04,896
The same reason
I have to trust you.

424
00:32:04,979 --> 00:32:06,481
We have the same objective.

425
00:32:06,564 --> 00:32:09,317
Oh, you make it all
sound so easy.

426
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,568
Is that a yes?

427
00:32:10,652 --> 00:32:11,986
No, it isn't.

428
00:32:14,322 --> 00:32:16,574
Be sure to wear
something nice.

429
00:32:43,685 --> 00:32:44,936
Good evening, sir.

430
00:32:52,944 --> 00:32:54,445
Come on in.

431
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,948
The Russians here?

432
00:33:22,974 --> 00:33:24,892
To pressurized carbon.

433
00:33:26,978 --> 00:33:28,479
Here here!

434
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:34,068
Now that's
a sight worth seeing.

435
00:33:34,152 --> 00:33:36,654
Sir Clifton Sinclair, our
very own insurance man,

436
00:33:36,738 --> 00:33:39,741
making a rare trip down from
his ivory tower at King's Row.

437
00:33:39,824 --> 00:33:42,994
No doubt losing sleep over our
somewhat top heavy inventory.

438
00:33:43,077 --> 00:33:44,912
Oh, I don't think Sinclair's
the type to lose sleep.

439
00:33:44,996 --> 00:33:46,831
It's rather unnerving
to consider a man

440
00:33:46,914 --> 00:33:49,917
with that history as London
diamond's greatest guarantor.

441
00:33:51,669 --> 00:33:54,005
Ooh, you didn't know.

442
00:33:54,005 --> 00:33:56,174
He was mixed up in all
those insurance scandals

443
00:33:56,257 --> 00:33:58,509
before the national
health service.

444
00:33:58,509 --> 00:34:00,511
Of course, he's
completely innocent,

445
00:34:00,511 --> 00:34:02,263
or he was never prosecuted.

446
00:34:02,346 --> 00:34:04,599
Otherwise, we wouldn't
do business together.

447
00:34:04,682 --> 00:34:07,768
Allow me to present
Vladimir Dmitriev,

448
00:34:07,852 --> 00:34:11,272
head of the Soviet
Diamond Authority.

449
00:34:11,355 --> 00:34:13,191
Mr. Chanson,
my second in command.

450
00:34:13,191 --> 00:34:14,358
How do you do?

451
00:34:14,442 --> 00:34:16,027
And miss
Laura Quinn,

452
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:18,529
one of our
brightest gems.

453
00:34:26,454 --> 00:34:28,706
Ballet, vodka, diamonds,

454
00:34:28,789 --> 00:34:30,958
the three things closest
to the Russian soul.

455
00:34:31,042 --> 00:34:32,293
And which do you prefer?

456
00:34:32,376 --> 00:34:33,794
Diamonds, of course.

457
00:34:33,878 --> 00:34:35,213
I'll drink to that.

458
00:34:41,552 --> 00:34:44,388
My lord!

459
00:34:44,472 --> 00:34:47,725
And what would you have
done had I said ballet?

460
00:34:47,808 --> 00:34:49,227
I would ask you to dance.

461
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:02,073
Of course, I have
ulterior motives.

462
00:35:02,156 --> 00:35:05,409
And, um, what makes
you think I don't?

463
00:35:05,493 --> 00:35:07,245
I shall miss her.

464
00:35:16,087 --> 00:35:18,089
How's the old man
bearing up?

465
00:35:18,089 --> 00:35:20,091
Oh, I expect
he'll outlive us all.

466
00:35:20,174 --> 00:35:22,593
Well, I only ask because
I should think hoarding

467
00:35:22,677 --> 00:35:27,181
basically a worthless commodity
would be very bad for his heart.

468
00:35:31,269 --> 00:35:32,853
What am I doing?

469
00:35:36,607 --> 00:35:39,777
I ask myself that
repeatedly.

470
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:42,530
Sorry.
I didn't see you.

471
00:35:42,613 --> 00:35:44,532
Purely by design.

472
00:35:44,615 --> 00:35:47,785
You've stumbled into my lair,
my sanctuary of sorts.

473
00:35:47,785 --> 00:35:50,037
Yes, I think I know
what you mean.

474
00:35:51,622 --> 00:35:53,541
At least the evening
is a success.

475
00:35:53,624 --> 00:35:55,876
Your father's spared
no expense.

476
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:58,462
Never does,
always first class,

477
00:35:58,587 --> 00:36:01,549
so long as it's discreet
and doesn't attract attention.

478
00:36:01,632 --> 00:36:05,594
Yes, he's famous
for his discretion.

479
00:36:05,594 --> 00:36:08,723
Is it true he paid 100
pounds to the families

480
00:36:08,806 --> 00:36:10,641
of the miners
who died in protest?

481
00:36:12,059 --> 00:36:14,478
Anonymously.

482
00:36:14,562 --> 00:36:16,981
Pulled the bullets
from the caskets.

483
00:36:18,733 --> 00:36:20,317
Should be a discount
for that.

484
00:36:21,777 --> 00:36:23,654
What sort of man
does such a thing?

485
00:36:25,573 --> 00:36:28,284
A man of conscience.

486
00:39:24,001 --> 00:39:25,919
Mr. Hobbs.

487
00:39:27,129 --> 00:39:30,507
I'm having trouble with
the heat in my office.

488
00:39:30,507 --> 00:39:33,260
Uh, Miss Quinn,
do you want...

489
00:39:33,343 --> 00:39:37,347
more or less heat
in your office?

490
00:39:37,431 --> 00:39:41,602
If we do this, I want
to know every last detail.

491
00:39:41,685 --> 00:39:43,020
Understand?

492
00:39:44,563 --> 00:39:46,023
Ok.

493
00:40:12,549 --> 00:40:15,344
Now, if you just
lock it off under there.

494
00:40:36,448 --> 00:40:38,033
We have to call it off.

495
00:40:38,158 --> 00:40:40,869
They've installed
security cameras.

496
00:40:40,994 --> 00:40:43,580
Closed Circuit Television
monitoring everything.

497
00:40:43,664 --> 00:40:46,375
I've been with them all
morning showing interest.

498
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,834
Cameras in the building?

499
00:40:47,918 --> 00:40:50,087
Yes, inside, outside,
halls, lobby.

500
00:40:50,087 --> 00:40:51,046
In the vault?

501
00:40:51,171 --> 00:40:52,256
No, but
the vault corridor.

502
00:40:52,339 --> 00:40:54,007
They don't want
security guards staring

503
00:40:54,091 --> 00:40:55,342
at mounds
of diamonds all day.

504
00:40:55,425 --> 00:40:56,426
Can you blame them?

505
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,512
Oh, security cameras,
goodness gracious.

506
00:40:58,595 --> 00:41:00,097
What'll they
think up next?

507
00:41:00,097 --> 00:41:01,431
Is there any way
around them?

508
00:41:01,473 --> 00:41:03,267
No, absolutely not.

509
00:41:03,308 --> 00:41:04,351
No?

510
00:41:04,434 --> 00:41:05,894
There are eight
separate cameras

511
00:41:06,019 --> 00:41:07,604
covering the entire
sub basement,

512
00:41:07,729 --> 00:41:10,357
including one dedicated
to the vault corridor.

513
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,359
The cameras link
to the guard station,

514
00:41:12,442 --> 00:41:16,530
and Eaton has a man on watch 24
hours a day, seven days a week.

515
00:41:17,781 --> 00:41:19,283
Basement's here.

516
00:41:19,366 --> 00:41:21,827
We've got reception,
boardroom, the corridor.

517
00:41:21,868 --> 00:41:24,788
So you'll just have to
reconsider that pension of yours.

518
00:41:24,788 --> 00:41:27,040
All right.
So, fool proof, eh?

519
00:41:27,124 --> 00:41:30,294
And you came all the way
over to the wrong side

520
00:41:30,377 --> 00:41:31,795
of town to tell me...

521
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:34,881
when you could've
told me tonight.

522
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,051
You've seen a way,
haven't you?

523
00:41:38,135 --> 00:41:39,886
I have not, Mr. Hobbs.

524
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:42,556
Your tenacity reminds
me of my wife.

525
00:41:45,392 --> 00:41:47,311
Why are you being
so persistent?

526
00:41:47,352 --> 00:41:49,813
Because I hate
English winters.

527
00:41:51,523 --> 00:41:54,067
Now, tell me how
it can be done.

528
00:41:56,486 --> 00:41:58,238
All right. There's
one possibility,

529
00:41:58,322 --> 00:41:59,489
but I'm telling you,
it won't work.

530
00:41:59,614 --> 00:42:02,492
Although there are eight
cameras in the sub basement,

531
00:42:02,492 --> 00:42:05,329
only four images are on
screen at any one time.

532
00:42:05,412 --> 00:42:06,580
Four on, four off,

533
00:42:06,663 --> 00:42:09,249
and since the images cycle
in 15-second intervals,

534
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:10,834
they reappear
in the order they leave.

535
00:42:10,917 --> 00:42:12,502
So each image
is off-screen for...

536
00:42:12,627 --> 00:42:14,004
60 seconds, yeah?

537
00:42:14,087 --> 00:42:16,548
Yeah, 60 seconds,
but that's not enough time.

538
00:42:16,590 --> 00:42:17,674
Enough time?

539
00:42:17,758 --> 00:42:19,092
I'll be in that vault
in 10 seconds flat.

540
00:42:19,176 --> 00:42:20,969
You can't be standing
outside the vault

541
00:42:20,969 --> 00:42:22,429
when the image goes
off screen

542
00:42:22,512 --> 00:42:24,097
and be nowhere in sight
when it reappears.

543
00:42:24,181 --> 00:42:26,099
You have to start
at the end of the corridor,

544
00:42:26,183 --> 00:42:27,517
and that's 40 yards long.

545
00:42:27,601 --> 00:42:30,353
Well, I don't have
a problem with that.

546
00:42:30,437 --> 00:42:32,189
With all due respect,
Mr. Hobbs,

547
00:42:32,272 --> 00:42:34,357
you can hardly walk,
let alone run.

548
00:42:34,441 --> 00:42:36,693
I'm telling you,
I can do it.

549
00:42:39,863 --> 00:42:42,199
This has gone too far.

550
00:42:42,282 --> 00:42:44,034
I'm sorry.

551
00:42:44,117 --> 00:42:48,371
You're involved now,
whether you like it or not.

552
00:42:48,455 --> 00:42:49,873
I beg your pardon.

553
00:42:49,915 --> 00:42:53,210
You gave me the code, Miss
Quinn, so you're involved.

554
00:42:53,293 --> 00:42:55,545
Make no mistake.

555
00:42:55,629 --> 00:42:56,880
I'm going through
with this.

556
00:42:56,963 --> 00:42:59,633
And don't you pretend
to me that you don't want it,

557
00:42:59,716 --> 00:43:01,635
because you want
it more than I do.

558
00:43:01,718 --> 00:43:04,554
You want a life that means
something that adds up.

559
00:43:04,638 --> 00:43:08,725
And you know that this is the
only way you're going to get it.

560
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:12,854
Miss Quinn,
you said it yourself.

561
00:43:12,896 --> 00:43:14,648
They're never going
to notice it.

562
00:43:19,569 --> 00:43:21,071
This is how it'll work.

563
00:43:21,154 --> 00:43:23,657
Tomorrow we'll
synchronize our watches,

564
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:24,866
but it has
to be tomorrow

565
00:43:24,908 --> 00:43:27,702
before they realize
the flaw in the system.

566
00:43:27,744 --> 00:43:30,080
At the exact moment you're
at the vault corridor,

567
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:31,665
I'll call
the guard station.

568
00:43:31,748 --> 00:43:34,584
That should buy you at
least 30 more seconds.

569
00:43:36,419 --> 00:43:39,840
When this is over, I think
best we not speak again.

570
00:44:14,124 --> 00:44:15,667
Evening, Miss Quinn.

571
00:44:15,792 --> 00:44:17,502
Evening, Henry.

572
00:44:20,463 --> 00:44:23,967
Evening, Henry.
Albert.

573
00:44:25,969 --> 00:44:28,388
Evening, Miss Quinn.
May I?

574
00:44:31,057 --> 00:44:32,225
What's the word,
Henry?

575
00:44:32,309 --> 00:44:34,185
Ask me again on Friday.

576
00:44:44,863 --> 00:44:45,905
Good night, sir.

577
00:44:45,989 --> 00:44:47,073
Good night.

578
00:48:35,051 --> 00:48:35,968
Ah!

579
00:48:42,141 --> 00:48:43,059
Ah!

580
00:49:01,828 --> 00:49:03,413
Damn it.

581
00:50:16,485 --> 00:50:17,486
Willis.

582
00:50:19,405 --> 00:50:20,323
Hello?

583
00:52:21,527 --> 00:52:22,778
Halt!

584
00:52:27,616 --> 00:52:29,034
I'm afraid
there's a problem.

585
00:52:29,118 --> 00:52:30,703
If you won't mind,
come along with me.

586
00:52:42,631 --> 00:52:44,216
Uh...

587
00:52:44,300 --> 00:52:45,634
Mr. Lewis, I'm afraid.

588
00:52:45,718 --> 00:52:47,720
God knows what
that man ingests.

589
00:52:50,389 --> 00:52:51,724
Would you mind?

590
00:52:53,309 --> 00:52:55,060
I'll, uh,
leave you to it.

591
00:53:07,072 --> 00:53:08,073
Mr. Hobbs.

592
00:53:08,157 --> 00:53:10,326
Morning, Miss Quinn.

593
00:53:10,409 --> 00:53:12,494
How are things
this morning, Henry?

594
00:53:12,578 --> 00:53:15,497
In a word, dull.

595
00:54:24,483 --> 00:54:26,568
Isn't there
a sight next week?

596
00:54:26,652 --> 00:54:29,071
Fifth Monday.

597
00:54:29,071 --> 00:54:31,573
That's very odd.
The sorties have gone home.

598
00:54:33,742 --> 00:54:34,827
Is he here yet?

599
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:36,078
MKA, is he here yet?

600
00:54:36,078 --> 00:54:37,246
No, sir.

601
00:54:37,246 --> 00:54:40,165
Mr. Jameson, what happened?
What is so important?

602
00:54:54,096 --> 00:54:56,432
Miss Quinn?

603
00:54:57,433 --> 00:54:59,435
Miss Quinn, you in there?

604
00:55:02,938 --> 00:55:04,273
I need not remind you

605
00:55:04,273 --> 00:55:05,774
we're all bound to the
strictest confidentiality.

606
00:55:05,774 --> 00:55:08,610
Under no circumstances
are we to discuss the incident.

607
00:55:08,610 --> 00:55:09,695
Any acts to the contrary

608
00:55:09,778 --> 00:55:11,196
will result in the
severest consequences.

609
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:13,532
Is that clear?
Yes, of course.

610
00:56:04,666 --> 00:56:07,419
The elevator's
the single point of entry,

611
00:56:07,502 --> 00:56:09,838
no underground tunnels,

612
00:56:09,922 --> 00:56:11,506
three narrow
ventilation ducts,

613
00:56:11,590 --> 00:56:12,841
all of which
lead nowhere.

614
00:56:12,925 --> 00:56:15,177
The entire sub basement
is encased in concrete,

615
00:56:15,260 --> 00:56:18,013
marble and the outer casing
is solid steel.

616
00:56:18,013 --> 00:56:20,515
This has to be the most secure
facility in all of Europe.

617
00:56:20,599 --> 00:56:23,685
That's certainly
what we believed.

618
00:56:23,769 --> 00:56:26,355
Besides, there was nearly
two tons of diamonds.

619
00:56:26,438 --> 00:56:29,358
You would need an army
of men and several vehicles.

620
00:56:38,283 --> 00:56:40,786
Now, you all know
Sir Clifton Sinclair,

621
00:56:40,869 --> 00:56:43,288
from King's Row,
our underwriters.

622
00:56:43,372 --> 00:56:46,375
Well, we've talked it
through and we have agreed

623
00:56:46,458 --> 00:56:49,461
that our utmost priority must be
the appearance of business as usual.

624
00:56:49,544 --> 00:56:52,547
I mean... any police
investigation

625
00:56:52,631 --> 00:56:56,385
and subsequent publicity
would be a disaster.

626
00:56:56,385 --> 00:56:58,637
Just like that,
all confidence gone.

627
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:01,306
So we handle
the matter privately.

628
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:03,392
Sinclair.

629
00:57:03,475 --> 00:57:05,394
As you all know, King's
Row has been behind

630
00:57:05,477 --> 00:57:08,563
London Diamond
for the last 70 years.

631
00:57:08,647 --> 00:57:10,399
And today
is no exception.

632
00:57:10,482 --> 00:57:11,900
With that in mind,

633
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:13,318
I'd like to introduce
you to Sir Gavin Finch,

634
00:57:13,402 --> 00:57:15,570
our Chief
Insurance Investigator.

635
00:57:15,654 --> 00:57:17,072
Mr. Finch.

636
00:57:17,155 --> 00:57:18,407
Good morning, everyone.

637
00:57:18,407 --> 00:57:21,243
Please, there
is no need to panic.

638
00:57:21,326 --> 00:57:23,078
We will find
your diamonds.

639
00:57:23,161 --> 00:57:25,414
No need to panic?
The royal supply of diamonds

640
00:57:25,414 --> 00:57:26,832
has vanished
into thin air

641
00:57:26,915 --> 00:57:28,500
and there's no need
to panic?

642
00:57:28,583 --> 00:57:30,168
I will see inside
the vault now

643
00:57:30,252 --> 00:57:32,504
and if the night staff could
be called back, thank you.

644
00:57:48,770 --> 00:57:50,856
What have you done?

645
00:57:50,939 --> 00:57:53,024
It's all in hand,
Miss Quinn.

646
00:57:53,108 --> 00:57:55,110
In hand?
In hand?

647
00:57:55,193 --> 00:57:57,195
The contents of
a thermos, you said.

648
00:57:57,279 --> 00:57:59,281
When you're finished,
meet me at the café

649
00:57:59,364 --> 00:58:01,199
at the corner
of Hatton Ground.

650
00:58:01,283 --> 00:58:03,618
Mr. Hobbs.

651
00:58:03,702 --> 00:58:04,786
Yes.

652
00:58:04,786 --> 00:58:06,621
This way, please.

653
00:58:37,402 --> 00:58:39,654
Not one of your
better ideas, Miss Quinn.

654
00:58:39,738 --> 00:58:41,656
I suggest
we cut this short.

655
00:58:41,740 --> 00:58:42,824
What have you done
with the diamonds?

656
00:58:42,908 --> 00:58:45,076
I want answers,
and I want them now.

657
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,995
You're gonna get them
all in good time.

658
00:58:47,078 --> 00:58:48,663
Oh, I can't breathe!

659
00:58:48,747 --> 00:58:50,165
I insist
that you remain calm.

660
00:58:50,248 --> 00:58:51,500
What did
you say to Finch?

661
00:58:51,583 --> 00:58:54,419
I told him I went
on shift as normal.

662
00:58:54,503 --> 00:58:56,087
I waxed the floors
for a while.

663
00:58:56,171 --> 00:58:59,174
I emptied the rubbish,
a normal night.

664
00:58:59,257 --> 00:59:01,092
I... I lied.

665
00:59:01,176 --> 00:59:02,344
I want you
to go back to work,

666
00:59:02,344 --> 00:59:04,095
do exactly
what we discussed,

667
00:59:04,179 --> 00:59:06,515
keep to your routine,
and we'll talk again.

668
00:59:06,598 --> 00:59:07,849
Ok?

669
00:59:07,933 --> 00:59:10,519
This is where
I'll be tomorrow.

670
00:59:19,861 --> 00:59:21,363
Miss Quinn?

671
00:59:21,363 --> 00:59:23,365
Sir Milton's office is
asking for you urgently.

672
00:59:28,703 --> 00:59:31,122
Should you elect
to purchase the goods

673
00:59:31,206 --> 00:59:34,542
you must notify me
by week's end.

674
00:59:34,542 --> 00:59:36,711
It's my understanding
that specifics

675
00:59:36,711 --> 00:59:39,381
as to the inventory
and to the purchase terms

676
00:59:39,464 --> 00:59:42,217
are explicitly set forth
in this letter.

677
00:59:47,722 --> 00:59:49,975
And importantly,
I'm not to be made privy

678
00:59:50,058 --> 00:59:53,061
to any arrangement between
my client and yourself.

679
00:59:53,144 --> 00:59:55,146
You are simply to alert me
to your intentions,

680
00:59:55,230 --> 00:59:57,232
at which point I will
provide instructions

681
00:59:57,315 --> 01:00:00,068
regarding method of payment.

682
01:00:00,068 --> 01:00:04,072
My client will then convey where
you may take possession of the goods.

683
01:00:04,155 --> 01:00:06,741
Mr. Boyle,
are we to understand

684
01:00:06,825 --> 01:00:10,412
the identity of your client
is unknown to you?

685
01:00:10,412 --> 01:00:11,913
That's correct.

686
01:00:11,997 --> 01:00:13,748
As is the nature
of this inventory?

687
01:00:13,832 --> 01:00:14,833
Also correct.

688
01:00:16,167 --> 01:00:18,753
Excuse me,
but there's a call

689
01:00:18,837 --> 01:00:21,756
for Mr. Boyle
from his office.

690
01:00:26,428 --> 01:00:28,596
What in the name
of God is all this?

691
01:00:36,604 --> 01:00:40,442
"Now available a selection
of uncut diamonds,

692
01:00:40,442 --> 01:00:44,279
"market price, 100 million
pounds sterling."

693
01:00:44,279 --> 01:00:47,615
Is that it?
Is that all it says?

694
01:00:47,699 --> 01:00:49,784
"Payable within 48 hours."

695
01:00:49,868 --> 01:00:51,703
We've been hijacked
by madmen!

696
01:00:51,786 --> 01:00:53,955
Shouldn't this man
be detained?

697
01:00:53,955 --> 01:00:56,791
I'm afraid Mr. Boyle has
told us all he knows.

698
01:00:59,627 --> 01:01:02,046
Pardon the interruption.

699
01:01:06,301 --> 01:01:08,303
Is there anything further?

700
01:01:12,056 --> 01:01:15,059
I will await your call.

701
01:01:15,143 --> 01:01:16,060
Good day.

702
01:01:42,003 --> 01:01:43,755
The South African Star.

703
01:01:46,341 --> 01:01:49,761
Get Sinclair back. Now!

704
01:01:56,935 --> 01:02:00,188
Ah, Miss Quinn, may I?

705
01:02:00,271 --> 01:02:02,023
I'm working my way
through personnel.

706
01:02:02,106 --> 01:02:03,024
Yes, please.

707
01:02:03,107 --> 01:02:05,109
Thank you.

708
01:02:05,193 --> 01:02:07,612
Take a seat.

709
01:02:22,961 --> 01:02:24,546
Would you care
for a cigarette?

710
01:02:24,629 --> 01:02:26,130
No, thank you.

711
01:02:34,889 --> 01:02:36,057
Thank you.

712
01:02:38,643 --> 01:02:41,729
Now... Miss Quinn...

713
01:02:44,649 --> 01:02:48,152
you're American, but you
were educated at Oxford.

714
01:02:48,236 --> 01:02:49,821
You have been working
here for 15 years,

715
01:02:49,904 --> 01:02:51,739
and you are now
a Senior Negotiator.

716
01:02:52,573 --> 01:02:54,075
That's right.

717
01:02:54,158 --> 01:02:56,077
Would you say you have
done well for yourself?

718
01:02:57,745 --> 01:02:58,746
Yes.

719
01:03:03,251 --> 01:03:05,503
Not married?
No.

720
01:03:07,171 --> 01:03:09,257
And you are 38?

721
01:03:10,925 --> 01:03:12,343
That's right,
Mr. Finch.

722
01:03:12,427 --> 01:03:14,762
I certainly hope
that's not a crime.

723
01:03:19,267 --> 01:03:20,601
Do you have any leads?

724
01:03:20,601 --> 01:03:21,602
Ahem.

725
01:03:24,022 --> 01:03:27,525
Now in your professional
capacity, Miss Quinn,

726
01:03:27,608 --> 01:03:30,028
who would you say were
London Diamond's enemies?

727
01:03:31,279 --> 01:03:33,448
It's potentially
a long list.

728
01:03:33,531 --> 01:03:35,366
We are a major
global business.

729
01:03:37,618 --> 01:03:39,620
Why do you think there could
be more to this than money?

730
01:03:39,620 --> 01:03:42,874
The diamond that
Mr. Boyle has left, the...

731
01:03:42,957 --> 01:03:45,043
Kimberly 4.

732
01:03:45,126 --> 01:03:49,297
530 karats, the fourth largest
cut diamond in the world.

733
01:03:49,380 --> 01:03:50,548
If it were
motivated by money,

734
01:03:50,631 --> 01:03:53,468
it's unlikely it would
still be in our possession.

735
01:03:55,553 --> 01:03:57,638
Are you saying
it's symbolic?

736
01:03:57,722 --> 01:04:01,059
It's also known
as the South African Star.

737
01:04:03,061 --> 01:04:04,562
Thank you, Miss Quinn.

738
01:04:04,645 --> 01:04:05,980
That'll be all for now.

739
01:04:12,070 --> 01:04:14,572
Oh, uh...

740
01:04:14,655 --> 01:04:15,990
that Mr. Hobbs,

741
01:04:16,074 --> 01:04:17,825
you're on good
terms with him?

742
01:04:17,909 --> 01:04:18,993
I suppose so.

743
01:04:19,076 --> 01:04:20,328
He's one of
the night janitors.

744
01:04:20,411 --> 01:04:22,497
Always seems quite jovial.

745
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:25,082
You were speaking to him
today in the corridor.

746
01:04:25,166 --> 01:04:27,835
Yes, I've been having
problems with my radiator.

747
01:04:27,919 --> 01:04:30,004
I asked him if he could
come and look at it.

748
01:04:30,004 --> 01:04:31,506
It's erratic.

749
01:04:31,589 --> 01:04:33,007
Temperature-wise.

750
01:04:33,007 --> 01:04:34,342
And did he manage
to solve the problem?

751
01:04:34,425 --> 01:04:39,096
I believe he was going to try
and find some time this week.

752
01:04:39,180 --> 01:04:41,516
Good. Thank you
again, Miss Quinn.

753
01:04:55,279 --> 01:04:57,865
Thank you, gentlemen,
for the instruction.

754
01:04:57,949 --> 01:05:00,034
I'll get back
to you in 24 hours.

755
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:04,038
Thank you.

756
01:05:09,877 --> 01:05:11,045
Good morning.

757
01:05:11,045 --> 01:05:12,046
Miss Quinn, good morning.

758
01:05:12,129 --> 01:05:14,048
You seem bright and
breezy this morning.

759
01:05:14,131 --> 01:05:16,050
I'd like to be given
authority to liaise

760
01:05:16,133 --> 01:05:18,135
with Mr. Finch
on the investigation.

761
01:05:18,219 --> 01:05:19,303
Why?

762
01:05:19,387 --> 01:05:20,805
With the time pressure
we're under we all need

763
01:05:20,888 --> 01:05:23,558
to be communicating as
efficiently as we're able. And...

764
01:05:23,558 --> 01:05:25,059
and?

765
01:05:25,059 --> 01:05:27,895
Finch was hired
by Sinclair.

766
01:05:27,895 --> 01:05:29,397
Well, I don't
see why not.

767
01:05:29,397 --> 01:05:32,066
There's a whole explosion
of nothing downstairs.

768
01:05:32,066 --> 01:05:34,235
I see the King's Row
lawyers are back.

769
01:05:34,318 --> 01:05:36,988
Surely they're not prepared to
pay the ransom on our behalf?

770
01:05:37,071 --> 01:05:39,073
Not if Sinclair has
anything to do with it.

771
01:05:39,073 --> 01:05:41,242
He's already lobbied the other
members of the syndicate

772
01:05:41,242 --> 01:05:42,493
against settling the claims.

773
01:05:42,577 --> 01:05:45,079
Saying the, uh, the deadlines
are unreasonable.

774
01:05:45,079 --> 01:05:46,080
But then of course he would,
wouldn't he?

775
01:05:46,080 --> 01:05:48,082
He's the majority
shareholder.

776
01:05:48,082 --> 01:05:51,419
His life would return
to zero, where he started.

777
01:05:51,502 --> 01:05:53,588
They're not bound
by contract?

778
01:05:53,588 --> 01:05:55,339
Miss Quinn, as I'm
sure you're aware

779
01:05:55,423 --> 01:05:57,091
where large personal
fortunes are concerned,

780
01:05:57,174 --> 01:06:00,011
contracts have a habit
of developing loopholes.

781
01:06:00,094 --> 01:06:04,098
And if that happened,
then we're insolvent.

782
01:06:04,098 --> 01:06:08,436
No diamonds. No sight.
The world knows.

783
01:06:08,436 --> 01:06:11,022
All hell breaks loose.

784
01:06:11,105 --> 01:06:14,525
You'll speak
to Mr. Finch?

785
01:06:14,608 --> 01:06:16,027
Tell him that
I'll be assisting.

786
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:17,862
It's our official
company position.

787
01:06:17,945 --> 01:06:21,032
Well, you seem
terribly keen.

788
01:06:21,115 --> 01:06:23,200
Well, my job
is at stake.

789
01:06:23,284 --> 01:06:25,202
All of ours are.

790
01:06:25,286 --> 01:06:26,203
All right.

791
01:06:26,287 --> 01:06:27,705
I'll speak
to him right now.

792
01:06:40,551 --> 01:06:42,553
This has just come
through, Mr. Finch.

793
01:06:49,977 --> 01:06:51,062
Miss Quinn.

794
01:06:51,145 --> 01:06:53,814
Mr. Jameson may have
spoken to you, uh,

795
01:06:53,814 --> 01:06:58,819
I'm to assist you in any way
I can with the investigation.

796
01:06:58,819 --> 01:07:00,488
Yes, he told me.

797
01:07:00,571 --> 01:07:02,406
I'm going down
to the vault now.

798
01:07:04,075 --> 01:07:05,493
Oh, these monitors.

799
01:07:05,493 --> 01:07:06,994
The new security system.

800
01:07:07,078 --> 01:07:08,579
Well, actually,
not very secure.

801
01:07:08,662 --> 01:07:10,915
Every 60 seconds
each corridor

802
01:07:10,998 --> 01:07:13,501
is left totally unobserved
for one full minute.

803
01:07:13,501 --> 01:07:16,670
Well, one minute, that's
not very much time.

804
01:07:16,754 --> 01:07:19,006
Time enough
to pass undetected.

805
01:07:24,929 --> 01:07:27,515
The lift is
the single point of entry.

806
01:07:27,598 --> 01:07:30,684
But the diamonds were not
removed by way of the lift.

807
01:07:30,768 --> 01:07:33,020
Each activation
is recorded,

808
01:07:33,104 --> 01:07:35,523
prompting an electronic
time stamp.

809
01:07:38,442 --> 01:07:40,694
As usual, there were
three trips that night.

810
01:07:40,778 --> 01:07:44,198
In each instance the lift
returned at once to the main level.

811
01:07:44,281 --> 01:07:46,367
So the lift was never
stationary long enough

812
01:07:46,367 --> 01:07:48,869
in the sub basement to load
the contents of the vault.

813
01:07:48,953 --> 01:07:49,870
That's right.

814
01:07:49,954 --> 01:07:51,705
You may need these.

815
01:08:00,881 --> 01:08:02,216
Excuse me.

816
01:08:04,218 --> 01:08:06,887
Steel, three inches thick,

817
01:08:06,971 --> 01:08:09,640
floor, ceiling, walls.

818
01:08:09,723 --> 01:08:10,808
But to get the diamonds out

819
01:08:10,891 --> 01:08:13,477
they must have penetrated
it somewhere.

820
01:08:13,561 --> 01:08:15,229
No forced entry.

821
01:08:15,312 --> 01:08:16,814
They knew
the combination.

822
01:08:18,065 --> 01:08:20,401
So, all things
considered, Mr. Finch,

823
01:08:20,401 --> 01:08:23,320
what conclusions
have you arrived at?

824
01:08:23,404 --> 01:08:25,739
Isn't it obvious what conclusions
I've arrived at, Miss Quinn?

825
01:08:25,823 --> 01:08:28,075
A woman of your intelligence
must surely have guessed.

826
01:08:31,745 --> 01:08:34,665
2:00, I believe
we're expected upstairs.

827
01:08:54,935 --> 01:08:58,522
A stop gap to restore diamond
inventories to an acceptable level.

828
01:09:00,441 --> 01:09:02,693
Five million pounds.

829
01:09:02,776 --> 01:09:04,778
That is what you've
come up with, eh?

830
01:09:04,778 --> 01:09:06,363
Financing the stones
is impossible.

831
01:09:06,447 --> 01:09:09,033
You control all the major
trading centers across the planet.

832
01:09:09,116 --> 01:09:10,868
When the first
diamond turns up,

833
01:09:10,951 --> 01:09:12,703
within hours
you'll get the rest.

834
01:09:12,786 --> 01:09:17,124
Sinclair, we are the sole supplier
of diamonds to six continents.

835
01:09:17,124 --> 01:09:20,961
Any hint we can no longer
supply would be catastrophic.

836
01:09:21,045 --> 01:09:24,631
Money is no substitute
for diamonds.

837
01:09:24,715 --> 01:09:26,133
Miss Quinn is here
with Mr. Finch, sir.

838
01:09:26,216 --> 01:09:28,218
Well, paying the ransom
won't guarantee

839
01:09:28,302 --> 01:09:30,220
your diamonds back and will
make it more difficult

840
01:09:30,304 --> 01:09:32,139
to apprehend
those responsible.

841
01:09:32,222 --> 01:09:35,309
That is your problem,
not mine.

842
01:09:35,392 --> 01:09:36,477
Now, Mr. Finch.

843
01:09:36,560 --> 01:09:38,395
I believe Mr. Finch
has got something

844
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:42,066
to tell us which may
alter all our perspectives.

845
01:09:43,317 --> 01:09:45,486
I am now in no doubt that
the crime was perpetrated

846
01:09:45,569 --> 01:09:48,822
by either one or a number
of London Diamond employees.

847
01:09:48,906 --> 01:09:51,158
I believe also that
the perpetrator obtained

848
01:09:51,241 --> 01:09:52,993
the codes to the vault
from Sir Milton's residence,

849
01:09:52,993 --> 01:09:55,829
most likely on the evening of
last Saturday during a party.

850
01:09:55,913 --> 01:09:58,749
A team has been sent over to
the house to dust for prints.

851
01:09:58,832 --> 01:10:01,668
Mr. Finch, you said
that you deemed

852
01:10:01,752 --> 01:10:03,754
the motive for the
robbery to be political.

853
01:10:03,837 --> 01:10:05,839
Were it a crime for profit,

854
01:10:05,923 --> 01:10:07,508
a single handful
of diamonds would do.

855
01:10:07,591 --> 01:10:09,176
Now, Mr. Finch,
in your opinion,

856
01:10:09,259 --> 01:10:12,262
who are the most likely
political factions?

857
01:10:12,346 --> 01:10:14,765
The Soviets and the South
African rebels would top the list.

858
01:10:14,848 --> 01:10:17,434
And are there any
members of personnel

859
01:10:17,518 --> 01:10:19,770
in London Diamond
who might be associated

860
01:10:19,853 --> 01:10:22,773
with, uh, these
political factions?

861
01:10:22,856 --> 01:10:27,528
Well, there was one name
that came to the surface.

862
01:10:28,612 --> 01:10:29,530
Ahem.

863
01:10:30,781 --> 01:10:33,951
Oliver Ashtoncroft, age
20, arrested at Oxford

864
01:10:34,034 --> 01:10:37,371
whilst attending a
Marxist Leninist rally.

865
01:10:37,454 --> 01:10:38,705
But this is ridiculous.

866
01:10:38,789 --> 01:10:40,374
That was nearly
two decades ago.

867
01:10:40,457 --> 01:10:41,792
Just because I don't
advocate everything

868
01:10:41,875 --> 01:10:42,876
that goes on
at this company

869
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:45,212
does not make me
a communist or a thief.

870
01:10:45,295 --> 01:10:46,713
That is enough!

871
01:10:48,882 --> 01:10:52,136
You really have sunk
to the dregs this time, eh?

872
01:10:52,219 --> 01:10:55,222
Well, I'm sorry,
but unless we can remove

873
01:10:55,222 --> 01:10:57,307
even the slightest
hint of fraud,

874
01:10:57,391 --> 01:11:00,727
King's Row will not even
consider full settlement.

875
01:11:00,811 --> 01:11:04,398
Sinclair, as the syndicate's
largest underwriter,

876
01:11:04,481 --> 01:11:08,902
you stand to lose a great deal
of your ill gotten fortune.

877
01:11:08,986 --> 01:11:10,320
Or do I overstate?

878
01:11:10,404 --> 01:11:13,156
Ill gotten? Well,
now that is rich,

879
01:11:13,240 --> 01:11:17,160
coming from a de facto dictator
of an entire slave nation.

880
01:11:17,244 --> 01:11:19,246
For 30 years
we have paid you

881
01:11:19,329 --> 01:11:23,208
inordinate sums of money
for your security.

882
01:11:23,333 --> 01:11:25,502
We have done so
in the hope that one day

883
01:11:25,586 --> 01:11:27,963
we may receive
something in return.

884
01:11:28,088 --> 01:11:31,258
Well, that day has come,
Sinclair, and what, eh?

885
01:11:31,341 --> 01:11:32,593
Nothing.

886
01:11:32,634 --> 01:11:35,220
I will crush you, Sinclair.

887
01:11:35,262 --> 01:11:37,598
I will take
everything you have.

888
01:11:37,681 --> 01:11:40,767
And then I will piss
on your fucking grave.

889
01:11:54,448 --> 01:11:56,950
How'd you do it, Mr. Hobbs?
How'd you get them out?

890
01:11:56,950 --> 01:11:58,952
Do you know what the hardest
substance in the world is?

891
01:11:59,036 --> 01:12:00,537
And who's really
behind this?

892
01:12:00,621 --> 01:12:01,788
The diamond.

893
01:12:01,788 --> 01:12:03,874
You rub it with a cloth,
it lets off a charge.

894
01:12:03,915 --> 01:12:06,793
You put it in water,
it comes up dry.

895
01:12:06,877 --> 01:12:09,296
Its only enemy
is another diamond.

896
01:12:09,296 --> 01:12:11,048
You do know you've rendered
the stones worthless?

897
01:12:11,131 --> 01:12:13,634
All of them.
They can't be sold.

898
01:12:13,717 --> 01:12:15,886
London Diamond's
the only buyer on earth.

899
01:12:15,927 --> 01:12:16,928
Precisely!

900
01:12:16,970 --> 01:12:19,306
And to that end
we have demanded a ransom.

901
01:12:19,306 --> 01:12:20,974
We? No,
there is no "we."

902
01:12:21,099 --> 01:12:22,643
They won't pay.

903
01:12:22,643 --> 01:12:24,061
They couldn't
if they wanted.

904
01:12:24,144 --> 01:12:25,729
There's no money.

905
01:12:25,771 --> 01:12:28,357
And that investigator finch,
he saw us talking.

906
01:12:28,398 --> 01:12:29,941
He will find out.

907
01:12:29,941 --> 01:12:31,526
I have absolutely
no doubt.

908
01:12:31,652 --> 01:12:33,737
Have you ever thought
about your plans, like?

909
01:12:33,820 --> 01:12:35,572
No, I mean,
when you get your share,

910
01:12:35,656 --> 01:12:37,491
what you gonna
do with your life.

911
01:12:37,491 --> 01:12:40,327
I mean, are you gonna
be a giver or a taker?

912
01:12:40,369 --> 01:12:42,579
Why, you stupid,
old man!

913
01:12:42,663 --> 01:12:45,582
Wake up!
Don't you understand?

914
01:12:45,624 --> 01:12:49,086
That the only life for us
is one behind bars.

915
01:12:49,169 --> 01:12:51,004
Ok, look.

916
01:12:52,172 --> 01:12:54,466
I can negotiate
our way out of this.

917
01:12:54,591 --> 01:12:55,675
I'll go to Ashtoncroft.

918
01:12:55,759 --> 01:12:57,052
Offer him the diamonds
in exchange

919
01:12:57,177 --> 01:12:59,137
for our freedom
and our silence.

920
01:12:59,179 --> 01:13:01,098
He'll... he'll
accept the deal.

921
01:13:01,181 --> 01:13:03,683
His terror of publicity
will see to it.

922
01:13:03,809 --> 01:13:05,519
All you have to do is tell
me where the diamonds are.

923
01:13:05,602 --> 01:13:07,187
I'm... I'm sorry,
Miss Quinn.

924
01:13:07,270 --> 01:13:11,650
I... I'd like to help, but
I do not intend to negotiate.

925
01:13:11,775 --> 01:13:14,194
Well, then I have no option
but to turn myself in.

926
01:13:14,277 --> 01:13:15,195
Oh, really?

927
01:13:15,320 --> 01:13:17,030
Is that what you're
gonna do, eh?

928
01:13:17,114 --> 01:13:18,949
After all these years
clawing your way up,

929
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:21,368
laughing at men's jokes,

930
01:13:21,451 --> 01:13:25,372
subservient, neglecting
your opportunities,

931
01:13:25,455 --> 01:13:27,207
giving up on love,

932
01:13:27,290 --> 01:13:29,793
no time for the simple,
the decent.

933
01:13:29,876 --> 01:13:31,503
Doing all the dirty work,

934
01:13:31,545 --> 01:13:36,550
you're really going to throw
all that away just to spite me?

935
01:13:36,675 --> 01:13:38,718
I require the money in full.

936
01:13:38,760 --> 01:13:41,054
And yes, they can pay it.

937
01:13:41,138 --> 01:13:44,391
It is precisely what
they are insured for.

938
01:13:44,474 --> 01:13:45,392
As you wish.

939
01:13:45,475 --> 01:13:47,227
Then I shall find
the diamonds myself.

940
01:13:47,310 --> 01:13:49,229
Oh, is that a fact?
Oh, it certainly is.

941
01:13:49,312 --> 01:13:50,564
I shall find the diamonds.

942
01:13:50,647 --> 01:13:51,857
Make no mistake
about it.

943
01:14:05,245 --> 01:14:06,413
Is this a bad time?

944
01:14:06,454 --> 01:14:08,415
No, no, not at all.

945
01:14:08,498 --> 01:14:10,417
It's just a formality,
you understand?

946
01:14:10,542 --> 01:14:12,919
And we have requested
the same from all employees

947
01:14:13,003 --> 01:14:16,006
who were present
a Sir Milton's party.

948
01:14:16,089 --> 01:14:18,008
A set of fingerprints?

949
01:14:18,091 --> 01:14:19,009
Of course.

950
01:14:20,093 --> 01:14:22,053
May I?

951
01:14:22,053 --> 01:14:23,680
There's really
nothing to worry about.

952
01:14:23,763 --> 01:14:27,225
It's simply to rule you out
conclusively from our investigations.

953
01:14:30,395 --> 01:14:32,272
Sorry, it's quite
warm in here.

954
01:14:32,272 --> 01:14:33,690
Isn't it?

955
01:14:33,773 --> 01:14:35,567
Now, if you'll
allow me.

956
01:14:40,447 --> 01:14:43,533
Are you really considering
Ollie to be your prime suspect?

957
01:14:43,617 --> 01:14:45,201
What? Mmm.

958
01:14:45,285 --> 01:14:50,040
Wouldn't you say he had the greatest
facility to obtain the codes?

959
01:14:50,123 --> 01:14:52,542
But does
he have the courage?

960
01:14:52,626 --> 01:14:56,922
The requisite spine
of ambition?

961
01:14:56,963 --> 01:15:00,383
It's hard to imagine anyone
capable of so audacious a crime.

962
01:15:00,467 --> 01:15:03,970
Audacious
or just ambitious?

963
01:15:05,221 --> 01:15:08,558
Ambition is something you
understand, Miss Quinn.

964
01:15:11,061 --> 01:15:13,980
No longer married,
Mr. Finch?

965
01:15:17,067 --> 01:15:19,152
No, I'm not.

966
01:15:19,235 --> 01:15:21,988
She tire of all
your investigating?

967
01:15:22,072 --> 01:15:24,324
Yes, she did.

968
01:15:25,241 --> 01:15:26,826
I'm sorry.

969
01:15:31,998 --> 01:15:33,333
Here.

970
01:15:37,629 --> 01:15:39,005
Thank you.

971
01:15:39,089 --> 01:15:43,677
Oh, and just one
last thing, Miss Quinn.

972
01:15:43,760 --> 01:15:45,679
I need your assistance
downstairs.

973
01:15:45,762 --> 01:15:48,181
Could you? It's just
a matter of a few minutes.

974
01:15:48,264 --> 01:15:49,516
Certainly.

975
01:15:54,312 --> 01:15:58,441
Now, I want you to tell me
in your opinion, Miss Quinn,

976
01:15:58,483 --> 01:16:00,860
if this man is lying.

977
01:16:05,865 --> 01:16:08,701
Mr. Hobbs, I believe
you know Miss Quinn.

978
01:16:08,785 --> 01:16:12,705
Uh, third floor, second
office from the lift, yes.

979
01:16:12,789 --> 01:16:15,041
She's been kind enough to
act as my second set of ears.

980
01:16:16,209 --> 01:16:18,545
Uh, are we still discussing
Tuesday night, sir?

981
01:16:21,631 --> 01:16:24,384
I would like to revisit
the period

982
01:16:24,509 --> 01:16:29,889
in the sub basement
from 3-6:00 a.m.

983
01:16:29,889 --> 01:16:31,349
Three hours.

984
01:16:31,391 --> 01:16:34,727
The bulk of which
is unaccounted for.

985
01:16:34,727 --> 01:16:38,898
The nature of my job,
sir, is somewhat solitary.

986
01:16:38,898 --> 01:16:40,733
Now, you stated earlier

987
01:16:40,733 --> 01:16:44,737
these hours were spent
waxing and polishing floors.

988
01:16:44,821 --> 01:16:45,905
Yeah, mostly. Yeah.

989
01:16:45,947 --> 01:16:47,031
That's a great deal of time

990
01:16:47,073 --> 01:16:48,408
devoted to polishing floors.

991
01:16:48,408 --> 01:16:50,160
Oh, marble is very
particular, sir.

992
01:16:50,243 --> 01:16:53,788
It requires a certain type of
polish and a lot of time to set.

993
01:16:55,290 --> 01:16:57,917
At what time did you tend
to the vault corridor?

994
01:16:57,917 --> 01:16:59,252
At the very end.

995
01:16:59,252 --> 01:17:00,545
Between 5 and
6:00 A.M.?

996
01:17:00,587 --> 01:17:02,422
Yes.

997
01:17:02,422 --> 01:17:03,423
Why then?

998
01:17:03,506 --> 01:17:05,258
Why wait until the end?

999
01:17:05,341 --> 01:17:07,594
Oh, it's... it's
a cherished task.

1000
01:17:07,677 --> 01:17:11,764
It's akin to tending the
palace throne, I imagine.

1001
01:17:13,057 --> 01:17:14,934
I always save
the best till last.

1002
01:17:14,934 --> 01:17:16,019
Hmm.

1003
01:17:17,729 --> 01:17:20,273
Any hobbies, Mr. Hobbs,

1004
01:17:20,356 --> 01:17:21,774
leisure time activities?

1005
01:17:21,858 --> 01:17:24,569
Yes, I... I read a good
book now and then.

1006
01:17:24,611 --> 01:17:25,862
Anything in particular?

1007
01:17:25,945 --> 01:17:28,865
Graham Greene,
uh, H.G. Wells,

1008
01:17:28,948 --> 01:17:31,451
sometimes
Emily Dickinson.

1009
01:17:31,534 --> 01:17:33,119
Nothing more radical?

1010
01:17:33,203 --> 01:17:36,956
No Soviet literature in your
collection, Mr. Hobbs?

1011
01:17:37,040 --> 01:17:38,875
Oh, I... I tried
War and Peace,

1012
01:17:38,958 --> 01:17:40,043
but I couldn't
finish it.

1013
01:17:42,462 --> 01:17:44,339
You frequent
Greyhound races.

1014
01:17:44,464 --> 01:17:47,217
You like to watch dogs run
around in circles?

1015
01:17:47,300 --> 01:17:49,969
And I also wash
my smalls on Thursdays,

1016
01:17:50,053 --> 01:17:52,305
if you're interested.

1017
01:17:54,140 --> 01:17:58,811
Now, I see your wife died
some years back of cancer.

1018
01:17:58,895 --> 01:18:00,229
Her name was...

1019
01:18:00,313 --> 01:18:01,230
Margaret.

1020
01:18:01,314 --> 01:18:02,398
That's right.

1021
01:18:02,482 --> 01:18:04,692
It must have been
excruciating for you.

1022
01:18:04,817 --> 01:18:07,654
Sitting by, watching her
wither away.

1023
01:18:07,654 --> 01:18:10,365
Taken in
the very prime of life.

1024
01:18:10,406 --> 01:18:13,660
Mr. Finch, you sound like
a man who's lost something.

1025
01:18:13,743 --> 01:18:15,828
Perhaps if you were
to tell me what it was,

1026
01:18:15,828 --> 01:18:16,996
I could help
you locate it.

1027
01:18:19,749 --> 01:18:21,334
Mr. Finch?
Yes?

1028
01:18:21,417 --> 01:18:24,170
We have something
that may be of interest.

1029
01:18:28,424 --> 01:18:29,509
Excuse me.

1030
01:18:31,511 --> 01:18:32,929
Come on.

1031
01:18:38,184 --> 01:18:40,269
That'll be all
for now, Mr. Hobbs.

1032
01:18:40,353 --> 01:18:42,689
I will see you later,
Miss Quinn.

1033
01:18:48,695 --> 01:18:51,197
In Ashtoncroft's study
I used a handkerchief,

1034
01:18:51,280 --> 01:18:52,198
but in the heat
of the moment

1035
01:18:52,281 --> 01:18:53,866
I may have left
a fingerprint.

1036
01:18:53,950 --> 01:18:55,618
I know why you did this.

1037
01:18:55,702 --> 01:18:57,537
I know it's not
about the money.

1038
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:59,622
Nothing important ever is.

1039
01:19:00,957 --> 01:19:03,376
I understand you have
political convictions,

1040
01:19:03,459 --> 01:19:07,380
but you have to know King's Row
is trying every tactic not to pay.

1041
01:19:07,463 --> 01:19:09,841
And I have a feeling
they're going to succeed.

1042
01:19:09,841 --> 01:19:12,969
Our only way out of this
is to negotiate.

1043
01:19:13,010 --> 01:19:15,722
They'll never find
the diamonds then.

1044
01:19:15,805 --> 01:19:17,140
You'll get nothing.

1045
01:19:17,181 --> 01:19:20,268
Absolutely nothing, just
a lifetime in jail.

1046
01:19:20,393 --> 01:19:22,478
Is this cause
of yours worth it?

1047
01:19:22,562 --> 01:19:24,647
I mean, would the cause
do the same for you?

1048
01:19:26,023 --> 01:19:28,651
This time tomorrow morning
this will all be over.

1049
01:19:28,735 --> 01:19:32,488
What's that old phrase about
two wrongs a right do not make?

1050
01:19:32,572 --> 01:19:33,990
That's nonsense.

1051
01:19:34,073 --> 01:19:35,992
Sometimes to make
something right

1052
01:19:36,075 --> 01:19:39,036
you have to do
something just as wrong.

1053
01:19:39,078 --> 01:19:43,207
Oh, get... oh, yes, my cause.

1054
01:19:43,207 --> 01:19:49,338
It's worth a 100 lifetimes
in jail for me, Miss Quinn.

1055
01:19:49,422 --> 01:19:51,340
Some day you will understand.

1056
01:19:51,424 --> 01:19:57,013
Maybe it will inspire you to
look beyond these marble walls.

1057
01:19:57,096 --> 01:19:59,015
There's a remarkable
world out there.

1058
01:20:01,767 --> 01:20:04,187
Oh, and if it's
any consolation,

1059
01:20:04,270 --> 01:20:07,190
I never really
intended to involve you.

1060
01:20:29,962 --> 01:20:31,714
Get the forensic
department to verify it.

1061
01:20:31,797 --> 01:20:33,049
Yes, sir.

1062
01:20:33,132 --> 01:20:34,383
How about the dog track?
Anything?

1063
01:20:34,467 --> 01:20:35,885
Yes, um...

1064
01:20:37,720 --> 01:20:39,055
this one here.

1065
01:20:39,138 --> 01:20:43,059
I'm pretty certain that's him,
sir, the janitor.

1066
01:21:20,429 --> 01:21:21,597
Christ, Hobbs!

1067
01:21:21,681 --> 01:21:23,808
How did you do it?

1068
01:21:25,434 --> 01:21:28,187
I'm telling you.
We have no more time.

1069
01:21:28,270 --> 01:21:30,648
Taking on Ashtoncroft
when his back is to the wall

1070
01:21:30,690 --> 01:21:31,774
will lead to a blood bath.

1071
01:21:31,857 --> 01:21:34,819
Someone's going
to be ruined.

1072
01:21:34,860 --> 01:21:36,362
And what about finch?

1073
01:21:36,445 --> 01:21:38,030
He says he has
some leads.

1074
01:21:38,114 --> 01:21:39,865
I don't think
we can rely on him.

1075
01:21:39,991 --> 01:21:41,784
We don't
have any choice.

1076
01:21:41,867 --> 01:21:45,037
Make sure that he comes up
with something, and quickly.

1077
01:21:46,455 --> 01:21:50,042
What the hell do you think
I have been doing?

1078
01:21:55,965 --> 01:21:57,883
Contact
the syndicate members.

1079
01:21:57,967 --> 01:21:59,760
All of them.

1080
01:21:59,802 --> 01:22:01,721
Convene a meeting
tonight.

1081
01:22:01,846 --> 01:22:03,222
And tell them
what?

1082
01:22:04,807 --> 01:22:06,058
Tell them...

1083
01:22:07,643 --> 01:22:09,812
tell them...

1084
01:22:11,063 --> 01:22:12,356
Tell them if
they do not come here

1085
01:22:12,398 --> 01:22:14,900
with their wallets open
to pay me everything

1086
01:22:14,984 --> 01:22:19,238
they owe me, I will dedicate
my remaining years

1087
01:22:19,321 --> 01:22:24,577
on this earth to ruining
every last one of them.

1088
01:22:27,747 --> 01:22:29,749
Tell them that.

1089
01:22:29,832 --> 01:22:31,083
Word for word.

1090
01:22:57,359 --> 01:23:00,446
London Evening News.

1091
01:23:00,446 --> 01:23:02,406
Put me through
to the news desk, please.

1092
01:23:10,539 --> 01:23:12,374
I was looking for you.

1093
01:23:12,458 --> 01:23:14,335
I need some air.

1094
01:23:14,460 --> 01:23:15,628
Will you have
a drink with me?

1095
01:23:37,650 --> 01:23:39,235
You know you're quite
someone, Miss Quinn.

1096
01:23:40,653 --> 01:23:42,655
A true maverick.

1097
01:23:43,822 --> 01:23:46,700
Why was it again
no one married you?

1098
01:23:46,825 --> 01:23:50,829
My mother said, "beating the boys
won't make you popular or happy."

1099
01:23:50,913 --> 01:23:52,373
It turns out
she was right.

1100
01:23:55,167 --> 01:23:59,171
We're the same, you and I,
outsiders, loners.

1101
01:23:59,213 --> 01:24:02,591
We could almost be brilliant.

1102
01:24:02,675 --> 01:24:05,427
But what would we achieve
with all the hours we put in?

1103
01:24:06,845 --> 01:24:08,055
Absolutely nothing.

1104
01:24:13,102 --> 01:24:14,812
Anything else, sir?

1105
01:24:14,812 --> 01:24:16,188
Come in.

1106
01:24:17,481 --> 01:24:19,566
Sir, the press
are outside.

1107
01:24:19,692 --> 01:24:20,693
The press?

1108
01:24:20,693 --> 01:24:21,652
What do they want?

1109
01:24:21,777 --> 01:24:23,153
I'm not sure, sir.

1110
01:24:24,738 --> 01:24:25,948
I'll speak to them.

1111
01:24:39,336 --> 01:24:42,506
Ladies and gentlemen,
please.

1112
01:24:42,631 --> 01:24:45,884
Mr. Milton Ashtoncroft is
not available at the moment.

1113
01:25:12,077 --> 01:25:14,788
So, Miss Quinn...

1114
01:25:16,248 --> 01:25:17,916
are you going
to tell me how you did it?

1115
01:25:19,752 --> 01:25:23,839
Remove 100 million pounds
of diamonds past cameras,

1116
01:25:23,922 --> 01:25:28,177
walls of steel and security
guards and sealed doorways?

1117
01:25:28,260 --> 01:25:30,095
For the life of me
I can't unravel it.

1118
01:25:31,764 --> 01:25:35,100
I wish I could help you, but
I'm really not that clever.

1119
01:25:35,142 --> 01:25:36,769
Maybe you struck a deal
with the Russians.

1120
01:25:36,852 --> 01:25:37,853
Who knows?

1121
01:25:39,104 --> 01:25:40,105
You could look
after their new cartel

1122
01:25:40,105 --> 01:25:42,024
once Lon Di
hits the scrap heap.

1123
01:25:42,107 --> 01:25:44,109
Do I appear
so diabolical?

1124
01:25:49,448 --> 01:25:52,701
We've seen a photo of you at
the racetrack with Mr. Hobbs.

1125
01:25:52,785 --> 01:25:54,912
You must be mistaken.
I never gamble.

1126
01:25:54,912 --> 01:25:59,875
We also found some fingerprints
at the Ashtoncroft Mansion.

1127
01:25:59,958 --> 01:26:03,295
By midnight we shall
have conclusive results.

1128
01:26:05,130 --> 01:26:07,716
Oh, and, um...

1129
01:26:09,134 --> 01:26:12,888
did you know my fee is five
percent of recovered goods?

1130
01:26:12,971 --> 01:26:15,766
I understand what you're
doing, Mr. Finch.

1131
01:26:15,766 --> 01:26:17,142
You're testing me,

1132
01:26:17,226 --> 01:26:20,646
measuring my reactions,
my stimulus responses.

1133
01:26:20,729 --> 01:26:23,815
But the truth is you
haven't arrested me

1134
01:26:23,815 --> 01:26:25,317
because you
have no evidence.

1135
01:26:25,400 --> 01:26:27,236
Because I've
committed no crime.

1136
01:26:27,277 --> 01:26:30,155
Perhaps I haven't arrested you
because I'm waiting for you

1137
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:32,449
to reveal who's
really behind all this.

1138
01:26:33,742 --> 01:26:36,995
Sir, there's been
an incident.

1139
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:39,164
News of the robbery
has leaked to the press.

1140
01:26:39,206 --> 01:26:41,166
Mr. Ashtoncroft
has had a heart attack.

1141
01:26:41,291 --> 01:26:42,668
Is... is he all right?

1142
01:26:42,668 --> 01:26:44,169
I'm afraid not, madame.

1143
01:26:44,253 --> 01:26:46,672
The board are reconvening
back at the office.

1144
01:26:49,925 --> 01:26:52,427
I hope you have no intentions
of leaving town, Miss Quinn.

1145
01:27:27,879 --> 01:27:28,797
Shit.

1146
01:27:37,723 --> 01:27:38,682
Ohh.

1147
01:29:49,271 --> 01:29:51,022
Aren't you a picture?

1148
01:29:55,193 --> 01:29:57,112
Clever girl, eh?

1149
01:29:57,195 --> 01:29:59,990
Filthy, but clever.

1150
01:30:00,115 --> 01:30:02,117
Ashtoncroft's dead,

1151
01:30:02,200 --> 01:30:05,704
or was that all a part
of your plan, Mr. Hobbs?

1152
01:30:05,745 --> 01:30:08,206
I'm going back and
telling them everything.

1153
01:30:08,290 --> 01:30:10,709
I'm afraid I can't
let you go, Miss Quinn.

1154
01:30:10,792 --> 01:30:15,880
You see, the deadline for
the ransom's in about an hour

1155
01:30:15,964 --> 01:30:19,551
and I'm guarding
the entrance to Aladdin's Cave

1156
01:30:19,634 --> 01:30:22,721
in case someone's smart
enough to figure it out.

1157
01:30:22,804 --> 01:30:24,306
Look at you.

1158
01:30:26,975 --> 01:30:28,560
You're quite an asset
to the company.

1159
01:30:28,643 --> 01:30:30,186
Aren't you, Miss Quinn?

1160
01:30:30,312 --> 01:30:32,856
They're not going to pay and
you're insane to think they would!

1161
01:30:32,981 --> 01:30:34,899
Oh, they will.
I'm sure of that.

1162
01:30:34,941 --> 01:30:37,736
Ever think what you're going
to do when all of this is over?

1163
01:30:52,417 --> 01:30:54,210
Ugh! Ugh!

1164
01:31:02,010 --> 01:31:05,513
You know, you remind me
so much of my wife.

1165
01:31:08,183 --> 01:31:10,685
Once she got her teeth
into something.

1166
01:31:12,937 --> 01:31:14,481
Did I ever tell
you how she died?

1167
01:31:14,522 --> 01:31:15,857
Cancer.

1168
01:31:17,275 --> 01:31:21,529
But first, they said that not
only was her cancer operable,

1169
01:31:21,613 --> 01:31:24,949
but it had been caught early
and she had an excellent chance.

1170
01:31:24,949 --> 01:31:27,535
But you see, we paid
what little money

1171
01:31:27,619 --> 01:31:31,039
we had into a private
hospital policy.

1172
01:31:31,122 --> 01:31:35,210
But then the insurance
company told her

1173
01:31:35,293 --> 01:31:39,380
that she had to wait her
turn for a stay in hospital.

1174
01:31:39,464 --> 01:31:42,467
So we pleaded
our case all the way

1175
01:31:42,550 --> 01:31:45,553
up to the Chairman
of the company.

1176
01:31:45,637 --> 01:31:48,723
But he said
it wasn't an emergency.

1177
01:31:50,558 --> 01:31:52,644
So, you know...

1178
01:31:52,727 --> 01:31:57,065
but by the time she was
admitted to the hospital,

1179
01:31:57,148 --> 01:32:02,570
well, it... it was... she
was too far gone then.

1180
01:32:02,654 --> 01:32:04,405
It's Sinclair.

1181
01:32:04,489 --> 01:32:06,574
Yeah.

1182
01:32:06,658 --> 01:32:10,161
At that time Clifton Sinclair
was the biggest seller

1183
01:32:10,245 --> 01:32:14,833
of private hospital policies
to the British underprivileged.

1184
01:32:14,916 --> 01:32:17,669
And he used that money
to establish himself...

1185
01:32:17,752 --> 01:32:21,172
as London Diamond's largest
insurance underwriter.

1186
01:32:21,256 --> 01:32:25,844
Individual participants
in King's Row syndicates

1187
01:32:25,927 --> 01:32:32,100
are liable to the full extent
of their private wealth.

1188
01:32:33,268 --> 01:32:36,187
What is the meaning of this?

1189
01:32:36,271 --> 01:32:37,939
What the hell
are you doing here?

1190
01:32:38,022 --> 01:32:39,274
We've been discussing
the situation.

1191
01:32:39,357 --> 01:32:40,608
What situation?

1192
01:32:40,692 --> 01:32:41,693
The impossible situation
that you got us all into.

1193
01:32:41,776 --> 01:32:42,777
What are you talking about?

1194
01:32:42,861 --> 01:32:44,028
In case you didn't know,

1195
01:32:44,112 --> 01:32:46,030
we own 75 percent
of the London Evening News.

1196
01:32:46,114 --> 01:32:48,032
I believe you spoke
with them earlier.

1197
01:32:48,116 --> 01:32:49,284
Yes.
Going to the press means

1198
01:32:49,367 --> 01:32:51,536
you don't have to come
up with a quick settlement.

1199
01:32:51,619 --> 01:32:55,874
The scandalous news, your time is
bought, that was the plan, wasn't it?

1200
01:32:55,874 --> 01:32:59,043
Mr. Ashtoncroft has, however,
agreed to dismiss all charges

1201
01:32:59,127 --> 01:33:02,213
pending an immediate
settlement of the claim

1202
01:33:02,297 --> 01:33:03,881
which I have
just authorized.

1203
01:33:03,881 --> 01:33:05,550
You have what?

1204
01:33:05,633 --> 01:33:07,719
King's Row
signifies one thing.

1205
01:33:07,802 --> 01:33:09,470
Reliability.
Now just...

1206
01:33:09,554 --> 01:33:10,722
our business
was built on it.

1207
01:33:10,722 --> 01:33:11,723
Our reputation
demands it.

1208
01:33:11,723 --> 01:33:13,891
You will never ever
get the money back!

1209
01:33:13,975 --> 01:33:16,644
It's for a ransom,
for Christ's sake!

1210
01:33:16,728 --> 01:33:22,817
Are you telling me you waited 15
years for the absolute right moment?

1211
01:33:22,900 --> 01:33:25,069
All this
to punish one man?

1212
01:33:25,153 --> 01:33:29,073
Patience, they say,
is a virtue.

1213
01:33:34,746 --> 01:33:37,081
He took from me...

1214
01:33:37,081 --> 01:33:42,003
the one thing in this world
that I truly loved.

1215
01:33:43,588 --> 01:33:48,259
Mr. Hobbs,
you have so much valor.

1216
01:33:50,678 --> 01:33:51,763
No.

1217
01:33:55,933 --> 01:33:57,268
Didn't we?

1218
01:34:16,120 --> 01:34:17,622
How did you solve it?

1219
01:34:17,622 --> 01:34:21,459
My clumsiness and
your background.

1220
01:34:48,653 --> 01:34:50,488
Come on, come on.

1221
01:34:50,571 --> 01:34:51,906
Here it is, sir.

1222
01:34:51,989 --> 01:34:53,407
Thank you.

1223
01:34:54,992 --> 01:34:57,662
This is the telex from the bank
confirming that the deposit

1224
01:34:57,745 --> 01:34:59,831
has been made corresponding
to the exact amount

1225
01:34:59,914 --> 01:35:02,083
as requested
by your client.

1226
01:35:02,166 --> 01:35:03,584
Everything looks
to be in order.

1227
01:35:26,774 --> 01:35:28,192
Ugh!

1228
01:35:41,706 --> 01:35:43,541
Look at the
inventory list

1229
01:35:48,462 --> 01:35:49,797
what does it say?

1230
01:35:51,966 --> 01:35:53,134
Would you call
security, please?

1231
01:35:56,637 --> 01:35:57,722
I don't understand.

1232
01:35:57,722 --> 01:35:58,723
Blank!

1233
01:35:58,806 --> 01:36:00,558
What the hell is
that supposed to mean?

1234
01:36:00,641 --> 01:36:03,728
I believe it means the
diamonds are not being returned.

1235
01:36:50,608 --> 01:36:51,942
Good day.

1236
01:37:25,726 --> 01:37:28,396
The South African Star,
so it wasn't a message?

1237
01:37:28,479 --> 01:37:29,563
Shh, shh.
More complicated.

1238
01:37:36,737 --> 01:37:38,155
Would you mind?

1239
01:37:38,239 --> 01:37:40,658
I'll, uh,
leave you to it.

1240
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:09,770
My client will then convey where
you may take possession of the goods.

1241
01:38:09,854 --> 01:38:15,025
Excuse me, but there's a call
for Mr. Boyle from his office.

1242
01:38:24,201 --> 01:38:25,536
Yes?

1243
01:38:27,037 --> 01:38:29,039
Has there
been a delivery?

1244
01:38:37,882 --> 01:38:40,885
May I give you
some advice, Miss Quinn?

1245
01:38:40,885 --> 01:38:43,387
Well, you are the one
holding the gun.

1246
01:38:43,470 --> 01:38:45,890
Life is for living.

1247
01:38:45,890 --> 01:38:48,392
It's there for the taking.

1248
01:38:48,392 --> 01:38:50,227
Grant yourself no regrets.

1249
01:38:50,227 --> 01:38:51,729
Go on, put it down.

1250
01:38:51,729 --> 01:38:53,314
You don't have
it in you.

1251
01:38:58,402 --> 01:38:59,987
It was never loaded.

1252
01:39:03,073 --> 01:39:04,742
It doesn't matter now.

1253
01:39:06,076 --> 01:39:07,244
All done.

1254
01:39:47,618 --> 01:39:48,535
How many more?

1255
01:39:48,619 --> 01:39:49,703
Steady.

1256
01:39:55,459 --> 01:39:56,543
Steady with that.

1257
01:40:01,465 --> 01:40:03,634
Mr. Hopkins.

1258
01:40:03,634 --> 01:40:04,635
Miss Quinn.

1259
01:40:06,637 --> 01:40:08,555
Mr. Finch.

1260
01:40:13,894 --> 01:40:16,397
Congratulations.

1261
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:18,232
The idea came
when you were dropping

1262
01:40:18,315 --> 01:40:19,900
your earring in the sink,
is it right?

1263
01:40:21,652 --> 01:40:24,071
Sorry I lost you
your finder's fee.

1264
01:40:27,658 --> 01:40:29,493
We didn't find prints
on Sir Milton's safe.

1265
01:40:30,994 --> 01:40:33,747
We found them on the opera
glasses in his office.

1266
01:40:33,831 --> 01:40:35,499
They weren't conclusive.

1267
01:40:37,167 --> 01:40:38,168
Mr. Finch.

1268
01:40:43,674 --> 01:40:47,761
Whatever it is you have
to say, Miss Quinn,

1269
01:40:47,845 --> 01:40:49,263
now is not
the right time to say it.

1270
01:40:51,181 --> 01:40:53,600
Maybe there will never
be a right time.

1271
01:40:58,856 --> 01:41:00,607
As strange as it may sound...

1272
01:41:02,860 --> 01:41:04,278
I can't bare the thought
of you spending

1273
01:41:04,361 --> 01:41:07,114
the rest of your life
behind bars.

1274
01:41:07,197 --> 01:41:11,702
Naturally you'll have to agree
to assist the investigation...

1275
01:41:11,785 --> 01:41:15,539
with your all-round
experience, you are...

1276
01:41:15,622 --> 01:41:17,708
perfectly situated to do so.

1277
01:41:23,881 --> 01:41:25,382
Good-bye, Miss Quinn.

1278
01:41:51,658 --> 01:41:52,910
It has been widely reported

1279
01:41:52,993 --> 01:41:56,246
that a large scale theft has
taken place on these premises.

1280
01:41:56,246 --> 01:41:58,582
As you can see,
that is not the case.

1281
01:42:08,675 --> 01:42:10,260
Ollie took
over the company

1282
01:42:10,260 --> 01:42:12,679
and became everything
his father had ever hoped.

1283
01:42:15,432 --> 01:42:17,434
I was more fortunate.

1284
01:42:17,517 --> 01:42:18,518
We look forward
to a long...

1285
01:42:18,602 --> 01:42:21,021
and prosperous...

1286
01:42:21,104 --> 01:42:22,940
and...

1287
01:42:23,023 --> 01:42:25,025
confidential
relationship.

1288
01:42:25,108 --> 01:42:27,027
After an extensive
investigation,

1289
01:42:27,110 --> 01:42:31,114
it was determined that Mr.
Hobbs had somehow acted alone.

1290
01:42:31,198 --> 01:42:32,866
They never found him.

1291
01:42:32,950 --> 01:42:35,535
A month later I was
passed over again

1292
01:42:35,619 --> 01:42:39,206
and tendered my resignation
the following day.

1293
01:42:54,304 --> 01:42:55,722
Well, forgive me
for being sensational,

1294
01:42:55,806 --> 01:42:56,890
but I really need to know.

1295
01:42:56,974 --> 01:42:58,892
What happened
with the money?

1296
01:42:58,976 --> 01:43:01,561
Mr. Hobbs?

1297
01:43:01,645 --> 01:43:04,815
Well, Mr. Hobbs, though
we never spoke again,

1298
01:43:04,898 --> 01:43:07,401
but I did receive
a letter from a bank

1299
01:43:07,484 --> 01:43:10,487
in Switzerland
informing me a deposit

1300
01:43:10,570 --> 01:43:15,158
had been made to a numbered
account on my behalf.

1301
01:43:15,158 --> 01:43:17,911
The sum of
100 million pounds.

1302
01:43:17,994 --> 01:43:20,330
Everything.

1303
01:43:20,414 --> 01:43:24,334
And that's where
my real story begins.

1304
01:43:24,334 --> 01:43:27,671
Your article it's called
"Women Who Led."

1305
01:43:27,754 --> 01:43:28,672
That's right, isn't it?

1306
01:43:32,426 --> 01:43:34,845
I hope you're inspired.

1307
01:43:34,928 --> 01:43:38,348
I hope you can
inspire others.

1308
01:43:38,432 --> 01:43:39,766
You can contact me.

1309
01:43:39,850 --> 01:43:41,935
My details are
on the back.

1310
01:43:55,198 --> 01:43:58,034
"I never intended
this to happen,

1311
01:43:58,118 --> 01:44:02,706
"but the burden of Hobbs' money
sent me in a different direction.

1312
01:44:02,706 --> 01:44:04,541
"I discovered the world

1313
01:44:04,541 --> 01:44:07,377
"and through it,
I discovered myself.

1314
01:44:14,050 --> 01:44:17,888
"You'd be surprised how long it
takes to give away 100 million pounds.

1315
01:44:17,971 --> 01:44:19,890
"It's taken me 40 years.

1316
01:44:19,973 --> 01:44:22,726
"And just today...

1317
01:44:22,726 --> 01:44:25,061
"today I gave away
the last penny.

1318
01:44:27,397 --> 01:44:29,900
"I'm free at last.

1319
01:44:36,156 --> 01:44:37,407
"Except...

1320
01:44:37,491 --> 01:44:40,744
"except for that jewel
that you held in your hand,

1321
01:44:42,078 --> 01:44:44,414
"that I've been saving
for a rainy day.

1322
01:44:53,089 --> 01:44:54,925
"Or perhaps...

1323
01:44:56,760 --> 01:44:59,262
"or perhaps it's
the last little piece

1324
01:44:59,262 --> 01:45:03,725
"of vanity that
I have left."
