1
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:12,000
I think she cried at my funeral.

2
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,720
I don't mean to brag about it or anything,

3
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:18,280
but I'm pretty sure she did.

4
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:22,120
Sometimes I can picture her talking about me

5
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,200
to some guy she feels really close to.

6
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,960
You're never going
to see him again, you know?

7
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,560
How they lowered me
into the grave

8
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,840
all pathetic and shriveled up,

9
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,680
like a melted chocolate bar
or something.

10
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:36,600
About how we never
actually got a chance.

11
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:40,080
Then the guy fucks her real nice...

12
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,200
a fuck that's all about
making her feel better.

13
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,000
Soon after I killed myself,

14
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:12,440
I found a job here at Kamikaze Pizza.

15
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:16,000
It's not a great job, but it'll do for a while.

16
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,400
The manager was cool enough

17
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,720
to hook me up with a place to live, too,

18
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,560
with this Austrian guy named Erik.

19
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:28,360
You did it again, Zia.

20
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,800
Did what?

21
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,880
Don't play dumb. You promised.

22
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,840
If you're going to live in this apartment,

23
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,920
you have to sit while you piss.

24
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,840
That. I'm sorry. I forgot.

25
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:41,360
How in the world you forget
something like that?

26
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,000
Sit, sit, sit.

27
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,280
Who could think
of a better punishment, really?

28
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:00,760
Everything's the same here.
It's just a little worse.

29
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,760
I've thought about suicide again,

30
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,880
but I haven't tried it.

31
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,360
I didn't want to end up
in a bigger shit hole than this one.

32
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,360
Yeah, I was missing Desiree.

33
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,640
I even had a feeling
that this whole suicide thing

34
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,200
just made me miss her
and love her more.

35
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,560
But... who knows?

36
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,000
Maybe you just need a drink.

37
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,760
Hi.

38
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:56,760
Listen, my friend Rachel and I,
we play this game

39
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,840
where we try to figure out
how people off themselves.

40
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,800
We were just guessing about you.

41
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,960
How'd you do it?

42
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,360
Three points for me!

43
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:15,840
That's an extremely rude question to ask.

44
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,480
Precisely.

45
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,040
That's what the game's all about.

46
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:21,720
I see. What about you?

47
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,440
Me?

48
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,360
No, no, no, no, no.
Look at him.

49
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,200
He can't stop burping.
It's definitely drowning.

50
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,440
No, I'm telling you,
look at the bluish face.

51
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,760
It's got to be gas.

52
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,000
Go over and ask him.

53
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,640
No. I don't know about this one.

54
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,520
- He seems ill-humored.
- No, no, you got to...

55
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,160
Why don't you try it with me?

56
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,760
Do you know this guy?

57
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,720
I'll bet you girls a beer you won't guess.

58
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:14,160
Tania, look who's here.

59
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,360
We'll be right back.

60
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,640
Right back.

61
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,880
I will tell you something.

62
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:23,200
Whenever a chick says
"I'll be right back,"

63
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,040
write them off, man.

64
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,200
They always end up leaving
with some retarded big-Joe guy.

65
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:35,080
So what was it?

66
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,920
What was what?

67
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,520
How did you, uh,
you know, off yourself?

68
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,640
Oh, that.

69
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:46,120
Let me go, lovely

70
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,200
Let me go

71
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,680
You guys suck!

72
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,960
Suck big time!

73
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,720
Get off the stage!

74
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,160
Fuck it all!

75
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,880
Jesus! Go home, man!

76
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,360
Boo!

77
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,760
You offed with the guitar?

78
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,200
Sure, I did.

79
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:09,640
On stage, man.

80
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,120
It was wild.

81
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,800
Iggy Pop almost came to see that gig.

82
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,720
No way.

83
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,320
It's true.

84
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,480
I live with my parents
and my kid brother Kostya.

85
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,040
You're fucking with me.

86
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:58,480
I'm not fucking with you.

87
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,640
I've never heard of
a whole family here before.

88
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,280
Mom...

89
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,560
offed because she was
missing Russia a lot.

90
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:15,160
And my father, he just didn't feel
like going on without her.

91
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:22,120
But what really did it for him
was my little brother turning out to be gay.

92
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,040
And your kid brother?

93
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:26,160
- Kostya?
- Kostya.

94
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:29,720
I guess he had it in his genes, man.

95
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:35,440
That's the craziest thing
I've ever heard, man.

96
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:38,200
When, uh, Kostya came here,

97
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:41,800
my father...
a man who wouldn't cry...

98
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,440
if you dropped 10-pound
sledgehammer on his foot.

99
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:47,320
Hugged kid, though,
and cried like baby. No shit.

100
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:48,840
Wow.

101
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,360
We have to kill those germs.

102
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,800
- For borscht...
- We have a saying in Russia.

103
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:56,840
How much you eat,
that's how old you are.

104
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,400
My grandpa, before
he'd hire anybody,

105
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:01,080
he'd feed them a free meal.

106
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,080
- Those who ate the most...
- Whoa.

107
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,000
...that's the ones
he hired, 'cause...

108
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,760
Those were the best workers.

109
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,640
Are you trying
to hire me or something?

110
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,480
How about
doing the dishes after dinner?

111
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:13,640
Kostya, no.

112
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:16,640
You know, Zia, dishwashing was Eugene's
first job in America.

113
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,760
No way.

114
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,360
I did a lot of shit.

115
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,400
Last job I had before I offed
was waiting tables.

116
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:24,880
I thought it was the band thing.

117
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,920
I had to eat, too.

118
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,680
You know, I wish
we were there for Eugene.

119
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,200
You see, Zia, all of us,
we were always together.

120
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:37,040
First in Russia,
then in America, now here.

121
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,640
When Ivan and I came here and left our boys
alone, they just couldn't make...

122
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,240
Mom, that's all over now.

123
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,560
Yeah.

124
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,560
Where are you from, Zia?

125
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,840
Uh, New Jersey.

126
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,120
Oh. What about your parents?

127
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,960
Uh, it's... it's a long story.

128
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,200
It's not... Basically, at the end,

129
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:55,120
- I hadn't talk to them in a while.
- Zia, it's okay.

130
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,840
They hadn't talked to each other.

131
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:57,879
It is, yeah.

132
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,560
<i>Nyet.</i>

133
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:01,720
Not every family is lucky like we are.

134
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,000
That's true.

135
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,840
But all of us being together...

136
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:16,040
You know,

137
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,120
I'd be here a long time ago
if it weren't for Eugene.

138
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,920
Yeah? How come?

139
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,240
I was 10.

140
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,760
We had these soccer finals.

141
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,240
I was the goalie for my school.

142
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:27,400
Eugene!

143
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:31,360
Don't you hear I'm jamming?

144
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,520
How is it possible
for the better team to lose?

145
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:37,520
We didn't deserve to!

146
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,800
The ball just wouldn't get in!

147
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,680
And they won it in the finals!

148
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,760
So what's the point of living

149
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,680
when life is so unfair
and everything?

150
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:52,520
I'm just telling you this because you're
the smartest person I know.

151
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,240
If you don't give me one
good reason to keep living

152
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:57,760
and tell me what's the meaning of life,

153
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:00,440
I'm gonna do this.

154
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,000
Step down from the table.

155
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,240
No. First tell me.

156
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,960
Step down from the table,
and I'll tell you.

157
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,080
He just smacked you?

158
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,320
Yeah.

159
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,280
I don't exactly know what he was trying
to tell me when he did it,

160
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,960
but it worked fine
up until a couple months ago.

161
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,200
You know, when I see
you guys like this,

162
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,800
it kind of makes me
miss my parents,

163
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:53,640
even though most of the time
they just kind of freaked me out.

164
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,600
You know...

165
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:07,680
why didn't we move in together earlier?

166
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,280
'Cause we didn't know
it'd be this fun.

167
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,440
Yeah.

168
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,640
Oh, God, I love those things.

169
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,720
These what? These?

170
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,720
Who? Ophelia?

171
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,520
Desiree.

172
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,240
Whatever. An ex-girlfriend from an ex-life.

173
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,320
Listen, tonight when we go out,
man, you got to promise...

174
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,200
No, no, no. Eugene, I'm not going out
tonight or any other night.

175
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:47,760
- What?
- It just makes me depressed.

176
00:14:47,840 --> 00:14:50,160
So what are you going to do?
Kill yourself?

177
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:52,360
I don't know. Maybe.

178
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:56,080
As if anything would make you happy.

179
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,440
I love you.

180
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,640
- I love you.
- You do?

181
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,920
Did you finish my cottage cheese?

182
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:12,440
Zia, did you finish my cottage cheese?

183
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,200
Calm down, Erik. I'll buy you
some more cottage cheese.

184
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,800
No. That's not the point.

185
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:20,320
I was planning on having some right now.

186
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:23,000
Don't you have a plan B
or something?

187
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:24,960
Zia, you do it all the time!

188
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:28,240
All right! All right!

189
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:30,480
I'll go get some more
cottage cheese.

190
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,080
Zia?

191
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:41,200
I was hoping we'd run into
each other sooner or later.

192
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:44,240
Brian, what are you doing here?

193
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:47,160
Same as everyone else.
Same as everyone else.

194
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,240
Only it's got a little something to do with you.

195
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,680
Oh, yeah?

196
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,720
Did you come all the way here
to get the 200 bucks I owe you?

197
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,640
You were always a million laughs.

198
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:57,000
But, no, that's not it.

199
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,840
You know how people say that
suicides happen in threes?

200
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:02,120
Well, there's something to that.

201
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,640
Hey, is this cheese any good?

202
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,920
Uh, my roommate likes it.

203
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:08,840
You know, when people start
offing themselves around you,

204
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,360
you start asking yourself,
what makes me so different?

205
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,680
You know?
What's keeping me alive?

206
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,720
Then it hit me like a mallet.

207
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:18,400
I don't have the answers.
Too much sodium.

208
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,880
But I think it was Desiree's suicide
that really hit me.

209
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,160
- D-Desiree's what?
- Yeah, Desiree's.

210
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,640
She offed herself about a month after you.
I figured you'd know that.

211
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,440
- No.
- Hey!

212
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:31,520
What about the 200 you owe me?
I still want that.

213
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,120
So I'm saying I got a pretty good idea

214
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,280
she's not in the city.

215
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,720
Call it, you know, intuition or whatever.

216
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,760
Listen, man, worst-case scenario,
we just take a ride, right?

217
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,560
Who, we?

218
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,600
All right.

219
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,520
Let me put it this way.

220
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:55,080
Since you got here,
how many times did you get laid, man?

221
00:16:56,040 --> 00:16:58,120
- Why?
- Just a question.

222
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,720
Actually laid?

223
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,400
Yes.

224
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,360
- None, I think.
- You think?

225
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,720
None. But what's that got
to do with any of this?

226
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,120
Plenty. 'Cause your sperm count is so high,

227
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,960
you think you're having
an out-of-body experience

228
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,200
like nobody in the whole
fucking universe, man.

229
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,560
Eugene.

230
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,080
Sperm count too high?
That's a crock.

231
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,840
Listen, man, just let me borrow the car.

232
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,280
You don't have to do anything else.

233
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,200
Don't... Don't get so touchy
on me all of a sudden.

234
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,440
All I said is not good enough reason
for me to go.

235
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,080
Listen, you know what?
Forget Desiree.

236
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,320
I got another reason for you to go.

237
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,040
Give it a shot.

238
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,760
You got anything better to do?

239
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,360
I mean, what's the big deal?

240
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,560
It's just the headlights, right?

241
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,960
You wouldn't
believe how many times

242
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,400
I've tried to have it fixed.

243
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,680
You're telling me this now?

244
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,560
I mean, this means we can't
drive at night. At all.

245
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,160
We'll stop somewhere
before it gets dark.

246
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,040
We'll just get them fixed.
It's on me. I'll pay for it.

247
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,480
If you insist.

248
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,760
But I'll bet you a beer it can't be fixed.

249
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:12,400
Let's get some music, man.

250
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,520
What is this? These work, right?

251
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,440
- Oh, shit.
- What?

252
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:19,280
Anything that goes underneath that seat,
forget about it.

253
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:21,640
Is there a hole or something?

254
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,160
Yeah.

255
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,800
No. It's, uh...

256
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,880
Kind of.

257
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,240
It's more like... I guess you'd say black hole

258
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:32,840
or a... a... a Bermuda Triangle.

259
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,640
You know, things just
disappear on you.

260
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,880
That's not very good.

261
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:46,320
What is it?

262
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,280
- It's my old band.
- Really?

263
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,640
I had it in my pocket when I offed.

264
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,680
Take that for a sec.

265
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,680
Oh, man, that's worse
than I remember.

266
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:03,600
What are you talking about? I like it.

267
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,520
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

268
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,840
It's not bad at all.

269
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,280
Mike's Car Shop.

270
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,920
Perfect timing, huh?

271
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,840
I'll bet you a beer they can't fix it.

272
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,080
You're on, man.

273
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,560
Uh, okay.

274
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:48,000
Um, uh, it's broken.

275
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:49,520
And so I don't... I don't...

276
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,360
I'm not sure what it is that's wrong.

277
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:56,840
But Mike is my... is my boss,
and he's an absolute genius.

278
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:58,800
We're gonna get it fixed.
You guys just wait right here.

279
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,360
Okay? Okay?

280
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,840
Hey, see that car?

281
00:20:08,920 --> 00:20:11,720
It's been cruising back and forth
since we got here.

282
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,160
I saw it five times already.

283
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,320
It's a taxicab, Eugene.

284
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:18,160
Think, man.

285
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:21,520
Who the fuck would need taxi here?

286
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:24,040
I don't... I don't know.
What are you trying to say?

287
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,000
Look at the driver.

288
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,200
- Why?
- He's Arab.

289
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,240
You've never seen
an Arab taxi driver before?

290
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:33,000
Oh, sure, I did.

291
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,200
But not since I offed.

292
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,120
Connect the dots.

293
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,960
Arabs, suicides.

294
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,280
Doesn't that freak you out
even a little bit?

295
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,680
No, man. You sound
like a fucking, uh,

296
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:47,080
Homeland Security agent.

297
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,680
I mean, you forget where we are.

298
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,800
He's dead already.

299
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,360
We're dead.
Everybody here is dead.

300
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,840
He's not gonna try anything.
Nobody gives a shit here.

301
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:56,240
We're all immigrants now, man.

302
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,200
Then why is he looking
at me like that?

303
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,280
'Cause you're staring at him
like you need a fucking taxicab.

304
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,760
Quit looking at him. He'll go away.

305
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:07,760
Oh, shoot.

306
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,960
It looks like we're staying here tonight.

307
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:13,160
Hey, boy, how you doin'? You're pretty.

308
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:16,360
Hey, Jimmy, why don't you
go start this thing up?

309
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,080
Let's hear this beauty moan.

310
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,320
Well... Moan?
No, no. We just want to...

311
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,000
The headlights.

312
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,280
Oh, you need a...

313
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:37,360
You need an exhaust system,
valves got to be adjusted.

314
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,600
Oh, what a bitch
of a fuel pump you got in there.

315
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,360
No, no, no, no. No, no.

316
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:43,240
We just want to fix the headlights.

317
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,320
Honey, are you home?

318
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,640
Honey?

319
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:06,920
He hasn't slept a wink
since we got here.

320
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,240
We'll fix your headlights by tomorrow.

321
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,000
- Get them fixed by tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?

322
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,960
Yeah. Tomorrow.

323
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,960
Fucking shift stick.

324
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:53,880
This is the last time I sleep in the car.

325
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,800
Yeah.

326
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,040
Where are my shades?

327
00:23:00,040 --> 00:23:02,680
I dropped them.

328
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:05,560
Man, I told you to be
careful about that, man.

329
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,400
- I know, I know.
- God damn it.

330
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:10,120
I was, Eugene. It's... It's so bright.

331
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,800
I didn't mean to drop them
under there.

332
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,280
I gotta piss, man.

333
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,000
God damn!

334
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,160
What the hell?

335
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:23,080
Morning, boys.

336
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,920
Nothing like a good
night's sleep, huh?

337
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:29,320
These headlights
are giving me a headache.

338
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,280
But you give me a day or two,

339
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,960
I'll have it fixed up
once and for all and forever.

340
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,720
That's how Mike does it.

341
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:39,240
Once and all and for... forever.

342
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:42,640
Wait. Look at this,
look at this, look at this.

343
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,200
Looks like you owe me
first beer of the day.

344
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,320
I told you, man. No one can fix
the headlights in this car.

345
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,000
You asleep?

346
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:03,840
Yeah, man, I'm asleep.

347
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:06,440
You're missing a lot of beautiful shit.

348
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,560
Can't believe you lost my shades.

349
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,200
Holy shit.

350
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,320
Oh, geez!

351
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,120
What the... Wait. What... Oh...

352
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,560
Eugene, what?

353
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:39,720
What?

354
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,880
Afternoon, lady.

355
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,280
Where you guys going?

356
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,880
East-ish.

357
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,240
East-ish?

358
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,760
You guys don't have any clue
where you're going, do you?

359
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:56,880
Well, you haven't been here very long, right?

360
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,880
Why's that?

361
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:01,960
'Cause if anybody here had a clue,
we wouldn't be here in the first place.

362
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,480
True.

363
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:08,040
I am pretty new.

364
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,200
Actually, I've been hitchhiking
ever since I got here.

365
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,480
How come?

366
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:16,040
Because I'm looking
for the people in charge.

367
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,800
- People in charge?
- Yeah.

368
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:20,200
Just where do you think you are?

369
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,600
Some kind of country club

370
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:26,600
where you can just walk
into the main office?

371
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,760
Tell me, please,
when you were still living,

372
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,600
did you ever try to go looking for God?

373
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,360
No. But I really didn't have
any reason to back then.

374
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,160
And what reason do you have now?

375
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,120
I mean, you know,
are you just sorry you offed?

376
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:41,280
You, uh, changed your mind?

377
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,120
Because, you know, if that's the case,

378
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:44,720
and you're just waiting
for visa back home...

379
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,760
- Eugene, Eugene, Eugene.
- What? What?

380
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,040
What's your name?

381
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,640
Mikal.

382
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,320
- What's your name?
- Zia.

383
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,240
- Eugene.
- Nice to meet you.

384
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,040
- Nice to meet you.
- Thanks.

385
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,760
So you're trying to leave?

386
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,200
You don't like it here?

387
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:00,840
Are you joking?

388
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,280
Do you guys like it here?

389
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,920
Who the hell likes being stuck in a place
where you can't even smile?

390
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,520
It's hot as balls. Everybody's an asshole.

391
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:14,400
I just want to go home.

392
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,840
- I don't know.
- I like it.

393
00:26:25,920 --> 00:26:27,960
Yeah, better than sleeping
in the car, man.

394
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,200
All right.

395
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:31,520
I'll go get the cashier.

396
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:37,200
I like that it has a window right here.

397
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:39,120
It's nice.

398
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:43,720
You want to try it out?

399
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,480
What do you mean?

400
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,680
You know what I mean.

401
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,200
I think I'm gonna go
see how Zia's doing.

402
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:26,440
I wonder if people who die normally
end up with no stars.

403
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,680
I really miss the stars.

404
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,560
You get used to it.

405
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:35,120
I don't want to get used to it.
I want to go home.

406
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:39,200
This guy who gave me
a ride the other day,

407
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,800
he said that he actually heard rumors
about the people in charge.

408
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,760
Um, apparently they wear
white outfits or something.

409
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,600
That's a crock of shit... white outfits.

410
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,680
He was just trying to get into your pants.

411
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:51,400
No, he wasn't.

412
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,360
He said he thought I had a really good case.

413
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,480
Oh, and what makes
your case so special,

414
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,640
if you don't mind me asking?

415
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,840
That I got here by mistake.

416
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:04,840
Well, we all got here by some mistake
one way or another.

417
00:28:04,920 --> 00:28:06,800
And believe me,
you have as much chance

418
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,760
at finding your folks in white
as Zia has to find his dead princess.

419
00:28:10,800 --> 00:28:12,400
You don't know that.

420
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:15,280
No, you don't. I bet he'll find her.

421
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,760
Yeah. Besides, I got a hunch
she's not that far away.

422
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:21,960
Wherever she is,

423
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:24,680
I bet she found someone by now.

424
00:28:24,760 --> 00:28:28,440
Probably some black guy
who hanged himself by his dick.

425
00:28:28,520 --> 00:28:30,760
It wouldn't matter, Eugene.

426
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,040
You know, I was thinking.

427
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,280
Yeah?

428
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,360
If you were to ever cheat on me...

429
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,480
make sure you do it
with somebody who's really pretty.

430
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:57,360
What are you...
What are you talking about?

431
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,400
I'm not gonna cheat on you.
Why do you say that?

432
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,360
I know, baby.

433
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,880
Hey, Eugene, do you mind if I drive?

434
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,480
I'll get us there in half the time.

435
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,000
Get us where?

436
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,760
Over there.

437
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,760
Oh, there.

438
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,720
All right, then.

439
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:01,160
I'm not sitting in the back.

440
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,440
Why not?

441
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,080
'Cause everybody knows
guy in the back seat doesn't have a cock.

442
00:30:07,040 --> 00:30:09,040
- What?
- That's a fact.

443
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,000
If the guy in the back seat
had a cock,

444
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,760
he wouldn't be back there
in the first place.

445
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,400
Well, I... I mean, I got a cock, man.

446
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,240
So how can... I'm not...

447
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,240
Mik, do you have a cock?

448
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:22,920
Yeah, I have a cock.

449
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:24,560
A big fat one.

450
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,480
I'm looking for the people in charge

451
00:30:45,520 --> 00:30:46,600
because I'm here by mistake.

452
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:47,960
I'm not supposed to be here.

453
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,720
I've been looking for a while.

454
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,000
I'm looking for a girl named Desiree.

455
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:54,760
Short blonde hair,
about this tall.

456
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:57,920
I'm not sure what you're
trying to accomplish is completely legal.

457
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,960
- Well, that's very...
- Can I see some I. D?

458
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:01,800
We're looking for the people in charge
of this place

459
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,280
because I've only been
here a couple weeks

460
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,400
and I got here by mistake.

461
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,280
Did I show you...

462
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,560
Thanks, "Ociffer," but we...

463
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,040
The people in charge.

464
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:11,320
<i>- Nyet, Mom.
- P.I.C.</i>

465
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,720
About this tall.

466
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,640
Her name's Desiree. She's really pretty.

467
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,840
When there's a trap

468
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,600
Set up for you

469
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:42,760
In every corner of your room

470
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,800
And so

471
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:48,360
The only way to go

472
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,120
Is

473
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,280
Through the roof

474
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,640
Through the roof

475
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:02,560
Underground

476
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:08,760
Through the roof

477
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:11,960
Underground

478
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:16,240
And as we crossing border after border

479
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,680
We realize the differences now

480
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,680
It's underdogs who

481
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,600
And if you want it, too

482
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:30,160
You'll always have to make your own fun

483
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,160
Hey, man, you need
to wipe these off for me.

484
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,080
Man, are you doing that
intentionally to hurt me?

485
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,920
No. No. It's... It's not my fault.

486
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,400
I just wanted you to clean those off.

487
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,280
- I know. I was cleaning.
- That's a hole. I told you.

488
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,040
You want to see if my hat
drops down the hole?

489
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:53,800
No, I'm not gonna
drop your hat in the hole!

490
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,280
Guys, guys, guys, guys!

491
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,200
Here's my tobacco.
See if that goes down.

492
00:32:57,280 --> 00:32:59,680
Guys, guys, please stop bickering.

493
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:01,680
Please?

494
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,880
Eugene, there's a diner right there.
Will you stop?

495
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:05,400
Good. Perfect timing.

496
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,400
And you, don't touch my stuff no more.

497
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:10,040
- You handed me the shades, man.
- Don't touch my stuff no more.

498
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,880
Yes, Mama.

499
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:20,840
Didn't he already talk
to his mom this morning?

500
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:24,280
Yeah, but, supposedly,
that's, uh, normal in Russia.

501
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,920
I don't think that's normal anywhere.

502
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:30,360
Yeah, I know.

503
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:33,000
I'm gonna go get some smokes.
Do you want anything?

504
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:43,880
Next time you grab my ass,

505
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,760
I'm going to tell your mom, asshole, okay?

506
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,560
Okay?

507
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:17,160
All I'm saying is neither of us
have scored with her, you know?

508
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,240
I don't know about that.

509
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,800
The other night, uh, she said
she thought you were cute.

510
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,640
Cute?

511
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:27,080
That's what they say about a puppy.

512
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:30,280
The only thing worse
is "good friend" or "nice person."

513
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,720
In plain English it means
"I'll leech off you as long as I can,

514
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:35,560
but don't even think
about getting into my pants."

515
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,400
Yeah, well, you might be right about that.

516
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:40,680
Of course I'm right.
I say we get rid of her while we still can.

517
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:41,800
I mean, look.

518
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,560
Look at what we're losing out on
because of her.

519
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,040
Yeah, I don't know.

520
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:51,280
The whole "people in charge" thing
is a little weird.

521
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,400
See? That's what I'm talking about.

522
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:00,840
Shoot.

523
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:03,640
Look, fuck her, man.

524
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,240
Okay? That's what I'm talking about.

525
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,760
She's eavesdropping
on her friends now.

526
00:35:57,120 --> 00:35:59,880
Where'd you get those shades?

527
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:01,600
What shades?

528
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,200
Mikal bought us shades, man.

529
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:17,280
Sweet of her.

530
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,520
But it is good to be on our own, you know?

531
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,520
Eugene, you know, I love you, man,

532
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,120
but you can be an asshole.

533
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,720
What do you care?

534
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,640
We're looking for Irene, right?

535
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,360
Yeah, we're looking for Irene.

536
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,440
All right. Then let's look for Irene.

537
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:03,480
Okay, just calm down.

538
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,800
If you just comply,
everything's gonna be just fine.

539
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:07,400
On what charges?

540
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,480
Breaking that sign is
a clear case of vandalism.

541
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:10,640
That's absolutely retarded.

542
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:11,800
- You're handcuffing me, too?
- Yes.

543
00:37:11,810 --> 00:37:12,840
Are you serious?

544
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,080
Yes, I'm placing you under arrest.
Hands behind your back.

545
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,920
I was just trying to make this place

546
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,280
a little bit less depressing.

547
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,760
What's the big deal with that?
This is so dramatic.

548
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,360
You don't even need to be doing this.

549
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,240
- No. Wait, Officer.
- What the hell is your problem?

550
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,480
That's my sister. What's going on?

551
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,760
- Your sister?
- Yeah, yeah. What's going on?

552
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:31,760
I'm afraid your sister's been arrested.

553
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,280
Arrested?

554
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,000
Wait. Can I talk to you for a minute?

555
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:39,200
What have you got to say?

556
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,600
I... I mean, she's only
been here a few mo...

557
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,600
- You know, how long you been here?
- Some time.

558
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,080
First of all, she just got here.

559
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:55,360
Well, you remember what it's like
those first couple months, right?

560
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,840
I mean, the no-smiling thing's
really getting to her.

561
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,040
Nobody's got any good humor
or anything like that.

562
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,960
Well, I can turn
my head away this once.

563
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:34,800
Yeah?

564
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,800
Ma'am, you better watch your behavior.

565
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,040
You bet, Officer.

566
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:45,400
You didn't have to do that.

567
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:52,280
Thank you.

568
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:01,920
What are you... You gonna...

569
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,320
Can we still give you a ride?

570
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,000
No, thanks. I think I'm headed
the other way.

571
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:12,760
Listen, I...

572
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:16,080
I'm sorry about all that back there.

573
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,840
It's...

574
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,360
We didn't mean that.
It's just Eugene's venting.

575
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:21,920
That's okay.

576
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,360
Doesn't matter.

577
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:27,240
I just want to...

578
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,640
We don't...
We don't mean that.

579
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,280
You know what?
It's probably gonna be hard

580
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,640
for me to get a ride
with you standing there, so...

581
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:39,880
Yeah. Probably right.

582
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,840
I hope you find what you're looking for.

583
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,960
Thank you.

584
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,640
I really do.

585
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:01,600
- Where were you, man?
- Guess who I just saw.

586
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:02,639
Who?

587
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,400
Mikal. She's right back there.

588
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,360
What the fuck was that?

589
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:10,440
Oh, man. You didn't
take out the nozzle?

590
00:40:11,960 --> 00:40:13,920
You deal with this guy. I'm not into it.

591
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:15,040
What?

592
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,440
I'm sorry again.

593
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,880
Oh, it happens all the time.

594
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,240
At least twice a week.

595
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:26,040
- Really?
- It happens. See?

596
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:29,240
All these are already filled out.

597
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,240
Right here.

598
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,840
What's this here about, uh,

599
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:44,960
"What were you thinking
when the incident occurred?"

600
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:46,760
Exactly that.

601
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,240
Here I am again, buried in debt.

602
00:41:09,320 --> 00:41:11,440
If pulling the trigger
didn't solve my problems,

603
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,360
what the hell will?

604
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:19,120
I was wondering if I
was too drunk to drive.

605
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,680
But the problem with you
is that you don't think it's fucked up

606
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,640
- to talk shit about me when I'm not there.
- I was kidding.

607
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,520
You were kidding?
You didn't know I was listening.

608
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,840
No, I didn't.
That's eavesdropping.

609
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:44,600
- That's what I'm talking about.
- Whatever.

610
00:41:44,680 --> 00:41:46,440
- Look, I found...
- Calm down, man.

611
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:47,880
- Look at this.
- Calm down. Relax.

612
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,320
It's her phone number. It's Desiree.

613
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,560
It's her phone number, her address,
everything. Look at that.

614
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,720
I spaced out because the man at pump 3
looked just like my ex-boyfriend.

615
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:57,640
Where is he?

616
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,480
He feels so close.

617
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:03,080
I knew she was close, man.
I told you, man. I felt it.

618
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,040
All right. What do you want to do?
You want to call her?

619
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:07,200
No, let's go over there.

620
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,720
That guy said it's
not very far from here.

621
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,400
Let's go, man. Let's go!
I told you, man.

622
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,960
You should buy her
some flowers at least.

623
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:18,640
Flowers would be nice, but I... I...

624
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:20,680
did you see the flowers in there?

625
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:22,920
Yeah.

626
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,320
That's not too bad, huh?

627
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,120
- Yeah. Desiree has some taste.
- No shit.

628
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:43,520
What other color could someone
named Desiree like but turquoise?

629
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:30,280
Oh, holy shit.

630
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,200
Yeah, it doesn't look good.

631
00:43:43,840 --> 00:43:45,320
What happened?

632
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:47,360
She moved.

633
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:49,800
Where?

634
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,320
He doesn't know.

635
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,680
Any forward address?

636
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:02,440
Sorry, Zia.

637
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:08,200
At least we know we're
getting closer, right?

638
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,000
Yeah.

639
00:44:10,080 --> 00:44:12,200
You deserve a drink, man.

640
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:57,000
He's sleeping.

641
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,800
Fucker's always sleeping in the car.

642
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:02,440
What's this button do?

643
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,520
That doesn't work.
No, don't. Don't push that.

644
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:06,640
That doesn't...

645
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,160
Christ, are you seeing
what I'm seeing?

646
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,840
In-fucking-credible!

647
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,640
What?

648
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:24,720
Look! Look! Look!

649
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:26,480
You're a genius.

650
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:27,600
Oh, it's the headlights...

651
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,360
Okay, Eugene. Take it easy.

652
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:35,040
It's just the headlights, man.

653
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,960
It's great, but it's...

654
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:43,560
Oh, that is beautiful.

655
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:46,040
Do it again, Eugene.

656
00:45:46,120 --> 00:45:47,840
Yeah?

657
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:50,120
Beautiful.

658
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:54,560
Eugene, watch out!

659
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,920
What happened? Fuck.

660
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,200
Oh, my God.

661
00:46:11,480 --> 00:46:12,680
You all right, Eugene?

662
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:14,679
- Yeah, I'm fine, man.
- Yeah?

663
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,840
Oh, my God.

664
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:18,840
What the...

665
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,000
Hey. Hey. Hey.

666
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:23,160
Maybe he's sleeping.

667
00:46:25,479 --> 00:46:26,479
Be careful.

668
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:28,680
Hey.

669
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:30,600
Hey, man.

670
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,720
You on drugs or something?

671
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,200
Jesus.

672
00:46:47,760 --> 00:46:50,120
I must've dozed off.

673
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,720
I think I slept on my ear wrong.

674
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,120
Do I look asymmetrical to you at all?

675
00:46:56,200 --> 00:47:01,040
Yeah, I'm sorry. I'm Raife Kneller.

676
00:47:01,120 --> 00:47:05,640
Um... don't call me Raife.

677
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,880
My mom used to call me Raife, and I...

678
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:10,400
Don't get me started on it.
Just call me Kneller.

679
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:15,080
I lost my dog,
and I'm just sick about it.

680
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:17,840
You haven't seen a dog.
His name's Freddy.

681
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:20,960
You'd look for him
while laying in the middle of the road.

682
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,240
Well, I had to take a break.

683
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:24,720
I mean, it's emotional work.

684
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,640
Emotio... In the middle
of the fucking road?

685
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:29,200
Don't you think that's
a bit irresponsible?

686
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:34,240
Hey, look, it's too late, really,
to continue looking for Freddy.

687
00:47:34,279 --> 00:47:35,279
You know, I, uh...

688
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,280
Why don't we go to my place?

689
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:44,920
Nothing really is for rent here.

690
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:48,400
I mean, it was at one time.

691
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:52,800
I rented the place
several years ago, and I...

692
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:57,000
The other thing is
it's not really a camp.

693
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:00,440
It's just a joke a friend of mine
thought would be funny.

694
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:02,920
I really don't think it's funny.
Do you think it's funny?

695
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:05,240
I don't. Actually...

696
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,760
Guys. Eugene, Mik, look at that.

697
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:14,840
What?

698
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:21,440
That guy was just floating in the air.

699
00:48:23,999 --> 00:48:24,999
Floating?

700
00:48:25,000 --> 00:48:26,400
He was. He was...

701
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:28,360
I wouldn't pay any attention to it.

702
00:48:28,440 --> 00:48:30,520
It happens all the time around here.

703
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:32,360
What happens? Miracles?

704
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:35,880
Yeah, people floating in the air,

705
00:48:35,960 --> 00:48:40,480
like, uh, people turning
stones into plants

706
00:48:40,560 --> 00:48:45,120
or changing the color
of different objects.

707
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,680
Fixing the headlights, maybe?

708
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,880
What do you mean,
fixing the headlights?

709
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:51,720
His headlights have
been broken for ages,

710
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:54,720
and she fixed them not far from here
just by touching a button.

711
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:58,400
Oh. Yeah, something
small and insignificant like that.

712
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:01,920
Is that another one of your miracles?

713
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:05,960
No, that's Nanuk. She's a mute.

714
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:08,240
She does this throat singing.

715
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:11,160
She's hilarious. I'll be right back.

716
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,200
Nanuk, we... we have new guests.

717
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:19,600
That guy was 3 feet off the ground.

718
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:22,360
Fresh sheets, coffee, and all that.

719
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:25,080
People, Nanuk.

720
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:26,240
Nanuk will look after you.

721
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:28,760
I got some business.

722
00:49:28,840 --> 00:49:32,080
Hey, make sure you
take care of my car, man.

723
00:49:34,200 --> 00:49:35,560
All right, Nanuk.

724
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,360
I guess you take care of us.

725
00:49:47,480 --> 00:49:51,320
Once upon a time,
there was a crooked tree

726
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:53,040
and a straight tree,

727
00:49:53,120 --> 00:49:57,280
and they grew next to each other.

728
00:49:57,360 --> 00:50:00,960
And every day the...

729
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:03,120
straight tree would look
at the crooked tree.

730
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:05,240
He would say, "You're crooked.

731
00:50:05,320 --> 00:50:07,080
"You've always been crooked,

732
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:09,880
"and you'll continue to be crooked.

733
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,000
But look at me. Look at me,"
said the straight tree.

734
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:17,160
He said, "I'm tall and I'm straight."

735
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:21,200
And then one day,
the lumberjacks came into the forest

736
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:22,720
and looked around.

737
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,560
And the manager in charge said,

738
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,680
"Cut all the straight trees."

739
00:50:29,760 --> 00:50:34,160
And that crooked tree
is still there to this day,

740
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:37,760
growing strong and growing strange.

741
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:54,760
Just forget about the miracles, Zia.

742
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:56,920
They don't mean a thing.

743
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,560
Everybody in camp
can do that but me.

744
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:01,680
Hey, give yourself a break, man.

745
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:04,520
I'm dying to do one.

746
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:08,360
Just a small one, even if it's stupid.

747
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:10,040
Here's the deal.

748
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:13,560
As long as you want it so bad,
it's not gonna happen.

749
00:51:13,640 --> 00:51:17,720
The only way it's gonna work
is if it doesn't matter.

750
00:51:18,760 --> 00:51:20,400
Here you go, girl.

751
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,480
Drink up, my man.

752
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:24,080
You know what I'm saying?

753
00:51:24,160 --> 00:51:25,400
I don't know. I guess.

754
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,760
I don't know.
It just doesn't make any sense to me.

755
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:31,840
It will. It will.

756
00:51:33,320 --> 00:51:36,480
Hey, Kneller, do you mind
if I use your truck?

757
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:37,640
'Cause we're out of logs.

758
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:40,120
Sure. You look great in that.

759
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,840
I know. I like it.

760
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:46,960
Zia, you wanna go for a ride?

761
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:48,400
Yeah.

762
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,000
Are you gonna be all right, Kneller?

763
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:52,120
Go ahead.

764
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:10,760
It's nice here, right?

765
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,640
Yeah.

766
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,440
You ever miss the things
from before you offed?

767
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:24,360
No, I don't really remember much.

768
00:52:24,440 --> 00:52:26,880
I think the only thing
I missed is Desiree.

769
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:31,000
Now that she's here,
it's like the only thing I can think about.

770
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:33,920
I miss everything.

771
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,840
I miss my friends, I miss my dog,

772
00:52:36,880 --> 00:52:41,400
I miss my family, my house, everything.

773
00:52:41,480 --> 00:52:44,520
I even miss the things I hated at this point.

774
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,680
I don't know.

775
00:52:46,760 --> 00:52:48,520
It's weird. I had this dream the other night

776
00:52:48,560 --> 00:52:52,760
that I woke up in the hospital
because my... my suicide didn't work.

777
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,120
And while I was there, I just...

778
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:00,880
I just kind of missed this.

779
00:53:12,200 --> 00:53:14,760
He's teaching her
how to open a beer with a lighter.

780
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,160
He's teaching her how to open
a beer with a lighter.

781
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:19,480
She doesn't even drink. Let me see.

782
00:53:19,560 --> 00:53:20,720
You see?

783
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:22,920
Yeah. Yeah.
You should've seen him the other day.

784
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,320
He was trying to teach her

785
00:53:24,360 --> 00:53:26,600
the famous basketball players names

786
00:53:26,680 --> 00:53:28,480
and their positions and everything.

787
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,600
She had no clue what he was saying.

788
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:33,760
The secret is that
she's from way too far away

789
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:35,560
to pick up on his character.

790
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:38,400
- And half her family offed just like his.
- I know.

791
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:41,640
She doesn't live with him, though.

792
00:53:43,400 --> 00:53:46,240
Holy shit. He caught a fish.

793
00:53:48,160 --> 00:53:49,360
- Oh, my God, he's doing it.
- What?

794
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:51,640
He's changing the color of the fish.

795
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:53,240
With his bare hand,
he's holding the fish,

796
00:53:53,320 --> 00:53:54,640
and he changed the color.

797
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:58,280
Oh, Zia, when are you gonna
stop being obsessed

798
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:59,720
with those silly little miracles?

799
00:54:03,239 --> 00:54:04,239
I don't know.

800
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:07,720
When you stop being obsessed
with all that people in charge shit.

801
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:10,840
That is not the same.

802
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,080
Yeah, right, you know,

803
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:14,160
because you're here
by mistake or whatever.

804
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:15,560
I'm sorry, I guess I just...

805
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,160
I don't see how
you could possibly be...

806
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:19,560
You know what, listen, you little jerk.

807
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:22,280
I never killed myself.

808
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,040
I just OD'd.

809
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,880
All right, go.

810
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,080
Zia, what are you waiting for?

811
00:55:09,160 --> 00:55:10,240
Come on, man.

812
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,160
Zia, hurry.

813
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:13,360
Shit.

814
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:15,320
- Hey, Zia!
- Kneller?

815
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:17,000
Float on up.

816
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:18,840
Come on, we gotta go.

817
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:19,920
Float on up.

818
00:55:19,960 --> 00:55:20,960
Float?

819
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,560
Come on, man.

820
00:55:22,600 --> 00:55:24,120
I can't.

821
00:55:24,200 --> 00:55:26,120
You gonna spend the rest
of your life down there?

822
00:55:26,200 --> 00:55:27,600
No, but what if I...

823
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,320
They're gonna be here in a second.

824
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:34,280
No, no, no. Wait! Wait for me!

825
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:40,080
Mom? Dad? What are
you guys doing here?

826
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:41,160
Where have you been all this time?

827
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,960
Why haven't you called us?

828
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:11,200
You're awake?

829
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:16,000
I've been thinking.

830
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,600
If I'm gonna find the people in charge,

831
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:18,760
I have to keep looking.

832
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:22,560
I'm not gonna find them here.

833
00:56:22,599 --> 00:56:23,599
You know?

834
00:56:23,600 --> 00:56:26,760
Yeah, I think you're right.

835
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,480
I think if I'm gonna find Desiree,

836
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:30,960
I'm gonna have to start
looking elsewhere, too.

837
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,440
We can't wait for Eugene forever.

838
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:41,440
Yeah, I know.

839
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,320
Mom?

840
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:19,960
I found him! I found him!

841
00:57:20,040 --> 00:57:21,800
I found Kneller's dog!

842
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:23,240
I found Freddy!

843
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:26,000
Yan, what happened to you?

844
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:32,400
Messiah King lives
at the other side of the forest,

845
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:34,960
and he's holding Kneller's dog captive.

846
00:57:35,040 --> 00:57:36,200
What?

847
00:57:36,239 --> 00:57:37,239
And so many people are there,

848
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:40,800
like, hundreds to witness the miracle
he's gonna perform tomorrow.

849
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:42,440
Freddy's performing miracles?

850
00:57:42,520 --> 00:57:44,200
No. Messiah.

851
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:48,040
But not like our miracles.
A planned, significant miracle.

852
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:50,920
Here. You're bleeding.

853
00:57:52,840 --> 00:57:54,920
Well, what about Freddy?

854
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,520
How's Freddy?

855
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:00,200
Yan, is Freddy okay?

856
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:06,640
Freddy's fine.

857
00:58:06,720 --> 00:58:10,120
They feed him T-bone steak,
and he refuses to come back.

858
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,560
Freddy's been brainwashed.

859
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,000
We're driving over there right now.

860
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,560
I only know how to get there on foot.

861
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,520
How far is it?

862
00:58:17,600 --> 00:58:20,680
I'm not sure. I got lost on the way,
but five, six hours, I'd say.

863
00:58:20,720 --> 00:58:22,480
All right, first thing in the morning.

864
00:58:22,560 --> 00:58:24,960
Hey, do you guys mind
if Zia and I tag along with you?

865
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,520
Why? You guys are dying to see miracle
that asshole's gonna perform?

866
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:30,440
Yeah, I wanna go.

867
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:32,560
T-bone?

868
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,960
16 ounce, thick cut.

869
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:36,720
Damn.

870
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,320
Uh, Yan, you sure
we're going the right way?

871
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:50,720
We've been six hours or so.

872
00:58:50,760 --> 00:58:53,760
Yes. We should be there soon.

873
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:56,680
I think.

874
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:02,760
I don't know what happened.

875
00:59:02,840 --> 00:59:05,880
I was sure we'd find it before dark.

876
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:16,080
Actually, I think it's a good sign.

877
00:59:16,160 --> 00:59:19,760
I mean, you got lost last time, right?

878
00:59:19,840 --> 00:59:22,480
Yeah. You're right.

879
00:59:22,560 --> 00:59:24,200
That's a really good sign.

880
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:35,960
I hope we at least find
our way back to the camp.

881
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,600
Yeah, that'd be nice.

882
00:59:38,640 --> 00:59:42,080
I mean, I have no clue where we are.

883
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:44,280
We've been hiking for,
like, 12 hours straight.

884
00:59:44,360 --> 00:59:46,600
I mean, I don't really know
how fast we've been going...

885
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:49,840
What?

886
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:53,000
- What?
- Listen. Listen. Listen.

887
00:59:54,840 --> 00:59:56,520
Do you hear that?

888
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:58,960
Yeah, but...

889
00:59:59,040 --> 01:00:01,120
it sounds like a...

890
01:00:04,720 --> 01:00:06,960
Holy shit.

891
01:00:12,080 --> 01:00:14,160
Let's go.

892
01:00:16,360 --> 01:00:19,240
How come no one in camp
ever mentioned the beach is so close?

893
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,120
Maybe they don't know.

894
01:00:21,160 --> 01:00:23,400
Maybe we're the only ones who know.

895
01:00:26,600 --> 01:00:29,040
- Hi.
- Hi.

896
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,840
You remember the other day
when you were talking

897
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:40,680
about missing things
from life and, uh...

898
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:42,240
how you wanted to go back

899
01:00:42,320 --> 01:00:44,560
and I told you I didn't miss anything?

900
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:45,960
Yeah.

901
01:00:46,000 --> 01:00:49,560
Well...

902
01:00:49,640 --> 01:00:53,680
when I'm here...

903
01:00:55,560 --> 01:00:57,960
with you, I kind of miss myself

904
01:00:58,040 --> 01:01:00,560
the way I used to be.

905
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:02,720
What were you like?

906
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:05,600
I was... I was happy at a time.

907
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:10,760
Obviously before I came here, but...

908
01:01:10,799 --> 01:01:11,799
Yeah.

909
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:15,000
...something about
being here with you

910
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:17,480
reminds me of that.

911
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:20,680
It's just, I don't know,
it's just weird to me

912
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,200
that you can feel that
in a place like this.

913
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:28,200
We're all... We're all dead.

914
01:01:31,120 --> 01:01:32,160
You know what?

915
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,360
Most the people that I knew before I got here

916
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:38,400
were either half dead
or just completely dead already.

917
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,800
You know, completely dead.

918
01:01:40,840 --> 01:01:44,280
And you're doing pretty good, Zia.

919
01:01:44,360 --> 01:01:46,360
You think so?

920
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,560
Yeah, definitely.

921
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:28,160
Freaking out.

922
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,960
Fuck. Mik, get up.

923
01:02:33,000 --> 01:02:35,400
Oh, my God. Oh, God.

924
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:41,280
There they are.

925
01:02:41,320 --> 01:02:42,760
I've just been worried sick about you.

926
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,520
Careful. Careful. Don't step on it.

927
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,040
Put your shoes on.

928
01:02:46,120 --> 01:02:48,320
I hope you didn't sleep here.

929
01:02:48,360 --> 01:02:50,440
Well, yeah.

930
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:55,520
This is where intravenous drug users
and prostitutes congregated.

931
01:02:55,560 --> 01:02:57,360
It was too revolting for them.

932
01:02:57,440 --> 01:02:59,000
Can we get the hell out of here?

933
01:02:59,080 --> 01:03:00,800
Yeah. Careful.

934
01:03:00,840 --> 01:03:03,400
I hope Yan doesn't get lost.

935
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,320
Yan's already lost.

936
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:08,680
Shit.

937
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:11,040
Yan!

938
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:23,280
We're never gonna
make it anywhere now.

939
01:03:23,360 --> 01:03:25,760
I found it! I found it!

940
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:26,960
Where?

941
01:03:27,040 --> 01:03:29,000
Right over the hill. It's real close.

942
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:34,040
Come on, there's music
and cold drinks and dancing girls.

943
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:47,000
Excuse me.

944
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,880
Who's in charge here?

945
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:50,800
The King, of course.

946
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:53,760
Can you believe how privileged we are?

947
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,520
Hmm. Why is that?

948
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:58,040
Because of the miracle.

949
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:01,680
He will actually separate
his body from his soul.

950
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,880
Actually, we're just
looking for our dog.

951
01:04:03,960 --> 01:04:05,160
Guys, I think you should come.

952
01:04:05,240 --> 01:04:06,400
Why? What's going on?

953
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:07,760
Kneller's with the King,
and he's raising hell.

954
01:04:07,799 --> 01:04:08,799
Come on.

955
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,440
Raising hell? Yan, wait.

956
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:13,160
That dog came to me.

957
01:04:13,240 --> 01:04:15,560
Begged me to be part
of what we're doing here.

958
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:16,960
Everybody knows that's my dog.

959
01:04:17,040 --> 01:04:18,080
Nobody owns a dog.

960
01:04:18,160 --> 01:04:20,000
You kidnapped that dog.

961
01:04:20,120 --> 01:04:22,080
Those are very
serious charges, friend.

962
01:04:22,160 --> 01:04:24,200
We need to speak to the Messiah.

963
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:26,440
He's in a meeting.

964
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:27,880
He's with my friend.

965
01:04:27,920 --> 01:04:29,360
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

966
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:30,640
That dog's never been on a leash.

967
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:34,000
That dog wanted to be
on that leash.

968
01:04:37,120 --> 01:04:38,640
Zia?

969
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:40,400
Desiree.

970
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:44,120
My God.

971
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:50,000
Oh, my God, I can't believe it's you.

972
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:52,840
I can't believe it's you.

973
01:04:52,920 --> 01:04:55,280
You look absolutely the same.

974
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:59,200
Well, almost, right? But you do.

975
01:04:59,280 --> 01:05:01,120
I mean, you haven't changed your hair.

976
01:05:01,159 --> 01:05:02,159
I always...

977
01:05:02,160 --> 01:05:03,160
I know, you love this haircut.

978
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,720
- Yeah.
- I remember.

979
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,640
I remember. How are you, Zia?

980
01:05:06,720 --> 01:05:08,160
I'm good.

981
01:05:08,240 --> 01:05:10,200
Can we deal with
the dog business here?

982
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,480
All right, let's deal with the dog.

983
01:05:12,520 --> 01:05:16,120
We are going to deal with the dog.

984
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,680
Don't do that.
You're confusing the dog.

985
01:05:20,760 --> 01:05:22,680
What's your name, Honeysuckle?

986
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:24,120
Come on, Freddy. Come on.

987
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:26,200
Treat. Treat.

988
01:05:28,960 --> 01:05:30,520
The dog has spoken.

989
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:33,480
I'm tired, and I need to concentrate.

990
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:35,080
I'll see you at the ceremony.

991
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:37,840
It's gonna be a hell of a show.

992
01:05:39,960 --> 01:05:41,720
And then, after you offed,

993
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:44,840
I just cried and cried.

994
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,920
And I had to leave town

995
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:49,080
because everything reminded me of you.

996
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:55,400
Trust me. I never knew
how much I hurt you

997
01:05:55,480 --> 01:05:57,320
until you were gone.

998
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:02,360
Oh, thank God.

999
01:06:02,440 --> 01:06:04,760
Thank God I can finally
ask you to forgive me.

1000
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:12,720
King. King?

1001
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:15,440
He was a real friend.

1002
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:18,120
He got me out of town,
and I started to get

1003
01:06:18,160 --> 01:06:20,760
more and more into his teachings,

1004
01:06:20,840 --> 01:06:22,480
and I just stopped crying.

1005
01:06:22,560 --> 01:06:26,400
So then King was supposed to separate
his body from his soul

1006
01:06:26,480 --> 01:06:28,160
so he could discover
the other, better world

1007
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:31,120
and come back
and show everyone the way.

1008
01:06:31,200 --> 01:06:34,000
'Cause you know he believes

1009
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:38,800
we're all trapped
in the world of the living.

1010
01:06:41,160 --> 01:06:43,240
But something went terribly wrong,

1011
01:06:43,320 --> 01:06:46,400
and his soul never made it back.

1012
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:49,160
So at the hospital,

1013
01:06:49,200 --> 01:06:52,480
when they confirmed his death...

1014
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:54,680
I heard his soul calling me,

1015
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:59,320
and I just knew...
I knew I had to be with him, so...

1016
01:06:59,400 --> 01:07:03,760
...I took the elevator
to the hospital roof...

1017
01:07:07,520 --> 01:07:09,400
and flew.

1018
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:19,440
Oh.

1019
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:23,960
Oh, God, time flies with you, Zia.

1020
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,080
Let's go. King's about to begin.

1021
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:29,000
And this time, I know...

1022
01:07:29,080 --> 01:07:31,040
He's gonna make it.

1023
01:07:31,120 --> 01:07:34,560
Come on. I have to help King prepare.

1024
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:49,640
You two made up, huh?

1025
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:52,840
Well, I forgive, but I don't forget.

1026
01:07:54,320 --> 01:07:56,800
What keeps happening to Yan?

1027
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:58,600
Have you seen Mikal?

1028
01:07:58,680 --> 01:08:00,840
Last time I saw her,
she was talking to the big guy up there

1029
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:02,400
about, you know, going home

1030
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:04,760
and people in charge and the usual.

1031
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:06,600
Right. What'd he tell her?

1032
01:08:06,640 --> 01:08:10,560
He said, "I'm taking you all
to a better place."

1033
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:11,800
Asshole.

1034
01:08:31,720 --> 01:08:34,320
Don't be alarmed, friends.

1035
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:39,520
The vessel will die soon,

1036
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:42,880
and the spirit will rise.

1037
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:46,440
The first time was only a test...

1038
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:50,440
a precursor to the real thing.

1039
01:08:50,520 --> 01:08:51,960
Why don't you just tell her?

1040
01:08:52,040 --> 01:08:53,600
Tell her what?

1041
01:08:53,640 --> 01:08:55,640
Tell her that you love her.

1042
01:08:55,720 --> 01:08:58,080
Don't be afraid when I leave.

1043
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:00,680
You do, don't you?

1044
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:02,600
For I will be back to save you all.

1045
01:09:02,680 --> 01:09:04,360
It's too far. She won't hear.

1046
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:22,080
What is he doing?

1047
01:09:26,320 --> 01:09:28,160
He's bluffing.

1048
01:09:29,160 --> 01:09:30,680
Nobody would do that twice.

1049
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:32,680
You know how much that hurts.

1050
01:09:32,760 --> 01:09:33,760
Yeah.

1051
01:09:56,680 --> 01:09:59,040
Oh, my God.

1052
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:04,000
We're at the compound.
I need backup.

1053
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,440
Come right now.
This guy's gone crazy.

1054
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:19,720
Everyone, look! There he is!

1055
01:10:19,760 --> 01:10:23,000
He's coming. He's coming.

1056
01:10:23,080 --> 01:10:25,000
They're... They're coming.

1057
01:10:27,560 --> 01:10:29,400
Kneller.

1058
01:10:31,480 --> 01:10:35,080
Blessings. Blessings.
He's gonna show us the way.

1059
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:38,520
Everyone, keep your hands
lifted up to King.

1060
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,000
See us for bruises! Go home!

1061
01:10:40,080 --> 01:10:44,000
Everybody, go home!
Everybody, go home!

1062
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:46,240
Move! Move! Move! Go! Move! Move!

1063
01:10:46,280 --> 01:10:49,560
Everybody disperse. This is the P. I.C.

1064
01:10:49,640 --> 01:10:51,960
Go immediately. Everyone.

1065
01:10:52,040 --> 01:10:54,040
King? Wait.

1066
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:56,280
Who are you? No, no, no!

1067
01:10:56,319 --> 01:10:57,319
King! King!

1068
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:59,560
Please disperse immediately.

1069
01:10:59,600 --> 01:11:01,000
Please disperse.

1070
01:11:01,080 --> 01:11:02,440
- Yan.
- What the fuck is going on?

1071
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:03,920
I don't know. Have you seen Mikal?

1072
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,600
She was right here a second ago.

1073
01:11:06,640 --> 01:11:08,440
Please disperse.
This is the People In Charge.

1074
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:09,560
Where's Kneller?

1075
01:11:09,640 --> 01:11:11,320
I don't know. I'll be right back.

1076
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:15,160
This is the P. I. C:
the People In Charge.

1077
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:17,760
I repeat: P. I.C.

1078
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:20,880
People In Charge.

1079
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:26,640
Keep moving. Keep moving.
Evacuate immediately.

1080
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:33,840
Zia! Zia, I'll be back in five minutes.

1081
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:39,040
Please leave immediately.

1082
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:21,080
What are you guys doing here?

1083
01:12:21,160 --> 01:12:22,920
Came to pick you up, man.

1084
01:12:23,000 --> 01:12:24,440
Yan tell you what happened?

1085
01:12:24,520 --> 01:12:26,040
Kneller did.

1086
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:28,000
Is Mikal with him?

1087
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:30,400
No.

1088
01:12:30,440 --> 01:12:31,600
Did he mention anything about her?

1089
01:12:31,680 --> 01:12:34,280
Not to me. Jump in.

1090
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:36,440
I can't. I gotta stay here
and wait for her.

1091
01:12:38,440 --> 01:12:39,840
How long you gonna wait, man?

1092
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:42,080
She's an adult.
She'll find her way back.

1093
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,720
What's Freddy doing here?

1094
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:53,640
Get in, dickhead.
We have a train to make.

1095
01:12:55,839 --> 01:12:56,839
Train?

1096
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,440
Get in.

1097
01:13:14,920 --> 01:13:17,280
So Kneller never did actually kill himself.

1098
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:18,800
No, of course not.

1099
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:20,600
He was working for
the People In Charge.

1100
01:13:20,680 --> 01:13:23,520
Undercover.

1101
01:13:23,560 --> 01:13:26,720
I always had a feeling
he was an angel or something.

1102
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:29,080
An angel? Come on.

1103
01:13:29,160 --> 01:13:30,200
Well...

1104
01:13:30,280 --> 01:13:32,120
So now that he blew his cover,

1105
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:35,960
he'll be transferred
out of the undercover unit.

1106
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:37,520
Transferred? Where's he going?

1107
01:13:37,600 --> 01:13:40,120
Don't know. Wherever
the People In Charge operate.

1108
01:13:41,880 --> 01:13:43,640
Looks like that's it.

1109
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:57,440
So camp is totally over?

1110
01:13:57,520 --> 01:13:59,520
Yup.

1111
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:04,560
Turns out Kneller ran it completely illegally.

1112
01:14:04,640 --> 01:14:06,720
And on the P. I.C. property, no less.

1113
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:13,600
So what are you gonna do?

1114
01:14:14,760 --> 01:14:16,160
I don't know.

1115
01:14:16,200 --> 01:14:18,480
I'm definitely gonna go back to camp
and wait for Mikal,

1116
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:21,760
but after that, I guess I'll see.

1117
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:26,280
You'll see?

1118
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:31,280
What?

1119
01:14:31,360 --> 01:14:34,000
Listen.

1120
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:36,960
I didn't want to tell you this.

1121
01:14:37,040 --> 01:14:41,040
According to Kneller, in the middle
of that whole Messiah hassle,

1122
01:14:41,120 --> 01:14:44,880
Mikal talked to one of
those P. I.C. guys and...

1123
01:14:44,960 --> 01:14:46,800
and asked him to check her file.

1124
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:48,680
And I know it sounds crazy,

1125
01:14:48,760 --> 01:14:51,760
but it turns out there really was
some kind of mistake,

1126
01:14:51,840 --> 01:14:54,440
and it looks like they'll be sending her back...

1127
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:56,200
back to life.

1128
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:09,200
It's a good thing, you know?

1129
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:10,880
'Cause she gets to go back.

1130
01:15:10,920 --> 01:15:12,800
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

1131
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:14,800
It is.

1132
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,760
I mean, it's what she wanted, so...

1133
01:15:22,680 --> 01:15:24,880
Take care of her.

1134
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,920
Bye, Nanuk.

1135
01:15:46,440 --> 01:15:47,800
Come here.

1136
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,720
See you, man.

1137
01:16:02,920 --> 01:16:07,880
Hey, don't forget to give
that package to my folks.

1138
01:16:22,920 --> 01:16:24,320
They went to the North Pole

1139
01:16:24,400 --> 01:16:27,440
or whatever the place
Nanuk is from is called.

1140
01:16:27,520 --> 01:16:29,000
He wanted to meet her family

1141
01:16:29,080 --> 01:16:30,920
and get into that throat singing,

1142
01:16:30,960 --> 01:16:34,520
saw playing, weird instruments,
and all that stuff.

1143
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:37,800
It's good that he's back into music, I think.

1144
01:17:38,760 --> 01:17:41,000
And me?

1145
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:42,680
I think I finally understand

1146
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:45,680
what Kneller was trying to say.

1147
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:48,840
It only happens if it doesn't matter.

1148
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:52,040
It comes without effort.

1149
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:58,000
Maybe Eugene's right.

1150
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:02,600
Maybe I only get stuck on girls
I don't have a chance of being with.

1151
01:18:03,720 --> 01:18:06,360
I am glad for Mikal, though.

1152
01:18:06,440 --> 01:18:08,800
I hope she got her visa
all straightened out.

1153
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:15,080
I mean, she did say
she'd be right back.

1154
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:19,440
Then again, Eugene's old wisdom
is when a girl says that,

1155
01:18:19,520 --> 01:18:22,000
she never does actually come back.

1156
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:27,720
So I don't know. Go figure it out.

1157
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:22,360
Zia, you are one lucky son of a bitch.

1158
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:27,120
Pays to know people
in high places, huh?
