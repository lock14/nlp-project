2
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,669
When we're winning

3
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:49,571
We'll be singing

4
00:01:50,877 --> 00:01:53,607
I get knocked down
but I get up again

5
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,341
You're never gonna
keep me down

6
00:01:55,415 --> 00:01:58,384
I get knocked down
but I get up again

7
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,248
You're never gonna
keep me down

8
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,652
I get knocked down
but I get up again

9
00:02:02,722 --> 00:02:04,849
You're never gonna
keep me down

10
00:02:04,924 --> 00:02:06,118
I get knocked down

11
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:09,628
Halloween just got awesome, bitches!

12
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,688
Prepare for the entrance of Lord Vader.

13
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:16,292
Give yourself to the Dark Side.

14
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:19,202
It's the only way you can save-

15
00:02:19,272 --> 00:02:21,263
You wore the same thing last year.

16
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,674
- You son of a bitch.
- I 'm sorry, guys. My codpiece is killing me.

17
00:02:24,744 --> 00:02:26,234
It's totally restricting my junk.

18
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,543
You're gonna spill it or fill it, dude?

19
00:02:29,616 --> 00:02:31,345
Zoe.

20
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:33,885
- Hi.
- Oh, my God. It's been a long time.

21
00:02:33,953 --> 00:02:36,421
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

22
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:40,425
You are...
something with tampons.

23
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,518
I'm Picasso's Blue Period.

24
00:02:42,595 --> 00:02:45,792
- Get it?. Blue Period.
- Hmm.

25
00:02:45,865 --> 00:02:47,992
And you are?.
Corporate sleaze?.

26
00:02:48,067 --> 00:02:50,058
Car salesman.

27
00:02:50,136 --> 00:02:52,331
I came straight from work, so this is-

28
00:02:52,405 --> 00:02:55,533
- Weak as usual, Bottler.
- Thank you.

29
00:02:55,608 --> 00:02:58,270
Are you here
for a reunion with the boys?.

30
00:02:58,344 --> 00:03:00,642
Nope. That's just a pleasant surprise.

31
00:03:00,713 --> 00:03:02,112
Watch the cape, uh, uh-

32
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:05,015
Well, enter at your own risk.

33
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:07,177
Oh, my God.

34
00:03:07,253 --> 00:03:09,551
You guys have both got to stop
perpetuating this myth...

35
00:03:09,622 --> 00:03:12,352
that Boba Fett is some kind of bad-ass.

36
00:03:12,425 --> 00:03:16,020
All right?. He has a jet pack.
So did the Rocketeer.

37
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,086
- Really cool.
- Here we go.

38
00:03:18,164 --> 00:03:21,565
When it comes time for battle, the man's
Michael Bay- all style, no substance.

39
00:03:21,634 --> 00:03:23,727
If you diss the Fett again...

40
00:03:23,803 --> 00:03:25,771
I will corn-holeyou with a lightsaber!.

41
00:03:25,838 --> 00:03:27,066
Whoop, there it is

42
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,904
-Jesus. Is that Bottler?.
-   Whoop, there it is

43
00:03:29,976 --> 00:03:31,443
- Hey, guys.
-   Whoop, there it is

44
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,103
Whoop, there it is

45
00:03:33,179 --> 00:03:34,942
Whoop, there it is

46
00:03:35,014 --> 00:03:36,311
Whoop, there it is

47
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:39,146
You got a lot of nerve
showing your face around here.

48
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,479
Give Daddy a huggy.

49
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:46,991
- Yeah!
- Stop.

50
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:49,051
You little bastard, I missed you.

51
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:51,926
I hope that's just your blaster poking me.

52
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:55,764
- God, it's been parsecs.
- Yeah, it's good to see you too, man.

53
00:03:55,835 --> 00:03:59,100
- Linus.
- Hmm.

54
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:02,903
- It's been, like, a year now, right?.
- Three.

55
00:04:02,976 --> 00:04:06,810
- You still drawing?.
- No. I bailed on that shit after high school.

56
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:10,440
- How's life in the auto trade?.
- Still second in command to the old man.

57
00:04:10,516 --> 00:04:12,108
Um, you?

58
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:14,210
Comic book store's still afloat...

59
00:04:14,287 --> 00:04:16,448
but the geeks aren't biting
like the old days.

60
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:21,221
- You?.
- Get my money together so I can
start my detailing business.

61
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:23,285
I'm gonna call it the Hutch Touch.

62
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:27,800
That's funny. I could've sworn you were
delivering pizza and living in your mom's garage.

63
00:04:27,867 --> 00:04:29,425
It's not a garage.

64
00:04:29,502 --> 00:04:31,800
It's a carriage house.

65
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:33,930
- Carriage house.

66
00:04:34,007 --> 00:04:37,602
- How is your carriage?.

67
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,882
Ah! Ah! Ah!

68
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,387
Hey, uh, have any of you guys
seen the phone jack?.

69
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:52,049
Uh, no, but I have seen
the social retard...

70
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:54,286
who brought his Toughbook to a party.

71
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,228
- I promised Rogue Leader
I'd write her back tonight.
- Oh, God.

72
00:04:58,298 --> 00:05:01,233
- She is my girlfriend.
- On-line girlfriend.

73
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:04,828
I met herin aJedi chat room.
The woman is perfect.

74
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:10,001
She's intelligent and acerbic and, uh-
and a die-hard fan.

75
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:12,203
She's even got connections
inside the Lucas camp.

76
00:05:12,278 --> 00:05:14,542
Who's also got
a man package anda goatee.

77
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:17,242
You guys are all just jealous
because she describes herself...

78
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:19,308
as a cross between
Sarah Michelle Gellar...

79
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:21,353
- and Janeane Garofalo.

80
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:23,150
Tell 'em how you described yourself.

81
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:25,486
I was perfectly honest with her.

82
00:05:25,558 --> 00:05:28,026
- You said you looked like
a white Billy Dee Williams.

83
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,562
You called yourself white chocolate.

84
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:33,428
- I am white chocolate.

85
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,797
- Oh, oh! Windows, it's my turn.

86
00:05:35,868 --> 00:05:38,098
- Give it to me.
- Midnight. Another day down.

87
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,230
Ah! Okay.

88
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,399
Official Episode I countdown...

89
00:05:42,475 --> 00:05:46,741
is six months, 12 days,
eight hours and some change.

90
00:05:46,813 --> 00:05:50,510
I would sell my soul to see
that movie right here right now.

91
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,017
Dude, I wouldsell myleft nut.
And I onlyhave the one nut.

92
00:05:53,086 --> 00:05:58,353
- So you see how serious I am?.
- I cannot listen to this shit
for another six months.

93
00:05:58,424 --> 00:06:01,951
Oh, shush your mouth, woman.
You know, we could see the movie.

94
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:09,362
- Oh, please, not this again.
- Oh, yes, please, this again.

95
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,960
""Tell us about
the rabbits, George. George."

96
00:06:12,038 --> 00:06:13,938
Imagine.

97
00:06:14,006 --> 00:06:15,268
Okay?

98
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:19,402
We drive across the country in one night.

99
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:24,314
We break into the Skywalker Ranch...

100
00:06:24,384 --> 00:06:26,648
and steal ourselves a print.

101
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:31,279
- Yeah!

102
00:06:31,357 --> 00:06:34,417
You guys have been talking about this
since the fifth grade, okay?.

103
00:06:34,494 --> 00:06:37,088
- It's not gonna happen.
- Why the hell not?.

104
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:39,154
Well, first of all, it's 2,000 miles away.

105
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:42,497
Second of all, even ifyou could get there,
you'd be arrested.

106
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:44,627
It's been a blast, Bottler.

107
00:06:45,938 --> 00:06:48,463
Way to douche up the party.

108
00:06:48,541 --> 00:06:50,771
Nothing is impossible.

109
00:06:54,247 --> 00:06:59,344
And I'll guarantee I'll find you a new
or used car, or my name isn't Big Chuck.

110
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:02,479
- Right, girls?.
- Ooh-hoo!

111
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,113
Hoo!

112
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:06,784
Yeah!

113
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:08,326
All right!

114
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:11,727
Attaboy, Eric.
Now, see, that's some slick advertising.

115
00:07:11,798 --> 00:07:13,163
Thanks, Pop.

116
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,598
Reminds me of, what, that
Terry Bruckheimer movies.

117
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,363
[Man ]
Yeah. Top Gun.

118
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,169
- Thanks.
- Hiya, Eric.

119
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,809
I'll handle this, Myron.
Thanks.

120
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,679
- Hey.
- We're in the market for some used droids.

121
00:07:31,751 --> 00:07:33,776
I should start you guys off
with a new set of wheels first...

122
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,413
unless you're cool riding
around in the same rusted old shit box...

123
00:07:36,489 --> 00:07:38,480
you've had since the 10th grade.

124
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,583
Hey, hey, hey!

125
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,857
She may not look like much,
but she's got it where it counts.

126
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:46,364
Uh, why are you guys here?.

127
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,798
Do you wanna look around the lot a little bit,
drive something?. What?.

128
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:51,462
No. Uh, we came to talk about Linus.

129
00:07:51,537 --> 00:07:54,028
Well, he just needs to realize
that people lose touch.

130
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:56,574
- That's just kind of the waythings work.
- He's dying, Eric.

131
00:07:57,577 --> 00:08:00,671
- What?.
- He's got cancer, man.

132
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:05,479
He's tried everything to get better,
but nothing seems to work.

133
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:08,543
Odds say three, four months maybe.

134
00:08:08,621 --> 00:08:10,816
And you guys are telling me this now?.

135
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:12,983
We wanted to tell you
months ago, honestly...

136
00:08:13,059 --> 00:08:15,857
but Linus made us promise
not to say anything.

137
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:19,728
The way we see it,you guys have been
best friends since, like, first grade.

138
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:23,394
So we figured you got the right to know.
You got the right to make your peace.

139
00:08:23,469 --> 00:08:27,599
How am I supposed to make my peace
when the guy doesn't even want me to know?.

140
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:30,403
With all due respect, Eric,
this isn't about you.

141
00:08:32,311 --> 00:08:34,871
- I- You know what?.
- Holy shit.

142
00:08:34,947 --> 00:08:39,884
-Jesus Christ.
- Ifit ain't C-3Penis Face and R2-Dickhead.

143
00:08:39,952 --> 00:08:41,943
What did you just say, you giant bastard?.

144
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,080
- Well, well put.
- Thank you.

145
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:47,057
- Still see you're driving the nerd-mobile.
- Chaz, you're an idiot.

146
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:50,254
Hey, you know what?. While you're out here
sticking G.I. Joes up your butt...

147
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,889
I convinced Dad to let me
recut the commercial.

148
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:55,024
So suck it. Huh?.

149
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:58,628
Aw, see,you flinched.
That's gonna be two, Princess Leia.

150
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:00,695
Nanu-nanu.

151
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:03,435
Get a haircut.

152
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:06,876
- We should have killed him
when we had the chance.
- Yeah.

153
00:09:06,946 --> 00:09:10,473
Jackass. Linus is coming over
to the carriage house later. So are you.

154
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:12,882
Bye, Eric.

155
00:09:19,825 --> 00:09:21,884
No lightning! No lightning!

156
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:25,519
- Aw, shit. I'm a midget.
- I'm gonna flatten your ass right now.

157
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:29,057
Ah!
Suck it, Count Fagula.

158
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,932
Wow!

159
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,403
- There's no teaming up.
That's a rule!

160
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:35,736
Ow! Head cramp!

161
00:09:35,808 --> 00:09:37,799
Don't kill me.

162
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:40,568
- Hey.
- Donkeyballs.

163
00:09:40,646 --> 00:09:42,477
You made it, man.

164
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:50,045
Your mom said clean up this shit-hole
orno grilled cheese for a week?

165
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:52,181
That's emotional blackmail,
and you know it!

166
00:09:52,258 --> 00:09:55,523
- Screwyou!
- I will sue you! Renter's rights!

167
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,758
- You don't payrent!
- Damn. Damn!

168
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:01,664
- What the hell is he doing here, man?.
- It was Hutch's idea.

169
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:03,759
Grab a controller.

170
00:10:03,836 --> 00:10:05,827
We're ganging up on Windows in Mario Kart.

171
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:08,931
I can't.
I came to talk to Linus actually.

172
00:10:10,142 --> 00:10:12,702
Can I talk toyou alone, man?

173
00:10:14,714 --> 00:10:18,673
Linus. Hey, stop walking.
Linus! Hold up, man.

174
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:23,620
- Stop. What the hell, man?.
I did nothing to you.
- Exactly. You did nothing.

175
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,623
Absolutel ynothing.

176
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:27,784
Eric Bottler graduates high school
and never looks back.

177
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:30,124
You bailed on our plan, Bottler!

178
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:32,221
What plan?.
To be the next big thing in comics?.

179
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:34,289
Come on, man.
That was never gonna happen.

180
00:10:34,367 --> 00:10:38,394
I did what I had to do, dude. I grew up.
I'm the only one who did.

181
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,905
- Look at you guys.
- You can fool everybody...

182
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:43,533
with this cheap suit,
salesman-of-the-year pitch.

183
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,634
But I know you better than anybody...

184
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:50,114
and deep down,
you are one miserable son of a bitch.

185
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:52,980
- Miserable, huh?.
- Yeah. Miserable.

186
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:56,385
Miserable is wasting your life
in Hutch's garage playing video games...

187
00:10:56,455 --> 00:10:58,389
arguing whether or not
Luke really had a thing for Leia.

188
00:10:58,457 --> 00:11:02,120
You know as well as anybody...

189
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:06,255
that as soon as Luke knew Leia
was his sister, it was hands off.

190
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,594
They still kiss.

191
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,727
That was Leia kissing Luke
to make Han jealous.

192
00:11:10,803 --> 00:11:12,566
That was the second time.
The first time-

193
00:11:12,638 --> 00:11:14,629
The first time they're about to die!

194
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:17,767
- Theywere not, you liar.
- They were swinging 30,000 feet in the air.

195
00:11:17,843 --> 00:11:20,937
You know when you're a sibling, okay?.
There's something innate.

196
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:24,244
- There's no telepathy between
Luke and Leia till Episode VI.
- It spans the ocean.

197
00:11:24,316 --> 00:11:26,443
It was romance in a sci-fi opera!

198
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,680
Who cares about this shit, man?. Huh?.

199
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:32,588
- Who cares about-
- I do. I care.

200
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,630
- You need a new car.

201
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:51,302
They were siblings.
They were siblings, you sick bastard!

202
00:11:54,513 --> 00:11:57,744
You are trapped now.

203
00:11:57,817 --> 00:12:00,752
You've made your last mistake.

204
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,321
We need to talk.

205
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,458
Sure, Pop.
What's up?.

206
00:12:16,669 --> 00:12:18,796
Okay. Here's the deal.

207
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:22,773
It's time forthe world
to see the new face ofthis company.

208
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:25,436
And his name's Big Eric.

209
00:12:25,511 --> 00:12:27,308
Big Eric who?.

210
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:30,280
- Big Eric you.

211
00:12:30,349 --> 00:12:33,443
It's all yours, kiddo.
The entire shebang.

212
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,851
All 15 locations, from here to Seattle.

213
00:12:35,921 --> 00:12:39,618
- I mean- Uh, yes.

214
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:42,684
Yeah. I mean, wow.

215
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:45,822
- Take the hat.
- I can't take your hat.

216
00:12:45,898 --> 00:12:47,456
Go ahead.

217
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,296
No, really.
It looks good on you.

218
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:50,630
- Take the hat.
- But it's really-

219
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:55,140
- Take the damn hat.
- Yeah. I'll wear it for-

220
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:58,665
My God. Your mom would be so proud
to see you in that hat.

221
00:12:58,744 --> 00:13:00,769
I know, Pop.

222
00:13:00,846 --> 00:13:04,543
Hey. You and me?.
Tanning Tuesdays?.

223
00:13:11,590 --> 00:13:14,821
You want to take your shirt off.

224
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:23,129
You want to take your shirt off. God.

225
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:26,035
- You wanna take that shirt off?.
- Asshole.

226
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:29,040
You have been trying that Jedi mind shit
on me since the eighth grade.

227
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:32,544
- It doesn't work.
- Oh, it works. Tell her, Windows.

228
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:35,239
- He's been geeking out
with Rogue Leader all morning.

229
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,714
Nothing can tearhim away.

230
00:13:37,783 --> 00:13:41,082
- Ah!
- Rogue Leader,you are wicked.

231
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:45,214
Ah, I love the feeling of fresh air
on my naked breasts.

232
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,816
Oh, ho-ho!

233
00:13:47,893 --> 00:13:51,192
See that?.
Man's immune to sweateryams.

234
00:13:51,263 --> 00:13:54,528
What about me?.
I like sweateryams!

235
00:13:57,203 --> 00:13:58,693
Hey.

236
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,871
What'll it be, fellas?.

237
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,713
- How much for the phaser gun?.
- For the phaser gun?

238
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:16,846
Sorry, Garfunkel.
We don't hock Trek here.

239
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:19,550
Well, then, Slim,
if you don't sell the Trek...

240
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:22,423
then why do you have
a phaser gun in the case?.

241
00:14:22,494 --> 00:14:25,793
We keep this one here to suss out
Trekkie bitches like yourself...

242
00:14:25,865 --> 00:14:27,890
and tell them to get
the hell off of our land.

243
00:14:27,967 --> 00:14:30,299
So get the hell off of our land.

244
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:34,601
Get the hell off of our land!
Get the hell out ofhere! Now!

245
00:14:34,673 --> 00:14:38,234
Get out of here,
you Kirk-lovin' Spock-suckers!

246
00:14:44,316 --> 00:14:47,444
- Hey.
- Hey.

247
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,613
You guys know where a guy can pawn off
a first edition Eric Bottler comic?.

248
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,384
- Hey!
- Holy cannolis.

249
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,483
Look at that.
Yeah. That's awesome.

250
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,996
Dude, you had sick skills back then.
You should've stuck with it, brother.

251
00:14:58,063 --> 00:15:00,759
Yeah. I would've been broke and living
in my parents' garage.

252
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:03,495
- It's a carriage house.
- Right. I know it is.

253
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,732
I have something else
that you guys might wanna check out.

254
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:13,235
Well, what have we got here?.

255
00:15:13,312 --> 00:15:17,408
Ohio to Califor-
Is this what I think it is?

256
00:15:17,483 --> 00:15:19,951
Linus laid the whole thing out in fifth grade.

257
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:22,920
I figure it's time
for another epic journey, isn't it?

258
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:24,853
What's your game plan?.

259
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,654
We storm the ranch, or we die trying.

260
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:29,318
Yeah.

261
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:33,629
Well, you guys were
all about this at the party.

262
00:15:33,699 --> 00:15:36,190
- We were six Zimas to the wind at the party.
- Drunk.

263
00:15:36,268 --> 00:15:40,295
Come on. You even said the Rogue Leader
has connections inside the ranch, right?.

264
00:15:40,372 --> 00:15:43,273
Rogue Leader? Please, man.
Windows never even met him.

265
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,310
- Her!
- Him.

266
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:48,540
- Maybe it's time that he does.
- Dude, this is a suicide mission, man.

267
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,605
Why would we even try anything like this?.

268
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:52,810
For Linus.

269
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,286
- Huh?.

270
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,453
No.

271
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,055
- No?.
- No. I'm not going.

272
00:16:07,132 --> 00:16:09,396
Aw, Linus, you've got to go.

273
00:16:09,468 --> 00:16:12,028
This is a conquest for the ages.

274
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:14,038
Our names shall become legend...

275
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:17,564
spoken in hushed tones
by nerds across the galaxy.

276
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:19,736
And we'll get laid.

277
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:24,347
More than
we've ever been laid

278
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:33,356
- Okay, please stop that.
- Sorry. I was getting into that.

279
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,721
I just don't wanna go
with Opie over there.

280
00:16:37,796 --> 00:16:41,095
Check this out, man.

281
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:54,069
Floor plans to the Lucas Ranch.

282
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:57,741
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- Areyou kidding?. How did you get these?.

283
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:00,944
My life partner, Rogue Leader,
she can break us in, man.

284
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:03,716
The question you got to ask yourself is...

285
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,280
"Doyou have the nut sack
to go through with it?"'

286
00:17:13,499 --> 00:17:15,729
Ifl do this, it doesn't change anything.

287
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:24,901
I'll grab my suitcase
and some Big League Chew.

288
00:17:24,977 --> 00:17:27,912
- Yes!
- ThunderCats! Ho!

289
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,141
- Told you. I knew he'd go.
- Stop humping.

290
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,706
Please stop humping.
Just high five.

291
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,777
- Oh, God. I' m Jabba the Hump.
- Oh, goddamn it.

292
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:38,687
- Chewie!
- Chewie! Damn it!

293
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,829
Wait a second. Whoa.
What the hell's Chewie?

294
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:48,492
It's the same rules as shotgun.
Eitherway, I always lose.

295
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,536
- Furball, you do the honors?.
- Yeah.

296
00:17:54,173 --> 00:17:56,505
Strap in, fellas.

297
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:02,073
Whoo!

298
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:11,118
What the hell, Hutch?.
It's all Rush.

299
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,182
- Ever want a little variety?.
- Rush is variety, bitch.

300
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,784
- Oh!

301
00:18:16,862 --> 00:18:21,231
Rule number one:.
in myvan, it's Rush.

302
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:23,700
All Rush, all the time.

303
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,168
No exceptions.

304
00:18:25,237 --> 00:18:27,797
Rule number two:.

305
00:18:27,873 --> 00:18:30,000
nobody touch the red button.

306
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:34,307
And I mean never touch the red button.

307
00:18:34,379 --> 00:18:38,611
Most importantly,
rule number three:

308
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,948
there's no jerking it in my van.

309
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,010
What?.

310
00:18:43,088 --> 00:18:46,148
- Fine.

311
00:18:47,826 --> 00:18:51,489
Don't roll your eyes at me, Admiral Jackbar.

312
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:55,558
""Established in 1985...

313
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,727
""the Skywalker Ranch
is the headquarters...

314
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,237
of George Lucas's filmmaking empire."

315
00:19:00,305 --> 00:19:02,296
So according to Rogue Leader's map...

316
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:06,572
our best odds for finding
the film is in here- the main house.

317
00:19:06,645 --> 00:19:10,308
Oh, my God.
That place is legendary.

318
00:19:10,382 --> 00:19:14,045
And we meet Rogue Leader at a coffee shop
in Texas Wednesday, 3:.00 p.m. sharp.

319
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:16,451
- Mm-hmm.
- She's gonna give us
absolutely everything we need...

320
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,547
- to get into the compound.
- Nice.

321
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:20,819
White chocolate finally gets
to meet his dream girl.

322
00:19:20,893 --> 00:19:23,726
- Oh!
- Ooh! Ooh!

323
00:19:23,795 --> 00:19:27,196
Well, according to this,
80 West is our fastest route.

324
00:19:27,266 --> 00:19:31,066
So we got 26 hours
to make it to Texas, boys.

325
00:19:31,136 --> 00:19:33,366
Consider it done.

326
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,602
Ah!

327
00:19:47,986 --> 00:19:52,889
- Wakey, wakey. Hands off steakey.

328
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:57,019
- It's time for Hutch's pit stop.
- Where are we?.

329
00:19:57,095 --> 00:20:00,531
Some say heaven.
I like to call it Iowa.

330
00:20:00,599 --> 00:20:03,033
Iowa?.
What about Rogue Leader?.

331
00:20:03,101 --> 00:20:06,730
- Iowa?.
- Yeah. I made a little detour.

332
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:08,739
Hutch, we're supposed
to be going to Texas.

333
00:20:08,807 --> 00:20:10,775
Welcome to Riverside, gentlemen...

334
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:16,109
future birthplace ofone
CaptainJames T. Kirk.

335
00:20:16,181 --> 00:20:19,207
Enemy territory! Nice.

336
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:22,651
- Man, you drove all night for this?.

337
00:20:22,721 --> 00:20:25,417
Dude, I'd drive all year for the chance
to pimp slap some Trekkies.

338
00:20:25,490 --> 00:20:27,788
You know what?
Leave me out of it.

339
00:20:32,030 --> 00:20:34,055
Let's crack some Trekkie skulls!

340
00:20:34,132 --> 00:20:36,066
Let's do it!

341
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,899
And it is believed
that on this very spot...

342
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:46,138
Captain James Tiberius Kirkwill be born.

343
00:20:46,211 --> 00:20:49,806
Hence, the statue immortalizing him...

344
00:20:49,881 --> 00:20:53,908
grappling with his most accursed nemesis.

345
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:56,284
Ricardo Montalban?.

346
00:20:56,355 --> 00:20:59,415
Genetically engineered tyrant Khan.

347
00:20:59,491 --> 00:21:02,255
- It doesn't look like either of them.
- Thank you forpointing that out.

348
00:21:02,327 --> 00:21:05,728
That is because the whores at Viacom
International threatened to sue us...

349
00:21:05,797 --> 00:21:08,322
if we used their likenesses,
so we make do.

350
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:11,164
Yes. The gentleman in the beige.

351
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:15,036
I was wondering what did Sulu find
in Captain Kirk's lavatory.

352
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:20,010
Sulu clearly found a standard issue
Starfleet Z23 personal refuse device.

353
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:22,603
I believe it was the Captain's log.

354
00:21:22,681 --> 00:21:24,546
- Very good.

355
00:21:24,616 --> 00:21:28,882
A laugh a day keeps the doctor away, everyone.
We've been saved.

356
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:31,320
- Ooh.
- Any other comic relief?.

357
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:33,551
- Ah!
- There's still homeless out there.

358
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,116
- Hey!
- Yes! What?. You! What?. Yes.

359
00:21:36,194 --> 00:21:41,029
What is the Klingon translation
for, "You're gonna die a virgin"?

360
00:21:47,839 --> 00:21:51,741
Yeah. Yeah. Okay.
Hilarious, everyone.

361
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:55,007
Looks like we got more Lucas hounds
here to mock Roddenberry.

362
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,173
Congratulations, gentlemen,
but I would like to see...

363
00:21:57,249 --> 00:22:00,582
your Darth Vader take on one Borg drone.

364
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:03,018
And we'll see who's laughing then.
Am I right?.

365
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:08,025
Darth Vader can put the entire
Borg collective in a vice grip with his mind.

366
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,323
Uh, Darth Vader has asthma...

367
00:22:10,395 --> 00:22:14,161
so name me one Star Trek character
with a respiratory disease...

368
00:22:14,232 --> 00:22:16,325
'cause I'm drawing a blank.

369
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:18,164
Name me one
Star Wars characterwho's gay.

370
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:19,760
- Yeah.
- Besides you.

371
00:22:19,838 --> 00:22:23,103
Well, no one's gay in Star Trek,
so whywould I even do that?.

372
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:24,506
Captain Picard.

373
00:22:24,576 --> 00:22:27,545
Captain Picard is not gay.
He's British.

374
00:22:27,612 --> 00:22:30,911
- Come on. ""Make it so!"
-   Ah-ah

375
00:22:30,982 --> 00:22:34,782
I hate to break it to you losers,
but Han Solo's a bitch.

376
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:36,912
Ah, no, he didn't. No, he didn't.

377
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:39,479
What did you just say?.

378
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:44,484
- Is there a problem here?.
- Yeah, there sure is, Spock.

379
00:22:44,563 --> 00:22:47,225
The admiral here just
called Han Solo a bitch.

380
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:50,291
- Good one.
- Some pretty strong words for a Trekkie.

381
00:22:50,369 --> 00:22:53,031
A Trekkie is derogatory
at this point in the game.

382
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,232
Trekker is what we're called now.
Trekker.

383
00:22:55,307 --> 00:22:57,138
Oh, I'm sorry.
Trekkie.

384
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,970
-Just take a look-see here.

385
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,743
What's with the man-purse?.

386
00:23:04,816 --> 00:23:07,250
- Yep. As I thought...

387
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:11,278
- scanner reads ""douche bag."

388
00:23:20,031 --> 00:23:24,127
- Push me, I'll kill your whole Starfleet.

389
00:23:24,202 --> 00:23:25,897
- Unbelievable!

390
00:23:27,205 --> 00:23:29,070
Snikt! Snitk!
Come on, bub!

391
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:31,132
Attack, you cowards!
That's an order!

392
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:34,635
- Hutch!
- Coverme, Windows!

393
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:40,184
Evasive maneuvers!
Evasive maneuvers!

394
00:23:57,869 --> 00:24:01,498
- My ear!
- Ha-ha!

395
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:03,973
Nighty-night, Spock-sucker.

396
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:09,140
Beam this, bitch!

397
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:12,547
Time-out!
I call time-out! Time-out!

398
00:24:20,192 --> 00:24:22,888
- Disable theirvehicle.
- Get in! Go!

399
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:25,327
Get in the van!
Get in the van!

400
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:26,694
Disable the vehicle.

401
00:24:29,301 --> 00:24:31,462
Kill the Star-roids!

402
00:24:31,536 --> 00:24:34,403
Get them!

403
00:24:34,473 --> 00:24:37,636
Han Solo is still a bitch!

404
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:41,509
- Nobody calls Han Solo a bitch.

405
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:48,347
Yeah!

406
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:57,661
Hey, Bottler, hit 'em
with the pressed ham!

407
00:24:58,797 --> 00:25:01,357
Klingon to this.

408
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:10,539
Kha-a-a-an!

409
00:25:13,979 --> 00:25:19,007
Kha-a-a-an!

410
00:25:24,289 --> 00:25:27,053
Whoo!

411
00:25:27,125 --> 00:25:29,923
I took that Vulcan down hard.

412
00:25:29,995 --> 00:25:33,260
I rolled him into the dirt
like he was my frickin' tauntaun.

413
00:25:33,331 --> 00:25:38,132
Tauntaun, my ass. If it wasn't forme,
you guys would all be dead.

414
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:41,138
What fight were you watching?
I was channeling the emperor.

415
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:45,370
The emperor? I don't remember the emperor
crapping his robe and screaming ""time-out. "

416
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:48,412
- Oh, my God. That's right.
- There is such a thing as time-out.

417
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,075
I can feel
your anger growing inside. Wait. Time-out.

418
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:04,120
All right. Time-out.

419
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,224
We had to take yourvan, Hutch.

420
00:26:06,298 --> 00:26:09,995
I have access to literally
thousands ofvehicles...

421
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:12,161
but we had to take yourvan.

422
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,797
Yeah, well, I had a spare tire...

423
00:26:14,873 --> 00:26:18,309
but some tardo took it out
to make some room for his grappling hook.

424
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:20,776
What?. We're on a covert operation.

425
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:23,336
How can you be on a covert operation
without a grappling hook?.

426
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,610
Oh! Wait.

427
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:28,414
What in Greedo's name is that?

428
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,423
Talk about a wretched hive
of scum and villainy.

429
00:26:34,492 --> 00:26:36,722
Hmm.

430
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:39,525
You guys stay right here.
I 'll take care of this.

431
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:42,465
How you doing, fellas?.
Hi, fellas.

432
00:26:42,534 --> 00:26:44,661
So our car broke down
a couple of miles back.

433
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:47,500
Is there anyone you know who can help us?.

434
00:26:47,572 --> 00:26:49,870
No.

435
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:53,308
Can I have some water?.

436
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:54,777
Yeah, a glass of water, please.

437
00:26:54,846 --> 00:26:56,871
Great.

438
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,347
Pirate teeth.
Pirate teeth.

439
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:06,515
- Pirate teeth. Don't.
- Thank you.

440
00:27:06,591 --> 00:27:08,286
A hundred bucks.

441
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:12,057
For a glass ofwater?.
That's ridiculous. I'm not gonna pay that.

442
00:27:12,130 --> 00:27:13,859
Sure you will.

443
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,833
Hell, no. Hell, no.
Back up, buddy. Back off.

444
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:21,697
Word to the wise, ese.

445
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:26,437
- Ooh!
- Drop the tough-ass biker
routine before I get angry.

446
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:28,672
And you won't like me when I'm angry.

447
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:30,840
Hmm, I think I would.

448
00:27:30,915 --> 00:27:32,940
- Hutch, let's not do this.
- Hutch, maybe-

449
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:34,576
Nah. Nah. Nah.

450
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:38,521
This guy wants
to dick with me, fine. I can dick.

451
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:44,324
I used to rape guys 15 times
your size in prison.

452
00:27:44,396 --> 00:27:46,921
Soyou best back off...

453
00:27:46,998 --> 00:27:50,024
- or, so help me God, I'm
gonna pound your ass so hard-
- Oh, Jesus.

454
00:27:50,101 --> 00:27:51,932
- No. Hutch.
- What?.

455
00:27:52,003 --> 00:27:54,233
- There's kind ofa thing in this bar. Like that.
- See?.

456
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:57,741
Ixnay on the ass pounding.

457
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:03,543
A hundred dollars?.
That's cool.

458
00:28:03,615 --> 00:28:07,676
Afraid it's too late for that, ese.

459
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:11,051
Our midnight entertainment bailed.

460
00:28:11,122 --> 00:28:13,113
Time to pay for that drink.

461
00:28:15,293 --> 00:28:19,252
Oh, dear God.
We're gonna die up here, aren't we?.

462
00:28:20,932 --> 00:28:22,957
We have to strip to Menudo?.

463
00:28:24,202 --> 00:28:27,296
You got a problem with Menudo?.
Now, take it off!.

464
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:34,345
That's it, man!

465
00:28:34,412 --> 00:28:36,573
""Nobody puts Baby in a corner!"'

466
00:28:37,949 --> 00:28:40,474
You want some Swayze action, bitches?.

467
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,782
Yeah!
You like that, huh?.

468
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:45,379
- Whoo!

469
00:28:45,457 --> 00:28:47,049
Whoo!

470
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:57,929
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it, and you're gonna like it!

471
00:29:00,505 --> 00:29:02,735
He's got one ball.
Un testiculo.

472
00:29:02,807 --> 00:29:06,072
- Oh, that's disgusting.

473
00:29:06,144 --> 00:29:09,671
Okay, I had a...

474
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:13,240
torrid lightsaber battle
went wrong when I was a child.

475
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:17,084
All right, all right, all right.
Show's over, fellas.

476
00:29:20,558 --> 00:29:23,755
- You boys took a wrong turn?.
- Our car broke down.

477
00:29:23,828 --> 00:29:26,592
The Chief can fix it.

478
00:29:26,664 --> 00:29:28,757
The Chief?.

479
00:29:41,179 --> 00:29:44,808
This is some kick-ass guac
you whipped up, man.

480
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:48,848
- I feel funny.
- Tingly.

481
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,287
- I feel good.
- Karate is cool.

482
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:01,296
Guys, I don't thinkwe're eating...

483
00:30:01,366 --> 00:30:04,699
your everyday garden-variety guacamole.

484
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:06,794
I got recipe from Emeril.

485
00:30:06,871 --> 00:30:10,807
Avocado, onion,
chopped garlic- Bam!

486
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:12,740
- Bam!
- Bam!

487
00:30:12,811 --> 00:30:14,972
And the Chief's secret ingredient.

488
00:30:15,046 --> 00:30:18,573
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

489
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,345
Oh, myGod.
Oh, myGod.

490
00:30:20,418 --> 00:30:22,579
- What?.
- What?.

491
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,646
- There's an ewok right beside you.

492
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:31,527
Oh, wow. She's humping your leg.
It's humping your leg.

493
00:30:32,931 --> 00:30:35,331
She's humping your leg.
I love you.

494
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,095
Wahh!

495
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:49,377
Death is but a path to life,
a passage to the stars...

496
00:30:49,447 --> 00:30:51,438
to the universe.

497
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,780
I know what you mean.

498
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,878
You mean the Force.

499
00:30:56,955 --> 00:30:59,924
The Force.

500
00:30:59,991 --> 00:31:03,449
Guys, my dad is
gonna kill me if I don't get to work on Monday.

501
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:08,124
Putz. Screw it, man.

502
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,970
- No!
-Join me, Son.

503
00:31:19,510 --> 00:31:22,206
Come to the Dark Side.

504
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:24,612
- The Dark Side.
- No! No!

505
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:35,952
Rogue Leader.

506
00:31:36,027 --> 00:31:38,427
What the hell you doing, man?.
You're poking me.

507
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:40,828
Oh, God. Don't flatter yourself, okay?.

508
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:42,423
It's just my R2.
My lucky R2.

509
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:45,697
Man,you wish you had
the height and girth of D2.

510
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:51,165
- Yeah!
- Wow!

511
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,336
Hah! Van!

512
00:31:54,412 --> 00:31:57,939
Son of a whore!
The Buce is back.

513
00:31:59,017 --> 00:32:01,485
The Chief fixed it while you were asleep.

514
00:32:01,552 --> 00:32:04,578
The Chief fixed it.
Is he around?. Can we thank him?.

515
00:32:06,157 --> 00:32:08,751
He's the Chief.
You're the Chief, aren'tyou?.

516
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:13,854
- Why didn't you say so?.
- The Chief likes to refer to
himself in the third person.

517
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:16,696
It causes confusion,
especiallywith the bitches.

518
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:21,432
Well, you're cool as balls,
you burned-out old hash-head.

519
00:32:21,506 --> 00:32:24,134
WonderTwins power activate.

520
00:32:25,343 --> 00:32:27,777
It's been interesting.

521
00:32:29,347 --> 00:32:31,679
Thanks.

522
00:32:31,749 --> 00:32:33,842
You need it more than I do.

523
00:32:33,918 --> 00:32:36,318
- Wow. Thank you. I, uh-

524
00:32:38,556 --> 00:32:41,024
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

525
00:32:42,126 --> 00:32:44,117
Who's up forTexas, boys?.

526
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:47,564
Lump was limp andlonely
and needed a shove

527
00:32:47,598 --> 00:32:51,159
Lump slipped on a kiss
and tumbled into love

528
00:32:51,235 --> 00:32:54,261
She spent her 20s
between the sheets

529
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:58,139
Life limped along
at subsonic speeds

530
00:32:58,209 --> 00:33:01,372
-   She's lump, she's lump
She's in my head
- H i.

531
00:33:03,881 --> 00:33:06,145
- Hey-
-   She's lump, she's lump, she's lump

532
00:33:06,217 --> 00:33:08,242
- Yeah!
-   She might be dead

533
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:13,685
-   Ah

534
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:16,989
Bah
Ba-ba, ba-da-da-da

535
00:33:17,061 --> 00:33:20,189
Bah

536
00:33:20,264 --> 00:33:24,257
- Yes!
-   Bah, ba-ba, ba-da-da-da

537
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:27,202
Thank you for the blue balls, ladies!

538
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:41,774
Harrison Ford
is the greatest actor of all time!

539
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:43,844
In the history of cinema?.

540
00:33:43,921 --> 00:33:46,788
He's Han Solo, Indiana Jones. Yes!

541
00:33:46,858 --> 00:33:49,122
- Deckard from Blade Runner.
- Yes. Exactly.

542
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:51,218
Greatest actor of all time.

543
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:54,560
He's never done a bad movie.

544
00:33:57,602 --> 00:33:59,797
Does that sign say "electric fence"?.
Watch this. Ready?.

545
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:06,600
Is this lump outta myhead

546
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:09,976
Let's just hope she's still here.

547
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:14,414
Oh, she'll be here.

548
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:18,319
Give her a taste of that white chocolate.

549
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,879
What do you think?.

550
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:21,720
- Oh, my God.

551
00:34:21,793 --> 00:34:23,055
- 'Toid me.
- You ready?.

552
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:26,153
- Yeah. Thank you.
- Nice.

553
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:28,323
- Go get her.

554
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:45,611
Where have you been
all my life, sweet baby

555
00:34:45,683 --> 00:34:47,514
Girl, I've been waiting

556
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:51,419
For a while now

557
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:55,186
- Hi there.
-   Yes, I have

558
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,750
- Oh, my God!
-   There's a star in the sky

559
00:34:57,829 --> 00:34:59,626
That shines brightly on you

560
00:34:59,697 --> 00:35:03,565
When that pretty dress
that you're wearing

561
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:06,762
- Makes you so fine

562
00:35:06,838 --> 00:35:08,806
Rogue Leader, I presume?.

563
00:35:08,873 --> 00:35:10,272
Red 6?.

564
00:35:10,341 --> 00:35:13,310
Let me just put my glasses on.

565
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:14,867
What the hell?.

566
00:35:16,681 --> 00:35:18,615
You're a kid.
You're 12.

567
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,617
- I'm 10.
- You're 10?

568
00:35:20,685 --> 00:35:24,712
- I'm a pedophile! I'm a pedophile!

569
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:26,848
- I'm a pedophile!
- Give us a moment, please.

570
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:29,688
I have to leave this state at once.

571
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,955
- Yea! Yea!

572
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:34,156
That was fantastic.

573
00:35:34,232 --> 00:35:36,564
We drove a thousand miles, Windows.

574
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:38,158
A thousand.
For what?.

575
00:35:38,236 --> 00:35:41,399
So you can get funky
with Strawberry Shortcakes?.

576
00:35:41,472 --> 00:35:43,497
It's not really sex if it's cyber-sex.

577
00:35:43,574 --> 00:35:46,441
Relax. We're gonna sit down.
We're gonna put on our thinking caps.

578
00:35:46,511 --> 00:35:48,536
- And we're gonna get a better plan.
- No, it's-

579
00:35:48,613 --> 00:35:51,081
I have to be back by Monday.

580
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:54,175
I haven't told you guys this yet, but my-

581
00:35:54,252 --> 00:35:56,379
My dad gave me the company.

582
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,615
- Hey!
- Thanks, man.

583
00:35:58,689 --> 00:36:00,748
Yeah, the whole thing.
The whole thing is mine now.

584
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:04,591
What's the new game plan?.

585
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:06,653
Let's get in the van
and get the hell out of here.

586
00:36:06,731 --> 00:36:10,292
- This is just a minor setback.
- It's a minor setback for you.

587
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,269
I live in the real world, okay?.
I have to go back to work.

588
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,932
You have to go back
to... your mom's garage.

589
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:18,999
[ Inhales ]

590
00:36:20,578 --> 00:36:23,741
- It's a carriage house.
- It's a garage, man.

591
00:36:23,814 --> 00:36:25,406
- Say it again.
- It's a garage.

592
00:36:25,483 --> 00:36:26,882
- Excuse me. Excuse me.
- Guys!

593
00:36:26,951 --> 00:36:30,512
- Holding my schlong!
- Okay! Okay.

594
00:36:30,588 --> 00:36:33,352
- Harry Knowles.
- Harry who?

595
00:36:33,424 --> 00:36:36,916
- Hello.
- This man is the ultimate fanboy, Eric.

596
00:36:36,994 --> 00:36:41,693
His Web site "Ain't it Cool News"
is like every geek's homepage.

597
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:43,859
Which one of you's Windows?.

598
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:45,562
Me.

599
00:36:45,636 --> 00:36:47,729
I'm Windows.

600
00:36:47,805 --> 00:36:49,898
- Nice to meet you-
- Oh!

601
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:52,966
- Back off!.

602
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,774
- Oh, God!
- Ohh!

603
00:36:57,348 --> 00:37:00,579
- Harry Knowles is kicking Windows's ass.

604
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:05,245
Now, you listen to me, perv.

605
00:37:05,323 --> 00:37:09,885
Ifyou ever e-mail my niece again,
I will huntyou down like a T-1 000.

606
00:37:09,961 --> 00:37:13,294
Okay, Mr. Knowles, he didn't know- Okay.

607
00:37:13,364 --> 00:37:15,662
- You will release my friends.
- Back!

608
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:19,134
We wanted to break into the Skywalker Ranch.
Kimmy said she'd give us the floor plans.

609
00:37:19,203 --> 00:37:22,138
We were gonna break in
and steal Episode I, that's it.

610
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:25,471
That is the stupidest thing I've heard
since Schumacher put nips on Batman.

611
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:28,637
- Ohh!
- These aren't the droids you're looking for, man.

612
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:31,841
- Heh!
- Anybody else have any stupid comments?.

613
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:35,909
It's very stupid, but true. We've been
planning this since we were like six.

614
00:37:35,987 --> 00:37:37,614
Listen.
Harry, Harry, Harry.

615
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:41,021
Ifyou help us out, we'll give you all
the exclusive spoilers and all.

616
00:37:41,092 --> 00:37:43,856
- Okay?
- Ohh.

617
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:49,856
That's an interesting offer.
Episode Vwas directed bywho?.

618
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,526
- Irvin Kershner.
- That was just a warm-up.

619
00:37:51,602 --> 00:37:55,003
You. In Episode VI when Leia shoots down
two scout troopers...

620
00:37:55,072 --> 00:37:57,370
why doesn't she take one
of the speeder bikes instead of walking?.

621
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,602
If you pay attention closely,
the speeder bikes were destroyed.

622
00:37:59,677 --> 00:38:01,668
And then Luke refers to it
later on in the dialogue.

623
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:04,374
Impressive. I wasn't really
worried about you though.

624
00:38:06,250 --> 00:38:09,617
What was Luke Skywalker's call sign
during the rebel assault in Episode IV?

625
00:38:09,687 --> 00:38:11,678
Red 5.

626
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:16,489
You are all onlyas strong
as your weakest link.

627
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:19,085
Hello, weakest link.

628
00:38:19,163 --> 00:38:23,156
- What?.
- What is the name
of Chewbacca's home planet?.

629
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:27,068
- It's never discussed in the movies.
That's not fair.

630
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,799
I know. I know.

631
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:31,341
Do you give up?.

632
00:38:36,614 --> 00:38:38,878
Come on, man.
Say it.

633
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:43,318
Kashyyyk. Kashyyyk.
Chewie's home planet is Kashyyyk.

634
00:38:45,556 --> 00:38:47,854
Chewie's home planet is Kashyyyk.

635
00:38:47,925 --> 00:38:51,326
Well played, boys.
I'll help you.

636
00:38:51,395 --> 00:38:53,693
You're gonna meet my friend in Vegas.

637
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:56,699
- He's got everything you need. Okay?.
- Okay.

638
00:38:56,767 --> 00:38:59,827
- How will we know who he is?.
- Oh, don't worry. You'll know.

639
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:03,499
The password: Scruffy Nerfherder.

640
00:39:03,574 --> 00:39:06,202
- Scruffy Nerfherder.
- Good luck, boys.

641
00:39:06,277 --> 00:39:08,711
Nice detailing.

642
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,077
We're going to Vegas, fellas.

643
00:39:14,585 --> 00:39:17,383
Hey, Hutch, you mind slowing down?.

644
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:20,015
Sorry. I don't speakjagoff.

645
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:23,185
I just thought it might be nice
to get to Vegas alive.

646
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,353
- Are you kidding me?.

647
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:29,259
We got Imperial bacon.

648
00:39:31,402 --> 00:39:34,894
Okay, probably not the best time
to tell you guys this...

649
00:39:34,972 --> 00:39:37,839
but, uh, there's a giant bag of peyote
in the back of the van.

650
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:39,899
- What?.
- Excuse me?.

651
00:39:42,146 --> 00:39:44,137
The Chief gave it to me.

652
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:46,240
Hutch, just pull over
and get the ticket, man, okay?.

653
00:39:46,317 --> 00:39:49,650
We can't pull over
with a big-ass bag of peyote on us.

654
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:51,779
Pull over and stop!

655
00:39:51,856 --> 00:39:54,552
Do what he says, Hutch.
Do what he says, Hutch.

656
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:57,594
- Don't do what he says.
- Do what he says, Hutch.

657
00:39:57,661 --> 00:40:00,755
- It's gonna be okay, fellas. It's gonna be okay.
- Pull over, man.

658
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:02,628
Suck my exhaust, pork rind!

659
00:40:07,304 --> 00:40:08,965
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, Jesus!

660
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:12,440
- Talk to me, Goose.
- Talk to you?. He's back.

661
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:14,341
- He found us!
- God!

662
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,438
- Move this piece of shit!
- You don't call my van a piece of shit!

663
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:20,006
- Well?.
- Hey, ladies, ladies!

664
00:40:20,084 --> 00:40:21,847
You got to break rule number two.

665
00:40:21,919 --> 00:40:24,911
- Chewie, prepare to make
the jump to hyperspace.
- Yes!

666
00:40:24,989 --> 00:40:27,753
- Okay, I'm ready.

667
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:32,494
Somebody tell me
what the goddamn red button's for!

668
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:35,088
It's light speed, kid.

669
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:37,293
- Light speed?.
- Yeah.

670
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:39,495
- Punch it!

671
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:42,095
- What the- Come on!

672
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:45,540
- You're not gonna do this to me now.
- No. Okay, I'm resetting.

673
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:47,509
- Light speed. Impressive.

674
00:40:47,578 --> 00:40:49,546
I put a tank of nitrous in this thing.
It's not firing.

675
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,173
- Hutch, please do something.
- Hutch!

676
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:56,276
- Damn it.

677
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:01,724
- Whoo!

678
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,521
- Oh, my God!

679
00:41:04,528 --> 00:41:06,655
It's working!
Whoo!

680
00:41:08,732 --> 00:41:12,031
- Stay on target! Stay on target!
- Oh, God!

681
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:13,660
Oh, shit!

682
00:41:27,351 --> 00:41:29,911
I probably shouldn't
have called that cop a fag.

683
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:33,081
I think he took it the wrong way.

684
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,819
Breakfast.

685
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:38,418
- Oh, God.
- Ow!

686
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:40,930
-Jesus!
- Oh, God.

687
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:43,923
Ham and cheese.

688
00:41:46,537 --> 00:41:50,769
Well, look on the bright side, you guys.
This trip can't get any worse.

689
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:54,003
It just did, boys.

690
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:57,714
- What?.
- I got to drop a sewer pickle.

691
00:41:57,781 --> 00:42:01,012
- Yeah, I got to throw her into reverse.

692
00:42:01,085 --> 00:42:03,451
Bottler, give me your sandwich, bro.

693
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:06,946
Hook me up.
Another one.

694
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:09,049
- What's the sandwich for?.
- I don't know.

695
00:42:09,126 --> 00:42:12,289
I'm not gonna sit on this.

696
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,263
- Oh, Hutch!
-Jesus.

697
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:17,300
- It's crawling with criminal ass germs.

698
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:20,303
- Just hover, man.
- Okay, listen up, pre-pubes.

699
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:24,307
You got a visitor-
Sweet can of corn.

700
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:28,209
What are you doing with that ham sandwich,
boy?. It's not right what you're doing.

701
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:30,713
Hutch, you owe me a sock.

702
00:42:30,781 --> 00:42:33,773
I had to wipe with something.

703
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:37,787
You pussies owe me, big time.

704
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:41,450
- Oh, Zoe, thank God.
- We weren't sure if you'd gotten our message.

705
00:42:41,525 --> 00:42:45,985
If by message you mean Windows shrieking
into my answering machine like a little girl...

706
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,554
- then yes, message received.
- You don't know
what we've been through.

707
00:42:48,632 --> 00:42:51,328
Hutch just took a dump in front of us.

708
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:54,633
Yeah. That's life inside the big house.

709
00:42:54,705 --> 00:42:57,105
Zoe, promise me you brought the money.

710
00:42:57,174 --> 00:42:59,165
I cleared out every cent
Windows had in the comic store.

711
00:42:59,243 --> 00:43:01,837
- You what?.
- Oh! Don't even speak.

712
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:05,541
I took two taxis, an airplane
and an all-night bus ride...

713
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:08,949
next to an old man that I am
pretty sure had a full diaper.

714
00:43:09,019 --> 00:43:11,487
Hey, hey, okay.
Okay, visiting time's over.

715
00:43:11,555 --> 00:43:14,581
The judge wants to see y'all
in his private chambers.

716
00:43:14,658 --> 00:43:17,024
Oh, yeah.
Just one more thing.

717
00:43:17,094 --> 00:43:20,120
Whatever you do,
do not make fun of his name.

718
00:43:20,197 --> 00:43:23,223
Let me see ifl got this right.

719
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:25,530
Now, you tried to outrun
an officer ofthe law...

720
00:43:25,603 --> 00:43:28,436
because you obtained a bag of peyote
from a Mexican Indian chief...

721
00:43:28,505 --> 00:43:33,272
who thought it would help
treat your friend's terminal illness?

722
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:35,505
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

723
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:38,776
- I'm gonna let you boys go.

724
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:41,477
- Not because I believe you.

725
00:43:41,552 --> 00:43:44,453
- Because I believe your father.
- My father?.

726
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:47,285
- Mm-hmm.
- You actually spoke with my dad?.

727
00:43:47,358 --> 00:43:48,848
Sure did.

728
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:51,554
He wanted me to give you this message.

729
00:43:51,629 --> 00:43:53,119
Approach the bench.

730
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:06,065
Have a nice day, son.

731
00:44:07,344 --> 00:44:11,804
Yeah. Man's gone
carbonite freeze on us.

732
00:44:11,882 --> 00:44:14,817
We got to be in Vegas
in less than 24 hours.

733
00:44:14,885 --> 00:44:18,548
All right. I 'm gonna go smack
some sense into the boy.

734
00:44:18,622 --> 00:44:20,647
Whoa. Cut him some slack.

735
00:44:20,724 --> 00:44:22,521
Okay.

736
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:26,791
I just mapped out our route to Vegas
on myToughbook...

737
00:44:26,864 --> 00:44:29,731
and the closest airport's
about a hundred miles north ofhere.

738
00:44:29,800 --> 00:44:32,928
So all we got to do
is drop the ol' Zoe off...

739
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,028
and then it's a straight shot
to Sin City.

740
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:37,539
Ho! Hold on.

741
00:44:37,608 --> 00:44:39,906
You haul my ass
out into the middle of nowhere...

742
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:42,411
and expect me to just jump
on the first plane back?.

743
00:44:42,479 --> 00:44:44,379
Sorry. It's not gonna happen.

744
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:46,507
Come on. You know this trip is men only.

745
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:48,210
I tell you what.

746
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:52,745
I'll get on the plane
if any one of you can take me down.

747
00:44:52,823 --> 00:44:55,155
Listen, Princess.

748
00:44:55,225 --> 00:44:58,058
No one wants to see you get hurt.

749
00:44:58,128 --> 00:45:00,119
I'm gonna get Botts.

750
00:45:04,101 --> 00:45:06,968
- Get off of me!
- Oh, my God!

751
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,164
- Be a man, Hutch.
- Get her off of me!

752
00:45:09,239 --> 00:45:11,298
- Hutch, say ""time-out"'
- Don't just stand there!

753
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,400
Shoot her!
Somebody shoot her!

754
00:45:13,477 --> 00:45:16,776
- Help me, for God sake! God help me!
- Gentlemen.

755
00:45:16,847 --> 00:45:19,077
- Get the jaws of life!
- I'm good.

756
00:45:19,149 --> 00:45:22,243
- Welcome aboard.

757
00:45:24,321 --> 00:45:27,085
- Now go get Eric.
- Yes, sir!

758
00:45:27,157 --> 00:45:29,523
- And be nice.

759
00:45:31,261 --> 00:45:34,094
You're lucky I have a crush on you.

760
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,134
Yo, Botts, you okay?.

761
00:45:40,971 --> 00:45:44,168
You know, I could do this-
start a life here.

762
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:47,210
Clean slate.
Fresh air.

763
00:45:47,277 --> 00:45:50,269
No pressure, no responsibility.

764
00:45:50,347 --> 00:45:53,111
Yeah, it seems nice, man.

765
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:56,812
In theory it sounds nice.

766
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:04,390
I bet there's not even like a BlockbusterVideo
within 500 miles ofhere.

767
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:06,452
Or like a Falafel Hut or-

768
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:09,294
Guys, shut up.

769
00:46:10,567 --> 00:46:13,695
I just figured ifl...

770
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:17,070
worked hard and...

771
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:19,871
sold enough cars and impressed my dad
enough times, I'd-

772
00:46:21,378 --> 00:46:24,814
I'd feel something.

773
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:28,511
You gotta find your Death Star.

774
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:32,321
Okay, I'll bite.

775
00:46:32,389 --> 00:46:35,881
Greatest deed Luke Skywalker ever did...

776
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:38,223
was take down the Death Star, right?.

777
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:41,731
As faras I'm concerned,
that's what everybodyneeds.

778
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:45,633
You need that one bad-ass thing...

779
00:46:47,704 --> 00:46:50,468
that lets you live on forever, you know.

780
00:46:52,643 --> 00:46:54,577
Yeah.

781
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:02,516
Hey, Spice Girls!

782
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:05,453
Are you gonna swap recipes all day?.

783
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:07,854
Vegas awaits, ladies.

784
00:47:10,394 --> 00:47:12,487
- Wow!
- Sweet!

785
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:21,028
And here's where you learn
how to do Vegas, fanboy style.

786
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:25,570
- You guys thinking
what I'm thinking?

787
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:29,043
They are everywhere, Giles.

788
00:47:31,081 --> 00:47:33,515
Mama, star people.

789
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:38,382
This is so gay.

790
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:40,946
Ow!

791
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:43,185
Let me get that for you.

792
00:47:44,828 --> 00:47:48,696
You, uh-You might wanna hit the showers.

793
00:47:48,765 --> 00:47:51,632
'Cause you smell like something
shit in my nose.

794
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:54,193
- Yes, Your Highnessness.
- Ew!

795
00:47:54,271 --> 00:47:58,230
What in God's name is living on your chest?.
It looks like you fell on ALF.

796
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:03,274
- God!
- Look who's back in uniform.

797
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:07,283
- Nice.
- Yeah, it's almost 8:00, so we
gotta go meet Harry's contact.

798
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:09,512
Then let's go.

799
00:48:09,586 --> 00:48:11,816
- You guys coming?
- I'll catch up with you guys later.

800
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:15,325
I'm just gonna do a bit
of pillagin' the tables first.

801
00:48:17,461 --> 00:48:19,395
- Twenty-two. Loser.
- Ah,Jesus!

802
00:48:19,463 --> 00:48:22,227
That is mathematically impossible.

803
00:48:22,299 --> 00:48:24,426
I must have the worst luck
in the northern hemisphere.

804
00:48:24,501 --> 00:48:26,492
I heard about the Rogue Leader debacle.

805
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,629
- That's one for the record books.
- Hey.

806
00:48:28,705 --> 00:48:33,074
A cross between Sarah Michelle Gellar
and Janeane Garofalo, it's too good to be true.

807
00:48:33,143 --> 00:48:36,271
I just have to face the facts, Zoe.
I'm 24 years old...

808
00:48:36,346 --> 00:48:38,974
and I've only ever copulated
with one woman.

809
00:48:39,049 --> 00:48:41,313
Plenty of guys have
only been with one woman.

810
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:44,445
I don't know that manywomen
to have only been with one woman.

811
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:48,514
I, uh-
I'm female kryptonite.

812
00:48:49,559 --> 00:48:51,823
Look, you're fine around me.

813
00:48:51,895 --> 00:48:55,956
Well, yeah, of course I am.
That's 'cause...

814
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:58,365
you are not a girl.

815
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,869
You know what I mean?

816
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,929
No. Please enlighten me.

817
00:49:03,006 --> 00:49:06,271
You know every Bond villain,
you constantly quote Clash of the Titans...

818
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:09,141
and you've beat every Zelda game
Nintendo's ever released.

819
00:49:09,212 --> 00:49:13,148
- I mean-
- Dude, dude, dude. Three o'clock, man.

820
00:49:13,216 --> 00:49:16,447
Hotties on the slotties.

821
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:36,600
I would knock the nickels
out of that pussy!

822
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:40,040
Dude, you're gonna be my Dak today,
all right?. Follow my lead.

823
00:49:40,110 --> 00:49:45,207
-Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa.
You wanna just talk to them?.
-Yeah. It's called having balls.

824
00:49:45,282 --> 00:49:48,718
Or in your case, one ball.
Come on. Eric and Linus are waiting.

825
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:51,618
What are you, the wife?.
Let's go.

826
00:49:51,688 --> 00:49:54,816
- Wait. You're going over there?.
- Uh-

827
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:57,883
Turns out you're more
clueless than you think.

828
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:00,486
- Apparently, so am I.
- What does that mean?. Zoe!

829
00:50:00,564 --> 00:50:03,431
- Zoe!
- Come on.

830
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,162
- Pardon me.
- Hi there.

831
00:50:06,236 --> 00:50:08,329
- Hello. How are you?.
- Hi.

832
00:50:08,405 --> 00:50:11,897
- Hi.
- Ladies.

833
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:15,843
- You ladies looking for love in Alderaan places?

834
00:50:15,912 --> 00:50:20,042
- Excuse me?.
- Alderaan is the last planet
destroyed by the Death Star-

835
00:50:20,117 --> 00:50:22,950
Bomba, bomba, bomba!
Dat-dat-dat-dat-dat-dat! Daniel-san.

836
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:26,786
What my socially retarded friend
was trying to say...

837
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,758
was that we'd like to
maybe buy you two gals a beverage.

838
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:32,021
- Sure.
- Sure.

839
00:50:32,095 --> 00:50:35,030
- Oh, my God. Wow.

840
00:50:35,098 --> 00:50:38,226
You know, uh, Eric and Linus
are waiting for us.

841
00:50:38,301 --> 00:50:41,464
I think that they're going to understand.

842
00:50:41,538 --> 00:50:44,666
They're going to understand.

843
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:48,074
Where are they, man?.
It's almost- It's almost 8:00!

844
00:50:48,145 --> 00:50:51,581
I don't know where they are, but we
don't have time to wait for 'em. Come on.

845
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:53,912
Convention room's this way.
Let's go.

846
00:51:00,624 --> 00:51:02,683
- Rak non!
- Yes, sir!

847
00:51:02,759 --> 00:51:04,989
Phasers on stun.

848
00:51:05,062 --> 00:51:08,122
Being the C.E.O.
of my own company...

849
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:10,166
I'm not gonna lie to you,
I get a lot of perks.

850
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:12,531
I got a big-ass mansion, you know.

851
00:51:12,602 --> 00:51:15,264
I got a butler-
Maurice.

852
00:51:15,338 --> 00:51:20,207
Bentley in the drive.
Flux capacitor.

853
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:24,441
I mean, the 1.21 gigawatts,
that don't come cheap, you know.

854
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:27,483
- But I got the duckets, you know.
- Wow.

855
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:30,418
There's nothing more sexy
than a man with power.

856
00:51:30,487 --> 00:51:32,819
What do you mean?.
Like-You like power?.

857
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:34,823
- Uh-huh.
- I like power.

858
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:36,916
- I got a hell of a lot of power.
- Yeah?.

859
00:51:36,993 --> 00:51:38,984
Yeah.

860
00:51:44,201 --> 00:51:46,669
You want to come sit on my lap.

861
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:51,666
Oh. Wow.

862
00:51:53,343 --> 00:51:56,779
You want to take your shirt off.

863
00:51:59,916 --> 00:52:01,781
Wow-ar-r-rm.

864
00:52:02,886 --> 00:52:04,877
Yummy!

865
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:22,701
Oh, my God.

866
00:52:22,772 --> 00:52:24,501
- Canyou smell that?
- Trekkies.

867
00:52:24,574 --> 00:52:28,237
Yeah.

868
00:52:30,213 --> 00:52:34,149
Badges.

869
00:52:34,217 --> 00:52:37,550
Yeah, we're not here for the Trek.

870
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:40,181
Okay?. We're here to see somebody.

871
00:52:40,257 --> 00:52:43,693
And who would that be?.

872
00:52:45,362 --> 00:52:47,523
We're here to see the nerfherder.

873
00:52:48,765 --> 00:52:52,861
- Hmm?.
- Scruffy Nerfherder.

874
00:52:54,938 --> 00:52:56,963
Ow! Ow! Ow! Stop!

875
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,565
And then Zoe just storms off.

876
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:01,668
I mean, she's really...

877
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:05,545
a very difficult specimen
to read sometimes.

878
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:08,106
Ifyou know what I mean.
But I-

879
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:11,279
You just can't act like that
if you wanna be one of the guys.

880
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:16,548
Maybe... she doesn't
wanna be one ofthe guys.

881
00:53:18,295 --> 00:53:20,195
She likes you.

882
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:25,997
But I didn't-
But she kind ofjust-

883
00:53:27,971 --> 00:53:30,201
-Jesus Murphy!

884
00:53:30,273 --> 00:53:32,571
Wow. Okay.

885
00:53:32,642 --> 00:53:34,803
What-What should I do?.

886
00:53:34,878 --> 00:53:38,712
Well, ifthere's one thing
I learned being an escort...

887
00:53:38,782 --> 00:53:41,910
it's that actions speak louder than words.

888
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:43,976
Did you just say "escort"?.

889
00:53:49,593 --> 00:53:51,857
Fantastic.

890
00:53:51,928 --> 00:53:54,590
- Shh!

891
00:53:55,899 --> 00:53:58,265
- I don't thinkwe're alone.
- Yeah.

892
00:53:58,335 --> 00:54:00,895
You're late!

893
00:54:04,808 --> 00:54:07,299
It's all there-
maps, pass codes...

894
00:54:07,377 --> 00:54:12,246
phony I.D's to get you past the front gates,
but that's not what's most important.

895
00:54:12,315 --> 00:54:14,340
What's most important?.

896
00:54:18,855 --> 00:54:21,653
- We never met.

897
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:23,659
- That's Capt-
- Yeah. I think-

898
00:54:25,362 --> 00:54:29,025
I should- Hi.
I can't believe that these are classified.

899
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:32,296
And there's-
Look at the maps. I mean, there's badges.

900
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:35,463
And there's Trekkin' with TJ.
What is this for?.

901
00:54:35,538 --> 00:54:37,836
Just something forthe ride.

902
00:54:37,907 --> 00:54:41,809
- Thank you.
- This is unreal. How did you score all this stuff?.

903
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:47,111
Are you kidding?.
I'm William Shatner. I can score anything.

904
00:54:47,183 --> 00:54:50,050
- Okay.
- How 'bout- How 'bout Jeri Ryan's panties?.

905
00:54:50,120 --> 00:54:52,850
- Oh.
- Anything.

906
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:55,288
- I'm so glad that we met.
- Me too.

907
00:54:55,358 --> 00:54:59,055
This is-Whoa. Hey.
Wait, wait.

908
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:01,188
Okay, let me go.

909
00:55:01,264 --> 00:55:04,631
- Hutch, private convo. Jesus.
- What the hell are you-

910
00:55:04,701 --> 00:55:06,726
What are you doing, man?
Get the hell out of here.

911
00:55:06,803 --> 00:55:08,896
It's not a good time.
The Force is strong with me here.

912
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:12,408
- Actually, your hour's over.
- What do you mean, "over"?.

913
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:16,411
- Hutch, they're hookers.
- We're not hookers. We're escorts.

914
00:55:16,479 --> 00:55:18,470
- The difference being?.
- I don't know.

915
00:55:18,548 --> 00:55:21,244
Excuse me. Sorry.
You telling me...

916
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:26,346
that Ijust spent the last hoursweet talking
a smoking, hot whore?

917
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:29,051
- You could always pay for another hour.
- How much?.

918
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:31,559
- One thousand.
- Dollars?.

919
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:34,096
- Mm-hmm.
- Each! I want a refund.

920
00:55:34,164 --> 00:55:35,893
- Give me a refund.
- Is that possible?.

921
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:39,059
You know what? We're male
prostitutes and you owe us a thousand dollars!

922
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:41,660
- You can talk it over with Roach.
- Roach?.

923
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:49,438
- Hi, Daddy.
- Greetings and salutations. It is payday.

924
00:55:49,512 --> 00:55:52,743
- Ten-thousand shares of Priceline?.
- Anything.

925
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:57,947
-Wow.
-Next time you see Harry
Knowles, tell him we're square.

926
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,046
Friends ofyours?.

927
00:56:02,459 --> 00:56:05,451
Cry havoc!

928
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:14,230
Zinfandel.
That's a good vintage.

929
00:56:14,304 --> 00:56:17,569
Uh, this has all been
a reallybig misunderstanding.

930
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:22,373
You see, my friend and I, we didn't know
that we were on the clock, per se.

931
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:24,470
You thought you were
getting that for free, did ya?.

932
00:56:24,547 --> 00:56:27,710
- Uh, Mr. Roach?
- Yeah?.

933
00:56:27,784 --> 00:56:30,617
Would you mind not eating
those peanuts 'cause-

934
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:34,987
Buddy, these are like
$10 a peanut, you know.

935
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:36,992
- Oh, yeah?.
- Yeah.

936
00:56:37,060 --> 00:56:40,894
Well, why don't you take it
out of the $2,000...

937
00:56:40,964 --> 00:56:44,297
that you and your skinny
little idiot friend owe me, how's that sound?.

938
00:56:44,367 --> 00:56:47,302

- You're Star Wars fans?.
- Yeah.

942
00:56:54,010 --> 00:56:56,638
Shit. Why didn't you say so, man?.

You think that's cool,

"Do or do not"' That's funny.

947
00:57:07,657 --> 00:57:11,149
Don't join the Dark Side

958
00:57:41,057 --> 00:57:43,890
Thank you so much for listening.

959
00:57:46,463 --> 00:57:49,296
- Go, go, go!
- Balloons?.
You thought that was gonna stop 'em?.

960
00:57:51,367 --> 00:57:52,959
- Grab the princess.
- Come on, Zoe!

961
00:57:53,036 --> 00:57:57,097
- Get off me. I'm not speaking toyou.
- Seriously. We gotta go now!

962
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:05,237
- Why are we running?. What did you do?.

963
00:58:06,983 --> 00:58:08,974
They're everywhere!
They're everywhere!

964
00:58:09,052 --> 00:58:11,020
- You're going the wrong way!

965
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:16,722
- Yeah!

966
00:58:17,927 --> 00:58:22,387
That's him!
He's the one who destroyed Khan.

967
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:24,660
You called Han Solo a bitch, man!

968
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:28,033
Han Solo is a bitch.

969
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:31,164
No one calls...

970
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:35,575
Han Solo a bitch!

971
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:47,388
- Go, go, go!
- Go, go, go!

972
00:58:47,457 --> 00:58:50,358
Why are we running?

973
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:55,687
- Go! Come on!
- What is going on?.

974
00:59:00,837 --> 00:59:04,102
You stop this van, you little sons of bitches!
I'm gonna kill you!

975
00:59:04,173 --> 00:59:06,573
This is not copacetic.
You stop!

976
00:59:10,980 --> 00:59:12,811
Zoe, hit him with the pressed ham!

977
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:15,544
Yeah!

978
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:21,453
- Yeah!
- Nice.

979
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:25,588
Nailed it.

980
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:30,766
Linus? Jesus!

981
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:32,664
- Where'd he go?.
- Did he fall out?.

982
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,397
Chewie.
I call Chewie.

983
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:39,498
Dr. Richardson
to Trauma 2. Dr. Richardson, Trauma 2.

984
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:41,510
Your friend's awake.

985
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:44,172
- Uh, cool. Can we see him?.
- Yes.

986
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,374
But first we need to have a little talk.

987
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:49,145
Linus tells me that
you're on some sort of a road trip.

988
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:53,120
- Uh, yeah, up to San Francisco.
- Well, not anymore, fellas.

989
00:59:53,189 --> 00:59:55,749
The only place he's going is back to Ohio.

990
00:59:55,825 --> 01:00:00,194
- We can't do that.
-Just what's so important in San Francisco?.

991
01:00:02,198 --> 01:00:04,530
- Uh, he-
- Star Wars.

992
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:07,126
Star Wars?

993
01:00:07,203 --> 01:00:11,867
Look, he is very, verysick
and he needs to go home.

994
01:00:14,844 --> 01:00:16,812
No.

995
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:22,010
Guys, we can't- we can't do this now.
We can't give up now.

996
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:24,781
Not when we're so close.

997
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:31,117
Linus, it'sjust a movie.

998
01:00:36,532 --> 01:00:39,797
Yeah, maybe it is.
Maybe it is. You know what?.

999
01:00:39,869 --> 01:00:42,531
To most people, Star Wars
is just a movie, right?.

1000
01:00:42,605 --> 01:00:44,903
- Not to us!
- We just spoke to the doctor.

1001
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:48,137
Screw that doctor!
Screw- Screw all those people!

1002
01:00:48,211 --> 01:00:52,614
Did-Did they ever get their- their heads stuck
in a bucket trying to be Darth Vader?.

1003
01:00:52,682 --> 01:00:54,912
- I mean, I don't think so. No.
- Nope.

1004
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:58,420
Did they ever singe their eyebrows
trying to make a lightsaber?

1005
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:02,151
No way. Did they name
their right hand Leia?.

1006
01:01:02,225 --> 01:01:04,659
Who knows?
Yes, they could have.

1007
01:01:04,727 --> 01:01:06,695
- But you know who did?.
- Me.

1008
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:09,095
Yes, you did.
So did I. So did you.

1009
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:12,032
- We all did.
- You guys are freaking sick. You know that?.

1010
01:01:12,101 --> 01:01:14,160
This is our Death Star, man.

1011
01:01:17,373 --> 01:01:21,571
And I don't know about you, guys,
but I'm not running away from this one.

1012
01:01:21,644 --> 01:01:25,375
- Me neither.
- Screw it. I named both my hands Leia.

1013
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:31,176
What the hell areyou doing?.
Do you know who this is?.

1014
01:01:31,254 --> 01:01:33,688
It's that way.

1015
01:01:33,756 --> 01:01:36,224
Jailbreak!
Jailbreak!

1016
01:01:36,292 --> 01:01:38,590
- What's going on?.

1017
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:46,631
- Hold it right there!
- No, uh, please-

1018
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,796
You're our only hope.

1019
01:01:52,975 --> 01:01:56,240
Take two ofthese every three hours.

1020
01:01:59,682 --> 01:02:01,980
Oh, my God.

1021
01:02:04,687 --> 01:02:06,917
- I love you.
- I know.

1022
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:09,082
- Yeah!

1023
01:02:22,171 --> 01:02:24,298
- Mmm.

1024
01:02:24,373 --> 01:02:27,831
Nothing worse than a locked shitter
when you got to turd, am I right?.

1025
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,434
Seriously, man.

1026
01:02:32,715 --> 01:02:36,082
That is it, man!
I don't wanna do this anymore!

1027
01:02:36,152 --> 01:02:39,644
Why not?. What'd I tell you,
sweet and womanly, right?.

1028
01:02:39,722 --> 01:02:41,622
- Womanly?.

1029
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:44,251
- Make sure you go tell your friends.
- I'll be back.

1030
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:54,067
Bam, bam, bam!
Hyah! Wanna try that?.

1031
01:02:56,506 --> 01:03:00,033
Start the car! Start the van!

1032
01:03:03,613 --> 01:03:06,776
- Hi!

1033
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:08,874
- Let's do it! Let's do it!
- Oh, my God!

1034
01:03:08,951 --> 01:03:13,320
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

1035
01:03:13,389 --> 01:03:16,722
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1036
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,727
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!

1037
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:22,060
Shut up, man! It was a hundred
miles ago! Stop living in the past!

1038
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:24,065
Oh, my God!

1039
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:27,660
Lucas Valley Road.
We gotta steal that sign, guys.

1040
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:38,512
- Zoe, how we looking out there?

1041
01:03:38,581 --> 01:03:43,143
One guard manni ng the booth.
Couple civvies roaming about.

1042
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:46,620
- Nothing we can't handle.
- All right, fellas, "X" marks our target.

1043
01:03:46,689 --> 01:03:50,318
Level "C" editing bays. It's our best chance
for finding the rough cut.

1044
01:03:50,393 --> 01:03:53,521
Excellent. Okay.
Once we've breached the front gate...

1045
01:03:53,596 --> 01:03:58,499
we're gonna be off on foot, so we're gonna
have to take a shortcut at this wall here.

1046
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:00,695
And you know what that means.

1047
01:04:00,770 --> 01:04:02,897
Are you shitting-
Grappling hook?.

1048
01:04:02,972 --> 01:04:05,964
"Tom Sawyer"

1049
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:11,006
A modern-day warrior
Mean, mean stride

1050
01:04:11,080 --> 01:04:14,243
Today's Tom Sawyer
Mean, mean pride

1051
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:24,822
I can do this.

1052
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:27,761
- Get up.
- Windows, how's it look up there?

1053
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:30,924
Windows, make sure there are no cameras.

1054
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,594
- Can you see anything?

1055
01:04:33,669 --> 01:04:36,695
- Al I right, one, two-

1056
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:40,868
- Oh, Jesus!
- Windows,Jesus!

1057
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:44,035
- Ow!

1058
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:46,911
- Okay.
- Wait. There he is. Good man. Good man.

1059
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:49,679
Let's go.
Follow my lead. Follow my lead.

1060
01:04:49,752 --> 01:04:53,552
Get down. Stay low. The ninja roll.

1061
01:04:53,623 --> 01:04:56,251
Guys, get down!

1062
01:04:56,325 --> 01:05:00,785
- Jackass.
- Guys, wait for me.

1063
01:05:00,863 --> 01:05:03,388
I hate running.

1064
01:05:03,466 --> 01:05:07,630
This is like the most exercise
you guys have gotten all year.

1065
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:13,468
This is the one Shatner
said would be open.

1066
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:19,144
A breach in Skywalker security.

1067
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:22,776
- Wow. Okay, we're in.

1068
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:27,380
I feel like we're in a Scooby-Doo episode.

1069
01:05:27,456 --> 01:05:31,153
- Go, go, go, go.

1070
01:05:31,227 --> 01:05:33,195
- Hutch?.
- Yeah?.

1071
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:36,663
- Your ass still smells like ham and cheese.

1072
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:43,504
Sweet. That way.

1073
01:05:48,344 --> 01:05:50,335
Wow.

1074
01:06:00,189 --> 01:06:03,784
Shatner, don't fail us now, right?.

1075
01:06:05,394 --> 01:06:07,828
- Whoa.

1076
01:06:07,897 --> 01:06:09,797
Yeah!

1077
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:21,475
- Oh, my God.
- No way.

1078
01:06:24,814 --> 01:06:27,248
We're home, boys.

1079
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:29,250
See, that's what I call a collection.

1080
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:32,116
This is where I want my ashes scattered.

1081
01:06:41,263 --> 01:06:44,323
Oh!

1082
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:49,896
- "Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.
You're my only hope"'

1083
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:53,408
They've got Indy stuff.

1084
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:55,706
Thermal detonator.

1085
01:06:55,778 --> 01:06:58,008
I think I'm gonna cry.

1086
01:06:58,080 --> 01:07:03,245
Hey. They got Willow's spell book!

1087
01:07:03,319 --> 01:07:05,617
You know, Willow?.
Little guy?.

1088
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:09,556
Magical-
"Kaiya."

1089
01:07:09,625 --> 01:07:11,252
Who cares about Willow?.

1090
01:07:11,327 --> 01:07:15,457
Look at this.

1091
01:07:15,531 --> 01:07:18,432
"Throw me the idol. "

1092
01:07:19,502 --> 01:07:22,471
Guys, look at this.
"We've got bad dates."

1093
01:07:22,538 --> 01:07:27,271
One kaddam for the Hebrew god.

1094
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:30,278
We have a breach in the archive room.
Breach in the archive room.

1095
01:07:40,923 --> 01:07:43,949
You know, no matter
how you felt about the guy...

1096
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:48,196
Vader embraced his fate.

1097
01:07:48,264 --> 01:07:50,494
He faced death head-on.

1098
01:07:53,669 --> 01:07:57,161
No one moves.

1099
01:07:57,239 --> 01:08:00,902
Subjects have been located.
Requesting backup.

1100
01:08:00,976 --> 01:08:03,638
Please step away from Lord Vader.

1101
01:08:03,712 --> 01:08:06,237
Dude, what's up with the outfits?.

1102
01:08:06,315 --> 01:08:08,681
Company policy.

1103
01:08:08,751 --> 01:08:11,151
You wanna work here,
you gotta wear the suit.

1104
01:08:11,220 --> 01:08:14,678
Carl, you make us wear the suit.

1105
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:18,193
- Run?.
- Run.
- Run.

1106
01:08:19,261 --> 01:08:21,354
- Zoe!
-Just go!

1107
01:08:21,430 --> 01:08:24,593
- I'm not leaving without her.
- What, areyou crazy? It's three against one!

1108
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:26,965
Never tell me the odds.

1109
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:30,699
- There can be only one.

1110
01:08:34,577 --> 01:08:37,478
Time for you to get mauled, boy.

1111
01:08:44,420 --> 01:08:47,446
- I'm good.

1112
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:50,048
- Go!
- Let's go!

1113
01:08:50,126 --> 01:08:51,855
Man down! Man down!

1114
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:00,535
- Stop! Don't move!

1115
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:02,537
Run!

1116
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:05,438
Subjects are fleeing to the west corridor!

1117
01:09:05,508 --> 01:09:08,306
- Go, go, go!
- Stop!

1118
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:10,140
Go, go!

1119
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:13,477
Come on!

1120
01:09:16,485 --> 01:09:21,320
Hmm. Yoda says going up you are.

1121
01:09:29,298 --> 01:09:33,701
- In!
- Get in! Get your ass in there!

1122
01:09:33,769 --> 01:09:36,863
- Hurry!
- Let's go!

1123
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:39,100
- Move it! Over there!

1124
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:42,736
- Over there! Let's go!

1125
01:09:45,347 --> 01:09:47,338
That was awesome!

1126
01:09:48,517 --> 01:09:51,315
Where the hell are we?

1127
01:09:51,387 --> 01:09:53,582
I have a bad feeling about this.

1128
01:09:53,656 --> 01:09:56,784
Um, you guys don't think that the, um-

1129
01:09:56,859 --> 01:09:58,884
We are in George Lucas's trash room.

1130
01:09:58,961 --> 01:10:02,761
Don't be ridiculous, okay?.
The walls are not gonna close in on us.

1131
01:10:05,601 --> 01:10:09,697
- Holy-
- Jesus!

1132
01:10:12,107 --> 01:10:14,200
- Let's fortify the walls with this.
- Do it!

1133
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:17,109
- Um, girls?.
- Goddamn you, walls!

1134
01:10:17,179 --> 01:10:18,942
Girls!

1135
01:10:19,014 --> 01:10:21,312
That'd be the air duct.

1136
01:10:22,618 --> 01:10:25,314
- And that there's the exit.
- Yeah, the exit.

1137
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:28,322
- And you guys are the big pussies.
- I knew.

1138
01:10:28,390 --> 01:10:31,450
"3PO!
We're all right!"

1139
01:10:35,097 --> 01:10:39,090
- Guys, this way!

1140
01:10:39,168 --> 01:10:42,228
- Yikes!
- Check in here.

1141
01:10:42,304 --> 01:10:44,295
This one's clear.

1142
01:10:53,215 --> 01:10:56,150
- Damn it, shut up!

1143
01:10:59,121 --> 01:11:01,487
I thinkwe lost 'em, right?.

1144
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:09,056
Yeah, we lost them for now, but we
cannot run around this place all night.

1145
01:11:12,334 --> 01:11:14,359
Guys!

1146
01:11:15,871 --> 01:11:17,668
We're in the motherboard.
We're in.

1147
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:21,198
- George Lucas's office.
- George Lucas's office!

1148
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:24,713
Holyshit. Oh, wow.
We're- We're-

1149
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:27,078
- Oh, my God.
- We're in the motherboard.

1150
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:30,016
You guys need to see this.
You guys need to see this. Look.

1151
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:35,117
- Holy Hoth!

1152
01:11:35,190 --> 01:11:38,648
- I think this is it. I think this is it.
- Oh, my God.

1153
01:11:38,727 --> 01:11:41,321
Play it. Play it.

1154
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:44,628
Hey, get over here.
Come on.

1155
01:11:48,404 --> 01:11:50,702
- The crawl!

1156
01:11:50,773 --> 01:11:53,401
The crawl!

1157
01:11:53,475 --> 01:11:56,876
- Oh, my God.

1158
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:03,713
Come on! Come on!

1159
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:11,689
- Here you are.
- Yeah.

1160
01:12:14,630 --> 01:12:17,565
That hooker in Vegas gave me something.

1161
01:12:17,633 --> 01:12:19,567
What?.

1162
01:12:19,635 --> 01:12:21,830
The truth.

1163
01:12:21,904 --> 01:12:25,305
I'm in love with you and, uh-

1164
01:12:25,374 --> 01:12:27,604
I love you too.

1165
01:12:27,676 --> 01:12:30,577
- Stand back.

1166
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:43,623
- Okay, on your feet!
- Us?.

1167
01:12:43,692 --> 01:12:47,560
- Yeah! Come on up! On your feet!
- Get on outta here! Come on!

1168
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:49,859
Now! Get on your feet!

1169
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:52,127
Yeah, get on your feet!
Who the hell are these people?.

1170
01:12:52,201 --> 01:12:54,635
- And line up against the wall, all of you!
- Back against the wall!

1171
01:12:54,703 --> 01:12:58,070
Get up! What are you talkin' about?. Hey!

1172
01:12:58,140 --> 01:13:01,735
Step awayfrom the Millennium Falcon
and line up against the wall.

1173
01:13:03,178 --> 01:13:05,442
- Now!
- Oh.

1174
01:13:05,514 --> 01:13:07,982
- Oh, God.
- Linus, what are you doing, man?.

1175
01:13:08,050 --> 01:13:10,746
I'm feeling crazy right now.

1176
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:13,788
- Dude, do you have any idea
how valuable that thing is?.
- Not a good idea.

1177
01:13:13,856 --> 01:13:16,290
Put it down. Come on.
Put it down now!

1178
01:13:16,358 --> 01:13:20,886
You guys stand up against the wall,
or I will smash this thing into a billion pieces!

1179
01:13:21,830 --> 01:13:24,822
I will.
I will smash this!

1180
01:13:24,900 --> 01:13:27,630
- No.
- What, you think I won't?.

1181
01:13:27,703 --> 01:13:30,399
- No, I don't.
- No, you don't, you think that I won't...

1182
01:13:30,472 --> 01:13:32,440
or, no, you don't, you think that I will?.

1183
01:13:32,508 --> 01:13:35,841
- The first one.
- I'm confused. Who's doing what now?.

1184
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:37,936
- You tell me.
- It doesn't matter.

1185
01:13:38,013 --> 01:13:41,449
Because ifhe puts down the Millennium
Falcon, I will smash this training remote...

1186
01:13:41,517 --> 01:13:43,007
erasing it from history.

1187
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:45,645
- Come on, guys. Let's rethink this.
- Shut up, Windows!

1188
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:48,485
-Who's doing what?.
-Put down the Millennium Falcon
and the training remote...

1189
01:13:48,557 --> 01:13:50,491
or l will destroy this puppet.

1190
01:13:50,559 --> 01:13:53,153
- Craig! You can't!
- Shut up, Barry.

1191
01:13:53,228 --> 01:13:55,753
- Put down Master Yoda!
- You put yours down, damn it!

1192
01:13:55,831 --> 01:13:59,358
- I can't do it!

1193
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:01,596
- All right, everybody shut up!
- Oh!

1194
01:14:01,670 --> 01:14:05,470
Swear to God, this little ewok
is going up in flames! I'll do it.

1195
01:14:05,541 --> 01:14:08,203
- Do it. Go ahead. Burn it.
- I will.

1196
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:10,142
- Yeah, burn it.
- Guys, nobodywants this.

1197
01:14:10,212 --> 01:14:12,271
- I will.
- Burn it. Burn it.

1198
01:14:12,347 --> 01:14:14,713
- I'm gonna. That's what I said!
- Burn it!

1199
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:17,775
Good. I was always more of
a Star Trek fan anyway.

1200
01:14:17,853 --> 01:14:21,016
Damn Trekkies are everywhere!

1201
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:26,858
All right, we'll take it from here.
Sir, give me the Falcon.

1202
01:14:29,131 --> 01:14:31,964
- I can't believe I let you guys get me into this.
- Shut up!

1203
01:14:37,105 --> 01:14:39,972
How you guys doing?.
You guys doing good?.

1204
01:14:41,944 --> 01:14:43,878
So let me get this right.

1205
01:14:43,946 --> 01:14:47,973
You guys wanted to see
our movie early for free.

1206
01:14:48,050 --> 01:14:51,213
So you broke into private property, huh?.

1207
01:14:51,286 --> 01:14:53,413
- And you tried to steal it.
- I-I-

1208
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,514
I haven't even seen the movie yet!

1209
01:14:55,591 --> 01:14:57,491
Sir, I understand that this looks bad-

1210
01:14:57,559 --> 01:15:00,995
It looks like three-to-five-years, locked-up,
for-breaking-and-entering bad.

1211
01:15:01,063 --> 01:15:04,032
That's right, sweet cheeks.
By the time y'all walk away from this...

1212
01:15:04,099 --> 01:15:06,727
your faces are gonna be
shrunken and shriveled...

1213
01:15:06,802 --> 01:15:09,202
just like your one nut.

1214
01:15:09,271 --> 01:15:13,173
What?. How can he possibly know that?.

1215
01:15:13,242 --> 01:15:15,176
Oh, we know about your uniball.

1216
01:15:15,244 --> 01:15:20,045
We know everything,
Mr. Harold Hutchinson, a.k.a. Hutch.

1217
01:15:20,115 --> 01:15:23,915
Son ofGloria.
Humongous Rush fan.

1218
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:26,181
Dude, you're freaking me out.
How do you know this?.

1219
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:28,280
Because you have a Rush shirt on, dipshit.

1220
01:15:28,357 --> 01:15:33,522
And because we have
a dossier on every single one ofyou.

1221
01:15:33,595 --> 01:15:35,358
- No one move!

1222
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:38,695
Getyour hands offthe glass table.

1223
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:41,531
- Hello, Mr. Lucas.

1224
01:15:41,603 --> 01:15:43,628
Shut up!
Shut your mouths.

1225
01:15:43,705 --> 01:15:46,765
- Yes.
- I can hear his beard.

1226
01:15:46,842 --> 01:15:50,403
Yes. Shut up. Mm-hmm.

1227
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:54,210
I don't wanna say that it was a hole in my
security, but- How did you guys break in?.

1228
01:15:54,283 --> 01:15:56,376
- I used a grappling hook-
- And we climbed-

1229
01:15:56,451 --> 01:15:59,249
- Was William Shatner involved with this?.
- No. Not at all.

1230
01:15:59,321 --> 01:16:03,087
Theysaidno.
No. No one was hurt. Notyet.

1231
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:05,217
Mm-hmm.

1232
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:07,489
Okay. Very well.

1233
01:16:11,033 --> 01:16:16,096
Damn it. I've just been told
that what I said earlier I no longer believe.

1234
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:18,071
Hmm?.

1235
01:16:21,043 --> 01:16:24,376
Mr. Lucas is touched and mildly flattered
by what you have done here.

1236
01:16:24,446 --> 01:16:27,244
And I have been informed
that I feel the same way.

1237
01:16:27,316 --> 01:16:31,514
- So the charges are gonna be dropped.

1238
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:34,681
That is, of course, if you are...

1239
01:16:34,756 --> 01:16:37,281
what you appear to be.

1240
01:16:37,359 --> 01:16:39,589
Uh, what do we appear to be?.

1241
01:16:39,661 --> 01:16:44,564
Fanboys. Something we can easily
determine with a simple quiz.

1242
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:53,297
What is the name ofthe planet
that Leia gave Grand MoffTarkin...

1243
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:55,775
as the false location ofthe rebel base
in Episode IV?

1244
01:16:55,844 --> 01:16:59,336
- Dantooine.
- What is the name ofthe gunner
in Luke's snow speeder?.

1245
01:16:59,414 --> 01:17:03,043
- Dak.
- Where is a woman's g-spot located?.

1246
01:17:05,220 --> 01:17:08,519
- What?.
- If you were to ask a woman to
perform a Mississippi handbag...

1247
01:17:08,590 --> 01:17:11,218
where would your testicles end up?.

1248
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:14,057
That's not a Star Wars question.

1249
01:17:14,129 --> 01:17:17,565
I didn't say the nipples.
I said the little bumps around the nipples.

1250
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,999
Yar-Arr-

1251
01:17:20,068 --> 01:17:22,195
That is not a Louisiana pile driver.

1252
01:17:22,270 --> 01:17:26,331
Butyou wouldn't know
about that, would you?. Hmph. Virgin.

1253
01:17:26,408 --> 01:17:28,467
Virgin.

1254
01:17:28,543 --> 01:17:30,909
Areola borealis?.

1255
01:17:30,979 --> 01:17:33,812
Near the-the, um, bumps?.

1256
01:17:35,250 --> 01:17:38,276
That's what you do.
You aim for the eye, grab the lip...

1257
01:17:38,353 --> 01:17:40,150
Iead her around the room-
blinding the marlin.

1258
01:17:40,222 --> 01:17:42,850
God, you're sexy and well-versed.
I like it.

1259
01:17:44,459 --> 01:17:46,324
Okay. Guards!

1260
01:17:46,395 --> 01:17:48,829
- Okay, that's it.
- That's what happens. Okay, I got it. All right.

1261
01:17:48,897 --> 01:17:50,831
- I'm good.
- Bye-bye.

1262
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:55,734
Congratulations.
Mr. Lucas has decided to drop the charges.

1263
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,670
So, what?.
We're free to go, right?.

1264
01:18:00,742 --> 01:18:04,007
Well, not exactly.
He says you can watch the film.

1265
01:18:04,079 --> 01:18:07,446
What?.
We can watch the movie?.

1266
01:18:09,584 --> 01:18:11,745
Hold it. Hold it.
Only you.

1267
01:18:16,758 --> 01:18:18,953
It's good, man.
It's right.

1268
01:18:24,366 --> 01:18:28,200
Hey, are you lonely

1269
01:18:29,538 --> 01:18:33,907
-   Has summer gone so slowly

1270
01:18:33,975 --> 01:18:38,139
We found the ground

1271
01:18:38,213 --> 01:18:42,479
And that damage was done

1272
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:46,317
It's cold
as you fade into the sun

1273
01:18:47,956 --> 01:18:51,119
Where'd you go

1274
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:56,626
To me

1275
01:19:04,306 --> 01:19:06,536
But you're alive

1276
01:19:06,608 --> 01:19:08,633
Well, it's only

1277
01:19:10,145 --> 01:19:14,343
Fallen frames
they told me

1278
01:19:14,416 --> 01:19:17,908
You stand out

1279
01:19:17,986 --> 01:19:21,114
It's so loud
and so what if it is

1280
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:27,427
It's cold as you face
into the wind

1281
01:19:27,496 --> 01:19:29,430
Chewie.

1282
01:19:31,867 --> 01:19:36,031
Tonight the sun
shall see its light

1283
01:19:36,104 --> 01:19:41,201
So what if you catch me
Where would we land

1284
01:19:41,276 --> 01:19:46,771
In somebody's life
for taking his hands

1285
01:19:46,848 --> 01:19:52,081
Sing to me hope
as she's thrown on the sand

1286
01:19:52,154 --> 01:19:57,615
All ofour work
is rated again

1287
01:19:58,794 --> 01:20:00,728
Where to go

1288
01:20:09,104 --> 01:20:12,471
- That's not bad.
- Thanks, man.

1289
01:20:24,019 --> 01:20:27,216
There's something I need to-
I should...

1290
01:20:27,289 --> 01:20:29,314
probably tell you before, uh-

1291
01:20:29,391 --> 01:20:32,519
Before I'm gone.

1292
01:20:32,594 --> 01:20:35,757
You could say it.
I won't hold it against you.

1293
01:20:37,432 --> 01:20:41,266
I just- I wish I could...

1294
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:46,668
change these last three years, you know.

1295
01:20:48,143 --> 01:20:51,442
You know, I wouldn't want you to.

1296
01:20:51,513 --> 01:20:54,004
You gotta keep the flaws.

1297
01:20:54,082 --> 01:20:56,277
Crappy effects.

1298
01:20:56,351 --> 01:20:58,319
Real puppets.

1299
01:20:58,386 --> 01:21:01,048
That's what makes it so good, you know?.

1300
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:03,090
Yeah.

1301
01:21:03,158 --> 01:21:06,753
This was never about the movie.

1302
01:21:06,828 --> 01:21:11,390
You know, this was, uh-
this was about all of us.

1303
01:21:13,168 --> 01:21:15,329
Hey.

1304
01:21:17,973 --> 01:21:21,704
Look at us.
We're together again, freezing our nuts off.

1305
01:21:21,776 --> 01:21:24,040
No teaming up! That's a rule!

1306
01:21:24,112 --> 01:21:26,307
- You're such dicks!

1307
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:29,145
- Both of you are dicks!
- I'm gonna go save him.

1308
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:31,412
- Please.
- You coming?.

1309
01:21:31,486 --> 01:21:34,250
No, I'm good right here.

1310
01:21:35,323 --> 01:21:37,314
All right, man.

1311
01:21:46,167 --> 01:21:48,158
I'm good right here.

1312
01:22:05,186 --> 01:22:06,949
Guys, it's time.

1313
01:22:08,823 --> 01:22:12,782
That better beyour lucky R2 poking me.

1314
01:22:12,861 --> 01:22:15,591
Nope. My penis.

1315
01:22:18,266 --> 01:22:20,200
You guys are gross.

1316
01:22:40,822 --> 01:22:43,313
Any, uh-
Any sign of Hutch?.

1317
01:22:50,732 --> 01:22:53,030
- Talk to me.
- It's me. Where the hell are you?.

1318
01:22:53,101 --> 01:22:55,535
I'm just finishing up
at the garage here, man.

1319
01:22:55,603 --> 01:22:59,232
- Shake a leg, ya bastard. We're saving your place.
- All right.

1320
01:23:09,484 --> 01:23:11,748
Okay!

1321
01:23:11,820 --> 01:23:15,722
Yes! That's awesome.
That's awesome.

1322
01:23:15,790 --> 01:23:18,486
- Hey!
- Hey! Oh, my God!

1323
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:20,494
Right at the buzzer.

1324
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:22,393
Yeah!

1325
01:23:24,332 --> 01:23:27,358
Excuse me.
Are you Eric Bottler?.

1326
01:23:27,435 --> 01:23:28,834
Yeah.

1327
01:23:31,272 --> 01:23:34,571
- We just gotyour new comic.
- Whoa.

1328
01:23:34,642 --> 01:23:37,008
- Thanks, guys. I appreciate that.
- I don't.

1329
01:23:37,078 --> 01:23:39,103
I think it's quite shoddy.

1330
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:42,775
- Worst series ever.
- Total Lucas rip-off!.

1331
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:46,252
- The artwork is neophyte.
- At best.

1332
01:23:46,321 --> 01:23:49,085
- What's up, my nerds?.
- Ah.

1333
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:52,854
Why don't you ask the man for an autograph?.
Ask the man for an autograph!

1334
01:23:54,596 --> 01:23:57,030
