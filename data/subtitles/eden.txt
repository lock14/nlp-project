1
00:00:49,354 --> 00:00:53,807
Come on now, baby girl.
Be quiet now.

2
00:00:55,846 --> 00:00:58,093
Just breathe.

3
00:01:03,044 --> 00:01:05,291
Atta girl.

4
00:01:15,112 --> 00:01:18,108
It won't be too long now.

5
00:02:27,641 --> 00:02:29,491
Hey! Wu.
I'll be out in a minute.

6
00:02:29,492 --> 00:02:31,285
Ok, wait here.

7
00:02:32,052 --> 00:02:33,755
I got you an ID.

8
00:02:37,628 --> 00:02:38,962
It's from Thunderbird Lanes.

9
00:02:38,963 --> 00:02:42,227
It's like lady that traded in for
a sweet pair bowling shoes

10
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,879
or she just plain forgot about it.

11
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,466
But either way it's yours now.

12
00:02:45,767 --> 00:02:47,280
I don't look like an Indian.

13
00:02:47,282 --> 00:02:48,451
It's Native American.

14
00:02:48,452 --> 00:02:51,536
Look, Leah got in with her mom's
employee back from safe way.

15
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:53,158
She dressed really slutty.

16
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:55,722
Oh, you gonna have to bring
me some of your clothes then.

17
00:02:56,462 --> 00:02:58,558
Deal about it.

18
00:02:58,684 --> 00:03:01,546
- Alright I'll see you later.
- Okay. Bye.

19
00:04:33,011 --> 00:04:35,712
Oma! It's like this.

20
00:04:35,847 --> 00:04:42,420
You press the code, enter,
and then the code again. See

21
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:53,865
Add up this weekend. I will
take it to the banker on Monday.

22
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:57,102
Why not I just stay tonight here
and then that way I can ...

23
00:04:57,103 --> 00:04:58,899
I don't want you here at night alone.

24
00:04:58,942 --> 00:05:01,915
Oma!  I'll be fine.
Abbie drive me home.

25
00:05:02,016 --> 00:05:05,779
Hyun Jae, why are
you being coarse with me?

26
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,720
Sorry.

27
00:05:11,966 --> 00:05:16,460
Very well, and
I want you home by ten.

28
00:05:16,585 --> 00:05:20,580
And you must help me clean the
house this weekend, top to bottom.

29
00:05:21,105 --> 00:05:25,313
- I always do.
- Aigo

30
00:05:36,859 --> 00:05:38,240
Don't smile.

31
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:42,040
- What would it be?
- Uhhh. Two shots of whiskey.

32
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:51,572
Not bad.

33
00:05:53,703 --> 00:05:55,534
5 bucks.

34
00:05:56,292 --> 00:05:58,197
Should be about 5.

35
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:03,815
- Alright.
- Cheers!

36
00:06:08,067 --> 00:06:13,314
- Oh it's awesome.
- From a friend the fireman there.

37
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:19,294
- Huh.
- Dude he wants you.

38
00:06:19,952 --> 00:06:23,144
Hey! Eyes on me for a sec.
He bought us these shots.

39
00:06:23,145 --> 00:06:26,144
We gonna go over there
and you're gonna talk to him.

40
00:06:26,326 --> 00:06:29,017
Don't whimp out like
you did at Randy's party.

41
00:06:29,018 --> 00:06:30,813
I didn't whimp out and
I don't wanna go there.

42
00:06:31,637 --> 00:06:36,646
Ohh, I'm serious.
Come on let's go. Come on!

43
00:06:41,807 --> 00:06:45,017
- Hey. I'm Abbie, this is Jae.
- Hey.

44
00:06:45,018 --> 00:06:48,906
- Thanks for the shots.
- Cheers, yeah. Cheers.

45
00:06:56,770 --> 00:07:01,397
So, do you always get so
dress up to put out fires.

46
00:07:02,986 --> 00:07:05,449
I just came from the funeral service.

47
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:08,572
Oh, shit! I'm so sorry.

48
00:07:09,007 --> 00:07:10,436
It's okay.

49
00:07:10,437 --> 00:07:14,044
I'm leaving to get some
smokes. I'll be right back.

50
00:07:15,595 --> 00:07:17,259
Sit down.

51
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:24,708
- Don't worry.  I'm not going to tell.
- What?

52
00:07:25,133 --> 00:07:32,381
- That you're too young to be in here.
- Okay well.  What makes you so sure?

53
00:07:32,664 --> 00:07:36,017
I don't see many
21 year olds with braces.

54
00:07:38,316 --> 00:07:40,088
I think their cute.

55
00:07:45,889 --> 00:07:48,111
Excuse me for a second will you girl?

56
00:08:17,988 --> 00:08:22,298
Thanks for the the ride . Abbie can
just kinda disappear sometimes.

57
00:08:22,723 --> 00:08:26,626
- Is it pass your curfew?
- Maybe.

58
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:30,040
You wanna go home or hang out?

59
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:34,831
Oh. I'm already in a big trouble so...
I might as well make the best out of it.

60
00:08:34,866 --> 00:08:36,780
That's the spirit.

61
00:08:37,004 --> 00:08:40,807
I just have to make a quick phone call.
You don't mind do you?

62
00:08:51,452 --> 00:08:53,707
Just be a minute.

63
00:08:59,543 --> 00:09:02,261
- Okay.
- I love it.

64
00:09:02,262 --> 00:09:04,969
Don't cover your face.
It's too pretty.

65
00:09:06,932 --> 00:09:08,280
Come here.

66
00:09:23,585 --> 00:09:26,097
I'll be right back.

67
00:09:46,746 --> 00:09:48,785
SAMPLE

68
00:10:11,997 --> 00:10:17,210
Yeah. I heard you put on a
rotation today. It's just fantastic.

69
00:10:18,403 --> 00:10:24,927
Now I'll be little late. Maybe fourth
or fifth twenty, sixth at the latest.

70
00:10:25,052 --> 00:10:27,480
You'll still beyond the mound, right?

71
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:35,743
Listen I can't really hear you
too well on this mobile phone.

72
00:10:35,844 --> 00:10:38,405
But I'll be seeing you soon.

73
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:45,501
Yeah. I love you too.
Alright boy. Bye bye.

74
00:11:26,201 --> 00:11:31,915
- Hope I'm not intruding gentlemen.
- You from the marshal's office?

75
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:33,521
Bob Gault.

76
00:11:33,622 --> 00:11:37,739
Ellis.  And this is
Mr. Alawa, it is his property.

77
00:11:37,754 --> 00:11:42,218
I saw your cruiser.
Let's see if I can lend a hand.

78
00:11:42,343 --> 00:11:45,994
- Ok with you if I take a look?
- Fine with me.

79
00:11:51,685 --> 00:11:56,732
- Anyone seen it this besides you Mr Alawa?
- No, sir.

80
00:11:57,191 --> 00:12:01,071
- And you live alone?
- Yes, sir.

81
00:12:04,574 --> 00:12:08,329
I'm gonna put this down.

82
00:12:19,257 --> 00:12:22,001
Did you see she's got
a tethered strap to her?

83
00:12:23,171 --> 00:12:24,253
Uh-huh.

84
00:12:24,188 --> 00:12:27,090
You know we can get an address
on her, she was under house arrest.

85
00:12:29,309 --> 00:12:34,356
- You called this in yet, deputy?
- Oh no, sir, not yet. I was just ...

86
00:13:37,465 --> 00:13:42,400
No! No! Please!
No! No! No! No!

87
00:14:56,132 --> 00:14:59,761
I...I don't know where I am.

88
00:15:00,086 --> 00:15:04,627
I need to go home, I need tell
my parents where I am. No, no.

89
00:15:04,962 --> 00:15:07,814
- Be still for me!
- No!

90
00:15:08,496 --> 00:15:10,758
Ivan, hold her down.

91
00:15:13,468 --> 00:15:18,987
I don't know where I am.
I should call my mom and dad.

92
00:16:45,414 --> 00:16:47,119
Wakey! Wakey! Ladies!

93
00:16:51,088 --> 00:16:53,148
- Come on. Line up
- Come out.

94
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:11,847
Oh look at there!

95
00:17:14,989 --> 00:17:17,241
Svetlana, come on up here.

96
00:17:21,195 --> 00:17:22,353
Take one.

97
00:17:31,214 --> 00:17:37,214
All of you, come on.
Come on. Yeah.

98
00:17:41,599 --> 00:17:43,473
Pretty cute aren't they?

99
00:17:43,774 --> 00:17:47,803
There you go.
Ahh, you got a sweet one there.

100
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:50,418
Come on, pick one.

101
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:57,507
I'm putting you each in charge
in one of  these creatures.

102
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:01,576
Consider it a exercise
and accountability.

103
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:06,626
Take it from me,
this world is a harsh place.

104
00:18:07,335 --> 00:18:11,879
Anything could happen with this innocent
life you're holding in your hand.

105
00:18:12,632 --> 00:18:18,514
Out there, 50 miles of waste
land in every direction.

106
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:24,507
And I don't wanna find your
kitten rotting in some coyote trap

107
00:18:24,542 --> 00:18:30,193
like I did your friend
Maria today.  Go on.

108
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:35,378
Now maybe some of you
have had a pet before.

109
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:41,747
But if not, I can tell you, it is
one of life's great pleasure.

110
00:18:41,873 --> 00:18:47,378
There's nothing like the
unconditional love of an animal.

111
00:18:47,504 --> 00:18:50,866
If you all keep yourselves lying here

112
00:18:50,967 --> 00:18:55,716
they always have these old guys
to keep you warm if you asleep at night.

113
00:18:55,751 --> 00:19:02,564
But if you squander this opportunity.
Well, I'm sure you won't.

114
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:07,341
Alright ladies, take your cats out in
the courtyard so they could shit. Alright.

115
00:19:07,467 --> 00:19:09,283
And you better clean up
after the motherfucker ...

116
00:19:09,284 --> 00:19:10,341
Vaughan, for God's sake.

117
00:19:10,342 --> 00:19:13,030
- As long as I don't see any shit.
- Okay.

118
00:19:14,031 --> 00:19:17,383
- Who picked her up?
- Mario.

119
00:19:17,384 --> 00:19:19,059
She is from Tucson or anything.

120
00:19:19,094 --> 00:19:20,815
- Is this her stuff?
- Yeah.

121
00:19:22,015 --> 00:19:23,870
Let me see.

122
00:19:30,032 --> 00:19:35,137
Well, it looks like your father filled
out this missing persons report at...

123
00:19:35,263 --> 00:19:39,801
Gifts & Taxidermy in
Las Cruces, New Mexico.

124
00:19:40,851 --> 00:19:48,561
Parents got their
Green Cards in February 1986.

125
00:19:49,403 --> 00:19:56,998
And you all became
U.S. citizens in September 1993.

126
00:19:58,662 --> 00:20:00,483
Hyun Jae.

127
00:20:01,384 --> 00:20:05,649
Wouldn't have picked you for an American
girl with that name, that's for sure.

128
00:20:08,831 --> 00:20:13,636
Eden's Garden.
Well, lofty name for a trailer park.

129
00:20:14,263 --> 00:20:19,309
Eden is a Hebrew word.
It means delight.

130
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:21,114
Think it fits?

131
00:20:23,898 --> 00:20:27,965
Maybe you fit that name.
You think Vaughan?

132
00:20:28,528 --> 00:20:32,378
- Yeah.
- Well, that settles it.

133
00:20:33,283 --> 00:20:39,680
Listen, I'm gonna give you a day
or two to shake off the shock of this.

134
00:20:39,682 --> 00:20:43,168
And then you gonna have to
try to fit in to what we do here.

135
00:20:43,294 --> 00:20:44,921
My rules are simple.

136
00:20:44,922 --> 00:20:48,608
Bath twice a day.
Mornings and evenings.

137
00:20:48,716 --> 00:20:50,618
And after sexual intercourse.

138
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:55,868
Put yourself to a medical check up
everyday.    This is a clean facility.

139
00:20:56,557 --> 00:21:02,689
The cleaner you are, the better this
is gonna be for you, and everybody else.

140
00:21:04,234 --> 00:21:09,391
Oh uhh, and I'm sure
I don't have to explain to you,

141
00:21:09,392 --> 00:21:13,933
the consequences to your family
if you cause trouble for me.

142
00:21:15,118 --> 00:21:17,678
Because I have your address.

143
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:22,705
No, I have everything.
Hmm?

144
00:22:07,716 --> 00:22:12,471
- What do I do with this?
- You pee on it.

145
00:22:13,457 --> 00:22:15,850
Which part?

146
00:22:36,206 --> 00:22:37,734
Cat scratches.

147
00:22:37,735 --> 00:22:43,397
You have to cut those kitties nails,
and yours too . Goes with Svetlana.

148
00:22:55,167 --> 00:22:59,420
Oh your bruises
will be okay in no time.

149
00:23:03,276 --> 00:23:06,686
Do you know how I got
over my fear of needles?

150
00:23:07,572 --> 00:23:14,146
I just think about somebody sawing
my arm in half with a chainsaw.

151
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:21,975
Then this little needle feels like nothing.
Okay. You can go.

152
00:24:03,298 --> 00:24:04,508
You.

153
00:24:06,676 --> 00:24:08,386
You.

154
00:24:09,037 --> 00:24:13,267
- And you.
- Put on that shit and go with Avni.

155
00:24:13,851 --> 00:24:17,959
Alright. The rest of you girls are
in office with this fucking cats!

156
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:20,601
They going really start to piss me off.

157
00:24:20,636 --> 00:24:23,611
Alright.
Death certificates, social security cards.

158
00:24:23,612 --> 00:24:24,770
I need you to match them together.

159
00:24:24,771 --> 00:24:27,050
The nurse will come and take it
from you when they're done.

160
00:24:27,052 --> 00:24:30,534
Curly-Q, you and Eden.

161
00:24:32,246 --> 00:24:34,497
Eden!  Take this.

162
00:24:34,498 --> 00:24:37,683
You have to come with me.
Alright put them on.

163
00:24:41,506 --> 00:24:43,298
Go!

164
00:24:58,639 --> 00:25:00,883
Hey.
Do you know where we're going?

165
00:25:00,884 --> 00:25:03,894
Hey!  Shut up back there.
I don't wanna hear you talking.

166
00:25:03,895 --> 00:25:05,503
No whispering.

167
00:25:46,917 --> 00:25:48,209
Come here.

168
00:25:51,246 --> 00:25:53,553
God damn it! If you don't
go in there right now,

169
00:25:53,554 --> 00:25:56,146
I'm going to take a cigar cutter
and cut your fucking clit off.

170
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:58,543
Hey Vaughan!
Don't be an asshole.  She is new.

171
00:25:58,744 --> 00:26:00,668
It's okay, sweetie.

172
00:26:09,849 --> 00:26:12,352
Okay, just stay over here.

173
00:26:13,145 --> 00:26:16,314
Now, I just need you to kneel down.

174
00:26:21,737 --> 00:26:25,816
I just gonna take your hand.
It's not going to hurt.

175
00:26:26,241 --> 00:26:29,328
Just gonna handcuffed you, that's all.

176
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:34,057
Just gonna play a little game.

177
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:35,816
I just wanna go home.
I don't want to be here anymore.

178
00:28:32,426 --> 00:28:33,636
Hands.

179
00:28:35,504 --> 00:28:39,884
You got to smile. I mean you can't
act like a fucking robot all the time.

180
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:45,674
I'm sick and tired of dealing with mutant
and psychotics all day.  Look at me!

181
00:28:46,099 --> 00:28:48,039
You gotta smile for the client.

182
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:50,617
If you don't, I'm gonna cut off one of
your legs and then fuck the bloody stump.

183
00:28:50,618 --> 00:28:51,702
You understand?

184
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,568
Smile.

185
00:28:56,318 --> 00:28:58,946
Good!
Alright. Hop out.

186
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:07,121
Yes.

187
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:09,957
Come in.

188
00:29:13,836 --> 00:29:18,300
- So, is she good to head?
- Yes, sir.

189
00:29:38,571 --> 00:29:42,215
Is everything all right?
Oh my god!

190
00:29:42,826 --> 00:29:46,960
- Holy! Fucking shit!
- Fuck!

191
00:30:11,256 --> 00:30:14,125
What's happening to me?
Help me!  Please.

192
00:30:14,152 --> 00:30:15,072
What's going on?

193
00:30:15,073 --> 00:30:18,538
I'm sorry. It's alright. I'm a cop.
It's over. Don't worry about it.

194
00:30:18,573 --> 00:30:19,528
I'm going to call the police.

195
00:30:19,529 --> 00:30:22,685
Stop! Stop! Stop! I've got it under control.
She's an addict. She is very dangerous.

196
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,027
You don't wanna get mixed up in this.
You might get hurt.

197
00:30:25,062 --> 00:30:27,021
I'm really sorry about this

198
00:30:29,208 --> 00:30:31,252
Help me!

199
00:30:48,437 --> 00:30:53,553
It doesn't matter if you scream.
They are cowards, anyways

200
00:31:44,246 --> 00:31:46,349
I need a fucking cigarette.

201
00:31:47,233 --> 00:31:50,804
Leave her ass in it until morning.
See if she is still alive.

202
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:04,994
Have I ever been unclear about
your job description, Vaughan?

203
00:32:05,019 --> 00:32:06,755
I fucking caught her.

204
00:32:06,956 --> 00:32:09,813
But you didn't catch
that Mexican one, did you?

205
00:32:10,775 --> 00:32:16,280
Do you have any clue what I have
to do when you don't catch them?

206
00:32:17,658 --> 00:32:23,288
I knew it.  This is why the
shepherd looses his sheep.

207
00:32:23,414 --> 00:32:26,611
You know if I wanted a
junkie running my operation,

208
00:32:26,712 --> 00:32:29,113
I can head down to the
strip and have my pick.

209
00:32:29,462 --> 00:32:30,968
I have you here

210
00:32:30,969 --> 00:32:34,123
because I thought you were serious
about rising up in this organization.

211
00:32:34,124 --> 00:32:35,371
I am, Bob.

212
00:32:35,372 --> 00:32:38,049
Yeah, that better become
much more apparent.

213
00:32:40,181 --> 00:32:44,962
I'm getting tired of having to ask.

214
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:08,367
I want you to get rid of all
the goddamn cats in this facility.

215
00:33:08,368 --> 00:33:11,973
Just get rid of them.  Fucking
sell 'em, drown 'em in the river.

216
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:15,731
Do you need me ask please?

217
00:33:15,732 --> 00:33:19,101
Please.  Can you
fucking do this?  Right now.

218
00:34:21,665 --> 00:34:23,891
I didn't think she liked that cat.

219
00:34:25,110 --> 00:34:26,842
I wonder why they want to keep it?

220
00:34:29,047 --> 00:34:32,217
Home.
El ruisenor sings for her master.

221
00:34:32,218 --> 00:34:33,385
What does that mean?

222
00:34:34,178 --> 00:34:36,347
Nightingale.

223
00:34:36,638 --> 00:34:39,725
She used to be tagged
with this girl Bella.

224
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:42,282
And about 2 years ago

225
00:34:42,383 --> 00:34:45,910
Bella tried to get one of the
regular johns to sneak them out.

226
00:34:46,441 --> 00:34:48,753
And the guy reported
it back to Vaughan.

227
00:34:48,854 --> 00:34:53,174
Vaughan beat the shit
out of Bella.   Killed her.

228
00:34:53,447 --> 00:34:56,034
Svetlana watched the whole thing.

229
00:34:56,159 --> 00:35:01,748
She became Vaughan's little
ruisenora after that.  His nightingale.

230
00:35:01,873 --> 00:35:05,965
She tells him whenever we screw
up and she gets her pick of jobs.

231
00:35:08,381 --> 00:35:12,093
It's probably how she got my ring.

232
00:35:13,303 --> 00:35:14,813
How long has she been here?

233
00:35:14,814 --> 00:35:18,199
Long enough for a pussy
to be made of iron by now.

234
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:24,532
I'm glad you're here.
Well, you know, not here but...

235
00:35:24,557 --> 00:35:26,675
It's okay.
I know what you mean.

236
00:35:26,976 --> 00:35:29,250
How long have you been here?

237
00:35:29,279 --> 00:35:32,367
Three years.
They move us around sometimes.

238
00:35:32,568 --> 00:35:35,523
Last year they sent me
to this place called Dubai.

239
00:35:35,558 --> 00:35:38,037
- How old are you?
- What's this year?

240
00:35:38,163 --> 00:35:40,206
1995.

241
00:35:40,582 --> 00:35:44,795
- 15.  How old are you?
- 19

242
00:35:45,795 --> 00:35:50,829
- Shit.  Did they know you that old?
- I don't know.   Why?

243
00:35:53,262 --> 00:35:57,414
- Why?  What do they do?
- I don't know.

244
00:36:00,269 --> 00:36:03,204
Hey, this color is way bright.

245
00:36:04,524 --> 00:36:06,087
Come with me.

246
00:36:07,694 --> 00:36:10,026
- Oh hold on, just finishing ...
- Now!

247
00:36:59,166 --> 00:37:01,335
Number seven.

248
00:37:18,853 --> 00:37:21,856
So mister, what's your name?

249
00:37:22,564 --> 00:37:24,000
Bill.

250
00:37:24,901 --> 00:37:29,072
You've nice eyes, Bill.
You're so handsome.

251
00:37:29,197 --> 00:37:34,369
- You say that to everyone.
- No, I like you, Bill.

252
00:37:36,706 --> 00:37:40,493
- So what's your name?
- Eden.

253
00:37:41,752 --> 00:37:46,015
- And where are you from, Eden?
- China.

254
00:37:46,716 --> 00:37:52,617
-Oh yeah? Where?
- Just China.

255
00:37:59,647 --> 00:38:02,974
Okay, Bill.
What do you want?

256
00:38:02,975 --> 00:38:07,352
You want me to take control?
Or you take control?

257
00:39:43,832 --> 00:39:45,836
Where's your little friend?

258
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:56,124
Give me my ring back!
Give it to me!

259
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:57,448
Give me my ring back!

260
00:41:11,684 --> 00:41:14,437
What the hell is this?

261
00:41:27,534 --> 00:41:30,471
I want to know how long you
hid that heel up your snatch?

262
00:41:30,672 --> 00:41:34,847
I mean this is nice.
What are those? Sterling silver?

263
00:41:37,003 --> 00:41:40,592
I don't give a fuck what happened between
you and that dirty whore Svetlana.

264
00:41:40,593 --> 00:41:42,017
I'm sure she had it coming.

265
00:41:42,052 --> 00:41:44,634
But I do need to punish
you for the contraband.

266
00:41:44,935 --> 00:41:47,000
So open your mouth.

267
00:41:49,934 --> 00:41:51,739
Open your fucking mouth.

268
00:41:54,395 --> 00:41:56,486
Eat it!
Swallow it!

269
00:42:02,196 --> 00:42:03,582
Oh god.
Let me see.

270
00:42:07,765 --> 00:42:09,457
That's outstanding.

271
00:42:10,329 --> 00:42:13,527
You know you're not suppose to
be old enough to have graduated?

272
00:42:16,211 --> 00:42:18,080
Alright, enough talking.
Let's go.

273
00:42:18,581 --> 00:42:22,508
Back inside.
Come on, let's go.

274
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:25,617
I know why you came up
short the other night.

275
00:42:27,431 --> 00:42:30,364
You charge the same for those Russian
girls as you do for the rest of us,

276
00:42:30,465 --> 00:42:32,595
but the white girls cost more.

277
00:42:32,597 --> 00:42:34,300
What the fuck are you talking about?

278
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:36,757
They always take advantage of you.

279
00:42:36,792 --> 00:42:38,181
Who takes advantage of me?

280
00:42:38,182 --> 00:42:41,367
They all do, and they all
laugh behind your back, and

281
00:42:41,445 --> 00:42:45,242
the bouncer from the Petting Zoo calls
you "Section A", or something like that.

282
00:42:45,367 --> 00:42:46,731
You're full of shit.

283
00:42:46,832 --> 00:42:49,537
Now, why would I lie about that?
I don't even know what it means.

284
00:42:51,832 --> 00:42:56,211
I've...
I can help you keep track of things.

285
00:42:56,237 --> 00:42:58,961
You know I've been doing it in
my parents' store since I was nine.

286
00:42:59,362 --> 00:43:03,084
So I... I can help you.

287
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,230
You wanna help me?
You wanna be a part of this shit?

288
00:43:06,231 --> 00:43:07,911
Yeah

289
00:43:08,434 --> 00:43:09,810
Why?

290
00:43:09,935 --> 00:43:13,095
I just turned 19, so I'm done, right.
I'm a damaged goods.

291
00:43:13,396 --> 00:43:14,950
Look, I don't give a fuck!

292
00:43:14,985 --> 00:43:16,442
- I'm fucked and you know it.

293
00:43:16,567 --> 00:43:19,069
You're not fucked, you're not the one
that decides whether or not you're fucked.

294
00:43:19,070 --> 00:43:20,552
So you're the one that decides then.

295
00:43:20,553 --> 00:43:23,870
Yes!  I am the one that
decides. That is my job.

296
00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:31,374
If nothing going to changed then just
end it now, please. Just pull the....

297
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,377
Oh come on. Stop it!
Enough! Jesus!

298
00:43:37,714 --> 00:43:39,615
Get back inside right now.

299
00:43:41,636 --> 00:43:45,931
You drive me crazy.
Get back inside right now.

300
00:44:09,957 --> 00:44:12,794
- Are you Josh?
- No, he's not here.

301
00:44:12,919 --> 00:44:15,463
- What?
- He's not here yet.

302
00:44:15,589 --> 00:44:19,885
Well ... uhmm,
he's got something for me.

303
00:44:20,009 --> 00:44:23,263
Oh yeah, yeah. He's gonna be
back with some more cash but...

304
00:44:23,389 --> 00:44:27,559
I can give you half and some
coke or joe until he gets here.

305
00:44:27,684 --> 00:44:29,728
Come on man.

306
00:44:29,854 --> 00:44:34,733
Come on, these guys going
to be leaving in five minutes.

307
00:44:36,443 --> 00:44:40,406
- Alright.
- Alright.  Ladies.

308
00:45:25,163 --> 00:45:32,426
- Hey man, can I get a hit of that?
- You go fuck yourself.

309
00:45:50,439 --> 00:45:53,358
Eden, will you follow me?
Come on.

310
00:45:53,484 --> 00:45:58,256
You two stay right there or I douse
your vagulates with a fucking match.

311
00:46:03,244 --> 00:46:05,393
- Are you Josh?
- Yeah.

312
00:46:05,394 --> 00:46:06,579
Where the fuck is my money?

313
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:10,022
Chill man, I wasn't
going to run off with it.

314
00:46:11,946 --> 00:46:13,153
Count them.

315
00:46:13,154 --> 00:46:15,188
What Brant gave you
it should be all seven.

316
00:46:15,633 --> 00:46:17,930
Actually it's 1000,
because you kept us late.

317
00:46:17,931 --> 00:46:20,580
What do you mean?
The other guy said 700.

318
00:46:20,615 --> 00:46:22,130
- No. It's a thousand.
- It's a thousand.

319
00:46:22,157 --> 00:46:25,109
- Is she a hooker or she a cashier?
- Is that any of your fucking business?

320
00:46:25,133 --> 00:46:26,819
Hey! I'm not trying
to fuck with you okay.

321
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:29,672
They said 700 a day,
that's what we put together.

322
00:46:29,707 --> 00:46:32,943
- Fuck you!  How much does he owe me?
- 300.

323
00:46:33,068 --> 00:46:38,323
- Give me $ 300, right the fuck now.
- Just give it.

324
00:46:43,704 --> 00:46:45,207
Give it to her.

325
00:46:49,778 --> 00:46:52,364
We're good, thank you.

326
00:47:04,726 --> 00:47:07,146
Get them up!

327
00:47:10,108 --> 00:47:11,777
Fucking piece of shit!

328
00:47:49,066 --> 00:47:51,405
You should take care of this.
You deserve it.

329
00:48:57,664 --> 00:49:00,600
Can I use the bathroom?

330
00:50:11,717 --> 00:50:13,136
You.

331
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:19,826
Achtung, motherfuckers!  Today is
going to be a good day.  I can feel it.

332
00:50:20,227 --> 00:50:21,562
You.

333
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:25,429
Svetlana, guess what?
You're going out today.

334
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:27,278
You're going with Ivan in the van.

335
00:50:28,026 --> 00:50:31,363
Fall out.
It means follow me.

336
00:50:41,540 --> 00:50:45,562
You're going to clean this entire
place, and you've got do a good job.

337
00:50:45,587 --> 00:50:48,373
All this windows and fucking
doors they all have alarms on,

338
00:50:48,374 --> 00:50:50,769
so I swear to god Eden,
if you get back to your old tricks,

339
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:53,243
I am going to shoot a hole on you
with every fucking gun that I have.

340
00:50:55,514 --> 00:50:58,646
Cleaning supplies.
Get to it.

341
00:52:48,259 --> 00:52:52,838
Alright, Eden's going to take over for
the phones. You guys gonna switch up.

342
00:52:54,975 --> 00:52:56,601
What?

343
00:52:57,019 --> 00:53:02,858
- That stupid girl will not replace me!
- What the hell are you talking about.

344
00:53:02,983 --> 00:53:04,430
Don't replace me!

345
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:05,959
I never said anything
about replacing you.

346
00:53:06,037 --> 00:53:07,940
I said she's gonna answer
the phones, and you'll drive.

347
00:53:07,941 --> 00:53:09,368
I can't fucking drive.

348
00:53:09,403 --> 00:53:13,860
- Ivan's gonna teach you how to drive.
- Fuck Ivan. Fuck you!

349
00:53:17,915 --> 00:53:19,288
Alright! Fuck it!

350
00:53:19,289 --> 00:53:22,434
I'll send you back to Dubai where
you can get dicked by donkeys all day.

351
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:25,643
Oh! Look at that.
You're rational all of a sudden.

352
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:33,307
- Can I have a cigarette please?
- Well, depends if you act like a fucked child?

353
00:53:33,432 --> 00:53:37,478
Nitchevo. No. I will not.

354
00:53:37,603 --> 00:53:41,047
Yeah. Go ahead.
Go have a smoke.

355
00:53:43,193 --> 00:53:45,088
Leave the fucking cat.

356
00:54:13,099 --> 00:54:14,532
Uhh, okay. So.

357
00:54:14,733 --> 00:54:17,845
The only people that would
have this number are regular

358
00:54:17,846 --> 00:54:20,278
costumers that we deal
with on a regular basis.

359
00:54:20,482 --> 00:54:21,602
They already know the codes,

360
00:54:21,603 --> 00:54:24,690
so the first thing you need to
know is base means raise, alright.

361
00:54:24,691 --> 00:54:26,527
Never mention anything about people.

362
00:54:26,780 --> 00:54:29,094
We've got a cheat sheet here, alright.

363
00:54:29,095 --> 00:54:33,650
5 x 5 is Hispanic, 5 x 9 Indian or
Pakistani or whatever the fuck is,

364
00:54:33,651 --> 00:54:37,641
5 x 12 is you! Asian.
We got 6 x 9 black.

365
00:54:37,676 --> 00:54:39,335
9 x 10 white.

366
00:54:39,878 --> 00:54:42,947
Ahm. If they ask for a special
you mix it up like a bakers dozen.

367
00:54:42,948 --> 00:54:45,089
So, have them memorized by tonight.

368
00:54:45,425 --> 00:54:46,481
Oh, what about price?

369
00:54:46,482 --> 00:54:49,137
Never mention price. They
already know the price. Alright.

370
00:54:49,145 --> 00:54:52,758
If they ask for it, it's probably the Fed's
or whatever. Just hang up the phone.

371
00:54:53,483 --> 00:54:57,313
I mean, all you have to do is you write
down the address, fucking date, time.

372
00:54:57,437 --> 00:55:02,402
Rip it off. Give it to me.
You got that?

373
00:55:02,735 --> 00:55:03,903
Yeah.

374
00:55:04,862 --> 00:55:07,882
Alright, I'm gonna throw something
by you.   What is a 5 x 9?

375
00:55:08,383 --> 00:55:11,657
- Indian or Pakistani?
- Perfect.

376
00:55:11,692 --> 00:55:12,980
You're going to be great at this.

377
00:55:12,981 --> 00:55:15,981
I'm going to run away right now for a
couple of hours, I'm going to Cold Storage.

378
00:55:16,008 --> 00:55:19,198
But, if you get bored
just play the fucking cat.

379
00:55:42,777 --> 00:55:45,297
Let them out, but you
gonna re-cuff them okay.

380
00:55:48,492 --> 00:55:51,579
How you doing?
How was the flight?

381
00:56:20,818 --> 00:56:24,490
- How you doing, Dave?
- I'm alright men.

382
00:56:24,615 --> 00:56:27,984
- My fucking dog died.
- Oh fuck man, I'm sorry.

383
00:56:28,110 --> 00:56:29,755
I mean she was 15 years old.

384
00:56:29,756 --> 00:56:32,787
But such a tall sweet heart.
You know. You remember.

385
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:34,600
Yeah dude, she was a beautiful dog.

386
00:56:36,168 --> 00:56:40,714
Let's try this new batch which is
the Persian white mixed with the red.

387
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:43,320
And like, you know the plants are
young but they're really strong,

388
00:56:43,321 --> 00:56:44,926
so I just cut the
normal dose in a half.

389
00:56:45,227 --> 00:56:46,744
Oh alright, thank you.

390
00:56:47,972 --> 00:56:50,258
Oh yeah, give me ...
take out your arm.

391
00:56:50,259 --> 00:56:52,308
Give him your fucking arm!

392
00:57:07,893 --> 00:57:10,238
Are you alright?
Focus on this, hold this.

393
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:11,779
Oh man, don't make her hold those.

394
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:12,488
Focus on this.

395
00:57:12,490 --> 00:57:15,794
Don't grab it.  Shit.
Alright, how long till she comes down?

396
00:57:15,919 --> 00:57:19,297
With that application
I'd say, an hour?

397
00:57:19,422 --> 00:57:21,471
Well that's fucking perfect.
Great.

398
00:57:21,472 --> 00:57:22,620
I'm going to teach you how to drive.

399
00:57:22,821 --> 00:57:25,925
Are you ready?
Let's do it.  Go that way.

400
00:57:27,371 --> 00:57:29,240
Thanks, Dave.
I'll see you in a month.

401
00:57:30,292 --> 00:57:32,336
Keep going that way.

402
00:57:34,146 --> 00:57:38,085
The nurse gets all of our syringes from
a medical warehouse down at Reno.

403
00:57:38,109 --> 00:57:40,591
Can you not hit the gas and
the brake at the same time?

404
00:57:40,592 --> 00:57:42,610
It doesn't work that way.

405
00:57:42,823 --> 00:57:46,159
You know we all get this tracking
bracelets from the parole board,

406
00:57:46,285 --> 00:57:48,912
because Bob knows
everyfucking body there and...

407
00:57:49,037 --> 00:57:52,153
our Pakistani affiliate they
give us all the passports,

408
00:57:52,154 --> 00:57:54,082
and licenses,
all that good stuff and...

409
00:57:54,117 --> 00:57:56,061
Can you just pull the
car over right now?

410
00:57:56,062 --> 00:57:58,056
Stop it, right!
I'm getting sick.

411
00:57:59,924 --> 00:58:02,016
We get the opium breaks
down from Mexico.

412
00:58:02,017 --> 00:58:04,306
I mean, we are the only outfit
that does that type of trade.

413
00:58:04,386 --> 00:58:06,506
I mean, that morphine.

414
00:58:06,507 --> 00:58:09,081
Before that you couldn't
get anybody to do anything.

415
00:58:09,116 --> 00:58:11,458
Now it's like we control
everything on this fucking farm...

416
00:58:11,459 --> 00:58:13,636
I mean you're on
the ground floor of like this...

417
00:58:14,206 --> 00:58:17,102
It’s most well-run, the
most professional operation

418
00:58:17,103 --> 00:58:19,593
is because we work
every fucking angle.

419
00:58:19,628 --> 00:58:21,963
I mean Bob isn't even
the head of these things.

420
00:58:21,964 --> 00:58:23,092
We're bigger than Bob.

421
00:58:23,224 --> 00:58:26,952
And these girls are better off anyway.
Their junkie parents don't care about them.

422
00:58:27,077 --> 00:58:30,749
They let them get catch diseases,
all kinds of crazy shit.  It's sad.

423
00:58:30,873 --> 00:58:35,086
I mean, Svetlana's mom sold her
to her grandfather at nine years old

424
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:40,008
because mommy's new boyfriend didn't
want a brat running around the house.

425
00:58:40,134 --> 00:58:44,597
It's fucked.
That's when she goes too far.

426
00:58:48,684 --> 00:58:51,980
What the fuck is wrong with you?

427
00:58:57,318 --> 00:59:02,364
I should not given you that
amphetamine after that morphine shot.

428
00:59:15,046 --> 00:59:18,007
Do you want take control?

429
00:59:18,132 --> 00:59:21,469
You want me take control?

430
00:59:21,594 --> 00:59:28,227
I'm not one of those motherfuckers.
I'm not one of those pricks okay.

431
00:59:28,351 --> 00:59:31,771
Just fuck away from me and drive.

432
00:59:35,442 --> 00:59:40,197
How can a 19 year old, don't
know how to fucking drive?

433
01:00:05,349 --> 01:00:09,770
I want you to think of the world
in America as blood vessels.

434
01:00:09,895 --> 01:00:13,370
Pumping nutrients and
oxygen and keep the cells alive.

435
01:00:13,371 --> 01:00:15,839
Just like in any living organism.

436
01:00:16,318 --> 01:00:17,904
But what we forget

437
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:21,950
is that the blood in
these vessels transport

438
01:00:21,951 --> 01:00:25,331
waste products away
from those same cells.

439
01:00:25,912 --> 01:00:30,083
What happens then?
Where did they go?

440
01:00:31,669 --> 01:00:35,871
Now these waste products,
well, depending on what they are,

441
01:00:35,972 --> 01:00:38,971
they adapt to their environment.

442
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:45,851
And like any virus they
eventually sabotage the system.

443
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:49,671
That's the best way
I can explain illicit trade.

444
01:00:51,273 --> 01:00:55,862
Now this is what your
average mule looks like.

445
01:00:57,280 --> 01:00:59,990
That's old guy there.

446
01:01:05,663 --> 01:01:10,918
Who would ever suspect granny
Clampert have such depravity?

447
01:01:11,378 --> 01:01:17,593
That nice old gal dumped more dust
on Vegas than Chernobyl in '86.

448
01:01:17,718 --> 01:01:19,963
It took us five years to bring her in.

449
01:01:20,564 --> 01:01:24,099
Then high school drop out,

450
01:01:24,350 --> 01:01:28,062
your housewives, bikers,

451
01:01:28,688 --> 01:01:31,471
debutantes.
You name it.

452
01:01:31,872 --> 01:01:35,342
So, who you looking for?

453
01:01:35,945 --> 01:01:40,527
The answer, is everybody.

454
01:01:41,243 --> 01:01:46,865
Well.  So travel safely, ladies and
gentlemen.  Nice to talking to you.

455
01:01:51,754 --> 01:01:55,758
- Gets me out of the office.
- Marshall Gault!

456
01:01:57,927 --> 01:02:02,641
- Ron Greer. From Stoke Canyon.
- Lake Havasu right? Bus terminal?

457
01:02:02,766 --> 01:02:05,066
No, I called your
office a couple of times.

458
01:02:05,067 --> 01:02:08,698
Figured I'd touch base real
quick since we are both here.

459
01:02:09,064 --> 01:02:12,609
Right...
Remind me what you called about?

460
01:02:12,735 --> 01:02:15,687
A double homicide in
the canyons last year.

461
01:02:15,688 --> 01:02:18,810
Deputy Sheriff named
Dale Ellis and Albert Alawa.

462
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:21,690
Lord.
How are your leads coming?

463
01:02:21,691 --> 01:02:23,896
Well, that's why
I want to talk to you.

464
01:02:24,123 --> 01:02:27,405
See, we have you in that
area at that dang time.

465
01:02:27,406 --> 01:02:30,956
In that area...
You sure about that?

466
01:02:30,991 --> 01:02:34,548
Well, we have been testing out
this Global Positioning System.

467
01:02:34,549 --> 01:02:36,909
- Uh-huh.
- Usually doesn't amount to jack.

468
01:02:36,944 --> 01:02:40,725
Accept it picks up cellphone
activity every now and then.

469
01:02:40,726 --> 01:02:44,247
So anyway we gave a shot,
and your cellular number came up.

470
01:02:44,248 --> 01:02:48,012
Not in exact location,
about a mile from Raven Creek.

471
01:02:48,231 --> 01:02:50,099
But within near shot
of that crime scene.

472
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,054
I'll be damned.

473
01:02:52,089 --> 01:02:54,090
Well, I surely hope not.

474
01:02:55,256 --> 01:02:57,354
Well, maybe this isn't a good time,

475
01:02:57,355 --> 01:03:00,015
I could come by and
talk to you at your office?

476
01:03:00,244 --> 01:03:01,260
Well I don't know,

477
01:03:01,261 --> 01:03:04,630
what I tell you in my office is
different from what I tell you here

478
01:03:04,631 --> 01:03:07,563
which is that I don't recall
being in that area.

479
01:03:07,598 --> 01:03:10,198
And I surely don't recall
opening on two dead bodies.

480
01:03:10,199 --> 01:03:12,824
I mean, that's the
kind of a thing that

481
01:03:12,825 --> 01:03:15,718
usually sticks with a person,
wouldn't you say?

482
01:03:15,812 --> 01:03:18,147
Well, I would think so. Yeah.

483
01:03:18,305 --> 01:03:23,702
But I'll make sure to give you a ring
if anything else springs to mind, Mr. ...

484
01:03:23,828 --> 01:03:25,124
Greer.

485
01:03:25,225 --> 01:03:29,544
Well thank you for your time.
That's an excellent speech.

486
01:03:44,333 --> 01:03:49,463
- Dusty Oasis, may I help you?
- I need two 7 x 10 units.

487
01:03:49,588 --> 01:03:56,345
- Okay. And can I get your address, please?
- 129 Desert Sun Drive, Room 412.

488
01:03:56,471 --> 01:04:01,726
Desert Sun Drive, Room 412,
and the best time to reach you?

489
01:04:01,850 --> 01:04:05,521
- 10 o'clock tonight.
- Great. Okay thank you.

490
01:04:05,647 --> 01:04:07,690
How much?

491
01:04:15,991 --> 01:04:19,578
- Excuse me?
- Well how much is it?

492
01:04:29,005 --> 01:04:33,366
- Sorry it's 600.
- Okay, thanks.

493
01:04:34,167 --> 01:04:36,058
Thank you.

494
01:05:23,104 --> 01:05:26,190
What have we got?

495
01:05:27,817 --> 01:05:31,071
- We got one for tonight.
- Yeah.

496
01:05:31,821 --> 01:05:33,615
We have to wake  up early.

497
01:05:35,075 --> 01:05:37,307
Fuck, I'll  just send Ivan the ...

498
01:05:37,808 --> 01:05:40,508
Let's get Ivan set, and
then you need to go to bed.

499
01:05:40,543 --> 01:05:43,186
I'm waking up with the ...Jesus.

500
01:05:59,017 --> 01:06:03,313
- I was about to make smoke signals.
- Bowl it straight, Bob.

501
01:06:03,772 --> 01:06:08,235
Well, now that aren't you
new anymore, aren't you?

502
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:12,448
- Why is there such back log?
- The nurse said no more incinerating.

503
01:06:12,573 --> 01:06:14,014
Cause it smell on the freeway.

504
01:06:14,715 --> 01:06:17,675
It's easier to sink 'em or bury 'em.
I don't wanna dig any hole.

505
01:06:17,704 --> 01:06:22,709
- Our girl Svetlana in that batch?
- Yeah. There you go.

506
01:06:27,088 --> 01:06:31,051
Well there are going to be
wall eyes in that lake today.

507
01:06:43,022 --> 01:06:46,318
I'm saying no on this internet thing.

508
01:06:46,443 --> 01:06:50,864
This business is not meant
be glorified with technology.

509
01:06:50,989 --> 01:06:57,246
All of you doing it.  Chumming a line
for some lab freak to trace the source.

510
01:06:59,332 --> 01:07:03,186
- What the hell is the matter with you?
- What?

511
01:07:03,311 --> 01:07:08,926
Try to relax. Jesus Christ,
you're making me nervous.

512
01:07:10,802 --> 01:07:15,431
So uhh ... How is this...
How's the investigation going?

513
01:07:15,556 --> 01:07:19,263
I mean, I heard about it, that's all.
Is it like? You know, I mean. I don’t know

514
01:07:19,264 --> 01:07:21,148
Do you think I want
to talk about that?

515
01:07:22,022 --> 01:07:26,986
Vaughan is bit socially retarded
because he had Mennonite foster parents.

516
01:07:27,111 --> 01:07:30,323
Religious fanatics.

517
01:07:30,572 --> 01:07:34,327
- Do you know what a Bible marker is?
- Bob...

518
01:07:34,351 --> 01:07:37,448
Uh, he used him to mark
passages and what not ..

519
01:07:37,449 --> 01:07:39,587
they have a little
proverbs written on him.

520
01:07:40,042 --> 01:07:44,421
Vaughan never got anything to
play with, besides these markers.

521
01:07:44,546 --> 01:07:50,194
and the thing is, he didn't learn how
to read till he was like 16.  Was it 16?

522
01:07:51,846 --> 01:07:55,307
You can go either way with
that kind of pious upbringing.

523
01:07:55,433 --> 01:08:00,272
But Vaughan's primal notions
were not cut out for sanctity.

524
01:08:00,396 --> 01:08:06,728
I guess, if you are born by sin
... you live by sin.

525
01:08:09,072 --> 01:08:13,326
Army took him though.
The army is like a pimp.

526
01:08:13,452 --> 01:08:17,039
Take anyone with a pulse
... break him in like a steed.

527
01:08:17,165 --> 01:08:20,001
Okay, Bob.
That's enough. Yeah.

528
01:08:20,126 --> 01:08:21,242
I give up.

529
01:08:21,243 --> 01:08:26,841
Every time I tried train this kid
afford his emotions, it flat out fail.

530
01:08:26,876 --> 01:08:32,181
It's like trying to teach colors to the
blind.  I'm trying to help you my boy.

531
01:08:32,306 --> 01:08:38,304
Believe me, you'd be better for it
when I leave this behind me.

532
01:08:43,150 --> 01:08:45,777
Oops! Got one!

533
01:08:50,408 --> 01:08:52,310
Look at that little guy run.

534
01:08:53,111 --> 01:08:55,605
He won't be worth
the trouble to gut him.

535
01:08:55,607 --> 01:08:57,540
Shut the fuck up!

536
01:09:55,811 --> 01:09:57,442
That was order from the top.

537
01:09:57,743 --> 01:10:01,034
You can relax,
I'm not going to organize ....

538
01:10:29,179 --> 01:10:31,223
- Where do you go?
- Bathroom.

539
01:10:31,348 --> 01:10:35,562
- You go when I say you go.
- Come on, Ivan.

540
01:10:35,687 --> 01:10:40,742
Hey, you go when I say you go.

541
01:10:48,533 --> 01:10:50,945
Let's go. Field trip.

542
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:27,374
- Boss! Hey!
- What's up kid?

543
01:11:27,375 --> 01:11:28,481
Good, good.
You've been working out?

544
01:11:28,516 --> 01:11:31,245
Aw Shit! I don't need to, dog.

545
01:11:38,962 --> 01:11:43,175
-Hey. How many months?
- Looking fine though.

546
01:11:50,265 --> 01:11:52,619
What the fuck, come on man,
not on my dinner table.

547
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:55,522
Why not? Just chill the
fuck up, I'll be like a second.

548
01:11:55,939 --> 01:11:59,695
Uhmm, I've lost my torch.
You got a light?

549
01:12:00,096 --> 01:12:01,546
It's on the stove.

550
01:12:03,238 --> 01:12:07,025
You want to get it?
Thank you...

551
01:12:09,286 --> 01:12:11,819
- Stop talking to me in that fucking
- ... uhhh fuck!

552
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:13,520
- ...what the fuck you talking about?
- With your brains off?

553
01:12:14,221 --> 01:12:16,347
Holy shit.
You all right girl?

554
01:12:16,382 --> 01:12:18,547
- Yeah I'm good.
- Come here.

555
01:12:22,300 --> 01:12:23,885
There you go.

556
01:12:25,428 --> 01:12:29,941
Ah, come on now baby girl.
It'll be all right.

557
01:12:45,700 --> 01:12:49,954
- This one's new?
- About a year now. I picked her myself.

558
01:12:50,080 --> 01:12:52,658
Alright.

559
01:12:52,693 --> 01:12:54,375
Hey.
Can I use your bathroom?

560
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,613
Yeah. Yeah, it's down
the hall to the right.

561
01:12:57,914 --> 01:13:00,867
Hey baby girl, can do me a favor?

562
01:13:01,216 --> 01:13:05,863
Can you, hide the shampoo in there so this
motherfucker doesn't use it to jerk off.

563
01:13:05,887 --> 01:13:09,200
<i>Oh my god!
Shut the fuck up.</i>

564
01:14:05,285 --> 01:14:06,816
Did it happen to you, too?

565
01:14:06,817 --> 01:14:09,647
Shh...What are you talking about?
What are you doing here?

566
01:14:09,664 --> 01:14:11,934
They taking care of
me and my baby here.

567
01:14:12,635 --> 01:14:16,358
Oh, no, no, no, not taking care of you.
We mean to get you out of here.

568
01:14:16,393 --> 01:14:19,509
You look different.

569
01:14:19,883 --> 01:14:22,428
- Are you here with them?
- No.

570
01:14:22,553 --> 01:14:25,431
You are here with them!

571
01:14:26,015 --> 01:14:27,785
You're gonna be quiet.
They are in the next room,

572
01:14:27,786 --> 01:14:30,845
if they hear you they going
to kill me.   Just be quite.

573
01:14:59,759 --> 01:15:02,679
Eden!
Come in here.

574
01:15:03,555 --> 01:15:04,823
Bob's on TV!

575
01:15:04,824 --> 01:15:08,035
.. missing Federal Marshall Robert Gault
has been officially called off.

576
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:09,647
Gault's family ...

577
01:15:09,682 --> 01:15:12,648
- Aww. Look how pretty he looks.
- Shut the fuck! I wanna listen to this.

578
01:15:12,773 --> 01:15:13,451
Hey Bobbard !....

579
01:15:13,452 --> 01:15:17,807
... Gault was the son of a test pilot.
He joined the army in 1977.

580
01:15:20,264 --> 01:15:23,868
- Shut the fuck up! I want to listen.
- Take it easy then, tough guy.

581
01:15:23,903 --> 01:15:26,371
He became Federal Marshall in 1985.

582
01:15:26,496 --> 01:15:30,834
Specializing in certain seizure
of contraband and illicit drugs.

583
01:15:30,960 --> 01:15:36,882
He will remembered as a husband, father,
an asset to his community and nation.

584
01:15:37,108 --> 01:15:38,776
Bullshit!

585
01:16:05,455 --> 01:16:07,278
- Pull over.
- What?

586
01:16:07,279 --> 01:16:10,200
- Get off the fucking road!
- Where?

587
01:16:10,201 --> 01:16:13,256
Right here!
Just pull over! Turn! Turn!

588
01:16:17,884 --> 01:16:19,678
Keep going.

589
01:16:22,848 --> 01:16:25,976
Right.  Pull in here.
Stop.

590
01:16:32,191 --> 01:16:35,820
Tell me what you saw in the house.

591
01:16:38,615 --> 01:16:44,704
- A room that look like a hospital.
- Do you know what it's for?

592
01:16:50,503 --> 01:16:55,174
- Selling babies.
- Wow! Really? Say that again.

593
01:16:55,299 --> 01:16:57,968
- Why?
- Say it again!

594
01:16:58,928 --> 01:17:01,180
Selling babies.

595
01:17:01,455 --> 01:17:04,643
That doesn't make you sick?

596
01:17:04,768 --> 01:17:07,665
I mean the time I first saw that I
think that place is a good place for you,

597
01:17:07,666 --> 01:17:09,422
you’re cool with it,
it means nothing to you.

598
01:17:09,689 --> 01:17:11,517
- Come on, Vaughan.
- Come on what?

599
01:17:11,518 --> 01:17:12,594
Just go.

600
01:17:13,318 --> 01:17:16,008
- Are you in it?
- What do you think?

601
01:17:16,009 --> 01:17:18,071
I'm asking if you are
actually committed to this?

602
01:17:19,116 --> 01:17:25,456
Because you do not want to come
this far and then just ... betray me.

603
01:17:29,085 --> 01:17:30,942
Why would I betray you?

604
01:17:31,443 --> 01:17:34,997
It's not why. I've got
that figured out. It's how.

605
01:17:40,764 --> 01:17:43,392
Shut the fuck up!

606
01:17:45,770 --> 01:17:47,826
What would you want me to do?

607
01:17:55,572 --> 01:17:59,909
I want everyone out
of the van.  Out of the van.

608
01:18:03,204 --> 01:18:06,375
Out!  Eden, get out.
I want you to see this.

609
01:18:06,500 --> 01:18:09,082
Get out of the van before
I drag you up by your feet.

610
01:18:09,083 --> 01:18:10,375
You don't want me to do that.

611
01:18:11,255 --> 01:18:14,499
Come on. Alright. Come on. Hop out
of the van and hop down on your knees.

612
01:18:14,700 --> 01:18:17,000
Face the fucking road.

613
01:18:17,001 --> 01:18:18,005
What are you gonna do?
Shoot her?

614
01:18:18,006 --> 01:18:20,632
No.
You are. Take it.

615
01:18:20,667 --> 01:18:21,683
No.

616
01:18:21,850 --> 01:18:22,716
Fucking cunt.

617
01:18:22,717 --> 01:18:24,581
Put it to the back of her head.

618
01:18:24,582 --> 01:18:27,321
She won't feel anything if you
put it in the back of her head.

619
01:18:27,356 --> 01:18:30,266
Painless.
Humane.

620
01:18:37,575 --> 01:18:39,827
Shoot her.

621
01:18:47,043 --> 01:18:50,472
If it's not her, it will be you.

622
01:19:12,654 --> 01:19:15,531
Oh my god, come here.
Come here.

623
01:19:15,865 --> 01:19:22,122
I can't believe that you actually
going to do it, ha ha.  Crazy girl.

624
01:19:24,958 --> 01:19:28,962
You wanna get some food?
You hungry? Huh?

625
01:19:32,592 --> 01:19:35,260
Let's get something to eat.
Come on.

626
01:19:35,386 --> 01:19:39,926
All right. It's okay.
Hey I was kidding.

627
01:19:39,927 --> 01:19:43,520
Do you know what kidding means?
Get back in the van.

628
01:20:11,925 --> 01:20:14,652
- Hello?
- Vaughan?
- Yeah?

629
01:20:14,653 --> 01:20:17,578
Where are you?
You need to come to the stables.

630
01:20:17,579 --> 01:20:19,938
Yeah I know.
We are on the way back right now.

631
01:20:20,017 --> 01:20:24,443
We got orders to pack. Ivan talked.
You're suppose to take care of him.

632
01:20:24,544 --> 01:20:27,513
- I'm getting the girls who need to go.
- Okay.

633
01:20:50,424 --> 01:20:52,844
Ivan, you're still alive?

634
01:20:52,969 --> 01:20:55,494
Avni, I thought I told you
to bash this traitor's colon.

635
01:20:55,495 --> 01:20:58,373
I mean I could do it.  Do you
want me to fucking do your job?

636
01:21:05,690 --> 01:21:06,941
Come on.

637
01:21:22,626 --> 01:21:24,669
So what's going on?

638
01:21:28,256 --> 01:21:31,259
- We're moving.
- Where?

639
01:21:32,385 --> 01:21:37,098
We'll find out.
Smoke some of these boxes.

640
01:21:39,143 --> 01:21:41,646
It's dirty.

641
01:21:56,995 --> 01:22:00,375
There is no time to
get sentimental, Eden.

642
01:22:00,499 --> 01:22:04,253
Come on let's take
them out of the fire.

643
01:22:37,080 --> 01:22:42,708
Do you remember when we sent Ivan
on that solo run back in Christmas?

644
01:22:42,709 --> 01:22:43,809
 I think that's when he got pinched.

645
01:22:44,263 --> 01:22:48,442
He's using one of wires since
January, that motherfucker.

646
01:22:48,967 --> 01:22:53,638
I mean, I was thinking Bob is fucking
lucky that we got him when we got to him.

647
01:22:53,764 --> 01:22:55,662
Because he would have been
out of that as the asshole

648
01:22:55,663 --> 01:23:00,553
 and not a fucking hero that everybody
was in love with and crying over.

649
01:23:01,105 --> 01:23:05,052
Hey, you go over this passports
and pick one that looks like you.

650
01:23:05,276 --> 01:23:09,413
- Where are we going?
- What? We're going to Dubai.

651
01:24:13,474 --> 01:24:18,312
- Are you nervous about going to Dubai?
- Yeah.

652
01:24:18,605 --> 01:24:21,115
Cause you're not going to be
doing any trick while we're out there.

653
01:24:21,116 --> 01:24:25,953
I mean it's you and me.
I want you to know that.

654
01:24:27,906 --> 01:24:31,402
We know the day to day fucking bullshit
that it takes around this organization.

655
01:24:31,403 --> 01:24:33,275
We can easily take it over.

656
01:24:33,788 --> 01:24:37,983
- And we're partners, right?
- Right.

657
01:25:08,658 --> 01:25:13,654
Can you give me water?
I need some fucking water.

658
01:27:37,107 --> 01:27:39,610
Can I come in?

659
01:27:47,994 --> 01:27:50,037
Sit down.

660
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:04,720
- I wanna buy Priscilla.
- How much you got?

661
01:28:09,099 --> 01:28:11,436
That's not enough.

662
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:19,652
Is there anything else I
can do besides paying you?

663
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:28,429
You know I remember you.
I mean when you first came here.

664
01:28:28,537 --> 01:28:34,761
- I know. Do you remember me?
- No.

665
01:28:42,135 --> 01:28:45,221
- Can I at least see her?
- Why you wanna do that?

666
01:28:45,246 --> 01:28:46,506
You can take the all the money.

667
01:28:46,507 --> 01:28:50,886
Ow. You're giving me
permission? Gee, thanks.

668
01:28:56,692 --> 01:28:58,965
Hey, you know how they
can tell this ain't fake?

669
01:28:58,966 --> 01:29:03,025
It's the ink.
It doesn't smudge.

670
01:29:04,033 --> 01:29:06,732
See. Look at that. See?

671
01:29:07,770 --> 01:29:13,251
Ah, they don't check that shit anyway.
It's not like it's a hundred dollar bill.

672
01:29:13,376 --> 01:29:16,171
It's just a fucking person.

673
01:29:21,093 --> 01:29:24,240
Alright, you could see her
for 5 minutes, then you got to go.

674
01:29:24,265 --> 01:29:30,685
- Okay.
- Empty your pockets.

675
01:29:39,820 --> 01:29:42,074
Let's go.

676
01:30:16,318 --> 01:30:17,616
Hey. Hey Priscilla.
We got to go!

677
01:30:17,617 --> 01:30:20,694
We got to go right now.
Wake up, we got to go.

678
01:30:20,906 --> 01:30:22,627
I can't.
My baby is here.

679
01:30:22,628 --> 01:30:24,747
No, your baby isn't here.
We got to go.

680
01:30:24,782 --> 01:30:27,371
- Where is she?
- I don't know. They took her.

681
01:30:27,497 --> 01:30:30,904
You took her!
El ruisenor! You took her.

682
01:30:30,905 --> 01:30:32,598
Come on. Trust me.
We got to go right now.

683
01:30:32,878 --> 01:30:35,415
Ok, listen to me, ok.
I didn't take your baby.

684
01:30:35,416 --> 01:30:38,551
Mario sold your baby. I'm sorry.

685
01:30:39,134 --> 01:30:43,472
I'll explain to you later, but
we gotta go right now, ok?

686
01:30:58,029 --> 01:31:00,453
I'm so sorry I didn't get here sooner.

687
01:31:07,956 --> 01:31:11,035
We gotta go.
We got to go, come on.

688
01:31:12,837 --> 01:31:15,456
Just trust me, okay.

689
01:31:21,263 --> 01:31:23,514
Come on. Don't look.

690
01:32:29,167 --> 01:32:30,753
Hello?

691
01:32:34,841 --> 01:32:36,426
Hello?

692
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:39,847
Oma.

693
01:32:40,861 --> 01:32:42,283
Hyun Jae.

694
01:32:43,827 --> 01:32:45,423
Is it you?

695
01:32:46,159 --> 01:32:47,134
Hyun Jae.
