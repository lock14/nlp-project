1
00:00:54,087 --> 00:00:59,218
<i>1936, Jesse Owens.
1960, Cassius Clay.</i>

2
00:00:59,292 --> 00:01:02,261
<i>And now in 1988,
the name on everyone's lips,</i>

3
00:01:02,328 --> 00:01:05,695
<i>US table tennis champion,
Randy Daytona.</i>

4
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:09,861
<i>You've seen him in Sports Illustrated,
on the Cinnamon Toast Crunch box.</i>

5
00:01:09,936 --> 00:01:13,667
<i>You may even already own his
McDonald's collector's glass.</i>

6
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:17,073
<i>The golden boy
who iced Iceland in round one,</i>

7
00:01:17,143 --> 00:01:20,306
<i>and checked off Czechoslovakia
in round two.</i>

8
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:24,980
<i>So why don't we take a moment
to meet the real Randy Daytona?</i>

9
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:28,916
<i>Here he is showing us his skills
with his lucky Def Leppard paddle</i>

10
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,115
<i>that's won him
over 200 amateur matches.</i>

11
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:36,026
<i>With him, as always, his coach and father,
Sergeant Pete Daytona, of the US Marines.</i>

12
00:01:36,496 --> 00:01:39,260
<i>Randy, you're only 12 years
old, and already they're saying</i>

13
00:01:39,332 --> 00:01:40,731
<i>that your name
will go down among those</i>

14
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:44,531
<i>of the greatest Ping-Pong
players ever to take up the sport.</i>

15
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,198
<i>And right offhand, I don't
know what those names are.</i>

16
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:51,903
<i>Randy, the eyes of all America,
and indeed the entire world,</i>

17
00:01:51,978 --> 00:01:53,445
<i>will be on you tonight.</i>

18
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,481
USA! USA! USA!

19
00:01:55,548 --> 00:01:57,778
<i>45 am. The moment
you've all been waiting for.</i>

20
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,012
<i>The men's table tennis
semifinals.</i>

21
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:02,782
<i>Tiny balls, bouncing for gold.</i>

22
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:04,380
USA! USA! USA!

23
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:08,553
<i>Now, presenting
the United States of America,</i>

24
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:10,391
<i>Randy Daytona!</i>

25
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:11,589
<i>Here he is,</i>

26
00:02:11,664 --> 00:02:14,827
<i>entering to his unofficial
theme song, Rock of Ages,</i>

27
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:17,096
<i>by the super group
Def Leppard.</i>

28
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:19,468
I love you, Randy!

29
00:02:22,442 --> 00:02:24,774
Hey, big guy, I just want
to make sure you're ready.

30
00:02:24,844 --> 00:02:25,868
Have you seen my dad?

31
00:02:25,945 --> 00:02:26,934
No.

32
00:02:30,783 --> 00:02:31,772
Where were you?

33
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:33,842
<i>You think I'd miss this?</i>

34
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:42,494
<i>You didn't put money on this,
did you?</i>

35
00:02:42,562 --> 00:02:44,291
Dad, you promised.

36
00:02:44,364 --> 00:02:45,854
Try not to think about it,
okay?

37
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:48,457
<i>Now, presenting East Germany,</i>

38
00:02:48,535 --> 00:02:51,163
<i>Karl Wolfschtagg!</i>

39
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:59,171
Deutschland! Deutschland!
Deutschland! Deutschland!

40
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:16,753
May the best man win, huh?

41
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:21,765
I will destroy him!

42
00:03:21,834 --> 00:03:23,597
Beat that Kraut!

43
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:43,986
<i>Breathtaking intensity
surrounds the table</i>

44
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:47,515
<i>as Daytona and Manslaughter
fire away at each other.</i>

45
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:51,864
<i>Daytona's in the groove.</i>

46
00:03:54,534 --> 00:03:57,833
<i>Both men distancing themselves
from the table now.</i>

47
00:03:57,904 --> 00:04:00,930
<i>There's a high elevation lob.
Tremendous accuracy.</i>

48
00:04:01,007 --> 00:04:04,773
<i>And a smash by Manslaughter.
And Randy Daytona makes the save.</i>

49
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:14,783
<i>One more smash!
And now Daytona goes back.</i>

50
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:18,548
<i>Farther back!</i>

51
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,519
<i>Back!</i>

52
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:25,330
<i>And the crowd rises
in anticipation!</i>

53
00:04:25,398 --> 00:04:26,695
<i>He stretches.</i>

54
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,994
Look out!

55
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:29,957
<i>Shit!</i>

56
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,302
Randy? Randy? You okay?

57
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:38,310
Randy? Randy?

58
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:42,076
<i>Randy Daytona,
unable to finish.</i>

59
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:45,311
<i>Match forfeit to East Germany.</i>

60
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,285
Randy?

61
00:04:54,894 --> 00:04:56,862
<i>I'm going to Disneyland!</i>

62
00:05:08,007 --> 00:05:10,874
<i>Come on, guys.
Can't we talk about this?</i>

63
00:05:10,943 --> 00:05:13,309
Mr. Feng does not
extend credit.

64
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,614
Gentlemen, time is money.

65
00:05:19,686 --> 00:05:21,017
Chop-chop.

66
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:23,815
Jesus!

67
00:05:25,758 --> 00:05:28,192
<i>Well, that's the way the
cookie crumbles here in Korea.</i>

68
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:31,128
<i>As Reno's golden boy was
humiliated in the semifinals,</i>

69
00:05:31,197 --> 00:05:35,156
<i>and if he lives to be 100, he'll
never live down that Disneyland line.</i>

70
00:05:35,234 --> 00:05:38,362
<i>If he returns to America,
a life of shame.</i>

71
00:05:42,809 --> 00:05:45,369
<i>Two tickets to paradise!</i>

72
00:05:45,445 --> 00:05:49,211
<i>Won't you pack your bags?
We'll leave tonight</i>

73
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:53,413
<i>I got...
Two tickets to paradise!</i>

74
00:05:54,187 --> 00:06:00,387
<i>I got...
Two tickets to paradise!</i>

75
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,825
<i>Let's go to heaven</i>

76
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,767
<i>Yeah! Thank you!</i>

77
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:10,632
<i>Take a bow, honey.</i>

78
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,136
<i>There she is!</i>

79
00:06:12,205 --> 00:06:15,231
<i>All right, let's keep the love
going for our very next act,</i>

80
00:06:15,308 --> 00:06:19,074
<i>The Peppermill's
very own Ping-Pong wizard...</i>

81
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:21,443
<i>Randy Daytona!
Randy Daytona!</i>

82
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:24,244
<i>Come on, let's bring him out.</i>

83
00:06:28,788 --> 00:06:31,484
<i>How's everybody feeling
this afternoon?</i>

84
00:06:36,996 --> 00:06:39,191
All right!

85
00:06:58,985 --> 00:07:00,782
<i>I don't want to work.</i>

86
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,681
I just want to bang on these
drums all day long. Am I right?

87
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,494
Hey!

88
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:18,301
Thank you!

89
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:25,433
Hey, a volunteer!
How you doing, buddy?

90
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:28,241
<i>I was just going
for more Cheese 'n Mac.</i>

91
00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:32,910
Stop!

92
00:07:35,922 --> 00:07:37,253
Thank you!

93
00:07:41,961 --> 00:07:44,555
We're in the biz

94
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:49,260
to bring the bewonderment of
live theater to these people,

95
00:07:49,335 --> 00:07:53,795
so they will stay for the
loosest slots on The Strip.

96
00:07:53,873 --> 00:07:57,832
Not to give them
a heart attack, Randy!

97
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:00,845
Sorry, Rick.
It will never happen again.

98
00:08:00,913 --> 00:08:03,541
I know because you're fired.

99
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,476
Get your stink out
of my theater.

100
00:08:11,491 --> 00:08:13,550
Sorry, Randy.

101
00:08:13,626 --> 00:08:16,459
But some agent
was looking for you backstage.

102
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:18,520
Maybe he missed the show.

103
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,436
Thank you, Bethany.

104
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,397
<i>My name's Sarah.</i>

105
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:28,836
Are you kidding me?
Uh-uh.

106
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:33,206
<i>You've called me Bethany for
the past five years. It's fine.</i>

107
00:08:35,815 --> 00:08:37,612
Mr. Daytona?
Yeah.

108
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,548
Ernie Rodriguez, FBI.

109
00:08:39,619 --> 00:08:42,486
<i>Oh, God! I didn't mean
to hurt that guy!</i>

110
00:08:42,555 --> 00:08:44,147
How could I know that
he had a bad heart?

111
00:08:44,223 --> 00:08:45,781
<i>That's not why I'm here.</i>

112
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,294
Hey, actually, I thought
that was part of the show.

113
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:52,695
Till the paramedics showed up,
I was laughing my ass off.

114
00:08:52,765 --> 00:08:53,789
Well, am I in
some kind of trouble or...

115
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:54,890
No.

116
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,366
I came to ask you
for your help.

117
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:59,768
The FBI needs you to take part
in a top-secret mission.

118
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:02,239
One that calls for a man
of your unique skills.

119
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,115
<i>I'm not joking, man.
I'm FBI. I swear.</i>

120
00:09:11,183 --> 00:09:13,845
Come on, man. You got a
hidden camera on you, right?

121
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,219
Cut it out.
You're not allowed to do that.

122
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,314
Fake gun and everything.

123
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:26,256
<i>Now why don't you put on
some big boy pants</i>

124
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,027
and we'll go for a ride.

125
00:09:32,038 --> 00:09:33,869
The man with the umbrella
is our target.

126
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:36,340
I think you'll want
to help us catch him, Randy.

127
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,876
His name is Mr. Feng.

128
00:09:37,944 --> 00:09:39,571
Mr. Feng?

129
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,111
<i>That's the guy
that killed my father.</i>

130
00:09:42,181 --> 00:09:43,876
I know.

131
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:46,043
His face
has never been photographed.

132
00:09:46,118 --> 00:09:49,986
This sketch is based on the
description by a late agent of the ATF.

133
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,024
Wait a minute,
this guy looks like...

134
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:55,822
<i>George Takei? Mr. Sulu? I know.
It's not, though. We checked him out.</i>

135
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:58,090
<i>We have reason to believe
he's about to make</i>

136
00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:00,496
some kind of a major shipment
into the US.

137
00:10:00,566 --> 00:10:03,535
And what, man? What do
you want me to do about it?

138
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,036
What you were born to do.

139
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,572
You see, Randy,
Feng is a Ping-Pong fanatic.

140
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,904
He played for the Chinese
when he was a kid.

141
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,274
Now every five years
he brings the best to him.

142
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:14,711
A high-stakes tournament,
at a secret location.

143
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,179
Invitation only.

144
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:18,216
His men go to tournaments
all over the world,

145
00:10:18,284 --> 00:10:20,377
searching for
the best of the best.

146
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,048
<i>You see that gold paddle?
That's the invitation.</i>

147
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:27,388
You, Randy,
you're our ticket in.

148
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,189
<i>I'm not a spy, man.</i>

149
00:10:29,295 --> 00:10:31,286
<i>Look, you don't have to do
anything but play Ping-Pong, man.</i>

150
00:10:31,364 --> 00:10:33,059
You go to a few tournaments
and do your stuff.

151
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,360
If you're as good
as you used to be,

152
00:10:34,433 --> 00:10:36,264
<i>I'm sure
you'll get an invitation.</i>

153
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:38,428
<i>Look, this year Feng's
invited a who's who</i>

154
00:10:38,504 --> 00:10:40,335
of the international
most wanted list.

155
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,169
<i>Randy, something big's
going down.</i>

156
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:45,176
<i>Here's the thing.
You're bananas.</i>

157
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:49,203
I do matinee shows. I get
introduced by a cockatoo.

158
00:10:49,281 --> 00:10:51,613
Mr. Daytona, you're the only
one who can lead us to Feng.

159
00:10:51,684 --> 00:10:52,810
I've been authorized
to offer you

160
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:55,319
<i>anything in the government's
power if you help us out.</i>

161
00:10:55,388 --> 00:10:59,290
<i>You don't get it, do you, man?
I don't compete anymore!</i>

162
00:10:59,358 --> 00:11:00,689
Okay?

163
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,785
Maybe I never should have.

164
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:18,137
Caucasians.

165
00:11:18,878 --> 00:11:22,644
<i>Hey, Dad. I'm sorry I
haven't been around in awhile.</i>

166
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,514
<i>And again, I'm sorry about abbreviating
your dates on the headstone.</i>

167
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:34,388
The numbers were, like, 100 bucks a
pop, and apostrophes were free so...

168
00:11:47,106 --> 00:11:48,573
Excuse me?

169
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:50,131
Excuse me!

170
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:53,007
<i>The new slide's
a little close, isn't it?</i>

171
00:11:53,079 --> 00:11:57,209
What are you gonna do? They sold
the air rights to the cemetery.

172
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,774
They sold the air rights
to a cemetery?

173
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:03,379
<i>It's a pretty okay water slide,
though. It's called Eerie Canals.</i>

174
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:08,450
<i>I guess it's a theme
that it's haunted. Something.</i>

175
00:12:08,527 --> 00:12:09,824
Look out!

176
00:12:15,868 --> 00:12:17,665
<i>All right. I'm in.</i>

177
00:12:57,543 --> 00:12:58,908
I love that smell.

178
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,071
Good to be back
on the circuit again, huh?

179
00:13:03,215 --> 00:13:05,376
I meant pancakes.

180
00:13:05,451 --> 00:13:07,510
I love the smell of pancakes.

181
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,780
Okay, you're not here
to have fun.

182
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:10,845
All right? You're here to win.
Get your head in the game.

183
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:12,550
What, do you think Feng
is gonna have scouts here?

184
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,718
No, but you got to win here
to get to State.

185
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,853
You are gonna win, right?

186
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,056
I can take these punks.

187
00:13:19,131 --> 00:13:22,066
<i>All right, first up
we have Andy...</i>

188
00:13:23,502 --> 00:13:25,993
<i>Randy Daytona</i>

189
00:13:26,105 --> 00:13:30,838
<i>versus our four-time
Western Conference Champion,</i>

190
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,844
<i>The Hammer.</i>

191
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:01,005
<i>I don't know what the hell
he's talking about.</i>

192
00:14:01,073 --> 00:14:03,405
<i>I'm still trying to figure out
if it's a dude or a chick.</i>

193
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,516
No mercy, Randy.

194
00:14:41,247 --> 00:14:43,875
Have your grandma
pull the car around.

195
00:14:57,496 --> 00:15:00,795
Can you dig it?

196
00:15:09,008 --> 00:15:10,942
Tastes good.

197
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,479
11 to 3!

198
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,251
<i>I told you I was rusty. I
haven't competed in 19 years.</i>

199
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,412
<i>Why don't you cut me
some slack, man?</i>

200
00:15:22,488 --> 00:15:23,978
I need some time to warm up.

201
00:15:24,056 --> 00:15:27,389
<i>Time we don't have. Feng's
tournament's in two weeks.</i>

202
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:29,757
Man, I got to get you
in shape.

203
00:15:34,867 --> 00:15:36,232
We're here.

204
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:40,600
<i>The world's greatest Ping-Pong
instructor owns a takeout restaurant?</i>

205
00:15:40,673 --> 00:15:43,073
<i>Don't hate.
The school's upstairs.</i>

206
00:15:46,078 --> 00:15:49,047
<i>This guy's blind,
so let me do the talking.</i>

207
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,344
<i>Wong won't train just anybody.</i>

208
00:15:51,984 --> 00:15:53,849
<i>And he never trains gweilo.</i>

209
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:55,614
<i>Who?
Gweilo.</i>

210
00:15:55,688 --> 00:15:58,748
<i>It means "round eye. "
Gringo. You, man.</i>

211
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:00,917
He only takes
Chinese students.

212
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,594
Damn, bro.

213
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:07,492
Hey...

214
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:14,898
You okay, dude?

215
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:16,236
Get out!

216
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:18,503
<i>Get out.
I don't teach gweilo.</i>

217
00:16:19,745 --> 00:16:22,213
<i>How did you know that
we were gweilo?</i>

218
00:16:22,281 --> 00:16:26,877
Same way that I can tell
you are 30 years old.

219
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:28,613
Too old to start training.

220
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,213
Pudgy.

221
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,588
You are filled
with self-doubt.

222
00:16:35,594 --> 00:16:37,789
And you use Lady Speed Stick.

223
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,457
It was on sale.

224
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:49,669
Feng was my most gifted pupil.

225
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:54,512
He played table tennis like
the devil in short shorts.

226
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,372
But he had expensive taste.

227
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,685
He began to steal and extort.

228
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:04,450
Turning my school of table
tennis into a den of thieves.

229
00:17:05,758 --> 00:17:09,023
And when I cast him out,
he joined the Triad.

230
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:11,426
He lured my brother Le Ping
in with him.

231
00:17:11,497 --> 00:17:14,660
And when Le Ping tried
to go straight, he killed him.

232
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,531
<i>Le Ping's daughter
was left fatherless.</i>

233
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:20,333
If you help Randy and me
get to Feng's, we'll nail him.

234
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,873
I give you my word.

235
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,809
I will help you,
secret agent man.

236
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,575
You will start training
tomorrow, Randy.

237
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:33,175
Bring only your strength, your
honor and a check for $300.

238
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,345
Hey, secret agent man.

239
00:17:35,421 --> 00:17:37,821
I tell you something
right now, the truth.

240
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:41,951
Your boy will not pull it off.
We need a natural.

241
00:17:42,027 --> 00:17:44,860
Something I can work with.
You know what I mean.

242
00:17:52,704 --> 00:17:54,433
Dude!
What?

243
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:55,996
What did I miss?

244
00:18:00,679 --> 00:18:05,343
<i>Well, if it isn't
the infamous Randy Daytona.</i>

245
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:09,114
How was Disneyland?
Did you meet Dumbo?

246
00:18:09,188 --> 00:18:11,520
Is it always this crowded?

247
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,751
<i>Only when I'm not teaching.</i>

248
00:18:17,129 --> 00:18:20,155
<i>That's my niece,
Maggie Wong Mei Fei.</i>

249
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:24,969
She brings her father,
Le Ping, great honor.

250
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:32,809
<i>Wong's Mu Shu Palace,
how can I help you?</i>

251
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,283
She will be the one
who will be giving you

252
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:44,413
hands-on training.

253
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:47,015
<i>Gives "wax off"
a whole new meaning.</i>

254
00:18:50,062 --> 00:18:54,658
<i>Rule one, gweilo.
No touching my niece.</i>

255
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:55,722
Understand?

256
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,200
Yeah, I understand.

257
00:19:15,354 --> 00:19:16,446
What?

258
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,213
Table jockey.

259
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:51,085
Let them work it out, man.
Let them work it out.

260
00:20:17,282 --> 00:20:18,749
What does she weigh?
Like, 40 pounds?

261
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:28,857
Come on, man.
They're gonna kick your ass!

262
00:20:36,668 --> 00:20:38,465
Who wants to... Oh.

263
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:49,972
Maggie!

264
00:20:50,048 --> 00:20:53,745
Your temper brings dishonor
to my Happy Mu Shu Palace.

265
00:20:58,023 --> 00:20:59,320
You'll be sorry, Wong!

266
00:20:59,391 --> 00:21:02,952
<i>And teaching gweilo
is forbidden. You know that!</i>

267
00:21:03,028 --> 00:21:04,655
I'll tell the elders.

268
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,097
You will have
to face the Dragon.

269
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:13,194
Let me tell you
what you can tell the Dragon.

270
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,920
<i>Now, gweilo, we begin.</i>

271
00:21:34,593 --> 00:21:38,222
Ping-Pong is not
the Macarena.

272
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:42,233
It takes patience.

273
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:46,670
She is like a fine,
well-aged prostitute.

274
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:50,139
It takes years
to learn her tricks.

275
00:21:54,379 --> 00:21:56,370
She is cruel.

276
00:21:56,448 --> 00:21:58,609
Laughs at you
when you are naked.

277
00:22:00,285 --> 00:22:03,721
But you keep coming back
for more and more.

278
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:04,983
Why?

279
00:22:05,057 --> 00:22:08,356
Because she is the
only prostitute I can afford.

280
00:22:10,062 --> 00:22:12,496
<i>Gweilo, give me your paddle.</i>

281
00:22:12,564 --> 00:22:14,259
Here.

282
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:20,033
Now, for the time being,
you will practice with this.

283
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,965
What, are you crazy?

284
00:22:23,041 --> 00:22:25,874
<i>It's impossible, man.
Nobody can do that.</i>

285
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:29,075
That was nice.

286
00:22:29,147 --> 00:22:30,375
All right.

287
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,313
Come on.

288
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,212
One more time.

289
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:45,624
Come on.

290
00:22:55,173 --> 00:22:56,299
Do I have to eat that?

291
00:22:56,375 --> 00:22:59,811
To strengthen the body
and not the mind

292
00:22:59,911 --> 00:23:02,709
is to build a temple
on shifting sand.

293
00:23:04,349 --> 00:23:06,977
In my hand I hold a cricket.

294
00:23:09,421 --> 00:23:12,390
<i>What'd you do that for? Don't
take the cricket from my hand.</i>

295
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:14,948
<i>Who the hell said, "Take
the cricket from my hand"?</i>

296
00:23:15,026 --> 00:23:16,926
I just...
Put it back.

297
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:21,265
That is my lucky cricket.

298
00:23:23,568 --> 00:23:24,592
Oh.

299
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:29,634
Well, he just...
He flew out of my hand, man.

300
00:23:31,109 --> 00:23:32,542
You squished him?

301
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:33,976
No.

302
00:23:34,045 --> 00:23:35,410
You squished lucky cricket?

303
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,469
No.

304
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:40,814
Thanks a lot, kid!

305
00:23:44,689 --> 00:23:50,389
So, Maggie, what do you
do when you're not here?

306
00:23:50,462 --> 00:23:53,226
<i>So sorry,
don't speak English.</i>

307
00:23:56,668 --> 00:24:00,434
<i>But didn't I hear you speak
English on the phone yesterday?</i>

308
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:04,066
<i>No, you must be mistaken,
because I don't speak any English.</i>

309
00:24:04,142 --> 00:24:05,939
<i>I'm just trying
to get better acquainted.</i>

310
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:08,946
I know what you're trying
to get, table jockey.

311
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,948
For as long as I can remember,
guys have been in here

312
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:14,008
with their hands all over me,
with your stupid come-ons.

313
00:24:14,085 --> 00:24:16,349
<i>"Give me a hand
with my balls, Maggie. "</i>

314
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:17,615
Let me guess.

315
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:21,056
<i>You're not around girls much or you
probably wouldn't play Ping-Pong, right?</i>

316
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:23,117
Yeah, well, I thought that
your dad played Ping-Pong.

317
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:27,222
Do not compare yourself to my
father. My father was a great man.

318
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,994
<i>I'm not. It's just a game.</i>

319
00:24:29,067 --> 00:24:31,001
<i>It's not just a game!</i>

320
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:34,766
It is a proud tradition my family
have devoted their lives to!

321
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,671
You treat that tradition
like a joke.

322
00:24:36,741 --> 00:24:40,336
Uncle says you have no honor.
I say you have no shot.

323
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:43,347
So turn off the charm,
table jockey.

324
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,148
Oh, God.

325
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:54,588
You need to build
wrist strength.

326
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:57,685
Eye-hand coordination.

327
00:24:57,762 --> 00:24:59,161
Endurance.

328
00:25:01,733 --> 00:25:03,758
Oh, come on!

329
00:25:03,835 --> 00:25:08,067
<i>You got me hitting balls with
spoons. I'm swatting flies, now?</i>

330
00:25:08,139 --> 00:25:11,108
You not hit flies.
You hit bees.

331
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:12,768
What?

332
00:25:14,412 --> 00:25:15,743
Come on!

333
00:25:18,049 --> 00:25:19,277
Oh, shit!

334
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:23,921
Oh, shit!

335
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,694
You are halfway
through your training.

336
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,961
Now comes the difficult part.

337
00:25:37,602 --> 00:25:39,092
The backhand.

338
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:55,850
You must believe in yourself
when no one else does.

339
00:25:57,188 --> 00:25:59,383
Like right now,
for instance.

340
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:04,687
What?

341
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:08,194
What do you mean
I hit the net?

342
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:09,859
Dad!

343
00:26:10,735 --> 00:26:12,225
Freeze!

344
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:14,432
Hands on your head!

345
00:26:18,176 --> 00:26:21,612
<i>Oh, that's right, man.
I'm in Chinatown.</i>

346
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:23,443
<i>I'm sorry, man.</i>

347
00:26:25,283 --> 00:26:28,116
Want to pop off a couple of
rounds? Always makes me feel better.

348
00:26:28,186 --> 00:26:29,676
Listen to me.

349
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:33,087
Are you a real,
fully-licensed FBI guy?

350
00:26:33,158 --> 00:26:35,752
<i>I'm serious, man.
I mean, why...</i>

351
00:26:35,827 --> 00:26:40,287
You know, why would a real FBI
guy take on a mission like this?

352
00:26:40,365 --> 00:26:43,630
Nobody else would be caught
dead on Operation Ping-Pong.

353
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:46,830
<i>All right, they don't expect
us to catch Feng.</i>

354
00:26:46,905 --> 00:26:49,032
They got 20 agents
working other angles, man.

355
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,870
<i>I'm the backup plan.</i>

356
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:56,774
Look, I joined the company
for action, man.

357
00:26:56,848 --> 00:27:00,045
You know, car chases,
hang-gliding, James Bond stuff.

358
00:27:00,118 --> 00:27:03,019
Drinking martinis,
saving girls from danger.

359
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:06,085
<i>I haven't gotten
to wear a tuxedo</i>

360
00:27:06,157 --> 00:27:08,819
<i>since my goddaughter Martha's
quinceanera, man.</i>

361
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:12,260
For the last five years,
I've been at a desk, typing.

362
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:16,493
<i>I'm up to 70 words a minute.</i>

363
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:20,264
Hello.

364
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,739
Maggie, is that you?

365
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,138
Slow down.

366
00:27:24,876 --> 00:27:26,070
Slow down in English.

367
00:27:43,395 --> 00:27:44,885
What happened?

368
00:27:47,966 --> 00:27:50,196
<i>"Teaching outsiders
is forbidden. "</i>

369
00:27:50,268 --> 00:27:52,828
We've defied the elders,
now they're shutting us down.

370
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:56,396
They have forbidden me to
teach in Chinatown, forever.

371
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:58,942
<i>Well, don't worry. The FBI's
gonna find out who did this.</i>

372
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,774
We know who did it.
It is written right there.

373
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:07,109
No, no, no, no. No FBI.

374
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:09,619
We will settle this
in our own way.

375
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:15,925
<i>Gweilo, only
you can restore our honor.</i>

376
00:28:15,994 --> 00:28:17,928
You must go to the elders.

377
00:28:17,996 --> 00:28:20,089
You must face the Dragon.

378
00:28:20,165 --> 00:28:21,723
Okay, well, time out.

379
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:24,598
<i>We don't have time for some
ancient Chinese pissing contest.</i>

380
00:28:24,669 --> 00:28:26,330
<i>Feng's match is coming up.</i>

381
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:29,066
<i>And if we want Feng's scouts
to see Randy win some trophies,</i>

382
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,836
we got to get him out
to some tournaments.

383
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:33,343
Foolish secret agent man.

384
00:28:33,411 --> 00:28:35,971
Real Ping-Pong
is not played for trophies.

385
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:40,040
It is played in the shadows,
in dark alleys and backrooms

386
00:28:40,118 --> 00:28:43,747
for hard cash
and cheap, ugly women.

387
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:49,352
<i>If gweilo beats the Dragon,
it will reach Feng's ears,</i>

388
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:50,894
I assure you.

389
00:28:59,938 --> 00:29:03,897
We're here.
The lair of the Dragon.

390
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:05,636
From here we go alone.

391
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,074
Good luck, kid.

392
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:12,582
Thanks, man.

393
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:22,915
Randy, wait.

394
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:24,325
Yeah?

395
00:29:24,395 --> 00:29:26,727
I want you to have this.

396
00:29:26,798 --> 00:29:27,787
It belonged to my father.

397
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,128
Whoa.

398
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:33,795
<i>Maggie, I can't take this.</i>

399
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,570
<i>He'd have wanted you
to have it.</i>

400
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:38,666
Take it, you are ready.

401
00:29:38,743 --> 00:29:40,938
It has defeated many enemies.

402
00:29:42,847 --> 00:29:45,008
Good luck, Randy.

403
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:46,277
Thanks.

404
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:52,419
<i>Come, gweilo.</i>

405
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:57,393
The Dragon is the most feared table
tennis player in all Chinatown.

406
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:21,144
Welcome to the underbelly
of Ping-Pong.

407
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:24,450
Where fortunes
are won and lost.

408
00:30:24,522 --> 00:30:28,390
<i>I'm exaggerating, of course,
but you get my point.</i>

409
00:30:28,459 --> 00:30:30,654
People bet on Ping-Pong here.

410
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,625
<i>So you think you're good,
huh, gweilo?</i>

411
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,932
Well, put money
where mouth is.

412
00:30:42,941 --> 00:30:45,409
$4. No pay, no play.

413
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:49,069
<i>Got change for $5?
That's all I got.</i>

414
00:31:12,136 --> 00:31:13,763
<i>This guy doesn't seem
so tough to me.</i>

415
00:31:13,838 --> 00:31:15,703
That is not the Dragon.

416
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:21,138
That is the Dragon.

417
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,554
<i>Gweilo,</i>

418
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:40,661
remember, you suck
when you are nervous.

419
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,024
Thanks, Master.

420
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:54,610
First player
to lead by 3, wins.

421
00:31:54,679 --> 00:31:56,340
<i>Gweilo loses,</i>

422
00:31:56,414 --> 00:32:00,646
Wong and his descendants are
banished from Chinatown forever.

423
00:32:00,718 --> 00:32:03,346
And by extension,
all of Orange County.

424
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:13,158
<i>Dragon says,
"This serve, no can defend. "</i>

425
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:16,598
No one has hit it back
in five years of table tennis.

426
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:35,576
<i>She say, "No fair.
She wasn't ready. "</i>

427
00:32:35,653 --> 00:32:38,952
<i>She say, "That wasn't real
no can defend serve.</i>

428
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:42,720
<i>"This next one,
this, no can defend. "</i>

429
00:32:45,830 --> 00:32:47,354
<i>"So watch out. "</i>

430
00:33:01,212 --> 00:33:02,736
She say,

431
00:33:02,814 --> 00:33:06,648
<i>"Maybe we need to take a break.
Get some fresh air. Cool off. "</i>

432
00:33:32,143 --> 00:33:33,508
Yes!

433
00:33:34,312 --> 00:33:35,779
I said, "Yes!"

434
00:33:37,648 --> 00:33:39,673
That is right!

435
00:33:40,785 --> 00:33:42,150
Am I right?

436
00:33:42,420 --> 00:33:44,251
Just say, "Yes. "

437
00:33:44,322 --> 00:33:45,414
Fine!

438
00:33:51,963 --> 00:33:53,294
Oh, jeez.

439
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:57,295
Come on, little kid.

440
00:33:57,935 --> 00:34:01,371
<i>Don't be so hard on yourself,
you know. You got mad skills.</i>

441
00:34:12,817 --> 00:34:15,149
I warn you guys,
I know tai chi.

442
00:34:37,475 --> 00:34:38,772
<i>Here's your money.</i>

443
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:43,704
<i>Unfortunately,
it's covered in snot.</i>

444
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:49,980
I knew you could do it, man!

445
00:34:50,054 --> 00:34:51,544
He won, right?

446
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,849
What the hell?

447
00:35:12,910 --> 00:35:14,309
Mr. Daytona.

448
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:19,682
<i>Your balls have been tempered
in the fury of hell's Dragon.</i>

449
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,720
Wow!

450
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:31,956
My master, Mr. Feng, would be
honored to have you at his tournament.

451
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:50,312
Which way is the freeway? I seem
to have gotten turned around.

452
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:51,813
Oh, yeah.

453
00:35:57,788 --> 00:35:58,982
I knew that.

454
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:00,045
Yeah.

455
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:04,428
Mr. Daytona, we'll see you
at the tournament.

456
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,165
What?
What am I missing?

457
00:36:12,236 --> 00:36:14,431
Oh, we got the golden paddle.

458
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:20,901
As you can see, the paddle
contains a riddle in Chinese.

459
00:36:31,322 --> 00:36:34,849
<i>"On the longest day, two
hands reach towards heaven.</i>

460
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:36,826
<i>"We enter the clouds. "</i>

461
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:39,859
Of course.

462
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:42,024
When both hands reach up
on what?

463
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:44,158
<i>A clock. That's noon.</i>

464
00:36:44,235 --> 00:36:46,965
Longest day.
Wednesday, nine letters.

465
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:49,199
<i>We enter the clouds,
that's got to be an airfield.</i>

466
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:52,071
Yeah, but which airfield? There
are a dozen in Orange County alone.

467
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:54,805
John Wayne Airport, maybe.
They got a private hangar there

468
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:58,838
owned by a Japanese corporation
goes by the name of Haiku Cargo.

469
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:00,946
Check this out.

470
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:04,385
<i>On the longest day. Yeah.
It's 5-7-5. That's a haiku.</i>

471
00:37:05,489 --> 00:37:06,751
<i>That's impressive.
Yeah.</i>

472
00:37:06,824 --> 00:37:08,485
<i>It's on the back of
the paddle here in English.</i>

473
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:09,992
Noon, Wednesday,
John Wayne Airport.

474
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:12,655
Each player can bring a
coach, a doctor, two carry-ons.

475
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,823
Goose, run them through
the hardware they'll need.

476
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,560
I have stripped
everything down for you.

477
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:19,398
This is your homing device,
this is the transmitter.

478
00:37:19,470 --> 00:37:23,099
<i>So you just plant it, flip the
switch and backup's on its way.</i>

479
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:25,199
<i>Don't screw this up,
Rodriguez.</i>

480
00:37:25,276 --> 00:37:28,973
Do not signal unless you have
proof of what Feng is up to.

481
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:31,776
<i>We don't want theories.
We want him caught red-handed,</i>

482
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:33,942
with hard evidence, so we
can put him away for good.

483
00:37:34,018 --> 00:37:35,042
Yes, sir.

484
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,518
So let me guess, fellows.

485
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:38,782
We're gonna stick this
in the heel of our shoe,

486
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:41,757
put it in a tube of
toothpaste, something like that?

487
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:44,886
I think we'll have to sneak
this in the old-fashioned way.

488
00:37:44,962 --> 00:37:47,157
<i>What's the old-fashioned way?</i>

489
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:15,181
God, slow down.

490
00:38:15,259 --> 00:38:17,284
We should go alone from here.

491
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:20,853
Good luck, secret agent man.
Take care of Uncle, okay?

492
00:38:20,931 --> 00:38:23,229
Uncle can take care
of himself.

493
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,463
Oh, man.

494
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:30,263
<i>What's the stick for, man?
Come on.</i>

495
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:37,671
Okay.

496
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:42,708
Never hug a man with a million
bucks worth of hardware up his crack.

497
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:44,448
<i>Sorry.
It's okay.</i>

498
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,520
Go ahead and kiss her already!

499
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,852
So embarrass...

500
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:04,135
<i>Come back, gweilo.</i>

501
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,250
Bye.

502
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:32,402
Nice plane.

503
00:39:34,105 --> 00:39:35,697
Team Daytona.

504
00:39:38,008 --> 00:39:39,771
This way, gentlemen.

505
00:39:48,919 --> 00:39:52,218
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
Where we going, Tijuana?

506
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,604
It is with great honor
that I present your host.

507
00:41:19,243 --> 00:41:22,144
The man
who sold the Dragon his fire,

508
00:41:22,213 --> 00:41:24,613
stole it back,

509
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:26,582
and sold it again
to the Crips.

510
00:41:26,650 --> 00:41:28,743
Give it up for Master Feng.

511
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,801
<i>How's my collar?</i>

512
00:41:56,113 --> 00:41:57,944
Man, we were
way off George Takei.

513
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:06,522
Okie-dokie artichokie.

514
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,923
First of all, I know getting
here was the commute from hell.

515
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:13,395
I have to be a smidge
off the beaten track here.

516
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:19,096
Now, Ping-Pong,
or, as the Chinese say,

517
00:42:19,169 --> 00:42:20,261
<i>"Ping-Pong,"</i>

518
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:24,899
sport of emperors
and bandits alike.

519
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:29,002
I have assembled today, for
your entertainment pleasure,

520
00:42:29,079 --> 00:42:33,812
the most talented table tennis
athletes from around the globe.

521
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:36,409
Legends, every one.

522
00:42:36,487 --> 00:42:38,955
<i>We have last year's
North American champion</i>

523
00:42:39,023 --> 00:42:41,651
and holder
of the Canadian cup,

524
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,023
Mr. Freddy "Fingers" Wilson.

525
00:42:46,964 --> 00:42:48,226
Represent.

526
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:52,395
Four-time Australian champion,
Mr. Wedge McDonald!

527
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:58,167
Cutie.

528
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:03,876
From Japan,
Mr. Yukito Nagasaki!

529
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:11,821
My personal odds-on favorite
from the '88 games,

530
00:43:11,889 --> 00:43:16,292
possibly the greatest player
ever to emerge from the West.

531
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,526
<i>He came out of retirement to be
here, and it's an honor to have him.</i>

532
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:25,058
<i>He's back and he's bad, the
one and only Karl Wolfschtagg!</i>

533
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:27,131
Yeah!

534
00:43:28,973 --> 00:43:31,567
So, we meet again.

535
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:37,476
The years have not been
kind to you.

536
00:43:37,548 --> 00:43:39,379
I will not be either.

537
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:42,977
We have champions from
every continent so, please,

538
00:43:43,053 --> 00:43:45,078
everyone, wear a nametag.

539
00:43:50,928 --> 00:43:55,490
And now, eat, drink, enjoy.

540
00:44:00,404 --> 00:44:01,928
My goodness!

541
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:04,201
What a blast from the past!

542
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:09,205
<i>If it isn't my old master.</i>

543
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:12,676
Wong.

544
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,548
<i>You old horn dog.
How's tricks?</i>

545
00:44:17,788 --> 00:44:23,192
I've waited many years to
meet you again, face to face.

546
00:44:25,629 --> 00:44:27,324
Oh, thank you.

547
00:44:27,398 --> 00:44:32,802
<i>Tell me, Randy, does he still dress as
if he shops at Elton John's garage sale?</i>

548
00:44:32,870 --> 00:44:35,270
So, Randy Daytona.

549
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:38,672
<i>The golden boy who couldn't even
bronze. You're Wong's new protégé.</i>

550
00:44:38,742 --> 00:44:42,940
Well, FYI,

551
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:45,573
Wong always said
I was his greatest pupil.

552
00:44:45,649 --> 00:44:49,483
I said you could have been great,
but you never finished your training.

553
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:53,353
As I recall,
you kicked me out.

554
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:57,383
But you did teach me
one thing, Master.

555
00:44:57,461 --> 00:44:58,723
Promptness.

556
00:44:58,796 --> 00:45:01,629
And you were 15 minutes late
to the banquet.

557
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:03,189
Soup got cold.

558
00:45:16,947 --> 00:45:19,142
Oh, Feng!

559
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,752
<i>Don't let it happen again.</i>

560
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:33,192
Gentlemen. Athletes.

561
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:35,593
I bid you toodles.

562
00:45:51,582 --> 00:45:56,952
<i>May I invite you to select from one
of Mr. Feng's courtesans of pleasure.</i>

563
00:45:57,020 --> 00:45:58,612
Like sex slaves?

564
00:46:02,793 --> 00:46:03,987
No.

565
00:46:05,395 --> 00:46:07,454
<i>No, I couldn't do that.</i>

566
00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,426
No, I couldn't. I couldn't.

567
00:46:14,171 --> 00:46:15,399
No, no.

568
00:46:15,472 --> 00:46:17,940
I got this girlfriend
back home.

569
00:46:18,008 --> 00:46:21,444
<i>I mean, she's not
my girlfriend. "Yet. "</i>

570
00:46:21,512 --> 00:46:23,503
Mr. Feng has gone
to great lengths

571
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:27,016
to select the most beautiful
courtesans from around the world.

572
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:31,544
They are fully versed in both
the sensual and the erotic arts.

573
00:46:32,322 --> 00:46:35,018
<i>Well, I mean,
I don't want to be rude.</i>

574
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:51,304
<i>What's up?</i>

575
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:55,540
These are...
These are all...

576
00:46:55,612 --> 00:46:57,603
These guys,
these are dudes.

577
00:46:57,681 --> 00:47:02,448
They are fully prepared to satisfy
each and every one of your desires.

578
00:47:02,519 --> 00:47:08,355
Well, my desires are pretty
much all satisfied up, right now.

579
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:10,826
<i>So, I'm good.</i>

580
00:47:10,894 --> 00:47:12,862
You must choose one.

581
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:18,059
Look, tell Feng
they are all so great...

582
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:19,966
Fine. I'll pick.

583
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:21,129
Gary.
Yo!

584
00:47:21,205 --> 00:47:22,229
Feeling good?
Oh, yeah.

585
00:47:22,306 --> 00:47:24,365
Hop to it.
The rest of you, get out.

586
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:25,669
That...

587
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:30,339
Can I talk to you
for a second?

588
00:47:30,414 --> 00:47:32,905
Sweet dreams, Mr. Daytona.

589
00:47:44,161 --> 00:47:47,130
I got a huge day tomorrow.
Big day.

590
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,425
Can you...

591
00:47:48,498 --> 00:47:49,522
No can do.

592
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,763
<i>Look, if I don't spend
the night in here, it's...</i>

593
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:55,527
Are you kidding me?

594
00:47:55,606 --> 00:47:56,595
<i>No, I'm not kidding.</i>

595
00:47:56,673 --> 00:47:59,107
<i>If I had known
I'd end up as a sex slave,</i>

596
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:02,077
I never would've gone
to that audition in Orlando.

597
00:48:02,145 --> 00:48:03,635
I thought I was gonna be doing
cruise ship shows.

598
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:06,740
Next thing I know, boom.
Sex slave.

599
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:08,978
Always read
the fine print, amigo.

600
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:11,919
Hey, you want a brew?
I sure could use one.

601
00:48:12,923 --> 00:48:14,584
Yeah.
Yeah. Cool.

602
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,821
Here you go, dude.

603
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:32,469
So... So.

604
00:48:35,679 --> 00:48:37,112
Board game?
You want to play a board game?

605
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,977
Yes, play a board game.
Okay, cool.

606
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,543
Whoa, you got Boggle, huh?

607
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,180
That sounds like
a challenge to me.

608
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,349
Yeah, okay, sure.

609
00:48:50,694 --> 00:48:52,059
All right.

610
00:48:53,964 --> 00:48:56,524
<i>Sounds like somebody's
getting lucky.</i>

611
00:49:02,706 --> 00:49:06,802
Oh, no, no, dude. I want a
rematch. Best out of seven!

612
00:49:06,877 --> 00:49:10,074
You can not defeat me.
I am the Boggle master.

613
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:13,510
Kick some ass out there.
Kick some ass, all right?

614
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:14,709
All right. Thanks, man.
Appreciate it.

615
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,252
Be careful. Okay?

616
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:18,185
All we did was play Boggle.

617
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:20,746
Hey, how you doing, Master?
Good morning.

618
00:49:20,824 --> 00:49:22,792
<i>Oh, gweilo.</i>

619
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:25,327
Have you tried
these pleasure girls?

620
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:28,660
My girl, she really knows
how to handle a man.

621
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:29,994
Oh, boy!

622
00:49:32,002 --> 00:49:35,438
What the hell is up with
these courtesans of pleasure?

623
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:38,902
Master had a fantastic time
last night.

624
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:42,209
Oh, man.

625
00:49:42,279 --> 00:49:43,303
Yeah.

626
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,870
Did you find anything?

627
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:46,848
They got this place
locked down pretty tight,

628
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:48,350
<i>but I'm gonna
snoop around today.</i>

629
00:49:48,418 --> 00:49:49,442
Okay.

630
00:50:03,266 --> 00:50:04,358
Huh?

631
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:07,261
He needs to go to bathroom.

632
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,797
Down the hall,
eighth door on the left.

633
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:13,570
The switch is on the right.

634
00:50:40,303 --> 00:50:44,000
Welcome to
my tournament of champions.

635
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:48,773
The tournament is single
elimination, sudden death.

636
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:51,377
Let the games begin.

637
00:50:51,448 --> 00:50:54,042
The game is to 11.

638
00:50:54,117 --> 00:50:55,379
Must win by two.

639
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:58,612
The first competitors are...

640
00:50:59,089 --> 00:51:01,284
Freddy "Fingers" Wilson.

641
00:51:01,358 --> 00:51:02,382
Wonderful.

642
00:51:02,459 --> 00:51:04,256
This is Freddy Fingers.

643
00:51:12,536 --> 00:51:13,696
And...

644
00:51:15,105 --> 00:51:16,868
Randy Daytona.

645
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:24,673
<i>Hello, Feng's mansion!</i>

646
00:51:27,984 --> 00:51:29,747
How was Disneyland?

647
00:52:02,018 --> 00:52:03,451
Good luck, man.

648
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,681
Blow it out your ass, bitch.

649
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:11,218
Game point.

650
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:25,257
Randy Daytona is the victor.

651
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:29,429
Randy!

652
00:53:29,506 --> 00:53:30,871
Give it up!

653
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:33,606
Can I hear a word?

654
00:53:33,677 --> 00:53:36,305
Can I hear a double "huh-huh"?

655
00:53:50,961 --> 00:53:52,292
Randy.

656
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:55,154
<i>Fantastique.</i>

657
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:58,824
Wong always did have
an eye for talent.

658
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:01,029
Too bad they're not good
for anything else.

659
00:54:03,340 --> 00:54:04,534
You killed him?

660
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:05,768
Well, duh.

661
00:54:05,842 --> 00:54:08,811
<i>What part of "sudden death"
didn't you understand?</i>

662
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:47,177
Ow!

663
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:04,426
<i>What's up?</i>

664
00:55:04,501 --> 00:55:09,029
Come, walk with me. Randy,
I have a proposition for you.

665
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:13,400
<i>I won't bite.
Not anywhere that will show.</i>

666
00:55:18,682 --> 00:55:22,209
Guess a guy like you has to have a lot
of security around all the time, huh?

667
00:55:22,285 --> 00:55:26,278
<i>Oh, them. They're just for show.
Nobody'd try anything in here.</i>

668
00:55:27,691 --> 00:55:29,352
Give me the thing.

669
00:55:30,126 --> 00:55:32,560
This is the real security.

670
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:35,120
The whole place
is wired to blow.

671
00:55:35,198 --> 00:55:39,862
<i>I'd hate to have to relocate. The
place ain't much, but it's homey.</i>

672
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:44,233
Voila.

673
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:54,348
<i>I don't usually give strangers the
full tour, but I don't know. Randy...</i>

674
00:55:57,587 --> 00:55:58,952
I like you.

675
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:03,990
Go ahead.

676
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,425
After you.

677
00:56:11,835 --> 00:56:16,431
Guns is my new business,
and business is booming.

678
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:19,566
These new polymer guns
go on sale Thursday.

679
00:56:19,642 --> 00:56:22,270
They go right through
a metal detector.

680
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:23,972
Enough shop talk.

681
00:56:31,087 --> 00:56:33,487
Let me show you
my pride and joy.

682
00:56:34,991 --> 00:56:35,980
Snazzy.

683
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,083
Yeah.

684
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,856
<i>It's my own private table.
Custom made.</i>

685
00:56:40,830 --> 00:56:43,958
You have to wear
these vests to play.

686
00:56:44,033 --> 00:56:48,163
The batteries in them store
enough electricity to kill 3.8 men.

687
00:56:48,238 --> 00:56:50,638
Every time you miss,
the voltage doubles.

688
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:53,904
Two-nothing feels like you
just stuck a fork in a toaster.

689
00:56:53,977 --> 00:56:56,468
<i>Nobody's ever made it
past three-zip.</i>

690
00:56:56,546 --> 00:57:00,312
This guy here,
five-time world champ.

691
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:06,419
Randy, let me cut through
the bullpoop.

692
00:57:06,489 --> 00:57:11,893
<i>I'd like you to come and work for me
as my personal assistantlhanger-on.</i>

693
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:15,054
Me?
Yeah.

694
00:57:15,131 --> 00:57:16,223
Why?

695
00:57:16,299 --> 00:57:20,099
<i>Because I think you'd make a
wonderful addition to the Triad.</i>

696
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:22,262
Really? Me?

697
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:24,272
Of course not, no.

698
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:28,333
<i>I want you 'cause
it would break Wong's heart.</i>

699
00:57:28,411 --> 00:57:32,939
Me, his old pupil, luring
his protégé to the dark side

700
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:35,075
is such a Kodak moment.

701
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:46,595
Do you have any idea how hard
it is to get a panda these days?

702
00:57:46,663 --> 00:57:48,062
Really hard.

703
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:53,830
<i>Maybe he's dead. I'm not sure.
I'm not really sure what they eat.</i>

704
00:57:56,673 --> 00:57:57,935
Oh, well.

705
00:58:04,113 --> 00:58:05,546
Back to the old grindstone.

706
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:06,877
Oh, man.

707
00:58:27,537 --> 00:58:31,029
You're gonna come to the Vishnu
shrine in the bamboo grove.

708
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:36,739
You're gonna go, lower hand low five,
lower hand low five, upper hand high five.

709
00:58:36,813 --> 00:58:39,213
And then you're in.
You got it?

710
00:58:40,483 --> 00:58:41,575
What?

711
00:58:44,053 --> 00:58:46,453
If the guns are there, I'll set
the beacon and my guys will be here

712
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:48,286
before he scores another
point. All right? Relax.

713
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,882
Just hurry!

714
00:58:58,935 --> 00:59:01,836
I blow you a fart.
How do you like that?

715
00:59:02,906 --> 00:59:07,502
Randy Daytona
versus Yukito Nagasaki.

716
00:59:56,626 --> 00:59:58,617
This one is for you, Daytona!

717
01:00:02,565 --> 01:00:04,499
Set and match.

718
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:15,334
<i>Where's everybody at?</i>

719
01:00:15,411 --> 01:00:17,743
Coming up after the break,
the final round.

720
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:21,545
Randy Daytona
versus Karl Wolfschtagg.

721
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:31,921
You are so close to defeat, till it
already reeks of your cheap cologne.

722
01:00:31,995 --> 01:00:36,295
<i>The joke's on you, pretty boy. It's
not cologne, it's Lady Speed Stick.</i>

723
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:39,661
Thank you, Master.

724
01:00:48,144 --> 01:00:51,739
Listen to me. You said that you
were gonna get me out of here, right?

725
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:55,045
<i>They were supposed to be here
by now. Look, don't worry, Randy.</i>

726
01:00:55,118 --> 01:00:56,449
I got a plan B.

727
01:00:56,519 --> 01:00:57,850
You got a plan B?

728
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:01,048
Trust me. Meet me in
the john in two minutes.

729
01:01:07,864 --> 01:01:09,195
<i>Welcome to Feng's bathroom.</i>

730
01:01:09,265 --> 01:01:10,289
Hey.

731
01:01:10,366 --> 01:01:13,665
May I interest you in an
Altoid or some Axe Body Spray?

732
01:01:13,736 --> 01:01:16,534
Hey, these shoes
look like they need a shine?

733
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,708
Hi.

734
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:29,217
Daytona.

735
01:01:29,285 --> 01:01:34,018
I have said some cruel things about you
to my friends here at the tournament.

736
01:01:34,090 --> 01:01:36,752
I told them that the reason
that you hate me so much

737
01:01:36,826 --> 01:01:39,351
is because I had sex
with your mother.

738
01:01:39,429 --> 01:01:41,863
My mother died when I was two.
I hardly knew her.

739
01:01:41,931 --> 01:01:44,764
<i>Yeah, I know.
It's a horrible thing to say.</i>

740
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:50,330
And yet these things that
I say, over and over again,

741
01:01:53,609 --> 01:01:55,338
I do not mean them.

742
01:01:56,946 --> 01:01:59,141
<i>'Cause, in truth,</i>

743
01:01:59,215 --> 01:02:02,707
you are the greatest player
I have ever seen.

744
01:02:04,353 --> 01:02:06,014
Other than myself.

745
01:02:07,090 --> 01:02:09,422
Practicing in front
of a mirror.

746
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:12,459
Which I do.

747
01:02:14,263 --> 01:02:15,525
Every day.

748
01:02:18,201 --> 01:02:19,600
In the nude.

749
01:02:22,472 --> 01:02:25,600
<i>I'm sorry for you that your
papa is not here to see you.</i>

750
01:02:25,675 --> 01:02:27,472
I think he would
be very proud of you.

751
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:29,204
Yeah.

752
01:02:29,278 --> 01:02:33,578
So proud of you that he would
probably bet some money on you again.

753
01:02:34,717 --> 01:02:37,652
I could use the cash. Ha-ha.

754
01:02:37,720 --> 01:02:40,621
<i>Tell your dead parents
I said, "What's up?"</i>

755
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,409
We're staying.

756
01:03:03,479 --> 01:03:05,174
Win or lose,
I got to play him.

757
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:10,514
<i>I can't keep running away
from that German fruit salad.</i>

758
01:03:10,586 --> 01:03:13,020
Now I am proud.

759
01:03:13,089 --> 01:03:17,025
It is better to die like a
tiger than to live like a pussy.

760
01:03:18,661 --> 01:03:20,959
<i>I'm gonna go tell Rodriguez.</i>

761
01:03:23,599 --> 01:03:24,930
Rodriguez?

762
01:03:30,072 --> 01:03:31,437
Rodriguez?

763
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:34,004
Open! Eat it!

764
01:03:35,044 --> 01:03:36,409
Eat it!

765
01:03:42,251 --> 01:03:44,811
How was I supposed to know you
were gonna change your mind?

766
01:03:44,887 --> 01:03:48,448
<i>Silence. What's done is done.
Let's hope it works.</i>

767
01:03:48,524 --> 01:03:49,786
I hate you guys.

768
01:03:49,859 --> 01:03:52,657
<i>Mr. Feng,
there's been an accident.</i>

769
01:03:52,728 --> 01:03:53,922
Oh, no!

770
01:03:55,731 --> 01:03:56,891
What have you...

771
01:03:56,966 --> 01:03:58,934
I broke it.

772
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:02,797
Oh, my God!

773
01:04:02,872 --> 01:04:04,237
Did that hurt?
Yes!

774
01:04:04,307 --> 01:04:05,467
Oh, dear.

775
01:04:08,544 --> 01:04:12,378
I have no choice.
I have to disqualify you.

776
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:15,144
I suppose
Karl is our champion.

777
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:18,517
Oh yeah! Oh yeah!

778
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:20,749
This is far from over,
Daytona!

779
01:04:20,823 --> 01:04:21,812
You suck!

780
01:04:21,924 --> 01:04:25,860
Hey! Hey, come on.
That stings. Who said that?

781
01:04:27,263 --> 01:04:31,199
Well, poop. Randy, I was
serious about my offer, okay?

782
01:04:31,267 --> 01:04:33,531
And e-mail me
when you make up your mind.

783
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:37,903
<i>I'm Pradafan1@gmail. com.
"Pradafan" is all one word.</i>

784
01:04:37,974 --> 01:04:40,704
<i>I can't tell you
how disappointed I am.</i>

785
01:04:52,421 --> 01:04:58,087
<i>I'm afraid your reputation has
preceded you, Agent Rodriguez.</i>

786
01:04:59,095 --> 01:05:01,723
Are you still waiting
for your backup?

787
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:07,134
Bad guys have
homing beacons, too.

788
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:12,068
Competition will continue
as scheduled.

789
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:15,702
Hope you're a good southpaw.

790
01:05:28,724 --> 01:05:31,659
Three-point game.
To the death.

791
01:05:35,197 --> 01:05:36,425
Come on.

792
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:59,520
<i>I'm cool, man. I'm cool.</i>

793
01:06:06,362 --> 01:06:09,525
Oops. Clumsy, clumsy hippos.

794
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:11,395
You should be more careful
with your racquet.

795
01:06:11,467 --> 01:06:13,526
<i>It's not like
I get these shoes for free.</i>

796
01:06:13,602 --> 01:06:15,968
Oh, wait. Yes, I do.
I do get them for free.

797
01:06:16,038 --> 01:06:17,471
Time out.

798
01:06:17,540 --> 01:06:21,135
<i>Master, look. It's your brother's
paddle. It's my winning paddle.</i>

799
01:06:21,210 --> 01:06:22,768
<i>I mean, I don't know what
the hell I'm gonna do now.</i>

800
01:06:22,845 --> 01:06:25,279
<i>Gweilo!
Have I taught you nothing?</i>

801
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:29,951
Game not in paddle.
Game in you.

802
01:06:32,088 --> 01:06:34,420
You cannot change
what is past.

803
01:06:35,391 --> 01:06:37,882
You must play for this man.

804
01:06:41,397 --> 01:06:44,059
Here, use this paddle.

805
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:48,633
It belongs to the greatest
player I have ever known.

806
01:07:01,417 --> 01:07:02,975
Thanks, Master.

807
01:07:16,899 --> 01:07:19,390
<i>Gunter, glieben,
glauchen, globen</i>

808
01:07:23,105 --> 01:07:24,595
<i>All right</i>

809
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:29,811
<i>I got something to say</i>

810
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:34,680
<i>Yeah, it's better to burn out</i>

811
01:07:34,750 --> 01:07:37,810
<i>Yeah, than fade away</i>

812
01:07:40,156 --> 01:07:42,317
<i>All right</i>

813
01:07:49,098 --> 01:07:51,464
<i>Gonna start a fire</i>

814
01:07:54,437 --> 01:07:55,631
<i>Come on</i>

815
01:07:55,704 --> 01:07:57,899
<i>Rise up, gather round</i>

816
01:07:57,973 --> 01:08:00,168
<i>Rock this place to the ground</i>

817
01:08:00,242 --> 01:08:02,335
<i>Burn it up, let's go for broke</i>

818
01:08:02,411 --> 01:08:04,743
<i>Watch the night go up in smoke</i>

819
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:07,078
<i>Rock on, rock on</i>

820
01:08:07,149 --> 01:08:09,276
<i>Drive me crazier</i>

821
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:11,581
<i>No serenade, no fire brigade</i>

822
01:08:11,654 --> 01:08:14,350
<i>Just pyromania, come on</i>

823
01:08:14,423 --> 01:08:18,119
<i>What do you want?</i>

824
01:08:18,194 --> 01:08:20,992
<i>I want rock 'n' roll</i>

825
01:08:21,063 --> 01:08:22,963
<i>Yes, I do</i>

826
01:08:23,032 --> 01:08:25,227
<i>Long live rock 'n' roll</i>

827
01:08:25,301 --> 01:08:27,166
<i>Oh, let's go,
let's strike a light</i>

828
01:08:27,236 --> 01:08:29,227
<i>We're gonna blow like dynamite</i>

829
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:37,268
<i>There will be a slight change in
today's program for the final match.</i>

830
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:40,713
The part of Karl Wolfschtagg
will be played by...

831
01:08:47,056 --> 01:08:48,990
Maggie!
Randy.

832
01:08:49,058 --> 01:08:50,355
Maggie!
No, Randy, no.

833
01:08:50,426 --> 01:08:54,419
You get to play her
to the death.

834
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:57,489
I thought this would be
much more interesting, huh?

835
01:08:57,566 --> 01:08:58,897
You bastard.
What?

836
01:08:58,968 --> 01:09:02,832
This is an outrage!

837
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:06,306
I demand retribution!
I did not come all this way...

838
01:09:09,945 --> 01:09:12,004
Oh, great, blow dart, yeah?

839
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:13,975
Super.

840
01:09:25,327 --> 01:09:26,589
Master, you got to
help me out.

841
01:09:26,662 --> 01:09:28,687
You got to give me
some advice, anything, please.

842
01:09:28,764 --> 01:09:30,755
<i>Sorry, gweilo, I'm out.</i>

843
01:09:30,866 --> 01:09:34,768
<i>"Game not in paddle, game in
you," is usually my big finish.</i>

844
01:09:43,746 --> 01:09:44,735
I missed you.

845
01:09:44,813 --> 01:09:45,905
I missed you, too.

846
01:09:45,981 --> 01:09:49,678
Hey. Less talkie-talkie.
More Ping-Pong.

847
01:09:52,354 --> 01:09:54,845
Three-point game to the death.

848
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:00,460
Maggie, come on.

849
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:02,759
<i>I'm not gonna play you, Randy.</i>

850
01:10:04,066 --> 01:10:07,194
It would be an honor for me
to give you my life.

851
01:10:08,337 --> 01:10:11,272
One-zero. Randy Daytona.

852
01:10:19,782 --> 01:10:22,512
<i>I don't know why you couldn't
just say that you love me.</i>

853
01:10:22,585 --> 01:10:23,677
I...

854
01:10:24,353 --> 01:10:25,377
One-One.

855
01:10:25,454 --> 01:10:27,149
<i>That's not fair.
That wasn't fair.</i>

856
01:10:27,823 --> 01:10:30,690
<i>Randy, I'm trying to sacrifice
my life for our love.</i>

857
01:10:30,759 --> 01:10:32,522
Stop being such a dick!

858
01:10:34,763 --> 01:10:37,061
<i>I'm not gonna let you lose,
Maggie.</i>

859
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:40,427
Here we go.

860
01:10:44,773 --> 01:10:46,798
This is not very honorable!

861
01:10:52,848 --> 01:10:54,509
I love you, Maggie.

862
01:11:00,489 --> 01:11:03,754
Boring. Kill them.
Kill them both.

863
01:11:03,826 --> 01:11:05,953
<i>We're missing
Antiques Roadshow.</i>

864
01:11:09,665 --> 01:11:10,757
No.

865
01:11:17,339 --> 01:11:18,772
Oh, crap!

866
01:11:22,711 --> 01:11:24,941
Get to cover! Come on!

867
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:28,882
You want to play rough?
Okay! Go! Go! Go!

868
01:11:32,254 --> 01:11:35,883
Stop it! Are you insane?
These are not replicas!

869
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:40,224
Well, some of them are, but
they're limited edition replicas.

870
01:11:40,296 --> 01:11:42,196
<i>Backup's right outside,
they just signaled.</i>

871
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:44,926
<i>I didn't sneak in
two of these for nothing.</i>

872
01:11:48,771 --> 01:11:51,035
<i>This is the FBI.</i>

873
01:12:01,517 --> 01:12:03,007
Oh, my God!
What?

874
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:05,610
Wait a minute,
I forgot something, guys.

875
01:12:05,688 --> 01:12:06,677
What?

876
01:12:06,755 --> 01:12:08,052
Come here, baby.

877
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:10,916
Wish me luck.

878
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,017
Good luck.

879
01:12:12,094 --> 01:12:13,561
Get to the dock!

880
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:15,221
He took my Uzi.

881
01:12:25,074 --> 01:12:27,008
Get away from the door!

882
01:12:31,113 --> 01:12:32,341
Sweet.

883
01:12:33,916 --> 01:12:35,440
Well, that was awesome of me.

884
01:12:36,518 --> 01:12:38,782
<i>Dude, I totally knew
you'd rescue me!</i>

885
01:12:38,887 --> 01:12:43,381
Okay! All right! Okay! All right! As
a friend! As a friend, I rescued you.

886
01:12:43,459 --> 01:12:44,483
Oh, right. Yeah. Right.

887
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:45,959
Follow me!

888
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:48,954
This way. Up the stairs!

889
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:51,365
Oh, crap!

890
01:12:56,038 --> 01:12:57,300
So what? What?
What are you gonna do?

891
01:12:57,373 --> 01:12:59,364
You gonna murder me
like you murdered my father?

892
01:12:59,441 --> 01:13:01,636
You people sound
like a broken record.

893
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:05,476
<i>"You killed my so-and-so and
you murdered what's- his-face. "</i>

894
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:09,039
<i>"I demand... "
Blah-blah-blah. Get over it.</i>

895
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:12,982
Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait! Wait!
Don't, don't, don't. Feng.

896
01:13:13,856 --> 01:13:16,552
Listen, you kill me now,

897
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:19,560
<i>we're never gonna know
who Wong's best pupil is.</i>

898
01:13:20,295 --> 01:13:21,592
For the record,

899
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:25,657
I think we all assume
that it is Randy.

900
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,264
You win, Wong.

901
01:13:32,341 --> 01:13:34,639
<i>Let's settle this,
once and for all.</i>

902
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:36,143
This rescue sucks, dude.

903
01:13:36,211 --> 01:13:37,644
I know.
Huh?

904
01:13:37,713 --> 01:13:39,510
Not you, you're doing great.

905
01:13:40,783 --> 01:13:44,082
Guys. Guys. Guys!

906
01:13:48,724 --> 01:13:52,717
You, take the self-destruct
doohickey. Just show it to the FBI.

907
01:13:52,795 --> 01:13:56,060
Explain the house is rigged
to blow. That will buy us time.

908
01:13:57,733 --> 01:13:58,927
<i>Ready, gweilo?</i>

909
01:14:14,049 --> 01:14:15,573
Any last words?

910
01:14:17,152 --> 01:14:18,210
Yeah.

911
01:14:20,889 --> 01:14:23,687
<i>Self-destruct sequence
activated.</i>

912
01:14:29,631 --> 01:14:32,566
<i>Five minutes to detonation
and counting.</i>

913
01:14:33,001 --> 01:14:34,468
<i>It's your point, Feng.</i>

914
01:14:34,536 --> 01:14:36,936
I know. My serve, I think.

915
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:40,408
<i>What the hell are you doing?
It's over, Feng.</i>

916
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,808
<i>The Ping-Pong table
doesn't know that.</i>

917
01:14:42,878 --> 01:14:46,279
If we stop playing,
it will kill us both.

918
01:14:46,348 --> 01:14:48,111
<i>You mean,
you can't turn it off?</i>

919
01:14:48,183 --> 01:14:50,083
<i>God, that's so stupid!</i>

920
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:51,141
Randy.

921
01:14:51,220 --> 01:14:52,244
Get to the boat!

922
01:14:52,321 --> 01:14:54,152
<i>Okay, let's get out of here.</i>

923
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:56,816
<i>I'm gonna save the panda!</i>

924
01:15:00,696 --> 01:15:02,186
<i>The panda's dead!</i>

925
01:15:02,798 --> 01:15:05,790
All right, FBI!
You are all under arrest!

926
01:15:06,435 --> 01:15:07,527
FBI!

927
01:15:09,404 --> 01:15:10,530
FBI!

928
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:17,736
Oh, shit!

929
01:15:22,985 --> 01:15:24,316
<i>That's my point, Feng.</i>

930
01:15:30,626 --> 01:15:31,957
But you missed the table!

931
01:15:32,027 --> 01:15:33,790
I changed the rules a little.

932
01:15:33,862 --> 01:15:35,489
I should have told you.

933
01:15:35,564 --> 01:15:38,658
The way I play, you could
hit it off anything you want.

934
01:15:38,734 --> 01:15:41,168
One bounce, it counts.
My bad.

935
01:15:41,236 --> 01:15:42,669
Son of a bitch!

936
01:16:12,601 --> 01:16:13,727
Guys!

937
01:16:18,106 --> 01:16:19,971
This guy looks really tough.

938
01:16:21,810 --> 01:16:23,300
You take him.

939
01:16:59,014 --> 01:17:00,914
<i>Two minutes to detonation.</i>

940
01:17:03,685 --> 01:17:05,949
You should've taken my offer.

941
01:17:06,021 --> 01:17:09,684
I would've given you anything.
Anything in the world!

942
01:17:09,758 --> 01:17:11,749
I want my father back!

943
01:17:11,827 --> 01:17:12,987
Lots of luck!

944
01:17:30,612 --> 01:17:32,079
Come on, get up.

945
01:17:32,414 --> 01:17:35,611
Come on, fast, fast, fast.
Heads down. Heads down.

946
01:17:35,684 --> 01:17:38,812
Get your own boat, Pedro!
I call this one.

947
01:17:41,356 --> 01:17:43,620
Guys! Guys!

948
01:17:43,692 --> 01:17:48,129
Me, the money and the
Chinese broad are taking off.

949
01:17:50,132 --> 01:17:51,360
You see this pen?

950
01:17:51,433 --> 01:17:56,336
This pen contains enough cyanide to
kill everyone within 100-yard radius.

951
01:17:56,405 --> 01:17:58,703
<i>Do you think I'd come in here
without a backup plan?</i>

952
01:17:58,774 --> 01:18:01,800
<i>I'm FBI, pendejo!</i>

953
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:04,641
<i>Now, here's
how it's gonna go down.</i>

954
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:11,882
<i>Hola. You like chorizo?</i>

955
01:18:12,654 --> 01:18:15,316
<i>Let's get out of here.
He's gonna be really mad.</i>

956
01:18:17,359 --> 01:18:18,553
Randy!

957
01:18:19,795 --> 01:18:22,423
<i>Remember
what I told you, gweilo!</i>

958
01:18:23,031 --> 01:18:26,558
Feng only finished
one-half of his training.

959
01:18:30,005 --> 01:18:31,097
Come on.

960
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:44,951
<i>I believe it's my serve, Feng.</i>

961
01:18:47,022 --> 01:18:50,514
Big deal.
I never finished the training.

962
01:18:50,592 --> 01:18:54,358
<i>What's that mean?
I have no honor or something?</i>

963
01:18:54,429 --> 01:18:56,454
It means you have
no backhand.

964
01:19:16,151 --> 01:19:19,416
Oh, shit!

965
01:19:37,672 --> 01:19:43,042
<i>Ten, nine, eight,
seven, six...</i>

966
01:19:43,111 --> 01:19:44,305
Jump!

967
01:19:44,379 --> 01:19:49,112
<i>...five, four, three,
two, one.</i>

968
01:20:07,068 --> 01:20:08,365
Dude, that was amazing!

969
01:20:08,436 --> 01:20:09,460
I love you!

970
01:20:09,538 --> 01:20:10,562
We are so proud of you!

971
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:13,733
Okay. Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you so much.

972
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:16,039
Seriously, stop it!

973
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:39,992
You ready, pussycat?

974
01:20:41,603 --> 01:20:43,833
Say hello to my little friend!

975
01:20:47,475 --> 01:20:48,499
Are you okay?

976
01:20:48,577 --> 01:20:50,442
<i>Let's go, pussycat,
one more time.</i>

977
01:20:50,512 --> 01:20:51,536
You got it?

978
01:20:51,613 --> 01:20:52,602
Yeah.

979
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:55,548
Oh, no!

980
01:20:58,787 --> 01:20:59,776
I heard that.

981
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:04,015
Okay, no more games.

982
01:21:06,761 --> 01:21:09,195
Let me help you with that,
Master.

983
01:21:10,799 --> 01:21:12,266
There you go.

984
01:21:12,334 --> 01:21:16,998
Hey, I wanted to thank you for
everything that you've done for me.

985
01:21:17,072 --> 01:21:21,475
So I got you
a little something.

986
01:21:23,712 --> 01:21:26,272
<i>It's really not necessary.</i>

987
01:21:26,348 --> 01:21:28,316
But Master will accept.

988
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:33,150
<i>What is it? Let me guess.
It's something small.</i>

989
01:21:33,221 --> 01:21:34,245
No, don't...

990
01:21:34,322 --> 01:21:36,222
<i>Cufflinks? It's a ring.</i>

991
01:21:36,291 --> 01:21:37,815
I love jewelry.

992
01:21:39,127 --> 01:21:41,186
<i>I can't guess. What is it?</i>

993
01:21:42,063 --> 01:21:44,054
<i>It's a new lucky cricket.</i>

994
01:21:44,466 --> 01:21:45,455
Oh.

995
01:21:51,539 --> 01:21:52,597
Was.

996
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:55,770
I shall carry it
with me always.

997
01:21:55,844 --> 01:21:56,936
Yeah.

998
01:21:58,947 --> 01:22:01,848
<i>Don't bother.
He's pretty much dead.</i>

999
01:22:02,584 --> 01:22:04,176
No, no, no.
I will carry the box.

1000
01:22:04,252 --> 01:22:07,016
It will bring my spare change
great honor.

1001
01:22:07,088 --> 01:22:09,579
Okay, you do that.
You do that.

1002
01:22:09,724 --> 01:22:11,089
<i>Hey, gweilo!</i>

1003
01:22:12,327 --> 01:22:13,988
I just want to say

1004
01:22:16,965 --> 01:22:18,523
no hard feelings, huh?

1005
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,434
<i>Good luck
on the new school, gweilo.</i>

1006
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:23,902
Thanks, man.

1007
01:22:35,450 --> 01:22:40,012
<i>Dragon say, "May Wong's school
of table tennis last 1,000 years.</i>

1008
01:22:40,088 --> 01:22:42,886
<i>"Or at least until the lease
is up in August. "</i>

1009
01:22:43,658 --> 01:22:45,956
Oh, thanks.

1010
01:22:46,027 --> 01:22:48,552
<i>It's nice.
Thank you very much.</i>

1011
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:51,497
You know, I think we all
learned a valuable lesson.

1012
01:22:57,806 --> 01:23:00,639
<i>Dragon say, "This is
not over yet, whitey!"</i>

1013
01:23:04,846 --> 01:23:06,473
Walk it off, Randy.

1014
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:14,281
A true Ping-Pong player must
always be aware of his surroundings.

1015
01:23:19,627 --> 01:23:21,527
Master, are you all right?

1016
01:23:22,797 --> 01:23:25,095
I am going to Disneyland.

1017
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:29,430
Maybe we should
keep this closed.

1018
01:23:30,205 --> 01:23:33,504
<i>There's a gate here. There's
a blind man walking around.</i>

1019
01:24:17,152 --> 01:24:18,176
Feng!

1020
01:24:21,022 --> 01:24:22,148
Shit!

1021
01:25:03,131 --> 01:25:05,827
<i>I'm not leaving without you,
Ying-Ying!</i>

1022
01:25:09,871 --> 01:25:11,429
<i>Panda's totally fake.</i>

1023
01:25:53,915 --> 01:25:55,348
Feng, not Fang.

1024
01:25:55,416 --> 01:25:56,974
Feng?
Feng.

1025
01:25:57,051 --> 01:25:59,144
I've been calling you Fang
this whole time.

1026
01:25:59,220 --> 01:26:00,812
F- E-N-G.

1027
01:26:00,889 --> 01:26:01,947
Feng?

1028
01:26:02,023 --> 01:26:03,012
All right.

1029
01:26:03,091 --> 01:26:04,080
Please.
