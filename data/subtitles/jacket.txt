2
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,893
- Target four. Wanna take the other truck?
- Roger.

3
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:03,145
Move by the truck.

4
00:01:03,813 --> 00:01:05,064
Move in right there.

5
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,942
Roger. He's wounded. Hit him.
Start hitting the truck.

6
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:12,154
Get the truck and him.
Go forward of it and hit him.

7
00:01:13,823 --> 00:01:15,616
Roger.

8
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,160
Go ahead and store that.

9
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:19,870
Another guy moving right through.

10
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:22,039
Good. Fire. Hit him.

11
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,980
Get down on the floor.

12
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,192
I said, down. Down.

13
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,027
You. Down. Now.

14
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:58,867
Let me see your hands.

15
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:03,330
Get the hands over your head.
Over your head!

16
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,000
Get down.

17
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,047
On your knees.

18
00:02:12,215 --> 00:02:13,841
There. Stay there.

19
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:18,887
Get your hands up.
Get your hands up.

20
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,433
Get down.

21
00:02:24,435 --> 00:02:26,228
Shit, there's a kid in there.

22
00:02:27,188 --> 00:02:29,356
That's not our problem.

23
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,858
None of this is our problem.

24
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,651
Get your hands in the air.

25
00:02:35,864 --> 00:02:36,905
Hey.

26
00:02:43,788 --> 00:02:45,080
How's it going, little man?

27
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:48,792
You all right?

28
00:02:57,051 --> 00:02:59,636
I was 27 years old the first time I died.

29
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,598
I remember there was white everywhere.

30
00:03:02,765 --> 00:03:07,269
There was war, and I felt alive.
But, really, I was dead.

31
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:11,732
- So how old?
- Twenty-seven.

32
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:14,860
Here he is. Starks, Jack.

33
00:03:15,069 --> 00:03:18,572
Born in Vermont.
Hasn't got a family listed.

34
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:21,158
Naval hospital will take care of it.

35
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:28,081
Oh, my God.

36
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:31,460
- This soldier's alive. This man just blinked.
- Been tagged already.

37
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:34,338
- Worry about the others.
- No, no, look at this.

38
00:03:35,423 --> 00:03:39,676
Oh, shit. Code blue, code blue.
We need a doctor.

39
00:03:39,844 --> 00:03:42,512
Get a doctor over here now.

40
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:47,851
Sergeant Starks was very lucky.

41
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,479
A little more to the right,
it wouldn't have come out.

42
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,357
He has retrograde amnesia,
acute psychological suppression.

43
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:54,816
We couldn't find any family...

44
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,443
in the States, sergeant.

45
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,404
- I'm sure you have friends.
- I want the paperwork this afternoon.

46
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:02,574
- Get him on the next flight out of here.
- Yes, sir.

47
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:06,495
He's recommended you for
the Bronze Star. Sergeant.

48
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:09,998
- There is help for you, sergeant.
- Of course there is.

49
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:12,334
Of course there is.

50
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,972
You guys all right?

51
00:04:26,057 --> 00:04:29,226
- Our car won't start.
- That's your mom?

52
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,020
- Yeah.
- What's your mom's name?

53
00:04:33,231 --> 00:04:34,731
Jean.

54
00:04:35,441 --> 00:04:36,692
Hey, Jean.

55
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,153
Can you hear me?

56
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,116
Can you wake up?

57
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,827
I need you to try and stay awake.

58
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:51,623
- Oh, God.
- Your mom taking anything?

59
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,678
- What's your name?
- Jackie.

60
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:07,973
Nice to meet you, Jackie.

61
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:11,018
Tell you what. Why don't you do this.

62
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:13,312
Wrap it around yourself...

63
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:17,065
and you try and keep your mom awake,
and I'll go work on your car.

64
00:05:17,233 --> 00:05:19,234
- All right?
- Okay.

65
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,712
Oh, God.

66
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:42,716
No. Oh, no...

67
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,224
What do you think of all this snow?

68
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:55,103
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

69
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,399
What are these?

70
00:06:01,235 --> 00:06:05,447
Those are dog tags. See, they got the name
and the date of birth on them.

71
00:06:05,615 --> 00:06:08,575
- What for?
- In case I get lost...

72
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:12,662
- Or can't remember who I am.
- Can I have them?

73
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:17,250
- Yeah, you can have them.
- Thanks.

74
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,798
You think you can reach the ignition?

75
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:25,300
Go ahead and give it a shot.

76
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:30,263
Just keep turning, all right?

77
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,773
Keep going.

78
00:06:41,692 --> 00:06:42,943
It works.

79
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:52,577
Hey, get your fucking hands off...

80
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:57,999
Get your fucking hands off my daughter.
Get your fucking hands off my daughter.

81
00:06:58,167 --> 00:07:03,255
- Mom, he fixed our car.
- Jackie, get in that car. Now.

82
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:06,800
- Mom. He fixed the car.
- Get in the goddamn car!

83
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,681
- How's it going?
- Pretty good, man.

84
00:07:54,849 --> 00:07:56,975
- Where you headed?
- On up in Canada.

85
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,311
- I can take you to the border.
- That'd be great.

86
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:02,230
- All right, bud, jump on in.
- It's freezing.

87
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,734
- Hey, man.
- Hey. Thanks.

88
00:08:05,902 --> 00:08:07,736
Jump on in here. Hey, no problem.

89
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,863
My God, it's cold.

90
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:13,033
- Must've been freezing out there, boy.
- Yeah.

91
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:18,538
It's colder than a witch's titty with
a brass bra on doing pushups in the snow.

92
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,959
- So you drive?
- Yeah, sure.

93
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,337
All right, man, great.
We'll switch up in a bit.

94
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:31,927
You ever been to jail?

95
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:36,181
- No, I've never been to jail.
- I'll tell you what, buddy...

96
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:38,433
it's a whole lot
goddamn worse than war.

97
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:40,727
It's probably worse
than anywhere you been.

98
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:42,604
I doubt that.

99
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:46,358
Are you kidding me?

100
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:49,277
What's he pulling us over for?

101
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:52,906
Recreation.

102
00:08:56,577 --> 00:09:02,499
Jackie and Jean are the only things
you know for certain about that day?

103
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,042
Yes.

104
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:10,590
Are you aware that we have no last name,
no place of residence...

105
00:09:10,883 --> 00:09:17,097
and no record of any physical
presence for these friends of yours?

106
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:25,438
I'm afraid I might have to actually
hear that answer, Mr. Starks.

107
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:28,817
Yes.

108
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,987
Officer Harrison
had been shot three times.

109
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,658
He was long dead
by the time we got there.

110
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,785
Jack Starks could be
blocking the incident.

111
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:42,581
It would explain his well-conceived plan
about the little girl and her mother.

112
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,874
- Objection.
- I have heard of Gulf War syndrome.

113
00:09:45,042 --> 00:09:48,795
War is just a CNN special. Half the shit
that went on in Operation Desert Storm...

114
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:52,007
can't be tidied into
a top-of-the-hour headline.

115
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:55,677
Couldn't be said neatly,
so couldn't be said at all.

116
00:09:55,845 --> 00:09:57,637
- There was someone else.
- War's ugly.

117
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:01,766
- And they don't put ugly on TV.
- My client thinks he already died once.

118
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:06,271
- I don't really remember all of it...
- He doesn't know what's going on.

119
00:10:07,773 --> 00:10:09,774
But there was someone else.

120
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:13,320
I think that's what happened.

121
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:16,364
If Starks did kill that officer...

122
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:19,284
can't hold a man responsible
for a damaged mind.

123
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:24,664
We, the jury, find the defendant
not guilty by reason of insanity.

124
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,669
Jack Starks, I hereby sentence you
to be committed...

125
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,505
to an institution
for the criminally insane...

126
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:36,635
where I hope the doctors
and proper treatment can help you.

127
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:38,470
Come on, bud.

128
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:53,818
Come on.

129
00:12:33,627 --> 00:12:35,962
What are you doing?

130
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:54,189
Get him up.

131
00:13:47,368 --> 00:13:49,327
Please believe...

132
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:51,663
What are you doing? I don't belong here.

133
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:55,667
- I don't belong here.
- No, I don't think you do either.

134
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:58,545
But neither of us
can do anything about that now.

135
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:06,052
Please. Please.

136
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,830
Let me out of here.

137
00:15:16,415 --> 00:15:18,875
Let me out of here. Please.

138
00:15:38,979 --> 00:15:41,105
- How much did you give him?
- Fifty cc's.

139
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:43,775
- And he's been in for the full three hours?
- Yes, sir.

140
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,110
Okay, get him out.

141
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:55,328
Jack, can you hear me?

142
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,751
Jack, blink for me if you can.

143
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:12,637
- He didn't lose consciousness.
- Do you wanna put him back in?

144
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,555
No, take him out of it.

145
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:17,684
Take him upstairs
and check his vitals every hour.

146
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:45,378
Now that's, I think, the context
in which to view what's going on.

147
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:56,305
Perhaps you may have seen a lead story
in The New York Times.

148
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:07,150
Good morning, Dr. Lorenson.

149
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:16,159
You're the cop killer, right?

150
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:21,164
- That obvious?
- TV, you know?

151
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:24,292
Helps soothe an active mind.

152
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:28,838
I'm Rudy Mackenzie. Welcome.

153
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:31,174
Listen, I...

154
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:35,595
- I don't really feel like talking.
- You know, that's a shame.

155
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,889
I don't believe
in disposable language either.

156
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,725
You know, small talk, little talk,
chitchat. Useless.

157
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,519
The game.
The game's something else, though.

158
00:17:43,687 --> 00:17:49,859
This here is our court.
I'm ready to throw the ball. Come on.

159
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,362
All right.

160
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,364
What are you in here for?

161
00:17:57,785 --> 00:18:03,539
- I tried to kill my wife.
- Don't you go to jail for that?

162
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:08,377
Yeah, well, I tried, like, 30 times.
I never planned on doing it, you know?

163
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:11,089
It was always
in the heat of the moment.

164
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:15,760
And she kept threatening
to have me put away until finally...

165
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:18,179
she did.

166
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:23,518
- Thirty times might make you seem crazy.
- Yeah, or just... Or just plain stupid.

167
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:28,272
Because you'd think by the 20th time,
I would've found an alternative method...

168
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:33,528
- Or maybe a more effective one.
- Morning, gentlemen. How you doing today?

169
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:36,989
For me that is a really
difficult question, Dr. Lorenson...

170
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:41,202
because the world around me is shrinking,
and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse...

171
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:44,413
are coming to see me today,
and they're not bringing flowers...

172
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:47,875
which just makes it really difficult
to get organized.

173
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,839
And you, Mr. Starks?

174
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,801
- I'm fine.
- So you're okay?

175
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,846
You tell me, doc.

176
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,058
You think there's
something wrong with me?

177
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:06,811
You're a little underweight.

178
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:10,523
Maybe I'm working it off in my dreams.

179
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,111
Done with the small talk?

180
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:25,163
Hey, it's okay.

181
00:19:36,383 --> 00:19:39,886
Mr. Starks, glad to see
you're cooperating this time.

182
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:43,556
We're here to help, Jack.
We're only doing what's best for you.

183
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,230
Hold him while I get the tranquilizer.

184
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:53,399
- Get him down. Fuck the tranquilizer.
- No.

185
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:57,278
No, that's not necessary. Get him up.

186
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,825
Nurse, get the jacket.

187
00:20:02,993 --> 00:20:05,828
The only thing
your mind's missing's a conscience.

188
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:11,083
Wait. Dr. Becker, how long
do you want us to leave him in for?

189
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:12,668
Just strap him in for now.

190
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:31,812
Help. Help, please.

191
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:35,566
Motherfucker.

192
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:44,784
Let me out of here.

193
00:20:48,997 --> 00:20:51,499
- You okay?
- I'm fine.

194
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,839
- Listen, I hate to bother you.
- Then don't.

195
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,883
But what about Starks?

196
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:04,136
What about Starks?

197
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:06,055
Should we be just...?

198
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:09,934
Should we be trying to help him
any way we can?

199
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,603
- Yes.
- Should we be leaving him in there like that?

200
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:16,274
The medication I've given him
is intended to adjust...

201
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:22,571
maybe even reset, his violent proclivities.
Peel away some layers of hate.

202
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:25,366
The apparatus is merely
a safe place for that to happen.

203
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:30,454
The grounds and the halls, where I can't
monitor side effects I can't predict, aren't.

204
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:33,582
But how can you be monitoring
the effects while he's in there?

205
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:37,503
I consider the time he's spent
in there part of the treatment.

206
00:21:41,842 --> 00:21:44,510
You can't break something
that's already broken.

207
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:10,286
I don't belong here.

208
00:22:12,706 --> 00:22:17,376
I can't breathe in here.

209
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,796
I can't...

210
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,846
I can't breathe in here.

211
00:22:35,395 --> 00:22:37,855
I'm gonna blow your head off.

212
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,100
In case you hadn't figured,
it's Christmas Eve.

213
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,644
You're never gonna get a cab here.

214
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,688
Thanks.

215
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,357
You got somewhere
you need to go?

216
00:24:06,027 --> 00:24:07,361
I'm not sure.

217
00:24:07,988 --> 00:24:10,114
Well, let me ask you that again.

218
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,284
This time, look around
and consider your options.

219
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:17,746
Have you got somewhere
you need to go?

220
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:21,167
Yeah, I do.

221
00:24:21,751 --> 00:24:24,587
Well, great. Get in.

222
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,761
So where can I take you?

223
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:35,598
I don't know.

224
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:39,268
- What do you mean, you don't know?
- I don't know.

225
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:42,938
Okay.

226
00:24:48,862 --> 00:24:53,324
Well, there must be
another shelter I can call.

227
00:24:55,869 --> 00:24:59,830
Yeah, well, thanks a lot.
Merry Christmas to you too.

228
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,707
Great.

229
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,335
That was our last option.

230
00:25:07,047 --> 00:25:09,507
What am I gonna do with you?

231
00:25:10,133 --> 00:25:11,800
Nothing.

232
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,597
I'll...

233
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:20,226
- Listen, thanks for bringing me this far.
- Where are you going?

234
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:23,145
You'll freeze out there.
You don't even have a coat.

235
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:27,525
- I'll manage.
- No, you won't.

236
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:32,071
You'll die of cold,
and then I'll have to feel guilty.

237
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:35,241
And I've already got more guilt
than I know what to do with.

238
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,409
You want a drink?

239
00:25:37,577 --> 00:25:39,411
No, I'm okay.

240
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:47,127
Shit.

241
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,691
Hey.

242
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:10,818
You okay?

243
00:26:12,362 --> 00:26:15,281
Yeah. I'm fine.

244
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,459
You know what?

245
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:31,755
It's Christmas Eve and...

246
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:38,971
And I have a couch,
so you can stay on it.

247
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:40,723
I'm gonna go take a bath.

248
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:44,643
Fix yourself something to eat
if you're hungry or anything.

249
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:48,147
There's nothing to steal, but don't be
a jerk and take something anyway.

250
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,566
No. I wouldn't.

251
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,446
- My name is Jack.
- No.

252
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,324
Let's not do the name thing,
because it's...

253
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,993
I don't wanna meet you.

254
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:05,247
I may wanna help you tonight,
but I don't wanna know you, really.

255
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,169
Okay.

256
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,366
What's this?

257
00:28:24,244 --> 00:28:27,871
Best I could do
with what was in the fridge.

258
00:28:36,423 --> 00:28:38,090
Thanks.

259
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:42,344
No problem.

260
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:51,061
- You want a drink?
- Yeah, sure.

261
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:20,007
It was pretty good, considering.

262
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:29,266
Your fridge has quite an array of things.

263
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:32,478
Not a lot of food, but...

264
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:34,772
- Freezer has a rock in it.
- What rock?

265
00:29:34,981 --> 00:29:39,151
There was a stone in it. It said "petal."

266
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:41,361
That's snooping.

267
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:51,705
It was my mom's senseless idea
of a nickname.

268
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:54,249
It's...

269
00:29:57,837 --> 00:30:01,298
So you're a waitress. I mean...

270
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:04,843
I don't know what I mean.

271
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:06,929
Okay.

272
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:30,035
I hate Christmas.

273
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,657
Hey.

274
00:32:31,824 --> 00:32:33,867
Hey, wake up. Jackie.

275
00:32:34,452 --> 00:32:36,161
- No.
- Who are these people?

276
00:32:36,329 --> 00:32:39,831
- What?
- Who are the people in this picture?

277
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:41,333
That's my mom and me.

278
00:32:42,293 --> 00:32:44,753
- What do you mean, your mom and...?
- No, wait a minute.

279
00:32:44,921 --> 00:32:47,923
- Where's your mother now?
- My mom is dead.

280
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:52,427
- What do you mean, she's dead?
- I mean, she's dead. Dead. Gone.

281
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:56,682
She passed out with a cigarette and
burned to death a long time ago, all right?

282
00:32:57,016 --> 00:32:58,850
No, no, no...

283
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,895
Listen, I'm sorry. Listen.

284
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:05,691
I don't know how...

285
00:33:06,693 --> 00:33:08,944
- What's the date today?
- What?

286
00:33:09,237 --> 00:33:11,154
I know this sounds crazy.

287
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,074
What year is this?

288
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:16,201
2007.

289
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:19,955
What? What?

290
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,583
Who the hell are you?

291
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,213
I'm Jack Starks.

292
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,091
Get the fuck out of my house.

293
00:33:31,634 --> 00:33:33,802
- What'd you do, snoop all over the place?
- No.

294
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:37,764
God, you had no right.
You had no right to go through anything.

295
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:39,850
Look at me.

296
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:43,937
I know this doesn't make any sense,
because it doesn't make sense to me either.

297
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:47,190
Oh, my God. If you don't get out now,
I'm gonna call the cops.

298
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,486
No, please. Please, wait.
I won't hurt you. Just talk to me, please.

299
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:56,533
I... Your mom was passed out
on the side of the road when I met you.

300
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,619
She was wasted.
Jean, her name was Jean.

301
00:33:59,787 --> 00:34:04,332
- Just stop it!
- Look, I gave this kid those dog tags.

302
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,378
No, no. No, you didn't.

303
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:12,424
Jack Starks did,
and Jack Starks is dead.

304
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,926
What?

305
00:34:15,094 --> 00:34:16,970
What do you mean, he's...?

306
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,722
He's dead.

307
00:34:18,931 --> 00:34:24,936
His body was found New Year's Day, 1993,
Alpine Grove.

308
00:34:25,104 --> 00:34:26,605
He's dead.

309
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:31,276
- It can't be.
- Well, it is.

310
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:37,199
Listen, listen. I don't care who
or where you think you are...

311
00:34:37,366 --> 00:34:38,909
you're not Jack Starks.

312
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:43,622
So whoever you are, I did a nice thing... I
did a really nice thing, and you've really...

313
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,667
God, you've really made me regret it,
so please, please, would you...?

314
00:34:47,835 --> 00:34:49,628
Would you just leave? Okay?

315
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:51,630
Don't you remember me?

316
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,924
- Oh, my God.
- Look at me.

317
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:58,678
I'll leave, okay, I'll leave, but look at me.
I'm not lying to you.

318
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:05,227
I met you. I met you and your mother,
and there was no one around for miles.

319
00:35:05,394 --> 00:35:09,940
I couldn't have known that from a pair
of dog tags you had lying around.

320
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,112
You put those down, and you get out.

321
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:19,699
Don't you remember me?

322
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:24,704
- Don't you know? I'm...
- You get out!

323
00:35:26,707 --> 00:35:28,416
I'm...

324
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:30,502
Okay?

325
00:35:38,636 --> 00:35:40,220
Please.

326
00:35:41,347 --> 00:35:42,556
Please get out.

327
00:36:02,952 --> 00:36:04,578
I'm gonna blow your head off!

328
00:36:09,584 --> 00:36:12,043
Jackie.

329
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,629
Oh, God.

330
00:36:19,427 --> 00:36:21,428
I can't believe you left him in all night.

331
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,346
You didn't say anything when I asked...

332
00:36:23,514 --> 00:36:27,309
I expected some common sense
on your part. Open the drawer.

333
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,320
Is he dead?

334
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:44,618
No. Get him upstairs immediately.
He's dehydrated.

335
00:36:44,785 --> 00:36:46,912
I want him on an IV
by the time I get up there.

336
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:49,456
I tried to tell you
when I came to your office...

337
00:36:49,624 --> 00:36:51,958
I expected you to take him out.

338
00:36:52,126 --> 00:36:57,088
You're a physician. I shouldn't have
to spell everything out for you.

339
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:11,353
Jack?

340
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,402
Tom.

341
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:24,032
Tom, can I speak with you
for a moment, please?

342
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:32,123
- What have you done with Jack Starks?
- What do you mean?

343
00:37:32,291 --> 00:37:35,502
- He's unconscious.
- He's recovering from Loxadol and Ativan.

344
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:38,838
Loxadol? He didn't need neuroleptics.

345
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:42,384
You know that from what, a couple
of two-minute stares across the room?

346
00:37:42,551 --> 00:37:45,345
He didn't need antipsychotics,
if that's all you gave him.

347
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,890
After he attacked me,
I figured he'd need a little placating.

348
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:51,017
You sure he wasn't provoked?

349
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,687
Are you sure you wanna make
an accusation like that?

350
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:58,858
I'm not making any accusations.
He's bruised up.

351
00:37:59,026 --> 00:38:01,278
Happens sometimes
when you gotta restrain them.

352
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:04,030
Listen to me.
He is not gonna end up like Ted Casey.

353
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:07,200
I don't know what you're trying to do,
but he's not a lab animal.

354
00:38:07,368 --> 00:38:10,120
You can't reprogram them,
no matter what cocktail of drugs...

355
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:14,040
You really don't let up, do you?
Just because you failed Ted Casey...

356
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,834
doesn't mean the rest of us did.

357
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:20,505
Now, if you'll excuse me,
it's Christmas, remember?

358
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:40,191
Hi, how are you? Sorry I'm late.

359
00:38:43,612 --> 00:38:46,698
- Hi, Babak.
- That's a nice wave.

360
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:49,200
- Hey, Jamile.
- Hey.

361
00:38:52,121 --> 00:38:55,665
Okay, that's great. That was the truck.
Now point to the ball.

362
00:39:00,463 --> 00:39:02,297
Very good.

363
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:07,469
Wanna hold it? Feels nice. Strong.

364
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:17,479
I need you to stay with me
for just a little while more, okay?

365
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,698
We'll get there.

366
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:32,118
Could I have some water?

367
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:36,539
Could I have some water?
I have some water?

368
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,833
Here you go.

369
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:49,969
What the hell kind of drugs
are you people giving me?

370
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,639
Just something to keep you calm.

371
00:39:54,266 --> 00:39:56,893
Did you just say something?

372
00:39:58,521 --> 00:40:01,106
I said, the drugs are to keep you calm.

373
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,025
Did you sleep well?

374
00:40:07,363 --> 00:40:10,907
- I wasn't asleep, was I?
- You were asleep for nearly a whole day.

375
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:15,161
It's December 26th, Jack.
How are you feeling?

376
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,622
- December 26th?
- That's right.

377
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:19,958
- 1992?
- Yes.

378
00:40:20,126 --> 00:40:22,961
And that's the sun, and you're on Earth.

379
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:26,381
And I know you know better, Jack.

380
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:30,844
Who the hell are you?
My mom is dead. 2007.

381
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:33,471
Jack Starks is dead.

382
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:36,015
Get out of here, get out!

383
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:38,560
- You left me in there.
- In where?

384
00:40:38,727 --> 00:40:43,106
You left me in that thing. In the drawer.
And then...

385
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,108
you put me in a straitjacket.

386
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:48,903
We were forced to use restraints,
if that's what you're referring to.

387
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:53,616
- It wasn't a fucking restraint.
- That's exactly what our equipment is.

388
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,202
Relax.

389
00:40:59,457 --> 00:41:02,041
Don't act like I don't know what's real.

390
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:06,504
You're suffering from delusions
as part of your condition.

391
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:08,214
No, I know what's real, I know.

392
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:12,093
You strapped me into something
and stuffed me in a fucking drawer.

393
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,805
It wasn't a dream.

394
00:41:15,973 --> 00:41:18,766
I don't know what you're trying to pull,
but I wasn't...

395
00:41:18,934 --> 00:41:21,144
I have to say...

396
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:25,607
this is the most resilient I've seen
a patient undergoing this treatment.

397
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:29,402
I had a patient a few years ago.
His name was Ted Casey.

398
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:34,073
Ted sodomized a 7-year-old girl.

399
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:39,162
His lawyers asked me to have a look at him
because after his deeds were done...

400
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:42,790
he climbed into the trees
of the forest where he killed her...

401
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,375
and howled like a dog.

402
00:41:44,543 --> 00:41:50,256
Ted never went to prison because everyone,
including me, believed he was sick.

403
00:41:50,424 --> 00:41:55,428
So he came here. Then one day a little girl
came with her mother to visit her relative...

404
00:41:55,638 --> 00:41:58,556
and I caught Ted stealing looks at her.

405
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:03,061
The kind you really have to steal,
if you know what I mean.

406
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,980
I asked Ted then...

407
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:12,320
if he could remember what the little
girl who he'd slain was wearing.

408
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:16,324
"Oh, yes," he said. " I remember it.

409
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,827
I remember it well."

410
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,122
Those were actually his last words.

411
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,461
What happened to your face?

412
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:34,259
I was careless. It won't happen again.

413
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:37,345
I'll say a prayer for you, Jack.

414
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,140
Maybe God will pick up
where the medicine leaves off.

415
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,435
You sure you know where to find him?

416
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,682
Jack.

417
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,684
What are you doing, Jack?

418
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:08,144
What are you gonna do to me?

419
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:11,773
I thought I'd just ask you
to come inside with me.

420
00:44:11,940 --> 00:44:16,986
- What if I didn't want to come?
- Well, I'd probably ask you why.

421
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,113
Because I'm not crazy.

422
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:23,242
You suffer from a delusional disorder.
It doesn't mean you're crazy.

423
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,495
It just means you're confused.

424
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,081
You're here instead of jail because
your condition...

425
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:32,752
- Played a role in your crime.
- I didn't kill that cop, but I don't remember.

426
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:36,714
Your mind's ability to distinguish
between your fantasies...

427
00:44:36,882 --> 00:44:38,758
and the real events that happened...

428
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:44,514
The real events that have happened to me
have been fucked up, not my mind.

429
00:44:47,976 --> 00:44:49,185
Jack.

430
00:44:51,355 --> 00:44:53,272
I'd like to ask you a question, if I may.

431
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:56,609
Since when do people around here
start asking for things?

432
00:44:57,611 --> 00:45:01,114
- Okay. Smoke?
- That's what you wanna ask?

433
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:05,201
No.

434
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:09,789
I wanted...

435
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:14,419
I wanted to ask you how your treatments
with Dr. Becker are progressing.

436
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:17,797
Fine. Fine.

437
00:45:18,215 --> 00:45:20,967
I hope you'd tell me
if that wasn't the case.

438
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:26,264
Why? Why, what would you do?
What would you do?

439
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:30,518
I would try to make it stop.

440
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:35,523
- I'm not sure I want him to stop.
- So it's helping?

441
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:41,612
They're making me feel like
a different person.

442
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:05,344
You coming?

443
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:09,849
We're gonna freeze out here, you and I.

444
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:19,108
Could get hurt if they catch you
trying to leave again.

445
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:33,039
What do you know about the shit
they do to us in the basement?

446
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:35,750
What shit?

447
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:38,252
- You know what I'm talking about.
- No, I don't.

448
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:42,381
Yeah, you do. That jacket.

449
00:46:49,223 --> 00:46:50,890
- What jacket?
- The fucking drawer.

450
00:46:51,058 --> 00:46:53,976
Now, stop playing games,
you know what I'm talking about.

451
00:46:56,605 --> 00:47:02,276
I know that they take you down there.
I know that they put you in it.

452
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:04,362
The rest of it, it's...

453
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:09,367
It's a trip, you know,
it's like a serious vacation.

454
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:11,452
I found out I'm gonna die.

455
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,956
Well, mortality is actually
a great thing to be familiar with.

456
00:47:15,123 --> 00:47:16,499
I'm gonna die in four days.

457
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:21,379
That's what I found out.
They find my body in four days.

458
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,424
What are you two yapping about?

459
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:31,639
We're talking about our ability
to go forward in time...

460
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:33,432
to go into the future.

461
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:39,438
I mean, that's what
we're talking about, right?

462
00:47:44,403 --> 00:47:46,445
Yeah, that's right.

463
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:56,914
If you need to find something out
when you're in there, just calm down.

464
00:47:57,082 --> 00:48:00,626
The less you freak,
the less you'll trip out.

465
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:05,298
Yeah, but all this shit from before
just comes tumbling...

466
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:08,217
Yeah, but that shit is in the past.

467
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:11,429
Focus on what you need to get now.

468
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:15,224
- I gotta get back in there.
- That could be a problem.

469
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:18,185
- Why?
- Lorenson's got her claws into it now.

470
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:24,734
When she started getting suspicious of me
was when they stopped putting me in there.

471
00:48:24,902 --> 00:48:27,028
Women.

472
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:29,947
What do you think I should do?

473
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:33,451
You could still give Becker an itch.

474
00:48:33,952 --> 00:48:36,245
You might get killed
when he goes to scratch it...

475
00:48:36,413 --> 00:48:39,498
but seems to me, you're saying
that's about to happen anyway...

476
00:48:40,459 --> 00:48:42,752
Oh, man.

477
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:47,173
Please continue, Mr. Mackenzie.

478
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:50,885
Okay.

479
00:48:55,766 --> 00:49:00,102
Well, I've been approached
by the Federal Trade Organization.

480
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:05,441
And what have they approached you about,
Mr. Mackenzie?

481
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,986
And this is nuts, but...

482
00:49:09,154 --> 00:49:13,282
they have asked me to head up...

483
00:49:14,034 --> 00:49:17,411
the Organization for the Organized.

484
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:22,917
- The Organization for the Organized?
- Yeah, you've heard of them?

485
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:25,461
No, Mr. Mackenzie, I have not.

486
00:49:25,629 --> 00:49:29,006
That's because there is
no such organization, you idiot.

487
00:49:29,383 --> 00:49:31,968
That is categorically not true.

488
00:49:32,177 --> 00:49:35,429
That is blatantly and manifestly not true.

489
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:37,556
They have asked me to lead them.

490
00:49:37,724 --> 00:49:41,227
And if you'd heard of them, then they
wouldn't be hush-hush, would they?

491
00:49:42,604 --> 00:49:44,230
What do the rest of you think?

492
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,573
Well...

493
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:58,953
- I know they exist.
- And how is that?

494
00:50:00,038 --> 00:50:04,208
When I was in the Gulf,
the Organization...

495
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:06,419
was recruiting the Organized.

496
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:09,505
- Is that a fact, Mr. Starks?
- It is a fact.

497
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:12,967
Because if it's not,
it doesn't help Mr. Mackenzie.

498
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:16,095
It is a fact. Bona fide and classified.

499
00:50:17,305 --> 00:50:19,515
I knew it. I knew it.

500
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:22,977
You know, those little fuckers
are everywhere.

501
00:50:23,603 --> 00:50:25,396
They only recruit the best, Mackenzie.

502
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:29,108
- Calm down, Mr. Starks.
- Stay calm, see, stay calm.

503
00:50:29,276 --> 00:50:32,403
Always ordering us to stay calm, be calm.

504
00:50:32,571 --> 00:50:36,240
Be calm. Be calm.
They order you to order me to be calm.

505
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:38,784
How are we supposed
to be calm? Look at this place.

506
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:42,246
So, people, wake up, okay?
Orders come from the top only.

507
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:45,166
Don't let them order you around.
Long live the Organization.

508
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:47,793
Long live the Organization
for the Organized.

509
00:50:47,961 --> 00:50:50,629
- Sit down, Mr. Starks.
- No, no, no, you've gotta listen...

510
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:54,008
Long live the Organization
for the Organized.

511
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,761
Join the Organization.
The Organization needs you.

512
00:50:56,928 --> 00:50:58,804
- Fight the good fight.
- You listen to him.

513
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:00,556
- You don't listen to me?
- Sit down.

514
00:51:00,724 --> 00:51:02,641
You gotta listen to him.

515
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:05,186
- Long live the Organization.
- Sit down.

516
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:07,063
Join the Organization.

517
00:51:12,527 --> 00:51:14,653
You gotta listen to him.

518
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,416
Oh, Starks...

519
00:51:27,584 --> 00:51:30,544
you are real stubborn.

520
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:32,296
But there's ways of fixing that.

521
00:51:35,217 --> 00:51:39,053
The less you freak,
the less you'll trip out.

522
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:41,430
Stay calm.

523
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:47,645
Criminally insane.

524
00:51:48,522 --> 00:51:51,065
Gentlemen, I'm gonna need you
to step out of the car...

525
00:51:51,233 --> 00:51:54,860
- With your hands in the air, please.
- What seems to be the problem, officer?

526
00:51:55,403 --> 00:51:59,448
Problem is you're moving too slow. Step out
of the car with your hands in the air.

527
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,034
Can I open the door here?

528
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:23,180
Hey, soldier boy, you awake?

529
00:52:24,933 --> 00:52:26,600
Didn't think so.

530
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:35,442
Yeah.

531
00:52:40,907 --> 00:52:44,326
It's okay. You're okay.

532
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:12,354
Hey, Jack, grab the ball.

533
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,407
Show Mom, honey.

534
00:54:05,033 --> 00:54:06,533
Will you give me one sec?

535
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:21,215
You got nerve showing up like this.

536
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:23,634
You mind?

537
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,313
Okay, here goes.

538
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:40,693
Jack Starks died from a wound
to the head, January 1 st, 1993.

539
00:54:41,111 --> 00:54:42,820
How? I mean, how do I die?

540
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,824
It didn't say.

541
00:54:48,201 --> 00:54:49,743
Does that mean you believe me?

542
00:54:50,704 --> 00:54:52,955
I don't know what I believe.

543
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:57,751
- What else you find out?
- Whole bunch of stuff.

544
00:54:57,919 --> 00:55:00,045
There was a doctor. Becker.

545
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:03,424
He was using some kind of behavior
modification on his patients...

546
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:05,050
that was banned in the ' 70s.

547
00:55:05,218 --> 00:55:07,845
And there was another doctor too,
a Dr. Lorenson.

548
00:55:08,013 --> 00:55:12,266
And something about a kid
she was treating. Babak.

549
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,143
- Don't know who that is.
- I don't know...

550
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:17,354
but the whole thing
was a major scandal.

551
00:55:17,522 --> 00:55:21,775
Becker claimed he was trying to create
a womb-like environment for his patients.

552
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:23,902
Fucking womb.

553
00:55:27,949 --> 00:55:30,117
It wasn't a fucking womb.

554
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:34,413
Look, I have to find out how I die.

555
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,625
Well, Alpine Grove still exists.

556
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:43,505
We could go see if there's anyone around
who might know what really happened.

557
00:55:47,302 --> 00:55:48,969
We could.

558
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:09,365
Thanks for doing this.

559
00:56:11,826 --> 00:56:13,827
Well, I must be the crazy one, right?

560
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:27,549
I'm sorry I can't tell you more
about your uncle's death.

561
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:29,635
They used the hospital medical examiner...

562
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:33,263
- "Blunt trauma" doesn't tell me anything.
- I'm sorry, that's all it says.

563
00:56:33,431 --> 00:56:37,267
I mean, weren't there doctors?
What about Dr. Becker or Dr. Lorenson...?

564
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:42,147
Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital.
She was here the same time as your uncle.

565
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:44,691
I'm sure she could be
of more help to you.

566
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:49,488
- And what about Becker and Hopkins?
- Dr. Hopkins died.

567
00:56:49,697 --> 00:56:52,241
And I'm not familiar with a Dr. Becker.

568
00:56:52,409 --> 00:56:56,120
Well, can you see if there'd be any kind
of forwarding address for Dr. Becker?

569
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:58,789
Is there some particular reason
for these questions?

570
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,460
He's the only family I remember.

571
00:57:12,554 --> 00:57:14,805
What does this guy keep smiling about?

572
00:57:14,973 --> 00:57:16,348
Hi. Beth Lorenson.

573
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:20,018
- How do you do?
- Nice to meet you.

574
00:57:20,186 --> 00:57:21,979
- Hi. Beth Lorenson.
- Jackie Price.

575
00:57:22,147 --> 00:57:24,064
Sit down, sit down.

576
00:57:30,822 --> 00:57:33,282
I'm sorry. You look exactly like him.

577
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,077
Did you know him well?

578
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:39,329
Your uncle was my most
memorable patient.

579
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:41,081
- Why is that?
- In the end...

580
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:44,293
he made me change my mind
about a lot of things.

581
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:48,547
- He actually helped me with a case of mine.
- Really? What case?

582
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:53,218
- I was working with a little boy.
- Babak Yazdi?

583
00:57:53,428 --> 00:57:55,721
- Yes.
- Who was he?

584
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:58,015
A friend's son.
How do you know about him?

585
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:01,935
We saw it when we were looking up
information about his uncle.

586
00:58:04,772 --> 00:58:06,398
How did he help?

587
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:13,864
Well, it's complicated, but in the end
he let me know how...

588
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:17,409
- I could get through to him.
- How?

589
00:58:18,870 --> 00:58:21,622
It's complicated.

590
00:58:23,541 --> 00:58:26,084
And it was a really long time ago.

591
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:31,882
Let me ask you something.
Do you know how my uncle died?

592
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:38,096
Yeah, I think it was from...

593
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:39,765
a head trauma.

594
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:43,060
Yes, but how? How did he get it?

595
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:46,271
I don't know.

596
00:58:51,152 --> 00:58:52,402
You don't?

597
00:58:58,034 --> 00:59:01,787
Think Dr. Becker might have
a better idea?

598
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:12,089
Yes, Dr. Becker would know more.

599
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,591
- I don't believe a word she just said.
- Me neither.

600
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:18,345
Come on. There's one last thing.

601
00:59:18,513 --> 00:59:24,017
To remind you of the staff softball game
at 4 p.m., so don't be late.

602
00:59:31,859 --> 00:59:33,193
Jack, what is this?

603
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:45,414
This is the room.

604
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:53,088
They used to hang it over there.

605
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:01,471
I'm actually in this drawer right now.

606
01:00:20,825 --> 01:00:23,702
You know what?
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.

607
01:00:23,870 --> 01:00:26,371
You folks ain't supposed
to be down here.

608
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:27,914
We were just leaving.

609
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:34,921
Do I know you from somewhere?

610
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,508
I don't know, do you?

611
01:00:39,385 --> 01:00:43,639
I don't know, you probably
know my uncle, Jack Starks?

612
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:47,851
Goddamn, that's right.

613
01:00:49,395 --> 01:00:51,313
- You're his spitting image.
- Yeah, I know.

614
01:00:51,481 --> 01:00:54,524
- You could be his ghost.
- Could be.

615
01:00:55,151 --> 01:00:58,195
- You remember him?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

616
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,238
He was a great guy.

617
01:01:02,408 --> 01:01:05,619
You wouldn't happen to know
how he died, now, would you?

618
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:09,748
I just remember them finding his body.

619
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:14,503
Is that all you remember, Damon?

620
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:20,759
How do you know my name?

621
01:01:21,928 --> 01:01:24,012
- I know all about you, Damon.
- Oh, yeah?

622
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,430
Oh, yeah.

623
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:29,351
- I know you're a piece of shit.
- I don't like you getting in my face...

624
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:31,687
- Was it you?
- Don't know what you're talking about.

625
01:01:31,854 --> 01:01:35,649
- He was hit in the head. Sounds like you.
- I never touched him, man, I swear.

626
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,070
What's going on?

627
01:01:41,072 --> 01:01:44,032
- See you, pal.
- This is a restricted area.

628
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,411
Damon. Damon, Damon, they're gone.

629
01:01:47,578 --> 01:01:49,037
It's time for your medication.

630
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:55,460
I'll see if I can track Becker down.

631
01:01:57,338 --> 01:01:58,547
How long do we have?

632
01:02:00,133 --> 01:02:02,008
I don't know.

633
01:02:04,095 --> 01:02:06,471
I don't think we have
that much time. Come on.

634
01:02:08,683 --> 01:02:10,350
Well...

635
01:02:11,185 --> 01:02:13,395
then you get yourself to me tomorrow.

636
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:20,819
You don't...

637
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:23,864
and I'll take it personally.

638
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:28,952
Oh, yeah?

639
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:59,232
Do you want a drink?

640
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,265
I'm running out of time.

641
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:36,770
I don't care. You have to come back.

642
01:03:37,688 --> 01:03:40,774
I didn't ask for you. But now...

643
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:43,360
you just have to come back.

644
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:47,364
It's not like that.
I don't have control over it.

645
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:49,115
Well...

646
01:03:49,575 --> 01:03:51,576
get control.

647
01:04:28,114 --> 01:04:29,865
Come back to me, Jack.

648
01:05:16,203 --> 01:05:18,496
I can't help you unless you let me.

649
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:25,337
- That thing is my only chance in this place.
- What thing?

650
01:05:25,504 --> 01:05:27,505
You don't understand.

651
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:30,592
Well, try and help me understand.

652
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:43,271
I've...

653
01:05:43,814 --> 01:05:47,067
I've seen a time that's not this time.

654
01:05:48,903 --> 01:05:51,947
And I'm only able to see it
when I'm in there.

655
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:58,328
What time is that?

656
01:06:01,540 --> 01:06:03,291
2007.

657
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:09,422
What year do you think it is now?

658
01:06:09,590 --> 01:06:14,552
- I'm not delusional. I know it's 1992.
- Okay.

659
01:06:14,720 --> 01:06:17,430
So tell me about 2007.
What does it look like?

660
01:06:19,225 --> 01:06:23,436
- Doesn't look that different.
- The future doesn't look different?

661
01:06:25,231 --> 01:06:27,107
No.

662
01:06:27,274 --> 01:06:28,942
Not to people like me.

663
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:30,777
You think you're traveling in time?

664
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:32,195
- Is that it?
- Listen.

665
01:06:32,363 --> 01:06:35,240
- Not everyone in this place is crazy.
- Like who?

666
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:38,159
Like Mackenzie, maybe?

667
01:06:39,453 --> 01:06:41,871
Did he tell you
he tried to kill his wife?

668
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:45,417
Mackenzie locked himself up
in his house for two months...

669
01:06:45,584 --> 01:06:48,294
and nearly starved himself
before he was brought here.

670
01:06:48,462 --> 01:06:51,798
All because his wife left him
for another man.

671
01:06:52,717 --> 01:06:56,219
I don't care. Look, I don't have time
for this. I gotta get out of here.

672
01:06:56,387 --> 01:06:58,388
These are all facets of your delusions.

673
01:07:02,226 --> 01:07:03,768
Oh, yeah?

674
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:11,109
What about Babak? Is that a facet?

675
01:07:13,988 --> 01:07:15,447
How do you know about him?

676
01:07:16,574 --> 01:07:17,991
You told me.

677
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,662
I saw you.

678
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:26,916
You thought I knew something about him,
so you told me.

679
01:07:27,668 --> 01:07:29,377
How do you know about him, Jack?

680
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:33,298
Because you told me. You told me.

681
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:42,015
I know somewhere inside of you...

682
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:44,976
you have to believe
that what I'm saying is true.

683
01:07:47,229 --> 01:07:48,480
You have to.

684
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:56,738
I don't know how you know
about Babak...

685
01:07:59,283 --> 01:08:02,035
but these ideas are
part of your delusions.

686
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:05,179
No.

687
01:08:20,471 --> 01:08:21,971
Hey.

688
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:24,307
I brought you some smokes.

689
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:31,731
Lorenson said that your wife...

690
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:35,235
left you for another man,
so you lost it.

691
01:08:39,782 --> 01:08:41,199
How's that for a thank-you?

692
01:08:44,620 --> 01:08:46,204
Well?

693
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:48,915
I didn't want to see it. You know?

694
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,543
I'm in here because...

695
01:08:51,710 --> 01:08:55,630
they say I have a nervous condition.

696
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:58,842
Well, well, here's my question:

697
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:03,388
Who wouldn't be nervous if they
really, really looked at their lives?

698
01:09:03,556 --> 01:09:06,558
I mean, whose life is that good?

699
01:09:12,815 --> 01:09:14,899
Rise and shine, Harold.

700
01:09:15,067 --> 01:09:18,570
Jamile? Have you told anybody about
my sessions with Babak?

701
01:09:18,737 --> 01:09:21,030
- Of course not.
- Has anyone been asking about him?

702
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:23,741
No. I would have told you.

703
01:09:27,329 --> 01:09:31,624
Well, hello there.
How you doing today?

704
01:09:32,960 --> 01:09:34,836
You ready to work?

705
01:09:39,592 --> 01:09:41,176
Okay.

706
01:10:03,657 --> 01:10:07,785
Jackie.

707
01:10:25,262 --> 01:10:26,721
Hey.

708
01:10:27,139 --> 01:10:30,808
- Okay, this is really freaking me out.
- Tell me about it.

709
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:37,690
- Oh, God. You want this?
- I want this.

710
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:41,903
- Hey.
- Hey.

711
01:10:42,821 --> 01:10:45,031
God, I should get the heat going.

712
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:49,327
- Oh, I found out about the little boy.
- Yeah?

713
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:53,373
Babak? Lorenson used a mild form
of electroshock therapy...

714
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:55,500
which disrupted his seizures.

715
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:58,169
She didn't even know that's what
he was having before.

716
01:10:58,379 --> 01:11:00,588
That's what you have to tell her about.

717
01:11:00,756 --> 01:11:04,592
I think Becker's house is around here
somewhere. I marked it on the map.

718
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:07,095
- I think this is it.
- You sure?

719
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:11,516
Yeah. I called the number yesterday
to make sure.

720
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:16,896
All right, let's go.

721
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:32,036
Hi there.

722
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:33,788
You looking for Dr. Becker?

723
01:12:04,862 --> 01:12:06,612
There he is.

724
01:12:30,137 --> 01:12:33,973
How's that work?
God doesn't remember?

725
01:12:34,141 --> 01:12:35,725
Is that it?

726
01:12:37,853 --> 01:12:41,773
- Can I help you?
- I don't know, can you?

727
01:12:44,026 --> 01:12:47,695
- Do I know you?
- I think you do.

728
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:52,283
- You're his son?
- Nope.

729
01:12:52,785 --> 01:12:54,494
Not his son.

730
01:12:58,082 --> 01:13:00,333
What's the matter, doc?

731
01:13:00,501 --> 01:13:02,835
You look like you've seen a ghost.

732
01:13:04,505 --> 01:13:07,256
But how can you be...?

733
01:13:07,883 --> 01:13:12,470
- He died years ago in the hospital.
- Yeah, you killed him. Didn't you?

734
01:13:13,180 --> 01:13:17,308
No, I didn't kill him. The treatment
might've pushed him to kill himself...

735
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:20,228
No, I didn't kill myself.
I died from a blow to the head.

736
01:13:22,606 --> 01:13:24,524
How did that happen?

737
01:13:26,693 --> 01:13:31,406
All I can remember from the last time
we put him in there...

738
01:13:32,491 --> 01:13:36,869
he... You came out and
said their names to me.

739
01:13:37,037 --> 01:13:38,621
What names?

740
01:13:39,164 --> 01:13:40,748
People I tried to help.

741
01:13:43,919 --> 01:13:45,545
Who were they?

742
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:48,214
Nathan Piechowski...

743
01:13:49,299 --> 01:13:50,716
Jackson MacGregor...

744
01:13:52,344 --> 01:13:53,678
Ted Casey.

745
01:13:55,722 --> 01:13:58,057
I didn't ask for them, any of you.

746
01:14:00,144 --> 01:14:02,895
- You were criminals sent to me.
- We were patients.

747
01:14:03,063 --> 01:14:05,398
We were patients.

748
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:06,816
You were criminals...

749
01:14:06,984 --> 01:14:12,029
Hold on a second. So you said I came out
of that thing, and I told you those names?

750
01:14:12,781 --> 01:14:15,700
Well, who do you think
told me about them?

751
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:19,954
You did.

752
01:14:22,833 --> 01:14:25,585
I'm in that drawer right now.

753
01:14:27,504 --> 01:14:29,547
I don't understand.

754
01:14:29,965 --> 01:14:32,383
You're haunting yourself, old man.

755
01:14:32,593 --> 01:14:35,219
- I didn't put you in Alpine Grove.
- No.

756
01:14:35,429 --> 01:14:38,306
You pumped me full of drugs...

757
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:40,766
and you stuffed me
in a morgue drawer.

758
01:14:40,934 --> 01:14:43,352
With every intention of helping you.

759
01:14:45,939 --> 01:14:48,191
And that justifies it?

760
01:14:58,952 --> 01:15:01,287
We're all dead, Jack.

761
01:15:11,673 --> 01:15:13,257
What is it?

762
01:15:13,967 --> 01:15:15,718
- I have to sit down.
- Is everything okay?

763
01:15:15,886 --> 01:15:20,223
- I have to sit down.
- Jack, what is it? Jack?

764
01:15:21,642 --> 01:15:23,726
He's taking me out of there.

765
01:15:29,316 --> 01:15:31,275
- He said it was the last time.
- What?

766
01:15:31,443 --> 01:15:35,863
- Jackie, he said it was the last time. Go.
- Oh, my God.

767
01:15:36,031 --> 01:15:37,907
- What was your address?
- What?

768
01:15:38,075 --> 01:15:40,618
When you were a kid, when we met...

769
01:15:40,786 --> 01:15:42,787
what was your address?

770
01:15:42,955 --> 01:15:45,665
2140 Waldemere Way.

771
01:15:51,672 --> 01:15:55,466
2140... 2140...

772
01:16:05,352 --> 01:16:08,479
- Jackie.
- Jack. Jack, stay with me.

773
01:16:08,689 --> 01:16:11,816
It's the last time. The last time.

774
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:20,992
Jack.

775
01:16:33,338 --> 01:16:35,339
I saw you.

776
01:16:35,966 --> 01:16:40,386
I know what you did to your patients.

777
01:16:40,637 --> 01:16:42,430
Years from now, I saw you.

778
01:16:42,889 --> 01:16:45,057
You told me about Piechowski...

779
01:16:45,225 --> 01:16:48,060
and Jackson MacGregor...

780
01:16:48,228 --> 01:16:51,814
and Ted Casey. You told me.

781
01:16:55,902 --> 01:16:57,528
All those guys stay with you.

782
01:16:57,696 --> 01:17:00,698
All of us. We all stay with you.

783
01:17:01,742 --> 01:17:04,368
We haunt you, haunt you.

784
01:17:08,915 --> 01:17:11,042
All of us.

785
01:17:12,919 --> 01:17:15,671
We haunt you.

786
01:17:24,598 --> 01:17:26,140
We haunt you.

787
01:18:08,308 --> 01:18:11,435
Could I...? Could I have some paper?

788
01:18:11,603 --> 01:18:14,855
Paper and a pen.
Need to write something.

789
01:18:16,233 --> 01:18:18,901
Listen, your patient, Babak...

790
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:21,070
is having seizures.

791
01:18:21,238 --> 01:18:23,406
That's why he hasn't learned
to speak properly.

792
01:18:23,573 --> 01:18:24,824
Who told you this?

793
01:18:24,991 --> 01:18:29,453
Just telling you something you already
know. You just haven't figured it out yet.

794
01:18:30,414 --> 01:18:33,666
He's not slow, he's having seizures.

795
01:18:34,376 --> 01:18:36,961
Electro...

796
01:18:37,129 --> 01:18:40,214
Electroconvulsion therapy.

797
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:42,466
You used it on him.

798
01:18:43,510 --> 01:18:45,010
That's how you reset him.

799
01:18:45,178 --> 01:18:48,514
No one would ever use ECT on a child.

800
01:18:49,015 --> 01:18:52,852
I don't know that he is having seizures.
If he is, that could send him into status.

801
01:18:53,019 --> 01:18:55,479
It's a permanent state of seizure.

802
01:19:04,865 --> 01:19:06,115
No, no.

803
01:19:06,283 --> 01:19:10,286
Babak is my friend's son.
I would never risk that.

804
01:19:12,748 --> 01:19:14,582
You will.

805
01:19:19,129 --> 01:19:21,547
Can you just grab the end of that for me?

806
01:19:24,259 --> 01:19:27,052
I've... I've given him a sedative.

807
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:32,725
Okay.

808
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:46,363
I'm only gonna do it once.

809
01:19:57,959 --> 01:20:00,211
The settings are very, very low.

810
01:20:01,087 --> 01:20:03,547
- Are you gonna stay in the room?
- Yeah.

811
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:08,093
Okay, great. If you could just
apply some pressure.

812
01:20:09,262 --> 01:20:10,763
Good.

813
01:20:11,765 --> 01:20:13,474
I'm just gonna press this button.

814
01:20:13,642 --> 01:20:15,810
I'm just gonna set it a little bit lower.

815
01:20:15,977 --> 01:20:20,648
Okay, now I'm at the lowest possible.

816
01:20:27,072 --> 01:20:28,531
Okay.

817
01:20:47,926 --> 01:20:49,176
Here we go.

818
01:21:01,022 --> 01:21:03,524
Okay. We're done, that's it.

819
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:06,068
We're done. Okay, it's over.

820
01:21:06,653 --> 01:21:08,863
All right. He's all right. He's all right.

821
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:11,699
Okay. Okay.

822
01:21:13,743 --> 01:21:14,994
Babak?

823
01:21:19,332 --> 01:21:20,791
Babak...

824
01:21:22,586 --> 01:21:24,253
how are you doing?

825
01:21:24,713 --> 01:21:26,046
Can you say hi, Babak?

826
01:21:28,174 --> 01:21:29,967
Hi, Babak.

827
01:21:38,894 --> 01:21:41,353
You're okay, you're okay.

828
01:22:12,469 --> 01:22:14,470
What do you need me to do?

829
01:22:15,013 --> 01:22:17,056
I need to take this to someone.

830
01:22:17,223 --> 01:22:19,975
This is a secure unit.
There's no way I can do that.

831
01:22:20,143 --> 01:22:23,020
You have to. Please.

832
01:22:23,188 --> 01:22:26,398
- How long do you need?
- Just a couple hours.

833
01:22:26,733 --> 01:22:28,817
I'm gonna die tonight.

834
01:22:29,527 --> 01:22:31,528
It's been decided.

835
01:22:39,371 --> 01:22:41,372
You want me to come in with you?

836
01:22:42,082 --> 01:22:43,791
I'll be okay.

837
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:22,413
Hey.

838
01:23:22,831 --> 01:23:24,790
I remember you.

839
01:23:25,208 --> 01:23:27,251
I remember you too.

840
01:23:28,878 --> 01:23:31,338
- Come in, it's cold out there.
- Yeah.

841
01:23:43,643 --> 01:23:46,895
God. How've you been, Jackie?

842
01:23:47,355 --> 01:23:51,150
- Okay.
- Yeah? How's your mom?

843
01:23:52,986 --> 01:23:55,946
Well, okay.

844
01:23:56,656 --> 01:23:58,991
Do you think I could talk to her?

845
01:23:59,617 --> 01:24:03,245
Hey, Mom. Mom?

846
01:24:09,502 --> 01:24:12,004
- Hey, Jean.
- Hey.

847
01:24:16,634 --> 01:24:17,843
Do I know you?

848
01:24:18,011 --> 01:24:20,637
Mom, this is the guy that fixed the car.

849
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:23,140
The guy you yelled at.

850
01:24:23,558 --> 01:24:24,933
Okay.

851
01:24:30,106 --> 01:24:31,565
There something you need?

852
01:24:32,692 --> 01:24:34,485
It's something you need.

853
01:24:40,658 --> 01:24:43,577
Jackie, go play in the snow.

854
01:24:44,329 --> 01:24:45,913
- Why?
- Just do it.

855
01:24:55,340 --> 01:24:56,757
Okay.

856
01:25:01,888 --> 01:25:03,972
I don't know how to make this
not sound crazy.

857
01:25:05,892 --> 01:25:09,895
I know it's not gonna make
a lot of sense right now...

858
01:25:11,314 --> 01:25:13,107
but...

859
01:25:16,194 --> 01:25:20,864
Look. Everything that I want
to tell you is in this letter.

860
01:25:21,574 --> 01:25:23,992
And it's really...

861
01:25:24,160 --> 01:25:27,704
It's very important
that you believe it, because...

862
01:25:28,915 --> 01:25:33,794
Because it just would be a shame
if you didn't, you know?

863
01:25:42,595 --> 01:25:43,804
Okay, I'll read it.

864
01:25:46,558 --> 01:25:47,766
That it?

865
01:25:47,976 --> 01:25:50,269
Yeah, that's it.

866
01:26:04,868 --> 01:26:06,285
Hey.

867
01:26:08,288 --> 01:26:10,247
Petal...

868
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:11,832
it's nice.

869
01:26:12,083 --> 01:26:14,334
Don't stop calling her that.

870
01:26:15,795 --> 01:26:17,921
I think she likes it.

871
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:33,562
Hey.

872
01:26:40,778 --> 01:26:42,446
Hey, wait.

873
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:53,165
You be good, all right, Jackie?

874
01:26:55,376 --> 01:26:57,628
- Okay.
- Okay.

875
01:28:06,906 --> 01:28:08,949
Jack? Jack?

876
01:28:09,659 --> 01:28:11,285
You okay?

877
01:28:11,911 --> 01:28:13,537
Stay with me.

878
01:28:15,623 --> 01:28:17,416
Put me in the jacket.

879
01:28:17,583 --> 01:28:18,917
What do you mean?

880
01:28:19,085 --> 01:28:24,006
You have to put me in the jacket,
it's the only way. I gotta get in there.

881
01:28:30,930 --> 01:28:33,390
Jack? Jack, come on.

882
01:28:33,558 --> 01:28:35,892
I need you to help me get you inside.

883
01:28:36,728 --> 01:28:38,270
Okay.

884
01:28:38,771 --> 01:28:40,230
You ready?

885
01:28:41,607 --> 01:28:44,401
- All right, you got it?
- I got it.

886
01:28:58,916 --> 01:29:01,043
- That was it.
- Justin!

887
01:29:01,210 --> 01:29:03,045
Put me in the jacket.

888
01:29:03,629 --> 01:29:06,214
- What happened?
- He slipped. He slipped on the ice.

889
01:29:06,382 --> 01:29:08,925
- Let's get him up. Watch his head.
- The jacket.

890
01:29:09,302 --> 01:29:11,136
What are you talking about?

891
01:29:12,055 --> 01:29:14,765
He said we have to get him
into the jacket.

892
01:29:15,183 --> 01:29:17,476
I know the procedure,
but we can't do this to him.

893
01:29:17,643 --> 01:29:19,186
Do whatever you did with Becker.

894
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:22,564
I was 27 years old the first time I died.

895
01:29:24,067 --> 01:29:26,610
I remember there was white everywhere.

896
01:29:27,111 --> 01:29:30,113
There was war, and I felt alive.
But, really, I was dead.

897
01:29:34,577 --> 01:29:36,578
Sometimes I think
we live through things...

898
01:29:36,746 --> 01:29:40,123
only to be able to say that it happened.

899
01:29:40,750 --> 01:29:43,543
That it wasn't to someone else.
It was to me.

900
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:48,507
Sometimes we live to beat the odds.

901
01:29:51,928 --> 01:29:53,637
I'm not crazy...

902
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:56,223
even though they thought I was.

903
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:59,351
I live in the same world as everyone else.

904
01:29:59,519 --> 01:30:03,355
I just saw more of it.
As I'm sure you have.

905
01:30:05,942 --> 01:30:08,485
They'll find my body tomorrow.

906
01:30:09,278 --> 01:30:11,947
You can check it out
if you don't believe me.

907
01:30:13,950 --> 01:30:16,493
I've seen life after my death...

908
01:30:18,788 --> 01:30:21,748
and I'm telling you this
because it's the only way...

909
01:30:21,916 --> 01:30:25,419
to help you and your daughter
have a better life of your own.

910
01:30:36,264 --> 01:30:37,931
Jean...

911
01:30:38,391 --> 01:30:41,852
you're gonna pass out one day
smoking a cigarette...

912
01:30:42,019 --> 01:30:43,895
and burn to death.

913
01:30:45,231 --> 01:30:49,693
Your daughter grows up living
the same sad life you're living right now.

914
01:30:50,528 --> 01:30:53,697
And she misses you so much.

915
01:31:10,214 --> 01:31:15,051
Sometimes life can only really begin
with the knowledge of death.

916
01:31:16,345 --> 01:31:20,307
That it can all end,
even when you least want it to.

917
01:31:32,487 --> 01:31:35,697
The important thing in
life is to believe...

918
01:31:35,865 --> 01:31:38,033
that while you're alive.
It's never too late.

919
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:41,411
I promise you, Jean.
No matter how bad things look...

920
01:31:41,579 --> 01:31:44,539
they look better awake
than they do asleep.

921
01:31:45,374 --> 01:31:48,543
When you die, there's only one thing
you want to happen.

922
01:31:49,670 --> 01:31:51,254
You wanna come back.

923
01:31:51,422 --> 01:31:54,799
Mommy, Daddy, is it time to get up?

924
01:31:55,051 --> 01:31:58,053
He can't find four of us here.
Come on, go in the kitchen.

925
01:32:02,183 --> 01:32:04,226
Oh. Boy.

926
01:33:37,903 --> 01:33:40,238
- Hey, you okay?
- I'm fine.

927
01:33:40,906 --> 01:33:42,657
You have a nasty cut there.

928
01:33:42,908 --> 01:33:44,618
Yeah, yeah.

929
01:33:44,994 --> 01:33:47,454
I slipped, but I'm alive.

930
01:33:52,168 --> 01:33:55,170
I'm on my way to the hospital.
Could I give you a ride?

931
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:58,423
Yeah, I'd love that.

932
01:34:00,259 --> 01:34:03,470
Okay. Get in.

933
01:34:04,096 --> 01:34:06,931
All right. Thanks.

934
01:34:41,842 --> 01:34:44,052
I'm sorry, one sec.

935
01:34:46,138 --> 01:34:47,597
Hey.

936
01:34:49,266 --> 01:34:51,976
That's sweet. Have a good time, okay?

937
01:34:52,645 --> 01:34:56,022
Yeah, yeah. Listen, Mom,
now's not actually a great time to talk.

938
01:34:56,190 --> 01:35:00,110
I'm on my way to work.
Yeah, I'll call you later.

939
01:35:01,529 --> 01:35:04,030
All right. Happy New Year.

940
01:35:07,618 --> 01:35:10,787
- Sorry about that.
- That's all right.

941
01:35:11,664 --> 01:35:13,665
No problem there.

942
01:35:16,919 --> 01:35:18,461
How you doing?

943
01:35:19,964 --> 01:35:21,631
Better now.

944
01:35:30,516 --> 01:35:32,726
How much time do we have?

945
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:36,078
