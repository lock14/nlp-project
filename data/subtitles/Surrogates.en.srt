1
00:00:32,043 --> 00:00:34,745
Look at yourselves.

2
00:00:35,328 --> 00:00:38,948
Unplug from your chairs,
get up and look in the mirror.

3
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:43,111
What you see is how God made you.

4
00:00:44,286 --> 00:00:48,036
We're not meant to experience the
world through a machine.

5
00:00:56,536 --> 00:01:00,001
14 years ago.

6
00:01:01,281 --> 00:01:04,500
What you're telling me is -
a monkey is operating this arm

7
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:06,392
with nothing but his thoughts?

8
00:01:06,512 --> 00:01:07,815
Absolutely.

9
00:01:11,354 --> 00:01:13,305
There are 100 sensors,

10
00:01:13,425 --> 00:01:16,338
each listening to a different brain cell
or neuron.

11
00:01:19,617 --> 00:01:22,706
Physicaly disabed people
will be able to operate

12
00:01:22,827 --> 00:01:25,302
fully synthetic bodies.

13
00:01:25,423 --> 00:01:28,088
It provides a tremendous amount of hope for the future.

14
00:01:28,652 --> 00:01:30,356
11 years ago.

15
00:01:32,415 --> 00:01:34,976
Because of the technology that
we have, at a time of war

16
00:01:35,097 --> 00:01:37,087
we're going to start seeing this more and more.

17
00:01:37,206 --> 00:01:41,223
As manufacturing capacity expanded for military/industrial use

18
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:44,067
Surrogates became affordable to the general public

19
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,570
Causing a revolution in how
in how we live.

20
00:01:47,483 --> 00:01:50,902
The ability to leave your home
without risk of disease or injury

21
00:01:51,396 --> 00:01:54,723
To have perfect looks without trips to the gym
or plastic surgery

22
00:01:54,993 --> 00:01:58,012
There is no question that at some
point they will be persons like anyone else

23
00:01:58,133 --> 00:02:01,116
They will not be human, but that they will be part
of our community?

24
00:02:01,391 --> 00:02:02,896
There is no question
in my mind.

25
00:02:03,177 --> 00:02:05,529
The decision came down 5 to 4

26
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:09,429
That the Supreme Court ruled in favor
of the use of surrogates in daily life.

27
00:02:14,179 --> 00:02:16,940
Right now, we are witnessing an
event

28
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,221
That is of an evolutionary significance

29
00:02:19,341 --> 00:02:21,337
7 years ago.

30
00:02:22,135 --> 00:02:25,309
According to VSI, the industries
leading manufacturer,

31
00:02:25,562 --> 00:02:28,017
over 98% of world population

32
00:02:28,137 --> 00:02:31,439
uses a surrogate in all
facets of their daily life

33
00:02:34,682 --> 00:02:39,495
We're in the midst of profound changes that are things
that were once unimaginable have become inevitable

34
00:02:39,975 --> 00:02:42,269
Since the global embrace of surrogacy

35
00:02:42,466 --> 00:02:44,638
crime rates have dropped
to record lows

36
00:02:45,034 --> 00:02:47,872
We have witnessed and incredible
reduction in violent crime

37
00:02:48,258 --> 00:02:50,618
communicable disease and discrimination.

38
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:53,440
Problems that have plagued
societies for centuries

39
00:02:53,770 --> 00:02:55,407
solved almost overnight.

40
00:02:55,527 --> 00:02:57,015
We are the creators.

41
00:02:57,259 --> 00:02:59,281
We will be making them

42
00:02:59,401 --> 00:03:01,171
Do everything for us.  All in one machine.

43
00:03:01,443 --> 00:03:03,361
3 years ago.

44
00:03:04,403 --> 00:03:07,308
But there is a minority who
actively oppose Surrogates

45
00:03:07,428 --> 00:03:09,386
And are moving to limit their use.

46
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,780
Many people will see this

47
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:17,400
as the invasion of the inhuman.

48
00:03:18,512 --> 00:03:21,493
They've established reservations or
Surrogacy free zones

49
00:03:21,613 --> 00:03:23,768
in major cities around the country.

50
00:03:28,253 --> 00:03:29,861
They are led by Zaire Powell

51
00:03:29,981 --> 00:03:31,967
or as he is better known
to his followers

52
00:03:32,087 --> 00:03:33,020
The Prophet.

53
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,544
Those machines walking around out there

54
00:03:35,664 --> 00:03:37,124
They're a lie.

55
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:43,715
You have been sold a lie.

56
00:03:43,949 --> 00:03:45,764
Currently.

57
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,697
You're going to love Tosca

58
00:03:56,818 --> 00:03:59,791
-Alright, but don't tell me how it ends.
- The way they all end.

59
00:03:59,911 --> 00:04:01,907
Everyone dies.

60
00:04:03,732 --> 00:04:06,741
I'm so glad you could
come back east for a visit.

61
00:04:07,005 --> 00:04:09,477
Well... anything for a break from exams.

62
00:04:10,258 --> 00:04:11,546
We're almost there.

63
00:04:11,971 --> 00:04:14,058
Listen... thanks for lending it to me.

64
00:04:14,529 --> 00:04:15,995
Have a wonderful time.

65
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,102
I love you.

66
00:04:18,364 --> 00:04:20,019
I love you too Dad.

67
00:04:28,596 --> 00:04:30,307
You know Armando

68
00:04:30,505 --> 00:04:32,188
I'm not really in the mood for opera

69
00:04:33,577 --> 00:04:34,705
Four Point?

70
00:04:35,965 --> 00:04:37,393
You read my mind.

71
00:06:26,193 --> 00:06:27,753
Get lost meat bag

72
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:15,162
I'm agent Peters.

73
00:07:15,878 --> 00:07:18,275
This is Agent Greer... FBI.

74
00:07:18,802 --> 00:07:22,422
Yeah... some jackass on a motorcycle
wiped out a bunch of units

75
00:07:22,542 --> 00:07:24,004
So what do you need us for?

76
00:07:24,332 --> 00:07:26,966
Well I was going to file just a vandalism report

77
00:07:27,086 --> 00:07:29,213
but it turns out this unit's unregistered.

78
00:07:36,418 --> 00:07:38,429
Looks like it's going to need new optics

79
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,197
No shit

80
00:07:53,302 --> 00:07:55,408
The memory chip is completely fried.

81
00:07:56,285 --> 00:07:57,471
Whatya got on the girl?

82
00:07:57,591 --> 00:07:59,840
Registered to a
Cameron McAllister.

83
00:08:00,921 --> 00:08:02,228
He file a report?

84
00:08:02,472 --> 00:08:05,180
No, that's just it, no calls, no nothin'

85
00:08:19,585 --> 00:08:20,854
Come on.

86
00:08:21,344 --> 00:08:23,347
Let's go talk to
our operator.

87
00:08:34,773 --> 00:08:35,742
Cam?

88
00:08:37,607 --> 00:08:39,196
Maybe nobody's home.

89
00:08:44,189 --> 00:08:45,863
My Surries in for an upgrade

90
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,227
and they gave me this crappy loaner.

91
00:08:47,347 --> 00:08:48,391
Could you?

92
00:08:48,983 --> 00:08:49,659
Certainly.

93
00:08:58,744 --> 00:08:59,769
Cam?

94
00:09:01,997 --> 00:09:05,711
Cam's a good tenant you know,
pays the rent on time, never leaves the apartment.

95
00:09:21,856 --> 00:09:23,266
Cam?

96
00:09:24,902 --> 00:09:26,558
Cam?

97
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:29,651
[Screams] Oh my God!

98
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:33,851
Don't touch anything, please.

99
00:09:42,422 --> 00:09:44,011
I'll call it in.

100
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:48,129
- You're sure this is Cameron McAllister?
- Yes!

101
00:09:54,910 --> 00:09:58,014
This is Agent Peters, we
tracked down the operator.

102
00:10:00,422 --> 00:10:01,119
Yeah

103
00:10:02,961 --> 00:10:04,287
Better send a coroner

104
00:10:08,962 --> 00:10:10,627
Connection interrupted.

105
00:10:12,611 --> 00:10:14,163
Have you ever seen anything like this?

106
00:13:10,782 --> 00:13:11,873
Morning

107
00:13:13,266 --> 00:13:14,074
Where's your....

108
00:13:14,629 --> 00:13:16,032
In the... charge room.

109
00:13:29,033 --> 00:13:30,641
You pull another all nighter?

110
00:13:31,675 --> 00:13:32,512
Yes I did

111
00:13:35,577 --> 00:13:37,204
Why don't you think about taking a break?

112
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:39,357
- A break?
- Mmmmhmmm

113
00:13:40,298 --> 00:13:42,094
I got some vacation time saved up

114
00:13:42,593 --> 00:13:43,758
How about Hawaii?

115
00:13:44,417 --> 00:13:45,930
Lisa said she got an amazing deal

116
00:13:46,157 --> 00:13:47,068
Hawaii would be great

117
00:13:47,188 --> 00:13:51,478
She had this totally buff Surrie in Maui,
She took it surfing, parasailing, deep sea diving.

118
00:13:52,131 --> 00:13:54,219
You know that rental place on Boilston?

119
00:13:54,324 --> 00:13:57,661
I was thinking about US.
You and me going away some place together.

120
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:00,074
And leave our units at home?
Are you kidding?

121
00:14:03,288 --> 00:14:07,179
- We could take a drive out to the Cape? We haven't done that for a while...
- Could talk about this another time?

122
00:14:07,962 --> 00:14:11,581
You now I should get to work, the shops
been really busy, everyone wants me to look for somewhere and...

123
00:14:15,009 --> 00:14:17,069
Yeah... I was just thinking that...
Ummm...

124
00:14:19,203 --> 00:14:20,660
It just feels like we...

125
00:14:22,359 --> 00:14:25,998
- Haven't really spent much time together lately.
- We're together every day.

126
00:14:28,744 --> 00:14:30,821
Surrogates...
Not the same...

127
00:14:33,769 --> 00:14:35,037
It's better.

128
00:14:46,664 --> 00:14:50,688
College West, San Diego.

129
00:14:51,787 --> 00:14:53,415
Yo Canter?

130
00:14:53,724 --> 00:14:55,049
He's been in there all weekend.

131
00:14:55,613 --> 00:14:57,260
He's gonna miss the Psych final.

132
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:03,271
Jesus!

133
00:15:03,685 --> 00:15:05,124
Someone call the cops!

134
00:15:06,515 --> 00:15:09,129
We are confronted by an unprecedented situation.

135
00:15:10,899 --> 00:15:13,663
Two people have died while
connected to their stim chairs.

136
00:15:14,951 --> 00:15:18,985
According to the pathologist,
their brains were liquefied in their skulls.

137
00:15:20,203 --> 00:15:22,356
What ever happened to
their surrogates, killed them.

138
00:15:24,453 --> 00:15:25,328
Sir?

139
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,308
- How's it even possible?
- We don't know.

140
00:15:29,737 --> 00:15:31,731
I'm imposing a total media blackout.

141
00:15:32,015 --> 00:15:36,464
No one in this office is going to be responsible
for setting off a nationwide panic.

142
00:15:37,789 --> 00:15:41,532
The public cannot be allowed to get the idea
that using a surrogate can be fatal.

143
00:15:46,536 --> 00:15:49,036
Tuxedo boys last moments.

144
00:15:51,378 --> 00:15:52,920
Get lost meat bag.

145
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:59,015
- Looks like we got ourselves a witness.
- Mmmmhmm.

146
00:16:05,933 --> 00:16:07,071
Hang on...

147
00:16:11,734 --> 00:16:13,926
- What is that?
- Exactly...

148
00:16:17,348 --> 00:16:19,670
- Some kind of weapon.
- Anything yet?

149
00:16:20,356 --> 00:16:24,052
Hang on to yourself, I think
we may actually have a homicide here.

150
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:26,869
Come here and look at this.

151
00:16:26,989 --> 00:16:28,468
- Are you serious?
- No we don't know that for sure.

152
00:16:28,787 --> 00:16:32,482
Yeah but what if it is a homicide?
When was the last one?

153
00:16:33,536 --> 00:16:34,861
This could be huge.

154
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,318
- Yeah, Lee go.
- We got your next of kin.

155
00:16:41,553 --> 00:16:43,085
I hope you're sitting down.

156
00:16:43,455 --> 00:16:45,739
The kids father is Lionel Canter.

157
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:48,626
As in the inventor of surrogates, Lionel Canter.

158
00:16:51,496 --> 00:16:54,871
Jarid Canter, son of Dr. Lionel Canter was found dead

159
00:16:54,991 --> 00:16:57,542
In his Southern California
dormitory this morning

160
00:16:57,663 --> 00:16:59,705
Cause of death
remains unknown.

161
00:16:59,825 --> 00:17:02,168
A college sophmore, Jarid
was the only son

162
00:17:02,288 --> 00:17:05,432
of the man known around the world
as the father of surrogacy.

163
00:17:06,177 --> 00:17:07,840
The Former Chairman of VSI

164
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:11,272
Shaped it into one of the largest
corporations in the world.

165
00:17:11,391 --> 00:17:14,393
However, a split between
Canter and his VSI partners

166
00:17:14,513 --> 00:17:16,378
Over the direction of the company

167
00:17:16,498 --> 00:17:18,822
Led to Canters firing
seven years ago.

168
00:17:19,461 --> 00:17:22,865
Publicly humiliated and forced out
of the company he helped to build

169
00:17:23,298 --> 00:17:26,203
Canter has since remained
absent from the public eye.

170
00:17:28,253 --> 00:17:29,860
Dr. Canter's expecting you.

171
00:17:30,396 --> 00:17:31,853
He actually lives here?

172
00:17:31,974 --> 00:17:32,936
I didn't say that.

173
00:17:33,459 --> 00:17:35,425
You'll be speaking with
one of his surrogates.

174
00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:40,521
I work for Dr. Canter.

175
00:17:41,705 --> 00:17:43,400
His private elevator is this way.

176
00:17:59,253 --> 00:18:01,434
Please, wait in here.

177
00:18:05,245 --> 00:18:06,609
What a nice place.

178
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,630
It should be.

179
00:18:09,815 --> 00:18:12,213
It's a piece of every surrogate they sell.

180
00:18:20,277 --> 00:18:21,217
Dr. Canter?

181
00:18:21,678 --> 00:18:22,533
That's right.

182
00:18:22,966 --> 00:18:24,282
You're with the FBI?

183
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,049
Yes we are.

184
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:27,636
This way.

185
00:18:28,670 --> 00:18:31,076
I can't help but notice the similarities between

186
00:18:31,196 --> 00:18:34,208
your surrogate... and the
one your son Jared was using.

187
00:18:35,105 --> 00:18:37,756
I never really knew
Jarid as a child.

188
00:18:39,209 --> 00:18:42,246
He grew up with his mother in California
Who kept him from me.

189
00:18:43,054 --> 00:18:46,486
When he went to college I encourage him
to borrow my surrogates whenever he wanted.

190
00:18:46,607 --> 00:18:48,160
How did you managed to do that?

191
00:18:48,455 --> 00:18:50,758
A Surrie has to be coded
to your neural signature.

192
00:18:51,152 --> 00:18:53,588
I am not exactly your
average VSI consumer.

193
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,869
This was just a way for me
to spend time with my son.

194
00:19:00,990 --> 00:19:04,564
It's a felony to inhabit a surrogate
registered to another operator.

195
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:08,382
No offense Dr. Canter.
We're just trying to straighten out our facts.

196
00:19:09,091 --> 00:19:10,172
What is this?

197
00:19:11,036 --> 00:19:13,171
- Some kind of Good Cop, Bad Cop routine?
- No sir.

198
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:14,582
- You tryin' to handle me?
- No sir.

199
00:19:14,779 --> 00:19:16,293
Because I'm not going to be handled.

200
00:19:16,565 --> 00:19:17,637
Dr Canter...

201
00:19:18,173 --> 00:19:20,383
- I know how you must feel.
- Do you?

202
00:19:21,191 --> 00:19:22,291
Yes, sir.

203
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,102
I lost a son myself.

204
00:19:36,467 --> 00:19:39,334
Do you have any idea why
someone might want to harm Jared?

205
00:19:45,613 --> 00:19:46,365
No.

206
00:19:47,343 --> 00:19:48,283
Or yourself?

207
00:19:53,987 --> 00:19:55,182
Oh my God.

208
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,492
If it was me they were after...

209
00:20:00,027 --> 00:20:02,282
I'm responsible for my sons death.

210
00:20:10,401 --> 00:20:13,344
Well... I guess the interview's over.

211
00:20:33,018 --> 00:20:33,968
[Sobbing]
No!

212
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:41,049
 Robotic surrogates combine
the durability of machines

213
00:20:41,169 --> 00:20:43,732
With the grace and beauty
of the human form

214
00:20:44,024 --> 00:20:45,725
To make your life safer

215
00:20:45,932 --> 00:20:46,891
And better.

216
00:20:47,101 --> 00:20:49,395
Whether you're....

217
00:20:50,525 --> 00:20:54,182
 Get ready to live your life without any
risk or danger.

218
00:20:54,787 --> 00:20:57,317
 You can live your life
without limitations.

219
00:20:58,304 --> 00:21:00,814
 And become anyone you want to be.

220
00:21:00,935 --> 00:21:03,589
 From the comfort and
safety of your own home.

221
00:21:03,867 --> 00:21:06,350
 VSI, where it all began.

222
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,866
 Do what you want.
Be what you want.

223
00:21:11,418 --> 00:21:13,410
Agents Greer and Peters?
I'm Victor Welsh.

224
00:21:13,848 --> 00:21:15,372
VP of corporate relations.

225
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:17,205
Please Sit.

226
00:21:17,563 --> 00:21:20,552
- Thanks for taking the time to see us.
- No problem.

227
00:21:21,570 --> 00:21:23,779
You uh... You must know Andy Stone?

228
00:21:24,015 --> 00:21:25,387
Our immediate superior.

229
00:21:25,507 --> 00:21:26,967
Do give him my regards.

230
00:21:27,278 --> 00:21:30,343
- We're from the legal department.
- Hope you don't mind if we sit in.

231
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,341
Not at all.

232
00:21:31,461 --> 00:21:35,027
The two of you might be interested in a free software
upgrade we're offering all law enforcement officials.

233
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,854
Better night vision.
Improved pursuit capability.

234
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:43,359
You have any idea how a surrogates
head would explode from the inside?

235
00:21:46,970 --> 00:21:49,791
Mr. Welsh isn't qualified
to answer that question.

236
00:21:49,998 --> 00:21:51,484
What do the operators say?

237
00:21:51,842 --> 00:21:52,886
Not much.

238
00:21:53,534 --> 00:21:54,483
They're dead.

239
00:21:54,604 --> 00:21:58,696
If you're trying to imply a link between VSI
products and an operators accidental death...

240
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,079
I'm not implying anything.

241
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:04,697
I just want to know how an operator
can be killed by signals from it's surrogate.

242
00:22:04,817 --> 00:22:06,408
This idea itself is absurd.

243
00:22:06,528 --> 00:22:09,690
If it were possible it would defeat
the entire purpose of surrogacy.

244
00:22:10,147 --> 00:22:12,912
Surries have jumped from bridges...
Been shot....

245
00:22:13,316 --> 00:22:15,911
Even... blown to bits without the
least bit of harm to their operators.

246
00:22:16,654 --> 00:22:18,402
The failsafes always kick in.

247
00:22:18,650 --> 00:22:22,485
I can assure you VSI's products have the most
stringent safety standards in the industry.

248
00:22:22,955 --> 00:22:24,423
What about a human head?

249
00:22:25,448 --> 00:22:26,999
What would cause one of them to blow up?

250
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:28,607
Agent Greer...

251
00:22:29,247 --> 00:22:29,971
We're not doctors.

252
00:22:31,005 --> 00:22:31,832
Honey...

253
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:33,666
I don't know WHAT you are.

254
00:22:34,597 --> 00:22:39,130
I mean for all I know you could be some big fat dude
sitting in a stim chair with his dick hanging out.

255
00:22:58,530 --> 00:23:00,316
Interesting technique.

256
00:23:01,175 --> 00:23:02,604
I hate lawyers.

257
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,466
[Click]

258
00:23:08,895 --> 00:23:10,089
What are you doing?

259
00:23:25,701 --> 00:23:26,999
Mr. Steinberg?

260
00:23:28,362 --> 00:23:30,073
Seth Steinberg?

261
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:34,555
Hello.

262
00:23:34,752 --> 00:23:35,731
Sorry.

263
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:37,009
I was in the can.

264
00:23:37,129 --> 00:23:39,407
Agent Peters, I'm Agent Greer with the FBI.

265
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:40,957
Really?

266
00:23:44,344 --> 00:23:46,197
You know with any chip this damaged...

267
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,801
Every circuit must have fired off at once.

268
00:23:49,149 --> 00:23:50,239
Kablooey!

269
00:23:50,841 --> 00:23:52,835
Have you ever seen anything like this before?

270
00:23:53,114 --> 00:23:57,025
Last week a truck load of GI Joes
did come back for re-conditioning.

271
00:23:57,505 --> 00:24:00,128
And a couple of the
Surries were missing optics.

272
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,008
Mind if we take a look at them?

273
00:24:16,995 --> 00:24:18,359
Here we go.

274
00:24:29,747 --> 00:24:32,483
No bullet holes?
No blast damage?

275
00:24:33,284 --> 00:24:35,710
No scratches.
No dirt. No mud.

276
00:24:36,114 --> 00:24:38,211
Mind if I check out the identity chip?

277
00:24:39,142 --> 00:24:40,759
- Heh. Yeah.
- Why not?

278
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:42,188
Didn't come back with one.

279
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:03,958
I'm down!

280
00:25:04,246 --> 00:25:05,083
I'm down.

281
00:25:05,516 --> 00:25:08,440
Damn things aren't free Polaski!
Take the snipers from behind this time.

282
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,446
Yes sir!

283
00:25:10,998 --> 00:25:12,285
Back online.

284
00:25:26,961 --> 00:25:28,099
Follow me.

285
00:25:29,126 --> 00:25:31,238
- Keep an eye on Bravo Company.
- Go kick some ass sir!

286
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,069
Agent Greer you're wasting
your time with these questions.

287
00:25:34,795 --> 00:25:38,688
Why on earth would the Defense Department want to develop
a weapon that could wipe out our own troops?

288
00:25:39,488 --> 00:25:41,397
So no such weapon exists...

289
00:25:41,517 --> 00:25:43,502
If it did, I'd know about it.

290
00:25:43,956 --> 00:25:45,640
And the soldier that we saw?

291
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,883
We routinely remove motherboards
and optics for analysis.

292
00:25:50,641 --> 00:25:51,742
Now if you'll excuse me.

293
00:25:52,146 --> 00:25:53,857
I've got to move a Peace Keeping operation.

294
00:26:00,976 --> 00:26:02,941
- Check your screen
- What?

295
00:26:03,061 --> 00:26:04,155
Myles Strickland.

296
00:26:04,275 --> 00:26:04,935
Who?

297
00:26:05,055 --> 00:26:07,172
Myles Strickland, beat that!

298
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:10,924
I did a run on criminal records

299
00:26:11,044 --> 00:26:12,165
Guess what I found?

300
00:26:12,286 --> 00:26:14,130
He's already in the system.

301
00:26:14,394 --> 00:26:17,506
He was arrested a month ago
for multiple counts of armed robbery.

302
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,913
And what's really weird about this...

303
00:26:20,533 --> 00:26:23,024
After he was busted...
They let him off.

304
00:26:23,617 --> 00:26:25,507
Someone on the inside's protecting him.

305
00:26:25,779 --> 00:26:27,792
But I put out an APB anyway.

306
00:26:43,370 --> 00:26:45,129
Visual matching.

307
00:26:57,423 --> 00:27:00,318
- Cameras caught your guy.
- Where?

308
00:27:00,438 --> 00:27:02,462
Dorchester, Gore Park and Adams.

309
00:27:02,582 --> 00:27:04,288
Not far from the reservation.

310
00:27:04,487 --> 00:27:06,639
Boston PD is on its way.

311
00:27:07,175 --> 00:27:08,793
Stay here.
Keep tabs on him.

312
00:27:08,913 --> 00:27:10,495
Wait a minute where are you going?

313
00:27:10,693 --> 00:27:12,160
Dorchester.

314
00:27:13,235 --> 00:27:14,777
It wasn't too difficult.

315
00:27:14,897 --> 00:27:17,870
I put his face in the system and... Bingo!
We found him in an alley.

316
00:27:18,632 --> 00:27:20,907
K33 over there brought it to my attention.

317
00:27:21,151 --> 00:27:22,411
Thanks Jerry.

318
00:27:23,792 --> 00:27:25,408
He's one of our best watchers.

319
00:27:25,776 --> 00:27:27,054
He's semi-retired.

320
00:27:27,421 --> 00:27:29,565
So he gets to work out of
his beach house in Maine.

321
00:27:29,903 --> 00:27:32,357
- Pretty sweet huh?
- Yeah, it's a nice setup you have here.

322
00:27:32,696 --> 00:27:34,980
Yeah, we can access every
Surrie on the grid here.

323
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:37,326
Touch a button.

324
00:27:37,683 --> 00:27:39,574
I can tap into anyone's feed.

325
00:27:40,187 --> 00:27:42,256
It's kinda like being inside Gods head.

326
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:46,158
[Burps]
Ooooooh Boy... I felt that one coming.

327
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,489
My name's Saunders by the way.

328
00:27:50,354 --> 00:27:51,671
Jennifer Peters.

329
00:27:52,205 --> 00:27:54,641
Yeah... Yeah you are aren't you?

330
00:27:55,943 --> 00:27:57,307
- Can I ask you a question?
- Hmmm?

331
00:27:58,425 --> 00:27:59,601
Why no surrogate?

332
00:27:59,986 --> 00:28:00,963
Me?
[Laughs]

333
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,682
They've been trying to puppet me for years.

334
00:28:04,743 --> 00:28:07,019
But they ain't built a machine
that can handle this big puppy yet.

335
00:28:07,694 --> 00:28:09,265
[Alarm Sounds]
Excuse me a second...

336
00:28:11,296 --> 00:28:13,072
We have an assault and
battery in progress.

337
00:28:13,193 --> 00:28:15,291
I need warrants to shut
them down immediately.

338
00:28:15,736 --> 00:28:18,086
Charlie 4639er.

339
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:20,560
Sierra 7855

340
00:28:20,945 --> 00:28:24,358
Let's see if they have a
security camera in the hotel...

341
00:28:26,248 --> 00:28:27,499
Looks like there is one.

342
00:28:29,962 --> 00:28:31,486
Warrant recieved.

343
00:28:32,116 --> 00:28:33,338
Agent Peters...

344
00:28:33,855 --> 00:28:35,039
Watch this.

345
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:36,396
Boom.

346
00:28:36,814 --> 00:28:37,857
Boom.

347
00:28:39,071 --> 00:28:41,063
Since when have you been
able to cut off operators?

348
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:43,970
It's brand new software.
I call it buffering.

349
00:28:44,089 --> 00:28:46,047
Let's me disconnect anyone
from their surrogate.

350
00:28:46,168 --> 00:28:47,907
Well that can't be legal?

351
00:28:48,027 --> 00:28:49,524
Ahhh... It's a grey area.

352
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,518
They don't ask, we don't tell.

353
00:28:52,872 --> 00:28:53,792
It's pretty cool huh?

354
00:28:54,187 --> 00:28:55,334
Awww C'mon.

355
00:28:56,204 --> 00:28:58,263
Relax, we're the
good guys.

356
00:29:11,981 --> 00:29:17,934
Suspect on a bike heading east of
South Hampton up a mile from the Res'

357
00:29:18,054 --> 00:29:22,174
Greer, be careful, you're heading straight towards
Dread territory.  We don't have jurisdiction to fly over there.

358
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:23,597
It's restricted air space.

359
00:29:24,603 --> 00:29:25,994
Greer are you there?

360
00:30:26,607 --> 00:30:27,556
Freeze!

361
00:30:34,044 --> 00:30:35,633
What was that?

362
00:30:39,898 --> 00:30:41,430
Agghhh!!!

363
00:32:18,592 --> 00:32:20,417
Fire! Fire!

364
00:34:14,373 --> 00:34:16,790
I ain't done nothin'!
I ain't done nothin'!

365
00:34:18,762 --> 00:34:20,105
Give me the bag.

366
00:34:22,024 --> 00:34:23,142
Throw it over here.

367
00:34:24,825 --> 00:34:26,528
Throw it over here.
Now!

368
00:34:55,113 --> 00:34:56,560
You're an abomination.

369
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,488
Oh god.

370
00:35:25,223 --> 00:35:27,114
Maggie.

371
00:35:28,525 --> 00:35:29,897
Maggie!

372
00:35:32,072 --> 00:35:34,668
Lionel Canter is on the phone.
He's called for Greer a half dozen times.

373
00:35:34,788 --> 00:35:36,332
I can't deal with this right now.

374
00:35:36,452 --> 00:35:38,909
- He's pretty upset.
- Just tell him someone will call him back.

375
00:35:39,028 --> 00:35:39,698
Peters!

376
00:35:40,329 --> 00:35:42,220
You gotta believe me
I tried to stop him.

377
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:44,402
Well you didn't try hard enough.
You're done for the day.

378
00:35:44,522 --> 00:35:45,407
Clock out.

379
00:36:17,597 --> 00:36:19,420
Oh you're kidding!

380
00:36:25,692 --> 00:36:26,708
God.

381
00:36:28,451 --> 00:36:29,128
Tom?

382
00:36:31,347 --> 00:36:32,259
Oh my God!

383
00:36:32,476 --> 00:36:33,821
Call an ambulance!

384
00:36:49,859 --> 00:36:51,373
Myles Strickland is it?

385
00:36:53,206 --> 00:36:54,645
Why are you...

386
00:37:02,478 --> 00:37:03,728
What's goin' on?

387
00:37:03,848 --> 00:37:04,828
Who was it?

388
00:37:05,439 --> 00:37:06,877
Who gave you the weapon?

389
00:37:07,507 --> 00:37:08,880
And paid you to use it?

390
00:37:10,348 --> 00:37:11,392
I don't know!

391
00:37:11,512 --> 00:37:13,150
Myles you can't lie to me.

392
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:14,720
I'm not lyin'.

393
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,535
I swear to God sir, I'm not lying.

394
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,690
He never told me his name.

395
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:20,665
We talked on disposable cell phones.

396
00:37:20,785 --> 00:37:22,198
I never saw
his face.

397
00:37:22,715 --> 00:37:25,367
I couldn't tell you who he
was if my life depended on it!

398
00:37:29,346 --> 00:37:31,254
A Police chase through Dorchester concluded

399
00:37:31,374 --> 00:37:34,188
with an FBI helicopter crash landing

400
00:37:34,414 --> 00:37:36,586
inside Bostons' Dread Reservation

401
00:37:36,706 --> 00:37:39,200
Residents of the Reservation are outraged

402
00:37:39,321 --> 00:37:40,902
over what they're calling

403
00:37:41,022 --> 00:37:44,455
a gross violation of their territorial sovereignity.

404
00:37:44,575 --> 00:37:46,740
Human Coalition Leader, The Prophet

405
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:50,430
responded in a statement made earlier today.

406
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:52,274
They've attacked us.

407
00:37:52,574 --> 00:37:56,242
Declared War on our way of
life and left us with one option:

408
00:37:56,735 --> 00:37:57,835
Revolution!

409
00:37:58,118 --> 00:38:01,822
We did not throw the first stone.
But we will throw the last.

410
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:09,820
Hi.

411
00:38:11,822 --> 00:38:12,641
Hey.

412
00:38:14,502 --> 00:38:15,640
How's the headache?

413
00:38:16,355 --> 00:38:17,623
Still there.

414
00:38:19,907 --> 00:38:22,032
- Thanks for being here.
- Of course.

415
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:24,476
Imagine a World where
children are always safe.

416
00:38:25,228 --> 00:38:26,874
 a world where every child

417
00:38:26,994 --> 00:38:29,130
 and every parent is secure.

418
00:38:29,805 --> 00:38:32,239
 Make every childhood a happy one.

419
00:38:33,264 --> 00:38:34,910
 Surrogates for kids.

420
00:38:35,183 --> 00:38:39,052
 Exclusively from VSI.
Where it all Beg...

421
00:38:44,377 --> 00:38:46,771
- Knock Knock.  Hey.
- Andy.  Hi.

422
00:38:47,345 --> 00:38:48,426
Oh my gosh.

423
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,897
- I haven't seen you forever.
- I know.

424
00:38:51,017 --> 00:38:52,562
I should let you guys talk.

425
00:38:52,681 --> 00:38:55,015
- Will you be okay?
- Mmmhmm

426
00:38:56,623 --> 00:38:57,836
See you tomorrow morning.

427
00:38:58,813 --> 00:38:59,734
Bye.

428
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:00,832
Bye.

429
00:39:06,446 --> 00:39:07,547
How bad?

430
00:39:07,969 --> 00:39:10,151
The doctor said you're
lucky to be alive.

431
00:39:10,653 --> 00:39:12,195
Good thing you unplugged.

432
00:39:13,944 --> 00:39:15,496
You gotta go get him.

433
00:39:15,937 --> 00:39:17,546
Stricklands got that weapon.

434
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:19,315
You just get a court order...

435
00:39:19,436 --> 00:39:22,109
There won't be any court
orders, you've been suspended.

436
00:39:22,635 --> 00:39:23,406
For what?

437
00:39:23,526 --> 00:39:26,875
- Tom, you violated our treaty with the Dreads.
- Forget the Treaty!

438
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,346
He killed 5 cops!

439
00:39:28,467 --> 00:39:31,326
Look... I'm gonna take care
of this case myself personally.  Alright?

440
00:39:32,229 --> 00:39:36,723
Now... I'm afraid the bureau won't be able to supply
you with a new surrogate until after the official inquiry.

441
00:39:37,627 --> 00:39:39,431
Same goes for your
gun and your badge.

442
00:39:40,212 --> 00:39:41,744
Don't think about this now.

443
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,436
He killed 5 cops Andy.

444
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:56,124
Take some time to heal.

445
00:40:29,028 --> 00:40:29,753
Hey.

446
00:40:30,533 --> 00:40:32,268
- Hey.
- Sorry I'm late.

447
00:40:32,373 --> 00:40:33,312
That's ok.

448
00:40:35,863 --> 00:40:37,574
Wow... You look a lot
like your synth.

449
00:40:38,175 --> 00:40:38,899
Yeah

450
00:40:39,755 --> 00:40:40,667
Should we go?

451
00:40:47,456 --> 00:40:50,117
How long has it been since you've
been out without a Surrie?

452
00:40:51,019 --> 00:40:52,486
I can't even remember.

453
00:40:56,917 --> 00:40:59,371
I can't believe they didn't give
you something for the axiety.

454
00:41:14,721 --> 00:41:15,502
Greer?

455
00:41:16,414 --> 00:41:17,880
- Look... This isn't gonna work.
- I'm fine.

456
00:41:18,667 --> 00:41:19,974
I have an idea.

457
00:41:43,985 --> 00:41:45,443
Come on... This is
a really bad idea...

458
00:41:45,659 --> 00:41:47,916
It's gonna be alright.  I'm sure
we'll find you something decent.

459
00:41:56,619 --> 00:41:59,224
Now we're gonna have you
back on your feet in a sec.

460
00:42:01,516 --> 00:42:02,823
Sync looks good.

461
00:42:03,095 --> 00:42:04,599
It's responding well to signal, right?

462
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,796
It feels numb.

463
00:42:08,106 --> 00:42:09,433
It's only a base model.

464
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:11,031
It comes with vision and hearing.

465
00:42:11,151 --> 00:42:13,157
If you want other senses
they're extra.

466
00:42:13,412 --> 00:42:16,843
Of course if you like seeing your own
face when you look in the mirror, no problem.

467
00:42:17,332 --> 00:42:19,664
I'll just scan your head, cast the thermo plastic

468
00:42:19,785 --> 00:42:21,413
and you're good to go
in less than an hour.

469
00:42:21,646 --> 00:42:23,375
Hey no charge on the improvements.

470
00:42:23,977 --> 00:42:25,868
I'm sure you wouldn't mind taking yourself back

471
00:42:25,988 --> 00:42:28,388
5, 10 years, huh?
What do you think of that?

472
00:42:29,224 --> 00:42:30,597
- Hmmm?
- I think we're done here.

473
00:42:36,709 --> 00:42:37,509
Greer.

474
00:42:44,615 --> 00:42:45,574
Tom.

475
00:42:46,409 --> 00:42:47,244
Tom.

476
00:42:47,954 --> 00:42:50,690
Tom you can't come out
here by yourself.  It's not safe.

477
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:52,551
- I'm fine.
- Let me take you home.

478
00:42:52,671 --> 00:42:54,465
I'm not going home.

479
00:42:54,969 --> 00:42:57,230
Tom.  We gotta forget the case.

480
00:42:57,596 --> 00:42:59,806
Stone is going to run things his way

481
00:42:59,927 --> 00:43:02,363
and as far as we're concerned, it's over.

482
00:43:02,483 --> 00:43:05,467
It's not over until we
get that weapon back.

483
00:43:07,386 --> 00:43:08,910
Then you gotta let me help you.

484
00:43:11,637 --> 00:43:13,820
I'm not gonna let you win.

485
00:43:13,940 --> 00:43:15,455
Take care of yourself Peters.

486
00:44:04,104 --> 00:44:06,952
Death came to Myles Strickland

487
00:44:08,316 --> 00:44:11,071
As death comes to all men.

488
00:44:12,106 --> 00:44:13,356
But for Myles

489
00:44:14,484 --> 00:44:16,007
It's not an ending.

490
00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:19,316
It's a new beginning.

491
00:44:21,018 --> 00:44:24,723
When you sacrifice your
own personal desires

492
00:44:26,633 --> 00:44:28,137
for a greater cause, a greater good.

493
00:44:29,746 --> 00:44:31,213
You never die.

494
00:44:32,444 --> 00:44:34,090
You never disappear.

495
00:44:35,187 --> 00:44:37,820
That is what it means to be human.

496
00:44:39,381 --> 00:44:41,082
There is no alternative

497
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:44,552
You can try to escape by
living through a puppet

498
00:44:45,177 --> 00:44:46,908
Through a machine.

499
00:44:47,565 --> 00:44:51,676
But deep down inside, you
know you're living a lie

500
00:44:53,884 --> 00:44:56,169
Here, inside these walls

501
00:44:56,373 --> 00:44:58,255
We understand the truth.

502
00:45:04,707 --> 00:45:08,421
We sacrifice many modern
pleasures and conveniences

503
00:45:08,541 --> 00:45:10,687
to feel truly connected.

504
00:45:11,853 --> 00:45:13,320
Not with machines

505
00:45:15,808 --> 00:45:16,965
But with ourselves.

506
00:45:22,173 --> 00:45:24,120
This is the human condition.

507
00:45:24,409 --> 00:45:26,600
This is what gives life meaning.

508
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:28,537
My friends.

509
00:45:28,979 --> 00:45:32,627
Soon the day will come
when surrogacy must end.

510
00:45:33,333 --> 00:45:35,269
That day, I promise you

511
00:45:35,951 --> 00:45:37,201
Is close at hand.

512
00:45:37,859 --> 00:45:40,830
The day... we get a second chance.

513
00:46:11,008 --> 00:46:12,100
Excuse me.

514
00:46:13,971 --> 00:46:15,352
- Can I help you?
- Yeah

515
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:17,543
I'd like to speak to
The Prohet for a minute.

516
00:46:17,806 --> 00:46:19,263
You and everybody else bud, no.

517
00:46:19,592 --> 00:46:21,247
You some kind of cop or somethin'?

518
00:46:21,727 --> 00:46:23,278
You have no jurisdiction here.

519
00:46:23,398 --> 00:46:25,347
Can I talk to you
about Myles Strickland please?

520
00:46:30,604 --> 00:46:31,599
Enough.

521
00:46:35,173 --> 00:46:37,693
It's different when you actually feel the pain.

522
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,234
Isn't it?

523
00:46:41,444 --> 00:46:43,108
What happened to Strickland?

524
00:46:45,216 --> 00:46:46,794
Was he a friend of yours?

525
00:46:47,312 --> 00:46:48,402
He had a weapon.

526
00:46:48,844 --> 00:46:50,554
A very dangerous weapon.

527
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,485
My people will do
anything to get this back.

528
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:01,821
[Laughs]
Well... if I happen to come
across such a weapon

529
00:47:03,090 --> 00:47:05,855
I promise to have it
delivered to your door.

530
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:09,334
Show him to the gates.

531
00:47:11,103 --> 00:47:12,202
Gently.

532
00:47:55,693 --> 00:47:56,769
Agent Greer.

533
00:47:57,361 --> 00:47:59,167
May I offer you a ride?

534
00:48:02,747 --> 00:48:04,608
You'll have to excuse my appearance.

535
00:48:04,974 --> 00:48:07,570
It's not safe for me to
use my usual surrogates.

536
00:48:09,093 --> 00:48:10,042
Dr. Canter.

537
00:48:10,163 --> 00:48:12,017
This is one of VSI's newer models.

538
00:48:13,061 --> 00:48:14,453
How long have you been following me?

539
00:48:14,573 --> 00:48:18,082
Long enough to know you're getting
nowhere solving my sons murder.

540
00:48:21,404 --> 00:48:23,124
You lost a child Agent Greer?

541
00:48:24,714 --> 00:48:25,475
How?

542
00:48:29,058 --> 00:48:30,561
Car accident.

543
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:37,232
It was just an accident.

544
00:48:38,952 --> 00:48:39,968
I'm sorry.

545
00:48:44,929 --> 00:48:48,606
I can think of no worse tragedy
than a parent outliving a child.

546
00:48:53,064 --> 00:48:54,465
All I can tell you

547
00:48:55,970 --> 00:48:57,822
is that the man who killed your son is dead.

548
00:48:58,564 --> 00:49:00,107
His name was Myles Strickland.

549
00:49:00,861 --> 00:49:02,384
Lived on the Res'.

550
00:49:04,396 --> 00:49:05,928
He was killed by his own people.

551
00:49:06,511 --> 00:49:07,537
And that's it?

552
00:49:08,045 --> 00:49:09,107
Case solved?

553
00:49:10,297 --> 00:49:12,545
One man didn't act on his own.

554
00:49:13,815 --> 00:49:15,329
Whatever killed my son

555
00:49:15,449 --> 00:49:18,543
was an extraordinary
sophisticated technology.

556
00:49:18,845 --> 00:49:21,327
Far beyond the capabilites of the Dreads.

557
00:49:21,949 --> 00:49:24,787
We're talking about a
billion dollar weapons project.

558
00:49:25,662 --> 00:49:27,956
Who do you know spends money like that?

559
00:49:38,055 --> 00:49:40,867
Focus on the weapon, where it came from.

560
00:49:58,225 --> 00:49:59,542
Mmmm do me.

561
00:50:05,641 --> 00:50:07,551
How was it?

562
00:50:17,813 --> 00:50:20,296
- Hey Maggie?
- No, thank you.

563
00:50:20,738 --> 00:50:22,525
Come on... it'll take the edge off.

564
00:50:31,826 --> 00:50:33,640
Tom?
Honey?

565
00:50:38,053 --> 00:50:39,717
I thought you were still in the hospital?

566
00:50:40,093 --> 00:50:40,799
Yeah...

567
00:50:41,899 --> 00:50:43,064
I can see that.

568
00:50:43,319 --> 00:50:44,550
What happened?

569
00:50:46,409 --> 00:50:49,897
Tom I don't want you going out
without your Surrie ever again.

570
00:50:49,996 --> 00:50:53,366
- Tom?
- You look very nice, Sexy.

571
00:50:53,487 --> 00:50:55,877
Ok... Don't start.
I'm sorry, those guys...

572
00:50:56,083 --> 00:50:59,295
They're friends of Brigettes, she
brought them over, she wanted to go to this party...

573
00:50:59,502 --> 00:51:00,680
I didn't even want to go.

574
00:51:00,801 --> 00:51:02,476
How long have you been jacking?

575
00:51:02,596 --> 00:51:03,811
I don't.

576
00:51:05,459 --> 00:51:06,784
I don't do it Tom.

577
00:51:06,905 --> 00:51:09,023
And what does it matter if I did?
Why are you being like this?

578
00:51:09,821 --> 00:51:11,213
Okay go have a good time.

579
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:49,568
Tom stop it!

580
00:52:11,492 --> 00:52:12,479
Tom?

581
00:52:13,484 --> 00:52:14,848
Tom, what was that?

582
00:52:16,722 --> 00:52:18,687
- What?
- What you want from me?

583
00:52:25,936 --> 00:52:27,102
I want you...

584
00:52:28,555 --> 00:52:29,881
...My wife.

585
00:52:31,507 --> 00:52:33,005
I am your wife.

586
00:52:33,181 --> 00:52:34,572
And you won't see it.

587
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:36,208
No. God.

588
00:52:37,506 --> 00:52:38,380
No you're not.

589
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:44,209
Not...
Not... this.

590
00:52:44,876 --> 00:52:47,422
Not this... thing...
This...

591
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,056
I just want you.

592
00:52:54,933 --> 00:52:57,190
And I want the woman that's in that room.

593
00:52:57,415 --> 00:52:58,562
My wife.

594
00:53:02,833 --> 00:53:04,556
Things have changed Tom.

595
00:53:04,676 --> 00:53:06,820
You're... No you've changed.
You're just scared.

596
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:09,039
You're just scared...
We could go talk to somebody...

597
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:13,132
Maggie...
Maggie your my wife.

598
00:54:13,905 --> 00:54:16,604
Agent Greer?
Is that... Is that you?

599
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:17,817
Yeah.

600
00:54:18,654 --> 00:54:22,057
- You look... You look terrible.
- Thanks you too.

601
00:55:06,316 --> 00:55:09,383
The chips completely fried.
What do you got on the girl?

602
00:55:09,768 --> 00:55:11,780
Come on...
Let's go talk to her Op.

603
00:55:13,288 --> 00:55:15,365
We can we access any Surrie in the grid.

604
00:55:16,126 --> 00:55:18,947
Touch of a Button, I can
tap into anyones feed.

605
00:55:36,643 --> 00:55:39,162
Transfer to remote operator.

606
00:55:58,282 --> 00:55:59,326
I wish I could help.

607
00:55:59,739 --> 00:56:01,197
This thing killed 5 cops.

608
00:56:01,611 --> 00:56:04,215
One of my men.
Almost put me in the ground.

609
00:56:04,772 --> 00:56:07,878
I know it's a weapon.
I want to know what kind.

610
00:56:07,932 --> 00:56:11,156
- You're asking me to compromise highly
classified information...
- I know where it is.

611
00:56:11,956 --> 00:56:12,896
Where is it?

612
00:56:13,977 --> 00:56:14,692
Right...

613
00:56:22,644 --> 00:56:24,055
Is called an O.D.

614
00:56:24,807 --> 00:56:26,377
Overload Device.

615
00:56:28,007 --> 00:56:30,856
The idea was to end
the battle with one shot.

616
00:56:32,107 --> 00:56:34,531
Giving the software virus straight to the CPU.

617
00:56:34,899 --> 00:56:36,920
Disables the Surries instantly.

618
00:56:37,478 --> 00:56:40,646
We didn't know the virus would
defeat the built in failsafes.

619
00:56:42,038 --> 00:56:43,316
...kill the operators.

620
00:56:43,637 --> 00:56:44,925
Who makes it?

621
00:56:46,843 --> 00:56:47,943
VSI.

622
00:56:50,038 --> 00:56:51,176
After the test

623
00:56:52,896 --> 00:56:54,428
the project was scrapped.

624
00:56:55,453 --> 00:56:56,958
Every unit was destroyed.

625
00:56:57,440 --> 00:56:58,879
Except this one right?

626
00:57:01,747 --> 00:57:02,724
Where is it?

627
00:57:03,674 --> 00:57:05,658
Right now it's in the hands of the Human Coalition.

628
00:57:05,778 --> 00:57:07,463
- How long have they had it?
- A day...

629
00:57:07,583 --> 00:57:08,884
Maybe two.

630
00:57:10,501 --> 00:57:11,996
This is out of your hands.

631
00:57:12,531 --> 00:57:14,224
Military will handle this.

632
00:57:21,941 --> 00:57:24,066
- You called for us?
- Take this to

633
00:57:24,338 --> 00:57:26,313
the federal building downtown.

634
00:57:27,366 --> 00:57:28,824
A woman will meet you there.

635
00:57:29,437 --> 00:57:31,459
Agent Jennifer Peters.

636
00:57:32,023 --> 00:57:34,994
You're to give it to her... and her alone.

637
00:57:43,174 --> 00:57:44,048
Peters.

638
00:57:45,102 --> 00:57:46,184
What are you doing?

639
00:57:46,878 --> 00:57:48,872
Just a background check on VSI.

640
00:57:49,492 --> 00:57:50,725
Structural stuff.

641
00:57:50,845 --> 00:57:52,966
Those are internal financial records.

642
00:57:53,474 --> 00:57:55,053
Talk to Jenkins in corporate.

643
00:57:55,852 --> 00:57:56,746
6th Floor.

644
00:58:01,957 --> 00:58:03,528
Don't forget the cheek bones.

645
00:58:05,634 --> 00:58:07,647
Okay, honey.
Face off.

646
00:58:19,999 --> 00:58:20,987
Maggs.

647
00:58:28,497 --> 00:58:29,568
Hiya Tom.

648
00:58:32,224 --> 00:58:34,998
Those ugh... Smile muscles need to set.

649
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:39,802
- Hey.
- Hi.

650
00:58:41,269 --> 00:58:42,728
I'm sorry about last night.

651
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:44,754
I'm at work Tom.

652
00:58:45,026 --> 00:58:47,132
- I didn't come here to argue.
- Good.

653
00:58:51,674 --> 00:58:53,903
See I feel like I've gone crazy.

654
00:58:57,775 --> 00:58:59,185
It's...
I just...

655
00:59:00,980 --> 00:59:02,353
I love you.

656
00:59:03,418 --> 00:59:06,212
I love this smart, beautiful

657
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:08,844
Intelligent, funny

658
00:59:10,151 --> 00:59:11,241
Woman... And...

659
00:59:13,516 --> 00:59:14,842
I can't sleep.

660
00:59:16,224 --> 00:59:18,885
And when I do... I have these dreams that are...

661
00:59:24,689 --> 00:59:26,739
And I can't stop
thinking about him.

662
00:59:27,834 --> 00:59:29,655
Tom... don't...

663
00:59:30,209 --> 00:59:31,817
Don't you ever think about him?

664
00:59:32,597 --> 00:59:34,347
Of course I think about him Tom.

665
00:59:34,547 --> 00:59:36,070
You say you don't sleep?

666
00:59:36,191 --> 00:59:37,612
You say you have nightmares?

667
00:59:37,732 --> 00:59:41,110
That girl who you say
is funny and charming and whitty...

668
00:59:41,523 --> 00:59:43,884
And has a great smile...
she doesn't smile anymore.

669
00:59:44,721 --> 00:59:45,839
I don't believe that.

670
00:59:46,093 --> 00:59:48,640
The only reason I can get up in the
morning and get out of the house

671
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,568
Is because THIS is who I am now.

672
00:59:50,794 --> 00:59:52,298
- That's okay, honey.
- No, no.

673
00:59:52,712 --> 00:59:54,348
- No.
- Maggie.
- NO!

674
00:59:54,858 --> 00:59:56,202
Maggie wait.

675
01:00:55,381 --> 01:00:58,550
Brothers and sisters gather
close and prepare yourselves.

676
01:00:59,311 --> 01:01:01,633
The day of the resurrection is upon us.

677
01:01:01,753 --> 01:01:05,602
The day we make history.
The day we launch the revolution!

678
01:01:12,649 --> 01:01:14,501
We all know what we're looking for.

679
01:01:14,621 --> 01:01:17,754
Remember...  Do not fire
unless absolutely necessary.

680
01:01:20,086 --> 01:01:21,722
Biologicals here.

681
01:01:29,064 --> 01:01:30,211
Over there!

682
01:01:38,839 --> 01:01:43,498
- Cease fire!
- Hands on your head.
- Cease fire.

683
01:01:53,773 --> 01:01:54,863
My God.

684
01:02:19,711 --> 01:02:22,720
I couldn't figure out why
the cops let Strickland off.

685
01:02:23,134 --> 01:02:25,080
So I started going
through the payroll records.

686
01:02:26,404 --> 01:02:27,749
You won't believe this.

687
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:30,307
- For the last 16 months...
- He was working for us.

688
01:02:30,748 --> 01:02:31,595
That's right.

689
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:34,368
Which means Stones
gotta be dirty.

690
01:02:34,953 --> 01:02:37,728
Looks like he hired Strickland to kill Canter.

691
01:02:44,368 --> 01:02:46,568
Hey Tom.
I thought you were on leave?

692
01:02:46,964 --> 01:02:48,026
Oh yeah... I am.

693
01:02:49,004 --> 01:02:51,167
Actually I was just suspended.

694
01:02:51,611 --> 01:02:54,122
Another investigation,
I'll just clear my desk out.

695
01:02:54,242 --> 01:02:55,701
You should be home.

696
01:02:55,821 --> 01:02:57,404
Recuperating Ok?

697
01:02:57,637 --> 01:02:59,518
Not walking around here in the flesh...

698
01:02:59,972 --> 01:03:02,671
I was at home then I came
here to clean out my desk.

699
01:03:02,790 --> 01:03:05,416
And you know... before the
medication kicks in... Hopefully...

700
01:03:05,635 --> 01:03:09,690
I can find a box...
And... Oh...

701
01:03:10,647 --> 01:03:13,223
Victor Welsh wanted me to say hello.

702
01:03:14,356 --> 01:03:15,193
I'm sorry?

703
01:03:15,313 --> 01:03:17,684
Victor Welsh, VSI, the good looking kid?

704
01:03:17,804 --> 01:03:21,050
Very excited you coming over there, finally
moving into the private sector

705
01:03:21,171 --> 01:03:22,347
You must be excited.

706
01:03:22,809 --> 01:03:25,197
Why don't you come into my
office, you're not looking too sharp.

707
01:03:26,118 --> 01:03:27,425
Yeah Yeah... I got a minute.

708
01:03:29,060 --> 01:03:31,769
It's a good move for you.
It's a really good group over there.

709
01:03:32,371 --> 01:03:33,273
Smart.
Talented.

710
01:03:33,978 --> 01:03:35,511
Great legal department.

711
01:03:36,500 --> 01:03:38,194
Great working environment.

712
01:03:39,463 --> 01:03:42,849
You gotta be happy with those
first year stock options huh?

713
01:03:43,074 --> 01:03:44,793
What are you talkin' about?

714
01:03:45,774 --> 01:03:48,472
Myles Strickland, the guy I was chasing...

715
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:51,179
The guy you hired to kill Canter.

716
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:54,114
- Tom you got it all wrong.
- You gave him the weapon.

717
01:03:54,442 --> 01:03:55,767
VSI makes them.

718
01:03:55,989 --> 01:03:59,440
They give one to you, you give it to
Strickland so he can go out and kill Canter.

719
01:03:59,560 --> 01:04:01,828
The only problem is, he
killed his son by mistake.

720
01:04:02,110 --> 01:04:05,006
- Something is wrong with you.
- Why are you doing this?

721
01:04:06,097 --> 01:04:08,015
Money? Is that what it is?

722
01:04:08,692 --> 01:04:10,395
You need help.

723
01:05:06,329 --> 01:05:09,544
This is Stone.  That son of a
bitch Greer disabled my unit!

724
01:05:09,665 --> 01:05:10,513
Stop him!

725
01:05:14,105 --> 01:05:15,251
Go... Go!

726
01:05:27,294 --> 01:05:30,181
Jesus.  No wonder VSI
wants Canter dead.

727
01:05:30,613 --> 01:05:32,164
He's in bed with The Prophet.

728
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:34,684
He's funding the
Anti-Surrogacy Movement.

729
01:05:35,081 --> 01:05:36,341
He's given them names.

730
01:05:36,698 --> 01:05:40,262
Crazy bastard invents surragotes and
does everything he can to destroy them.

731
01:05:40,949 --> 01:05:44,334
It doesn't connect Stone to the murder.
We need to link him to the weapon.

732
01:05:44,726 --> 01:05:46,297
He needed codes to use it.

733
01:05:46,634 --> 01:05:48,591
I want you to look for access codes.

734
01:05:49,869 --> 01:05:52,568
You get the codes... You nail Stone.

735
01:06:02,213 --> 01:06:04,441
Good job Agent Greer.
Thank you.

736
01:06:04,779 --> 01:06:07,309
This is Agent Peters.  I found Greer.

737
01:06:07,429 --> 01:06:09,867
He's been in an accident at
Market and Hanover.

738
01:08:09,399 --> 01:08:11,873
- FBI!!!
- Get out of the car!

739
01:08:13,179 --> 01:08:14,223
He's gone.

740
01:08:14,343 --> 01:08:15,727
Scanning for identity chip.

741
01:08:15,847 --> 01:08:17,589
He doesn't have one, he's a meatbag!

742
01:08:17,710 --> 01:08:19,276
There's and exit in the back!

743
01:08:48,865 --> 01:08:50,633
Hey! Where you going?!
HEY!!!

744
01:08:54,740 --> 01:08:57,203
Bobby it's Greer.
I need a remote shutdown.

745
01:08:57,324 --> 01:08:59,403
Agent Peters has been hijacked.

746
01:08:59,523 --> 01:09:01,378
You gotta disconnect her.

747
01:09:02,094 --> 01:09:03,955
Bobby?
Hello Bobby?

748
01:09:04,188 --> 01:09:05,505
Peters.

749
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:07,734
Have you gone insane?

750
01:09:07,978 --> 01:09:11,109
Why don't you put the gun down? huh?
What are you trying to prove?

751
01:09:11,845 --> 01:09:14,497
She's grabbing into the entire 3rd network!

752
01:09:26,476 --> 01:09:28,995
Maggie get offline right away, as
soon as you get this message.

753
01:09:29,353 --> 01:09:31,459
Something is going to
happen to the surrogates.

754
01:09:32,707 --> 01:09:36,063
- She'll only speak to you sir.
- Why don't you just move in and take her down huh?

755
01:09:36,740 --> 01:09:38,000
She has a human hostage.

756
01:09:39,646 --> 01:09:41,141
Uh... the slob Saunders...

757
01:09:52,465 --> 01:09:53,320
Peters?

758
01:10:00,346 --> 01:10:02,366
Peters it's me Andy Stone.

759
01:10:03,114 --> 01:10:04,674
That's far enough Stone.

760
01:10:08,135 --> 01:10:10,109
I know who hired you to kill me.

761
01:10:11,747 --> 01:10:15,122
I hope my old partners
at VSI paid you well.

762
01:10:16,496 --> 01:10:21,093
Did you feel even a second of remorse
when you found out you murdered an innocent boy?

763
01:10:22,227 --> 01:10:23,147
Canter?

764
01:10:24,755 --> 01:10:25,997
I don't believe it.

765
01:10:26,956 --> 01:10:30,945
Ok... How about you tell me something Doctor. Huh?

766
01:10:31,566 --> 01:10:33,673
What did you expect VSI to do?

767
01:10:33,973 --> 01:10:36,983
Just stand by while you tore
down everything they built?

768
01:10:37,292 --> 01:10:39,455
You left us no choice
but to take you out.

769
01:10:40,266 --> 01:10:43,660
You created the technology, you changed
the world and now want to destroy it?

770
01:10:44,591 --> 01:10:45,362
So what?

771
01:10:46,452 --> 01:10:47,816
So you can take us backwards?

772
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:50,731
So we can all live like Dreads?

773
01:10:54,466 --> 01:10:56,459
So we can live like
human beings.

774
01:10:58,819 --> 01:10:59,928
Really Doctor?

775
01:11:01,188 --> 01:11:03,182
You should learn
how to live with your regrets.

776
01:11:05,196 --> 01:11:06,522
Now give me the gun.

777
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,485
That's for my son.

778
01:11:48,905 --> 01:11:50,466
I need to see your boss.

779
01:11:50,586 --> 01:11:52,327
I need to see Dr. Canter right away!

780
01:11:52,448 --> 01:11:54,970
Oh good... Listen to me... I
gotta to see your boss.  Dr. Canter he...

781
01:12:07,398 --> 01:12:08,978
Device connected.

782
01:12:14,008 --> 01:12:15,907
Over here officers, this way.

783
01:12:36,404 --> 01:12:39,008
Warning!  Commencing Upload.

784
01:14:20,284 --> 01:14:21,450
Hello Tom.

785
01:14:25,264 --> 01:14:27,042
Nice to finally meet you.

786
01:14:27,802 --> 01:14:28,904
In the flesh.

787
01:14:36,015 --> 01:14:39,061
Now... Lie on the floor, face down.

788
01:14:41,577 --> 01:14:44,529
It's a little different when you have
to kill somebody with your own hands.

789
01:14:45,705 --> 01:14:48,704
You're going to have to squeeze the trigger.
You don't have a machine to do your dirty work.

790
01:14:50,726 --> 01:14:51,872
Feel that?

791
01:14:53,035 --> 01:14:55,527
An accelerated pulse, the
heightened awareness...

792
01:14:55,996 --> 01:14:58,262
Savouring each breath
as if it were your last.

793
01:14:58,798 --> 01:15:00,048
That what you've been missing.

794
01:15:00,792 --> 01:15:02,239
That's what everbodys been missing.

795
01:15:02,588 --> 01:15:07,008
- So you kill millions of people?
- I changed the course of human
history when I invented surrogates.

796
01:15:08,455 --> 01:15:10,186
Now I'm going to change it back.

797
01:15:10,674 --> 01:15:12,480
You can't change what's been done.

798
01:15:14,047 --> 01:15:15,881
You and I know that
better than most people.

799
01:15:17,048 --> 01:15:19,887
My son's death will not
have been in vain.

800
01:15:21,007 --> 01:15:23,009
Not if it heals mankind.

801
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:25,146
Heals mankind?

802
01:15:26,378 --> 01:15:28,625
That what you want to do?
You want to kill everyone?

803
01:15:29,010 --> 01:15:31,765
- And that's going to heal mankind?
- They're already dead.

804
01:15:31,886 --> 01:15:34,162
They died the minute they
plugged into those machines.

805
01:15:34,282 --> 01:15:35,520
This is not the solution.

806
01:15:35,640 --> 01:15:37,657
- That's the way it is.
- That's not the way it is!

807
01:15:37,757 --> 01:15:40,860
I had a vision.  I was going
to empower the powerless.

808
01:15:41,415 --> 01:15:44,133
To enable other like me to walk, to feel.

809
01:15:44,812 --> 01:15:48,913
- To live a normal life.
- Listen to me! They're going to call you
a murderer!  That is what you're doing!

810
01:15:49,032 --> 01:15:50,821
Surrogacy is a perversion.

811
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,354
It's an addiction.

812
01:15:52,474 --> 01:15:55,569
And you have to kill the
addict to kill the addiction.

813

Upload Complete.

814
01:15:58,651 --> 01:16:01,352
You're too late.
What I've done can't be stopped.

815
01:16:01,708 --> 01:16:03,438
Now you're going to be witness

816
01:16:04,548 --> 01:16:06,353
to the rebirth of humanity.

817
01:16:07,554 --> 01:16:09,246
That's my gift to you.

818
01:16:10,431 --> 01:16:11,831
No! NO!

819
01:16:36,772 --> 01:16:38,755
Selecting All Surrogates.

820
01:16:39,591 --> 01:16:41,133
How do we make it stop?

821
01:16:43,701 --> 01:16:45,995
Bobby it's Greer.
Tom Greer.

822
01:16:46,415 --> 01:16:48,427
How do we shut
this thing down?

823
01:16:50,278 --> 01:16:52,113
All Database Selected.

824
01:16:53,385 --> 01:16:55,799
Jesus... He's trying to kill everyone.

825
01:16:56,482 --> 01:17:01,728
Listen... That thing has just uploaded a virus into the system
that's going to kill anyone who's using a surrogate.

826
01:17:02,292 --> 01:17:03,496
It's already started.

827
01:17:03,702 --> 01:17:06,947
Bobby we need to
unplug everyone... Now!

828
01:17:07,819 --> 01:17:08,816
Think!

829
01:17:09,234 --> 01:17:11,946
Uh.... Uh....

830
01:17:14,445 --> 01:17:17,006
I... Ok... Move over to
the terminal on the left!

831
01:17:17,326 --> 01:17:19,433
Type in password:
RED253

832
01:17:19,922 --> 01:17:23,147
We can't unplug them
but maybe we can buffer the operators.

833
01:17:24,415 --> 01:17:26,475
Oh God... Ok... we've got 10 seconds!

834
01:17:30,300 --> 01:17:31,702
Ok look... there are three passes.

835
01:17:32,086 --> 01:17:33,751
Type in Tango in the first.

836
01:17:33,799 --> 01:17:35,196
Xray in the second.

837
01:17:35,211 --> 01:17:37,023
772 in the third.

838
01:17:37,079 --> 01:17:38,178
Hit Enter.

839
01:17:41,412 --> 01:17:44,018
HIT ENTER!!! What
happe... Ah.. Shit!

840
01:17:44,152 --> 01:17:46,644
SHIFT and Enter!
SHIFT and Enter!

841
01:17:49,148 --> 01:17:51,338
Uh... Ah...

842
01:17:54,472 --> 01:17:57,127
Uh... You just saved about
billion lives there.

843
01:17:59,576 --> 01:18:02,176
Ok... Now we gotta keep
the surrogates from getting fried.

844
01:18:02,296 --> 01:18:04,423
Please go back to the first
terminal hit the Enter key.

845
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:06,896
Hit the Enter key please!

846
01:18:08,062 --> 01:18:10,300
Good... Now press Yes.

847
01:18:15,939 --> 01:18:17,097
So that's it?

848
01:18:17,425 --> 01:18:18,825
Everyone's safe?

849
01:18:18,945 --> 01:18:20,283
- What?
- All the people?

850
01:18:20,403 --> 01:18:23,179
Yes... Yes... Of course yes.
All the operators are safe.

851
01:18:23,300 --> 01:18:26,565
But if you don't press abort, all the
surrogates are going to be destroyed.

852
01:18:29,837 --> 01:18:32,244
We don't have a lot
of time man... Hit Yes.

853
01:18:33,257 --> 01:18:35,433
Hi? Hello?  Hit Yes Greer!

854
01:18:37,088 --> 01:18:38,790
Greer I'm talking
about ALL the surrogates!

855
01:18:49,934 --> 01:18:51,241
Wha... What are you doing?

856
01:18:53,413 --> 01:18:54,325
Greer??!!

857
01:18:54,662 --> 01:18:56,744
For God's sakes what
are you waiting for?!

858
01:18:56,849 --> 01:18:58,413
Press the friggin' button damnit!

859
01:18:58,832 --> 01:18:59,979
Freeze!!!

860
01:19:33,752 --> 01:19:35,463
Transmit Complete. 

861
01:21:47,836 --> 01:21:48,824
Excuse me.

862
01:23:20,028 --> 01:23:24,287
Bare with us as we're still trying to piece
together exactly what has occured today 

863
01:23:24,541 --> 01:23:28,264
 There has been a total systems
failure of the central surrogate grid

864
01:23:28,531 --> 01:23:33,251
In every major city on the eastern
seaboard, possibly in the entire United States...

865
01:23:33,516 --> 01:23:37,360
 ...describing an identical failure
in those cities this is unbelievable...

866
01:23:37,480 --> 01:23:39,110
...no reports of human casualties

867
01:23:39,476 --> 01:23:42,503
the damage appears limited only
to surrogate units...

868
01:23:42,624 --> 01:23:46,453
...thus far, no statements from VSI.  They have
not responded to requests for information...

869
01:23:46,573 --> 01:23:49,800
 ...Paris, London, Beijing
all reporting the same thing...

870
01:23:49,920 --> 01:23:54,803
...there is still no official word when or
if surrogate services can be restored.

871
01:23:55,236 --> 01:23:59,062
It appears, at least for now,
that we are on our own.
