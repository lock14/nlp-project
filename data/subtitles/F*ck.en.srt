1
00:01:05,141 --> 00:01:09,145
Him and I were the last two left
out of the original...

2
00:01:09,229 --> 00:01:11,773
And when you were shelled,
how did you feel?

3
00:01:12,315 --> 00:01:14,150
I don't know. I just...

4
00:01:14,317 --> 00:01:18,238
After Norman got hurt... Killed, why...

5
00:01:18,530 --> 00:01:20,406
I was all right when we were moving up,

6
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:22,075
or attacked, or anything like that,

7
00:01:22,158 --> 00:01:23,201
but when we'd get pinned down,

8
00:01:23,284 --> 00:01:25,870
I'd start thinking about him
laying back there.

9
00:01:25,954 --> 00:01:29,499
I believe that your profession
is calling it nostalgia.

10
00:01:30,208 --> 00:01:32,669
- In other words, homesickness.
- Yes, sir.

11
00:01:32,919 --> 00:01:36,839
It was induced when,
shortly before the war,

12
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:40,093
I received a picture of my sweetheart.

13
00:01:40,343 --> 00:01:41,552
Yes?

14
00:01:52,063 --> 00:01:53,689
I'm sorry. I can't continue.

15
00:01:53,773 --> 00:01:55,316
That's all right.

16
00:01:56,109 --> 00:01:59,362
Well, when I was in combat, Mindanao...

17
00:01:59,445 --> 00:02:00,488
Can you speak louder?

18
00:02:00,571 --> 00:02:02,865
- I have trouble hearing you.
- Yes, sir.

19
00:02:03,699 --> 00:02:05,368
During that time...

20
00:02:06,202 --> 00:02:09,372
I got word that my brother,

21
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:13,125
he was killed at Guadalcanal.

22
00:02:13,834 --> 00:02:14,961
What is your name?

23
00:02:15,044 --> 00:02:17,129
Ivan Bibic, sir.

24
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,548
You feeling okay, Ivan?

25
00:02:19,632 --> 00:02:20,716
Yeah.

26
00:02:22,385 --> 00:02:25,012
What are you thinking about right now?

27
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,723
Home, sir.

28
00:02:27,807 --> 00:02:29,642
Going home.

29
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:29,511
So, how many medals did they give you?

30
00:04:29,594 --> 00:04:30,970
Just one.

31
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:36,017
I thought your chest
would be all covered with them.

32
00:04:39,562 --> 00:04:41,981
Did you kill all the Japs, or leave some?

33
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:44,567
- We got most of them.
- Good.

34
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:52,075
Of course...

35
00:04:53,368 --> 00:04:56,788
If I'd been there,
it wouldn't have taken so long.

36
00:05:12,053 --> 00:05:14,722
I heard they had you in one of their camps.

37
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:19,101
Why didn't you get away?

38
00:05:27,276 --> 00:05:29,278
Was it rough?

39
00:05:33,365 --> 00:05:35,951
Well, thank God you survived.

40
00:05:37,244 --> 00:05:40,372
You were gone so long
I was afraid you were dead.

41
00:05:40,831 --> 00:05:43,584
I thought I'd have to make
some new babies.

42
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:49,673
I saved your old Harley for you.

43
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,342
- No.
- Yeah.

44
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:55,262
It's under a tarp in the back of the barn.

45
00:06:42,684 --> 00:06:44,019
Maria?

46
00:06:46,688 --> 00:06:48,023
Maria?

47
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:55,840
But you don't understand the movie, Al.

48
00:07:56,132 --> 00:07:59,719
She died because she needed his love.
Do you know what I mean?

49
00:07:59,802 --> 00:08:02,305
Al, please don't. Don't go too far.

50
00:08:02,388 --> 00:08:04,307
Baby, just let me put my hand there.

51
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,808
Al.

52
00:08:06,392 --> 00:08:09,854
- Come on, why not?
- Please. Yes. No!

53
00:08:09,937 --> 00:08:11,689
Baby, I know what you want.

54
00:08:11,898 --> 00:08:13,357
Al, just listen.

55
00:08:13,566 --> 00:08:15,234
Could you love me like that?

56
00:08:15,318 --> 00:08:16,903
Like what?

57
00:08:17,361 --> 00:08:19,238
Like the movie.

58
00:08:19,906 --> 00:08:21,741
Through life and all the way into death.

59
00:08:21,824 --> 00:08:23,951
Of course. Of course, baby.

60
00:08:24,243 --> 00:08:26,621
Why do y, um...

52
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:58,642
- Helen, you don't have to worry.
- I don't?

53
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:02,162
I haven't forgotten
our daughter's birthday.

54
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,886
- No...
- I'm taking her to the theatre.

55
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,403
- You could come if you like.
- Oh, that sounds really nice.

56
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,730
But she asked me to ask you
if you wouldn't mind

57
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:19,051
if she went to London
with some friends to see a band.

58
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,929
Right.

59
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:26,441
I'm sure she'll ask you herself.

60
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,887
So there's going to be an adult
with them, yeah?

61
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,927
Oh, Robert, you know, she's...
16 years old.

62
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:39,441
I'll think about it.

63
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,486
I...I have to go.

64
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:51,211
Are you looking after yourself?

65
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,529
You look tired.

66
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:00,845
- It's a busy time of year.
- Yeah, of course. Of course.

67
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,761
Don't be too hard on Katie.

68
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,129
Please?

69
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,047
So I'll see you tonight.

70
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:44,129
Fucking hell...

71
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,406
Good luck.

72
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:48,490
Do we have any books
about plumbing in the library?

73
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,807
Possibly.

74
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,649
Good.

75
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:55,371
Good.

76
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,529
(Groans)

77
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,525
- (Knock)
- Come in.

78
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,648
Robert, please, take a seat.

79
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,962
So how are things?

80
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,969
Good. Fine.

81
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,721
That's great.
And how's it going with the Year 12s?

82
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:33,604
Fine.

83
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:38,885
I still seem to be missing
some assessment grades for them.

84
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,163
Yes. Sorry, I haven't sent those over.
I'll do that.

85
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:45,090
I know this time of year is a pain,

86
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,601
but I really am going to need them.

87
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,121
Yeah, of course. I'm really sorry.

88
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:55,485
Let's see. I think I've almost done
everything. Won't take me five minutes.

89
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,046
Thanks, Robert.

90
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,561
Just one other thing before you go.

91
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:07,085
Some of the teachers
have raised concerns

92
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,124
about the noise level
from your class.

93
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,009
Well, em...

94
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,363
All right. I'll get them to keep it down.

95
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,883
Yes. It's probably nothing.
You know how some people can get.

96
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,210
But it was more about the actual
language being used by the students.

97
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,405
Robert?

98
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:35,049
- I'll keep an eye on it.
- Thanks. I appreciate that.

99
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,765
Just one other thing.
It's probably nothing.

100
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,488
Crossed wires or something,
but there's been a complaint about, em...

101
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,008
...about you bringing in alcohol
to the premises.

102
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,921
- I cannot think what that's about.
- I know, I know.

103
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,646
It's probably, as I said,
just crossed wires.

104
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,084
I know you'd never do such a thing
because it would mean suspension.

105
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,850
Exactly.

106
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,564
Thanks, Robert.

107
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:17,008
I think I might pop into your class
tomorrow. OK?

108
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,965
Nothing to be concerned about.
I'll just sit at the back and observe.

109
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,084
- Of course.
- Thanks, Robert

110
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,642
And Robert...

111
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:32,765
Please, never send a memo like that
across the staff network again

112
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,928
without consulting me first.

113
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:44,247
He stinks of booze.

114
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:48,365
(Sarah) I am trying to get rid of him,
but the unions won't let me.

115
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:53,449
(Lift pings)

116
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,242
Hold the door!

117
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,442
You look shit.

118
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,961
Nice memo, by the way.

119
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,129
But...

120
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,643
...how we perceive ourselves...

121
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,851
...may not be
how we are perceived by others.

122
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,850
Lear believes himself to be

123
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,930
a good and responsible monarch.

124
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:40,841
However, Goneril, Regan and the Fool
constantly remind him

125
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,123
that he is a man who has...

126
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,846
...lost...

127
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:50,169
...his kingdom,

128
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:53,762
his faithful daughter and his wits

129
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,281
through his own...

130
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,842
(Pen squeaks)

131
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,002
..folly.

132
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,441
This is shown...

133
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:08,642
(Pupils laugh)

134
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:50,810
You will report for an hour's detention
each night for a week.

135
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,843
Starting tonight.

136
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:54,962
(Bell rings)

137
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,081
Kate...

138
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:31,402
An right?

139
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,240
- Anything going on?
- Not really.

140
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,648
What's this?

141
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:44,970
It's a memo from Anderson.
Sent out to all members of staff.

142
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:49,847
"Did you know there were nearly
7,000 recorded violent incidents

143
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:54,966
"affecting teachers, janitors,
dinner ladies and cleaners last year?"

144
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:59,290
Is he for real? Does he want gun
detectors and searching kids' bags?

145
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,971
- I dunno.
- Guy's a nut bag.

146
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:05,687
I'm going for a smoke.
I'll start locking up the gates.

147
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,768
Yeah, all right.

148
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,642
Let's have a look.

149
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,683
Oi! What do you think you're doing?

150
00:17:10,840 --> 00:17:13,047
- Night, Miss.
- Night.

151
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,968
(Mobile phone beeps)

152
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:50,408
Kate...

153
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:55,481
Put the phone away.

154
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:28,728
- I'll give this to your mother tonight.
- That's so unfair.

155
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:34,165
Kate, unfair is when something
happens for no reason.

156
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,727
This is bullshit.

157
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,009
You're bullshit.

158
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,330
A pathetic man who puts his daughter
in detention just to spend time with her.

159
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:51,171
Please, Kate, that's enough.

160
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,682
So afraid he drinks a bottle of whisky
before stepping in a classroom.

161
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:59,328
- Please, just sit down...
- No! Our lives are better without you.

162
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:04,926
Mum said she'd rather be alone forever
than get back with you.

163
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,206
Ohh...

164
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,044
Oh...

165
00:19:56,600 --> 00:19:58,329
Hello!

166
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,647
Hello! Let me out!

167
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,330
Ah...

168
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,046
Jeez. Aaargh!

169
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:08,569
Ah, fuck.

170
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:12,040
What the fuck...? What the fuck?

171
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,202
What are you doing?

172
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,526
Fuck...

173
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,529
Get out!

174
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:21,446
Aargh.

175
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,320
Hey! Let me out of here!

176
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,920
You're in so much fucking trouble!

177
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:39,930
Hey...

178
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,329
No! Hey!

179
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,647
Hey! Let me out!

180
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,444
Help!

181
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,688
Help me!

182
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,770
Get me out of here! Let me out!

183
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,285
No!

184
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,482
Please! God!

185
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,249
No!

186
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:50,282
Hey, Jake, it's me.

187
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,888
No, I'm using the phone in Reception.
Can you come and pick me up?

188
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,840
Just come and pick me up.

189
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:03,769
Jake?

190
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,609
Jake!

191
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,889
(Sighs)

192
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:20,120
The, um, the phone's not working.

193
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,042
(Clears throat)

194
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,330
Yeah, the...the line's down.

195
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,329
That's it?

196
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:56,240
I'm sure the phone company
will fix it soon.

197
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,169
OK.

198
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,041
Come on, damn you - bruise.

199
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,091
- What is it?
- There's someone out there.

200
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:33,328
- I don't see anyone.
- No, there was someone watching me.

201
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,641
I swear I saw someone!

202
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,843
You're...
You're Mr Anderson's girl, ain't you?

203
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,128
For fuck's sake.

204
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,929
Jesus Chri...!

205
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,928
(Door slams)

206
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:21,410
Mr Anderson. How can I help you?

207
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,366
- I think there are kids in the building.
- It Is a school.

208
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:28,927
One of them threw something
against the window.

209
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,849
- Threw what?
- A milkshake.

210
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:34,726
- A milkshake?
- Are you a parrot? Yes, a milkshake!

211
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,809
What flavour?

212
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,000
I'm glad that you End this amusing.

213
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,091
(Sighs) What do you want me
to do about it, Mr Anderson?

214
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,922
I'd like you to do your job instead
of looking at pictures of naked men.

215
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,840
- It's a fitness magazine.
- Fantastic.

216
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:02,969
- Whereabouts?
- E Block corridor.

217
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:08,840
- You and your daughter are just as bad.
- You've seen my daughter?

218
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:11,361
- She was here 10 minutes ago.
- Why?

219
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,687
To use the phone
but the lines are down.

220
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,770
- Since when?
- Half an hour ago?

221
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:20,566
- And this doesn't worry you?
- No, Mr Anderson, it doesn't.

222
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,808
So where was she going?

223
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:26,049
Back into the school.
Maybe she threw the milkshake.

224
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:30,767
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling the police!

225
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:33,281
Calm down, Mr Anderson.

226
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,643
I'll sort this out.
You go and find your daughter.

227
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:40,890
The police will hardly come out
over a spilt milkshake.

228
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,041
Fucking Jesus Christ!

229
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:14,441
(Music from radio)

230
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:31,042
(Switches music off)

231
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,442
Who's there?

232
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,846
I tell you, if I catch you little brats,
you're going to have hell to pay!

233
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:19,849
Kate?

234
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,371
Ah! Oh, sh...

235
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:38,882
- I'm sorry.
- After your plumbing books?

236
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:46,127
Have you seen my daughter?

237
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:49,881
Kate? The last time I saw her
in the library was about a year ago!

238
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,807
Is something up?

239
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:57,527
We just had a bit of an argument.
And then she stormed off.

240
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:01,326
- In the toilets having a cigarette?
- She doesn't smoke.

241
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,844
Of course she doesn't. It'll be fine. Wait
here, keep me company while I finish up.

242
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:10,965
I know teenage girls.
Give her a chance to calm down.

243
00:29:11,080 --> 00:29:15,688
No, I think I'd better find her.
You see, I think there are...

244
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:18,690
...kids inside the building.

245
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,963
The phones, they've all stopped working.

246
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:25,801
- You should leave.
- OK. Where are you going?

247
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:30,369
I need to find my daughter.
And you should leave now!

248
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,169
Right.

249
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:40,529
Robert?

250
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,849
Shit!

251
00:29:56,040 --> 00:29:58,646
Unbelievable! You think that's funny?

252
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:12,129
Some of you children
don't deserve to be in school.

253
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:29,241
We'll see how funny you think this is when
you have to explain it to your parents.

254
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,929
(Faint rustle)

255
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,047
You are in so much trouble.

256
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:05,042
(Door opens)

257
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,767
Kate, it's me.

258
00:31:48,840 --> 00:31:51,810
- Fuck! You scared the shit out of me.
- I was outside.

259
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:56,881
Yeah, some creepy guy was watching me.
But I wasn't expecting you for ages.

260
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:11,245
- (Knocking)
- Kate, are you in there? Kate?

261
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,681
I can smell smoke.

262
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:20,765
Kate, if you are in there,
please, honey, we have to leave now.

263
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,440
We won't say anything more
about what happened earlier.

264
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:30,530
I know you were upset
and I was very...

265
00:32:33,280 --> 00:32:37,683
I was very tough on you.
But, please, Kate...

266
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:40,007
We have to go now.

267
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,806
- Right. I'm coming in.
- (Sarah) Robert?

268
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,561
What on earth are you doing?

269
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:54,604
I have to find my daughter.

270
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,042
I'm sure if she's in the toilet,
you should let her finish.

271
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,850
But we have to leave now.
I think we might be under attack.

272
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:08,088
Why would you think that?

273
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,248
- The phone lines were cut.
- Cut?

274
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,601
Yes! They're not working!

275
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,122
Maybe the line is down.
They're probably fixing it.

276
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,121
Right. I was walking down the corridor.
Someone threw something at the glass.

277
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,006
I think it was a milkshake.
Then they wrote in it, "U R dead"!

278
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,487
(Sniggers)

279
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:36,921
Jake Peoples. I might have known.
He's your culprit, Mr Anderson. Come on.

280
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:41,443
Right, Kate, you go home with your father.
We'll deal with you on Monday.

281
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,564
- My father hit me.
- Sorry?

282
00:33:47,040 --> 00:33:49,042
My father hit me.

283
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,483
Is this true?

284
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,208
- This has got nothing to do with school.
- Right. Go home how.

285
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:02,527
I'll deal with you later. Now!

286
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,245
- Come with me. We'll phone your mother.
- That's not necessary...

287
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,567
- Go home, Robert.
- Please.

288
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,365
This is very serious. I said go home.

289
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,801
- Kate...
- Listen!

290
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:21,808
Don't make me call Security.
Have some dignity.

291
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,407
(Console beeps)

292
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,242
(Thud)

293
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,249
Hello?

294
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,449
Hello?

295
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,169
Ah!

296
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,726
James, you scared me.

297
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,047
Sorry, Miss Wright.

298
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,889
I, uh...

299
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,207
I just saw the light on.

300
00:36:03,840 --> 00:36:08,164
Yeah, Mr Anderson was worried
about some kids running around the...

301
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,202
Asked me to check it out.

302
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,971
Right.

303
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:23,521
Well, there's no one in here now.

304
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,802
(He whispers) Bitch.

305
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:05,367
(Taps keys on mobile phone)

306
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,530
Hello?

307
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,242
Is there someone there?

308
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:21,882
Look, if this is some kind of joke,
I don't think it's...

309
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,722
Please don't hurt me.

310
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,323
Please.

311
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:59,283
Don't...

312
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,884
Please!

313
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,848
Oh, God!

314
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:12,762
You do realise these are
very serious allegations you're making?

315
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:21,525
I need you to write down
exactly what happened.

316
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:27,002
I'm going to call your mother, so go into
the staff room and use the desk there.

317
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,484
I can see you're doing fuck all, Dad.

318
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,562
Goodbye, Anderson.

319
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,762
Oh, for Christ's sake!

320
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,967
(Clears throat)

321
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,487
Hi, James? It's Sarah.

322
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:55,602
My phone's not working.

323
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,650
OK, thanks, James.
Oh, just one other thing.

324
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:05,367
It's a bit of a sensitive issue,
but there's been an incident

325
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:09,849
between Mr Anderson and his daughter
and I've asked him to leave the premises.

326
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:12,486
Could you make sure
he won't come back in?

327
00:42:12,600 --> 00:42:15,570
I think his state of mind is fragile
at the moment.

328
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:46,442
(Ringing tone)

329
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:47,561
Oh...

330
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,842
- (Phone rings)
- Hello?

331
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,088
- 'Mrs Anderson?'
- Yes?

332
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,124
It's Sarah Balham here
from Wittering College.

333
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:58,528
- There's been a bit of an incident here.
- Is Kate OK?

334
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,291
No, your daughters fine.
She's next door.

335
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:11,525
However, she has made a serious
complaint about your husband,

336
00:43:11,640 --> 00:43:14,530
and I think it's best
if you come and collect her.

337
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,803
- What are you talking about?
- 'She claims he hit her.'

338
00:43:17,920 --> 00:43:20,127
What? Is she all right?

339
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,928
No, she's fine, a bit shaken. But I think
it is best that you come and collect her.

340
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:28,044
Yeah, yeah.
Yes, of course, of course. I'll...

341
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:30,162
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

342
00:43:30,280 --> 00:43:32,567
We shall meet you down at reception.

343
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:34,921
- 'Fine.'
- Thank you.

344
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,641
(Vacuum cleaner whines)

345
00:44:21,440 --> 00:44:23,442
(Glass smashes)

346
00:44:23,560 --> 00:44:25,562
(Smashes again)

347
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,162
(Clatter)

348
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:20,527
(Vacuum cleaner still on)

349
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,729
Aaaagh!

350
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,811
No, no, get, get out of...

351
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:21,400
Get out of here! Get out of here.

352
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,605
Get out of here! I've called the police.
Look, I've called the police.

353
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:28,724
Please get out of here. Leave me alone.

354
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,683
Please... No!

355
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,727
(Mobile phone ring tone)

356
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:48,891
- Kate?
- No, it's Robert.

357
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,401
Listen, Helen, something's wrong.

358
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,251
What the hell is going on, Robert?

359
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:58,524
Sarah Balham just called
and told me that you hit Kate.

360
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,642
Is that true?

361
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:04,567
'Please tell me that's not true.'

362
00:47:04,680 --> 00:47:06,364
Oh, Helen...

363
00:47:06,480 --> 00:47:08,801
Helen, it wasn't like that.

364
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:13,842
What was it like, Robert?

365
00:47:16,440 --> 00:47:19,887
I'm sorry, Helen.
I can't talk to you about it now.

366
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,403
'No, listen, don't you dare!
I need to know what happened.'

367
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:27,524
- Call the police.
- 'Robert?'

368
00:47:27,640 --> 00:47:29,005
Robert?

369
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,010
Sarah?

370
00:47:57,080 --> 00:47:59,242
(Retches)

371
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,806
(Rap music plays)

372
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:23,161
Jake?

373
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:26,601
Jake!

374
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,330
(Turns music up)

375
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,564
Kate?

376
00:48:57,120 --> 00:48:58,770
Kate?

377
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:03,605
Kate!

378
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:08,442
(Dials phone)

379
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:11,726
(Woman) 'Which emergency service
do you require?'

380
00:49:11,840 --> 00:49:15,083
- Police.
- 'Please state your location'

381
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:17,202
Wittering College.

382
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:21,644
A member of staff has been killed
and I think my daughter is in danger.

383
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,286
'Please bear with me one second, sir.'

384
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:29,807
- (Man's voice) 'Mr Anderson'?'
- It is... How did you know my name?

385
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,922
'We spoke last week. Five times.

386
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:35,442
- 'This line is for emergencies only.'
- I'm aware of that.

387
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:39,087
'Any queries regarding children
loitering in cars outside...'

388
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:41,441
This is an emergency.

389
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,291
And my daughter is
in this building somewhere.

390
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,687
You've got to send somebody now!

391
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,848
(Jake) Kate!

392
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:09,129
Kate!

393
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:30,961
(Mobile phone ring tone)

394
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:01,722
Who the fuck are you?

395
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:04,529
What do you want?

396
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,682
(Door creaks)

397
00:51:53,840 --> 00:51:56,525
Got ya! it's you that's been
messing around here?

398
00:51:56,640 --> 00:52:00,850
There's someone out there. They have
knives. They were chasing me.

399
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:05,970
You almost got me. I bet you pull
that stunt with your father all the time.

400
00:52:06,080 --> 00:52:08,208
I'm telling you the truth.

401
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,682
Have you been drinking?
Are you on drugs?

402
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:14,723
You need to call the police!

403
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,763
You kids will say anything.

404
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:18,291
(Clatter)

405
00:52:22,800 --> 00:52:24,768
A friend of yours?

406
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:30,002
You better stay put.

407
00:52:30,840 --> 00:52:34,447
Don't go out there.
I'm telling you, they have knives!

408
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:49,280
I've had it with you fucking kids!

409
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,210
(Sobbing)

410
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,243
Help me.

411
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:07,042
Christ! Christ! Christ!

412
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:21,881
You little shit.

413
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:25,402
You little shit.

414
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,002
You little shit.

415
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,041
Ughl

416
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:36,401
(Distant screams)

417
00:54:38,040 --> 00:54:40,361
Agh! Aaaagh!

418
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:42,721
Aargh! Aargh! Aargh!

419
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:15,602
(Faint clicking sound)

420
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:26,364
Agh!

421
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:12,802
All right, Brian?
I've just had Mrs Balham on the phone.

422
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:15,605
She says Anderson has hit
his own daughter.

423
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:18,371
She wants me
to take him off the... Whoa!

424
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:22,610
- I need to find my daughter.
- Right, that's it, you crazy old man!

425
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:25,200
- Brian, Brian!
- They've killed Sarah.

426
00:57:25,320 --> 00:57:28,688
Of course(!) Explain that
to the police when they get here.

427
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:31,087
Look at the screen.

428
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:35,685
Please, just look at the damn screen!

429
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:41,290
I've already called the police.
They're on their way. Where is this?

430
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:43,687
That's F Block. It's the art studio.

431
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:44,801
Wait!

432
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:49,362
Sarah told me to call the police
when I saw you.

433
00:57:49,480 --> 00:57:51,801
Sarah is dead.

434
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,202
I just spoke to her on the phone.

435
00:57:55,320 --> 00:57:57,687
Then speak to her again.

436
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:09,682
(Ringing tone)

437
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:13,769
Mrs Balham...

438
00:58:13,880 --> 00:58:18,249
'I'm sorry. The number you have
dialed is not in service at this time.'

439
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,250
Now, would you help me
find my daughter?

440
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:26,725
Brian?

441
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,047
Brian, are you reading me, mate?

442
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,722
(Footsteps running)

443
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,004
Kate...

444
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:14,561
Brian, answer the fucking radio.

445
00:59:14,680 --> 00:59:15,681
Over.

446
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,002
(Footsteps running)

447
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,642
(He fetches)

448
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:16,804
No! No!

449
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:21,244
No... We've got to get out of here!
We've got to get out of here!

450
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:26,241
Listen to me!
Help me find my daughter!

451
01:00:39,960 --> 01:00:44,921
I always told her to memorise where
the cameras were, so she could be seen.

452
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:48,007
Just in case.

453
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:52,486
Kate!

454
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:55,604
Fuck's sake, man, they'll hear you!

455
01:00:56,800 --> 01:00:58,290
Kate!

456
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:09,371
Who are you?

457
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:18,771
Please, just leave us alone, yeah?

458
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,202
James, open the door.

459
01:01:45,320 --> 01:01:47,288
Open the damn door!

460
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:54,286
James... James, please,
just open the door.

461
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,084
Yeah?

462
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:03,522
Damn you!

463
01:02:06,840 --> 01:02:09,081
(Police siren wailing)

464
01:03:03,320 --> 01:03:06,767
Go round the side of the building
and check everything's OK.

465
01:03:06,880 --> 01:03:10,248
I'll see if I can locate
that waste of space security guard.

466
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,163
Hey, you!

467
01:05:24,280 --> 01:05:26,681
I've got to get out of here.

468
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,802
What's going on?

469
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:31,491
- You've got to help me get out of here!
- Calm down!

470
01:05:31,600 --> 01:05:34,683
- Let me go! You've got to let me go!
- What's wrong with you?

471
01:05:34,800 --> 01:05:39,283
- You've got to help me get out of here.
- What's going on? I'm warning you!

472
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:39,401
(Sound of knives sharpening)

473
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:04,529
Yeah?

474
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:07,610
You fucking want some?

475
01:07:15,120 --> 01:07:17,521
(Sharpening sounds intensify)

476
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,040
Kate?

477
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:49,171
Dad?

478
01:07:57,520 --> 01:07:59,363
I knew you would come.

479
01:07:59,480 --> 01:08:02,324
Oh, my baby!

480
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:05,091
It's all right.

481
01:08:08,000 --> 01:08:09,923
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

482
01:08:13,440 --> 01:08:15,442
I'm so sorry.

483
01:08:15,560 --> 01:08:17,608
I'm sorry, my darling.

484
01:08:17,720 --> 01:08:19,722
I'm so sorry.

485
01:08:22,120 --> 01:08:23,645
Oh...

486
01:08:23,760 --> 01:08:26,240
Oh, I'm sorry.

487
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:30,281
Dad!

488
01:08:47,760 --> 01:08:49,762
Kate...

489
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:50,961
Kate!

490
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:55,522
It's all right, my darling.

491
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:58,120
Shh. It's all right, it's all right.

492
01:08:59,360 --> 01:09:01,362
It's all right, sweetheart.

493
01:09:01,480 --> 01:09:04,609
Come on. Come on.
Come on, my darling.

494
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:13,721
(She breathes heavily)

495
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:54,684
It's all right, darling. It's all right.

496
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,451
Don't worry. You just stay calm.

497
01:09:58,800 --> 01:10:00,962
We'll be in a hospital soon.

498
01:10:01,080 --> 01:10:05,961
Yes, darling, it's all right. Don't worry,
I've got you now. I've got you.

499
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,605
Hold on to the car. Lean on the car,
my darling. It's all right.

500
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,725
The car... There's a car there!

501
01:10:15,840 --> 01:10:19,003
- It's all right. Come on.
- Dad, it's Mum's car. Dad!

502
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,964
- Come on now...
- Dad, it's Mum's car!

503
01:10:23,520 --> 01:10:25,648
- Oh, God.
- Oh, please go back.

504
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:28,445
- Oh, no.
- Dad, you have to go back.

505
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:31,962
If I don't get you to hospital,
you'll die.

506
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:35,004
Please, Dad, it's Mum's car though.

507
01:10:35,120 --> 01:10:37,122
No, please!

508
01:10:37,240 --> 01:10:39,049
- No!
- Come on.

509
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:40,605
No!

510
01:10:41,480 --> 01:10:43,403
No, Dad!

511
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:55,610
If you do this, I'll hate you for ever.

512
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:02,922
(Switches on ignition)

513
01:11:31,160 --> 01:11:32,685
Hello?

514
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,767
Is there somebody there?
