00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:03,700
MEZHRABPOMRUS 1927

2
00:00:05,647 --> 00:00:09,940
THE GIRL WITH THE HAT BOX

3
00:00:23,136 --> 00:00:27,686
Natasha Korostelyova and her grandfather
lived in a small house in Moscow's suburb.

4
00:01:33,975 --> 00:01:37,493
Natasha and her grandfather
made hats at home.

5
00:02:14,019 --> 00:02:17,314
I'm afraid, Natashenka,
that you'll soon fly away from me!

6
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:27,369
You mean marriage?
Don't be afraid!...

7
00:02:58,923 --> 00:03:02,755
Every morning Natasha brought
the ordered hats to Moscow...

8
00:06:26,686 --> 00:06:29,130
From his remote village
Ilya Snegiryov was coming

9
00:06:29,228 --> 00:06:31,340
to Moscow dreaming to enter
the worker's faculty.

10
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:16,340
MADAME IRENE, HATS, was the shop
for which Natasha worked.

11
00:09:33,967 --> 00:09:37,332
Marfushka, the shop owner's servant.

12
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,842
Madam, the house committee is here!

13
00:11:54,802 --> 00:12:00,000
One of the apartment's rooms of Mrs Irene
was registered under Natasha's name but

14
00:12:00,062 --> 00:12:04,000
it was in fact occupied by Nikolay
Matveevich Trager, Irene's husband.

15
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:13,409
And where's Natalya Korostelyova,
the tenant registered here?

16
00:14:02,631 --> 00:14:05,741
Darling, you should spend
the night here sometimes!

17
00:14:05,944 --> 00:14:09,189
The house committee
is bothering us again!

18
00:14:58,277 --> 00:15:04,012
I'd like to know your turnover.
I'm the tax assessor.

19
00:15:53,247 --> 00:15:55,932
Idiot! It's the tax assessor!

20
00:16:06,981 --> 00:16:08,939
In search of housing.

21
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:19,187
Excuse me, is there a room
for rent anywhere?

22
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:02,017
Ilya Snegiryov spent all nights
at the railway stations.

23
00:18:50,556 --> 00:18:54,735
For heaven's sake,
what do you want from me?

24
00:18:55,908 --> 00:18:57,765
Excuse me, I...

25
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:14,459
Incidentally...  dropped a rouble...
searched... I have nowhere to sleep...

26
00:19:58,062 --> 00:20:00,268
What were you dreaming of, Natasha?

27
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,154
Poor boy,
he has no place to sleep.

28
00:21:35,264 --> 00:21:37,900
In search of another meeting.

29
00:23:35,346 --> 00:23:38,630
Madame Irene's home
was preparing to receive guests.

30
00:24:29,583 --> 00:24:31,082
I can get you a room if you want.

31
00:24:57,872 --> 00:25:00,902
Ilya Snegiryov. small farmer.
Single...

32
00:25:04,074 --> 00:25:06,372
...Married.

33
00:25:11,087 --> 00:25:13,936
Natalya Korostelyova. Milliner.
Single...

34
00:25:18,237 --> 00:25:20,728
...Married.

35
00:26:58,011 --> 00:27:03,726
You asked, I got it fixed : here is
my husband!  He's gonna live in my room.

36
00:27:14,147 --> 00:27:19,139
I'll let nobody in! Though you're registered
in this room, it is not yours!

37
00:27:47,576 --> 00:27:50,918
You'd better not offend my wife!
Is it her room or not?

38
00:28:00,586 --> 00:28:02,340
Where is it?

39
00:28:20,971 --> 00:28:25,099
Well, here's our tenant...
and she's just got married!...

40
00:28:32,189 --> 00:28:34,516
May I ask you to go
into the next room!

41
00:30:04,734 --> 00:30:05,739
It's falling.

42
00:30:40,113 --> 00:30:43,753
Good-bye "husband"!
I'll visit you some day...

44
00:31:05,980 -->  00:31:08,290
The first night went perfectly.

45
00:33:34,260 -->  00:33:36,840
Mr and Mrs Trager declare war.

43
00:33:36,922 --> 00:33:41,646
I declare that tenant Natasha Korostelyova,
de facto, doesn't intend to inhabit her room.

44
00:33:41,851 --> 00:33:45,937
On the basis of all above mentioned
it is obvious that Ilya Snegiryov,

45
00:33:46,172 --> 00:33:51,000
inhabiting the room, turns out to be
her so-called husband and, thereby,

46
00:33:51,213 --> 00:33:56,338
is entitled to be evicted from the apartment
that I'm responsible for.    N. Trager

47
00:34:45,247 --> 00:34:46,631
Nothing, but lottery bond...

48
00:35:03,877 --> 00:35:07,965
Irene darling! give me some money... 
I'm broke! heads and tails...

49
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:01,516
You're still indebted to me
for my work.

50
00:36:27,082 --> 00:36:28,391
Pay this trollop!

51
00:37:02,966 --> 00:37:04,990
STATE LOTTERY LOAN

52
00:37:57,021 --> 00:37:58,729
Stop singing!

53
00:38:21,259 --> 00:38:25,014
Madame, the house committee 
has come to see the new tenant!

54
00:38:49,154 --> 00:38:54,526
And where is your, so to speak, wife?

55
00:39:06,641 --> 00:39:08,347
I'm here!

56
00:40:17,685 --> 00:40:22,017
Lend me 30 kopecks for the return ticket
till tomorrow...

57
00:40:43,069 --> 00:40:48,248
Fogelev still hoped that
Natasha would come with the last train.

58
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:32,000
I'm late for the last train!

59
00:42:04,393 --> 00:42:07,469
...The last train swept
his last hope away...

60
00:43:40,156 --> 00:43:41,702
Aren't you sleeping?

61
00:43:42,364 --> 00:43:43,298
Yes, I am!

62
00:44:23,996 --> 00:44:25,742
I'm afraid! A mouse is running!

63
00:45:29,308 --> 00:45:30,887
My God! A rat!

64
00:45:38,766 --> 00:45:39,844
In the morning...

65
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:57,439
Let's listen now to the first winning numbers
of the state lottery loan...

66
00:47:07,764 --> 00:47:11,727
10.000 roubles prize goes to
the bond 7219, serial number 05...

67
00:47:21,086 --> 00:47:23,328
25.000 roubles prize...

68
00:47:24,886 --> 00:47:27,280
goes to the bond n° 1419963,
serial number 03...

69
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:06,287
Natasha's address! Quick!

70
00:48:11,533 --> 00:48:14,021
She won 25.000 roubles 
with my lottery bond!

71
00:48:41,072 --> 00:48:43,017
Natasha's address!!

72
00:49:51,509 --> 00:49:53,095
Working with a round jack.

73
00:50:59,834 --> 00:51:00,888
Going to the station for a newspaper...

74
00:52:17,587 --> 00:52:18,560
I love you!

75
00:52:23,691 --> 00:52:26,327
Natashka, marry me!

76
00:52:41,092 --> 00:52:42,699
Give me back the bond!

77
00:52:44,766 --> 00:52:47,158
It is a dear souvenir to me...

78
00:52:58,616 --> 00:53:00,941
I left it in Ilya's room.

79
00:54:09,779 --> 00:54:11,437
Here's your bond!

80
00:54:14,093 --> 00:54:16,459
You won 25.000 roubles!

81
00:54:47,292 --> 00:54:49,061
Farewell...

82
00:55:31,020 --> 00:55:33,448
I wanted to say...
I agree, I'll...

83
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:38,867
... be your wife!

84
00:55:47,619 --> 00:55:50,263
Now I don't agree!...
Farewell!

85
00:56:41,017 --> 00:56:45,954
I request to dissolve my marriage
with citizen N. P. Korostelyova,

86
00:56:46,057 --> 00:56:51,088
she won 25.000 roubles
and people could consider

87
00:56:51,154 --> 00:56:54,901
that I'd married her for money.
                           Ilya Snegiryov

88
00:56:55,608 --> 00:56:57,947
I agree - - - -

89
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:37,327
Your wife wanted money instead of bond... 
It's for me the uttermost pleasure!

90
00:57:38,435 --> 00:57:40,180
The lottery bond is in her hands!

91
00:58:18,815 --> 00:58:19,791
Give me back the bond!

92
00:58:46,104 --> 00:58:52,092
Before it's too late, Fogelev decided
to make an offer to Natasha.

93
01:01:06,695 --> 01:01:09,146
Sign the divorce petition...

94
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:52,081
I DO NOT agree - - -

95
01:01:52,193 --> 01:01:54,246
Why are you making fun of me?

96
01:01:54,328 --> 01:01:56,483
- - - N. Korostelyova

97
01:03:53,030 --> 01:03:55,572
Here's your bond!

98
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:47,227
Idiot! Go and buy one hundred bonds!

99
01:05:29,338 --> 01:05:31,765
THE END
