1
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,650
Better hurry.

2
00:01:26,099 --> 00:01:27,549
Here you go, my friend.

3
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,150
Make sure you get us as close as you can!

4
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,599
I'll give you something extra,
if you make it a good trip.

5
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:36,049
Hey, I'm going to get you close, my friend.

6
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:38,599
But not too close, eh?
You don't want to be eaten.

7
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,500
You ready, amigo?

8
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:43,750
- Ready!
- Ready!

9
00:01:47,650 --> 00:01:50,700
One, two, three!

10
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:01,299
Eric, heave!

11
00:02:14,849 --> 00:02:16,150
You scared?

12
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,050
Uh-uh. This is great.

13
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,699
See anything yet?

14
00:02:32,849 --> 00:02:34,750
No, not yet.

15
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:06,599
- What was that?
- I don't know.

16
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,500
- Hold on!
- What's happening?

17
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,800
Just hold on!

18
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,849
Make it stop!

19
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,349
What happened to them?

20
00:03:23,449 --> 00:03:25,000
I don't know.

21
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:27,550
Oh, my God!

22
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,900
- We're gonna crash!
- All right, all right. No, we're not.

23
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,500
- I'm gonna cut us loose.
- We're gonna crash!

24
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,449
I'm gonna take this loose!

25
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:36,000
- Let go of the rope. Let go of the rope!
- We're gonna crash!

26
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,650
Move your hands!

27
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:40,949
Come on!

28
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:45,250
Here we go!

29
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,300
It's gonna be okay, bud.

30
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,399
Actually, Charlie, those are herbivores.

31
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,550
They really wouldn't be interested
in fighting with each other.

32
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:24,899
But these ones here are carnivores,
and they really like fighting with each other.

33
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,949
They use their teeth and their claws
to rip each other's throats out.

34
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,699
Alan, he's 3. Let's wait till he's 5.

35
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,550
Oh! Right. Sorry, Charlie.

36
00:04:35,649 --> 00:04:37,250
- Ellie?
- Yeah?

37
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:40,199
It's Tom again. He says he has to
talk to you about the last chapter.

38
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:42,449
Just tell him I'm not gonna lose
the Jack Horner quote.

39
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,800
My editor thinks he's a paleontologist.

40
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,949
Hey, Mark!

41
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:49,550
Hey, babe, look who's here!

42
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,699
This is Alan.

43
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,550
Nice to meet you, Alan.

44
00:04:55,649 --> 00:04:56,800
- I heard a lot about you.
- Daddy, daddy...

45
00:04:56,899 --> 00:04:59,300
This is a herbivore
and that's the dinosaur man.

46
00:04:59,399 --> 00:05:01,199
Dinosaur man?

47
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:04,850
Jack, say my name. Is my name Alan?

48
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,199
Is my name Alan?

49
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,949
He used to know me.

50
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,550
- It's sad, huh?
- Here you go.

51
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,199
Thanks. So, you know, Mark's been
working for the State Department now.

52
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,550
Yeah, what do you do, Mark?

53
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:26,000
It's international relations,
mostly treaty law, things like that.

54
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:27,550
Uh-oh!

55
00:05:27,649 --> 00:05:29,550
- Call of the wild one.
- Oh, here. I'll go.

56
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:33,250
You guys... catch up.

57
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,899
Thanks, babe.

58
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:38,750
He's a great guy.

59
00:05:40,149 --> 00:05:41,600
So, what are you working on now?

60
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,199
Raptors, mostly.

61
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,500
My favorite.

62
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,850
Do you remember the sounds they made?

63
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,500
I try not to.

64
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,399
Ellie, all our theories
about raptor intelligence,

65
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,300
what they were capable of,
we weren't even close.

66
00:05:56,399 --> 00:05:57,399
Tell me.

67
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,350
Well, we did cranial scans of a fossil skull

68
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:02,699
and we found what looks like a very
sophisticated resonating chamber.

69
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,850
Wait a second. So, we were right.

70
00:06:04,949 --> 00:06:06,449
I mean, they had the ability to vocalize.

71
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,500
I'm convinced it's the key
to their social intelligence.

72
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,750
Which explains why they could
work together as a team.

73
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,350
They'd coordinate attacks, so their prey
wouldn't know what was going on.

74
00:06:14,449 --> 00:06:15,850
They could talk to each other.

75
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:18,100
To a degree we never imagined.

76
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,699
Ellie, they were smart.

77
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,649
They were smarter than dolphins or whales.

78
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,699
They were smarter than primates.

79
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,199
I just wanted to say,
if you ever need help with anything,

80
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:37,000
sometimes you forget to ask.

81
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,100
So, you can call me. Anything, anytime.

82
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,250
Sure.

83
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,350
You're still the best.

84
00:06:50,149 --> 00:06:51,600
I mean that.

85
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,850
The last of my breed.

86
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
It is through the painstaking study
of the anterior chamber

87
00:07:06,199 --> 00:07:09,750
in multiple specimens that we can
determine the exciting correlation

88
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:12,250
between the upper palate and the larynx.

89
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:15,449
This lets us theorize, theorize, mind you,

90
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:19,699
that the raptor was capable of
sophisticated vocalizations,

91
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,949
which would have been
a tremendous evolutionary advantage.

92
00:07:23,050 --> 00:07:27,550
Raptors were fierce, intelligent
and socially sophisticated.

93
00:07:27,649 --> 00:07:31,350
They were able to hunt in numbers
and coordinate their efforts.

94
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:35,550
Were it not for the cataclysmic
events, which overtook them,

95
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:38,899
it is entirely possible that raptors,
rather than humans,

96
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,800
would have become the dominant
species on this planet.

97
00:07:42,899 --> 00:07:45,100
I hope this has been of interest.

98
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,399
It certainly excites us as paleontologists.

99
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,449
There is much, much more to discover.

100
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:56,500
That is why we continue to need,
and ask for your support.

101
00:08:00,699 --> 00:08:02,050
Thank you.

102
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:14,100
Thank you very much, Dr. Grant.

103
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,750
Now, does anyone have a question?

104
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,649
Fine.

105
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:24,149
Does anyone have a question that
does not relate to Jurassic Park?

106
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:29,100
Or the incident in San Diego,

107
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:32,000
which I did not witness?

108
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,600
Yes, sir?

109
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:38,700
Your theory on raptors is good and all,

110
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:41,049
but isn't all this conjecture kind of moot?

111
00:08:41,149 --> 00:08:45,500
I mean, once the U.N. and Costa Rica and every-
one decides how to handle that second island,

112
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,399
scientists will just go in
and look for themselves.

113
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:52,049
Dinosaurs lived 65 million years ago.

114
00:08:52,149 --> 00:08:56,299
What is left of them is fossilized in the rocks.

115
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,850
And it is in the rock that
real scientists make real discoveries.

116
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:04,450
Now, what John Hammond
and InGen did at Jurassic Park

117
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:08,350
is create genetically engineered
theme-park monsters.

118
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:11,049
Nothing more and nothing less.

119
00:09:11,149 --> 00:09:14,350
Are you saying that you wouldn't
want to get onto Isla Sorna

120
00:09:14,450 --> 00:09:17,000
and study them, if you had the chance?

121
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:21,600
No force on Earth or Heaven
could get me on that island.

122
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:35,750
So, what've we got here, Nashy?

123
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:38,700
Einhorn 20-millimeter,
gas-operated semi-automatic.

124
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,750
10-shot, magazine fed, rotating bolt,
recoil-reducing muzzle brake.

125
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,500
High explosive incendiary...

126
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,350
Udesky.

127
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,549
<i>Mr. Udesky, it's Paul Kirby. Just checking...</i>

128
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:58,700
Ah, yes, sir! We're good to go here.

129
00:09:59,450 --> 00:10:01,000
Matter of fact, I can lock things down

130
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,299
just as soon as you drop me that payment.

131
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:11,200
Well, that's right, two of the very
best men I could possibly find.

132
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,450
No, sir, I haven't worked
with them personally,

133
00:10:15,549 --> 00:10:19,700
but believe me, sir, both of these men
come very highly recommended.

134
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:29,149
<i>Are you all right?</i>

135
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:30,899
Nothing to worry about, sir.

136
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:33,549
It's gonna be a walk in the park.

137
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:45,399
Billy, I don't think I'm doing this right.

138
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,950
Let's try the toothbrush.

139
00:10:58,250 --> 00:10:59,950
You've got to go slowly.

140
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,649
Just take a little bit at a time.

141
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,750
I can never tell what's rock and what's bone.

142
00:11:07,149 --> 00:11:08,799
Technically, it's all rock.

143
00:11:08,899 --> 00:11:12,200
The calcium in the bones
is replaced during fossilization.

144
00:11:12,700 --> 00:11:15,100
But you can feel the difference, see?

145
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,250
Rough.

146
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,450
Smooth.

147
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:22,100
Rough, smooth.

148
00:11:29,350 --> 00:11:30,649
Dr. Grant.

149
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:32,799
Mr. Brennan.

150
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:35,200
So, how did it go?

151
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:39,250
Well, it's not too late
to change your major, Billy.

152
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,600
- That good, huh?
- Worse.

153
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:44,750
- We're gonna have to pack up in four weeks.
- Three.

154
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,950
I had to rent some equipment.

155
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,200
Come here. I got to show you something.

156
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:50,799
You like computers, right?

157
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:52,450
I like the abacus, Billy.

158
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:55,250
Meet the future of paleontology.

159
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:57,649
It's a rapid prototyper.

160
00:11:58,299 --> 00:12:00,750
I enter in the scanned data
from the raptor skull.

161
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,500
The computer breaks it down
into thousands of slices.

162
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,500
And this thing sculpts it,
one layer at a time.

163
00:12:08,799 --> 00:12:10,000
It's done.

164
00:12:19,799 --> 00:12:23,000
I give you the resonating chamber
of a Velociraptor.

165
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,200
Listen to this.

166
00:12:36,649 --> 00:12:38,049
Wow!

167
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:41,000
This is brilliant, Billy. Really, it is.

168
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:43,700
Sad to say, it's just a little bit late.

169
00:12:43,799 --> 00:12:47,700
Dr. Grant? Paul Kirby, Kirby Enterprises.

170
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,799
My card. How're you doing, Billy?

171
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,850
What can I do for you, Mr. Kirby?

172
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,299
Well...

173
00:12:56,549 --> 00:12:59,049
First thing, I'm a great admirer of yours.

174
00:12:59,149 --> 00:13:02,200
And I have a proposition
I'd like to discuss with you.

175
00:13:02,299 --> 00:13:04,750
Would you have dinner
with my wife and me this evening?

176
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,100
It'll be our treat.

177
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,600
That'd be great,

178
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:10,850
but I'm tired. I've been traveling.
Maybe some other time.

179
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,399
Believe me, this will be worth your while.

180
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,549
We'd love to.

181
00:13:14,649 --> 00:13:17,049
Oh, terrific! That's the spirit. Good.

182
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:18,700
This evening then.

183
00:13:28,149 --> 00:13:29,399
- Ah, Billy, thank you for coming.
- How are you?

184
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,649
- Dr. Grant, how are you?
- Mr. Kirby.

185
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:34,950
- Amanda, this is Billy and Dr. Grant.
- Mrs. Kirby, how are you?

186
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:36,549
So, what are you boys drinking?

187
00:13:38,149 --> 00:13:40,549
- Ice Pick, Catfish.
- Two, please, Cat.

188
00:13:40,649 --> 00:13:42,899
Well, we've admired your work for years.

189
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,700
Really. Truly inspiring.

190
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:47,100
Amanda and I just love the outdoors.

191
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,399
Heck, we've been on just about every
adventure tour they can come up with.

192
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,649
The Nile, Galapagos, K2.

193
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,500
We even have two seats reserved on
the first commercial flight to the moon.

194
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:59,899
And for our wedding anniversary this year,

195
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,950
we wanted to do something really special.

196
00:14:02,049 --> 00:14:03,899
- Something...
- Once in a lifetime.

197
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,049
So, I've chartered an airplane
to fly us over Isla Sorna.

198
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:10,450
And we'd like you to be our guide.

199
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:14,149
There you go, guys.

200
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:19,700
That's a very kind offer, Mr. Kirby,
but I'm a very, very busy man.

201
00:14:19,799 --> 00:14:23,049
I can recommend a couple of guys
who are really highly qualified...

202
00:14:23,149 --> 00:14:26,049
No, no, no. You're the best.

203
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:27,750
You've seen these animals in the flesh.

204
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,850
There's no one who even comes close to you.

205
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:34,250
You wouldn't be able to fly low enough
to see anything of any real interest.

206
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:36,549
Well, see, that's the interesting part,

207
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:39,049
because we have permission to fly low.

208
00:14:39,149 --> 00:14:40,299
How low?

209
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:44,750
Well, I'm no aviation expert, but a heck of
a lot lower than anybody else I can tell you.

210
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,350
From what I understand,

211
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:48,799
it's pretty much whatever we want.

212
00:14:49,649 --> 00:14:51,000
That's hard to believe.

213
00:14:51,149 --> 00:14:53,049
Well, you see, through my business dealings,

214
00:14:53,149 --> 00:14:55,000
import-export, emerging markets,

215
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,149
I've made a lot of friends in high places.

216
00:14:57,250 --> 00:15:00,000
In this case, the Costa Rican government.

217
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,799
Dr. Grant, you have no idea

218
00:15:02,899 --> 00:15:05,250
how important it is to us
that you come along.

219
00:15:05,350 --> 00:15:06,649
It would make all the difference.

220
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:07,750
Mrs. Kirby, I...

221
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:09,549
And, of course, we'd love to make

222
00:15:09,649 --> 00:15:11,649
a contribution to your research here.

223
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,700
So...

224
00:15:15,549 --> 00:15:19,000
I could write all kinds of numbers
on this check, Dr. Grant.

225
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,850
Tell me.

226
00:15:23,149 --> 00:15:25,250
What's it gonna take?

227
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,399
Even with what I pay you,
couldn't you afford a better bag?

228
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,700
No way.

229
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:45,700
This one's lucky.

230
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:48,000
Couple of years ago,

231
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,000
some buddies and I went hang gliding
off these cliffs in New Zealand.

232
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:55,899
And this big updraft came and
swept me right against the side.

233
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,000
Wham!

234
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,100
Wow, that does sound lucky.

235
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:02,350
It was this strap alone that saved my life.

236
00:16:02,899 --> 00:16:04,850
Got hooked on a rock as I was falling.

237
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:08,700
Reverse Darwinism.
Survival of the most idiotic.

238
00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:14,700
Alan, I want to thank you
for bringing me along.

239
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,899
Yeah, well, the bones will still
be there when we get back.

240
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,500
That's the great thing about bones.
They never run away.

241
00:16:20,649 --> 00:16:24,350
And truth is, you got me into this.

242
00:16:25,799 --> 00:16:29,399
And I have no intention of being
on my own with these people.

243
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:34,299
Don't get too excited, Billy.

244
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:36,250
Chances are, we won't see a thing.

245
00:16:37,549 --> 00:16:38,899
Your turn to be nice.

246
00:16:39,649 --> 00:16:41,000
Wake me when we get there.

247
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:50,500
So, how do you know the Kirbys?

248
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:53,600
Through our church.

249
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:14,799
Alan!

250
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,799
Alan!

251
00:17:18,049 --> 00:17:20,299
Wake up. We're almost there.

252
00:17:34,299 --> 00:17:38,349
<i>Unidentified aircraft approaching Isla
Sorna, this is San Juan Approach.</i>

253
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,650
<i>You're flying in restricted airspace.</i>

254
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:42,950
<i>Immediately turn to coordinates 2...</i>

255
00:18:33,299 --> 00:18:35,200
My God, I'd forgotten.

256
00:18:47,900 --> 00:18:50,150
We did it, honey. We're here.

257
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:53,799
Cooper, if you see anything, yell up!

258
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,599
No, I thought I'd keep it to myself.

259
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,750
I'm sorry. Look, everyone,
if you look out the left of the plane,

260
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,549
you can see a whole herd of Brachiosaurus.

261
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:05,150
In fact, you can see in the front of
the group the alpha male grazing there.

262
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,299
Udesky, Nash? How about up front?
You guys see anything?

263
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,799
Nothing yet, Mr. Kirby.

264
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,799
Mrs. Kirby, look, out here,
you'll see a group of Triceratops.

265
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:17,049
Mr. Kirby, we have a landing strip up ahead.
You want me to put her down?

266
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:20,299
No, no! I told you, I want to
circle first, see the whole island.

267
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,200
What do you mean set her down?
You can't land here!

268
00:19:22,299 --> 00:19:24,299
- What are you talking about?
- Hold on, hold on. I can explain...

269
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,400
You cannot land on this island!

270
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,750
- It's gonna be fine, Dr. Grant.
- Don't worry, please, Dr. Grant.

271
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,950
- Are you crazy?
- Sit down!

272
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,250
Dr. Grant, will you please sit down?

273
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,500
Billy, tell me we didn't land.

274
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,900
Eric!

275
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:53,200
Ben!

276
00:19:53,299 --> 00:19:55,599
I think they're looking for someone.

277
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,799
Ben!

278
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:01,700
Eric!

279
00:20:02,299 --> 00:20:03,500
Ben!

280
00:20:06,299 --> 00:20:08,599
Dr. Grant, are you all right?

281
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,700
- I'm sorry we had to...
- Who hit me?

282
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:11,799
- I'm sorry we had to be so rough.
- Who hit me?

283
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,150
That would be Cooper.

284
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,000
What are they doing?

285
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,349
They're setting up a perimeter
to make the place safe.

286
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,700
- These guys are good.
- Mr. Kirby, trust me.

287
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,549
On this island, there's no such thing as safe!

288
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,500
We have to get back on that plane!

289
00:20:23,650 --> 00:20:25,500
Will you tell your wife to stop
making that noise!

290
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:27,500
That is a very, very bad idea!

291
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:29,900
- Amanda!
- Ben!

292
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:33,450
Amanda, honey, Dr. Grant
said that's a bad idea.

293
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:34,950
What?

294
00:20:35,049 --> 00:20:37,750
He says it's a bad idea!

295
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,049
What's a bad idea?

296
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:43,700
What was that?

297
00:20:44,549 --> 00:20:46,150
That's a Tyrannosaurus.

298
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:47,400
I don't think so.

299
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,150
It sounds bigger.

300
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,650
We have to leave!
We have to leave now!

301
00:20:56,299 --> 00:20:58,150
- Get on the plane now!
- What's going on?

302
00:20:58,849 --> 00:21:00,700
- Get on the plane!
- Get on the plane!

303
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,500
What about the other guy?

304
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,900
Cooper's a professional.

305
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,650
He can handle himself.

306
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:11,150
Get on the plane! Hurry!

307
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,750
It's all right.

308
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,500
- Paul, we can't...
- It's all right. It's all right.

309
00:21:26,599 --> 00:21:27,799
We'll just circle the island.

310
00:21:28,099 --> 00:21:29,650
Give me a hand here, Udesky!

311
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,349
- Stop!
- What are you doing?

312
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:51,799
That's Cooper!

313
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,599
Stop.

314
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,799
Come on, get out of the way!

315
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:59,049
You know I can't stop this plane.

316
00:22:01,549 --> 00:22:03,000
Oh, my God!

317
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,900
- Fuel cut-off!
- We're going down!

318
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,250
You okay?

319
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:36,950
We're okay up here.

320
00:22:37,349 --> 00:22:39,400
Everyone, just stay put.

321
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:41,950
San Juan Approach. Mayday, mayday!

322
00:22:42,049 --> 00:22:43,799
Who has the satellite phone?

323
00:22:44,299 --> 00:22:46,650
I do. I got it right here.

324
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:49,400
I'm not getting anything. The radio's gone.

325
00:22:58,099 --> 00:22:59,650
We haven't landed yet.

326
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,500
- <i>All circuits are busy.</i>
- Damn it!

327
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,799
Oh, man!

328
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,250
What was that?

329
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,849
Keep still! Keep still!

330
00:23:13,950 --> 00:23:16,250
Relax. What is it? What?

331
00:23:18,299 --> 00:23:20,349
- What is it?
- Hold it! Hold it!

332
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,650
Hang on, everyone!

333
00:23:44,099 --> 00:23:45,549
Help me!

334
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:47,900
Mrs. Kirby, come back!

335
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:49,700
No!

336
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:51,450
Amanda!

337
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,200
Follow me! This way!

338
00:25:47,750 --> 00:25:49,049
In here!

339
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,500
I think we lost him.

340
00:26:30,549 --> 00:26:32,150
It's okay, it's dead.

341
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,000
Nobody move a muscle.

342
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:40,000
No, no, no, no! Please, please, don't!

343
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:41,849
Stop, please.

344
00:27:43,150 --> 00:27:45,799
It's time you did some explaining, Mr. Kirby.

345
00:27:46,549 --> 00:27:49,099
We called everyone.
We did everything we could.

346
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,299
No one would help us.

347
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:53,000
The Costa Rican government
said this is a no-fly zone.

348
00:27:53,099 --> 00:27:56,500
The U.S. Embassy,
that's our U.S. Embassy,

349
00:27:56,599 --> 00:27:58,799
told us we should accept the inevitable.

350
00:27:58,900 --> 00:27:59,900
Can you believe that?!

351
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,799
You let a 12-year-old go parasailing alone?

352
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:02,849
- No!
- No!

353
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:04,650
He wasn't alone. He was with a friend.

354
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:06,549
Ben Hildebrand.

355
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:09,000
Paul and I divorced over a year ago.

356
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:10,750
All right, so, why me?

357
00:28:11,049 --> 00:28:13,450
He said we needed someone
who'd been on the island before.

358
00:28:13,549 --> 00:28:16,750
Yes, but I did not tell you
to kidnap somebody.

359
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,900
I have never been on this island.

360
00:28:20,049 --> 00:28:22,250
Sure you have. You wrote that book.

361
00:28:22,349 --> 00:28:26,750
That was Isla Nublar.
This is Isla Sorna, Site B.

362
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:28,950
You mean there are two islands
with dinosaurs on them?

363
00:28:29,049 --> 00:28:30,349
- All right, you stay out of this.
- You know what? Please!

364
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,099
So, how long have they been missing?

365
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:33,349
8 weeks.

366
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:35,049
Almost 8 weeks now.

367
00:28:37,349 --> 00:28:40,650
Billy, we go back to the plane,
salvage what we can.

368
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,049
Then we make for the coast.

369
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:45,700
Dr. Grant, we're not leaving
this island without our son.

370
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,250
Then you can go and look for him.

371
00:28:48,349 --> 00:28:51,150
Or you can stick with us,
as long as you don't hold us up.

372
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,500
Either way,

373
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:56,000
you probably won't get off this island alive.

374
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,750
So, what do we do?

375
00:29:10,950 --> 00:29:12,900
We search for your son.

376
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,150
In the direction that they're going.

377
00:29:18,650 --> 00:29:19,900
Excellent, excellent.

378
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,799
Oh, sorry, sorry.

379
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:50,599
That is nothing you haven't seen before, Paul.

380
00:29:52,299 --> 00:29:54,799
How much weight did you say you lost?

381
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,849
About 25 pounds. I've been swimming.

382
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:01,849
Swimming? You hate to swim.
You don't even know how to swim.

383
00:30:01,950 --> 00:30:03,799
I know. I learned.

384
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,900
You look good.

385
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,099
So do you.

386
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,000
How would you classify it, Billy?

387
00:30:13,099 --> 00:30:14,400
Well...

388
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,150
It's a super-predator.

389
00:30:19,299 --> 00:30:21,000
A Suchomimus.

390
00:30:21,549 --> 00:30:23,900
- That snout.
- No, think bigger.

391
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:26,500
- Baryonyx?
- Not with that sail.

392
00:30:28,099 --> 00:30:30,200
<i>Spinosaurus aegypticus</i>.

393
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:35,500
I don't remember that on InGen's list.

394
00:30:35,599 --> 00:30:36,950
Because it wasn't on their list.

395
00:30:37,049 --> 00:30:39,700
And that makes you wonder
what else they were up to.

396
00:30:51,849 --> 00:30:53,599
So, Mr. Kirby, tell me.

397
00:30:53,700 --> 00:30:58,250
When you climbed K2, did you base
camp at 25,000 or 30,000 feet?

398
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:02,900
30,000 feet. We were pretty close to the top.

399
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,700
You were about 1,000 feet above it, actually.

400
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,099
No, no, that's a common mistake.

401
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,599
Now, Mr. Kirby, there's no such thing
as Kirby Enterprises, is there?

402
00:31:15,099 --> 00:31:16,849
It's Kirby Paint and Tile Plus.

403
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,099
The "Plus" stands for bathroom fixtures.

404
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,049
We're in the Westgate Shopping Center,
Enid, Oklahoma.

405
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:24,549
So, I don't suppose that check
you wrote us is any good.

406
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,849
Now, listen to me, I will pay you
the money I owe you.

407
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,549
- This is good.
- No matter what.

408
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:33,099
Here we are, in the worst place
in the world, and we're not being paid!

409
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,250
All right. Now, wait, fellas. Hold on!
I'll make this up to you.

410
00:31:37,349 --> 00:31:40,250
If you ever do a bathroom or a kitchen...

411
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,200
You're not really a mercenary, are you?

412
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:44,700
I never said I was.

413
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:47,000
That's true. What are you?

414
00:31:47,099 --> 00:31:49,599
Well, I'm like a booking agent.

415
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:52,200
One of the guys got sick and couldn't come.

416
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:54,400
Excuse me. Here.

417
00:31:55,349 --> 00:31:58,150
- So, you run a hardware store?
- Paint and tile, yeah.

418
00:31:58,849 --> 00:32:00,650
You never can tell about people, can you?

419
00:32:00,750 --> 00:32:02,299
Ain't that the truth?

420
00:32:03,150 --> 00:32:04,950
- Eric!
- Quiet.

421
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:06,349
Would you stop that?

422
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:08,799
Dr. Grant says this is
very dangerous territory.

423
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,900
Look, maybe we should
split up or something.

424
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:12,400
You know, we could cover twice
as much ground that way.

425
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:14,000
Dr. Grant says that's a bad idea.

426
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,599
Dr. Grant! Dr. Grant says...

427
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,400
Well, what's the good of hiring an expert,
if we're not gonna use his advice?

428
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:21,250
Yeah, except Dr. Grant isn't looking for Eric.

429
00:32:21,349 --> 00:32:22,599
He's looking for the coast.

430
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:23,950
Okay, fine. Go ahead and scream.

431
00:32:24,049 --> 00:32:27,150
And when that "Tricycloplots" attacks you,
don't come crying to me.

432
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:29,200
- Don't worry about that.
- What?

433
00:32:29,299 --> 00:32:30,450
- Nothing.
- What did you say?

434
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:32,099
- Never mind.
- What did you say?

435
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:33,599
God, Paul, just drop it!

436
00:32:33,700 --> 00:32:36,849
If we split up, I'm going with you guys.

437
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,950
- Eric!
- Eric!

438
00:32:50,450 --> 00:32:52,450
- Mrs. Kirby!
- Eric!

439
00:32:54,099 --> 00:32:57,750
Mrs. Kirby, the chances are remote
they're still in the vicinity.

440
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:05,599
Young adult.

441
00:33:07,799 --> 00:33:09,150
Hey, guys!

442
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,250
That's my camera.

443
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,200
The battery's dead.

444
00:33:23,299 --> 00:33:25,200
I've got an idea.

445
00:33:26,099 --> 00:33:27,750
Let me have the camera.

446
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,849
<i>Where were you on that one, Ma?</i>

447
00:33:33,950 --> 00:33:36,200
<i>Okay, dive, dive, dive.</i>

448
00:33:38,750 --> 00:33:39,950
<i>Come on, Ma.</i>

449
00:33:40,049 --> 00:33:41,099
<i>Eric!</i>

450
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,700
<i>Ma, you were supposed to catch it!</i>

451
00:33:43,099 --> 00:33:45,799
I shot this the morning they disappeared.

452
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,799
<i>Hey, no, no, no, I want that.
Hey, let me take that. Let me take that.</i>

453
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:51,099
<i>Hey, come on, give me that.
Come on, baby.</i>

454
00:33:51,250 --> 00:33:55,049
<i>- See anything yet?
- No, not yet!</i>

455
00:33:56,099 --> 00:33:57,650
<i>What was that?</i>

456
00:33:59,349 --> 00:34:02,750
<i>Unclip us. There's a clip! There's a big clip!</i>

457
00:34:02,849 --> 00:34:04,450
<i>I can't see! I can't do it!</i>

458
00:34:07,150 --> 00:34:09,050
<i>Look, I'm gonna unhook you, all right?</i>

459
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,900
<i>One, two, three!</i>

460
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,500
<i>Are you okay, buddy?
Okay, I'm gonna drop myself down now.</i>

461
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:19,199
<i>The camera's still on.</i>

462
00:34:22,250 --> 00:34:25,050
He's alive. I know he's alive.

463
00:34:25,349 --> 00:34:26,949
We're gonna find him.

464
00:34:29,599 --> 00:34:31,650
Can you fly one of those?

465
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,349
Maybe.

466
00:34:33,449 --> 00:34:35,500
As long as the sail is not torn.

467
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,300
Well, let's take it.

468
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:40,650
If we spot a plane, it might be
a good way to get attention.

469
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:42,449
Pull it over this way.

470
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:53,699
- I got it, I got it, hold on!
- Get it off of me!

471
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,199
- Okay, okay.
- Oh, my God!

472
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:59,000
Mrs. Kirby, please. Mrs. Kirby!

473
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,150
Okay, okay, you're free, you're free.

474
00:35:07,699 --> 00:35:09,699
Get her back, Mr. Kirby.

475
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,400
Amanda!

476
00:35:11,949 --> 00:35:13,050
Wait!

477
00:35:24,150 --> 00:35:25,599
Amanda!

478
00:35:31,099 --> 00:35:33,500
Amanda!

479
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:36,300
Amanda, stop, stop, stop.

480
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,449
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry about Ben.

481
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:45,949
It's not Ben, Paul.

482
00:35:47,099 --> 00:35:50,199
It's Eric. He's out there all by himself.

483
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,349
I know, I know.

484
00:35:53,449 --> 00:35:56,699
Our baby is out here all by himself.

485
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,349
Listen to me. We'll find him.

486
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:01,250
I promise.

487
00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:10,099
Paul.

488
00:36:13,849 --> 00:36:15,599
Dr. Grant!

489
00:36:16,550 --> 00:36:18,650
You should come look at this!

490
00:36:49,849 --> 00:36:51,150
Raptor.

491
00:37:03,449 --> 00:37:05,050
We're gonna find him.

492
00:37:05,150 --> 00:37:07,650
Are you listening to me?
We're gonna find him.

493
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:09,500
Kid's got resources.

494
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,000
Remember what it was like
to try to ground him?

495
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,650
Where's Billy?

496
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,949
What are you doing?

497
00:37:24,099 --> 00:37:25,800
I was photographing the nest.

498
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:27,949
Don't do that again.

499
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:30,099
I'm sorry.

500
00:37:31,349 --> 00:37:34,349
If I lose you, it's just me
and the damn tourists.

501
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:44,800
I bet you Eric's in there.

502
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:47,449
Don't you think? I'd bet my bottom dollar!

503
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,900
What do you think it is?

504
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:54,349
As far as I'm concerned,
it's the Four Seasons.

505
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:32,099
Eric!

506
00:38:32,199 --> 00:38:33,699
Paul! Don't!

507
00:38:43,050 --> 00:38:44,849
What the hell.

508
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,699
Who's got some change?
It only takes quarters.

509
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:06,250
I've got a buck-10.

510
00:40:01,849 --> 00:40:03,949
This is how you make dinosaurs?

511
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,550
No.

512
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,699
This is how you play God.

513
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,949
This way! This way!

514
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,449
It's locked!

515
00:41:16,199 --> 00:41:17,699
- This way, this way, this way!
- Go, go, go!

516
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,900
Hey, over here!

517
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,300
Push, push!

518
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:56,949
My God!

519
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:00,099
He's calling for help!

520
00:42:00,599 --> 00:42:02,050
Come on!

521
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,750
Into the herd!

522
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,349
Head for the trees!

523
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:25,500
Udesky.

524
00:43:44,699 --> 00:43:46,099
Mr. Kirby!

525
00:43:47,699 --> 00:43:48,800
Billy!

526
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:50,099
Is Alan with you?

527
00:43:57,500 --> 00:43:59,150
Oh, my God!

528
00:43:59,250 --> 00:44:00,900
Mr. Udesky!

529
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:03,500
Mr. Udesky!

530
00:44:04,199 --> 00:44:05,400
He's dead.

531
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:08,849
Oh, my God! No, he's not!

532
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:10,650
No, no, no, wait, wait.
Something's not right.

533
00:44:10,750 --> 00:44:11,900
We've got to help him.

534
00:44:12,599 --> 00:44:13,800
Amanda!

535
00:44:19,349 --> 00:44:20,449
Hold on!

536
00:44:28,250 --> 00:44:29,599
They set a trap.

537
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,199
They actually set a trap.

538
00:44:37,949 --> 00:44:39,449
What are you saying?

539
00:44:40,349 --> 00:44:42,000
What are you looking for?

540
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:55,400
Wait!

541
00:46:11,500 --> 00:46:12,699
Thanks.

542
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:14,800
Thanks a lot, Eric.

543
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,650
- You know who I am?
- Yeah.

544
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,349
Your parents are here.
They're looking for you.

545
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,300
Together?

546
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,900
Together.

547
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,300
That's not good.

548
00:46:31,400 --> 00:46:33,400
They don't do so well together.

549
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,750
You'd be surprised what people
can do when they have to.

550
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:54,849
You're Alan Grant.

551
00:46:56,449 --> 00:46:58,150
What are you doing here?

552
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:01,699
Your parents...

553
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:04,800
invited me along.

554
00:47:28,449 --> 00:47:30,199
I read both of your books.

555
00:47:31,699 --> 00:47:33,500
I liked the first one more.

556
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,800
Before you were on the island.

557
00:47:36,650 --> 00:47:38,650
You liked dinosaurs back then.

558
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:41,849
Back then, they hadn't tried to eat me yet.

559
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:48,050
When InGen cleared out,
they left a lot of stuff behind.

560
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:49,250
Any weapons?

561
00:47:49,349 --> 00:47:52,199
No, and I just used
the last of the gas grenades.

562
00:47:52,599 --> 00:47:54,000
And I appreciate that.

563
00:47:57,849 --> 00:48:00,099
Be careful with that. T-Rex.

564
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:02,300
It scares some of the smaller ones away,

565
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,949
but it attracts one really big one with a fin.

566
00:48:05,699 --> 00:48:07,699
This is T-Rex pee?

567
00:48:11,150 --> 00:48:12,550
How did you get it?

568
00:48:12,650 --> 00:48:14,349
You don't wanna know.

569
00:48:19,949 --> 00:48:21,750
- Dessert?
- Sure.

570
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:27,849
Eric, I have to tell you,

571
00:48:27,949 --> 00:48:31,050
I'm astonished that you've lasted
8 weeks on this island.

572
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:34,650
Is that all it's been?

573
00:48:35,949 --> 00:48:38,599
Well, you're alive,
and that's the important thing.

574
00:48:39,050 --> 00:48:41,949
Thanks to you, that's one thing
that we have in common.

575
00:48:44,650 --> 00:48:46,750
Did you read Malcolm's book?

576
00:48:47,599 --> 00:48:48,800
Yeah.

577
00:48:50,199 --> 00:48:51,300
So?

578
00:48:51,699 --> 00:48:53,400
I don't know. I mean...

579
00:48:53,849 --> 00:48:55,550
It was kind of preachy.

580
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:58,699
And too much chaos. Everything is chaos.

581
00:48:59,099 --> 00:49:01,500
Seemed like the guy was
kind of high on himself.

582
00:49:03,750 --> 00:49:06,550
That's two things that we have in common.

583
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:14,199
Listen.

584
00:49:14,900 --> 00:49:16,099
Compys!

585
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:29,699
Alan!

586
00:49:31,800 --> 00:49:33,000
Alan!

587
00:49:41,150 --> 00:49:42,449
Alan!

588
00:49:58,349 --> 00:50:01,750
No matter how this turns out,
it wasn't your fault.

589
00:50:03,099 --> 00:50:05,400
Eric's always been a strong-willed kid.

590
00:50:05,699 --> 00:50:06,800
Always.

591
00:50:06,900 --> 00:50:11,000
Then you throw someone like
Ben Hildebrand into the mix...

592
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:13,400
Well...

593
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:15,699
Well, what?

594
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,949
All I'm saying is, it's not your fault.

595
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,500
No.

596
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:27,400
If he'd been with you,
he'd be completely safe.

597
00:50:28,349 --> 00:50:31,300
You drive 5 miles under the speed limit, Paul.

598
00:50:32,699 --> 00:50:35,300
And I've totaled three cars in three years.

599
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:39,750
Well, not three.
The Buick wasn't really totaled.

600
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:44,300
I just said it was,
'cause I wanted to get the S.U.V.

601
00:50:49,250 --> 00:50:51,800
I am so sorry that you have to be here.

602
00:50:54,949 --> 00:50:55,949
I'm not.

603
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:16,050
Yeah, there is a boat.
Right alongside the bank.

604
00:52:16,199 --> 00:52:17,300
Looks in good shape.

605
00:52:17,449 --> 00:52:18,500
Rescue boat?

606
00:52:18,900 --> 00:52:20,199
No, no.

607
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:22,900
Just something left behind.

608
00:52:23,199 --> 00:52:24,400
But it floats.

609
00:52:36,349 --> 00:52:37,900
We stick to the plan.

610
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:40,150
Head for the coast.

611
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:42,099
You're not gonna look for Dr. Grant?

612
00:52:42,199 --> 00:52:43,849
The coast was Alan's idea.

613
00:52:43,949 --> 00:52:45,650
If he's alive, that's where he's headed.

614
00:52:45,750 --> 00:52:46,800
I agree.

615
00:52:46,900 --> 00:52:48,250
What about Eric?

616
00:52:48,849 --> 00:52:50,300
Eric's a smart kid.

617
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:52,900
He probably knows he stands
his best chance by the coast.

618
00:52:53,050 --> 00:52:56,050
He figures all the big dinosaurs
are in the center of the island.

619
00:52:56,150 --> 00:52:57,400
Right?

620
00:52:58,900 --> 00:53:00,099
Sure.

621
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:08,750
You know what this is?

622
00:53:09,099 --> 00:53:11,300
That's a raptor claw. I used to have one.

623
00:53:11,900 --> 00:53:12,949
A fossil.

624
00:53:14,449 --> 00:53:15,650
Mine is new.

625
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,650
How much of the island did you explore?

626
00:53:20,150 --> 00:53:22,199
I stayed pretty close to the compound.

627
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,150
I figured if anyone came looking for me,

628
00:53:24,250 --> 00:53:25,949
that's where they'd start.

629
00:53:26,849 --> 00:53:29,099
We need to get to the coast.
That was the plan.

630
00:53:29,199 --> 00:53:30,300
Are you sure?

631
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:33,050
The closer you get to the water,
the bigger things get.

632
00:53:33,150 --> 00:53:35,750
Well, if we can find our way
down into the canyon,

633
00:53:35,849 --> 00:53:38,300
we can follow that river out to the coast.

634
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:41,150
After we find your parents.

635
00:53:41,699 --> 00:53:42,800
And then what?

636
00:53:43,449 --> 00:53:45,500
- One step at a time.
- Listen.

637
00:53:47,099 --> 00:53:48,699
What?

638
00:53:49,349 --> 00:53:51,500
That's my dad's satellite phone!

639
00:53:55,099 --> 00:53:56,599
Wait a minute. How do you know?

640
00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:00,400
"Kirby Paint and Tile Plus, in Westgate!"

641
00:54:01,150 --> 00:54:02,550
Dad!

642
00:54:02,900 --> 00:54:04,000
Mum!

643
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,199
Mum! Dad!

644
00:54:17,500 --> 00:54:18,650
<i>Mum!</i>

645
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:25,099
<i>Mum! Dad!</i>

646
00:54:25,949 --> 00:54:27,900
- Eric!
- Eric!

647
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Eric, this way!

648
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:31,699
Eric! Eric!

649
00:54:32,000 --> 00:54:34,500
Mum! Dad!

650
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,099
Eric!

651
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:40,699
Mum!

652
00:54:41,300 --> 00:54:44,199
Mum, Dad!

653
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:53,250
I knew it. My God!

654
00:54:53,849 --> 00:54:55,199
I knew it.

655
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:58,750
Oh, God! Oh, my God!

656
00:54:59,050 --> 00:55:00,849
Boy, am I glad to see you.

657
00:55:01,300 --> 00:55:02,900
Hey, you got my bag.

658
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:05,900
Yeah. Lucky strap.

659
00:55:07,199 --> 00:55:08,750
Want me to carry it?

660
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,250
We need to find a gap here.

661
00:55:14,099 --> 00:55:16,000
How did you know we were here?

662
00:55:16,099 --> 00:55:18,849
The phone. That stupid jingle
from the store. I heard it.

663
00:55:18,949 --> 00:55:21,099
- My phone?
- Yeah, your satellite phone.

664
00:55:21,199 --> 00:55:22,699
- Where is it?
- I don't have it.

665
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,550
When did you use it last?

666
00:55:25,050 --> 00:55:26,800
On the plane.

667
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:29,099
I got a call on the plane and...

668
00:55:30,099 --> 00:55:33,349
- What? What?
- I loaned it to Nash.

669
00:55:34,150 --> 00:55:36,000
He must have had it when he...

670
00:55:46,699 --> 00:55:47,849
Run.

671
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:54,650
Alan, you want to give me the bag back?

672
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:56,750
It's okay, Billy, I got it.

673
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,199
Please, give me the bag.

674
00:57:03,349 --> 00:57:04,550
It's not safe.

675
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:17,500
Raptor eggs.

676
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,500
Did you steal raptor eggs?

677
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:31,050
Now it all makes sense.

678
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:34,699
I swear, if I'd known that
you were gonna end up with them...

679
00:57:36,949 --> 00:57:38,050
I took them on an impulse.

680
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:39,449
I thought they'd be worth a fortune.

681
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:42,599
Enough to fund the dig site
another 10 more years.

682
00:57:42,699 --> 00:57:45,550
Look, you have to believe me.
This was a stupid decision,

683
00:57:45,650 --> 00:57:47,800
but I did it with the best intentions.

684
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:50,000
"With the best intentions."

685
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:54,500
Some of the worst things imaginable

686
00:57:54,599 --> 00:57:56,949
have been done with the best intentions.

687
00:57:58,050 --> 00:57:59,599
You know what, Billy?

688
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:01,599
As far as I'm concerned,

689
00:58:01,699 --> 00:58:04,750
you're no better than the people
that built this place.

690
00:58:22,050 --> 00:58:23,050
What are you doing?

691
00:58:23,150 --> 00:58:25,300
Those things are after us because of those.

692
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:28,900
Those things know we have the eggs.

693
00:58:29,300 --> 00:58:33,400
If I drop them in the river,
they'll still be after us.

694
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:35,849
What if they catch us with them?

695
00:58:35,949 --> 00:58:38,000
What if they catch us without them?

696
00:58:41,849 --> 00:58:44,150
There's a boat at the bottom, just downriver.

697
00:58:44,250 --> 00:58:46,949
We can try and make it to the coast at least.

698
00:59:42,650 --> 00:59:44,500
- You okay?
- Yeah.

699
00:59:55,699 --> 00:59:58,099
Let's do this one at a time, shall we?

700
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:38,199
Okay, come on over!

701
01:00:39,150 --> 01:00:40,550
One at a time!

702
01:00:40,750 --> 01:00:42,150
All right, Eric.

703
01:00:42,449 --> 01:00:44,599
I'm gonna leave you just for a minute, okay?

704
01:00:44,699 --> 01:00:46,550
And then you're gonna be
right behind me, okay?

705
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:47,750
Mum!

706
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:50,849
I've been alone in a water truck for 8 weeks.

707
01:00:50,949 --> 01:00:54,000
I think I can manage
the next two minutes without you.

708
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,300
Right, we're all together now.

709
01:01:25,699 --> 01:01:26,849
Okay, Eric.

710
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:28,599
- Okay.
- Come on, honey!

711
01:01:28,699 --> 01:01:29,900
Over you go.

712
01:02:03,800 --> 01:02:05,099
Mum?

713
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:08,750
Oh, my God!

714
01:02:09,250 --> 01:02:10,500
What is it?

715
01:02:11,099 --> 01:02:12,800
It's a birdcage.

716
01:02:13,500 --> 01:02:14,599
For what?

717
01:02:21,150 --> 01:02:22,349
Dad!

718
01:02:22,449 --> 01:02:23,550
Eric!

719
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,500
- Eric!
- Help me!

720
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:38,099
Eric!

721
01:02:40,599 --> 01:02:43,000
I can't see him!

722
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,000
Eric!

723
01:02:51,199 --> 01:02:52,400
No!

724
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:01,650
This way!

725
01:03:14,599 --> 01:03:16,500
Billy!

726
01:03:17,550 --> 01:03:18,800
Billy, stop!

727
01:03:19,500 --> 01:03:22,000
Billy, stop! Don't, Billy!

728
01:03:23,500 --> 01:03:25,000
Billy!

729
01:03:41,699 --> 01:03:43,400
Eric, hold on!

730
01:03:48,500 --> 01:03:49,599
Eric!

731
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:03,900
Jump!

732
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:31,949
Billy!

733
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:45,900
Let go now!

734
01:05:32,099 --> 01:05:33,500
- Eric!
- He's there.

735
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:42,500
Eric!

736
01:05:43,400 --> 01:05:44,599
Eric!

737
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:49,199
There he is! He's across the river!

738
01:05:49,449 --> 01:05:51,000
Get him out of here!

739
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,150
- No!
- Go, go, Eric!

740
01:05:55,550 --> 01:05:57,000
What about Billy?

741
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,250
Hang on, Billy!

742
01:06:26,900 --> 01:06:30,300
Get away!

743
01:07:53,300 --> 01:07:55,099
There's plenty of gasoline.

744
01:07:55,300 --> 01:07:58,199
Now we've just got to
make our way to the coast.

745
01:07:58,650 --> 01:08:01,150
Work out some sort of a signal.

746
01:08:01,800 --> 01:08:05,349
Build a fire or something.
Something they can see from the air.

747
01:08:11,400 --> 01:08:12,599
Dr. Grant?

748
01:08:14,349 --> 01:08:16,300
Hey, Eric, how're you doing?

749
01:08:26,250 --> 01:08:27,850
I'm sorry about Billy.

750
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:34,550
You know what the last thing
I said to him was?

751
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:36,300
I said...

752
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:39,750
"You're as bad as the people
that built this place."

753
01:08:40,199 --> 01:08:45,300
Which wasn't true.
Billy was just young. That's all.

754
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:50,250
I have a theory that there are
two kinds of boys.

755
01:08:50,350 --> 01:08:52,449
There are those who want to be astronomers

756
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:55,000
and those who want to be astronauts.

757
01:08:55,550 --> 01:08:58,449
The astronomer or the paleontologist

758
01:08:58,550 --> 01:09:02,100
gets to study these amazing things

759
01:09:02,199 --> 01:09:04,199
from a place of complete safety.

760
01:09:04,899 --> 01:09:07,000
But then you never get to go into space.

761
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:08,449
Exactly.

762
01:09:08,899 --> 01:09:11,899
It's the difference between
imagining and seeing.

763
01:09:12,000 --> 01:09:14,550
To be able to touch them.

764
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:19,300
And that's... all Billy wanted.

765
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:27,550
Dr. Grant.

766
01:09:56,649 --> 01:09:58,649
You know something, Dr. Grant?

767
01:10:00,449 --> 01:10:01,800
Billy was right.

768
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:28,899
Listen.

769
01:10:49,850 --> 01:10:51,550
Find it before it stops ringing!

770
01:10:51,649 --> 01:10:53,600
Eric, you stay on that boat.

771
01:10:56,550 --> 01:10:58,750
It's here. Whoa, whoa, whoa! It's here.

772
01:11:00,250 --> 01:11:01,500
God!

773
01:11:08,500 --> 01:11:09,699
I got it.

774
01:11:17,899 --> 01:11:19,500
Hello? Hello?

775
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:22,949
<i>You, too, can own a timeshare
in beautiful Guadalajara.</i>

776
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:25,899
<i>Enjoy a meal in one of
our four-star restaurants.</i>

777
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:27,050
Look out!

778
01:11:47,149 --> 01:11:49,000
Turn off the power.

779
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:51,000
You've got juice for maybe one call.

780
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:53,500
Whatever you do,
don't call the U.S. Embassy.

781
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,250
They won't do a damn thing.

782
01:11:55,550 --> 01:11:58,100
Hey, guys, come here! Look at this!

783
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,250
Bonitos.

784
01:12:06,399 --> 01:12:08,199
Something must have spooked them.

785
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:10,600
Get the engine going, Mr. Kirby.

786
01:12:18,100 --> 01:12:19,600
Open the throttle.

787
01:12:26,500 --> 01:12:28,000
Pick up. Pick up.

788
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:33,850
Hello?

789
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:35,300
Ellie?

790
01:12:35,600 --> 01:12:36,750
Hello?

791
01:12:37,149 --> 01:12:38,199
Charlie!

792
01:12:39,149 --> 01:12:41,000
- Charlie!
- <i>Hello?</i>

793
01:12:41,649 --> 01:12:44,600
Charlie, take the phone to Mummy now!

794
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:47,199
<i>Take the phone to Mummy!</i>

795
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:49,800
It's the dinosaur man!

796
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:51,300
Okay.

797
01:12:51,449 --> 01:12:52,699
<i>Listen to me, Charlie.</i>

798
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:54,800
Charlie!

799
01:12:55,800 --> 01:12:57,500
Are you taking the phone to Mum?

800
01:12:57,800 --> 01:12:59,000
Charlie!

801
01:13:28,250 --> 01:13:29,699
<i>Hi, everybody!</i>

802
01:13:39,350 --> 01:13:40,949
<i>It's great to be here!</i>

803
01:13:41,050 --> 01:13:44,000
<i>Hi, there! Hi! How are you today?</i>

804
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:55,000
<i>This is gonna be great!</i>

805
01:14:07,699 --> 01:14:09,949
- Who's on the phone?
- The dinosaur man.

806
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:11,850
He is? Alan?

807
01:14:11,949 --> 01:14:14,899
Look in the boxes! Look in the boxes!
Find a weapon!

808
01:14:22,699 --> 01:14:23,850
Where's the phone?

809
01:14:23,949 --> 01:14:25,600
- There! There!
- Get the phone!

810
01:14:35,399 --> 01:14:37,100
Ellie, Ellie, listen to me!

811
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:39,449
Alan, are you on a cell phone?
I can't hear you.

812
01:14:39,550 --> 01:14:42,750
The river! Site B! The river!

813
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:46,800
Hello?

814
01:15:49,399 --> 01:15:52,000
Hey!

815
01:16:04,699 --> 01:16:05,800
Hey!

816
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:54,500
Dad!

817
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,300
Dad!

818
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,000
Dad!

819
01:17:19,899 --> 01:17:22,000
Paul, you jerk!

820
01:17:24,449 --> 01:17:26,399
You can't leave me like this!

821
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:30,750
I'm not going anywhere!

822
01:17:47,250 --> 01:17:50,350
Remember when we went fishing
a couple of summers ago?

823
01:17:51,149 --> 01:17:54,449
I was putting the boat in the water
and the trailer sank?

824
01:17:55,399 --> 01:17:58,949
The tow truck tried to pull us out
and it got dragged in, too.

825
01:17:59,949 --> 01:18:02,649
The truck driver wanted
to knock my lights out.

826
01:18:08,250 --> 01:18:09,600
I miss fishing.

827
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:16,699
Mr. Kirby?

828
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:24,500
That lady you called. Who is she?

829
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:27,250
How do you know that she can help us?

830
01:18:27,350 --> 01:18:29,350
She was the one person
I could always count on.

831
01:18:29,449 --> 01:18:30,649
I owe her a lot.

832
01:18:31,800 --> 01:18:33,699
I don't think I ever told her that.

833
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:34,899
You should.

834
01:18:37,850 --> 01:18:39,149
You hear that?

835
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:41,949
The ocean.

836
01:18:58,750 --> 01:19:00,250
They want the eggs.

837
01:19:01,350 --> 01:19:03,500
Otherwise, we'd be dead already.

838
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:12,199
Everybody get down.
She's challenging us.

839
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:33,250
She thinks you stole the eggs.

840
01:19:33,350 --> 01:19:34,550
Get behind me.

841
01:19:54,850 --> 01:19:57,899
Give me the eggs.

842
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:19,899
Do it, Mum.

843
01:20:38,750 --> 01:20:40,800
No. No, no, no. Call for help.

844
01:21:27,449 --> 01:21:28,949
That's a helicopter.

845
01:21:38,649 --> 01:21:41,699
Dr. Grant? Dr. Alan Grant?

846
01:21:41,800 --> 01:21:43,250
- No!
- Stop!

847
01:21:43,350 --> 01:21:45,899
- That's a very bad idea!
- That's a very bad idea!

848
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:55,899
Second squad, move!

849
01:21:56,000 --> 01:21:57,000
Wow!

850
01:21:57,449 --> 01:22:01,100
You have to thank her now.
She sent the Navy and the Marines.

851
01:22:02,850 --> 01:22:04,600
God bless you, Ellie.

852
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:17,800
- Dr. Grant?
- Yeah?

853
01:22:17,899 --> 01:22:19,199
- Is this man with you?
- What?

854
01:22:29,300 --> 01:22:30,800
Hey, you made it.

855
01:22:32,050 --> 01:22:33,250
Yeah.

856
01:22:34,250 --> 01:22:36,000
I rescued your hat.

857
01:22:36,850 --> 01:22:38,550
Dr. Grant, we need to go now.

858
01:22:38,649 --> 01:22:39,949
Oh, yeah.

859
01:22:42,300 --> 01:22:44,449
Well, that's the important thing.

860
01:22:45,050 --> 01:22:46,149
Dr. Grant!

861
01:22:48,699 --> 01:22:51,399
Can I get you to sit here and buckle up, sir?

862
01:22:58,250 --> 01:23:01,800
<i>Sea Shadow to Dust Storm,
be advised, six souls on board.</i>

863
01:23:03,550 --> 01:23:05,649
<i>Dust Storm to Sea Shadow, roger.</i>

864
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:11,949
What the hell is that?

865
01:23:13,250 --> 01:23:14,800
Dr. Grant, look!

866
01:23:24,750 --> 01:23:26,750
Where do you think they're going?

867
01:23:27,649 --> 01:23:30,649
I don't know. Maybe just looking
for new nesting grounds.

868
01:23:30,750 --> 01:23:32,750
It's a whole new world for them.

869
01:23:32,850 --> 01:23:35,449
I dare them to nest in Enid, Oklahoma.

870
01:23:42,199 --> 01:23:43,449
Let's go home.
