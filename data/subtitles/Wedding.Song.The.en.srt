00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,139
<i>"The bride has blackened her eyelashes"</i>

2
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,571
<i>"and made up her lips"</i>

3
00:00:46,940 --> 00:00:51,218
<i>"She was to the bathroom and colored her hair."</i>

4
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:56,653
<i>"She has put on her most beautiful dress  </i>

5
00:00:56,654 --> 00:00:57,654
and all her bracelets

6
00:00:56,860 --> 00:01:02,018
<i>But she is still missing something</i>

7
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:03,219
What is it?

8
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:03,773
-Her ring.
-No.

9
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,379
Her earrings.
-No.

10
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:08,697
<i>"The bride has blackened her eyelashes"</i>

11
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:14,936
<i>"And made up her lips... </i>

12
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:21,592
-You're so lucky.

13
00:01:21,693 --> 00:01:25,493
Don't worry, Myriam,
you'll get engaged too.

14
00:01:27,940 --> 00:01:30,691
Which one is he?

15
00:01:30,692 --> 00:01:31,692
Guess!

16
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:36,171
-That's him
-Bingo!

17
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:39,799
What do you think?

18
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:44,500
He's just how I imagined him.

19
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:24,290
I'm bringing them to you.

20
00:02:50,013 --> 00:02:52,013
May your girl Myriam
be next on the list!

21
00:02:52,693 --> 00:02:54,693
All our friends are here.

22
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,453
Come on, let's hear it
for Nour and Khaled.

23
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:05,652
Look at it, look at it.
You're the fiancée!

24
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,932
Don't be ashamed!

25
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,076
-Nour, when is the wedding?

26
00:03:16,077 --> 00:03:18,577
We'll wait until Khaled finds work.

27
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,790
Don't wait too long!.

28
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:22,791
My neighbour was engaged
for 10 years. Her fiance died.

29
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:26,398
She doesn't even have
a sheep for comfort now!

30
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,779
Take care.

31
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,052
-Come on, Antonietta!
No, I prefer Italian things.

32
00:03:31,953 --> 00:03:34,053
Touch it, you'll like it!

33
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,812
To the grand Mufti of Jerusalem,

34
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:38,011
The German National Socalists

35
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,929
have always fought
against world Jewry.

36
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:45,831
They support
the Arabs' struggle for freedom.

37
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:47,932
notably in Palestine

38
00:04:47,933 --> 00:04:48,933
against the Jewish interlopers.

39
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,120
THE WEDDING SONG

40
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,850
-How much are the tomatoes?
-Twenty centimes.

41
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,891
That's too expensive.

42
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,737
I don't have enough money..

43
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,331
Come on, let's go..

44
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,890
Oh, those Germans...
I've never seen men like them.

45
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,169
They are well-mannered.

46
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,612
and have blond hair and blue eyes.

47
00:06:16,513 --> 00:06:19,513
Quite frankly, if one approaches me,
I won't let him go.

48
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,332
-Me neither

49
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,531
What did you study at school today?

50
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,514
-Nothing.

51
00:06:24,515 --> 00:06:26,515
She's been expelled!

52
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:29,016
As if me being fired
wasn't enough!

53
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,670
She picked a bad day for it!

54
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,737
-You've got nothing to teach me?
-You know all you need.

55
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:40,376
You can sew and cook.
Khaled will be happy with that.

56
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,693
-My mother drives me mad.
-So does mine.

57
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:03,968
Say...
I've wanted to ask for a year now

58
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,972
But I don't dare.

59
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,894
Go on.  Say it!

60
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:11,770
Why did your mother lose her job?

61
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,731
Because of the French...

62
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,779
Why?

63
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:20,851
I don't know.
They don't like us anymore.

64
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:23,500
Tita!

65
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,779
Come here.

66
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:33,258
I hear you haven't paid?

67
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:36,737
I said I'd  pay next time.
You know to our situation!

68
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,940
You always say that!

69
00:07:38,941 --> 00:07:42,017
You're like a sister to me
but I'm going to get angry.

70
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:44,572
Next time,
no money, no bath!

71
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:50,572
I'll will bring the money next time.

72
00:07:50,573 --> 00:07:52,973
On my husband's grave,
I'll bring it!

73
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:59,858
<i>It is difficult pull out a cent out of a Jew!</i>

74
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:02,859
There're worse than the French!

75
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:08,656
Let's hope the Germans win the war
and rid us of the French!

76
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:13,492
They're going to win.

77
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,218
They're going to win.

78
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,100
Myriam!

79
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,816
-Everything OK?
-Fine.

80
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:45,173
And you?

81
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,532
I can't sleep.

82
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,333
Me neither.

83
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:59,210
Want to sleep in my room?

84
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:03,453
Wait for me.

85
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,456
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

86
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,332
Good morning.

87
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,614
Nour?

88
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,097
Come here, my girl!

89
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:07,696
Take this to Tita.

90
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,393
Husband

91
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,131
I wish to talk to you.

92
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,752
-What's the matter?

93
00:11:23,753 --> 00:11:26,853
-Khaled want to know
the date about the wedding.

94
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:29,769
-Has he found work?
-No, not yet.

95
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,578
-No work, no wedding!

96
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:35,879
Come on, he's our cousin!

97
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:41,172
How will he provide for her?
No work, no wedding.

98
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,376
May God forgive me!

99
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,252
What are they doing?

100
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:25,650
-They're laughing.  Really?

101
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:28,728
Come and help me now!

102
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:34,971
There are dresses in my room.

103
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:45,759
-Antonietta!

104
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,860
-Yes, dear.

105
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:51,376
I'll sew it
so you can pay the grocer back.

106
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:58,055
-Tita?
-Yes.

107
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,613
-My mum sent this.
-Thank you, Nour.

108
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:04,172
What's wrong?

109
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:09,573
You haven't turned the radio on
for us this morning?

110
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,050
Come on.

111
00:13:13,620 --> 00:13:15,576
Come with me.

112
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,058
Come let Tita cuddle you.

113
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,497
Ah, Nour, the world is cruel.

114
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:40,859
Wait here, I'lll get you
some  Molokheya.

115
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,417
What's wrong?

116
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:52,210
I need your help.
I have to see Khaled.

117
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,129
Can you help me?

118
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:08,570
What's that red dress?

119
00:14:08,571 --> 00:14:11,271
Try it on for the synagogue.
I prefer the blue one.

120
00:14:11,293 --> 00:14:12,899
No, it makes you look pale.

121
00:14:12,900 --> 00:14:14,572
-It doesn't.  -Enough!

122
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,137
-Heed my advice to attract Raoul.
-I don't want to.

123
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:21,059
You'll have to
after what you did at school.

124
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:25,299
Is this a time to sing songs
against Marshall Petain?.

125
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,975
Please Nour, tell her to try it on.

126
00:14:30,420 --> 00:14:32,349
It isn't sewn yet!

127
00:14:32,350 --> 00:14:34,250
You can finish it tomorrow.

128
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:36,535
No time.
I have to work with Nour.

129
00:14:37,660 --> 00:14:39,890
As if the Germans
will let you go back to school?

130
00:14:40,640 --> 00:14:42,159
The Allies will.

131
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,815
Sew away
while you wait for them.

132
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:54,488
Our concert today was brought

133
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:57,609
to you by the Galeries Barbes

134
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,378
and we hope that you enjoyed it.

135
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,038
Your satisfaction
is the goal of our store.

136
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:05,677
For you, we hire
the top music hall stars.

137
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,378
For you,

138
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:10,235
we have developed
our quick-dry wax polish,

139
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,200
the polish with the instant shine
Free catalogue.

140
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:18,720
I'm the little wooden man
from the Galeries Barbes...

141
00:15:20,011 --> 00:15:28,472
Anglo-American bombs again fell
on our dear Tunisia yesterday.

142
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:32,099
Since it is a war of Jewish origin,

143
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:35,116
especially the invasion
of North Africa

144
00:15:35,172 --> 00:15:37,320
organized by international Jewry,

145
00:15:37,321 --> 00:15:41,300
we thank the German authorities
for compensating the bombs' victims

146
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:45,541
by giving the Jewish community
a hefty fine.

147
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:48,100
Try to understand the huge threat

148
00:15:48,101 --> 00:15:51,230
that the Jews represent
wherever they live.

149
00:15:51,231 --> 00:15:55,260
The fine is set at the fair sum
of 20 million francs,

150
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:59,600
to be paid immediately
to avoid bloody reprisals.

151
00:15:59,601 --> 00:16:01,000
May God destroy them!

152
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,001
Jewry as a whole

153
00:16:02,801 --> 00:16:04,802
is the greatest and staunchest enemy

154
00:16:04,803 --> 00:16:07,503
of our cause and the Third Reich.

155
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,650
Wait in the living room

156
00:16:13,658 --> 00:16:15,658
Thank you.

157
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,538
Do you know Paris?

158
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,849
I studied medicine there.

159
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:41,850
I stayed until the occupation,
when I had to come back here.

160
00:16:44,420 --> 00:16:45,819
And you,

161
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,373
tell me things.

162
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:55,179
-What do you like to do?
-Nothing.

163
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:07,858
Do you like my house?

164
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:37,211
Not very talkative.

165
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:40,937
You were more outspoken at school!

166
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:45,133
How do you know about that?
-The entire city knows.

167
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,455
Go back and see him.

168
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:07,238
-Be nice to him.

169
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,539
I don't want to marry him.

170
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,612
When you're poor,
you can't be choosy.

171
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,971
You eat and stay quiet.

172
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:20,374
You want me to die in poverty?

173
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,494
This man was sent by God.

174
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,492
He'll bring you fame and joy.

175
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:43,335
And he'll help us pay the fine.

176
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:51,616
At first, I too thought
I didn't love your father.

177
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,338
And then...

178
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,937
I got to know him.

179
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:16,691
there's a war on.

180
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:33,370
Now ask your god about the fine.

We'll See.

184
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,657
If it doesn't work,
you'll have to ask Raoul.

185
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:56,300
You'll end up liking him one day.

186
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,294
No chance of that.

187
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:10,536
And he lives far away!

188
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:15,051
We won't be able to see each other?

189
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:16,650
First...

190
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:27,929
First of all...

191
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:14,138
Have you finished it?

192
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:17,858
-And the Arabian book?
-That too.

193
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:20,658
That's good

194
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:26,971
Have you found work?

195
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,412
Not yet.

196
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,870
You have to, Khaled!

197
00:24:32,900 --> 00:24:34,671
I know.

198
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,578
Why did you want to see me?

199
00:24:38,579 --> 00:24:41,579
My father
wants to call off the marriage.

200
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,739
Don't worry.

201
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:52,777
I'll soon find work.

202
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,413
I have to go.
Myriam will be worried.

203
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:46,258
-What's that?
-The Americans.

204
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:18,250
-This is for you.
- For me?

205
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,147
Think it's my size?

206
00:26:23,148 --> 00:26:24,148
Try it on.

207
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:28,696
You'll wear it when you see Khaled.

208
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,172
Fits perfectly.
Thank you.

209
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,170
Did you kiss Khaled last time?

210
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:22,338
-Yes.
-What's it like?

211
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,658

Where's the baker?

222
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,653
What do we do?
- I don't know.

223
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,691
They're not going to bomb us
every day.

Let's go..

231
00:30:16,060 --> 00:30:18,654
-She makes couscous without salt?.
-I asked her to.

232
00:30:18,860 --> 00:30:22,648
but she's such a scatterbrain.

233
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:26,648
Why so much oil?
I told you already.

234
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,920
-Sorry. ma'am.

235
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,517
They never understand a thing.

236
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:34,078
These natives are a disaster..

237
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:36,279
Calm down.
The roundups make her edgy.

238
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:39,497
-This is terrible service!
I'll see to it....

239
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:42,897
-Mother, it doesn't matter!.
-You always say that.

240
00:30:43,100 --> 00:30:45,360
She hasn't given us spoons.

241
00:30:45,361 --> 00:30:47,561
It's all right. Let's eat.

242
00:30:47,562 --> 00:30:50,062
Fire her if you're not happy.

243
00:30:49,564 --> 00:30:52,359
Every meal,
we talk about the maid!

244
00:30:52,764 --> 00:30:53,860
Can we eat?

245
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:56,698
-The meatballs are good.

246
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,775
-I haven't had meat.
since the war began.

247
00:30:58,776 --> 00:31:00,076
We'll have it
at the wedding.

248
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,096
We need your guest list.

249
00:31:02,097 --> 00:31:03,225
Only family.

250
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:07,012
With this fine to pay
we need to cut back.

251
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,989
-I don't know how to pay.
Don't worry.

252
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,990
Thank you, Raoul.

253
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,338
-I'm sorry, but I will leave
after the lunch.

254
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,916
-I have a patient later too.

255
00:31:24,017 --> 00:31:25,817
Why does the hospital
give you so much work?

256
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,490
I'm lucky I kept my job!

257
00:31:28,700 --> 00:31:31,498
Thanks to you, Sid Mustapha.

258
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,295
- God bless you.
-The pleasure is all mine, lady.

259
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:37,855
Three other doctors backed me up.

260
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,972
And I left France
to be safe here!.

261
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,330
Such a pity....

262
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,736
Sid Mustapha, what do you think of
the political situation?

263
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:55,334
No one is fooled by the Nazi propaganda.

264
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,540
Grave?

265
00:31:56,660 --> 00:32:00,096
The Communists have asked me
to contact the Nationalists.

266
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:03,614
We'd like them to take a stand
against the Axis.

267
00:32:03,820 --> 00:32:05,811
I think they will.

268
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:09,333
We share the same goal:
independence of the Tunisia.

269
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:11,159
-I saw Moslems pick up pamphlets.

270
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:14,460
Help my mother clear the table.

271
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,296
May I take your plate now?

272
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:25,329
-Yes, the fine's spoiled my appetite.
-We'll sort it out.

273
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,538
Thank you, Raoul.

274
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,289
-Excuse her.
-Where are you going?

275
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:33,456
What's happening?

276
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:36,178
Come back for the table.

277
00:32:40,940 --> 00:32:43,693
Make an an effort, dear.

278
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,571
You don't understand.

279
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,457
There's a war on.

280
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,099
You're very beautiful..

281
00:33:57,020 --> 00:33:58,089
-do you know her?
-Yes.

282
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:03,454
Could she wait outside?
I don't want customers seeing a native here.

283
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,129
Raoul!

284
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,729
Nour!

285
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:59,175
Show me what your Raoul bought you.

286
00:35:01,860 --> 00:35:03,657
It's beautiful!

287
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:10,254
You're so lucky.  Khaled never buys me anything.

288
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,974
Don't worry,
He'll buy you presents one day.

289
00:35:13,975 --> 00:35:14,975
We'll see.

290
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:21,773
-He still hasn't found work?
-It's hard right now.

291
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,216
It's hard for us too.

292
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:39,658
-Here, you have it.
-No keep it.

293
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,892
-Take it
-No, it's a gift.

294
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,658
Please, take it.

295
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:46,099
What about Raoul?

296
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,571
I'll say I lost it.

297
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:51,937
-He won't believe you.
-He will, don't worry.

298
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:56,451
What about me?
What do I tell Khaled?

299
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,298
I don't know.

300
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,258
Say you found it.

301
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:08,771
Found it while collecting some pamphlets.

302
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,013
That's true.

303
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,095
Can I ask you something?

304
00:36:23,140 --> 00:36:24,459
Yes.

305
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,376
I'd like to see Khaled again.

306
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,293
All right.

307
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,571
Don't worry,
I'll get myself a pass.

308
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,850
-You can?
-Yes.

309
00:36:56,060 --> 00:36:59,848
And I'll even get work.
and money.

310
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:03,894
- Have you told my father?
- No, not yet.

311
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,459
Does March suit you?

312
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,969
- For what?
- Our wedding.

313
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:36,777
Your eyes, your lips...

314
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:42,179
Come here.
- No.

315
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:52,888
- I've been waiting for years.
- Like everyone.

316
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,172
Let me, please.

317
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:59,135
I beg you, my love.

318
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,608
-Don't you love me anymore?
-Yes. I love you.

319
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,012
Forgive me.

320
00:38:19,750 --> 00:38:23,030
-Tell me about
when you first saw me..

321
00:38:23,031 --> 00:38:25,031
I already told you.

322
00:38:25,032 --> 00:38:27,032
Tell me again.

323
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,615
-Come on tell me.

324
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:39,400
As soon as I saw you,
I knew you were the one.

325
00:38:39,401 --> 00:38:41,128
And then?

326
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,700
Then, my father told me

327
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:47,060
you were the cousin I'd marry.

328
00:38:47,061 --> 00:38:49,121
But I already knew it was you.

329
00:38:49,122 --> 00:38:51,122
How do you know?

330
00:38:51,123 --> 00:38:54,469
-I was trembling.
-And now?

331
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:59,570
-Yes.

332
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:01,618
Don't be afraid.

333
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:53,819
Here I am.

334
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,293
What are you doing?

335
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:06,973
Who is that?

336
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,571
Who is that, Myriam?

337
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,658
Have you done it?

338
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:23,094
My God,
my daughter is a slut!

339
00:40:25,740 --> 00:40:29,528
-What will I tell Raoul now?
-I don't want to  marry him.

340
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:31,049
Shut up!

341
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,654
If your father was alive,
he'd slap your face!

342
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,619
He'd never marry me
to a man I hate!

343
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:37,777
Shut up, you whore!

344
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:56,576
Seen this?  It's all spoiled.

345
00:41:01,420 --> 00:41:03,331
I'll buy you another one.

346
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:09,410
When do you start work?

347
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:14,258
I don't know.

348
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,454
Tomorrow,
I have to go to the "Kommandantur".

349
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:28,890
You're working for the Germans?

350
00:41:29,180 --> 00:41:30,659
Yes.

351
00:41:31,540 --> 00:41:33,656
They're decent people.

352
00:41:34,180 --> 00:41:36,740
They've promised us independence
after the war.

353
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:40,172
I didn't know that.

354
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:44,533
There are a lot of things
you don't know.

355
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,932
I'll teach you.

356
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:02,613
Who is he?

357
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,533
-What did you do with him?
-Everything.

358
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,533
Meaning?

359
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:26,930
Everything. He lay down on me,
blew in my mouth and..

360
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,978
Ah Myriam...

361
00:42:45,380 --> 00:42:48,531
Give this to your mother,
for the wedding expenses.

362
00:43:11,660 --> 00:43:15,016
-Well?
-I've sorted it out.

363
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,017
Thank you, you've saved us.

364
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:20,495
There's no problem.
Everything is fine.

365
00:43:22,260 --> 00:43:24,091
No problem, Tita!

366
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:32,688
I forgot to ask you
for the wedding night...

367
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:37,139
Do you want the bride
Oriental or European style?

368
00:43:37,355 --> 00:43:38,855
Oriental...

369
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:43,870
Oriental.

370
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:39,811
Be brave, you have to be beautiful
for your wedding night.

371
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:46,214
How did it go with Khaled
the other night?

372
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,290
-He found work!
-What kind of work?

373
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:52,818
He didn't say.

374
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:55,899
Stand up!

375
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:12,596
I have a friend
whose jealous neighbour

376
00:45:12,700 --> 00:45:14,700
wanted her fiance.

377
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:17,710
On the wedding night
she cast a spell:

378
00:45:17,911 --> 00:45:20,011
and she became like a baby!

379
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:27,015
Didn't the father kill her
when he saw the unstained sheet?

380
00:45:27,020 --> 00:45:30,610
The poor man lived with the shame
all his life!

381
00:45:30,620 --> 00:45:35,138
-Which family was it?
-The whole neighborhood knows!

382
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:37,251
I know who it is.

383
00:46:01,540 --> 00:46:05,215
You have to be clean
to please your husband.

384
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:07,058
Don't be afraid.

385
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:34,376
Your husband
wants you as soft as silk.

386
00:47:03,820 --> 00:47:05,731
It's all right, it's all right.

387
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:14,655
Relax, the pain will pass.

388
00:47:37,600 --> 00:47:39,592
Everything's fine.

389
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:02,012
You see, your skin is silky.

390
00:48:15,220 --> 00:48:16,858
There, it's all over.

391
00:48:46,100 --> 00:48:49,100
I have to tell her and show her.

392
00:49:10,250 --> 00:49:11,750
Answer!

393
00:49:12,271 --> 00:49:14,499
Where are your children?
Your husband?

394
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:17,011
I don't know,
I don't understand French.

395
00:49:17,300 --> 00:49:19,915
-What did she say?
-She doesn't speak French.

396
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:23,266
For hostages,
it's best to take men.

397
00:49:23,640 --> 00:49:26,379
Where's her family?

398
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,176
There's no one else.  My husband is dead

399
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,939
and  my daughter's married.

400
00:49:32,000 --> 00:49:35,736
-She  lives alone.
-Is that true?

401
00:49:35,737 --> 00:49:36,737
No, she has a daughter.

402
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,034
But she isn't home from school yet.

403
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,160
I beg you...

404
00:49:44,176 --> 00:49:47,699
I've done nothing,
I've paid the fine, I...

405
00:49:47,700 --> 00:49:49,700
-We'll come back.

406
00:49:52,100 --> 00:49:55,133
What do we do?
Search the place

407
00:49:55,540 --> 00:49:58,934
Take the jewels,
money and sewing machine.

408
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,894
-There's nothing.
-They hide everything.

409
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,377
Bitch!

410
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,739
Good morning, Myriam, everything well?

411
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:00,138
Good morning.

412
00:53:01,260 --> 00:53:02,613
Everything well?

413
00:53:03,060 --> 00:53:04,459
Everything well.

414
00:53:06,060 --> 00:53:09,530
What's wrong with her?
I don't understand.

415
00:53:10,020 --> 00:53:12,250
God only knows, my daughter.

416
00:53:26,060 --> 00:53:29,018
-What are doing here?
-Nothing.

417
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:34,014
Why did you pick
those leaflets up on the square?

418
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,778
I was curious.

419
00:53:41,740 --> 00:53:45,528
Has Khaled told you about his work?
No.

420
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:48,735
-Nothing?
-No.

421
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:52,338
He came to our place
with the Germans and French.

422
00:53:53,540 --> 00:53:56,771
They stole from us
and hurt my mother.

423
00:53:57,080 --> 00:53:59,336
-He did wrong nothing.
-I saw him with them

424
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:01,296
-It wasn't him!
-I saw him.

425
00:54:01,700 --> 00:54:05,932
You saw wrong.
What do you have against Khaled?

426
00:54:07,300 --> 00:54:08,892
Are you jealous?
No.

427
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:16,576
I'd rather die than live your life.

428
00:54:16,980 --> 00:54:19,289
You know nothing
about what I'm going through.

429
00:55:19,606 --> 00:55:23,606
<i>...An office will be opened
at the high school.</i>

430
00:55:24,700 --> 00:55:27,300
<i> And now a final reminder.</i>

431
00:55:27,301 --> 00:55:29,701
<i> In application
of Colonel Rauf's decision</i>

432
00:55:29,802 --> 00:55:32,302
<i> and in accordance with
the bill posted in the city,</i>

433
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:38,698
<i> German authorities require 
a contingent of 2,000 Jewish workers</i>

434
00:55:38,700 --> 00:55:43,655
<i>for excavation work
 and trench digging.</i>

435
00:55:43,700 --> 00:55:46,700
<i>All able bodied Jewish men
 must be presented tomorrow</i>

436
00:55:48,132 --> 00:55:49,332
Raoul!

437
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:51,700
<i>to the 08:00 of the morning</i>

438
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:54,653
<i>in the Jewish workers recruitment center</i>

439
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:57,056
<i> with shovels and a picks.</i>

440
00:55:57,260 --> 00:56:01,094
<i>No Jewish inhabitant is</i>

441
00:56:01,300 --> 00:56:03,097
<i>exempt of that obligation. ..</i>

442
00:56:24,064 --> 00:56:25,807
Shalom Hajaj.

443
00:56:29,660 --> 00:56:31,935
-Age?
-Thirty years.

444
00:56:32,340 --> 00:56:35,093
-Profession?
-Locksmith.

445
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:38,497
-Any health problems?
-I cough a lot.

446
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:40,292
Come hear.

447
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:43,219
Cough!

448
00:56:44,220 --> 00:56:45,220
Again

449
00:56:46,077 --> 00:56:47,321
That way.

450
00:56:52,287 --> 00:56:54,213
Felix Haddad!

451
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:59,500
-Age?
-Fifty.

452
00:57:00,740 --> 00:57:03,174
-Profession?
-Doctor.

453
00:57:04,600 --> 00:57:07,692
I know you.  You're a carpenter.
Not a doctor.

454
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:10,332
You damn traitor!

455
00:57:20,042 --> 00:57:24,017
-Traitor!
- You're not a man!

456
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:51,053
If I'd been in their shoes,
I'd have spat in your face too.

457
00:57:52,460 --> 00:57:54,769
I wasn't my  decision
to send only the poor.

458
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,618
You're an accomplice.

459
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:02,856
Who's decision was it?

460
00:58:04,436 --> 00:58:07,000
The community leaders.  

461
00:58:07,003 --> 00:58:10,218
 We had orders to protect the elite.

462
00:58:12,838 --> 00:58:14,652
That's horrible.

463
00:58:16,160 --> 00:58:17,978
What can I do?

464
00:58:25,040 --> 00:58:26,898
Resign.

465
00:58:26,900 --> 00:58:29,734
If I do, I'll be sent away too.

466
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,370
They'll need doctors there.

467
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,577
You really want that?

468
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,894
I don't want my fiance
to be called a coward.

469
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:56,169
Know why I chose you
at the synagogue?

470
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,934
No.

471
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:01,692
For what you did at school.

472
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:05,093
I  wanted to help you.

473
01:00:28,161 --> 01:00:29,409
Where's this bra from?

474
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,652
It's new.

475
01:00:32,190 --> 01:00:35,314
Where did you get the money for it?

476
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:37,415
It was a present.

477
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:39,219
Who from?

478
01:00:39,220 --> 01:00:40,220
Why do you want to know?

479
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:43,209
You mustn't wear
another girl's clothes!

480
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:44,648
We're not beggars.

481
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:47,328
-Who gave it to you?
-A woman.

482
01:00:47,540 --> 01:00:49,212
A woman? Who?

483
01:00:52,660 --> 01:00:54,013
Myriam?

484
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:55,937
Take it off!

485
01:00:55,939 --> 01:00:57,938
-Why?
Take it off!

486
01:00:58,100 --> 01:01:01,010
You don't need to dress
like a whore to please me!

487
01:01:01,011 --> 01:01:02,957
Take it off!

488
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:35,730
You mustn't see Myriam again.

489
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:38,993
Yes.

490
01:01:39,177 --> 01:01:40,894
All right.

491
01:01:45,060 --> 01:01:49,099
<i>The bride 
has blackened her eyelashes</i>

492
01:01:50,020 --> 01:01:55,890
<i>And made up her lips.
She has been to the hammam</i>

493
01:01:56,100 --> 01:02:02,016
<i>And hennaed her hair.
she has on her most beautiful dress</i>

494
01:02:02,220 --> 01:02:05,132
<i>and all her bracelets</i>

495
01:02:05,340 --> 01:02:08,696
<i>but she is still missing something</i>

496
01:02:09,100 --> 01:02:10,215
<i>What is it?</i>

497
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:12,376
<i> Her ring.
-No.</i>

498
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:39,093
Give me a son.

499
01:02:45,700 --> 01:02:47,898
I want a son when I get back...

500
01:03:11,790 --> 01:03:13,219
Here.

501
01:03:14,050 --> 01:03:15,932
Get dressed.

502
01:03:30,040 --> 01:03:32,376
We'll talk about it when I get back.

503
01:03:34,370 --> 01:03:36,053
Thank you.

504
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:42,336
Have you packed  my things?

505
01:03:55,260 --> 01:03:57,172
I've put in some food too.

506
01:03:57,110 --> 01:03:58,673
Thank you.

507
01:04:03,350 --> 01:04:04,960
I should go.

508
01:04:06,730 --> 01:04:09,091
Your father's waiting outside.

509
01:04:10,000 --> 01:04:11,699
I know.

510
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:30,799
-Raoul!

511
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,354
Yes?

512
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:34,133
Don't go.

513
01:04:35,190 --> 01:04:37,178
It's too late now.

514
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:47,228
Don't worry, Oum Khaled.
My daughter is in good health.

515
01:06:47,980 --> 01:06:50,376
She looks a bit skinny to me.

516
01:06:50,660 --> 01:06:52,550
Here's your's money.

517
01:06:52,552 --> 01:06:57,373
Better late than never.

518
01:06:59,020 --> 01:07:00,670
Go on in.

519
01:07:19,770 --> 01:07:21,999
Inspection!  No one leaves!

520
01:07:22,100 --> 01:07:24,809
Men aren't allowed in here now!

521
01:07:25,180 --> 01:07:26,435
Stay here!

522
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:29,274
-She has no veil.

523
01:07:29,275 --> 01:07:31,275
-They respect nothing.

524
01:07:36,320 --> 01:07:37,249
-Catch them!

525
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:39,770
-They're hiding in the steam bath!

526
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:12,098
She's my sister.  A Moslem.

527
01:08:12,300 --> 01:08:14,177
-What's to prove you're Moslem?
-Here's her veil.

528
01:08:19,860 --> 01:08:23,773
<i>"There is no God but allah
and Mahomed is his prophet."</i>

529
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,897
<i>"There is no God but Allah"</i>

530
01:08:26,300 --> 01:08:27,938
<i>"and Mahomed is his prophet."</i>

531
01:08:31,140 --> 01:08:33,814
All right!
We're taking ten hostages.

532
01:08:49,230 --> 01:08:51,491
What came over you at the hammam?

533
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:53,514
Nothing.

534
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:56,215
Answer me!

535
01:08:58,080 --> 01:09:00,478
You'd let someone
 be mistreated like that?

536
01:09:00,500 --> 01:09:03,579
No, never.

537
01:09:03,360 --> 01:09:05,537
She's not someone, she's a Jew.

538
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,056
Khaled,

539
01:09:08,335 --> 01:09:10,357
Don't talk like that.

540
01:09:10,660 --> 01:09:13,057
I don't recognize you.

541
01:09:37,450 --> 01:09:39,173
Come here.

542
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:53,114
I'd like to live
in a beautiful house.

543
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:55,698
Me too.

544
01:09:57,200 --> 01:10:01,295
I'd like our son
to go to university.

545
01:10:03,380 --> 01:10:05,458
Me too.

546
01:10:11,800 --> 01:10:15,650
Ever wondered why the Jews
were allowed to do that?

547
01:10:16,530 --> 01:10:20,290
Why did the French allow them to
and not us?

548
01:10:21,080 --> 01:10:23,251
This is our country!

549
01:10:23,930 --> 01:10:25,021
Think that's normal?

550
01:10:25,022 --> 01:10:27,232
You agree with that?

551
01:10:28,680 --> 01:10:30,712
It's their country too,

552
01:10:30,713 --> 01:10:32,713
and they're poor too.

553
01:10:37,480 --> 01:10:39,219
That's not true!

554
01:10:39,340 --> 01:10:42,897
You don't know!
You've never read anything.

555
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:46,349
What do I need to read
to understand?

556
01:10:46,350 --> 01:10:47,999
It's hard to read.

557
01:10:48,000 --> 01:10:50,937
Your French isn't good enough.

558
01:10:51,250 --> 01:10:53,212
Read the Koran.

559
01:10:58,490 --> 01:11:00,392
You won't do it again?

560
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,458
You promise?

561
01:11:04,120 --> 01:11:05,320
Yes.

562
01:11:38,690 --> 01:11:40,874
Come to see me at the villa.

563
01:11:40,825 --> 01:11:43,275
I can't. It's too far.

564
01:11:43,700 --> 01:11:46,894
Come by bicycle. It's quicker.

565
01:11:46,897 --> 01:11:50,775
-You know I can't ride one.
-I'll teach you.

566
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,336
You know, I saw Khaled.

567
01:12:09,353 --> 01:12:11,372
Did you speak with him?

568
01:12:12,640 --> 01:12:13,914
No.

569
01:12:21,110 --> 01:12:23,411
Did you talk to him?

570
01:12:23,860 --> 01:12:25,899
What about?

571
01:12:26,540 --> 01:12:29,818
-About me.
-About you?

572
01:12:32,560 --> 01:12:36,579
Listen Myriam, it's politics.
You can't understand.

573
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:38,931
Explain to me then.

574
01:12:39,920 --> 01:12:41,773
Put yourself in his shoes.

575
01:12:41,830 --> 01:12:43,974
He didn't have any work

576
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:46,610
We're exploited in our own country.

577
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:50,854
The French exploit us!
and you, the Jews.

578
01:12:50,890 --> 01:12:53,212
You help them.
You take our wealth and work.

579
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:55,873
Why do you go to school
when I don't?

580
01:12:55,900 --> 01:13:00,374
Why do I wear a veil
when you don't?

581
01:13:00,060 --> 01:13:04,019
Why can you go out
without being criticized

582
01:13:04,220 --> 01:13:07,292
when I always am?

583
01:13:08,240 --> 01:13:11,260
Why can't I go out?
Why?

584
01:13:13,700 --> 01:13:15,394
Why do you say that?

585
01:13:15,395 --> 01:13:17,129
-Because it's  true.
-It is not.

586
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:19,024
Get that into your head!.

587
01:13:19,025 --> 01:13:22,896
It's not true. Raoul helps Mustapha
to rid us of the French!.

588
01:13:23,250 --> 01:13:25,331
You like your Raoul now?

589
01:13:27,280 --> 01:13:28,799
-What about Khaled?
-You still like him?

590
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:30,231
Yes, I do!

591
01:13:30,465 --> 01:13:34,337
He stepped in
to spare us any problems!.

592
01:13:39,470 --> 01:13:43,376
Besides, politics
has nothing to do with you.

593
01:13:43,398 --> 01:13:45,692
You're different.

594
01:13:51,480 --> 01:13:52,999
No, I'm not different.

595
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,374
Myriam, you're different.

596
01:13:58,300 --> 01:14:01,015
-You're different!
Let me go!

597
01:14:10,700 --> 01:14:12,119
Mum!

598
01:14:18,060 --> 01:14:19,618
What's wrong?

599
01:14:24,750 --> 01:14:26,750
What's wrong, my daughter?

600
01:14:41,070 --> 01:14:42,570
What's wrong?

601
01:16:01,730 --> 01:16:05,529
<i>If anyone desires a religion
other than Islam,</i>

602
01:16:05,530 --> 01:16:08,712
<i>never will it be accepted of him,</i>

603
01:16:09,090 --> 01:16:12,459
<i>and in the hereafter, he will be
among those who have lost.</i>

604
01:20:07,820 --> 01:20:09,617
Nour, what's wrong?

605
01:20:13,870 --> 01:20:17,057
Nothing. 
 I am looking at the well.

606
01:20:17,940 --> 01:20:19,977
<i>"Hello, here's the bride"</i>

607
01:20:20,025 --> 01:20:23,970
<i>"Hello, here's the bride"</i>

608
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:26,974
<i>"Hello, Nour, my dear"</i>

609
01:20:38,910 --> 01:20:41,176
Come on, let's go inside.

610
01:22:19,790 --> 01:22:22,056
You read Arabic now?

611
01:22:22,470 --> 01:22:23,754
No.

612
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,210
I just saw you reading.

613
01:22:27,515 --> 01:22:29,372
Who taught you?

614
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:31,997
-I learned on my own.

615
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:35,898
Impossible.  Who taught you?

616
01:22:36,550 --> 01:22:38,419
Myriam.

617
01:22:39,280 --> 01:22:41,292
Don't lie!

618
01:22:43,030 --> 01:22:45,530
And where did she learn Arabic?

619
01:22:49,590 --> 01:22:51,532
At school.

620
01:22:52,000 --> 01:22:53,659
What are you reading?

621
01:22:54,300 --> 01:22:56,332
The Koran.

622
01:22:57,620 --> 01:23:01,017
So Myriam told you
to read the Koran?

623
01:23:02,100 --> 01:23:03,479
Yes.

624
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:07,777
Go on, read it. I'm listening!

625
01:23:10,430 --> 01:23:12,538
<i>If anyone desires a religion</i>

626
01:23:13,740 --> 01:23:16,015
<i>other than Islam,</i>

627
01:23:16,020 --> 01:23:18,409
<i>never will it be accepted of him,</i>

628
01:23:18,410 --> 01:23:23,011
<i>In the hereafter, he will be
among those who have lost</i>

629
01:23:28,920 --> 01:23:31,575
So Myriam told you to read that?

630
01:23:32,020 --> 01:23:34,815
No, I found it by chance.

631
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:46,256
Read this for me!

632
01:23:59,820 --> 01:24:01,635
<i>"Those who believe,</i>

633
01:24:01,700 --> 01:24:04,736
<i>those who follow Judaism,
Christianity and the Sabians,</i>

634
01:24:03,940 --> 01:24:07,861
<i>and who believes in God,</i>

635
01:24:07,860 --> 01:24:10,396
<i>and on the Last Day
and who does good, </i>

636
01:24:10,410 --> 01:24:13,097
<i>shall have their reward
from their Lord.</i>

637
01:24:13,195 --> 01:24:16,733
<i>On them shall be no fear
nor shall they grieve.</i>

638
01:24:20,900 --> 01:24:22,573
Thank you.

639
01:24:24,990 --> 01:24:27,411
Now let me sleep.

640
01:25:43,140 --> 01:25:46,815
<i>The bride has blackened her eyelashes</i>

641
01:25:47,020 --> 01:25:52,538
<i>And made up her lips.
She has been to the hammam</i>

642
01:25:53,100 --> 01:25:58,094
<i>And hennaed her hair.
She's wearing her pretty dress</i>

643
01:25:58,300 --> 01:26:00,575
<i>and all her bracelets</i>

644
01:26:00,780 --> 01:26:05,157
<i>"But she is still missing something. 
What is it?"</i>

645
01:26:05,170 --> 01:26:09,096
-Her husband.
-Yes.

646
01:26:34,420 --> 01:26:36,092
I love you.

647
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:58,490
-Nothings happening.
-Leave them! They'll come out!

648
01:27:10,440 --> 01:27:12,616
I've read the Koran.

649
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:16,460
-On your own?
-Yes.

650
01:27:16,890 --> 01:27:19,136
But not like you said.

651
01:27:20,280 --> 01:27:22,213
What do you mean?

652
01:27:23,660 --> 01:27:26,414
I found beautiful things in it
about Myriam.

653
01:27:27,490 --> 01:27:29,970
I told you to stop seeing her!.

654
01:27:32,100 --> 01:27:34,217
I can't...

655
01:27:34,500 --> 01:27:36,577
She's my best friend.

656
01:27:56,450 --> 01:27:58,532
I'm the one who decides

657
01:28:43,140 --> 01:28:44,892
Give me your foot.

658
01:29:18,590 --> 01:29:20,139
Thank you.

659
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:34,171
Let's hear it for them!

660
01:31:54,680 --> 01:31:56,911
In name of God, 
the Lenient, the Merciful one. 

661
01:31:56,912 --> 01:31:58,612
Say: God is one.

662
01:32:00,790 --> 01:32:02,675
Hark, Israel.

663
01:32:03,200 --> 01:32:06,576
The Lord is our God.
The Lord is One.

664
01:32:06,577 --> 01:32:07,577
<i> Subtitles by j0seph</i>

665
01:34:03,376 --> 01:34:08,376
The Lord is our God.
The Lord is One.
