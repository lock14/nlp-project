1
00:02:32,812 --> 00:02:36,870
DEAD SNOW

2
00:03:07,036 --> 00:03:10,002
Hey... Hey...
Listen to this.

3
00:03:11,068 --> 00:03:13,913
It says that a man was
skiing in the mountain wilds.

4
00:03:14,615 --> 00:03:17,539
It actually says "mountain wilds".

5
00:03:17,941 --> 00:03:21,788
In the middle of two mountain tops,
he starts yelling for his dog.

6
00:03:22,306 --> 00:03:24,991
- Avalanche!
- Not very clever...

7
00:03:25,092 --> 00:03:29,466
When he was found two days later he
had dug himself six meters... Downwards.

8
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:30,662
What?

9
00:03:30,962 --> 00:03:32,427
That's pretty normal actually,

10
00:03:32,462 --> 00:03:36,008
because if you're taken by
an avalanche you get so...

11
00:03:36,009 --> 00:03:39,093
disoriented that you
won't know which way is up.

12
00:03:39,094 --> 00:03:41,548
So many start to dig the wrong way.

13
00:03:41,549 --> 00:03:44,933
- I would easily find the right way.
- You should just spit!

14
00:03:46,235 --> 00:03:49,194
- Haven't you been in the military?
- No, why?

15
00:03:49,194 --> 00:03:51,450
If you're stuck under the
snow after an avalanche,

16
00:03:51,451 --> 00:03:55,347
- you should spit to find out which way to dig.
- Just lie there and slobber on yourself?

17
00:03:55,609 --> 00:03:58,849
- Slobber?
- It means drooling.

18
00:03:58,850 --> 00:04:00,806
- Dribble.
- Dribble.

19
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:02,186
You owe me a coke.

20
00:04:02,187 --> 00:04:07,515
The spit will run downwards, so you
just dig the opposite way.

21
00:04:08,016 --> 00:04:12,000
- Gravity, as easy as that.
- Can you remember stuff from the military?

22
00:04:12,001 --> 00:04:13,872
I can only remember my duty number...

23
00:04:14,573 --> 00:04:16,783
69...

24
00:04:17,577 --> 00:04:21,153
- Speaking of 69 Martin...
- No thanks. Not interested.

25
00:04:21,154 --> 00:04:23,579
Oh, darn it.

26
00:04:24,211 --> 00:04:27,028
- Of course I mean with Hanna's cousin.
- Kris?

27
00:04:27,028 --> 00:04:29,800
- Yeah, is she single?
- She is very single.

28
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:33,302
I don't know her, but
Hanna says she is...

29
00:04:34,658 --> 00:04:36,240
...Very single.

30
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,865
Do you think there's any chance
to slam it in her number two?

31
00:04:39,867 --> 00:04:41,509
If you spit first.

32
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:50,043
- Where do you think Sara is now?
- I don't know...

33
00:04:50,043 --> 00:04:52,843
She'll probably be there
tonight or tomorrow.

34
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:57,189
I don't understand why she bothers
taking the trip over those mountains.

35
00:04:59,356 --> 00:05:02,471
So, tell me about the
boys that are coming.

36
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:06,471
Ok. Martin, which is
the best looking one...

37
00:05:06,471 --> 00:05:10,401
- Is mine.
- How did it turn out with him?

38
00:05:10,403 --> 00:05:14,766
- Will he finish the studies?
- I'm not sure. Don't think he is either.

39
00:05:14,768 --> 00:05:17,646
It's not exactly good to be a medical
student and be afraid of blood.

40
00:05:17,648 --> 00:05:20,481
- Poor Martin.
- Martin is scared of blood,

41
00:05:20,483 --> 00:05:22,028
and wants to be a doctor?

42
00:05:22,528 --> 00:05:24,252
- Seriously?
- Yes.

43
00:05:25,444 --> 00:05:29,457
Then there's Vegard, who's with Sara.

44
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:33,959
- And then there's Erlend.
- The worlds biggest movie geek.

45
00:05:33,968 --> 00:05:35,072
And Roy...

46
00:05:35,774 --> 00:05:38,774
...the horniest boy
north of the polar circle.

47
00:05:40,244 --> 00:05:43,783
- He's single, you can have him.
- Thanks... Nice.

48
00:05:55,598 --> 00:05:57,863
How does it feel to
be on the losing team?

49
00:06:00,113 --> 00:06:04,351
That overtaking earlier...

50
00:06:21,358 --> 00:06:22,769
Ok...

51
00:06:22,769 --> 00:06:27,069
Just follow the scooter trail.
It will only take 45 minutes.

52
00:06:28,396 --> 00:06:32,738
When you arrive, I will have unpacked
most of the luggage and heated the cabin.

53
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:36,882
- Is there cell phone reception there?
- No, we lost that half an hour ago.

54
00:06:36,884 --> 00:06:39,884
Then how am I supposed to make
heavy-breathing phone calls?

55
00:06:40,586 --> 00:06:42,404
The emergency number.

56
00:06:45,403 --> 00:06:46,985
Take care.

57
00:06:51,375 --> 00:06:55,975
Mile after mile, after mile!

58
00:07:25,610 --> 00:07:27,437
Hold on a second...

59
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:29,591
I have a question.

60
00:07:29,593 --> 00:07:31,893
How many movies begin
with a group of friends

61
00:07:31,894 --> 00:07:36,492
going on a trip without cell phone reception?
- Friday the 13th.

62
00:07:36,492 --> 00:07:39,634
They don't have reception, because
they don't have cell phones.

63
00:07:39,634 --> 00:07:40,949
Evil Dead 1 and 2.

64
00:07:40,951 --> 00:07:43,949
Yes, sort of... Except
that also counts the sequel

65
00:07:43,951 --> 00:07:48,701
as a remake with higher budget.
- Ok, Ok...New rule.

66
00:07:48,702 --> 00:07:52,762
- No movie talk for an hour.
- Good suggestion.

67
00:07:54,634 --> 00:07:56,066
It's for your own good Erlend.

68
00:07:56,067 --> 00:08:00,266
If you want to dip your balls this weekend,
you should stop the nerd alert.

69
00:08:02,204 --> 00:08:06,918
And then you have April Fool's
Day from... 1984 I think.

70
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:09,297
Now that's a classic.

71
00:08:10,252 --> 00:08:13,682
- Don't you agree?
- Yes.

72
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:17,293
Let's go.

73
00:10:10,365 --> 00:10:14,796
- Damn, I'm so warm now.
- It's beautiful here.

74
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:21,633
- So, what should we do?
- Watch a movie?

75
00:10:21,634 --> 00:10:26,066
- We unpack and get acquainted.
- I have a better idea...

76
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:02,924
Left foot on green.

77
00:12:04,947 --> 00:12:07,405
...Already is.

78
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:09,770
Why do we even play this game?

79
00:12:09,772 --> 00:12:14,086
Because Hollywood told
us it is great fun.

80
00:12:14,086 --> 00:12:18,701
- Right foot on red.
- It has to be the most boring game...

81
00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:21,149
That... ever...

82
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,938
- No joking?
- Of course.

83
00:12:33,902 --> 00:12:35,350
One more time?

84
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:38,850
Lie down and let me show you
sedation from the Middle Ages.

85
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,389
- What are you doing?
- Like that. Put your arms behind... There.

86
00:12:42,389 --> 00:12:45,032
- You're sitting on my hands.
- It's how it works.

87
00:12:45,067 --> 00:12:47,405
- Now close your eyes.
- No.

88
00:12:47,407 --> 00:12:49,365
- Close your eyes.
- No, I'm not closing them.

89
00:12:51,275 --> 00:12:53,649
Don't... Martin, Stop.
Quit it...

90
00:12:53,993 --> 00:12:56,648
Just relax.

91
00:13:03,913 --> 00:13:06,769
- Martin!
- Cut it out!

92
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:12,975
I was only kidding.

93
00:13:12,976 --> 00:13:17,277
Why do you do that? I get
claustrophobic and I can't breathe.

94
00:13:19,392 --> 00:13:22,311
- Sorry. Look now.
- No.

95
00:14:01,129 --> 00:14:04,394
- How does that work?
- Get some beer.

96
00:14:04,428 --> 00:14:06,187
- What?
- Beer. Beer, beer.

97
00:14:06,187 --> 00:14:07,734
Beer, beer, beer.

98
00:14:40,014 --> 00:14:42,111
Hello?

99
00:14:55,876 --> 00:14:58,246
Hello?

100
00:15:35,178 --> 00:15:37,407
There's someone out there.

101
00:15:38,158 --> 00:15:40,302
I saw someone.

102
00:15:40,303 --> 00:15:42,004
It's probably Sara.

103
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:45,467
- Not Sara...
- Are you sure it wasn't an elk?

104
00:15:45,469 --> 00:15:48,547
I can damn well tell the difference
between a human and an elk!

105
00:15:54,168 --> 00:15:55,966
I don't see anything.

106
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:03,576
There's nothing here. Vegard was right,
it was probably just an animal.

107
00:16:03,576 --> 00:16:07,291
Typical women. They get
frightened by everything.

108
00:16:17,993 --> 00:16:20,629
Is it possible to get
a cup of coffee here?

109
00:16:48,721 --> 00:16:50,450
Who made the coffee?

110
00:16:55,022 --> 00:16:57,049
Ecological...

111
00:16:59,245 --> 00:17:02,274
- Didn't it taste good?
- No, it didn't.

112
00:17:22,344 --> 00:17:25,294
What are you nice kids
doing at a place like this?

113
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:27,336
Easter vacation.

114
00:17:27,953 --> 00:17:31,599
- Is it your cabin?
- No, my girlfriend's.

115
00:17:33,546 --> 00:17:37,458
And who's the lucky one?

116
00:17:37,459 --> 00:17:38,323
She's not here right now

117
00:17:38,357 --> 00:17:41,396
- she's skiing across Istind.
- Across Istind?

118
00:17:41,397 --> 00:17:44,660
She's a bit more athletic
than the rest of us.

119
00:17:48,382 --> 00:17:50,141
Is the...

120
00:17:50,942 --> 00:17:52,740
Is the terrain dangerous?

121
00:17:52,741 --> 00:17:57,229
The terrain is the least of your
problems up there, put it that way.

122
00:18:03,159 --> 00:18:07,810
I presume you spoiled little shit-heads didn't
bother to check out the local history

123
00:18:07,811 --> 00:18:12,320
before you came waltzing in on that
bloody snow tractor of yours.

124
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:15,479
Things have happened here...

125
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,380
Things that people
don't like to talk about.

126
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:24,185
During World War II, Řksfjord was an
important location for the Germans. It was...

127
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:27,667
Almost like a middle station
for German destroyers.

128
00:18:27,669 --> 00:18:32,961
It was an important link to stop
convoys between Britain and Russia.

129
00:18:35,703 --> 00:18:37,856
"Einsatz"

130
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:44,661
That was the name of the forces
that were stationed there.

131
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:48,564
In contrast to most places where...

132
00:18:49,664 --> 00:18:53,490
the Germans got along with the civilians,
but that was not the case here.

133
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,290
It was under the leadership of...

134
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:59,808
Colonel Herzog.

135
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,579
So the civilians went through hell.

136
00:19:04,573 --> 00:19:08,115
The people were tortured, beaten
and maltreated every day.

137
00:19:09,167 --> 00:19:11,300
Trust me when I tell you...

138
00:19:12,490 --> 00:19:15,968
These were evil hellish bastards.

139
00:19:21,759 --> 00:19:25,834
It was towards the end of the war
when they stepped over the line.

140
00:19:27,295 --> 00:19:31,432
The Germans started to realize they were
beaten, and the Russians were on their way.

141
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:35,481
So the Germans went into
every house and stole all

142
00:19:35,482 --> 00:19:38,951
gold, silver and shiny
items they could find.

143
00:19:39,974 --> 00:19:42,604
Those who protested...

144
00:19:42,605 --> 00:19:45,305
got a bullet between their eyes.

145
00:19:45,423 --> 00:19:50,873
But they got one hell
of a surprise afterwards.

146
00:19:56,118 --> 00:19:59,532
The citizens had secretly teamed up.

147
00:19:59,944 --> 00:20:02,409
And decided that enough was enough.

148
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:05,445
All the anger and rage the
3,000 citizens had built up

149
00:20:05,446 --> 00:20:08,903
during the last three years
needed to be unleashed.

150
00:20:08,903 --> 00:20:11,973
So they had started gathering
all the weapons they could find.

151
00:20:11,974 --> 00:20:16,429
That was basically scythes,
axes, knives, shovels...

152
00:20:19,578 --> 00:20:22,163
Everything that could break a skull.

153
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:31,887
So...

154
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:35,588
they ambushed the bastards
in the middle of the night.

155
00:20:36,849 --> 00:20:41,334
The soldiers didn't have a chance,
and they knew it. Several got killed.

156
00:20:46,192 --> 00:20:49,072
But the devil himself...

157
00:20:50,191 --> 00:20:54,325
Colonel Herzog with several
of his men managed to escape.

158
00:20:54,425 --> 00:20:56,384
They ran up in the mountains.

159
00:20:56,385 --> 00:21:00,160
And took with them lots of the stolen goods,
the greedy pigs that they were.

160
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:08,605
Several civilians followed them, but
they lost the tracks up in the mountains.

161
00:21:10,281 --> 00:21:12,464
In these exact mountains...

162
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,763
Where they most likely froze to death.

163
00:21:19,647 --> 00:21:21,416
Because of that...

164
00:21:21,917 --> 00:21:25,018
people tread lightly up here.

165
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,438
There's an evil presence here.

166
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,324
An evil you wouldn't want to wake.

167
00:21:37,325 --> 00:21:40,963
Yeah, we have to be careful
so we don't wake up the evil.

168
00:21:55,016 --> 00:21:57,034
I should get moving.

169
00:22:06,711 --> 00:22:07,674
Remember what I told you.

170
00:22:07,675 --> 00:22:11,973
We're actually all medical students,
so I think we'll do fine.

171
00:22:11,974 --> 00:22:16,291
Unfortunately we haven't learnt to banish
evil yet, but I think that's on next semester.

172
00:22:18,108 --> 00:22:22,585
But what if you're holding your own
intestines in your hands. What do you do then?

173
00:22:22,586 --> 00:22:26,590
Or if you get your arms and legs torn off.
What do you do then?

174
00:22:28,459 --> 00:22:31,226
Have you learned that yet?

175
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,207
Thanks for the coffee.

176
00:23:21,836 --> 00:23:23,133
Sara?

177
00:23:38,630 --> 00:23:40,150
Sara?

178
00:23:41,651 --> 00:23:43,550
Sara...

179
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:13,358
Sara?

180
00:24:17,686 --> 00:24:19,653
Sara?

181
00:25:10,023 --> 00:25:12,195
Hello?

182
00:25:14,508 --> 00:25:17,388
Is there anybody there?

183
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:20,892
Hello?

184
00:25:34,771 --> 00:25:37,901
I have a weapon.

185
00:27:26,435 --> 00:27:28,986
Are you sure we shouldn't
wait till tomorrow?

186
00:27:28,987 --> 00:27:31,185
She'll probably be here during the day.

187
00:27:31,186 --> 00:27:33,061
It's no problem.

188
00:27:33,063 --> 00:27:35,863
You're probably right...

189
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:38,064
I just have a bad feeling.

190
00:27:38,563 --> 00:27:39,980
She'll probably be here soon.

191
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,480
Listen...

192
00:27:41,481 --> 00:27:43,382
If I'm not back tomorrow...

193
00:27:43,711 --> 00:27:44,807
Just listen!

194
00:27:44,909 --> 00:27:47,209
If I'm not back tomorrow...

195
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:49,309
Follow the scooter trails
back down to the car...

196
00:27:49,310 --> 00:27:51,711
And get help, ok?

197
00:27:52,015 --> 00:27:54,520
- Ok.
- Ok.

198
00:27:58,038 --> 00:28:00,690
I'll go find her.

199
00:28:03,162 --> 00:28:07,419
- See you later.
- Drive carefully.

200
00:28:19,451 --> 00:28:22,387
Ok boys, we want a clean race.

201
00:28:22,388 --> 00:28:25,509
You'll start at my signal,
and no dirty tricks.

202
00:28:25,545 --> 00:28:28,631
- Please, just one dirty trick.
- Not even one.

203
00:28:28,632 --> 00:28:31,029
Are the drivers ready?

204
00:28:34,718 --> 00:28:37,766
On your marks... Get set... Go!

205
00:29:29,652 --> 00:29:32,147
Erlend!

206
00:30:28,523 --> 00:30:30,741
Hello?

207
00:30:44,432 --> 00:30:46,664
Hello?

208
00:30:48,786 --> 00:30:50,329
Hello?

209
00:30:53,288 --> 00:30:55,894
Hi.

210
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:29,354
Ah, fuck!

211
00:31:37,965 --> 00:31:41,461
Calling Doctor Hovden...
Dr. Hovden to the emergency room.

212
00:31:42,797 --> 00:31:46,260
I see you're not exactly rid
of that little problem of yours.

213
00:31:46,261 --> 00:31:48,862
I assume there's not much
action when Aunt Flow visits.

214
00:31:49,219 --> 00:31:50,790
God damn, you're so childish.

215
00:31:50,791 --> 00:31:53,791
How the hell are you going to manage?
Six years of medical studies

216
00:31:53,826 --> 00:31:56,417
and you still almost vomit from a tiny cut.

217
00:31:56,419 --> 00:31:58,429
You can be a baker perhaps?

218
00:31:59,788 --> 00:32:02,476
- Does anyone want a beer?
- Are you ok?

219
00:32:02,477 --> 00:32:04,506
- Yeah...
- Sorry.

220
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,057
Cunt bag!

221
00:32:33,364 --> 00:32:35,715
Check this out.

222
00:32:51,894 --> 00:32:54,768
It says 1942.

223
00:32:55,544 --> 00:32:58,025
- 1942?
- Hey, hey, it's mine.

224
00:32:58,026 --> 00:33:01,602
Let's wait till Sara and Vegard return.
We won't touch it before then.

225
00:33:16,567 --> 00:33:20,038
SARA!

226
00:33:47,453 --> 00:33:49,390
Sara!

227
00:34:09,733 --> 00:34:16,007
We are two small pretty ladies.

228
00:34:18,751 --> 00:34:21,452
Hey, hey. Let's not get crazy here.

229
00:34:21,956 --> 00:34:26,922
- We don't know who it belongs to.
- That box has been here for 50 years.

230
00:34:26,923 --> 00:34:31,847
We just take what we want, cash in,
and pay down our student loans.

231
00:34:31,847 --> 00:34:35,574
It hasn't been there for 50 years,
without anyone noticing it.

232
00:34:35,574 --> 00:34:38,336
50 years? It's 100, I promise you that.

233
00:34:38,338 --> 00:34:42,646
- People have seen it, and it's just flemflams.
- Huh? Fle...?

234
00:34:42,646 --> 00:34:46,264
Flemsflams? Flemsflams? Flemsflams!

235
00:34:49,507 --> 00:34:52,137
- No, I'm going to take a shit.
- Godspeed.

236
00:34:52,137 --> 00:34:55,028
Good luck. Name him after me.

237
00:35:22,096 --> 00:35:25,780
Ok. A joke...

238
00:35:26,442 --> 00:35:29,521
This one is good. It contains
both poo, pee and sperm.

239
00:35:29,521 --> 00:35:31,277
Once upon a time there was a poo...

240
00:35:31,293 --> 00:35:39,159
There are no good jokes that don't
contain poo, pee or sperm.

241
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,018
Kris?

242
00:36:06,119 --> 00:36:07,778
No, don't...

243
00:37:01,467 --> 00:37:04,557
- And you think that is a joke?
- It's a good joke.

244
00:37:13,909 --> 00:37:15,726
You took a long time.

245
00:37:16,927 --> 00:37:18,327
Did you see Kris?

246
00:37:25,635 --> 00:37:27,427
Yes.

247
00:37:38,461 --> 00:37:40,382
Fuck.

248
00:37:44,706 --> 00:37:46,208
Erlend?

249
00:37:49,175 --> 00:37:50,869
Erlend?

250
00:37:50,869 --> 00:37:53,382
Err... Erlend, is that you?

251
00:37:54,789 --> 00:37:56,614
Oh shit.

252
00:37:57,833 --> 00:37:59,692
Erlend, stop that shit.

253
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:07,079
Erlend?

254
00:38:45,862 --> 00:38:48,284
Help... Help!

255
00:38:55,844 --> 00:38:58,405
Help! Help!

256
00:39:09,166 --> 00:39:11,581
- What the hell? It's in the middle of the song.
- Shut up!

257
00:39:11,856 --> 00:39:14,206
I thought I heard something.

258
00:39:25,842 --> 00:39:27,893
Kris?

259
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:32,824
Kris!

260
00:39:36,873 --> 00:39:38,864
Kris!

261
00:39:46,367 --> 00:39:50,603
She's not answering. I've yelled
several times, she doesn't reply.

262
00:39:50,603 --> 00:39:52,041
She's probably fucking with you.

263
00:39:52,043 --> 00:39:54,422
Don't talk to me like
I'm five years old, Martin.

264
00:39:56,902 --> 00:40:00,599
Hanna. She's wasted,
she probably fell asleep in the john.

265
00:40:02,278 --> 00:40:04,697
I'll go look for her, ok?

266
00:40:11,929 --> 00:40:14,809
Clever, we'll shoot her.

267
00:40:15,771 --> 00:40:17,409
Take it with you.

268
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:21,869
It's that maniac from earlier.

269
00:40:25,753 --> 00:40:28,322
We'll go look for her, ok?

270
00:40:33,802 --> 00:40:37,818
Someone checks the outhouse, and
someone checks around the cabin...

271
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:39,320
Shotgun!

272
00:40:44,646 --> 00:40:47,302
Martin, can't I try it? Let me hold it.

273
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,753
- No.
- Yes, come on.

274
00:40:48,755 --> 00:40:50,581
- Not now.
- Come on, just let me hold it.

275
00:40:50,583 --> 00:40:52,197
No...

276
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:54,581
- Is it heavy?
- A little.

277
00:40:54,581 --> 00:40:56,581
- Let me check it out.
- Later perhaps.

278
00:41:06,713 --> 00:41:08,648
Can you see anything?

279
00:41:11,661 --> 00:41:15,842
- I have a shotgun here. I have a shotgun!
- Sorry, sorry.

280
00:41:15,842 --> 00:41:17,242
Martin?

281
00:41:18,541 --> 00:41:20,253
Check this.

282
00:41:26,985 --> 00:41:29,971
What a nice trip... Fantastic...

283
00:41:30,195 --> 00:41:32,074
Kris? Are you taking a shit?

284
00:41:33,211 --> 00:41:35,550
Have you dozed off?

285
00:41:46,456 --> 00:41:48,521
- She wasn't there.
- Stop it.

286
00:41:48,523 --> 00:41:49,722
She wasn't there.

287
00:41:49,724 --> 00:41:50,710
What does that mean?

288
00:41:50,711 --> 00:41:53,612
She wasn't at the outhouse
or around the cabin.

289
00:41:53,614 --> 00:41:55,768
We found this though.

290
00:41:56,327 --> 00:41:59,717
- Let's see. Maybe she's inside it.
- Stop fucking around.

291
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:03,088
- It's Sara's.
- Sara's?

292
00:42:04,092 --> 00:42:07,507
- Where did you find it?
- Just behind the cabin.

293
00:42:10,175 --> 00:42:11,882
I get a bad feeling from this.

294
00:42:11,882 --> 00:42:14,952
We have to go find her,
she could freeze to death.

295
00:42:14,952 --> 00:42:21,277
- Ok, we get dressed and go look for her.
- So we'll just trudge around in the forest?

296
00:42:23,938 --> 00:42:27,045
Where did we just come from Martin?
We've just been outside.

297
00:42:31,911 --> 00:42:33,896
Oh, thank God.

298
00:42:55,753 --> 00:42:57,521
I can't see anything.

299
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,237
Pull!

300
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:07,943
Pull!

301
00:43:14,309 --> 00:43:17,090
Fuck! Move the sofa
in front of the door.

302
00:43:17,092 --> 00:43:18,980
And stay away from the windows!

303
00:43:21,791 --> 00:43:23,713
Get it out!

304
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:26,260
Come on and twist.

305
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:29,311
Leave the cushions!

306
00:44:06,179 --> 00:44:07,625
Stay calm!

307
00:44:08,126 --> 00:44:09,726
They can't get in here.

308
00:44:11,914 --> 00:44:13,311
The table!

309
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:39,309
Martin! Martin!

310
00:44:44,385 --> 00:44:46,282
Einsatz...

311
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:48,715
Zomb... Zombies...

312
00:44:52,175 --> 00:44:55,000
Don't get bitten! Don't get bitten, ok?!

313
00:44:55,001 --> 00:44:57,170
Stop that rubbish,
what the hell are we going to do?

314
00:44:57,172 --> 00:44:58,358
We have to get to the car.

315
00:45:16,289 --> 00:45:18,293
Help me!

316
00:45:43,052 --> 00:45:45,806
I said we should have
gone to a Sunny Beach!

317
00:47:07,445 --> 00:47:09,717
Martin...

318
00:47:09,967 --> 00:47:12,690
Martin, don't bite.

319
00:47:14,182 --> 00:47:16,675
Now it's suddenly totally quiet.

320
00:47:17,737 --> 00:47:21,201
Stay here and become
lunch for the rest of...

321
00:47:24,648 --> 00:47:26,626
- We have to do something.
- Like what?

322
00:47:26,628 --> 00:47:28,427
We can't just sit here.

323
00:47:29,217 --> 00:47:32,913
We must try to find the car.
We find the road back and get help.

324
00:47:32,914 --> 00:47:36,313
Only Vegard knows the way, and
the tracks are covered with snow.

325
00:47:38,295 --> 00:47:40,746
I know...

326
00:47:41,193 --> 00:47:43,443
We have to do something...

327
00:47:43,443 --> 00:47:46,143
We can't just sit here and wait for...

328
00:47:46,143 --> 00:47:48,784
Wait for it to fix itself,
we have to do something.

329
00:47:56,038 --> 00:47:57,771
What if we split up?

330
00:47:57,771 --> 00:48:01,072
Two can look for the car, while
two waits here for Vegard.

331
00:48:02,981 --> 00:48:07,278
Those who eventually leave will most
likely get those bloody bastards after them.

332
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:14,461
If two go outside and make a noise,
it will attract... Those creatures.

333
00:48:14,534 --> 00:48:17,347
At the same time the two
others run into the woods.

334
00:48:17,349 --> 00:48:19,494
Then we'll just run towards the fjord.

335
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:22,938
There are people down by the fjord,
we will have to get help.

336
00:48:23,793 --> 00:48:27,710
Who will get to be those
lucky bastards acting as bait?

337
00:48:40,005 --> 00:48:42,081
You do something too!

338
00:48:42,911 --> 00:48:45,615
Where are you, you cowardly bastards?!

339
00:48:45,617 --> 00:48:47,998
Are you afraid to come out in daylight?!

340
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,800
Fuck, was that too much?

341
00:48:49,800 --> 00:48:52,023
Do you think they'll get pissed?

342
00:49:00,795 --> 00:49:02,349
Come on.

343
00:50:32,121 --> 00:50:34,235
Fuck...

344
00:51:23,349 --> 00:51:25,960
Sara?

345
00:51:39,914 --> 00:51:42,579
Come on!

346
00:51:43,023 --> 00:51:44,824
Cowardly bastard.

347
00:53:24,186 --> 00:53:26,123
Ok...

348
00:53:41,092 --> 00:53:43,094
Do you recognize any of this?

349
00:53:43,994 --> 00:53:45,744
Not a chance.

350
00:53:45,746 --> 00:53:48,005
Everything looks the same...

351
00:53:50,128 --> 00:53:53,666
- Which way?
- If we both go downhill...

352
00:54:02,827 --> 00:54:05,329
- We have to split up.
- What?

353
00:54:05,329 --> 00:54:09,197
One of us have to get down
to the damn car and get help.

354
00:54:09,199 --> 00:54:12,315
- We go to that car together!
- Liv, listen to me.

355
00:54:12,317 --> 00:54:15,085
We don't stand a chance on our own,
we have to go together.

356
00:54:15,086 --> 00:54:20,094
- One of us have to get to the car...
- Please, we can't! I don't want to go by myself!

357
00:54:20,094 --> 00:54:22,416
Liv, listen to me!

358
00:54:32,331 --> 00:54:35,059
You saw what happened to Erlend.

359
00:54:36,195 --> 00:54:38,903
We don't stand a chance on our own.

360
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:44,983
We have to go together...

361
00:54:50,909 --> 00:54:54,878
- We run together.
- We run together.

362
01:02:41,291 --> 01:02:43,286
Are you sure that thing will work?!

363
01:02:43,286 --> 01:02:45,887
Have you ever tasted
moonshine from Finnmark?

364
01:02:50,751 --> 01:02:52,893
Throw!

365
01:03:12,059 --> 01:03:17,177
Hi. My name is Martin Hovden, and we're
staying at a cabin in Řksfjord... And...

366
01:03:17,177 --> 01:03:22,097
Just up in the mountains. We're under
attack by something that looks like...

367
01:03:23,378 --> 01:03:25,250
German soldiers from WWII.

368
01:03:25,251 --> 01:03:27,811
And now we managed to set the
cabin on fire, and... Hello?

369
01:03:27,813 --> 01:03:29,240
Hello!

370
01:03:29,242 --> 01:03:32,128
- That fucking cunt hung up on me!
- Of course she did, what you said sounds -

371
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:34,322
- insanely absurd!
- Then what the fuck should I say?

372
01:03:34,324 --> 01:03:36,532
Say that we are under
attack by terrorists!

373
01:03:36,534 --> 01:03:39,733
Say that they have missiles. They will
bring helicopters and all that shit.

374
01:03:39,768 --> 01:03:41,099
Brilliant.

375
01:03:41,101 --> 01:03:43,961
Fucking cunt, it's out of battery!

376
01:03:44,735 --> 01:03:46,201
Come!

377
01:03:47,436 --> 01:03:52,061
- We have to get over to that shack!
- The shack? What the hell are we doing there?

378
01:03:52,639 --> 01:03:54,393
We don't have time for that now.

379
01:04:07,416 --> 01:04:10,514
- I can't see anyone.
- I'll look for some light.

380
01:04:22,936 --> 01:04:25,728
You know what we have to do, right?

381
01:04:27,128 --> 01:04:29,717
- Right?
- Yes.

382
01:09:43,402 --> 01:09:45,510
A little more.

383
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,511
Duck!

384
01:11:06,283 --> 01:11:07,927
Where have you been?

385
01:11:07,929 --> 01:11:10,429
Where the hell did
you get a machine gun?

386
01:11:13,719 --> 01:11:16,279
I've kept myself busy.

387
01:11:20,956 --> 01:11:23,012
Where are the others?

388
01:11:23,621 --> 01:11:28,731
Hanna and Liv are looking
for the car to get some help.

389
01:11:32,384 --> 01:11:34,226
The others...

390
01:11:36,530 --> 01:11:38,457
They...?

391
01:11:44,122 --> 01:11:45,551
Behind you!

392
01:14:57,171 --> 01:15:00,025
No, no, no, no, no, no...

393
01:15:01,087 --> 01:15:02,188
What is it?

394
01:15:02,189 --> 01:15:06,288
Do you remember what
Erlend said. Do you?

395
01:15:06,387 --> 01:15:10,734
Don't get bitten. No matter
what you do; Don't get bitten.

396
01:15:11,710 --> 01:15:14,750
- Then you turn into...
- Isn't your grandfather half Jewish?

397
01:15:14,751 --> 01:15:17,295
You don't think they would
recruit someone half Jewish?

398
01:15:17,296 --> 01:15:20,466
You'll get infected if you...
You'll be like them.

399
01:15:21,291 --> 01:15:25,042
You saw what they did to Vegard. It didn't
exactly look like they wanted team mates.

400
01:15:25,043 --> 01:15:27,921
Do you think I'm willing
to gamble on that?

401
01:15:36,175 --> 01:15:39,056
- What are you doing?
- We had...

402
01:15:39,057 --> 01:15:40,957
We learned about amputation, remember?

403
01:15:44,627 --> 01:15:46,997
What the fuck are you doing?

404
01:17:03,963 --> 01:17:06,225
No, no, no, no, no!

405
01:17:31,134 --> 01:17:34,188
Let's sledge that fucker
and get out of here.

406
01:19:27,228 --> 01:19:29,354
Run, for fuck's sake!

407
01:24:30,578 --> 01:24:32,835
Oh, fuck...
