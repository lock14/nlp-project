Resync: Xenzai[NEF]

2
00:00:50,502 --> 00:00:51,429
Hi.

3
00:00:52,454 --> 00:00:53,381
Hi.

4
00:00:54,213 --> 00:00:56,101
My name is Kent.
What's your name?

5
00:00:56,229 --> 00:00:57,189
Daphne.

6
00:00:57,189 --> 00:00:58,980
Daphne. Beautiful name.

7
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,028
It sounds like the
name of a flower.

8
00:01:01,028 --> 00:01:03,898
Obviously I know that it's
not a flower, but it could be.

9
00:01:05,638 --> 00:01:06,652
I like the flowers.

10
00:01:06,822 --> 00:01:09,669
Smelling them, stuff like that.
Sending them to people.

11
00:01:14,405 --> 00:01:15,386
Where are you from?

12
00:01:16,324 --> 00:01:17,285
Connecticut.

13
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:19,073
Really?
I am a big fan of it.

14
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,020
I'm a... Who isn't, right?
You're close to the city...

15
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,941
...and you can really enjoy it.

16
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:25,882
But also it has
a small town feel.

17
00:01:25,956 --> 00:01:28,804
-Did you go to school there?
-Yeah. I went to Wesslam.

18
00:01:28,804 --> 00:01:29,852
That's a great school.

19
00:01:30,565 --> 00:01:32,451
-What's your major?
-Psychology.

20
00:01:32,707 --> 00:01:33,635
It's great.

21
00:01:33,701 --> 00:01:36,484
Those are really beautiful
earrings, by the way.

22
00:01:36,484 --> 00:01:38,371
Nice job complementing...

23
00:01:38,371 --> 00:01:40,195
I'll stop you right there.

24
00:01:40,195 --> 00:01:42,308
Because on paper
you've done everything right.

25
00:01:42,308 --> 00:01:44,996
Took an interest
in my personal history.

26
00:01:44,996 --> 00:01:46,882
You've complemented
my accessories.

27
00:01:47,011 --> 00:01:48,986
Blah, blah, blah.

28
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,866
If we'd met in college, our
relationship would've developed.

29
00:01:52,866 --> 00:01:55,554
Which I'd come to regret.
I'd find out...

30
00:01:55,554 --> 00:01:57,603
...that you're just as boring
in the bedroom...

31
00:01:57,603 --> 00:02:00,385
...as you've been during
this awful conversation.

32
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:01,411
Okay, Daphne...

33
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:03,331
If I wanted a nice
sexual pen pal...

34
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,312
...you'd be on my list.

35
00:02:04,386 --> 00:02:07,964
We'd just l-chat all night.
LOL. Tickles.

36
00:02:08,227 --> 00:02:11,008
But unfortunately, that's
not what I'm looking for.

37
00:02:11,074 --> 00:02:12,983
I want a man whose
hand doesn't shake...

38
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:16,600
...when he puts it up my shirt.
Do you know what I'm saying?

39
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:18,626
Okay.
Daphne, if I could just...

40
00:02:18,626 --> 00:02:20,706
Save it, Kent.
I'm not looking for a BFF.

41
00:02:20,706 --> 00:02:22,398
Daphne, please.

42
00:02:23,491 --> 00:02:25,246
Bitch, I'm talking to you!

43
00:02:27,298 --> 00:02:29,273
-What did you call me?
-I didn't stutter.

44
00:02:30,146 --> 00:02:32,993
You sure can talk the talk,
you crazy little slut.

45
00:02:32,993 --> 00:02:34,848
But, can you
deliver the goodies?

46
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:37,752
I don't give a damn
about Connecticut.

47
00:02:37,954 --> 00:02:39,809
I hate those cheap buildings.

48
00:02:40,642 --> 00:02:43,609
I'm from North Dakota and this
is how we handle our business...

49
00:02:43,682 --> 00:02:45,470
...in the vice and state,
mamma.

50
00:02:47,392 --> 00:02:48,482
Get your hands off me.

51
00:02:48,482 --> 00:02:51,165
I'll take you to your knees
in this bar.

52
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:52,160
Promise?

53
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,487
Hold on, angel crossing!
Angel crossing!

54
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,145
Get on it. Here we come.
Watch out!

55
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,606
What a beautiful view.

56
00:03:34,368 --> 00:03:35,481
So, this is where you live?

57
00:03:38,272 --> 00:03:41,021
This is where
you live too, honey. Come on.

58
00:03:45,055 --> 00:03:46,910
What do you think
about Daphne?

59
00:03:47,902 --> 00:03:49,791
-I really liked Daphne.
-You did?

60
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,583
-Yeah.
-Definitely naughty.

61
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:53,590
She's a lot naughty,
but in the fun way.

62
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:55,488
Kent?
Did you like him?

63
00:03:55,488 --> 00:03:56,543
-Kent was hot.
-Really?

64
00:03:56,543 --> 00:03:58,430
I like those glasses,
nice touch.

65
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:00,372
You want to try
on the planes vibe?

66
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:03,092
Like an angry cowboy
who drives a van.

67
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,054
-Hot.
-But has ninja equipment...

68
00:04:05,054 --> 00:04:07,070
...back in his apartment.
A lot's happening.

69
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,094
-You know?
-Yeah.

70
00:04:08,094 --> 00:04:09,791
Like a transformer.

71
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,638
-I'd like to meet Kent again.
-Yeah, come here.

72
00:04:12,864 --> 00:04:14,521
Toothpaste and all.

73
00:04:14,846 --> 00:04:16,670
-I love you, Kate.
-I love you.

74
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:19,320
You are the best girl
in the whole world.

75
00:04:47,198 --> 00:04:48,309
Let's get this off of you.

76
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:50,108
That was fun.

77
00:04:50,237 --> 00:04:52,221
-That feels good.
-It's the acupressure.

78
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:54,108
-Really?
-No, I just like to rub it.

79
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:57,820
This stuff is connected to
stuff inside your tummy.

80
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,909
-I know.
-Push the wrong...

81
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:00,861
-Know what that's for?
-Until later.

82
00:05:00,861 --> 00:05:01,789
Okay.

83
00:05:03,451 --> 00:05:04,467
When's the big day?

84
00:05:05,469 --> 00:05:06,428
I'm sorry?

85
00:05:06,428 --> 00:05:09,340
We're getting married in the
spring in South Carolina.

86
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,090
-Yeah, what about you?
-We're not getting married.

87
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:15,132
So, why do you take
the dance classes?

88
00:05:15,132 --> 00:05:17,915
We do a lot of stuff together.
That's one.

89
00:05:17,915 --> 00:05:18,864
Yeah, it's fun.

90
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,955
Can't think of what
we don't do together.

91
00:05:20,955 --> 00:05:22,810
Why you
don't wanna get married?

92
00:05:23,675 --> 00:05:24,699
-Yeah.
-We are happy.

93
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,650
-We're happy.
-Yeah.

94
00:05:25,726 --> 00:05:27,676
I love her.
Marriage brings pressure...

95
00:05:27,676 --> 00:05:29,467
...and stress in stuff.

96
00:05:29,467 --> 00:05:31,451
Don't want our relationship
to be work.

97
00:05:31,451 --> 00:05:33,371
We're together
'cause we enjoy it.

98
00:05:33,371 --> 00:05:35,094
Not because we have to.

99
00:05:35,163 --> 00:05:37,269
There's a reason that they
use the expressions:

100
00:05:37,978 --> 00:05:39,889
"Tying the knot"
or "Ball and chain".

101
00:05:39,963 --> 00:05:41,851
Know the
words of a ceremony?

102
00:05:41,851 --> 00:05:44,698
Like: "l promise to obey."
Or "Till death do us part."

103
00:05:44,763 --> 00:05:46,672
I'd rather be like stuck
on an island...

104
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:49,530
...with some weird millionaire
trying to kill me...

105
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,642
...and trying to escape
than be...

106
00:05:50,714 --> 00:05:53,585
...in something with that.
That's a time bomb.

107
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:56,475
So, what about children?
You do want to make them, no?

108
00:05:56,475 --> 00:05:58,169
-No, no.
-No.

109
00:05:58,169 --> 00:05:59,249
I don't wanna make them.

110
00:06:02,074 --> 00:06:04,986
It just don't want to be
responsible for this kid...

111
00:06:04,986 --> 00:06:06,774
...and disappoint them.

112
00:06:06,842 --> 00:06:07,962
Yeah, that's our families.

113
00:06:07,962 --> 00:06:09,881
We're both from
divorced families.

114
00:06:09,881 --> 00:06:12,729
We've seen it. We don't
need to repeat the pattern.

115
00:06:12,729 --> 00:06:15,478
But anyway, congratulations
on getting married.

116
00:06:15,544 --> 00:06:17,455
That's a cool thing.
To each their own.

117
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,478
Yeah, absolutely.

118
00:06:19,227 --> 00:06:20,438
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas!

119
00:06:21,146 --> 00:06:21,397
Bye-bye.

120
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:47,026
-Big-bad Brad!
-Hi!

121
00:06:47,096 --> 00:06:49,113
-How are you?
-Look at this. How are you?

122
00:06:49,113 --> 00:06:50,868
You remember
my girlfriend.

123
00:06:50,936 --> 00:06:52,856
-How are you? Good to see you.
-Hi.

124
00:06:52,856 --> 00:06:54,841
What are you guys
doing for Christmas?

125
00:06:54,841 --> 00:06:57,590
We got the entire
family flying in.

126
00:06:57,688 --> 00:06:59,597
13 airport pick-ups.

127
00:06:59,672 --> 00:07:03,382
4 days of listening
to how gifted my nieces are.

128
00:07:03,576 --> 00:07:07,255
My brother thinks his daughter,
the four year old...

129
00:07:07,255 --> 00:07:09,078
...is gonna be the next Beyonce.

130
00:07:12,248 --> 00:07:14,866
She is bad and she sucks.

131
00:07:16,088 --> 00:07:18,871
I'm vacationing in tropical
Albany this year...

132
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:20,632
...with Tricia's family.

133
00:07:20,632 --> 00:07:22,584
They got us a cot,
which is awesome.

134
00:07:22,584 --> 00:07:23,599
We'll end up sleeping...

135
00:07:23,671 --> 00:07:25,655
...on the couch
in the basement with cats.

136
00:07:25,655 --> 00:07:27,350
All seven of them.

137
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,259
We'll get to be there
the whole week.

138
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,414
Sounds like
a prison sentence.

139
00:07:31,414 --> 00:07:33,270
Why put
yourselves through that?

140
00:07:33,335 --> 00:07:36,018
It's Christmas, right?
Don't you have to?

141
00:07:36,086 --> 00:07:37,176
We don't need to do it.

142
00:07:37,176 --> 00:07:39,030
We don't.
We don't do it.

143
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:40,941
-We're done.
-Why, what are you doing?

144
00:07:41,015 --> 00:07:43,568
-We're going to Fiji. Just us.
-Yeah.

145
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,532
Fiji?

146
00:07:44,598 --> 00:07:45,558
Yeah.

147
00:07:45,558 --> 00:07:46,742
Don't your families
get upset?

148
00:07:46,742 --> 00:07:48,629
Not if you're doing
charity work.

149
00:07:49,462 --> 00:07:52,212
Like building houses
in third world countries.

150
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:54,221
Teaching English
in Puerto Rico.

151
00:07:54,294 --> 00:07:56,115
Helping orphans in Somalia.

152
00:07:56,213 --> 00:07:59,028
Helping Chinese kids
capture lobsters.

153
00:08:00,053 --> 00:08:02,838
Boil them, cut them,
clean the weird stuff out.

154
00:08:02,838 --> 00:08:04,885
We find it that the more
details you give...

155
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,773
...kinda throws them
off the set.

156
00:08:06,869 --> 00:08:09,686
You lie to your families
at Christmas time?

157
00:08:09,686 --> 00:08:12,369
You really
can't do it without lies.

158
00:08:12,534 --> 00:08:13,460
Try it.

159
00:08:14,581 --> 00:08:16,435
But don't you
ever feel guilty?

160
00:08:17,173 --> 00:08:19,157
For taking a vacation
on our vacation?

161
00:08:19,157 --> 00:08:20,148
No, not really.

162
00:08:20,148 --> 00:08:22,898
-You look sexy with a tan.
-Thanks, babe.

163
00:08:23,925 --> 00:08:25,867
You could take this one.
This one here.

164
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:28,716
-Like that.
-Yeah, that's a good idea.

165
00:08:31,606 --> 00:08:33,717
I made a couple's
massage rev for the weekend.

166
00:08:33,717 --> 00:08:35,474
-You did? It's great.
-Yeah.

167
00:08:37,492 --> 00:08:39,476
I'd
check us in online after this.

168
00:08:39,476 --> 00:08:40,404
I did it.

169
00:08:40,468 --> 00:08:43,220
You checked us in?
You're the best, sweetheart.

170
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,003
I picked up a pair of
noise-canceling headphones.

171
00:08:46,068 --> 00:08:48,020
-You did not.
-For the next time.

172
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,930
-Oh my God.
-I'm excited.

173
00:08:50,037 --> 00:08:53,651
We'd sign up for the scuba
boat as soon as we get there...

174
00:08:53,651 --> 00:08:55,507
...I heard it fills up
really quick.

175
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,515
Do you feel like we've
been on this vacation before?

176
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,288
The scuba diving, we did that
in Bali and Costa Rica.

177
00:09:02,355 --> 00:09:05,290
Yeah, but this is Fiji.
We've never been to Fiji.

178
00:09:06,261 --> 00:09:09,107
That's a different island.
The resort is beautiful.

179
00:09:09,107 --> 00:09:11,856
And the scuba diving
will be different.

180
00:09:11,923 --> 00:09:13,745
It's different water and fish.

181
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:15,795
It's gonna be really good.
I'm excited.

182
00:09:15,795 --> 00:09:17,714
-lt'll be amazing.
-Are you excited?

183
00:09:17,714 --> 00:09:19,655
-I am. I'm really excited.
-I'm excited.

184
00:09:22,642 --> 00:09:24,466
-I love you.
-I love you too.

185
00:09:38,738 --> 00:09:39,849
Hey, Mom, merry Christmas.

186
00:09:40,818 --> 00:09:41,746
Yeah.

187
00:09:42,738 --> 00:09:45,552
Listen. Actually I'm sorry
I didn't call you sooner.

188
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,529
We're actually heading out
to Burma.

189
00:09:48,466 --> 00:09:51,400
Yeah. That's exactly
the island in Asia, Burma.

190
00:09:53,202 --> 00:09:54,281
We're inoculating babies.

191
00:09:55,089 --> 00:09:57,063
Yeah, we'll be
helping out this kids.

192
00:09:58,002 --> 00:10:00,081
It's such a great cause,
but honestly...

193
00:10:00,081 --> 00:10:03,665
...it just sucks that we won't
be with you and the family.

194
00:10:03,665 --> 00:10:06,664
You know how much...
I know it's been three years.

195
00:10:06,737 --> 00:10:08,624
I wish I would've
called you sooner.

196
00:10:08,689 --> 00:10:12,300
But Kate sent all
the gifts and stuff to you.

197
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:14,219
Okay.

198
00:10:17,168 --> 00:10:19,057
That's Merry Christmas
in Burmese.

199
00:10:19,186 --> 00:10:22,000
All right, I'll tell her.
I love you too. Bye.

200
00:10:22,864 --> 00:10:23,944
Learned
"Merry Christmas"?

201
00:10:24,017 --> 00:10:26,667
I gotta take everything
to the next level.

202
00:10:26,737 --> 00:10:28,677
Come on, let's do this.
I'm excited.

203
00:10:50,736 --> 00:10:52,622
Attention, San Francisco
passengers.

204
00:10:52,751 --> 00:10:54,639
All flights
have been grounded...

205
00:10:54,639 --> 00:10:56,431
...due to
weather conditions.

206
00:10:56,431 --> 00:10:57,391
Sir, excuse me.

207
00:10:57,391 --> 00:10:59,471
Your flight is not going out.

208
00:10:59,471 --> 00:11:02,351
But what I can do
is get you set up for standby...

209
00:11:02,351 --> 00:11:05,002
...on the first flight
to Fiji tomorrow. Okay?

210
00:11:05,072 --> 00:11:06,159
Tomorrow won't be great.

211
00:11:06,159 --> 00:11:08,143
We've scheduled
the couple's massage...

212
00:11:08,143 --> 00:11:10,958
I'm sorry, sir. I don't make
the fog, I deal with it.

213
00:11:11,758 --> 00:11:14,702
The best I can do is get you
a suite at the Radisson.

214
00:11:14,702 --> 00:11:17,517
They have lovely accommodations
next to the airport.

215
00:11:17,582 --> 00:11:19,535
You promise?
At the Radisson?

216
00:11:19,535 --> 00:11:21,326
-Did you hear that?
-Brad.

217
00:11:21,326 --> 00:11:22,350
No, that's terrific.

218
00:11:22,350 --> 00:11:24,260
Would it be possible
to take us out...

219
00:11:24,334 --> 00:11:26,155
...and get us McDonald's
as desert?

220
00:11:26,221 --> 00:11:28,110
I'll start missing
flights often.

221
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:30,093
With this kind of
red carpet service.

222
00:11:30,093 --> 00:11:31,917
-Terrific. A suite.
-Brad, please.

223
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:34,830
That's not helping, Brad.
Is there another airline...

224
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:37,741
...that you're affiliated with?
Like a sister airline?

225
00:11:37,741 --> 00:11:40,675
-No, I'm sorry.
-Do you have a cousin airline?

226
00:11:40,749 --> 00:11:43,531
How about one your
airline's filled out before?

227
00:11:43,597 --> 00:11:47,307
The FAA has ruled that bay
area fog is simply too thick.

228
00:11:47,373 --> 00:11:50,254
No flights are coming in
and no flights are going out...

229
00:11:50,254 --> 00:11:52,141
...until at least
tomorrow morning.

230
00:11:52,141 --> 00:11:55,084
Let's see how travelers
are coping in all of this task.

231
00:11:55,084 --> 00:11:58,697
We have a couple over here.
Excuse me, sir?

232
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,575
Where are you headed
for this Christmas?

233
00:12:03,693 --> 00:12:05,416
We're live on the air.

234
00:12:05,645 --> 00:12:07,499
You look
dressed for vacation.

235
00:12:12,268 --> 00:12:15,170
We're taking...
And we take the trips.

236
00:12:16,173 --> 00:12:18,987
We'll take a different trip.

237
00:12:18,987 --> 00:12:21,963
What he's trying to say is
that we plan a trip every year.

238
00:12:21,963 --> 00:12:24,582
This is actually
ruining our Christmas.

239
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,595
You must be pretty upset.
Are you visiting family?

240
00:12:30,637 --> 00:12:31,564
This is Kate.

241
00:12:33,388 --> 00:12:34,337
Hi, Mom.

242
00:12:36,107 --> 00:12:38,155
I know, Mom. All the flights
were cancelled.

243
00:12:38,155 --> 00:12:39,243
-They're not...
-It's Dad.

244
00:12:39,243 --> 00:12:41,899
They're not sure
if it'll be today.

245
00:12:41,899 --> 00:12:43,946
You want me to answer it?
Do I answer or no?

246
00:12:43,946 --> 00:12:45,671
Do I pick it up or not?

247
00:12:45,771 --> 00:12:47,851
Yes, I know. I understand
you have feelings.

248
00:12:47,851 --> 00:12:51,496
What? What do you want me to do?
I don't know what this means.

249
00:12:55,307 --> 00:12:57,259
He's gonna
give you a big hug.

250
00:12:57,259 --> 00:12:59,233
-I'm not hugging anybody.
-He's excited.

251
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:02,113
-We'll see you at noon.
-Noon?

252
00:13:03,082 --> 00:13:05,131
Kate, are you crazy?
Did you commit us to go?

253
00:13:05,131 --> 00:13:08,746
What did you want me to say?
They saw us on the news.

254
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,687
We're not
inoculating babies in Burma.

255
00:13:10,794 --> 00:13:11,842
-No...
-We're stuck here.

256
00:13:12,555 --> 00:13:13,737
What did you say to your dad?

257
00:13:13,737 --> 00:13:16,554
I told my dad that we'll
be going over there.

258
00:13:16,554 --> 00:13:18,377
Don't compare
your situation.

259
00:13:18,443 --> 00:13:20,264
-You kidding?
-There's new stuff...

260
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,354
...that you're missing.

261
00:13:21,354 --> 00:13:24,038
My Dad's a unique
animal. Your mother's not.

262
00:13:24,106 --> 00:13:26,251
My dad, your mom.
My mom, your dad.

263
00:13:26,251 --> 00:13:27,210
Great.

264
00:13:27,210 --> 00:13:29,796
We'll see
4 families in one day.

265
00:13:29,866 --> 00:13:31,906
Know what this means?
What you committed us to?

266
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,759
I know exactly
what this means.

267
00:13:46,378 --> 00:13:47,305
Brad.

268
00:13:50,025 --> 00:13:50,952
Baby.

269
00:13:52,073 --> 00:13:53,829
I don't want to fight.

270
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:55,913
I don't wanna fight either.

271
00:13:55,913 --> 00:13:58,664
-I hate this.
-We never fight. I'm sorry.

272
00:13:58,664 --> 00:13:59,592
I love you.

273
00:14:00,745 --> 00:14:03,497
This is what our families do
and what happens.

274
00:14:03,497 --> 00:14:05,543
Mother makes me crazy
when I talk to her.

275
00:14:05,543 --> 00:14:08,232
You're right.
Here's all we got to do.

276
00:14:08,232 --> 00:14:10,185
Get through this
Four Christmases...

277
00:14:10,185 --> 00:14:12,232
...as quickly and as painlessly
as possible.

278
00:14:12,232 --> 00:14:15,134
Exactly. Promise me that no
matter what happens today...

279
00:14:15,944 --> 00:14:17,056
...we'll still
have each other.

280
00:14:18,025 --> 00:14:20,643
-Honey, of course we will.
-Okay.

281
00:14:30,247 --> 00:14:32,221
If one of these
houses gets too intense...

282
00:14:32,295 --> 00:14:34,216
-...we'll need a strategy.
-Yes.

283
00:14:34,216 --> 00:14:37,031
We'll need a word that
means it's time to leave.

284
00:14:37,031 --> 00:14:38,920
A safe word,
what it should be?

285
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,103
It's a good idea.
Mistletoe.

286
00:14:40,103 --> 00:14:41,991
-Mistletoe is really good.
-Okay.

287
00:14:42,823 --> 00:14:46,499
By the way, my father's house
can get uncomfortable.

288
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:49,606
Please do not feel embarrassed
if you feel the need...

289
00:14:49,606 --> 00:14:51,516
...to pull the cord early,
say Mistletoe...

290
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:53,500
...if this house
gets too uncomfortable.

291
00:14:54,213 --> 00:14:56,157
-Okay.
-Even if we're there for 10 min.

292
00:14:56,231 --> 00:14:58,052
All right, I'll let you know.

293
00:14:58,215 --> 00:15:00,101
I'm looking out for you.
Be cool.

294
00:15:00,101 --> 00:15:02,918
I'm gonna go see
your dad and your brothers now.

295
00:15:02,918 --> 00:15:04,990
Unless you're too weird
with it, then we're out.

296
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:07,740
-I'm going in.
-And going out would be...

297
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:11,556
-Mistletoe.
-Done. Let's get out of here.

298
00:15:11,556 --> 00:15:14,591
Brad, we're going in.
Let's go.

299
00:15:23,941 --> 00:15:26,917
Son of a bitch.
The TV stars actually came.

300
00:15:26,917 --> 00:15:28,900
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas, Dad.

301
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,790
Merry Christmas.
Good to see you.

302
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,732
-Thanks for having us.
-Good to see you.

303
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:33,798
-Come on in.
-Okay.

304
00:15:33,798 --> 00:15:36,517
Let's... Let's celebrate.

305
00:15:36,517 --> 00:15:38,305
Okay. Sounds good.

306
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:44,229
That's a lot
of presents you sent.

307
00:15:44,229 --> 00:15:46,016
You're trying
to outdo us?

308
00:15:46,147 --> 00:15:48,003
The biggest
one is for you, Howard.

309
00:15:49,091 --> 00:15:50,789
Yeah? What is it?

310
00:15:50,789 --> 00:15:51,835
I'm not gonna tell you.

311
00:15:55,716 --> 00:15:56,698
What, are you crazy?

312
00:15:56,773 --> 00:15:57,700
-Bro.
-Hey, buddy.

313
00:16:03,267 --> 00:16:04,195
Baby!

314
00:16:06,403 --> 00:16:09,251
Kate, these are my brothers:
Denver and Dallas.

315
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,899
-Hi, nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

316
00:16:12,899 --> 00:16:14,786
You must be Orlando's girl.

317
00:16:14,979 --> 00:16:15,873
Orlando?

318
00:16:15,939 --> 00:16:18,820
We're named after the cities
in which we're conceived.

319
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:21,667
I'm Denver, that's Dallas.
And this is Orlando.

320
00:16:24,355 --> 00:16:25,316
Orlando?

321
00:16:25,316 --> 00:16:28,284
My given name is Orlando.
But I changed it to Brad.

322
00:16:29,315 --> 00:16:30,297
I'm Brad.

323
00:16:31,331 --> 00:16:32,291
What?

324
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:34,975
Well, Merry Christmas
one and all.

325
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:36,961
-Ordeurs for anyone.
-Come on.

326
00:16:37,794 --> 00:16:39,682
Who are you trying
to impress, Suze?

327
00:16:39,842 --> 00:16:41,729
We also got beer in the back.

328
00:16:41,729 --> 00:16:42,679
Ladies first.

329
00:16:43,585 --> 00:16:44,534
Thank you so much.

330
00:16:47,554 --> 00:16:49,376
What is this?
Is this cheese?

331
00:16:49,571 --> 00:16:51,294
Yeah, spray.

332
00:16:52,451 --> 00:16:56,225
Spray cheese from the famous
family of aerosol cheeses.

333
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:02,872
Give me a hand.

334
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:07,650
Here we go.

335
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,464
Do you have something
to say about my wife's cheese?

336
00:17:12,481 --> 00:17:13,538
Hump it! Hump it!

337
00:17:13,538 --> 00:17:15,425
I haven't seen
that in a while.

338
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:19,036
Shut it, soldier boy!

339
00:17:19,265 --> 00:17:21,884
The spray cheese!
The spray cheese!

340
00:17:22,081 --> 00:17:24,023
Bring it home, soldier boy.

341
00:17:38,304 --> 00:17:41,272
God, honey. I'm so sorry
that you had to see that.

342
00:17:41,345 --> 00:17:43,201
Let me
apologize for them.

343
00:17:43,201 --> 00:17:47,039
If you wanna say "Mistletoe"
'cause it's too heavy, I get it.

344
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:48,929
I get it. Don't feel weird.

345
00:17:48,929 --> 00:17:51,808
Need to get out, let me
know about your comfort zone.

346
00:17:51,808 --> 00:17:52,756
That was weird.

347
00:17:53,695 --> 00:17:55,743
Can't believe you didn't
tell me your name.

348
00:17:55,743 --> 00:17:57,466
-What are you saying?
-l...

349
00:17:58,495 --> 00:18:00,502
It's crazy.
We've been together for 3 years.

350
00:18:01,216 --> 00:18:03,263
I don't know your name.
Isn't that odd?

351
00:18:03,263 --> 00:18:05,981
No, it's not. I hated my name
so I changed it.

352
00:18:06,976 --> 00:18:09,823
Don't say: "My name used
to be asshole, but it's Bob."

353
00:18:09,887 --> 00:18:12,735
-Just: "My name is Bob."
-Maybe to a stranger...

354
00:18:12,735 --> 00:18:13,950
...but to somebody close?

355
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,742
You say your real name.

356
00:18:15,742 --> 00:18:17,663
I don't want to get into
this now.

357
00:18:17,663 --> 00:18:19,605
This is what I was
afraid would happen.

358
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,495
This is isn't us, it's them.
We're letting them in.

359
00:18:22,495 --> 00:18:25,342
Your name isn't asshole.
It's like your middle name.

360
00:18:25,342 --> 00:18:27,230
Don't wanna be
blindsided again.

361
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,015
Very funny. Go ahead
and take a shot at me.

362
00:18:30,015 --> 00:18:31,998
I have to deal
with those Neanderthals.

363
00:18:31,998 --> 00:18:33,786
I gotta take it from you.

364
00:18:33,855 --> 00:18:36,959
No, you shouldn't. You shouldn't
let them walk over you.

365
00:18:36,959 --> 00:18:39,774
Kate, they're trained
USC fighters.

366
00:18:39,774 --> 00:18:41,595
Know pressure
points on people.

367
00:18:41,662 --> 00:18:43,422
You're twice their size.

368
00:18:43,422 --> 00:18:45,437
They're semi-professional
cage fighters.

369
00:18:45,437 --> 00:18:47,421
Like one person comes out,
one doesn't.

370
00:18:47,421 --> 00:18:50,141
A cock fighting
but with dudes.

371
00:18:50,141 --> 00:18:53,116
-Said they're personal trainers.
-They're dude cock fighters.

372
00:18:53,116 --> 00:18:54,940
Like what you see on the PPV.

373
00:18:55,006 --> 00:18:57,886
Exactly. Except they don't
actually get paid for it.

374
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:59,773
They brawl
in people's backyards...

375
00:18:59,837 --> 00:19:01,821
...and they upload
the footage to YouTube.

376
00:19:01,821 --> 00:19:05,465
Honey, my childhood was just
like "Shawshank Redemption".

377
00:19:05,533 --> 00:19:08,605
Except I didn't have some kind,
older, soft spoken black man...

378
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:10,361
...to share my struggle with.

379
00:19:10,429 --> 00:19:12,404
But you're not
that child anymore, okay?

380
00:19:12,477 --> 00:19:16,949
You're a grown, strong,
confident, successful man.

381
00:19:17,181 --> 00:19:19,002
I don't want to get into this.

382
00:19:19,068 --> 00:19:22,779
Brad, just know the truth.
They're intimidated by you.

383
00:19:22,845 --> 00:19:24,732
What you need to do
is go out there...

384
00:19:24,796 --> 00:19:25,843
...and set some
boundaries...

385
00:19:26,556 --> 00:19:29,403
...and demand that
they respect you. You know?

386
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,517
Hey, big city, come to
open up some presents!

387
00:19:31,517 --> 00:19:34,265
-Come on, we gotta go!
-This is your opportunity.

388
00:19:34,492 --> 00:19:36,182
You can do this, baby.

389
00:19:40,987 --> 00:19:42,067
Right, right.

390
00:19:42,972 --> 00:19:43,986
Okay, gentlemen.

391
00:19:44,923 --> 00:19:46,810
Can we take it down
a notch, please?

392
00:19:47,673 --> 00:19:49,756
I'm not a kid, you can't
talk to me like that.

393
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:51,548
We're adults.
Understand?

394
00:19:51,548 --> 00:19:53,555
I'm a grown man
with hair on my chest, right?

395
00:19:53,628 --> 00:19:56,475
There's gonna be certain
boundaries between us.

396
00:19:57,372 --> 00:20:00,371
They might be invisible.
I know you won't see them...

397
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:04,017
...but you'll be able to respect
the fact that they're there.

398
00:20:04,187 --> 00:20:06,870
These boundaries
are not to be crossed.

399
00:20:07,034 --> 00:20:10,831
And if they're crossed, there's
gonna be real consequences.

400
00:20:14,683 --> 00:20:15,610
Thank you.

401
00:20:20,347 --> 00:20:22,169
Welcome back, stud!

402
00:20:23,226 --> 00:20:24,154
Don't!

403
00:20:24,251 --> 00:20:25,177
Stop!

404
00:20:29,947 --> 00:20:30,873
Stop it!

405
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:37,817
Come on, can I go in?

406
00:20:37,817 --> 00:20:40,538
No, you boys could get hurt.

407
00:20:40,538 --> 00:20:41,498
Come in!

408
00:20:41,498 --> 00:20:43,285
-Come on!
-Take us in!

409
00:20:43,352 --> 00:20:44,402
-Go!
-Yes!

410
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,009
Get it!

411
00:20:53,017 --> 00:20:54,032
Google me, bitch!

412
00:20:54,809 --> 00:20:55,027
What?

413
00:20:55,769 --> 00:20:57,908
Google. You might wanna
look me up sometime, Barbara!

414
00:20:58,841 --> 00:21:00,563
No! Dad!

415
00:21:00,728 --> 00:21:01,656
Stop!

416
00:21:02,551 --> 00:21:03,599
Let's open the presents...

417
00:21:03,672 --> 00:21:06,356
...so Orlando can get
to his other Christmases.

418
00:21:06,553 --> 00:21:07,480
Let's do it.

419
00:21:15,992 --> 00:21:16,919
Baby.

420
00:21:17,943 --> 00:21:19,799
It's me. It's me.
Are you okay?

421
00:21:20,727 --> 00:21:21,777
Did you break anything?

422
00:21:24,664 --> 00:21:26,452
I am so proud of you.

423
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,421
Orlando, just go to the tree.

424
00:21:36,216 --> 00:21:38,199
Gosh, wasn't it so
hard to find gifts...

425
00:21:38,199 --> 00:21:39,924
...under the 10 dollar cap?

426
00:21:39,992 --> 00:21:41,815
The first gift is to Connor.

427
00:21:41,815 --> 00:21:43,895
-The 10 dollar what?
-10 dollar spending cap.

428
00:21:43,895 --> 00:21:46,612
Uncle Brad and his special
friend Kate, maybe...

429
00:21:46,679 --> 00:21:47,606
Brad?

430
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:49,522
I'll be your nice uncle...

431
00:21:49,591 --> 00:21:51,533
...after you see what I got you.
Open it up.

432
00:21:53,303 --> 00:21:54,230
-Brad?
-Yeah.

433
00:21:54,453 --> 00:21:55,347
What?

434
00:21:55,413 --> 00:21:58,134
X-Box. This is awesome.

435
00:21:58,134 --> 00:21:59,223
Top shelf for you, pal.

436
00:21:59,223 --> 00:22:02,093
It's got the triple core
processor, the whole deal.

437
00:22:02,199 --> 00:22:04,087
It's a 10 dollar
spending cap.

438
00:22:04,087 --> 00:22:06,869
How did you find
an X-Box for under 10 dollars?

439
00:22:07,734 --> 00:22:10,614
Someone's trying to show off
how much money he makes.

440
00:22:10,614 --> 00:22:11,694
His family
didn't tell him...

441
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:13,654
...there's a 10 dollar
spending cap.

442
00:22:13,654 --> 00:22:16,534
Or maybe if you came home
you'd know crap like that.

443
00:22:16,534 --> 00:22:18,454
Can we try
to stay positive here?

444
00:22:18,454 --> 00:22:21,334
What's the problem? We're
trying to give some gifts.

445
00:22:21,334 --> 00:22:24,086
It's Christmas. Let's keep
the momentum going.

446
00:22:24,086 --> 00:22:28,843
The next gift is to Cody.
This is from your dad.

447
00:22:29,845 --> 00:22:31,821
I'm sure this is
a good gift too. Okay?

448
00:22:33,781 --> 00:22:35,473
Good, tear it up.

449
00:22:37,527 --> 00:22:38,573
A flashlight?

450
00:22:39,606 --> 00:22:41,231
That's it?

451
00:22:41,461 --> 00:22:43,317
Why don't you love me,
Daddy?

452
00:22:43,317 --> 00:22:46,293
Okay, okay. Honestly,
I think it's my fault.

453
00:22:46,293 --> 00:22:48,180
Didn't know about the
a 10 dollars.

454
00:22:48,245 --> 00:22:51,092
My gift from Santa Claus
better be straight cool.

455
00:22:51,797 --> 00:22:53,846
I have a feeling that your
gift from Santa...

456
00:22:53,846 --> 00:22:55,788
...will probably be
around 10 dollars too.

457
00:22:55,861 --> 00:22:58,645
Why? Is Santa Claus
cheap like my daddy?

458
00:22:58,645 --> 00:23:01,394
No, Santa is dad.
Dad is...

459
00:23:02,581 --> 00:23:03,508
Right.

460
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:05,450
I don't understand.

461
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:09,108
What's happening?
What's the problem?

462
00:23:10,035 --> 00:23:11,945
There's no Santa Claus.

463
00:23:12,213 --> 00:23:14,994
You're joking with me, right?
You're kidding me.

464
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,748
They know there's
no Santa Claus?

465
00:23:18,804 --> 00:23:19,765
They do now.

466
00:23:19,765 --> 00:23:21,651
How could you lie to us, Daddy?

467
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:22,732
There is a Santa Claus.

468
00:23:23,444 --> 00:23:23,695
Cody, come on.

469
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:26,379
You and Santa Claus
don't love me.

470
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,331
That's not gonna
bring back Santa. That's not...

471
00:23:29,331 --> 00:23:31,273
When he gets hurt inside
and can't get...

472
00:23:31,347 --> 00:23:34,064
...his emotions into words,
he takes to streaking.

473
00:23:36,018 --> 00:23:37,907
Don't worry,
he always comes back.

474
00:23:38,003 --> 00:23:39,759
Nobody loves me!

475
00:23:41,874 --> 00:23:44,627
Okay, look.
I'm really, really sorry.

476
00:23:44,627 --> 00:23:46,482
-I assumed...
-All right.

477
00:23:46,707 --> 00:23:48,435
Let's keep it moving.

478
00:23:48,435 --> 00:23:50,322
I'm starting to lose the balls.

479
00:23:50,547 --> 00:23:51,474
All right?

480
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:56,079
What's this one here?
You're gonna love this, dad.

481
00:23:56,242 --> 00:23:57,999
That's a satellite dish.

482
00:23:58,195 --> 00:23:59,922
Why would I want it?

483
00:23:59,922 --> 00:24:01,961
Not a satellite,
it's a satellite dish.

484
00:24:02,065 --> 00:24:04,913
Terrific. You get more
channels and viewing options.

485
00:24:04,913 --> 00:24:06,702
I don't get enough channels?

486
00:24:07,698 --> 00:24:09,746
Well, your TV right now
is a radio, so...

487
00:24:09,746 --> 00:24:10,706
Wait.

488
00:24:10,706 --> 00:24:14,284
How much does this gift
will cost me a month?

489
00:24:15,347 --> 00:24:17,329
Nothing.
We're paying for the services.

490
00:24:17,329 --> 00:24:19,238
-So, nothing actually.
-Wait, wait.

491
00:24:20,017 --> 00:24:22,033
Just because I drive
a van for a living...

492
00:24:22,033 --> 00:24:23,975
...doesn't mean I need
a fancy lawyer son...

493
00:24:24,049 --> 00:24:26,034
-...paying the bills for me.
-Okay, you win.

494
00:24:26,034 --> 00:24:28,684
If you want to pay,
wherever your want.

495
00:24:28,753 --> 00:24:31,600
The installation guy comes
on Tuesday, he'll install it.

496
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:33,648
Cancel it.
We install things ourselves.

497
00:24:33,648 --> 00:24:37,425
Dad, I think you'll want
a professional to handle this.

498
00:24:37,425 --> 00:24:40,142
If you think I'll allow
a sex predator...

499
00:24:40,305 --> 00:24:42,280
...in a uniform to wander
around my house...

500
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:44,137
...and touch my underwear...

501
00:24:45,105 --> 00:24:47,854
You can't... No, no.

502
00:24:48,817 --> 00:24:49,962
I'll see you outside in five.

503
00:24:50,704 --> 00:24:51,792
All three on the roof.

504
00:24:51,792 --> 00:24:52,775
-Let's go.
-Okay.

505
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,445
To her mother.
I gotta take a grumpy.

506
00:24:58,511 --> 00:24:59,460
What don't you...?

507
00:25:00,495 --> 00:25:02,318
You wanna go over
to your mom?

508
00:25:03,217 --> 00:25:07,111
Yeah, okay, come here.
Careful. There you go.

509
00:25:08,176 --> 00:25:10,826
Ain't it nice to have
everybody home?

510
00:25:10,895 --> 00:25:12,040
Yes, it is.

511
00:25:13,935 --> 00:25:16,618
We're gonna make
bologna sandwiches I think.

512
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,574
Okay, here we go.

513
00:25:23,471 --> 00:25:24,399
Okay.

514
00:25:25,263 --> 00:25:26,414
Take her before
it explodes.

515
00:25:26,414 --> 00:25:27,343
Thank you.

516
00:25:29,199 --> 00:25:31,054
Gotta go and do
some man's work.

517
00:25:41,744 --> 00:25:43,534
You gotta use
a lock nut.

518
00:25:43,534 --> 00:25:46,350
I know what I'm doing.
I don't need any lock nut.

519
00:25:46,350 --> 00:25:47,503
Sorry,
I know that you major...

520
00:25:47,503 --> 00:25:50,284
...in a satellite dish
installation at Stanford.

521
00:25:52,173 --> 00:25:53,101
Yeah.

522
00:25:53,262 --> 00:25:56,077
Great, dude. Mock me
for being educated. Awesome.

523
00:25:56,174 --> 00:25:57,931
-Hey, Grandpa!
-Hey!

524
00:25:58,831 --> 00:25:59,909
Come play War with me!

525
00:26:00,974 --> 00:26:02,829
Maybe later,
Grandpa is busy.

526
00:26:04,589 --> 00:26:07,436
Grandma's boyfriend
plays with me whenever I want.

527
00:26:07,629 --> 00:26:11,276
Your grandmother's boyfriend
is a first class ass sniffer.

528
00:26:11,276 --> 00:26:12,357
You can tell him
I said so.

529
00:26:12,493 --> 00:26:14,347
Connor, go get us
some beers, man.

530
00:26:16,302 --> 00:26:19,149
Sounds like you and mom
really turned a corner there.

531
00:26:20,109 --> 00:26:22,893
I don't want to speak ill
of her on Christmas.

532
00:26:22,893 --> 00:26:23,820
But...

533
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:25,933
...she's a common street whore.

534
00:26:25,933 --> 00:26:27,820
Okay, that's great.
Nicely said.

535
00:26:28,524 --> 00:26:30,412
What?
What do you call a woman...

536
00:26:30,477 --> 00:26:32,525
...who throws away a career,
abandons her kids...

537
00:26:32,525 --> 00:26:34,381
...and runs off
with another man?

538
00:26:34,381 --> 00:26:36,291
-What?
-What do you call her?

539
00:26:36,366 --> 00:26:39,149
Dad, she was a cashier,
that's not a career.

540
00:26:39,149 --> 00:26:42,124
That's a job. She left you
'cause you wouldn't talk to her.

541
00:26:42,124 --> 00:26:45,067
Stopped spending time with her.
Shut her out of you life.

542
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:48,744
I put a roof over her head.
And I never lied to her face.

543
00:26:48,811 --> 00:26:50,732
I spoiled her,
that's what I did.

544
00:26:50,732 --> 00:26:52,520
Let that be
a lesson to you...

545
00:26:52,588 --> 00:26:54,475
...about being
honest with your wives.

546
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:58,282
You can't spell "families"
without lies, am I right?

547
00:26:58,507 --> 00:27:00,198
-Amen, Dad.
-Yeah.

548
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:05,961
What is she like...
two or three months?

549
00:27:07,019 --> 00:27:08,842
-Nine.
-Wow.

550
00:27:08,842 --> 00:27:09,955
-Yeah.
-Nine months.

551
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:13,610
She's not walking or
taking care of herself by now?

552
00:27:13,677 --> 00:27:16,524
Are you kidding me?
Most days I'm lucky to get...

553
00:27:16,524 --> 00:27:18,498
...my boob out of her mouth
so I can shower.

554
00:27:18,635 --> 00:27:20,423
-Yeah.
-Does that hurt?

555
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,451
Breast feeding?

556
00:27:21,451 --> 00:27:22,378
No.

557
00:27:23,370 --> 00:27:26,184
Maybe at first, but
the nipples get tough.

558
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,000
I can hardly
feel mine anymore.

559
00:27:30,155 --> 00:27:31,813
You wanna flick one?

560
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:32,970
-No.
-Please.

561
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:33,918
-No, no.
-Go ahead.

562
00:27:34,026 --> 00:27:37,641
That's okay. I have a
set of my own. I pass.

563
00:27:37,641 --> 00:27:38,756
-Sure. Of course.
-But thanks.

564
00:27:39,691 --> 00:27:41,414
Okay, we're all set!

565
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,303
Hey!

566
00:27:43,562 --> 00:27:45,319
The picture's all fuzzy.

567
00:27:45,546 --> 00:27:48,395
Did you get me some
sort of cheap old satellite?

568
00:27:48,395 --> 00:27:50,314
No, it's not a cheap
old satellite.

569
00:27:50,314 --> 00:27:53,859
I just gotta adjust it.
How about now?

570
00:27:53,994 --> 00:27:54,953
Even worse!

571
00:27:54,953 --> 00:27:56,033
I can make it work!
Hold on!

572
00:27:56,746 --> 00:27:57,672
How about now?

573
00:27:57,897 --> 00:27:58,858
Dad...!

574
00:27:58,858 --> 00:28:01,672
Could you hold her?
I need to bake another thing.

575
00:28:01,672 --> 00:28:03,559
No, actually...
Okay.

576
00:28:04,552 --> 00:28:05,514
Okay.

577
00:28:05,514 --> 00:28:07,302
Come on,
you can't break her.

578
00:28:07,434 --> 00:28:08,458
-Okay.
-Yeah.

579
00:28:08,458 --> 00:28:09,440
Okay, you know what...?

580
00:28:10,249 --> 00:28:12,288
You gotta
point it up at the satellite.

581
00:28:12,361 --> 00:28:14,057
Is it better now?

582
00:28:14,057 --> 00:28:15,912
No, it's worse.
It's still crappy.

583
00:28:16,969 --> 00:28:18,080
I don't think she likes me.

584
00:28:18,824 --> 00:28:19,905
She likes you fine.

585
00:28:20,744 --> 00:28:22,719
Just give her a chance
to warm up to you.

586
00:28:22,921 --> 00:28:25,539
-How about now?
-Worse. It's worse.

587
00:28:25,608 --> 00:28:26,557
Son of a bitch.

588
00:28:27,656 --> 00:28:30,558
Take the damn thing down. I
can do better with rabbit ears.

589
00:28:31,273 --> 00:28:32,319
I love my rabbit ears!

590
00:28:36,136 --> 00:28:37,257
Tell me "hot or cold".

591
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:38,979
-What?
-Hot or cold.

592
00:28:39,047 --> 00:28:42,789
Hot or cold what?
What the hell does that mean?

593
00:28:43,848 --> 00:28:45,735
How long until
she warms up to me?

594
00:28:45,928 --> 00:28:47,618
Not long at all.

595
00:28:49,639 --> 00:28:50,727
-Horrible.
-Point it up!

596
00:28:50,727 --> 00:28:52,455
Shut up, let me work!

597
00:28:52,455 --> 00:28:55,430
I don't want a fancy satellite.
I don't want any satellite.

598
00:28:55,430 --> 00:28:59,075
It's not a satellite, genius!
It's a satellite dish!

599
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:00,999
Okay.

600
00:29:01,095 --> 00:29:03,136
-Pull the thing and...
-Get off my roof!

601
00:29:04,102 --> 00:29:05,794
Pull the damn thing!

602
00:29:19,269 --> 00:29:20,230
It's too much.

603
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:22,237
Whatever you're doing,
stop it right now!

604
00:29:22,342 --> 00:29:24,164
-Leave my TV alone!
-I'm fine!

605
00:29:27,046 --> 00:29:28,028
She stopped crying.

606
00:29:29,031 --> 00:29:29,924
I did it!

607
00:29:29,990 --> 00:29:31,813
You idiot! Stop it!

608
00:29:33,702 --> 00:29:35,644
-This is all right.
-Leave my TV alone!

609
00:29:37,477 --> 00:29:38,406
I'm fine.

610
00:29:39,590 --> 00:29:40,538
That's awesome.

611
00:29:40,614 --> 00:29:42,403
Okay, I'm coming up.

612
00:30:03,462 --> 00:30:04,508
Give me back my baby!

613
00:30:07,364 --> 00:30:08,312
Mistletoe.

614
00:30:12,259 --> 00:30:13,852
Mistletoe.

615
00:30:19,748 --> 00:30:21,796
I can't believe I nailed
that baby's head.

616
00:30:21,796 --> 00:30:23,492
I feel kind of bad.

617
00:30:23,492 --> 00:30:26,500
That's my brother's kid. You
couldn't avoid it. It's fine.

618
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,547
I did get her
to stop crying for a second.

619
00:30:28,547 --> 00:30:30,401
I think she kinds of likes me.

620
00:30:31,235 --> 00:30:32,195
Yeah.

621
00:30:32,195 --> 00:30:35,098
Know what happens to your
nipples after your breast feed?

622
00:30:36,132 --> 00:30:37,187
I don't wanna know.

623
00:30:37,187 --> 00:30:39,772
No, I don't think you do.
It's violent.

624
00:30:40,002 --> 00:30:42,687
-They crack up like tire rubber.
-Okay.

625
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:51,450
Just so you know, it's a bit of
a cougar den here at my Mom's.

626
00:30:53,442 --> 00:30:54,391
This is different.

627
00:30:58,082 --> 00:30:59,904
Maybe she has
a new boyfriend.

628
00:31:05,826 --> 00:31:06,850
Merry Christmas, Mom.

629
00:31:06,850 --> 00:31:09,539
Merry Christmas, Kate.
Come on in.

630
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:10,488
Merry Christmas.

631
00:31:13,635 --> 00:31:15,325
Give me a hug, Kate.

632
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,387
Oh, okay.

633
00:31:17,474 --> 00:31:19,068
Good to see you.

634
00:31:19,139 --> 00:31:20,194
And you must be Brad.

635
00:31:20,194 --> 00:31:21,121
Mrs. Kincaid.

636
00:31:22,018 --> 00:31:23,873
Call me Marilyn and get
over here...

637
00:31:23,938 --> 00:31:26,010
...and give me a hug,
you big, fat, purple teddy bear.

638
00:31:26,849 --> 00:31:27,777
Bring it!

639
00:31:27,873 --> 00:31:29,729
-Yes, yes!
-Hey, Merry Christmas.

640
00:31:31,617 --> 00:31:32,632
Shit, that feels good.

641
00:31:33,698 --> 00:31:36,382
You're so tall and firm
like a giant oak.

642
00:31:37,345 --> 00:31:38,425
He's tall.

643
00:31:40,449 --> 00:31:42,359
-Brad, this is my aunt Sarah.
-Hi.

644
00:31:43,073 --> 00:31:44,225
-This is my aunt Donna.
-Hi.

645
00:31:44,225 --> 00:31:47,007
-Genuine leather.
-Nice to meet you, ladies.

646
00:31:47,073 --> 00:31:50,018
The one in the canarian hanging
on your belt is Gram Gram.

647
00:31:50,018 --> 00:31:52,833
Sorry, but that's my belt.
That's attached to me.

648
00:31:52,833 --> 00:31:55,647
Sorry. Merry Christmas to you.
It's a great sweater.

649
00:31:55,808 --> 00:31:56,736
I get it.

650
00:31:58,688 --> 00:32:02,234
This is the den. Well,
everyone's here.

651
00:32:03,392 --> 00:32:05,313
I can't believe you came.

652
00:32:05,313 --> 00:32:07,234
-Hi, Courtney.
-Hi, sweetie.

653
00:32:07,234 --> 00:32:09,952
I can't get up.
Jackson is very gassy...

654
00:32:09,952 --> 00:32:11,138
...and I gotta keep
bouncing him.

655
00:32:11,138 --> 00:32:12,096
Okay.

656
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:13,951
-Well, this is Brad.
-Hi.

657
00:32:14,944 --> 00:32:15,871
Hi.

658
00:32:15,968 --> 00:32:17,561
I'm Courtney.

659
00:32:17,856 --> 00:32:20,473
-Brad. Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

660
00:32:21,503 --> 00:32:22,485
And that's Granddad.

661
00:32:23,390 --> 00:32:25,302
And this is
Courtney's husband, Jim.

662
00:32:25,408 --> 00:32:27,196
-Take Jackson.
-All right.

663
00:32:27,392 --> 00:32:30,109
He's so good with kids.
Yeah.

664
00:32:30,176 --> 00:32:32,192
-We're gonna try again.
-Well...

665
00:32:32,192 --> 00:32:35,006
You're too cool for kids.
It ruins your independence.

666
00:32:35,072 --> 00:32:37,759
I never said
I was too cool for kids.

667
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:39,903
I know you didn't say it.
But you don't have any.

668
00:32:39,903 --> 00:32:43,580
And you have really strong
ideas about not having them.

669
00:32:43,743 --> 00:32:45,499
Well, that's actually not...

670
00:32:46,431 --> 00:32:48,285
I'd rather just not get into it.

671
00:32:48,478 --> 00:32:49,405
Where's Kasi?

672
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,341
She's outside in the jump-jump
with the rest of the kids.

673
00:32:53,183 --> 00:32:54,165
There's a jump-jump?

674
00:32:57,022 --> 00:32:58,142
Kate hated
the jump-jump.

675
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:01,819
In the 5th grade, kids trapped
her inside of the jump-jump.

676
00:33:01,951 --> 00:33:04,606
-She never got over it.
-I got over it.

677
00:33:04,606 --> 00:33:06,581
They tortured her
for about an hour.

678
00:33:06,654 --> 00:33:08,476
Why would they
trapped her in?

679
00:33:09,502 --> 00:33:10,450
Because she was...

680
00:33:11,454 --> 00:33:12,413
..."Cootie Kate".

681
00:33:12,413 --> 00:33:13,341
Courtney.

682
00:33:14,270 --> 00:33:15,217
Who's Cootie Kate?

683
00:33:15,293 --> 00:33:18,268
-She didn't tell you?
-This isn't necessary.

684
00:33:18,268 --> 00:33:21,022
All the kids pretended
that Kate had cooties...

685
00:33:21,022 --> 00:33:22,778
...and no one talked to her.

686
00:33:22,846 --> 00:33:25,022
If Kate even touched you,
you'd have to wipe it off...

687
00:33:25,022 --> 00:33:27,705
...and spray with disinfectant
to get it off.

688
00:33:27,774 --> 00:33:30,685
That sounds hurtful.
How long did that go along for?

689
00:33:30,685 --> 00:33:32,540
Not long. I don't remember.

690
00:33:32,540 --> 00:33:33,629
Seven years. Until 6th.

691
00:33:33,629 --> 00:33:35,420
That was a long time ago.

692
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,436
I'm sure you don't
have cooties now.

693
00:33:37,436 --> 00:33:38,364
Let's test it.

694
00:33:39,133 --> 00:33:40,060
Cooties!

695
00:33:44,124 --> 00:33:47,997
Pastor Phil has encouraged us
to dispense...

696
00:33:47,997 --> 00:33:50,781
...with the commercial
trappings of the holidays.

697
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:52,604
-Pastor Phil?
-Mom's new beau.

698
00:33:52,604 --> 00:33:53,651
It's a whole new thing.

699
00:33:54,620 --> 00:33:55,547
So...

700
00:33:55,675 --> 00:33:58,294
...what I had in mind
was that...

701
00:33:58,364 --> 00:34:01,212
...we'd go around the room
and each of us...

702
00:34:01,212 --> 00:34:04,310
...would speak to the spiritual
gifts that we might give.

703
00:34:05,020 --> 00:34:07,124
A verbal gift giving of sorts.

704
00:34:08,028 --> 00:34:10,011
Wait. There's
really no presents.

705
00:34:10,011 --> 00:34:10,939
Kasi.

706
00:34:11,804 --> 00:34:13,625
None that you can see.

707
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:14,834
Okay, I'll go first.

708
00:34:15,772 --> 00:34:18,620
I'd like give more
of myself to my church...

709
00:34:18,620 --> 00:34:20,408
...and to Pastor Phil.

710
00:34:25,307 --> 00:34:27,216
Gram-Gram,
would you like to go next?

711
00:34:28,122 --> 00:34:31,024
I could increase the frequency
with which...

712
00:34:31,162 --> 00:34:34,872
...I pleasure Milton with
my hand and with my mouth.

713
00:34:36,923 --> 00:34:38,613
Did she just say that?

714
00:34:40,763 --> 00:34:42,551
Brad, why don't you go next?

715
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:46,233
I follow Gram-Gram
with that...

716
00:34:47,322 --> 00:34:50,256
...hand stuff and what she
does with her... Yeah, okay?

717
00:34:51,098 --> 00:34:52,026
I'd like to...

718
00:34:53,242 --> 00:34:54,868
...with Kate...

719
00:34:55,961 --> 00:34:56,910
...would be too...

720
00:34:58,745 --> 00:35:01,712
Vacationing more frequently
and do in it with Kate.

721
00:35:02,809 --> 00:35:04,632
That is lovely, Brad.

722
00:35:04,697 --> 00:35:08,474
-He's so well spoken.
-Thank you. Thank you.

723
00:35:08,474 --> 00:35:10,263
Courtney,
what would you give?

724
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:12,218
Well, I'd like
to give myself a gift.

725
00:35:12,282 --> 00:35:14,256
And that is the gift
of being pregnant.

726
00:35:16,025 --> 00:35:19,033
I know that comes with its
own challenges for 9 months...

727
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:21,782
...Iike getting fat and
people stare at you funny...

728
00:35:21,848 --> 00:35:22,863
...when you sneak a cig.

729
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,752
I'd like to give
myself another gift.

730
00:35:25,752 --> 00:35:27,694
And that is a scheduled
a C-section.

731
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:33,302
Don't most women want
to have a natural birth?

732
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:35,417
Yeah, women who haven't
done it before.

733
00:35:35,417 --> 00:35:36,343
Right.

734
00:35:39,032 --> 00:35:40,112
You just come here.

735
00:35:41,912 --> 00:35:43,864
Auntie Kate,
will you please hold him?

736
00:35:43,864 --> 00:35:44,888
What do I do?

737
00:35:44,888 --> 00:35:46,777
You gotta hold him.
Okay, got him?

738
00:35:46,777 --> 00:35:49,777
I'll fix myself here.
There we go.

739
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:52,568
-What should I do?
-See if he made a stinky.

740
00:35:52,568 --> 00:35:53,516
How do I do that?

741
00:35:53,591 --> 00:35:56,309
Just lift up his diaper
and see if he made one.

742
00:35:59,288 --> 00:36:01,076
There's
something in here.

743
00:36:01,303 --> 00:36:03,059
It's a really disgusting...

744
00:36:04,056 --> 00:36:04,982
Jackson...

745
00:36:06,872 --> 00:36:08,813
You project it on auntie Kate.

746
00:36:10,775 --> 00:36:12,824
-I'm gonna vomit.
-Brad, are you okay?

747
00:36:12,824 --> 00:36:14,513
Get him some water.

748
00:36:14,743 --> 00:36:16,565
-I'm about to throw up.
-Oh, God.

749
00:36:18,358 --> 00:36:19,503
I'll get sick. I can't be here.

750
00:36:20,406 --> 00:36:21,355
What do I do?

751
00:36:21,463 --> 00:36:23,319
Take it away.
Sorry. I love you.

752
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:25,206
You gotta get out.
I can't breathe.

753
00:36:26,103 --> 00:36:27,086
I want to do it too!

754
00:36:28,087 --> 00:36:29,069
-Kate!
-What?

755
00:36:34,838 --> 00:36:37,707
Are you joking me? These
are the only clothes we have?

756
00:36:38,582 --> 00:36:39,563
How's that possible?

757
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:43,307
It's not like you come around.
Haven't been here in... Forever.

758
00:36:43,381 --> 00:36:46,165
Can't believe you told him
about "Cootie Kate".

759
00:36:46,165 --> 00:36:48,118
How's I to know
you hadn't told him?

760
00:36:48,118 --> 00:36:50,134
You'd tell Jim you're
"Cootie Courtney".

761
00:36:50,134 --> 00:36:52,118
We know
everything there is to know.

762
00:36:52,118 --> 00:36:54,837
He knows I slept with
the water polo team.

763
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:56,778
Like I know he
experimented with men.

764
00:36:57,750 --> 00:37:00,695
-I didn't need to know that.
-My point: after three years...

765
00:37:00,695 --> 00:37:02,517
...I'd think that
you and Brad...

766
00:37:02,517 --> 00:37:04,525
...would know a little more
about yourselves.

767
00:37:05,365 --> 00:37:07,470
How can you appreciate
someone for who they are...

768
00:37:08,276 --> 00:37:09,389
...until you really know them?

769
00:37:15,989 --> 00:37:16,916
Thank you.

770
00:37:17,812 --> 00:37:19,820
I kind of feel like a
Saudi prince in here.

771
00:37:20,725 --> 00:37:22,699
We're so glad that
Kate has a boyfriend.

772
00:37:22,805 --> 00:37:26,416
You're the longest relationship
she's ever had with a man.

773
00:37:29,428 --> 00:37:30,356
With a man?

774
00:37:57,235 --> 00:37:58,217
What's this?

775
00:38:15,474 --> 00:38:16,402
Oh, my God.

776
00:38:38,355 --> 00:38:39,282
Who's that?

777
00:38:39,410 --> 00:38:40,424
That's Josephine.

778
00:38:40,497 --> 00:38:43,311
Everyone called her Joe.
She was Kate's only friend.

779
00:38:44,306 --> 00:38:46,988
Last I heard, Joe coaches
women's wrestling.

780
00:38:52,849 --> 00:38:53,777
Check that out!

781
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,621
-That's Kate?
-Yeah.

782
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:58,600
She looks like Shaq.

783
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:14,789
Hi, auntie Kate.

784
00:39:15,824 --> 00:39:17,734
-Hi, Kasi.
-What are you doing?

785
00:39:18,832 --> 00:39:21,514
Not much. Do you need
to use the bathroom?

786
00:39:21,775 --> 00:39:23,369
What's this?

787
00:39:26,289 --> 00:39:28,361
That is my
special magic marker.

788
00:39:30,385 --> 00:39:31,345
What?

789
00:39:31,345 --> 00:39:33,232
We can't
have magic markers.

790
00:39:33,232 --> 00:39:36,941
-I have to tell my mom.
-No. You don't need to do it.

791
00:39:37,008 --> 00:39:38,917
Actually, can I have it back
because...

792
00:39:41,678 --> 00:39:42,638
Kasi.

793
00:39:42,638 --> 00:39:43,567
You want this?

794
00:39:44,526 --> 00:39:46,438
This is not a joke,
this is not game.

795
00:39:47,376 --> 00:39:49,318
Auntie Kate needs
her marker back, okay?

796
00:39:52,272 --> 00:39:53,352
Kasi, this is not funny!

797
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:21,038
Kasi,
please come out of there!

798
00:40:21,103 --> 00:40:22,924
Don't make me
come and get you.

799
00:40:24,782 --> 00:40:25,710
Kasi!

800
00:40:25,998 --> 00:40:26,892
Come on!

801
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:28,616
Come and get it!

802
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:51,885
Wait.
Kate went to a fat camp?

803
00:40:51,885 --> 00:40:55,497
Yeah, she lost three pounds.
It only took her all summer.

804
00:40:55,661 --> 00:40:56,588
A pound a month.

805
00:40:57,484 --> 00:40:58,412
Courtney.

806
00:41:00,301 --> 00:41:03,148
Kasi, honey. Please
give back that marker!

807
00:41:03,405 --> 00:41:04,332
Keep away!

808
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,972
Come and get it, old lady!

809
00:41:08,972 --> 00:41:09,934
What?

810
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:11,012
Keep away! Keep away!

811
00:41:11,084 --> 00:41:12,012
Give it to me!

812
00:41:12,749 --> 00:41:13,708
"Give it to me."

813
00:41:13,708 --> 00:41:14,892
Just give me the marker.
Okay?

814
00:41:14,892 --> 00:41:17,542
"Just give me the marker.
Okay?"

815
00:41:18,540 --> 00:41:20,450
Come and get it!
Sucker!

816
00:41:24,396 --> 00:41:25,322
Get it!

817
00:41:30,124 --> 00:41:31,050
Yeah!

818
00:41:32,139 --> 00:41:33,121
-That's Kate?
-Yes.

819
00:41:33,834 --> 00:41:35,788
Wait. Hold on.
You told me... Who's that?

820
00:41:35,788 --> 00:41:37,796
-That's Kate.
-That's not a boy named Bjorn?

821
00:41:48,394 --> 00:41:51,146
Can't believe it. Kate's
playing with Kasi.

822
00:41:51,146 --> 00:41:53,186
I've never seen her
play with my kids before.

823
00:41:54,121 --> 00:41:56,065
Hey! Okay!

824
00:41:59,786 --> 00:42:00,768
Mistletoe!

825
00:42:02,634 --> 00:42:04,544
Brad! Mistletoe!

826
00:42:05,707 --> 00:42:07,397
Mistletoe!

827
00:42:07,531 --> 00:42:10,345
-We're so glad you're here.
-I'm having so much fun.

828
00:42:11,337 --> 00:42:14,305
What did she take so long to
bring you? Is what I wanna know.

829
00:42:32,491 --> 00:42:34,278
I came here for a marker...

830
00:42:34,505 --> 00:42:37,156
...and I'm not leaving
without one!

831
00:42:55,561 --> 00:42:56,489
Kasi!

832
00:42:59,209 --> 00:43:02,078
That marker in your mouth,
I peed on it!

833
00:43:40,421 --> 00:43:41,350
Hey!

834
00:43:42,502 --> 00:43:44,476
You never told me
you went to a fat camp.

835
00:43:45,350 --> 00:43:47,143
It was: "Get fit camp".

836
00:43:47,143 --> 00:43:49,990
I can't believe my family
is showing you the pictures.

837
00:43:50,054 --> 00:43:51,942
My favorites are
when you're a baby...

838
00:43:52,007 --> 00:43:53,981
...'cause it looks almost
like you're a twin...

839
00:43:54,054 --> 00:43:55,942
-...but you ate the other baby.
-Brad.

840
00:43:55,942 --> 00:43:57,861
-That's why you're powerful.
-Stop.

841
00:43:57,861 --> 00:44:00,677
You ate your twin sister,
took all of her powers.

842
00:44:00,677 --> 00:44:02,466
-Cut it out.
-Baby, I love you.

843
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:05,543
It doesn't bother me if you
were a really large child...

844
00:44:05,543 --> 00:44:08,324
...with lesbian tendencies,
if that was your journey...

845
00:44:08,389 --> 00:44:11,203
-...then I'm cool with it.
-What lesbian tendencies?

846
00:44:11,269 --> 00:44:14,139
-I saw the pictures of Joe.
-Joe wasn't gay.

847
00:44:14,246 --> 00:44:17,988
Haircuts don't lie.
What did you do with Joe...

848
00:44:17,988 --> 00:44:20,006
...Iike play baseball
and ride motorcycles?

849
00:44:20,006 --> 00:44:22,758
We're just kids.
She was really imaginative.

850
00:44:22,758 --> 00:44:25,669
We played in the basement.
She had this game: "Sun tan".

851
00:44:25,669 --> 00:44:28,453
Pretended we're on the
beach, she'd take lotion...

852
00:44:28,453 --> 00:44:30,492
...she never wanted me to burn,
so she'd rub it...

853
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:35,107
Okay, listen and look at me.
You are better.

854
00:44:35,300 --> 00:44:39,076
I'm saying it's not fun when
the shoes are in the other foot.

855
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:41,061
You shouldn't
have been shitty to me...

856
00:44:41,061 --> 00:44:43,908
...when you have so many
skeletons in your own closet.

857
00:44:44,709 --> 00:44:47,578
Do not throw rocks when
you live in the house of Joe.

858
00:44:47,781 --> 00:44:48,729
I see your point.

859
00:44:48,805 --> 00:44:51,423
I love you.
I'll see you in a little bit.

860
00:44:56,323 --> 00:44:57,251
Mom.

861
00:44:58,371 --> 00:45:00,260
I need to talk
to you for a sec.

862
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:03,804
I don't have time. I don't
wanna be late for Pastor Phil.

863
00:45:03,874 --> 00:45:04,803
But I just...

864
00:45:05,028 --> 00:45:06,755
I want to talk now.

865
00:45:06,755 --> 00:45:09,689
If it's important now, it'll be
important after church, right?

866
00:45:10,819 --> 00:45:11,780
Yeah...

867
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:14,562
Clean yourself up a little,
this is a nice church.

868
00:45:26,083 --> 00:45:27,969
And now...

869
00:45:28,803 --> 00:45:32,763
...the Pastor Phil!

870
00:45:33,570 --> 00:45:36,669
Hello. There's a new born King.
Hallelujah!

871
00:45:37,699 --> 00:45:39,357
Hallelujah!

872
00:45:39,619 --> 00:45:41,406
Praise Him!
Hallelujah!

873
00:45:42,403 --> 00:45:45,216
Praise Him!
Talk to Him, lady!

874
00:45:47,106 --> 00:45:48,928
Glory to the new born King!

875
00:45:50,145 --> 00:45:51,803
Hallelujah!

876
00:45:54,882 --> 00:45:55,829
Please be seated.

877
00:45:59,683 --> 00:46:01,405
I've been given a note.

878
00:46:01,601 --> 00:46:03,490
The Walshes
performed the role...

879
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:06,274
...of Mary and Joseph
for the last three years...

880
00:46:06,274 --> 00:46:08,345
...they've done a great job,
but some didn't agree.

881
00:46:09,056 --> 00:46:11,008
So, we'll need a pair
of volunteers...

882
00:46:11,008 --> 00:46:12,950
...to perform the roles
of Mary and Joseph.

883
00:46:16,833 --> 00:46:17,781
You should do it.

884
00:46:17,857 --> 00:46:18,750
What?

885
00:46:18,848 --> 00:46:21,664
No, I won't get in front
of a bunch of strangers.

886
00:46:21,664 --> 00:46:24,534
You're staged trained. You
played Pippin in High School.

887
00:46:24,672 --> 00:46:27,520
No. I wasn't Pippin,
I was in Pippin.

888
00:46:28,256 --> 00:46:31,200
I played a tree because I had
a bad stage fright, remember?

889
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,168
This seems like I'm putting you
on the spot and in fact I am.

890
00:46:34,945 --> 00:46:36,984
Honey,
Pastor Phil needs you.

891
00:46:37,888 --> 00:46:39,871
-I'm not gonna do it.
-A volunteer?

892
00:46:39,871 --> 00:46:41,694
Or do I still need
a volunteer?

893
00:46:43,615 --> 00:46:44,799
Kate will play
the Virgin Mary.

894
00:46:44,799 --> 00:46:45,759
What?

895
00:46:45,759 --> 00:46:47,679
Hallelujah!
The cure of the world!

896
00:46:47,679 --> 00:46:49,403
I just said I wouldn't.

897
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:52,318
Hallelujah!
Kate, you stand up!

898
00:46:52,417 --> 00:46:53,398
Stand up, please!

899
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:57,119
Look at the joy you've brought
to this congregation...

900
00:46:57,119 --> 00:46:59,008
...by your volunteering
to be Mary.

901
00:46:59,008 --> 00:47:01,014
Hello.
I still need a Joseph.

902
00:47:02,911 --> 00:47:03,859
Brad, be Joseph.

903
00:47:03,935 --> 00:47:06,654
Not staged trained.
I never played Pippin.

904
00:47:06,654 --> 00:47:08,662
It's not the performance.
You have to get up.

905
00:47:08,735 --> 00:47:11,484
-I don't wanna be alone.
-It's not gonna happen.

906
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:12,565
Brad, you stand up!

907
00:47:13,534 --> 00:47:15,324
You're a part of this, Brad!

908
00:47:33,629 --> 00:47:36,412
Listen, Brad. I need
to look out for me up there.

909
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:39,293
Because I'm starting
to get like really nervous.

910
00:47:39,293 --> 00:47:41,268
-That stage fright thing.
-How do I look?

911
00:47:43,038 --> 00:47:45,144
-What do you think?
-You look fine. I'm trying to...

912
00:47:45,214 --> 00:47:47,833
My man's skirt, is it
short or is okay?

913
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:48,980
-Honestly.
-Little short.

914
00:47:49,053 --> 00:47:50,909
Okay, here's Jesus.

915
00:47:51,965 --> 00:47:53,657
They don't use a doll?

916
00:47:54,589 --> 00:47:56,476
-Here are your scripts.
-Scripts?

917
00:47:56,604 --> 00:47:58,546
-I'm not ready for scripts...
-Hi, Jesus.

918
00:47:58,684 --> 00:48:00,473
No one said
there'll be lines...

919
00:48:00,541 --> 00:48:03,227
-Hi, Jesus.
-Actually, his name's Bernard.

920
00:48:03,227 --> 00:48:05,149
Okay.
Hi, Bernard.

921
00:48:05,149 --> 00:48:08,062
Okay, I got lines. I gotta
try to get my voice ready.

922
00:48:08,062 --> 00:48:11,005
Red leather. Yellow leather.
Red leather. Yellow leather.

923
00:48:11,005 --> 00:48:12,728
This is a good baby.

924
00:48:12,924 --> 00:48:14,647
Look at this baby.

925
00:48:14,844 --> 00:48:17,626
Baby, baby Jesus
is really kind of cute.

926
00:48:17,821 --> 00:48:20,503
This child is a blessing
to the both of us.

927
00:48:20,699 --> 00:48:21,628
Really?

928
00:48:22,493 --> 00:48:24,467
What, do you think
I should do it bigger?

929
00:48:24,541 --> 00:48:28,087
Should I do: "This child's
a blessing for the both of us.

930
00:48:28,157 --> 00:48:29,340
I'm not angry.
I'm inspired.

931
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:32,154
Oh, my God. There's so many
ways to play this thing.

932
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:34,141
Can I ask you
a question seriously?

933
00:48:34,141 --> 00:48:36,828
My wife is pregnant,
but is not my child.

934
00:48:36,828 --> 00:48:39,642
But I'm cool with it because
God got her pregnant?

935
00:48:43,451 --> 00:48:45,339
Are we ready
to see the result...

936
00:48:45,405 --> 00:48:47,258
...of that
immaculate conception?

937
00:48:47,451 --> 00:48:49,174
Hallelujah!

938
00:48:49,243 --> 00:48:51,185
Brad, I don't feel good.

939
00:48:51,355 --> 00:48:53,146
You should
hold the baby.

940
00:48:53,146 --> 00:48:55,129
Sweetheart, I gotta get ready.

941
00:48:55,129 --> 00:48:57,813
Just remember:
acting is reacting.

942
00:48:58,009 --> 00:49:00,694
And Joseph and Mary,
went from Galilee...

943
00:49:00,764 --> 00:49:01,941
...and out of the city
of Nazareth.

944
00:49:02,652 --> 00:49:06,447
Okay, find your truth.
I'll finish this bitch.

945
00:49:12,345 --> 00:49:13,273
Brad.

946
00:49:14,170 --> 00:49:15,161
I can't do this.

947
00:49:15,161 --> 00:49:17,203
Check it out, baby.
They're getting my walk.

948
00:49:24,858 --> 00:49:28,655
Because there was no room,
they stayed in the stable.

949
00:49:31,450 --> 00:49:34,298
And Mary wrapped the baby
in swaddling clothes...

950
00:49:34,298 --> 00:49:35,442
...and placed him
in a manger.

951
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:48,953
And Mary wrapped the baby
in swaddling clothes...

952
00:49:48,953 --> 00:49:51,571
...and placed him in a manger.

953
00:49:54,682 --> 00:49:56,404
Put it in it.

954
00:49:58,489 --> 00:50:00,377
Brad, help me swaddle.

955
00:50:00,377 --> 00:50:02,319
Gotta save my line.,
losing the audience.

956
00:50:02,393 --> 00:50:04,083
It's death out there.

957
00:50:04,183 --> 00:50:05,112
Come on, Mary!

958
00:50:08,024 --> 00:50:10,740
This child is a blessing
for the both of us.

959
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:12,728
Amen!

960
00:50:13,752 --> 00:50:14,734
That's right!

961
00:50:18,648 --> 00:50:19,576
Your line.

962
00:50:22,296 --> 00:50:23,288
I forgot my line.

963
00:50:23,288 --> 00:50:25,109
-What?
-I forgot my line.

964
00:50:25,336 --> 00:50:27,245
Thank goodness
I memorize yours too.

965
00:50:29,016 --> 00:50:30,095
We shall name him Jesus.

966
00:50:31,896 --> 00:50:33,783
Glory to God!

967
00:50:34,936 --> 00:50:37,837
And peace on earth
to the highest point on earth!

968
00:50:42,422 --> 00:50:44,430
This thing isn't big
enough to swaddle him.

969
00:50:44,502 --> 00:50:46,456
Someone's got to give
a performance.

970
00:50:46,456 --> 00:50:49,204
I'm nervous. I can't feel my
legs. Don't do this.

971
00:50:49,271 --> 00:50:51,181
It'd appear
that my wife is better at...

972
00:50:52,024 --> 00:50:54,958
...making babies than
swaddling them, no? Yes?

973
00:50:58,710 --> 00:51:01,557
Brad, you're wearing the
swaddling cloth on your belt.

974
00:51:01,622 --> 00:51:05,516
Woman, do your job
and swaddle this baby!

975
00:51:05,589 --> 00:51:09,238
Brad, I can't. You're wearing
the swaddle around your belt!

976
00:51:09,238 --> 00:51:12,183
Enough! This child's
life is now in jeopardy.

977
00:51:12,183 --> 00:51:15,052
Unfit mother, give me this baby.

978
00:51:17,910 --> 00:51:22,731
And l, Joseph,
shall swaddle this baby!

979
00:51:23,701 --> 00:51:27,663
And l, Joseph,
will protect this child.

980
00:51:28,661 --> 00:51:30,351
Forgive her, son...

981
00:51:30,548 --> 00:51:35,121
...for she knows not
what she's done!

982
00:51:41,044 --> 00:51:41,972
Yeah!

983
00:51:49,749 --> 00:51:50,675
Hallelujah!

984
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:52,628
That's the message
of Christmas.

985
00:51:54,420 --> 00:51:55,403
Hallelujah!

986
00:51:59,220 --> 00:52:00,234
Hallelujah!

987
00:52:03,157 --> 00:52:04,814
Brad, that was...!

988
00:52:06,869 --> 00:52:09,770
All is calm.

989
00:52:10,611 --> 00:52:13,513
All is bright.

990
00:52:13,716 --> 00:52:20,360
Round you
Virgin Mother and Child.

991
00:52:21,171 --> 00:52:26,987
Holy infant
so tender and mild.

992
00:52:27,859 --> 00:52:29,900
I know how Celine Dion
feels after one shows.

993
00:52:29,972 --> 00:52:31,987
You give,
you're not getting a lot back.

994
00:52:31,987 --> 00:52:34,802
-I got back to you.
-You feel like Celine Dion?

995
00:52:34,802 --> 00:52:36,755
How do you calm down
of such a high?

996
00:52:36,755 --> 00:52:38,511
It's difficult to do that.

997
00:52:38,579 --> 00:52:40,531
I can't believe
you threw me down...

998
00:52:40,531 --> 00:52:42,319
...in front of the
congregation.

999
00:52:42,386 --> 00:52:43,467
You're thinking
about you.

1000
00:52:44,179 --> 00:52:46,130
I was thinking about
the entire show.

1001
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:47,251
Frankly,
with you there...

1002
00:52:47,251 --> 00:52:49,041
...I brought
the thing home.

1003
00:52:49,041 --> 00:52:49,990
-My God.
-I did.

1004
00:52:50,098 --> 00:52:52,018
-ls this how it's gonna be?
-What?

1005
00:52:52,018 --> 00:52:54,001
-What are you saying?
-I'd like to know...

1006
00:52:54,001 --> 00:52:55,859
...you'll be
for me in a crisis.

1007
00:52:55,859 --> 00:52:57,810
If we're on a plane,
it's going down.

1008
00:52:57,810 --> 00:52:59,538
I passed out,
and say:

1009
00:52:59,538 --> 00:53:00,619
"Put on your
oxygen mask."

1010
00:53:00,691 --> 00:53:03,537
I'd like to know that you'd
put mine on, before yours.

1011
00:53:04,499 --> 00:53:07,247
I wouldn't. FAA wouldn't
want me to do it either.

1012
00:53:07,314 --> 00:53:09,298
-I'm not... FAA?
-lf you'd listen...

1013
00:53:09,298 --> 00:53:11,272
-What?
-Do you ever listen?

1014
00:53:11,985 --> 00:53:14,155
Or are you too busy moving
your BlackBerry?

1015
00:53:14,865 --> 00:53:16,904
-I listen to the stewardesses.
-When they say...

1016
00:53:16,977 --> 00:53:19,846
...that you're supposed to put
your mask on in an emergency...

1017
00:53:19,920 --> 00:53:21,809
...before you try to help
out a child.

1018
00:53:22,545 --> 00:53:23,761
-I've heard her.
-lf you pass out...

1019
00:53:23,761 --> 00:53:26,545
...you're not helping.
"Put the mask on this one."

1020
00:53:26,545 --> 00:53:29,264
Now I'm passed out.
I won't help anybody.

1021
00:53:29,264 --> 00:53:30,279
It's not the point.

1022
00:53:30,353 --> 00:53:32,369
What is the point? Sorry,
I got this wrong.

1023
00:53:32,369 --> 00:53:34,026
What's your point?

1024
00:53:35,249 --> 00:53:38,097
We're not connecting.
It's like you're not present.

1025
00:53:38,097 --> 00:53:40,780
I have been present.
I've been here all day.

1026
00:53:40,944 --> 00:53:42,831
We've been doing things
alongside.

1027
00:53:42,896 --> 00:53:45,514
I'd like for us to do
things together.

1028
00:53:45,808 --> 00:53:48,458
Kate, you're upset
with your family...

1029
00:53:48,527 --> 00:53:50,350
...and you're taking
it out on me.

1030
00:53:50,417 --> 00:53:52,303
They've been
my family for years.

1031
00:53:52,303 --> 00:53:55,151
This is not about my family,
it's about you and me.

1032
00:53:55,279 --> 00:53:56,208
I just...

1033
00:53:57,136 --> 00:53:58,248
I just want something.

1034
00:53:59,183 --> 00:54:01,038
-Merry Christmas.
-Mom!

1035
00:54:01,999 --> 00:54:03,983
-I've missed you!
-Good to see you, Mom!

1036
00:54:03,983 --> 00:54:04,965
It's been so long.

1037
00:54:05,935 --> 00:54:07,823
-And you must be Kate.
-Yes.

1038
00:54:08,686 --> 00:54:10,443
She's a darling.

1039
00:54:10,703 --> 00:54:13,392
-Thanks. Nice to meet you.
-It's wonderful.

1040
00:54:13,392 --> 00:54:15,376
-Should I call you...
-Just call me Paula.

1041
00:54:15,376 --> 00:54:16,358
-Just Paula.
-Okay.

1042
00:54:16,463 --> 00:54:18,405
I'm so glad you came.

1043
00:54:19,247 --> 00:54:21,156
You've been
taking good care of him.

1044
00:54:21,231 --> 00:54:22,990
Hasn't missed
many meals.

1045
00:54:22,990 --> 00:54:24,911
-That's great.
-He likes a snack.

1046
00:54:24,911 --> 00:54:26,830
-I do like the snack.
-Yes, he does.

1047
00:54:26,830 --> 00:54:27,845
Come on in and relax.

1048
00:54:27,918 --> 00:54:30,703
I've fixed all of your
favorite dishes, Bradford.

1049
00:54:30,703 --> 00:54:32,622
Denver and Susan
are watching TV.

1050
00:54:32,622 --> 00:54:34,638
Let's sit here
and catch up for a minute.

1051
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:36,612
-Your house is beautiful.
-Thank you.

1052
00:54:37,327 --> 00:54:38,350
This is gorgeous.

1053
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:40,366
Bradford lived
with me after the divorce.

1054
00:54:40,366 --> 00:54:43,181
Denver and Dallas were
comfortable with Howard.

1055
00:54:43,181 --> 00:54:45,254
But Bradford was
the more sensitive type.

1056
00:54:45,966 --> 00:54:47,918
-I was thinking...
-We're best friends.

1057
00:54:47,918 --> 00:54:48,933
Just inseparable.

1058
00:54:49,838 --> 00:54:51,854
God, he breastfed
until he was five.

1059
00:54:51,854 --> 00:54:53,774
Thought l'd
take him to college.

1060
00:54:53,774 --> 00:54:54,797
Okay, we had enough...

1061
00:54:54,797 --> 00:54:56,717
The only who was
on my tits more...

1062
00:54:56,717 --> 00:54:58,574
...was a professor
that I dated.

1063
00:54:58,574 --> 00:55:00,365
Could you not say "tits"?

1064
00:55:00,365 --> 00:55:03,267
-Hey, kids.
-Okay, this is Darryl.

1065
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,159
Hi, nice to meet you.

1066
00:55:05,229 --> 00:55:07,172
It is so nice to meet you,
young lady.

1067
00:55:09,039 --> 00:55:10,989
And always great
to see you, big guy.

1068
00:55:10,989 --> 00:55:12,931
Hey, how was traffic
getting out here?

1069
00:55:13,069 --> 00:55:16,615
Can I get your gas money?
I'd like to get your gas money.

1070
00:55:16,685 --> 00:55:18,796
Actually, I don't need you
to get my gas money.

1071
00:55:18,796 --> 00:55:20,715
Thank you. I make
more than you do.

1072
00:55:20,715 --> 00:55:23,585
-So, no thank you.
-Bradford, be nice.

1073
00:55:24,523 --> 00:55:25,505
It's okay, sweetie.

1074
00:55:28,428 --> 00:55:29,356
Look...

1075
00:55:30,252 --> 00:55:31,180
...Brad...

1076
00:55:32,172 --> 00:55:34,093
...I'm not trying
to be your father.

1077
00:55:34,093 --> 00:55:35,107
You got one of those.

1078
00:55:36,813 --> 00:55:38,851
I'm just hoping for chance
to be your friend.

1079
00:55:39,820 --> 00:55:42,601
You're my friend, Darryl.
You're my best friend.

1080
00:55:42,795 --> 00:55:44,684
We grew up together,
we rode bikes.

1081
00:55:44,684 --> 00:55:46,604
Used to smell
each other's hands.

1082
00:55:46,604 --> 00:55:49,254
You're sleeping with my mom,
it's weird.

1083
00:55:49,323 --> 00:55:50,371
Can you appreciate that?

1084
00:55:50,444 --> 00:55:53,323
I never had a sexual thought
about her until I was 30.

1085
00:55:53,323 --> 00:55:56,106
Leave it alone.
You can't be my friend anymore.

1086
00:55:56,106 --> 00:55:58,028
You can't be sleeping
with my mom...

1087
00:55:58,028 --> 00:55:59,882
-...and still be my friend.
-Thirsty.

1088
00:55:59,947 --> 00:56:01,867
Kate, what can
I get you to drink?

1089
00:56:01,867 --> 00:56:02,955
-I'm good.
-Your mother...

1090
00:56:02,955 --> 00:56:05,672
-...is a very sexual being.
-She's a very what?

1091
00:56:05,739 --> 00:56:06,794
She's a great lover.

1092
00:56:06,794 --> 00:56:09,547
Say that again
and I'll bust your mouth open.

1093
00:56:09,547 --> 00:56:12,513
Hey, look it. This is Christmas
and we're not gonna go there.

1094
00:56:13,226 --> 00:56:15,338
Kate's been kind enough
to send us some games.

1095
00:56:15,338 --> 00:56:18,239
We're gonna play them
and we'll have fun. Okay?

1096
00:56:26,890 --> 00:56:28,843
Why are you staring
while eating?

1097
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:30,664
That's uncomfortable.

1098
00:56:33,481 --> 00:56:35,306
Don't eat those brownies.

1099
00:56:35,306 --> 00:56:37,247
Those are Grandma's
special brownies.

1100
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:40,330
Kate, could you be a lamb
and explain the rules?

1101
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:43,112
Of course. So, you try to
get your team mate...

1102
00:56:43,177 --> 00:56:44,969
...to say the word
on the top...

1103
00:56:44,969 --> 00:56:46,912
...but can't say any of the
words listed.

1104
00:56:47,049 --> 00:56:48,937
And if you say any
of the words...

1105
00:56:48,937 --> 00:56:50,759
-...then you get buzzed.
-Okay.

1106
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:52,554
That makes sense?

1107
00:56:52,554 --> 00:56:54,729
I'm so excited to have
all here to play this game.

1108
00:56:54,729 --> 00:56:56,425
It's gonna be fun.

1109
00:56:56,425 --> 00:56:58,335
Hey, it's good to have
my friend back.

1110
00:57:00,361 --> 00:57:02,153
So, who wants to go first?

1111
00:57:02,153 --> 00:57:03,114
-I'll go.
-Okay.

1112
00:57:03,114 --> 00:57:05,022
Brad, why don't you
buzz your mom...

1113
00:57:05,097 --> 00:57:07,081
-...and then I'll do the timer.
-Okay.

1114
00:57:07,081 --> 00:57:08,007
Thanks.

1115
00:57:09,929 --> 00:57:11,837
On your mark, get set, go!

1116
00:57:12,905 --> 00:57:15,653
Okay, this is a town in France.

1117
00:57:15,815 --> 00:57:16,777
What?

1118
00:57:16,777 --> 00:57:19,361
-Can't say "France".
-Don't buzz me.

1119
00:57:19,432 --> 00:57:20,585
It's the same
for everybody.

1120
00:57:20,585 --> 00:57:22,373
It's okay.
Do the next card.

1121
00:57:24,297 --> 00:57:25,224
Okay.

1122
00:57:25,415 --> 00:57:27,172
This me, I'm a...

1123
00:57:27,336 --> 00:57:28,295
Cradle robber.

1124
00:57:28,295 --> 00:57:30,118
-What did he say?
-Keep going.

1125
00:57:30,184 --> 00:57:32,038
Don't worry.
You're a therapist. Go.

1126
00:57:32,103 --> 00:57:35,016
-No, not Capricorn but...
-Libra.

1127
00:57:35,016 --> 00:57:35,943
Yes!

1128
00:57:37,704 --> 00:57:38,631
It's fun.

1129
00:57:39,655 --> 00:57:40,584
Okay.

1130
00:57:41,479 --> 00:57:42,624
This is what you dripped
on me.

1131
00:57:43,592 --> 00:57:44,487
Wax!

1132
00:57:44,553 --> 00:57:45,534
No, after that.

1133
00:57:47,240 --> 00:57:48,166
It's brown.

1134
00:57:48,263 --> 00:57:49,351
Make this stop, please.

1135
00:57:49,351 --> 00:57:50,311
Chocolate.

1136
00:57:50,311 --> 00:57:52,166
No, before that!
After the wax!

1137
00:57:53,096 --> 00:57:54,951
-The syrup!
-Yes!

1138
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:57,981
Way sticky,
I wouldn't recommend that.

1139
00:57:58,759 --> 00:57:59,740
-Okay.
-Okay, time.

1140
00:58:00,646 --> 00:58:00,896
Time.

1141
00:58:01,607 --> 00:58:03,548
-Good job. Good job.
-We only got two.

1142
00:58:03,654 --> 00:58:04,670
Who wants to go next?

1143
00:58:04,743 --> 00:58:06,498
-We'll go.
-Okay, great.

1144
00:58:07,462 --> 00:58:08,444
I'll do the buzzer.

1145
00:58:10,342 --> 00:58:12,285
Are you gonna eat
while you play that?

1146
00:58:13,192 --> 00:58:14,311
-Flip the tube.
-Excuse me?

1147
00:58:14,311 --> 00:58:15,260
Flip the tube.

1148
00:58:16,136 --> 00:58:18,044
Okay. On your mark,
get set, go!

1149
00:58:19,015 --> 00:58:20,870
-Capital of China.
-Hong Kong.

1150
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:21,798
Yes.

1151
00:58:21,863 --> 00:58:23,836
Thing next to your bed
on the night stand.

1152
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:24,804
-A sock.
-Yes.

1153
00:58:26,534 --> 00:58:28,580
Helped you come up
with this, you're drunk...

1154
00:58:28,580 --> 00:58:30,589
...and came home from
the bar last Thursday.

1155
00:58:31,397 --> 00:58:32,325
-Alibi.
-Yes.

1156
00:58:33,286 --> 00:58:35,424
The thing I'm not
allowed to wear to Supercross.

1157
00:58:36,135 --> 00:58:37,082
-Mini skirt.
-Yes!

1158
00:58:38,054 --> 00:58:39,963
Me and you dry humping
on the beach.

1159
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,046
-A screensaver.
-Yes, baby!

1160
00:58:42,150 --> 00:58:43,840
This game is so easy.

1161
00:58:43,941 --> 00:58:46,843
The only man I'm allowed
to cheat on you with.

1162
00:58:47,813 --> 00:58:48,795
-John Grisham.
-Yes!

1163
00:58:49,574 --> 00:58:52,453
-Mexican dude.
-Ricardo Montealban.

1164
00:58:52,453 --> 00:58:53,381
-Yes!
-Time.

1165
00:58:53,605 --> 00:58:56,256
-Right here. Right here!
-Come on!

1166
00:58:58,276 --> 00:59:00,260
Okay, this is like
an attack video.

1167
00:59:00,260 --> 00:59:02,213
There's other people
uncomfortable.

1168
00:59:02,213 --> 00:59:03,904
Stop. Oh, God.

1169
00:59:04,900 --> 00:59:06,843
You guys got a lot.
How many was that?

1170
00:59:06,981 --> 00:59:07,941
-Seven.
-Seven.

1171
00:59:07,941 --> 00:59:09,762
-Can you do the buzzer?
-Yeah!

1172
00:59:09,893 --> 00:59:11,748
We can do this, baby.
You ready?

1173
00:59:11,748 --> 00:59:12,708
Yeah.

1174
00:59:12,708 --> 00:59:14,532
Let's light a fire.

1175
00:59:14,532 --> 00:59:16,387
-Ready? Go!
-Okay.

1176
00:59:16,548 --> 00:59:18,435
The thing
I'm most scared of.

1177
00:59:18,435 --> 00:59:19,459
-Snakes.
-No, no.

1178
00:59:19,459 --> 00:59:22,308
-Thing I'm most scared of.
-Jump-jumps! 4 year-olds.

1179
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:24,249
This scares me to my core.

1180
00:59:24,323 --> 00:59:26,974
Come up with something.
Use a lifeline.

1181
00:59:27,107 --> 00:59:28,963
Spiders.
I'm scared of spiders.

1182
00:59:29,028 --> 00:59:30,949
You don't have to say
the answer.

1183
00:59:30,949 --> 00:59:34,592
You can say "eight-legged
animal" or "superhero"...

1184
00:59:34,659 --> 00:59:36,772
-Can't say superhero!
-Mom, I'm not the one...

1185
00:59:36,772 --> 00:59:37,699
Try again.

1186
00:59:38,595 --> 00:59:41,311
In high-school,
my senior year spring break...

1187
00:59:41,379 --> 00:59:44,323
...I was in Cancun,
wearing this bikini top...

1188
00:59:44,323 --> 00:59:46,265
-Tourists. Skinny.
-No, no, no.

1189
00:59:46,338 --> 00:59:48,163
-Thin?
-No, at the bar.

1190
00:59:48,163 --> 00:59:50,051
-I was shaking around...
-Dancer.

1191
00:59:50,051 --> 00:59:52,066
-My stuff fell out.
-Your what fell out?

1192
00:59:52,066 --> 00:59:53,091
My stuff fell out.

1193
00:59:53,091 --> 00:59:55,747
Everybody said
when I went to the bar:

1194
00:59:55,747 --> 00:59:56,729
"Oh, here comes..."

1195
00:59:59,811 --> 01:00:00,758
Peek-a-boo.

1196
01:00:02,595 --> 01:00:03,554
Peek-a-boo.

1197
01:00:03,554 --> 01:00:06,338
Okay, honey, you can say,
like, "look" or...

1198
01:00:06,338 --> 01:00:08,354
-Can't say "look".
-I don't have the card.

1199
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:10,370
I'm giving examples.
I have a thing here.

1200
01:00:10,370 --> 01:00:12,093
-See...
-Can't say "see"!

1201
01:00:12,161 --> 01:00:13,250
I'm explaining
the game.

1202
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:14,875
Can't say "game"!

1203
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:17,050
Mom, the answer's been said.
She said the answer.

1204
01:00:17,793 --> 01:00:18,944
-Let's do the next one.
-Okay.

1205
01:00:18,944 --> 01:00:20,802
-Let's... you know?
-I get it.

1206
01:00:20,802 --> 01:00:23,704
Okay, this is something
you would eat...

1207
01:00:24,546 --> 01:00:26,562
-...you put it on a barbecue.
-Chicken.

1208
01:00:26,562 --> 01:00:27,544
-My favorite.
-Beef.

1209
01:00:27,617 --> 01:00:28,610
Can't say "beef"!

1210
01:00:28,610 --> 01:00:30,366
I'm not saying the things!

1211
01:00:30,433 --> 01:00:33,217
-Get that? Just shush.
-Can't say "shush."

1212
01:00:33,217 --> 01:00:34,297
Okay, Mom,
I can say "shush."

1213
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:36,191
-You can't say "shush."
-Kebab.

1214
01:00:37,057 --> 01:00:38,004
It's kebab.

1215
01:00:38,111 --> 01:00:39,970
It says I can't say "shish"!

1216
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:42,009
Shish. Shish. Shish.

1217
01:00:42,720 --> 01:00:43,800
I'd say it,
I don't have it.

1218
01:00:43,872 --> 01:00:46,689
There's this thing
so that I can't see what it is.

1219
01:00:46,689 --> 01:00:48,478
Let's just move on.

1220
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:50,528
Our time's up.

1221
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,336
What's this attitude?

1222
01:00:54,336 --> 01:00:56,224
I don't have any.
I've shut down.

1223
01:00:56,224 --> 01:00:58,272
She buzzes me,
I'm trying to explain to you...

1224
01:00:58,272 --> 01:01:00,224
...how to play the game,
you don't get...

1225
01:01:00,224 --> 01:01:02,908
...the best ways to play
and I'm shutting down.

1226
01:01:20,192 --> 01:01:22,102
I wanna talk to you
about something.

1227
01:01:23,168 --> 01:01:25,119
I know what you want
to talk about.

1228
01:01:25,119 --> 01:01:26,079
You do?

1229
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:28,763
I don't want you to apologize
because love...

1230
01:01:28,832 --> 01:01:31,613
...means never having to say
"I'm sorry." You know?

1231
01:01:31,679 --> 01:01:33,500
For the record,
I do forgive you.

1232
01:01:33,758 --> 01:01:35,613
When you're
playing board games...

1233
01:01:35,743 --> 01:01:39,328
...you shouldn't go so
conceptual, go more literal.

1234
01:01:39,328 --> 01:01:40,407
-How else will...?
-No, Brad.

1235
01:01:40,479 --> 01:01:42,334
I took a pregnancy test today.

1236
01:01:43,295 --> 01:01:44,276
You took what?

1237
01:01:45,182 --> 01:01:47,037
I took a pregnancy test today.

1238
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:50,013
At my mom's.
It was in my sister's bag...

1239
01:01:50,013 --> 01:01:51,868
...I was in the bathroom,
I was late...

1240
01:01:51,933 --> 01:01:54,718
...and I thought I should
probably take a test.

1241
01:01:54,718 --> 01:01:56,734
-Honey, you pulled the goalie?
-What?

1242
01:01:56,734 --> 01:01:58,717
Can't pull the goalie
without checking.

1243
01:01:58,717 --> 01:02:01,564
I did not. That's not
what this conversation is about.

1244
01:02:01,628 --> 01:02:03,517
What?
What am I missing here?

1245
01:02:04,222 --> 01:02:06,398
Relax, Brad. It was negative.
I'm not pregnant.

1246
01:02:06,398 --> 01:02:09,246
Why don't you just hit
me with that from the start?

1247
01:02:09,246 --> 01:02:12,158
Instead of making me take laps
around the anxiety pool.

1248
01:02:12,158 --> 01:02:13,918
What is this reaction?

1249
01:02:13,918 --> 01:02:15,804
If there's one thing
we've learned...

1250
01:02:15,869 --> 01:02:17,692
...from being
around our families...

1251
01:02:17,757 --> 01:02:19,731
...it's of the dangers
of procreating.

1252
01:02:20,670 --> 01:02:22,652
That's not the things
we want in life.

1253
01:02:22,652 --> 01:02:24,509
Brad, I realized it today.

1254
01:02:24,509 --> 01:02:26,297
I thought
I'd always known...

1255
01:02:26,364 --> 01:02:28,380
...I didn't want to have kids.
Took this test...

1256
01:02:28,380 --> 01:02:30,366
...I'm waiting for
positive or negative...

1257
01:02:30,366 --> 01:02:32,275
...and I thought...
I felt...

1258
01:02:33,116 --> 01:02:35,931
...different. You know?
I felt hopeful.

1259
01:02:36,092 --> 01:02:37,853
Maybe it would happen...

1260
01:02:37,853 --> 01:02:40,755
...and we'd be forced
to get over our fears.

1261
01:02:41,628 --> 01:02:42,812
We've spent so much time...

1262
01:02:42,812 --> 01:02:45,531
...creating these boundaries
and making sure...

1263
01:02:45,531 --> 01:02:47,612
...we don't limit ourselves
with responsibility...

1264
01:02:47,612 --> 01:02:50,262
...and I don't wanna
live like that anymore.

1265
01:02:50,331 --> 01:02:51,412
That's not loving at all.

1266
01:02:52,349 --> 01:02:54,235
-ls that an eighties song?
-No, Brad.

1267
01:02:54,299 --> 01:02:57,116
-An eighties song?
-I'm tired of being one foot in.

1268
01:02:57,116 --> 01:02:59,025
I want us to be open,
love each other...

1269
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:01,051
...however it's going to be.
If it means...

1270
01:03:01,051 --> 01:03:03,004
...we get married or
if we have kids...

1271
01:03:03,004 --> 01:03:05,851
...I feel like that's okay.
I wanna be in a relationship...

1272
01:03:06,652 --> 01:03:08,506
...that goes
where it needs to go.

1273
01:03:08,668 --> 01:03:11,483
Okay. I'd like the relationship
to go to Fiji.

1274
01:03:11,483 --> 01:03:14,483
Brad, this is very important.
I wanna have this conversation.

1275
01:03:15,194 --> 01:03:17,307
I don't want to.
I don't wanna have it.

1276
01:03:17,307 --> 01:03:19,290
I feel the same
when we first met.

1277
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:20,981
I've been honest.

1278
01:03:21,050 --> 01:03:23,003
I don't want a conversation
about it...

1279
01:03:23,003 --> 01:03:24,890
...because I don't want
those things.

1280
01:03:29,819 --> 01:03:30,746
Okay.

1281
01:03:57,593 --> 01:03:59,382
You don't have
to come in.

1282
01:04:01,467 --> 01:04:04,085
I'm not going
to let you go in yourself.

1283
01:04:04,154 --> 01:04:06,007
I'll have my sister
drive me back.

1284
01:04:06,072 --> 01:04:07,962
We'll go
and I'll drive you home.

1285
01:04:07,962 --> 01:04:09,073
I'm not gonna go
and pretend...

1286
01:04:09,145 --> 01:04:11,927
...we're something we're not.
I can't do that anymore.

1287
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:13,847
Listen to me, please.

1288
01:04:13,847 --> 01:04:15,801
Let's not overreact to this.

1289
01:04:15,801 --> 01:04:18,551
I'm not overreacting, Brad.
I get it.

1290
01:04:19,449 --> 01:04:20,627
I'm the one changing
the rules.

1291
01:04:21,498 --> 01:04:24,367
If you don't want to change
them with me, I understand.

1292
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:28,056
I just can't do this anymore.

1293
01:04:58,808 --> 01:04:59,736
Honey?

1294
01:04:59,991 --> 01:05:00,918
Coming in?

1295
01:05:03,574 --> 01:05:04,556
Hey, Dad.

1296
01:05:05,623 --> 01:05:06,571
She made it!

1297
01:05:07,479 --> 01:05:09,301
Auntie Kate!
Auntie Kate!

1298
01:05:09,399 --> 01:05:10,487
Merry Christmas again!

1299
01:05:10,487 --> 01:05:12,310
Hi, Kasi.
Merry Christmas.

1300
01:05:12,310 --> 01:05:15,093
Come see the cool stuff
Grandpa Creighton got me!

1301
01:05:15,159 --> 01:05:16,053
Okay.

1302
01:05:17,111 --> 01:05:19,159
Hi, I'm Cheryl,
your dad's girlfriend.

1303
01:05:19,159 --> 01:05:21,777
-Nice to finally meet you.
-Excuse me.

1304
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:23,958
-Hey, Kate!
-Hi, Mom.

1305
01:05:23,958 --> 01:05:26,806
I got a Dora the Explorer
backpack...

1306
01:05:27,798 --> 01:05:31,478
...a matching Dora thermos,
a big girl necklace...

1307
01:05:31,478 --> 01:05:32,564
...and princess shoes!

1308
01:05:32,564 --> 01:05:34,258
Hey, guys!

1309
01:05:34,328 --> 01:05:36,149
Hi, Auntie Kate.
Where's Brad?

1310
01:05:38,294 --> 01:05:41,078
Kasi, why don't you go
tell grandpa thanks...

1311
01:05:41,078 --> 01:05:42,165
...for all your new toys?

1312
01:05:42,165 --> 01:05:44,822
You'd better go or
I'm going to tickle.

1313
01:05:44,822 --> 01:05:45,749
Go!

1314
01:05:48,853 --> 01:05:49,834
This is amazing.

1315
01:05:50,549 --> 01:05:51,695
Dad and Mom
in the same room?

1316
01:05:51,798 --> 01:05:53,488
They hated each other.

1317
01:05:53,557 --> 01:05:57,386
They've been getting together
for stuff since Kasi turned one.

1318
01:06:00,246 --> 01:06:02,101
It must be really nice
for Kasi.

1319
01:06:03,093 --> 01:06:04,948
It's really nice for everyone.

1320
01:06:05,910 --> 01:06:10,868
-Where is Brad?
-He's not going to make it.

1321
01:06:10,868 --> 01:06:12,661
If it's all the same...

1322
01:06:12,661 --> 01:06:14,708
...I'd really just rather
not talk about it.

1323
01:06:14,708 --> 01:06:16,683
-I'm sorry. I didn't realize...
-It's okay.

1324
01:06:17,460 --> 01:06:20,309
It's not something I want
to get into right now.

1325
01:06:20,309 --> 01:06:21,453
We won't talk about him.

1326
01:06:25,204 --> 01:06:27,921
I have a great idea!
Internet dating.

1327
01:06:28,147 --> 01:06:29,164
Do it. It's great.

1328
01:06:29,876 --> 01:06:31,981
You just pay 20 bucks,
you put in your profile.

1329
01:06:32,053 --> 01:06:34,804
Susan, next door, did it.
She found her husband.

1330
01:06:34,804 --> 01:06:35,764
It's great.

1331
01:06:35,764 --> 01:06:37,674
He doesn't have a job,
they're on it.

1332
01:06:37,747 --> 01:06:38,761
You should do it!

1333
01:06:39,540 --> 01:06:41,361
-I'll think about that.
-Yes.

1334
01:06:41,523 --> 01:06:43,312
I'm gonna take a minute.

1335
01:06:43,507 --> 01:06:46,190
Okay. I got your back.
Gotcha.

1336
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:47,347
Thanks.

1337
01:07:11,314 --> 01:07:12,208
Hi, kiddo.

1338
01:07:14,034 --> 01:07:14,982
Hey, Dad.

1339
01:07:18,962 --> 01:07:20,915
Did Brad leave to get
a jumpstart...

1340
01:07:20,915 --> 01:07:22,801
...on inoculating babies
in Burma?

1341
01:07:23,826 --> 01:07:24,786
What?

1342
01:07:24,786 --> 01:07:26,641
Maybe he's making
sock monkeys...

1343
01:07:26,706 --> 01:07:28,494
...for foster kids?

1344
01:07:29,362 --> 01:07:31,402
Or weaving ponchos
for pregnant women...

1345
01:07:31,474 --> 01:07:32,456
...in the Yucatan?

1346
01:07:35,282 --> 01:07:37,201
So, I guess you knew
we were lying?

1347
01:07:37,201 --> 01:07:38,129
Oh, boy.

1348
01:07:39,152 --> 01:07:42,064
Unfortunately, I've had
a lot of experience...

1349
01:07:42,064 --> 01:07:45,743
...bending the truth
to avoid my family.

1350
01:07:46,802 --> 01:07:49,704
And I'll tell you, honey.
I would give anything...

1351
01:07:50,673 --> 01:07:52,528
...to have that time
back again.

1352
01:07:55,377 --> 01:07:56,325
I would too.

1353
01:08:00,208 --> 01:08:02,063
It's taken me a lot of years...

1354
01:08:03,088 --> 01:08:06,023
...and several divorces
to learn that...

1355
01:08:07,855 --> 01:08:09,831
...nothing really beats
being honest.

1356
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:14,445
Honest about who you are,
what you need...

1357
01:08:14,608 --> 01:08:17,258
...all the rest tends
to work itself out.

1358
01:08:20,272 --> 01:08:21,221
I was honest...

1359
01:08:22,191 --> 01:08:23,239
...and I think he was too.

1360
01:08:25,199 --> 01:08:27,055
It wasn't
what I wanted to hear.

1361
01:08:49,966 --> 01:08:51,119
Cheryl made the dressing...

1362
01:08:51,119 --> 01:08:53,006
...and I did some
of the cooking too.

1363
01:08:53,966 --> 01:08:55,886
I put the ice cubes
in the glasses...

1364
01:08:55,886 --> 01:08:57,709
...and salt
in the saltshakers.

1365
01:08:57,839 --> 01:08:59,464
All right, well.

1366
01:09:02,349 --> 01:09:04,358
Not long ago, I wouldn't
have been able...

1367
01:09:04,464 --> 01:09:06,372
...to put this group
of people together...

1368
01:09:06,446 --> 01:09:08,202
...in my wildest imagination.

1369
01:09:09,165 --> 01:09:11,075
The changes we've all
been through...

1370
01:09:11,949 --> 01:09:13,988
...the little hurts
we've given each other...

1371
01:09:14,894 --> 01:09:16,835
...we hope we're forgiven
for them.

1372
01:09:17,870 --> 01:09:19,724
We thank you, dear Lord...

1373
01:09:20,589 --> 01:09:24,418
...because there's nothing
more important than family.

1374
01:09:26,381 --> 01:09:27,308
-Amen.
-Amen.

1375
01:09:27,468 --> 01:09:28,396
Amen.

1376
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:48,612
What the hell
do you want?

1377
01:09:50,380 --> 01:09:51,460
You forgot your tampons?

1378
01:09:56,173 --> 01:09:57,961
I didn't forget anything.

1379
01:10:00,076 --> 01:10:01,832
Just came by to see you.

1380
01:10:02,028 --> 01:10:02,955
What for?

1381
01:10:03,020 --> 01:10:05,739
You already destroyed
my TV and family room.

1382
01:10:05,739 --> 01:10:07,788
You want to bust up
my kitchen as well?

1383
01:10:07,788 --> 01:10:09,644
Look, I'm sorry
about that, Dad.

1384
01:10:09,644 --> 01:10:11,531
I didn't mean to do all that.

1385
01:10:11,531 --> 01:10:13,387
Where's tiny?
She didn't come?

1386
01:10:15,339 --> 01:10:16,267
Kate...

1387
01:10:17,419 --> 01:10:19,110
...she's not with me.

1388
01:10:20,171 --> 01:10:22,211
Finally smelled the pathetic
on you, did she?

1389
01:10:22,923 --> 01:10:25,803
No. In fact, she said
she wanted to get...

1390
01:10:25,803 --> 01:10:27,909
...more serious with me.
She said that...

1391
01:10:28,811 --> 01:10:30,636
...you know,
she loved me...

1392
01:10:30,636 --> 01:10:33,546
...wanted to see herself
having a family with me...

1393
01:10:33,546 --> 01:10:34,561
...having kids with me.

1394
01:10:36,522 --> 01:10:39,239
Congratulations. That's what
you wanted to hear?

1395
01:10:40,265 --> 01:10:42,175
-I said no, Dad.
-You what?

1396
01:10:44,970 --> 01:10:46,944
I told her I don't want
to get married.

1397
01:10:49,962 --> 01:10:51,653
Are you shitting me?

1398
01:10:54,634 --> 01:10:56,609
I'll be damned.
I'll be damned.

1399
01:10:56,682 --> 01:10:58,372
That's my boy.

1400
01:10:59,626 --> 01:11:02,375
I always knew you were
the smart one, Lando.

1401
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:06,118
Your mind and spirit
are strong, like mine.

1402
01:11:08,073 --> 01:11:09,065
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

1403
01:11:09,065 --> 01:11:11,847
It's always the one
you fight with the most...

1404
01:11:11,913 --> 01:11:12,993
...who is the most like you.

1405
01:11:15,850 --> 01:11:17,769
Why are we standing
out here for?

1406
01:11:17,769 --> 01:11:19,657
Let's go inside, have a drink.

1407
01:11:19,754 --> 01:11:21,544
Man to man.
Father to son.

1408
01:11:21,544 --> 01:11:23,561
-Right. Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

1409
01:11:23,561 --> 01:11:25,251
You're a big boy now.

1410
01:11:26,217 --> 01:11:27,144
Let's go in.

1411
01:11:28,137 --> 01:11:30,112
Take appraisal of the damage
you've done.

1412
01:11:36,872 --> 01:11:38,759
Would anyone like
anything else?

1413
01:11:38,759 --> 01:11:41,662
-No, no.
-This one's out.

1414
01:11:43,593 --> 01:11:45,448
Dad, can you check
on Jackson?

1415
01:11:45,448 --> 01:11:47,488
-Yeah. The blanket.
-He's got the pillow.

1416
01:11:47,560 --> 01:11:49,250
-This is hers?
-Yeah.

1417
01:13:03,270 --> 01:13:04,196
Hey.

1418
01:13:08,964 --> 01:13:09,893
Okay, listen.

1419
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:13,664
If you get one, get two
because they're like dogs.

1420
01:13:14,565 --> 01:13:16,517
-What are you talking about?
-Kids.

1421
01:13:16,517 --> 01:13:18,590
If you leave one by itself,
you'll never leave.

1422
01:13:18,660 --> 01:13:21,349
You'll feel guilty
being there by itself.

1423
01:13:21,349 --> 01:13:23,454
With two,
they got someone to play with.

1424
01:13:24,165 --> 01:13:25,348
The other big thing
is school.

1425
01:13:25,348 --> 01:13:28,101
A private school?
Then you got sweater vests...

1426
01:13:28,101 --> 01:13:30,980
...and lacrosse coming at you.
But in a public school...

1427
01:13:30,980 --> 01:13:32,989
...there's an older student,
who's hyperactive...

1428
01:13:33,060 --> 01:13:35,939
...hopped up on medication,
and will try to shank the guy.

1429
01:13:35,939 --> 01:13:37,668
That's uncomfortable.

1430
01:13:37,668 --> 01:13:40,708
Are you having this conversation
'cause you're comfortable?

1431
01:13:40,708 --> 01:13:43,460
Or because
you wanna go to Fiji?

1432
01:13:43,460 --> 01:13:44,475
I wanna go to Fiji.

1433
01:13:44,579 --> 01:13:46,371
The tickets are paid for...

1434
01:13:46,371 --> 01:13:48,323
...and hotel rooms
aren't transferable.

1435
01:13:48,323 --> 01:13:52,037
But, honey,
I do feel comfortable now...

1436
01:13:52,037 --> 01:13:54,851
...having this conversation
because in my heart...

1437
01:13:54,916 --> 01:13:56,890
...I know I've found
the one person in life...

1438
01:13:56,963 --> 01:13:59,680
...that I want to have
these conversations with.

1439
01:13:59,779 --> 01:14:00,827
And that person's you.

1440
01:14:01,732 --> 01:14:03,586
-I love you so much.
-Come here.

1441
01:14:09,443 --> 01:14:12,195
This, like, doesn't mean
we're getting married...

1442
01:14:12,195 --> 01:14:14,016
-...or having kids right away.
-No.

1443
01:14:14,081 --> 01:14:16,196
But we should talk,
because these things happen.

1444
01:14:16,196 --> 01:14:19,773
Not that we're planning on it.
We're talking; that happens.

1445
01:14:19,906 --> 01:14:21,956
And if we do have them,
then, you know...

1446
01:14:21,956 --> 01:14:24,834
-...there's a lot of advantages.
-Yeah. They're wonderful.

1447
01:14:24,834 --> 01:14:26,658
They make you feel love.

1448
01:14:26,658 --> 01:14:28,667
Also, they're little
walking tax shelters.

1449
01:14:29,379 --> 01:14:30,557
You can write a lot
of stuff off.

1450
01:14:30,627 --> 01:14:33,212
Yeah, and the yard work.
You save money.

1451
01:14:33,282 --> 01:14:36,130
At a certain age, you can have
them on the lawnmower.

1452
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:38,113
-When they're seven.
-Not slave labor.

1453
01:14:38,113 --> 01:14:40,033
-No, no.
-It's teaching discipline.

1454
01:14:40,033 --> 01:14:42,850
-Chores for money.
-We're not planning the future.

1455
01:14:42,850 --> 01:14:45,793
We would've ended up in a
home playing Bingo in Florida.

1456
01:14:45,793 --> 01:14:46,875
Now we can live
with them.

1457
01:14:47,619 --> 01:14:50,530
-They'll take us in.
-Exciting. I never thought it.

1458
01:14:50,530 --> 01:14:52,417
Feel comfortable
to talk to me...

1459
01:14:52,417 --> 01:14:54,425
...about anything you want
to talk about.

1460
01:14:55,361 --> 01:14:58,208
Unless there's, like,
a playoff game.

1461
01:14:58,305 --> 01:15:00,192
We can find
an appropriate time.

1462
01:15:00,257 --> 01:15:02,973
-I'm kidding. Kind of.
-Okay.

1463
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:04,950
Just to be clear,
this doesn't mean...

1464
01:15:05,025 --> 01:15:06,817
...we're getting married
soon...

1465
01:15:06,817 --> 01:15:08,792
...or having kids right away.
But we're open...

1466
01:15:08,865 --> 01:15:10,808
...to let love grow
where it wants to grow.

1467
01:15:10,882 --> 01:15:13,500
-Exactly.
-We're open to letting it grow.

1468
01:15:13,570 --> 01:15:14,517
Doesn't mean kids.

1469
01:15:17,344 --> 01:15:20,212
-I can't believe we did it.
-We did.

1470
01:15:21,408 --> 01:15:24,160
I don't know what happened,
or the procedure...

1471
01:15:24,160 --> 01:15:26,943
...but here's this beautiful
thing here. You know?

1472
01:15:26,943 --> 01:15:28,992
I did feel
like an air traffic controller.

1473
01:15:28,992 --> 01:15:31,806
Between the huffs,
and the signals and stuff...

1474
01:15:31,871 --> 01:15:33,660
...it just kind of
all happened.

1475
01:15:34,592 --> 01:15:36,501
It's awesome, baby.
You're so awesome.

1476
01:15:36,576 --> 01:15:38,463
You were amazing.
You were like this.

1477
01:15:38,528 --> 01:15:40,511
-Thanks, babe.
-We have a baby!

1478
01:15:40,511 --> 01:15:43,232
-How's she doing?
-Good. Sleeping.

1479
01:15:43,232 --> 01:15:46,143
I just wanted to let you and
our new year's baby know...

1480
01:15:46,143 --> 01:15:48,249
...that you're welcome
to bring family members now.

1481
01:15:48,991 --> 01:15:50,900
-That won't happen.
-No, no family.

1482
01:15:51,967 --> 01:15:53,047
Your families don't know?

1483
01:15:53,759 --> 01:15:56,702
I think they'd be shocked
to hear Kate was pregnant.

1484
01:15:56,702 --> 01:15:58,622
Our families
can be a little much.

1485
01:15:58,622 --> 01:16:01,470
I like to think that we're
keeping it special for us...

1486
01:16:01,535 --> 01:16:03,487
...rather than not
including them.

1487
01:16:03,487 --> 01:16:04,567
Happy New Year, Bay Area!

1488
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,231
We're here live
at Pacific General...

1489
01:16:07,231 --> 01:16:09,247
...where the first baby,
has just been born!

1490
01:16:09,247 --> 01:16:11,962
Let's go say hello
to those lucky parents!

1491
01:16:12,126 --> 01:16:14,015
Congratulations,
McVie family...

1492
01:16:14,015 --> 01:16:16,030
...on having the first baby
of the New Year!

1493
01:16:16,030 --> 01:16:17,720
Dad, how does it feel?

1494
01:16:22,782 --> 01:16:24,440
We're doing great.

1495
01:16:24,637 --> 01:16:28,435
There was... a vacuum.

1496
01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:31,317
And then there was...

1497
01:16:32,317 --> 01:16:35,069
...stretching and juices.

1498
01:16:35,069 --> 01:16:38,045
What he's trying to say is
we're just beyond words excited.

1499
01:16:38,045 --> 01:16:39,988
Oh, goodness.

1500
01:16:43,645 --> 01:16:44,692
I got some in my mouth!

1501
01:16:45,629 --> 01:16:47,636
I can't be around it!
I'm gonna do it too!

1502
01:16:50,448 --> 01:16:57,338
Resync: Xenzai[NEF]

1503
01:17:05,876 --> 01:17:08,128
