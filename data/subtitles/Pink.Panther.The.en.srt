3
00:00:33,117 --> 00:00:36,035
As in every stone of this size,
there is a flaw.

4
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,039
- A flaw?
- The slightest flaw, Your Excellency.

5
00:00:40,124 --> 00:00:41,791
If you look deep into the stone,

6
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,293
you will perceive
the tiniest discoloration.

7
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,046
It resembles an animal.

8
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,091
- An animal?
- A leaping panther.

9
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:54,679
Yes. A pink panther.

10
00:00:58,142 --> 00:00:59,308
Come here, Dala.

11
00:01:05,649 --> 00:01:08,401
A gift for your father
from his grateful people.

12
00:01:08,485 --> 00:01:10,486
Someday it will be yours.

13
00:01:10,612 --> 00:01:13,072
The most fabulous diamond
in all the world.

14
00:01:13,157 --> 00:01:14,741
Come closer.

16
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:09,637
Okay. Thanks a lot, fellas.
Don't forget to take the wardrobe back.

17
00:07:09,721 --> 00:07:11,347
How do you want them,
matte or glossy?

18
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,015
I want it right away.
I'm in a hurry.

19
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,101
You can't rush a genius.

20
00:07:16,019 --> 00:07:17,311
I'll rush.

21
00:07:18,313 --> 00:07:20,439
Don't forget
about the wardrobe.

22
00:07:27,823 --> 00:07:29,615
What you doing?

23
00:07:30,951 --> 00:07:32,952
Where is everybody?

24
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,626
- Come out of there!
- Who is it?

25
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:42,962
Come out,
or we'll bust the door in!

26
00:07:43,046 --> 00:07:45,047
Just a minute.

27
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:48,050
- Can I help you?
- Where is he?

28
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,219
- Where's who?
- George Litton.

29
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,681
He owes me 40 grand,
and nobody welshes on Big Joe.

30
00:07:53,765 --> 00:07:56,851
Look, Big Joe,
I'm not a bill collector.

31
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:59,228
I'm a photographer.
Just took his picture.

32
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:01,522
- What kind of a picture?
- Graduation picture.

33
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:03,566
- His what?
- Graduation.

34
00:08:03,650 --> 00:08:05,442
Get him!

35
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,444
They're worth half a million.
We'll settle for 300,000.

36
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:52,615
I'll do what I can,
but the merchandise is extremely hot.

37
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:15,471
You stay here.
Come with me.

38
00:09:29,027 --> 00:09:30,277
Come on!

39
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:56,011
- Pardon, madame.
- Certainly.

40
00:09:57,514 --> 00:09:59,181
She's gone down.
Come on!

41
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,959
We must find that woman.

42
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,548
What did you say?

43
00:10:32,632 --> 00:10:34,675
We don't have
much of a description.

44
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:40,055
About 5'7", black hair,
wearing a light beige coat.

45
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:43,309
The fools let that fence escape.
He might have talked.

46
00:10:43,393 --> 00:10:45,269
- We will catch him.
- We must.

47
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,770
We must find that woman.

48
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,815
She is our first positive link
with the Phantom.

49
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:55,821
- Yes?
<i>- Your wife to see you, Inspector.</i>

50
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,574
Send her in, please.
Henri, that will be all.

51
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:07,624
- Hello, my darling.
- My angel.

52
00:11:58,343 --> 00:11:59,927
Amber, how are you?

53
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,110
Hello, Duchess.
So glad you could come.

54
00:12:16,194 --> 00:12:18,862
Have fun, children.
How are you?

55
00:12:18,988 --> 00:12:20,906
Hello, darling!

56
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,574
You know Monica?

57
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,411
Of course. You were
simply stunning in your last film.

58
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,874
- What's he say?
- He says hello,

59
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:33,043
and he would like you
to meet his cousin.

60
00:12:35,797 --> 00:12:39,091
- His third cousin.
- That does make a difference.

61
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,932
- Who is that?
- Princess Dala.

62
00:12:48,685 --> 00:12:50,060
Excuse me.

63
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,201
Yes?

64
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:10,038
Miss Angela Dunning.

65
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,921
- Yes?
- Your Highness?

66
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,089
Yes.

67
00:13:20,383 --> 00:13:22,426
Here I am again, Your Highness.

68
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:25,596
I was having a cocktail party,
and I saw you driving by...

69
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:31,226
I just know you'd enjoy it.
Yes, you'd just love it...

70
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:44,698
Your Highness.

71
00:13:46,576 --> 00:13:48,202
Hello there.

72
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:51,079
I can't tell you
what an honor this is.

73
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:53,665
Everyone's just dying to meet you.

74
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,578
- Good morning, Your Highness.
- Good morning.

75
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:15,205
- You're a wonderful skier.
- Thank you.

76
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:16,331
Help!

77
00:15:17,584 --> 00:15:22,129
Somebody's taking my sleigh.
Amber! My dog.

78
00:15:23,131 --> 00:15:24,590
Leave this to me, ma'am.

79
00:15:32,849 --> 00:15:34,850
- What happened?
- I don't know.

80
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:38,979
There was a man with a gun,
and he took the sleigh and Amber.

81
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:50,324
We'll only be here a few days.

82
00:15:50,408 --> 00:15:53,660
It will be a wonderful chance
for a beautiful vacation.

83
00:15:56,581 --> 00:15:58,707
Excuse me.
My leg is caught.

84
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,959
I apologize
for this inconvenience.

85
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:06,089
Do you know who that was?
That was Sir Charles Litton.

86
00:16:06,174 --> 00:16:08,216
- Really?
- Yes.

87
00:16:08,301 --> 00:16:11,428
I am Inspector Clouseau.
This is Madame Clouseau.

88
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:16,933
All right. Thank you.

89
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:23,106
I'm sorry, my darling.

90
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,234
- It's all right, my darling.
- Excuse me.

91
00:16:27,695 --> 00:16:29,780
Do you know that
you're really amazing?

92
00:16:29,864 --> 00:16:31,114
So you've said.

93
00:16:33,618 --> 00:16:36,328
How you can manage
on a police inspector's salary.

94
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,497
How many women could save
enough out of their housekeeping

95
00:16:38,581 --> 00:16:41,291
to buy such a beautiful
mink coat as this?

96
00:16:41,376 --> 00:16:43,126
It's not easy.

97
00:16:43,211 --> 00:16:46,129
You are a constant
and desirable contradiction.

98
00:16:46,214 --> 00:16:48,757
I'm simply
a woman in love, my darling.

99
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:50,092
My darling.

100
00:16:55,682 --> 00:16:58,850
I'm sorry, my darling.
Please excuse me.

101
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:00,185
It's all right.

102
00:17:01,229 --> 00:17:03,814
Did I hurt you?
Are you all right?

103
00:17:03,898 --> 00:17:05,649
- Yes, I'm fine.
- You sure?

104
00:17:05,733 --> 00:17:08,318
- Yes, I am.
- My darling, I'm so sorry.

105
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:14,282
I have a little business
to conclude with the manager.

106
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:15,617
Yes?

107
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:19,746
After which, I'll return
to you immediately.

108
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:21,957
Bye, darling.

109
00:17:35,972 --> 00:17:36,972
It's all right.

110
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:08,170
- How did it go?
- Perfectly.

111
00:18:17,889 --> 00:18:18,930
Come in.

112
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,857
Princess Dala
is concerned about your injuries.

113
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,609
Please thank the princess.

114
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,153
Tell her there's nothing
to be concerned about.

115
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,197
It's really not too serious.

116
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:37,574
In that case, Her Highness
has instructed me

117
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,827
to invite you for dinner
this evening, 8:00 at her chalet.

118
00:18:40,912 --> 00:18:42,871
I'd be delighted to come.

119
00:18:54,550 --> 00:18:57,260
You know Signor Tucker
from Lloyd's of London.

120
00:18:57,345 --> 00:18:58,845
- Hello.
- Hello, old bean.

121
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,806
Your company
insures the Pink Panther.

122
00:19:00,890 --> 00:19:02,182
Yes, for half a million.

123
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,017
- Pounds?
- Sterling.

124
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:06,436
The Phantom could not resist
the Pink Panther.

125
00:19:06,521 --> 00:19:08,647
He will most certainly
make an attempt.

126
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,525
When he does, I shall
be waiting for him. Excuse me.

127
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,193
If I understand your theory,

128
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,778
the Phantom is
one of Miss Dunning's guests.

129
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,655
That is the theory.
I would like to have from you

130
00:19:16,739 --> 00:19:19,699
the names of those guests,
also the location of their rooms.

131
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:21,117
Of course!

132
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:24,120
I assume that the Princess Dala
has the jewel with her.

133
00:19:24,205 --> 00:19:26,665
She'd only tell me
it was in a safe place.

134
00:19:26,749 --> 00:19:29,751
I suppose if it isn't here,
it's at her villa in Rome.

135
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:31,837
My men are watching that villa.

136
00:19:31,921 --> 00:19:34,965
With such planning,
how can the Phantom succeed?

137
00:19:35,091 --> 00:19:38,260
With such planning,
he's succeeded for 20 years.

138
00:19:38,386 --> 00:19:41,763
It's a mistake to underestimate him,
as the inspector can tell you.

139
00:19:41,889 --> 00:19:44,891
The shrewdest, most ingenious
criminal in all the world.

140
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:46,685
- And you have never seen him?
- I've seen him once.

141
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:49,271
Five years ago,
got a fleeting glimpse...

142
00:19:50,273 --> 00:19:51,940
Excuse me.

143
00:19:52,066 --> 00:19:54,192
Got a fleeting glimpse of him
as he made his getaway.

144
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:56,570
In a strange way,
I admire that man.

145
00:19:56,654 --> 00:20:00,740
He has... how would you say...
a unique flair for the dramatic.

146
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:05,412
- He waved good-bye to me.
- Fascinating.

147
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:10,709
But this time, gentlemen,
I shall be waving good-bye to him...

148
00:20:10,793 --> 00:20:13,003
on his way to prison.

149
00:20:14,797 --> 00:20:16,089
Good evening.

150
00:20:19,802 --> 00:20:22,637
Make yourself comfortable.
Her Highness will join you in a moment.

151
00:20:22,722 --> 00:20:25,640
- May I give you a drink?
- I'd like a brandy, thank you.

152
00:20:41,032 --> 00:20:42,198
Your Highness.

153
00:20:42,325 --> 00:20:44,159
Good evening, Sir Charles.

154
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,495
Any news from the police
about your dear little dog?

155
00:20:47,622 --> 00:20:49,915
They expect I'll receive
a ransom note.

156
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:53,043
I am deeply grateful
for what you tried to do.

157
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,502
Ma'am, it was nothing.

158
00:20:55,838 --> 00:20:56,922
Thank you.

159
00:20:57,131 --> 00:20:59,549
- Please sit down.
- Aren't you drinking?

160
00:20:59,634 --> 00:21:01,885
- I don't drink.
- Not ever?

161
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:06,348
I'm quite content with reality.
I have no need for escape.

162
00:21:07,183 --> 00:21:08,475
I enjoy reality
as much as the next man.

163
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,768
In my case, fortunately,

164
00:21:09,852 --> 00:21:12,938
reality includes a good stiff belt
every now and then.

165
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:17,192
- On the other hand, I don't smoke.
- You're right. It's a nasty habit.

166
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,778
Here's to those nasty little habits
that we hold so dear.

167
00:21:20,613 --> 00:21:21,655
<i>L'Chaim.</i>

168
00:21:21,739 --> 00:21:23,782
I beg your pardon?

169
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:27,118
Let's just say
in this case, it means...

170
00:21:27,203 --> 00:21:30,080
your health and thank you
for inviting me to dinner.

171
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:34,292
It's not often I have the chance
to dine alone with a beautiful princess.

172
00:21:34,377 --> 00:21:38,588
I hate to disappoint you,
but I'm afraid this isn't the night.

173
00:21:38,673 --> 00:21:43,718
- But I understood that...
- We're having dinner, but not alone.

174
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,644
At last! Hello!

175
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:55,814
We've been through icicles
up to our you-know-whats!

176
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:58,233
Your Highness!

177
00:21:58,317 --> 00:22:02,988
I think it's too darling of you
to invite me here tonight.

178
00:22:03,072 --> 00:22:05,907
- You've made Cortina for me.
- Hello, lover.

179
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,534
Hello, dear boy.

180
00:22:08,703 --> 00:22:11,079
Don't you move a muscle, darling.

181
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:13,540
Isn't he wonderful, Your Highness?

182
00:22:13,624 --> 00:22:16,501
Such a magnificent sacrifice.

183
00:22:19,839 --> 00:22:20,880
Good evening, sir.

184
00:22:52,705 --> 00:22:54,539
May I have a cigarette,
my darling?

185
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:55,790
Yes, of course, my darling.

186
00:22:58,002 --> 00:23:00,086
- There you are, my love.
- Thank you.

187
00:23:01,964 --> 00:23:03,798
- Yes, sir?
- Scotch on the rocks.

188
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:10,972
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

189
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,974
Thank you very much.

190
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:17,979
I'm looking for my uncle,
Sir Charles Litton.

191
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:21,941
- Darling.
- May I get you some water?

192
00:23:23,652 --> 00:23:27,739
- Hold your hands over your head.
- Yes, my darling. Bend forward.

193
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:30,241
- Darling, I'm sorry.
- Are you all right?

194
00:23:30,326 --> 00:23:32,035
Are you all right, my darling?

195
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:33,870
What?

196
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:36,831
- My darling?
- I'll be right back.

197
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:37,999
Yes, darling.

198
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:49,177
Please.

199
00:23:58,854 --> 00:24:01,564
She's got a cough
in her throat, you know.

200
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:12,367
And what do you think?
She turned out to be a man!

201
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:14,744
It's true! It's quite true!

202
00:24:14,829 --> 00:24:18,164
Your Highness, you really must
let me give you a party.

203
00:24:18,249 --> 00:24:21,835
I can positively guarantee
it'll be a party to end all parties.

204
00:24:21,919 --> 00:24:23,086
I'm sure it will.

205
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:25,088
Perhaps Her Highness
has other plans.

206
00:24:25,214 --> 00:24:29,509
On the contrary. Sounds like fun.
Will you include Sir Charles?

207
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:32,762
No. Charles is
having a fling in Capri.

208
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,264
He has his own parties.

209
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,058
Yes, I've read about
some of his parties.

210
00:24:37,184 --> 00:24:39,811
They're wonderful.
We call him the juggler.

211
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:42,147
I've never really known
a man like him.

212
00:24:42,231 --> 00:24:46,067
He can keep ten girls in the air
at once and make each one happy.

213
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:49,154
Amazing. Sort of
a contemporary Don Juan.

214
00:24:49,238 --> 00:24:50,655
- That's it.
- But there's a difference.

215
00:24:50,739 --> 00:24:54,534
Sir Charles' predecessor was forced
to climb balconies and fight duels,

216
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:58,288
and, as I understand it,
keep his women separate.

217
00:24:58,372 --> 00:25:01,499
Charles, on the other hand,
drives a Ferrari,

218
00:25:01,584 --> 00:25:04,627
enters with a key,
and resorts to collective bargaining.

219
00:25:05,754 --> 00:25:07,672
But they both have
something in common.

220
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:11,676
- What's that, Your Highness?
- Maybe it's best forgotten.

221
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,928
Don't be silly.
Charles doesn't mind.

222
00:25:14,013 --> 00:25:16,347
Everyone takes a potshot
at Charles sooner or later.

223
00:25:16,432 --> 00:25:17,724
Go ahead, ma'am, shoot.

224
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:20,727
It seems to me
any middle-aged bachelor

225
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:24,355
who has never desired
the basic rewards of wife and family

226
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:27,817
and finds it necessary to occupy
the major portion of his life

227
00:25:27,985 --> 00:25:29,944
making one conquest after another

228
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:33,698
is trying to prove something
he can never possibly prove.

229
00:25:33,782 --> 00:25:35,992
- And what's that?
- That he's a man.

230
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:38,411
You're joking!

231
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:41,497
It's somewhat complicated,
but basically sound.

232
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:44,375
- Well, Charles?
- Not very original.

233
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,545
That theory has become
rather a tired Freudian cliché.

234
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:51,132
- But true.
- I've never been on the couch.

235
00:25:51,258 --> 00:25:53,676
Not true.
That's part of your problem.

236
00:25:54,178 --> 00:25:57,639
How refreshing to find royalty
possessed of such a perceptive wit.

237
00:25:57,723 --> 00:26:00,808
Charles, you going
to take that lying down?

238
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,143
Yes, as a matter of fact.

239
00:26:02,228 --> 00:26:05,605
My leg is hurting rather badly.
May I be excused?

240
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,402
- I'll be damned.
- I can't believe it.

241
00:26:12,321 --> 00:26:14,489
- The leg?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

242
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:19,077
That goes to prove
there's a first time for everything.

243
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:20,787
Got a terrific laugh, anyway.

244
00:26:27,670 --> 00:26:28,711
Simone!

245
00:27:38,282 --> 00:27:41,367
Jacques, I'm still cold.

246
00:27:41,452 --> 00:27:43,619
Perhaps another blanket,
my darling.

247
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:47,206
All right, darling.

248
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:24,744
There you are, my darling.

249
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,751
- Yes, darling?
- The light.

250
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,358
- What?
- I'm sorry. It doesn't help.

251
00:28:56,652 --> 00:28:58,903
Perhaps a hot glass of milk.

252
00:29:00,656 --> 00:29:04,992
But I think the room service
has finished, my love.

253
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:07,537
Yes, of course.
I forgot.

254
00:29:07,621 --> 00:29:08,663
You see?

255
00:29:09,623 --> 00:29:11,082
They're all gone now.

256
00:29:12,418 --> 00:29:14,252
Well, no matter.

257
00:29:16,672 --> 00:29:18,673
You see...

258
00:29:20,843 --> 00:29:24,887
If my little pigeon
wants a glass of milk...

259
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:27,014
she shall have one...

260
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:32,728
...even if I have to force them
to open the kitchen.

261
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,859
She shall have milk
wherever she goes, hot or cold.

262
00:29:37,985 --> 00:29:40,486
- Hot.
- I know. That's what I said.

263
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,035
Open the door.

264
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:33,956
Darling, I need to talk to you.

265
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:37,668
I've sent Jacques for some milk.
I only have a moment.

266
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:40,755
- Let's make the most of it.
- No! Stop it.

267
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:43,758
- It was your idea.
- Yes, but you're the wrong...

268
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:47,094
The wrong what? Man?
You think I was...

269
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:50,932
No. I thought you were exactly
who you are, but I'm too impulsive.

270
00:30:51,016 --> 00:30:52,725
This is not the right way.

271
00:30:54,061 --> 00:30:55,269
Another time.

272
00:31:33,141 --> 00:31:35,851
- Here you are, my beloved.
- Thank you.

273
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:39,146
It's all they had.

274
00:31:39,982 --> 00:31:43,734
Can't get a thing in this hotel.
I had to force them to give me that.

275
00:31:43,819 --> 00:31:44,944
Never mind.

276
00:31:56,790 --> 00:31:59,625
My darling, lovely darling.

277
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,836
What's wrong?

278
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,339
My darling, your feet
are like two icicles.

279
00:32:05,424 --> 00:32:07,592
Have you been out of bed
or something?

280
00:32:07,676 --> 00:32:09,135
No, of course not.

281
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:14,724
Anyway, you warm them on me.

282
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:34,535
This is Princess Dala.
My guests have gone,

283
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:37,538
and I thought perhaps
you would come back and have a drink.

284
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:39,624
I would feel better
if we're friends.

285
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:41,959
I would, too,
and I'd love to come,

286
00:32:42,044 --> 00:32:44,503
but my leg is rather painful.

287
00:32:44,588 --> 00:32:47,048
I'm sorry. Another time.

288
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:49,425
Why don't you come up here?

289
00:32:49,551 --> 00:32:51,594
My leg is only bad
if I walk too much.

290
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:55,139
Maybe you could do the walking
and I could do the drinking.

291
00:32:56,141 --> 00:33:01,187
Unless you think it would be indiscreet
to come to a man's room.

292
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:04,899
I'll be there in five minutes.
Good-bye, Sir Charles.

293
00:33:04,983 --> 00:33:06,067
Good-bye.

294
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:42,603
I don't know what's wrong.
I'm just a bundle of nerves.

295
00:33:42,688 --> 00:33:46,315
Don't worry. We've solved
that problem before.

296
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,150
- You don't mean...
- Of course.

297
00:33:48,276 --> 00:33:51,195
- I don't think you should.
- Don't worry, my darling.

298
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:54,865
- I shall do it ever so softly.
- Jacques, are you sure?

299
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:57,785
My darling, of course.
It's always worked before.

300
00:33:57,911 --> 00:34:00,079
There's no reason
why it should not work now.

301
00:34:00,163 --> 00:34:03,624
You just relax
and leave everything to me.

302
00:34:15,804 --> 00:34:16,804
Jacques?

303
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:21,225
- Yes, my darling?
- I don't think it's such a good idea.

304
00:34:22,978 --> 00:34:24,979
You mean that it's not helping?

305
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:28,983
I'm afraid not.
I think I'll just take a sleeping pill.

306
00:34:30,569 --> 00:34:33,237
Very well, my darling.
I'll get it for you.

307
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:37,616
And why don't you take one yourself?
You need the rest, you know.

308
00:34:39,995 --> 00:34:42,329
Yes, I think perhaps I will.

309
00:35:07,689 --> 00:35:08,981
Here, my darling.

310
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:16,655
- Thank you, my angel.
<i>- Thank you, my angel.</i>

311
00:35:39,888 --> 00:35:41,764
My poor Jacques.

312
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,724
No matter.

313
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:47,061
When you've seen one Stradivarius,
you've seen them all.

314
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:59,240
I hadn't realized it was so late.

315
00:35:59,324 --> 00:36:02,785
Come in, sit down, relax.
Have a nice glass of champagne.

316
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:06,205
- I told you I don't drink.
- Champagne's not drinking.

317
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:09,834
That's the minimum of alcohol
and the maximum of companionship.

318
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,961
It's still against my principles.

319
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,421
That's too bad.
I thought it might break the ice.

320
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:17,383
- You took me to task rather properly.
- No, thank you.

321
00:36:17,467 --> 00:36:19,802
I thought your analysis
was very perceptive.

322
00:36:19,886 --> 00:36:23,013
- But not very polite.
- No, it wasn't.

323
00:36:23,098 --> 00:36:25,558
- What made you do it?
- I resented you.

324
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:29,061
I find it hard to understand
a man of your reputation.

325
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:31,146
We both have reputations.

326
00:36:31,273 --> 00:36:33,858
Perhaps mine is a little more
highly publicized than yours,

327
00:36:33,942 --> 00:36:36,026
but you have presented the press
with a rather definite image.

328
00:36:36,111 --> 00:36:37,236
Yes, I know.

329
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,113
- Are you?
- What?

330
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:42,074
What they call you.
The virgin queen.

331
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,410
I'm not the queen.

332
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:47,997
That's only half an answer.

333
00:36:48,123 --> 00:36:51,834
The strong-willed ruler of ten million
people sitting in her ivory tower,

334
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:55,629
untouched, unwed,
and unapproachable.

335
00:36:56,298 --> 00:37:00,384
If you had known my father,
you would understand me.

336
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,595
He was an absolute ruler.

337
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:04,972
He governed his people
with an iron hand,

338
00:37:05,098 --> 00:37:08,309
but he gave me a white pony
for my fifth birthday.

339
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:10,728
He was wrong about many things,

340
00:37:10,812 --> 00:37:14,565
but he made his decisions according
to the ways of his predecessors.

341
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:18,736
I learned the way of the West,
so I've become a little of both...

342
00:37:18,862 --> 00:37:20,321
a paradox...

343
00:37:20,447 --> 00:37:23,908
and it is hard
to reconcile the extremes.

344
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:27,620
Have a glass of champagne.
Does wonders for extremes.

345
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:30,956
It's been known to launch
some lasting friendships.

346
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,713
- Don't you trust me?
- No.

347
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:41,091
- Are you afraid?
- No.

348
00:37:42,719 --> 00:37:44,345
<i>L'Chaim.</i>

349
00:37:53,355 --> 00:37:57,650
I was three years old
when I rode my first elephant.

350
00:37:57,734 --> 00:38:02,905
I was six when I went
on my first "safrari."

351
00:38:05,033 --> 00:38:07,409
"Frasari."

352
00:38:07,494 --> 00:38:09,828
Wild-animal hunt.

353
00:38:09,913 --> 00:38:13,624
And I was ten
when I bagged my first tiger.

354
00:38:13,708 --> 00:38:17,503
But I'll never forget
my lovely little pony.

355
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:19,421
When did you bag him?

356
00:38:20,507 --> 00:38:24,718
You're making fun again.
You really don't like animals.

357
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:28,097
Don't trust a man
who doesn't care about animals.

358
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:34,103
And don't trust an animal
who doesn't care about people.

359
00:38:36,523 --> 00:38:38,524
Why you don't like people?

360
00:38:38,608 --> 00:38:40,401
I like people.

361
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:46,699
That's supposed to be me
who doesn't...

362
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:49,410
like people, right?

363
00:38:49,536 --> 00:38:51,412
If you say so.

364
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:55,958
I don't say so.
You say so.

365
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,876
- Right?
- I said so.

366
00:38:57,961 --> 00:39:01,588
And another thing you did,
you didn't tell me the truth.

367
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:06,427
- About what?
- About champagne. About this.

368
00:39:08,304 --> 00:39:10,431
Boy, did you fib.

369
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:12,850
You said...

370
00:39:14,602 --> 00:39:16,770
Something about extremes.

371
00:39:16,896 --> 00:39:19,440
It does wonders for them.

372
00:39:19,566 --> 00:39:24,111
It does more than that.
It makes your lips numb.

373
00:39:24,237 --> 00:39:28,490
I can't feel them.
Are they still there?

374
00:39:31,119 --> 00:39:33,162
Let's have a look.

375
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:39,209
You didn't tell me about that part.

376
00:39:47,510 --> 00:39:50,471
Won't do you any good.
I can't feel it.

377
00:39:54,976 --> 00:39:58,103
Hoisted on your own petard.

378
00:39:59,773 --> 00:40:03,317
Don't try to say that
when you haven't got any lips.

379
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:11,158
I'm plastered.

380
00:40:12,535 --> 00:40:15,913
- If that's the right expression.
- That's the right expression.

381
00:40:15,997 --> 00:40:19,583
You're a fraud and a liar.

382
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,712
And you think you are going
to take advantage of me.

383
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,423
<i>No. You think I am.</i>

384
00:40:26,508 --> 00:40:30,385
I know you are.
That's the plan, isn't it?

385
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,514
Feed me champagne...

386
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:35,599
break down the inhibitions...

387
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:36,975
and tallyho.

388
00:40:43,608 --> 00:40:44,691
No more virgin queen.

389
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:49,905
We're all out of champagne.

390
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,157
- I'll get another bottle.
- No!

391
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,328
I prefer to remain conscious

392
00:40:56,412 --> 00:41:00,249
so I may view
the attempted seduction firsthand.

393
00:41:01,543 --> 00:41:04,503
Because you've got
a surprise coming, Charlie.

394
00:41:05,588 --> 00:41:08,048
I got friends in low places.

395
00:41:08,675 --> 00:41:12,386
You make one pass at me,
and I'll sic him on you.

396
00:41:12,512 --> 00:41:14,138
Understand?

397
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:17,766
If he moves a muscle,
attack without mercy.

398
00:41:19,394 --> 00:41:20,894
You see, Charlie?

399
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:25,274
You're outnumbered,
two against one.

400
00:41:25,358 --> 00:41:27,484
And I don't care if you can juggle.

401
00:41:39,956 --> 00:41:42,457
- What?
- I didn't say anything.

402
00:41:43,835 --> 00:41:45,627
Cat got your tongue?

403
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:51,175
Got his tongue?
My friend says he hasn't got it.

404
00:41:51,259 --> 00:41:55,179
Then why don't you
say something?

405
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:57,264
I couldn't think
of anything to say.

406
00:41:59,017 --> 00:42:00,934
Why don't you kiss me again?

407
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:04,938
All right.

408
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:16,992
You know what, Charlie?
I could feel that one.

409
00:42:18,828 --> 00:42:19,995
Again.

410
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:35,427
If I were my father,
I'd have you tortured.

411
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:38,972
No. If you were your father,

412
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:41,225
I doubt very much
if I would have kissed you.

413
00:42:42,310 --> 00:42:44,645
Good thinking, Charlie.

414
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:48,440
Then, now that we've
straightened out who I am,

415
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:50,651
what are you
going to do about it?

416
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:06,416
What kind of a friend are you?
You were supposed to attack.

417
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:12,547
No friends, Charlie.
Now you got me outnumbered.

418
00:43:12,632 --> 00:43:14,132
I thought we were friends.

419
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:18,512
You are the juggler.
I am the virgin queen.

420
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,597
Somebody's got to win.

421
00:43:20,682 --> 00:43:23,684
Friends don't act like that.

422
00:43:23,768 --> 00:43:28,355
Want to be friends, Charlie,
or want to win?

423
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:35,862
You really want to know?

424
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:52,879
What's wrong?

425
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:57,259
I don't feel...
I think I'm going...

426
00:43:57,343 --> 00:43:58,510
Good-bye, Charlie.

427
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:03,932
Here...

428
00:44:11,399 --> 00:44:14,276
Darling. Dala.

429
00:44:16,237 --> 00:44:19,573
Ma'am? Your Highness!

430
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:57,504
Thank you. Up.

431
00:45:59,841 --> 00:46:01,007
There we are.

432
00:46:05,096 --> 00:46:07,097
Hello, Uncle Charles.

433
00:46:08,391 --> 00:46:09,599
George!

434
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:26,450
Good morning.
Listen, what about this nephew?

435
00:46:26,534 --> 00:46:28,452
- How did you find out?
- I met him in the bar last night.

436
00:46:28,536 --> 00:46:30,579
That's what I was trying
to explain at the window.

437
00:46:30,663 --> 00:46:31,663
What happened to you?

438
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:34,291
Jacques dragged me
back to the hotel.

439
00:46:34,375 --> 00:46:37,043
- I looked everywhere for you.
- I looked everywhere for you.

440
00:46:37,128 --> 00:46:39,713
I nearly climbed in bed
with your nephew.

441
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,965
- You what?
- Don't worry. I took care of it.

442
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,384
He had a heavy night.

443
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:46,386
I almost put the princess
in bed with him.

444
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:48,889
- Really?
- What you got there?

445
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:50,807
A note to Uncle Charles.

446
00:46:51,434 --> 00:46:54,227
"Dear Uncle Charles,
don't worry about a thing.

447
00:46:54,312 --> 00:46:57,898
I've gone to see the princess
to apologize for last night."

448
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:00,025
Apologize for what?
Nothing happened.

449
00:47:00,109 --> 00:47:01,902
It must have been
rather embarrassing,

450
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:04,029
expecting to end up
with one man...

451
00:47:04,113 --> 00:47:06,114
She didn't expect
to wind up with anybody.

452
00:47:06,240 --> 00:47:08,366
She had a couple glasses
of champagne and had to rest.

453
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:09,701
Of course.

454
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,536
Think of him
taking over my room.

455
00:47:11,621 --> 00:47:14,664
- Didn't you know he was coming?
- No. I haven't seen him for years.

456
00:47:14,749 --> 00:47:16,124
But who is he?
What is he?

457
00:47:16,209 --> 00:47:18,001
He is my nephew, really.

458
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:20,337
He's my late brother's son.

459
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:24,132
I've been responsible for him
since he was ten years old.

460
00:47:24,217 --> 00:47:26,551
I sent him to all
the best schools in America.

461
00:47:26,636 --> 00:47:28,637
He did very well,
as a matter of fact.

462
00:47:28,763 --> 00:47:31,473
He's just graduated
from college. Look.

463
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:37,187
Isn't he a bit old for school?

464
00:47:37,271 --> 00:47:38,772
He did two years in the army.

465
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:42,859
He lost a whole year after that
to some strange tropical disease.

466
00:47:42,944 --> 00:47:44,819
He's certainly attractive.

467
00:47:44,946 --> 00:47:46,821
There's a slight
family resemblance.

468
00:47:46,948 --> 00:47:48,323
Apart from that,
we have nothing in common.

469
00:47:48,407 --> 00:47:51,535
He's dedicated to education,
passed at the top of his class.

470
00:47:51,619 --> 00:47:52,994
Cares nothing about sports.

471
00:47:53,079 --> 00:47:55,997
In his letters, he's never
once mentioned girls.

472
00:47:56,082 --> 00:47:59,709
He may not mention them, but he's got
a pretty good idea what they are.

473
00:47:59,794 --> 00:48:01,211
I nearly didn't
get out of here last night.

474
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,837
You're joking.

475
00:48:02,964 --> 00:48:05,632
It was a relief to get back
to Jacques and his fiddle.

476
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,134
If we don't do something soon,
he's gonna ruin everything.

477
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:11,555
- If I don't do something.
- It shouldn't be too difficult.

478
00:48:11,639 --> 00:48:14,266
He's just a young man
who's not been out in the world.

479
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:17,477
That's because he's been
spending his time in the bedroom.

480
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:20,647
- I'm surprised at you.
- I can handle it.

481
00:48:20,773 --> 00:48:22,607
As a matter of fact,
it might be rather intriguing,

482
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:26,069
particularly if the family resemblance
goes deeper than you think.

483
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:27,779
I'm envious.

484
00:48:27,863 --> 00:48:30,949
It seems that we're somewhat
in the same spot, my love.

485
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:33,577
You envy George,
and I envy the princess.

486
00:48:36,664 --> 00:48:39,082
I really don't know
what I'm going to do yet.

487
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:42,502
I might go back to college
and get my doctorate.

488
00:48:42,587 --> 00:48:44,588
But I'm torn.

489
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:47,299
I feel there's so many things
to be done in the world,

490
00:48:47,383 --> 00:48:49,718
so many backward countries
where I might be useful.

491
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:52,429
I've even been considering
the Peace Corps.

492
00:48:52,513 --> 00:48:55,098
You're certainly not
much like your uncle.

493
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:57,183
I don't know
too much about my uncle,

494
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:59,102
except what I've read
in newspapers and magazines.

495
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:02,022
- One mustn't judge by that.
- No?

496
00:49:02,106 --> 00:49:05,400
After all, whatever I am today,
he made it possible.

497
00:49:05,526 --> 00:49:08,528
I guess everyone has
at least one redeeming quality.

498
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:09,904
Yes.

499
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:19,039
Good morning, Your Highness.
Hair of the dog.

500
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,458
- May I present Madame Clouseau?
- Good morning.

501
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:23,543
This is my
Americanized nephew George.

502
00:49:23,628 --> 00:49:25,211
We met at the bar last night.

503
00:49:25,338 --> 00:49:27,797
- How is your cough?
- It's completely gone. Thanks.

504
00:49:27,882 --> 00:49:29,215
Have a glass of this.

505
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:31,801
It'll put everything
in its right perspective.

506
00:49:31,886 --> 00:49:33,845
My perspective
is excellent this morning.

507
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:36,181
I see your leg is much better.

508
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:39,100
It's a vast improvement.
Very much better.

509
00:49:39,185 --> 00:49:41,353
George and I had a wonderful
family reunion last night

510
00:49:41,437 --> 00:49:43,104
after we carried you home.

511
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:45,023
- He's quite a lad.
- So I've discovered.

512
00:49:45,107 --> 00:49:46,983
He's thinking ofjoining
the Peace Corps.

513
00:49:47,068 --> 00:49:48,860
Imagine a Litton
in the Peace Corps.

514
00:49:48,944 --> 00:49:50,987
Be careful, or you'll give
your family a good name.

515
00:49:51,072 --> 00:49:53,073
- Please sit down.
- No, thank you.

516
00:49:53,199 --> 00:49:55,408
I was on my way to ski
when I ran into Sir Charles.

517
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:58,953
- Do you ski, Mr. Litton?
- Ski?

518
00:49:59,038 --> 00:50:01,790
- No, not very well.
- You should learn, George.

519
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:04,209
If it wasn't for this ropy leg,
I'd take you myself.

520
00:50:04,293 --> 00:50:05,960
I'm hardly in your uncle's class,

521
00:50:06,045 --> 00:50:08,838
but I'd be happy to give you
the benefit of my experience.

522
00:50:08,923 --> 00:50:11,049
I'm sure Madame
is an excellent teacher.

523
00:50:11,133 --> 00:50:13,385
Certainly she could
get you started out right.

524
00:50:13,469 --> 00:50:15,512
If it wouldn't be
too much trouble, yeah.

525
00:50:15,596 --> 00:50:17,597
Not at all.
It would be a pleasure.

526
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:19,599
Perhaps you'd like
to come along now.

527
00:50:20,059 --> 00:50:22,185
George, you can't pass up
an invitation like that.

528
00:50:22,269 --> 00:50:25,188
I haven't got the proper clothes
and I don't have any skis.

529
00:50:25,272 --> 00:50:28,274
The shop will fix you up.
Just charge everything to me.

530
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:31,611
Thanks. Your Highness,
hope to see you again.

531
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:35,699
If you're back early.
I'm leaving on the afternoon train.

532
00:50:35,783 --> 00:50:37,784
- Have a nice trip.
- Thank you.

533
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:39,494
- Thanks, Uncle Charles.
- Have fun.

534
00:50:42,456 --> 00:50:44,999
Mind the instructor.
She knows what she's doing.

535
00:50:45,126 --> 00:50:46,126
I'm sure she does.

536
00:50:46,252 --> 00:50:48,461
- You're not staying?
- No. We're off to the slopes.

537
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:50,880
I'll get the door.
So long, Uncle Charles.

538
00:50:50,965 --> 00:50:52,590
- Have fun.
- Thanks.

539
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:57,137
Just in time. Thank you.
You sure you won't join me?

540
00:50:57,221 --> 00:50:58,304
Quite sure.

541
00:51:01,434 --> 00:51:03,518
Do you have to
leave this afternoon?

542
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:04,853
Yes.

543
00:51:04,937 --> 00:51:07,063
Isn't this departure
rather sudden?

544
00:51:07,148 --> 00:51:09,566
Not at all.
Why do you think so?

545
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,110
I just thought that
after last night...

546
00:51:12,194 --> 00:51:15,238
My leaving has nothing
to do with last night.

547
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:18,366
- Hasn't it?
- You don't know me very well.

548
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:20,869
No, but I thought last night
I was making some progress.

549
00:51:20,995 --> 00:51:23,496
That was champagne,
nothing more.

550
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:26,416
Whatever it was,
it was very interesting.

551
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:30,003
- I really don't remember.
- That's an awful old cliché.

552
00:51:30,129 --> 00:51:32,213
- It's true.
- The majority of women,

553
00:51:32,298 --> 00:51:35,425
they have half a glass too much
and let down the barriers a little,

554
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:37,635
and they wake up in the morning
riddled with guilt

555
00:51:37,720 --> 00:51:40,722
and think they can reclaim their virtue
by saying, "I don't remember."

556
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:42,932
Are you saying my virtue
is not intact?

557
00:51:43,017 --> 00:51:45,310
- You know it is.
- Then why should I feel guilty?

558
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:47,812
You're not concerned
about what happened.

559
00:51:47,897 --> 00:51:50,106
You're worried about
what might have happened.

560
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:53,234
That makes you vulnerable.
That makes you a woman.

561
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:55,320
You're an arrogant fool.

562
00:51:56,906 --> 00:51:59,407
Perhaps I am,
but after what I just said,

563
00:51:59,533 --> 00:52:01,701
a real woman
would have slapped my face.

564
00:52:12,713 --> 00:52:15,298
I'm glad that's over.
Friends again?

565
00:52:15,382 --> 00:52:17,050
Friends.

566
00:52:17,176 --> 00:52:20,678
Good. Now the least you can do
is let me take you to the station.

567
00:52:20,763 --> 00:52:22,806
- All right.
- You really have to go?

568
00:52:22,890 --> 00:52:24,974
- Yes, I must go.
- That's too bad.

569
00:52:25,059 --> 00:52:28,019
- Nothing I can say to make you stay?
- Nothing.

570
00:52:28,103 --> 00:52:30,396
- What time do you have to be there?
- 3:00.

571
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:34,025
3:00 on the dot,
I'll be here, Your Highness.

572
00:52:36,237 --> 00:52:37,821
3:00.

573
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:49,916
Do we have to start
the lessons right away?

574
00:52:50,042 --> 00:52:52,168
That's what we're up here for,
is it not?

575
00:52:52,253 --> 00:52:56,005
I was hoping we could talk
about last night.

576
00:52:56,090 --> 00:52:59,759
- We can talk about that later.
- You were more fun in bed.

577
00:52:59,844 --> 00:53:01,845
Would you do me a favor,
Mr. Litton?

578
00:53:01,929 --> 00:53:03,096
Sure, if you call me George.

579
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:05,974
Forget about last night.
I was impetuous.

580
00:53:06,100 --> 00:53:09,143
I had too much to drink
and I'd just had a fight with my husband.

581
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:10,645
It might be easier
for you to forget,

582
00:53:10,729 --> 00:53:13,064
but I didn't sleep a wink
after you left.

583
00:53:13,148 --> 00:53:15,358
It was a very frustrating experience.

584
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:18,444
I'm afraid that's your problem,
but I wouldn't make any plans.

585
00:53:18,529 --> 00:53:19,946
I never make any plans.

586
00:53:20,030 --> 00:53:22,949
I just sort of follow my instincts.

587
00:53:23,033 --> 00:53:26,536
George, it's four miles
down the mountain,

588
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:27,912
and I'm a very good skier.

589
00:53:27,997 --> 00:53:29,622
You follow your instincts
too closely,

590
00:53:29,707 --> 00:53:32,000
and you're liable
to break your neck.

591
00:53:32,084 --> 00:53:35,545
The first things to learn about skiing
are the fundamentals.

592
00:53:35,629 --> 00:53:37,297
Let's see you turn around.

593
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:43,970
It's not as easy as it looks.
Let me give you a hand.

594
00:53:45,306 --> 00:53:49,100
Let's try something easier.
It's a lot easier, honest.

595
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:51,394
You were going
to watch those instincts.

596
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:52,979
I'm busy. You watch them.

597
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,355
You're abominable.

598
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:57,150
Yeah, that's me,
the Abominable Snowman.

599
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:59,068
George, stop it!

600
00:54:03,365 --> 00:54:05,366
Imbecile!

601
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:23,301
Perhaps we'll meet again.

602
00:54:23,385 --> 00:54:26,137
- Good-bye, Sir Charles.
- Just a minute.

603
00:54:27,848 --> 00:54:30,433
- That's him. There he goes.
- Who?

604
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:33,019
The man who stole your dog,
in that little car.

605
00:55:23,445 --> 00:55:25,446
- How's it going?
- Fine. I'm going to miss her.

606
00:55:25,531 --> 00:55:28,199
Let that be a lesson.
Never get involved with your victims.

607
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:31,452
- Shall we get out in the open?
- No. It's a bit hard here.

608
00:55:33,872 --> 00:55:38,334
That's good. That's okay.
Right, start. Give it to me now.

609
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:48,511
- How close are they?
- Now.

610
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:50,013
- Sorry. Ready?
- Right.

611
00:55:53,434 --> 00:55:56,686
Come along, little doggy.
Here we are.

612
00:56:00,232 --> 00:56:01,399
Look out!

613
00:56:12,578 --> 00:56:14,996
She's got the dog.
I will see you later.

614
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:48,709
You have a wonderful smile.

615
00:59:48,835 --> 00:59:51,337
I have a great deal
to smile about.

616
00:59:51,463 --> 00:59:54,340
I have Amber back,
and I'm having a wonderful time.

617
00:59:54,466 --> 00:59:55,508
You missed your train.

618
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:58,344
There's one at midnight
and one in the morning.

619
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:01,013
Perhaps I should have
your dog kidnapped again.

620
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,516
Then you'd be bound to stay.

621
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:06,227
Did you arrange to have her
kidnapped the first time?

622
01:00:06,687 --> 01:00:07,853
Of course.

623
01:00:14,152 --> 01:00:16,362
I am willing
to bet you 10,000 francs

624
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:19,824
that the Phantom is in Cortina
at this very moment,

625
01:00:19,908 --> 01:00:22,076
even perhaps in this very room.

626
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:24,453
How exciting.
What do you think, Mr. Tucker?

627
01:00:24,538 --> 01:00:26,038
I agree with the inspector.

628
01:00:26,123 --> 01:00:29,458
Ten of his last fifteen victims have been
guests at Angela Dunning's parties.

629
01:00:29,543 --> 01:00:31,460
What are you all talking about?

630
01:00:32,254 --> 01:00:35,256
- The notorious Phantom.
- I've never heard of him.

631
01:00:35,382 --> 01:00:38,718
What little I've read about him,
he seems to be quite a fellow.

632
01:00:38,802 --> 01:00:42,179
There are few thieves who are
as clever as the Phantom.

633
01:00:42,264 --> 01:00:45,099
Each theft is completely
different and unique,

634
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:47,393
classic in its conception.

635
01:00:47,519 --> 01:00:50,771
I thought you were working on
the theory that he does repeat himself.

636
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:53,858
Only as far as Angela Dunning's
parties are concerned.

637
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:56,319
However, there is
one other duplication,

638
01:00:56,403 --> 01:01:00,990
but that is his trademark,
his calling card, so to speak.

639
01:01:01,074 --> 01:01:04,201
He always leaves
a white monogrammed glove.

640
01:01:04,286 --> 01:01:05,995
Sounds terribly theatrical.

641
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:09,832
If I were the Phantom,
I'd have chosen my victim already.

642
01:01:09,916 --> 01:01:12,376
Really? And who would that be?

643
01:01:13,295 --> 01:01:15,755
Who has the most
fabulous diamond in the world?

644
01:01:15,881 --> 01:01:18,924
- I suppose I do.
- Exactly. The Pink Panther.

645
01:01:19,051 --> 01:01:21,177
A prize he could never resist.
He would be bound to try for it.

646
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:22,928
He'd be disappointed.

647
01:01:23,138 --> 01:01:25,306
The Pink Panther
is in my safe at...

648
01:01:25,432 --> 01:01:28,351
Your Highness, please.
Don't say it, not here.

649
01:01:28,435 --> 01:01:30,102
If I'm not being too nosy,
Your Highness,

650
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:32,355
I read somewhere
there was some dispute

651
01:01:32,439 --> 01:01:34,106
over the ownership
of the Pink Panther.

652
01:01:34,232 --> 01:01:36,984
It belongs to me.
It was a gift from my late father.

653
01:01:37,069 --> 01:01:39,320
- I shall never surrender it.
- Why should you?

654
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:41,947
When the present government
seized power,

655
01:01:42,032 --> 01:01:44,909
they claimed the diamond
was the property of the people.

656
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:47,578
There's even talk
of the International Court

657
01:01:47,662 --> 01:01:48,871
deciding the issue.

658
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:52,583
Why don't I steal the diamond
and leave that old glove behind?

659
01:01:52,667 --> 01:01:53,918
You and I
could split the insurance.

660
01:01:54,002 --> 01:01:55,753
All right.

661
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:57,088
I feel like dancing.

662
01:01:57,172 --> 01:01:59,507
- Your Highness?
- I'd love to.

663
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:04,512
- How about you, Madame?
- Yes, of course.

664
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:08,641
- Your leg is better, Sir Charles.
- What?

665
01:02:08,725 --> 01:02:12,561
- I say, your leg is better.
- Yes, much better. Thank you.

666
01:02:13,647 --> 01:02:15,272
You know, Mr. Tucker...

667
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:21,904
- It's my beer, old man.
- My hand. It burnt...

668
01:02:21,988 --> 01:02:23,030
I'm sorry.

669
01:02:27,160 --> 01:02:28,160
Sit down.

670
01:02:32,416 --> 01:02:34,792
Seems to be working out
better than we expected.

671
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:37,002
The only thing we've found out
is that it's not here.

672
01:02:37,129 --> 01:02:40,381
You shouldn't have any trouble
discovering exactly where it is.

673
01:02:40,465 --> 01:02:43,884
Her Highness seems
to be completely captivated.

674
01:02:43,969 --> 01:02:46,470
I'd say that's
a considerable exaggeration.

675
01:02:46,555 --> 01:02:48,639
You're either showing
a touch of senility,

676
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:50,266
or you need glasses, my love.

677
01:02:50,350 --> 01:02:52,351
When I'm showing
my senility, darling,

678
01:02:52,436 --> 01:02:54,770
you'll be occupying your time
with your grandchildren.

679
01:02:54,855 --> 01:02:57,773
One has to have children
before one has grandchildren.

680
01:02:57,858 --> 01:02:59,108
You wouldn't dare.

681
01:02:59,192 --> 01:03:01,318
Jacques would make
a wonderful father.

682
01:03:01,403 --> 01:03:04,196
- He has many redeeming qualities.
- Name one.

683
01:03:04,281 --> 01:03:07,324
He's kind, loyal,
faithful, obedient.

684
01:03:07,409 --> 01:03:09,869
You're either married
to a Boy Scout or a dachshund.

685
01:03:09,953 --> 01:03:11,078
And he adores me.

686
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,206
That eliminates the Boy Scouts.

687
01:03:15,292 --> 01:03:17,334
- Good night.
- Thank you.

688
01:03:25,469 --> 01:03:27,136
You seem to have
lost something.

689
01:03:27,846 --> 01:03:30,931
- How'd you like to borrow mine?
- Thanks, Uncle Charles, yes.

690
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,224
Madame.

691
01:03:40,025 --> 01:03:43,027
- You've been avoiding me.
- That about describes it.

692
01:03:43,111 --> 01:03:44,570
You know what
I've been thinking?

693
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:47,239
Yes. That's why
I've been avoiding you.

694
01:03:47,324 --> 01:03:49,867
I don't think you were really
looking for me that night

695
01:03:49,951 --> 01:03:51,410
in my uncle's bedroom.

696
01:03:51,495 --> 01:03:53,537
- Don't be ridiculous.
- No, I mean it.

697
01:03:53,622 --> 01:03:55,539
Not the way
you treated me today.

698
01:03:55,624 --> 01:03:57,750
- You know what I think?
- What?

699
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:03,255
What do you think, George?

700
01:04:03,340 --> 01:04:06,091
I think maybe I was wrong.

701
01:04:10,764 --> 01:04:12,139
I'm sorry I have to leave,

702
01:04:12,224 --> 01:04:15,142
but I must make
a very important phone call.

703
01:04:15,227 --> 01:04:18,229
- Can't it wait?
- I'm afraid not.

704
01:04:18,313 --> 01:04:19,438
Good night.

705
01:04:33,286 --> 01:04:34,411
That's better.

706
01:04:39,834 --> 01:04:42,670
Just a quick shower, my love,
and I will be right with you.

707
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:08,195
One moment, please.

708
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:16,870
Inspector Clouseau.

709
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:20,082
Inspector Clouseau,
this is the prefect of police.

710
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:22,293
I have information
regarding the Phantom.

711
01:05:22,377 --> 01:05:24,169
- The Phantom?
- Yes. You must come at once.

712
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:25,296
I'm in Brunico.

713
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:29,174
Brunico? But that's in Brunico.
That's 30 miles from here.

714
01:05:29,301 --> 01:05:31,594
It is here that I have
discovered the information.

715
01:05:31,678 --> 01:05:32,928
Come immediately.

716
01:05:33,013 --> 01:05:35,097
I cannot say more.
I am being watched.

717
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:38,684
Yes. I understand, yes.

718
01:05:41,062 --> 01:05:44,148
I'm sorry, my darling.
Important police business.

719
01:05:44,232 --> 01:05:46,609
I will be back with you
as soon as possible.

720
01:05:46,693 --> 01:05:48,527
I understand, my love.

721
01:05:49,487 --> 01:05:51,196
- My darling.
- Yes?

722
01:05:51,740 --> 01:05:55,868
I am a husband that must be
envied by all other husbands.

723
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:58,787
I'm sure no one
ever had a husband like you.

724
01:05:58,872 --> 01:05:59,913
My darling.

725
01:06:04,044 --> 01:06:06,378
My darling, don't move.
Don't panic.

726
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:08,714
All that has happened
is that my hat has caught

727
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:12,301
in one of your naughty
little hairpins.

728
01:06:12,385 --> 01:06:13,636
Voilà.

729
01:06:19,726 --> 01:06:25,689
You know, at times like this
I wish I was but a simple peasant.

730
01:06:25,774 --> 01:06:30,235
It's times like this that make me
realize how lucky I really am.

731
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:04,436
He's gone to Brunico.
Another call about the Phantom.

732
01:07:06,356 --> 01:07:08,774
There's something going on.

733
01:07:08,858 --> 01:07:12,027
I don't quite know what it is,
but there's something wrong.

734
01:07:12,112 --> 01:07:13,570
Do you want to call it off?

735
01:07:13,655 --> 01:07:15,489
I don't know.
I'm considering it.

736
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:16,865
Have you considered
something else?

737
01:07:16,950 --> 01:07:18,158
What's that?

738
01:07:18,284 --> 01:07:20,661
The possibility that
you're growing a conscience.

739
01:07:20,787 --> 01:07:23,497
- A conscience? About what?
- The princess.

740
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:27,710
- You're being ridiculous.
- No, I'm just being a woman.

741
01:07:27,794 --> 01:07:31,422
This time you've chosen
a fascinating victim.

742
01:07:31,506 --> 01:07:33,549
I suspect you've broken
the first rule

743
01:07:33,633 --> 01:07:34,925
and allowed yourself
to become involved.

744
01:07:35,009 --> 01:07:37,386
You're being a woman, all right.

745
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:40,973
That's obvious. Competition
always makes a woman obvious.

746
01:07:42,851 --> 01:07:44,768
- Who is it?
- Bellboy.

747
01:07:48,022 --> 01:07:49,064
Wait a minute.

748
01:07:52,318 --> 01:07:54,403
- What is it?
- Flowers.

749
01:08:05,248 --> 01:08:07,166
- George!
- Trick or treat.

750
01:08:07,250 --> 01:08:10,711
- Wait a minute.
- I found these growing in the hall.

751
01:08:13,631 --> 01:08:15,048
You get right out of here.

752
01:08:15,133 --> 01:08:17,676
What kind of hospitality is that?

753
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:19,803
But my husband
could be back any minute.

754
01:08:19,888 --> 01:08:22,389
He must be about
halfway to Brunico by now.

755
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:24,850
"You must come to Brunico
immediately, Inspector.

756
01:08:24,976 --> 01:08:27,603
I have information
regarding the Phantom."

757
01:08:27,687 --> 01:08:31,356
While you're in Brunico,
waiting for the prefect of police...

758
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:32,858
Thank you very much.

759
01:08:32,984 --> 01:08:35,444
...I shall be investigating your wife.

760
01:08:38,656 --> 01:08:41,158
One never knows, huh?

761
01:08:41,242 --> 01:08:43,744
Perhaps the Phantom
is hiding under the bed.

762
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:46,538
That's more like it.

763
01:08:46,623 --> 01:08:48,916
- You should be ashamed.
- I'm planning on it.

764
01:08:49,000 --> 01:08:50,542
Suppose Jacques
doesn't go to Brunico?

765
01:08:50,627 --> 01:08:52,753
Suppose he finds out
the prefect never called?

766
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:54,254
You must get out of here.

767
01:08:54,339 --> 01:08:56,965
You are the damnedest woman.
Are you a sexual yo-yo?

768
01:08:57,050 --> 01:08:59,259
You jump in my bed,
you push me off a mountain,

769
01:08:59,344 --> 01:09:01,178
then you practically seduce me
on the dance floor.

770
01:09:01,262 --> 01:09:04,765
You're terribly attractive,
and I'm naturally...

771
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:06,850
- But not here.
- Where?

772
01:09:06,935 --> 01:09:08,727
I don't know, but not tonight.

773
01:09:08,812 --> 01:09:11,355
You know what your trouble is?
You can't make up your mind.

774
01:09:11,439 --> 01:09:13,524
- I am married.
- Where's your husband?

775
01:09:13,608 --> 01:09:15,609
Out in 12 feet of snow,
chasing the Phantom.

776
01:09:15,735 --> 01:09:17,277
- That was your idea.
- Sure it was.

777
01:09:17,403 --> 01:09:20,197
If he was any kind of a man,
he wouldn't have gone.

778
01:09:20,740 --> 01:09:22,741
- Darling.
- "Darling"?

779
01:09:25,578 --> 01:09:26,954
It's locked.

780
01:09:32,919 --> 01:09:36,755
There you are.
Halfway to Brunico, huh?

781
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:38,090
Angel?

782
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:46,098
- What do I do?
- Answer the door.

783
01:09:47,100 --> 01:09:49,017
- Simone?
- Yes, dear?

784
01:09:51,437 --> 01:09:55,190
- But I thought you were on...
- That phone call was a ruse.

785
01:09:57,235 --> 01:09:58,902
Are you hurt, my darling?

786
01:10:01,406 --> 01:10:03,365
I don't recall that being there.

787
01:10:03,449 --> 01:10:06,535
No, it was sent a while ago.
I thought it was from you.

788
01:10:06,619 --> 01:10:08,579
No, it certainly was not from me.

789
01:10:10,456 --> 01:10:12,541
Some very strange things
going on here.

790
01:10:14,586 --> 01:10:16,670
I passed the prefect on the road.

791
01:10:18,548 --> 01:10:20,757
- He never made that call.
- No?

792
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:25,470
There was no card with these?

793
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:31,685
Why should anybody want me
to go to Brunico?

794
01:10:33,021 --> 01:10:34,813
My darling.

795
01:10:34,939 --> 01:10:37,649
I'm so sorry.
I was trying to kiss your foot.

796
01:10:37,734 --> 01:10:39,902
- Let me kiss your face.
- It's all right.

797
01:10:39,986 --> 01:10:42,237
Darling, I'm sorry.
Come here.

798
01:10:42,322 --> 01:10:45,616
That's nice and comfy.
You belong in bed there.

799
01:10:46,868 --> 01:10:49,161
- My darling.
- Listen, dear.

800
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:51,580
Why don't we go down to the bar
and have a nightcap?

801
01:10:51,706 --> 01:10:56,460
Darling, listen,
why don't I have a nice bath?

802
01:10:56,544 --> 01:10:59,671
And afterwards,
we have our lovely warm bed.

803
01:10:59,797 --> 01:11:02,424
Don't worry about this mess.
We can have it cleaned up later.

804
01:11:02,508 --> 01:11:04,468
We don't want
any more interruptions.

805
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:06,511
Would you mind if I bathed first?

806
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,265
Did you not bathe earlier?

807
01:11:10,350 --> 01:11:14,811
Yes, but it would warm me up,
help me to relax.

808
01:11:16,648 --> 01:11:18,440
I'll tell you what we'll do.

809
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:20,651
Like we did in the old days,
when you're in there,

810
01:11:20,735 --> 01:11:22,736
I will come in
and scrub your back for you.

811
01:11:22,862 --> 01:11:25,572
You're so romantic,
but I'll only be a moment.

812
01:12:42,942 --> 01:12:44,985
- Darling?
- Yes?

813
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:51,283
- Hello, my darling.
- Hello, my darling.

814
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:54,953
- Why did you draw the curtains?
- Just to keep me warm.

815
01:12:55,038 --> 01:12:58,498
Warm? Warm is one thing.
It must be hell in there.

816
01:12:58,624 --> 01:13:00,834
No, it's wonderful.

817
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,003
Why don't you let me
wash your back for you?

818
01:13:03,129 --> 01:13:04,796
It's already done, my darling.

819
01:13:04,922 --> 01:13:07,799
As I told you before,
I just want to relax.

820
01:13:07,884 --> 01:13:10,135
We must have no secrets
from one another, my darling.

821
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:11,303
I know, my darling.

822
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:17,934
I will brush my teeth
and keep you company.

823
01:13:18,019 --> 01:13:20,145
That's sweet of you, my darling.

824
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:41,291
I thought you would like to know
Princess Dala just checked out.

825
01:13:41,375 --> 01:13:42,667
Thank you very much.

826
01:13:45,838 --> 01:13:49,174
Darling, you got rid of all
those naughty little bubbles?

827
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:51,885
- I beg your pardon?
- You got rid of the little bubbles?

828
01:13:51,969 --> 01:13:53,053
Yes, I did.

829
01:13:57,850 --> 01:13:59,684
Hey, come...

830
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:02,187
Come out quick.

831
01:14:10,446 --> 01:14:12,781
- Who is it?
- Bellboy.

832
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:14,032
One minute.

833
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:19,704
- Inspector's violin, ma'am.
- Thank you.

834
01:14:19,831 --> 01:14:23,125
- Madame, the flowers.
- It's nothing. It doesn't matter.

835
01:14:23,209 --> 01:14:25,418
If they found out downstairs,
I'd lose my job.

836
01:14:25,545 --> 01:14:28,130
- Do it in the morning.
- I'll ring for the maid.

837
01:14:39,767 --> 01:14:41,351
- Darling?
- Yes, dear?

838
01:14:41,435 --> 01:14:42,978
How would you like to
wash my back?

839
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:45,105
I'd love to, but you see...

840
01:14:45,231 --> 01:14:48,358
I have to... I mean...
I'm cold.

841
01:14:54,615 --> 01:14:55,991
Get the broom.

842
01:15:01,622 --> 01:15:04,583
Come on. Hurry up. Go.

843
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:21,183
Shan't be a moment, my darling.
I'll just put on my pajamas.

844
01:15:21,267 --> 01:15:24,644
Darling, look. I think I've got
something in my right eye.

845
01:15:24,729 --> 01:15:27,105
- Let me put you in the...
- My left one. No, this one.

846
01:15:27,190 --> 01:15:30,108
- If you'd come in the light...
- It hurts!

847
01:15:30,193 --> 01:15:33,987
- Stand still. I can't see it.
- It hurts. I cannot open it.

848
01:15:34,113 --> 01:15:35,697
Stand in the light a moment.

849
01:15:35,781 --> 01:15:37,866
- Where?
- Here.

850
01:15:37,950 --> 01:15:40,160
There's absolutely nothing
in your eye.

851
01:15:40,286 --> 01:15:41,745
Nothing? Are you sure?

852
01:15:41,829 --> 01:15:44,122
Only your eye.
That is all that is there.

853
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:57,677
- What are you doing?
- It broke off.

854
01:15:57,762 --> 01:16:00,472
Put it back. We have no time.
He's coming back.

855
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:02,515
Get under the bed.
Come on. Quick.

856
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:05,018
Come on.

857
01:16:08,022 --> 01:16:09,564
Why aren't you in bed,
my darling?

858
01:16:09,649 --> 01:16:13,610
I was... I mean...

859
01:16:13,694 --> 01:16:16,112
I mean, I'm just going to.

860
01:16:18,699 --> 01:16:19,783
I'm cold.

861
01:16:20,660 --> 01:16:24,788
- My Stradivarius.
- The porter just brought it in.

862
01:16:24,872 --> 01:16:28,750
I sent it to the village
to be repaired.

863
01:16:28,834 --> 01:16:30,835
I hope they know how
to fix plastic.

864
01:16:30,920 --> 01:16:32,003
I hope so, too.

865
01:16:33,965 --> 01:16:35,090
So far, so good.

866
01:16:36,550 --> 01:16:37,592
We shall see.

867
01:16:42,807 --> 01:16:43,974
Better than ever.

868
01:16:45,518 --> 01:16:48,228
Dear, I doubt if we shall
need it tonight, my love.

869
01:16:48,354 --> 01:16:50,689
I'm sure we won't, darling.

870
01:17:08,708 --> 01:17:09,708
What is it?

871
01:17:11,419 --> 01:17:12,877
It's very strange.

872
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:27,642
Why don't you come to bed?

873
01:17:29,312 --> 01:17:31,521
You know,
I don't understand this.

874
01:17:32,857 --> 01:17:34,232
You see...

875
01:17:35,526 --> 01:17:38,361
These footprints...

876
01:17:39,572 --> 01:17:43,575
They were made by shoes...

877
01:17:44,702 --> 01:17:49,122
...and they were not
made by my feet.

878
01:17:55,421 --> 01:17:58,256
I'll just get up
and turn off the lights.

879
01:18:02,261 --> 01:18:04,346
At last. At last.

880
01:18:05,264 --> 01:18:07,307
Darling, my little...

881
01:18:10,269 --> 01:18:12,937
Darling? What's the matter,
my darling?

882
01:18:13,064 --> 01:18:17,192
It's very strange, my love,
but suddenly I'm freezing cold.

883
01:18:17,276 --> 01:18:20,862
- You're freezing cold?
- The window is open.

884
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:22,113
The window's open.

885
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:25,450
Sometimes it's healthy
to have fresh air.

886
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:29,454
Healthy is one thing,
but it's hell in here, my love.

887
01:18:29,580 --> 01:18:32,123
Ten below zero outside,
my darling.

888
01:18:36,754 --> 01:18:38,171
That's better.

889
01:18:45,304 --> 01:18:47,305
- There, my darling.
- Yes.

890
01:18:51,644 --> 01:18:53,228
At last!

891
01:19:17,128 --> 01:19:19,170
- Yes?
- I just arrived in town.

892
01:19:19,255 --> 01:19:20,755
No trouble with the police yet.

893
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:24,592
The princess is expecting
important visitors here tomorrow.

894
01:19:24,677 --> 01:19:27,512
- She say anything about leaving?
- Who is this?

895
01:19:40,568 --> 01:19:43,111
- Yes?
<i>- Princess Dala, please.</i>

896
01:19:43,195 --> 01:19:45,780
<i>Her Highness checked out</i>
<i>a short while ago.</i>

897
01:20:59,772 --> 01:21:01,731
Uncle Charles.

898
01:21:38,352 --> 01:21:40,144
What did you say?

899
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:42,313
I said he could come
as one of the Borgias.

900
01:21:42,398 --> 01:21:44,065
Then he wouldn't
have to explain his cousin.

901
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:45,149
What's a Borgia?

902
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:50,363
Good evening.

903
01:21:59,665 --> 01:22:01,583
I mean...

904
01:22:01,667 --> 01:22:05,336
I enjoy champagne in bed
as much as the next man,

905
01:22:06,672 --> 01:22:09,591
but from now on, perhaps
a more practical approach?

906
01:22:09,717 --> 01:22:13,386
I'm sorry, my darling.
I wanted to surprise you.

907
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:17,432
- It's been a night of surprises.
- You can say that again.

908
01:22:17,516 --> 01:22:18,933
It's been...

909
01:22:21,061 --> 01:22:23,021
Anyway...

910
01:22:23,272 --> 01:22:25,356
- My love?
- Yes?

911
01:22:27,943 --> 01:22:29,986
Shall I say you're not here?

912
01:22:31,030 --> 01:22:33,323
No, it's all right, darling.
I'll answer it.

913
01:22:42,291 --> 01:22:45,251
- Yes!
- Tucker here, Inspector.

914
01:22:45,544 --> 01:22:48,963
The man who kidnapped
the dog was driving a rented car.

915
01:22:49,173 --> 01:22:51,633
He's been identified
as a man named Artoff.

916
01:22:51,717 --> 01:22:54,093
London informs us
that a man of his description

917
01:22:54,803 --> 01:22:57,597
is at present employed
by Sir Charles Litton.

918
01:22:57,973 --> 01:23:00,016
I see. Come up immediately.

919
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:01,225
Sir Charles!

920
01:23:01,352 --> 01:23:04,562
He's the Phantom!
I've really got him this time.

921
01:23:18,786 --> 01:23:21,454
Sir Charles?
Open that door.

922
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:23,331
I know you're in there.

923
01:23:23,916 --> 01:23:25,917
Open up. This is the police.

924
01:23:26,585 --> 01:23:29,587
- Stand back while I fire.
- No, don't do that, old man.

925
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,687
- Jacques knows.
- And somebody else.

926
01:23:46,063 --> 01:23:48,314
George has got
my do-it-yourself Phantom kit.

927
01:23:48,816 --> 01:23:50,483
I've got to get out of here.

928
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:55,321
- His clothes are still here.
- Perhaps he's already escaped.

929
01:23:55,614 --> 01:23:58,032
Most unlikely. He doesn't realize
that I am onto him.

930
01:23:58,117 --> 01:23:59,450
Listen, old man.

931
01:23:59,743 --> 01:24:03,371
We've no proof that Artoff was
the man driving the Innocente.

932
01:24:03,455 --> 01:24:06,708
Sir Charles is our man.
My every instinct tells me so.

933
01:24:06,917 --> 01:24:08,459
Careful, you fool.
You realize this gun is loaded?

934
01:24:08,794 --> 01:24:12,296
What I must do now is get dressed
and search the rest of the hotel.

935
01:24:19,805 --> 01:24:21,806
- Did you find him?
- No, but he can't be far.

936
01:24:22,099 --> 01:24:24,183
I must dress quickly and get...

937
01:24:28,188 --> 01:24:29,897
- It's gone.
- What's gone?

938
01:24:30,274 --> 01:24:31,399
My coat!

939
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:34,152
My Sûreté Scotland-Yard-type
Macintosh! It's gone!

940
01:24:34,236 --> 01:24:36,279
Good evening, Inspector.

941
01:25:14,443 --> 01:25:17,528
- What is it, Saloud?
- Inspector Clouseau.

942
01:25:20,824 --> 01:25:23,117
Your Highness,
please excuse this interruption.

943
01:25:23,202 --> 01:25:24,952
I have news
of great importance.

944
01:25:25,037 --> 01:25:27,371
This is Mr. Tucker
of Lloyd's of London.

945
01:25:27,623 --> 01:25:29,707
And we have met before.

946
01:25:30,793 --> 01:25:32,502
I've met her, too, you know.

947
01:25:32,586 --> 01:25:34,337
Yes, I know, but we are
meeting her again now.

948
01:25:34,421 --> 01:25:36,422
What is this news?

949
01:25:36,590 --> 01:25:39,759
I have discovered
the identity of the Phantom.

950
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,969
- You don't say.
- I do say.

951
01:25:42,221 --> 01:25:43,930
- Of course, we're not positive.
- I am positive.

952
01:25:44,056 --> 01:25:45,932
He is, I believe, at this
very moment here in Rome.

953
01:25:46,058 --> 01:25:48,100
- Really?
- Yes.

954
01:25:48,185 --> 01:25:50,561
Have you seen or heard
from Sir Charles Litton?

955
01:25:50,646 --> 01:25:53,481
Not since I left Cortina. Why?

956
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:56,275
Sir Charles and the Phantom
are one and the same.

957
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:58,903
- You're not serious.
- I am serious.

958
01:25:59,112 --> 01:26:00,404
I can understand
how difficult it is

959
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:03,241
for Your Highness
to accept the facts.

960
01:26:03,367 --> 01:26:06,536
Sir Charles is a very persuasive
and attractive man.

961
01:26:06,703 --> 01:26:08,371
He is also Sir Charles Litton,

962
01:26:08,705 --> 01:26:11,290
a man of considerable influence
and reputation.

963
01:26:11,583 --> 01:26:12,917
She's got quite a point there.

964
01:26:13,043 --> 01:26:15,753
He is a fraud,
and I shall prove it.

965
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:17,922
Meanwhile,
I would like your permission

966
01:26:18,131 --> 01:26:19,549
to surround the house
with armed guards.

967
01:26:19,633 --> 01:26:22,343
- I take it the gem is in the villa.
- It is.

968
01:26:22,594 --> 01:26:25,555
As you know, I'm having
a rather large party this evening.

969
01:26:25,889 --> 01:26:28,975
Your guests will be caused
no embarrassment whatsoever.

970
01:26:29,059 --> 01:26:32,770
They will not be aware my men
are present in their disguises.

971
01:26:33,021 --> 01:26:34,605
In that case,
you have my permission.

972
01:26:34,815 --> 01:26:35,940
Thank you.

973
01:26:48,287 --> 01:26:50,788
Your Highness, mark my words,

974
01:26:51,081 --> 01:26:53,207
if Sir Charles is foolish enough

975
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:55,877
to attempt to steal
your diamond tonight,

976
01:26:55,961 --> 01:26:59,630
you will be witness to the capture
of the notorious Phantom.

977
01:27:01,717 --> 01:27:02,884
Gentlemen.

978
01:27:20,444 --> 01:27:21,819
The plans will
have to be changed.

979
01:27:21,904 --> 01:27:23,571
No.

980
01:27:24,114 --> 01:27:28,618
We just have to make sure
Sir Charles doesn't steal the jewel.

981
01:28:19,086 --> 01:28:21,087
- Hello.
- Hello, Tucker.

982
01:28:21,171 --> 01:28:22,588
- Like a drink?
- No, thank you.

983
01:28:22,673 --> 01:28:25,758
I never drink whilst on duty.
You should know that. Never.

984
01:28:25,884 --> 01:28:27,802
- Well, cheers.
- Cheers.

985
01:28:28,053 --> 01:28:30,930
- Warm.
- Yes, it must be hell in there.

986
01:28:32,182 --> 01:28:33,724
Bet it's not so good in there.

987
01:28:34,977 --> 01:28:38,229
- Anything suspicious?
- No, nothing to worry about.

988
01:28:39,481 --> 01:28:42,066
My men are everywhere,
mingling here, mingling there.

989
01:28:42,234 --> 01:28:44,110
Watching all the time, watching.

990
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:52,243
How dare you drink
whilst you're on duty?

991
01:28:52,369 --> 01:28:53,369
Who is inside there?

992
01:28:53,453 --> 01:28:55,454
- Sergeant Walter!
- Sergeant Quinn.

993
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:57,790
Any more behavior like this,
and I'll have your stripes.

994
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,792
Now get out of here
and start mingling again.

995
01:29:04,423 --> 01:29:06,507
Quite funny that,
the zebra and the stripes.

996
01:29:06,800 --> 01:29:10,678
- Yes, very good, very good.
- Not bad, not bad.

997
01:29:10,971 --> 01:29:12,596
I think I'll mingle.

998
01:29:14,057 --> 01:29:15,099
Right.

999
01:29:31,825 --> 01:29:35,369
Didn't I tell you I'd make this
the biggest social success of the year?

1000
01:29:35,454 --> 01:29:36,954
Certainly you did.

1001
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:40,458
The only thing that worries me is,
what do we do for your next one?

1002
01:29:40,625 --> 01:29:44,336
- How can I possibly top this?
- You'll think of something.

1003
01:29:44,504 --> 01:29:47,298
- Excuse me.
- Of course, love. Have a ball!

1004
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:48,799
Hello, you!

1005
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:54,472
May I see
your invitation, please?

1006
01:29:55,640 --> 01:29:56,682
All right.

1007
01:30:04,066 --> 01:30:06,484
Wasn't there another gorilla
in a Rolls-Royce?

1008
01:30:06,610 --> 01:30:08,611
Yes, probably a rich uncle.

1009
01:30:10,572 --> 01:30:12,990
You see, gentlemen?
Perfectly safe.

1010
01:30:13,116 --> 01:30:14,658
One cannot be too careful.

1011
01:30:14,826 --> 01:30:17,203
This party...
all your guests wearing masks.

1012
01:30:17,579 --> 01:30:20,706
It was possible the Phantom
had already done his work.

1013
01:30:20,999 --> 01:30:22,124
Without an invitation,

1014
01:30:22,209 --> 01:30:24,502
how could Sir Charles
get past your guards?

1015
01:30:24,836 --> 01:30:27,713
Where the Phantom
is concerned, Your Highness...

1016
01:30:29,382 --> 01:30:30,508
What's wrong?

1017
01:30:42,687 --> 01:30:43,813
What are you doing?

1018
01:30:43,897 --> 01:30:45,481
The question is,
what are you doing?

1019
01:30:45,565 --> 01:30:48,692
- I protest!
- Remove your head at once!

1020
01:30:48,819 --> 01:30:50,361
Tucker, remove his head.

1021
01:30:55,242 --> 01:30:58,619
- It's our ambassador.
- Ambassador?

1022
01:30:58,703 --> 01:31:00,246
My apologies, Lord Cravenwood.

1023
01:31:00,330 --> 01:31:02,706
The inspector was only acting
with the best of motives.

1024
01:31:02,874 --> 01:31:04,041
Your Highness.

1025
01:31:11,550 --> 01:31:14,301
Lord Cravenwood,
what would your wife think?

1026
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:22,143
- What's he got that I haven't got?
- George!

1027
01:31:22,227 --> 01:31:24,311
- In the flesh.
- What are you doing here?

1028
01:31:24,396 --> 01:31:27,731
- Tarzan let me use the car.
- I've got to talk to you.

1029
01:31:27,816 --> 01:31:29,608
You've got to get out of here.

1030
01:31:31,486 --> 01:31:32,611
Darling...

1031
01:31:32,737 --> 01:31:34,989
Lord Cravenwood, I'm terribly
sorry about what happened.

1032
01:31:35,073 --> 01:31:37,241
I was discussing important things
with Her Highness.

1033
01:31:37,367 --> 01:31:39,034
When I discovered you
outside the library door,

1034
01:31:39,119 --> 01:31:40,911
I thought...

1035
01:31:45,083 --> 01:31:47,209
- The ambassador.
- Yes, I know.

1036
01:31:47,460 --> 01:31:50,004
Darling, you haven't danced
with me all evening, my angel.

1037
01:31:50,130 --> 01:31:53,465
- I'm sorry, my darling.
- That's all for now.

1038
01:31:59,014 --> 01:32:01,682
Pardon me! I'm lost.

1039
01:32:01,766 --> 01:32:04,560
I must have gotten off
the main road.

1040
01:32:04,644 --> 01:32:06,478
I'm on my way to Frascati.

1041
01:32:06,605 --> 01:32:10,524
Go down the road a half mile.
You'll see a sign.

1042
01:32:10,609 --> 01:32:13,777
Turn right. It'll take you
right to the highway.

1043
01:32:33,006 --> 01:32:35,299
Excuse me, but I've got to
talk to Lord Cravenwood.

1044
01:32:35,467 --> 01:32:36,508
It's extremely important.

1045
01:32:36,635 --> 01:32:38,636
That's okay.
He's making me itch, anyway.

1046
01:32:38,762 --> 01:32:39,803
Fine.

1047
01:32:41,139 --> 01:32:44,058
Listen to me. I know what
you're up to, and it won't work.

1048
01:32:44,184 --> 01:32:47,394
- You'll ruin everything.
- Excuse me, Your Excellency.

1049
01:32:47,479 --> 01:32:50,356
May I cut in?
Thank you so much, sir.

1050
01:32:50,607 --> 01:32:51,774
Are you having a good time?

1051
01:32:52,025 --> 01:32:53,984
- Yes, extremely good time.
- Good.

1052
01:33:55,463 --> 01:33:57,631
Fine party, Angela darling.

1053
01:33:57,841 --> 01:34:01,010
Wait till you see
the fireworks at midnight.

1054
01:34:31,750 --> 01:34:34,752
Hello, old boy.
May I have this dance?

1055
01:34:36,254 --> 01:34:39,465
I never learned to dance.
I've simply got natural rhythm.

1056
01:34:39,549 --> 01:34:41,133
You're quite right.

1057
01:34:45,138 --> 01:34:48,891
By Jove, that looked...
It is! It's Sir Charles!

1058
01:34:55,690 --> 01:34:56,815
Tucker!

1059
01:34:59,110 --> 01:35:01,111
- Inspector!
- Tucker!

1060
01:35:06,284 --> 01:35:07,785
Inspector!

1061
01:35:10,121 --> 01:35:12,289
Take your filthy hands
off my asp.

1062
01:35:17,420 --> 01:35:19,296
- Charles?
- Where's the safe?

1063
01:35:19,381 --> 01:35:20,964
In the library.
George is robbing it.

1064
01:35:21,132 --> 01:35:22,216
- Which way?
- Come on.

1065
01:35:23,343 --> 01:35:26,136
- But it's not midnight yet.
- They turned the lights out.

1066
01:35:26,221 --> 01:35:27,930
Her Highness must have
changed her mind.

1067
01:35:28,014 --> 01:35:29,056
All right.

1068
01:35:30,266 --> 01:35:31,934
Be careful.
I can't see a thing.

1069
01:35:32,018 --> 01:35:34,645
Tucker? Where are you?

1070
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:38,148
Watch where you're going!

1071
01:35:53,289 --> 01:35:54,498
It's hell in here.

1072
01:36:01,589 --> 01:36:02,631
A candle!

1073
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:07,344
- Hey, got a match?
- Yes, sir.

1074
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:08,804
Quick, quick.

1075
01:36:29,242 --> 01:36:31,160
What kind of a candle is this?

1076
01:36:37,375 --> 01:36:39,376
In there.
George is in the gorilla suit.

1077
01:36:39,461 --> 01:36:41,211
- Gorilla?
- Good luck.

1078
01:36:44,549 --> 01:36:46,633
Rule, Britannia

1079
01:36:46,718 --> 01:36:48,969
Britannia, rule the waves

1080
01:36:49,053 --> 01:36:53,223
Britons never, never, never
shall be slaves

1081
01:36:53,349 --> 01:36:55,684
Rule, Britannia

1082
01:36:55,768 --> 01:36:58,395
Britannia, rule the waves...
I say!

1083
01:37:11,993 --> 01:37:13,619
Inspector! Inspector!

1084
01:37:13,703 --> 01:37:15,704
Inspector, Sir Charles is here.

1085
01:40:05,500 --> 01:40:07,334
- George?
- Uncle Charles?

1086
01:40:07,418 --> 01:40:09,419
- Have you got it?
- No. Haven't you?

1087
01:40:09,504 --> 01:40:11,755
No. The safe's empty.

1088
01:40:13,925 --> 01:40:15,008
What's that?

1089
01:40:21,015 --> 01:40:23,016
Someone's been
highly dishonest.

1090
01:40:23,101 --> 01:40:24,601
Follow me, men.

1091
01:40:27,939 --> 01:40:29,981
You idiots!
They're getting away from us!

1092
01:40:30,108 --> 01:40:32,526
Help me to my feet, someone.
Mr. Tucker!

1093
01:40:34,153 --> 01:40:36,029
After them! Come on, Tucker!

1094
01:41:02,849 --> 01:41:04,641
Come back! It's me!

1095
01:42:01,324 --> 01:42:03,992
Come on now!
Faster! Faster!

1096
01:42:06,120 --> 01:42:09,956
What's the matter with you?
Can't you drive this thing faster?

1097
01:42:20,718 --> 01:42:23,553
Tucker, you're wrong.
Come on! Quick!

1098
01:42:23,679 --> 01:42:25,972
I tell you, this is the road
they've gone up.

1099
01:42:27,391 --> 01:42:30,644
Don't argue with me!
I know where they've gone.

1100
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:44,574
George, any idea
how we get out of here?

1101
01:42:44,700 --> 01:42:46,326
I don't know.
I've been all over.

1102
01:42:46,410 --> 01:42:48,245
I've been up this street,
that one.

1103
01:42:48,329 --> 01:42:51,832
- How we gonna get out of here?
- Why don't you try the high road?

1104
01:42:51,916 --> 01:42:54,167
I'll take the high road.
You take the low road.

1105
01:42:54,252 --> 01:42:56,336
- So long, Uncle Charles.
- Ciao, George.

1106
01:43:29,287 --> 01:43:30,912
Who taught you
to drive this thing?

1107
01:43:43,885 --> 01:43:46,928
- I see them! That's them!
- No, it isn't!

1108
01:44:19,837 --> 01:44:22,255
Then when I was
thrown out of college,

1109
01:44:22,340 --> 01:44:23,757
I made up my mind.

1110
01:44:25,426 --> 01:44:27,761
I decided to live a little.

1111
01:44:28,638 --> 01:44:31,139
I knew if I continued
my academic endeavors,

1112
01:44:31,223 --> 01:44:33,808
I could depend upon
that check of yours every month.

1113
01:44:33,893 --> 01:44:35,560
You know what I did?

1114
01:44:35,645 --> 01:44:37,687
I took a plush
Hollywood apartment,

1115
01:44:37,772 --> 01:44:42,192
surrounded myself with all of
the advantages of a wealthy bachelor,

1116
01:44:42,360 --> 01:44:45,779
then I sent you glowing reports
of a brilliant academic career.

1117
01:44:45,988 --> 01:44:48,281
I suppose a certain
amount of dishonesty

1118
01:44:48,366 --> 01:44:50,700
is bound to beget
a certain amount of dishonesty.

1119
01:44:56,666 --> 01:44:57,916
But, Inspector...

1120
01:44:58,000 --> 01:45:00,085
Come on, please.
I have not much time.

1121
01:45:21,774 --> 01:45:23,608
Better be right this time.

1122
01:45:27,947 --> 01:45:30,699
- Good morning, gentlemen.
- Good morning, Inspector.

1123
01:45:30,783 --> 01:45:32,367
Guillotine all sharp and shiny?

1124
01:45:33,411 --> 01:45:35,954
The trial is all set
for tomorrow morning.

1125
01:45:36,038 --> 01:45:38,873
- Shouldn't take too long.
- That sounds encouraging.

1126
01:45:38,958 --> 01:45:43,712
Yes, it's encouraging for me,
but bad for you.

1127
01:45:43,796 --> 01:45:45,255
Have some coffee, Inspector.

1128
01:45:45,339 --> 01:45:47,090
You could save yourself
a lot of trouble

1129
01:45:47,174 --> 01:45:49,092
if you would tell me
where the jewel is.

1130
01:45:49,176 --> 01:45:52,345
Tuck into some of that porridge.
Guaranteed good for sleuthing.

1131
01:45:52,430 --> 01:45:55,306
- You refuse to cooperate?
- We've offered porridge and coffee.

1132
01:45:55,391 --> 01:45:56,599
It's all that's left.

1133
01:45:56,684 --> 01:45:58,601
I'm glad you're enjoying yourselves

1134
01:45:58,769 --> 01:46:03,773
because you're going to be here
for the next 20 years...

1135
01:46:15,619 --> 01:46:17,245
Madame Clouseau.

1136
01:46:21,625 --> 01:46:24,294
- Your Highness.
- Madame.

1137
01:46:24,420 --> 01:46:25,628
Won't you sit down?

1138
01:46:29,091 --> 01:46:31,051
I'll be brief and to the point.

1139
01:46:31,135 --> 01:46:33,303
My husband feels
he has enough evidence

1140
01:46:33,429 --> 01:46:35,472
to prove that Sir Charles
is the Phantom

1141
01:46:35,598 --> 01:46:37,640
and to convict George
as his accomplice.

1142
01:46:37,767 --> 01:46:40,560
As I see it,
they only have one chance.

1143
01:46:40,644 --> 01:46:42,479
What is that?

1144
01:46:42,563 --> 01:46:45,398
If Your Highness were
to testify on their behalf,

1145
01:46:45,483 --> 01:46:49,736
somehow convince the jury
they didn't take the diamond.

1146
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:52,614
- You surprise me, Madame.
- I expect to.

1147
01:46:52,698 --> 01:46:57,035
I'm taking the chance you will keep
what I tell you in the strictest confidence.

1148
01:46:57,244 --> 01:47:01,414
- I think I can guess.
- It's not too difficult.

1149
01:47:01,499 --> 01:47:03,500
Being the wife
of Inspector Clouseau,

1150
01:47:03,626 --> 01:47:06,753
you could have been
very helpful to Charles.

1151
01:47:07,838 --> 01:47:09,589
I have been.

1152
01:47:09,673 --> 01:47:13,134
Was stealing my dog
all part of the plan?

1153
01:47:13,219 --> 01:47:15,053
That was the plan.

1154
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:19,224
But I think you should know
that Charles wanted to call it off.

1155
01:47:44,375 --> 01:47:46,042
You've had it all the time.

1156
01:47:46,168 --> 01:47:47,877
You stole the jewel yourself

1157
01:47:48,003 --> 01:47:49,963
before the International Court
made its decision.

1158
01:47:50,047 --> 01:47:54,634
I'd sacrifice it to save Charles,
but it's not so simple.

1159
01:47:54,718 --> 01:47:57,512
Couldn't you say you found it
on the grounds or something?

1160
01:47:57,596 --> 01:48:00,056
They'd just claim he dropped it
making his escape.

1161
01:48:00,141 --> 01:48:04,060
No, to save Charles, we must prove
that someone else stole it.

1162
01:48:04,145 --> 01:48:06,229
But we'd never
be able to do that.

1163
01:48:07,022 --> 01:48:08,231
I have an idea.

1164
01:48:11,902 --> 01:48:14,445
The trial is in its third day.

1165
01:48:14,572 --> 01:48:16,656
Seldom in the history
of Italian jurisprudence

1166
01:48:16,740 --> 01:48:19,284
has a trial created
such intense excitement.

1167
01:48:19,368 --> 01:48:20,535
Thousands of people...

1168
01:48:20,619 --> 01:48:22,495
and it is interesting to note,
most of them women...

1169
01:48:22,580 --> 01:48:24,497
have gathered daily
hoping to catch a glimpse

1170
01:48:24,582 --> 01:48:25,915
of Sir Charles Litton,

1171
01:48:26,125 --> 01:48:29,043
the man accused of being
the notorious Phantom.

1172
01:48:29,128 --> 01:48:32,213
The court adjourned yesterday
as the defense requested time

1173
01:48:32,298 --> 01:48:34,716
to investigate certain
new, important evidence.

1174
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:37,844
And it is rumored that when
the court convenes today,

1175
01:48:37,928 --> 01:48:40,096
the defense will call
a surprise witness.

1176
01:48:40,556 --> 01:48:42,974
The defense has only
one witness, Mr. President.

1177
01:48:43,058 --> 01:48:46,436
Would you call Inspector
Jacques Clouseau to the stand?

1178
01:48:48,439 --> 01:48:49,856
Me, a defense witness?

1179
01:48:50,399 --> 01:48:52,025
Inspector Clouseau?

1180
01:48:52,109 --> 01:48:55,612
Nothing to worry about.
You'll make fools out of them.

1181
01:49:06,165 --> 01:49:09,209
Inspector Clouseau,
you have testified under oath

1182
01:49:09,293 --> 01:49:12,754
to certain pertinent facts
concerning this case.

1183
01:49:12,838 --> 01:49:14,714
Your testimony
and your testimony alone

1184
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:18,718
has been the major factor
in casting suspicion on the defendant.

1185
01:49:18,802 --> 01:49:20,386
Aside from the Phantom himself,

1186
01:49:20,471 --> 01:49:23,848
you are the foremost authority
on the Phantom.

1187
01:49:25,100 --> 01:49:28,228
I have made
the Phantom my life's work.

1188
01:49:28,312 --> 01:49:31,648
You've testified the Phantom
has been a frequent guest

1189
01:49:31,732 --> 01:49:34,150
at the numerous parties
given by Miss Angela Dunning.

1190
01:49:34,276 --> 01:49:35,860
That is correct, yes.

1191
01:49:35,945 --> 01:49:40,031
You've testified it was either during
or sometime soon afterwards

1192
01:49:40,157 --> 01:49:43,576
that certain of Miss Dunning's guests
were robbed of their jewels.

1193
01:49:43,661 --> 01:49:44,702
Yes.

1194
01:49:45,746 --> 01:49:49,707
- How many times did this happen?
- Sixteen.

1195
01:49:49,833 --> 01:49:53,002
- Sixteen parties, sixteen thefts?
- Yes.

1196
01:49:53,128 --> 01:49:56,214
- Sir Charles attended all sixteen?
- All of them.

1197
01:49:56,382 --> 01:49:59,050
And how many of those parties
did you attend, Inspector?

1198
01:49:59,927 --> 01:50:01,302
All of them.

1199
01:50:03,013 --> 01:50:04,472
Very interesting.

1200
01:50:05,641 --> 01:50:08,351
You attended the first party
when the jewels were stolen?

1201
01:50:08,477 --> 01:50:09,769
Yes.

1202
01:50:09,853 --> 01:50:12,563
The jewels were stolen
during or after the party?

1203
01:50:12,940 --> 01:50:14,857
After.

1204
01:50:14,942 --> 01:50:17,193
You knew they were
going to be stolen?

1205
01:50:17,278 --> 01:50:19,654
- Well, yes.
- How did you know?

1206
01:50:19,738 --> 01:50:22,448
That is the modus operandi
of the Phantom.

1207
01:50:22,533 --> 01:50:24,617
He always works that way.

1208
01:50:25,119 --> 01:50:26,577
I see.

1209
01:50:28,330 --> 01:50:31,874
Were the same people
always present at each party?

1210
01:50:31,959 --> 01:50:34,168
No, the guest lists varied.

1211
01:50:34,712 --> 01:50:36,129
Outside of Sir Charles,

1212
01:50:36,213 --> 01:50:38,881
was anybody else always present
at each of these parties?

1213
01:50:41,176 --> 01:50:42,468
No.

1214
01:50:42,553 --> 01:50:46,681
Only Sir Charles was present at
each party when there was a robbery?

1215
01:50:47,474 --> 01:50:49,726
- Yes.
- I see.

1216
01:50:51,353 --> 01:50:54,188
- And what about you?
- Me?

1217
01:50:54,273 --> 01:50:57,442
- Yes, you.
- What about me?

1218
01:50:57,526 --> 01:50:59,527
- You were there.
- Yes.

1219
01:50:59,611 --> 01:51:03,698
Then Sir Charles was not
the only one present at each party.

1220
01:51:03,782 --> 01:51:05,074
What are you suggesting?

1221
01:51:05,159 --> 01:51:08,911
I'm not suggesting
anything... yet.

1222
01:51:12,583 --> 01:51:14,417
Inspector Clouseau?

1223
01:51:15,586 --> 01:51:17,420
How much money do you make?

1224
01:51:19,548 --> 01:51:21,841
- What has this got to do with it?
- Your salary...

1225
01:51:21,925 --> 01:51:25,094
How much does
a police inspector get paid?

1226
01:51:25,262 --> 01:51:29,349
Enough to buy a wife
a $10,000 mink coat?

1227
01:51:29,433 --> 01:51:30,850
No, of course not.

1228
01:51:30,934 --> 01:51:34,437
You're aware your wife spent $7,000
at Yves St. Laurent only last month?

1229
01:51:36,398 --> 01:51:37,774
What?

1230
01:51:37,858 --> 01:51:41,736
- Two months before that, $4,000.
- That's impossible.

1231
01:51:41,820 --> 01:51:45,573
Your wife spent at least $30,000
on clothes during the past year.

1232
01:51:45,657 --> 01:51:47,283
Sir, my wife is very frugal.

1233
01:51:47,368 --> 01:51:50,370
She saves out of
the housekeeping money.

1234
01:51:55,417 --> 01:51:58,378
$30,000 out of
the housekeeping money.

1235
01:51:58,462 --> 01:52:00,505
We have been
married for ten years.

1236
01:52:03,384 --> 01:52:05,510
About the time that
these robberies began

1237
01:52:05,594 --> 01:52:08,262
and the notorious Phantom
came into existence, correct?

1238
01:52:08,347 --> 01:52:10,973
Yes! No, not correct!

1239
01:52:11,058 --> 01:52:13,976
Of course, not correct.
Of course...

1240
01:52:14,061 --> 01:52:18,022
All right, wait. You see...

1241
01:52:19,066 --> 01:52:22,151
- It's not Sir Charles!
- He must be the Phantom!

1242
01:52:22,277 --> 01:52:24,612
It must be the inspector.

1243
01:52:26,657 --> 01:52:27,782
He's the Phantom!

1244
01:52:28,325 --> 01:52:29,367
Now...

1245
01:52:56,687 --> 01:52:59,522
No, I'm not the Phantom!
No, please! Please!

1246
01:53:07,614 --> 01:53:10,408
- Thank you, darling.
- Thank the princess.

1247
01:53:10,534 --> 01:53:13,828
- Look at that.
- No, no! I'm not the Phantom!

1248
01:53:13,912 --> 01:53:15,872
No, no, no!
I'm not the Phantom!

1249
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:18,833
We can't just let him
rot in prison.

1250
01:53:18,917 --> 01:53:20,918
It takes years
for people to rot.

1251
01:53:21,044 --> 01:53:23,296
Besides, when the Phantom
strikes again,

1252
01:53:23,380 --> 01:53:25,381
the inspector will be
as free as a bird.

1253
01:53:25,507 --> 01:53:28,134
Want to come to South America,
George? Family rates?

1254
01:53:28,218 --> 01:53:30,470
- I wouldn't miss it, Uncle Charles.
- That's good.

1255
01:53:30,554 --> 01:53:34,557
When I retire, you might
take over the business.

1256
01:53:46,778 --> 01:53:48,905
Go back! Go home!

1257
01:53:50,657 --> 01:53:52,033
Crazy woman.

1258
01:53:52,117 --> 01:53:54,368
She's the one who tried
to tear off all his clothes.

1259
01:53:54,453 --> 01:53:57,622
- My wife.
- Wife?

1260
01:53:57,748 --> 01:53:59,999
You can thank my mother
for the flowers.

1261
01:54:00,083 --> 01:54:03,711
You're a national hero.
I envy you.

1262
01:54:03,795 --> 01:54:05,171
I'm going to prison.

1263
01:54:05,255 --> 01:54:08,382
A few years,
but after you get out...

1264
01:54:14,264 --> 01:54:16,098
Tell me, Inspector...

1265
01:54:16,183 --> 01:54:18,601
Signor Phantom...

1266
01:54:18,685 --> 01:54:20,811
All those robberies...

1267
01:54:20,896 --> 01:54:23,231
How did you ever manage it?

1268
01:54:25,776 --> 01:54:27,485
You know...

1269
01:54:29,446 --> 01:54:30,780
It wasn't easy.
