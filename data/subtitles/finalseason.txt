1
00:01:29,548 --> 00:01:30,924
I applied for assistant coach here

2
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:32,968
but you sort've wouldn't even
give me an interview.

3
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,219
You're the girls' volleyball coach.

4
00:01:34,303 --> 00:01:37,639
Yeah, but I just had a good meeting
with Coach Van Scoyoc at Norway High.

5
00:01:37,723 --> 00:01:39,057
-Norway?
-Yes, sir.

6
00:01:39,141 --> 00:01:42,102
And since this is my last year here,
I'm taking a job in St. Louis...

7
00:01:42,186 --> 00:01:44,855
So, you want to go coach baseball
at another high school

8
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:46,899
for the two months that you have left?

9
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:48,066
Assistant coach.

10
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,570
Don't you think that's a pretty
unusual request, Mr. Stock?

11
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:54,281
Yeah. But it's Norway.

12
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,206
All right. Go ahead.

13
00:04:10,709 --> 00:04:11,919
Hey, Kent.

14
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,422
Coach, I thought this was
just supposed to be a practice.

15
00:04:15,506 --> 00:04:16,840
It is.

16
00:04:20,677 --> 00:04:21,720
Wow.

17
00:04:23,305 --> 00:04:26,517
-Did you bring that stopwatch, like I asked?
-Yeah.

18
00:04:31,897 --> 00:04:33,690
What's that for?

19
00:04:33,774 --> 00:04:36,485
Well, I just thought I'd take some notes.

20
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:47,120
-Here you go, Coach.
-Thanks, Big-O.

21
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,874
We're gonna take infield now,
just like before a real game.

22
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:54,294
I want you to watch carefully
and I want you to time it.

23
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,338
Time the infield, check.

24
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,466
All right, let's go, infield!

25
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:08,600
Now.

26
00:05:08,976 --> 00:05:10,352
Bring it on.

27
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,701
Come on, now, Brent.

28
00:05:36,753 --> 00:05:38,130
Go wide!

29
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:12,581
One on the end.

30
00:06:39,441 --> 00:06:41,151
Bring it in, boys!

31
00:06:41,318 --> 00:06:44,112
-Under nine minutes, wasn't it?
-8:24.

32
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:48,951
Always keep it under nine.
Always take it first if you can.

33
00:06:50,077 --> 00:06:51,787
What else did you notice?

34
00:06:53,455 --> 00:06:54,706
Well...

35
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:56,291
-Here you go, Coach.
-Thanks.

36
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,709
It was perfect.

37
00:06:57,793 --> 00:06:59,962
You took something off those ground balls,
but...

38
00:07:00,003 --> 00:07:01,004
Why?

39
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,636
Because the other team is watching.

40
00:07:08,846 --> 00:07:11,098
We make it look nice and easy,
and we're already in their heads.

41
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,225
-You got it?
-Yeah.

42
00:07:15,143 --> 00:07:16,186
Outfielders, let's go!

43
00:07:16,395 --> 00:07:18,355
The Norway Tigers have spent
the last three days

44
00:07:18,814 --> 00:07:20,482
wondering if the rains would ever let up.

45
00:07:20,524 --> 00:07:24,361
They finally did today,
allowing the Tigers a rock solid start

46
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,029
toward a second straight state title.

47
00:07:26,113 --> 00:07:30,242
They pounced quickly, did the Tigers,
as Jim Van Scoyoc, their manager, watches.

48
00:07:30,325 --> 00:07:32,953
Kevin Stewart slapped a double
down the line.

49
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,914
Here comes Steve Meyers, he'll score easily.

50
00:07:36,039 --> 00:07:39,376
West Bend couldn't get out
of the third inning as Norway's...

51
00:07:40,043 --> 00:07:41,837
Vries allowed two hits in the first

52
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,506
and collared the Bulldogs
the rest of the way.

53
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,717
Norway hasn't given up a run in the playoffs

54
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,679
and the senior hurler
tossed a shutout on just 43 pitches.

55
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:54,057
The Tigers move to the 1A Finals,
winning it in five.

56
00:07:54,266 --> 00:07:57,519
Well, today's victory puts the Tigers
in the championship game

57
00:07:57,603 --> 00:08:00,230
for the ninth time in the last 10 years.

58
00:08:01,064 --> 00:08:03,525
We ain't the biggest,
or the fastest or even sometimes the best,

59
00:08:03,609 --> 00:08:07,029
but no one's got the fundamentals
down better than our boys.

60
00:08:07,112 --> 00:08:10,824
Every little league coach within 50 miles
of here is an ex-Norway player.

61
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:13,702
It's like having our own
minor league feeder system.

62
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:17,206
Norway baseball tradition
is as rich as Iowa soil.

63
00:08:17,623 --> 00:08:20,501
We grow ball players here like corn.

64
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:24,004
Hell, 80% of this game is defense.

65
00:08:24,087 --> 00:08:26,924
The most important thing to understand

66
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:31,136
is these boys take a great deal of pride
in knowing how to beat you.

67
00:08:31,303 --> 00:08:35,682
It's how they get remembered.
And that's how we're gonna win State.

68
00:08:35,974 --> 00:08:37,601
Coming to you live from Colonel Stadium,

69
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:42,064
this is KZIA-Z102.9,
the voice of Iowa baseball.

70
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:44,858
North Tama with the rally going.

71
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,444
Looking to upset the Norway Tigers

72
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:50,239
and deny them their 19th state title.

73
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:03,794
Long drive to right center!

74
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,682
Time, blue!

75
00:09:19,309 --> 00:09:22,187
And out comes
legendary coach Jim Van Scoyoc

76
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:26,984
to talk to his senior pitcher, Brent Fitz,
who definitely looks to be tiring.

77
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:30,779
How you feeling, Brent?

78
00:09:31,488 --> 00:09:34,783
I'm good. That was a lucky hit.

79
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,041
I'll keep it down.

80
00:09:44,251 --> 00:09:47,462
Well, the thing is Kimmel's on deck.

81
00:09:48,714 --> 00:09:52,467
He already owns you,
so we need to get this next batter out.

82
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:54,678
Don't you bullshit me, now.

83
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,308
I'll get him, Coach.

84
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:04,062
All right, this kid's a dead-pull hitter.

85
00:10:04,146 --> 00:10:07,941
Off-speed, low and away,
he's gonna pull a grounder to short.

86
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:11,069
Now, you tighten your belt and let's get him.

87
00:10:12,613 --> 00:10:14,990
-Come on, buddy, get him now!
-Let's get it going!

88
00:10:15,073 --> 00:10:16,825
One more! One more!

89
00:10:17,284 --> 00:10:20,329
Here we go, Brent! You're all right, kid!
Come on now!

90
00:10:29,463 --> 00:10:30,839
There's a drive!

91
00:10:30,923 --> 00:10:33,675
Deep left field! Fitz going back!

92
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:38,889
It is a foul ball! Oh, my.

93
00:10:38,972 --> 00:10:42,100
Six inches to the right
and Tama's got the lead!

94
00:10:42,267 --> 00:10:46,021
Fitz is clearly on the ropes,
all of his pitches are up in the wheelhouse.

95
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:48,398
Come on, Fitz! Let's go, baby, let's go now!

96
00:10:48,482 --> 00:10:51,777
Let's get this guy! Just like we talked about!
You know how!

97
00:10:53,737 --> 00:10:55,531
Ground ball to short.

98
00:11:20,722 --> 00:11:21,807
Out!

99
00:11:27,062 --> 00:11:30,774
And the Norway Tigers
are the State 1A Baseball Champions

100
00:11:30,858 --> 00:11:32,860
for the 19th time!

101
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:43,412
-That last pitch, how'd you know?
-I scouted the hitter.

102
00:11:43,495 --> 00:11:46,039
-When?
-In my spare time.

103
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:50,377
-Coach, you don't have any spare time.
-I made some. They deserve it.

104
00:11:53,088 --> 00:11:56,216
So the Norway Tigers
win their 19th State Championship

105
00:11:56,258 --> 00:11:58,927
and their 12th under Jim Van Scoyoc.

106
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:05,142
From a town with a population of just 586,
a high school with only 101 students,

107
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:07,269
these players grew up
watching their older brothers,

108
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,771
relatives and friends win state titles.

109
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:12,232
Finally, it's their turn in the sun.

110
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:41,094
We are honored and proud to present
this trophy to Norway High School

111
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:47,476
and to all the people of Norway that have
supported us through thick and thin.

112
00:12:47,518 --> 00:12:49,102
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

113
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:55,108
Mostly thick!

114
00:12:57,569 --> 00:13:00,280
Let's do it again next year
and make it an even 20!

115
00:13:00,364 --> 00:13:01,740
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

116
00:13:15,379 --> 00:13:17,089
Matthew, we did it again, didn't we?

117
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,049
Do you ever get used to this?

118
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,010
Oh, we don't take anything for granted
around here.

119
00:13:22,052 --> 00:13:25,806
We're so grateful for baseball,
and so proud of the boys.

120
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:29,977
Of course, they don't have to live
with Coach Grumpy all through the season.

121
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:33,021
He speaks very highly of you, by the way.

122
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:34,106
He does?

123
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,194
-Oh, bye.
-There you go.

124
00:13:44,449 --> 00:13:48,662
Is it true Hal Trosky once hit a ball that went
all the way out to the railroad track?

125
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,622
That's what the old timers say.

126
00:13:50,706 --> 00:13:53,333
I mean, that's what, 500 feet?

127
00:13:54,084 --> 00:13:57,212
Hell, son,
that was the longest home run in history.

128
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:59,840
That ball traveled 200 miles.

129
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:03,260
See, he hit it out of the park right over there.

130
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:06,305
It took one bounce on the highway,
landed on a freight train that was going by

131
00:14:06,388 --> 00:14:08,515
and ended up in Chicago.

132
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:10,392
Yeah.

133
00:14:12,436 --> 00:14:14,938
Oh, we had a good run, didn't we?

134
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:17,941
Thank you for letting me be a part of it.
I learned a lot.

135
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:20,485
You're a good coach. Boys like you.

136
00:14:21,653 --> 00:14:24,364
There's a bunch of them
coming back next season.

137
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:25,866
What about this rumor

138
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:29,411
that Norway's gonna close
and merge with Madison Community?

139
00:14:32,581 --> 00:14:34,583
It'll never go through.

140
00:14:37,211 --> 00:14:39,254
I can't imagine
why anyone would want to destroy

141
00:14:39,338 --> 00:14:41,798
something that means so much
to these kids.

142
00:14:42,424 --> 00:14:43,425
Yeah.

143
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:49,890
Kent, Norway is baseball.

144
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:57,940
Anyway, if I don't get home soon,

145
00:14:58,023 --> 00:15:01,944
Chic's gonna feed my dinner
to the dog again.

146
00:15:02,027 --> 00:15:04,154
How about you? You eat yet?
There's always plenty.

147
00:15:04,196 --> 00:15:08,575
No, I'm good. I'd just like to stay out here
for a little while longer.

148
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:13,539
-Couldn't have done it without you, Kent.
-Sure, you could.

149
00:15:13,622 --> 00:15:15,624
Well, I wouldn't have wanted to.

150
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:20,754
I'll see you next season.
We'll go for an even 20.

151
00:15:20,838 --> 00:15:25,843
-Coach, I'm not coming back next season.
-Oh, that's right.

152
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:30,138
Yep. I got a job in St. Louis, whole deal.

153
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:33,267
See what big city life's about.

154
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:38,313
That's too bad.
The game could use more people like you.

155
00:15:58,709 --> 00:16:01,461
No, no, everything's right on schedule, sir.

156
00:16:01,545 --> 00:16:05,215
Yeah, the inspection's on Friday.
You're already pre-approved for the loan,

157
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:09,219
so all we need is for the bank
to accept the appraisal.

158
00:16:09,303 --> 00:16:11,096
And then it's just a formality.

159
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:14,558
Right, right.
Well, I'll call you as soon as I hear anything.

160
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,643
Okay? Have a great night.

161
00:16:16,727 --> 00:16:17,895
Mitch!

162
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:19,605
Mitch!

163
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:24,318
Mitch, what are you doing?

164
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:27,654
Hey, how many times
have I told you not to do that?

165
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,615
Seven.

166
00:16:29,656 --> 00:16:34,036
Eight, if you include right now.
What do I win?

167
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:35,454
You think it's funny?

168
00:16:35,537 --> 00:16:37,664
After what those things did
to your mother's health?

169
00:16:37,748 --> 00:16:43,587
Dad, I can't stay in there and listen
to your real estate B.S. 24-7, okay?

170
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:45,130
I'm getting some air.

171
00:16:45,172 --> 00:16:48,342
Well, my real estate B.S.
is what pays all the bills around here.

172
00:16:48,425 --> 00:16:50,469
One of these days
you're gonna have to make a living yourself.

173
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:54,806
Okay, when I work, I'm gonna work to live,
not live to work. Okay?

174
00:16:56,517 --> 00:16:59,102
You think I like working all the time?

175
00:16:59,186 --> 00:17:02,648
Mom sure thought so.
Hey, like mother like son, right?

176
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:11,698
You know what?
Why don't you go pack a bag?

177
00:17:11,782 --> 00:17:14,993
-What for?
-You'll find out when we get there.

178
00:17:15,953 --> 00:17:17,120
Okay.

179
00:17:17,579 --> 00:17:19,414
Why don't you pack two?

180
00:17:23,377 --> 00:17:24,795
"What do I win?"

181
00:17:31,718 --> 00:17:35,222
The way I see it, it's a win-win proposition.
Madison's all for it.

182
00:17:35,305 --> 00:17:38,851
-What about the baseball team?
-Oh, I cannot wait to hear this!

183
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:42,771
Bigger opportunity
because of a larger school system.

184
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:45,065
Now that's the part that don't figure,
Mr. Makepeace.

185
00:17:45,148 --> 00:17:48,193
If you close Norway High
and merge it into Madison,

186
00:17:48,277 --> 00:17:51,572
what happens to our baseball players?
What happens to Coach?

187
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:55,325
It's a free market system.
They have to compete like everybody else.

188
00:17:55,409 --> 00:17:56,994
Cream rises to the top.

189
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:59,872
Didn't you pull your son out of Norway

190
00:17:59,955 --> 00:18:04,376
because Coach Van Scoyoc wouldn't let him
play baseball and football at the same time?

191
00:18:04,459 --> 00:18:07,254
Well, now, that's got
nothing to do with this.

192
00:18:07,796 --> 00:18:10,632
The school board's responsibility
is educational.

193
00:18:10,716 --> 00:18:13,010
Sports programs come secondary.

194
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:14,761
How do we win here, Harvey?

195
00:18:14,803 --> 00:18:19,558
Lower taxes. Plus, kids like your boy, Kevin,
get a better opportunity for education.

196
00:18:19,641 --> 00:18:25,564
Norway's got a 16-to-1 student/teacher ratio
and Madison's got 22-to-1.

197
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:26,940
How's that better?

198
00:18:27,024 --> 00:18:29,318
We sent two sons and a daughter
to this school

199
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:32,112
and they're all on the dean's list in college.

200
00:18:33,614 --> 00:18:38,952
You take away our school,
those kids won't be shopping in our store.

201
00:18:38,994 --> 00:18:40,746
We'll lose our business.

202
00:18:40,829 --> 00:18:44,458
And we're not the only ones.
What about our local economy?

203
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:49,546
Well, I can't address any issues
except the educational ones.

204
00:18:49,838 --> 00:18:51,757
Why the hell not, Harv?

205
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:55,928
Millie and Lou's store's
been a part of this town for five generations.

206
00:18:57,262 --> 00:19:00,307
There's more at stake here
than closing a school.

207
00:19:00,349 --> 00:19:02,809
Nobody said anything
about closing the school.

208
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:06,313
No, not yet you haven't.
You'll get around to it, won't you?

209
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:10,859
Well, I mean, even if it does happen,
you're all gonna make out like bandits.

210
00:19:10,943 --> 00:19:14,530
The agreement offers
all kinds of financial incentives.

211
00:19:14,613 --> 00:19:17,157
Let Miss Hudson here explain this to you.

212
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:27,709
Yes, the state gives $3,000
to each local school district per student.

213
00:19:27,918 --> 00:19:30,504
Now, Norway would retain a percentage
of that allowance

214
00:19:30,587 --> 00:19:33,090
without incurring
any of the educational expense.

215
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:36,426
Would someone please translate that
into English?

216
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:42,057
She said the state is willing to bribe you
to the tune of $3,000 a kid

217
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:44,268
for closing down the school.

218
00:19:44,518 --> 00:19:47,145
You really think you can place a value
on something like that?

219
00:19:47,229 --> 00:19:52,109
Well, changes in state budget regulations
are favoring the larger districts.

220
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:56,154
If you don't like the law, I would suggest
that you take it up with the legislature.

221
00:19:56,238 --> 00:19:58,657
Well, you know there's no time for that.

222
00:19:59,074 --> 00:20:00,909
Perhaps you're out of your league.

223
00:20:00,993 --> 00:20:05,372
I guess I missed the announcement
that Des Moines has made the majors.

224
00:20:05,455 --> 00:20:07,249
Let's just be fair here.

225
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:12,796
The state has its job to do
but you still all have a right to be heard.

226
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:14,131
Matthew?

227
00:20:15,090 --> 00:20:17,634
Harvey's right.
Anyone who opposes this merger

228
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:20,429
can file a petition for a feasibility study.

229
00:20:20,512 --> 00:20:23,265
But it'll take 20%
of the eligible voters' signatures.

230
00:20:23,348 --> 00:20:26,018
How about your signature, Matthew?

231
00:20:26,101 --> 00:20:29,771
You gonna sign it
so your boys can keep playing for Norway?

232
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:33,317
I didn't think so.

233
00:20:34,818 --> 00:20:37,404
I'm done talking to these people.

234
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:40,282
I'm not.
I want to hear more about that petition.

235
00:20:42,951 --> 00:20:44,453
I'll walk home.

236
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:00,636
Good night.

237
00:21:01,094 --> 00:21:03,388
You don't really believe
all that numbers crap, do you?

238
00:21:03,472 --> 00:21:04,932
Yes, I do.

239
00:21:05,015 --> 00:21:08,519
The State's helped over 100 school districts
with similar agreements.

240
00:21:08,602 --> 00:21:12,314
And how many of them have 19 state
baseball championships under their belt?

241
00:21:12,397 --> 00:21:14,149
Is that what this is all about?

242
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:17,236
This team beats the biggest schools
in the state year after year.

243
00:21:17,319 --> 00:21:20,322
At baseball. But what about at life?

244
00:21:20,405 --> 00:21:22,574
They'll have better opportunities
in the real world

245
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:25,160
if they have more resources at school.

246
00:21:25,244 --> 00:21:27,120
You don't get it, do you?

247
00:21:27,204 --> 00:21:30,290
Kids in small towns like Norway,
they have something special.

248
00:21:30,374 --> 00:21:35,838
If they want to play baseball, join the band,
run for student council, they just do it.

249
00:21:35,921 --> 00:21:38,340
Nobody gets left out. Everyone participates.

250
00:21:38,423 --> 00:21:41,426
And you cannot tell me
it's like that in all the big schools.

251
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:43,804
Don't tell me how to do my job.

252
00:21:45,055 --> 00:21:46,265
I'm not.

253
00:21:47,266 --> 00:21:49,268
Maybe you could get a different job.

254
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:14,751
How long do I gotta stay for?

255
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:18,422
You're enrolled
in the high school tomorrow.

256
00:22:18,463 --> 00:22:21,884
Mom, Dad, listen,
got no cell service or I would've called.

257
00:22:21,967 --> 00:22:24,720
-Great.
-But listen, I'll explain everything.

258
00:22:24,803 --> 00:22:28,140
-Let me look at it. Wait. Wait for it.
-Come on.

259
00:22:30,267 --> 00:22:32,936
First team All-State.

260
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,314
How are we gonna keep you
down on the farm now?

261
00:22:35,397 --> 00:22:36,648
-Come on, man.
-Look at this guy.

262
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:39,276
Oh, you guys are gonna kill them again
next season.

263
00:22:39,318 --> 00:22:40,402
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

264
00:22:40,485 --> 00:22:43,655
-But playing for who, Madison?
-Does it matter?

265
00:22:43,822 --> 00:22:45,365
I'm not playing for Madison.

266
00:22:45,449 --> 00:22:48,243
No way. I can't imagine playing for anyone...

267
00:22:48,327 --> 00:22:50,412
-Hey, guys, guys, guys, guys.
-Hey, look at this kid.

268
00:22:54,333 --> 00:22:56,460
-Camels.
-ID?

269
00:23:00,547 --> 00:23:02,299
I left it in my Jag.

270
00:23:04,051 --> 00:23:05,928
You better go get it.

271
00:23:08,222 --> 00:23:09,848
Are you kidding?

272
00:23:12,518 --> 00:23:13,685
Denied.

273
00:23:15,979 --> 00:23:18,315
Did you see that Johnny Rambo jacket?

274
00:23:18,398 --> 00:23:20,359
What are you looking at?

275
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:26,740
-Camels.
-ID?

276
00:23:26,824 --> 00:23:28,784
I left it in my tractor.

277
00:23:30,828 --> 00:23:33,247
Steve, your perspective is off on this.

278
00:23:33,288 --> 00:23:37,292
Get your trigger on there, get a good finish,
it'll be all right.

279
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:48,136
Look who it is.

280
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:49,596
You're late.

281
00:23:52,015 --> 00:23:53,976
I'm talking to you, son.

282
00:23:55,644 --> 00:23:58,814
I'm new, so cut me some slack.

283
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:03,068
I just did.

284
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:08,866
I know your dad.

285
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:13,453
Sunglasses back, please.

286
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:16,874
-We don't do late around here.
-Whatever.

287
00:24:19,376 --> 00:24:21,670
You're late again, I'll flunk you.

288
00:24:24,298 --> 00:24:26,884
Why don't you take a seat over there?

289
00:24:27,050 --> 00:24:29,386
Right in the back of the class.

290
00:24:30,596 --> 00:24:31,597
Don't cry.

291
00:24:33,473 --> 00:24:34,850
What's wrong with that kid?

292
00:24:34,933 --> 00:24:39,146
Dennis, Dennis, can you hear me?
Dennis, stay... Can you hear me now?

293
00:24:39,188 --> 00:24:40,230
-Hold on...
-Dear Father...

294
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:43,150
No, it's not my phone. I'm in Bum-fart, Iowa.

295
00:24:43,233 --> 00:24:45,694
-...thank you for the food...
-Dennis, I need you to take care of this.

296
00:24:45,777 --> 00:24:49,406
-...and for your wonderful bounty.
-Hold on, hold on, hold on.

297
00:24:49,489 --> 00:24:52,701
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on,
I'll get it. Stay.

298
00:24:52,784 --> 00:24:55,204
-It has to happen by tomorrow.
-Amen!

299
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:57,122
-Dennis, can you hear me?
-Amen.

300
00:24:57,206 --> 00:24:58,332
Amen.

301
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:01,835
What's wrong with the phone on the wall?

302
00:25:03,086 --> 00:25:04,838
It's a rotary.

303
00:25:04,922 --> 00:25:08,675
Dad, this is technology.
It makes my life a lot easier.

304
00:25:14,306 --> 00:25:18,852
What did you think of Coach Van Scoyoc,
Mitch?

305
00:25:20,229 --> 00:25:22,606
Van Nazi's more like it.

306
00:25:22,689 --> 00:25:25,651
I don't see what the big freaking whoop
about him is.

307
00:25:27,861 --> 00:25:29,029
He's a farmer.

308
00:25:29,112 --> 00:25:32,115
That "farmer" was my coach, too.

309
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:36,119
Not to mention
the national coach of the year.

310
00:25:36,203 --> 00:25:40,332
You might try listening to him.
You might actually learn something.

311
00:25:41,333 --> 00:25:45,212
-Something important.
-Supposed to learn that stuff from you.

312
00:25:59,017 --> 00:26:00,394
Sorry, Mom.

313
00:26:06,358 --> 00:26:09,820
You didn't find anything funny in that,
did you, Mitch?

314
00:26:10,612 --> 00:26:11,613
No.

315
00:26:12,823 --> 00:26:16,451
Maybe you wanna throw a little "ma'am"
in after that.

316
00:26:16,535 --> 00:26:17,786
No, ma'am.

317
00:26:23,041 --> 00:26:25,335
Don't you have something to do?

318
00:27:00,913 --> 00:27:04,124
-She made you come out here, didn't she?
-Shut up.

319
00:27:06,418 --> 00:27:11,507
-I don't know what I'm doing wrong, Dad.
-You were a bit rowdy in your day, too.

320
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:13,592
That was a long time ago.

321
00:27:15,219 --> 00:27:18,847
-When I got you out of jail?
-One time.

322
00:27:19,723 --> 00:27:22,059
You were naked.

323
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:25,562
-It was called streaking, Dad.
-In an old age home?

324
00:27:25,646 --> 00:27:29,399
It's pretty innocent
compared to what Mitch is getting into.

325
00:27:30,108 --> 00:27:34,071
I just thought that bringing him here
would be good for both of us.

326
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:36,740
Then why are you leaving?

327
00:27:36,824 --> 00:27:39,952
Because, Dad, I'm not a small town guy.
You know that.

328
00:27:40,035 --> 00:27:41,703
I'm more big city.

329
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,374
How's that working out for you?

330
00:27:49,920 --> 00:27:56,635
Well, I can't run my business from here,
so I don't know what else to do.

331
00:27:56,885 --> 00:28:02,266
-Sorry I have to dump him on you like this.
-Well, nothing we can do about that now.

332
00:28:02,808 --> 00:28:04,184
Jared!

333
00:28:05,769 --> 00:28:07,604
We'll look after him.

334
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:16,280
Jim, you and l
basically want the same thing.

335
00:28:16,321 --> 00:28:17,990
How do you figure that, Harvey?

336
00:28:18,073 --> 00:28:20,993
Well, you want what's best for the town,
so do l.

337
00:28:21,034 --> 00:28:25,789
Sometimes you just have to ride the horse
in the direction in which it's going.

338
00:28:25,873 --> 00:28:29,293
Harvey, I get the uncomfortable feeling

339
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:32,921
you're trying to put something
where I don't want it put.

340
00:28:33,505 --> 00:28:35,340
Okay, here's the deal.

341
00:28:35,883 --> 00:28:40,095
I let you finish out that contract of yours,
which takes you to the end of June.

342
00:28:40,179 --> 00:28:43,807
Then I transition you to Madison
to the industrial arts position,

343
00:28:43,849 --> 00:28:46,310
which, mind you, currently doesn't exist.

344
00:28:51,106 --> 00:28:52,774
And my team?

345
00:28:52,858 --> 00:28:56,862
Oh, your boys get to play one last season
of Norway baseball,

346
00:28:56,945 --> 00:28:58,739
but without you,

347
00:28:58,822 --> 00:29:01,950
without the "save our school" petition
your wife is circulating,

348
00:29:02,034 --> 00:29:04,036
and without your big mouth.

349
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:05,787
I think that just might go a long way

350
00:29:05,871 --> 00:29:10,501
toward making the transition to Madison
easier for this town to understand.

351
00:29:10,584 --> 00:29:14,880
If anybody asks me something,
I tell them exactly what I think.

352
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:21,386
You know, you tell the truth, Harvey,
you don't have to remember what you said.

353
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:25,641
-Are we done here?
-Looks like.

354
00:29:31,647 --> 00:29:35,150
You have no idea what you're trying to kill.

355
00:29:47,287 --> 00:29:49,498
-Thanks very much.
-Thank you.

356
00:29:55,295 --> 00:29:58,423
-Hey, Kent.
-Coach.

357
00:29:58,507 --> 00:30:00,509
I didn't realize
your truck could make it this far.

358
00:30:00,592 --> 00:30:02,761
Hey, don't badmouth my truck.

359
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:06,932
-What's up?
-Oh, nothing. I...

360
00:30:09,184 --> 00:30:13,730
Just thought I'd stop by and see
if you still had that little notebook of yours.

361
00:30:13,814 --> 00:30:16,733
You drove 250 miles just to ask me that?

362
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:21,280
Well, I thought you might be interested
in what's been going on up in Norway.

363
00:30:21,363 --> 00:30:25,325
See, they're not gonna let me
coach anymore. They're killing baseball.

364
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:30,831
There's a big town meeting next month.
You might want to be there.

365
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:33,792
Now, we ain't the biggest or the fastest...
Norway baseball tradition...

366
00:30:33,834 --> 00:30:37,671
We grow ball players here...
80% of this game is defense...

367
00:30:39,173 --> 00:30:41,466
Anyway, think about it, will you?

368
00:30:41,508 --> 00:30:47,931
You know, those old timers say
that baseball's the only game on earth

369
00:30:48,015 --> 00:30:50,726
where the object is to get home, Kent.

370
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:10,370
Mitch, company!

371
00:31:12,414 --> 00:31:16,585
Mitch, Patrick and Richie here
want to play catch with you.

372
00:31:16,668 --> 00:31:18,670
-Catch?
-Yeah, okay.

373
00:31:19,171 --> 00:31:21,048
-Richie?
-Patrick.

374
00:31:21,089 --> 00:31:22,883
Patrick. Richie.

375
00:31:22,966 --> 00:31:25,719
-Richie.
-I don't play baseball.

376
00:31:25,802 --> 00:31:29,056
Try this on for size,
Mr. "l Don't Play Baseball."

377
00:31:29,139 --> 00:31:32,643
He was an all-star,
straight up through Colt League.

378
00:31:32,726 --> 00:31:35,020
He used to send me pictures.

379
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:39,441
Go on, get out of here. Play some ball.

380
00:31:42,528 --> 00:31:46,990
-You should come out for the team.
-Not with that dictator.

381
00:31:48,116 --> 00:31:50,118
Man, Van Scoyoc's a great coach.

382
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:53,705
Yeah, I heard like a billion times.

383
00:31:53,789 --> 00:31:57,584
-You wanna see me pitch?
-Knock yourself out, kid.

384
00:32:03,048 --> 00:32:05,551
-You got a live one there, don't you?
-Is that as hard as you can throw?

385
00:32:05,634 --> 00:32:06,677
No.

386
00:32:10,472 --> 00:32:12,766
-How old are you?
-Fourteen.

387
00:32:12,808 --> 00:32:16,270
Fourteen?
You should try out for the softball team.

388
00:32:18,397 --> 00:32:20,190
You'd give them hell.

389
00:32:21,108 --> 00:32:22,901
Who do l...

390
00:32:23,318 --> 00:32:26,363
Who do I see
about getting weed around here?

391
00:32:29,116 --> 00:32:31,493
-Go get the ball, Richie.
-There's some ditch weed right by the barn.

392
00:32:31,535 --> 00:32:32,786
-Get the ball, Richie.
-It grows wild around here.

393
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:34,913
Get the damn ball, Richie!

394
00:32:35,164 --> 00:32:36,999
Okay.

395
00:32:37,958 --> 00:32:40,961
I don't want you talking about that stuff
in front of my kid brother, okay?

396
00:32:41,003 --> 00:32:43,172
-What's the big deal?
-'Cause we don't do that crap around here

397
00:32:43,255 --> 00:32:45,674
and I don't want Richie getting any ideas,
all right?

398
00:32:45,757 --> 00:32:47,009
You got it?

399
00:32:47,050 --> 00:32:51,722
Listen, you stupid hick, nobody asked you
to come around here and play ball with me.

400
00:32:52,848 --> 00:32:54,808
Yeah, they did.

401
00:32:56,310 --> 00:32:57,895
Come on, Richie.

402
00:32:58,478 --> 00:33:00,981
-Richie, come on!
-See you, Mitch.

403
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:11,033
I know some of you are concerned
about Norway losing its identity,

404
00:33:11,116 --> 00:33:13,452
especially when it comes
to our sports teams.

405
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:16,330
So it's been decided that, for one year,

406
00:33:16,413 --> 00:33:19,166
our scores will be reported
"Madison/Norway."

407
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:20,209
-What?
-What?

408
00:33:20,292 --> 00:33:22,127
-B.S.
-Yeah.

409
00:33:22,503 --> 00:33:26,215
A Norway student's never gonna be able
to participate in Madison.

410
00:33:26,298 --> 00:33:29,968
Not with farm chores before and after school
and a 20-mile drive to and from.

411
00:33:30,052 --> 00:33:31,720
-Yeah.
-That's right.

412
00:33:36,725 --> 00:33:40,020
The Madison baseball coach
is never gonna start a Norway player.

413
00:33:40,103 --> 00:33:41,438
Not even a good one.

414
00:33:41,522 --> 00:33:44,233
Do you realize how much shit
he'd catch for that?

415
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:45,275
Yeah.

416
00:33:46,902 --> 00:33:51,114
And how about the average player?
He's got no chance.

417
00:33:53,116 --> 00:33:58,288
So you tell me again about all this
opportunity you keep pitching us?

418
00:34:05,045 --> 00:34:09,800
So what exactly you telling us, Harvey?
You saying this is a done deal?

419
00:34:10,676 --> 00:34:12,135
Yes, I am.

420
00:34:13,762 --> 00:34:17,724
What? Wait.
We have almost 400 signatures.

421
00:34:17,808 --> 00:34:21,478
That's 90% of the electorate! 90%!

422
00:34:21,812 --> 00:34:23,188
Right here.

423
00:34:24,314 --> 00:34:25,691
Right here.

424
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:29,153
Four hundred. Four hundred, Harvey.

425
00:34:30,445 --> 00:34:32,447
Well, thank you for that, Chic.

426
00:34:32,531 --> 00:34:35,284
That represents a lot of hard work
on your part.

427
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:39,288
We've got the signatures.
The merger is postponed.

428
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:43,292
Yes! Yes! Yes!

429
00:34:46,461 --> 00:34:47,713
Sam?

430
00:34:51,425 --> 00:34:54,887
You had 30 days
to file this with the State Board.

431
00:34:56,180 --> 00:34:59,099
We're the School Board, Chic. I'm sorry.

432
00:34:59,391 --> 00:35:01,268
-What?
-What the hell?

433
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:04,938
You didn't tell us that last time.
Did you just forget?

434
00:35:05,022 --> 00:35:08,775
Or did you conveniently leave that part out?

435
00:35:09,443 --> 00:35:11,028
Do something, Pop.

436
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:15,157
I'm afraid Sam is technically right.
The petition is invalid.

437
00:35:21,747 --> 00:35:23,290
Let's go, boys.

438
00:35:34,468 --> 00:35:36,595
Just so everyone understands,

439
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:39,598
you all are going to go into a closed session
with the Madison School Board

440
00:35:39,681 --> 00:35:42,142
and vote against the wishes
of this entire community

441
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:44,186
based on a minor legal technicality?

442
00:35:44,269 --> 00:35:45,771
It is the duty of this board

443
00:35:45,854 --> 00:35:50,275
to represent the best interests
of this community as we understand it.

444
00:35:54,071 --> 00:35:55,823
Does that seem fair to you, Miss Hudson?

445
00:35:55,906 --> 00:35:59,326
It's the state's position
that small schools are a financial burden

446
00:35:59,409 --> 00:36:02,871
and aims to consolidate
as many of them as possible.

447
00:36:05,123 --> 00:36:06,208
Wow.

448
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:22,516
Excuse me.

449
00:36:23,517 --> 00:36:27,229
Mr. Stock? Can I talk to you?

450
00:36:27,312 --> 00:36:29,231
You did your talking in there.

451
00:36:29,314 --> 00:36:32,609
-Listen, I'm not the enemy here.
-Then who are you?

452
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:35,070
I'm someone doing my job.

453
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:38,490
Now listen,
I know that this is a lot of change all at once

454
00:36:38,532 --> 00:36:39,783
but you need to look at the bigger picture.

455
00:36:39,867 --> 00:36:43,203
This is what is best for this town
and what's best for this school.

456
00:36:43,287 --> 00:36:45,998
This school is all the town has.

457
00:36:46,039 --> 00:36:47,541
Have you even been
to the other small towns

458
00:36:47,624 --> 00:36:49,918
that have had their schools
ripped out from under them?

459
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:50,961
No.

460
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:52,421
Then how can you say it'll be better for us

461
00:36:52,504 --> 00:36:55,090
when you haven't gone back
and checked for yourself?

462
00:36:55,174 --> 00:36:58,343
-I guess that's not part of your job, is it?
-No, it isn't.

463
00:36:58,427 --> 00:37:01,847
I'm afraid you don't know
what you're talking about.

464
00:37:01,889 --> 00:37:04,016
I challenge you.

465
00:37:04,099 --> 00:37:07,311
Go back to those towns
and have a look for yourself.

466
00:37:08,437 --> 00:37:11,398
-It's not her fault, you know?
-I know.

467
00:37:12,566 --> 00:37:14,026
Some of it is.

468
00:37:21,116 --> 00:37:24,703
-Can I take out the truck?
-"May l"...

469
00:37:24,786 --> 00:37:28,248
-Where do you want to go?
-I don't know. I'm just bored.

470
00:37:28,332 --> 00:37:32,044
Well, when you have someplace to go,
let me know, I'll drive you.

471
00:37:36,215 --> 00:37:38,509
What's he so upset about?

472
00:37:38,592 --> 00:37:42,721
Can't seem to get past the fact
that life isn't always fair.

473
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:50,854
He took the truck.

474
00:37:52,272 --> 00:37:54,483
Life's gonna get more unfair.

475
00:38:05,410 --> 00:38:07,120
I'll pay you later!

476
00:38:45,659 --> 00:38:47,411
How you doing?

477
00:38:47,494 --> 00:38:50,914
-Loving life.
-Really? Because I heard you were bored.

478
00:38:51,957 --> 00:38:53,750
Get out of the truck.

479
00:39:00,048 --> 00:39:01,133
Keys?

480
00:39:02,634 --> 00:39:05,095
Let's go see what your grandpa
has to say about this.

481
00:39:27,826 --> 00:39:29,578
When you're done with that,

482
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:33,457
grind the feed, feed the pork chops.

483
00:39:33,540 --> 00:39:37,085
Cycle of life. In one end and out the other.

484
00:39:37,169 --> 00:39:41,340
-I don't think I'm bored anymore.
-Sure you still are.

485
00:39:41,423 --> 00:39:42,674
Trust me.

486
00:39:53,602 --> 00:39:57,523
He's got a big mouth. I warned him.

487
00:39:57,606 --> 00:40:00,734
You know what? We don't bring him back
for the rest of the season.

488
00:40:00,818 --> 00:40:04,696
So you're going to cancel the season?

489
00:40:04,780 --> 00:40:07,032
What, and let them go out as martyrs?

490
00:40:07,115 --> 00:40:09,618
Without Van Scoyoc coaching them,
they go out as losers.

491
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:12,204
The sooner this Norway baseball
tradition ends,

492
00:40:12,287 --> 00:40:14,206
the sooner we get the merger behind us.

493
00:40:14,289 --> 00:40:19,127
What do you know about this Stock guy,
the assistant?

494
00:40:19,169 --> 00:40:21,922
He's from Belle Plaine.

495
00:40:22,005 --> 00:40:26,760
He filled in half of last year
when Van Scoyoc's guy moved on.

496
00:40:26,844 --> 00:40:29,471
He coach ball at Belle Plaine?

497
00:40:29,513 --> 00:40:31,056
Volleyball.

498
00:40:31,139 --> 00:40:33,809
Excellent.
He's got a big mouth, but he'll do.

499
00:40:42,693 --> 00:40:46,238
Grandpa's got me working hard,
pretty hard.

500
00:40:48,699 --> 00:40:50,742
Well, you could maybe take some of
the heat off

501
00:40:50,826 --> 00:40:54,746
if you found yourself
something to do besides

502
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:57,666
stealing trucks and smoking cigarettes.

503
00:41:00,502 --> 00:41:02,796
Get yourself a hobby.

504
00:41:05,174 --> 00:41:08,010
Or something. You know, anything.

505
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:12,389
Where is Grandpa?

506
00:41:12,472 --> 00:41:14,057
He's down there.

507
00:41:16,602 --> 00:41:20,189
Smoking a cigar. Still thinks I don't know.

508
00:41:40,751 --> 00:41:43,045
Don't tell your grandma, you know,

509
00:41:43,128 --> 00:41:45,255
she thinks I gave them up.

510
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:48,634
I hate it here.

511
00:41:50,761 --> 00:41:52,638
I want to go back home.

512
00:41:53,597 --> 00:41:56,892
You know, I had this sergeant at Fort Bragg

513
00:41:56,975 --> 00:41:59,978
and he said something to me once,
stuck with me.

514
00:42:00,062 --> 00:42:04,024
"Even the easy things are tough
if you do them half-heartedly."

515
00:42:04,107 --> 00:42:08,946
He actually said "half-assed,"
I'm just cleaning it up a little.

516
00:42:10,155 --> 00:42:14,284
"l hate this, I hate that, I'm so bored,"
you know.

517
00:42:14,368 --> 00:42:17,496
Stop whining.
You're just making things tough, you know.

518
00:42:17,579 --> 00:42:20,791
Put your heart in something.

519
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:21,959
Hey!

520
00:42:25,504 --> 00:42:29,049
I know it's been tough on you guys
since your mom passed.

521
00:42:33,512 --> 00:42:36,849
It's all right. It's okay.

522
00:42:36,890 --> 00:42:40,227
You're supposed to feel this way, you know.

523
00:42:42,813 --> 00:42:46,733
Your grandma thinks
that you need a hobby.

524
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:49,319
Something you can put your heart in,
you know.

525
00:42:49,403 --> 00:42:50,988
Not this here.

526
00:42:57,369 --> 00:43:01,540
-What kind of hobby?
-Well, son, she said that you'd figure it out.

527
00:43:01,582 --> 00:43:03,876
You know, she's a smart woman.

528
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:05,794
Why I snatched her up.

529
00:43:10,048 --> 00:43:13,719
-She told you to come out here, didn't she?
-No.

530
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,305
Shut up. Come on.

531
00:43:18,223 --> 00:43:20,184
Okay, she did.

532
00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:34,114
Coming! Hang on a sec.

533
00:43:43,874 --> 00:43:46,835
-Hi.
-Hi.

534
00:43:47,794 --> 00:43:50,339
I'm going to go check on some of those
other small towns.

535
00:43:50,422 --> 00:43:52,382
You are?

536
00:43:52,466 --> 00:43:57,179
No one will care that Norway's been closed.
Those kids will be better off.

537
00:43:57,262 --> 00:44:00,474
You don't really understand all that much
about small town America, do you?

538
00:44:00,557 --> 00:44:03,977
-I'm from Des Moines.
-Yeah.

539
00:44:05,395 --> 00:44:06,396
You had supper yet?

540
00:44:08,065 --> 00:44:10,317
I told you they were good.

541
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,986
I could eat like three of these things
in high school.

542
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:16,532
-So, where did you go to school?
-University of Iowa Law.

543
00:44:16,615 --> 00:44:19,284
-Where'd you go to school?
-Luther College.

544
00:44:19,368 --> 00:44:23,288
It's in Decorah. Division Three school.

545
00:44:23,997 --> 00:44:27,000
-So, you didn't grow up here.
-No.

546
00:44:27,042 --> 00:44:31,505
What is the big deal with the high school
baseball team? I don't get it.

547
00:44:31,547 --> 00:44:35,509
Well, here's the thing
you have to understand about Norway.

548
00:44:35,592 --> 00:44:37,845
It's like being with the New York Yankees.

549
00:44:37,886 --> 00:44:43,976
I mean, they have a tradition here
that's about more than just winning.

550
00:44:44,017 --> 00:44:46,478
It's about playing the game right.

551
00:44:50,149 --> 00:44:53,360
I guess I just want some of that
to rub off on me.

552
00:44:54,069 --> 00:44:56,113
Does that make any sense?

553
00:44:58,407 --> 00:45:00,576
This isn't going to work, you know.

554
00:45:00,659 --> 00:45:03,871
-What's not going to work?
-You trying to soften me up.

555
00:45:06,582 --> 00:45:08,208
Well, we'll see.

556
00:45:08,834 --> 00:45:11,086
Here we go, here we go, boy.
Here we go, Billy.

557
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:12,504
Atta boy, Billy.

558
00:45:12,588 --> 00:45:15,716
Strike him out, strike him out.
Hey, batter, batter, swing!

559
00:45:16,133 --> 00:45:18,093
Hey, batter, batter, batter, batter!

560
00:45:18,135 --> 00:45:20,721
Hey, batter, swing!

561
00:45:22,389 --> 00:45:24,766
-That's weak.
-Norway game?

562
00:45:24,850 --> 00:45:26,602
Yeah, a little game called fast rubber.

563
00:45:26,685 --> 00:45:28,604
-Yeah? Who's next?
-You can go.

564
00:45:28,729 --> 00:45:29,897
-Yeah?
-You want to play?

565
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:31,231
-You don't mind?
-No. Sure, sure.

566
00:45:31,315 --> 00:45:33,609
Go right in? You want it?

567
00:45:33,692 --> 00:45:35,694
I got the ball. I'm pitching.

568
00:45:35,777 --> 00:45:37,571
Look out, here he goes.

569
00:45:39,198 --> 00:45:40,657
A little rust.

570
00:45:40,741 --> 00:45:43,911
-Get him, Patrick.
-All right.

571
00:45:47,122 --> 00:45:48,290
Give me the ball, give me the ball.

572
00:45:48,373 --> 00:45:50,292
All right, here we go.
Too fast for you, too fast?

573
00:45:50,334 --> 00:45:53,712
-You get two more.
-Here we go, here we go, boy.

574
00:45:57,966 --> 00:45:59,927
One more. Let's go. He held on to it.

575
00:45:59,968 --> 00:46:01,428
Hey, whip some more... I got to feel it.

576
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:04,306
-You swing like a girl.
-One more.

577
00:46:07,976 --> 00:46:10,812
-Come here.
-Yeah? Not as easy as it looks.

578
00:46:10,896 --> 00:46:12,606
There you go.

579
00:46:12,648 --> 00:46:15,275
-Good luck.
-Go ahead, fight dirty.

580
00:46:20,656 --> 00:46:22,449
Come on. Throw it right here.

581
00:46:22,491 --> 00:46:24,159
Come on, Patrick.

582
00:46:29,456 --> 00:46:31,667
That's chickenshit! Come on, city boy!

583
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:34,962
-Ball slipped. What? What's the problem?
-You're the problem!

584
00:46:35,045 --> 00:46:36,672
Don't even bother coming out for the team!

585
00:46:36,713 --> 00:46:37,756
-Oh, yeah?
-Yeah!

586
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:38,882
-Why not?
-That big-city crap

587
00:46:38,966 --> 00:46:39,967
-doesn't cut it around here!
-No?

588
00:46:40,050 --> 00:46:41,552
You'd get cut first day!

589
00:46:41,635 --> 00:46:44,513
Get off of me! Yeah, go back to Chicago!

590
00:46:44,972 --> 00:46:48,183
Hey, man, why don't you just
go get in your Jag and leave?

591
00:46:52,062 --> 00:46:53,772
Come on, have a cigarette and loosen up.

592
00:46:53,856 --> 00:46:57,734
Come on, let's go. Let's play. Who's up?

593
00:46:57,818 --> 00:46:59,153
Kevin's up.

594
00:46:59,945 --> 00:47:03,115
-Sir, it'd be the opportunity of a lifetime.
-You got that right.

595
00:47:03,198 --> 00:47:05,075
-Yeah.
-We'll let you know.

596
00:47:05,159 --> 00:47:06,869
Okay, thanks.

597
00:47:08,162 --> 00:47:12,124
-Volleyball, huh?
-Girls' volleyball, actually.

598
00:47:12,207 --> 00:47:14,042
Perfect.

599
00:47:14,334 --> 00:47:17,337
-See you. Hi.
-Hi.

600
00:47:17,421 --> 00:47:18,380
-Hi.
-Hi.

601
00:47:18,463 --> 00:47:19,715
You're...

602
00:47:22,050 --> 00:47:23,802
Cindy.

603
00:47:23,886 --> 00:47:26,096
-Cindy. Hi.
-Hi.

604
00:47:29,933 --> 00:47:34,688
So, I heard you and my brother
had some run-ins.

605
00:47:34,771 --> 00:47:36,732
-Who's your brother?
-Patrick.

606
00:47:36,773 --> 00:47:38,734
Patrick's your brother?

607
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,571
Four more years, you'll have one of these
of your own, all right?

608
00:47:42,613 --> 00:47:44,740
Yeah.

609
00:47:44,823 --> 00:47:47,242
He's on the baseball team, right?

610
00:47:51,455 --> 00:47:55,083
If you're a Norway baseball player,
you're a hometown hero.

611
00:47:59,004 --> 00:48:02,216
-All right, see you.
-Yeah, I'm Mitch.

612
00:48:03,967 --> 00:48:05,677
Yeah, I know.

613
00:48:05,802 --> 00:48:07,930
-Give me a high five.
-Hey, guys.

614
00:48:07,971 --> 00:48:09,806
-Hey.
-How's it going? We going to DQ?

615
00:48:09,848 --> 00:48:11,725
I don't know. You bringing him?

616
00:48:11,975 --> 00:48:16,063
Whatever happens,
you guys are staying in school.

617
00:48:16,355 --> 00:48:18,106
I could get a part-time job.

618
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:21,318
It's just not right that they're letting you go.

619
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,736
Hey, Coach.

620
00:48:22,820 --> 00:48:26,406
I'm Mitch.
I'm in your industrial arts class at school.

621
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:28,075
Yeah, I remember.

622
00:48:28,158 --> 00:48:32,871
I was just wondering if, maybe,
if we could talk in private.

623
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:39,294
Sure. This is my wife Sheryl.

624
00:48:39,378 --> 00:48:41,505
Hi. I'm Mitch Akers.

625
00:48:41,547 --> 00:48:43,340
-These are my kids, Chad.
-Hey.

626
00:48:43,382 --> 00:48:45,050
-How do you do?
-I'm Mitch, how are you?

627
00:48:45,133 --> 00:48:46,218
-Jean Marie.
-Hi.

628
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:47,719
-Hi.
-Nice to meet you.

629
00:48:47,803 --> 00:48:49,680
Come on inside.

630
00:48:58,730 --> 00:49:00,607
What's on your mind?

631
00:49:01,775 --> 00:49:04,862
I want to apologize

632
00:49:07,364 --> 00:49:08,615
for my...

633
00:49:13,662 --> 00:49:15,956
My grandma says I need a hobby.

634
00:49:19,126 --> 00:49:22,212
I had this kid once,

635
00:49:22,296 --> 00:49:26,925
I asked him to lay down a bunt.
A runner on second, nobody out.

636
00:49:27,009 --> 00:49:32,264
We're down one to Cedar Rapids,
big 4A school, top of the seventh.

637
00:49:33,974 --> 00:49:36,768
We get our runner to third,
clean-up hitter's on deck,

638
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:39,188
chances are we tie the game.

639
00:49:40,272 --> 00:49:42,566
Dude should totally bunt.

640
00:49:42,608 --> 00:49:45,027
He didn't. He swung away.

641
00:49:46,778 --> 00:49:48,906
-And you lost.
-Nope.

642
00:49:51,825 --> 00:49:54,453
"Dude" hit a two-run homer and we won.

643
00:49:56,872 --> 00:49:59,249
And I benched him the next game.

644
00:50:01,418 --> 00:50:05,339
Well, he pissed and moaned for a while,
but he got the message.

645
00:50:07,841 --> 00:50:10,093
Damn good player, your father.

646
00:50:12,638 --> 00:50:14,932
Good attitude, too, eventually.

647
00:50:21,980 --> 00:50:24,691
I want to go out for your baseball team.

648
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,904
I'm a pretty good catcher.

649
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:33,742
I'm not coaching at Norway anymore.

650
00:50:36,370 --> 00:50:40,040
You'll have to talk to
whoever the new coach is.

651
00:50:44,378 --> 00:50:45,504
Well,

652
00:50:46,547 --> 00:50:48,006
nice meeting you, ma'am.

653
00:50:48,048 --> 00:50:50,884
-I'll see you. Thanks, Coach.
-Yeah.

654
00:50:59,476 --> 00:51:01,478
It's okay to miss it.

655
00:51:01,895 --> 00:51:04,731
Be a whole lot easier if that field was

656
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,318
a thousand miles away.

657
00:51:12,698 --> 00:51:16,910
Well, Mr. Makepeace, that just about
wraps up my work here in Norway.

658
00:51:16,994 --> 00:51:19,079
Well, you did a heck of a job for us,
Miss Hudson.

659
00:51:19,163 --> 00:51:21,081
-Thank you very much.
-Thank you.

660
00:51:21,123 --> 00:51:25,085
And don't worry, we're taking steps
to deal with the nay-sayers.

661
00:51:25,586 --> 00:51:27,296
Sir, that's really none of my business.

662
00:51:27,379 --> 00:51:29,840
We're going to hire a coach who's going to
take the team down with him.

663
00:51:29,923 --> 00:51:31,717
Fall flat on his ass.

664
00:51:32,217 --> 00:51:35,971
Mr. Makepeace, there's a Ken Stock
here to see you

665
00:51:36,054 --> 00:51:39,766
for an appointment regarding
the baseball head coach position.

666
00:51:39,850 --> 00:51:42,477
-Well, I'll be going.
-No, no, no, hang around.

667
00:51:42,561 --> 00:51:45,147
This is going to be fun. Send him in.

668
00:51:50,861 --> 00:51:53,238
-Am I interrupting something?
-Not at all, Ken.

669
00:51:53,322 --> 00:51:55,782
It's actually Kent, like Clark.

670
00:51:56,867 --> 00:52:00,537
Well, Kent, congratulations,
we're giving you the coaching job.

671
00:52:02,498 --> 00:52:03,624
Great.

672
00:52:03,707 --> 00:52:06,376
I better get going. Thank you.

673
00:52:07,586 --> 00:52:11,256
We've decided our boys from Norway
deserve one final season.

674
00:52:11,340 --> 00:52:13,509
You know, to go out in style.

675
00:52:13,592 --> 00:52:17,137
-You're just the man to lead them.
-I hope so.

676
00:52:17,513 --> 00:52:20,557
-Sit down, sit down.
-Yeah.

677
00:52:32,152 --> 00:52:33,737
It's pretty old.

678
00:52:34,738 --> 00:52:36,740
It's twice your age, son.

679
00:52:38,075 --> 00:52:40,869
Coach Bernie Hutchinson gave it to me
when he moved on.

680
00:52:40,911 --> 00:52:43,705
Read the name scratched on the end there.

681
00:52:44,623 --> 00:52:45,833
Trosky.

682
00:52:47,376 --> 00:52:49,628
This is the bat that hit the ball
that hopped the train

683
00:52:49,711 --> 00:52:51,839
all the way to Chicago?

684
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:55,425
Hal gave it to Bernie, Bernie gave it to me

685
00:52:55,509 --> 00:52:57,678
and now I'm giving it to you.

686
00:52:58,929 --> 00:53:00,180
Coach, I can't accept that.

687
00:53:00,222 --> 00:53:01,807
No. You got to.

688
00:53:02,683 --> 00:53:06,311
Part of the tradition handed down
by the gods of baseball.

689
00:53:07,396 --> 00:53:09,731
You wouldn't want to piss them off,
would you?

690
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:11,733
No, sir. No, I wouldn't.

691
00:53:13,944 --> 00:53:18,115
Well, you take those kids
all the way, Coach.

692
00:53:20,450 --> 00:53:21,493
Yeah.

693
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:24,705
There it is. That's him.

694
00:53:25,664 --> 00:53:27,207
He played all right.

695
00:53:27,541 --> 00:53:30,544
He made the last out
in the championship game.

696
00:53:34,047 --> 00:53:36,258
-Great.
-Never won the big one.

697
00:53:38,051 --> 00:53:39,261
We're screwed.

698
00:54:00,449 --> 00:54:03,535
-What you got that thing set on?
-Vida Blue.

699
00:54:10,667 --> 00:54:14,755
-Where'd you learn to hit like that?
-My dad.

700
00:54:15,380 --> 00:54:18,008
What school you say you go to?

701
00:54:20,010 --> 00:54:21,803
-Norway.
-Excellent.

702
00:54:24,348 --> 00:54:26,600
I'm Kent Stock.

703
00:54:27,768 --> 00:54:29,937
Hi. Mitch Akers.

704
00:54:40,697 --> 00:54:42,449
Hi.

705
00:54:45,619 --> 00:54:48,539
-Hey, Chip.
-Hey, Coach.

706
00:54:49,581 --> 00:54:52,376
I was going to tell you about that.

707
00:54:59,591 --> 00:55:04,429
Look, we're missing a bunch of guys.
I was going to tell you about that, too.

708
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:10,352
Well, we'll play with what we have.
We're few but we're not bad.

709
00:55:10,435 --> 00:55:13,564
-Right.
-How the hell would you know?

710
00:55:13,647 --> 00:55:15,899
Somebody say something?

711
00:55:17,109 --> 00:55:19,111
Go on, speak up.

712
00:55:20,112 --> 00:55:23,407
Some of the guys think
you don't know what you're doing, Coach.

713
00:55:23,448 --> 00:55:25,742
-You included, Patrick?
-Coach Van Scoyoc would've gone pro

714
00:55:25,784 --> 00:55:27,828
if the army hadn't drafted him.

715
00:55:27,911 --> 00:55:30,956
Okay. I get it.

716
00:55:31,039 --> 00:55:33,709
Kevin, you're our number-one pitcher, right?

717
00:55:33,792 --> 00:55:35,919
I get three pitches. I hit one out,

718
00:55:35,961 --> 00:55:39,423
you shut up about me
and start focusing on yourselves.

719
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,926
There's no way you hit one out.

720
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:44,344
Do we have a deal?

721
00:55:44,428 --> 00:55:47,139
-Yeah, deal but...
-Let's do it.

722
00:55:48,390 --> 00:55:49,725
Owen, give me a bat.

723
00:55:49,808 --> 00:55:51,935
-All right, Kevin.
-Shut him down.

724
00:55:54,146 --> 00:55:57,191
All right, he's meat, Kevin. Bring it!

725
00:55:57,274 --> 00:56:00,360
-Here we go, Kevin.
-Give him something hard.

726
00:56:03,572 --> 00:56:06,492
Give me the heat, let's go. I'm not kidding.

727
00:56:06,533 --> 00:56:10,579
All right, Kevin, no puss. Bring it. I mean it.

728
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:19,796
You only get two more.

729
00:56:21,131 --> 00:56:23,008
Come on, Kevin.

730
00:56:24,885 --> 00:56:26,678
Come on.

731
00:56:35,145 --> 00:56:36,563
No.

732
00:56:41,235 --> 00:56:44,238
Okay, Kevin, bring it in.

733
00:56:44,279 --> 00:56:46,073
Come on, guys.

734
00:56:49,952 --> 00:56:52,371
Lose the volleyballs.

735
00:56:52,454 --> 00:56:54,706
-Told you it was a bad idea.
-Whatever.

736
00:56:54,748 --> 00:56:58,293
Chip! Outfield!
The rest of you guys will take some infield.

737
00:56:58,377 --> 00:57:00,921
-Sammy, shag for me.
-Infield, boys. Infield!

738
00:57:01,004 --> 00:57:02,214
Coach.

739
00:57:02,256 --> 00:57:05,592
-Owen, Fungoe, come on, buddy!
-You want me to catch?

740
00:57:05,676 --> 00:57:09,513
-No, Steve's got it.
-Don't I get a shot?

741
00:57:09,596 --> 00:57:12,558
What we need is outfielders now, all right?
Go ahead and take center.

742
00:57:12,641 --> 00:57:14,768
-Way to go, Coach.
-Thank you.

743
00:57:14,852 --> 00:57:17,646
Mitch, remember I need your bat
in the lineup, so don't hang your head.

744
00:57:17,729 --> 00:57:19,857
Let's go. Sammy, shagging balls, atta boy.

745
00:57:19,940 --> 00:57:20,941
Yes, sir, Coach.

746
00:57:21,024 --> 00:57:22,484
Let's go, let's get one.

747
00:57:23,861 --> 00:57:26,530
All I'm saying is a T-ball player
has a better chance

748
00:57:26,613 --> 00:57:30,951
of hitting a Nolan Ryan fastball
than our boys have of going to state.

749
00:57:30,993 --> 00:57:34,830
Jim says that Stock kid's bright as a Musco.

750
00:57:34,913 --> 00:57:38,375
I say what we need is a coach,
not a big light.

751
00:57:38,458 --> 00:57:41,128
Never going to be the way it used to be
around here.

752
00:57:41,211 --> 00:57:43,005
-Hey, Patrick!
-Hey.

753
00:57:43,088 --> 00:57:44,464
-Have a seat.
-All right, then.

754
00:57:44,506 --> 00:57:46,633
-It won't take long.
-Okay.

755
00:57:46,717 --> 00:57:51,513
Just want you to know that nobody expects
you guys to win anything this year.

756
00:57:51,597 --> 00:57:54,600
Not with Tyler and Jim gone,
and half the boys not coming out.

757
00:57:54,683 --> 00:57:58,479
-So don't sweat it.
-Okay. Great.

758
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,066
Thanks, Scotty.

759
00:58:03,817 --> 00:58:05,611
Patrick...

760
00:58:06,945 --> 00:58:09,114
Well, am I wrong? Things change.

761
00:58:09,156 --> 00:58:12,868
Well, I'm surprised
at a lot of people in this town.

762
00:58:12,951 --> 00:58:16,663
We have so little faith in these boys
who have meant so much to us.

763
00:58:16,705 --> 00:58:21,543
Well, you think it'd help if we all said
a prayer for them at church?

764
00:58:21,627 --> 00:58:24,963
A good prayer is fine,
but there's got to be a little action with it.

765
00:58:25,047 --> 00:58:29,176
You know, it wouldn't hurt
if you started coming back to practices.

766
00:58:32,763 --> 00:58:35,182
Let's go, Eddie, bring it home!

767
00:58:35,224 --> 00:58:36,934
Get there, come on!

768
00:58:39,645 --> 00:58:43,315
Keep it down!
Get those throws down, come on, fellows!

769
00:58:47,736 --> 00:58:50,823
Come on, Spitz!
Know where you're going with it!

770
00:58:53,325 --> 00:58:56,370
Sammy, back him up! Come on!

771
00:58:56,411 --> 00:58:59,623
That's you, that's you! Get there!

772
00:58:59,706 --> 00:59:01,583
Let's go, bring it in!

773
00:59:09,591 --> 00:59:11,927
What is going on?

774
00:59:12,010 --> 00:59:14,221
I mean, what's with you guys?

775
00:59:14,304 --> 00:59:16,390
Stands used to be filled when we practiced.

776
00:59:16,431 --> 00:59:19,810
Yeah, now all we got is that stalker guy.

777
00:59:20,477 --> 00:59:23,230
It's okay, I'm married!

778
00:59:24,273 --> 00:59:26,483
He's a reporter for the Des Moines paper.

779
00:59:26,567 --> 00:59:28,819
And he's bald,
that's why he wears his little hat.

780
00:59:28,902 --> 00:59:31,989
All right.
Thinks we're going to fall flat on our asses.

781
00:59:32,072 --> 00:59:33,699
Butts. Sorry, Coach.

782
00:59:33,782 --> 00:59:35,909
-Even Coach Van Scoyoc thinks that.
-No, he doesn't.

783
00:59:35,993 --> 00:59:37,619
Yeah, shut up, Sam.

784
00:59:37,703 --> 00:59:40,956
Coach Van Scoyoc took one for the team
so we could all play one final season.

785
00:59:41,039 --> 00:59:42,791
All right, listen up.

786
00:59:42,875 --> 00:59:46,879
We decide what happens out here, all right?
Not the papers, not the people in town.

787
00:59:46,962 --> 00:59:50,090
I don't want to hear one more word
about Madison and the merger.

788
00:59:50,132 --> 00:59:52,301
We're going to play Norway baseball.

789
00:59:52,384 --> 00:59:55,637
Van Scoyoc baseball,
Bernie Hutchinson baseball.

790
00:59:55,721 --> 00:59:59,141
We do that, no matter what happens,
we go out winners.

791
00:59:59,224 --> 01:00:00,601
You got it?

792
01:00:02,769 --> 01:00:04,521
-You got it?
-Yeah.

793
01:00:04,605 --> 01:00:08,442
Well, good! Get out there
and let's run it again. Come on!

794
01:00:09,860 --> 01:00:10,903
All right.

795
01:00:10,986 --> 01:00:12,529
-Ciao, Coach.
-Thanks.

796
01:00:14,031 --> 01:00:15,491
-See you, Coach.
-See you.

797
01:00:15,532 --> 01:00:17,576
-Hey, sorry, Coach.
-For what?

798
01:00:17,659 --> 01:00:20,078
-The volleyball thing.
-Get out of here.

799
01:00:20,162 --> 01:00:21,997
-See you tomorrow.
-Pretty funny.

800
01:00:22,080 --> 01:00:24,166
It's not that funny, but it's pretty funny.

801
01:00:24,208 --> 01:00:26,668
-Here, take that.
-Thanks, Coach.

802
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:29,588
-Looks like they're warming up to you.
-Yeah.

803
01:00:33,217 --> 01:00:36,803
First game's Friday.
If they play like they practiced, we're dead.

804
01:00:36,887 --> 01:00:38,931
I guess we're going to have to call it.

805
01:00:39,014 --> 01:00:41,391
We can't play in this.

806
01:00:41,475 --> 01:00:43,769
Thanks, guys.

807
01:00:43,852 --> 01:00:44,937
Well, we're back out here tomorrow

808
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:49,149
against Cedar Rapids Kennedy,
so get home and get some sleep.

809
01:00:49,650 --> 01:00:51,568
I'm going to get a beer.

810
01:00:51,610 --> 01:00:52,945
Want to come over and watch the game?

811
01:00:53,028 --> 01:00:55,906
-No, I'll see you tomorrow.
-All right.

812
01:00:55,989 --> 01:00:59,451
Good for the corn.
Roger Dempsey, Des Moines Register.

813
01:00:59,535 --> 01:01:02,079
Yeah, I've read
some of your complimentary articles.

814
01:01:02,162 --> 01:01:05,082
Take it easy, Coach. This is what I do.

815
01:01:05,123 --> 01:01:08,085
Well, what I do is get my players
over some of the bad-mouthing

816
01:01:08,126 --> 01:01:09,753
they've been getting from guys like you.

817
01:01:09,837 --> 01:01:12,631
You know, so they can play a little baseball
for their high school

818
01:01:12,714 --> 01:01:16,510
before going out into the real world
and getting crummy jobs like yours.

819
01:01:16,593 --> 01:01:19,054
We're being honest, huh?
Well, let me tell you something,

820
01:01:19,096 --> 01:01:24,226
I have the best job in America.
I can't play baseball, so I write about it.

821
01:01:24,309 --> 01:01:27,396
And you may not like it,
but it's always honest.

822
01:01:28,230 --> 01:01:29,606
Okay.

823
01:01:29,648 --> 01:01:32,901
We'll pick it up again tomorrow.
Because I love this. This is terrific.

824
01:01:32,943 --> 01:01:35,946
But I got to get back to the office now.
My crummy job.

825
01:01:36,029 --> 01:01:38,282
I've even got the lead for tomorrow,
what do you think?

826
01:01:38,323 --> 01:01:42,619
"Cub Coach Kent Stock Irritates
The Voice of Norway."

827
01:01:43,996 --> 01:01:47,583
-Not bad. Keep working on it.
-You, too.

828
01:01:57,926 --> 01:01:58,927
Hey there.

829
01:01:59,011 --> 01:02:00,637
-Hi.
-Come on in.

830
01:02:00,679 --> 01:02:03,223
Just for a minute.

831
01:02:07,311 --> 01:02:10,564
From the bridge. Free.

832
01:02:12,566 --> 01:02:14,318
Well, that's sweet.

833
01:02:14,401 --> 01:02:16,403
I came out here to tell you
that you were right.

834
01:02:16,487 --> 01:02:19,781
Those smaller schools
that were absorbed by larger districts?

835
01:02:19,865 --> 01:02:24,036
Their economies were absorbed, too.
They're turning into ghost towns.

836
01:02:24,119 --> 01:02:26,205
Well, did you talk to
the Norway school board about it?

837
01:02:26,288 --> 01:02:27,456
-Yes.
-And?

838
01:02:27,539 --> 01:02:32,419
Mr. Makepeace is not interested in statistics
that don't support his position.

839
01:02:32,503 --> 01:02:35,506
-And he pretty much controls the board.
-Yeah.

840
01:02:36,632 --> 01:02:38,258
-I'm sorry.
-No...

841
01:02:39,384 --> 01:02:42,179
-Listen, you want to come in and sit down?
-I should go.

842
01:02:42,221 --> 01:02:44,556
But good luck tomorrow.

843
01:02:44,598 --> 01:02:48,185
-With what?
-The game. Cedar Rapids Kennedy.

844
01:02:48,268 --> 01:02:50,854
You know about that?
How'd you know about that?

845
01:02:50,896 --> 01:02:53,148
Baseball's not just for boys.

846
01:02:53,982 --> 01:02:57,110
Hey, wait! Can I get your number?

847
01:02:57,194 --> 01:02:59,071
I wrote it on the bag.

848
01:03:13,377 --> 01:03:16,755
-Hello?
-Coach Hinkleman? It's Kent Stock here.

849
01:03:16,797 --> 01:03:19,842
-Hi, Kent.
-It's really pouring.

850
01:03:19,925 --> 01:03:23,011
We got clear skies here.
Our field's ready to go.

851
01:03:23,095 --> 01:03:25,055
Well, it was supposed to be
a home game but...

852
01:03:25,138 --> 01:03:29,309
You don't want to call your first two games
right out of the chute, do you, kid?

853
01:03:29,393 --> 01:03:30,394
No.

854
01:03:31,645 --> 01:03:34,398
I didn't think so.
Why don't you load up and come on over?

855
01:03:34,815 --> 01:03:38,527
Hey, Larry Johnson, Madison Star Press.

856
01:03:38,610 --> 01:03:41,405
I got permission to ride with the team.

857
01:03:41,488 --> 01:03:44,408
-Okay with you?
-Hey, L.J.!

858
01:03:44,491 --> 01:03:47,494
No, not him, please.

859
01:03:47,536 --> 01:03:50,998
-Sure.
-Come on in.

860
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,583
Thank you.

861
01:03:52,666 --> 01:03:54,585
Hi, Roger. Wet enough for you?

862
01:03:54,668 --> 01:03:56,378
Good to see you. Been a while. How's...

863
01:03:56,461 --> 01:03:57,921
-Lucy.
-Yeah.

864
01:03:58,046 --> 01:03:59,756
Fine. How's...

865
01:03:59,882 --> 01:04:01,341
-Eileen.
-Yeah.

866
01:04:01,425 --> 01:04:02,676
Fine.

867
01:04:06,388 --> 01:04:07,681
Okay, let's go.

868
01:04:15,522 --> 01:04:18,609
Team seems pretty loose for their first game.

869
01:04:18,692 --> 01:04:23,030
Most of these kids have already put in
a full day's work at their farm.

870
01:04:25,199 --> 01:04:28,243
Still milking that underdog angle, eh?

871
01:04:31,371 --> 01:04:32,873
-Nice to meet you, Kent.
-You, too, Coach.

872
01:04:32,915 --> 01:04:35,501
You got some beautiful weather here.
Not a drop of rain in sight.

873
01:04:35,584 --> 01:04:39,004
Right. We'll take some infield then.

874
01:04:39,087 --> 01:04:41,381
Coach?

875
01:04:41,423 --> 01:04:45,010
Do you mind if my kids take infield first?
They're a little sleepy from the drive over.

876
01:04:45,135 --> 01:04:48,138
I'd love to wake them up
so we can give you some good competition.

877
01:04:48,222 --> 01:04:50,849
Pretty standard,
home team takes infield first.

878
01:04:50,933 --> 01:04:55,896
Yeah, would have been our home game,
except for the rain and all.

879
01:04:55,979 --> 01:05:00,442
-Okay, I guess.
-Thanks, Coach. Won't take long.

880
01:05:04,196 --> 01:05:06,990
-Let's go.
-Infield!

881
01:05:07,866 --> 01:05:10,953
Nice and crisp, boys! Nice and crisp!

882
01:05:49,116 --> 01:05:50,659
-Dude.
-Huh?

883
01:05:50,701 --> 01:05:52,911
Thought they lost all their good players.

884
01:05:52,995 --> 01:05:55,455
It looks like they found some more.

885
01:06:27,738 --> 01:06:28,780
Last one.

886
01:06:31,325 --> 01:06:32,493
Atta boy.

887
01:06:32,576 --> 01:06:34,703
All yours, Coach.

888
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:37,581
Eight minutes, 50 seconds.

889
01:06:39,875 --> 01:06:42,294
That ought to get in their heads
and rattle around a little bit.

890
01:06:42,377 --> 01:06:43,879
Get out there!

891
01:06:54,556 --> 01:06:55,682
Come on, yeah!

892
01:07:18,455 --> 01:07:19,957
-Strike three!
-Yeah!

893
01:07:33,637 --> 01:07:35,305
Come on, get there!

894
01:07:35,389 --> 01:07:38,225
Come on! Keep your head in the play!

895
01:07:54,283 --> 01:07:56,785
Sit down and shut up!

896
01:07:57,202 --> 01:08:00,372
That is the absolute worst
I've ever seen this team play!

897
01:08:00,414 --> 01:08:03,959
The Sixth Commandment of baseball,
don't alibi on the bad hops!

898
01:08:04,042 --> 01:08:05,586
Anyone can make the easy play!

899
01:08:05,669 --> 01:08:08,589
How do we give four unearned runs
in one inning?

900
01:08:08,672 --> 01:08:10,465
I said give me some
heads up base running!

901
01:08:10,549 --> 01:08:12,467
You gave me
head-up-your-ass base running!

902
01:08:12,551 --> 01:08:15,220
We got picked off three times!

903
01:08:15,262 --> 01:08:17,890
You guys are going to blow
your final season!

904
01:08:17,973 --> 01:08:19,016
Is that what you want?

905
01:08:19,099 --> 01:08:21,518
Do you know who's sitting up in the stands
writing about you right now?

906
01:08:21,602 --> 01:08:23,562
What do you want him to say?

907
01:08:23,604 --> 01:08:26,231
Use your heads! Show up and play ball,

908
01:08:26,273 --> 01:08:28,025
or don't show up at all!

909
01:08:28,567 --> 01:08:29,610
All right, guys.

910
01:08:30,444 --> 01:08:34,573
Just don't rush your balance point here.
Just stay long, it's going to work you.

911
01:08:35,949 --> 01:08:38,410
-That's it.
-Hey, Coach.

912
01:08:38,452 --> 01:08:42,247
You seen this crap?
They're ragging on your boys.

913
01:08:51,632 --> 01:08:54,593
When I was a kid,
Jim Van Scoyoc was my hero.

914
01:08:54,635 --> 01:08:58,096
I mean, I wanted to play ball for him.
I wanted to learn from him.

915
01:08:58,180 --> 01:09:01,183
I never thought in a million years
that I would replace him.

916
01:09:01,266 --> 01:09:05,437
And now that I have,
I can't motivate the team the way he did.

917
01:09:06,563 --> 01:09:09,191
He's a legend. You know, I mean, he...

918
01:09:09,274 --> 01:09:10,567
Twelve state championships.

919
01:09:10,651 --> 01:09:13,779
Coach of the year.
National coach of the year.

920
01:09:14,780 --> 01:09:18,033
I was his assistant coach for a half season.

921
01:09:18,992 --> 01:09:21,745
And I can never fill his shoes.

922
01:09:21,829 --> 01:09:23,705
So quit.

923
01:09:23,789 --> 01:09:27,501
-No, it's not about quitting. It's about...
-Kidding, joke.

924
01:09:28,752 --> 01:09:30,671
Listen to me.

925
01:09:30,712 --> 01:09:34,132
You don't have it in you
to let those kids down.

926
01:09:34,675 --> 01:09:36,051
You don't.

927
01:09:36,510 --> 01:09:39,388
Just concentrate on filling your own shoes.

928
01:09:40,347 --> 01:09:45,894
"You will never become a.300-hitter
unless you take the bat off your shoulder."

929
01:09:48,397 --> 01:09:49,982
Casey Stengel.

930
01:09:50,274 --> 01:09:52,734
Chief Bender.
Played for the Philadelphia Athletics

931
01:09:52,818 --> 01:09:54,820
about a hundred years ago.

932
01:09:59,741 --> 01:10:00,701
I knew that.

933
01:10:03,162 --> 01:10:05,455
Come on, Sammy. Throw a strike.

934
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:20,721
That's what I'm talking about! Yeah!

935
01:10:20,762 --> 01:10:22,473
-Yeah!
-I got it.

936
01:10:29,062 --> 01:10:30,439
Time, blue!

937
01:10:35,152 --> 01:10:38,697
-What was that garbage?
-Like we're going to win anyway.

938
01:10:39,531 --> 01:10:41,950
Who cares? We won the first game.

939
01:10:43,827 --> 01:10:45,913
-He's a little off today, Coach.
-No, he's not.

940
01:10:45,996 --> 01:10:47,956
You do that one more time,
you're out of here.

941
01:10:47,998 --> 01:10:49,583
You understand?

942
01:10:50,292 --> 01:10:53,420
You fight for it.
I don't care what the score is.

943
01:10:54,338 --> 01:10:55,923
Let's go.

944
01:10:57,966 --> 01:11:00,844
All right, look alive, Norway! Two down!

945
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:11,396
-All right, let's go, two down, Norway!
-Here we go, Sammy! Pick it up!

946
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:13,816
Let's get this guy!

947
01:11:29,456 --> 01:11:32,376
-Time, blue!
-I got it, Coach. Come on, Big-O.

948
01:11:34,211 --> 01:11:36,046
You all right? This hand?

949
01:11:36,129 --> 01:11:39,967
-Right there...
-All right, all right, let's get some ice on it.

950
01:11:43,136 --> 01:11:45,013
You're done, sit down.

951
01:11:46,932 --> 01:11:48,642
Cold, keep the swelling down.

952
01:11:48,725 --> 01:11:51,228
-We're going to get an x-ray. All right.
-Nice pitch, idiot!

953
01:11:51,311 --> 01:11:53,188
Mitch, get on the gear.

954
01:11:53,939 --> 01:11:56,150
Okay, two down. Get this guy.

955
01:11:57,734 --> 01:12:00,070
-Bad pitch.
-The worst.

956
01:12:01,947 --> 01:12:04,992
Driscoll, get third base.

957
01:12:07,244 --> 01:12:09,955
-All right, I got to get this off you.
-How's it look?

958
01:12:10,038 --> 01:12:12,916
Not good, Coach. It's swelling up bad.

959
01:12:16,879 --> 01:12:20,382
All right, here we go, Norway, here we go!
Two down! Two down!

960
01:12:20,424 --> 01:12:23,010
Three strikes, buy you a pack of cigarettes.

961
01:12:23,093 --> 01:12:25,429
-I don't smoke.
-Six-pack.

962
01:12:26,096 --> 01:12:28,015
-Done.
-Atta boy.

963
01:12:28,765 --> 01:12:30,434
Let's go, Kevin.

964
01:12:36,857 --> 01:12:38,609
Strike!

965
01:12:39,193 --> 01:12:41,069
Strike!

966
01:12:43,906 --> 01:12:45,616
-Three!
-Yes!

967
01:12:45,657 --> 01:12:49,870
Hey, slugger, don't worry about it.
I heard he hunts rabbits with those things.

968
01:13:14,394 --> 01:13:16,063
Bus is moving. What are you doing, guys?

969
01:13:16,146 --> 01:13:18,232
Sit down.

970
01:13:21,735 --> 01:13:24,154
Hold him! Hold him down!
Hold him down! Sammy!

971
01:13:24,238 --> 01:13:26,365
You don't want to be on this team?
Then quit!

972
01:13:26,448 --> 01:13:28,492
But don't you ever quit in a game!
You got it?

973
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:31,119
Face it, Patrick, it doesn't matter!

974
01:13:32,371 --> 01:13:35,123
Hey! Be part of the team or get off of it!

975
01:13:35,207 --> 01:13:37,501
Sit down and shut up!

976
01:13:47,761 --> 01:13:48,804
Pop!

977
01:13:48,887 --> 01:13:51,598
-My chest is burning!
-All right, I need my two fastest runners!

978
01:13:51,682 --> 01:13:55,644
-Go! Go!
-Mitch, go, go, go, go!

979
01:13:57,020 --> 01:14:00,357
Run, run, run, run!

980
01:14:09,366 --> 01:14:11,577
This don't look good.

981
01:14:14,621 --> 01:14:17,416
So what's the good word there, darling?

982
01:14:18,792 --> 01:14:20,627
No more driving the bus.

983
01:14:20,711 --> 01:14:23,589
No more beer. No more cigars.

984
01:14:25,340 --> 01:14:28,886
And I'm sorry, boys. No more baseball.

985
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:39,605
Jim, come here, do me a favor.

986
01:14:41,106 --> 01:14:43,108
You just name it, buddy.

987
01:14:44,026 --> 01:14:46,612
Reach over there and pull that plug for me,
would you?

988
01:14:46,695 --> 01:14:47,946
For real?

989
01:15:17,392 --> 01:15:19,520
What do you want?

990
01:15:21,688 --> 01:15:24,191
I came to see Cindy.

991
01:15:25,275 --> 01:15:28,529
-Is she around?
-I'm still on the fence about you, Akers.

992
01:15:49,383 --> 01:15:52,052
-Hi.
-Hi.

993
01:15:53,554 --> 01:15:56,140
I came to see you.

994
01:15:56,223 --> 01:15:59,393
-I can see that.
-Yeah, well...

995
01:16:00,602 --> 01:16:04,898
I'm going to visit my grandma.
Come along if you want.

996
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:06,817
-All right.
-Just hop on.

997
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:08,569
-Hop on?
-Yeah.

998
01:16:08,652 --> 01:16:10,612
All right, hold on.

999
01:16:16,910 --> 01:16:19,246
Oh, are you okay?

1000
01:16:19,329 --> 01:16:20,873
I meant to do that.

1001
01:16:20,914 --> 01:16:23,041
Really? Are you okay?

1002
01:16:25,169 --> 01:16:26,587
I'll walk.

1003
01:16:28,463 --> 01:16:30,257
Come on, Duke.

1004
01:16:39,766 --> 01:16:42,227
Hey, come here.

1005
01:17:00,704 --> 01:17:02,623
My mom died a year ago.

1006
01:17:03,749 --> 01:17:05,125
I'm sorry.

1007
01:17:08,337 --> 01:17:10,839
She's buried in Chicago.

1008
01:17:10,881 --> 01:17:14,176
And ever since then,
me and my dad have had trouble.

1009
01:17:16,595 --> 01:17:18,555
It's mostly me, I guess.

1010
01:17:34,154 --> 01:17:36,865
Let me ask you something, Sammy.
Few big games coming up next week.

1011
01:17:36,949 --> 01:17:39,993
A little thin in the pitching department,
aren't you?

1012
01:17:40,077 --> 01:17:43,622
You're a little thin in the hair department,
aren't you?

1013
01:17:46,291 --> 01:17:47,501
Well...

1014
01:17:52,422 --> 01:17:55,843
Hey, Akers, you're from the big city.
Help me out a little here.

1015
01:17:55,884 --> 01:17:59,054
In your own words, what would you say
the difference is between

1016
01:17:59,138 --> 01:18:01,557
Norway baseball and Chicago baseball?

1017
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:02,808
You got a cigarette?

1018
01:18:02,891 --> 01:18:05,727
That's great, very funny. You're good.

1019
01:18:05,811 --> 01:18:07,396
-You're bald.
-All right!

1020
01:18:07,479 --> 01:18:11,733
That's it! I'm bald, okay?
Anyone not know I'm bald?

1021
01:18:11,817 --> 01:18:14,945
Why don't we all just say,
"Roger Dempsey's bald,

1022
01:18:15,028 --> 01:18:17,823
"and we're not." Yet!

1023
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:21,326
Yeah, right.

1024
01:18:22,369 --> 01:18:25,998
Yeah, yeah. Kids, huh?

1025
01:18:26,081 --> 01:18:29,585
What are you so glum about? You're 17
and 12. That's pretty good, considering.

1026
01:18:29,668 --> 01:18:31,461
Thought you always called 'em
like you saw 'em?

1027
01:18:31,545 --> 01:18:33,255
As I saw them. But never mind that now.

1028
01:18:33,338 --> 01:18:35,757
Look, I was a little hard on you
in the beginning.

1029
01:18:35,799 --> 01:18:39,219
But I'll be honest with you, I think
you have a shot at the state tournament.

1030
01:18:39,303 --> 01:18:41,763
-Off the record?
-Sure.

1031
01:18:41,847 --> 01:18:45,184
We have tired pitching and sloppy defense.

1032
01:18:45,267 --> 01:18:48,520
Coach, they always hit a patch like this
every year.

1033
01:18:48,604 --> 01:18:51,231
But you know what? Coach Van Scoyoc
would ease up on them a little.

1034
01:18:51,315 --> 01:18:52,441
-You've been talking to him?
-No.

1035
01:18:52,524 --> 01:18:57,446
But Coach Van Scoyoc always stopped
riding them so hard.

1036
01:18:57,488 --> 01:18:58,864
-You've been talking to him?
-No.

1037
01:18:58,947 --> 01:19:00,532
The team he's coaching is coming in

1038
01:19:00,616 --> 01:19:03,785
on a 35-year-old consecutive
scoreless innings record.

1039
01:19:03,869 --> 01:19:06,663
So, that's all.

1040
01:19:06,747 --> 01:19:10,667
-So you've been talking to him?
-Yes. For that story.

1041
01:19:10,751 --> 01:19:12,294
-You talk to him about me?
-No.

1042
01:19:12,377 --> 01:19:16,048
But he's very proud of you
and thinks you're doing a great job.

1043
01:19:16,131 --> 01:19:19,718
-You didn't talk to him about me?
-Of course I have.

1044
01:19:19,802 --> 01:19:22,971
You'd make a pretty good reporter yourself.
You know what?

1045
01:19:23,013 --> 01:19:26,642
He says you'll know exactly
what you have to do.

1046
01:19:26,683 --> 01:19:27,976
What's that, Roger?

1047
01:19:28,018 --> 01:19:30,854
You gotta coach to win that last game,
the big one.

1048
01:19:30,896 --> 01:19:33,524
Took the words right out of my mouth.

1049
01:19:33,607 --> 01:19:35,025
Gotta get there first, Chip.

1050
01:19:35,067 --> 01:19:36,360
You will.

1051
01:19:38,070 --> 01:19:39,613
Thanks, Roger.

1052
01:19:45,118 --> 01:19:47,037
-Excuse me, Mr. Dempsey?
-Yeah, son?

1053
01:19:47,120 --> 01:19:50,541
It's okay, my grandpa was bald, too.

1054
01:19:50,582 --> 01:19:53,252
Thanks.

1055
01:19:53,335 --> 01:19:55,921
But you're fatter.

1056
01:19:56,004 --> 01:19:57,256
Oh, boy.

1057
01:19:57,756 --> 01:20:01,802
Tonight's the night Norway fans kiss
high school baseball goodbye.

1058
01:20:01,885 --> 01:20:05,264
Everybody plays it here
and you just can't turn it down.

1059
01:20:05,347 --> 01:20:09,893
It's been a tradition here in Norway for
as long as I can remember.

1060
01:20:09,977 --> 01:20:11,812
And that's pretty near 70 years.

1061
01:20:11,895 --> 01:20:17,276
Alex's wife, Dolly, understands as well as
anyone what the Tigers mean to the town.

1062
01:20:17,317 --> 01:20:20,487
Baseball is Norway. Or Norway is baseball.

1063
01:20:20,571 --> 01:20:22,281
It's sad for the town.

1064
01:20:22,990 --> 01:20:26,660
Okay. Next week we go to sectionals.

1065
01:20:26,743 --> 01:20:28,412
If we can knock off Jefferson today,

1066
01:20:28,495 --> 01:20:32,958
the number-one ranked 4A team
from a school ten times our size,

1067
01:20:33,000 --> 01:20:37,546
we send a message to all the other schools,
Norway isn't dead.

1068
01:20:37,629 --> 01:20:42,718
Now, I know you guys realize this
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

1069
01:20:42,801 --> 01:20:46,638
This is the last regular season game
in this school's history.

1070
01:20:49,892 --> 01:20:52,311
Let's make it count. Bring it in.

1071
01:20:54,271 --> 01:20:55,647
"Tigers" on three. One, two, three!

1072
01:20:55,689 --> 01:20:56,732
-Tigers!
-Let's go!

1073
01:20:59,651 --> 01:21:01,695
You know what? I've got one of those
baseball feelings, though.

1074
01:21:01,778 --> 01:21:04,031
I think Norway's coming back.

1075
01:21:04,114 --> 01:21:07,326
Would this be like a whiskey feeling
or more of a vodka feeling?

1076
01:21:07,367 --> 01:21:10,078
You know what? You're biased, Larry.
You're from Madison, come to think of it.

1077
01:21:10,162 --> 01:21:12,789
You want Norway to lose. If they don't lose,
you have a problem next season.

1078
01:21:12,873 --> 01:21:13,957
I know who you are.

1079
01:21:14,041 --> 01:21:15,751
And you're not biased?

1080
01:21:15,834 --> 01:21:18,754
I'm from the big city, buddy.
Des Moines, all right?

1081
01:21:18,837 --> 01:21:21,298
I don't have a horse in this...
I don't care who wins this game.

1082
01:21:21,381 --> 01:21:23,675
All right, big city.
20 gets your 40 Norway loses.

1083
01:21:23,759 --> 01:21:25,928
-Oh, I'm so gonna bet.
-All right.

1084
01:21:26,011 --> 01:21:27,387
-You want a piece of this, Father?
-Stop it.

1085
01:21:27,471 --> 01:21:31,558
-Come on, guys, it's not too late!
-It's rally time!

1086
01:21:34,812 --> 01:21:37,856
Pitcher's got nothin'!

1087
01:21:41,443 --> 01:21:43,695
Don't ever do this.

1088
01:21:43,737 --> 01:21:45,405
Mitch, be a hero.

1089
01:22:00,379 --> 01:22:02,631
Go! Go, go, go, go!

1090
01:22:02,714 --> 01:22:04,758
Come on, Mitch!

1091
01:22:04,842 --> 01:22:06,385
You gotta be down! You gotta be down!

1092
01:22:06,426 --> 01:22:09,054
You gotta be down! You gotta be down!

1093
01:22:15,561 --> 01:22:16,562
Safe!

1094
01:22:23,777 --> 01:22:25,737
-Welcome to Norway, son.
-Thanks, Coach.

1095
01:22:36,790 --> 01:22:39,001
Let's go, take a look!

1096
01:22:39,084 --> 01:22:40,169
Okay.

1097
01:22:45,841 --> 01:22:48,135
You got one more.

1098
01:22:52,222 --> 01:22:53,223
Here you go.

1099
01:23:01,648 --> 01:23:02,900
Go!

1100
01:23:15,078 --> 01:23:16,079
Yeah!

1101
01:23:17,789 --> 01:23:20,709
Hey, hey!
Doesn't mean I want to be related to you.

1102
01:23:20,792 --> 01:23:22,294
Good job, good job, Mitch.

1103
01:23:22,377 --> 01:23:24,713
Who calls a suicide squeeze
in that situation?

1104
01:23:24,796 --> 01:23:29,343
A Norway coach with big stones.
I feel awful about this. Awful.

1105
01:23:29,426 --> 01:23:31,720
You wanna give me a hit off that flask?

1106
01:23:31,804 --> 01:23:32,846
If you get a cup.

1107
01:23:38,060 --> 01:23:39,561
Oh, it's beautiful.

1108
01:23:39,645 --> 01:23:41,355
-Yeah.
-Thank you.

1109
01:23:43,857 --> 01:23:46,985
-It's a little small, though.
-I know.

1110
01:23:47,069 --> 01:23:49,988
It's 'cause it's for me. Come on.

1111
01:23:53,408 --> 01:23:54,910
All right.

1112
01:24:08,924 --> 01:24:11,426
Norway High School plays its final
baseball season.

1113
01:24:11,510 --> 01:24:14,429
And today begins play in its final
state tournament.

1114
01:24:14,513 --> 01:24:18,475
Then the Tigers broke it open in the third.
Patrick Iverson doubles to left center,

1115
01:24:18,559 --> 01:24:21,436
scoring Stewart, and the Redhats lead 2-0.

1116
01:24:23,480 --> 01:24:27,151
The Tigers scored three in the third
two more in the fifth, to win it 7-0.

1117
01:24:27,234 --> 01:24:30,487
They're headed back to the state
title game set for noon on Saturday.

1118
01:24:30,571 --> 01:24:33,282
The last game ever for the Norway Tigers.

1119
01:24:38,453 --> 01:24:40,289
Hey, Mom.

1120
01:24:40,372 --> 01:24:43,792
You know, I heard a rumor
there's a big game tomorrow.

1121
01:24:43,876 --> 01:24:45,294
-Son.
-Dad.

1122
01:24:45,377 --> 01:24:46,795
Thought I'd stop by.

1123
01:24:46,879 --> 01:24:48,964
-Dad.
-Son.

1124
01:24:51,425 --> 01:24:53,552
You need help with your bag?

1125
01:24:54,887 --> 01:24:56,096
Yeah.

1126
01:25:02,144 --> 01:25:04,229
I packed two.

1127
01:25:04,313 --> 01:25:09,151
I figured, you know, a hick town like this
could use a big city guy around.

1128
01:25:09,193 --> 01:25:10,402
Yeah.

1129
01:25:10,486 --> 01:25:12,696
Plus, I probably still got some fans
down at the old folks' home.

1130
01:25:12,779 --> 01:25:14,990
Yeah. And your friends in jail.

1131
01:25:20,204 --> 01:25:23,165
-You called him, didn't you?
-Shut up.

1132
01:25:24,875 --> 01:25:28,170
Oh, Dad, you know those cigars
you wanted me to send you?

1133
01:25:28,212 --> 01:25:29,671
Brought 'em with me.

1134
01:25:29,713 --> 01:25:31,423
Shut up.

1135
01:25:35,928 --> 01:25:37,721
What the hell is with these guys?

1136
01:25:37,805 --> 01:25:40,390
6-0 in the state tournament
and we're washed up?

1137
01:25:40,474 --> 01:25:43,602
How the hell do they figure that?

1138
01:25:43,685 --> 01:25:45,896
-Dad...
-Do something with him.

1139
01:25:45,979 --> 01:25:49,358
Gillett Grove South Clay is 31-8, Dad.
I mean, they're all seniors.

1140
01:25:49,399 --> 01:25:51,819
Of course they're gonna be the favorites.

1141
01:25:51,902 --> 01:25:54,363
-They don't lose a whole lot.
-That don't mean they can't.

1142
01:25:54,446 --> 01:25:56,657
I know. I mean, look,
just listen to us on the radio,

1143
01:25:56,740 --> 01:25:58,534
cheer us on, all right? We'll be fine.

1144
01:25:58,575 --> 01:26:01,662
All right, all right, all right. Okay.

1145
01:26:01,745 --> 01:26:04,915
And do not sit there
and get yourself all worked up.

1146
01:26:04,998 --> 01:26:08,210
Of course not.
All right, just go to the game, I'll be fine.

1147
01:26:08,252 --> 01:26:11,255
Don't worry about a thing.
I've got Doc Michaels' pager number,

1148
01:26:11,296 --> 01:26:14,174
if we need it, which we won't.
Just go enjoy the ball game.

1149
01:26:14,258 --> 01:26:16,093
Would you get my purse, please?

1150
01:26:16,135 --> 01:26:18,887
-Be good!
-I'll see to it.

1151
01:27:33,712 --> 01:27:35,964
Come in.

1152
01:27:36,048 --> 01:27:37,758
Jim, thank God you're here.

1153
01:27:37,841 --> 01:27:39,009
What the hell took you so long?

1154
01:27:39,092 --> 01:27:41,970
Damn flight was late. Sure you're up to this?

1155
01:27:42,054 --> 01:27:47,351
Last game, Coach. End of an era.
Got to be there for that one.

1156
01:27:47,392 --> 01:27:50,479
Aren't you afraid the doc's gonna see you?

1157
01:27:50,562 --> 01:27:52,898
Ain't the doc I'm worried about.

1158
01:28:16,547 --> 01:28:18,298
No, sit down.

1159
01:28:25,305 --> 01:28:28,517
Okay. It's one and done.

1160
01:28:28,600 --> 01:28:30,936
Forever.

1161
01:28:31,019 --> 01:28:33,772
South Clay is 31-8.

1162
01:28:33,814 --> 01:28:38,026
The eight games they lost were
when Reed Ellis wasn't in the rotation.

1163
01:28:38,110 --> 01:28:40,779
He's pitching today.

1164
01:28:40,863 --> 01:28:43,448
We all know he's being scouted
by pro teams.

1165
01:28:43,532 --> 01:28:47,536
But one player doesn't win a baseball game.

1166
01:28:47,619 --> 01:28:48,954
Sammy?

1167
01:28:51,665 --> 01:28:55,377
He can if he throws 92 miles an hour,
Coach.

1168
01:28:55,460 --> 01:28:58,630
We win by playing Norway baseball.

1169
01:28:58,672 --> 01:29:01,383
Eighty percent of this game is defense.

1170
01:29:01,467 --> 01:29:04,511
We don't let anything get out of the infield
and we wait.

1171
01:29:04,595 --> 01:29:08,182
Sooner or later, they'll make a mistake.

1172
01:29:08,265 --> 01:29:13,437
Every player whose ever worn a Norway
uniform is out there with you today.

1173
01:29:13,520 --> 01:29:14,938
And think about this.

1174
01:29:15,022 --> 01:29:17,691
No other Iowa High School baseball dynasty

1175
01:29:17,774 --> 01:29:21,820
has ever won a state championship
in their final season.

1176
01:29:21,862 --> 01:29:25,282
We're playing for everyone
who knows that Norway

1177
01:29:25,365 --> 01:29:28,911
is a great place to come home to.

1178
01:29:28,994 --> 01:29:33,040
And no matter what happens today,
this time next year,

1179
01:29:33,123 --> 01:29:37,044
the jerseys you're wearing will be
polishing chrome at Madison High School.

1180
01:29:37,127 --> 01:29:39,338
So ask yourself one question.

1181
01:29:41,507 --> 01:29:43,884
How do you want to be remembered?

1182
01:29:48,263 --> 01:29:50,682
All right, let's go. Bring it in.

1183
01:29:56,563 --> 01:29:58,315
Give us the count, Big-O.

1184
01:29:58,398 --> 01:30:00,734
-One, two, three...
-Tigers!

1185
01:30:06,156 --> 01:30:11,411
Ladies and gentlemen, please rise
for the singing of our national anthem.

1186
01:30:25,676 --> 01:30:30,430
Oh, say, can you see

1187
01:30:30,472 --> 01:30:36,436
By the dawn's early light

1188
01:30:36,478 --> 01:30:41,441
What so proudly we hailed

1189
01:30:42,317 --> 01:30:46,989
At the twilight's last gleaming?

1190
01:30:47,072 --> 01:30:52,077
Whose broad stripes and bright stars

1191
01:30:52,161 --> 01:30:56,582
Through the perilous fight

1192
01:30:56,665 --> 01:31:02,004
O'er the ramparts we watched

1193
01:31:02,087 --> 01:31:07,509
Were so gallantly streaming

1194
01:31:07,551 --> 01:31:11,930
And the rocket's red glare

1195
01:31:12,014 --> 01:31:17,311
The bombs bursting in air

1196
01:31:17,352 --> 01:31:22,149
Gave proof through the night

1197
01:31:22,191 --> 01:31:26,820
That our flag was still there

1198
01:31:27,362 --> 01:31:33,327
O say, does that star-spangled

1199
01:31:33,785 --> 01:31:39,249
Banner yet wave

1200
01:31:39,333 --> 01:31:44,713
O'er the land of the free

1201
01:31:44,755 --> 01:31:50,177
And the home of the

1202
01:31:50,260 --> 01:31:52,846
Brave

1203
01:31:54,556 --> 01:31:56,850
Thank you very much. Play ball.

1204
01:32:05,776 --> 01:32:07,277
I did it!

1205
01:32:09,988 --> 01:32:11,573
Tigers!

1206
01:32:11,907 --> 01:32:13,909
Come on, Norway!

1207
01:32:18,789 --> 01:32:20,207
Now, you be calm.

1208
01:32:20,290 --> 01:32:24,461
Me? You stay calm. Don't worry about me.

1209
01:32:24,545 --> 01:32:26,421
And the Norway Tigers take the field

1210
01:32:26,463 --> 01:32:29,925
looking to secure their 20th title in this,
their final season,

1211
01:32:29,967 --> 01:32:32,177
against the heavily favored,
senior dominated

1212
01:32:32,261 --> 01:32:35,180
Gillet Grove South Clay Spartans.

1213
01:32:37,015 --> 01:32:39,560
With senior pitcher Kevin Stewart
out of the rotation

1214
01:32:39,643 --> 01:32:41,812
there's a lot of pressure on
the Tiger's junior pitcher,

1215
01:32:41,895 --> 01:32:44,314
number 29, Sammy Wilson.

1216
01:32:46,650 --> 01:32:49,528
Let's go, Sammy, huh? Shoot strikes, kid!
Shoot strikes!

1217
01:33:06,545 --> 01:33:09,006
All right, now, Redhats! Two down!

1218
01:33:15,053 --> 01:33:16,096
Out!

1219
01:33:16,180 --> 01:33:21,310
Well, so far so good. Three up, three down
on solid defensive playing by the Tigers.

1220
01:33:21,393 --> 01:33:22,269
Nice work!

1221
01:33:23,228 --> 01:33:26,273
And that will bring to the mound
Gillet Grove South Clay's

1222
01:33:26,356 --> 01:33:32,112
superstar pitcher, Reed Ellis,
a statewide MVP four consecutive years.

1223
01:33:32,196 --> 01:33:35,157
Ellis will be attending
the University of Arizona in the fall

1224
01:33:35,240 --> 01:33:39,620
and, according to scouting reports,
is a number-one pro draft contender.

1225
01:33:45,417 --> 01:33:47,044
Kid can pitch.

1226
01:33:56,929 --> 01:33:59,348
That boy pitches very fast, huh, Daddy?

1227
01:33:59,431 --> 01:34:01,016
Sure does, sweetie.

1228
01:34:02,601 --> 01:34:04,228
-Come on, let's go.
-Yeah.

1229
01:34:04,269 --> 01:34:05,354
Come on now, Eddie!

1230
01:34:05,437 --> 01:34:06,396
Batter's up.

1231
01:34:07,105 --> 01:34:10,025
All right, Eddie, let's go, start us off now!

1232
01:34:28,961 --> 01:34:30,212
Strike!

1233
01:34:32,631 --> 01:34:33,841
Strike!

1234
01:34:37,010 --> 01:34:38,095
Strike three!

1235
01:34:38,137 --> 01:34:40,973
This guy's not gonna make the pros,
he is a pro.

1236
01:34:44,268 --> 01:34:46,436
Don't worry, you'll get it next trip.

1237
01:34:46,478 --> 01:34:48,397
It's hard to hit an aspirin tablet, Big-O.

1238
01:34:56,029 --> 01:34:57,614
Ellis throwing bullets.

1239
01:34:57,698 --> 01:35:03,120
Chasing the Norway batter out of the box
with a 95-mile-an-hour fast ball.

1240
01:35:09,042 --> 01:35:10,085
Strike!

1241
01:35:10,169 --> 01:35:13,046
Come on, Sammy, swing the bat!

1242
01:35:18,802 --> 01:35:19,803
Strike three!

1243
01:35:19,887 --> 01:35:22,306
And there's strike three.
I know it's scary in there,

1244
01:35:22,389 --> 01:35:25,893
but you'll never get on base
if you jump out of the box like that.

1245
01:35:25,976 --> 01:35:29,521
There's no other way to put it.
That is pure fear.

1246
01:35:37,154 --> 01:35:38,864
-Come on, Mitch!
-Come on, Mitch!

1247
01:35:38,947 --> 01:35:40,908
All right, let's go!

1248
01:35:40,991 --> 01:35:42,826
All right, Mitch, now!

1249
01:35:49,541 --> 01:35:50,542
Strike!

1250
01:35:51,919 --> 01:35:53,128
Two!

1251
01:35:55,589 --> 01:35:56,548
Strike three!

1252
01:35:56,632 --> 01:36:00,219
That's three up, three down.
A ninth straight strike from Ellis.

1253
01:36:00,302 --> 01:36:01,553
A masterful display.

1254
01:36:01,595 --> 01:36:02,679
It's gonna be a long day.

1255
01:36:02,763 --> 01:36:05,432
All right, let's go, Norway!
Defense, come on now!

1256
01:36:12,523 --> 01:36:15,901
There it is! Come on now, turn it! Turn it!

1257
01:36:17,069 --> 01:36:21,657
Tough defensive play by Norway
keeping the Tigers alive!

1258
01:36:21,740 --> 01:36:24,827
Come on, Kev, let's hit this guy!
Come on now!

1259
01:36:30,082 --> 01:36:31,917
That sucker's throwing bullets.

1260
01:36:31,959 --> 01:36:34,378
Here we go now! Take a look!

1261
01:36:35,003 --> 01:36:36,797
Come on now.

1262
01:36:43,470 --> 01:36:44,680
Strike!

1263
01:36:49,351 --> 01:36:51,728
Strike three! You're out!

1264
01:36:51,812 --> 01:36:53,814
Ellis on his game today.

1265
01:36:53,897 --> 01:36:57,192
Un-hittable so far, frustrating Norway.

1266
01:36:57,276 --> 01:36:59,778
And now up to bat, Reed Ellis.

1267
01:37:05,576 --> 01:37:08,912
Ellis, with a long drive to deep left field!

1268
01:37:08,996 --> 01:37:14,918
That'll clear the bases. Oh, my!
Ellis is an army of one today!

1269
01:37:15,002 --> 01:37:16,962
-Hold him, hold him!
-Let's go!

1270
01:37:19,214 --> 01:37:21,717
Don't give in, Sammy, come on now!

1271
01:37:21,758 --> 01:37:26,305
And South Clay opens it up with two runs
in the top of the third.

1272
01:37:26,388 --> 01:37:29,725
Underdog Norway just looks stunned
at the moment.

1273
01:37:29,808 --> 01:37:30,809
-Time, blue!
-Time!

1274
01:37:30,893 --> 01:37:35,272
Coach Kent Stock, up and out of
the dugout and on his way to the mound.

1275
01:37:39,610 --> 01:37:42,029
-How's your arm?
-I'm fine.

1276
01:37:43,113 --> 01:37:45,115
We're supposed to be out here waiting
for them to make mistakes,

1277
01:37:45,199 --> 01:37:48,327
not the other way around, right?

1278
01:37:48,410 --> 01:37:52,206
Mow these guys down and let's get off
the mound, all right?

1279
01:38:04,760 --> 01:38:08,555
-Out.
-Atta way, boys! Let's go!

1280
01:38:10,224 --> 01:38:12,935
Come on, now, Sam. Keep it down.

1281
01:38:17,481 --> 01:38:18,941
-Out!
-Yes!

1282
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:31,411
Nice job!

1283
01:38:31,495 --> 01:38:33,539
Pretty sharp. That's his game, defense.

1284
01:38:33,622 --> 01:38:36,583
Apparently, Coach Stock's words of
encouragement to his pitcher worked.

1285
01:38:36,667 --> 01:38:38,877
And the Tigers strand Ellis on base.

1286
01:38:38,961 --> 01:38:42,297
Do I have to do this by myself again?
Let's get it out of the infield next time!

1287
01:38:42,381 --> 01:38:43,799
And that didn't sit well with Ellis.

1288
01:38:43,882 --> 01:38:45,843
Complaining loudly at his teammates.

1289
01:38:45,884 --> 01:38:48,595
An outburst like that could get him ejected
if he's not careful.

1290
01:38:48,679 --> 01:38:51,890
He's gonna hang one for you right now.

1291
01:38:51,974 --> 01:38:53,809
-How do you know, Coach?
-Just trust me.

1292
01:39:01,859 --> 01:39:03,527
Ellis into the stretch.

1293
01:39:03,610 --> 01:39:05,445
And the pitch.

1294
01:39:05,529 --> 01:39:07,156
Iverson connects!

1295
01:39:07,239 --> 01:39:09,741
It's way back! Deep to right field!

1296
01:39:09,825 --> 01:39:11,535
Going! Going!

1297
01:39:11,618 --> 01:39:13,328
It is gone!

1298
01:39:13,370 --> 01:39:14,371
Yeah!

1299
01:39:14,913 --> 01:39:17,374
-Son of a...
-Holy Toledo!

1300
01:39:17,416 --> 01:39:21,253
That's a round tripper for Patrick Iverson!

1301
01:39:21,336 --> 01:39:23,005
Now we're in it! Now we're in it!

1302
01:39:23,088 --> 01:39:26,508
That could be the first dent in Ellis's armor,

1303
01:39:26,550 --> 01:39:31,388
with Norway finally on the board,
or it could be too little, too late.

1304
01:39:31,430 --> 01:39:34,224
Dude, what are you doing here? Go catch.

1305
01:39:34,266 --> 01:39:36,894
Hey, Coach.
How'd you know he was gonna hang one?

1306
01:39:37,436 --> 01:39:38,604
I scouted him.

1307
01:39:39,229 --> 01:39:42,024
Folks, this could be it for the Norway Tigers.

1308
01:39:42,065 --> 01:39:47,654
Bottom of the seventh,
trailing Gillet Grove South Clay 4 to 3.

1309
01:39:47,738 --> 01:39:53,660
A dynasty of 19 state championships
in the past 24 years

1310
01:39:53,744 --> 01:39:56,038
could be about to end.

1311
01:40:16,892 --> 01:40:19,102
Sammy?

1312
01:40:19,144 --> 01:40:21,063
What are you gonna do?

1313
01:40:22,314 --> 01:40:24,608
I'm gonna get on base.

1314
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:31,448
Two outs, nobody on,
and the Norway pitcher up at bat.

1315
01:40:31,532 --> 01:40:32,616
He's 0 for 2 today.

1316
01:40:32,658 --> 01:40:33,826
Two down, it's all you!

1317
01:40:33,909 --> 01:40:35,828
Norway desperately needs a man on base.

1318
01:40:35,869 --> 01:40:38,664
But Ellis continues to go hard
to the inside corners!

1319
01:40:38,747 --> 01:40:42,584
And number 29 has been on his heels,
backing out of the box all day.

1320
01:40:47,631 --> 01:40:51,885
Brushed back by a 94-mile-an-hour
fastball for strike one.

1321
01:40:57,224 --> 01:41:00,602
The Norway batter, crowding.
Challenging Ellis.

1322
01:41:02,271 --> 01:41:04,314
It's gonna hurt, stupid.

1323
01:41:06,942 --> 01:41:12,239
Oh, that was close!
Just catching the inside edge for strike two!

1324
01:41:18,871 --> 01:41:21,665
Folks, he is very close to the plate here.

1325
01:41:26,462 --> 01:41:28,964
Crowding dangerously close now.

1326
01:41:31,341 --> 01:41:33,218
Ellis into the stretch.

1327
01:41:34,178 --> 01:41:35,554
And the pitch.

1328
01:41:39,475 --> 01:41:40,809
That has got to hurt.

1329
01:41:40,893 --> 01:41:45,105
A 93-mile-an-hour fastball puts
the batter on his knees.

1330
01:41:45,189 --> 01:41:47,900
Coach Stock over immediately
to check on his player.

1331
01:41:47,983 --> 01:41:50,110
Ellis now clearly frustrated.

1332
01:41:50,194 --> 01:41:52,988
-Where'd he get ya?
-In the back.

1333
01:41:55,782 --> 01:41:58,076
Give me the bat.

1334
01:41:58,118 --> 01:42:00,496
Couple of deep breaths. Come on.

1335
01:42:03,790 --> 01:42:05,292
-You wanna play?
-Yeah.

1336
01:42:05,751 --> 01:42:08,879
Okay. Sam, don't ever do that again.

1337
01:42:08,962 --> 01:42:11,548
And he's all right.

1338
01:42:11,632 --> 01:42:14,301
The crowd up and applauding the effort.

1339
01:42:15,636 --> 01:42:20,057
As third baseman Kevin Stewart
comes to bat, trying to keep Norway alive.

1340
01:42:20,682 --> 01:42:24,394
Stewart's a.320 hitter,
but his bat's been quiet today.

1341
01:42:24,478 --> 01:42:27,606
Come on, Kevin, start a rally!

1342
01:42:28,649 --> 01:42:32,069
-You stay calm now.
-Me?

1343
01:42:38,951 --> 01:42:40,160
Strike!

1344
01:42:51,338 --> 01:42:52,840
Strike two!

1345
01:42:53,549 --> 01:42:56,135
Norway is down to their last strike.

1346
01:43:02,391 --> 01:43:05,602
Come on, boy! You can hit this guy!

1347
01:43:05,686 --> 01:43:06,895
Just stay focused!

1348
01:43:06,979 --> 01:43:10,023
And Stewart's out of the box.
Some sort of distraction in the stands.

1349
01:43:10,107 --> 01:43:11,984
What? He made me come.

1350
01:43:13,986 --> 01:43:17,948
It's ex-Norway coach, Jim Van Scoyoc.

1351
01:43:28,750 --> 01:43:30,377
And Stewart's back in the box.

1352
01:43:30,461 --> 01:43:32,796
Ellis checks the runner at first.

1353
01:43:37,718 --> 01:43:39,928
He's into the stretch.

1354
01:43:41,388 --> 01:43:43,849
And the Norway runner goes!

1355
01:43:43,932 --> 01:43:46,101
Stewart gets a hold of it!

1356
01:43:46,185 --> 01:43:48,604
Line deep to right center!

1357
01:43:48,687 --> 01:43:51,398
Come on, you gotta go! You gotta go!

1358
01:43:51,440 --> 01:43:54,735
Get down, down! Go, go, go!
Go! You gotta be down!

1359
01:43:55,777 --> 01:43:57,446
Safe!

1360
01:43:59,823 --> 01:44:04,369
Unbelievable!
The Norway Tigers have come back!

1361
01:44:04,453 --> 01:44:08,874
This game is tied!
We're going to extra innings!

1362
01:44:08,957 --> 01:44:09,958
Bring it in!

1363
01:44:10,042 --> 01:44:12,586
Sammy, you did a heck of a job.
Tommy, grab third base.

1364
01:44:12,628 --> 01:44:15,798
Now, listen, we got our opportunity,
we took advantage of it, let's not blow it.

1365
01:44:15,881 --> 01:44:18,300
Solid defense,
nothing gets out of the infield.

1366
01:44:18,342 --> 01:44:21,053
Kevin, it's on you. Let's go! Win it!

1367
01:44:21,136 --> 01:44:22,930
All right, let's go, boys, let's go!

1368
01:44:22,971 --> 01:44:25,307
Hey! You did right.

1369
01:44:26,266 --> 01:44:28,268
Yo! Get us out of this,
I'll get you a six-pack.

1370
01:44:28,352 --> 01:44:32,105
-You already owe me a six-pack.
-He'll get you another one.

1371
01:44:41,782 --> 01:44:43,158
Hey, Sammy.

1372
01:44:45,452 --> 01:44:46,995
Come on, Kevin!

1373
01:45:07,558 --> 01:45:09,017
Yeah!

1374
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:12,020
One down, one down, Norway!

1375
01:45:12,104 --> 01:45:14,064
Yeah, let's go!

1376
01:45:16,233 --> 01:45:18,610
One down! Two more, guys, come on!

1377
01:45:18,694 --> 01:45:21,530
Two more outs! Norway defense, right here!

1378
01:45:30,455 --> 01:45:32,332
Ball, ball, ball!

1379
01:45:32,416 --> 01:45:33,375
Out!

1380
01:45:35,419 --> 01:45:38,839
Go! Tigers!

1381
01:46:16,460 --> 01:46:18,337
You gotta be kidding me with that.

1382
01:46:18,420 --> 01:46:19,963
Oh, my God.

1383
01:46:20,047 --> 01:46:24,802
Oh! That's a heck of a catch.
That's a baseball catch.

1384
01:46:25,219 --> 01:46:30,349
With a man on first, senior Steve Meyers
off the injured list, up to bat for Norway.

1385
01:46:30,432 --> 01:46:33,310
Trying to come through in the clutch
for the Tigers.

1386
01:46:47,324 --> 01:46:49,326
Gotta go! Gotta go! Gotta go!

1387
01:46:49,409 --> 01:46:52,120
-Gotta get down! Down, down, down!
-Safe!

1388
01:46:52,162 --> 01:46:54,498
That a boy! There you go!

1389
01:46:54,540 --> 01:46:58,210
Oh, my! That's it! Here we go!

1390
01:46:58,293 --> 01:47:01,630
Winning run on third for Norway! Two outs!

1391
01:47:01,713 --> 01:47:05,342
Catcher, Mitch Akers,
a transfer from Chicago, coming up.

1392
01:47:05,384 --> 01:47:11,014
His dad played ball at Norway 20 years ago
under legendary coach Jim Van Scoyoc.

1393
01:47:11,056 --> 01:47:13,142
Folks, this is it.

1394
01:47:13,225 --> 01:47:16,770
Can you imagine the weight
on that young man's shoulders?

1395
01:47:16,854 --> 01:47:19,022
Come on, Akers, be a hero!

1396
01:47:42,880 --> 01:47:45,883
Akers squares to bunt.
The Spartan infield charges to cover.

1397
01:47:45,966 --> 01:47:47,342
Strike one.

1398
01:47:47,426 --> 01:47:49,887
You don't think Stock would call
a squeeze here, do you?

1399
01:47:49,970 --> 01:47:52,723
-Wouldn't surprise me one bit.
-With two outs?

1400
01:47:52,764 --> 01:47:55,434
Two outs, five outs.
With this guy, who knows?

1401
01:47:55,517 --> 01:47:58,562
I do not believe that this is happening.

1402
01:47:58,604 --> 01:48:00,314
I love you too, Dad.

1403
01:48:11,408 --> 01:48:14,495
Come on, now. Come on, let's go!

1404
01:48:36,099 --> 01:48:39,812
Akers hits away! And towards the gap!

1405
01:48:40,145 --> 01:48:41,396
Yeah!

1406
01:48:44,858 --> 01:48:48,445
Took the bunt sign off
and had him hit away. Unbelievable.

1407
01:48:48,529 --> 01:48:49,488
Fooled me.

1408
01:48:49,571 --> 01:48:50,906
Fooled South Clay.

1409
01:48:50,989 --> 01:48:53,158
Can you believe this?

1410
01:48:53,242 --> 01:48:59,081
Rookie coach Kent Stock has led
the Norway Tigers to an unprecedented

1411
01:48:59,164 --> 01:49:04,044
20th Iowa state high school
baseball championship!

1412
01:49:04,128 --> 01:49:06,964
Some traditions just refuse to die!

1413
01:49:13,387 --> 01:49:14,388
Hello?

1414
01:49:14,513 --> 01:49:20,394
Harvey, it's Sam. It was classic.
He coaches just like Van Scoyoc.

1415
01:49:20,435 --> 01:49:23,313
I hate to have to tell you this, but...

1416
01:49:28,610 --> 01:49:30,279
They won!

1417
01:49:30,362 --> 01:49:34,324
Really? Yeah, well,
that doesn't change anything.

1418
01:49:34,408 --> 01:49:36,702
It sure does change
the way you'll get remembered.

1419
01:49:36,743 --> 01:49:38,245
See ya, Harvey.

1420
01:49:40,330 --> 01:49:41,540
Yes!

1421
01:50:06,023 --> 01:50:08,567
It's been a great one,
and I've just enjoyed it 100 percent.

1422
01:50:08,650 --> 01:50:11,570
I'd like to thank Jim Van Scoyoc for
having me as his assistant last year

1423
01:50:11,653 --> 01:50:13,238
and giving me this opportunity.

1424
01:50:13,280 --> 01:50:14,615
This has been a special year for me.

1425
01:51:14,633 --> 01:51:15,634
