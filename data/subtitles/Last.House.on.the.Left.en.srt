1
00:00:58,105 --> 00:01:01,563
Hello, Cassie! Hiya, girl. Hello there.

2
00:01:02,275 --> 00:01:03,765
Let's see.

3
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:10,314
Looks like Mari's getting cards
from half the civilized world.

4
00:01:10,917 --> 00:01:12,509
''Mari Collingwood.''

5
00:01:16,623 --> 00:01:20,184
You'd think she's the only kid
to reach the age of 17.

6
00:01:22,996 --> 00:01:26,227
Of course, she is
about the prettiest piece l've ever seen.

7
00:01:36,643 --> 00:01:39,635
-Mari Collingwood, you hurry up!
-Okay!

8
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,841
Drill sergeant.

9
00:02:20,787 --> 00:02:23,153
Did you call the repair service?

10
00:02:23,457 --> 00:02:26,392
Did you tell them l was a physician
and had to have a phone?

11
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:29,657
No, actually, l told them
you were an international bookie...

12
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:33,062
...and l was 10 months pregnant
with quintuplets.

13
00:02:35,302 --> 00:02:37,770
What's new in the outside world?

14
00:02:37,904 --> 00:02:40,498
Same old stuff, murder and mayhem.

15
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:43,236
-What's for dinner?
-Freezer's full, take your choice.

16
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:46,507
What's that supposed to mean?
Mari, you be careful tonight.

17
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:50,949
Your mother tells me the place
you're going is in a bad neighborhood.

18
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:53,709
l will, Daddy.

19
00:02:53,787 --> 00:02:55,311
No bra?

20
00:02:55,522 --> 00:02:57,717
Of course not!
Nobody wears those anymore.

21
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:59,622
Nobody except us drill sergeants.

22
00:02:59,693 --> 00:03:02,560
But look, Estelle.
You can see her nipples as plain as day.

23
00:03:02,629 --> 00:03:04,494
Daddy, don't be so clinical.

24
00:03:04,564 --> 00:03:06,759
-But it's immodest.
-l'll get some sandpaper!

25
00:03:06,867 --> 00:03:08,596
Young lady, when l was your age--

26
00:03:08,668 --> 00:03:13,002
You all wore brassieres that made
your tits stick out like torpedoes.

27
00:03:13,073 --> 00:03:16,975
Tits! What's this ''tits'' business?
Sounds like l'm back in the barracks.

28
00:03:17,043 --> 00:03:19,443
All right, then. Mammary glands.

29
00:03:19,513 --> 00:03:22,778
They used to tie them up
like little lunatics in straitjackets...

30
00:03:22,849 --> 00:03:25,409
...and they stuffed socks in their bras.

31
00:03:25,485 --> 00:03:27,544
You told me that yourself, Mother.

32
00:03:27,621 --> 00:03:31,990
lf God had meant women
to go around with their bust exposed...

33
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:34,593
...he wouldn't have given us clothes!

34
00:03:35,262 --> 00:03:37,230
Who are you gonna see tonight?

35
00:03:37,297 --> 00:03:39,197
-Bloodlust.
-Bloodlust?

36
00:03:39,266 --> 00:03:43,066
-Yeah. What's wrong with them?
-l was just reading about them.

37
00:03:43,136 --> 00:03:46,469
Aren't they the guys that dismember
live chickens during their act?

38
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,169
-They only did that once.
-Don't you feel sorry for the chicken?

39
00:03:50,277 --> 00:03:54,771
l couldn't tell you the nights
l cried myself to sleep over that chicken.

40
00:03:54,848 --> 00:03:57,316
-Have you seen the car keys?
-On the table.

41
00:03:57,384 --> 00:03:58,544
l think it's crazy.

42
00:03:58,618 --> 00:04:00,711
-What's crazy?
-All that blood and violence.

43
00:04:00,787 --> 00:04:03,517
l thought you were supposed to be
the Love Generation.

44
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:04,989
That reminds me.

45
00:04:05,292 --> 00:04:08,227
-What?
-Here's a little something for you.

46
00:04:09,863 --> 00:04:12,798
-Just a gift to tide you over till tomorrow.
-Daddy!

47
00:04:16,436 --> 00:04:18,700
Mother. lt's nice.

48
00:04:19,406 --> 00:04:20,873
Maybe it'll bring you luck.

49
00:04:20,941 --> 00:04:24,536
By the way, who are you going out with
tonight? Anyone we know?

50
00:04:24,644 --> 00:04:27,169
-Phyllis Stone.
-Phyllis Stone?

51
00:04:27,247 --> 00:04:31,547
l know you don't like her, but l'm safe
with her. She's from that neighborhood.

52
00:04:31,618 --> 00:04:32,846
What neighborhood?

53
00:04:32,919 --> 00:04:35,979
Where the concert is.
You know, from that slum.

54
00:04:36,056 --> 00:04:37,580
l'm sure she does.

55
00:04:39,693 --> 00:04:42,389
Come on! l've got something for us.

56
00:04:42,862 --> 00:04:45,296
-What?
-Come on. You'll see.

57
00:04:45,365 --> 00:04:47,128
-Okay.
-Hurry up.

58
00:04:48,635 --> 00:04:51,866
Who's Phyllis? You make her
sound like the bride of Frankenstein.

59
00:04:51,938 --> 00:04:55,965
She's the girl who takes care of the horses
at the Johnson place, isn'tshe, Mari?

60
00:04:56,042 --> 00:04:57,509
What worries you?

61
00:04:57,577 --> 00:05:01,980
From what Nancy Springer tells me,
that's not all she takes care of down there.

62
00:05:02,248 --> 00:05:05,308
Mari tells me you're from Manhattan.
What does your father do?

63
00:05:05,385 --> 00:05:08,479
My parents are in
the iron and steel business.

64
00:05:08,688 --> 00:05:11,213
lron and steel both together. How unusual.

65
00:05:11,324 --> 00:05:13,849
My mother irons, and my father steals.

66
00:05:14,294 --> 00:05:15,818
Come on, Mari.

67
00:05:16,596 --> 00:05:19,258
-l wish we had some grass.
-lt'd be nice to get stoned.

68
00:05:19,332 --> 00:05:22,893
-You don't have any, do you, Mari?
-No! Of course not. Me?

69
00:05:22,969 --> 00:05:25,460
Maybe we can get some
before the concert.

70
00:05:25,538 --> 00:05:27,199
Yeah, the concert.

71
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:31,569
l wonder what it would be like
to make it with Bloodlust.

72
00:05:31,778 --> 00:05:36,147
lt would just be really soft.
Like in a whole bunch of cotton.

73
00:05:36,216 --> 00:05:37,683
You know what l mean?

74
00:05:37,751 --> 00:05:40,015
-Cotton?
-Soft and gentle.

75
00:05:40,086 --> 00:05:44,113
-Give me a break!
-Really sensitive, not wild and gory. God!

76
00:05:44,491 --> 00:05:47,688
You're too much, man. Cotton!

77
00:05:48,695 --> 00:05:51,391
-lt's Bloodlust! They're crazy!
-Like cotton candy.

78
00:06:34,274 --> 00:06:36,640
The leaves are beautiful.

79
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,578
Yep! They're really starting to change.
l guess winter's coming on.

80
00:06:40,647 --> 00:06:44,811
l changed. l changed this winter.

81
00:06:45,318 --> 00:06:49,687
-What do you mean, you changed?
-l mean, my breasts filled out.

82
00:06:50,457 --> 00:06:52,721
Didn't you notice? Look.

83
00:06:52,792 --> 00:06:55,818
-They were nothing last summer.
-l didn't know you last summer.

84
00:06:55,895 --> 00:06:59,854
-l know. They have.
-Congratulations!

85
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:03,391
Come on. l feel like a woman
for the first time in my life.

86
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,698
Yeah?

87
00:07:05,572 --> 00:07:09,372
Rodney Johnson!

88
00:07:35,902 --> 00:07:37,130
Crazy!

89
00:07:37,203 --> 00:07:40,070
The police have spread
their dragnet over five states...

90
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,540
...to catch the fugitives
and their accomplices.

91
00:07:42,609 --> 00:07:44,372
Far out! This is gorgeous.

92
00:07:44,444 --> 00:07:46,241
According to reliable sources...

93
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:49,477
Leave that on, Phyllis. l want to hear it.

94
00:07:49,549 --> 00:07:52,575
...the daring daylight escape
of the two convicted murderers...

95
00:07:52,652 --> 00:07:56,679
...dope pushers, and rapists
cost the lives of two prison guards...

96
00:07:56,756 --> 00:07:59,486
...and surprisingly,
the life of a German shepherd.

97
00:07:59,559 --> 00:08:01,823
According to eyewitness reports,
the animal...

98
00:08:01,895 --> 00:08:04,693
...which was sent after the two men,
was kicked to death...

99
00:08:04,764 --> 00:08:08,564
...by a young, animal-like woman
who leaped from the getaway car.

100
00:08:08,768 --> 00:08:11,862
The alleged driver of the car
was Junior Stillo.

101
00:08:12,105 --> 00:08:15,768
Junior Stillo is the illegitimate son
of the leader of the two escapees...

102
00:08:15,842 --> 00:08:20,438
...Krug Stillo, who was serving
a life sentence for the 1966 triple slaying...

103
00:08:20,513 --> 00:08:22,879
...of a priest and two nuns.

104
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:27,617
Krug Stillo is reputed to have hooked
his own son on heroin...

105
00:08:27,687 --> 00:08:29,621
...to control the youngster's life.

106
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:32,988
The man is armed
and considered extremely dangerous.

107
00:08:33,693 --> 00:08:37,288
The second escaped convictis identified
as Fred ''Weasel'' Podowski...

108
00:08:37,363 --> 00:08:41,094
...who has a long police record
for child molesting, peeping Tom-ism...

109
00:08:41,167 --> 00:08:42,964
...and assault with a deadly weapon.

110
00:08:43,036 --> 00:08:46,369
The three men were accompanied
in their escape by an unknown woman...

111
00:08:46,439 --> 00:08:50,034
...described only as young, strong,
and animal-like.

112
00:08:50,376 --> 00:08:53,539
Police believe the four may still be
in the New York City area...

113
00:08:53,613 --> 00:08:57,982
...but expect them to try to leave
the state within the next 48 hours.

114
00:08:58,351 --> 00:09:00,819
Thanks. Sounds like good advice.

115
00:09:01,087 --> 00:09:03,419
''l'm singin' in the rain''

116
00:09:03,756 --> 00:09:05,121
Sadie!

117
00:09:05,792 --> 00:09:08,522
-Yeah?
-Hurry up! l want to take a bath, too.

118
00:09:08,595 --> 00:09:12,429
Okay! What do you think
of your new clothes?

119
00:09:12,966 --> 00:09:14,866
l handpicked them at Korvette's.

120
00:09:14,934 --> 00:09:16,367
Wonderful.

121
00:09:32,385 --> 00:09:34,649
-Who is it?
-lt's J. Edgar Hoover.

122
00:09:37,123 --> 00:09:38,988
-Any trouble?
-No.

123
00:09:44,564 --> 00:09:46,964
-Where's Sadie?
-Taking a bath.

124
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,465
ls Junior back yet?

125
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:51,994
Yeah, and l'm here, too.

126
00:09:52,071 --> 00:09:54,369
-Send him with my beer.
-You heard her.

127
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,274
Go to the icebox and get a beer.
There's a lady in there, man.

128
00:10:17,563 --> 00:10:19,030
Here's your beer.

129
00:10:19,098 --> 00:10:22,067
There he is. The man of the hour.

130
00:10:23,636 --> 00:10:25,194
Thank you.

131
00:10:29,042 --> 00:10:32,443
-You glad your old man's out of the clink?
-Sure.

132
00:10:33,813 --> 00:10:37,909
You know, it's really a shame
you don't get along better with Krug.

133
00:10:38,117 --> 00:10:39,812
You got to change your head around.

134
00:10:39,953 --> 00:10:42,353
Become someone else altogether.

135
00:10:44,724 --> 00:10:48,023
l've been thinking about names
and everything.

136
00:10:48,728 --> 00:10:52,061
How does ''Agatha Greenwood'' grab you?

137
00:10:52,131 --> 00:10:54,622
Like something out of Brighter Day.

138
00:10:54,701 --> 00:10:56,999
You're probably right.

139
00:10:58,805 --> 00:11:00,067
What do you want to be?

140
00:11:00,139 --> 00:11:02,471
-A frog.
-You look like a frog.

141
00:11:03,242 --> 00:11:06,336
lf l was a frog, l'd have my own lily pad.

142
00:11:06,412 --> 00:11:09,609
l could sit there all day long, just....

143
00:11:11,184 --> 00:11:13,414
l could do that, man,
nobody would bother me.

144
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,449
l could watch the flies.

145
00:11:33,606 --> 00:11:35,597
Better watch him, Krug!

146
00:11:36,876 --> 00:11:41,506
Leave Sadie alone, you little toad,
or l'll squash you flat as a lily pad.

147
00:11:47,787 --> 00:11:50,688
-Do we have time before the concert?
-Don't worry about it.

148
00:11:50,757 --> 00:11:52,748
Goodie! l want to have
at least two scoops.

149
00:11:52,825 --> 00:11:55,419
l know what l'm going to have.
Mint chocolate chip.

150
00:11:55,495 --> 00:11:56,894
-Mint chocolate chip?
-Yeah.

151
00:11:56,963 --> 00:11:58,225
No, l don't like that.

152
00:11:58,297 --> 00:12:01,664
-What's this yellow stuff right here?
-Lemon sherbet.

153
00:12:02,035 --> 00:12:03,900
Sherbet. l don't want sherbet.

154
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:07,565
-Can l taste yours?
-Make your own. What do you want?

155
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,939
l don't want that. l want....
What else do you have?

156
00:12:11,144 --> 00:12:14,739
Banana Royal, Neapolitan,
Maple Walnut, Tutti-Frutti--

157
00:12:14,814 --> 00:12:17,749
-Nuts!
-Nuts for the nut.

158
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:21,851
Big goon, put me down!

159
00:12:23,189 --> 00:12:24,850
l hate you!

160
00:12:25,758 --> 00:12:26,747
Let me up.

161
00:12:26,859 --> 00:12:30,955
Forget it! You've got the cream
of American manhood here.

162
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:34,232
The cream of American manhood.
That's good, Krug!

163
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,962
Shut up! And get away from my woman.

164
00:12:37,036 --> 00:12:39,300
Your woman?
l thought she was our woman.

165
00:12:39,372 --> 00:12:42,398
Just a minute! Buzz off!
l'm not neither of yours woman.

166
00:12:42,475 --> 00:12:44,272
l am my own frigging woman!

167
00:12:44,343 --> 00:12:46,072
-She's right, Krug.
-You shut up!

168
00:12:46,145 --> 00:12:48,079
What have you been doing?

169
00:12:48,147 --> 00:12:51,446
Reading them creep women lib magazines
while l was up in the jug?

170
00:12:51,517 --> 00:12:52,711
Maybe.

171
00:12:52,785 --> 00:12:56,243
Why don't you just lay back
and enjoy being inferior?

172
00:12:56,322 --> 00:12:59,052
Zing off! You male chauvinist dog!

173
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:00,649
Pig, Sadie.

174
00:13:00,726 --> 00:13:03,126
-What?
-Male chauvinist pig.

175
00:13:03,229 --> 00:13:05,094
Okay, you male chauvinist pig!

176
00:13:05,364 --> 00:13:07,594
-She's right.
-You shut up!

177
00:13:07,667 --> 00:13:11,626
l ain't putting out any more until l get
a couple more chicks around here.

178
00:13:11,737 --> 00:13:15,036
-Couple of more chicks?
-Yeah. Equal representation.

179
00:13:15,141 --> 00:13:17,234
-What, are you crazy?
-She's right.

180
00:13:17,310 --> 00:13:19,005
Get out of here!

181
00:13:19,345 --> 00:13:22,781
God! This neighborhood's awful.
lt's so dirty. My mother was right.

182
00:13:22,849 --> 00:13:25,409
lt's not awful, it's just funky. That's all.

183
00:13:25,485 --> 00:13:26,509
Dirt all over.

184
00:13:26,586 --> 00:13:30,181
Keep your eyes open
for someone who might be dealing.

185
00:13:32,258 --> 00:13:35,125
-Want me to ask him?
-Go ahead.

186
00:13:39,732 --> 00:13:41,393
Hey, man.

187
00:13:41,501 --> 00:13:46,234
You don't know where we could score
on some good grass, do you?

188
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:49,136
-l don't know that stuff.
-Thanks.

189
00:13:49,242 --> 00:13:51,176
-Bummer.
-Come on.

190
00:13:52,411 --> 00:13:55,505
Oh, man! Lady! Come on back here.

191
00:13:55,581 --> 00:13:57,378
Let's get together.

192
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,708
Yeah?

193
00:13:58,784 --> 00:14:02,242
l do happen to have in my possession...

194
00:14:03,022 --> 00:14:06,150
...an extra ounce of good stuff.

195
00:14:06,225 --> 00:14:09,194
-What kind?
-Colombian.

196
00:14:09,262 --> 00:14:12,163
Colombian? Far out!

197
00:14:12,565 --> 00:14:15,329
-How much?
-$20.

198
00:14:15,735 --> 00:14:19,364
$20, and it's Colombian?

199
00:14:19,438 --> 00:14:22,339
l need the money, but if that's too high--

200
00:14:22,408 --> 00:14:26,174
No! That's great. We'll take it.
How do we get it?

201
00:14:32,118 --> 00:14:34,985
-This is my roommate, Sam.
-Hiya, girls!

202
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:37,312
This is my sister, Martha.

203
00:14:37,423 --> 00:14:40,790
These girls want to buy some grass.

204
00:14:40,927 --> 00:14:42,690
Come on in.

205
00:14:46,465 --> 00:14:48,092
-Gotcha!
-Shit!

206
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:53,263
Stick around a while. How about a bite?

207
00:14:53,339 --> 00:14:55,739
l'd like a little something to eat.

208
00:14:55,808 --> 00:14:58,436
Nice going, junkie. Here's your yum-yums.

209
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:05,282
So much for him.
l don't want you girls to worry.

210
00:15:05,518 --> 00:15:09,454
l mean, we just wanted some company.
That's all, you know.

211
00:15:10,256 --> 00:15:12,724
lt wasn't that expensive at all.

212
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,517
Looks good.

213
00:15:22,568 --> 00:15:26,436
-This room belongs in a magazine.
-Not bad, if l do say so.

214
00:15:35,114 --> 00:15:37,639
l feel like a bridegroom. l'm hearing bells.

215
00:15:37,717 --> 00:15:40,880
l have a cake in the oven. Come on.

216
00:15:40,953 --> 00:15:42,045
A cake?

217
00:15:43,089 --> 00:15:45,489
You wanted some grass?

218
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:49,988
What do you want with some grass?

219
00:15:51,497 --> 00:15:53,465
You guys ain't cows, is ya?

220
00:15:53,532 --> 00:15:56,729
Little cows looking for some grass?

221
00:15:57,536 --> 00:16:00,004
Let me hear you moo. Come on.

222
00:16:02,508 --> 00:16:04,976
But they got those
cute little udders on them.

223
00:16:05,044 --> 00:16:09,310
You guys let us the hell out of here,
or l'm going to start screaming!

224
00:16:19,225 --> 00:16:21,193
You're gonna scream?

225
00:16:21,861 --> 00:16:23,260
Listen.

226
00:16:24,096 --> 00:16:27,190
Let me give you a little bit of free advice...

227
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:30,494
...if you make one peep....

228
00:17:12,545 --> 00:17:14,445
Cockeyed as hell.

229
00:17:15,014 --> 00:17:18,745
l should have bought one at the bakery.
They have such pretty ones there.

230
00:17:18,818 --> 00:17:21,651
Nonsense. lt's truly remarkable.

231
00:17:21,721 --> 00:17:23,313
Come on in the living room.

232
00:17:23,389 --> 00:17:25,186
l want to attack you.

233
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:31,461
Listen. Why don't you guys let us go?
We know you were just kidding around.

234
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:35,125
We'll split, and we won't say
anything to anybody. l swear.

235
00:17:36,335 --> 00:17:38,826
You must think we're pretty stupid.

236
00:17:39,939 --> 00:17:41,338
No.

237
00:17:44,276 --> 00:17:46,039
We ain't stupid.

238
00:17:48,114 --> 00:17:50,139
We might be...

239
00:17:51,617 --> 00:17:53,346
...horny old pigs...

240
00:17:53,786 --> 00:17:57,381
...but we ain't stupid.

241
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:04,220
-Get your hands away.
-Come on. l had her first. Please.

242
00:18:04,296 --> 00:18:06,457
l said get your hands away, bitch!

243
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:13,768
Chicken breast.

244
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,905
Phyllis!

245
00:18:17,543 --> 00:18:19,511
Do that again, and you're dead.

246
00:18:19,578 --> 00:18:21,375
Easy, Weasel.

247
00:18:21,714 --> 00:18:24,911
We don't want to off somebody
the first night out.

248
00:18:26,986 --> 00:18:30,581
Be a shame to get this floor
all messed up with blood.

249
00:18:32,491 --> 00:18:34,220
Be so messy.

250
00:18:39,565 --> 00:18:41,931
There are other ways to do things.

251
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,137
No!

252
00:18:52,978 --> 00:18:54,639
Stop it.

253
00:19:04,623 --> 00:19:07,558
Castle's ready. Here's to the princess.

254
00:19:08,594 --> 00:19:10,323
To the princess!

255
00:19:19,605 --> 00:19:21,197
To her queen.

256
00:19:44,597 --> 00:19:45,894
Come on!

257
00:20:14,026 --> 00:20:16,995
Okay, sweetheart,
l'll put you right on top of your friend.

258
00:20:17,062 --> 00:20:19,530
-Take it easy, you could hurt 'em.
-They're okay.

259
00:20:19,598 --> 00:20:22,999
Okay, the both of you settle down,
you got a long ride ahead.

260
00:20:23,168 --> 00:20:25,136
l'm outta here.

261
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:36,570
Yes.

262
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:39,413
-It's pretty common, you know?
-Yes, l understand.

263
00:20:39,485 --> 00:20:41,646
-Sure she hasn't called?
-No, she hasn't.

264
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:46,851
-Sorry I couldn't have been of more help.
-Thank you very much. You're very kind.

265
00:20:46,959 --> 00:20:48,620
Goodbye.

266
00:20:52,298 --> 00:20:53,526
Nothing?

267
00:20:54,099 --> 00:20:58,160
The theater manager said the concert
was over at 2:00 this morning.

268
00:20:59,438 --> 00:21:00,928
lt's dawn now.

269
00:21:02,041 --> 00:21:04,407
We'll wait an hour,
then we'll call the police.

270
00:21:04,476 --> 00:21:08,810
Come on! Things are not that bad.
At least we have our phone again.

271
00:21:09,181 --> 00:21:12,241
She's all right. Staying out all night.

272
00:21:12,952 --> 00:21:14,579
lt's classic.

273
00:21:14,653 --> 00:21:16,814
lt's a kid's way of saying she's grown up.

274
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:19,153
lt's that damned Phyllis Stone's fault.

275
00:21:19,224 --> 00:21:23,558
Don't! She'll come home.
Let her have her fling.

276
00:22:25,491 --> 00:22:30,155
Taking them girls, that's the kind of crime
people never forgive you for.

277
00:22:30,562 --> 00:22:32,086
Sex crime.

278
00:22:32,197 --> 00:22:34,222
Shut up! You're disturbing my rhythm.

279
00:22:34,299 --> 00:22:37,234
How did we get into
this sex crime business, anyway?

280
00:22:37,302 --> 00:22:40,965
My brother Sol, the plumber,
he makes twice as much money as me...

281
00:22:41,040 --> 00:22:42,905
...and gets three weeks vacation, too.

282
00:22:42,975 --> 00:22:44,840
Shut up, shithead!

283
00:22:46,879 --> 00:22:49,313
You think the cops is closing in on us?

284
00:22:49,381 --> 00:22:52,111
l just got this feeling
at the back of my neck.

285
00:22:52,184 --> 00:22:54,152
Maybe you got crabs.

286
00:23:13,238 --> 00:23:18,073
l wonder what the meanest, foulest,
rottenest, raunchiest sex crime ever was.

287
00:23:18,143 --> 00:23:22,079
Sadie! What do you think
the sex crime of the century was?

288
00:23:22,715 --> 00:23:23,704
Shit!

289
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:25,914
l'm serious!

290
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:28,986
l ought to kill you.

291
00:23:44,536 --> 00:23:47,096
How 'bout the Boston Strangler?
l always admired him.

292
00:23:47,172 --> 00:23:48,969
-Bush league!
-l've got it!

293
00:23:49,074 --> 00:23:51,565
-You sure?
-Yeah! Frood!

294
00:23:52,144 --> 00:23:54,738
-Frood?
-Sigmund Frood!

295
00:23:54,813 --> 00:23:58,647
Do you remember when a telephone pole
was just a telephone pole?

296
00:23:58,884 --> 00:24:02,047
-Yeah.
-Not anymore, sweetheart.

297
00:24:02,387 --> 00:24:04,355
lt's a giant puh-hay-lis.

298
00:24:04,456 --> 00:24:05,616
Puh-hay-lis?

299
00:24:05,924 --> 00:24:09,416
l can't even look at the Grand Canyon
anymore without crossing my legs.

300
00:24:09,495 --> 00:24:10,792
That's bullshit.

301
00:24:12,431 --> 00:24:14,262
This icing is delicious.

302
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:18,194
You must get a lot of hysterical parents
calling you now, Sheriff?

303
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:21,262
-lt's not that unusual, Mrs. Collingwood.
-Oh?

304
00:24:21,573 --> 00:24:24,804
We've gotten lots of calls like this
in the past few years.

305
00:24:24,877 --> 00:24:27,539
Kids running off to the big city
for a few days.

306
00:24:27,613 --> 00:24:30,878
Our chances are that Mari will be back
before supper.

307
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:33,448
Still, it's wise of you to call us.

308
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:35,544
At least all our phones are working.

309
00:24:39,892 --> 00:24:41,860
That's just great!

310
00:24:41,927 --> 00:24:46,057
We're a million miles from nowhere, too!
King car of the road!

311
00:24:46,131 --> 00:24:48,531
-All right, what's the matter?
-lt stopped!

312
00:24:50,335 --> 00:24:52,633
l think l've found the trouble.

313
00:24:53,005 --> 00:24:55,803
This thing pulled out,
and it's all covered with oil.

314
00:24:55,874 --> 00:24:58,434
Christ, didn't they teach you nothing
in reform school?

315
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:00,410
Take it easy on him, he's just a kid.

316
00:25:00,479 --> 00:25:04,711
l know, but when l was his age,
l could fix any car in two seconds.

317
00:25:06,151 --> 00:25:08,585
Hey, Krug. Where the hell are we?

318
00:25:09,521 --> 00:25:13,287
l just have the strangest feeling
we should be doing something more.

319
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:16,027
Now, hold on.

320
00:25:16,094 --> 00:25:19,928
My deputy Harry,
he's down there in the radio car.

321
00:25:19,998 --> 00:25:22,023
He's calling New York right now.

322
00:25:22,134 --> 00:25:25,968
And if we hear anything....
Here he is right now.

323
00:25:28,807 --> 00:25:30,001
What did you hear?

324
00:25:30,075 --> 00:25:32,805
New York police don't have
anybody of her description...

325
00:25:32,878 --> 00:25:34,778
...in jail or on ice.

326
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,072
lt's their term.

327
00:25:36,148 --> 00:25:39,049
Guy in the morgue says
he hasn't had a kid on ice all day.

328
00:25:39,184 --> 00:25:41,277
First time in five years.

329
00:25:41,653 --> 00:25:43,518
ls that the last of the cake?

330
00:25:47,059 --> 00:25:51,723
There's a tool kit in the trunk.
l want you to start this goddamn car.

331
00:25:55,167 --> 00:25:56,998
Bitch! She bit me!

332
00:25:57,069 --> 00:25:59,537
This ain't getting us out of the state.

333
00:25:59,605 --> 00:26:02,540
She bit me! That bitch bit me!

334
00:26:03,075 --> 00:26:06,408
Weasel, we're gonna have a little fun.

335
00:26:06,478 --> 00:26:08,537
Car's on the blink, Weasel.

336
00:26:08,614 --> 00:26:10,912
-No.
-And while we've got you brats along....

337
00:26:10,983 --> 00:26:12,473
What are you gonna do?

338
00:26:12,551 --> 00:26:16,817
We ain't going to be able to call
a mechanic, go to a gas station, nothing.

339
00:26:18,857 --> 00:26:22,384
We'll get the phone in service
so we can get a call from her.

340
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:23,826
lt'll be all right.

341
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:28,629
Kids get ants in their pants sometimes.
She's just letting off a little steam.

342
00:26:37,876 --> 00:26:39,434
Come on, there!

343
00:26:46,652 --> 00:26:48,347
Dig these crazy woods here.

344
00:26:54,226 --> 00:26:56,091
Come on, Junior.

345
00:26:57,930 --> 00:26:59,488
Move it.

346
00:26:59,932 --> 00:27:01,729
Go to the right, down by the water.

347
00:27:05,404 --> 00:27:08,567
-Who do you suppose that is?
-l don't recognize it.

348
00:27:08,974 --> 00:27:11,670
-Looks like someone got stuck.
-Want to go have a look?

349
00:27:11,743 --> 00:27:15,144
No. Come on, let's go, kid.
We've got more important things to do.

350
00:27:15,213 --> 00:27:18,808
That ain't going to find us
Mari Collingwood.

351
00:27:23,956 --> 00:27:26,015
Weasel, take out your knife.

352
00:27:31,430 --> 00:27:35,196
l'm gonna tell this little lady here
to do something.

353
00:27:36,735 --> 00:27:40,000
And if she doesn't do exactly
what l tell her to...

354
00:27:40,505 --> 00:27:42,871
...l want you to cut her...

355
00:27:43,909 --> 00:27:45,376
...friend.

356
00:27:45,444 --> 00:27:46,672
Oh, brother!

357
00:27:46,745 --> 00:27:49,145
-Untie them.
-Come on.

358
00:27:50,515 --> 00:27:52,608
He's talking to you.

359
00:27:57,689 --> 00:27:59,350
Come here.

360
00:28:06,198 --> 00:28:08,098
Piss your pants.

361
00:28:10,969 --> 00:28:12,834
Piss your pants!

362
00:28:12,938 --> 00:28:15,532
l said, piss your pants.

363
00:28:16,842 --> 00:28:18,935
You sick mother!

364
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:23,609
Phyllis, he cut me.

365
00:28:24,383 --> 00:28:26,351
Piss your pants.

366
00:28:28,453 --> 00:28:29,784
Do it!

367
00:28:30,756 --> 00:28:32,451
Watch her pee.

368
00:28:33,358 --> 00:28:35,223
She's doing it.

369
00:28:36,294 --> 00:28:38,592
Look at that!

370
00:28:41,099 --> 00:28:42,862
Oh, God! Hell!

371
00:28:43,001 --> 00:28:44,901
That's beautiful.

372
00:28:47,506 --> 00:28:49,440
Now, take them off.

373
00:28:53,512 --> 00:28:54,911
l said, take them off!

374
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,572
You're so sick!

375
00:29:00,986 --> 00:29:03,352
Yeah! Take them off!

376
00:29:04,322 --> 00:29:07,052
-l told you about her.
-She's got lovely legs.

377
00:29:07,125 --> 00:29:10,151
This is really a riot, man! l dig it!

378
00:29:10,395 --> 00:29:13,956
-Take them off! Take it all off.
-She got her little panties all stained.

379
00:29:14,032 --> 00:29:16,796
Can we get Weasel a pair of those pants?

380
00:29:16,868 --> 00:29:19,098
Do you want a pair of those pants, Weasel?

381
00:29:19,471 --> 00:29:22,304
How about some
with a couple of hearts on them?

382
00:29:22,374 --> 00:29:27,141
-She's got a good-looking ass on her.
-Come on, we're going to play. Up we go.

383
00:29:27,212 --> 00:29:28,839
Hit her.

384
00:29:29,915 --> 00:29:30,973
Hard!

385
00:29:31,483 --> 00:29:33,075
Sock it to her, baby.

386
00:29:33,518 --> 00:29:36,146
l said, hit her.

387
00:29:37,122 --> 00:29:38,646
l'm sorry, Mari.

388
00:29:39,157 --> 00:29:41,421
-ln the stomach with all your might.
-Stop it!

389
00:29:41,626 --> 00:29:44,459
You're gonna kill someone
if you're not careful.

390
00:29:44,529 --> 00:29:46,656
-What the hell are you doing?
-Oh, shit!

391
00:29:46,731 --> 00:29:48,631
You guys got to be crazy, man.

392
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:51,225
lf you're not careful,
you're gonna kill someone.

393
00:29:51,303 --> 00:29:52,998
Make them make it with each other!

394
00:29:53,071 --> 00:29:56,529
-That's a good idea!
-Make it with each other.

395
00:29:56,641 --> 00:29:58,165
Too sick, man.

396
00:29:59,277 --> 00:30:02,405
Loosen her up a little bit. Wait a minute.

397
00:30:03,949 --> 00:30:05,746
Come on. Don't worry about it.

398
00:30:05,817 --> 00:30:08,718
You'll have plenty of time to feel the pain.

399
00:30:08,787 --> 00:30:12,086
Weasel here is a specialist with a twist.

400
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:18,557
Do it!

401
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,198
Get it off!

402
00:30:31,042 --> 00:30:32,839
Leave her alone!

403
00:30:37,349 --> 00:30:38,873
Come on.

404
00:30:40,552 --> 00:30:43,885
-We've got to do it.
-l can't.

405
00:30:49,961 --> 00:30:51,952
l know it's sick.

406
00:30:52,597 --> 00:30:54,428
But it's okay.

407
00:30:59,971 --> 00:31:02,735
lt's sick. But it's okay.

408
00:31:03,909 --> 00:31:08,243
lt's just you and me here. Nobody else.
Just you and me, okay?

409
00:31:29,668 --> 00:31:33,729
-lt's all right. We're not going to hurt you.
-You already hurt her!

410
00:31:33,805 --> 00:31:36,137
What do you think you're doing!

411
00:31:38,143 --> 00:31:40,907
No, Doc Collingwood,
still no word on Mari.

412
00:31:40,979 --> 00:31:44,142
But we'll letyou knowjust as soon
as we hearsomething.

413
00:31:44,449 --> 00:31:45,381
Yes, sir.

414
00:31:49,154 --> 00:31:51,088
l'm glad you got your phone fixed.

415
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:54,782
You just stick right by that phone
'cause she might call.

416
00:31:54,859 --> 00:31:57,726
-I'm holding you personally responsible.
-Yes, sir.

417
00:31:57,963 --> 00:32:00,022
-Call me if anything comes up.
-Okay.

418
00:32:00,098 --> 00:32:01,725
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

419
00:32:04,936 --> 00:32:08,064
Hot damn,
l wish l was something else sometimes.

420
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:10,573
You mean, like a duck or something?

421
00:32:13,812 --> 00:32:18,374
No, you damn fool! l mean something else
besides being a policeman.

422
00:32:18,883 --> 00:32:22,751
Doc Collingwood again?

423
00:32:24,089 --> 00:32:26,990
l bet she shacked up
with Wilbur Cranshaw.

424
00:32:27,492 --> 00:32:28,925
That shows what you know.

425
00:32:28,994 --> 00:32:32,020
Wilbur's gone up to Coopersburg
with Sweet Lily.

426
00:32:32,197 --> 00:32:36,827
-Who the hell is Sweet Lily?
-lt's his pig. He went up to Coopersburg.

427
00:32:37,102 --> 00:32:40,094
He's gonna enter her in some fair up there.

428
00:32:40,305 --> 00:32:42,796
Wilbur always was a little strange.

429
00:32:44,576 --> 00:32:47,670
l remember he left town real sudden
once before.

430
00:32:48,213 --> 00:32:51,410
Just before his collie came down
with a litter of pups.

431
00:32:55,353 --> 00:32:57,344
l'm going up to the car...

432
00:32:57,422 --> 00:33:01,085
...to see if l can find something
to cut some firewood with.

433
00:33:01,459 --> 00:33:02,585
Firewood?

434
00:33:02,661 --> 00:33:05,824
You know. Heat things up a little bit.

435
00:33:11,202 --> 00:33:13,602
You can handle things while l'm gone,
can't you?

436
00:33:13,738 --> 00:33:15,137
Sure.

437
00:33:26,851 --> 00:33:28,648
Listen. l'm really cold.

438
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,688
Would it be okay if l put on my clothes?

439
00:33:30,755 --> 00:33:33,690
Just till Krug comes back. l'm really cold.

440
00:33:36,661 --> 00:33:38,060
Okay?

441
00:33:38,129 --> 00:33:39,118
Go ahead.

442
00:34:02,354 --> 00:34:06,450
Listen. l'm gonna make a run for it.

443
00:34:06,524 --> 00:34:10,551
When they go after me,
you go and get help. Okay?

444
00:34:10,762 --> 00:34:12,389
Okay.

445
00:34:14,632 --> 00:34:16,862
You want to play? Junior!

446
00:34:18,436 --> 00:34:22,202
Watch that other girl.
Don't let nothing happen to her.

447
00:34:32,684 --> 00:34:34,481
l'm going to get you!

448
00:34:56,408 --> 00:34:59,809
Man. l've got to give up cigarettes.

449
00:34:59,878 --> 00:35:03,473
-Shut up!
-Junior? ls that your real name?

450
00:35:03,548 --> 00:35:06,608
l told you to shut up, or l'll slap you silly.

451
00:35:06,684 --> 00:35:09,016
l'm gonna give you another name. Willow.

452
00:35:09,087 --> 00:35:11,180
Willow.

453
00:35:11,256 --> 00:35:15,158
Because you're kind of beautiful,
and you shake when the wind blows.

454
00:35:15,226 --> 00:35:17,456
-Krug is the wind.
-Let me alone.

455
00:35:18,997 --> 00:35:21,465
Krug's gonna really be pissed off
we lost her.

456
00:35:21,533 --> 00:35:23,899
Split up, okay? Go that way.

457
00:35:54,699 --> 00:35:56,064
You bitch! Slow down!

458
00:35:56,134 --> 00:35:58,466
Willow, do you have a girlfriend?

459
00:35:58,536 --> 00:36:01,937
Sure, l've got lots of girlfriends
just waiting to get me.

460
00:36:02,006 --> 00:36:04,736
-l don't think you do.
-You're right.

461
00:36:04,876 --> 00:36:08,004
-l want to give you something.
-l don't want that.

462
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,309
-lt's worth a lot. See?
-l don't want it.

463
00:36:10,381 --> 00:36:12,975
-l want to be your friend.
-You want to get free.

464
00:36:13,051 --> 00:36:15,315
-l want to be your friend.
-Where'd she go?

465
00:36:15,386 --> 00:36:18,287
l want to be your friend.
l can get you a fix.

466
00:36:22,794 --> 00:36:25,524
-You can get me a fix?
-You'd like that.

467
00:36:25,597 --> 00:36:27,565
-l'd like it.
-Sadie! Over there!

468
00:36:27,632 --> 00:36:29,759
My father, he works with addicts.

469
00:36:29,834 --> 00:36:34,294
He's got it in his house.
lt's here. l can get you methadone.

470
00:36:34,372 --> 00:36:35,999
Just as quick as that.

471
00:36:36,241 --> 00:36:38,732
Really! Come on, let's get out of here.

472
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:40,707
-What, are you crazy?
-l live over there.

473
00:36:40,778 --> 00:36:43,645
l live across the street. Come on, please!

474
00:36:43,715 --> 00:36:48,448
-l can't leave! Krug will kill me.
-Not if you're not here.

475
00:37:06,704 --> 00:37:08,365
Row, creep!

476
00:37:16,748 --> 00:37:18,739
Son of a bitch.

477
00:37:20,318 --> 00:37:23,048
Attention all townships.

478
00:37:23,121 --> 00:37:25,453
We got a late bulletin on the fugitives...

479
00:37:25,523 --> 00:37:28,890
...Krug Stillo and Weasel Podowski
and their two accomplices.

480
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:31,722
State police got
a gas station attendantin Riverdale.

481
00:37:31,796 --> 00:37:34,856
Says he gassed them up
and gave them directions to Corrington.

482
00:37:34,933 --> 00:37:37,367
-They're up our way!
-Boys downstate reckon they...

483
00:37:37,435 --> 00:37:39,665
...might be coming our way,
heading for Canada.

484
00:37:39,737 --> 00:37:43,070
Once again, description of that
escape vehicle as follows...

485
00:37:43,141 --> 00:37:46,167
...dark green 1958 Cadillac convertible...

486
00:37:46,244 --> 00:37:49,577
...bearing license plate number E2546.

487
00:37:49,714 --> 00:37:51,409
Repeat, Edna 25....

488
00:37:52,984 --> 00:37:54,815
How long does it take to get to there?

489
00:37:54,886 --> 00:37:57,616
-About 25 minutes.
-Make it 15.

490
00:38:42,967 --> 00:38:46,801
lf you would just relax, listen,
l can help you. l'll get you out of this.

491
00:38:46,871 --> 00:38:49,840
-You stupid dyke!
-Sadie!

492
00:38:52,977 --> 00:38:55,241
l'm gonna kill you.

493
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:01,983
-You all right?
-l'm okay. Let me up.

494
00:39:24,509 --> 00:39:26,636
Come on! There she is!

495
00:41:08,946 --> 00:41:11,437
l'm gonna kill that bitch.

496
00:42:02,934 --> 00:42:05,596
-Feel better now?
-l'm okay.

497
00:42:06,037 --> 00:42:09,632
-How did she get so close to the road?
-She threw some dirt in my face.

498
00:42:09,707 --> 00:42:11,766
We caught her.
What are you worried about?

499
00:42:27,658 --> 00:42:29,717
Goddamn car stopped.

500
00:42:31,829 --> 00:42:34,195
You're out of gas, you idiot!

501
00:42:35,766 --> 00:42:37,461
Out of gas?

502
00:42:37,535 --> 00:42:39,127
God damn!

503
00:42:50,481 --> 00:42:53,473
See. l told you she wasn't going far.

504
00:43:20,444 --> 00:43:22,469
How's your back, baby?

505
00:44:03,287 --> 00:44:06,723
-Phyllis!
-Oh, Christ.

506
00:44:08,726 --> 00:44:09,818
Junior!

507
00:44:09,894 --> 00:44:12,488
-You said my name was Willow.
-Willow, then!

508
00:44:12,563 --> 00:44:15,259
You've got to be a man
and do something for once.

509
00:44:15,333 --> 00:44:19,292
What would you do if you were me?

510
00:44:19,370 --> 00:44:20,962
Fuck!

511
00:44:47,498 --> 00:44:49,523
They're coming after us.

512
00:44:58,509 --> 00:45:00,568
Going somewhere?

513
00:45:07,651 --> 00:45:08,982
Phyllis?

514
00:45:11,956 --> 00:45:13,821
Did she get away?

515
00:45:47,792 --> 00:45:51,353
-Pigs! Get outta here.
-We hate cops!

516
00:45:52,263 --> 00:45:53,855
God damn!

517
00:45:58,335 --> 00:45:59,859
Damn hippies!

518
00:46:11,015 --> 00:46:12,676
What do you think?

519
00:46:14,485 --> 00:46:17,318
''K-R-U-G.

520
00:46:17,922 --> 00:46:20,186
''Krug.'' That's really nice.

521
00:46:27,965 --> 00:46:31,526
You're gonna get yours.
You are really gonna get yours.

522
00:46:32,770 --> 00:46:34,567
Little woolly.

523
00:47:58,956 --> 00:48:00,821
''Now l lay me down to sleep

524
00:48:01,892 --> 00:48:03,792
''l pray the Lord my soul to keep

525
00:48:04,995 --> 00:48:06,895
''lf l shall die before l wake

526
00:48:08,232 --> 00:48:10,792
''l pray the Lord my soul to take''

527
00:50:31,508 --> 00:50:32,702
Junior!

528
00:50:33,277 --> 00:50:36,041
Go up to the car and get the suitcases.

529
00:50:37,081 --> 00:50:39,311
Let's get washed up
and the hell out of here.

530
00:50:39,383 --> 00:50:41,442
Let's do that.

531
00:50:50,227 --> 00:50:54,220
Good grief. We've been walking
for nigh on an hour now.

532
00:50:55,466 --> 00:50:58,435
lt's 7:00 and we've still got
a good 10 miles to go.

533
00:50:58,502 --> 00:51:02,029
lf you've got any better ideas,
you just come right out with them.

534
00:51:02,106 --> 00:51:05,439
'Cause l can't think of any other way
to get from here to there...

535
00:51:05,509 --> 00:51:08,478
...or any other place either,
without riding or walking.

536
00:51:08,545 --> 00:51:12,538
And since riding is out, thanks to you,
you lame brain...

537
00:51:12,616 --> 00:51:15,881
...then walking is the only thing that's left.

538
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,719
Listen.

539
00:51:18,822 --> 00:51:21,552
-What?
-l hear something.

540
00:51:23,327 --> 00:51:25,795
All l hear is you, you damn fool.

541
00:51:29,066 --> 00:51:32,001
Who the hell do you think you are? Tonto?

542
00:51:33,103 --> 00:51:34,900
lt's a truck.

543
00:51:36,607 --> 00:51:38,472
And some chickens, too.

544
00:51:39,376 --> 00:51:40,775
Chickens?

545
00:51:41,712 --> 00:51:44,510
l only tell you what the road tells me.

546
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:02,793
Listen, Ada, we've got a problem here.
This is serious business.

547
00:52:02,866 --> 00:52:05,494
We've got to get to
the Collingwood place right away.

548
00:52:05,569 --> 00:52:09,505
This is police business,
and this is an emergency, you hear?

549
00:52:10,073 --> 00:52:13,702
-Can you help us out?
-Have to ride on the roof.

550
00:52:14,478 --> 00:52:18,005
-On the roof?
-lt's the only place l have any room.

551
00:52:31,361 --> 00:52:33,090
Fasten your seatbelts!

552
00:52:33,564 --> 00:52:36,192
Proceed. Now listen, Harry...

553
00:52:36,266 --> 00:52:41,465
...if you tell any of the boys at the lodge
about this, l'm gonna fix your wagon.

554
00:52:44,374 --> 00:52:46,433
God damn.

555
00:52:54,618 --> 00:52:58,611
-What in thunder's goin' on here, Ada?
-lt's got its maximum load.

556
00:52:58,689 --> 00:53:01,487
l couldn't get another chicken on here
without it stalling.

557
00:53:01,558 --> 00:53:05,790
And now l've got you two on here,
and you two ain't chickens!

558
00:53:05,863 --> 00:53:08,024
This truck won't start with us on it?

559
00:53:08,098 --> 00:53:10,430
-You said it!
-Listen.

560
00:53:10,501 --> 00:53:13,937
You're gonna have to take some
chickens off that truck and let us on.

561
00:53:14,004 --> 00:53:17,667
-How much do you weigh, Deputy?
-185. Why?

562
00:53:17,774 --> 00:53:20,004
-How much you weigh, Sheriff?
-About 180.

563
00:53:20,077 --> 00:53:21,169
Bullshit.

564
00:53:21,245 --> 00:53:23,645
Maybe 190.
l don't weigh myself every morning.

565
00:53:23,714 --> 00:53:27,172
That's 11 crates of chickens.
And that ain't hay.

566
00:53:27,718 --> 00:53:29,413
Now look.

567
00:53:29,753 --> 00:53:34,520
You know l'm a solemnly sworn officer
of the law? l got the law on my side.

568
00:53:34,591 --> 00:53:38,721
And l got the chickens and the truck!

569
00:53:52,643 --> 00:53:53,837
Water!

570
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:58,479
You found water, chief.

571
00:54:04,521 --> 00:54:07,922
-Still got some in your eye.
-You get it.

572
00:54:09,393 --> 00:54:10,826
How's that?

573
00:54:14,064 --> 00:54:16,089
Did l get everything?

574
00:54:20,904 --> 00:54:22,599
-Am l clean?
-Help me out of here.

575
00:54:22,673 --> 00:54:24,334
-Am l clean?
-Yeah.

576
00:54:28,712 --> 00:54:30,339
Atta girl!

577
00:54:34,885 --> 00:54:38,480
-Have a look, Sadie. ls my tie okay?
-Beautiful, baby!

578
00:54:40,357 --> 00:54:42,587
-Gee, thanks!
-You're welcome.

579
00:54:57,608 --> 00:54:59,803
-John!
-l'm in here!

580
00:55:03,013 --> 00:55:04,571
We've got guests.

581
00:55:05,649 --> 00:55:08,379
-l'm sorry.
-Guests! Who is it?

582
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,049
Get your foot off the table!

583
00:55:12,122 --> 00:55:15,285
Being in this house
makes me wish l was a lady.

584
00:55:16,326 --> 00:55:19,420
This place is in the middle of nowhere,
you know that?

585
00:55:19,663 --> 00:55:24,498
-What are you doing with the Holy Bible?
-''Dearly beloved, we are gathered here....''

586
00:55:35,846 --> 00:55:38,679
-Weasel. What are you doing?
-Nothing.

587
00:55:38,749 --> 00:55:42,742
Who in the world is it?
l didn't know anyone was coming over.

588
00:55:45,555 --> 00:55:49,685
John, l want you to meet Harvey Wilson
and his wife, Dorothy.

589
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,887
-How are you?
-Sam Hardy.

590
00:55:52,796 --> 00:55:56,061
-And Dave Rizalski.
-David.

591
00:55:56,600 --> 00:56:00,229
Do you know their car broke down
right out front?

592
00:56:00,537 --> 00:56:04,029
-Anything serious?
-l'm afraid we blew a rod.

593
00:56:04,141 --> 00:56:07,008
-Oh no.
-Willie's Esso station is the only garage...

594
00:56:07,077 --> 00:56:09,841
...l know, and they close at 6:00.

595
00:56:10,013 --> 00:56:13,073
lt wouldn't make any difference.
The phone is still dead.

596
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:15,584
They wanted a ride to a motel, but l said...

597
00:56:15,652 --> 00:56:18,450
-...that would be up to you--
-Mari still has the car.

598
00:56:18,522 --> 00:56:20,319
lt's okay, we've got plenty of room.

599
00:56:20,390 --> 00:56:25,885
Why, we have a perfectly good guest room.
And there's Mari's room, l suppose.

600
00:56:25,962 --> 00:56:28,294
Are you sure
we're not a bother to you folks?

601
00:56:28,365 --> 00:56:31,425
Nonsense! Our home is yours.
Let me get your bags.

602
00:56:31,501 --> 00:56:34,095
No! Jun-- Frank, here, is...

603
00:56:34,971 --> 00:56:37,201
...younger. He can handle it.

604
00:56:38,341 --> 00:56:41,435
Why don't l show you to your rooms?
Come on.

605
00:56:51,588 --> 00:56:55,490
Here, and through there. Okay?

606
00:56:55,559 --> 00:57:00,394
l'll put some towels in the bathroom
for you, and you can wash up if you like.

607
00:57:00,864 --> 00:57:03,458
-Bacon and eggs in the morning?
-Thank you. Marvelous.

608
00:57:03,533 --> 00:57:07,697
Well, we'll be in the living room,
and you can join us if you like.

609
00:57:07,804 --> 00:57:11,205
-Just make yourselves comfortable.
-Much obliged.

610
00:57:20,984 --> 00:57:22,884
Come on!

611
00:57:24,221 --> 00:57:25,688
Very nice.

612
00:57:27,424 --> 00:57:29,756
The lady of the house is nice, too.

613
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:33,418
-Krug. l want my fix, man.
-Go jump!

614
00:57:33,797 --> 00:57:35,560
-Krug?
-Yeah?

615
00:57:37,100 --> 00:57:38,533
Look at this.

616
00:57:40,537 --> 00:57:41,765
What?

617
00:57:44,875 --> 00:57:46,866
Guess who lives here?

618
00:57:51,014 --> 00:57:53,676
l wonder what the odds are on that.

619
00:58:11,268 --> 00:58:14,533
Feel like playing ''Three-Thirds of a Ghost''
or something?

620
00:58:14,604 --> 00:58:18,233
How would you like me to put
my boot up your ass sideways?

621
00:58:20,977 --> 00:58:24,413
l'm sorry l don't have anything better
to offer you, but....

622
00:58:24,781 --> 00:58:28,945
-lt's been such a confusing day.
-Hell, you've got a lot to offer.

623
00:58:29,319 --> 00:58:31,651
This food is impeccable.

624
00:59:04,588 --> 00:59:06,488
Are you folks on vacation?

625
00:59:06,556 --> 00:59:10,993
-No. We're sort of on a business trip.
-What sort of business are you in?

626
00:59:11,494 --> 00:59:13,291
-Plumbing.
-lnsurance.

627
00:59:14,264 --> 00:59:16,027
Well, which is it?

628
00:59:16,967 --> 00:59:19,265
You see, we're actually in both.

629
00:59:19,536 --> 00:59:22,266
We sell insurance to plumbing companies.

630
00:59:22,339 --> 00:59:25,775
You know, in case they steal
some toilets or something.

631
00:59:34,918 --> 00:59:36,715
Junior....

632
00:59:39,956 --> 00:59:41,048
Stop it!

633
00:59:44,427 --> 00:59:45,416
WillowI

634
00:59:46,196 --> 00:59:47,754
You're gonna kill someone.

635
00:59:50,567 --> 00:59:52,694
Willow....

636
00:59:55,639 --> 00:59:56,970
l'm sorry.

637
00:59:57,707 --> 00:59:59,971
You don't mind if l smoke, do you?

638
01:00:00,677 --> 01:00:02,076
l'm sorry!

639
01:00:09,152 --> 01:00:12,315
Shut up, you little creep!
l should've killed you at the lake!

640
01:00:12,389 --> 01:00:15,153
Shut up!
You're worse than your goddamn mother!

641
01:00:16,459 --> 01:00:20,725
You see, Dave upstairs, he lost
one of our biggest accounts last week.

642
01:00:20,897 --> 01:00:23,195
lnternational Bathtub and Sink.

643
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:27,269
$500,000 account,
down the drain, so to speak.

644
01:00:28,104 --> 01:00:32,370
He kind of takes all the blame on himself.
Hasn't got over it yet.

645
01:00:32,442 --> 01:00:33,932
Any more spaghetti left?

646
01:00:40,450 --> 01:00:43,078
Goddamn high-class, tight-ass freakos.

647
01:00:44,721 --> 01:00:46,916
All that goddamn silverware.

648
01:00:47,657 --> 01:00:50,148
Who do they think they are, anyway?

649
01:00:50,360 --> 01:00:52,521
People in China eating with sticks...

650
01:00:52,595 --> 01:00:56,326
...and these creeps got 16 utensils
for every pea on the plate.

651
01:00:58,635 --> 01:01:00,125
Take it easy.

652
01:01:03,506 --> 01:01:06,498
lt don't make no matter,
one way or the other.

653
01:01:08,111 --> 01:01:10,409
Where's that goddamn son of mine?

654
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:12,744
He's taking a piss, or something.

655
01:01:13,583 --> 01:01:15,574
Did you get him his fix?

656
01:01:16,753 --> 01:01:18,220
Screw him.

657
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:52,911
ls there anything l can do in there?

658
01:01:56,826 --> 01:01:58,851
-Are you all right?
-Yeah.

659
01:01:59,396 --> 01:02:00,988
l'm fine.

660
01:02:01,598 --> 01:02:03,589
Let me call my husband. He's a doctor.

661
01:02:03,666 --> 01:02:05,293
No, lady, please!

662
01:02:06,936 --> 01:02:08,233
l'm all right.

663
01:02:32,228 --> 01:02:35,356
Easy does it. You okay?

664
01:02:38,435 --> 01:02:39,367
Nuts!

665
01:02:39,436 --> 01:02:41,802
-What the hell you been doing?
-Nothing.

666
01:02:44,074 --> 01:02:47,305
Look, man! l've got to have a fix!

667
01:02:48,344 --> 01:02:49,834
After breakfast.

668
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:15,599
-Krug.
-Yeah?

669
01:03:19,542 --> 01:03:21,271
l want my fix, man.

670
01:03:23,146 --> 01:03:24,841
Look, man! Cut it out!

671
01:03:24,914 --> 01:03:27,178
-l've got to have a fix!
-Screw off.

672
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:29,810
Krug, we gotta get out of here!

673
01:03:29,886 --> 01:03:32,946
-lf they find out we killed their kid--
-You shut up!

674
01:03:33,123 --> 01:03:35,819
Or you'll wind up in the lake with her.

675
01:04:34,217 --> 01:04:36,845
-God, John.
-Jesus Christ!

676
01:04:37,353 --> 01:04:40,015
lsn't there anything we can do for her?

677
01:04:40,390 --> 01:04:41,982
Nothing.

678
01:04:42,458 --> 01:04:44,050
She's dead.

679
01:04:46,996 --> 01:04:48,623
My baby!

680
01:04:49,365 --> 01:04:50,662
Baby.

681
01:05:00,410 --> 01:05:03,641
Don't move. Open your mouth, please.

682
01:05:06,015 --> 01:05:07,414
Don't move.

683
01:05:21,631 --> 01:05:23,292
Open your mouth, please.

684
01:05:23,399 --> 01:05:24,957
-Light.
-Light.

685
01:05:25,802 --> 01:05:29,203
-Chisel.
-Don't move. Chisel.

686
01:05:30,640 --> 01:05:31,902
Hammer.

687
01:05:32,342 --> 01:05:33,639
Hammer.

688
01:05:34,410 --> 01:05:35,536
Wider now.

689
01:05:36,145 --> 01:05:37,544
Wider.

690
01:05:40,483 --> 01:05:41,848
Don't move.

691
01:06:50,853 --> 01:06:52,320
No good.

692
01:07:44,707 --> 01:07:45,935
Hello.

693
01:07:46,776 --> 01:07:48,801
What are you doing up so late?

694
01:07:50,413 --> 01:07:52,506
l thought l heard noises.

695
01:07:53,483 --> 01:07:57,317
But it was just a dog
in the garbage can outside.

696
01:07:59,155 --> 01:08:01,020
l got a little hungry.

697
01:08:02,759 --> 01:08:05,159
Thought l might raid the icebox.

698
01:08:05,228 --> 01:08:07,253
l must say, you....

699
01:08:08,197 --> 01:08:11,530
You do look like a man
with a huge appetite.

700
01:08:11,934 --> 01:08:14,562
All that spaghetti tonight and everything.

701
01:08:14,637 --> 01:08:16,366
That's true.

702
01:08:18,007 --> 01:08:19,167
Where's your husband?

703
01:08:19,242 --> 01:08:22,439
l couldn't help noticing
that your room was empty.

704
01:08:22,812 --> 01:08:23,710
He's there.

705
01:08:41,164 --> 01:08:43,462
He somehow finds me too hard to....

706
01:08:44,934 --> 01:08:47,732
-Well, he's afraid of me.
-You're kidding.

707
01:08:49,105 --> 01:08:51,073
l only wish l was.

708
01:08:51,641 --> 01:08:55,805
l could make love to a looker like you
with my hands tied behind my back.

709
01:08:56,479 --> 01:08:57,912
Let's go over to the couch.

710
01:08:59,749 --> 01:09:01,080
No!

711
01:09:02,385 --> 01:09:04,717
John might hear us and come in.

712
01:09:05,388 --> 01:09:08,084
-Why don't we go outside?
-Outside?

713
01:09:08,191 --> 01:09:09,624
Please.

714
01:09:10,026 --> 01:09:11,550
l want you.

715
01:09:13,529 --> 01:09:15,053
Let's go outside.

716
01:09:16,966 --> 01:09:20,868
l've always dreamed of a man
who could take me easily.

717
01:09:23,105 --> 01:09:24,800
Almost like you said...

718
01:09:26,609 --> 01:09:29,100
...with your hands tied behind your back.

719
01:09:29,178 --> 01:09:33,512
Baby, believe me, l can literally do that.
l'm so super.

720
01:11:02,638 --> 01:11:04,230
Goddamn it.

721
01:11:05,174 --> 01:11:06,436
Here.

722
01:11:06,776 --> 01:11:08,073
Tie me up.

723
01:11:08,544 --> 01:11:10,603
l couldn't!

724
01:11:11,013 --> 01:11:13,811
l thought it was just some girlish fantasy.

725
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:16,882
l know no man could do that.

726
01:11:17,720 --> 01:11:20,621
l said, tie me up.

727
01:11:23,359 --> 01:11:24,690
Well....

728
01:12:13,309 --> 01:12:17,575
Now you just unzip me,
and that's all l'll need you for.

729
01:12:18,214 --> 01:12:19,476
Okay.

730
01:12:23,853 --> 01:12:25,650
You got it caught.

731
01:12:26,355 --> 01:12:29,984
On your little thing! How did l do that?

732
01:12:32,928 --> 01:12:35,294
Shall l just give it a little yank?

733
01:12:35,364 --> 01:12:38,128
Don't do that! Just ease it down.

734
01:12:38,334 --> 01:12:40,029
Nice and easy.

735
01:12:42,838 --> 01:12:44,169
That's it.

736
01:12:44,440 --> 01:12:46,431
Poor little fellow.

737
01:12:46,776 --> 01:12:50,371
lt's not little.
You just scared it, that's all. Just wait.

738
01:13:25,614 --> 01:13:28,082
lf you don't watch it, l'm gonna come.

739
01:13:28,784 --> 01:13:30,877
Please come then, sweetie.

740
01:13:31,821 --> 01:13:35,086
Don't you want me to do you
good and proper?

741
01:13:36,759 --> 01:13:38,590
You can do both...

742
01:13:39,562 --> 01:13:40,995
...can't you?

743
01:13:41,931 --> 01:13:43,330
Hell, yeah!

744
01:13:43,399 --> 01:13:46,391
l can come five or six times
if you want me to.

745
01:13:50,272 --> 01:13:51,603
You bitch.

746
01:13:51,674 --> 01:13:53,608
l think l'm gonna come.

747
01:13:57,046 --> 01:13:58,946
Are you sure, my love?

748
01:14:01,150 --> 01:14:02,617
Sweet mama!

749
01:14:03,152 --> 01:14:04,483
Here l come!

750
01:14:24,507 --> 01:14:27,169
-What's going on?
-l don't know. Shut up.

751
01:14:29,612 --> 01:14:32,775
lt's Weasel.
What the hell has happened to him?

752
01:14:33,349 --> 01:14:36,546
-What's the trouble, Doc?
-Shut your filthy mouth!

753
01:14:36,685 --> 01:14:40,587
Now, take it easy.
Don't do anything l wouldn't do.

754
01:14:46,428 --> 01:14:47,952
Put the lights on!

755
01:14:57,573 --> 01:14:59,131
Son of a bitch.

756
01:15:03,879 --> 01:15:05,107
Boy.

757
01:15:09,752 --> 01:15:12,346
You can do better than that, come on.
Right here.

758
01:15:17,193 --> 01:15:21,095
You're almost as good as Sadie.
Why don't you get something to help you?

759
01:15:21,163 --> 01:15:23,859
Maybe one of the andirons or something.
You know?

760
01:15:24,934 --> 01:15:26,834
Let's even up the odds.

761
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:31,597
Who's this? Hello, there.
You remember me?

762
01:15:36,045 --> 01:15:37,535
Come on.

763
01:15:37,746 --> 01:15:40,681
We're just playing games, now.
We're just beginning.

764
01:15:40,749 --> 01:15:44,310
And what did you do with Weasel?
What did you do with him?

765
01:16:01,003 --> 01:16:02,368
Hello.

766
01:16:02,805 --> 01:16:05,330
What's your name, little angel?

767
01:16:06,942 --> 01:16:08,239
Mari.

768
01:16:08,911 --> 01:16:11,675
She was a lot tougher than you were, Doc.

769
01:16:12,348 --> 01:16:14,282
She took a while to kill.

770
01:16:14,850 --> 01:16:16,681
She was really tough.

771
01:16:16,785 --> 01:16:18,776
We had a hard time with her.

772
01:16:18,888 --> 01:16:21,254
But you're just a pussy!

773
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:27,854
A real pussy.

774
01:16:30,332 --> 01:16:33,324
Come on, now.
You can do better than that.

775
01:16:34,169 --> 01:16:35,864
Just a couple more.

776
01:16:39,141 --> 01:16:41,075
Maybe one more for me.

777
01:16:56,258 --> 01:16:58,226
What the hell are you doing?

778
01:16:58,594 --> 01:17:00,084
You wanna kill me.

779
01:17:00,162 --> 01:17:02,460
-l'll do it.
-Let me help you.

780
01:17:02,531 --> 01:17:03,725
l really will.

781
01:17:03,799 --> 01:17:06,825
l want you to hold the gun out
just like that, see?

782
01:17:06,902 --> 01:17:10,497
You see that little notch in the back?
That little bump in the front?

783
01:17:10,906 --> 01:17:14,398
l want you to kind of get them lined up.
That's right.

784
01:17:14,476 --> 01:17:17,877
You're not shaking that much.
l know you can aim the gun.

785
01:17:18,080 --> 01:17:20,640
Just get them lined up,
and pull the trigger.

786
01:17:20,816 --> 01:17:23,114
Come on. Pull the trigger.

787
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:28,247
-l'm gonna kill you.
-You always were a loser.

788
01:17:29,124 --> 01:17:30,386
Junior...

789
01:17:31,927 --> 01:17:33,861
...l wanna talk to you.

790
01:17:33,929 --> 01:17:35,954
Listen to Daddy. Come on.

791
01:17:36,332 --> 01:17:38,800
l want you to take the gun...

792
01:17:40,536 --> 01:17:42,970
...and l want you to turn around...

793
01:17:43,605 --> 01:17:46,005
...and l want you to put it in your mouth...

794
01:17:46,075 --> 01:17:48,100
...and l want you to blow...

795
01:17:48,177 --> 01:17:51,510
...your brains out!

796
01:17:52,548 --> 01:17:54,914
-No!
-No. Not at me.

797
01:17:56,051 --> 01:18:00,010
l want you to take the gun,
and l want you to put it in your mouth...

798
01:18:00,089 --> 01:18:03,024
-...and l want you to blow your brains out!
-No!

799
01:18:03,092 --> 01:18:05,219
-Blow your brains out!
-No!

800
01:18:05,294 --> 01:18:06,591
Blow your....

801
01:18:55,244 --> 01:18:56,541
Sorry, Krug.

802
01:18:56,779 --> 01:18:59,247
But l could only find one shell.

803
01:19:44,126 --> 01:19:45,855
-Get that guy out of here!
-Sadie!

804
01:19:45,928 --> 01:19:47,691
Get away from me!

805
01:20:14,123 --> 01:20:16,887
You're not going to get away from me!

806
01:20:27,669 --> 01:20:29,364
Get off of me!

807
01:21:09,811 --> 01:21:11,210
Let's just get it over with!

808
01:21:38,907 --> 01:21:40,499
John! For God's sake, don't!
