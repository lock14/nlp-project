2
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:51,225
It's no use, Émile.
The place is like a sieve.

3
00:01:51,394 --> 00:01:55,228
It would take all the rags in Paris
to stuff half its holes.

4
00:01:55,398 --> 00:01:56,922
Paris.

5
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,297
Vast. Motionless.

6
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:04,600
A gigantic mother brooding over her
millions of children, good and bad.

7
00:02:05,775 --> 00:02:08,835
It's magnificent, Cézanne.
You must paint it.

8
00:02:09,012 --> 00:02:11,037
As someday I shall write it.

9
00:02:11,614 --> 00:02:14,481
No, Zola. It's hopeless.

10
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:18,917
You know that people don't want
to see the stark face of truth.

11
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,927
They would much prefer
perfumed lights like these.

12
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:28,957
They ought to be burned
like something unclean.

13
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:31,692
Why, Paul, that's splendid.

14
00:02:31,868 --> 00:02:35,133
Why didn't you think of that before?
We shall have a fire!

15
00:02:35,305 --> 00:02:37,170
- We could sell them and...
- What?

16
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,434
And expose others
to their stinking hypocrisies?

17
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:43,170
No, my friend. We'll burn them...

18
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:48,079
...and let their lying pages
warm the bones of men of truth!

19
00:02:48,918 --> 00:02:51,386
There we are.

20
00:02:53,857 --> 00:02:58,760
Well, look at that. Even the old stove
rebels at the vile trash.

21
00:03:06,169 --> 00:03:07,397
Close that window!

22
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:10,095
- You want me to catch cold?
- But we'll suffocate.

23
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,673
That'll be better than perishing
from a draft.

24
00:03:12,842 --> 00:03:15,538
Oh, you and your drafts.

25
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,980
It's the concierge...

26
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:24,278
...for the rent.
- He'll kick us into the street.

27
00:03:25,054 --> 00:03:27,716
Don't let him in. Tell him I'm in bed.

28
00:03:27,891 --> 00:03:30,826
Some horrible disease.
It's catching. Anything.

29
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:40,961
- Who is it?
- It's Émile's mother.

30
00:03:42,639 --> 00:03:46,439
- Come in, Madame Zola.
- Thanks, Paul.

31
00:03:46,609 --> 00:03:50,477
Émile, why are you in bed?
Are you ill?

32
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:54,845
It's tearing my heart out to see you
living like this, and now it must end.

33
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:58,078
Nonsense, <i>Maman</i>. I'm an
independent gentleman of letters...

34
00:03:58,254 --> 00:04:01,121
...and soon the world will recognize me.

35
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,849
Cézanne?

36
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:07,987
- Alexandrine, come in.
- Alexandrine, here? Where?

37
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:11,861
Alexandrine! Darling.

38
00:04:14,337 --> 00:04:17,568
Oh, darling, we have
wonderful news for you.

39
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:20,004
- You have a job.
- You have a job.

40
00:04:20,743 --> 00:04:22,734
A job?

41
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:28,884
I have a job?
Cézanne! Did you hear? I have a job!

42
00:04:33,923 --> 00:04:36,289
What kind of job?

43
00:04:36,459 --> 00:04:39,360
I'm not going to sell my talents
to any lying...

44
00:04:39,529 --> 00:04:42,464
This is a job with La Rue,
the great book publisher.

45
00:04:42,632 --> 00:04:48,036
You're to be a clerk. Oh, darling,
we can get married now.

46
00:04:48,204 --> 00:04:50,229
That's marvelous!

47
00:04:50,406 --> 00:04:52,636
Now I shall have time to finish my book.

48
00:04:52,809 --> 00:04:55,539
Maybe even get La Rue to publish it.

49
00:04:56,679 --> 00:04:58,306
Cézanne, take <i>Maman</i>'s coat.

50
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,710
Paul, get meat and bread!

51
00:05:24,173 --> 00:05:27,040
- What is it?
- Émile, I hate to trouble you like this...

52
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,906
...but the butcher refuses us
any more credit.

53
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:33,537
- You told him we'd settle at month's end.
- But he wants it now.

54
00:05:33,716 --> 00:05:37,379
And the landlord was very nasty
about the rent again this morning.

55
00:05:37,553 --> 00:05:41,819
- Couldn't you ask for another advance?
- I've already had two advances this month.

56
00:05:41,991 --> 00:05:45,256
- You're wanted in the office right away.
- Yes.

57
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:48,886
I'll do whatever I can.
Don't worry, dear.

58
00:05:56,005 --> 00:05:58,769
This is the agent of police.
He has something to say.

59
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:01,637
Do you have a book called
<i>The Confessions of Claude</i>?

60
00:06:02,011 --> 00:06:06,141
- Yes.
- The public prosecutor is highly displeased.

61
00:06:06,315 --> 00:06:08,442
- Why?
- It is a bad book.

62
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:10,848
- Badly written?
- It is an offensive book.

63
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:14,114
- It will do great harm to public morals.
- Keep quiet.

64
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:16,918
We've been watching your writings,
young man.

65
00:06:17,093 --> 00:06:21,154
You're a troublemaker. Your articles,
attacking our leading men of letters...

66
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:24,697
...the arts, criticizing the civic authorities.

67
00:06:25,268 --> 00:06:28,032
Perhaps there's something
better for me to criticize?

68
00:06:28,204 --> 00:06:31,537
I don't want any of your impudence.
You've got to stop it.

69
00:06:31,707 --> 00:06:34,039
This is an official warning.

70
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:39,103
- I hope I won't have to come here again.
- You realize, monsieur...

71
00:06:39,282 --> 00:06:41,443
...that his book was not published by me.

72
00:06:41,617 --> 00:06:46,179
But it was written by your employee.
That makes you responsible under the law.

73
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:51,592
- Well.
- I didn't mean to get you into trouble.

74
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:56,391
Why do you write such muckraking stuff
when there are many pleasant things in life?

75
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:58,056
And many unpleasant things.

76
00:06:58,234 --> 00:07:02,068
That's not your business while you work
for me. I should discharge you...

77
00:07:02,238 --> 00:07:04,832
...but I'll give you one more chance.
- Thank you.

78
00:07:05,007 --> 00:07:10,104
But from now on, you will tend strictly
to your work and stop writing trash.

79
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:17,775
- What? Is that a bad exchange for a job?
- A very bad exchange, Monsieur La Rue.

80
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:24,015
Here is your pay
up to the end of the month.

81
00:07:25,128 --> 00:07:26,720
Get out.

82
00:07:28,498 --> 00:07:30,728
- I'm very grateful to you.
- What?

83
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:33,596
For allowing me to devote
all my time to my writing.

84
00:07:33,769 --> 00:07:35,634
Then go ahead with your scribbling.

85
00:07:35,805 --> 00:07:38,365
And maybe a lean stomach
will teach you better!

86
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:41,374
But a fat stomach sticks out too far,
Monsieur La Rue.

87
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:44,638
It prevents you from seeing
what's going on around you.

88
00:07:44,814 --> 00:07:49,217
While you grow fatter and richer
publishing your nauseating confectionary...

89
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:52,320
...I shall become a mole,
digging here, rooting there.

90
00:07:52,488 --> 00:07:56,686
Stirring up the whole rotten mess
where life is hard, raw and ugly.

91
00:07:56,859 --> 00:08:01,228
You will not like the smell of my books.
Neither will the public prosecutor.

92
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:05,390
But when the stench is strong enough,
maybe something will be done about it.

93
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:07,297
Good day!

94
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:24,481
You there! Hold on!

95
00:08:24,654 --> 00:08:27,748
- Hold on!
- Stop yelling and let us sleep.

96
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:29,789
A woman just jumped into the river.

97
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:33,690
She's better off than all of these.

98
00:09:07,563 --> 00:09:10,794
- Why weren't the safety doors closed?
- Safety doors?

99
00:09:10,967 --> 00:09:14,994
- They don't waste money on safety doors.
- Hey, you!

100
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:18,706
Get away from here and stay away.

101
00:09:22,378 --> 00:09:25,870
It is true. All these things are true.
I saw them with my own eyes.

102
00:09:26,048 --> 00:09:29,108
Print this about the uproar
in the Chamber of Deputies.

103
00:09:29,285 --> 00:09:33,244
The military clique howling Clemenceau
down because he told them that...

104
00:09:33,422 --> 00:09:37,825
...the army was honeycombed with graft and
warned them not to provoke the Prussians.

105
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:40,792
I should bother.
They're only space-fillers at best.

106
00:09:40,963 --> 00:09:44,057
I'll give you 10 franc for the lot.
Take it or leave it.

107
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:47,396
- But, monsieur, l...
- Ten franc.

108
00:09:48,971 --> 00:09:52,168
Cecile! Antoinette! The police!

109
00:10:04,887 --> 00:10:08,345
- Come on, get in there!
- Come on, get in here!

110
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,040
Out, out, out.

111
00:10:31,414 --> 00:10:33,075
Quick.

112
00:10:33,382 --> 00:10:35,111
Sit here.

113
00:10:37,353 --> 00:10:38,581
- The...
- Come along, you.

114
00:10:38,754 --> 00:10:42,087
Sit still. This lady's with us.

115
00:10:42,258 --> 00:10:45,625
- Leave her alone.
- Then what is her name?

116
00:10:45,795 --> 00:10:49,356
I tell you, the lady is our friend.
You have no right.

117
00:10:49,532 --> 00:10:53,969
You are very clever, all of you,
but we'll meet again.

118
00:10:59,108 --> 00:11:00,632
Have something with us.

119
00:11:00,810 --> 00:11:03,370
- Me?
- Yes.

120
00:11:03,546 --> 00:11:05,343
Cognac.

121
00:11:05,514 --> 00:11:09,245
Are your eyes on sticks, then,
that they pop out so far?

122
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:15,057
Tell me, what is your name?

123
00:11:15,224 --> 00:11:18,853
Satin in this district,
Lucille in Montmartre...

124
00:11:19,028 --> 00:11:22,555
...and in Montparnasse,
I'm Georgette or Madeleine.

125
00:11:22,732 --> 00:11:24,825
Does it matter?

126
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,968
Why do you ask? What do you want?
I have nothing.

127
00:11:28,137 --> 00:11:29,934
We have something in common, then.

128
00:11:30,106 --> 00:11:32,301
- What?
- Nothing.

129
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:37,273
But your accent isn't Parisian.

130
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:40,904
- Where are you from?
- From Artois.

131
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,812
Hedin.

132
00:11:43,419 --> 00:11:48,914
- And I wish I was back there.
- Well, perhaps someday you can go home.

133
00:11:49,091 --> 00:11:52,219
Me? Go home?

134
00:11:53,062 --> 00:11:54,859
Look at me.

135
00:11:55,364 --> 00:11:57,525
I can never go home.

136
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:00,100
And I hate Paris.

137
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:04,200
Cold and wet. Hunted like an animal.

138
00:12:04,373 --> 00:12:10,869
Starved. Beaten by the police.
It's dirty, beastly. I hate it!

139
00:12:19,588 --> 00:12:23,752
- Well?
- When did you first come to Paris?

140
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,054
A hundred years ago, when I was 17.

141
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,659
You should've seen me then.
I was lovely.

142
00:12:36,071 --> 00:12:39,404
Of course, I'm not bad now...

143
00:12:39,575 --> 00:12:42,840
...if you look quick
and there's not too much light.

144
00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:45,037
You're charming.

145
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:52,448
I was lovely then, really lovely.

146
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:59,259
- I wish I could tell you about it.
- Why don't you?

147
00:13:00,996 --> 00:13:02,930
So you see...

148
00:13:03,265 --> 00:13:05,995
...he was not to blame either.

149
00:13:06,502 --> 00:13:09,699
There was just nothing else for me to do.

150
00:13:15,077 --> 00:13:16,942
Mademoiselle?

151
00:13:17,513 --> 00:13:19,845
Mademoiselle Nana?

152
00:13:22,384 --> 00:13:26,377
- How did you know my name?
- Why, it's written here.

153
00:13:26,555 --> 00:13:28,955
- What do you want, then?
- Why didn't he...?

154
00:13:29,124 --> 00:13:34,824
Oh, don't ask me any more questions.
Take all this stuff. All!

155
00:13:36,265 --> 00:13:39,723
All but this.

156
00:13:43,939 --> 00:13:50,435
- The child, what happened to her?
- She died.

157
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,778
Convent Saint Marie...

158
00:13:54,383 --> 00:13:57,284
...if it's any of your business.

159
00:14:11,033 --> 00:14:12,796
Émile.

160
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,937
Émile.

161
00:14:24,213 --> 00:14:28,172
Paul, where's that sketch
you made of her?

162
00:14:32,555 --> 00:14:36,355
That's magnificent. And a pencil.

163
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,966
That's what I'll call my book.

164
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:07,114
- Have you everything you want, my dear?
- Yes.

165
00:15:09,491 --> 00:15:12,085
Oh, I forgot. I want a copy of <i>Nana</i>.

166
00:15:12,261 --> 00:15:15,594
One doesn't read such books.
It's not proper.

167
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:21,665
Madame.

168
00:15:22,738 --> 00:15:24,706
Madame, your umbrella.

169
00:15:24,873 --> 00:15:27,671
Thank you. And send me
a copy of <i>Nana</i> to my address.

170
00:15:27,843 --> 00:15:30,334
I certainly will.

171
00:15:37,486 --> 00:15:39,886
How about a nice new umbrella,
monsieur?

172
00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:42,421
I can sell you a beauty for 2 franc, 50.

173
00:15:42,591 --> 00:15:45,424
And lose the privilege
of arguing with my old friend?

174
00:15:45,594 --> 00:15:47,585
No, thank you.

175
00:15:47,997 --> 00:15:50,124
Umbrella! Umbrella!

176
00:16:02,444 --> 00:16:06,210
- Is Monsieur Charpentier in?
- Yes. Jean?

177
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,850
- Yes?
- Monsieur Zola is here.

178
00:16:11,453 --> 00:16:13,819
- Zola.
- Monsieur Charpentier, l...

179
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:18,653
I... Well, I have a favor to ask.

180
00:16:18,827 --> 00:16:22,820
Monsieur Zola has a favor to ask.
And what is this favor, Monsieur Zola?

181
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:25,458
It's quite unusual...

182
00:16:25,634 --> 00:16:29,900
...but could you advance me a few franc
on <i>Nana</i>? I'm sure it will sell, monsieur.

183
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:35,066
Monsieur Zola wishes the advance of a few
franc because he is sure <i>Nana</i> will sell.

184
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:37,337
Isn't that magnificent?

185
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:40,641
You write a book about the gutter,
you call it <i>Nana</i>...

186
00:16:40,816 --> 00:16:43,376
...and you hope to make a little money.

187
00:16:43,552 --> 00:16:45,782
Come with me.

188
00:16:50,626 --> 00:16:53,993
I have just finished stamping
and addressing it to you.

189
00:16:54,396 --> 00:16:57,092
Well, open it and read.

190
00:17:05,574 --> 00:17:10,034
"<i>Nana</i> sells 36,000...

191
00:17:10,212 --> 00:17:12,703
...the first three days..."?

192
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:18,083
"Enclosed find check..."

193
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:26,424
For 18,000 francs?

194
00:17:32,901 --> 00:17:36,667
Yes, well...
Why, I can't believe it. It's...

195
00:17:37,106 --> 00:17:38,835
Thank you.

196
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:43,777
Thank you very much. I don't know how
to thank you. <i>Adieu</i>. Goodbye.

197
00:17:43,946 --> 00:17:46,574
Goodbye, monsieur.
Goodbye, madame.

198
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:50,446
- Monsieur?
- Yes, what is it?

199
00:17:51,253 --> 00:17:56,452
Could you...? Could you still
let me have a few franc? In cash.

200
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,855
I'll pay you back tomorrow.

201
00:18:05,434 --> 00:18:08,801
Thank you, monsieur.
Thank you very much.

202
00:18:09,872 --> 00:18:12,966
Thank you, madame. Thank you.

203
00:18:17,246 --> 00:18:20,773
- Umbrella!
- Yes, of course. I'll have a dozen.

204
00:18:20,949 --> 00:18:23,975
I'll have two doz...
No, I'll have one. Here.

205
00:18:24,153 --> 00:18:26,451
- There you are.
- Umbrella!

206
00:18:26,622 --> 00:18:29,557
New umbrella! Umbrella!

207
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:51,198
- Where are they going?
- To Berlin.

208
00:19:51,373 --> 00:19:54,433
- Berlin?
- Haven't you heard? War's been declared.

209
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,101
Isn't it glorious?

210
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:15,860
Those dreadful Prussians,
at the very gates of Paris.

211
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:18,761
There, there, <i>Maman</i>. Don't take on so.

212
00:20:18,934 --> 00:20:23,667
We'll all be murdered in our beds.
It's disgraceful.

213
00:20:23,839 --> 00:20:28,208
There's not a morsel of food
to be bought anywhere in the whole town.

214
00:20:28,377 --> 00:20:31,141
Even the horseflesh has been sold out.

215
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:36,114
And the streets...
It's frightening, terrifying.

216
00:20:36,285 --> 00:20:38,549
Never did I think I'd live to see France...

217
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,451
...groveling in the dust
under the Prussian heel.

218
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:46,461
- How will it end, Émile?
- How does it always end?

219
00:20:46,628 --> 00:20:49,825
In misery, suffering,
in the blood of the people.

220
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:54,230
Those generals plunged us recklessly
into a war for which we were unprepared.

221
00:20:54,403 --> 00:20:57,099
Is it any wonder that we were
disastrously defeated?

222
00:20:57,272 --> 00:21:01,333
- Those are the fortunes of war.
- Those are indeed the fortunes of war.

223
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:05,071
The whole structure had to collapse
before we could learn the truth.

224
00:21:05,247 --> 00:21:09,274
But France shall know why.
I shall name her betrayers.

225
00:21:09,451 --> 00:21:12,045
She shall see who led her men
to the slaughter...

226
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:15,246
...who's responsible for her downfall.

227
00:21:16,992 --> 00:21:19,426
"During the entire war of 1870...

228
00:21:19,594 --> 00:21:22,893
...the execution of the campaign
was lame, impotent...

229
00:21:23,065 --> 00:21:26,091
...and nullified by petty jealousies
among the generals...

230
00:21:26,268 --> 00:21:31,763
...each of whom thought only of securing
a field marshal's baton for himself.

231
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:36,401
The army was governed by
dry rot and slow paralysis.

232
00:21:36,745 --> 00:21:41,444
The general staff was mediocre,
of an ignorance past belief...

233
00:21:41,616 --> 00:21:44,710
...rushing into the adventure
of war with the confusion...

234
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,855
...of a flock of sheep
being led to the shambles."

235
00:21:48,023 --> 00:21:50,184
- Good morning.
- Good morning, sir.

236
00:21:55,063 --> 00:21:57,554
What is it? You seem disturbed.

237
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:01,567
Have you read the attack on the general
staff in this book, <i>The Downfall</i>?

238
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:05,104
Book? Book? I never read books.
Who's it by?

239
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,439
A certain Émile Zola.

240
00:22:08,777 --> 00:22:11,803
A civilian daring to criticize the army.

241
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:15,108
He wasn't exactly criticizing, sir.
I've read the book.

242
00:22:15,283 --> 00:22:19,049
The war has been over for many years,
but I've gathered, as Zola says...

243
00:22:19,221 --> 00:22:23,089
...there were times in that campaign
when our staffwork wasn't brilliant.

244
00:22:23,258 --> 00:22:26,750
- What?
- We should admit our mistakes.

245
00:22:27,329 --> 00:22:30,992
The army does not
make mistakes, Picquart...

246
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:35,262
...and it will not tolerate
civilian criticism.

247
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:41,034
I suggest that you see
the chief censor about this book.

248
00:22:41,209 --> 00:22:44,372
Tell him the army demands
the punishment of this upstart.

249
00:22:48,717 --> 00:22:51,049
Chief censor, over there.

250
00:22:55,424 --> 00:22:57,289
- Monsieur.
- Mr. Zola...

251
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:01,190
...I sent for you because every book
you've written has caused trouble.

252
00:23:01,363 --> 00:23:05,663
You attacked the Second Empire.
You attacked the Third Republic.

253
00:23:05,867 --> 00:23:10,964
<i>Germinal</i> caused a furor and unrest
among the miners that lasted for years.

254
00:23:11,573 --> 00:23:15,065
- <i>Nana</i>: Brutal, disgusting.
- But true.

255
00:23:15,243 --> 00:23:18,838
All of them stirring France
to restlessness, angry passion.

256
00:23:19,614 --> 00:23:22,913
And now this <i>Downfall</i>,
attacking our army.

257
00:23:23,085 --> 00:23:24,518
The army heads are furious.

258
00:23:25,187 --> 00:23:28,520
Such a book makes the whole country
lose confidence and respect.

259
00:23:28,690 --> 00:23:31,318
Lose confidence in inefficiency?

260
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:34,553
Lose respect for cowardice and stupidity?

261
00:23:34,729 --> 00:23:38,529
- That would be a pity, monsieur.
- You'll write no more such books.

262
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:43,694
Except, perhaps, one about the rascality
of army-ridden politicians.

263
00:23:43,872 --> 00:23:47,740
That's an idea.
To expose the government itself...

264
00:23:47,909 --> 00:23:51,140
...with as much truth and accuracy
as I put into <i>The Downfall</i>.

265
00:23:51,313 --> 00:23:54,043
- A book that would show...
- No, no. I mean...

266
00:23:54,216 --> 00:23:56,776
...you're a reasonable man,
Monsieur Zola.

267
00:23:56,952 --> 00:24:00,388
We only want to do
what we think is best for our country.

268
00:24:00,555 --> 00:24:02,716
You will do what is best for yourself...

269
00:24:02,891 --> 00:24:08,523
...by leaving me strictly alone
to write what I please, as I please.

270
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,761
Good day, monsieur.

271
00:24:59,681 --> 00:25:02,172
That's the funniest thing I've...

272
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:10,315
It's good to be together again, Paul.
Just like old times.

273
00:25:10,659 --> 00:25:13,150
Old times.

274
00:25:14,863 --> 00:25:19,800
Oh, Paul, I want you to see the pearls
Émile bought for me when we were in Italy.

275
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:23,230
- Albert.
- Yes, monsieur?

276
00:25:23,405 --> 00:25:26,431
Make certain that all the windows
are tightly shut.

277
00:25:30,979 --> 00:25:35,143
- Émile, Émile. Still afraid of drafts.
- My chest, you know.

278
00:25:35,317 --> 00:25:38,844
Oh, your chest is as strong as a barrel.
It always was.

279
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:42,456
Paul, I've always... You know, l...
I want to show you something.

280
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:45,218
Look at this priceless bit of woodcarving.

281
00:25:45,393 --> 00:25:48,954
I picked it up at Lodi,
an extraordinary piece of craftsmanship.

282
00:25:49,130 --> 00:25:53,499
And... Oh, now I have a real
rare treat for you.

283
00:25:53,668 --> 00:25:57,468
I have something here that
you may have traveled the world over...

284
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:02,542
...and never have found its like.
This will simply leave you breathless.

285
00:26:02,844 --> 00:26:05,540
This most exquisite majolica.

286
00:26:05,714 --> 00:26:08,979
I chanced upon it in a little,
out-of-the-way shop in Venice.

287
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:11,243
The work on this...

288
00:26:14,623 --> 00:26:19,720
- Won't you sit down, Paul?
- No, I must go.

289
00:26:19,894 --> 00:26:22,385
- It's goodbye.
- Goodbye?

290
00:26:22,564 --> 00:26:28,161
Yes. I'm going south,
back to the country.

291
00:26:29,037 --> 00:26:32,438
You can't do that, man.
Why, Paris is the very center...

292
00:26:32,607 --> 00:26:34,871
Paris isn't for me any longer.

293
00:26:35,910 --> 00:26:37,878
Come, Paul.

294
00:26:38,947 --> 00:26:41,279
We're old friends.

295
00:26:41,449 --> 00:26:43,940
Out with it. What is it?

296
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:47,282
- You really want me to tell you?
- Why, of course.

297
00:26:47,989 --> 00:26:51,117
You're wealthy now, world-famous...

298
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:54,923
...a member of the Legion of Honor.

299
00:26:56,531 --> 00:27:00,900
You've come a long way from the days
when we starved together in an attic.

300
00:27:02,003 --> 00:27:03,470
And you shouted:

301
00:27:03,638 --> 00:27:07,074
"Burn the books of the hypocrites,
the shams...

302
00:27:07,242 --> 00:27:11,906
...and let their lying pages
warm the bones of a man of truth."

303
00:27:14,249 --> 00:27:19,016
Sometimes I'm tempted to give in
and paint for...

304
00:27:20,488 --> 00:27:22,513
No, Émile.

305
00:27:23,024 --> 00:27:26,460
An artist should remain poor.

306
00:27:27,195 --> 00:27:33,691
Otherwise his talent, like his stomach,
grows fat and stuffy.

307
00:27:35,637 --> 00:27:42,133
I am sorry, Émile, but I had to say it.
You're my oldest and my dearest friend.

308
00:27:43,044 --> 00:27:47,640
- I couldn't go without telling you this.
- Paul.

309
00:27:49,250 --> 00:27:51,218
Won't you stay?

310
00:27:53,888 --> 00:27:59,019
I need someone to remind me
of the old, struggling, carefree days...

311
00:27:59,828 --> 00:28:02,194
...fighting for a foothold.

312
00:28:02,364 --> 00:28:07,392
You can never go back to it,
and I've never left it.

313
00:28:08,903 --> 00:28:10,700
Paul.

314
00:28:11,506 --> 00:28:14,703
- Will you write?
- No.

315
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:19,580
But I'll remember.

316
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:57,741
- What's the matter, dear? Tired?
- No, no. Just thinking.

317
00:28:58,453 --> 00:29:00,614
Cézanne's gone.

318
00:29:00,789 --> 00:29:05,590
- Back to Provence.
- Yes, I know. I met him in the hall.

319
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:10,595
- You didn't quarrel?
- Quarrel? With Cézanne?

320
00:29:13,268 --> 00:29:16,260
But he's taken something of me with him.

321
00:29:17,705 --> 00:29:20,606
- The last of my youth.
- Oh, rubbish.

322
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:29,082
He said I was getting too famous
and too fat.

323
00:29:31,786 --> 00:29:34,277
Well, what if I have?

324
00:29:35,223 --> 00:29:41,458
I've fought my battles. I want calm, rest.

325
00:29:43,331 --> 00:29:48,860
- From now on, I could look only backward.
- That's just idle talk.

326
00:29:49,671 --> 00:29:52,640
Come, let's play a game of piquet.

327
00:29:52,807 --> 00:29:55,002
Strange, isn't it?

328
00:29:56,778 --> 00:29:59,110
Paul and I.

329
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,480
Well, life is tricky.

330
00:30:04,652 --> 00:30:08,383
And I suppose we don't influence
our fate.

331
00:30:08,556 --> 00:30:12,185
While we're playing piquet,
a starving mother and child...

332
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,022
...jump into the River Seine.

333
00:30:15,196 --> 00:30:17,994
A servant forgets to extinguish a stove...

334
00:30:18,166 --> 00:30:20,896
...and someone suffocates.

335
00:30:21,302 --> 00:30:24,794
Who knows whose fate
may intermingle with ours.

336
00:30:24,973 --> 00:30:26,668
Or when.

337
00:30:27,175 --> 00:30:29,302
A shot is fired.

338
00:30:29,777 --> 00:30:32,007
A letter is written.

339
00:30:52,700 --> 00:30:57,262
- Rene, lay out my civilian suit at once.
- Very good, commandant.

340
00:31:30,672 --> 00:31:31,900
Monsieur.

341
00:31:32,073 --> 00:31:35,372
I want to see the military attaché,
Colonel von Schwartzkoppen.

342
00:31:35,543 --> 00:31:39,570
Sorry, His Excellency went to Berlin,
but he'll be back tonight.

343
00:31:40,748 --> 00:31:44,013
- I'll leave this letter for him.
- Very good, monsieur.

344
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:37,970
- What is it?
- Look.

345
00:32:38,673 --> 00:32:43,235
- Colonel von Schwartzkoppen?
- The German military attaché. Interesting.

346
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,081
- The commandant should see this.
- Now, wait a minute.

347
00:32:50,818 --> 00:32:52,877
What do you think of this?

348
00:33:01,029 --> 00:33:03,122
Outrageous.

349
00:33:03,531 --> 00:33:06,398
This should be examined
by the chief of intelligence.

350
00:33:09,404 --> 00:33:11,497
Excuse me, colonel.

351
00:33:16,678 --> 00:33:18,077
This is inconceivable.

352
00:33:18,379 --> 00:33:21,871
We must show it to the war minister.
Gentlemen, come with me.

353
00:33:23,851 --> 00:33:26,547
I think that will be all, gentlemen.

354
00:33:29,157 --> 00:33:30,852
- Pardon me, general.
- Yes?

355
00:33:31,025 --> 00:33:33,186
This is most urgent.

356
00:33:36,631 --> 00:33:38,496
- It's a <i>bordereau</i>.
- Yes.

357
00:33:38,666 --> 00:33:41,066
A list of our secret documents.

358
00:33:41,703 --> 00:33:43,864
"I am sending you..." What's this?

359
00:33:44,038 --> 00:33:49,772
"Notes on the 120 mm gun,
new plan on covering troops...

360
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:53,971
...changes in artillery formation,
Madagascar expedition...

361
00:33:54,282 --> 00:34:00,346
...a new shooting manual for field artillery,
very difficult to procure.

362
00:34:00,621 --> 00:34:03,454
I am about to leave for the..."

363
00:34:05,026 --> 00:34:07,927
This accounts for the leakage
in army information.

364
00:34:08,162 --> 00:34:10,824
- How did we get it?
- The usual channels, sir.

365
00:34:10,998 --> 00:34:13,660
Our agent procured it
at the German embassy.

366
00:34:14,268 --> 00:34:19,069
Well, gentlemen, the man who wrote this
is our traitor.

367
00:34:19,707 --> 00:34:21,197
Now...

368
00:34:21,375 --> 00:34:24,572
...who is it?
- He must be on the general staff, sir.

369
00:34:24,979 --> 00:34:26,412
- One of us?
- Absurd.

370
00:34:26,581 --> 00:34:27,946
Impossible.

371
00:34:28,349 --> 00:34:33,116
Well, let's have a look at this roster
of staff officers.

372
00:34:38,860 --> 00:34:40,691
"Record of officers...

373
00:34:40,862 --> 00:34:44,457
Aaron D'Aboville." It's not you, I suppose,
D'Aboville, is it?

374
00:34:44,632 --> 00:34:46,600
- I'll swear it's not, sir.
- Marvelous.

375
00:34:46,768 --> 00:34:49,862
- It's like a confounded novel.
- "Aaron Cedibini."

376
00:34:50,037 --> 00:34:51,698
No, no, no.

377
00:34:51,939 --> 00:34:53,736
"Dreyfus."

378
00:34:54,809 --> 00:34:58,973
- You found something, colonel?
- I was just wondering about Esterhazy.

379
00:34:59,147 --> 00:35:02,446
Ferdinand, Count Walsin-Esterhazy.
He's a foreigner.

380
00:35:02,617 --> 00:35:03,982
- A foreigner?
- Yes.

381
00:35:04,152 --> 00:35:05,517
He's of Hungarian descent.

382
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:08,177
But his father was a general
in the French army.

383
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:12,793
Besides, Esterhazy's an infantry officer.
The man who wrote that is a gunner.

384
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,552
Gunner.

385
00:35:15,129 --> 00:35:18,257
How about this fellow here?
"Dreyfus, Alfred."

386
00:35:18,432 --> 00:35:22,095
I wonder how he ever became
a member of the general staff.

387
00:35:22,270 --> 00:35:23,601
That's our man.

388
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:25,998
Sandherr, take action on it at once.

389
00:35:26,174 --> 00:35:27,402
Very good, sir.

390
00:35:27,575 --> 00:35:31,944
Commandant, send a message to Dreyfus
to report here first thing Monday morning.

391
00:35:32,113 --> 00:35:33,774
Yes, general.

392
00:35:40,922 --> 00:35:44,289
- Papa, the enemy advances.
- All right, fire.

393
00:35:45,159 --> 00:35:48,185
- Don't forget, <i>Maman</i>, when the guns fire...
- I won't, dear.

394
00:35:48,362 --> 00:35:51,854
- Wait, I'm not ready.
- Hurry, or your battalions will be repulsed.

395
00:35:52,033 --> 00:35:54,968
Oh, not the French battalions, Papa.

396
00:35:55,236 --> 00:35:56,965
All right. Here it goes.

397
00:36:02,009 --> 00:36:03,601
Come in.

398
00:36:04,145 --> 00:36:07,512
- A messenger from the war ministry.
- Show him in.

399
00:36:09,050 --> 00:36:10,278
- Captain Dreyfus.
- Yes.

400
00:36:10,451 --> 00:36:13,318
- A message for you, urgent.
- Thank you.

401
00:36:23,531 --> 00:36:26,694
- What is it, dear?
- "Captain Dreyfus will present himself...

402
00:36:26,868 --> 00:36:30,804
...tomorrow morning, 9:00,
at the office of the chief of general staff.

403
00:36:30,972 --> 00:36:32,872
Civilian dress."

404
00:36:33,174 --> 00:36:35,142
Civilian dress?

405
00:36:35,676 --> 00:36:37,906
You know,
one of those general inspections.

406
00:36:38,112 --> 00:36:39,943
But at that hour.

407
00:36:40,114 --> 00:36:41,979
Isn't that strange?

408
00:36:43,718 --> 00:36:46,380
Always worried.

409
00:36:57,131 --> 00:37:00,794
- Captain Dreyfus reporting, commandant.
- Yes.

410
00:37:01,035 --> 00:37:02,900
Just a moment.

411
00:37:08,242 --> 00:37:11,609
Oh, no, no, gentlemen.
Experience has proved...

412
00:37:11,779 --> 00:37:14,805
...that the 120 mm gun is...

413
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:17,212
Captain Dreyfus is waiting, sir.

414
00:37:17,718 --> 00:37:19,982
- Seem upset?
- No, sir.

415
00:37:20,154 --> 00:37:23,021
Evidently more of a scoundrel
than we thought.

416
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:26,318
Inform Commandant Dort.
He knows what to do.

417
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:28,359
- Yes, sir.
- Well, as I was saying...

418
00:37:28,529 --> 00:37:31,965
...the 120 mm gun
is the most serviceable...

419
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:34,363
- Captain Dreyfus is here.
- Oh, very good.

420
00:37:34,535 --> 00:37:36,526
Hurry, Brucker. Hurry.

421
00:37:40,141 --> 00:37:44,544
- Henry.
- Coming. Excuse me.

422
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:48,908
- See you tonight, my friend.
- As usual.

423
00:37:55,589 --> 00:37:57,819
Go to office number five.

424
00:38:10,271 --> 00:38:11,863
He's coming.

425
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:51,606
- Captain Dreyfus.
- Yes, commandant.

426
00:38:52,313 --> 00:38:56,272
- I'm to report to the chief of staff.
- Who is busy just now.

427
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:58,941
- Did you hurt your hand?
- Yes.

428
00:38:59,120 --> 00:39:02,351
I have an important memo to write
for the chief of staff.

429
00:39:02,523 --> 00:39:04,491
Would you mind, while you're waiting?

430
00:39:04,658 --> 00:39:07,718
- Not at all. Gladly, sir.
- I'll dictate it.

431
00:39:11,032 --> 00:39:12,397
Paris...

432
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:16,295
...the 15th of October, 1894.

433
00:39:16,670 --> 00:39:19,434
- 1894.
- Monsieur...

434
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:22,641
- Monsieur.
...it is important that I regain...

435
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,835
...immediate possession...

436
00:39:25,546 --> 00:39:27,377
...of the documents...

437
00:39:28,049 --> 00:39:31,678
- Have you got that?
- Of the documents.

438
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:34,144
Which I gave you...

439
00:39:35,356 --> 00:39:37,586
...before going on maneuvers.

440
00:39:39,894 --> 00:39:41,919
What was that last word?

441
00:39:42,963 --> 00:39:44,726
"Maneuvers," sir.

442
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,560
Consisting of a note...

443
00:39:52,273 --> 00:39:55,902
Well, what's the matter, Dreyfus?
Your hands are trembling.

444
00:39:56,977 --> 00:39:59,502
No, sir. My fingers are cold.
It isn't summer...

445
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,739
Keep your jokes to yourself.

446
00:40:01,916 --> 00:40:03,884
This matter is serious.

447
00:40:04,351 --> 00:40:08,651
- I don't understand, commandant. I only...
- Repeat the last word.

448
00:40:10,858 --> 00:40:12,257
"Note."

449
00:40:13,427 --> 00:40:15,156
A note...

450
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:18,228
...on the hydraulic brake...

451
00:40:18,632 --> 00:40:23,660
...of the 120 mm gun.
- Gun.

452
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,238
In the name of the law,
you're under arrest.

453
00:40:30,211 --> 00:40:32,236
Arrest?

454
00:40:33,047 --> 00:40:35,413
- On what charge?
- Treason.

455
00:40:36,317 --> 00:40:39,753
But... But... This is outrageous!

456
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:43,879
I've devoted my entire life to the army
and you dare to...

457
00:40:44,058 --> 00:40:46,288
Why, this is an insult!

458
00:40:47,628 --> 00:40:49,220
Satisfied?

459
00:40:49,396 --> 00:40:52,524
Perhaps you'll tell me the basis
of this charge against me.

460
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:55,100
Obstinate, aren't you,
pretending you don't know?

461
00:40:55,269 --> 00:40:58,261
All I know is that I'm innocent.

462
00:40:58,439 --> 00:41:00,964
Your handwriting speaks against you.

463
00:41:13,521 --> 00:41:17,457
I've been instructed to offer you
the usual alternative.

464
00:41:23,931 --> 00:41:25,159
No.

465
00:41:25,332 --> 00:41:31,066
I'm not so obliging, nor so stupid
as to provide you with a perfect case.

466
00:41:31,272 --> 00:41:34,070
I shall live to prove my innocence.

467
00:41:35,209 --> 00:41:36,904
Take him away.

468
00:41:41,649 --> 00:41:45,983
Jeanne, get Papa's slippers
and house jacket!

469
00:41:46,687 --> 00:41:48,951
I've got them.

470
00:41:53,961 --> 00:41:57,294
- There he is.
- Papa! Papa!

471
00:42:06,173 --> 00:42:07,538
- Madame Dreyfus?
- Yes?

472
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:11,405
I am Commandant Dort,
intelligence section of the general staff.

473
00:42:11,912 --> 00:42:13,277
Go to your room, darlings.

474
00:42:13,447 --> 00:42:15,813
- Yes, <i>Maman</i>.
- Yes, <i>Maman</i>.

475
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:23,647
- Yes, commandant?
- I have orders to search this house.

476
00:42:26,327 --> 00:42:28,420
I don't understand.

477
00:42:28,662 --> 00:42:31,062
- My husband...
- Your husband is under arrest...

478
00:42:31,232 --> 00:42:34,895
...in the Cherche-Midi prison.
- Why, you must be mad.

479
00:42:35,236 --> 00:42:39,639
- My husband left here this morning...
- And is now in prison, charged with treason.

480
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,301
Now I know you're mistaken.

481
00:42:42,509 --> 00:42:46,605
My husband has given 20 years
of his life to his country's service.

482
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:49,749
A traitor? Why, how dare you.

483
00:42:49,950 --> 00:42:52,350
- I'll call...
- You will call no one, madame.

484
00:42:52,519 --> 00:42:56,046
You will serve your husband best
by being quiet and saying nothing.

485
00:42:56,223 --> 00:42:58,487
If you don't, things will go badly for him.

486
00:42:58,659 --> 00:43:00,627
Search the house.

487
00:43:03,897 --> 00:43:05,660
Brucker.

488
00:43:13,474 --> 00:43:16,875
- You'll find nothing.
- Your husband is very clever, madame.

489
00:43:17,044 --> 00:43:19,137
My husband is innocent, monsieur.

490
00:43:20,414 --> 00:43:22,905
Dreyfus found guilty!

491
00:43:24,485 --> 00:43:27,682
Dreyfus found guilty!

492
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:30,915
- Dreyfus found guilty!
- What a fuss.

493
00:43:31,091 --> 00:43:34,458
The whole country's in an uproar
over this Dreyfus.

494
00:43:36,563 --> 00:43:38,258
Nice, fresh <i>langoustes</i>.

495
00:43:38,432 --> 00:43:41,731
- Shall we get some?
- Shall we? I should say so.

496
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:53,706
These are not fresh-caught.

497
00:43:53,881 --> 00:43:57,112
They're fish, <i>cher monsieur</i>.
All our goods are fresh.

498
00:43:58,085 --> 00:44:03,182
Have I eaten lobsters for years for nothing?
Observe, my dear. His shell is slick.

499
00:44:03,357 --> 00:44:07,794
He's a <i>grand-père</i>, that one,
and long from the sea.

500
00:44:07,961 --> 00:44:13,160
But here's a nice, juicy young bachelor
whose shell is dry and rough.

501
00:44:13,334 --> 00:44:16,633
He'll leap into your gullet and sing
a chantey as he goes down.

502
00:44:16,804 --> 00:44:19,295
- Am I right?
- Lf every customer was like him...

503
00:44:19,473 --> 00:44:22,135
You'd never sell your old stock.

504
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:28,648
- Émile! Émile!
- Hello!

505
00:44:28,816 --> 00:44:31,216
Charpentier!

506
00:44:31,385 --> 00:44:35,515
Alexandrine, there's Charpentier
and Madame Charpentier.

507
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:38,281
Alexandrine, you know Anatole France,
don't you?

508
00:44:38,459 --> 00:44:41,792
This is Monsieur Scheurer-Kestner,
our last senator from Alsace.

509
00:44:41,962 --> 00:44:45,363
Smell this. Smell this. Smell this.

510
00:44:46,233 --> 00:44:51,102
Beautiful. We're having this bachelor and
his whole family for dinner. Will you come?

511
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:56,038
<i>Kill the traitor, Dreyfus! Kill the traitor,</i>
<i>Dreyfus! Kill the traitor, Dreyfus!</i>

512
00:44:56,276 --> 00:44:59,871
<i>Kill the traitor, Dreyfus!</i>
<i>Kill the traitor, Dreyfus!</i>

513
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:04,342
Suppose Dreyfus is innocent, as he claims.
It would be too dreadful.

514
00:45:04,518 --> 00:45:09,319
Impossible, madame. French justice
today doesn't make mistakes.

515
00:45:20,934 --> 00:45:24,700
Company... arms!

516
00:45:41,054 --> 00:45:43,113
"In the name of the people of France...

517
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:47,021
...Alfred Dreyfus, captain
of the 14th regiment of artillery...

518
00:45:47,194 --> 00:45:51,392
...having been found guilty of treason
by unanimous vote of the court-martial...

519
00:45:51,565 --> 00:45:53,692
...is condemned to deportation for life.

520
00:45:53,867 --> 00:45:57,701
The court-martial orders that prior
to this sentence being carried out...

521
00:45:57,905 --> 00:46:01,397
...Captain Dreyfus shall be paraded
before the garrison of Paris...

522
00:46:01,575 --> 00:46:04,408
...and publicly degraded
and dismissed from service...

523
00:46:04,578 --> 00:46:06,842
...according to the code of military law...

524
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,448
...forfeiting his decorations
and privileges...

525
00:46:09,616 --> 00:46:12,312
...and the right to bear arms forever."

526
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:20,126
In the name of the French people,
we deprive you of your rank.

527
00:46:20,294 --> 00:46:23,525
You are unworthy
of wearing the uniform.

528
00:46:23,797 --> 00:46:25,424
I'm innocent.

529
00:46:25,599 --> 00:46:29,968
By my wife and my children,
I swear I'm innocent.

530
00:46:55,395 --> 00:46:58,296
Long live France! I'm innocent!

531
00:47:14,882 --> 00:47:16,747
Gentlemen of the newspapers!

532
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:20,182
Proclaim to the world that I'm innocent!
I'm innocent!

533
00:47:20,554 --> 00:47:23,182
I'm innocent! I'm innocent!

534
00:47:24,491 --> 00:47:26,459
"I'm innocent. Long live France.

535
00:47:26,627 --> 00:47:30,961
I'm innocent," Dreyfus kept repeating
over and over again while they reviled him.

536
00:47:31,131 --> 00:47:34,828
- All he needed was a crown of thorns.
- Or 30 pieces of silver.

537
00:47:35,002 --> 00:47:39,666
After all, the man was found guilty
of treason. And a traitor's a traitor.

538
00:47:40,207 --> 00:47:42,835
I know, Émile,
but still, he's human, not a dog...

539
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:46,377
...and that crowd,
their faces like rabid beasts.

540
00:47:46,547 --> 00:47:48,310
Yeah, well...

541
00:47:48,482 --> 00:47:51,280
...human and animal skins
are much the same thickness.

542
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:54,909
You can't expect too much. You...

543
00:48:04,031 --> 00:48:07,523
My head, my head.

544
00:48:08,402 --> 00:48:11,701
How it rewards me,
this ungrateful monstrosity...

545
00:48:11,872 --> 00:48:15,603
...that I've combed and fed for 50 years.

546
00:48:18,211 --> 00:48:20,008
You're killing me!

547
00:48:20,681 --> 00:48:21,978
Look.

548
00:48:23,083 --> 00:48:26,211
Look at this picture.
He scarcely has the face of a traitor.

549
00:48:26,386 --> 00:48:29,082
Honest... Dreyfus, Dreyfus!

550
00:48:29,256 --> 00:48:33,158
Must we be eternally plagued
by that name?

551
00:48:37,431 --> 00:48:39,262
You have a visitor.

552
00:48:44,404 --> 00:48:48,170
My glasses. I can't see
without my glasses! Please!

553
00:48:54,247 --> 00:48:56,010
- Lucie.
- Alfred.

554
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,707
Stay back.

555
00:49:04,257 --> 00:49:07,624
- Can't we be alone?
- Orders are orders.

556
00:49:09,563 --> 00:49:11,724
Oh, Alfred, darling...

557
00:49:12,432 --> 00:49:14,696
...what have they done to you?

558
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,893
Never mind, dear.

559
00:49:17,104 --> 00:49:21,438
If only you could give me the slightest
inkling who the real traitor might be.

560
00:49:22,009 --> 00:49:25,945
I don't know. I haven't the faintest idea.

561
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,678
It's all like a nightmare.

562
00:49:28,849 --> 00:49:31,317
- Incredible.
- Be brave.

563
00:49:31,485 --> 00:49:36,354
I'll spare nothing, our future, our lives,
nothing to prove your innocence.

564
00:49:36,523 --> 00:49:38,787
My conscience is clear.

565
00:49:38,959 --> 00:49:43,623
No matter what they do to me,
I'll survive and prove it.

566
00:49:43,797 --> 00:49:45,389
Yes.

567
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:47,032
You must.

568
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:49,899
For the children.

569
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:55,733
How are the little ones?

570
00:49:56,009 --> 00:49:59,274
- You haven't told them?
- No.

571
00:49:59,646 --> 00:50:02,513
I told them that you
were called away by duty.

572
00:50:02,716 --> 00:50:05,082
Duty! Duty!

573
00:50:05,585 --> 00:50:07,576
Oh, Alfred.

574
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:11,656
- Time's up.
- Just one moment more.

575
00:50:11,825 --> 00:50:13,690
- I'm sorry.
- Well, let me go to him.

576
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:16,021
Let me embrace him.
Let me touch him once.

577
00:50:16,196 --> 00:50:18,892
- Let me say goodbye to my husband.
- No.

578
00:50:19,066 --> 00:50:22,194
Are you not married? Have you no wife?

579
00:50:22,369 --> 00:50:24,837
- Time is up.
- You can't separate us. You can't!

580
00:50:25,005 --> 00:50:30,102
- Alfred, darling, don't let them!
- Please, dear, don't make it harder for me.

581
00:50:30,310 --> 00:50:34,576
As long as we have each other
and the children to love...

582
00:50:34,781 --> 00:50:38,114
...perhaps in a little while
we'll all be happy again.

583
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,610
I love you.

584
00:50:42,923 --> 00:50:44,720
I love you.

585
00:50:57,537 --> 00:51:01,473
- Here are your belongings. On your way.
- Where to?

586
00:51:37,778 --> 00:51:41,509
I am innocent! I'm innocent!

587
00:51:41,681 --> 00:51:44,707
I'm innocent! I'm innocent!

588
00:51:44,885 --> 00:51:49,584
I'm... I am innocent!

589
00:51:50,791 --> 00:51:52,281
It is true, sir.

590
00:51:52,459 --> 00:51:55,155
I have never been fully convinced
of Dreyfus' guilt.

591
00:51:55,328 --> 00:51:59,424
Ever since I succeeded Sandherr,
I've tried to find out the truth...

592
00:51:59,666 --> 00:52:02,863
...to find out the real traitor.
And I've got him.

593
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:05,436
- Who is it?
- Count Esterhazy.

594
00:52:05,605 --> 00:52:10,872
- Esterhazy? On what proof?
- I obtained specimens of his handwriting...

595
00:52:11,044 --> 00:52:14,639
...and compared it with the <i>bordereau</i>
on which Dreyfus was convicted.

596
00:52:14,815 --> 00:52:18,307
Both of the writings are Esterhazy's.
Look for yourself.

597
00:52:18,752 --> 00:52:23,246
- Dreyfus was guilty, just the same.
- But I have new evidence, further proof.

598
00:52:23,456 --> 00:52:26,857
My agents got hold of a special
message addressed to Esterhazy...

599
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:31,224
...from the German military attaché.
I tell you, general, Dreyfus is innocent.

600
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:34,196
And I tell you that
you've exceeded your duty.

601
00:52:34,367 --> 00:52:35,959
But, general, this is my duty.

602
00:52:36,136 --> 00:52:38,866
There must not be another
treason trial in the army.

603
00:52:39,039 --> 00:52:41,200
Understand? It must not be.

604
00:52:41,374 --> 00:52:43,934
But what about Dreyfus
rotting on Devil's Island?

605
00:52:44,110 --> 00:52:48,877
Dreyfus, Dreyfus.
Will we never hear the last of the man?

606
00:52:50,717 --> 00:52:54,346
Listen. If it is admitted
that a mistake has been made...

607
00:52:54,521 --> 00:52:57,046
...we, the general staff,
will be at the mercy...

608
00:52:57,224 --> 00:53:01,786
...of every scandal paper in France.
We owe it to the army to prevent that.

609
00:53:02,128 --> 00:53:04,460
But you can't close a tomb
over a living man.

610
00:53:04,831 --> 00:53:08,927
Can't we? If you say nothing,
nobody will ever know.

611
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:11,935
And you will say nothing,
you understand?

612
00:53:12,973 --> 00:53:16,340
- I don't know, sir...
- That is an official order.

613
00:53:16,643 --> 00:53:18,270
You may go.

614
00:53:24,217 --> 00:53:28,153
Can't we find a new post
for our friend Picquart?

615
00:53:28,321 --> 00:53:31,688
It's very quiet here in Paris
for such an energetic fellow.

616
00:53:31,858 --> 00:53:35,157
What about one of our
African desert stations?

617
00:53:35,328 --> 00:53:37,626
It's a bit unhealthy, but...

618
00:53:38,732 --> 00:53:40,996
What about Esterhazy?

619
00:53:41,368 --> 00:53:44,394
We've got to do something
before the public...

620
00:53:44,604 --> 00:53:46,435
We shall. Don't worry.

621
00:53:47,974 --> 00:53:50,442
Present arms!

622
00:53:50,610 --> 00:53:53,636
"In the name of France,
the court-martial, having heard...

623
00:53:53,813 --> 00:53:58,045
...the charge of treason brought against
Commandant Walsin-Esterhazy...

624
00:53:58,218 --> 00:54:03,155
...unanimously agrees that he was
and is innocent of any suspicion of guilt.

625
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:07,783
He is therefore acquitted of said charge
and granted his immediate freedom."

626
00:54:07,961 --> 00:54:11,863
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

627
00:54:12,032 --> 00:54:14,626
Thank you. Thank you, Will.

628
00:54:15,635 --> 00:54:18,069
This will teach Madame Dreyfus a lesson.

629
00:54:18,238 --> 00:54:21,537
I hope it'll discourage her
and her confounded appeals.

630
00:54:21,708 --> 00:54:24,973
Nevertheless, we'll continue
to have her carefully watched.

631
00:55:03,283 --> 00:55:04,750
"My dear Zola...

632
00:55:05,185 --> 00:55:08,382
...l'm certain you will be happy
to learn I have succeeded...

633
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:11,023
...in inducing my colleagues
to consider you...

634
00:55:11,191 --> 00:55:13,523
...for membership in the French Academy.

635
00:55:13,927 --> 00:55:18,955
You need not fear their decision, for they
know that your imperishable works...

636
00:55:19,132 --> 00:55:22,568
...and your noble accomplishments
entitle you above all others...

637
00:55:22,836 --> 00:55:25,964
...to be named among the immortals
of France.

638
00:55:27,540 --> 00:55:30,634
With assurances
of my deepest sincerity...

639
00:55:30,910 --> 00:55:33,003
...Francois Coppee."

640
00:55:33,947 --> 00:55:36,916
The academy, at last.

641
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:40,447
They can deny me no longer.

642
00:55:42,722 --> 00:55:46,556
Now, my dear, there's nothing more
for me to desire.

643
00:55:52,132 --> 00:55:54,532
Pardon, monsieur.
There's a lady to see you.

644
00:55:54,701 --> 00:55:56,669
- A lady?
- Madame Dreyfus, monsieur.

645
00:55:56,836 --> 00:55:58,497
Dreyfus?

646
00:55:58,905 --> 00:56:00,896
- You didn't tell her I was home?
- Yes...

647
00:56:01,074 --> 00:56:03,304
You blockhead!
Why didn't you come ask me?!

648
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:07,810
- The lady will hear you, Émile.
- You knew I was busy.

649
00:56:09,749 --> 00:56:13,845
- Well, well, well. Just ask her to come in.
- Yes, sir.

650
00:56:22,429 --> 00:56:24,761
Madame Dreyfus, please.

651
00:56:39,212 --> 00:56:41,544
- Madame Dreyfus?
- Yes, Monsieur Zola.

652
00:56:41,714 --> 00:56:44,410
Please forgive me for intruding like this...

653
00:56:44,584 --> 00:56:47,553
...but I had to see you,
talk to you about my husband.

654
00:56:47,720 --> 00:56:50,814
But, madame, what can I do
for your husband?

655
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:54,756
He's innocent, monsieur.
I've absolute proof here.

656
00:56:54,928 --> 00:56:56,919
But no one will listen to me. No one.

657
00:56:57,097 --> 00:56:59,793
Naturally, as his wife,
you believe him innocent...

658
00:56:59,966 --> 00:57:01,695
...but he was lawfully convicted.

659
00:57:01,868 --> 00:57:04,894
Lawfully convicted of a crime
he did not commit.

660
00:57:05,071 --> 00:57:06,470
Oh, Monsieur Zola...

661
00:57:06,639 --> 00:57:10,200
...you're the only man in all of France
who can make them listen.

662
00:57:10,376 --> 00:57:12,970
All your life, you've stood
for truth and justice.

663
00:57:13,146 --> 00:57:16,775
I'm hardly the man to help you. I...

664
00:57:16,950 --> 00:57:20,818
I'm just an ordinary citizen, and l...

665
00:57:20,987 --> 00:57:25,924
Besides, I have my work,
my books to write. I can't...

666
00:57:27,227 --> 00:57:30,390
What is this new proof
you say you have?

667
00:57:30,563 --> 00:57:33,327
- A certain Colonel Picquart...
- Oh, that.

668
00:57:33,500 --> 00:57:36,594
It was all in the papers.
Picquart came back from Africa...

669
00:57:36,769 --> 00:57:39,363
...and accused Esterhazy of writing
the <i>bordereau</i>.

670
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:40,972
Esterhazy was acquitted.

671
00:57:41,274 --> 00:57:45,472
Of course he was. Acquitted by the same
army group that convicted my husband.

672
00:57:45,645 --> 00:57:48,910
But don't you see?
They had to acquit Esterhazy...

673
00:57:49,082 --> 00:57:52,643
...to save the face of the general staff.
They'll stop at nothing...

674
00:57:52,819 --> 00:57:56,414
...to protect themselves,
even to sacrificing one of their own class.

675
00:57:56,923 --> 00:57:59,687
That's fantastic. Childish, madame.

676
00:57:59,893 --> 00:58:02,987
The general staff has more important work
to do than...

677
00:58:03,163 --> 00:58:06,257
What do you mean,
"sacrificing one of their own class"?

678
00:58:06,533 --> 00:58:10,333
Colonel Picquart has been arrested
and imprisoned in Mount Valerien.

679
00:58:11,204 --> 00:58:13,434
They've arrested Picquart?

680
00:58:14,607 --> 00:58:15,904
Well, why?

681
00:58:16,075 --> 00:58:18,600
- What had he done?
- Nothing.

682
00:58:18,778 --> 00:58:20,678
Nothing except speak the truth.

683
00:58:20,847 --> 00:58:24,806
But, madame, we must deal in facts,
not irony.

684
00:58:24,984 --> 00:58:28,715
I have all the facts, Monsieur Zola. Here.

685
00:58:29,122 --> 00:58:32,990
These are letters written to Picquart
by the assistant chief of staff...

686
00:58:33,159 --> 00:58:36,458
...proving beyond doubt
that the general staff knows...

687
00:58:36,629 --> 00:58:39,291
...my husband is innocent
and Esterhazy is guilty.

688
00:58:40,099 --> 00:58:43,330
Well, why weren't these used
in the Esterhazy court-martial?

689
00:58:43,636 --> 00:58:45,729
Colonel Picquart's a good soldier.

690
00:58:45,905 --> 00:58:49,705
He kept silent at the command
of his superiors.

691
00:58:50,276 --> 00:58:52,540
You mean they knew...

692
00:58:52,712 --> 00:58:55,909
...and ordered him to suppress the truth?

693
00:58:56,082 --> 00:58:57,777
Why, that's monstrous.

694
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:01,682
Oh, Monsieur Zola, you will help,
won't you?

695
00:59:02,922 --> 00:59:05,322
How can anyone help you?

696
00:59:05,491 --> 00:59:09,018
All France believes your husband guilty,
hates him as a traitor.

697
00:59:09,195 --> 00:59:12,426
They would destroy any man
that would dare champion him.

698
00:59:12,599 --> 00:59:14,999
There must be some way
to right this wrong.

699
00:59:15,168 --> 00:59:18,501
Your husband's case is closed.
There's nothing that can be done.

700
00:59:18,671 --> 00:59:19,933
Nothing.

701
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:24,269
Unless some fool were to publicly
accuse the general staff...

702
00:59:24,444 --> 00:59:27,504
...and get himself dragged into court
on a charge of libel.

703
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:29,671
Then, possibly, they would...

704
00:59:29,849 --> 00:59:33,250
I've lived my life.
I've had enough of fighting...

705
00:59:33,419 --> 00:59:38,652
...turmoil, strife. I'm happy,
contented here. Why should I...

706
00:59:39,926 --> 00:59:42,258
I'm sorry, Monsieur Zola.

707
00:59:42,428 --> 00:59:46,159
It was only my despair
that brought me here.

708
00:59:46,532 --> 00:59:51,731
I was thinking of my husband,
condemned to suffer a living death.

709
00:59:52,305 --> 00:59:56,241
I dared to hope that perhaps
if you would...

710
01:00:03,216 --> 01:00:05,275
Madame, if I could...

711
01:00:32,979 --> 01:00:34,844
Madame Dreyfus!

712
01:00:35,348 --> 01:00:36,975
Madame Dreyfus!

713
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,374
- Hello, Clemenceau.
- Labori.

714
01:02:09,542 --> 01:02:13,103
- Why has Zola called us here?
- I know no more about it than you.

715
01:02:13,279 --> 01:02:14,507
Hello.

716
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:17,012
How do you do, Madame Dreyfus?
Do you know...?

717
01:02:17,183 --> 01:02:21,313
- I asked him for his help, but maybe...
- Why involve Zola in this hopeless mess?

718
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:25,048
Absolutely useless, beyond all remedy.
Oh, here he is.

719
01:02:25,458 --> 01:02:28,859
- Oh, hello, Émile.
- Hello, Anatole.

720
01:02:29,061 --> 01:02:30,551
Labori.

721
01:02:31,230 --> 01:02:33,926
- You're going to be busy.
- What are you going to do?

722
01:02:34,100 --> 01:02:35,965
- Explode a bomb.
- A bomb?

723
01:02:36,135 --> 01:02:38,160
Thank you for coming, all of you.

724
01:02:38,638 --> 01:02:40,868
- What is it?
- A letter...

725
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:42,974
...to the president of the republic.

726
01:02:44,911 --> 01:02:47,379
"Mr. President of the republic...

727
01:02:48,014 --> 01:02:52,314
...permit me to tell you
that your record without blame so far...

728
01:02:52,652 --> 01:02:55,348
...is threatened with a most shameful blot:

729
01:02:55,688 --> 01:02:58,452
This abominable Dreyfus affair.

730
01:02:58,724 --> 01:03:01,318
A court-martial has recently, by order...

731
01:03:01,561 --> 01:03:08,023
...dared to acquit one Esterhazy,
a supreme slap at all truth, all justice.

732
01:03:08,568 --> 01:03:12,436
But since they have dared,
I too shall dare.

733
01:03:12,605 --> 01:03:16,063
I shall tell the truth.
Because if I did not...

734
01:03:16,242 --> 01:03:19,439
...my nights would be haunted
by the specter of a man...

735
01:03:19,612 --> 01:03:25,141
...expiating, under the most frightful
torture, a crime he never committed.

736
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:29,150
It is impossible for honest people
to read the bill of accusation...

737
01:03:29,322 --> 01:03:32,587
...against Dreyfus
without being overcome with indignation...

738
01:03:32,758 --> 01:03:35,989
...and crying out their revulsion.

739
01:03:36,729 --> 01:03:41,223
Dreyfus knows several languages. Crime.

740
01:03:41,567 --> 01:03:45,003
He works hard. Crime.

741
01:03:45,171 --> 01:03:49,801
No compromising papers are found
in his apartment. Crime.

742
01:03:49,976 --> 01:03:54,345
He goes occasionally
to the country of his origin. Crime.

743
01:03:54,514 --> 01:03:57,711
He endeavors to learn everything. Crime.

744
01:03:57,884 --> 01:04:02,844
He's not easily worried. Crime.
He is easily worried. Also a crime.

745
01:04:03,289 --> 01:04:06,520
The minister of war,
the chief of the general staff...

746
01:04:06,692 --> 01:04:10,788
...and the assistant chief never doubted
that the famous <i>bordereau</i>...

747
01:04:10,963 --> 01:04:12,794
...was written by Esterhazy...

748
01:04:12,965 --> 01:04:18,699
...but the condemnation of Esterhazy
involved revision of the Dreyfus verdict...

749
01:04:18,871 --> 01:04:22,363
...and that the general staff
wished to avoid at all cost.

750
01:04:22,775 --> 01:04:27,678
For over a year, the minister of war
and the general staff have known...

751
01:04:27,847 --> 01:04:30,145
...that Dreyfus is innocent...

752
01:04:30,316 --> 01:04:33,410
...but they have kept this knowledge
to themselves.

753
01:04:34,153 --> 01:04:36,314
And those men sleep...

754
01:04:36,622 --> 01:04:39,455
...and they have wives
and children they love.

755
01:04:41,524 --> 01:04:44,925
One speaks of the honor of the army.

756
01:04:45,095 --> 01:04:48,462
The army is the people of France
themselves...

757
01:04:49,032 --> 01:04:53,093
...and the Dreyfus affair is a matter
pertaining to that army.

758
01:04:53,270 --> 01:04:57,036
Dreyfus cannot be vindicated without
condemning the whole general staff.

759
01:04:57,474 --> 01:05:01,706
That is why the general staff
has screened Esterhazy:

760
01:05:01,878 --> 01:05:04,847
To demolish Dreyfus once more.

761
01:05:05,015 --> 01:05:08,451
Such, then, Mr. President,
is the simple truth.

762
01:05:08,818 --> 01:05:10,752
It is a fearful truth.

763
01:05:11,187 --> 01:05:15,021
But I affirm, with intense conviction...

764
01:05:15,191 --> 01:05:19,855
...the truth is on the march,
and nothing will stop it.

765
01:05:21,898 --> 01:05:23,422
Mr. President...

766
01:05:23,600 --> 01:05:28,230
...I accuse Colonel Dort of having been
the diabolical agent of the affair...

767
01:05:28,405 --> 01:05:30,930
...and of continuing to defend
his deadly work...

768
01:05:31,107 --> 01:05:34,235
...through three years
of revolting machination.

769
01:05:34,411 --> 01:05:37,972
I accuse the minister of war
of having concealed decisive proofs...

770
01:05:38,148 --> 01:05:40,241
...of the innocence of Dreyfus.

771
01:05:40,417 --> 01:05:43,477
I accuse the chief of staff
and assistant chief of staff...

772
01:05:43,653 --> 01:05:45,712
...of being accomplices in the crime.

773
01:05:45,889 --> 01:05:50,690
I accuse the commander of the Paris
garrison of the most monstrous partiality.

774
01:05:51,194 --> 01:05:54,857
I accuse the war office of having
viciously led a campaign...

775
01:05:55,031 --> 01:05:57,795
...to misdirect public opinion
and cover up its sins.

776
01:05:58,134 --> 01:06:01,626
I accuse the first court-martial
of violating all human rights...

777
01:06:01,805 --> 01:06:05,400
...in condemning a prisoner
on testimony kept secret from him.

778
01:06:05,575 --> 01:06:07,133
And finally...

779
01:06:07,310 --> 01:06:09,904
...I accuse the Esterhazy court-martial...

780
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:13,641
...of covering up this illegality by order,
thus, in turn...

781
01:06:13,817 --> 01:06:18,447
...committing the judicial crime
of acquitting a guilty man.

782
01:06:19,155 --> 01:06:23,524
In making these accusations,
I am aware that I render myself...

783
01:06:23,693 --> 01:06:28,926
...open to persecution for libel,
but that does not matter.

784
01:06:29,099 --> 01:06:32,466
The action I take is designed
only to hasten...

785
01:06:32,635 --> 01:06:35,798
...the explosion of truth and justice.

786
01:06:35,972 --> 01:06:40,932
Let there be a trial
in the full light of day.

787
01:06:41,478 --> 01:06:42,706
I am waiting."

788
01:06:58,595 --> 01:07:02,531
The reputation of the army is in danger
if we overlook this attack of Zola.

789
01:07:02,699 --> 01:07:05,065
We can't allow him to go on.

790
01:07:05,235 --> 01:07:07,100
I'll see to that.

791
01:07:09,506 --> 01:07:12,839
Brucker, Montaigne, Marsac.
I have special work for you.

792
01:07:13,910 --> 01:07:15,810
A fine state our country is in...

793
01:07:15,979 --> 01:07:20,313
...if a fellow like Zola dares to tell us
how our army is rotten.

794
01:07:31,995 --> 01:07:33,860
Stop that!

795
01:07:36,866 --> 01:07:38,857
What are you doing?! Stop it!

796
01:07:47,243 --> 01:07:49,905
Burn the traitors Dreyfus and Zola!

797
01:08:02,392 --> 01:08:04,883
- There's Zola himself.
- Let's get him.

798
01:08:30,053 --> 01:08:35,491
- Émile, what's happened to you?
- A big crowd. They were after me.

799
01:08:35,658 --> 01:08:40,027
- Is it because of...?
- Yes. My article, "I Accuse...!"

800
01:08:40,196 --> 01:08:45,634
No matter what happens... But I'm afraid
there will be more serious trouble for you.

801
01:08:45,802 --> 01:08:47,633
Monsieur Zola.

802
01:08:47,971 --> 01:08:50,599
This man has been waiting
for you all afternoon, Émile.

803
01:08:59,782 --> 01:09:03,718
There it is.
It's the court summons.

804
01:09:04,454 --> 01:09:06,217
"You are accused..."

805
01:09:06,589 --> 01:09:09,114
- accused of having,
in a newspaper article...

806
01:09:09,292 --> 01:09:12,227
...defamed the members
of the Esterhazy court-martial...

807
01:09:12,395 --> 01:09:16,229
...in acquitting Esterhazy
by order of the high command.

808
01:09:18,334 --> 01:09:21,326
Down with Zola!

809
01:09:28,511 --> 01:09:31,947
Down with Zola!

810
01:09:32,482 --> 01:09:34,211
Quiet!

811
01:09:35,051 --> 01:09:36,575
Quiet, please!

812
01:09:36,753 --> 01:09:40,746
If there is any further demonstration,
I'll have the court cleared.

813
01:09:41,925 --> 01:09:45,793
Mr. Advocate General, you may proceed.

814
01:09:48,998 --> 01:09:52,126
The defense will restrict itself
to the single fact...

815
01:09:52,302 --> 01:09:55,738
...that Zola accused the court-martial
of acquitting Esterhazy...

816
01:09:55,905 --> 01:09:57,668
...by order of the high command.

817
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:02,140
But that's intolerable.
Zola's accusations cover a wide field...

818
01:10:02,312 --> 01:10:06,476
...yet you are allowed to confine us
to six lines of his complete article.

819
01:10:06,649 --> 01:10:10,380
Zola's accusations were intended
to reopen the Dreyfus case...

820
01:10:10,553 --> 01:10:13,784
...regardless of the evil effect
it might have on the country.

821
01:10:13,957 --> 01:10:16,983
That case was closed four years ago
and won't be reopened.

822
01:10:17,226 --> 01:10:20,423
How can you defend Zola
unless the Dreyfus case is discussed?

823
01:10:20,597 --> 01:10:22,462
One is interlocked with the other.

824
01:10:22,865 --> 01:10:25,834
Are you asking my advice
on how to conduct your defense?

825
01:10:26,002 --> 01:10:28,664
- That is not my business.
- Then it must be mine.

826
01:10:28,838 --> 01:10:31,500
You won't be permitted
to introduce a closed case.

827
01:10:31,674 --> 01:10:34,438
- Who is your first witness?
- The minister of war.

828
01:10:34,611 --> 01:10:39,844
The minister of justice declines to allow
the minister of war to testify in this case.

829
01:10:40,016 --> 01:10:42,951
I will call the chief of general staff.

830
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:47,249
The chief of staff regrets that the
minister of war won't allow him to testify.

831
01:10:47,423 --> 01:10:49,687
The assistant chief of staff, then.

832
01:10:50,126 --> 01:10:53,357
The assistant chief of staff regrets
that the chief of staff...

833
01:10:53,529 --> 01:10:55,053
And Colonel Dort?

834
01:10:55,231 --> 01:10:58,826
He regrets that duties imposed upon him
by the assistant chief of...

835
01:10:59,002 --> 01:11:03,598
Officers are not an exempt class,
and I insist on their testifying!

836
01:11:03,773 --> 01:11:06,970
I demand that this court be recessed
until my applications...

837
01:11:07,143 --> 01:11:11,170
...to introduce the Dreyfus case
and call military witnesses is agreed upon.

838
01:11:11,347 --> 01:11:16,717
You will submit your request in writing
in the usual form. The court is recessed.

839
01:11:25,361 --> 01:11:27,727
Quick! Give Brucker the signal.

840
01:11:33,236 --> 01:11:35,636
Down with Zola!

841
01:11:44,447 --> 01:11:47,439
Gentlemen, the court!

842
01:11:55,892 --> 01:11:58,122
Military witnesses may be called...

843
01:11:58,294 --> 01:12:01,957
...provided the defense does not violate
their professional secrecy.

844
01:12:02,131 --> 01:12:05,328
Attendant, conduct the witnesses
to their room.

845
01:12:05,501 --> 01:12:09,904
- What about the Dreyfus case?
- Referencing it will not be allowed.

846
01:12:10,339 --> 01:12:13,502
Mr. President,
if Dreyfus was justly condemned...

847
01:12:13,676 --> 01:12:17,339
...a full inquiry now would give
that condemnation increased weight...

848
01:12:17,513 --> 01:12:19,538
...and we would lose our case.

849
01:12:19,716 --> 01:12:23,482
If the prosecution does not fear
what a reopening would reveal...

850
01:12:23,653 --> 01:12:26,986
...why does it not take
this easy means to defeat us?

851
01:12:27,156 --> 01:12:30,751
You have heard the ruling of the court.
Who is your first witness?

852
01:12:34,363 --> 01:12:35,625
Colonel Picquart.

853
01:12:35,965 --> 01:12:39,332
Attendant,
call Colonel Picquart to the stand.

854
01:12:41,604 --> 01:12:43,834
Colonel Picquart.

855
01:12:55,418 --> 01:12:59,184
- Your name?
- Georges Picquart, Mr. President.

856
01:12:59,355 --> 01:13:01,346
Take the oath.

857
01:13:01,591 --> 01:13:04,492
Do you swear to tell the truth
without hatred or fear?

858
01:13:04,660 --> 01:13:06,184
I swear.

859
01:13:07,697 --> 01:13:10,063
What do you wish to ask the witness?

860
01:13:10,233 --> 01:13:14,226
I'd like to ask him the circumstance
under which he first suspected...

861
01:13:14,403 --> 01:13:19,363
...that Esterhazy, and not Dreyfus,
was the author of the <i>bordereau</i>.

862
01:13:19,575 --> 01:13:22,738
You have heard the question. Answer it.

863
01:13:22,912 --> 01:13:27,406
In May 1896,
while I was chief of intelligence...

864
01:13:27,583 --> 01:13:30,848
...I received parts of a torn letter
addressed to Esterhazy...

865
01:13:31,020 --> 01:13:33,955
...from the representative
of a foreign power.

866
01:13:34,123 --> 01:13:37,581
I obtained Esterhazy's letter
and compared it with the <i>bordereau</i>.

867
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:39,785
Both writings were Esterhazy's.

868
01:13:39,962 --> 01:13:42,726
This was confirmed
by Esterhazy's banker.

869
01:13:42,899 --> 01:13:46,164
I was convinced that Esterhazy
had written the <i>bordereau</i>.

870
01:13:46,335 --> 01:13:49,793
I gave this proof of Esterhazy's guilt
to the general staff.

871
01:13:49,972 --> 01:13:53,703
Was Esterhazy informed
that Colonel Picquart suspected him?

872
01:13:53,876 --> 01:13:55,605
Naturally.

873
01:13:56,512 --> 01:14:01,006
And the warning originated from a certain
intelligence officer of the general staff.

874
01:14:01,184 --> 01:14:02,617
Stop!

875
01:14:05,488 --> 01:14:07,422
You're lying!

876
01:14:09,325 --> 01:14:11,623
Silence. Silence!

877
01:14:11,794 --> 01:14:15,696
Now I will tell everything. I will tell
why I was sent to North Africa.

878
01:14:15,865 --> 01:14:19,266
Gentlemen of the jury, I will tell why
men like Colonel Henry...

879
01:14:19,435 --> 01:14:22,768
...have made the most vile accusations
against me without proof.

880
01:14:22,939 --> 01:14:25,737
Gentlemen, if you but knew why
all this is being done!

881
01:14:25,908 --> 01:14:28,934
<i>La patrie</i>! <i>La patrie</i>!
You disgrace me!

882
01:14:29,111 --> 01:14:31,773
Gentlemen! Well, I...

883
01:14:32,148 --> 01:14:33,615
Silence. Silence!

884
01:14:37,753 --> 01:14:40,119
- May I?
- Certainly, general.

885
01:14:40,423 --> 01:14:43,620
The whole campaign of the defense
is extraordinary.

886
01:14:43,793 --> 01:14:48,423
But the most deplorable spectacle of all to
me, as commander of the garrison of Paris...

887
01:14:48,598 --> 01:14:51,761
...is that of an officer still wearing
the French uniform...

888
01:14:51,934 --> 01:14:54,801
...who slanders his superiors
and his comrades.

889
01:14:54,971 --> 01:14:58,236
- Long live the army!
- But not its generals!

890
01:15:01,811 --> 01:15:04,336
Silence! Silence!

891
01:15:08,417 --> 01:15:11,250
I cannot tolerate in silence
these accusations...

892
01:15:11,420 --> 01:15:14,514
...that the law was violated
by court-martial officers...

893
01:15:14,690 --> 01:15:17,659
...who shed their blood
on the battlefields of France...

894
01:15:17,827 --> 01:15:20,819
...while others stab her in the back.

895
01:15:22,465 --> 01:15:26,026
Each serves his country
in his own way:

896
01:15:26,202 --> 01:15:30,070
One with a sword,
the other with a pen.

897
01:15:30,806 --> 01:15:35,209
Posterity will choose
between your name and mine.

898
01:15:35,378 --> 01:15:40,816
I will not stand these insults to men
intent only on doing their duty!

899
01:15:40,983 --> 01:15:44,282
Gentlemen of the jury,
it is outrageous, traitorous...

900
01:15:44,720 --> 01:15:49,123
...to deprive the army of confidence
in its chiefs in the day of danger!

901
01:15:49,292 --> 01:15:52,318
And, believe me,
it is nearer than you think!

902
01:15:52,495 --> 01:15:57,023
Gentlemen, it is your sons who will be
called on to defend France...

903
01:15:57,199 --> 01:16:02,330
...while Monsieur Zola will stay at home
and write a new <i>Downfall</i>.

904
01:16:02,705 --> 01:16:06,869
He will continue to make France famous
throughout the world.

905
01:16:07,043 --> 01:16:12,310
- A France that will have ceased to exist!
- Long live the army!

906
01:16:12,782 --> 01:16:15,410
Bravo. Bravo. Well acted, general.

907
01:16:15,584 --> 01:16:18,178
Although there is no war
nor danger of war...

908
01:16:18,354 --> 01:16:20,686
...you gave a very good performance.

909
01:16:20,856 --> 01:16:25,555
But you did not utter a single word
to prove that Esterhazy was not guilty.

910
01:16:29,699 --> 01:16:34,227
You cannot stop me from showing how he
tried to work on the sentiment of the jury!

911
01:16:34,403 --> 01:16:37,702
I'll say what I have to say
if this trial lasts six months!

912
01:16:37,873 --> 01:16:40,569
Monsieur Labori, address the court.

913
01:16:40,743 --> 01:16:43,211
The general staff spoke as it pleased...

914
01:16:43,379 --> 01:16:45,904
...the commander of Paris
influenced the jury...

915
01:16:46,082 --> 01:16:49,677
...but the defense can say nothing.
Never has such a thing been seen.

916
01:16:50,052 --> 01:16:51,610
What's your next question?

917
01:16:51,887 --> 01:16:54,481
What is Colonel Picquart's
present address?

918
01:16:54,657 --> 01:16:57,888
Mount Valerien fortress,
under military arrest.

919
01:16:58,060 --> 01:17:00,187
Did he know that
by exposing Esterhazy...

920
01:17:00,363 --> 01:17:04,993
...he was jeopardizing his army career
and might end up in an army prison?

921
01:17:05,167 --> 01:17:07,294
Not at first. I did later.

922
01:17:07,470 --> 01:17:11,304
Did he know that by attempting
to secure justice for Dreyfus...

923
01:17:11,474 --> 01:17:14,238
You cannot put that question.
The Dreyfus case is closed.

924
01:17:28,090 --> 01:17:30,183
That heat.

925
01:18:46,168 --> 01:18:48,227
Madame Dreyfus.

926
01:19:07,857 --> 01:19:09,347
Quiet. Quiet!

927
01:19:11,293 --> 01:19:14,091
- Your name, please.
- Lucie Dreyfus.

928
01:19:14,263 --> 01:19:18,563
- Your occupation.
- Captain's wife.

929
01:19:18,934 --> 01:19:22,836
Never mind.
What question do you wish to put?

930
01:19:24,406 --> 01:19:26,533
Will she tell us
under what condition...

931
01:19:26,709 --> 01:19:30,167
...she learned from Commandant Dort
of her husband's arrest?

932
01:19:30,346 --> 01:19:32,576
The question will not be put.

933
01:19:34,283 --> 01:19:36,717
What was Dort's attitude
on that occasion?

934
01:19:36,886 --> 01:19:39,616
Did he threaten her to say nothing
of what occurred?

935
01:19:39,788 --> 01:19:42,120
The question will not be put.

936
01:19:43,225 --> 01:19:45,352
Will she kindly tell us her opinion...

937
01:19:45,528 --> 01:19:48,463
...of the good faith of Zola
in bringing these charges?

938
01:19:48,797 --> 01:19:52,062
That is irrelevant to this case.
The question will not be put.

939
01:19:52,234 --> 01:19:56,933
I demand for my client the right granted
even to assassins and thieves:

940
01:19:57,106 --> 01:19:58,596
To have my witnesses speak.

941
01:19:59,108 --> 01:20:02,805
Questions relating
to a closed case are prohibited.

942
01:20:02,978 --> 01:20:05,776
Madame Dreyfus,
you may leave the stand.

943
01:20:05,948 --> 01:20:09,179
Mr. President, I protest!

944
01:20:14,056 --> 01:20:17,651
They wouldn't let me speak
of my husband's innocence.

945
01:20:17,860 --> 01:20:21,694
Not even a word of my gratitude
to Monsieur Zola.

946
01:20:21,864 --> 01:20:23,695
My husband doesn't want to be thanked.

947
01:20:25,267 --> 01:20:29,294
- Who will be your next witness?
- Commandant Esterhazy.

948
01:20:30,105 --> 01:20:33,734
Before we hear his testimony,
the courtroom will be cleared.

949
01:20:44,153 --> 01:20:46,485
Commandant Esterhazy.

950
01:20:48,390 --> 01:20:50,950
- I'm not going in there.
- Shut up, you fool.

951
01:20:51,126 --> 01:20:53,458
This has gone too far
for you to let us down.

952
01:20:53,629 --> 01:20:57,565
It's not a question of Dreyfus now,
it's all of us. So watch yourself.

953
01:20:59,535 --> 01:21:02,231
Don't do anything foolish,
even if they provoke you.

954
01:21:02,404 --> 01:21:05,237
Wait a minute.
You haven't got a gun, have you?

955
01:21:18,787 --> 01:21:21,756
Do you swear to speak the truth
without hatred or fear...

956
01:21:21,924 --> 01:21:24,449
...the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

957
01:21:24,627 --> 01:21:25,855
I swear.

958
01:21:26,295 --> 01:21:27,660
Ask your first question.

959
01:21:27,997 --> 01:21:30,488
Did he write the secret document...

960
01:21:30,666 --> 01:21:34,158
...containing coded military information
known as the <i>bordereau</i>?

961
01:21:34,336 --> 01:21:37,237
- I shall not answer.
- How did he enter the French army?

962
01:21:37,406 --> 01:21:38,668
I will not answer him.

963
01:21:38,841 --> 01:21:41,742
Didn't he first offer his services
to the Turkish army?

964
01:21:41,910 --> 01:21:45,038
Didn't Commandant Esterhazy
write this letter?

965
01:21:45,214 --> 01:21:48,081
"I would be happy to die
sabering Frenchmen...

966
01:21:48,250 --> 01:21:51,378
...as a captain of German uhlans."

967
01:21:51,553 --> 01:21:56,820
Didn't he try to have a perfectly sane
secret service agent certified as insane...

968
01:21:56,992 --> 01:22:02,726
...because he described the commandant
as visiting a foreign military attaché?

969
01:22:02,898 --> 01:22:05,526
Did Commandant Esterhazy
not have dealings...

970
01:22:05,701 --> 01:22:08,670
...with the military attaché
Colonel von Schwartzkoppen?

971
01:22:08,837 --> 01:22:12,170
I will not permit that question.
It involves our foreign policy.

972
01:22:12,341 --> 01:22:13,831
I'll put it differently.

973
01:22:14,009 --> 01:22:18,105
Didn't he admit to newspaper reporters
negotiating with von Schwartzkoppen?

974
01:22:18,280 --> 01:22:22,376
The question will not be put. France's
honor and security mustn't be touched.

975
01:22:22,785 --> 01:22:24,946
I see.
The honor and security of France...

976
01:22:25,120 --> 01:22:27,918
...permit an officer to do things
but not discuss them.

977
01:22:28,223 --> 01:22:32,455
Did he tell an English journalist
that if Zola was acquitted...

978
01:22:32,628 --> 01:22:36,086
...the streets of Paris would be strewn
with 100,000 corpses?

979
01:22:36,265 --> 01:22:37,527
Mr. President.

980
01:22:37,900 --> 01:22:41,461
- Colonel Henry, you wish to take the stand?
- Lf you please.

981
01:22:42,805 --> 01:22:46,172
We've tried to honor the court
and exclude the Dreyfus affair...

982
01:22:46,342 --> 01:22:49,834
...but the defense makes it impossible.
They claim they want light.

983
01:22:50,012 --> 01:22:52,071
Very well.
Now they're going to have it.

984
01:22:52,247 --> 01:22:56,707
We've long had final, positive proof
that Dreyfus was guilty of treason.

985
01:22:56,885 --> 01:23:01,379
A secret document unknown at the time
of the Dreyfus trial fell into our hands.

986
01:23:01,557 --> 01:23:05,823
It was written by one foreign military
attaché to another, containing the words:

987
01:23:05,994 --> 01:23:09,930
"Don't tell anyone of your connection
with this office or deed."

988
01:23:10,099 --> 01:23:13,967
Every time a general officer takes
his hat off, a secret document pops up.

989
01:23:14,136 --> 01:23:17,731
Dreyfus was sacrificed to one.
My client is threatened with another.

990
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:19,564
Give this to Monsieur Labori.

991
01:23:19,742 --> 01:23:21,937
Will Colonel Henry
produce that document?

992
01:23:22,111 --> 01:23:26,605
It will endanger relations with foreign
powers if secret documents were revealed.

993
01:23:26,782 --> 01:23:29,080
- Where is it?
- My word should be sufficient.

994
01:23:29,251 --> 01:23:32,186
Words are no longer good enough.
Where is that document?

995
01:23:32,354 --> 01:23:35,551
You have already been told
it cannot be brought here.

996
01:23:35,724 --> 01:23:36,986
Call your next witness.

997
01:23:37,159 --> 01:23:40,026
I will not proceed
until that document is produced.

998
01:23:40,195 --> 01:23:44,461
- Call your next witness.
- No, no and no, Mr. President!

999
01:23:44,633 --> 01:23:47,659
Not until this court rules
or that document is produced.

1000
01:23:47,836 --> 01:23:50,361
It is not in my power to produce it.

1001
01:23:50,539 --> 01:23:52,700
Perhaps the chief of staff.

1002
01:23:56,145 --> 01:23:58,670
May I add further information
on this subject?

1003
01:23:58,847 --> 01:24:02,044
Certainly, general.
Please take the stand.

1004
01:24:03,485 --> 01:24:08,115
I confirm in every point the deposition
of Colonel Henry about that document.

1005
01:24:08,290 --> 01:24:10,690
It absolutely proved Dreyfus' guilt...

1006
01:24:10,859 --> 01:24:13,987
...and it is too dangerous
to reveal in public.

1007
01:24:14,163 --> 01:24:19,260
You of the jury, you represent the nation.
If that nation hasn't confidence in us...

1008
01:24:19,435 --> 01:24:24,134
...the heads of the army,
at this critical time, then I shall resign.

1009
01:24:24,306 --> 01:24:26,297
- I have no more to say.
- But I have.

1010
01:24:26,475 --> 01:24:29,239
I wish to recall Colonel Picquart
to the stand.

1011
01:24:29,411 --> 01:24:33,575
- No, don't go. Stay here, please.
- Colonel Picquart, please take the stand.

1012
01:24:33,749 --> 01:24:38,914
Will Colonel Picquart tell us what he knows
about this mysterious secret document?

1013
01:24:40,055 --> 01:24:44,321
The document came to my attention while
I was chief of the intelligence service.

1014
01:24:44,493 --> 01:24:48,657
Inasmuch as it was secret,
it was my duty to say nothing about it.

1015
01:24:48,831 --> 01:24:52,062
As it has been openly mentioned here
by my superior officer...

1016
01:24:52,234 --> 01:24:56,102
...that restriction no longer applies,
and I shall speak.

1017
01:24:56,271 --> 01:24:58,705
The chief of staff was right
upon one point.

1018
01:24:58,874 --> 01:25:03,641
That secret document is too dangerous
to bring here, but not in the way he means.

1019
01:25:03,812 --> 01:25:06,007
It is too dangerous to the prosecution.

1020
01:25:06,181 --> 01:25:09,947
They dare not produce it
because that document is a forgery...

1021
01:25:10,118 --> 01:25:12,985
...committed by an intelligence officer
in this room...

1022
01:25:13,155 --> 01:25:16,613
...to seal Dreyfus' fate
and save the face of the general staff.

1023
01:25:16,792 --> 01:25:18,953
This is irrelevant to the present trial.

1024
01:25:19,127 --> 01:25:22,790
- I protest this court's partiality.
- For the last time, I warn you!

1025
01:25:22,965 --> 01:25:26,366
These generals, substituting
for arguments their uniform...

1026
01:25:26,535 --> 01:25:28,935
...come to the stand,
even address the jury...

1027
01:25:29,104 --> 01:25:32,870
...violating or invoking professional
secrecy as they find convenient...

1028
01:25:33,041 --> 01:25:34,565
...saying what they please.

1029
01:25:34,743 --> 01:25:38,736
But when I wish to question these
exalted beings and expose the truth...

1030
01:25:38,914 --> 01:25:43,146
...the court bars my questions
before it knows what they are.

1031
01:25:43,318 --> 01:25:45,582
I shall not tolerate
this insult to justice.

1032
01:25:45,754 --> 01:25:48,780
And I will not tolerate
the partiality of this court!

1033
01:25:48,957 --> 01:25:51,323
Officers are allowed to say
what they please.

1034
01:25:51,493 --> 01:25:55,657
Newspapers hostile to Zola are permitted
to threaten and intimidate the jury.

1035
01:25:55,831 --> 01:26:01,292
Crosses mark their doors for the vengeance
of the mob if Zola is acquitted, but if l...

1036
01:26:01,470 --> 01:26:02,732
You cannot go on!

1037
01:26:02,905 --> 01:26:06,068
I'll say what I have to say
if this trial lasts six months!

1038
01:26:06,241 --> 01:26:08,175
Court is adjourned.

1039
01:26:22,124 --> 01:26:24,854
Bravo, Zola!

1040
01:26:30,999 --> 01:26:34,025
As prefect of police,
I insist you leave by the side door.

1041
01:26:34,202 --> 01:26:36,602
Otherwise, I cannot guarantee
your safety.

1042
01:26:36,772 --> 01:26:38,296
I think he's right.

1043
01:26:38,473 --> 01:26:43,809
Thank you very much,
but I shall leave like anyone else.

1044
01:27:22,584 --> 01:27:24,313
Has the jury gone out yet?

1045
01:27:24,486 --> 01:27:27,148
No, the advocate general
is still speaking.

1046
01:27:27,956 --> 01:27:30,481
And Zola sought only publicity.

1047
01:27:30,659 --> 01:27:35,722
That, gentlemen, is the true picture
of their fight for humanity, right and truth.

1048
01:27:36,164 --> 01:27:41,397
It rests with you, gentlemen, to answer
this insulting challenge to our army.

1049
01:27:41,570 --> 01:27:47,031
Zola must be punished,
and all France awaits your verdict.

1050
01:27:47,209 --> 01:27:49,200
Down with Zola!

1051
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:55,581
Quiet. Quiet! Quiet!

1052
01:27:56,618 --> 01:28:00,247
Mr. President, Monsieur Zola requests
that he be allowed to speak.

1053
01:28:00,422 --> 01:28:02,413
Permission granted.

1054
01:28:13,602 --> 01:28:15,331
Gentlemen...

1055
01:28:16,138 --> 01:28:18,663
...in the House of Deputies
a month ago...

1056
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:23,334
...to frantic applause,
the prime minister, Monsieur Maline...

1057
01:28:23,512 --> 01:28:27,642
...declared that he had confidence
in you 12 citizens...

1058
01:28:27,816 --> 01:28:32,082
...into whose hands he had bestowed
the defense of the army.

1059
01:28:32,254 --> 01:28:34,154
In other words...

1060
01:28:34,322 --> 01:28:39,316
...you are being instructed,
by order, to condemn me...

1061
01:28:39,494 --> 01:28:41,485
...just as, in that other case...

1062
01:28:41,663 --> 01:28:45,622
...the minister of war
dictated the acquittal of Esterhazy.

1063
01:28:45,801 --> 01:28:47,393
Down with Zola!

1064
01:28:51,873 --> 01:28:55,536
The prime minister gave
no such order to this jury.

1065
01:28:55,711 --> 01:29:01,172
His words made his intention
to coerce justice unmistakable.

1066
01:29:01,349 --> 01:29:04,614
And I denounce them
to the conscience of honest men.

1067
01:29:04,786 --> 01:29:07,084
Confine yourself to the facts.

1068
01:29:08,657 --> 01:29:10,522
However...

1069
01:29:12,027 --> 01:29:16,361
...my profession is writing,
not talking.

1070
01:29:16,865 --> 01:29:20,028
But from my struggling youth
until today...

1071
01:29:20,202 --> 01:29:23,694
...my principal aim
has been to strive for truth.

1072
01:29:23,872 --> 01:29:25,669
That is why I entered this fight.

1073
01:29:26,208 --> 01:29:31,202
All my friends have told me that it
was insane for a single person...

1074
01:29:31,379 --> 01:29:34,974
...to oppose the immense machinery
of the law...

1075
01:29:35,150 --> 01:29:39,416
...the glory of the army
and the power of the state.

1076
01:29:39,588 --> 01:29:44,753
They warned me that my actions
would be mercilessly crushed...

1077
01:29:44,926 --> 01:29:47,292
...that I would be destroyed.

1078
01:29:47,462 --> 01:29:51,796
But what does it matter
if an individual is shattered...

1079
01:29:51,967 --> 01:29:54,902
...if only justice is resurrected?

1080
01:29:55,804 --> 01:30:00,639
It has been said that the state
summoned me to this court.

1081
01:30:01,409 --> 01:30:06,972
That is not true.
I am here because I wished it.

1082
01:30:07,149 --> 01:30:12,177
I alone have chosen you as my judges.

1083
01:30:12,354 --> 01:30:18,156
I alone decided that this abominable
affair should see the light...

1084
01:30:18,326 --> 01:30:23,525
...so that France might at last know all
and voice her opinion.

1085
01:30:23,698 --> 01:30:29,728
My act has no other object.
My person is of no account.

1086
01:30:29,905 --> 01:30:31,839
I'm satisfied.

1087
01:30:32,741 --> 01:30:37,440
But my confidence in you
was not shared by the state.

1088
01:30:38,113 --> 01:30:42,641
They did not dare say all
about the whole undividable affair...

1089
01:30:42,818 --> 01:30:45,309
...and submit it to your verdict.

1090
01:30:45,487 --> 01:30:49,287
That is no fault of mine.

1091
01:30:49,457 --> 01:30:55,293
You saw for yourselves how my defense
was incessantly silenced.

1092
01:30:55,964 --> 01:30:58,398
Gentlemen, I know you.

1093
01:30:58,733 --> 01:31:03,898
You are the heart,
the intellect of my beloved Paris...

1094
01:31:04,072 --> 01:31:08,566
...where I was born
and which I've studied for 40 years.

1095
01:31:08,743 --> 01:31:11,735
I see you with your families
under the evening lamp.

1096
01:31:11,913 --> 01:31:15,280
I accompany you into your factories,
your shops.

1097
01:31:15,450 --> 01:31:20,513
You're all workers and righteous men.
You will not say, like many:

1098
01:31:20,689 --> 01:31:25,285
"What does it matter if an innocent man
is undergoing torture on Devil's Island?

1099
01:31:25,460 --> 01:31:31,194
Is the suffering of one obscure person
worth the disturbance of a great country?"

1100
01:31:32,634 --> 01:31:37,333
Perhaps, though, you've been told
that by punishing me...

1101
01:31:37,505 --> 01:31:41,703
...you will stop a campaign
that is injurious to France.

1102
01:31:41,877 --> 01:31:45,870
Gentlemen, if that is your idea...

1103
01:31:46,047 --> 01:31:48,015
...you are mistaken.

1104
01:31:48,183 --> 01:31:52,085
Look at me.
Have I the look of a hireling?

1105
01:31:52,254 --> 01:31:55,018
A liar? A traitor?

1106
01:31:55,190 --> 01:31:59,286
I'm only a free writer
who has given his life to work...

1107
01:31:59,461 --> 01:32:05,957
...and who will resume it tomorrow.
And I am not here defending myself.

1108
01:32:06,368 --> 01:32:09,269
Tremendous pressure
has been put upon you.

1109
01:32:09,437 --> 01:32:14,670
"Save the army.
Convict Zola and save France."

1110
01:32:14,843 --> 01:32:19,337
I say to you, pick up that challenge!

1111
01:32:19,514 --> 01:32:23,951
Save the army and save France...

1112
01:32:24,552 --> 01:32:27,612
...but do it by letting truth conquer.

1113
01:32:27,789 --> 01:32:31,088
Not only is an innocent man
crying out for justice...

1114
01:32:31,259 --> 01:32:33,955
...but more. Much more.

1115
01:32:34,129 --> 01:32:39,533
A great nation is in desperate danger
of forfeiting her honor.

1116
01:32:40,368 --> 01:32:43,462
Do not take upon yourselves a fault...

1117
01:32:43,638 --> 01:32:47,836
...the burden of which
you will forever bear in history.

1118
01:32:48,009 --> 01:32:51,240
A judicial blunder has been committed!

1119
01:32:51,413 --> 01:32:56,476
The condemnation of an innocent man
induced the acquittal of a guilty man.

1120
01:32:56,651 --> 01:33:00,712
And now, today,
you're asked to condemn me...

1121
01:33:00,889 --> 01:33:07,124
...because I rebelled on seeing our country
embarked on this terrible course.

1122
01:33:08,496 --> 01:33:14,366
At this solemn moment,
in the presence of this tribunal...

1123
01:33:14,536 --> 01:33:17,664
...which is the representative
of human justice...

1124
01:33:17,839 --> 01:33:20,535
...before you gentlemen of the jury...

1125
01:33:20,709 --> 01:33:24,304
...before France,
before the whole world...

1126
01:33:24,479 --> 01:33:28,176
...I swear that Dreyfus is innocent.

1127
01:33:28,350 --> 01:33:33,014
By my 40 years of work,
by all that I have won...

1128
01:33:33,188 --> 01:33:38,683
...by all that I have written
to spread the spirit of France...

1129
01:33:38,860 --> 01:33:44,298
...I swear that Dreyfus is innocent.
May all that melt away.

1130
01:33:44,466 --> 01:33:49,494
May my name perish
if Dreyfus be not innocent.

1131
01:33:50,805 --> 01:33:52,830
He is innocent.

1132
01:34:00,582 --> 01:34:03,073
Down with Zola!

1133
01:34:14,329 --> 01:34:17,765
This is no punishment,
just a precaution.

1134
01:34:34,315 --> 01:34:37,341
Gentlemen, the court!

1135
01:34:43,425 --> 01:34:45,120
Émile Zola...

1136
01:34:45,293 --> 01:34:47,693
...the jury has found you guilty.

1137
01:34:47,862 --> 01:34:51,320
You are hereby sentenced
to one year's imprisonment...

1138
01:34:51,499 --> 01:34:54,263
...and 3000 francs' fine.

1139
01:35:06,347 --> 01:35:08,372
Cannibals.

1140
01:35:13,021 --> 01:35:16,684
Once before,
the centuries reversed a judgment.

1141
01:35:17,926 --> 01:35:20,952
That too was a closed case.

1142
01:35:30,405 --> 01:35:35,172
- Émile, you must leave France immediately.
- Leave France?

1143
01:35:35,343 --> 01:35:39,973
Yes. Go into hiding. England,
any place where they can't get at you.

1144
01:35:40,148 --> 01:35:43,549
Run away like a common criminal?

1145
01:35:43,751 --> 01:35:47,414
Do you know what you're saying?
You're out of your mind.

1146
01:35:47,856 --> 01:35:53,055
My husband couldn't do such a thing.
It's entirely unworthy of his character.

1147
01:35:53,361 --> 01:35:57,229
- What will people say?
- What would you expect them to say?

1148
01:35:57,398 --> 01:36:00,595
"Zola condemned, Zola in cowardly flight."

1149
01:36:00,768 --> 01:36:03,635
I'd be denounced by my friends
as well as my enemies.

1150
01:36:03,805 --> 01:36:06,399
It's true.
In prison, you'd be a martyr...

1151
01:36:06,574 --> 01:36:09,168
...an object of sympathy
for the entire world.

1152
01:36:09,344 --> 01:36:14,077
But helpless to do anything.
In London, you are all-powerful.

1153
01:36:14,482 --> 01:36:18,851
You can still fight for Dreyfus,
write smashing articles, pamphlets...

1154
01:36:19,020 --> 01:36:22,183
...keep on pricking at
the conscience of the world.

1155
01:36:22,357 --> 01:36:27,590
Émile, there are times when it is
more courageous to be cowardly.

1156
01:36:33,134 --> 01:36:35,034
Alexandrine...

1157
01:36:36,204 --> 01:36:39,139
...pack me a few warm things.

1158
01:36:40,008 --> 01:36:42,442
It must be cold in London.

1159
01:36:44,045 --> 01:36:45,273
Zola in England.

1160
01:36:46,614 --> 01:36:49,378
London police on the lookout.
Zola in England.

1161
01:36:49,551 --> 01:36:51,576
Here you are, governor. Thank you.

1162
01:36:51,753 --> 01:36:55,917
Zola in England.
London police on lookout.

1163
01:36:56,090 --> 01:36:57,557
Zola in England.

1164
01:37:30,525 --> 01:37:32,823
- Are you alone?
- Yes, go in.

1165
01:37:37,632 --> 01:37:41,068
- Well, what is it?
- Well, it's come.

1166
01:37:41,236 --> 01:37:44,467
- What?
- The new war minister has summoned me.

1167
01:37:44,939 --> 01:37:48,102
- You've been what?
- I'm on my way there now.

1168
01:37:48,276 --> 01:37:51,905
- Admit nothing.
- "Admit nothing."

1169
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:56,176
With that cursed Zola still writing,
still stirring up trouble...

1170
01:37:56,351 --> 01:37:59,411
...the whole world screaming
for the truth...

1171
01:37:59,587 --> 01:38:02,488
...duels, newspapers...

1172
01:38:02,657 --> 01:38:05,649
...everyone at each other's throats.

1173
01:38:05,994 --> 01:38:08,462
You can't hold it off much longer.

1174
01:38:08,630 --> 01:38:10,689
You can't, I tell you.

1175
01:38:15,370 --> 01:38:17,497
You got me into this.

1176
01:38:17,672 --> 01:38:21,164
You've gotta stick by me.
Understand?

1177
01:38:23,578 --> 01:38:27,036
Do as I tell you. Admit nothing.

1178
01:38:27,215 --> 01:38:30,013
Then come back
and tell me what they say.

1179
01:38:30,184 --> 01:38:32,152
I'll be waiting for you.

1180
01:38:54,475 --> 01:38:57,706
I want the truth.
The whole truth, Colonel Henry.

1181
01:38:57,879 --> 01:38:59,471
Speak up!

1182
01:39:00,081 --> 01:39:02,743
But, Your Excellency,
the honor of the army...

1183
01:39:02,917 --> 01:39:05,044
I'll hear no more from you
about honor.

1184
01:39:05,219 --> 01:39:09,315
- You're a common forger.
- Your Excellency, I swear I'm not.

1185
01:39:09,490 --> 01:39:15,520
Show him the document that played such
an important part during the Zola trial.

1186
01:39:18,466 --> 01:39:21,128
Take it up. Take it up. Look at it.

1187
01:39:21,302 --> 01:39:22,826
Read it!

1188
01:39:28,576 --> 01:39:31,067
"Don't tell anyone...

1189
01:39:31,245 --> 01:39:34,976
...of your connection with the..."

1190
01:39:35,149 --> 01:39:38,312
I didn't write it!
I had nothing to do with it, I swear!

1191
01:39:38,486 --> 01:39:40,010
You're lying.

1192
01:39:40,188 --> 01:39:44,955
The secret agent who was your accomplice
confessed everything before killing himself.

1193
01:39:46,427 --> 01:39:49,453
I give you one last chance
to tell the truth.

1194
01:39:49,630 --> 01:39:51,894
Did you forge this letter?

1195
01:39:56,537 --> 01:39:57,936
Yes.

1196
01:39:58,806 --> 01:40:03,402
I did it for the army.
I did it for the honor of the army.

1197
01:40:03,778 --> 01:40:05,939
You're under arrest.

1198
01:40:06,114 --> 01:40:09,049
Captain Guignet,
have him taken to the prison.

1199
01:40:09,217 --> 01:40:13,813
- I want a signed confession.
- Not now, sir. I beg you.

1200
01:40:13,988 --> 01:40:18,118
Later, I'll tell everything.
I can't stand anything more now.

1201
01:40:18,292 --> 01:40:21,455
I want a signed confession.
Take him away.

1202
01:40:29,203 --> 01:40:32,764
Our army no longer has room
for men of your kind. Understand?

1203
01:40:32,940 --> 01:40:34,168
Yes, Your Excellency.

1204
01:40:34,342 --> 01:40:37,402
You'll be confined to barracks
until you leave. That's all.

1205
01:40:37,578 --> 01:40:40,513
I think you're making a grave mistake,
Your Excellency.

1206
01:40:40,681 --> 01:40:43,650
The army always has to consider the...

1207
01:40:45,653 --> 01:40:48,588
You'll have my resignation
in the morning.

1208
01:40:53,027 --> 01:40:55,188
Good morning, captain.

1209
01:41:00,635 --> 01:41:04,401
- How's Colonel Henry?
- He did nothing but scream all night.

1210
01:41:04,572 --> 01:41:10,704
Something about the honor of the army.
But he seems to be quiet now.

1211
01:41:15,650 --> 01:41:17,447
Suicide.

1212
01:41:27,595 --> 01:41:29,961
Good morning, Mr. Zola.

1213
01:41:31,265 --> 01:41:34,029
Oh, it's you. Good morning.

1214
01:41:34,202 --> 01:41:38,696
Where's your papa? Will he come back
from the village with my newspapers?

1215
01:41:38,873 --> 01:41:41,706
- He'll be along presently.
- Presently?! Presently!

1216
01:41:41,876 --> 01:41:45,334
The whole world is seething,
nations are crashing to their doom...

1217
01:41:45,513 --> 01:41:47,879
...and he'll be along presently.

1218
01:41:48,649 --> 01:41:51,675
Oh, you cold-blooded English.
You'll be the death of me.

1219
01:41:52,920 --> 01:41:57,084
Émile! It's happened.
It's happened! Look.

1220
01:41:57,258 --> 01:41:59,226
Listen. <i>The Times</i>:

1221
01:41:59,393 --> 01:42:04,262
"Colonel Henry confesses
Dreyfus forgery, then kills himself."

1222
01:42:04,866 --> 01:42:06,424
<i>The Daily Telegraph</i>:

1223
01:42:06,601 --> 01:42:08,728
"Chief of general staff resigns.

1224
01:42:08,903 --> 01:42:13,806
Colonel Dort expelled from army.
Esterhazy in flight."

1225
01:42:14,175 --> 01:42:16,075
<i>The Manchester Guardian</i>:

1226
01:42:16,244 --> 01:42:19,975
"Zola's fight for truth
vindicated at last."

1227
01:42:20,348 --> 01:42:22,509
And Dreyfus?

1228
01:42:22,683 --> 01:42:26,141
"Dreyfus case revision inevitable."

1229
01:42:36,364 --> 01:42:39,231
Truth is on the march...

1230
01:42:39,400 --> 01:42:41,994
...and nothing will stop it.

1231
01:42:57,718 --> 01:43:02,655
"The criminal code of cessation has entered
a request for revision of your court-martial.

1232
01:43:02,823 --> 01:43:06,088
You hereby cease to be subject
to penal regime."

1233
01:43:09,730 --> 01:43:14,167
The <i>Cruelesfax</i> will carry you back
to France. Sentries, dismissed.

1234
01:44:18,933 --> 01:44:23,666
- Whatever induced Esterhazy to confess?
- The money the newspaper paid him.

1235
01:44:23,838 --> 01:44:26,807
After that, no one could deny you
the right to come home.

1236
01:44:26,974 --> 01:44:28,965
What a triumph. Don't you feel...?

1237
01:44:29,143 --> 01:44:33,409
I feel neither the desire
nor the need for triumph.

1238
01:44:33,614 --> 01:44:35,104
My reward?

1239
01:44:35,282 --> 01:44:41,744
I have it. Every time I think we saved
an innocent man from a living death.

1240
01:44:41,922 --> 01:44:44,390
The thought of seeing him free...

1241
01:44:44,558 --> 01:44:48,289
...of pressing his hands in mine
for the first time...

1242
01:44:48,462 --> 01:44:50,760
...that will be reward enough.

1243
01:44:50,931 --> 01:44:53,627
But our fight is only half won.

1244
01:44:53,801 --> 01:45:00,138
We must work, my friends, work.
By speech, by pen, by action.

1245
01:45:00,307 --> 01:45:04,539
We of France, who gave the world
the boon of liberty...

1246
01:45:04,712 --> 01:45:07,943
...shall we not now give it justice?

1247
01:45:08,649 --> 01:45:12,449
Listen. The very wheels are crying:

1248
01:45:12,620 --> 01:45:15,145
"Justice, justice, justice, justice."

1249
01:45:48,255 --> 01:45:51,622
Please, Émile. It's past midnight, dear.
You've done enough.

1250
01:45:51,826 --> 01:45:57,458
What's become of my military dictionary?
You know, the big green one.

1251
01:46:02,737 --> 01:46:04,830
Why, Émile...

1252
01:46:06,407 --> 01:46:08,034
...isn't this it?

1253
01:46:10,044 --> 01:46:12,103
Why, so it is.

1254
01:46:13,214 --> 01:46:16,650
Must you drive yourself like this
day and night?

1255
01:46:16,817 --> 01:46:19,377
I must. I must, Alexandrine. I must.

1256
01:46:19,553 --> 01:46:22,579
There's so much to do
and so little time to do it.

1257
01:46:22,757 --> 01:46:24,748
I see it all clearly now:

1258
01:46:24,925 --> 01:46:28,088
The cause and the effect.
The roots and the tree.

1259
01:46:28,262 --> 01:46:31,425
- But, darling...
- Wait. Wait a minute.

1260
01:46:31,599 --> 01:46:37,936
The cause and the effect.
The roots and the tree.

1261
01:46:38,105 --> 01:46:40,073
I can use that.

1262
01:46:43,144 --> 01:46:44,736
What were you saying, my dear?

1263
01:46:44,912 --> 01:46:48,404
I said, I can't understand
all this frantic hurry.

1264
01:46:49,016 --> 01:46:54,147
- There's always tomorrow.
- Always? I wonder.

1265
01:46:54,321 --> 01:46:57,381
I wonder if in the middle
of my most important work...

1266
01:46:57,558 --> 01:46:59,423
...there will always be a tomorrow.

1267
01:46:59,593 --> 01:47:01,083
Darling, you're tired.

1268
01:47:01,262 --> 01:47:05,198
What matters the individual
if the idea survives?

1269
01:47:05,366 --> 01:47:07,197
Now, you must get some rest.

1270
01:47:07,368 --> 01:47:10,201
You have to be up early
for the Dreyfus ceremony.

1271
01:47:10,371 --> 01:47:14,740
Yes, Dreyfus. Yes, tomorrow
he will be restored to the army.

1272
01:47:14,909 --> 01:47:17,878
You know, it's a queer thing,
this Dreyfus affair.

1273
01:47:18,045 --> 01:47:23,984
Before it, I thought my work was done.
I could sit back and dream a little.

1274
01:47:24,151 --> 01:47:29,248
Cézanne was right.
I was getting smug and complacent.

1275
01:47:29,423 --> 01:47:34,156
Then suddenly came the Dreyfus explosion,
and I'm alive again...

1276
01:47:34,328 --> 01:47:36,262
...my head bursting with ideas!

1277
01:47:36,430 --> 01:47:40,093
This new book is bigger than anything
I've ever dared before.

1278
01:47:40,267 --> 01:47:42,792
The world about to hurl itself
to destruction...

1279
01:47:42,970 --> 01:47:48,909
...the will of nations for peace,
a powerful break, stopping it on the brink.

1280
01:47:49,076 --> 01:47:51,704
You don't believe it? Wait.

1281
01:47:56,217 --> 01:48:01,245
"To save Dreyfus, we had to challenge
the might of those who dominate the world.

1282
01:48:01,422 --> 01:48:03,390
It is not the swaggering militarists.

1283
01:48:03,557 --> 01:48:06,685
They're but puppets that dance
as the strings are pulled.

1284
01:48:06,861 --> 01:48:10,319
It is those others,
those who would ruthlessly plunge us...

1285
01:48:10,497 --> 01:48:14,991
...into the bloody abyss of war
to protect their power."

1286
01:48:15,169 --> 01:48:20,004
Think of it, thousands of children
sleeping peacefully tonight...

1287
01:48:20,174 --> 01:48:25,168
...under the roofs of Paris, Berlin,
London, all the world...

1288
01:48:25,346 --> 01:48:29,680
...doomed to die horribly
under some titanic battlefield...

1289
01:48:29,850 --> 01:48:34,514
...unless it can be prevented.
And it can be prevented!

1290
01:48:34,688 --> 01:48:36,588
The world must be conquered...

1291
01:48:36,757 --> 01:48:41,854
...but not by force of arms,
but by ideas that liberate.

1292
01:48:42,029 --> 01:48:45,556
Then can we build it anew.

1293
01:48:45,733 --> 01:48:49,863
Build for the humble and the wretched.

1294
01:48:51,105 --> 01:48:52,868
That's good.

1295
01:48:53,540 --> 01:48:55,770
I must remember that.

1296
01:49:00,547 --> 01:49:04,039
- Good night, my darling.
- Good night, dear.

1297
01:49:04,218 --> 01:49:05,685
There...

1298
01:49:10,057 --> 01:49:15,791
- but by ideas that liberate.

1299
01:49:16,497 --> 01:49:20,456
Then can we build.

1300
01:49:22,136 --> 01:49:26,129
Build for the humble...

1301
01:49:26,307 --> 01:49:29,572
...and the wretched.

1302
01:50:48,956 --> 01:50:52,050
"The court of revision,
having unanimously agreed...

1303
01:50:52,226 --> 01:50:56,185
...that Alfred Dreyfus was and is
innocent of the charges against him...

1304
01:50:56,363 --> 01:50:59,992
...have, in acquitting him, reversed
the verdict of the former court.

1305
01:51:00,167 --> 01:51:03,728
The French government has ordered
a proclamation of his innocence...

1306
01:51:03,904 --> 01:51:08,034
...to be posted in every French town,
in every village, in every colony.

1307
01:51:08,208 --> 01:51:11,905
And he is hereby reinstated,
promoted to the rank of commandant...

1308
01:51:12,079 --> 01:51:17,415
...and confirmed in all honors previously
held by him in the army of France."

1309
01:51:18,185 --> 01:51:21,382
Commandant Dreyfus,
in behalf of the president...

1310
01:51:21,555 --> 01:51:25,582
...the people of the republic,
and by virtue of the powers vested in me...

1311
01:51:25,759 --> 01:51:29,627
...I knight you a member
of the Legion of Honor.

1312
01:51:36,336 --> 01:51:38,770
Close the ceremony.

1313
01:52:04,264 --> 01:52:07,791
- Long live Dreyfus!
- Long live Dreyfus!

1314
01:52:08,368 --> 01:52:11,132
<i>Long live Dreyfus!</i>

1315
01:52:11,605 --> 01:52:15,564
- Congratulations, commandant.
- General Picquart, thank you.

1316
01:52:23,884 --> 01:52:27,945
- This is a proud day for France.
- My deepest congratulations.

1317
01:52:31,358 --> 01:52:33,258
Didn't Zola come?

1318
01:52:33,427 --> 01:52:36,089
Zola found dead!
Zola found dead!

1319
01:52:36,263 --> 01:52:37,890
Zola found dead!

1320
01:52:42,069 --> 01:52:43,798
"Zola dead.

1321
01:52:45,339 --> 01:52:49,332
Carbon monoxide gas
kills famous writer."

1322
01:52:55,616 --> 01:52:57,675
Let us not mourn him.

1323
01:52:57,851 --> 01:53:03,118
Let us rather salute that bright spirit of his,
which will live forever.

1324
01:53:03,290 --> 01:53:09,490
And, like a torch, enlighten a younger
generation inspired to follow him.

1325
01:53:09,730 --> 01:53:12,995
You who are enjoying
today's freedom...

1326
01:53:13,167 --> 01:53:16,000
...take to your hearts
the words of Zola.

1327
01:53:16,170 --> 01:53:19,936
Do not forget those who fought
the battles for you...

1328
01:53:20,107 --> 01:53:23,338
...and bought your liberty
with their genius and their blood.

1329
01:53:23,510 --> 01:53:29,779
Do not forget them and applaud
the lies of fanatical intolerance.

1330
01:53:31,218 --> 01:53:33,015
Be human.

1331
01:53:34,087 --> 01:53:36,453
For no man
in all the breadth of our land...

1332
01:53:36,623 --> 01:53:41,083
...more fervently loved humanity
than Zola.

1333
01:53:41,628 --> 01:53:44,961
He had the simplicity of a great soul.

1334
01:53:46,767 --> 01:53:49,964
He was enjoying the fruits
of his labor...

1335
01:53:50,571 --> 01:53:53,369
...fame, wealth, security...

1336
01:53:53,540 --> 01:53:56,509
...when suddenly,
out of his own free will...

1337
01:53:56,677 --> 01:54:00,613
...he tore himself from
all the peaceful pleasures of his life...

1338
01:54:00,781 --> 01:54:03,181
...from the work he loved so much...

1339
01:54:03,350 --> 01:54:09,220
...because he knew that there is
no serenity save in justice...

1340
01:54:09,389 --> 01:54:11,823
...no repose save in truth.

1341
01:54:12,192 --> 01:54:18,392
At the sound of his brave words,
France awakened from her sleep.

1342
01:54:19,499 --> 01:54:23,492
How admirable is the genius
of our country.

1343
01:54:23,670 --> 01:54:26,002
How beautiful the soul of France...

1344
01:54:26,173 --> 01:54:30,132
...which for centuries taught right
and justice to Europe and the world.

1345
01:54:30,310 --> 01:54:35,509
France is once again today
the land of reason and benevolence...

1346
01:54:35,682 --> 01:54:40,449
...because one of her sons, through
an immense work and a great action...

1347
01:54:40,621 --> 01:54:45,058
...gave rise to a new order of things
based on justice...

1348
01:54:45,225 --> 01:54:47,853
...and the rights common to all men.

1349
01:54:50,330 --> 01:54:54,323
Let us not pity him
because he suffered and endured.

1350
01:54:54,668 --> 01:54:56,659
Let us envy him.

1351
01:54:57,337 --> 01:55:03,833
Let us envy him because his great heart
won him the proudest of destinies.

1352
01:55:04,645 --> 01:55:09,776
He was a moment
of the conscience of man.
