1
00:01:40,602 --> 00:01:43,162
<i>I remember looking out at the two of you.</i>

2
00:01:43,237 --> 00:01:46,002
Her playing on the dock, you watching.

3
00:01:52,046 --> 00:01:57,450
I was thinking how lucky you were
to have a mom like her,

4
00:02:02,323 --> 00:02:05,259
and how lucky she was
to have a boy like you.

5
00:02:14,068 --> 00:02:16,332
That's what he stole from you, Simon.

6
00:02:19,341 --> 00:02:21,365
That's what I can never forgive.

7
00:02:24,413 --> 00:02:26,506
<i>The thing you have to remember</i>
<i>about my mother</i>

8
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:28,913
<i>was that she was extremely trusting.</i>

9
00:02:31,186 --> 00:02:34,747
<i>It's the only way she could have</i>
<i>found herself in that situation.</i>

10
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:38,783
And that was the first thing

11
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:41,728
that must have been obvious
to the security agents.

12
00:02:43,932 --> 00:02:45,763
She was completely innocent.

13
00:02:53,141 --> 00:02:55,473
- You speak Hebrew?
- No.

14
00:02:57,612 --> 00:02:59,546
You'll be staying in Tel Aviv?

15
00:03:00,414 --> 00:03:02,314
We're going to the Holy Land.

16
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,812
Who's "we"?

17
00:03:04,552 --> 00:03:06,349
My fiancé and I.

18
00:03:07,156 --> 00:03:09,181
Why isn't he traveling with you?

19
00:03:10,192 --> 00:03:12,557
He had to stay for business.

20
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,662
You're pregnant?

21
00:03:17,932 --> 00:03:20,901
People always ask
how two kids could be so different.

22
00:03:25,574 --> 00:03:28,805
Your mother showed her talent
from the time she could walk,

23
00:03:32,447 --> 00:03:33,879
even before.

24
00:03:35,584 --> 00:03:39,713
She was always singing to herself,
around the house, in the yard.

25
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:45,793
When she picked up a violin, it was like
she already knew where to put her fingers.

26
00:03:57,438 --> 00:04:02,307
Your uncle, on the other hand,
never figured out what his talent was,

27
00:04:04,012 --> 00:04:05,842
except trouble and mischief.

28
00:04:40,915 --> 00:04:44,408
<i>My parents said the most ridiculous thing.</i>
<i>But, like, you never have proof,</i>

29
00:04:44,485 --> 00:04:45,713
<i>and you just want some sort of proof.</i>

30
00:04:45,786 --> 00:04:47,084
<i>That's exactly what it was like, you know.</i>

31
00:04:47,154 --> 00:04:50,055
<i>And then it just turned out to be</i>
<i>really funny, so I wanted to show you guys.</i>

32
00:04:50,125 --> 00:04:52,923
<i>I mean, he thought that his life is, like,</i>
<i>really dramatic...</i>

33
00:04:52,995 --> 00:04:55,622
<i>I thought you were on crack</i>
<i>when you showed us that.</i>

34
00:04:55,697 --> 00:04:59,223
<i>It's, like, why would you</i>
<i>waste your time videotaping...</i>

35
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:00,461
Simon, you want to get that?

36
00:05:00,535 --> 00:05:02,059
<i>Why would Simon...</i>

37
00:05:10,612 --> 00:05:14,480
- Hi.
- That'll be $24.

38
00:05:15,651 --> 00:05:19,314
Well, can't you just put it on the tab
like you usually do?

39
00:05:20,588 --> 00:05:22,216
Sorry. Not anymore.

40
00:05:23,692 --> 00:05:27,560
- Is it less spicy than usual?
- Why didn't he want to put it on the tab?

41
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:33,656
- Go figure.
- That's what I'm trying to do.

42
00:05:34,235 --> 00:05:35,396
Well, don't.

43
00:05:42,177 --> 00:05:43,906
Check the green one there.

44
00:05:45,079 --> 00:05:48,810
See if it's dead. Good.

45
00:05:52,019 --> 00:05:55,079
You know, if we're having problems,
you should let me know.

46
00:05:55,156 --> 00:05:58,353
- Who said anything about having problems?
- With money.

47
00:05:58,427 --> 00:06:02,829
With money?
What are you going to do about it?

48
00:06:02,898 --> 00:06:04,728
- Help.
- How are you gonna help?

49
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,199
Are you gonna sell your old video games?

50
00:06:09,071 --> 00:06:11,903
You know, I could get a loan or something.

51
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:23,714
Innocence is a hard thing to describe.
It's like a scent,

52
00:06:23,785 --> 00:06:25,810
a thing which some people carry.

53
00:06:26,822 --> 00:06:28,516
And from the moment they found the bomb,

54
00:06:28,589 --> 00:06:32,355
the security officials knew
that my mother had nothing to do with it.

55
00:06:32,494 --> 00:06:34,394
My father was the wanted man.

56
00:06:35,997 --> 00:06:39,956
And when I heard the story
in the classroom last week,

57
00:06:40,034 --> 00:06:43,266
read to us in French, it all came back.

58
00:06:44,105 --> 00:06:47,939
I was raised to hate my father
for what he did to our family.

59
00:06:48,009 --> 00:06:49,375
He was a monster.

60
00:06:50,478 --> 00:06:52,572
But who exactly was this monster?

61
00:06:54,348 --> 00:06:56,180
What would make him do that?

62
00:06:56,884 --> 00:06:59,319
You have anybody meeting you in Tel Aviv?

63
00:06:59,387 --> 00:07:01,413
Yes. His family.

64
00:07:01,555 --> 00:07:04,548
- Whose family?
- My fiancé's.

65
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:08,391
- Where does his family live?
- Over there.

66
00:07:10,197 --> 00:07:13,894
- In which city?
- In Bethlehem.

67
00:07:13,968 --> 00:07:17,132
- So they live in Bethlehem?
- I think so.

68
00:07:20,042 --> 00:07:23,978
Although this occurred many years ago,

69
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:28,915
the story is often used to illustrate the

70
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:35,211
effectiveness of the Israeli
security measures.

71
00:07:39,127 --> 00:07:43,187
She was stopped, as are all passengers
traveling on the airline,

72
00:07:44,266 --> 00:07:47,064
for an interview by an agent.

73
00:07:50,872 --> 00:07:55,069
Aspects of her story seemed suspicious
to this agent,

74
00:07:55,976 --> 00:07:58,639
including the fact that her fiancé,

75
00:07:59,581 --> 00:08:05,485
the father of her unborn child,
was not traveling with her.

76
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:12,819
According to the behavioral profiles
of Israeli security,

77
00:08:14,762 --> 00:08:18,961
pregnant women seldom traveled alone...

78
00:08:33,715 --> 00:08:36,274
- Is this all the money you're carrying?
- Yes.

79
00:08:36,918 --> 00:08:39,909
- How long you plan to stay?
- Two weeks.

80
00:08:39,988 --> 00:08:43,947
- With this much money?
- His family's meeting me there.

81
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,855
And taking you to Bethlehem?

82
00:08:46,827 --> 00:08:50,957
Where you will get married
to the man you're not traveling with?

83
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:54,467
He had business. He's meeting me there.

84
00:09:12,287 --> 00:09:14,254
I just need another minute.

85
00:09:16,924 --> 00:09:20,162
- I can feel the baby kicking.
- No, you can't.

86
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:21,725
Yes, I can.

87
00:09:25,567 --> 00:09:27,466
There, it kicked again.

88
00:09:29,638 --> 00:09:31,605
I like your imagination.

89
00:09:46,721 --> 00:09:48,951
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

90
00:09:53,327 --> 00:09:55,125
Why can't you come with me?

91
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:59,725
- I told you, the ticket isn't changeable.
- Well, you changed yours.

92
00:09:59,801 --> 00:10:02,065
My boss paid to change mine.

93
00:10:03,572 --> 00:10:06,131
- He won't do it again.
- Why not?

94
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,937
It's a business decision.

95
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:12,135
- Yeah, but can't you explain?
- I've tried.

96
00:10:15,783 --> 00:10:16,977
I've tried.

97
00:10:22,157 --> 00:10:24,182
I don't want you to worry.

98
00:10:25,326 --> 00:10:29,661
They're going to treat you like a queen.
They'll take you to the hotel.

99
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:33,725
I'll be there in two days.

100
00:10:34,302 --> 00:10:35,996
- Okay.
- Okay.

101
00:10:51,586 --> 00:10:53,052
I made them myself.

102
00:10:54,422 --> 00:10:57,788
It was your grandmother's idea,
but she never lived to see it.

103
00:10:59,927 --> 00:11:01,918
She did all the drawings.

104
00:11:03,999 --> 00:11:06,558
And here's a picture of her working on them.

105
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:10,599
Mary, Joseph, the Three Wise Kings.

106
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:18,067
I still have them in a drawer somewhere.
Have I ever shown them to you?

107
00:11:18,145 --> 00:11:20,671
- No.
- Your uncle helped me.

108
00:11:22,484 --> 00:11:25,647
Tom was always good with his hands.

109
00:11:36,998 --> 00:11:38,658
That's beautiful.

110
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:48,706
Do you put it up every year?

111
00:11:54,849 --> 00:11:55,837
Yeah.

112
00:12:24,913 --> 00:12:26,539
Is this your son?

113
00:12:30,317 --> 00:12:33,287
We, too, believe that Jesus was a prophet.

114
00:12:35,557 --> 00:12:38,219
I think the Jews believe that, as well.

115
00:12:39,461 --> 00:12:42,327
- What do the Jews believe?
- That he was a prophet.

116
00:12:42,397 --> 00:12:43,886
But not the Messiah,

117
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,961
- which is why they killed him.
- Excuse me.

118
00:12:50,071 --> 00:12:51,799
This is private property.

119
00:12:54,142 --> 00:12:56,837
- The road?
- You're not on the road.

120
00:13:26,441 --> 00:13:29,604
<i>I often think about what must have been</i>
<i>going through my father's head</i>

121
00:13:29,677 --> 00:13:31,941
<i>as he talked my mother into his plan.</i>

122
00:13:34,816 --> 00:13:35,908
Did he have any feelings for her?

123
00:13:35,984 --> 00:13:38,543
Was it difficult for him to go through with?

124
00:13:39,854 --> 00:13:41,719
Or was it possible that

125
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:45,953
the only way he could talk himself
into doing it was because he loved her?

126
00:13:48,363 --> 00:13:52,924
And what about me,
the unborn child resting in her belly?

127
00:13:53,701 --> 00:13:56,067
Did I ever cross his mind?

128
00:13:56,136 --> 00:13:59,004
When I heard the story
in this classroom last week,

129
00:14:01,075 --> 00:14:04,009
all these images came flooding back to me.

130
00:14:05,212 --> 00:14:08,875
And we'll get married there.
Would you like that?

131
00:14:13,053 --> 00:14:15,113
- This is like a dream.
- What is?

132
00:14:16,557 --> 00:14:18,753
These look so beautiful on you.

133
00:14:22,096 --> 00:14:26,759
When I first told you I was pregnant,
you said you wanted nothing to do with it.

134
00:14:29,571 --> 00:14:33,597
- I was so confused.
- You said I was on my own.

135
00:14:36,977 --> 00:14:42,415
You are the greatest blessing in my life.
I didn't realize that.

136
00:14:44,052 --> 00:14:48,682
- And now you do?
- Yes. Now I do. I do. I do.

137
00:14:53,061 --> 00:14:55,927
- I will love you for always.
- For always?

138
00:14:56,029 --> 00:14:59,090
- For always.
- Forever. It's not "for always."

139
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:01,125
Forever.

140
00:15:13,815 --> 00:15:16,648
- Why didn't you say anything?
- About what?

141
00:15:16,717 --> 00:15:19,744
When she said that stuff about
the Jews killing Jesus.

142
00:15:20,922 --> 00:15:24,221
- Why should I?
- So you just ask her to leave?

143
00:15:25,025 --> 00:15:27,823
Yeah, I asked her to leave, Simon.
She was crazy.

144
00:15:27,928 --> 00:15:31,261
Look, women like that,
they don't come to this part of town, okay?

145
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:32,594
They don't walk around at night
by themselves.

146
00:15:32,667 --> 00:15:36,364
What if she moved down the street, Tom?
What if she was out taking a stroll?

147
00:15:36,437 --> 00:15:37,870
Well, then she's gonna learn
that you don't go around

148
00:15:37,938 --> 00:15:39,735
spouting that sort of crap.

149
00:15:41,042 --> 00:15:43,202
How's she gonna learn anything?

150
00:15:46,648 --> 00:15:50,981
You never engaged in a conversation
or defended a position.

151
00:15:51,052 --> 00:15:54,578
Defended a position?
I asked her to get off my property.

152
00:16:03,331 --> 00:16:05,958
So, look, Simon mentioned getting a loan.

153
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:09,230
- Against what?
- Against the house.

154
00:16:11,139 --> 00:16:13,971
Tom, he doesn't have access
to your dad's house until he turns 25.

155
00:16:14,042 --> 00:16:15,269
- You know that.
- Yeah, I know.

156
00:16:15,342 --> 00:16:19,472
- Aren't you supposed to look after it?
- Look after it?

157
00:16:19,547 --> 00:16:21,173
His stuff, his affairs.

158
00:16:21,481 --> 00:16:22,642
You're the...

159
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:24,274
- Executor.
- Yes.

160
00:16:24,985 --> 00:16:29,480
So you can't do anything to change that?
You can't help us out?

161
00:16:29,557 --> 00:16:32,081
It's locked in stone. He made sure of that.

162
00:16:33,927 --> 00:16:39,889
Look, if you need cash,
you can always sell your sister's violin.

163
00:16:41,302 --> 00:16:43,600
She left that to Simon.
That's worth a lot of money.

164
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:44,729
Right.

165
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,537
You made some choices, Tom.

166
00:16:48,076 --> 00:16:51,135
Taking over your sister's house in the city,

167
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:53,043
letting Simon grow up there,

168
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:57,544
I guess you must have thought
it was good to get away from your dad.

169
00:16:58,653 --> 00:17:00,052
But that cost you.

170
00:17:05,893 --> 00:17:06,882
Fuck it.

171
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,224
That's good.
It's a good idea to start the act with that.

172
00:17:14,301 --> 00:17:18,032
And be careful with the ladder.
No more accidents, okay?

173
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:25,539
- So, have you heard this story before?
- No.

174
00:17:26,381 --> 00:17:29,009
It just occurred to you to write it this way?

175
00:17:30,817 --> 00:17:33,945
Well, you told us to translate
as it came most naturally.

176
00:17:36,023 --> 00:17:41,723
And it came to you naturally
to imagine yourself as their son?

177
00:17:41,863 --> 00:17:44,888
Well, it just... It seemed cool.

178
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:49,692
You know, that's why I needed
a few minutes more to rewrite it.

179
00:17:50,538 --> 00:17:53,233
- From his point of view.
- Like he was my age.

180
00:17:53,307 --> 00:17:58,243
Like he was me talking about his parents.

181
00:18:04,786 --> 00:18:06,720
I want you to work on this.

182
00:18:06,788 --> 00:18:08,881
I want you to present it next week
to the class.

183
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:13,119
I want everyone to believe it's true,
that you're this couple's child.

184
00:18:13,361 --> 00:18:14,419
Why?

185
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,963
As an exercise.

186
00:18:19,267 --> 00:18:20,757
An exercise in what?

187
00:18:28,476 --> 00:18:32,572
- I'm not sure if my French is that good.
- Then do it in English.

188
00:18:33,647 --> 00:18:36,241
- But you teach French.
- And Drama.

189
00:18:36,317 --> 00:18:39,582
- I'm not in Drama.
- Well, you are now.

190
00:18:55,702 --> 00:18:57,432
Your uncle's an angry man.

191
00:18:58,772 --> 00:19:01,640
Some people think he's stupid,
but that's not true.

192
00:19:03,277 --> 00:19:07,976
When someone carries that sort of anger
around all the time, they can seem stupid.

193
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:13,946
That's the thing about anger.

194
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,215
It sucks up a lot of intelligence.

195
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:20,721
- Hey! Hey! What are you doing?
- You can't park here, man.

196
00:19:20,795 --> 00:19:22,353
So write me a ticket!

197
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,828
I don't write the tickets.
You already got a ticket.

198
00:19:23,897 --> 00:19:28,357
- It's $55 to get me to stop.
- Otherwise?

199
00:19:28,435 --> 00:19:31,132
Otherwise, I'm gonna tow
your fucking car away.

200
00:19:42,517 --> 00:19:44,484
- Lady, I promise, I'm very good at this.
- Fuck!

201
00:19:44,551 --> 00:19:46,076
I'm going to pick it up,
we're gonna get out of here,

202
00:19:46,153 --> 00:19:47,314
everything's gonna be good. It's easy...

203
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:49,252
Nothing, nothing,
nothing can happen to this car.

204
00:19:49,323 --> 00:19:51,689
Lady, I promise.
Nothing's going to happen, okay?

205
00:19:51,759 --> 00:19:54,125
Why don't you take a break? I promise.

206
00:19:54,194 --> 00:19:55,219
Yeah?

207
00:20:01,035 --> 00:20:04,299
I was driving it normally.
He said it was gonna be fine.

208
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:08,499
What do you want me to do?
It's not my fault. The car just died.

209
00:20:23,156 --> 00:20:25,785
Well, I didn't do anything. It's not my fault.

210
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:30,923
He's a fucking tow truck driver.
I didn't ask for his credentials.

211
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:42,506
Hop in the truck. I'll be two seconds.

212
00:20:42,844 --> 00:20:44,141
We good, man?

213
00:21:08,501 --> 00:21:10,766
- May I open your bag?
- Sure.

214
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,167
It's heavy.

215
00:21:25,353 --> 00:21:28,151
<i>Please do not leave your bags unattended.</i>

216
00:21:28,221 --> 00:21:29,984
What they found at the bottom
of my mother's bag

217
00:21:30,057 --> 00:21:33,048
were concealed plastic explosives
and a detonator.

218
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:38,387
And if the bomb had gone off in mid-air,
as my father intended,

219
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:43,027
all 400 people on board that flight
would have perished.

220
00:21:44,838 --> 00:21:47,307
I wouldn't be here to tell you the story.

221
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:55,478
<i>Simon is my best friend,</i>
<i>and I was really confused, too,</i>

222
00:21:55,548 --> 00:21:57,607
<i>when he was standing</i>
<i>in front of the classroom and he was talking,</i>

223
00:21:57,684 --> 00:21:58,981
<i>and I didn't know anything about it.</i>
<i>But then...</i>

224
00:21:59,052 --> 00:22:04,150
<i>You have to wake up and stop living</i>
<i>in your ignorant little box. Seriously.</i>

225
00:22:04,224 --> 00:22:07,057
<i>I am not living in an ignorant, little box.</i>

226
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,955
<i>If he didn't want to tell me about</i>
<i>something like this,</i>

227
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:10,587
<i>then there must have been a good reason.</i>

228
00:22:10,664 --> 00:22:12,826
<i>And if he doesn't want to talk to us about it,</i>

229
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,923
<i>then there's a good reason for that, too.</i>

230
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,662
<i>So I think we should all</i>
<i>just leave him alone because...</i>

231
00:22:15,736 --> 00:22:19,797
A lot of you are wondering
why I haven't told you about this before.

232
00:22:19,874 --> 00:22:24,641
The reason is, well, I've...
I only found out a few months ago myself.

233
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:29,980
I was asking my grandpa
a whole lot of questions before he died,

234
00:22:30,050 --> 00:22:31,117
and I kept this on my cell as a reminder.

235
00:22:31,117 --> 00:22:36,714
and I kept this on my cell as a reminder.

236
00:22:39,826 --> 00:22:42,057
<i>You have to believe me, Simon.</i>

237
00:22:44,332 --> 00:22:46,060
<i>Your father was a killer.</i>

238
00:22:47,567 --> 00:22:50,434
<i>If the bomb had gone off in mid-air,</i>
<i>as my father intended,</i>

239
00:22:51,005 --> 00:22:54,098
it would have been the most devastating
terrorist attack of its time

240
00:22:54,174 --> 00:22:57,633
and my father would have gone down
in history as a mass-murderer.

241
00:22:58,546 --> 00:23:03,142
Except he wouldn't have gone down
as my father.

242
00:23:03,317 --> 00:23:05,443
I would have disappeared
in my mother's womb,

243
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:08,646
along with all the other passengers
on board that flight.

244
00:23:10,958 --> 00:23:13,017
I wouldn't be here to tell you the story.

245
00:23:15,695 --> 00:23:16,788
How's that?

246
00:23:16,864 --> 00:23:19,127
Have you told anyone else about this?

247
00:23:19,666 --> 00:23:23,568
- That I'm making it up? No.
- Why not?

248
00:23:24,305 --> 00:23:28,173
If my friends found out it wasn't true,
it wouldn't be the same.

249
00:23:29,442 --> 00:23:31,740
What wouldn't be the same?

250
00:23:31,811 --> 00:23:36,510
The feeling I get when I'm performing.

251
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:41,846
I mean, some parts of it
could almost be true,

252
00:23:43,391 --> 00:23:45,882
- but in a different way.
- In what way?

253
00:23:48,128 --> 00:23:51,394
Things about my family.

254
00:23:51,464 --> 00:23:54,957
Stuff... Stuff I haven't thought about
for a while.

255
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:05,240
So, your father planted a bomb
on your mother?

256
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:07,271
No.

257
00:24:09,383 --> 00:24:13,217
Well, sort of.

258
00:24:19,993 --> 00:24:22,861
- You live with your uncle?
- Yeah.

259
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:25,228
Does he know about this project?

260
00:24:29,202 --> 00:24:33,798
- Are you going to tell him?
- I don't think he'd get it.

261
00:24:33,874 --> 00:24:36,035
He wasn't really raised to be tolerant
about this sort of thing,

262
00:24:36,109 --> 00:24:40,773
and his dad, my grandfather, he was...
He was a bit of a hard-ass.

263
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:46,353
- That could change.
- He died last spring.

264
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,148
Your uncle.

265
00:24:48,221 --> 00:24:50,747
He might be more open-minded
than you think.

266
00:24:51,892 --> 00:24:53,519
I wouldn't bet on that.

267
00:24:54,862 --> 00:24:59,195
Well, there is a way to find out.

268
00:25:18,652 --> 00:25:21,644
I came to apologize for yesterday.

269
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:27,087
That was wrong of me,
to embarrass a father in front of his son.

270
00:25:28,162 --> 00:25:29,492
Okay.

271
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:34,462
Is he here? Your boy?

272
00:25:35,802 --> 00:25:38,169
He's in his bedroom doing his homework.

273
00:25:39,573 --> 00:25:42,336
I wanted to explain
something I said yesterday.

274
00:25:48,015 --> 00:25:50,608
It will only take a minute of your time.

275
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:01,853
All right. Why don't you come in?

276
00:26:26,686 --> 00:26:29,315
So why did you come to this part of the city?

277
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:34,521
I was just driving around
and I saw your decorations.

278
00:26:35,195 --> 00:26:37,663
You were just driving around on your own?

279
00:26:39,866 --> 00:26:41,356
I do that sometimes.

280
00:26:42,169 --> 00:26:47,505
When I saw this public display of your faith,
it touched me.

281
00:26:49,809 --> 00:26:51,003
Why?

282
00:26:53,314 --> 00:26:55,748
I feel people staring at me all the time,

283
00:26:57,284 --> 00:27:02,778
wondering why I would make
such a visible statement of my belief.

284
00:27:04,191 --> 00:27:07,023
Where I come from, it's completely natural.

285
00:27:08,528 --> 00:27:12,089
Here, it threatens.

286
00:27:12,165 --> 00:27:14,827
And that surprises you?

287
00:27:14,902 --> 00:27:16,061
Yes.

288
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:19,162
Like a woman in a bikini
wouldn't threaten you people?

289
00:27:21,407 --> 00:27:23,307
Us people?

290
00:27:27,381 --> 00:27:30,248
Maybe people really should
stick to their own kind.

291
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:35,911
- That's how you were raised?
- Yeah, I was.

292
00:27:36,557 --> 00:27:40,288
- And you're okay with that?
- Yeah, I'm just fine with it.

293
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,939
- Who is this?
- It's my sister.

294
00:28:12,358 --> 00:28:13,723
She's a musician?

295
00:28:14,627 --> 00:28:17,028
Yeah, she was. She died a few years ago.

296
00:28:17,765 --> 00:28:20,928
I'm sorry. How did she die?

297
00:28:21,835 --> 00:28:23,564
Car accident.

298
00:28:24,238 --> 00:28:25,261
Alone?

299
00:28:26,006 --> 00:28:29,498
- Excuse me?
- Was she alone in the car?

300
00:28:31,545 --> 00:28:33,273
No. The driver died, too.

301
00:28:35,782 --> 00:28:37,147
Was he a friend?

302
00:28:39,586 --> 00:28:43,545
Look, you said there was something
you wanted to explain about yesterday.

303
00:28:44,857 --> 00:28:48,316
- It was about your son.
- Well, he's not my son. He's my nephew.

304
00:28:48,528 --> 00:28:50,655
I raised him after my sister died.

305
00:28:55,501 --> 00:29:00,132
I'm sorry I used the word "Jew"
yesterday. That's not what I meant.

306
00:29:00,207 --> 00:29:02,767
The problem is not with the Jews and Christ.

307
00:29:02,843 --> 00:29:04,470
It's with the Zionists.

308
00:29:06,346 --> 00:29:08,872
Thank you. Thank you for making that clear.

309
00:29:10,317 --> 00:29:12,285
Are you making fun of me?

310
00:29:12,353 --> 00:29:17,346
Listen, your issues with Jews or Zionists
or whoever you happen to hate,

311
00:29:18,525 --> 00:29:21,824
they have nothing to do with my life
or Simon's.

312
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:25,830
- That's how you were raised.
- Yes. That's exactly how I was raised.

313
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:34,605
<i>What must have been going through</i>
<i>my mother's mind as she sat in that room?</i>

314
00:29:34,674 --> 00:29:39,338
<i>And at that point, she couldn't have been</i>
<i>aware of the monstrosity of the betrayal,</i>

315
00:29:39,413 --> 00:29:42,382
or what has come to be perceived
as a monstrosity.

316
00:29:45,451 --> 00:29:48,478
You know, when he first found out
what had happened,

317
00:29:48,555 --> 00:29:52,752
that she was pregnant with me,
he didn't want anything to do with it.

318
00:29:52,826 --> 00:29:56,261
He tried to convince her to abort me.

319
00:29:56,329 --> 00:29:59,628
My mother must have been crushed by this.

320
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:06,127
But then, a few weeks later,
he showed up to declare his love for her.

321
00:30:07,307 --> 00:30:09,104
I want you to come with me.

322
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:18,316
Rachel, I told you before.
I'll be there in a few days,

323
00:30:18,384 --> 00:30:21,718
- and my family will meet you there.
- They'll be upset.

324
00:30:23,523 --> 00:30:26,652
- Why?
- I'm pregnant.

325
00:30:26,727 --> 00:30:27,954
No, no. No.

326
00:30:32,098 --> 00:30:37,263
A child is cause for great celebration
and joy.

327
00:30:37,336 --> 00:30:39,134
They'll love you even more.

328
00:30:44,711 --> 00:30:48,646
<i>I can feel sorry for him,</i>
<i>but I can't feel any amount of respect or...</i>

329
00:30:48,714 --> 00:30:50,773
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>...try to humanize anything he did.</i>

330
00:30:50,851 --> 00:30:54,251
<i>I can only say, "Wow!</i>
<i>That kind of sucks that he was raised</i>

331
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:56,380
<i>"and he grew up</i>
<i>and he thought that he had to do this</i>

332
00:30:56,457 --> 00:30:57,445
<i>- "to be enlightened."</i>
<i>- Exactly. It's been</i>

333
00:30:57,523 --> 00:31:01,550
<i>- implanted in his mind since the beginning.</i>
<i>- Or whatever he was thinking.</i>

334
00:31:01,627 --> 00:31:02,720
<i>So that's the only way he knows to live.</i>

335
00:31:02,796 --> 00:31:05,959
<i>So many things have been implanted</i>
<i>into all of our minds.</i>

336
00:31:06,032 --> 00:31:08,557
<i>You know? Like, where did I buy this?</i>

337
00:31:08,634 --> 00:31:14,335
<i>It's implanted in my mind to, like,</i>
<i>go get a good deal at, like, Nike and...</i>

338
00:31:14,441 --> 00:31:17,103
<i>Exactly, which is our culture,</i>
<i>yeah, and that's...</i>

339
00:31:17,176 --> 00:31:19,111
<i>I'm not trying to defend myself.</i>

340
00:31:19,179 --> 00:31:22,944
<i>I'm saying that</i>
<i>that stuff is ingrained in our brain,</i>

341
00:31:23,016 --> 00:31:26,747
<i>just like, you know,</i>
<i>blowing up stuff is ingrained in their brain.</i>

342
00:31:26,819 --> 00:31:29,686
<i>- Exactly, but when it hurts other people...</i>
<i>- And it does hurt other people.</i>

343
00:31:29,756 --> 00:31:31,246
<i>...I mean, but to a far higher degree.</i>

344
00:31:31,325 --> 00:31:32,519
<i>Is that something that our culture does?</i>

345
00:31:32,593 --> 00:31:36,996
<i>Yeah. So, to a far less degree,</i>
<i>we're harming someone, I suppose.</i>

346
00:31:37,064 --> 00:31:38,361
<i>No. Because we're doing it in...</i>

347
00:31:38,432 --> 00:31:40,695
<i>Why are we talking about capitalism</i>
<i>versus terrorism?</i>

348
00:31:40,767 --> 00:31:43,599
<i>- I don't know.</i>
<i>- Well, it's just like...</i>

349
00:31:43,670 --> 00:31:49,801
<i>I'm just saying that our minds are ingrained</i>
<i>with different values</i>

350
00:31:49,876 --> 00:31:55,644
<i>that also may be wrong values,</i>
<i>even though you don't even realize it.</i>

351
00:31:55,715 --> 00:32:00,414
<i>Right, but it's not blowing up 400 people</i>
<i>when I go and buy a hoodie.</i>

352
00:32:00,487 --> 00:32:02,182
<i>No, it's all for personal gain.</i>

353
00:32:02,256 --> 00:32:04,884
<i>We buy Nike because we think</i>
<i>we're gonna look cool.</i>

354
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:06,016
<i>He wanted to blow up the plane</i>

355
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:08,560
<i>'cause he thought he was going to get</i>
<i>40 virgins in the afterlife.</i>

356
00:32:08,628 --> 00:32:09,653
<i>Exactly!</i>

357
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:13,426
<i>Simon's trying to humanize him.</i>
<i>That's fine, he's his father.</i>

358
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,333
<i>Like, I would, too,</i>
<i>if I was making up a story about my father.</i>

359
00:32:16,403 --> 00:32:19,963
<i>I would try and humanize him. Like,</i>
<i>I would try... That's all part of the game.</i>

360
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:23,669
<i>We're all victims of our circumstances,</i>
<i>then that's the norm.</i>

361
00:32:23,743 --> 00:32:27,612
<i>So there's nothing out of the ordinary</i>
<i>about how the father was raised.</i>

362
00:32:27,681 --> 00:32:29,239
<i>We're all innocent to some degree.</i>

363
00:32:29,316 --> 00:32:34,048
<i>Is it any worse for us to be</i>
<i>so over-indulgent and to let people die</i>

364
00:32:34,121 --> 00:32:35,122
<i>because they have no money</i>
<i>than, like, actually killing them ourselves?</i>

365
00:32:35,122 --> 00:32:38,022
<i>because they have no money</i>
<i>than, like, actually killing them ourselves?</i>

366
00:32:38,692 --> 00:32:41,661
<i>Does that mean</i>
<i>that we should have no opinion</i>

367
00:32:41,728 --> 00:32:47,222
<i>- on terrorists killing innocent people?</i>
<i>- I'm just saying are we that much better?</i>

368
00:32:47,433 --> 00:32:51,164
<i>Of course, we're much better!</i>
<i>Of course we are.</i>

369
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:55,934
<i>Hey, guys. You've got to check this out.</i>
<i>You know how my mom's a prof?</i>

370
00:32:56,009 --> 00:32:59,307
<i>She's got this chat room</i>
<i>and they're talking all about Simon's story.</i>

371
00:32:59,378 --> 00:33:01,175
What do you mean?

372
00:33:01,248 --> 00:33:03,682
<i>They're talking about what happened</i>
<i>with your dad and everything.</i>

373
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:05,240
How'd they find out?

374
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:08,682
<i>Well, I told it to my mom.</i>

375
00:33:08,755 --> 00:33:10,882
- You showed it to your mom?
<i>- Why not?</i>

376
00:33:10,958 --> 00:33:13,653
<i>It's not like you're trying</i>
<i>to keep it a big secret anymore.</i>

377
00:33:13,727 --> 00:33:16,752
<i>I mean, why wouldn't you want people</i>
<i>to find out?</i>

378
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:21,563
<i>Why is that so shocking,</i>
<i>so surprising to you that you feel</i>

379
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:25,001
<i>that you have a sense of entitlement</i>
<i>in this story?</i>

380
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:29,667
<i>I was on that plane. I was on that plane.</i>
<i>I don't call it a sense of entitlement.</i>

381
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:33,439
<i>It happens to be that...</i>
<i>If it is evil, whatever it was,</i>

382
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:37,449
<i>whatever Simon's father's intentions were,</i>

383
00:33:37,517 --> 00:33:43,944
<i>I could feel on my own skin</i>
<i>once I learned about it.</i>

384
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:50,486
<i>I'm not sure that it was a trauma at the time.</i>
<i>I think we're just living it in our minds</i>

385
00:33:50,564 --> 00:33:52,827
<i>the way Simon is trying to live it in his mind.</i>

386
00:33:52,898 --> 00:33:54,866
<i>Yes. I think that the trauma happens later on,</i>

387
00:33:54,934 --> 00:33:58,165
<i>that it grows on you as time goes by,</i>
<i>almost like a cancer.</i>

388
00:33:58,305 --> 00:34:00,034
<i>Whether it's real or fictional,</i>

389
00:34:00,106 --> 00:34:03,736
<i>as soon as we imagine it, then it becomes</i>
<i>something that we have to deal with.</i>

390
00:34:03,809 --> 00:34:07,746
<i>I don't understand what's so seductive</i>
<i>about being a victim.</i>

391
00:34:07,814 --> 00:34:09,974
<i>We embrace the sense of being a victim</i>

392
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:14,418
<i>almost to the extent that it blinds us</i>
<i>to the pain of others.</i>

393
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:17,820
<i>It's like a suit of clothes</i>
<i>that's so comfortable today.</i>

394
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:20,257
<i>His father basically ruined my life.</i>

395
00:34:20,327 --> 00:34:23,159
<i>I mean, I've been pretty much...</i>

396
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,994
<i>Since, you know... And...</i>

397
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,960
<i>Since it happened, I've been pretty much...</i>

398
00:34:30,036 --> 00:34:34,804
<i>My eating is completely out of control.</i>
<i>Has been. I've gained about 100 pounds.</i>

399
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:40,403
<i>And I just can't...</i>
<i>I can't seem to get it together</i>

400
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,472
<i>to just basically do anything.</i>

401
00:34:43,550 --> 00:34:48,418
<i>So when I do work, I have to travel by plane,</i>
<i>it basically goes like this.</i>

402
00:34:48,487 --> 00:34:53,117
<i>Like, one second after another second,</i>
<i>it's like, "Is it going to explode?</i>

403
00:34:53,193 --> 00:34:55,353
<i>"Is it going to explode?</i>
<i>Is it going to explode?"</i>

404
00:34:55,429 --> 00:34:57,693
<i>Second after second after second.</i>

405
00:34:57,764 --> 00:34:59,755
<i>"Is it going to explode?</i>
<i>Is it going to explode?"</i>

406
00:34:59,833 --> 00:35:02,324
<i>The next second, "Is it going to explode?"</i>

407
00:35:02,835 --> 00:35:06,327
<i>- It's like that. I mean, you know...</i>
<i>- I've known David for 25 years,</i>

408
00:35:06,405 --> 00:35:11,969
<i>and he's just a different man. Like, he's just</i>
<i>not the same person that he used to be.</i>

409
00:35:12,045 --> 00:35:15,445
<i>It's not like I was such a great person</i>
<i>to begin with,</i>

410
00:35:15,514 --> 00:35:20,679
<i>but I think that I am the guy</i>
<i>who was blown to smithereens.</i>

411
00:35:20,753 --> 00:35:22,516
<i>- What?</i>
<i>- Okay? In a terrorist attack.</i>

412
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:28,322
<i>And I've come back from the dead</i>
<i>to rage against the fucking assholes</i>

413
00:35:28,394 --> 00:35:33,697
<i>who believe that killing someone</i>
<i>for an idea is something that's viable!</i>

414
00:35:33,766 --> 00:35:38,226
<i>The idea that somebody</i>
<i>would put their pregnant wife on a plane...</i>

415
00:35:38,304 --> 00:35:43,106
<i>...would choose, because I'm Jewish</i>
<i>or because the plane was going to Israel,</i>

416
00:35:43,175 --> 00:35:46,304
<i>to kill everyone on the flight,</i>
<i>I mean, that's the most sickening,</i>

417
00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:49,041
<i>disgusting, despicable thing</i>
<i>I've ever heard of in my life.</i>

418
00:35:49,115 --> 00:35:51,744
<i>But you weren't, in fact,</i>
<i>blown to smithereens.</i>

419
00:35:51,818 --> 00:35:55,083
<i>- I don't understand why you say...</i>
<i>- Did you hear what I said?</i>

420
00:35:55,155 --> 00:35:58,282
<i>"I am the guy</i>
<i>who came back from the dead!"</i>

421
00:35:58,358 --> 00:36:00,293
<i>I am speaking for them.</i>

422
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:05,692
The school's position is that you
encouraged him to take it as far as he could.

423
00:36:05,766 --> 00:36:09,634
- As a drama exercise.
- But he wasn't in the Drama Club.

424
00:36:09,702 --> 00:36:11,932
You weren't teaching him drama.

425
00:36:12,005 --> 00:36:15,668
This monologue was presented
in your French class. Is that correct?

426
00:36:17,577 --> 00:36:19,237
I don't understand, Sabine.

427
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:22,007
You convinced this boy
to present it as the truth.

428
00:36:22,081 --> 00:36:24,572
As a way of developing it.

429
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:28,108
I just did not understand it would go
as far as it did.

430
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:32,588
He never told me
he was going to post it on the Net.

431
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:36,452
I don't know how we'd proceed with this,
Sabine.

432
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:39,054
You're saying that it's wrongful dismissal,

433
00:36:39,632 --> 00:36:44,797
and yet everything the school
is claiming you did, you did.

434
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:47,532
Well, whether or not you knew
he was going to post it

435
00:36:47,606 --> 00:36:51,007
and that it would get such a reaction
is not really the issue.

436
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:54,806
No, I just don't want to waste your money.

437
00:37:05,525 --> 00:37:09,518
Why did you choose to read
that particular article to the students,

438
00:37:09,596 --> 00:37:11,893
about the man
wanting to blow up the plane?

439
00:37:11,965 --> 00:37:17,766
It's a challenging piece to translate.
It happened the month I came here.

440
00:37:18,938 --> 00:37:21,601
Why?

441
00:37:21,675 --> 00:37:24,735
My parents were killed in Beirut.

442
00:37:24,811 --> 00:37:27,177
We couldn't stay there.

443
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:29,510
No. I meant why is it so challenging?

444
00:37:45,731 --> 00:37:48,291
No. I have to go.

445
00:37:54,673 --> 00:37:57,438
Yeah. This is a tow-away zone,
employee parking.

446
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,637
You'll have to pay his release fee.

447
00:38:03,016 --> 00:38:04,677
Is this your car?

448
00:38:11,992 --> 00:38:14,688
- Yes.
- Okay. It's $55.

449
00:38:16,228 --> 00:38:19,664
- What for?
- To get me to stop.

450
00:38:19,733 --> 00:38:22,201
And if I don't want you to stop?

451
00:38:23,836 --> 00:38:28,467
- What do you mean?
- If I want you to keep doing your job.

452
00:38:28,541 --> 00:38:31,510
- Yeah, my job's to tow your car away.
- Yeah.

453
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:37,648
- I understand.
- You understand? You're sure?

454
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:41,717
I'm serious. I'm going to tow it away.

455
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:48,648
- Hey!
- Hey. Hey, hey, hey. This is your car, right?

456
00:38:50,429 --> 00:38:53,126
- Yes.
- Yeah? All right. Hold on. Hold on.

457
00:38:57,737 --> 00:39:00,001
You change your mind, give me a call.

458
00:39:52,592 --> 00:39:54,583
- Can I see?
- Yeah.

459
00:39:58,164 --> 00:40:00,358
- Can I put it up now?
- Yeah.

460
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:01,525
Thank you.

461
00:40:04,871 --> 00:40:07,135
- Should we make one of Daddy?
- Yeah.

462
00:41:15,574 --> 00:41:19,510
- Yeah?
- It's me. I'm behind you in the taxi.

463
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:22,480
- Why?
- Where are you taking my car?

464
00:41:22,916 --> 00:41:25,282
- I'm taking it to a lot.
- Is it far away?

465
00:41:25,617 --> 00:41:27,380
No. It's a few minutes from here.

466
00:41:27,454 --> 00:41:29,182
Is there one further away?

467
00:41:29,389 --> 00:41:32,016
Yeah. I can go south to Lakeshore.

468
00:41:32,092 --> 00:41:35,117
Well, I want you to take it
to the one furthest away.

469
00:41:35,594 --> 00:41:38,427
- Any reason?
- I need time.

470
00:41:39,264 --> 00:41:40,289
Time for what?

471
00:41:40,666 --> 00:41:45,103
To think. Please. Just keep driving.

472
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,105
Whatever you want.
But it's going to cost you.

473
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:50,039
That's okay. I'll pay whatever it costs.

474
00:42:08,193 --> 00:42:11,594
- Do you know this guy?
- No.

475
00:42:13,099 --> 00:42:17,661
- So, what's this about?
- Just keep driving.

476
00:42:24,677 --> 00:42:26,110
My mother would have had no idea

477
00:42:26,179 --> 00:42:28,976
of the political situation
she was entering into.

478
00:42:29,681 --> 00:42:34,016
She would have no idea that Bethlehem
at that time was under Israeli control.

479
00:42:34,954 --> 00:42:39,186
My father was giving her no sense
of the violence that had marked that region,

480
00:42:39,726 --> 00:42:41,523
the history of persecution.

481
00:42:43,463 --> 00:42:50,425
My father wanted nothing more than justice,
any sort of justice for his rage,

482
00:42:52,472 --> 00:42:58,206
and he was prepared to sacrifice
the two of us for this noble cause.

483
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:01,711
<i>You know,</i>
<i>most people have seen this action</i>

484
00:43:01,780 --> 00:43:04,579
as the most horrifying and cynical thing

485
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:07,552
that a father and husband could inflict
on a family.

486
00:43:08,521 --> 00:43:13,822
And I've come to understand
that it is not the fact.

487
00:43:16,528 --> 00:43:18,291
My father was giving us a gift.

488
00:43:18,364 --> 00:43:20,059
<i>- Wow!</i>
<i>- Simon, if you want to think that's a gift,</i>

489
00:43:20,132 --> 00:43:22,795
<i>you go right ahead,</i>
<i>but I think that's cowardly.</i>

490
00:43:22,869 --> 00:43:25,769
<i>He has a point. He does have a point.</i>
<i>I believe that he has a point.</i>

491
00:43:25,838 --> 00:43:29,967
<i>If he had given you that gift,</i>
<i>you wouldn't be here to say it was a gift.</i>

492
00:43:30,043 --> 00:43:32,476
<i>What? Hannah, you don't think people</i>
<i>can die for a cause?</i>

493
00:43:32,545 --> 00:43:35,105
<i>People can die for a cause, that's fine,</i>
<i>but don't sacrifice other people.</i>

494
00:43:35,181 --> 00:43:37,206
<i>You do not believe that</i>
<i>there is such a thing as a martyr.</i>

495
00:43:37,282 --> 00:43:39,079
<i>How would the wife have been a martyr?</i>

496
00:43:39,152 --> 00:43:41,347
<i>She didn't know what she was dying...</i>
<i>What she was going to die for.</i>

497
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:43,480
<i>He was doing it</i>
<i>because he believed in something.</i>

498
00:43:43,556 --> 00:43:45,581
<i>Yeah, but he didn't die. He wasn't...</i>

499
00:43:45,657 --> 00:43:50,652
<i>He was doing something to better the world!</i>
<i>He was doing something to better the world!</i>

500
00:43:50,730 --> 00:43:52,391
<i>And, you know,</i>
<i>he has a point when he does that.</i>

501
00:43:52,465 --> 00:43:58,130
<i>I understand your need to, sort of, think</i>
<i>of your father as someone giving a gift,</i>

502
00:43:58,204 --> 00:44:01,934
<i>but I really can't see how</i>
<i>there's any kind of justification</i>

503
00:44:02,041 --> 00:44:04,304
<i>in that much murder</i>
<i>and that much destruction.</i>

504
00:44:04,376 --> 00:44:07,505
<i>And who's on that plane?</i>
<i>Probably people like us.</i>

505
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:10,708
<i>It's not gonna be people</i>
<i>who are making big political decisions.</i>

506
00:44:10,782 --> 00:44:12,443
<i>Hundreds of other lives...</i>

507
00:44:12,518 --> 00:44:16,385
<i>I'm Daniel, and I heard about</i>
<i>your chat room through a colleague of mine</i>

508
00:44:16,456 --> 00:44:18,150
<i>whose daughter goes to your school.</i>

509
00:44:18,224 --> 00:44:22,320
<i>Now, why did Simon's father</i>
<i>not board the plane himself?</i>

510
00:44:22,394 --> 00:44:24,885
<i>You've acknowledged the possibility</i>
<i>that the man is a coward.</i>

511
00:44:24,963 --> 00:44:28,456
<i>You've acknowledged the possibility</i>
<i>that the man is a monster.</i>

512
00:44:28,534 --> 00:44:33,266
<i>Is it possible that this man just</i>
<i>and quite simply</i>

513
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:36,570
<i>wanted to view the consequences</i>
<i>of his actions?</i>

514
00:44:36,643 --> 00:44:41,706
<i>You cannot underestimate the deep,</i>
<i>earthly satisfaction</i>

515
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:45,181
<i>of viewing work you've done</i>
<i>while you are still alive.</i>

516
00:44:45,518 --> 00:44:47,509
<i>It was a heinous crime!</i>

517
00:44:49,655 --> 00:44:52,146
<i>The truth is that I don't think that</i>
<i>whatever happened to Simon's parents,</i>

518
00:44:52,224 --> 00:44:56,355
<i>it's not about concepts and an ideology</i>
<i>and who's a martyr.</i>

519
00:44:56,429 --> 00:44:59,956
<i>This is about that this happened</i>
<i>to his mother.</i>

520
00:45:00,032 --> 00:45:02,228
<i>So why don't you all just shut up?</i>
<i>'Cause why don't you just imagine</i>

521
00:45:02,302 --> 00:45:04,327
<i>what it would be like to be his mother?</i>

522
00:45:04,403 --> 00:45:06,998
<i>You're pregnant and you think</i>
<i>that you have this wonderful husband</i>

523
00:45:07,072 --> 00:45:10,809
<i>who loves you and then he's planning</i>
<i>on killing you and 400 other people.</i>

524
00:45:11,443 --> 00:45:15,574
His parents were killed in a car accident,
Sabine, eight years ago.

525
00:45:15,648 --> 00:45:18,445
They crashed into an oncoming vehicle.

526
00:45:18,518 --> 00:45:23,114
Well, this would have happened
long before that, before he was born.

527
00:45:24,257 --> 00:45:27,021
Would have. So he is lying.

528
00:45:27,092 --> 00:45:30,186
He's making it up for the play he's writing.

529
00:45:30,262 --> 00:45:34,722
Look, I know all about his parents.
I know all the details about the accident.

530
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,327
What are you? Are you an inspector?
You read the police reports?

531
00:45:38,971 --> 00:45:44,306
Well, that's what he's exploring
with this monologue.

532
00:45:44,376 --> 00:45:46,311
And you want me to approve it?

533
00:45:46,846 --> 00:45:49,815
I want you to be aware of what we are doing.

534
00:45:49,882 --> 00:45:51,076
Why?

535
00:45:52,784 --> 00:45:55,878
Because I would like to present it
at the Drama Festival.

536
00:45:55,954 --> 00:45:57,980
No. Absolutely not. No.

537
00:45:59,324 --> 00:46:02,590
You know, I have no problem with him
writing whatever he wants,

538
00:46:02,661 --> 00:46:04,219
as long as it doesn't promote hatred

539
00:46:04,297 --> 00:46:07,755
and as long as everyone knows
that it is fiction,

540
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:09,630
<i>that he's making it up.</i>

541
00:46:10,802 --> 00:46:14,670
- I put this into my pocket by accident.
- By accident?

542
00:46:15,474 --> 00:46:18,170
You know, I thought the idea
was to test my uncle's tolerance,

543
00:46:18,244 --> 00:46:19,905
not to steal things.

544
00:46:19,978 --> 00:46:22,106
Listen, I talked to the principal.

545
00:46:23,583 --> 00:46:26,313
<i>He wants people to know</i>
<i>that you're making this up.</i>

546
00:46:26,385 --> 00:46:29,047
<i>Why? That's what makes it so interesting.</i>

547
00:46:29,121 --> 00:46:32,318
It's the only way he'll let you
present it at the Drama Festival.

548
00:46:32,391 --> 00:46:34,655
So let's wait until then.

549
00:46:36,027 --> 00:46:38,086
I don't think that's a good idea.

550
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:41,759
I do.

551
00:46:47,072 --> 00:46:48,938
Keep it.

552
00:47:07,126 --> 00:47:08,753
- Yeah?
- Hi. It's me again.

553
00:47:08,827 --> 00:47:11,762
- I was wondering, have you had lunch?
- Excuse me?

554
00:47:11,831 --> 00:47:14,822
- I was wondering if you had lunch.
- No.

555
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:18,632
- Well, what if I invite you out?
- For what?

556
00:47:18,704 --> 00:47:20,934
For lunch.

557
00:47:21,007 --> 00:47:24,101
- Lady...
- Sabine. My name is Sabine.

558
00:47:24,177 --> 00:47:27,737
- Yeah, look...
- Is there a place you would like to go?

559
00:47:27,813 --> 00:47:31,943
- Look, I'm a busy guy.
- Yeah? What makes you so busy?

560
00:47:33,452 --> 00:47:36,786
- Lady, I got a lunch right here.
- So keep it for tomorrow.

561
00:47:36,856 --> 00:47:42,054
- Hold on. Sir, have you had lunch?
- No.

562
00:47:42,128 --> 00:47:45,358
- Are you hungry?
- I could eat.

563
00:48:01,614 --> 00:48:03,411
He seems to be enjoying it.

564
00:48:07,619 --> 00:48:08,847
Yeah, he does.

565
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:14,025
Does your wife pack your lunch every day?

566
00:48:15,561 --> 00:48:18,791
- No. I make it myself.
- You're not married?

567
00:48:18,864 --> 00:48:23,858
No. I got into the habit
when I had to make lunch for my kid.

568
00:48:24,670 --> 00:48:26,297
You were married?

569
00:48:27,806 --> 00:48:32,005
No. No, no, no. My nephew, my sister's kid.

570
00:48:33,112 --> 00:48:34,943
I raised him after she died.

571
00:48:37,349 --> 00:48:41,753
- Is the father around?
- No. They died together.

572
00:48:42,755 --> 00:48:44,222
It was an accident.

573
00:48:47,492 --> 00:48:49,960
How old were you?

574
00:48:50,028 --> 00:48:52,724
How old was I? I was 22.

575
00:48:54,065 --> 00:48:55,123
Thank you.

576
00:48:59,838 --> 00:49:03,570
That's a lot of responsibility,
raising a child at that age.

577
00:49:03,643 --> 00:49:07,340
- Yeah, I guess so.
- She must have trusted you.

578
00:49:17,889 --> 00:49:23,987
And now you put up decorations
as a way of remembering her.

579
00:49:31,637 --> 00:49:34,572
I'm sorry. It was a very stupid thing to do.

580
00:49:38,911 --> 00:49:42,847
- Who are you?
- Simon's teacher, French and Drama.

581
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:47,617
- You're the one that was fired?
- That's right.

582
00:49:47,686 --> 00:49:50,554
I was coming out of my lawyer's office
when we met.

583
00:49:53,458 --> 00:49:55,688
Do they know about that?

584
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:57,922
Do they know that you came to my house
and stole that?

585
00:49:57,996 --> 00:50:00,396
No. I'm sorry.

586
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:04,701
- Does Simon know?
- That it was me?

587
00:50:04,769 --> 00:50:06,670
Of course.

588
00:50:06,739 --> 00:50:08,365
We planned it together.

589
00:50:13,079 --> 00:50:18,311
He doesn't think you're very open-minded.
I wanted to prove that you were.

590
00:50:20,219 --> 00:50:23,016
It was important for the play
he wanted to write.

591
00:50:23,956 --> 00:50:25,650
- Lady...
- I thought it would do him good and...

592
00:50:25,724 --> 00:50:29,922
You're fucked up. You're fucked up.
You did that.

593
00:50:31,563 --> 00:50:36,092
You got him to post that stuff about his dad
being a terrorist. You did that?

594
00:50:36,168 --> 00:50:38,568
I had absolutely no idea
he would go that far.

595
00:50:38,637 --> 00:50:41,606
- Well, he took it that far.
- Yes, I know.

596
00:50:41,673 --> 00:50:45,132
And I'm very sorry about it,
but it was not my intention.

597
00:50:46,411 --> 00:50:47,436
Please.

598
00:50:48,813 --> 00:50:51,304
Do you know what you've done to that kid?

599
00:50:51,817 --> 00:50:54,478
- I wouldn't have let him...
- Do you know?

600
00:50:56,722 --> 00:51:01,090
Mary, Joseph, baby Jesus.

601
00:51:06,666 --> 00:51:10,362
It was your grandmother's idea,
but she never lived to see it.

602
00:51:10,436 --> 00:51:12,427
She loved Christmas.

603
00:51:14,172 --> 00:51:15,902
Didn't she, Tommy?

604
00:51:18,443 --> 00:51:20,036
Didn't she what?

605
00:51:20,545 --> 00:51:24,380
I was just telling Simon
how much your mom loved Christmas.

606
00:51:25,818 --> 00:51:29,481
- According to who, Dad?
- Don't you remember?

607
00:51:30,523 --> 00:51:31,956
No.

608
00:51:32,224 --> 00:51:36,057
What I remember, Dad,
is Christmas wasn't such a great time

609
00:51:36,128 --> 00:51:38,925
'cause it meant we had to
spend more time with you.

610
00:51:40,298 --> 00:51:43,028
Actually, we all kind of hated Christmas.

611
00:51:43,101 --> 00:51:45,262
Don't you believe him.

612
00:51:46,338 --> 00:51:49,739
They're in the drawer of my desk,
the roll-top desk.

613
00:51:50,809 --> 00:51:52,572
Beautiful drawings.

614
00:52:02,487 --> 00:52:04,751
You have to believe me, Simon.

615
00:52:08,827 --> 00:52:12,456
<i>I've been thinking</i>
<i>about the virgins and heaven,</i>

616
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:15,659
<i>and I'm wondering, Simon,</i>
<i>whether it's possible to...</i>

617
00:52:17,036 --> 00:52:20,061
<i>To delay divine reward.</i>

618
00:52:21,106 --> 00:52:25,702
<i>I mean, that way we can kill people</i>
<i>and witness our actions,</i>

619
00:52:25,777 --> 00:52:28,838
<i>feel the satisfaction</i>
<i>that I was talking about before,</i>

620
00:52:30,416 --> 00:52:32,940
<i>and then get martyred after,</i>

621
00:52:33,552 --> 00:52:35,246
<i>get the virgins after.</i>

622
00:52:36,021 --> 00:52:40,253
<i>I mean, what do you think,</i>
<i>can we get a rain check for martyrdom?</i>

623
00:52:40,326 --> 00:52:43,659
<i>What did your father think? Did he qualify?</i>

624
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:47,898
I can't answer your question.

625
00:52:47,967 --> 00:52:52,630
I have... I have no idea if my father
ever intended to kill himself

626
00:52:52,704 --> 00:52:55,469
or if the virgins even appealed to him.

627
00:52:55,541 --> 00:52:57,304
He loved my mother.

628
00:52:57,376 --> 00:53:00,742
And I'm sure if he got to know
the other people on that plane,

629
00:53:00,813 --> 00:53:04,407
he might have liked them, too.
But that's not the point.

630
00:53:05,117 --> 00:53:10,612
I think that this idea we get, that if you get
to know someone, if you humanize them,

631
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:15,251
it stops you from pulling the trigger
or setting off the bomb or whatever...

632
00:53:16,996 --> 00:53:21,398
Well, you know, that's just a myth we're
taught, something we get from the movies.

633
00:53:21,733 --> 00:53:27,365
When the reality might be that that's
what actually inspires an extreme action

634
00:53:27,940 --> 00:53:33,639
that is actually being done to someone
that you like, or in this case, with my dad,

635
00:53:35,079 --> 00:53:36,603
people that you love.

636
00:53:36,981 --> 00:53:38,414
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

637
00:53:38,483 --> 00:53:41,452
<i>- I just want you to step into this world.</i>
<i>- Why?</i>

638
00:53:41,519 --> 00:53:45,581
<i>And show these people that there are people</i>
<i>like you that have suffered and survived.</i>

639
00:53:45,657 --> 00:53:49,559
<i>Not like these bullshitters who don't know</i>
<i>what the fuck they're talking about!</i>

640
00:53:49,628 --> 00:53:51,652
<i>Don't say such words to me.</i>

641
00:53:51,730 --> 00:53:55,063
<i>Come on,</i> Bubbe. <i>Just for me.</i>

642
00:53:55,134 --> 00:53:58,331
<i>Show the world that there are people</i>
<i>like you that have survived.</i>

643
00:53:58,403 --> 00:54:01,168
<i>- Yeah.</i>
<i>- Okay. Come on.</i>

644
00:54:01,239 --> 00:54:05,938
<i>- No. I'll do it myself, darling.</i>
<i>- You want to get up by yourself? Go ahead.</i>

645
00:54:07,545 --> 00:54:10,708
<i>Who cares about them?</i>
<i>I don't care about them.</i>

646
00:54:10,782 --> 00:54:12,773
<i>Just go a little closer.</i>

647
00:54:16,255 --> 00:54:19,884
<i>- Come on.</i>
<i>- I'll do it. What?</i>

648
00:54:20,726 --> 00:54:22,125
<i>Show them.</i>

649
00:54:26,364 --> 00:54:28,492
<i>Yeah, I'll show them. Yeah.</i>

650
00:54:33,005 --> 00:54:36,599
<i>There, you see? 46224.</i>

651
00:54:37,409 --> 00:54:39,501
<i>That's pretty emotional stuff.</i>

652
00:54:41,213 --> 00:54:44,010
<i>Simon, you should be proud of your father.</i>

653
00:54:44,083 --> 00:54:48,110
<i>Your father was a hero.</i>
<i>Your father stood for the truth, Simon.</i>

654
00:54:49,221 --> 00:54:50,847
<i>I'm a victim, too.</i>

655
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:54,152
<i>I'm a victim of years of propaganda,</i>

656
00:54:54,226 --> 00:54:56,217
<i>years of lies.</i>

657
00:54:59,465 --> 00:55:03,025
<i>Here's my tattoo. You like that?</i>

658
00:55:03,635 --> 00:55:05,626
<i>See that? You read that?</i>

659
00:55:06,905 --> 00:55:08,771
<i>That's what I have written on my body.</i>

660
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:13,144
<i>If you had contemplated somebody</i>
<i>other than yourself for five stinking minutes,</i>

661
00:55:13,144 --> 00:55:14,771
<i>face the idea that...</i>

662
00:55:17,548 --> 00:55:18,947
- Hi.
- Hi.

663
00:55:23,621 --> 00:55:25,681
- Who's he?
- Some guy.

664
00:55:26,458 --> 00:55:29,449
- What, is he trying to pick you up?
- Right.

665
00:55:34,432 --> 00:55:37,367
Where do you keep
your mom's violin, Simon?

666
00:55:37,769 --> 00:55:38,759
It's...

667
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:42,505
It's at the top of the cupboard on the back.

668
00:55:44,476 --> 00:55:45,465
Yeah.

669
00:55:47,478 --> 00:55:48,570
Why?

670
00:55:51,516 --> 00:55:54,246
When was the last time you took it out?

671
00:55:54,753 --> 00:55:58,621
When we went to see Grandpa
at the hospital last spring.

672
00:55:58,690 --> 00:56:01,056
Right. The confession that never happened.

673
00:56:01,126 --> 00:56:04,755
- Well, maybe there's nothing to confess.
- I wouldn't bet on that.

674
00:56:06,898 --> 00:56:09,492
Do you know something that I don't?

675
00:56:13,771 --> 00:56:16,001
Would my dad have done that?

676
00:56:16,342 --> 00:56:18,775
Crashed the car on purpose?

677
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:25,315
I wish I could answer that, Simon. I can't.

678
00:56:26,351 --> 00:56:28,876
I didn't get to know him that well.

679
00:56:35,327 --> 00:56:39,626
Look, I was talking to Nick
about the loan idea. It won't work,

680
00:56:40,099 --> 00:56:41,896
not until you're 25.

681
00:56:56,248 --> 00:56:59,045
You know the story about this mark here?

682
00:57:00,184 --> 00:57:02,710
You know it's how your parents met?

683
00:57:05,423 --> 00:57:09,827
See, your mom, she went into
this repair place to get some work done.

684
00:57:09,894 --> 00:57:12,454
And this guy, your dad,

685
00:57:14,599 --> 00:57:16,329
he had this old...

686
00:57:18,336 --> 00:57:21,396
- What do you call this part right here?
- It's a scroll.

687
00:57:22,273 --> 00:57:23,706
A scroll.

688
00:57:25,177 --> 00:57:29,806
He had this old scroll that he had saved,
and he told her he could put it on.

689
00:57:32,217 --> 00:57:33,706
Hers was new.

690
00:57:38,923 --> 00:57:41,552
I don't know the rest of the details.

691
00:57:42,494 --> 00:57:44,893
I found the invoices for the job,

692
00:57:45,664 --> 00:57:48,632
the drawings,
and my dad sketched it all out.

693
00:57:51,637 --> 00:57:52,967
Excuse me.

694
00:58:00,012 --> 00:58:03,139
I guess he wanted her to know
how it would work.

695
00:58:04,416 --> 00:58:06,349
That's very detailed.

696
00:58:07,186 --> 00:58:10,018
He must have liked to plan everything out.

697
00:58:17,329 --> 00:58:19,956
Are you asking me if you can sell it?

698
00:58:27,739 --> 00:58:29,672
Listen to me.

699
00:58:29,740 --> 00:58:32,938
When they died,
I moved down here to look after you.

700
00:58:34,213 --> 00:58:36,407
I wanted to keep you here.

701
00:58:36,715 --> 00:58:38,273
I wanted to keep you in this house.

702
00:58:38,349 --> 00:58:41,581
It was also a chance
to get away from your father.

703
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:46,085
Things are expensive here, Simon.
You should know that.

704
00:58:47,358 --> 00:58:49,224
We're still carrying the mortgage
on this place.

705
00:58:49,293 --> 00:58:51,284
You're going to be needing money
for university.

706
00:58:51,362 --> 00:58:53,422
What do you want me to do?

707
00:59:05,043 --> 00:59:06,840
Can I think about it?

708
00:59:11,048 --> 00:59:13,244
Yeah, you can think about it.

709
00:59:14,052 --> 00:59:16,782
I know it means a lot. I understand that.

710
00:59:21,994 --> 00:59:25,054
There's something
that I don't understand, Tom.

711
00:59:26,398 --> 00:59:28,262
Why would my dad
want to put a new scroll on?

712
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:32,565
I mean, it doesn't really increase
the value of the violin.

713
00:59:32,637 --> 00:59:36,768
You could cut it right off
and it would be just as valuable, right?

714
00:59:37,943 --> 00:59:39,409
I don't know.

715
00:59:45,617 --> 00:59:50,179
There's something that my father did that
might explain his character a little better.

716
00:59:50,255 --> 00:59:53,588
When he met my mom,
he was repairing violins.

717
00:59:53,659 --> 00:59:55,320
That was his job.

718
00:59:56,195 --> 00:59:58,594
She came in with this instrument.

719
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:02,998
Well, it's... It's a long story.

720
01:00:03,501 --> 01:00:06,766
But the last time I was saying

721
01:00:07,438 --> 01:00:09,599
that it wouldn't have mattered if my father

722
01:00:09,675 --> 01:00:11,472
had seen the other people
on board that flight.

723
01:00:11,543 --> 01:00:16,070
It wouldn't have changed his mind
if he'd recognized their humanity.

724
01:00:17,315 --> 01:00:18,943
And I realized

725
01:00:19,150 --> 01:00:21,016
that you never know when

726
01:00:21,085 --> 01:00:24,452
or how something might affect you.

727
01:00:24,523 --> 01:00:26,387
I mean, most of the times
when we find ourselves

728
01:00:26,458 --> 01:00:28,585
most affected by something

729
01:00:29,126 --> 01:00:31,891
is when we think it might be taken away.

730
01:00:33,065 --> 01:00:35,396
And that's when you need to act.

731
01:00:35,601 --> 01:00:38,900
Well, Simon,
I feel like I'm losing you right now,

732
01:00:38,971 --> 01:00:40,438
because if you think
that it's easier to project

733
01:00:40,505 --> 01:00:42,405
your feelings onto a thing
rather than a person,

734
01:00:42,474 --> 01:00:45,875
then I'm wondering what your response is
to what you're looking at right now.

735
01:00:45,943 --> 01:00:50,380
Because right now I'm just a thing
on whatever it is that you're watching me on.

736
01:00:50,449 --> 01:00:52,541
But you're looking at my face
and you're looking into my eyes

737
01:00:52,617 --> 01:00:54,710
and you're listening to my voice.

738
01:00:54,786 --> 01:00:57,846
So whatever it is that you're reacting to,
this thing wouldn't be here if my parents

739
01:00:57,922 --> 01:01:01,552
had been on the plane that day
and your father's bomb had gone off.

740
01:01:02,393 --> 01:01:04,385
<i>That's a stretch, Hannah.</i>

741
01:01:06,697 --> 01:01:12,637
<i>I guess I've had a lot of people</i>
<i>responding who were on that plane.</i>

742
01:01:13,972 --> 01:01:18,409
<i>Maybe there's part of you that wishes</i>
<i>your parents could be part of that club.</i>

743
01:01:18,476 --> 01:01:21,536
<i>This community of people</i>
<i>who are remembering</i>

744
01:01:21,612 --> 01:01:24,103
<i>a catastrophe that never happened.</i>

745
01:01:24,849 --> 01:01:28,411
<i>Look, I guess the assumption here</i>
<i>is that our lives are precious.</i>

746
01:01:28,653 --> 01:01:32,818
<i>But we know that's not feasible.</i>
<i>I mean, it's just not how nature works.</i>

747
01:01:33,391 --> 01:01:35,882
<i>If every life was precious,</i>

748
01:01:35,960 --> 01:01:38,293
<i>the world would not be able to sustain itself.</i>

749
01:01:38,362 --> 01:01:42,163
<i>We'd go forth and multiply ourselves</i>
<i>into extinction.</i>

750
01:01:43,635 --> 01:01:45,659
<i>So it's just common sense.</i>

751
01:01:46,871 --> 01:01:51,103
<i>So... So how... How do we prevent this?</i>

752
01:01:51,943 --> 01:01:54,070
<i>There's disease, famine.</i>

753
01:01:54,146 --> 01:01:57,945
<i>We generate wars, we plan genocides,</i>

754
01:01:58,583 --> 01:02:02,985
<i>but occasionally someone's got to</i>
<i>take the matter into their own hands</i>

755
01:02:03,054 --> 01:02:05,648
<i>and wipe out a bunch of other lives.</i>

756
01:02:06,925 --> 01:02:08,222
<i>When the police, they showed me the tape</i>

757
01:02:08,293 --> 01:02:10,487
of him saying those things,
that was not Simon.

758
01:02:10,561 --> 01:02:12,291
- No.
- That was someone else.

759
01:02:12,364 --> 01:02:14,490
- He was pretending.
- Why?

760
01:02:15,567 --> 01:02:18,592
Maybe he was trying to work something out.

761
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:20,900
Thank you. That was delicious.

762
01:02:21,139 --> 01:02:23,369
What kind of bologna was that?

763
01:02:25,777 --> 01:02:28,836
- It wasn't bologna.
- But something like that.

764
01:02:29,947 --> 01:02:31,938
Yeah, it was something like that.

765
01:02:32,016 --> 01:02:34,211
My shift is ending now.

766
01:02:34,286 --> 01:02:36,413
That'll be $75.

767
01:02:36,922 --> 01:02:38,253
Excuse me.

768
01:02:38,389 --> 01:02:39,550
Any reason why you didn't tell us you were

769
01:02:39,623 --> 01:02:42,251
finishing your shift
before you took my lunch?

770
01:02:42,327 --> 01:02:44,056
I didn't take it.

771
01:02:45,097 --> 01:02:48,123
- It was offered.
- What about deducting my meal?

772
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,559
- Why would I do that?
- Why would you do that? Courtesy.

773
01:02:52,938 --> 01:02:54,235
Courtesy.

774
01:02:57,442 --> 01:03:01,070
It was courteous of this woman
to invite you out.

775
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:05,737
It was certainly courteous of her
to offer me your lunch.

776
01:03:05,851 --> 01:03:10,253
I'm not sure how courteous it is
to now demand a payment.

777
01:03:10,322 --> 01:03:13,018
You know what? Don't fuck with me.

778
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:15,422
Why not? You're fucking with me.

779
01:03:16,762 --> 01:03:20,128
I assumed, given the circumstance,
that it was a gift.

780
01:03:20,599 --> 01:03:24,467
Now you're asking to have it back.
Since I can't give it back,

781
01:03:24,536 --> 01:03:26,367
- you're extorting me for money.
- Right.

782
01:03:26,438 --> 01:03:28,463
Money I earned doing my job.

783
01:03:28,539 --> 01:03:31,907
- No. Do not give him the money.
- Really, it's okay. It's not a problem.

784
01:03:31,976 --> 01:03:34,570
- Why don't you get the fuck out of here?
- No. What do you propose?

785
01:03:34,646 --> 01:03:38,012
That I give your lunch back?

786
01:03:40,985 --> 01:03:44,114
- Oh, yeah? Okay. Okay. Okay.
- Get the fuck out of here!

787
01:03:44,188 --> 01:03:47,385
Get the fuck out of here! Get in the car
and get the fuck out of here!

788
01:03:47,458 --> 01:03:50,018
- Don't touch me again.
- I'll touch you again. Get in the fucking car.

789
01:03:50,094 --> 01:03:52,188
Get in the fucking car.

790
01:04:05,309 --> 01:04:06,572
Thanks.

791
01:04:57,496 --> 01:05:00,431
- Get in your fucking car!
- Big tough guy!

792
01:05:56,987 --> 01:05:59,286
How long have you had this violin?

793
01:05:59,356 --> 01:06:01,222
Since I was 14.

794
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:04,128
My father gave it to me.

795
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:07,791
It's quite a gift.

796
01:06:11,835 --> 01:06:14,737
He must have known that you were special.

797
01:06:15,172 --> 01:06:16,800
What do you mean?

798
01:06:22,581 --> 01:06:24,208
A great musician.

799
01:06:26,985 --> 01:06:29,179
That's what makes me special?

800
01:06:30,355 --> 01:06:31,378
No.

801
01:06:35,726 --> 01:06:38,456
You're special for what is in you.

802
01:06:39,731 --> 01:06:42,164
That's where the music comes from.

803
01:07:01,353 --> 01:07:03,617
<i>Why did you let that go so far, Simon?</i>

804
01:07:03,688 --> 01:07:06,885
<i>You made people remember that day</i>
<i>when they almost lost their lives,</i>

805
01:07:06,958 --> 01:07:10,257
<i>and you told people that it was your dad</i>
<i>who tried to do it.</i>

806
01:07:10,327 --> 01:07:14,525
<i>So whether they were sad for you</i>
<i>or mad at you or whatever,</i>

807
01:07:14,599 --> 01:07:18,467
<i>why would you make people feel</i>
<i>all those things if it wasn't even true?</i>

808
01:07:51,869 --> 01:07:53,769
I'm unloading your car.

809
01:07:55,539 --> 01:07:57,838
You haven't finished your food.

810
01:07:58,576 --> 01:08:00,440
I don't want the food.

811
01:08:02,246 --> 01:08:04,373
You were asking about Simon,

812
01:08:05,215 --> 01:08:08,309
what it was that he was trying to work out.

813
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:12,181
Lady, we're all trying
to work things out. Okay?

814
01:08:13,090 --> 01:08:16,423
Sabine. You can call me Sabine.

815
01:08:18,262 --> 01:08:19,354
Lady,

816
01:08:22,466 --> 01:08:24,730
you force yourself into my house,

817
01:08:24,802 --> 01:08:28,796
you plan to have me tow your car.
So now I know who you are, and it's over.

818
01:08:32,342 --> 01:08:34,310
You don't know who I am.

819
01:08:34,612 --> 01:08:37,274
Yes, I do. Listen to me.

820
01:08:38,983 --> 01:08:42,350
I was never into plays or drama in school.

821
01:08:42,420 --> 01:08:47,153
I don't understand this pretending stuff.
I don't like this pretending stuff.

822
01:08:48,393 --> 01:08:50,792
You're playing games with people.

823
01:08:51,362 --> 01:08:53,386
That's not what I'm doing.

824
01:08:53,631 --> 01:08:56,030
That's exactly what you're doing.

825
01:08:59,436 --> 01:09:02,429
Simon's parents were killed
in a car accident.

826
01:09:02,774 --> 01:09:05,242
- I told you that.
- The driver of the truck said

827
01:09:05,310 --> 01:09:07,403
they crashed into him on purpose,

828
01:09:07,479 --> 01:09:12,074
that Sami drove into the head-on collision.

829
01:09:24,895 --> 01:09:26,886
How do you know his name?

830
01:09:27,698 --> 01:09:30,189
Sami had a condition with his eyes.

831
01:09:30,969 --> 01:09:33,664
He wasn't supposed to drive at night.

832
01:09:33,771 --> 01:09:35,363
How do you know?

833
01:09:38,176 --> 01:09:39,972
I was married to him

834
01:09:41,613 --> 01:09:45,605
for five years until he met your sister

835
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:50,543
at his store.

836
01:09:53,992 --> 01:09:56,756
He was the one who repaired her violin.

837
01:10:03,635 --> 01:10:06,432
The good news is that it's authentic.

838
01:10:09,073 --> 01:10:12,270
The bad news is that... Sorry.

839
01:10:14,212 --> 01:10:19,444
The bad news is that
this whole piece of the violin is new.

840
01:10:20,784 --> 01:10:22,217
<i>Does it affect the sound?</i>

841
01:10:22,287 --> 01:10:25,188
<i>No, no, no. The scroll is purely decorative.</i>

842
01:10:26,056 --> 01:10:30,493
Many instruments at this time
had a graft. Here.

843
01:10:36,701 --> 01:10:40,228
The old violins had a shorter neck

844
01:10:40,305 --> 01:10:43,502
<i>and the angle of the fingerboard</i>
<i>was different,</i>

845
01:10:43,574 --> 01:10:46,635
<i>and then when the new style</i>
<i>was introduced,</i>

846
01:10:47,645 --> 01:10:50,876
a cut was made here.

847
01:10:51,481 --> 01:10:56,818
This way the scroll could be kept
while the neck was being worked on.

848
01:10:59,724 --> 01:11:01,122
Can you...

849
01:11:03,962 --> 01:11:08,261
I've made some drawings

850
01:11:08,332 --> 01:11:11,666
on how I can reconstruct this.

851
01:11:12,904 --> 01:11:14,234
With what?

852
01:11:15,038 --> 01:11:16,596
I... Okay.

853
01:11:26,451 --> 01:11:31,319
<i>I... I brought this with me from Paris.</i>

854
01:11:32,823 --> 01:11:35,884
<i>It was attached to an old violin</i>

855
01:11:35,960 --> 01:11:38,121
<i>that was destroyed during the war.</i>

856
01:11:38,796 --> 01:11:41,594
- The same make?
- No, it's part of the same workshop.

857
01:11:41,666 --> 01:11:44,328
This would make the scroll identical.

858
01:11:46,804 --> 01:11:49,796
I can attach this to your violin.

859
01:11:52,109 --> 01:11:53,304
Here.

860
01:11:54,612 --> 01:11:56,408
Look at the drawing.

861
01:11:58,315 --> 01:11:59,305
See?

862
01:12:00,818 --> 01:12:02,809
It would be like this.

863
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,284
But in the end, it would be smooth.

864
01:12:06,591 --> 01:12:09,492
You feel it? Smooth.

865
01:12:52,636 --> 01:12:55,037
Your mother plays like a goddess.

866
01:12:58,743 --> 01:13:01,371
How long have you been standing there?

867
01:13:03,213 --> 01:13:05,238
He wants us in for dinner.

868
01:13:09,587 --> 01:13:10,610
Hi.

869
01:13:17,395 --> 01:13:19,386
Don't make a scene, okay?

870
01:13:20,097 --> 01:13:21,462
About what?

871
01:13:21,698 --> 01:13:24,690
He says anything during grace or anything...

872
01:13:26,738 --> 01:13:29,672
I'm a guest. I expect to be treated like one.

873
01:13:40,885 --> 01:13:42,819
- You said they were all animals.
- No, no, no, no, no.

874
01:13:42,886 --> 01:13:44,411
The people who took over the airplanes,

875
01:13:44,488 --> 01:13:47,720
the people who crashed them
into the two towers, they were animals.

876
01:13:47,792 --> 01:13:49,622
You said all of us.

877
01:13:50,194 --> 01:13:52,719
- Was that what I said?
- Yes.

878
01:13:53,997 --> 01:13:56,125
Tom, is that what I just said?

879
01:13:59,237 --> 01:14:03,229
Tom, I'm asking you a question.
Is that what I told your brother-in-law?

880
01:14:03,306 --> 01:14:05,207
I don't know. I don't know, Dad.

881
01:14:05,275 --> 01:14:06,537
You don't know.

882
01:14:06,610 --> 01:14:08,373
You're sitting across the table from me
and you don't know.

883
01:14:08,445 --> 01:14:11,346
Is there a problem with your hearing, Tom?

884
01:14:11,815 --> 01:14:14,979
I'll tell you why I wouldn't have said
anything like that.

885
01:14:15,052 --> 01:14:17,112
Why I know I couldn't have said
anything like that,

886
01:14:17,188 --> 01:14:20,418
because, contrary to what you may think,

887
01:14:21,426 --> 01:14:23,291
I'm a civilized man.

888
01:14:23,860 --> 01:14:27,661
And civilized people don't believe
in doing things like that.

889
01:14:28,099 --> 01:14:31,500
- You always change the story.
- What story?

890
01:14:31,569 --> 01:14:33,332
You are a snaky man.

891
01:14:35,872 --> 01:14:39,569
Did he mean sneaky, Rachel?
Is that what your husband is calling me?

892
01:14:39,777 --> 01:14:44,805
Your husband wants to know what's wrong
with raising my grandson with his culture,

893
01:14:44,881 --> 01:14:47,975
and I was explaining that what's wrong is

894
01:14:48,953 --> 01:14:52,149
that his culture's brought nothing
but hatred and violence into this world.

895
01:14:52,222 --> 01:14:55,215
You say this after the Crusades?

896
01:14:55,827 --> 01:14:58,625
- After you sent children to fight?
- What's he talking about?

897
01:14:58,695 --> 01:15:01,563
- The Crusade of Children.
- Oh, yeah, yes, yes, yeah.

898
01:15:01,631 --> 01:15:03,862
You're an educated man, aren't you, Sami?

899
01:15:03,935 --> 01:15:07,462
What do you make of this educated man,
Tom? Does he impress you?

900
01:15:08,706 --> 01:15:12,836
<i>She was drinking a lot.</i>
<i>She always did in those situations.</i>

901
01:15:13,211 --> 01:15:15,202
What situations?

902
01:15:16,012 --> 01:15:18,310
When Dad and him were together.

903
01:15:19,216 --> 01:15:21,878
- Sami?
- Yes.

904
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:24,819
You don't use his name.

905
01:15:25,555 --> 01:15:27,819
I didn't get to know him that well.

906
01:15:27,891 --> 01:15:30,622
He lived with your sister for 10 years.

907
01:15:32,329 --> 01:15:34,854
I wasn't around very much back then.

908
01:15:36,501 --> 01:15:38,024
Where were you?

909
01:15:43,006 --> 01:15:44,201
Listen.

910
01:15:51,181 --> 01:15:54,640
I wish I did get to know him better, Sami.

911
01:15:55,987 --> 01:15:58,216
I could tell Simon who he was.

912
01:15:58,922 --> 01:16:01,983
He needs to know that.
I want him to know that.

913
01:16:03,493 --> 01:16:05,484
Instead he got my father,

914
01:16:06,396 --> 01:16:08,729
the same shit I was raised with.

915
01:16:10,201 --> 01:16:13,728
Except your sister made sure
he wasn't raised with that,

916
01:16:14,505 --> 01:16:18,372
that you looked after him,
that you raised Simon.

917
01:16:21,444 --> 01:16:24,548
My son doesn't answer
because he agrees with me.

918
01:16:24,748 --> 01:16:28,149
He doesn't want to seem impolite
because that's not the way he was raised.

919
01:16:28,219 --> 01:16:30,653
The first thing you need to know
is that this family knows its place,

920
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:32,951
and its place isn't to tell me what I said
or didn't say.

921
01:16:33,024 --> 01:16:36,288
Their place isn't to sit at my table
and ask me to explain myself.

922
01:16:36,359 --> 01:16:40,421
Because the way my children were raised,
this would be considered rude.

923
01:16:42,300 --> 01:16:43,926
Do you understand that?

924
01:16:45,469 --> 01:16:49,632
Maybe it's normal for you to act this way,

925
01:16:50,041 --> 01:16:53,340
to be heated, hot-blooded, impassioned,

926
01:16:53,543 --> 01:16:58,072
rude across the family table,
but in my house this is not acceptable.

927
01:16:58,548 --> 01:17:01,244
- When Rachel's mother was alive...
- Hey, Simon.

928
01:17:01,319 --> 01:17:02,842
...she had a rule...

929
01:17:02,920 --> 01:17:06,219
- Want to go out for a ride in my truck?
...whenever anyone got angry at this table

930
01:17:06,289 --> 01:17:08,587
or anywhere...

931
01:17:09,159 --> 01:17:11,150
- Okay.
...she would nod.

932
01:17:22,139 --> 01:17:23,833
<i>- You don't talk...</i>
<i>- Tom.</i>

933
01:17:23,908 --> 01:17:26,671
<i>Tom, come back. Please come back now.</i>

934
01:17:26,743 --> 01:17:29,144
After she spent the whole week
making this meal,

935
01:17:29,212 --> 01:17:30,543
do you like to see her drinking?

936
01:17:30,614 --> 01:17:31,774
- You have no idea...
- No! No!

937
01:17:31,849 --> 01:17:34,340
...what you're talking about.
- You make her do this.

938
01:17:34,417 --> 01:17:35,715
She is miserable here.

939
01:17:35,786 --> 01:17:37,582
<i>You make her miserable here!</i>

940
01:17:37,654 --> 01:17:41,591
<i>Come, please come. Tom, can you hear me?</i>

941
01:17:41,658 --> 01:17:43,057
...who's civilized!
- Tom, can you hear me?

942
01:17:43,127 --> 01:17:44,753
Please, just come back!

943
01:17:46,296 --> 01:17:49,163
<i>Tom, just come back.</i>
<i>Please, just come back.</i>

944
01:17:49,233 --> 01:17:50,791
<i>...you don't talk!</i>

945
01:18:03,014 --> 01:18:04,572
<i>I pretended I couldn't hear,</i>

946
01:18:05,815 --> 01:18:08,011
that the connection was bad.

947
01:18:08,752 --> 01:18:10,743
And she kept calling.

948
01:18:11,454 --> 01:18:13,286
And I didn't pick up.

949
01:18:15,626 --> 01:18:16,922
Why not?

950
01:18:18,796 --> 01:18:21,355
Because someone
was finally giving it to him.

951
01:18:21,431 --> 01:18:25,198
No one had ever stood up to him
like that, confronted him like that.

952
01:18:25,269 --> 01:18:28,261
I wanted him to explode for me.

953
01:18:31,742 --> 01:18:34,073
That's what I wanted Sami to do.

954
01:18:36,747 --> 01:18:40,614
- Explode?
- Yes.

955
01:18:44,488 --> 01:18:47,217
- How long did it last?
- I don't know.

956
01:18:48,826 --> 01:18:52,023
He must have seen
that she was too drunk to drive.

957
01:18:55,231 --> 01:18:59,190
I know... I know it's not my fault.

958
01:19:00,637 --> 01:19:02,662
But it is your fault.

959
01:19:04,641 --> 01:19:06,667
You didn't answer her call for help.

960
01:19:06,743 --> 01:19:09,234
If you had driven back,
you could have taken them home.

961
01:19:09,313 --> 01:19:11,645
Sami wouldn't have had to drive.

962
01:19:16,453 --> 01:19:20,720
You have lived with this far too long
to deny your responsibility.

963
01:19:25,529 --> 01:19:28,430
When I got back it was done.
They were gone.

964
01:19:31,268 --> 01:19:34,600
I walked in, my father's screaming
that he did it on purpose.

965
01:19:34,671 --> 01:19:35,764
Okay?

966
01:19:36,239 --> 01:19:37,969
That he killed himself and Rachel.

967
01:19:38,042 --> 01:19:42,001
That he called from the car and said
he was going to kill himself and Rachel.

968
01:19:42,078 --> 01:19:44,377
- Why?
- 'Cause he was a monster.

969
01:19:45,615 --> 01:19:50,109
That's what my dad always thought,
and now there's no one to disprove him.

970
01:19:53,157 --> 01:19:54,248
Okay?

971
01:19:55,826 --> 01:19:59,523
But Sami was not a monster.

972
01:20:01,131 --> 01:20:02,224
No.

973
01:20:04,001 --> 01:20:05,229
Not him.

974
01:21:23,881 --> 01:21:26,782
How long have you known
that Simon was their child?

975
01:21:27,051 --> 01:21:29,679
The moment I was transferred to the school.

976
01:21:30,421 --> 01:21:32,787
The moment I saw his last name.

977
01:21:36,025 --> 01:21:40,326
It became my secret.

978
01:21:44,734 --> 01:21:46,327
Does Simon know?

979
01:21:48,238 --> 01:21:49,262
No.

980
01:21:56,247 --> 01:21:57,975
I watched him grow.

981
01:22:00,451 --> 01:22:04,011
I always saw him as Sami's child.

982
01:22:04,387 --> 01:22:07,356
Not the way he looks. His manner.

983
01:22:11,028 --> 01:22:17,091
These things became
much more complicated as Simon grew.

984
01:22:18,502 --> 01:22:22,164
And that's when you decided
to visit his house.

985
01:22:23,006 --> 01:22:24,735
I used to drive by.

986
01:22:26,076 --> 01:22:30,979
I would watch him inside,
playing with Simon, cooking.

987
01:22:31,047 --> 01:22:32,981
He was a great cook.

988
01:22:39,957 --> 01:22:43,484
I watched him put up
the Christmas decorations.

989
01:22:44,127 --> 01:22:46,858
That was very generous of him,

990
01:22:48,498 --> 01:22:50,966
coming from the upbringing he had.

991
01:22:58,341 --> 01:23:01,800
I'm sorry. I should have never done that,

992
01:23:02,479 --> 01:23:04,470
come to the house.

993
01:23:05,783 --> 01:23:07,807
What were you expecting to find?

994
01:23:09,819 --> 01:23:11,447
I don't know.

995
01:23:13,591 --> 01:23:14,887
I don't.

996
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:31,998
Thanks, man.

997
01:26:25,181 --> 01:26:27,445
<i>You can sell the violin now, Tom.</i>

998
01:26:28,417 --> 01:26:30,351
<i>You have my permission.</i>

999
01:26:34,323 --> 01:26:37,487
<i>Remember when I asked you</i>
<i>about cutting the scroll off?</i>

1000
01:26:38,862 --> 01:26:42,457
<i>Well, it's something that I had to do.</i>

1001
01:26:42,966 --> 01:26:45,867
<i>It's kind of hard to describe why.</i>

1002
01:26:47,503 --> 01:26:50,904
<i>I don't think it'll affect the value very much</i>

1003
01:26:51,341 --> 01:26:54,640
<i>since it doesn't change the sound.</i>

1004
01:26:55,878 --> 01:26:58,779
<i>I hope it'll pay for all the things</i>
<i>that we'll need.</i>

1005
01:27:59,275 --> 01:28:01,470
I'm going to the Holy Land.

1006
01:28:02,112 --> 01:28:03,875
It's all the Holy Land.

1007
01:28:12,722 --> 01:28:14,850
<i>I can feel the baby kicking.</i>

1008
01:28:40,082 --> 01:28:43,746
Grandpa, I really need to know
what happened that night.

1009
01:28:44,654 --> 01:28:46,747
He was going to kill her.

1010
01:28:48,792 --> 01:28:52,488
- He called and said...
- He could have called to apologize

1011
01:28:52,561 --> 01:28:56,395
or to find out if I was back.
Or it could have been my mother.

1012
01:30:03,766 --> 01:30:05,757
Would you like to come in?

1013
01:30:07,470 --> 01:30:08,904
For coffee?

1014
01:30:12,175 --> 01:30:15,372
Must be strange
to see those wedding photographs.

1015
01:30:16,046 --> 01:30:18,139
He never said he wasn't married.

1016
01:30:18,280 --> 01:30:21,408
It's part of the reason
my dad was so suspicious of him.

1017
01:30:22,085 --> 01:30:26,488
- If he could do that to me...
- That sort of idea, yeah.

1018
01:30:28,091 --> 01:30:30,787
Except your father did not know me.

1019
01:30:31,094 --> 01:30:34,859
If he did, maybe he would understand
what Sami was running away from.

1020
01:30:35,064 --> 01:30:37,033
What do you mean?

1021
01:30:38,068 --> 01:30:41,902
- I have strange ways.
- Yes, you do.

1022
01:30:43,573 --> 01:30:45,972
You thought I was crazy. You thought...

1023
01:30:46,042 --> 01:30:50,912
You told Simon that people dressed like me
don't come to your part of town.

1024
01:30:52,282 --> 01:30:55,944
- You had him record the conversation?
- He told me about it.

1025
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:01,282
You were testing me to see if I'd explode.

1026
01:31:02,091 --> 01:31:03,252
Yeah?

1027
01:31:04,293 --> 01:31:07,592
- And you refused to let that happen.
- Yeah. Not in front of Simon.

1028
01:31:08,331 --> 01:31:11,891
And if Simon wasn't there,
would you have beaten me?

1029
01:31:11,967 --> 01:31:15,563
- Like you attacked that man today?
- He was going to vomit on us.

1030
01:31:18,507 --> 01:31:22,171
What if I did that now?

1031
01:31:23,212 --> 01:31:25,340
Hey. Stop it.

1032
01:31:30,186 --> 01:31:32,621
Do you think I would do that?

1033
01:31:32,689 --> 01:31:37,057
- Vomit on my own rug to prove a point?
- I'm not sure.

1034
01:31:37,860 --> 01:31:40,625
You must think I'm capable of anything.

1035
01:31:41,931 --> 01:31:44,695
Isn't it best to stay away
from people like me?

1036
01:31:48,572 --> 01:31:49,731
Maybe.

1037
01:31:50,806 --> 01:31:53,970
Except people like me are everywhere,

1038
01:31:54,743 --> 01:31:57,507
people who are capable of anything,

1039
01:31:58,014 --> 01:32:02,451
capable of seeking justice, seeking revenge.

1040
01:32:03,220 --> 01:32:07,384
- For what?
- I lost my entire family in Lebanon.

1041
01:32:07,890 --> 01:32:12,918
One day I came back home from school
and they were wiped out, just like that.

1042
01:32:17,900 --> 01:32:19,765
Sami was my salvation.

1043
01:32:21,938 --> 01:32:25,965
He provided me
with something I could believe in.

1044
01:32:29,512 --> 01:32:32,106
I don't know what you expect from us.

1045
01:32:35,618 --> 01:32:38,452
I would like to be a part of Simon's life.

1046
01:32:41,591 --> 01:32:42,649
Why?

1047
01:32:43,827 --> 01:32:45,418
He's all I have.

1048
01:32:48,364 --> 01:32:51,425
I was never upset at my husband
for leaving me.

1049
01:32:52,536 --> 01:32:54,298
I can't explain why.

1050
01:32:55,771 --> 01:32:58,206
Your sister was from such a different world,

1051
01:32:58,274 --> 01:33:00,265
and she gave him a child.

1052
01:33:01,578 --> 01:33:03,341
Sami wanted a child.

1053
01:33:13,989 --> 01:33:17,323
You're going to have to pay for the ticket.
The tow was free.

1054
01:33:33,643 --> 01:33:34,871
<i>Grandpa.</i>

1055
01:33:35,612 --> 01:33:38,911
<i>I really need to know</i>
<i>what happened that night.</i>

1056
01:33:39,315 --> 01:33:41,511
<i>He was going to kill her.</i>

1057
01:33:43,619 --> 01:33:47,283
<i>- He called and said...</i>
<i>- He could have called to apologize</i>

1058
01:33:47,356 --> 01:33:51,020
<i>or to find out if I was back.</i>
<i>It could have been my mother calling.</i>

1059
01:33:55,265 --> 01:33:58,029
<i>You have to believe me, Simon.</i>

1060
01:33:59,802 --> 01:34:01,963
<i>Your father was a killer.</i>

1061
01:35:04,466 --> 01:35:07,458
Why didn't you tell me about this before?

1062
01:35:11,341 --> 01:35:14,332
I didn't think it was appropriate.

1063
01:35:16,011 --> 01:35:17,672
Yeah, good call.

1064
01:35:20,015 --> 01:35:21,711
He looked happy.

1065
01:35:24,054 --> 01:35:25,247
He was.

1066
01:35:26,355 --> 01:35:27,845
We were happy.

1067
01:35:29,759 --> 01:35:31,658
And then what happened?

1068
01:35:33,595 --> 01:35:35,393
Then he met your mom.

1069
01:35:36,899 --> 01:35:38,423
You let him go.

1070
01:35:38,935 --> 01:35:39,958
No.

1071
01:35:41,337 --> 01:35:43,067
I never let him go.
