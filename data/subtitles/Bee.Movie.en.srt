00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,690
Hi, welcome
to the Bee Movie DVD commentary.

2
00:00:10,773 --> 00:00:16,487
I'm here with the makers of the film,
directors, writers, producers, editors.

3
00:00:16,571 --> 00:00:19,991
You're gonna meet them all
and get our impressions

4
00:00:20,074 --> 00:00:23,202
of different things that we liked
and things we tried.

5
00:00:23,286 --> 00:00:24,996
Some succeeded, some failed.

6
00:00:25,079 --> 00:00:28,041
A bit of the inside world
of the making of the movie.

7
00:00:28,124 --> 00:00:30,251
Hope you enjoy it.

8
00:00:30,335 --> 00:00:34,130
I'm Barry Marder,
one of the co-writers on the Bee Movie.

9
00:00:34,213 --> 00:00:36,090
- And...
- That's it.

10
00:00:38,092 --> 00:00:43,223
That's all you got. Hello, I'm Simon
J Smith, director of Bee Movie.

11
00:00:43,306 --> 00:00:47,477
I'm Jerry Seinfeld.
I'm the star of the movie.

12
00:00:48,228 --> 00:00:51,022
Steven Hickner,
one of the directors of Bee Movie.

13
00:00:51,105 --> 00:00:55,109
Christina Steinberg, the producer,
one of the producers on Bee Movie.

14
00:00:55,193 --> 00:00:57,362
I'm Nick Fletcher, the editor.

15
00:00:58,404 --> 00:01:02,951
This is my company, by the way,
Columbus 81 Productions.

16
00:01:03,034 --> 00:01:06,788
- First time it's been in credits?
- First time it's ever onscreen.

17
00:01:06,871 --> 00:01:08,831
- Fantastic.
- That's pretty great.

18
00:01:08,915 --> 00:01:11,918
Want to talk about
that idea you had about the Frisbee?

19
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:14,671
That scene where
the Frisbee hits the hive.

20
00:01:14,754 --> 00:01:16,172
- Right.
- I forgot that.

21
00:01:16,256 --> 00:01:20,635
The movie used to begin
with a Frisbee hitting the hive...

22
00:01:20,718 --> 00:01:24,180
- And all the bees...
...swing into action and sirens.

23
00:01:24,264 --> 00:01:28,309
- They patched it up in ten seconds.
- We cut it because nobody laughed.

24
00:01:28,393 --> 00:01:32,480
I love that inside Barry's home
everything's made of wax.

25
00:01:32,564 --> 00:01:36,317
Combinations of wax and honey.
No other substance inside the hive.

26
00:01:36,401 --> 00:01:40,822
It's either wax or honey.
And honey's good for everything.

27
00:01:40,905 --> 00:01:44,450
You can put it in your car, petrol.
Put it on your cereal.

28
00:01:44,534 --> 00:01:47,579
You can drink it, you can
eat it, you can fry it, cook it.

29
00:01:47,662 --> 00:01:50,623
It's a very multi-purpose substance.

30
00:01:50,707 --> 00:01:55,169
- I love that he does his hair there.
- That's some real Bert Convy hair.

31
00:02:00,633 --> 00:02:04,345
- Barry's car looks like your car.
- It does. I have a car like that.

32
00:02:04,429 --> 00:02:07,140
- Yeah.
- The way his car spins out there.

33
00:02:07,223 --> 00:02:10,935
He had to. I made sure there
was a nice over-steer there.

34
00:02:11,019 --> 00:02:14,230
- I like this shift.
- Yeah. Will put that in.

35
00:02:14,314 --> 00:02:18,943
- There's lots of great little details.
- What does it say under "Frisbee hits"?

36
00:02:19,027 --> 00:02:22,447
- "Internet down".
- What does it say under that?

37
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,533
- Can we go back?
- "Person heard a sound, then Wham-O."

38
00:02:25,617 --> 00:02:29,621
Because Wham-O, of course,
being the company that makes Frisbee,

39
00:02:29,704 --> 00:02:32,874
- we thought that was clever.
- What else do they make?

40
00:02:32,957 --> 00:02:37,253
- That's it.
- They make Whee-Lo and Water Wiggle.

41
00:02:37,337 --> 00:02:38,922
- Really?
- Steve would know.

42
00:02:39,005 --> 00:02:41,841
- These have great sound effects too.
- Yeah.

43
00:02:41,925 --> 00:02:45,345
Will Files, who's the sound designer,
with brilliant people

44
00:02:45,428 --> 00:02:48,348
from Skywalker, did an amazing job.

45
00:02:56,105 --> 00:03:00,109
This joke, I think,
is the oldestjoke in the movie.

46
00:03:00,193 --> 00:03:03,112
- Really?
- Which I love.

47
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:07,033
- It has lasted from day one.
- In different places.

48
00:03:07,116 --> 00:03:10,536
- We always wanted to save it.
- The squirrel joke.

49
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,582
- Over 212 scripts.
- It survived all of it.

50
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:19,671
One of my favourite things in the movie,
the bee Atlas holding up the flower.

51
00:03:19,754 --> 00:03:22,340
With the globe in the middle
of the flower.

52
00:03:22,423 --> 00:03:26,594
That was a good moment for you
when that was finished.

53
00:03:26,678 --> 00:03:30,848
The character effects guys
did brilliant things, like the tassel.

54
00:03:30,932 --> 00:03:33,601
- It was really lovely.
- That's Larry Miller.

55
00:03:33,685 --> 00:03:38,648
- Yay!
- Dean Buzzwell, head of this college

56
00:03:38,731 --> 00:03:44,279
that Barry goes to. Larry Miller does
such a good job at keeping enthusiasm

57
00:03:44,362 --> 00:03:47,365
of Buzzwell, and how much
he loves working with honey.

58
00:03:52,662 --> 00:03:56,207
The bees fit in with the
weight problem of today, don't they?

59
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:59,669
- Like teenagers...
- Don't know what you're talking about.

60
00:03:59,752 --> 00:04:02,422
The first society
to have a weight problem.

61
00:04:02,505 --> 00:04:07,051
The bees were the frontrunner of husky,
of children's husky.

62
00:04:07,135 --> 00:04:09,345
Too much sugar.

63
00:04:09,429 --> 00:04:12,682
It's the sugar, isn't it?
If they got rid of honey and sugar,

64
00:04:12,765 --> 00:04:14,809
they would be slimmed down.

65
00:04:25,904 --> 00:04:29,324
Wanna talk about the fight Barry
used to have with Buzzwell?

66
00:04:29,407 --> 00:04:32,827
The movie used to open with Barry
interviewed for his job.

67
00:04:32,911 --> 00:04:35,038
We should show that scene.

68
00:04:35,121 --> 00:04:38,583
- It may be one of the extras.
- We can't stop the movie now.

69
00:04:39,417 --> 00:04:42,337
We'll show it later.

70
00:04:43,254 --> 00:04:45,590
- These are great colours.
- Yeah.

71
00:04:45,673 --> 00:04:50,845
This sequence used to be an interview
with Barry. We settled on this.

72
00:04:50,929 --> 00:04:54,641
And this is the first time
we've ever seen it all completed.

73
00:04:54,724 --> 00:04:57,685
- First time watching this.
- With effects finished.

74
00:04:57,769 --> 00:05:01,147
With everything finished in it,
graded and everything.

75
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:05,401
That wasn't finished
when we wrapped the movie.

76
00:05:05,485 --> 00:05:08,780
No. It wasn't finished
when I was doing the grade either.

77
00:05:08,863 --> 00:05:12,325
- No.
- There used to be an empty desk beat,

78
00:05:12,408 --> 00:05:16,454
where the bees saw an empty desk.
They need to fill the job instantly.

79
00:05:16,537 --> 00:05:17,664
"Empty desk!"

80
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:25,964
You never saw this
with the newspaper all finished.

81
00:05:26,047 --> 00:05:27,507
Looks pretty good.

82
00:05:30,551 --> 00:05:31,928
Fat free.

83
00:05:33,763 --> 00:05:35,348
- That's funny.
- Good.

84
00:05:35,431 --> 00:05:37,350
- The Urban Wife.
- Came out great.

85
00:05:37,433 --> 00:05:39,811
- Is that what it's called?
- Yeah.

86
00:05:42,605 --> 00:05:45,650
- I love the noise.
- How many iterations of the Krelman

87
00:05:45,733 --> 00:05:48,861
- did we do?
- True. There used to not be bees on it.

88
00:05:48,945 --> 00:05:50,530
- Yeah.
- Right.

89
00:05:52,574 --> 00:05:55,660
My wife is pointing out to me
that you learn quite a bit

90
00:05:55,743 --> 00:05:57,996
about a number of different things.

91
00:05:58,079 --> 00:06:02,709
You learn about bees,
you learn about... kind of...

92
00:06:04,002 --> 00:06:07,589
...kind of a biological interdependency
of the planet.

93
00:06:07,672 --> 00:06:12,468
How insects and humans and animals
and produce all kind of work

94
00:06:12,552 --> 00:06:14,470
and depend on each other.

95
00:06:14,554 --> 00:06:18,182
It really wasn't anything that we,
you know, put in there.

96
00:06:18,266 --> 00:06:22,353
We weren't trying to educate anybody,
but it was necessary for us

97
00:06:22,437 --> 00:06:27,775
to tell our story to make these points.
We found ways of sliding it in

98
00:06:27,859 --> 00:06:32,363
so the medicine goes down
with a little bit of sugar.

99
00:06:32,447 --> 00:06:37,243
You don't even realise you're learning
about the world when you watch the film.

100
00:06:37,327 --> 00:06:42,040
She was saying it's such a nice thing
for kids, that they learn something,

101
00:06:42,123 --> 00:06:43,750
besides being entertained.

102
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,961
That was part of what we wanted
to try and do with Barry.

103
00:06:47,045 --> 00:06:48,463
- Great.
- Form dissolve.

104
00:06:48,546 --> 00:06:51,716
Nice little circle dissolve and wipe
from Star Wars.

105
00:06:53,509 --> 00:06:58,556
This is the last scene we completed.
It was the most difficult one, remember?

106
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,185
- This was really tricky.
- Many, many versions.

107
00:07:04,437 --> 00:07:05,813
"Bee goes berserk".

108
00:07:05,897 --> 00:07:08,691
- I love that.
- "Stings seven, then self."

109
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:09,984
Stings self.

110
00:07:11,194 --> 00:07:14,864
- "Then self".
- There used to be 1,000-tuplets.

111
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:18,701
- "Queen delivers 1,000-tuplets".
- This took a long time to get right.

112
00:07:18,701 --> 00:07:20,036
- "Queen delivers 1,000-tuplets".
- This took a long time to get right.

113
00:07:20,119 --> 00:07:23,581
This, too, was a leap of faith
because it was never completed.

114
00:07:23,665 --> 00:07:27,126
That was in the storyboard
from the beginning, but we never had

115
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,753
what it was gonna look like.

116
00:07:30,004 --> 00:07:32,674
There's the nice beauty shot
of your statue.

117
00:07:32,757 --> 00:07:35,885
- Yeah.
- Here come the lads.

118
00:07:40,473 --> 00:07:44,686
Those wicked sounds are from the P-51,
which was your idea, Jerry.

119
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:48,481
It was. The P-51 Mustang from WWII.

120
00:07:48,565 --> 00:07:51,484
We plundered the vaults
of Saving Private Ryan,

121
00:07:51,568 --> 00:07:55,071
'cause they'd shot a load of P-51s.
They had fantastic fly-bys.

122
00:07:55,154 --> 00:07:58,866
Right. Look at all the different
wardrobes that each bee has.

123
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:01,411
We... There's over...

124
00:08:01,494 --> 00:08:06,082
I think there's over
900 male costumes and 800...

125
00:08:06,165 --> 00:08:08,668
No, 1,200 female costumes.

126
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:11,921
I've never seen this honey before.
It's fantastic.

127
00:08:12,005 --> 00:08:15,008
- I'm glad you like it.
- That's a good sign.

128
00:08:15,091 --> 00:08:17,969
The whole movie is an Elvis bee movie.

129
00:08:18,052 --> 00:08:21,973
Every bee is kind of
an Elvis impersonator.

130
00:08:22,056 --> 00:08:25,602
- With the sideburns.
- And heaviness and puffiness.

131
00:08:27,312 --> 00:08:29,772
- That was '72, if I...
- Oh, God.

132
00:08:29,856 --> 00:08:32,567
- '74, maybe.
- That's what a good comedian does.

133
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:37,864
He feels for the soft underbelly
of everything and sticks the knife in.

134
00:08:38,948 --> 00:08:41,784
I'll get berated in the car for this.
How dare you...

135
00:08:41,868 --> 00:08:44,746
Berated in the Car:
The Barry Marder Story.

136
00:08:44,829 --> 00:08:48,458
People, when they talk to you,
inadvertently will say something

137
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:51,294
that should be the title
of their autobiography.

138
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:55,506
- Barry's will be Berated in the Car.
- Right.

139
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:57,675
- I love this bit.
- Yeah.

140
00:08:57,759 --> 00:09:00,470
- The animation's fantastic.
- Yeah.

141
00:09:00,553 --> 00:09:03,932
Adam's expression here
as he's being slapped...

142
00:09:05,308 --> 00:09:08,186
- So funny.
- Thatjoke came out in the animation.

143
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:10,855
- A lot of slapping in this movie.
- There is.

144
00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:14,275
- I love that as well.
- There's a new trailer they have on TV.

145
00:09:14,359 --> 00:09:16,319
- It's all slapping.
- It's great.

146
00:09:16,402 --> 00:09:19,072
- It's "Let the slap fest begin".
- Really?

147
00:09:19,155 --> 00:09:23,159
It's just all slapping
in a 30-second spot. Slapping.

148
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:25,828
- It's really funny.
- With the mosquito.

149
00:09:25,912 --> 00:09:28,623
- Everything. On the plane.
- There's a lot.

150
00:09:28,706 --> 00:09:31,292
This looks like a bee Elvis convention.

151
00:09:34,254 --> 00:09:38,174
- They're big fans of Elvis, the bees.
- Really?

152
00:09:38,258 --> 00:09:40,093
Bee Elvis convention.

153
00:09:40,093 --> 00:09:41,511
Bee Elvis convention.

154
00:09:41,594 --> 00:09:44,055
- Here's this moment you like.
- Lovely shot.

155
00:09:44,138 --> 00:09:46,224
Watch Barry's face here.

156
00:09:46,307 --> 00:09:49,394
It's very subtle little acting
he's doing there.

157
00:09:50,603 --> 00:09:53,231
Here's the Sam Levenson character.

158
00:09:54,357 --> 00:09:58,987
- Another broad-based reference.
- No one knows who Sam Levenson is.

159
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:01,364
Voiced by the guy who directed Rain Man.

160
00:10:01,447 --> 00:10:03,908
This is Barry Levinson.
My favourite line.

161
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:22,385
- Shameful.
- It is.

162
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:28,433
His mother is Kathy Bates, who's been
in Misery, About Schmidt, lots of stuff.

163
00:10:31,185 --> 00:10:36,316
I love the parents' wardrobe. They're
the holdover from The Graduate idea.

164
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:39,777
We did open with a big part
of The Graduate.

165
00:10:39,861 --> 00:10:44,782
- Remember this was a Graduate idea?
- Right.

166
00:11:00,214 --> 00:11:04,385
The whole idea of bees driving
when they could fly is hilarious to me.

167
00:11:04,469 --> 00:11:07,555
- Constant driving, too.
- The cars are so cute.

168
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:10,225
- Who designed the cars?
- We did.

169
00:11:10,308 --> 00:11:12,518
- Yeah.
- I love "hair removal".

170
00:11:12,602 --> 00:11:13,937
Who snuck that in?

171
00:11:15,396 --> 00:11:18,608
- "Swatting counsellor".
- "Inspector number seven".

172
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:21,319
- What is inspector 7?
- Restroom attendant.

173
00:11:21,402 --> 00:11:24,239
People still try to figure out
what that means.

174
00:11:24,322 --> 00:11:27,325
- Yeah.
- "Not for the reason you think".

175
00:11:27,408 --> 00:11:29,827
- Yeah.
- Matthew's good in that scene.

176
00:11:29,911 --> 00:11:32,538
- Yeah.
- The animation was lovely.

177
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:46,636
Don't know of any job where you work in
a bathroom, take a break, you come out.

178
00:11:46,719 --> 00:11:49,973
- Now you do.
- I'm doing stand-up 91.

179
00:11:53,518 --> 00:11:56,729
- This is John Hill, he did this.
- Johnny Hill did that.

180
00:11:56,813 --> 00:11:59,983
Everyone was worried
we were mentioning death too much.

181
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:03,278
People tried to make us cut that out
and we left it in.

182
00:12:03,361 --> 00:12:05,697
- Added more.
- Added references to death.

183
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:10,285
When the note was "too much mention
of death", we added ten more.

184
00:12:10,368 --> 00:12:13,746
That was a trend. Every time
they were worried, we added more.

185
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,832
About five times more.

186
00:12:15,915 --> 00:12:19,460
Another big problem
we have in this film is...

187
00:12:19,544 --> 00:12:23,590
...is overly defined buttocks.

188
00:12:23,673 --> 00:12:26,759
- There's way too many buttocks...
- We fixed that.

189
00:12:26,843 --> 00:12:29,679
- We fixed some of them, not all.
- We fixed the women.

190
00:12:29,762 --> 00:12:33,850
There are people in this movie
wearing very tight pants

191
00:12:33,933 --> 00:12:37,812
with a very tight, very low rise

192
00:12:37,896 --> 00:12:43,860
and a seam that goes right up their
posterior that makes me uncomfortable.

193
00:12:43,943 --> 00:12:47,196
Rip Torn had tremendous energy
whenever we recorded.

194
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,324
He's a great guy.

195
00:12:49,407 --> 00:12:54,287
- A bottomless well of enthusiasm.
- And he has a huge amount of energy

196
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:59,042
and you can see it in his acting
and his voice performance.

197
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:01,961
What kind of bee can grow a moustache?

198
00:13:02,045 --> 00:13:05,173
- Very specific one.
- There's two bees with moustaches.

199
00:13:05,256 --> 00:13:09,177
Bob Bumble and Lou Lo Duca.

200
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,555
"Bears and bats".

201
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,599
Lou Lo Duca.

202
00:13:14,682 --> 00:13:17,852
- Why would a bee grow a moustache?
- Why not?

203
00:13:17,936 --> 00:13:20,813
- Why would anyone grow a moustache?
- That's true.

204
00:13:20,897 --> 00:13:25,026
- Why do you need hair under your nose?
- You had for 15 years. Enlighten us.

205
00:13:25,109 --> 00:13:28,696
- Until I wised up.
- You had a moustache?

206
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:33,576
- I'd love to see you with a moustache.
- Why am I growing hair under my nose?

207
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:38,122
- What's the deal with that?
- Must be a funky smell all day long.

208
00:13:38,206 --> 00:13:41,251
- Like old clothes.
- That's what I said.

209
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:43,544
- Can we mention the music?
- Yes.

210
00:13:43,628 --> 00:13:46,923
- Sure.
- This is one of the best bits we have.

211
00:13:47,006 --> 00:13:50,426
- I love this.
- The build-up to them leaving the hive.

212
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:54,097
I love their boots. Get a look
at those boots that they have.

213
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:59,185
You were very specific about those
when we were in vis stuff.

214
00:14:00,603 --> 00:14:03,273
- They look cool.
- Great sound effects too.

215
00:14:03,356 --> 00:14:05,608
- Great scene right here.
- Yeah.

216
00:14:06,734 --> 00:14:08,111
Yes.

217
00:14:10,321 --> 00:14:13,157
"Pound those petunias,
you striped stem suckers."

218
00:14:13,241 --> 00:14:15,577
- I love that boom down.
- It's a good line.

219
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:19,247
- I love this guy.
- How can you not laugh on stem-sucker?

220
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,666
I advertised for that once.

221
00:14:28,214 --> 00:14:31,175
So many people mention
how much they love the flying.

222
00:14:31,259 --> 00:14:35,722
I know. This moment is where
so many people are blown away.

223
00:14:35,805 --> 00:14:39,851
- That painting is fantastic.
- Matte painting is so beautiful here.

224
00:14:39,934 --> 00:14:44,647
I think from the first time I read it,
I imagined this as a rollercoaster ride.

225
00:14:44,731 --> 00:14:48,276
But this shot is so gorgeous.

226
00:14:48,359 --> 00:14:52,155
We added the kites to give
a sense of speed when he flies.

227
00:14:52,238 --> 00:14:55,366
It was also really pretty.
A sense of wonderment.

228
00:14:57,619 --> 00:15:00,496
This part, flying with the bees,
all of it, right?

229
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,748
That purple is nice.

230
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:10,048
- I don't know why that makes me laugh.
- Really just filling time.

231
00:15:10,131 --> 00:15:12,050
Purple is nice.

232
00:15:12,133 --> 00:15:15,178
- I advertised for that.
- How do you like green, Barry?

233
00:15:15,261 --> 00:15:17,055
Green, I'm not crazy about.

234
00:15:18,514 --> 00:15:20,516
- I love the bee vision.
- Yeah.

235
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:24,187
I love the insignia on their jacket,
bee insignia we came up with.

236
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,232
There's different divisions of the bees.

237
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:30,902
- This was a note that Steven gave us.
- That's true.

238
00:15:30,985 --> 00:15:36,032
Remember, this whole explaining science
of pollination came from Spielberg.

239
00:15:36,115 --> 00:15:38,701
Hand of Steven Spielberg in here.

240
00:15:38,785 --> 00:15:40,662
Sprinkling the magic.

241
00:15:40,745 --> 00:15:44,207
This is our explanation
of pollination is

242
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:47,210
- coming up.
- It was a great note.

243
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:52,298
The writer, Andy Robin,
supplies the voice for the Pollen Jock.

244
00:15:52,382 --> 00:15:55,843
- He did a greatjob.
- After many tries.

245
00:15:55,927 --> 00:15:58,471
This took about...

246
00:15:58,554 --> 00:16:04,561
All the effects crew doing animation
and things with pollen and flowers.

247
00:16:04,644 --> 00:16:08,314
Nol Meyer, cinematographer,
did a brilliantjob of making it

248
00:16:08,398 --> 00:16:11,150
feel like we're flying with these guys.

249
00:16:12,193 --> 00:16:15,154
There used to be a fish here
thatjumped up...

250
00:16:15,238 --> 00:16:17,490
- The storyboard.
- Right.

251
00:16:17,574 --> 00:16:20,201
"Watch your bass."

252
00:16:20,285 --> 00:16:24,414
- "Watch your bass."
- That added, what, script 128?

253
00:16:24,497 --> 00:16:27,041
- I think it was 132.
- Added earlier.

254
00:16:27,125 --> 00:16:31,379
Before that, there was a blue jay
at 3.00 that attacked Barry.

255
00:16:31,462 --> 00:16:35,049
- We cut that...
- We had five Cary Grant references.

256
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:37,010
- We did.
- Where did they all go?

257
00:16:37,093 --> 00:16:39,679
You can imagine where they went, Barry.

258
00:16:39,762 --> 00:16:41,180
Hidden.

259
00:16:43,683 --> 00:16:47,270
This was great, the music here
with the outer space idea.

260
00:16:47,353 --> 00:16:49,939
- That Theremin.
- Yeah.

261
00:16:50,023 --> 00:16:52,066
The other world.

262
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,819
Sounds like Simon's phone.

263
00:16:54,903 --> 00:16:58,698
You could really even smell
the tennis balls here.

264
00:16:58,781 --> 00:17:03,620
- I love the line "chemically".
- That's Andy Robin.

265
00:17:03,703 --> 00:17:06,915
'Cause they do have that chemical smell.

266
00:17:06,998 --> 00:17:09,542
Very unnatural.

267
00:17:09,626 --> 00:17:12,045
This animation is amazing.

268
00:17:12,128 --> 00:17:14,130
- This idea...
- And purple is great.

269
00:17:14,213 --> 00:17:17,133
...of making these
tennis players, Ken and Vanessa,

270
00:17:17,216 --> 00:17:20,428
came from you, Simon,
that very first meeting.

271
00:17:20,511 --> 00:17:22,096
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

272
00:17:22,180 --> 00:17:24,891
Having Vanessa and Ken
be the tennis players?

273
00:17:24,974 --> 00:17:27,185
The very first meeting.

274
00:17:27,268 --> 00:17:30,772
- Before, it used to be just two people.
- It's much more fun

275
00:17:30,855 --> 00:17:32,899
having these guys here, I think.

276
00:17:35,068 --> 00:17:38,446
That turned out so great.
Great moment.

277
00:17:38,529 --> 00:17:42,992
This scene, we probably shot
about the most footage for any scene.

278
00:17:43,076 --> 00:17:46,621
I was gonna say, this was in layout for,
I think, 12 months.

279
00:17:46,704 --> 00:17:49,040
A year it was in what we call layout,

280
00:17:49,123 --> 00:17:52,335
the animatic stage of production,
for about a year.

281
00:17:52,418 --> 00:17:56,422
Trying... We shot a lot of footage.
The layout crew did an amazing job.

282
00:17:56,506 --> 00:17:59,342
We balled it down.
It was three times as long.

283
00:17:59,425 --> 00:18:03,721
Then the human world, we tried
to make very sharp and right angles

284
00:18:03,805 --> 00:18:07,725
as a contrast, that the humans
and especially Manhattan

285
00:18:07,809 --> 00:18:10,395
is a very rectilinear kind of place.

286
00:18:10,478 --> 00:18:13,523
The city is laid out on a grid,
the buildings are square,

287
00:18:13,606 --> 00:18:16,025
everything has a sharp edge to it.

288
00:18:16,109 --> 00:18:20,113
- This shot came in late.
- I was desperate for this shot.

289
00:18:20,196 --> 00:18:22,782
- Great little sound effects.
- I know.

290
00:18:23,783 --> 00:18:25,910
Yeah. Skywalker had a field day.

291
00:18:25,994 --> 00:18:29,247
We had a great, good laugh
doing the Foley for this.

292
00:18:31,749 --> 00:18:34,627
- Got a good rhythm to it.
- Yeah.

293
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:37,338
- This, I love the sound here.
- Yeah.

294
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,177
She turns on the radio,
he's sucked through the vent.

295
00:18:43,261 --> 00:18:45,972
- I don't know how that works.
- But New York won.

296
00:18:46,055 --> 00:18:48,683
- Right.
- That's...

297
00:18:48,766 --> 00:18:52,520
- That is Olivia Mattingly, my daughter.
- That's right.

298
00:18:53,313 --> 00:18:55,982
And Ken Morrissey's son
plays the little boy.

299
00:18:56,065 --> 00:18:58,735
- One of the storyboard artists.
- Really?

300
00:19:07,452 --> 00:19:11,456
- This is a late joke as well.
- I know, and a great addition.

301
00:19:13,291 --> 00:19:16,002
- One of my favourite shots.
- Great shot.

302
00:20:09,097 --> 00:20:12,058
This has been in the movie
for a long time.

303
00:20:18,106 --> 00:20:21,484
That's the wonderful Patrick Warburton.

304
00:20:21,568 --> 00:20:25,947
Ken used to be selling Ziamonique,
which was a fake diamond substitute.

305
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,325
We called him Ken
because he's kind of like the Ken doll,

306
00:20:29,409 --> 00:20:33,246
which is this prototypical male figure,

307
00:20:33,329 --> 00:20:39,043
and very stiff, very, you know,
kind of unreal in a way.

308
00:20:51,055 --> 00:20:54,851
Hitting the light bulb, "I don't
remember the sun having a 75 on it",

309
00:20:54,934 --> 00:20:58,271
- that was one of the oldest lines.
- That came from...

310
00:21:03,234 --> 00:21:06,321
That came later,
"These are winter boots".

311
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:10,867
I love this shot because it keeps us
in the mind of Barry. We don't cut.

312
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:15,955
This was always one of the best scenes
that we've always had in the movie.

313
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:18,875
- This is one of the longest.
- That's a cute shot.

314
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:21,586
I love this reaction he does here.

315
00:21:22,587 --> 00:21:23,963
Right here.

316
00:21:25,673 --> 00:21:28,760
That's a little animation thing
that's hard to get.

317
00:21:28,843 --> 00:21:32,889
- The acting was good in this scene.
- It's great.

318
00:21:32,972 --> 00:21:34,933
- I love this bit.
- Yeah.

319
00:21:35,016 --> 00:21:37,435
The animation's fantastic.

320
00:21:38,353 --> 00:21:42,065
This was another one
of our things that we like.

321
00:21:42,148 --> 00:21:46,152
This look on Barry's face
as she saves his life.

322
00:21:46,236 --> 00:21:51,032
This is really where the movie
kind of clicks into gear.

323
00:21:51,115 --> 00:21:54,327
When this relationship begins.

324
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:57,121
Jerry, I remember
when you added that little bit

325
00:21:57,205 --> 00:22:01,334
where you wanted him to be hanging on
to the brochure and linger there.

326
00:22:05,129 --> 00:22:07,298
We kept referring back to that.

327
00:22:07,382 --> 00:22:11,302
- We need to get the guy in the glass.
- "Guy in the glass", we kept saying.

328
00:22:11,386 --> 00:22:13,429
Movie's about the guy in the glass.

329
00:22:16,558 --> 00:22:20,311
"Knocking somebody out
is also a special skill."

330
00:22:20,395 --> 00:22:21,563
That's funny.

331
00:22:22,647 --> 00:22:25,358
That was one of our best transitions.

332
00:22:25,441 --> 00:22:28,027
Oh, yeah, following that drop.

333
00:22:28,111 --> 00:22:31,155
I got some of, I think, the...

334
00:22:31,239 --> 00:22:34,117
...the Honex door thing was great.

335
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:39,497
One of the hardest things in animation,
I learned in this process, is walking.

336
00:22:39,581 --> 00:22:42,709
It's difficult for animators
to get characters

337
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:45,336
to look like they're walking
realistically.

338
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:49,382
It think it's easier with Barry,
but you get all the weight transfer

339
00:22:49,465 --> 00:22:53,136
and the joints...
There's so much to it.

340
00:22:53,219 --> 00:22:55,388
They really struggle with it.

341
00:22:56,306 --> 00:22:59,809
One of the things I remember...
Just kind of a funny moment,

342
00:22:59,893 --> 00:23:03,521
in the early phases of making the movie,

343
00:23:03,605 --> 00:23:06,482
they give you the timeline.
They tell you this was,

344
00:23:06,566 --> 00:23:08,484
whatever it was, spring of 2004.

345
00:23:08,568 --> 00:23:13,448
They say the movie's gonna come out
in 2007, which sounds very Orwellian.

346
00:23:13,531 --> 00:23:16,075
You just go, "It'll never be 2007."

347
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:18,786
I remember when
we were designing Vanessa.

348
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:22,624
We were trying to figure out the type
of girl she should be.

349
00:23:22,707 --> 00:23:26,169
We came up with this hairstyle.
Somebody drew this hairstyle

350
00:23:26,252 --> 00:23:30,173
and we all liked that.
I remember thinking to myself,

351
00:23:30,256 --> 00:23:33,843
"Who knows what women
are gonna look like in 2007?

352
00:23:33,927 --> 00:23:37,138
They could be totally different."
I was really surprised

353
00:23:37,222 --> 00:23:39,974
that clothes and hair
don't look old-fashioned.

354
00:23:40,058 --> 00:23:44,646
They are four years old. "Girls won't
wear their hair like that in 2007."

355
00:23:44,729 --> 00:23:47,482
- I remember that.
- It was like the millennium.

356
00:23:47,565 --> 00:23:50,610
"Maybe we'll have flying cars by then."

357
00:23:51,986 --> 00:23:55,531
- Science fiction movies.
- We were supposed to have flying cars

358
00:23:55,615 --> 00:23:57,867
- by the year 2000.
- Yeah. There you go.

359
00:23:57,951 --> 00:24:00,411
This was the first scene
that we animated.

360
00:24:00,495 --> 00:24:01,829
Yes.

361
00:24:01,913 --> 00:24:04,415
I think also... This little segment,

362
00:24:04,499 --> 00:24:08,586
from when Barry lands on the window
sill through the next couple of scenes,

363
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:13,716
was the first scenes we boarded,
and once we saw it storyboarded

364
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:16,719
and edited, we got excited.
After that point...

365
00:24:16,803 --> 00:24:20,056
Also, when Jerry recorded with Renée,

366
00:24:20,139 --> 00:24:23,518
- that was a huge breakthrough.
- Yeah.

367
00:24:23,601 --> 00:24:27,021
Fantastic feeling
between Jerry and Renée.

368
00:24:27,105 --> 00:24:30,900
It was lovely. We knew we had the
gold in the movie, the relationship.

369
00:24:30,984 --> 00:24:34,112
It felt like a movie
when we saw this relationship.

370
00:24:34,195 --> 00:24:37,156
You bought it,
you realised they could be friends.

371
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,410
When Renée came to the recording,
she had that idea

372
00:24:40,493 --> 00:24:45,164
that playing Vanessa as a young version
of Ruth Gordon's character Maude

373
00:24:45,248 --> 00:24:48,209
- in Harold and Maude.
- She was terrific.

374
00:24:49,752 --> 00:24:53,631
If somebody could make friends
with a bee this easily and quickly,

375
00:24:53,715 --> 00:24:55,008
it would be her.

376
00:25:04,309 --> 00:25:07,353
They always laugh when we cut
to that scene on the sheet.

377
00:25:07,437 --> 00:25:09,564
I don't know what they're laughing at.

378
00:25:09,647 --> 00:25:13,109
You know, on that cut,
it always gets a laugh.

379
00:25:13,192 --> 00:25:16,821
I think it's because they're
listening to you telling a joke.

380
00:25:16,905 --> 00:25:21,618
- It's familiar and makes them happy.
- I've never understood that.

381
00:25:24,746 --> 00:25:26,247
I love thatjoke.

382
00:25:35,381 --> 00:25:39,385
This is a little moment we added
towards the end to make sure we catch on

383
00:25:39,469 --> 00:25:43,431
resetting the audience
for Barry's character, where he was

384
00:25:43,514 --> 00:25:48,811
- in his mind.
- That he wanted to do what was right,

385
00:25:48,895 --> 00:25:51,564
- but couldn't do it.
- He cared about something.

386
00:25:51,648 --> 00:25:54,067
You weren't sure
how he was gonna do that.

387
00:25:54,150 --> 00:25:58,571
Immediately, as soon as you see them
together and hear them talk together,

388
00:25:58,655 --> 00:26:02,075
you go, "They seem like friends.
I believe they're friends."

389
00:26:02,158 --> 00:26:05,954
That's one of the most fun things
in the movie. You don't question

390
00:26:06,037 --> 00:26:08,498
a bee-human friendship.

391
00:26:11,251 --> 00:26:14,963
We tried to do a bunch of stuff
with this mechanic in the background.

392
00:26:15,046 --> 00:26:19,842
I love that line, "You're not gonna
jump?" There was no place to fit it in.

393
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:26,474
I think it's another thing about death
that people didn't want us to do.

394
00:26:26,558 --> 00:26:30,436
He was like,
"Too many suicide and death jokes."

395
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:33,481
Too many leaps off a building
in the movie.

396
00:26:34,941 --> 00:26:38,528
- I love that too.
- This is terrific animation.

397
00:26:46,744 --> 00:26:50,415
A joke by Chuck Martin.
"I'd be up the rest of my life."

398
00:26:50,498 --> 00:26:52,458
Yeah, lovely.

399
00:26:56,254 --> 00:26:59,090
Can we talk about
the alteration we made?

400
00:26:59,173 --> 00:27:02,760
- Sure.
- We did have Vanessa taking a crumb

401
00:27:02,844 --> 00:27:04,804
from the corner of her mouth.

402
00:27:04,887 --> 00:27:08,766
But it looked like she put her finger
in her mouth to remove something

403
00:27:08,850 --> 00:27:11,978
and it made everybody
feel slightly uncomfortable.

404
00:27:12,061 --> 00:27:15,481
- It looked unsavoury.
- That was the intention. I did want it

405
00:27:15,565 --> 00:27:18,985
to be a more intimate connection.
She would take something

406
00:27:19,068 --> 00:27:23,406
from her lip and hand it to him.
I thought that would be exciting.

407
00:27:23,489 --> 00:27:25,700
- This was on her lip a second ago.
- For a young bee.

408
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:26,409
- This was on her lip a second ago.
- For a young bee.

409
00:27:26,492 --> 00:27:31,873
Right. But no matter how we tried it,
we animated that three times,

410
00:27:31,956 --> 00:27:35,168
it always made people feel weirded out.

411
00:27:35,251 --> 00:27:39,172
We changed it to... It was a wise
choice, with the finger on the...

412
00:27:39,255 --> 00:27:42,133
We had a lot of bee testing things here.

413
00:27:42,216 --> 00:27:46,179
The only two that made it
were the fly swatter and this one.

414
00:27:48,598 --> 00:27:52,727
Look at the way the floor
reflects like a mirror.

415
00:27:53,978 --> 00:27:57,565
This movie was challenging
because there's so many crowd shots.

416
00:27:57,649 --> 00:28:00,276
There's about 70 percent crowd shots.

417
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,738
There's bees flying around,
operating equipment,

418
00:28:03,821 --> 00:28:08,576
there's a lot of bees. Everybody did
an amazing job of making that happen.

419
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:13,748
That machine in the back we called the
pachinko. This one is the taffy puller.

420
00:28:13,831 --> 00:28:16,417
- Centrifuges there.
- What's this one called?

421
00:28:16,501 --> 00:28:20,004
- Squeegee guy.
- Squeegee guy. Diver Dan. Squeegee guy.

422
00:28:20,088 --> 00:28:22,966
Those are honey vats
with different types of honey.

423
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:26,678
Look at the cups
with the honey water cooler.

424
00:28:26,761 --> 00:28:30,014
Vending machine with honey.
There used to be a fax joke.

425
00:28:30,098 --> 00:28:32,392
- Remember the fax joke?
- Oh, yeah.

426
00:28:32,475 --> 00:28:35,937
That's why the fax machine
in the bottom right-hand corner...

427
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,232
Adam used to get a fax.
His antenna would ring

428
00:28:39,315 --> 00:28:43,903
and then he would kind of squat.
His stinger would fax out a message

429
00:28:43,987 --> 00:28:48,408
- on the paper.
- I believe it was...

430
00:28:48,491 --> 00:28:52,036
- It was Bongiorno's Pizza.
- Yeah.

431
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:56,749
- There was a junk fax.
- "Oh, it's just a junk fax."

432
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:10,346
- I love this bee on the bottom left.
- I love the noise of...

433
00:29:10,430 --> 00:29:13,182
What's he doing, playing a slot machine?

434
00:29:13,266 --> 00:29:18,104
This sounds like noises from
Billion Dollar Brain or something.

435
00:29:19,355 --> 00:29:24,986
This is a good moment to talk about
Jerry, what used to be a musical number.

436
00:29:25,069 --> 00:29:28,114
Right. Here's where they surround Barry

437
00:29:28,197 --> 00:29:30,742
and start going, "Start thinking bee."

438
00:29:30,825 --> 00:29:34,579
It sounds like a musical number here.

439
00:29:39,334 --> 00:29:43,755
It sounds like a musical number
starting. There was a number in there

440
00:29:43,838 --> 00:29:49,510
that kind of threw the tone of the movie
off track. We had to lose that too.

441
00:29:49,594 --> 00:29:52,889
What's great is we have you and Matthew
at the end credits.

442
00:29:52,972 --> 00:29:55,225
You guys were great together singing.

443
00:29:55,308 --> 00:29:59,520
You can hear us singing if you wait
till the end of the credits,

444
00:29:59,604 --> 00:30:02,023
which are eight minutes long.

445
00:30:03,274 --> 00:30:06,361
- Marc Shaiman wrote the song.
- Right.

446
00:30:06,444 --> 00:30:09,030
- Shaiman from Hairspray.
- Very good song.

447
00:30:09,113 --> 00:30:11,449
This worked really well, the transition.

448
00:30:11,532 --> 00:30:13,660
- A great idea.
- The best transition,

449
00:30:13,743 --> 00:30:18,248
from this fizzy bubble, then
his sweater appears, the wings appear.

450
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:24,462
Wanna talk about The Graduate, your
idea at the beginning, him in the pool?

451
00:30:24,545 --> 00:30:29,926
Right. The Graduate is my favourite
movie. I thought this could be,

452
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:35,348
thematically, we could do
a lot of references to The Graduate.

453
00:30:35,431 --> 00:30:39,811
He's running off at night to see this
person he's not supposed to be seeing.

454
00:30:39,894 --> 00:30:43,940
Did I tell you? I didn't tell you guys.
I told you.

455
00:30:44,023 --> 00:30:49,153
Some day, the other day, I was...
When I exercise,

456
00:30:49,237 --> 00:30:52,699
I listen to satellite radio.
I listen to hits of the '70s.

457
00:30:52,782 --> 00:30:54,284
Yeah, you told me.

458
00:30:54,367 --> 00:30:58,413
I'll tell you why I listen
to hits of the '70s.

459
00:30:58,496 --> 00:31:01,874
Because in 1970,

460
00:31:01,958 --> 00:31:05,295
I was a kid sitting in tenth grade
in high school.

461
00:31:05,378 --> 00:31:09,841
And in 1979, I was
on The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson.

462
00:31:09,924 --> 00:31:12,093
So that ten years of my life

463
00:31:12,176 --> 00:31:16,347
I think of as the biggest thing
that ever happened to me.

464
00:31:18,182 --> 00:31:24,439
Anyway, so they were playing
the hits of '69 this week.

465
00:31:24,522 --> 00:31:27,066
And there were
all these fantastic songs.

466
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:31,571
Then they go, "Coming up,
the number one song

467
00:31:31,654 --> 00:31:34,782
this week in 1969."

468
00:31:34,866 --> 00:31:38,077
- It was when we got our first review.
- Yes, it was the same day.

469
00:31:38,077 --> 00:31:38,661
- It was when we got our first review.
- Yes, it was the same day.

470
00:31:38,745 --> 00:31:41,205
Same day we got
our first review of the movie.

471
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:45,585
What was the number one song
of 1969 this week?

472
00:31:45,668 --> 00:31:48,004
- Winchester Cathedral?
- Close.

473
00:31:48,087 --> 00:31:51,090
- Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head?
- Close.

474
00:31:51,174 --> 00:31:53,676
- Wait, don't tell us.
- Sugar, Sugar?

475
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:02,018
What about the whole hive disorder that
suddenly appeared in the real world?

476
00:32:02,101 --> 00:32:05,355
- And then it somehow...
- Colony collapse disorder

477
00:32:05,438 --> 00:32:08,316
appeared a couple of years
into us making the movie,

478
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,694
and it was already our story
that the bees stopped working

479
00:32:11,778 --> 00:32:14,906
after they won all
the honey in the trial.

480
00:32:14,989 --> 00:32:21,246
So that had to be... That and us
bumping into Ray Liotta on 57th Street

481
00:32:21,329 --> 00:32:25,833
and him saying, "Put me in the movie",
and me saying, "Yeah, sure",

482
00:32:25,917 --> 00:32:30,046
and then us ending up actually
doing that, that and hive disorder

483
00:32:30,129 --> 00:32:33,424
as we were making the movie
were the two freakiest things

484
00:32:33,508 --> 00:32:35,843
- that occurred.
- Strange coincidences.

485
00:32:35,927 --> 00:32:38,972
Didn't think you'd put him in.
He heard about the movie,

486
00:32:39,055 --> 00:32:42,308
read that the movie was being done,
these people were in it,

487
00:32:42,392 --> 00:32:45,603
and said, "I can't believe
Jerry didn't put me in."

488
00:32:45,687 --> 00:32:50,692
Then we decided we needed... Let's
have an actor like a Paul Newman guy,

489
00:32:50,775 --> 00:32:56,447
who's got a food line, but make him
a guy who's kind of on the down slide

490
00:32:56,531 --> 00:33:01,119
to make it funny.
And who would be funny?

491
00:33:01,202 --> 00:33:05,415
First you got to find a celebrity that's
got a sense of humour about himself,

492
00:33:05,498 --> 00:33:08,793
which is not so easy either. And then...

493
00:33:08,876 --> 00:33:14,007
It came down to just there's only a
couple of guys that can play that part.

494
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:16,926
We were thrilled to get Ray
and he was...

495
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:19,304
- He's hilarious.
- He's hilarious.

496
00:33:19,387 --> 00:33:21,472
Also, he came in, remember,

497
00:33:21,556 --> 00:33:23,641
- it was in this studio.
- It was here.

498
00:33:23,725 --> 00:33:28,646
He came in here and read
and, I mean, his shirt was soaked

499
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:34,569
by the end of the session
'cause he just gave you 111 percent.

500
00:33:34,652 --> 00:33:38,948
It was really the most exciting thing
for me sometimes, when actors came in.

501
00:33:39,032 --> 00:33:41,868
- John Goodman was like that.
- You and Chris.

502
00:33:41,951 --> 00:33:45,830
Certainly Rip Torn.
Rip Torn was like that. Patrick.

503
00:33:45,914 --> 00:33:50,209
I remember with Patrick, most of the
time you were on the floor laughing.

504
00:33:50,293 --> 00:33:53,004
Let's talk about that for a second
as my penchant

505
00:33:53,087 --> 00:33:56,799
- for autobiography titles.
- Oh, yes.

506
00:33:56,883 --> 00:34:01,095
I tried to give everyone I know...
I feel people, when they talk to you,

507
00:34:01,179 --> 00:34:05,600
inadvertently say something that should
be the title of their autobiography.

508
00:34:05,683 --> 00:34:08,603
Nick Fletcher, our gifted editor, and...

509
00:34:10,271 --> 00:34:13,691
...cinematic mastermind...

510
00:34:13,775 --> 00:34:18,112
One of the things you do in editing
is you'll hear a line,

511
00:34:18,196 --> 00:34:21,032
and go, "I don't like
the way the actor says that."

512
00:34:21,115 --> 00:34:24,953
Each time you make changes. You say
do this, do that. He has to sit there

513
00:34:25,036 --> 00:34:29,666
and assemble this whole thing. It's
just this mind-numbing jigsaw puzzle.

514
00:34:29,749 --> 00:34:34,379
Anyway, I come in after he's done all
this work. I go, "I don't like the way

515
00:34:34,462 --> 00:34:38,424
the guy says that line. Let me hear
the other takes, other versions of it.

516
00:34:38,508 --> 00:34:42,178
That's not a good read on that."
One of them that we had

517
00:34:42,262 --> 00:34:47,183
was of Freddy,
who was the head of the apiary.

518
00:34:47,267 --> 00:34:53,106
So the scene is that they're shuttling

519
00:34:53,189 --> 00:34:57,819
schoolchildren through the apiary,
through the Honey Farms apiary,

520
00:34:57,902 --> 00:35:01,573
- charging them up the wazoo.
- Forty dollars.

521
00:35:01,656 --> 00:35:04,033
For, like, a three-minute tour.

522
00:35:04,117 --> 00:35:08,413
We get the honey, we put it in jars,
slap the label on it, pure profit,

523
00:35:08,496 --> 00:35:10,623
which survived into this version.

524
00:35:10,707 --> 00:35:14,252
They get rid of the kids.
The kids go, "That's the whole thing?"

525
00:35:14,335 --> 00:35:19,757
"Yeah, that's it. Enjoy your four-hour
ride home on that stinking bus."

526
00:35:21,509 --> 00:35:26,931
So I said to Nick, "Do you have any
other versions of 'stinking bus'?"

527
00:35:27,015 --> 00:35:29,183
Nick, what did you say?

528
00:35:29,267 --> 00:35:31,561
I said I got 57 takes.

529
00:35:31,644 --> 00:35:36,774
Which he really did, 'cause we
worked it to death there in New York.

530
00:35:38,067 --> 00:35:42,405
He said, "I have..." It wasn't 57.
The actual number was...

531
00:35:42,488 --> 00:35:46,367
- It was like 36 takes.
- "I have 36 takes of 'stinking bus."'

532
00:35:46,451 --> 00:35:50,079
I go, "That's the title
of your autobiography."

533
00:35:50,163 --> 00:35:52,957
- Thirty-six Takes...
- 36 Takes of Stinking Bus:

534
00:35:53,041 --> 00:35:56,419
- Nick Fletcher Story.
- What about Steve's autobiography?

535
00:35:56,502 --> 00:36:00,840
It's They Call Me Ma'am. Steve cuts
his hair in a very distinctive fashion.

536
00:36:00,924 --> 00:36:05,929
We've never been able to figure out how
Steve gets professional hair cutters

537
00:36:06,012 --> 00:36:07,764
to do this to his hair.

538
00:36:07,847 --> 00:36:12,477
But anyway, throughout his life,
waiters and various...

539
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:14,979
- Police officers.
...servant people...

540
00:36:15,063 --> 00:36:19,067
- Stewardesses.
...stewardesses constantly

541
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:22,946
confuse his gender and say,
"Ma'am, could you put your seat back up?

542
00:36:23,029 --> 00:36:26,616
We're about to land." He looks up,
they go, "I didn't realise."

543
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:28,701
- Sometimes they don't!
- Yeah.

544
00:36:28,785 --> 00:36:32,538
I've been on a flight where they
call me "ma'am" the whole ten hours.

545
00:36:32,622 --> 00:36:37,043
Here's the beauty part of the story:
He doesn't mind it.

546
00:36:37,126 --> 00:36:41,798
That's the weird part of the story.
He's a confirmed heterosexual,

547
00:36:41,881 --> 00:36:44,425
happily married for 25 years.

548
00:36:44,509 --> 00:36:49,472
When he's out with his wife, they say,
"Would you ladies like coffee?"

549
00:36:50,348 --> 00:36:52,100
That happens all the time.

550
00:36:52,183 --> 00:36:56,479
So anyway, then we came upon
the title of Steve's autobiography,

551
00:36:56,563 --> 00:36:59,482
They Call Me Ma'am:
The Steve Hickner Story.

552
00:36:59,566 --> 00:37:02,277
This was in the script
from the very beginning.

553
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,445
- The very first one, wasn't it?
- Yes.

554
00:37:06,030 --> 00:37:07,949
I laughed out loud
when I read this.

555
00:37:08,032 --> 00:37:10,868
This was one of my favourites
when I read the script.

556
00:37:10,952 --> 00:37:14,539
This made me want to do the movie.
Oh, that's me.

557
00:37:14,622 --> 00:37:16,624
That's Simon, in the baseball hat.

558
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:19,711
- There I am again.
- Barry, but he doesn't speak.

559
00:37:19,794 --> 00:37:22,046
You don't get paid for this one, Barry.

560
00:37:22,130 --> 00:37:25,091
- Could it be me, though?
- No, it can't.

561
00:37:25,174 --> 00:37:28,845
- It's not the same model, is it?
- His twin brother.

562
00:37:28,928 --> 00:37:31,306
Same model,
it may be different surfacing.

563
00:37:31,389 --> 00:37:34,559
Supposed to change
the colour of that sweater.

564
00:37:39,898 --> 00:37:43,610
So when is lunch? As Christina
will tell you, I will work like a mule,

565
00:37:43,693 --> 00:37:47,280
- but I like to know when lunch is.
- That's what you work towards.

566
00:37:47,363 --> 00:37:49,949
- That's what I work towards.
- "Let me finish."

567
00:37:50,033 --> 00:37:52,660
After this, lunch will be coming.

568
00:37:52,744 --> 00:37:55,663
- So pay one notice.
- People like coffee and cake.

569
00:37:55,747 --> 00:37:59,250
It seems to go...
It's like potato salad and cole slaw.

570
00:37:59,334 --> 00:38:03,004
- Really just got together.
- Not even close to salad and slaw.

571
00:38:03,087 --> 00:38:07,050
Coffee and cake is at the top
of the human food pyramid

572
00:38:07,133 --> 00:38:11,095
- of greatest combinations ever.
- Don't think potato salad and slaw?

573
00:38:11,179 --> 00:38:14,849
- Chocolate and coffee?
- Salad and slaw, pick one or the other.

574
00:38:14,933 --> 00:38:19,395
Potato salad and cole slaw to me
is like a blind date that worked out.

575
00:38:19,479 --> 00:38:23,983
We're having roast beef, would you like
potato salad and cole slaw also?

576
00:38:24,067 --> 00:38:25,860
Itjust seems to go.

577
00:38:25,944 --> 00:38:29,656
Comparing potato salad and cole slaw
to coffee and cake.

578
00:38:29,739 --> 00:38:33,076
Potato salad and slaw is the
greatest combination together

579
00:38:33,159 --> 00:38:35,286
- in history.
- If I had a phone dial,

580
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:38,539
I would hit the five button now.

581
00:38:38,623 --> 00:38:43,044
No. Coffee and cake
is one of the ultimate human inventions.

582
00:38:43,127 --> 00:38:48,216
Potato salad and cole slaw
are drippy, wet...

583
00:38:48,299 --> 00:38:52,679
When you hear we're having roast beef,
we must have potato salad and cole slaw.

584
00:38:52,762 --> 00:38:55,682
- No. No one says that.
- No.

585
00:38:55,765 --> 00:39:00,728
The amount of evil laughing
from the evil beekeepers is excellent.

586
00:39:00,812 --> 00:39:05,149
Yeah, this is another thing that we...
We apologise for being fans of the film.

587
00:39:05,233 --> 00:39:08,319
If it's obnoxious, we're sorry. But...

588
00:39:08,403 --> 00:39:13,324
But anyway, one of the funny things here
is that we portrayed these beekeepers

589
00:39:13,408 --> 00:39:17,620
as kind of like tobacco company
executives. Really mercenary

590
00:39:17,704 --> 00:39:21,207
and heartless. But the fact
is these people in real life

591
00:39:21,291 --> 00:39:25,378
are the sweetest...
They're like hippies, old hippies.

592
00:39:25,461 --> 00:39:28,298
- They love bees!
- The only ones who care for bees.

593
00:39:28,381 --> 00:39:31,843
They're the only ones that care
about bees and we turn them...

594
00:39:31,926 --> 00:39:34,637
- Look at the face.
- Can't wait to get his payload.

595
00:39:34,721 --> 00:39:38,391
- How about how cool that shot was?
- I love the photo of the two of them

596
00:39:38,474 --> 00:39:42,061
- that comes in a bit.
- Later, we compare them to Enron.

597
00:39:42,145 --> 00:39:44,606
- That's right.
- Yeah.

598
00:39:44,689 --> 00:39:48,651
- That's how thoughtful we are.
- Right.

599
00:39:48,735 --> 00:39:50,820
Look. That doesn't look like Elvis.

600
00:39:50,904 --> 00:39:54,073
It sort of does with the collar.
A sort of Vegas collar.

601
00:39:54,157 --> 00:39:57,702
I can't believe we got "drag queen"
into the final cut.

602
00:39:57,785 --> 00:40:00,330
- Yes.
- That's my biggest surprise of this.

603
00:40:00,413 --> 00:40:03,082
I would have thought someone...
It's a bit...

604
00:40:03,166 --> 00:40:06,002
I wouldn't call that
a family-oriented...

605
00:40:06,085 --> 00:40:07,712
- PG.
- It's somebody who...

606
00:40:07,795 --> 00:40:09,839
That what makes it PG, joke like that?

607
00:40:09,923 --> 00:40:10,965
- Probably.
- Yes.

608
00:40:11,049 --> 00:40:13,801
We had this scene re-written 100 times.

609
00:40:13,885 --> 00:40:20,016
- This was a retirement village...
- We originally created this world.

610
00:40:20,099 --> 00:40:25,063
We were gonna do a Florida condo gag.
We were gonna make it that these bees

611
00:40:25,146 --> 00:40:28,274
were living in a Florida
condo-type environment.

612
00:40:28,358 --> 00:40:33,529
My friend, Sacha Baron Cohen, who
you might know as the character Borat,

613
00:40:33,613 --> 00:40:37,450
watched a screening of the movie.
He said, "I didn't understand

614
00:40:37,533 --> 00:40:42,872
why it was bad that the bees
were stuck in these apiaries.

615
00:40:42,956 --> 00:40:46,292
It didn't look so bad to me."
It was kind of all Formica

616
00:40:46,376 --> 00:40:49,128
and prefab housing.

617
00:40:49,212 --> 00:40:53,633
Because of him, we changed it
to this very... What would you call it?

618
00:40:53,716 --> 00:40:57,720
...downgraded look of the wood...
- Like a work camp.

619
00:40:57,804 --> 00:41:00,139
- Like a Russian tenement block.
- Right.

620
00:41:00,223 --> 00:41:02,642
- POW camp looking.
- They were gonna build

621
00:41:02,725 --> 00:41:06,479
- a bee outlet mall.
- They would say, "We like it here.

622
00:41:06,563 --> 00:41:09,440
- There's a tram. Dinner theatre.
- Dinner theatre.

623
00:41:09,524 --> 00:41:15,780
We saw a bee doing a moth impression
last night. I don't like that humour.

624
00:41:15,863 --> 00:41:18,199
- But he was funny."
- Slapstick humour.

625
00:41:18,283 --> 00:41:21,452
Chewing and biting on the arm.

626
00:41:21,536 --> 00:41:25,039
I saw a very funny Onion
Barry and I have been laughing about.

627
00:41:25,123 --> 00:41:29,836
I always stop at the little box on the
sidewalk. The front page is great.

628
00:41:29,919 --> 00:41:33,172
The headline is,
"Piping hot calzone missing".

629
00:41:33,256 --> 00:41:36,009
Then they have the quote
from the person which is,

630
00:41:36,092 --> 00:41:38,177
"Who would do something like this?"

631
00:41:38,261 --> 00:41:40,305
- What was that from?
- The Onion.

632
00:41:40,388 --> 00:41:42,473
- Hilarious.
- Hilarious magazine.

633
00:41:42,557 --> 00:41:46,394
"Who would do something like this?"
It's such an ugly crime.

634
00:41:46,477 --> 00:41:48,438
- Stealing a calzone.
- Piping hot.

635
00:41:48,521 --> 00:41:52,942
They always have things like that,
the small things of life as headlines.

636
00:41:53,026 --> 00:41:55,778
- "Man's striped shirt stolen".
- Yeah.

637
00:41:55,862 --> 00:41:58,406
This idea is one of our favourite...

638
00:41:58,489 --> 00:42:03,119
This is what we call a writers' room
joke that made it into the movie.

639
00:42:03,202 --> 00:42:07,749
Normally, you come up with the idea
of, "Let's have Barry go on

640
00:42:07,832 --> 00:42:12,211
a Larry King in the bee hive." Let's
say there's Larry King in the hive.

641
00:42:12,295 --> 00:42:15,381
Normally, you go,
"OK, that's funny. Let's do that."

642
00:42:15,465 --> 00:42:18,301
You come up with another name
for the character.

643
00:42:18,384 --> 00:42:22,096
You don't say...
You don't use the real name.

644
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:26,184
So the joke here for us
was that we're so lazy,

645
00:42:26,267 --> 00:42:31,105
we didn't even bother to come
with a phoney Larry King-type name,

646
00:42:31,189 --> 00:42:35,610
whatever that would be.
Larry Hive King or something.

647
00:42:35,693 --> 00:42:37,695
We just called him Bee Larry King.

648
00:42:37,779 --> 00:42:42,575
The idea of that being in any
conceivable universe that you'd create

649
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:46,162
there would be a Larry King,
like any universe would have to have

650
00:42:46,246 --> 00:42:49,666
some sort of carbon,
hydrogen and oxygen,

651
00:42:49,749 --> 00:42:54,087
- you would have to have Larry King.
- It'd be like Moth Tommy Lee.

652
00:42:54,170 --> 00:42:58,508
You'll notice that this mug Barry's
holding is a continuity error.

653
00:42:58,591 --> 00:43:00,885
It's in the sequence preceding this.

654
00:43:00,969 --> 00:43:05,473
- Somehow Barry got the mug.
- Adam has the mug when he's packing.

655
00:43:05,557 --> 00:43:08,518
- They all have the mug.
- But that's later!

656
00:43:08,601 --> 00:43:12,313
- It's possible he could have it.
- It's the only mug we could afford.

657
00:43:12,397 --> 00:43:15,316
- It's in every scene.
- A lot of stuff had to go in this.

658
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,985
We had to move quickly.

659
00:43:18,278 --> 00:43:20,697
It's funny that even kids
know Larry King.

660
00:43:20,780 --> 00:43:25,159
At all the previews, like,
the six year olds know who he is.

661
00:43:25,243 --> 00:43:28,538
He's on in everybody's house.
I think the show is the dots.

662
00:43:28,621 --> 00:43:30,748
I don't think people care who's there.

663
00:43:30,832 --> 00:43:33,710
Nick, when you put
that thing there on the bottom.

664
00:43:33,793 --> 00:43:36,087
- That was Nick's joke, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

665
00:43:36,170 --> 00:43:40,550
That was a greatjoke,
putting that crawl on the bottom.

666
00:43:40,633 --> 00:43:44,178
- "Barry says".
- I didn't see how we could not do that.

667
00:43:44,262 --> 00:43:46,890
You can try a lot of differentjokes.

668
00:43:46,973 --> 00:43:50,894
"Why is yogurt night so difficult?"
We tried many different lines.

669
00:43:50,977 --> 00:43:53,229
So funny.

670
00:43:53,313 --> 00:43:56,983
- It is what you see.
- Ken looks like...

671
00:43:57,066 --> 00:44:00,987
...he has some gigantism in the face.

672
00:44:04,073 --> 00:44:06,451
Gigantism!

673
00:44:09,829 --> 00:44:12,790
- It's a caricature.
- Itjust looks like...

674
00:44:12,874 --> 00:44:15,126
- What we call a pushed character.
- Yes.

675
00:44:15,209 --> 00:44:18,588
- It's stylised.
- Weird stylism.

676
00:44:18,671 --> 00:44:22,133
This was many different lines
because it's on his back.

677
00:44:22,216 --> 00:44:26,554
We used to make fun
of other animated movies that had...

678
00:44:26,638 --> 00:44:30,141
I don't know the term. They
would shoot 150 percent of the movie.

679
00:44:30,225 --> 00:44:34,896
Let's explain that to the audience.
Let's say the movie is 80 minutes long.

680
00:44:34,979 --> 00:44:40,109
In many cases, the movie you watch,
there's another 40 minutes of material

681
00:44:40,193 --> 00:44:44,030
that's been cut, you don't see.
Or another whole movie, in some cases.

682
00:44:44,113 --> 00:44:46,741
What they say...
I'll wrap this up in a second.

683
00:44:46,824 --> 00:44:49,661
What they would say is that...

684
00:44:49,744 --> 00:44:54,666
They made 200 percent of that movie to
talk about the beating the budget took.

685
00:44:54,749 --> 00:45:00,505
But this movie, in terms of ideas
that were tried and tossed...

686
00:45:00,713 --> 00:45:03,841
- Is about three movies.
- At least 300 or 400 percent.

687
00:45:03,925 --> 00:45:07,095
- In storyboard form...
- Remember Willingham?

688
00:45:07,178 --> 00:45:12,225
- That was so great.
- It was a story idea, at one point,

689
00:45:12,308 --> 00:45:15,895
at the end of the movie,
that Bee Larry King would meet up

690
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:20,567
with real Larry King on the USS Arizona
in New York Harbour.

691
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,902
It would be a Japanese surrender scene.

692
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:26,030
- I loved that scene.
- They had an argument.

693
00:45:26,114 --> 00:45:29,158
Larry, when we recorded,
had an argument with himself.

694
00:45:29,242 --> 00:45:32,704
He had an argument
with real Larry King. Yeah.

695
00:45:32,787 --> 00:45:35,415
This is a joke that never...
I love this car.

696
00:45:35,498 --> 00:45:39,168
This car is designed
by Grant Larson of Porsche.

697
00:45:39,252 --> 00:45:42,505
- Really?
- He's a friend of mine.

698
00:45:42,589 --> 00:45:46,301
- Look at the detail on the boots.
- I love those crocodile boots.

699
00:45:46,384 --> 00:45:48,595
Those are Elvis boots.

700
00:45:48,678 --> 00:45:51,055
- This is...
- Remember the joke we had here?

701
00:45:51,139 --> 00:45:54,642
Yeah, remember that? Itjust died.
Remember?

702
00:45:54,726 --> 00:45:56,853
- Yeah.
- Willingham in here?

703
00:45:56,936 --> 00:45:59,939
"I've never had the chilli burger."

704
00:46:01,399 --> 00:46:05,820
We used to have Willingham
on the front steps talking to the grip.

705
00:46:05,904 --> 00:46:08,156
"Do you know who I am? I'm Willingham."

706
00:46:08,239 --> 00:46:10,867
"I'm the world expert on bees."

707
00:46:10,950 --> 00:46:13,828
The grip says to him,
"You missed the talking."

708
00:46:13,912 --> 00:46:15,622
"I had my suspicions."

709
00:46:15,705 --> 00:46:18,082
Quite a few heavy people in the movie.

710
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:22,170
Guess what, Barry?
There's quite a few heavy people period.

711
00:46:22,253 --> 00:46:24,047
In this room, perhaps.

712
00:46:26,007 --> 00:46:30,637
I said to Barry, "Notice there's
a lot of fat guys on motorcycles?"

713
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,307
When one of us says something stupid
on the phone, the other hits

714
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:36,309
one of the keys. Like "foul".

715
00:46:36,392 --> 00:46:39,312
He says, "There's quite
a few heavy people, period.

716
00:46:39,395 --> 00:46:41,981
It's not motorcycles."

717
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:46,194
Fat guys in cars, fat guys walking,
fat guys on planes.

718
00:46:46,277 --> 00:46:49,948
- Fat guy with you right now.
- There's two.

719
00:46:50,031 --> 00:46:52,158
Two fat guys with you now.

720
00:46:52,242 --> 00:46:53,868
You're not fat guys.

721
00:46:54,661 --> 00:46:56,704
I'll have the helicopter leaning...

722
00:46:56,788 --> 00:47:00,875
So the other day this scene was playing
on the Oprah, when I was doing Oprah.

723
00:47:00,959 --> 00:47:02,961
- I told you this story.
- You didn't.

724
00:47:03,044 --> 00:47:05,880
Julian, my son, is four.

725
00:47:05,964 --> 00:47:08,883
This scene comes on,
Barry starts doing...

726
00:47:08,967 --> 00:47:11,594
- He just busts out laughing.
- Really?

727
00:47:11,678 --> 00:47:14,514
- I was really excited.
- That is great.

728
00:47:14,597 --> 00:47:17,767
That makes kids laugh.
I don't know what he thinks that is.

729
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:20,228
- Thought it was hilarious.
- Is he two?

730
00:47:20,311 --> 00:47:22,021
- Four.
- Four.

731
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:24,190
- He's never seen the movie?
- No.

732
00:47:24,274 --> 00:47:27,527
All I have is the commercials.
Four of those 30-second...

733
00:47:27,610 --> 00:47:31,197
Olivia loves it. She gets excited
when it comes on. She screams.

734
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:32,699
Everyone runs to the TV.

735
00:47:33,783 --> 00:47:37,036
Why do you think that is?
'Cause it's Mommy's

736
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:38,913
- or she likes it?
- It's both.

737
00:47:38,997 --> 00:47:42,125
- It looks funny. She laughs.
- Right.

738
00:48:09,027 --> 00:48:13,364
Let's talk about our idea
of how the court system works.

739
00:48:13,448 --> 00:48:16,326
From the moment, the very beginning,

740
00:48:16,409 --> 00:48:18,703
the moment it starts, the jury's hung.

741
00:48:18,786 --> 00:48:21,372
- It would have been a mistrial.
- The moment...

742
00:48:21,456 --> 00:48:25,084
The jury makes it very clear
where they stand.

743
00:48:25,168 --> 00:48:30,882
They let you know. And after
the trial is done, the judge...

744
00:48:30,965 --> 00:48:34,010
There's a jury, but for some reason,
the judge calls it.

745
00:48:34,093 --> 00:48:38,473
- Gets very excited...
- "Let's save time with deliberations,

746
00:48:38,556 --> 00:48:40,308
let's call it what it is."

747
00:48:40,391 --> 00:48:42,268
"I know where you're going here."

748
00:48:42,352 --> 00:48:45,939
This character's played by my friend,
Tom Papa, who's talented.

749
00:48:46,022 --> 00:48:49,108
- Stand-up comedian.
- I heard there's quite a few...

750
00:48:49,192 --> 00:48:51,444
- Also a Pollen Jock.
- Quite a few humans

751
00:48:51,527 --> 00:48:54,072
look like Michael Buffer.

752
00:48:54,155 --> 00:48:56,699
- Who's that?
- Who's Michael Buffer?

753
00:48:56,783 --> 00:49:00,578
Barry is so caught up in this world
of him and his brother living

754
00:49:00,662 --> 00:49:05,333
in this apartment in Toluca Lake.
He makes jokes only his brother gets.

755
00:49:05,416 --> 00:49:10,004
They sit there and watch boxing
every Friday and Saturday night on HBO.

756
00:49:10,088 --> 00:49:13,967
Michael Buffer
is one of the ring announcer guys.

757
00:49:16,219 --> 00:49:20,181
This is a great Simon Smith joke,
where the bear, once he's told

758
00:49:20,265 --> 00:49:22,475
it's over, gives up his performance.

759
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:26,229
He's not really a mean bear.
He's just putting it on.

760
00:49:27,313 --> 00:49:29,440
Just a shill bear.

761
00:49:29,524 --> 00:49:31,276
- Shill bear.
- There's a lot...

762
00:49:31,359 --> 00:49:34,028
- Huge laugh.
- Sting. He was a good sport.

763
00:49:34,112 --> 00:49:36,948
- So great.
- Sting was great.

764
00:49:37,031 --> 00:49:42,120
I love it when he came in to record.
He was wearing his see-through tank.

765
00:49:42,203 --> 00:49:44,539
- He looked attractive.
- Very handsome.

766
00:49:44,622 --> 00:49:47,208
He's in great shape.

767
00:49:47,292 --> 00:49:50,545
He's in great shape, kids,
just so you know.

768
00:49:51,379 --> 00:49:54,841
- He was great, though.
- Look at that puffed hair he has.

769
00:49:54,924 --> 00:49:58,511
- Yes.
- It's like GI Joe glued-on hair.

770
00:49:58,595 --> 00:50:02,432
That GI Joe With Lifelike Hair.
Kung Fu Grip, that guy.

771
00:50:02,515 --> 00:50:05,310
We love that Ray Liotta
carries his Emmy around.

772
00:50:05,393 --> 00:50:08,688
By the way, Ray Liotta
actually does have an Emmy

773
00:50:08,771 --> 00:50:12,483
- for a guest spot on ER in 2005.
- He corrected us while recording.

774
00:50:12,567 --> 00:50:14,903
- We didn't make that up.
- It's true.

775
00:50:14,986 --> 00:50:20,325
- This guy is a fantastic comedy actor.
- Comedy actor, dramatic actor...

776
00:50:20,408 --> 00:50:23,578
- And a great sport.
- Great sport. Really.

777
00:50:23,661 --> 00:50:27,832
What kind of outrageous show business
crime is it that he doesn't have

778
00:50:27,916 --> 00:50:30,585
- an Oscar for Goodfellas?
- It is.

779
00:50:30,668 --> 00:50:35,298
- One of the best performances ever.
- That's why awards are you know what.

780
00:50:35,381 --> 00:50:39,260
I like when he's standing on the podium
at the end like a lunatic.

781
00:50:39,344 --> 00:50:42,096
- "Say it."
- "Say it!"

782
00:50:42,764 --> 00:50:47,310
This guy in the middle really
kind of becomes... steals the whole...

783
00:50:47,393 --> 00:50:49,896
He becomes the jury foreman,
self-appointed jury foreman.

784
00:50:49,896 --> 00:50:50,772
He becomes the jury foreman,
self-appointed jury foreman.

785
00:50:50,855 --> 00:50:53,107
- I don't like that guy.
- Security guy,

786
00:50:53,191 --> 00:50:54,943
trying to keep everybody down.

787
00:50:57,737 --> 00:51:00,573
This gets a laugh, Little Missy logo.

788
00:51:00,657 --> 00:51:04,702
At one point, Barry's gonna take that
salt next to him, put it on his pea,

789
00:51:04,786 --> 00:51:09,999
- but we never actually did that.
- Here comes that gigantic head again.

790
00:51:10,792 --> 00:51:14,671
I can't believe somehow we found a way
to work giantism into this whole

791
00:51:14,754 --> 00:51:17,465
DVD commentary.

792
00:51:17,548 --> 00:51:19,801
- Gigantism.
- Gigantism, yeah.

793
00:51:19,884 --> 00:51:22,887
- This was a joke that came in later.
- Yes.

794
00:51:22,971 --> 00:51:26,391
I couldn't let go of this tragic doomed
love triangle thing.

795
00:51:29,018 --> 00:51:31,646
Another great Patrick thing.

796
00:51:46,536 --> 00:51:49,122
- This was... Patrick was great in this.
- Yeah.

797
00:51:49,205 --> 00:51:52,333
- One of my favourite scenes.
- A lot of us, our favourite.

798
00:51:52,417 --> 00:51:55,336
I love the interplay
between the two of them.

799
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,046
That little...

800
00:51:58,047 --> 00:52:00,592
- Patrick's great.
- Yeah.

801
00:52:00,675 --> 00:52:03,386
To me, what I love about this movie,

802
00:52:03,469 --> 00:52:06,890
is that he has got himself,
in his life, this Ken,

803
00:52:06,973 --> 00:52:10,143
in a problem where a bee
is trying to steal his girl.

804
00:52:10,226 --> 00:52:12,770
He thinks that. In his mind.

805
00:52:12,854 --> 00:52:16,524
You never know what happens,
but who ends up in this situation?

806
00:52:16,608 --> 00:52:19,944
- Where you've got an insect...
- Dating your girlfriend.

807
00:52:20,028 --> 00:52:22,447
- What I like.
- Talking, now having dinner.

808
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:26,910
He's just trying to fill a resume out
at Kinko's, now he's got this problem.

809
00:52:26,993 --> 00:52:30,455
Who figures an insect is gonna derail

810
00:52:30,538 --> 00:52:33,708
their relationship, their career?

811
00:52:33,791 --> 00:52:36,461
I love Barry picking
the piece of paper up.

812
00:52:36,544 --> 00:52:40,381
Barry taking the reading material,
and being able to close the door.

813
00:52:40,465 --> 00:52:44,135
- Who knows how that works?
- Turn the light on, right.

814
00:52:44,218 --> 00:52:48,097
Simon and I think this
is our favourite line in the movie.

815
00:52:48,181 --> 00:52:50,892
"You know what?"

816
00:52:50,975 --> 00:52:53,478
- That take was so great.
- Which line?

817
00:52:53,561 --> 00:52:56,773
He comes in the bathroom
and says, "You know what?"

818
00:52:56,856 --> 00:53:00,109
He's happy that he's finally
got a reason to kill him.

819
00:53:00,193 --> 00:53:03,696
He's got the excuse he needed,
in his mind. A clear conscience.

820
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:06,115
- Barry Marder moment's coming up.
- Yeah!

821
00:53:06,199 --> 00:53:10,078
- Anticipation for that.
- Look at texture on that toilet paper.

822
00:53:15,708 --> 00:53:19,003
- This is where...
- Yeah, I remember that took a while.

823
00:53:20,380 --> 00:53:23,007
I remember fighting with the enemy.

824
00:53:23,091 --> 00:53:26,177
- Guy gets hit on the head 64 times.
- Oh, Barry.

825
00:53:33,059 --> 00:53:35,436
- Bravo!
- Very nice.

826
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,231
See, there's no here.

827
00:53:38,314 --> 00:53:39,899
- No what?
- No word "here".

828
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:41,985
It's "Water bug. Not taking sides".

829
00:53:42,068 --> 00:53:45,863
- Doesn't say "Not taking sides here".
- Write up a cheque for $5.60.

830
00:53:45,947 --> 00:53:49,659
- Send it to Barry's apartment.
- I like when he says "blue water".

831
00:53:49,742 --> 00:53:51,327
It's "poo water".

832
00:53:51,411 --> 00:53:53,830
- I thought it was "blue water".
- Poo water!

833
00:53:53,913 --> 00:53:56,833
- Poo water.
- Let me hear that again.

834
00:53:56,916 --> 00:53:58,668
- No.
- Coming up.

835
00:54:02,589 --> 00:54:05,049
- See?
- Who'd go, "Blue water"?

836
00:54:05,133 --> 00:54:09,012
- Blue water's a toilet bowl refresher.
- True.

837
00:54:09,095 --> 00:54:12,473
- The Tidy Bowl.
- What sick relationship is this?

838
00:54:12,557 --> 00:54:14,058
Which one?

839
00:54:14,893 --> 00:54:18,521
Everybody here take one step
to the right for a sick relationship.

840
00:54:18,605 --> 00:54:23,401
Girl likes bee, bee likes girl.
This guy's trying to steal my baby.

841
00:54:26,154 --> 00:54:29,949
- This was another late addition.
- Yes, one of my favourite moments.

842
00:54:30,033 --> 00:54:32,410
- So funny.
- Two exits or three?

843
00:54:32,493 --> 00:54:34,871
- Three.
- Two comebacks.

844
00:54:34,954 --> 00:54:39,334
This is always one of the best scenes
that we've always had in the movie.

845
00:54:39,417 --> 00:54:41,002
This is one of the longest.

846
00:55:12,283 --> 00:55:14,327
- This was a tough one.
- It was.

847
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:18,581
- But you always, Jerry, had wanted...
- I wanted John Goodman for this.

848
00:55:24,629 --> 00:55:25,880
This guy's great too, Sammy Davis Juror.

849
00:55:25,880 --> 00:55:28,091
This guy's great too, Sammy Davis Juror.

850
00:55:28,174 --> 00:55:31,552
- Sammy Davis Juror.
- Sammy Davis Juror.

851
00:55:31,636 --> 00:55:35,223
- Another obese guy in the back.
- Montgomery with a moustache.

852
00:55:35,306 --> 00:55:38,309
- Let's be honest.
- Not much variation you can get.

853
00:55:38,393 --> 00:55:41,312
Not Montgomery.
There's a bunch of crowd guys we had.

854
00:55:41,396 --> 00:55:43,648
Every other human has a weight problem.

855
00:55:43,731 --> 00:55:48,987
But what kind of huge food company
executive has a Frito Bandito moustache?

856
00:55:50,613 --> 00:55:53,283
Going into the moustaches.

857
00:55:53,366 --> 00:55:56,744
- Our moustache problem.
- Facial hair taken out of the movie.

858
00:55:56,828 --> 00:55:58,997
Still, quite a bit remains.

859
00:55:59,080 --> 00:56:03,585
- Everybody had a moustache.
- Why do we need liver spots?

860
00:56:03,668 --> 00:56:07,088
- Is that helping anybody?
- It's realistic.

861
00:56:52,842 --> 00:56:55,887
- Here's your buttocks scene you...
- Here it comes.

862
00:56:55,970 --> 00:56:58,681
- This is in full glory here.
- Prepare for this.

863
00:56:58,765 --> 00:57:02,268
- This is very unappealing.
- This is full glory here.

864
00:57:02,352 --> 00:57:05,146
I know, but it's unappealing
in an appealing way.

865
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:08,066
- In an appealing way?
- They're trying to make it

866
00:57:08,149 --> 00:57:11,069
an attractive derriere
in a gigantic size.

867
00:57:11,152 --> 00:57:15,114
I wanna be honest. Someone
in America will find that attractive.

868
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:16,324
Here, look at this.

869
00:57:17,784 --> 00:57:19,953
I think that's fantastic.

870
00:57:20,036 --> 00:57:23,748
- I love the little twitches.
- Yeah.

871
00:57:23,831 --> 00:57:28,211
- People seem to like that tableau.
- Look at the newscaster and nurse.

872
00:57:28,294 --> 00:57:31,381
- Same face, character.
- Newscaster is Carol Leifer.

873
00:57:31,464 --> 00:57:36,594
Right, Carol Leifer, good friend
of mine. Talented comedian and writer.

874
00:57:36,678 --> 00:57:39,222
- I love this music.
- This music is fantastic.

875
00:57:39,305 --> 00:57:44,102
Did it in one take.
One take, one whole take. Phenomenal.

876
00:57:52,318 --> 00:57:56,197
That got a good laugh,
him hitting the clicker thing.

877
00:57:56,281 --> 00:57:59,534
Look at the drooping antenna
'cause he's not feeling well.

878
00:57:59,617 --> 00:58:03,288
- And little magazines.
- Graded him less than Barry, he's ill.

879
00:58:03,371 --> 00:58:08,042
- The end of the scene, he gets better.
- A little perkier.

880
00:58:08,126 --> 00:58:10,003
This is great.

881
00:58:11,337 --> 00:58:16,467
We also had a flea circus here
along with a roach motel.

882
00:58:16,551 --> 00:58:21,180
- Which I always liked.
- What was it? Flea circus, roach motel?

883
00:58:21,264 --> 00:58:23,975
- Ant farms.
- Flea circuses, ant farms.

884
00:58:24,058 --> 00:58:26,436
"Ant farms,
flea circuses, roach motels,

885
00:58:26,519 --> 00:58:29,314
they're capable of anything."
Never got a laugh.

886
00:58:29,397 --> 00:58:33,192
- "Look what they did to fleas."
- "Look what they did to fleas."

887
00:58:45,747 --> 00:58:49,667
- That gets a big laugh.
- That's what remains of that

888
00:58:49,751 --> 00:58:51,711
three-partjoke.

889
00:58:53,212 --> 00:58:56,132
- The smoke is a good effect.
- It is, it's great.

890
00:58:56,215 --> 00:58:59,469
- Perfect. Subtle.
- This is where we make our anti-smoking

891
00:58:59,552 --> 00:59:03,765
- statement.
- You can smoke into a hospital room.

892
00:59:04,807 --> 00:59:07,477
- You wouldn't think.
- They used to be doctors.

893
00:59:07,560 --> 00:59:09,896
- Right.
- Smoking outside the window.

894
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:12,649
- That was too real.
- Considering the size of the

895
00:59:12,732 --> 00:59:16,653
medical assistants, how heavy they are,
when they swivel around.

896
00:59:16,736 --> 00:59:21,366
In the meantime, they don't look
in the window and go, "Is that two bees

897
00:59:21,449 --> 00:59:25,912
in one of our hospital rooms?
What the hell's going on in this place?"

898
00:59:27,080 --> 00:59:29,040
- This worked.
- Yeah.

899
00:59:30,041 --> 00:59:33,920
- That guy is very proud in the back.
- Yeah. The guy making the boat.

900
00:59:34,003 --> 00:59:35,129
Puttering along.

901
00:59:35,213 --> 00:59:38,591
- They could have gone...
- You questioned the bee thing once.

902
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:41,427
- That was the MetLife jacket thing.
- Right.

903
00:59:41,511 --> 00:59:44,472
When I said that, you said...
You got mad, berated me,

904
00:59:44,556 --> 00:59:48,935
and said a bee wouldn't wear a Metlife
jacket. I went, "The bee attorney?"

905
00:59:55,233 --> 00:59:56,901
This is a sight gag

906
00:59:56,985 --> 01:00:00,780
- that came out later in the process.
- Where is Montgomery's jacket?

907
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:05,743
- Why is he not wearing a jacket?
- He couldn't do it with the seat.

908
01:00:05,827 --> 01:00:08,663
- We couldn't make it work.
- That thing on his neck.

909
01:00:08,746 --> 01:00:12,166
It looks like he's been to hospital
and had some problems.

910
01:00:29,851 --> 01:00:34,689
This whole structure here of having no
smoking gun was Steve Hickner's idea.

911
01:00:34,772 --> 01:00:40,361
Having Barry produce the gun and come
in. That really was a great addition.

912
01:00:40,445 --> 01:00:43,489
- The smoking gun.
- How did we not think of that sooner?

913
01:00:43,573 --> 01:00:48,036
- It used to be the queen.
- Every good idea seems so obvious.

914
01:00:48,119 --> 01:00:50,788
- How could you not do it?
- How you know it's good.

915
01:00:50,872 --> 01:00:53,708
We eradicated the bees
eight times in this movie.

916
01:00:53,791 --> 01:00:57,629
That way that guy
slides across the table,

917
01:00:57,712 --> 01:01:01,799
if you watch the way his eyes
go from side to side,

918
01:01:01,883 --> 01:01:06,304
the way he... See? The little grimace
he does with his teeth,

919
01:01:06,387 --> 01:01:10,141
you have to work
on that whole little thing.

920
01:01:10,225 --> 01:01:15,063
That other little gesture, that's
from my sitcom, that Newman thing

921
01:01:15,146 --> 01:01:18,524
we used to do. I used to go, "Newman!"

922
01:01:21,194 --> 01:01:25,406
Barry, why don't you talk for a second
about why you like that line

923
01:01:25,490 --> 01:01:29,160
when Montgomery
comes over to Barry and says,

924
01:01:29,244 --> 01:01:33,414
"You'll regret this, Benson.
This is an unholy perversion

925
01:01:33,498 --> 01:01:36,251
of the balance of nature.
You'll regret this."

926
01:01:36,334 --> 01:01:41,256
Talk a little bit about what that line
does in terms of the story structure

927
01:01:41,339 --> 01:01:43,174
of the movie.

928
01:01:50,723 --> 01:01:54,561
I like that line because, to me,
what's funny about this movie,

929
01:01:54,644 --> 01:01:58,398
the big core funny thing
is that a bug would sue a human.

930
01:01:58,481 --> 01:02:02,151
It's like a cockroach suing
a construction worker.

931
01:02:02,235 --> 01:02:05,238
When you get that in there...
He comes over and says,

932
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:10,201
"This is gonna throw off the balance",
that is something I didn't expect

933
01:02:10,285 --> 01:02:14,747
in this movie. It takes that movie
from being a funny movie

934
01:02:14,831 --> 01:02:19,127
to, "There's a real problem
that could happen here", you know?

935
01:02:19,210 --> 01:02:24,632
And itjust hit me like...
This went to...

936
01:02:24,716 --> 01:02:28,428
In a good screenplay,
it's get that character up a tree,

937
01:02:28,511 --> 01:02:31,222
- then you got to get him down.
- Right.

938
01:02:32,265 --> 01:02:38,062
This sequence is the best it's been
because we had it like a smorgasbord

939
01:02:38,146 --> 01:02:40,481
of events happening
on top of each other.

940
01:02:40,565 --> 01:02:43,568
- Then was it Steven?
- It was Steven.

941
01:02:43,651 --> 01:02:46,613
- He split the two things up.
- Tell this story.

942
01:02:46,696 --> 01:02:50,992
The flowers dying first
and then the bees not working second.

943
01:02:51,075 --> 01:02:55,330
Collecting the honey, the flowers dying,
and then bees chilling out.

944
01:02:55,413 --> 01:02:59,250
- We had it...
- We had them all...

945
01:02:59,334 --> 01:03:03,838
Many times, we tried to make it work.
I think the way it is now, obviously,

946
01:03:03,922 --> 01:03:07,133
is the honey is rounded up,
they collect all the honey,

947
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:10,720
then they stop working
because they don't need any more honey.

948
01:03:10,803 --> 01:03:13,348
They stop working,
the flowers start dying.

949
01:03:13,431 --> 01:03:15,642
- Really clear.
- It's cause and effect.

950
01:03:15,725 --> 01:03:19,187
- Cause and effect. We didn't have that.
- Jumbled it together.

951
01:03:19,270 --> 01:03:21,940
We tried to make it work
and it wasn't blending.

952
01:03:22,023 --> 01:03:25,610
One of your great ideas, Jerry,
was putting them sunbathing.

953
01:03:25,693 --> 01:03:30,156
Somehow that says idleness.
We never could get that visual.

954
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:34,786
- It's not total boredom.
- "Gallons more's coming".

955
01:03:34,869 --> 01:03:38,623
"Gallons more's coming".
That was Dave Herman.

956
01:03:38,706 --> 01:03:41,751
It was his first take of that line.
He screwed it up.

957
01:03:41,834 --> 01:03:44,879
He said "more's" instead
of "Gallons more coming".

958
01:03:44,963 --> 01:03:47,590
We thought it was funny
so we left it in.

959
01:03:47,674 --> 01:03:50,677
I love the James Bond-style music.

960
01:03:50,760 --> 01:03:52,929
- The War Games moment.
- Yeah.

961
01:03:53,012 --> 01:03:56,224
- Yeah, a little...
- For Matthew's fans.

962
01:03:56,307 --> 01:04:00,186
- I like the way they move here.
- I love the music here too.

963
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:05,191
- I like the way it becomes a TV image.
- The guy looks like The Village People.

964
01:04:10,822 --> 01:04:14,325
I never noticed the Honex corporate
shirt that guy was wearing.

965
01:04:14,409 --> 01:04:16,536
- I love this scene.
- I love this scene.

966
01:04:16,619 --> 01:04:20,039
Saw that the first time last night.
The way it was animated...

967
01:04:20,123 --> 01:04:23,084
- Which one?
- They're in the chaise lounges.

968
01:04:23,167 --> 01:04:26,379
- It's chaise, by the way.
- Chave lounge?

969
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:29,257
Ever say it again,
which I doubt, but if you ever do.

970
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:32,760
I love this effect.
They thought this was gonna be hard.

971
01:04:32,844 --> 01:04:35,221
This is a huge,
fantastic thing they did.

972
01:04:35,305 --> 01:04:37,640
- Chevy Chase would be...
- The day-night?

973
01:04:37,724 --> 01:04:42,437
The day-night is a huge thing.
Everybody did a fantastic job on it.

974
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:45,356
There's so many huge undertakings
in this movie.

975
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:49,235
- That's something Nick put in.
- Nick put that in.

976
01:04:55,950 --> 01:05:00,330
- Adam growing a quarter of an inch?
- Yeah.

977
01:05:01,039 --> 01:05:03,207
Adam looks awfully big there.

978
01:05:03,291 --> 01:05:06,085
- Just the camera.
- It's perspective, Barry.

979
01:05:06,169 --> 01:05:09,213
He's growing a quarter inch a scene.

980
01:05:09,297 --> 01:05:13,426
Remember when the sword was missing
in some scenes?

981
01:05:13,509 --> 01:05:16,429
- Yes, he did know.
- I didn't realise it,

982
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:20,892
and then I was upset we were putting it
in. I thought, "The joke is over."

983
01:05:20,975 --> 01:05:23,811
- No, you can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

984
01:05:23,895 --> 01:05:25,438
- No.
- No one cares.

985
01:05:25,521 --> 01:05:29,275
Guy gets in a fight in live action,
how long do you keep the Band-Aid?

986
01:05:29,359 --> 01:05:31,277
Some of them, all the way.

987
01:05:31,361 --> 01:05:34,656
- Matthew's really good in that scene.
- Yeah.

988
01:05:34,739 --> 01:05:38,743
- The animation was lovely.
- Let me ask why so much blue.

989
01:05:38,826 --> 01:05:42,956
Because it's a good, complementary
colour with orange and yellow?

990
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,416
- Technology-based.
- I like the colour.

991
01:05:45,500 --> 01:05:50,380
What does that mean?
That's the BS that they throw at you.

992
01:05:50,463 --> 01:05:53,800
- It's a great complement.
- Complementary to orange.

993
01:05:53,883 --> 01:05:56,886
- Sherwin-Williams talk.
- Technology within honey.

994
01:05:56,970 --> 01:06:00,098
- Is that latex-based?
- It's laboratorial.

995
01:06:00,181 --> 01:06:02,016
- Laboratorial?
- Is that a word?

996
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:04,060
- No.
- What are you, Boris Karloff?

997
01:06:04,143 --> 01:06:07,438
I went into a laboratory,
I wouldn't go, "Where's the blue?"

998
01:06:07,522 --> 01:06:11,234
In terms of colours, when you test,
blue means the future.

999
01:06:11,317 --> 01:06:13,653
The bees have been around a long time.

1000
01:06:13,736 --> 01:06:17,615
- You got a mood ring at home?
- The white was too starched.

1001
01:06:17,699 --> 01:06:22,120
- Blue's future.
- Simon, who made up those rules?

1002
01:06:22,203 --> 01:06:25,540
- No, it's not.
- I thought black was high-tech.

1003
01:06:25,623 --> 01:06:28,418
- And silver.
- Any colour you want to be high-tech

1004
01:06:28,501 --> 01:06:31,004
- is high-tech.
- The great thing about this

1005
01:06:31,087 --> 01:06:34,257
is it's very moving,
but we also got in two greatjokes.

1006
01:06:34,340 --> 01:06:35,967
Yeah.

1007
01:06:37,802 --> 01:06:42,265
- Renée, I love in this scene.
- Here's where you have the movie.

1008
01:06:42,348 --> 01:06:44,517
Yeah, she's really good here.

1009
01:06:47,228 --> 01:06:51,149
- That got a big laugh.
- That was a great laugh last night.

1010
01:06:51,232 --> 01:06:55,194
This thing with the suicide pact,

1011
01:06:55,278 --> 01:06:59,324
and this was Morgan...
What's his last name?

1012
01:06:59,407 --> 01:07:00,825
- Kelly.
- Morgan Kelly.

1013
01:07:00,909 --> 01:07:03,703
One of my favourite laughs.
It's hard to get a laugh

1014
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:09,000
off of something this small.
When she says, "That kills you twice",

1015
01:07:09,083 --> 01:07:11,711
and he does that little thing
on his lip.

1016
01:07:11,794 --> 01:07:15,965
The reason you laugh
is the acting is so good.

1017
01:07:16,049 --> 01:07:18,801
The way people would say "right".

1018
01:07:18,885 --> 01:07:22,222
Does any bee wear
a short-sleeve shirt with buttons?

1019
01:07:22,305 --> 01:07:24,599
- All sweaters?
- They wear polo shirts.

1020
01:07:24,682 --> 01:07:28,019
- Polo shirts.
- I love that two-shot as well.

1021
01:07:28,102 --> 01:07:30,313
- I do too.
- If you think about that,

1022
01:07:30,396 --> 01:07:34,609
of where would you put the camera
to get the bee and the girl in the shot,

1023
01:07:34,692 --> 01:07:39,530
- it's great.
- This is a scene that we boarded

1024
01:07:39,614 --> 01:07:42,533
and it really never changed
in three years.

1025
01:07:55,380 --> 01:08:00,551
That line there, "I had to open my mouth
and talk", that's the most sincere

1026
01:08:00,635 --> 01:08:03,763
I've ever done anything
in the show business industry.

1027
01:08:03,846 --> 01:08:06,558
- I actually had to be sincere.
- Was that hard?

1028
01:08:06,641 --> 01:08:10,019
- So hard and uncomfortable.
- It was hard to get it out of you.

1029
01:08:10,103 --> 01:08:13,273
- I just hated it.
- So you were never sincere?

1030
01:08:13,356 --> 01:08:17,277
Yeah, it works, but it was excruciating.
Like a needle at the doctor.

1031
01:08:17,360 --> 01:08:21,155
- That bad to be sincere?
- You said, "You need to be sincere

1032
01:08:21,239 --> 01:08:23,783
when you say
'I had to open my mouth and talk."'

1033
01:08:23,866 --> 01:08:26,661
Like pulling your pants down
and getting the shot

1034
01:08:26,744 --> 01:08:28,621
from the doctor when you're a kid.

1035
01:08:28,705 --> 01:08:31,207
- You gotta mean it.
- I gotta mean this?

1036
01:08:31,291 --> 01:08:35,837
I've done very well
in 31 years of comedy

1037
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,047
without being sincere once.

1038
01:08:38,131 --> 01:08:40,967
Then I ran into this problem.

1039
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:45,346
- Well, it worked.
- I had to. I was caught.

1040
01:09:02,071 --> 01:09:06,451
Should we talk about the great actors
that are not in the film that recorded?

1041
01:09:06,534 --> 01:09:08,912
- Yeah.
- Eric Idle did a wonderful performance.

1042
01:09:08,912 --> 01:09:09,996
- Yeah.
- Eric Idle did a wonderful performance.

1043
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:13,082
- He narrated the movie.
- He's a world expert on bees.

1044
01:09:13,166 --> 01:09:16,294
World's foremost bee expert,
but he missed the talking.

1045
01:09:16,377 --> 01:09:18,796
- That was Eric Idle.
- Played by Eric Idle.

1046
01:09:18,880 --> 01:09:24,802
In the end of that movie,
his plan was he wanted to be the first

1047
01:09:24,886 --> 01:09:30,266
bee king by transplanting
his head onto Barry's body

1048
01:09:30,350 --> 01:09:34,354
with some sort of machine he had
fashioned by watching The Fly

1049
01:09:34,437 --> 01:09:37,482
with Jeff Goldblum in 1986
over and over again.

1050
01:09:37,565 --> 01:09:42,737
He called it a Goldblum Machine. He
wanted to lure Barry into this chamber

1051
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:46,866
and remove his head
and put the Willingham head

1052
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:50,203
on Barry's head. Then he would
be the first king of the bees.

1053
01:09:50,286 --> 01:09:52,664
- And was so good.
- Steve Landesberg.

1054
01:09:52,747 --> 01:09:55,792
People are like,
"Why did you take him out? Why?"

1055
01:09:55,875 --> 01:09:59,545
Believe me, folks, we didn't want to,
but it's a tricky thing

1056
01:09:59,629 --> 01:10:02,507
when you're telling a story...
You can have...

1057
01:10:02,590 --> 01:10:06,970
I really fell prey to it...
you know, all the time.

1058
01:10:07,053 --> 01:10:11,182
Going off on detours and tangents
that had nothing to do with anything,

1059
01:10:11,266 --> 01:10:13,351
butjust things I thought were funny.

1060
01:10:13,434 --> 01:10:17,522
And when you play it for an audience,
we'd do test screenings,

1061
01:10:17,605 --> 01:10:21,526
the audience would get lost, confused.
They'd lose track of the film.

1062
01:10:21,609 --> 01:10:24,737
They end up not liking the movie
because they didn't know

1063
01:10:24,821 --> 01:10:27,782
- what the story was about.
- We had to stay with Barry.

1064
01:10:27,865 --> 01:10:31,327
The minute you deviated from that,
it never worked.

1065
01:10:31,411 --> 01:10:35,331
Once you didn't stay on his
point of view, they lost focus.

1066
01:10:35,415 --> 01:10:38,793
- Didn't know what to care about.
- It was frustrating for me

1067
01:10:38,876 --> 01:10:42,839
because I'm not interested in the story.
I'd rather just make jokes.

1068
01:10:42,922 --> 01:10:46,718
- We found that out.
- Tell them what really happened.

1069
01:10:46,801 --> 01:10:50,847
The biggest problem we had
in the story structure of the movie

1070
01:10:50,930 --> 01:10:53,808
was the end of the trial,
Barry wins the trial,

1071
01:10:53,892 --> 01:10:58,104
always kind of felt like the end
of the movie. It let the air out...

1072
01:10:58,187 --> 01:11:01,566
There was no more tension.
Problem solved, movie over.

1073
01:11:01,649 --> 01:11:06,696
We didn't want to do that traditional
structure where you end with the trial.

1074
01:11:06,779 --> 01:11:10,325
Somebody made the point to me
that it's very unusual

1075
01:11:10,408 --> 01:11:13,453
that the big trial scene
is in the middle of the movie.

1076
01:11:13,536 --> 01:11:16,331
- It's always at the end.
- Always.

1077
01:11:16,414 --> 01:11:20,460
- That's fresh then.
- So one of the ways we had to solve

1078
01:11:20,543 --> 01:11:25,089
the problem is the second he wins
the trial, Montgomery comes over

1079
01:11:25,173 --> 01:11:28,843
and warns him that this is gonna
have a bad consequence.

1080
01:11:28,927 --> 01:11:31,721
Here comes one of my favourite lines.

1081
01:11:34,349 --> 01:11:36,601
- "I'm an attorney!"
- I love that line.

1082
01:11:36,684 --> 01:11:38,311
We had a few different lines

1083
01:11:38,394 --> 01:11:42,315
that Barry would say
when he's on the bald guy's head,

1084
01:11:42,398 --> 01:11:45,235
so the guy doesn't attack him.
Trying to explain,

1085
01:11:45,318 --> 01:11:49,197
"I'm notjust a bee.
I'm talking, I'm on your side."

1086
01:11:49,280 --> 01:11:55,411
So one of them was "I'm an attorney".
One was "I'm a frequent flier member".

1087
01:11:55,495 --> 01:11:58,915
- Miles plus.
- The guy said, "Who isn't?"

1088
01:11:58,998 --> 01:12:04,087
You know who I bumped into at lunch?
Hans Zimmer's good friend Jim Brooks.

1089
01:12:04,170 --> 01:12:07,006
- Really?
- We had a nice chat.

1090
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:11,135
He's a lovely guy. He's the creator
of The Mary Tyler Moore Show

1091
01:12:11,219 --> 01:12:13,805
and As Good As It Gets.

1092
01:12:13,888 --> 01:12:16,933
- Terms of Endearment.
- Very involved in The Simpsons.

1093
01:12:17,016 --> 01:12:19,018
The Simpsons as well.

1094
01:12:19,102 --> 01:12:22,105
He was very curious...

1095
01:12:24,107 --> 01:12:29,862
...about my experience of the
animation process and, you know...

1096
01:12:30,863 --> 01:12:34,742
...how uncomfortable it gets
when you think you can change something

1097
01:12:34,826 --> 01:12:37,704
at a certain stage
and then find out you can't.

1098
01:12:37,787 --> 01:12:40,331
- You experienced that.
- The two...

1099
01:12:40,415 --> 01:12:44,460
He was also a big fan of our TV juniors
that we made for NBC.

1100
01:12:44,544 --> 01:12:47,505
- Really? Has he been watching?
- Yeah.

1101
01:12:47,589 --> 01:12:51,634
He asked me if he could get a DVD
of all of them together.

1102
01:12:51,718 --> 01:12:54,887
- I can get it for him later. Not now.
- Jim Brooks.

1103
01:12:54,971 --> 01:12:57,765
No one ever gets anything
for anybody on the spot.

1104
01:12:57,849 --> 01:13:01,060
- What about Jim Brooks?
- Barry was asking Hans Zimmer.

1105
01:13:01,144 --> 01:13:05,899
- I said I think you mean Jim Brooks.
- Who's a fan of what?

1106
01:13:05,982 --> 01:13:09,193
- Jim is a fan of the TV juniors.
- No one's a fan of anything.

1107
01:13:09,277 --> 01:13:12,947
I like Hans Zimmer's name.
Sounds like a musical instrument.

1108
01:13:13,031 --> 01:13:16,117
Well... it's somewhat appropriate.

1109
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:19,537
- He blew a Hans Zimmer the other day.
- A marzipan cookie

1110
01:13:19,621 --> 01:13:22,749
- you'd buy in Europe.
- Also somewhat appropriate.

1111
01:13:22,832 --> 01:13:25,460
- Would you like a Hans Zimmer?
- Yeah.

1112
01:13:25,543 --> 01:13:28,421
It's very good with coffee at 4.00.

1113
01:13:28,504 --> 01:13:31,883
A perfect teatime accompaniment.

1114
01:13:41,309 --> 01:13:44,646
- A bit more sincerity.
- This was another sincere moment.

1115
01:13:44,729 --> 01:13:47,398
- Alert. Here we go.
- It still wasn't as hard

1116
01:13:47,482 --> 01:13:50,777
as "I had to open my mouth and talk".
That was really...

1117
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:53,738
- Yeah, that was a tough one.
- That was really...

1118
01:13:53,821 --> 01:13:55,865
- I like this.
- There's the Whee-Lo.

1119
01:13:55,949 --> 01:13:58,451
- People loved those...
- Yesterday.

1120
01:13:58,534 --> 01:14:00,370
...hexagonal cards.
- Right.

1121
01:14:00,453 --> 01:14:02,789
...Hawaiian shirt.
- There it is, Barry.

1122
01:14:02,872 --> 01:14:05,375
- Black and yellow hello.
- I got it in there.

1123
01:14:05,458 --> 01:14:09,295
- He tried for a year to put get it in.
- We tried to get an ad campaign.

1124
01:14:09,379 --> 01:14:12,131
This is another heavy blue...
Why is this so blue?

1125
01:14:12,215 --> 01:14:13,967
Very high-tech.

1126
01:14:14,050 --> 01:14:16,719
- Why is this all blue?
- Jerry, it's the future.

1127
01:14:16,803 --> 01:14:18,972
- They sky is blue.
- Blue is the future.

1128
01:14:19,055 --> 01:14:23,518
The auto-pilot is blue.
Her chair is blue. I don't get it.

1129
01:14:23,601 --> 01:14:27,981
- Blue is the animator future colour.
- It's a storm. They're in danger.

1130
01:14:28,064 --> 01:14:31,693
- It's cool!
- Can you hear this crap, folks?

1131
01:14:31,776 --> 01:14:34,612
This is what they say
when you're working on a movie.

1132
01:14:34,696 --> 01:14:37,240
You say, "That doesn't look right."
They say,

1133
01:14:37,323 --> 01:14:41,619
- "This is an animation thing we do."
- You wanna know they're in danger.

1134
01:14:41,703 --> 01:14:46,040
Blue meant technology.
Now it means danger.

1135
01:14:46,124 --> 01:14:49,294
- I thought red meant danger.
- Is there anything else?

1136
01:14:49,377 --> 01:14:52,839
- Please write it down.
- The BS flies fast and furious

1137
01:14:52,922 --> 01:14:56,676
around these parts.
Whatever we need to shut you up,

1138
01:14:56,759 --> 01:14:59,053
that's what it is.

1139
01:14:59,137 --> 01:15:01,556
- More blue for you.
- Yeah, more blue.

1140
01:15:01,639 --> 01:15:04,976
- The whole damn thing is blue.
- We need a Sherwin-Williams.

1141
01:15:05,059 --> 01:15:07,312
It's pretty. That's an answer.

1142
01:15:07,395 --> 01:15:09,647
I know it looks fake, but it's pretty.

1143
01:15:09,731 --> 01:15:11,941
- It's not fake.
- You're not treating me

1144
01:15:12,025 --> 01:15:14,027
- like an idiot.
- I love this moment,

1145
01:15:14,110 --> 01:15:16,654
the slapping we never thought
was gonna work.

1146
01:15:16,738 --> 01:15:19,157
It kills. Travolta gets a big laugh too.

1147
01:15:19,240 --> 01:15:21,492
- A big laugh.
- The idea that a human hand

1148
01:15:21,576 --> 01:15:25,246
could even hit a bee in the face
so flush that it would make

1149
01:15:25,330 --> 01:15:28,124
- a sound like that.
- A leap of faith.

1150
01:15:28,207 --> 01:15:31,669
You never could see it
until it was fully executed.

1151
01:15:31,753 --> 01:15:35,256
- Right.
- Here's that Bogart type of thing

1152
01:15:35,340 --> 01:15:37,342
that Barry gets to do.

1153
01:15:39,385 --> 01:15:42,263
Did Barry come with us to Phoenix?
He missed that.

1154
01:15:42,347 --> 01:15:45,183
- He missed that fateful day.
- Yeah, Barry.

1155
01:15:45,266 --> 01:15:49,687
I think the last credit in the film
belongs to Chris Bianco.

1156
01:15:49,771 --> 01:15:53,233
Of Phoenix, Arizona
who was our good friend.

1157
01:15:53,316 --> 01:15:58,947
And he's master... He's a pizza master.
He has a pizzeria in Phoenix called

1158
01:15:59,030 --> 01:16:02,784
Pizzeria Bianco.
It's the best pizza in the world.

1159
01:16:02,867 --> 01:16:05,286
- Including Italy.
- Beyond the best pizza.

1160
01:16:05,370 --> 01:16:08,373
- Phenomenal.
- He's a wonderful guy, good friend.

1161
01:16:08,456 --> 01:16:11,793
We went there to celebrate
the end of the movie.

1162
01:16:11,876 --> 01:16:14,379
It's called a wrap party
in the business.

1163
01:16:14,462 --> 01:16:16,756
I guess maybe eight or ten of us went.

1164
01:16:16,839 --> 01:16:19,634
We flew to Phoenix
and had pizza there that day.

1165
01:16:19,717 --> 01:16:23,221
We gave him a credit at the end
because we love his pizza so much.

1166
01:16:23,304 --> 01:16:29,102
Pizza Consultant, Chris Bianco. Barry,
who knows a good meal when he sees it...

1167
01:16:29,185 --> 01:16:32,021
What, are you insulting me?

1168
01:16:32,105 --> 01:16:36,192
...stayed in town for some meetings
that will change the course of rivers.

1169
01:16:36,276 --> 01:16:39,279
- Meetings?
- You were there the first time we went.

1170
01:16:39,362 --> 01:16:42,657
- I've never been there.
- The bee looks big here.

1171
01:16:42,740 --> 01:16:45,994
It's camera angle.
He's close to the lens, she's far away.

1172
01:16:46,077 --> 01:16:48,955
- It's perspective, Barry.
- Perspective.

1173
01:16:50,498 --> 01:16:52,458
Should we talk about our cameo?

1174
01:16:53,376 --> 01:16:56,045
I defer to you on that one.

1175
01:16:56,129 --> 01:16:59,257
- Who's got a cameo?
- There's a head

1176
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:02,802
of another major animation studio
that has a cameo.

1177
01:17:02,885 --> 01:17:05,013
- No!
- About here.

1178
01:17:05,096 --> 01:17:07,849
Maybe there, maybe not.

1179
01:17:12,520 --> 01:17:16,691
- This worked well.
- This was terrific.

1180
01:17:16,774 --> 01:17:19,110
This came out much better
than I thought.

1181
01:17:19,193 --> 01:17:20,987
- Good.
- Thank you.

1182
01:17:25,283 --> 01:17:28,912
I love that shot where it goes
from the monitor to the real thing.

1183
01:17:28,995 --> 01:17:30,288
Radar.

1184
01:17:31,039 --> 01:17:34,959
- I love when you say "Drop it in".
- Why do you like that?

1185
01:17:35,043 --> 01:17:36,753
It's ridiculous.

1186
01:17:36,836 --> 01:17:41,507
- That's great.
- I have my little cameo coming up.

1187
01:17:42,383 --> 01:17:46,304
Here's Christina, our producer,
on the left, and this BlackBerry.

1188
01:17:46,387 --> 01:17:49,641
- That was Ed Bradley before.
- Right.

1189
01:17:50,683 --> 01:17:52,352
- Ed Bradley's last appearance.
- Ed Bradley was who?

1190
01:17:52,352 --> 01:17:54,103
- Ed Bradley's last appearance.
- Ed Bradley was who?

1191
01:17:54,187 --> 01:17:58,274
- The guy in the background.
- Grey-bearded black guy.

1192
01:18:01,861 --> 01:18:05,198
- This was great.
- He's still got the stinger on.

1193
01:18:09,244 --> 01:18:12,038
I always love that tie that Adam wears.

1194
01:18:12,121 --> 01:18:15,375
- You like the tie.
- I tried to find one. I couldn't.

1195
01:18:15,458 --> 01:18:18,169
We should talk about the song.

1196
01:18:18,253 --> 01:18:21,172
- What song?
- Here Comes the Sun.

1197
01:18:21,256 --> 01:18:26,970
Oh, yeah. We were very excited
that The Beatles gave us the rights

1198
01:18:27,053 --> 01:18:30,723
to use their song in the movie.

1199
01:18:30,807 --> 01:18:33,810
We struggled for a long time
to come up with an ending

1200
01:18:33,893 --> 01:18:37,272
that we all felt good about.
Nick was the one who figured out

1201
01:18:37,355 --> 01:18:42,819
if we play this song through
the comedy scene in the florist,

1202
01:18:42,902 --> 01:18:47,615
you'll feel... You don't wanna feel
like the movie keeps going after this.

1203
01:18:47,699 --> 01:18:49,951
You're ready for it to end
at this stage.

1204
01:18:50,034 --> 01:18:52,579
- "Key chain" was Andy Robin's line.
- It was?

1205
01:18:52,662 --> 01:18:54,122
Yep.

1206
01:18:54,205 --> 01:18:59,836
- Then Sheryl Crow came in.
- That's a Spike Feresten joke.

1207
01:18:59,919 --> 01:19:03,172
Talk about Sheryl Crow
and what an amazing job she did.

1208
01:19:03,256 --> 01:19:06,259
Sheryl Crow sings the song,
a beautiful version.

1209
01:19:06,342 --> 01:19:08,428
- She did a greatjob.
- Really good.

1210
01:19:08,511 --> 01:19:11,514
- I like the orchestration.
- Hans came in with Rupert,

1211
01:19:11,598 --> 01:19:13,808
and they did orchestration.

1212
01:19:13,892 --> 01:19:18,980
We even had George Martin in the studio,
the famed Beatles producer, came in,

1213
01:19:19,063 --> 01:19:22,150
and listened to us do it.
Was it Abbey Road?

1214
01:19:22,233 --> 01:19:24,694
- It was at Air.
- Will that be on the album?

1215
01:19:24,777 --> 01:19:26,779
- Which is his studio.
- Should be.

1216
01:19:26,863 --> 01:19:29,073
Apparently came from his country home

1217
01:19:29,157 --> 01:19:33,786
- just to be there.
- I hope we put that original song

1218
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:36,122
on the album that you and Shaiman wrote.

1219
01:19:36,205 --> 01:19:39,208
- That will be on there as well.
- I love that song.

1220
01:19:39,292 --> 01:19:43,338
I'm sorry it's not in the movie,
in the middle of the movie.

1221
01:19:43,421 --> 01:19:45,006
- We tried.
- It never worked.

1222
01:19:45,089 --> 01:19:47,550
We all have regrets, don't we?

1223
01:19:47,634 --> 01:19:49,177
I've had a few.

1224
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:51,220
Too few to mention.

1225
01:19:53,056 --> 01:19:55,892
- That's catchy.
- Another heavy guy.

1226
01:19:57,060 --> 01:19:59,145
Another heavy guy.
It's the same guy.

1227
01:19:59,229 --> 01:20:03,566
We've got four characters. We put them
in different moustaches and shirts.

1228
01:20:03,650 --> 01:20:07,820
- The pilot is Dan...
- Don't reveal our secret.

1229
01:20:09,030 --> 01:20:10,990
It's all smoke and mirrors.

1230
01:20:12,784 --> 01:20:16,371
Columbus and 67th.
That's where I met my wife.

1231
01:20:16,454 --> 01:20:18,122
- Really?
- Yes, it is.

1232
01:20:18,206 --> 01:20:22,335
- Is that why they?
- I think it's a coincidence.

1233
01:20:24,003 --> 01:20:28,841
- But a good one.
- A great little detail for the...

1234
01:20:28,925 --> 01:20:31,719
What's this kid doing
with Larry King's glasses?

1235
01:20:31,803 --> 01:20:34,222
- And mug.
- Got four glasses, all the same.

1236
01:20:34,305 --> 01:20:36,224
We had one pair of glasses.

1237
01:20:36,307 --> 01:20:39,435
This is a great shot.
Took them a long time to do.

1238
01:20:39,519 --> 01:20:42,897
The pollen wisps. Simon,
you were working hard on those.

1239
01:20:56,452 --> 01:20:59,831
Now we can begin to talk
about the end of the movie.

1240
01:20:59,914 --> 01:21:03,084
And how many different endings we had.

1241
01:21:03,167 --> 01:21:05,920
Oh, God. This is gonna hurt a little.

1242
01:21:06,004 --> 01:21:08,464
This is ending number 150.

1243
01:21:10,466 --> 01:21:14,554
Even the cow thing showed up earlier
as a line, not a whole scene.

1244
01:21:14,637 --> 01:21:18,182
- Just as a joke.
- I love the way the bell dingles.

1245
01:21:18,266 --> 01:21:19,559
I do too.

1246
01:21:35,617 --> 01:21:39,871
- That's a big laugh at the end.
- Who could do better than Chris Rock?

1247
01:21:39,954 --> 01:21:43,625
Yeah, he's a great character.
That really came alive

1248
01:21:43,708 --> 01:21:45,752
when we got Chris Rock.

1249
01:21:46,628 --> 01:21:49,464
By the way,
you know United Airlines new slogan?

1250
01:21:49,547 --> 01:21:50,715
- What?
- Time to fly.

1251
01:21:50,798 --> 01:21:53,551
Really? That's great.

1252
01:21:53,635 --> 01:21:55,762
- Really? From this?
- Yeah.

1253
01:21:55,845 --> 01:21:59,224
Yeah, from this, Barry.
They stole it from us.

1254
01:21:59,307 --> 01:22:01,935
What happened
to "We're ready when you are"?

1255
01:22:02,018 --> 01:22:05,313
I called them up. I'm in the shower.
I'm almost ready.

1256
01:22:07,023 --> 01:22:10,360
- That was Delta, wasn't it?
- Delta's ready when you are.

1257
01:22:10,443 --> 01:22:12,946
I said, "Give me another 15 minutes."

1258
01:22:13,738 --> 01:22:16,532
For those who love stand-up
from the early '80s,

1259
01:22:16,616 --> 01:22:19,202
there's another good example of it.

1260
01:22:24,874 --> 01:22:26,542
Bravo.
