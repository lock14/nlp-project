The Perfect Holiday.[2007].DVDRIP.XVID.[Eng]-DUQA

2
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:02,612
There it is.
Oh, the first snowflake of the season.

3
00:03:05,585 --> 00:03:08,585
Come on, little fella. Come on.
That's it. That's it.

4
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:15,325
You can do it. You're almost here.
You're almost here.

5
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:20,597
Come on.

6
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:31,141
Technical definition of a snowflake
is ice crystals surrounding a particle of dirt.

7
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:39,182
lt's buttery, supple.

8
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,353
And with a clean finish.
Just like Christmas is supposed to taste.

9
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:48,692
So, technically, you are eating dirt.

10
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:52,495
-Could l get one with onions and mustard?
-Sure.

11
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:08,612
l'm sorry. l'm...

12
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:12,282
Oh! l'm sorry. Excuse me.

13
00:04:21,794 --> 00:04:24,794
Hey!

14
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:36,141
A wise man once said,
''The best Christmas present

15
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:39,142
''is a happy family all wrapped up
with each other.''

16
00:04:39,646 --> 00:04:41,146
Or maybe it was a wise woman.

17
00:04:41,147 --> 00:04:44,147
Men don't usually think that clear.
Like this guy.

18
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:48,351
He ain't had a clear thought
since he left his wife and three kids.

19
00:04:48,988 --> 00:04:51,988
He may think he has it all,
but he'll learn different, soon enough.

20
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:57,127
Now, let's move on from naughty to nice.

21
00:04:58,364 --> 00:05:01,364
<i>Meet Benjamin Armstrong,
He writes love songs,</i>

22
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:05,635
But he has yet to find
that one true love of his own,

23
00:05:08,908 --> 00:05:11,908
Merry Christmas.

24
00:05:26,092 --> 00:05:29,092
Merry Christmas.

25
00:05:43,943 --> 00:05:46,943
Did l say nice? l meant real nice.

26
00:05:49,148 --> 00:05:52,148
-Want some?
-Oh, a candy cane for me? What? Hey! Hey!

27
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:07,597
Now, over on the fancy side of town
lives Nancy Taylor.

28
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,070
She's nice, too.

29
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:15,071
As far as money goes,
she don't have a worry in the world.

30
00:06:15,241 --> 00:06:18,241
l tell you what she does fret about,
her three kids.

31
00:06:19,312 --> 00:06:22,312
She's on thejob 24/7,
Mom and dad, teacher, chauffeur, cook, cop,

32
00:06:25,651 --> 00:06:27,552
Give me that. That was mine.

33
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:30,255
She's so busy
being everything for everybody,

34
00:06:30,256 --> 00:06:33,256
there's nobody left for her,

35
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:36,795
Better watch out, girl.

36
00:06:36,796 --> 00:06:39,796
Santa's coming to town.

37
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:42,966
Next on VH1,
Behind The Music looks at J-Jizzy,

38
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:46,738
-Mom, come quick. Dad's on TV.
-Yeah, come on.

39
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:49,739
l know, l know. Your father's always on TV.
But you know what?

40
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,576
He's gonna be here, live in the flesh,
at the front door in the next five minutes,

41
00:06:53,846 --> 00:06:55,747
and you guys aren't even close
to being ready.

42
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,550
-l am.
-Me, too.

43
00:06:58,551 --> 00:07:00,852
-,,,the scandalous parties,,,
-Kind of.

44
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:03,789
-,,,is that what you want them to think?
-No, actually, that's not

45
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,190
-what I want them to think, Ronique,
-Mom. Come on.

46
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:07,959
-You see, that's only one side of me,
-One side? Try your only side.

47
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:10,495
My name may be on a lot of things,

48
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:13,496
-but the music, that's where my heart is at,
-Heart?

49
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:17,135
-In fact, I've dedicated an entire year,,,
-What heart?

50
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,371
,,,to the development
of my new Christmas CD,

51
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,372
You know, that's going to get me
spiritually closer to my fans,

52
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,876
and, of course,,,

53
00:07:24,877 --> 00:07:27,877
Which camera
are we working with here? Family,

54
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:32,682
But if family's so important,
then why your recent custody problem?

55
00:07:33,486 --> 00:07:35,020
Yeah. How about that? Why?

56
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:38,021
Ronique, I've been advised not to

57
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:41,059
comment on matters
currently under adjudication,

58
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:44,060
-Yeah, especially one's you're gonna lose.
-Mom, you're fighting with the TV again.

59
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:48,366
-Yeah.
-Yes, l am.

60
00:07:48,367 --> 00:07:50,535
But we want to spend Christmas vacation
with Dad.

61
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:51,603
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

62
00:07:51,604 --> 00:07:54,239
-Even if he's too busy to be there.
-Shut up.

63
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,240
Well, you can see him tonight,
but he's gonna be here in a hot second

64
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,079
and you guys are not even close
to being ready.

65
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,848
Please, go get your coats on.

66
00:08:02,849 --> 00:08:05,849
-And put some pants on.
-And put on some pants.

67
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,953
-No pants...
-Ain't nothing more precious to me

68
00:08:10,022 --> 00:08:13,022
than my three beautiful children,
That's right,

69
00:08:33,813 --> 00:08:36,813
Come on, guys.

70
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,987
Come on, John-John.

71
00:08:41,988 --> 00:08:44,988
You go ahead.
l'm gonna wait five more minutes.

72
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:48,892
-Just five more.
-Five minutes.

73
00:08:57,937 --> 00:09:00,937
He's coming. l know he is.

74
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:11,381
This is all a waste of time.
This is nonsense, man. Every day...

75
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:14,553
Hold on, hold on, man.
You're always thinking big, man.

76
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:16,755
You got to think big, not eat big, bro.

77
00:09:16,756 --> 00:09:19,691
Look, we're sitting out here in the cold,
waiting for this herb,

78
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:22,627
'cause you want to give him a CD?
Come on, man, we got a job.

79
00:09:22,628 --> 00:09:23,695
-Look...
-Let me tell you something.

80
00:09:23,696 --> 00:09:26,696
Once Jizzy hears my stuff, man,
he's gonna vibe to it, just like you did.

81
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:30,166
l like your songs, even the whack ones,
but this is stupid.

82
00:09:30,169 --> 00:09:33,038
Look, once he hears my music,
he's gonna put me down.

83
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:36,039
l put you down.
We all gonna come up, all right.

84
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:40,843
Yo, J! What up?
Looking good, J. What's good?

85
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,252
-You just get off me.
-Deal with you, Jizz.

86
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,221
l got a number one track. l got some
hot tracks right here for you, bro.

87
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:53,222
l got some hot tracks.
l got one right here, baby. Number one.

88
00:09:59,198 --> 00:10:02,198
J-Jizzy, what's up, man?
Ben Armstrong, man, l been calling you.

89
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:04,069
Check it out, man.
l got some hot tracks right here, man.

90
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,937
A lot of heart in these tracks, right up here.

91
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,340
-l've been doing work...
-You're not sexy, player.

92
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,841
-l know that, but...
-Sexy.

93
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:12,842
Rottweiler!

94
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:17,780
You ready to go to work now?
That's my man.

95
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,620
Get off me. Get your Jizzy Gear off me.

96
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:33,296
Where's my shoe? Where's my shoe?
Zip me up real quick. Did you zip?

97
00:10:34,266 --> 00:10:37,266
-l'm not zipped. My back is showing.
-Are you ready?

98
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:40,803
-Hey, kids, are you ready for Santa?
-Yeah!

99
00:10:42,975 --> 00:10:45,975
All righty. Santa, come out here.

100
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:55,184
-You know, l really should be Santa.
-Santa has to have a lap. You're the elf.

101
00:11:03,763 --> 00:11:06,763
Look over there.

102
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:10,667
-Okay, so, Mr. Famous didn't call again?
-Unbelievable.

103
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,605
The man will spend $50,000
to fight me in court,

104
00:11:13,606 --> 00:11:16,007
but can't spend three hours with his kids
on his regular night.

105
00:11:16,008 --> 00:11:19,008
Well, if l had to deal with that rotten rapper,
l'd be angry too.

106
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:23,980
They had three beautiful babies, Brenda.
lt couldn't have been all that bad.

107
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,750
-No, it wasn't all bad.
-Well, l wouldn't know.

108
00:11:28,287 --> 00:11:31,287
Oh, we know you wouldn't know.
At the rate you're going, you'll never know.

109
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,732
Be back in 30 minutes.

110
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,733
-l mean it.
-Look, Mommy, Santa.

111
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,504
Come on, girl,
you can't find a couple of hours

112
00:11:46,505 --> 00:11:49,505
to go to dinner with a nice man?
Even a not-so-nice man.

113
00:11:49,975 --> 00:11:51,910
Take it from us,
there's no shortage of those.

114
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:54,813
Please, it's not like l'm opposed
to finding someone.

115
00:11:54,814 --> 00:11:57,449
You know, especially someone
who's nice and likes kids

116
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,651
and isn't all about himself, you know?

117
00:11:59,652 --> 00:12:02,652
l mean, between John-John's piano lessons
and Emily's ballet and Mikey's football,

118
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:07,225
how am l supposed to even find the time
to go out on a date?

119
00:12:07,226 --> 00:12:09,394
No, seriously.
You know what l want more than anything?

120
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,529
-What?
-A compliment.

121
00:12:11,530 --> 00:12:14,299
-A compliment?
-Seriously, just a compliment.

122
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,367
-From who?
-Obviously not us.

123
00:12:16,368 --> 00:12:19,368
A man. Hello. A nice normal man
who doesn't have an agenda,

124
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:23,475
who's not trying to hook up
or get busy with me.

125
00:12:23,476 --> 00:12:25,310
You know, imagine this, right?

126
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:28,311
l'm standing in front of a store, a guy
walks by, he sees me, he doubles back

127
00:12:30,483 --> 00:12:33,483
and says, ''Wow, you look really amazing.''
And then he leaves. And that's it.

128
00:12:35,821 --> 00:12:38,821
Okay, little girl, you're next. Show time.

129
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,359
-Go and see Santa.
-Who are you?

130
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,360
-l'm Santa's number one elf.
-More like numbers one through 10.

131
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:47,398
-Nice tights.
-Tell your momma.

132
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:50,068
-Tell your momma, too.
-Here we go.

133
00:12:50,069 --> 00:12:53,069
Ho, ho, ho, little girl.
And what would you like for Christmas?

134
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,240
Besides everything.

135
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:58,241
l don't want anything for me.
Just for my mommy.

136
00:12:59,645 --> 00:13:02,645
-Really? What's your name, little girl?
-l'm Emily, and that's my mom.

137
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:10,419
-Which one is it? The one on the right?
-Yeah.

138
00:13:12,892 --> 00:13:15,892
Santa? Santa?

139
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:23,132
Yes. Yes. Yes.

140
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:26,869
See, it's like this. My mommy...

141
00:13:34,914 --> 00:13:37,914
Here, fat boy. l wrote it, you bring it.

142
00:13:39,385 --> 00:13:42,385
Don't do that. Don't do that. Don't do that.

143
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:56,032
Fine. Okay, cool.
Next time you can be Santa.

144
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:59,170
No. No, no, no, no, no.

145
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:02,006
Those kids are bad, man.
Little bunch of greedy little kids.

146
00:14:02,007 --> 00:14:03,508
Oh, man, you're telling me.

147
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,509
-See that one kid hit me?
-He hit you with the Holyfield.

148
00:14:07,813 --> 00:14:10,813
And good. Bad kid, man.

149
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:15,952
-Except for this one little girl.
-Yeah, what did she want?

150
00:14:16,622 --> 00:14:19,622
All she wanted was for some dude
to come up to her mother

151
00:14:19,892 --> 00:14:21,826
and just give her a compliment.

152
00:14:21,827 --> 00:14:24,095
Yeah, it seems like her parents split up
a few years back,

153
00:14:24,096 --> 00:14:27,096
and l guess
her mother's been real sad lately.

154
00:14:27,466 --> 00:14:30,466
-Was her momma fine?
-Well, you know, l'd have to say,

155
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:35,538
she is probably one of the most
beautiful women l think l've ever seen.

156
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,546
-Yeah.
-That should be easy.

157
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:44,082
Beautiful people get compliments
all the time.

158
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,050
l should know, l ain't never got one.

159
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:49,051
Oh, come on, man.
You're gonna find that special somebody.

160
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:53,289
-You think so?
-Okay, maybe not, but...

161
00:15:18,317 --> 00:15:21,317
Hi, l was wondering
if l could change Emily's ballet class

162
00:15:21,353 --> 00:15:22,720
to the Monday class.

163
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:25,721
l know l already changed her
from the Tuesday class to the Friday class.

164
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,960
-l was just hoping...
-Mom!

165
00:15:28,961 --> 00:15:30,561
Oh! Yes.

166
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:33,498
l can't wear this.
lt ain't got one wrinkle on it.

167
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:36,234
l'm sorry, baby, can you please turn
that music down, John-John?

168
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:37,535
Mom! Homework.

169
00:15:37,536 --> 00:15:40,536
-You need help with your math, baby?
-l think the food is ringing.

170
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:58,156
Hey, didn't l tell you
to stay out of my room?

171
00:15:58,157 --> 00:16:00,091
l was just playing.

172
00:16:00,092 --> 00:16:03,092
-Yeah, with my special toy.
-Yeah, they're all special, aren't they?

173
00:16:05,831 --> 00:16:08,032
-Who wants a story?
-l do!

174
00:16:08,033 --> 00:16:11,033
-l do.
-l don't.

175
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:14,370
-l don't.
-l still do. A Christmas story.

176
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:17,175
Okay, Christmas story coming right up.

177
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:20,176
And, Mikey, you just sort of listen,
and, John-John, just cover your ears.

178
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:28,217
-Man, Mom looks old.
-Old people are supposed to look old.

179
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:32,955
Not nasty old. But how's she gonna
get Dad back looking like that?

180
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:36,127
-l don't think she wants Daddy back.
-Sure, she does.

181
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:38,730
-She just doesn't know it yet.
-You're crazy.

182
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:41,731
Momma's beautiful,
and a nice man's gonna tell her.

183
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,334
-What man?
-The one Santa's getting her.

184
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,337
-Here it comes with the Santa stuff again.
-Come on, guys. Who wants a story?

185
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:59,448
Okay.

186
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,353
The Twelve Days of Christmas,

187
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:05,850
So what y'all think?

188
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,851
Sounds like a spiritual.
lt's like an old spiritual, boss.

189
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,090
Oh, yeah.
l'm sure all the saints was thinking,

190
00:18:15,694 --> 00:18:18,694
''Holy, holy, holy,''
with the nasty booty shaking scene.

191
00:18:19,531 --> 00:18:22,531
That's so spiritual. Yeah.

192
00:18:22,968 --> 00:18:25,968
Rottweiler! Not sexy.

193
00:18:32,244 --> 00:18:35,244
Grande cappuccino for Eric.

194
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:42,051
Well, what's this one about, light skin?
Let me guess.

195
00:18:43,255 --> 00:18:46,255
''The love l lost in the rain
in the summertime.''

196
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:50,259
How about, ''Jamal gets his butt kicked
for not letting me concentrate?''

197
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:53,629
See, that's your problem. You're not writing
songs the consumers want to hear.

198
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:58,534
We want to hear songs like...

199
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,913
-That's what people want to hear.
-Which muffin's mine, man?

200
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:14,383
None of them. You didn't pay for no muffins.

201
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:17,586
-Oh, my bad.
-Wait. You're gonna take my muffin?

202
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:20,623
You sneezed on this one, too. You know
what would be good with that song?

203
00:19:21,627 --> 00:19:24,627
lf you put a... What you looking at, man?

204
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,699
-l think that's her.
-Her who?

205
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,368
The little girl's mother from yesterday.

206
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,435
-That's her.
-Oh, yeah.

207
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:33,104
lt's the one who wants a compliment.

208
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:36,073
Give me your jacket. Give me your jacket.

209
00:19:36,074 --> 00:19:39,074
-Give me your shoe.
-Give me your jacket.

210
00:19:41,713 --> 00:19:44,713
-What you got in this jacket?
-My businesses.

211
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,828
Man!

212
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:00,829
There's a stubborn grease stain.
Do you think you can get that out?

213
00:20:03,402 --> 00:20:06,402
Excuse me. Can you put this
with the rest of my stuff?

214
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,973
You are a very attractive woman.

215
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:24,889
He said attractive?

216
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:27,890
He said l was attractive.
That's what he said, right?

217
00:20:28,694 --> 00:20:31,694
Okay.

218
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:42,640
Get out of here. What?

219
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:45,641
Yeah. A man hits on you and then leaves.
l don't buy it.

220
00:20:46,111 --> 00:20:47,545
Well, it wasn't like
he was trying to sell anything.

221
00:20:47,546 --> 00:20:50,546
He just came in, said what he said,
and then he left.

222
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,484
-What'd he look like?
-Good.

223
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,653
-So let's go and find him.
-No.

224
00:20:55,654 --> 00:20:58,289
Find him? We don't even know him.
How are we going to find him?

225
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,191
Well, how are we gonna know
unless we find him?

226
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:03,160
Yeah, okay, and then we find him,
then what?

227
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:04,862
What do you mean
you don't know his name?

228
00:21:04,863 --> 00:21:07,863
-l tell you, he no customer here.
-What about the coat he dropped off?

229
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,433
Smelly, disgusting thing?

230
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:15,004
Okay, maybe we should be looking
in a bakery.

231
00:21:15,007 --> 00:21:18,007
You guys, we should just go.

232
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:22,244
-What's wrong, man?
-Nothing. No problem.

233
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,949
Come on, man. l know you, man.
What's wrong?

234
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:27,950
Nothing. l told you, boss,
the album's good. lt's good.

235
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:29,520
Good?

236
00:21:29,521 --> 00:21:32,089
Well, you know when l say good,
l mean good in a great way.

237
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:35,090
lt's got the necessary ''G's.'' lt's got girls,
it's got gangsters, it's got Gucci.

238
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:40,829
-Yeah, but what don't it got?
-J, it just don't have no heart.

239
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
No heart? Come on, man!
l know every song on the record, okay?

240
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:49,938
Black Christmas, Three Thugs,
I Got Doodoo On My Shoe, Come on.

241
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:53,909
-Yeah, yeah, fabulous. Each and every one.
-But?

242
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,945
But we still one song short, J.
We want Christmas in the air,

243
00:21:58,050 --> 00:22:00,151
fabulous brotherly love,

244
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,152
the jingle... The spirit song.
We that song short.

245
00:22:04,523 --> 00:22:07,325
Remember this?
Can't stop, won't stop. Huh?

246
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:09,560
-Can't stop, won't stop!
-Yes.

247
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:12,561
Okay? Can't stop...

248
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:18,701
A Christmas song short. l can do that.

249
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:25,808
-That was a really good dinner, Momma.
-Yeah, what's up with that?

250
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,613
Well, if you guys like what l did for dinner,

251
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:31,749
just wait till you see
what l made for dessert.

252
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:34,685
-Made?
-Dessert.

253
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,686
-What's her problem?
-She looks happy.

254
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:40,856
-She is happy, and l know why.
-Yeah? Why?

255
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:44,693
'Cause l asked Santa to give her
her wish, and he did.

256
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:48,464
How many times do l have to tell you?
Santa does not give wishes.

257
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:52,634
-That's genies, stupid.
-He does give wishes, and you're stupid.

258
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:57,906
Hey, hey, hey, you three.
l don't want to hear any of that.

259
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:00,778
But, Momma, he started it.

260
00:23:00,779 --> 00:23:03,779
l will not cut into this cake
until l feel some love in this room.

261
00:23:07,786 --> 00:23:10,488
-There we go.
-Hey, all my peeps.

262
00:23:10,489 --> 00:23:12,490
-And there it went.
-Daddy!

263
00:23:12,491 --> 00:23:15,491
-Look at all my shorties!
-You're supposed to call first, James.

264
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,396
That's me calling, right now.

265
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,867
Hello? Yeah, Kim, he's right here.
Thanks so much for the heads up.

266
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,641
Hey, well, you know, l was in the vicinity,

267
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:33,642
and l knew you wouldn't mind me
dropping this off personally.

268
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:37,946
Oh, you know, l'd like it a lot better
in the mail. You can just set it on the table.

269
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,255
Hey, l ain't missed nobody's birthday
or nothing, did l?

270
00:23:44,256 --> 00:23:47,024
Nope. Mom just made it
because she's a really great mom

271
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:50,025
and she makes things.
You want to stay for dessert?

272
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:53,061
No, l can't do that. No dessert for me.
Actually, my dessert's out in the car.

273
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,600
Well, thanks for the check, James.

274
00:23:59,237 --> 00:24:02,237
Daddy, wait. Guess what happened today.

275
00:24:02,374 --> 00:24:05,374
A man saw Mommy
and said she looked nice.

276
00:24:05,644 --> 00:24:08,644
-ls that so? Your mommy does look nice.
-Yep.

277
00:24:09,114 --> 00:24:11,715
Yeah. And at these prices,

278
00:24:11,716 --> 00:24:14,716
your mommy could be looking
a whole lot better.

279
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:18,086
l mean, your mommy got a lot of paper.
Your mommy got so much paper,

280
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,124
when she walk down the street,
trees get scared.

281
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:31,033
We checked all of them.
Body shop, butcher shop, camera shop.

282
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:35,239
Pet shop, grocery store,
Korean grocery store.

283
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,240
-Got it, got it.
-That's a pretty dress, Mommy.

284
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:42,244
-Oh, that's no dress, sugar. That's paint.
-Don't corrupt that child.

285
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:45,249
Oh, hush.

286
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,618
Anyway, since it doesn't seem
like he works anywhere,

287
00:24:47,619 --> 00:24:50,154
we think
maybe he was in the Starbucks next door.

288
00:24:50,155 --> 00:24:53,155
-How was he acting? Caffeinated?
-l don't know. Maybe.

289
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,460
That's it then. l'll take the first shift.

290
00:24:56,461 --> 00:24:58,195
You're kidding.
We're gonna stake out a Starbucks?

291
00:24:58,196 --> 00:25:00,364
Well, they have better coffee
than the body shop.

292
00:25:00,365 --> 00:25:02,933
-You want to find him, don't you?
-Well, yeah, but...

293
00:25:02,934 --> 00:25:05,934
-All you've been thinking about?
-Yes.

294
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:10,739
l know. Yes, l want to see him.
l would love to see him.

295
00:25:11,142 --> 00:25:14,142
-Mommy, l got to go.
-Emily, you just went.

296
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,880
No, not to the bathroom. There.

297
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:30,325
-So, the mom wants to take you out?
-Yeah.

298
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:33,996
-lsn't that what you want? She's beautiful.
-Yeah, she's beautiful.

299
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:38,066
-So what's wrong?
-This. This is what's wrong.

300
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:42,273
See, l don't know that she wants to meet me.

301
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:45,274
So, if l did meet her, me, as Benjamin,
if l met her, that would be a lie.

302
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:51,181
-But Santa...
-Santa?

303
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:54,182
-Santa knows that she wants to meet me.
-Like Santa knows, he's watching, knows?

304
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,987
No, no. Santa... Santa knows...

305
00:25:59,824 --> 00:26:02,626
-Oh! Right.
-...that she wants to meet me.

306
00:26:02,627 --> 00:26:05,627
lf l did that, then l would be exploiting
the confidential information

307
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,399
for personal gain, and that's not cool.

308
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,400
-What?
-lt's the betrayal of the Santa trust, man.

309
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:15,571
Come on, man! Look, that would be true
if you were a doctor or something.

310
00:26:16,841 --> 00:26:19,841
But you work in a mall, dawg, part time.

311
00:26:21,212 --> 00:26:23,847
How about this? l meet her out once. Right?

312
00:26:23,848 --> 00:26:26,784
Maybe at a coffee shop
or somewhere, right?

313
00:26:26,785 --> 00:26:29,587
And l'll step to her
and l'll make something up.

314
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,588
Make something like,
''Yeah, baby, l'm from out of town,

315
00:26:33,224 --> 00:26:36,224
''and l sell office supplies.''
Something like that.

316
00:26:36,528 --> 00:26:38,963
Right? 'Cause it's boring.
See, office supplies, that's boring,

317
00:26:38,964 --> 00:26:41,964
and chicks don't dig that boring stuff, right?
You hear me on that, right?

318
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:45,701
Yeah, the office. Salt, can l get some salt?

319
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:49,805
You see, that way it's twofold,
because, as Santa, l fulfill my obligation.

320
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,410
But technically,
l don't betray the child's trust.

321
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:58,447
And that's what's important.
Obligation and trust go together.

322
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:01,118
-Let me ask you a question.
-Got it.

323
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,554
Say a little snot-nose kid
like the one, you know?

324
00:27:03,555 --> 00:27:06,555
What if he came to you,
''You know, Santa, l stole a Escalade.

325
00:27:08,526 --> 00:27:11,526
''l need you to get me some rims,
some spinning rims.''

326
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,167
Does that betray
the whole Santa trust thing?

327
00:27:17,168 --> 00:27:20,168
Okay, but why would a child come up to me
and say he stole an Escalade? l don't...

328
00:27:23,108 --> 00:27:26,108
Because you work in a mall, dawg,
part time!

329
00:27:28,513 --> 00:27:31,513
That's why you ain't Santa.

330
00:27:34,452 --> 00:27:35,919
You know what? Look, l'm leaving.

331
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,920
We've been sitting here like ninnies for,
what, an hour?

332
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:42,157
And for what? l may be a housewife,
but l'm not that desperate. l'm leaving.

333
00:27:43,461 --> 00:27:46,461
Okay, okay, okay.
Your next one is definitely decaf.

334
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:49,867
lt's crazy that we're sitting here
like Starbucks stalkers.

335
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:52,868
They're gonna name a drink after us,
the Crazy Lady Lattes.

336
00:28:02,681 --> 00:28:05,115
Wait a minute.

337
00:28:05,116 --> 00:28:08,116
-Why did we come here?
-l'm gonna pick up my jacket.

338
00:28:08,653 --> 00:28:11,653
And they better not have cleaned it.

339
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,090
-Hurry up, man.
-Yeah.

340
00:28:20,131 --> 00:28:23,131
-Hey, look. 1 2 o'clock.
-That's not him.

341
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:26,702
Yeah, but he's big.
You know, like the jacket big?

342
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:38,280
-He's got a friend. Guys.
-Oh, my God.

343
00:28:42,754 --> 00:28:45,189
-Oh, my God, it's him.
-Oh, God, he's gorgeous.

344
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:47,658
-Do you think he's coming in here?
-He ain't moving.

345
00:28:47,659 --> 00:28:49,159
Oh, God, please don't come in here.

346
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,361
Okay, how about l go next door
and bump into his friend, yeah?

347
00:28:51,362 --> 00:28:53,630
No, no, l'll go. lt'll be less obvious.

348
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:55,299
-No, no, neither.
-Less obvious?

349
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:58,300
-Titanic meet iceberg.
-Oh, you want to throw it out?

350
00:28:58,303 --> 00:28:59,770
-What does that mean?
-Oh, whatever.

351
00:28:59,771 --> 00:29:01,572
-Got to go find your man.
-No. No.

352
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:03,273
What did you do with the stuff
that was in the pockets?

353
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:05,843
l use it to scare away rats.

354
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:07,644
-You're the guy with the guy?
-What?

355
00:29:07,645 --> 00:29:10,581
The good-looking guy in the car. What's
his name? What's he do? What's he make?

356
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,582
My friend wants to meet him.

357
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:16,585
-By the way, l'm Brenda.
-l'm Jamal.

358
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,958
-Hi.
-Nice to meet you.

359
00:29:20,959 --> 00:29:23,959
Nice to meet you, too. Oh, the guy.

360
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:31,502
-Girl.
-l know.

361
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,370
Oh. Oh, get ready, girl.
Here he comes. Here he comes.

362
00:29:33,371 --> 00:29:36,371
No, no.

363
00:29:51,122 --> 00:29:54,122
-There. That guy, right there.
-My man?

364
00:29:54,692 --> 00:29:57,692
Hey, hey! You, chocolate love! Come back.

365
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,318
-Hey.
-Hi. Again.

366
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:22,653
Yeah.

367
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,654
-From the cleaners, right?
-Yeah, right, right, from the cleaners.

368
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:31,526
-So, you're buying sweets?
-Sweets? Oh, yeah!

369
00:30:31,596 --> 00:30:33,997
Yeah, l'm getting some sweets.

370
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,998
-Sweets for your sweetheart?
-No. No, l don't have a sweetheart.

371
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:43,572
-You?
-No, no, no. Totally free. Single.

372
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,513
-Right.
-Yeah.

373
00:30:49,514 --> 00:30:52,514
-Cool, cool, yeah. So...
-So...

374
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,519
So, you know, l'm from out of town.
l was just walking by.

375
00:30:57,655 --> 00:31:00,655
l had a little craving
for some petit fruit jelly beans, you know,

376
00:31:03,494 --> 00:31:05,562
so l just came on in, you know.

377
00:31:05,563 --> 00:31:08,563
l sell office supplies,
and it gets kind of boring, you know.

378
00:31:09,734 --> 00:31:11,568
What about you?

379
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:14,569
l'm from town.
Single mother with three kids.

380
00:31:17,442 --> 00:31:20,344
-And l just bought a stapler.
-That's good. That's good.

381
00:31:20,345 --> 00:31:23,345
-Well, so if you ever need anything...
-l'm sure l'll need whatever you have.

382
00:31:25,450 --> 00:31:28,450
By way of office supplies.

383
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,120
-l guess, you know, paper clips, pens...
-Pens. So many pens.

384
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:36,360
You know, 'cause l'll be,
''Oh my God, l need a pen.''

385
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,962
-You need some pens?
-l need a pen, and l don't have a pen.

386
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:41,963
-But you have pens.
-Then l'm your guy.

387
00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:47,168
-Benjamin Armstrong.
-Nancy. Will you go out with me?

388
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:52,407
-l'd love to.
-Great.

389
00:32:13,598 --> 00:32:16,598
l'm not cleaning that up.

390
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:43,091
-You look fabulous.
-Okay. Work it, work it.

391
00:32:44,862 --> 00:32:47,862
-Pop them collars.
-Yeah. Oh, and your purse, darling.

392
00:32:48,866 --> 00:32:50,701
-Thank you.
-Bye, Mom.

393
00:32:50,702 --> 00:32:53,702
Remember to have fun.

394
00:33:24,602 --> 00:33:27,602
Wow!

395
00:34:13,451 --> 00:34:16,451
Hey, there. That's real nice,
but you know what's missing there?

396
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:18,822
-What's that?
-The mohair swatch. Where's the mohair?

397
00:34:18,823 --> 00:34:21,823
-l told you, mohair.
-Mohair, done.

398
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:25,260
J-Jizz. J-Jizzy? Hello? Hello?

399
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:31,533
Hey, boss,
what about your Christmas album?

400
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,638
Come on, man, you sweating me again?
Christmas album.

401
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:36,940
Look, we gonna use the song right there.

402
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:39,941
-What? I Love Ho-Ho-Hoes? Or the one...
-No, no, no. The one right there. Yeah.

403
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:44,081
That's the one we're using. Yeah, that one.

404
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:47,082
Let me see if l got this right. We're using
I Saw Mommy Capping Santa Claus?

405
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:52,353
-That's...
-Yeah, what's wrong with that, huh?

406
00:34:53,191 --> 00:34:56,191
Hey, you know what, Delicious?
l've been watching you lately, man.

407
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:58,328
You've been stressing a lot
about this Christmas album.

408
00:34:58,329 --> 00:34:59,629
l'm gonna tell you something, man.

409
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,399
You gonna mess around
and give yourself an ulcer.

410
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,268
You want to spend the rest of your days
drinking buttermilk?

411
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,571
-lt could be gas.
-No more drinks. None of that.

412
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:10,474
Just buttermilk, buttermilk, buttermilk.

413
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:13,475
Me? l got to worry
about my spring line right here

414
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:16,644
that's missing the mohair swatch
like l asked for. Mohair.

415
00:35:18,649 --> 00:35:20,550
Just keep on stressing yourself out.

416
00:35:20,551 --> 00:35:23,551
-Don't stress.
-Yeah.

417
00:35:28,726 --> 00:35:31,726
That was not sexy. That was karate.

418
00:35:34,132 --> 00:35:37,132
-John-John, hurry up and get dressed.
-l am dressed.

419
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,969
Your pants are on the bed.
Put them on or you don't eat.

420
00:35:41,873 --> 00:35:44,873
Fine. l don't want to eat with that guy.
l don't want to meet him.

421
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:48,510
-l don't want to be on the same planet.
-l hear Pluto's nice.

422
00:35:49,547 --> 00:35:51,414
Shut up.

423
00:35:51,415 --> 00:35:54,415
-How do l look?
-Bootylicious.

424
00:35:54,418 --> 00:35:55,652
-Yeah?
-Yeah, Momma.

425
00:35:55,653 --> 00:35:58,653
Okay.

426
00:36:00,158 --> 00:36:03,158
-Beautiful flowers for a beautiful woman.
-Thank you.

427
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,462
This is for you.

428
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:08,463
-l'm Mikey.
-lt's a pleasure to meet you, Mikey.

429
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:13,368
-And this little princess must be Emily.
-l'm not a real princess. Just for pretend.

430
00:36:15,373 --> 00:36:18,373
Pretend? Well, you could have fooled me.

431
00:36:20,411 --> 00:36:23,411
-And this must be the man of the house.
-So you're him, huh?

432
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:27,918
Mom, is this the best you could do?

433
00:36:27,919 --> 00:36:30,919
Actually, it's not the best she could do.
l'm sure she can do a lot better.

434
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,492
But me, l'm on cloud nine.

435
00:36:35,493 --> 00:36:38,493
Why don't l show you around
the rest of the house?

436
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:32,882
-You guys tired?
-Yes.

437
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:34,384
-No.
-l mean, no.

438
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:36,786
-Did you guys have fun today?
-Yeah.

439
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:38,755
No.

440
00:37:38,756 --> 00:37:41,756
-Well, Benjamin liked you guys a lot.
-Does Dad know about him?

441
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,328
-No. He doesn't.
-Why not?

442
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:48,329
Because your dad and l lead different lives,
and we can do what we want.

443
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:52,267
-So why are you afraid to tell him?
-l'm not afraid. l just...

444
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,640
Well, l wanted to make sure
this was getting serious

445
00:37:59,043 --> 00:38:01,745
before l said anything.

446
00:38:01,746 --> 00:38:04,746
-ls it?
-Yeah, l think maybe it is.

447
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:18,159
You want to talk about this?

448
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:23,865
Okay, well, let me know
if you change your mind, okay?

449
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:35,710
You got us into this mess.
You're gonna get us out.

450
00:38:37,281 --> 00:38:40,281
An eyeglass holder and a telescope
and a laptop.

451
00:38:44,488 --> 00:38:46,356
A VideoNow...

452
00:38:46,357 --> 00:38:48,925
You go tell that big red rat what l told you.

453
00:38:48,926 --> 00:38:51,926
-Santa's not a rat.
-Yeah, whatever.

454
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:54,929
-Thanks. Bye.
-Where are you going? Hey! Hey.

455
00:38:55,132 --> 00:38:57,734
Don't you want, like, a baseball glove?
Or a friend?

456
00:38:57,735 --> 00:38:58,935
-You want a friend, right?
-l don't play sports,

457
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:01,936
and you're kind of starting to creep me out.

458
00:39:04,275 --> 00:39:07,275
-And what's your name little girl?
-You know me. l'm Emily.

459
00:39:08,746 --> 00:39:11,746
Oh, Emily.
Emily, the little girl who wants a bike, right?

460
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,683
No, the girl who asked you
to send a nice man to her mommy.

461
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:19,322
Oh, yes. Yes, yes, l remember.

462
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:22,323
And how is that working out?
Does Mommy want another color?

463
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:26,861
No, she likes him fine.
lt's my brother. He hates him.

464
00:39:29,834 --> 00:39:32,834
-Yeah? Which one?
-John-John.

465
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,537
And how did you know l have two brothers?

466
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:40,108
Well, Santa knows all the brothers,
sweetheart. He knows all the brothers.

467
00:39:41,479 --> 00:39:43,813
John-John says you got to get rid of him.

468
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:46,814
'Cause if you don't,
he's gonna give him the treatment.

469
00:39:47,918 --> 00:39:50,918
-And what might that be?
-See, tomorrow we're going bowling.

470
00:39:52,456 --> 00:39:55,456
And John-John says,
if Benjamin shows his face, he's gonna...

471
00:40:18,816 --> 00:40:21,816
Sweetie, it's okay. lt's okay. You know,
we're this close to a strike, okay?

472
00:40:22,553 --> 00:40:25,553
You'll get it next time. All right?
There we go.

473
00:40:25,923 --> 00:40:28,923
-John-John, you're up.
-That's right. Come on, John-John.

474
00:40:42,406 --> 00:40:43,773
So, everything's all good, right?

475
00:40:43,774 --> 00:40:46,774
Nancy, she's great.
Everything l ever wanted.

476
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:51,712
Well, don't sound so excited, light skin,
but they're looking at us.

477
00:40:52,249 --> 00:40:55,249
-Hey!
-Hey!

478
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:58,354
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

479
00:40:58,355 --> 00:41:01,355
lt's crazy, though. l've always dated
these creative types my whole life.

480
00:41:02,693 --> 00:41:04,627
-For better or worse.
-l'm not doing the Santa thing

481
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:07,628
and spying on her kids.

482
00:41:09,467 --> 00:41:11,134
l'm lying to her face

483
00:41:11,135 --> 00:41:14,135
about being some regular dude
selling office supplies.

484
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:17,271
And out of the blue, here comes this sweet,
straight-arrow of a guy

485
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:20,775
and l can't stop thinking about him.
l could really fall for him.

486
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:27,582
l done told Brenda so many lies,
l'm starting to believe them.

487
00:41:27,985 --> 00:41:29,118
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

488
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,119
Just 'cause l got to lie,
that don't mean you got to lie.

489
00:41:34,558 --> 00:41:36,659
Well, what do you think?
That you're executive

490
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:39,660
and you can hang out with an elf?

491
00:41:40,564 --> 00:41:43,564
Right. Right.
Okay, so what exactly is your job?

492
00:41:47,671 --> 00:41:50,073
A bounty hunter? Really?

493
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:52,909
-He just doesn't seem the type.
-That's what l said.

494
00:41:52,910 --> 00:41:55,812
But then he scooped me up
in his big gummi-bear arms,

495
00:41:55,813 --> 00:41:58,813
and he said, ''But l found you, didn't l?''
And l just... l just melted.

496
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:05,653
Oh, my goodness. That is so sweet.
And l see he inspired the new hairdo.

497
00:42:08,926 --> 00:42:11,294
Let's not tell him it's not all real.

498
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:14,295
l could just kill him.
Kill him, kill him, kill him.

499
00:42:14,732 --> 00:42:17,000
l think Benjamin's nice.

500
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:19,669
Well, l think he stinks.
Same as your buddy Santa Claus.

501
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:21,638
Hey, you take that back.

502
00:42:21,639 --> 00:42:24,639
Why? He dumps that punk on us,
then won't get rid of him.

503
00:42:25,442 --> 00:42:28,442
That's it. The treatment,
it starts right here, right now.

504
00:43:59,203 --> 00:44:02,203
You know, l just don't get it.
Do you get it? 'Cause l don't.

505
00:44:04,608 --> 00:44:07,608
-Maybe he's just better than you.
-Nobody is that good.

506
00:44:08,512 --> 00:44:11,512
He knows everything.
Benjamin ain't better than me.

507
00:44:16,754 --> 00:44:19,754
You ain't giving him no inside information,
are you?

508
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:21,758
What's inside information?

509
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:24,759
lt's important stuff that's just between us,
me and you.

510
00:44:24,995 --> 00:44:27,995
l don't tell anybody anything. Except...

511
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:32,199
-Except who?
-Santa. He gives me anything l want.

512
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,373
Santa?

513
00:44:37,374 --> 00:44:40,209
-Santa's real, John-John.
-No, he's not.

514
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:41,310
-Yes, he is.
-Yes, he is.

515
00:44:41,311 --> 00:44:42,945
No, he ain't!

516
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:45,946
Go to the mall for yourself and see.
He's there.

517
00:44:48,919 --> 00:44:51,919
Step up, step up. Come on, come on.

518
00:44:52,222 --> 00:44:55,222
Man, you're one big elf.

519
00:44:57,227 --> 00:45:00,227
Come on. Here we go. Here we go. All right.

520
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:03,099
So what's your name, little...
l mean, young man.

521
00:45:03,100 --> 00:45:06,100
Save it, okay?
l need you to get rid of somebody for me.

522
00:45:06,470 --> 00:45:08,204
Santa doesn't like the sound of that.

523
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:11,007
l know you sent that Benjamin guy
'cause of my sister.

524
00:45:11,008 --> 00:45:12,809
But now he just won't leave.

525
00:45:12,810 --> 00:45:14,944
And my mom's just too nice
to tell him to buzz off.

526
00:45:14,945 --> 00:45:16,713
Well, what would you like Santa to do?

527
00:45:16,714 --> 00:45:19,714
You must have another hard up mother
somewhere. Give her Benjamin.

528
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:22,652
Well, Santa doesn't normally
do returns, son.

529
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:25,653
But give him time to think about it.

530
00:45:26,356 --> 00:45:29,356
Well, think fast,
'cause l really, really want this guy gone.

531
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,460
-l'll think about it, young man.
-Thanks.

532
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:36,130
l'm all right. l'm all right.

533
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:05,526
Good evening, sir.

534
00:46:16,373 --> 00:46:19,373
-Notice anything different?
-No.

535
00:46:20,244 --> 00:46:23,244
Are you sure?

536
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:27,481
You hear that? lt's nothing.

537
00:46:28,385 --> 00:46:31,385
Silence. The kids are at Robin's.

538
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:37,226
Okay. Yeah.

539
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:40,227
No. l mean, you know, it's just...

540
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:44,298
-What's wrong?
-l don't know, it's just us.

541
00:46:46,069 --> 00:46:49,069
You are amazing. John-John, he hates me.

542
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:54,275
-He does not hate you.
-Trust me. He hates me.

543
00:46:54,978 --> 00:46:57,978
He is a kid. He also hates homework
and broccoli and a lot of other things.

544
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:03,217
Exactly, and l'm the big green
leafy vegetable of boyfriends.

545
00:47:05,622 --> 00:47:08,622
-Did he say something to you?
-No, not to me directly.

546
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:14,562
You should talk to him. Just tell him that
you want to be a part of his life.

547
00:47:20,571 --> 00:47:23,571
All our lives.

548
00:47:30,247 --> 00:47:33,247
Okay, deuce to seven lowball.
Aces and straights count as high.

549
00:47:35,619 --> 00:47:38,619
How can you all sit here and play
this stupid game like nothing's happening?

550
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:42,089
-'Cause some of us needs the money.
-Yeah, right.

551
00:47:42,659 --> 00:47:45,659
Don't you get it? They're alone right now.

552
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:47,830
-So?
-So?

553
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:50,831
Stuff might happen.
Then we'll never get rid of that punk.

554
00:47:51,134 --> 00:47:54,134
-What sort of stuff? Like kissing?
-Don't even say that.

555
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:59,106
Sweetie, he's a good man.
Your momma could do a lot worse.

556
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:03,210
l don't care how nice he is. He ain't my dad.

557
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:08,182
l'll take two. No, no, three. No, no, no, two.

558
00:48:09,753 --> 00:48:12,421
-Benjamin?
-Benjamin?

559
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:15,422
Just the man l wanted to see.

560
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:26,135
My mom put you up to this, right?

561
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:29,136
l mean, you two are hooking up
no matter what l think,

562
00:48:29,206 --> 00:48:32,206
so buy the kid a pretzel.
Maybe that'll shut him up.

563
00:48:32,709 --> 00:48:34,810
Okay, first of all,
your mother didn't put me up to this.

564
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:37,811
-All right? And nothing's been decided.
-Yeah, right.

565
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:40,716
Did you want salt or do you want the plain?

566
00:48:40,717 --> 00:48:43,717
-Man.
-lt's a joke. lt's a joke.

567
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:47,087
What is that horrible sound?

568
00:48:47,925 --> 00:48:49,825
l can play better than him.

569
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:51,594
You're talking about him
on the keyboard over there?

570
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,729
-Yeah.
-You can play the keyboard?

571
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:55,765
Yes.

572
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,766
-Hold on one second.
-Wait, where are you going?

573
00:49:09,046 --> 00:49:12,046
John-John.

574
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,690
Okay, sit down. Show me what you got.

575
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:26,360
All right, l will.

576
00:49:33,570 --> 00:49:36,570
Okay, just concentrate. You got it.

577
00:49:42,112 --> 00:49:45,112
There you go, all right.

578
00:49:49,786 --> 00:49:52,786
There you go, there you go. All right.

579
00:49:56,893 --> 00:49:59,893
-That's it. See?
-Yeah.

580
00:50:09,072 --> 00:50:12,072
See? See?

581
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:16,610
That's the focus right there.
That's what l'm talking about.

582
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:26,754
Now, l want you to just give me two.
Just like ding, ding. Here we go.

583
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:31,225
There you go. That's it. That's it.

584
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:39,233
That's it. There you go.

585
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:43,704
See? They love it. They love it.
This is the keyboard, give me five. Like this.

586
00:50:44,908 --> 00:50:47,908
Then you go keyboard. Tickle the keys.
Tickle the keys. There you go. Like that.

587
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:51,612
That's the keyboard five.
Give me the keyboard five.

588
00:50:52,916 --> 00:50:55,916
No. No, l'm ready to go home.

589
00:50:56,353 --> 00:50:59,188
No, come on, let's do it one more time.
Just one more time.

590
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:02,189
John-John, come on. We're just gonna do
it one more time, then we'll go. John-John.

591
00:51:07,030 --> 00:51:09,398
You know, we're gonna go ahead
and lock this up now.

592
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:12,399
Jizzy, the album is not ready yet.

593
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:15,704
-Not ready?
-No.

594
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:18,705
Have you seen the cover art on this?
That cover art is cold, man.

595
00:51:19,776 --> 00:51:22,776
This CD would sell
with no music on the album.

596
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:26,914
You know why?
Because my picture is on the cover.

597
00:51:28,518 --> 00:51:30,519
Well, let's lock it up. Excuse me. l'm allergic

598
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:33,520
to stuff that don't make sense, Jizzy.
The album is not ready.

599
00:51:33,657 --> 00:51:36,158
-Oh, yeah.
-Come on, you're killing me here.

600
00:51:36,159 --> 00:51:38,627
We need a song, Jizzy. A song.

601
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:41,628
Okay, l know it could sell blank,
but people don't sell blank CDs, okay?

602
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:47,534
l tell you what.
Whatever is on this disk goes on the album.

603
00:51:48,872 --> 00:51:51,872
All right. Whatever you say, boss.
lt's not a big deal.

604
00:51:52,542 --> 00:51:55,542
lt's just our careers
and reputations on the line.

605
00:51:55,812 --> 00:51:58,812
Whatever's on this, that's...

606
00:51:59,649 --> 00:52:02,649
lt's just your album, man. There you go.

607
00:52:36,253 --> 00:52:39,253
That's what your new album sounds like.

608
00:52:43,226 --> 00:52:46,226
lt just needs a harp or something.

609
00:52:51,268 --> 00:52:54,268
-Can't stop.
-Won't stop. Yeah. Yes.

610
00:53:00,777 --> 00:53:03,245
Hey. So, are they asleep?

611
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:06,246
Out like a light, every last one of them.
So, how did it go with John-John?

612
00:53:08,084 --> 00:53:10,619
-Yeah, yeah. lt went cool. lt was cool.
-Yeah? Really?

613
00:53:10,620 --> 00:53:13,522
Yeah, it was real cool for about 30 seconds.

614
00:53:13,523 --> 00:53:16,523
-Momma, l need water.
-Coming, baby.

615
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:21,361
-Don't go anywhere.
-Don't you worry about it.

616
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:25,799
l will not go anywhere.

617
00:53:33,410 --> 00:53:36,410
-Hello.
-Hello, Benjamin Armstrong?

618
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,148
-Yeah, who's this?
-l been listening to your CD.

619
00:53:39,149 --> 00:53:40,783
l'm kind of feeling it, you know.
l was wondering

620
00:53:40,784 --> 00:53:43,784
-if me and you could do some business.
-Okay.

621
00:53:44,254 --> 00:53:47,254
You know who this is, right?

622
00:53:49,960 --> 00:53:52,960
Yeah, l think this is the call
l've been waiting for my entire life.

623
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:56,432
That's right.
The call you've been waiting for all your life.

624
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:59,433
Yes. Halle Berry.

625
00:53:59,803 --> 00:54:02,803
The call from the number one
record producer in the world,

626
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:06,573
None other than J-Jizzy.
Can't stop, won't stop. That's right.

627
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:12,012
Now, what l want you to do is tomorrow,
2:30 sharp, me and you, breakfast.

628
00:54:14,551 --> 00:54:17,551
Cool. Cool. l'm there at 2:30. Yes!

629
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:20,522
Yes! l got the...

630
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,091
-Hey! Baby, baby.
-What happened?

631
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,093
-l just...
-Oh, my God.

632
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,862
l just sold my...

633
00:54:26,863 --> 00:54:29,863
My catalog.
l just sold my whole catalog of pens.

634
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:35,502
-Wow.
-That's great.

635
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:40,774
The garlic from dinner. l'm so sorry.
l'm gonna go brush my teeth.

636
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,080
-Tell Robin l'll call her in the morning.
-All right, cool.

637
00:54:50,420 --> 00:54:52,488
Robin, what's up?
She says she'll call you tomorrow.

638
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:55,124
-Who's this?
-Who's this?

639
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:58,125
Didn't l just finish talking to you
on the phone?

640
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:02,663
-Hey, who was on the phone?
-He said J-Jizzy.

641
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:07,334
Did you enter some type of contest
or something?

642
00:55:07,971 --> 00:55:10,971
More like l lost one.

643
00:55:12,108 --> 00:55:15,108
-lt's my ex-husband.
-Your... Your...

644
00:55:16,579 --> 00:55:19,579
Ex-husband. Yes.

645
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:25,352
l'm sorry. Yes, J.

646
00:55:25,922 --> 00:55:28,922
May l ask who was that
that just answered the phone?

647
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,627
Nobody. What is it?

648
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:34,628
What is it? Well, our son,
John-John, just called me up.

649
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,132
He sounded very weird on the phone.

650
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:40,133
Well, if you talked to your son every once
in a while, he wouldn't sound so strange.

651
00:55:41,171 --> 00:55:43,939
Goodbye, J,

652
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:45,641
Sorry.

653
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:48,642
Have a dude answer the phone.
Try to get me jealous.

654
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:51,714
-That's my ex-husband.
-J-Jizzy is your ex-husband.

655
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:54,715
-Yeah.
-So that means he's the pops, he's...

656
00:55:55,919 --> 00:55:58,487
-He's John-John's pops.
-Yeah.

657
00:55:58,488 --> 00:56:01,488
-And Emily and Mikey, too. So what?
-All three, the whole...

658
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:03,992
Yeah, it doesn't matter.
lt has nothing to do with us.

659
00:56:03,993 --> 00:56:06,829
-Right. No, baby, l know. lt sure doesn't.
-l know. l know.

660
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:09,830
-lt doesn't. lt doesn't. lt doesn't.
-Wait.

661
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:13,068
l can't believe l just said that
and actually meant it.

662
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:16,069
You know, l've been lying to myself,
you know, for years, saying,

663
00:56:16,573 --> 00:56:19,573
he doesn't have this hold on me.
Just lying, lying, lying, you know?

664
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:22,344
He was preventing me
from actually having a life.

665
00:56:22,345 --> 00:56:23,712
-And then you.
-Me.

666
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:26,713
You. You. You set me free.

667
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:31,918
-No problem. You're welcome.
-Wait.

668
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:35,055
What? What, are you leaving?

669
00:56:35,458 --> 00:56:37,926
l'm sorry. l thought you were finished.
You weren't finished?

670
00:56:37,927 --> 00:56:40,927
l was finished, but l...

671
00:56:41,164 --> 00:56:44,164
The kids are asleep,
and l was thinking that...

672
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:50,804
Yeah. You know what?
l'm sorry, but l'm going to call you.

673
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:53,575
l'm going to call you.
By the way, the whole speech,

674
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:56,576
it really hit right here. The game is free,
the free thing, it's...

675
00:56:57,847 --> 00:56:59,948
Well, l...

676
00:56:59,949 --> 00:57:02,949
Benjamin. l was... Hello. Wow.

677
00:57:14,164 --> 00:57:16,999
Yo, man, you are not gonna believe
what happened.

678
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:20,000
l'm over at Nancy's house, right? My cell
phone rings out the blue. Guess who it is?

679
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:22,938
J-Jizzy! He wants to buy my song.

680
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,606
-That's good.
-Yeah, that's good, that's good.

681
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:27,607
-No! lt's not.
-lt's good until Nancy's phone rings.

682
00:57:28,144 --> 00:57:30,746
And guess who it is? J-Jizzy again, man.

683
00:57:30,747 --> 00:57:33,747
lt turns out that J-Jizzy
is Nancy's ex-husband.

684
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:36,652
-She's his ex-wife!
-Yeah, l knew that.

685
00:57:36,653 --> 00:57:39,653
You knew?
Man, how come you didn't tell me?

686
00:57:39,889 --> 00:57:42,889
How could you leave me...

687
00:57:47,597 --> 00:57:50,065
What is all this?

688
00:57:50,066 --> 00:57:52,267
-Work.
-You're an elf.

689
00:57:52,268 --> 00:57:55,268
l'm not an elf. Elfstein, 2223.
Bounty, yeah, we'll catch him.

690
00:57:58,908 --> 00:58:00,909
l'm a bounty hunter
just like you're an office...

691
00:58:00,910 --> 00:58:02,411
Whatever, man. l'm telling...

692
00:58:02,412 --> 00:58:04,980
l just don't know what l'm gonna do, Jamal.
What am l gonna do?

693
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,981
You know, all my life l've been looking
for two things, all right?

694
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:11,051
There's true love, and my big break.

695
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:14,154
-Now if l choose one, then l lose the other.
-Why?

696
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:16,425
What do you mean why, man?
What am l gonna say to Nancy?

697
00:58:16,426 --> 00:58:19,426
Okay, yeah, by the way, Nancy.
Yeah, baby, yeah.

698
00:58:19,863 --> 00:58:22,564
l don't sell pens, baby.
No, no, l don't sell pens.

699
00:58:22,565 --> 00:58:25,565
l'm just this shysty song-writing Santa,

700
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:29,336
who, now l have to dump you
and kiss up to your ex-husband.

701
00:58:30,874 --> 00:58:33,874
And then, what about J-Jizzy? This is what
J-Jizzy is gonna say. He gonna be like,

702
00:58:34,611 --> 00:58:37,611
''Yeah, Mr. Songwriter.
Yeah, let me tell you something.

703
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:41,114
''l will buy your song, but by the way,
have fun taking care of my kids.''

704
00:58:44,654 --> 00:58:46,154
That's ugly.

705
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:48,991
-Jamal. Baby, who's there?
-Nobody, baby.

706
00:58:48,992 --> 00:58:51,992
This lieutenant lost his mind and came by.
Go to sleep.

707
00:58:57,934 --> 00:59:00,934
Look, Three-Card Monte.

708
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:04,337
Yeah, we should run down to Hell's Kitchen.
We used to give it to them.

709
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:08,008
Same game. You just can't get caught

710
00:59:08,378 --> 00:59:11,179
in the same room at the same time
with either one of them.

711
00:59:11,180 --> 00:59:14,180
You're right. lt is the same. l just move here.
They're over there, l move here.

712
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:18,118
-Cool. Cool.
-And one other question. Hey, but wait.

713
00:59:24,661 --> 00:59:27,661
-l mean, he's a decent-looking man.
-No, Delicious, you're talking about sass.

714
00:59:29,265 --> 00:59:32,265
There's sass behind this man.
Look at him, man. He's coffee-bean black.

715
00:59:34,037 --> 00:59:37,037
Women love a coffee-bean black balladeer.

716
00:59:37,507 --> 00:59:40,208
That white turtleneck don't hurt neither.

717
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:42,911
-And the caramel hat...
-Makes me hungry.

718
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,513
Yeah, it makes you want to have

719
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:47,149
a Reese's Cup or something.
You know what l mean?

720
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:50,118
-Women like Reese's Cups.
-Yeah. He looks like cookies and milk.

721
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:51,720
That's what we should call him,
Cookies and Milk.

722
00:59:51,721 --> 00:59:53,255
Cookies and Milk. That's... You know what?

723
00:59:53,256 --> 00:59:55,958
That's better than Peaches and Herb.
Cookies and Milk.

724
00:59:55,959 --> 00:59:58,660
Cookies and Milk. There's two of them,
but it's just him with the...

725
00:59:58,661 --> 01:00:00,696
-Yeah.
-...milk shirt.

726
01:00:00,697 --> 01:00:03,697
We'll release the CD.
lt'll have one free chocolate chip cookie

727
01:00:04,500 --> 01:00:07,069
-with each CD.
-Call it Munchies,

728
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:08,870
-Munchies, yeah.
-That's the name of his album.

729
01:00:08,871 --> 01:00:11,871
l like it, man. l'm liking that.

730
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:15,308
So, how was that?
l mean, l could step it up a little bit,

731
01:00:16,045 --> 01:00:18,614
you know, if you want it
a little bit more up-tempo.

732
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:21,550
Or l could dial it back,
if you want to vibe with it a little bit.

733
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:23,385
You know, just vibe.

734
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:25,587
You need to head on down
to our business affairs office

735
01:00:25,588 --> 01:00:28,290
and talk to my man Sydney Kimmelfarb,

736
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:30,158

01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:32,527
Well, cool, cool.

01:00:32,528 --> 01:00:35,528
That's what's up. That's what's up. All right.

You contractually obligated
to lay this track right now,

741
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:47,741
Okay, all right.
But l haven't signed a contract yet.

742
01:00:48,177 --> 01:00:50,646
Well, you'd best take care of that then,

743
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:53,647
-Kimmelfarb.
-He's white.

744
01:00:55,318 --> 01:00:56,685
He's white.

745
01:00:56,686 --> 01:00:59,686
Right, right. Kimmelfarb. Got it.
Cool, all right.

746
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:07,429
Look, baby, l can't make you any promises.

747
01:01:07,430 --> 01:01:10,430
-We don't even know if he's in there.
-l don't care. l just want to see him.

748
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:14,034
-You can drop me off. l'll wait.
-l'm not gonna drop you off, John-John.

749
01:01:14,537 --> 01:01:17,537
Baby. Don't get out of this car. Boy!

750
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:26,848
Cramp.

751
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:28,216
Ben, where you at?

752
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:31,019
Listen, l can't make it, okay?
l'm stuck at J-Jizzy's studio.

753
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:34,020
You're gonna have to fill in for me.

754
01:01:34,657 --> 01:01:37,359
That's right. lt's time.
lt's time for you to step up.

755
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,895
Be the man. Be the big red one.
Be the suit, baby.

756
01:01:39,896 --> 01:01:42,297
-How're you guys doing?
-Just trying to keep up with this one.

757
01:01:42,298 --> 01:01:45,298
Yeah, you've gotten so big.

758
01:01:49,038 --> 01:01:51,773
Santa.

759
01:01:51,774 --> 01:01:54,774
Hey, did you find Sydney?

760
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,079
He wasn't where he was supposed to be.

761
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:00,080
Well, okay, well, let's get it started.
We can get it all legal later.

762
01:02:01,551 --> 01:02:04,551
Hey, is that Nancy? You know...

763
01:02:06,355 --> 01:02:09,355
l guess diarrhea can hit you at any time.

764
01:02:22,138 --> 01:02:23,805
Dad!

765
01:02:23,806 --> 01:02:26,806
Hey, what's up, shorty? My man.

766
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:30,577
-l miss you, Dad.
-l miss you, too, man. l miss you a lot.

But unfortunately, you know,
Daddy's making a song today. l'm...

769
01:02:36,252 --> 01:02:38,653
John-John, why don't you go to the kitchen
and get yourself a soda?

770
01:02:38,654 --> 01:02:41,654
Okay. l'll let you guys fight now.

771
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:04,279
-Sorry about that.
-Hey, hey, no problem.

-lf you gotta go, you gotta go.
-Yeah.

773
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:10,450
You wash your hands? Just playing.
Stay away from the fruit.

774
01:03:11,220 --> 01:03:14,220
Anyway, we'll get down there.
They're getting started.

775
01:03:14,557 --> 01:03:17,557
How many songs you got in you, Benjamin?

776
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:19,427
What's your dreams? Your hopes?
Tell me everything.

-Anything good? l like your songs, man.

779
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:32,205
-Sorry about that. l got it.
-Not the fruit.

780
01:03:32,408 --> 01:03:35,408
l spent all day...

781
01:03:35,511 --> 01:03:38,213
Okay. Don't even worry about that.

782
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:40,682
l'm gonna make him a smoothie
or something. There's got to be...

783
01:03:40,683 --> 01:03:43,618
Just grab the pieces
that fell on another piece.

784
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:46,619
That's fine, right there. Yeah, that's good.

785
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:57,997
That's right, little Cindy.
What do you mean you didn't get your bike?

786
01:04:05,575 --> 01:04:08,476
This isn't about you or me.
This is about John-John.

787
01:04:08,477 --> 01:04:10,111
l told you l was going to make time for him.

788
01:04:10,112 --> 01:04:11,646
-Right there.
-Not right now.

789
01:04:11,647 --> 01:04:14,416
-lt's always not right now.
-Over there.

790
01:04:14,417 --> 01:04:16,284
You wanna know why
he had to see you today?

791
01:04:16,285 --> 01:04:18,186
Why he was holding onto you so tight?

792
01:04:18,187 --> 01:04:21,187
l met a man, James. Yeah, a man.
A nice, normal man.

793
01:04:22,525 --> 01:04:24,993
A man that John-John
actually made a connection with,

794
01:04:24,994 --> 01:04:27,994
-and it scared the daylights out of him.
-l don't got time for this right now.

795
01:04:28,297 --> 01:04:30,498
l'm working on an album. Right, Delicious?

796
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:32,801
He does not have time.
He is working on an album. Trying...

797
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:35,802
-Stay out of this, Delicious.
-Mind your business.

798
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:40,008
l'm working on an album. Okay?

799
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:42,878
l gotta turn it in.
The deadline is Christmas Eve.

800
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:45,879
Everybody's gonna be there.
BET, Entertainment Tonight,

801
01:04:46,349 --> 01:04:47,849
This is why you want the kids
for the holidays.

802
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:49,718
You don't even care about Christmas.

803
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:52,719
You need them for the cameras
so Daddy can sell a few more CDs.

804
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:56,055
-You are whacked.
-And you're pathetic.

805
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:59,092
l just pray that the judge sees through you
faster than l did.

806
01:05:01,530 --> 01:05:04,530
Judge gonna also see
that you done gained weight.

807
01:05:06,068 --> 01:05:09,068
Where's Mr. Songwriter at?
Come on, let's do this.

808
01:05:09,605 --> 01:05:12,605
And a bike, too.

809
01:05:15,411 --> 01:05:17,178
And a puppy, too.

810
01:05:17,179 --> 01:05:20,179
Okay, a puppy. You're gonna get it.
Come on.

811
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:23,750
Come on, it's okay. l'm Santa. lt's okay.

812
01:05:23,853 --> 01:05:26,853
-Go, go.
-No, l don't want to. l don't want to.

813
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:49,108
l got you. l got you!

814
01:05:51,113 --> 01:05:54,113
l got you!

815
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:22,368
Yo, an album deal, man.
Yeah, with J-Jizzy, l swear to God.

816
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:26,205
-Look, man, that's great news. There you go.
-You know what this means, right, Jamal?

817
01:07:27,343 --> 01:07:30,343
-Benjamin Armstrong is a real songwriter.
-Well, check this out.

818
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:33,948
-l'm a real bounty hunter. That's right.
-Man, not so tight.

819
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:36,949
Hey, y'all be careful with him, man.
He's worth 500 bucks.

820
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:46,227
l gotta go dookie.

821
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:49,228
-You ain't gotta go to no bathroom.
-l want to go dookie.

822
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:55,535
All right, it's time for stockings.
Now, be careful with the glitter, okay?

823
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:58,840
-Okay, Mommy.
-All right.

824
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:01,841
-Fun, fun, fun.
-Thank you.

825
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:06,514
Okay, why the long face?

826
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:09,515
Benjamin and l were supposed to go
look for a tree today.

827
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:12,654
l don't know what happened.
l guess he just forgot.

828
01:08:12,655 --> 01:08:15,390
Honey, there could be 100 reasons
why he ran out like that.

829
01:08:15,391 --> 01:08:18,391
-Maybe he's never coming back.
-Now, honey, men are like trees.

830
01:08:19,528 --> 01:08:21,663
Rough, sturdy, but dull,

831
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:24,664
until a woman gets her hands on him,
gives him a little personality.

832
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:27,936
-Then once you've done all that...
-They leave you for a shrub.

833
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,937
No, they dry up, their limbs shrivel,
and they become a fire hazard.

834
01:08:31,841 --> 01:08:34,841
-No and no.
-Saved by the bell.

835
01:08:38,681 --> 01:08:41,681
Now, if you don't like this, there's another
one hanging from my rear view mirror.

836
01:08:46,322 --> 01:08:49,322
They're kissing.

837
01:08:52,862 --> 01:08:55,862
Kids, Brenda, let's go
and have some cocoa. Yeah?

838
01:08:56,732 --> 01:08:59,534
-What about the tree?
-Momma's chopping it down,

839
01:08:59,535 --> 01:09:01,302
-right now, baby.
-Yeah.

840
01:09:01,303 --> 01:09:04,303
-Let's just... Come on. Come on.
-Wait. Wait.

841
01:09:08,077 --> 01:09:10,879
-Look, about the other night...
-You don't have to say a word.

842
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:13,880
-Actually, yes, l do.
-Then just let me go first.

843
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:17,550
We have a beach house in Santa Barbara,
and we go there every Christmas,

844
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:21,087
you know, me and the kids. Just us.
You know, our family.

845
01:09:23,292 --> 01:09:26,292
And l'd love it if you would come
with us this year.

846
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:34,834
-l'll be right back.
-Okay.

847
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:37,906
Man, l gotta do it now. l gotta do it now.

848
01:09:37,907 --> 01:09:40,907
Okay, the pens, Santa. No. What do l do?

849
01:09:43,045 --> 01:09:45,480
-Pens, songwriter, Santa.
-Okay.

850
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:48,481
No, Santa, pens, songwriter.
Santa, pens, songwriter. Santa, pens...

851
01:09:55,624 --> 01:09:58,593
-What's wrong?
-That was my attorney.

852
01:09:58,594 --> 01:10:01,594
He ruled in Jizzy's favor.
He gets the kids for Christmas.

853
01:10:06,368 --> 01:10:09,368
-So you didn't say nothing to her?
-No, man, how could l?

854
01:10:10,539 --> 01:10:13,539
She just lost her kids for Christmas.
l just couldn't put that on her.

855
01:10:14,843 --> 01:10:17,843
And Jizzy, to her, sucks as a father.

856
01:10:19,415 --> 01:10:22,415
-Yeah, but he's still their father.
-What?

857
01:10:23,719 --> 01:10:26,120
l said he's still their father.

858
01:10:26,121 --> 01:10:29,121
This guy butters your bread just a little bit
and now you rolling with it?

859
01:10:29,258 --> 01:10:31,159
-No. No.
-lt sounds like you're rolling with it.

860
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:34,160
Look, if the judge agrees with him,
how come l can't?

861
01:10:35,664 --> 01:10:38,664
You don't understand, man.
You just don't understand.

862
01:10:38,834 --> 01:10:41,834
Okay, choose. Which one do you want
to take with you to see your dad?

863
01:10:42,171 --> 01:10:44,973
l don't know. Which one's the bike?

864
01:10:44,974 --> 01:10:47,974
Santa's still working on that one.
l want you to pick one of these.

865
01:10:48,811 --> 01:10:51,811
-l want that one.
-Okay, good choice.

866
01:10:52,248 --> 01:10:55,248
-l hope it's a race car.
-Here you go.

867
01:10:55,584 --> 01:10:58,584
l want you.

868
01:11:00,589 --> 01:11:03,157
l can't go, baby.

869
01:11:03,158 --> 01:11:05,994
But you'll only be gone a week, right?
And then, when you get back,

870
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:08,995
we can all have our very own
special Christmas. Okay?

871
01:11:12,968 --> 01:11:15,968
l'll get it!

872
01:11:18,974 --> 01:11:20,942
Okay, come in.

873
01:11:20,943 --> 01:11:23,378
-Hello.
-Hi, Melody Oates.

874
01:11:23,379 --> 01:11:26,379
J-Jizzy sent us to fit the kids
for the party tonight.

875
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:29,183
-Nobody called?
-No.

876
01:11:29,184 --> 01:11:32,184
lf they try them on,
we can hem them right here.

877
01:11:32,321 --> 01:11:35,321
l'm sorry. When exactly did my kids
become The Jackson Five?

878
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:38,324
-l ain't being Michael.
-Sorry, ma'am, l'm just doing my job.

879
01:11:45,234 --> 01:11:48,064
Kim? Get him here now.

880
01:11:48,065 --> 01:11:51,065
This is a new low, J, even for you.

881
01:11:51,301 --> 01:11:54,301
You got what you wanted. You got the kids
on the most special day of the year.

882
01:11:55,639 --> 01:11:58,639
You want to parade them around
like a damn circus act.

883
01:11:59,009 --> 01:12:02,009
-Look, this is just a party.
-Yeah, a party for you. Not them. You.

884
01:12:04,748 --> 01:12:07,283
You know what? l see what this is all about.

885
01:12:07,284 --> 01:12:10,284
-You just mad 'cause you lost.
-The kids are the losers in this, J.

886
01:12:11,388 --> 01:12:14,388
Not me or you. They could have had
a real Christmas, a normal Christmas.

887
01:12:15,826 --> 01:12:18,260
-With a real family.
-With who?

888
01:12:18,261 --> 01:12:19,962
You and that chump
you've been running around with?

889
01:12:19,963 --> 01:12:22,798
He's not a chump, J. He's a grownup.

890
01:12:22,799 --> 01:12:25,799
Unlike this 40-year-old spoiled brat
in a cheap chinchilla.

891
01:12:26,369 --> 01:12:28,471
l'm 35, l'm not spoiled, and guess what?

892
01:12:28,472 --> 01:12:31,073
We gonna see how much of a man he is
when he hook with me.

893
01:12:31,074 --> 01:12:32,775
l can't wait for you to meet.

894
01:12:32,776 --> 01:12:35,776
l gotta thank my lucky stars that l met him,
because l just hope, one day,

895
01:12:36,012 --> 01:12:39,012
we can get married.

896
01:12:42,853 --> 01:12:45,454
Excuse me.

897
01:12:45,455 --> 01:12:46,922
Excuse me.

898
01:12:46,923 --> 01:12:49,923
-Hold on, man, you can't just...
-Shut up! l got something to say.

899
01:12:51,094 --> 01:12:54,094
Why are you doing this?
You said you were gonna help me.

900
01:12:54,297 --> 01:12:57,297
You send us this guy, and now
my mom says she's gonna marry him.

901
01:12:57,434 --> 01:12:59,034
She loves him, you fat jerk.

902
01:12:59,035 --> 01:13:00,903
Now Mom and Dad
will never get back together.

903
01:13:00,904 --> 01:13:03,904
-Okay, now, hold on.
-l hate you. l hate you.

904
01:13:09,379 --> 01:13:12,379
l'm... Santa is sorry. Okay?
He didn't mean for this to happen.

905
01:13:16,253 --> 01:13:19,253
That man is never gonna
see your mother again, okay?

906
01:13:21,324 --> 01:13:24,324
l promise.

907
01:13:28,131 --> 01:13:31,131
Jamal, l'm out. l'll be back.

908
01:14:08,271 --> 01:14:10,272
-Hello?
-Hey, Nancy,

909
01:14:10,273 --> 01:14:13,273
Hey, Benjamin.

910
01:14:14,177 --> 01:14:17,177
Listen, about the beach house.

911
01:14:18,481 --> 01:14:21,481
Something came up.
l'm not going to be able to make it.

912
01:14:22,219 --> 01:14:25,219
That's cool. We can just
do the holidays somewhere else.

913
01:14:25,555 --> 01:14:28,090
l can't do that, either.

914
01:14:28,091 --> 01:14:31,091
ln fact, l can't do us anymore. l just...

915
01:14:34,998 --> 01:14:37,867
l won't be seeing you again. l'm sorry.

916
01:14:37,868 --> 01:14:40,868
Wait. What? Hello?

917
01:15:00,590 --> 01:15:03,590
The kids are fine. They're watching a video,
and these are for you.

918
01:15:04,761 --> 01:15:07,761
-Thanks.
-lt's okay. lt's okay.

919
01:15:09,399 --> 01:15:11,834
What happened?

920
01:15:11,835 --> 01:15:14,835
Mommy and Benjamin broke up. Sorry.

921
01:15:16,439 --> 01:15:19,439
-Mom. Don't cry.
-That's okay. l'm gonna be okay.

922
01:15:26,049 --> 01:15:27,449
She'll get over it.

923
01:15:27,450 --> 01:15:30,450
l didn't just do this for me.
l did this for all of us.

924
01:15:30,553 --> 01:15:33,553
Don't you want Dad back? l do.
l mean, sure, they fight all the time,

925
01:15:36,226 --> 01:15:39,226
but that's what people
who love each other do. They fight.

926
01:15:40,563 --> 01:15:43,563
-l liked Emily's wish better.
-Whatever.

927
01:15:46,169 --> 01:15:48,504
Hey, everybody, we are coming at you live

928
01:15:48,505 --> 01:15:51,505
from the J-Jizzy Christmas album
release party

929
01:15:51,608 --> 01:15:54,608
for J-Jizzy's Rockin' Christmas,

930
01:15:58,214 --> 01:16:01,214
Yeah, Christmas is a very
special time for me.

931
01:16:02,185 --> 01:16:04,887
-lt's very spiritual.
-Yeah, l got them. They just pulled up.

932
01:16:04,888 --> 01:16:07,888
Time to spend time with the children,
your loved ones, family.

933
01:16:10,026 --> 01:16:13,026
And this Christmas,
l intend to spend most of it with my family.

934
01:16:14,798 --> 01:16:17,798
-Dad! Over here!
-Kids are here.

935
01:16:18,802 --> 01:16:21,802
Do l look like l'm finished right now? Put
them in the dressing room or something.

936
01:16:23,506 --> 01:16:25,741
-We ain't got time for that. Let's go.
-What?

937
01:16:25,742 --> 01:16:28,742
Yeah, l love you, too.
As l was saying, l love family.

938
01:16:49,866 --> 01:16:52,866
Wow!

939
01:16:56,773 --> 01:16:59,773
-All aboard.
-Come on, kids. Free rides.

940
01:17:01,378 --> 01:17:04,378
Look. Look there. And there. And over there.

941
01:17:08,418 --> 01:17:11,320
All right, come on. That's enough of that.
Let's go. We gotta go this way.

942
01:17:11,321 --> 01:17:14,321
What are you looking at? You're not here
for fun. You're here to work, all right?

943
01:17:16,393 --> 01:17:18,160
What l thought was gonna be
the perfect Christmas

944
01:17:18,161 --> 01:17:20,329
is shaping up to be the worst Christmas.

945
01:17:20,330 --> 01:17:23,330
-Okay. This is not the worst Christmas.
-Yeah, you've got us, and we're your girls.

946
01:17:25,468 --> 01:17:27,669
No, you're right, you know.

947
01:17:27,670 --> 01:17:29,938
And James does know
how to throw a good party, right?

948
01:17:29,939 --> 01:17:32,939
-Yeah.
-l'm sure the kids are having a good time.

949
01:17:39,416 --> 01:17:42,184
Look at me.

950
01:17:42,185 --> 01:17:45,185
-Come on. Come on.
-Wow.

951
01:17:45,555 --> 01:17:48,524
-You're the gal I always dreamed of,
-What do you mean, Mike?

952
01:17:48,525 --> 01:17:51,293
When I was in the war,
I thought about you all the time,

953
01:17:51,294 --> 01:17:53,262
Oh, golly,
I have every single one ofyour letters,

954
01:17:53,263 --> 01:17:56,263
and I always remember Christmas Eve
you sent me a special something,

955
01:18:01,704 --> 01:18:04,704
Thank you. Thank you. Good to see you.
Thanks for coming.

956
01:18:07,010 --> 01:18:09,511
You know she's talking about
marrying this chump, right?

957
01:18:09,512 --> 01:18:12,512
l can't afford for that to happen.
That's gonna make me look stupid.

958
01:18:13,850 --> 01:18:15,984
-You know what l'm gonna do?
-What's that?

959
01:18:15,985 --> 01:18:18,985
l'm gonna marry her.

960
01:18:19,322 --> 01:18:21,390
-Then l'm gonna dump her.
-What?

961
01:18:21,391 --> 01:18:24,391
What?

962
01:18:25,428 --> 01:18:28,428
Hey, what's up, shorty? What's going on?

963
01:19:05,802 --> 01:19:08,802
-The mall is closed.
-Let me in. l need to see Santa.

964
01:19:13,176 --> 01:19:16,176
Santa died.

965
01:19:19,415 --> 01:19:22,415
-Don't listen to him, kid.
-Can you let me in?

966
01:19:25,221 --> 01:19:28,221
From the looks of things, l'd say
what you need is a good nose blowing.

967
01:19:29,392 --> 01:19:32,392
-l just need to see him.
-lt's Christmas Eve, son.

968
01:19:32,829 --> 01:19:35,829
-lt's a little late to be hauling out your list.
-Please, l gotta give back the wish. Please.

969
01:19:42,572 --> 01:19:45,572
Let me see what l can do.

970
01:19:45,842 --> 01:19:48,610
Probably get fired for this.

971
01:19:48,611 --> 01:19:51,611
l hope you ain't one of them
teenage cat burglar types.

972
01:19:51,915 --> 01:19:54,915
-No, l'm a good kid.
-Okay.

973
01:19:55,318 --> 01:19:58,318
-All right, go on.
-Thank you.

974
01:19:58,354 --> 01:20:01,354
Merry Christmas.

975
01:20:56,879 --> 01:20:59,879
-John-John?
-Santa, you're here.

976
01:21:04,120 --> 01:21:07,120
-Where's your mother?
-She's at home, crying. Emily's crying.

977
01:21:08,891 --> 01:21:11,891
Everybody's crying,
and it's all because of me.

978
01:21:12,629 --> 01:21:15,629
My dad doesn't even love my mom.
Benjamin does. Can you bring him back?

979
01:21:21,437 --> 01:21:24,437
Please? lt's all l want for Christmas. l swear.

980
01:21:32,248 --> 01:21:35,248
Benjamin?

981
01:21:38,888 --> 01:21:41,888
Hey, you know what you need?
You need a good long vacation.

982
01:21:43,326 --> 01:21:46,295
-Okay.
-Right, like l have time for a vacation.

983
01:21:46,296 --> 01:21:49,296
-Let's go to a beach.
-Oh, God.

984
01:21:51,367 --> 01:21:53,201
-Hello?
-Yeah, it's me.

985
01:21:53,202 --> 01:21:56,202
Did John-John come over there?
l still need him!

986
01:22:01,611 --> 01:22:04,611
l'll stay here, just in case he comes back.

987
01:22:05,682 --> 01:22:08,682
So, that's the story.

988
01:22:09,452 --> 01:22:11,853
All l can say, John-John, is that l'm sorry.

989
01:22:11,854 --> 01:22:14,854
l'll keep saying l'm sorry till April
if you want me to.

990
01:22:16,859 --> 01:22:19,859
Who are you gonna be then? Easter bunny?

991
01:22:25,234 --> 01:22:27,369
This is the most recent picture we got,
right there.

992
01:22:27,370 --> 01:22:28,437
The father is where?

993
01:22:28,438 --> 01:22:31,438
He's right over there.
He's distraught and everything.

994
01:22:31,574 --> 01:22:34,574
-Find my shorty, man.
-All right. l want eyes up high,

995
01:22:34,911 --> 01:22:37,911
-in case he's wandering in the perimeter.
-Eyes up high.

996
01:22:38,681 --> 01:22:41,550
-All right, go.
-We're on our way now.

997
01:22:41,551 --> 01:22:42,984
ls there any word on the child?

998
01:22:42,985 --> 01:22:45,153
-You can't come through here, ma'am.
-No, l'm his mother.

999
01:22:45,154 --> 01:22:46,254
-Sorry.
-Thank you.

1000
01:22:46,255 --> 01:22:49,255
-Well, we gotta get you back to that party.
-Yeah.

1001
01:22:52,061 --> 01:22:55,061
-Let's go.
-All right.

1002
01:23:10,213 --> 01:23:12,280
He's my son. He's my son.

1003
01:23:12,281 --> 01:23:15,016
-l just think we just need a second to sort...
-Where is he?

1004
01:23:15,017 --> 01:23:16,918
-Where is John-John?
-Okay.

1005
01:23:16,919 --> 01:23:18,820
Yeah.

1006
01:23:18,821 --> 01:23:21,821
Wow. Check out all the cops.
l wonder what happened.

1007
01:23:24,293 --> 01:23:27,293
You happened.

1008
01:23:27,430 --> 01:23:29,364
Let's go.

1009
01:23:29,365 --> 01:23:32,365
-Let him through.
-l'm a bounty hunter. Okay?

1010
01:23:33,035 --> 01:23:36,035
Delicious, do not handle me.
l know when l'm being handled. Stop.

1011
01:23:36,639 --> 01:23:39,639
-Where is our son?
-Look, l tell you this much.

1012
01:23:39,642 --> 01:23:42,642
lnstead of all this time-out stuff,
maybe you should try peeling his butt

1013
01:23:43,112 --> 01:23:44,346
when you find out where he's at.

1014
01:23:44,347 --> 01:23:47,347
Why? Because he ruined
your precious party?

1015
01:23:47,350 --> 01:23:49,851
And where's Mikey? Where's Mikey?
There's all of these people,

1016
01:23:49,852 --> 01:23:52,852
you don't even know where Mikey is.

1017
01:23:56,926 --> 01:23:59,926
-Look up in the balcony.
-Mommy. Help, Mommy.

1018
01:24:00,696 --> 01:24:03,696
Mikey! Hold on, baby.
Do something. James, do something.

1019
01:24:06,602 --> 01:24:09,602
-Mikey.
-Mikey, hold on, baby. Hold on.

1020
01:24:10,640 --> 01:24:12,841
Don't move, kid. Someone's coming to help.

1021
01:24:12,842 --> 01:24:15,842
-James! Don't just stand there. Help him.
-Rottweiler!

1022
01:24:19,816 --> 01:24:22,816
Mikey, Mikey. Come on, come on.

1023
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:26,920
Reach. Reach!

1024
01:24:28,958 --> 01:24:31,760
-Come on.
-Mom.

1025
01:24:31,761 --> 01:24:34,761
John-John.

1026
01:24:38,334 --> 01:24:41,334
Hold on, Mikey.

1027
01:24:43,339 --> 01:24:46,074
-Reach. Reach. Reach hard.
-Mommy.

1028
01:24:46,075 --> 01:24:49,075
Mikey, hold on, baby.

1029
01:24:52,715 --> 01:24:54,649
Come on, Mike. Come on.

1030
01:24:54,650 --> 01:24:57,586
-Help me, Santa, help me.
-Reach.

1031
01:24:57,587 --> 01:25:00,587
Come on, l got you. l got you. Just reach.

1032
01:25:03,359 --> 01:25:06,359
l got you.

1033
01:25:19,308 --> 01:25:22,308
Now, you know,
l wasn't about to let that happen.

1034
01:25:24,947 --> 01:25:27,947
Stop it.

1035
01:25:36,125 --> 01:25:38,527
-Go on.
-Mommy.

1036
01:25:38,528 --> 01:25:41,528
Mom.

1037
01:25:46,502 --> 01:25:48,570
-Benjamin?
-Benjamin?

1038
01:25:48,571 --> 01:25:49,971
Benjamin?

1039
01:25:49,972 --> 01:25:51,640
How do you know Benjamin?

1040
01:25:51,641 --> 01:25:53,441
Better question,
how do you know Benjamin?

1041
01:25:53,442 --> 01:25:55,710
-How do you know him?
-Yeah, how do you know her?

1042
01:25:55,711 --> 01:25:58,711
Who? Okay.

1043
01:25:59,615 --> 01:26:02,615
Exactly. A really laughable,
simple explanation.

1044
01:26:05,922 --> 01:26:08,657
Well, make me laugh then, Mr. Songwriter.

1045
01:26:08,658 --> 01:26:11,658
Songwriter? You're a songwriter?

1046
01:26:11,928 --> 01:26:14,928
He's no songwriter, Daddy.
He's Mommy's boyfriend.

1047
01:26:16,299 --> 01:26:19,299
What?

1048
01:26:20,369 --> 01:26:23,369
-You're Santa Claus also?
-Well, it's only seasonal.

1049
01:26:25,975 --> 01:26:28,975
-Pays close to nothing, but l'm Santa.
-A lot of surprises.

1050
01:26:33,115 --> 01:26:36,115
But it turns out to be
one of the best gigs l've ever had.

1051
01:26:39,155 --> 01:26:42,155
You know, as a struggling songwriter
l've had a lot of gigs.

1052
01:26:42,391 --> 01:26:45,391
l'm glad you enjoyed the journey,
'cause your days as a struggling songwriter,

1053
01:26:46,896 --> 01:26:49,896
they far from over. You're fired, chump.

1054
01:26:50,032 --> 01:26:53,032
Delicious!
l want that cut pulled immediately.

1055
01:26:54,170 --> 01:26:57,170
A couple of problems with that, boss.
First, the album's already been shipped off,

1056
01:26:57,974 --> 01:27:00,974
and second,
that's the best song on the whole album.

1057
01:27:01,077 --> 01:27:04,077
So you might want to keep that one
on there, just for sales and all.

1058
01:27:04,547 --> 01:27:06,481
Okay, then, since you like the song so much

1059
01:27:06,482 --> 01:27:09,482
you can spend the rest of your days
listening to it. You fired!

1060
01:27:10,152 --> 01:27:13,088
-l'm fired?
-But, Daddy, he is right. lt is a great song.

1061
01:27:13,089 --> 01:27:15,090
-And you fired, too!
-What?

1062
01:27:15,091 --> 01:27:18,091
As my son.
ln fact, everybody's fired, as my fans.

1063
01:27:20,463 --> 01:27:23,463
l want you all out. Everybody, get out!
Rottweiler! Routine 919. Sexy exit.

1064
01:27:32,341 --> 01:27:35,341
-Yeah, that's sexy.
-Get off!

1065
01:27:35,578 --> 01:27:38,578
-Dad!
-John-John.

1066
01:27:46,322 --> 01:27:48,990
That day at the mall.

1067
01:27:48,991 --> 01:27:51,991
My wish. The compliment.
Emily told you, didn't she?

1068
01:27:55,398 --> 01:27:58,398
Yeah. That's where the lie began.

1069
01:27:59,669 --> 01:28:02,669
But right here is where that lie ends.

1070
01:28:07,043 --> 01:28:09,411
Dad.

1071
01:28:09,412 --> 01:28:12,247
You okay? You want me to come with you

1072
01:28:12,248 --> 01:28:14,449
so you don't have to spend
Christmas alone?

1073
01:28:14,450 --> 01:28:17,450
Alone? l got plenty of company.

1074
01:28:22,992 --> 01:28:25,694
That ain't the reason
why you can't come with me, though.

1075
01:28:25,695 --> 01:28:28,695
-What?
-You ought to be with your momma.

1076
01:28:28,698 --> 01:28:31,698
l mean, she got this whole holiday thing
down to a science.

1077
01:28:32,401 --> 01:28:35,401
Fact is, she always did.

1078
01:28:38,274 --> 01:28:41,274
-And you're right. lt's a good song, too.
-Told you.

1079
01:28:42,978 --> 01:28:45,747
Hey, you know l love you
and your momma, right?

1080
01:28:45,748 --> 01:28:47,415
-Yeah.
-And your brother and your sister.

1081
01:28:47,416 --> 01:28:50,416
l love all of y'all. Sometimes l get
carried away with this whole J-Jizzy's thing.

1082
01:28:54,523 --> 01:28:57,523
l say stuff that hurt people's feelings,
but l don't mean it.

1083
01:28:58,627 --> 01:29:01,627
-Merry Christmas, Dad.
-Yeah, merry Christmas.

1084
01:29:05,501 --> 01:29:08,501
Hey, Dad.

1085
01:29:13,709 --> 01:29:16,709
Rottweiler. Daddy's leaving.

1086
01:29:19,982 --> 01:29:22,350
So l knew the truth
was gonna come out sometime.

1087
01:29:22,351 --> 01:29:25,351
Just want to say l'm sorry.

1088
01:29:25,354 --> 01:29:28,354
You really are one of the best things
that's ever happened to me.

1089
01:29:31,060 --> 01:29:34,060
Mikey, keep up with them race cars,
all right?

1090
01:29:35,431 --> 01:29:38,431
Emily, you really are a princess.

1091
01:29:42,004 --> 01:29:45,004
l'm sorry.

1092
01:29:59,822 --> 01:30:02,822
Keyboard shake?

1093
01:30:17,706 --> 01:30:20,575
What you waiting for? Go get him!

1094
01:30:20,576 --> 01:30:23,576
-Yeah, Mommy, go get your man.
-Yeah, go get him.

1095
01:30:57,313 --> 01:31:00,313
Hey, Santa.

1096
01:31:03,586 --> 01:31:06,586
l think l need a pen.

1097
01:31:18,901 --> 01:31:21,769
Daddy fired John-John.

1098
01:31:21,770 --> 01:31:24,105
What's worse than that is
Daddy fired me, too.

1099
01:31:24,106 --> 01:31:27,106
So now l'm on my own, looking
for some hot new talent to cut a cool record.

1100
01:31:28,277 --> 01:31:31,277
Anybody interested?

1101
01:31:31,580 --> 01:31:33,681
Merry Christmas.

1102
01:31:33,682 --> 01:31:35,617
Well, l just want a kiss on that.

1103
01:31:35,618 --> 01:31:38,618
-They want to kiss all the time.
-Yeah.

1104
01:31:40,356 --> 01:31:41,756
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

1105
01:31:41,757 --> 01:31:44,092
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

1106
01:31:44,093 --> 01:31:47,093
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

1107
01:31:48,230 --> 01:31:51,230
Well, l guess a wise woman
was right after all.

1108
01:31:51,600 --> 01:31:54,600
The best Christmas present
