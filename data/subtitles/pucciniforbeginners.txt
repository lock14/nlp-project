1
00:00:47,721 --> 00:00:48,951
Allegra!

2
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,074
How...how do you know her?

3
00:00:58,241 --> 00:00:59,390
That's my girlfriend!

4
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:02,857
Your what?!

5
00:01:03,581 --> 00:01:05,931
<i>There are two kinds of people
in the world...</i>

6
00:01:06,001 --> 00:01:07,812
<i>the kind who feel with their hearts,</i>

7
00:01:07,881 --> 00:01:10,097
<i>and the kind who feel with their heads.</i>

8
00:01:10,401 --> 00:01:13,718
<i>I was the head-feeling kind,
that's how I got into this mess.</i>

9
00:01:14,081 --> 00:01:16,470
<i>See, I was her girlfriend...</i>

10
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:20,597
<i>but I was also his girlfriend.</i>

11
00:01:20,598 --> 00:01:22,130
<i>Like everything in my life,</i>

12
00:01:22,401 --> 00:01:24,496
<i>it started with two things:</i>

13
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:27,759
<i>opera, and me breaking
someone's heart.</i>

14
00:03:28,521 --> 00:03:31,740
<i>This whole exoticizing of the "Orient"</i>

15
00:03:31,741 --> 00:03:34,300
<i>really gets on my nerves.</i>

16
00:03:37,401 --> 00:03:40,460
<i>If the Met thinks this is worth $200 a ticket,</i>

17
00:03:40,161 --> 00:03:42,592
<i>they are sorely mistaken.</i>

18
00:03:46,421 --> 00:03:49,897
<i>Stay awake! Stay awake!</i>

19
00:03:49,961 --> 00:03:52,959
<i>This is Act III... I think.</i>

20
00:04:00,681 --> 00:04:03,236
<i>It's so great! All of us here together</i>

21
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:05,471
<i>enjoying opera.</i>

22
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:07,472
<i>I'm so happy right now.</i>

23
00:04:18,121 --> 00:04:19,390
<i>It's mysoginist...</i>

24
00:04:19,401 --> 00:04:21,439
and feminist at the same time.

25
00:04:21,501 --> 00:04:22,950
That's the incredible
thing about it.

26
00:04:23,461 --> 00:04:26,639
I'm not saying Puccini himself
was a feminist or anything, but...

27
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:28,260
He certainly was not a feminist.

28
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:30,797
That is funny, Puccini is a feminist!

29
00:04:31,327 --> 00:04:34,017
It's the tension between Turandot's

30
00:04:34,218 --> 00:04:36,080
desire to avenge
the rape of her foremother,

31
00:04:36,081 --> 00:04:38,254
and also to give in to love!

32
00:04:38,641 --> 00:04:40,232
Against her deep fears!

33
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:41,850
That's the brilliant contradiction,

34
00:04:41,851 --> 00:04:43,977
that's what makes
the piece so compelling!

35
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:47,592
Allegra...need I remind you that
Calàf basically rapes her?

36
00:04:47,593 --> 00:04:50,561
No, he does not rape her!

37
00:04:50,721 --> 00:04:53,189
He does not, he loves her!

38
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:55,716
He loves her and she cries

39
00:04:55,801 --> 00:04:57,090
for the first time.

40
00:04:57,091 --> 00:04:59,720
Rainbows, and puppy dogs, and lollypops!

41
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:01,156
Passion!

42
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:04,173
You defend bad behavior
more than anyone

43
00:05:04,174 --> 00:05:07,213
- I've ever met in my life.
- Someone I know used to like my bad behavior.

44
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:12,613
<i>They've only been dating three months,
and Nell already wants to move in with her.</i>

45
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:15,793
<i>They're in love. Why are you making it
sound so pathological?</i>

46
00:05:15,861 --> 00:05:19,590
<i>Because it's pathological to become
attached to the hip after three months.</i>

47
00:05:20,817 --> 00:05:24,955
I like Vivian. She's much better
than Nell's last girlfriend.

48
00:05:25,141 --> 00:05:27,816
- What was her name?
- Flavia.

49
00:05:27,817 --> 00:05:29,417
Flavia!

50
00:05:30,341 --> 00:05:33,174
Right, right, right.
Flavia, Flavia...

51
00:05:39,101 --> 00:05:40,800
Why do you still have your coat on?

52
00:05:40,821 --> 00:05:41,970
I'm not staying.

53
00:05:42,061 --> 00:05:46,258
Oh, come on sweetie! Please,
let's not have this fight again.

54
00:05:46,301 --> 00:05:48,040
Allegra we have to break up.

55
00:05:48,541 --> 00:05:50,436
- What?!
- Yeah.

56
00:05:51,102 --> 00:05:54,439
When was the last time we did anything
together, and not end up in a fight?

57
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:57,500
- When we have sex.
- No, aside from that! Let's face it, OK?

58
00:05:57,501 --> 00:06:01,052
I hate opera, and I have to look up
half the words that you use, and...

59
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:03,730
I'm...not a lesbian.

60
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,935
- OK, I just have to tell you one thing.
- What?

61
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,714
- I have a boyfriend.
- What?

62
00:06:09,881 --> 00:06:11,841
- Yeah, I have a boyfriend.
- I don't care.

63
00:06:12,401 --> 00:06:14,880
I can't believe you want to break up
over some stupid little detail

64
00:06:14,881 --> 00:06:17,119
like who's a lesbian and who isn't!

65
00:06:17,555 --> 00:06:19,638
- I saw Jeff.
- What?

66
00:06:20,339 --> 00:06:23,139
Alriiiiiight! I win that one buddy!

67
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:26,259
<i>He's going to Saint Barts on business
and he wants me to go with him.</i>

68
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:28,489
<i>Noone goes to Saint Barts
on business, Sam.</i>

69
00:06:30,595 --> 00:06:31,665
He loves me.

70
00:06:33,104 --> 00:06:34,111
Are you saying that...

71
00:06:34,181 --> 00:06:36,180
- You sure you'll use that?
- It's mine.

72
00:06:36,181 --> 00:06:37,700
You're saying that I don't love you?

73
00:06:37,861 --> 00:06:39,772
Well, you know, if you do
you haven't said so.

74
00:06:42,124 --> 00:06:44,236
<i>She's right.
I haven't said "I love you",</i>

75
00:06:44,341 --> 00:06:46,816
<i>but I have a perfectly
logical explanation for it.</i>

76
00:06:47,769 --> 00:06:48,885
I'm only...

77
00:06:49,381 --> 00:06:52,259
I'm still getting to know you.

78
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:54,994
It's only been nine months!

79
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:57,780
You can't just love
a person out of the blue.

80
00:06:57,941 --> 00:07:01,141
You know what your problem is?
You're conflicted. Excuse me.

81
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:04,328
I'm conf...you...you want
to be Jeff's girlfriend

82
00:07:04,504 --> 00:07:06,347
who occasionally sleeps with lesbians,

83
00:07:06,382 --> 00:07:07,979
and you call me conflicted?

84
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:10,991
I would hardly call being
with you day and night

85
00:07:11,581 --> 00:07:13,676
for six months...ocassional.

86
00:07:18,981 --> 00:07:21,939
Look. Is it the lesbian thing?
Or is it me? Or what?

87
00:07:22,101 --> 00:07:23,136
Can you shut the door, please?

88
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:25,715
- I wanna know.
- I've already told you.

89
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:26,970
Tell her again.

90
00:07:27,781 --> 00:07:30,011
Allegra...I'm not a lesbian

91
00:07:30,012 --> 00:07:32,456
and you're not
the right woman for me anyway.

92
00:07:44,061 --> 00:07:46,521
<i>Doesn't anyone realize that
love is a smoke screen</i>

93
00:07:46,581 --> 00:07:49,097
<i>to keep us from facing
the real issues of the world?</i>

94
00:07:49,161 --> 00:07:51,252
<i>Global warming, poverty, famine,</i>

95
00:07:51,261 --> 00:07:55,215
<i>floods, tornadoes, tsunamis, real estate
development...gated communities?</i>

96
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:58,119
Studies show that being in
a long-term committed

97
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,015
relationship is good for you!

98
00:08:00,861 --> 00:08:03,250
It can even make you live longer.

99
00:08:07,921 --> 00:08:09,918
Who wants to live longer?

100
00:08:11,461 --> 00:08:13,292
<i>I hate being alone.</i>

101
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:16,737
<i>I'm not the kind of person
who should be by herself!</i>

102
00:08:16,901 --> 00:08:18,892
<i>I was made to be in a relationship.</i>

103
00:08:19,061 --> 00:08:20,255
<i>I'm smart...</i>

104
00:08:20,421 --> 00:08:21,774
<i>attractive...</i>

105
00:08:21,941 --> 00:08:23,932
<i>I published a novel once!</i>

106
00:08:24,781 --> 00:08:26,772
<i>I have a rent stabilized apartment!</i>

107
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:31,457
<i>I'm narcissistic, passive aggressive,</i>

108
00:08:31,621 --> 00:08:33,134
<i>self absorbed,</i>

109
00:08:33,461 --> 00:08:35,179
<i>and incapable of connecting.</i>

110
00:08:35,341 --> 00:08:36,057
<i>That's it.</i>

111
00:08:36,221 --> 00:08:37,415
<i>From now on,</i>

112
00:08:37,581 --> 00:08:39,572
<i>I'm just gonna be by myself.</i>

113
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,014
The woman voted Republican, that's
when you should have been worried.

114
00:09:12,015 --> 00:09:13,739
I saw it as a challenge.

115
00:09:13,941 --> 00:09:16,498
You always go for all the straight girls,
except for me of course.

116
00:09:16,533 --> 00:09:18,086
How come you never
made a pass at me?

117
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:19,990
You're right, we're too close.

118
00:09:20,061 --> 00:09:22,400
It would be weird, we've been
best friends for so long, right?

119
00:09:22,401 --> 00:09:24,501
We love each other
enough as it is, don't you think?

120
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:26,934
I really, really loved being with her.

121
00:09:26,941 --> 00:09:30,774
She's smart, warm, affectionate...

122
00:09:33,094 --> 00:09:36,081
You are gonna meet someone
tonight at this party, that's what.

123
00:09:36,749 --> 00:09:40,047
No. You'll meet someone, Molly.
I hate parties.

124
00:09:40,101 --> 00:09:41,530
Wear that. That looks cute.

125
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:43,338
You like it? I think
it makes me look a little fat...

126
00:09:43,941 --> 00:09:47,292
Female opression is showing,
but aside from that...you look good.

127
00:09:47,996 --> 00:09:50,093
Allegra, it's time
to reinvent yourself, sweetie.

128
00:09:50,581 --> 00:09:54,017
I need to get some food.
I need some chocolate.

129
00:09:54,181 --> 00:09:56,411
No, don't binge now!

130
00:09:56,581 --> 00:09:58,247
Wait for the party!

131
00:09:58,661 --> 00:10:00,299
Just wait, I'm almost read...

132
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,213
That does look kinda cute, I think.

133
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:53,092
God! This is fantastic, isn't it?

134
00:10:53,161 --> 00:10:54,350
This kind of view?

135
00:10:54,941 --> 00:10:57,680
It makes you fall in love
with the city all over again.

136
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:00,778
You think so?
Makes me wanna jump.

137
00:11:01,651 --> 00:11:03,479
Maybe you should take
your sunglasses off.

138
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,914
- I can't, I'm blind.
- No, you're not.

139
00:11:08,461 --> 00:11:09,866
<i>You're not blind!</i>

140
00:11:11,422 --> 00:11:12,934
Hi, Philip Russell.

141
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:17,954
Allegra Castiglione.

142
00:11:18,941 --> 00:11:20,969
Allegra Castiglione, the writer.

143
00:11:21,261 --> 00:11:22,057
A writer.

144
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:23,958
"Stuy Town Trouble."

145
00:11:24,621 --> 00:11:26,737
I remember when
your book came out.

146
00:11:27,221 --> 00:11:30,862
You were nominated for
a national book award, right?

147
00:11:31,501 --> 00:11:34,500
Actually, it was
the Book Critic Circle Award.

148
00:11:34,501 --> 00:11:36,479
Oh, great book!

149
00:11:36,901 --> 00:11:39,017
- You read it?
- Yeah, of course I read it.

150
00:11:39,181 --> 00:11:43,174
That part about taking a boat
down the Bosporus at night, right?

151
00:11:43,381 --> 00:11:46,141
And the death scene.
Oh yeah, it was just great.

152
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,300
Sure you didn't just read it 'cause of
the photo they put on the back cover?

153
00:11:50,301 --> 00:11:52,292
Cause now you can see
I don't look like that...

154
00:11:53,061 --> 00:11:55,700
That was a moment of youthful pulchritude,

155
00:11:55,861 --> 00:11:58,216
that is long since passed.

156
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,213
Youthful pulchritude?

157
00:12:00,621 --> 00:12:03,090
Don't ask me what
pulchritude means.

158
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:05,580
Pulchritude means beauty,

159
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:08,180
and, no, I was gonna ask
what youthful means.

160
00:12:08,181 --> 00:12:10,897
You seem pretty youthful to me.

161
00:12:11,101 --> 00:12:13,969
That's only because I've had the
same hairstyle since I was eleven.

162
00:12:14,181 --> 00:12:15,660
Hey, you're still here!

163
00:12:15,821 --> 00:12:18,255
I thought you were going to jump...
This is um...

164
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:20,732
He wrote that book, you know...

165
00:12:20,901 --> 00:12:22,860
"Ancient Bargain." Greg Sheinman.

166
00:12:22,861 --> 00:12:24,892
- Oh, of course! Philip Russell.
- Hi, Phil.

167
00:12:25,381 --> 00:12:29,260
Let's get out of this "nerdness",
and find a real party somewhere?

168
00:12:30,621 --> 00:12:33,439
-No, I don't wanna go, Molly.
- Yeah, you do...yeah you do!

169
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:36,056
You come too, glasses tweedy boy.

170
00:12:51,621 --> 00:12:54,738
<i>Molly always falls for married men.</i>

171
00:12:55,421 --> 00:12:57,616
My last lover left me for a man...

172
00:12:59,341 --> 00:13:00,490
Her old boyfriend...

173
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:02,256
Jeff.

174
00:13:05,181 --> 00:13:07,297
Probably they're gonna get married, too.

175
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:11,131
Marriage makes me sick to my stomach,
makes me wanna...

176
00:13:12,141 --> 00:13:12,812
throw up.

177
00:13:13,068 --> 00:13:16,377
Well, it's a stubborn institution,
like capitalism.

178
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:18,414
Are you a capitalist?

179
00:13:21,741 --> 00:13:23,572
I'm an assistant professor at Columbia

180
00:13:24,781 --> 00:13:25,930
finishing my dissertation.

181
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,859
So, you're a socialist?

182
00:13:31,581 --> 00:13:33,468
I don't think there are
any socialists anymore.

183
00:13:35,661 --> 00:13:37,014
Do you like opera?

184
00:13:41,461 --> 00:13:43,060
Very much...actually, yes.

185
00:13:43,061 --> 00:13:44,016
- Really?
- Aha.

186
00:13:44,181 --> 00:13:46,172
You're attractive, you know that?

187
00:13:48,581 --> 00:13:50,260
Pulchritudeness?

188
00:13:51,461 --> 00:13:53,258
Are you flirting with me?

189
00:13:55,741 --> 00:13:56,976
Are you flirting with me?

190
00:13:57,061 --> 00:13:58,928
Flirting? Me?

191
00:14:01,141 --> 00:14:02,401
What do you think I am?

192
00:14:02,941 --> 00:14:03,930
You're a man.

193
00:14:04,621 --> 00:14:05,770
I'm a lesbian.

194
00:14:08,541 --> 00:14:11,578
You just read my book, that's all.

195
00:14:11,741 --> 00:14:14,733
You and about...ten other people,

196
00:14:14,901 --> 00:14:16,853
all of them with the same last name.

197
00:14:17,981 --> 00:14:19,300
How about a cab?

198
00:14:21,621 --> 00:14:22,849
What subject?

199
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:24,451
Philosophy.

200
00:14:25,341 --> 00:14:27,332
- What?
- So sad!

201
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:29,775
A romantic...

202
00:14:29,941 --> 00:14:31,340
Yeah, let's go. Alright.

203
00:14:35,621 --> 00:14:37,434
Don't you have to be anywhere?

204
00:14:38,758 --> 00:14:41,488
- No. Not tonight, not really.
- Great.

205
00:14:41,901 --> 00:14:43,812
Why don't you come home with me?

206
00:14:44,101 --> 00:14:46,740
I haven't been
with a man in years.

207
00:14:46,901 --> 00:14:49,290
I think maybe you just
go to sleep and pass out.

208
00:14:49,461 --> 00:14:50,889
No, I don't think so.

209
00:14:53,021 --> 00:14:54,884
Don't put me in a cab!

210
00:14:55,261 --> 00:14:56,580
I'm drunk.

211
00:14:59,101 --> 00:15:02,252
When a lesbian propositions you,
you should be flattered,

212
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:03,934
you should be overjoyed.

213
00:15:06,441 --> 00:15:07,753
Are you married or something?

214
00:15:08,901 --> 00:15:10,095
What are you gonna have, Philip?

215
00:15:10,261 --> 00:15:11,535
I think I'll have a steak,

216
00:15:11,741 --> 00:15:14,175
and...a salad, and mashed potatoes.

217
00:15:14,661 --> 00:15:15,891
That sounds good.

218
00:15:18,221 --> 00:15:19,370
Something, yeah.

219
00:15:22,061 --> 00:15:23,414
I'm gonna be sick.

220
00:15:25,301 --> 00:15:26,560
<i>I didn't throw up on him,</i>

221
00:15:26,561 --> 00:15:28,174
just near him, OK?

222
00:15:28,181 --> 00:15:29,250
My head hurts.

223
00:15:29,421 --> 00:15:32,618
You have a humilliation hangover.
Greg's married, what a schmuck!

224
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:34,812
I have an audition today,
how do I look?

225
00:15:35,381 --> 00:15:36,240
You look great.

226
00:15:38,261 --> 00:15:39,558
Wait! Is Philip married?

227
00:15:40,661 --> 00:15:42,777
We talked about Kant's
cathegorical imperative.

228
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:45,739
Uh, you did not! Kant?
That sounds suspicious.

229
00:15:45,901 --> 00:15:46,856
Men are dogs.

230
00:15:47,421 --> 00:15:51,209
- What are you doing today?
- Obsessing over Samantha?

231
00:15:51,541 --> 00:15:52,815
No movies, no bookstores.

232
00:16:00,021 --> 00:16:01,579
Hi. It's me again.

233
00:16:01,781 --> 00:16:02,896
Ticket for one.

234
00:16:03,061 --> 00:16:05,131
<i>Cute blonde in there. Same movie.</i>

235
00:16:05,301 --> 00:16:06,780
Oh, please...

236
00:16:18,901 --> 00:16:20,653
<i>I told you she was cute.</i>

237
00:16:22,741 --> 00:16:23,776
Are you OK?

238
00:16:25,181 --> 00:16:26,819
God, that was really sad!

239
00:16:27,341 --> 00:16:29,571
It was called "Holiday",
for God's sakes!

240
00:16:29,781 --> 00:16:30,531
Totally sad.

241
00:16:31,181 --> 00:16:33,940
- You want a tissue?
- Sure.

242
00:16:33,941 --> 00:16:35,374
Sentimentalists!

243
00:16:37,261 --> 00:16:39,855
I always cry at old movies,
even when they're funny.

244
00:16:40,021 --> 00:16:42,489
- Anything in black and white, I'm a goner.
- Me too.

245
00:16:43,221 --> 00:16:45,595
You know Katherine Hepburn
was considered box-office poison

246
00:16:45,596 --> 00:16:46,870
when this film came out?

247
00:16:47,421 --> 00:16:48,376
Really?

248
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:51,339
- And "Bringing Up Baby" was a flop.
- It was?

249
00:16:51,581 --> 00:16:53,094
I love that movie!

250
00:16:55,696 --> 00:16:57,281
I don't know why
I'm looking at my watch.

251
00:16:57,782 --> 00:16:59,182
I don't have anywhere to be.

252
00:16:59,541 --> 00:17:01,827
I think your watch is wrong.

253
00:17:01,862 --> 00:17:04,813
It says 10 AM and
it's about 4 PM right now.

254
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,054
See, that's the other thing.

255
00:17:07,901 --> 00:17:09,892
This watch doesn't even work.

256
00:17:10,181 --> 00:17:12,490
That's another reason why
I don't know why I'm looking at it!

257
00:17:14,141 --> 00:17:16,616
Do you wanna get like,
some coffee or something?

258
00:17:17,581 --> 00:17:19,378
Sure! I'd love to.

259
00:17:22,621 --> 00:17:24,532
- I'm Grace, by the way.
- Allegra.

260
00:17:24,701 --> 00:17:25,651
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

261
00:17:28,301 --> 00:17:30,756
You don't seem like
an investment banker.

262
00:17:30,861 --> 00:17:33,250
You're not even wearing
a watch that works...

263
00:17:35,298 --> 00:17:39,540
But, do you know about Kaldor's theory
of circular and cumulative causation

264
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:42,094
and its impact on the global economy?

265
00:17:42,329 --> 00:17:44,860
- No.
- Well, I do.

266
00:17:45,461 --> 00:17:48,658
But...I really wanna be a glass blower.

267
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:51,500
A glass blower?

268
00:17:51,721 --> 00:17:53,374
You work in what's called a hot shop,

269
00:17:53,441 --> 00:17:57,035
and you have to hold
these long heavy steel rods,

270
00:17:57,036 --> 00:17:58,929
and you put them in a
one billion degree oven,

271
00:17:59,461 --> 00:18:02,578
and then you wind up with this
delicate little thing, like a...

272
00:18:03,381 --> 00:18:04,700
paper weight or something.

273
00:18:05,221 --> 00:18:07,132
You have great hands.

274
00:18:08,421 --> 00:18:09,570
You think so?

275
00:18:10,221 --> 00:18:13,452
Gosh, thanks. I've never really
noticed them before.

276
00:18:13,621 --> 00:18:16,658
I mean, I've noticed them, but
not "noticed", "noticed" them.

277
00:18:17,441 --> 00:18:20,171
My boyfriend never
notices things like that.

278
00:18:20,181 --> 00:18:22,341
I wonder if it's because we've been
together for so long.

279
00:18:22,642 --> 00:18:23,842
Do you have a boyfriend?

280
00:18:24,221 --> 00:18:26,371
No, I had a girlfriend, but...

281
00:18:26,741 --> 00:18:31,471
She...she walked out on me last week.

282
00:18:32,421 --> 00:18:33,519
Are you in love with her?

283
00:18:33,901 --> 00:18:36,461
I thought so, but I didn't say so...

284
00:18:36,621 --> 00:18:38,446
of course, she didn't think so.

285
00:18:42,141 --> 00:18:44,080
People who break up
with me usually are

286
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:46,020
in my life-long devotion.

287
00:18:48,741 --> 00:18:50,513
Are you flirting with me?

288
00:18:52,461 --> 00:18:54,736
I don't know, probably. I don't know...

289
00:18:54,941 --> 00:18:57,531
I don't meant to, though.
I'm sorry.

290
00:18:58,021 --> 00:18:59,919
Sorry, that was...

291
00:19:00,741 --> 00:19:01,928
a dumb question.

292
00:19:09,661 --> 00:19:12,414
I'm at the studio almost every night...

293
00:19:12,581 --> 00:19:15,580
- the glass studio.
- Yeah.

294
00:19:18,941 --> 00:19:21,694
Sorry about your girlfriend.
Call me, OK?

295
00:19:21,695 --> 00:19:24,081
OK, bye. Thanks.

296
00:19:45,621 --> 00:19:47,532
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

297
00:19:47,701 --> 00:19:49,373
Samantha? Hi.

298
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:50,894
It's me...

299
00:19:51,981 --> 00:19:52,731
You're

300
00:19:53,621 --> 00:19:57,011
in Saint Barts probably,
frolicking somewhere.

301
00:19:58,501 --> 00:20:01,334
We didn't discuss it! There's just...

302
00:20:05,061 --> 00:20:07,097
<i>Message box full.</i>

303
00:20:07,261 --> 00:20:09,860
<i>One more thing.
If this is Allegra calling </i>

304
00:20:09,861 --> 00:20:12,460
<i>to tell Samantha that
they didn't discuss it,</i>

305
00:20:12,621 --> 00:20:14,373
<i>you DID discuss it.</i>

306
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:17,897
<i>And, for your information,
she's not frolicking.</i>

307
00:20:44,056 --> 00:20:46,173
- Oh, excuse me.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

308
00:20:49,941 --> 00:20:52,540
- Allegra.
- Yeah...Philip?

309
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:53,690
That's right, yeah.

310
00:20:53,861 --> 00:20:55,419
What are you doing here?

311
00:20:55,781 --> 00:20:58,659
I finished my classes for the day.
So, what about you?

312
00:20:59,501 --> 00:21:03,460
Just writing a book review,
but I have to read the book first.

313
00:21:03,901 --> 00:21:05,220
What a coincidence!

314
00:21:05,861 --> 00:21:08,455
Freud says there are
no coincidences.

315
00:21:08,621 --> 00:21:10,293
Oh, The Odyssey!

316
00:21:11,941 --> 00:21:13,533
Dante's "Inferno", very nice...

317
00:21:13,741 --> 00:21:15,254
"To the Lighthouse."

318
00:21:16,621 --> 00:21:18,771
Martha Stewart's "Entertaining".

319
00:21:19,941 --> 00:21:23,058
Philip Roth, Toni Morrison, Stanley Kunitz.

320
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,697
Philip Roth is a misogynist.

321
00:21:27,301 --> 00:21:29,895
Martha Stewart's "Entertaining"!

322
00:21:33,141 --> 00:21:35,860
I'll buy the first round if you don't tell
anyone about me and Martha.

323
00:21:36,061 --> 00:21:37,474
I'll buy the second if you can think of

324
00:21:37,475 --> 00:21:40,275
something more original
to say about Philip Roth.

325
00:21:49,233 --> 00:21:51,434
- Nell's your ex, right?
- Right, right.

326
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:54,738
And Nina was the big one
before that. I put her in the novel.

327
00:21:54,901 --> 00:21:56,414
Molly's not an ex.

328
00:21:57,541 --> 00:21:58,690
Oh God, no, no.

329
00:21:59,581 --> 00:22:00,855
Straight as a board.

330
00:22:01,421 --> 00:22:04,174
Samantha is my most recent ex.

331
00:22:04,781 --> 00:22:07,818
I was really close to
getting close with her.

332
00:22:08,301 --> 00:22:10,974
"Close to getting close",
that's not a phrase.

333
00:22:11,381 --> 00:22:14,737
The whole settling down thing,
just makes me crazy.

334
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:18,213
Why can't people just fall in love,

335
00:22:18,421 --> 00:22:20,855
and when it ends, it ends?

336
00:22:22,781 --> 00:22:24,453
'Cause they have feelings?

337
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:31,000
Would you like something
to happen with this man?

338
00:22:31,501 --> 00:22:32,729
He's smart, charming,

339
00:22:33,261 --> 00:22:34,489
got a nice set of hair.

340
00:22:35,541 --> 00:22:36,690
Allegra, you're OK?

341
00:22:37,021 --> 00:22:38,870
She asks if we want
some more coffee?

342
00:22:40,821 --> 00:22:42,156
Do you mind
if we get the check?

343
00:22:42,821 --> 00:22:43,856
Yeah, let's go.

344
00:22:48,221 --> 00:22:52,055
So you're unresolved by your
relationship to relationships,

345
00:22:52,261 --> 00:22:57,255
because being committed might result in
some sort of bourgeois complacency.

346
00:22:57,256 --> 00:23:00,833
Committed! Just think about
that word..."committed".

347
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:02,959
Careful!

348
00:23:03,433 --> 00:23:04,894
I'm unresolved, so...

349
00:23:07,538 --> 00:23:11,893
Well...some people
are very resolved.

350
00:23:12,061 --> 00:23:13,380
Oh yeah? Are you?

351
00:23:15,141 --> 00:23:16,733
I always thought that I was.

352
00:23:17,701 --> 00:23:19,180
Lately, I don't know.

353
00:23:19,821 --> 00:23:22,176
Maybe you need a paradigm shift.

354
00:23:22,241 --> 00:23:25,180
Not that I know how that goes, I've had
the same hair style since I was eleven.

355
00:23:25,181 --> 00:23:27,412
- Yeah, you said that already.
- I did? Oh...

356
00:23:27,750 --> 00:23:28,980
How embarrasing!

357
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,403
Ah, well...

358
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,009
- See ya!
- Yeah, OK.

359
00:23:47,246 --> 00:23:51,779
- I don't...I don't know why I did that.
- I don't know why you did that.

360
00:24:15,518 --> 00:24:16,609
What is it?

361
00:24:24,421 --> 00:24:25,854
Don't be frightened.

362
00:24:25,855 --> 00:24:28,785
- Well.
- Well.

363
00:24:29,061 --> 00:24:31,428
I haven't done that
in about a thousand years.

364
00:24:31,461 --> 00:24:32,399
Have sex?

365
00:24:32,701 --> 00:24:35,542
- Have sex with a man, fool!
- Oh, and...?

366
00:24:36,221 --> 00:24:37,312
Nice.

367
00:24:37,461 --> 00:24:40,022
It's funny what the body
remembers if the mind forgets.

368
00:24:42,141 --> 00:24:43,770
Let's not make a big deal
out of this or anything.

369
00:24:43,771 --> 00:24:45,940
No, I don't make a big deal
about anything!

370
00:24:45,941 --> 00:24:46,976
Good.

371
00:24:54,901 --> 00:24:56,812
This feels like a real cliché.

372
00:24:56,981 --> 00:24:59,380
Sleeping with a woman who usually
sleeps with women is a cliché?

373
00:24:59,381 --> 00:25:01,019
No, not that part.

374
00:25:01,661 --> 00:25:05,020
Me and my girlfriend have been together
forever, we haven't had sex in months...

375
00:25:05,021 --> 00:25:08,021
and then I have great sex...
and it's with somebody else.

376
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:10,606
You're a guy...

377
00:25:10,821 --> 00:25:12,539
How long have you been together?

378
00:25:13,541 --> 00:25:14,610
A long time.

379
00:25:14,781 --> 00:25:16,453
You're not married?

380
00:25:17,441 --> 00:25:18,381
No.

381
00:25:20,701 --> 00:25:23,738
So, Charlotte and Kevin are
tying the proverbial knot.

382
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:27,535
They got together
just a few months before us.

383
00:25:27,701 --> 00:25:30,051
In the History of Medieval Music course.

384
00:25:30,181 --> 00:25:31,773
Right, right, yeah I remember that.

385
00:25:31,941 --> 00:25:33,527
- Why not?
- Well...

386
00:25:35,501 --> 00:25:36,900
What do you mean "why not"?

387
00:25:37,061 --> 00:25:39,621
I don't know, most straight people...

388
00:25:40,101 --> 00:25:41,898
get married after a long relationship.

389
00:25:42,061 --> 00:25:44,695
That seems to be the whole
point of being together.

390
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:48,734
Well...not all straight people are alike,
you can't generalize.

391
00:25:49,021 --> 00:25:50,374
Really? Why not?

392
00:25:50,541 --> 00:25:52,216
The world generalizes
about lesbians all the time,

393
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,217
is really gonna hurt your
feelings that much?

394
00:25:54,421 --> 00:25:58,414
Well, I won't generalize about you,
if you don't generalize about me.

395
00:26:02,901 --> 00:26:06,655
You have to admit that there are
some things that are just...

396
00:26:06,821 --> 00:26:08,698
true about straight people.

397
00:26:08,861 --> 00:26:10,260
Like what, Allegra?

398
00:26:10,461 --> 00:26:13,498
Like getting married, that is
the straightest notion in the world.

399
00:26:13,661 --> 00:26:16,300
Please...where have you been?
Gay people wanna get married, too.

400
00:26:16,821 --> 00:26:18,049
Look, that's different.

401
00:26:18,221 --> 00:26:21,595
In straight relationships it's always the
long-suffering woman who wants to do it,

402
00:26:21,696 --> 00:26:22,970
and the man who can't make a commitment.

403
00:26:22,971 --> 00:26:25,075
It's always the woman who
wants a "Big Day" in her life,

404
00:26:25,076 --> 00:26:26,569
and the man who acts as
he's about to go to jail.

405
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:28,860
That's different than the government
telling you that you can't get married

406
00:26:28,861 --> 00:26:30,220
because there's
something wrong with you.

407
00:26:30,221 --> 00:26:32,257
Of course that makes gay people
want to get married!

408
00:26:32,261 --> 00:26:34,297
In that version is transgressive.

409
00:26:34,298 --> 00:26:35,591
It's radical!

410
00:26:35,661 --> 00:26:37,333
In the straight version
it's just bourgeois.

411
00:26:38,141 --> 00:26:41,451
That's the most ridiculous, crass
generalization I've ever heard.

412
00:26:41,621 --> 00:26:43,657
That's completely and utterly specious.

413
00:26:45,141 --> 00:26:46,191
So, what about us, Philip?

414
00:26:47,701 --> 00:26:49,337
What are our plans?

415
00:26:51,409 --> 00:26:52,229
Plans?

416
00:26:52,878 --> 00:26:54,901
We've been together six years.

417
00:26:55,021 --> 00:26:56,295
Five years!

418
00:26:56,941 --> 00:26:57,930
Three years.

419
00:26:58,861 --> 00:27:00,419
A year and a half!

420
00:27:04,427 --> 00:27:09,291
They met in the Psychosexual
History of the Bay of Pigs class.

421
00:27:09,501 --> 00:27:10,695
That's where they...that's where...

422
00:27:11,781 --> 00:27:13,578
Forget it, I'll just have the salad.

423
00:27:14,261 --> 00:27:16,650
Heterosexual hegemony, babe.

424
00:27:17,021 --> 00:27:19,535
Monogamy, marriage,

425
00:27:19,701 --> 00:27:21,054
the biological clock,

426
00:27:21,221 --> 00:27:23,177
property, fidelity,

427
00:27:23,901 --> 00:27:25,653
misionary position...

428
00:27:26,981 --> 00:27:29,620
Thank God, I don't have to
deal with any of that!

429
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:33,173
Right, your relationships
are completely different.

430
00:27:33,341 --> 00:27:36,970
No pressure, no communication problems,
no acting out, right?

431
00:27:37,221 --> 00:27:39,177
Completely! Are you kidding me?

432
00:27:40,101 --> 00:27:43,252
Lesbian relationships are
totally different.

433
00:27:43,421 --> 00:27:46,652
Just listen to that word, commit!

434
00:27:46,821 --> 00:27:50,018
That's what they do when you go to
an insane asylum! They commit you!

435
00:27:50,181 --> 00:27:50,931
That's ridiculous!

436
00:27:51,101 --> 00:27:53,137
Commitment is the end of high romance

437
00:27:53,301 --> 00:27:56,134
and it's the beginning
of day-to-day closeness.

438
00:27:56,781 --> 00:27:59,614
It's sticking around when
it gets hard, you know?

439
00:27:59,781 --> 00:28:02,375
Is that why you're going back to Jeff?
For the hard parts?

440
00:28:04,221 --> 00:28:06,177
I'm leaving.
You're out of your mind.

441
00:28:12,581 --> 00:28:15,141
Philip, this is a brief encounter,

442
00:28:15,701 --> 00:28:16,856
if you know what I mean.

443
00:28:16,981 --> 00:28:17,936
I do.

444
00:28:19,381 --> 00:28:21,458
So let's make it last as long as we can.

445
00:28:28,301 --> 00:28:30,712
- So, have you heard from Samantha?
- No.

446
00:28:31,101 --> 00:28:32,500
Did you hear from that guy Philip?

447
00:28:32,821 --> 00:28:33,571
Who's Philip?

448
00:28:33,601 --> 00:28:37,552
This really super-attractive guy where
Allegra threw up on after Micky's party!

449
00:28:37,621 --> 00:28:39,179
Why didn't you tell me you
threw up on someone?

450
00:28:39,341 --> 00:28:42,538
It was nothing, just some guy
who read my book.

451
00:28:42,901 --> 00:28:44,129
Someone who read your book?

452
00:28:44,341 --> 00:28:47,240
He read it when it came out,
isn't that so sweet?

453
00:28:47,581 --> 00:28:49,414
- But he's married.
- No, he's not married, he has a girlfriend

454
00:28:49,415 --> 00:28:51,015
he's been with since college.

455
00:28:51,021 --> 00:28:52,456
I thought you haven't seen him.

456
00:28:52,821 --> 00:28:55,415
I'm sorry, how come
I don't know anything about this?

457
00:28:55,621 --> 00:28:58,296
There's nothing to "know" know.
Let's order dessert.

458
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:01,339
How come you meet the most interesting men,
and you're not even interested in men,

459
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,547
and I love men,
and I never meet anybody?

460
00:29:04,261 --> 00:29:05,740
Very long answer, Molly.

461
00:29:05,901 --> 00:29:07,220
The tiramisu...

462
00:29:07,861 --> 00:29:10,314
- OK, you sound weirdly defensive.
- Defensive?

463
00:29:10,315 --> 00:29:12,715
- You never order tiramisu.
- No, I do not!

464
00:29:13,781 --> 00:29:16,253
I met a woman too.
How is that, sister?

465
00:29:16,381 --> 00:29:18,492
Life is so unfair!

466
00:29:18,665 --> 00:29:21,293
Being alone you're about to confront
all those hideous issues

467
00:29:21,294 --> 00:29:23,094
that get sublimated
when you're in a relationship.

468
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:26,412
I never sublimate hideous issues in
relationships, I always act them out.

469
00:29:26,621 --> 00:29:28,816
You know that! I did it
when we were together.

470
00:29:29,061 --> 00:29:30,232
That's true.

471
00:29:30,317 --> 00:29:33,101
<i>I can't believe I just lied
to my best friends.</i>

472
00:29:33,261 --> 00:29:35,297
<i>I can't believe I slept with a man!</i>

473
00:29:35,361 --> 00:29:38,021
<i>Well, it's OK.
I'm never gonna see him again.</i>

474
00:29:38,681 --> 00:29:40,892
What do you mean you moved out?

475
00:29:41,061 --> 00:29:44,019
I'm a wreck.
I can't stop thinking about you,

476
00:29:44,181 --> 00:29:45,534
I can't stop...

477
00:29:45,741 --> 00:29:47,094
dreaming about you...

478
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:49,791
That's hardly enough reason
to change your life!

479
00:29:50,141 --> 00:29:51,256
Isn't it?

480
00:29:51,421 --> 00:29:53,013
Isn't it? Isn't it a sign

481
00:29:53,181 --> 00:29:56,300
I should be following my heart
instead of my head for once?

482
00:29:56,301 --> 00:29:59,771
Isn't living about change?
A paradigm shift?

483
00:30:00,261 --> 00:30:01,660
Jesus Christ!

484
00:30:02,161 --> 00:30:04,021
If I wanted something
like this to happen

485
00:30:04,022 --> 00:30:08,178
I would have had a one night stand
with another woman, not a straight man!

486
00:30:08,461 --> 00:30:11,050
I thought that men wanted
just to get laid and get out!

487
00:30:11,221 --> 00:30:14,293
Isn't that how most men are?
Isn't that how you're supposed to be?

488
00:30:14,461 --> 00:30:16,452
What the hell is wrong with you?

489
00:30:18,181 --> 00:30:20,251
You're attracted to me,
I know you are.

490
00:30:20,421 --> 00:30:23,094
I am, I'm wildly
attracted to you, but...

491
00:30:23,261 --> 00:30:25,576
I'm sure there's a perfectly

492
00:30:25,577 --> 00:30:27,891
good psychoanalitic reason for it.

493
00:30:28,101 --> 00:30:29,170
I'm a lesbian!

494
00:30:30,677 --> 00:30:33,676
Can't you respect the inherent

495
00:30:33,741 --> 00:30:36,413
boundaries that sexual identity requires?

496
00:30:36,414 --> 00:30:38,397
Love has no boundaries.

497
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:40,340
Philip, give me a break!

498
00:30:41,221 --> 00:30:44,133
Good bye, good luck,
and thanks for everything.

499
00:30:46,761 --> 00:30:49,978
<i>I have two tickets to
"Don Giovanni" for tomorrow.</i>

500
00:30:57,001 --> 00:30:59,250
Maybe we could have a
brief meaningless affair,

501
00:30:59,301 --> 00:31:00,820
starting tomorrow.

502
00:31:17,941 --> 00:31:20,161
- You're cute.
- Thanks.

503
00:31:20,701 --> 00:31:22,421
- You wanna go out with me?
- No, thanks.

504
00:31:22,941 --> 00:31:25,417
Why not? I mean,
we'd have good time.

505
00:31:25,421 --> 00:31:26,536
I'm a lesbian.

506
00:31:26,741 --> 00:31:28,140
I'm cool with that.

507
00:31:28,301 --> 00:31:30,337
You know I'm very...openminded.

508
00:31:30,781 --> 00:31:32,533
I already have a boyfriend...

509
00:31:33,301 --> 00:31:34,700
I don't want to marry you.

510
00:31:35,941 --> 00:31:37,456
Alright cool guy, thanks.

511
00:31:38,581 --> 00:31:40,412
A coffee and a bagel, Fernando.

512
00:31:40,581 --> 00:31:42,080
Hey! I know you.

513
00:31:42,081 --> 00:31:43,310
Oh my God!

514
00:31:43,345 --> 00:31:44,241
- Hi.
- Hi.

515
00:31:45,525 --> 00:31:46,617
You remember me?

516
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:49,096
Glass blowing.
How could I forget?

517
00:31:50,261 --> 00:31:52,071
You said I had great hands.

518
00:31:52,781 --> 00:31:53,657
You do.

519
00:32:03,869 --> 00:32:05,798
I'm having a nervous breakdown.

520
00:32:14,181 --> 00:32:15,216
So, I just told him, I said:

521
00:32:15,381 --> 00:32:18,817
"If you walk out that door, don't walk
back in 'cause it'll be locked."

522
00:32:18,881 --> 00:32:20,878
How did he just spring it
on you like that?

523
00:32:20,941 --> 00:32:22,374
Or maybe I said:

524
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:25,135
"I'll swing that door in your face."

525
00:32:25,201 --> 00:32:27,032
I don't remember
but it was a good one.

526
00:32:27,033 --> 00:32:29,033
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

527
00:32:30,141 --> 00:32:34,309
I'm so sorry, Grace.
That's really bad.

528
00:32:34,741 --> 00:32:37,460
Didn't I tell you
that men are dogs?

529
00:32:37,621 --> 00:32:40,260
I mean, mutts, pitbulls,

530
00:32:40,621 --> 00:32:42,418
- mongrolls...
- Did you?

531
00:32:42,941 --> 00:32:44,293
Maybe I just thought it.

532
00:32:45,586 --> 00:32:48,269
Allegra, let me just
tell you something.

533
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:52,816
You are so lucky that you're a lesbian.

534
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,390
I mean...men are just not worth it!

535
00:33:02,461 --> 00:33:05,514
Here, wait a minute.
Here you go.

536
00:33:05,515 --> 00:33:06,817
Thank you.

537
00:33:13,182 --> 00:33:14,644
I understand.

538
00:33:18,301 --> 00:33:21,004
Shoot! Actually, I have to go.

539
00:33:22,901 --> 00:33:25,290
You still have the number
of the glass studio?

540
00:33:26,461 --> 00:33:28,372
I could really use a friend right now.

541
00:33:32,021 --> 00:33:33,006
Call me, OK?

542
00:33:41,381 --> 00:33:42,793
She was coming on to you.

543
00:33:43,381 --> 00:33:47,194
- She was, right?
- For sure, damsel on distress and all that?

544
00:33:47,381 --> 00:33:48,939
I feel bad for her.

545
00:33:49,101 --> 00:33:52,173
My girlfriend walked out on me,
I know how she feels.

546
00:33:53,061 --> 00:33:55,131
It's hell being alone.

547
00:33:55,301 --> 00:33:58,293
No, honey. Hell is other people.

548
00:34:01,381 --> 00:34:02,939
Alright, I don't understand this.

549
00:34:03,101 --> 00:34:04,454
She's a lesbian,

550
00:34:04,621 --> 00:34:06,612
but she's sleeping with you.

551
00:34:07,181 --> 00:34:08,296
Well, yeah.

552
00:34:09,421 --> 00:34:11,139
Cool, but...

553
00:34:12,101 --> 00:34:14,485
Aren't most lesbians into...women?

554
00:34:14,981 --> 00:34:18,496
She is complicated and unusual.

555
00:34:18,901 --> 00:34:19,945
Right. Right.

556
00:34:22,701 --> 00:34:23,536
Is she hot?

557
00:34:24,237 --> 00:34:26,241
Yeah, I think so...

558
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,734
Is she one of those glamourous dykes
like from that show "The L Word"?

559
00:34:31,461 --> 00:34:33,452
I don't know what you're talking about.

560
00:34:33,561 --> 00:34:37,489
Is she a lesbian that's hot enough for guys
to like too, or is she one of those...

561
00:34:37,901 --> 00:34:40,893
Woman-Identified Woman types,
like the ones we went to college with.

562
00:34:42,661 --> 00:34:46,620
You can't reduce people
to cultural stereotypes.

563
00:34:53,393 --> 00:34:56,277
- Hi!
- Hi, I'm Allegra.

564
00:34:56,278 --> 00:34:57,478
Bye, Jimmy.

565
00:34:58,181 --> 00:35:00,828
Are you sure Allegra doesn't want to
come in for a glass of "vino" or anything?

566
00:35:00,829 --> 00:35:02,273
Maybe next time.

567
00:35:09,581 --> 00:35:12,334
- I love that music!
- Well, that whole story...

568
00:35:12,501 --> 00:35:16,210
Counter Reformation cautionary tale

569
00:35:16,381 --> 00:35:20,793
about what happens when you exceed
the boundaries that God sets for men.

570
00:35:20,861 --> 00:35:24,490
- Too much sex and you go up in flames.
- Exactly, exactly.

571
00:35:38,301 --> 00:35:39,814
I don't believe this.

572
00:35:40,341 --> 00:35:42,356
University of Chicago offered me a job.

573
00:35:42,781 --> 00:35:43,711
It did?

574
00:35:43,781 --> 00:35:46,500
- Starting next semester.
- That's great!

575
00:35:46,921 --> 00:35:48,751
I would be leaving New York.

576
00:35:53,474 --> 00:35:55,312
I don't know if I wanna leave.

577
00:35:57,461 --> 00:36:00,299
Come on, Philip, that's great news!

578
00:36:00,821 --> 00:36:02,254
Just...tell me about it.

579
00:36:02,883 --> 00:36:06,779
They're interested in
a interdisciplinary approach

580
00:36:06,814 --> 00:36:09,976
to late 18th Century philosophical discourse

581
00:36:10,181 --> 00:36:11,375
You know, problems of...

582
00:36:22,781 --> 00:36:25,157
<i>I was with women
for a long time too.</i>

583
00:36:25,581 --> 00:36:26,822
And look at me now.

584
00:36:27,581 --> 00:36:28,561
I'm happy.

585
00:36:29,221 --> 00:36:32,311
Granted, I lost ten of out twenty
friends, but that's another story...

586
00:36:32,741 --> 00:36:36,612
Sexual identity is like
a totally outmoded concept.

587
00:36:36,821 --> 00:36:38,459
<i>It doesn't even exist.</i>

588
00:36:38,661 --> 00:36:42,779
It's totally cool to blur all these
old-fashioned cathegories.

589
00:36:42,981 --> 00:36:44,380
Bi's in, anyway.

590
00:36:45,401 --> 00:36:46,920
Don't knock it till you rock it.

591
00:36:47,821 --> 00:36:49,897
A lesbian with a boyfriend
is a contradiction.

592
00:36:50,527 --> 00:36:53,455
And...you ordered the salad.

593
00:36:59,501 --> 00:37:00,616
Something wrong with your food?

594
00:37:01,223 --> 00:37:05,337
Yeah. I don't know why
I ordered a salad. I don't...

595
00:37:05,501 --> 00:37:08,675
want a salad. I want a steak,
I want what you have.

596
00:37:08,741 --> 00:37:10,572
- OK. We order a steak.
- It's too late now...

597
00:37:11,101 --> 00:37:13,334
I have a salad. Damn!

598
00:37:13,541 --> 00:37:15,054
No, order a steak then.

599
00:37:15,221 --> 00:37:17,211
- Waiter!
- No, no, Philip, nevermind.

600
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:19,452
<i>What do you mean?
It's not a problem.</i>

601
00:37:19,781 --> 00:37:22,300
Yeah, it is a problem.
It's a big problem.

602
00:37:22,481 --> 00:37:26,547
Going from salad to steak and back
isn't as easy as it seems.

603
00:37:27,101 --> 00:37:28,011
What?

604
00:37:28,421 --> 00:37:29,854
I have to get out of here.

605
00:37:30,341 --> 00:37:32,252
What's wrong with you?

606
00:37:32,661 --> 00:37:33,616
I've got to get out of here.

607
00:37:33,781 --> 00:37:35,692
OK, all right, let me get you a cab.

608
00:37:36,001 --> 00:37:37,978
<i>Philip, when a woman says
she has to leave a restaurant,</i>

609
00:37:38,141 --> 00:37:39,540
you have to let her leave.

610
00:37:42,121 --> 00:37:43,400
I'll call you tomorrow.

611
00:37:54,081 --> 00:37:55,714
Philip. Hi. It's me, it's Allegra.

612
00:37:55,715 --> 00:37:58,730
I'm just calling to apologize
for walking out on you...

613
00:37:58,731 --> 00:38:00,890
I didn't...mean...I just...

614
00:38:01,861 --> 00:38:04,091
I feel like I need a little space.

615
00:38:05,861 --> 00:38:07,419
I'll call you tomorrow, OK?

616
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:32,279
Hi.

617
00:38:33,821 --> 00:38:35,156
Remember me?

618
00:38:35,461 --> 00:38:36,571
You made it!

619
00:38:39,043 --> 00:38:40,734
- A blow partner?
- Yeah.

620
00:38:40,901 --> 00:38:42,857
And this is the glory hole.

621
00:38:43,061 --> 00:38:45,780
Come on. The glory hole?
You're kidding me, right?

622
00:38:46,781 --> 00:38:48,214
You know what that is?

623
00:38:48,381 --> 00:38:51,612
Of course I know what it is.
I wasn't born yesterday.

624
00:38:51,981 --> 00:38:53,539
Glory hole...I like it.

625
00:38:54,101 --> 00:38:55,853
Good stuff. What else
you've got going on here?

626
00:38:57,221 --> 00:38:58,734
Here, I made this.

627
00:38:59,141 --> 00:39:00,210
You did? Wow!

628
00:39:01,141 --> 00:39:02,256
Paperweight.

629
00:39:03,981 --> 00:39:05,699
Really, really beautiful.

630
00:39:09,381 --> 00:39:11,258
So, why did you come here tonight?

631
00:39:13,781 --> 00:39:16,420
I've never been to a glass
blowing studio before.

632
00:39:16,581 --> 00:39:17,900
And you invited me.

633
00:39:18,101 --> 00:39:21,457
Well, I gave you my number.
That's usually an invitation to call

634
00:39:21,621 --> 00:39:25,136
and then, after the call, you move on
to the next possible invitation.

635
00:39:25,301 --> 00:39:27,098
The next possible invitation?

636
00:39:27,901 --> 00:39:30,813
Listen, you want a ride home?
I have a car.

637
00:39:31,021 --> 00:39:33,410
Usually you leave those things in the car.

638
00:39:33,581 --> 00:39:36,414
It was so expensive,
I was afraid someone might steal it.

639
00:39:37,341 --> 00:39:40,424
- I could have sworn I left it right here.
- Here?

640
00:39:40,425 --> 00:39:41,314
Yeah.

641
00:39:42,077 --> 00:39:44,956
There's a lot of glass here.

642
00:39:55,381 --> 00:39:57,531
You want me to go with you
to file a police report?

643
00:39:57,701 --> 00:39:59,976
No, let him suffer.
The car wasn't in my name.

644
00:40:00,741 --> 00:40:02,732
You want me to walk you
home or something?

645
00:40:13,581 --> 00:40:16,573
You know what, Grace?
You're so attractive.

646
00:40:16,741 --> 00:40:18,493
I really, really like you.

647
00:40:18,661 --> 00:40:20,299
You're gonna brush me off now, right?

648
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,480
No, Grace. I'm kind in a
complicated situation...

649
00:40:24,501 --> 00:40:26,241
Why did you come and see me tonight?

650
00:40:29,421 --> 00:40:31,215
So, you don't wanna sleep with me.

651
00:40:32,381 --> 00:40:33,513
I do.

652
00:40:34,061 --> 00:40:35,405
I totally do.

653
00:40:35,541 --> 00:40:37,418
But my life is...

654
00:40:38,261 --> 00:40:41,014
I just humiliated myself
trying to kiss a virtual stranger,

655
00:40:41,221 --> 00:40:44,736
my boyfriend just walked out on me,
and my car just got stolen!

656
00:40:44,901 --> 00:40:46,732
I'm not that desperate.

657
00:40:47,661 --> 00:40:48,539
Wait.

658
00:40:49,781 --> 00:40:50,687
What?

659
00:41:08,061 --> 00:41:10,999
Oh God, that was so great!

660
00:41:12,301 --> 00:41:15,657
Usually it takes me such a long time,
but this time it was like...

661
00:41:21,056 --> 00:41:22,827
- Thank you!
- You're welcome.

662
00:41:25,421 --> 00:41:29,458
I knew when I met you that
something sparkly was happening.

663
00:41:29,501 --> 00:41:32,732
I thought so too, but...

664
00:41:35,521 --> 00:41:37,532
Sweetie, what is it?

665
00:41:37,701 --> 00:41:39,339
What is wrong?

666
00:41:39,661 --> 00:41:41,697
No, it's not you it's just...

667
00:41:43,341 --> 00:41:47,414
sex is so great
but it's sad too, you know?

668
00:41:48,341 --> 00:41:51,513
It just brings up so many emotions.

669
00:41:51,821 --> 00:41:53,777
- You know what I mean?
- I know.

670
00:41:56,901 --> 00:41:58,366
Are you gonna call me?

671
00:41:58,901 --> 00:42:01,257
Of course I'm gonna call you!
Are you gonna call me?

672
00:42:01,901 --> 00:42:03,414
If you call me.

673
00:42:03,581 --> 00:42:04,681
Well, I'm gonna call you.

674
00:42:05,821 --> 00:42:09,336
- And then I'll call you.
- Good, I'm glad we got that out.

675
00:42:09,941 --> 00:42:11,394
When you're gonna call me?

676
00:42:12,941 --> 00:42:15,899
I can't decide, I can't decide...
Italian or sushi, what do you want?

677
00:42:16,261 --> 00:42:18,138
I'm easy...

678
00:42:18,301 --> 00:42:20,371
Or maybe we should get Thai.

679
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:23,135
OK, there's a place in Brooklyn
that looks really good.

680
00:42:23,301 --> 00:42:26,020
Philip, what are your
thoughts on non-monogamy?

681
00:42:32,501 --> 00:42:34,969
You're trying to tell me that you slept
with somebody else last night?

682
00:42:34,970 --> 00:42:35,970
No.

683
00:42:36,821 --> 00:42:39,699
Are you trying to tell me that you
want to sleep with somebody else?

684
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,697
No.

685
00:42:42,901 --> 00:42:45,369
Do you want me to want you
to sleep with other people?

686
00:42:45,541 --> 00:42:47,293
You mean like a three-way
type of thing?

687
00:42:47,461 --> 00:42:49,850
The straight man fantasy,
two chicks and a dude?

688
00:42:50,021 --> 00:42:52,314
- OK. Sounds good.
- No!

689
00:42:52,541 --> 00:42:53,974
OK, wait.

690
00:42:58,581 --> 00:43:00,060
I like you, OK?

691
00:43:02,221 --> 00:43:05,179
I like you too. It's just...weird.

692
00:43:06,581 --> 00:43:08,139
The guy thing or the like thing?

693
00:43:09,461 --> 00:43:10,576
Both.

694
00:43:13,381 --> 00:43:15,451
Yeah, let's get Thai food.

695
00:43:19,021 --> 00:43:21,216
<i>Grace, Tuesday's perfect. Hold on.</i>

696
00:43:21,421 --> 00:43:22,536
<i>Philip...hi.</i>

697
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:32,579
You're squishing my face!

698
00:43:39,421 --> 00:43:41,139
What's this?

699
00:43:43,021 --> 00:43:44,336
An old friend of mine...

700
00:43:45,781 --> 00:43:48,056
Good. Let's use it.

701
00:43:53,136 --> 00:43:56,316
Wow. I can't believe
last night with Grace...

702
00:43:57,021 --> 00:43:59,376
I'm seeing Philip this afternoon...

703
00:43:59,541 --> 00:44:01,577
This is crazy...

704
00:44:01,741 --> 00:44:03,572
Yeah, who says you can't have it all?

705
00:44:03,861 --> 00:44:06,659
I've got Petit Billy, which is cheese

706
00:44:06,821 --> 00:44:07,776
and mixed olives.

707
00:44:09,501 --> 00:44:11,359
This reminds me having lunch
with my father.

708
00:44:14,461 --> 00:44:17,578
<i>That was so much food yesterday.
Hold on a sec, that's my other line.</i>

709
00:44:17,741 --> 00:44:18,617
<i>Hi Grace!</i>

710
00:44:35,376 --> 00:44:37,580
- Hello.
- Hey, it's me.

711
00:44:41,861 --> 00:44:43,373
Can I call you later?

712
00:44:51,061 --> 00:44:54,098
You got together with Philip
as a way to get back at Samantha,

713
00:44:54,161 --> 00:44:56,540
and then, when your emotions got
too strong, you found Grace

714
00:44:56,541 --> 00:44:58,266
so you could project your conflict,

715
00:44:58,301 --> 00:45:01,293
and who so conveniently was
breaking up with her boyfriend

716
00:45:01,294 --> 00:45:03,014
making her another
unavailable love object,

717
00:45:03,015 --> 00:45:06,173
which, of course, confirms your deep
cinism about relationships in general,

718
00:45:06,174 --> 00:45:07,858
and keeps you from confronting
your real problem,

719
00:45:07,859 --> 00:45:09,459
which is how to be yourself.

720
00:45:11,101 --> 00:45:13,073
Jesus Christ, Nell!

721
00:45:13,221 --> 00:45:16,299
All I did was ask you what you
wanna have for lunch...

722
00:45:16,741 --> 00:45:17,617
Wendy's.

723
00:45:22,441 --> 00:45:24,836
You're saying you don't care
if I sleep with someone else?

724
00:45:25,461 --> 00:45:27,253
Yeah, I care very much.

725
00:45:27,461 --> 00:45:30,453
But sexuality is a grey area, isn't it?

726
00:45:30,621 --> 00:45:33,772
Desire isn't controlable,
which by its very nature it isn't,

727
00:45:33,773 --> 00:45:35,977
and wouldn't be possible
for a person to sleep...?

728
00:45:36,141 --> 00:45:37,210
Red.

729
00:45:37,211 --> 00:45:38,273
- Red?
- Yeah.

730
00:45:38,308 --> 00:45:41,352
Remember you told me an S&&M
can't use the word "no"...

731
00:45:41,981 --> 00:45:45,312
or "stop" because it ruins the sex,
so you choose a color as the code word?

732
00:45:45,381 --> 00:45:46,320
I told you that?

733
00:45:46,321 --> 00:45:48,971
Yes, so that's all I have to say: "red".

734
00:45:50,741 --> 00:45:51,617
Red.

735
00:45:52,301 --> 00:45:55,220
<i>Next stop will be
42nd Street/Times Square Station.</i>

736
00:45:55,221 --> 00:45:59,134
<i>Change for the N, R, shuttle trains
and connections to Port Authority.</i>

737
00:46:00,741 --> 00:46:05,531
<i>Hey girl! You! Yeah, you! The one
with the girlfriend and the boyfriend.</i>

738
00:46:05,621 --> 00:46:08,260
<i>You can't keep running
here and running there,</i>

739
00:46:08,261 --> 00:46:09,899
<i>first her, then him,</i>

740
00:46:09,961 --> 00:46:13,192
<i>back and forth like a crazy person!
Uptown...Downtown...</i>

741
00:46:13,193 --> 00:46:16,081
<i>morning, noon, and night,
trying to keep your story straight...</i>

742
00:46:16,116 --> 00:46:17,340
<i>D'hell knows what's going on?</i>

743
00:46:17,341 --> 00:46:19,616
<i>And here you are,
dashing on the damn train again.</i>

744
00:46:19,721 --> 00:46:21,534
<i>I mean, what the hell is that?</i>

745
00:46:22,701 --> 00:46:25,135
<i>Next stop will be Times Square Station.</i>

746
00:46:25,861 --> 00:46:27,794
Don't you feel like you should tell them?

747
00:46:27,829 --> 00:46:29,853
I think if I were her, I'd wanna know...

748
00:46:29,981 --> 00:46:31,016
No, you wouldn't.

749
00:46:31,181 --> 00:46:33,594
I guess he won't be too mad,
since you're seeing another woman,

750
00:46:33,595 --> 00:46:34,760
and not another man...

751
00:46:34,761 --> 00:46:37,197
No, for sure. That's very "guy".

752
00:46:37,201 --> 00:46:39,534
Look. I like them both.

753
00:46:39,701 --> 00:46:42,773
I don't want to explain myself,
I'm incredibly happy.

754
00:46:42,941 --> 00:46:44,169
Don't be a fool.

755
00:46:44,341 --> 00:46:47,793
You are not happy. You're a wreck.
You're totally confused.

756
00:46:47,828 --> 00:46:49,194
When can we meet them?

757
00:46:49,261 --> 00:46:50,250
Never.

758
00:46:51,461 --> 00:46:52,371
Nell Michaels.

759
00:46:52,581 --> 00:46:54,458
Philip Russell. Nice to meet you.

760
00:46:54,459 --> 00:46:56,057
- Hi Molly.
- Hi.

761
00:46:58,058 --> 00:46:59,376
Thank you.

762
00:46:59,781 --> 00:47:01,772
I've heard so much about you two!

763
00:47:01,941 --> 00:47:03,738
Really? We've barely
heard a peep about you.

764
00:47:03,901 --> 00:47:06,973
Oh, that's not true! Allegra says
you're all over that Kant guy.

765
00:47:06,974 --> 00:47:07,724
What?

766
00:47:07,901 --> 00:47:12,099
Yeah, my concentration is
in 18th Century German Philosophy.

767
00:47:12,261 --> 00:47:13,819
That is so interesting.

768
00:47:13,981 --> 00:47:15,792
If you like German misanthropes.

769
00:47:15,893 --> 00:47:17,693
"pickle shvantze"

770
00:47:18,941 --> 00:47:20,454
Deee-licious!

771
00:47:23,497 --> 00:47:26,275
I'm an assistant professor
at Columbia now, but it looks as

772
00:47:26,276 --> 00:47:29,476
though I might be moving on
to The University of Chicago.

773
00:47:29,821 --> 00:47:30,856
Well, that's good.

774
00:47:32,741 --> 00:47:35,414
- And you're a magazine editor, correct?
- Correcto mondo.

775
00:47:35,421 --> 00:47:37,512
Have you ever noticed that certain
people always talk about work?

776
00:47:37,513 --> 00:47:40,193
It's such a weird way for us to get
to know each other, you know?

777
00:47:40,861 --> 00:47:43,250
We can talk about our childhoods
or where we're from...

778
00:47:43,421 --> 00:47:45,889
I had a terrible childhood,
and I grew up in Philadelphia.

779
00:47:46,421 --> 00:47:48,810
So, Philip, where did you do
your graduate work?

780
00:47:50,274 --> 00:47:51,202
Sorry.

781
00:47:53,452 --> 00:47:54,930
- Who is it?
- Who is it?

782
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:57,337
Nevermind.

783
00:47:57,501 --> 00:47:58,377
Let's order.

784
00:48:12,061 --> 00:48:12,698
Honey?

785
00:48:13,061 --> 00:48:14,494
I think you have a message.

786
00:48:14,941 --> 00:48:15,991
"Honey."

787
00:48:19,101 --> 00:48:20,500
Why don't you turn the damn thing off?

788
00:48:20,701 --> 00:48:23,415
I think I'm gonna have the salmon.
And you, Philip? What are you having?

789
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:24,951
What you gonna have?

790
00:48:25,901 --> 00:48:28,176
Did he just ask her what
she was going to have?

791
00:48:28,821 --> 00:48:30,891
<i>I think I'm gonna have...</i>

792
00:48:31,101 --> 00:48:34,113
the mini-ravioli, Portobello salad, and...

793
00:48:34,781 --> 00:48:37,139
a side order of spinach, and...

794
00:48:37,861 --> 00:48:40,358
<i>some polenta and sausage,
then I think I'll try that</i>

795
00:48:40,359 --> 00:48:43,373
<i>squash with herb croutons,
hmmm...sounds so yummy.</i>

796
00:48:43,501 --> 00:48:46,432
<i>The grilled calamari, and...</i>

797
00:48:46,433 --> 00:48:48,680
maybe a little half baby rack of lamb.

798
00:48:53,188 --> 00:48:56,528
Sorry, I have to take this.
Will you excuse me?

799
00:49:04,221 --> 00:49:05,210
So Philip...

800
00:49:05,821 --> 00:49:07,413
<i>Big fan of Kant, are you?</i>

801
00:49:10,061 --> 00:49:12,334
I am sorry, I just got
caught up in a few things.

802
00:49:12,335 --> 00:49:14,818
<i>What are you doing?
Can I come join you?</i>

803
00:49:14,981 --> 00:49:17,272
I'm with Molly and Nell eating dinner.

804
00:49:17,341 --> 00:49:19,260
It's not that I'd like
to force them, sweetie.

805
00:49:19,261 --> 00:49:21,416
<i>I'd love to meet them.
I don't wanna be separate.</i>

806
00:49:22,020 --> 00:49:25,321
I'm not...I'm not trying
to keep you separate.

807
00:49:27,773 --> 00:49:29,413
I have my life to deal with.

808
00:49:30,508 --> 00:49:32,515
<i>Hey, are you OK? What's wrong?</i>

809
00:49:32,516 --> 00:49:35,169
- I'm fine.
- Hey! You OK? What's going on?

810
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:36,569
We've waited forever.

811
00:49:36,848 --> 00:49:39,121
- I've got to go.
- Wait!

812
00:49:39,581 --> 00:49:41,094
Who you're talking to?

813
00:49:41,261 --> 00:49:45,413
Nell's interrogating me. You didn't tell me
she was a philosophy major at Yale!

814
00:49:45,581 --> 00:49:48,778
And she speaks German, Jesus!
She's worse than my orals!

815
00:49:49,341 --> 00:49:50,690
What are you guys doing?

816
00:49:50,701 --> 00:49:52,214
Oh my God, Allegra you're smoking!

817
00:49:52,381 --> 00:49:54,358
- I'll call you later.
- Can I have a drag?

818
00:49:56,381 --> 00:49:59,930
- Molly's having a crisis.
- Philip do I look like I'm having a crisis?

819
00:50:00,101 --> 00:50:01,978
- Who she's talking to?
- Her mother, probably.

820
00:50:02,141 --> 00:50:05,053
- I  am sitting in the restaurant by myself.
- Is the food here?

821
00:50:05,136 --> 00:50:07,134
- What are you doing?
- I'm on the phone.

822
00:50:07,501 --> 00:50:08,940
Stop attacking Philip.

823
00:50:08,941 --> 00:50:10,215
Who says I was attacking you?

824
00:50:10,381 --> 00:50:11,730
Do you think I was attacking you?

825
00:50:11,901 --> 00:50:15,974
Jesus Christ, I'm having a hard time dealing
with this man in your life. Isn't that normal?

826
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:17,859
You're mi ex. He's a...man.

827
00:50:18,021 --> 00:50:20,137
Am I supposed just to accept
every crazy thing you do?

828
00:50:20,621 --> 00:50:22,259
Yes! That's what friends are for!

829
00:50:22,421 --> 00:50:24,759
Nell, noone's saying you're attacking Philip.

830
00:50:24,781 --> 00:50:27,559
You're just being your normal...cheeky self.

831
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:28,700
What's that supposed to mean?

832
00:50:28,701 --> 00:50:31,071
Why don't we all go back inside
and order another bottle of wine?

833
00:50:32,041 --> 00:50:34,140
Look, I cannot talk now!

834
00:50:34,141 --> 00:50:36,457
Just tell me what you mean by me
"attacking" your boyfriend?

835
00:50:36,941 --> 00:50:38,579
I didn't say that!

836
00:50:38,581 --> 00:50:41,052
<i>Allegra, why did you pick up the phone
if you can't talk to me?</i>

837
00:50:41,053 --> 00:50:42,953
<i>Hold on...hello? Hello?</i>

838
00:50:43,861 --> 00:50:45,100
Great. She hung up.

839
00:50:45,101 --> 00:50:46,420
- Who's she?
- Her mother.

840
00:50:46,421 --> 00:50:49,240
You know what, Allegra?
Screw you! This is bullshit.

841
00:50:49,301 --> 00:50:51,178
Why are you getting so mad?

842
00:50:52,341 --> 00:50:55,135
I'm sorry, they do this all the time.
I think is an ex-lover thing.

843
00:50:55,621 --> 00:50:56,690
I can't believe this.

844
00:50:56,901 --> 00:50:59,820
You know Philip,
we can just drink and eat

845
00:50:59,821 --> 00:51:01,857
- while they act out!
- I think we should go.

846
00:51:01,860 --> 00:51:03,620
I'm sorry that you think
I was attacking you,

847
00:51:03,621 --> 00:51:06,260
but you, sir, are in a
very complicated situation.

848
00:51:06,421 --> 00:51:07,576
And you, missy-miss...

849
00:51:09,341 --> 00:51:11,265
Thanks for being
such a good friend, Nell.

850
00:51:11,408 --> 00:51:13,128
Oh, auf Wiedersehen!

851
00:51:21,701 --> 00:51:25,137
That was the biggest disaster of my life.

852
00:51:25,381 --> 00:51:26,650
Ah...it's OK.

853
00:51:27,161 --> 00:51:29,338
Philip, I'm really sorry.

854
00:51:29,501 --> 00:51:33,494
I guess it's not as easy being friends
with you ex's as you said.

855
00:51:33,661 --> 00:51:34,788
Did I say that?

856
00:51:36,541 --> 00:51:39,619
Philip, it's never gonna work.
I'm just too lesbian.

857
00:51:41,221 --> 00:51:43,894
I don't know Allegra, from where I stand

858
00:51:44,381 --> 00:51:47,257
being a lesbian seems like
the least of your issues.

859
00:51:47,748 --> 00:51:49,160
<i>Anyway, I just...</i>

860
00:51:49,981 --> 00:51:52,256
I just think of you as Allegra.

861
00:51:57,301 --> 00:51:58,370
What issues?

862
00:52:15,121 --> 00:52:17,417
- Hello?
- Grace?

863
00:52:17,418 --> 00:52:19,575
- Hi.
- Hi.

864
00:52:20,101 --> 00:52:22,820
I wanted to say
I'm sorry about tonight.

865
00:52:24,581 --> 00:52:26,651
I didn't mean to make you feel bad.

866
00:52:28,195 --> 00:52:30,855
Oh...that's OK.

867
00:52:31,901 --> 00:52:34,734
I'm just...I'm a little bit
sensitive right now.

868
00:52:36,981 --> 00:52:38,105
I'm sorry too.

869
00:52:38,259 --> 00:52:41,333
No...no, it's not your fault.

870
00:52:44,281 --> 00:52:46,995
- I'll call you tomorrow, OK?
- OK.

871
00:52:48,221 --> 00:52:49,566
- Good night.
- Good night.

872
00:53:29,661 --> 00:53:33,131
Have you ever noticed that
women cry more easily than men?

873
00:53:34,301 --> 00:53:36,656
It's one of the things
I love about women.

874
00:53:39,701 --> 00:53:40,736
Me too.

875
00:53:44,581 --> 00:53:46,379
What was you last girlfriend like?

876
00:53:47,821 --> 00:53:48,856
Tall.

877
00:53:48,857 --> 00:53:51,343
Oh, come on! That's all you can say?

878
00:53:52,082 --> 00:53:55,560
Grace, sexual etiquette demands
you don't talk about

879
00:53:55,561 --> 00:53:57,861
one person when you're
with another person.

880
00:53:58,541 --> 00:54:01,499
"Sexual etiquette."
I've never heard of such a thing!

881
00:54:03,349 --> 00:54:05,496
Come on! Tell me something.

882
00:54:06,221 --> 00:54:07,217
One thing.

883
00:54:07,218 --> 00:54:08,371
Sorry.

884
00:54:12,211 --> 00:54:13,192
Grace...

885
00:54:13,741 --> 00:54:15,010
Speaking of other people...

886
00:54:15,075 --> 00:54:16,307
What a cute dog!

887
00:54:18,061 --> 00:54:19,330
<i>Hi puppy.</i>

888
00:54:23,621 --> 00:54:25,111
So cute.

889
00:54:25,941 --> 00:54:28,972
You know, when I was little
I wanted a dog more than anything.

890
00:54:29,541 --> 00:54:33,250
I begged my parents everyday.
And everyday they said "no".

891
00:54:33,621 --> 00:54:36,533
So, one day I went to the store and
I bought one of those joke leashes,

892
00:54:36,741 --> 00:54:38,997
the kind that make you look like
you have an invisible dog.

893
00:54:39,161 --> 00:54:39,916
You know what I mean?

894
00:54:40,501 --> 00:54:44,294
I walked it all around the house,
talked to it as if it were real.

895
00:54:44,861 --> 00:54:47,489
- That's brilliant. Did they give in?
- No.

896
00:54:51,341 --> 00:54:53,775
You know what I've realized
from being with you?

897
00:54:54,341 --> 00:54:56,552
My ex-boyfriend never really cuddled.

898
00:54:56,861 --> 00:54:59,579
- Did you ask him to cuddle?
- No, I think a person should know.

899
00:55:00,261 --> 00:55:03,059
No, a person can't know
what another person is thinking, Grace...

900
00:55:03,221 --> 00:55:05,496
Next time, tell him.

901
00:55:05,661 --> 00:55:07,617
I'm never going back to him.

902
00:55:08,861 --> 00:55:10,291
So tell the next boyfriend.

903
00:55:12,181 --> 00:55:14,076
You're my next boyfriend.

904
00:55:41,381 --> 00:55:42,616
What are you gonna have?

905
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:44,695
- You know what's funny?
- What?

906
00:55:45,141 --> 00:55:48,174
You always ask me what I'm gonna have
before you decide what you're gona have.

907
00:55:50,041 --> 00:55:51,394
Sorry, that's an old habit.

908
00:55:58,221 --> 00:55:59,896
So? What are you gonna have?

909
00:56:08,161 --> 00:56:10,272
Here's a thing you have to understand.

910
00:56:10,273 --> 00:56:14,418
It's that...men, they can't say
what they really feel or want,

911
00:56:14,419 --> 00:56:16,934
they have to act it out.
They're very hostile,

912
00:56:17,101 --> 00:56:19,535
passive aggressive and uncommunicative.

913
00:56:20,421 --> 00:56:23,458
- That's how they are, Allegra.
- Grace, you can't generalize.

914
00:56:24,661 --> 00:56:26,777
I was speaking from experience, Allegra.

915
00:56:26,981 --> 00:56:28,539
Something that you've been spared.

916
00:56:29,101 --> 00:56:30,216
Wait.

917
00:56:30,941 --> 00:56:34,305
- You mean you don't hate men?
- No.

918
00:56:35,181 --> 00:56:37,012
Then how come you're a lesbian?

919
00:56:37,081 --> 00:56:39,775
Because I love women,
there's a difference.

920
00:56:46,661 --> 00:56:48,413
<i>I want to make a toast.</i>

921
00:56:48,661 --> 00:56:50,219
To women united!

922
00:56:51,501 --> 00:56:53,332
This is amazing, Grace...

923
00:56:54,141 --> 00:56:56,735
Oh! "Amazing Grace"...

924
00:56:57,301 --> 00:56:59,610
I'm so bummed
your friend Nell couldn't come!

925
00:57:00,341 --> 00:57:01,807
No, you're not. Trust me.

926
00:57:02,043 --> 00:57:04,991
Grace...what's with all the
cut-out heads in your photos?

927
00:57:05,541 --> 00:57:07,179
That's him. My ex.

928
00:57:08,021 --> 00:57:11,331
I cut his head off. Haven't you ever
done that with old pictures of your ex's?

929
00:57:11,501 --> 00:57:12,980
Oh, tons of times!

930
00:57:13,461 --> 00:57:15,333
If I did that, they'd be mad at me.

931
00:57:15,461 --> 00:57:17,433
Did you keep yours or just
threw them away?

932
00:57:17,501 --> 00:57:19,571
I keep them. Sentimental, I guess.

933
00:57:20,661 --> 00:57:21,537
Do you wanna see him?

934
00:57:21,901 --> 00:57:22,978
Totally.

935
00:57:25,821 --> 00:57:28,740
- Why do you wanna see a picture of the ex?
- I'm just trying to get to know her.

936
00:57:28,741 --> 00:57:30,560
- She's so cute!
- She is.

937
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:59,854
It can't be truth!
They can't be ex's!

938
00:57:59,861 --> 00:58:03,380
Break it off, right now.
You've got to get out of there,

939
00:58:03,381 --> 00:58:06,092
before this turns
into a total calamity.

940
00:58:06,181 --> 00:58:09,331
If things can get this bad in New York City,
imagine what it's like in a small town.

941
00:58:09,741 --> 00:58:12,175
Then again...New York City
is a small town.

942
00:58:15,061 --> 00:58:16,892
You do not have a fever...

943
00:58:17,381 --> 00:58:19,417
This is where that goes.

944
00:58:20,318 --> 00:58:22,895
Alright, listen...this is
what we're gonna do.

945
00:58:23,061 --> 00:58:26,460
You're gonna get up, get dressed,
go find each person, and tell them

946
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:29,012
you're sorry, but it's over. Alright?

947
00:58:29,381 --> 00:58:32,339
I can't break up with them,
I'll hurt their feelings.

948
00:58:36,701 --> 00:58:38,060
You're amazing, it's just...

949
00:58:38,061 --> 00:58:41,690
I just got out of a relationship,
this is not healthy...

950
00:58:41,761 --> 00:58:43,314
this is too new...

951
00:58:57,043 --> 00:58:58,303
Oh, my God!

952
00:59:00,621 --> 00:59:02,413
They're cheating on me.

953
00:59:25,438 --> 00:59:27,016
- What?
- Huh?

954
00:59:27,461 --> 00:59:30,127
- You've been staring at me all night.
- Sorry.

955
00:59:32,561 --> 00:59:34,008
What you're gonna have?

956
00:59:38,341 --> 00:59:41,936
- What the hell is wrong tonight?
- You're face is scratching me.

957
00:59:42,621 --> 00:59:45,499
- I just shaved.
- You're scratching me anyway.

958
00:59:45,661 --> 00:59:48,300
Allegra, if you don't wanna
have sex, just say so.

959
00:59:53,821 --> 00:59:57,411
Now I get it. Now I know why
you won't include me in your life.

960
00:59:57,941 --> 01:00:00,535
- You're still in love with her.
- What are you talking about?

961
01:00:00,701 --> 01:00:03,534
I'm talking about what just
happened at the grocery store.

962
01:00:03,634 --> 01:00:06,890
Grace, you said you liked
maccaroni and cheese.

963
01:00:07,101 --> 01:00:09,974
All I said was Samantha liked
maccaroni and cheese too.

964
01:00:10,141 --> 01:00:11,923
That's all. Nothing happened.

965
01:00:11,958 --> 01:00:13,129
That's not all.

966
01:00:13,301 --> 01:00:17,499
I asked you what she looked like, and
you knew how many eyelashes she has.

967
01:00:17,661 --> 01:00:18,855
I'm going home.

968
01:00:18,856 --> 01:00:19,856
Grace, please.

969
01:00:19,921 --> 01:00:23,013
Let me just ask you,
where are we going?

970
01:00:24,541 --> 01:00:27,897
We're going...along...

971
01:00:30,621 --> 01:00:31,451
Do you love me?

972
01:00:38,126 --> 01:00:40,831
I...I...

973
01:00:41,381 --> 01:00:44,817
I ask you if you love me
and you can't even answer!

974
01:00:46,301 --> 01:00:47,390
You're like a guy.

975
01:00:58,061 --> 01:00:59,540
<i>What is a guy, anyway?</i>

976
01:01:00,640 --> 01:01:03,576
<i>Someone who can't say how she feels?</i>

977
01:01:03,741 --> 01:01:08,631
<i>Someone who can't say "I love you", because
loving someone makes a person vulnerable?</i>

978
01:01:14,301 --> 01:01:17,532
<i>I didn't talk to Philip or
Grace for three days.</i>

979
01:01:18,221 --> 01:01:19,415
<i>I tried to write.</i>

980
01:01:19,941 --> 01:01:22,330
<i>But somehow I just couldn't
get anything done.</i>

981
01:01:45,821 --> 01:01:47,300
So, what's up man?

982
01:01:47,461 --> 01:01:49,531
The lesbian is busy tonight?

983
01:01:50,861 --> 01:01:51,657
Shut up.

984
01:01:52,661 --> 01:01:54,731
Well, I've got a date myself, so...

985
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:56,576
Don't wait up.

986
01:01:57,477 --> 01:01:59,077
Ciao bello!

987
01:02:13,421 --> 01:02:14,260
Yes, Molly...

988
01:02:14,261 --> 01:02:17,717
Al, it's an emergency. I need you
to help me at a catering job tonight.

989
01:02:17,721 --> 01:02:20,012
- Oh, no.
- I wouldn't call you unless...

990
01:02:20,181 --> 01:02:23,567
I'm a writer, not a waiter. Alright?

991
01:02:24,114 --> 01:02:25,180
- Please.
- Absolutely not.

992
01:02:25,181 --> 01:02:27,859
- I haven't done a catering job in 5 years.
- Please.

993
01:02:28,121 --> 01:02:31,615
What's happening? What's happening?
Can you, please, put that down. OK?

994
01:02:40,403 --> 01:02:41,800
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

995
01:02:41,801 --> 01:02:44,500
A honeymoon in Paris,
it's so old-fashioned.

996
01:02:44,501 --> 01:02:47,374
- It's so romantic.
- Sam you look really happy.

997
01:02:47,541 --> 01:02:50,140
- You're glowing.
- I feel like I have a fever.

998
01:02:50,141 --> 01:02:51,893
Of course you have a fever,
you're getting married!

999
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:54,304
Here, a little shot of whisky should help.

1000
01:02:55,605 --> 01:02:56,620
Thank you.

1001
01:03:12,221 --> 01:03:15,020
Damn! I wanted one of
those toast points.

1002
01:03:15,021 --> 01:03:16,340
Can you hurry up with this, please?

1003
01:03:16,341 --> 01:03:17,338
Oh, great!

1004
01:03:19,541 --> 01:03:21,526
You owe me so big.

1005
01:03:21,701 --> 01:03:24,491
Take this. Get out there! Go!

1006
01:03:49,541 --> 01:03:51,338
Sam, your glass is full.

1007
01:04:00,981 --> 01:04:03,980
I only called you because we have to go
to that stupid thing together.

1008
01:04:03,981 --> 01:04:05,460
Right. What are you gonna have?

1009
01:04:05,621 --> 01:04:08,055
- We don't have to do that anymore.
- What? Do what?

1010
01:04:08,221 --> 01:04:10,052
The asking what the other one is having.

1011
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:11,370
We're separated.

1012
01:04:11,981 --> 01:04:13,016
All right.

1013
01:04:29,992 --> 01:04:31,051
- Alright...
- I...

1014
01:04:31,181 --> 01:04:32,455
What? No, I'm sorry.

1015
01:04:32,621 --> 01:04:34,612
No. Pardon me.

1016
01:04:34,613 --> 01:04:35,712
Go ahead.

1017
01:04:35,821 --> 01:04:37,829
This is a hard discussion Grace...

1018
01:04:38,621 --> 01:04:40,416
You know...then let me go first.

1019
01:04:41,821 --> 01:04:44,244
Philip...I've met someone else.

1020
01:04:45,501 --> 01:04:46,297
You have?

1021
01:04:46,461 --> 01:04:49,055
And we're in love,
and I think it's serious.

1022
01:04:49,221 --> 01:04:51,098
I mean, I know it's serious.

1023
01:04:53,501 --> 01:04:56,010
Grace, I'm happy for you. Really.

1024
01:04:57,141 --> 01:04:59,188
That's all you have to say?
You're happy for me?

1025
01:04:59,189 --> 01:05:00,801
No. No.

1026
01:05:00,821 --> 01:05:03,733
It's just that I've met
somebody else too...

1027
01:05:03,741 --> 01:05:06,315
And it's pretty serious.
No, it's definitely serious.

1028
01:05:06,501 --> 01:05:08,059
- It's another woman.
- Yes it is.

1029
01:05:08,221 --> 01:05:10,799
But it didn't happen
before we broke up, I swear.

1030
01:05:10,834 --> 01:05:13,935
No, I'm not talking about you,
you fool. I'm talking about me.

1031
01:05:14,261 --> 01:05:15,895
I'm involved with another woman.

1032
01:05:17,061 --> 01:05:19,871
Champagne refills, please.
"Rápido, rápido", please.

1033
01:05:19,972 --> 01:05:23,283
"Schnell", please. Quickly!
Is everyone here an idiot?

1034
01:05:27,511 --> 01:05:28,689
What are you doing here?

1035
01:05:30,981 --> 01:05:32,778
I'm in charge of refills.

1036
01:05:36,581 --> 01:05:37,875
Come with me.

1037
01:05:40,741 --> 01:05:44,119
How about you work on the meatballs, OK?
Let me just do this.

1038
01:05:44,541 --> 01:05:49,103
- So, you're a lesbian now?
- Yes, I am. And happily.

1039
01:05:49,341 --> 01:05:53,050
With a woman who is interested in me
and all aspects of my life.

1040
01:05:53,661 --> 01:05:56,698
Well, the woman that I'm seeing
takes me for who I am.

1041
01:05:56,861 --> 01:05:59,733
- She loves me unconditionally.
- She must be a saint.

1042
01:06:00,021 --> 01:06:02,619
She's the most unique
person I've ever met.

1043
01:06:02,681 --> 01:06:04,230
She's a totally unconventional woman.

1044
01:06:04,301 --> 01:06:07,555
Well, the woman I've falled in love with
doesn't mind doing things together,

1045
01:06:07,556 --> 01:06:09,307
like a normal couple.

1046
01:06:09,331 --> 01:06:13,073
And we have amazing sex.
All the time.

1047
01:06:13,941 --> 01:06:15,281
Well, we're getting married.

1048
01:06:15,781 --> 01:06:16,770
You're what?!

1049
01:06:17,381 --> 01:06:19,895
- Why are you catering?
- Why are you having an engagement party?

1050
01:06:19,961 --> 01:06:22,839
- Why aren't you at home writing?
- Why are you marrying Jeff?

1051
01:06:22,901 --> 01:06:26,232
Wait. Do you wanna have a fight now?
Is that what's happening here?

1052
01:06:28,101 --> 01:06:31,235
I'm marrying Jeff because
I want someone I can count on.

1053
01:06:31,661 --> 01:06:34,671
- You're out of your mind? You don't love him.
- I do!

1054
01:06:35,021 --> 01:06:39,747
Sort of...and for all his flaws, you know,
at least Jeff wants to try to grow.

1055
01:06:39,748 --> 01:06:44,035
I want to grow too, you know?
And I have...a lot, since we broke up.

1056
01:06:44,341 --> 01:06:45,711
You wouldn't believe the growth!

1057
01:06:46,981 --> 01:06:49,319
- What?
- Samantha?

1058
01:06:49,581 --> 01:06:50,759
What the hell is going on?

1059
01:06:51,221 --> 01:06:53,212
I'm having a private conversation in here.

1060
01:06:53,741 --> 01:06:54,651
With who?

1061
01:06:54,821 --> 01:06:55,723
<i>None of your business.</i>

1062
01:06:58,221 --> 01:07:01,372
With my lesbian ex-lover
if you must know, Jeff.

1063
01:07:01,581 --> 01:07:02,855
Guess what, Philip.

1064
01:07:03,261 --> 01:07:06,173
I'm marrying the woman that I love, too.
We're going to Spain

1065
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:09,383
where gay people
can get married, unlike here.

1066
01:07:11,581 --> 01:07:13,315
I'll make sure to send you an invitation.

1067
01:07:14,941 --> 01:07:17,783
Alright. Have fun in Spain.

1068
01:07:20,181 --> 01:07:21,259
Is Allegra there?

1069
01:07:24,701 --> 01:07:25,956
Get a hammer.

1070
01:07:26,981 --> 01:07:28,545
We're gonna bust this door down.

1071
01:07:28,701 --> 01:07:31,135
I don't really want a girlfriend.

1072
01:07:32,301 --> 01:07:34,337
Stop lying to yourself.

1073
01:07:34,791 --> 01:07:37,187
OK. Well, let me put it like this, then.

1074
01:07:39,861 --> 01:07:42,329
I want a lifetime partner.

1075
01:07:42,501 --> 01:07:44,173
And I can't help it.
That's just how I am.

1076
01:07:44,341 --> 01:07:46,775
And I know you're against
that kind of stuff, and you think it's

1077
01:07:46,941 --> 01:07:49,770
slavery and patriarchy,
and all that kind of stuff.

1078
01:07:49,771 --> 01:07:53,781
But, Allegra...I want to
grow old with someone.

1079
01:07:54,221 --> 01:07:56,940
And that doesn't mean you don't
have a self. It just means...

1080
01:07:57,541 --> 01:08:00,931
that you wanna share yourself
with someone else.

1081
01:08:01,621 --> 01:08:03,304
I don't wanna be with
someone who shuts down

1082
01:08:03,305 --> 01:08:05,773
as soon as she
starts feeling close.

1083
01:08:07,541 --> 01:08:09,407
- I do not do that.
- Yes, you do.

1084
01:08:13,739 --> 01:08:14,959
OK.

1085
01:08:16,141 --> 01:08:16,983
I do.

1086
01:08:19,101 --> 01:08:22,684
But I don't want to...I really, really don't.

1087
01:08:27,581 --> 01:08:28,411
Hold it!

1088
01:08:36,701 --> 01:08:39,468
- I'm not speaking to you.
- I'm not speaking to you.

1089
01:08:42,461 --> 01:08:46,131
Never did like your friend Jeff,
anyway. He's an idiot.

1090
01:08:47,181 --> 01:08:48,773
Just ignore me the whole night,

1091
01:08:48,941 --> 01:08:51,535
and try not to make out
with every woman in the room!

1092
01:08:52,501 --> 01:08:55,652
I can't believe I'm wearing
this stupid outfit.

1093
01:09:00,221 --> 01:09:02,098
I think you look cute.

1094
01:09:27,941 --> 01:09:30,660
I have never seen you this vulnerable.

1095
01:09:32,821 --> 01:09:34,459
It's all your fault.

1096
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:37,700
It's fantastic.

1097
01:09:47,021 --> 01:09:49,029
<i>Sam, I'm going to bust the door down!</i>

1098
01:09:55,221 --> 01:09:56,747
Jeffrey, we need to talk.

1099
01:10:05,141 --> 01:10:06,281
- Allegra!
- Oh my God!

1100
01:10:06,301 --> 01:10:08,610
What are you doing here?
I was just trying to call you.

1101
01:10:08,781 --> 01:10:09,816
Philip, I'm on my way out.

1102
01:10:09,981 --> 01:10:13,098
Oh my God, I've got to talk to you.
I saw Grace tonight.

1103
01:10:13,261 --> 01:10:14,466
That's my ex, you know.

1104
01:10:14,511 --> 01:10:19,075
And...she met somebody else.
She's a lesbian now.

1105
01:10:19,621 --> 01:10:21,851
Can you believe this?
Can you? Can you?

1106
01:10:22,061 --> 01:10:25,053
This is insane. They're gonna get
married in Spain.

1107
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:28,196
I knew that's what she want,
she wanted that, but

1108
01:10:28,221 --> 01:10:30,449
still, it's just such a shock!

1109
01:10:30,621 --> 01:10:32,154
Spain? That's not true.

1110
01:10:32,221 --> 01:10:34,555
She had to tell me how great
the sex was that they had.

1111
01:10:34,621 --> 01:10:38,357
She just throw that in there.
I went a little bit over the deep end.

1112
01:10:38,421 --> 01:10:41,106
Please, tell me you'll marry me,
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

1113
01:10:41,141 --> 01:10:43,530
Allegra, I'm serious. I love you
with all my heart and soul.

1114
01:10:43,701 --> 01:10:46,030
Red! Red! Red!

1115
01:10:46,031 --> 01:10:47,851
- Molly.
- I'm sorry.

1116
01:10:48,061 --> 01:10:51,106
- Philip, what are you doing here?
- Jeff and I went to college together.

1117
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:54,696
Can I just have Allegra
for a quick sec...

1118
01:10:54,697 --> 01:10:56,345
Come here.

1119
01:10:57,101 --> 01:10:59,490
Whatever you do,
do NOT go into the kitchen.

1120
01:11:07,721 --> 01:11:11,839
He met someone else. He met some
woman-saint and he wants to marry her.

1121
01:11:12,701 --> 01:11:14,498
We were together for six years,

1122
01:11:14,661 --> 01:11:16,959
and in five minutes he wants
to marry someone else.

1123
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:17,960
I can't believe it!

1124
01:11:17,981 --> 01:11:21,132
I mean, I don't even want to
marry him, but it's a principle!

1125
01:11:21,301 --> 01:11:22,575
What did you tell him Grace?

1126
01:11:22,741 --> 01:11:24,467
I told him that I'm a lesbian now.

1127
01:11:25,141 --> 01:11:28,115
After meeting you,
I'm a whole new person.

1128
01:11:28,821 --> 01:11:31,051
- Grace, get a hold of yourself!
- I quit my job.

1129
01:11:31,421 --> 01:11:34,955
I wanna be a glass blower.
And I'm gonna get a dog.

1130
01:11:35,221 --> 01:11:36,767
I'll be right back. Wait.

1131
01:11:36,910 --> 01:11:37,983
Allegra!

1132
01:11:39,621 --> 01:11:42,083
Why is she wearing a catering uniform?

1133
01:11:43,501 --> 01:11:44,695
<i>She was so smug</i>

1134
01:11:45,061 --> 01:11:46,712
about her new relationship
with this woman.

1135
01:11:46,713 --> 01:11:49,884
She was going on and on about it,
and I just...I felt so angry!

1136
01:11:50,101 --> 01:11:52,296
OK. Then, what happened?

1137
01:11:52,461 --> 01:11:53,917
She ran out of the restaurant.

1138
01:11:54,281 --> 01:11:56,492
- You ran after her?
- No, no.

1139
01:11:56,661 --> 01:11:59,860
You were with a woman who ran out of
a restaurant after an argument,

1140
01:11:59,861 --> 01:12:01,355
and you didn't run after her?

1141
01:12:01,861 --> 01:12:04,170
No! What was I supposed to do?

1142
01:12:04,341 --> 01:12:07,414
When a woman runs out of a restaurant,
that's your cue to get up and run after her.

1143
01:12:08,541 --> 01:12:11,758
- Whose side are you on, anyway?
- Not on anyone's side!

1144
01:12:17,393 --> 01:12:18,436
Allegra!

1145
01:12:27,981 --> 01:12:29,687
How do you know her?

1146
01:12:30,501 --> 01:12:31,736
That's my girlfriend.

1147
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:40,281
Your what?!

1148
01:12:46,628 --> 01:12:52,332
Philip, I met Grace after I met you.

1149
01:12:53,301 --> 01:12:54,575
I had no idea you...

1150
01:12:55,621 --> 01:12:58,614
you two were ex's.
I had no idea...

1151
01:12:58,615 --> 01:13:03,696
I was gonna end up...
seeing both of you.

1152
01:13:07,701 --> 01:13:10,295
It got complicated,

1153
01:13:10,581 --> 01:13:11,616
and it was like...

1154
01:13:12,261 --> 01:13:16,542
being on a moving train
that...couldn't stop.

1155
01:13:27,661 --> 01:13:29,174
Some people wanna find someone...

1156
01:13:30,901 --> 01:13:32,459
they can grow old with.

1157
01:13:33,421 --> 01:13:36,019
I didn't understand that before now.

1158
01:13:38,621 --> 01:13:41,135
It makes total sense,

1159
01:13:42,381 --> 01:13:44,762
even if it takes
going through hell to get there.

1160
01:13:45,901 --> 01:13:46,910
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

1161
01:13:48,141 --> 01:13:49,351
I'm so sorry.

1162
01:13:49,861 --> 01:13:52,250
I didn't mean...to hurt anyone...

1163
01:15:06,981 --> 01:15:09,290
<i>The reason Freud thought
there were no coincidences</i>

1164
01:15:09,461 --> 01:15:12,578
<i>is because we're always
more aware than we think we are.</i>

1165
01:15:13,821 --> 01:15:15,770
<i>We think we just
run into someone but, in fact,</i>

1166
01:15:15,971 --> 01:15:18,771
<i>we might have seen him out of the
corner of our eye earlier that day.</i>

1167
01:15:18,941 --> 01:15:20,656
<i>We just didn't register it.</i>

1168
01:15:22,781 --> 01:15:25,600
<i>Once something lodges itself
in your unconscious</i>

1169
01:15:25,601 --> 01:15:28,546
<i>it's just there,
pleading to be realized.</i>

1170
01:15:34,501 --> 01:15:35,490
<i>So,</i>

1171
01:15:35,741 --> 01:15:39,495
<i>this was the last coincidence
I had with Philip and Grace.</i>

1172
01:15:45,201 --> 01:15:47,367
<i>It was also the last time
I ever saw them.</i>

1173
01:15:53,821 --> 01:15:58,480
<i>I never again left anything
in my life just to chance.</i>

1174
01:16:24,221 --> 01:16:25,859
<i>A poet once wrote:</i>

1175
01:16:26,541 --> 01:16:29,135
<i>"The Heart is the capital of the Mind"</i>

1176
01:16:29,581 --> 01:16:32,095
<i>"The Mind is a single State"</i>

1177
01:16:32,741 --> 01:16:36,814
<i>"The Heart and the Mind together make
A single Continent."</i>

1178
01:16:38,861 --> 01:16:42,082
<i>"A single Continent", it's just such a great
concept when you think about it.</i>

1179
01:16:43,501 --> 01:16:45,093
<i>Emily Dickinson.</i>

1180
01:16:45,501 --> 01:16:46,650
Emily Dickinson?

1181
01:16:46,821 --> 01:16:48,652
- She wrote it.
- Are you sure?

1182
01:16:48,821 --> 01:16:51,945
Honey, if she says so,
you can take it to the bank.

1183
01:16:52,221 --> 01:16:53,000
Really?

1184
01:16:53,541 --> 01:16:55,170
I just get Emily Dickinson
confused with the other one

1185
01:16:55,171 --> 01:16:57,340
the one who stayed home all the time.

1186
01:16:57,341 --> 01:16:59,439
- Emily Dickinson.
- Emily Dickinson!

1187
01:16:59,541 --> 01:17:02,451
What about the Brontë's, didn't the
Brontë's stay home all the time too?

1188
01:17:02,452 --> 01:17:03,679
Hey, honey.

1189
01:17:06,781 --> 01:17:08,931
- Sorry I'm late.
- No, you're not late.

1190
01:17:09,101 --> 01:17:12,173
- I got you maccaroni and cheese.
- You're such a good girlfriend.

1191
01:17:12,621 --> 01:17:15,215
- So, how did it go today?
- I got ten pages down.

01:17:15,381 --> 01:17:16,416
That's great!

1193
01:17:16,581 --> 01:17:18,040
Did you ever read any Emily Dickinson?

1194
01:17:18,041 --> 01:17:20,220
Al...you know I hate poetry.

1195
01:17:21,141 --> 01:17:22,096
Yeah...yeah.

1196
01:17:23,181 --> 01:17:24,637
I love that about you.

1197
01:17:24,981 --> 01:17:26,978
I love you. I love you totally.

1198
01:17:27,181 --> 01:17:29,758
Good. I love you too, and...

1199
01:17:29,821 --> 01:17:32,433
there's tons of laundry to do later
and I'm not doing it alone, so...

1200
01:17:34,861 --> 01:17:39,063
What do you say we stay in tonight
and watch an old movie?
