This is Mr. Perelman.



For 47 years,
he's been getting up at 5.45 am.



By 6.20, he's already showered,



and before 7.00,
he's bought the newspaper.



He's a lawyer.
And he's my father.



At 7.15, cafe latte and croissants.



Perelman senior
thinks a man is free



when he can have his breakfast



and read the paper
without having to talk to anyone.



Maybe even buy something,
but always in silence.



At 7.30, he starts his rounds
in Court.



He knows which courts to go to
first and which ones later.



He knows the birthdays
and anniversarles



of all the secretaries,
which candles they like,



and the favorite soccer team
of the lift operator.



Doctor!
There's some room here!



I値l be right back.



Tizzles or Amelli?



- Sand?
- Tizzles is injured.



Sand, you think? The 4th floor?.
Marta's birthday. Court 8.



- What about ''La Gata''?
- He was a crack in Racing...



Dr. Perelman
doesn't stand in line



and he's developed
his own system



to avoid any kind of waiting.



At 11.20, he takes a break
in an underground cafeteria.



it痴 time for a cheese
and tomato sandwich.



Modesto is your husband?



My partner.



That's fine. It's just a detail.



He uses those fifteen minutes
to meet with a client.



He says some of them
are intimidated by offices...



That's why there are some clients
for the cafe



and others for the office.



Tell me.



What are you growing now?
Is it broccoli?



They took out the gear box before...



Perelman
is a Zelig among lawyers.



He immediately picks up
the speech,



manners and semantics
of his clients.



He likes to see them
in their natural habitat.



A leak here...
I値l take out the gear box.



Have a mate.



Not on purpose.
That's just the way he is.



He knows a bit about every trade.



I heard your message.



She's Norita.



She's been dad's secretary
since mom died.



She earns 860 pesos a month,



but Perelman
always rounds it up to 1,000.



She arrives at 3.30
and leaves at 8.45 pm,



the same routine
or the last 15 years.



Ever since l can remember,
the ''R'' has been missing here.



But Perelman says
people understand it anyway.



Norita and l get along well,
but l don't know much about her.



l saw her outside the office once.



At a funeral. Very uncomfortable.



Sometimes it's uncomfortable
to see people out of context.



Any news?



Ms. Ducatti called twice.



You have a sore throat?



No big deal.



I didn't know
what to wear today.



I couldn稚 decide: raincoat or...



The decoration of the office
is representative of dad's taste,



which is actually a combination
of all his clients' taste.



There's also
a second bathroom



doubling as an archive
and a kitchen.



A meeting room
where nobody ever met.



Did the form arrive?



And the heart of the firm.<i>:</i>
the attorney's office.



Why a kettle?



I went by a store
and saw this electric kettle,



and you can boll water,
for tea, mate...



And this is the second office.
it was supposed to be for me.



But it's not.



in this firm, there's no place
for another Perelman.



...and that's why the evidence,
in a penal Lawsuit...



That's me, Mr. Perelman.
Also a lawyer.



But l didn't go for Law.
l went for Justice.



Right now I知 lecturing.



At this hour,
l mostly get young girls,



and they dress so well
it barely seems like 7 am.



But we don't notice that.



At night it's different.
There are bearded men



who will never graduate.



...or in American movies
about lawyers.



Or in much-talked about cases,



Like the recent one
about the pop singer



accused
of sexually abusing minors,



sleeping with kids, you know.



In this case, the Jury decides
whether he's guilty or innocent,



without the need
to substantiate anything.



Hi, I'm from the Students' Union.



I don't know if you're aware



of the near extinction of
the Emperor Penguin in our country.



We're collecting signatures
to put an end to it.



You can sign outside.
I'm from the Ecology Commission.



Please, do sign.
Today, it's the penguins,



tomorrow, it could be us.



Let's all make a commitment.



Could you come back after class?
We don't have enough time now.



Who the fuck are you
to kick me out?



I'm the professor in charge here.



You are Perelman.



Don't you remember me?
You fuck up people痴 lives!



I never graduated
because of you!



What did I do to you?



What do you do for people,
Perelman?



- We'd appreciate it if you left now.
- Faggot!



Let's pretend nothing happened.



Or better yet, let's pretend
something did happen.



Tell me
what that man was wearing.



A tracksuit
or brown corduroy?



-A tracksuit, I think.
-A tracksuit?



But I think it was brown.



You think it was brown.



Did he put his hands on the desk?



Yes, both hands, I believe.



Are you positive?



You're not sure, are you?



Could you describe
the state that man was in?



He seemed half-crazy.



Half-crazy
or three-quarters-crazy?



In any case, he wouldn稚 be
totally crazy. Tough one, right?



Where did he take
the pamphlets from?



From an army satchel.



From an army satchel?
Army-brown?



Army-green, Left-hand side.



Good eyesight.
He was pretty far away.



l have a student named Sandra.



The only first name l remember.
The rest are just last names.



She sits in the back,
as if trying to be invisible.



impossible.
Sandra will be my wife.



Not now that she's a student.



But l enjoy her listening to me.
That motivates me.



Every day, judges decide
based on testimonies...



from witnesses
as accurate or inaccurate as you.



And the destines of many people
depend on those witnesses.



Tell me
what that man sold to me.



Come on, give it a try.



Faggot.



Faggot or maggot?



- Faggot.
- So he did...



Is calling someone a faggot
a crime?



Tough one, I know...



But the following day Sandra didn't
come to class. Nor the day after.



You know the address?



That one or this one?



That one.



- The fitting room?
- Sure.



- Does it suit you?
- It's OK, I Like a loose fit.



You want me to take a look?



No, it's perfect. I値l take it.



it turned out we were colleagues.
She was also into teaching.



She was a Pilates instructor.



- I changed before coming.
- Great.



Taking a few classes
seemed like the best excuse.



Or perhaps, it wasn't.



The first class
was somewhat uncomfortable.



Until a few days ago,
l was Mr. Perelman,



high up on the pedestal
of knowledge.



And now l was just a body
starting its decline.



That's it, we start relaxing...



She showed me how to breathe
and tighten my belly and thighs.



Let your waist relax....
And then expand...



We were alone,
but pretended not to notice.



We only talked about things
related to the posture of my back.



- It feels good, right?
- Yeah.



- Like this?
- Yes, let it go... Like that.



Well, I think
that's enough for today.



That is... if you agree.



Excuse me.



When the class was over,



l felt an irrepressible desire
to put on my suit and be normal.



Each time we exhale,
we feel more relaxed.



And we really enjoy it,



as we feel the back relaxing.



Now I値l pull you
and you just Let yourself go.



Now... exhale.



At first, l felt Sandra touched me
in a special way.



But the method itself



involved special care
for all its students.



After a short while,
Sandra dropped out of school,



so l had to keep going
to her place,



trapped in her Pilates world.



it was the only way
to keep in touch.



l never dared tell her anything.



You can't declare
your love to a woman



while you're sweating
and tightening your thighs.



But l started
doing the exercises better,



and took the air
to any part of the body.



Through the nose, I know.



Through the nose...



Joseph Pilates was once
a prisoner in a concentration camp.



He wanted to strengthen
his comrades' muscles.



But he only had springs
from mattresses...



And without realizing it,



he started developing
the Pilates Method.



Let me show you something.



This is right, and this is wrong.



- This is wrong?
- Yeah.



It seemed perfect to me.



It's cold.



- It's iced tea.
- It's meant to be cold?



You stand Like this.



Yeah, maybe...



No, you stand Like this.



You have to stand Like that.



But that's going
to take me a while.



Isn't it a bit painful
to stand Like that?



Which one is yours?



Luckily, one day Sandra had
a little problem with the Law.



And l was able to take her out
of her world, to a safer place.



Please be careful.
They are very fragile.



The springs are imported.



- Don't you worry.
- Thank you.



- This one is for you.
- OK.



Good morning. How are you doing?
I'm Dr. Perelman.



A lawyer in a tracksuit?
That's weird. Excuse me.



What happened?



Sandra had a problem with
the Law of Trademarks and Patents.



The Pilates Method
was registered by a company



with the rights
for the entire country.



Poor thing, she was desperate.



She thought it was like
teaching swimming or music.



It's not going to be fast,
It's not going to be easy, but...



Defense Lawyer for the Poor
Office No. 5



l didn't know where to start.
l could tell right from wrong,



but not what the Law
could do for Sandra.



l went to see Perelman senior
at Astorga's pizza place.



He's a client
with many restaurants downtown,



always in trouble
...hygiene problems.



Here it says they took a sample of
spaghetti sauce with live insects.



Your own employee
signed as a witness.



But I also kept a sample.



The guy is always in trouble



so he pays dad a fixed fee
to deal with the law.



And dad also gets to eat for free.



As Perelman senior says.<i>:</i>
in the end, it all adds up.



He drafted the writ on a
tissue napkin that l still keep.



We didn't have to pay for dinner.
Astorga treated me too.



Can you heat it up?
But, please, not in the microwave.



- What are you drinking?
- Just water.



Before being a prisoner
in a concentration camp,



Joseph Pilates was a sickly boy
who suffered from rheumatic fever,



so he studied human anatomy



and how to strengthen
his own body through exercising.



Though for a while, only dancers
were interested in the method,



Pilates had already started his
work as a skilled technician



in physical rehabilitation.



Joseph Pilates.



It's him? Is he alive?



No, he died. He worked...



- Four eyes.
- ...in World War ll.



Here you have scoliosis.
And down here, you have lordosis.



Does it feel better
when I do this?



We have to work on your spine,



and also on your abs.



It's the tracksuit,
it's too Loose.



Grow from here.



Will you copy it yourself?
You understand the handwriting?



Thanks.



According to the precedent
cited in the above paragraph...



Have you always been
Left-handed?



- Yeah.
- It'd slipped my mind.



Teaching Pilates illegally.



Fake Pilates instructor
files lawsuit.



Pilates case.<i>:</i>
intense negotiation.



A toast.
Everything will turn out fine.



We have to make eye contact.



Later on,
Justice proved we were right.



Our ruling freed Pilates
for all Argentina.



Sandra went on with her business
and l married her.



Gentlemen, the springs
are finely tuned.



Be careful.



Sandra, move over.
Can I help you, guys?



Hands up!



l didn't charge her anything.



But we went Dutch
on the wedding party.



l never told her that Perelman
senior helped me with the trial.



She still believes l pulled it off.



l sometimes wonder if this lie



would be grounds
for a marriage annulment.



What is it, darling?
You want daddy?



Daddy?



I'm looking at him.
I'm right here.



Now that we're a family



and have a son,
the picture's quite normal.



it痴 seems very natural.
But l know it isn't.



Hooking up with Sandra
was some kind of a miracle.



We never stopped decorating
since our honeymoon.



And it seems to go on forever.



Sandra wanted
to refurbish the house



so she could work
and be a mother at the same time.



We currently live together
with the painters,



an ironworker
and the guy who does the floors.



My son sometimes
calls one of them ''daddy''.



-Are you painting, Gaston?
- It's blue.



No. The seat is blue.



- What color is the wheel?
- This is blue.



What color is the wheel?



Beige 27 4?



What is it? Poo?
He wants to poo.



No, Sandra, not me, not poo.



He wants to poo, Perelman!



Again?
But he pooed this morning!



it痴 weird. in the mornings,
l run into gentlemen



that come to my house.
My wife doesn't touch them much.



There are also ladles,



who try to make friends
with my wife.



I知 not into Pilates.
it gives me vertigo.



But sometimes,
when my wife and son are sleeping,



l sit on the bed
and do some exercises.



l think about how l became
a family man,



and what it would have been like
if l had not.



But l soon feel like going to bed.



Perelman,
take off the suit to sleep.



Then you complain it's all creased.



Don't you remember
where Mom put it?



She put it away! It's gone!



What do you mean it's gone?



It's not here.



No, it's in the closet.
But where did she put it?



- Where? Here?
- Over there.



- It's not here.
- It's there!



- Here?
-Yes.



There's nothing here.
I don't have all day, Gaston.



- Where?
- Down there.



No, the other one.



- Where?
- There it is.



There's nothing here!



- Tell me where it is.
- I don't know.



Now, start breathing.



Take the breath
into the stomach.



That's right.



Into the stomach,
right here...



That's right...all in here.



Now, hold the air in...



You keep going.



Nice job...right?



You're going to be late.



What does Gaston wear
for the kindergarten?



- Did you buy the uniform?
- First drawer?



- I checked the third drawer.
- First one.



Keep breathing folks!



- Because if they don't...
- They'll die.



- I've told this joke before?
- Repeatedly, over two years.



I値l just drop him there
and leave.



- Or should I stay with him?
- He's already adapted.



Then I値l just drop him there.



Watch it, it'll get dirty.



What's this badge?



What's this badge?



Did they tell you what it meant?



Did they tell you what it meant?



I want more cards for the album.



More?



- Ponce, what happened?
- The masonry collapsed.



Oases will be postponed
for thirty days.



And the files?



They're being submitted
to the Courts.



Now you'll have time
to get a hair cut.



Perelman, they won't Let you in.



The structure collapsed
due to the weight of the files.



The building has to close.



All my things are inside.



Did you try the cafeteria?



What's up?
The building痴 falling down on us.



Are you going on holidays?



No, no.
I want to take my things out



before it all falls down.



Can稚 you Let me in?
Through there?



That way.



Bye.



I値l have another coffee later on.



Good morning, Doctor.



Treat the good man
with respect please.



- Your wife knows already?
- Knows what?



That you have a month's holiday.



- No, why?
- Take advantage of it!



You put on your suit,
goodbye my love,



and have some time
for ''your things''.



Darmidjian, I won't lie to my wife
for no reason.



If I ever have ''a thing'',
then you can give me some advice.



I値l be needing you next week,
but to play ''the resented guy''.



- I have this new course...
- No, I don't do that anymore.



- ''No''?
- That was just a favor.



What are you telling me?



People really buy it.
They are genuinely moved.



I mean it! Pedagogically,
it's really something...



The professors take it
as an example.



- My colleagues tease me.
- They don't!



- What are they saying?
- O'mon-Garcllazo-we-can-make-it.



Garcllazo is the jockey,
and ''we-can-make-it''



means we really want him to win.



It's the spirit of the turf.



O'mon-Garcllazo-we-can-make-it!



Which horse did you bet on?



Garcllazo's, all of it.



It's over.



-Are you seeing your kids?
- Yes, yes...



Everything is OK.
Half an hour a day belongs to them.



In that sense,
the pediatrician is right:



nothing beats quality time.



And this one?



Forget it.
It's pure Italian Jacquard.



Is it a gift?



Yes.



...and that has more to do
with our ambitions as Lawyers,



with our dreams, if you will.



Dreams
in two senses of the word.



On the one side,
there's the Lawyer I dream to be.



I might want to be
a successful Lawyer



and I don't care about
the amount of truth I deal in.



But, perhaps,
you're interested in the truth.



It's the main reason,
the essence of your calling.



Sandra...



There's a problem
in the building...



No, it's just for today,
something with the water.



No big deal.



They think it's just for today.



I thought of picking up Gaston
from the kindergarten.



And taking him to the Zoo...



What do you mean he's having
swimming Lessons?



Why teach him that now?
He's two and a half years old!



Well, I can teach him to swim
when he turns thirteen.



It's just for today.
He can skip swimming.



OK, fine... bye, sweetheart.



- Who wants the piggy?
- I want it!



Here it is.



It's so good you came
to pick him up.



Kids Like it when daddy
comes to pick them up.



This belongs to him,



because today he pooed,
without warning.



But that's normal, right?



- But of course.
- There's no hurry.



It's normal.



We try to make them feel
it's normal.



Sometimes
they feel embarrassed.



So we tell them:
mommy pooes, daddy pooes,



we all poo, right?



I don't know if you read about
the party on the bulletin board.



- Not really.
- We are preparing a play,



to get to know each other better,
through theater,



so all the daddies can participate.



No, I'm very shy.
I can't do it.



- We'll all participate.
-Anyway, I think it's great....



- We値l all dress-up as buffoons.
- No, I won't do it.



But it's very important.



Like I sold, I think it's great
they do things Like that, but...



But all the dads plan to take part.



There he is!
Hernan, our counselor.



You're Gaston's father, right?



The twins' parents are downstairs?



Yes, I値l be right with them.



- Good bye.
- See you Later.



Hernan's a professional.



He could help you
with your communication problem...



What communication problems?



...and in that way,
they had lots of energy.



- Hello.
- Good afternoon.



So, as I was telling you:



all animals had Lots of energy
and they could run and run



through the woods.
The woods were huge.



There were Lots of animals.



- It comes with caramel?
- No.



This one?



You want this one?



If it comes with caramel.
But you can't tell me that, can you?



- Can you tell me or not?
- No, no caramel.



Hello. How are you?



We're from the university.



Sure.
Hello. How are you doing?



- Is he yours?
- Yes, he is.



We didn't think you'd have kids.



Why not?



Because in the university
you Look so carefree.



But, he looks Like you,
a little bit.



- He's very cute.
- He likes milk. How cute.



Say hello to the girls.
They're daddy's students.



Hold it a second.



- We don't mean to bother you.
- Not at all.



Hello.



Son?



- Perelman, what's up?
- How are you doing?



- Fine, fine.
- Did you eat already?



No, not yet.



Come to Astorga's diner.



Not the one on Florida,
they closed it down.



Today?
I have a thousand things...



Take a cab, I値l pay for it.



I don't need you to pay for it.
I'm on my way.



- See you.
- See you Later.



- Is he coming?
-Yes.



Leave Norita's swan alone.



It's very strange, Sandra.
He never calls at noon.



What if he has a serious problem?
I can't say no.



Take Gaston to see grandpa.



But I'm going to Astorga's.
He can't sit on the floor.



It's contaminated.
That's no place for a kid.



Can稚 I drop him back
at the kindergarten?



Didn't he have swimming classes?



He's not a package you pick up



and then drop off
whenever you want.



Now it's Late for swimming.
It's all planned in advance.



Everything's organized



so we can get on
with our Lives and enjoy our son.



Why do you mess it all up?



I could take care of him.



It's just for a short while,
and these guys are reliable.



Fine. Let Gerardo
take care of your son.



Do you really agree?



Go see your dad,
it must be important.



You mean it? You won't hold it
against me afterwards?



What do you think?



- It's fine, if you think it's fine too.
- I won't tell you.



We're trying to agree on something.
The painter痴 a reliable guy.



We know him better than
Gaston's teacher.



Do you know where she Lives?



Hi, how are you doing?



We're done
with the back exercises.



Trouble with the spark plug?



It's a turbo diesel,
it has injectors instead.



The noise comes
from the brake cartridges.



Yeah.
This is one nice motorcar!



With diesel you gotta be saving
a bundle of cash, right?



Not really, with one liter
I can do 300 km,



but the mechanic
costs an arm and a leg.



I gotta use natural gas.
You use gasoline?



Are you nuts? No way, man.
I did the math a thousand times.



The insurance, the gasoline,
the mechanic, the parking,



I'm not even breaking even...
It's way better to take a cab,



and so you deal with all the crap.



I pay you and you deal with it.



And why are you taking funny?



Let's see how we're doing
with Inchaustegui's debt.



Uncle Eduardo is dad's brother.



He's also a lawyer,
but with a different specialization.



He has a company
called ''Bad Debtors''.



When the arm of the Law
doesn't reach dad,



then Uncle Eduardo takes charge,
because his arm is longer.



He plays golf on Sundays.



Give him ''Operative Discredit''.



The system's simple. lf you don't
pay, Uncle Eduardo ruins your life.



You just call him



and Uncle Eduardo meets you
in a very discreet office,



and very kindly, he helps you out.



Oddly enough, nobody ever tried
to ruin his life.



He even has many ex-bad debtors
among his friends.



The thing with Marechal...



The mute one, right?
Is it coming along?



Fine, we hung out a banner:
''Marechal, fucker, pay your debt.''



Yes, I know the text.



- Now give him a call.
- Right now?



At lunch time,
when he's with his family, why not?



- Something else?
- Yes, Vignola...



Especially made for the attorney.



Some trips must be done
because investments...



We値l switch it back
to the news Later.



Shh MFker c'mon, a Little more
and we break the 1.30...



Mamune, one of these days
you値l have to start working...



- We値l see about that.
- How much money to get in?



Let's say 10,000,
as collateral.



Uncle Mamune isn't dad's brother.
He was his first regular client.



So l call him ''uncle''.



...we open a bank account:
Liverpool, the Caymans,



Gibraltar, you name it.



Uncle Mamune
started making a little profit



by buying and selling dollars
in exchange houses.



Now he does the same,
but has a private financial company.



Now he's playing against the euro.



Around 30ｰ/o.



If you play against the market,
you値l never win.



You start with 30ｰ/o
on the minus side.



We Lawyers
don't charge commissions.



We charge fees when we win.



We see life
through a different lens.



Not always.



I'm also a Lawyer
and I have a fixed income,



whether I defend one absentee
or five hundred.



How about that?



In my law firm, we pay better.
Bear that in mind.



- Do you know how much I make?
- Stop fucking around.



You should go work
with your old man.



You just Like fooling around
with your students.



- Not any more.
- Mamune, pass me the soda water.



Nice chicks at school, right?



Yes, nice chicks.



And the bread, please.



You're a bit demanding today...



He wants to give you something
in return for your consideration.



A small bottle of something.



-Anything else?
- No, thanks.



It's the end of the year,
and everybody wants their cut.



It's only May, Eduardo.



It was a figure of speech,
Perelman.



-Attorney...
- Ramon...



Can I come in?



Fine, we'll talk Later then.



- How's Ramon doing?
- Fine.



He's happy.



They ruled lack of merit
in his case for false testimony.



Get yourself another witness.
Ramon is burned out.



He's seen all the car accidents
of the last 5 years in town.



I say: ''Take a vacation'',
but he won't.



He really likes going to the courts.



Judges find him formidable.



And we need someone reliable.
Do you have anyone?



Do you know what
he did the other day?



He was testifying in the case
of the Plaza Italia accident,



a man and his granddaughter
were ran over by a bus and killed.



The judge
remembered seeing Ramon



testifying in another case



that happened at the same time,
but somewhere else.



Ramon was poker-faced.



Do they clean these snails?



Yes, Astorga knows
how they do it. Astorga!



How do they clean these snails?



They clean them in a solution
of salty water, for a week.



And so they're clean to eat.



Did you know that snails
are hermaphrodites?



And the pork too, Astorga?



No, the pork is heterosexual.



Excuse me,
I'm going to the bathroom.



Astorga, can you bring
some water with Lemon.



He forgot.



You dumbshit, don't you know
what day it is today?



- Yes, Wednesday.
- Which Wednesday?



No, today's the 13th.



Yes, we're celebrating
his birthday.



Did you bring
a present or anything?



No, I totally forgot.



- But this is your present.
- I have tons, from clients.



Come on,
write him something nice.



- He's turning 65 today, no Less.
- Yes, I know.



I'd better go or they値l think
I'm some sort of pussy.



Thank you for the coffee.



- Happy birthday.
- Thanks a lot.



Please...



...it's nothing.



There you go!
It Looks Like a Montblanc.



- Very useful.
- What a nice present, right?



- Happy birthday.
- Thanks a lot, son.



It's OK.



Sweetheart...



Sweetheart...



I forgot about it.



Today was Perelman痴 birthday,
and I totally forgot about it.



How could that happen?
What kind of a son am I?



I can't forget my dad's birthday.



Didn't you remember it?



Don't worry.



On Saturday
it's your son's birthday.



I'm telling you in advance,
so don't forget it.



Sandra, how could I forget
my son's birthday?



But you told me
you'd take care of everything,



so I didn't think about it.



I値l blow out the candles
and you値l handle the rest.



The snacks, the balloons...



The entertainers.



- The entertainers are coming?
- Yes, both.



Paullina and Marcela, right?



Yes, the ones you Like so much.



And the buffoons,
are the buffoons coming?



- What is a buffoon anyway?
- I don't really know,



but today, at the kindergarten,



they asked me
to dress up as one.



The teacher told me
he's integrating really well.



- Is that right?
-Yes.



I wanted to talk to you about it.



Did you know our son goes
to a Swiss kindergarten?



It's affiliated
with the Swiss College.



Couldn稚 you tell
when we enrolled him?



No. But why give our son
a Swiss education!



Your ancestors are Spaniards
and mine are Polish.



We're the typical Argentine
Judeo-Christian married couple.



When did the Swiss
enter our Lives?



The kindergarten is nearby,
and he's on a scholarship.



If you want, next year
we値l find another one.



Walt, hold it,
Let痴 see how he integrates.



I can't keep taking, Sandra.
I need to get some sleep.



Besides, the Swiss are very neat,
and well educated.



Do you know what they did
during the Second World War?.



Are you going to sleep
in your suit?



Tomorrow,
I値l ask the principal about that.



Let's hear what he says.



But if you don't teach your kid



how to relate properly
to other kids...



-Are you OK?
-Yes.



Did you invite Norita?



She gets along great with kids...



You want eggs?



How are you? You Look terrific!



Check out the Little mouse.



Do you know her?



The Little mouse, yes.



The same entertainer as always.



When I was young,
we didn't have entertainers.



It was just after the war.



The war had nothing to do with it.



- Did you tell her?
- What?



That you are not working.



And how do you know?



- Did you tell her?
- I didn't have the chance.



Then, on Monday, the two of us
will spend the day together,



we値l do the Court rounds.



Why? Do you need a witness?



No, no,
I've trained Ramon for that.



Dad, Listen to me,
you know what I do for a Living?



I'm a Public Official,



I can't do the Court rounds
with you, it doesn't Look good.



You're free on Monday.



We can spend the day together.



And you値l meet people,
that's always useful.



Useful for what? What people?
I don't need to meet people, dad.



Why did you buy Gaston a ball?



What did you want me to buy?



A tale? He's a kid. A ball is fine.



Sure it's fine.
It just seems weird.



You and I don't Like soccer.
Will you take him to the stadium?



Kids need things to play with.
A ball is fine.



Should I buy an electric razor?



What time on Monday?



At 7:15, cafe Latte and croissants.



I need a sensitive
and brave man.



- Him!
- No, no.



Yes, go ahead!



I don't know if...



Happy birthday to you!



Happy birthday to you!



Happy birthday, dear Gaston!



Happy birthday, dear Doctor!



Happy birthday to you!



Happy birthday, dear Bernardo!
Happy birthday to you!



Bravo!



Mommy!



Daddy!



Perelman!



- Sandra, you go.
- No, you go.



No, you go.
I did it Last Sunday.



You go, get him dressed,
take him to the park,



and you can read the entire paper,
with all the supplements.



- Take advantage of it.
- No, you go.



A study says fathers take better
care of their good looking children



Gaston!
Don't go any further!



Stay close to daddy!



Where they are...



Don't pick things up from
the floor! No, don't do it!



There you go!



Go to the other one.



That one is nice.



You Like that one, right?



I don't want it.



Gaston!



Grandpa!



Since when are you into jogging?



I started... today.



And I'm not into jogging, I just
walk fast, so I don't ruin my knees.



You値l ruin your knees
if you don't check with a doctor.



He's not into soccer.



No.



It must be genetic.



But he's into drawing.
Perhaps he値l be an artist.



He draws really well.



He値l be an architect.



What?



What's up, Gaston?



Draw a turtle for grandpa.



He's moody.



Is something wrong?



You're coming tomorrow, right?



Yes, I told you I would.



Did I tell you about
the Swiss school?



We're sending Gaston
to a nearby school.



At the kindergarten,



they asked me
to dress up as a buffoon.



I pay them to dress up Gaston,
not me.



When l was a kid,
Perelman senior didn't take me



to the movies or the Zoo.



instead, we'd get together
and do the Court rounds.



Have a sandwich and listen to him
talk with colleagues.



l'd carry his briefcase,
made of chamois leather,



quite similar
to the one he has now.



Perhaps it's even the same.
The overcoat is the same.



-And Gallardo? What do you think?
- Yeah, sure.



Sure?



- The master, right?
- The master!



- The 4th floor?.
- Yes, the 4th.



Who's next?



Justice



Law



...they specialize in growing
cauliflower and broccoli.



And they also grow
first-rate snails for haute cuisine.



But what do you want?
To win the case or to be right?



She was taking on a cell phone
while driving, with the dog.



Here's the supermarket.
You went Looking for a job.



You were standing there,
and suddenly hear the noise.



You Look and see the accident.



What did you see?
It was raining.



What did you see?
Do you remember?.



I went to the supermarket
Looking for a job,



I was walking
along Bulnes street,



and saw the white car
coming from the Left.



And saw the lady in the van,
with the dog inside?



This is Ramirez-OarmeIa,
but this is another Ramirez.



Married? What a shame.
Don't you have one that's single?



You never told us about him.



I'm single and all alone.



l spend the rest of the morning
meeting people who, as he says,



are people worth meeting.



The secretaries enjoyed finding
similarities between father and son.



Of course he's grown up.



He's a university professor.



Official Defense Lawyer.



Worthy of you.



Mora...
Was it Matllde or Oarlos?



Mora, without an ''h''.
Mortgage Foreclosure.



Let's go to another building,
three blocks from here.



...and they grow them there,
in Derqui...



The best cakes in the Court area.



Mr. Perelman!



What a coincidence!



- Echechuny!
- How you doing, Attorney?



At snack time we met Echechuny,
a legendary client of Perelman's.



Echechuny
was one of those last names



that always showed up at home,



clients who became
great legends.



- Echechuny, radio announcer.
- Yes, I remember.



Weren't you in that documentary
about migrating birds?



Long time ago, long time ago.



No, it was the commercial
for Domain.



''Time passes
and the clothes remain''.



You remember?
But it wasn't exactly Like that.



It was: ''Garments Domain, time
passes, yet the clothes remain.''



Taking about clothes,
remember Angellni Taylors?



l have a brand new suit
for this coming summer,



it's chic and refined enough
to make me look like a newcomer.



And I'd follow saying: ''Angellni
Taylors, the typical Italian style.''



I also remember
the one about Femandez's Balls,



''Small balls, big balls,
Fernandez has them all''.



''Fernandez Sports, located
on Sarmlento and Uruguay''.



- Come and bust our balls!
- It wasn't Like that!



The meeting was already over.



We could've left and eaten
the sandwich somewhere else.



But Perelman senior
used 5 extra minutes of his life



to make Echechuny feel good.



Five more minutes went by



and Perelman
had already forgotten



about Echechuny
and his problems.



He has an area of his memory
that is strictly short-term.



Exclusively for clients
and their problems.



Like those magic blackboards
my son uses in the kindergarten.



Son?



You have to do me a favor.



- Tell me...
- Listen...



There's this optician,
on Lavalle street...



I ordered new glasses,
go and pick them up, please.



But...



I have...
I just can't make it...



Have something to eat
and I値l see you at the office.



But, we were supposed
to have Lunch together...



Bernardo Perelman and Son.
Law Firm.



Then Uriarte called,
that thing with the chickens.



- Isn't it Allerza?
- No, no, it's Uriarte.



I have the folder right here,



...and there's the terrible case
of a teenager murdered in a disco.



- Is the tea cold already?
- No, it's fine.



- Is your throat better?.
-Yes.



I've been taking honey candles.



- What are you doing?
- I'm packing.



You're Leaving me?



Don't be such a moron.



I'm going camping
with the Pilates group.



I told you a thousand times.
You have a memory problem.



No, no, Machu Picchu.



Remember
I showed you the photos?



''3 days' walking, come on!''



- Yes, but... when is it?
- We're Leaving tomorrow.



No, I thought it was next week!



Perelman, take it easy.



Don't give me
your ''Perelman Look''.



People from all over America.
A Guru will teach us



how to breathe
from the school of Ravi Shankar.



- The bearded guy with the guitar.
- No, that's his son.



-And the fatsos are coming?
- Yes, they are.



Fabio's coming,
but he sleeps in another tent.



Who's Fabio?
The metrosexual?



I don't know who Fabio is!



They're all coming. Girls too.



I'm going to miss you.



I値l be missing you.



It's a shame you have
to go so far away to breathe.



I won't go to work tomorrow,
if you're Leaving. I'd better stay.



Fine, so you go
to the kindergarten.



You値l have to talk
to the teacher...



Listen to me, Sandra.



Don't you think Perelman senior
is acting kind of weird?



Weird? Why?



I saw him today, for a short while.



I don't know,
there's something strange.



He's more affectionate...



What's weird is
you forget about things



and you sleep in your suit.



Don't try to distract me
when I want to feel anguished.



It's not funny...
It's not funny.



You Look so cute.



Is Gaston asleep?



Yes, yes.



Let's go to the mats.



You know I don't Like it there.



- Come on.
- No, that's where I work.



Let's go to the mats.



Sandra indulged me,
and let me do it on the mats.



it was great like that.



But then l felt guilty
about maintaining the lie.



Before she leaves,
I値l tell her about my free time.



Hello everybody,
my name is Alejandro,



I'm Valentino's dad,
I'm also a teacher.



I happen to have
a hot dog chariot at home.



I could be in charge
of the food for the event.



You have a hot dog chariot?



I think it's fantastic.



I'm Hugo's father,
my name is German.



I have a degree
in Music Therapy,



and would Like to participate
in the musical side of it.



I have an idea for a theme:
it's an Alpine concept.



I think it'd be great for them.
With Tyrolese tunes.



Excuse me!
I値l take care of the costumes.



What do you think?
I値l take care of it.



Of course! Write it down.



We don't want our kids
to be naked, right?



Now, we値l discuss
the evacuation drill,



which is extremely important.



- You're sad...
- Me?



- Who...?
- This.



Gaston's yogurt and your pizzas.



Sausages,
try not to eat all of them,



the doctor's number,



the baby sitter's,
she's coming on Tuesday.



And how can I reach you?



The whole idea is
that nobody can reach you.



I値l be calling you guys.



Nice idea, pass me the List.



What if something happens?
Nothing is going to happen.



What could possibly happen?



Everything will be OK.



''Swimming with other daddies''.
No, Sandra, no.



Do I have to hold hands
with other hairy men?



I saw them today.
It's hard for me...



What's so hard?
Hairy men?



Have a Look at yourself.
You're as hairy as a carpet.



It's a very nice experience.



I don't get it, Sandra.



We're paying
this Swiss kindergarten



to take care of things for a while,
things we take care of all the time,



so why do we have
to take part in everything?



I'm paying not to take part!



-You're Leaving, Sandra...
- Perelman.



- What?
- Calm down.



Breathe in, get rid of that face.



I know you don't Like
to stay here by yourself.



But this is important to me.



I haven't Left the house
since Gaston was born.



I appreciate
what you're doing for me.



You go to the parents' meeting,



take care of the children痴 show,
You go to the swimming pool.



Then I come back
and take care of the poo.



Hold it. You're in charge
of the whole potty training.



The potty,
how to hold himself,



and sexually until
he's no longer a minor.



We got a deal then, a contract.



You Look beautiful.



Bye, Love.



- I Love you.
- Love you too.



Have a good time.



Bye, mom!



Where's she going?



She's going away,
but she's coming back.



A bit far away,
but she値l be back.



Well, mom is gone.



We're on our own now.



For once.



-Alone is fine.
- What?



- Fine.
- Fine?



Where's grandpa Perelman?



Grandpa is working.



In the other ''otis''?



In the other what?



In the other office?



Yes, in his office.



He has his own office,
and dad has another one.



And why?



What are you doing?
Playing with this?



But it gets all creased!



You think dad likes ironing?



No, dad doesn't Like ironing.



Good morning.



Taking care of the files, right?



Fine.



It's Like a mid-morning break.



La Plata, Palermo, San Isidro.



You start on the losing side
since there's a 10ｰ/o rake,



but it clears my mind,



and I get to know new people.



....have something to drink,
kill some time...



Three minutes to go



You never asked your dad
if he's screwing Norita?



Or what kind
of sentimental bond there is



between him
and his longtime secretary?



There are things
we don't talk about.



Our communication is based
on tacit, implicit agreements.



I think parents and sons
don't need to talk about everything.



Half an hour is for my kids.



To me, that's sacred.
Communication is the key.



Dialogue, Listening to them,
the Play Station, too.



Watching a video...



Five on Vedia,
four on Palito and Monk.



How's Turkita's Kid
coming along?



On the street.



I went out for some air,
the office was a mess.



Yes, he asks for mommy,
all the time...



I can barely hear you.



I値l call you Later,
or you call me.



I Love you,
and take good care,



because you Left
an entire family here.



Very small steps, tiny steps,



that's it and now in circles.
Yes, go on.



What's this?



It's the Ianuzzi case,
I've been after it for a while.



It's perfect for you.



It's going to set a precedent.



And I want your opinion.



What do I have to do with it?



Call Uncle Eduardo,
or another colleague.



What's wrong with sons
working with their fathers?



Look at the Libermans,
the Sousas, the Vergaras.



They're Like ten, twelve Lawyers.



They come to see you.



I'm not interested
in those family ties.



I'm at the rehearsal,
with my son,



and you come
to talk about this.



You know I can't work with you.



You have your style,
and I don't have that style.



Besides, there's something
you're not telling me.



Is something wrong?



Maybe.



But you're a grown-up now.



You have to figure
some things out for yourself.



Please parents,
a round of applause.



Thank you.
OK, Let痴 do it again.



You go away on business



and I take your house,
job and wife.



It won't really happen.
It's just an example.



I'm taking your Life.



I killed you.
From 8 to 25 years of prison?



No.
I can give it back to you.



Taking someone's Life.
Who is ''someone''?



A person?



And what is killing?
Is Letting someone die killing?



Yes...



Yes? Are you sure?



Aguy's drowning,



I don't throw the Life vest to him.
Am I killing him?



No.



And if I push the Life vest
away from him?



Tough one.



I'm sorry, I thought
you weren't coming back.



That's why
I lay down on your bed.



I didn't mean
to get inside the bed



where you sleep with your wife
in intimacy.



I get it. It's perfectly OK.



And the sofa wouldn稚 open.
The handle is very rusty.



Yes, I guess so.



This is for you. Thanks a lot.



But this is a lot.
We agreed on 40 with your wife.



50 is fine.
You can take a cab.



Sure? Thanks.



You have your son's gaze:
crystal clear, just Like his.



That's odd, but it's possible,
I'm his father, after all, so...



Do you want me
to come back tomorrow?



No, everything's fine.



- Thanks for everything.
- Goodbye.



Check your waistband, it's too low.
Or is the underwear too high?



The tractor!



That's the tractor?
How does it go?



That sounds Like a train to me.



- What's that?
- Me!



Who's the good guy
and who's the bad guy?



One has to be good
and the other has to be bad.



Which one is it?
Or are they into solidarity?



You know
what ''solidarity'' means, right?



What happened?



What happened with the T.V.?



You did something?



- No, I didn't do anything.
- Shit...



Shit...



Happy birthday, little Gaston!



Happy birthday,
little Gaston!



No more games with this,



I'm already shattered.



Blow it out.



Norita...
What is it? Are you alright?



No.



Is something wrong with you?



No, no, I'm fine.



What happened, Norita?



Your dad...



the Attorney...



After all, Perelman senior
did have a secret.



Perelman senior is now gone,
without warning.



Actually, he did let me know,
in his own way.



And, already an adult,
l didn't figure it out for myself.



Here's the potty.



- What?
- Here's the potty.



- Now?
-Yes.



Are you sad?



Why? Do I Look sad?



Yes.



No, I'm fine.



- What's wrong?
- Nothing.



Nothing?



I値l go get the potty.



- Go ahead.
- I値l be back.



Hurry up, we値l do it here.



BERNARDO PERELMAN.
Died 7-6-2005.



The Hebraic Association
offers its condolences to his son.



The traders of Galleria
Centenario...



His friends at the Chess Club...



The traders in 9th July
Underground Passage...



Plaza Lavalle newspaper sellers...



Once again.



Bone by bone.



We keep breathing there...



Straight up...



That's it, very good...
and now we relax.



A cold tea?



Fine.



What are you wearing?



The tracksuit...



- From our ''first time''.
- Come, sit here.



I Look good in it, right?



Before it was all Loose,
now you've filled it out.



How do you feel
about your free time?



Fine.



It's weird, but...



It's not easy
to change your routine.



The Last time I had you
as a student, we were still single.



That's true.



Do you want to know a secret?



Yes.



It's a secret that goes way back
to the start of our relationship.



Let's hear it.



Do you remember
the Pilates Lawsuit?



-Yes.
- I wanted to tell you...



The truth is
I didn't win that Lawsuit.



Perelman senior won it.



He did everything for me.



In a cafeteria,
on Little paper napkins.



Now that he's gone,
I just wanted to tell you.



You're not even
a Little surprised?



No.



Your dad
had already told me about it.



- What?
- One day he came for dinner,



you fell asleep and we talked
until three in the morning.



And why didn't you
tell me anything?



Because it was a secret
between you and him, not me.



Didn't you feel you'd been
cheated? Not even a Little?



I wasn't ''exactly'' the guy
you thought I was.



I sort of cheated, a Little bit...



But I didn't fall in Love
with a lawyer who won a Lawsuit.



Then who
did you fall in Love with?



At that time,
when I was studying Law,



I didn't know what to do
with my Life.



Like all Law students.



And I saw
all the ''show'' you put on,



with so much enthusiasm.



So confident, so sure
of what you wanted to be.



That's very attractive... sexy.



What's sexy about a guy
teaching in a university?



And you?
What did you see in me?



Because there were Lots
of students. Why me?



Your ass.



Your ass.



And then I looked
into other things.



After all,
you don't Like hearing the truth.



We make a round
that is a hole round...



we make it tiny...
we do it bigger



and now all together
we are going to sing...



closer, closer, closer...
very far... very far...



We have the mediation
on the case Pujato-Gald.



There's also the hearing
with Mr. Oarminatti



regarding the land in Ohaco.



I told you about that, right?



And the meeting with Escorihuela,
that's settled already.



The release from prison of the guy
from the country club, too.



And there's the Ianuzzi case,
which can't wait any longer,



his daughter Perlita is a minor.



It calls for urgent attention.



And we値l have to cancel
the meeting with Melgarejo,



scheduled for Thursday 17th.



Hello, Norita, how are you?



This is Perelman.



OK, fine.



Will you stay in the office
a bit longer?



So I値l be seeing you
tomorrow then?



Perfect.



I want to apologize
I had to Leave suddenly.



An emergency.



So I値l see you tomorrow, Norita.



Thank you very much.



All crimes were committed
in the past, isn't that right?



And we can only rely
on the traces



Left by the crime in the present.



Traces that can be affected
by the passing of time,



or by their original perception,



or by errors in that perception,



even by false testimony.



Excuse me, excuse me...



On behalf of the class of 1998,
Perelman痴 students that is,



I'd Like to give these flowers
to a person who taught us



....the meaning of a word
seldom found in Argentine Justice:



''ethics''.



Around of applause, please.



Do I Leave now?



Leave them
in the teachers' lounge.



Thank you very much.



This would be a typical case
of false testimony,



an error in perception.



But this only just happened,



it'd be in the most recent past.



What color were the flowers
this man gave me?



Norita.



Well, thanks a lot.
You shouldn't have bothered.



No bother at all.



Here you have the keys.



I've put everything in boxes.



The cleaning lady
is coming tomorrow.



What will you do with...?
Will you rent it out?



No, for the time being,
I値l Leave things as they are.



Tell me, Norita,
have you made any plans yet?



I mean
for the next few months.



The truth is
I'm still trying to figure it out.



I'm telling you because
there's a vacancy here.



Defense Lawyer's assistant.



I happen
to be the Defense Lawyer.



So I guess
I'd Like you to work with me.



What would
the working hours be?



Because I'm getting on a bit.



There are things I can't do.
I'm telling you in advance.



That's the plain truth.



We start at 8:30am
and Leave at 2pm.



From 8:30 to 2:00.



I haven't worked mornings
in so many years...



But I can always
give it a try, right?



- I don't know.
- The truth is, I'd Love to.



Take your time
and think about it.



I don't need
an answer right now.



I think it'd be fun
because I've never done it before.



And the kids?



Behind the stage, sweetheart.



- Yes, but...
- Enjoy it...



Look at Gaston.



What's he saying?



That he's wearing
a suit and a tale, Like you.



You have a suit Like daddy?



Remember when he was a baby?



You were worried 'cause
he didn't Look Like you.



Now, with the suit,
he does Look Like you.



But Let痴 not insist on it.
Better Leave him Like he is now.



He can Look Like his father
whenever he wants... if he wants.



What's the rush?



Why hurry?
