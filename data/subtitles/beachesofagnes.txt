2
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,318
I'm playing the role
of a little old lady,

3
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,190
pleasantly plump and talkative,

4
00:00:19,360 --> 00:00:20,952
telling her life story.

5
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:27,752
And yet it's others I'm interested in,
others I like to film.

6
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,713
Others who intrigue me,
motivate me,

7
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,518
make me ask questions,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,833
disconcert me, fascinate me.

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,238
This time, to talk about myself,
I thought:

10
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:45,790
If we opened people up,
we'd find landscapes.

11
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:50,150
If we opened me up,
we'd find beaches.

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:55,195
Put it there, just beyond the mark.

13
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,588
Just beyond.

14
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,036
Facing the sea.
No, facing the sea.

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,033
Turn it around.

16
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,596
Parallel to the sea.
Closer to me, Céline.

17
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,598
Over here.

18
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,597
Lift it up.

19
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,473
That's the idea.

20
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,395
There. Is it stable?

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,358
The north wind will hold it up.

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,753
I think I'm doing
this scarf thing on purpose.

23
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:35,388
I'm hoping it'll blow over,

24
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,750
and you'll film me like this.

25
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,878
That's how I want the portrait.

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,031
That's my idea.

27
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,636
Film me in old spotty mirrors

28
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:48,192
and behind scarves.

29
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,391
This reminds me of the furniture
in my parents' bedroom

30
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,549
in Brussels.

31
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:58,632
The bed was like this,
and Mom's wardrobe.

32
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,318
But it doesn't make the creaking noise
I liked when she opened it.

33
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:11,432
We had a hand-cranked record player.

34
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:15,036
On Sundays Dad listened
to Tino Rossi and Rina Ketty.

35
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:19,833
On weekdays Mom sometimes listened
to Schubert's "Unfinished Symphony".

36
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,997
That was the only classical music
I heard as a kid.

37
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:25,912
I liked the title.

38
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,951
THE BEACHES OF AGNES

39
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,754
I'm adding some living,
spoken credits

40
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,798
to thank the young people
who carried the mirrors.

41
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,790
Emilien...

42
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:59,635
Nicolas... See the camera?

43
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:02,070
Sarah?

44
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,508
Marjolaine?

45
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,674
Céline?

46
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,951
- Jérôme?
- Yeah, I see it.

47
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,468
Too bad there's no portrait of Alain,
who filmed,

48
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,428
or Didier, my partner.
Didier Rouget, my friend.

49
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,629
There are all these people
willing to enter a reverie,

50
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,349
something imaginary,
I don't even know what it is.

51
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:26,919
And they don't even ask.

52
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,675
I want them moving all the time.

53
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,596
Good.

54
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:47,750
Go that way.

55
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,670
The North Sea and its sand
is the start for me...

56
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:17,880
of what I more or less know of myself.

57
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,520
These Belgian beaches were all I knew.

58
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:25,353
All my childhood vacations.

59
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:28,557
When I hear
Knokke le Zoute, Blankenberg,

60
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,314
Ostende, Mariakerke, Middelkerke,

61
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:33,596
La Panne and Zeebrugge...

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,594
the sounds are music to my ears.

63
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:46,356
I was conceived in the city of Arles,
so they called me Arlette.

64
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,556
I changed my name when I was 18.
I chose Agnès

65
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,757
and had it officially changed.

66
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,478
- Are you nostalgic for your childhood?
- Not at all.

67
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,509
But I like looking at the pictures.

68
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:03,758
There were five of us kids,

69
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,273
but I especially remember
being the youngest of the first three.

70
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:12,553
Then I was the eldest of the last two.

71
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,996
I felt independent in the middle.

72
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,993
Everyone says childhood
is a foundation...

73
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,276
provides a structure, I don't know.

74
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,590
I don't feel a strong link
to my childhood.

75
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,678
It's not a reference
in my thought processes,

76
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:31,116
it's not an inspiration.

77
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,672
Well, I don't know.

78
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,158
I'd love to see a little girl
in this striped bathing suit

79
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,469
and another in the one
with the big straps.

80
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,116
I'll buy this one. How much?

81
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,235
Three handfuls.

82
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,078
I don't know.

83
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,513
I don't know what it means to recreate

84
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,718
a scene like this.

85
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:01,996
Do we relive the moment?

86
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,435
For me it's cinema, it's a game.

87
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:07,556
Did you imagine that 70 years later

88
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,871
you'd do an installation
with flowers and shells?

89
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,429
Must you remind me how old I am?

90
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:24,079
When the installation I made
for Zgougou's tomb was exposed,

91
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,196
long before this return to Belgium,

92
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,510
I realized where it came from.

93
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,429
Imagining oneself as a child
is like running backwards.

94
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,195
Imagining oneself ancient is funny,

95
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,952
like a dirty joke.

96
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,112
I always like bringing in old people,

97
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,272
very old people,
senior citizens and beyond,

98
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,908
like in "7 Rooms, Kitchen and Bath"
or like this.

99
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:06,836
And we also came here
for the casino.

100
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,034
I asked Jane Birkin to be the dealer.

101
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,071
17 black, odd, manque.

102
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,634
And I was the player.

103
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,992
No more bets.

104
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,594
32 red, pair, passe.

105
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,108
<i>Père</i> like father
<i>Manque</i> like loss.

106
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:33,639
Oh my, can you afford to lose so much?

107
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:39,108
I lost my father in this casino.

108
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,032
Eugène-Jean Varda.

109
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,675
He played... he lost...

110
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,195
he fell down... and he died.

111
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,957
- Are you Eugène Varda's daughter?
- Yes, I am.

112
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,912
<i>- I sei Coritu Vienou Varda?</i>
- Yes.

113
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,075
Scene A, take 2

114
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:08,229
<i>- I sei Coritu to Varda, to Vienou?</i>
- Yes.

115
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,990
Are you the daughter...

116
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,989
Are you...

117
00:09:20,520 --> 00:09:23,637
Eugène never spoke of his family.
He forgot he was Greek.

118
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,076
The family tree.

119
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,032
- Jean, the doctor...
- My grandfather.

120
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,516
had Lucien, Georges and Eugène,
your father.

121
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:32,874
Dad had five children:

122
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,315
Hélène, Lucien, me, Jean and Sylvie.

123
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,630
I have a photo of the whole family.
Only one.

124
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,993
Taken in the courtyard
of the Brussels house.

125
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,316
As a kid
I didn't know my father was Greek.

126
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,948
Of Greek ancestry, naturalized.

127
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:50,873
He never offered to take us to Greece.

128
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,039
We were raised as French children
in Brussels.

129
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,997
Some time ago,

130
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,470
I received a letter from a doctor.

131
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,873
It said:

132
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:06,828
I live in your childhood home
and I'm planning to sell.

133
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,831
Would you like to see it again?

134
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,996
So I went to Brussels,

135
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:13,912
Rue de l'Aurore,

136
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,998
with my little camera.

137
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,115
Headed for my childhood home.

138
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:26,159
I said, "Let's start with the garden. "

139
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,076
It was the same, but overgrown.

140
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:34,029
With its brick walls painted white.

141
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,750
I know the shape of the basins by heart.

142
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,558
Especially the pear-shaped one,

143
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,711
and we had a little cement bridge.

144
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,793
The garden is here,
but emotion is absent.

145
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,829
No memories of playing here,
nor of tears.

146
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,358
I know some things,

147
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:51,715
the ones Mom told me about.

148
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:56,276
Here she is in her Sunday finest,
near the bridge.

149
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,950
At the Brussels flea market yesterday,

150
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:02,156
I bought two rusty knives

151
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:05,478
like the ones
Mom sent us outside to clean.

152
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,950
She'd say, "Do it top to bottom. "

153
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,951
I had Yolande Moreau tell it

154
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:13,111
in an imaginary kitchen.

155
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,272
That's life.

156
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,437
When I was little,
in the Ardennes countryside,

157
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,398
Mother would send us out
to clean the knives.

158
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,671
We'd push the blade into the ground,
like this,

159
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:29,752
and rub it from top to bottom.

160
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,838
From the bottom to the top,

161
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,231
I rediscovered things that spoke to me.

162
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,354
At this window, I remember Mom crying
when Queen Astrid died.

163
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,716
She collected photos of Astrid.

164
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,997
With her husband King Léopold III...

165
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,673
Wearing an evening gown...

166
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,717
Dressed for a visit to the poor...

167
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:57,156
Or holding a colonized child
from The Belgian Congo.

168
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,678
Astrid was the Lady Di of the 30s.

169
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,672
She met the same tragic end.

170
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,637
She died in a car accident

171
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,758
at the height of her youth and beauty.

172
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,268
I asked if I could go up to my room

173
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,192
on the second floor.

174
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,910
The girls' bedroom
became their living room,

175
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,479
and our terrace was still there.

176
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,029
I did a lousy job of filming!

177
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,031
You could still see Cambre Abby

178
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,391
and the garden from above.

179
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,395
I wanted to locate
where the three sisters' beds were.

180
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,439
He wanted to show me
his miniature train collection.

181
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,192
I bought only Swiss trains.

182
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:41,599
Can you tell if they're in original
condition or repainted?

183
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,548
Absolutely.
Like a car expert can tell right away

184
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:49,235
if the used car he's buying
is the original color or not.

185
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,153
The most expensive one

186
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:55,676
cost me 15,000 Belgian francs
in the early 1980s.

187
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,754
It's a brass piece.

188
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,748
It's worth 80,000 Belgian francs
in Switzerland today.

189
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:05,593
There were only 150 of them made.

190
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:09,673
- And that one?
- A car from the Orient Express.

191
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:11,672
3,000 francs.

192
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,353
We bought it on the train itself.

193
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,795
You were married recently. When?

194
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,109
Two years ago August.

195
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:20,352
Couldn't he sell a car
and buy you a diamond?

196
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:23,273
Actually, he is starting to sell them.

197
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,279
It's an investment.

198
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,673
The collection is currently worth
2 million Belgian francs.

199
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,353
Two million?

200
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,794
It's a real passion!

201
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,911
We call ourselves "insane for trains".

202
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,675
But the real term for a train buff,

203
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:40,718
whether he's into toy trains
or real trains,

204
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,792
is "trainopath".

205
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,879
Trainopath!

206
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,872
It was an amusing encounter.

207
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:52,996
It was also an unusual one.

208
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:56,955
I was taken in by this couple
and the train collection.

209
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:05,193
The "childhood home" part was a flop.

210
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,390
But the house and I
were separated by the war anyway.

211
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,639
After the war I rarely returned
to the Ixelles ponds

212
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,472
at the end of Rue de l'Aurore.

213
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,798
One time was really nice.

214
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,393
I'm 27 years old,

215
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,235
it's the first screening
of my first film in a giant theatre.

216
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:28,389
It's also my first stay
in a luxury hotel.

217
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,560
I owe these royal pleasures
to Jacques Ledoux,

218
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,188
director of
the Royal Belgian Cinematheque,

219
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,713
who paid the bill.

220
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:41,998
His face is familiar because
Chris Marker cast him in "La Jetée"

221
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,396
as a perverted inventor,

222
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,153
a mad scientist.

223
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,075
We became friends.

224
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,151
We'd talk about films.

225
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,237
We'd go to the flea market.

226
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,109
He'd look for old books
and I'd look for old images,

227
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,953
old photographs of anonymous families.

228
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:03,114
Our own family photos
escaped the flea market

229
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:07,193
as Mom took them
when we left Brussels on May 10, 1940.

230
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,035
In the rumbling
of the bombs and ambulances

231
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,428
we sped off.

232
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,875
Dad at the wheel,
Mom and the 5 kids

233
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,678
tightly packed in the car

234
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,910
on the exodus throughout France

235
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:23,833
alongside people in carriages
and on foot.

236
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:31,838
<i>With my childhood friends the dolphins</i>

237
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,152
<i>Along this shore
Where the sand is so fine</i>

238
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:40,677
<i>On the beach they call La Corniche</i>

239
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,400
The exodus brought us to Sète.

240
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,993
Sète, with its whale-shaped hill,

241
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:50,593
its fishing harbor,

242
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,955
its famous jousters

243
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,599
and its vast beach.

244
00:15:55,560 --> 00:15:57,835
I return to this beach today,

245
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,069
heading backwards,

246
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,754
backwards, like this film.

247
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,593
Now I'm rowing backwards
to the quay where we used to live.

248
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:17,874
Not on the quay, but beside the quay.

249
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:22,032
On a stationary sailboat in the harbor.

250
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,954
Traffic was controlled by the bridges

251
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,432
and we were linked to town

252
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,158
by a water pipe,

253
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,311
an electricity cable

254
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:35,517
and a footbridge facing
the <i>Palais Consulaire.</i>

255
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,115
In school two things were mandatory:

256
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,191
Vichy pinafores,

257
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,072
and singing
for old Marshal Pétain.

258
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:53,870
<i>Marshal, here we stand</i>

259
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:58,193
<i>Before you,
Who saved our Land</i>

260
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:02,114
<i>We, your boys,
We swear to you...</i>

261
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,037
"We, your boys... "
That's right, we sang that.

262
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,919
And we played hopscotch.

263
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,354
Another game, near the boats:
fishing for gobies.

264
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,590
Any bites, girls?

265
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:16,271
Think you're gonna catch a shark?

266
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:19,193
Gobies are no good for eating.
We threw them back.

267
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,037
I remember this quay well.

268
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,031
It was our playground.

269
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,228
There was a little recurring scene.

270
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,436
We paid him no mind,

271
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,991
and Mom, across from the <i>Palais,</i>

272
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,754
was too busy washing six sets of sheets
to notice.

273
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:49,031
She never saw anything.

274
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,354
As soon as we came back home
from school...

275
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,232
well, on the boat,

276
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,277
we had to put on our lifejackets.

277
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,070
We wore them like corsets,

278
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,757
and Mom wore a girdle
called "Scandale".

279
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:07,196
She was worried,
with her husband away,

280
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:09,510
and mourning a brother
lost in the war.

281
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,674
Europe was ablaze and embattled.

282
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:15,718
Sète was still a free zone,
but there was little to eat.

283
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,478
We were piled on the boat.

284
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,790
She adapted,
but knew nothing of boats.

285
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,030
She was no seawoman,
she couldn't swim,

286
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,679
and she fretted.

287
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,194
But we kids had fun during the war.

288
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:32,476
We had such fun on that boat!

289
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,108
Mom was scared we'd fall overboard.

290
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,871
The lifejackets came in handy.

291
00:18:38,040 --> 00:18:40,759
Every other Thursday someone fell in.

292
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,837
I liked to chorus

293
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,956
with a group of girl scouts.

294
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,916
<i>Little nightingale of the woods
Little wild nightingale</i>

295
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,551
We'd go camping in the woods.

296
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,550
The only trips allowed at the time.

297
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,991
We'd go to the Alps,
and I remember

298
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,037
sometimes the group would split up.

299
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,071
As I learned much later,

300
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,040
some den mothers
were escorting to Switzerland

301
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,315
young Jewish girls.

302
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:16,040
I had no idea they were Jewish.

303
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,717
Fifty years later I made a short film

304
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:28,440
about the horrors
inflicted upon the Jews.

305
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,752
And about the people
known as <i>The Righteous,</i>

306
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:36,195
because they saved
thousands of children.

307
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,516
They were farmers,
pastors and priests,

308
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,319
schoolmarms... ordinary people.

309
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:54,876
I exposed their photos,
and anonymous ones,

310
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,352
on the floor, under several screens...

311
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,996
depicting the vile spectacle

312
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,396
of French military police
arresting Jewish children...

313
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:12,433
pushing them
toward the concentration camps.

314
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,913
Saying it, and filming it,
even in fiction,

315
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:22,798
sends chills down the spine.

316
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,032
Time has passed,

317
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:32,272
and passes, except on the beaches,
which are timeless.

318
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,958
On the beach of my teens,

319
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:38,749
I remember not the swimming
but the fishing and fishnets.

320
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,072
The ones on the docks...

321
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:44,798
The ones at the Pointe Courte
where I hung out.

322
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,311
I took pictures

323
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,555
and discovered
that special neighborhood.

324
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:54,751
I listened to people's stories,

325
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:56,999
especially the old folks.

326
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:01,757
I wanted to do something with it,
make a film.

327
00:21:02,200 --> 00:21:04,270
I seemed to be preparing
a documentary,

328
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,079
but part of the film
was about a couple.

329
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,833
Silvia Monfort and Philippe Noiret
(in his first film)

330
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,992
generously participated
in my cinema experiment.

331
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,830
I had in mind a particular structure
for the film.

332
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,514
It would be two films in one,

333
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,398
with alternating chapters,

334
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:25,915
like a Faulkner novel I'd read.

335
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,638
"The Wild Palms."

336
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:30,429
So I'd have a fishermen sequence,

337
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,999
then a couple sequence.

338
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,989
Two stories with nothing in common,

339
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,196
except for a place, the <i>Pointe Courte.</i>

340
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,675
She discovered the place he was born.

341
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:47,480
He showed her the houses, the alleys.

342
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,877
I asked Suzou and Pierre
to stand in for the couple.

343
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,638
With a 16mm camera,
I shot tests with them

344
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,119
as the inhabitants looked on.

345
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:04,195
Before the editing was finished,
Pierrot died of cancer.

346
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,558
Suzou raised their two sons,

347
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:09,876
Blaise

348
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,629
and Vincent.

349
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,828
I invited them to share
in a little ceremony

350
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,831
with a handcart from the film.

351
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,433
A set up to show them

352
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,114
the test footage they'd never seen.

353
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:37,799
They'd seen their father in photos
but never in motion.

354
00:22:48,520 --> 00:22:51,193
A little nocturnal voyage with Pierrot.

355
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:56,476
The kids who were in the film
are the old timers now,

356
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,955
from the neighborhood.

357
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,997
So we hear about it.

358
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,874
I was in the part...
where the little boat arrives

359
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,951
and unloads the shellfish.

360
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,509
The little boy in the boat...

361
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,438
- That was you?
- Yeah.

362
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,352
The little boy grew up.

363
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,072
Take your grapes.

364
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:19,750
And little "Dédé-take-your-grapes"

365
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:23,117
became deputy mayor
when the town council was communist.

366
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:27,034
He was champion
of the Great Jousts twice.

367
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,316
In 1978 and 1987, right?

368
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,313
Yes. Good memory,
you know your classics!

369
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,278
I know my classics,
and I know my friends.

370
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,429
There's Dédé.

371
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,836
Images shot in 2007.

372
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,317
and shot in... 1954.

373
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,233
We'd form a heart.

374
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:11,675
At la Pointe Courte,
the inhabitants surprised me:

375
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,870
They let me into the jousters' world.

376
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,552
And gave my name

377
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,359
to an alley
from the canal to the Etang de Thau.

378
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,830
They even gave me
a little shield my size,

379
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,592
and a matching lance.

380
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,276
This whole mise-en-scene

381
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:47,276
is simply my way
of expressing gratitude

382
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,476
to the Pointuswho adopted me.

383
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,072
Another family adopted me,
the Schlegel family.

384
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,992
I spent my summers with them.

385
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,152
The couple and their three girls

386
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,392
had a balcony overlooking our boat.

387
00:25:03,160 --> 00:25:04,479
Behind these three shutters...

388
00:25:04,800 --> 00:25:06,199
were three sisters.

389
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,395
Andrée became an artist
and married Jean Vilar.

390
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,512
Second-born Suzou

391
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,877
was my den mother
and introduced me to music.

392
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,991
I met Linou, the 3rd daughter,
in 8th grade.

393
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,152
In 10 years together,

394
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:26,029
we traveled, made discoveries
and sowed our wild oats.

395
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:30,513
Together we'd go to the beach
to see a dragnet fisherman.

396
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,793
The Biascamano sons

397
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,077
re-pitched the tent
where their father spent summers.

398
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:39,474
Their sister Patricia
brought the accessories.

399
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,110
The pan Mom made her coffee in.

400
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,960
Agnès is lucky we kept everything!

401
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,872
Even the storm lamp.

402
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,191
Charles, their father,

403
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,635
taught me how to repair fishnets.

404
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:57,431
Remember the fishing then?

405
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,833
So many years ago.

406
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,197
I remember, yes...

407
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,357
but only vaguely.

408
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:08,198
You know, I'm 82 years old.

409
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:11,238
So my memory
escapes me sometimes.

410
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,391
Lovely way of putting it.

411
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:19,598
Her sons Aldo and Fanfan

412
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,796
organized a bit of dragnet fishing.

413
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,992
This time Suzou's son Blaise assists.

414
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,431
On the other side is Christophe Vilar,
Andrée's son.

415
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,830
He lives in Sète, he's a painter.

416
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:35,191
Stéphane Vilar is a musician.

417
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,919
This was his table.

418
00:26:37,080 --> 00:26:39,389
He worked here, facing the sea.

419
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:45,996
Do you realize how much
your sons resemble Vilar?

420
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:47,430
No.

421
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:51,119
She used to tell us that constantly,

422
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,675
a while back.

423
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:56,598
And also a while back,

424
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,990
Andrée began slowly losing her memory.

425
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:01,757
What she does remember

426
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,433
is poetry.

427
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:08,075
I like reciting,
knowing poems by heart.

428
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,549
Jean and Andrée Vilar
named their villa "High Noon",

429
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,552
after Paul Valéry's
"The Cemetery by the Sea".

430
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,309
This roof where dovelike sails
go and come

431
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,310
Peacefully trembles
near each pine and tomb

432
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,433
High noon appeases
with a brilliant flame

433
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:36,948
The sea, the sea,
the sea renewed forever

434
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,794
Any man who gazes at the sea
is a Ulysses

435
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,520
who doesn't always want to go home.

436
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,199
All the children I love,

437
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,511
and all men who gaze at the sea,
I call them Ulysses.

438
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:46,839
As a teenager I'd daydream.

439
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,389
I'd imagine joining a circus.

440
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:53,677
Reality meant little to me,

441
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,070
and I knew absolutely nothing of life.

442
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:58,272
I didn't ask questions.

443
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:00,271
I knew women gave birth

444
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,553
but Mom never told me girls got periods

445
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,796
or what men and women do
when they were naked together.

446
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:22,072
You don't fool around with nets,
they're for fish.

447
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:33,069
This time it's at Sète harbor

448
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,398
that I tirelessly watch the fishermen

449
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,954
in lateen boats with leaning masts

450
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,518
and archaic sails.

451
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,034
Thanks to Mr. Mestre's teachings,

452
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:49,636
Linou and I navigated
with the lateen sail on Thau Salt Lake.

453
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:53,358
"Too much water in the sea!"
her father would say.

454
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:59,038
I'm heading out across Sète

455
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,270
on my own, in a lateen boat

456
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,193
using motor or sail,
depending on the bridges.

457
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,669
<i>Savonnerie Bridge...</i>

458
00:30:08,760 --> 00:30:12,150
Crossing the <i>Cadre Royal,</i>
where the Jousts are held...

459
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:16,152
heading for <i>Civette Bridge...</i>

460
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:35,199
From <i>Victoire Bridge</i>, which turns,

461
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:39,318
to <i>Tivoli Bridge</i>, which rises...

462
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:44,152
And the two bridges where trains pass,
near the <i>Pointe Courte</i>.

463
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:51,557
I named my first film
after this neighborhood.

464
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,471
This is the last shot.

465
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,272
- When do we arrive in Paris?
- Tomorrow morning.

466
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:16,158
We'd say, "Going up to Paris"
as if France were vertical.

467
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:24,394
The whole family, including my father,
gathered in Paris

468
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,631
while the war was still on.

469
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:29,439
Food ration tickets, wooden soles.

470
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:34,035
Paris was full of Germans.
The Occupation, you know.

471
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:38,594
The streets were cold and dark.

472
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,397
The street lights were out.

473
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:48,070
In the houses, we obscured
the windows with blue paper.

474
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,834
At high school, during air raids,

475
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,350
classes continued in the basement.

476
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,394
Mallarmé poems amidst sacks of sand...

477
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:01,632
We were given
two vitamin-enriched biscuits a day.

478
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:12,273
I didn't climb the Eiffel Tower
or Notre Dame,

479
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:16,077
but I did hang out on the riverbank,
near the boats.

480
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,789
I missed Sète harbor and its seagulls.

481
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,674
They rarely discussed the war at home.

482
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,079
People mostly lived day to day.

483
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:32,588
When Paris was liberated,
we were in the country. We missed it.

484
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:37,473
First <i>Baccalauréat</i> final,
braids and white bobby socks.

485
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,675
Second <i>Baccalauréat</i> final,

486
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,910
I started the <i>Ecole du Louvre.</i>

487
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,755
To get there,

488
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:48,230
I took the <i>Pont des Arts,</i>
my favorite bridge.

489
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:53,397
What a pleasure...
though the first year was intense.

490
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,509
Philippe de Champaigne...

491
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,877
and his sister in the convent.

492
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,835
Cézanne...

493
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,198
and his modest mother.

494
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:06,469
Art history books
were in black and white.

495
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:09,438
I'd borrow them
from the Louvre library.

496
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:13,239
I remember reading
on the banks of the Seine,

497
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,958
just below.

498
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,110
Years later I wrote a script,
"Nausicaa".

499
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:23,589
The story of a girl
with a Greek father,

500
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,876
studying Ancient Art at the Louvre.

501
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:28,954
France Dougnac played Agnès

502
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:32,476
and a young Depardieu
played a beatnik.

503
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,675
Give me back my books!
Why'd you take them?

504
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,991
1st answer: No. 2nd answer:
I have no money to buy them.

505
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:52,072
- That's no reason to take them.
- Sure it is.

506
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,312
Need is my motive.
I need art books just like you.

507
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:57,596
Fine, steal.
But not mine, I need them!

508
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:01,116
Young people are all alike.
They crave revolution

509
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:04,272
just to disturb the older generation,
the bourgeoisie.

510
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,352
Steal from the old farts,
not from the youth!

511
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,159
The sacred youth,
bourgeois or otherwise.

512
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,469
I'll have to buy them.

513
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:13,631
That means you have money.

514
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:16,030
You have money,
so I'll take the books.

515
00:34:16,240 --> 00:34:18,629
- I've got books.
- I'm calling right now!

516
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,756
Call the ambulance or the police.

517
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:24,276
But you won't dare. Don't you have
a slight aversion to the police?

518
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,352
Sending a poor man
who needs culture to jail

519
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,750
without books or sunshine...

520
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:31,992
You wouldn't dare.

521
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,629
Peace.

522
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,956
I didn't know many boys.

523
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,635
I was nervous, reserved, insecure,
intimidated by everything.

524
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,995
And I had a problem to solve:

525
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,752
how to enter the world of men,

526
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,954
who frightened me, intimidated me.

527
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,670
I had bad images of men.

528
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:56,556
I had to lose my virginity.

529
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:01,635
I had to find a man
to serve this unique purpose.

530
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:05,193
In reverie,... a delicate stranger.

531
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:08,238
In reality,... a delicate adult.

532
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:14,590
Nothing could beat
surrealist poets and painters,

533
00:35:14,760 --> 00:35:15,795
mad love,

534
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:19,270
and Baudelaire, Rilke,
Prévert and Brassens.

535
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,672
We played with chance.
We played "exquisite corpses".

536
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:32,078
I feel safe in the belly of this whale.

537
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:34,674
Sheltered from the world,

538
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,436
sheltered from the coastal wind,

539
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,910
inside my coastal shelter.

540
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:45,034
Today I'm creating images
which have haunted me for a long time,

541
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,555
since Bachelard's classes
at the Sorbonne.

542
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,795
I didn't always understand
what he said,

543
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:56,794
but when he spoke of the whale
who swallowed Jonas,

544
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:00,953
or Jonas in the whale's belly,
unwilling to come out...

545
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:03,955
I felt involved and happy,

546
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,039
like I do today.

547
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:11,149
It was the age of questions,
not knowing what you wanted,

548
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,598
knowing what you didn't want.

549
00:36:14,480 --> 00:36:16,391
I'd rather eat an apple in my room.

550
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,278
What did you say?

551
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:22,269
I just graduated,
and I've been 18 for three days!

552
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:26,676
Running away, without telling anyone,
seemed necessary.

553
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:29,115
I plotted in secret,

554
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,078
sold several objects

555
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:34,073
and bought a 3rd class train ticket
to Marseille

556
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:37,672
and a deck ticket
for the boat to Corsica.

557
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:42,400
Ah, my first night of freedom!

558
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:43,788
Under the stars,

559
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:47,035
curled up on deck in a coil of rope.

560
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,792
Upon reaching Ajaccio,
I settled in on a quay

561
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,791
with an old fishing net.

562
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,712
As I knew how to mend it,

563
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:01,429
a fisherman needing help
took notice and hired me.

564
00:37:04,720 --> 00:37:06,438
My first job

565
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,751
was to row while they cast
or raised the nets.

566
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,829
But the boat was bigger than this,
and there were 3 of them.

567
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,471
Three months of hard work
and unambiguous cohabitation

568
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,596
with these silent men

569
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,194
made me strong and less fearful.

570
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,959
It was a good start, not a profession.

571
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:30,317
I had to get back to Paris
to learn one.

572
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,358
Ok... photographer!

573
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:35,915
I took night classes in photography

574
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:39,834
at Vaugirard, where Jacques Demy
went 2 years later

575
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,911
to study cinema.

576
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,599
Apprenticeship
with Rodin specialists.

577
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:48,116
I wasn't allowed into the darkroom.

578
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:50,874
My job was to guillotine prints

579
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,993
and retouch them
with gouache and a little spit.

580
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:00,918
They gave me several prints,
which deteriorated.

581
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,912
They're beautiful like this.

582
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:07,152
Like my ceiling,
which I put off repairing.

583
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,636
Training certificate,
first equipment:

584
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,519
a real <i>chambre</i>, as we called them,

585
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,596
and a second hand Rolleiflex
Mother bought

586
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:20,309
from a "Détective" magazine reporter.

587
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:23,429
<i>First paying job at Galeries Lafayette,</i>

588
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,397
400 children per day.

589
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,070
Then a gig with the French Railway.

590
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:32,508
Photos of my friends,
artists and artisans,

591
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:34,636
most of them from Sète.

592
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:38,510
I had photographed
Andrée and Jean Vilar's children

593
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:39,874
on the beach in Sète

594
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,036
and at the <i>Parc Montsouris.</i>

595
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,393
One day he asked me
to the Avignon Festival

596
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:48,393
to lend him a hand
and take some photos.

597
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,879
The previous year, 1947,
I'd missed out.

598
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,678
I'd gone fishing in Corsica.

599
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:59,315
This time I went,
and I was thrilled.

600
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,150
I discovered the Papal Palace...

601
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:17,798
The courtyard
where Vilar built his stages...

602
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,357
This was for Richard ll.

603
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:25,556
There are no more plays
in the orchard.

604
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,833
But I did meet
a wandering musician there.

605
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:32,794
Where are you from?

606
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:35,030
Brazil, Salvador, Bahia.

607
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:43,836
Avignon Festival, 2007
Saint Charles Chapel

608
00:39:45,320 --> 00:39:47,709
Festival directors Vincent and Hortense

609
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:50,275
proposed I expose here
my photographs

610
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:52,311
of the festival's early years.

611
00:39:55,440 --> 00:39:57,556
For those who don't know,
Jean Vilar founded

612
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,159
the Avignon Festival.

613
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,553
He was a great man of the theatre

614
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,917
and a remarkable actor.

615
00:40:08,200 --> 00:40:09,428
In 1948,

616
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,191
when I took this picture

617
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,598
of Vilar after losing his crown,

618
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,953
waving his hand in abandon,

619
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,355
I was really ashamed
that his hand was blurry.

620
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:26,952
Under the tyranny of the sharp image,
I felt my photo

621
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,269
was an utter failure.

622
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,118
Now I like blurry images,
especially in the foreground.

623
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,149
This is Anne and Gérard Philipe.

624
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,949
I'd like us to film Thierry

625
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,350
putting the ancestral tiles back in.

626
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:47,556
This whole idea of fragmentation
appeals to me.

627
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,511
It corresponds so naturally

628
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:52,679
to questions of memory.

629
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,152
Is it possible to reconstitute

630
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,837
this personality,
this person Jean Vilar,

631
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:00,672
who was so exceptional?

632
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,676
This photograph of Gérard Philipe
stands 5 meters high.

633
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:15,396
The puzzle side of things pleases me.

634
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:22,471
There's something of a sleepwalker
in this character.

635
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,433
I asked Gérard to dress as
the Prince of Hamburg in broad daylight.

636
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,715
My idea was to create,

637
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:33,276
with bright sunshine,

638
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,796
the effect of a full moon.

639
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:41,954
As to the flashing cameras at openings,
we know their effect.

640
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:45,076
It's crowded,
everyone's distracted.

641
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:46,872
Noise, speeches.

642
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,074
Always the same.
Compliments, thank yous, waiting.

643
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,718
Emotion is something you can't control.

644
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,310
Of course it's amusing

645
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,914
to see Vilar wearing his sunglasses

646
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:07,479
as a mustache,

647
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,431
rather than normally.

648
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:12,431
He's watching his actors.

649
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,631
But I...

650
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:18,998
Mostly what I see, is they're dead.

651
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,952
So I've brought them roses.

652
00:42:21,800 --> 00:42:23,552
Roses and begonias.

653
00:42:25,560 --> 00:42:27,152
For Casarès, who's gone...

654
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:28,869
Begonias.

655
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:34,079
Begonias for Gérard Philipe, gone.
For Noiret, dead.

656
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:35,639
For Denner, dead.

657
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:38,075
For Germaine Montero, dead.

658
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,116
For Vilar, who I admired so.

659
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:44,915
For this flamboyant young man.
All the girls loved Gérard Philipe.

660
00:42:45,440 --> 00:42:46,509
And he's dead.

661
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:50,759
I cry for them from my heart.

662
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,072
I expose them as an artist

663
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:58,149
who's proud of what she can do,

664
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,514
proud to be invited,

665
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:03,150
and proud when people say,
"What beautiful photos!"

666
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:05,356
"What a beautiful chapel!"

667
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,911
"How young and beautiful
they were!"

668
00:43:10,440 --> 00:43:11,953
Naturally I think of Jacques.

669
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:15,556
All the dead lead me back
to Jacques.

670
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:18,475
Every tear...

671
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:22,756
every flower,
every rose and every begonia,

672
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:24,717
is a flower for Jacques.

673
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,629
He is the most cherished of the dead.

674
00:43:43,480 --> 00:43:46,278
I met him in 1958
at the Tours Festival.

675
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:50,069
In 1959,
Jacques came to live here with me,

676
00:43:50,240 --> 00:43:51,753
in this house

677
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:53,035
and courtyard.

678
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:59,036
This is where we raised
Mathieu and Rosalie.

679
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:02,638
Rosalie became a costume designer

680
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,316
and Mathieu is an actor.

681
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,231
This courtyard, now so charming,

682
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,239
was in a horrendous state

683
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,914
when I first arrived here in 1951.

684
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:18,714
I got the idea to rebuild it as a set.

685
00:44:19,600 --> 00:44:21,238
It was an alley

686
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,439
between an old grocery store
and a framing workshop.

687
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,953
I liked it.

688
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,635
My father came to visit. He said,
"You want to live in this stable?"

689
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:33,712
I said, "Yes, wait and see.

690
00:44:33,880 --> 00:44:35,711
"It'll be nice, later. "

691
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,673
Then my father died

692
00:44:38,840 --> 00:44:41,479
and I moved into this run-down place

693
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,473
with no heat or bathroom, nothing.

694
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,359
Just a Turkish-style toilet
in the courtyard.

695
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:51,191
These were relics
of those who worked here.

696
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:53,793
Frames, even.

697
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,593
Like this one.

698
00:44:57,360 --> 00:44:59,237
I actually picked that one here,

699
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:02,632
and found it beautiful.

700
00:45:03,720 --> 00:45:06,154
Calder was tickled by it.

701
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:09,398
I liked his neighborly visits
to the courtyard.

702
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,438
I took photos of his wonderful mobiles.

703
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:15,548
Calder said he made them in no time.

704
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:18,757
He gave me one
for the time I'd spent for his photos.

705
00:45:18,920 --> 00:45:20,069
What a fellow!

706
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,278
What a wonderful man!

707
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:25,476
So light on the Sète beach,

708
00:45:25,880 --> 00:45:27,108
so joyful.

709
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:31,877
I made a mirror of the frame,
and used it in some films.

710
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:36,032
If you want to look at the spectators,

711
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,589
you have to look into the camera.

712
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:42,395
I look at the camera constantly.

713
00:45:42,560 --> 00:45:44,755
Even when I tell about my urgent work

714
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:47,388
to set up a fully-equipped darkroom...

715
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:50,558
where negatives become images.

716
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:55,678
My early days as a photographer
were difficult. I was on my own.

717
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:57,791
A relatively solitary life,

718
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:00,349
with passing elations,

719
00:46:00,520 --> 00:46:02,795
crushes, love stories...

720
00:46:04,520 --> 00:46:06,636
There were some awfully cold winters.

721
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,116
I had a Godin stove brought in
and coal delivered.

722
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,629
Each day, I'd take my pail

723
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,633
and go pick up the coal.

724
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:29,474
I lived in rabbit-fur lining

725
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:31,710
a wool bonnet and gloves

726
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:33,711
day in and day out.

727
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,276
The cold courtyard

728
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:40,149
served as a set
for Jane Birkin and Laura Betti.

729
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,631
Little A: Patience.

730
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,268
Little B: Courage.

731
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:48,632
The law of the wise unemployed person.

732
00:46:50,360 --> 00:46:53,272
Oh my friend,
how you must've suffered from the cold!

733
00:46:53,440 --> 00:46:54,839
But come,

734
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,270
my boss is looking for an employee.

735
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:01,799
I mentioned you.

736
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:10,914
Our neighbor, the good baker,
accepted our circus on his turf.

737
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:14,159
Your stories sure are funny!

738
00:47:16,880 --> 00:47:19,758
I was a baker
and she was a dressmaker.

739
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:23,396
He was a baker
back home where I'm from.

740
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,838
I'd take bread out to her.

741
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,431
I couldn't wait to see him
on Wednesdays, when he'd come.

742
00:47:33,240 --> 00:47:34,832
I liked his craft.

743
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:37,879
I was happy to become a baker's wife.

744
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,519
And also,

745
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,876
he was quite handsome.

746
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,634
My neighbors were often my models.

747
00:47:47,320 --> 00:47:49,231
The Tunisian grocer

748
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:52,439
and Bienvenida,
who was an amazing woman.

749
00:47:52,840 --> 00:47:54,671
She lived in the same courtyard as me,

750
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:58,389
with her husband and her son Ulysse
who I loved so.

751
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:00,832
I exhibited my work
in the courtyard.

752
00:48:01,360 --> 00:48:03,476
Neighbors came,

753
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,835
and artists like Hartung,

754
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,319
Prassinos,

755
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,479
Brassai...

756
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:12,749
A nude in the shape of a walnut,

757
00:48:12,920 --> 00:48:15,036
and a potato in the shape of a heart.

758
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,077
Just one in 1953,

759
00:48:18,080 --> 00:48:21,231
and hundreds in 2003
for the <i>Patatutopia</i> exhibition

760
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:23,356
at the Venice Art Biennial,

761
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,518
with 700 kilos of real potatoes
on the floor.

762
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:52,559
To attract visitors,

763
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,030
I went around as a talking potato,

764
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:58,630
naming all kinds of potatoes.

765
00:49:04,560 --> 00:49:08,075
When I left,
my costume had a photo for a head...

766
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:11,079
or a cat...

767
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:13,798
or a ceramic tile...

768
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,154
or a mosaic...

769
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,477
like my first official self-portrait.

770
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:23,636
Mosaics and frescoes...
I loved ancient art.

771
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:26,110
The women of Piero della Francesca

772
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:28,471
led me to Silvia Monfort,

773
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:30,119
paired with Philippe Noiret,

774
00:49:30,280 --> 00:49:32,669
who looks a bit like Philippe le Bon.

775
00:49:33,600 --> 00:49:36,797
As for the image of the couple,
I'd seen some Braque.

776
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,308
Back then I also discovered Picasso,

777
00:49:41,480 --> 00:49:43,277
with enthusiasm.

778
00:49:44,800 --> 00:49:47,633
I had to write dialogue for the couple.

779
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,437
Which I did, on Sundays
in my courtyard.

780
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:54,556
If you want peace, I can leave.

781
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:57,798
You talk only of happiness.

782
00:49:57,960 --> 00:49:59,154
That's right.

783
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:01,834
For the editing,

784
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:05,993
Alain Resnais joined the pool
of volunteers in the cooperative.

785
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:08,830
I gaze at his classical features.

786
00:50:09,240 --> 00:50:12,676
They don't reveal his passion
and curiosity for art, culture,

787
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:15,470
and the complexities of surrealism.

788
00:50:16,240 --> 00:50:18,879
He even filmed a missing shot.

789
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,317
My courtyard provided a link shot

790
00:50:21,480 --> 00:50:23,516
for a street in <i>La Pointe Courte</i>.

791
00:50:23,680 --> 00:50:27,468
You'll be telling me once again,
"This can't go on. "

792
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,039
Maybe.

793
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,760
Alain's assistant was Anne Sarraute

794
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:34,799
who introduced me to her mother,
Nathalie Sarraute.

795
00:50:35,480 --> 00:50:38,870
With her Sioux features,
she was the sharpest of writers.

796
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:41,799
She enlightened me,
she influenced my work,

797
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:44,076
and her friendship was a joy.

798
00:50:45,640 --> 00:50:48,279
While we were editing in 1955,

799
00:50:48,440 --> 00:50:50,556
this one fellow often called Resnais:

800
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:51,869
Chris Marker.

801
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:56,275
When he came,
we saw only his leather jacket,

802
00:50:56,440 --> 00:50:59,318
boots, gloves and glasses.

803
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,638
He's so discrete
he has a cat represent him,

804
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,836
a cat named Guillaume in Egypt.

805
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:09,675
He's the author of amazing films
and assorted commentaries.

806
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,797
I'll have to deal with him.

807
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:14,871
He's my friend and interlocutor,

808
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,712
but I changed his voice.

809
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,549
Why did you go
from photography to cinema?

810
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:25,154
I remember wanting words.

811
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:30,151
I thought if you paired images
with words you'd get cinema.

812
00:51:30,320 --> 00:51:33,118
Of course I soon learned
it was something else.

813
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:34,633
Were you a film buff?

814
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:37,155
No, I wasn't a film buff.

815
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:40,835
I'd only seen about 10 films
by the age of 25.

816
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,918
I didn't go to film school
or work as an assistant.

817
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,993
I used my imagination

818
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:49,718
and took the plunge.

819
00:51:50,640 --> 00:51:52,073
I got support

820
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:55,073
and help from generous technicians.

821
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,991
It's not their fault
the film lost money.

822
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:05,276
I continued to work
as a photographer for Vilar.

823
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:10,075
The TNP went from the <i>Papal Palace</i>
to the <i>Chaillot Palace</i>.

824
00:52:10,840 --> 00:52:12,319
Almost daily

825
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:14,790
I'd go up to Trocadero hill.

826
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,313
I needed a car.

827
00:52:16,760 --> 00:52:20,150
I'd park my first <i>4 chevaux</i>
at home.

828
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:22,470
The courtyard and garage
were so narrow

829
00:52:22,680 --> 00:52:24,955
I had to do some tricky maneuvering.

830
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:28,558
Inching forward...

831
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,912
inching backward.

832
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:35,510
I had to do it 14 times

833
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,117
to get into this tiny garage.

834
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:43,475
On a good day
I'd get in there in 13 times.

835
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,198
Take a great leap forward,
go to China!

836
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:54,238
I told them
you were a sinologist

837
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,272
and a good photographer.

838
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,277
I brought the works:
Leica, Rolleiflex,

839
00:52:59,560 --> 00:53:00,754
bellows...

840
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,911
I was loaded up like a mule.

841
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,391
I brought back
thousands of images.

842
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:07,749
I focused on the work

843
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:12,156
and collective impulse
of this brand new revolution.

844
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,197
Sometimes I'd stop
because the landscapes were beautiful.

845
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,109
In China in 1957,

846
00:53:26,600 --> 00:53:29,034
I was amazed
to hear this waltz everywhere.

847
00:53:35,360 --> 00:53:37,032
In the nurseries, to my surprise,

848
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:39,395
the babies wore colorful costumes

849
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:43,110
whereas in France
they were still in baby blue and pink.

850
00:53:47,200 --> 00:53:49,430
I brought back bonnets
that Rosalie wore

851
00:53:49,840 --> 00:53:51,319
a year later.

852
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:54,989
Before she was born,

853
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,915
I wrote letters to her future father
I was in love with.

854
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:04,630
But our love affair ended
when Rosalie was taking shape.

855
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:08,116
I had decorated the envelopes.

856
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:09,713
He sent them all back.

857
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,838
I made a bundle of his,
never reread.

858
00:54:14,400 --> 00:54:15,719
I raised Rosalie alone,

859
00:54:16,320 --> 00:54:17,958
then with Jacques.

860
00:54:23,320 --> 00:54:24,833
We often went to Noirmoutier.

861
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:28,709
Jacques wanted to show me this island
where he camped as a teenager.

862
00:54:31,880 --> 00:54:34,189
He was looking
for a fisherman's house.

863
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,311
We found an abandoned mill.

864
00:54:38,560 --> 00:54:41,154
I was intrigued by a glove
hanging there.

865
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:46,712
The island's specialties
are potatoes and oysters.

866
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:50,752
What a beautiful oyster!

867
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:52,838
What a beautiful mussel!

868
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:54,912
What a beautiful wave...

869
00:54:55,160 --> 00:54:56,354
The New Wave...

870
00:54:56,520 --> 00:54:59,239
Hey! Oyster, mussel, wave!

871
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:01,277
Enough.

872
00:55:01,640 --> 00:55:04,359
Tell us instead about
the birth of the New Wave.

873
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,599
Truffaut, Godard, Resnais,

874
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,070
Chabrol, Rivette, Demy...

875
00:55:11,400 --> 00:55:13,277
And you, La Varda?

876
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:16,990
So, Jean-Luc Godard

877
00:55:17,160 --> 00:55:19,469
went to see Beauregard and said,

878
00:55:19,640 --> 00:55:22,632
"I'll make a film, get you back on top.
It'll be great. "

879
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,153
He was right.

880
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,197
He made "Breathless".

881
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:28,316
It was a big success.

882
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:32,519
The audience loved it.
Georges de Beauregard asked Jean-Luc,

883
00:55:32,680 --> 00:55:34,193
"Got any pals like you,

884
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,635
"who make cheap films
that make money?"

885
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:39,271
Jean-Luc introduced him
to Jacques Demy,

886
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:42,758
who made "Lola" with Anouk Aimée.

887
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,273
So Beauregard
said to Jacques,

888
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,278
"I want a stable of guys like you,
know any?"

889
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:51,273
Jacques said,
"No, but I've got a girl, Agnès Varda. "

890
00:55:51,600 --> 00:55:52,874
Beauregard said to me,

891
00:55:53,040 --> 00:55:56,077
"Do like your pals,
make a cheap little B&W film. "

892
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,192
So I made "Cleo from 5 to 7"

893
00:55:58,360 --> 00:55:59,839
with Corinne Marchand.

894
00:56:04,320 --> 00:56:09,235
<i>All the doors are open</i>

895
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,832
<i>The draft is so cold</i>

896
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:17,276
We had to shoot quickly
and focus on the content.

897
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:19,078
Cleo is afraid she has cancer.

898
00:56:19,480 --> 00:56:21,869
I follow her minute to minute,

899
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,793
in real time, in a real situation.

900
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:30,792
I wanted the film to combine

901
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:33,959
objective time,
as seen on the omnipresent clocks,

902
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,992
and subjective time,

903
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:39,835
as Cleo experiences it during the film.

904
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:46,150
Before and during the shoot,

905
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,597
I had Baldung Grien's paintings
on my mind.

906
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:54,236
Voluptuous beauty and bony death.

907
00:56:55,040 --> 00:56:57,349
Sweet flesh cannot live forever.

908
00:56:59,480 --> 00:57:02,711
Her fear of cancer and death
met another fear,

909
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:05,948
the fear of a soldier
in the Algerian war.

910
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:09,234
That war of colonization
was contested by many.

911
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,834
Others bombed the protest sites.

912
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,870
Still others fought that war.

913
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,478
In the film,
Antoine Bourseiller plays the soldier

914
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:21,758
who, before leaving for Algeria
that very night,

915
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:25,710
experiences a moment
of intense friendship with a tall blond.

916
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,712
The film was selected for Cannes.

917
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,716
Corinne feels like
she's queen for a day.

918
00:57:33,880 --> 00:57:36,030
Nobody knows or recognizes me.

919
00:57:36,200 --> 00:57:37,633
Everything amuses me.

920
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,430
Back then we introduced the film
before the screening.

921
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:44,956
The presenter, Léon Zitrone,
introduced me as

922
00:57:45,120 --> 00:57:47,395
"Agnès Varga".

923
00:57:47,560 --> 00:57:50,996
Probably because of the Varga Girls
at the <i>Casino de Paris</i>.

924
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,477
After the screening,

925
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,313
we posed together
outside the former <i>Palais</i>.

926
00:57:57,200 --> 00:57:59,555
The TNP costume designer
made my dress,

927
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:02,393
plus some circus spangles
at my request.

928
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:06,598
I never imagined "Cléo"
would be invited everywhere,

929
00:58:06,760 --> 00:58:08,273
with or without me,

930
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:11,671
and that I'd travel here and there,
with or without Jacques,

931
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,990
whose films "Lola" and "Bay of Angels"

932
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,878
went to many festivals

933
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:19,032
before the mega-tour
of "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg".

934
00:58:20,760 --> 00:58:23,228
In 1962, a halt in Cuba,

935
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:25,277
in the middle of its revolution.

936
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:34,111
It was Socialism and cha-cha-cha,

937
00:58:34,280 --> 00:58:37,397
with big hopes and energy,
beautiful to witness.

938
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:40,711
I took pictures to film later.

939
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:47,149
I had to photograph Fidel Castro.

940
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,592
When I did,

941
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:53,549
I saw a tall utopist with stone wings.

942
00:58:57,120 --> 00:59:00,112
And I had to photograph
the sugar cane harvest.

943
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:15,312
Radical climate change.

944
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:18,309
In the dead of winter in Noirmoutier,

945
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:22,076
I sorted and prepared
the 4,000 Cuba photos

946
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,477
for my animated film.

947
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:29,029
Jacques and I

948
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:32,909
loved arriving on the island
just after the tides cleared the road.

949
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,229
We loved that island,

950
00:59:34,440 --> 00:59:35,395
living there,

951
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,513
writing there.

952
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:43,076
I feel good by the sea.

953
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,356
Like the sea,
with its changing colors...

954
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:51,434
Maybe I'm a bit like that too,

955
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:52,556
gray and blue.

956
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:58,392
I'd like to make calm films.

957
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,229
Films about happiness.

958
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:06,029
I made a film
about a particular happiness.

959
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:10,235
I filmed it in the delicate landscapes
of the <i>Ile-de-France</i>

960
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,039
that had so impressed
the Impressionists.

961
01:00:17,320 --> 01:00:20,596
It's the simple story,
actually not so simple,

962
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:22,239
of a little family.

963
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:26,079
With Jean-Claude Drouot, his wife

964
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:27,673
and their children.

965
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:33,879
We all know the tender expression
of parents gazing at their children.

966
01:00:34,920 --> 01:00:37,309
Tender is an understatement.

967
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:43,669
Come see.

968
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:45,428
Come see... Hélène.

969
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,228
You know, Jacques took this picture.

970
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:51,754
It's intimidating for me
to film you two.

971
01:00:51,920 --> 01:00:54,718
I'd like to see you always together.

972
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:58,429
My beautiful children,
the children of Jacques and Antoine,

973
01:00:58,600 --> 01:01:01,478
raised by Jacques...
My beautiful children.

974
01:01:03,240 --> 01:01:04,878
Such as we are!

975
01:01:06,320 --> 01:01:08,834
Here's Rosalie,
at the end of "Umbrellas".

976
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:12,196
She's the love child.

977
01:01:12,760 --> 01:01:15,911
I was paid, I got a little umbrella
and grocery store.

978
01:01:16,480 --> 01:01:19,153
Here she is in
"One Sings, The Other Doesn't".

979
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:23,039
- For my 18th birthday.
- You didn't argue.

980
01:01:23,200 --> 01:01:24,553
I had no choice!

981
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,199
I had no choice.

982
01:01:26,360 --> 01:01:28,874
And this one, Mathieu Demy...

983
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,238
I watched him grow up on screen.

984
01:01:38,120 --> 01:01:40,554
Apparently Nazism wasn't much at first.

985
01:01:41,360 --> 01:01:43,510
They only had six members.

986
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:47,673
But this is fiction,
while he's still alive he can serve us.

987
01:01:50,120 --> 01:01:53,032
He amazed me in a pastiche
from "The Golden Age",

988
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:54,713
in homage to Luis Bunuel.

989
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,037
Was that my little Mat?

990
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:10,876
When I shot "Daguerreotypes",

991
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,996
Mathieu Demy was just little.

992
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:16,352
I'd had him late
and wasn't keen on leaving him.

993
01:02:16,520 --> 01:02:19,432
Filming in the neighborhood
suited me.

994
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,431
It kept me close to home.

995
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:25,470
My merchant neighbors
agreed to come to the café

996
01:02:25,640 --> 01:02:26,834
for Mistag's show.

997
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:29,515
They let us shoot in their shops.

998
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,030
I promised to use my own electricity.

999
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:36,079
I'd thread the cord
through the mail slot.

1000
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:37,719
Every morning

1001
01:02:37,880 --> 01:02:39,598
we pulled the cord

1002
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:43,355
to the café, the bakery,

1003
01:02:43,600 --> 01:02:45,318
the accordion seller,

1004
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:47,556
the guy who sold clocks...

1005
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,158
On the other side,

1006
01:02:50,440 --> 01:02:51,714
the tailor,

1007
01:02:51,960 --> 01:02:54,030
the hardware store...
Then further down,

1008
01:02:54,520 --> 01:02:55,999
the butcher,

1009
01:02:56,640 --> 01:02:57,914
the grocer,

1010
01:02:58,560 --> 01:03:00,551
and this couple I loved so much,

1011
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,439
Mr. and Mrs. Chardon Bleu,
at the end.

1012
01:03:05,680 --> 01:03:08,638
I said I'd go no further than 90 meters.

1013
01:03:08,800 --> 01:03:10,438
That was the limit.

1014
01:03:10,600 --> 01:03:13,910
At night we'd pull the cord back

1015
01:03:14,080 --> 01:03:16,799
and put away the lights.

1016
01:03:17,240 --> 01:03:19,549
The cord stayed stuck in the slot,

1017
01:03:20,080 --> 01:03:21,957
and I went home.

1018
01:03:22,360 --> 01:03:23,998
We cut the electricity.

1019
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,918
One time,
I told the story of this long cord,

1020
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,512
90 meters and all...

1021
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,272
And someone said,

1022
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:37,756
"You didn't want to cut
the umbilical cord. "

1023
01:03:38,160 --> 01:03:40,071
They may have been right.

1024
01:03:45,360 --> 01:03:47,749
Our facade
went through transformations.

1025
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:51,792
So did the Belfort Lion,
who reigned over the neighborhood.

1026
01:03:52,160 --> 01:03:54,833
André Breton suggested he chew a bone.

1027
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,593
And I replaced him
with my cat Zgougou.

1028
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:06,999
Zgougou is also the mascot

1029
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,760
and logo of our production company.

1030
01:04:11,320 --> 01:04:12,833
Ciné Tamaris.

1031
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,117
You want to speak to Cecilia Rose?
One moment...

1032
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:20,154
I'm calling about
a rental of "Peau d'Ane".

1033
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:30,199
Hello? Please hold.

1034
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,112
There's no more tea!

1035
01:04:35,960 --> 01:04:37,712
Have you got the estimate?

1036
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:39,797
Not yet, not yet.

1037
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,952
Here are the "Jacquot" reels.

1038
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,314
Thanks.

1039
01:04:51,040 --> 01:04:52,792
I'll put you through...
Agnès?

1040
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:54,430
Me first!

1041
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,115
See Stéphanie.

1042
01:04:57,600 --> 01:04:59,033
Bank Neuflize OBC?

1043
01:05:01,120 --> 01:05:03,998
We need a loan without interest

1044
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,470
to finish this film comfortably.
Please.

1045
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:12,388
It's hard to bear the weight
and expenses of a production.

1046
01:05:14,520 --> 01:05:17,717
You must strike a delicate balance
between imagining a film,

1047
01:05:17,880 --> 01:05:19,711
financing it and paying for it.

1048
01:05:21,360 --> 01:05:23,590
Yes, you must spend,

1049
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,398
but you must also collect.

1050
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:27,950
If not money, then trophies.

1051
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:30,755
In a closet or on the sand,

1052
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:33,480
Demy's prizes and mine stick together.

1053
01:05:33,840 --> 01:05:37,389
The Golden Palm from Cannes
and the Golden Lion from Venice.

1054
01:05:58,080 --> 01:06:00,071
Go on, go!

1055
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:06,319
We had the beach 2 days.

1056
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:07,913
First day: gorgeous.

1057
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:11,470
Second day, bad news:
rain, the sand is wet.

1058
01:06:11,640 --> 01:06:14,074
Good news: we've got birds.

1059
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:37,280
I'm home. The cats are here.

1060
01:06:37,920 --> 01:06:39,751
These two, too.

1061
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,309
An imaginary family
found in the street,

1062
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:45,400
along with a handless clock
and two chairs.

1063
01:06:48,280 --> 01:06:50,236
But for some people,
finding means eating.

1064
01:06:51,480 --> 01:06:53,118
They live on our leftovers.

1065
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:55,470
They go to market when it's over.

1066
01:06:56,040 --> 01:06:58,076
People throw away so much.

1067
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:01,431
They rummage through garbage.

1068
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:05,196
In the past,
they foraged by necessity.

1069
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:07,273
Today that's still true.

1070
01:07:08,680 --> 01:07:10,557
To see so much waste,

1071
01:07:10,720 --> 01:07:14,395
while others are going hungry...

1072
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,198
It's deplorable.

1073
01:07:16,840 --> 01:07:18,034
I was able to approach them,

1074
01:07:18,640 --> 01:07:20,756
and sometimes film them
on my own

1075
01:07:21,200 --> 01:07:23,475
thanks to these new little cameras,

1076
01:07:23,640 --> 01:07:25,358
digital, sound cameras.

1077
01:07:29,360 --> 01:07:32,397
I could even use one hand
to film my other hand

1078
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:39,434
catching trucks during
the long trip North to South

1079
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:41,672
for the "Gleaners" shoot,

1080
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:44,673
and from the seaside
to the center of France.

1081
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:48,837
<i>These are the departements
I memorized as a child</i>

1082
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,231
with the help of puzzles
now relegated to flea markets.

1083
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,514
Gone are the days of,
"Corrèze, county seat Tulle... "

1084
01:07:56,680 --> 01:07:58,636
"Lot, county seat Cahors... "

1085
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:03,515
I like hanging around flea markets.

1086
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:06,513
Hunting around,
chatting, strolling, filming...

1087
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:07,874
and finding stuff.

1088
01:08:11,640 --> 01:08:14,393
Look, a plate from Liège.

1089
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:16,471
I'll give it
to the Dardenne Brothers,

1090
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:18,278
my brothers in cinema.

1091
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:22,994
A sewing machine like the one
in "L'Opéra Mouffe".

1092
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:30,151
And some film cards.

1093
01:08:34,560 --> 01:08:36,152
My favorite film.

1094
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:43,108
Here! Ten cents for my film.

1095
01:08:53,440 --> 01:08:54,759
Jacques Demy...

1096
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:00,799
Jean Cocteau...

1097
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:11,919
Before we were cinema cards
with cardboard heads,

1098
01:09:12,080 --> 01:09:15,117
we were flesh and blood beings.

1099
01:09:15,280 --> 01:09:17,510
Lovers, like Magritte's.

1100
01:09:52,680 --> 01:09:54,796
We shared a bed, a table,

1101
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,633
children, games
and trips to Noirmoutier.

1102
01:09:57,800 --> 01:10:00,519
But the courtyard
afforded us two domains.

1103
01:10:01,040 --> 01:10:02,996
That's what Michèle Manceaux observed.

1104
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:06,232
On one side, Jacques,
here with Michel Legrand...

1105
01:10:06,400 --> 01:10:09,153
Here, cinema is made in every corner.

1106
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:12,118
Across the courtyard
we find Agnès Varda

1107
01:10:12,280 --> 01:10:15,078
with Michel Piccoli,

1108
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,236
finishing her latest film "The Creatures".

1109
01:10:17,400 --> 01:10:20,198
Edgar...
You turn, and immediately...

1110
01:10:21,680 --> 01:10:23,671
as soon as you turn around...

1111
01:10:23,840 --> 01:10:25,671
Ready? Action!

1112
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:27,629
Edgar?

1113
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:32,874
Easier to do a link shot in Paris

1114
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:34,712
than take Piccoli back to Noirmoutier

1115
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:37,550
where the film was shot.

1116
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,998
We'd settled in there, we went often.

1117
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,789
The island inspired me.

1118
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:52,438
In the film,
Michel Piccoli talks to a horse.

1119
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,355
Then to his wife,

1120
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:56,915
Catherine Deneuve, mute

1121
01:10:57,720 --> 01:10:59,312
after an accident.

1122
01:11:03,760 --> 01:11:05,910
She looks like
an Angel of Annunciation

1123
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:08,799
when she announces
they're going to have a child.

1124
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:19,115
Jacques was nearby on the island,
preparing a film with Michel.

1125
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,236
He'd come to the shoot sometimes

1126
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:23,711
and take Polaroid pictures.

1127
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:27,119
But for the other films
we were on our own.

1128
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:30,992
We visited each other's sets
only rarely,

1129
01:11:31,520 --> 01:11:32,999
and discretely.

1130
01:11:36,080 --> 01:11:38,913
I want to point out that Godard,
in friendship,

1131
01:11:39,760 --> 01:11:42,228
let me film him
without his dark glasses.

1132
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:45,832
I loved his beautiful eyes
and his cinema.

1133
01:11:46,720 --> 01:11:48,597
I took a few photos.

1134
01:11:50,160 --> 01:11:53,994
"The Umbrellas of Cherbourg" crew,
like a family.

1135
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,637
And beautiful Catherine
on the Farewell Platform.

1136
01:11:58,800 --> 01:12:01,439
The yellow raincoat
in the background is Jacques.

1137
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:06,519
Here's Jacques Demy
wreathed in his Cannes Golden Palm.

1138
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:09,109
His film was popular
in the USA

1139
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:13,193
and Columbia Pictures
offered him an attractive contract.

1140
01:12:14,280 --> 01:12:16,589
I followed Jacques because I loved him,

1141
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:19,718
and they'd offered him
a wonderful Hollywood adventure.

1142
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:22,072
I didn't expect to stay long.

1143
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:23,639
But in fact,

1144
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:27,037
this town immediately seduced me,

1145
01:12:27,200 --> 01:12:29,270
immediately fascinated me.

1146
01:12:29,880 --> 01:12:33,077
The hippy movement agitated the town
and its people.

1147
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:36,431
Freedom, Peace and Love,
Down with the Vietnam War,

1148
01:12:37,080 --> 01:12:39,514
Up with the Black Panthers,
Women's Lib...

1149
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:44,192
Huge peace rallies were held
in public parks.

1150
01:12:47,200 --> 01:12:50,078
Jacques was looking for a partner
for Anouk Aimée.

1151
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,434
He had me test

1152
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:54,234
a young actor named Harrison Ford.

1153
01:12:54,480 --> 01:12:57,790
But the studios
advised him to forget acting.

1154
01:13:00,200 --> 01:13:02,031
He still laughs about it.

1155
01:13:11,440 --> 01:13:15,877
In 1967-68, I shot "Lions Love"...

1156
01:13:16,040 --> 01:13:18,508
Then we came back,
ten years later,

1157
01:13:18,680 --> 01:13:21,672
and I shot my documentary
"Mur Murs", but...

1158
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:25,192
Thinking about it,
time gets all mixed up.

1159
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:29,040
When we lived in Beverly Hills
with a palm tree,

1160
01:13:29,320 --> 01:13:31,470
and a kidney-shaped pool,

1161
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:34,559
Rosalie discovered TV and commercials.

1162
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:38,072
Ten years later,
Mathieu fell for a pinball machine

1163
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:40,316
in a seaside apartment.

1164
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:47,432
My memories swarm around me
like confused flies.

1165
01:13:47,600 --> 01:13:50,398
I hesitate to remember all that.

1166
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:51,510
I don't want to.

1167
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:55,598
And now I'm returning
to my films' locations.

1168
01:13:56,480 --> 01:13:59,153
I'm not sure I'm happy about it.

1169
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:13,150
The blue-eyed whale
reminded me of Prévert.

1170
01:14:14,120 --> 01:14:16,190
California swimming pools

1171
01:14:16,360 --> 01:14:18,555
reminded me
of my Hollywood hippy film,

1172
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,517
"Lions Love and Lies".

1173
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,234
The two guys were Rado and Ragni,

1174
01:14:39,400 --> 01:14:42,278
authors and actors
of the famous musical "Hair".

1175
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:45,274
And the divine Viva,
Andy Warhol's muse,

1176
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:48,678
who I'd met
at the Factory in New York.

1177
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:52,636
Here they are in a conjugal threesome,

1178
01:14:54,200 --> 01:14:56,839
watching the news of an assassination.

1179
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:09,759
The slogan of the time in action:
Sex and Politics,

1180
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:11,194
Politics and Sex.

1181
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:19,476
As for Emilie's desk,

1182
01:15:19,640 --> 01:15:22,950
it faced my favorite landscape,
the beach.

1183
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,155
Sometimes we put the camera there,

1184
01:15:30,320 --> 01:15:32,754
turned it on and waited.

1185
01:15:35,080 --> 01:15:38,959
Passersby staged their own scenes,
invested the space.

1186
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,433
Chance was my assistant
for this film called "Documenteur".

1187
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,596
Another day while shooting,

1188
01:15:46,760 --> 01:15:49,513
chance offered us
a nasty lovers' quarrel.

1189
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:51,672
We were alerted by angry voices.

1190
01:15:51,840 --> 01:15:53,273
I panned the camera.

1191
01:16:29,640 --> 01:16:31,835
I asked if the camera bothered them.

1192
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:33,069
They couldn't care less.

1193
01:16:33,240 --> 01:16:35,879
So I sent in Sabine to walk past them.

1194
01:16:40,400 --> 01:16:43,233
How to describe Sabine Mamou?
Her grave beauty...

1195
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,080
And her laugh,
that we'll never hear again.

1196
01:16:46,600 --> 01:16:49,876
She was a film editor.
She agreed to play Mathieu's mom.

1197
01:16:50,040 --> 01:16:51,439
A mother and her son.

1198
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:53,677
Emilie and Martin.

1199
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,753
In retrospect,

1200
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:59,195
I see she was another me.

1201
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:02,869
<i>- How's Martin?</i>
- He's well.

1202
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:03,836
<i>And Tom?</i>

1203
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:05,914
We're separated.

1204
01:17:07,000 --> 01:17:09,878
<i>I don't believe it, not you two!</i>

1205
01:17:10,040 --> 01:17:11,996
<i>You got along so well.</i>

1206
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,719
<i>Tell me, are you alright?</i>

1207
01:17:15,880 --> 01:17:16,869
No.

1208
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:32,628
If I'm not happy, what'll we do?

1209
01:17:35,000 --> 01:17:38,117
If he's not happy, what'll I do?

1210
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:41,633
If they're not happy,
what do they do?

1211
01:17:42,040 --> 01:17:44,110
Women or men, what do they do?

1212
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:49,910
This pier on the Pacific Ocean

1213
01:17:50,080 --> 01:17:52,913
is the end of the line
for the westward rush.

1214
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:57,713
For many immigrants
with dreams of success,

1215
01:17:57,880 --> 01:17:59,393
it's the end of hope.

1216
01:18:00,920 --> 01:18:02,114
But it's also

1217
01:18:02,280 --> 01:18:04,953
a favorite spot
for Venice Beach eccentrics.

1218
01:18:19,240 --> 01:18:22,277
On this beach I like seeing friends
from all times.

1219
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:26,318
Tracy and Jimmy MacBride,

1220
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:29,870
the independent filmmaker
I met in 1968.

1221
01:18:30,880 --> 01:18:33,235
May '68 in France...

1222
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,516
ring any bells?

1223
01:18:35,680 --> 01:18:37,830
I wasn't there, that's all.

1224
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:40,914
But in '68, the Black Panthers

1225
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,519
were organizing.

1226
01:18:43,360 --> 01:18:44,759
And I filmed them.

1227
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:51,791
They protested, and I filmed.

1228
01:18:52,440 --> 01:18:55,910
And I marched
with Vietnam War protestors.

1229
01:19:08,520 --> 01:19:10,670
No draft, but there are deaths.

1230
01:19:11,240 --> 01:19:13,390
An homage on the beach.

1231
01:19:16,600 --> 01:19:19,831
In this gallery,
artists have designed posters.

1232
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,151
30,000 of them
have already been distributed,

1233
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:26,830
but the artists don't know
what effect this action has.

1234
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:31,434
I came across our friend Gerry Ayres.

1235
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:35,070
He's the one who brought Jacques
to Columbia in 1967

1236
01:19:35,240 --> 01:19:36,958
and gave him <i>carte blanche</i>.

1237
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:40,669
He also followed my adventures
with the Hollywood studios.

1238
01:20:00,440 --> 01:20:02,078
Forget the studios.

1239
01:20:02,240 --> 01:20:06,711
I used French money to make
my film about murals, "Mur Murs".

1240
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:12,075
This one was an ad
for a wedding dress shop.

1241
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:19,229
This long fresco painted
on six kilometers of wall

1242
01:20:19,400 --> 01:20:21,277
is called "Pigs' Paradise"

1243
01:20:25,640 --> 01:20:28,552
and surrounds a sausage factory.

1244
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:32,193
They kill 6,000 pigs per day here.

1245
01:20:38,840 --> 01:20:42,310
Other murals express problems
on a local level:

1246
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:45,151
alcohol, battered women...

1247
01:20:47,120 --> 01:20:49,031
poverty, drugs...

1248
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,751
and the demands of certain groups.

1249
01:20:57,520 --> 01:20:59,988
But here a guy painted his wife

1250
01:21:00,800 --> 01:21:02,791
for the surfers to enjoy.

1251
01:21:10,120 --> 01:21:12,076
I'm back at the beach with friends.

1252
01:21:13,480 --> 01:21:17,189
I'd like to make a short film
about each of them.

1253
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:18,469
Lisa,

1254
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:19,909
Gwen,

1255
01:21:20,280 --> 01:21:21,156
Tom,

1256
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:22,555
Lynn

1257
01:21:24,560 --> 01:21:26,437
and Alain.

1258
01:21:27,240 --> 01:21:30,949
Our friend Alain Ronay
introduced us to Jim Morrison.

1259
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,872
We'd go see Jim in concert.

1260
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:34,678
He came to the house
a few times.

1261
01:21:35,320 --> 01:21:37,151
A short digression, in France:

1262
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:40,471
I once took Alain and Jim
to Chambord

1263
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:43,471
to see Jacques, shooting

1264
01:21:43,640 --> 01:21:45,392
his fairytale "Peau d'Ane".

1265
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:51,997
With his favorite princess,
Catherine Deneuve.

1266
01:21:52,840 --> 01:21:55,593
They came as film buffs, as friends.

1267
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,797
End of digression.

1268
01:21:58,280 --> 01:21:59,599
Another digression:

1269
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:01,991
a California brunch for two,

1270
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,310
sharing the camera.

1271
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:14,431
Thank you.

1272
01:22:18,040 --> 01:22:20,395
I forgot I was being filmed

1273
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:25,398
and was caught cleaning myself
less gracefully than a cat.

1274
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:30,549
End of digression.

1275
01:22:32,320 --> 01:22:35,517
I'd like to tell a little beach
love story,

1276
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:39,077
the story
of Patricia Knop and Zalman King.

1277
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:49,030
Patricia knows the names
of birds and angels.

1278
01:23:51,440 --> 01:23:54,352
They protect her and her family.

1279
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:08,273
For so long now, I've watched them live
in loving harmony.

1280
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:12,155
A wave of tenderness for this couple.

1281
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:16,070
A little twinge of jealousy.

1282
01:24:18,560 --> 01:24:19,834
I feel blue.

1283
01:24:55,440 --> 01:24:57,635
Back to France, the house

1284
01:24:57,800 --> 01:24:59,711
and the tree in the courtyard.

1285
01:25:03,760 --> 01:25:04,875
Jacques and I

1286
01:25:05,040 --> 01:25:09,033
were working on less gentle films
than we'd made previously.

1287
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:13,792
Sandrine Bonnaire
was Mona the "Vagabond",

1288
01:25:13,960 --> 01:25:15,951
a beautiful rebel without a cause.

1289
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:26,356
The film is a portrait
of an enigmatic young woman,

1290
01:25:26,920 --> 01:25:29,480
drawn by those who crossed her path.

1291
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,270
We get glimpses of her.

1292
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:35,953
Her encounters
are separated by 13 tracking shots

1293
01:25:36,120 --> 01:25:38,190
all moving right to left...

1294
01:25:40,920 --> 01:25:43,673
all with music
by Joanna Bruzdowicz,

1295
01:25:43,840 --> 01:25:45,956
specially composed for these shots.

1296
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:50,593
Can you take me?

1297
01:25:50,760 --> 01:25:52,432
I'll get my bag.

1298
01:25:54,080 --> 01:25:55,399
Mona is rebellious.

1299
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:56,675
Assholes!

1300
01:25:56,840 --> 01:25:58,956
Mona wants to be free.

1301
01:25:59,280 --> 01:26:02,716
Fuck being a secretary.
I left those petty bosses behind,

1302
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,075
I don't need another one out here.

1303
01:26:09,000 --> 01:26:10,479
I'm not sure when I realized

1304
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:13,632
that it wasn't just a question
of freedom.

1305
01:26:14,280 --> 01:26:17,477
The feminist struggle
had to be collective to exist.

1306
01:26:18,520 --> 01:26:20,795
<i>Down with violence against women</i>

1307
01:26:21,000 --> 01:26:22,752
<i>Male chauvinism kills</i>

1308
01:26:23,880 --> 01:26:26,678
Among the claims,
the most urgent was

1309
01:26:26,840 --> 01:26:29,798
the right to choose
to bear children or not.

1310
01:26:30,160 --> 01:26:33,436
<i>No daddy no pope no king</i>

1311
01:26:33,840 --> 01:26:37,037
<i>No judge no doctor no legislator</i>

1312
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:39,715
<i>Gonna make that choice for me</i>

1313
01:26:40,280 --> 01:26:42,669
I tried to be a joyful feminist,

1314
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,512
but I was very angry.

1315
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:49,311
Rape, domestic violence,
clitoral excisions...

1316
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,630
Abortions in appalling conditions...

1317
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:56,753
Young girls going to hospital
for scraping

1318
01:26:57,200 --> 01:26:58,679
and young interns saying,

1319
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:01,479
"No anesthetic, that'll teach you!"

1320
01:27:04,640 --> 01:27:06,551
Twice we loaned out

1321
01:27:06,960 --> 01:27:09,110
this charming pink house

1322
01:27:10,400 --> 01:27:12,675
for clandestine abortions.

1323
01:27:15,320 --> 01:27:17,709
I was among the women
who signed a manifesto.

1324
01:27:17,880 --> 01:27:21,190
One newspaper dubbed it
"The Manifesto of the 343 Bitches"

1325
01:27:21,360 --> 01:27:22,315
because we'd declared:

1326
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:25,040
We've had abortions! Judge us!

1327
01:27:25,640 --> 01:27:28,837
It was true or false,
but the more or less famous signers

1328
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:32,788
made noise whenever
a woman who'd aborted was judged.

1329
01:27:32,960 --> 01:27:36,714
Same struggles all over:
Women's rights! Workers' rights!

1330
01:27:38,000 --> 01:27:40,992
For his part, Jacques Demy,
along with Michel Colombier,

1331
01:27:41,680 --> 01:27:45,275
came up with a way to tell the story
of a huge strike in Nantes.

1332
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:48,479
The film is called "A Room in Town".

1333
01:27:49,280 --> 01:27:51,794
<i>We don't want any trouble</i>

1334
01:27:51,960 --> 01:27:55,873
<i>Let us through! We won't leave!</i>

1335
01:27:56,040 --> 01:27:59,999
<i>Let us come through</i>

1336
01:28:00,160 --> 01:28:03,948
<i>We're here to fight for our rights</i>

1337
01:28:04,120 --> 01:28:04,836
You have no right.

1338
01:28:05,000 --> 01:28:06,399
That's a movie.

1339
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:09,393
But Delphine Seyrig and I
really did march

1340
01:28:09,560 --> 01:28:11,551
at the Bobigny trial in 1972

1341
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:13,312
for abortion rights.

1342
01:28:13,760 --> 01:28:15,716
And I was pregnant up to my eyes!

1343
01:28:15,880 --> 01:28:19,714
They pushed us against the barriers,
and we laughed and shouted.

1344
01:28:21,080 --> 01:28:23,719
When she was young
Delphine looked English

1345
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,632
and we became friends.

1346
01:28:26,080 --> 01:28:27,752
I photographed her in my courtyard,

1347
01:28:28,360 --> 01:28:29,759
like other actors.

1348
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:33,556
And again later, in the courtyard.

1349
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:35,439
I loved how the feminist

1350
01:28:35,600 --> 01:28:37,272
turned into a fairy.

1351
01:28:40,160 --> 01:28:43,118
Magic wands
aren't always where you expect them.

1352
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:51,754
A wave of the wand
and presto!

1353
01:28:51,920 --> 01:28:53,478
Joan of Ark.

1354
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:00,994
Jane also wanted a shot at the role.

1355
01:29:04,480 --> 01:29:06,835
With my accent, it's impossible.

1356
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:10,390
Imagine, "I shall boot
the English out of France!"

1357
01:29:10,560 --> 01:29:12,232
It doesn't work.

1358
01:29:27,840 --> 01:29:28,716
I've said it before,

1359
01:29:29,640 --> 01:29:32,598
memories are like flies
swarming through the air...

1360
01:29:32,760 --> 01:29:34,990
bits of memory, jumbled up.

1361
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:37,830
Do you think you'll manage?

1362
01:29:38,000 --> 01:29:39,877
We're shooting in bits and pieces.

1363
01:29:40,320 --> 01:29:44,279
It's like doing a puzzle.
You place the pieces here and there

1364
01:29:44,440 --> 01:29:47,876
until it comes together,
but there's a hole in the center.

1365
01:29:48,040 --> 01:29:51,157
It happens at dinner parties,
suddenly it goes quiet

1366
01:29:51,320 --> 01:29:53,914
and someone says,
"Sing us a song!"

1367
01:29:54,520 --> 01:29:56,670
A song? Gainsbourg...

1368
01:29:57,760 --> 01:30:00,638
<i>If I hesitate so often</i>

1369
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:04,953
<i>between the Me and the I...</i>

1370
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:09,759
<i>If I swing between feeling</i>

1371
01:30:10,080 --> 01:30:11,877
<i>And playing...</i>

1372
01:30:12,600 --> 01:30:14,989
A bit of I, a bit of Me...

1373
01:30:15,800 --> 01:30:18,837
I dump it all out,
then tidy up a little.

1374
01:30:19,440 --> 01:30:23,319
Even when we dump it all out,
we reveal little.

1375
01:30:25,200 --> 01:30:26,349
The Eiffel Tower by day,

1376
01:30:26,560 --> 01:30:28,232
the Eiffel Tower by night.

1377
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:33,759
I created an ephemeral monument
to the glory of cinema.

1378
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:35,549
Dziga Vertov

1379
01:30:35,960 --> 01:30:38,599
An eye, a camera, a gaze.

1380
01:30:38,960 --> 01:30:39,870
Action!

1381
01:30:40,040 --> 01:30:43,350
And here's Mr. Cinema,
100 years old and glorious.

1382
01:30:45,320 --> 01:30:47,151
I'm the golden age!

1383
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:49,437
An old man with a fading memory.

1384
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:52,520
That was Mom's problem,
and her freedom.

1385
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:55,270
She got mixed up,
her memory failed her.

1386
01:30:55,640 --> 01:30:58,791
She mixed up the names of her children
and her siblings.

1387
01:30:59,960 --> 01:31:01,791
But who would correct her?

1388
01:31:02,360 --> 01:31:03,873
She had a right to ramble.

1389
01:31:04,200 --> 01:31:05,838
I found it charming,

1390
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:07,519
even funny.

1391
01:31:08,040 --> 01:31:10,110
I am David O'Selznick!

1392
01:31:10,280 --> 01:31:11,759
The other day you were Hitchcock.

1393
01:31:11,920 --> 01:31:14,036
I'm Jean Renoir, Nosferatu,
Catherine Deneuve,

1394
01:31:14,200 --> 01:31:17,033
and... David O'Selznick.

1395
01:31:17,440 --> 01:31:19,078
I created

1396
01:31:19,760 --> 01:31:22,911
three or four dreamy creatures
who are now huge stars.

1397
01:31:24,080 --> 01:31:26,116
My head is full of stars,

1398
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:28,197
faces, beauties!

1399
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:38,953
It's a dream.

1400
01:31:41,040 --> 01:31:43,838
It was a dream to have the means
and a wonderful crew

1401
01:31:44,000 --> 01:31:46,275
to film such impressive stars.

1402
01:31:46,440 --> 01:31:48,396
But for some reason

1403
01:31:48,560 --> 01:31:50,232
maybe it was my fault -

1404
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:53,150
the film took a dunk!

1405
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:59,790
As for the famous Mr. Cinema,

1406
01:32:00,840 --> 01:32:04,515
he was also a little old man,
all alone at night

1407
01:32:04,680 --> 01:32:06,910
hoping someone would pay him a visit.

1408
01:32:13,400 --> 01:32:16,073
It feels better to grow old together.

1409
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:19,950
That was our plan,
even more so when we got back together.

1410
01:32:20,120 --> 01:32:22,680
It was sweet and surprising.

1411
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:25,273
We traveled together,

1412
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:27,636
we lingered in a painting.

1413
01:32:29,360 --> 01:32:31,715
We went to beaches and museums.

1414
01:32:33,800 --> 01:32:35,711
We hung around with Bill Viola

1415
01:32:36,120 --> 01:32:37,314
and Rauschenberg.

1416
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,516
We were close to Jacques Monory...

1417
01:32:43,520 --> 01:32:46,080
And we lived with Prassinos' cat.

1418
01:32:48,120 --> 01:32:50,031
We looked. Together.

1419
01:32:50,680 --> 01:32:52,159
And boom!

1420
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:56,430
Jacques fell ill. A fatal disease.

1421
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:19,511
He was sick. He stayed home a lot.

1422
01:33:20,640 --> 01:33:23,757
Go on now, let me write.

1423
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:28,032
He wrote about his childhood
in the garage in Nantes,

1424
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:30,835
where he lived with his family.

1425
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:34,398
He had me read the pages at night.
One day I said,

1426
01:33:34,560 --> 01:33:36,755
"This would make a great film. "

1427
01:33:36,960 --> 01:33:39,918
He said, "I don't have the strength.
You do it. "

1428
01:33:40,720 --> 01:33:44,872
I said, "Would it please you if I made
this film about your childhood?"

1429
01:33:45,040 --> 01:33:46,837
He said, "Yes, do it. "

1430
01:33:48,880 --> 01:33:51,917
We knew Jacques
didn't have much time left.

1431
01:33:52,080 --> 01:33:54,674
Rosalie, Mathieu and I
were by his side.

1432
01:33:54,840 --> 01:33:59,038
Rosalie and I cared for him in turns,
especially when production started.

1433
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:02,388
Cine-Tamaris had to quickly

1434
01:34:02,560 --> 01:34:05,279
raise money and assemble a crew.

1435
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:08,952
I remember that crew,
so motivated by the film,

1436
01:34:09,120 --> 01:34:11,918
so generous, and sensitive toward me.

1437
01:34:12,480 --> 01:34:15,916
Especially Marie Jo,
who was close to Jacques and me.

1438
01:34:16,800 --> 01:34:18,756
I met with some of them recently

1439
01:34:19,240 --> 01:34:21,515
and we spoke
about those special times

1440
01:34:21,680 --> 01:34:23,636
with Didier and Mireille.

1441
01:34:25,120 --> 01:34:28,078
Jacques was dying,
he knew he was dying.

1442
01:34:28,240 --> 01:34:30,754
He knew AIDS was incurable,

1443
01:34:30,920 --> 01:34:33,912
he knew it could only get worse.

1444
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:35,832
We all knew it.

1445
01:34:36,280 --> 01:34:37,713
Nobody talked about it.

1446
01:34:37,880 --> 01:34:42,158
It was a kind of affectionate silence,

1447
01:34:42,680 --> 01:34:47,117
totally respectful of Jacques,
who didn't talk about it.

1448
01:34:48,000 --> 01:34:51,675
We accepted this silence
because it was Jacques' silence.

1449
01:34:51,840 --> 01:34:55,150
It was his choice to remain silent,
and so we did.

1450
01:34:55,320 --> 01:34:56,230
Back then,

1451
01:34:56,440 --> 01:34:58,078
in 1989,

1452
01:34:58,240 --> 01:35:02,074
AIDS was considered a shameful disease.

1453
01:35:02,240 --> 01:35:03,593
It was taboo.

1454
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,955
His illness was part of the project.

1455
01:35:06,960 --> 01:35:09,952
We were working
as much for him as for you.

1456
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:11,509
For all of us.

1457
01:35:11,720 --> 01:35:13,915
He was somebody, Jacques Demy!

1458
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:15,957
We had this idea that we were...

1459
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:18,439
accompanying Jacques

1460
01:35:18,760 --> 01:35:21,274
as long as we could
by shooting the film.

1461
01:35:25,400 --> 01:35:28,153
I didn't know how he viewed
the reenactments,

1462
01:35:30,000 --> 01:35:32,798
how we reinvented
what he'd experienced or said.

1463
01:35:33,640 --> 01:35:36,598
Sometimes he'd come
with his brother and sister.

1464
01:35:37,320 --> 01:35:38,673
His mother came, too.

1465
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:40,509
You'll draw a crowd!

1466
01:35:41,240 --> 01:35:45,597
I was a bit nervous he'd intervene,
or say, "It wasn't like that... "

1467
01:35:46,800 --> 01:35:48,392
I approached him.

1468
01:35:48,960 --> 01:35:50,791
"How is it? Not too different?

1469
01:35:50,960 --> 01:35:54,032
"Can you see yourself in it?
You as a child?"

1470
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:57,597
And he said,
"Oh yes, it's just right, I'm there!"

1471
01:35:58,320 --> 01:36:02,632
His words encouraged me to continue,
and structure the film.

1472
01:36:03,240 --> 01:36:06,038
There were several films.
One in black and white.

1473
01:36:06,200 --> 01:36:08,760
An homage to the films
of the 30s and 40s,

1474
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:12,071
telling Jacques' story
from the age of 9 to 19.

1475
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:15,512
We shot as simply as possible.

1476
01:36:16,840 --> 01:36:20,719
Then there was a proposition.
It could've been a Master's thesis.

1477
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:23,720
If we explore Jacquot's life,
will we find

1478
01:36:23,880 --> 01:36:26,269
scenes which became scenes
in his films?

1479
01:36:26,440 --> 01:36:29,432
And if so,
a scene from Jacquot of Nantes...

1480
01:36:29,600 --> 01:36:32,319
The engine still rattles at first
but it's normal.

1481
01:36:32,480 --> 01:36:33,595
Thanks.

1482
01:36:34,320 --> 01:36:36,276
...became a scene
in one of Jacques' films.

1483
01:36:36,880 --> 01:36:40,156
The engine still rattles at first
but it's normal.

1484
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:42,955
Or vice versa.

1485
01:36:43,160 --> 01:36:45,355
I'd take a scene from one of his films

1486
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:48,080
and write the script in such a way

1487
01:36:48,240 --> 01:36:50,117
as to present it naturally.

1488
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:51,395
It's almost good.

1489
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:55,234
There was another film.

1490
01:36:55,400 --> 01:36:57,470
Jacques was still alive.

1491
01:36:57,680 --> 01:37:00,558
In this difficult time,
this hard road he was on,

1492
01:37:01,000 --> 01:37:03,389
all I could do was stay by his side,

1493
01:37:03,560 --> 01:37:05,312
be as close to him as possible.

1494
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:11,037
As a filmmaker,
my only option was to film him

1495
01:37:11,200 --> 01:37:14,237
in extreme close-up:
his skin, his eye,

1496
01:37:14,400 --> 01:37:16,277
his hair like a landscape,

1497
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:18,317
his hands, his spots.

1498
01:37:18,480 --> 01:37:21,756
I needed to do this,
take these images of him,

1499
01:37:21,920 --> 01:37:23,876
of his very matter.

1500
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:27,112
Jacques dying, but Jacques still alive.

1501
01:37:29,240 --> 01:37:31,913
The shoot finished on October 17...

1502
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:36,868
and Jacques died on October 27, 1990.

1503
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:19,111
These women are all widows
from Noirmoutier.

1504
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:22,439
I filmed them
and presented them in this way

1505
01:38:22,600 --> 01:38:25,831
so we could choose to listen
to one or another,

1506
01:38:26,480 --> 01:38:29,278
person to person, confidentially.

1507
01:38:29,760 --> 01:38:33,230
Thierry's presence
still fills the house.

1508
01:38:33,400 --> 01:38:35,436
His odor, his...

1509
01:38:35,600 --> 01:38:39,798
Two days ago we ate green beans
he'd bought at the market.

1510
01:38:40,800 --> 01:38:42,756
It's still so new...

1511
01:38:50,240 --> 01:38:52,356
He was quite the man, he was!

1512
01:38:53,240 --> 01:38:55,151
Never a word.

1513
01:38:57,640 --> 01:39:01,872
He came in from the sea
after a drink,

1514
01:39:02,040 --> 01:39:04,679
he went to bed, he slept.
That was it.

1515
01:39:08,200 --> 01:39:10,634
I'm part of the show
and keep silent.

1516
01:39:14,080 --> 01:39:16,116
My exhibition at the Cartier Foundation

1517
01:39:16,280 --> 01:39:18,316
was thanks to Hervé Chandez.

1518
01:39:18,480 --> 01:39:21,790
He had no idea how happy he made me
by inviting me.

1519
01:39:22,400 --> 01:39:26,075
The old filmmaker
turned into a young artist.

1520
01:39:26,400 --> 01:39:29,358
Presenting widows
- the heart in winter -

1521
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:32,799
but also the plastic colors of summer.

1522
01:39:58,400 --> 01:40:00,436
I was almost 80 years old.

1523
01:40:00,600 --> 01:40:04,832
In French slang "broom" means "year".
I'd be 80 brooms!

1524
01:40:05,560 --> 01:40:08,757
I was surrounded by
young technicians and friends.

1525
01:40:09,800 --> 01:40:12,519
This is an homage to Sempé.

1526
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,116
I FEEL PAIN EVERYWHERE

1527
01:40:16,560 --> 01:40:20,678
I'm fortunate to be helped in my work
by Rosalie and by Christophe Vallaux.

1528
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:23,199
He's a scenographer.

1529
01:40:23,360 --> 01:40:25,510
He's well known for his fashion sense

1530
01:40:25,680 --> 01:40:27,272
and his caricatures.

1531
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:31,039
In Noirmoutier we spotted some shacks

1532
01:40:31,200 --> 01:40:33,350
for him to build for the exhibit.

1533
01:40:33,640 --> 01:40:35,949
The portrait shack, for example.

1534
01:40:36,400 --> 01:40:37,879
Full of islanders,

1535
01:40:38,760 --> 01:40:41,115
women I encountered here and there,

1536
01:40:41,520 --> 01:40:42,953
all beautiful.

1537
01:40:46,080 --> 01:40:46,956
The same background

1538
01:40:47,120 --> 01:40:48,394
for each woman

1539
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:50,518
and another one for the men.

1540
01:40:50,760 --> 01:40:53,069
I went around with this background,

1541
01:40:53,240 --> 01:40:56,312
placing it behind
those who accepted to pose.

1542
01:41:00,400 --> 01:41:02,550
I also used them for my family.

1543
01:41:02,840 --> 01:41:04,068
Rosalie,

1544
01:41:05,240 --> 01:41:07,800
her three sons: Valentin,

1545
01:41:09,320 --> 01:41:10,719
Augustin

1546
01:41:11,960 --> 01:41:13,439
and Corentin.

1547
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:16,679
Mathieu,

1548
01:41:17,800 --> 01:41:19,233
Joséphine

1549
01:41:20,520 --> 01:41:23,353
and their son Constantin.

1550
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:26,515
Together,
they're the sum of my happiness.

1551
01:41:27,440 --> 01:41:30,159
But I don't know if I know them

1552
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:32,197
or understand them.

1553
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:35,510
I just go toward them.

1554
01:41:40,840 --> 01:41:43,149
One day a neighbor came to visit.

1555
01:41:43,320 --> 01:41:46,357
His father had filmed the mill,
that is now ours,

1556
01:41:46,520 --> 01:41:48,556
with a 9.5mm camera.

1557
01:41:48,880 --> 01:41:51,872
Thanks, Neighbor Satie,
for such rare images.

1558
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:56,909
The miller's name was Adam Gervier.
He had 11 children.

1559
01:42:02,480 --> 01:42:03,993
I got Mom!

1560
01:42:19,840 --> 01:42:21,796
Often I stop writing.

1561
01:42:22,920 --> 01:42:24,512
The world's in bad shape

1562
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:26,636
and I'm overwhelmed.

1563
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:31,553
At this very moment,
disasters, wars, earthquakes.

1564
01:42:32,040 --> 01:42:35,157
I sit in safety
and imagine those situations.

1565
01:42:35,760 --> 01:42:38,558
People without shelter,
entire families on the road.

1566
01:42:39,080 --> 01:42:40,911
I sit motionless

1567
01:42:41,080 --> 01:42:42,672
and think of my dear ones.

1568
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:46,913
Family is a somewhat compact concept.

1569
01:42:47,760 --> 01:42:50,320
We mentally group everyone together

1570
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:52,914
and imagine them as a peaceful island.

1571
01:43:25,640 --> 01:43:27,995
This shack has a story.

1572
01:43:28,160 --> 01:43:31,550
Once upon a time
two good and beautiful actors

1573
01:43:31,720 --> 01:43:35,156
played in a film
which turned out to be a flop.

1574
01:43:36,200 --> 01:43:37,679
Gleaner that I am,

1575
01:43:37,840 --> 01:43:40,638
I salvaged
the abandoned prints of the film

1576
01:43:40,800 --> 01:43:42,916
and unrolled the reels.

1577
01:43:43,360 --> 01:43:46,591
And the two good
and beautiful actors became

1578
01:43:46,760 --> 01:43:49,832
walls and surfaces, bathed in light.

1579
01:43:52,520 --> 01:43:54,397
What is cinema?

1580
01:43:55,280 --> 01:43:56,998
Light coming from somewhere

1581
01:43:57,160 --> 01:44:00,391
captured by images
more or less dark or colorful.

1582
01:44:05,760 --> 01:44:08,797
In here, it feels like I live in cinema,

1583
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:10,154
cinema is my home.

1584
01:44:11,320 --> 01:44:13,880
I think I've always lived in it.

1585
01:44:38,920 --> 01:44:40,148
It's not over!

1586
01:44:40,320 --> 01:44:42,072
Sometimes the curtain opens again!

1587
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:44,073
Someone's asking for you.

1588
01:44:44,240 --> 01:44:46,390
Happy birthday, Agnès!

1589
01:45:00,800 --> 01:45:03,234
After the fiesta I found myself alone

1590
01:45:03,400 --> 01:45:05,356
and I counted the brooms.

1591
01:45:05,520 --> 01:45:07,909
Yes, there were exactly 80 of them,

1592
01:45:08,240 --> 01:45:10,117
including these four.

1593
01:45:10,320 --> 01:45:12,675
Then another one, sent by email,

1594
01:45:12,840 --> 01:45:15,434
another of bloody Guillaume's ideas.

1595
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:19,032
It all happened yesterday
and it's already the past.

1596
01:45:20,960 --> 01:45:25,033
A sensation combined instantly
with the image, which will remain.

1597
01:45:27,240 --> 01:45:29,390
While I live, I remember.
