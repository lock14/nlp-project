00:01:13,221 --> 00:01:15,131
: Ah...

3
00:01:21,221 --> 00:01:23,229
MAN: Mm. What are you reading?

4
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:25,570
Hm?

5
00:01:25,669 --> 00:01:28,320
The Overcoat by Gogol.

6
00:01:28,421 --> 00:01:30,243
Gogol?
Uh-huh.

7
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:31,268
Mm-mm.

8
00:01:31,365 --> 00:01:33,275
Never heard of him.

9
00:01:41,701 --> 00:01:44,286
I'm just reading.

10
00:01:44,389 --> 00:01:45,916
My grandfather gave me this book.

11
00:01:46,021 --> 00:01:47,232
Hmm.

12
00:01:59,045 --> 00:02:00,354
Seen much of this world?

13
00:02:00,453 --> 00:02:02,144
Uh-uh. I went to Delhi once.

14
00:02:02,245 --> 00:02:05,594
Every year I visit my grandfather in Dungarpur.

15
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:07,130
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

16
00:02:07,237 --> 00:02:09,474
: Not this world.

17
00:02:09,573 --> 00:02:11,995
I mean, England, America.

18
00:02:12,101 --> 00:02:14,490
I was in England for two years.

19
00:02:14,597 --> 00:02:16,255
It was like a dream.

20
00:02:16,357 --> 00:02:19,706
Sparkling clean streets.

21
00:02:19,813 --> 00:02:21,820
Nobody spitting on the road.

22
00:02:21,925 --> 00:02:23,932
Have you ever thought
of going abroad?

23
00:02:24,037 --> 00:02:25,378
No.

24
00:02:25,477 --> 00:02:26,819
You should.

25
00:02:26,917 --> 00:02:27,931
You are young.

26
00:02:28,037 --> 00:02:29,924
You are free.

27
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:32,923
Let me tell you something.

28
00:02:33,029 --> 00:02:35,101
Pack a pillow and a blanket.

29
00:02:35,205 --> 00:02:36,699
See the world.

30
00:02:37,989 --> 00:02:40,127
You will never regret it.

31
00:02:40,229 --> 00:02:43,076
My grandfather always says
that is what books are for.

32
00:02:43,173 --> 00:02:44,002
Hmm.

33
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:46,468
To travel without moving an inch.

34
00:02:46,565 --> 00:02:48,157
: Mmm.

35
00:02:48,261 --> 00:02:50,170
To each his own.

41
00:05:48,485 --> 00:05:50,459
Sis, you're home late.

42
00:06:02,308 --> 00:06:04,764
Hurry, go and prepare yourself.

43
00:06:04,869 --> 00:06:07,258
There is someone waiting to see you.

44
00:06:22,277 --> 00:06:24,316
Watch and learn, Rini.

45
00:06:30,596 --> 00:06:32,025
Hm?

46
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:34,020
Mmm...

47
00:06:35,109 --> 00:06:36,931
She is fond of cooking.

48
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,003
And she can knit well.

49
00:06:39,109 --> 00:06:42,240
She made a cardigan for me in one week.

50
00:06:43,076 --> 00:06:46,786
She is the children's favorite Auntie.

51
00:07:12,836 --> 00:07:15,454
She has been
learning classical music since childhood.

52
00:07:15,557 --> 00:07:18,557
It's notjust that she is my daughter...

53
00:07:21,829 --> 00:07:23,106
Here she is.

54
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:48,321
Uh, my son has been living abroad...

55
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,013
for the last two years.

56
00:07:50,117 --> 00:07:51,840
He's in New York.

57
00:07:51,941 --> 00:07:54,559
He's doing his PhD in the
field of fiber optics.

58
00:07:54,661 --> 00:07:56,090
Hm?

59
00:07:56,196 --> 00:07:58,171
Hmm... hmm.

60
00:08:01,348 --> 00:08:02,941
Our daughter's best
subject is English.

61
00:08:05,829 --> 00:08:08,796
Won't you recite something for us?

62
00:08:17,189 --> 00:08:20,091
I wandered lonely as a cloud

63
00:08:20,196 --> 00:08:24,157
That floats on high
o'er vales and hills

64
00:08:24,261 --> 00:08:27,294
When all at once I saw a crowd...

65
00:08:27,397 --> 00:08:31,423
A host of golden daffodils.

66
00:08:31,524 --> 00:08:33,913
:
This was my father's

67
00:08:34,021 --> 00:08:35,515
favorite poem.

68
00:08:35,621 --> 00:08:37,563
Used to read a lot, my father.

69
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:40,574
Please.

70
00:08:43,236 --> 00:08:45,124
My child?

71
00:08:45,221 --> 00:08:47,522
Have you ever flown in a plane?

72
00:08:49,637 --> 00:08:51,459
Will you be able to go

73
00:08:51,557 --> 00:08:53,761
halfway across the world?

74
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:55,584
Live in a cold city...

75
00:08:55,685 --> 00:08:58,368
with freezing winters...

76
00:08:58,469 --> 00:09:02,047
Leaving your family and friends very far away?

77
00:09:05,156 --> 00:09:07,043
Won't you be lonely?

78
00:09:12,069 --> 00:09:14,524
Won't he be there?

79
00:09:14,629 --> 00:09:15,643
Huh? Oh!

80
00:09:24,964 --> 00:09:26,426
Come to me.

81
00:09:29,029 --> 00:09:31,484
Your life is about to change.

82
00:09:31,588 --> 00:09:34,719
Embrace the new.

83
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:37,341
Don't forget the old.

84
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:39,266
And your new life--

85
00:09:39,364 --> 00:09:41,120
Enjoy it fully.

86
00:09:58,085 --> 00:09:59,994
Let me see her.

00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:36,832
§ §

88
00:11:43,524 --> 00:11:45,466
Are you there?

89
00:11:59,684 --> 00:12:02,204
It is freezing today outside.

90
00:12:05,348 --> 00:12:07,683
Bread... milk...

91
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:09,755
apple tea...

92
00:12:09,860 --> 00:12:11,770
The rest we'll buy
from the Indian shop

93
00:12:11,876 --> 00:12:13,338
after I come home in the evening.

94
00:12:13,444 --> 00:12:15,267
You are going out?

95
00:12:15,364 --> 00:12:16,859
I've been away three weeks.

96
00:12:16,964 --> 00:12:18,393
I have to go.

97
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:26,305
How are you feeling?

98
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:30,148
It will take you
several days to recover.

99
00:12:30,244 --> 00:12:34,073
After all, you've just flown
halfway around the world.

100
00:12:36,068 --> 00:12:38,556
Go lie down. I'll bring you tea.

101
00:12:40,164 --> 00:12:42,685
It is the American way.

102
00:12:43,908 --> 00:12:46,177
Now go, go.

103
00:12:47,748 --> 00:12:48,959
I can't.

104
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:50,686
Okay.

105
00:12:50,788 --> 00:12:53,123
OK then, sit and watch.

106
00:12:53,221 --> 00:12:55,806
Here we get gas 24 hours of the day.

107
00:12:56,644 --> 00:12:59,066
Look, this is how you turn it on.

108
00:13:00,836 --> 00:13:02,080
Hot and cold water, too.

109
00:13:04,836 --> 00:13:06,495
Red one and blue one.

110
00:13:06,596 --> 00:13:07,905
Don't confuse between the two.

111
00:13:08,004 --> 00:13:09,084
You will get burned.

112
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:11,294
And you can drink water
straight from the tap.

113
00:13:11,396 --> 00:13:14,015
No need to boil it.

114
00:13:14,116 --> 00:13:15,523
Our washing machine is
just down the street.

115
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,246
I will show you when I come home.

116
00:13:22,756 --> 00:13:23,901
Now...

117
00:13:30,596 --> 00:13:31,938
Once you are settled,

118
00:13:32,036 --> 00:13:33,945
I will take you
to my department

119
00:13:34,053 --> 00:13:36,573
and introduce you
to my professor here.

120
00:13:36,677 --> 00:13:37,822
You won't believe it.

121
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:43,035
Our rickshaw drivers
dress better than professors here.

Just a minute.

No, no, no, no, no, no!

127
00:15:05,444 --> 00:15:07,267
ASHl MA: I am very happy.

128
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:10,299
And everything here is wonderful.

129
00:15:10,405 --> 00:15:13,471
The planejourney
was long but enjoyable.

130
00:15:13,572 --> 00:15:15,547
And I'm feeling fine.

131
00:15:15,652 --> 00:15:17,343
How is Rini?

132
00:15:17,444 --> 00:15:19,583
The house is very nice.

133
00:15:19,684 --> 00:15:21,572
Big, with lots of windows.

134
00:15:21,668 --> 00:15:23,643
Do you know...

135
00:15:23,749 --> 00:15:25,691
over here...

136
00:15:25,796 --> 00:15:27,869
we get gas all day and all night.

137
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:35,042
All these have shrunk.

138
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,507
I mean, who asked you to wash my clothes?

139
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:39,938
Why didn't you just wait until I came back?

140
00:15:40,036 --> 00:15:42,076
Here one dollar is 8 rupees.

141
00:15:42,180 --> 00:15:43,741
We only have so much money to buy...

142
00:15:43,844 --> 00:15:44,989
Where are you going?

143
00:15:45,092 --> 00:15:45,888
Hel...

144
00:15:53,124 --> 00:15:53,920
Ashima.

145
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,027
Ashima?

146
00:15:57,380 --> 00:15:58,907
Open the door, Ashima.

147
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,028
I'm sorry.

148
00:16:09,124 --> 00:16:11,033
Ashima.

149
00:16:11,141 --> 00:16:12,864
It's my fault.

150
00:16:12,964 --> 00:16:14,240
Your intention was good.

151
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,867
It was my mistake not to tell you.

152
00:16:15,972 --> 00:16:17,794
Ashima, please, open the door.

153
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,547
My Ashima.

154
00:16:20,644 --> 00:16:25,281
My Ashima, crazy Ashima,
open the door, Ashima.

Oh, my dear, open the door.

Don't smile.

Fulton Street.

Get out of the station,
ask anybody...

"Where is the Fulton fish market?"

165
00:17:20,964 --> 00:17:23,037
And if I get lost?

166
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:27,105

Come.

172
00:19:16,548 --> 00:19:18,752
Come to me.

173
00:20:16,964 --> 00:20:18,873
Do you have a longer frock?

174
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,157
What's that?

175
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,009
Uh... I need to here.

176
00:20:23,108 --> 00:20:25,083
And hide those gorgeous legs?

177
00:20:25,188 --> 00:20:27,643
Here we go. Let's get you
under the covers. Here we go.

178
00:20:27,748 --> 00:20:29,887
All right.

179
00:20:30,884 --> 00:20:33,437
Time those contractions.

180
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,721
All there.

181
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:33,471
I already checked.

182
00:21:36,996 --> 00:21:40,508
His eyes are black as a blackberry.

183

Black as his hair.

How are you feeling? Was it all right?

185
00:22:07,236 --> 00:22:10,465
Being rescued was the first miracle of my life.

186
00:22:10,564 --> 00:22:13,411
You are the second.

187
00:22:26,596 --> 00:22:30,208
Mrs. Ganguli, I'm Mr. Wilcox.

188
00:22:31,780 --> 00:22:34,201
You, um, have a name for the baby?

189
00:22:34,308 --> 00:22:35,322
One minute.

190
00:22:35,428 --> 00:22:36,802
My husband is coming.

191
00:22:36,900 --> 00:22:38,689
He's asking about the baby's name.

192
00:22:38,787 --> 00:22:40,282
Yes, the name.

193
00:22:40,388 --> 00:22:42,493
We are waiting for my wife's
grandmother to choose.

194
00:22:42,596 --> 00:22:44,287
Will she be here soon?

195
00:22:44,388 --> 00:22:46,690
She is in India.

196
00:22:46,788 --> 00:22:48,926
She is more than 85 years old.

197
00:22:49,028 --> 00:22:50,719
But there is no hurry.

198
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,346
Some of my cousins, you know,
they were not named

199
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:54,012
until they were six years old.

200
00:22:54,116 --> 00:22:55,971
Until then they were all called
by their daknams only.

201
00:22:56,067 --> 00:22:57,278
Daknams?

202
00:22:57,379 --> 00:22:58,208
Pet names.

203
00:22:58,308 --> 00:22:59,552
We all have two names.

204
00:22:59,651 --> 00:23:01,342
One pet name-- daknam.

205
00:23:01,444 --> 00:23:02,654
One good name-- bhalonam.

206
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,952
Unfortunately in this country
a baby can't be released

207
00:23:06,052 --> 00:23:08,256
from the hospital without
a birth certificate,

208
00:23:08,356 --> 00:23:10,363
and a birth certificate
requires a name.

209
00:23:10,467 --> 00:23:13,729
How about"Baby Boy Ganguli"?

210
00:23:13,828 --> 00:23:15,322
Baby Boy?

211
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:18,242
Uh, uh, till
the letter arrives.

212
00:23:18,340 --> 00:23:19,518
Afterward we can change it?

213
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:21,376
Is that what we should do?

214
00:23:21,475 --> 00:23:22,653
I wouldn't.

215
00:23:22,756 --> 00:23:24,130
Endless red tape.

216
00:23:24,228 --> 00:23:25,438
Expensive, too.

217
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,554
Sleep on it.

218
00:23:28,676 --> 00:23:32,287
Baby Boy Ganguli?

219
00:23:34,819 --> 00:23:36,729
Gogol.

220
00:23:38,948 --> 00:23:40,857
Gogoloo.

221
00:23:42,595 --> 00:23:44,505
What do you say?

222
00:23:44,612 --> 00:23:47,295
We could call him Gogol.

223
00:23:47,395 --> 00:23:49,283
Till the letter arrives.

224
00:23:49,379 --> 00:23:51,900
Later we could change it
on the birth certificate.

225
00:23:54,883 --> 00:23:56,542
Mmm.

226
00:23:56,643 --> 00:23:59,840
We would not be here
but for Gogol's blessings.

227
00:24:01,988 --> 00:24:03,297
Hold still.

228
00:24:03,396 --> 00:24:04,541
Hold still.

229
00:24:04,644 --> 00:24:06,553
Don't move.

230
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:08,961
One, two, three.

231
00:24:09,060 --> 00:24:10,816
Say"cheese."

232
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,442
Uncle, Auntie.

233
00:24:16,548 --> 00:24:17,955
Look, Gogol.

234
00:24:22,563 --> 00:24:24,385
Did this just come?

235
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:32,122
How beautiful.

236
00:24:38,372 --> 00:24:39,746
...Gogol!

237
00:24:39,843 --> 00:24:42,080
Gogol!
Hey, lady-killer!

238
00:24:51,556 --> 00:24:53,182
I want to go home.

239
00:24:55,044 --> 00:24:58,306
I don't want to raise Gogol
in this lonely country.

240
00:25:00,419 --> 00:25:03,932
Think of Gogol's future.

241
00:25:04,036 --> 00:25:06,719
This is the land
of opportunity, Ashima.

242
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,406
He can become
whatever he wants,

243
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,329
study whatever he desires.

244
00:25:11,427 --> 00:25:13,599
You know, options are limitless.

245
00:25:13,699 --> 00:25:16,252
Don't you want to give him that?

246
00:25:16,356 --> 00:25:18,265
Huh?

247
00:25:28,228 --> 00:25:29,886
Here you go.

248
00:25:29,988 --> 00:25:31,875
Thanks.
You're welcome.

249
00:25:31,972 --> 00:25:33,914
Come here.

250
00:25:34,019 --> 00:25:35,842
Yeah.

251
00:25:35,939 --> 00:25:37,117
Fish.

252
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,397
Leave it, leave it, leave it.

253
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,322
Come. Come.

254
00:25:50,468 --> 00:25:53,119
Don't go so far

255
00:25:53,219 --> 00:25:54,878
that I cannot see you!

256
00:25:54,979 --> 00:25:56,954
He's too little!

257
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:16,641
MAN: Welcome to suburbia, Ashoke.

258
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:18,147
You have a beautiful house, Ashoke.

259
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:19,454
Congratulations.

260
00:26:19,556 --> 00:26:21,378
Everything is bought in a yard sale.

261
00:26:21,476 --> 00:26:22,905
Ashima does not like it,

262
00:26:23,012 --> 00:26:24,834
but I say, what is wrong
with it, you know?

263
00:26:24,932 --> 00:26:27,834
Even my chairman,
who lives in a huge mansion,

264
00:26:27,939 --> 00:26:30,623
wears a tie he had
bought for 50 cents.

265
00:26:32,131 --> 00:26:33,986
That is America, Ashoke.

266
00:26:35,267 --> 00:26:36,195
Hey, guys.

267
00:26:36,292 --> 00:26:39,608
Hey, kids, catch it.

268
00:26:39,716 --> 00:26:41,625
ASHl MA: Gogol?

269
00:26:43,139 --> 00:26:44,895
Where are you?

270
00:26:44,995 --> 00:26:48,257
Hey, Gogoli.

271
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,212
Poor Baba.

272
00:26:53,316 --> 00:26:55,388
He's probably
feeling very left out

273
00:26:55,492 --> 00:26:57,979
because of his sister
Sonia's naming ceremony.

274
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,741
Is he going to be called Gogol
in school?

275
00:26:59,844 --> 00:27:00,956
No.

276
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:02,685
We have decided on a good name.

277
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:03,715
Finally.

278
00:27:03,811 --> 00:27:04,989
What is it?

279
00:27:05,092 --> 00:27:07,099
Nikhil.
Bah.

280
00:27:07,204 --> 00:27:08,927
The all-encompassing one.

281
00:27:09,028 --> 00:27:12,890
Of course they will turn it
into Nick, you know.

282
00:27:12,995 --> 00:27:14,686
Gogol?

283
00:27:14,788 --> 00:27:17,243
Hey, Gogol.

284
00:27:17,347 --> 00:27:18,841
He's here.

285
00:27:19,908 --> 00:27:21,217
Missing your sister's ceremony, huh?

286
00:27:21,316 --> 00:27:23,869
Hey, Gogoli.

287
00:27:23,971 --> 00:27:25,597
I found him!

288
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,674
GOGOL: I don't like the baby.

289
00:27:31,108 --> 00:27:33,563
Sonia, eat this.

290
00:27:33,667 --> 00:27:35,194
And now will be the grand finale.

291
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,227
Ashima.

292
00:27:36,324 --> 00:27:38,179
What will your baby
girl's future be?

293
00:27:38,275 --> 00:27:41,407
Her future will soon be revealed.

294
00:27:43,619 --> 00:27:44,896
She wants everything.

295
00:27:44,995 --> 00:27:46,719
Ask her to pick up the pen.

296
00:27:46,820 --> 00:27:49,503
Hey, Sonia, pick up the pen.

297
00:27:49,604 --> 00:27:50,978
Pick up, pick up.
Be the first female...

298
00:27:51,076 --> 00:27:52,767
Put the dollar in her hand.

299
00:27:52,867 --> 00:27:55,006
Pick up something, Sonia.

300
00:27:55,108 --> 00:27:56,995
American girl must be rich.

301
00:28:02,084 --> 00:28:04,156
She's not picking anything.

302
00:28:11,428 --> 00:28:13,216
So...

303
00:28:13,315 --> 00:28:15,770
how did you like your first day
in big school?

304
00:28:15,876 --> 00:28:17,915
Great!
Oh.

305
00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:20,441
And what is this?

306
00:28:24,451 --> 00:28:27,004
"Due to your son's
preference,

307
00:28:27,108 --> 00:28:30,490
"he will be known as
Gogol in school.

308
00:28:30,595 --> 00:28:33,661
Mrs. Lapidis, Principal."

309
00:28:34,659 --> 00:28:36,514
Hmm.

310
00:28:40,323 --> 00:28:42,942
And what about your
parents' preference?

311
00:28:43,043 --> 00:28:44,505
Hmm?

312
00:28:46,819 --> 00:28:49,470
ASHl MA:
In this country the children decide.

313
00:28:49,571 --> 00:28:53,500
He wants to keep Gogol
and not Nikhil as his good name.

314
00:28:53,603 --> 00:28:54,880
Fine.

315
00:28:54,979 --> 00:28:56,802
No big deal.

316
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:02,046
With a president named Jimmy,
there is nothing we can do.

317
00:29:02,147 --> 00:29:04,864
As long as our kid is
happy, you know.

318
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:17,247
So late?

319
00:29:19,652 --> 00:29:20,797
Hello.

320
00:29:20,899 --> 00:29:22,655
Hello?

321
00:29:25,475 --> 00:29:27,580
MAN: Hello, Ashoke...

322
00:29:27,684 --> 00:29:30,139
Can you hear me?

323
00:29:31,428 --> 00:29:33,151
I have terrible news.

324
00:29:37,188 --> 00:29:38,879
I can't tell my sister.

325
00:29:39,908 --> 00:29:42,657
Don't, don't worry, I, I will.

326
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:48,796
ASHl MA:
He told you something you're not telling me?

327
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,129
Yesterday when
your father was

328
00:29:59,235 --> 00:30:01,690
playing patience
on his bed,

329
00:30:01,795 --> 00:30:04,064
he died of a heart attack.

330
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,437
Father!

331
00:30:23,427 --> 00:30:25,761
Be calm, Ashima.

332
00:30:26,596 --> 00:30:29,116
At least he went peacefully.

333
00:30:41,795 --> 00:30:44,283
§ §

334
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:06,717
Gogol, go on.

335
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:09,024
Go on.
Look, Baba, Gogol!

336
00:31:09,123 --> 00:31:10,268
Where?

337
00:31:10,371 --> 00:31:11,800
Ashima.
G-O...

338
00:31:11,907 --> 00:31:14,690
...G-O-L!

339
00:31:14,787 --> 00:31:17,176
ASHOKE: Oh, very good, very good.

340
00:31:17,283 --> 00:31:18,493
Come on, we'll lose the plane.

341
00:31:18,595 --> 00:31:20,417
Huh? Come on, come on.

342
00:31:30,115 --> 00:31:31,806
I can't go.

343
00:31:32,867 --> 00:31:35,584
I can't bear to see them in mourning.

344
00:31:35,683 --> 00:31:37,952
You can't be like this.

345
00:31:40,643 --> 00:31:41,690
Think of your mother.

346
00:31:41,795 --> 00:31:43,322
Think of your son.

347
00:31:44,868 --> 00:31:47,650
They need you to be strong.

348
00:31:50,563 --> 00:31:52,451
Push, push, push...

349
00:32:18,468 --> 00:32:21,883
Not your ordinary
guy, Nikolai Gogol.

350
00:32:21,987 --> 00:32:23,897
Hey, Gogol, it's your namesake.

351
00:32:25,315 --> 00:32:26,809
Today, he is respected

352
00:32:26,915 --> 00:32:29,336
as one of Russia's
most brilliant writers,

353
00:32:29,443 --> 00:32:31,832
but in his own lifetime
he was understood by no one.

354
00:32:31,939 --> 00:32:33,150
Least of all himself.

355
00:32:33,251 --> 00:32:34,145
One might say

356
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:36,610
that he was an eccentric genius.

357
00:32:36,708 --> 00:32:38,202
Yo, Gargle, way to go!

358
00:32:38,307 --> 00:32:39,551
Shut up!
Hey, Mr. Hatch!

359
00:32:39,651 --> 00:32:41,058
Mr. Epstein!

360
00:32:41,155 --> 00:32:42,399
I will see you both after class.

361
00:32:42,499 --> 00:32:43,677
Thank you. Out. Come on.

362
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,722
Out.

363
00:32:47,875 --> 00:32:49,598
Thank you,

364
00:32:49,699 --> 00:32:51,935
gentlemen.

365
00:32:52,035 --> 00:32:56,159
Now, Gogol was reputed
to be a hypochondriac.

366
00:32:56,260 --> 00:32:57,666
He was deeply paranoid,

367
00:32:57,763 --> 00:32:59,673
frustrated, friendless.

368
00:32:59,779 --> 00:33:02,529
He never married
and he fathered no children.

369
00:33:02,628 --> 00:33:05,410
Ooh.
Towards the end of his life

370
00:33:05,508 --> 00:33:07,809
he proceeded
to commit slow suicide

371
00:33:07,907 --> 00:33:09,533
by starvation.
Gl RL: What?!

372
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:13,020
Did you guys know
all this stuff

373
00:33:13,123 --> 00:33:14,334
about him when you
decided to name me?

374
00:33:14,435 --> 00:33:17,217
That he was paranoid, suicidal,
friendless, depressed?

375
00:33:17,315 --> 00:33:19,650
ASHOKE: You forgot to
mention that he was

376
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:22,136
also a genius.

377
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:25,474
I don't understand
how you guys could

378
00:33:25,571 --> 00:33:27,327
name me after someone so strange.

379
00:33:27,427 --> 00:33:28,889
Don't talk back to your father.

380
00:33:30,403 --> 00:33:32,924
And don't call us"guys."

381
00:33:33,027 --> 00:33:34,304
Sometimes when l
close my eyes

382
00:33:34,403 --> 00:33:35,451
and listen to you both,

383
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,922
I feel I have given
birth to strangers.

384
00:33:39,427 --> 00:33:40,507
Just because you're graduating

385
00:33:40,611 --> 00:33:42,553
does not mean you can
behave like this, Gogol.

386
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:56,953
So, I'm two inches away from her.

387
00:33:57,059 --> 00:33:58,553
Her luscious lips part.

388
00:33:58,659 --> 00:34:01,693
Just as I'm about to kiss her...

389
00:34:01,795 --> 00:34:05,111
she looks at me and she says...

390
00:34:05,219 --> 00:34:06,626
"What's your name?"

391
00:34:08,067 --> 00:34:09,823
Gogol Ganguli.

392
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,418
End of Seduction 101.

393
00:34:11,523 --> 00:34:14,490
Plain Jane loves your name.

394
00:34:14,595 --> 00:34:16,122
:
Gogol, Gogol, I love you.

395
00:34:16,227 --> 00:34:18,464
Gogol!
Oh, Gogol!

396
00:34:18,563 --> 00:34:20,386
Don't bogart that joint, man.

397
00:34:20,483 --> 00:34:22,010
You know, of all
the frickin'

398
00:34:22,115 --> 00:34:24,220
Russian writers in the universe...

399
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,181
...why'd they have to go
and choose the weirdest?

400
00:34:29,283 --> 00:34:32,599
What the hell's wrong
with Leo or Anton?

401
00:34:32,707 --> 00:34:35,839
Shit. You know, I just want
to sit 'em down and be, like,

402
00:34:35,939 --> 00:34:38,361
"Man, Gogol is your
favorite author, not mine."

403
00:34:38,467 --> 00:34:40,290
Shit.

404
00:34:40,387 --> 00:34:41,598
What?

405
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:44,066
I got the thing. Oh, shit.

406
00:34:45,475 --> 00:34:47,362
Hey, where you going?

407
00:34:47,459 --> 00:34:48,736
See ya!

408
00:34:48,835 --> 00:34:50,525
Good-bye, Air India!

409
00:34:50,627 --> 00:34:52,766
Whoo-hoo!

410
00:35:00,419 --> 00:35:01,433
: I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

411
00:35:01,539 --> 00:35:03,994
They have been here
for two hours already. Come.

412
00:35:05,635 --> 00:35:07,358
This is our son, Gogol.

413
00:35:07,459 --> 00:35:09,663
Sorry I'm late.
ASHOKE: Hey, Gogol.

414
00:35:09,763 --> 00:35:11,519
Mr. and Mrs. Mazumdar,
they just moved

415
00:35:11,619 --> 00:35:13,081
into New York from London.

416
00:35:13,187 --> 00:35:14,976
Oh, wow, that's far.

417
00:35:16,259 --> 00:35:18,398
WOMAN: Hey, Gogol...

418
00:35:18,499 --> 00:35:20,800
Hey, Mira Mashi.
I'll show you something.

419
00:35:21,859 --> 00:35:23,746
And this is our daughter, Moushumi.

420
00:35:25,795 --> 00:35:28,250
Both the same age also.
Oh.

421
00:35:28,355 --> 00:35:29,762
They'll have a lot in common.

422
00:35:29,859 --> 00:35:31,648
Oh, I'm sure.

423
00:35:31,747 --> 00:35:32,859
GOGOL: Hi.

424
00:35:32,963 --> 00:35:34,239
: Hello.

425
00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:36,281
What are you reading?

426
00:35:36,387 --> 00:35:37,980
Bonjour Tristesse.

427
00:35:38,083 --> 00:35:40,385
In French.
Oh...

428
00:35:40,483 --> 00:35:42,392
Want to go watch some TV?

429
00:35:43,811 --> 00:35:47,127
I detest American television.

430
00:35:47,235 --> 00:35:49,340
Ml RA MASHl: Gogol...

431
00:35:49,443 --> 00:35:52,029
Come and sit next
to your Mira Mashi.

432
00:35:52,131 --> 00:35:54,717
Come. Come.

433
00:35:56,771 --> 00:35:57,981
Why are your eyes so red?

434
00:36:01,027 --> 00:36:03,231
Someone's envy has definitely...

435
00:36:03,331 --> 00:36:04,378
I'm fine.

436
00:36:04,483 --> 00:36:06,370
Ashima...

437
00:36:06,467 --> 00:36:07,514
Chilies.

438
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:08,480
Nicky?

439
00:36:14,467 --> 00:36:16,289
Hmm. Oh, Mira Mashi.

440
00:36:16,387 --> 00:36:18,875
I promise you there
are no evil eyes

441
00:36:18,979 --> 00:36:20,505
in the United States of America.

442
00:36:20,611 --> 00:36:22,683
That is what you think.

443
00:36:22,787 --> 00:36:24,445
You be careful where you're going.

444
00:36:24,547 --> 00:36:26,041
What is the name?

445
00:36:26,147 --> 00:36:27,292
Yale.

446
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:29,697
There will be plenty of girls

447
00:36:29,795 --> 00:36:31,256
in this Yale place

448
00:36:31,363 --> 00:36:33,053
who will want to trap you.

449
00:36:33,155 --> 00:36:35,544
Have as much fun as you want.

450
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,025
Mm-hmm.
But...

451
00:36:37,123 --> 00:36:40,287
BOTH: Marry a Bengali.

452
00:37:06,339 --> 00:37:08,095
Gogol?

453
00:37:09,283 --> 00:37:10,527
Hey, Baba.

454
00:37:12,707 --> 00:37:13,983
How are you feeling now?

455
00:37:14,083 --> 00:37:15,806
Yeah, I'm feeling a lot better.
Uh-huh.

456
00:37:15,907 --> 00:37:17,882
Thank you.
Good.

457
00:37:20,514 --> 00:37:22,587
Listen.

458
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:24,862
I have never given
you any presents

459
00:37:24,962 --> 00:37:27,166
apart from what
your mother buys, but...

460
00:37:27,267 --> 00:37:28,543
for your graduation,

461
00:37:28,643 --> 00:37:30,945
I have something special.

462
00:37:31,043 --> 00:37:33,017
§ §

463
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:39,101
Thanks, Baba.

464
00:37:42,435 --> 00:37:43,996
I ordered this

465
00:37:44,099 --> 00:37:45,725
just for you from the bookstore.

466
00:37:45,827 --> 00:37:47,256
Took four months to arrive.

467
00:38:06,146 --> 00:38:07,902
I hope you like it.

468
00:38:08,003 --> 00:38:09,825
Very nice.

469
00:38:09,923 --> 00:38:11,745
Thanks, Baba.

470
00:38:15,203 --> 00:38:17,090
Thanks again.

471
00:38:27,266 --> 00:38:30,016
You know, I feel a special
kinship with Gogol

472
00:38:30,115 --> 00:38:32,930
more than with any other writer.

473
00:38:34,243 --> 00:38:36,250
Do you know why?
Yes.

474
00:38:36,354 --> 00:38:39,169
Gogol's your favorite author.
I know, Baba.

475
00:38:41,187 --> 00:38:42,681
Apart from that,

476
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:45,950
he spent most of his adult life

477
00:38:46,051 --> 00:38:47,873
outside his homeland.

478
00:38:48,899 --> 00:38:50,841
Like me.
Right.

479
00:38:54,115 --> 00:38:56,700
But...

480
00:38:56,803 --> 00:38:59,323
there...

481
00:38:59,427 --> 00:39:01,118
there is another reason.

482
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,460
Hello?

483
00:39:10,562 --> 00:39:12,155
Hmm?

484
00:39:12,259 --> 00:39:14,942
What's the other reason?

485
00:39:18,467 --> 00:39:20,922
No, there isn't.

486
00:39:30,499 --> 00:39:32,222
Okay, good night.

487
00:39:32,323 --> 00:39:34,210
Good night, Baba.

488
00:39:40,771 --> 00:39:44,000
We all came out of Gogol's overcoat.

489
00:39:45,155 --> 00:39:46,977
One day you will understand.

490
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,778
MAN  :
Your attention, please.

491
00:39:50,882 --> 00:39:53,054
Indian Airlines announces

492
00:39:53,154 --> 00:39:56,929
the departure of their
flight Ic408 to Calcutta.

493
00:39:59,074 --> 00:40:01,530

WOMAN: Flight Ic408.

497
00:40:18,819 --> 00:40:20,892
§ §

498
00:41:04,323 --> 00:41:06,013
Take out the luggage.

499
00:41:06,114 --> 00:41:08,285
Gogol!
Hi, Daadima.

500
00:41:09,699 --> 00:41:11,325
Take her size.

501
00:41:18,211 --> 00:41:19,967
Earphones.
Earphones!

502
00:41:20,066 --> 00:41:23,066
Go buy two pairs of slippers from Bata.

503
00:41:23,906 --> 00:41:25,532
Only from Bata.

504
00:41:27,875 --> 00:41:29,566
Please take your present.

505
00:41:43,362 --> 00:41:45,599
For you, mother-in-law,
a sweet for a sweet.

506
00:41:54,563 --> 00:41:56,057
Oh, New York and Calcutta.

507
00:42:01,090 --> 00:42:03,294
What's wrong with you?

508
00:42:03,395 --> 00:42:04,704
I want to go home.

509
00:42:06,531 --> 00:42:08,473
I have something
that'll cheer you up.

510
00:42:11,491 --> 00:42:13,662
Here. My planner says

511
00:42:13,763 --> 00:42:15,486
that there are only

512
00:42:15,587 --> 00:42:17,954
89 days left to go.

513
00:42:19,682 --> 00:42:21,340
What is wrong with you?

514
00:42:21,443 --> 00:42:23,101
What, are you hot?
You're hot? Here.

515
00:42:23,203 --> 00:42:24,610
Have some ancient air conditioning.

516
00:42:24,707 --> 00:42:26,529
Go away!

517
00:42:45,506 --> 00:42:46,651
You are going out?

518
00:42:46,755 --> 00:42:49,144
Jogging.

519
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,494
Jogging?
Running.

520
00:42:50,595 --> 00:42:51,904
On the street.

521
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:54,424
I'm in training.
Training?

522
00:42:54,531 --> 00:42:57,182
Yep. Don't worry, Daadima.

523
00:42:57,282 --> 00:42:58,940
I'm not gonna go far.

524
00:42:59,042 --> 00:43:00,384
Chotu?

525
00:43:00,483 --> 00:43:02,904
Chotu?
Ah. What?

526
00:43:03,011 --> 00:43:05,050
Quick. Follow young master.

527
00:43:05,154 --> 00:43:06,561
He's gone running on the street.

528
00:43:06,659 --> 00:43:07,520
Keep your eye on him.

529
00:43:07,619 --> 00:43:08,382
Can you do that?

530
00:43:08,483 --> 00:43:10,338
I can do anything. I know English.

531
00:43:11,778 --> 00:43:13,666
Oh, good morning.

532
00:43:18,083 --> 00:43:20,123
Gogol, Gogol, Gogol!

533
00:43:20,226 --> 00:43:21,688
Gogol!

534
00:43:23,458 --> 00:43:25,346
Take pity on a fat man!

535
00:43:27,523 --> 00:43:29,890
Stop!

536
00:43:29,986 --> 00:43:31,361
Gogol!

537
00:43:31,459 --> 00:43:33,346
Stop!

538
00:43:40,355 --> 00:43:42,362
Grandma said to keep my eye on you.

539
00:43:46,371 --> 00:43:47,451
They sent you to follow me.

540
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:53,689
Heart.

541
00:43:55,074 --> 00:43:57,114
Chotu... die.
Don't die.

542
00:43:57,218 --> 00:43:58,495
Want to go back?

543
00:44:20,706 --> 00:44:23,194
There is something
I always wanted to ask you,

544
00:44:23,299 --> 00:44:25,720
but never had the courage.

545
00:44:25,827 --> 00:44:28,860
All those years ago, why did you...

546
00:44:28,963 --> 00:44:31,297
say yes to me?

547
00:44:32,642 --> 00:44:35,098
You were the best of the lot.

548
00:44:35,202 --> 00:44:36,412
Huh?

549
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:41,306
Better than the widower
with four children

550
00:44:41,410 --> 00:44:43,777
and the cartoonist with one arm.

551
00:44:43,875 --> 00:44:45,052
Gl RL: Please?

552
00:44:45,154 --> 00:44:46,648
You have an extra..?

553
00:44:46,755 --> 00:44:47,965
Oh, my God...

554
00:44:48,067 --> 00:44:50,368
I also liked your shoes.

555
00:44:52,578 --> 00:44:54,553
Oh. Oh, okay, okay.

556
00:44:58,306 --> 00:45:01,623
You want me to say...

557
00:45:01,730 --> 00:45:04,796
"I love you"...

558
00:45:04,899 --> 00:45:07,582
like the Americans?

559
00:45:07,682 --> 00:45:09,111
Eh.

560
00:45:09,218 --> 00:45:12,153
Huh.

561
00:45:12,259 --> 00:45:14,081
Huh.

562
00:45:26,658 --> 00:45:28,447
Stop sulking, Sonia.

563
00:45:28,547 --> 00:45:30,434
You actually look really
great in that outfit.

564
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:31,937
It suits you.
Shut up!

565
00:45:32,034 --> 00:45:33,659
Hmm.

566
00:45:33,762 --> 00:45:35,835
Why don't you get in,
my American son?

567
00:45:35,938 --> 00:45:37,531
Sonia can sit on my lap.

568
00:45:37,635 --> 00:45:39,064
Come on.
No. Because being pulled

569
00:45:39,170 --> 00:45:40,926
by another human being
is feudal and exploitative,

570
00:45:41,027 --> 00:45:43,165
and I don't want to be part
of something like that,

571
00:45:43,266 --> 00:45:44,957
because...
Hmm.

572
00:45:46,371 --> 00:45:48,159
Ma, stop!

573
00:45:48,258 --> 00:45:49,370
It's embarrassing me!

574
00:45:50,723 --> 00:45:52,730
Okay, guess where
we are going tomorrow.

575
00:45:52,835 --> 00:45:54,209
Another relative's house?

576
00:45:54,307 --> 00:45:55,289
No.

577
00:45:55,394 --> 00:45:56,921
The botanical gardens,
for the hundredth time.

578
00:45:57,026 --> 00:45:59,361
To Agra to see the Taj Mahal.

579
00:45:59,459 --> 00:46:01,052
Are you serious?
You're not kidding?

580
00:46:01,154 --> 00:46:02,082
Really?

581
00:46:02,178 --> 00:46:03,488
Mm.
That's awesome, Ma.

582
00:46:03,586 --> 00:46:04,514
Oh, my God!

583
00:46:04,611 --> 00:46:06,367
It's a wonder of the world.

584
00:46:14,274 --> 00:46:15,768
Come on.

585
00:46:31,362 --> 00:46:32,791
We should have taken the plane.

586
00:46:32,898 --> 00:46:35,265
Don't worry. Everything is fine.

587
00:46:35,362 --> 00:46:37,086
Nothing is fine.

588
00:46:41,570 --> 00:46:43,512
It's right here.

589
00:46:43,619 --> 00:46:44,601
Huh?

590
00:47:48,099 --> 00:47:50,466
§ §

591
00:48:24,514 --> 00:48:26,816
I've always wanted
to come here with you.

592
00:48:33,827 --> 00:48:38,464
Just imagine how much Shah Jahan
must have loved Mumtaz

593
00:48:38,562 --> 00:48:41,661
to make this for her.

594
00:48:41,762 --> 00:48:44,631
Other husbands also love
their wives, Ashima.

595
00:48:44,739 --> 00:48:50,041
Only we cannot afford
to build Taj Mahals.

596
00:48:52,258 --> 00:48:54,647
Hey, guess what?

597
00:48:54,754 --> 00:48:56,542
I think I'm gonna major
in architecture.

598
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:57,951
What about engineering?

599
00:48:58,050 --> 00:48:59,512
Come on, Baba.

600
00:48:59,618 --> 00:49:00,828
Architecture has everything.

601
00:49:00,930 --> 00:49:02,239
It's got engineering, drawing,

602
00:49:02,338 --> 00:49:04,313
aesthetics.

603
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:07,450
Our family Shah Jahan.

604
00:49:16,067 --> 00:49:18,074
§ §

605
00:49:25,474 --> 00:49:27,449
Show you something.

606
00:50:05,731 --> 00:50:07,137
Look.

607
00:50:07,234 --> 00:50:09,755
"Gangrene."

608
00:50:09,858 --> 00:50:11,680
What the...

609
00:50:14,562 --> 00:50:16,155
Can you believe this?

610
00:50:16,258 --> 00:50:18,298
I'm gonna catch
the racist punk who did that.

611
00:50:18,402 --> 00:50:19,809
ASHl MA: Don't be upset. Come on.

612
00:50:19,906 --> 00:50:21,215
Frickin' welcome home.

613
00:50:21,314 --> 00:50:23,201
Just some kids having fun.

614
00:50:34,754 --> 00:50:36,576
GOGOL:
So,

615
00:50:36,674 --> 00:50:39,969
I've been thinking a lot
about my name.

616
00:50:42,242 --> 00:50:44,413
"Gogol's" fine on-on
my high school diploma,

617
00:50:44,514 --> 00:50:47,264
but can you imagine"Gogol"

618
00:50:47,362 --> 00:50:50,494
on a résumé or a
credit card after that?

619
00:50:50,594 --> 00:50:52,929
What are you trying to say?

620
00:50:54,434 --> 00:50:57,336
I'd like to change my name back
to my good name.

621
00:50:58,402 --> 00:51:01,020
ASHl MA: What is done is done.

622
00:51:01,122 --> 00:51:03,129
Now Gogol has become your good name.

623
00:51:03,234 --> 00:51:04,543
It's too complicated now.

624
00:51:04,642 --> 00:51:05,690
You're too old.

625
00:51:05,794 --> 00:51:07,485
And anyway,
you have only yourself

626
00:51:07,586 --> 00:51:09,342
to blame.
Oh, yeah.

627
00:51:09,442 --> 00:51:11,352
It's my fault
'cause I was four years old?

628
00:51:11,458 --> 00:51:12,920
That's right, Goggles.

629
00:51:13,026 --> 00:51:14,401
Ow!

630
00:51:15,906 --> 00:51:18,427
Anything is possible in America.

631
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:21,312
Do as you wish.

632
00:51:50,274 --> 00:51:52,216
An excellent choice, sir.

633
00:52:13,794 --> 00:52:15,517
GOGOL: I'm home.

634
00:52:15,618 --> 00:52:16,731
Hi, Nick.

635
00:52:16,834 --> 00:52:18,361
Hello.

636
00:52:18,466 --> 00:52:20,539
Hi, Lydia.
How you doing?

637
00:52:20,642 --> 00:52:22,048
Good. Have you got it?

638
00:52:22,146 --> 00:52:23,968
Yup.

639
00:52:25,474 --> 00:52:26,619
Where's my girl?

640
00:52:26,722 --> 00:52:28,544
Where's my Master of Fine Arts?

641
00:52:28,642 --> 00:52:30,300
Congratulations.

642
00:52:30,402 --> 00:52:31,995
Thank you, Daddy.

643
00:52:34,594 --> 00:52:36,416
Thank you all so much for coming.

644
00:52:36,514 --> 00:52:38,270
This means so much to me.

645
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:40,574
Drink! Celebrate!

646
00:52:42,018 --> 00:52:43,479
Beep, beep! Excuse me,
darling. Sorry.

647
00:52:43,586 --> 00:52:44,895
Ooh. There we go.

648
00:52:44,993 --> 00:52:46,237
Cake?

649
00:52:46,338 --> 00:52:47,712
I still can't believe
it's over already.

650
00:52:47,810 --> 00:52:49,087
Hey.
I'm gonna get a drink.

651
00:52:49,186 --> 00:52:50,495
Hi.

652
00:52:50,594 --> 00:52:51,903
Nick.

653
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:53,857
Open it.

654
00:53:00,386 --> 00:53:01,596
You like it?

655
00:53:01,698 --> 00:53:03,225
Yeah. It's beautiful.

656
00:53:03,330 --> 00:53:05,883
LYDlA: Hello!

657
00:53:05,986 --> 00:53:09,302
Oh, I want you to meet
the young Indian architect

658
00:53:09,410 --> 00:53:10,904
who has so captured Maxine's heart.

659
00:53:11,010 --> 00:53:11,938
Oh.

660
00:53:12,034 --> 00:53:14,008
This is Pam Burton,
a dear college friend,

661
00:53:14,114 --> 00:53:16,481
and this is Nikhil Ganguli.
How do you do?

662
00:53:16,578 --> 00:53:17,592
Maxine, look who's here.

663
00:53:17,698 --> 00:53:20,632
It's very nice to meet you.

664
00:53:20,738 --> 00:53:22,167
You, as well.

665
00:53:22,274 --> 00:53:24,379
Now, how old were you
when you moved to America?

666
00:53:24,482 --> 00:53:26,140
I was actually born in New York.
I'm from here.

667
00:53:26,242 --> 00:53:28,663
I once had a girlfriend
who went to India.

668
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:31,104
Came back thin as a rail.

669
00:53:31,202 --> 00:53:32,314
I'm sure.

670
00:53:32,418 --> 00:53:34,174
I was horribly envious of her!

671
00:53:37,922 --> 00:53:40,508
Don't your parents want you
to marry a nice Indian girl?

672
00:53:41,506 --> 00:53:43,361
I don't care what they want.

673
00:53:46,338 --> 00:53:48,192
This is what I want.

674
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:04,055
Nick, Nick, Nick, Nick,

675
00:54:04,162 --> 00:54:05,689
Nick, Nick, Nick,
Nick, Nick, Nick...

676
00:54:08,513 --> 00:54:09,975
ASHl MA:
Sally gave them to me

677
00:54:10,081 --> 00:54:12,700
before anybody else
could check them out, huh?

678
00:54:12,802 --> 00:54:16,185
Ah. Reading Chekhov.

679
00:54:16,290 --> 00:54:20,185
What perks I get
from my wife, the librarian.

680
00:54:20,289 --> 00:54:21,238
Mmm.

681
00:54:22,722 --> 00:54:24,128
MAN: What, are you blind?

682
00:54:24,226 --> 00:54:26,048
MAN: Today, huh?

683
00:54:26,146 --> 00:54:27,553
Uh...

684
00:54:27,650 --> 00:54:30,432
WOMAN: Hey!
MAN: Lady, get out of the way!

685
00:54:32,034 --> 00:54:33,725
You have to learn to drive faster.

686
00:54:33,826 --> 00:54:35,550
Don't talk to me.

687
00:54:35,649 --> 00:54:38,333
I will have an accident, huh?

688
00:54:38,434 --> 00:54:40,921
If you keep on driving like this,
you will have an accident.

689
00:54:52,162 --> 00:54:55,228
Everything's fine, Mom.

690
00:54:55,330 --> 00:54:56,791
Mom, why are you calling me?
Hey, hon.

691
00:54:56,898 --> 00:54:58,807
ASHl MA: Because you're not
at your apartment.

692
00:54:58,914 --> 00:54:59,862
Shh, whoa.

693
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:02,337
You are never
at your apartment, Gogol.

694
00:55:02,434 --> 00:55:03,611
In the middle
of the night,

695
00:55:03,714 --> 00:55:05,536
I have called and you are not there.

696
00:55:05,634 --> 00:55:06,561
I am, Ma.

697
00:55:06,658 --> 00:55:07,454
I need my sleep.

698
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,692
I turn off the phone.

699
00:55:09,794 --> 00:55:10,722
Ooh.

700
00:55:10,817 --> 00:55:11,832
Gogol, are you there?

701
00:55:11,938 --> 00:55:13,596
Yeah, yeah, I'm here, I'm here.

702
00:55:13,697 --> 00:55:16,064
I want you to come
home next Saturday.

703
00:55:16,162 --> 00:55:17,111
Then you can
come with us

704
00:55:17,218 --> 00:55:19,007
to the airport the next day.

705
00:55:19,105 --> 00:55:20,316
Baba is going to teach in Ohio

706
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:21,399
for six months.

707
00:55:21,506 --> 00:55:22,586
You remember or not?

708
00:55:22,689 --> 00:55:24,348
Yeah, I remember, Mom,
but what's the big deal?

709
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:25,824
He's only going to Cleveland.

710
00:55:25,921 --> 00:55:27,034
Sonia's not coming home.

711
00:55:27,137 --> 00:55:29,079
Sonia lives in California, Gogol.

712
00:55:30,977 --> 00:55:32,865
: Mom, I can't come
home that weekend.

713
00:55:32,962 --> 00:55:34,718
I'm going on a vacation
with my girlfriend.

714
00:55:34,817 --> 00:55:37,752
Her parents have a place
in Oyster Bay.

715
00:55:40,802 --> 00:55:42,657
Mom?

716
00:55:52,834 --> 00:55:54,525
Would you mind if we went
to go see my parents

717
00:55:54,625 --> 00:55:55,738
on the way to Oyster Bay?

718
00:55:55,841 --> 00:55:57,118
You mean I'd finally
get to meet them?

719
00:55:57,218 --> 00:55:58,232
Mm-hmm.

720
00:55:58,338 --> 00:55:59,680
I'd love to, baby.

721
00:55:59,777 --> 00:56:01,665
: Oh, that's too much.

722
00:56:04,577 --> 00:56:06,999
I'm back...

723
00:56:09,666 --> 00:56:11,553
You know, he is willing
to go on vacation

724
00:56:11,649 --> 00:56:14,071
with someone
else's parents,

725
00:56:14,177 --> 00:56:15,933
but not to see his own.

726
00:56:16,034 --> 00:56:18,303
Oh, forget it, this is America.

727
00:56:18,402 --> 00:56:21,501
As soon as the kids turn 16,
they're gone.

728
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:25,177
I lost the company
of my parents

729
00:56:25,282 --> 00:56:29,559
when I first came to this country.

730
00:56:29,666 --> 00:56:33,889
Now I feel I'm losing my
family all over again.

731
00:56:33,985 --> 00:56:38,492
Besides, what kind of a
girl is called Max, huh?

732
00:56:38,594 --> 00:56:40,601
Maybe it's a boy.

733
00:56:42,498 --> 00:56:44,570
There are some things
you should know.

734
00:56:44,674 --> 00:56:46,529
Um, no kissing, no holding hands.

735
00:56:46,626 --> 00:56:48,054
My parents are not Lydia and Gerald.

736
00:56:48,162 --> 00:56:50,202
I've never seen them touch,
let alone anything else.

737
00:56:50,305 --> 00:56:51,233
A little depressing.

738
00:56:51,330 --> 00:56:52,540
Ah, a little bit.

739
00:56:52,642 --> 00:56:55,937
You know, you really don't
have to get all this stuff.

740
00:56:56,034 --> 00:56:57,594
Come on,
why are you getting truffles?

741
00:56:57,698 --> 00:56:59,039
God, they won't like
them, will they?

742
00:56:59,138 --> 00:57:00,032
: No.

743
00:57:00,130 --> 00:57:02,683
Come on, Nick, everyone
loves truffles.

744
00:57:03,810 --> 00:57:05,882
GOGOL: Ma, we're here.

745
00:57:05,986 --> 00:57:08,986
Ma.

746
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:11,032
Hi.

747
00:57:11,138 --> 00:57:12,065
Ma, this is Maxine.

748
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:13,209
Max, this is my mother.

749
00:57:13,314 --> 00:57:14,208
Hello, Ashima.

750
00:57:14,305 --> 00:57:17,818
It's so nice to finally meet you.

751
00:57:17,922 --> 00:57:19,613
Mm.

752
00:57:19,713 --> 00:57:21,623
These are for you and Ashoke.

753
00:57:21,729 --> 00:57:22,678
Oh.

754
00:57:22,786 --> 00:57:25,088
There was no need.

755
00:57:25,186 --> 00:57:26,047
Thank you.

756
00:57:26,146 --> 00:57:26,876
Please come in.

757
00:57:26,978 --> 00:57:28,920
Come.
Thank you.

758
00:57:32,289 --> 00:57:33,751
Please sit.

759
00:57:35,650 --> 00:57:37,406
I will get drinks.

760
00:57:38,817 --> 00:57:39,745
It's nice.
Thank you.

761
00:57:39,842 --> 00:57:41,052
This is where you grew up, huh?

762
00:57:41,154 --> 00:57:42,168
Yeah.

763
00:57:54,625 --> 00:57:56,251
Thank you.
Nikhil's father is upstairs

764
00:57:56,353 --> 00:57:59,485
with the man from the alarm company.

765
00:57:59,585 --> 00:58:01,724
Why on Earth are you getting
a security system?

766
00:58:01,826 --> 00:58:04,760
It was your father's idea,
now that I will be on my own.

767
00:58:04,866 --> 00:58:07,517
You know,
even in good areas like this,

768
00:58:07,617 --> 00:58:09,178
these days there are crimes.

769
00:58:09,281 --> 00:58:10,296
Ashima,

770
00:58:10,402 --> 00:58:11,962
I've been admiring
what you're wearing.

771
00:58:12,065 --> 00:58:12,796
Is this,

772
00:58:12,898 --> 00:58:14,425
uh, a kanta?

773
00:58:14,529 --> 00:58:16,253
: Oh, yes.

774
00:58:16,353 --> 00:58:17,368
I grew up with fabrics.

775
00:58:17,473 --> 00:58:19,481
My mother curates textiles
at the Met.

776
00:58:19,585 --> 00:58:21,276
The Met?

777
00:58:21,378 --> 00:58:22,654
The Metropolitan Museum of Art.

778
00:58:22,754 --> 00:58:24,161
You remember, Ma, I took you there.

779
00:58:24,258 --> 00:58:27,258
It's the museum with all the
steps and the Egyptian temple.

780
00:58:27,361 --> 00:58:29,783
Uh-huh, I remember.

781
00:58:29,889 --> 00:58:32,224
My father was also an artist.

782
00:58:32,321 --> 00:58:34,460
That painting you're seeing there...

783
00:58:34,562 --> 00:58:36,929
that is his painting.

784
00:58:37,025 --> 00:58:38,586
Oh, it's nice.

785
00:58:38,689 --> 00:58:39,933
MAN: We're all set, Mr. Ganguli.

786
00:58:40,034 --> 00:58:42,783
ASHOKE: So it'll be installed
tomorrow, all right?

787
00:58:42,881 --> 00:58:44,769
Uh-huh.

788
00:58:44,866 --> 00:58:45,880
Let me give you a receipt.

789
00:58:45,986 --> 00:58:47,644
Hmm, it's really lovely.

790
00:58:47,746 --> 00:58:50,528
Thank you, Mr. Odin.

791
00:58:52,962 --> 00:58:54,587
GOGOL: Hey, Baba.

792
00:58:54,690 --> 00:58:55,486
Hi.

793
00:58:55,586 --> 00:58:56,633
This is Maxine.

794
00:58:56,738 --> 00:58:58,526
Max, this is my father.

795
00:58:58,626 --> 00:59:00,087
Hello.
Hello, Ashoke.

796
00:59:06,306 --> 00:59:07,037
How are you?

797
00:59:07,137 --> 00:59:08,926
Fine.

798
00:59:09,026 --> 00:59:10,552
Fine.

799
00:59:14,978 --> 00:59:16,636
Hmm.

800
00:59:16,737 --> 00:59:19,966
This is the best Indian
food I've ever tasted.

801
00:59:22,081 --> 00:59:24,088
Nikhil's mother has been cooking
for the past two days.

802
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:27,933
It's better
than this boy here makes.

803
00:59:31,681 --> 00:59:33,918
ASHOKE: Oh...

804
00:59:35,106 --> 00:59:37,594
I forgot the ice cream.

805
00:59:42,082 --> 00:59:44,253
Nikhil, come with me
to Breyer's, would you?

806
00:59:44,354 --> 00:59:45,881
Sure.

807
00:59:46,945 --> 00:59:48,319
I'll come with you.

808
00:59:48,417 --> 00:59:50,392
Why don't you stay here and
keep Nikhil's mother company?

809
00:59:50,497 --> 00:59:52,407
We'll be back in no time.

810
00:59:52,513 --> 00:59:53,888
Yes?
Okay.

811
00:59:59,458 --> 01:00:01,345
ASHOKE:
I wanted to tell you something before I leave

812
01:00:01,441 --> 01:00:04,027
for my semester in Ohio.

813
01:00:05,026 --> 01:00:07,546
It is about your name.

814
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:08,926
My name?

815
01:00:09,025 --> 01:00:11,873
Yeah, Gogol.

816
01:00:11,969 --> 01:00:14,358
There is a reason for it, you know.

817
01:00:14,466 --> 01:00:15,327
I know.

818
01:00:15,426 --> 01:00:16,506
Gogol's your favorite author.

819
01:00:16,609 --> 01:00:17,886
I remember.

820
01:00:19,041 --> 01:00:21,213
It is more than that.

821
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:24,377
It was, uh...

822
01:00:25,474 --> 01:00:29,598
1974 when I was a
student in Calcutta.

823
01:00:31,713 --> 01:00:33,753
Every year I would take
the train to visit

824
01:00:33,858 --> 01:00:36,378
my grandfather in Dungarpur.

825
01:00:39,297 --> 01:00:42,974
I carried one book with me
to read on thejourney.

826
01:00:44,130 --> 01:00:45,918
Gogol?

827
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:49,498
Yes, The Overcoat.

828
01:00:50,498 --> 01:00:54,011
So, in the train late at night,

829
01:00:54,113 --> 01:00:56,088
a Mr. Ghosh befriended me.

830
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:58,528
He kept trying to persuade me
to leave India...

831
01:00:58,626 --> 01:01:00,000
...I was in England for two years...

832
01:01:00,098 --> 01:01:04,473
...and I just wanted
to get back to my book.

833
01:01:04,578 --> 01:01:08,440
My grandfather always says
that is what books are for:

834
01:01:08,545 --> 01:01:11,611
to travel without moving an inch.

835
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:16,603
And that's when it happened.

836
01:01:47,393 --> 01:01:48,800
Find anybody?

837
01:01:53,121 --> 01:01:56,733
§ §

838
01:02:10,241 --> 01:02:12,510
Nothing here, keep going.

839
01:02:15,041 --> 01:02:16,318
Found anybody?

840
01:02:17,346 --> 01:02:18,458
No survivors.

841
01:02:18,562 --> 01:02:20,253
Look-- the man holding the book!

842
01:02:20,353 --> 01:02:21,979
He's moving. Come quickly!

843
01:02:36,642 --> 01:02:40,319
ASHOKE:
I kept hearing Ghosh's voice in my head.

844
01:02:40,417 --> 01:02:43,068
GHOSH: Pack a pillow and blanket.

845
01:02:43,170 --> 01:02:44,926
See the world.

846
01:02:45,025 --> 01:02:47,414
You will never regret it.

847
01:02:53,665 --> 01:02:57,789
That is how I came to America
and you got your name.

848
01:03:04,994 --> 01:03:05,921
Come.

849
01:03:06,017 --> 01:03:09,246
Maxine will be waiting for you.

850
01:03:16,193 --> 01:03:18,779
Baba, is that what you think of
when you think of me?

851
01:03:21,345 --> 01:03:24,641
Do I remind you of that night?

852
01:03:27,586 --> 01:03:30,237
Not at all.

853
01:03:30,337 --> 01:03:35,039
You remind me of everything
that followed.

854
01:03:35,137 --> 01:03:39,839
Every day since then has been
a gift...

855
01:03:39,937 --> 01:03:41,693
Gogol.

856
01:03:57,985 --> 01:03:59,163
Samosas for the journey.

857
01:03:59,266 --> 01:04:00,127
Thank you.

858
01:04:00,226 --> 01:04:02,168
Thank you for lunch.

859
01:04:02,273 --> 01:04:03,648
It was lovely to meet you.
Bye.

860
01:04:03,745 --> 01:04:05,174
Bye, Ma.

861
01:04:05,281 --> 01:04:08,096
Same here.

862
01:04:08,193 --> 01:04:11,161
Remember to check in
on your mother now and again.

863
01:04:11,265 --> 01:04:12,378
Okay, Baba.

864
01:04:12,481 --> 01:04:14,620
And call to let us know
that you arrived safely.

865
01:04:14,722 --> 01:04:15,649
I will.

866
01:04:15,745 --> 01:04:17,272
ASHOKE: Drive safely, Gogol.

867
01:04:20,961 --> 01:04:22,270
What did your dad just call you?

868
01:04:22,369 --> 01:04:25,500
I'll explain later.

869
01:04:29,601 --> 01:04:33,278
MAXl NE: I'd never have guessed
they're your parents. You're so different.

870
01:04:46,241 --> 01:04:47,518
Oh, we're here.

871
01:04:47,618 --> 01:04:49,505
This is beautiful.

872
01:04:49,601 --> 01:04:50,845
You like?
Yeah.

873
01:04:50,946 --> 01:04:53,084
It's a perfect example
of New England Victorian.

874
01:04:53,185 --> 01:04:55,552
Thus spake my architect.

875
01:04:55,650 --> 01:04:57,057
We got truffles!

876
01:04:57,153 --> 01:04:59,095
GOGOL: Hey, Gerald. Hey, Lydia.

877
01:04:59,201 --> 01:05:00,216
Hey!

878
01:05:00,321 --> 01:05:02,590
Hi, Boomer! Hi!

879
01:05:02,689 --> 01:05:03,420
GERALD: Hi, Nick.

880
01:05:06,593 --> 01:05:09,495
MAXl NE:
This is my absolute favorite place on Earth.

881
01:05:09,601 --> 01:05:11,030
I can map my life here.

882
01:05:14,273 --> 01:05:16,728
You know, I envy you this place.

883
01:05:16,833 --> 01:05:20,062
My parents never felt the need
to be so far away from things.

884
01:05:20,161 --> 01:05:22,266
Where did you guys go?

885
01:05:22,369 --> 01:05:23,613
On the road.

886
01:05:23,713 --> 01:05:26,560
In rented vans, we would
travel with Bengali families

887
01:05:26,657 --> 01:05:28,086
to see other
Bengali families,

888
01:05:28,193 --> 01:05:30,015
inevitably getting
lost along the way.

889
01:05:30,113 --> 01:05:32,960
Dads mulling over AAA maps
on the side of the road.

890
01:05:33,057 --> 01:05:35,261
And when it was time to eat,
we would pull over again

891
01:05:35,362 --> 01:05:37,947
at some rest stop and pull
out a nine-course Indian meal

892
01:05:38,049 --> 01:05:39,772
from a bunch of tiffins
when all I really wanted

893
01:05:39,873 --> 01:05:41,215
was McDonald's to begin with.

894
01:05:41,313 --> 01:05:42,775
It was kind of fun,
though, you know,

895
01:05:42,881 --> 01:05:44,223
if you didn't know anything else.

896
01:05:44,321 --> 01:05:45,019
Mm...

897
01:05:46,305 --> 01:05:48,542
Well, you're here now.

898
01:05:48,641 --> 01:05:51,511
Mm...

899
01:05:51,617 --> 01:05:53,919
So, Ms. Maxine Emma Faye,
what's it gonna be?

900
01:05:54,017 --> 01:05:57,181
The museum job or
the book on Montagna?

901
01:05:59,649 --> 01:06:01,405
I don't want to think
about it right now.

902
01:06:02,977 --> 01:06:04,635
I want to be free!

903
01:06:10,241 --> 01:06:12,729
He never called.

904
01:06:12,833 --> 01:06:14,688
I'm sure they're fine.

905
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:18,458
Hmm.

906
01:06:18,561 --> 01:06:20,896
It is you I am worried about.

907
01:06:20,993 --> 01:06:22,902
You know, being alone...

908
01:06:23,010 --> 01:06:25,279
for the first time.

909
01:06:25,377 --> 01:06:27,865
No big deal...

910
01:06:27,969 --> 01:06:30,838
as the children always say to me.

911
01:06:36,513 --> 01:06:39,328
It is easy for them, Ashima.

912
01:06:39,425 --> 01:06:42,524
They grew up here.

913
01:06:45,505 --> 01:06:48,374
You will be alone, too.

914
01:06:48,481 --> 01:06:50,455
How will you manage?

915
01:06:53,313 --> 01:06:56,215
But I will see you
every third weekend.

916
01:07:10,625 --> 01:07:14,170
I wish you would change
your mind and come with me.

917
01:07:19,425 --> 01:07:21,465
Hmm?

918
01:07:26,785 --> 01:07:28,061
Come.

919
01:07:44,673 --> 01:07:47,607
§ §

920
01:08:02,817 --> 01:08:04,704
§ §

921
01:08:39,457 --> 01:08:42,839
TELEPHONE OPERATOR:
That was Radcliff?

922
01:08:42,945 --> 01:08:46,174
I do have a number for a
G. Radcliff in Oyster Bay.

01:08:46,273 --> 01:08:48,411
But I'm afraid it's unlisted.

924
01:08:54,785 --> 01:08:57,174
Happy Birthday, Gogol.

925
01:08:58,529 --> 01:08:59,423
Happy Birthday, Nick.

926
01:08:59,521 --> 01:09:00,536
Thank you.
Ooh!

927
01:09:00,641 --> 01:09:02,135
Make a wish.

928
01:09:02,241 --> 01:09:03,866
LYDlA: Yea!

929
01:09:03,969 --> 01:09:06,358
Thanks, you guys.
This is really nice.

930
01:09:24,801 --> 01:09:27,452

932
01:10:02,752 --> 01:10:04,094
Hello?

ASHOKE: Hello, Ashima?

934
01:10:05,441 --> 01:10:06,368
Hey.

935
01:10:06,465 --> 01:10:08,221
I was just thinking about you.

936
01:10:08,321 --> 01:10:12,150
The shrubs the children planted
need to be pruned.

937
01:10:13,568 --> 01:10:16,416
Ashima, I'm in Cleveland General Hospital.

938
01:10:18,720 --> 01:10:20,379
What happened?

939
01:10:20,481 --> 01:10:23,198
I don't know. My stomach's been
bothering me since morning, and I was...

940
01:10:23,297 --> 01:10:26,875
invited by some Bengali
students for dinner.

941
01:10:26,977 --> 01:10:28,799
Take an Alka-Seltzer?

942
01:10:28,897 --> 01:10:32,061
I did.
It didn't help.

943
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:34,844
I came to the emergency
room because, uh...

944
01:10:34,945 --> 01:10:36,984
all the doctors' offices are
closed today.

945
01:10:37,089 --> 01:10:38,944
So who drove you there?

946
01:10:39,041 --> 01:10:42,008
No one. I am here on my own.

947
01:10:42,112 --> 01:10:43,901
I, uh...

948
01:10:44,001 --> 01:10:45,888
Really, it's not that bad.

949
01:10:47,297 --> 01:10:48,955
I wish I had come with you.

950
01:10:49,057 --> 01:10:50,715
I was also so selfish--

951
01:10:50,817 --> 01:10:52,410
only thinking about myself.

952
01:10:52,513 --> 01:10:54,847
Ashima...

953
01:10:54,945 --> 01:10:57,563
Don't worry. It is nothing.

954
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:01,244
Ashoke, what does the doctor say?

955
01:11:03,201 --> 01:11:05,502
I'm waiting to see him.
There's a long line.

956
01:11:05,601 --> 01:11:06,976
Very long line.

957
01:11:09,185 --> 01:11:10,298
And don't worry.

958
01:11:10,401 --> 01:11:12,223
Hmm.

959
01:11:12,321 --> 01:11:13,848
I am feeling better already.

960
01:11:13,953 --> 01:11:15,611
Huh?

961
01:11:15,712 --> 01:11:17,403
All right.

962
01:11:17,505 --> 01:11:18,301
Ashima...

963
01:11:18,401 --> 01:11:19,830
I'll call you when I get home.

964
01:11:19,937 --> 01:11:21,944
Okay.

965
01:11:54,785 --> 01:11:57,174

This is Professor Ganguli.

"l" for India.

975
01:12:22,881 --> 01:12:25,531
I have already spelled
my name five times.

have to put you on hold, ma'am.

To whom am I speaking?

Ashima Ganguli.

979
01:12:38,753 --> 01:12:41,054
Ashoke Ganguli's wife.
Who I am speaking to?

980
01:12:41,152 --> 01:12:42,265
I'm sorry, ma'am.

981
01:12:42,368 --> 01:12:45,183
I'm the intern who first
examined your husband.

982
01:12:45,281 --> 01:12:47,670
I have been holding on
for half an hour.

983
01:12:47,776 --> 01:12:50,264
Is my husband still there,
or has he gone?

984
01:12:50,369 --> 01:12:52,059
He said he will phone me.

985
01:12:52,161 --> 01:12:55,031
I'm very sorry, ma'am.
We've been trying to reach you.

The patient, your husband...

Ashoke Ganguli,
passed away at 5:35 p.m.

Hello?

989
01:13:06,657 --> 01:13:09,275
It is a mistake.

990
01:13:09,377 --> 01:13:11,417
He was not there for emergency.

991
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:13,430
Only for stomachache.

992
01:13:13,537 --> 01:13:15,741
Your husband had a massive
heart attack.

993
01:13:15,841 --> 01:13:18,296
All attempts to revive him failed.

994
01:13:18,400 --> 01:13:20,124
Is there anyone

995
01:13:20,225 --> 01:13:23,520

identify and claim the body?

I don't know.

1090
01:25:36,175 --> 01:25:39,404
That is not the point, Gogol.

1091
01:25:39,502 --> 01:25:42,404
The point is that now you should
move on with your life.

1092
01:25:44,527 --> 01:25:45,988
You know,

1093
01:25:46,095 --> 01:25:47,917

1094

my tenth wedding anniversary.

01:26:09,327 --> 01:26:11,115
don't sound funny to other people?

1105
01:26:11,214 --> 01:26:13,189
Poor thing.

1106
01:26:13,294 --> 01:26:15,149
Terrible, terrible tragedy.

1107
01:26:15,247 --> 01:26:17,385
You know, she was supposed
to have been married.

1108
01:26:17,486 --> 01:26:20,104
But it was canceled
at the last minute.

1109
01:26:20,206 --> 01:26:22,508
The invitation cards were sent out.

1110
01:26:22,606 --> 01:26:24,199
The hall was booked, even.

1111
01:26:24,302 --> 01:26:26,342
She's also in
New York-- alone--

1112
01:26:26,446 --> 01:26:28,716
doing her PhD.

1113
01:26:28,814 --> 01:26:30,756
I told her parents,

1114
01:26:30,862 --> 01:26:33,131
"Don't worry, Gogol is also
there. He will call her."

1115
01:26:33,231 --> 01:26:35,467
Hey, hey, hey, Ma!

1116
01:26:35,566 --> 01:26:39,112
You don't have time for
one cup of tea, Gogol?

1117
01:26:39,214 --> 01:26:41,767
Her parents came to
Baba's funeral, also.

1118
01:26:41,871 --> 01:26:43,464
This is the least we can do.

1119
01:26:43,566 --> 01:26:45,028
Okay, look, time out.

1120
01:26:45,134 --> 01:26:47,142
Let's say

1121
01:26:47,246 --> 01:26:48,904
that I take her out to tea, okay?

1122
01:26:49,006 --> 01:26:50,664
Then what? What are we going
to talk about?

1123
01:26:50,767 --> 01:26:52,622
As far as I recall,
she doesn't even speak.

1124
01:26:52,718 --> 01:26:54,279
Only reads.
Weird French stuff, Ma.

1125
01:26:54,382 --> 01:26:55,244
Bye, Ma.

1126
01:26:55,342 --> 01:26:57,317
Later, Goggles.
See you later.

1127
01:27:03,502 --> 01:27:05,029
This is her number.

1128
01:27:05,134 --> 01:27:06,989
Ma...
Call her if you want.

1129
01:27:07,087 --> 01:27:08,942
Don't call her if you don't want.

1130
01:27:09,038 --> 01:27:10,118
Yeah.

1131
01:27:10,222 --> 01:27:11,683
Okay.

1132
01:27:11,790 --> 01:27:13,197
Thank you.

1133
01:27:17,454 --> 01:27:20,323
Nikhil.

1134
01:27:20,430 --> 01:27:22,819
Yes.

1135
01:27:22,926 --> 01:27:24,901
As opposed to Gogol?

1136
01:27:25,006 --> 01:27:27,527
Yes.

1137
01:27:28,686 --> 01:27:29,864
Excuse me.
Yeah?

1138
01:27:29,967 --> 01:27:31,210
Single malt, please. Thanks.
Okay.

1139
01:27:31,310 --> 01:27:32,423
WAlTER: Single malt.

1140
01:27:33,807 --> 01:27:35,465
I've never done this before.

1141
01:27:35,566 --> 01:27:37,541
What's that?

1142
01:27:37,647 --> 01:27:40,646
Gone out on a blind date
engineered by my mom.

1143
01:27:40,750 --> 01:27:42,124
It's not a blind date exactly.

1144
01:27:42,222 --> 01:27:43,913
No?

1145
01:27:44,015 --> 01:27:44,997
No, we sort of

1146
01:27:45,102 --> 01:27:46,509
know each other, in a way.

1147
01:27:46,606 --> 01:27:47,588
Here you go.

1148
01:27:47,694 --> 01:27:49,800
I don't remember our
ever talking, really.

1149
01:27:51,951 --> 01:27:54,285
Actually, neither do I.

1150
01:27:57,199 --> 01:28:00,232
Does your family still live in
the same house I used to visit?

1151
01:28:00,335 --> 01:28:02,244
Yeah.

1152
01:28:02,350 --> 01:28:04,717
I remember the kitchen.

1153
01:28:04,814 --> 01:28:08,426
It had these very blue cupboards.

1154
01:28:08,527 --> 01:28:11,210
Yeah, those are still there.

1155
01:28:18,446 --> 01:28:20,585
I was sorry to hear
about your father.

1156
01:28:20,686 --> 01:28:22,509
Oh.

1157
01:28:22,606 --> 01:28:24,199
How's your mother getting along?

1158
01:28:24,302 --> 01:28:25,480
She's all right.

1159
01:28:25,582 --> 01:28:28,168
You know, Sonia's been living
with her, so that helps.

1160
01:28:34,126 --> 01:28:35,981
So why'd you leave Paris
for New York?

1161
01:28:36,078 --> 01:28:37,987
Wouldn't you rather study
French literature in France?

1162
01:28:38,094 --> 01:28:39,981
I moved here for love.

1163
01:28:41,134 --> 01:28:43,817
Surely you know about my
prenuptial disaster.

1164
01:28:43,918 --> 01:28:45,445
Not really.

1165
01:28:45,550 --> 01:28:46,663
Well, you ought to.

1166
01:28:46,767 --> 01:28:49,800
Every other Bengali living
on the East Coast does.

1167
01:28:52,878 --> 01:28:55,115
So, uh...

1168
01:28:55,215 --> 01:28:56,971
should we make
our mothers happy

1169
01:28:57,070 --> 01:28:58,347
and see each other again?

1170
01:28:58,447 --> 01:28:59,374
Maybe.

1171
01:28:59,470 --> 01:29:01,542
Give me a call.

1172
01:29:01,646 --> 01:29:02,726
Okay.

1173
01:29:20,527 --> 01:29:22,948
I know why he went to Cleveland.

1174
01:29:25,390 --> 01:29:28,325
He was teaching me how
to live alone.

1175
01:29:48,367 --> 01:29:50,123
MOUSHUMl:
So of course, my mother is

1176
01:29:50,222 --> 01:29:53,222
appalled that I'm not cooking
you Indian food.

1177
01:29:53,326 --> 01:29:55,464
You told her I was coming over?

1178
01:29:55,566 --> 01:29:56,940
She called today.

1179
01:29:57,038 --> 01:30:00,038
What about you? Have you been
giving your mother updates?

1180
01:30:00,142 --> 01:30:01,352
Sort of.

1181
01:30:02,606 --> 01:30:04,712
Oh, God! I need to add more liquid.

1182
01:30:08,334 --> 01:30:10,090
Are you all right?

1183
01:30:10,191 --> 01:30:11,565
God. Um...

1184
01:30:11,662 --> 01:30:13,866
Yeah, um, could you
please help me

1185
01:30:13,966 --> 01:30:16,006
with my glasses?
Get them off for me.

1186
01:30:35,470 --> 01:30:38,405
§ §

1187
01:30:39,534 --> 01:30:42,055
God, did I really say that?

1188
01:30:42,158 --> 01:30:43,652
You sure as hell did.

1189
01:30:44,846 --> 01:30:46,788
No wonder you never
talked to me back then.

1190
01:30:46,894 --> 01:30:48,236
Hey, I tried.

1191
01:30:48,334 --> 01:30:50,985
You were the one who used
to treat me like an untouchable.

1192
01:30:53,422 --> 01:30:55,048
How'd you get so sexy?

1193
01:30:56,046 --> 01:30:58,021
Paris.

1194
01:30:58,126 --> 01:31:00,101
Paris.

1195
01:31:02,606 --> 01:31:06,381
After years of convincing myself
I'd never have a lover...

1196
01:31:07,822 --> 01:31:10,440
...I began to have affairs.

1197
01:31:10,542 --> 01:31:12,811
How many?

1198
01:31:17,582 --> 01:31:19,143
How many what?

1199
01:31:19,246 --> 01:31:21,068
Lovers.

1200
01:31:23,694 --> 01:31:25,799
You don't want to know.

1201
01:31:33,646 --> 01:31:36,068
MAN:
But you must understand

1202
01:31:36,174 --> 01:31:38,662
that without fire,
this entire ceremony's invalid.

1203
01:31:38,766 --> 01:31:39,879
I'm sorry, sir.

1204
01:31:39,982 --> 01:31:41,575
I cannot allow you
to light a fire

1205
01:31:41,678 --> 01:31:44,012
anywhere within the hotel premises.

1206
01:32:17,358 --> 01:32:22,955
§ §

1207
01:32:23,054 --> 01:32:24,483
ASHl MA: I wandered...

1208
01:32:24,590 --> 01:32:26,794
lonely as a cloud

1209
01:32:26,894 --> 01:32:30,604
That floats on high
o'er vales and hills

1210
01:32:30,702 --> 01:32:32,109
When all at once

1211
01:32:32,206 --> 01:32:33,319
I saw a crowd

1212
01:32:33,422 --> 01:32:36,270
A host of golden daffodils.

1213
01:32:39,406 --> 01:32:41,707
You're next, Sonia. Beauty!

1214

§ §

1215
01:33:40,782 --> 01:33:42,124
Mm, mm, mm, mm, mm.

1216
01:33:42,222 --> 01:33:43,083
Mmm-hm, mm-hmm.

1217
01:33:43,182 --> 01:33:45,549
Mmm? Ah.
Hmm.

1218
01:33:45,646 --> 01:33:47,718
Hmm?

1219
01:33:50,158 --> 01:33:51,946
§ §

1220
01:34:16,046 --> 01:34:17,704
Mmm!

1221
01:34:41,102 --> 01:34:43,720
$101 from the Banagi family.

1222
01:34:43,822 --> 01:34:46,342
All right.
That brings the total...

1223
01:34:47,566 --> 01:34:49,933
...to $7,035.

1224
01:34:50,030 --> 01:34:51,721
:
Not bad, Mr. Ganguli.

1225
01:34:51,822 --> 01:34:53,993
:
I'd say we made a killing, Mrs. Ganguli.

1226
01:34:54,094 --> 01:34:56,167
Oh, hold it, hold it.

1227
01:34:56,270 --> 01:34:58,092
Ms. Mazumdar's the name.

1228
01:35:03,405 --> 01:35:06,504
We've already discussed this.

1229
01:35:06,606 --> 01:35:09,061
Yeah, but I thought, you know,
both names.

1230
01:35:10,221 --> 01:35:12,196
Do you know how many
letters that is?

1231
01:35:12,302 --> 01:35:15,236
lmagine spelling
that over the phone.

1232
01:35:18,126 --> 01:35:20,711
I've begun to publish under my name.

1233
01:35:20,814 --> 01:35:22,570
No one would know me.

1234
01:35:26,510 --> 01:35:28,201
Oh, come on, Nikhil.

1235
01:35:29,933 --> 01:35:31,275
What if somebody asked you to

1236
01:35:31,374 --> 01:35:34,243
change your name?

1237
01:35:34,350 --> 01:35:37,001
I already have, remember?

1238
01:35:38,606 --> 01:35:42,184
Forget it, I was just
being silly, Ms. Mazumdar.

1239
01:35:46,894 --> 01:35:48,585
GOGOL: But it's our anniversary.

1240
01:35:48,686 --> 01:35:50,922
MOUSHUMl: So, we'll celebrate.
Wish we didn't have to go.

1241
01:35:51,022 --> 01:35:53,443
Tonight of all nights.
We promised.

1242
01:35:53,550 --> 01:35:55,786
No, no, no, no. We didn't
promise. You promised.

1243
01:35:56,782 --> 01:35:58,440
I bought your gift.
Mmm-hmm.

1244
01:35:58,542 --> 01:36:01,160
Have you bought mine?
I'm not buying it, I'm making it.

1245
01:36:01,261 --> 01:36:03,563
I'm designing a dream house
for you, Ms. Mazumdar.

1246
01:36:03,662 --> 01:36:05,517
So you're just gonna have to wait.

1247
01:36:08,110 --> 01:36:09,833
So, we're thinking Prescott.

1248
01:36:09,934 --> 01:36:12,422
I'm sorry? Prescott? Why?
Prescott?

1249
01:36:12,525 --> 01:36:13,638
It's a family name.

1250
01:36:13,741 --> 01:36:15,564
What does it mean?
The name should mean something.

1251
01:36:15,661 --> 01:36:17,123
Where have you been?

1252
01:36:17,230 --> 01:36:18,756
Just keeping Donald company.

1253
01:36:20,461 --> 01:36:22,436
What does Moushumi mean?

1254
01:36:22,542 --> 01:36:24,843
A damp, southwesterly breeze.

1255
01:36:24,942 --> 01:36:26,633
Well, stop worrying.

1256
01:36:26,734 --> 01:36:29,384
If he doesn't like his name,
he can always change it.

1257
01:36:29,486 --> 01:36:32,039
I'd never change my name.
It's my grandmother's.

1258
01:36:32,142 --> 01:36:33,702
Nikhil changed his.

1259
01:36:33,806 --> 01:36:35,628
Really?

1260
01:36:35,726 --> 01:36:37,220
What do you mean,
he changed his name?

1261
01:36:37,326 --> 01:36:40,108
Nikhil, it wasn't the name
he was born with.

1262
01:36:40,206 --> 01:36:41,733
Well, what name were you born with?

1263
01:36:43,726 --> 01:36:45,798
Gogol.

1264
01:36:48,014 --> 01:36:49,956
As in The Overcoat?
Yes.

1265
01:36:50,061 --> 01:36:52,363
Ah, I get it.

1266
01:36:52,462 --> 01:36:54,349
Nikolai Gogol.

1267
01:36:54,446 --> 01:36:56,999
Exactly.
What in the world made

1268
01:36:57,102 --> 01:36:58,181
your parents choose that name?

1269
01:37:00,302 --> 01:37:02,723
My father was a fan.

1270
01:37:27,982 --> 01:37:31,298
What I told you about
my name was personal.

1271
01:37:31,405 --> 01:37:34,253
: Nobody cares.

1272
01:37:34,350 --> 01:37:36,008
It's not just some joke
or conversation piece, okay?

1273
01:37:36,110 --> 01:37:38,084
And for you to bring it up
in front of these people...

1274
01:37:38,190 --> 01:37:40,579
These people happen
to be my friends.

1275
01:37:40,686 --> 01:37:42,574
You know, I had a life

1276
01:37:42,669 --> 01:37:45,637
before I met you.
You can't wish away my past!

1277
01:38:17,646 --> 01:38:20,013
You know I can't read French.

1278
01:38:20,109 --> 01:38:23,655
It's an offer to teach...
at the Sorbonne.

1279
01:38:27,214 --> 01:38:30,280
Don't worry. I turned it down.

1280
01:38:30,382 --> 01:38:32,869
I'm going to be a
good Bengali housewife,

1281
01:38:32,974 --> 01:38:35,657
and make samosas every
Thursday from scratch.

1282
01:38:45,773 --> 01:38:49,221
It's so hard to know
what to do sometimes.

1283
01:38:49,326 --> 01:38:53,286
I was looking at this Joseph
Campbell book the other day.

1284
01:38:53,390 --> 01:38:56,423
And he says
when you feel lost,

1285
01:38:56,526 --> 01:38:57,955
you should close your eyes

1286
01:38:58,061 --> 01:39:00,167
and think of when
you were most happy.

1287
01:39:00,269 --> 01:39:02,091
Not thrilled.

1288
01:39:02,189 --> 01:39:05,059
Just... deeply happy.

1289
01:39:05,166 --> 01:39:07,588
It's called"following your bliss."

1290
01:39:09,358 --> 01:39:11,398
You wanna try it?

1291
01:39:16,845 --> 01:39:18,569
Well?

1292
01:39:21,358 --> 01:39:23,746
Ashima? You all right?

1293
01:39:23,854 --> 01:39:25,348
Hmm.

1294
01:39:27,630 --> 01:39:31,208
I've been thinking of leaving.

1295
01:39:31,309 --> 01:39:33,765
Is that very selfish of me?

1296
01:39:35,886 --> 01:39:39,596
You know, I thought now that the
children are both well settled.

1297
01:39:46,126 --> 01:39:48,995
§ §

1298
01:40:09,582 --> 01:40:10,760
One day...

1299
01:40:10,861 --> 01:40:12,422
I hope you will turn to this book...

1300
01:40:14,030 --> 01:40:15,208
and remember.

1301
01:40:17,581 --> 01:40:19,239
Your Pierre.

1302
01:40:31,533 --> 01:40:33,224
ASHl MA: You don't know how

1303
01:40:33,326 --> 01:40:35,213
happy I am
that both my children

1304
01:40:35,309 --> 01:40:37,927
have found their life partners.

1305
01:40:38,030 --> 01:40:41,772
You don't mind
that Ben's not Indian?

1306
01:40:41,870 --> 01:40:44,291
Times have changed.

1307
01:40:44,398 --> 01:40:46,667
No, I don't mind.

1308
01:40:46,766 --> 01:40:49,035
He's a very good boy, you know?

1309
01:40:49,134 --> 01:40:51,687
And he makes Sonia very happy.

1310
01:40:51,789 --> 01:40:53,928
She is following her bliss.

1311
01:40:54,030 --> 01:40:56,583
You've been reading Joseph Campbell.

1312
01:41:08,046 --> 01:41:08,973
It's you.

1313
01:41:11,181 --> 01:41:13,221
Frying samosas with my mother-in-law.

1314
01:41:13,325 --> 01:41:14,373
And you?

1315
01:41:16,205 --> 01:41:17,351
See you later.

1316
01:41:17,453 --> 01:41:19,046
Kisses.

1317
01:41:23,694 --> 01:41:26,061
I still can't believe my little
sister's getting married.

1318
01:41:26,157 --> 01:41:27,237
Better believe it, Goggles.

1319
01:41:28,461 --> 01:41:30,316
ASHl MA: I have something to say.

1320
01:41:30,414 --> 01:41:33,097
Gogol, I did not want
to tell you on the phone.

1321
01:41:33,198 --> 01:41:35,947
Uh, I have decided
to sell the house.

1322
01:41:37,230 --> 01:41:38,658
I am going
to do what

1323
01:41:38,766 --> 01:41:41,155
your father and l
had always planned.

1324
01:41:41,261 --> 01:41:42,788
Six months in India,

1325
01:41:42,894 --> 01:41:44,803
and six months here with all of you.

1326
01:41:44,909 --> 01:41:46,666
And then I can
go ahead and start

1327
01:41:46,765 --> 01:41:48,423
my singing again in Calcutta.

1328
01:41:48,525 --> 01:41:50,598
That is, if any guru wants
a 45-year-old student.

1329
01:41:51,886 --> 01:41:53,195
Of course they will.
Of course, Mom.

1330
01:41:54,509 --> 01:41:56,070
I want to be free.

1331
01:41:56,173 --> 01:41:58,279
Mm-hmm, like your name.

1332
01:41:58,381 --> 01:41:59,591
GOGOL: What do you mean?

1333
01:41:59,693 --> 01:42:01,832
Ashima means"without borders."

1334
01:42:01,933 --> 01:42:03,559
"Limitless."

1335
01:42:18,189 --> 01:42:19,050
Mo.

1336
01:42:19,149 --> 01:42:20,164
ASHl MA: No Mo. Your ma.

1337
01:42:20,269 --> 01:42:22,342
Hey, Ma. What's up?

1338
01:42:22,445 --> 01:42:24,998
Uh, Gogol, there's a buyer
for the house.

1339
01:42:25,101 --> 01:42:26,181
Are they meeting your price?

1340
01:42:26,285 --> 01:42:27,365
Yes.

1341
01:42:27,470 --> 01:42:28,714
Then do it, Ma.

1342
01:42:28,813 --> 01:42:32,042
I have told them they will have
to wait until after Christmas.

1343
01:42:32,141 --> 01:42:33,897
Both of you are coming, aren't you?

1344
01:42:33,997 --> 01:42:35,109
Of course.

1345
01:42:35,213 --> 01:42:37,668
It will be the last party
at Pemberton Road.

1346
01:42:37,774 --> 01:42:40,195
I know.

1347
01:42:50,029 --> 01:42:51,523
I don't see it.

1348
01:42:51,629 --> 01:42:53,451
Ooh.

1349
01:42:56,366 --> 01:42:58,438
So, this year...

1350
01:42:58,542 --> 01:42:59,786
Mm-hmm.

1351
01:42:59,885 --> 01:43:03,431
...they're renting a house
in the Pyrenees for the summer.

1352
01:43:03,534 --> 01:43:04,581
Oh.

1353
01:43:04,685 --> 01:43:06,409
And I told them we might join them.

1354
01:43:06,509 --> 01:43:08,484
Astrid and Donald
for an entire summer.

1355
01:43:08,590 --> 01:43:09,833
Can't.

1356
01:43:09,933 --> 01:43:11,940
Yeah, but the Pyrenees
are so beautiful.

1357
01:43:12,045 --> 01:43:13,190
Pierre says it's possibly...

1358
01:43:13,294 --> 01:43:15,181
Who's Pierre?

1359
01:43:20,974 --> 01:43:22,348
Hmm?

1360
01:43:27,213 --> 01:43:29,515
Are you having an affair?

1361
01:43:33,454 --> 01:43:35,308
Are you?

1362
01:43:39,566 --> 01:43:41,289
Who is he?

1363
01:43:43,054 --> 01:43:46,315
Someone I've known a long time.

1364
01:43:46,413 --> 01:43:47,526
Why?!

1365
01:43:52,206 --> 01:43:54,093
I saw myself becoming my mother.

1366
01:43:54,189 --> 01:43:57,036
I saw myself stuck.

1367
01:44:01,646 --> 01:44:05,475
Look, maybe it's not enough
that we're both Bengali.

1368
01:44:11,277 --> 01:44:13,099
That's not why I love you.

1369
01:44:33,741 --> 01:44:35,748
So, when are you giving us
the good news?

1370
01:44:35,854 --> 01:44:36,966
Just because
your mother's going

1371
01:44:37,070 --> 01:44:38,793
doesn't mean you have
to forget about us.

1372
01:44:38,894 --> 01:44:40,006
Yes. You must come over.

1373
01:44:40,109 --> 01:44:41,516
You should not feel shy.

1374
01:44:41,614 --> 01:44:42,628
Hey...
Hey.

1375
01:44:42,734 --> 01:44:44,010
Remember, we're your family, also.

1376
01:44:44,109 --> 01:44:45,702
Mm-hmm.
And we're still there.

1377
01:44:45,806 --> 01:44:46,820
Thanks.

1378
01:44:46,926 --> 01:44:48,835
Dude, I am never gonna
remember all these names.

1379
01:44:48,942 --> 01:44:50,632
It's all right, man.
You don't have to.

1380
01:44:50,733 --> 01:44:52,227
Just call everyone Auntie.
You'll be fine.

1381
01:44:52,334 --> 01:44:54,156
Sonia?
Where's Moushumi?

1382
01:45:09,389 --> 01:45:10,469
Ah.

1383
01:45:17,486 --> 01:45:18,434
Uh-huh.

1384
01:45:18,541 --> 01:45:21,324
Nah. Nah.

1385
01:46:03,629 --> 01:46:04,741
Ah.

1386
01:46:18,541 --> 01:46:21,356
We all came out of Gogol's overcoat.

1387
01:46:24,173 --> 01:46:26,246
One day, you will understand.

1388
01:46:39,021 --> 01:46:40,199
Hey, Gogoli.

1389
01:46:40,301 --> 01:46:42,276
Hey, Ma.

1390
01:46:45,485 --> 01:46:47,372
Oh, Baba...

1391
01:46:50,093 --> 01:46:52,232
Everything is okay?

1392
01:46:52,334 --> 01:46:55,051
Hmm, between Moushumi and you, hmm?

1393
01:47:01,357 --> 01:47:03,878
Ma, Moushumi found someone else.

1394
01:47:08,237 --> 01:47:10,604
Some... some old boyfriend.

1395
01:47:10,701 --> 01:47:12,589
A French guy named Pierre.

1396
01:47:15,181 --> 01:47:19,075
For once, somebody else's name
bothered me more than my own.

1397
01:47:20,749 --> 01:47:22,505
Oh.

1398
01:47:22,605 --> 01:47:24,547
It is all my fault.

1399
01:47:26,349 --> 01:47:27,942
I am sorry, Gogol.

1400
01:47:28,045 --> 01:47:30,217
Ma...

1401
01:47:30,317 --> 01:47:32,619
Ma, it has nothing to do with you.

1402
01:47:34,445 --> 01:47:35,754
We're different people.

1403
01:47:35,853 --> 01:47:37,708
We wanted different things.

1404
01:47:38,829 --> 01:47:40,934
I will not go back to India now.

1405
01:47:41,037 --> 01:47:42,892
I cannot go.

1406
01:47:42,989 --> 01:47:45,062
Oh, you have to go.

1407
01:47:45,165 --> 01:47:47,434
Listen to me...

1408
01:47:47,533 --> 01:47:49,900
you know, l-I know that
I'm supposed to be devastated.

1409
01:47:49,997 --> 01:47:51,426
Everybody's gone,

1410
01:47:51,533 --> 01:47:54,403
but... I know this is
gonna sound crazy, but

1411
01:47:54,509 --> 01:47:57,771
for the first time in my life,
I actually feel free.

1412
01:48:01,005 --> 01:48:03,339
Look...

1413
01:48:03,437 --> 01:48:06,666
Look what I found.

1414
01:48:06,765 --> 01:48:09,765
It's Baba's graduation gift
from high school.

1415
01:48:09,869 --> 01:48:11,691
See?

1416
01:48:11,789 --> 01:48:14,123
ASHOKE:"For Gogol Ganguli.

1417
01:48:14,221 --> 01:48:16,905
"The man who gave you his name,

1418
01:48:17,005 --> 01:48:19,493
from the man
who gave you your name."

1419
01:48:19,597 --> 01:48:22,630
There are no accidents, Gogol.

1420
01:48:22,733 --> 01:48:25,188
Baba made you find it.

1421
01:48:25,293 --> 01:48:27,912
He is with us.

1422
01:48:35,054 --> 01:48:37,901
§ §

1423
01:48:42,189 --> 01:48:44,229
ASHl MA:
Don't go so far

1424
01:48:44,333 --> 01:48:45,860
that I cannot see you!

1425
01:48:45,965 --> 01:48:47,492
He's too little!

1426
01:48:47,597 --> 01:48:49,058
Jump,jump.

1427
01:48:52,685 --> 01:48:54,725
Are you listening?

1428
01:49:10,061 --> 01:49:11,174
The camera.

1429
01:49:11,277 --> 01:49:12,706
It is in the car.

1430
01:49:20,653 --> 01:49:23,108
All this way, and no picture.

1431
01:49:23,213 --> 01:49:25,514
Huh?

1432
01:49:28,269 --> 01:49:31,847
We just have to remember it then, huh?

1433
01:49:31,949 --> 01:49:35,560
Will you remember this day, Gogol?

1434
01:49:35,661 --> 01:49:37,570
How long do I have to remember it?

1435
01:49:39,757 --> 01:49:42,474
Ah, remember it always.

1436
01:49:42,573 --> 01:49:45,704
Remember that you
and I made the journey,

1437
01:49:45,805 --> 01:49:49,383
and went together to a place

1438
01:49:49,485 --> 01:49:52,518
where there was nowhere left to go.

1439
01:50:03,725 --> 01:50:07,522
ASHl MA:
For 25 years, I missed my life in India.

1440
01:50:10,573 --> 01:50:14,315
And now,
I will miss my life here,

1441
01:50:14,413 --> 01:50:16,802
and all of you

1442
01:50:16,909 --> 01:50:19,048
who became my family.

1443
01:50:21,773 --> 01:50:23,660
I will miss

1444
01:50:23,757 --> 01:50:25,666
living with my daughter

1445
01:50:25,773 --> 01:50:29,831
and the surprising
friendship we formed.

1446
01:50:29,933 --> 01:50:32,300
I will miss phoning my son

1447
01:50:32,397 --> 01:50:34,917
at all times of day or night.

1448
01:50:37,453 --> 01:50:40,748
And I will miss
this country

1449
01:50:42,093 --> 01:50:47,079
in which I had grown to know
and love my husband.

1450
01:50:48,621 --> 01:50:52,647
And though his ashes
are scattered in the Ganges...

1451
01:50:54,029 --> 01:50:56,615
...it is here, in this house,

1452
01:50:56,717 --> 01:50:58,790
in this town,

1453
01:50:58,893 --> 01:51:01,860
amongst all of you...

1454
01:51:01,965 --> 01:51:05,827
that he will continue
to dwell in my heart.

1455
01:51:09,581 --> 01:51:11,369
Hear, hear!

1456
01:51:11,469 --> 01:51:12,549
Long live Ashima.

1457
01:51:12,653 --> 01:51:14,475
Cheers.
Cheers.

1458
01:51:14,573 --> 01:51:15,369
Cheers. Cheers.
