1
00:00:45,881 --> 00:00:46,966
<i>You're obsessed with him.</i>

2
00:00:46,966 --> 00:00:49,468
<i>I'm not obsessed.
I'm just highly interested.</i>

3
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:50,970
<i>Come on. Let's settle this.</i>

4
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:52,930
Girls, please, sit. Sit.

5
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,723
Let Zela read your palms.

6
00:00:54,723 --> 00:00:56,141
Oh, no. Forget it. This is stupid.

7
00:00:56,183 --> 00:00:59,520
So are you. Sit down.

8
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,939
OK. Zela, this is it.

9
00:01:01,939 --> 00:01:05,192
My friend here is basically obsessed
with this guy that won't call her back

10
00:01:05,192 --> 00:01:10,114
and we need to know if she should forget
him cold or hold out for the next 20 years.

11
00:01:10,114 --> 00:01:15,786
Well, anyways, whatever you see,
just say, "Forget his ass. "

12
00:01:14,728 --> 00:01:17,688
No, no, no, no, no, no.
I need you to read my friend's.

13
00:01:17,688 --> 00:01:19,489
Blood.

14
00:01:19,489 --> 00:01:22,970
- Excuse me?
- I see blood.

15
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,810
So much blood.

16
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:28,970
OK, that's nice, but...

17
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,530
You too.

18
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:33,490
You're both in danger.

19
00:01:33,490 --> 00:01:36,330
Need to know?
No. Back to the guy.

20
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,611
It's not the guy.

21
00:01:39,611 --> 00:01:42,651
It's... it's the beast you should fear.

22
00:01:42,651 --> 00:01:43,932
OK.

23
00:01:43,932 --> 00:01:45,771
We're done here.

24
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:49,532
- Come on, Becky. Let's go.
- Beware the moon.

25
00:01:49,532 --> 00:01:52,892
It feeds in the moonlight.

26
00:01:52,932 --> 00:01:56,813
You can't tell people this shit.

27
00:01:56,813 --> 00:01:58,853
Jenny.

28
00:01:58,853 --> 00:02:01,173
Lay off the crack pipe.

29
00:02:01,173 --> 00:02:04,254
Jenny.

30
00:02:20,976 --> 00:02:23,936
Jenny!

31
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:48,979
- I'm gonna lock up in the back.
- OK, JosÃ©.

32
00:02:48,979 --> 00:02:51,460
Hey, looks like you got a visitor.

33
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:55,660
Hey, there, boy.
Where did you come from?

34
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,860
Come here.

35
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:00,580
Oh.

36
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,620
Zipper? Zip?

37
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:04,380
Zipper. Hey, hey, Zipper.

38
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,861
Hey.

39
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:08,701
- Oh, there you are. I'm sorry.
- Oh, no. He's adorable.

40
00:03:08,701 --> 00:03:10,662
Come here.

41
00:03:10,662 --> 00:03:13,141
I'm sorry. One minute he's here,
the next minute...

42
00:03:13,141 --> 00:03:16,423
Wh... Hey, uh, Brooke, right?

43
00:03:16,542 --> 00:03:19,583
- Do I know you?
- Oh, yeah. We go to school together.

44
00:03:19,583 --> 00:03:23,503
I sit behind you in Government,
Algebra and French.

45
00:03:23,543 --> 00:03:25,423
Oh, really?

46
00:03:25,423 --> 00:03:28,184
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, Brooke Mueller. Jimmy Myers.

47
00:03:28,184 --> 00:03:31,464
M-u, M-y.
I've sat behind you for, like, three years.

48
00:03:31,464 --> 00:03:34,344
- Oh.
- Yeah.

49
00:03:34,344 --> 00:03:36,145
- OK.
- Hey, Brooke, are you ready?

50
00:03:36,145 --> 00:03:38,705
Yeah, almost. Five minutes.

51
00:03:38,705 --> 00:03:40,265
- I'll see you at school.
- OK, yeah. No, I know.

52
00:03:40,265 --> 00:03:42,065
Hey, I know you.

53
00:03:42,065 --> 00:03:44,266
- From P. E.
- His name's Billy.

54
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,986
- Uh, it's Jimmy.
- You're the dodgeball crotch target.

55
00:03:46,986 --> 00:03:49,986
- You should really wear a cup.
- Stop it, Bo. OK?

56
00:03:49,986 --> 00:03:54,586
I'm just looking out for him. He can't help it.
Every school's got one, the derogatory "it. "

57
00:03:54,586 --> 00:03:56,906
A geek on his way to fag town.

58
00:03:56,906 --> 00:03:59,027
- Look. I'm not gay.
- Bummer.

59
00:03:59,027 --> 00:04:01,987
You mean you're just
an ass wimp-wad for no reason?

60
00:04:01,987 --> 00:04:04,908
<i>- Yep.
- That sucks.</i>

61
00:04:04,908 --> 00:04:06,948
<i>- Boo!
- Whoa!</i>

62
00:04:06,948 --> 00:04:09,428
You're such a dick, Bo.

63
00:04:09,428 --> 00:04:12,828
Just ignore him, Jimmy.

64
00:04:12,828 --> 00:04:16,629
<i>I think your dog is gay too.</i>

65
00:04:16,629 --> 00:04:20,149
<i>What's with the Make-A-Wish
charity case, Brooke?</i>

66
00:04:31,431 --> 00:04:34,591
- Hey, Ellie.
- Hi.

67
00:04:35,712 --> 00:04:36,831
<i>- Hello?
- Ellie.</i>

68
00:04:36,831 --> 00:04:37,791
<i>- Hi, Jimmy.
- I'm waiting.</i>

69
00:04:37,831 --> 00:04:40,312
Yeah, I know. I stopped by Tinsel
on my way, to see Jake.

70
00:04:40,312 --> 00:04:41,952
<i>- But I'm your brother.
- I'll be there soon.</i>

71
00:04:41,952 --> 00:04:44,912
<i>- Well, how soon?
- I said soon, OK?</i>

72
00:04:44,912 --> 00:04:46,072
<i>- Do you know what can happen to me?
- Yes.</i>

73
00:04:46,072 --> 00:04:48,512
I know what can happen
to a teenager on Hollywood Boulevard.

74
00:04:48,512 --> 00:04:49,913
<i>- Do you?
- OK. Quit whining.</i>

75
00:04:49,913 --> 00:04:52,393
<i>- Fine.
- Yeah. Bye.</i>

76
00:04:53,274 --> 00:04:56,514
Perfect.

77
00:05:02,315 --> 00:05:04,475
- Excellent. Excellent!
- Cool.

78
00:05:04,475 --> 00:05:07,315
50 grand well-spent.

79
00:05:07,315 --> 00:05:12,275
- OK. Looking good up there now.
- You got it.

80
00:05:12,955 --> 00:05:14,476
- Ellie.
- Hi.

81
00:05:14,476 --> 00:05:17,636
Hi.

82
00:05:17,636 --> 00:05:20,957
- How's it going?
- We're not even close to finished.

83
00:05:20,957 --> 00:05:25,717
I got four days work and the opening's
in two. I am drowning in stress.

84
00:05:25,717 --> 00:05:28,238
Kiss me again.

85
00:05:28,238 --> 00:05:29,998
<i>What are you doing here?</i>

86
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:32,677
- That's good. I told you. That's good.
- I haven't seen you in days.

87
00:05:32,677 --> 00:05:35,758
I wanted to make sure you were still alive.
What is this?

88
00:05:35,758 --> 00:05:37,878
It's a medieval torture device.

89
00:05:37,878 --> 00:05:40,679
Which could actually be fun later.

90
00:05:40,679 --> 00:05:43,279
Come on.
I'll give you the two-second tour.

91
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:46,159
Spanish Inquisition.

92
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:48,719
Frankenstein's laboratory.

93
00:05:48,719 --> 00:05:51,880
Dracula's coffin.

94
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,041
What's that?

95
00:05:54,041 --> 00:05:55,681
Oh, that.

96
00:05:55,681 --> 00:06:00,401
<i>That is a sterling replica to commemorate
the 50th anniversary of The Wolf Man.</i>

97
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,801
It was donated by the Chaney estate.

98
00:06:02,801 --> 00:06:04,081
Wow.

99
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:06,482
Planet Hollywood
has nothing on you guys.

100
00:06:06,482 --> 00:06:10,482
Sh. We don't mention them here.

101
00:06:11,402 --> 00:06:13,402
So, I was thinking.

102
00:06:13,402 --> 00:06:16,002
I'll be here for the opening,
and you'll be here.

103
00:06:16,002 --> 00:06:18,563
so how about we be here together?

104
00:06:18,563 --> 00:06:21,204
If I was actually going to the opening.

105
00:06:21,204 --> 00:06:25,404
What do you mean? You have to go.
It's your big night. You have to show off.

106
00:06:25,404 --> 00:06:27,844
All I wanna do is crawl into bed
and disappear for three days.

107
00:06:27,844 --> 00:06:29,764
Well, even better.

108
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:33,405
I'll crawl in too.

109
00:06:35,845 --> 00:06:38,085
<i>Excuse me.
I need a signature on this.</i>

110
00:06:38,085 --> 00:06:42,126
Damn. Can you hold on for one second?

111
00:06:43,646 --> 00:06:45,887
<i>- Right there.
- Thanks.</i>

112
00:06:45,887 --> 00:06:48,846
Yeah.

113
00:06:48,846 --> 00:06:52,127
Jake?

114
00:06:52,127 --> 00:06:55,047
Is there something wrong?

115
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:59,247
No. There's nothing wrong. I'm just
stressed out with work and this madness.

116
00:06:59,247 --> 00:07:02,648
I just... I need some time
and some space.

117
00:07:02,648 --> 00:07:05,688
OK.

118
00:07:06,449 --> 00:07:12,169
Just call me, when you feel like it,
you know? No pressure.

119
00:07:29,971 --> 00:07:33,332
I waited over an hour for you.

120
00:07:33,332 --> 00:07:36,092
I'm sorry, OK?

121
00:07:36,092 --> 00:07:38,612
- Do you want to drop it?
- For over an hour. I waited.

122
00:07:38,612 --> 00:07:41,533
Yeah, well, most teenagers
have friends who give them a lift home.

123
00:07:41,533 --> 00:07:45,733
- But then I couldn't inconvenience you.
- Not tonight, Jimmy. Can we just not fight?

124
00:07:46,573 --> 00:07:49,693
Watch out!

125
00:08:10,616 --> 00:08:13,376
<i>- Are you OK?
- Yeah.</i>

126
00:08:13,376 --> 00:08:15,697
Zipper.

127
00:08:15,697 --> 00:08:17,217
It's OK, boy.

128
00:08:17,217 --> 00:08:23,018
Someone could be hurt.
Find my cellphone. Call for help.

129
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,259
<i>- Hello?
- Oh, God. Help me. Please!</i>

130
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:45,220
I'm coming.

131
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,460
<i>Help me, please!</i>

132
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:51,661
I'm coming.
I'm trying to get to you.

133
00:08:53,941 --> 00:08:57,221
- Are you OK?
- Please just get me out of here. I'm stuck.

134
00:08:57,221 --> 00:08:59,141
OK. OK.

135
00:08:59,141 --> 00:09:02,702
Oh, God. Help!

136
00:09:02,702 --> 00:09:05,982
- Help me, God.
- Can you feel your legs?

137
00:09:05,982 --> 00:09:11,023
- I think so. The dashboard's just caved in.
- OK.

138
00:09:12,223 --> 00:09:16,384
- Do you have a jack?
- Uh, yeah. Yeah. It's in the trunk.

139
00:09:16,384 --> 00:09:19,264
All right. I'm gonna try to go get it, OK?
I'll be right back.

140
00:09:19,264 --> 00:09:23,344
OK. Hurry, please!

141
00:09:25,985 --> 00:09:28,785
<i>Oh, God.</i>

142
00:09:28,785 --> 00:09:32,426
<i>Hello? Hello? No, no. I can't hear you.</i>

143
00:09:32,426 --> 00:09:34,306
<i>Shit. AT&T...</i>

144
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:38,626
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, stop! Stop!

145
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:43,947
<i>- Jesus, people, what's wrong with you?
- 911 emergency. Hello? Hello?</i>

146
00:09:43,947 --> 00:09:46,787
<i>- Hello? Wait. wait. Can you hear me now?
- 911 emergency. Yes, I can, sir.</i>

147
00:09:46,787 --> 00:09:48,387
<i>- All right, listen, there's been a wreck.
- Where, sir?</i>

148
00:09:48,387 --> 00:09:52,347
I'm on Mulholland Drive,
just east of Coldwater.

149
00:10:06,789 --> 00:10:09,789
- Jesus.
- Hey, calm down. It's just me.

150
00:10:09,789 --> 00:10:12,750
- I called for help.
- Oh, good.

151
00:10:12,909 --> 00:10:15,110
<i>What's going on out there?</i>

152
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:17,151
I couldn't get the trunk open.

153
00:10:17,151 --> 00:10:20,671
but help's on the way, OK?
Just hold on a few more minutes.

154
00:10:20,671 --> 00:10:23,711
- Do you hear that?
- What?

155
00:10:23,711 --> 00:10:25,751
I hear dripping, like leaking.

156
00:10:25,751 --> 00:10:28,831
Do you smell gas? I smell gas.
Oh, God. The car's gonna blow up.

157
00:10:28,831 --> 00:10:32,352
- No, no, no. The car is not gonna blow up.
- Uh, actually it could.

158
00:10:32,352 --> 00:10:35,272
- Jesus Christ, get me the fuck out of here!
- OK, all right, all right.

159
00:10:35,312 --> 00:10:38,793
Let me try.

160
00:10:38,793 --> 00:10:40,473
Uh, hi.

161
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:42,234
- If I could get up, underneath...
- Just do it!

162
00:10:42,234 --> 00:10:44,314
OK. OK. All right.

163
00:10:44,314 --> 00:10:47,954
- Wait. All right. I think I'm getting it.
- Oh, God. Please, please.

164
00:10:47,954 --> 00:10:49,874
<i>Wait,
can you be still for a second?</i>

165
00:10:49,914 --> 00:10:55,075
You try flipping your car down a mountain
and then being fucking still.

166
00:10:55,075 --> 00:10:57,755
Maybe you guys should hurry up.

167
00:10:57,755 --> 00:10:59,515
<i>- All right. Calm down.
- I am calm!</i>

168
00:10:59,515 --> 00:11:02,075
<i>I think I'm getting it.</i>

169
00:11:02,116 --> 00:11:04,516
All right, OK.

170
00:11:04,516 --> 00:11:06,516
- OK, I got it.
- Oh, my God. Thank you.

171
00:11:06,516 --> 00:11:08,437
Oh, help me with the seat belt.

172
00:11:08,437 --> 00:11:10,996
Oh, shit.

173
00:11:10,996 --> 00:11:13,597
Oh, shit. OK.

174
00:11:13,597 --> 00:11:15,477
- OK. OK.
- Oh.

175
00:11:15,477 --> 00:11:17,437
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

176
00:11:17,437 --> 00:11:22,078
<i>My legs... There's help. They hurt.</i>

177
00:11:22,638 --> 00:11:24,638
The police are coming.

178
00:11:24,638 --> 00:11:26,839
Yeah, well.
I hope you guys have insurance.

179
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,839
What? No, no, it was an accident. We hit
an animal, or it hit us. I'm not even sure.

180
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,999
- It wasn't a dog, was it?
- Actually, it was...

181
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:40,559
Ellie! Hold on to me.

182
00:11:48,361 --> 00:11:50,161
<i>Jimmy!</i>

183
00:11:50,161 --> 00:11:53,641
No!

184
00:11:56,802 --> 00:12:00,002
<i>Jimmy!</i>

185
00:12:01,202 --> 00:12:04,322
<i>Ellie.</i>

186
00:12:04,322 --> 00:12:06,843
Go! Go!

187
00:12:06,843 --> 00:12:11,723
- Do you think she...?
- No. No, go. Go, go, go.

188
00:12:22,605 --> 00:12:24,805
Oh, Jimmy.

189
00:12:24,805 --> 00:12:28,006
Shit, look at your arm.

190
00:12:32,926 --> 00:12:39,286
<i>- They're ready for us now.
- They said it was pretty nasty.</i>

191
00:12:39,286 --> 00:12:43,887
Let me get this straight. It took a bite
out of your arm, but you didn't see it at all?

192
00:12:43,887 --> 00:12:46,847
Well, it all happened so fast
and it was dark.

193
00:12:46,847 --> 00:12:51,328
Well, I saw it. It was a wolf, but bigger.
It was like a monster wolf.

194
00:12:51,328 --> 00:12:53,529
Yeah, Jimmy.
I have your statement already.

195
00:12:53,529 --> 00:12:56,008
Fine. Don't believe me.
I know what I saw.

196
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,569
What happened to her...

197
00:12:58,569 --> 00:13:01,129
what kind of an animal could do that?

198
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:04,009
A mountain lion, a bear, maybe.

199
00:13:04,009 --> 00:13:08,610
There hasn't been a wolf sighting
in Southern California in over 70 years.

200
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,010
- Mountain lion, my ass.
- Jimmy.

201
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:13,651
Please.

202
00:13:13,651 --> 00:13:17,571
Why don't you go check on Zipper?

203
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:22,812
Don't worry.
Whatever it was, we'll find it.

204
00:13:23,572 --> 00:13:25,732
Hey, buddy, are you OK?

205
00:13:25,732 --> 00:13:27,572
Zipper?

206
00:13:27,572 --> 00:13:29,853
<i>What's wrong?</i>

207
00:13:29,853 --> 00:13:31,852
Hey, smell. It's just me.

208
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:35,693
Hey! Hey, look what you did.

209
00:13:37,173 --> 00:13:41,013
That's enough with the biting.

210
00:13:42,854 --> 00:13:45,894
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

211
00:13:45,894 --> 00:13:51,895
<i>- Hey, you guys be safe.
- All right, come on. Let's go.</i>

212
00:13:58,536 --> 00:14:01,496
Hey.

213
00:14:03,096 --> 00:14:06,337
<i>Hey. Zipper. Come on in.</i>

214
00:14:06,337 --> 00:14:08,856
Hey, Zipper, come on in.

215
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:11,337
Hey. Whoa.

216
00:14:14,058 --> 00:14:17,217
Freak.

217
00:14:17,858 --> 00:14:21,218
- Well, good night.
- Hey.

218
00:14:21,218 --> 00:14:22,578
What?

219
00:14:22,578 --> 00:14:24,539
Don't you wanna talk
about what happened tonight?

220
00:14:24,539 --> 00:14:27,739
- What's there to talk about?
- Jimmy, we were attacked.

221
00:14:27,739 --> 00:14:29,299
We saw a girl get torn apart.

222
00:14:29,299 --> 00:14:32,940
You wanna talk about the bear
or the mountain lion?

223
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:36,580
Look. I know you're mad at me,
but I didn't see what you saw.

224
00:14:36,580 --> 00:14:40,820
I'm sorry,
but I don't know what else to say.

225
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,301
OK, well, uh, thanks for the talk.
Good night.

226
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:46,181
Oh, come on, Jimmy.

227
00:14:46,181 --> 00:14:49,942
I'm trying here.

228
00:16:20,112 --> 00:16:22,752
"Unsolved... "

229
00:16:22,752 --> 00:16:25,473
OK.

230
00:16:27,353 --> 00:16:30,513
Jesus. "1600 animal attacks... "

231
00:16:30,513 --> 00:16:33,873
"... large wolf-like animals. "

232
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:39,154
Oh, my God.

233
00:18:48,569 --> 00:18:53,089
- Oh, sorry. I didn't mean to scare you.
- What are you doing here?

234
00:18:53,089 --> 00:18:55,090
I just... I needed to talk to you.

235
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:58,890
I found the extra key under the mat.
I'm really sorry.

236
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:01,650
I just, I feel so terrible
about how we left things tonight.

237
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:06,571
- Jake, what's going on?
- I'm just scared, Ellie.

238
00:19:06,571 --> 00:19:09,451
I'm scared.

239
00:19:09,491 --> 00:19:13,732
I never expected
to meet a woman like you.

240
00:19:13,732 --> 00:19:18,892
Jake, you're the only good thing
that's happened in my life in a long time.

241
00:19:18,892 --> 00:19:21,173
I'm scared too.

242
00:19:21,173 --> 00:19:23,253
I'm terrified.

243
00:19:23,253 --> 00:19:28,133
because all the good things
keep going away.

244
00:19:29,254 --> 00:19:32,894
I'm not going anywhere.

245
00:20:38,382 --> 00:20:41,942
<i>Here in Los Angeles,
a young woman was attacked and killed</i>

246
00:20:41,942 --> 00:20:44,142
<i>by an unidentified wild animal</i>

247
00:20:44,142 --> 00:20:47,942
<i>when her car ran off the road last night,
high in the Hollywood hills.</i>

248
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:50,263
<i>The victim's name has yet to be released.</i>

249
00:20:50,263 --> 00:20:54,464
<i>It happened on a remote stretch of
Mulholland Drive, shortly before midnight.</i>

250
00:20:54,464 --> 00:20:57,783
<i>Animal control officers speculate
that it might have been a bear</i>

251
00:20:57,783 --> 00:21:00,584
<i>that wandered into the area
in search of water.</i>

252
00:21:00,584 --> 00:21:04,985
<i>It is the first such fatal attack
in Los Angeles...</i>

253
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:29,507
- Hey.
- How are you doing? Did you sleep OK?

254
00:21:29,507 --> 00:21:31,748
I woke up in the bushes.

255
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:34,028
You woke up where?

256
00:21:34,028 --> 00:21:36,309
Are you feeling OK?
I'm calling Dr. Steinberg.

257
00:21:36,309 --> 00:21:40,389
No, no. I'm fine. Really.
Actually... I feel kinda great.

258
00:21:40,389 --> 00:21:43,389
OK.

259
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:47,509
But I'm gonna make an appointment. They
said we should follow up with another shot.

260
00:21:47,509 --> 00:21:50,590
For all we know,
that wolf could've had rabies.

261
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:51,990
Oh. Oh, so now it's a wolf.

262
00:21:51,990 --> 00:21:54,630
Jimmy, I never said it wasn't.
I just said I didn't see it.

263
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,431
It was more like a werewolf.

264
00:21:56,431 --> 00:21:58,671
And I found this website last night
and according to legend,

265
00:21:58,671 --> 00:22:01,431
a werewolf feeds during the lunar cycle -
that's the three nights around the full moon.

266
00:22:01,431 --> 00:22:03,831
Last night was the first moon
of the lunar cycle.

267
00:22:03,831 --> 00:22:06,752
Why can't you just download porn
like other teenage boys?

268
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:10,232
Excuse me for trying
to make conversation.

269
00:22:10,232 --> 00:22:12,752
OK, so what would a werewolf
be doing in LA?

270
00:22:12,752 --> 00:22:15,992
Shouldn't it be off in the countryside
somewhere, terrorizing helpless maidens?

271
00:22:15,992 --> 00:22:21,633
Maybe it's a hip werewolf. Maidens come
here with the perfectly implanted breasts.

272
00:22:21,633 --> 00:22:24,233
- You should get to school.
- Hey, I was bitten by a werewolf.

273
00:22:24,233 --> 00:22:26,794
If that's not good enough for a sick day...
I could be cursed.

274
00:22:26,794 --> 00:22:29,034
Everybody's cursed, Jimmy.
It's called life.

275
00:22:29,034 --> 00:22:31,354
No, I mean by the mark of the beast.

276
00:22:31,354 --> 00:22:36,275
Is that what the kids
are calling it these days?

277
00:22:48,717 --> 00:22:51,397
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

278
00:22:55,757 --> 00:22:58,438
<i>- Whoa. Hey, Ellie.
- Hey, Kyle.</i>

279
00:22:58,438 --> 00:23:01,878
Hey, '70s retro week is booking up. Do we
want Keith Partridge or Marcia Brady?

280
00:23:01,878 --> 00:23:03,598
- Only one slot left.
- Marcia, Marcia, Marcia.

281
00:23:03,598 --> 00:23:06,998
You look different today.
Saucy. I like it.

282
00:23:06,998 --> 00:23:10,039
- Yeah, it's new. Gauze look.
- Nice. What happened?

283
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:13,639
- Oh, you don't wanna know.
- Hey, are you OK?

284
00:23:13,639 --> 00:23:16,600
Yeah. Actually, I'm fine.

285
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,560
Incoming psycho publicist, one o'clock.

286
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:21,880
...no trades. Oh, I have to go.
Yeah, OK. Goodbye.

287
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:24,320
Ellie? Hi.

288
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:27,761
I didn't recognize you
with your hair down.

289
00:23:27,761 --> 00:23:31,922
I just wanted to drop by to make sure we
were set for Scott's pre-interview tonight.

290
00:23:31,922 --> 00:23:35,922
- Absolutely. Nine o'clock.
- Great. Is that what you're gonna wear?

291
00:23:35,922 --> 00:23:39,322
Hey, I heard that you're dating
Jake Taylor. Is that true?

292
00:23:39,322 --> 00:23:42,162
- I hope it's nothing serious.
- Why not?

293
00:23:42,162 --> 00:23:44,203
I guess it was only a matter of time
before he got to you.

294
00:23:44,203 --> 00:23:47,603
- He always did prefer the vulnerable ones.
- OK, well. I'll see you tonight, Joannie.

295
00:23:47,603 --> 00:23:50,523
I'm only saying this because I care.

296
00:23:50,564 --> 00:23:52,884
Is there anything else, Joannie?

297
00:23:52,884 --> 00:23:55,204
No. Tonight. Don't be late.

298
00:23:55,204 --> 00:23:59,044
- OK. Thank you.
- OK.

299
00:23:59,525 --> 00:24:03,325
Putting on weight, Kyle?

300
00:24:04,205 --> 00:24:07,245
- What a piece of work.
- I do not like that woman.

301
00:24:07,245 --> 00:24:11,806
- No. Apparently Jake didn't either.
- I didn't even know that she knew him.

302
00:24:11,806 --> 00:24:15,167
- Do you think she's right about him?
- No. The woman's cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs.

303
00:24:15,167 --> 00:24:21,807
But I'm not the one dating him.
I just know he's not the only guy in town.

304
00:24:26,808 --> 00:24:28,968
What smells so good?

305
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:33,249
I... I don't smell anything.

306
00:24:56,891 --> 00:24:59,371
I get these.

307
00:24:59,371 --> 00:25:03,212
It's nothing. I'll live.

308
00:25:03,212 --> 00:25:06,132
The blood freaking you out?

309
00:25:15,173 --> 00:25:17,253
- Hey, Brooke, you need some change?
- Hey, Jimmy.

310
00:25:17,253 --> 00:25:19,413
That'd be great.
Stupid thing won't take my dollar.

311
00:25:19,413 --> 00:25:21,774
Oh, yeah. OK. Actually...

312
00:25:21,774 --> 00:25:24,934
- I'll hold those.
- Thanks.

313
00:25:24,934 --> 00:25:26,855
Werewolves, huh?

314
00:25:26,855 --> 00:25:30,095
Oh, it's just a stupid report I'm doing.

315
00:25:30,095 --> 00:25:32,895
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

316
00:25:32,895 --> 00:25:35,936
No, keep your money.
It's on me. Thanks.

317
00:25:35,936 --> 00:25:39,016
<i>Geek juice.</i>

318
00:25:39,016 --> 00:25:43,256
- Trying out for the wrestling team, Jimmy?
- Oh, no. I don't wrestle.

319
00:25:43,256 --> 00:25:49,057
Oh. I'd think all that male-to-male contact
would be right up your alley.

320
00:25:49,697 --> 00:25:53,058
Is, uh... Is that the appeal for you?

321
00:25:53,058 --> 00:25:54,777
Oh. Back talk.

322
00:25:54,777 --> 00:25:57,138
Haven't you been team captain
for, like, two years now?

323
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,139
Nicely done, Jimmy.

324
00:25:59,139 --> 00:26:03,259
Did you just attempt a confrontation?

325
00:26:03,259 --> 00:26:07,339
- Yeah, maybe.
- Let me know when you're sure.

326
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:11,580
Just ignore him, Jimmy.

327
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,820
Let's get out of here
before we get homo-stained.

328
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:18,140
Hey. Hey.

329
00:26:41,583 --> 00:26:43,464
Joannie.

330
00:26:43,464 --> 00:26:46,344
- Joannie.
- There you are.

331
00:26:46,344 --> 00:26:48,744
What is this? Come as
your favorite endangered species?

332
00:26:48,744 --> 00:26:50,384
Obnoxious, isn't it?

333
00:26:50,384 --> 00:26:53,025
I just feel a little underdressed
without a tail.

334
00:26:53,025 --> 00:26:59,665
Well, that's part of your charm.
Take this. I will tell Scott that you're here.

335
00:26:59,665 --> 00:27:03,026
<i>Well, I think you look fantastic.</i>

336
00:27:03,785 --> 00:27:06,226
- What are you doing here?
- I needed to see you.

337
00:27:06,226 --> 00:27:11,667
What about the opening?
Disappearing for a few days.

338
00:27:11,707 --> 00:27:15,427
- That didn't go over so well, did it?
- You know what? It's fine.

339
00:27:15,427 --> 00:27:18,467
We've only been seeing each other
a couple of months, you need your space.

340
00:27:18,467 --> 00:27:21,067
I get it. It's fine.

341
00:27:21,067 --> 00:27:25,788
Please don't do that. Don't try
to make everything OK when it's not.

342
00:27:25,788 --> 00:27:30,189
Can I talk to you in private for a second?

343
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,709
Ellie.

344
00:27:37,709 --> 00:27:42,950
that was my MO for a long time. When
anything would get too close or too serious.

345
00:27:42,950 --> 00:27:45,031
I would just run away.

346
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:47,111
For...

347
00:27:47,111 --> 00:27:50,831
For a variety of reasons
that I can't even begin to go into.

348
00:27:50,831 --> 00:27:55,752
I don't want to do that with us. This thing,
you and me. this is special, Ellie.

349
00:27:55,752 --> 00:27:58,032
and I just don't want to lose you.

350
00:27:58,032 --> 00:28:00,672
So I was hoping that, maybe,

351
00:28:00,672 --> 00:28:04,473
you could just bear with me
for a little while longer.

352
00:28:04,473 --> 00:28:09,713
I guess I'm learning about these things
as we go along.

353
00:28:09,713 --> 00:28:15,234
Well, maybe I'll finish up here
and we can go someplace to talk.

354
00:28:15,234 --> 00:28:18,874
OK. Thank you, Ellie.

355
00:28:18,874 --> 00:28:21,434
Well, hi, there. Remember me?

356
00:28:21,434 --> 00:28:22,514
Uh...

357
00:28:22,514 --> 00:28:25,235
- Jenny Tate, Becky Morton's friend.
- Right. Of course. Jenny.

358
00:28:25,235 --> 00:28:27,156
- It's good to see you again. I was actually...
- Jake.

359
00:28:27,195 --> 00:28:28,796
- Hi.
- Hi. Long time no see.

360
00:28:28,796 --> 00:28:32,675
Sorry to interrupt an awkward moment,
but we're ready for you.

361
00:28:32,675 --> 00:28:35,756
I have to go.

362
00:28:36,116 --> 00:28:38,517
- Ellie.
- I'm working.

363
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:42,557
So. Becky cannot stop talking about you.

364
00:28:42,557 --> 00:28:44,837
She's gonna die
when she finds out you were here.

365
00:28:44,837 --> 00:28:46,517
Excuse me. I have to go.

366
00:28:46,517 --> 00:28:52,679
I know it was only a couple of dates, but
Becky is really bummed you haven't called.

367
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:57,238
Next time you speak with her, tell her I'm
sorry, but I've taken myself off the market.

368
00:28:57,238 --> 00:28:59,958
Now I'm bummed.

369
00:28:59,958 --> 00:29:02,039
Thanks for coming.
I appreciate it. See you later.

370
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:04,880
Scott, this is Ellie Myers
from the Craig Kilborn show.

371
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,080
- Oh, hi. How are you?
- Hi. It's a pleasure to meet you.

372
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,240
<i>I've been a huge fan of yours
ever since Happy Days.</i>

373
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,760
Thank you. Listen. I appreciate you
meeting me here. I couldn't bail on tonight.

374
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,881
It's fine.

375
00:29:13,881 --> 00:29:15,801
You guys have a nice chat.
I'll be over here if you need me.

376
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:17,601
OK.

377
00:29:17,601 --> 00:29:20,321
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

378
00:29:20,321 --> 00:29:23,441
Craig is so excited
to have you on his show.

379
00:29:23,441 --> 00:29:27,682
I think it's gonna be
just a fabulous lineup.

380
00:29:27,682 --> 00:29:31,443
You'll be going on third,
after Ashton Kutcher and Carrot Top.

381
00:29:31,443 --> 00:29:33,283
- Third?
- Uh...

382
00:29:33,283 --> 00:29:35,323
I thought that we would start
with a Chachi clip,

383
00:29:35,323 --> 00:29:37,563
<i>and then move on
to something from Charles in Charge.</i>

384
00:29:37,563 --> 00:29:39,603
- Original.
- And, uh...

385
00:29:39,603 --> 00:29:42,884
and then we could...

386
00:29:42,884 --> 00:29:48,524
segue into what you're doing now.

387
00:29:48,524 --> 00:29:52,285
What are you doing now?

388
00:29:52,805 --> 00:29:56,685
You know, you're a beautiful girl.

389
00:29:56,685 --> 00:30:01,086
I mean, you've got this aura thing
happening. I...

390
00:30:01,086 --> 00:30:03,566
I just can't quite put my finger on it.

391
00:30:03,566 --> 00:30:06,086
Not when you can use your whole hand.

392
00:30:06,086 --> 00:30:09,847
Thank you. I think that's really
all we needed to discuss

393
00:30:09,847 --> 00:30:12,047
and I'll see you in the studio.

394
00:30:12,047 --> 00:30:15,447
- OK. You got it.
- OK.

395
00:30:20,048 --> 00:30:23,769
Wanna finish your drink?

396
00:30:23,769 --> 00:30:26,729
No. Bye.

397
00:30:26,809 --> 00:30:28,929
Okey-doke.

398
00:30:28,929 --> 00:30:30,529
Excuse me.

399
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:32,770
<i>- Hey, where are you going?
- Call us!</i>

400
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:34,610
Ellie.

401
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,450
Ellie, wait up.

402
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:39,251
Jake. I really don't feel well tonight.
I just wanna get home.

403
00:30:39,251 --> 00:30:43,810
Be careful with this one.
He's trouble.

404
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:47,851
- Who's the leopard?
- Someone I met before I met you.

405
00:30:47,851 --> 00:30:52,451
- They keep popping up, don't they?
- Ellie, that was a previous life.

406
00:30:52,492 --> 00:30:55,132
Please, you gotta trust me on this.

407
00:30:55,132 --> 00:30:58,173
You know what?
I think it's my turn to be weird.

408
00:30:58,173 --> 00:31:01,213
I'm gonna take a cue from you
and disappear for a few days.

409
00:31:01,213 --> 00:31:03,133
Ellie, people can change.

410
00:31:03,173 --> 00:31:07,654
I really don't wanna get into it right now.

411
00:34:22,756 --> 00:34:26,677
Close, close, close, close!

412
00:34:34,837 --> 00:34:37,717
Oh, my God.

413
00:34:42,358 --> 00:34:46,879
Hello? Hello? Anybody there?
Hello? Hello?

414
00:35:04,121 --> 00:35:07,721
Get me the fuck out of here!
Open up!

415
00:36:27,811 --> 00:36:31,491
- Hey.
- Hi.

416
00:36:35,932 --> 00:36:37,132
Are you doing homework?

417
00:36:37,132 --> 00:36:39,811
I'm just reading up
on how you kill a werewolf.

418
00:36:39,811 --> 00:36:41,212
Silver, right?

419
00:36:41,212 --> 00:36:45,972
No, you actually have to separate the head
from the heart. Silver just hurts a lot.

420
00:36:45,972 --> 00:36:48,093
It might not be such a bad deal.
Think about it.

421
00:36:48,133 --> 00:36:52,333
increased strength, heightened senses,
an unnatural sexual allure.

422
00:36:52,333 --> 00:36:54,694
When do we sprout hair and pointy ears?

423
00:36:54,694 --> 00:36:57,334
It's all a little sketchy,
but maybe never, maybe tomorrow.

424
00:36:57,334 --> 00:36:59,774
The experts can't really agree
on that one.

425
00:36:59,774 --> 00:37:03,294
You're starting to freak me out, Jimmy.
This is fiction. Myth.

426
00:37:03,294 --> 00:37:05,734
We live in reality.
Come back to the other side.

427
00:37:05,734 --> 00:37:10,295
I know, I know, but the line between
fiction and fact has always been a thin one.

428
00:37:10,295 --> 00:37:13,815
Don't we have enough problems? Do you
really wanna add this one to the list?

429
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:17,095
OK, here.
Check this out. Here.

430
00:37:17,095 --> 00:37:19,376
It's a five-pointed star.
It's a pentagram.

431
00:37:19,376 --> 00:37:21,776
It's the mark of the beast.

432
00:37:21,776 --> 00:37:24,577
Jimmy, this is ridiculous.
You need...

433
00:37:24,577 --> 00:37:27,817
Whoa. Jesus.

434
00:37:28,417 --> 00:37:32,178
Wait, is this for real?

435
00:37:32,217 --> 00:37:34,298
Last night was difficult, OK?

436
00:37:34,298 --> 00:37:37,338
The wreck, the girl dying,
it brought up a lot of stuff.

437
00:37:37,338 --> 00:37:39,979
- No, no, no, Ellie, don't start with that.
- I know we don't talk about it enough.

438
00:37:39,979 --> 00:37:44,979
- It has nothing to do with Mom and Dad.
- I miss them too.

439
00:37:45,499 --> 00:37:49,140
Your hand.
It's a creepy coincidence.

440
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:53,540
This is some pretty freaky shit.
Admit it.

441
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,461
OK. OK.

442
00:37:56,461 --> 00:38:00,101
Let's put it to the test.

443
00:38:01,981 --> 00:38:05,541
I bought this frame myself,
three years ago.

444
00:38:05,541 --> 00:38:08,342
It's from Tiffany's.
It's sterling silver.

445
00:38:08,342 --> 00:38:11,862
Now, if I'm a werewolf.
I shouldn't be able to pick it up, right?

446
00:38:11,862 --> 00:38:17,462
- It should hurt me, right?
- According to chapter four, yeah.

447
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:27,304
Go to bed, Jimmy.
It's late.

448
00:39:26,791 --> 00:39:29,991
Shut up!

449
00:39:32,551 --> 00:39:35,832
Shut up.

450
00:40:00,514 --> 00:40:03,515
Don't forget,
I'm working the opening of Tinsel tonight.

451
00:40:03,515 --> 00:40:08,556
- I've gotta take Craig down the red carpet.
- OK.

452
00:40:22,678 --> 00:40:25,278
Hello?

453
00:40:26,677 --> 00:40:29,198
Hey. Jake's been calling all morning.
Says he needs to talk.

454
00:40:29,198 --> 00:40:32,798
Well, I don't need to talk to him.
What's with the gypsies?

455
00:40:32,798 --> 00:40:37,199
Oh, it's auditions for Craig's sÃ©ance
segment. What is with this new look?

456
00:40:37,199 --> 00:40:43,400
- What are you talking about?
- I'm not complaining. I think you look hot.

457
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,080
- You're in danger.
- Excuse me?

458
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,281
It will come for you.

459
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:53,641
Don't let this getup fool you. I'm not a joke.
I've got the gift. I blame my mother.

460
00:40:53,641 --> 00:40:56,801
Why are you talking to me?

461
00:40:58,401 --> 00:41:00,802
You bear the markings of the beast.

462
00:41:00,802 --> 00:41:04,722
Look, I'm not trying to freak you out,
but you've been infected. You're cursed.

463
00:41:04,722 --> 00:41:07,562
You've got to sever the line of the beast.
It's the only way to break the curse.

464
00:41:07,562 --> 00:41:10,202
OK, all psychics
back in their seats, please.

465
00:41:10,202 --> 00:41:13,003
The beast is human too.
Don't forget that.

466
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:16,243
- And it's closer to you than you think.
- If you could just follow me.

467
00:41:16,243 --> 00:41:22,404
Shouldn't you psychically know
when you're annoying someone?

468
00:41:22,844 --> 00:41:25,724
Thank you.

469
00:41:25,724 --> 00:41:30,205
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Excuse me, Miss. Get up and get out.

470
00:41:30,205 --> 00:41:33,565
Look at him.

471
00:41:45,607 --> 00:41:48,568
Yeah!

472
00:42:04,649 --> 00:42:07,210
Oh, Brooke, hey.

473
00:42:07,210 --> 00:42:10,850
- Are you stalking me?
- Maybe.

474
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:15,370
What's going on, Brooke?
You going fruit fly on me?

475
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:20,010
Actually, we were just talking,
but, if you don't mind... Shoo.

476
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:21,891
Oh, you are asking for it. Abercrombie.

477
00:42:21,891 --> 00:42:23,931
Come on, Bo.
You're really becoming transparent.

478
00:42:23,931 --> 00:42:25,452
How about a little
identity intervention, OK?

479
00:42:25,452 --> 00:42:30,812
'Cause all this internalized homophobia's
giving you away.

480
00:42:31,012 --> 00:42:34,692
- You better watch your ass.
- What's going on?

481
00:42:34,692 --> 00:42:38,413
I'm just giving Jimmy some pointers.

482
00:42:38,413 --> 00:42:41,654
- He's here to try out for the team.
- Really? You?

483
00:42:41,654 --> 00:42:44,573
Are you sure
you want to do that, Jimmy?

484
00:42:44,573 --> 00:42:46,574
Oh, sure he does, coach.

485
00:42:46,574 --> 00:42:51,334
I'll tell you what.
I'll wrestle him.

486
00:42:53,654 --> 00:42:57,015
No, Louie, you and Jimmy take the mat.

487
00:42:57,015 --> 00:43:00,815
Jimmy, suit up.

488
00:43:01,816 --> 00:43:05,096
<i>He's so dead.</i>

489
00:43:07,016 --> 00:43:13,057
<i>OK. limp wrist, stay away from my groin.</i>

490
00:43:13,057 --> 00:43:17,497
<i>Take him down, Louie.
Take him down.</i>

491
00:43:24,618 --> 00:43:26,458
- Have you had enough?
- Uh-uh.

492
00:43:26,458 --> 00:43:28,858
<i>Let him up.</i>

493
00:43:28,858 --> 00:43:30,899
<i>Watch his nails, Lou!</i>

494
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:34,619
He might scratch your eyes out!

495
00:43:48,181 --> 00:43:51,421
- You OK, Lou?
- All right.

496
00:43:54,781 --> 00:43:57,222
- Let me take a crack, coach.
- Are you up for it, Jimmy?

497
00:43:57,222 --> 00:43:59,302
Yeah.

498
00:43:59,302 --> 00:44:02,543
Go for it, Bo.

499
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:13,784
- Come on, fairy. Shake your dust.
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?

500
00:44:15,544 --> 00:44:19,305
Come on, fag. What?
Do you like that? Huh?

501
00:44:22,265 --> 00:44:25,065
Wait, no...

502
00:44:45,187 --> 00:44:51,388
You know the best part about being a fairy?
You get to fly.

503
00:44:52,868 --> 00:44:58,869
Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy! Jimmy!

504
00:45:03,070 --> 00:45:05,709
- Ashton Kutcher's up first.
- God, he's so overexposed.

505
00:45:05,709 --> 00:45:08,950
Stick to his film career as talk points.
Don't linger on the TV stuff.

506
00:45:08,950 --> 00:45:14,551
And if he doesn't mention the Internet
sex scandal, just don't bring it up.

507
00:45:14,551 --> 00:45:16,991
OK, you know what?
I've done this before.

508
00:45:16,991 --> 00:45:19,272
- OK. I bump Baio.
- What?

509
00:45:19,311 --> 00:45:21,951
I'm living dangerously.
Carrot Top's rehearsal was funny.

510
00:45:21,951 --> 00:45:24,992
I'm gonna let the Top go long.
Randy's dealing with it.

511
00:45:24,992 --> 00:45:27,633
- OK.
- My mouth's dry.

512
00:45:27,633 --> 00:45:29,793
Thanks.

513
00:45:29,793 --> 00:45:32,992
- You want me to do that?
- I got it. Ouch. Dammit! Look.

514
00:45:32,992 --> 00:45:35,353
What happened?

515
00:45:35,353 --> 00:45:39,514
- Do you have a tissue?
- Just stare at it.

516
00:45:40,553 --> 00:45:43,514
<i>It's The Late Late Show
with Craig Kilborn.</i>

517
00:45:43,514 --> 00:45:46,234
OK. Go, Go! You're on.

518
00:45:46,234 --> 00:45:50,635
<i>Mr. Craig Kilborn.</i>

519
00:46:02,796 --> 00:46:05,717
Excuse me.
Excuse me, Ellie?

520
00:46:05,717 --> 00:46:08,237
What the fuck do you mean.
"Scott's been bumped?"

521
00:46:08,237 --> 00:46:11,197
- I just heard. We'll reschedule.
- Reschedule, my ass.

522
00:46:11,197 --> 00:46:13,958
- I'm sorry. The show was running long.
- Then bump Carrot Top.

523
00:46:13,958 --> 00:46:16,718
It's Scott Baio. He shouldn't be
going after Carrot Top anyway.

524
00:46:16,718 --> 00:46:18,278
- He should be first.
- I'll make it up to you.

525
00:46:18,278 --> 00:46:23,078
- Listen to me, you little...
- Don't start with me!

526
00:46:39,680 --> 00:46:43,441
Hi, Ellie.

527
00:46:51,761 --> 00:46:54,122
Are you OK in there?

528
00:46:54,122 --> 00:46:57,282
I'm fine.

529
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:03,283
You don't sound fine.

530
00:47:13,484 --> 00:47:17,045
What's the matter?

531
00:47:21,125 --> 00:47:23,646
Ellie?

532
00:47:23,646 --> 00:47:26,646
No!

533
00:47:32,086 --> 00:47:35,047
Ellie.

534
00:47:41,447 --> 00:47:45,448
Ellie, your hand.

535
00:47:54,969 --> 00:47:57,649
Ellie.

536
00:47:57,649 --> 00:47:59,809
What's wrong?

537
00:47:59,809 --> 00:48:03,690
I'm just having a really bad day.

538
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:07,011
Just leave.

539
00:48:08,251 --> 00:48:10,291
Can I help?

540
00:48:10,291 --> 00:48:14,572
Get the hell out of here! Get out!

541
00:48:36,454 --> 00:48:38,214
Hey, Jake.

542
00:48:38,214 --> 00:48:39,854
- Jimmy.
- Hey.

543
00:48:39,854 --> 00:48:42,174
Cool place.
Are all clubs like this?

544
00:48:42,174 --> 00:48:46,055
I sure hope not or I'm in big trouble.

545
00:48:46,055 --> 00:48:49,375
So what's up, Jimmy?
What are you doing here?

546
00:48:49,375 --> 00:48:54,456
Yeah. I... I kind of need someone
to talk to. Is that OK?

547
00:48:54,456 --> 00:48:57,576
Yeah, of course it is.
Step inside.

548
00:48:57,576 --> 00:49:03,577
OK, look. Ellie won't admit it, but ever since
the other night things have been different.

549
00:49:03,577 --> 00:49:05,657
- We're different.
- What night? What are you talking about?

550
00:49:05,657 --> 00:49:07,897
- Didn't Ellie tell you?
- No. Tell me what?

551
00:49:07,897 --> 00:49:12,578
We were in a wreck in the canyon.
A girl was killed.

552
00:49:12,578 --> 00:49:15,138
She was ripped apart.

553
00:49:15,138 --> 00:49:16,778
By...

554
00:49:16,778 --> 00:49:19,059
I don't know, by some kind of animal.

555
00:49:19,059 --> 00:49:22,139
Whatever it was bit me and now
things have been happening to me.

556
00:49:22,139 --> 00:49:25,060
Things I can't explain.
Jake, I know it sounds crazy.

557
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:28,460
but I think it was a...

558
00:49:28,460 --> 00:49:30,500
a werewolf.

559
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:33,340
Hm.

560
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:36,220
- What does your sister say about all this?
- You know Ellie.

561
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:40,381
Deny and avoid. It's her thing. But it got
her too and now I think we're cursed.

562
00:49:40,381 --> 00:49:42,301
Look, I almost
took a guy's head off in gym.

563
00:49:42,301 --> 00:49:46,781
I'm not the kind of guy to take
another guy's head off. I mean, look at me.

564
00:49:46,781 --> 00:49:49,542
What if it comes back?

565
00:49:49,542 --> 00:49:55,223
I mean, I know enough to know that it's
a who, not a what, so it could be pissed off.

566
00:49:55,223 --> 00:49:56,743
It may want to finish what it started.

567
00:49:56,743 --> 00:49:58,983
Jimmy, I think
you just need to calm down.

568
00:49:58,983 --> 00:50:02,303
I think the best thing we can do
is just call your sister.

569
00:50:02,303 --> 00:50:06,544
get her down here and maybe the three
of us should just sit down and discuss it.

570
00:50:06,544 --> 00:50:10,065
I don't want to discuss this. I've been
cursed. Something bad is gonna happen.

571
00:50:10,065 --> 00:50:11,985
I can... Look. I can feel it.

572
00:50:11,985 --> 00:50:15,706
Jimmy, listen to yourself.

573
00:50:15,706 --> 00:50:18,745
Werewolves?

574
00:50:20,226 --> 00:50:22,426
- This was a mistake. Sorry I bothered you.
- Jimmy.

575
00:50:22,426 --> 00:50:25,906
No, no. Thanks.

576
00:51:15,792 --> 00:51:19,593
Jesus Christ.

577
00:51:25,233 --> 00:51:30,474
- Bo, What are you doing here?
- I just wanted to, kind of, talk.

578
00:51:30,474 --> 00:51:34,394
About that stuff you said today.

579
00:51:35,955 --> 00:51:39,395
What stuff?

580
00:51:39,395 --> 00:51:42,235
About me.
I was just wondering how you knew.

581
00:51:42,235 --> 00:51:45,635
No one else did, just you.

582
00:51:45,635 --> 00:51:49,996
And I've been so shitty to you.
And then I thought.

583
00:51:49,996 --> 00:51:53,036
why wouldn't you know?
It takes one to know one, right?

584
00:51:53,036 --> 00:51:57,997
<i>- Of course, you would know.
- Know what?</i>

585
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:02,597
Whoa. Whoa.
What are you doing?

586
00:52:02,597 --> 00:52:04,878
I'm gay.

587
00:52:04,878 --> 00:52:09,559
I just can't keep it in anymore. I had to tell
you, you're the only other gay guy I know.

588
00:52:09,559 --> 00:52:12,638
Whoa. OK, stop. No. I'm not gay.
Not that there's anything wrong with it.

589
00:52:12,638 --> 00:52:17,879
- This is hard for me. Don't be like this.
- Trust me, Bo. I'm not gay, I'm cursed.

590
00:52:17,879 --> 00:52:21,640
I know. Sure feels like that, doesn't it?
Not being able to tell anyone.

591
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:24,280
- Talk to anyone about it.
- No, I'm cursed by the mark of the beast.

592
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:25,800
Bo.

593
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:29,360
I'm a werewolf.

594
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:33,161
Come on, Jimmy. You don't
have to pretend anymore. Not with me.

595
00:52:33,161 --> 00:52:37,721
N,. it's part of the curse. I'm appealing.
I have an unnatural sexual allure.

596
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,361
Yeah, yeah, you do. I know.

597
00:52:39,361 --> 00:52:42,042
Look, dude. I'm happy for you.
You be gay. It's a good thing.

598
00:52:42,042 --> 00:52:46,002
Unfortunately, I got my own shit
to take care of, so best of luck. Yay, go gay.

599
00:52:46,002 --> 00:52:49,403
And I'll see you.

600
00:52:49,403 --> 00:52:51,163
Hey. Jimmy, wait.

601
00:52:51,163 --> 00:52:53,763
Jimmy.

602
00:53:18,406 --> 00:53:21,847
<i>Liar.</i>

603
00:53:24,567 --> 00:53:27,207
Hey, Zipper.

604
00:53:27,207 --> 00:53:29,567
Hey.

605
00:53:35,088 --> 00:53:36,568
Hey.

606
00:53:36,568 --> 00:53:40,288
Hey, Zipper.
Hey, that's mine.

607
00:53:41,449 --> 00:53:44,169
Hey. Hey, Zipper. Drop it.

608
00:53:44,169 --> 00:53:46,530
Hey. No, drop it.

609
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:48,570
Zip.

610
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:52,210
Hey. Hey, come on.
Get out of it. Let's go.

611
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:55,370
No, Zipper!

612
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:57,810
Zipper.

613
00:54:07,492 --> 00:54:10,612
<i>Zipper.</i>

614
00:54:10,812 --> 00:54:12,932
- Bo, what are you doing here?
- We're not through yet.

615
00:54:12,932 --> 00:54:16,853
No, no, no.
We gotta go. Now.

616
00:54:16,933 --> 00:54:21,493
- Holy shit.
- Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, Go! Come on.

617
00:54:22,774 --> 00:54:26,134
Fuck me.

618
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:40,856
- What the fuck was that?
- That was my dog.

619
00:54:40,856 --> 00:54:43,296
- What kind of dog do you have?
- I have a regular dog.

620
00:54:43,296 --> 00:54:47,096
Or he was, until he bit me.
I infected him.

621
00:54:47,096 --> 00:54:49,976
- I told you. I'm a werewolf.
- Oh, yeah. Right.

622
00:54:49,976 --> 00:54:53,297
Look, I gotta find my sister.
Give me your cellphone.

623
00:54:53,297 --> 00:54:58,378
Thanks, I know. Just keep your eyes on the
road, all right? Animals, they sometimes...

624
00:55:02,698 --> 00:55:05,898
Shit. Stupid canyons. Look,
she's going to a club opening, at Tinsel.

625
00:55:05,898 --> 00:55:10,139
- Oh, on the strip. Got it. I'm with you.
- OK. All right, settle down.

626
00:55:16,380 --> 00:55:20,140
<i>...killed 23 people
and wounded more than 100 on Saturday.</i>

627
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:24,221
<i>In breaking news,

628
00:55:24,221 --> 00:55:26,621
<i>Another woman,

631

632
00:55:37,542 --> 00:55:40,222
I'll drink, you can drive.

633
00:55:40,222 --> 00:55:42,183
Ready?

634
00:55:42,183 --> 00:55:47,223
Kyle, can you cover for me tonight?
I've gotta get home.

635
00:55:47,223 --> 00:55:49,543
You're gonna miss Jake's big opening?

636
00:55:49,543 --> 00:55:53,463
- Ellie?
- I guess.

637
00:55:57,145 --> 00:56:01,185
- Good night, Ellie.
- Oh, good night.

638
00:56:12,146 --> 00:56:14,147
Ellie.

639
00:56:14,147 --> 00:56:17,387
Ellie, please.

640
00:56:22,027 --> 00:56:23,987
You scared me.

641
00:56:23,987 --> 00:56:27,227
I'm sorry,
but I needed to talk to you, Ellie.

642
00:56:27,227 --> 00:56:29,588
You haven't been returning my calls.

643
00:56:29,588 --> 00:56:33,268
You knew those girls, Becky and Jenny.

644
00:56:33,268 --> 00:56:35,789
They're both dead.

645
00:56:35,789 --> 00:56:39,670
I know, but, Ellie.
I can explain everything.

646
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:42,390
Ellie!

647
00:56:42,390 --> 00:56:46,110
Ellie. Ellie!

648
00:56:57,391 --> 00:57:01,152
Get out of the car, Ellie.

649
00:57:01,992 --> 00:57:05,152
Please.

650
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,953
Look, I'm sorry about your window.
I didn't mean to do that.

651
00:57:12,953 --> 00:57:16,753
but I have a lot of things
that I have to explain to you

652
00:57:16,753 --> 00:57:21,874
and they're all going to sound a little crazy
so I just need you to hear me out.

653
00:57:21,874 --> 00:57:25,234
Give me back my keys first.

654
00:57:32,675 --> 00:57:35,636
What attacked you in the canyon
wasn't just an animal.

655
00:57:35,636 --> 00:57:39,796
- What was it?
- You already know the answer to that.

656
00:57:39,836 --> 00:57:43,157
You can feel the changes, can't you?

657
00:57:46,236 --> 00:57:49,557
Ellie!

658
00:58:06,199 --> 00:58:10,919
How's it going? These are my plus-ones
right here, all the way to the end, there.

659
00:58:10,919 --> 00:58:13,120
Hey, man.

660
00:58:13,120 --> 00:58:16,280
- Hey, Bo. can I use your cell?
- Uh, yeah. Sure.

661
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:21,681
Hey. I'm gonna go look,
see if anybody's seen your sister.

662
00:58:27,722 --> 00:58:29,161
- Hello?
- Ellie?

663
00:58:29,161 --> 00:58:32,122
<i>- Jimmy, thank God. Where are you?
- I'm at Tinsel.</i>

664
00:58:32,122 --> 00:58:33,322
<i>- What?
- No, it's OK.</i>

665
00:58:33,322 --> 00:58:35,602
What are you doing there?
I'm on my way home.

666
00:58:35,602 --> 00:58:38,323
Ellie, don't go home. Look,
I infected Zipper and he's gone werewolf.

667
00:58:38,323 --> 00:58:41,683
- You gotta believe me. Look, it's all true.
- I believe you, OK?

668
00:58:41,723 --> 00:58:43,763
I'd believe anything at this point.

669
00:58:43,763 --> 00:58:45,923
- Jimmy, it's Jake.
- What? Jake?

670
00:58:45,923 --> 00:58:47,964
<i>He's the one who attacked us.
He's the werewolf.</i>

671
00:58:47,964 --> 00:58:51,724
- Ellie, I'm freaking out.
- Kyle should be there, OK? Just find him.

672
00:58:51,724 --> 00:58:54,684
Stay low.
Jake is definitely gonna be there.

673
00:58:54,684 --> 00:58:58,165
I'll be there as soon as I can.

674
00:59:04,565 --> 00:59:08,927
Jimmy. Have you seen Ellie?
I just really need to find her, right away.

675
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:11,046
- Jake. Hi.
- Hi.

676
00:59:11,046 --> 00:59:12,926
- The place looks amazing.
- Thank you.

677
00:59:12,926 --> 00:59:15,607
- Incredible. Congratulations. Excuse me.
- Wait, Jimmy. I really need to...

678
00:59:15,607 --> 00:59:18,528
Did I introduce you to Scott?
Scott, this is Jake.

679
00:59:18,528 --> 00:59:20,808
- Hey, man. How are you doing?
- Good, thanks. Thanks for coming.

680
00:59:20,808 --> 00:59:23,968
Can I excuse myself for one second?

681
00:59:23,968 --> 00:59:26,609
- Jimmy?

682
00:59:29,849 --> 00:59:32,809
- Find your sister?
- No, actually...

683
00:59:32,809 --> 00:59:35,609
- Oh, shit. Shit. Shit.
- What? Is he a werewolf hunter?

684
00:59:35,609 --> 00:59:36,770
No, no. He's trouble.

685
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:39,610
Tell the guys to look out for a young guy,
about yea tall, brown hair.

686
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:40,770
He's a little jumpy so be discreet.

687
00:59:40,770 --> 00:59:44,410
Here, come on.
I think we can cut through here.

688
00:59:44,410 --> 00:59:48,330
Come on. Come on.
we can get out the back way. Come on.

689
00:59:53,011 --> 00:59:54,852
Kyle.

690
00:59:54,852 --> 00:59:56,852
Kyle.

691
00:59:56,852 --> 00:59:59,452
- Kyle. Have you seen my brother?
- Jimmy's here?

692
00:59:59,452 --> 01:00:02,813
- I've gotta find him, it's an emergency.
- Ellie, you need to tell me what's going on.

693
01:00:02,813 --> 01:00:06,173
- I wish I could.
- Hey, have you seen Kilborn?

694
01:00:06,173 --> 01:00:10,173
He ditched me.

695
01:00:21,094 --> 01:00:24,535
<i>- ... out of here, baby.
- Hold on. Find me...</i>

696
01:00:24,535 --> 01:00:25,935
<i>Help!</i>

697
01:00:25,935 --> 01:00:30,335
<i>- Which way is out?
- I don't know. Here. Come on, come on.</i>

698
01:00:32,456 --> 01:00:36,536
<i>- Bo, over here.
- Jimmy?</i>

699
01:00:36,857 --> 01:00:39,737
<i>Ellie.</i>

700
01:00:40,176 --> 01:00:43,137
- Please, Ellie. Don't be afraid.
- Stay away from me, Jake.

701
01:00:43,137 --> 01:00:47,057
<i>- But it wasn't me.
- Bullshit. I saw your hands.</i>

702
01:00:47,057 --> 01:00:49,738
<i>- There's another one like me.
- Is that your sister?</i>

703
01:00:49,738 --> 01:00:51,858
<i>- I think so.
- I don't know who it is.</i>

704
01:00:51,858 --> 01:00:55,298
But that's who killed those girls.
It's trying to get to me.

705
01:00:55,298 --> 01:00:58,619
Please, you have to believe me.
I'm telling you the truth.

706
01:00:59,539 --> 01:01:03,980
- I don't know what to believe.
- Ellie, I was born with this curse.

707
01:01:03,980 --> 01:01:07,780
I know how to control it.

708
01:01:07,780 --> 01:01:11,660
I've learned to live with something terrible.
Just like you.

709
01:01:11,660 --> 01:01:14,101
We're not that different.

710
01:01:14,101 --> 01:01:16,301
- We can do this.
- How do you know that?

711
01:01:16,301 --> 01:01:18,621
Because, Ellie.

712
01:01:18,621 --> 01:01:20,582
- I love you.
- No!

713
01:01:20,582 --> 01:01:22,502
- Please.
- Ellie. Come on.

714
01:01:22,502 --> 01:01:23,661
Ellie.

715
01:01:23,661 --> 01:01:26,102
I love you.

716
01:01:26,102 --> 01:01:29,022
Please.

717
01:01:33,543 --> 01:01:36,583
<i>Jake!</i>

718
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:44,464
Where is it?
Where are they?

719
01:01:58,866 --> 01:02:02,906
<i>- Go! Go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Shit!</i>

720
01:02:03,306 --> 01:02:07,347
- OK, you go that way. I'll go this way.
- OK.

721
01:02:07,627 --> 01:02:10,587
<i>- Bo?
- Bo? Bo? Bo? Bo? Bo?</i>

722
01:02:10,587 --> 01:02:12,347
Bo?

723
01:02:12,347 --> 01:02:14,388
No, don't go in there.
It's not safe.

724
01:02:14,388 --> 01:02:17,508
No. Stop.

725
01:02:17,508 --> 01:02:22,108
Randy. Randy, you gotta get everyone
out of there and you gotta radio for help.

726
01:02:22,108 --> 01:02:24,828
Why?

727
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:39,310
Are you OK?
Come on, get up.

728
01:02:39,310 --> 01:02:41,830
- Ellie!
- Jimmy.

729
01:02:41,830 --> 01:02:45,431
<i>Come on.
It's a fucking werewolf.</i>

730
01:02:53,272 --> 01:02:55,752
Jimmy!

731
01:02:57,112 --> 01:02:59,073
- Have you seen my brother?
- He must be out front.

732
01:02:59,073 --> 01:03:01,793
No, he's not. I've looked everywhere.
He's not out there.

733
01:03:01,793 --> 01:03:03,433
<i>There's nobody left in there except for...</i>

734
01:03:03,433 --> 01:03:06,033
...that!

735
01:03:06,273 --> 01:03:08,753
Jimmy!

736
01:03:10,114 --> 01:03:13,515
Jimmy!

737
01:03:21,596 --> 01:03:24,756
Jimmy.

738
01:03:34,037 --> 01:03:36,637
Jimmy.

739
01:03:36,637 --> 01:03:37,837
- Are you OK?
- Yeah.

740
01:03:37,837 --> 01:03:41,718
- OK. We gotta get outta here.
- I know.

741
01:03:42,678 --> 01:03:45,478
- Ellie.
- Kyle, what...

742
01:03:45,478 --> 01:03:47,438
What the hell's happening?

743
01:03:47,438 --> 01:03:52,039
I heard people screaming,
and then I lost Craig. I lost Craig.

744
01:03:52,039 --> 01:03:55,639
- Stay away from us.
- What? Why?

745
01:03:55,639 --> 01:03:59,079
Show me your hand.

746
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:02,840
- The other hand.
- Ellie.

747
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:05,000
we don't have time for this.

748
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:10,441
There's an animal on the loose.
It could be anywhere.

749
01:04:12,801 --> 01:04:16,921
What? You guys hear something?

750
01:04:23,282 --> 01:04:27,843
- Where the fuck did he go?
- I don't know.

751
01:04:32,003 --> 01:04:34,964
Jimmy?

752
01:04:38,564 --> 01:04:40,004
Come on.

753
01:04:40,004 --> 01:04:41,764
- Come on, come on. Keep going.
- But it's closed.

754
01:04:41,764 --> 01:04:44,005
- Shit. We can't get out. We're fucked.
- Where are we going?

755
01:04:44,005 --> 01:04:48,925
I don't know. Shit.
Where does this go? Come on.

756
01:04:49,565 --> 01:04:54,846
- Shit.
- There should be doors. Look for a door.

757
01:04:55,766 --> 01:05:00,246
- There's nothing. Look over there.
- OK.

758
01:05:02,446 --> 01:05:06,408
No, they're not here.

759
01:05:07,167 --> 01:05:09,207
- Weren't there three?
- What?

760
01:05:09,207 --> 01:05:11,247
There's three microphones.
There's only two...

761
01:05:11,247 --> 01:05:14,728
Jimmy!

762
01:05:16,409 --> 01:05:20,249
- Showtime. Isn't that what they say?
- Joannie.

763
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:22,969
Just for the record. I didn't ask for this.

764
01:05:22,969 --> 01:05:26,489
It was just a hot night
with the guy that every girl in town wanted.

765
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:29,130
Lucky me.
I should've been more careful though.

766
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:34,570
I got a little rough in bed and wound up
cursed by the mark of the fucking beast.

767
01:05:34,570 --> 01:05:38,851
- That Jake, he's a catch.
- Oh, my God.

768
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:42,531
I thought he was the one, you know, but all
I got was a couple of dates, some hot sex,

769
01:05:42,531 --> 01:05:46,852
and a "I'm not ready for a relationship
right now. It's not you. it's me. "

770
01:05:46,852 --> 01:05:49,692
Men. They're all beasts.

771
01:05:49,692 --> 01:05:54,133
Jake didn't want me.
And if I can't have him...

772
01:05:54,133 --> 01:05:57,893
- Well, you know how that line goes.
- Hey. I...

773
01:06:02,894 --> 01:06:05,334
The funny thing is.
I never saw you as a threat.

774
01:06:05,334 --> 01:06:08,854
I find you rather depressing myself.

775
01:06:08,854 --> 01:06:14,335
Why do men always go for
the tortured ones? Poor damaged Ellie.

776
01:06:15,895 --> 01:06:19,135
<i>Bitch!</i>

777
01:06:21,176 --> 01:06:24,536
Who's lost it now?

778
01:06:35,657 --> 01:06:40,938
OK. Just the two of us. Fair fight, OK?
Just me and you. All right? Come on.

779
01:06:40,938 --> 01:06:43,499
- OK.
- I'm right here.

780
01:06:43,499 --> 01:06:46,858
OK. Let's go.

781
01:06:48,979 --> 01:06:52,779
Fair fight?
This is Hollywood.

782
01:06:52,779 --> 01:06:54,220
And you...

783
01:06:54,220 --> 01:06:58,220
You get one taste of blood
and you freak out.

784
01:07:00,941 --> 01:07:04,581
Jimmy. Jimmy.

785
01:07:23,903 --> 01:07:27,103
Come on, run.

786
01:07:41,465 --> 01:07:45,465
Jake? You bounce back quickly.

787
01:07:45,465 --> 01:07:48,266
Hi.

788
01:07:48,386 --> 01:07:52,866
- It's you?
- Yeah.

789
01:07:52,866 --> 01:07:55,986
- How did this happen, Joannie?
- Well.

790
01:07:55,986 --> 01:08:02,627
I guess there's no such thing
as safe sex with a werewolf.

791
01:08:04,268 --> 01:08:09,228
Joannie, it doesn't have to be like this
for you. There are ways for you to control it.

792
01:08:09,228 --> 01:08:12,509
Like what? Nibbling on coyotes
in the desert? No thanks.

793
01:08:12,509 --> 01:08:14,869
I'm having too much fun
eliminating the competition.

794
01:08:14,869 --> 01:08:18,509
Pretty soon I'll have you all to myself.

795
01:08:18,509 --> 01:08:22,390
I won't let you kill her, Joannie.

796
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:23,590
Jake!

797
01:08:23,590 --> 01:08:25,590
Honey, muffin.

798
01:08:25,590 --> 01:08:28,350
I am not gonna kill her. I promise.

799
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:32,311
I'm just gonna rip her to shreds
and let her choke on her own blood.

800
01:08:32,311 --> 01:08:33,791
Then...

801
01:08:33,830 --> 01:08:35,751
maybe I'll eat her.

802
01:08:35,751 --> 01:08:39,672
You have to kill me first.

803
01:08:42,992 --> 01:08:45,473
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

804
01:08:45,473 --> 01:08:52,193
Well, I've learned a few things about
this curse along the way, and I know better.

805
01:08:52,513 --> 01:08:58,594
But that doesn't mean
I can't make it hurt a little.

806
01:09:09,435 --> 01:09:13,395
- I don't see her.
- Sh.

807
01:09:26,677 --> 01:09:29,837
Ellie?

808
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:46,599
Let's see how she deals with these.

809
01:09:49,680 --> 01:09:52,400
<i>I'm gonna get you.</i>

810
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:55,640
Where are you, you bitch?

811
01:09:55,640 --> 01:09:59,641
Get this off!

812
01:10:04,762 --> 01:10:08,962
Where's your brother?

813
01:10:50,047 --> 01:10:53,367
- Where'd she go?
- I don't know.

814
01:10:53,367 --> 01:10:56,768
<i>Well, maybe she left.</i>

815
01:10:56,768 --> 01:11:00,367
Or maybe not.

816
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:14,609
- Did she see us?
- I don't think...

817
01:11:14,609 --> 01:11:18,570
Run! Jimmy, get out of here.

818
01:11:21,130 --> 01:11:24,210
Jimmy!

819
01:11:37,932 --> 01:11:40,893
Ellie.

820
01:11:56,014 --> 01:11:58,615
Ellie, wake up.

821
01:12:00,815 --> 01:12:04,015
Wake up.

822
01:12:23,817 --> 01:12:25,937
You're playing with us,
aren't you, Joannie?

823
01:12:25,937 --> 01:12:28,338
Ellie.

824
01:12:28,338 --> 01:12:31,658
Well, play this!

825
01:12:41,659 --> 01:12:44,540
<i>- Let's go!
- Let's go!</i>

826
01:12:44,540 --> 01:12:45,979
- Move along. Let's go.
- Yes, sir.

827
01:12:45,979 --> 01:12:48,260
<i>Shit!</i>

828
01:12:56,341 --> 01:12:57,901
Move it.

829
01:12:57,901 --> 01:13:00,062
- Freeze!
- Don't shoot.

830
01:13:00,062 --> 01:13:03,982
- Where's the animal?
- It's up there somewhere.

831
01:13:03,982 --> 01:13:06,943
<i>- What's it supposed to be?
- I don't know. Stay alert, guys.</i>

832
01:13:06,943 --> 01:13:12,383
- What the hell is it, anyway?
- Oh, it's a werewolf. What?

833
01:13:12,383 --> 01:13:15,263
- Did you say werewolf?
- Yeah.

834
01:13:15,263 --> 01:13:17,464
She may have changed back
to her human form.

835
01:13:17,464 --> 01:13:22,424
Her name is Joannie.
She's this hyper, skinny publicist.

836
01:13:22,424 --> 01:13:25,784
- Any other description?
- Yeah. She's, what? Like, five foot seven?

837
01:13:25,784 --> 01:13:28,705
She's got a bony ass.

838
01:13:28,705 --> 01:13:32,105
and fat thighs, and bad skin.

839
01:13:32,105 --> 01:13:36,065
<i>Liar!</i>

840
01:13:37,025 --> 01:13:39,946
Shoot!

841
01:13:46,186 --> 01:13:50,428
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!

842
01:14:02,788 --> 01:14:06,909
- Man, that's ugly.
- Careful.

843
01:14:07,189 --> 01:14:10,909
It's dead. All clear.

844
01:14:10,909 --> 01:14:12,870
- That's fucked up.
- Yeah. OK.

845
01:14:12,870 --> 01:14:15,790
- Stand down.
- What is this thing?

846
01:14:15,790 --> 01:14:20,191
I told you. It's a werewolf.
You have to separate the head from the...

847
01:14:24,111 --> 01:14:26,031
Repeat, all clear.

848
01:14:26,031 --> 01:14:29,392
Call animal control.

849
01:14:29,392 --> 01:14:31,992
<i>- Get them out of here.
- Is she dead?</i>

850
01:14:31,992 --> 01:14:36,032
Yeah. Her brain's on the floor.
That should do it.

851
01:14:36,032 --> 01:14:38,713
- Jake.
- Bo.

852
01:14:38,713 --> 01:14:42,633
Hey. I need a paramedic in here.

853
01:14:47,233 --> 01:14:49,554
Bo. Bo. Bo.

854
01:14:49,554 --> 01:14:52,994
- Yeah.
- Are you OK?

855
01:14:53,675 --> 01:14:57,275
- Hey, Jimbo. How'd I do?
- You did good.

856
01:14:57,275 --> 01:14:59,755
- I'm gonna go look for Jake, OK?
- Yeah.

857
01:14:59,755 --> 01:15:01,876
Hey, you good?

858
01:15:01,876 --> 01:15:05,316
Yeah. He sucker-punched me.
I was about to kick his ass.

859
01:15:05,316 --> 01:15:08,556
OK.

860
01:15:14,557 --> 01:15:17,798
Did you find him?

861
01:15:17,798 --> 01:15:21,038
No.

862
01:15:25,198 --> 01:15:28,239
- I'm telling you, we shot the shit out of this.
- Really?

863
01:15:28,239 --> 01:15:31,958
You're gonna need a forklift.
This thing is...

864
01:15:31,958 --> 01:15:35,519
huge.

865
01:15:53,121 --> 01:15:55,321
- Are you OK?
- Are you all right?

866
01:15:55,321 --> 01:15:58,962
- I think so.
- Yeah.

867
01:16:00,722 --> 01:16:03,682
So, it's over, right?

868
01:16:03,682 --> 01:16:07,043
And Joannie's dead, so we're OK now.

869
01:16:07,043 --> 01:16:12,084
Well, that's subjective. We still have
to go back to our pathetic precurse lives.

870
01:16:12,084 --> 01:16:17,444
- I'm personally OK with that.
- Well, you're not in high school.

871
01:16:22,285 --> 01:16:24,685
What happened?

872
01:16:24,685 --> 01:16:27,086
Zipper.

873
01:16:41,127 --> 01:16:44,007
Are you OK?

874
01:16:44,007 --> 01:16:47,407
I will be.

875
01:16:47,567 --> 01:16:51,008
What's wrong?
Are you worried about Jake?

876
01:16:51,008 --> 01:16:54,328
- His secret's out. He had to disappear.
- I don't want to talk about it, OK?

877
01:16:54,328 --> 01:16:56,689
I know you think he's a good guy, Ellie,
but don't forget, all of this.

878
01:16:56,689 --> 01:16:59,169
everything we've been through,
is because of him.

879
01:16:59,169 --> 01:17:00,729
When it comes down to it,
a monster is still a monster.

880
01:17:00,729 --> 01:17:04,530
Jimmy. That's enough.

881
01:17:04,609 --> 01:17:07,690
I guess some things never change.

882
01:17:07,690 --> 01:17:14,290
- Do you think you can get us some light?
- Yeah. Yeah. I'll check the circuit breaker.

883
01:17:24,412 --> 01:17:27,652
Zipper?

884
01:17:37,613 --> 01:17:42,734
- How are you doing with those lights?
- Yeah, one second.

885
01:17:42,734 --> 01:17:43,854
Shit.

886
01:17:43,854 --> 01:17:46,254
Is everything OK down there?

887
01:17:46,254 --> 01:17:50,135
Yeah, it's fine. I just...

888
01:18:39,260 --> 01:18:42,541
Thank you.

889
01:19:27,026 --> 01:19:30,227
Zipper?

890
01:19:34,547 --> 01:19:36,546
<i>It's OK. It's just me.</i>

891
01:19:36,546 --> 01:19:41,748
Sorry. I'm still working on the fuses. It's
a little dark in here. I'll be up in a minute.

892
01:19:41,748 --> 01:19:43,827
Jake.

893
01:19:43,827 --> 01:19:45,988
How are you, Ellie?

894
01:19:45,988 --> 01:19:49,389
Jake, something's wrong. I'm...

895
01:19:49,389 --> 01:19:51,029
<i>Sh.</i>

896
01:19:51,029 --> 01:19:54,189
It'll be OK. Just breathe.
You'll be OK.

897
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:58,909
- What's happening to me?
- It's starting, Ellie.

898
01:19:58,949 --> 01:20:01,550
- It's almost midnight.
- Oh, no.

899
01:20:01,550 --> 01:20:02,710
No.

900
01:20:02,710 --> 01:20:04,830
- This can't happen, Jake.
- Ellie.

901
01:20:04,830 --> 01:20:07,190
Ellie, sh. It's OK.
You're gonna be OK.

902
01:20:07,190 --> 01:20:09,271
- I came back for you.
- I have to stop it.

903
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:12,511
- You have to help me stop it.
- Ellie, it's not really that simple.

904
01:20:12,511 --> 01:20:14,951
But you have nothing to worry about.
This is how we can be together.

905
01:20:14,951 --> 01:20:16,832
You need this, Ellie.

906
01:20:16,832 --> 01:20:20,512
You need me.

907
01:20:23,632 --> 01:20:25,552
- You said it could be controlled.
- You don't have to worry.

908
01:20:25,552 --> 01:20:28,873
I can teach you how to live with this.
And we have years to figure it out.

909
01:20:28,873 --> 01:20:32,313
So that's your answer?
We live happily ever after?

910
01:20:32,313 --> 01:20:35,354
There's no reason why we can't now.

911
01:20:39,394 --> 01:20:41,395
Think about it.
Your parents are dead,

912
01:20:41,395 --> 01:20:43,514
your brother is miserable,
your life is a mess.

913
01:20:43,514 --> 01:20:46,395
Why do you think it is
that you fell for me so hard and so fast?

914
01:20:46,395 --> 01:20:50,036
I gave you a reason to live again, Ellie.
And I can still do that for you.

915
01:20:50,036 --> 01:20:53,235
- Jake, I don't want this.
- It's the only way we can be together, Ellie.

916
01:20:53,235 --> 01:20:57,716
But I don't want you.
Tell me how to get rid of it. Tell me how!

917
01:20:57,716 --> 01:21:01,677
The only way you can break the curse
is for the one who started it all to die.

918
01:21:01,677 --> 01:21:04,037
And that's me.

919
01:21:04,037 --> 01:21:08,077
- I'm not ready to die just yet.
- I can't let my brother live like this.

920
01:21:08,077 --> 01:21:11,718
You know I have to think of him first.

921
01:21:11,718 --> 01:21:16,399
I know. I bet you promised your parents
that you'd give him a good life, didn't you?

922
01:21:16,399 --> 01:21:19,998
But you know what, Ellie? You're
really not doing a very good job, are you?

923
01:21:19,998 --> 01:21:24,719
- In fact, you're kind of a disaster.
- Get away from me.

924
01:21:32,800 --> 01:21:35,200
I don't want you
to worry about your brother, OK?

925
01:21:35,200 --> 01:21:37,801
After all,
there's only room for one alpha male.

926
01:21:37,801 --> 01:21:41,121
And I really think we should put
the poor kid out of his misery, don't you?

927
01:21:41,121 --> 01:21:44,642
Where is that brother of yours, anyway?

928
01:21:45,081 --> 01:21:47,922
Now, where could he be?

929
01:21:47,922 --> 01:21:51,162
In the basement?

930
01:21:51,322 --> 01:21:54,363
These heightened senses
are a kick, huh?

931
01:21:59,163 --> 01:22:01,283
No hard feelings, buddy.

932
01:22:01,283 --> 01:22:05,243
I'll make it as quick as possible.

933
01:22:13,405 --> 01:22:17,525
- Take it easy with the silver, Ellie.
- You're a monster.

934
01:22:17,525 --> 01:22:21,326
Join the club.

935
01:22:30,687 --> 01:22:34,127
That's only the beginning, Ellie.

936
01:22:34,728 --> 01:22:38,888
I should've known
you couldn't handle this.

937
01:22:39,088 --> 01:22:42,728
You're too weak to think you could
survive it. It only makes you stronger.

938
01:22:42,728 --> 01:22:46,209
But you're too stupid, too timid.

939
01:22:58,570 --> 01:23:00,610
It comes and goes at first.

940
01:23:00,610 --> 01:23:03,130
I probably should've told you that.

941
01:23:03,130 --> 01:23:07,971
- Unfortunately now you both have to die.
- Hey!

942
01:23:28,454 --> 01:23:32,294
You'd better run, you little shit.

943
01:23:33,214 --> 01:23:37,054
I am going to kill you.

944
01:24:36,701 --> 01:24:41,342
Like you said, what doesn't kill you...

945
01:25:36,988 --> 01:25:39,788
It's over.

946
01:25:39,788 --> 01:25:45,109
Are you sure? You were a little off on
that whole "how to break the curse" thing.

947
01:25:45,109 --> 01:25:48,150
Yeah, well, the books
kind of glossed over that part.

948
01:25:48,150 --> 01:25:51,309
Uh-huh.

949
01:25:57,670 --> 01:26:01,111
We're going to be OK.

950
01:26:05,351 --> 01:26:08,632
Zipper.

951
01:26:11,752 --> 01:26:14,753
Brooke.

952
01:26:14,753 --> 01:26:18,153
- What are you doing here?
- Hey, Jimmy.

953
01:26:18,153 --> 01:26:23,234
I found your dog.
He was wandering the streets.

954
01:26:23,234 --> 01:26:28,434
- How'd you know where I lived?
- I told her.

955
01:26:30,994 --> 01:26:33,115
<i>- Are you OK?
- Yeah, you?</i>

956
01:26:33,115 --> 01:26:35,074
I'm good, thanks.

957
01:26:35,074 --> 01:26:36,075
Uh...

958
01:26:36,075 --> 01:26:40,035
- Can I walk you home?
- Sure.

959
01:27:01,918 --> 01:27:04,638
- Are you coming?
- Yeah.

960
01:27:04,638 --> 01:27:07,919
See you later.

961
01:27:07,919 --> 01:27:09,999
- Nice moves.
- It's the new me.

962
01:27:09,999 --> 01:27:15,719
I'm just gonna stay here.
And, uh... clean.

963
01:27:28,321 --> 01:27:31,801
Come on, Zipper.
