2
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:14,013
Sharkboy was not always
half shark, half boy.

3
00:01:14,087 --> 00:01:18,456
He was a marine biologist -
or, at least, in training.

4
00:01:18,525 --> 00:01:21,016
His father studied great white sharks

5
00:01:21,094 --> 00:01:26,532
and called his son "Sharkboy" because of
how much he loved to care for the sharks.

6
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,434
He made them sushi
and had given them all names.'

7
00:01:30,504 --> 00:01:34,235
Goodmilk, Peggy, Eggbat...

8
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:37,066
and Crackett.

9
00:01:41,181 --> 00:01:45,550
But one day
an incredible, mysterious storm appeared.

10
00:01:46,086 --> 00:01:48,520
It swept away the entire laboratory.

11
00:01:48,588 --> 00:01:49,714
Sharkboy!

12
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:53,851
Thanks to their life rafts,
Sharkboy and his father survived.

13
00:01:53,927 --> 00:01:56,828
But they survived
on different sides of the wreckage,

14
00:01:56,897 --> 00:01:59,161
each floating off in a different direction.

15
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:00,563
Sharkboy!

16
00:02:00,634 --> 00:02:03,933
Sharkboy was completely alone.

17
00:02:06,273 --> 00:02:08,764
Almost completely.

18
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:12,742
But one of the sharks recognized him.

19
00:02:12,813 --> 00:02:14,610
Hey, is Sharkboy,

20
00:02:14,681 --> 00:02:18,378
Don't take a bite outta him, boys -
he's a friend,

21
00:02:19,085 --> 00:02:24,990
They took Sharkboy to their cave home,
where he'd be safe and dry.

22
00:02:28,128 --> 00:02:30,995
His new family were sharks.

23
00:02:33,867 --> 00:02:36,802
Hundreds of sharks.

24
00:02:41,675 --> 00:02:44,405
The sharks raised him
as one of their own,

25
00:02:44,478 --> 00:02:47,311
training him in the ways of the shark.

26
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:50,042
You must keep moving to survive,

27
00:02:50,116 --> 00:02:52,949
Always go forward, never back,

28
00:02:53,954 --> 00:02:57,515
To live by instinct and instinct alone.

29
00:03:01,595 --> 00:03:06,464
Eventually he grew gills,
and sharp talons for claws.

30
00:03:06,533 --> 00:03:09,195
His teeth sharpened themselves
to a point.

31
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:14,297
He grew fins - all sorts of fins.

32
00:03:14,374 --> 00:03:16,569
But that was years ago.

33
00:03:16,643 --> 00:03:21,239
I first met Sharkboy
while fishing on the dock this summer.

34
00:03:31,558 --> 00:03:33,958
He seemed lost.

35
00:03:34,027 --> 00:03:36,757
- You have to get a job!
- No, I have a job!

36
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:39,799
So I snuck him home...

37
00:03:39,866 --> 00:03:42,130
Then maybe you should just leave,

38
00:03:42,202 --> 00:03:45,194
...when my parents
were too busy to notice.

39
00:03:47,507 --> 00:03:50,738
I kept him fed and in water.

40
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:56,071
He had been traveling the universe
in search of his father.

41
00:03:56,149 --> 00:04:02,349
He told me of his latest adventures
on a planet so cool it makes you drool.

42
00:04:02,956 --> 00:04:07,154
He said I too
could go to Planet Drool someday.

43
00:04:08,128 --> 00:04:12,224
Then one night
I was visited by a glowing light.

44
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:17,862
An amazing girl with purple flames for hair
and skin of molten lava rock appeared.

45
00:04:17,938 --> 00:04:19,428
I called her...

46
00:04:19,506 --> 00:04:21,474
Lavagirl,

47
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:25,068
She smiled at me,
for that seemed to be her name.

48
00:04:25,145 --> 00:04:29,241
She told me she needed Sharkboy
to return to Planet Drool with her,

49
00:04:29,316 --> 00:04:31,944
for a great crisis was developing.

50
00:04:32,018 --> 00:04:37,285
She asked if I could go with them.
I told her, "I have school tomorrow."

51
00:04:37,357 --> 00:04:41,157
She gave me a sad look
and flamed away,

52
00:04:41,227 --> 00:04:43,695
taking Sharkboy with her.

53
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:49,061
I haven't seen Sharkboy
or Lavagirl since then.

54
00:04:50,737 --> 00:04:53,729
And thas what I did this summer,

55
00:04:57,677 --> 00:04:59,372
Enough!

56
00:04:59,479 --> 00:05:04,246
Someone is picking that up,
And is not gonna be me!

57
00:05:05,218 --> 00:05:08,710
We were supposed to tell true stories,

58
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:10,756
That is a true story,

59
00:05:10,824 --> 00:05:15,818
- Does Lavagirl have special powers?
- There's no such thing as Lavagirl,

60
00:05:16,296 --> 00:05:18,526
She can...

61
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,031
She can shoot lava out of her hands,

62
00:05:24,104 --> 00:05:25,366
Cool,

63
00:05:25,438 --> 00:05:28,168
How many people think
Max's story is true?

64
00:05:28,775 --> 00:05:30,936
- Not true,
- Made up,

65
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:33,878
- Not true,
- Is just a made-up story,

66
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:39,175
If is true, why don't you bring
Sharkboy and Lavagirl to class tomorrow?

67
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:41,846
They went away,
I don't know where they went,

68
00:05:41,921 --> 00:05:43,411
Have a seat, Max,

69
00:05:43,490 --> 00:05:45,822
Linus, you're next,

70
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:57,427
This summer, I met a new friend...
who was half dork, half boy,

71
00:05:57,504 --> 00:05:59,665
I called him Dorkboy,

72
00:06:00,607 --> 00:06:02,370
But his real name was Max,

73
00:06:02,442 --> 00:06:08,278
We had him for dinner, but he stunk
so bad that we all blew chunks,

74
00:06:09,816 --> 00:06:12,512
Thas enough, Linus,

75
00:06:12,585 --> 00:06:16,043
Linus, Max, stay,

76
00:06:16,122 --> 00:06:17,817
Come on, Mr, E!

77
00:06:17,891 --> 00:06:20,086
Class, whas my name?

78
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,357
Mr, Electricidad,

79
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,024
Mr, Electricidad, exactly,

80
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:31,230
Not Mr, Electric,
not Mr, Electrici-tha-tha-tha-tha,

81
00:06:32,405 --> 00:06:36,739
Linus, you just earned a minus
for your behavior today,

82
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:41,042
This is a new year,
Do you think you can be friends?

83
00:06:41,114 --> 00:06:42,376
No,

84
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:45,543
Then is been decided:
You'll be the best of friends,

85
00:06:45,618 --> 00:06:49,486
Which means
no more picking on Max, Linus,

86
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:52,517
Max,

87
00:06:52,592 --> 00:06:56,358
You're in the fourth grade,
There are some good kids in this class,

88
00:06:56,429 --> 00:06:59,865
Find them, Make friends with them,

89
00:06:59,933 --> 00:07:04,870
Dreaming keeps you from seeing
whas right here in front of you,

90
00:07:04,938 --> 00:07:09,136
This isn't a dream,
This is the real world,

91
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:15,109
Lost my train of thought,

92
00:07:15,181 --> 00:07:17,342
No dreaming, Got it,

93
00:07:17,417 --> 00:07:19,282
I'll try harder,

94
00:07:19,352 --> 00:07:21,513
What do you have there?

95
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:26,255
Is my dream journal,

96
00:07:26,326 --> 00:07:29,489
It has all of my most precious dreams in it,

97
00:07:29,562 --> 00:07:33,191
I'll never part with it
for as long as I live,

98
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:36,767
You're a good kid, Max,

99
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:46,144
Max!

100
00:07:46,212 --> 00:07:49,238
Les be imaginary friends,

101
00:07:49,315 --> 00:07:53,775
You can try and hang with us...
and we'll pretend you don't exist!

102
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:58,481
Check it out,
Sharkboy gets shocked by electric eels,

103
00:07:58,558 --> 00:08:01,686
and then they feed on his cooked flesh,

104
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:03,626
Wow, Linus,

105
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:07,063
Your skills are... weak,

106
00:08:12,305 --> 00:08:14,330
Ohh...

107
00:08:16,776 --> 00:08:19,609
I'm gonna burst your bubble, Dream Boy,

108
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,316
You're dead!

109
00:08:25,385 --> 00:08:27,512
Get the book!

110
00:08:38,765 --> 00:08:40,699
Give me the book,

111
00:08:40,767 --> 00:08:44,760
Hand over the book,
or you'll visit the dream world!

112
00:09:01,988 --> 00:09:03,888
Ooh...

113
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,221
Agh-haa...

114
00:09:07,293 --> 00:09:09,454
All right! Got it!

115
00:09:12,232 --> 00:09:15,861
I'll bring you a revised edition tomorrow,

116
00:09:32,585 --> 00:09:35,850
- Max, wake up!
- Dream, Max.

117
00:09:35,922 --> 00:09:41,087
- Open your eyes, Max.
- Eyes open, and dream. Stay dreaming.

118
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,094
Wake up!

119
00:10:18,264 --> 00:10:20,323
Sharkboy!

120
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:23,892
And Lavagirl!

121
00:10:28,608 --> 00:10:30,132
Hyah!

122
00:10:30,977 --> 00:10:32,706
Max!

123
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:35,247
My cookies! My giant cookies!

124
00:10:35,315 --> 00:10:39,775
What are you doing baking sweets? You
know what happens when he eats sugar,

125
00:10:39,852 --> 00:10:41,911
I baked them for his class,

126
00:10:41,988 --> 00:10:45,389
So you could make friends at school,
and now you've eaten all of them,

127
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,323
No, it was Sharkboy and Lavagirl!

128
00:10:47,393 --> 00:10:51,955
Look - this one has shark bites,
and this one is singed,

129
00:10:52,031 --> 00:10:54,898
There's no such thing
as Sharkboy and Lavagirl,

130
00:10:54,968 --> 00:10:57,436
Well, I believe him,

131
00:10:57,503 --> 00:11:02,406
Your mother's right, When you go to sleep
and close your eyes, they may come back,

132
00:11:02,508 --> 00:11:07,309
But when you open 'em again, Sharkgirl
and Lavaboy'll be... outta here,

133
00:11:07,347 --> 00:11:10,544
- But...
- Shh, Mouth closed, eyes closed,

134
00:11:10,616 --> 00:11:13,107
- Now?
- Yes, now,

135
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:21,654
You can wait till you're in bed
to close your eyes, Max,

136
00:11:23,563 --> 00:11:25,963
Kids need their dreams,

137
00:11:26,733 --> 00:11:30,260
Kids... need to grow up!

138
00:11:36,209 --> 00:11:39,906
He's not making any friends
with these cookies!

139
00:11:42,648 --> 00:11:46,175
There's no such thing
as Sharkboy and Lavagirl,

140
00:11:46,352 --> 00:11:49,810
There's no such thing
as Sharkboy and Lavagirl,

141
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:52,515
Yes, there is,

142
00:11:53,626 --> 00:11:55,753
Stupid plugs!

143
00:11:56,496 --> 00:12:02,662
Please don't let me have to go to school,
They'll make fun of me, I know it!

144
00:12:02,735 --> 00:12:08,002
I wish I could just escape this loser world
and go to Planet Drool,

145
00:12:08,074 --> 00:12:11,407
Games and toys and laughs and fun...

146
00:12:14,981 --> 00:12:21,819
May there be terrible storms,
rain, sleet, snow, tornadoes...

147
00:12:23,056 --> 00:12:28,926
so I can lay here all day tomorrow
and dream of Drool,

148
00:12:55,054 --> 00:12:57,716
Guess I didn't dream hard enough,

149
00:12:58,257 --> 00:13:01,693
There are plenty of good opportunities,
You just need to look,

150
00:13:01,761 --> 00:13:04,229
Ooh, traffic engineer!

151
00:13:07,567 --> 00:13:08,795
Hey,

152
00:13:08,868 --> 00:13:11,666
I was cleaning out my closet
and look what I found,

153
00:13:11,737 --> 00:13:14,729
Remember Tobor?
The robot you tried to build?

154
00:13:14,807 --> 00:13:17,435
Why were you cleaning out your closet?

155
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,740
I had to find one of these,

156
00:13:19,812 --> 00:13:23,748
- Is Mom making you get a real job again?
- Writing is a real job,

157
00:13:25,852 --> 00:13:28,844
- When it pays,
- Max, I'm walking you to school today,

158
00:13:28,921 --> 00:13:32,789
So what do you say?
Wanna finish making Tobor?

159
00:13:33,459 --> 00:13:34,983
It won't work,

160
00:13:35,061 --> 00:13:39,327
- Well, how do you know?
- 'Cause you told me it wouldn't,

161
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:42,458
I did?

162
00:13:44,504 --> 00:13:48,964
I'm sorry,
I shoulïve never said that,

163
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,669
Is OK, You were right,

164
00:13:53,146 --> 00:13:55,239
Dumb idea,

165
00:13:57,917 --> 00:14:00,545
How did these happen?

166
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,088
The grass was dead anyway,

167
00:14:03,156 --> 00:14:05,454
Why are you so morbid?

168
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:10,121
I just wish anything could happen
so I wouldn't have to go to school today,

169
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:12,596
Thas not realistic, Max,

170
00:14:12,665 --> 00:14:16,795
Is bad enough your father's head
is in the clouds, but not you too, OK?

171
00:14:16,869 --> 00:14:20,532
Just push that dream aside and move on,

172
00:14:20,606 --> 00:14:25,839
Like with your dream?
The one about you and Dad and me?

173
00:14:25,912 --> 00:14:28,039
Well, I do have a dream about us,

174
00:14:28,114 --> 00:14:32,483
but, as I'm sure you've been noticing lately,
your father and I are just...

175
00:14:32,552 --> 00:14:36,318
Well, we're... not compatible,

176
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:41,725
Sorry, I don't mean to dump all this on you
right before you have to go to school, but...

177
00:14:41,794 --> 00:14:43,625
school's waiting,

178
00:14:43,696 --> 00:14:46,028
Did we have to move so close to school?

179
00:14:46,098 --> 00:14:48,999
Your father thought
we'd save money on gas,

180
00:14:49,068 --> 00:14:54,472
Come right home after school today, 'cause
there's some things we need to talk about,

181
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:56,440
I love you,

182
00:14:58,144 --> 00:15:02,342
I wish anything could happen
so I wouldn't have to come home today,

183
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:07,411
Hey, look, is Dream Boy!

184
00:15:12,925 --> 00:15:16,156
Who knows where tornadoes come from?

185
00:15:16,896 --> 00:15:21,799
Well, when cold air mixes with hot air,
it can form a tornado,

186
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:25,633
as the hot and cold chase each other
around and around and around,

187
00:15:25,705 --> 00:15:30,699
I dreamt of a story kind of like Sharkboy
and Lavagirl - Ice Girl and Dream Boy,

188
00:15:30,776 --> 00:15:34,439
Her powers come from her crystal heart,

189
00:15:35,248 --> 00:15:36,840
No more fairy tales,

190
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,316
Piranha Girl and Beluga Boy,

191
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:41,910
Plastic Boy and Metal Girl,

192
00:15:41,988 --> 00:15:43,922
Barf Boy and Vomit Girl,

193
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:47,153
Does everyone hear me?
I'm a teacher, right?

194
00:15:47,226 --> 00:15:49,717
Wrong, I'm an awakener,

195
00:15:49,795 --> 00:15:54,494
Only I'm finding it more and more difficult
to keep my class... awake,

196
00:15:55,301 --> 00:15:58,134
No recess again for you, Marissa -
too many allergies,

197
00:15:58,204 --> 00:16:01,037
There are more boogers on your work
than there is work,

198
00:16:01,107 --> 00:16:03,769
I'm just cold,

199
00:16:03,843 --> 00:16:08,405
I'll be happy to change places with you,
Is a lot warmer back there in my spot,

200
00:16:08,481 --> 00:16:10,881
But I... have to sit up front,

201
00:16:10,950 --> 00:16:14,351
Is just that you're sitting
right under the vent,

202
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:18,254
- Is August and you're sneezing,
- You're gonna get me in trouble,

203
00:16:18,324 --> 00:16:20,315
Max,

204
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,620
Are you... trying to make real friends?

205
00:16:24,697 --> 00:16:26,927
Trying, like you told me to,

206
00:16:26,999 --> 00:16:30,765
Thas good,
Just not with my daughter, OK?

207
00:16:33,039 --> 00:16:35,940
No! It wasn't like that, Is just...

208
00:16:36,008 --> 00:16:38,238
Sit down, Max,

209
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,521
- Give me back my journal!
- Class has begun, Everyone in your seats,

210
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,787
- Linus took my journal!
- I did not!

211
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,658
Minus! I mean, Linus,

212
00:16:57,730 --> 00:17:02,360
You get a minus for misconduct,
Give Max back his journal,

213
00:17:03,536 --> 00:17:07,131
One more time, Linus, and we'll have to
change your name to Minus,

214
00:17:15,114 --> 00:17:17,480
He ruined my dream journal!

215
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:20,815
I did not! Mr, Electric,
send him to the principal's office

216
00:17:20,886 --> 00:17:23,354
and have him expelled!

217
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:26,687
You're in my class,
not the other way around!

218
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:30,661
I know everything
and you know nothing!

219
00:17:30,730 --> 00:17:35,531
At the end of class,
both of you report to the principal's office!

220
00:17:35,601 --> 00:17:37,228
With your parents!

221
00:18:00,326 --> 00:18:02,226
Everybody down!

222
00:18:15,941 --> 00:18:17,909
Is them!

223
00:18:27,987 --> 00:18:30,353
I'm looking for Max,

224
00:18:40,032 --> 00:18:41,932
She's hot!

225
00:18:45,471 --> 00:18:47,029
Whoa!

226
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:50,737
We need your help, Max,
Come with us,

227
00:18:52,845 --> 00:18:54,710
What do I have to do?

228
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,544
Go with us to Planet Drool,
We'll explain on the way,

229
00:18:57,616 --> 00:18:59,379
We're going to Planet Drool?

230
00:19:04,657 --> 00:19:07,785
Is my home planet,
Just outside our solar system,

231
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:11,193
You should know, Max - you made it up,

232
00:19:14,767 --> 00:19:16,962
- I can't go with you,
- Why not?

233
00:19:17,036 --> 00:19:21,496
Because you're not real,
Both of you are just a dream,

234
00:19:22,775 --> 00:19:26,768
And when I open my eyes, you'll be gone,

235
00:19:32,451 --> 00:19:34,646
We're still here, Max,

236
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:40,590
If you wanna stop the darkness
from destroying our worlds, come with us,

237
00:19:41,327 --> 00:19:43,420
You better go with them,

238
00:19:45,731 --> 00:19:48,359
OK... I'll go,

239
00:19:52,438 --> 00:19:55,635
Everyone follow me
and we'll find shelter,

240
00:19:55,708 --> 00:20:00,702
I can't believe I'm finally getting
to ditch this place and go to Planet Drool!

241
00:20:00,779 --> 00:20:02,679
How are we getting there?

242
00:20:14,393 --> 00:20:16,588
Put these on, everybody,

243
00:20:16,662 --> 00:20:20,621
Blue goggles for the boys,
pink for the girls,

244
00:20:20,699 --> 00:20:23,395
Do you have another pair of boy goggles?

245
00:20:24,003 --> 00:20:25,561
Uh-uh,

246
00:20:28,607 --> 00:20:31,201
So, how do you fly it?

247
00:20:31,277 --> 00:20:33,768
- You don't know?
- Duh!

248
00:20:33,846 --> 00:20:36,246
Thas sort of been the whole problem!

249
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:39,675
You press go,

250
00:20:57,970 --> 00:21:02,498
- Now, how do you fly it?
- Is got an autopilot,

251
00:21:02,575 --> 00:21:05,271
You just thought of everything,
didn't you, Max?

252
00:21:05,344 --> 00:21:07,471
Not exactly,

253
00:21:07,546 --> 00:21:12,950
- How do we land it?
- Thas the part I never thought of!

254
00:21:13,385 --> 00:21:16,582
Jupiter... Saturn... Neptune...

255
00:21:17,056 --> 00:21:19,991
You might wanna hold on to something,

256
00:21:41,113 --> 00:21:43,581
Recognize your dream world, Max?

257
00:21:43,649 --> 00:21:45,981
Not really,

258
00:21:46,051 --> 00:21:49,578
I feel like I should,
but I just don't,

259
00:21:49,655 --> 00:21:52,146
Is affecting him too,

260
00:21:52,224 --> 00:21:54,522
I thought he would just remember,

261
00:21:54,593 --> 00:21:58,962
- Remember what?
- Your dreams, This planet?

262
00:21:59,598 --> 00:22:01,498
Us,

263
00:22:01,567 --> 00:22:04,127
Your powers,

264
00:22:04,203 --> 00:22:07,798
- I have powers?
- More than any of us,

265
00:22:07,873 --> 00:22:10,239
Don't you know that?

266
00:22:10,309 --> 00:22:14,871
Everything that is or was,
began with a dream,

267
00:22:14,947 --> 00:22:19,509
And you dreamt us, Max,
Us and this whole place,

268
00:22:19,585 --> 00:22:20,574
I did?

269
00:22:20,653 --> 00:22:24,316
Every dream you ever had
landed right here on Planet Drool,

270
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:27,052
Why is it so dark?

271
00:22:27,126 --> 00:22:30,857
The planet is dying,
It began yesterday,

272
00:22:30,929 --> 00:22:33,591
Whas the calculation, Sharkboy?

273
00:22:34,800 --> 00:22:38,736
45 minutes till the darkness
destroys Planet Drool,

274
00:22:38,804 --> 00:22:44,299
We didn't go to Earth to save you, Max,
We need you to save Planet Drool,

275
00:22:46,078 --> 00:22:47,739
But how?

276
00:22:47,813 --> 00:22:50,782
The Dream Lair
is on the other side of the planet,

277
00:22:50,849 --> 00:22:54,615
Thas where your dreams are going bad,
We have to go there and reverse it,

278
00:22:54,687 --> 00:22:58,316
We have to travel through the Passage
of Time, catch the Train of Thought,

279
00:22:58,390 --> 00:23:00,551
swim down the Stream of Consciousness

280
00:23:00,626 --> 00:23:04,562
and skate across the Sea of Confusion -
now covered in ice,

281
00:23:04,630 --> 00:23:08,191
Why'd you do that, Max?
Why'd you freeze the ocean?

282
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:09,529
I...

283
00:23:10,002 --> 00:23:11,026
Ouch!

284
00:23:11,103 --> 00:23:13,799
Max didn't mean to do it,
Did you, Max?

285
00:23:13,872 --> 00:23:18,969
Max is a good boy, otherwise
you and I would be evil, and we're not evil,

286
00:23:19,044 --> 00:23:21,478
I'm not evil, am I, Max?

287
00:23:21,547 --> 00:23:23,447
I don't think so,

288
00:23:23,515 --> 00:23:26,814
Thas why we brought you here -
to put things back in order,

289
00:23:26,885 --> 00:23:30,446
We just have to stay positive,
Is not the end of the world,

290
00:23:30,522 --> 00:23:32,547
Not yet, is not,

291
00:23:35,127 --> 00:23:37,721
The darkness! Run!

292
00:23:38,664 --> 00:23:40,529
This is like a bad dream!

293
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:45,662
Oh, yeah? Just wait till you meet Mr,
Electric! He's the worst bad dream yet!

294
00:23:57,116 --> 00:23:59,346
Where is everyone?

295
00:23:59,451 --> 00:24:03,012
- Mostly trapped on Mount Neverrest,
- By Mr, Electric,

296
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:06,923
But Planet Drool's a place for kids
to dream and have endless fun!

297
00:24:08,127 --> 00:24:11,392
Is endless fun, all right,
Once you get on...

298
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:17,262
... you can't get off,

299
00:24:17,336 --> 00:24:20,999
Kids aren't allowed to rest,
'cause if they rest, they sleep,

300
00:24:21,073 --> 00:24:23,200
and if they sleep, they dream,

301
00:24:23,275 --> 00:24:26,540
- And if they dream...
- It takes power away from Mr, Electric,

302
00:24:26,612 --> 00:24:29,274
But we're gonna stop him
with our secret weapon,

303
00:24:29,348 --> 00:24:32,442
Shouldn't we save those kids first?

304
00:24:48,667 --> 00:24:50,931
Why can't I do that?

305
00:25:04,516 --> 00:25:07,349
Lavagirl! Hooray!

306
00:25:25,137 --> 00:25:28,334
Who knows where Mr, Electric is hiding?

307
00:25:30,142 --> 00:25:31,973
Everyone?

308
00:25:32,044 --> 00:25:36,845
They're not raising their hands,
You're all upside down,

309
00:25:39,084 --> 00:25:40,847
Ah,

310
00:25:40,919 --> 00:25:44,787
Who is stopping
my unstoppable coasters?

311
00:25:46,491 --> 00:25:49,221
- Back in your seats!
- Go! Run! Hide!

312
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:51,956
- Les get outta here!
- Everyone back in your seats!

313
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,964
Who's Mr, Electric?

314
00:25:54,032 --> 00:26:00,164
He's supposed to provide light to the
planet, but all he brings now is darkness,

315
00:26:00,239 --> 00:26:02,332
Fun has begun!

316
00:26:19,324 --> 00:26:21,315
He's taking us up!

317
00:26:27,566 --> 00:26:31,366
My home! At half its normal power,

318
00:26:38,977 --> 00:26:41,445
He's taking us down,

319
00:26:47,719 --> 00:26:49,619
Show time!

320
00:27:04,403 --> 00:27:06,769
Keep playing! Never stop!

321
00:27:06,838 --> 00:27:11,400
Games and toys and laughs...
hey-hey-hey... and fun!

322
00:27:15,714 --> 00:27:20,083
Well, well, well,
If it isn't Sharkboy and Lavagirl,

323
00:27:20,152 --> 00:27:26,682
What are you doing halting my endless-fun
coaster and infiltrating my lair?

324
00:27:26,758 --> 00:27:28,885
We don't need permission from you,

325
00:27:28,961 --> 00:27:30,519
Fiery!

326
00:27:30,595 --> 00:27:35,055
I don't believe we've met,
I'm Mr, Electric!

327
00:27:35,133 --> 00:27:38,762
Why are you bringing misery to our planet?
You're supposed to be running it,

328
00:27:38,837 --> 00:27:44,605
You're supposed to be running it,
I am running it - right into the ground,

329
00:27:44,676 --> 00:27:47,270
- Those are my orders,
- Who ordered that?

330
00:27:47,346 --> 00:27:52,443
No school, no discipline, no rules,
And, most important, no dreams,

331
00:27:52,517 --> 00:27:54,576
Dreams can destroy you, can't they?

332
00:27:54,653 --> 00:27:57,816
- My instincts tell me that is so,
- Really?

333
00:27:57,889 --> 00:28:03,327
- Thas why we have to stop you,
- You and what army?

334
00:28:09,267 --> 00:28:11,360
- Now?
- Now,

335
00:28:28,387 --> 00:28:32,050
Ha-ha-ha-haa! Pee-pee-pee-pee...

336
00:28:56,348 --> 00:28:58,179
Feel the burn!

337
00:28:58,283 --> 00:28:59,841
Agh...

338
00:29:04,322 --> 00:29:07,155
Not for real, Aaah!

339
00:29:16,868 --> 00:29:18,631
Ha-ha!

340
00:29:42,594 --> 00:29:46,257
Internal radar, shark-like reflexes...
You're amazing!

341
00:29:46,331 --> 00:29:49,357
But is it enough to defeat Mr, Electric?

342
00:29:49,434 --> 00:29:52,699
We have our secret weapon, remember?

343
00:29:53,972 --> 00:29:57,874
Did you really believe you could stop me?

344
00:29:57,943 --> 00:29:59,740
Oh... Ah...

345
00:29:59,811 --> 00:30:02,974
I know we can't, But he can,

346
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:05,073
Take it away, Max,

347
00:30:09,154 --> 00:30:12,885
- Show him what you're made of, Max,
- What am I supposed to do?

348
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:17,851
- I told you this would happen,
- I thought he would just remember,

349
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:19,260
Remember what?!

350
00:30:20,866 --> 00:30:23,232
The dream, Remember the dream,

351
00:30:23,301 --> 00:30:25,826
I don't remember half my dreams,

352
00:30:27,706 --> 00:30:30,334
Thas why I write them
in my dream journal,

353
00:30:34,179 --> 00:30:37,307
What half of your dreams
do you remember?

354
00:30:37,382 --> 00:30:39,350
This one I remember,

355
00:30:39,417 --> 00:30:41,385
Where are you taking us?

356
00:30:41,453 --> 00:30:45,947
Where all useless dreams go -
to the Dream Graveyard!

357
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:49,390
Whoa!

358
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:52,421
Ploop!

359
00:30:58,570 --> 00:31:00,231
Cuckoo!

360
00:31:03,408 --> 00:31:07,105
Well, at least we're on
the Passage of Time,

361
00:31:07,179 --> 00:31:09,147
Maybe ill take us to the Dream Lair,

362
00:31:09,214 --> 00:31:13,810
Is going in the wrong
direction, The Dream Lair's that way,

363
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:16,988
Whas in the Dream Lair?

364
00:31:17,055 --> 00:31:20,115
Is where all the dreams
that fuel Planet Drool are stored,

365
00:31:20,192 --> 00:31:22,183
But they're being destroyed,

366
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,854
- How?
- Thas what we have to find out,

367
00:31:24,930 --> 00:31:28,525
Soon even Sharkboy and I
will cease to exist,

368
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,090
Duck!

369
00:31:33,905 --> 00:31:37,500
Max, where is your dream journal?

370
00:31:37,576 --> 00:31:39,373
Great thinking, Sharkie!

371
00:31:39,444 --> 00:31:43,778
We can read his dreams out loud
and turn everything back to the way it was,

372
00:31:43,848 --> 00:31:46,749
I may even realize my true identity,

373
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:49,410
I threw it away,

374
00:31:50,855 --> 00:31:53,289
My journal's back on Earth,

375
00:31:57,762 --> 00:32:00,356
We really thought
you were the answer, Max,

376
00:32:00,432 --> 00:32:03,799
Don't listen to him, He's just upset
because you didn't show up

377
00:32:03,868 --> 00:32:08,066
and make him king of the ocean,
with a giant fish army to back him up,

378
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:09,697
Look who's talking!

379
00:32:09,774 --> 00:32:13,266
You thought you'd find a great use
for your powers and heal the planet,

380
00:32:13,345 --> 00:32:18,339
Max thought his dream world would be
a happy place, We've all been duped,

381
00:32:19,851 --> 00:32:21,341
Ohh!

382
00:32:28,693 --> 00:32:31,161
I think you broke my fin,

383
00:32:32,597 --> 00:32:34,360
Sorry,

384
00:32:38,570 --> 00:32:43,200
Hey, you! I see you hiding!
Come back here!

385
00:32:44,542 --> 00:32:47,033
I was awakened!

386
00:32:47,712 --> 00:32:48,906
I'm sorry,

387
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:52,541
Did all the children
from Mount Neverrest escape?

388
00:32:52,617 --> 00:32:55,984
It was Sharkboy and Lavagirl,
But I took care of it - see?

389
00:32:56,054 --> 00:32:57,919
Someone was with them?

390
00:32:58,023 --> 00:33:01,481
Just another child afraid of
his own shadow, No threat to us,

391
00:33:01,526 --> 00:33:04,188
I banished him to the Dream Graveyard,

392
00:33:04,262 --> 00:33:07,823
Where old dreams lie?
He could find an ally!

393
00:33:07,899 --> 00:33:13,462
I told you, every dream must be smashed,
every child captured!

394
00:33:13,538 --> 00:33:16,996
You want him back,
we'll simply track him when he falls asleep,

395
00:33:17,075 --> 00:33:20,567
Fool! He's the Daydreamer,

396
00:33:20,645 --> 00:33:25,105
And the moment he realizes it
will be the moment of our doom!

397
00:33:25,183 --> 00:33:26,810
Now what do you want me to do?

398
00:33:26,885 --> 00:33:29,979
Bring me the boy
before he discovers his true powers

399
00:33:30,055 --> 00:33:32,785
and tears my new kingdom apart!

400
00:33:33,525 --> 00:33:36,722
Plugs, redirect the darkness,

401
00:33:36,795 --> 00:33:38,660
And...

402
00:33:41,666 --> 00:33:45,033
bring me the Plughounds!

403
00:33:52,344 --> 00:33:55,507
We'll never find our way
out of this graveyard,

404
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,481
Darkness! Headed this way!

405
00:33:59,584 --> 00:34:01,211
Sit down, Max,

406
00:34:01,286 --> 00:34:03,754
- What for?
- Close your eyes and dream,

407
00:34:03,822 --> 00:34:07,553
If Max can't remember his dreams,
maybe he can redream them,

408
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:09,718
He could dream us out of here,

409
00:34:09,794 --> 00:34:11,955
Dream, Max,

410
00:34:14,265 --> 00:34:16,699
Now, what do you see?

411
00:34:16,768 --> 00:34:22,764
I see a... giant...
chocolate-chunk marshmallow cookie...

412
00:34:23,508 --> 00:34:26,341
with lots of warm milk,

413
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:31,206
- Sorry, I'm starving,
- Here's some food,

414
00:34:31,282 --> 00:34:35,810
- You're not gonna like that,
- I'm so hungry I could eat lava rocks,

415
00:34:41,659 --> 00:34:43,456
What is that?!

416
00:34:43,528 --> 00:34:44,995
Lava rocks,

417
00:34:45,063 --> 00:34:47,793
Here, have some real food,
Fresh sushi,

418
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:50,528
- Ill knock you right out,
- Thas not fresh,

419
00:34:50,602 --> 00:34:52,968
I'm not even sure thas sushi anymore,

420
00:34:53,037 --> 00:34:56,905
- Is just a few weeks old,
- I'll cook it for you,

421
00:35:00,145 --> 00:35:01,134
Oops,

422
00:35:01,212 --> 00:35:03,476
Is OK, I'm not that hungry anymore,

423
00:35:03,548 --> 00:35:07,109
Let me just rest a moment,
Maybe I can sleep,

424
00:35:09,053 --> 00:35:11,715
Is getting closer,

425
00:35:14,959 --> 00:35:17,189
Get outta here!

426
00:35:20,098 --> 00:35:22,828
Max, I know you've got a lot to figure out,

427
00:35:22,901 --> 00:35:27,736
but if you happen to dream about who I am
and how I fit into this world,

428
00:35:27,806 --> 00:35:29,706
it would really be helpful for me...

429
00:35:29,774 --> 00:35:33,801
No distractions, You steer him off course,
we could be lost in a sea of dreams,

430
00:35:33,878 --> 00:35:37,279
- I'm sorry, I'm desperate,
- Focus on the problem at hand,

431
00:35:37,348 --> 00:35:40,943
Max needs to dream us out of here,
so how about I put him to sleep?

432
00:35:41,019 --> 00:35:44,716
- No, Sharkboy,
- Just one punch, He'll be out like a light,

433
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:52,988
I've seen this before,
Is on the tip of my... finger,

434
00:35:53,598 --> 00:35:55,896
Is a hand!

435
00:35:57,035 --> 00:35:58,662
It is a hand,

436
00:36:00,538 --> 00:36:02,529
A hand?

437
00:36:03,374 --> 00:36:05,239
Another hand,

438
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:06,538
Yep?

439
00:36:06,611 --> 00:36:08,670
- Is Tobor!
- Who?

440
00:36:08,746 --> 00:36:11,943
Tobor! I dreamt him up when I was a kid -

441
00:36:12,016 --> 00:36:15,042
a robot that could help me
with my homework,

442
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:20,079
I tried to build him once, Everyone
kept telling me he would never work,

443
00:36:20,158 --> 00:36:24,219
So here he is - a forgotten dream
in the Dream Graveyard,

444
00:36:24,295 --> 00:36:26,991
Maybe he can help us,

445
00:36:27,065 --> 00:36:29,533
He's supposed to be very smart,

446
00:36:29,601 --> 00:36:31,796
Tobor, awake!

447
00:36:32,604 --> 00:36:34,299
Yes?

448
00:36:34,372 --> 00:36:35,999
He works!

449
00:36:36,074 --> 00:36:39,237
- We can ask him anything now,
- Let me, let me!

450
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:42,643
Tell me something about me,
I'm clueless,

451
00:36:42,714 --> 00:36:47,276
Actually, you are extremely bright,

452
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:50,417
Am I king of the ocean, or what?

453
00:36:50,488 --> 00:36:52,683
No, Sorry,

454
00:36:53,758 --> 00:36:56,192
How do I save Planet Drool?

455
00:36:56,828 --> 00:37:00,491
The answer is in your dreams,

456
00:37:00,598 --> 00:37:04,125
You mean if I put him to sleep,
he'll dream us out of this mess?

457
00:37:04,168 --> 00:37:07,934
No, At least, not here,

458
00:37:08,006 --> 00:37:13,444
Darkness is falling, Any dream of his
would become a nightmare -

459
00:37:13,511 --> 00:37:16,776
and you don't want those
becoming a reality,

460
00:37:16,848 --> 00:37:20,306
But if you go
to the Land of Milk and Cookies...

461
00:37:20,385 --> 00:37:21,545
Of course!

462
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:24,179
... thas where the good dreams are,

463
00:37:24,255 --> 00:37:26,815
Where the answers are,

464
00:37:26,891 --> 00:37:28,415
Is perfect, Max,

465
00:37:28,493 --> 00:37:31,860
The Land of Milk and Cookies
is a safe, sweet place,

466
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:34,228
You'll be able to dream easily there,

467
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:35,891
Can you take us?

468
00:37:35,967 --> 00:37:39,562
I have no body, I can't move,

469
00:37:39,637 --> 00:37:43,198
You can move your eyes and your mouth,

470
00:37:43,908 --> 00:37:46,672
Why didn't you work back on Earth, Tobor?

471
00:37:46,744 --> 00:37:52,182
Some dreams are so powerful they
become real - like Sharkboy and Lavagirl,

472
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:57,187
I, on the other hand,
am still only a dream,

473
00:37:57,255 --> 00:37:58,244
Oh...

474
00:37:58,356 --> 00:38:02,349
- Whas wrong?
- Train of Thought... I'm losing it,

475
00:38:02,393 --> 00:38:05,419
You were taking us to the Land
of Milk and Cookies, remember?

476
00:38:05,496 --> 00:38:10,229
I mean I'm literally losing
the Train of Thought, Is down there,

477
00:38:10,301 --> 00:38:14,032
Thas the Train of Thought?
How do I keep it on track?

478
00:38:14,105 --> 00:38:18,701
With your mind, The Train of Thought
gets easily distracted,

479
00:38:18,776 --> 00:38:23,975
Stay focused, and ill speed you directly
to the Land of Milk and Cookies,

480
00:38:24,048 --> 00:38:26,016
The rest is up to you,

481
00:38:26,084 --> 00:38:28,279
Sorry I forgot about you, Tobor,

482
00:38:28,353 --> 00:38:31,379
Are you kidding? You just saved me,

483
00:38:31,456 --> 00:38:34,016
I'm free!

484
00:38:39,197 --> 00:38:41,597
Max, get down here!

485
00:38:44,435 --> 00:38:47,598
- Whas wrong?
- We can't control it,

486
00:38:47,672 --> 00:38:49,970
All you have to do is keep it on track,

487
00:38:50,041 --> 00:38:53,875
How can you keep it on track
if there is no track?

488
00:38:57,115 --> 00:38:59,583
Looks like another dream gone bad!

489
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:02,746
What do we do?

490
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:05,516
Yell? Scream?

491
00:39:14,098 --> 00:39:16,259
Jump, lll be all right,

492
00:39:32,784 --> 00:39:36,811
What does it mean
when your Train of Thought... wrecks?

493
00:39:36,888 --> 00:39:40,984
Well... It can't be good, buddy,

494
00:39:41,059 --> 00:39:44,028
How much time do we have, Sharkboy?

495
00:39:45,196 --> 00:39:47,562
2O minutes,

496
00:39:53,404 --> 00:39:54,393
Eww!

497
00:39:54,472 --> 00:39:57,737
Stick to rotten fish, please!

498
00:39:57,809 --> 00:40:01,677
Chocolate! I stepped in chocolate!

499
00:40:04,982 --> 00:40:07,143
We're here,

500
00:40:12,123 --> 00:40:14,751
The Land of Milk and Cookies!

501
00:40:17,061 --> 00:40:19,154
Oh, yeah!

502
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:25,567
The milk is warm,
He'll be out in no time,

503
00:40:25,636 --> 00:40:29,470
Lay down,
Here's a marshmallow pillow,

504
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:32,100
How about dreaming us
into the Dream Lair?

505
00:40:34,645 --> 00:40:37,239
The ground is thumping too much,

506
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:40,317
My highly trained ears hear it too,

507
00:40:40,384 --> 00:40:42,614
Boom, boom, boom,

508
00:40:42,687 --> 00:40:44,985
- Let me hear it,
- I wouldn't,

509
00:40:48,426 --> 00:40:49,791
Hothead,

510
00:40:49,861 --> 00:40:55,925
When you dreamt up these giant cookies,
who did you expect to be able to eat them?

511
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,831
I really didn't think about it,

512
00:40:57,935 --> 00:41:00,165
'Cause if you dream giant cookies,

513
00:41:00,204 --> 00:41:04,573
something has to be created
to consume giant cookies,

514
00:41:12,183 --> 00:41:14,083
Cookie giants!

515
00:41:37,208 --> 00:41:38,732
Ohh...

516
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:48,009
Frosting,

517
00:41:51,489 --> 00:41:54,356
Those giants almost look like my parents,

518
00:41:54,425 --> 00:41:57,223
They seem happy together,
Is that your dream?

519
00:41:57,295 --> 00:42:01,425
We had a dream we're family,
It hasn't been coming true lately,

520
00:42:01,532 --> 00:42:06,299
Most dreams don't come true on their own,
You have to make them true,

521
00:42:06,337 --> 00:42:09,363
It takes a lot of work, Not easy,

522
00:42:10,274 --> 00:42:12,742
But not impossible either,

523
00:42:14,178 --> 00:42:16,442
Stinking fresh air!

524
00:42:16,948 --> 00:42:19,610
Blinding sunlight!

525
00:42:19,684 --> 00:42:25,145
Oh, how I long for a sky
of fluorescent lights!

526
00:42:37,134 --> 00:42:38,465
Ahh...

527
00:42:39,770 --> 00:42:42,170
Better stand back,

528
00:42:44,575 --> 00:42:46,668
All right, that was me,

529
00:42:47,879 --> 00:42:51,975
- Still empty-handed, I see,
- If you're so powerful, you find him,

530
00:42:52,049 --> 00:42:56,145
Thas your job!
Do it, or I'll have you discharged!

531
00:42:56,220 --> 00:42:57,847
Shh...

532
00:42:58,689 --> 00:43:01,021
Someone is dreaming in here,

533
00:43:03,527 --> 00:43:08,021
All right, Max, you've had
your cookies and milk, Now go to sleep,

534
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:10,465
I'll try,

535
00:43:10,534 --> 00:43:12,365
Go to sleep!

536
00:43:12,436 --> 00:43:15,530
Not like that, Sing him a lullaby,

537
00:43:16,507 --> 00:43:21,843
Dream, dream, dream, dream...

538
00:43:22,513 --> 00:43:24,174
Your turn,

539
00:43:24,815 --> 00:43:28,842
Close your eyes, shut your mouth,
dream a dream and get us out

540
00:43:28,920 --> 00:43:32,253
Dream, dream, dream,
dream, dream, dream

541
00:43:32,323 --> 00:43:36,316
Hit the hay, fast asleep,
dream a dream, you little bleep

542
00:43:36,394 --> 00:43:39,761
Dream, dream, dream,
dream, dream, dream

543
00:43:44,769 --> 00:43:47,533
Is working! Keep it up, Sharkboy,

544
00:43:49,307 --> 00:43:53,539
Just relax, lay about,
or my fist will put you out

545
00:43:53,611 --> 00:43:56,705
Dream, dream, dream,
dream, dream, dream

546
00:43:56,781 --> 00:44:00,979
Take your time, but beware,
there's darkness in the air

547
00:44:01,085 --> 00:44:04,248
Dream, dream, dream,
dream, dream, dream

548
00:44:04,288 --> 00:44:06,279
Dream about me next, Max,

549
00:44:06,357 --> 00:44:08,951
I need to know who I am,

550
00:44:09,026 --> 00:44:12,757
Not just destruction or a simple flame,

551
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:15,492
Dream of me as something good,

552
00:44:19,937 --> 00:44:23,930
Don't despair, step right up
Glass of water? Here's a cup

553
00:44:24,008 --> 00:44:26,943
Dream, dream, dream,
dream, dream, dream

554
00:44:27,011 --> 00:44:29,878
He's having a nightmare!
Wake up, Max! Wake up!

555
00:44:29,947 --> 00:44:33,781
Stop that racket, Sharkboy -
you're giving him nightmares!

556
00:44:34,652 --> 00:44:36,779
Sorry, Max,

557
00:44:36,854 --> 00:44:37,946
Argh!

558
00:44:38,022 --> 00:44:40,286
Ow! Ohh...

559
00:44:40,358 --> 00:44:42,223
What was that for?

560
00:44:42,293 --> 00:44:45,660
Your nightmare was about me, wasn't it?

561
00:44:45,730 --> 00:44:47,994
I don't remember,

562
00:44:48,065 --> 00:44:50,295
But I did dream about one thing...

563
00:44:51,469 --> 00:44:53,494
Plughounds!

564
00:44:55,906 --> 00:44:58,807
This may come as a shock to you,

565
00:45:01,545 --> 00:45:04,036
Feel the power!

566
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:09,946
Is empty!

567
00:45:12,056 --> 00:45:13,387
Fudge,

568
00:45:14,158 --> 00:45:16,626
I forgot to dream of gas,

569
00:45:16,694 --> 00:45:19,288
Max!

570
00:45:33,511 --> 00:45:35,809
My powers are weakening,

571
00:45:39,683 --> 00:45:43,414
Watch the power lines - very dangerous,

572
00:45:53,764 --> 00:45:55,891
Yaaarrhh!

573
00:46:12,583 --> 00:46:14,574
Yaaarrhh!

574
00:46:15,586 --> 00:46:17,713
Sharkboy, get me down from here!

575
00:46:17,788 --> 00:46:20,348
Can't you see I'm busy?

576
00:46:39,510 --> 00:46:42,502
Hot lava... Hot lava...

577
00:46:47,785 --> 00:46:50,253
I don't got much fight left in me, Max,

578
00:46:50,321 --> 00:46:52,255
Where's Lavagirl?

579
00:46:53,357 --> 00:46:55,291
Is up to you now, Max,

580
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:57,919
Dream us out of here,

581
00:46:58,028 --> 00:47:00,496
We believe in you, Max,

582
00:47:02,366 --> 00:47:06,666
Shark boat with turbo boosters!
Shark boat with turbo boosters!

583
00:47:09,940 --> 00:47:11,999
A banana split?!

584
00:47:12,076 --> 00:47:15,705
Still hungry, Max?
How about a knuckle sandwich?

585
00:47:15,779 --> 00:47:17,872
No, look!

586
00:47:17,948 --> 00:47:20,280
Is a banana-split boat!

587
00:47:21,285 --> 00:47:23,480
Then les split!

588
00:47:24,488 --> 00:47:25,887
Ow!

589
00:47:25,956 --> 00:47:27,253
Huh?

590
00:47:48,946 --> 00:47:51,107
Catch you later,

591
00:47:51,949 --> 00:47:56,443
All dreamers must dream,

592
00:47:57,254 --> 00:48:00,883
This is great, Max,
You're starting to daydream,

593
00:48:00,991 --> 00:48:04,256
Keep that up, and they'll never get us,

594
00:48:04,295 --> 00:48:06,456
Why not?

595
00:48:06,530 --> 00:48:11,433
Learn to dream with your eyes open,
and you won't have to be asleep to dream,

596
00:48:11,502 --> 00:48:15,700
You'll be able to make anything happen
at any time,

597
00:48:18,275 --> 00:48:24,077
Row, row, row your banana-split boat
gently down the Stream of Consciousness

598
00:48:24,148 --> 00:48:26,548
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily

599
00:48:26,617 --> 00:48:29,245
Life is Max's dream

600
00:48:31,055 --> 00:48:33,182
Sugar will give you nightmares,

601
00:48:33,257 --> 00:48:36,522
- How much time do we have?
- Don't ask,

602
00:48:37,294 --> 00:48:42,755
The Dream Lair's across the Ocean of Ice,
We'll have to travel there by foot,

603
00:48:42,833 --> 00:48:45,768
What was it you saw in your dream, Max?

604
00:48:46,570 --> 00:48:50,301
I saw an object shaped like...

605
00:48:51,242 --> 00:48:53,710
Give me something to draw with,

606
00:49:05,322 --> 00:49:07,347
The Crystal Heart!

607
00:49:07,424 --> 00:49:12,054
Thas the treasure of the Land of Ice!
In the Ice Castle,

608
00:49:12,129 --> 00:49:15,929
It can freeze anything - even time,

609
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,401
I've always dreamt
of freezing a moment in time,

610
00:49:19,470 --> 00:49:22,098
And the Ice Castle's
ruled by the Ice Princess,

611
00:49:22,172 --> 00:49:25,039
I hear she's the most beautiful girl
on the planet,

612
00:49:25,409 --> 00:49:26,433
Ouch!

613
00:49:26,510 --> 00:49:30,344
She is not! She's cold and cruel
and cares for nobody but herself,

614
00:49:30,414 --> 00:49:32,848
She's just saying that, Max,

615
00:49:32,916 --> 00:49:36,079
- Have you met her?
- No, But I know we don't get along,

616
00:49:36,153 --> 00:49:40,385
- How do you know that?
- I'm fire, She's ice,

617
00:49:40,457 --> 00:49:42,516
We must be enemies,

618
00:49:42,593 --> 00:49:44,891
We need that Crystal Heart,

619
00:49:44,962 --> 00:49:47,556
But I need you both to get it,

620
00:49:48,098 --> 00:49:50,532
I just hope this isn't a trap,

621
00:49:50,601 --> 00:49:52,000
Whoa!

622
00:49:55,739 --> 00:49:58,173
If we freeze time with the Crystal Heart,

623
00:49:58,242 --> 00:50:01,973
we'll be able to make it to the Dream Lair
and save the planet,

624
00:50:02,046 --> 00:50:04,037
Thas the plan,

625
00:50:06,283 --> 00:50:08,410
Behold the Ice Castle!

626
00:50:08,485 --> 00:50:11,283
Home to the Princess of the Land of Ice,

627
00:50:11,355 --> 00:50:15,655
- The Crystal Hears inside the castle?
- So they say,

628
00:50:15,726 --> 00:50:17,853
Les go,

629
00:50:37,014 --> 00:50:39,847
Is no use! I'll melt the bridge,

630
00:50:39,917 --> 00:50:42,283
This place inflames me,

631
00:50:42,353 --> 00:50:44,787
Can you cool down enough to get across?

632
00:50:44,855 --> 00:50:46,948
I'd have to be asleep to do that,

633
00:50:47,725 --> 00:50:50,125
Can you try sleepwalking?

634
00:50:55,265 --> 00:51:00,464
My dream is to live on Earth -
but someplace warm -

635
00:51:00,571 --> 00:51:02,698
and that Earth will accept me,

636
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:06,506
even... if I... destroy...

637
00:51:07,211 --> 00:51:09,543
everything I... touch!

638
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:13,015
No, Lavagirl! Don't sneeze!

639
00:51:21,625 --> 00:51:23,115
Aaa-tchoo!

640
00:51:23,193 --> 00:51:25,184
Aarghh...

641
00:51:30,067 --> 00:51:31,227
Look,

642
00:51:33,337 --> 00:51:35,362
She's sleeping,

643
00:51:53,957 --> 00:51:57,017
- They've found us again! Lavagirl!
- Shh!

644
00:51:57,094 --> 00:51:59,756
If you wake her up, she'll reheat,

645
00:52:00,764 --> 00:52:02,595
She can make it,

646
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:13,642
Lavagirl, they're behind you!

647
00:52:34,198 --> 00:52:36,996
- Les go, Hurry!
- Argh!

648
00:52:39,036 --> 00:52:40,765
Is a trap!

649
00:52:42,072 --> 00:52:47,476
You can almost feel
the electricity in the air, can't you?

650
00:52:47,544 --> 00:52:52,174
This is all wrong,
Someone else's dreams are in here,

651
00:52:52,249 --> 00:52:54,376
Lights out!

652
00:53:06,964 --> 00:53:10,297
Welcome to the Dream Lair!

653
00:53:10,367 --> 00:53:13,268
I am the ruler of Planet Drool,

654
00:53:13,337 --> 00:53:16,773
No, you're not! Max is!

655
00:53:17,174 --> 00:53:20,701
Max may have dreamed it originally...

656
00:53:23,313 --> 00:53:27,010
but I am much... cooler,

657
00:53:27,751 --> 00:53:30,618
I... am Minus,

658
00:53:31,989 --> 00:53:34,184
How'd you get so powerful?

659
00:53:34,258 --> 00:53:36,419
I do a lot of reading,

660
00:53:36,493 --> 00:53:38,222
My book of dreams!

661
00:53:38,295 --> 00:53:42,527
Thas why everything's so messed up -
he's changing it!

662
00:53:42,599 --> 00:53:44,965
Electric eels,

663
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:51,808
Shocking, isn't it, Sharkboy?

664
00:53:51,875 --> 00:53:58,747
Reminds me of the time that electrical
storm blew apart your father's laboratory,

665
00:54:00,350 --> 00:54:02,477
- Where is my father?
- Hm,

666
00:54:02,553 --> 00:54:04,544
Les see,

667
00:54:08,058 --> 00:54:10,390
Check the bottom of the ocean,

668
00:54:13,397 --> 00:54:15,763
And Lavagirl...

669
00:54:15,832 --> 00:54:18,824
Once I figure out
how to freeze this planes core,

670
00:54:18,902 --> 00:54:21,462
all of your powers will disappear,

671
00:54:21,538 --> 00:54:24,405
Powers? What powers?

672
00:54:26,810 --> 00:54:30,507
And last but least, Max,

673
00:54:30,581 --> 00:54:33,778
You thought you could escape fear
by running away to dreamland,

674
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:38,753
But fear exists
in the one place you can never escape!

675
00:54:39,856 --> 00:54:41,847
Your mind!

676
00:54:43,226 --> 00:54:45,592
I will show you the true meaning of fear,

677
00:54:45,662 --> 00:54:48,722
When darkness falls,
the rest of your dreams will be destroyed

678
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:51,495
and I will rule Planet Drool,

679
00:54:51,568 --> 00:54:55,197
Blah-blah-blah, threat-threat-threat...

680
00:54:55,272 --> 00:54:59,800
You must all leave now,
I have some dreaming to do,

681
00:55:00,177 --> 00:55:01,769
Whoa!

682
00:55:09,753 --> 00:55:12,654
If I could just get my dream journal,

683
00:55:13,757 --> 00:55:16,988
I could turn everything
back to the way it was,

684
00:55:17,794 --> 00:55:20,058
My fire's dimming,

685
00:55:22,265 --> 00:55:23,960
I can't melt the bars,

686
00:55:24,034 --> 00:55:27,003
My strength is failing me as well,

687
00:55:28,505 --> 00:55:30,666
How much time do we have, Sharkboy?

688
00:55:30,741 --> 00:55:35,144
Who cares?
We're never getting out of here,

689
00:55:37,347 --> 00:55:39,406
La La's,

690
00:55:46,156 --> 00:55:47,817
They like you,

691
00:55:47,891 --> 00:55:51,258
- I don't feel distracted right now,
- I do!

692
00:55:51,328 --> 00:55:53,523
This song is driving me crazy!

693
00:55:53,597 --> 00:55:56,623
Don't worry about him,
He's a cold fish,

694
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,759
I'm serious!

695
00:55:59,569 --> 00:56:02,561
They're singing at a frequency...

696
00:56:02,639 --> 00:56:05,107
my highly trained ears find...

697
00:56:05,175 --> 00:56:06,836
disturbing!

698
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:09,276
Sing louder, Sing higher,

699
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:15,948
You don't wanna be too close to him
when he explodes,

700
00:56:17,554 --> 00:56:18,612
Aaargghh!

701
00:56:18,689 --> 00:56:20,316
Shark frenzy!

702
00:56:32,903 --> 00:56:35,371
Nice job channeling your anger, Sharkie,

703
00:56:37,541 --> 00:56:38,565
Huh,

704
00:57:06,369 --> 00:57:10,430
First things first,
Transportation out of here,

705
00:57:13,410 --> 00:57:15,378
My dreams,

706
00:57:19,382 --> 00:57:22,146
Lavagirl, you have a lava bike!

707
00:57:22,219 --> 00:57:23,709
I do?

708
00:57:24,221 --> 00:57:26,212
I do!

709
00:57:28,759 --> 00:57:30,750
This is so exciting!

710
00:57:30,827 --> 00:57:32,419
Cool it, Lavagirl,

711
00:57:32,496 --> 00:57:35,590
Everything we need
is right here in this book,

712
00:57:38,335 --> 00:57:43,864
Sharkboy... your father really is
at the bottom of the ocean,

713
00:57:51,181 --> 00:57:53,615
He's in a submarine,

714
00:57:54,251 --> 00:57:56,276
Looking for you!

715
00:57:59,089 --> 00:58:02,354
He's over the hydrothermal vents,
Mid-Atlantic Ridge,

716
00:58:02,425 --> 00:58:06,862
42 degrees west by 14 north,
Depth: 18OO meters,

717
00:58:06,930 --> 00:58:09,023
Near a snake pit!

718
00:58:09,099 --> 00:58:10,862
I need to get back to Earth,

719
00:58:10,934 --> 00:58:14,631
- Whas it say about me?
- I'm not sure what this is,

720
00:58:14,704 --> 00:58:17,832
I can figure it out, Maybe there's
a section on my true identity,

721
00:58:17,908 --> 00:58:19,899
Lavagirl, no!

722
00:58:20,911 --> 00:58:24,312
Oh, no, What have I done?

723
00:58:24,381 --> 00:58:26,645
Thas terrific, LG!

724
00:58:29,886 --> 00:58:33,754
Is OK, Lavagirl,
It was an accident,

725
00:58:34,624 --> 00:58:37,855
Why did you make me out of lava?!
Why, Max?

726
00:58:39,462 --> 00:58:43,694
Just let her cool down,
She's just blowing off steam,

727
00:58:48,405 --> 00:58:50,703
I know I can be good,

728
00:58:51,408 --> 00:58:53,535
I can feel it,

729
00:58:55,011 --> 00:58:57,878
But everything I touch, I destroy,

730
00:58:59,249 --> 00:59:04,949
Why did you make me like that?
I have more potential,

731
00:59:05,021 --> 00:59:07,148
I'm sure you do,

732
00:59:08,158 --> 00:59:12,754
And why'd you make us a team?
We're nothing alike,

733
00:59:12,829 --> 00:59:16,822
When I'm near water, I fizzle out,
When he's near heat, he shrivels,

734
00:59:16,900 --> 00:59:18,697
We're not compatible,

735
00:59:20,337 --> 00:59:23,363
Your... hair's on fire,

736
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,874
Yeah, it does that,

737
00:59:29,112 --> 00:59:31,103
Thanks, Sharkie,

738
00:59:33,850 --> 00:59:36,148
Maybe I really am evil,

739
00:59:36,853 --> 00:59:41,483
So far everything else you've dreamed
has been correct,

740
00:59:41,558 --> 00:59:44,220
Maybe I just need to learn to accept it,

741
00:59:45,562 --> 00:59:49,862
Thas it! Everything I've dreamt so far
has been correct,

742
00:59:49,933 --> 00:59:51,662
The Crystal Heart!

743
00:59:51,735 --> 00:59:57,332
Yeah, we were captured, but thas
'cause Minus doesn't want me to get it,

744
01:00:01,211 --> 01:00:03,736
We have to get back to the Ice Castle,

745
01:00:03,813 --> 01:00:06,373
1 O minutes left, We'll never make it!

746
01:00:06,449 --> 01:00:09,179
- We can do it!
- How?

747
01:00:10,086 --> 01:00:14,022
You're Sharkboy and Lavagirl,
You can do anything,

748
01:00:21,531 --> 01:00:23,499
Wake up!

749
01:00:24,467 --> 01:00:25,934
What?

750
01:00:26,002 --> 01:00:29,938
He escaped,
And he's getting the Crystal Heart,

751
01:00:30,006 --> 01:00:32,167
Shut it down, Shut it all down now!

752
01:00:32,242 --> 01:00:36,702
I did, Is on a grid system,
It takes time for the darkness to travel,

753
01:00:36,780 --> 01:00:39,374
- How soon?
- Not soon enough,

754
01:00:39,449 --> 01:00:41,883
- Then destroy him,
- How?

755
01:00:41,952 --> 01:00:47,652
By smashing his most precious dream:
Sharkboy and Lavagirl,

756
01:01:07,844 --> 01:01:10,244
Is that what you saw, Max?

757
01:01:10,313 --> 01:01:11,473
Yes,

758
01:01:11,548 --> 01:01:14,949
You'll have to climb the ice pillar and get it,

759
01:01:15,018 --> 01:01:18,852
Is as delicate as a snowflake,
so don't drop it,

760
01:01:18,922 --> 01:01:22,289
And don't touch it with your hands either -
you'll freeze,

761
01:01:22,359 --> 01:01:24,384
Use your claws,

762
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:33,066
Aaarrhh...

763
01:01:38,942 --> 01:01:41,103
Lava, can you...?

764
01:01:41,711 --> 01:01:43,736
Never mind,

765
01:01:44,447 --> 01:01:47,610
Chew on some ice, lll keep you cool,

766
01:01:53,156 --> 01:01:54,145
Hm,

767
01:02:19,849 --> 01:02:21,942
Great job, Max,

768
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:29,290
I got it!

769
01:02:36,066 --> 01:02:38,534
She's frozen solid!

770
01:02:56,519 --> 01:02:59,488
Kneel before the Ice Princess,

771
01:03:08,832 --> 01:03:12,393
You tried to steal the Crystal Heart,
Why?

772
01:03:15,839 --> 01:03:20,572
We believe it can freeze time,
Long enough for us to defeat Minus,

773
01:03:20,643 --> 01:03:25,376
My Crystal Heart cannot help you,
Only I have the power to use it,

774
01:03:25,448 --> 01:03:28,508
- Then come with us,
- She can never leave this castle,

775
01:03:28,585 --> 01:03:34,080
The crystal is the only thing
that protects our kingdom,

776
01:03:34,157 --> 01:03:36,819
Please, Princess,
We're running out of time,

777
01:03:36,893 --> 01:03:39,225
Perhaps I could give it to you,

778
01:03:39,295 --> 01:03:43,061
- Not without my blessing,
- Father, you're smothering me again,

779
01:03:44,267 --> 01:03:46,633
But are you worthy to wield it?

780
01:03:46,703 --> 01:03:48,034
Yes,

781
01:03:48,104 --> 01:03:50,732
The crystal you stole was a decoy,

782
01:03:50,807 --> 01:03:54,299
The true Crystal Heart
is somewhere in this room,

783
01:03:54,377 --> 01:03:58,541
Choose the correct one,
and you may carry it before you,

784
01:03:58,648 --> 01:04:00,343
Pick that one,

785
01:04:02,485 --> 01:04:04,476
Is around your neck,

786
01:04:07,023 --> 01:04:10,481
- How'd you know?
- I saw it in my dream,

787
01:04:11,161 --> 01:04:16,793
Usually, if you snooze, you lose,
With Max, you snooze, you win,

788
01:04:20,803 --> 01:04:25,263
But be warned, Max,
if anything happens to my Crystal Heart,

789
01:04:25,341 --> 01:04:28,799
my entire kingdom will be destroyed,

790
01:04:28,878 --> 01:04:33,008
Do you, Max, take this Crystal Heart
to have and to hold,

791
01:04:33,082 --> 01:04:36,518
in sickness and in health,
till death do you part?

792
01:04:36,586 --> 01:04:37,644
I do,

793
01:04:37,720 --> 01:04:40,120
- Do you trust him with your heart?
- I do,

794
01:04:40,190 --> 01:04:42,590
Do you mean what you say?

795
01:04:43,059 --> 01:04:44,458
Yes,

796
01:04:44,527 --> 01:04:46,427
I mean, I do,

797
01:04:46,496 --> 01:04:50,455
The crystal will now work -
but my daughter must stay here,

798
01:04:50,533 --> 01:04:52,592
Off with you, then!

799
01:04:52,669 --> 01:04:54,136
Good luck,

800
01:05:01,544 --> 01:05:04,479
We're almost at the Dream Lair!

801
01:05:04,547 --> 01:05:07,812
If we're gonna do this, we gotta do it now!

802
01:05:07,884 --> 01:05:11,684
- How much time?
- We're out of time!

803
01:05:11,754 --> 01:05:13,745
1 O seconds!

804
01:05:21,064 --> 01:05:22,088
What?

805
01:05:22,165 --> 01:05:23,792
I can't hear you,

806
01:05:23,866 --> 01:05:26,027
- Five seconds,
- Here it goes,

807
01:05:26,102 --> 01:05:29,003
Three, two, one...

808
01:05:31,808 --> 01:05:33,673
We're out of time,

809
01:05:33,743 --> 01:05:36,109
- What happened?
- It didn't work,

810
01:05:36,179 --> 01:05:38,340
How could it not work?

811
01:05:40,950 --> 01:05:44,044
I was trying to tell you! Whoa...

812
01:05:44,854 --> 01:05:46,947
Only the Ice Princess can use it,

813
01:05:47,023 --> 01:05:50,186
Is not her fault
her father won't let her leave her castle,

814
01:05:50,260 --> 01:05:51,921
Boo-hoo,

815
01:05:51,995 --> 01:05:54,190
No underwater readings,

816
01:05:55,531 --> 01:05:57,522
No anything!

817
01:06:04,641 --> 01:06:07,701
I'll rip your sockets to shreds!

818
01:06:07,777 --> 01:06:11,645
Calm down, Sharkboy,
Mr, Electric's baiting you,

819
01:06:11,714 --> 01:06:13,978
I can't... fight...

820
01:06:14,517 --> 01:06:16,542
my instincts!

821
01:06:16,619 --> 01:06:18,382
No, Sharkboy!

822
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:23,558
Hey!

823
01:06:24,327 --> 01:06:26,693
Watts... up?

824
01:06:27,230 --> 01:06:29,164
You know - watts,

825
01:06:29,666 --> 01:06:32,260
As in a measure of electrical power,

826
01:06:32,335 --> 01:06:34,803
The 6O-watt bulb?

827
01:06:34,871 --> 01:06:38,466
Watts up?

828
01:06:38,541 --> 01:06:40,008
What?

829
01:06:40,076 --> 01:06:44,342
Electric eels, Thas whas up,

830
01:06:44,414 --> 01:06:46,814
Swim away, Sharkboy! Swim away!

831
01:07:07,303 --> 01:07:09,601
Can he survive down there?

832
01:07:09,672 --> 01:07:12,903
He can hold his breath, but not forever,

833
01:07:12,975 --> 01:07:17,036
- He'll drown if I don't go get him,
- I can't let you go,

834
01:07:17,113 --> 01:07:19,138
You'll die too,

835
01:07:21,551 --> 01:07:24,042
He's my best friend,

836
01:07:46,275 --> 01:07:48,470
Come on, Sharkboy,

837
01:07:55,284 --> 01:07:57,684
Come on, Sharkboy!

838
01:08:04,894 --> 01:08:07,590
Sharkboy! Wake up, Sharkboy!

839
01:08:12,502 --> 01:08:13,867
Lavagirl!

840
01:08:14,771 --> 01:08:17,763
Lavagirl! Lavagirl, please!

841
01:08:18,641 --> 01:08:20,506
Lavagirl...

842
01:08:26,682 --> 01:08:29,116
What am I gonna do now?

843
01:08:30,853 --> 01:08:33,617
What do you think you should do?

844
01:08:35,758 --> 01:08:38,056
Dream a better dream,

845
01:08:38,127 --> 01:08:40,721
Interesting, Explain,

846
01:08:41,798 --> 01:08:47,430
I wanted all my dreams to come true,
but I only dreamt for myself,

847
01:08:47,503 --> 01:08:50,563
I wanted to escape my real world,

848
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:54,804
when the world needed my help
to make it a better place,

849
01:08:55,978 --> 01:08:58,879
Selfish dreams shouldn't come true,

850
01:08:58,981 --> 01:09:02,007
You're becoming
a very good dreamer, Max,

851
01:09:02,051 --> 01:09:04,542
A very good dreamer indeed,

852
01:09:06,789 --> 01:09:11,488
What do you do
when your dreams have been destroyed?

853
01:09:11,561 --> 01:09:14,428
Dream a better dream,

854
01:09:14,497 --> 01:09:17,432
An unselfish dream,

855
01:09:24,807 --> 01:09:28,140
She knew this would happen
if she saved you,

856
01:09:28,211 --> 01:09:30,338
But I couldn't stop her,

857
01:09:34,250 --> 01:09:35,615
Look!

858
01:09:38,154 --> 01:09:40,145
Lava,

859
01:09:41,290 --> 01:09:43,554
We have to get her to that volcano,

860
01:09:43,626 --> 01:09:46,356
I'll go, I'm stronger and faster,

861
01:09:46,429 --> 01:09:48,420
You'll burn up,

862
01:09:51,734 --> 01:09:55,932
- Sure this will save her?
- Ill do more than save her,

863
01:10:02,745 --> 01:10:05,839
I know who you are, Lavagirl,

864
01:10:06,749 --> 01:10:10,446
You are not fire, or a simple flame.

865
01:10:11,254 --> 01:10:13,848
You are greater than that.

866
01:10:13,923 --> 01:10:18,189
Something more important,
and so necessary.

867
01:10:19,161 --> 01:10:21,857
It is why you must live,

868
01:10:25,501 --> 01:10:27,799
You are not destruction,

869
01:10:36,913 --> 01:10:38,813
You are not evil,

870
01:10:48,691 --> 01:10:50,420
Stand back,

871
01:10:52,795 --> 01:10:55,662
You are... light,

872
01:11:09,111 --> 01:11:13,070
Who turned on the lights?! Oh!

873
01:11:13,816 --> 01:11:16,546
Power, everywhere!

874
01:11:31,534 --> 01:11:34,799
Whoa! How'd you get here so fast?

875
01:11:34,870 --> 01:11:38,203
Hold off Mr, Electric
while I deal with Minus,

876
01:11:38,274 --> 01:11:40,708
I'll need my fish army,

877
01:11:40,776 --> 01:11:42,903
I'll unfreeze the ocean,

878
01:11:44,914 --> 01:11:46,779
Good luck,

879
01:11:49,986 --> 01:11:52,352
I've become what you feared most...

880
01:11:52,421 --> 01:11:54,286
Minus,

881
01:11:55,324 --> 01:11:57,087
How did you get in here?

882
01:11:57,159 --> 01:12:03,098
I'm the Daydreamer,
able to dream with my eyes open,

883
01:12:03,199 --> 01:12:07,067
Hate to burst your bubble, Dream Boy,
but I read your book,

884
01:12:07,103 --> 01:12:11,096
There's not one dream you've got
that I haven't already seen,

885
01:12:11,173 --> 01:12:16,201
So what do you say?
Les blow the roof off this place,

886
01:12:20,583 --> 01:12:23,143
May the best dream win!

887
01:12:47,476 --> 01:12:48,465
Wait!

888
01:12:53,916 --> 01:12:55,781
Brainstorm!

889
01:13:09,265 --> 01:13:10,857
Eugh!

890
01:13:11,567 --> 01:13:14,035
Brain... freeze!

891
01:13:17,373 --> 01:13:19,170
Brain...

892
01:13:20,376 --> 01:13:21,638
fart!

893
01:13:25,514 --> 01:13:26,503
Oh...

894
01:13:42,231 --> 01:13:45,029
Get ready for the ultimate power outage,

895
01:13:46,869 --> 01:13:52,273
And who are you to believe
that you can defeat me now?

896
01:13:52,341 --> 01:13:54,434
No one special,

897
01:13:54,510 --> 01:13:58,344
Just... king of the ocean,

898
01:14:06,255 --> 01:14:07,688
Ooh...

899
01:14:12,027 --> 01:14:14,154
Shark frenzy,

900
01:14:14,230 --> 01:14:17,631
Aaarhh... Aaarhh... Aaarhh...

901
01:14:17,700 --> 01:14:19,065
A-ha!

902
01:14:19,635 --> 01:14:22,695
You're afraid of me, aren't you?

903
01:14:26,675 --> 01:14:28,609
I used to be,

904
01:14:32,281 --> 01:14:34,579
Someone smashed your dreams once -

905
01:14:34,650 --> 01:14:37,915
now all you can do
is smash everyone else's,

906
01:14:45,828 --> 01:14:50,128
We can create a better dream than this,
A better world,

907
01:14:50,199 --> 01:14:52,258
Don't you see?

908
01:14:58,240 --> 01:15:00,299
What do you say...

909
01:15:01,377 --> 01:15:03,368
Linus?

910
01:15:15,057 --> 01:15:17,116
Hurry!

911
01:15:17,626 --> 01:15:19,856
No!

912
01:15:23,499 --> 01:15:26,935
Don't let me fall!

913
01:15:28,971 --> 01:15:31,337
Wouldn't dream of it,

914
01:15:39,648 --> 01:15:44,312
Don't smash people's dreams, Linus,
because you'll smash your own as well,

915
01:15:44,854 --> 01:15:47,220
And you too will stop believing,

916
01:15:51,493 --> 01:15:53,688
Max!

917
01:15:53,762 --> 01:15:55,627
I am light,

918
01:15:55,698 --> 01:15:56,790
Thank you,

919
01:15:56,866 --> 01:16:00,996
You were always that,
It had nothing to do with me,

920
01:16:01,103 --> 01:16:04,300
But now I know, So thank you,

921
01:16:04,340 --> 01:16:08,834
OK, so she's a light, Big deal,

922
01:16:08,911 --> 01:16:13,177
The real news is... what I am,

923
01:16:13,249 --> 01:16:15,240
Annoying?

924
01:16:16,051 --> 01:16:18,519
King of the ocean,

925
01:16:18,587 --> 01:16:20,680
Thanks for saving me,

926
01:16:24,793 --> 01:16:26,727
Ouch,

927
01:16:26,795 --> 01:16:29,662
Everything will return
to being the way it was,

928
01:16:29,732 --> 01:16:32,895
You will be able to travel to Earth
and back again as you wish,

929
01:16:32,968 --> 01:16:36,404
You can search for your father,
You can rule Earth's lava world,

930
01:16:36,472 --> 01:16:41,409
And what am I to do,
now that you're all buddy-buddy?

931
01:16:42,144 --> 01:16:47,343
Mr, Electric can go back
to being the good electrician of the planet,

932
01:16:47,416 --> 01:16:48,849
Oh, really?

933
01:16:48,918 --> 01:16:51,250
Plugging in power cords?

934
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:54,619
Keeping this loud, obnoxious world
a happy place?

935
01:16:54,690 --> 01:16:56,180
You're dreaming!

936
01:16:56,258 --> 01:16:59,193
I dreamt you up,
and I can undream you,

937
01:16:59,295 --> 01:17:05,063
You think you can just snap your eyes
open and make me vanish? Not so easy,

938
01:17:05,100 --> 01:17:08,035
I am the danger of dreaming,

939
01:17:08,103 --> 01:17:10,970
For every person
who dreams up the electric light bulb,

940
01:17:11,040 --> 01:17:14,476
there's the one
who dreams up the atom bomb,

941
01:17:14,543 --> 01:17:16,977
This is one dream
you won't be waking up from,

942
01:17:17,046 --> 01:17:21,710
I'm gonna put an end
to this ridiculous tangent at its source!

943
01:17:23,519 --> 01:17:25,646
Where did he go?

944
01:17:26,889 --> 01:17:28,550
He's headed to Earth,

945
01:17:28,624 --> 01:17:32,390
He's going to try and destroy you
in your sleep,

946
01:17:33,329 --> 01:17:35,354
In my sleep?

947
01:17:36,966 --> 01:17:42,131
You mean I'm asleep?
All this time I've been asleep?

948
01:17:42,204 --> 01:17:45,139
No, You're dreaming, Max,

949
01:17:45,207 --> 01:17:47,300
With your eyes open,

950
01:17:47,376 --> 01:17:49,207
Make the dream real,

951
01:17:49,278 --> 01:17:54,011
You can live out your dreams on Earth,
Just like you made us real,

952
01:17:54,083 --> 01:17:55,607
Make it real,

953
01:17:55,684 --> 01:17:58,619
Blink your eyes three times,

954
01:17:58,721 --> 01:18:00,689
One...

955
01:18:00,723 --> 01:18:03,157
Wait, What happens when...?

956
01:18:03,225 --> 01:18:04,453
Two...

957
01:18:06,795 --> 01:18:08,854
Will I ever see you again?

958
01:18:08,931 --> 01:18:10,489
Three,

959
01:18:18,340 --> 01:18:22,674
Everyone follow me, I said!
We've got to find shelter!

960
01:18:23,412 --> 01:18:27,815
Max, get up!
There's a tornado heading our way!

961
01:18:29,585 --> 01:18:35,353
Is not a tornado,
Is much worse than that,

962
01:18:35,424 --> 01:18:37,551
Linus, wake up!

963
01:18:37,626 --> 01:18:39,491
Look!

964
01:18:47,603 --> 01:18:49,867
Charge!

965
01:18:49,938 --> 01:18:55,274
Is Mr, Electric from Planet Drool!
The one from my dreams!

966
01:18:55,344 --> 01:18:59,678
You mean... this is real?
Your dream is real?

967
01:18:59,782 --> 01:19:03,377
Some dreams are so powerful
they become real,

968
01:19:03,419 --> 01:19:05,216
I don't believe it,

969
01:19:05,287 --> 01:19:08,017
- Is right there in front of you!
- I can see that!

970
01:19:08,090 --> 01:19:14,586
What I can't believe is you dreamt me
as a big round bad guy! I'm not bad!

971
01:19:15,064 --> 01:19:18,556
Sorry, Kinda took on a life of its own,

972
01:19:23,272 --> 01:19:28,232
- Max is in Building C,
- No, he's not, He's in Building W,

973
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:30,870
That was the other school!

974
01:19:43,225 --> 01:19:45,125
Aaarhh!

975
01:19:45,194 --> 01:19:46,627
Help!

976
01:19:49,264 --> 01:19:51,858
Find Max! Tell him I love him!

977
01:19:52,401 --> 01:19:55,928
- Don't leave me!
- I thought you wanted me to leave,

978
01:19:56,405 --> 01:19:59,966
No, I don't, You're my best friend,

979
01:20:00,476 --> 01:20:02,307
I love you,

980
01:20:03,345 --> 01:20:04,972
I love you too,

981
01:20:05,047 --> 01:20:07,572
Aaargh!

982
01:20:09,918 --> 01:20:12,045
Come back!

983
01:20:13,489 --> 01:20:15,980
Please, come back,

984
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:28,226
I'm not going anywhere,

985
01:20:29,271 --> 01:20:31,364
Neither am I,

986
01:20:31,440 --> 01:20:33,465
Aah... Aargh!

987
01:20:35,878 --> 01:20:37,311
Uh-oh,

988
01:20:37,379 --> 01:20:39,813
Aaargghh!

989
01:20:50,626 --> 01:20:55,791
OK, class, I'm just a teacher, and
I'm here to inspire the answers from you,

990
01:20:55,864 --> 01:20:58,833
And I think thas some
pretty good inspiration outside,

991
01:20:58,934 --> 01:21:04,201
So this is now a pop quiz,
We need to defeat that guy, Any ideas?

992
01:21:05,140 --> 01:21:08,701
Wow, Linus, You get a plus
for being the first hand in the air,

993
01:21:08,777 --> 01:21:10,938
I can take him,

994
01:21:11,013 --> 01:21:12,708
Linus, watch out!

995
01:21:15,517 --> 01:21:17,485
- Poop,
- Aaargh!

996
01:21:17,553 --> 01:21:19,282
Ohh...

997
01:21:24,026 --> 01:21:25,391
Nice try,

998
01:21:25,460 --> 01:21:28,224
Sorry, Max, Your journal,

999
01:21:28,297 --> 01:21:30,891
Is OK, It was an accident,

1000
01:21:30,966 --> 01:21:33,457
Plenty more dreams
where those came from,

1001
01:21:35,304 --> 01:21:38,671
OK, kids, who's next?
Remember, there are no dumb ideas,

1002
01:21:38,740 --> 01:21:42,301
- Maybe we can freeze his circuits,
- Thas the dumbest idea I ever heard,

1003
01:21:42,377 --> 01:21:45,835
We're in the middle of Texas in August!
Next idea? Anyone but Linus,

1004
01:21:45,914 --> 01:21:49,350
Wait - thas a great idea!
Thanks, Linus,

1005
01:21:49,418 --> 01:21:51,682
Come here, Marissa,

1006
01:21:56,558 --> 01:21:58,492
Is this yours?

1007
01:21:58,594 --> 01:22:00,459
How'd you find it?

1008
01:22:00,495 --> 01:22:02,759
So you've seen this?

1009
01:22:03,365 --> 01:22:07,358
Yes, but... only in a dream,

1010
01:22:07,436 --> 01:22:11,099
- It can freeze anything,
- Even time,

1011
01:22:11,173 --> 01:22:14,506
What are you doing?
You're not sending my daughter out there,

1012
01:22:14,576 --> 01:22:15,907
Let her out,

1013
01:22:16,545 --> 01:22:19,639
Electrical storm headed your way!

1014
01:22:20,249 --> 01:22:23,412
- Do you know what to do?
- I believe so,

1015
01:22:24,086 --> 01:22:26,179
Stand back,

1016
01:22:33,228 --> 01:22:35,958
Oh, who do we have here?

1017
01:22:39,067 --> 01:22:42,525
Get ready for the mega-hurts!

1018
01:22:44,106 --> 01:22:47,041
Get it? Hertz?

1019
01:22:47,109 --> 01:22:49,942
As in the unit of electrical frequency?

1020
01:22:53,815 --> 01:22:56,978
You're just not paying attention in class,
are you?

1021
01:22:57,052 --> 01:22:58,314
Ooh!

1022
01:23:06,328 --> 01:23:09,126
Whoa! Awesome!

1023
01:23:09,197 --> 01:23:11,427
He's unplugged,

1024
01:23:11,500 --> 01:23:13,730
Yeah!

1025
01:23:28,216 --> 01:23:32,414
- You made me a great teacher today,
- How did I do that?

1026
01:23:32,487 --> 01:23:36,287
A great teacher learns as much
from his students as they do from him,

1027
01:23:36,358 --> 01:23:40,317
You have... awakened me,

1028
01:23:41,129 --> 01:23:42,960
Thank you, Max,

1029
01:24:10,592 --> 01:24:12,457
Max,

1030
01:24:12,527 --> 01:24:14,825
Your report, please,

1031
01:24:23,972 --> 01:24:26,964
The following story is true,

1032
01:24:27,576 --> 01:24:29,976
It might have started as a dream,

1033
01:24:30,045 --> 01:24:34,573
but, as we saw yesterday,
when we make our dreams a reality...

1034
01:24:35,117 --> 01:24:38,314
reality becomes a dream,

1035
01:24:39,154 --> 01:24:42,214
Sharkboy lives his dream
as king of the ocean,

1036
01:24:42,290 --> 01:24:45,259
where he cares for all its creatures.

1037
01:24:45,327 --> 01:24:49,593
He searches for his father's submarine
where there is no light -

1038
01:24:49,664 --> 01:24:55,261
except in one place, where light shines
almost as bright as the sun.

1039
01:24:55,337 --> 01:24:57,862
Is where Lavagirl lives her dream,

1040
01:24:57,973 --> 01:25:02,467
as queen of Earth's volcanoes
that boil at the bottom of the sea,

1041
01:25:02,511 --> 01:25:05,241
a force of life for all living things.

1042
01:25:06,715 --> 01:25:09,548
Sharkboy and Lavagirl
don't visit me anymore.

1043
01:25:12,454 --> 01:25:16,254
But I can visit them - in my dreams.

1044
01:25:17,325 --> 01:25:20,021
So dream a better dream...

1045
01:25:21,129 --> 01:25:23,893
then work to make it real.

1046
