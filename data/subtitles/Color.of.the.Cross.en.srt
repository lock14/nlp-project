1
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:33,921
A dog in golden armor
is still a dog.

2
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,927
What did you say?

3
00:01:36,029 --> 00:01:39,430
- He said, "Caesar is great."
- There's a curfew.

4
00:01:39,532 --> 00:01:43,024
Do not be seen
on the street again, Jew.

5
00:01:43,136 --> 00:01:46,333
But we must buy food
for Passover.

6
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,705
Buy it then,
and get off the street!

7
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:53,040
Yes. Yes.

8
00:01:53,146 --> 00:01:58,209
- If I were a younger man-
- You surely would have taught him a lesson.

9
00:02:07,594 --> 00:02:12,190
The streets are buzzing,
Caiaphas.

10
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,766
It's this time of year.

11
00:02:14,868 --> 00:02:18,702
Jews come to Jerusalem
from all the precincts.

12
00:02:20,673 --> 00:02:24,439
Did I ever tell you, Caiaphas,
I have a son?

13
00:02:24,544 --> 00:02:27,069
He's three years old.

14
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:30,149
Back in Rome. I miss him.
I want to get back to him.

15
00:02:32,685 --> 00:02:36,416
It is your job to keep the peace
here in Arimathea.

16
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,393
What are you trying
to tell me?

17
00:02:42,495 --> 00:02:45,828
My soldiers have arrested
four troublemakers-

18
00:02:45,932 --> 00:02:50,426
so-called,
um, prophets.

19
00:02:51,471 --> 00:02:53,530
Do you understand me?

20
00:02:55,275 --> 00:03:00,212
If I hear of someone else,
I'll hand them over to you.

21
00:03:02,882 --> 00:03:07,581
You have...
no power to arrest.

22
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:13,919
How does it feel,
a Jew handing over a Jew...

23
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,995
to Roman authorities?

24
00:03:20,233 --> 00:03:22,292
It doesn't feel good.

25
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:28,898
But my responsibility
is to protect the law of our people...

26
00:03:29,008 --> 00:03:31,340
the law of God.

27
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,681
And if I'm wrong...

28
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:39,343
and one of those prophets
is the real Messiah...

29
00:03:42,088 --> 00:03:44,852
let history judge me.

30
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,222
Let history judge.

31
00:03:49,028 --> 00:03:50,996
Hmm.

32
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:06,640
Lord, what have we done
to deserve such a fate?

33
00:04:07,747 --> 00:04:10,307
For heaven's sake!

34
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:13,751
- What's wrong?
- Gamaliel.

35
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:16,321
Must he be late
on a day like this?

36
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,322
It's not his nature
to be late.

37
00:04:18,424 --> 00:04:20,517
Well, this is not
a day to start.

38
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:25,997
But the Roman soldiers are everywhere.
Maybe we should consider his safety first.

39
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:30,229
I'm sure he's safe.
It's just that...

40
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:35,467
Isaiah prophesied that the Messiah
would come during these times.

41
00:04:35,575 --> 00:04:38,271
Why won't the other rabbis
just accept that?

42
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:43,281
Do you believe that
this dark-skinned Nazarene is really him?

43
00:04:43,383 --> 00:04:46,944
I-I don't know, Nicodemus.

44
00:04:47,053 --> 00:04:49,521
But one thing
I am sure of.

45
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:54,025
If this Joshua
is indeed the Messiah...

46
00:04:58,231 --> 00:05:00,722
I fear we may be too late.

47
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:21,177
Arimathea.

48
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:25,451
My deliverance
shall happen here, my brother.

49
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:29,484
Today begins Passover,
master.

50
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:33,258
The Romans would not dare
violate this holy holiday.

51
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:36,802
Peter, to those who seek to harm
the Messiah, today is just another day.

52
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:41,033
I don't believe the Romans
would want to disturb the peace.

53
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,473
I'm afraid Thaddeus
may be right, Peter.

54
00:05:44,577 --> 00:05:48,445
<i>Are we there yet, master?</i>
<i>I'm tired, and I can't journey much farther.</i>

55
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:50,607
Too much complaining
from you.

56
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:57,219
Perhaps we should carry
this young girl into Arimathea.

57
00:05:57,323 --> 00:05:59,416
- Come on.
- Let's go.

58
00:06:33,259 --> 00:06:35,591
Hide, quickly!

59
00:06:39,499 --> 00:06:43,128
Rabbi, why hide?
Those dogs are outnumbered.

60
00:06:43,236 --> 00:06:48,299
He who lives by the sword,
Judas, dies by the sword.

61
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:53,171
Good.
All right.

62
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,823
Up. Up. Let us go.
John, come quickly. Quickly. Quick.

63
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:12,159
I want you to go down
into Arimathea...

64
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:14,790
and set up preparation
for the Passover meal.

65
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:18,928
But, master, the centurion guards
are all over Arimathea.

66
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:21,438
Shouldn't we have the feast
somewhere more secure?

67
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,237
Do you question
my love for you, John?

68
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,039
Do you think
I would place you in harm's way?

69
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:29,046
- No. I-
- Then go.

70
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:32,015
And trust in me.

71
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,143
- I'm sorry, master.
- Good.

72
00:07:34,253 --> 00:07:40,021
Now, when you enter town, you'll observe
a man carrying a pitcher of water.

73
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,026
You will follow him
to his house.

74
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:44,892
There, you will ask
the goodman of the house.

75
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:47,761
Tell him that the Son
of God has sent you...

76
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:52,531
and wishes to know where he shall eat
the Passover meal with his disciples.

77
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:56,199
Okay, go. Wait.
Leave this.

78
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:03,376
Quickly, quickly.
Go, go, go.

79
00:08:03,483 --> 00:08:06,077
- Yes, master.
- <i>Quickly, quickly!</i>

80
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:12,147
My Father will protect them.
Come.

81
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:23,431
Papa, mother said you'd
have the chair fixed before feast time.

82
00:08:23,536 --> 00:08:26,266
Don't worry. I'll get to it.
By the way, where is your mother?

83
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:29,637
She's at market, Papa.
But it's almost sundown...

84
00:08:29,742 --> 00:08:32,176
and we have all the <i>chametz</i>
to still remove from this place...

85
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:34,542
and so many preparations
to do before then.

86
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:37,514
Lord, the one trait my daughters inherit
from their mother-

87
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:41,075
- They worry too much.
- <i>Papa, I'm sorry.</i>

88
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:44,247
Don't worry,
my dear daughter.

89
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,383
Will you be having seder
with us tonight?

90
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:51,122
No, Papa. Ruth and I must be
with our husbands.

91
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,562
We have only come
to help Mama.

92
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:57,693
I marry off my daughters, and
now they have no time for me.

93
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:03,808
Mmm, matzo!

94
00:09:06,145 --> 00:09:09,114
Ezra!
You know that's for seder.

95
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:13,015
- But I'm hungry now, Leah!
- Ah!

96
00:09:13,119 --> 00:09:16,816
Ezra, what do you think
God thinks of such disrespectful behavior?

97
00:09:16,923 --> 00:09:20,586
- Sorry, Papa.
- You go wash up so you and Father...

98
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:22,923
<i>can dip yourselves</i>
<i>in holy water before you eat.</i>

99
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:27,398
That's right, Son. The <i>mikvah</i>,
a very important ritual in our religion.

100
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,962
Hi, Papa.
Where's Mama?

101
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,038
She's out to market.

102
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:38,173
- May I ask you a question, Papa?
- Sure, Son.

103
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:44,281
- It's about Joshua.
- Continue.

104
00:09:44,383 --> 00:09:46,578
I am a young man now...

105
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:51,180
and I know that you have done
everything to protect us.

106
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:56,318
But I was thinking,
maybe I should join Joshua.

107
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:59,592
<i>Out of the question.</i>
<i>It would break your mother's heart.</i>

108
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:04,693
I understand that he has
a prophecy to fulfill.

109
00:10:04,804 --> 00:10:09,036
But why didn't
he include me?

110
00:10:09,141 --> 00:10:12,269
Let me explain, James.

111
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:16,280
Your older brother
loves you very much...

112
00:10:16,382 --> 00:10:19,943
but these are
dangerous times...

113
00:10:20,052 --> 00:10:24,853
and he understands
his sacrifice is his alone.

114
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:29,459
Do you understand?

115
00:10:29,562 --> 00:10:31,962
Yes, Papa.

116
00:10:32,064 --> 00:10:34,055
I understand.

117
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:38,034
In time,
your role will come.

118
00:10:48,981 --> 00:10:50,972
Pardon my delay.
On my way here, I was delayed.

119
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,779
- Roman soldiers?
- Who else?

120
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,786
More came to town,
doubling their numbers.

121
00:10:55,888 --> 00:10:58,914
They're relentless in their search
for the black Nazarene.

122
00:10:59,025 --> 00:11:01,459
Rumor is he's hiding
somewhere in the hills.

123
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:05,257
- It may take weeks for them to find him.
- This is no good.

124
00:11:05,364 --> 00:11:08,162
- <i>What is wrong?</i>
- We have been informed that there will be...

125
00:11:08,267 --> 00:11:12,260
an emergency meeting of the entire
Sanhedrin body tonight.

126
00:11:12,371 --> 00:11:15,306
- But I was not informed of any-
- Hear me, Gamaliel.

127
00:11:15,408 --> 00:11:18,935
The entire membership
is being contacted as we speak.

128
00:11:19,045 --> 00:11:21,946
They think they're near
to capture this Nazarene.

129
00:11:22,048 --> 00:11:25,677
- It may be as early as tonight.
- But how?

130
00:11:25,785 --> 00:11:30,119
- Caiaphas has eyes everywhere.
- <i>You mean he hired a spy?</i>

131
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:33,783
Yes. One of
the Nazarene's disciples.

132
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:38,421
<i>And our fear is that this man's capture</i>
<i>may lead to more violence on the streets.</i>

133
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,800
You both know how I feel
about this carpenter.

134
00:11:44,837 --> 00:11:47,670
I have heard him lecture before.

135
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:50,139
He knows the Torah
better than most rabbis I know.

136
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:53,211
I find him to be
a very learned man.

137
00:11:55,214 --> 00:11:58,445
But he's black,
and to say...

138
00:11:58,551 --> 00:12:01,520
that he is the Messiah,
it is blasphemy.

139
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:04,680
The Torah does not mention
as to what he will look like.

140
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:10,558
Not to mention that he is still a Jew,
regardless of his skin color.

141
00:12:25,978 --> 00:12:28,446
Passover.

142
00:12:28,547 --> 00:12:31,072
The worst time of year.

143
00:12:31,183 --> 00:12:34,050
What's next for you,
Horatius?

144
00:12:34,153 --> 00:12:36,621
Ah.

145
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:40,852
Keep the peace for
seven days in Arimathea...

146
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,225
then I go back
to my beloved Rome, eh?

147
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,592
<i>Jews.</i>

148
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:52,830
You cannot trust them.

149
00:13:03,249 --> 00:13:06,980
- Look. He carries water.
- <i>He carries carpet.</i>

150
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:11,682
Perhaps our master
should heal your eyes. There.

151
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,227
<i>There is the servant</i>
<i>we are to follow. Come.</i>

152
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:23,594
In a hurry, citizens?

153
00:13:23,702 --> 00:13:25,670
Only to get my friend
out of this heat.

154
00:13:25,771 --> 00:13:29,002
He sure is to collapse if
I don't get him home quickly.

155
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:33,010
He speaks the truth.
The feast will bring me welcome relief.

156
00:13:33,112 --> 00:13:37,378
Don't let me see you again,
lest you celebrate your feast in chains.

157
00:13:44,456 --> 00:13:47,857
My friend, might I ask
if we could get a message to your master?

158
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,860
- I'm sorry. I cannot help you.
- Please!

159
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,931
Our master has sent us.
The Messiah.

160
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:58,036
Wait here.

161
00:14:09,181 --> 00:14:11,081
Yes?
Can I help you?

162
00:14:12,451 --> 00:14:14,351
Our master has sent us
with a message.

163
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:16,387
And what is the message?

164
00:14:16,488 --> 00:14:20,219
He wishes to know where
he will eat the Passover meal with his disciples.

165
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:25,456
Come, quickly.
Come!

166
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:45,146
Please.

167
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:47,913
Is it all right?
Is it good?

168
00:14:48,020 --> 00:14:51,353
Yes. Thank you for
opening your home to us.

169
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:56,485
- We apologize for any inconvenience.
- Oh, please, not to worry.

170
00:14:56,595 --> 00:14:58,961
Let the Messiah know
that I am humbly grateful...

171
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:02,363
that he has chosen
my home for his seder meal.

172
00:15:02,468 --> 00:15:05,266
- I will tell him.
- Thank you.

173
00:15:46,912 --> 00:15:48,812
We camp here.

174
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,918
We camp here!

175
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:01,825
Why here, rabbi?

176
00:16:01,927 --> 00:16:04,862
Open, clean space
to honor the Passover.

177
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,666
What's wrong, Peter?

178
00:16:15,774 --> 00:16:18,937
I'm tired of running around
like rats...

179
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:21,945
having to hide
in these mountains...

180
00:16:22,047 --> 00:16:26,108
not being able to sleep in one place
for more than one night.

181
00:16:26,218 --> 00:16:30,154
We knew there'd be
a price to pay for the truth, Peter.

182
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:34,658
At least if it was Romans,
there'd be some excuse.

183
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,560
But not Jews, rabbis.

184
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:44,762
Blessed are ye
when men shall persecute you.

185
00:16:46,138 --> 00:16:48,538
We have enough water
to last us till tomorrow...

186
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:50,540
some sheep,
some dried fish.

187
00:16:50,642 --> 00:16:53,839
Good, good.
Take Simon with you.

188
00:16:53,946 --> 00:16:55,914
Patrol the hillside.

189
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,779
Make sure
everything's safe.

190
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,784
Simon!

191
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:05,550
- Rabbi, I'm still-
- Not to worry, Peter.

192
00:17:05,657 --> 00:17:08,023
My Father
has led us here.

193
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,762
Fine.

194
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:15,197
After we have pitched tent,
gather the rest.

195
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,739
Yes, master.

196
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,140
Make sure the sheep are fed.

197
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,751
He's a wild one, master.

198
00:17:43,495 --> 00:17:46,293
Such beautiful fur.

199
00:17:46,398 --> 00:17:50,232
If only mankind would embrace
that which is different-

200
00:17:52,871 --> 00:17:54,839
black sheep.

201
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,646
<i>Bring more water.</i>

202
00:18:16,695 --> 00:18:18,526
Philip.

203
00:18:18,630 --> 00:18:21,599
Thank you.

204
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,931
We've been traveling all night. Who do you
think gets to sleep in the tent tonight?

205
00:18:25,037 --> 00:18:27,699
The sheep, Philip.

206
00:18:32,744 --> 00:18:35,713
- Hold that steady, Matthew.
- For heaven's sake, don't miss!

207
00:18:35,814 --> 00:18:38,078
Your right hand, Matthew,
has always been a bit useless.

208
00:18:38,183 --> 00:18:40,777
Perhaps if I miss, he'll be able
to develop the left.

209
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:45,380
Real funny, Thaddeus.
Hey, can you people help us?

210
00:18:45,491 --> 00:18:48,722
It is not fair that only two people set up
the tent while the rest watch.

211
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:51,352
No, Matthew's right.

212
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,728
He shouldn't be the only one
to get his finger crushed.

213
00:18:56,935 --> 00:19:00,837
Two feet, one hand, no brain.
He's a centurion guard.

214
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:07,170
Thaddeus has a reputation in Jerusalem
for breaking hands.

215
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,510
Look! Even my hand was broken.

216
00:19:10,616 --> 00:19:13,210
That's for not paying
your taxes.

217
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:18,749
Stay there, Matthew.
I'll crush your hand later.

218
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:21,655
Matthew is right.
We must all help.

219
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:25,355
Good neighbors. It reminds me
of a story our master told us.

220
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:27,830
- The story of the Good Samaritan.
- Oh, come on!

221
00:19:27,933 --> 00:19:30,060
- Get out with the story.
- It worked for our master.

222
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,069
The master's
a better storyteller than you.

223
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:36,335
Yes, that is true.
But I'm a better cook.

224
00:19:36,441 --> 00:19:38,272
<i>That's not funny.</i>

225
00:19:47,819 --> 00:19:50,083
Why so quiet,
Bartholomew?

226
00:19:53,158 --> 00:19:55,922
I really love these times.

227
00:19:59,998 --> 00:20:01,863
<i>I understand.</i>

228
00:20:04,736 --> 00:20:07,398
You know,
the beauty of family...

229
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:11,237
is that when I first
started following our master...

230
00:20:11,343 --> 00:20:13,709
I had just one brother.

231
00:20:15,747 --> 00:20:18,875
Now I have 12.

232
00:20:24,856 --> 00:20:27,222
Come. Come on.

233
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:34,158
Come, quickly.
Hurry.

234
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:36,234
Hurry.

235
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:42,601
- Were you two followed?
- We were extra careful and took a back road.

236
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,801
- Good.
- Where is our master?

237
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,470
He's in prayer.
He's waiting for you. Come quickly.

238
00:20:55,621 --> 00:20:57,521
<i>Quickly!</i>

239
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:28,453
Come.

240
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:34,158
Sorry to bother you,
master.

241
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,295
My Father...

242
00:21:38,397 --> 00:21:41,628
can be very selfish
with our daily conversations.

243
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:47,296
What news do you bring?

244
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:52,207
The goodman has sent word that he would
be honored to have your presence in his home.

245
00:21:55,013 --> 00:21:56,981
Good.

246
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,718
Gather the rest.

247
00:22:17,135 --> 00:22:19,933
<i>If I don't leave now, I'll definitely be late</i>
<i>for</i> Mikvah. <i>Come, James.</i>

248
00:22:20,038 --> 00:22:23,974
- Hurry.
- You all be sure to be careful.

249
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:29,506
- Please.
- Don't worry. We'll be careful.

250
00:22:29,614 --> 00:22:33,880
- James, take Ezra into the courtyard, please.
- Yes, Father. Come.

251
00:22:33,985 --> 00:22:38,445
Look, Mary, we can't change what is.
I know how you're feeling.

252
00:22:38,557 --> 00:22:42,926
I would like him here as much as you.
But he's not ours anymore.

253
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:45,963
But I feel it is we
who have led him down this path.

254
00:22:46,064 --> 00:22:50,797
Stop blaming yourself for what is happening.
We knew this day would come.

255
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:55,532
Nothing can prepare a mother
for something like this, Joseph.

256
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,835
Thirty-three years ago,
you told me...

257
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:00,411
that you felt something
happening inside of you...

258
00:23:00,512 --> 00:23:03,640
and I truly believe that God
did touch you that night.

259
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,649
Somehow,
something divine happened...

260
00:23:05,751 --> 00:23:11,212
and you were chosen among all the women
of Judea to carry the chosen one.

261
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:17,824
Do you think they're
doing this because he's black?

262
00:23:17,929 --> 00:23:19,829
No.

263
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:23,492
They're doing this
because he's the Messiah.

264
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:38,179
<i>Master, may I ask you a question?</i>

265
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:40,342
You may, Thomas.

266
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:43,387
How does it feel...

267
00:23:43,488 --> 00:23:45,615
to be different?

268
00:23:49,494 --> 00:23:54,329
In my Father's eyes, Thomas,
we are all different...

269
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,492
yet we are all the same.

270
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:04,970
<i>My mother,</i>
<i>a very glorious woman...</i>

271
00:24:05,076 --> 00:24:07,340
when she was pregnant
with child-

272
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:10,006
With you, master?

273
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:13,482
I'm afraid so.

274
00:24:13,585 --> 00:24:17,851
She was denied lodging
at a local inn in Bethlehem...

275
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:21,687
because she was
so different.

276
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:26,753
She was forced
to give birth in a manger.

277
00:24:26,865 --> 00:24:28,765
I'm sorry.

278
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:31,131
Why are you sorry,
Thomas?

279
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:34,000
Because I-I understand.

280
00:24:34,105 --> 00:24:36,972
Because I am a poor fisherman...

281
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:40,670
and I've been mistreated
because of it.

282
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,940
My Father was right.

283
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:45,608
We are all the same.

284
00:24:45,717 --> 00:24:47,776
But you will find...

285
00:24:47,886 --> 00:24:50,286
that when
you are righteous...

286
00:24:50,388 --> 00:24:53,380
kings will find you...

287
00:24:53,492 --> 00:24:57,189
and kneel at your feet.

288
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:59,263
Come.

289
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:16,237
Come. Come.

290
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,475
Master, what if they catch us?

291
00:25:21,586 --> 00:25:24,350
Then it would be
my Father's will, Thaddeus.

292
00:25:43,608 --> 00:25:49,171
Thank you, Messiah, for gracing our home
with your presence.

293
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,374
I am humbled.

294
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,451
You are blessed.

295
00:25:56,254 --> 00:25:58,722
Stand.

296
00:25:58,823 --> 00:26:01,451
- Show me to your master.
- Yes.

297
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:16,301
A blessing is upon you,
goodman.

298
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,501
Shall you share
a feast with us?

299
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:22,671
I would like nothing better, rabbi,
but this is your time, and I dare not intrude.

300
00:26:22,781 --> 00:26:25,579
Besides, I must go downstairs
and watch the door.

301
00:26:25,684 --> 00:26:29,450
My servant here will assist
in anything else you may need.

302
00:26:29,554 --> 00:26:31,522
Thank you.

303
00:28:11,489 --> 00:28:14,117
- <i>You see, my brothers, God has provided.</i>
- <i>Yes.</i>

304
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:17,524
<i>You remember? Like the Egyptians.</i>

305
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:20,723
<i>Pass him the wine.</i>
<i>Then pass the wine to me.</i>

306
00:28:27,906 --> 00:28:32,275
Today, my loved ones...

307
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:36,279
we sit together in remembrance
of our exodus as Jews...

308
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:39,748
from slavery in Egypt.

309
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:45,255
<i>My Father instructed</i>
<i>the Israelites of old...</i>

310
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:48,757
to place the blood of a virgin lamb
on their doorpost...

311
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:53,729
<i>and only then, the plague</i>
<i>smiting the firstborn in all of Egypt...</i>

312
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,493
<i>would pass over them.</i>

313
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,969
Today, and for seven days...

314
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:04,303
we sit in remembrance
of this glorious Passover.

315
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:09,108
<i>But there is another reason...</i>

316
00:29:09,214 --> 00:29:11,307
<i>we have gathered tonight.</i>

317
00:29:15,353 --> 00:29:18,516
Verily I say unto you...

318
00:29:18,623 --> 00:29:20,648
one of you shall betray me.

319
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,989
- What?
- No!

320
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,294
Earlier in the garden...

321
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:33,894
my Father spoke with me
and told me...

322
00:29:34,005 --> 00:29:37,964
that one of you that dips in the sop
with me shall betray me.

323
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:39,976
<i>No, master.</i>

324
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:43,377
It's impossible.
Everyone at this table loves you.

325
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:50,046
- Do you call my Father a liar, Thomas?
- <i>No.</i>

326
00:29:50,155 --> 00:29:54,455
- Master, who is this traitor?
- Is it me, master?

327
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:59,724
- Is it me, master?
- Who would do this?

328
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:05,235
His hands are indeed
at this table.

329
00:30:06,337 --> 00:30:09,067
Whoever this traitor be...

330
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:12,507
<i>let him reveal himself now...</i>

331
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:15,909
<i>before any harm</i>
<i>comes to our master.</i>

332
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:21,611
<i>For soon, I promise you that man by whom</i>
<i>the Son of man is betrayed...</i>

333
00:30:21,719 --> 00:30:24,552
will wish he had
never been born.

334
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:28,683
How do we know
the traitor isn't you, Peter?

335
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:30,693
Me?

336
00:30:34,265 --> 00:30:36,358
<i>Peter, don't!</i>

337
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:40,267
<i>I question you, Thomas,</i>
<i>for whom it came so hard...</i>

338
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:43,101
<i>to accept the Messiah</i>
<i>in the first place.</i>

339
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:52,744
Do you really wish
to kill me, Peter?

340
00:30:55,119 --> 00:30:57,917
- Master.
- Please stop this.

341
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:02,254
Peter, enough.

342
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:08,899
My Father shall deal with
the traitor in his own way.

343
00:31:24,816 --> 00:31:29,185
All I needed was
a little more time.

344
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:34,381
But my hour draws near.

345
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:38,622
We don't understand, master.

346
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:44,132
You have always been
so naive, John.

347
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:49,639
<i>You will come to understand</i>
<i>that through my death...</i>

348
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:53,074
will come much life.

349
00:31:54,879 --> 00:31:57,746
The sins of the world
will be washed away.

350
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:03,412
We all love you, master, and I believe
every man here would give his life for you.

351
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:06,388
Master, we have all
loved you for years.

352
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:09,688
What makes you think that we would ever,
ever do anything to hurt you?

353
00:32:10,795 --> 00:32:14,322
Nonsense!
Absolute nonsense!

354
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:17,833
- Do you think you love him more than us, Peter?
- Not more than I!

355
00:32:17,936 --> 00:32:22,635
<i>I love him more</i>
<i>than any of you ever will.</i>

356
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:34,483
The black Nazarene
and his followers take a noisy feast.

357
00:32:34,585 --> 00:32:38,715
There is a reward
for his capture. Come.

358
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:46,090
Tell us, master,
who among us loves you more...

359
00:32:46,197 --> 00:32:51,260
and who in death shall be next to you
in your Father's kingdom?

360
00:32:52,937 --> 00:32:57,397
James, how can you ask
the Messiah such a question?

361
00:32:57,508 --> 00:33:00,500
We've all been
thinking about it...

362
00:33:00,611 --> 00:33:03,444
whispering it among
ourselves for weeks now.

363
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:05,846
I think we have
a right to know.

364
00:33:07,885 --> 00:33:12,379
Let him speak.
Continue, James.

365
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,687
Master, it is clear
you love us all.

366
00:33:15,793 --> 00:33:20,594
But we wish to know,
who is the greatest among us 12?

367
00:33:22,633 --> 00:33:25,761
Greatest?

368
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:30,239
For who is greater,
he that sits at the table...

369
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:34,437
<i>or he that serves?</i>

370
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:39,380
He who is greatest among you
shall be the one who chooses to serve.

371
00:33:42,286 --> 00:33:46,586
And I will appoint unto him,
that servant...

372
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:50,286
a kingdom as my Father
has given to me.

373
00:33:52,764 --> 00:33:55,699
After I am gone...

374
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,963
you will continue
to serve mankind...

375
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:02,335
with the teachings
I have given you.

376
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:06,206
Then and only then...

377
00:34:06,310 --> 00:34:09,108
will you share
in my glory.

378
00:34:12,283 --> 00:34:15,719
Remove your sandals...

379
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,789
so that I
may wash your feet.

380
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:26,181
I know you love me, Judas.

381
00:35:43,274 --> 00:35:46,300
Do you not obey
your master, Peter?

382
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:52,315
Master, I will never
let you wash my feet.

383
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:58,322
If I do not
wash your feet, Peter...

384
00:35:58,422 --> 00:36:02,051
<i>then you will have</i>
<i>no part of me.</i>

385
00:36:04,962 --> 00:36:09,399
In that case,
don't just wash my feet.

386
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,833
Wash my hands and my head
as well...

387
00:36:12,937 --> 00:36:15,701
so that I may have
all of you.

388
00:36:18,209 --> 00:36:23,545
You need only wash your feet,
Peter, and you are clean.

389
00:36:27,151 --> 00:36:30,814
But some of you
will never be clean.

390
00:36:41,432 --> 00:36:45,129
Some say he shows the tendencies
of a cult leader.

391
00:36:45,236 --> 00:36:48,535
But possibly,
he is the Messiah.

392
00:36:48,639 --> 00:36:53,770
<i>But, Nicodemus, how can you abandon</i>
<i>the teachings of the Torah and even suggest that?</i>

393
00:36:53,878 --> 00:36:55,903
I said possibly.

394
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:58,914
A prophet he might be...

395
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:02,543
but a Messiah as foretold
by the Torah?

396
00:37:02,653 --> 00:37:06,987
The very Torah tells us the Messiah
will descend from the line of David.

397
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:10,720
- And so?
- And this man is from that very lineage.

398
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:13,126
- As were countless others.
- But he was also born in Bethlehem...

399
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:15,756
as was foretold
by the prophets.

400
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:27,271
<i>Rabbis, these two have word</i>
<i>where the black Nazarene has taken refuge.</i>

401
00:37:30,681 --> 00:37:32,774
- It that true?
- <i>Yes, rabbi.</i>

402
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:35,078
We've seen him
with our own eyes.

403
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:38,747
- <i>I've already notified the prefect.</i>
- You may leave us.

404
00:37:38,856 --> 00:37:41,848
Tell us what you have seen.

405
00:37:41,959 --> 00:37:45,622
There's a small matter of reward
for information on the false prophet.

406
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:50,531
Five pieces of silver if your information
leads us to the man we seek.

407
00:37:53,337 --> 00:37:57,103
- The Nazarene travels with 12 followers.
- Are they armed?

408
00:37:57,208 --> 00:38:01,702
Forgive me, fellow rabbis, but perhaps
we should notify Caiaphas immediately.

409
00:38:01,812 --> 00:38:03,803
Caiaphas will be quick
to respond.

410
00:38:03,914 --> 00:38:07,008
We need to know if they are armed,
lest we send soldiers to seize them...

411
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,949
that may be overpowered
and slaughtered.

412
00:38:09,053 --> 00:38:11,317
Do you want their blood
on your hands, Gamaliel?

413
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:26,100
This day may be
our last Passover together.

414
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:33,636
It is just a matter of time
before I am captured and killed.

415
00:38:33,744 --> 00:38:38,408
<i>They'll be met with swords</i>
<i>before we let that happen.</i>

416
00:38:38,516 --> 00:38:40,541
It is too late, Peter.

417
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:50,886
This is the cup of my blood...

418
00:38:53,197 --> 00:38:57,395
the blood
of the everlasting life.

419
00:39:00,404 --> 00:39:04,340
It will be given up for you...

420
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,410
and for all men.

421
00:39:08,946 --> 00:39:12,848
Do this in memory of me.

422
00:39:30,167 --> 00:39:32,863
<i>I shall not drink again...</i>

423
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:38,907
<i>until it is fulfilled</i>
<i>in my Father's kingdom.</i>

424
00:41:04,762 --> 00:41:06,992
This bread...

425
00:41:09,934 --> 00:41:12,801
is not just bread.

426
00:41:12,903 --> 00:41:14,803
It is my body...

427
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:17,931
which shall be
given up for you.

428
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,439
Share in my flesh.

429
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:46,252
Have any of you seen
a black Jew?

430
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:50,094
He travels with a dozen men.

431
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:56,138
A black Jew?
I've seen no black Jews.

432
00:42:57,341 --> 00:43:00,276
Search the house, hmm?

433
00:43:11,622 --> 00:43:14,250
Where are they, hmm?

434
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:20,694
<i>Under penalty of death,</i>
<i>you'd best answer in truth.</i>

435
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:25,060
<i>If I find</i>
<i>that you are lying-</i>

436
00:43:25,169 --> 00:43:28,935
On my word, soldier,
I've seen no one.

437
00:43:29,039 --> 00:43:32,634
We were just having
Passover dinner.

438
00:43:32,743 --> 00:43:35,337
My Father speaks the truth,
really.

439
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,210
<i>There's no one like that here.</i>
<i>Please.</i>

440
00:43:38,315 --> 00:43:42,775
<i>Horatius, we've searched</i>
<i>the house. Nothing.</i>

441
00:43:42,886 --> 00:43:47,380
I promise to seek you out
if I should see him. Please.

442
00:43:51,261 --> 00:43:53,957
Jews.

443
00:43:54,064 --> 00:43:56,396
Go!

444
00:44:07,011 --> 00:44:09,878
<i>Father, what's so special</i>
<i>about tonight?</i>

445
00:44:09,980 --> 00:44:14,417
'Cause on this night, we celebrate
our freedom as Jews, each of us...

446
00:44:14,518 --> 00:44:18,181
as though Moses had led us
out of the wilderness only yesterday.

447
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:24,052
Where is he?

448
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:26,561
<i>We have not seen him!</i>

449
00:44:26,664 --> 00:44:29,030
- <i>You lie!</i>
- He is my son, yes.

450
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:32,694
But do you see him
here with us?

451
00:44:32,803 --> 00:44:35,829
We gave him up
a long time ago.

452
00:44:35,939 --> 00:44:39,500
- Search the house!
- Yes, Horatius.

453
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:43,579
It has begun.

454
00:44:43,681 --> 00:44:47,777
Our time left here
is short, my loved ones.

455
00:44:47,885 --> 00:44:49,785
We must leave quickly.

456
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:53,448
<i>We will see you</i>
<i>safely, master.</i>

457
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:57,994
Peter. Peter, Satan demanded
to have you...

458
00:44:58,095 --> 00:45:00,222
so that he may sift
through you like wheat.

459
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,265
But I pray for you.

460
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:07,303
It never will.
You have my word, rabbi.

461
00:45:07,404 --> 00:45:10,066
<i>I'll always be by your side.</i>

462
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:17,139
What if I told you...

463
00:45:17,247 --> 00:45:21,206
that before the rooster
crows twice tonight...

464
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:24,378
you shall betray
knowing me three times?

465
00:45:24,488 --> 00:45:26,683
- Peter deny you, Lord?
- <i>How could Peter?</i>

466
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:29,554
I'd see any of us deny you
before Peter.

467
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:33,061
Please.
Please, master.

468
00:45:33,163 --> 00:45:36,326
<i>Don't tell me this.</i>

469
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:39,664
But I shall pray for you.

470
00:45:41,205 --> 00:45:44,663
<i>How can Peter's faith</i>
<i>be shaken?</i>

471
00:45:44,775 --> 00:45:48,040
I don't understand this.

472
00:45:48,145 --> 00:45:51,080
You will all fall away.

473
00:45:51,181 --> 00:45:53,615
Master.

474
00:45:55,953 --> 00:45:58,251
I saw the goodman in the house
allow him in...

475
00:45:58,355 --> 00:46:01,586
with half of his group
still in watch.

476
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:05,458
Rabbis. They make
their Passover right now.

477
00:46:05,562 --> 00:46:09,828
You must send soldiers for them quickly
before they can escape.

478
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:14,267
It is true, Joseph of Arimathea,
Nicodemus, we really should.

479
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:17,135
Must I hear from the Romans
the black Nazarene has been found?

480
00:46:17,241 --> 00:46:19,766
<i>The truth.</i>

481
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:22,778
Yes, Rabbi Caiaphas.
It is true.

482
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,780
These two have seen him.

483
00:46:24,882 --> 00:46:29,012
- <i>I kept insisting we should bring him in.</i>
- Is this true?

484
00:46:30,888 --> 00:46:34,790
- Yes.
- We believe it is him.

485
00:46:36,493 --> 00:46:39,792
This impostor is a threat
to all of us.

486
00:46:41,832 --> 00:46:45,529
Gamaliel, order the guard
to take five soldiers...

487
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:50,733
and follow this man to the house wherein
hides this blasphemer.

488
00:47:00,584 --> 00:47:03,747
This way! We are going to get
the false prophet! Hurry!

489
00:47:03,854 --> 00:47:07,290
Quickly, master, this way.

490
00:47:09,026 --> 00:47:11,051
Go.

491
00:47:17,301 --> 00:47:22,898
You'll feel the lash man's whip
for this, goodman. Hmm?

492
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:24,974
Gladly.

493
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:29,237
Go.
Go, go, go.

494
00:47:32,115 --> 00:47:37,348
- What's wrong, Judas?
- Rabbi, maybe I should pick up
some supplies for us.

495
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:42,050
Where shall you and the rest meet
that I may find you?

496
00:47:42,159 --> 00:47:44,753
Gethsemane.

497
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:48,264
I love you, master.

498
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:56,167
Judas, your way
is not my way...

499
00:47:56,273 --> 00:47:59,071
but you go do
what you must do.

500
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:04,809
<i>Go.</i>
<i>Go, go.</i>

501
00:48:04,915 --> 00:48:08,783
Master, is it him?

502
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:12,686
- <i>Judas.</i>
- Judas!

503
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:16,657
Yet, you let him steal
all our donations...

504
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,024
and run off
to betray you.

505
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:27,003
What is to be fulfilled,
we cannot stop. Go.

506
00:48:34,778 --> 00:48:37,645
It is too late.
They've disappeared into the darkness.

507
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:40,649
Marcus, you take several soldiers.
Head towards the east, the hillsides.

508
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,686
The rest of us will go north!
Let's go!

509
00:48:44,821 --> 00:48:46,789
Disperse!

510
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:51,024
They will be found tonight.

511
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:55,829
<i>We must put them all on the cross!</i>

512
00:48:59,169 --> 00:49:02,627
Breathe a sound, traitor.

513
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:06,140
Even in betrayal,
he is glorious.

514
00:49:06,243 --> 00:49:11,044
And if it was not for our master,
I would open your throat.

515
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:24,719
- <i>Judas!</i>
- What are you doing here?
The streets are dangerous.

516
00:49:24,828 --> 00:49:29,026
Come with me quickly, lest you be discovered
as one of Joshua's followers. Come.

517
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:33,665
I hold you both accountable
for allowing this heretic...

518
00:49:33,770 --> 00:49:35,965
to slip through our fingers!

519
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:39,406
- Herod will know of this.
- We are keepers of the Torah.

520
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:43,775
We should not involve Rome
in a strictly Jewish issue.

521
00:49:43,880 --> 00:49:48,908
This carpenter has incited difficulties
ever since he came to the district.

522
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:51,510
The Romans will
make it their problem.

523
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:54,454
As if their presence in Judea
wasn't enough already.

524
00:49:54,558 --> 00:49:59,325
I have seen the centurion guards march about
this place as if it was their own backyard.

525
00:49:59,429 --> 00:50:01,795
Let's give them
no more reason.

526
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:07,495
Gentlemen, I'm not convinced this Joshua
of Nazareth is the threat he's purported to be.

527
00:50:07,604 --> 00:50:10,971
It's true, rabbi.
We've seen so many false prophets.

528
00:50:11,074 --> 00:50:15,602
What makes this man different than any man
who claims to be the Messiah?

529
00:50:15,712 --> 00:50:19,273
Surely. How many such men have
we seen in recent years?

530
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:22,784
Ten? Twenty?
What makes this carpenter...

531
00:50:22,886 --> 00:50:27,346
and his army of 12 fishermen
such a terrible threat?

532
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:30,324
You wish to see
the difference?

533
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:33,362
Go. Look outside
and see the difference!

534
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:43,337
Now's not the time, Judas.

535
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,568
- When is it ever the time?
- Where are the others?

536
00:50:46,676 --> 00:50:50,908
- Is Joshua all right?
- As best I know, yes.

537
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:54,780
He and the others escaped into the hillside
towards Gethsemane.

538
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,750
Why did you not go with them?

539
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:59,344
Joshua sent me
for supplies.

540
00:50:59,456 --> 00:51:02,619
If not for you stopping me,
I'd be at the marketplace-

541
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:07,494
Mary Magdalene,
why do you stare at me so?

542
00:51:07,597 --> 00:51:10,930
I know Joshua
loves you greatly.

543
00:51:11,034 --> 00:51:13,696
Why would he risk
sending you into town?

544
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:15,999
I told you,
he sent me for supplies.

545
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:20,008
- Where are your supplies?
- I had no time. The crowd- I feared for my life.

546
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:25,548
If you're on your way
to the temple precinct-

547
00:51:25,649 --> 00:51:28,846
Would you betray him, Judas?

548
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:36,521
My actions
would never betray him.

549
00:51:36,626 --> 00:51:40,118
- Only force his hand.
- To following your way?

550
00:51:40,230 --> 00:51:42,790
It is the only way.

551
00:51:42,899 --> 00:51:45,925
Violence is the only language
these Romans speak.

552
00:51:46,036 --> 00:51:49,233
It is foolish to think
we could drive them out of Judea...

553
00:51:49,339 --> 00:51:51,807
by spreading word ahead
and performing miracles.

554
00:51:51,908 --> 00:51:54,672
They laugh at us!

555
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:58,046
Trust me.

556
00:51:58,148 --> 00:52:01,311
They will not laugh when they feel the sting
of a thousand Jewish swords.

557
00:52:01,418 --> 00:52:05,878
And then what? They will send
a whole army to overpower you.

558
00:52:05,989 --> 00:52:08,116
Then we'll raise
a bigger army.

559
00:52:09,826 --> 00:52:13,922
His way was foretold
by the scriptures, Judas.

560
00:52:16,066 --> 00:52:18,000
Do you doubt
he's the Messiah?

561
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,197
I believe him, maybe.

562
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,501
But it is his passive ways
I find fault with.

563
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:28,009
<i>Judas, he is a man of peace.</i>

564
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:30,341
Peace won't drive out
the Romans!

565
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:36,547
His way will succeed much faster
than your army of zealots.

566
00:52:36,653 --> 00:52:40,282
You say that...

567
00:52:40,390 --> 00:52:44,656
only because it is easier to love the Messiah
than a fisherman.

568
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:50,694
What is it you see in him
that is not in me?

569
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,166
The truth.

570
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:56,603
Well, here is my truth.

571
00:53:02,245 --> 00:53:04,543
Fine.

572
00:53:04,648 --> 00:53:09,347
Would you like a feast
your master has yet to enjoy?

573
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:17,393
Yes! A feast with bread!
And power!

574
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:20,554
Absolute glory!

575
00:53:20,664 --> 00:53:22,757
Yes!

576
00:53:22,866 --> 00:53:26,427
He will come as a mighty king
arriving on horseback...

577
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:30,097
<i>leading a great army</i>
<i>of warriors!</i>

578
00:53:30,207 --> 00:53:35,975
Where is this Nazarene's army?
I see only an army of fishermen!

579
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,309
Who does this
black Nazarene think he is?

580
00:53:38,415 --> 00:53:42,476
Oh, he proclaims that he rules
over the kingdom of heaven.

581
00:53:42,586 --> 00:53:45,384
<i>A kingdom of</i>
<i>dark-skinned Jews!</i>

582
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:47,649
Well, I will be a part
of no such kingdom!

583
00:53:47,757 --> 00:53:50,453
- <i>Yes!</i>
- Nothing good ever came from Nazareth.

584
00:53:52,395 --> 00:53:54,124
Who comes?

585
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,163
<i>Go, Abaddon! Go!</i>
<i>Go tell them.</i>

586
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:02,136
Tell Caiaphas what you know
about this false prophet.

587
00:54:02,239 --> 00:54:06,107
<i>Tell him! Tell him everything!</i>
<i>Let him know!</i>

588
00:54:06,209 --> 00:54:09,178
Tell him, Abaddon.
He blasphemes.

589
00:54:31,067 --> 00:54:34,264
- Papa!
- We returned as soon as we heard.

590
00:54:34,371 --> 00:54:36,635
- Where's Mama?
- Shh! Mama is resting.

591
00:54:36,740 --> 00:54:39,174
- Come help us.
- Oh!

592
00:54:58,395 --> 00:55:01,125
What business
do you have here, woman?

593
00:55:01,231 --> 00:55:04,132
- I wish to speak to you.
- What does she want?

594
00:55:04,234 --> 00:55:06,828
Tell her to go. There is no room
for sinners here.

595
00:55:06,936 --> 00:55:08,836
- Go tend to your mother.
- But, Papa, she's-

596
00:55:08,938 --> 00:55:10,906
Now!

597
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:15,376
Speak.

598
00:55:15,478 --> 00:55:17,810
I have come in hopes
of saving the life of your son.

599
00:55:17,914 --> 00:55:21,577
- What about my son?
- Judas goes now to betray him to the Sanhedrin.

600
00:55:21,685 --> 00:55:23,676
Judas!
By my own hands, I'll-

601
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:27,848
There is no time.
We must hurry and warn the Messiah.

602
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:31,518
He and his followers have seeked refuge
in the mountains of Gethsemane.

603
00:55:31,628 --> 00:55:36,156
- How do you know this?
- I was with Judas tonight.

604
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:38,097
You did what?

605
00:55:38,201 --> 00:55:42,365
Only to delay the pig so that Joshua
would have more time to escape.

606
00:55:42,472 --> 00:55:45,839
But I cannot stand in judgment
of the profession...

607
00:55:45,942 --> 00:55:48,934
by which you've chosen to live your life,
Mary Magdalene.

608
00:55:49,045 --> 00:55:53,414
But my son did forgive your sins,
and he is greater than us all.

609
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:56,451
- Thank you.
- We must hurry.

610
00:55:56,553 --> 00:56:00,182
But I will get noticed.

611
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,690
Mary will accompany you.

612
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:41,260
My mother is hurt the most.

613
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:45,994
She understands the journey
I have taken...

614
00:56:46,102 --> 00:56:50,129
the journey that I must take...

615
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:52,140
because I love you.

616
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:55,541
I love you too, Thomas.

617
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:58,739
And my Father loves you.

618
00:56:58,848 --> 00:57:03,444
But she is a woman of old...

619
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:06,113
and I'm her youngest son.

620
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:13,358
I hope she doesn't think
I'm a disappointment.

621
00:57:15,799 --> 00:57:19,132
A disappointment, Thomas?

622
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:22,796
You have been chosen
to carry my message.

623
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:25,397
How can that be
a disappointment?

624
00:57:28,545 --> 00:57:33,312
It is my Father's message.
And when I am long gone...

625
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:38,149
<i>men will speak of us-</i>

626
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:41,781
<i>how the Son of God came</i>
<i>to fulfill a prophecy...</i>

627
00:57:41,891 --> 00:57:46,954
<i>with the help</i>
<i>of 12 chosen men.</i>

628
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:51,932
But, master,
my mother thinks...

629
00:57:52,035 --> 00:57:57,530
I've left my fishing nets behind
to take up with a false prophet-

630
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:02,907
<i>that I have given up</i>
<i>my real service.</i>

631
00:58:03,012 --> 00:58:05,242
Is that what you believe,
Thomas?

632
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:08,408
No.

633
00:58:08,518 --> 00:58:11,783
Master, I believe in you...

634
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:15,153
with every fiber that is me.

635
00:58:20,930 --> 00:58:25,833
I know you've all been under
a great deal of strain-

636
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:28,199
the running and hiding.

637
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:35,306
There are rumors that they are looking for us,
and we might be killed.

638
00:58:35,411 --> 00:58:37,971
<i>Are you afraid, Andrew?</i>

639
00:58:42,151 --> 00:58:44,051
I am.

640
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:48,283
<i>Who else among you</i>
<i>is afraid?</i>

641
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:01,728
This grain of wheat...

642
00:59:01,838 --> 00:59:06,434
if I throw it on the ground,
there it will lie and die.

643
00:59:06,543 --> 00:59:12,140
<i>But only when it dies</i>
<i>can it bear fruit.</i>

644
00:59:15,051 --> 00:59:20,216
In my death,
there will be life.

645
00:59:20,323 --> 00:59:25,920
Have you brought all of us here
to die, master?

646
00:59:26,029 --> 00:59:31,899
<i>They are looking for us,</i>
<i>but they only want me.</i>

647
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:40,169
- Master, it is not safe.
- Master, do not leave us yet. It is still early.

648
00:59:42,278 --> 00:59:45,076
I have to go speak
with my Father.

649
00:59:45,181 --> 00:59:47,649
<i>Perhaps I should</i>
<i>accompany you, master.</i>

650
00:59:47,750 --> 00:59:50,651
Tonight, much danger
lurks in the darkness.

651
00:59:50,753 --> 00:59:52,948
And we'll go as well.

652
00:59:55,692 --> 00:59:57,353
Come.

653
01:00:01,631 --> 01:00:05,658
Tell us about this Joshua,
since you speak so publicly of him.

654
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:10,267
My neighbor is a blind man
and has always been so.

655
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:14,503
This Nazarene came upon him
and laid hands on him...

656
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:17,045
and all at once,
my neighbor could see.

657
01:00:17,146 --> 01:00:19,341
- This is sacrilegious!
- He should be arrested!

658
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:22,748
There's no crime
in restoring sight to a blind man.

659
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:25,719
- It is a blessing that the man received.
- Shh! Continue.

660
01:00:25,822 --> 01:00:28,313
<i>After restoring</i>
<i>the man's sight...</i>

661
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:30,722
the Nazarene told him
of a kingdom in heaven...

662
01:00:30,827 --> 01:00:33,489
<i>where he would have</i>
<i>everlasting happiness.</i>

663
01:00:33,596 --> 01:00:36,463
See? This Nazarene speaks
nothing against the Torah.

664
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:39,729
I profess to you, Caiaphas,
this Joshua is nothing more than-

665
01:00:39,836 --> 01:00:43,033
Forgive me.
Forgive me, rabbi, but there's more.

666
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:46,404
Let him speak.
Continue.

667
01:00:46,509 --> 01:00:51,310
This Joshua from Nazareth,
this false prophet...

668
01:00:51,414 --> 01:00:54,008
said the only way to enjoy
the kingdom of heaven...

669
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:56,915
- is through him.
- Through him?

670
01:00:57,020 --> 01:01:00,751
What, he is the gatekeeper?

671
01:01:02,759 --> 01:01:07,822
- He said through him
because he is the Son of God.

672
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:12,765
- The Son of God?
- He blasphemes!

673
01:01:12,869 --> 01:01:16,828
Are you sure those were
the Nazarene's exact words, Abaddon?

674
01:01:16,939 --> 01:01:19,203
I swear on
my own life, rabbi.

675
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:25,614
<i>You see, rabbis, this is</i>
<i>what was meant by the vision...</i>

676
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:29,708
had by Isaiah in the Talmud.

677
01:01:29,819 --> 01:01:33,118
You are most insightful,
young Joshua.

678
01:01:33,222 --> 01:01:36,282
Yes. Tell us, Joshua.

679
01:01:36,392 --> 01:01:40,055
How is it that a boy of 12
could have so much knowledge?

680
01:01:40,163 --> 01:01:43,758
My knowledge of the scriptures
is granted by my Father.

681
01:01:43,866 --> 01:01:47,063
It could be said that all
knowledge is granted by God.

682
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:49,866
How is it that your knowledge
rivals the wisdom of rabbis...

683
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:52,600
who have devoted their
entire lifetimes to study?

684
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:57,779
Because I am the Son of God.

685
01:02:13,329 --> 01:02:15,297
You may speak.

686
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:17,866
<i>Rabbi...</i>

687
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:21,403
I-I know three men that this so-called king
laid hands on.

688
01:02:21,504 --> 01:02:26,999
<i>One of them, Lazarus,</i>
<i>brother to Martha and Mary of Bethany...</i>

689
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:30,170
was supposedly
brought back to life.

690
01:02:31,280 --> 01:02:33,612
I've heard the rumors.

691
01:02:33,716 --> 01:02:36,446
But there is but one
who has the power...

692
01:02:36,552 --> 01:02:40,716
to summon a cold body up from the grave
and breathe life into it.

693
01:02:40,823 --> 01:02:42,757
Satan.

694
01:02:44,727 --> 01:02:47,287
He speaks the truth.

695
01:02:47,396 --> 01:02:49,990
No godly man would awaken
a body from its grave...

696
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:53,895
after the almighty God...

697
01:02:54,003 --> 01:02:58,235
in all his wisdom,
has taken him.

698
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:02,972
It is bold, brazen.

699
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:06,014
<i>And there are more stories like this.</i>

700
01:03:09,685 --> 01:03:11,880
And what do you think now?

701
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:17,491
I thought so.

702
01:03:18,795 --> 01:03:21,423
Blasphemer!

703
01:03:21,531 --> 01:03:23,499
Clear the way!

704
01:03:30,306 --> 01:03:32,274
Here he is.

705
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:45,519
He is named Judas.

706
01:03:47,023 --> 01:03:48,024
<i>Well, we have been waiting</i>
<i>for you, Judas of Iscariot.</i>

707
01:03:48,059 --> 01:03:51,687
<i>Well, we have been waiting</i>
<i>for you, Judas of Iscariot.</i>

708
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:54,820
Have you come
to tell us their location?

709
01:03:54,931 --> 01:03:56,922
I have.

710
01:03:57,967 --> 01:04:00,094
Where are they hiding?

711
01:04:02,205 --> 01:04:04,105
In Gethsemane.

712
01:04:04,207 --> 01:04:09,008
Gethsemane? A dozen poor fishermen
hiding in Gethsemane?

713
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,873
Tell us, Judas.

714
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:18,386
<i>Gethsemane is a place of rest and relaxation</i>
<i>visited by only the wealthy.</i>

715
01:04:19,422 --> 01:04:21,447
Why would fisherman
hide there?

716
01:04:21,557 --> 01:04:24,253
Maybe he figures it's a place
where we wouldn't think to look.

717
01:04:26,796 --> 01:04:29,731
He is very clever.

718
01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:32,027
You've done very well,
Judas of Iscariot.

719
01:04:33,903 --> 01:04:39,102
The agreement was for
30 pieces of silver, correct?

720
01:05:09,805 --> 01:05:13,605
Master, are you all right?

721
01:05:15,711 --> 01:05:18,612
Just a little tired.
Weary.

722
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:20,682
Can we help, master?

723
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:23,976
When the soul is tired,
my love...

724
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:27,487
only prayer can bring about
some helpful relief.

725
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,658
Well, I can't stand this.

726
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:32,694
I can't stand it...

727
01:05:32,795 --> 01:05:35,195
watching you
go through this.

728
01:05:35,298 --> 01:05:37,892
Can't we just make our way
over the Kidron Valley?

729
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:40,903
Leave here?

730
01:05:42,972 --> 01:05:44,940
And then what?

731
01:05:48,811 --> 01:05:50,779
If only I could.

732
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:54,042
I don't want any part of it...

733
01:05:54,150 --> 01:05:57,449
sitting here like sheep...

734
01:05:57,553 --> 01:05:59,646
waiting for them
to take you away.

735
01:06:04,560 --> 01:06:07,154
Do you really love me,
Peter?

736
01:06:07,263 --> 01:06:09,891
With all my heart.

737
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:11,899
You know I do.

738
01:06:17,473 --> 01:06:19,373
Here.

739
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:25,912
You take this
while I go pray.

740
01:09:23,959 --> 01:09:26,052
Master?

741
01:09:28,030 --> 01:09:30,430
<i>What has happened to you?</i>

742
01:09:34,503 --> 01:09:36,835
Do you really care, Peter?

743
01:09:39,041 --> 01:09:40,941
I don't understand.

744
01:09:44,446 --> 01:09:48,746
I ask you to wait for me...

745
01:09:50,519 --> 01:09:53,249
to watch over me
for one hour...

746
01:09:53,355 --> 01:09:56,119
while I go speak
with my Father...

747
01:09:56,225 --> 01:09:58,853
<i>and you couldn't even</i>
<i>do that.</i>

748
01:09:58,961 --> 01:10:01,429
- We were just a little-
- Excuses.

749
01:10:01,530 --> 01:10:07,127
All I ever hear are excuses.

750
01:10:10,839 --> 01:10:13,330
Don't you think I am tired?

751
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:20,040
Don't you think I am tired?

752
01:10:22,017 --> 01:10:24,076
But you have to fight off
the sleep.

753
01:10:26,021 --> 01:10:29,388
<i>Beware of the flesh and anything</i>
<i>that is tempting.</i>

754
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:33,253
Because the flesh is weak...

755
01:10:36,699 --> 01:10:39,634
even if the spirit
is willing.

756
01:10:41,971 --> 01:10:44,064
Beware, Peter.

757
01:10:46,242 --> 01:10:48,142
Beware of temptation.

758
01:10:54,950 --> 01:10:57,680
- Wait. Somebody comes.
- It's Judas.

759
01:10:57,786 --> 01:11:00,152
- Judas!
- It's Judas.

760
01:11:03,092 --> 01:11:05,185
Well done, Judas!

761
01:11:06,762 --> 01:11:11,699
Yesterday, they cheer
a fisherman prophet who rides a donkey.

762
01:11:11,800 --> 01:11:14,200
Today, they cheer
the man who betrayed him.

763
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:17,431
Who can understand
these Jews?

764
01:11:17,539 --> 01:11:20,337
As a man, I must have
my views heard.

765
01:11:20,442 --> 01:11:24,105
This Joshua of Nazareth
is nothing but a carpenter...

766
01:11:24,213 --> 01:11:26,704
with a gift of the knowledge
of the scriptures.

767
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:29,443
Perhaps he is plagued
with a mental deficiency...

768
01:11:29,551 --> 01:11:33,317
<i>which causes him to think</i>
<i>that he is the Messiah.</i>

769
01:11:33,422 --> 01:11:35,390
Where is the harm?

770
01:11:35,491 --> 01:11:40,793
He's able to convince only his fisherman
followers and a sprinkling of others.

771
01:11:40,896 --> 01:11:42,796
A sprinkling of others?

772
01:11:42,898 --> 01:11:46,026
Rabbis, I fear that you have both
spent far too long in this temple.

773
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:48,160
The Nazarene
and his disciples-

774
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:50,170
they are known
far and wide.

775
01:11:50,272 --> 01:11:53,139
He is turning
the opinion of thousands.

776
01:11:53,242 --> 01:11:55,301
He is just one man.

777
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:59,211
You speak of him as if he is the King of Jews
he professes himself to be.

778
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:02,182
- Maybe you dispute what's written in the Torah.
- What?

779
01:12:02,284 --> 01:12:06,482
- Why, Joseph of Arimathea-
- Shush, shush, shush! Quiet!

780
01:12:06,588 --> 01:12:09,250
Rabbis,
get hold of yourselves.

781
01:12:09,358 --> 01:12:11,553
We merely sent for him.

782
01:12:11,660 --> 01:12:15,494
- We're not sentencing him.
- It's one and the same.

783
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:20,529
It is my wish.

784
01:12:20,636 --> 01:12:25,505
If I may suggest, Caiaphas, that whatever
are the opinions of us in here...

785
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:28,098
we bring him in
for his own safety.

786
01:12:30,112 --> 01:12:34,412
The crowds would kill him
if they found him first.

787
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:43,283
How much further?
I hope we're not too late.

788
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:47,328
The Romans, in their heavy armor and boots,
cannot get along these paths as easily as we can.

789
01:12:47,429 --> 01:12:51,024
They must travel a different road.
We will get to Gethsemane before they do.

790
01:12:51,133 --> 01:12:53,101
How is it that
you know of this path?

791
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:55,568
Many wealthy men
spend time in Gethsemane.

792
01:12:55,671 --> 01:12:58,936
When they desire my company,
they'd much rather be in places unseen.

793
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:01,601
Go.

794
01:13:12,688 --> 01:13:15,987
- How armed are these fishermen?
- His men have but four swords among them...

795
01:13:16,091 --> 01:13:18,082
but they will not fight.

796
01:13:18,193 --> 01:13:22,152
A group of fishermen with four swords
and no will to fight?

797
01:13:22,264 --> 01:13:24,391
I could have carried this mission out myself.

798
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:28,402
Horatius, do you remember Marias-
large man, red hair?

799
01:13:28,504 --> 01:13:31,598
- He trained us in the lance.
- Oh, yes. I remember him.

800
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:35,165
Always joked about
killing Jews with his lance.

801
01:13:35,277 --> 01:13:37,404
He washed over
in our journey here.

802
01:13:37,513 --> 01:13:40,573
A shame. He was a man
who was born to his work.

803
01:13:40,682 --> 01:13:43,549
Lucky he did not live
to see this day.

804
01:13:43,652 --> 01:13:46,678
Roman officers being sent
by Jews to capture Jews.

805
01:13:46,789 --> 01:13:49,314
What has our
Empire become?

806
01:13:49,425 --> 01:13:51,393
No.

807
01:13:52,861 --> 01:13:55,329
No.

808
01:13:55,431 --> 01:13:57,399
Having second thoughts,
Judas?

809
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,568
<i>Hmm?</i>

810
01:14:02,304 --> 01:14:05,432
<i>Always happens to traitors.</i>

811
01:14:13,148 --> 01:14:15,048
What is it, Jew?

812
01:14:17,586 --> 01:14:20,487
- <i>What is it?</i>
- I know a shorter way.

813
01:14:21,757 --> 01:14:23,725
Go.

814
01:14:47,783 --> 01:14:49,751
My time draws near.

815
01:14:51,186 --> 01:14:54,246
<i>But, master,</i>
<i>what can we do?</i>

816
01:14:59,027 --> 01:15:02,463
I will issue one last
commandment to you all.

817
01:15:03,966 --> 01:15:06,764
Anything, master.

818
01:15:06,869 --> 01:15:09,463
After I die...

819
01:15:12,574 --> 01:15:14,599
my work and message
must not die.

820
01:15:16,678 --> 01:15:18,737
<i>They will win...</i>

821
01:15:18,847 --> 01:15:23,250
only if they succeed
in silencing my message.

822
01:15:30,359 --> 01:15:32,452
But they are mistaken.

823
01:15:32,561 --> 01:15:34,859
What do you want us to do?

824
01:15:38,700 --> 01:15:42,864
<i>James, John, my sons of thunder...</i>

825
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:48,003
you will speak in my voice...

826
01:15:48,110 --> 01:15:50,874
and you will tell the others...

827
01:15:50,979 --> 01:15:53,777
that they must sell
everything of value...

828
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:57,577
<i>so that they can</i>
<i>spread my message.</i>

829
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:02,657
All of you.

830
01:16:03,892 --> 01:16:05,792
Outside Jerusalem...

831
01:16:05,894 --> 01:16:10,126
<i>towards Syria,</i>
<i>Asia...</i>

832
01:16:10,232 --> 01:16:13,633
past the Black Sea,
the Mediterranean...

833
01:16:13,735 --> 01:16:15,635
and so on.

834
01:16:17,272 --> 01:16:19,297
But how?

835
01:16:19,408 --> 01:16:22,241
There are only 12 of us.

836
01:16:22,344 --> 01:16:25,108
Twelve...

837
01:16:25,213 --> 01:16:28,580
shall become a thousand.

838
01:16:28,684 --> 01:16:31,778
<i>And a thousand,</i>
<i>10,000.</i>

839
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:36,415
<i>And a million</i>
<i>and more.</i>

840
01:16:39,861 --> 01:16:41,829
We will do this.

841
01:16:45,567 --> 01:16:50,903
Good.
My message will not die.

842
01:16:58,080 --> 01:17:00,674
Drop your weapons!

843
01:17:05,354 --> 01:17:08,517
Which of you is
Joshua of Nazareth?

844
01:17:08,624 --> 01:17:11,320
I am he.

845
01:17:15,197 --> 01:17:18,598
He lies.
I am Joshua.

846
01:17:18,700 --> 01:17:21,168
<i>You are not black enough, Jew.</i>

847
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:23,464
Arrest them all!

848
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:25,904
- Protect yourselves!
- Enough! Enough!

849
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:29,204
I will come peacefully.

850
01:17:55,337 --> 01:17:58,829
You betray me
with a kiss, Judas.

851
01:18:03,712 --> 01:18:06,180
Enough!

852
01:18:06,281 --> 01:18:10,911
The prophecy
must be fulfilled.

853
01:18:12,087 --> 01:18:14,078
I will come quietly.

854
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:16,521
- <i>Master, please.</i>
- <i>You will not go with them.</i>

855
01:18:31,006 --> 01:18:32,906
Messiah.

856
01:18:42,818 --> 01:18:45,946
Time to meet your future,
Nazarene.

857
01:18:49,257 --> 01:18:51,384
<i>Let's go.</i>

858
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:17,510
<i>Join me.</i>

859
01:20:19,781 --> 01:20:24,844
<i>Join me in paradise.</i>

860
01:21:09,030 --> 01:21:12,158
<i>Master, may I ask you a question?</i>

861
01:21:12,267 --> 01:21:14,735
<i>You may ask.</i>

862
01:21:14,836 --> 01:21:19,330
<i>How does it feel to be different?</i>

863
01:21:22,611 --> 01:21:25,739
In my Father's eyes, Thomas...

864
01:21:25,847 --> 01:21:28,008
we are all different...

865
01:21:28,116 --> 01:21:30,175
yet we are all the same.
