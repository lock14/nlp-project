1
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,827
Another punishment is waiting for her.

2
00:01:46,206 --> 00:01:47,798
Such disgrace.

3
00:01:47,874 --> 00:01:50,342
Who would have thought
when my son married her...

4
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:53,937
she would one day bring such disgrace
to his memory.

5
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:57,009
Even now she's in there,
putting on that powder.

6
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,278
God's watching her. God will punish her.

7
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:01,980
This shall not go on. I shall forbid it.

8
00:02:02,055 --> 00:02:04,216
It's gone on long enough.
Grushenka, you hear me?

9
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,780
It's gone on too long.

10
00:02:05,859 --> 00:02:08,384
Don't you worry, Mama. God will punish her.

11
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:13,165
Well, your aunt and I have discussed it.
We've decided, haven't we, Vera?

12
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,293
We're going to make her stop,
and if she won't, then we cast her out.

13
00:02:16,369 --> 00:02:17,358
Isn't that right, Vera?

14
00:02:17,437 --> 00:02:19,928
Don't think about it anymore, Mama,
and don't worry yourself.

15
00:02:20,006 --> 00:02:21,098
You'll only distress yourself.

16
00:02:21,174 --> 00:02:22,641
God will punish her for what she's doing.

17
00:02:22,709 --> 00:02:26,008
It's you who'll be punished.
Why do you talk that way about Mama?

18
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:28,309
Why do you always say
horrible things about her?

19
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:31,316
Oh, silence, child. Silence.
You don't understand these things.

20
00:02:31,384 --> 00:02:32,373
Thank God you don't.

21
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:35,888
If Mama didn't have to go out to work,
then you would have to go instead.

22
00:02:35,955 --> 00:02:37,547
Then who would be the wicked one?

23
00:02:37,624 --> 00:02:38,955
- Katya.
- Oh, silence.

24
00:02:39,025 --> 00:02:41,721
- Where do you think you're going, child?
- I want to go and play.

25
00:02:41,794 --> 00:02:44,388
No. She wants to play
with those frightful Jews downstairs.

26
00:02:44,464 --> 00:02:47,160
- That's what you want to do, child?
- Let me go.

27
00:02:48,868 --> 00:02:51,393
- Can I go downstairs, Mama?
- Yes, of course.

28
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:57,203
You shouldn't touch her
when you're going to your work.

29
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:00,577
But Katya is right, isn't she, Grusha?

30
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,305
If I didn't earn money for us,
it would be you who'd have to...

31
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:07,883
find a way.
And it wouldn't be so easy for you.

32
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:12,522
Then play something else.
You don't have to play that all the time.

33
00:03:12,592 --> 00:03:14,492
Play whatever you want.

34
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:17,460
Oh, hello. Your daughter just came down,
did you know?

35
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:18,929
I know. I hope you don't mind.

36
00:03:18,998 --> 00:03:21,466
Send her back upstairs
when you've had enough of her.

37
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,867
Would you like to stay for a moment?
Look at those rascals.

38
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:28,271
- I'll make you some tea.
- No, no, no. I must go. I'll be late.

39
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:31,242
- Thank you.
- Well, take care of yourself.

40
00:03:31,511 --> 00:03:33,274
This city can be dangerous at night.

41
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:36,110
Oh, I can take care of myself. Bye.

42
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,014
Goodbye.

43
00:03:59,472 --> 00:04:01,167
Do you speak French?

44
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:05,272
Of course you do.

45
00:04:07,347 --> 00:04:09,178
Come on, say something.

46
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:13,579
This part of town, it's so dull.

47
00:04:14,454 --> 00:04:18,686
Come to the French district.
It's much more fun.

48
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:22,092
There's more enjoyment, more laughter.

49
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,856
Come on.

50
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:36,200
Come with me. I'll pay you enough.

51
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,868
You won't regret it.

52
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:39,502
I'm expected at my work.

53
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,809
They won't miss you tonight.

54
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:44,739
I'm a rich man.

55
00:04:45,551 --> 00:04:48,748
Really?
I didn't know rich men rode the tram.

56
00:04:48,855 --> 00:04:50,584
Everyone rides the tram.

57
00:04:51,791 --> 00:04:55,249
I saw T.V. Soong himself
on the tram the other night.

58
00:04:55,328 --> 00:04:57,228
Besides, I have a limousine.

59
00:04:57,330 --> 00:04:59,730
It's waiting just here. At this next stop.

60
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,494
A chauffeur, everything.

61
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:05,463
Get off and I'll take you where you're going.

62
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,809
Come on.

63
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:36,532
Some other time...

64
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:39,127
Hey, don't go!

65
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:47,404
We have to. We have to stick together.

66
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,709
And not just because we're Russians.
That's not the only reason.

67
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:04,994
...every time you're with him it's Victor.

68
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,463
- Victor?
- Yes.

69
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:13,732
Well, hello again.

70
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:17,105
- How's your little one?
- Better, thank you. Much better now.

71
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:20,813
That one.
She went back with that German last night.

72
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,111
I knew she would.
She might as well be on the streets.

73
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:26,549
That's the third time this week.

74
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:29,217
You'll sit with me tonight, won't you?

75
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:34,756
It's a disgrace
the way some of these girls behave.

76
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:37,528
Have they no shame at all?

77
00:06:37,597 --> 00:06:40,691
Isn't it the same for all of us?
You and me, too?

78
00:06:42,135 --> 00:06:46,162
If you mean Monsieur Verdurin,
you know that was different.

79
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,666
And for you, too.

80
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:54,011
You're passionate. Love sweeps you away.

81
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:56,041
We're women, we can't help that.

82
00:06:56,115 --> 00:06:59,915
Masha, all of us here have to fall in love
from time to time.

83
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:01,880
To feed our children...

84
00:07:02,522 --> 00:07:05,184
and our mothers and our sisters.

85
00:07:07,660 --> 00:07:10,561
Please, please sit with me.

86
00:07:11,197 --> 00:07:14,655
Don't worry. I'll sit with you. It's all right.

87
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:28,678
Hey, hey, hey...

88
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:32,079
I told you to get a new dress.

89
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:35,709
Yes, I found one,
but the shop is keeping it for me.

90
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:38,757
That's what you said last week.
You look shabby.

91
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:42,056
Sorry. I'll have it tomorrow for sure.

92
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:44,662
Remember, I've warned you.

93
00:07:45,097 --> 00:07:46,086
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

94
00:07:46,165 --> 00:07:48,861
Don't you know what time it is?
Stop the chat!

95
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:50,300
Lights!

96
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:52,769
Hey. You are sitting in wrong place.

97
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:00,774
I well understand Mr. Robertson's fears.

98
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:04,010
And he is, of course,
quite right to express them.

99
00:08:04,083 --> 00:08:06,381
I might ask the same questions.

100
00:08:07,019 --> 00:08:09,010
I can only emphasize...

101
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:12,819
that the problems
concerning our consignments of tea...

102
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:14,859
are not of great relevance.

103
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:18,762
Our volume of trade in textiles
remains by far...

104
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,924
the largest in the Far East...

105
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,264
and we continue to enjoy...

106
00:08:23,336 --> 00:08:24,360
Yeah.

107
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:29,672
...the special esteem in which we
and our whole history out here are held.

108
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,111
Absolutely.

109
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:44,145
The Japanese always like to posture.

110
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:47,818
In this case, I don't feel
they really mean anything much by it.

111
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:50,328
It's just a show of strength.

112
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:53,092
What we might call samurai bravado.

113
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:57,026
Oh, Jackson, the very man.

114
00:08:57,103 --> 00:09:00,561
We were just discussing
the intentions of the Japanese.

115
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,702
Perhaps you'd care to enlighten us.

116
00:09:03,776 --> 00:09:06,336
I'm afraid I've no insights
to offer you whatsoever.

117
00:09:06,412 --> 00:09:09,904
These days I only know what my man
reads to me from the newspaper...

118
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:14,112
and I try not to have him do that any more
than is strictly necessary.

119
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:18,182
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I wish you all a pleasant evening.

120
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:20,549
- Good night.
- Good night.

121
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,220
Thank you, I'll manage. Good evening.

122
00:09:25,364 --> 00:09:27,491
- Pleased to meet...
- Pardon me.

123
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:32,301
I think it's time
for a tearful parting of the ways...

124
00:09:32,371 --> 00:09:34,601
between Mr. Jackson and the old firm.

125
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:37,336
We can hardly cast him off just yet, old man.

126
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:38,934
Not after what happened to him.

127
00:09:42,949 --> 00:09:44,211
I'm all right.

128
00:09:48,154 --> 00:09:52,215
I'd like to go to the little club, please, Liu,
and then on to Del Monte's.

129
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:55,854
The door is here.

130
00:09:57,763 --> 00:09:58,855
Thank you.

131
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:12,604
Excuse me.

132
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,544
Excuse me. Excuse me.

133
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:19,274
- Mr. Jackson.
- Thomas.

134
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,013
My, my, this is a surprise.

135
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:25,285
I didn't expect to meet you
in a place like this.

136
00:10:25,524 --> 00:10:28,049
We better keep this from your dad, eh?

137
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,856
I came to look for you, sir.

138
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:32,420
I thought you might want a little company.

139
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:35,567
Oh, that's good of you.

140
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:41,898
Mr. Jackson, what are you doing here?
A place like this.

141
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:45,177
This is a dive.

142
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:46,900
Dive?

143
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:51,281
Well, this establishment here, Thomas,
may not be perfect.

144
00:10:51,617 --> 00:10:53,448
Oh, no, it's not perfect at all.

145
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,647
In my opinion, it's a mighty impressive
little place all the same.

146
00:10:56,722 --> 00:11:00,385
Mr. Jackson, a man of your fine reputation...

147
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:04,293
This is Shanghai, Thomas.
A person can do much as he pleases.

148
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,695
- But I think you might be more comfortable...
- Thomas, my friend...

149
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:09,360
why don't you go home
and get some sleep?

150
00:11:09,602 --> 00:11:11,866
I don't like you wandering around
these parts of town.

151
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,929
I feel kind of responsible for you
on account of your dad.

152
00:11:15,007 --> 00:11:18,602
Anything happens to you here,
I feel I would have to answer to him.

153
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:22,944
Now go on home to bed.
Me, I've got a few things still to do up here.

154
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:26,309
Well, then.

155
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:30,486
- Good night, sir.
- Good night, Thomas.

156
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,321
Pardon me.

157
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:34,923
Excuse me.

158
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,265
- How are you?
- Fine. How are you?

159
00:11:43,502 --> 00:11:46,938
- Fine.
- Dragon, please.

160
00:11:47,773 --> 00:11:51,004
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

161
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:56,839
Please forgive me, sir,
but I couldn't help overhearing.

162
00:11:57,850 --> 00:12:00,944
That young man, he is your protégé?

163
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,983
No, hardly.

164
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:06,647
He, like most people, fails to see...

165
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,289
all there is to see.

166
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:14,123
Myself, I tend to agree
with your assessment.

167
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,262
This establishment is not perfect...

168
00:12:18,504 --> 00:12:23,100
but it is certainly one of the best
Shanghai has to offer at this moment.

169
00:12:42,862 --> 00:12:47,595
I believe, sir,
I've seen you around here before.

170
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,461
It's very possible.
We have nothing to match this in Japan.

171
00:12:52,872 --> 00:12:54,567
Not even in Tokyo.

172
00:12:55,274 --> 00:12:57,572
Shanghai these days is remarkable.

173
00:12:58,244 --> 00:13:01,577
It has several places
of comparable standard.

174
00:13:01,847 --> 00:13:05,476
These places you say
are of a comparable standard...

175
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:09,954
- just which ones did you have in mind?
- Not far from here, there is the Navy Bar.

176
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:13,286
- Navy Bar.
- I personally find it very interesting.

177
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:16,690
Then there is the Wha Kim
in the French Concession.

178
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:19,353
And perhaps...

179
00:13:20,432 --> 00:13:22,366
the Last Chance in Foochow road.

180
00:13:22,434 --> 00:13:25,267
Myself, I'd add the Ching Lieng to that list.

181
00:13:25,371 --> 00:13:27,134
Ching Lieng, I wonder...

182
00:13:27,206 --> 00:13:29,037
Ching Lieng isn't so much to your taste?

183
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:33,010
It is very interesting,
but in my personal opinion...

184
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:38,005
perhaps not at quite the same level as...

185
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:42,349
- well, for instance, here.
- You may be right.

186
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,319
But I like him very much.

187
00:13:56,368 --> 00:14:00,771
I'm pleased
to make your acquaintance, Mr...

188
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,369
- Matsuda.
- Matsuda.

189
00:14:03,442 --> 00:14:07,139
And you, sir.
I believe you are Mr. Todd Jackson.

190
00:14:07,646 --> 00:14:10,308
The distinguished American diplomatist.

191
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,875
Not so distinguished.

192
00:14:13,953 --> 00:14:16,854
The same Todd Jackson, I believe...

193
00:14:16,922 --> 00:14:20,221
whom the English Foreign Minister
once referred to as...

194
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:24,962
- the last hope for the League of Nations.
- That was all a few years back.

195
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:27,157
A lot's happened since then.

196
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:32,263
I have no quarrel with your countrymen
anymore, Mr. Matsuda.

197
00:14:32,905 --> 00:14:34,600
Or with anybody else.

198
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:38,804
Besides, I came in here
to get away from all of that.

199
00:14:39,245 --> 00:14:41,304
I quite agree, Mr. Jackson.

200
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:46,551
In a place like this, we should be allowed
to forget the world outside...

201
00:14:47,553 --> 00:14:49,646
and its many difficulties.

202
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:52,587
At least until the morning.

203
00:15:22,021 --> 00:15:25,787
Hey, I bet you've never been in this place.
Come on.

204
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,258
- Where?
- Here. Let me show you something.

205
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,131
The bouncers here, they're no good.

206
00:15:33,198 --> 00:15:36,497
Now listen to that.
In the bar of my dreams, Mr. Matsuda...

207
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:39,162
I'd have the best team of bouncers in town...

208
00:15:39,738 --> 00:15:40,796
and in the whole of Asia.

209
00:15:40,873 --> 00:15:43,000
They'd be hand-picked,
and they'd be well trained.

210
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:45,771
Only then can you have control. See that?

211
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:51,580
The bouncers are like your dials, you know.
You control the mood with them.

212
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,483
You can turn it this way or turn it that way.

213
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:59,252
With a good team of bouncers, a fellow, you
could conduct the place like an orchestra.

214
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:18,976
Do you know, Mr. Jackson...

215
00:16:19,044 --> 00:16:22,411
the establishment I would most
like to visit just now?

216
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,948
No. Which is that?

217
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:27,049
This bar of yours.

218
00:16:28,354 --> 00:16:30,345
This bar of your dreams.

219
00:16:30,723 --> 00:16:33,692
Well, who knows? Maybe one day you will.

220
00:16:34,793 --> 00:16:37,990
I'm not a rich man,
but I've got a little stored away.

221
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:42,297
Now, sometimes I think about it.

222
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:45,064
So you may really build this establishment?

223
00:16:45,871 --> 00:16:47,338
This bar of your dreams?

224
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,237
Right now, I don't have enough...

225
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:52,471
but, you know, in a town like this,
you can have a stroke of luck, and then...

226
00:16:52,544 --> 00:16:56,071
I think about getting up one morning
and taking every dollar I have...

227
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:59,015
and going out and putting it on a horse.

228
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:40,988
The women, of course,
you'd have to choose very carefully...

229
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,421
as carefully as the bouncers.

230
00:17:43,662 --> 00:17:47,189
You need a kind of balance
between the erotic...

231
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:49,390
and the tragic.

232
00:17:50,302 --> 00:17:54,136
Very important to choose
just the right women.

233
00:17:57,342 --> 00:18:00,243
Excuse me, but I must be going.

234
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:02,906
My driver will be waiting for me.

235
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:06,576
Mr. Jackson,
perhaps I can offer you a lift somewhere?

236
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,678
No, thank you, my own man will come
and find me before long.

237
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,781
He always does in the end,
whatever I do to try and lose him.

238
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:16,521
Then may I thank you
for an unusually enjoyable evening?

239
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:19,462
Mr. Matsuda, this has been a true pleasure.
Really.

240
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,824
- I hope we meet again.
- I hope so, too.

241
00:18:22,901 --> 00:18:24,801
- Good night.
- Good night.

242
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:00,933
Excuse me.

243
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:05,606
I believe I have the honor of greeting
Countess Sofia Alexeyevna Belinskya.

244
00:19:06,745 --> 00:19:09,873
Forgive me.
It's quite possible you won't remember me...

245
00:19:10,782 --> 00:19:12,545
but we were friends.

246
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,314
Well, that's to say,
we sometimes played tennis together...

247
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:18,049
at the Skopichenkos' house in Petersburg.

248
00:19:18,924 --> 00:19:20,892
Of course, I was small then.

249
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:24,759
- I'm sure you won't remember me, but...
- No, of course.

250
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:28,791
How could I forget
Count llya Vladimirovitch Litvanoff?

251
00:19:30,202 --> 00:19:32,067
You always beat me.

252
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:35,232
I'm truly flattered you should remember.

253
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:38,807
How nice to see you again.

254
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:47,213
I'm sorry. I must return to my work.

255
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:52,451
Me, too. It was very good of you
to come over like this.

256
00:19:52,524 --> 00:19:54,617
Well, I just happened to see you.

257
00:19:57,095 --> 00:19:58,995
Please, excuse me.

258
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,048
Thank you very much.

259
00:20:28,193 --> 00:20:29,182
Three.

260
00:22:03,588 --> 00:22:06,853
Here, take my arm. Leave with me.

261
00:22:07,225 --> 00:22:09,955
Miss, if your intention
was to be kind to a blind man...

262
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,861
well, I thank you,
but I can get along just fine.

263
00:22:12,931 --> 00:22:15,399
If you were proposing something
altogether different...

264
00:22:15,467 --> 00:22:19,233
well, I have to tell you that kind of thing
doesn't interest me so much just now.

265
00:22:19,304 --> 00:22:21,898
I wasn't proposing anything like that.

266
00:22:22,474 --> 00:22:24,442
But if you leave here alone...

267
00:22:24,843 --> 00:22:28,074
there are two villains over there
who will follow you...

268
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,172
hit you over head with their little...

269
00:22:31,783 --> 00:22:33,751
blackjack and then...

270
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,712
steal your wallet
and perhaps your shoes, too.

271
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:43,284
You shouldn't wear such fine shoes
when you come around here.

272
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:47,723
You really suppose I'm in danger?

273
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,432
I know it,
but if you leave with me you'll be safe.

274
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:57,804
They'll think you're my client, and
they don't dare interfere with such things.

275
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,874
Why...

276
00:23:01,913 --> 00:23:05,280
Don't worry. You'll be safe...

277
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:08,143
from them and from me.

278
00:23:09,988 --> 00:23:11,114
Okay.

279
00:23:20,198 --> 00:23:21,756
I should wear shabbier shoes, you say?

280
00:23:21,833 --> 00:23:24,961
Much shabbier,
and try and look like you have friends...

281
00:23:25,303 --> 00:23:26,930
dangerous friends.

282
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:32,409
Well, thanks for your advice.
I'm beholden to you.

283
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:34,411
You Russian?

284
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:36,102
Yes.

285
00:23:37,649 --> 00:23:41,210
I was listening just now when you were
talking with your friend, and I...

286
00:23:41,286 --> 00:23:43,914
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't be eavesdropping on people.

287
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:47,152
You know, it's just that
since I lost the use of these eyes...

288
00:23:47,225 --> 00:23:49,318
- I can't...
- No, no, it's all right.

289
00:23:49,861 --> 00:23:50,987
That's all right.

290
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:54,156
I know that times are hard for you people.

291
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:58,565
You've been thrown out of your country,
and no one willing to take you in.

292
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:02,735
I just want you to know
that I understand why you...

293
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:09,376
- We carry on.
- He's found me, always does.

294
00:24:10,081 --> 00:24:13,448
Well, tonight you got me out of trouble.
I thank you for that.

295
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:16,152
I've always tended
to get a little overconfident.

296
00:24:16,221 --> 00:24:18,951
I need someone to check on me
from time to time.

297
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:22,016
- You have someone like that?
- I don't know.

298
00:24:22,694 --> 00:24:25,993
I guess one time my wife
used to perform that function.

299
00:24:26,698 --> 00:24:29,462
Nowadays I just have my man Liu over there.

300
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:31,764
He's a clever fellow,
but I guess it's not his business...

301
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:34,169
to stop me making a fool of myself.

302
00:24:34,639 --> 00:24:36,834
Tonight, though, you helped me out.

303
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,639
- Thank you.
- A pleasure.

304
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,780
- Good night.
- Good night.

305
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:59,228
- You said you'd be out here at 11:30.
- Who cares what I said?

306
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:02,095
- Now it's 12:17.
- What are you? A railway service?

307
00:25:02,501 --> 00:25:04,469
- You said 11:30.
- Do you see her?

308
00:25:04,536 --> 00:25:06,026
You see her? The one I was talking to?

309
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:08,095
The Countess?
The one I was talking with just now?

310
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,471
- She's still there.
- She's still there?

311
00:25:10,775 --> 00:25:12,242
She's the one.

312
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:17,144
Liu Chi, she's the one,
the one I've been looking for.

313
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:18,811
Yes, yes.

314
00:27:35,086 --> 00:27:37,213
Child, come back here. Do you hear me?

315
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,619
Mama.

316
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,181
- Katiushka.
- Child, come back here, please.

317
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,517
Come here, child.

318
00:27:42,594 --> 00:27:44,585
Mama, can I please come with you
to the market?

319
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:49,032
Yes, of course you can, my darling, but keep
your voice down, Uncle Peter's sleeping.

320
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:51,864
He's not sleeping. He's just pretending.

321
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,971
- When are we going?
- I have to sleep first. I'm very tired.

322
00:27:56,141 --> 00:27:59,577
Mama, I want to go and see the boats
before they're all gone.

323
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,839
All right, but I need to sleep first.

324
00:28:01,913 --> 00:28:03,744
Katya, come here, please.

325
00:28:08,953 --> 00:28:11,854
I told you to stay here. Did you hear me?

326
00:28:12,957 --> 00:28:14,549
Your bed is free.

327
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,240
It was a good night's work.

328
00:28:56,434 --> 00:29:00,165
Dear Sofia Alexeyevna, you sleep on this.

329
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:05,132
So soft.

330
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:43,072
But you promised me. You promised me.

331
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:45,309
And I kept my promise.
I kept the dress for you.

332
00:29:45,383 --> 00:29:46,975
Many people wanted it. Do you understand?

333
00:29:47,051 --> 00:29:48,678
I kept it for you. Now you pay $5.

334
00:29:48,753 --> 00:29:50,812
But you promised me I could have it for $3.

335
00:29:50,889 --> 00:29:52,789
- I didn't promise you that, madam.
- I need it for my work.

336
00:29:52,857 --> 00:29:53,949
Many people want this dress.

337
00:29:54,025 --> 00:29:56,516
I have to come here every single day.

338
00:29:56,594 --> 00:29:58,994
- I come in the morning at 4:30.
- And this is why I need this.

339
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:02,032
- And I go back at night, at 11:30 at night.
- And you told me yesterday...

340
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,534
I have to work very hard to feed my children.

341
00:30:04,936 --> 00:30:08,599
You have the dress. It is beautiful.
It is very, very nice color.

342
00:30:14,479 --> 00:30:17,004
- Are you going on the boat?
- Sure.

343
00:30:18,449 --> 00:30:21,316
- Where will you go?
- Up to Soochow.

344
00:30:21,386 --> 00:30:24,253
- You should go.
- We're going soon.

345
00:30:25,623 --> 00:30:26,954
So long.

346
00:30:28,426 --> 00:30:29,825
May I look?

347
00:30:29,894 --> 00:30:31,555
Go ahead.

348
00:31:35,126 --> 00:31:36,115
Katya.

349
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:39,119
Come, darling. It's time to go.

350
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,198
Mama, you got the dress!

351
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:43,926
I got it.

352
00:32:08,126 --> 00:32:09,286
Here you go.

353
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:16,500
You know which one's gonna win?

354
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:18,831
Most definitely. I'm betting...

355
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:20,961
I think you're right.

356
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:31,741
You know, sir,
I was thinking of having a little flutter.

357
00:32:31,816 --> 00:32:33,147
Good, good.

358
00:32:33,217 --> 00:32:36,311
I'm glad to see a little recklessness
entering your spirit, Thomas.

359
00:32:36,387 --> 00:32:38,685
This city is starting to work on you at last.

360
00:32:38,756 --> 00:32:40,314
I'm glad to see you so cheerful.

361
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:43,087
As a matter of fact,
I was getting kind of anxious...

362
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:45,527
because, you see, I've come here to...

363
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:48,524
I've come here to have a little flutter myself.

364
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:51,193
Are you thinking of placing a large bet?

365
00:32:51,269 --> 00:32:54,204
Substantial enough. Thank you, Jimmy.

366
00:32:54,706 --> 00:32:57,869
You know, Thomas,
there comes a day when you say there are...

367
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:00,103
some things that you want to do in life...

368
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:02,476
and you'll never do them
unless you take a risk.

369
00:33:02,547 --> 00:33:06,916
Hold everything that you have in your hand
and just take a risk.

370
00:33:07,151 --> 00:33:10,518
Sir, are you intending to place
a very large bet?

371
00:33:11,189 --> 00:33:14,283
There are some in this city
who would not consider it large...

372
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:17,851
but it's just about everything that I have.

373
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,023
But I think that...

374
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:24,500
No, we're not in Vermont, Thomas.
Don't cluck around me like an old hen.

375
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:27,197
Mr. Jackson? Mr. Jackson?

376
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:30,573
I'm Fu Chuan Fang. We met in Nanking.

377
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:33,035
A League of Nations conference.

378
00:33:33,277 --> 00:33:35,142
I was sorry to hear about your misfortune.

379
00:33:35,213 --> 00:33:37,738
Thank you.
This is my friend, Thomas Crane.

380
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,384
How do you do, Mr. Crane?

381
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:46,048
Gentlemen, may I introduce
General Shen Yinchu...

382
00:33:46,491 --> 00:33:48,152
and General Ji Deng?

383
00:33:48,226 --> 00:33:50,251
Ni men hao, gentlemen?

384
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:55,425
Although it's many years too late, let me
thank you from the bottom of my heart

385
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,937
for your dedication in finding
a just solution to our nation's problems.

386
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:04,839
Mr. Jackson has been a true friend

387
00:34:04,909 --> 00:34:06,501
to all Chinese people.

388
00:34:07,745 --> 00:34:11,010
A just solution to your nation's problems.

389
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,945
And where has it got us?

390
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:17,485
All that clever meddling
we diplomats got up to back then...

391
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,952
and now your nation in chaos...

392
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,957
and Japanese occupying the north...

393
00:34:23,327 --> 00:34:25,420
and your people in civil war.

394
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:29,964
Excuse me, gentlemen.

395
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:32,059
I must go and place a bet.

396
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:44,840
Mr. Jackson.

397
00:35:46,577 --> 00:35:48,101
Good afternoon, Mr. Jackson.

398
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:50,807
- Mr... Mr...
- Matsuda.

399
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:53,077
Exactly. Good to see you again, sir.

400
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,382
And I'm particularly pleased
to run into you, Mr. Jackson.

401
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,982
Because I am leaving Shanghai tomorrow.

402
00:35:59,056 --> 00:36:01,616
This gives me a chance to say goodbye.

403
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:03,887
Even though our acquaintance was brief...

404
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,361
I very much enjoyed our discussion
the other night.

405
00:36:06,430 --> 00:36:07,454
So did I.

406
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:11,298
- Well, it's a pity you're leaving.
- I hope to be back in a year or so.

407
00:36:11,369 --> 00:36:14,429
Perhaps we will have a chance
to continue our research then.

408
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:19,204
In fact, Mr. Matsuda, I had hope that
if you return to Shanghai in a year's time...

409
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:23,043
we can go one better
than just continuing our research.

410
00:36:24,115 --> 00:36:27,414
Today, you see, I've had a little luck and...

411
00:36:30,555 --> 00:36:31,681
My God!

412
00:36:34,225 --> 00:36:38,093
- I've had a great deal of luck.
- I see, Mr. Jackson.

413
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:40,528
Mr. Matsuda,
I don't mind telling you right now...

414
00:36:40,598 --> 00:36:43,192
that I feel more than a little frightened.

415
00:36:43,734 --> 00:36:45,258
Let me say this to you today...

416
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:48,737
that if you return to Shanghai
one year from now...

417
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:53,232
you will be a most welcome guest
in my own establishment.

418
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:55,211
The bar of your dreams.

419
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:58,479
So I may have the pleasure, after all.

420
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:02,219
The bar of my dreams.

421
00:38:35,713 --> 00:38:38,307
You're a very nice man,
but you know the rules.

422
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:39,974
You're breaking my heart.

423
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:42,212
Please, you need to get a ticket.

424
00:38:42,286 --> 00:38:45,119
Next time you come.
Next time come and ask for me.

425
00:38:45,356 --> 00:38:46,914
- Oh, hello.
- Excuse me.

426
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:48,288
You remember me?

427
00:38:48,359 --> 00:38:51,658
You looked out for me the other night,
and I very much appreciated it.

428
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:55,495
You're most welcome.
I see you took advice about shoes.

429
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:57,932
Shoes? Oh, no, I hadn't intended to.

430
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:01,961
I just think things have got a little
worse for wear without my noticing.

431
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:08,674
So shall we dance?

432
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:13,281
Well, frankly, I was wondering
if you might just sit and talk...

433
00:39:13,617 --> 00:39:16,279
- for as long as the dance.
- Oh, certainly.

434
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:19,085
Shall we go here?

435
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:25,853
Excuse me one moment here.

436
00:39:31,302 --> 00:39:32,428
I...

437
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:39,767
- Is this okay for you?
- This is good, nice here.

438
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:42,771
Good. Well, look...

439
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:48,876
I have a proposal to make.

440
00:39:51,355 --> 00:39:54,153
Oh. I see.

441
00:39:54,425 --> 00:39:57,986
Oh, no, no, no.
Not that kind of proposal. No.

442
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,663
It's just that, well...

443
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:04,462
I'm intending to open an establishment.

444
00:40:04,535 --> 00:40:07,595
It's something that I've been planning
for some time...

445
00:40:09,006 --> 00:40:10,871
and it wouldn't work without you.

446
00:40:10,941 --> 00:40:14,468
It wouldn't work without me?
Whatever do you mean?

447
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,142
The place that I'm going to open...

448
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:21,446
it'll be a bar, you know,
a little dancing and a little music and...

449
00:40:22,319 --> 00:40:25,755
But it won't be like this.
It'll be nothing like this.

450
00:40:26,690 --> 00:40:30,319
My place will be
just the way that I've seen it...

451
00:40:30,895 --> 00:40:33,363
up here, inside...

452
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:39,862
and I need you to be my centerpiece.

453
00:40:41,705 --> 00:40:44,640
And I would do what for you, exactly?

454
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:48,877
Just be there and, I think,
dance with a few customers...

455
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:54,348
and talk with them and host them.
That's strictly all that I'd ask.

456
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,247
I'll see that you're well remunerated for it...

457
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:02,452
and you wouldn't have to earn money
in any other way.

458
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:06,296
You realize, don't you...

459
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:10,699
I'm not the only Russian Countess
in Shanghai reduced to this sort of life.

460
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:12,463
I know that, I know.

461
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:14,837
But it's you.

462
00:41:17,541 --> 00:41:19,099
You're perfect.

463
00:41:19,977 --> 00:41:21,945
And you're what I need.

464
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:26,774
I'm perfect?

465
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:30,710
But how can you know what I'm like?

466
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:33,479
Well, we met the other night.

467
00:41:35,593 --> 00:41:38,391
You take it from me,
I know what I'm looking for.

468
00:41:44,535 --> 00:41:47,299
- Will you consider it?
- Consider it?

469
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:54,601
I'd accept happily
if I'm really so perfect for you...

470
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,710
but you can't even see me.

471
00:41:58,782 --> 00:42:02,775
You should at least
try to feel what I look like.

472
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,321
Blind people do that, don't they?

473
00:42:09,894 --> 00:42:14,024
No, no, no, no.
There's no need. There's no need.

474
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,065
I know exactly what you're like.

475
00:42:18,402 --> 00:42:19,596
You...

476
00:42:20,971 --> 00:42:22,302
the bar...

477
00:42:22,673 --> 00:42:23,697
everything.

478
00:42:23,774 --> 00:42:25,241
It's all up here...

479
00:42:26,076 --> 00:42:27,407
inside.

480
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:34,578
But instead,
maybe we could have that dance.

481
00:42:34,852 --> 00:42:37,013
You can dance all right?

482
00:42:37,087 --> 00:42:39,749
Well, to be frank,
I've not tried it since I've lost my sight.

483
00:42:39,823 --> 00:42:42,917
But I think that with you helping me,
I'll be all right.

484
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:46,457
So let's dance.

485
00:43:11,956 --> 00:43:13,947
- Excuse me.
- Sorry.

486
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:21,026
- Sorry.
- What are you doing?

487
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,623
- Excuse me?
- Dance with a blind man?

488
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:25,692
You try and stop us.

489
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,205
Blind men have very good ears.

490
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:33,038
You can't dance here.

491
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:35,272
Even if you speak Chinese.

492
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:37,773
You will disturb the other guests.

493
00:43:38,582 --> 00:43:41,346
If you have any objections, kindly go to hell.

494
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:43,180
You tell him.

495
00:43:43,487 --> 00:43:47,856
- Okay, let's find these people in here.
- I don't need to worry about him anymore.

496
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:24,826
Thibaut de Passavant,
he's here in Shanghai.

497
00:44:24,895 --> 00:44:27,523
Sister Anastasia told me yesterday
after church.

498
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:30,965
Thibaut de Passavant?
What a charming man.

499
00:44:31,802 --> 00:44:33,133
Beautiful man.

500
00:44:33,270 --> 00:44:36,899
- You certain he's here in Shanghai?
- Sister Anastasia was quite sure.

501
00:44:36,974 --> 00:44:40,933
He arrived at least four months ago.
He's posted to the French Consulate.

502
00:44:41,111 --> 00:44:44,080
I wish we could see him,
but he can't come here.

503
00:44:44,148 --> 00:44:48,312
Olga, dear, I've been thinking about this.
Things are so different.

504
00:44:48,385 --> 00:44:50,785
Perhaps we should pay a call on Thibaut.

505
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:55,586
No, dear. No, no. I don't think so, no.

506
00:44:55,659 --> 00:44:58,389
It would be for him to call on us.
That's the correct way.

507
00:44:58,462 --> 00:44:59,827
Yes, yes, of course...

508
00:44:59,897 --> 00:45:02,764
but it is all so different these days.

509
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:07,065
- So perhaps we could call on him instead.
- No, dear, no. That's not correct.

510
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:10,504
We can't call on him first,
and he can never call on us here.

511
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:14,804
- Peter, dear, what is your opinion?
- Dear, no. We can't see him.

512
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,368
That's an end to it.

513
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:19,878
Please don't distress yourself, Aunt Vera.

514
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:24,216
Once we get to Hong Kong,
our friends will visit us again...

515
00:45:24,288 --> 00:45:28,918
you'll give recitals, there'll be card parties,
everything as it used to be.

516
00:45:32,796 --> 00:45:34,491
What's the matter?

517
00:45:36,333 --> 00:45:37,823
The Oblomovs.

518
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:40,735
When they were here,
they were having to live just like us.

519
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:43,034
Now look at them,
living the life they used to live.

520
00:45:43,107 --> 00:45:44,938
How do you know that?

521
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:47,536
They wrote to us.

522
00:45:48,445 --> 00:45:50,572
Anna Nicoleyava wrote to us.

523
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:52,878
You read her letter.

524
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,613
Do you want me to read it to you again?

525
00:45:58,188 --> 00:46:01,453
Mama, where's Anna's letter?
Where did you put it?

526
00:46:06,463 --> 00:46:11,093
She took the trouble to write to us
just to tell a pack of lies.

527
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:22,335
Don't you worry, Aunt Vera.

528
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:25,438
Once we get to Hong Kong,
things will be the way they should be.

529
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:27,609
What a relief that will be.

530
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:31,414
To be rid of the shame
that's been brought on our family.

531
00:46:31,488 --> 00:46:35,424
It's a mercy my son didn't live to see this.

532
00:46:43,433 --> 00:46:45,025
Are you all right?

533
00:46:45,102 --> 00:46:47,900
Yes, I'm fine. I just need a little air.

534
00:46:48,005 --> 00:46:49,768
Is Katya all right?

535
00:46:50,207 --> 00:46:52,141
She's enjoying herself.

536
00:46:54,578 --> 00:46:55,704
Here.

537
00:46:56,180 --> 00:46:57,442
Sit down.

538
00:46:57,881 --> 00:46:59,075
Relax.

539
00:47:01,785 --> 00:47:05,084
Please excuse me.
I have to finish these jackets by 5:00.

540
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,713
Yes, of course.

541
00:47:26,143 --> 00:47:27,633
Right, it's open.

542
00:47:53,971 --> 00:47:55,404
Mr. Matsuda.

543
00:48:22,132 --> 00:48:23,463
The bartender.

544
00:48:23,533 --> 00:48:27,799
I first came across him last summer
in a place off the Avenue Joffre.

545
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,335
And as for the strongarm boys,
the bouncers...

546
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:34,275
well, I spent a long time hand-picking them.

547
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:36,574
Different boys that I had seen
in different places.

548
00:48:36,647 --> 00:48:41,016
I'd always kept them in mind,
the ones that I knew I'd one day want to use.

549
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,848
I think that outright violence...

550
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:46,481
will destroy a perfectly blended mood
in seconds.

551
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:50,652
But a vague and ever-present
possibility of violence...

552
00:48:50,727 --> 00:48:53,525
that's something else,
and that can be effective.

553
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,622
With a good strongarm team
you could do it.

554
00:48:55,699 --> 00:48:57,189
I was always convinced of that.

555
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:01,135
You bring in the rougher elements,
but then you keep them under control.

556
00:49:01,204 --> 00:49:05,573
The other important ingredient is,
well, what do you call it?

557
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,138
Sexuality?

558
00:49:08,211 --> 00:49:11,408
The vague promise
of an intimate encounter?

559
00:49:15,385 --> 00:49:17,444
You have to judge it finely, though.

560
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:19,887
You have to choose women with real care.

561
00:49:39,109 --> 00:49:41,168
So that lady...

562
00:49:41,411 --> 00:49:43,038
she's a Russian?

563
00:49:43,113 --> 00:49:46,708
Perhaps an aristocratic lady
who chose to give up her homeland?

564
00:49:46,783 --> 00:49:47,841
Chose?

565
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:48,942
No.

566
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:52,147
- That is why you named this establishment.
- Yeah, you got it.

567
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:56,886
She is the Countess Sofia
Alexeyevna Belinskya.

568
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:00,092
She has everything that I wanted
for this place.

569
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:05,100
She has the allure,
the tragedy, the weariness.

570
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:10,366
She knows that history has no place...

571
00:50:10,440 --> 00:50:12,465
for her kind anymore.

572
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:16,736
She's perfect.

573
00:50:17,047 --> 00:50:18,639
My centerpiece.

574
00:50:19,149 --> 00:50:21,743
You must be a happy man, Mr. Jackson.

575
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:26,820
In a little over a year,
you've managed to realize your dream.

576
00:50:27,090 --> 00:50:28,955
I thought for a while that I had...

577
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:31,893
that I had really achieved
what I'd always wanted...

578
00:50:31,962 --> 00:50:34,123
but I was never quite happy.

579
00:50:34,464 --> 00:50:36,955
For a long time,
I couldn't put my finger on it.

580
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:40,902
I just knew, I just knew that something...
There was something missing.

581
00:50:40,971 --> 00:50:44,429
And just a few days ago,
I realized what it was.

582
00:50:46,510 --> 00:50:50,537
There's no political tension in here.

583
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:57,843
You are saying
that without this political dimension...

584
00:50:57,921 --> 00:51:01,220
- your establishment...
- No, it'll never be more than a confection.

585
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:03,623
Just a pretty confection, you know.

586
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:05,126
A few Chinese Reds.

587
00:51:05,195 --> 00:51:09,154
Some of their Nationalist enemies
and maybe a few of your countrymen.

588
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,790
Maybe some of mine.

589
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:13,597
I can see it. I can see it all in here.

590
00:51:14,838 --> 00:51:17,671
But right now, I just can't see a way forward.

591
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:21,268
How do you get such people in here
all at the same time?

592
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:25,638
I mean, a fellow can't just take a gun
and force them to come in.

593
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,540
Mr. Jackson, please be careful.

594
00:52:26,877 --> 00:52:28,469
- No, no, no. Stop.
- All right.

595
00:52:28,545 --> 00:52:30,775
How often do I have to tell you
I can get around fine?

596
00:52:30,847 --> 00:52:33,509
Yes, but not this morning.
The men have moved everything.

597
00:52:33,583 --> 00:52:35,710
- It's all different.
- Good, well, you've warned me.

598
00:52:35,785 --> 00:52:38,253
Now sit down and carry on playing.

599
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:41,654
I just need something to sit on.

600
00:52:43,326 --> 00:52:44,691
Watch out.

601
00:52:56,406 --> 00:52:57,896
That woke me.

602
00:52:58,542 --> 00:53:01,568
I'm sorry, I didn't know you were still here.

603
00:53:02,679 --> 00:53:05,375
Why are you sleeping here again anyway?

604
00:53:06,082 --> 00:53:08,414
You have a nice house to go to.

605
00:53:08,485 --> 00:53:10,248
And you slept in your clothes again.

606
00:53:10,320 --> 00:53:13,414
And what about you?
Why aren't you at home in your bed?

607
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:17,483
There's no bed for me till morning,
and my daughter...

608
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:24,560
Sorry, I was forgetting our agreement.

609
00:53:25,068 --> 00:53:27,593
I've told you, there's no agreement.

610
00:53:27,671 --> 00:53:29,935
I just said once
I thought that we'd get on best...

611
00:53:30,006 --> 00:53:33,339
if we confined our friendship
to within these walls.

612
00:53:33,743 --> 00:53:36,906
And I'd say
that's worked out pretty well so far.

613
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:39,505
And for you to hear about my life
beyond this place...

614
00:53:39,583 --> 00:53:42,313
I suppose it spoils your picture of me...

615
00:53:42,819 --> 00:53:45,344
that perfect one you have inside your head.

616
00:53:45,655 --> 00:53:48,021
I don't know what's gotten into you
this morning.

617
00:53:48,091 --> 00:53:52,050
Playing the piano first thing,
and now all this talk.

618
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:53,925
I'm sorry. I didn't know you were upstairs.

619
00:53:53,997 --> 00:53:56,898
Forget it.
Anyway, it's a nice way to be woken up.

620
00:53:56,967 --> 00:53:59,060
What you were playing, it sounded pretty.

621
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:02,798
You know, I've known you a whole year,
and I had no idea you played so well.

622
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:05,932
My Aunt Vera taught me.

623
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:09,302
She was wonderful pianist.

624
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:11,780
I've forgotten so much.

625
00:54:13,550 --> 00:54:17,281
Our friends used to send their children
to her for lessons.

626
00:54:19,356 --> 00:54:22,382
I don't even know
if she could still play now.

627
00:54:24,527 --> 00:54:27,257
She hasn't touched a piano for years.

628
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:32,367
I'm sorry. I should go.

629
00:54:32,502 --> 00:54:35,471
My bed will be ready now,
and I need to sleep.

630
00:54:35,839 --> 00:54:37,830
Well, then, till tonight.

631
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:44,903
I've known you for a whole year, and I still
don't know how you lost your sight.

632
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:48,683
I had an accident several years ago.

633
00:54:48,752 --> 00:54:52,313
But as you see, I don't let it
inconvenience me too much.

634
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:54,589
What sort of accident?

635
00:54:55,458 --> 00:54:58,586
Well, now that would be going against
our agreement.

636
00:55:09,172 --> 00:55:13,268
Why do you have such heavy doors?
You think they'll keep out the world?

637
00:55:13,343 --> 00:55:15,368
Well, that's my intention.

638
00:55:17,814 --> 00:55:19,611
I'll see you tonight.

639
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:50,507
It's my intention.

640
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:11,964
Let me out!

641
00:56:12,602 --> 00:56:14,297
Where's my family?

642
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:22,304
My family is in there.

643
00:56:28,818 --> 00:56:30,615
Three years already.

644
00:56:30,987 --> 00:56:34,150
In some ways it seems much longer.

645
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:38,523
Daddy, can I ask you something?

646
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:41,661
A promise?

647
00:57:06,956 --> 00:57:08,446
As for the...

648
00:57:08,958 --> 00:57:11,290
...give you the privilege
of taking it away, sir.

649
00:57:11,361 --> 00:57:12,919
Lovely scarf...

650
00:57:13,563 --> 00:57:15,258
Lovely coat...

651
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:17,495
120 pounds.

652
00:57:18,968 --> 00:57:20,765
It's a lovely price.

653
00:57:20,837 --> 00:57:22,896
Are you sure it would sell?

654
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:25,202
Tell me about your English teacher.

655
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:28,540
He was from England.
He was not as strict as Mrs. Henderson.

656
00:57:28,611 --> 00:57:31,045
And you should work more on your reading.

657
00:57:31,114 --> 00:57:32,604
Mary, what do you think?

658
00:57:32,682 --> 00:57:34,206
And then she wouldn't be so cross with you.

659
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:37,151
I'd be locked up
if I told you what I was thinking.

660
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:43,620
Hello?

661
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:47,329
Hello? How do you do?

662
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,225
Katya.

663
00:57:49,666 --> 00:57:51,224
Come on, Katya.

664
00:57:52,635 --> 00:57:54,193
Katya, come on.

665
00:57:55,538 --> 00:57:58,803
- That was him, wasn't it?
- Come on, Katya, we'll be late.

666
00:57:58,875 --> 00:58:00,365
The blind man.

667
00:58:00,443 --> 00:58:03,435
- That was our blind man, wasn't it?
- Yes.

668
00:58:03,713 --> 00:58:05,237
Come on, Katya.

669
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:08,408
Why didn't he speak to us?

670
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:11,281
He just didn't.

671
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:14,015
You said he was a nice man.

672
00:58:14,491 --> 00:58:16,152
He is a nice man.

673
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:19,225
Then why didn't he speak to us?

674
00:58:19,562 --> 00:58:22,395
Come on, Katya. Mrs. Henderson's waiting.

675
00:58:23,733 --> 00:58:24,927
Katya!

676
00:58:25,768 --> 00:58:26,757
Katya!

677
00:58:27,403 --> 00:58:28,392
Katya!

678
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:32,901
Hello?

679
00:58:32,976 --> 00:58:36,605
And he looked at me again and said,
"Oh dear, oh dear, oh dear."

680
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,704
He said,
"You don't half look bad, you don't."

681
00:58:38,781 --> 00:58:40,772
I said, "Who do?"
He said, "You don't." I said, "I do?"

682
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,977
He said, "Yes, you do, you don't."

683
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:45,448
Katya!

684
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:49,691
Well, young lady. How are you?

685
00:58:49,759 --> 00:58:51,056
Katya.

686
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:54,759
Mama says you are
sometimes bad-tempered.

687
00:58:55,431 --> 00:58:56,523
Why...

688
00:58:57,166 --> 00:59:00,294
I suppose she might be right.

689
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:04,340
Is that why you don't speak to us just now?

690
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:07,999
I guess it wasn't very good-mannered of me.
I'm sorry.

691
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:11,309
Mrs. Henderson is teaching me
to read and write English.

692
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,578
- One day I'll write you a letter.
- Write me a letter?

693
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:18,585
Can't be the only reason
you're learning English, can it?

694
00:59:18,655 --> 00:59:21,021
But I must write you a letter.
It's very important.

695
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:23,957
Why is it so important
that you write to me, my dear?

696
00:59:24,027 --> 00:59:26,757
Because you must take us on a boat trip.

697
00:59:26,829 --> 00:59:28,262
- Boat trip?
- Up the river.

698
00:59:28,331 --> 00:59:30,231
- To Soochow.
- Katya, that's enough.

699
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:32,200
A boat trip to Soochow?

700
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:35,394
Will you take us?
Me and Mama and Aunt Vera?

701
00:59:36,105 --> 00:59:37,663
Come, we must go.

702
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:40,538
- Goodbye, blind man.
- I'll see you later.

703
00:59:43,112 --> 00:59:44,807
Can I ask you something?

704
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:46,542
- Sure.
- A promise.

705
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:49,207
Well, depends what it is.

706
00:59:49,686 --> 00:59:52,348
When I'm grown, and I'm married...

707
00:59:53,222 --> 00:59:55,486
and I have children of my own...

708
00:59:56,426 --> 00:59:58,587
promise you'll stay with us.

709
00:59:59,062 --> 01:00:01,656
Promise you'll live with me forever.

710
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:05,165
Don't you think your husband
will have something to say about this?

711
01:00:05,234 --> 01:00:06,258
No.

712
01:00:06,636 --> 01:00:08,399
Please promise me.

713
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,705
All right.

714
01:00:13,443 --> 01:00:14,842
If that's what you want.

715
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:16,571
He said, "Which ain't?" I said, "That ain't."

716
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:19,672
He said, "That ain't?"
I said, "Yes, it is, it ain't."

717
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:22,677
I said, "But be careful when you try her,
she's a flyer...

718
01:00:22,752 --> 01:00:26,313
"if you buy her, you've a bargain.
You can take the tip from me."

719
01:00:26,522 --> 01:00:28,752
He said, "What makes you say so?"
I said, "Say so, I should say so."

720
01:00:32,428 --> 01:00:36,057
You know, Olga, dear,
I do wonder if we are making a mistake.

721
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,497
About what?

722
01:00:38,001 --> 01:00:39,798
You know about what.

723
01:00:40,336 --> 01:00:42,065
Thibaut de Passavant.

724
01:00:46,175 --> 01:00:49,576
- After all, he is an ambassador now.
- No, just a consul, dear.

725
01:00:51,547 --> 01:00:54,243
Peter, dearest, what is your view?

726
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:57,851
Should we not pay a little visit
to the French Embassy?

727
01:00:57,920 --> 01:00:59,547
It's a consulate.

728
01:01:00,823 --> 01:01:02,984
It's only a consulate, dear.

729
01:01:05,194 --> 01:01:10,131
Olga, dear, there are large beans,
and there are small beans.

730
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:13,098
In my view, a bean is still a bean...

731
01:01:13,436 --> 01:01:14,630
Sofia.

732
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:16,899
Will you deal the hand, please, now?

733
01:01:17,206 --> 01:01:19,106
I need to speak to you.

734
01:01:24,547 --> 01:01:28,813
Last night, while you were out,
I found Katya playing with your rouge.

735
01:01:29,752 --> 01:01:31,777
She put some on her face.

736
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:35,823
So? Children have to play.

737
01:01:35,892 --> 01:01:37,325
Your rouge.

738
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:40,259
Aren't you horrified?

739
01:01:40,763 --> 01:01:44,096
We've talked about this before.
You have to be more strict.

740
01:01:44,167 --> 01:01:48,536
In the evening, when you are dressed
like that, you're not to let Katya near you.

741
01:01:49,772 --> 01:01:54,209
- But how can I? She's my daughter.
- Don't you see where this is leading?

742
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:56,503
Do I have to spell it out?

743
01:01:56,946 --> 01:02:00,404
If you love her,
you'll know what I'm saying is right.

744
01:02:01,751 --> 01:02:03,378
What do you say?

745
01:02:05,321 --> 01:02:07,221
I suppose you're right.

746
01:02:07,290 --> 01:02:09,554
Then you have to do your part.

747
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:13,089
She's not to come near you
when you're like that.

748
01:02:20,536 --> 01:02:23,528
Grusha, I'll do as you say.
You're right, I see it.

749
01:02:23,606 --> 01:02:26,370
But you must promise me something.

750
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:31,035
If something happens to me,
will you love her?

751
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:34,844
I mean, treat her gently and kindly
at all times?

752
01:02:35,518 --> 01:02:37,713
You swear to me now you will. Swear it.

753
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:39,482
Of course I will.

754
01:02:40,156 --> 01:02:43,592
She's my brother's child.
She looks like him. His eyes...

755
01:02:43,659 --> 01:02:46,890
Swear you'll love her and be gentle to her.

756
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,029
I swear it.

757
01:02:50,833 --> 01:02:52,164
Thank you.

758
01:02:58,174 --> 01:03:00,005
Thank you, Grushenka.

759
01:03:05,214 --> 01:03:06,340
Papa!

760
01:03:06,549 --> 01:03:08,449
You're late.

761
01:03:08,518 --> 01:03:10,577
No, my darlings, this isn't so late.

762
01:03:30,773 --> 01:03:33,139
Very good. Show it to your mama.

763
01:03:37,213 --> 01:03:38,703
Mama? Mama?

764
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:41,614
Let me in!

765
01:03:41,684 --> 01:03:43,049
Come here, Katya.

766
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:45,917
Let me in! I've made you a new painting.

767
01:03:46,722 --> 01:03:49,054
- Why have you locked it?
- Katya.

768
01:03:49,425 --> 01:03:50,790
Come here.

769
01:03:51,093 --> 01:03:52,492
She's busy.

770
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:54,228
Let me see.

771
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:57,263
It's beautiful. Is it a soldier?

772
01:03:57,934 --> 01:04:00,596
Is this one of our dear Czar's guards?

773
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:03,471
What a funny uniform he's wearing.

774
01:04:08,711 --> 01:04:10,008
Come on.

775
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:27,895
You want me?

776
01:04:29,265 --> 01:04:30,926
- No, no.
- Come back.

777
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,744
Well, you're very quiet tonight.

778
01:04:45,648 --> 01:04:50,585
I was just wondering if,
when I'm too old to be here like this...

779
01:04:50,653 --> 01:04:53,850
if my daughter will be here instead,
in my place.

780
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:56,989
I was just thinking, that's all.

781
01:04:57,093 --> 01:05:01,086
- Well, I'm sure that she...
- But you don't want to hear this kind of talk.

782
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:03,290
We have our agreement after all...

783
01:05:03,366 --> 01:05:06,233
and I'm sorry about what happened
at the cafe this afternoon...

784
01:05:06,302 --> 01:05:09,863
disturbing you like that
when you're enjoying your radio.

785
01:05:10,973 --> 01:05:14,841
You and your daughter,
do you walk that way often?

786
01:05:16,045 --> 01:05:18,138
- Through Frenchtown?
- Yes.

787
01:05:18,948 --> 01:05:20,939
I sit in that cafe a lot.

788
01:05:21,217 --> 01:05:23,879
Not always outside like that but I...

789
01:05:25,421 --> 01:05:27,048
I'm there a lot.

790
01:05:27,723 --> 01:05:28,849
Fine.

791
01:08:09,418 --> 01:08:10,885
Mr. Jackson?

792
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:13,281
Please excuse me.

793
01:08:13,355 --> 01:08:15,789
But I was told I might find you here.

794
01:08:15,858 --> 01:08:20,090
Mr. Matsuda, won't you join me for coffee?

795
01:08:20,162 --> 01:08:23,290
No, thank you. But if you'll excuse me...

796
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:26,766
I shall impose myself on you
for just a moment.

797
01:08:26,836 --> 01:08:28,565
Please, come and sit down.

798
01:08:33,309 --> 01:08:34,776
Mr. Jackson.

799
01:08:36,212 --> 01:08:39,181
I've been thinking about your establishment.

800
01:08:39,281 --> 01:08:41,909
What you said that evening
I visited you there.

801
01:08:41,984 --> 01:08:45,442
- About it missing...
- Political tension, you called it.

802
01:08:46,388 --> 01:08:49,755
How to bring political tension
to your establishment?

803
01:08:50,726 --> 01:08:54,093
The idea struck me at the time
as a little eccentric.

804
01:08:54,563 --> 01:08:57,088
But it has intrigued me ever since.

805
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,694
I believe there is a way.

806
01:09:01,437 --> 01:09:03,837
And what is that, Mr. Matsuda?

807
01:09:04,406 --> 01:09:07,102
I'm in touch with a certain person...

808
01:09:07,343 --> 01:09:12,280
a Chinese gentleman who exercises
a degree of influence in Shanghai.

809
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:16,082
It is possible he might be able to assist.

810
01:09:16,418 --> 01:09:19,080
How exactly would he do that?

811
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:21,749
My acquaintance is in a position...

812
01:09:23,459 --> 01:09:26,553
to persuade many people
to do what he requests.

813
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:29,922
You mean that he's a hood?

814
01:09:30,065 --> 01:09:31,726
You might say so.

815
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:39,405
And he can persuade the various factions
that I want to come into my place?

816
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:41,599
Simply an idea.

817
01:09:42,344 --> 01:09:45,575
Why would he want to help me?

818
01:09:45,881 --> 01:09:47,473
Why? Because...

819
01:09:48,551 --> 01:09:53,511
Because I, in turn,
have the means to persuade him.

820
01:09:56,025 --> 01:10:00,621
What kind of work is it that you do,
Mr. Matsuda?

821
01:10:00,696 --> 01:10:03,927
Please, I would very much like to help you.

822
01:10:04,099 --> 01:10:08,798
Particularly now that I can see
what you might achieve.

823
01:10:09,872 --> 01:10:12,238
It could be something quite wonderful.

824
01:10:13,309 --> 01:10:17,245
I would suggest
you introduce first some communists.

825
01:10:17,346 --> 01:10:21,248
Not, of course, known members of the Party.
This would be too much.

826
01:10:21,350 --> 01:10:23,841
I can suggest certain people to you.

827
01:10:23,919 --> 01:10:26,114
Magazine editors, writers...

828
01:10:26,388 --> 01:10:29,789
men suspected of communist links.

829
01:10:30,059 --> 01:10:34,758
Then, after some time, when
our Red friends are comfortably installed...

830
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:40,368
you could then introduce certain individuals
associated with the Kuomintang.

831
01:10:40,803 --> 01:10:45,069
Please give these two camps plenty of time
to get used to each other.

832
01:10:45,374 --> 01:10:49,003
And only then you might add
some Chinese soldiers...

833
01:10:49,245 --> 01:10:51,713
a few Japanese merchant sailors...

834
01:10:51,947 --> 01:10:54,677
perhaps one or two Japanese businessmen.

835
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:56,718
But please be cautious.

836
01:10:56,785 --> 01:11:00,516
This will be
a most difficult balance to achieve.

837
01:11:31,787 --> 01:11:35,655
This room, these people,
they are your orchestra.

838
01:11:35,724 --> 01:11:38,056
I wouldn't have succeeded
without your assistance.

839
01:11:38,127 --> 01:11:39,788
No, I did nothing.

840
01:11:39,928 --> 01:11:41,953
- Your help was everything.
- No.

841
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:44,363
I'll always be beholden to you.

842
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:47,869
This is a wonderful achievement,
Mr. Jackson.

843
01:11:48,537 --> 01:11:51,506
- But I wonder if this will be enough.
- Enough?

844
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:54,575
I wondered if before long
you would wish to return...

845
01:11:54,643 --> 01:11:58,409
- to a broader canvas?
- Broader canvas?

846
01:11:59,515 --> 01:12:03,110
There's no broader canvas out there,
Mr. Matsuda.

847
01:12:10,392 --> 01:12:13,361
I was told you were present at Versailles...

848
01:12:13,595 --> 01:12:17,087
- at the time of the great treaty.
- That's right, I was.

849
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:20,430
I was very young, I was very junior,
but I was there, yes.

850
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:23,835
I, too, was just starting my career
at that time.

851
01:12:24,606 --> 01:12:27,939
I dreamt of being allowed to go
with our delegation.

852
01:12:28,243 --> 01:12:30,768
As a secretary, a servant, anything.

853
01:12:31,413 --> 01:12:32,971
I dreamt of it.

854
01:12:34,316 --> 01:12:36,511
Of course, I was not able to.

855
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:39,381
But even now I think about Versailles.

856
01:12:40,255 --> 01:12:42,849
After the horrors of that terrible war...

857
01:12:42,925 --> 01:12:46,622
the greatest leaders
from the greatest countries of the world...

858
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:48,356
gathered together...

859
01:12:48,664 --> 01:12:52,395
laying down the foundations
of our future civilization.

860
01:12:53,068 --> 01:12:56,765
How fortunate you were, Mr. Jackson,
to have been there.

861
01:12:56,839 --> 01:12:58,830
That's all behind me now.

862
01:13:00,476 --> 01:13:04,412
Out there, what there is,
Mr. Matsuda, is chaos.

863
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:09,907
Mistrust, deceit, hatred,
viciousness and chaos.

864
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:13,077
There's no broader canvas out there.

865
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:17,619
Nothing a man can go
and compose a pretty picture on.

866
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:24,956
What you have achieved here,
inside these walls...

867
01:13:25,033 --> 01:13:27,263
is certainly very satisfying.

868
01:13:29,738 --> 01:13:33,606
But for myself,
I still dream of a broader canvas.

869
01:13:33,709 --> 01:13:37,873
Just what is it you wish to paint
on this canvas of yours, Mr. Matsuda?

870
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:40,244
I'm not myself a great painter.

871
01:13:40,716 --> 01:13:43,446
I hope only to play a very humble part.

872
01:13:43,685 --> 01:13:46,449
But it is my wish...

873
01:13:47,055 --> 01:13:48,613
my cherished dream...

874
01:13:48,690 --> 01:13:52,148
to see Japan become a truly great nation...

875
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:56,590
as great as Britain or France...

876
01:13:56,665 --> 01:13:58,792
or your nation, Mr. Jackson.

877
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:16,745
But such things needn't concern us here.

878
01:14:17,386 --> 01:14:20,378
It is a great pleasure for me, Mr. Jackson...

879
01:14:20,522 --> 01:14:24,959
to be able to come and relax
in this wonderful atmosphere...

880
01:14:25,527 --> 01:14:29,088
forget about my responsibilities.

881
01:15:03,265 --> 01:15:06,393
I've looked everywhere for it. I can't find it.

882
01:15:08,036 --> 01:15:10,027
I'm sure Olga's lost it.

883
01:15:10,873 --> 01:15:13,637
What is it? Aunt Vera, what's wrong?

884
01:15:13,976 --> 01:15:15,238
The hat.

885
01:15:16,245 --> 01:15:19,578
Baroness Santachiara gave it
to your mama in Paris.

886
01:15:19,848 --> 01:15:21,816
I'm sure she's lost it.

887
01:15:21,950 --> 01:15:24,748
Grushenka, dear, do you know where it is?

888
01:15:25,254 --> 01:15:27,484
I'm sure Mama hasn't lost it.

889
01:15:28,223 --> 01:15:32,557
But what do you want a thing like that for?
An old hat like that?

890
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:36,125
If she hasn't lost it, that's what I'll wear.

891
01:15:36,198 --> 01:15:38,496
What do you mean? Wear it where?

892
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:41,763
I'll wear it to the French Consulate.
I'll wear it tomorrow.

893
01:15:41,837 --> 01:15:45,238
Aunt Vera,
we are not going to the Consulate.

894
01:15:45,307 --> 01:15:49,107
Peter and I will go to the Consulate.
We'll go tomorrow.

895
01:15:49,244 --> 01:15:53,237
- Darling, you have to understand...
- Grushenka, you can't stop us.

896
01:15:53,415 --> 01:15:57,681
And your mama will not stop us.
Peter and I have decided.

897
01:15:57,753 --> 01:16:00,449
Aunt Vera, everything is different now.

898
01:16:00,556 --> 01:16:03,320
They will laugh at you. And in that hat.

899
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:06,518
I will not hide myself away any longer.

900
01:16:06,595 --> 01:16:11,589
I may be poor. I am the
Princess Vera Artalinovna Belinskya.

901
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:13,862
I will go to the Consulate...

902
01:16:14,002 --> 01:16:17,267
and we will pay our respects
to our old family friend...

903
01:16:17,372 --> 01:16:19,670
Monsieur le Comte de Passavant.

904
01:16:39,328 --> 01:16:41,455
Peter, take another look.

905
01:16:41,530 --> 01:16:43,054
Look. Right there.

906
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:10,984
Peter.

907
01:17:46,561 --> 01:17:48,028
Excuse me.

908
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:49,688
But aren't you...

909
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:54,535
Yes, I knew it.
The Prince and Princess Belinksy.

910
01:17:57,039 --> 01:18:00,008
How extraordinary.
I passed you as you came in.

911
01:18:00,075 --> 01:18:02,475
I thought it couldn't be you, but it is!

912
01:18:04,046 --> 01:18:05,513
It's Antoine.

913
01:18:06,548 --> 01:18:08,072
Young Antoine.

914
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:10,211
Antoine Jacquier.

915
01:18:10,819 --> 01:18:12,446
Antoine Jacquier?

916
01:18:14,956 --> 01:18:16,287
Young Antoine.

917
01:18:17,893 --> 01:18:19,884
Can it really be you?

918
01:18:19,961 --> 01:18:21,519
My dear Princess!

919
01:18:23,365 --> 01:18:26,732
My dear Prince!
How delightful to see you again!

920
01:18:26,835 --> 01:18:28,700
But what are you doing here?

921
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:31,603
We've come to pay our respects
to M. De Passavant.

922
01:18:32,607 --> 01:18:35,576
But what a surprise
to find you here in Shanghai.

923
01:18:35,644 --> 01:18:38,204
Do you remember coming to see me

924
01:18:38,280 --> 01:18:39,907
every Tuesday and Thursday?

925
01:18:39,981 --> 01:18:42,074
Have you continued playing the piano?

926
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:46,416
Regrettably, I'm rather out of practice.
You'd be cross with me, Princess.

927
01:18:46,488 --> 01:18:49,719
You used to scold me when I didn't practice!

928
01:18:49,891 --> 01:18:51,358
I haven't forgotten.

929
01:18:51,493 --> 01:18:53,791
You were only ten years old.

930
01:18:54,129 --> 01:18:55,391
Antoine.

931
01:18:56,164 --> 01:18:57,426
I knew it was him.

932
01:18:57,499 --> 01:19:01,902
You were both so kind, so generous to me.

933
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:04,061
I think of you often...

934
01:19:04,139 --> 01:19:07,472
that marvelous house, your family.

935
01:19:09,277 --> 01:19:10,767
But now you...

936
01:19:11,446 --> 01:19:12,674
You are here.

937
01:19:46,414 --> 01:19:47,779
Grushenka!

938
01:20:03,365 --> 01:20:06,994
Vera and Peter met an old friend of theirs
today at the French Consulate.

939
01:20:07,068 --> 01:20:10,469
It was quite by chance,
but he's promised to help us.

940
01:20:11,039 --> 01:20:14,531
It seems to be absolutely true.
I have his letter here.

941
01:20:17,512 --> 01:20:18,638
He'll help us?

942
01:20:18,713 --> 01:20:20,806
He says he can arrange everything.

943
01:20:20,882 --> 01:20:24,079
Passports, papers,
tickets on a ship to Hong Kong...

944
01:20:24,152 --> 01:20:26,985
even letters of introduction. Everything.

945
01:20:28,456 --> 01:20:31,448
Of course, such things cost money.

946
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:37,229
None of it is for Monsieur Jacquier himself,
he emphasizes that.

947
01:20:37,299 --> 01:20:39,324
He's listed all the costs.

948
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:51,406
Sofia.

949
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:54,073
We might not have another chance.

950
01:20:58,587 --> 01:21:00,487
For a long time now...

951
01:21:01,656 --> 01:21:05,114
- ever since I had this job, I haven't had to...
- Katya.

952
01:21:06,127 --> 01:21:07,685
Think of Katya.

953
01:21:08,230 --> 01:21:10,391
It might be her last chance.

954
01:21:16,238 --> 01:21:20,937
- I can't promise, but I'll do what I can.
- People are afraid of the Japanese.

955
01:21:21,610 --> 01:21:25,068
By next week,
the situation might be out of his hands.

956
01:21:28,650 --> 01:21:30,413
I'll do what I can.

957
01:22:33,148 --> 01:22:34,445
Watch it!

958
01:23:05,647 --> 01:23:07,342
Mr. Jackson? Sir?

959
01:23:08,049 --> 01:23:09,812
Well, well, Thomas.

960
01:23:10,118 --> 01:23:12,018
Haven't seen you for a while.

961
01:23:12,454 --> 01:23:13,512
Where have you been?

962
01:23:13,588 --> 01:23:16,318
Well, sir, a lot of us have been saying
the same thing about you.

963
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:18,586
We don't see much of you these days.

964
01:23:18,893 --> 01:23:19,917
No?

965
01:23:23,565 --> 01:23:26,329
Mr. Jackson,
I did want to have a word with you.

966
01:23:27,168 --> 01:23:28,294
Yeah?

967
01:23:28,536 --> 01:23:29,594
Now?

968
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:33,471
Frankly, sir, the company directors
have been expressing concern...

969
01:23:33,541 --> 01:23:35,771
for some time now about...

970
01:23:37,112 --> 01:23:41,071
well, about your way of life.
You've probably been aware of this.

971
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:42,707
My way of life?

972
01:23:43,051 --> 01:23:44,484
What's that?

973
01:23:45,620 --> 01:23:47,383
You mean all this?

974
01:23:48,957 --> 01:23:50,322
I guess so.

975
01:23:53,895 --> 01:23:56,693
You don't see any of this, do you, Thomas?

976
01:23:57,332 --> 01:24:01,325
I mean, you look at this
and you see nothing.

977
01:24:04,739 --> 01:24:05,967
Nothing.

978
01:24:14,416 --> 01:24:18,079
Mr. Jackson, there was a meeting
of the board this afternoon.

979
01:24:18,153 --> 01:24:20,747
Certain people feel your association
with the company...

980
01:24:20,822 --> 01:24:23,154
is no longer necessarily...

981
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:34,593
Of course, there's the matter
of that Japanese fellow.

982
01:24:35,537 --> 01:24:38,028
- Mr. Matsuda?
- Matsuda, yes.

983
01:24:39,040 --> 01:24:40,507
I don't understand you, Crane.

984
01:24:40,575 --> 01:24:44,739
As far as I was aware,
the United States and Japan are still allies.

985
01:24:46,147 --> 01:24:49,913
But as you must know, sir,
Mr. Matsuda isn't any Japanese.

986
01:24:49,984 --> 01:24:51,611
What do you mean?

987
01:24:51,986 --> 01:24:53,613
You didn't know?

988
01:24:55,123 --> 01:24:58,854
My dealings with him
are entirely at the personal level.

989
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:04,330
Mr. Matsuda is a man...

990
01:25:04,399 --> 01:25:08,028
who is much feared and loathed
by the Chinese authorities.

991
01:25:08,536 --> 01:25:11,266
In Northern China
they remember him well enough.

992
01:25:11,473 --> 01:25:15,773
Whenever he showed up,
a Japanese invasion wouldn't be far behind.

993
01:25:16,044 --> 01:25:19,411
So as you can see, sir,
your friend's presence here in Shanghai...

994
01:25:19,481 --> 01:25:22,177
isn't exactly regarded as a good omen.

995
01:25:22,617 --> 01:25:25,643
Even the Japanese here
don't like to be seen with him.

996
01:25:35,196 --> 01:25:38,723
Mr. Matsuda and I,
we share certain interests...

997
01:25:39,901 --> 01:25:42,301
passions. We've become friends.

998
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:46,638
That's nothing to do with politics
or armies or fighting.

999
01:25:46,875 --> 01:25:49,343
That all belongs out there.

1000
01:25:50,578 --> 01:25:54,981
And as for the rest of it, your meetings,
your dinners, your receptions...

1001
01:25:55,583 --> 01:25:58,609
hell, I never intended to be a businessman.

1002
01:25:58,686 --> 01:26:01,416
They wanted to use my name
to make an extra dollar.

1003
01:26:01,489 --> 01:26:02,751
So I let them. That's all.

1004
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:05,816
If things have changed, well,
then to hell with them.

1005
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:09,463
So, sir, do I take it you don't intend to...

1006
01:26:09,531 --> 01:26:12,830
Damn right, I don't intend to.
I don't intend anything!

1007
01:26:12,901 --> 01:26:16,268
Thomas, look around you.
Don't you see all this?

1008
01:26:20,542 --> 01:26:21,804
All this?

1009
01:26:23,378 --> 01:26:26,643
You don't... You don't see...

1010
01:26:27,849 --> 01:26:29,248
the beauty?

1011
01:26:31,152 --> 01:26:35,111
Mr. Jackson, before I came out here,
I'd heard a lot about you.

1012
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:41,192
I came out here hoping to learn from you.

1013
01:26:43,131 --> 01:26:45,429
I believe you're trying to tell me...

1014
01:26:46,401 --> 01:26:50,804
Are you trying to tell me that I'm something
of a disappointment to you?

1015
01:26:53,074 --> 01:26:54,541
Frankly, sir...

1016
01:26:55,476 --> 01:26:59,378
I can't believe you're the same man
my father respects so much.

1017
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:03,844
Good night, sir.

1018
01:27:19,300 --> 01:27:22,030
So this is where you hide yourself
these days.

1019
01:27:23,805 --> 01:27:25,363
You remember me?

1020
01:27:25,440 --> 01:27:27,533
I used to see you on the tram.

1021
01:27:27,609 --> 01:27:30,305
I thought you only went
to the French Quarter.

1022
01:27:30,378 --> 01:27:33,006
I go wherever there's laughter
and happiness.

1023
01:27:33,081 --> 01:27:35,641
Wherever there are
charming beautiful ladies.

1024
01:27:36,217 --> 01:27:37,741
And I must say, my dear

1025
01:27:37,819 --> 01:27:40,083
you're particularly charming tonight.

1026
01:27:40,588 --> 01:27:42,283
Thank you.

1027
01:27:42,357 --> 01:27:43,346
Well, then.

1028
01:27:43,424 --> 01:27:46,518
What do you suppose our
little orchestra will play next?

1029
01:27:46,594 --> 01:27:50,792
If it's something slow,
then I insist you dance with me.

1030
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:52,923
But only if it's slow.

1031
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:55,765
With some women, one should only dance...

1032
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:56,861
slowly.

1033
01:27:56,938 --> 01:27:59,304
And you, my dear, are one of them.

1034
01:27:59,374 --> 01:28:03,003
Who the hell do you think you're talking to?
Who let you in here?

1035
01:28:03,077 --> 01:28:05,637
- I'm sorry, I said something wrong?
- You think I can't hear?

1036
01:28:05,713 --> 01:28:07,738
I can hear every damn word
you're saying to her.

1037
01:28:07,815 --> 01:28:09,612
In that case, you must know I said nothing...

1038
01:28:09,684 --> 01:28:14,053
What do you take her for? Dance with her?
You're not fit to breathe the air around her.

1039
01:28:14,122 --> 01:28:16,317
Get out of here! Get out!

1040
01:28:16,391 --> 01:28:20,122
Get out! Who let you in here?
I don't want you in here!

1041
01:28:20,194 --> 01:28:22,594
Get out of here!

1042
01:28:23,064 --> 01:28:25,225
Get out! Get out of here!

1043
01:28:30,805 --> 01:28:32,136
That man...

1044
01:28:59,667 --> 01:29:00,793
Here.

1045
01:29:14,615 --> 01:29:16,276
I'll leave you alone.

1046
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:18,649
But you stay up here and sleep.

1047
01:29:21,723 --> 01:29:24,590
I don't think you've been sleeping enough.

1048
01:30:10,705 --> 01:30:12,070
How is he now?

1049
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:13,801
Let him rest.

1050
01:30:33,094 --> 01:30:35,927
- Feeling better?
- Oh, yes. Yes, I am.

1051
01:30:38,132 --> 01:30:39,224
Here.

1052
01:30:40,568 --> 01:30:42,331
I'm grateful to you.

1053
01:30:43,604 --> 01:30:47,631
I rather let myself down,
and I let all of us down.

1054
01:30:51,712 --> 01:30:54,010
You've been different lately...

1055
01:30:54,982 --> 01:30:58,008
- not yourself.
- I guess that's right.

1056
01:30:58,085 --> 01:31:01,646
As it happens, I've noticed
that you haven't been yourself, either...

1057
01:31:01,722 --> 01:31:03,690
these last few evenings.

1058
01:31:06,260 --> 01:31:09,320
- Is your daughter well?
- Yes.

1059
01:31:10,832 --> 01:31:12,800
Yes, she's fine.

1060
01:31:18,306 --> 01:31:21,798
I've been thinking lately
maybe my relatives are right that...

1061
01:31:23,544 --> 01:31:25,409
I've done what I had to do for Katya.

1062
01:31:25,480 --> 01:31:29,416
But now perhaps I am harming her...

1063
01:31:30,051 --> 01:31:31,712
just by being near her.

1064
01:31:31,786 --> 01:31:34,482
You shouldn't be thinking these things.

1065
01:31:35,256 --> 01:31:37,417
But she copies me...

1066
01:31:38,526 --> 01:31:40,756
and I don't want her to have...

1067
01:31:41,963 --> 01:31:43,487
a sad life.

1068
01:31:43,564 --> 01:31:47,261
You shouldn't be having these thoughts,
not even for a minute.

1069
01:31:47,335 --> 01:31:49,633
You belong with each other.

1070
01:31:51,873 --> 01:31:53,534
I had a daughter.

1071
01:31:56,344 --> 01:31:57,902
I lost her.

1072
01:31:59,013 --> 01:32:00,878
You asked me once...

1073
01:32:00,948 --> 01:32:03,348
a while back, how I lost my sight.

1074
01:32:03,985 --> 01:32:05,384
Yes.

1075
01:32:05,453 --> 01:32:06,818
Do you want to know?

1076
01:32:06,888 --> 01:32:09,186
Yes. I'd like to know.

1077
01:32:10,658 --> 01:32:13,149
My daughter, Christina...

1078
01:32:13,728 --> 01:32:18,495
she was around the age your Katya is
right now. No, maybe she was a little older.

1079
01:32:20,568 --> 01:32:22,365
I made her a promise once.

1080
01:32:23,571 --> 01:32:26,369
I made her a promise, and it was foolish...

1081
01:32:28,376 --> 01:32:30,173
because I wasn't able to keep it.

1082
01:32:30,244 --> 01:32:32,678
When I'm grown, and I'm married...

1083
01:32:32,747 --> 01:32:36,114
- and I have children of my own.
- Yes?

1084
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:38,242
Promise you'll stay with me.

1085
01:32:39,086 --> 01:32:41,611
Promise you'll live with me forever.

1086
01:32:55,436 --> 01:32:56,664
Christina...

1087
01:33:02,176 --> 01:33:03,336
Christina.

1088
01:33:08,249 --> 01:33:11,047
It was instantaneous.
That's what you're saying?

1089
01:33:11,218 --> 01:33:13,015
She wouldn't have suffered.

1090
01:33:14,956 --> 01:33:16,446
I was afraid.

1091
01:33:17,792 --> 01:33:19,726
See, I was afraid...

1092
01:33:20,695 --> 01:33:24,426
that she might have had a little time
while she was lying there.

1093
01:33:27,501 --> 01:33:29,230
Time to realize...

1094
01:33:29,637 --> 01:33:31,605
that I'd let her down...

1095
01:33:31,672 --> 01:33:33,071
once again.

1096
01:33:33,975 --> 01:33:35,704
Oh, but she didn't.

1097
01:33:42,750 --> 01:33:45,810
You know, I was thinking.
I'd like to meet Katya again.

1098
01:33:46,721 --> 01:33:48,689
Maybe this time, we can meet properly.

1099
01:33:48,756 --> 01:33:50,815
I was thinking, perhaps if you wanted...

1100
01:33:50,891 --> 01:33:55,590
the three of us, we might go to
the public gardens one Sunday afternoon...

1101
01:33:56,631 --> 01:33:59,225
and we can listen to the brass band.

1102
01:33:59,300 --> 01:34:02,792
Do you think that Katya might like that?

1103
01:34:02,937 --> 01:34:06,839
Yes, I think she would.

1104
01:34:08,576 --> 01:34:10,476
And I would, too.

1105
01:34:18,019 --> 01:34:19,543
When you used to be a dilpomat...

1106
01:34:19,620 --> 01:34:23,215
Diplomat. Dip-lo-mat.

1107
01:34:23,524 --> 01:34:26,049
Sometimes, people will say "diplomatist."

1108
01:34:26,127 --> 01:34:28,652
Were you always a diplomat?
When you were young?

1109
01:34:28,729 --> 01:34:33,132
No. Before that,
I worked for the U.S. State Department.

1110
01:34:33,734 --> 01:34:36,828
What that means is
I worked for the American President.

1111
01:34:36,904 --> 01:34:41,739
And then I came out here to China,
because I wanted to be a diplomat.

1112
01:34:42,243 --> 01:34:45,337
When you were a diplomat,
did you go on boat trips?

1113
01:34:45,413 --> 01:34:46,903
- Boat trips?
- Now, Katya...

1114
01:34:46,981 --> 01:34:49,711
On boats that go to Soochow
and places like that.

1115
01:34:49,784 --> 01:34:52,514
- Did you ever go?
- Well, yes, we did go.

1116
01:34:53,287 --> 01:34:56,450
We did go a few times, in fact,
and it was good.

1117
01:34:56,957 --> 01:34:59,187
We had a good time in Soochow.

1118
01:35:01,062 --> 01:35:05,294
Will you take us soon?
Me and Mama. Aunt Vera, too.

1119
01:35:05,366 --> 01:35:06,799
You don't have to take the others.

1120
01:35:06,867 --> 01:35:08,960
Katya, stop annoying Mr. Jackson like that.

1121
01:35:09,036 --> 01:35:11,129
- I'm not annoying him.
- No, no, she's not annoying me.

1122
01:35:11,205 --> 01:35:12,900
Well, let's see...

1123
01:35:13,374 --> 01:35:16,309
maybe one day we'll do just that.

1124
01:35:16,377 --> 01:35:17,742
A boat trip.

1125
01:35:18,646 --> 01:35:22,980
- Well, why not? It's very pleasant upriver.
- Will you take us?

1126
01:35:23,317 --> 01:35:25,751
Well, maybe your mother and I
can talk it over.

1127
01:35:25,820 --> 01:35:27,310
A boat trip!

1128
01:35:27,988 --> 01:35:30,752
Well, I'm not promising anything.

1129
01:35:54,348 --> 01:35:57,647
The other evening,
you asked me what was on my mind.

1130
01:35:58,619 --> 01:36:01,588
- You wanted me to tell you.
- Yes.

1131
01:36:02,990 --> 01:36:04,252
I need to...

1132
01:36:06,427 --> 01:36:09,419
find $300. Very soon.

1133
01:36:11,499 --> 01:36:16,368
That's what was on my mind,
along with all usual things.

1134
01:36:22,109 --> 01:36:24,737
How do you intend to raise it?

1135
01:36:28,916 --> 01:36:31,316
I'll earn it, somehow.

1136
01:36:33,521 --> 01:36:36,615
- It's for something important?
- Yes.

1137
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:42,586
Well, I guess
you're not going to tell me what.

1138
01:36:48,702 --> 01:36:50,863
You wouldn't like to hear about it.

1139
01:37:13,894 --> 01:37:15,759
Mr. Feinstein!

1140
01:37:17,198 --> 01:37:19,962
Katya. My sweetheart.

1141
01:37:21,035 --> 01:37:22,662
How are you?

1142
01:37:24,705 --> 01:37:27,697
- Samuel?
- Countess Sofia, good afternoon.

1143
01:37:27,775 --> 01:37:32,576
This is my employer,
my friend and employer, Mr. Jackson.

1144
01:37:32,646 --> 01:37:35,672
This is our neighbor, Mr. Samuel Feinstein.

1145
01:37:36,116 --> 01:37:38,516
Very good to meet you, Mr. Jackson.

1146
01:37:38,586 --> 01:37:40,679
I've heard a lot about you from Katya here.

1147
01:37:40,754 --> 01:37:42,688
Really? How do you do, sir?

1148
01:37:43,224 --> 01:37:46,990
If you'll excuse me for a moment,
I'll just go and see to the store.

1149
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:51,498
How's that, Katya?
Will you lead the way, my friend?

1150
01:37:51,565 --> 01:37:52,862
Thank you.

1151
01:37:54,335 --> 01:37:56,701
Jew! Dirty Jewish scum!

1152
01:37:57,137 --> 01:38:01,369
It hasn't been a good day.
Not a good day at all. A lot of arguments.

1153
01:38:01,809 --> 01:38:04,277
I'm so glad the Countess
has found a good employer.

1154
01:38:04,345 --> 01:38:06,643
Do you have to put up
with a lot of that around here?

1155
01:38:06,714 --> 01:38:08,739
Was someone shouting something bad?

1156
01:38:08,816 --> 01:38:12,718
I didn't listen. Luckily, I'm hard of hearing.

1157
01:38:13,554 --> 01:38:17,251
Driving around on that old wreck
ruins your eardrums.

1158
01:38:18,459 --> 01:38:20,518
Well, maybe that's just as well.

1159
01:38:20,728 --> 01:38:23,925
I suppose you left Europe
to get away from that kind of thing.

1160
01:38:23,998 --> 01:38:26,523
To get away from that kind of thing?

1161
01:38:27,101 --> 01:38:29,934
Mr. Jackson,
we had a terrible journey coming here.

1162
01:38:30,638 --> 01:38:33,869
The children lost their dear mother
and their grandfather.

1163
01:38:34,041 --> 01:38:36,339
But we're here now. It's safe.

1164
01:38:36,710 --> 01:38:40,043
They can learn and play and grow up.

1165
01:38:40,748 --> 01:38:42,272
That kind of thing...

1166
01:38:42,583 --> 01:38:44,847
after what we've endured, what is it?

1167
01:38:45,286 --> 01:38:49,279
Nothing. I don't hear it.
The children don't hear it.

1168
01:39:06,273 --> 01:39:07,433
Sofia?

1169
01:39:08,309 --> 01:39:11,904
Yes? I'm here.

1170
01:39:13,013 --> 01:39:17,882
I had them put it in this tired little bag,
'cause I didn't want you getting robbed.

1171
01:39:35,235 --> 01:39:37,260
I'm not expecting a child.

1172
01:39:39,807 --> 01:39:43,470
I realize you might have thought that.
I don't want to deceive you.

1173
01:39:43,777 --> 01:39:45,540
- It's not for that.
- No, no, no.

1174
01:39:45,612 --> 01:39:48,240
I didn't think it was for anything like that.

1175
01:39:48,949 --> 01:39:53,010
I realize I might be helping you
go away from here...

1176
01:39:55,089 --> 01:39:56,784
away from me.

1177
01:39:58,892 --> 01:40:02,453
- You see, it's just...
- No, no, let's just leave it like this now.

1178
01:40:03,197 --> 01:40:05,688
No questions and no answers.

1179
01:40:07,601 --> 01:40:10,627
How much longer
do you think you can hide away in here?

1180
01:40:12,206 --> 01:40:16,370
I grew up with people
who believed in big heavy doors...

1181
01:40:16,443 --> 01:40:17,740
just like you.

1182
01:40:19,079 --> 01:40:21,547
But those doors
weren't so strong in the end.

1183
01:40:21,615 --> 01:40:22,946
I know.

1184
01:40:25,786 --> 01:40:27,947
Back when we first met...

1185
01:40:28,222 --> 01:40:31,589
you offered to let me touch your face...

1186
01:40:31,658 --> 01:40:33,057
so I could...

1187
01:40:33,127 --> 01:40:36,528
I could see what you looked like.
You remember that?

1188
01:40:38,565 --> 01:40:40,157
Yes, I remember.

1189
01:40:41,135 --> 01:40:43,660
Well, I was wondering if I could now...

1190
01:40:45,339 --> 01:40:48,399
take you up on that offer.

1191
01:40:51,712 --> 01:40:52,804
All right.

1192
01:40:54,314 --> 01:40:55,474
If you like.

1193
01:41:27,281 --> 01:41:30,580
Strange to think that all this time...

1194
01:41:31,819 --> 01:41:35,550
I never knew how beautiful you were.

1195
01:41:40,127 --> 01:41:44,359
But then, you see, I'm a blind man.

1196
01:41:54,741 --> 01:41:55,833
Thank you.

1197
01:42:00,414 --> 01:42:04,748
So what do you think? Am I magic?

1198
01:42:05,152 --> 01:42:06,983
No, you cheated.

1199
01:42:41,722 --> 01:42:43,656
This was announced yesterday.

1200
01:42:43,724 --> 01:42:48,218
Though it is barely a week since Sir James
declared it an impossibility...

1201
01:42:48,295 --> 01:42:50,422
for the Great Powers to stand back...

1202
01:42:50,497 --> 01:42:53,261
and leave the city
to the mercy of Japanese troops.

1203
01:42:53,333 --> 01:42:56,359
The question present just now is this.

1204
01:42:56,837 --> 01:43:00,568
What actions are realistically open
to any of the Powers?

1205
01:43:01,341 --> 01:43:04,538
Is it really practical
for Great Britain or France...

1206
01:43:04,611 --> 01:43:06,579
or indeed, the United States...

1207
01:43:06,647 --> 01:43:08,512
to take up arms at this time?

1208
01:43:56,697 --> 01:43:58,028
Mama!

1209
01:43:58,465 --> 01:44:01,400
We're going to Hong Kong.
There's a boat tonight.

1210
01:44:01,468 --> 01:44:03,800
- Tonight?
- Katya, we need to tie our things together.

1211
01:44:03,870 --> 01:44:05,701
Come and help me.

1212
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:08,098
Sofia.

1213
01:44:13,981 --> 01:44:15,471
The boat is leaving tonight.

1214
01:44:15,549 --> 01:44:18,382
We don't have much time,
but we must take this boat.

1215
01:44:18,452 --> 01:44:20,079
There will be no other.

1216
01:44:20,687 --> 01:44:22,985
Sofia, it's been decided.

1217
01:44:24,558 --> 01:44:27,425
You will wait a little longer. Wait here.

1218
01:44:29,296 --> 01:44:32,390
Decided? Decided by who?

1219
01:44:32,633 --> 01:44:33,861
The family.

1220
01:44:35,636 --> 01:44:38,662
Hong Kong is British,
very hard to buy the correct papers.

1221
01:44:38,739 --> 01:44:40,434
In the end...

1222
01:44:40,507 --> 01:44:43,772
we weren't able to buy papers for you, too.

1223
01:44:46,847 --> 01:44:48,246
But...

1224
01:44:49,182 --> 01:44:50,615
you're leaving me behind?

1225
01:44:50,684 --> 01:44:53,744
Only for a little while, then we send for you.

1226
01:44:54,054 --> 01:44:56,386
Oh, you'll be all right, my dear.

1227
01:44:56,456 --> 01:44:58,287
Sofia, it's for the best.

1228
01:44:58,358 --> 01:45:01,919
In Hong Kong,
family has a chance to start afresh.

1229
01:45:01,995 --> 01:45:05,556
We have old friends there.
We'll be accepted in society.

1230
01:45:06,333 --> 01:45:09,666
Katya will have a future there, a real future.

1231
01:45:10,370 --> 01:45:14,534
But none of this will be possible
if you are with us.

1232
01:45:15,942 --> 01:45:17,842
Surely you've thought of this.

1233
01:45:18,845 --> 01:45:22,076
It would be soon known what you did here.

1234
01:45:50,944 --> 01:45:52,411
We should go back.

1235
01:45:55,916 --> 01:45:58,214
We have an evening's work ahead of us.

1236
01:45:59,920 --> 01:46:01,888
We should go back immediately.

1237
01:46:02,356 --> 01:46:04,051
What's wrong with you today?

1238
01:46:04,124 --> 01:46:06,718
We should not go
to The White Countess this evening.

1239
01:46:06,793 --> 01:46:08,317
No customers coming.

1240
01:46:08,562 --> 01:46:11,793
Listen, Liu,
I'll decide where I go and don't go.

1241
01:46:17,437 --> 01:46:19,234
Mr. Jackson...

1242
01:46:19,339 --> 01:46:21,899
for a long time,
I do what you want me to do.

1243
01:46:21,975 --> 01:46:23,909
I see what you want me to see.

1244
01:46:24,211 --> 01:46:25,337
But today...

1245
01:46:25,412 --> 01:46:28,609
I tell you, it's time to stop. No more.

1246
01:46:29,082 --> 01:46:30,242
We go back.

1247
01:46:31,284 --> 01:46:35,311
All right, well, if you feel so strongly...

1248
01:46:36,390 --> 01:46:38,324
I'll just get there by myself.

1249
01:46:38,425 --> 01:46:39,858
Mr. Jackson.

1250
01:46:41,294 --> 01:46:42,818
Mr. Jackson.

1251
01:46:45,298 --> 01:46:46,822
Mr. Jackson!

1252
01:47:08,588 --> 01:47:10,078
Mr. Jackson.

1253
01:47:29,543 --> 01:47:31,101
Mr. Feinstein.

1254
01:47:32,112 --> 01:47:33,704
- Katya.
- We're leaving.

1255
01:47:34,281 --> 01:47:36,078
We're going to Hong Kong.

1256
01:48:17,424 --> 01:48:20,621
Why didn't you go with the others?
Why are you still here?

1257
01:48:22,062 --> 01:48:24,189
It's all right. It's for the best.

1258
01:48:28,802 --> 01:48:31,794
- They've left you.
- But...

1259
01:48:36,276 --> 01:48:39,336
And Katya? What have they told her?

1260
01:48:40,180 --> 01:48:44,879
Countess Sofia, answer me.
Where does Katya think you are?

1261
01:48:45,619 --> 01:48:47,746
They told her I was coming...

1262
01:48:47,888 --> 01:48:49,583
coming right behind.

1263
01:48:50,824 --> 01:48:55,523
And that I would meet them at the dock.
And I told her, too.

1264
01:48:55,595 --> 01:48:58,621
Countess Sofia, you must get her back.

1265
01:48:58,865 --> 01:49:01,197
But it's for the best.

1266
01:49:02,168 --> 01:49:04,898
- What future is there for her otherwise?
- No.

1267
01:49:04,971 --> 01:49:06,632
You must get her back.

1268
01:49:06,706 --> 01:49:09,539
Then the two of you
can leave Shanghai with us.

1269
01:49:09,609 --> 01:49:12,669
- Tonight.
- Leave? Leave where?

1270
01:49:13,313 --> 01:49:14,746
For Macao.

1271
01:49:14,848 --> 01:49:18,443
You must get Katya back and leave with us.

1272
01:49:19,953 --> 01:49:21,420
But how?

1273
01:49:24,891 --> 01:49:26,791
Glass please, gentlemen.

1274
01:50:17,544 --> 01:50:18,636
Be careful.

1275
01:51:37,257 --> 01:51:38,417
Mr. Jackson.

1276
01:51:40,260 --> 01:51:42,125
Mr. Matsuda.

1277
01:51:43,129 --> 01:51:45,996
It would appear
you are understaffed this evening.

1278
01:51:46,433 --> 01:51:47,593
So it seems.

1279
01:51:48,334 --> 01:51:51,497
I guess there's something
going on out there.

1280
01:51:51,705 --> 01:51:53,036
Mr. Jackson...

1281
01:51:53,339 --> 01:51:55,170
my car is outside.

1282
01:51:56,376 --> 01:51:58,640
Please allow me to take you to a safe place.

1283
01:51:58,712 --> 01:52:02,273
That's kind of you, sir,
but I have my customers to attend to.

1284
01:52:05,218 --> 01:52:08,187
And that'll be your broader canvas.

1285
01:52:10,523 --> 01:52:14,550
You know, Mr. Matsuda,
it's almost like you've made a fool of me.

1286
01:52:15,695 --> 01:52:20,359
All this time, you were helping me
perfect this little miniature here...

1287
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:25,494
you were busy, out there,
getting on with your broader canvas.

1288
01:52:25,572 --> 01:52:26,903
Mr. Jackson...

1289
01:52:29,042 --> 01:52:32,569
it meant much to me
that for a small moment in our lives...

1290
01:52:34,681 --> 01:52:36,740
we were able to be friends...

1291
01:52:36,950 --> 01:52:39,510
and create something of beauty
here together.

1292
01:52:43,490 --> 01:52:47,051
It would sadden me to think
you believed I have deceived you.

1293
01:52:47,127 --> 01:52:48,754
All right, well, maybe I don't.

1294
01:52:48,828 --> 01:52:50,989
But I feel a fool all the same.

1295
01:52:51,064 --> 01:52:55,364
And soon your broader canvas will come
and crush my little world in here.

1296
01:52:56,136 --> 01:52:59,936
Just like it's crushing
all those other little worlds right now.

1297
01:53:00,874 --> 01:53:03,069
But that is in the nature of things.

1298
01:53:05,845 --> 01:53:07,540
Now please, Mr. Jackson...

1299
01:53:09,849 --> 01:53:11,441
there isn't much time.

1300
01:53:12,051 --> 01:53:14,611
I urge you to leave with me immediately.

1301
01:53:15,522 --> 01:53:17,547
No, thank you, Mr. Matsuda.

1302
01:53:18,825 --> 01:53:22,056
This is where our paths have to divide.

1303
01:53:24,130 --> 01:53:25,927
In that case, Mr. Jackson...

1304
01:53:28,168 --> 01:53:29,692
I'll bid you goodbye.

1305
01:53:38,978 --> 01:53:40,411
Mr. Jackson...

1306
01:53:42,949 --> 01:53:44,974
since we may never meet again...

1307
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:51,056
perhaps you would allow me to put to you
something of a personal nature.

1308
01:53:52,392 --> 01:53:53,586
Feel free.

1309
01:53:54,327 --> 01:53:56,591
I realize I may be intruding...

1310
01:53:57,831 --> 01:54:02,427
but it has been my privilege to observe you
at close quarters for some time.

1311
01:54:03,636 --> 01:54:05,365
And I wonder if perhaps...

1312
01:54:06,172 --> 01:54:10,165
the time has come for you
to consider constructing another world.

1313
01:54:11,678 --> 01:54:13,805
Perhaps a world with your Countess.

1314
01:54:15,014 --> 01:54:18,609
The real White Countess, Countess Sofia.

1315
01:54:20,186 --> 01:54:21,551
This one here...

1316
01:54:23,923 --> 01:54:25,891
I fear its days are now numbered.

1317
01:54:25,959 --> 01:54:28,223
But it's too late now, Mr. Matsuda.

1318
01:54:29,863 --> 01:54:31,160
I let her go.

1319
01:54:32,332 --> 01:54:35,665
God knows
where she and Katya are by now.

1320
01:54:35,735 --> 01:54:37,726
Perhaps it is not too late.

1321
01:54:38,371 --> 01:54:40,805
I saw the Countess on my way here.

1322
01:54:41,007 --> 01:54:42,907
Like the rest of the crowd...

1323
01:54:43,109 --> 01:54:45,805
she was going
towards the sea guardian docks...

1324
01:54:46,145 --> 01:54:47,772
just a few minutes ago.

1325
01:54:49,115 --> 01:54:50,275
Now, sir...

1326
01:54:52,318 --> 01:54:54,081
if you'll excuse me.

1327
01:54:54,354 --> 01:54:56,584
I wish you every good fortune.

1328
01:55:59,986 --> 01:56:01,419
Excuse me.

1329
01:56:01,487 --> 01:56:03,352
Which way to the docks?

1330
01:56:05,591 --> 01:56:07,491
Which way to the docks?

1331
01:56:07,994 --> 01:56:09,359
Docks? This way.

1332
01:57:16,963 --> 01:57:20,922
Excuse me, gentlemen.
I'm just trying to find my way.

1333
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:29,171
Thank you.

1334
01:57:45,458 --> 01:57:47,016
Katya!

1335
01:57:49,228 --> 01:57:50,490
Katya!

1336
01:57:54,300 --> 01:57:57,030
Katya! Katya!

1337
01:57:57,670 --> 01:57:59,638
Don't worry, my darling.
She'll come very soon.

1338
01:57:59,705 --> 01:58:01,798
But why isn't she here?

1339
01:58:02,308 --> 01:58:05,573
You promised.
You promised she'd be waiting.

1340
01:58:24,163 --> 01:58:25,152
Excuse me.

1341
01:58:25,231 --> 01:58:28,792
Have you seen a Russian family?

1342
01:58:29,068 --> 01:58:30,592
A little girl.

1343
01:58:30,670 --> 01:58:31,796
Russian.

1344
01:58:39,879 --> 01:58:41,369
Mr. Jackson!

1345
01:58:42,014 --> 01:58:43,675
Mr. Jackson!

1346
01:58:46,452 --> 01:58:47,919
But we can't go yet.

1347
01:58:48,988 --> 01:58:50,683
She's coming, isn't she?

1348
01:58:51,891 --> 01:58:54,086
Where's Mama, Aunt Vera?

1349
01:58:56,162 --> 01:58:58,153
Mama!

1350
01:58:59,065 --> 01:59:03,024
- Mr. Jackson, Mr. Jackson, it's me.
- What?

1351
01:59:03,102 --> 01:59:07,004
- Feinstein. The Countess' neighbor.
- Oh, yes, yes.

1352
01:59:07,073 --> 01:59:11,203
- Mr. Jackson, they've taken Katya.
- Who has taken her?

1353
01:59:11,277 --> 01:59:12,471
The family.

1354
01:59:12,545 --> 01:59:16,777
They've left Countess Sofia behind.
She's down there looking for her.

1355
01:59:20,820 --> 01:59:22,082
No, wait.

1356
01:59:24,223 --> 01:59:25,247
Katya.

1357
01:59:25,324 --> 01:59:28,191
Mama! Mama!

1358
01:59:28,294 --> 01:59:30,455
Mama!

1359
01:59:30,530 --> 01:59:34,762
- Katya, get down, child!
- Why is Mama so late? She has to hurry.

1360
01:59:34,867 --> 01:59:36,562
She'll be here soon.

1361
01:59:36,636 --> 01:59:39,469
And if she doesn't come,
we'll wait for her on the boat.

1362
01:59:39,539 --> 01:59:41,439
She'll board by another boat.

1363
01:59:41,908 --> 01:59:43,637
There are some steps here.

1364
01:59:44,877 --> 01:59:46,868
Turn right. Excuse me.

1365
01:59:49,215 --> 01:59:51,046
Mama!

1366
01:59:51,584 --> 01:59:53,518
Mama!

1367
01:59:53,786 --> 01:59:57,779
- Step. Step.
- Mr. Feinstein! Diplomat!

1368
01:59:57,857 --> 01:59:59,222
Katya!

1369
01:59:59,325 --> 02:00:01,316
- Come on. Right now, sit down right away.
- Katya!

1370
02:00:05,894 --> 02:00:08,658
Katya, your mother's with me.
She's not coming.

1371
02:00:08,730 --> 02:00:11,392
- Go away, you dirty Jew! Get out of here.
- Katya, don't listen to that.

1372
02:00:11,466 --> 02:00:14,299
Katya, your mother is not coming with you.

1373
02:00:15,871 --> 02:00:17,771
- Katya, come with me.
- What do you want with us?

1374
02:00:17,839 --> 02:00:18,828
Go on! Leave!

1375
02:00:18,907 --> 02:00:20,431
Don't listen to them.

1376
02:00:20,509 --> 02:00:22,101
Go back to your sewers.

1377
02:00:22,544 --> 02:00:23,533
Boatman! Go, go, go!

1378
02:00:23,612 --> 02:00:24,636
Your mother's not coming.

1379
02:00:24,713 --> 02:00:25,737
Leave! Go on!

1380
02:00:25,814 --> 02:00:26,803
She's with me. She's looking.

1381
02:00:26,882 --> 02:00:28,509
Your mother is with me.

1382
02:00:28,583 --> 02:00:30,574
- Katya.
- Look, Katya.

1383
02:00:30,852 --> 02:00:32,877
Come on. Your mother's waiting.

1384
02:00:34,823 --> 02:00:36,916
It's time to take that boat ride.

1385
02:00:37,192 --> 02:00:38,989
- Give me your hand.
- Our boat ride.

1386
02:00:39,061 --> 02:00:42,690
Katya! Katya! Katya!

1387
02:00:42,764 --> 02:00:44,629
- Mama!
- Katya!

1388
02:00:44,699 --> 02:00:46,633
- Mama!
- Katya!

1389
02:00:46,701 --> 02:00:47,793
Mama!

1390
02:00:47,969 --> 02:00:51,029
Katya! Katya, my darling!

1391
02:00:54,309 --> 02:00:55,799
Mama, where have you been?

1392
02:00:55,877 --> 02:00:58,345
I'm so sorry, Mama was wrong.

1393
02:00:58,447 --> 02:01:01,109
We'll leave together somewhere else.

1394
02:01:04,419 --> 02:01:05,977
Katya!

1395
02:01:07,923 --> 02:01:10,391
Katya!

1396
02:01:11,359 --> 02:01:13,384
Katya!

1397
02:01:14,162 --> 02:01:17,325
Katya Belinskya!

1398
02:01:17,632 --> 02:01:19,998
Not my baby!

1399
02:01:20,669 --> 02:01:22,102
Katya!

1400
02:02:08,984 --> 02:02:12,476
Try to sleep. Close your eyes.

1401
02:02:56,665 --> 02:02:58,223
We'll be going soon.

1402
02:03:03,872 --> 02:03:05,237
Mr. Feinstein?

1403
02:03:05,307 --> 02:03:08,140
- Yeah. I'm here, Mr. Jackson.
- Here you go.

1404
02:03:09,211 --> 02:03:10,610
Thank you so much.

1405
02:03:11,980 --> 02:03:15,108
Look, what are you doing?
Why don't you stay still?

1406
02:03:15,183 --> 02:03:17,651
Well, actually, I was trying to find you.

1407
02:03:18,019 --> 02:03:20,749
Why do you have to wander off?
You'll have a stupid accident.

1408
02:03:20,822 --> 02:03:23,620
You're right. I'm sorry.
I'm acting irresponsibly.

1409
02:03:24,859 --> 02:03:25,848
Come.

1410
02:03:33,835 --> 02:03:36,133
Here. That's for you.

1411
02:03:42,010 --> 02:03:44,843
Thank you for coming to help us earlier.

1412
02:03:45,747 --> 02:03:48,443
I wasn't expecting to see you there. It was...

1413
02:03:50,518 --> 02:03:51,883
a surprise.

1414
02:03:52,654 --> 02:03:56,954
Well, as a matter of fact,
I wasn't coming just to help.

1415
02:03:57,359 --> 02:03:58,724
I was hoping...

1416
02:04:00,228 --> 02:04:04,028
Well, I realize I'm... Look, here I am...

1417
02:04:04,966 --> 02:04:06,490
a blind man...

1418
02:04:06,801 --> 02:04:09,998
out alone in the dangerous world.

1419
02:04:10,872 --> 02:04:13,363
I was wondering if you...

1420
02:04:13,975 --> 02:04:16,808
that is, you and Katya, I was thinking...

1421
02:04:17,912 --> 02:04:19,937
you might like to help me.

1422
02:04:22,083 --> 02:04:26,247
And if you'd do that,
I thought I'd do my best to help you.

1423
02:04:28,356 --> 02:04:29,880
I realize this is...

1424
02:04:29,958 --> 02:04:32,552
it's not the ideal time
to be discussing such a matter.

1425
02:04:32,627 --> 02:04:35,858
No, it's a good time. A good time.

1426
02:04:37,532 --> 02:04:40,023
As you say, we can help each other.

1427
02:04:41,803 --> 02:04:44,465
And we can start by you staying here...

1428
02:04:45,507 --> 02:04:48,567
and not doing something
to get us all in trouble.

1429
02:04:50,512 --> 02:04:53,970
Okay. Okay, Countess.

1430
02:04:56,017 --> 02:04:57,814
I'll stay right here.

1431
02:05:19,808 --> 02:05:23,744
Wake up! Hurry!

1432
02:05:25,880 --> 02:05:29,407
Hurry! Come on!

1433
02:06:34,949 --> 02:06:36,314
It's just me.

1434
02:06:40,688 --> 02:06:43,680
This is hardly the boat ride we talked about.

1435
02:06:44,526 --> 02:06:45,857
I'm sorry.

1436
02:15:36,000 --> 02:15:37,857
{{{ the end }}}
