I spin the chamber

784

Amazing. Teddz Bear.

Your daughter's having a wild time.

01:06:48,423 --> 01:06:52,416
Your daughter's had Ecstasy.

They're in your hands.

809
01:07:37,405 --> 01:07:42,240
If you try anything funny. if you brought
cops or bodyguards or anyone strange.

810
01:07:42,310 --> 01:07:44,403
the first people to die will be kids.

811
01:07:44,479 --> 01:07:46,674
- You think we're assholes?
- No.

812
01:07:46,748 --> 01:07:49,615
OK. You're the asshole.

813
01:07:50,385 --> 01:07:54,048
I want you to say you're an asshole.
Go on. say it.

814
01:07:54,122 --> 01:07:56,682
- Huh?
- I'm an asshole. zeah. I'm an asshole.

815
01:07:56,758 --> 01:07:59,921
Keep walking. Keep walking. now.

816
01:07:59,995 --> 01:08:01,895
Move it! Move it!

817
01:08:01,963 --> 01:08:04,022
Go down the stairs.

01:08:20,682 --> 01:08:24,277
All right. Go all the way down those stairs.

823
01:08:24,352 --> 01:08:28,686
There are some lockers down there.
one of them's your tasty daughter's.

824
01:08:28,757 --> 01:08:32,454
Oh. Carla's tasty. man.
Keep going down.

825
01:08:32,527 --> 01:08:36,054
Down. When you get to the bottom.
there's a room.

826
01:08:36,131 --> 01:08:40,693
There's a room with some lockers.
and the locker that says "Carla Gutiérrez".

827
01:08:40,769 --> 01:08:42,828
that's where you leave the briefcase.

828
01:08:42,904 --> 01:08:45,031

01:09:56,277 --> 01:10:00,338
- Where will zou leave her?
- None of your business. I do what I want.

833
01:10:00,415 --> 01:10:03,179
You're in no position to tell me what to do.

834
01:10:03,251 --> 01:10:06,687
Follow orders if you want her to live.

835
01:10:06,755 --> 01:10:09,690
Don't fuck me around.

836
01:10:09,758 --> 01:10:13,455
How do... How do I know...
How do I know zou won't hurt her?

837
01:10:13,528 --> 01:10:16,986
"How do I know you won't hurt her?"
Enough with your faggy voice.

838
01:10:17,065 --> 01:10:20,592
Trust. Daddy.
Trust that your daughter'll be OK.

839
01:10:20,668 --> 01:10:24,661
Trust the negro. I'm not playing.
