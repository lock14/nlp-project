Martin Zomer

8
00:03:10,912 --> 00:03:13,028
I want to know your name first.

9
00:04:16,272 --> 00:04:17,910
Goodbye, stranger.

10
00:04:45,632 --> 00:04:48,271
Jesus... Milan.

11
00:04:49,472 --> 00:04:50,951
I thought you'd left.

12
00:04:51,992 --> 00:04:55,109
Would you have preferred that?
-Of course not.

13
00:04:56,512 --> 00:04:59,629
What's wrong?
Why aren't you in bed?

14
00:05:00,752 --> 00:05:02,231
Why do you think?

15
00:05:06,792 --> 00:05:09,909
I love you, Simone.

16
00:05:10,112 --> 00:05:13,104
I love you.
-Sweetheart.

17
00:05:15,672 --> 00:05:17,503
What's wrong?

18
00:05:19,672 --> 00:05:23,301
You cheated on me before my own eyes.

19
00:05:24,192 --> 00:05:28,549
You gave yourself so easily to him.

20
00:05:29,752 --> 00:05:34,542
As if it didn't cost you any effort.
-That's because I knew it was you.

21
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:37,391
That's not true.
I was a complete stranger.

22
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:41,591
That's because you did it so well.

23
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:46,547
Pretending not to know which floor
I lived on. Pure genius.

24
00:05:46,752 --> 00:05:49,869
You're such a great faker.

25
00:05:50,992 --> 00:05:55,508
So are you.
-With you everything could be fake.

26
00:05:55,712 --> 00:06:00,832
But it isn't. You know I love you.
-You'd say the same to him.

27
00:06:01,032 --> 00:06:04,820
As I'm doing now, right?
You are him.

28
00:06:06,512 --> 00:06:11,632
You are my one and only true love.

29
00:06:11,832 --> 00:06:14,585
Words, Simone...
-But beautiful words.

30
00:06:14,792 --> 00:06:19,912
Yes. But right now I don't know
what those words mean.

31
00:06:21,312 --> 00:06:26,511
They mean I love you... I'm certain.

32
00:06:33,392 --> 00:06:37,271
There's only one way to find out.
-How?

33
00:06:43,352 --> 00:06:44,910
You don't want to know.

34
00:07:33,552 --> 00:07:36,510
Hi, this is Milan.
I'm away for a while.

35
00:07:36,712 --> 00:07:41,547
I won't be using this number for now,
so you can't leave a message.

36
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:43,105
Especially not you.

37
00:08:16,152 --> 00:08:18,108
There you go.
-Thanks.

38
00:08:34,992 --> 00:08:36,903
Don't be late next time.

39
00:08:40,912 --> 00:08:45,190
This is Simone from Synovate.
Could I have a moment of your time?

40
00:08:46,472 --> 00:08:50,784
It concerns the ageing of Dutch society.
Can I ask you some questions?

41
00:09:01,752 --> 00:09:03,504
Hi, this is Milan...

42
00:09:40,432 --> 00:09:43,230
Have you... seen... Milan?

43
00:09:44,352 --> 00:09:47,662
Seen... Milan?
-I don't have time for this.

44
00:10:02,792 --> 00:10:04,191
THE BAR

45
00:10:08,392 --> 00:10:09,745
What can I get you?

46
00:10:10,912 --> 00:10:12,265
Could... argh... uh...

47
00:10:13,552 --> 00:10:17,306
I'd...
-Here. Show me.

48
00:10:19,312 --> 00:10:22,588
I told you to show me.

49
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:25,545
Vegetarian Special.
Anything else?

50
00:10:28,392 --> 00:10:32,385
Enjoy your meal.
Just wave when you need me.

51
00:10:33,432 --> 00:10:35,024
Exactly.

52
00:11:36,152 --> 00:11:37,949
Have you started yet?

53
00:11:43,712 --> 00:11:47,068
Where are you?
-That's not important.

54
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,908
When will I see you again?

55
00:11:52,112 --> 00:11:54,990
Haven't you read my letter yet?

56
00:11:58,312 --> 00:12:00,268
Are you afraid to read it?

57
00:12:02,272 --> 00:12:07,221
Of course not.
-Okay, I'll call again sometime.

58
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:35,183
Beautiful. Thanks.
-Wasn't it too much?

59
00:12:35,392 --> 00:12:39,624
Not at all. Cut.
Beautiful.

60
00:12:39,832 --> 00:12:43,791
Did you get it right, Martin?
-Yes. Super.

61
00:12:43,992 --> 00:12:46,904
Okay everybody, let's wrap it up.
Tomorrow's another day.

62
00:13:09,832 --> 00:13:11,902
We can discuss that later...

63
00:13:14,872 --> 00:13:17,466
The view makes our job so attractive.

64
00:13:17,672 --> 00:13:21,551
We see them, but they can't see us.
Use it to your advantage.

65
00:13:24,552 --> 00:13:30,070
Good, but you're turning it into
a bit of an act. Don't do that.

66
00:13:30,272 --> 00:13:35,744
I'm trying to add an extra layer here.
Otherwise, the character will be empty.

67
00:13:35,952 --> 00:13:40,503
He's got to have something special
about him, don't you think?

68
00:13:40,712 --> 00:13:43,863
A certain talent.
-He doesn't have to be talented.

69
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:47,348
Maybe that's the wrong word.

70
00:13:47,552 --> 00:13:50,146
Make him normal.
-Not talented but...

71
00:13:50,352 --> 00:13:53,549
A sort of depth.
-Something special.

72
00:13:53,752 --> 00:13:57,301
Don't you agree? A certain presence.

73
00:13:57,512 --> 00:14:00,072
Actually it's quite simple.
You only have to cut a cucumber.

74
00:14:00,272 --> 00:14:06,108
Why not with a bit of flair?
-It's not theater.

75
00:14:06,312 --> 00:14:09,349
Shall we do it again?
-Just do it again.

76
00:14:09,552 --> 00:14:11,190
It's not theater, it's film.

77
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:15,590
Make him normal. The film's called
Real Life for a reason. Get it?

78
00:14:15,792 --> 00:14:21,185
I get it, but aren't there people
with talent in real life as well?

79
00:14:21,392 --> 00:14:25,670
Make it less theatrical.
Just cut the vegetables.

80
00:14:25,872 --> 00:14:30,070
You know how to cut.
Teach him.

81
00:14:30,272 --> 00:14:32,786
It'll be fine.
-I'm really trying.

82
00:14:32,992 --> 00:14:36,621
Try less.
Maybe that's it.

83
00:14:36,832 --> 00:14:42,907
The view makes our job so attractive.
-You still have that look.

84
00:14:43,112 --> 00:14:48,630
Hold on. I hadn't even started yet.
Give me space to set it up.

85
00:14:51,352 --> 00:14:53,661
With all due respect.

86
00:14:56,472 --> 00:15:01,307
The view makes our job so attractive.
We see them, but they can't see us.

87
00:15:01,512 --> 00:15:03,150
Use it to your advantage.

88
00:15:05,312 --> 00:15:07,030
Say your lines.

89
00:15:09,712 --> 00:15:12,465
I thought we were just rehearsing
this moment.

90
00:15:15,792 --> 00:15:19,102
I want some coffee.
Irene, can we have coffee?

91
00:15:19,312 --> 00:15:22,907
Come on, guys.
-Martin, come on.

92
00:15:24,192 --> 00:15:27,423
I don't understand him.
-Let's do it again.

93
00:15:27,632 --> 00:15:32,501
But wouldn't it be nice...
-I don't need...

94
00:15:32,712 --> 00:15:38,742
Let me finish. Maybe it's a good idea
if he brings his own knife.

95
00:15:38,952 --> 00:15:41,386
He has his own personal knife.

96
00:15:41,592 --> 00:15:46,347
You definitely won't bring your own knife.
-He stands like this and goes...

97
00:15:46,552 --> 00:15:48,907
He turns around a few times
and then...

98
00:15:49,112 --> 00:15:51,580
Fjodor...
-Something like this.

99
00:15:51,792 --> 00:15:58,265
Not like that, of course.
-Just listen for once.

100
00:15:58,472 --> 00:16:03,705
I've been listening all along.
-Listen and don't interrupt.

101
00:16:03,912 --> 00:16:07,063
You won't turn it into an act.
You won't bring a knife

102
00:16:07,272 --> 00:16:10,582
You come into
a fully-stocked kitchen.

103
00:16:10,792 --> 00:16:14,705
You came in... You...
I don't how how to say it.

104
00:16:14,912 --> 00:16:19,110
You're just cutting a cucumber.
Let's focus on that.

105
00:16:19,312 --> 00:16:23,544
And then everything will be fine.

106
00:16:25,392 --> 00:16:28,668
I'm going to get coffee.
-I'd like a cappuccino.

107
00:16:28,872 --> 00:16:31,545
What do you want?
-Tea, please.

108
00:16:31,752 --> 00:16:35,950
Are we going to do it again?
Or do you want coffee first?

109
00:18:14,312 --> 00:18:15,665
Dirk...

110
00:18:22,032 --> 00:18:25,422
It doesn't matter.
-lt was fine.

111
00:18:25,632 --> 00:18:28,021
Sorry, Simone.
-Again.

112
00:18:40,592 --> 00:18:42,947
I saw Dirk's face again.

113
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:46,460
Concentration, please.

114
00:18:48,552 --> 00:18:49,826
Action.

115
00:19:46,072 --> 00:19:47,551
Milan?
-Well?

116
00:19:48,112 --> 00:19:49,909
Yes, I found someone.

117
00:19:50,112 --> 00:19:52,546
He's really nice.

118
00:19:52,992 --> 00:19:54,345
Sensitive.

119
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:56,545
Special.

120
00:19:57,712 --> 00:19:59,111
Are you in love?

121
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:01,985
Of course.

122
00:20:09,472 --> 00:20:12,305
This way we'll never
see each other again.

123
00:20:12,672 --> 00:20:17,427
I know it's difficult,
but I miss you too.

124
00:20:18,512 --> 00:20:22,903
So come back to me.
-No, we have to persevere.

125
00:20:23,112 --> 00:20:25,182
Otherwise, we're no good.

126
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,986
This proves it too, doesn't it?

127
00:20:28,192 --> 00:20:30,706
I didn't write that letter
for nothing.

128
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:33,472
Just do as I asked.

129
00:20:33,672 --> 00:20:36,744
Find someone and fall in love.

130
00:21:08,952 --> 00:21:12,308
There you go.
Hey, girl.

131
00:21:12,512 --> 00:21:15,185
Have a seat.
I'll be right with you.

132
00:21:20,952 --> 00:21:24,308
The view makes our job so attractive.

133
00:21:24,512 --> 00:21:27,948
We see them, but they can't see us.

134
00:21:28,152 --> 00:21:31,747
Not like that, Fjodor.

135
00:21:31,952 --> 00:21:34,785
Stand beside me
and look at me.

136
00:21:35,832 --> 00:21:41,145
The view makes our job so attractive.
We see them, but they don't see us.

137
00:21:41,352 --> 00:21:42,785
Who cares?

138
00:21:44,952 --> 00:21:50,390
Sjon, we can talk about this forever,
but you're just here for the tidbits.

139
00:21:50,592 --> 00:21:52,423
Get it?

140
00:21:52,672 --> 00:21:56,187
Do you see this? And this?
Watch.

141
00:21:56,472 --> 00:21:58,827
Tid-bit-tid-bit-tid-bit.

142
00:21:59,032 --> 00:22:02,229
Get it?
Your turn.

143
00:22:05,072 --> 00:22:09,827
Damn it, Fjodor.
Stop it, asshole.

144
00:22:10,032 --> 00:22:15,345
Jesus Christ. You're doing it
on purpose. Get lost.

145
00:22:15,552 --> 00:22:20,023
You don't even give him a chance.
-He doesn't deserve it.

146
00:22:20,232 --> 00:22:23,463
Now what?
-Dirk, come here.

147
00:22:23,672 --> 00:22:25,822
Hey, girl.

148
00:22:26,032 --> 00:22:28,307
Have a seat.
I'll be right with you.

149
00:22:36,192 --> 00:22:42,142
The view makes our job so attractive.
-The camera isn't in position yet.

150
00:22:42,352 --> 00:22:45,150
I told you this wouldn't work.
-Take it easy.

151
00:22:45,352 --> 00:22:47,946
We'll just do it again.
It happens.

152
00:22:48,152 --> 00:22:52,907
My hat isn't comfortable, so...
-Attention, everyone.

153
00:22:53,112 --> 00:22:54,750
Are you ready, Dirk?

154
00:22:57,072 --> 00:23:02,021
Don't worry, everything
will be fine. And action!

155
00:23:04,952 --> 00:23:10,709
The view makes our job so attractive.
You see them, but they can't see you.

156
00:23:10,912 --> 00:23:12,584
Use it to your advantage.

157
00:23:13,912 --> 00:23:15,231
Hey Sjon...

158
00:23:17,432 --> 00:23:21,630
I didn't realize you meant me.

159
00:23:21,832 --> 00:23:24,630
I'm Dirk.
-Arif. Nice to meet you.

160
00:23:29,592 --> 00:23:32,982
Tid-bit-tid-bit. Get it?

161
00:23:33,192 --> 00:23:35,023
Yes. Tid-bit.

162
00:23:36,272 --> 00:23:37,990
Good. Your turn.

163
00:23:44,632 --> 00:23:47,669
Give it to me,
before we have an accident.

164
00:23:47,872 --> 00:23:52,229
Three spareribs and
a Vegetarian Special for the dumbo.

165
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:55,868
Loes means to say: the dumb one.
-It's sad. She can't talk.

166
00:23:56,072 --> 00:23:57,744
That's what I'm saying.
-I wish you were dumb.

167
00:23:57,952 --> 00:24:01,422
Your yapping makes us all sad.
-Hands off.

168
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:02,501
Poor girl. It's not easy,
living with a handicap.

169
00:25:17,192 --> 00:25:18,545
Want a drink?

170
00:25:19,672 --> 00:25:23,904
I promised my wife
I wouldn't be late.

171
00:25:25,752 --> 00:25:27,105
Another time?

172
00:25:32,272 --> 00:25:34,627
You did well, man.
Thanks.

173
00:25:36,192 --> 00:25:37,545
Bye.

174
00:26:37,832 --> 00:26:41,666
Angelique, whore.
-End board.

175
00:26:47,592 --> 00:26:48,945
Are you okay?

176
00:26:49,792 --> 00:26:54,786
What happened to you, man?
-I fell down the stairs.

177
00:26:54,992 --> 00:26:58,348
Then you probably don't live
on the first floor.

178
00:26:58,552 --> 00:27:01,828
Could I stay at your place tonight?

179
00:27:02,032 --> 00:27:05,388
I had a huge fight with my wife,
Angelique.

180
00:27:05,592 --> 00:27:09,471
Did she do this?
-What the heck happened to you?

181
00:27:12,032 --> 00:27:14,421
I just told you. That...

182
00:27:17,712 --> 00:27:20,784
Sorry, I can't do this.

183
00:27:20,992 --> 00:27:25,383
Can't I just try it
the way I would do it?

184
00:27:25,912 --> 00:27:29,791
I mean, it's not realistic to say:
my wife Angelique...

185
00:27:29,992 --> 00:27:31,345
Take fifteen.

186
00:27:35,672 --> 00:27:37,469
A whisky please.

187
00:27:53,512 --> 00:27:54,991
Could I perhaps...

188
00:27:57,432 --> 00:27:59,070
stay at your place tonight?

189
00:28:01,592 --> 00:28:03,981
I caught my wife in bed
with another man.

190
00:28:07,592 --> 00:28:11,107
Some muscular type.
She likes those.

191
00:28:14,272 --> 00:28:17,184
I don't understand why
I feel so hurt this time.

192
00:28:17,392 --> 00:28:21,351
Has it happened before?
-And you put up with it?

193
00:28:21,552 --> 00:28:23,782
Of course.
What else can I do?

194
00:28:25,032 --> 00:28:28,388
I won't leave my kids with her.
-Your kids?

195
00:28:28,592 --> 00:28:30,344
Doesn't matter. Keep going.

196
00:28:32,272 --> 00:28:35,389
Charity and Lafurtery
are my two little girls.

197
00:28:38,352 --> 00:28:41,389
I sometimes feel that Clarisse...
-Who?

198
00:28:41,592 --> 00:28:42,945
Clarisse.

199
00:28:45,112 --> 00:28:49,981
My wife.
-Oh, your wife... okay

200
00:28:51,992 --> 00:28:57,191
I sometimes feel she only sees me
as my own children's babysitter.

201
00:28:58,992 --> 00:29:01,586
I wish she was more
like she used to be.

202
00:29:03,152 --> 00:29:04,824
But that's the funny thing...

203
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:10,421
In that tough face of hers
I still see the sweetheart she once was.

204
00:29:10,632 --> 00:29:15,023
She was so pretty,
with gorgeous dark curls like you.

205
00:29:16,392 --> 00:29:19,668
When I think of that,
I can't get angry anymore.

206
00:29:19,872 --> 00:29:21,988
Even though I'd like to.

207
00:29:24,472 --> 00:29:26,542
Even though I'd really like to.

208
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,505
Well done, man.

209
00:29:42,512 --> 00:29:46,221
Maestro.
Thank you.

210
00:29:46,432 --> 00:29:50,948
From now on we'll do everything
the way you would do it.

211
00:29:53,192 --> 00:29:54,466
Beautiful.

212
00:30:13,992 --> 00:30:18,622
That's not right. It says: Sjon.
And I'm Dirk now.

213
00:30:58,432 --> 00:31:00,582
Daddy.
Look behind you.

214
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:06,025
Sweetie, did that scare you?
-It's just for the film.

215
00:31:06,232 --> 00:31:10,464
Look, it's Paul. It's not real.
-You don't need to be scared.

216
00:31:11,832 --> 00:31:15,984
Wimp. Get lost.
Stay away.

217
00:31:17,952 --> 00:31:19,863
Doormat.

218
00:32:05,112 --> 00:32:08,661
What? Did you think I was making
those hysterical noises?

219
00:32:08,872 --> 00:32:12,831
I thought you were a couple.

220
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:16,263
No, I choose my men more carefully.

221
00:32:18,072 --> 00:32:20,586
Have some.
-Thanks.

222
00:32:33,432 --> 00:32:36,265
In a while,
he'll start playing guitar.

223
00:32:36,472 --> 00:32:37,825
Just wait.

224
00:32:50,872 --> 00:32:52,863
He always does that.

225
00:32:53,072 --> 00:32:57,668
I guess it's some
twisted kind of shyness.

226
00:32:57,872 --> 00:33:02,992
It can be tough if you have to talk
to girls.

227
00:33:08,832 --> 00:33:11,471
Nice story yesterday
at The Bar.

228
00:33:11,672 --> 00:33:13,025
Thank you.

229
00:33:29,592 --> 00:33:31,981
Can you do the dishes?

230
00:33:33,032 --> 00:33:34,624
I'm not here.

231
00:33:40,632 --> 00:33:42,748
This is Simone from Synovate.

232
00:33:42,952 --> 00:33:46,547
Do you think I could fall in love
with you?

233
00:33:46,752 --> 00:33:48,982
With me?

234
00:33:52,072 --> 00:33:54,632
That's difficult to say.

235
00:33:56,712 --> 00:33:59,943
Why's that?
-Because it's...

236
00:34:02,792 --> 00:34:07,308
It's just that it's easy
to hurt each other.

237
00:34:11,312 --> 00:34:13,030
Have you ever hurt anyone?

238
00:34:14,672 --> 00:34:17,061
Or were you the one
who was hurt?

239
00:34:19,272 --> 00:34:22,309
I'm sorry.
-Go on. Don't be shy.

240
00:34:23,832 --> 00:34:28,383
Suddenly she started talking about love.
-That was wonderful.

241
00:34:28,592 --> 00:34:31,345
I didn't know.
-lt was just so...

242
00:34:31,552 --> 00:34:33,588
Funny?
-lt doesn't matter.

243
00:34:35,432 --> 00:34:36,785
Are you still there?

244
00:34:51,992 --> 00:34:53,345
I'll be right back.

245
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:57,340
Why didn't you tell me earlier?
I have to go to work.

246
00:34:57,552 --> 00:34:59,827
That jerk put the alarm
an hour behind.

247
00:35:00,032 --> 00:35:03,581
Tjaltje, I wanted some quality time
together. So what?

248
00:35:04,632 --> 00:35:09,706
Hey, what's wrong with you?
-He's still worried about his wife.

249
00:35:09,912 --> 00:35:13,382
Wimp. If you want your wife back,
take a girlfriend.

250
00:35:13,592 --> 00:35:15,787
You can't just take someone.
-Why not?

251
00:35:15,992 --> 00:35:18,790
I took you.
A few times even.

252
00:35:18,992 --> 00:35:21,267
Bye.

253
00:35:30,672 --> 00:35:33,186
This beats cooking.

254
00:35:36,392 --> 00:35:38,030
Can you get that?

255
00:35:48,752 --> 00:35:50,424
Anyone there?

256
00:37:15,592 --> 00:37:18,060
Hey girl, you look good.

257
00:37:38,952 --> 00:37:40,863
Daily Dish or Vegetarian?

258
00:37:42,232 --> 00:37:45,781
Vegetarian. And to drink:
red, white?

259
00:37:48,632 --> 00:37:52,864
If she has the hiccups but is still
at it, you're doing something right.

260
00:37:53,072 --> 00:37:55,302
'Vegetarian' for the dumbo.

261
00:37:55,512 --> 00:37:59,346
Not so loud. She'll hear you.
-Why? I'm not saying anything wrong, am l?

262
00:38:00,392 --> 00:38:04,624
So, you were really going at it?
-Powerfully.

263
00:38:04,832 --> 00:38:09,383
At every hiccup I was ejected.
I've never experienced that before.

264
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:13,230
Keep going.
-At every hiccup I was ejected.

265
00:38:13,432 --> 00:38:16,424
At every hiccup I was ejected.

266
00:38:16,632 --> 00:38:19,704
Such power. I've never
experienced that before.

267
00:38:19,912 --> 00:38:24,224
Me neither.
Must be a matter of size.

268
00:38:26,112 --> 00:38:27,465
What do you mean by that?

269
00:38:28,752 --> 00:38:33,701
That your little Luke is rather small, Luke.
-Or Tjaltje's hiccups were very bad.

270
00:38:39,032 --> 00:38:41,910
Let's talk about you.
-About me?

271
00:38:42,992 --> 00:38:45,142
Loes, we need female input.

272
00:38:45,352 --> 00:38:49,868
Suppose Dirk loves his wife.
-He does, judging by his stories.

273
00:38:50,072 --> 00:38:54,384
But she cheats on him a lot.
What should he do to get her back?

274
00:38:56,672 --> 00:39:00,426
Get a girlfriend, probably.
-You see?

275
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:04,102
But I don't want a girlfriend.
-That doesn't matter.

276
00:39:04,312 --> 00:39:08,942
Loes, how do you feel about Dirk?
-Well, Luke, that's an idea.

277
00:39:09,152 --> 00:39:14,784
Could be interesting. Bald.
Sturdily built. A good cook.

278
00:39:17,912 --> 00:39:19,823
That's no coincidence, my friend.

279
00:39:20,032 --> 00:39:22,705
What isn't?
-That you're looking at dumbo.

280
00:39:22,912 --> 00:39:25,506
It's just...
-She's the perfect candidate.

281
00:39:25,712 --> 00:39:28,465
And she won't ever
sound smarter than you.

282
00:39:32,272 --> 00:39:36,948
Dear Simone,
As I was trying to tell you...

283
00:39:37,152 --> 00:39:41,623
I can't trust you anymore
so something has to happen.

284
00:39:41,832 --> 00:39:46,383
I guess it will take some time
before you can forgive me this.

285
00:39:46,592 --> 00:39:50,107
I know it will be hard,
but I want you to forget me.

286
00:39:51,152 --> 00:39:53,825
I've disappeared, as you can see.

287
00:39:54,032 --> 00:39:58,742
I won't return until I feel you've
found happiness with someone else.

288
00:39:58,952 --> 00:40:03,901
Only then will I know
what we truly mean to each other.

289
00:40:05,352 --> 00:40:07,661
And then you'll have to choose.

290
00:40:07,872 --> 00:40:12,548
I have to know. So, please,
search for someone you like.

291
00:40:12,752 --> 00:40:16,222
Someone you can trust
and feel safe with.

292
00:40:16,432 --> 00:40:19,708
But search for someone
you can start over with.

293
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:22,868
Only then will I return.

294
00:40:24,152 --> 00:40:25,505
Only then.

295
00:40:36,752 --> 00:40:38,105
Hey, Luke.

296
00:40:39,632 --> 00:40:42,066
Usually, it only lasts one night.

297
00:40:52,072 --> 00:40:55,030
Hurry up.
This is your chance, man.

298
00:40:56,992 --> 00:40:58,471
Go and say hi.

299
00:41:09,712 --> 00:41:11,942
I think you forgot something.

300
00:41:22,592 --> 00:41:23,945
The letter.

301
00:41:27,072 --> 00:41:31,463
Don't I get a kiss
as finder's fee?

302
00:41:39,512 --> 00:41:42,151
Sorry, I was into...
-This is not a porn movie.

303
00:41:42,352 --> 00:41:45,549
I understand, but it was just
a passionate kiss.

304
00:41:47,712 --> 00:41:50,351
When I read the script...

305
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:53,828
Did you read it?
-A few times even.

306
00:41:55,072 --> 00:41:59,190
Do you want to do it again?
-lf differently, yes.

307
00:41:59,392 --> 00:42:02,464
Kissing, but no tonguing.
That looks better.

308
00:42:04,432 --> 00:42:10,029
Unless you want to.
-That's okay.

309
00:43:37,872 --> 00:43:40,227
Could I fall in love with you?

310
00:44:49,912 --> 00:44:53,621
I'm not going to...

311
00:44:53,832 --> 00:44:55,504
No, sorry.

312
00:44:58,232 --> 00:44:59,665
Nice house.

313
00:46:25,832 --> 00:46:30,542
Sorry, I didn't know it was you.
Please don't take it personally.

314
00:46:30,752 --> 00:46:34,791
Too bad... It's just a movie, Dirk.
You're only acting.

315
00:46:34,992 --> 00:46:37,460
I was sleeping.
I didn't know it was her.

316
00:46:37,672 --> 00:46:40,311
Even better.
'Dirk' didn't know either.

317
00:46:40,512 --> 00:46:44,346
I am Dirk, Martin. You should
tell me these things beforehand.

318
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:47,828
In real life you don't know
how things end up either.

319
00:46:48,032 --> 00:46:51,069
Fine. It failed.
We'll do it as we wrote it.

320
00:46:51,272 --> 00:46:54,389
It's sick,
the way you treat your girlfriend.

321
00:46:54,592 --> 00:46:56,344
Pardon me?

322
00:46:58,632 --> 00:47:04,821
All those weird sex things you make
her do: you treat her like some whore.

323
00:47:05,032 --> 00:47:08,229
Don't you see
this it's hard for her too?

324
00:47:08,432 --> 00:47:11,310
Right?
-It's okay.

325
00:47:11,512 --> 00:47:14,629
It's not. You don't have to do this.
You're not like this.

326
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,824
Don't think a simple
grip like you...

327
00:47:18,032 --> 00:47:21,502
...can understand someone
as complex as Simone.

328
00:47:21,712 --> 00:47:25,022
As if you know everything...
mister hotshot director.

329
00:47:25,232 --> 00:47:28,429
There you are: this awkwardness is
what I need.

330
00:47:31,272 --> 00:47:36,107
Is the camera still running?
-Did you say 'cut'?

331
00:47:36,312 --> 00:47:39,190
Now then: cut. Okay?

332
00:47:40,552 --> 00:47:42,349
Is it turned off?
-Almost.

333
00:47:42,552 --> 00:47:45,862
What is this, guys?
Are we shooting a film, or what?

334
00:47:46,072 --> 00:47:49,621
Good. Thank you.
Thank you for your cooperation.

335
00:48:26,272 --> 00:48:27,625
Anyone there?

336
00:48:30,912 --> 00:48:32,789
What? Who?

337
00:48:34,272 --> 00:48:37,947
She's sleeping.
Can I take a message?

338
00:48:40,072 --> 00:48:43,826
You may want to talk to her,
but you can't. She can't speak.

339
00:48:44,032 --> 00:48:46,307
Then why does she have a phone?

340
00:48:48,672 --> 00:48:52,221
Good point.
-Could I ask you some questions then?

341
00:48:52,432 --> 00:48:56,664
I'm not going to participate
in a survey at 1 a.m.

342
00:48:56,872 --> 00:48:59,784
Haven't I spoken to you before?
-Me?

343
00:49:01,512 --> 00:49:04,470
No.
-I did. I recognize your voice.

344
00:49:04,672 --> 00:49:10,269
Is it that special?
-You were mean to hang up on me.

345
00:49:10,472 --> 00:49:15,262
That wasn't very kind.
-I didn't mean to be unkind...

346
00:49:15,472 --> 00:49:16,825
Look behind you.

347
00:49:19,232 --> 00:49:20,585
Jesus.

348
00:49:27,152 --> 00:49:32,704
You probably want to go now,
but I hope you'll stay.

349
00:49:34,192 --> 00:49:39,664
You pretended you couldn't talk?
-Yes. But I can't anymore.

350
00:49:39,872 --> 00:49:44,468
I want to show you my real self.
-You don't have to.

351
00:49:46,672 --> 00:49:49,061
I always knew you were different.

352
00:49:50,392 --> 00:49:54,670
From the moment I saw you
in the bathroom mirror.

353
00:49:55,712 --> 00:49:58,909
You mean in the restaurant?
-No, here in the bathroom.

354
00:49:59,112 --> 00:50:03,503
No, you mean...
-Right. In the restaurant.

355
00:50:03,712 --> 00:50:08,342
From the kitchen,
by way of the mirror...

356
00:50:11,192 --> 00:50:16,061
You were always sitting there
with food, wine.

357
00:50:45,872 --> 00:50:48,545
And cut. Thanks.
Very nice.

358
00:51:05,512 --> 00:51:07,707
And... you wake up now.

359
00:51:09,792 --> 00:51:13,831
It's been a long night.
A lot of things happened.

360
00:51:14,032 --> 00:51:18,025
Look, who's that?
You don't know her.

361
00:51:18,232 --> 00:51:24,148
You feel bad and guilty about
what happened. How could you do this?

362
00:51:24,352 --> 00:51:27,389
No kiss.
That's history.

363
00:51:27,592 --> 00:51:32,143
You feel...no.
You're leaving and you think...

364
00:51:32,352 --> 00:51:36,504
I don't want him to.
-Simone, you're just sleeping.

365
00:51:36,712 --> 00:51:38,509
Rolling.

366
00:51:38,712 --> 00:51:41,180
This time you leave. Go!

367
00:51:41,392 --> 00:51:44,828
You're guilty. You feel bad. Scram.
-A kiss.

368
00:51:51,312 --> 00:51:55,021
Stupid cow.
You're ruining my film.

369
00:51:55,232 --> 00:52:01,990
I think Dirk's right.
-Listen, he has to feel guilty.

370
00:52:02,192 --> 00:52:06,310
The glow is gone.
He feels bad about himself.

371
00:52:06,512 --> 00:52:10,141
But I feel great.
-Not you. Him, idiot.

372
00:52:10,352 --> 00:52:12,468
In real life we'd fuck like crazy.

373
00:52:12,672 --> 00:52:16,460
Like any couple that just met.
-That's what I'm saying.

374
00:52:16,672 --> 00:52:20,187
Where's my script?
-Right here.

375
00:52:21,832 --> 00:52:26,110
Take a five-minute break,
because you're stressed out.

376
00:52:54,232 --> 00:52:57,861
No reason.
Because I'm happy.

377
00:52:59,432 --> 00:53:00,785
Thank you.

378
00:53:31,752 --> 00:53:37,065
Didn't you think sex was overrated?
-That was before I met you.

379
00:54:36,512 --> 00:54:38,343
What are you doing here?

380
00:54:38,952 --> 00:54:43,343
I hadn't seen you for a while.
I wondered how you were.

381
00:54:48,872 --> 00:54:54,071
So you just sneak in unasked?
-You left these.

382
00:54:54,272 --> 00:54:58,902
So I considered that to be
an open invitation.

383
00:54:59,952 --> 00:55:03,740
Judging by my mail,
you haven't been by for a while.

384
00:55:03,952 --> 00:55:06,420
But you've been busy, I see.

385
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:13,541
Hi, I'm Milan, Simone's boyfriend.
-Dirk. Nice to meet you.

386
00:55:13,752 --> 00:55:16,425
He's polite.
That's to his credit.

387
00:55:19,432 --> 00:55:22,504
You have to ask these things first.

388
00:55:22,712 --> 00:55:26,102
Do I need your permission
to kiss my girlfriend?

389
00:55:26,312 --> 00:55:28,109
No, hers.

390
00:55:29,432 --> 00:55:33,266
He's emancipated. It's getting
better and better, guys.

391
00:55:33,472 --> 00:55:36,623
You're sick.
-Undoubtedly.

392
00:55:36,832 --> 00:55:39,824
But tell me:
what are you going to do?

393
00:55:42,192 --> 00:55:47,266
I'm out.
-Weakling. Giving up already?

394
00:55:49,552 --> 00:55:52,942
In real life you don't get away
with those games of yours.

395
00:55:54,432 --> 00:55:56,388
What are you talking about?

396
00:55:57,472 --> 00:56:02,705
I told him he's free to go.
-Does that mean what I think it does?

397
00:56:04,712 --> 00:56:07,431
I leave that up to you.

398
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:13,664
You heard her. Get lost.
-Take it easy, little clown.

399
00:56:13,872 --> 00:56:15,225
Good catch.

400
00:56:17,352 --> 00:56:20,901
You were hard to reach,
so answer the phone next time.

401
00:56:21,112 --> 00:56:22,830
That's up to her.

402
00:56:48,472 --> 00:56:52,385
Tough case, that guy.
-You got that right.

403
00:56:54,352 --> 00:56:56,582
I'm a lot easier.

404
00:57:03,472 --> 00:57:07,863
Is he really your boyfriend?
-He was.

405
00:57:10,192 --> 00:57:11,784
Do you still love him?

406
00:57:14,712 --> 00:57:17,704
I did. But...

407
00:57:19,312 --> 00:57:21,507
But now I just feel...

408
00:57:23,312 --> 00:57:26,110
A...
-A?

409
00:57:26,712 --> 00:57:32,821
A hard dick against my ass.
-Damn it, Simone. Really.

410
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:37,981
Stop behaving like you're in highschool.
Please stick to the script.

411
00:57:38,192 --> 00:57:41,901
Shouldn't you be out in the rain,
looking pathetic?

412
00:57:42,112 --> 00:57:45,263
Or should I throw you out again, 'Milan'?

413
00:58:46,352 --> 00:58:53,030
Why did you come barging in like that?
-I had to know what he meant to you.

414
00:58:54,272 --> 00:58:55,625
And?

415
00:58:59,552 --> 00:59:01,383
I missed you so much.

416
00:59:03,152 --> 00:59:06,781
If you only knew how tough this is
for me. For you too.

417
00:59:07,992 --> 00:59:11,780
It's good that it's tough
and that we're doing this.

418
00:59:11,992 --> 00:59:16,463
It's good, because it's tough.
-Stop it.

419
00:59:16,672 --> 00:59:19,823
Are you trying to make me jealous?
-It's not that.

420
00:59:20,032 --> 00:59:24,264
I can understand you want
to make me jealous. That's fine.

421
00:59:24,472 --> 00:59:27,464
But we shouldn't quit.
-I'm done.

422
00:59:27,672 --> 00:59:30,744
So let's start all over.
-I can't go back.

423
00:59:30,952 --> 00:59:32,510
Of course we can go back.

424
00:59:34,512 --> 00:59:38,790
You're out of luck, because I met
Dirk. He's different.

425
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:44,112
He's real. You don't always
need to play games.

426
00:59:46,832 --> 00:59:48,868
Why did you phone me?

427
00:59:51,312 --> 00:59:53,826
I love you.
-Words.

428
00:59:56,072 --> 01:00:01,624
But beautiful words.
-Very beautiful. Bye.

429
01:00:04,512 --> 01:00:07,265
Cut.
Endboard.

430
01:00:26,832 --> 01:00:30,142
Mister lover lover. How was it?

431
01:00:31,192 --> 01:00:34,389
Come on. How is she?
Does she taste good?

432
01:00:34,592 --> 01:00:37,868
I'm not going to...

433
01:00:38,072 --> 01:00:41,542
I'm glad you're here.
So you can train your new assistant.

434
01:00:41,752 --> 01:00:45,745
I have an assistant?
-Yes. An assistant kitchen assistant.

435
01:00:47,232 --> 01:00:48,904
Hi, I'm Milan.

436
01:00:49,112 --> 01:00:52,422
Since you walked off duty
for some 'hubba-hubba'...

437
01:00:52,632 --> 01:00:54,304
With or without?

438
01:00:55,552 --> 01:00:56,905
I'll go without.

439
01:01:05,592 --> 01:01:06,945
And cut.

440
01:01:11,232 --> 01:01:14,144
You're a natural.
-Thank you, chef.

441
01:01:14,352 --> 01:01:17,788
I'm going to like it here, I think.

442
01:01:17,992 --> 01:01:21,701
Sorry, Milan. Would you be so kind
and clean that up?

443
01:01:21,912 --> 01:01:25,825
Of course, mister Dirk.
If I can be of service to you.

444
01:01:28,312 --> 01:01:30,667
One has to start at the bottom.

445
01:01:35,432 --> 01:01:40,187
Stop. Good take...
Mark, could you clean up this mess?

446
01:01:51,632 --> 01:01:52,985
Boss...

447
01:01:54,112 --> 01:01:56,387
I put it on again.

448
01:01:56,592 --> 01:02:00,824
I hear you're dating a dumbo.
-She's not a dumbo.

449
01:02:01,032 --> 01:02:02,545
No, she's dumb.

450
01:02:03,832 --> 01:02:06,869
And I hear she's gorgeous.

451
01:02:08,152 --> 01:02:10,541
She just has a bad taste in men.

452
01:02:11,912 --> 01:02:16,269
Funny for you to say.
Since you're dating.

453
01:02:16,472 --> 01:02:20,545
Actually I meant her ex.
He's a strange guy.

454
01:02:20,752 --> 01:02:23,983
Did you meet him?
-Unfortunately, yes.

455
01:02:24,192 --> 01:02:27,184
That must have been awkward.
Was he jealous?

456
01:02:27,392 --> 01:02:31,704
I don't know. Not my problem.
-lt can become a nuisance.

457
01:02:31,912 --> 01:02:35,700
A stalking ex on your tail.
-I'm not worried.

458
01:02:35,912 --> 01:02:38,346
He was a sad case.

459
01:02:40,872 --> 01:02:45,423
But are you sure he's her ex?
Maybe they still have a relationship.

460
01:02:45,632 --> 01:02:48,942
No, she really likes me.
-How can you be sure?

461
01:02:49,152 --> 01:02:51,541
Maybe she's playing some weird game.

462
01:02:52,272 --> 01:02:55,025
Then you wouldn't be making
a fool of yourself, 'Milan'.

463
01:02:55,232 --> 01:02:56,824
On the contrary, Dirk.

464
01:02:57,952 --> 01:03:00,864
This one's fine for me.
-And cut.

465
01:03:05,192 --> 01:03:07,308
Hey, girl.

466
01:03:14,672 --> 01:03:17,061
What a pleasant surprise.

467
01:03:18,352 --> 01:03:22,425
Do you know each other?
-Will you tell them or should l?

468
01:03:22,632 --> 01:03:25,669
Stop it.
You know she can't talk.

469
01:03:28,592 --> 01:03:30,662
Don't mind Milan, honey.

470
01:03:46,592 --> 01:03:47,945
Do you want a drink?

471
01:03:48,152 --> 01:03:50,143
Are you thirsty?
-Not really.

472
01:03:50,352 --> 01:03:51,910
He's fine.

473
01:03:53,632 --> 01:03:54,985
Did you see that?

474
01:03:56,512 --> 01:04:00,903
She's not a dumbo.
-I keep saying it's 'dumb.'

475
01:04:01,112 --> 01:04:05,264
She's been acting all along.
What a bitch.

476
01:04:05,472 --> 01:04:08,544
They seemed such a nice couple.
-lncredible.

477
01:04:08,752 --> 01:04:11,346
I thought he only cared
about his wife.

478
01:04:12,392 --> 01:04:16,465
His wife?
-Yes. His wife.

479
01:04:16,672 --> 01:04:19,823
He got himself a girlfriend
to get his wife back.

480
01:04:20,032 --> 01:04:22,990
Or so I thought.
-ls he married?

481
01:04:26,672 --> 01:04:29,744
Tjaltje says: 'lt only works
if you're in love.'

482
01:04:29,952 --> 01:04:33,547
Why are you hanging out with Tjaltje?
-She's sensitive.

483
01:04:33,752 --> 01:04:37,904
She makes those sensitive sounds.
-Hiccups are normal.

484
01:04:39,272 --> 01:04:43,470
This is Martin Zomer calling
from the set of 'Real Life.'

485
01:04:43,672 --> 01:04:47,062
I'd like to ask you
if the children are there.

486
01:04:55,792 --> 01:04:57,828
Anything else?
-No, thank you.

487
01:04:58,032 --> 01:05:02,662
Don't you recognize me?
-Not really. No idea.

488
01:05:02,872 --> 01:05:07,741
I'm your wife. Clarisse.
And you are?

489
01:05:13,592 --> 01:05:14,991
You have a wife?

490
01:05:16,712 --> 01:05:19,021
Do you have a wife?
-Apparently.

491
01:05:21,512 --> 01:05:23,343
She says so.

492
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:26,624
Bad casting...
-You two look terrible together.

493
01:05:26,832 --> 01:05:30,905
I agree.
Can't you play my wife?

494
01:05:31,272 --> 01:05:33,706
I never drink beer actually.
-Me neither.

495
01:05:33,912 --> 01:05:35,265
BAD LlVER

496
01:05:35,472 --> 01:05:37,463
Kiss her again, Dirk.

497
01:05:41,912 --> 01:05:44,472
And...action.

498
01:05:46,872 --> 01:05:49,261
Do you recognize these two?
-Sweethearts.

499
01:05:49,472 --> 01:05:55,069
Were you really kissing her?
-Just for the film. Come on.

500
01:05:58,832 --> 01:06:02,711
Listen up. I don't give a shit about
what you do to me...

501
01:06:02,912 --> 01:06:05,904
but keep your filthy hands
off my kids.

502
01:06:06,112 --> 01:06:10,071
It's not my fault your wife brought
the kids. Insert on his face.

503
01:06:10,272 --> 01:06:15,790
I'll insert your face somewhere, Martin.
-Milan, the name's Milan. I know it's difficult.

504
01:06:17,512 --> 01:06:22,905
Let's not forget it was your idea
to give the kids a cameo role.

505
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:27,788
They only had to sleep, asshole.
This was very different.

506
01:06:27,992 --> 01:06:34,101
Yes, like you were only supposed to act
that you'd steal Simone from me.

507
01:06:35,552 --> 01:06:37,144
Why don't you hit me?

508
01:06:39,552 --> 01:06:41,941
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

509
01:06:45,632 --> 01:06:48,305
I'm leaving.
Are you coming?

510
01:06:49,592 --> 01:06:50,627
No.

511
01:07:06,712 --> 01:07:10,341
That was very good, but I'd still
like to do it again.

512
01:07:10,552 --> 01:07:14,784
Get lost with your stupid film.
-You sit down in your trailer.

513
01:07:14,992 --> 01:07:19,144
Someone get my script in order.
We'll gladly do it again.

514
01:07:19,352 --> 01:07:25,348
That was good.
Take a two-minute break.

515
01:08:00,432 --> 01:08:02,787
I owe you my thanks.

516
01:08:07,512 --> 01:08:11,505
You taught me not to be afraid
of my feelings.

517
01:08:11,712 --> 01:08:13,065
You're welcome.

518
01:08:14,672 --> 01:08:17,709
Your example gave me
the courage I needed.

519
01:08:28,592 --> 01:08:30,708
Were you expecting someone else?

520
01:08:34,112 --> 01:08:36,262
Can I come in, or...?

521
01:08:47,272 --> 01:08:48,671
Sweetie.

522
01:08:51,352 --> 01:08:53,263
Shouldn't you be with your wife?

523
01:08:55,512 --> 01:08:59,141
That wasn't my wife,
it was an actress...

524
01:08:59,352 --> 01:09:03,903
Clarisse is Surinamese.
-You lied to me.

525
01:09:04,992 --> 01:09:06,584
You used me.

526
01:09:11,832 --> 01:09:16,906
I thought I'd found someone
who was honest and real.

527
01:09:17,112 --> 01:09:21,071
Like your boyfriend with my kids.
-Clarisse did that.

528
01:09:23,272 --> 01:09:25,911
Are you two playing games with me?

529
01:09:26,112 --> 01:09:30,469
The grip gets to fool around with
the gorgeous girl and then gets dumped?

530
01:09:32,032 --> 01:09:34,466
Kitchen assistent.
-What?

531
01:09:34,672 --> 01:09:37,106
Kitchen assistent.
You said 'grip.'

532
01:09:37,312 --> 01:09:40,110
Okay.
Kitchen assistent.

533
01:09:40,312 --> 01:09:41,745
Sweetie.

534
01:10:03,432 --> 01:10:08,506
You were right... Dirk is just as
much of a lowlife as you are.

535
01:10:08,712 --> 01:10:10,350
So?

536
01:10:12,032 --> 01:10:16,503
Can't we start over?
-I thought that wasn't possible.

537
01:10:22,392 --> 01:10:23,745
It is.

538
01:10:29,592 --> 01:10:33,426
I was wrong. I'm sorry.
-Right. You're sorry.

539
01:10:33,632 --> 01:10:37,102
And now the last line:
'l love you. Really.'

540
01:10:37,312 --> 01:10:40,543
Easy to say when he's awaiting you.
-He's gone.

541
01:10:40,752 --> 01:10:43,630
Is he?
-Yes.

542
01:10:43,832 --> 01:10:49,190
Is he really? And here?
Is he gone here as well?

543
01:10:49,392 --> 01:10:52,350
How can I be sure?

544
01:10:52,552 --> 01:10:58,502
I have to say this:
You created it, you solve it.

545
01:10:58,712 --> 01:11:03,502
What do you want me to do?
-I want you...

546
01:11:05,032 --> 01:11:07,387
to do to him...

547
01:11:08,952 --> 01:11:12,228
what you should have done
in the first place.

548
01:11:17,952 --> 01:11:19,988
Tomorrow.

549
01:11:20,192 --> 01:11:23,104
And in my presence.
-I promise.

550
01:11:26,752 --> 01:11:31,348
Tomorrow I'll break up with him.
In The Bar.

551
01:11:31,552 --> 01:11:33,827
So you can watch.

552
01:11:36,632 --> 01:11:39,669
Then you can't kiss me
until tomorrow.

553
01:11:39,872 --> 01:11:43,581
You're sick.
-You're beautiful.

554
01:11:43,792 --> 01:11:45,191
Beautifully sick.

555
01:11:52,352 --> 01:11:53,831
And cut.

556
01:12:20,512 --> 01:12:24,141
Research into the emotional life
of the Dutch...

557
01:12:24,352 --> 01:12:29,142
have proven not to be accurate.
Therefore, we need further data.

558
01:12:29,352 --> 01:12:33,630
Could you please tell me if you
believe in love at first sight?

559
01:12:34,712 --> 01:12:38,227
Pardon me?
-I believe in love at first sight.

560
01:12:40,032 --> 01:12:42,387
I have no more questions.
Goodbye.

561
01:12:45,512 --> 01:12:48,902
What are you doing here?
-I have to tell you something.

562
01:12:51,352 --> 01:12:56,949
I'm working now. I'll meet you later,
for a drink at The Bar.

563
01:12:57,152 --> 01:12:58,505
I'm busy.

564
01:12:58,712 --> 01:13:02,102
This is the most important thing
I've ever said to anyone.

565
01:13:02,312 --> 01:13:05,861
Don't be silly.
-Do you recognize this?

566
01:13:07,152 --> 01:13:10,224
Give it to me.
-When you've found someone...

567
01:13:10,432 --> 01:13:12,582
you really love,
you have to choose.

568
01:13:12,792 --> 01:13:15,829
Only then will I know what we
truly mean to each other.

569
01:13:17,272 --> 01:13:21,151
How could you do this?
I may have lied about my wife...

570
01:13:21,352 --> 01:13:28,064
but what you did is just as bad.
And Milan is even worse.

571
01:13:28,272 --> 01:13:31,548
If he dares to ask
something like that...

572
01:13:31,752 --> 01:13:34,983
he not only doesn't respect you...

573
01:13:36,352 --> 01:13:40,823
he simply doesn't love you.
This letter proves it. Treasure it.

574
01:13:46,832 --> 01:13:48,185
I...

575
01:13:54,792 --> 01:13:58,501
I wish you...
-Lots of luck in life.

576
01:14:01,712 --> 01:14:05,864
Lots of luck
with the rest of your...

577
01:14:07,672 --> 01:14:10,584
with the rest...
There's one more thing.

578
01:14:11,632 --> 01:14:15,989
Before I leave, I want to say that
these past few weeks have been...

579
01:14:17,032 --> 01:14:19,023
the most beautiful
of my life.

580
01:14:20,352 --> 01:14:24,584
I'd like to thank you for that.
-You're welcome.

581
01:14:25,712 --> 01:14:30,263
I see so much love
in your eyes.

582
01:14:30,472 --> 01:14:33,748
I'm so proud someone like you
likes me.

583
01:14:33,952 --> 01:14:35,670
I have to go.
-Wait.

584
01:14:35,872 --> 01:14:38,591
Let me go.
-I just don't get it.

585
01:14:38,792 --> 01:14:43,024
Remember what you said in the hotel?
Remember?

586
01:14:43,232 --> 01:14:46,065
That you could be
yourself with me.

587
01:14:46,272 --> 01:14:50,424
I don't want you, get it?
-You even wanted to take the kids...

588
01:14:50,632 --> 01:14:53,783
to an amusement park
to get to know them.

589
01:14:53,992 --> 01:14:57,462
Stop it.
It was my job.

590
01:14:57,672 --> 01:14:59,663
I did it for the film.

591
01:15:02,272 --> 01:15:08,950
You were so very shy. I had to do
something to loosen you up.

592
01:15:09,152 --> 01:15:11,382
We're not a good fit.

593
01:15:12,792 --> 01:15:14,623
Don't you see that?

594
01:15:16,152 --> 01:15:18,950
No, I don't.

595
01:15:29,512 --> 01:15:30,865
Action.

596
01:15:51,432 --> 01:15:54,071
Jesus... Milan.

597
01:15:55,192 --> 01:15:59,344
I thought you'd gone home.
-Would you have preferred that?

598
01:15:59,552 --> 01:16:01,031
Of course not.

599
01:16:02,232 --> 01:16:06,111
What's wrong?
Why aren't you in bed?

600
01:16:06,312 --> 01:16:09,827
Why do you think?
I can't sleep.

601
01:16:11,272 --> 01:16:16,346
I've had that strange woman
in my head all day. Woman. Girl.

602
01:16:17,792 --> 01:16:20,260
A girl who apparently spends nights...

603
01:16:20,472 --> 01:16:24,943
in a hotel with a stranger
talking about his kids...

604
01:16:25,152 --> 01:16:28,667
and amusement parks.
-What are you doing?

605
01:16:33,992 --> 01:16:35,948
I love you, Simone.

606
01:16:37,272 --> 01:16:40,184
I love you.
-Sweetheart.

607
01:16:42,672 --> 01:16:44,788
What's wrong?

608
01:16:46,912 --> 01:16:50,188
You cheated on me before my own eyes.

609
01:16:51,432 --> 01:16:56,381
You gave yourself so easily to him.

610
01:16:56,592 --> 01:17:02,303
As if it didn't cost you any effort.
-That's because I knew it was you.

611
01:17:02,512 --> 01:17:06,391
Yeah, right. Dirk and l
really resemble each other.

612
01:17:06,592 --> 01:17:08,822
Jesus Christ.

613
01:17:12,032 --> 01:17:15,422
Shit. Damn it.

614
01:17:15,632 --> 01:17:19,910
Yes, and what do we do now?
You and your deadpan expression.

615
01:17:20,112 --> 01:17:25,345
Damn it. Were you this invulnerable
and aloof with Dirk as well?

616
01:17:25,552 --> 01:17:29,670
A total blank
so it seems real.

617
01:17:31,792 --> 01:17:34,511
You're such a...
Camera on her.

618
01:17:35,552 --> 01:17:37,827
Do what you have to do to seem sweet.

619
01:17:38,032 --> 01:17:40,546
You're such a great faker.
-So are you.

620
01:17:40,752 --> 01:17:45,462
With you everything could be fake.
-But it isn't.

621
01:17:46,512 --> 01:17:50,551
You know I love you.
-You'd say the same to him.

622
01:17:50,752 --> 01:17:54,711
As I'm doing now, right?
You are him.

623
01:17:56,152 --> 01:18:03,228
You are my one and only true love.

624
01:18:08,592 --> 01:18:11,470
Words.
-But beautiful words.

625
01:18:11,672 --> 01:18:14,709
Yes, beautiful...
This is bullshit, guys.

626
01:18:17,672 --> 01:18:20,232
Damn it.
-Martin.

627
01:18:20,432 --> 01:18:23,310
My name is Milan.

628
01:18:23,512 --> 01:18:27,061
Finish the scene.
-I forgot.

629
01:18:32,552 --> 01:18:34,986
But beautiful words.

630
01:18:35,192 --> 01:18:40,789
Yes. But right now I don't know
what those words mean.

631
01:18:42,272 --> 01:18:47,107
They mean I love you... I'm certain.

632
01:19:01,312 --> 01:19:05,749
How does it feel
to outsmart everyone?

633
01:19:07,832 --> 01:19:10,471
Keep going.
You're almost there.

634
01:19:13,672 --> 01:19:16,186
Don't you understand
for who I did all this?

635
01:19:16,392 --> 01:19:18,223
Not for me, in any case.

636
01:19:20,512 --> 01:19:22,070
Is that what you think?

637
01:19:30,432 --> 01:19:31,945
Martin, come.

638
01:19:33,392 --> 01:19:35,064
Come here for a minute.

639
01:19:38,592 --> 01:19:40,662
Please.

640
01:19:54,192 --> 01:19:55,830
What did you do?

641
01:19:59,432 --> 01:20:01,263
What did you do?

642
01:20:06,352 --> 01:20:08,991
I still had some scenes with him.

643
01:20:19,432 --> 01:20:21,388
You've got all you need now?

644
01:20:28,192 --> 01:20:29,671
I think so.
