1
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:13,304
...and don't pack too tight.

2
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,316
The side pockets of the suitcase
are very good for small objects. ;

3
00:00:17,384 --> 00:00:20,353
Earrings, chewing gum, shoe polish...

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,787
needle and thread, charm bracelets,
things like that.

5
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:27,483
The top pocket is very good for hair rollers.

6
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:30,927
Since they are plastic,
they do not pull the lid down.

7
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:34,297
Also, so your shampoo
and cosmetics don't spill...

8
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:37,234
put all your gooey things in a plastic bag.

9
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:39,533
I call it my Icky Bag.

10
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:42,873
Today's wonderful miracle
permanent-press fabrics...

11
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:45,604
are a big help
for the young girl on the move.

12
00:00:45,678 --> 00:00:48,078
But for that very special wool jacket...

13
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:51,447
there's still good old tissue paper
to help keep out nasty creases.

14
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:54,582
You won't need tissue for all garments...

15
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:58,784
but you will need common sense
to keep the case from looking sloppy.

16
00:00:58,958 --> 00:01:01,188
And one final tip, girls.

17
00:01:01,728 --> 00:01:06,256
Pack your naughtiest nightie right on top,
in case you need it in a hurry.

18
00:01:06,566 --> 00:01:08,295
Packing a suitcase?

19
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:11,394
What the hell kind of talent is that?
I can pack a suitcase.

20
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,463
It's the only thing she could do
without falling off the stage.

21
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:17,567
She is cute. I kind of liked the nightie joke.

22
00:01:18,378 --> 00:01:22,439
That's just the kind of stuff they hate
at the finals. They're not looking for sex.

23
00:01:22,515 --> 00:01:24,608
Everybody's looking for sex.

24
00:01:25,652 --> 00:01:27,017
Thank you.

25
00:01:28,588 --> 00:01:33,048
And now the winner to represent
the lmperial County in the State Finals...

26
00:01:33,126 --> 00:01:35,959
the winner from El Centro:
Connie Thompson.

27
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:50,406
Thank you.

28
00:01:51,744 --> 00:01:55,202
An all-American girl you see

29
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:58,011
She's all an American girl should be

30
00:02:04,457 --> 00:02:07,324
She wears a crown with love and respect

31
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,861
She's a young American girl

32
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:14,423
Smile.

33
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,195
Girls! Now, there are only
two things to remember.

34
00:05:30,530 --> 00:05:33,931
Just be yourselves, and keep smiling!

35
00:05:41,207 --> 00:05:42,333
Hello, girls.

36
00:05:42,408 --> 00:05:44,433
My name is Mr. Wilson Shears...

37
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:48,537
and I am the President of this year's
Young American Miss Pageant.

38
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:52,414
I know you all must be kind of pooped,
but I do have a couple of announcements.

39
00:05:52,485 --> 00:05:55,579
First, as regards your luggage.

40
00:05:56,222 --> 00:05:59,191
Your luggage will be arriving in the lobby.

41
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:06,130
Some of your luggage will be arriving.

42
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:08,565
Seems there's been a mix-up at the airport.

43
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,864
Girls, keep smiling.

44
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:14,200
We'll have all of your luggage
delivered to your host parent's home.

45
00:06:14,273 --> 00:06:15,740
Yes, we will.

46
00:06:16,008 --> 00:06:19,068
Now, I have one further announcement...

47
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:24,242
from the Veterans War Memorial Auditorium
Maintenance Director and his staff.

48
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,609
That's me and you, Logan.

49
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:32,013
"It is requested that the girls do not dispose
of their sanitary napkins in the commodes.

50
00:06:33,092 --> 00:06:36,118
"Since there are so many girls in the hall...

51
00:06:36,462 --> 00:06:40,193
"and since a sanitary napkin
is thick and difficult..."

52
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,735
Well, just don't do it.

53
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:48,330
Now, I'd like to turn things over...

54
00:06:48,941 --> 00:06:52,342
to someone I'm sure you all know,
Miss Brenda DiCarlo...

55
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:57,145
who is the supervisor of this year's pageant
and a former Young American Miss.

56
00:06:58,484 --> 00:07:01,976
...his breathing rate is approximately
1 2 times a minute for adults.

57
00:07:02,321 --> 00:07:05,552
Now, if you'll just follow me
and the Mother Hens...

58
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:09,891
Do you think the announcement
about the toilets will help, Mr. Nakas?

59
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:14,724
I'm so sorry I forgot to tell you
about Mr. French's phone call.

60
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:17,065
- That's all right, dear.
- This is all so new to me.

61
00:07:17,136 --> 00:07:19,627
- Just being out of the house is new to me.
- Here.

62
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:22,230
Brenda, you're so organized and everything.

63
00:07:22,308 --> 00:07:23,900
- How do you do it?
- I don't know.

64
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:27,571
I get tired but I just keep going.
Somebody has to do the job.

65
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:31,083
Girls, you're now in No Man's Land.

66
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:34,085
It's called that for obvious reasons.
Everyone come in.

67
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,314
You're gonna be spending
a lot of time in here...

68
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,289
so get familiar with it and find your coop.

69
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,517
Now, your coop is run by your Mother Hen.

70
00:07:41,594 --> 00:07:45,257
You'll see three girls.
Janet, would you turn the board around?

71
00:07:45,331 --> 00:07:48,198
On the board you're going to see
three color groups.

72
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:50,167
Simi Valley. I'm Maria Gonzales.

73
00:07:50,236 --> 00:07:52,796
I forget your name,
but I see your name in the paper...

74
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:53,930
Karen.

75
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:57,100
Well, we're roommates.
So I come up and say hello to you.

76
00:07:57,176 --> 00:08:00,407
- Nice to meet you.
- I have to go sing. I see you later.

77
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,540
And I want to see all the other girls
finding their Mother Hens.

78
00:08:03,616 --> 00:08:06,312
Okay, blues. Whoever's a blue.

79
00:08:06,853 --> 00:08:10,516
All right. You're blue? Yes, right.
Of course, I remember you.

80
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:15,024
All right, every blue here.
We're gonna learn the opening song...

81
00:08:15,094 --> 00:08:18,962
which is here on the board.
And nobody's being judged here, okay?

82
00:08:19,031 --> 00:08:22,296
Ready to start out, singing our hearts out

83
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:25,735
Robin Gibson, right?
Hi, I'm Doria. We're roommates.

84
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,296
Built by youth you'll see today

85
00:08:28,841 --> 00:08:32,470
- I'm supposed to learn this song with them.
- Sure, I'll see you later, okay?

86
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:35,078
Good, that's not bad at all.

87
00:08:35,147 --> 00:08:38,139
Let's start just from there again.
Let's take it from the top.

88
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:49,250
If you love the open road as much as I do,
Tone, my guy right here, that's the one.

89
00:08:49,328 --> 00:08:53,264
If you're worried about credit, forget it.
We don't worry about it, why should you?

90
00:08:53,332 --> 00:08:56,768
Hey, Brenda! How are you?
Be with you in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

91
00:08:56,836 --> 00:08:58,133
Go in and park your carcass.

92
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:01,640
Tony, this beauty here
holds 50 gallons of gasoline.

93
00:09:01,908 --> 00:09:03,500
Now what does Uncle Sam say to us?

94
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:07,512
He says, "Don't store gasoline."
We all agree with that, don't we?

95
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:11,209
But with all these crazy Arabs around,
who knows what they're gonna do next?

96
00:09:11,284 --> 00:09:13,479
You have to admit
it's a safe feeling knowing...

97
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,215
you're sleeping on top of 50 gallons of gas.

98
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,751
Well, we'll have to think that over.

99
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:21,054
Thinking, that's what this game is all about.

100
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:24,221
You must think it over, Tony.
I'm gonna give you one of my cards.

101
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:28,131
That's my home phone number on there.
Call me 365 days a year.

102
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:32,165
All of Big Bob Freelander's customers
are also his friends.

103
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,036
How about that? A balloon for Mom.

104
00:09:36,108 --> 00:09:40,545
You think it over, and I'd say
you got an early October here, right?

105
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,907
Okay, the three of you think it over.

106
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:44,574
Leonard, line 2.

107
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,886
- Sorry to keep you waiting, Brenda.
- That's fine.

108
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:52,618
- Are those the applications?
- Yes, indeed. Thirty-three this year.

109
00:09:52,692 --> 00:09:55,820
Really? Six more than last year? Wow!

110
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,624
And we got San Diego.

111
00:09:57,697 --> 00:10:01,224
- You are doing a bang-up job, Brenda.
- Thank you.

112
00:10:01,734 --> 00:10:04,567
- Any real lookers this year?
- Oh, you men.

113
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:06,636
What do you mean us men?

114
00:10:06,706 --> 00:10:10,142
You women are checking each other out
a lot more than any man I ever saw.

115
00:10:10,209 --> 00:10:13,701
You're always the first ones
to sneak a look at the centerfold of Playboy.

116
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,646
- That's not true.
- Are those the name tags?

117
00:10:18,651 --> 00:10:20,915
- Do you like it?
- Do I like it.

118
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,380
Boy, gold this year, huh?

119
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,987
No, just yours is.

120
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:30,989
The rest are only silver.

121
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,725
Brenda, thank you. That's really nice.

122
00:10:35,534 --> 00:10:38,560
Well, I've got a Jaycette meeting.
So, goodbye.

123
00:10:38,871 --> 00:10:41,704
See you tomorrow when all the action starts.

124
00:10:41,774 --> 00:10:44,242
And don't do anything I wouldn't do.

125
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,504
Don't worry.

126
00:10:45,578 --> 00:10:48,672
Say, Brenda,
where's your hubby been hiding out?

127
00:10:48,748 --> 00:10:50,875
Andy? Hiding?

128
00:10:51,017 --> 00:10:53,645
Well, I missed him
the last couple of Jaycee luncheons.

129
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:57,980
He had a touch of the flu.

130
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,684
You'd better start taking
better care of him than that.

131
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,887
He was my friend first, you know.

132
00:11:02,962 --> 00:11:04,122
Right.

133
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,828
You stole him from me.

134
00:11:11,103 --> 00:11:14,436
Hello, muffin. How's my sweetheart?

135
00:11:14,807 --> 00:11:17,002
No, darling, you can't go out.

136
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,372
I'm sorry, I'm late.

137
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:26,649
- I see you got dinner.
- Yep. Now dinner's getting me.

138
00:11:29,388 --> 00:11:32,152
Another evening of sarcasm and self-pity.

139
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:58,412
- Brenda, I'm sorry.
- I'm tired.

140
00:12:00,486 --> 00:12:02,351
Yeah, we're all tired.

141
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,003
You guys do it to me every time.

142
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,203
Somebody's been fooling
with my thermostat again.

143
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:27,643
Little Bob?

144
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:30,607
Mom!

145
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:47,931
Hey, Roberta,
have you seen my applications?

146
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:51,734
No, honey. Do you have to
work on those tonight?

147
00:12:51,804 --> 00:12:54,671
It's pageantry time. No rest for the weary.

148
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:08,580
I'll tell you what we are gonna do, though,
after this week of pageantry.

149
00:13:08,654 --> 00:13:12,613
You and I are gonna sneak off
and have us a romantic little weekend.

150
00:13:12,691 --> 00:13:16,627
- How about Little Bob?
- No, not this time. Little Bob's out.

151
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,158
Where are we going?

152
00:13:20,499 --> 00:13:22,865
I thought we'd go to Disneyland.

153
00:13:25,437 --> 00:13:29,203
- Yeah, I got my dad's application book.
- Who's the sexiest?

154
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:33,044
I can't tell.
The pictures are just faces, no bodies.

155
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,543
There's one from Simi Valley
who looks pretty good.

156
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,741
But she's sticking out
where the picture ends.

157
00:13:37,817 --> 00:13:40,342
So she's either got great tits or she's fat.

158
00:13:40,419 --> 00:13:42,546
Does she look like she's been laid?

159
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:46,421
How should I know, Chuck? They don't
write down whether or not they're virgins.

160
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,552
Don't mess this up.
There's a lot of money in it for both of us.

161
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:52,392
Quit worrying, Chuck.
I'll take care of my end.

162
00:13:52,464 --> 00:13:54,659
Now, are you sure
Freddy's got the Polaroid?

163
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:57,361
- Little Bob!
- Talk to you later, Chuck.

164
00:14:01,941 --> 00:14:04,876
Little Bob, have you seen the applications?

165
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:06,701
There they are.

166
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:10,772
Sorry, Dad, were you looking for these?
I was just reading some of them.

167
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,112
You were?

168
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:14,279
You know something, Dad?

169
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:17,811
I know I sort of put down the pageant
the last couple of years.

170
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:22,156
But after reading these applications,
I can see why you want to help these girls.

171
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:25,061
They seem very worthwhile.

172
00:14:25,731 --> 00:14:27,426
Right on, son.

173
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:33,968
These are the finest bunch
of high school girls in the state.

174
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:36,371
You want to know something else?

175
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:38,837
One of the most exciting things
about growing up:

176
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:43,314
One day, you find yourself being interested
in all sorts of new things.

177
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,375
You are tops.

178
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,014
- Can I have these now?
- Yeah.

179
00:14:52,558 --> 00:14:54,856
No rest for the weary this week.

180
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,429
- Dad?
- Yeah.

181
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,959
Are there many fat girls in the contest?

182
00:15:03,035 --> 00:15:05,026
No. Not usually.

183
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:13,576
We can see a bright tomorrow

184
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,347
Built by youth you see today

185
00:15:17,016 --> 00:15:19,985
We have faith, we have hope

186
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:22,919
We can see a brighter day

187
00:15:28,127 --> 00:15:29,594
What are you doing?

188
00:15:30,462 --> 00:15:33,329
I was just looking
at this man's shaving stuff.

189
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:36,994
Believe it or not, I've never been
in a bathroom a man uses before.

190
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:39,299
Well, I haven't, either. Hardly.

191
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,668
I didn't mean that.

192
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:45,904
I just meant that I never had a brother
or father or anything.

193
00:15:46,245 --> 00:15:48,907
- I grew up with just my mom.
- Where's your father?

194
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,846
He died when I was two.

195
00:15:51,016 --> 00:15:53,610
Wow, I'm sorry, Rob.

196
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:55,181
Don't worry about it.

197
00:15:55,254 --> 00:15:58,553
I really think it makes other people
feel worse than it does me.

198
00:15:58,624 --> 00:16:01,286
I don't even remember him. I was only two.

199
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,851
You know what?
It could help you in this contest.

200
00:16:03,929 --> 00:16:08,093
Getting to be a top high-school senior
without a father to help you.

201
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:11,465
Jesus, was that an awful thing to say?

202
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:15,405
No, I don't think so.
I mean, do you really think...

203
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:19,433
that things like having no father,
and stuff like that helps up here?

204
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:21,240
Yeah, everything counts up here.

205
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:24,749
Your grades, your personality,
the judges' conference.

206
00:16:25,117 --> 00:16:28,985
Jesus, I like it better
when they just judge your tits and ass.

207
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:31,651
- Have you been in one of those?
- Yeah.

208
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:35,387
- I won Miss Teenage Complexion.
- I don't think I've heard of that one.

209
00:16:35,461 --> 00:16:39,454
It was sponsored by this
horny old dermatologist in Orange County.

210
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:41,931
He rented a room at the Disneyland Hotel...

211
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:45,266
got 16 girls in bathing suits
and he had his own beauty contest.

212
00:16:45,337 --> 00:16:48,431
You're kidding me!
Well, didn't you get mad?

213
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,742
No. I won $200 and had a wart removed.

214
00:16:55,114 --> 00:16:58,413
I think the biggest help in my life
has been my mom.

215
00:16:59,284 --> 00:17:01,445
Well, both my parents, really.

216
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,887
Perhaps the judges' conference
is the single most important test...

217
00:17:04,957 --> 00:17:08,051
of what a Young American Miss
is really made of.

218
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:12,629
What I mean is the valuable
and the fulfillment is just helping others.

219
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:16,465
Sandra Kay, tell me what you think
about Women's Lib.

220
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,769
Well, I think it's kind of silly.

221
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,507
What I mean is, it's not so important...

222
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:29,672
Where is he?
We're supposed to start rehearsals.

223
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:34,817
This is my first year as President.
The Jaycees are counting on me.

224
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:38,414
- What if he doesn't show up?
- Don't worry, he'll be here.

225
00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,718
I don't know why we had to
go and hire this guy.

226
00:17:40,793 --> 00:17:43,819
I don't know why we couldn't have hired
the guy we had last year.

227
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,955
That homosexual from San Francisco.

228
00:17:46,031 --> 00:17:49,523
Now listen, I worked long and hard
to get Tommy French for this show.

229
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,501
It was a great coup.

230
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:53,936
He's never staged a local pageant before.

231
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:57,464
- Doesn't look like he'll stage this one.
- Don't worry.

232
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:04,314
Sandra Kay Mathic. ; Miss Louisiana!

233
00:18:04,383 --> 00:18:07,682
These scholarships are made possible
by the optimistic support...

234
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,688
of the pageant's national sponsors. ;
Clairol and Denny's.

235
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:18,287
The big show in Baton Rouge is telecast
nationally, and for the past four years...

236
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:21,560
has been conceived and directed
by Mr. Tommy French.

237
00:18:21,733 --> 00:18:25,897
Although Mr. French is famous
for his smooth professional choreography...

238
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:29,498
he impresses on each girl
that their youthful enthusiasm...

239
00:18:29,575 --> 00:18:31,600
is the main ingredient of the big show.

240
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,407
We should never have hired
a guy that expensive.

241
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,846
Expensive people are always late.

242
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:40,282
- Where the hell is he?
- Relax, I'm here.

243
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:43,387
Mr. French is the Hollywood professional...

244
00:18:43,455 --> 00:18:46,390
and choreographer of many
of your favorite television programs.

245
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,689
We know each of the girls has profited...

246
00:18:50,229 --> 00:18:52,561
I look older in person, don't I?

247
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,897
Have any of you had any dance experience?

248
00:18:58,337 --> 00:19:00,862
- Does square dancing count?
- Not with me, dear.

249
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,770
Now, ladies, first pick up the pompom.

250
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,382
One, two.

251
00:19:11,984 --> 00:19:13,178
Ready?

252
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:15,753
One, two.

253
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,421
Sensational.

254
00:19:17,689 --> 00:19:19,122
Tambourines.

255
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:23,125
One, two.

256
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,398
And one, two.

257
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,493
A real showstopper.

258
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:31,736
Bamboo poles.

259
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,771
I don't have a bamboo pole.

260
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:36,202
One, two, three, four.

261
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:38,367
Ready?

262
00:19:39,244 --> 00:19:41,644
And one, two, three...

263
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,976
Very nice. Work on it.

264
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:51,412
Well, first I do Spring is Here,
and then I do Summer Sun...

265
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:56,189
then I do the first half of Autumn Leaves,
and I finish with Winter Wonderland.

266
00:19:56,261 --> 00:19:58,661
I call it A Song for All Seasons.

267
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:02,263
Cute. Now have you got
an arrangement for all this?

268
00:20:05,304 --> 00:20:08,296
No, I just thought
you'd sort of follow along.

269
00:20:08,407 --> 00:20:11,240
Hear that, boys?
We just sort of follow along.

270
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:14,474
Okay, ready, four and...

271
00:20:15,647 --> 00:20:18,548
Spring is here!

272
00:20:18,951 --> 00:20:22,148
Why doesn't my heart go dancing?

273
00:20:27,793 --> 00:20:29,385
What's the matter?

274
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:34,858
I'm sorry. Well, I usually
do this to my own tape...

275
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:39,261
and live music sounds
a lot different from a tape.

276
00:20:39,338 --> 00:20:42,774
That's right, dear.
We count on that to make a living.

277
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:51,649
That one from Fountain Valley
looks pretty good.

278
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,208
I got a fountain
she can water her valley with.

279
00:20:54,286 --> 00:20:56,846
- Let me see.
- You shouldn't be allowed to use these...

280
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,890
- The way you screwed things up!
- I didn't.

281
00:20:58,957 --> 00:21:02,358
It's not my fault my mom took
the Polaroid to her Art Photography class!

282
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:05,988
You should've known. This could be
our last shot at these girls, dickhead!

283
00:21:06,064 --> 00:21:07,088
Dickhead?

284
00:21:07,165 --> 00:21:10,293
Okay, no big damage done!
We can pull it off tomorrow.

285
00:21:10,369 --> 00:21:13,702
You better not mess up tomorrow, Freddy.
We already got $22 in orders.

286
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,000
That much, Little Bob?

287
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:18,065
You know that new kid,
the fat one, never suits up for gym?

288
00:21:18,143 --> 00:21:21,340
He bought $8 worth himself.

289
00:21:22,147 --> 00:21:24,707
Wow! Look at that one from Bakersfield.

290
00:21:24,783 --> 00:21:27,684
I got something she could bake in her field.

291
00:21:29,221 --> 00:21:30,552
I hate it.

292
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,952
All right, that'll be another $1
for slandering a fellow officer.

293
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:42,123
You see, old Phil's just mad...

294
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,567
because his auto repair shop
isn't doing as well as my mortuary.

295
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,197
We sell more caskets than he does gaskets.

296
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:54,077
Anyway, I'd like to introduce
our very special guest...

297
00:21:54,146 --> 00:21:56,171
from the Young American Miss Pageant...

298
00:21:56,248 --> 00:22:00,241
first of all, Mrs. Brenda DiCarlo,
who is the pageant supervisor.

299
00:22:02,521 --> 00:22:03,920
Thank you.

300
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:09,526
Brenda, of course, is the wife
of our fellow Bear, Andy DiCarlo.

301
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:11,519
Stand up, Andy.

302
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:16,461
I think old Andy's gonna get fined twice.

303
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:19,732
Once for not showing up,
and once for having such a beautiful wife.

304
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:20,931
Where is he?

305
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,873
Let's give Brenda
and all the other pretty young girls...

306
00:22:23,942 --> 00:22:25,967
a growling Bears' welcome!

307
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,338
Are you having a good time up here?

308
00:22:31,717 --> 00:22:33,651
- Pretty good.
- Very good.

309
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,777
Good.

310
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:37,714
I'm glad you appreciate it so much.

311
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:40,849
I do.
It's such an incredible experience for me.

312
00:22:40,926 --> 00:22:43,622
I mean, I've never done
anything like this in my life.

313
00:22:43,695 --> 00:22:46,163
Santa Rosa is so beautiful.

314
00:22:46,531 --> 00:22:51,059
I mean, I thought the shopping mall
in Anaheim was great until I saw yours.

315
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:55,368
It's a credit to the vision
of your business community.

316
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:02,577
Thank you.

317
00:23:03,682 --> 00:23:04,774
Next.

318
00:23:08,487 --> 00:23:11,115
- Hi, I'm Robin Gibson.
- Speak up, dear.

319
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:15,651
Hi, I'm Robin Gibson.
Antelope Valley's Young American Miss.

320
00:23:17,596 --> 00:23:20,087
Thank you for inviting me to lunch.

321
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:25,127
Next.

322
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:31,233
I'm Maria Gonzales.
Salinas' Young American Miss.

323
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:35,639
And since you gentlemen
have been nice enough to feed us...

324
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:40,749
I would like to feed you
with this homemade guacamole dip.

325
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:44,217
It's a typical dish of my native land, Mexico.

326
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:46,550
You like to try?

327
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,723
How about that?

328
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:55,225
I suppose Santa Rosa...

329
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,360
means so much to me
as a Mexican-American...

330
00:24:01,506 --> 00:24:04,066
because Santa Rosa is Spanish...

331
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:06,537
for "Saint Rose. "

332
00:24:08,146 --> 00:24:11,411
I knew when you stopped showing up
at the Bears and the Optimist...

333
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:13,314
that you must really be down in the dumps.

334
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:17,549
Yeah, I guess. Look, I want to go someplace
where you can get a drink.

335
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,581
- How about a Major Weenie?
- Oh, no!

336
00:24:21,660 --> 00:24:23,150
A foot of fun.

337
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,798
- Your order, please.
- Hiya, pup.

338
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:34,568
Wanna fetch us two El Majors...

339
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:38,672
a couple orders of fries,
and two vanilla shakes.

340
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:42,970
No, make it make it one vanilla shake
and one black coffee.

341
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:45,943
- Will that be all?
- I think so, Major.

342
00:24:47,085 --> 00:24:50,248
Are you sure
you don't want a vanilla shake, Andy?

343
00:24:51,056 --> 00:24:52,523
You'll be sorry.

344
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:57,159
You know, sometimes I think
it's this town that's getting to me.

345
00:24:57,229 --> 00:24:59,925
I mean, I've lived here all my life, right?

346
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:02,899
Maybe I should go someplace
completely new, a big city.

347
00:25:02,968 --> 00:25:06,768
Andy, the grass is always greener
on the other side of the hill.

348
00:25:06,838 --> 00:25:09,830
Andy, you're crazy
to think about moving to a big city.

349
00:25:09,908 --> 00:25:14,709
I had my own mortuary in LA for eight years,
hell, the pace damn near killed me!

350
00:25:19,484 --> 00:25:21,918
You get caught
on the Hollywood freeway at 4:00 pm...

351
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:23,978
with a loaded hearse, and you're in trouble.

352
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:26,888
- The big one's for you.
- I always knew you were a big weenie.

353
00:25:26,958 --> 00:25:29,688
Why are you here?
Haven't you just had lunch with the girls?

354
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:31,251
I'm getting lunch for my embalmers.

355
00:25:31,329 --> 00:25:34,423
They don't like to go out. Takes them
too long to wash their hands.

356
00:25:34,499 --> 00:25:37,468
Andy, you stop all this talk
about leaving town, do you hear me?

357
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,197
Come on, can we get out of here?

358
00:25:39,271 --> 00:25:40,602
Andy!

359
00:25:41,106 --> 00:25:42,937
Who's gonna pay for all this stuff?

360
00:25:43,441 --> 00:25:45,636
That's another thing I hate about this town.

361
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,907
Everybody's always sticking his nose
in everybody else's business.

362
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:52,814
- I want a drink.
- All righty, we'll go to my office.

363
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:58,580
I guess it wouldn't hurt
to have one toddy for the body.

364
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,782
Actually, I feel just the opposite.

365
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:04,291
Attaboy.

366
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:08,624
I like to know my neighbors.
Especially in a small town like this.

367
00:26:12,304 --> 00:26:13,965
Don't you, really?

368
00:26:14,606 --> 00:26:17,131
I'm beginning to think
that's a crock of shit, too.

369
00:26:17,208 --> 00:26:19,733
Come on, Andy.
You're just having a bad day.

370
00:26:19,811 --> 00:26:24,544
I mean, look at all the razzing
we have at all those meetings.

371
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:28,276
The teasing, all of the fining, all that stuff.

372
00:26:28,353 --> 00:26:32,847
- But that's all really just fun, isn't it?
- Doesn't seem like fun to me anymore.

373
00:26:33,091 --> 00:26:37,357
I never know what to say to you
when you say something like that to me.

374
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:41,160
I know something that will be fun.
This Friday night, huh?

375
00:26:43,134 --> 00:26:45,034
The cry of the Rooster.

376
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:50,402
Come on. You actually gonna sit there
and tell me this coming Friday night...

377
00:26:50,475 --> 00:26:53,967
at the Exhausted Rooster Ceremony,
that you're not gonna have a good time?

378
00:26:54,045 --> 00:26:58,004
Bullshit! That's the stuff I'm talking about!

379
00:26:59,351 --> 00:27:01,819
That a guy turns 35,
and the Jaycees make a big deal...

380
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:03,751
about tossing him out
because he's too old?

381
00:27:03,822 --> 00:27:08,020
Listen to yourself. What did you just say?
"A guy turns 35."

382
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,089
That's really what's bugging you, isn't it?
That you're about to turn 35?

383
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:13,391
Maybe.

384
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:21,538
Or maybe I don't see what's fun
about kissing a dead chicken's ass.

385
00:27:21,606 --> 00:27:24,097
That's 'cause you haven't tried it.

386
00:27:24,576 --> 00:27:27,010
"Certainly, external beauty is important...

387
00:27:27,078 --> 00:27:30,104
"but the National Committee
would like to remind all judges...

388
00:27:30,181 --> 00:27:33,082
"of that which Bacon had in mind,
when he said:

389
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:37,212
"'That is the best part of beauty,
which a picture cannot express. '

390
00:27:37,856 --> 00:27:39,949
"We're looking for an inner beauty.

391
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:44,155
"A depth of personality,
a plain zest for living.

392
00:27:44,629 --> 00:27:49,293
"In short, select a girl that you would be
proud to have as your own daughter."

393
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,358
Any questions?

394
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:55,034
- How long do we have with each girl?
- Ten minutes.

395
00:27:56,074 --> 00:27:58,008
Marie, could you tell us why you think...

396
00:27:58,076 --> 00:28:01,637
you'd like to go into missionary work?
In your own words.

397
00:28:03,381 --> 00:28:06,680
It's like if I can share my culture
with someone else...

398
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,981
that way I can learn about theirs...

399
00:28:09,054 --> 00:28:12,956
and enrich my own life as well as,
hopefully, enriching theirs.

400
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,652
Plus, the idea of helping one another.

401
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:18,455
Do you get an enjoyment
out of helping others?

402
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:22,296
Yes, I have. We have
a handicapped Olympics every year...

403
00:28:22,567 --> 00:28:27,095
and we help them get to their races
and their events on time.

404
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:29,939
And, their winning is just...

405
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:32,943
It's the most fantastic thing to experience.

406
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:36,811
Not only themselves, but yourself,
for just helping a little.

407
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,076
Well, I'd like to be a nurse.

408
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:46,352
I think that would be one of the best ways
that I could do things for other people.

409
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:53,295
You see, I want to be
a veterinarian, or a nun...

410
00:28:53,832 --> 00:28:55,595
because I like helping others.

411
00:28:55,667 --> 00:28:58,932
Yeah, I think it would be a lot of fun.
I like helping people.

412
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:01,904
Robin, I noticed that in your senior year...

413
00:29:01,973 --> 00:29:04,703
you went to work part-time at J.C. Penney's.

414
00:29:04,776 --> 00:29:08,303
And yet you still managed
to keep your 4.0 grade average.

415
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:12,515
Did you find that difficult,
to work and still get good grades?

416
00:29:12,951 --> 00:29:14,316
Of course.

417
00:29:18,823 --> 00:29:20,654
I'll bet you found...

418
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:24,353
that the experience of working
was an education in itself.

419
00:29:24,662 --> 00:29:28,029
Yes, it was.
I met a lot of different kinds of people.

420
00:29:28,466 --> 00:29:30,696
- And did you...
- What would...

421
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:33,866
Go right ahead, Father. It's all yours.

422
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:38,406
What would you do if your best friend
was unwed and pregnant?

423
00:29:40,044 --> 00:29:41,375
Excuse me?

424
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:47,178
Would you advise her
to have the baby or seek an abortion?

425
00:29:57,562 --> 00:29:59,621
I thought a lot about that last year...

426
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:03,098
when California was thinking about voting...

427
00:30:03,168 --> 00:30:05,966
on whether to legalize abortion or not.

428
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:11,006
I read a lot about that,
and my mom and I talked about it.

429
00:30:11,376 --> 00:30:12,365
And?

430
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:14,936
What did you decide?

431
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:20,781
I decided I was glad
I wasn't old enough to vote.

432
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:25,622
That's a terrific answer, Father.

433
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:33,787
I see here that you've been a flutist
for nine years.

434
00:30:35,066 --> 00:30:37,762
Boy, you must have been so small
when you started out...

435
00:30:37,836 --> 00:30:40,828
that that was practically
the only instrument you could hold.

436
00:30:40,905 --> 00:30:43,999
I love the flute.
I'm gonna play it in the pageant.

437
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:47,374
By the looks of all these
wonderful music awards that you've won...

438
00:30:47,445 --> 00:30:50,573
we're certainly in for quite a treat, aren't we?

439
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:55,613
Why do you like to play the flute, dear?
In your own words.

440
00:30:58,022 --> 00:31:00,013
Lots of reasons, I guess.

441
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,351
Well, it sounds so pretty.

442
00:31:06,764 --> 00:31:10,564
And when I play it right, it fills me up inside.

443
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:16,803
I do guess I like being in the spotlight,
it's glamorous and exciting.

444
00:31:17,642 --> 00:31:21,043
And you must be pleased as punch,
making all those other people happy.

445
00:31:21,112 --> 00:31:22,443
Pardon me?

446
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:26,380
The other people who are listening
to you playing the flute.

447
00:31:26,484 --> 00:31:30,352
Nothing lightens a person's spirit
or brightens their load like a little music.

448
00:31:30,421 --> 00:31:32,514
- Isn't that right, Robin?
- Oh, yes.

449
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:36,287
I think my music is one of the best ways
I can help others.

450
00:31:44,035 --> 00:31:48,768
Jerry, you told me Fort Worth was all set,
and now you want to lower the price.

451
00:31:49,941 --> 00:31:53,809
I realize it's a summer show,
but why should they pay so much less?

452
00:31:54,245 --> 00:31:55,269
Shit.

453
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:58,882
It's harder to stage dances in the summer.
It's more sweat.

454
00:32:03,955 --> 00:32:08,119
Tell them there's absolutely no way
I'll take the job at that price.

455
00:32:08,826 --> 00:32:12,387
And if that doesn't work,
then fall on your knees and beg.

456
00:32:13,965 --> 00:32:18,459
I'll be back Sunday, unless I decide
to stay here for the polling seminar.

457
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,264
Oh, well.

458
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:35,975
Mr. French, we have a show
to do in two days. You're 40 minutes late.

459
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:38,648
- Forgive me, Mr. Sheep.
- That's Shears.

460
00:32:41,225 --> 00:32:45,355
I realize that you and I
have gotten off to a rather shaky start...

461
00:32:46,164 --> 00:32:49,691
but things don't have to stay that way.
What do you say?

462
00:32:51,169 --> 00:32:52,932
Let's keep it shaky.

463
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:54,664
Okay, girls.

464
00:32:54,806 --> 00:32:59,072
Oh, hell. It's 6 feet too tall. I told you.

465
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:08,747
Oh, no.

466
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,845
Take it from the faith and hope stuff, right?

467
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:15,222
Ready to start out, singing our hearts out

468
00:33:15,593 --> 00:33:18,426
We'll see a bright tomorrow

469
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:21,192
Built by youth you see today

470
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:24,428
We have faith, we have hope

471
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:28,297
We can see a brighter day

472
00:33:28,439 --> 00:33:30,737
We're here singing
And we're here to dance

473
00:33:30,808 --> 00:33:31,900
Move!

474
00:33:31,976 --> 00:33:34,774
And everyone's here with an equal chance

475
00:33:34,846 --> 00:33:38,509
To be crowned a Young American

476
00:33:38,783 --> 00:33:44,483
Young American Miss

477
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:07,978
And one, kick, three and four!

478
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:10,072
Hold it!

479
00:34:13,151 --> 00:34:15,711
- Another luncheon.
- Are these the guys that roar?

480
00:34:15,787 --> 00:34:18,517
No, these are the ones
with tassels on their hats.

481
00:34:18,589 --> 00:34:23,026
Folks, please, now this is No Man's Land,
and I'm telling you, you can't get...

482
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:47,345
Where is he?

483
00:34:47,418 --> 00:34:50,251
We should have never let
the little asshole Freddy in on this.

484
00:34:50,321 --> 00:34:53,085
He better show!
We now have $36 worth of orders.

485
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:54,249
Jesus!

486
00:34:54,325 --> 00:34:57,317
I got it all worked out.
$1.50 for back shot with butt.

487
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,192
$2.50 for frontal shots.

488
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:03,029
And $5 if I can get a shot
with two naked girls touching each other.

489
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,500
Where's Freddy?

490
00:35:08,372 --> 00:35:11,341
- What took you so long?
- I got here, didn't I?

491
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:15,004
Complete with camera
and my own personal zoom lens.

492
00:35:15,079 --> 00:35:16,876
You're weird, Freddy.

493
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,777
- Where's the film?
- Isn't it in there?

494
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:23,252
- No.
- But in the ads, the film is always in there.

495
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:25,516
You asshole! I'm gonna kick your butt!

496
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,217
Come on!

497
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:30,022
- You're dead!
- We got no time to argue.

498
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:32,119
You tore my shirt, you faggot!

499
00:35:32,196 --> 00:35:34,926
So we missed the girls
putting on their clothes.

500
00:35:34,999 --> 00:35:38,127
We'll get some film and catch them
when they come back from lunch...

501
00:35:38,202 --> 00:35:39,726
taking off their clothes.

502
00:35:39,937 --> 00:35:42,201
Yeah. Taking off their clothes.

503
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:44,839
Let's go.
Boy, I can't wait to see these pictures.

504
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:49,039
You want to see something
that will develop even faster than the film?

505
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:50,839
Pick up my bike.

506
00:35:51,716 --> 00:35:52,876
Eat it!

507
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:03,550
- Hello, boys.
- Hello, Mr. Greener.

508
00:36:03,728 --> 00:36:05,559
Have you got film for this camera?

509
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,997
We've been to two other stores,
and they're both out.

510
00:36:09,066 --> 00:36:13,503
You're in luck. Guaranteed shipment
coming in first thing in the morning.

511
00:36:14,572 --> 00:36:17,268
- Santa Rosa sucks.
- Wait a minute, boys.

512
00:36:18,643 --> 00:36:22,670
If there's something special happening,
I'll lend you a camera with film.

513
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:24,271
- You will?
- Sure.

514
00:36:24,348 --> 00:36:26,680
Would this be a Polaroid camera?

515
00:36:27,318 --> 00:36:29,718
Sorry, those babies are never for loan.

516
00:36:29,787 --> 00:36:32,278
So you'd have to send the film to a lab?

517
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:36,452
Sure. But, don't worry.
I'll check every print myself.

518
00:36:37,228 --> 00:36:42,165
No, thanks, Mr. Greener, we'll be back
in the morning for the Polaroid film.

519
00:36:45,303 --> 00:36:49,899
Even Jake, the plumber
He's a man I adore

520
00:36:50,808 --> 00:36:55,507
Had the nerve to tell me
he's been married before!

521
00:36:56,214 --> 00:37:00,674
Everyone knows that I'm just
Secondhand Rose

522
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:05,847
From Second Avenue!

523
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:07,282
Oy vey!

524
00:37:10,895 --> 00:37:12,055
Next.

525
00:37:21,205 --> 00:37:22,570
Well, hello.

526
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:28,041
Are you here to sing or to make butter?

527
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,677
They told me to come in costume.

528
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:33,740
No, dear, that's tomorrow.

529
00:37:36,821 --> 00:37:38,914
I don't like that music man.

530
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:42,057
He's mean to the Young American Misses.

531
00:37:42,193 --> 00:37:46,687
It's a depressing thing to see one person
being mean to another person.

532
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:51,758
I need a drink.

533
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:10,177
For those who think young.

534
00:38:17,094 --> 00:38:18,959
What is it, Mr. Nakas?

535
00:38:29,774 --> 00:38:31,298
It's starting.

536
00:38:31,809 --> 00:38:34,175
I told them it would start, and it started.

537
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:36,770
- What?
- The pipes are backed up.

538
00:38:37,415 --> 00:38:41,146
I can hear them moaning and grumbling
and starting to choke.

539
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:43,850
I can't hear nothing.

540
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:46,882
I got an acute sense of hearing pipes.

541
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:52,285
There they go.

542
00:38:53,264 --> 00:38:55,858
They're fed up with swallowing Kotex.

543
00:38:57,101 --> 00:38:58,500
Who wouldn't be?

544
00:38:58,903 --> 00:39:02,236
I don't really think of it
as a competition that much...

545
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:06,333
because we all want to win, but we're
not really competing with each other.

546
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,775
We're more friends.

547
00:39:07,845 --> 00:39:11,872
I guess I'll just be happy that I was here.

548
00:39:11,949 --> 00:39:14,782
I think it was a good opportunity for me...

549
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:16,285
and I've met a lot of people...

550
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:20,921
Next to my mom and dad,
I guess I'd have to say my accordion.

551
00:39:21,492 --> 00:39:25,019
The Young American Miss from Salinas,
Maria Gonzales.

552
00:39:25,596 --> 00:39:27,564
- Yes, ma'am.
- You're next.

553
00:39:28,666 --> 00:39:30,429
What is that, dear?

554
00:39:32,403 --> 00:39:35,736
I thought the judges would be hungry
after helping us so long...

555
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:38,775
so I made them a specialty
of my native land.

556
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,807
It's guacamole dip.

557
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:44,340
Like you did for the Bears.

558
00:39:45,449 --> 00:39:46,438
Si.

559
00:39:49,186 --> 00:39:51,882
God, how can you stand
being her roommate?

560
00:39:52,123 --> 00:39:53,283
It's all right.

561
00:39:53,357 --> 00:39:57,316
She spends most of her time in the kitchen
making guacamole dip.

562
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:02,325
Abraham Lincoln and Pancho Villa
symbolize my own theory...

563
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:16,505
Hello, this is Ernestine, the operator,
calling for Miss Pearl Bailey.

564
00:40:16,847 --> 00:40:20,943
Well, I'm sorry if she's tired,
but could you please put her on?

565
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,776
It's very important.

566
00:40:22,853 --> 00:40:25,151
Their parents made them beautiful,
not them.

567
00:40:26,791 --> 00:40:28,554
I got it.

568
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:34,292
Boys get money and scholarships
for making a lot of touchdowns, right?

569
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:37,667
Why shouldn't a girl get one
for being cute and charming?

570
00:40:37,735 --> 00:40:42,695
Yeah, but maybe boys shouldn't be
getting money for making touchdowns.

571
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:51,704
Hello, this is Ernestine, the operator.
Who am I speaking to?

572
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:57,578
This is Edith Bunker, the dingbat.

573
00:40:57,922 --> 00:41:01,016
And one, two, three, four.

574
00:41:01,091 --> 00:41:03,685
Coming along. Okay, now watch this.

575
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:06,229
And kick and bend.

576
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,334
No, if you kick and bend at the same time,
you're going to knock yourself out.

577
00:41:14,405 --> 00:41:17,135
All right, once again. Here we go, and...

578
00:41:17,408 --> 00:41:20,707
Spring is here!

579
00:41:21,078 --> 00:41:25,481
Why doesn't the breeze delight me?

580
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:29,344
Stars appear!

581
00:41:29,687 --> 00:41:33,589
Why doesn't the night invite me?

582
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:36,885
Maybe it's because nobody loves me

583
00:41:36,961 --> 00:41:38,622
I went to Juilliard for this?

584
00:41:40,364 --> 00:41:42,389
We all went to Juilliard.

585
00:41:42,867 --> 00:41:48,203
Spring is here, I hear!

586
00:41:53,644 --> 00:41:56,340
Summer in the sunshine

587
00:41:58,482 --> 00:42:01,280
Days that never end

588
00:42:03,921 --> 00:42:06,014
When the spotlight

589
00:42:09,560 --> 00:42:11,221
DiCarlo Trophies.

590
00:42:11,762 --> 00:42:13,286
Golfer awards?

591
00:42:13,764 --> 00:42:15,527
Worst golfer awards?

592
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,694
Hey, Andy. You got the trophies?

593
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:22,637
- Yeah, I'm working on them.
- Working on them?

594
00:42:22,706 --> 00:42:25,174
What the hell, Andy,
the first show's tonight.

595
00:42:25,242 --> 00:42:27,437
Your wife told me to come over
and pick them up.

596
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:29,502
You tell my wife to go...

597
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:35,080
It's a little drunken golfer
leaning on his putter.

598
00:42:35,352 --> 00:42:38,753
Alan, tell my wife I'm working on them.

599
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:43,454
- Ramon will bring them over this afternoon.
- Okay, you're the boss.

600
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:48,064
No, she's the boss. She just doesn't know
how to make trophies.

601
00:42:48,799 --> 00:42:52,997
Now, at this point, I take my sparklers
and I light them with my Torch of Freedom.

602
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,298
But you don't have to worry...

603
00:42:54,371 --> 00:42:56,635
But let's not put
too much powder in these things.

604
00:42:56,707 --> 00:42:59,938
If we're gonna have a fire,
save it for the last night.

605
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,478
I know how to handle my equipment.

606
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:06,107
Now, I want red and green gels
at both the spots at my entrance...

607
00:43:06,183 --> 00:43:09,812
and I want the senior klieg at 50%
when I do my high tosses because...

608
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:13,015
- Yeah, yeah.
- Por favor, you're on.

609
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:19,727
Helga, when you go out there, be sure to...

610
00:43:19,797 --> 00:43:22,391
Will you please shut the door?

611
00:43:22,666 --> 00:43:24,224
Amigos!

612
00:43:24,835 --> 00:43:28,931
I would like to tell you the tale
of two great nations.

613
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,238
One, my humble place of birth.

614
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:35,335
And one, my new homeland!

615
00:43:36,213 --> 00:43:38,443
Applause, applause, applause.

616
00:43:39,149 --> 00:43:43,848
To tell you this tale, I will need the help
of two old friends.

617
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:47,186
These are my friends.

618
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:48,383
Cue tape.

619
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:51,858
One is named Chico...

620
00:43:51,929 --> 00:43:54,659
and the other's named Joe.

621
00:43:54,732 --> 00:43:57,792
Yes, ladies and gentlemen, you guessed it.

622
00:43:57,868 --> 00:44:00,359
This is a tale about, of course...

623
00:44:00,437 --> 00:44:04,931
Mexico, and these United States!

624
00:44:05,009 --> 00:44:06,169
Gross.

625
00:44:06,944 --> 00:44:11,040
In the beginning,
these two great neighboring giants...

626
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:13,481
hardly knew each other existed.

627
00:44:13,717 --> 00:44:16,277
But soon, they discovered each other...

628
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:20,449
and their respect for each other
grew higher...

629
00:44:22,192 --> 00:44:25,184
Last night she gave
our host parents a pinata.

630
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:29,790
- I'm gonna get her.
- Do you want me to help?

631
00:44:29,967 --> 00:44:31,025
Yeah.

632
00:44:31,702 --> 00:44:34,671
We'll do it as soon as we're sure we've lost.

633
00:44:36,006 --> 00:44:37,405
...forever...

634
00:44:38,142 --> 00:44:41,839
by these two wonderful,
marvelous countries.

635
00:44:56,760 --> 00:45:00,093
Excuse me, dear. I'm going to interrupt you
just for a moment.

636
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:01,893
Girls, I'd like you to meet...

637
00:45:01,965 --> 00:45:06,026
California's reigning Young American Miss,
Jo Ann Marshall.

638
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:11,241
And these are some of the former winners
and has-beens.

639
00:45:13,010 --> 00:45:16,138
Jo Ann and the girls are going to be
rehearsing with you today...

640
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:19,015
Girls, here's our emcee...

641
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:21,984
the real star of the show, Ted Farley.

642
00:45:24,021 --> 00:45:28,355
Hi, girls. I'm sorry to hear about
the little problem you had with the toilets...

643
00:45:28,425 --> 00:45:31,155
but as they say in France, "No wee-wee."

644
00:45:41,305 --> 00:45:44,138
- Keep the motor running.
- I got my motor running.

645
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:45,470
Jeez.

646
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:06,487
- Where do you think you're going?
- I'm looking for my dad.

647
00:46:06,563 --> 00:46:10,590
Your dad's not around here.
Unless he's a teenage girl.

648
00:46:10,667 --> 00:46:13,568
- No, my dad is Robert Freelander.
- Big Bob?

649
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,997
Yeah, you must be Little Bob.

650
00:46:16,073 --> 00:46:17,904
- Yeah, Little Bob.
- Yeah, right.

651
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:19,909
Say, what can I do for you back here?

652
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:23,743
Well, I was supposed to meet my father
and I've looked all over.

653
00:46:23,814 --> 00:46:26,612
Now, you know Big Bob.
Everywhere at once.

654
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:30,515
Tell you what now, nobody's
supposed to be back here on this path...

655
00:46:30,587 --> 00:46:32,953
since you're Little Bob,
I think it'll be all right.

656
00:46:33,023 --> 00:46:34,047
Yeah, thanks.

657
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:37,116
Tell you what, why don't you look
down there by those telephones?

658
00:46:37,194 --> 00:46:39,219
I think you'll find him there. Okay?

659
00:46:39,296 --> 00:46:42,857
- All right, we'll see you later, little buddy.
- Goodbye.

660
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,287
Oh, my God!

661
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:16,382
Somebody's at the window!

662
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:33,736
I was looking for my dad.
Big Bob. Good old Big Bob.

663
00:48:34,344 --> 00:48:38,007
I tripped and fell in there.
I wasn't taking any pictures of the girls.

664
00:48:38,081 --> 00:48:40,208
I swear on my mother's life!

665
00:50:10,640 --> 00:50:13,006
Thirteen, fourteen,
fifteen, sixteen, seventeen...

666
00:50:13,076 --> 00:50:14,634
Sorry, it's the lights.

667
00:50:14,711 --> 00:50:17,874
Me ol' bam-boo
You better never bother with me ol' bam-boo

668
00:50:17,948 --> 00:50:19,609
You can have me hat or me bumber-shoot

669
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:25,417
But you better never bother
with me ol' bam-boo

670
00:50:44,941 --> 00:50:47,637
She's fine!

671
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:51,511
Easy, easy. Hold her carefully.
Stand back, kids. Give her some air!

672
00:50:51,581 --> 00:50:53,845
You're all right. She's fine.

673
00:50:53,917 --> 00:50:56,715
- Now give her some air.
- She's fine. Everything is fine.

674
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:58,118
She'll be all right.

675
00:50:58,188 --> 00:51:01,248
- Who is that?
- Maureen somebody.

676
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:04,627
What happened?

677
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:07,060
One of the girls fainted. She'll be all right.

678
00:51:07,130 --> 00:51:10,463
Did she trip? Trip over a nail or something
we could be sued for?

679
00:51:10,534 --> 00:51:13,298
No, and I'll tell her how concerned you were.

680
00:51:13,370 --> 00:51:17,067
- Jesus Christ, she scared me half to death.
- I almost fainted.

681
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:19,574
Well, it is one less competition.

682
00:51:21,778 --> 00:51:24,246
God, I'm really sorry I said that.

683
00:51:24,681 --> 00:51:27,309
- I have an awful confession to make.
- Yeah?

684
00:51:27,384 --> 00:51:31,286
You know when Maureen fainted?
The same thing crossed my mind.

685
00:51:32,689 --> 00:51:34,714
- It's getting weird.
- Judy!

686
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:47,902
Has anybody seen my butter churn?

687
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,934
Now listen. Just listen.

688
00:51:55,745 --> 00:52:00,239
In about two minutes, you'll go out there
and be professional dancers.

689
00:52:00,917 --> 00:52:03,545
Your job is to make the audience happy.

690
00:52:03,820 --> 00:52:06,983
I know that a lot of you are scared
and don't think you can do it.

691
00:52:07,057 --> 00:52:11,084
But I've been watching you all
very carefully, and I know that you can.

692
00:52:11,161 --> 00:52:14,358
Now I'd like you to think
about a 1 7-year-old kid...

693
00:52:14,431 --> 00:52:18,231
who came to me when I was staging dances
for the Mike Curb Congregation.

694
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:20,565
She hadn't had a bit of experience...

695
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:24,164
but she wanted to try so bad
that we just had to let her.

696
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:26,876
That was four years ago...

697
00:52:26,943 --> 00:52:30,435
and now that girl
is one of the Mike Curb lead dancers.

698
00:52:31,848 --> 00:52:34,339
Now, that may not seem like much
to you ladies...

699
00:52:34,417 --> 00:52:37,113
but that girl has a wooden foot.

700
00:52:39,523 --> 00:52:42,822
Now go out there and dance
with your two good feet.

701
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:49,595
That was really a beautiful story.

702
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:53,397
Listen, I have a syndicated radio show
heard in four states.

703
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:56,461
I'm always looking
for inspirational youth stories.

704
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:59,270
- Do you mind if I use that?
- Be my guest.

705
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:01,310
But it's total bullshit.

706
00:53:03,747 --> 00:53:05,738
- Hello!
- Hello!

707
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:07,339
Who says hello?

708
00:53:07,551 --> 00:53:09,542
Young America!

709
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:12,952
- Are you all here?
- Yes, we're all here!

710
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:22,723
Ready to start out, singing our hearts out

711
00:53:22,799 --> 00:53:25,734
We can see a bright tomorrow

712
00:53:25,802 --> 00:53:28,566
Built by youth you see today

713
00:53:28,638 --> 00:53:31,436
We have faith, we have hope

714
00:53:31,508 --> 00:53:34,966
We can see a brighter day

715
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:38,139
We're here to sing
We're here to dance

716
00:53:38,215 --> 00:53:40,775
Everyone's here with an equal chance

717
00:53:40,850 --> 00:53:44,183
To be crowned a Young American

718
00:53:44,454 --> 00:53:50,290
Young American Miss

719
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:54,293
- Pick your favorite and sing along
- Tap your feet and sing our song

720
00:53:54,364 --> 00:53:57,356
We can see a bright tomorrow

721
00:53:57,467 --> 00:53:59,992
Built by youth you see today

722
00:54:00,070 --> 00:54:05,872
We have faith, we have hope

723
00:54:06,409 --> 00:54:11,972
We can see a brighter day

724
00:54:16,186 --> 00:54:17,517
Take it away!

725
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:34,864
Hi, I'm Jo Ann Marshall,
California's Young American Miss.

726
00:54:35,338 --> 00:54:38,739
And I'd like to welcome you
to tonight's first preliminary show...

727
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:40,935
and invite you back for tomorrow's show.

728
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:43,741
And the really big show, Saturday night.

729
00:55:08,204 --> 00:55:11,731
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!

730
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:15,039
Me ol' bam-boo
You better never bother with me ol' bam-boo

731
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:16,874
You can have me hat or me bumber-shoot

732
00:55:16,946 --> 00:55:19,506
But you better never bother
with me ol' bam-boo

733
00:55:27,390 --> 00:55:30,325
You know something?
You did a hell of a job.

734
00:55:31,361 --> 00:55:35,024
Took a bunch of nice high-school kids,
and turned them into Vegas showgirls.

735
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,899
On each of these preliminary nights,
we feature and judge...

736
00:55:41,970 --> 00:55:44,905
the creative talents of the girls
from one color group.

737
00:55:44,973 --> 00:55:49,239
Tonight, settle back, relax, and enjoy
the creative talents of the peach group.

738
00:55:49,311 --> 00:55:51,370
This could mean 3o points to them.

739
00:55:51,980 --> 00:55:56,417
Doria has written and will deliver an essay
based on personal experience.

740
00:55:56,852 --> 00:56:01,050
Here she is, Anaheim's
Young American Miss, Doria Houston.

741
00:56:03,658 --> 00:56:05,387
Beauty, yes.

742
00:56:06,128 --> 00:56:09,063
Curly hair, floppy hat...

743
00:56:09,798 --> 00:56:13,325
glittery dresses, they were in...

744
00:56:13,468 --> 00:56:15,197
so I have them all.

745
00:56:15,704 --> 00:56:20,300
But one day, on my mad dash
to the cosmetics counter...

746
00:56:21,043 --> 00:56:24,877
I stumbled by chance into a library.

747
00:56:30,452 --> 00:56:33,216
"To thine own self be true. "

748
00:56:34,056 --> 00:56:37,890
At last I had found a beauty aid
that didn't come in a bottle. ;

749
00:56:39,928 --> 00:56:41,293
Simplicity.

750
00:56:42,531 --> 00:56:47,195
I learned that one single solid gold strand...

751
00:56:47,969 --> 00:56:52,201
could be more beautiful
than all my costume jewelry.

752
00:57:40,856 --> 00:57:44,815
Off came the silly shoes,
the hat, all that glittered.

753
00:57:45,293 --> 00:57:48,922
Soon with shiny nonsense
my floor was littered.

754
00:57:49,631 --> 00:57:51,929
If you wanna be a real cutie...

755
00:57:52,200 --> 00:57:54,828
always strive for inner beauty.

756
00:57:59,174 --> 00:58:03,304
"Consider the lilies of the field,
how they grow.

757
00:58:04,346 --> 00:58:07,804
"They work not, they toil not.

758
00:58:10,051 --> 00:58:14,385
"Yet I say unto you
That even Solomon in all his glory...

759
00:58:15,056 --> 00:58:18,924
"was not so beautiful as these. "

760
00:58:24,533 --> 00:58:25,864
Thank you.

761
00:58:27,836 --> 00:58:29,804
And now, a double treat.

762
00:58:29,971 --> 00:58:33,270
Healdsburg's Young American Miss,
Bobbi Erickson...

763
00:58:33,341 --> 00:58:36,572
will play the ever popular
and thrilling Ebb Tide...

764
00:58:36,645 --> 00:58:41,082
and simultaneously she will
at the same time exhibit her paintings.

765
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:43,848
A feast for both eyes and ears.

766
00:59:28,897 --> 00:59:33,095
Delta Dawn, what's that flower you have on?

767
00:59:33,602 --> 00:59:38,596
Could it be a faded rose from days gone by?

768
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:43,439
And did I hear you say
he was meeting you here today

769
00:59:44,246 --> 00:59:49,183
To take you to his mansion in the sky

770
01:00:05,500 --> 01:00:11,029
You were meant for me

771
01:00:11,473 --> 01:00:16,376
I was meant for you

772
01:00:17,445 --> 01:00:22,473
Nature patterned you
And when she was done

773
01:00:22,984 --> 01:00:28,388
You were all the sweet things
Rolled up in one

774
01:00:59,120 --> 01:01:01,088
"Rotting maggots of death...

775
01:01:01,756 --> 01:01:04,953
"crawling out of the skull of war.

776
01:01:05,627 --> 01:01:06,855
"Vomit...

777
01:01:07,529 --> 01:01:11,295
"and blood run freely over the battlefield. "

778
01:01:20,175 --> 01:01:23,736
Even in the Young American Miss's concern
of her own personal appearance...

779
01:01:23,812 --> 01:01:25,370
and the way she conducts herself...

780
01:01:25,447 --> 01:01:29,281
gives to others the feeling
that she cares for them. And she does.

781
01:01:29,351 --> 01:01:31,717
We share with her
this concern for the individual...

782
01:01:31,786 --> 01:01:35,517
as she participates now
in the Gown and Grace Division.

783
01:02:13,128 --> 01:02:15,824
- Where are you going?
- Oh, Mr. French.

784
01:02:15,897 --> 01:02:18,388
Quit bawling, Robin.
You just had a lucky break.

785
01:02:18,466 --> 01:02:21,765
Now they'll notice you.
So go out there, and use it.

786
01:02:24,739 --> 01:02:28,835
Hi. I'm Helga Kleinsmidth,
Vacaville's Young American Miss...

787
01:02:29,043 --> 01:02:32,479
and I think it's fun to have pillow fights
on Sunday morning...

788
01:02:32,547 --> 01:02:34,674
before church with my folks.

789
01:02:41,356 --> 01:02:44,291
Buenas noches. I am Maria Gonzales...

790
01:02:44,359 --> 01:02:49,194
and I think it is fun to live in a land
of equal opportunity for all its citizens...

791
01:02:49,264 --> 01:02:52,165
regardless of race, creed, or color.

792
01:03:00,875 --> 01:03:04,709
Hi, I'm Robin Gibson,
Antelope Valley's Young American Miss...

793
01:03:04,913 --> 01:03:08,542
and I think it's embarrassing
to have your umbrella break.

794
01:03:11,085 --> 01:03:12,677
They learn fast.

795
01:03:18,726 --> 01:03:23,254
Our fourth judge is a former
Young American Miss from 1966...

796
01:03:23,631 --> 01:03:25,394
Miss Gloria Randall.

797
01:03:30,505 --> 01:03:34,134
Didn't I tell you, folks,
the girls get prettier every year?

798
01:03:35,310 --> 01:03:39,713
And again this year, holding the envelopes
with the names of tonight's winners...

799
01:03:39,781 --> 01:03:44,241
our Dean of judges and a winner
in his own right, Big Bob Freelander.

800
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:46,344
Big Bob, hey!

801
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:50,814
Welcome, folks!

802
01:03:50,892 --> 01:03:55,158
I know you came to see a whale of a show,
and a whale of a show it is.

803
01:03:55,630 --> 01:03:57,825
How does Santa Rosa feel about that?

804
01:04:02,837 --> 01:04:04,464
But you know, folks...

805
01:04:04,539 --> 01:04:09,169
to these talented
and lovely high-school girls...

806
01:04:09,244 --> 01:04:11,940
from all over this great state of ours...

807
01:04:12,013 --> 01:04:14,709
this is a lot more than just another show.

808
01:04:14,782 --> 01:04:17,182
Tonight, for them, is the big one.

809
01:04:17,819 --> 01:04:20,686
Of course, this is just a preliminary night.

810
01:04:20,755 --> 01:04:23,656
Tickets are still on sale
for the next two nights...

811
01:04:23,725 --> 01:04:26,785
Right, three nights in all.
Four winners each night.

812
01:04:26,861 --> 01:04:28,089
Lots of winners.

813
01:05:33,561 --> 01:05:36,689
Doria, you know the judges
were dumb, anyway.

814
01:05:37,332 --> 01:05:39,630
You were much better
than that girl that won.

815
01:05:39,701 --> 01:05:42,636
You don't have to
cheer me up anymore, Robin.

816
01:05:43,204 --> 01:05:46,731
What the hell,
now that I know I'm not winning anything...

817
01:05:47,075 --> 01:05:48,474
I can smoke.

818
01:05:51,946 --> 01:05:54,676
I thought we weren't supposed
to smoke around the girls.

819
01:05:54,749 --> 01:05:56,614
That's what the committee said.

820
01:05:56,684 --> 01:05:58,311
If she can smoke, I can smoke.

821
01:05:58,386 --> 01:06:01,321
They told us a lot of girls
didn't win the preliminaries...

822
01:06:01,389 --> 01:06:04,654
they went on to win the contest.
I mean, talent's only part of it.

823
01:06:04,726 --> 01:06:07,991
Forget it, Robin.
Talent was my ace in the hole.

824
01:06:08,262 --> 01:06:11,789
If they don't like me taking off my clothes,
they're gonna hate my grades.

825
01:06:11,866 --> 01:06:14,596
You shouldn't be so sure
you're not gonna win.

826
01:06:14,669 --> 01:06:16,261
I don't mind it.

827
01:06:16,671 --> 01:06:20,198
I did at first,
now it's kind of a relief, you know.

828
01:06:21,409 --> 01:06:24,936
Besides, now I can pass
all my little tricks on to you.

829
01:06:25,013 --> 01:06:26,207
Tricks?

830
01:06:26,748 --> 01:06:30,548
Yeah, I guess I should have before,
but we were in competition.

831
01:06:30,618 --> 01:06:32,779
What kind of tricks?

832
01:06:34,088 --> 01:06:36,613
Little things I know that you don't.

833
01:06:36,724 --> 01:06:38,055
Like what?

834
01:06:38,292 --> 01:06:40,783
Like tonight, for instance.

835
01:06:41,095 --> 01:06:43,962
You didn't jump up and down enough
when Miss Woodland won.

836
01:06:44,032 --> 01:06:47,365
And you didn't even cry
when you won yourself.

837
01:06:47,435 --> 01:06:48,629
Is that bad?

838
01:06:48,703 --> 01:06:52,332
It sure is. Beauty contest judges
like their emotions big.

839
01:06:53,608 --> 01:06:55,166
And you don't smile enough.

840
01:06:55,243 --> 01:06:57,837
My God, I've smiled so much
my gums are raw.

841
01:06:57,912 --> 01:07:00,608
Put some Vaseline on your teeth.
It helps your...

842
01:07:00,682 --> 01:07:03,480
- It helps your lips glide over them.
- You're kidding me.

843
01:07:03,551 --> 01:07:05,519
No. All the girls do it.

844
01:07:05,586 --> 01:07:08,555
And Maria Gonzales puts enough on
to grease a flagpole.

845
01:07:08,623 --> 01:07:09,885
- No!
- Yes.

846
01:07:10,058 --> 01:07:12,219
Get some pantyhose.

847
01:07:12,860 --> 01:07:16,057
Bare legs are kind of splotchy
under the spotlights.

848
01:07:16,130 --> 01:07:20,032
- Doria, I'm not gonna do all that.
- You're crazy not to.

849
01:07:20,101 --> 01:07:22,569
You have a real chance
of winning the money.

850
01:07:22,637 --> 01:07:24,537
- Get off it.
- Robin, you do.

851
01:07:24,605 --> 01:07:26,596
Look, you've already won
Vim and Vigor, right?

852
01:07:26,674 --> 01:07:30,269
You have great grades and
you play the flute, which is a classic talent.

853
01:07:30,344 --> 01:07:33,074
If you'd just keep smiling, you can win.

854
01:07:33,381 --> 01:07:37,875
And it wouldn't hurt to mention
once in a while that you have no father.

855
01:07:38,986 --> 01:07:41,386
Was that a terrible thing to say?

856
01:07:42,056 --> 01:07:46,390
No. It's just that they keep telling us
this thing isn't a competition.

857
01:07:47,762 --> 01:07:49,491
It's a competition.

858
01:07:54,268 --> 01:07:56,828
I still don't understand
how you could do this to me.

859
01:07:56,904 --> 01:07:59,429
Dad, I wasn't doing anything to you.

860
01:07:59,574 --> 01:08:01,804
You hurt the pageant, hurt me.

861
01:08:02,143 --> 01:08:05,943
Seven years without a scandal,
and now my own son causes one.

862
01:08:06,247 --> 01:08:09,774
- What am I supposed to say to people?
- Tell them I'm adopted.

863
01:08:09,851 --> 01:08:12,445
Robert Freelander, Jr.,
you have a sassy mouth.

864
01:08:12,520 --> 01:08:14,920
You should be a little humble
after what you did.

865
01:08:14,989 --> 01:08:16,650
Now wipe that off.

866
01:08:16,758 --> 01:08:18,885
I don't see why I have to see a psychiatrist.

867
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:21,394
Do you want to go to jail?
That's the big alternative.

868
01:08:21,462 --> 01:08:23,191
Come on, we'll go to jail.

869
01:08:23,264 --> 01:08:25,562
- Do you want to go to jail?
- No.

870
01:08:25,666 --> 01:08:27,657
- And you're gonna go in here now?
- Yes.

871
01:08:27,735 --> 01:08:32,365
Take your hands out of your pocket.
You're very lucky you're my son, you know.

872
01:08:35,042 --> 01:08:38,773
If this doctor thinks I'm crazy,
wait till he meets Freddy.

873
01:08:39,847 --> 01:08:43,749
Dr. Kelly. Code Blue, five east.

874
01:08:53,928 --> 01:08:55,293
Here it is.

875
01:09:02,570 --> 01:09:04,765
- Mrs. Chambers...
- It's my fault. I feel guilty.

876
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:06,101
Hi, Doctor.

877
01:09:06,174 --> 01:09:10,235
Your appointment will be in a few moments.
Would you mind, please?

878
01:09:36,504 --> 01:09:40,736
I must admit I'm really not too sold
on this psychiatry stuff myself.

879
01:09:42,176 --> 01:09:45,373
Seems like an awful lot of self-pity in it
to me.

880
01:09:49,116 --> 01:09:50,913
You may come in now.

881
01:09:53,621 --> 01:09:55,816
- Please have a chair.
- Where's Mrs. Chambers?

882
01:09:55,890 --> 01:09:57,187
She left.

883
01:10:00,294 --> 01:10:02,023
Oh, two entrances.

884
01:10:02,997 --> 01:10:05,056
Make yourself comfortable.

885
01:10:08,302 --> 01:10:11,100
Now, you're Robert Freelander.

886
01:10:11,172 --> 01:10:13,231
No, we're both Robert Freelander.

887
01:10:13,307 --> 01:10:15,332
Big Bob. Little Bob.

888
01:10:16,677 --> 01:10:19,612
How long have you
called your son Little Bob?

889
01:10:19,881 --> 01:10:23,612
Why, ever since he was little.

890
01:10:32,894 --> 01:10:37,558
Actually, I'd hoped to meet both parents
at the initial consultation.

891
01:10:37,698 --> 01:10:40,496
Mrs. Freelander is ill. She's got the flu.

892
01:10:40,935 --> 01:10:43,597
She got it the minute I got in trouble.

893
01:10:43,671 --> 01:10:45,366
Does your mother get sick often?

894
01:10:45,439 --> 01:10:47,839
Doctor, we're not here to discuss my wife.

895
01:10:48,075 --> 01:10:51,442
Your wife is this boy's mother.
In order to discuss his problems...

896
01:10:51,512 --> 01:10:55,710
What are you guys always trying
to pin everything on a guy's mother for?

897
01:10:57,685 --> 01:11:00,347
Mr. Freelander, are you angry with me?

898
01:11:03,157 --> 01:11:05,148
No, I'm not angry at you.

899
01:11:09,931 --> 01:11:12,263
Of course I'm not angry at you.

900
01:11:13,000 --> 01:11:15,491
I'm just trying to help Little...

901
01:11:17,138 --> 01:11:20,164
You and I are both here
trying to help my son.

902
01:11:31,886 --> 01:11:35,185
We could begin the consultations
alone with the boy.

903
01:11:35,423 --> 01:11:38,483
And then you and your wife
could join us later.

904
01:11:44,565 --> 01:11:48,126
No, I'd like to see Little Bob
through this thing myself.

905
01:11:48,469 --> 01:11:50,130
It'd be okay, Dad.

906
01:11:56,610 --> 01:12:00,307
It is pageant week.
Unbelievable amounts of work down there.

907
01:12:00,381 --> 01:12:02,246
No rest for the weary.

908
01:12:04,385 --> 01:12:05,875
I understand.

909
01:12:06,153 --> 01:12:09,520
Well, you run on,
and we'll see you in a couple of sessions.

910
01:12:11,158 --> 01:12:12,819
That'd be just super.

911
01:12:12,893 --> 01:12:16,829
How about you, son? You gonna be able
to get to school on your own, are you then?

912
01:12:16,897 --> 01:12:19,695
- I do it every day.
- Right.

913
01:12:20,634 --> 01:12:22,602
Independent little guy.

914
01:12:24,972 --> 01:12:26,530
Nice to meet you.

915
01:12:27,274 --> 01:12:30,835
Son, you pay attention to this man now.
He is a doctor.

916
01:12:41,689 --> 01:12:44,487
Hi, Blanche. How about some coffee
and a glazed doughnut?

917
01:12:44,558 --> 01:12:47,391
And don't charge me for the hole, Blanche.

918
01:12:48,863 --> 01:12:51,957
They told me at the shop that you'd be here.

919
01:12:52,033 --> 01:12:54,968
- Having a second breakfast there?
- First.

920
01:12:55,703 --> 01:13:00,402
I just wanted to make sure you were coming
to the Exhausted Rooster Ceremony tonight.

921
01:13:00,941 --> 01:13:02,306
I don't think so, Bob.

922
01:13:02,376 --> 01:13:04,867
Come on, Andy.
The guys are really counting on you.

923
01:13:04,945 --> 01:13:07,243
Look, I told you I just don't feel...

924
01:13:07,314 --> 01:13:10,147
Thank you, my dear. Quick as ever.

925
01:13:14,288 --> 01:13:17,780
Look, I told you I just don't feel like
kissing a dead chicken's ass.

926
01:13:17,858 --> 01:13:21,885
Come on, Andy. It's a snap. Like that.

927
01:13:22,129 --> 01:13:24,893
Besides, I'm an Exalted Exhausted Rooster.

928
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:27,793
I'll be standing right next to you
with my sheet on.

929
01:13:27,868 --> 01:13:29,392
There's nothing to it.

930
01:13:29,470 --> 01:13:34,100
You're looking at a man who's seen
as many chickens' asses as another chicken.

931
01:13:36,043 --> 01:13:37,635
How about a bib?

932
01:13:38,746 --> 01:13:42,580
Besides, I shouldn't have to remind
an old guzzler like you...

933
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:45,844
of the amounts of old boozzola
that'll be there.

934
01:13:47,988 --> 01:13:50,718
I'm getting a reputation
for being a drunk, aren't I?

935
01:13:50,791 --> 01:13:52,782
- No, you certainly are not.
- It's true.

936
01:13:52,860 --> 01:13:55,055
- No, it's not true.
- It's true.

937
01:13:57,064 --> 01:14:00,966
First I was drinking a little,
then I was drinking a lot.

938
01:14:03,170 --> 01:14:07,231
Damn, it sure sneaks up on you.
I just sort of slid into it.

939
01:14:08,909 --> 01:14:11,844
That's one thing I'm awful good at. Sliding.

940
01:14:14,115 --> 01:14:18,279
I'm having problems with Brenda.
Sexual problems.

941
01:14:19,820 --> 01:14:23,256
No, thank you, dear. We're fine.
Just fine, thank you.

942
01:14:25,693 --> 01:14:27,820
You're not having any problems.

943
01:14:27,895 --> 01:14:29,362
She's frigid.

944
01:14:31,265 --> 01:14:33,529
That's why I started drinking.

945
01:14:34,301 --> 01:14:36,292
She says it's my fault...

946
01:14:41,142 --> 01:14:43,702
She says my drinking turned her off.

947
01:14:43,978 --> 01:14:47,141
I've been drinking so much,
I don't know what the truth is anymore.

948
01:14:47,214 --> 01:14:50,479
Then it doesn't matter
one whole hell of a lot, does it?

949
01:14:50,551 --> 01:14:54,954
You're gonna have to start pulling yourself
together and quit moping around, here.

950
01:14:55,022 --> 01:14:58,423
Seriously, you got to get out there
and start having some fun.

951
01:14:58,492 --> 01:15:01,518
You can get headaches
sitting around here trying to figure out...

952
01:15:01,595 --> 01:15:04,428
which came first: the chicken or the egg.

953
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:08,400
Speaking of chickens...

954
01:15:09,670 --> 01:15:13,629
I know a place where we can have,
this very night, some real...

955
01:15:14,975 --> 01:15:15,964
fun.

956
01:15:18,412 --> 01:15:22,178
All right, I'll go to the ceremony.

957
01:15:22,917 --> 01:15:24,145
Swell.

958
01:15:24,785 --> 01:15:27,310
You sure are one hell of a salesman.

959
01:15:28,022 --> 01:15:29,421
I better be.

960
01:15:33,327 --> 01:15:36,819
I heard about Little Bob.
I really am sorry about that.

961
01:15:37,731 --> 01:15:41,223
Those things happen. We'll have Little Bob
straightened out in no time...

962
01:15:41,302 --> 01:15:43,133
and right back on the right track.

963
01:15:43,204 --> 01:15:45,729
Doesn't anything ever get you down?

964
01:15:46,073 --> 01:15:48,871
Yeah, I get my apple cart upset sometimes.

965
01:15:49,109 --> 01:15:53,773
I just learned a long time ago
to accept a little less from life, that's all.

966
01:15:58,519 --> 01:16:01,886
Want to know who taught me
this great lesson in life?

967
01:16:02,623 --> 01:16:04,250
Elizabeth Taylor.

968
01:16:04,625 --> 01:16:05,751
What?

969
01:16:07,461 --> 01:16:12,125
I never bothered to tell you the story
because I don't believe in negative stories...

970
01:16:12,900 --> 01:16:16,427
but one time I actually had a date
with old Liz herself.

971
01:16:16,770 --> 01:16:18,260
You're kidding.

972
01:16:20,507 --> 01:16:24,466
Do you remember when I went off
to junior college in Los Angeles?

973
01:16:24,645 --> 01:16:27,614
I had a class with a guy
that was Liz Taylor's cousin.

974
01:16:27,681 --> 01:16:29,649
He fixed me up with her.

975
01:16:29,717 --> 01:16:32,618
- What was she like?
- I never met her.

976
01:16:33,420 --> 01:16:37,220
- You just said...
- No, I just said that I had a date with her.

977
01:16:37,291 --> 01:16:39,555
I never said that she kept it.

978
01:16:42,596 --> 01:16:45,531
You should've seen
all the preparations I made.

979
01:16:45,599 --> 01:16:48,864
I went out and got the best flowers
that I could find...

980
01:16:48,936 --> 01:16:52,497
and a great table at the
world-famous Cocoanut Grove restaurant.

981
01:16:53,807 --> 01:16:55,968
And then she never showed up.

982
01:16:56,744 --> 01:17:00,612
That was the weekend that she ran off
and married the hotel guy.

983
01:17:01,649 --> 01:17:03,014
I'm sorry.

984
01:17:03,083 --> 01:17:05,244
You don't have to be sorry.

985
01:17:05,319 --> 01:17:09,119
Just that now I'm married to Roberta,
and I'm happy about it.

986
01:17:12,626 --> 01:17:16,460
Even though she is
a little less than Elizabeth Taylor.

987
01:17:21,902 --> 01:17:24,200
God, Elizabeth Taylor was beautiful.

988
01:17:26,940 --> 01:17:29,807
...and that girl had a wooden foot.

989
01:17:31,578 --> 01:17:35,344
And now, as we begin
the Creative Talent Division on this...

990
01:17:35,416 --> 01:17:39,375
the Final Preliminary night
before the Final Big Show, tomorrow night...

991
01:17:39,453 --> 01:17:43,116
when, at last,
our new California Young American Miss...

992
01:17:43,190 --> 01:17:46,250
will finally be chosen
right here on this stage...

993
01:17:46,327 --> 01:17:49,228
in a burst of tears and laughter and glory.

994
01:17:52,599 --> 01:17:53,998
But first...

995
01:17:54,868 --> 01:17:59,032
I'd just like to say a word
about how these girls have affected me...

996
01:17:59,506 --> 01:18:00,837
personally.

997
01:18:00,908 --> 01:18:04,173
Not Ted Farley, the smooth entertainer
that you see here before you...

998
01:18:04,244 --> 01:18:06,144
but Ted Farley, the man.

999
01:18:06,213 --> 01:18:08,977
- Maria, could you hook this, please?
- I'm on in a second.

1000
01:18:09,049 --> 01:18:11,677
- It's the top one.
- Here, let me do it for you.

1001
01:18:11,752 --> 01:18:15,188
...not only to me, but to everybody
who has participated in the pageant.

1002
01:18:15,255 --> 01:18:17,689
Even Ray Brandy
and all the guys in the band.

1003
01:18:17,758 --> 01:18:20,921
The lack of competitiveness
and the genuine desire of each girl...

1004
01:18:20,994 --> 01:18:23,053
I do this. It's fine, I started it. It's okay.

1005
01:18:23,130 --> 01:18:26,964
Just another example of what makes
America the place I'm proud to be a part of.

1006
01:18:27,034 --> 01:18:30,492
Aba daba daba daba daba daba daba
Said the monkey to the chimp

1007
01:18:30,571 --> 01:18:34,063
All night long, they'd chatter away
All day long they're happy and gay

1008
01:18:34,141 --> 01:18:37,406
Swingin' and singin' in a honky-tonky way

1009
01:18:51,024 --> 01:18:53,219
And for that very special wool jacket...

1010
01:18:53,293 --> 01:18:57,423
there's still good old tissue paper
to help keep out nasty creases.

1011
01:18:58,766 --> 01:19:00,529
And one final tip, girls.

1012
01:19:23,757 --> 01:19:28,091
And so these great nations
have gone speeding through history.

1013
01:19:28,362 --> 01:19:32,662
Brown friends and white friends,
reaching out to the skies...

1014
01:19:32,733 --> 01:19:35,031
in heavenly harmony!

1015
01:20:29,556 --> 01:20:33,458
Hey, Big Bob! Good to see you.
How are you?

1016
01:20:33,527 --> 01:20:35,222
Help me with my sheet, here.

1017
01:20:35,295 --> 01:20:37,786
Where's somebody go
to wet their whistle around here?

1018
01:20:37,865 --> 01:20:40,265
- Al, son of a gun.
- Let's get a beer. Come on.

1019
01:20:40,334 --> 01:20:43,428
Hey, Pancho! How are you?

1020
01:20:48,208 --> 01:20:51,769
Look, isn't that the saddest looking bunch
of Exhausted Rooster Candidates?

1021
01:20:51,845 --> 01:20:55,679
Haven't I told you every year
they get more exhausted looking?

1022
01:20:56,517 --> 01:20:59,816
- Here, have a beer.
- How the hell are you, Big Bob?

1023
01:21:03,457 --> 01:21:04,788
Peel that.

1024
01:21:09,062 --> 01:21:11,292
You missed out on a lot of fun.
Where've you been?

1025
01:21:11,365 --> 01:21:15,461
- Had a little trouble with the pageant.
- Good. I'll drink to that.

1026
01:21:15,536 --> 01:21:18,630
That's not funny.
Some poor girl's act was ruined.

1027
01:21:18,705 --> 01:21:21,731
Our first Mexican-American entry
claims her act was sabotaged.

1028
01:21:21,808 --> 01:21:24,436
- I hardly believe that.
- I hope that's not true.

1029
01:21:24,511 --> 01:21:26,445
Our club has spent
a lot of time and money...

1030
01:21:26,513 --> 01:21:29,539
trying to help these young people
become responsible adults.

1031
01:21:30,384 --> 01:21:32,147
I'll barbecue your ass!

1032
01:21:37,090 --> 01:21:39,752
Didn't I tell you it was gonna be fun?

1033
01:21:40,460 --> 01:21:45,227
Didn't I tell you, as our friends south
of the border would say, "Dos pelotas!"

1034
01:23:48,321 --> 01:23:50,186
I love it!

1035
01:23:57,264 --> 01:23:58,663
Come on.

1036
01:23:59,466 --> 01:24:02,697
- What's wrong?
- Come on, Andy, be a man.

1037
01:24:39,206 --> 01:24:42,698
If Wilson can't get to the bottom of it,
I'll get into it myself tomorrow.

1038
01:24:42,776 --> 01:24:46,109
I've got to hang up now.
Yeah, I'll talk to you tomorrow. Bye-bye.

1039
01:24:46,179 --> 01:24:49,205
Andy, I just had the rug shampooed.

1040
01:24:53,286 --> 01:24:54,878
Piss on the rug.

1041
01:24:58,091 --> 01:24:59,558
You're drunk.

1042
01:25:09,903 --> 01:25:11,564
What's the matter?

1043
01:25:12,439 --> 01:25:14,236
I think I'm going crazy.

1044
01:25:18,145 --> 01:25:20,613
Now, that's a stupid thing to say.

1045
01:25:21,047 --> 01:25:22,708
I was in the park.

1046
01:25:22,983 --> 01:25:25,315
Grown men horsing around in sheets.

1047
01:25:25,385 --> 01:25:29,253
Big Bob grinning at me through his hood.
Either they're crazy or I'm crazy!

1048
01:25:29,322 --> 01:25:31,620
Did Big Bob tell you
what happened at the pageant...

1049
01:25:31,691 --> 01:25:35,127
- I don't give a damn about that pageant!
- Go ahead!

1050
01:25:36,163 --> 01:25:39,132
I'm used to having trouble with things I do.

1051
01:25:39,366 --> 01:25:41,596
But I'm going to go right on doing them!

1052
01:25:41,668 --> 01:25:46,230
You have to do something with your time
when you're married to the town drunk.

1053
01:26:05,091 --> 01:26:07,582
You won't let me make up, will you?

1054
01:26:08,795 --> 01:26:11,662
Brenda, that's what we're supposed to do,
comfort each other.

1055
01:26:11,731 --> 01:26:15,258
- I'm tired!
- Well, I'm tired of your being tired!

1056
01:26:17,437 --> 01:26:19,268
You're crazy!

1057
01:26:19,739 --> 01:26:21,502
I already said that.

1058
01:26:29,783 --> 01:26:31,341
Oh, poor thing.

1059
01:27:02,582 --> 01:27:04,072
Where are you?

1060
01:27:05,785 --> 01:27:09,084
If you're doing anything
to mess up my clean rug...

1061
01:27:16,997 --> 01:27:19,056
Don't worry, I'm standing on the paper.

1062
01:27:19,132 --> 01:27:22,431
- Andy, you can't!
- Quit telling me what to do!

1063
01:27:24,771 --> 01:27:26,932
That's terrific.

1064
01:27:27,407 --> 01:27:30,205
If you've got a problem,
don't try to solve it...

1065
01:27:30,277 --> 01:27:33,337
just take the coward's way out. Coward!

1066
01:27:39,319 --> 01:27:41,014
You're right, Brenda.

1067
01:27:41,087 --> 01:27:45,615
This is the coward's way out.
I should attack my real problem.

1068
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:56,233
Hey, I'm property
of the United States Navy, man.

1069
01:27:56,303 --> 01:27:58,032
I don't belong here.

1070
01:27:58,104 --> 01:28:00,095
I want to see a psychiatrist.

1071
01:28:00,173 --> 01:28:02,038
- Let me out!
- What do we have here?

1072
01:28:05,345 --> 01:28:06,812
Hey, let me out!

1073
01:28:23,363 --> 01:28:27,527
I guess you heard Brenda's okay.
Just a little nick in the shoulder.

1074
01:28:33,039 --> 01:28:35,007
Sounds of the big house.

1075
01:28:36,376 --> 01:28:38,105
It's a little scary.

1076
01:28:38,445 --> 01:28:40,072
How are you?

1077
01:28:40,880 --> 01:28:44,714
I'm pretty good. I'm pretty damn good.

1078
01:28:46,119 --> 01:28:49,850
Guess you're relieved
Brenda's not pressing charges, though.

1079
01:28:50,991 --> 01:28:52,720
I knew she wouldn't.

1080
01:28:52,792 --> 01:28:56,159
This way she can keep her precious pageant
out of the newspaper.

1081
01:28:56,229 --> 01:28:58,220
Andy, now wait a second.

1082
01:28:58,565 --> 01:29:00,692
I'm your best friend, right?

1083
01:29:01,101 --> 01:29:04,195
First of all, I don't think
you're being fair to the little lady.

1084
01:29:04,270 --> 01:29:08,764
Seriously, she's been an enormous help
to me throughout this whole thing.

1085
01:29:09,509 --> 01:29:12,103
You know the biggest thing
you could do for me?

1086
01:29:12,178 --> 01:29:15,807
- Don't always be knocking the pageant.
- Screw the pageant!

1087
01:29:18,885 --> 01:29:21,319
What am I supposed to say to that?

1088
01:29:22,956 --> 01:29:24,253
I'm sorry.

1089
01:29:26,826 --> 01:29:30,387
- You going to work today?
- Hell, no!

1090
01:29:31,998 --> 01:29:33,898
What are you gonna do?

1091
01:29:34,567 --> 01:29:36,660
You'll be out of here soon.

1092
01:29:38,772 --> 01:29:40,603
I don't know exactly.

1093
01:29:41,841 --> 01:29:44,674
- I'll probably leave Santa Rosa...
- Oh, no.

1094
01:29:47,247 --> 01:29:49,477
You got to stay in Santa Rosa, Andy.

1095
01:29:49,549 --> 01:29:52,279
You can lick your problems,
right here in your own backyard.

1096
01:29:52,352 --> 01:29:53,819
Who wants to?

1097
01:29:54,654 --> 01:29:58,055
Andy, it's very simple.
All it takes is a drop more perseverance...

1098
01:29:58,124 --> 01:30:01,025
a drop more optimism,
and a drop more energy.

1099
01:30:01,461 --> 01:30:02,689
Simple.

1100
01:30:05,498 --> 01:30:07,261
Hey, wait a minute.

1101
01:30:08,935 --> 01:30:10,869
I've heard that before.

1102
01:30:11,137 --> 01:30:13,901
- Heard what before?
- That drip-drop crap.

1103
01:30:14,474 --> 01:30:16,374
Brenda read that to me.

1104
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:20,609
That's right out of
the Young American Miss program.

1105
01:30:20,680 --> 01:30:22,875
A good philosophy is good philosophy.

1106
01:30:22,949 --> 01:30:25,577
And I don't happen to be a snob
about where I get it from.

1107
01:30:25,652 --> 01:30:28,883
I can tell you another thing,
as your best friend talking to you...

1108
01:30:28,955 --> 01:30:32,118
quit wallowing around
in all this self-indulgent self-pity...

1109
01:30:32,192 --> 01:30:35,059
and get out there and start helping others.

1110
01:30:42,235 --> 01:30:44,760
I've finally figured out what you are.

1111
01:30:45,004 --> 01:30:46,767
You know what you are?

1112
01:30:46,840 --> 01:30:49,741
A goddamn Young American Miss.

1113
01:30:56,683 --> 01:30:58,981
Okay, we got the list down to 10.

1114
01:30:59,519 --> 01:31:02,420
- All excellent choices.
- All wonderful girls.

1115
01:31:02,489 --> 01:31:05,549
- They sure are. Now, let's drop five.
- Right.

1116
01:31:05,992 --> 01:31:07,289
We could drop her.

1117
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:09,954
You really hate jelly jars, don't you, Father?

1118
01:31:10,029 --> 01:31:13,055
- Not as a container for jelly.
- This isn't getting us home.

1119
01:31:13,133 --> 01:31:14,896
Okay, you're right.

1120
01:31:14,968 --> 01:31:19,132
I think we've all lost our way a little here.
Let's go back to basics.

1121
01:31:19,205 --> 01:31:21,435
It's all right here in the judges' manual.

1122
01:31:21,508 --> 01:31:25,342
Let's remind ourselves of the qualities
we are asked to find in the winner.

1123
01:31:25,411 --> 01:31:27,971
A Young American Miss must be cheerful...

1124
01:31:28,047 --> 01:31:32,484
perseverant, sincere,
show a genuine concern for others.

1125
01:31:32,552 --> 01:31:35,350
Right. And those aren't bad things to be.

1126
01:31:37,490 --> 01:31:38,752
Are they?

1127
01:31:39,626 --> 01:31:42,060
Look, the deal was $2,000. I want my money.

1128
01:31:42,128 --> 01:31:45,564
You'll get your money as soon as
you take out that ramp you put in first.

1129
01:31:45,632 --> 01:31:47,964
God damn it, I told you I can't do that now!

1130
01:31:48,034 --> 01:31:50,468
Mr. French, I expect you
to be reasonable about this.

1131
01:31:50,537 --> 01:31:54,337
You are a professional. The Jaycees
never really planned on that ramp.

1132
01:31:54,407 --> 01:31:55,840
But you approved it.

1133
01:31:55,909 --> 01:32:00,005
We didn't realize it was going to eliminate
so many seats from our Golden Circle.

1134
01:32:00,079 --> 01:32:01,546
What Golden Circle?

1135
01:32:01,614 --> 01:32:05,345
The golden chairs that go right here,
where your ramp is now.

1136
01:32:05,885 --> 01:32:08,513
We always put them in on the final night.

1137
01:32:08,621 --> 01:32:11,647
And as it is now,
they're already all sold out for $10 a head.

1138
01:32:11,724 --> 01:32:16,320
Now, if you need the ramp in here,
it means that we're out 50 chairs and $500.

1139
01:32:16,396 --> 01:32:19,388
I sympathize with your problem,
but you should've told me sooner.

1140
01:32:19,465 --> 01:32:21,933
There's nothing I can do about it now.

1141
01:32:22,001 --> 01:32:24,663
Yes, there is. You can take out the ramp.

1142
01:32:24,737 --> 01:32:26,500
If I take that ramp out now...

1143
01:32:26,573 --> 01:32:30,669
I will have to completely restage
all the numbers in one afternoon.

1144
01:32:31,077 --> 01:32:32,635
Is that so hard?

1145
01:32:32,712 --> 01:32:36,842
These girls are not Ginger Rogers.
They dance more like Roy Rogers.

1146
01:32:36,916 --> 01:32:39,749
I'd hoped you thought a little more
of our girls than that.

1147
01:32:39,819 --> 01:32:41,480
Don't give me that sanctimonious shit!

1148
01:32:41,554 --> 01:32:44,318
You're the one
that doesn't give a goddamn about the girls.

1149
01:32:44,390 --> 01:32:48,224
If I take that ramp out now,
they'll fall all over themselves.

1150
01:32:48,294 --> 01:32:51,229
The finance committee
did come up with another idea...

1151
01:32:51,297 --> 01:32:53,959
but I don't think you're gonna like it.

1152
01:32:54,033 --> 01:32:55,295
Try me.

1153
01:32:56,903 --> 01:32:59,337
How would you feel
about picking up the tab...

1154
01:32:59,405 --> 01:33:02,966
for the amount we lose
because of your ramp being there?

1155
01:33:03,810 --> 01:33:07,405
It means we would deduct
$500 from your check.

1156
01:33:08,014 --> 01:33:09,345
How would you feel...

1157
01:33:09,415 --> 01:33:12,851
about having the whole pageant
shoved up your ass, bamboo poles and all?

1158
01:33:12,919 --> 01:33:16,355
Now see here, Mr. French,
I'm trying to be reasonable about this.

1159
01:33:16,422 --> 01:33:21,086
Our Jaycee chapter is almost bankrupt
because of this meat show!

1160
01:33:23,630 --> 01:33:28,067
If we don't break even, we'll have to cancel
the Rodeo for the Retarded.

1161
01:33:30,670 --> 01:33:34,470
Surely $500 can't mean that much
to a Hollywood professional.

1162
01:33:34,674 --> 01:33:38,235
And one, two, three, four.

1163
01:33:38,578 --> 01:33:41,809
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, turn!

1164
01:33:42,048 --> 01:33:45,381
One, two, three, four...

1165
01:33:45,485 --> 01:33:48,579
five, six, seven, eight.

1166
01:33:50,423 --> 01:33:51,685
Hold it!

1167
01:33:53,926 --> 01:33:55,689
Get rid of the ramp.

1168
01:33:56,896 --> 01:34:00,491
Now, ladies, pay attention.
We've got a lot of work to do.

1169
01:34:00,566 --> 01:34:04,161
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!

1170
01:34:04,237 --> 01:34:07,365
Me ol' bam-boo
You better never bother with me ol' bam-boo

1171
01:34:07,440 --> 01:34:09,431
You can have me hat or me bumber-shoot

1172
01:34:09,509 --> 01:34:12,171
But you better never bother
with me ol' bam-boo

1173
01:34:16,249 --> 01:34:19,184
- Mr. French, are you busy?
- Yeah.

1174
01:34:19,252 --> 01:34:23,848
I'd just like to ask you one question
about my daughter, Celia Parks?

1175
01:34:24,557 --> 01:34:26,889
The one who sang I Feel Pretty.

1176
01:34:27,560 --> 01:34:32,259
I just wanted to know if you think
she has a future as a professional singer.

1177
01:34:33,366 --> 01:34:35,857
Not unless Florence Henderson dies.

1178
01:34:54,287 --> 01:34:58,553
We feel we are not doing these new routines
as well without the ramp.

1179
01:35:04,063 --> 01:35:07,260
We were just wondering
why we can't have the ramp.

1180
01:35:08,968 --> 01:35:10,629
Because I said so.

1181
01:35:27,353 --> 01:35:28,786
Was there something else?

1182
01:35:28,855 --> 01:35:31,653
We'll never be as good without the ramp.
It just isn't fair!

1183
01:35:31,724 --> 01:35:33,658
Few things in life are.

1184
01:35:35,595 --> 01:35:39,031
I've been working so hard all week.
Vim and Vigor is my best event.

1185
01:35:39,098 --> 01:35:41,999
I've won the preliminaries,
and I was counting on that ramp...

1186
01:35:42,068 --> 01:35:45,060
Hold it a minute!
Are you speaking for the group now?

1187
01:35:46,305 --> 01:35:49,570
Because if you are,
you're sure using the word "l" a lot.

1188
01:35:49,642 --> 01:35:52,202
No, I guess I'm speaking for myself.

1189
01:35:52,645 --> 01:35:56,081
Then here's an answer, just for you:
The ramp is out!

1190
01:35:58,317 --> 01:36:00,683
Sixteen, seventeen, eighteen,
nineteen, twenty!

1191
01:36:00,753 --> 01:36:03,950
Me ol' bam-boo
You better never bother with me ol' bam-boo

1192
01:36:04,023 --> 01:36:05,957
You can have me hat or me bumber-shoot

1193
01:36:06,025 --> 01:36:11,429
But you better never bother
with me ol' bam-boo

1194
01:36:17,804 --> 01:36:21,570
And one, two, and turn!

1195
01:36:28,948 --> 01:36:30,745
Easy.

1196
01:36:32,318 --> 01:36:34,115
- Are you all right?
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1197
01:36:34,187 --> 01:36:35,620
What happened?

1198
01:36:35,688 --> 01:36:38,851
I should have gone left
instead of straight ahead.

1199
01:36:39,091 --> 01:36:41,855
I flunked Driver's Ed for the same thing.

1200
01:36:52,405 --> 01:36:54,100
Put back the ramp.

1201
01:36:57,910 --> 01:37:01,209
You win, you little toad bastard!
I want the $1,500 tonight!

1202
01:37:01,280 --> 01:37:03,840
And if Miss Anaheim
is not smart enough to sue you...

1203
01:37:03,916 --> 01:37:07,750
I will personally introduce her
to a nice lawyer who is not a Jaycee.

1204
01:37:12,525 --> 01:37:15,585
- No, listen, I'm going to soak it.
- Are you all right, darling?

1205
01:37:15,661 --> 01:37:18,095
Can I get you anything, a doctor, a Pepsi?

1206
01:37:30,710 --> 01:37:32,940
Wait, let me help you.

1207
01:37:33,579 --> 01:37:37,481
- Please don't make such a fuss, dear.
- I'm fine. I'm absolutely fine.

1208
01:37:37,550 --> 01:37:39,916
- Hello, Earl. How are you tonight?
- See you inside.

1209
01:37:39,986 --> 01:37:42,386
- Doesn't it hurt?
- It's not important.

1210
01:37:42,455 --> 01:37:46,619
Please remember I simply slipped
and sprained my arm. That's all.

1211
01:37:46,692 --> 01:37:50,822
Yeah, but I think you're being too good
to that bastard by keeping this thing quiet.

1212
01:37:50,897 --> 01:37:54,492
If Gary took a shot at me,
I'd make sure it was on the front page.

1213
01:37:54,567 --> 01:37:56,694
Why are you protecting him?

1214
01:37:57,703 --> 01:38:01,366
It's not for Andy. It's for the girls.

1215
01:38:02,742 --> 01:38:05,609
He's lucky to be leaving someone like you.

1216
01:38:10,182 --> 01:38:12,082
How do you feel? How's your knee?

1217
01:38:12,151 --> 01:38:15,018
The knee's okay, but I'm so nervous.

1218
01:38:15,821 --> 01:38:18,847
I mean, I'm starting to feel
like I wanna win again, you know?

1219
01:38:18,925 --> 01:38:21,291
Yeah. It's a hard feeling to get rid of,
isn't it?

1220
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:22,349
Right.

1221
01:38:23,629 --> 01:38:26,564
Sometimes I feel like I could win, you know?

1222
01:38:27,099 --> 01:38:29,397
Then I get mad at myself for wanting to...

1223
01:38:29,468 --> 01:38:33,370
and then I get mad at myself
for being dumb enough to think that I could.

1224
01:38:33,439 --> 01:38:35,464
Yeah, I feel the same way.

1225
01:38:35,541 --> 01:38:36,803
I want to win so bad.

1226
01:38:52,992 --> 01:38:55,017
Big Bob. How are we doing?

1227
01:38:58,431 --> 01:39:00,262
- How are we doing?
- Yeah.

1228
01:39:00,833 --> 01:39:02,926
Oh, we're doing great, Wilson.

1229
01:39:03,002 --> 01:39:07,098
We are doing just great.
And a hell of job by you this year.

1230
01:39:11,944 --> 01:39:14,276
It's show time!

1231
01:39:18,918 --> 01:39:22,217
And to shine over
this great and fabulous evening...

1232
01:39:22,288 --> 01:39:24,984
Old Glory carried with honor...

1233
01:39:25,057 --> 01:39:28,390
by the Santa Rosa
Marine Auxiliary Color Guard.

1234
01:39:28,461 --> 01:39:31,760
Three strong Americans
who keep America strong.

1235
01:39:59,859 --> 01:40:02,828
And with their symbolic rose of friendship...

1236
01:40:03,062 --> 01:40:05,462
each of our girls bids adieu...

1237
01:40:05,798 --> 01:40:09,165
to the reigning Young American Miss,
Jo Ann Marshall.

1238
01:40:33,025 --> 01:40:36,927
Goodbye, Jo Ann.
Goodbye, Young American Miss.

1239
01:40:51,210 --> 01:40:53,872
There they go,
ladies and gentlemen, the judges.

1240
01:40:53,946 --> 01:40:57,006
And frankly, I don't envy them one little bit.

1241
01:40:57,116 --> 01:41:00,984
They have already done the impossible
by selecting the five most wonderful...

1242
01:41:01,754 --> 01:41:04,814
To entertain you
while our judges deliberate...

1243
01:41:05,458 --> 01:41:09,189
those truly grand
and truly glorious has-beens...

1244
01:41:09,261 --> 01:41:10,751
have worked up a little number.

1245
01:41:10,830 --> 01:41:13,822
You'll enjoy this. Let's bring them on
with a round of applause.

1246
01:41:13,899 --> 01:41:16,424
Ladies and gentlemen, our has-beens.

1247
01:41:38,891 --> 01:41:40,586
Thank you, Jo Ann.

1248
01:41:41,260 --> 01:41:43,626
Here it is, ladies and gentlemen.

1249
01:41:44,196 --> 01:41:48,189
I sometimes wonder how those astronauts
handle all that pressure.

1250
01:41:49,335 --> 01:41:52,827
And our fourth runner-up,
ladies and gentlemen...

1251
01:42:06,986 --> 01:42:10,615
Miss Anaheim, Doria Houston!

1252
01:42:11,657 --> 01:42:15,286
Anaheim's own Doria Houston!

1253
01:42:30,442 --> 01:42:33,502
And our third runner-up. ;

1254
01:42:39,518 --> 01:42:42,919
Miss Fresno, Leslie Anderson!

1255
01:42:49,895 --> 01:42:53,228
And here it is, our second runner-up.

1256
01:42:54,867 --> 01:42:56,801
What an exciting night.

1257
01:42:58,504 --> 01:43:01,837
Miss Modesto, Judy Wagner!

1258
01:43:02,208 --> 01:43:05,939
Modesto's own Judy Wagner!

1259
01:43:17,790 --> 01:43:20,987
And now, it's time for the first runner-up.

1260
01:43:21,393 --> 01:43:24,055
And remember, ladies and gentlemen...

1261
01:43:24,330 --> 01:43:29,029
that if for any reason our California
Young American Miss selected tonight...

1262
01:43:29,602 --> 01:43:32,571
is unable to fulfill her responsibilities...

1263
01:43:32,638 --> 01:43:35,835
this is the girl that would take her place.

1264
01:43:37,376 --> 01:43:39,173
Our first runner-up. ;

1265
01:43:45,417 --> 01:43:48,511
Greater Dinuba, Nancy Hess!

1266
01:43:48,854 --> 01:43:51,448
Nancy Hess from Greater Dinuba!

1267
01:44:02,001 --> 01:44:06,335
And now, here it is, that special moment
that we've worked all week toward.

1268
01:44:06,405 --> 01:44:09,568
I don't mind telling you,
hairs are standing on end.

1269
01:44:09,642 --> 01:44:11,200
And remember...

1270
01:44:12,578 --> 01:44:15,308
there are no winners and losers here...

1271
01:44:16,215 --> 01:44:19,742
because each of our girls is a winner.

1272
01:44:20,619 --> 01:44:23,588
But if there ever was a winner,
this would be it.

1273
01:44:24,390 --> 01:44:27,882
This is the gal to beat
in Baton Rouge, Louisiana...

1274
01:44:28,327 --> 01:44:32,161
our new California Young American Miss.

1275
01:44:44,810 --> 01:44:48,143
Fountain Valley, Shawn Christianson!

1276
01:44:48,280 --> 01:44:52,376
Miss Fountain Valley, Shawn Christianson!

1277
01:45:29,922 --> 01:45:32,390
Once she held her tears inside...

1278
01:45:32,558 --> 01:45:35,152
but now there's nothing left to hide.

1279
01:45:36,095 --> 01:45:39,963
An all-American girl you see

1280
01:45:40,032 --> 01:45:43,195
She's all an American girl should be

1281
01:45:43,268 --> 01:45:46,533
With an inner beauty she shines bright

1282
01:45:46,605 --> 01:45:49,699
With a sense of duty here tonight

1283
01:45:49,775 --> 01:45:52,938
She'll wear her crown with love and respect

1284
01:45:53,012 --> 01:45:57,415
She's our Young American girl elect

1285
01:45:57,950 --> 01:46:02,478
An all-American girl you see

1286
01:46:02,988 --> 01:46:08,824
She's all an American girl should be

1287
01:46:21,974 --> 01:46:23,965
There she is, ladies and gentlemen...

1288
01:46:24,043 --> 01:46:28,639
California's new Young American Miss,
Shawn Christianson.

1289
01:46:29,415 --> 01:46:31,042
Isn't she lovely?

1290
01:46:31,116 --> 01:46:33,050
Aren't they all lovely?

1291
01:46:33,252 --> 01:46:35,117
Isn't everyone lovely?

1292
01:46:43,695 --> 01:46:46,255
Our thanks to all of our lovely contestants...

1293
01:46:46,331 --> 01:46:49,789
the great work done by the Jaycees,
our fabulously unique judges...

1294
01:46:49,868 --> 01:46:54,271
of course, the fantastic orchestra
under the supervision of Ray Brandy...

1295
01:46:54,339 --> 01:46:58,776
our stupendous director, the superb
Hollywood professional, Mr. Tommy French.

1296
01:46:59,211 --> 01:47:01,236
And, of course, our miraculous stage crew.

1297
01:47:01,313 --> 01:47:05,079
Mostly, thank you, ladies and gentlemen,
for making it such a great evening.

1298
01:47:05,150 --> 01:47:07,618
Thank you and good night.
See you next year!

1299
01:47:40,052 --> 01:47:41,212
Doria!

1300
01:47:49,661 --> 01:47:52,687
Robin, I wanted you to win, too.

1301
01:47:54,333 --> 01:47:56,494
Maybe I'm not an opportunist.

1302
01:47:56,902 --> 01:48:01,066
Listen, Doria, don't worry about it.
I'm just glad it's over.

1303
01:48:01,473 --> 01:48:02,735
No shit.

1304
01:48:06,245 --> 01:48:07,439
Momma!

1305
01:48:11,583 --> 01:48:13,483
I'm so glad to see you.

1306
01:48:36,875 --> 01:48:39,105
Are you done with this stuff?

1307
01:48:40,546 --> 01:48:43,037
- Excuse me?
- I throw it away.

1308
01:48:44,249 --> 01:48:46,683
Go ahead, throw it away. Thank you.

1309
01:48:49,254 --> 01:48:51,381
Front and center, two!

1310
01:48:56,995 --> 01:48:58,826
Forward, two!

1311
01:49:01,200 --> 01:49:02,963
Detail, halt.

1312
01:49:05,003 --> 01:49:06,402
Order, two!

1313
01:49:08,140 --> 01:49:09,368
At ease.

1314
01:49:23,188 --> 01:49:24,849
Keep them tight. Roll them up.

1315
01:49:24,923 --> 01:49:27,221
- Hiya, fellas.
- How you doing?

1316
01:49:27,893 --> 01:49:30,885
You guys sure did a super job tonight.
Thank you.

1317
01:49:30,963 --> 01:49:33,329
Thank you. Watch the flag, Gene.

1318
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:37,368
The First Division, huh?

1319
01:49:37,603 --> 01:49:38,865
Yes, sir.

1320
01:49:40,439 --> 01:49:41,929
Roll in tight.

1321
01:49:42,474 --> 01:49:44,635
I was in the First Division.

1322
01:49:44,710 --> 01:49:46,837
Watch your flag there, Gene.

1323
01:49:46,912 --> 01:49:49,107
We held the Josane Reservoir.

1324
01:49:49,581 --> 01:49:51,742
Did you see the knockers
on Miss lmperial County?

1325
01:49:51,817 --> 01:49:54,718
- Yeah, both of them.

Have a balloon here, Dad.
