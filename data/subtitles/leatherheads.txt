3
00:01:28,857 --> 00:01:30,137
Hey, Carter, one more year
and you graduate.

4
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:32,025
- What's waiting for you out there?
- Don't know, Nate.

5
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,816
Get a job, make a couple bucks,
maybe even buy your paper.

6
00:01:34,816 --> 00:01:36,734
- Will you miss football?
- Heck, yeah, I'll miss it,

7
00:01:36,734 --> 00:01:38,491
- but what are you gonna do?
- Beats me.

8
00:01:38,575 --> 00:01:41,046
- Nothing much you can do.
- You could always go pro.

9
00:02:55,694 --> 00:02:58,731
You know, Stump,
there are several time-tested methods

10
00:02:58,823 --> 00:03:01,693
for... diverting the defense
from the ball carrier.

11
00:03:01,784 --> 00:03:04,109
Throwing your body in front of them
with a certain amount of force.

12
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:06,077
- What, you mean blocking?
- Sounds kinda rough.

13
00:03:06,163 --> 00:03:08,072
- You know, that could hurt, Dodge.
- Yes, it could.

14
00:03:14,933 --> 00:03:17,088
Frank?
You gotta get me a blocker.

15
00:03:17,174 --> 00:03:18,803
Oh, I've been thinkin'
the same thinkin', Dodge,

16
00:03:18,803 --> 00:03:20,545
and I'm lookin'
at this high school kid over at Penrose.

17
00:03:20,636 --> 00:03:23,462
- High school?
- Yeah, but he's mature for his age.

18
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,670
Like Bug over there?

19
00:03:36,485 --> 00:03:38,993
57, 11...

20
00:04:09,143 --> 00:04:12,509
No, forget the water bucket, Bug.
Go... and get that ball!

21
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,850
It's the only ball we got.

22
00:04:23,074 --> 00:04:24,404
Get rid of it.

23
00:04:36,963 --> 00:04:38,385
- We're down to the third?
- Yeah.

24
00:04:39,437 --> 00:04:40,799
Let's give them Rin Tin Tin.

25
00:05:35,522 --> 00:05:37,100
Okay, coach,
we need another ball.

26
00:05:37,274 --> 00:05:40,061
Well, ask them other fellas, why don't you?
That's the only ball we have.

27
00:05:40,152 --> 00:05:43,283
Well, then, you better find another one,
and fast, or you're gonna have to forfeit.

28
00:05:44,614 --> 00:05:45,666
Forfeit?

29
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:49,025
- We're creaming these mutts.
- The home team provides the game ball.

30
00:05:49,119 --> 00:05:51,527
You don't have another ball,
you forfeit the game. That's the rules.

31
00:05:51,621 --> 00:05:53,863
- Where's that written?
- It ain't written. It's just the rules.

32
00:05:53,957 --> 00:05:56,415
- Well, I never heard of it.
- Maybe goin' deaf, old man.

33
00:06:23,612 --> 00:06:27,202
Dear, there must be better ways
to promote the starch business.

34
00:06:28,283 --> 00:06:30,029
Tough loss there, Dodge.

35
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:33,826
Hate to end a home stand
like that on a technicality.

36
00:06:34,164 --> 00:06:37,341
- You ever heard o' that rule?
- Me? No. I never heard o' any rules.

37
00:06:37,584 --> 00:06:41,173
My point exactly.
Goddamn rules are ruining the game.

38
00:06:41,839 --> 00:06:43,556
Goddamn rules.

39
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:48,545
Bug, when you're done with the water,
grab my shaving kit from my suitcase.

40
00:06:48,637 --> 00:06:50,630
- Grab your own damn shaving kit!
- For Christ's sake, Frank,

41
00:06:50,723 --> 00:06:52,181
how much can a football cost?

42
00:06:52,266 --> 00:06:53,754
You think footballs are grown
out of thin air?

43
00:06:53,754 --> 00:06:55,636
So, you get a few simoleons
from the Starch King.

44
00:06:55,728 --> 00:06:57,582
Hey, Dodge,
do I feel hot to you?

45
00:06:58,147 --> 00:07:00,472
- No more than the next man.
- Fever runs in my family, you know.

46
00:07:00,608 --> 00:07:03,370
Everything runs in your family, Ralph,
except your feet.

47
00:07:03,618 --> 00:07:06,036
Look what you made...
I have to start again.

48
00:07:06,363 --> 00:07:09,211
Hey, it's no big joke. You'll make us
miss the train to Milwaukee.

49
00:07:09,397 --> 00:07:12,820
- Milwaukee? What about Akron?
- Akron team folded day before yesterday.

50
00:07:12,912 --> 00:07:15,450
- We gonna play Milwaukee instead.
- I can't go to Milwaukee.

51
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:17,448
- I got a wrestling match tonight.
- So, get out of it.

52
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:19,285
- It pays 100 bucks.
- We'll see you when you get back.

53
00:07:19,376 --> 00:07:22,294
- That's okay. I got this kid comin'.
- The high school kid from Penrose?

54
00:07:22,379 --> 00:07:25,131
Yeah. He can only practise after class,
but wait till you see 'im.

55
00:07:25,216 --> 00:07:26,496
- When's 'e comin'?
- He's gonna meet us

56
00:07:26,592 --> 00:07:28,217
at the Waterford station
when the train stops.

57
00:07:28,302 --> 00:07:32,134
- Hey, I got an extra fin coming my way.
- You lost that last game.

58
00:07:32,223 --> 00:07:35,266
I did not. Dodge, didn't I have this tooth
today when we started the game?

59
00:07:35,266 --> 00:07:38,810
Curly, I learned long ago
never to stare directly into your face.

60
00:07:38,896 --> 00:07:40,384
Show me the lost tooth,
I'll give you the 5.

61
00:07:40,384 --> 00:07:42,471
If I had it, it wouldn't be lost.

62
00:07:42,471 --> 00:07:45,562
- Ready, Suds?
- Yeah... Yeah, shoot.

63
00:07:46,487 --> 00:07:48,937
The Duluth Bulldogs
lost to the Toledo Bullets today

64
00:07:48,937 --> 00:07:51,498
in a dirty game
of professional league football,

65
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:55,491
where a new and dangerous element
has been creeping in. Rules.

66
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:58,249
- Goddamn rules.
- The lone moment of glory came...

67
00:08:15,391 --> 00:08:17,099
- Say, Joe.
- Nice hat, Lexie.

68
00:08:17,185 --> 00:08:18,845
Thanks, I just bought it.

69
00:08:18,936 --> 00:08:22,021
Listen, can you get me in a room
with Hank Kelly at the comptroller's desk?

70
00:08:22,106 --> 00:08:25,855
- He won't talk to reporters in fancy hats.
- Hey, Lexie. Goin' huntin'?

71
00:08:25,943 --> 00:08:29,110
It's a very expensive hat.
Your whole year's salary.

72
00:08:29,197 --> 00:08:30,857
Harvey wants to see you
in his office.

73
00:08:30,948 --> 00:08:32,359
I'd take that mack off
before you go in there.

74
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:35,202
- You would, would you?
- He might think there's an air raid.

75
00:08:35,286 --> 00:08:39,450
Ho-ho, good boys, complete sentences.
Next week, let's try paragraphs.

76
00:08:39,707 --> 00:08:43,456
- Say, Pete... See about Hank Kelly, will you?
- He doesn't talk to reporters.

77
00:08:43,544 --> 00:08:45,584
- Say, Harvey.
- Nice piñata.

78
00:08:45,672 --> 00:08:47,664
- Ugh, don't you start.
- Pull up a chair.

79
00:08:47,799 --> 00:08:50,634
Best seat in the house.
Who are you, sarge?

80
00:08:50,718 --> 00:08:52,711
Mack Steiner. Lieutenant.

81
00:08:52,971 --> 00:08:54,631
Lexie, I got one for you.

82
00:08:54,722 --> 00:08:56,715
You ever hear o' Carter Rutherford,
"the Bullet"?

83
00:08:57,058 --> 00:08:59,810
Football boy?
War hero football boy?

84
00:08:59,894 --> 00:09:01,851
Ooh, good-looking war hero football boy.

85
00:09:01,938 --> 00:09:03,978
Took time outta college
to fight the war.

86
00:09:04,065 --> 00:09:06,141
Got a whole platoon of Jerries
to surrender.

87
00:09:06,234 --> 00:09:08,807
Just dropped their guns
and gave up from the sound of his voice.

88
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:11,821
You oughta hire 'im.
Get rid of this pack o' geniuses.

89
00:09:11,906 --> 00:09:13,816
- We're gonna do a story on 'im.
- What's your angle?

90
00:09:13,908 --> 00:09:16,197
- It ain't true.
- It's all a crock.

91
00:09:16,327 --> 00:09:17,987
Kid's on radio shows
and advertisements.

92
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:20,072
He's hired
a promoter named C.C. Frazier

93
00:09:20,165 --> 00:09:21,742
to put 'imself
on the cover of every magazine.

94
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:24,337
- Ooh, I like those razors.
- Sure. Who doesn't?

95
00:09:24,669 --> 00:09:25,995
So, what's the story, Mack?

96
00:09:25,995 --> 00:09:30,037
I served with 'im.
I was there in the Argonne. He ain't no hero.

97
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:33,427
You're gonna meet with Carter and C.C.
He's gonna be in town next month.

98
00:09:33,511 --> 00:09:35,967
And you're gonna do a story
on the virtues of the Bullet.

99
00:09:36,056 --> 00:09:37,666
The many virtues.

100
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:41,734
And then, we're gonna break the myth...
of the War Hero Bullet.

101
00:09:44,606 --> 00:09:47,939
Listen... You got fellas
who'd be perfect for this.

102
00:09:48,026 --> 00:09:50,019
Three Knickerbockers out there,
for instance,

103
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:52,741
who'd trade their high school diplomas
for a crack at it.

104
00:09:52,741 --> 00:09:54,771
- It's not my kinda story.
- Lexie,

105
00:09:54,771 --> 00:09:58,367
C.C. Frazier wants the Chicago Tribune
to do a story on his protégé.

106
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:01,486
We're gonna oblige 'im,
and you're gonna do it.

107
00:10:02,624 --> 00:10:04,486
Can I talk to you alone
for a minute?

108
00:10:05,127 --> 00:10:10,101
- Captain, would you excuse us?
- It's lieutenant. I'll wait in the hall.

109
00:10:14,886 --> 00:10:16,376
Thanks, lieutenant.

110
00:10:22,811 --> 00:10:23,890
Why me?

111
00:10:24,354 --> 00:10:26,062
Because it's a big story
and you're the best.

112
00:10:26,148 --> 00:10:28,555
Thought you'd say
it's cause I have the best legs in the office.

113
00:10:28,650 --> 00:10:29,681
No, Joe does.

114
00:10:31,236 --> 00:10:33,858
Okay, Harvey, I'll make you a deal.

115
00:10:34,281 --> 00:10:36,487
If I throw some facts together
about this Bombshell...

116
00:10:36,575 --> 00:10:37,195
- Bullet.
- Bullet...

117
00:10:37,195 --> 00:10:41,995
- ... and we chop down his apple tree...
- You get the assistant editor's desk.

118
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:50,100
Okay, chief.

119
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:54,827
You get Mack's story,
and I'll get you your Bullet.

120
00:11:00,432 --> 00:11:03,766
"The lone moment of glory
came in the 4th quarter,"

121
00:11:03,852 --> 00:11:07,019
"when Jimmy 'Dodge' Connelly
lateraled to Bakes Davis,"

122
00:11:07,106 --> 00:11:09,941
"who ran through
a trio of open-field tackles"

123
00:11:10,025 --> 00:11:12,306
"and into the Duluth end zone."

124
00:11:12,695 --> 00:11:16,562
"And whereas the hotly disputed contest
will go down in the books"

125
00:11:16,657 --> 00:11:21,070
"as a Toledo victory,
the hearts and minds of all who witnessed"

126
00:11:21,161 --> 00:11:26,073
"the classic gridiron confrontation
were clearly won by the Duluth Bulldogs."

127
00:11:28,294 --> 00:11:31,211
- Awfully good, Suds.
- Sure is a great thing to read, Suds.

128
00:11:31,297 --> 00:11:33,618
When the muse strikes,
who am I to resist?

129
00:11:33,966 --> 00:11:35,709
It's almost like
you were playin' the game yourself.

130
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:40,083
What I try to achieve in my prose
is a... sense of flight.

131
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:42,209
Now, that's a crowd,
ain't it, Dodge?

132
00:11:43,017 --> 00:11:45,590
Sure is. We didn't have crowds
like that when I was in school.

133
00:11:45,686 --> 00:11:47,180
-You went to college?
- Colleges.

134
00:11:49,648 --> 00:11:52,815
Waterford! Waterford next!

135
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,321
Waterford next!

136
00:11:57,323 --> 00:11:58,651
Waterford!

137
00:12:12,505 --> 00:12:14,129
Is that Big Gus Schiller?

138
00:12:14,215 --> 00:12:15,923
- How you doin', boy?
- Hey, how you doing?

139
00:12:16,008 --> 00:12:17,798
Here, get in this car.

140
00:12:19,011 --> 00:12:23,091
Boys... I want you to be meetin'
our newest player.

141
00:12:23,182 --> 00:12:26,714
This is Big Gus Schiller
from Penrose High School.

142
00:12:29,856 --> 00:12:32,525
Hi. How you doin'?
How's it goin'?

143
00:12:40,783 --> 00:12:43,570
- So, you're in high school, are you?
- Yeah.

144
00:12:44,829 --> 00:12:46,545
Got held back, did you?

145
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,119
No.

146
00:13:24,702 --> 00:13:27,703
Hey, kid! What position did you play
in high school?

147
00:13:28,373 --> 00:13:29,489
Kicker.

148
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:32,696
- Kicker?
- What the hell?...

149
00:13:33,408 --> 00:13:35,163
Coach thought
it'd be the best position for me.

150
00:13:35,255 --> 00:13:38,088
- Who's your coach?
- Math teacher.

151
00:13:40,009 --> 00:13:40,962
Huddle up.

152
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:01,608
Hooked it.

153
00:14:08,371 --> 00:14:12,372
17... 32... 24... hike!

154
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:17,707
God! Right in the...

155
00:14:21,176 --> 00:14:25,999
Gus, look. You stand over here, next to him,
and you hit anybody that comes near 'im.

156
00:14:26,473 --> 00:14:28,130
Anybody that comes near 'im!

157
00:14:30,352 --> 00:14:31,129
41...

158
00:14:32,354 --> 00:14:35,359
33... 37... hike!

159
00:14:50,414 --> 00:14:51,730
Oh, I like him.

160
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,963
Dodge,
I need to have a speech with you.

161
00:15:10,392 --> 00:15:12,385
What do you mean folded?
Milwaukee can't fold.

162
00:15:12,561 --> 00:15:16,689
They're broke, is what.
Like Akron. No money, no team.

163
00:15:17,691 --> 00:15:19,051
We're broke, too.

164
00:15:19,651 --> 00:15:22,905
- We're broke now? Our season just started!
- Look, we're broke, I'm tellin' you.

165
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:25,907
If you got no money to pay salaries,
no money to buy train tickets,

166
00:15:25,991 --> 00:15:28,359
no money to rent a field,
then you're broke.

167
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:34,461
It's over... Dodge.
It's time to... pack it up and go home.

168
00:15:34,917 --> 00:15:38,612
Starch king is gonna sell us
51% o' the team as soon as he can.

169
00:15:45,261 --> 00:15:47,253
What's gonna happen to these guys?

170
00:15:47,972 --> 00:15:49,051
I don't know.

171
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:52,174
And I thought the Milwaukee game
would turn it around,

172
00:15:52,268 --> 00:15:54,841
what with Big Gus
comin' on board for us.

173
00:15:55,271 --> 00:15:58,223
Milwaukee got Joe Washburn
playing good, but...

174
00:15:59,525 --> 00:16:01,404
Now, there's no Milwaukee game.

175
00:16:02,319 --> 00:16:03,845
It's finished.

176
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:10,644
Half these guys will probably end up
back in the mines.

177
00:16:11,203 --> 00:16:14,620
This isn't exactly
the cream of America's work force.

178
00:16:15,124 --> 00:16:16,578
They don't have a lot of options.

179
00:16:20,379 --> 00:16:21,542
Shit!

180
00:16:21,797 --> 00:16:23,956
<i>I'll read you what he had to say.</i>

181
00:16:24,550 --> 00:16:27,551
<i>"I regret to inform you
that Perennial Starch"</i>

182
00:16:27,636 --> 00:16:31,800
<i>"is hereby terminating our sponsorship
of the Duluth Bulldogs."</i>

183
00:16:33,643 --> 00:16:35,635
<i>So that's it, fellas.</i>

184
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:37,887
<i>It's the end of the line for us.</i>

185
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:43,559
<i>This will be your last paycheck.
From here on out, you're on your own.</i>

186
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:48,655
<i>But I-I wanna say
what a privilege it's been to coach you boys.</i>

187
00:16:50,159 --> 00:16:52,567
<i>What you've done on the field
has been amazing.</i>

188
00:16:52,787 --> 00:16:56,915
<i>Big Gus, I want to say to you, son,
thank you for comin'.</i>

189
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:11,921
- Name?
- Connelly.

190
00:17:12,014 --> 00:17:13,343
Dodge Connelly.

191
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,304
- Age?
- 38.

192
00:17:17,854 --> 00:17:22,550
- 39?
- Ha! 45. Skill?

193
00:17:25,278 --> 00:17:26,722
How do you mean?

194
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:31,557
Are you a welder or a machinist
or a pipe fitter? You know... skills.

195
00:17:31,557 --> 00:17:33,029
Nah, I gotcha.

196
00:17:36,247 --> 00:17:37,789
Did you serve in the war?

197
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:42,322
- Yes.
- Well, you must have learned a trade there.

198
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,322
Not one you'd like.

199
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:50,143
Mr. Connelly,
if you have no trade skills,

200
00:17:50,143 --> 00:17:53,552
how have you made a living
in the last 20 years?

201
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:03,965
- Cup o' coffee. How much is coffee?
- 10 cents.

202
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:07,077
Here... 15. You keep it.

203
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,147
Now I can buy
that house I always wanted.

204
00:18:09,239 --> 00:18:11,278
<i>And while
only halfway through the Princeton season,</i>

205
00:18:11,366 --> 00:18:15,446
<i>Carter "The Bullet" Rutherford
has piled on a whopping 14 touchdowns</i>

206
00:18:15,537 --> 00:18:17,660
<i>and 720 yards.</i>

207
00:18:17,747 --> 00:18:19,740
<i>We spoke to the Medal of Honor winner
after the game.</i>

208
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,752
<i>- Carter, how you feelin'?
- Feel pretty good, Mac.</i>

209
00:18:22,836 --> 00:18:25,706
<i>Their defense just kept comin' atcha,
but I figured I might get around them</i>

210
00:18:25,797 --> 00:18:27,422
<i>if I just put my mind to it.</i>

211
00:18:27,507 --> 00:18:29,416
<i>Guess I've learned somethin'
from dodging those Jerries.</i>

212
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:33,423
<i>And that's the kind of
bravery on display every Saturday, folks.</i>

213
00:18:33,513 --> 00:18:36,929
<i>The kind of fearlessness
that brings in those fans by the thousands.</i>

214
00:18:37,017 --> 00:18:39,721
<i>Some 40,000 people on hand
just last Saturday.</i>

215
00:18:39,811 --> 00:18:41,970
<i>Now, here's a little ditty
I'm sure you'll all know.</i>

216
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,648
40,000 people?

217
00:19:54,094 --> 00:19:56,786
I'm trying to reach C.C. Frazier.
Do you know how...

218
00:19:58,682 --> 00:20:00,182
Well, why can't you tell me?

219
00:20:00,768 --> 00:20:03,471
Listen, my name's Connelly.
It's about football.

220
00:20:04,772 --> 00:20:06,651
I've... I've never heard of you,
either, Miss. I...

221
00:20:07,107 --> 00:20:10,322
No, what I... what I...
Hello?... Hel...

222
00:20:13,614 --> 00:20:14,942
Sheez!

223
00:20:45,646 --> 00:20:47,971
- Cause I said I liked your dress?
- Stop saying that!

224
00:20:48,065 --> 00:20:49,346
- It's true.
- It's boring.

225
00:20:49,442 --> 00:20:52,561
- It's all I wanted to say.
- I'm starting to think it's all you can say.

226
00:20:52,653 --> 00:20:54,029
- What's your name?
- Leonard.

227
00:20:54,113 --> 00:20:57,030
Leonard, you better run along
before my fiancé gets here.

228
00:20:57,116 --> 00:20:59,572
He's far less tolerant
of your existence than I am.

229
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,282
There's no reason to be angry.
I was simply paying you a compliment.

230
00:21:02,371 --> 00:21:06,288
Stop it. You're just acting like a big baby
cause you miss your mother's bosoms.

231
00:21:07,835 --> 00:21:09,792
- My mother's what?
- Her bosoms, you goof!

232
00:21:09,879 --> 00:21:11,955
You're substituting my bosoms
for your mother's.

233
00:21:12,048 --> 00:21:15,757
- What? No, I'm not.
- Why not? What's wrong with my bosoms?

234
00:21:21,182 --> 00:21:24,681
Honestly, Miss Littleton,
we're in public. The rules of etiquette apply.

235
00:21:24,769 --> 00:21:28,268
Oh, Leonard, it's 1925.
There are no rules.

236
00:21:28,356 --> 00:21:30,929
Except that boys like you
are tedious until they're 40,

237
00:21:31,025 --> 00:21:33,397
at which point
they become unbearably tedious.

238
00:21:33,486 --> 00:21:37,151
- I didn't come over here to be insulted.
- No? Where do you usually go?

239
00:21:42,787 --> 00:21:44,447
And don't think
just cause you haven't said anything

240
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:46,116
that I don't know
what you're up to.

241
00:21:46,207 --> 00:21:49,199
I'm talking to you,
behind the magazine...

242
00:21:49,544 --> 00:21:52,202
Don't you know I could have you arrested
for eavesdropping?

243
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,707
- Excuse me?
- Or are you really an avid reader

244
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,171
- of "Ladies' Home Journal"?
- I never miss an issue.

245
00:21:57,385 --> 00:21:58,548
I see.

246
00:22:00,471 --> 00:22:02,547
- Waiting for someone?
- I'm sorry, were you speaking to me?

247
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:05,677
No, just practising my American accent.
Course I was speaking to you.

248
00:22:05,768 --> 00:22:07,179
As a matter of fact,
I was waiting for someone.

249
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:08,502
- Who?
- A business associate.

250
00:22:08,502 --> 00:22:12,890
Oh, a business associate.
So cryptic. So manly.

251
00:22:12,984 --> 00:22:16,068
Clearly beyond the comprehension
of a feeble female.

252
00:22:16,362 --> 00:22:17,525
If you say so.

253
00:22:18,072 --> 00:22:20,564
What I wanna know is why you chose
to come in here from the lobby,

254
00:22:20,658 --> 00:22:21,987
where you obviously had business,

255
00:22:22,077 --> 00:22:24,662
to sit next to me
and listen to my conversation.

256
00:22:24,913 --> 00:22:28,028
Tell me. Or are you afraid to say?

257
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:30,192
I'm not afraid to say it.

258
00:22:31,419 --> 00:22:32,795
I'm in love with Leonard.

259
00:22:33,505 --> 00:22:34,536
Go ahead and laugh,
everyone does.

260
00:22:34,631 --> 00:22:37,003
We had something beautiful
until you came along.

261
00:22:37,092 --> 00:22:39,713
You think you can just toss 'im away
like a sack of flour?

262
00:22:39,803 --> 00:22:42,969
- That's funny.
- Hey, haven't you done enough?

263
00:22:43,056 --> 00:22:45,013
No, really, who are you?

264
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:46,760
- What's your name?
- I'm Dodge.

265
00:22:46,851 --> 00:22:50,635
- Dodge Connelly of Duluth, Minnesota.
- Lexie Littleton. Champaign, Illinois.

266
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:54,849
Hey... Lexie...
What are you doing for dinner?

267
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,270
You're a lot o' fun, Mr. Connelly,

268
00:22:57,362 --> 00:22:59,355
and I'm sorry
I'm not gonna get to know you better,

269
00:22:59,447 --> 00:23:03,741
but you should leave
before my fiancé gets here. He's kinda big.

270
00:23:05,036 --> 00:23:07,444
- I can handle myself.
- No, really, Mr. Connelly.

271
00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:10,659
Mr. Connelly is buried
next to my mother. I'm Dodge.

272
00:23:10,750 --> 00:23:13,954
- Dodge, it'd be better if you go.
- Better for whom?

273
00:23:15,881 --> 00:23:17,957
Don't get familiar, Mr. Connelly.

274
00:23:18,049 --> 00:23:20,993
Just because we had a laugh
doesn't mean you know me.

275
00:23:22,471 --> 00:23:25,766
- My apologies.
- Apology accepted.

276
00:23:27,392 --> 00:23:29,055
But I do know you.

277
00:23:29,811 --> 00:23:31,685
- You think so?
- Oh, yeah.

278
00:23:31,772 --> 00:23:32,851
- Really?
- Yeah.

279
00:23:32,939 --> 00:23:34,482
You're the kind of cocktail
that comes on like sugar,

280
00:23:34,566 --> 00:23:35,977
but gives you a kick in the head.

281
00:23:36,068 --> 00:23:37,977
The only thing you hate worse
than a guy making a play

282
00:23:38,070 --> 00:23:39,564
is when a guy doesn't make a play.

283
00:23:39,655 --> 00:23:41,564
Oh, you makin' a play?
I hadn't realized.

284
00:23:41,698 --> 00:23:43,905
It might work on my aunt Lurleen.
She's a little near-sighted.

285
00:23:43,992 --> 00:23:47,418
There's an article on peach-canning in here
that I'm dying to get back to.

286
00:23:50,332 --> 00:23:51,992
Well, I know you, too,
Dodge Connelly.

287
00:23:52,084 --> 00:23:55,001
You think you're the slickest operator
in Duluth, and maybe you are,

288
00:23:55,087 --> 00:23:58,670
but being the slickest operator in Duluth
is kinda like being the world's tallest midget,

289
00:23:58,757 --> 00:24:00,714
- if you ask me.
- It's too bad we know each other so well.

290
00:24:00,801 --> 00:24:02,176
- We might have gotten along.
- Well, I'll live.

291
00:24:02,261 --> 00:24:03,304
Alone.

292
00:24:03,595 --> 00:24:04,840
Lexie?

293
00:24:06,682 --> 00:24:08,873
Mr. Frazier, Lexie Littleton.

294
00:24:09,685 --> 00:24:11,512
I do apologize
for keeping you waiting.

295
00:24:11,770 --> 00:24:15,590
- So, where is this cute boyfriend of mine?
- Well, I thought he was behind me, but...

296
00:24:17,443 --> 00:24:19,005
There he is now.

297
00:24:20,654 --> 00:24:23,988
He finds it very difficult
moving around in public.

298
00:24:24,783 --> 00:24:26,100
Carter!

299
00:24:26,666 --> 00:24:27,809
Say, C.C.!

300
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:30,197
He loves his fans.

301
00:24:32,124 --> 00:24:35,873
Carter, this is Miss Littleton of "The Tribune".
She's doing a piece on you.

302
00:24:35,961 --> 00:24:37,586
Well... That'll be fine.

303
00:24:37,671 --> 00:24:40,043
- A pleasure, Mr. Rutherford.
- Carter, Miss Littleton.

304
00:24:40,132 --> 00:24:41,507
Lexie, Carter.

305
00:24:41,717 --> 00:24:43,840
- Say, C.C...
- Oh, there you are.

306
00:24:44,053 --> 00:24:45,962
Could you bring the car around?
We're ready to leave.

307
00:24:46,055 --> 00:24:48,462
- I don't think this gentleman works here.
- No?

308
00:24:48,557 --> 00:24:50,929
He certainly looks
like the retrieving type.

309
00:24:52,394 --> 00:24:56,855
- Do you work here, Dodge?
- No, C.C., I came to talk to you.

310
00:24:56,941 --> 00:25:01,680
Yes, well, I'm afraid we're going to dinner.
Come, let's find a real valet, shall we?

311
00:25:05,074 --> 00:25:08,276
I've 20,000 dollars
that says you might wanna talk.

312
00:25:10,538 --> 00:25:12,447
So, if I understand you correctly,
Mr. Connelly,

313
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:15,706
it's your intention
to legitimize professional football?

314
00:25:15,793 --> 00:25:17,702
- That's right.
- Well, let me say straight off,

315
00:25:17,795 --> 00:25:20,251
there's no such beast
as professional football.

316
00:25:20,423 --> 00:25:24,420
There's only miners and farmers and
shell-shocked veterans of the Great War,

317
00:25:24,510 --> 00:25:26,337
smashing each other's skulls together

318
00:25:26,429 --> 00:25:29,595
in a million turnip fields
from Duluth to East Jesus.

319
00:25:30,182 --> 00:25:33,294
Now I ask you,
how do you intend to legitimize that?

320
00:25:33,936 --> 00:25:36,344
By keepin' it alive,
by investing in a team.

321
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:39,797
Well, you see, there's the catch.
I'm not interested in investing.

322
00:25:40,067 --> 00:25:45,092
I'm more of a 20-percenter.
New talent, new ideas interest me.

323
00:25:45,531 --> 00:25:47,654
Professional football
does not attract new talent,

324
00:25:47,742 --> 00:25:51,241
and investing in
a professional football team is not a new idea.

325
00:25:52,955 --> 00:25:54,111
Dodge,

326
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,375
we had some laughs a few years ago.

327
00:25:57,460 --> 00:25:59,868
- You had some laughs.
- Yes.

328
00:26:00,797 --> 00:26:02,789
Yes, I guess I did.

329
00:26:04,467 --> 00:26:06,623
- So...
- Okay.

330
00:26:07,804 --> 00:26:09,630
How 'bout this for a new idea?

331
00:26:09,806 --> 00:26:12,641
Carter Rutherford leaves Princeton
to play for the Duluth Bulldogs.

332
00:26:12,725 --> 00:26:14,469
- What?
- Hear me out.

333
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,434
Carter, you're a pretty remarkable guy,
aren't you?

334
00:26:16,562 --> 00:26:18,602
- I just play football.
- You don't have to be modest with me.

335
00:26:18,690 --> 00:26:19,505
I know your story.

336
00:26:19,899 --> 00:26:23,066
How you put your education on hold
to serve your country, to fight in the war...

337
00:26:23,152 --> 00:26:24,481
I was just doing
what I thought was right.

338
00:26:24,571 --> 00:26:26,231
The President
gave you a medal for bravery.

339
00:26:26,322 --> 00:26:28,398
I was just in the right place
at the right time.

340
00:26:28,491 --> 00:26:31,777
That's not what the papers said.
They called you the... the hero of the Argonne.

341
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:34,870
And then, when you went back to school,
you turned out to be a football hero, too.

342
00:26:34,956 --> 00:26:36,921
- Mr. Connelly, I'm just a guy...
- Carter.

343
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,626
Do kids chase you
down the hallway at school?

344
00:26:40,086 --> 00:26:41,117
Sometimes.

345
00:26:41,212 --> 00:26:43,169
Follow you around?
Ask you for an autograph?

346
00:26:43,256 --> 00:26:46,008
It happens, yeah,
but you can't take that stuff too seriously.

347
00:26:46,092 --> 00:26:48,844
You feel like sometimes
everybody wants something from you?

348
00:26:49,429 --> 00:26:53,879
And how are you compensated for
living your life under that kinda public scrutiny?

349
00:26:54,218 --> 00:26:56,998
By paying tuition to Princeton.

350
00:27:05,362 --> 00:27:08,304
Let me ask you a question.
Do you like playing football?

351
00:27:08,865 --> 00:27:10,146
I love playing football.

352
00:27:10,241 --> 00:27:12,897
Good. You got one more year
and that's it. That's all she wrote.

353
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,040
What are you gonna do then?

354
00:27:15,455 --> 00:27:17,613
Actually, I've already been accepted
to Yale Law School.

355
00:27:17,707 --> 00:27:19,700
I have a position waiting for me
at Hager, Danes and Upton

356
00:27:19,793 --> 00:27:21,288
when I get my law degree.

357
00:27:21,503 --> 00:27:24,448
It turns out, I'm not too bad a student,
when I put my mind to it.

358
00:27:26,299 --> 00:27:29,700
You... That-that's good.
It's good.

359
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:33,207
And... all of that will be waiting for you,
no question about it.

360
00:27:33,473 --> 00:27:35,217
But the world's full of good lawyers.

361
00:27:35,308 --> 00:27:37,716
In football,
there's only one Carter Rutherford.

362
00:27:37,811 --> 00:27:40,878
You don't need any more teaching
to be what you are out on the field.

363
00:27:41,064 --> 00:27:44,799
You ought to be playing football, and
you ought to be rewarded for your talent.

364
00:27:48,405 --> 00:27:53,056
- Makes sense. Sort of.
- So did bloodletting at the time.

365
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:57,278
You're very passionate, Mr. Connelly.
What exactly do you have in mind?

366
00:27:59,082 --> 00:28:03,356
Carter Rutherford takes a temporary leave
from Princeton to play for Duluth...

367
00:28:04,254 --> 00:28:08,916
and in exchange
he is guaranteed... 5,000 dollars a game.

368
00:28:15,432 --> 00:28:17,010
Let's you and I have another drink,
Mr. Connelly.

369
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:18,297
You're the boss.

370
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:21,051
Why don't you two run along,
conduct your interview,

371
00:28:21,188 --> 00:28:24,570
whilst Mr. Connelly and I...
thrash out your future?

372
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:27,854
Come on, Carter.

373
00:28:35,452 --> 00:28:37,528
Carter Rutherford wouldn't
sit on a bench for that kind of money.

374
00:28:37,621 --> 00:28:39,032
Did I say 5? I meant 10.

375
00:28:39,289 --> 00:28:40,914
I assume you'll be paying this
out of gate receipts?

376
00:28:40,999 --> 00:28:42,791
- That's right.
- Of course, I'll want it in the form

377
00:28:42,876 --> 00:28:45,712
of a guarantee.
Plus, I get a percentage of the overages.

378
00:28:45,796 --> 00:28:47,954
Of course.
In the neighbourhood of 5%.

379
00:28:48,215 --> 00:28:50,042
I was thinking a little more uptown.

380
00:28:50,968 --> 00:28:53,293
- 10?
- 25.

381
00:28:56,348 --> 00:28:59,515
I'll understand if you decline.
Most teams would.

382
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:02,016
Most, but... not all.

383
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:13,900
Sudsy? Listen up.

384
00:29:13,991 --> 00:29:16,778
Carter Rutherford's gonna be playing
for the Duluth Bulldogs starting Sunday.

385
00:29:16,869 --> 00:29:20,320
We're... What? No, just listen.
We're taking a Pullman to Duluth tonight.

386
00:29:20,414 --> 00:29:22,870
We're gonna get there in the morning.
Round up everybody you can.

387
00:29:22,958 --> 00:29:26,149
Get the word around. I want
a nice welcoming committee when we pull in.

388
00:29:26,378 --> 00:29:30,239
What? Just trust me.
Thanks, pal.

389
00:29:30,508 --> 00:29:34,920
Harvey, change of plans. I'm taking a train
with these knuckleheads to Duluth.

390
00:29:35,012 --> 00:29:38,547
What? No, I haven't been drinking!
It's a long story.

391
00:29:38,641 --> 00:29:41,595
Just give me a few days.
Hey, how'd it go with Mack Steiner?

392
00:29:41,852 --> 00:29:43,679
So, don't use his name.

393
00:29:43,771 --> 00:29:47,211
Believe me, Harvey, by the end of the week,
this kid will cook his own goose.

394
00:29:47,525 --> 00:29:49,014
I gotta go.

395
00:30:02,206 --> 00:30:03,700
Hey, what are you doing?

396
00:30:04,208 --> 00:30:05,371
Sorry.

397
00:30:17,889 --> 00:30:21,078
You know, truth be told,
I was a better baseball player.

398
00:30:21,184 --> 00:30:23,496
But college baseball isn't too popular.

399
00:30:24,228 --> 00:30:27,894
What about the war?
Where'd all that courage come from?

400
00:30:28,232 --> 00:30:30,225
Oh, I don't know about courage.

401
00:30:30,485 --> 00:30:33,320
A platoon of German soldiers
surrendered to you.

402
00:30:33,571 --> 00:30:36,718
Quite a few have made a lot
out of much less.

403
00:30:37,116 --> 00:30:38,760
Let's talk about something else.

404
00:30:40,078 --> 00:30:42,403
Like, how did Miss Lexie Littleton
get so curious

405
00:30:42,497 --> 00:30:46,744
- she worked her way up a newspaper room?
- Not really the homemaker type.

406
00:30:47,418 --> 00:30:49,328
Depends on the home, I guess.

407
00:31:02,934 --> 00:31:04,415
This is me.

408
00:31:06,229 --> 00:31:09,064
- An eventful day, Mr. Bullet.
- Good night, Lexie.

409
00:31:09,858 --> 00:31:13,191
Bright and early, Bullet.
You got a big day ahead.

410
00:31:18,283 --> 00:31:19,726
Hey, Lexie...

411
00:31:20,952 --> 00:31:23,930
You think I did the right thing
about this Duluth deal?

412
00:31:24,706 --> 00:31:27,898
I think you did the right thing
about the Duluth deal.

413
00:31:30,045 --> 00:31:31,373
Well, I'm glad.

414
00:31:33,298 --> 00:31:35,219
I'm happy you're glad.

415
00:31:38,136 --> 00:31:39,465
Good night.

416
00:31:42,307 --> 00:31:43,872
I'm glad you're glad.

417
00:31:44,294 --> 00:31:47,134
Oh, you've got a lot of moxie!

418
00:31:47,229 --> 00:31:50,728
I didn't know it was your berth.
I would have armed myself.

419
00:31:50,982 --> 00:31:52,145
I'm calling the porter.

420
00:31:52,234 --> 00:31:54,689
- I'm not decent.
- Well, there's an understatement!

421
00:31:54,778 --> 00:31:55,857
Neither are you.

422
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:57,938
- You looked?
- I glanced.

423
00:31:58,490 --> 00:32:00,317
- Need help with that hook?
- No.

424
00:32:09,751 --> 00:32:12,159
- Good evening.
- Yes, it is.

425
00:32:12,254 --> 00:32:15,005
You know...
this may seem a little awkward

426
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:17,949
coming from the man
who only promotes the man of your dreams,

427
00:32:18,093 --> 00:32:19,753
but I've had a little thought.

428
00:32:20,012 --> 00:32:24,259
- Perhaps it can wait till tomorrow?
- Uh, yeah, probably, but that's not my style.

429
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:28,051
You see, Miss Littleton,
Carter is very important to me.

430
00:32:28,145 --> 00:32:30,303
I wanna make sure you treat him fairly
in your newspaper.

431
00:32:30,397 --> 00:32:32,667
- Oh, I resent the implication that I wouldn't.
- Lexie,

432
00:32:32,983 --> 00:32:36,150
Carter is good for the country.
He's a war hero.

433
00:32:36,278 --> 00:32:39,777
Good for "The Tribune", they sell newspapers.
Good for me.

434
00:32:39,865 --> 00:32:42,399
- Good for you.
- Lexie...

435
00:32:44,286 --> 00:32:47,382
I'm having a conversation
with a rather beautiful woman,

436
00:32:48,123 --> 00:32:51,290
and she and I were wondering
if you'd care to join us for a nightcap?

437
00:32:51,376 --> 00:32:53,939
- Good night, C.C.
- Good night, Lexie.

438
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:04,137
- What?
- I think I'll sleep up here tonight.

439
00:33:04,264 --> 00:33:06,553
Oh, you most certainly will not!

440
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:07,829
Really?

441
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:12,062
"Believe me, Harvey, by the end o' the week,
this kid will cook his own goose."

442
00:33:12,314 --> 00:33:15,232
- You were spying on me!
- I was observing.

443
00:33:15,317 --> 00:33:19,223
- So, you wanna play dirty?
- Maybe later. I'm a little tired right now.

444
00:33:22,658 --> 00:33:24,151
So here we are.

445
00:33:25,244 --> 00:33:28,180
- Not sure what the next move is.
- It happens.

446
00:33:29,665 --> 00:33:32,333
- It's the first time for me.
- They all say that.

447
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,092
- I'm sure you snore.
- Attagirl!

448
00:33:41,343 --> 00:33:44,470
Listen. I'm sorry
if what I said today upset you.

449
00:33:45,014 --> 00:33:46,342
Don't be.

450
00:33:48,184 --> 00:33:51,162
- Which part?
- The "kick in the head" part.

451
00:33:51,687 --> 00:33:53,184
It's forgotten.

452
00:33:54,523 --> 00:33:57,973
- Sorry if what I said today upset you.
- Don't be.

453
00:33:59,945 --> 00:34:03,192
- Which part?
- The "tallest midget" part.

454
00:34:03,532 --> 00:34:05,320
What about the "I know you" part?

455
00:34:06,202 --> 00:34:09,472
- I still mean that.
- Then I'm still upset.

456
00:35:03,092 --> 00:35:05,880
- You're the tops!
- Hey, Carter!

457
00:35:15,647 --> 00:35:16,892
Carter! Carter!

458
00:35:16,981 --> 00:35:20,267
It's a three-ring circus
with Carter as the dancing bear.

459
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,187
Yeah.
Wonder what that makes us.

460
00:35:22,278 --> 00:35:25,445
Dodge, look, look!
Welcome to show business!

461
00:35:25,782 --> 00:35:26,908
Hi!

462
00:35:31,871 --> 00:35:33,698
When's the last Princeton game,
Carter?

463
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,282
I guess I already played it.

464
00:35:35,542 --> 00:35:37,534
So, you going to shake up the team?
Anybody you want fired?

465
00:35:37,627 --> 00:35:41,580
No, no, no, of course not. I'm not the coach.
And, besides, they're a great bunch o' players.

466
00:35:49,597 --> 00:35:51,389
Hey! Where the hell is everybody?

467
00:35:51,474 --> 00:35:54,428
C.C. moved practice over to Ennis Field,
at the university.

468
00:35:54,769 --> 00:35:55,801
What?

469
00:35:56,730 --> 00:35:57,892
Why?

470
00:36:41,358 --> 00:36:42,686
Is it illustrated?

471
00:36:42,776 --> 00:36:44,151
- You're late.
- Says who?

472
00:36:44,236 --> 00:36:45,778
It's 8:30. You're late.

473
00:36:45,862 --> 00:36:48,353
- How's your story comin'?
- Swell, thanks.

474
00:36:48,448 --> 00:36:49,943
Cooked his goose yet?

475
00:36:50,492 --> 00:36:52,366
You get crowds like this
when you practised?

476
00:36:52,452 --> 00:36:54,778
- By the thousands.
- Yeah, I'll bet.

477
00:36:54,871 --> 00:36:55,951
Dodge!

478
00:36:56,456 --> 00:36:59,126
You saw the crowd?
For a practice!

479
00:36:59,334 --> 00:37:02,981
Oh, I tell you, our shit has really come in!
And look at this!

480
00:37:06,175 --> 00:37:09,045
- That must make you happy, huh?
- It must.

481
00:37:13,223 --> 00:37:16,427
- Hey, Dodge, you see the new uniforms?
- Can you believe it?

482
00:37:16,518 --> 00:37:17,453
Yeah.

483
00:37:17,644 --> 00:37:19,767
Hey, Dodgie, look at this thing!

484
00:37:19,855 --> 00:37:21,812
- Brand spankin' new!
- Nice.

485
00:37:21,899 --> 00:37:23,726
- Say, Dodge.
- Hey, Dodge.

486
00:37:24,026 --> 00:37:26,044
- Hey, fellas.
- Say, Dodge, you missed callisthenics.

487
00:37:26,044 --> 00:37:28,803
- Thank God!
- Couple o'f plays we ran at Princeton.

488
00:37:29,156 --> 00:37:30,947
- A couple?
- Now, I was thinking,

489
00:37:31,033 --> 00:37:32,527
we should switch
to the single back formation

490
00:37:32,618 --> 00:37:34,657
rather than sticking with the wing.
What do you think?

491
00:37:34,745 --> 00:37:36,987
Well, the single back's good,
but, see, the way we ran the team...

492
00:37:37,081 --> 00:37:40,577
- Which one is me?
- That's you, right there, behind the guard.

493
00:37:40,793 --> 00:37:43,165
I guess I should get a couple o' diagrams
of the plays we run.

494
00:37:43,254 --> 00:37:46,917
Sure. Yeah. These are a lot like your plays,
only a little more... effective.

495
00:37:47,591 --> 00:37:51,177
- Well, a lot of our plays are pretty strong.
- Some yes, some no.

496
00:37:51,177 --> 00:37:54,181
But... all that matters is that we win.
We want to win, don't we, boys?

497
00:37:54,265 --> 00:37:56,141
- Yeah!
- You said it, Carter!

498
00:37:57,101 --> 00:37:59,870
Hey! They're here! Come on, fellas!

499
00:38:17,121 --> 00:38:20,107
- You're a 10.5, right, Dodge?
- 11.

500
00:38:31,302 --> 00:38:32,844
<i>Well, today's the big day, folks.</i>

501
00:38:32,929 --> 00:38:35,764
<i>Princeton's Carter Rutherford is playing
his first professional game,</i>

502
00:38:35,848 --> 00:38:38,932
<i>and it's right here at Ennis Field
with Duluth's own Bulldogs.</i>

503
00:38:39,018 --> 00:38:40,596
<i>People have been coming in
to town all week</i>

504
00:38:40,686 --> 00:38:43,723
<i>from locations as far as Akron, Ohio
and Lexington, Kentucky</i>

505
00:38:43,814 --> 00:38:46,484
<i>just to get a glimpse
of the 6'3" phenom.</i>

506
00:38:46,901 --> 00:38:50,400
<i>Tickets are 75 cents adults
and 25 cents for the rascals under 12.</i>

507
00:38:50,488 --> 00:38:52,564
<i>And if you're a Huskers fan,
it's 10 dollars.</i>

508
00:38:52,657 --> 00:38:54,733
<i>Just kidding, gang.
We love those Cleveland fans.</i>

509
00:38:55,118 --> 00:38:56,550
<i>See you at the game.</i>

510
00:39:10,007 --> 00:39:14,258
Come on, folks! Root for Carter!
Go, Bulldogs!

511
00:39:25,690 --> 00:39:27,837
They're calling for rain today, boys.

512
00:39:28,484 --> 00:39:32,814
- Hey! What's a girl doin' in the press box?
- Rutherford says she knows her stuff.

513
00:39:32,906 --> 00:39:35,524
Yeah? I'm thinkin'
maybe he knows her stuff.

514
00:39:38,203 --> 00:39:41,038
- Who you write for, honey?
- "Tribune", fatso.

515
00:39:41,289 --> 00:39:45,073
- Since when do they cover pro football?
- Since I decided to write about it.

516
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:53,046
- You planning on taking notes?
- Nah. Got a mind like an elephant.

517
00:39:53,134 --> 00:39:56,966
It's like the Library of Congress up there.
Nothing gets lost. Nothing gets stolen.

518
00:39:57,055 --> 00:39:58,597
- Ain't that right, Bob?
- Bill!

519
00:39:58,681 --> 00:39:59,841
Here we go.

520
00:40:32,382 --> 00:40:34,375
2... 34... hike!

521
00:40:47,355 --> 00:40:49,415
That Carter is really somethin', huh?

522
00:40:50,275 --> 00:40:52,268
- Great catch, Dodge.
- Nice, Dodge.

523
00:40:53,862 --> 00:40:55,487
23... hike!

524
00:41:20,639 --> 00:41:27,851
13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5,

525
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:32,357
4, 3, 2, 1!

526
00:41:32,568 --> 00:41:33,599
Bulldogs!

527
00:41:44,496 --> 00:41:46,033
See you, boys.

528
00:41:51,503 --> 00:41:55,003
"In his eagerly awaited debut
as a professional football player,"

529
00:41:55,090 --> 00:41:59,005
"Carter 'the Bullet' Rutherford
ran for an astonishing 162 yards."

530
00:41:59,511 --> 00:42:02,596
"Given his reported salary,
that's nearly 100 dollars a yard."

531
00:42:02,681 --> 00:42:05,504
"But the fleet-footed newcomer
earned every penny."

532
00:42:05,684 --> 00:42:08,579
"Unstoppable, unbeatable
and uncatchable,"

533
00:42:09,104 --> 00:42:12,299
"'the Bullet' has arrived,
and pro football..."

534
00:42:13,192 --> 00:42:14,911
"will never be the same."

535
00:42:14,944 --> 00:42:18,988
Well, he had a little help out there, Dodge.
You sure you want me to write it like that?

536
00:42:19,073 --> 00:42:21,824
- We didn't fold, did we?
- No, we didn't fold, Dodge.

537
00:42:26,038 --> 00:42:28,707
- He's a hell of a player.
- Yeah.

538
00:42:36,257 --> 00:42:39,008
- And what do you get out of all this?
- 10% of your gross income.

539
00:42:39,552 --> 00:42:40,714
10% of our...

540
00:42:40,803 --> 00:42:44,883
It's very little, when you consider
how much I can increase your salary.

541
00:42:45,016 --> 00:42:49,808
Well, just ask Carter.
MGM wants to sign him to a contract.

542
00:42:49,895 --> 00:42:51,223
Hey, you think that
I could be in the movies?

543
00:42:51,223 --> 00:42:53,705
Sure, Zoom. Just buy a ticket.

544
00:42:54,150 --> 00:42:57,815
Now, I want you to peruse
this diet and exercise plan,

545
00:42:57,903 --> 00:43:00,573
which Carter has evolved
for aspiring athletes.

546
00:43:01,073 --> 00:43:06,301
The, uh, Rutherford Diet, patent pending,
is based on scientific research.

547
00:43:22,887 --> 00:43:28,012
So, tell me,
where could I find a Lexie Littleton?

548
00:43:29,268 --> 00:43:33,240
- Chicago, I guess. There are a lot of us.
- Well, then I'm going to Chicago.

549
00:43:35,858 --> 00:43:37,187
How old are you?

550
00:43:37,276 --> 00:43:39,234
- A gentleman doesn't ask...
- I'm not a gentleman.

551
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:42,155
I'm a football player.
Are you 30?

552
00:43:43,366 --> 00:43:48,242
I'm just shy of that mark, thank you.
How old are you? 24?

553
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:51,330
Just past that mark, thank you.

554
00:43:54,294 --> 00:43:56,225
- That's a lie.
- Yes, it is.

555
00:44:03,303 --> 00:44:05,461
- I'm 31.
- Yep.

556
00:45:10,036 --> 00:45:11,365
<i>Do you have a question?</i>

557
00:45:11,455 --> 00:45:13,246
<i>Pro football's got
a completely different style, Carter.</i>

558
00:45:13,331 --> 00:45:15,869
<i>They play two, three games a week.
How do you plan on adjusting to that?</i>

559
00:45:15,959 --> 00:45:18,794
<i>Well,
maybe they'll kind of adjust to me.</i>

560
00:45:23,550 --> 00:45:25,459
<i>There goes the gun.
Is it possible, folks?</i>

561
00:45:25,552 --> 00:45:28,470
<i>With this young man, well,
yes, it is! Touchdown!</i>

562
00:45:28,722 --> 00:45:31,295
<i>You ready, Mickey? Okay, flash.</i>

563
00:45:31,391 --> 00:45:33,882
"With another eye-opening display
of canny passing"

564
00:45:33,977 --> 00:45:37,097
"and superb broken-field running,
Carter 'the Bullet' Rutherford"

565
00:45:37,189 --> 00:45:38,648
"led the Bulldogs to victory"

566
00:45:38,732 --> 00:45:41,223
"over an increasingly forlorn
Pottsville team."

567
00:45:41,652 --> 00:45:44,653
"The choice that awaits these teams is
to imitate the college techniques"

568
00:45:44,738 --> 00:45:46,814
"that Rutherford has transplanted
to the pro game"

569
00:45:46,907 --> 00:45:49,908
"or to fall hopelessly behind
in the standings."

570
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,031
"What is certain are the crowds
that this Duluth team is attracting."

571
00:45:53,121 --> 00:45:56,455
"And the gate receipts that are rolling in
should open every team's eyes"

572
00:45:56,542 --> 00:45:58,333
"to the fact that Rutherford's Bulldogs"

573
00:45:58,418 --> 00:46:01,455
"have launched a new era
in professional football."

574
00:46:02,423 --> 00:46:03,502
That ought to hold them.

575
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:05,583
I'll get back to you tomorrow
after the Panther game.

576
00:46:05,843 --> 00:46:07,624
- Okay, Lexie.
- Gimme that.

577
00:46:09,096 --> 00:46:10,027
Lexie.

578
00:46:10,681 --> 00:46:14,465
- I know, Harvey.
- It's been four weeks. Where's my war hero?

579
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:17,596
Everyone's a little coy.
This story will loosen 'em up.

580
00:46:17,688 --> 00:46:19,063
Just gimme a little more time.

581
00:46:19,148 --> 00:46:22,351
I just don't want another sports fan
writin' a love letter.

582
00:46:22,443 --> 00:46:24,519
Dust off that editor's desk, Harvey.

583
00:46:24,612 --> 00:46:26,272
Assistant editor.

584
00:46:37,041 --> 00:46:40,042
Hey, Stump,
feel like crashing a gin mill or two?

585
00:46:40,127 --> 00:46:42,796
No, thanks, Dodge.
Some other time, maybe.

586
00:46:44,035 --> 00:46:44,896
No?

587
00:46:46,133 --> 00:46:49,051
Hey, what do you say, Curly?
Feel like hittin' the town?

588
00:46:49,136 --> 00:46:51,295
No, I'm hittin' the hay instead, Dodge.
Sorry.

589
00:46:52,223 --> 00:46:55,556
Zoom, you old lounge lizard...
What do you say?

590
00:46:55,643 --> 00:46:57,970
Gee, Dodge, I can't.
There's a curfew.

591
00:46:58,354 --> 00:47:00,643
Curfew? Since when?

592
00:47:00,731 --> 00:47:02,045
We voted on the train.

593
00:47:02,650 --> 00:47:03,978
Where was I?

594
00:47:04,485 --> 00:47:05,808
Asleep.

595
00:47:35,016 --> 00:47:38,848
- I would have left you, too.
- Was that a bad move? Hey, I sent her flowers.

596
00:47:38,936 --> 00:47:41,606
Well, then all is forgiven.

597
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:44,252
Yes, it is.

598
00:47:51,365 --> 00:47:53,691
Why don't you like to talk
about the Argonne?

599
00:47:55,370 --> 00:47:57,528
- Who's asking?
- Just me.

600
00:47:59,540 --> 00:48:01,722
Stories get bigger over time.

601
00:48:02,210 --> 00:48:05,349
- You never went to France.
- No, not that big.

602
00:48:05,713 --> 00:48:08,548
Everything they say happened...
happened.

603
00:48:08,883 --> 00:48:11,683
It's just that the telling of it gets
a little... better.

604
00:48:12,887 --> 00:48:14,381
How much better?

605
00:48:18,393 --> 00:48:20,180
We were pinned down in a gully.

606
00:48:21,729 --> 00:48:24,379
We were there
about three days, I guess.

607
00:48:24,899 --> 00:48:27,037
It had been raining for about a week.

608
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:29,499
So, some of the fellas and I,

609
00:48:29,499 --> 00:48:33,726
we... hunkered down in a foxhole,
and we just waited for the weather to break.

610
00:48:34,409 --> 00:48:37,006
A writer from "The Times" was with us.

611
00:48:37,704 --> 00:48:41,842
Now, you know I never drink,
but it was so cold and so wet...

612
00:48:43,001 --> 00:48:44,993
I started to
take a few slugs off a flask.

613
00:48:45,086 --> 00:48:47,197
Easy there, Carter.
That stuff will melt your teeth.

614
00:48:47,197 --> 00:48:48,787
Ja! Sehr gut.

615
00:48:48,882 --> 00:48:52,500
- Tell me again. Ich gebe surrender?
- Auf.

616
00:48:52,594 --> 00:48:56,888
Ich gebe auf. If you've no way out,
you lay down your rifle

617
00:48:56,973 --> 00:49:00,058
and yell, "Ich gebe auf",
otherwise they'll shoot you.

618
00:49:00,685 --> 00:49:02,310
Ich gebe auf!

619
00:49:03,021 --> 00:49:05,909
We were nearly out of ammo,
we were down to about nine fellas,

620
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:08,764
and we had this plan
that we were gonna speak enough German

621
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:12,558
to get us outta there.
Take our chances in a... war camp.

622
00:49:12,864 --> 00:49:16,647
All through the night, the fighting continued,
until we were all out of ammo.

623
00:49:17,285 --> 00:49:21,467
Sitting ducks.
And we had been up for 36 hours.

624
00:49:22,624 --> 00:49:24,066
That, and the drinking...

625
00:49:24,376 --> 00:49:27,045
Okay, fellas,
we ain't taking this spot any time soon.

626
00:49:27,129 --> 00:49:29,121
So, let's call it a night
and try again.

627
00:49:43,562 --> 00:49:45,868
I don't know
how long I was there.

628
00:49:46,314 --> 00:49:47,690
But it had to have been a few hours,

629
00:49:47,774 --> 00:49:50,396
because by that time,
the Jerries had taken the foxhole.

630
00:49:50,652 --> 00:49:53,342
But I was so covered up,
they never saw me.

631
00:49:53,572 --> 00:49:55,149
And I never saw them.

632
00:50:07,502 --> 00:50:11,955
I knew we were goners. So, I jumped up,
and I yelled "Ich gebe auf!"

633
00:50:15,803 --> 00:50:17,961
- Ich gebe auf!
- Ich gebe auf!

634
00:50:18,514 --> 00:50:21,668
They thought I was one of them,
so they just dropped their weapons.

635
00:50:22,518 --> 00:50:24,961
They just... gave up.

636
00:50:29,858 --> 00:50:32,693
Ich gebe auf! I'm unarmed!

637
00:50:32,778 --> 00:50:36,610
And it was right about then
that I started to have a really bad feeling.

638
00:50:37,157 --> 00:50:38,272
Carter?

639
00:50:38,367 --> 00:50:39,742
When it was all sorted out,

640
00:50:39,827 --> 00:50:42,697
the lieutenant thought it was best
if we all just kept our mouths shut.

641
00:50:42,871 --> 00:50:44,282
<i>One for "The Times", private.</i>

642
00:50:44,373 --> 00:50:46,521
Let the chips fall where they may.

643
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:50,369
And then... the story got bigger.

644
00:50:50,713 --> 00:50:52,373
The President gave you a medal.

645
00:50:52,715 --> 00:50:54,999
I would have made liars
out of all the fellas.

646
00:50:55,509 --> 00:50:56,707
We were stuck.

647
00:50:57,052 --> 00:50:59,543
That's a lot of responsibility
for a young man.

648
00:51:00,556 --> 00:51:02,159
I grew up pretty fast.

649
00:51:05,978 --> 00:51:07,799
It's quite a story.

650
00:51:08,314 --> 00:51:09,808
And now you know.

651
00:51:12,902 --> 00:51:14,479
Are we still friends?

652
00:51:25,748 --> 00:51:29,164
There's this one joint off of Halstead
that's at the bottom of a meat locker.

653
00:51:29,251 --> 00:51:32,599
Hey, Mikey. And you have to walk
through all this meat, like...

654
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:36,505
hanging... beef,
like beef, like bacon beef.

655
00:51:36,592 --> 00:51:39,261
And-and by the time you get in there,
you smell like a brewery.

656
00:51:39,345 --> 00:51:41,338
- Butcher shop.
- Butcher shop.

657
00:51:41,597 --> 00:51:44,515
Mr. Ziegfeld says that I'm the best dancer
in the line-up.

658
00:51:44,600 --> 00:51:45,881
- You don't say.
- Yeah.

659
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:48,515
My kicks are so high
that I almost knock myself out.

660
00:51:48,604 --> 00:51:50,513
- That's dangerous.
- Yeah, well...

661
00:51:50,606 --> 00:51:52,184
And I'm super flexible, too.

662
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:54,848
I can arch my back
so that my head hits my heels.

663
00:51:54,944 --> 00:51:56,652
Watch yourself there.

664
00:51:57,085 --> 00:52:00,575
Well, is... is Carter Rutherford very tall?
Because he looks really tall.

665
00:52:00,658 --> 00:52:02,283
But maybe that's just because
you're kinda short.

666
00:52:02,368 --> 00:52:03,349
Hey.

667
00:52:06,372 --> 00:52:08,263
- Hiya, Dodge. Come on in.
- Hey, Sully.

668
00:52:29,979 --> 00:52:32,449
- Evening, Dodge.
- Mr. Mayor.

669
00:52:32,964 --> 00:52:34,978
You... you know the Mayor?

670
00:52:35,109 --> 00:52:37,683
I ought to. I voted for him five times
in the last election.

671
00:52:39,447 --> 00:52:43,298
Well, if it isn't Dodge Connelly,
middle-aged boy wonder.

672
00:52:43,868 --> 00:52:46,703
Why, Lexie Littleton, breaking curfew.

673
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:48,865
I won't tell if you don't.

674
00:52:50,583 --> 00:52:53,584
Let me introduce you
to Miss, uh, Belinda Whippleworth.

675
00:52:53,795 --> 00:52:55,289
- Pleasure.
- Charmed.

676
00:52:55,547 --> 00:52:57,237
I have to pee.

677
00:52:59,592 --> 00:53:03,922
Enchanting girl. I thought you had to be 21
to get into a place like this.

678
00:53:04,097 --> 00:53:06,828
- She is 21.
- I meant her IQ.

679
00:53:06,863 --> 00:53:08,635
I wasn't plannin'
on runnin' her for Congress.

680
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:11,489
No? What were you planning
on doing with her?

681
00:53:11,604 --> 00:53:13,147
You know, the usual.

682
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:16,233
Put her in shoulder pads and a helmet,
and knock her brains out?

683
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:17,937
I think somebody beat me to it.

684
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:19,226
She'll do well in Congress.

685
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,497
Well, you're only as young
as the women you feel.

686
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:26,188
How quiet it must be at the Algonquin
with you here in Duluth...

687
00:53:28,330 --> 00:53:32,028
So, you flyin' solo,
or is the Bullet castin' about?

688
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:36,722
What do you care?
You're here to entertain Miss Nipplewidth.

689
00:53:36,722 --> 00:53:39,558
Wouldn't look good for you
to get caught in a place like this.

690
00:53:39,558 --> 00:53:43,797
I'd dare say it wouldn't look good
for anyone to be caught in a place like this.

691
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:02,481
Come on, let's dance.

692
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:06,982
Hey.

693
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:11,100
C'mon.

694
00:54:54,583 --> 00:54:56,410
What happened tonight?

695
00:54:59,630 --> 00:55:04,347
- Our boy's taken a liking to yours truly.
- Seems mutual, if you ask me.

696
00:55:04,718 --> 00:55:06,199
So much so...

697
00:55:06,595 --> 00:55:11,273
that he felt compelled to clear his conscience
on his sergeant York routine.

698
00:55:12,685 --> 00:55:16,488
You mean he didn't take out a whole platoon
with a bow and arrow?

699
00:55:55,686 --> 00:55:57,198
It's a raid! Let's go! Move it!

700
00:55:57,198 --> 00:55:59,423
Everybody beat it!
Get out of here!

701
00:56:17,625 --> 00:56:18,693
Wait, wait, wait!

702
00:56:28,636 --> 00:56:29,726
Go, go!

703
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:56,908
Would you have someone bring
a bottle of whiskey and some ice to room 404?

704
00:56:56,998 --> 00:56:58,576
I'm sorry, sir, we don't...

705
00:56:58,666 --> 00:57:01,197
Of course, sir.
Excuse me for one minute.

706
00:57:03,171 --> 00:57:05,937
Ambassador Hotel.
Excuse me?

707
00:57:06,925 --> 00:57:08,917
I'm sorry,
Miss Littleton is out for the evening.

708
00:57:09,010 --> 00:57:09,731
May I take a message?

709
00:57:10,595 --> 00:57:12,856
And who shall I say is calling?

710
00:57:13,431 --> 00:57:14,821
Harvey?

711
00:57:14,933 --> 00:57:17,410
Yes. From "The Tribune", hm...

712
00:57:17,941 --> 00:57:22,602
Mm-hm. Yes. "Boy Wonder". Right.

713
00:57:23,066 --> 00:57:25,391
Yes. "Cook his..."

714
00:57:27,278 --> 00:57:29,070
I'm sorry, how do you spell that?
Oh, "goose".

715
00:57:29,155 --> 00:57:31,029
Yes. Good. All right.

716
00:57:31,116 --> 00:57:33,192
Thank you... Thank you, Harvey.

717
00:57:35,078 --> 00:57:37,589
Stop, you two! Stop or I shoot!

718
00:57:38,123 --> 00:57:40,080
- He says he'll shoot!
- He always says that.

719
00:57:42,544 --> 00:57:43,559
I thought
you said he always says that!

720
00:57:43,559 --> 00:57:45,784
He does, just before he shoots.

721
00:57:56,433 --> 00:57:57,536
Gimme that.

722
00:58:10,071 --> 00:58:11,787
Don't do it!

723
00:58:13,617 --> 00:58:17,058
We got your mother here.
She wants to talk to you!

724
00:58:18,205 --> 00:58:20,696
Johnny, come on down, son!

725
00:58:21,291 --> 00:58:25,216
- Let's talk about this!
- I don't wanna live any more!

726
00:58:32,844 --> 00:58:36,065
- Johnny, please come down!
- No!

727
00:58:37,128 --> 00:58:38,986
All right. Follow my lead.

728
00:58:40,227 --> 00:58:41,906
We don't wanna
live any more, either!

729
00:58:45,107 --> 00:58:46,615
Who are you?

730
00:58:47,526 --> 00:58:50,625
What difference does it make?
We're-a kill ourselves!

731
00:58:51,697 --> 00:58:55,362
Wait a minute! Wait a minute!
Don't do anything drastic!

732
00:58:55,701 --> 00:58:57,173
It's too late!

733
00:58:57,208 --> 00:58:58,309
Come on.

734
00:58:59,538 --> 00:59:01,281
Goodbye, cruel world!

735
00:59:02,499 --> 00:59:04,243
Here they come!

736
00:59:06,044 --> 00:59:07,510
Thanks, fellas!

737
00:59:10,382 --> 00:59:12,308
Hey, look! There's two more!

738
00:59:19,099 --> 00:59:20,402
Mom?

739
00:59:25,731 --> 00:59:26,919
Say, C.C.

740
00:59:26,919 --> 00:59:28,815
Did you say anything
to Miss Littleton tonight

741
00:59:28,901 --> 00:59:31,356
that might compromise
your service record?

742
00:59:31,445 --> 00:59:33,568
- No.
- She's a reporter, Carter.

743
00:59:33,656 --> 00:59:35,580
No, nothing she'd repeat.

744
00:59:36,575 --> 00:59:38,698
- Let me buy you a drink.
- I don't drink.

745
00:59:38,786 --> 00:59:39,948
You will.

746
00:59:52,341 --> 00:59:56,042
So, then he jumps up
and-and he yells "I give up!" in German,

747
00:59:56,137 --> 00:59:58,628
and the Jerries think he's one of them,
because of the rain and the mud.

748
00:59:58,722 --> 01:00:00,181
You got a little soot in your eye.

749
01:00:00,266 --> 01:00:03,765
So, you see,
he's not this big war hero, but...

750
01:00:04,478 --> 01:00:05,641
Oh, I don't know.

751
01:00:05,730 --> 01:00:08,600
Ich gebe auf. Do you know
what that means? Ich gebe auf?

752
01:00:08,691 --> 01:00:11,298
"I give up" or somethin'.
Here, close your eye.

753
01:00:11,861 --> 01:00:12,892
Let me see.

754
01:00:15,448 --> 01:00:16,963
Now let me see.

755
01:00:23,122 --> 01:00:24,450
That's got it.

756
01:00:33,174 --> 01:00:36,543
You know that, uh,
sad Sunday night feeling you'd get

757
01:00:36,636 --> 01:00:39,471
when you knew the next day
you'd be back in school?

758
01:00:41,265 --> 01:00:43,935
I've got that feeling right now.

759
01:00:47,063 --> 01:00:48,225
Listen.

760
01:00:50,233 --> 01:00:53,452
You wouldn't be surprised to hear
that I'm nuts about you.

761
01:00:54,487 --> 01:00:56,493
You got guys tellin' you...

762
01:01:13,965 --> 01:01:17,739
- I've got some decisions to make.
- In a minute.

763
01:01:30,773 --> 01:01:31,951
Come on, I'll walk ya.

764
01:01:56,132 --> 01:01:58,151
C.C. tells
me you're printing that story.

765
01:01:59,469 --> 01:02:00,632
I haven't decided.

766
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:04,268
- You're not a reporter. You're a liar.
- Slow down there, Kaiser.

767
01:02:04,268 --> 01:02:07,428
If you just wanted a story, then why
didn't The Trib send one of their hacks

768
01:02:07,519 --> 01:02:09,227
with a cigar stuffed in their snout?

769
01:02:09,312 --> 01:02:12,147
But, no, they sent you
to snuggle up and play nice.

770
01:02:12,232 --> 01:02:15,067
I never was much for cigars,
but if it'd make you feel better...

771
01:02:15,151 --> 01:02:18,040
Maybe I should just leave 20 bucks
on the bed stand.

772
01:02:20,323 --> 01:02:23,352
- Take it easy, Carter.
- I thought you liked me.

773
01:02:23,618 --> 01:02:27,772
- Look... She's too old for you.
- What?! Well, you're too old for me!

774
01:02:27,772 --> 01:02:29,649
C'mon, you got me on that one.

775
01:02:30,125 --> 01:02:30,800
Why I ever let you...

776
01:02:32,419 --> 01:02:34,818
Wait... Where were you two?

777
01:02:35,922 --> 01:02:37,582
- Out.
- Nowhere.

778
01:02:37,674 --> 01:02:38,919
Did you kiss her?

779
01:02:39,009 --> 01:02:41,132
- Now, wait a minute!
- I want answers!

780
01:02:41,219 --> 01:02:45,134
Yeah, I kissed 'er! On the mouth, twice!
And I liked it. A lot.

781
01:02:45,223 --> 01:02:46,883
- Oh, you did, did you?
- Yeah.

782
01:02:46,975 --> 01:02:47,735
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

783
01:02:47,735 --> 01:02:51,008
Okay, we can do this right here,
or we can go outside.

784
01:02:51,104 --> 01:02:51,655
Get 'im, Dodge.

785
01:02:51,655 --> 01:02:53,310
- We got a game in five days.
- What?

786
01:02:53,398 --> 01:02:55,058
- What, you think you're gonna hurt me?
- I might.

787
01:02:55,150 --> 01:02:57,107
- Did you hear what he just called me?
- He's a little drunk.

788
01:02:57,194 --> 01:02:59,519
I am not drunk... you coward!

789
01:02:59,613 --> 01:03:01,024
Really?
Cause your sleeve's on fire.

790
01:03:01,114 --> 01:03:02,181
Really?

791
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,434
You two are a pair.

792
01:03:20,509 --> 01:03:22,931
You've created quite a stir, Lexie.

793
01:03:24,388 --> 01:03:26,215
I'm just getting started.

794
01:03:27,057 --> 01:03:31,291
You know, you have many qualities
that I like, not the least of which is intelligence.

795
01:03:31,895 --> 01:03:34,813
If you write that story,
I'll have your job.

796
01:03:35,149 --> 01:03:36,524
You wouldn't be very good at it.

797
01:03:36,608 --> 01:03:39,396
- You're quick, too.
- And I got great legs.

798
01:03:39,486 --> 01:03:41,049
First thing I noticed.

799
01:03:44,950 --> 01:03:46,665
The story runs tomorrow.

800
01:03:51,999 --> 01:03:53,659
See you tomorrow, Lexie.

801
01:04:04,803 --> 01:04:07,623
- Let's get this over with.
- Yeah.

802
01:04:11,352 --> 01:04:12,680
Outside.

803
01:04:31,122 --> 01:04:33,114
Go ahead. Throw one.

804
01:04:33,207 --> 01:04:35,532
No, you're the injured party.
You get the first punch.

805
01:04:39,380 --> 01:04:40,660
Not bad.

806
01:04:42,174 --> 01:04:44,228
Now when I get up,
I'm-a punch you back.

807
01:04:44,802 --> 01:04:46,239
I just wanna say...

808
01:04:46,971 --> 01:04:48,599
stay away from my right knee.

809
01:04:49,974 --> 01:04:51,302
Watch my left shoulder.

810
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:53,563
I will.

811
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:57,095
Also my right hindquarter.

812
01:04:57,189 --> 01:05:00,309
Behind my right thigh, but really,
the whole hindquarter.

813
01:05:03,654 --> 01:05:06,691
Well, you wouldn't punch me in the back,
would you? Because I got a bad back.

814
01:05:06,782 --> 01:05:07,945
No, never.

815
01:05:11,746 --> 01:05:13,920
- Let's just go for the face.
- Me too, just hit me in the face.

816
01:05:26,761 --> 01:05:28,588
Say, Harvey, I'm comin' home.

817
01:05:28,680 --> 01:05:29,482
<i>Did you get 'im?</i>

818
01:05:29,482 --> 01:05:32,261
Oh, I got 'im,
but you're not gonna like it.

819
01:05:32,767 --> 01:05:36,443
It's gonna read "We wanted a war hero
so badly that we went out and got one."

820
01:05:36,938 --> 01:05:39,818
<i>You did your job.
Now, come on home and write it.</i>

821
01:05:40,275 --> 01:05:44,473
You know something, Harvey?
Sometimes this job stinks.

822
01:05:45,530 --> 01:05:48,697
<i>A lot o' times, kid.
See you tomorrow.</i>

823
01:05:49,033 --> 01:05:51,192
Yeah, I'll see you tomorrow.

824
01:06:10,805 --> 01:06:11,489
That ought to hold you.

825
01:06:15,518 --> 01:06:16,940
How's your hand?

826
01:06:17,979 --> 01:06:19,817
I didn't mean to hurt it
with my face.

827
01:06:36,831 --> 01:06:38,961
I think I'll play for Chicago.

828
01:06:43,547 --> 01:06:45,159
I thought you should know.

829
01:06:48,844 --> 01:06:51,016
Good team.
When you goin'?

830
01:06:53,849 --> 01:06:55,177
Tomorrow.

831
01:06:59,521 --> 01:07:01,099
We play Chicago Sunday.

832
01:07:02,524 --> 01:07:03,687
I know.

833
01:07:07,195 --> 01:07:08,951
Well, then we'll just have to beat you.

834
01:07:13,201 --> 01:07:14,696
Not likely.

835
01:08:53,844 --> 01:08:56,938
- This ought to be good.
- Nice turnout.

836
01:09:05,982 --> 01:09:08,907
Gentlemen, thank you very much
for coming out this morning.

837
01:09:09,193 --> 01:09:12,396
I will be brief.
Two days ago, "The Tribune"

838
01:09:12,488 --> 01:09:16,817
made a salacious and quite outrageous
accusation that my client,

839
01:09:16,909 --> 01:09:19,198
Carter Rutherford,
a great war hero,

840
01:09:19,287 --> 01:09:22,122
was less than truthful
about his service to his country.

841
01:09:22,206 --> 01:09:24,282
They produced one witness.

842
01:09:24,375 --> 01:09:29,915
Anonymous. One man,
who'd served alongside Carter on the frontlines.

843
01:09:30,006 --> 01:09:32,561
The only other corroborating story
came from...

844
01:09:32,717 --> 01:09:36,845
Miss Lexie Littleton,
who claimed that Carter confessed to her

845
01:09:36,929 --> 01:09:39,743
that his war story was a lie.

846
01:09:39,743 --> 01:09:42,263
However, I have with me today

847
01:09:42,351 --> 01:09:46,135
Mr. Mack Steiner,
a veteran of the Great War.

848
01:09:46,230 --> 01:09:48,170
Mr. Steiner, please.

849
01:09:53,196 --> 01:09:56,944
Hello.
My name is lieutenant Mack Steiner.

850
01:09:57,033 --> 01:09:59,262
I am a veteran of the Great War.

851
01:09:59,535 --> 01:10:02,959
I also... served
with Mr. Rutherford in that war.

852
01:10:03,289 --> 01:10:05,968
And I think what would be
of most interest to you

853
01:10:05,968 --> 01:10:11,391
is that I am the source "The Tribune"
has quoted in its damning article.

854
01:10:12,465 --> 01:10:15,916
And all I can tell you is that article,
written by Miss Littleton,

855
01:10:16,010 --> 01:10:20,513
is filled with half-truths
and exaggerated facts.

856
01:10:22,392 --> 01:10:23,865
The whole truth...

857
01:10:24,561 --> 01:10:28,080
is that Mr. Rutherford...
is a war hero.

858
01:10:28,398 --> 01:10:30,390
And I... was honored
to serve with him!

859
01:10:31,192 --> 01:10:34,374
So, who got to you, Mack?
How much you getting paid?

860
01:10:34,988 --> 01:10:36,150
Once again we...

861
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:38,126
How much you getting paid, huh, Mack?

862
01:10:40,368 --> 01:10:43,488
We demand that "The Tribune"
issue an apology

863
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:46,754
and recant this story immediately!

864
01:10:46,833 --> 01:10:50,654
Come back, Miss Littleton!
Come back and face your critics!

865
01:10:52,714 --> 01:10:56,744
Ladies and gentlemen!
Ladies and gentlemen!

866
01:10:57,427 --> 01:11:00,729
Mornin', folks.
My name is Pete Harpen.

867
01:11:01,473 --> 01:11:04,178
I was a prosecutor
for the State of Wisconsin

868
01:11:04,267 --> 01:11:05,953
until 10:00 a.m. this mornin'.

869
01:11:06,269 --> 01:11:10,882
At that time, Congress appointed me
the Commissioner of Professional Football.

870
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:13,936
This new job will start immediately,
and my first charge

871
01:11:14,027 --> 01:11:17,530
will be to get to the bottom of this scandal,
and then move on.

872
01:11:17,666 --> 01:11:23,306
That means... rules adhered to,
codes of ethics, owners, players...

873
01:11:23,306 --> 01:11:27,885
Everything pertaining to football
will now have me to answer to.

874
01:11:28,441 --> 01:11:32,611
And that means right now
"The Chicago Tribune" has me to answer to.

875
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:36,363
So, fellas,
I think this press conference is concluded.

876
01:11:41,013 --> 01:11:42,555
It doesn't matter.
You're writing a retraction.

877
01:11:42,639 --> 01:11:45,676
- But I didn't make it up. The story's true.
- That part doesn't matter.

878
01:11:45,767 --> 01:11:47,641
There must have been
nine or ten other soldiers there.

879
01:11:47,728 --> 01:11:48,890
Gimme a chance to round them up.

880
01:11:48,979 --> 01:11:52,063
Mickey already found five or six. You got
private Mike Stone, private Henry Maggio...

881
01:11:52,149 --> 01:11:54,272
- They all say none of them will talk.
- Little more time, Harvey.

882
01:11:54,359 --> 01:11:57,396
Well, I'll get somebody.
I'll find a couple of those krauts if I have to.

883
01:11:57,487 --> 01:11:59,112
We don't have the time,
goddamn it.

884
01:11:59,198 --> 01:12:00,491
We're cuttin' our losses
and gettin' out.

885
01:12:00,491 --> 01:12:03,482
Well, I'm not gonna write it. You can grab
one o' these clowns if you want to,

886
01:12:03,577 --> 01:12:05,320
but I'm the one
getting my wings clipped.

887
01:12:05,412 --> 01:12:07,156
Sorry, Harvey.
Lexie, there's somebody here to see you.

888
01:12:07,247 --> 01:12:09,343
- Who?
- Dodge Connelly.

889
01:12:11,335 --> 01:12:12,724
Tell him I'm not here.

890
01:12:13,086 --> 01:12:14,395
I heard that!

891
01:12:16,507 --> 01:12:18,032
Goddamn it!

892
01:12:19,343 --> 01:12:22,807
You know, Dodge, you've got a knack
for showing up at the perfect time.

893
01:12:22,930 --> 01:12:25,765
- Some call it a skill.
- Did you come to gloat?

894
01:12:25,849 --> 01:12:29,495
- I was just in the neighborhood.
- Chicago. Just out for a stroll?

895
01:12:33,399 --> 01:12:36,528
- Can I talk to you in private?
- Fine.

896
01:12:37,611 --> 01:12:40,565
- So, ready for the big game Sunday?
- Not really.

897
01:12:40,656 --> 01:12:43,823
Queer, you saying that.
I've never known you to quit before a game.

898
01:12:43,951 --> 01:12:45,611
Well, we got ourselves
a new football commissioner.

899
01:12:45,703 --> 01:12:46,865
He doesn't like
the way we play the game.

900
01:12:46,954 --> 01:12:48,863
Oh, I know your new appointee.

901
01:12:48,956 --> 01:12:53,045
I've been called to the carpet.
I gotta go in tomorrow and lay before the king.

902
01:12:53,252 --> 01:12:55,921
- You get to keep your job?
- If I play by their rules.

903
01:12:56,130 --> 01:12:59,914
So, play by their rules. It's fourth down.
Punt, you'll get the ball back.

904
01:13:00,009 --> 01:13:01,384
- Punt?
- That's what I'd do.

905
01:13:01,468 --> 01:13:02,631
You would, would you?

906
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:04,222
Cause you get 'im again
next Sunday.

907
01:13:04,222 --> 01:13:07,347
You go find the rest o' the soldiers,
and you get the real story.

908
01:13:07,433 --> 01:13:10,443
We called them all.
None of them will go on the record.

909
01:13:10,728 --> 01:13:14,527
So, now what, Mr. Newspaper Man?
Statue of Liberty play?

910
01:13:14,815 --> 01:13:18,326
- Quit.
- Quit? And do what, Dodge?

911
01:13:19,445 --> 01:13:22,232
- Get married.
- Oh, there's a fine idea.

912
01:13:22,323 --> 01:13:24,896
Can't make it in the big tough man's world,
so get out.

913
01:13:24,992 --> 01:13:26,451
And who should I marry, Dodge?

914
01:13:26,535 --> 01:13:29,026
- A farmer? Be a milkmaid?
- No' wrong with football players.

915
01:13:29,121 --> 01:13:30,913
Nothing wrong with them?
There's nothing right with them.

916
01:13:30,998 --> 01:13:32,790
Grown men in tights and headgear.

917
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:34,417
Is that what you came down here for,
Dodge?

918
01:13:34,502 --> 01:13:37,171
Just sweep me away from all of
this dull newspaper stuff to get married?

919
01:13:37,255 --> 01:13:39,822
- As a matter of fact it was.
- Well, tomorrow I've got, it's...

920
01:13:42,885 --> 01:13:44,214
It was?

921
01:13:46,931 --> 01:13:49,742
Lexie!
Carter Rutherford on the line for you.

922
01:13:53,396 --> 01:13:54,780
Lexie?

923
01:14:00,778 --> 01:14:02,546
Should I tell 'im you're busy?

924
01:14:10,621 --> 01:14:11,950
You're busy.

925
01:14:24,802 --> 01:14:27,061
Oh, nuts.

926
01:14:35,104 --> 01:14:36,515
This better be good.

927
01:14:39,317 --> 01:14:41,026
Sure is a mess.

928
01:14:42,195 --> 01:14:43,822
Gonna get worse.

929
01:14:44,072 --> 01:14:45,400
<i>For somebody.</i>

930
01:14:45,490 --> 01:14:47,171
Is that what you wanted to say?

931
01:14:50,370 --> 01:14:51,864
Probably not.

932
01:14:53,957 --> 01:14:55,916
I'll see you at the hearing, Carter.

933
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:58,233
I'm sure
you'll get everything you want.

934
01:14:59,587 --> 01:15:01,165
Probably not.

935
01:15:18,607 --> 01:15:20,267
A shot of whiskey, please.

936
01:15:26,489 --> 01:15:27,818
What do you think?

937
01:15:28,909 --> 01:15:30,005
About...?

938
01:15:31,369 --> 01:15:33,777
We got a shot
at beating Chicago now?

939
01:15:34,497 --> 01:15:36,975
Are you kidding?
We had them beaten when we pulled in.

940
01:15:37,959 --> 01:15:38,894
Yup.

941
01:15:40,545 --> 01:15:44,210
How about that Lexie?
Who'd have thought it?

942
01:15:45,091 --> 01:15:46,502
Not me.

943
01:15:47,636 --> 01:15:49,117
I liked her, too.

944
01:15:49,554 --> 01:15:51,026
Stand ready, boys.

945
01:15:57,896 --> 01:16:01,894
Say, Mac. Gimme some beers
and a bottle of your second-finest bourbon.

946
01:16:05,904 --> 01:16:06,935
Thank you.

947
01:16:07,614 --> 01:16:10,324
A toast! A toast!

948
01:16:10,659 --> 01:16:12,829
To the greatest football team
in the world!

949
01:16:13,495 --> 01:16:16,507
- Chicago!
- To Chicago!

950
01:16:18,250 --> 01:16:19,910
To the Bulldogs!

951
01:16:21,128 --> 01:16:23,553
To the greatest game in the world!

952
01:16:29,428 --> 01:16:32,396
Get the hell off me,
shit for brains!

953
01:16:33,098 --> 01:16:36,274
Put the boy down, asshole.

954
01:16:42,733 --> 01:16:44,489
We were just horsin' around.

955
01:16:45,194 --> 01:16:48,282
There's no need to call
people names..., grandpa.

956
01:17:02,878 --> 01:17:04,897
Now, I appreciate that
you fellows are in uniform,

957
01:17:04,897 --> 01:17:09,414
so... I'm gonna give you an opportunity
to extract yourself from this situation.

958
01:17:09,510 --> 01:17:12,317
- To do what?
- Back off the throttle, kid.

959
01:17:13,806 --> 01:17:16,029
I sure do hate to hit an old man.

960
01:17:43,836 --> 01:17:45,148
Sorry, Dodge.

961
01:17:49,008 --> 01:17:50,668
Hey, Dodge!

962
01:17:52,303 --> 01:17:55,890
- Eddie?
- Jesus, it's been years. You look great!

963
01:17:56,265 --> 01:17:57,925
You do, too.
You still in uniform?

964
01:17:58,017 --> 01:17:59,677
I'm a sergeant now.
No more taking orders.

965
01:17:59,936 --> 01:18:03,636
Hey, Frankie, this is Dodge Connelly.
We fought in France together.

966
01:18:03,731 --> 01:18:06,483
- You don't say. Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

967
01:18:06,943 --> 01:18:07,974
Yeah.

968
01:18:08,444 --> 01:18:10,188
So, what are you doin' in town?

969
01:18:10,279 --> 01:18:12,605
Ah, we're off to China in a week.
Thought we'd hit the town.

970
01:18:12,698 --> 01:18:13,979
This is the best spot.

971
01:18:15,201 --> 01:18:19,068
<i>Over there, over there</i>

972
01:18:19,455 --> 01:18:23,370
<i>Send the word, send the word over there</i>

973
01:18:23,751 --> 01:18:28,413
<i>That the Yanks are comin'
The Yanks are comin'</i>

974
01:18:28,506 --> 01:18:32,551
<i>The drums rum-tummin' everywhere</i>

975
01:18:32,635 --> 01:18:34,794
<i>So prepare</i>

976
01:18:34,887 --> 01:18:36,322
When you shippin' out?

977
01:18:36,723 --> 01:18:40,111
Friday. We're gonna hit all the joints
and try to get in the game in the mornin'.

978
01:18:41,310 --> 01:18:43,636
You know, Eddie,
I play for the Bulldogs.

979
01:18:43,730 --> 01:18:46,137
I know, Dodge.
Everybody knows.

980
01:18:46,232 --> 01:18:48,723
They do?
What do they say about me?

981
01:18:48,818 --> 01:18:51,736
They like you,
but the game's changin'.

982
01:18:51,821 --> 01:18:54,069
Yeah. For the better?

983
01:18:54,365 --> 01:18:59,089
Don't know. I do know we like the Bullet.
He plays for us now.

984
01:18:59,204 --> 01:19:02,163
Yeah. He's a hell of a player.

985
01:19:02,624 --> 01:19:04,865
And a war hero,
no thanks to "The Tribune".

986
01:19:04,959 --> 01:19:09,004
<i>We'll be over, we're comin' over</i>

987
01:19:09,172 --> 01:19:15,886
<i>And we won't come back till it's over
over there</i>

988
01:19:16,179 --> 01:19:17,507
What time is it?

989
01:19:18,348 --> 01:19:19,842
6:00 a.m.

990
01:19:20,767 --> 01:19:23,411
Eddie, you want to get your boys
in the game this afternoon?

991
01:19:24,229 --> 01:19:25,343
Do I?

992
01:19:25,438 --> 01:19:28,875
Can I borrow somethin' from you fellas?
In exchange for front-row seats.

993
01:19:29,651 --> 01:19:32,899
Depends.
Just what do you wanna borrow?

994
01:19:33,279 --> 01:19:36,862
<i>The drums rum-tummin' everywhere</i>

995
01:19:37,367 --> 01:19:41,614
<i>So prepare, say a prayer</i>

996
01:19:41,955 --> 01:19:46,368
<i>Send the word, send the word to beware</i>

997
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:52,167
<i>We'll be over, we're comin' over</i>

998
01:19:52,465 --> 01:19:59,049
<i>And we won't come back till it's over
over there</i>

999
01:20:07,147 --> 01:20:09,228
Mr. Harpen will see you now.

1000
01:20:11,526 --> 01:20:13,452
Funny how things work out.

1001
01:20:14,613 --> 01:20:16,440
New set of rules today.

1002
01:20:17,949 --> 01:20:20,275
Why was this woman put on the story?

1003
01:20:21,745 --> 01:20:23,894
Harvey, I think that question is for you.

1004
01:20:25,374 --> 01:20:27,686
- She's the best.
- Is that right?

1005
01:20:29,086 --> 01:20:30,829
Miss Littleton, are you the best?

1006
01:20:31,505 --> 01:20:33,295
You want me to answer that?

1007
01:20:34,800 --> 01:20:36,211
We'll get back to you.

1008
01:20:37,261 --> 01:20:40,594
Mr. Rutherford, the story of
your accomplishments smells of legend.

1009
01:20:40,681 --> 01:20:43,432
Mr. Commissioner,
the men who served with Carter will back up...

1010
01:20:43,517 --> 01:20:45,080
Back his story? That's fine.

1011
01:20:45,394 --> 01:20:48,264
There were many fine men
who served in this war.

1012
01:20:48,355 --> 01:20:50,578
Let's say you just sit there, C.C.

1013
01:20:51,859 --> 01:20:53,236
I know you.

1014
01:20:57,573 --> 01:20:59,898
Harvey, I want
that retraction in your paper.

1015
01:21:00,993 --> 01:21:02,447
Front page.

1016
01:21:03,620 --> 01:21:07,784
Miss Littleton, you're gonna write it,
or I'll run you out of this town on a rail.

1017
01:21:08,041 --> 01:21:09,749
- It's gonna run tomorrow morning.
- I'll resign.

1018
01:21:09,835 --> 01:21:10,950
That's fine.

1019
01:21:11,045 --> 01:21:13,203
Mickey Patterson from the Metro desk
can write it.

1020
01:21:13,380 --> 01:21:17,164
And may I just add that although
you cannot un-tell a lie,

1021
01:21:17,259 --> 01:21:21,731
I hope "The Tribune" will bend over backwards
to restore the reputation of my client.

1022
01:21:21,972 --> 01:21:23,764
We have many lucrative contracts...

1023
01:21:23,849 --> 01:21:25,509
I'm sorry, Mr. Harpen.
He just barged in!

1024
01:21:25,601 --> 01:21:27,143
It was important for me to be here,

1025
01:21:27,227 --> 01:21:29,897
- since it's my player that's been traded.
- It's all right, Bonnie.

1026
01:21:29,980 --> 01:21:32,352
Mr. Connelly, the Chicago trade
is not one of the subjects...

1027
01:21:32,441 --> 01:21:33,722
Hey, Carter, how's tricks?

1028
01:21:33,817 --> 01:21:35,477
Don't you have a game today?
You look like hell.

1029
01:21:35,569 --> 01:21:37,147
That's because I've been up
drinkin' all night.

1030
01:21:37,238 --> 01:21:40,041
- Say, Lexie!
- Say, Dodge. What are you doing?

1031
01:21:40,041 --> 01:21:41,318
Here's the skinny.

1032
01:21:41,408 --> 01:21:43,484
So, I'm out all night at a joint called
The Green Room,

1033
01:21:43,577 --> 01:21:44,656
where they serve liquor.

1034
01:21:44,745 --> 01:21:46,287
Which is illegal,
last time I checked.

1035
01:21:46,372 --> 01:21:49,741
Right you are, Pete,
and a young cocktail waitress named Ya Ya

1036
01:21:49,834 --> 01:21:54,081
said to send you her best,
which, from what I hear, is miraculous.

1037
01:21:54,171 --> 01:21:56,876
Not key to this story.
My point is, I was out

1038
01:21:56,966 --> 01:21:59,338
drinkin' and celebratin'
with a bunch of Chicago fans

1039
01:21:59,427 --> 01:22:02,096
who also happen to be veterans
of the Great War.

1040
01:22:02,179 --> 01:22:04,219
As what goes on at a place like this,
we get to talkin',

1041
01:22:04,306 --> 01:22:07,011
and you come to find out that
six or seven of these fellas

1042
01:22:07,101 --> 01:22:09,972
served with Carter
when he beat the Kaiser single-handedly.

1043
01:22:10,062 --> 01:22:15,028
Well, Mr. Connelly, we've established
that Mr. Rutherford's war record is intacto.

1044
01:22:15,028 --> 01:22:16,568
Right you are, Pete.

1045
01:22:16,652 --> 01:22:19,190
So I tell these guys
that I'm playin' with Carter later on today,

1046
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:23,276
and they tell me that they really
wanna see their buddy face to face.

1047
01:22:24,702 --> 01:22:26,445
To thank him, I would suppose.

1048
01:22:26,537 --> 01:22:29,111
I can't think of any other reason.
Can you, Carter?

1049
01:22:31,751 --> 01:22:33,827
So, here's the fun part.
I say to myself,

1050
01:22:33,920 --> 01:22:35,711
I say, "Dodge, what the hell!"

1051
01:22:35,796 --> 01:22:39,212
"Carter's just down at the courthouse.
These fellows can see him right now!"

1052
01:22:39,300 --> 01:22:42,586
Well, they flipped. They jumped into the back
o' the truck. They're down here right now,

1053
01:22:42,678 --> 01:22:45,675
in the pouring rain,
waitin' to see their buddy.

1054
01:22:45,723 --> 01:22:47,550
Oh, Carter,
they really wanted to see you.

1055
01:22:47,642 --> 01:22:50,097
There's this one fellow,
I don't remember his name.

1056
01:22:50,186 --> 01:22:53,140
Uh, little guy, he's got dark hair, he's, uh...

1057
01:22:53,231 --> 01:22:54,420
Private Maggio?

1058
01:22:54,649 --> 01:22:56,226
Maggio, yeah. He's a lieutenant now.

1059
01:22:56,317 --> 01:22:59,504
And then another guy,
big, stocky fellow with a crew cut.

1060
01:22:59,504 --> 01:23:01,486
He's, uh, bulky, kind of heavy-set.

1061
01:23:01,572 --> 01:23:03,232
- Stone?
- Mike Stone?

1062
01:23:03,324 --> 01:23:05,483
Mike Stone! Mike Stone.
Yeah, he's put on a lot of weight.

1063
01:23:05,576 --> 01:23:08,530
Pete, come on, let's do a little somethin' nice
for our boys in the uniform.

1064
01:23:08,621 --> 01:23:12,073
Well, let's make it quick. Bonnie,
send those soldiers up, if you would.

1065
01:23:12,166 --> 01:23:16,469
Hey, boys! Come on up here!
He's dyin' to see you!

1066
01:23:17,672 --> 01:23:19,591
- What did he say?
- He wants us to go up.

1067
01:23:19,674 --> 01:23:21,171
Come on, we gotta go.

1068
01:23:23,678 --> 01:23:25,338
Let's go down and meet them.
They don't have to walk up.

1069
01:23:25,430 --> 01:23:27,304
C.C., I'd like to thank
those fellows for their service.

1070
01:23:27,390 --> 01:23:30,557
They shouldn't come in here.
It would be a mistake for them to come here.

1071
01:23:30,643 --> 01:23:32,054
What are you talking about,
mistake?

1072
01:23:32,145 --> 01:23:33,224
Because these soldiers,

1073
01:23:33,313 --> 01:23:35,021
they've been up all night at a speakeasy
with some gal named Ya Ya.

1074
01:23:35,106 --> 01:23:37,145
What do you say we just stop?

1075
01:23:37,317 --> 01:23:39,808
- No...
- C.C., stop.

1076
01:23:50,121 --> 01:23:53,295
It's my fault.
I should have put an end to it.

1077
01:23:54,167 --> 01:23:55,827
Put an end to what?

1078
01:24:02,342 --> 01:24:04,932
It's all true.
Lexie's story.

1079
01:24:06,221 --> 01:24:08,733
And the soldiers down in that truck,
they know it.

1080
01:24:10,058 --> 01:24:12,888
That's why C.C. doesn't want these fellows
to come up here.

1081
01:24:16,398 --> 01:24:18,556
What about Mack Steiner's story?

1082
01:24:22,070 --> 01:24:23,749
I guess C.C. paid him off.

1083
01:24:33,248 --> 01:24:35,075
Sit down, all of you.

1084
01:24:44,968 --> 01:24:46,795
It's funny how things work out.

1085
01:24:49,264 --> 01:24:51,350
Lexie, you and Harvey can go.

1086
01:24:52,267 --> 01:24:54,176
You're not gonna write a retraction.

1087
01:24:54,269 --> 01:24:57,197
I thought you'd see it our way,
Commissioner. I'll get my hat.

1088
01:25:01,234 --> 01:25:02,266
Lexie.

1089
01:25:05,280 --> 01:25:06,609
Thanks, fellas.

1090
01:25:11,245 --> 01:25:12,788
See you, Lex.

1091
01:25:13,539 --> 01:25:15,140
Be seeing you, Dodge.

1092
01:25:23,006 --> 01:25:25,213
I'll be with you in a second,
Mr. Connelly.

1093
01:25:29,638 --> 01:25:33,303
Mr. Rutherford...
you got one play here.

1094
01:25:33,809 --> 01:25:35,351
You go to the press and tell 'em

1095
01:25:35,436 --> 01:25:39,385
you were part of a great group of boys
who fought for their country,

1096
01:25:39,481 --> 01:25:41,809
and you got too much credit.

1097
01:25:44,486 --> 01:25:46,230
You think that will settle it?

1098
01:25:47,823 --> 01:25:51,863
That, and you're gonna donate 50%
of your earnings to the American Legion.

1099
01:25:52,703 --> 01:25:55,704
- Is that before or after commissions?
- Before.

1100
01:25:56,498 --> 01:25:58,989
But that's not gonna matter
a whole hell of a lot.

1101
01:26:01,921 --> 01:26:03,806
Got a new book o' rules.

1102
01:26:06,425 --> 01:26:11,965
"All agents and representatives of players
will be licensed by the state."

1103
01:26:12,056 --> 01:26:13,724
I'm the state.

1104
01:26:14,016 --> 01:26:16,779
I'm the one
who approves your licence, C.C.

1105
01:26:17,019 --> 01:26:18,863
You're out of football.

1106
01:26:20,064 --> 01:26:24,042
- I'll fight you in court.
- You get your lawyer, I'll get mine.

1107
01:26:30,866 --> 01:26:32,444
Good day, gentlemen.

1108
01:26:55,725 --> 01:26:58,184
It is funny how things work out.

1109
01:26:58,978 --> 01:27:00,603
Do you know Chicago bookmakers

1110
01:27:00,688 --> 01:27:04,565
are betting on the game of
professional football not lasting a year?

1111
01:27:04,859 --> 01:27:06,573
Even with Carter.

1112
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:11,243
And then where will all the little boys
who won't grow up go?

1113
01:27:15,244 --> 01:27:17,164
There's always baseball.

1114
01:27:24,337 --> 01:27:26,376
How much longer you think
you might be playin'?

1115
01:27:26,464 --> 01:27:27,333
Why?

1116
01:27:30,385 --> 01:27:33,070
The game of professional football
has come of age.

1117
01:27:33,262 --> 01:27:36,517
Now, we gotta abide
by a uniform set o' rules.

1118
01:27:37,267 --> 01:27:40,327
It's too much,
too much money now.

1119
01:27:41,521 --> 01:27:44,854
No more, uh, no more hidin' footballs
under your jersey.

1120
01:27:44,941 --> 01:27:48,938
No more Pig in the Poke.
No more Crusty Bobs.

1121
01:27:50,196 --> 01:27:54,610
No more all-nights in a speakeasy
with my friend Ya Ya.

1122
01:27:56,077 --> 01:27:58,556
It's time for you to retire, Dodge.

1123
01:28:01,124 --> 01:28:02,784
But you can't make me.

1124
01:28:03,960 --> 01:28:05,132
No.

1125
01:28:06,379 --> 01:28:09,849
But I can fine the hell out of you
till you're broke.

1126
01:28:10,800 --> 01:28:14,465
And if you pull a stunt today,
I'll kick you out.

1127
01:28:14,804 --> 01:28:17,112
- You got that much gas?
- Try me.

1128
01:28:21,728 --> 01:28:23,519
Have a good game today, Dodge.

1129
01:28:24,648 --> 01:28:26,526
Have a good, clean game.

1130
01:28:38,328 --> 01:28:39,491
Thanks, fellas.

1131
01:28:39,579 --> 01:28:42,070
- Doesn't seem fair.
- We never played any game clean.

1132
01:28:42,165 --> 01:28:45,250
- We played Wabash clean last year.
- They only had nine men.

1133
01:28:45,335 --> 01:28:46,913
Yeah, but still...

1134
01:28:56,096 --> 01:28:58,931
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
good afternoon and welcome.</i>

1135
01:28:59,015 --> 01:29:03,013
<i>It is a fine day for professional football
here in Chicago.</i>

1136
01:29:03,103 --> 01:29:07,101
<i>Rain has been coming down in buckets
but, at least for the moment, has subsided.</i>

1137
01:29:07,190 --> 01:29:09,017
<i>That's making
for some muddy conditions</i>

1138
01:29:09,109 --> 01:29:12,276
<i>as the league-leading Chicago team,
with their new star</i>

1139
01:29:12,362 --> 01:29:13,940
<i>Carter "the Bullet" Rutherford,</i>

1140
01:29:14,031 --> 01:29:17,482
<i>hosts the Duluth Bulldogs,
who are out for revenge.</i>

1141
01:29:17,576 --> 01:29:19,367
<i>Field conditions are simply horrible.</i>

1142
01:29:19,453 --> 01:29:22,026
<i>That should favor
the ground game of Chicago.</i>

1143
01:29:22,122 --> 01:29:23,913
<i>But the real story today
is the match-up</i>

1144
01:29:23,999 --> 01:29:26,916
<i>between the Bullet
and old team-mate Dodge Connelly.</i>

1145
01:29:27,002 --> 01:29:30,086
<i>And we're proud to bring you
all the action live on the radio.</i>

1146
01:29:30,172 --> 01:29:33,790
Joining me in the broadcast booth
is Saul Keller, our sound engineer.

1147
01:29:33,884 --> 01:29:36,838
And we remind you that our program
is brought to you in part by

1148
01:29:36,929 --> 01:29:39,301
Coca-Cola,
"Delicious and refreshing",

1149
01:29:39,389 --> 01:29:42,059
and... Standard Motor Gasoline.

1150
01:29:58,575 --> 01:30:00,534
Go home, you bums!

1151
01:30:06,500 --> 01:30:09,667
I hope Big Gus didn't stretch
your uniform out too bad, Eddie.

1152
01:30:09,753 --> 01:30:11,082
Lose this one for us,
will you, Dodge?

1153
01:30:12,172 --> 01:30:13,719
We just might.

1154
01:30:54,382 --> 01:30:57,793
- Never thought I'd see the day.
- Times are changin'.

1155
01:30:58,135 --> 01:30:59,710
It's a hell of a thing.

1156
01:30:59,929 --> 01:31:01,756
You can't say "hell" over the radio.

1157
01:31:02,640 --> 01:31:05,315
- Why not?
- Those are the rules.

1158
01:31:05,643 --> 01:31:08,447
- Jesus.
- You can't say "Jesus", either!

1159
01:31:18,739 --> 01:31:21,147
- Say, Sudsey.
- Hiya, doll.

1160
01:31:22,743 --> 01:31:24,202
Hell of a crowd.

1161
01:31:24,287 --> 01:31:25,864
Are you two related?

1162
01:31:29,167 --> 01:31:31,408
<i>Well,
we are ready for the coin toss.</i>

1163
01:31:31,502 --> 01:31:35,582
<i>The two captains, Connelly and Rutherford,
are gonna head to the 50-yard line.</i>

1164
01:31:35,673 --> 01:31:39,151
<i>And who wouldn't wanna be down there
on the field for this exchange?</i>

1165
01:31:46,476 --> 01:31:47,678
Dodge.

1166
01:31:48,061 --> 01:31:49,555
- Fellas.
- Carter.

1167
01:31:49,645 --> 01:31:52,563
Okay. So... the winner of the coin toss

1168
01:31:52,649 --> 01:31:54,974
gets to determine which side of the field
they wanna play on.

1169
01:31:55,068 --> 01:31:59,398
For example, Dodge,
if you wanna play from this end zone...

1170
01:32:01,366 --> 01:32:02,942
Jimmy, what happens after that?
What...?

1171
01:32:04,744 --> 01:32:06,320
It's a new rule.

1172
01:32:12,836 --> 01:32:16,964
Oh, yeah. Okay. Then, the opposing team,
that would be you, Carter,

1173
01:32:17,048 --> 01:32:19,041
you decide whether you wanna kick off
or receive.

1174
01:32:19,134 --> 01:32:21,838
And that's all determined
by the coin toss.

1175
01:32:21,928 --> 01:32:23,173
Who calls that?

1176
01:32:27,225 --> 01:32:28,442
Hell, I don't... I don't care.

1177
01:32:28,442 --> 01:32:31,608
Uhh... Carter, you call it.
You're the home team.

1178
01:32:32,564 --> 01:32:34,271
Write that down.
That's a good one.

1179
01:32:35,275 --> 01:32:36,437
Heads.

1180
01:32:42,991 --> 01:32:44,152
It's heads.

1181
01:32:44,242 --> 01:32:45,321
We'll take the ball.

1182
01:32:48,121 --> 01:32:49,236
We'll take that side of the field.

1183
01:32:49,331 --> 01:32:51,932
Okay, well,
then let's get this damn thing started!

1184
01:32:55,045 --> 01:32:56,836
It's a whole new game.

1185
01:32:57,464 --> 01:33:00,525
- I'll try not to hurt you.
- Yeah, you do that.

1186
01:33:05,055 --> 01:33:09,052
<i>And here we go, folks.
Duluth is set to kick off to Chicago.</i>

1187
01:33:09,142 --> 01:33:11,598
<i>Hardleg Hansen boots the ball in the air.</i>

1188
01:33:11,686 --> 01:33:13,478
<i>And Rutherford snags it.</i>

1189
01:33:13,563 --> 01:33:16,932
<i>He's to the 10, the 20.
Look out, he's at the 30!</i>

1190
01:33:17,025 --> 01:33:19,314
<i>Side-stepped Ralph Banning.
Look at him go!</i>

1191
01:33:19,402 --> 01:33:22,320
<i>He's at the 40, the 50!
He's got one guy to beat.</i>

1192
01:33:22,406 --> 01:33:25,193
<i>Yes, folks, it's number 7,
Dodge Connelly!</i>

1193
01:33:25,283 --> 01:33:28,783
<i>Connelly brings down Rutherford
at the Bulldogs' 49-yard line.</i>

1194
01:33:28,870 --> 01:33:32,738
<i>Chicago fans are on their feet.
Now, that's how you start a game!</i>

1195
01:33:32,833 --> 01:33:33,992
<i>Wow!</i>

1196
01:33:37,671 --> 01:33:41,004
18... 24... hike!

1197
01:33:42,175 --> 01:33:45,509
<i>The ball is handed
off to Rutherford at the line of scrimmage,</i>

1198
01:33:45,596 --> 01:33:49,551
<i>and he's slammed to the ground by
Big Gus Schiller from Penrose High School.</i>

1199
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:54,717
It's a run.

1200
01:34:03,530 --> 01:34:05,855
<i>Well,
after three very safe plays,</i>

1201
01:34:05,949 --> 01:34:08,357
<i>Chicago is finding itself
facing a fourth down</i>

1202
01:34:08,452 --> 01:34:10,029
<i>with 8 yards to go.</i>

1203
01:34:10,120 --> 01:34:13,785
<i>They'll line up for a field goal and
hope to walk away with just three points here.</i>

1204
01:34:14,124 --> 01:34:17,042
<i>That is some well-played defense
by the Bulldogs.</i>

1205
01:34:18,295 --> 01:34:20,833
It's all right, fellas.
We're just gonna wear them down.

1206
01:34:20,923 --> 01:34:24,490
Let's take three and put them
back on their heels, all right? Let's go.

1207
01:34:25,719 --> 01:34:30,558
<i>Hauser is lined up for the kick.
The snap is down and the kick is...</i>

1208
01:34:31,892 --> 01:34:33,056
<i>Good!</i>

1209
01:34:33,811 --> 01:34:35,519
<i>It only took six minutes
into the first quarter</i>

1210
01:34:35,604 --> 01:34:37,644
<i>to get on the board,
and Chicago has done it.</i>

1211
01:34:37,731 --> 01:34:39,107
<i>They lead 3 to nil.</i>

1212
01:34:39,191 --> 01:34:41,729
Legs Hauser is set to kick off
for Chicago.

1213
01:34:41,819 --> 01:34:44,025
Sudsey, can I have
a shot o' your giggle water?

1214
01:34:44,113 --> 01:34:46,823
Yeah, but don't drink it all.
I'm in need.

1215
01:34:48,659 --> 01:34:53,155
Word is... the new commissioner told Dodge
he had to play the game clean

1216
01:34:53,247 --> 01:34:54,788
or he'd kick 'im outta football.

1217
01:34:55,332 --> 01:34:56,875
- Clean?
- Mm-hm.

1218
01:34:56,959 --> 01:35:00,162
No Pig in a Poke?
No Chasing the Cattail?

1219
01:35:00,254 --> 01:35:02,391
Not even a Crusty Bob.

1220
01:35:03,924 --> 01:35:05,394
Christ!

1221
01:35:07,386 --> 01:35:08,800
Sorry.

1222
01:35:09,597 --> 01:35:11,128
Can he win like that?

1223
01:35:11,682 --> 01:35:13,892
Without question, he cannot.

1224
01:35:14,143 --> 01:35:16,930
But... the worst part is...

1225
01:35:17,021 --> 01:35:18,389
boring.

1226
01:35:18,689 --> 01:35:20,978
<i>Well, with 10 minutes left to go
in the second quarter,</i>

1227
01:35:21,067 --> 01:35:25,775
<i>Chicago still leads, 3 to nothing.
Neither team seems to be moving the ball.</i>

1228
01:35:25,863 --> 01:35:28,783
<i>The Bulldogs with just 48 yards
of total offence.</i>

1229
01:35:34,205 --> 01:35:36,470
All right, how many yards did we get,
seven?

1230
01:35:36,499 --> 01:35:37,050
Two.

1231
01:35:37,369 --> 01:35:39,366
- Really?
- One-and-a-half.

1232
01:35:39,710 --> 01:35:42,498
- What down is it, second?
- Third. Third.

1233
01:35:42,588 --> 01:35:44,830
- All right, let's throw the ball down the field.
- Okay.

1234
01:35:44,924 --> 01:35:47,960
Curly, you run down the sideline,
and you beat that dwarf to the 40, okay?

1235
01:35:48,052 --> 01:35:49,131
- Okay, Dodge.
- All right.

1236
01:35:55,101 --> 01:35:58,434
<i>Well, the first half has ended
pretty much the way we started here,</i>

1237
01:35:58,521 --> 01:36:00,350
<i>3 to nil, Chicago.</i>

1238
01:36:00,350 --> 01:36:02,023
<i>And after two quarters of play,</i>

1239
01:36:02,108 --> 01:36:05,440
<i>I guess you could blame
the low-scoring game on field conditions.</i>

1240
01:36:05,440 --> 01:36:07,028
That's all right, Ralphie.

1241
01:36:07,113 --> 01:36:08,599
We can win this.

1242
01:36:08,740 --> 01:36:12,151
They just wanna wear us down,
but we can win this!

1243
01:36:12,285 --> 01:36:14,443
Come on. Tell 'em, Dodge.

1244
01:36:15,413 --> 01:36:17,785
- We can win this.
- Yeah!

1245
01:36:17,874 --> 01:36:20,875
Yeah, Bulldogs! Come on, guys.

1246
01:36:22,128 --> 01:36:24,204
Put it down with the Bulldogs.
Come on.

1247
01:36:24,297 --> 01:36:26,254
<i>Gone are the big plays.</i>

1248
01:36:26,341 --> 01:36:29,507
<i>Gone are the on-field antics
that have made this Duluth team</i>

1249
01:36:29,594 --> 01:36:31,587
<i>so successful up to now.</i>

1250
01:36:31,721 --> 01:36:35,422
<i>So far, the big match-up between
Dodge Connelly and Carter Rutherford</i>

1251
01:36:35,517 --> 01:36:38,352
<i>seems to be little more
than a wrestling match in the mud.</i>

1252
01:36:38,937 --> 01:36:43,729
57... 20... and... hike!

1253
01:36:51,699 --> 01:36:53,609
<i>It looks
like Lake Michigan out there</i>

1254
01:36:53,701 --> 01:36:55,824
<i>and certainly seems
to be affecting both teams.</i>

1255
01:37:04,337 --> 01:37:05,666
Go on in.

1256
01:37:12,637 --> 01:37:14,297
What?
I never heard of that!

1257
01:37:14,389 --> 01:37:15,634
You can't block a man
in the back!

1258
01:37:15,724 --> 01:37:18,484
Oh, you gotta be kiddin' me!
Not even at his knees?

1259
01:37:20,562 --> 01:37:23,951
Pall Mall for that smooth...
go anywhere taste.

1260
01:37:32,324 --> 01:37:34,233
<i>And as we head into
the fourth quarter here,</i>

1261
01:37:34,326 --> 01:37:38,573
<i>the scoreboard still reads
Chicago 3, Duluth 0.</i>

1262
01:37:38,663 --> 01:37:42,531
Today's match-up not exactly
the offensive showdown we'd hoped for.

1263
01:37:42,626 --> 01:37:45,033
More like a muddy snooze fest so far

1264
01:37:45,128 --> 01:37:47,750
as Carter "the Bullet" Rutherford
has a grand total of about 300 yards...

1265
01:37:47,839 --> 01:37:49,381
I can't tell who's who.

1266
01:37:49,591 --> 01:37:52,509
<i>Well, folks, with just
under a minute left in the fourth quarter,</i>

1267
01:37:52,594 --> 01:37:55,465
<i>Duluth is pinned down
on their own 35.</i>

1268
01:37:55,555 --> 01:37:57,215
<i>It's fourth down
at four yards to go.</i>

1269
01:37:57,307 --> 01:38:00,059
<i>The Bulldogs really have no choice
but to go for it.</i>

1270
01:38:03,355 --> 01:38:06,688
<i>Connelly takes a lateral from Zoom,
and look out, he's at the 45!</i>

1271
01:38:06,775 --> 01:38:09,693
<i>The 50! Rutherford tailing him!
He's at the 45!</i>

1272
01:38:09,778 --> 01:38:12,447
<i>Rutherford hot on his heels!
He brings down Connelly</i>

1273
01:38:12,864 --> 01:38:16,149
<i>on the 38-yard line of Chicago!
How about that?</i>

1274
01:38:16,869 --> 01:38:20,202
<i>Time-out on the field now,
and these fans are not happy.</i>

1275
01:38:20,289 --> 01:38:22,543
<i>And they're letting Rutherford
and his boys know.</i>

1276
01:38:25,210 --> 01:38:27,949
- How many time-outs we got left?
- Two.

1277
01:38:28,547 --> 01:38:30,919
Two? Good.
We got time for two more plays.

1278
01:38:31,008 --> 01:38:32,122
We're gonna take it
down the right side,

1279
01:38:32,217 --> 01:38:34,376
we're gonna get it out of bounds
and stop the clock.

1280
01:38:34,470 --> 01:38:36,934
Get about 8 more yards,
then Hardleg can tie this thing up.

1281
01:38:42,394 --> 01:38:43,554
What?

1282
01:38:44,897 --> 01:38:46,905
Let's just beat 'em now, Dodge.

1283
01:39:27,440 --> 01:39:29,178
You guys havin' fun?

1284
01:39:31,944 --> 01:39:33,143
Heck, yeah.

1285
01:39:37,867 --> 01:39:41,075
Okay, goddamn it.
Let's beat 'em now.

1286
01:39:41,537 --> 01:39:44,778
I got a new play.
It's called the Sergeant York.

1287
01:40:01,224 --> 01:40:03,631
Listen up, watch the wing.
Nobody gets out o' bounds.

1288
01:40:05,686 --> 01:40:08,687
15... 33... hike!

1289
01:40:10,483 --> 01:40:13,056
<i>Bulldogs run
a sweep to the right side of the field,</i>

1290
01:40:13,152 --> 01:40:14,952
<i>and that's not fooling anyone.</i>

1291
01:40:32,255 --> 01:40:33,500
- Stretcher!
- Stretcher!

1292
01:40:33,589 --> 01:40:35,997
<i>And there
seems to be an injury on the field.</i>

1293
01:40:36,092 --> 01:40:38,583
A Duluth player,
can't quite make out which one.

1294
01:40:38,678 --> 01:40:41,003
They're gonna bring
the stretcher out to pick 'im up,

1295
01:40:41,097 --> 01:40:43,505
<i>but, boy, you hate to see that,
especially so late in the game.</i>

1296
01:40:43,600 --> 01:40:45,592
<i>Just 15 seconds left to go here.</i>

1297
01:40:45,685 --> 01:40:49,386
<i>That's bad luck for coach Ferguson, too.
He's down to just 10 players.</i>

1298
01:40:49,480 --> 01:40:50,943
You need another player.

1299
01:40:51,274 --> 01:40:53,895
Well, that's all we got.
We'll go with 10.

1300
01:40:53,985 --> 01:40:56,684
<i>And that's gonna cost 'im
one of his time-outs.</i>

1301
01:40:56,946 --> 01:40:58,895
See if you can see
which player that is.

1302
01:41:00,617 --> 01:41:02,111
Where's Dodge?

1303
01:41:02,202 --> 01:41:05,156
No time on the clock!
Watch that line. Nobody gets out of bounds!

1304
01:41:05,246 --> 01:41:07,488
Watch that line.
Nobody gets out of bounds!

1305
01:41:11,461 --> 01:41:12,659
Nine!

1306
01:41:14,339 --> 01:41:15,872
Twenty-one!

1307
01:41:17,217 --> 01:41:19,663
Here we go! No time left!
This is it, boys!

1308
01:41:26,643 --> 01:41:29,181
<i>And Zoom takes the snap.
And here comes Chicago.</i>

1309
01:41:29,646 --> 01:41:32,267
<i>He looks down the field.
He's still looking.</i>

1310
01:41:32,357 --> 01:41:34,314
<i>All the receivers are well covered.</i>

1311
01:41:34,401 --> 01:41:37,236
<i>Zoom slides left,
almost gets tackled by his own player!</i>

1312
01:41:37,696 --> 01:41:41,532
<i>Rutherford has him in his sights!
There's the gun! No time left!</i>

1313
01:41:43,827 --> 01:41:45,903
<i>Zoom throws up a Hail Mary!</i>

1314
01:41:45,996 --> 01:41:47,787
<i>The ball's in the air.</i>

1315
01:41:48,582 --> 01:41:49,661
<i>And...</i>

1316
01:41:52,682 --> 01:41:56,704
<i>Ohh! It popped right out o'
the hands of Bakes Davis!</i>

1317
01:41:56,798 --> 01:42:01,623
<i>And I can't tell. The ball is somewhere down
in a pile of some four or five players.</i>

1318
01:42:02,053 --> 01:42:04,457
<i>The referee is pulling them apart, and...</i>

1319
01:42:06,433 --> 01:42:07,382
<i>It's...</i>

1320
01:42:09,770 --> 01:42:12,439
<i>It's intercepted!
It's intercepted!</i>

1321
01:42:12,773 --> 01:42:17,066
<i>Chicago wins!
My, oh my, oh my, what a finish!</i>

1322
01:42:17,152 --> 01:42:22,191
<i>Chicago has intercepted and blanked
the Bulldogs today, and this crowd is loving it!</i>

1323
01:42:22,199 --> 01:42:23,443
Yeah!

1324
01:42:41,969 --> 01:42:44,257
- Where's Dodge?
- What?

1325
01:42:50,060 --> 01:42:54,105
<i>Wait a minute. There seems
to be some confusion on the field.</i>

1326
01:42:56,191 --> 01:42:58,349
Ich gebe auf!

1327
01:42:59,737 --> 01:43:01,646
Ich gebe auf!

1328
01:43:03,115 --> 01:43:04,942
Ich gebe auf!

1329
01:43:09,163 --> 01:43:13,160
<i>It's a touchdown,
not an interception! A touchdown!</i>

1330
01:43:13,417 --> 01:43:16,418
<i>Dodge Connelly has caught the ball
in the end zone with no time left!</i>

1331
01:43:16,503 --> 01:43:19,837
<i>Duluth has stunned this crowd!
The Bulldogs won!</i>

1332
01:43:19,923 --> 01:43:21,715
They won! They won!

1333
01:43:21,800 --> 01:43:24,256
The Bulldogs have beat Chicago, 6 to 3.

1334
01:43:24,345 --> 01:43:27,844
It's a Bulldog victory!
Fantastic finish!

1335
01:43:37,399 --> 01:43:41,016
Dodge caught the ball!
Dodge caught the ball!

1336
01:43:49,537 --> 01:43:51,039
Shit.

1337
01:44:12,393 --> 01:44:14,768
They're gonna kick you out
for that one, Dodge.

1338
01:44:15,396 --> 01:44:16,689
Yes, they will.

1339
01:44:18,232 --> 01:44:19,311
It was fun.

1340
01:44:26,574 --> 01:44:28,079
Take care, Carter.

1341
01:44:29,493 --> 01:44:30,778
Dodge.

1342
01:44:35,917 --> 01:44:37,906
I'm gonna confess everything tomorrow.

1343
01:44:39,504 --> 01:44:41,201
The whole story.

1344
01:44:50,098 --> 01:44:51,129
Yeah.

1345
01:44:54,477 --> 01:44:59,056
I was with sergeant York that day that
he took out 30 Germans single-handedly.

1346
01:44:59,899 --> 01:45:02,568
He got a lot o' them.
I got a few myself.

1347
01:45:04,445 --> 01:45:06,862
We like our heroes, Carter.

1348
01:45:10,285 --> 01:45:12,194
- You just made that up.
- Yes, I did.

1349
01:45:22,547 --> 01:45:23,801
Be seein' you.

1350
01:45:58,249 --> 01:46:00,657
So, I'm working on my lead story
for tomorrow.

1351
01:46:02,045 --> 01:46:03,373
Headline's something about

1352
01:46:03,463 --> 01:46:06,547
a single man taking on
an entire team by himself.

1353
01:46:06,633 --> 01:46:09,420
Well... There were other players
on my team.

1354
01:46:09,511 --> 01:46:11,122
I was talking about Carter.

1355
01:46:12,180 --> 01:46:13,812
So, you're a sportswriter now.

1356
01:46:14,516 --> 01:46:15,922
Why not?

1357
01:46:15,922 --> 01:46:18,052
Well, certain jobs are always
gonna be done by men.

1358
01:46:18,728 --> 01:46:21,729
Big, strapping men? What else?

1359
01:46:22,190 --> 01:46:24,515
Auto mechanics, plumbers...

1360
01:46:25,026 --> 01:46:26,664
Motorcycles?

1361
01:46:27,362 --> 01:46:28,270
You wanna drive?

1362
01:46:29,698 --> 01:46:32,699
Hop on, Mr. Connelly.
I'll buy you a soda pop.

1363
01:46:54,598 --> 01:46:56,507
Worried about your reputation?

1364
01:47:00,437 --> 01:47:02,264
As a matter of fact, I am.

1365
01:47:16,912 --> 01:47:19,239
The trick is to hang on.

1366
01:47:25,170 --> 01:47:27,795
What will become of us, Dodge?

1367
01:47:28,465 --> 01:47:32,130
Ride off into the sunset?
Live happily ever after?

1368
01:47:32,594 --> 01:47:34,753
- Well, marriage.
- Course.

1369
01:47:34,847 --> 01:47:37,682
- Kids, I suppose.
- Naturally.

1370
01:47:38,100 --> 01:47:40,930
- I guess some sort o' scandal.
- Hmm...

1371
01:47:41,603 --> 01:47:43,968
- Taxes, maybe.
- Lose all our money.

1372
01:47:44,106 --> 01:47:45,731
Oh, the family home?

1373
01:47:45,816 --> 01:47:47,476
Then, after a brief turn in jail...

1374
01:47:47,860 --> 01:47:50,013
- Ooh, you'll like it there!
- Not me, you.

1375
01:47:52,531 --> 01:47:55,731
- Quickly followed by dementia.
- What was your name, again?

1376
01:47:56,535 --> 01:47:58,943
- My friends call me Lexie.
- Fine.

1377
01:47:59,038 --> 01:48:01,363
You can call me Miss Littleton.

1378
01:48:01,790 --> 01:48:04,736
That'd be nice.
Well, Miss Littleton...

1379
01:48:05,294 --> 01:48:09,508
You should be warned that the way
you're holdin' me now, you're chokin' me.
