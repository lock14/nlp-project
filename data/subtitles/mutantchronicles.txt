1
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:08,061
<i>At the end of the Ice Age,
the Machine came. </i>

2
00:00:09,033 --> 00:00:12,363
<i>It came from outside.
It came from space. </i>

3
00:00:13,367 --> 00:00:15,094
<i>It came with one purpose... </i>

4
00:00:15,733 --> 00:00:18,325
<i>to change Man into Mutant. </i>

5
00:01:22,864 --> 00:01:24,762
<i>After much suffering and death... </i>

6
00:01:25,098 --> 00:01:27,291
<i>a warrior named Neachdainn... </i>

7
00:01:27,631 --> 00:01:29,824
<i>united the ancient tribes of Man. </i>

8
00:01:31,398 --> 00:01:36,126
<i>Together, they sealed the deadly
Machine beneath the earth. </i>

9
00:01:55,697 --> 00:01:57,686
<i>In the distant mountains
of eastern Europe... </i>

10
00:01:57,897 --> 00:02:00,954
<i>only The Brotherhood,
descendants of Neachdainn... </i>

11
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,855
<i>kept knowledge of
the Machine alive... </i>

12
00:02:04,264 --> 00:02:09,196
<i>in stories, in myths, in the
sacred book of The Chronicles. </i>

13
00:02:15,063 --> 00:02:19,791
<i>Years later, four Corporations
ruled the world. </i>

14
00:02:20,496 --> 00:02:21,962
<i>Mishima in the East... </i>

15
00:02:22,663 --> 00:02:25,322
<i>Bauhaus and Imperial
in Europe and Africa... </i>

16
00:02:26,263 --> 00:02:28,229
<i>Capitol in the West. </i>

17
00:02:29,763 --> 00:02:32,092
<i>Each Corporation fights each other... </i>

18
00:02:32,563 --> 00:02:36,995
<i>for what little resources
remain in a war without end. </i>

19
00:02:39,463 --> 00:02:41,326
<i>On the muddy planes of Europe... </i>

20
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:43,694
<i>the Bauhaus Corporation prepares... </i>

21
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:46,093
<i>for another assault
on the Capitol lines. </i>

22
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:52,488
<i>Between them, beneath them,
the Machine still waits. </i>

23
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:58,561
Keep it up, lads, put a smile on it.

24
00:02:59,228 --> 00:03:02,922
Will you put that
fucking cigarette out!

25
00:03:05,562 --> 00:03:09,551
Alright, you Bauhaus bastards,
what's on today's menu of shit?

26
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,325
Incoming!

27
00:03:18,628 --> 00:03:20,288
Get your lid on, son.

28
00:03:20,494 --> 00:03:21,926
Tuck in! Tuck in!

29
00:03:28,228 --> 00:03:29,318
Keep your heads down.

30
00:03:31,694 --> 00:03:32,682
Enjoy!

31
00:03:39,361 --> 00:03:41,691
Don't pick at it, son.
It makes it worse.

32
00:03:45,728 --> 00:03:47,125
Fucking hell.

33
00:03:51,994 --> 00:03:53,789
All the fun of the fair, eh?

34
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,758
I want you to destroy them!

35
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,217
You will now fight!

36
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:05,917
I want to see only ashes remaining!

37
00:04:08,127 --> 00:04:09,615
Advance!

38
00:04:23,926 --> 00:04:25,415
Is Hunter's patrol back yet?

39
00:04:25,726 --> 00:04:27,692
What's left... sir.

40
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:44,252
More pressure on the exit wound.

41
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:12,615
What happened?

42
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,992
Ran into cog armour
five klicks back.

43
00:05:15,027 --> 00:05:17,355
- How strong?
- Five ATCs.

44
00:05:17,725 --> 00:05:18,850
Shit, a full platoon.

45
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:20,690
We left them bogged
down in the wire.

46
00:05:20,725 --> 00:05:23,384
They called in our position, ran
eight-eighties right up our ass...

47
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:25,784
Once they get through this wire,
they'll be right on top of us.

48
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,651
- Just another day.
- Right, fucking on top of us.

49
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:39,586
Shit, here they come.

50
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,216
I guess dead men don't smoke, huh?

51
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:59,048
Gracias, Padre. I feel
all cleansed and shit.

52
00:06:01,457 --> 00:06:03,423
Sergeant? Would you receive grace?

53
00:06:04,123 --> 00:06:05,555
Top's going straight to hell.

54
00:06:06,023 --> 00:06:08,387
You know your Top
used to be an officer.

55
00:06:09,223 --> 00:06:10,519
A klick and closing, lads.

56
00:06:10,790 --> 00:06:13,017
That's right. We went through
the Academy and everything.

57
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:15,153
They're nearly with us, lads.

58
00:06:19,923 --> 00:06:21,287
Then one morning he woke up...

59
00:06:22,589 --> 00:06:26,113
with an extremely nasty case
of, 'I don't give a fuck'.

60
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:30,754
A fuck about what?
Every yard we take...

61
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:34,312
every Cog we kill, some fat
fuck's stock goes up two points.

62
00:06:36,189 --> 00:06:37,985
But it's not about
the money, is it, Sarge?

63
00:06:38,222 --> 00:06:40,122
Ends up where they give
cash bonuses to officers...

64
00:06:40,157 --> 00:06:41,679
based on body count.

65
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:45,054
Sometimes, I think
you don't believe...

66
00:06:45,089 --> 00:06:48,146
in the righteousness of our
mighty Corporation, Sergeant.

67
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,412
They don't pay me to believe, sir.

68
00:06:52,556 --> 00:06:53,816
Absolutely right.

69
00:06:54,456 --> 00:06:57,580
They pay you to fuck shit up.

70
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:05,053
Down!

71
00:07:10,722 --> 00:07:12,922
Right, ladies...
this is it, let's get to it.

72
00:07:12,957 --> 00:07:14,081
Up you get! Up you get!

73
00:07:15,355 --> 00:07:16,719
Step to it, boys.

74
00:07:17,388 --> 00:07:18,251
Now!

75
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:42,714
Come on, ladies. I want you to
show those Cogs your war face.

76
00:07:43,021 --> 00:07:44,282
Come on, lads, step to it.

77
00:07:44,954 --> 00:07:45,977
Lock and load.

78
00:07:52,621 --> 00:07:53,746
Come on, Chita.

79
00:07:54,254 --> 00:07:56,652
Easy, lads, wait for it.

80
00:07:59,721 --> 00:08:01,016
Easy.

81
00:08:06,987 --> 00:08:08,180
Let them have it, lads.

82
00:08:41,086 --> 00:08:42,643
Incoming!

83
00:08:43,752 --> 00:08:45,048
Gas!

84
00:08:46,453 --> 00:08:49,442
Masks on now! Come on!

85
00:09:41,684 --> 00:09:42,809
Fuck!

86
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,376
For a second, I thought
you were going to shoot me.

87
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:51,346
For a second I was. If I don't make it
out of here, you look after the girls.

88
00:09:53,117 --> 00:09:54,776
Can't I just buy you a drink?

89
00:10:11,783 --> 00:10:13,715
I can't get through to
Betty and Marilyn's fucked.

90
00:10:13,884 --> 00:10:16,441
Take Mary Jane and link
up with Slick Nancy. Go!

91
00:10:25,283 --> 00:10:27,374
You keep that fucking
bonnet on, soldier!

92
00:11:33,048 --> 00:11:34,843
Our soldiers didn't do this.

93
00:12:08,647 --> 00:12:11,238
Fuck, they're in pieces.

94
00:12:12,881 --> 00:12:14,176
Motherfuckers.

95
00:12:30,213 --> 00:12:32,838
Jesus, God Almighty, Christ!

96
00:12:47,346 --> 00:12:48,676
Murderer!

97
00:13:06,479 --> 00:13:07,603
Put down your weapons!

98
00:13:08,446 --> 00:13:10,207
Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.

99
00:13:10,379 --> 00:13:11,605
Has war driven you mad?

100
00:13:11,778 --> 00:13:13,005
My men didn't do this.

101
00:13:13,312 --> 00:13:15,436
- So, you accuse me?
- Yeah.

102
00:13:23,245 --> 00:13:24,268
What was that?

103
00:13:25,845 --> 00:13:26,868
What is that?

104
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:34,043
Get down!

105
00:13:34,078 --> 00:13:35,237
Come on, get the fuck out of here!

106
00:13:38,378 --> 00:13:42,367
Need back-up. 1047, I repeat, 1047...

107
00:13:46,611 --> 00:13:47,599
I'm out!

108
00:13:58,044 --> 00:14:00,566
Motherfuckers! My leg!

109
00:14:00,911 --> 00:14:02,536
Oh, shit my fucking leg!

110
00:14:10,843 --> 00:14:12,400
Nate! Nate!

111
00:14:14,310 --> 00:14:15,639
I'm right behind you!

112
00:14:16,544 --> 00:14:17,567
Nate!

113
00:14:18,676 --> 00:14:19,699
Come on, then!

114
00:14:23,143 --> 00:14:24,234
See ya!

115
00:14:25,743 --> 00:14:26,936
Come on, then.

116
00:14:27,643 --> 00:14:29,836
Come on! Nate!

117
00:14:33,043 --> 00:14:34,838
Ammo's out! Come on.

118
00:14:49,009 --> 00:14:50,998
- You're not going back!
- Nate!

119
00:14:53,609 --> 00:14:54,541
Had enough?

120
00:15:01,509 --> 00:15:04,475
Come on, you fucking beauties.

121
00:15:05,408 --> 00:15:06,669
Come on, now, let's have ya!

122
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:08,632
Where's everybody else?

123
00:15:09,342 --> 00:15:10,672
There's nobody else!

124
00:15:10,909 --> 00:15:11,806
Let's go!

125
00:15:13,842 --> 00:15:18,274
Nate? Nate!

126
00:15:19,141 --> 00:15:20,868
Go!

127
00:17:39,271 --> 00:17:42,704
<i>Before the first dawn,
there was a battle in Heaven. </i>

128
00:17:44,505 --> 00:17:46,733
<i>The Enemy was cast out
and fell to Earth... </i>

129
00:17:47,404 --> 00:17:49,029
<i>an evil star... </i>

130
00:17:49,837 --> 00:17:52,167
<i>broken in body but not in pride... </i>

131
00:17:53,538 --> 00:17:55,662
<i>consumed by envy and hate... </i>

132
00:17:57,104 --> 00:18:00,695
<i>it conspired to remake
man in its own image. </i>

133
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:03,866
<i>And thus the enemy
created a machine. </i>

134
00:18:06,104 --> 00:18:08,797
<i>A machine that stripped the
souls from the dead and dying... </i>

135
00:18:09,037 --> 00:18:12,969
and replaced them with
its own dark essence...

136
00:18:14,737 --> 00:18:17,703
Neachdainn, founder of our Order...

137
00:18:18,937 --> 00:18:21,300
assembled the ancient tribes of man.

138
00:18:22,237 --> 00:18:25,260
<i>Together, they defeated the enemy... </i>

139
00:18:25,936 --> 00:18:29,369
<i>and sealed his machine
beneath the Earth. </i>

140
00:18:35,270 --> 00:18:38,531
<i>The war has broken the Great Seal
and awoken the Machine. </i>

141
00:18:51,836 --> 00:18:56,202
<i>Released from their prison
the mutants dragged every body... </i>

142
00:18:56,237 --> 00:18:58,725
<i>to the pit where the
Great Seal once lay... </i>

143
00:18:59,935 --> 00:19:02,026
<i>and deep beneath the ground... </i>

144
00:19:02,436 --> 00:19:05,402
<i>the gears of the Machine
began to turn again. </i>

145
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:08,468
<i>Changing the dead and the dying. </i>

146
00:19:09,402 --> 00:19:12,561
<i>Mutating them into
the enemies of Man. </i>

147
00:19:38,602 --> 00:19:42,090
<i>Even the power of the four
Corporations couldn't stop them. </i>

148
00:19:46,335 --> 00:19:49,066
<i>The Chronicles promised us
that one would rise... </i>

149
00:19:49,101 --> 00:19:52,658
<i>and follow the path of Neachdainn,
down into hell itself... </i>

150
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:56,201
<i>and deliver Mankind from oblivion. </i>

151
00:19:56,534 --> 00:19:58,363
<i>I travelled to
see the Corporations... </i>

152
00:19:58,868 --> 00:20:01,629
<i>to plead with them
to fulfil the Prophecy... </i>

153
00:20:01,767 --> 00:20:04,426
<i>and defeat the enemy of Man. </i>

154
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,966
How much time do we have?

155
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,028
Days. Less, maybe.

156
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:36,030
Begin the evacuation.

157
00:20:36,733 --> 00:20:38,063
Evacuation?

158
00:20:40,766 --> 00:20:45,130
Move the key personnel
to off world colonies...

159
00:20:45,633 --> 00:20:49,121
and then we can
reassess our situation.

160
00:20:49,433 --> 00:20:51,558
Am I to understand that
you would abandon the Earth?

161
00:20:53,266 --> 00:20:56,061
Yes, Brother. You understand well.

162
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:59,425
We are finished here.

163
00:20:59,732 --> 00:21:01,755
And even with all your ships...

164
00:21:02,533 --> 00:21:05,192
how many millions do you
think you'll leave behind?

165
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:09,662
And do you think that the Enemy
will stop at this world? They won't.

166
00:21:10,398 --> 00:21:11,591
They'll follow you.

167
00:21:13,465 --> 00:21:15,488
They will follow you
no matter where you run.

168
00:21:17,799 --> 00:21:19,424
There is still hope!

169
00:21:27,365 --> 00:21:29,331
- What hope?
- Fulfil the Chronicles!

170
00:21:30,131 --> 00:21:31,960
Give me 20 soldiers and a ship!

171
00:21:32,131 --> 00:21:35,961
And what can these twenty do
that our armies could not?

172
00:21:36,131 --> 00:21:38,397
They can go where an army cannot.

173
00:21:38,432 --> 00:21:41,727
They can go down into the earth.
They can destroy the Machine.

174
00:21:45,664 --> 00:21:49,062
I know what you must be thinking.
You men of science, of commerce.

175
00:21:49,831 --> 00:21:51,456
But I am a man of faith.

176
00:21:51,764 --> 00:21:52,991
And I am asking you...

177
00:21:56,764 --> 00:21:58,286
I am begging you...

178
00:21:59,764 --> 00:22:01,093
Have faith.

179
00:22:02,431 --> 00:22:04,260
Not in me. Not even in this.

180
00:22:05,431 --> 00:22:07,124
But faith in Man...

181
00:22:08,564 --> 00:22:12,462
Faith that the ones you would
leave behind deserve a chance.

182
00:22:24,264 --> 00:22:26,957
- Where are we going?
- Come on. Hold on to the ticket.

183
00:22:29,697 --> 00:22:30,458
Run!

184
00:22:31,964 --> 00:22:33,021
Hurry!

185
00:22:35,063 --> 00:22:36,154
Come on.

186
00:22:50,363 --> 00:22:52,386
Leave it! Run!

187
00:23:13,028 --> 00:23:14,221
That's ours.

188
00:23:15,195 --> 00:23:16,752
There it is. Come on.

189
00:23:23,828 --> 00:23:25,351
Good boy, come on.

190
00:23:25,661 --> 00:23:26,922
Evacuation passes?

191
00:23:28,229 --> 00:23:29,320
But I had two tickets.

192
00:23:30,295 --> 00:23:31,726
I have it here, wait.

193
00:23:32,461 --> 00:23:36,450
- Take the child and leave her.
- Put me down!

194
00:23:36,995 --> 00:23:39,358
- Mum!
- Get off me!

195
00:23:39,995 --> 00:23:41,221
No!

196
00:23:41,895 --> 00:23:43,258
- Mum!
- No!

197
00:23:44,695 --> 00:23:46,126
No!

198
00:23:47,161 --> 00:23:48,252
No!

199
00:23:54,595 --> 00:23:56,026
No!

200
00:24:04,495 --> 00:24:07,086
Who could imagine we should
see days like these?

201
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:09,487
You should have gone, Brother.

202
00:24:10,394 --> 00:24:15,156
The barricades are crumbling...
they'll be here soon.

203
00:24:15,861 --> 00:24:16,959
When do you leave?

204
00:24:16,994 --> 00:24:20,721
The absence of gravity interferes
with my digestion, so...

205
00:24:21,494 --> 00:24:24,426
I shall stay.

206
00:24:26,293 --> 00:24:29,555
Perhaps Man can make a fresh
start on the New Worlds.

207
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:33,085
But they won't need
this old serpent around...

208
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,423
making the same mistakes.

209
00:24:43,626 --> 00:24:44,956
Where will you go?

210
00:24:46,493 --> 00:24:50,187
I shall return to my
brothers and sisters.

211
00:24:52,626 --> 00:24:57,820
How will you get there? The city
is under siege on all sides.

212
00:25:00,893 --> 00:25:02,324
It shall be as God wills.

213
00:25:03,526 --> 00:25:04,957
"As God wills"...

214
00:25:07,059 --> 00:25:09,252
yes, perhaps it will be.

215
00:25:11,659 --> 00:25:15,022
I have a ship. It won't hold twenty.

216
00:25:15,758 --> 00:25:17,418
You'll have to make do with less.

217
00:25:19,125 --> 00:25:21,421
Take these.

218
00:25:22,758 --> 00:25:25,690
- And what are they?
- Off world tickets.

219
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:29,691
They should help you recruit
some men for your mission.

220
00:25:32,592 --> 00:25:34,285
Why are you doing this?

221
00:25:36,158 --> 00:25:41,056
Many men think they are going to die,
Brother. A few of us know it.

222
00:25:42,991 --> 00:25:45,651
And the closer I get to my end...

223
00:25:46,592 --> 00:25:51,081
I find hope is the only investment
worthy of my attention.

224
00:25:53,325 --> 00:25:55,291
Sir! The perimeter's fallen!

225
00:25:55,624 --> 00:25:58,113
They're hard upon us!
Your ship's ready.

226
00:25:58,258 --> 00:26:01,883
I'm staying, but Brother Samuel
will be travelling with you.

227
00:26:02,091 --> 00:26:03,488
Take him where he'd like to go.

228
00:26:03,791 --> 00:26:06,279
Brother Samuel,
we have very little time.

229
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:12,321
God bless you, Constantine.

230
00:26:13,457 --> 00:26:15,753
I sincerely hope so, Brother.

231
00:26:17,924 --> 00:26:19,355
Brother Samuel?

232
00:26:20,957 --> 00:26:23,821
Are... are you the One?
Will you Deliver us?

233
00:26:24,823 --> 00:26:26,619
Pray God that I am.

234
00:27:18,122 --> 00:27:19,917
Do you even have a name?

235
00:27:49,355 --> 00:27:51,048
- Mitch.
- Addy.

236
00:27:53,421 --> 00:27:54,751
Nathan's not here.

237
00:27:55,988 --> 00:27:57,248
Yeah, I know I...

238
00:27:58,521 --> 00:27:59,885
Please, come in.

239
00:28:08,254 --> 00:28:09,618
I'll make some tea.

240
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:13,313
Gosh, you've changed.

241
00:28:14,688 --> 00:28:17,176
How long has it been?
Feels like forever.

242
00:28:19,254 --> 00:28:22,049
- You remember, Grace?
- Yes, Ma'am.

243
00:28:24,287 --> 00:28:27,775
She's ten now... ten years old...

244
00:28:29,254 --> 00:28:32,447
which means, almost five years...
gosh, has it been that long?

245
00:28:37,186 --> 00:28:38,482
Here's your tea.

246
00:28:40,987 --> 00:28:42,509
Nobody told you?

247
00:28:43,587 --> 00:28:45,280
No, they won't tell me anything.

248
00:28:48,753 --> 00:28:50,184
On behalf of the Exec...

249
00:28:53,687 --> 00:28:55,050
Hold it.

250
00:29:02,652 --> 00:29:06,218
"On behalf of the Executive
Vice President of Personnel...

251
00:29:06,253 --> 00:29:10,844
I've been authorized to inform you
that, Captain Nathan William Rooker...

252
00:29:10,986 --> 00:29:12,542
<i>has been declared missing in... </i>

253
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:15,208
<i>missing in action."</i>

254
00:29:18,185 --> 00:29:20,743
I have these dreams.
I could see him.

255
00:29:24,686 --> 00:29:27,516
They're hurting him.
He's still alive.

256
00:29:27,686 --> 00:29:29,242
I know he's still alive.

257
00:29:29,419 --> 00:29:34,181
Listen, if you think like that,
you'll drive yourself crazy.

258
00:29:36,085 --> 00:29:38,210
You've got Grace to think about.

259
00:29:39,018 --> 00:29:41,540
And they expect us just
to wait here and die.

260
00:29:43,785 --> 00:29:46,342
I just don't know what I'm
going to tell my little girl.

261
00:30:15,684 --> 00:30:16,809
Leave it.

262
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:35,945
Sergeant Hunter?

263
00:30:38,217 --> 00:30:42,842
A soldier in your platoon suggested me
your name, Jesus Barrera.

264
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:45,114
El Jesus.

265
00:30:45,883 --> 00:30:47,610
I need soldiers for a mission.

266
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:50,643
A mission to destroy the enemy.

267
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:53,506
What enemy is that?

268
00:30:55,317 --> 00:30:57,044
The Enemy of Man.

269
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:01,007
I don't expect that any of us
will survive, but it's a chance...

270
00:31:02,616 --> 00:31:05,946
a chance to save mankind,
a chance to save the world.

271
00:31:07,349 --> 00:31:09,076
Maybe the last chance.

272
00:31:10,516 --> 00:31:12,880
Well, fuck mankind. Fuck the world.

273
00:31:19,882 --> 00:31:21,143
Fuck you.

274
00:31:25,416 --> 00:31:27,574
Corporal Barrera told
me you would say that.

275
00:31:30,182 --> 00:31:32,341
He also said... how did he put it?

276
00:31:33,415 --> 00:31:36,075
That you needed a 'get
out of hell, free' card.

277
00:31:37,482 --> 00:31:40,642
Well... these won't
get you out of hell.

278
00:31:44,849 --> 00:31:47,212
But they may put you
on the right road.

279
00:32:03,547 --> 00:32:06,207
<i>If I don't make it out of here,
can you look after the girls?</i>

280
00:32:20,147 --> 00:32:21,943
Here, put your hat on.

281
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,944
<i>The tickets were life. </i>

282
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,773
<i>Everyone wanted one, but who
would take such an offer?</i>

283
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,477
<i>Jesus Barrera. </i>

284
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,180
<i>He wouldn't go unless
I promised his mother... </i>

285
00:32:52,214 --> 00:32:53,947
<i>it meant he would go to heaven. </i>

286
00:32:53,982 --> 00:32:56,276
<i>I did. God forgive me. </i>

287
00:32:57,947 --> 00:33:01,777
<i>John MacGuire. The only soldier
who refused the tickets. </i>

288
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:05,404
<i>The sort of a man we should
be saving not sacrificing. </i>

289
00:33:08,446 --> 00:33:13,174
<i>Valerie Duval. A single
mother with sixty-one kills... </i>

290
00:33:13,846 --> 00:33:15,107
<i>so young. </i>

291
00:33:16,279 --> 00:33:17,835
<i>Juba Kim Wu. </i>

292
00:33:18,346 --> 00:33:22,744
<i>When I told him that none of us
would be coming back, he smiled. </i>

293
00:33:24,012 --> 00:33:27,774
<i>Maximillian Von Steiner.
An officer and an aristocrat. </i>

294
00:33:28,278 --> 00:33:31,143
<i>A leader, but would he follow?</i>

295
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:35,408
The Chronicles foretell of
the release of the enemy...

296
00:33:36,412 --> 00:33:39,935
the ruin of the world,
the final days of our age.

297
00:33:41,846 --> 00:33:46,710
But, they also prophecy
the survival of Man...

298
00:33:48,378 --> 00:33:49,843
that Neachdainn the Deliverer...

299
00:33:50,612 --> 00:33:52,736
shall walk reborn among us...

300
00:33:52,911 --> 00:33:54,502
and deliver us from destruction.

301
00:34:01,811 --> 00:34:03,834
It is in the service
of that prophecy...

302
00:34:04,778 --> 00:34:08,733
that we are now irrevocably bound.

303
00:34:21,444 --> 00:34:22,501
Brother?

304
00:34:24,544 --> 00:34:26,805
- How's the leg?
- It's good.

305
00:34:29,577 --> 00:34:34,600
Six weeks ago, in artillery exchange
between Bauhaus and Capitol...

306
00:34:37,311 --> 00:34:38,776
That's your friend.

307
00:34:42,844 --> 00:34:45,575
In the ruins of the
Imperial City of Canaan...

308
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:48,977
there's an old cathedral. It's
catacombs open onto a network...

309
00:34:49,012 --> 00:34:51,636
of subterranean tunnels...

310
00:34:52,143 --> 00:34:57,508
you will travel along these tunnels,
find the machine and blow it up.

311
00:34:57,777 --> 00:35:00,140
Is that all? We just blow it up?

312
00:35:01,109 --> 00:35:02,370
We have a device.

313
00:35:06,109 --> 00:35:07,699
A device?

314
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:13,439
From the first Brotherhood
battle with the mutants...

315
00:35:13,609 --> 00:35:17,769
ripped from the Machine before
the Great Seal was laid.

316
00:35:18,642 --> 00:35:19,972
So, it's a bomb?

317
00:35:21,209 --> 00:35:24,607
We don't know, but we think it is.

318
00:35:25,042 --> 00:35:26,474
You think so?

319
00:35:26,676 --> 00:35:30,130
Our information comes from
ancient schematics, Lieutenant.

320
00:35:30,442 --> 00:35:32,567
Not an instruction manual.

321
00:35:33,075 --> 00:35:36,064
The device is as ancient
as Neachdainn itself.

322
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:40,233
The Chronicles show it placed
in the centre of the Machine.

323
00:35:40,775 --> 00:35:44,003
It's covered in symbols which
we think are warnings.

324
00:35:44,209 --> 00:35:46,606
- How safe is it to transport?
- Does it matter, MacGuire?

325
00:35:46,808 --> 00:35:49,122
You can call me Captain,
Steiner, and yes.

326
00:35:49,157 --> 00:35:51,435
Bombs don't get stable
when they get old.

327
00:35:51,608 --> 00:35:53,107
It's a two stage device.

328
00:35:53,142 --> 00:35:54,573
You carry the trigger separately.

329
00:35:54,741 --> 00:35:56,502
Without it, the bomb's
just dead weight.

330
00:35:57,274 --> 00:35:59,263
- What type of trigger?
- Mechanical.

331
00:35:59,675 --> 00:36:02,436
Place it in the device
and turn it with a key...

332
00:36:02,641 --> 00:36:03,868
which we don't have.

333
00:36:04,241 --> 00:36:06,469
- You'll have to find it.
- Are you kidding me with this guy?

334
00:36:07,708 --> 00:36:11,435
It looks like this and it
should be in the Machine.

335
00:36:12,341 --> 00:36:14,273
And if we can't find it?

336
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:17,001
Then the mission will fail...

337
00:36:17,374 --> 00:36:20,897
and every man, woman and child
on this planet will die.

338
00:36:24,907 --> 00:36:26,964
Why don't we throw it down
that big, fucking hole?

339
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:30,863
The Machine is 10,000 years old.

340
00:36:32,174 --> 00:36:34,272
It has survived earthquakes...

341
00:36:34,307 --> 00:36:36,372
pressure changes, plate tectonics.

342
00:36:36,874 --> 00:36:38,464
Then why the fuck the bomb?

343
00:36:38,807 --> 00:36:44,501
Because, Corporal, one of us will
place the bomb inside the machine.

344
00:36:44,674 --> 00:36:46,537
- The Deliverer?
- That's right.

345
00:36:47,373 --> 00:36:49,100
What pendejo drew that short hair?

346
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,738
I did.

347
00:36:55,307 --> 00:36:59,568
That's a very handy book, but we'll
be doing some killing on our way down.

348
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,437
Does your Chronicle offer
any suggestions there?

349
00:37:05,639 --> 00:37:07,071
I can.

350
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:16,098
Courtesy of the Bauhaus Corporation.

351
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:22,834
Keep to the near wall.

352
00:37:34,072 --> 00:37:38,027
As you can see, individual
bullets are largely useless.

353
00:37:40,371 --> 00:37:41,632
Mutants don't feel pain...

354
00:37:46,772 --> 00:37:48,203
or go into shock.

355
00:37:49,205 --> 00:37:50,694
How can it move at all?

356
00:37:51,104 --> 00:37:53,171
We believe there's changes
to the mitochondria...

357
00:37:53,206 --> 00:37:55,797
which boost myofascial release.

358
00:37:56,004 --> 00:37:58,197
Cut a chicken's head off
and watch it dance.

359
00:37:58,638 --> 00:38:00,103
How did you capture this thing?

360
00:38:00,271 --> 00:38:02,998
Our scientists requested
a subject for tests.

361
00:38:03,338 --> 00:38:05,929
So, we went out with
shock sticks and nets...

362
00:38:07,038 --> 00:38:10,368
the sticks were useless and those
blades tore our nets like paper.

363
00:38:11,104 --> 00:38:13,161
We finally pinned this
one under a tank.

364
00:38:13,637 --> 00:38:16,103
- How many men did you lose?
- I didn't count.

365
00:38:16,737 --> 00:38:18,430
What's the fastest way to kill it?

366
00:38:18,771 --> 00:38:22,533
Catastrophic tissue damage,
automatic small arms fire...

367
00:38:23,038 --> 00:38:26,231
usually a clip or more explosives.

368
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:29,835
- What about Willy-Petes?
- White phosphorous?

369
00:38:48,937 --> 00:38:50,459
And swords.

370
00:39:20,102 --> 00:39:22,034
Help me...

371
00:39:25,336 --> 00:39:27,268
Help me...

372
00:39:27,535 --> 00:39:29,001
There's somebody alive in there.

373
00:39:44,068 --> 00:39:45,898
You'll not receive the Sacrament?

374
00:39:46,068 --> 00:39:47,500
I'm not hungry.

375
00:39:49,368 --> 00:39:50,595
That man?

376
00:39:50,835 --> 00:39:51,858
He died.

377
00:39:52,035 --> 00:39:53,467
Did he say anything?

378
00:39:53,635 --> 00:39:55,100
He asked for forgiveness.

379
00:39:56,101 --> 00:40:00,056
Do you think inside every
one of those things...

380
00:40:01,168 --> 00:40:05,725
I don't know. We can only
pray that God is Merciful.

381
00:40:09,035 --> 00:40:10,466
No days like that.

382
00:40:12,568 --> 00:40:14,000
- Brother Samuel?
- Captain?

383
00:40:15,001 --> 00:40:16,967
This is a list of supplies.

384
00:40:19,534 --> 00:40:21,523
We'll need them as soon as possible.

385
00:40:21,701 --> 00:40:22,900
This is a House of God.

386
00:40:22,934 --> 00:40:24,798
And we're going to
die doing his work.

387
00:40:28,934 --> 00:40:31,127
For one thing,
there is no alcohol here.

388
00:40:31,301 --> 00:40:33,290
You telling me, God don't drink?

389
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:38,931
- That's for Communion.
- This is communion.

390
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:48,796
<i>One last Mass, one last Communion. </i>

391
00:40:53,567 --> 00:40:56,362
<i>Severian, Guardian
of the Chronicles... </i>

392
00:40:57,366 --> 00:40:59,229
<i>prepares to dress for battle. </i>

393
00:41:00,099 --> 00:41:01,565
<i>Bound by silence... </i>

394
00:41:01,999 --> 00:41:04,488
<i>she cannot voice
the pain she feels... </i>

395
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:08,093
<i>for leaving the only
home she has ever known. </i>

396
00:41:59,665 --> 00:42:03,757
<i>And now, I must succeed
where Man had failed. </i>

397
00:42:05,231 --> 00:42:06,254
<i>God help me... </i>

398
00:42:07,698 --> 00:42:09,493
<i>God help us all. </i>

399
00:42:11,064 --> 00:42:12,155
Amen.

400
00:42:35,897 --> 00:42:37,124
It's time.

401
00:42:47,197 --> 00:42:48,686
Juba Kim Wu.

402
00:42:50,831 --> 00:42:52,729
Maximillian Von Steiner.

403
00:42:55,363 --> 00:42:57,625
Valerie Chinois Duval.

404
00:43:09,363 --> 00:43:11,419
John Patrick MacGuire.

405
00:43:16,163 --> 00:43:19,095
Jesus Alexandro
Dominguin de Barrera.

406
00:43:20,763 --> 00:43:21,524
What?

407
00:43:29,596 --> 00:43:31,494
John Mitchell Hunter.

408
00:44:04,528 --> 00:44:06,517
Didn't know there were any left.

409
00:44:07,228 --> 00:44:08,524
Ever used one of these?

410
00:44:09,861 --> 00:44:11,589
On the bat a few times.

411
00:44:29,161 --> 00:44:30,127
<i>Engine one hot. </i>

412
00:44:34,461 --> 00:44:36,654
<i>Engine two hot. </i>

413
00:44:37,527 --> 00:44:39,720
<i>Engine three rising. </i>

414
00:44:41,227 --> 00:44:43,591
<i>Engine four rising. </i>

415
00:44:48,327 --> 00:44:50,656
<i>Stokers, engine two hot. </i>

416
00:44:52,693 --> 00:44:54,625
Boiler one, red line.

417
00:44:55,693 --> 00:44:57,784
Boiler two red line.
Ready for launch.

418
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,924
Sound all clear.

419
00:45:02,260 --> 00:45:06,555
You fought with Capitol's 101
in Africa, under Bishop.

420
00:45:06,726 --> 00:45:07,555
That's right.

421
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:10,521
I was on the other side.
Imperial Eights.

422
00:45:10,827 --> 00:45:11,884
I know.

423
00:45:12,059 --> 00:45:14,423
I'm glad to be fighting
beside you on this one.

424
00:45:14,626 --> 00:45:15,358
Huh?

425
00:45:15,393 --> 00:45:16,791
I'm glad to be on the same side.

426
00:45:16,926 --> 00:45:17,983
What?

427
00:45:20,126 --> 00:45:22,024
- Power up one and two.
- One and two.

428
00:45:27,059 --> 00:45:28,684
<i>Power up three and four. </i>

429
00:46:50,657 --> 00:46:51,782
What?

430
00:46:52,024 --> 00:46:53,285
Your fish.

431
00:46:55,256 --> 00:46:57,381
Kills. Every one of them.

432
00:46:59,223 --> 00:47:00,246
You're the shark.

433
00:47:00,423 --> 00:47:03,514
Death is the shark.
I'm just a guy with a gun.

434
00:47:06,757 --> 00:47:10,086
Multiple contacts
at 0-0-4 and 0-1-5.

435
00:47:14,889 --> 00:47:17,185
Escaping transport. They're
getting the hell out of here.

436
00:47:21,023 --> 00:47:22,784
There goes all the money.

437
00:47:23,290 --> 00:47:25,347
Looks like we got on the
wrong, fucking shuttle.

438
00:47:25,556 --> 00:47:27,147
You were born on the
wrong, fucking shuttle.

439
00:47:28,622 --> 00:47:30,355
What crawled up your ass and died?

440
00:47:30,390 --> 00:47:31,421
Your Mother.

441
00:47:31,456 --> 00:47:33,945
No, my mother's too fat.

442
00:47:34,522 --> 00:47:38,978
But my sister could, she's
as thin as a fucking weasel!

443
00:47:41,789 --> 00:47:44,516
- So, who got them?
- What?

444
00:47:45,656 --> 00:47:47,554
- Your tickets.
- Why do you want to know?

445
00:47:48,822 --> 00:47:50,311
Suicide mission.

446
00:47:51,088 --> 00:47:54,486
We're supposed to die together,
that's an intimate thing.

447
00:47:54,688 --> 00:47:56,314
You make it sound like
we're going to fuck.

448
00:47:56,888 --> 00:48:00,252
You can fuck a lot of people,
you only die once.

449
00:48:00,888 --> 00:48:02,320
It's fucked up.

450
00:48:02,721 --> 00:48:05,187
- What about you?
- What about me?

451
00:48:06,455 --> 00:48:07,887
Your tickets.

452
00:48:12,221 --> 00:48:13,517
Stand behind the line.

453
00:48:14,521 --> 00:48:16,010
Just, just looking.

454
00:48:17,021 --> 00:48:18,578
Look all you want.

455
00:48:18,888 --> 00:48:20,888
Get in my way while I'm flying this...

456
00:48:20,922 --> 00:48:22,285
we're gonna have some problems.

457
00:48:25,421 --> 00:48:26,580
Shit!

458
00:48:27,555 --> 00:48:31,714
- So... where we at?
- Close. Crossing the Median.

459
00:48:32,954 --> 00:48:34,977
Start our descent
into Imperial Sector.

460
00:48:35,754 --> 00:48:37,084
Imperial's bad.

461
00:48:37,188 --> 00:48:39,051
It's bad all over this world,
no matter where you go.

462
00:48:39,854 --> 00:48:42,752
After we drop, you're what?
Off to Mars? Luna?

463
00:48:42,921 --> 00:48:44,887
I already used too much
fuel to make orbit...

464
00:48:45,487 --> 00:48:46,817
much less break it.

465
00:48:47,021 --> 00:48:48,543
So you're fucked like
the rest of us.

466
00:48:48,854 --> 00:48:52,048
Man does everything for a reason,
even if he doesn't know it...

467
00:48:53,620 --> 00:48:57,677
or else, what is he? Just like
one of those things out there.

468
00:48:58,153 --> 00:48:59,585
Just another demon.

469
00:49:01,353 --> 00:49:03,478
- Who got yours?
- I have two children.

470
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:06,013
- You look a little young.
- I started young.

471
00:49:06,454 --> 00:49:10,613
- What are their names?
- Jack's seven, Constance is five.

472
00:49:12,053 --> 00:49:14,287
Getting on the ship, you'd think
they were going on a ride...

473
00:49:14,322 --> 00:49:15,843
they were so excited.

474
00:49:17,686 --> 00:49:19,447
End of the world.

475
00:49:21,686 --> 00:49:24,311
There's this girl,
I don't know her name.

476
00:49:25,553 --> 00:49:27,542
She works at The Pearl,
across from the barracks.

477
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:32,682
She's got this walk, pure
beauty, eyes you could drown in.

478
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,586
You gave your ticket to a woman
and you didn't even fuck her?

479
00:49:35,621 --> 00:49:37,415
I said I didn't know her name.

480
00:49:37,586 --> 00:49:39,211
So, you fucked her then.

481
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:48,242
Another contact at 3-4-3.
This one's closing.

482
00:49:48,618 --> 00:49:49,948
Give them a heads up.

483
00:49:50,885 --> 00:49:53,476
Strap in. I'm about to put
this baby through some paces.

484
00:49:55,552 --> 00:49:58,541
Attention! Transport HMS Tango-6...

485
00:49:58,785 --> 00:50:01,047
you are encroaching
on a military vessel.

486
00:50:01,318 --> 00:50:05,580
<i>Come around till you're heading
0- 3-8, let's take this 0-3-8.</i>

487
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:10,116
0- three-eight, copy? No response.

488
00:50:10,285 --> 00:50:11,910
Plumbers flying planes.

489
00:50:13,018 --> 00:50:14,609
Changing course to 2-8-5.

490
00:50:15,118 --> 00:50:16,607
Two-eight-five, aye!

491
00:50:16,818 --> 00:50:18,478
Diving to 50,000 feet...

492
00:50:18,685 --> 00:50:20,741
Fifty-angels, aye!

493
00:50:26,485 --> 00:50:27,814
What the fuck's going on?

494
00:50:30,717 --> 00:50:32,149
That ought to do it.

495
00:50:32,417 --> 00:50:35,248
They've changed direction.
They're on an intercept course.

496
00:50:37,851 --> 00:50:38,908
Take your station.

497
00:50:39,051 --> 00:50:41,346
- That's a civilian ship.
- Take your station, soldier.

498
00:50:43,050 --> 00:50:44,573
Somebody tell me, what's going on?

499
00:50:51,551 --> 00:50:54,244
<i>HMS Tango-6, you must break off. </i>

500
00:50:56,651 --> 00:50:57,741
Hold on!

501
00:51:04,317 --> 00:51:05,907
<i>They're coming straight
at us, Captain. </i>

502
00:51:06,150 --> 00:51:09,116
<i>HMS Tango-6, break off or
you will be fired upon. </i>

503
00:51:09,250 --> 00:51:11,442
Repeat, you will be fired upon.

504
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:16,174
<i>You must break off now!</i>

505
00:51:20,850 --> 00:51:21,838
Fire!

506
00:51:22,817 --> 00:51:24,112
They're going to ram us...

507
00:51:24,249 --> 00:51:25,146
Fire!

508
00:51:39,383 --> 00:51:40,678
<i>Captain, I've lost them. </i>

509
00:52:00,515 --> 00:52:01,912
Get to the escape pod!

510
00:52:05,048 --> 00:52:06,946
Come on, let's get in the pod. Go!

511
00:52:07,081 --> 00:52:08,808
Let's go, let's go.

512
00:52:08,948 --> 00:52:10,175
Get in the pod.

513
00:52:13,482 --> 00:52:15,004
Go, quick!

514
00:52:15,282 --> 00:52:16,713
Let's go, let's go.

515
00:52:17,748 --> 00:52:18,839
The bomb!

516
00:52:19,748 --> 00:52:20,873
Where's the bomb?

517
00:52:21,115 --> 00:52:23,342
Come on, come on!

518
00:52:25,581 --> 00:52:26,945
Give me that damn thing. Come on!

519
00:52:29,848 --> 00:52:31,143
Let's get out of here!

520
00:52:36,048 --> 00:52:38,014
- Pull the fucking chute!
- It's not releasing.

521
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,005
What are you doing?

522
00:52:41,182 --> 00:52:42,943
Manual release on the outside.

523
00:52:43,081 --> 00:52:44,104
You'll be killed.

524
00:52:54,514 --> 00:52:55,946
Here we go...

525
00:52:58,648 --> 00:52:59,841
Come on!

526
00:53:02,182 --> 00:53:04,773
Pull the fucking chute!
Do it! Pull it.

527
00:53:12,414 --> 00:53:13,880
What's going on?

528
00:53:14,381 --> 00:53:15,813
We're still falling.

529
00:53:15,947 --> 00:53:17,913
- We're too heavy.
- We lost the chute.

530
00:53:18,281 --> 00:53:19,577
Goddam it!

531
00:53:22,581 --> 00:53:23,569
Is there a back-up?

532
00:53:24,047 --> 00:53:25,637
Hit the back-up!

533
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:28,369
- No!
- Fuck, no! Yes, motherfucker.

534
00:53:28,613 --> 00:53:30,476
Pop it now, we'll shred
it like the first!

535
00:53:30,747 --> 00:53:33,179
Open low, it'll slow us down
before we hit.

536
00:53:33,381 --> 00:53:36,108
- Before the silk rips apart.
- He's right.

537
00:53:36,281 --> 00:53:37,712
- What did he say?
- I've got not idea.

538
00:53:38,613 --> 00:53:40,340
- Juba's right.
- Hit the goddam backup.

539
00:53:40,513 --> 00:53:42,261
We've only got one chute left.

540
00:53:42,296 --> 00:53:44,011
We rip that one, we're dead.

541
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:47,075
When we're lower, we'll pop it.

542
00:53:47,246 --> 00:53:49,712
- Hit the god dam chute.
- 1500.

543
00:53:50,113 --> 00:53:51,579
You better be right
about this, Juba.

544
00:53:52,346 --> 00:53:54,971
You sure you know what
you're talking about?

545
00:53:55,146 --> 00:53:58,044
You better be right about this,
you son of a bitch.

546
00:53:59,079 --> 00:54:01,568
244... 152...

547
00:54:01,879 --> 00:54:03,640
- Ready?
- Any time!

548
00:54:03,813 --> 00:54:04,779
Any time now.

549
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:11,538
Open! Open now!

550
00:54:14,946 --> 00:54:16,844
- Now!
- Pull the goddam chute!

551
00:54:38,045 --> 00:54:39,170
There you go...

552
00:54:39,812 --> 00:54:41,573
Come on, give me that.

553
00:54:49,978 --> 00:54:51,239
The Captain's fucked.

554
00:54:59,211 --> 00:55:01,109
We'll cut you loose.

555
00:55:01,445 --> 00:55:03,638
It hit the artery.

556
00:55:05,077 --> 00:55:08,043
If you pull it out, I'm gone.

557
00:55:16,178 --> 00:55:18,041
- Amen.
- Amen.

558
00:55:31,811 --> 00:55:32,970
Sergeant Hunter.

559
00:55:35,343 --> 00:55:40,674
May I ask the borrow
of a grenade, please?

560
00:55:57,243 --> 00:55:58,334
Thank you.

561
00:56:01,943 --> 00:56:03,568
Good luck, Sergeant.

562
00:56:21,109 --> 00:56:21,708
White phosphorous?

563
00:56:21,743 --> 00:56:23,833
Conchita here, she's
a real spitfire.

564
00:56:24,242 --> 00:56:27,003
Just make sure you're not near
me when your gun blows up.

565
00:56:27,176 --> 00:56:30,767
- Where are we?
- Off by 4 leagues north-southwest.

566
00:56:30,975 --> 00:56:33,342
Gotta pass through the city
like the old monk said.

567
00:56:33,377 --> 00:56:34,399
Let's go.

568
00:57:11,074 --> 00:57:12,301
Check your targets.

569
00:57:15,341 --> 00:57:16,567
Two...

570
00:57:38,541 --> 00:57:40,006
Need a hand with that, boss?

571
00:57:41,740 --> 00:57:43,104
Be quiet.

572
00:58:09,406 --> 00:58:11,668
Refugees. Where the
hell are they going?

573
00:58:16,906 --> 00:58:18,202
Hunter?

574
00:58:36,039 --> 00:58:38,451
The current bid stands
at two gold watches...

575
00:58:38,486 --> 00:58:40,864
a diamond necklace, and
10,000 gold talents!

576
00:58:42,572 --> 00:58:45,333
Get out of here, go on.
Clear off, then.

577
00:58:45,905 --> 00:58:49,439
- Going once, going twice...
- I said, get back!

578
00:58:49,474 --> 00:58:52,064
Sold! To the skeleton
in the monkey suit.

579
00:58:57,771 --> 00:58:59,237
One ticket, not two!

580
00:58:59,704 --> 00:59:02,602
- I bought it!
- And she'll show her gratitude...

581
00:59:02,738 --> 00:59:05,602
cleaning my crap
from here to Mars.

582
00:59:05,971 --> 00:59:07,994
Unless you want to
buy another ticket?

583
00:59:08,905 --> 00:59:10,370
That's all my money!

584
00:59:10,704 --> 00:59:12,136
Then fuck off!

585
00:59:15,204 --> 00:59:16,898
Do you know who I am?

586
00:59:22,738 --> 00:59:24,203
That's who you are.

587
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:29,266
Ass, stash or cash!
Nobody rides free!

588
00:59:30,004 --> 00:59:31,833
<i>I want everybody on in ten minutes. </i>

589
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:33,095
We need to cut through there.

590
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:34,793
<i>I want diamonds. </i>

591
00:59:34,970 --> 00:59:37,527
- Good place for an ambush.
- Can't be too many mutes.

592
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:39,297
There's too much easy meat.

593
00:59:40,470 --> 00:59:42,148
All the more reason
for them to come.

594
00:59:42,183 --> 00:59:43,826
<i>I don't care whose... open it. </i>

595
00:59:44,271 --> 00:59:48,033
Come on, show us your money.
It's your life I'm talking about.

596
00:59:48,236 --> 00:59:50,532
Give me that... ah, fuck off.

597
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:52,367
Let it go, Hunter.

598
00:59:55,870 --> 00:59:57,096
We go through the square.

599
00:59:57,737 --> 00:59:59,794
- We don't have time for this.
- Make time.

600
01:00:02,737 --> 01:00:05,100
The next one begins in 5.000 talents.

601
01:00:09,403 --> 01:00:13,096
Save yourselves.
Get your money out, come on!

602
01:00:13,536 --> 01:00:16,025
Any advance on 6,000?

603
01:00:16,236 --> 01:00:17,496
Come on, we haven't got all day.

604
01:00:18,236 --> 01:00:20,929
Price stands at 7,000 talents...

605
01:00:21,069 --> 01:00:23,126
three bottles of very
old Scottish whiskey...

606
01:00:23,836 --> 01:00:24,995
Get out of it.

607
01:00:29,036 --> 01:00:30,300
Let them on.

608
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:31,596
Are you making a bid?

609
01:00:32,669 --> 01:00:35,066
First you take the kids
and then the women...

610
01:00:35,502 --> 01:00:37,468
and then you take the men
if there's any room left.

611
01:00:37,636 --> 01:00:40,965
Hey, Soldier-Boy. The ship
can only carry so much weight.

612
01:00:41,968 --> 01:00:44,059
Yeah? What do you weigh?

613
01:00:45,035 --> 01:00:47,297
- 275kg?
- 310kg.

614
01:00:56,368 --> 01:01:00,062
310, that's two women and
two kids. Come on. Let's go.

615
01:01:05,902 --> 01:01:07,868
- What do you weigh?
- Very little.

616
01:01:09,768 --> 01:01:11,358
Dump the luggage. Take them all.

617
01:01:26,667 --> 01:01:28,065
It's top.

618
01:01:28,334 --> 01:01:32,527
Church, it's not too far. It's just
in the middle of the old city.

619
01:01:34,434 --> 01:01:35,866
You figure out where
we're going yet?

620
01:01:36,201 --> 01:01:37,564
Straight on.

621
01:01:39,101 --> 01:01:41,498
Listen you endanger the mission
again, I shoot you myself.

622
01:01:41,901 --> 01:01:43,332
Why wait?

623
01:02:51,765 --> 01:02:53,061
Christ!

624
01:02:55,698 --> 01:02:57,493
What sort of church is this?

625
01:02:58,498 --> 01:03:00,054
How do you lose a city?

626
01:03:11,165 --> 01:03:13,358
The catacombs lead
down to the Lost City.

627
01:03:23,364 --> 01:03:24,887
There must be thousands.

628
01:03:25,397 --> 01:03:27,955
Each New Age builds upon
the bones of the old.

629
01:03:29,230 --> 01:03:31,219
How many times have
they come before?

630
01:03:32,731 --> 01:03:36,686
They didn't do this, we did this.

631
01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:41,423
We've always excelled
at killing one another.

632
01:03:43,431 --> 01:03:45,294
They would challenge our supremacy...

633
01:03:45,631 --> 01:03:47,823
as the architects of our own end.

634
01:03:48,797 --> 01:03:49,956
Halt!

635
01:04:06,897 --> 01:04:08,192
- Brother?
- Yes?

636
01:04:14,797 --> 01:04:16,387
The Lost City.

637
01:04:18,730 --> 01:04:22,287
That skyscraper, we need
to go down, deep into it.

638
01:04:24,396 --> 01:04:27,595
The City of the Ancients,
buried 500 years ago...

639
01:04:27,630 --> 01:04:28,959
in the Black Winter.

640
01:04:32,695 --> 01:04:35,321
- Holy shit!
- We're being watched.

641
01:05:22,861 --> 01:05:24,156
What are they?

642
01:05:25,828 --> 01:05:27,259
I have no idea.

643
01:05:38,860 --> 01:05:40,190
What's it say?

644
01:05:40,960 --> 01:05:42,653
"Abandon all hope."

645
01:05:43,693 --> 01:05:44,920
Motherfuckers.

646
01:05:47,627 --> 01:05:48,786
No shit.

647
01:05:59,627 --> 01:06:01,183
Jesus, that's deep.

648
01:06:01,627 --> 01:06:03,320
Someone's going to
have to stay up here.

649
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:05,422
We don't want them coming
down on top of us.

650
01:06:06,827 --> 01:06:08,087
I got it.

651
01:06:08,993 --> 01:06:10,653
You watch your ass
out there, compa�ero.

652
01:06:13,093 --> 01:06:14,582
It don't look that safe.

653
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:17,055
Got to pay for those
tickets sooner or later.

654
01:06:18,993 --> 01:06:21,255
Take care of yourself, Juba.

655
01:06:23,426 --> 01:06:26,915
Sixty storeys. We'll go first
and let the others find the way.

656
01:06:28,559 --> 01:06:29,991
Yeah, what do you say?

657
01:06:34,492 --> 01:06:36,651
Brother, alright.

658
01:06:37,426 --> 01:06:40,551
This is the brake. It controls
how fast you go down, okay?

659
01:06:42,192 --> 01:06:45,352
You lift it up and
let yourself down.

660
01:06:46,292 --> 01:06:47,724
Punch it in, you stop.

661
01:06:51,526 --> 01:06:55,014
- That's it. Just take it easy.
- And this?

662
01:06:55,192 --> 01:06:57,249
That's the quick release.
Don't touch that.

663
01:07:01,192 --> 01:07:02,452
You alright?

664
01:07:04,125 --> 01:07:05,385
Let's go.

665
01:07:16,158 --> 01:07:17,283
20.

666
01:07:19,924 --> 01:07:21,550
How fucking deep is this thing?

667
01:07:30,791 --> 01:07:32,882
- It's getting hot down here.
- 40

668
01:07:43,323 --> 01:07:44,584
- Samuel?
- 55.

669
01:07:44,991 --> 01:07:46,014
How far?

670
01:07:47,524 --> 01:07:49,047
- Stop!
- 60

671
01:07:52,357 --> 01:07:54,653
- We're running out of rope here.
- We've gone too far.

672
01:07:56,457 --> 01:07:58,945
It's dark, God, it's dark.

673
01:07:59,657 --> 01:08:00,952
Something's not right.

674
01:08:08,890 --> 01:08:11,220
- It can't be.
- Got anything in that dammed book?

675
01:08:11,323 --> 01:08:12,720
What have I missed?

676
01:08:18,356 --> 01:08:19,788
We got people coming down.

677
01:08:23,723 --> 01:08:26,382
<i>Don't fall behind, Steiner.
It's a long way down. </i>

678
01:08:27,723 --> 01:08:29,382
<i>Yeah, all the way to hell. </i>

679
01:09:13,221 --> 01:09:15,016
Weird sounds down here, pal.

680
01:09:17,588 --> 01:09:20,577
It has to be here.
55, 60 floors down...

681
01:09:20,754 --> 01:09:22,982
there should be a ledge.
It says so right here.

682
01:09:26,021 --> 01:09:27,112
It has to be here.

683
01:09:40,888 --> 01:09:42,751
- Don't let me fall.
- I'm trying.

684
01:09:57,421 --> 01:09:59,353
You are a lucky son of a bitch.

685
01:09:59,653 --> 01:10:00,949
God provides, Sergeant.

686
01:10:09,553 --> 01:10:10,917
God provides.

687
01:10:23,453 --> 01:10:24,510
Close the gate.

688
01:10:25,886 --> 01:10:27,318
Hold up! Hold up!

689
01:10:27,653 --> 01:10:28,641
<i>Coming down. </i>

690
01:10:31,752 --> 01:10:32,945
We got an ugly.

691
01:10:37,652 --> 01:10:40,346
- We're bottled up in here.
- Wait! Use this.

692
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:44,049
Grenade!

693
01:10:54,952 --> 01:10:56,474
- Grenade!
- Grenade!

694
01:10:58,752 --> 01:11:00,183
Don't drop that match!

695
01:12:02,383 --> 01:12:03,940
Go, go, go!

696
01:12:55,549 --> 01:12:57,776
- Any last words?
- Shut the fuck up!

697
01:13:21,015 --> 01:13:22,537
Are you well?

698
01:13:27,815 --> 01:13:28,837
Reload!

699
01:13:37,148 --> 01:13:38,011
Down!

700
01:13:53,747 --> 01:13:55,235
Anybody hurt?

701
01:14:06,380 --> 01:14:08,676
Hey... shit!

702
01:14:16,447 --> 01:14:18,571
Let's go... let's go.

703
01:14:29,147 --> 01:14:30,169
Dead end.

704
01:14:30,312 --> 01:14:32,972
- Anyone got a deck of cards?
- MacGuire.

705
01:14:33,980 --> 01:14:35,275
Figures.

706
01:14:42,746 --> 01:14:43,802
Thanks.

707
01:15:04,146 --> 01:15:07,270
They use tunnels to drag
bodies to the machine.

708
01:15:07,912 --> 01:15:09,901
It takes days, weeks even.

709
01:15:10,445 --> 01:15:12,104
You got a lot of faith in that book.

710
01:15:14,412 --> 01:15:15,934
You're wasting your time, Steiner.

711
01:15:16,111 --> 01:15:18,100
I will not let a handful
of rocks stop us.

712
01:15:18,412 --> 01:15:21,139
- It's a lot more than a handful.
- You find any inspiration?

713
01:15:21,512 --> 01:15:26,001
It's a very good book, but in the end,
even this book, is just a book.

714
01:15:27,878 --> 01:15:29,003
Well...

715
01:15:29,412 --> 01:15:31,707
And I take my Faith
from something Greater.

716
01:15:33,178 --> 01:15:35,371
Well, I haven't seen
much to have faith in.

717
01:15:35,611 --> 01:15:37,907
You have seen the worst
that Man can do.

718
01:15:39,978 --> 01:15:42,739
But you've not seen the
worst the Enemy can do.

719
01:15:45,111 --> 01:15:47,838
- So, who got your tickets?
- What?

720
01:15:49,144 --> 01:15:50,371
Your tickets?

721
01:15:50,544 --> 01:15:53,476
- What does it matter?
- It matters to me.

722
01:16:01,977 --> 01:16:03,409
Who cares?

723
01:16:04,577 --> 01:16:06,099
I'm sorry.

724
01:16:08,277 --> 01:16:10,799
Everything that is, comes from God.

725
01:16:12,110 --> 01:16:14,371
Everything is from God, and of God.

726
01:16:15,309 --> 01:16:18,275
The Enemy came from the outside.

727
01:16:19,877 --> 01:16:22,741
And as God is Life,
the Enemy is Unlife.

728
01:16:23,943 --> 01:16:27,602
It is the end of
every living thing...

729
01:16:27,910 --> 01:16:29,068
everywhere...

730
01:16:29,810 --> 01:16:31,275
and for all time.

731
01:16:33,109 --> 01:16:36,802
And so, I have Faith
that we will triumph.

732
01:16:39,610 --> 01:16:42,337
Because the alternative
is too terrible to contemplate.

733
01:16:43,143 --> 01:16:45,234
What if you don't believe in God?

734
01:16:45,410 --> 01:16:48,171
If you did not believe in God,
you would not be here.

735
01:16:51,342 --> 01:16:53,036
Are you guys gonna help?

736
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:56,364
Maybe you haven't noticed,
but your mission is kind of fucked.

737
01:17:02,142 --> 01:17:03,870
You should have a little faith.

738
01:17:18,008 --> 01:17:19,338
Give me a hand.

739
01:17:28,775 --> 01:17:30,263
Something's down there.

740
01:17:45,608 --> 01:17:46,937
Hold up!

741
01:17:52,174 --> 01:17:55,368
Poor bastards! Looks like they've
been down there for weeks.

742
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:02,197
We mustn't linger here.

743
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:06,804
Where the hell are they taking them?

744
01:18:08,507 --> 01:18:10,666
Hunter? What is he doing?

745
01:18:12,907 --> 01:18:14,839
- Is that...?
- Sergeant?

746
01:18:15,140 --> 01:18:16,731
- Jesus.
- Top?

747
01:18:17,039 --> 01:18:18,062
That's Nathan.

748
01:18:20,173 --> 01:18:21,366
Fuck!

749
01:18:21,973 --> 01:18:23,200
Come on, let's go.

750
01:18:24,806 --> 01:18:26,067
It's just one man.

751
01:18:26,373 --> 01:18:27,702
I know that man.

752
01:18:30,806 --> 01:18:32,272
We have a mission.

753
01:18:46,572 --> 01:18:48,004
Vaya con Dios.

754
01:18:54,906 --> 01:18:56,064
Let's go!

755
01:19:54,637 --> 01:19:56,398
- Nate!
- Mitch?

756
01:19:58,104 --> 01:19:59,729
They got you as well.

757
01:20:00,370 --> 01:20:02,268
Don't talk. I'm getting
you out of here, pal.

758
01:20:05,537 --> 01:20:07,901
- Where are my girls?
- They're safe.

759
01:20:08,337 --> 01:20:09,701
They're halfway to Mars by now.

760
01:20:11,903 --> 01:20:13,130
Ready?

761
01:20:20,337 --> 01:20:22,269
We're almost there, keep going.

762
01:20:29,003 --> 01:20:30,299
What's that?

763
01:20:52,403 --> 01:20:54,198
What the fuck are you doing?

764
01:20:55,269 --> 01:20:56,928
I've got to find another
way out of here.

765
01:21:01,502 --> 01:21:05,265
I'm going to make you a sling...
get you out of this hole.

766
01:21:12,069 --> 01:21:14,899
- Mars, eh?
- Yeah... Mars.

767
01:21:16,035 --> 01:21:18,523
- How do you explain that one?
- I did a deal for a guy...

768
01:21:21,602 --> 01:21:24,568
Yeah, you know.
Save the world kind of thing.

769
01:21:27,868 --> 01:21:29,391
How's it going?

770
01:21:36,834 --> 01:21:38,130
Jesus!

771
01:21:40,467 --> 01:21:42,592
Listen to me. Listen.

772
01:21:44,601 --> 01:21:46,090
Finish your mission.

773
01:21:48,068 --> 01:21:50,727
I can't leave you here.

774
01:21:51,135 --> 01:21:52,430
I'm not asking you to.

775
01:22:06,833 --> 01:22:09,993
Tell Adelaide, and Gracie...

776
01:22:15,533 --> 01:22:17,726
Tell them, tell them...

777
01:22:19,000 --> 01:22:21,727
- Tell them.
- Right.

778
01:22:23,267 --> 01:22:25,199
- No.
- Right.

779
01:22:36,366 --> 01:22:37,593
You remember that...

780
01:23:09,165 --> 01:23:10,256
Help!

781
01:23:11,932 --> 01:23:13,693
The bag. We can't lose the bomb.

782
01:23:18,332 --> 01:23:19,820
Take it! Take it!

783
01:23:22,332 --> 01:23:23,695
Give me your hand!

784
01:23:39,364 --> 01:23:40,625
We must go on.

785
01:23:49,765 --> 01:23:52,788
- We have to go on!
- We're still human, Samuel.

786
01:24:02,564 --> 01:24:04,052
- Thank you.
- It's an honour.

787
01:24:15,697 --> 01:24:16,856
Fuck you!

788
01:24:52,262 --> 01:24:53,751
Oh, come on, give me a sign.

789
01:24:58,929 --> 01:25:00,121
Come on, fucker!

790
01:25:01,028 --> 01:25:01,959
No!

791
01:25:02,562 --> 01:25:03,993
No!

792
01:25:37,695 --> 01:25:39,024
Severian!

793
01:26:09,794 --> 01:26:10,953
El Jesus.

794
01:26:11,560 --> 01:26:12,389
Hunter!

795
01:26:18,627 --> 01:26:20,527
When's the last time you spoke?

796
01:26:20,562 --> 01:26:21,822
I can't remember.

797
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:25,820
I couldn't save him.

798
01:26:27,460 --> 01:26:30,051
They dragged them
all the way to the Machine.

799
01:26:40,093 --> 01:26:42,558
- What are you doing?
- We need this damn book.

800
01:26:43,326 --> 01:26:44,314
It is not permitted.

801
01:26:48,092 --> 01:26:49,191
They took everything.

802
01:26:49,226 --> 01:26:52,215
He kept looking at this
damn stuff. What's it say?

803
01:26:53,393 --> 01:26:54,949
- I don't know.
- Read it!

804
01:26:55,925 --> 01:26:58,721
- I can't.
- Come here!

805
01:26:58,925 --> 01:27:00,653
Look, read.

806
01:27:02,559 --> 01:27:03,751
I can't read.

807
01:27:04,892 --> 01:27:06,188
You can't...

808
01:27:07,925 --> 01:27:10,289
How can you believe in a book
if you can't even read it?

809
01:27:10,458 --> 01:27:14,550
I don't need to read it
to believe that it's true.

810
01:27:19,225 --> 01:27:21,384
- That's the nature of Faith.
- Fantastic!

811
01:27:23,325 --> 01:27:24,951
What do you believe in?

812
01:27:29,525 --> 01:27:33,184
I'm not paid to believe.
I'm paid to fuck shit up.

813
01:27:34,692 --> 01:27:36,248
Are you coming?

814
01:28:08,990 --> 01:28:10,684
<i>Help me, please!</i>

815
01:28:14,957 --> 01:28:16,889
<i>Help me!</i>

816
01:28:17,524 --> 01:28:20,785
<i>Help me, please!</i>

817
01:29:03,256 --> 01:29:05,414
Shit! Duval and Steiner.

818
01:29:32,288 --> 01:29:33,844
Are you guys still alive?

819
01:30:00,354 --> 01:30:01,876
Can you still hold a gun?

820
01:30:02,154 --> 01:30:03,915
Only with my right.

821
01:30:07,521 --> 01:30:08,884
How about a rope?

822
01:30:16,520 --> 01:30:17,747
Just say when.

823
01:31:04,486 --> 01:31:05,952
God damn it!

824
01:31:08,753 --> 01:31:12,480
I think they're coming through.
That tunnel's not going to hold.

825
01:31:23,718 --> 01:31:26,616
These rocks are not going to
hold them away much longer.

826
01:31:26,785 --> 01:31:28,376
Can't you go any faster?

827
01:31:39,451 --> 01:31:42,508
Steiner? Steiner!

828
01:33:39,848 --> 01:33:41,871
Jesus... no!

829
01:34:33,147 --> 01:34:34,442
Hunter?

830
01:34:54,646 --> 01:34:56,236
Are you one of them?

831
01:34:56,480 --> 01:34:58,207
Get that pig-sticker out of my face.

832
01:34:58,513 --> 01:34:59,536
Are you?

833
01:35:00,179 --> 01:35:02,111
What do you think?
Give me that bomb!

834
01:35:05,545 --> 01:35:06,806
Give me the fucking bomb!

835
01:35:15,213 --> 01:35:16,872
Shit! Here come
those motherfuckers.

836
01:36:03,977 --> 01:36:05,375
Anytime!

837
01:36:17,077 --> 01:36:18,940
Put the detonator in the hole.

838
01:36:19,111 --> 01:36:21,202
- You've got to be shitting.
- Put it in the hole!

839
01:36:21,378 --> 01:36:23,241
- Which hole?
- Any hole!

840
01:36:26,910 --> 01:36:27,876
This one...

841
01:36:31,577 --> 01:36:33,600
Piece of shit... it doesn't fit!

842
01:36:37,210 --> 01:36:38,198
There?

843
01:36:58,110 --> 01:36:59,905
- It's not working.
- What?

844
01:37:03,943 --> 01:37:05,909
Give me the pages from the book!

845
01:37:07,076 --> 01:37:08,837
- What are you doing?
- I'm working on it.

846
01:37:14,476 --> 01:37:15,703
I lost my sword.

847
01:37:18,075 --> 01:37:19,234
Here.

848
01:37:44,608 --> 01:37:45,938
Samuel?

849
01:37:46,541 --> 01:37:47,700
Legion.

850
01:37:52,942 --> 01:37:56,135
Severian, no! That's not Samuel.

851
01:38:19,674 --> 01:38:20,935
Duval, no!

852
01:38:26,107 --> 01:38:27,368
Kill him.

853
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:33,799
Kill him.

854
01:38:46,973 --> 01:38:49,405
You are Samuel. It's alright.

855
01:40:04,338 --> 01:40:05,360
That's for Nathan.

856
01:40:06,105 --> 01:40:07,468
That's for El Jesus.

857
01:40:10,637 --> 01:40:12,035
And this is for Samuel.

858
01:40:48,170 --> 01:40:49,294
Jump!

859
01:40:52,037 --> 01:40:53,195
Jump!

860
01:40:56,670 --> 01:40:58,226
Have Faith.

861
01:42:45,767 --> 01:42:47,494
<i>And so it ended... </i>

862
01:42:47,734 --> 01:42:50,461
<i>I failed, he did not. </i>

863
01:42:52,033 --> 01:42:53,999
<i>Apostate, unbeliever. </i>

864
01:42:55,700 --> 01:42:56,995
<i>Saviour. </i>
