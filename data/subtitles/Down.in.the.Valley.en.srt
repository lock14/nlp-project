1
00:00:00,024 --> 00:00:02,166
25fps

2
00:02:47,505 --> 00:02:48,858
Hey, Tobe!

3
00:02:49,425 --> 00:02:51,780
- What?
- Where are you going?

4
00:02:53,185 --> 00:02:56,143
- Nowhere.
- Can I come?

5
00:02:58,044 --> 00:02:59,955
I kinda rather be alone.

6
00:03:00,055 --> 00:03:01,796
Let me come.

7
00:03:02,699 --> 00:03:05,946
- You don't even know
where I'm going. - I don't care.

8
00:03:09,524 --> 00:03:11,024
Okay.

9
00:03:11,124 --> 00:03:12,955
Just don't bother me.

10
00:03:42,302 --> 00:03:44,480
You can't even spit!

11
00:03:50,244 --> 00:03:51,996
Cigarette helps.

12
00:03:54,924 --> 00:03:56,277
Here.

13
00:03:58,083 --> 00:04:01,673
But don't inhale it, just
hold the smoke in your mouth.

14
00:04:03,145 --> 00:04:04,803
Hold it...

15
00:04:05,723 --> 00:04:07,277
Hold it...

16
00:04:08,484 --> 00:04:10,440
Okay, blow it out.

17
00:04:14,324 --> 00:04:15,677
See?

18
00:04:37,794 --> 00:04:40,941
He picks up his bolt,
it's like pretty big,

19
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:43,091
walks over to where I am,

20
00:04:43,191 --> 00:04:45,079
and he stick his hand
off the fence. - Wade's here!

21
00:04:47,684 --> 00:04:49,224
Hang on a sec.

22
00:04:49,324 --> 00:04:51,838
Anyway, the fool
sticks his hand out

23
00:04:51,938 --> 00:04:54,097
and drops it down,
can you imagine?

24
00:04:54,197 --> 00:04:56,897
He smashed the windshield
of a passing car!

25
00:05:03,244 --> 00:05:04,563
Hello!

26
00:05:07,658 --> 00:05:10,034
<i>- Anyone home?</i>
- Hold on.

27
00:05:12,364 --> 00:05:14,270
Did anyone ever
teach you to knock?

28
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:16,357
I'll start knocking
when you start working.

29
00:05:18,544 --> 00:05:19,957
I'll see you later.

30
00:05:20,204 --> 00:05:22,877
I need you to Get dinner for you
and Lonnie tonight, I'm going out.

31
00:05:22,977 --> 00:05:25,922
I can't, April's coming, and in
15 minutes I have to get ready!

32
00:05:26,022 --> 00:05:27,517
She can wait.

33
00:05:27,764 --> 00:05:30,324
I've been with Lonnie all day,
I just wanna go out.

34
00:05:30,424 --> 00:05:32,021
15 minutes wont kill you.

35
00:05:36,755 --> 00:05:39,902
Get chicken for him,
and you can have the rest.

36
00:05:51,924 --> 00:05:54,741
- Will you be okay
on your own? - Yeah.

37
00:07:20,724 --> 00:07:22,237
Can I?

38
00:07:25,884 --> 00:07:28,921
I told you i don't want you
sleeping in Tobe's room.

39
00:07:29,021 --> 00:07:30,517
Can't you just...

40
00:07:31,544 --> 00:07:35,160
sleep in your own room
with the light on?

41
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:37,208
I thought I saw someone
outside my window.

42
00:07:38,189 --> 00:07:41,111
Well, if there really is
someone outside your window,

43
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:42,861
then come and get me.

44
00:07:43,668 --> 00:07:45,302
You told me not to bother you.

45
00:07:45,402 --> 00:07:47,556
Well, don't if it's
just a shadow.

46
00:07:51,964 --> 00:07:55,115
- I'll be right there!
<i>- You're a knockout!</i>

47
00:07:55,379 --> 00:07:57,998
- You're going to school like that?
- It's spring break.

48
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:02,090
All you kids ever get is breaks,

49
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:04,104
no wonder you have
no idea about anything.

50
00:08:04,204 --> 00:08:06,559
- Where are you going?
- To the beach.

51
00:08:08,204 --> 00:08:09,956
Hold on!

52
00:08:12,164 --> 00:08:15,282
- What?
- Don't stay out so late again.

53
00:08:15,847 --> 00:08:17,279
Okay.

54
00:08:17,884 --> 00:08:20,034
Put a shirt on!

55
00:08:24,878 --> 00:08:27,560
She's 18, who gets
fake tits at 18?

56
00:08:28,992 --> 00:08:33,275
- That's fucking disgusting.
- No, I think she looks better.

57
00:08:33,994 --> 00:08:37,057
- She feels better too. - Right,
all the guys looking at her now.

58
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:39,984
I say she's such a bitch.

59
00:08:40,084 --> 00:08:42,040
Yeah, she's a skank!

60
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:57,677
Does he work here?

61
00:09:08,644 --> 00:09:11,442
- Oh, my God, what a weirdo!

62
00:09:11,684 --> 00:09:13,037
Be quiet!

63
00:09:13,924 --> 00:09:15,624
- Howdy.
- Howdy!

64
00:09:15,724 --> 00:09:17,237
What can I do for you'll?

65
00:09:18,084 --> 00:09:20,154
You can fill it up
with unleaded, Tex.

66
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,174
Will do.

67
00:09:22,924 --> 00:09:25,882
- He said "howdy"...
- Oh my gosh, he's pathetic.

68
00:09:26,324 --> 00:09:28,280
Knock it off, Jeremy.

69
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,157
Tex, can you check the oil?

70
00:09:43,644 --> 00:09:46,158
Yeah, I'm gonna
do your windows too.

71
00:09:51,139 --> 00:09:53,434
Great, a real cowboy.

72
00:09:53,534 --> 00:09:57,643
We promise you guys full service,
so we got to give full service.

73
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:01,559
- Are you for real?
- What?

74
00:10:01,659 --> 00:10:03,954
Are you for real?

75
00:10:04,611 --> 00:10:06,282
I think so.

76
00:10:06,382 --> 00:10:08,123
Wanna get a squeeze?

77
00:10:09,444 --> 00:10:10,797
Yeah!

78
00:10:11,524 --> 00:10:13,082
He's real!

79
00:10:18,324 --> 00:10:20,997
- Can you believe it!
- In the flesh...

80
00:10:21,284 --> 00:10:23,673
- You touched the cowboy.
- How cool!

81
00:10:23,773 --> 00:10:25,283
How's the oil?

82
00:10:29,942 --> 00:10:31,642
All right.

83
00:10:31,742 --> 00:10:33,842
The belt's a bit ragged up.

84
00:10:33,942 --> 00:10:35,800
How far you are going?

85
00:10:36,694 --> 00:10:39,891
- Just going to the beach.
- Really?

86
00:10:40,462 --> 00:10:42,453
That's nice, I've never
been to the beach.

87
00:10:42,553 --> 00:10:44,261
How long have you lived here?

88
00:10:46,102 --> 00:10:48,252
Not too long.

89
00:10:48,542 --> 00:10:51,420
You can drive there
in like less than an hour.

90
00:10:52,142 --> 00:10:54,133
I can't, I don't have a car.

91
00:10:55,342 --> 00:10:56,855
How come?

92
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:59,457
How come I don't have a car?

93
00:11:01,502 --> 00:11:03,279
I don't like 'em...

94
00:11:03,742 --> 00:11:05,300
they make you lazy.

95
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:13,258
Pretty funny place to work
if you don't like cars.

96
00:11:14,104 --> 00:11:17,062
Ain't that the truth,
you gotta make a living.

97
00:11:18,024 --> 00:11:20,324
So what about this fanbelt?

98
00:11:20,424 --> 00:11:22,176
It should get you there.

99
00:11:26,504 --> 00:11:28,062
Have a good time.

100
00:11:34,304 --> 00:11:35,259
Hey...

101
00:11:39,624 --> 00:11:41,559
Do you wanna come?

102
00:11:43,504 --> 00:11:45,398
With you to the beach?

103
00:11:50,904 --> 00:11:52,576
Kind of.

104
00:11:54,121 --> 00:11:56,055
You actually got to work, so...

105
00:12:00,339 --> 00:12:02,495
You know what,
let me see about that.

106
00:12:02,595 --> 00:12:04,177
Hold on.

107
00:12:05,704 --> 00:12:07,456
Can we go?

108
00:12:08,401 --> 00:12:10,660
I invited Tex to the beach.

109
00:12:12,304 --> 00:12:14,454
- I can't believe it!
- Are you nuts?

110
00:12:14,704 --> 00:12:17,662
- What are you thinking?
- Maybe he's a psychopath.

111
00:12:18,984 --> 00:12:22,897
- Is he coming or not?
- I'm waiting for my change still.

112
00:12:24,224 --> 00:12:25,737
Get lost!

113
00:12:32,264 --> 00:12:34,016
Is that offer for real?

114
00:12:34,703 --> 00:12:36,337
Yeah.

115
00:12:37,264 --> 00:12:39,095
Did you get off work?

116
00:12:39,458 --> 00:12:42,297
- Sort of...
- Sort of?

117
00:12:42,397 --> 00:12:45,297
He said I could go,
but if I go, don't come back.

118
00:12:47,262 --> 00:12:49,017
Why would you wanna do that?

119
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:52,340
I wanna see the beach with you.

120
00:12:56,947 --> 00:12:58,502
Ok.

121
00:12:58,602 --> 00:13:00,302
Come on, then.

122
00:13:06,544 --> 00:13:09,695
- So, what's your name?
- Harlan.

123
00:13:09,987 --> 00:13:11,564
Just Harlan?

124
00:13:11,664 --> 00:13:14,815
My full name is Harlan
Fairfax Carruthers...

125
00:13:14,915 --> 00:13:16,816
That's definitely full...

126
00:13:17,504 --> 00:13:19,938
- What's your name?
- Tobe.

127
00:13:20,038 --> 00:13:22,573
Tobe short for, what, Toby?

128
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:25,697
Tabitha?

129
00:13:25,797 --> 00:13:27,457
Tobias?

130
00:13:28,452 --> 00:13:29,937
Manitoba?

131
00:13:31,104 --> 00:13:32,617
October.

132
00:13:33,384 --> 00:13:35,136
October, really?

133
00:13:35,543 --> 00:13:37,057
It's pretty.

134
00:13:38,499 --> 00:13:41,702
- It's nice to meet you all.
- Likewise, do you smoke?

135
00:13:42,048 --> 00:13:44,011
Is that weed?

136
00:13:45,961 --> 00:13:47,935
I don't touch
any of that stuff.

137
00:13:48,035 --> 00:13:49,856
Where are you from?

138
00:13:49,956 --> 00:13:52,334
- South Dakota.
- Really?

139
00:13:52,434 --> 00:13:54,313
I knew some dudes
from South Dakota,

140
00:13:54,413 --> 00:13:56,517
but they weren't
anything like you!

141
00:13:57,104 --> 00:13:58,662
That's okay too.

142
00:14:05,522 --> 00:14:07,136
Tell you what. When I woke up

143
00:14:07,236 --> 00:14:09,773
this morning I didn't think I would
end up looking at the ocean.

144
00:14:11,704 --> 00:14:13,376
Wanna go in?

145
00:14:14,104 --> 00:14:16,254
- In there?
- Yes.

146
00:14:17,338 --> 00:14:20,142
I like looking at it,
I ain't planning on drowning.

147
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,576
I'll protect you.

148
00:14:23,823 --> 00:14:26,586
I don't got the right clothes
for an ocean swim.

149
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:29,375
Just go in your underwear,

150
00:14:29,624 --> 00:14:31,535
like the Mexicans do.

151
00:14:33,184 --> 00:14:34,856
I don't know about that.

152
00:14:35,144 --> 00:14:37,220
Then just go in your pants.

153
00:14:40,584 --> 00:14:42,859
These jeans could
use a wash, you know.

154
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,423
C'mon.

155
00:14:46,064 --> 00:14:49,613
- You sure about this?
- Yeah, it'll be fun, I promise.

156
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:58,060
Gimme your hand.

157
00:15:05,624 --> 00:15:07,057
Here it comes!

158
00:15:23,261 --> 00:15:25,135
Are we too far out?

159
00:15:25,826 --> 00:15:27,582
You okay?

160
00:15:28,004 --> 00:15:30,254
We ain't gonna drift
out to sea, are we?

161
00:15:31,304 --> 00:15:33,977
Don't worry, I won't
let you drown.

162
00:15:35,104 --> 00:15:38,028
It's about as close to
forever as I could imagine.

163
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,935
Don't look out there,

164
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:45,175
just look at me.

165
00:17:29,503 --> 00:17:31,136
Holy smoke.

166
00:17:33,584 --> 00:17:34,983
See?

167
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:37,496
Should have gone
to the beach sooner?

168
00:17:56,681 --> 00:17:58,496
What time is it?

169
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:03,060
Dunno, it's late.

170
00:18:04,169 --> 00:18:06,175
It's early almost.

171
00:18:10,304 --> 00:18:12,135
I'd better go.

172
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,975
My dad is gonna kill me.

173
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,822
Well i hope not,
then I couldn't take you out.

174
00:18:23,239 --> 00:18:25,375
You wanna take me out?

175
00:18:25,881 --> 00:18:28,174
Yes, sure I mean,
this was fine,

176
00:18:29,904 --> 00:18:32,862
but this isn't
the proper way to meet.

177
00:18:35,264 --> 00:18:37,175
You're so funny.

178
00:19:14,561 --> 00:19:16,455
Hey, how do you do?

179
00:19:17,142 --> 00:19:19,100
I'm Harlan, what's your name?

180
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,572
Lonnie.

181
00:19:21,024 --> 00:19:22,582
Glad to meet you.

182
00:19:25,304 --> 00:19:28,057
Hell, I didn't
mess that up, did I?

183
00:19:28,704 --> 00:19:31,264
No, you just
got to crank it up.

184
00:19:32,104 --> 00:19:33,524
Oh, yeah.

185
00:19:33,624 --> 00:19:35,182
Look at that.

186
00:19:35,504 --> 00:19:37,654
That's classic, isn't it?

187
00:19:38,224 --> 00:19:40,784
I never seen one of
those that work.

188
00:19:40,884 --> 00:19:44,380
- Are you my dad's friend?
- Huh? No...

189
00:19:45,504 --> 00:19:47,654
I'm here to take your sister...

190
00:19:48,624 --> 00:19:50,278
Go out.

191
00:19:50,984 --> 00:19:52,895
We're going downtown.

192
00:19:55,104 --> 00:19:56,662
Is that all right with you?

193
00:19:58,984 --> 00:19:59,939
Yes.

194
00:20:00,904 --> 00:20:02,417
Okay.

195
00:20:05,024 --> 00:20:07,283
You're Tobe's
little brother, yeah?

196
00:20:08,104 --> 00:20:11,255
- What are you like, 11 or 12?
- 13.

197
00:20:11,824 --> 00:20:13,177
Are you 13, really?

198
00:20:13,904 --> 00:20:15,257
Sorry...

199
00:20:18,341 --> 00:20:20,619
- I'll get bigger.
- Yeah!

200
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,377
I don't mean...

201
00:20:23,064 --> 00:20:24,417
Yeah.

202
00:20:25,024 --> 00:20:27,284
I was smaller than you,
when I was your age.

203
00:20:27,384 --> 00:20:29,629
I had an uncle who said
I was like a tree twig,

204
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,014
said I was gonna get
blown away in a strong wind.

205
00:20:32,464 --> 00:20:34,022
I was real small!

206
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,815
Till I grew up.

207
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:41,297
- Where's Tobe?
- She's getting...

208
00:20:42,104 --> 00:20:43,495
How do I look?

209
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,817
Oh, man!

210
00:20:46,187 --> 00:20:47,583
Look at you!

211
00:20:49,464 --> 00:20:51,694
- It fits you out.
- It's perfect.

212
00:20:52,144 --> 00:20:54,374
- Do i look pretty in it?
- Yes.

213
00:20:54,701 --> 00:20:56,262
You're so pretty.

214
00:20:59,864 --> 00:21:03,140
You wanna get a bite to eat?

215
00:21:03,457 --> 00:21:06,496
We'll take your little brother,
before we go dancing.

216
00:21:07,104 --> 00:21:10,225
Hey, wanna go get a burger
with us, or something?

217
00:21:12,904 --> 00:21:14,324
All right,

218
00:21:14,424 --> 00:21:15,982
let's do it!

219
00:21:18,826 --> 00:21:20,462
Hey, dad.

220
00:21:20,562 --> 00:21:22,052
Hey.

221
00:21:23,904 --> 00:21:27,260
- This is Harlan.
- Nice to meet you, sir.

222
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:29,337
Wade.

223
00:21:33,824 --> 00:21:37,419
- Where'd you get that dress?
- Harlan got it for me.

224
00:21:40,744 --> 00:21:42,444
- What?
- It's nothing.

225
00:21:42,544 --> 00:21:46,298
I haven't seen you in a dress
since you were 13.

226
00:21:46,398 --> 00:21:48,819
That's a shame isn't it, a girl
as  beautiful as your daughter.

227
00:21:50,024 --> 00:21:51,377
What's your line, Harlan?

228
00:21:53,544 --> 00:21:54,693
I...

229
00:21:56,264 --> 00:21:58,604
I'm in the middle of figuring
that out right now.

230
00:21:58,704 --> 00:22:00,110
But i have a background
in ranching.

231
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:01,764
Not much ranching around here.

232
00:22:01,864 --> 00:22:04,070
Not that much anymore, but
anyway you would be surprised

233
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,619
how those skills apply
on a lot of other areas.

234
00:22:06,719 --> 00:22:08,536
You're right, I would be.

235
00:22:08,636 --> 00:22:12,538
We're gonna go take Lonnie out for
a burger, then we're gonna go out.

236
00:22:12,638 --> 00:22:14,462
As long as that's
okay with you, sir.

237
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:19,057
I guess.

238
00:22:20,904 --> 00:22:22,257
Well?

239
00:22:23,137 --> 00:22:26,620
Sir, I wanna tell you I got
real admiration for your daughter.

240
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,695
She's got a great spirit...

241
00:22:30,464 --> 00:22:32,819
I hope to earn your trust.

242
00:22:34,264 --> 00:22:35,617
Let's go.

243
00:22:40,544 --> 00:22:42,216
Who is that guy?

244
00:22:42,316 --> 00:22:44,964
- I met him at the beach.
- You met him at the beach?

245
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:47,624
- I gotta go.
- No, hold on.

246
00:22:50,984 --> 00:22:53,942
- You worked on a ranch?
- Yeah, sure did.

247
00:22:54,704 --> 00:22:55,932
Where?

248
00:22:56,504 --> 00:22:58,256
In South Dakota?

249
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:01,062
Yeah, back there a little.

250
00:23:01,664 --> 00:23:03,416
Out here more.

251
00:23:04,904 --> 00:23:07,054
There are still
ranches out here?

252
00:23:07,154 --> 00:23:08,817
They got a few.

253
00:23:09,464 --> 00:23:12,615
Most of them were cut out
or sold off, but...

254
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:15,374
- You like animals?
- Yes.

255
00:23:15,474 --> 00:23:16,898
Yeah?

256
00:23:19,984 --> 00:23:21,726
Well, if you're interested...

257
00:23:21,826 --> 00:23:24,883
we can go and check out one of
these big farms in the North Valley.

258
00:23:24,983 --> 00:23:27,364
I don't mean one of
those tourist traps,

259
00:23:27,464 --> 00:23:30,264
I mean a real working place,
what do you say?

260
00:23:30,647 --> 00:23:32,023
Yes.

261
00:23:36,624 --> 00:23:39,184
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

262
00:23:40,066 --> 00:23:41,742
Is that kid okay?

263
00:23:41,842 --> 00:23:43,940
- Who, Lonnie?
- Yes.

264
00:23:44,264 --> 00:23:46,016
Yes, why?

265
00:23:46,116 --> 00:23:48,220
Dunno, he seems kinda...

266
00:23:50,624 --> 00:23:53,058
I dunno, like he needs
some fresh air, or...

267
00:23:53,158 --> 00:23:54,902
like he needs...

268
00:23:55,807 --> 00:23:57,223
something.

269
00:23:58,064 --> 00:24:00,764
He's still really
scared of the dark.

270
00:24:00,864 --> 00:24:02,820
He has to sleep
with the light on.

271
00:24:03,864 --> 00:24:06,014
I could barely sleep
with the lights off!

272
00:24:07,304 --> 00:24:08,657
Anyway...

273
00:24:08,757 --> 00:24:10,462
he's okay.

274
00:24:10,742 --> 00:24:12,536
Plus, I look after him.

275
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:16,660
You're a good girl.

276
00:24:17,744 --> 00:24:19,496
I mean it.

277
00:24:19,784 --> 00:24:21,740
You have a good heart.

278
00:25:28,504 --> 00:25:29,857
April!

279
00:25:29,957 --> 00:25:31,856
Look who's here!

280
00:25:32,704 --> 00:25:35,696
I wanna do this with you,
it'll make us happy.

281
00:25:35,796 --> 00:25:37,900
I'm already happy with you.

282
00:25:39,264 --> 00:25:41,095
Not like this.

283
00:26:17,464 --> 00:26:18,817
Let's go!

284
00:26:20,864 --> 00:26:22,820
Hold on, be right there.

285
00:26:28,024 --> 00:26:29,173
Hey, man.

286
00:26:29,273 --> 00:26:31,460
Window's open, what
are you all doing?

287
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,404
Where's the cowboy?

288
00:26:33,504 --> 00:26:36,462
What are you doing,
John Wayne? C'mon!

289
00:26:36,904 --> 00:26:39,382
You gotta love people, not cars.

290
00:26:39,482 --> 00:26:40,898
I'm serious!

291
00:26:40,998 --> 00:26:42,822
What are you doin'?

292
00:26:42,922 --> 00:26:46,211
You don't belong in there,
you belong out here.

293
00:26:46,311 --> 00:26:49,058
We'got places to go.

294
00:26:49,158 --> 00:26:50,703
Look!

295
00:26:50,803 --> 00:26:53,299
- Everyone out!
- The hell with cars!

296
00:26:53,399 --> 00:26:55,899
- Hug me!
- No, you do it.

297
00:26:57,144 --> 00:26:59,897
- Preach it, Texan!
- Yeah, I'll preach!

298
00:27:00,144 --> 00:27:02,260
Preach it, brother.

299
00:27:02,504 --> 00:27:04,176
See, I'm preaching!

300
00:27:04,276 --> 00:27:06,124
- Stop that.
- What?

301
00:27:06,224 --> 00:27:09,500
- Are you crazy?
- No, I'm the sanest of all.

302
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,244
- Yeah, right.
- It's true, look.

303
00:27:12,344 --> 00:27:14,699
They're sitting
in their boxes driving.

304
00:27:17,144 --> 00:27:20,102
Look how many boxes,
an endless line!

305
00:27:37,904 --> 00:27:40,054
How long does this last?

306
00:27:41,304 --> 00:27:43,215
For a while.

307
00:27:43,544 --> 00:27:45,500
You wont feel it tomorrow.

308
00:27:47,904 --> 00:27:49,576
What are you thinking?

309
00:27:50,024 --> 00:27:51,684
Dunno,

310
00:27:51,784 --> 00:27:54,537
there are lots of things
I'd wanna do, but...

311
00:27:54,904 --> 00:27:56,860
I'll never get to do them.

312
00:27:57,704 --> 00:27:59,854
You can do anything
you want to do.

313
00:28:01,904 --> 00:28:05,738
You can even be anybody
you wanna be if you just...

314
00:28:06,184 --> 00:28:07,936
Decide and...

315
00:28:08,584 --> 00:28:09,858
do it.

316
00:28:09,958 --> 00:28:12,937
It's like waiting
for life to start.

317
00:28:14,864 --> 00:28:17,378
A new start, you know?

318
00:28:17,704 --> 00:28:21,219
Most days I just wanna
step outside of my heart.

319
00:28:22,984 --> 00:28:25,942
Go walk under a sky
full of stars.

320
00:28:27,504 --> 00:28:30,462
And hear nothing but the wind.

321
00:28:30,784 --> 00:28:33,935
And when I do speak I want it
to be with my true voice.

322
00:28:34,035 --> 00:28:37,938
- Do you think you talk
with your real voice? - Dunno.

323
00:28:40,384 --> 00:28:42,044
How do I know it?

324
00:28:42,144 --> 00:28:46,296
Cause you don't hear other voices
in your head while talking.

325
00:28:47,624 --> 00:28:49,774
Till things you really
wanna be saying,

326
00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:53,782
you don't say things
that don't matter to you.

327
00:28:54,257 --> 00:28:57,217
Are you true with yourself?

328
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:01,216
Not very often.

329
00:29:03,664 --> 00:29:05,620
But I do right now.

330
00:29:09,464 --> 00:29:11,022
Me too.

331
00:29:18,144 --> 00:29:20,982
- Hi. - Where the fuck
have you been?

332
00:29:21,466 --> 00:29:23,301
I slept at April's.

333
00:29:23,824 --> 00:29:25,780
Wait a goddamn minute!

334
00:29:30,064 --> 00:29:31,622
What happened to the guy?

335
00:29:34,504 --> 00:29:37,257
I was up all night
worried sick about you.

336
00:29:37,357 --> 00:29:40,655
- I am sure your friend kept your
mind out of it? - Come here!

337
00:29:40,755 --> 00:29:43,657
- I'm not done talking.
- Leave me alone.

338
00:29:43,757 --> 00:29:45,417
Come out!

339
00:29:45,517 --> 00:29:48,324
- Open the door.
- No fucking way!

340
00:29:48,424 --> 00:29:50,221
Open the damn door.

341
00:29:52,093 --> 00:29:53,990
We're gonna talk
about this tonight,

342
00:29:54,090 --> 00:29:56,423
and you be here
when I get home.

343
00:29:56,664 --> 00:29:58,336
- Hear me?
- Yes.

344
00:29:58,436 --> 00:30:00,540
- What?
- Yes!

345
00:30:10,264 --> 00:30:12,352
You got something
in there that is mine,

346
00:30:12,452 --> 00:30:14,324
I ain't gonna give it up cheap!

347
00:30:14,424 --> 00:30:16,984
If I come in,
I'm coming in hot!

348
00:30:25,943 --> 00:30:28,403
You got some nerve
shooting at me.

349
00:30:29,104 --> 00:30:31,664
Half that is mine,
there's plenty for everyone!

350
00:30:31,764 --> 00:30:33,815
<i>Knock it off, will you!</i>

351
00:30:34,504 --> 00:30:36,654
Keep it down yourself!

352
00:30:37,059 --> 00:30:39,804
You think I like listening to
your game shows all day.

353
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:42,054
<i>You have something
wrong with you!</i>

354
00:30:44,062 --> 00:30:46,404
It's greed that it's gonna
be the death of you,

355
00:30:46,504 --> 00:30:48,017
'cause you...

356
00:30:49,664 --> 00:30:51,164
You are greedy little pig,

357
00:30:51,264 --> 00:30:54,813
and you'll squeal like a pig
when I come through that door!

358
00:30:55,684 --> 00:30:57,057
<i>Fuck.</i>

359
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:09,062
All over for a few lumps of ore.

360
00:31:15,064 --> 00:31:18,022
I guess this is just
the human falling.

361
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,742
Almost there.

362
00:31:39,264 --> 00:31:41,824
- These the ones?
- Them all right.

363
00:31:42,744 --> 00:31:44,302
You like 'em?

364
00:31:45,624 --> 00:31:47,164
Well...

365
00:31:47,264 --> 00:31:48,892
which one you want.

366
00:31:52,664 --> 00:31:54,143
Hey, there.

367
00:31:56,624 --> 00:31:58,117
Good boy.

368
00:32:02,704 --> 00:32:04,262
Come on.

369
00:32:33,464 --> 00:32:35,136
What do you think?

370
00:32:36,264 --> 00:32:37,856
It's beautiful.

371
00:32:38,264 --> 00:32:40,175
Yeah, it still is.

372
00:33:05,424 --> 00:33:07,804
Do you think things
have a purpose?

373
00:33:08,733 --> 00:33:10,831
What do you mean?

374
00:33:12,464 --> 00:33:16,298
Do you think everything's has
something it's supposed to do

375
00:33:17,104 --> 00:33:18,856
or be?

376
00:33:19,504 --> 00:33:21,460
Kind of a nice thought.

377
00:33:21,904 --> 00:33:23,462
I sat here a lot of times.

378
00:33:23,784 --> 00:33:25,740
I looked at this tree and

379
00:33:26,122 --> 00:33:28,300
i wondered if that
branch had a purpose.

380
00:33:30,024 --> 00:33:31,696
Maybe it's here...

381
00:33:32,624 --> 00:33:34,740
to provide shade.

382
00:33:35,464 --> 00:33:37,102
Or maybe...

383
00:33:37,202 --> 00:33:40,893
it'll get cut down to make somebody
a nice piece of furniture someday.

384
00:33:42,281 --> 00:33:44,660
Maybe it's supposed to
have a swing on it.

385
00:33:47,704 --> 00:33:51,856
Maybe it's just here so
the tree can balance itself.

386
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:55,414
I'd lean towards the swing.

387
00:33:55,514 --> 00:33:57,620
It seems like hopeful to me.

388
00:34:00,504 --> 00:34:03,496
And now i see sitting up there,
I know I'm right.

389
00:34:38,224 --> 00:34:40,180
Can I watch?

390
00:34:42,944 --> 00:34:44,218
Yeah.

391
00:34:49,584 --> 00:34:51,415
Where's your sister?

392
00:34:51,515 --> 00:34:53,222
Dunno.

393
00:34:54,224 --> 00:34:56,579
Are you still mad at her?

394
00:34:58,224 --> 00:35:00,579
Look, I love
your sister, she just...

395
00:35:01,624 --> 00:35:04,124
She gets under my
skin sometimes, okay?

396
00:35:06,624 --> 00:35:08,296
What do you love about her?

397
00:35:08,647 --> 00:35:10,523
I don't know,
she's got gumption.

398
00:35:10,623 --> 00:35:12,055
What's that?

399
00:35:12,683 --> 00:35:14,176
It means...

400
00:35:15,383 --> 00:35:18,739
she has spirit,
she won't take shit.

401
00:35:20,823 --> 00:35:23,744
This drives me crazy but I
know it's good for her.

402
00:35:23,844 --> 00:35:25,979
America's tough on the meek.

403
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:28,179
But they'll inherit the earth.

404
00:35:28,279 --> 00:35:31,031
- What?
- They'll inherit the earth.

405
00:35:34,743 --> 00:35:36,620
Where did you get that crap.

406
00:35:37,263 --> 00:35:39,219
I heard it on TV.

407
00:35:40,322 --> 00:35:43,203
The meek may inherit fortune
from relatives that dies,

408
00:35:43,303 --> 00:35:44,975
but not the earth.

409
00:35:45,503 --> 00:35:48,325
The only good thing about
the meek is they make...

410
00:35:49,823 --> 00:35:52,576
life easier for those
with grumption.

411
00:35:53,823 --> 00:35:55,779
Can you learn grumption?

412
00:36:00,623 --> 00:36:03,376
No, you either
got it or you don't.

413
00:36:14,623 --> 00:36:15,817
Hold it!

414
00:36:20,396 --> 00:36:23,502
Hey, Charlie, you've
kept him in great shape.

415
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:26,542
We've been running all day.

416
00:36:30,084 --> 00:36:31,366
Get off him.

417
00:36:32,383 --> 00:36:35,480
- What?
- Get off my horse.

418
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,503
Get off the horse,
you speak English?

419
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:43,963
Quit fooling around, Charlie,
you're scaring my girl.

420
00:36:44,063 --> 00:36:47,976
You're on my property,
you're on my horse.

421
00:36:48,463 --> 00:36:52,629
If I shot you I would be
well within the law.

422
00:36:52,729 --> 00:36:56,135
- I ain't sure that's technically
correct. - Get off the horse.

423
00:36:56,235 --> 00:36:58,270
It's okay, sweetheart,
we're having some

424
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,363
kind of miscommunication,
we'll work it out.

425
00:37:00,463 --> 00:37:04,615
I don't know what's wrong with
your friend head there, mam,

426
00:37:04,715 --> 00:37:07,683
but you'd better talk him down
off that horse as fast as you can!

427
00:37:07,783 --> 00:37:09,218
Harlan, get down.

428
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,757
All right.

429
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,596
Not getting off cause
of you or your gun,

430
00:37:18,194 --> 00:37:21,780
but 'cause my girl here wants me
to, and I'd do anything for her.

431
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,378
Unlike you, Charlie, I got
my priorities straight.

432
00:37:24,478 --> 00:37:27,632
I don't give a rats ass
about your priorities.

433
00:37:27,732 --> 00:37:29,490
And stop calling me Charlie.

434
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,655
You know what, you
really dissapoint me.

435
00:37:41,755 --> 00:37:43,252
After all our nice
conversations we had,

436
00:37:43,352 --> 00:37:45,003
now you embarrass me
in front of my girl like this?

437
00:37:45,103 --> 00:37:46,932
I should kick your ass
just for that.

438
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:49,203
Come on, sweet pea,
let's get out of here.

439
00:37:49,303 --> 00:37:52,739
- You're not going anywhere.
- Put the rifle down!

440
00:37:54,263 --> 00:37:56,572
- Put the firearm down.
- They're the thieves.

441
00:37:56,672 --> 00:37:59,408
Thank you, officer. Have you
lost your mind, Charlie?

442
00:37:59,508 --> 00:38:01,695
- Pointing a gun
at your friends? - Easy.

443
00:38:01,795 --> 00:38:03,933
Them are the thieves.
These are the thieves.

444
00:38:04,033 --> 00:38:07,381
Sir, everybody,
what's going on her?

445
00:38:07,481 --> 00:38:09,739
- They stole my horse.
- We didn't steal anything.

446
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:11,621
The horse is rigt there!

447
00:38:11,721 --> 00:38:14,247
They came on my property,
and they stole a horse

448
00:38:14,347 --> 00:38:16,719
and that guy with the cowboy hat
just threatened me.

449
00:38:16,819 --> 00:38:18,251
What a bullshit?

450
00:38:18,351 --> 00:38:21,256
- Don't you start!
- Take it easy.

451
00:38:21,356 --> 00:38:23,573
- Where's the horse?
- There.

452
00:38:23,673 --> 00:38:26,969
The white one, was stolen
by them without my permission.

453
00:38:27,069 --> 00:38:28,905
- Off my property.
- Wait, officer!

454
00:38:29,005 --> 00:38:30,769
I borrow the horse all the time.

455
00:38:30,869 --> 00:38:33,323
Charlie says it's fine as long
as I bring my own gear.

456
00:38:33,423 --> 00:38:35,683
He wasn't here when we
happen to show up,

457
00:38:35,783 --> 00:38:38,264
so we borrowed the horse, we come
back and now he's flipped on me.

458
00:38:38,364 --> 00:38:39,843
You think this is the Old West?

459
00:38:39,943 --> 00:38:42,523
- This is the goddamn Valley.
- You're the one with the gun!

460
00:38:42,623 --> 00:38:44,667
I don't even know
the guy for Christ's sake.

461
00:38:44,767 --> 00:38:46,243
He takes a lot of medication,

462
00:38:46,343 --> 00:38:48,618
sometimes he get off it,
so he gets like this.

463
00:38:48,718 --> 00:38:52,351
- I don't take medication!
- You gotta take those pills.

464
00:38:52,451 --> 00:38:56,014
- My name isn't Charlie!
- Get them in the car right now.

465
00:39:01,522 --> 00:39:03,433
Have you really met Charlie?

466
00:39:04,002 --> 00:39:06,118
Of course, I told you I did.

467
00:39:07,602 --> 00:39:10,560
You can tell me,
it's all ok.

468
00:39:12,682 --> 00:39:15,932
He says his name
wasn't Charlie.

469
00:39:16,032 --> 00:39:20,241
That? I don't know if he has
another name or something,

470
00:39:20,482 --> 00:39:22,438
I've always called him Charlie.

471
00:39:26,682 --> 00:39:28,274
You mad at me?

472
00:39:31,642 --> 00:39:32,995
Shit!

473
00:39:33,482 --> 00:39:34,881
Great.

474
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:49,702
I take better care of critters,

475
00:39:49,802 --> 00:39:52,236
a whole lot better than you
take care of your children.

476
00:39:52,336 --> 00:39:53,902
Right.

477
00:39:54,002 --> 00:39:56,562
Tell me exactly what happened.

478
00:40:02,962 --> 00:40:05,112
Sir, I just want to say that...

479
00:40:06,482 --> 00:40:08,438
I understand
if you're upset but...

480
00:40:09,482 --> 00:40:11,996
Tobe had nothing to do with it.

481
00:40:13,082 --> 00:40:16,472
If there was any fault at all
it was definitely mine.

482
00:40:16,764 --> 00:40:18,758
You don't have to apologize.

483
00:40:18,858 --> 00:40:24,030
I think it's important to take
responsability for your actions.

484
00:40:24,482 --> 00:40:27,440
Nothing's more you can ask a
person than take responsability,

485
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:30,435
how about not breaking
the law with a minor?

486
00:40:32,301 --> 00:40:33,835
Well, yeah, sure.

487
00:40:35,602 --> 00:40:40,039
But that don't apply cause
that wasn't the case.

488
00:40:40,694 --> 00:40:42,838
It was a misunderstanding.

489
00:40:45,002 --> 00:40:47,152
Tobe, tell your friend here...

490
00:40:48,082 --> 00:40:51,358
It'll take a little bit more
honesty to win me over.

491
00:40:51,458 --> 00:40:54,435
- I don't give a shit if he
wins you over! - Hey!

492
00:41:14,617 --> 00:41:17,197
See you, Lonnie.
Thanks a lot.

493
00:41:52,442 --> 00:41:54,000
- Stop!
- Let me go!

494
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:56,167
You sit down and talk to me!

495
00:41:56,267 --> 00:41:58,809
I don't want to talk to you.

496
00:41:59,402 --> 00:42:01,393
- Let me go!
- Calm down!

497
00:42:02,642 --> 00:42:03,916
Fuck you!

498
00:42:04,776 --> 00:42:07,713
You want me to fuck off, I'm
your fucking goddamn father.

499
00:42:12,921 --> 00:42:14,514
I'm her fucking father.

500
00:42:14,614 --> 00:42:19,313
If I catch you near that nutcase,
I'll break his fucking ass!

501
00:42:32,661 --> 00:42:34,639
Wait, go back in.

502
00:42:34,739 --> 00:42:36,540
- Stop it, dammit!
- Let go!

503
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,876
Get the hell back in!

504
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:47,796
Tobe, I am sorry.

505
00:42:48,402 --> 00:42:51,360
- Get the fuck away from me.
- You all right?

506
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,957
Get the fuck away!

507
00:43:19,002 --> 00:43:22,358
- What are you doing?
- Knocking on your window.

508
00:43:22,458 --> 00:43:24,832
- What were you doing?
- Sleeping.

509
00:43:26,282 --> 00:43:28,796
How did your window get broke?

510
00:43:30,002 --> 00:43:32,357
It was just an accident.

511
00:43:33,082 --> 00:43:35,801
- Did he get
rough with you? - No.

512
00:43:35,901 --> 00:43:38,192
- You swear?
- Yes.

513
00:43:38,292 --> 00:43:40,313
Did he say anything about me?

514
00:43:43,882 --> 00:43:48,034
He just said he didn't want me
to see you anymore.

515
00:43:53,282 --> 00:43:57,833
- You're not gonna listen
to him, are you? - No way.

516
00:44:02,482 --> 00:44:04,757
Will you come
take a walk with me?

517
00:44:04,857 --> 00:44:06,594
I can't.

518
00:44:06,694 --> 00:44:09,515
There's a religious
parade down the road.

519
00:44:09,762 --> 00:44:13,721
Spanish Lutherans, you've
never seen spirit like that.

520
00:44:13,821 --> 00:44:16,152
I can't, just not tonight.

521
00:44:16,682 --> 00:44:19,116
- I'll see you tomorrow?
- I'm not gonna be here.

522
00:44:19,539 --> 00:44:21,617
I got to go with April
and her parents

523
00:44:21,717 --> 00:44:23,714
to San Diego for the week-end.

524
00:44:23,814 --> 00:44:27,159
- Can I see you Monday morning?
- Yes, but not here.

525
00:44:27,402 --> 00:44:29,677
'Cause of my dad...

526
00:44:29,777 --> 00:44:32,914
- I'll come to see you.
- Okay, what time?

527
00:44:33,802 --> 00:44:35,793
How about 10:02.

528
00:44:37,082 --> 00:44:41,314
- Why so late?
- 10:01?

529
00:44:42,682 --> 00:44:44,434
That'll do.

530
00:44:46,322 --> 00:44:48,233
Crazy cowboy!

531
00:44:50,802 --> 00:44:52,394
You love me?

532
00:44:54,042 --> 00:44:56,602
Yes, now go.

533
00:45:03,802 --> 00:45:05,360
Bye.

534
00:45:27,362 --> 00:45:28,942
<i>"Dear Joe,"</i>

535
00:45:29,042 --> 00:45:30,881
<i>"I am sorry to notice
how many days</i>

536
00:45:30,981 --> 00:45:33,797
<i>"have come and gone since
you have heard word from me.</i>

537
00:45:34,042 --> 00:45:35,678
<i>"Did you think
your old cowpoke</i>

538
00:45:35,778 --> 00:45:37,982
<i>"had rode himself
off the edge of the earth?</i>

539
00:45:38,082 --> 00:45:40,038
<i>"Gone, but not forgotten, I hope."</i>

540
00:45:44,318 --> 00:45:46,353
<i>"I've meant to write you
for some time,"</i>

541
00:45:46,453 --> 00:45:48,433
<i>"but it just been too darn busy,</i>

542
00:45:48,533 --> 00:45:50,976
<i>"well, what with working so
hard and trying to have fun</i>

543
00:45:51,076 --> 00:45:52,757
<i>"every now and then on the side.</i>

544
00:45:54,971 --> 00:45:58,742
<i>"I know you worry about me
being lonely out here on my own,</i>

545
00:45:58,842 --> 00:46:02,121
<i>"but you'll be pleased to know
I am going with a super gal,</i>

546
00:46:02,221 --> 00:46:04,081
<i>"her name is October.</i>

547
00:46:04,181 --> 00:46:07,641
<i>"Eight million folks in this
town, but she's the one for me.</i>

548
00:46:07,741 --> 00:46:10,920
<i>"She brought me to her family,
and they had made me their own,</i>

549
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:13,471
<i>"and we're stuck together
like each other's shadow."</i>

550
00:46:36,082 --> 00:46:38,232
Hey, it's the twig man.

551
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:40,915
- What's up, buddy?
- Nothing.

552
00:46:43,082 --> 00:46:45,038
- You having a good vacation?
- Yes.

553
00:46:46,482 --> 00:46:49,155
- Is Tobe around?
- No.

554
00:46:52,122 --> 00:46:55,876
- She's not back from her trip?
- Dunno.

555
00:46:59,202 --> 00:47:01,158
Wanna wait for her?

556
00:47:03,242 --> 00:47:05,995
I was waiting for her,
she was...

557
00:47:06,522 --> 00:47:08,274
supposed to come by but...

558
00:47:11,482 --> 00:47:13,200
I am gonna be at my spread,

559
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:15,862
when she gets home just tell
her to come and see me, okay?

560
00:47:15,962 --> 00:47:17,315
Okay.

561
00:47:17,415 --> 00:47:19,120
See you.

562
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:20,460
Hey, Harlan.

563
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:26,994
Wanna see something?

564
00:47:28,882 --> 00:47:29,951
Yeah.

565
00:47:31,282 --> 00:47:34,479
Wow, helluva collection!

566
00:47:37,461 --> 00:47:39,598
Know what this is?

567
00:47:40,116 --> 00:47:43,881
- A 1921 Colt Peacemaker.
- Yep, it's his favorite.

568
00:47:45,802 --> 00:47:47,474
That's a beauty!

569
00:47:49,602 --> 00:47:52,639
- Ever go shooting with him?
- No.

570
00:47:52,882 --> 00:47:56,431
- He says i have to be 16
to touch a gun. - 16?

571
00:47:59,002 --> 00:48:02,551
- Your dad was in the war, huh?
- I guess.

572
00:48:04,842 --> 00:48:06,195
Nice.

573
00:48:07,962 --> 00:48:09,873
Do you have anything today?

574
00:48:47,495 --> 00:48:50,840
So, who is your real father,
if it ain't Wade?

575
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:52,595
Dunno.

576
00:48:53,242 --> 00:48:57,201
- I never met him.
- So, Wade's it, huh?

577
00:48:58,795 --> 00:49:02,238
Yeah, he pays for
our food and everything.

578
00:49:02,338 --> 00:49:05,440
It takes more than that
to be a father.

579
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:07,434
Where's your dad?

580
00:49:08,682 --> 00:49:12,641
He left me and my mom
when I was your age.

581
00:49:22,442 --> 00:49:25,798
This right here, is
a single action Colt 45.

582
00:49:26,322 --> 00:49:29,439
They have been making
that gun since 1873.

583
00:49:29,539 --> 00:49:31,782
They haven't made
a single change to it,

584
00:49:31,882 --> 00:49:34,734
because that's the way it is.
Everyone you ever heard of:

585
00:49:34,834 --> 00:49:37,982
Wyatt Earp, Billy the Kid, all of
them they had a gun like this.

586
00:49:38,082 --> 00:49:40,232
Now, single action,

587
00:49:40,332 --> 00:49:42,832
what that means you can
pull that trigger all day

588
00:49:42,932 --> 00:49:44,435
and it doesn't do nothing.

589
00:49:44,535 --> 00:49:46,701
You have to thumb
that hammer back to fire.

590
00:49:46,801 --> 00:49:49,960
You have to do it every time,
that makes it a little tricky.

591
00:49:50,060 --> 00:49:52,285
That means in the
old days, the gunfighters

592
00:49:52,385 --> 00:49:54,593
they had to draw and cock
and shoot all in one motion.

593
00:49:59,358 --> 00:50:01,797
After a while,
you get used to it.

594
00:50:17,482 --> 00:50:19,632
You want the last two?

595
00:50:23,282 --> 00:50:25,034
Stand here.

596
00:50:25,282 --> 00:50:28,262
When you're ready,
just thumb it back,

597
00:50:28,362 --> 00:50:30,262
let it roll nice and easy.

598
00:50:30,362 --> 00:50:33,362
Be ready it's gonna kick
a little the first time.

599
00:50:37,282 --> 00:50:41,116
Don't even aim, point
as if it were your finger,

600
00:50:41,442 --> 00:50:43,797
as if it were an extension
of you, okay?

601
00:50:54,482 --> 00:50:55,881
Look at that!

602
00:50:56,842 --> 00:50:58,355
That's good stuff!

603
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:55,193
That's my favorite song.

604
00:51:57,082 --> 00:52:00,040
We can sound allright with
a little more practise.

605
00:52:00,140 --> 00:52:02,034
Tobe's not here.

606
00:52:02,282 --> 00:52:04,557
I don't want her
spending time with you.

607
00:52:04,657 --> 00:52:08,761
I'd have to hear that from her,
before it's okay with me.

608
00:52:11,457 --> 00:52:14,435
Anyway, I wasn't spending time
with Tobe, I was here with Lonnie.

609
00:52:14,535 --> 00:52:17,672
The point is, I don't
want you around here, period.

610
00:52:17,772 --> 00:52:19,852
I know the circumstances
of the other night,

611
00:52:19,952 --> 00:52:21,816
probably don't fit
too right with you.

612
00:52:21,916 --> 00:52:24,881
I'm sure you think
I am a bad influence.

613
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:26,914
But I ain't.

614
00:52:27,014 --> 00:52:29,312
I have nothing
but good intentions.

615
00:52:29,838 --> 00:52:32,317
I just wish you'd
accept my apology?

616
00:52:33,017 --> 00:52:36,204
You're the honcho, I wouldn't
try to take that from you.

617
00:52:36,304 --> 00:52:39,474
- Okay, it's Harlan right?
- Yes.

618
00:52:39,574 --> 00:52:41,713
Harlan Fairfax Carruthers.

619
00:52:41,813 --> 00:52:46,319
Okay, Harlan, I know you, and
I ain't buying what you're saying.

620
00:52:47,441 --> 00:52:49,400
How do you know
so much about me?

621
00:52:49,500 --> 00:52:51,997
It's my job,
I see your kind every day.

622
00:52:52,097 --> 00:52:54,073
- My kind?
- Yes.

623
00:52:54,173 --> 00:52:57,359
- My kind, what is that?
- Want me to spell it out for you?

624
00:52:57,459 --> 00:52:59,832
- I think you should.
- What you are?

625
00:52:59,932 --> 00:53:04,082
A piece of trailer trash, a nobody
who wishes he was a somebody.

626
00:53:04,182 --> 00:53:05,694
What makes you different,

627
00:53:05,794 --> 00:53:09,073
is you're willing to do something
stupid to reach your goal,

628
00:53:09,173 --> 00:53:10,880
that makes you a menace.

629
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:14,478
That's why I don't want
you around my kids.

630
00:53:14,877 --> 00:53:16,515
Really...

631
00:53:18,642 --> 00:53:21,475
- Tell me the truth, does
that sounds like me? - No.

632
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:28,844
- Shut up and go inside. - That
boy has a right to his opinion.

633
00:53:28,944 --> 00:53:31,477
- Go inside.
- He's my friend, he knows me!

634
00:53:31,722 --> 00:53:33,022
Go inside!
- It's ok!

635
00:53:33,122 --> 00:53:35,272
You shut the fuck up and
you go inside! - Hey, hey!

636
00:53:35,372 --> 00:53:37,462
- Hey, don't yell at him.
- Get the fuck inside!

637
00:53:37,562 --> 00:53:40,474
You better talk to me, mister,
cause I am here,

638
00:53:40,574 --> 00:53:42,756
I ain't a nobody, I'm a person.

639
00:53:42,856 --> 00:53:46,467
And I won't leave just 'cause
one son of a bitch don't like me.

640
00:53:46,567 --> 00:53:49,875
I know I'm not important, but
I know how to stand my ground.

641
00:53:49,975 --> 00:53:51,794
For love.

642
00:53:54,682 --> 00:53:56,354
Shit.

643
00:53:56,659 --> 00:53:59,116
I'm sorry, man.
Really sorry.

644
00:54:00,722 --> 00:54:02,553
You should go.

645
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,834
I can't.
I can't do that.

646
00:54:06,002 --> 00:54:07,560
No more. No more.

647
00:54:08,602 --> 00:54:12,002
He's getting his gun!
- That's okay...

648
00:54:12,102 --> 00:54:14,742
You don't got to go here.
We don't have to do this at all.

649
00:54:14,842 --> 00:54:16,262
Get the hell outta here.

650
00:54:16,362 --> 00:54:19,195
You're setting a bad example
for that boy. - Don't!

651
00:54:22,602 --> 00:54:24,752
Am I getting through to you?

652
00:54:28,482 --> 00:54:30,438
Yes, you are getting through.

653
00:54:31,642 --> 00:54:33,598
Getting through, loud and clear.

654
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:42,999
- You want a bullet or want me to
get out of here? - Get the fuck out.

655
00:54:49,482 --> 00:54:52,519
Okay, put it down,
I'll leave.

656
00:55:09,194 --> 00:55:12,758
You're a real solid kid, don't
let anybody tell you different.

657
00:55:23,693 --> 00:55:25,529
You can't threaten
my friends with a gun!

658
00:55:25,629 --> 00:55:27,361
What right do you have
to do that?

659
00:55:27,461 --> 00:55:29,262
How do I know if he's
some kind of a pervert?

660
00:55:29,362 --> 00:55:31,751
- You're a fucking bastard.
- Watch your fucking mouth!

661
00:55:31,851 --> 00:55:34,755
- Cause you're a fucking
one too. - Really!

662
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:39,595
Fuck you.

663
00:55:39,997 --> 00:55:42,802
- Let go!
- No, stop it!

664
00:55:43,042 --> 00:55:44,395
Stop it.

665
00:55:44,642 --> 00:55:47,315
Knock it off, I said enough!

666
00:55:48,082 --> 00:55:49,435
All right.

667
00:55:50,002 --> 00:55:51,754
I love him!

668
00:55:52,136 --> 00:55:54,436
Why can't you just
let me love him?

669
00:56:52,399 --> 00:56:53,791
Hi.

670
00:56:54,642 --> 00:56:56,917
Where you've been?
I was worried.

671
00:56:57,017 --> 00:56:59,073
Come sit down.

672
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:04,795
I'm okay.

673
00:57:07,242 --> 00:57:09,517
I'm sorry for
what he did to you.

674
00:57:13,842 --> 00:57:15,262
Yeah...

675
00:57:15,362 --> 00:57:16,920
It's all right.

676
00:57:17,802 --> 00:57:19,382
Sometimes...

677
00:57:19,482 --> 00:57:21,950
things like this makes it
whole lot clearer.

678
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:26,161
He said some bullshit,
like you tried to kidnap Lonnie!

679
00:57:27,417 --> 00:57:30,037
I didn't believe him,
he got so crazy.

680
00:57:30,137 --> 00:57:33,102
I brought Lonnie home before
the sun was even down.

681
00:57:33,202 --> 00:57:36,433
Want a donut or
some hot chocolate?

682
00:57:36,533 --> 00:57:38,081
Wait.

683
00:57:40,402 --> 00:57:42,962
Did you really take Lonnie out?

684
00:57:43,522 --> 00:57:45,451
Yeah, I came looking for you.

685
00:57:45,551 --> 00:57:47,640
I was worried when you
didn't show up.

686
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:50,840
He's there on his own,
he has nothing to do.

687
00:57:50,940 --> 00:57:53,662
I felt bad for him, so I
took him to the wash

688
00:57:53,762 --> 00:57:55,275
and popped a few cans.

689
00:57:55,682 --> 00:57:57,638
You took him shooting?

690
00:57:57,738 --> 00:57:59,355
Why would you do that?

691
00:57:59,682 --> 00:58:02,992
He was all alone, you should've
seen his face, I felt bad for him.

692
00:58:03,092 --> 00:58:06,791
That's not the point. You know
that would piss my dad off!

693
00:58:09,042 --> 00:58:10,236
Yeah...

694
00:58:13,402 --> 00:58:14,801
But...

695
00:58:15,373 --> 00:58:19,037
Look, I had him back
before he got home.

696
00:58:22,158 --> 00:58:24,796
You can't just do
things like that.

697
00:58:25,203 --> 00:58:28,798
Now it'll be even harder
for me to see you.

698
00:58:34,242 --> 00:58:35,641
October...

699
00:58:37,202 --> 00:58:39,511
Are you happy living in
that house with Wade?

700
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:46,274
I gotta get you out of there.

701
00:58:46,882 --> 00:58:48,076
What?

702
00:58:48,176 --> 00:58:50,422
I gotta get you out of there,
you and Lonnie both.

703
00:58:50,522 --> 00:58:53,673
- I'll take you somewhere else.
- Just stop being so...

704
00:58:53,773 --> 00:58:55,913
- Well, how the...
- Just be cool, okay?!

705
00:58:59,642 --> 00:59:01,394
I am cool as it could be.

706
00:59:07,642 --> 00:59:08,916
Look...

707
00:59:10,602 --> 00:59:12,877
let's just not see
each other for a while.

708
00:59:13,322 --> 00:59:16,280
- No! I don't wanna do that!
- Until things cool off.

709
00:59:16,380 --> 00:59:19,832
- How long will that take?
- I don't know.

710
00:59:24,476 --> 00:59:26,791
Where are you going? Don't go!

711
00:59:29,761 --> 00:59:31,672
I have to go home.

712
00:59:34,301 --> 00:59:35,901
Look...

713
00:59:36,001 --> 00:59:38,754
Everything will be fine, okay?

714
00:59:41,321 --> 00:59:44,074
I'll figure something out,
I promise.

715
01:00:18,761 --> 01:00:21,719
What's your line?

716
01:00:24,172 --> 01:00:27,040
I have a background in...

717
01:00:29,987 --> 01:00:34,743
automotive service and
I'm a fucking cowboy.

718
01:00:34,843 --> 01:00:36,618
What's your line?

719
01:00:37,761 --> 01:00:39,836
Fuck, why ranches.

720
01:00:51,761 --> 01:00:54,116
For real, I'm an Indian.

721
01:00:55,881 --> 01:00:57,633
Yes, an Indian.

722
01:00:58,361 --> 01:01:00,317
The last of the Mohicans.

723
01:01:03,441 --> 01:01:05,193
Why, what's your line?

724
01:01:07,641 --> 01:01:09,393
What's your line...

725
01:01:10,921 --> 01:01:12,513
Wade?

726
01:01:14,121 --> 01:01:15,679
Corrections?

727
01:01:16,561 --> 01:01:18,517
So you're a screwhead?

728
01:01:19,721 --> 01:01:22,872
Yeah, screwhead,
that's what we called you.

729
01:01:24,521 --> 01:01:26,876
Oh, you come from
a long line of screwheads?

730
01:01:28,182 --> 01:01:29,959
I'm from a long line of...

731
01:01:30,721 --> 01:01:33,779
warrior... kings.

732
01:01:34,191 --> 01:01:35,845
You think I am fooling?

733
01:01:37,984 --> 01:01:41,292
See that? That's how it's
gonna look coming at you.

734
01:02:21,552 --> 01:02:23,702
Yeah, who's a nobody now?

735
01:02:32,512 --> 01:02:34,423
I am coming in Harlan?

736
01:02:34,970 --> 01:02:36,825
Harlan, you in here?

737
01:02:39,272 --> 01:02:40,367
What'up, Rene?

738
01:02:40,467 --> 01:02:43,982
Just tell me that's not
a bullet hole in my window.

739
01:02:45,599 --> 01:02:48,463
- Why, I guess it is.
- Have you lost your fucking mind?

740
01:02:48,563 --> 01:02:51,951
- You don't shoot windows
out here! - Go to your room.

741
01:02:52,051 --> 01:02:55,588
- Why does he have a gun anyway?
- Go to your room!

742
01:02:57,478 --> 01:03:01,238
- Are you fucking crazy?
- I'm sorry, it was an accident.

743
01:03:01,338 --> 01:03:03,630
I don't care what it was.

744
01:03:03,878 --> 01:03:05,858
Harlan, you know I like you,

745
01:03:05,958 --> 01:03:09,338
but you never give me any
respect, so you gotta go.

746
01:03:09,438 --> 01:03:12,698
Don't think about it, don't
ponder in that brain of yours,

747
01:03:12,798 --> 01:03:14,891
just pack your stuff and go!

748
01:03:24,198 --> 01:03:25,943
I'm serious, Harlan.

749
01:03:26,043 --> 01:03:28,555
I'm getting my fucking
shit, Rene, all right?!

750
01:04:02,056 --> 01:04:03,569
Last stop.

751
01:04:50,327 --> 01:04:52,238
<i>"Dear Joe."</i>

752
01:04:53,247 --> 01:04:55,203
<i>"Isn't it funny how life goes?</i>

753
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:02,626
<i>"We all struggle so mildly,</i>

754
01:05:02,870 --> 01:05:06,419
<i>"I don't even think we know
what secret we're looking for.</i>

755
01:05:11,072 --> 01:05:13,857
<i>"People will tell you
all kinds of things out here</i>

756
01:05:13,957 --> 01:05:16,157
<i>"designed to
make you feel better.</i>

757
01:05:18,227 --> 01:05:21,027
<i>"I've never heard so many
hacks to remedies.</i>

758
01:05:25,626 --> 01:05:28,345
<i>"I've tried living down
in the Valley again.</i>

759
01:05:28,587 --> 01:05:30,737
<i>"Really tried this time.</i>

760
01:05:31,289 --> 01:05:34,324
<i>"I walked up and down it
looking for one open face,</i>

761
01:05:34,424 --> 01:05:35,957
<i>"but most people I've met</i>

762
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:38,857
<i>"hardly seems like human
beings to me anymore.</i>

763
01:05:47,827 --> 01:05:52,378
<i>"I often felt something mysterious
was keeping itself hidden from me.</i>

764
01:05:52,627 --> 01:05:55,585
<i>"I spent years trying
to guess at it.</i>

765
01:05:55,827 --> 01:05:59,327
<i>"Now life has revealed my
purpose to me all at once.</i>

766
01:05:59,427 --> 01:06:02,600
<i>"Everything else just
seems like an illusion,</i>

767
01:06:02,700 --> 01:06:04,324
<i>"like a painted wooden horse."</i>

768
01:06:39,535 --> 01:06:43,194
- Can I help you? - Maybe.
I'm looking for someone.

769
01:06:43,294 --> 01:06:44,727
Who are you looking for?

770
01:06:45,208 --> 01:06:46,963
A friend of mine.

771
01:06:47,548 --> 01:06:50,234
You're disturbing prayers,
you must leave.

772
01:06:50,334 --> 01:06:52,154
Okay, but...

773
01:06:52,254 --> 01:06:54,427
Leave, you're
disturbing our prayers.

774
01:06:54,527 --> 01:06:56,930
Okay, get your hands off.

775
01:06:57,454 --> 01:07:00,412
Don't push me, big fellow.
Hands off!

776
01:07:01,774 --> 01:07:04,447
Cut it out! Come on.

777
01:07:08,331 --> 01:07:10,886
Come on! Is this the way
you treat a person?

778
01:07:29,697 --> 01:07:31,608
<i>"It's been a long time, Joe."</i>

779
01:07:32,057 --> 01:07:35,208
<i>"You'd be surprised
to hear from me.</i>

780
01:07:35,308 --> 01:07:37,386
<i>"If we passed each other
on the street</i>

781
01:07:37,486 --> 01:07:40,008
<i>"we may not recognise
each other to say hello.</i>

782
01:07:40,337 --> 01:07:44,296
<i>"Maybe that's happened
without our even sensing it.</i>

783
01:07:47,097 --> 01:07:49,734
<i>"I used to wonder why
you did what you did,</i>

784
01:07:49,834 --> 01:07:51,597
<i>"what made you leave.</i>

785
01:07:51,697 --> 01:07:54,247
<i>"I think I see now, what
you're looking for.</i>

786
01:07:55,417 --> 01:07:59,401
<i>"I hope you see, that in my own
way, I'm after the same things.</i>

787
01:08:02,577 --> 01:08:04,430
<i>"I hope this letter
finds you well,</i>

788
01:08:04,530 --> 01:08:08,330
<i>"though I would've liked to look
at you in the face one more time.</i>

789

793
01:08:23,377 --> 01:08:27,529
<i>"wish me luck.
Your loving son.</i>

794
01:09:44,518 --> 01:09:46,295
Hi, sweetie.

795
01:09:52,355 --> 01:09:55,108
- What are you doing here?
- How are you?

796
01:09:56,235 --> 01:09:58,908
- Oh, gosh!
- Where have you been?

797
01:09:59,155 --> 01:10:01,669
Around, I didn't...

798
01:10:02,275 --> 01:10:04,835
I had a few things
I had to do.

799
01:10:05,530 --> 01:10:08,229
I was really worried about you,
didn't know where you were.

800
01:10:08,715 --> 01:10:12,867
I thought you didn't want
to see me for a while, so I...

801
01:10:13,572 --> 01:10:15,547
I thought I'd leave you alone.

802
01:10:15,834 --> 01:10:17,951
You didn't have to disappear.

803
01:10:18,657 --> 01:10:20,865
I was upset when
I said those things.

804
01:10:20,965 --> 01:10:24,664
You sure?
You're not mad at me now?

805
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,307
Oh, gosh.

806
01:10:28,915 --> 01:10:30,871
That's all that matters.

807
01:10:31,371 --> 01:10:33,386
Long as we're
sticking together.

808
01:10:34,333 --> 01:10:35,987
Are you okay?

809
01:10:36,715 --> 01:10:38,114
Yes, I...

810
01:10:38,730 --> 01:10:41,175
I know you wouldn't want
me coming around here

811
01:10:41,275 --> 01:10:45,188
I needed to see you,
talk to you about things.

812
01:10:46,267 --> 01:10:49,635
- How did you get in? - I thought
I heard you around the side.

813
01:10:49,735 --> 01:10:51,895
So i wandered around
and the door was open.

814
01:10:51,995 --> 01:10:56,361
I didn't see your dad's truck,
so I thought I could surprise you.

815
01:10:58,475 --> 01:11:01,308
- Let's go for a walk.
- No, come here.

816
01:11:01,408 --> 01:11:04,228
C'mon. No, no. C'mon.
We ain't got time.

817
01:11:17,315 --> 01:11:19,033
What's going on, Harlan?

818
01:11:21,075 --> 01:11:22,747
What do you mean?

819
01:11:23,515 --> 01:11:25,426
Why's my bag out?

820
01:11:25,526 --> 01:11:27,552
Because we're gonna
get out of here.

821
01:11:28,235 --> 01:11:29,907
What are you talking about?

822
01:11:30,444 --> 01:11:32,905
Like I said, I told you I'd
figure something out.

823
01:11:33,005 --> 01:11:34,924
I did, look, look.
It took me a little while,

824
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:37,024
but I got some
real dough together.

825
01:11:37,124 --> 01:11:40,392
This will take us a long way,
then we could get set up,

826
01:11:40,492 --> 01:11:44,469
take Lonnie in, or whatever
you wanna do, we can do it now.

827
01:11:44,715 --> 01:11:46,467
I packed a few things.

828
01:11:46,567 --> 01:11:48,342
Didn't know exactly
what you'd want,

829
01:11:48,442 --> 01:11:50,415
I was so excited I got
7 of everything.

830
01:11:50,875 --> 01:11:52,706
I didn't find 7 of your bras.

831
01:11:52,806 --> 01:11:55,055
But I put your dress in.

832
01:11:55,155 --> 01:11:57,467
I'm sure there's stuff
you're gonna want,

833
01:11:57,567 --> 01:11:59,307
little things
I don't know about.

834
01:12:00,595 --> 01:12:02,417
Sweetheart, what do you say?

835
01:12:02,517 --> 01:12:06,053
My dad will be here any second,
just go right now.

836
01:12:06,153 --> 01:12:08,629
No, no, no.
Wait, we got time.

837
01:12:08,729 --> 01:12:11,390
Get your stuff, we could
never get a chance.

838
01:12:11,490 --> 01:12:14,863
- Put this back, please.
- Wait, what are you doing?

839
01:12:14,963 --> 01:12:19,149
- My dad sees this he's
gonna kill me. - Wait, stop!

840
01:12:19,249 --> 01:12:22,095
We're gonna be a long way
away before he figures this out.

841
01:12:22,195 --> 01:12:25,495
I told you the other day that
I didn't want to go away!

842
01:12:30,109 --> 01:12:33,013
That wasn't you
talking, I know.

843
01:12:33,113 --> 01:12:34,439
Then who was it?

844
01:12:34,539 --> 01:12:36,735
That was someone else's
voice talking through you.

845
01:12:36,835 --> 01:12:38,024
That was your fear.

846
01:12:38,124 --> 01:12:40,080
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about,

847
01:12:40,180 --> 01:12:43,431
so I think you need to go.
- October, listen! Sweetheart.

848
01:12:43,708 --> 01:12:46,249
I know you're scared but we
ain't gonna get another chance.

849
01:12:46,349 --> 01:12:48,421
Look inside you and
listen to your true heart,

850
01:12:48,521 --> 01:12:50,175
listen to what is it telling you.

851
01:12:50,275 --> 01:12:51,723
You know what,
this is my true heart,

852
01:12:51,823 --> 01:12:53,615
this is my true voice,
I want you to go!

853
01:12:53,715 --> 01:12:56,452
- Don't holler at me!
- Well, you're not listening to me!

854
01:12:56,552 --> 01:12:59,388
You need to get out of her,
what's wrong with you?

855
01:12:59,488 --> 01:13:01,088
What's wrong with you!

856
01:13:25,414 --> 01:13:26,988
Sweetpea.

857
01:13:28,652 --> 01:13:30,587
Sweetpea, I didn't...

858
01:13:32,534 --> 01:13:34,286
Do you hear me, honey?

859
01:13:35,014 --> 01:13:36,766
Can you hear me?

860
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,166
Keep breathing.

861
01:13:40,266 --> 01:13:42,166
Keep breathing.

862
01:13:46,034 --> 01:13:47,447
Breathe.

863
01:13:56,217 --> 01:13:58,245
<i>911, what's your emergency?</i>

864
01:13:58,576 --> 01:14:00,644
<i>911, what is your emergency?</i>

865
01:14:26,374 --> 01:14:28,126
Anyone home?

866
01:14:29,934 --> 01:14:31,287
Tobe?

867
01:14:32,214 --> 01:14:33,567
Lonnie?

868
01:15:01,014 --> 01:15:02,925
Somebody help my daughter!

869
01:15:03,294 --> 01:15:05,649
Somebody help my daughter!

870
01:16:15,454 --> 01:16:17,604
Do you own other
firearms in the house?

871
01:16:17,704 --> 01:16:19,874
Yes, but I keep them all
under a lock and a key.

872
01:16:19,974 --> 01:16:21,487
'Cept for the one.

873
01:16:23,276 --> 01:16:25,034
He must to broken in to it.

874
01:16:25,938 --> 01:16:27,613
Case wasn't broken in into.

875
01:16:27,713 --> 01:16:29,933
Look, he got it somehow!

876
01:16:30,614 --> 01:16:32,889
Did she say anything?

877
01:16:32,989 --> 01:16:34,363
No.

878
01:16:35,814 --> 01:16:37,514
She was already...

879
01:16:37,614 --> 01:16:39,570
She was already
unconscious.

880
01:16:39,854 --> 01:16:42,004
- What about your son?
- No.

881
01:16:42,374 --> 01:16:44,285
Came home after we left.

882
01:16:44,385 --> 01:16:47,844
- Does he have access
to the guns? - No way!

883
01:16:48,814 --> 01:16:52,214
- His fingerprints were
on the gun. - What?

884
01:16:52,774 --> 01:16:56,528
- Could have been an accident.
- No, it wasn't an accident!

885
01:16:59,374 --> 01:17:03,731
Nobody's ever seen
that cowboy person, Wade.

886
01:17:21,134 --> 01:17:22,647
Hey, Twig!

887
01:17:28,436 --> 01:17:29,609
Hey, bud.

888
01:17:38,014 --> 01:17:40,369
Tobe got shot.

889
01:17:40,814 --> 01:17:42,566
Yeah, I know.

890
01:17:44,014 --> 01:17:46,448
- I had a hit too.
- Who did it?

891
01:17:47,294 --> 01:17:49,394
She didn't say
nothing to nobody.

892
01:17:49,494 --> 01:17:51,246
She's in a coma.

893
01:17:55,814 --> 01:17:58,089
It was Wade.

894
01:17:58,189 --> 01:18:00,689
- It was?
- Yes.

895
01:18:01,111 --> 01:18:04,079
I came to see her
and say goodbye.

896
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:07,055
I was going away,
for a while.

897
01:18:07,781 --> 01:18:10,044
She wanted to come with me.

898
01:18:11,454 --> 01:18:14,730
We were talking and
didn't hear him come home.

899
01:18:14,830 --> 01:18:19,172
He'd come at me with that gun, but
Tobe got in the way so he shot her.

900
01:18:19,272 --> 01:18:22,372
She was trying to protect me
and he shot her!

901
01:18:24,374 --> 01:18:27,525
What kind of a son of
a bitch would do that?

902
01:18:27,625 --> 01:18:30,527
He shot at me too, but I
jumped off the window.

903
01:18:30,627 --> 01:18:32,730
Where did you get shot?

904
01:18:36,014 --> 01:18:39,927
- Does it hurt? - No, it's
just went through the skin.

905
01:18:40,894 --> 01:18:42,646
I'm allright.

906
01:18:43,014 --> 01:18:45,767
My fingerprints were on the gun.

907
01:18:46,614 --> 01:18:49,765
I have to talk to the police
tomorrow morning.

908
01:18:55,814 --> 01:18:57,327
Twig...

909
01:18:57,694 --> 01:18:59,650
I want you to listen to me.

910
01:19:00,814 --> 01:19:05,171
It's best if you grab your things
and come with me right now.

911
01:19:05,271 --> 01:19:07,644
- I can't.
- Yes you can.

912
01:19:08,414 --> 01:19:10,370
Sooner or later

913
01:19:10,734 --> 01:19:14,488
the cops will figure out that it was
your dad who has done this thing.

914
01:19:14,588 --> 01:19:17,487
When they do, they are
gonna lock him away.

915
01:19:18,574 --> 01:19:22,394
Then they will take you
and put you with another family.

916
01:19:22,494 --> 01:19:24,724
- No, they won't.
- Yes, they will.

917
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:27,306
That's the truth.

918
01:19:28,978 --> 01:19:31,858
You're gonna end up
in a worthless state house.

919
01:19:32,530 --> 01:19:34,748
Do you know what that means?

920
01:19:36,863 --> 01:19:40,014
It's the worst thing
that could happen to a kid.

921
01:19:40,114 --> 01:19:42,413
I don't want that
to happen to you.

922
01:19:43,303 --> 01:19:46,056
If you want to come with me,
I'll take you out of here.

923
01:19:46,156 --> 01:19:47,816
We'll hide out for a while.

924
01:19:49,401 --> 01:19:52,520
When Tobe's better we'll come
down here to get her too.

925
01:19:55,954 --> 01:19:57,910
What do you say, bud?

926
01:19:58,714 --> 01:20:00,705
Wanna go with me?

927
01:20:01,957 --> 01:20:03,393
Yes.

928
01:20:03,792 --> 01:20:05,307
All right.

929
01:20:06,213 --> 01:20:09,713
Then pack a bag
and get me a blanket,

930
01:20:09,813 --> 01:20:12,281
we'll meet in
the back alley, okay.

931
01:21:01,491 --> 01:21:03,325
C'mon, champ.

932
01:21:21,618 --> 01:21:23,118
Mr. Summers.

933
01:21:23,218 --> 01:21:24,675
She's up.

934
01:21:48,040 --> 01:21:49,947
What happened?

935
01:21:52,634 --> 01:21:54,357
You've passed out.

936
01:21:54,457 --> 01:21:55,949
I feel...

937
01:21:56,049 --> 01:21:58,059
really strange.

938
01:22:07,167 --> 01:22:08,705
Where is Lonnie?

939
01:22:47,755 --> 01:22:50,906
This is about as high up
as you can get around here.

940
01:22:55,115 --> 01:22:57,071
Are you crying, bud?

941
01:22:58,115 --> 01:22:59,673
Sorry.

942
01:23:03,315 --> 01:23:07,354
Never be sorry for crying,
ain't no shame in that.

943
01:23:12,911 --> 01:23:14,946
I try not to cry in front

944
01:23:15,046 --> 01:23:17,471
someone i think is against
me, but that's about it.

945
01:23:27,314 --> 01:23:29,145
Is Tobe gonna be okay?

946
01:23:32,314 --> 01:23:34,464
Is that what you're
worried about?

947
01:23:41,620 --> 01:23:43,798
Yeah, she is.
She's gonna be fine.

948
01:23:47,559 --> 01:23:48,893
What's going on?

949
01:23:48,993 --> 01:23:50,806
They're not in here.

950
01:23:50,906 --> 01:23:52,319
Lonnie!

951
01:23:52,630 --> 01:23:54,104
Hey, Lonnie! Lon!

952
01:24:20,741 --> 01:24:23,305
A guy in Santa Corida
spotted him.

953
01:24:25,703 --> 01:24:29,059
His name is Martin Lassen,
he's a local from Receda.

954
01:24:29,303 --> 01:24:32,261
He did a year in Chino
for robbery.

955
01:25:05,930 --> 01:25:07,465
Hey, bud.

956
01:25:07,565 --> 01:25:09,950
C'mon, let's take a walk.
I wanna show you somethin'.

957
01:25:10,637 --> 01:25:12,061
What?

958
01:25:14,074 --> 01:25:15,771
Come on, just trust me.

959
01:25:20,135 --> 01:25:21,518
C'mon.

960
01:25:44,344 --> 01:25:46,294
You hold on that for a while.

961
01:25:53,374 --> 01:25:54,930
Where're you goin'?

962
01:25:55,374 --> 01:25:56,909
I'm right here.

963
01:25:57,596 --> 01:25:59,222
I ain't goin' anywhere.

964
01:26:06,295 --> 01:26:07,750
You there?

965
01:26:08,154 --> 01:26:09,810
Yeay, I'm right with you.

966
01:26:10,416 --> 01:26:12,679
You're ok.
Just work with that pile.

967
01:26:38,143 --> 01:26:39,678
What was that?

968
01:26:39,778 --> 01:26:42,528
That's just another
scared creature like us.

969
01:26:54,967 --> 01:26:56,583
Dont' run.

970
01:26:57,654 --> 01:26:59,876
Move, but don't move
like they're moves.

971
01:27:01,270 --> 01:27:03,189
Move like a panther.
Move confident.

972
01:27:04,694 --> 01:27:05,825
And you will be.

973
01:27:16,678 --> 01:27:18,415
Harlan?

974
01:27:25,561 --> 01:27:26,643
Harlan?

975
01:28:46,269 --> 01:28:47,340
Hey.

976
01:28:48,137 --> 01:28:49,127
Hey.

977
01:29:03,371 --> 01:29:05,068
Where are we?

978
01:29:39,248 --> 01:29:42,076
That horse ain't too happy
with me. I don't blame him.

979
01:29:42,399 --> 01:29:43,753
Nah, he's fine.

980
01:29:53,601 --> 01:29:54,955
Hell.

981
01:30:00,641 --> 01:30:02,822
It sure ain't like
I paid a while ago.

982
01:30:04,034 --> 01:30:05,933
I'm sorry about that.

983
01:30:06,033 --> 01:30:07,752
No, it's fine.

984
01:30:09,116 --> 01:30:11,966
You know there's still
real cowboys down here?

985
01:30:13,075 --> 01:30:15,675
They call each other
partner in a minute.

986
01:30:16,307 --> 01:30:18,449
They roll hard trail
with each other.

987
01:30:31,093 --> 01:30:32,810
You know what, Lonnie?

988
01:30:42,969 --> 01:30:44,463
You gotta get some sleep.

989
01:32:49,862 --> 01:32:52,146
Isn't that where you work?
- Nope.

990
01:32:52,246 --> 01:32:55,033
It sure would be a funny
coincidence, though.

991
01:32:58,631 --> 01:33:00,468
Would you take a turn with me?

992
01:33:03,296 --> 01:33:06,902
I don't reckon I'm worthy to dance
with a lady such as yourself.

993
01:33:08,513 --> 01:33:10,559
Well, I am asking you!

994
01:33:12,949 --> 01:33:15,292
- All right.
- Good, let's dance.

995
01:33:15,392 --> 01:33:17,130
See you in a second.

996
01:33:18,509 --> 01:33:20,932
- I believe this is yours.
- Thanks.

997
01:33:24,549 --> 01:33:28,751
Let's make room for our new
marshall and his lady.

998
01:33:30,836 --> 01:33:33,462
- Duty calls, I'll catch
you later. - Sure thing.

999
01:34:06,322 --> 01:34:07,939
Harlan!

1000
01:34:47,118 --> 01:34:48,532
Harlan!

1001
01:34:54,040 --> 01:34:56,444
- Don't take another step.
- Take it easy.

1002
01:34:56,937 --> 01:34:58,689
You take it easy.

1003
01:34:59,257 --> 01:35:01,532
Come on, Twig, come down
untie that horse.

1004
01:35:01,777 --> 01:35:03,176
Lonnie, get out of there.

1005
01:35:06,537 --> 01:35:08,284
Wade, yout take another step
towards that boy,

1006
01:35:08,384 --> 01:35:10,212
and I put the next one
in your head.

1007
01:35:10,312 --> 01:35:12,645
Look, nobody is
gonna shoot anybody.

1008
01:35:12,745 --> 01:35:17,540
- Let's put the guns down and talk.
- Put your gun down, now!

1009
01:35:17,817 --> 01:35:20,570
Easy, with a thumb and
a finger, real slow.

1010
01:35:22,977 --> 01:35:25,583
You too, drop that belt.

1011
01:35:26,128 --> 01:35:28,010
Go on, drop it!

1012
01:35:34,617 --> 01:35:36,817
Come on, Lonnie,
untie the horse.

1013
01:35:36,977 --> 01:35:39,927
- He shot Tobe!
- Shut your fucking mouth!

1014
01:35:40,027 --> 01:35:41,545
The girl's not dead.

1015
01:35:41,645 --> 01:35:43,361
You can tell the police
all the lies you want,

1016
01:35:43,461 --> 01:35:45,357
but you and me
both know you killed her.

1017
01:35:45,457 --> 01:35:48,277
- You're out of your fucking mind!
- Lonnie knows the truth too!

1018
01:35:48,377 --> 01:35:51,090
- Nutcase, you lied to my son!
- Harlan!

1019
01:36:08,977 --> 01:36:11,172
Come on, Lonnie!

1020
01:36:15,617 --> 01:36:16,970
Let's go.

1021
01:36:39,577 --> 01:36:40,930
Damn!

1022
01:36:48,579 --> 01:36:51,488
- You okay? - Yes, you take that
and press against that.

1023
01:36:51,588 --> 01:36:53,456
Press it right there.

1024
01:36:53,754 --> 01:36:55,888
C'mon, press it, press it.

1025
01:36:55,988 --> 01:36:58,093
We gotta get off this ridge.

1026
01:37:45,767 --> 01:37:49,253
We've gotta get out of here,
help me get on my feet.

1027
01:37:51,044 --> 01:37:52,690
And Lightning?

1028
01:37:53,064 --> 01:37:54,490
Go!

1029
01:38:13,077 --> 01:38:14,612
Stay down.

1030
01:38:19,985 --> 01:38:21,674
Will you be all right?

1031
01:38:21,774 --> 01:38:23,455
Hope so.

1032
01:38:23,555 --> 01:38:25,705
Don't wanna die
in a place like this.

1033
01:38:26,795 --> 01:38:28,547
I don't like it in here.

1034
01:38:41,103 --> 01:38:42,548
Listen,

1035
01:38:42,915 --> 01:38:46,032
stand up and see who's outside.

1036
01:38:49,875 --> 01:38:52,150
- It's Lightning.
- What's he doing?

1037
01:38:52,250 --> 01:38:55,397
- Nothing, just standing there.
- He'll give us away.

1038
01:38:56,515 --> 01:38:59,951
Bring him around back,
put him in the garage.

1039
01:39:00,195 --> 01:39:02,072
Wait, look at me.

1040
01:39:02,435 --> 01:39:04,744
You can do it, go on!

1041
01:39:05,275 --> 01:39:07,231
Go, you can do it!

1042
01:39:44,695 --> 01:39:48,191
He was scared, but he's ok now.

1043
01:40:31,672 --> 01:40:32,710
Stop!

1044
01:40:37,395 --> 01:40:38,953
Don't!

1045
01:40:57,290 --> 01:40:59,147
Stay here.

1046
01:41:04,155 --> 01:41:06,111
Listen, he shot your sister.

1047
01:41:06,715 --> 01:41:08,990
Lonnie, he's the one
who shot Tobe.

1048
01:41:09,286 --> 01:41:12,511
- You're lying!
- She'll tell you.

1049
01:41:12,755 --> 01:41:14,507
She'll tell you.

1050
01:42:37,147 --> 01:42:39,066
What do we say?

1051
01:42:52,494 --> 01:42:54,029
Don't say anything.

1052
01:42:57,947 --> 01:42:59,422
Just thinking.

1053
01:43:24,215 --> 01:43:28,073
