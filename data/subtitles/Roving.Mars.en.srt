1
00:00:25,476 --> 00:00:31,547
Space exploration began with dreaming.
Thousands of years of humans staring

2
00:00:31,662 --> 00:00:37,212
into the heavens and wondering, "How
did this begin? What else is out there?"

3
00:00:37,613 --> 00:00:41,251
The earliest answers
were given in myth and poetry.

4
00:00:41,971 --> 00:00:45,333
Now, they are sought
by space-age technology.

5
00:00:46,034 --> 00:00:48,973
And while each mission increases
our knowledge,

6
00:00:49,586 --> 00:00:52,759
it also leads our imagination
further and further.

7
00:00:53,974 --> 00:00:58,942
How did life begin? Did it happen
more than once in the universe?

8
00:00:59,757 --> 00:01:02,354
The answer may lie on Mars.

9
00:01:09,067 --> 00:01:16,383
ROVING MARS

10
00:01:32,287 --> 00:01:35,628
Mars today is desolate, dry, and barren.

11
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:39,201
And at first glance, has little in
common with our own planet.

12
00:01:40,190 --> 00:01:44,925
And yet from orbit, we see what looked
like dried-up lakebeds and canyons.

13
00:01:46,583 --> 00:01:48,794
Clues that three or four billion years ago,

14
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:52,899
Mars may once have been wetter and
more Earth-like.

15
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,676
And since life blossomed here on Earth,
the question is:

16
00:01:58,199 --> 00:02:01,049
Did it ever take place on Mars?

17
00:02:12,873 --> 00:02:17,873
To answer this question, NASA's jet
propulsion laboratory brought together a team

18
00:02:17,974 --> 00:02:22,938
of scientists and engineers whose mission
was to discover if Mars ever had

19
00:02:23,039 --> 00:02:25,236
what was needed to support life.

20
00:02:26,636 --> 00:02:29,915
A geologist and astronomer at
Cornell University,

21
00:02:30,016 --> 00:02:33,411
Steve Squyres, was chosen to lead
the science team.

22
00:02:33,512 --> 00:02:37,455
As principal investigator, he would direct
the team's search for

23
00:02:37,656 --> 00:02:40,891
life's most essential resource: water.

24
00:02:42,487 --> 00:02:45,688
I've been working on the question of water
on Mars for twenty-eight years.

25
00:02:45,789 --> 00:02:49,789
You can't learn what you need from
a telescope. You must be a geologist.

26
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:54,500
A geologist is sort of like a detective
at the scene of a crime.

27
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,600
Um, somethin' happened here a long time ago.
What happened?

28
00:02:57,735 --> 00:03:01,984
Was it warm? Was it wet?
Could life have existed here?

29
00:03:02,185 --> 00:03:05,110
The key is in the clues and the
clues are in the rocks.

30
00:03:06,473 --> 00:03:09,025
On Earth, a geologist can find
an interesting rock,

31
00:03:09,226 --> 00:03:11,695
crack it open with a hammer,
and just look at what's inside.

32
00:03:11,696 --> 00:03:15,341
But we're not ready to send
human geologist to Mars yet.

33
00:03:22,242 --> 00:03:24,218
So we had to build a robot geologist.

34
00:03:24,419 --> 00:03:27,765
And the only place this could be done
was NASA's jet propulsion laboratory

35
00:03:27,866 --> 00:03:30,622
where some of the most innovative
engineers in the country work.

36
00:03:31,973 --> 00:03:34,754
We're talking about a robot.
A rover that can go to Mars,

37
00:03:34,855 --> 00:03:39,295
land on the surface, take a look around,
and then cut the cord and go

38
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,139
carrying everything it needs with it:

39
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:48,766
cameras, instruments, communications
equipment. Everything.

40
00:03:50,782 --> 00:03:53,715
Something that can look inside rocks
and that can tell us

41
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:55,670
what clues those rocks hold.

42
00:04:03,697 --> 00:04:05,526
This place, to me, is almost sacred.

43
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:09,282
This is the place where our rovers
are assembled for the last time

44
00:04:09,417 --> 00:04:10,808
before they leave this planet.

45
00:04:11,238 --> 00:04:14,553
Everything that we do in this room must
be perfect.

46
00:04:20,615 --> 00:04:23,161
Over four thousand people have worked
on this mission.

47
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:27,478
For every single piece of this spacecraft
down to the tiniest one,

48
00:04:27,613 --> 00:04:30,987
there was a person somewhere who conceived
it. Who nurtured it.

49
00:04:31,122 --> 00:04:33,740
Who took it from a concept to
something real.

50
00:04:38,242 --> 00:04:42,267
It's taken this team three years to design
and build and test these rovers

51
00:04:42,402 --> 00:04:44,051
and we still have work to do.

52
00:04:47,802 --> 00:04:50,875
We can only launch when the two planets are
properly aligned

53
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:52,745
and that's just a month away.

54
00:04:53,408 --> 00:04:55,865
But we still have tests to run.
We're working in shifts.

55
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,688
We're working almost around the clock
and we don't know if we're gonna make it.

56
00:05:08,114 --> 00:05:11,305
There's no one person who can really get
their arms around the whole thing and say

57
00:05:11,933 --> 00:05:15,322
"I understand everything about this vehicle."

58
00:05:16,991 --> 00:05:19,230
It's now burst the bounds
of our brains.

59
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:25,222
Well this rover is-is more than just
a roving geologist.

60
00:05:25,323 --> 00:05:28,909
This rover also has to be a-a spacecraft.

61
00:05:29,898 --> 00:05:32,426
It actually has to fly itself from
Earth to Mars.

62
00:05:32,797 --> 00:05:37,389
In addition, it has to do the very subtle
and quick timing control

63
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:40,975
of all the things that happen as it enters
and lands the vehicle.

64
00:05:40,976 --> 00:05:46,156
We had to stuff all that intelligence
and capability into

65
00:05:46,257 --> 00:05:51,693
that little six-wheel vehicle back there, so
that it could get there safely on its own.

66
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:58,317
I call our spacecraft "The Origami Spacecraft,"
which means it's really

67
00:05:58,418 --> 00:06:00,683
a complicated series of folds.

68
00:06:00,784 --> 00:06:04,180
We've had to punch holes in the lander
pedals for the wheels to snake through.

69
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:09,331
We've had to fold everything into these
complicated shapes to get this system

70
00:06:09,432 --> 00:06:11,655
to fit inside this tetrahedron.

71
00:06:15,617 --> 00:06:20,028
It's beautiful, but at a price.
And that price in this case is complexity.

72
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:27,366
There have been missions to Mars
since the sixties.

73
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:30,555
There've been dozens of them.
But two-thirds of those missions failed.

74
00:06:32,303 --> 00:06:33,991
Mars is a spacecraft graveyard.

75
00:06:37,674 --> 00:06:42,193
A spacecraft has to travel about three
hundred million miles to get to Mars

76
00:06:42,294 --> 00:06:44,401
at about sixty thousand miles an hour.

77
00:06:45,013 --> 00:06:46,903
But it still takes seven months
to get there.

78
00:06:48,117 --> 00:06:51,672
Trying to hit our landing sites from that
distance is like shooting a basketball

79
00:06:51,773 --> 00:06:56,329
from Los Angeles to New York and having it
go through the hoop without touching the rim.

80
00:07:03,744 --> 00:07:07,374
The smallest mistake on our part
could put the whole mission in jeopardy.

81
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:11,210
Two of the last three missions
to Mars were failures.

82
00:07:12,187 --> 00:07:14,211
One spacecraft burned up in
the Martian atmosphere,

83
00:07:14,312 --> 00:07:15,868
the other one crashed on the surface.

84
00:07:17,827 --> 00:07:20,453
This time, NASA decided to send
two identical spacecraft

85
00:07:20,554 --> 00:07:22,443
to double our chances of success.

86
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:29,161
The two rovers are named Spirit
and Opportunity.

87
00:07:32,188 --> 00:07:33,938
The rovers have very different
personalities.

88
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:36,838
They did even when they were babies,
back when we were first building 'em.

89
00:07:37,528 --> 00:07:40,440
Spirit was our troublesome first-born.

90
00:07:40,541 --> 00:07:42,888
Every test we ran, it seemed
that we ran on Spirit first

91
00:07:42,989 --> 00:07:45,603
and the first time you try
something it usually doesn't work.

92
00:07:46,231 --> 00:07:49,002
So we'd run these tests on Spirit and
they'd fail and we'd try to fix things

93
00:07:49,103 --> 00:07:51,393
and we'd run another test
and that would fail too.

94
00:07:51,394 --> 00:07:53,373
By the time we got to Opportunity,

95
00:07:53,474 --> 00:07:56,237
we'd learn stuff and things
went much more smoothly.

96
00:08:14,525 --> 00:08:17,718
The biggest problem was that we
underestimated the size and weight

97
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:21,810
of the rovers. Once we realized how
big they really had to be,

98
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:22,811
we also realized that the
landing system we planned to use

99
00:08:22,912 --> 00:08:27,883
couldn't get them to the ground
in one piece.

100
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:31,589
As the rover got heavier,
the lander got heavier.

101
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,637
As the lander got heavier,
the arrow shell got heavier.

102
00:08:33,738 --> 00:08:35,587
The whole thing got heavier
and heavier and heavier.

103
00:08:35,588 --> 00:08:40,809
From the very beginning on this mission,
it seemed like nothing was going right.

104
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:44,756
The air bags are like the air bags in
your car but way more expensive.

105
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:47,946
They inflate explosively around the
vehicle and they cushion the landing.

106
00:08:52,377 --> 00:08:55,182
The first time we tested them,
they tore open and deflated.

107
00:09:00,046 --> 00:09:01,465
The setbacks we knew
they are going to happen.

108
00:09:01,566 --> 00:09:03,399
I always tell people when
you start these projects.

109
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,198
Uh, the same thing probably what happened
to Lewis and Clark and, uh,

110
00:09:07,299 --> 00:09:08,697
Captain Cook in their exploration.

111
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:12,482
Uh, what is guaranteed is that
there will be setbacks.

112
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:15,847
Three...two...one.

113
00:09:17,248 --> 00:09:20,113
These rovers have to land
using a supersonic parachute.

114
00:09:23,255 --> 00:09:26,533
The parachute design we
thought would work ripped to shreds.

115
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:29,899
The lander had gotten so heavy that
the chute just couldn't handle it.

116
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:33,112
We were practically out of time and
all we had was a chute design

117
00:09:33,213 --> 00:09:36,827
would destroy
the spacecraft when we tried to land.

118
00:09:36,928 --> 00:09:40,667
We had to build a whole 'nother set of new designs.

119
00:09:40,768 --> 00:09:42,749
No less than three or four
designs that we had to test

120
00:09:47,327 --> 00:09:52,081
We were running out of money,
we were running out of time.

121
00:09:53,813 --> 00:09:56,501
Uh, well, I mean, the drop was successful.

122
00:09:56,602 --> 00:09:57,074
Yeah.

123
00:09:57,175 --> 00:10:01,184
See, uh, the fact that, uh, the parachute
exploded...not a good thing.

124
00:10:01,285 --> 00:10:04,397
Well, yeah, I'd rather have it
happen here than any place else.

125
00:10:04,446 --> 00:10:04,846
Mars.

126
00:10:04,947 --> 00:10:05,347
Yeah.

127
00:10:05,448 --> 00:10:10,065
That's right. Unfortunately, strictly
speaking, that chute that just exploded

128
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,228
was the chute that we
were planning on taking to Mars.

129
00:10:50,487 --> 00:10:52,977
Mars is a tough place to send a spacecraft.

130
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:55,788
The average temperature is sixty degrees
below zero.

131
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,803
It goes down to a hundred below zero
at night.

132
00:10:59,037 --> 00:11:01,881
There can be dust storms
that darken the skies for months at a time.

133
00:11:03,247 --> 00:11:05,632
But if the rovers make it, they'll give us
the experience of

134
00:11:05,733 --> 00:11:07,984
what it would be like to be on Mars.

135
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:11,295
We'll be able to look off into the distance
and say, "Yeah. I'd like to go there,"

136
00:11:11,396 --> 00:11:14,799
and then actually go and see what we find.

137
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:28,486
The rover's arm has the same dimensions
as a human arm with a shoulder,

138
00:11:28,587 --> 00:11:33,218
an elbow, and a wrist. The arm tucks up
tight under the front of the vehicle

139
00:11:33,319 --> 00:11:35,910
for when we drive around. But when
we get to a rock that we want to examine,

140
00:11:36,011 --> 00:11:41,195
the arm unstows and reaches out
using all of its joints

141
00:11:41,296 --> 00:11:45,393
to place the instruments on a rock
and to begin to study them.

142
00:11:49,078 --> 00:11:53,884
The hand has four fingers. One is a
microscope, two are spectrometers

143
00:11:53,985 --> 00:11:56,108
to tell us, in detail, what the rocks are made of.

144
00:11:56,209 --> 00:11:57,880
And the fourth one is called the RAT.

145
00:11:58,081 --> 00:12:00,137
The Rock Abrasion Tool.

146
00:12:03,171 --> 00:12:06,451
MARS

147
00:12:07,908 --> 00:12:12,052
To examine the rocks, we've got to
get to them and Mars is very bumpy.

148
00:12:12,153 --> 00:12:15,034
So to deal with the bumps, our engineers
came up with something called a

149
00:12:15,169 --> 00:12:19,819
rocker-bogie suspension system. It's a very
clever design that allows each of

150
00:12:19,954 --> 00:12:23,403
the six wheels to go up and over
a rock independently

151
00:12:23,504 --> 00:12:25,814
while the rover itself hardly tilts at all.

152
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,516
'Kay. Come on in, guys.
Now stay clear, watch it. Watch it.

153
00:12:34,617 --> 00:12:36,663
Stay clear of this thing 'cause
it's gonna move in a second.

154
00:12:36,764 --> 00:12:39,011
Watch! Watch the wheels. Watch the wheels.
Watch the wheels. Now watch.

155
00:12:39,112 --> 00:12:40,958
It goes way beyond this single mission.

156
00:12:41,059 --> 00:12:41,636
See that?

157
00:12:41,737 --> 00:12:43,542
The eventual goal is to send humans to Mars.

158
00:12:44,043 --> 00:12:46,976
But the first person to walk on
Mars is not an astronaut today.

159
00:12:46,977 --> 00:12:49,762
It's someone in high school.
Or in elementary school.

160
00:12:51,275 --> 00:12:53,982
So it's turnin' in place, then when it gets
lined up just right,

161
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,165
we're gonna drive it backwards.

162
00:13:02,687 --> 00:13:05,892
We've invested so much work...
so many years...

163
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,828
so much of our hopes and our
dreams into these rovers.

164
00:13:11,027 --> 00:13:12,452
And then when you think about
where they're going,

165
00:13:12,553 --> 00:13:16,821
the ride they're gonna get on
that rocket, the transit through space,

166
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,849
what it's gonna be like when
that parachute goes out

167
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:21,189
at mach two goin' through
the Martian atmosphere....

168
00:13:30,455 --> 00:13:34,507
You're standing next to this little robot
and you realize it's gonna spend eternity on

169
00:13:34,608 --> 00:13:40,043
the surface of another world.
It's goin' to another planet for real.

170
00:13:44,966 --> 00:13:47,596
And once they're gone, that's it.
After the rovers launch,

171
00:13:47,697 --> 00:13:49,608
we're never gonna see
them again with our own eyes.

172
00:13:51,346 --> 00:13:54,949
We've done everything we can to prepare them
for the dangers they'll have to face.

173
00:13:55,913 --> 00:13:57,944
But it's gonna be very hard to say goodbye.

174
00:14:54,288 --> 00:14:58,635
NASA

175
00:15:18,901 --> 00:15:21,679
Spirit will be launched first, then
Opportunity, three weeks later.

176
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:26,961
Mars and Earth are both orbiting the sun so
they're always moving

177
00:15:27,062 --> 00:15:30,744
relative to each other.
Every twenty-six months,

178
00:15:30,845 --> 00:15:33,884
there's a brief interval when the
planets are lined up just right.

179
00:15:35,239 --> 00:15:39,491
At that time, and only at that time,
we have enough rocket fuel to make it.

180
00:15:40,612 --> 00:15:42,198
So this is our one shot.

181
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:43,138
We don't fire a rocket motor
all the way to Mars.

182
00:17:43,239 --> 00:17:48,994
We don't need to. We just place the
spacecraft on a trajectory

183
00:17:49,095 --> 00:17:52,519
to Mars and let it
coast for seven months and three hundred

184
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:55,189
million miles until it reaches the planet.

185
00:17:57,043 --> 00:18:00,057
Once it's been pushed on it's way
to Mars by the launch vehicle

186
00:18:00,158 --> 00:18:05,035
it has to, uh, maintain its orientation
toward the sun and it needs to be able

187
00:18:05,136 --> 00:18:08,746
to correct its orientation and
direction so that it would hit Mars

188
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:14,918
and-and get to this very, very tiny,
uh, spot on Mars that we're aiming for.

189
00:18:15,019 --> 00:18:20,329
So all that has to take place over the
course of the seven month journey.

190
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:34,207
7 MONTHS AFTER LAUNCH

191
00:18:36,327 --> 00:18:38,950
SPIRIT LANDING DAY

192
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,230
Planning is when the real challenge begins.

193
00:18:50,531 --> 00:18:54,458
Mars is so far away it takes about ten
minutes for a radio signal to travel

194
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:59,014
one way between Mars and Earth.
But it's only six minutes from when

195
00:18:59,115 --> 00:19:01,491
you first hit the top of the Martian
atmosphere to when

196
00:19:01,592 --> 00:19:02,775
we're bouncing on the surface.

197
00:19:03,730 --> 00:19:06,559
So there's nothing we can do
to help when it's time to land.

198
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,808
The rovers are on their own, and we're just
passive, passionately interested observers

199
00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:13,849
waiting for a radio signal that shows
whether or not they've survived.

200
00:19:13,850 --> 00:19:23,483
Not going to be an issue. The current
reported temperature is about zero degrees

201
00:19:23,618 --> 00:19:29,065
Celsius which, um, is close to the
limit-- the flight allowable limit.

202
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,503
However...
Landing a spacecraft on Mars is so complicated.

203
00:19:31,604 --> 00:19:33,364
There are so many things that can go wrong.

204
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:37,520
The flight computer has to know precisely
the right time to deploy the parachute.

205
00:19:37,621 --> 00:19:41,631
If it deploys it too high, when the
parachute opens the wind forces

206
00:19:41,732 --> 00:19:43,062
will just rip it to shreds.

207
00:19:43,163 --> 00:19:47,589
If we deploy the parachute too low of an
altitude, it won't open in time

208
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:49,374
and it
will just crash right into the ground.

209
00:19:51,574 --> 00:19:54,204
The trick is, every time there's
some critical event:

210
00:19:54,305 --> 00:19:58,218
the parachute deploys, the heat
shield falls away, we change the frequency

211
00:19:58,319 --> 00:19:59,931
of the radio signal.

212
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:04,142
And so Polly's sitting at her console and
she's looking for these changing frequencies

213
00:20:04,243 --> 00:20:08,655
and when the number changes,
she knows that this event has happened.

214
00:20:08,756 --> 00:20:10,515
That event has happened.

215
00:20:14,105 --> 00:20:17,924
Flight director, Jason Willis, reporting
that all systems are go for entry

216
00:20:18,025 --> 00:20:20,260
descent and landing.
We are roughly eleven minutes,

217
00:20:20,361 --> 00:20:22,470
forty-eight seconds from landing at the
Gusev Crater

218
00:20:22,605 --> 00:20:23,862
in the southern hemisphere of Mars.

219
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,291
Atmospheric entry in three...two...one.

220
00:20:46,705 --> 00:20:48,804
We have just passed one minute
to atmospheric entry.

221
00:20:48,905 --> 00:20:50,418
Current altitude: one hundred
and twenty-one miles.

222
00:20:50,519 --> 00:20:53,036
Current velocity: twelve thousand
eighty-four miles per hour.

223
00:20:55,601 --> 00:20:57,779
We are now at an altitude
of seventy-three miles,

224
00:20:57,880 --> 00:21:00,786
moving at a speed of twelve thousand
one hundred ninety-two miles per hour.

225
00:21:00,887 --> 00:21:08,588
Expected parachute deploy in five seconds.
Four...three...two...one...mark.

226
00:21:12,677 --> 00:21:18,350
We're awaiting confirmation the
parachute has deployed.

227
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:21,754
Parachute's been detected.

228
00:21:24,525 --> 00:21:25,546
Heat shield deployed event.

229
00:21:25,747 --> 00:21:30,415
Uh, spacecraft reporting that heat
shield has indeed jettisoned...

230
00:21:30,078 --> 00:21:32,815
Spacecraft reporting lander has separated.
Moving at a speed of

231
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:35,310
one hundred seventy-three miles per hour.
We are near our terminal velocity.

232
00:21:39,971 --> 00:21:41,639
Expected retro rocket ignition on my mark.
Mark.

233
00:21:49,305 --> 00:21:51,184
At this point in time,
we should be on the ground.

234
00:21:56,931 --> 00:21:59,975
Any signal that we receive from now
indicates the vehicle would be alive,

235
00:22:00,076 --> 00:22:02,823
on the ground, and bouncing.

236
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:13,454
The spacecraft has to survive all the
bounces for the landing to be a success.

237
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:22,369
No signal at the moment.

238
00:22:24,307 --> 00:22:25,569
Standby.

239
00:22:27,337 --> 00:22:29,044
Signal strength is currently intermittent.

240
00:22:32,413 --> 00:22:34,320
We don't see a signal at the moment.

241
00:22:35,224 --> 00:22:38,042
Right. We saw an intermittent signal
that indicated we were bouncing

242
00:22:38,143 --> 00:22:43,077
however...however, we currently
do not have signal from the spacecraft.

243
00:22:43,915 --> 00:22:44,818
Okay.
Please stand by.

244
00:22:49,706 --> 00:22:51,705
This time, we're approximately ten minutes
after landing.

245
00:22:51,806 --> 00:22:53,486
The vehicle should have
rolled to a stop by now.

246
00:22:53,621 --> 00:22:58,237
The deep space network stations at Goldstone
and Canberra are still searching for the signal.

247
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,038
They see it.

248
00:23:08,344 --> 00:23:09,710
What do we see?

249
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,931
We've got the signal!

250
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:24,960
The first thing we have to do after
we land is open our solar panels

251
00:24:25,061 --> 00:24:28,091
to the sun so we'll have some power.
This charges up the batteries.

252
00:24:33,477 --> 00:24:37,761
After that, we can deploy the camera
mast so the rover can see

253
00:24:37,862 --> 00:24:40,550
and deploy the antenna so
the rover can talk to us.

254
00:25:01,428 --> 00:25:03,455
Our first pictures from Mars!

255
00:25:22,365 --> 00:25:24,830
Look at that!
That's looking down on our vehicle.

256
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:54,270
We could not have imaged returns
as early as this, as clear as this,

257
00:25:54,471 --> 00:25:59,291
as successful as this, and in the
volume that it has been.

258
00:26:00,646 --> 00:26:03,535
Uh, ladies and gentlemen, Mars.

259
00:26:23,339 --> 00:26:27,460
We sent Spirit to Gusev Crater, a crater
in the southern highlands of Mars.

260
00:26:27,561 --> 00:26:29,390
It's a hundred miles in diameter.

261
00:26:29,491 --> 00:26:34,409
What makes it special is that emptying
into it is a giant watercarved channel.

262
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,451
So Gusev is a hole in the ground
with a dry river flowing into it.

263
00:26:37,552 --> 00:26:40,384
There has to have been a lake
in this crater once upon a time.

264
00:26:41,908 --> 00:26:44,152
We sent Spirit there to seek out sediments.

265
00:26:44,253 --> 00:26:48,224
To look for sedimentary rocks that
were laid down long ago in that lake.

266
00:26:50,487 --> 00:26:52,487
Once we landed, I think the scariest
part of the whole mission

267
00:26:52,588 --> 00:26:55,294
was the initial unfolding of the rover.

268
00:27:02,289 --> 00:27:05,924
There are so many gears and springs
and motors and hinges and latches

269
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:08,778
that have to work just right or you're done.

270
00:27:19,550 --> 00:27:21,787
Once everything's deployed,
we're ready to start lookin' around.

271
00:27:22,547 --> 00:27:26,089
We can look off into the distance with our
cameras and with our infrared spectrometer,

272
00:27:26,190 --> 00:27:31,105
and we can learn a lot from a distance of
fifty yards, a hundred yards about what the

273
00:27:31,206 --> 00:27:35,350
look like and what they're made of.
Then, if we see a rock that has a texture or

274
00:27:35,485 --> 00:27:38,530
a composition that looks interesting to us,
we can drive over to it

275
00:27:38,631 --> 00:27:42,171
and check it out in detail.

276
00:27:50,638 --> 00:27:53,761
For driving, the rover has these kinda
googly-eyed cameras that it uses

277
00:27:53,862 --> 00:27:57,346
to take images of the terrain in front
of it. They've got wide-angle lenses

278
00:27:57,447 --> 00:28:03,028
and they provide sort of a fish-eye view.
Spirit uses these pictures to

279
00:28:03,129 --> 00:28:06,313
make it's own decisions about how to drive.

280
00:28:06,414 --> 00:28:08,726
It'll drive forward and then take
a look at a rock and say,

281
00:28:08,827 --> 00:28:11,777
"That's too big, I have to go around that."
Or, maybe it'll see smooth sailing

282
00:28:11,878 --> 00:28:14,013
and just move on.

283
00:28:14,905 --> 00:28:18,043
But we can actually program different
levels of courage or cowardice

284
00:28:18,144 --> 00:28:21,513
into the rover, telling it how aggressive it
should be depending on how dangerous

285
00:28:21,614 --> 00:28:26,118
we think the terrain is.

286
00:28:26,219 --> 00:28:30,672
These rovers are so complicated, that it
takes hours to get a set of commands right.

287
00:28:30,773 --> 00:28:34,275
So when we operate 'em, we'll normally
send commands to them just once a day.

288
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:40,252
The first rock that we looked at was this
one. We named it Adirondack.

289
00:28:41,572 --> 00:28:45,022
When a rock sits on the surface of a planet,
it can undergo what's called 'weathering.'

290
00:28:45,123 --> 00:28:48,834
When it's exposed to sunlight or humidity
or wind, the surface of the rock

291
00:28:48,935 --> 00:28:52,558
can be modified and the evidence of
how it formed can be destroyed.

292
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:56,376
So to get to the clues you need,
you have to get inside the rock

293
00:28:56,477 --> 00:28:58,553
below the weathered surface.

294
00:28:59,966 --> 00:29:03,040
The key to understanding Adirondack
was the rock abrasion tool.

295
00:29:03,141 --> 00:29:07,894
The RAT gives us the ability to grind into a
rock, exposing the unaltered

296
00:29:07,995 --> 00:29:09,648
evidence inside.

297
00:29:21,761 --> 00:29:26,613
So we put a RAT hole into Adirondack
and then we hit it with everything we had.

298
00:29:26,714 --> 00:29:28,954
We looked at it with our cameras,
we looked at it with our spectrometers,

299
00:29:29,055 --> 00:29:32,713
we looked at it with our microscope.
Adirondack is a piece of lava.

300
00:29:32,814 --> 00:29:35,983
It's not a sedimentary rock.
And every other rock around it

301
00:29:36,084 --> 00:29:39,864
is a piece of lava too. This was a huge
disappointment.

302
00:29:40,265 --> 00:29:43,859
We came to Gusev Crater looking
for sediments that were laid down

303
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:48,770
long ago in a lake, but what we
found was lava. Volcanic rock.

304
00:29:48,871 --> 00:29:52,673
The sedimentary rock must be there but it's
been buried under the lava

305
00:29:52,774 --> 00:29:56,086
and we couldn't get to it.

306
00:29:56,187 --> 00:29:59,086
When we realized that we hadn't
landed on the stuff we came for,

307
00:29:59,187 --> 00:30:03,005
we decided we had to go some place else.
A mile and a half away,

308
00:30:03,106 --> 00:30:06,478
there's this spectacular range
of hills called the Columbia Hills.

309
00:30:06,579 --> 00:30:10,917
You gotta remember that Spirit was designed
to go only six hundred yards

310
00:30:11,018 --> 00:30:13,656
over its lifetime.

311
00:30:13,757 --> 00:30:16,203
So we set out for those hills not
knowin' if we'd ever make it.

312
00:30:19,378 --> 00:30:22,723
Meanwhile, on the other side of Mars,
Opportunity was about to land.

313
00:30:49,623 --> 00:30:51,515
When Opportunity landed at Eagle Crater,

314
00:30:51,650 --> 00:30:56,374
it was a three-hundred million mile
interplanetary hole-in-one.

315
00:30:57,776 --> 00:31:00,802
We rolled to a stop right in
front of layered bedrock.

316
00:31:00,903 --> 00:31:06,924
Bedrock is geologic truth. Opportunity
landed in front of a Martian history book.

317
00:31:14,241 --> 00:31:17,161
When we drove off the lander
and looked at the soil in front of us,

318
00:31:17,262 --> 00:31:20,582
we saw that it was littered with what looked
like little round beads.

319
00:31:20,683 --> 00:31:24,353
An uncountable number
of little round things.

320
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:27,670
We took out our microscope,
we reached out,

321
00:31:27,771 --> 00:31:31,656
and looked at the soil in detail and
the picture that came down was astounding.

322
00:31:31,791 --> 00:31:37,564
They were perfect spheres.
I will remember for the rest of my life

323
00:31:37,665 --> 00:31:40,726
how I felt when I saw that first picture.

324
00:31:48,631 --> 00:31:50,923
When we got to the outcrop
and looked at it up close, we realized

325
00:31:51,024 --> 00:31:56,275
that the spheres are embedded in the
rock, like blueberries in a muffin.

326
00:31:56,376 --> 00:31:58,822
The rock erodes away and
the blueberries fall out.

327
00:31:58,923 --> 00:32:00,259
And roll down into the soil.

328
00:32:04,152 --> 00:32:06,159
The blueberries, it turns out,
are made of hematite,

329
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:09,778
a mineral that on Earth is
often formed in liquid water.

330
00:32:09,879 --> 00:32:14,191
Next, we found jarosite, which is a
mineral that couldn't have formed

331
00:32:14,292 --> 00:32:18,777
unless there had been water in the rocks.
So there was water underground here.

332
00:32:18,878 --> 00:32:23,772
Our most extraordinary discovery
came when we found ripples in the rocks.

333
00:32:23,873 --> 00:32:27,703
Ancient ripples that formed when water
flowed over sand on Mars

334
00:32:27,804 --> 00:32:29,226
billions of years ago.

335
00:32:29,327 --> 00:32:34,675
So there wasn't just water underground
here... there was water at the surface.

336
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:42,307
Opportunity discovered that
at this place billions of years ago,

337
00:32:42,408 --> 00:32:44,870
Mars was most
likely a habitable world.

338
00:32:44,971 --> 00:32:49,738
It was a place that, for some interval of
time, was suitable for some forms of life.

339
00:32:49,839 --> 00:32:52,898
Decades of work paid off with this discovery.

340
00:32:55,568 --> 00:32:59,685
Billions of years ago there were shallow,
occasional pools of water.

341
00:32:59,786 --> 00:33:02,016
Don't think an ocean, think of salt flats.

342
00:33:02,117 --> 00:33:04,893
And the water may not have
been a pretty blue.

343
00:33:04,994 --> 00:33:08,923
In fact, it may have been so acid
it dissolved iron out of the rocks

344
00:33:09,024 --> 00:33:12,614
and made wine-red pools under a
pink Martian sky.

345
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:32,177
All the discoveries that Opportunity
made about water

346
00:33:32,278 --> 00:33:36,858
happened in the first six weeks of the mission.
Everything went right for that rover.

347
00:33:36,959 --> 00:33:39,430
I call Opportunity
"Little Miss Perfect".

348
00:33:39,531 --> 00:33:43,032
Opportunity lands in this place
where the evidence is right there.

349
00:33:43,133 --> 00:33:46,114
The driving is
like a parking lot. Everything is perfect.

350
00:33:50,272 --> 00:33:53,884
Spirit, our kinda tough hard-working
blue collar rover lands

351
00:33:53,985 --> 00:33:58,337
in this awful, rocky, rugged place
on a lava plane a mile and a half from

352
00:33:58,438 --> 00:34:01,878
the nearest interesting rocks and has to
struggle for five months

353
00:34:01,979 --> 00:34:03,832
just to begin her mission.

354
00:34:07,058 --> 00:34:11,265
Spirit had to work for everything,
literally had to climb a mountain on Mars.

355
00:34:14,547 --> 00:34:17,111
We use the power that comes from the
sun to operate the vehicle

356
00:34:17,212 --> 00:34:20,764
and to charge the batteries.
So the solar arrays are essential.

357
00:34:20,865 --> 00:34:25,398
On the way to the Columbia Hills, Spirit's
solar rays were getting coated with dust.

358
00:34:25,499 --> 00:34:28,370
We were getting to the point where
Spirit was simply gonna die.

359
00:34:30,272 --> 00:34:34,516
Then, one wonderful day we, climbed
up onto the crest of a ridge where

360
00:34:34,617 --> 00:34:39,645
we were hit by not one but several gusts of
wind that just cleaned the solar arrays off.

361
00:34:39,746 --> 00:34:46,032
It was like having a brand new rover.
Spirit got high up in the Columbia Hills

362
00:34:46,133 --> 00:34:49,606
and started to find stuff that was different
from anything we'd seen.

363
00:34:49,707 --> 00:34:52,079
There were salt deposits in
the hills and there were rocks

364
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:56,849
that clearly had been altered by water.
It took months of work and struggle

365
00:34:56,950 --> 00:35:01,079
but Spirit finally showed us there had
been water on both sides of the planet.

366
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:03,211
She gave us exactly what we needed.

367
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:10,490
These rovers were designed
to last only ninety Mars days

368
00:35:10,591 --> 00:35:14,428
and they've already done many times that.
They've developed personalities.

369
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,653
They're work horses. They say,
"Push us. Ask us to do more.

370
00:35:17,754 --> 00:35:20,831
We can go further, we can go faster."
So we asked so much more

371
00:35:20,932 --> 00:35:24,443
than they were ever intended to.
And to our amazement, they'd do it.

372
00:35:28,852 --> 00:35:32,073
We don't know what will kill these rovers;
they do get old, motors break,

373
00:35:32,174 --> 00:35:35,548
lubrication goes away in the motors,
the wheels may stop turning.

374
00:35:35,649 --> 00:35:38,000
We have no idea what will happen.

375
00:35:43,201 --> 00:35:46,576
But they're not gonna last forever.
And as the dust keeps falling,

376
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:48,772
the solar arrays keep getting dirty.

377
00:35:48,873 --> 00:35:51,905
What could happen, with time,
is some day we won't be able

378
00:35:52,006 --> 00:35:54,360
to charge the batteries enough
to keep the rover warm at night.

379
00:35:54,461 --> 00:35:57,355
And if that happens,
the rover's going to get too cold.

380
00:35:57,456 --> 00:36:01,169
And one morning, it just won't wake up.

381
00:36:08,687 --> 00:36:12,728
Spirit and Opportunity have shown us that
once, three to four billion years ago,

382
00:36:12,829 --> 00:36:18,295
Mars had the essential ingredients for life.
So the next step is to seek out evidence

383
00:36:18,396 --> 00:36:19,296
of life itself. Right now,
we have one example of life. Us.

384
00:36:19,397 --> 00:36:27,324
We may be all there is.
We simply don't know.

385
00:36:27,325 --> 00:36:31,830
But if you can show that life
developed twice in one solar system

386
00:36:31,831 --> 00:36:35,347
and then you considere the
multitude of solar systems out there,

387
00:36:35,448 --> 00:36:39,392
it takes no great leap of imagination to
believe that

388
00:36:39,493 --> 00:36:46,393
life might be a common phenomenon
throughout the universe.

389
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:54,876
Our rovers have gone farther, harder,
and longer than even we, their creators,

390
00:36:54,977 --> 00:36:58,446
believed possible. They've done heroic work.

391
00:36:58,547 --> 00:37:02,802
But some day we won't need robots.

392
00:37:02,903 --> 00:37:09,560
Some day, there'll be humans on the surface
of Mars and boot prints in our wheel tracks.

393
00:37:18,063 --> 00:37:20,801
This mission has put us on
a great trajectory to learn

394
00:37:20,902 --> 00:37:23,686
more about Mars and about ourselves.

395
00:37:23,787 --> 00:37:28,714
But right now, Spirit and Opportunity
are still roving Mars.

396
00:37:28,815 --> 00:37:33,065
It's not just
that they've exceeded our wildest dreams.

397
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:37,045
In many ways, they are our wildest dreams.
