No, you're not married yet? Are you.</font>

37
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,896
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">No.</font>

38

39

<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It was?</font>

40
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:04,206
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Did you make this stew,
Miss Shino?</font>

41
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:08,612
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Yes. With a little help from Kie.</font>

42
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:11,477
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">'A little'! Listen to her!</font>

43
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:12,876
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Mother!</font>

44
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,384
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Kie!</font>

45
00:04:16,489 --> 00:04:19,287
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Who made this cod stew?</font>

46
00:04:19,492 --> 00:04:21,255
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Miss Shino, of course.</font>

47
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:28,192
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">The secret's out.</font>

48
00:04:28,868 --> 00:04:30,665
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Kie made it? Didn't she.</font>

49
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,271
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I sliced the radish!</font>

50
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,868
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Any child could do that.
What'll we do with you!</font>

51
00:04:39,612 --> 00:04:40,476
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">This?</font>

52
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:42,410
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You sliced this?</font>

53
00:04:43,049 --> 00:04:44,516
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Very well done!</font>

54
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:51,857
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You didn't have to say that!
You're horrible!</font>

55
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,953
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Sir, you shouldn't...</font>

56
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,395
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...make fun of her
before Squire Shimada!</font>

57
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:58,121
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Kie!</font>

58
00:04:58,264 --> 00:04:59,822
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You poor thing!</font>

59
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,727
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Yes? You're right.</font>

60
00:05:03,202 --> 00:05:04,692
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'm sorry, Shino.</font>

61
00:05:04,904 --> 00:05:08,499
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Come on, pour Samon a drink!</font>

62
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,835
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Squire Samon...</font>

63
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,409
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...this is a good time to ask.</font>

64
00:05:15,181 --> 00:05:19,345
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Do you really mean
to take this girl to wife?</font>

65
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,543
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Why do you ask?</font>

66
00:05:24,691 --> 00:05:29,856
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">When her father was alive,
our stipend was 100 koku of rice.</font>

67
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:33,866
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That is not so much less than yours.</font>

68
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:41,469
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">But after he had to commit suicide,
we were reduced to 30 koku per year.</font>

69
00:05:43,042 --> 00:05:47,479
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Our prospects for advancement
are not good? Either.</font>

70
00:05:49,415 --> 00:05:54,250
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Are you not worried about
what your family will think...</font>

71
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,719
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...if you marry one of us?</font>

72
00:05:57,857 --> 00:06:03,625
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Don't be concerned.
I will choose who I marry.</font>

73
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:06,398
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That is good to hear.</font>

74
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:10,996
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">There's just one thing
that displeases me.</font>

75
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:12,466
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What?</font>

76
00:06:13,406 --> 00:06:18,343
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You'll be my 'elder brother'.
I don't look forward to that.</font>

77
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:19,578
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Fool!</font>

78
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,840
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It'll go to your head.</font>

79
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:24,043
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Kie? Did you hear that?</font>

80
00:06:24,183 --> 00:06:25,241
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Agh!</font>

81
00:06:25,485 --> 00:06:26,417
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Yes? Sir.</font>

82
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,918
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He's not making sense!</font>

83
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:34,353
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I understand perfectly
how Squire Shimada feels.</font>

84
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,422
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What?!</font>

85
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:37,756
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">See?</font>

86
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,826
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Drink up, 'kid brother'!</font>

87
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:48,632
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Kie watched over my sister, she was married to Smon.</font>

88
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:54,410
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Next it was her turn
to leave us forever...</font>

89
00:06:55,081 --> 00:06:58,346
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...when she married into
merchant family.</font>

90
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:03,716
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It was as if the light
had gone out in our house.</font>

91
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,855
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Kie!</font>

92
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,489
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Hello? Sir!</font>

93
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:49,459
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I thought it was you!</font>

94
00:07:49,836 --> 00:07:50,928
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Are you well?</font>

95
00:07:51,838 --> 00:07:57,708
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'm sorry I couldn't come to
your mother's one-year memorial.</font>

96
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,604
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It was rude of me.</font>

97
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:01,739
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Shopping?</font>

98
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:04,778
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Yes. For cloth and thread.</font>

99
00:08:05,418 --> 00:08:08,751
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Let me buy you
a kimono collar? Then.</font>

100
00:08:09,288 --> 00:08:11,779
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What have you got
that would suit her?</font>

101
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,825
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You've lost weight.</font>

102
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:24,493
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I was in bed with a cold
last month.</font>

103
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:28,437
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That's not good.
Are you better now?</font>

104
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:29,597
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Yes.</font>

105
00:08:33,746 --> 00:08:34,804
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">How's this one?</font>

106
00:08:35,081 --> 00:08:36,912
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">We'll take that? Then.</font>

107
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,846
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Why, thank you!</font>

108
00:08:43,756 --> 00:08:45,189
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'm so pleased...</font>

109
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,188
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Are you happy?</font>

110
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:52,865
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Yes.</font>

111
00:09:01,774 --> 00:09:03,537
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Why are you crying?</font>

112
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:08,674
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'm so happy to see you again...</font>

113
00:09:08,915 --> 00:09:10,849
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...the tears just came.</font>

114
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:14,642
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Is your husband
taking good care of you?</font>

115
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:18,453
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Are you sure?</font>

116
00:09:21,127 --> 00:09:24,619
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'll treasure this collar.</font>

117
00:09:25,698 --> 00:09:26,824
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Excuse me.</font>

118
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:31,026
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Um...</font>

119
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:36,801
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...you're married by now?
Aren't you, sir?</font>

120
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:40,075
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Uh, no...</font>

121
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,573
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...I'm afraid not.</font>

122
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:47,316
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Since Mother died
the house is a mess.</font>

123
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,447
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Perhaps you could come
and do some cleaning.</font>

124
00:09:54,493 --> 00:09:57,018
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I promise I will.</font>

125
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:29,925
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You know, Kume...</font>

126
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,562
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...I saw Kie today.</font>

127
00:10:34,767 --> 00:10:35,927
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Oh.</font>

128
00:10:37,603 --> 00:10:43,542
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I thought she was happily married
into the Iseya family...</font>

129
00:10:45,244 --> 00:10:46,973
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...but today...</font>

00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:53,985
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...she'd grown so pale
and thin in the shoulders...</font>

131
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:58,718
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">She was always
so cheerful and healthy...</font>

132
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:01,284
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Now she looks ill.</font>

133
00:11:01,427 --> 00:11:02,587
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Oh? Dear!</font>

134
00:11:03,996 --> 00:11:07,727
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I asked if she was happy...</font>

135
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,231
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...and she started crying.</font>

136
00:11:14,774 --> 00:11:16,264
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">The poor girl!</font>

137
00:11:23,783 --> 00:11:29,050
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I wanted to help her,
but I didn't know what to do.</font>

138
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:36,253
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Perhaps I should have just
brought her back here with me.</font>

139
00:11:47,306 --> 00:11:52,073
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I've cared for her ever since
she was 16...</font>

140
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:55,914
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...like a younger sister.</font>

141
00:11:58,451 --> 00:12:00,214
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">And now she's...</font>

142
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:30,879
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'm going home? Sir.</font>

143
00:12:31,350 --> 00:12:34,717
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You are? Good night.</font>

144
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:43,688
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I couldn't help but worry about Kie.</font>

145
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:54,266
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I was Iso feeling guilty
bout my inability to understand...</font>

146
00:12:55,841 --> 00:13:02,076
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...the principles
of the new western artillery.</font>

147
00:13:02,882 --> 00:13:05,214
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Now? This is vital.</font>

148
00:13:06,051 --> 00:13:13,014
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Wearing the finger stall? You insert
the right forefinger into the vent.</font>

149
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:17,388
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">This prevents air from being expelled
when the shot is loaded...</font>

150
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:20,631
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...which could be disastrous.</font>

151
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:21,925
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Bang!</font>

152
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:26,199
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">A premature discharge,
causing burns and even death.</font>

153
00:13:27,006 --> 00:13:29,270
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I had a colleague die that way.</font>

154
00:13:30,209 --> 00:13:35,044
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Next occurs the 'ranging' of the gun.
This involves four techniques:</font>

155
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:39,383
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">1: Quadrant. 2: Tangent scale.
3: Breech sight...</font>

156
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:44,148
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...and 4: Pendulum hausse.
You learned these yesterday.</font>

157
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:45,814
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Questions?</font>

158
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,285
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Yes?</font>

159
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:51,487
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">This book says
the English 'Armstrong' cannon...</font>

160
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:56,499
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...has a vent piece, so you don't
have to stick your finger in it.</font>

161
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:58,430
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It costs more.</font>

162
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:05,032
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">One Armstrong costs as much as
500 of your old matchlocks.</font>

163
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:09,314
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Wars now are won by
the most expensive weaponry.</font>

164
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:13,047
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">By money. Such is the age
that is upon us.</font>

165
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:14,174
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Sensei...</font>

166
00:14:14,453 --> 00:14:15,385
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Yes?</font>

167
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,522
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'm sorry, but...</font>

168
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:22,923
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...I haven't the foggiest idea
what you're talking about.</font>

169
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,693
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It'd help if you'd speak
the way we're used to...</font>

170
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:28,925
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He can't!</font>

171
00:14:29,068 --> 00:14:31,935
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Then why get an instructor
from Edo?</font>

172
00:14:32,738 --> 00:14:37,732
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Could you at least translate
all those English and Dutch words?</font>

173
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,904
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">They put my head in a whirl.</font>

174
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,479
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">The longer I sit the stupider I feel!</font>

175
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:49,814
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You find this amusing?</font>

176
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:52,884
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Is this a time for levity?</font>

177
00:14:53,425 --> 00:14:58,453
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">To prepare you to face an emergency
with modern artillery...</font>

178
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:04,427
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...your clan has summoned me
from Edo to this backwater!</font>

179
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:06,665
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">This is no laughing matter!</font>

180
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:12,070
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">With all due respect? Sir...
a 'backwater'?</font>

181
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:17,004
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">We are hereditary vassals
to the Tokugawa shogun.</font>

182
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:21,547
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">At the Battle of Sekigahara
our first chieftain...</font>

183
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:24,555
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I am well aware of that.</font>

184
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:30,061
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I apologize.
We will pause for a moment.</font>

185
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:34,195
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Stupid back-country samurai!</font>

186
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:37,901
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Not that far!</font>

you young oaf!</font>

256
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:11,019
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">'Oaf'? I have a wife.</font>

257
00:22:11,229 --> 00:22:14,756
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It's Munezo here who doesn't.</font>

258
00:22:16,034 --> 00:22:17,501
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It's you?</font>

259
00:22:18,236 --> 00:22:22,570
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What's the connection between
firearms and a wife for me?</font>

260
00:22:22,708 --> 00:22:25,677
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Everything's connected, you fool!</font>

261
00:22:25,811 --> 00:22:26,436
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Feather brain!</font>

262
00:22:26,578 --> 00:22:27,567
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">No-account!</font>

263
00:22:27,746 --> 00:22:28,872
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Disgrace!</font>

264
00:22:29,081 --> 00:22:30,139
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Uncle...</font>

265
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:34,181
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">The refreshments are ready.</font>

266
00:22:38,724 --> 00:22:40,248
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Who are you again?</font>

267
00:22:40,492 --> 00:22:42,517
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Munezo's sister.</font>

268
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,507
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">The tea's ready? 'Father'.</font>

269
00:23:06,151 --> 00:23:08,676
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">They really lit into you?
'Elder Brother'.</font>

270
00:23:09,187 --> 00:23:12,020
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">And you? 'Father'.</font>

271
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:18,826
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I've always hated that man.
He's so full of himself!</font>

272
00:23:21,299 --> 00:23:25,963
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He had no call to talk like that,
spraying spit all over the place...</font>

273
00:23:28,106 --> 00:23:32,338
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It's my own fault
for not finding myself a wife.</font>

274
00:23:32,477 --> 00:23:33,466
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Aye.</font>

275
00:23:36,548 --> 00:23:39,142
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You can't beat me yet, 'Father'.</font>

276
00:23:39,484 --> 00:23:42,681
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Kane? Bring my sewing box.</font>

277
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:45,749
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Brother...</font>

278
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:47,017
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What?</font>

279
00:23:47,292 --> 00:23:52,821
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Your cloak's ripped. I couldn't
take my eyes off it at the ceremony.</font>

280
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:59,231
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Well? They do say
single men breed maggots...</font>

281
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:03,740
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...but still? He's getting
really scruffy.</font>

282
00:24:07,712 --> 00:24:10,738
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He wasn't like that
when Kie was around.</font>

283
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:14,181
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Oh? Kie... how is she?</font>

284
00:24:14,719 --> 00:24:17,187
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'm worried. I think I'll...</font>

285
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:19,813
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Is something wrong with Kie?</font>

286
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,660
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">She's in bed sick.</font>

287
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,395
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">She's sick? Is it bad?</font>

288
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,232
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It looks that way.</font>

289
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:37,340
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">The clerk from the next store
was here, and he told me...</font>

290
00:24:37,509 --> 00:24:41,468
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...that from the day after her wedding
Kie was up before everyone...</font>

291
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:45,241
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...cleaning and cooking
for all the apprentices...</font>

292
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:49,012
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...and bathing last at night
in everyone's grime.</font>

293
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:54,384
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">The clerk said anyone
would get sick that way.</font>

294
00:24:56,561 --> 00:24:59,621
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That's a real shame.</font>

295
00:24:59,764 --> 00:25:04,394
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He said she miscarried last fall
and they gave her no time to rest.</font>

296
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:09,700
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">And now she's ill they won't spend
the money for a doctor.</font>

297
00:25:09,941 --> 00:25:11,841
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That's terrible!</font>

298
00:25:14,212 --> 00:25:17,238
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Her father came to see her.</font>

299
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:22,510
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">They said Kie was of their family now,
and he wasn't to interfere.</font>

300
00:25:22,721 --> 00:25:24,712
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">They turned him away.</font>

301
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,987
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">They re terrible.</font>

302
00:25:31,496 --> 00:25:33,623
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">How long has she been in bed?</font>

303
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:39,698
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">She hasn't been seen in the shop
in two months.</font>

304
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,774
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">If you knew that,
why haven't you been to see her?!</font>

305
00:25:45,977 --> 00:25:49,413
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I couldn't go to a merchant's house!</font>

306
00:25:51,283 --> 00:25:52,580
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Where are you going?</font>

307
00:25:53,652 --> 00:25:58,817
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I've been worried about her
all through the winter.</font>

308
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:00,088
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'll go see her.</font>

309
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,192
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Hey!</font>

310
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:06,358
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'll go? Too.</font>

311
00:26:18,043 --> 00:26:22,002
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Well! What can I do for you?</font>

312
00:26:22,414 --> 00:26:26,680
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Your daughter-in-law once served
in my house. My name is Katagiri.</font>

313
00:26:26,818 --> 00:26:32,620
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Oh? Yes! Kie's told us all about you.</font>

314
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:36,692
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I've heard Kie is ill.
I'm here to see her.</font>

315
00:26:36,828 --> 00:26:39,023
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That's very nice of you.</font>

316
00:26:39,164 --> 00:26:41,394
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Yes? She is ill...</font>

317
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:47,028
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...but I'm looking after her,
so you need have no fear.</font>

318
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:55,078
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Once she's recovered?
I'll have her come and thank you.</font>

319
00:26:56,414 --> 00:26:58,974
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Is she very ill?</font>

320
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,081
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Not seriously.</font>

321
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:04,814
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">A circulatory problem.
It's quite common.</font>

322
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:08,448
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">But I'm told she's been ill
for two months now.</font>

323
00:27:08,693 --> 00:27:10,092
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Has a doctor seen her?</font>

324
00:27:10,228 --> 00:27:14,494
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Of course! Our family doctor
attends to her.</font>

325
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:21,072
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Since I've come all this way?
I'd like to see her once before I go.</font>

326
00:27:21,239 --> 00:27:24,265
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Kie is my son's wife.</font>

327
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:29,170
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I can't have a man visiting her,
former employer or not.</font>

328
00:27:29,314 --> 00:27:31,339
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">The very idea!</font>

329
00:27:31,583 --> 00:27:32,572
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You refuse?</font>

330
00:27:32,751 --> 00:27:36,881
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Yes! I have young people
working here to consider.</font>

331
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,051
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I will see her.</font>

332
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:46,527
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Samurai or not? The answer is 'no'.
Now leave, please.</font>

333
00:27:46,765 --> 00:27:49,461
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'll see her whether you like it or not!</font>

334
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:52,934
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Shall I call the Constable?</font>

335
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:55,433
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Where is Kie? Take me to her!</font>

336
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,338
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Hey!</font>

337
00:28:13,892 --> 00:28:17,157
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">She's no use to us anyway!</font>

338
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:20,294
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">This room's freezing!</font>

339
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,794
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Kie...</font>

340
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,571
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...do you recognize me?</font>

341
00:28:32,143 --> 00:28:33,440
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Your house...</font>

342
00:28:36,247 --> 00:28:41,981
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I didn't come to clean your house.
Forgive me.</font>

343
00:28:43,755 --> 00:28:44,847
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I do.</font>

344
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,920
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I was so busy...</font>

345
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,161
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...all through New Year's...</font>

346
00:28:53,531 --> 00:28:55,396
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Then I got sick...</font>

347
00:28:57,736 --> 00:29:00,136
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...and I couldn't get up.</font>

348
00:29:01,406 --> 00:29:02,532
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">No?</font>

349
00:29:07,312 --> 00:29:13,376
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'm afraid if I go on like this
I'm going to die.</font>

350
00:29:17,655 --> 00:29:18,986
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">But...</font>

351
00:29:19,557 --> 00:29:24,824
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...I wanted to see you first, sir...</font>

352
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:29,160
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...and apologize.</font>

353
00:29:31,970 --> 00:29:35,906
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That's fine. You can
tell me all about it later.</font>

354
00:29:37,509 --> 00:29:40,171
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Let's go.</font>

355
00:29:40,879 --> 00:29:42,176
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Come with me.</font>

356
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:47,309
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What did you say?</font>

357
00:29:48,987 --> 00:29:53,287
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'm ashamed... to be seen like this.</font>

358
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:57,319
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Don't be.</font>

359
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:01,659
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It's that old witch's fault
this happened.</font>

360
00:30:07,772 --> 00:30:09,501
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'm taking Kie.</font>

361
00:30:10,008 --> 00:30:13,944
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Write a statement of divorce.
I'll come for it later.</font>

362
00:30:15,413 --> 00:30:17,574
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You're in the way! Move!</font>

363
00:30:19,117 --> 00:30:23,281
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">All right? Kie... hold on tight.</font>

364
00:30:25,023 --> 00:30:27,821
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Hold onto me.</font>

365
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,191
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">She's ours! Where are you taking her?</font>

366
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:36,330
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You listen to me!</font>

367
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:41,232
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Kie trained as a maid with us
for three and a half years.</font>

368
00:30:42,106 --> 00:30:44,267
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">From my late mother...</font>

369
00:30:44,642 --> 00:30:47,440
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...she learned housework
and deportment...</font>

370
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:51,476
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...so she could go proudly
as a bride into any house.</font>

371
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:57,612
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It enrages me to see her...</font>

372
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:02,456
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...in a pitiful state like this!</font>

373
00:31:04,262 --> 00:31:06,492
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">File a complaint if you wish.</font>

374
00:31:08,766 --> 00:31:12,725
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'll protect her
if it takes my sword to do it!</font>

375
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,974
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Milksop!</font>

376
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:33,113
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">The basket, Naota!</font>

377
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,486
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What are you doing?</font>

378
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:38,459
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">The chicken got away!</font>

379
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,000
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Shino! I'm glad you came.</font>

380
00:31:44,369 --> 00:31:47,463
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Naota told me everything.
Where is she?</font>

381
00:31:47,672 --> 00:31:49,435
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">In the back room.</font>

382
00:31:50,141 --> 00:31:51,733
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What did the doctor say?</font>

383
00:31:52,010 --> 00:31:54,843
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That she's weak,
but not badly ill.</font>

384
00:31:55,013 --> 00:31:56,173
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Really?</font>

385
00:31:56,681 --> 00:32:00,208
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He says with food and rest
she'll be fine.</font>

386
00:32:09,427 --> 00:32:10,553
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Kie...</font>

387
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,125
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...it's me.</font>

388
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,899
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Do you recognize me?</font>

389
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:25,200
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You poor thing! You're so thin!</font>

390
00:32:25,743 --> 00:32:28,610
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">We should have come sooner!</font>

391
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:32,280
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">No, don't get up.</font>

392
00:32:33,518 --> 00:32:35,816
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Just lay back and rest.</font>

393
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:43,725
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'll wipe her down.
Heat some water.</font>

394
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:45,488
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I already am.</font>

395
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:49,424
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'll get her one of Mother's robes.
Where are they?</font>

396
00:32:49,567 --> 00:32:51,296
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'll do it.</font>

397
00:32:51,436 --> 00:32:52,425
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Shino!</font>

398
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:56,006
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I thought we could make her
some chicken broth.</font>

399
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,107
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Get busy!</font>

400
00:32:57,241 --> 00:33:00,768
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You can't feed her anything
as oily as that now!</font>

401
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,539
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Make some rice gruel.</font>

402
00:33:03,748 --> 00:33:06,512
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">How do you make that?</font>

403
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,516
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Boil a little rice in water.</font>

404
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:10,450
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Kane? You do it.</font>

405
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:13,522
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Munezo? Heat me some water!</font>

406
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:14,715
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Oh? Yeah...</font>

407
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:21,360
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Kume! Go somewhere
out of the way!</font>

408
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:22,625
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What can I do?</font>

409
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:24,632
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You're in the way, too.</font>

410
00:33:27,338 --> 00:33:29,135
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What are you doing?!</font>

411
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:36,308
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'll do it.</font>

412
00:33:36,881 --> 00:33:38,576
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Don't let go!</font>

413
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:53,494
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Kume? look in on Kie
before you go to bed.</font>

414
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:58,558
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'll come back tomorrow.</font>

415
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:01,828
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Sorry to keep you here this late.</font>

416
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:10,206
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What's going to come of this?</font>

417
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:14,749
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">A samurai carrying
a girl on his back...</font>

418
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,913
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...in broad daylight!</font>

419
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,752
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">People will talk.</font>

420
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:32,135
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Here? Kie. This'll warm your feet.</font>

421
00:34:38,676 --> 00:34:42,635
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Tomorrow I'll go back
to the Iseya...</font>

422
00:34:43,014 --> 00:34:44,879
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...and settle everything.</font>

423
00:34:46,317 --> 00:34:50,344
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">There's nothing to worry about.
You just rest here.</font>

424
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:54,953
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Think of this as your own home.</font>

425
00:34:55,426 --> 00:34:56,825
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">All right?</font>

426
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:27,851
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Hello...</font>

427
00:36:29,487 --> 00:36:30,476
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Hello!</font>

428
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:35,190
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Is this Squire Katagiri's house?</font>

429
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:42,792
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'm Kie's sister. I've come to see her.</font>

430
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:54,708
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Good day to you.</font>

431
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,107
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">In there.</font>

432
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:06,114
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Sis?</font>

433
00:37:10,161 --> 00:37:11,423
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Bun!</font>

434
00:37:14,031 --> 00:37:18,058
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Pa said come see you.</font>

435
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:24,864
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You came all that way?
And by yourself!</font>

436
00:37:25,543 --> 00:37:29,104
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'm so glad you're all right!</font>

437
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:33,147
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I was so worried!</font>

438
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:37,536
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Who are you?
What are you doing here?</font>

439
00:38:42,253 --> 00:38:45,188
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">No, that's not necessary.</font>

440
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:48,350
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Who are you, child?</font>

441
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:06,136
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Do I seem such an ogre, then?</font>

442
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:08,978
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That's a surprise to me.</font>

443
00:39:09,413 --> 00:39:13,008
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It's not that you're an ogre? Sir.</font>

444
00:39:13,217 --> 00:39:15,742
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Samurai scare her.</font>

445
00:39:15,953 --> 00:39:20,481
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">She's never seen one
up close before.</font>

446
00:39:21,258 --> 00:39:23,089
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Why do we scare her?</font>

447
00:39:23,227 --> 00:39:26,458
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Because you carry swords.</font>

448
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:30,666
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I grew up thinking
that if I offended a samurai...</font>

449
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:34,099
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...he'd cut me down
right there on the spot.</font>

450
00:39:34,739 --> 00:39:36,730
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That's just not so? Kie.</font>

451
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:42,244
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">A sword is something
you hardly ever draw.</font>

452
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:46,615
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I've never drawn mine
except to tend to it.</font>

453
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:50,449
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Is that the truth, sir?</font>

454
00:39:50,755 --> 00:39:52,222
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Of course!</font>

455
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:57,757
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Killing is frightening,
even for a samurai.</font>

456
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:01,525
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That's something
I've never heard before.</font>

457
00:40:01,999 --> 00:40:06,868
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">So were you afraid of me
when you first came here?</font>

458
00:40:07,037 --> 00:40:12,339
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">My heart was pounding, sir.
I thought I might die any moment.</font>

459
00:40:13,611 --> 00:40:18,207
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Is that really what you thought?</font>

460
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,881
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">And here my heart was pounding...</font>

461
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:25,180
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...over this young girl
who'd come to our house.</font>

462
00:40:27,558 --> 00:40:28,889
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Is something wrong?</font>

463
00:40:30,261 --> 00:40:32,286
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'm fooling with you, sir.</font>

464
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:35,790
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Well? Of all the nerve!</font>

465
00:40:36,066 --> 00:40:39,661
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Making fun of me!
Can you imagine that? Naota?</font>

466
00:40:44,008 --> 00:40:46,374
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Now? That's a big mouth!</font>

467
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:58,980
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">See, Bun? Your sister's laughing.</font>

468
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:07,796
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Watch your head!</font>

469
00:41:13,037 --> 00:41:14,197
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Naota!</font>

470
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,909
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">No sleeping late tomorrow, now.</font>

471
00:41:22,346 --> 00:41:27,716
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You've got to grow up right
and make a good wife of yourself.</font>

472
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:32,247
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Will you go as a bride again?</font>

473
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:35,788
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">No. I've learned my lesson.</font>

474
00:41:36,427 --> 00:41:40,227
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">When I'm better,
I'll just look after the master.</font>

475
00:41:40,664 --> 00:41:42,825
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I owe him my life, after all.</font>

476
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:46,997
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Will you marry the master? Then?</font>

477
00:41:47,738 --> 00:41:52,641
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">No. The master and I
are of different castes.</font>

478
00:41:53,043 --> 00:41:54,772
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Different what?</font>

479
00:41:55,112 --> 00:41:56,340
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">'Castes'.</font>

480
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:59,608
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What does that mean?</font>

481
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:03,812
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I don't really know.</font>

482
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:08,353
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I've never thought about it before.</font>

483
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:16,823
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Hello!</font>

484
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,236
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Hello!</font>

485
00:42:20,638 --> 00:42:21,935
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Who's there?</font>

486
00:42:26,911 --> 00:42:27,935
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Who is it?</font>

487
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:31,508
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It's me? Samon.</font>

488
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,451
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">There's trouble.</font>

489
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:53,629
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Hazama's been sent down
from Edo for plotting rebellion.</font>

490
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:56,672
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He'll be caged here in the domain.</font>

491
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:00,974
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Hazama? Caged?</font>

492
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:09,916
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He was involved with some reformers
inside the Shogunate.</font>

493
00:43:10,487 --> 00:43:13,081
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Senior Retainer Hori found out.</font>

494
00:43:16,961 --> 00:43:22,422
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Some got off with har-kiri,
but Hazama wasn't so lucky.</font>

495
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:25,001
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He's on the Ou Highway now...</font>

496
00:43:25,836 --> 00:43:30,205
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...being brought here
in a prisoner's basket.</font>

497
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:32,173
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">When does he arrive?</font>

498
00:43:33,243 --> 00:43:34,733
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">In two days.</font>

499
00:43:35,312 --> 00:43:36,643
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Who told you?</font>

500
00:43:37,514 --> 00:43:38,742
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">My father.</font>

501
00:43:40,084 --> 00:43:43,918
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It's all being kept
very secret.</font>

502
00:43:44,888 --> 00:43:47,982
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Anyone who talks
is guilty of an offence.</font>

503
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:54,094
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">My father knows
we were friends with Hazama...</font>

504
00:43:54,665 --> 00:43:56,656
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...so he warned me.</font>

505
00:44:00,771 --> 00:44:03,797
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I was afraid
he'd get into trouble down there...</font>

506
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:09,272
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...but I never thought he'd come home

512
00:45:31,128 --> 00:45:32,152
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">On your feet!</font>

513

<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Let's go.</font>

516
00:46:18,142 --> 00:46:20,269
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Is Squire Katagiri here?</font>

517
00:46:20,844 --> 00:46:22,436
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Katagiri!</font>

518
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:32,811
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You're to report to
the Head Overseer for questioning.</font>

519
00:46:37,494 --> 00:46:39,587
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">The Head Overseer's here?</font>

520
00:46:40,063 --> 00:46:43,055
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He arrived by swift-palanquin
from Edo yesterday.</font>

521
00:47:02,586 --> 00:47:04,986
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">This must be about Hazama.</font>

522
00:47:06,089 --> 00:47:09,547
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What does Squire Katagiri
have to do with him?</font>

523
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:11,285
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You don't know?</font>

524
00:47:11,862 --> 00:47:17,300
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He and Hazama studied fencing
under Master Toda.</font>

525
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:18,924
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">They were an even match.</font>

526
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:22,004
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">So is Squire Katagiri
mixed up in this plot?</font>

527
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:27,304
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Shh! Don't talk about that!
You'll lose your head if you do!</font>

528
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:31,004
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">The head came off!</font>

529
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:04,138

of our Training Corps.</font>

<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Kansai Toda. Under our late Lord
he surrendered samurai status...</font>

537
00:48:34,444 --> 00:48:35,843
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...and became a farmer.</font>

538

<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">May I enquire...</font>

542
00:48:51,094 --> 00:48:54,086
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...of what crime
Hazama stands accused?</font>

543
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:57,597
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Silence! You will answer
the questions you are asked!</font>

544
00:48:57,935 --> 00:49:00,733
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Such impertinence
to the Head Overseer!</font>

545
00:49:02,673 --> 00:49:07,042
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">'Katagiri'... the son of
Hanbei Katagiri?</font>

over the Goken River improvements.</font>

547
00:49:11,648 --> 00:49:14,173
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He has his father's insolence.</font>

<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I am told Hazama left in anger

You or Hazama?</font>

557

<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Hazama, I would think.</font>

558
00:49:57,127 --> 00:49:58,822
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That's strange...</font>

559
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:04,729
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You competed before His Lordship
some years ago, and of three matches...</font>

<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...you won two.</font>

561
00:50:06,036 --> 00:50:10,439
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Had we fought with real swords,
Hazama would have won.</font>

562
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:16,710
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">All right? Then.</font>

563
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:22,817
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Have you received letters from him
since he left three years ago?</font>

564
00:50:24,054 --> 00:50:28,753
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Two or three times,
New Year's greetings and the like.</font>

is Hazama close to?</font>

568
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:55,277
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You must know that.</font>

569
00:50:59,589 --> 00:51:04,492
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">This is a list of those
who have studied under Master Toda.</font>

570
00:51:05,896 --> 00:51:09,525
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Your name is among them.</font>

571
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:14,131
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Tell us who else here
is friendly with Hazama.</font>

572

<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I wouldn't know.</font>

573
00:51:21,745 --> 00:51:25,977
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">And even if I did know...</font>

574
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:28,709
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...I could not say.</font>

575
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:32,647

576
00:51:35,158 --> 00:51:40,721
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">A samurai does not inform
on his fellows.</font>

578
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:54,437
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">This is important! I won't take this
from a low-caste samurai!</font>

579
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:57,372
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Remember to whom you speak!</font>

580
00:52:01,818 --> 00:52:03,012
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You insolent cur!</font>

581
00:52:21,905 --> 00:52:24,203
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Squire Hazama? Time to eat.</font>

582
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:35,710
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Squire?</font>

583
00:53:19,062 --> 00:53:20,757
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Welcome home, sir.</font>

584
00:53:21,331 --> 00:53:24,562
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Mother didn't teach you
how to chop wood? Did she.</font>

585
00:53:24,701 --> 00:53:26,601
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'm just not strong enough.</font>

586
00:53:27,103 --> 00:53:32,302
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Spread your knees and hold the wood
straight in front of you.</font>

587
00:53:33,476 --> 00:53:36,070
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Don't lift the wood into the air.</font>

588
00:53:36,513 --> 00:53:39,676
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Lift the axe, take aim...</font>

589
00:53:39,816 --> 00:53:40,908
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...and bring it down.</font>

590
00:53:42,319 --> 00:53:47,780
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Hold the axe loosely?
Then put your weight behind it.</font>

591
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:50,487
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Can you do that?</font>

592
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:51,961
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Yes? Sir.</font>

593
00:53:54,831 --> 00:53:56,765
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">How was your work today?</font>

594
00:53:59,502 --> 00:54:01,231
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Why do you ask?</font>

595
00:54:02,138 --> 00:54:07,474
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You're so pale I thought perhaps
something made you angry.</font>

596
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,679
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Those things happen every day.</font>

597
00:54:12,515 --> 00:54:16,042
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">One must bear them
like a samurai.</font>

598
00:54:18,888 --> 00:54:19,946
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Um...</font>

599
00:54:21,524 --> 00:54:22,388
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...here.</font>

600
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:24,318
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Thank you!</font>

601
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:36,502
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">But because one is a samurai
there are things one must not bear!</font>

602
00:54:49,419 --> 00:54:52,286
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Excuse me... I've brought tea.</font>

603
00:54:57,060 --> 00:55:00,996
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I hate to interrupt your studies,
but could I ask you to stand up?</font>

604
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:02,328
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Why?</font>

605
00:55:02,866 --> 00:55:06,495
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'd like to see how this kimono
of your father's fits you.</font>

606
00:55:06,836 --> 00:55:10,363
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Your mother often said
how it would suit you...</font>

607
00:55:10,607 --> 00:55:13,735
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...and that she was going
to adjust it for you.</font>

608
00:55:22,185 --> 00:55:26,519
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Why, it's perfect!
The sleeves and the length.</font>

609
00:55:26,756 --> 00:55:29,020
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You could wear it just like that? Sir.</font>

610
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:33,220
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I guess I have
my father's build.</font>

611
00:55:33,496 --> 00:55:36,897
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Do you resemble him
in the face? Too?</font>

612
00:55:37,133 --> 00:55:39,328
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">No, not at all.</font>

613
00:55:39,969 --> 00:55:43,063
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">My father had a face
like a crab.</font>

614
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:46,198
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">When he got mad? The spit would fly.</font>

615
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:48,967
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Nothing ever scared me like that.</font>

616
00:55:50,313 --> 00:55:52,907
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">If he were alive? He'd be 60 now.</font>

617
00:55:55,251 --> 00:55:58,311
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You've heard what happened?
Haven't you?</font>

618
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:00,720
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Yes...</font>

619
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:06,592
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Father!</font>

620
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:14,464
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">There was a problem with the accounts
for the Goken River bridge.</font>

621
00:56:15,905 --> 00:56:20,808
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">My father took responsibility,
and committed suicide.</font>

622
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:34,881
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He left me a letter.</font>

623
00:56:36,059 --> 00:56:37,788
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">'I have not sinned...</font>

627
00:56:50,707 --> 00:56:52,902
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It's a very sad thing.</font>

628
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:59,807
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">We were driven out of
the big house we'd lived in...</font>

629

<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...the very next day...</font>

630
00:57:03,620 --> 00:57:05,212

nothing to do with us.</font>

632
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:17,128
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Those were wretched days for
my mother, Shino and me.</font>

633
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:22,265
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Then you came along?
A ruddy-faced girl...</font>

634
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:24,874
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...fresh off the farm.</font>

635
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:30,978
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I didn't know how to behave,
or how to speak properly...</font>

636
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:37,584
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Mother certainly took a shine to you.
She said you were brighter than Shino.</font>

637
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:43,015
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">She taught me everything I know.</font>

638
00:57:43,893 --> 00:57:48,296
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">How to clean, lay up preserves,
make miso...</font>

639
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:50,895
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...how to cook? Sew...</font>

640
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:54,128
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...weave, grow flowers...</font>

641
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:56,939
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...calligraphy, poetry...</font>

642
00:57:58,007 --> 00:57:59,998
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">She taught you poems?</font>

643
00:58:01,244 --> 00:58:04,975
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">She spelled them out
so I could practice them.</font>

644
00:58:05,215 --> 00:58:06,705
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What poems?</font>

645
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:08,044
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Different ones.</font>

646
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:11,182
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Chant one for me.</font>

647
00:58:11,788 --> 00:58:13,016
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Oh? I couldn't!</font>

648
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:16,287
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Your master commands it.</font>

649
00:58:19,562 --> 00:58:22,030
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Well? All right.</font>

650
00:58:24,801 --> 00:58:29,534
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">'Methinks you hunt by morn...</font>

651
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:35,604
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">'Methinks you ride now to the hunt...</font>

652
00:58:36,613 --> 00:58:41,880
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">'The sound of your catalpa wood bow...</font>

653
00:58:42,385 --> 00:58:44,717
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">'... comes to me... '</font>

654
00:58:48,825 --> 00:58:51,123
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You have a beautiful voice.</font>

655
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:53,790
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Keep singing!</font>

656
00:58:53,930 --> 00:58:55,261
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">No!</font>

657
00:58:55,498 --> 00:58:57,693
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Even if your master asks?</font>

658
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:00,733
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">All right.</font>

659
00:59:03,106 --> 00:59:08,567
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">'You who rules this land...</font>

660
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:11,438
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">'By morn...</font>

664
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:28,255
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Kume! Kume! Go take your bath.</font>

665
00:59:29,966 --> 00:59:33,060
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">'I hear the sound...</font>

666
00:59:34,103 --> 00:59:36,435

668
00:59:41,311 --> 00:59:42,573
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Once again!</font>

669
00:59:44,247 --> 00:59:46,477
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Eyes...</font>

670
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:48,208
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...left!</font>

671
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:53,783
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">As you were!</font>

672
00:59:57,794 --> 01:00:01,662
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Why can you not move
'click-click! ' on my order?</font>

673
01:00:02,966 --> 01:00:05,992
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">If you retainers cannot...</font>

674
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:09,432
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...however will you instruct
the foot soldiers?</font>

675
01:00:09,872 --> 01:00:14,935
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Sensei, why do we have to move
'click-click! ' like that?</font>

676
01:00:17,313 --> 01:00:18,746
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">As I have explained...</font>

677
01:00:19,015 --> 01:00:22,678
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...before a gun crew is instructed
in artillery...</font>

678
01:00:22,819 --> 01:00:26,016
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...it must learn to respond
'click-click! ' to orders.</font>

679
01:00:26,155 --> 01:00:28,589
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That is the reason for this drill.</font>

680
01:00:29,325 --> 01:00:31,555
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">We will move on to marching.</font>

681
01:00:35,298 --> 01:00:38,665
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Front rank? Forward, march!</font>

682
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:43,164
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">No, no, no, no!</font>

683
01:00:44,907 --> 01:00:48,673
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Left foot forward?
Then swing the opposite arm!</font>

684
01:00:48,811 --> 01:00:49,743
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Like so!</font>

685
01:00:53,116 --> 01:00:55,880
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What's so funny? What?!</font>

686
01:00:56,219 --> 01:00:59,347
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">This is the new
English style of walking!</font>

687
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:00,982
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Now you try it.</font>

688
01:01:02,592 --> 01:01:05,561
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Front rank? Forward, march!</font>

689
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:13,593
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Squire Katagiri! Swing your right arm
as you raise your left foot.</font>

690
01:01:13,736 --> 01:01:16,500
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Why can't you people do this?!</font>

691
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:17,105
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Right!</font>

692
01:01:17,273 --> 01:01:17,864
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Left!</font>

693
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:18,473
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Right!</font>

694
01:01:18,641 --> 01:01:19,369
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Left!</font>

695
01:01:25,748 --> 01:01:27,716
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Don't make me say this again!</font>

696
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:33,784
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Swing your arms, and you will
naturally run much faster.</font>

697
01:01:34,123 --> 01:01:37,320
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You first five? On my order,
please run.</font>

698
01:01:37,794 --> 01:01:38,886
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Ready...</font>

699
01:01:39,862 --> 01:01:40,886
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Run!</font>

700
01:01:48,171 --> 01:01:50,799
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What's wrong with that? Sensei?</font>

701
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:55,872
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You'll get shot
if you don't run faster than that!</font>

702
01:01:56,112 --> 01:02:00,208
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I thought we were running
pretty fast...</font>

703
01:02:01,484 --> 01:02:06,148
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">All right? We'll compare.
We'll have a race.</font>

704
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:07,614
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You're on!</font>

705
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:13,488
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You run in your old samurai style?
And I will run in the new English way.</font>

706
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:15,055
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Go get 'em!</font>

707
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:17,733
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Ready?</font>

708
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:20,000
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Run!</font>

709
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,006
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Faster!</font>

710
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,172
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Go!</font>

711
01:02:25,842 --> 01:02:26,672
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Quick!</font>

712
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:36,140
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Go on! Go!</font>

713
01:02:37,587 --> 01:02:40,750
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Squire Hirota? Are you all right?!</font>

714
01:02:46,162 --> 01:02:47,459
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Where's the Sensei?</font>

715
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:50,589
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He's tired. He's laying down
in his room.</font>

716
01:02:51,934 --> 01:02:56,667
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I feel sorry for him, you know.
An instructor from Edo...</font>

717
01:02:57,106 --> 01:03:01,099
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...up here shouting at
us bumpkins all day...</font>

718
01:03:02,278 --> 01:03:06,647
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">We should take him into
Mugiyamachi for a drink.</font>

719
01:03:06,849 --> 01:03:09,977
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Good idea! We'll set him up
with a girl.</font>

720
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:13,878
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Through for the day?</font>

721
01:03:14,423 --> 01:03:15,253
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Aye.</font>

722
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:26,131
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Well? I'll be on my way.</font>

723
01:03:26,869 --> 01:03:28,427
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Leaving already?</font>

724
01:03:30,706 --> 01:03:36,667
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Katagiri's not very sociable lately.
Always rushing off home.</font>

725
01:03:36,913 --> 01:03:39,973
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He's got a sweet little maid
waiting there for him.</font>

726
01:03:40,116 --> 01:03:41,242
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That's right.</font>

727
01:03:41,450 --> 01:03:44,078
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">The lucky dog!</font>

728
01:03:45,021 --> 01:03:49,754
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Left foot, right arm!
Een, twee! Halt!</font>

729
01:03:51,661 --> 01:03:52,787
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">About turn!</font>

730
01:03:57,366 --> 01:03:58,663
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Forward, march!</font>

731
01:04:01,571 --> 01:04:03,004
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Not like that!</font>

732
01:04:05,241 --> 01:04:06,708
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">So what's on your mind?</font>

733
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:13,175
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Captain Takamine called me
to his house the other day.</font>

734
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:17,010
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He's looking for a husband
for his youngest girl...</font>

735
01:04:17,253 --> 01:04:20,279
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...and asked if I might know
of anyone.</font>

736
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:22,882
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I suggested you.</font>

737
01:04:23,926 --> 01:04:28,625
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I've met her twice.
She's a nice girl.</font>

738
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:32,501
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">No, thanks. I don't need
the trouble.</font>

739
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:35,031
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'm fine as I am.</font>

740
01:04:35,171 --> 01:04:36,195
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Fool!</font>

741
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:42,140
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You don't have to say no.
He already did.</font>

742
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:44,079
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">And that's not all.</font>

743
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:50,046
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He gave me hell for my effrontery
in suggesting you...</font>

744
01:04:50,686 --> 01:04:53,450
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...as a husband
for his precious daughter.</font>

745
01:04:53,856 --> 01:04:55,756
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Why did he do that?</font>

746
01:04:57,059 --> 01:04:59,755
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Don't you understand?</font>

747
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:08,598
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Your father had to commit suicide.</font>

748
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:14,901
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">His son took the young Iseya wife?
And keeps her like a mistress.</font>

749
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:18,004
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">My father did nothing wrong!</font>

750
01:05:18,147 --> 01:05:21,708
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">And there are many
who sympathized with him.</font>

751
01:05:23,219 --> 01:05:24,777
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">But what about Kie?</font>

752
01:05:25,855 --> 01:05:31,316
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It's caused talk among the retainers.
My parents take it out on Shino.</font>

753
01:05:33,062 --> 01:05:35,622
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">She was in tears last night.</font>

754
01:05:38,668 --> 01:05:40,135
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">The poor thing...</font>

755
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:47,806
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I speak as your friend...
do something about Kie.</font>

756
01:05:49,378 --> 01:05:50,868
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Do what?</font>

757
01:05:52,014 --> 01:05:53,481
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That's up to you.</font>

758
01:05:55,785 --> 01:05:58,948
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">But things can't go on as they are.</font>

759
01:05:59,722 --> 01:06:01,849
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I have to hear this from you, too?</font>

760
01:06:03,693 --> 01:06:09,359
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">There is nothing to provoke scandal
between Kie and me.</font>

761
01:06:10,132 --> 01:06:14,535
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">She is a kind
and good-natured girl.</font>

762
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:17,466
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I know that very well!</font>

763
01:06:18,507 --> 01:06:20,873
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That's why I'm telling you this!</font>

764
01:06:23,512 --> 01:06:25,810
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You won't listen to sense!</font>

765
01:06:40,730 --> 01:06:42,664
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Have you ever seen the sea?</font>

766
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:44,054
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">No.</font>

767
01:06:44,467 --> 01:06:49,803
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I've dreamed about seeing it
all my life.</font>

768
01:06:51,640 --> 01:06:53,471
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'm off-duty tomorrow.</font>

769
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:56,876
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Shall we take a lunch and go?</font>

770
01:06:57,980 --> 01:06:59,140
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Really?</font>

771
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:01,906
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You'll really take me to the sea?</font>

772
01:07:02,051 --> 01:07:02,949
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Yes.</font>

773
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:08,820
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'm so glad!</font>

774
01:08:35,167 --> 01:08:39,365
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It's getting to be a while now
since you came back.</font>

775
01:08:42,507 --> 01:08:45,237
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You're healthy again.</font>

776
01:08:46,778 --> 01:08:49,008
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It's about time you went home...</font>

777
01:08:50,916 --> 01:08:52,713
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...to your parents.</font>

778
01:08:56,755 --> 01:09:02,853
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I've been happy to take advantage
of having you with me...</font>

779
01:09:04,029 --> 01:09:08,466
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...what with you knowing
our house so well...</font>

780
01:09:10,569 --> 01:09:13,402
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...but that can't go on forever.</font>

781
01:09:14,906 --> 01:09:19,070
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Being with you,
and taking care of you...</font>

782
01:09:19,311 --> 01:09:21,279
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...suits me very well? Sir.</font>

783
01:09:22,013 --> 01:09:24,208
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Can we not go on as we are?</font>

784
01:09:24,649 --> 01:09:27,675
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">No. We can't do that.</font>

785
01:09:28,486 --> 01:09:30,113
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Why not?</font>

786
01:09:32,290 --> 01:09:37,318
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You are young? Bright?
Good-natured and beautiful.</font>

787
01:09:38,563 --> 01:09:42,260
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You need to find a hard-working man
who will cherish you...</font>

788
01:09:43,301 --> 01:09:45,394
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...have children, and be happy.</font>

789
01:09:47,305 --> 01:09:51,571
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I've no intention
of marrying again.</font>

790
01:09:52,811 --> 01:09:54,335
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I've learned my lesson.</font>

791
01:09:55,180 --> 01:09:58,911
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Rather than suffer that again...</font>

792
01:09:59,050 --> 01:10:02,508
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...I'd much rather sit watching you...</font>

793
01:10:02,988 --> 01:10:07,015
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...eating the food I've made you
with a hearty appetite...</font>

794
01:10:07,225 --> 01:10:09,193
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...and studying late into the night.</font>

795
01:10:10,362 --> 01:10:14,128
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">If that doesn't please you...</font>

796
01:10:15,000 --> 01:10:16,558
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I don't say that.</font>

797
01:10:16,901 --> 01:10:21,031
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Then would you allow me
to stay with you...</font>

798
01:10:21,172 --> 01:10:23,072
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...until you find a wife?</font>

799
01:10:23,308 --> 01:10:25,503
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I don't know when that will be.</font>

800
01:10:25,644 --> 01:10:27,407
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That's fine by me.</font>

801
01:10:28,747 --> 01:10:31,272
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You have your own life to live!</font>

802
01:10:32,384 --> 01:10:34,648
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You can't waste it as my maid!</font>

803
01:10:39,524 --> 01:10:40,923
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">So Kie...</font>

804
01:10:43,161 --> 01:10:44,651
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...go home.</font>

805
01:10:53,371 --> 01:10:54,838
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Is that...</font>

806
01:10:57,075 --> 01:11:00,511
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...what you wish, sir?</font>

807
01:11:04,215 --> 01:11:07,673
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Yes. That is my command.</font>

808
01:11:15,994 --> 01:11:17,621
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">All right.</font>

809
01:11:20,165 --> 01:11:25,034
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Then I have no choice
but to obey.</font>

810
01:11:40,952 --> 01:11:46,049
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Thank you very much
for all you have done for me.</font>

811
01:11:55,200 --> 01:11:56,428
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Got one!</font>

812
01:12:00,872 --> 01:12:02,066
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You did?</font>

813
01:12:11,082 --> 01:12:14,745
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">A Manual of Infantry Training</font>

814
01:12:15,854 --> 01:12:17,788
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Kume? Could you come here?</font>

815
01:12:19,391 --> 01:12:24,522
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Now? The unlined summer kimonos
are in the top drawer of the chest...</font>

816
01:12:24,896 --> 01:12:28,855
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...and the winter ones
are in the bottom drawer.</font>

817
01:12:29,334 --> 01:12:31,268
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Socks are down here.</font>

818
01:12:34,906 --> 01:12:37,898
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Every so often make sure...</font>

819
01:12:38,109 --> 01:12:40,168
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...to look at his socks.</font>

820
01:12:40,678 --> 01:12:43,476
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">There might be holes in them?
And he won't care.</font>

821
01:12:45,483 --> 01:12:49,249
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Don't forget to turn the preserves
so the rice-bran doesn't go off.</font>

822
01:12:49,521 --> 01:12:51,580
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It'll be rainy season soon.</font>

823
01:12:52,457 --> 01:12:54,550
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Turn the tatmi mats.</font>

824
01:12:57,929 --> 01:13:01,365
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">And always watch the fire.</font>

825
01:13:03,134 --> 01:13:05,364
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Don't burn the place down.</font>

826
01:13:09,340 --> 01:13:14,107
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'd meant to take Kie back
to her parents home...</font>

827
01:13:15,313 --> 01:13:18,077
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...but when I got up
the next morning...</font>

828
01:13:18,950 --> 01:13:22,716
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...she hd gone wy
on her own.</font>

829
01:13:29,961 --> 01:13:33,988
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Squire Hazama? Time to eat.</font>

830
01:13:49,347 --> 01:13:50,541
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Squire?</font>

831
01:13:57,255 --> 01:13:58,722
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Is he dead?</font>

832
01:14:06,297 --> 01:14:07,491
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Squire?</font>

833
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:15,503
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Give me the key or
I'll break your arm!</font>

834
01:14:16,274 --> 01:14:17,901
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">All right!</font>

835
01:14:29,187 --> 01:14:30,620
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Killer on the loose!</font>

836
01:14:59,584 --> 01:15:00,881
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Halt!</font>

837
01:15:12,730 --> 01:15:13,662
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Assistance!</font>

838
01:15:16,634 --> 01:15:18,261
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Assistance!</font>

839
01:15:21,906 --> 01:15:22,838
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What?</font>

840
01:15:26,978 --> 01:15:28,172
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He's dead!</font>

841
01:15:28,379 --> 01:15:30,279
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Take his feet!</font>

842
01:15:49,667 --> 01:15:51,692
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Squire Katagiri is here.</font>

843
01:15:59,344 --> 01:16:05,180
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Something serious has happened.
Yaichiro Hazama has escaped.</font>

844
01:16:06,517 --> 01:16:11,181
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">As you know, he is very skilled,
and crafty as any snake.</font>

845
01:16:11,489 --> 01:16:15,823
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He has barricaded himself
in a peasant family's hut...</font>

846
01:16:16,094 --> 01:16:18,062
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...and is holding them hostage.</font>

847
01:16:19,664 --> 01:16:23,862
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Behind him is a range
of very high mountains.</font>

848
01:16:24,535 --> 01:16:27,766
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It's impossible for him
to flee across them...</font>

849
01:16:28,539 --> 01:16:30,439
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...and he doesn't mean to try.</font>

850
01:16:30,575 --> 01:16:33,544
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">We know this because
he had the guard...</font>

851
01:16:35,113 --> 01:16:38,844
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...bring a letter
to Senior Retainer Hori.</font>

852
01:16:43,254 --> 01:16:47,190
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">'I will neither run nor hide.
Send a force against me.</font>

853
01:16:47,558 --> 01:16:49,617
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">'One by one I will cut them down...</font>

854
01:16:49,761 --> 01:16:52,423
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">'... until I have built
a mountain of corpses.'</font>

855
01:16:52,930 --> 01:16:54,955
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What pure gall!</font>

856
01:16:55,667 --> 01:16:58,465
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">The Senior Retainer is furious.</font>

857
01:16:58,970 --> 01:17:02,565
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Even weakened by long imprisonment,
Hazama is still...</font>

858
01:17:02,740 --> 01:17:04,901
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...the best swordsman in the clan.</font>

859
01:17:05,176 --> 01:17:08,976
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He would injure or even kill
foot soldiers.</font>

860
01:17:09,113 --> 01:17:12,640
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That is why your name came up.</font>

861
01:17:16,788 --> 01:17:21,521
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You are the only one
who can cut Hazama down.</font>

862
01:17:22,126 --> 01:17:24,686
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">By doing that...</font>

863
01:17:24,896 --> 01:17:29,560
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...you will erase any suspicion
that you have plotted with him.</font>

864
01:17:30,268 --> 01:17:32,532
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Go out and face him.</font>

865
01:17:32,937 --> 01:17:35,929
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Those are the words
of the Senior Retainer.</font>

866
01:17:36,908 --> 01:17:40,207
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Well? Will you do it?</font>

867
01:17:41,879 --> 01:17:47,181
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I am being ordered
to kill an old friend?</font>

868
01:17:49,954 --> 01:17:53,890
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">If you do not, you will be considered
in league with him.</font>

869
01:17:54,959 --> 01:17:58,122
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Well? Will you do it or not?</font>

870
01:18:00,698 --> 01:18:02,290
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Is this an order?</font>

871
01:18:02,467 --> 01:18:05,197
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Yes. It is the order of your clan.</font>

872
01:18:27,225 --> 01:18:31,161
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I understand. I will go.</font>

873
01:18:32,196 --> 01:18:35,962
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Very good. I'll report this
to the Senior Retainer.</font>

874
01:18:36,267 --> 01:18:39,361
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">We'll dispatch a squad of riflemen
today? As well.</font>

875
01:18:39,570 --> 01:18:42,437
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Make your preparations tonight.</font>

876
01:18:42,874 --> 01:18:45,104
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">An official will call in the morning.</font>

877
01:18:45,243 --> 01:18:46,540
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Good luck.</font>

878
01:18:57,855 --> 01:18:59,117
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Toda-sensei...</font>

879
01:19:00,825 --> 01:19:04,818
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Forgive my neglect of you.
Are you well?</font>

880
01:19:11,602 --> 01:19:13,331
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Munezo Katagiri...</font>

881
01:19:14,472 --> 01:19:15,439
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Yes.</font>

882
01:19:16,574 --> 01:19:18,235
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It's been a long time.</font>

883
01:19:21,646 --> 01:19:23,739
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Something worries you.</font>

884
01:19:24,982 --> 01:19:26,449
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What is it?</font>

885
01:19:27,819 --> 01:19:31,949
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Would you remember
a man named Hazama?</font>

886
01:19:32,156 --> 01:19:34,386
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">We studied together.</font>

887
01:19:35,459 --> 01:19:37,188
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Yaichiro Hazama...</font>

888
01:19:38,262 --> 01:19:43,427
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It has come about that
I must face him in combat.</font>

889
01:20:02,220 --> 01:20:06,486
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You and Hazama,
in a fight to the death...</font>

890
01:20:07,725 --> 01:20:12,094
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I always thought
that would happen someday.</font>

891
01:21:22,366 --> 01:21:25,096
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Everyone tenses when swords
are drawn.</font>

892
01:21:28,005 --> 01:21:31,907
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You can tell a man to stay calm?
But he won't.</font>

893
01:21:32,343 --> 01:21:36,404
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He is tense in body and mind.
There's no help for it.</font>

894
01:21:37,481 --> 01:21:38,448
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Now...</font>

895
01:21:39,317 --> 01:21:41,911
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...try to make your body relax.</font>

896
01:21:42,687 --> 01:21:44,450
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Go loose.</font>

897
01:21:47,491 --> 01:21:51,894
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Concentrate on parrying.
If he attacks, step back.</font>

898
01:21:56,367 --> 01:21:58,528
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He will grow angry.</font>

899
01:21:59,904 --> 01:22:01,371
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That is your aim.</font>

900
01:22:05,443 --> 01:22:10,346
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">But while the body retreats?
The spirit does not.</font>

901
01:22:11,015 --> 01:22:13,415
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">The spirit is always attacking.</font>

902
01:22:21,225 --> 01:22:22,283
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I yield.</font>

903
01:22:22,426 --> 01:22:26,055
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Now let me show you something.</font>

904
01:22:33,738 --> 01:22:34,966
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Come at me.</font>

905
01:22:35,940 --> 01:22:36,907
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I will.</font>

906
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:17,142
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I yield.</font>

907
01:23:18,783 --> 01:23:20,307
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Once more.</font>

908
01:23:21,552 --> 01:23:25,989
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Unlike 'The Devil's Claw',
which I taught you long ago...</font>

909
01:23:26,390 --> 01:23:29,291
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...this is meant for use
in a real sword fight.</font>

910
01:24:10,034 --> 01:24:12,195
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It's a dangerous trick.</font>

911
01:24:15,272 --> 01:24:17,069
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Be ready to die.</font>

912
01:24:20,010 --> 01:24:21,341
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I thank you.</font>

913
01:24:52,643 --> 01:24:58,582
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Take your eyes off
your opponent...</font>

914
01:24:59,283 --> 01:25:00,841
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...and turn your back.</font>

915
01:25:04,488 --> 01:25:09,187
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Will I really be able to do
a crazy thing like that?</font>

916
01:25:21,639 --> 01:25:23,163
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Hello?</font>

917
01:25:26,777 --> 01:25:28,335
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">A woman...</font>

918
01:25:29,547 --> 01:25:31,606
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'll go.</font>

919
01:25:44,195 --> 01:25:45,526
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Who is it?</font>

920
01:25:51,235 --> 01:25:54,204
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'm sorry to bother you
this late at night.</font>

921
01:25:55,172 --> 01:25:59,233
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Is this the home
of Squire Munezo Katagiri?</font>

922
01:26:00,010 --> 01:26:02,001
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Yes. I am he.</font>

923
01:26:04,982 --> 01:26:07,007
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Do you remember me?</font>

924
01:26:07,918 --> 01:26:12,048
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I am Yaichiro Hazama's wife.</font>

925
01:26:16,994 --> 01:26:20,486
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I have a favour to ask
concerning my husband.</font>

926
01:26:22,600 --> 01:26:24,397
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Please, come in.</font>

927
01:26:24,535 --> 01:26:25,593
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">No.</font>

928
01:26:26,770 --> 01:26:31,366
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It's not seemly for me
to be calling on you at all.</font>

929
01:26:32,643 --> 01:26:35,168
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'll just sit here, if I may.</font>

930
01:26:59,103 --> 01:27:03,062
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">How may I help you?</font>

931
01:27:03,274 --> 01:27:09,110
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'm told he has fled from his cell.
The man is truly hopeless.</font>

932
01:27:09,246 --> 01:27:13,615
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I was always afraid
something like this would happen.</font>

933
01:27:14,685 --> 01:27:16,209
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You have my sympathy.</font>

934
01:27:16,920 --> 01:27:21,584
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'm also told you have been chosen
to stand against him.</font>

935
01:27:24,194 --> 01:27:27,994
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It is an order from the clan.
I have no choice.</font>

936
01:27:29,333 --> 01:27:31,392
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">When will you go?</font>

937
01:27:32,603 --> 01:27:33,900
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Tomorrow morning.</font>

938
01:27:38,575 --> 01:27:41,305
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Could you possibly let him escape?</font>

939
01:27:42,479 --> 01:27:43,571
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Escape?</font>

940
01:27:44,048 --> 01:27:47,017
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Over the mountains lies Ugo.</font>

941
01:27:47,384 --> 01:27:52,117
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">My husband was born there,
in Satake.</font>

942
01:27:52,389 --> 01:27:55,085
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He can survive there somehow.</font>

943
01:27:56,060 --> 01:27:57,994
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You ask the impossible.</font>

944
01:27:59,697 --> 01:28:06,569
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He intends to kill whoever is sent
after him? And then to die himself.</font>

945
01:28:08,305 --> 01:28:12,105
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">If an old friend like you
were to reason with him...</font>

946
01:28:12,242 --> 01:28:13,937
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...that wouldn't happen.</font>

947
01:28:16,180 --> 01:28:19,081
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You know him well.</font>

948
01:28:20,451 --> 01:28:25,047
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">If he lives he will become
a powerful man.</font>

949
01:28:25,723 --> 01:28:31,719
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It will not hurt your prospects then
if he is in your debt.</font>

950
01:28:33,263 --> 01:28:36,096
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Madam? Please!</font>

951
01:28:36,967 --> 01:28:40,960
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">My gain or loss
is of no consequence.</font>

952
01:28:43,741 --> 01:28:45,766
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">If you wish...</font>

953
01:28:47,745 --> 01:28:50,908
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...I will offer myself to you.</font>

954
01:28:54,318 --> 01:28:57,879
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Whenever you say the word.</font>

955
01:28:58,789 --> 01:29:02,384
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You mustn't say things like that!</font>

956
01:29:03,394 --> 01:29:09,060
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Hazama has made this
a fight to the death.</font>

957
01:29:10,033 --> 01:29:16,632
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He will die? Or I will.
Our lives are both at stake.</font>

958
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:23,742
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I will forget what you've said.</font>

959
01:29:25,115 --> 01:29:26,548
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Please do the same.</font>

960
01:29:27,084 --> 01:29:32,488
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You're an honest man,
just as my husband said.</font>

961
01:29:35,092 --> 01:29:40,724
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'm sorry to have disturbed you
so late. Good night.</font>

962
01:29:41,465 --> 01:29:44,764
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Let me give you a light
for your lantern.</font>

963
01:29:53,811 --> 01:29:57,542
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">The road is dark. Take care.</font>

964
01:30:09,626 --> 01:30:14,325
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'll go to Lord Hori?
The Senior Retainer.</font>

965
01:30:15,365 --> 01:30:18,061
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">The Senior Retainer? Why?</font>

966
01:30:18,669 --> 01:30:24,039
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'll ask him to order you
not to kill Hazama.</font>

967
01:30:24,541 --> 01:30:25,508
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">No!</font>

968
01:30:26,076 --> 01:30:30,069
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You can't trust him!
You'll be wasting your time.</font>

969
01:30:31,648 --> 01:30:33,639
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I know that.</font>

970
01:30:35,118 --> 01:30:37,313
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Madam! Don't!</font>

971
01:31:05,415 --> 01:31:09,249
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Naota, I'm going to write a letter.</font>

972
01:31:11,755 --> 01:31:14,519
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">If I die tomorrow...</font>

973
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:19,761
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...take it to Kie for me.</font>

974
01:31:22,866 --> 01:31:24,060
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Understand?</font>

975
01:31:25,636 --> 01:31:29,163
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Take the letter to Kie.</font>

976
01:31:30,307 --> 01:31:31,274
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Aye.</font>

977
01:32:04,975 --> 01:32:07,307
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Thank you for coming, sir.</font>

978
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:24,658
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That house?</font>

979
01:32:24,795 --> 01:32:25,762
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Aye.</font>

980
01:32:26,296 --> 01:32:29,663
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">There's a lot of smoke
coming from it.</font>

981
01:32:31,001 --> 01:32:34,835
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It looks like he's eating
all the rice they've got.</font>

982
01:32:35,906 --> 01:32:37,430
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">The old man's come out.</font>

983
01:32:37,641 --> 01:32:40,804
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Poor old Kamezo!</font>

984
01:32:50,087 --> 01:32:55,957
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Hazama's holding the old man
and his grand-daughter hostage.</font>

985
01:32:57,060 --> 01:33:01,497
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He's got a sword
he's holding on the girl...</font>

986
01:33:01,698 --> 01:33:04,599
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...so our hands are tied.</font>

987
01:33:06,737 --> 01:33:10,036
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Would you like to watch
for a while?</font>

988
01:33:11,241 --> 01:33:13,607
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'll get ready and go.</font>

989
01:33:13,777 --> 01:33:16,405
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">How long should we wait?</font>

990
01:33:16,647 --> 01:33:21,084
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">We have orders to shoot?
Even if it means killing the hostages.</font>

991
01:33:21,218 --> 01:33:22,116
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">No.</font>

992
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:26,148
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'll have it settled by dark.</font>

993
01:33:27,624 --> 01:33:32,994
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">If I'm not back by sunset,
the rest is in your hands.</font>

994
01:33:33,196 --> 01:33:34,493
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Yes? Sir.</font>

995
01:34:17,741 --> 01:34:22,178
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Well? If it isn't Katagiri!
They sent you after me?</font>

996
01:34:24,748 --> 01:34:26,648
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Let me talk to you.</font>

997
01:34:31,922 --> 01:34:32,946
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Go in.</font>

998
01:34:50,273 --> 01:34:51,604
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Are you well?</font>

999
01:34:57,581 --> 01:35:00,072
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">How do you think I'd be...</font>

1000
01:35:00,250 --> 01:35:03,310
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...locked in a dark cell
on two bowls of gruel of day?</font>

1001
01:35:03,453 --> 01:35:04,943
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Let's not waste words.</font>

1002
01:35:08,391 --> 01:35:10,086
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I guess you're right.</font>

1003
01:35:13,130 --> 01:35:17,726
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">So what are you here to do?
Kill me?</font>

1004
01:35:20,871 --> 01:35:24,671
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Commit suicide?
As a samurai should.</font>

1005
01:35:25,308 --> 01:35:26,798
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'll be your second.</font>

1006
01:35:28,478 --> 01:35:30,105
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">And if I say no?</font>

1007
01:35:32,082 --> 01:35:33,310
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Then I must...</font>

1008
01:35:34,851 --> 01:35:36,045
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...kill you.</font>

1009
01:35:37,721 --> 01:35:39,279
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">The clan orders it.</font>

1010
01:35:43,727 --> 01:35:45,058
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">The clan!</font>

1011
01:35:47,631 --> 01:35:52,591
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Hori sent you? Didn't he.
'Go kill that rebel? ' he said.</font>

1012
01:35:53,236 --> 01:35:54,168
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Aye.</font>

1013
01:36:01,011 --> 01:36:05,675
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That meddlesome old fool!</font>

1014
01:36:08,151 --> 01:36:13,919
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">This isn't the time to argue about
opening up to the foreigners or not.</font>

1015
01:36:15,358 --> 01:36:19,522
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What we're doing is for the clan?
And for the country!</font>

1016
01:36:19,663 --> 01:36:21,654
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">There's nothing disloyal about it!</font>

1017
01:36:23,633 --> 01:36:27,364
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">The one who should be struck down
is Hori...</font>

1018
01:36:27,504 --> 01:36:31,770
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...who cares only for filling his
own pockets. He's the traitor!</font>

1019
01:36:34,511 --> 01:36:35,375
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Hazama...</font>

1020
01:36:35,512 --> 01:36:36,638
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What?</font>

1021
01:36:38,782 --> 01:36:42,878
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">There are riflemen
all around this house.</font>

1022
01:36:44,754 --> 01:36:48,656
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You'll never get out of here alive.</font>

1023
01:36:51,595 --> 01:36:55,292
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">So they're going to kill me
with guns, are they?</font>

1024
01:36:57,934 --> 01:36:58,866
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Hey...</font>

1025
01:36:59,936 --> 01:37:03,929
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...I'm sure you haven't forgotten,
four years ago before His Lordship.</font>

1026
01:37:05,675 --> 01:37:07,768
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I lost to you.</font>

1027
01:37:08,912 --> 01:37:13,076
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">'Hazama lost to Katagiri? ' they said.
'Serves him right! '</font>

1028
01:37:13,884 --> 01:37:16,216
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">The whole clan laughed at me.</font>

1029
01:37:16,353 --> 01:37:17,342
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">But...</font>

1030
01:37:19,189 --> 01:37:21,180
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...I was holding back.</font>

1031
01:37:22,592 --> 01:37:27,256
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">If I'd meant to, I could have
smashed your skull wide open.</font>

1032
01:37:28,365 --> 01:37:31,630
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I didn't because it was
before His Lordship.</font>

1033
01:37:32,903 --> 01:37:34,564
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I knew that.</font>

1034
01:37:35,739 --> 01:37:37,229
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You did?</font>

1035
01:37:39,676 --> 01:37:43,635
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Fine, then! We'll settle accounts
with real swords now.</font>

1036
01:37:45,081 --> 01:37:49,017
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Those bastards will think again
when I kill you.</font>

1037
01:37:50,720 --> 01:37:55,623
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I am the best swordsman
in the Unasaka Clan!</font>

1038
01:37:56,726 --> 01:37:58,717
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Draw!</font>

1039
01:37:59,996 --> 01:38:03,090
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Some farmer did had this
hidden for years.</font>

1040
01:38:03,700 --> 01:38:06,726
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It's rusty? But it still cuts.</font>

1041
01:38:08,004 --> 01:38:09,904
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Use your head, will you?</font>

1042
01:38:10,874 --> 01:38:16,244
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">If you kill yourself according to
the law, you keep your honour.</font>

1043
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:21,280
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Killing you in a fight
will keep me my honour.</font>

1044
01:38:21,418 --> 01:38:22,476
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Wait!</font>

1045
01:38:23,653 --> 01:38:26,315
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Think of your wife!</font>

1046
01:38:27,757 --> 01:38:33,195
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">If you don't kill yourself,
she'll be the wife of a criminal!</font>

1047
01:38:34,030 --> 01:38:38,296
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I've told her to cut her throat
and follow me.</font>

1048
01:38:38,435 --> 01:38:40,494
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You don't have to fret over that.</font>

1049
01:38:40,737 --> 01:38:42,261
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Cut her throat?</font>

1050
01:38:43,440 --> 01:38:46,307
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Why make her do a thing like that?</font>

1051
01:38:50,714 --> 01:38:55,083
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Since when is my wife
of concern to you?</font>

1052
01:38:55,785 --> 01:38:56,877
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Draw!</font>

1053
01:39:00,623 --> 01:39:01,954
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Draw, will you!</font>

1054
01:39:05,362 --> 01:39:08,889
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You always were good
at getting out of the way.</font>

1055
01:39:16,740 --> 01:39:19,334
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Do you insist, Hazama?</font>

1056
01:39:59,215 --> 01:40:01,206
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Have you ever killed a man?</font>

1057
01:40:02,452 --> 01:40:03,316
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">No.</font>

1058
01:40:04,087 --> 01:40:07,887
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I've killed several? In Edo.
Just to try my hand.</font>

1059
01:40:28,011 --> 01:40:29,444
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Hurry!</font>

1060
01:40:36,820 --> 01:40:37,787
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What?</font>

1061
01:40:39,055 --> 01:40:40,818
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Why don't you attack?</font>

1062
01:40:45,595 --> 01:40:47,187
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Are you afraid?</font>

1063
01:41:15,558 --> 01:41:19,119
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Are you going to use
'The Hidden Blade'?</font>

1064
01:41:20,263 --> 01:41:23,858
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That 'Devil's Claw' trick
that Toda-sensei taught you?</font>

1065
01:41:24,667 --> 01:41:28,068
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He should have
passed that down to me!</font>

1066
01:41:30,273 --> 01:41:34,107
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Come on, then.
Show me 'The Devil's Claw'.</font>

1067
01:41:35,044 --> 01:41:37,012
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">If that's how you mean to kill me...</font>

1068
01:41:37,814 --> 01:41:38,940
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...then try.</font>

1069
01:41:41,217 --> 01:41:46,052
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">'The Devil's Claw' isn't something
you use in a sword fight.</font>

1070
01:41:47,457 --> 01:41:51,791
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">And I didn't learn it
to use on you!</font>

1071
01:41:52,328 --> 01:41:53,192
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Damn you!</font>

1072
01:42:13,149 --> 01:42:16,016
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Enough of this! Kill yourself!</font>

1073
01:42:17,687 --> 01:42:19,552
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">After I kill you!</font>

1074
01:42:32,068 --> 01:42:33,330
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What, you're running?</font>

1075
01:43:30,226 --> 01:43:31,591
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What was that?</font>

1076
01:43:33,062 --> 01:43:34,586
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">'The Devil's Claw'?</font>

1077
01:43:36,833 --> 01:43:37,925
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">No.</font>

1078
01:43:39,235 --> 01:43:41,396
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That wasn't 'The Devil's Claw'.</font>

1079
01:43:42,138 --> 01:43:44,299
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That was a coward's trick.</font>

1080
01:43:45,408 --> 01:43:46,602
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'll kill you!</font>

1081
01:43:51,180 --> 01:43:52,147
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Wait!</font>

1082
01:43:52,448 --> 01:43:54,109
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Hold your fire!</font>

1083
01:44:13,469 --> 01:44:14,493
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Hazama!</font>

1084
01:44:31,754 --> 01:44:33,016
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Hazama...</font>

1085
01:44:37,627 --> 01:44:38,924
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...I'm sorry!</font>

1086
01:44:42,265 --> 01:44:44,233
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You wouldn't have wanted...</font>

1087
01:44:46,669 --> 01:44:48,432
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...to die by the gun!</font>

1088
01:46:10,787 --> 01:46:12,482
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'm very sorry.</font>

1089
01:46:15,358 --> 01:46:19,294
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I pray you will not hate me.</font>

1090
01:46:24,634 --> 01:46:30,163
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I have some things to tell you
of how your husband met his end...</font>

1091
01:46:31,607 --> 01:46:34,804
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...but first I must report
to the Senior Retainer.</font>

1092
01:46:36,612 --> 01:46:38,273
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'll take my leave.</font>

1093
01:46:39,315 --> 01:46:40,646
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Squire Katagiri...</font>

1094
01:46:43,152 --> 01:46:48,954
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...did the Senior Retainer not tell you
to spare my husband?</font>

1095
01:46:51,394 --> 01:46:52,361
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What?!</font>

1096
01:46:53,162 --> 01:46:57,394
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He promised me he would.</font>

1097
01:46:58,034 --> 01:47:02,971
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You really went to
the Senior Retainer's home last night?</font>

1098
01:47:03,739 --> 01:47:07,937
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">And he told you
he would spare Hazama?</font>

1099
01:47:11,347 --> 01:47:13,508
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You've been a fool!</font>

1100
01:47:15,218 --> 01:47:17,118
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I told you not to go!</font>

1101
01:47:17,453 --> 01:47:19,353
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I knew that would happen!</font>

1102
01:47:19,655 --> 01:47:22,453
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He said nothing to me.</font>

1103
01:47:24,760 --> 01:47:26,819
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You've been deceived.</font>

1104
01:48:16,178 --> 01:48:17,509
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Here they are.</font>

1105
01:48:21,117 --> 01:48:26,419
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">He was standing at the front door.
I had to drag him in here.</font>

1106
01:48:26,622 --> 01:48:28,613
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Well? Here you are!</font>

1107
01:48:29,258 --> 01:48:33,957
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Well done!
I was sure you'd beat him.</font>

1108
01:48:35,965 --> 01:48:41,267
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">No, it was the new guns
that got me out of a tight spot.</font>

1109
01:48:41,437 --> 01:48:44,304
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Oh? You used the guns?</font>

1110
01:48:44,473 --> 01:48:50,469
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">We'd never used them on a man before.
They're very effective.</font>

1111
01:48:50,613 --> 01:48:53,480
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Far better than matchlocks.</font>

1112
01:48:53,649 --> 01:48:57,608
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">They were expensive,
but I guess they're worth it.</font>

1113
01:48:58,087 --> 01:49:01,056
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Katagiri, come here.
We'll drink a pledge.</font>

1114
01:49:12,668 --> 01:49:17,367
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">This man has just killed
a samurai in a duel.</font>

1115
01:49:17,607 --> 01:49:22,169
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">His opponent was the greatest
swordsman in the Unasaka clan!</font>

1116
01:49:22,411 --> 01:49:23,469
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That's awful!</font>

1117
01:49:25,581 --> 01:49:31,781
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">We'd certainly like to hear about it?
But this is not the time.</font>

1118
01:49:32,555 --> 01:49:35,581
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You may greet the Senior Retainer
and withdraw.</font>

1119
01:49:35,958 --> 01:49:38,290
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">There'll be a reward for you.</font>

1120
01:49:42,331 --> 01:49:43,127
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Hey!</font>

1121
01:49:44,634 --> 01:49:46,499
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I said you may leave.</font>

1122
01:49:51,273 --> 01:49:54,674
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I have something to ask
the Senior Retainer.</font>

1123
01:49:54,810 --> 01:49:55,742
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What?</font>

1124
01:49:56,679 --> 01:50:01,207
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Did you receive a visit last night
from Hazama's wife?</font>

1125
01:50:02,618 --> 01:50:04,643
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">How did you know that?</font>

1126
01:50:06,322 --> 01:50:10,383
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Hazama's wife came
to my house last night.</font>

1127
01:50:10,626 --> 01:50:14,118
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">She said she was going
to see you.</font>

1128
01:50:17,967 --> 01:50:18,934
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Yes.</font>

1129
01:50:21,170 --> 01:50:22,569
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">She did.</font>

1130
01:50:23,873 --> 01:50:25,500
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">She's beautiful...</font>

1131
01:50:25,675 --> 01:50:26,835
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...so they say.</font>

1132
01:50:26,976 --> 01:50:30,707
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">She is. I wondered what she wanted
so late at night...</font>

1133
01:50:31,213 --> 01:50:36,549
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...but as she was so attractive,
I brought her here and heard her out.</font>

1134
01:50:36,686 --> 01:50:37,983
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What did she want?</font>

1135
01:50:38,120 --> 01:50:39,314
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">His life.</font>

1136
01:50:39,922 --> 01:50:44,325
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">She asked me to order Katagiri
to let Hazama escape.</font>

1137
01:50:44,860 --> 01:50:49,524
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Imagine a criminal's wife asking
such a thing! Out of the question!</font>

1138
01:50:49,665 --> 01:50:50,723
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">So you refused?</font>

1139
01:50:50,866 --> 01:50:51,992
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Of course.</font>

1140
01:50:52,368 --> 01:50:55,769
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">But? Koda,
she was very beautiful.</font>

1141
01:50:56,038 --> 01:50:59,064
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">She turned her charm on me,
and I couldn't say no.</font>

1142
01:50:59,208 --> 01:51:03,907
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What man could resist
a woman like that?</font>

1143
01:51:04,814 --> 01:51:08,011
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">So you and the lady...</font>

1144
01:51:08,150 --> 01:51:12,416
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Yes. I enjoyed her to the full?
There in the next room.</font>

1145
01:51:15,491 --> 01:51:21,088
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">But sir, I received no order
from you...</font>

1146
01:51:21,797 --> 01:51:23,856
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...to let Hazama escape.</font>

1147
01:51:24,100 --> 01:51:30,005
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Of course not! She knew very well
she was asking the impossible.</font>

1148
01:51:30,740 --> 01:51:35,200
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">As proof of that,
she enjoyed herself immensely.</font>

1149
01:51:35,411 --> 01:51:39,040
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">A fine body she has? Too.</font>

1150
01:51:44,453 --> 01:51:48,048
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">And? What is it you wish to say?</font>

1151
01:51:50,559 --> 01:51:52,550
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Senior Retainer or not...</font>

1152
01:51:54,430 --> 01:51:58,059
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...to take advantage of a wife
pleading for her husband's life...</font>

1153
01:51:59,735 --> 01:52:01,669
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...was a foul thing to do.</font>

1154
01:52:03,038 --> 01:52:04,903
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...to Hazama's wife!</font>

1155
01:52:07,042 --> 01:52:10,068
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You presume upon
my kind words to you.</font>

1156
01:52:10,913 --> 01:52:12,972
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I did what she wanted!</font>

1157
01:52:13,449 --> 01:52:15,508
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Your impertinence knows no end!</font>

1158
01:52:18,020 --> 01:52:19,419
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'll deal with you later!</font>

1159
01:52:21,290 --> 01:52:21,949
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Fool!</font>

1160
01:52:22,158 --> 01:52:23,022
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Sir!</font>

1161
01:52:44,013 --> 01:52:50,316
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I wanted to see Hazama's wife
nd tell her not to be rash...</font>

1162
01:52:51,120 --> 01:52:55,853
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...and that life is a treasure
not to be lightly discarded...</font>

1163
01:52:56,959 --> 01:52:58,426
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...but I was too late.</font>

1164
01:54:43,432 --> 01:54:45,366
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Square formation!</font>

1165
01:54:54,743 --> 01:54:57,769
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Prepare to resist cavalry!</font>

1166
01:54:59,581 --> 01:55:01,276
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Fall in!</font>

1167
01:55:01,617 --> 01:55:02,845
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Right turn!</font>

1168
01:55:03,052 --> 01:55:04,178
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Forward, march!</font>

1169
01:55:35,484 --> 01:55:37,042
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Not a damned drop!</font>

1170
01:55:38,020 --> 01:55:39,783
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Go on! You bother me!</font>

1171
01:55:40,889 --> 01:55:44,723
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">After all the money
I've paid that quack!</font>

1172
01:55:50,833 --> 01:55:52,061
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Damn it!</font>

1173
01:56:13,856 --> 01:56:16,791
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Katagiri? What do you want?</font>

1174
01:56:53,996 --> 01:56:55,020
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Sir?</font>

1175
01:56:56,065 --> 01:56:57,191
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Sir!</font>

1176
01:56:57,933 --> 01:56:59,093
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What's wrong?!</font>

1177
01:56:59,368 --> 01:57:00,892
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Are you ill?</font>

1178
01:57:01,603 --> 01:57:02,501
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Sir?</font>

1179
01:57:03,138 --> 01:57:03,695
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Sir!</font>

1180
01:57:03,872 --> 01:57:04,770
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What's wrong?</font>

1181
01:57:06,675 --> 01:57:08,802
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Don't move him! Bring the doctor!</font>

1182
01:57:15,484 --> 01:57:17,349
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Doctor! Hurry? Please!</font>

1183
01:57:27,229 --> 01:57:28,161
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Doctor!</font>

1184
01:57:29,631 --> 01:57:30,893
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Help him!</font>

1185
01:57:42,211 --> 01:57:43,701
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Well? Doctor?</font>

1186
01:57:44,546 --> 01:57:50,712
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It's as if some thing’s been sent
straight through his heart.</font>

1187
01:57:51,253 --> 01:57:54,245
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Certainly this wound
is the cause of death.</font>

1188
01:57:54,790 --> 01:57:59,887
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">How could that happen
without any bleeding?</font>

1189
01:58:00,863 --> 01:58:02,854
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Yes... what caused the wound?</font>

1190
01:58:05,567 --> 01:58:07,432
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Could it have been...</font>

1191
01:58:08,737 --> 01:58:12,730
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...something other than human,
perhaps?</font>

1192
01:58:14,843 --> 01:58:17,073
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I wouldn't move him.</font>

1193
01:58:18,046 --> 01:58:21,345
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Inside he's probably
a sea of blood.</font>

1194
01:58:59,154 --> 01:59:05,093
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I have taken vengeance
for you and for Hazama.</font>

1195
01:59:11,800 --> 01:59:16,499
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">May you rise to Buddha.</font>

1196
02:00:04,419 --> 02:00:09,049
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">But why...</font>

1197
02:00:10,158 --> 02:00:11,887
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...do I feel so empty?</font>

1198
02:00:20,202 --> 02:00:25,401
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What will I do now?</font>

1199
02:00:33,715 --> 02:00:39,347
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I resigned my position
nd abandoned my samurai status.</font>

1200
02:00:40,622 --> 02:00:42,886
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I never want to kill again.</font>

1201
02:01:12,454 --> 02:01:14,945
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'll leave you here.</font>

1202
02:01:16,058 --> 02:01:18,925
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Ezo... that's a long ways to go.</font>

1203
02:01:20,729 --> 02:01:23,630
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">You poor man... all alone
in that wilderness!</font>

1204
02:01:24,599 --> 02:01:27,693
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">If only you had a wife
to go with you!</font>

1205
02:01:34,409 --> 02:01:38,937
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Shimada... take good care
of this crybaby, will you?</font>

1206
02:01:39,781 --> 02:01:44,081
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">We'll be fine.
Don't you worry about us.</font>

1207
02:01:50,892 --> 02:01:53,861
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Is this the last
we'll ever see of you?</font>

1208
02:02:04,506 --> 02:02:06,736
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Shino, I'm going.</font>

1209
02:02:15,584 --> 02:02:16,516
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Goodbye.</font>

1210
02:03:09,204 --> 02:03:10,296
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Sis!</font>

1211
02:03:11,807 --> 02:03:12,967
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">A visitor!</font>

1212
02:03:14,276 --> 02:03:15,402
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">The Master!</font>

1213
02:03:16,378 --> 02:03:17,675
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Oh? My!</font>

1214
02:03:25,020 --> 02:03:27,420
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">How have you been? Kie?</font>

1215
02:03:28,323 --> 02:03:29,813
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What brings you here?</font>

1216
02:03:31,493 --> 02:03:33,654
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">And why are you dressed like that?</font>

1217
02:03:33,795 --> 02:03:36,423
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Are you going on a journey?</font>

1218
02:03:36,598 --> 02:03:40,364
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Are you going to Edo?
Or maybe Kyoto?</font>

1219
02:03:40,502 --> 02:03:44,836
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Now? Now? Calm down.
That's why I've come to see you.</font>

1220
02:03:46,174 --> 02:03:48,142
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Let's sit over there.</font>

1221
02:04:12,467 --> 02:04:14,196
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Is farm work hard?</font>

1222
02:04:16,872 --> 02:04:22,742
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">We're about to start planting,
so it's the busiest time of the year.</font>

1223
02:04:23,512 --> 02:04:29,576
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">But compared to the Iseya?
With that old witch yelling at me...</font>

1224
02:04:29,784 --> 02:04:33,220
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...and working so hard
I had no time to eat...</font>

1225
02:04:33,522 --> 02:04:37,185
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...this is nothing. It's child's play.</font>

1226
02:04:38,760 --> 02:04:40,022
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I see...</font>

1227
02:04:43,331 --> 02:04:49,793
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'm sorry about coming
to talk to you at such a busy time...</font>

1228
02:04:50,872 --> 02:04:52,430
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">What is it?</font>

1229
02:04:56,344 --> 02:05:00,781
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Have you made any arrangements
for a marriage?</font>

1230
02:05:02,284 --> 02:05:06,516
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">My father's brought
any number of offers...</font>

1231
02:05:06,988 --> 02:05:11,118
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">But you haven't accepted any?</font>

1232
02:05:14,930 --> 02:05:16,363
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">It so happens...</font>

1233
02:05:18,333 --> 02:05:20,528
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...I'm going to the island of Ezo.</font>

1234
02:05:21,703 --> 02:05:25,161
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Ezo? Way up north?</font>

1235
02:05:26,374 --> 02:05:28,467
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'm sick of being a samurai.</font>

1236
02:05:29,578 --> 02:05:34,277
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I've renounced my status.
I'm a townsman now.</font>

1237
02:05:36,384 --> 02:05:40,377
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I'm thinking of going into trade
in Ezo.</font>

1238
02:05:41,489 --> 02:05:45,220
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">How long will it take you
to get there?</font>

1239
02:05:46,995 --> 02:05:51,625
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">A month, two if the seas are rough.</font>

1240
02:05:52,467 --> 02:05:56,563
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">But then I'll never
be able to see you again!</font>

1241
02:06:06,715 --> 02:06:07,841
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Kie...</font>

1242
02:06:09,684 --> 02:06:11,675
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...will you come with me?</font>

1243
02:06:13,788 --> 02:06:17,087
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">There's no hardship I can't bear
if I'm with you.</font>

1244
02:06:18,193 --> 02:06:21,720
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">That's what I've come here to say.</font>

1245
02:06:24,933 --> 02:06:29,768
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Will you be my wife?</font>

1246
02:06:30,939 --> 02:06:34,397
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Well... this is all so sudden...</font>

1247
02:06:34,542 --> 02:06:36,373
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">There's nothing stopping us.</font>

1248
02:06:36,945 --> 02:06:40,472
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">If I love you? And you love me,
that's all we need.</font>

1249
02:06:42,951 --> 02:06:44,612
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">And I love you.</font>

1250
02:06:46,955 --> 02:06:50,891
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I have ever since
I first saw you.</font>

1251
02:06:54,829 --> 02:06:55,796
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Kie...</font>

1252
02:06:59,167 --> 02:07:00,600
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">...what do you think?</font>

1253
02:07:03,238 --> 02:07:08,835
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">I've never ever
given it a thought!</font>

1254
02:07:12,313 --> 02:07:16,477
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Would you give it a thought now?</font>

1255
02:07:31,666 --> 02:07:32,928
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Well?</font>

1256
02:07:37,338 --> 02:07:38,999
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Have you thought about it?</font>

1257
02:07:48,483 --> 02:07:49,677
<font color="#ff8000" face="Goudy Old Style">Is that...</font>
