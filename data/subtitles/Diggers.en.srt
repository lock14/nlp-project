into work this morning, </i>

13
00:00:53,234 --> 00:00:56,400
<i>this is "Hold On To Freedom"

14
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,200
<i>* Hold on to freedom *</i>

15
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,968
<i>* Freedom's the only
Thing you have *</i>

16
00:01:17,501 --> 00:01:21,000
<i>* Hold on to justice *</i>

17
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,434
<i>* Justice is
Your only lamp *</i>

18
00:01:24,434 --> 00:01:28,133
<i>All right, all right.
* I saw the meaning *</i>

19
00:01:28,133 --> 00:01:30,734
<i>* The meaning
In the sun, the sky *</i>

20
00:01:30,734 --> 00:01:34,667
<i>* It said, "Lady, ring *</i>

21
00:01:34,667 --> 00:01:37,667
<i>* You'd better just
Let it slide" *</i>

22
00:01:38,734 --> 00:01:41,734
<i>* My life is for livin' *</i>

23
00:01:41,734 --> 00:01:44,234
<i>* And livin' is for fun *</i>

24
00:01:44,234 --> 00:01:46,701
<i>* So you'd better just
Change your mind *</i>

25
00:01:48,567 --> 00:01:51,534
<i>* Change your mind
While you got one *</i>

26
00:01:52,801 --> 00:01:55,767
<i>* Hold onto freedom *</i>

27
00:01:55,767 --> 00:01:58,968

<i>* Hold onto justice *</i>

29
00:02:02,834 --> 00:02:05,634
<i>* Justice is
Your biggest laugh *</i>

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,000
<i>* When they look
For something *</i>

31
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,901
<i>* And something
Looks for them *</i>

32
00:02:13,968 --> 00:02:17,033
<i>* Just like a jungle *</i>

33
00:02:17,033 --> 00:02:21,033
<i>* A jungle where
You've never been *</i>

34
00:02:21,033 --> 00:02:23,968
<i>* Each day is filled
With changes *</i>

35
00:02:23,968 --> 00:02:27,234
<i>* And each new change
Means a new day for me *</i>

36
00:02:27,234 --> 00:02:29,133
<i>* So you'd better hold on *</i>

37
00:02:31,234 --> 00:02:33,467
<i>* Hold on while you can see *</i>

38
00:02:33,467 --> 00:02:34,968
<i>* Help me now *</i>

39
00:02:34,968 --> 00:02:36,567
<i>* Whoo *</i>

40
00:02:36,567 --> 00:02:39,834
<i>* Babe, whoo *</i>

<i>* Each day is filled with
With changes *</i>

42
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,000

Each change *</i>

43

<i>* Means a new day for me *</i>

44
00:02:48,934 --> 00:02:51,234
<i>* So you'd better
Better hold *</i>

45
00:02:51,234 --> 00:02:52,601
<i>* You'd better hold *</i>

46

47
00:02:55,567 --> 00:02:56,701

<i>* Hold onto justice, yeah *</i>

50
00:03:03,334 --> 00:03:06,200
<i>* Hold on to your brother
Whoo *</i>

51
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:09,567
<i>* Hold onto everything
That means something to you *</i>

52
00:03:09,567 --> 00:03:12,434
<i>* Something to you
Something to you *</i>

53
00:03:12,434 --> 00:03:15,100
<i>* Something to you
Something to you *</i>

54
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:16,534
That's the one.

55
00:03:41,634 --> 00:03:43,400
Hey, Gina.
Hey, Mr. Wilson.

56
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,868
Hey, Hunt.

57
00:03:49,601 --> 00:03:51,400
Lay off the reefer.

58
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:53,133
What?
Never touch the stuff.

59
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:56,133
You're late.
Am I?

60
00:03:56,133 --> 00:03:58,167
Dad was here an hour ago
waiting for you.

61
00:03:58,167 --> 00:03:59,734
Didn't ask him to.

62
00:03:59,734 --> 00:04:01,567
No, but you know
he does, so...

63
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:03,834
why not show up?
Food please.

64
00:04:03,834 --> 00:04:05,501
What do I look like,
your mother?

65
00:04:05,501 --> 00:04:07,901
Starting to.

66
00:04:07,901 --> 00:04:10,434
Shit. Really?

67
00:04:10,434 --> 00:04:11,901
Come on, hurry up.
Be vain later.

68
00:04:11,901 --> 00:04:13,601
Well, what do you want?
Decide.

69
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:15,834
No. Surprise me.

70
00:04:15,834 --> 00:04:17,968
Eggs.

71
00:04:17,968 --> 00:04:20,234
Old man likes
to get out early, huh?

72
00:04:20,234 --> 00:04:23,667
Yeah, he has to. He's gettin'
old and slow. Oh, yeah.

73
00:04:23,667 --> 00:04:25,601
And I'll have
two coffees.

74
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:27,300
One black,
three sugars.

75
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,501
For Dad?
Yeah.

76
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:30,300
Thought I'd use it
as a peace offering.

77
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,267
Do you believe this shit?

78
00:04:32,267 --> 00:04:35,234
Jesus Christ,
South Shell fucks.

79
00:04:35,234 --> 00:04:37,000
I tell you,
they're killin' us.

80
00:04:38,334 --> 00:04:40,100
Black, three sugars.
Milk, one sugar.

81
00:04:42,033 --> 00:04:43,767
Good luck in finding him.

82
00:04:43,767 --> 00:04:45,567
That's all right.
We got a meeting place.

83
00:04:45,567 --> 00:04:47,067
I know where he is.

84
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:48,834
It's nice. We don't
have to talk too much.

85
00:04:48,834 --> 00:04:50,367
We're too far away
from each other.

86
00:04:50,367 --> 00:04:53,501
That's how
we communicate best.

87
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:57,100
<i>Yesterday the township leased
400 additional square acres</i>

88
00:04:57,100 --> 00:04:58,968
<i>of the Great South Bay's
bottomland</i>

89
00:04:58,968 --> 00:05:01,968
<i>to the South Shell fishery, 
a private corporation. </i>

90
00:05:01,968 --> 00:05:04,067
<i>That's bad news
for our local baymen. </i>

91
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:06,934
<i>The harvesting of clams

92
00:05:06,934 --> 00:05:08,834
<i>pollution in the bay

00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,167
<i>--are adding to an already
arduous trade. </i>

00:05:12,167 --> 00:05:14,868
<i>South Shell warns that--

95
00:05:14,868 --> 00:05:17,400
<i>--entering restricted waters

102

Stay.

What's going down, Jack?

110
00:06:00,734 --> 00:06:03,167
Cons, Lisa.

111
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:04,634
Lisa, Cons.

112
00:06:04,634 --> 00:06:05,801
Hi.

113
00:06:05,801 --> 00:06:07,400
I certainly am.

114
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,634
Thank you.

115
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,701
That's why I'm here.

116
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:22,634
Anthony, go outside.
Daddy's having private time.

117
00:06:22,634 --> 00:06:24,367
Daddy poop.

118
00:06:30,434 --> 00:06:33,300
Julie.
What?

119
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,467
Julie!

120
00:06:35,467 --> 00:06:36,868
I said what?

121
00:06:36,868 --> 00:06:38,501
What the fuck
is going on down there?

122
00:06:38,501 --> 00:06:39,934
Language. What?

123
00:06:39,934 --> 00:06:41,167
Don't "what" me.

124
00:06:41,167 --> 00:06:43,601
Keep the fucking kids
under control.
What?

125
00:06:43,601 --> 00:06:45,267
Kids are running around
like monkeys,

126
00:06:45,267 --> 00:06:46,667
running in here
when I'm in here.

127
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:47,968
So fix the lock.

128
00:06:47,968 --> 00:06:50,000
Stop feeding them
sugar cereal.

129
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,567
Fucking...

130
00:06:51,567 --> 00:06:54,834
I am not an octopus, Frankie.
I am not an octopus.

131
00:06:54,834 --> 00:06:55,934
Bouncing off the walls.

132
00:06:55,934 --> 00:06:57,334
I got two hands,
that's all I got.

133
00:06:57,334 --> 00:06:59,033
Get off your brother.

134
00:06:59,033 --> 00:07:01,334
Do me a favor. Keep 'em
outta here when I'm in here.

135
00:07:01,334 --> 00:07:02,834
Would you do that
for me, please?

136
00:07:02,834 --> 00:07:05,033
Fix the lock
and stop crying.

137
00:07:05,033 --> 00:07:07,267
Crying? I'll fucking--

138
00:07:07,267 --> 00:07:09,968
I'll break the fucking door,
Jesus Christ!

139
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,300
Julie, quick,
bring the camera.

140
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,133
Anthony's just like Daddy.

141
00:07:24,501 --> 00:07:25,801
You're just like Daddy.

142
00:07:51,834 --> 00:07:54,133
Now, that's--
That's very interesting.

143
00:07:54,133 --> 00:07:56,634
All right.
Let me run this by him.

144
00:07:56,634 --> 00:07:58,434
Let me-- Go out on a limb here.

145
00:07:58,434 --> 00:07:59,934
Okay. Bye.

146
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,067
Come here.

147
00:09:34,334 --> 00:09:36,968
Yeah, I know, I know.
I overslept.

148
00:09:36,968 --> 00:09:38,367
Come on, give me
a break, right?

149
00:09:38,367 --> 00:09:41,300
You like to get out early.

150
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,934
You know, look,
I brought you coffee, all right?

151
00:09:43,934 --> 00:09:46,701
Sit down, we'll talk.

152
00:09:46,701 --> 00:09:48,367
You can cool off.

153
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:51,367
I'm not telling you what to do.

154
00:09:51,367 --> 00:09:54,067
No. I mean, every time--

155
00:09:55,434 --> 00:09:57,300
Where are you?

156
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:04,434
Where are you?

157
00:10:05,501 --> 00:10:08,167
Oh, no.

158
00:10:46,434 --> 00:10:48,467
He looks ridiculous.

159
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:51,267
No, he doesn't.

160
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,033
It's what he got
married in, right?

161
00:10:57,033 --> 00:10:59,133
Mom would have
liked it.

162
00:10:59,133 --> 00:11:02,167
He looks, uh...

163
00:11:02,167 --> 00:11:03,567
... handsome.

164
00:11:03,567 --> 00:11:05,968
Yeah, well, that's one day
in Dad's life.

165
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:08,734
And that'sDad.

166
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,934
Okay, let's take off
his suit.

167
00:11:18,567 --> 00:11:20,801
We'll leave him in there
in his dirty underwear.

168
00:11:21,968 --> 00:11:24,734
Scotch in one hand
and the, uh...

169
00:11:24,734 --> 00:11:26,934
<i>And the TV Guide
in the other.</i>

170
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:36,567
I can't lose Dad.

171
00:11:36,567 --> 00:11:38,100
I know.

172
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,968
<i>I don't care</i>

173
00:11:42,968 --> 00:11:44,167
if it's not fair,
I said no.

174
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:45,701
Why not?
No means no.

175
00:11:45,701 --> 00:11:47,501
Your father said no,
that's it. In the car.

176
00:11:47,501 --> 00:11:49,267
It's not fair.
Ralph saw it last summer,

177
00:11:49,267 --> 00:11:50,667
and he's 7.

178
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:52,801
So why can't I see it now?
It's at the mall.

179
00:11:52,801 --> 00:11:54,400
Hey, Frankie Jr. ,
lay off.

180
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,834
Because it's too scary,
you go see that shark movie--

181
00:11:56,834 --> 00:11:59,000
<i>It's called Jaws. 
I gotta pee.</i>

182
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,701
Donna, take your brother inside.
The rest of you, in the car now.

183
00:12:01,701 --> 00:12:03,834
I know what it's called,
smart ass, I saw it, okay?

184
00:12:03,834 --> 00:12:05,200
<i>You see that Jaws movie,</i>

185
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,267
you'll be up all night
shaking in your Underoos,

186
00:12:07,267 --> 00:12:08,667
which means I'll
be up all night,

187
00:12:08,667 --> 00:12:10,133
which means
I'm not gonna sleep,

188
00:12:10,133 --> 00:12:11,734
which means
you're not gonna see it!

189
00:12:11,734 --> 00:12:13,834
Shark blows up in the end,
save your money.

190
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,634
All right,
what's up your hole now?

191
00:12:18,634 --> 00:12:19,934
Look, can I just say
I'm the one

192
00:12:19,934 --> 00:12:21,534
who's gonna be
chasing after the kids

193
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:23,267
because you wouldn't pay
for a sitter?

194
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:27,000
You don't bring kids
to a funeral, Frankie.

195
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,501
Who says?

196
00:12:28,501 --> 00:12:30,033
You just don't.
Who just says?

197
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:32,667
Everybody just says,
except you.

198
00:12:32,667 --> 00:12:33,801
That's who just says.

199
00:12:33,801 --> 00:12:35,000
Oh, everybody just says?

200
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,501
I don't think
everybody just says.

201
00:12:36,501 --> 00:12:38,367
You're a child,
you know that?

202
00:12:38,367 --> 00:12:40,334
Oh! Oh! All right,
well, then by your rules,

203
00:12:40,334 --> 00:12:42,367
I shouldn't be going
to the funeral, so...

204
00:12:43,501 --> 00:12:45,234
Let's not go.

205
00:12:55,067 --> 00:12:56,968
It was great.
It was really great.

206
00:12:56,968 --> 00:12:58,534
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

207
00:12:58,534 --> 00:13:00,734
Thank you.

208
00:13:00,734 --> 00:13:01,801
Hey.

209
00:13:01,801 --> 00:13:02,934
Hey.

210
00:13:04,534 --> 00:13:06,667
Hi, Beth.

211
00:13:07,601 --> 00:13:10,133
How you been doing?

212
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,200
I made you
a string-bean casserole.

213
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,200
I left it at your house.

214
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,400
Thank you, Beth,

215
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,200
but I think we should
stick with the original--

216
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,334
I-- I have to admit,
I called a couple times.

217
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:25,200
I'm bad.

218
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,267
I mean, it's not like
you pick up anyway, right?

219
00:13:27,267 --> 00:13:29,000
Yeah.

220
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,200
Oh, look,

221
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,100
you got a little something
in your eye there.

222
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,200
Yeah, I got it.
Thank you. Thank you.

223
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:36,534
Well, hey...

224
00:13:37,434 --> 00:13:38,667
Thanks for coming, Beth.

225
00:13:38,667 --> 00:13:40,667
Thank you very much.

226
00:13:43,067 --> 00:13:44,534
Nice that Beth came.

227
00:13:44,534 --> 00:13:46,167
Yeah...

228
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:47,501
Beth is nice.

229
00:13:50,434 --> 00:13:52,000
Shit.

230
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,067
What?

231
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:54,234
Shithead's here.

232
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:55,601
What the hell, Alan?

233
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:56,667
Gina, how are you?

234
00:13:56,667 --> 00:13:57,667
Get out.

235
00:13:57,667 --> 00:13:59,234
Jesus,
relax, Gina.

236
00:13:59,234 --> 00:14:00,667
I'm just here
to pay my respects.

237
00:14:00,667 --> 00:14:03,133
No. Get out. You're not part of
this family anymore, Alan.

238
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,868
We are not married
anymore. So...

239
00:14:04,868 --> 00:14:06,601
get out.

240
00:14:06,601 --> 00:14:08,133
I'm just--
You know,

241
00:14:08,133 --> 00:14:09,767
I just wanna
pay my respects, man.

242
00:14:09,767 --> 00:14:11,801
Fuck you, shithead.

243
00:14:24,601 --> 00:14:25,934
Fellas.

244
00:14:25,934 --> 00:14:27,100
Fuck you, shithead.

245
00:14:33,033 --> 00:14:35,067
Wow.

246
00:14:35,067 --> 00:14:37,000
She, uh, evolved.

247
00:14:39,634 --> 00:14:41,634
Let's get happy.

248
00:14:43,701 --> 00:14:45,234
Because it's important, Julie.

249
00:14:45,234 --> 00:14:47,534
Kids need to know,
at the end of life, people die.

250
00:14:47,534 --> 00:14:49,567
Babies, do you wanna
go to a funeral?

251
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:50,968
No.

252
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:54,367
Who wants to see a dead body?

253
00:14:54,367 --> 00:14:55,868
I do, I do. Me, me!
I do.

254
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:03,367
I'm so sorry.

255
00:15:03,367 --> 00:15:05,267
Yeah, me too.

256
00:15:05,267 --> 00:15:08,367
Yeah. Yeah.

257
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,100
It's just that death
is so fucking severe.

258
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,234
Mm.

259
00:15:13,234 --> 00:15:14,734
It's brutal.

260
00:15:16,534 --> 00:15:19,868
It's man's final fate, man.

261
00:15:19,868 --> 00:15:22,467
Fucker's grim.

262
00:15:22,467 --> 00:15:24,734
It's Byzantine.

263
00:15:24,734 --> 00:15:26,434
Byzantine?

264
00:15:26,434 --> 00:15:29,234
Complex? Layered?

265
00:15:30,501 --> 00:15:32,033
You know,
we're the only animal

266
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:34,400
that's conscious
of our own mortality.

267
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,434
Do you know how much
that fucks us up?

268
00:15:37,534 --> 00:15:39,467
You know, Bronowski said,

269
00:15:39,467 --> 00:15:41,868
"Every animal leaves traces
of what it was.

270
00:15:41,868 --> 00:15:45,200
Man alone leaves traces
of what he created. "

271
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,868
Who said that?

272
00:15:46,868 --> 00:15:48,734
Bronowski, the writer.

273
00:15:48,734 --> 00:15:50,133
Who cares?

274
00:15:50,133 --> 00:15:52,234
When you're dead, you're dead,
know what I mean?

275
00:15:52,234 --> 00:15:54,133
I zoned out in the middle,
but I do agree

276
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:56,100
with the "when you're dead,
you're dead" part.

277
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,133
Yeah.

278
00:15:57,133 --> 00:15:58,701
Hey. Ahem.

279
00:15:58,701 --> 00:16:00,033
You wanna?

280
00:16:00,033 --> 00:16:01,067
Oh.

281
00:16:01,067 --> 00:16:02,701
It's not a bad time
to be numb.

282
00:16:14,767 --> 00:16:17,133
All right.


283
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:21,801
Pick up your cans, Lozo.

284
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:23,767
Out, everybody out.
Out, out, out.

285
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:26,367
Let's go,
let's go, let's go.

286
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,133
Here, here.
Put this on.

287
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:31,934
Ties choke, no.

288
00:16:31,934 --> 00:16:33,601
Lozo.
No.

289
00:16:33,601 --> 00:16:35,701
Let's go,
triple time, let's go.

290
00:16:35,701 --> 00:16:39,000
Triple time.
Don't run. Don't run.

291
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,601
I'm walking
as fast as I can.

292
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:42,200
I'm saying
they shouldn't run.

293
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,834
Hey, let your sister
open the door.

294
00:16:43,834 --> 00:16:45,300
Over there, no noise.

295
00:16:45,300 --> 00:16:46,400
Can we see his guts?

296
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,934
You wanna see my belt?

297
00:16:49,534 --> 00:16:50,667
Go all the way
over there.

298
00:16:50,667 --> 00:16:52,167
Donna, please watch
your brothers.

299
00:16:56,734 --> 00:16:58,834
It's never good.
It's just never...

300
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:01,767
... good.

301
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:03,334
You brought your kids?

302
00:17:03,334 --> 00:17:05,534
Hi.

303
00:17:05,534 --> 00:17:06,567
Hey.

304
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,667
Thanks for coming.

305
00:17:07,667 --> 00:17:08,701
Oh, of course.

306
00:17:09,701 --> 00:17:11,601
Did they say
what happened?

307
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:12,767
Well,
his heart stopped,

308
00:17:12,767 --> 00:17:13,834
he fell in the water,

309
00:17:13,834 --> 00:17:15,601
but they don't know
what happened first.

310
00:17:15,601 --> 00:17:16,634
South Shell killed him.

311
00:17:16,634 --> 00:17:17,701
Oh, Frankie.

312
00:17:17,701 --> 00:17:20,133
No, they fucking...
killed him, man.

313
00:17:20,133 --> 00:17:22,601
He was out by himself. You can't
say South Shell killed him.

314
00:17:22,601 --> 00:17:23,901
I can say
whatever I want.

315
00:17:23,901 --> 00:17:25,434
I feel it, man.
I'm a young buck,

316
00:17:25,434 --> 00:17:27,267
and I'm in
my fucking prime.

317
00:17:27,267 --> 00:17:29,400
And I-- I feel
they're killing me.

318
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,400
I-I...

319
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,767
get what
you're saying, Loz,

320
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:34,234
But come on, this is the
old man's funeral, all right?

321
00:17:34,234 --> 00:17:36,200
No, I know. I'm--
I'm sorry, no disrespect.

322
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,968
I loved
your old man, okay?

323
00:17:37,968 --> 00:17:40,434
But it takes three days
to pull in a day's pay now,

324
00:17:40,434 --> 00:17:42,901
and you can't tell me that
those South Shell cocksuckers

325
00:17:42,901 --> 00:17:44,767
restricting our water's
got nothing to do

326
00:17:44,767 --> 00:17:46,501
with your old man
being in a box.

327
00:17:46,501 --> 00:17:48,000
Guys, guys, guys, guys...

328
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,601
No, hold on a second,
all right?

329
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,701
You don't see
the irony of it?

330
00:17:51,701 --> 00:17:53,968
It's fucking ironic
is what it is.

331
00:17:53,968 --> 00:17:55,968
What's ironic about it?

332
00:17:57,267 --> 00:17:58,701
You don't...

333
00:17:58,701 --> 00:17:59,701
see the irony?

334
00:17:59,701 --> 00:18:00,701
You don't...

335
00:18:00,701 --> 00:18:02,133
see the irony?

336
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:03,133
I'm trying to.

337
00:18:03,133 --> 00:18:05,267
Actually the true
definition of irony--

338
00:18:05,267 --> 00:18:07,200
Honestly, don't get wordy
with me right now.

339
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,701
Hey, it's not the time, Frankie.
Not the time.

340
00:18:09,701 --> 00:18:12,434
Yeah, man. Dull that edge.


341
00:18:12,434 --> 00:18:14,868
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't think so.

342
00:18:16,701 --> 00:18:19,400
Oh. Oh, really?
Okay, go ahead.

343
00:18:32,234 --> 00:18:33,601
I'm sorry.

344
00:18:45,167 --> 00:18:47,367
I didn't make his bed
that day.

345
00:18:47,367 --> 00:18:49,167
Oh,
that's all right.

346
00:18:49,167 --> 00:18:51,033
You can make it
tonight.

347
00:18:51,033 --> 00:18:52,167
Yeah.

348
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:56,934
Boots?

349
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,067
Why?

350
00:19:34,434 --> 00:19:38,167
<i>* Heyla ho, boys *</i>

351
00:19:38,167 --> 00:19:41,801
<i>* Let her go, boys *</i>

352
00:19:41,801 --> 00:19:45,334
<i>* Bring her head round *</i>

353
00:19:45,334 --> 00:19:48,767
<i>* Altogether *</i>

354
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:52,467
<i>* Heyla ho, boys *</i>

355
00:19:52,467 --> 00:19:56,067
<i>* Let her go, boys *</i>

356
00:19:56,067 --> 00:19:59,534
<i>* Sailing homeward *</i>

357
00:19:59,534 --> 00:20:02,033
<i>* To Mingulay *</i>

358
00:20:02,033 --> 00:20:03,367
Can you pick up Daddy's ashes?

359
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:05,100
I don't think I can
handle it right now.

360
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,701
It's taken care of.

361
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,734
What about his boat?

362
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,701
I'll sell it, or...

363
00:20:20,467 --> 00:20:22,734
I-I don't know.

364
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,167
You want me
to stay over?

365
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:26,167
No.

366
00:20:27,167 --> 00:20:28,934
No.

367
00:20:28,934 --> 00:20:32,434
I gotta get used
to being here alone sometime.

368
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:36,434
Okay.
Okay.

369
00:20:40,267 --> 00:20:41,901
Okay.

370
00:20:54,367 --> 00:20:56,434
I'll be okay too.

371
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,801
I'll be fine.

372
00:21:28,267 --> 00:21:30,033
Oh, God.

373
00:21:43,234 --> 00:21:45,434
<i>Good morning. 
Wanna Talk once again. </i>

374
00:21:45,434 --> 00:21:47,934
<i>It's Mark Spencer, and here's
the latest local news for you</i>

375
00:21:47,934 --> 00:21:49,400

376
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:50,734

<i>are suffering
from a rash of engine theft. </i>

378
00:21:53,133 --> 00:21:55,567
<i>So play it safe. 
Lock up, everybody. </i>

379
00:21:55,567 --> 00:21:57,634
<i>We interviewed longtime digger
Ed Wallace, </i>

380
00:21:57,634 --> 00:21:59,400
<i>and here's what
Ed had to say:</i>

381
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,400
<i>It's bad in the bay, 
it's bad at the docks. </i>

382
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,100
<i>Hello, ladies.
I can't leave my boat</i>

383
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,400
<i>without chaining up my engine. 
How you doing today?</i>

384
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,934
<i>Why? Everybody needs the money, </i>

385
00:22:07,934 --> 00:22:09,367
<i>so they do
what they gotta do. </i>

386
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:11,534
<i>But cutting out
an engine that's all locked up</i>

387
00:22:11,534 --> 00:22:12,834
<i>with a chainsaw?</i>

388
00:22:12,834 --> 00:22:14,200
<i>That's pretty low. </i>

389
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,667
<i>And in local news... </i>

390
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,200
It ain't getting
any cleaner, pal.

391
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,501
<i>The church is holding it's
annual fair and bake sale... </i>

392
00:22:20,501 --> 00:22:21,767

<i>This from our bulletin board... </i>

399
00:22:40,334 --> 00:22:43,067
Wait here a sec.

400
00:22:46,133 --> 00:22:47,767
Gina?

401
00:22:49,501 --> 00:22:50,634
Gina, what's going on?

402
00:22:50,634 --> 00:22:52,133
It's a piece of shit.

403
00:22:52,133 --> 00:22:54,234
I mean, why would
anybody wanna get inside?

404
00:22:54,234 --> 00:22:55,634
You know, they just--

405
00:22:55,634 --> 00:22:58,167
They just towed it here from
the dock, and he locked it up

406
00:22:58,167 --> 00:23:00,167
like someone would wanna
get inside, you know?

407
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:02,400
For what, right?
You know, and-- And-- And--

408
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,200
And then where did
the keys go?

409
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,467
I mean, where did the keys go,
you know?

410
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,200
Okay?

411
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,167
Yeah.

412
00:23:20,167 --> 00:23:21,734
You got a hanger?

413
00:23:21,734 --> 00:23:23,067
A hanger? Yeah.

414
00:23:23,067 --> 00:23:25,167
Cool. I'll open it up for you.

415
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:26,634
Yeah?

416
00:23:26,634 --> 00:23:27,601
Yeah.

417
00:23:40,901 --> 00:23:42,133
Oh, I helped
your sister

418
00:23:42,133 --> 00:23:43,934
break into your old man's
truck today.

419
00:23:43,934 --> 00:23:45,067
What?

420
00:23:45,067 --> 00:23:46,534
She was kicking
the door and shit.

421
00:23:46,534 --> 00:23:48,300
I took care of it.
Oh, Jesus, I forgot.

422
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,734
Ah, no problem.
Two seconds in and out.

423
00:23:50,734 --> 00:23:54,200
Ah. I knew there was a reason
to keep you around, angel eyes.

424
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:56,000
How's it hanging, A. P. ?

425
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,234
Look at that.
Not much today, huh?

426
00:23:58,234 --> 00:24:00,367
Oh, 500 count.

427
00:24:00,367 --> 00:24:01,701
Seems a little light.

428
00:24:01,701 --> 00:24:04,033
It's not.

429
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:07,567
Seems a little light.

430
00:24:07,567 --> 00:24:09,167
It's not, meatball.

431
00:24:10,901 --> 00:24:12,801
Un-fucking-believable.

432
00:24:12,801 --> 00:24:14,734
So I don't pay rent
this month.

433
00:24:17,334 --> 00:24:19,934
You know they leased everything
north of West Creek?

434
00:24:19,934 --> 00:24:21,901
The beds are all
dried up west of here.

435
00:24:21,901 --> 00:24:24,734
I backtracked today to see
if I had any luck closer in.

436
00:24:26,434 --> 00:24:27,767
Sixty-five?

437
00:24:27,767 --> 00:24:30,167
It's-- It's practically
a brand-new engine.

438
00:24:30,167 --> 00:24:32,601
Yeah, well, you--

439
00:24:32,601 --> 00:24:34,934
You're banging me over
the head-- If I can't--

440
00:24:34,934 --> 00:24:36,934
I gotta go out there
and work and make money,

441
00:24:36,934 --> 00:24:39,300
so I can pay you,
you fucking rapist.

442
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,968
Four o'clock?

443
00:24:41,968 --> 00:24:43,000
Okay.

444
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,334
Four o'clock.

445
00:24:45,334 --> 00:24:47,567
Can I finish now?
Oh, please.

446
00:24:47,567 --> 00:24:49,267
If there are beds of clams
in that area--

447
00:24:49,267 --> 00:24:50,767
It's restricted,
Julie.

448
00:24:50,767 --> 00:24:53,801
South Shell restricts that area.
It's their area now.

449
00:24:53,801 --> 00:24:56,167
I don't understand why you can't
just drift the boat over

450
00:24:56,167 --> 00:24:58,534
this invisible line
and just dig there.

451
00:24:58,534 --> 00:24:59,634
Because it's--
On the outskirts.

452
00:24:59,634 --> 00:25:00,834
Because it's illegal!

453
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,601
How are we gonna pay
for another $200 ticket?

454
00:25:04,601 --> 00:25:06,334
You're so fucking thick.
Hey.

455
00:25:08,133 --> 00:25:10,934
What're you doing? Your finger's
broken? You're a cripple?

456
00:25:10,934 --> 00:25:12,601
No.

457
00:25:12,601 --> 00:25:14,968
Then put the pennies
in the fucking thing.

458
00:25:14,968 --> 00:25:16,634
I'm doing it, Daddy.

459
00:25:16,634 --> 00:25:18,734
See? Your sister's doing it.
Good girl, Donna.

460
00:25:18,734 --> 00:25:21,100
See? She's not a cripple.
Hey.

461
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,300
So, what, are they out there
all the time or what?

462
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:24,801
I can't, Julie.
Come on.

463
00:25:24,801 --> 00:25:26,868
I get one more ticket,
they take my license away.

464
00:25:26,868 --> 00:25:28,901
They take my license away,
I can't work.

465
00:25:28,901 --> 00:25:30,767
I don't work,
no groceries, no groceries.

466
00:25:30,767 --> 00:25:33,033
The kids start dropping off
like fucking--

467
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:34,801
We're living in Africa.

468
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:37,534
All right? So please,
stop it, all right?

469
00:25:37,534 --> 00:25:39,434
You're driving me
fucking nuts.

470
00:25:39,434 --> 00:25:41,133
Fucking nuts.

471
00:25:41,133 --> 00:25:43,234
I will wash that
mouth out with soap.
Language.

472
00:25:44,534 --> 00:25:45,968
I can't do this.

473
00:25:45,968 --> 00:25:47,267
What?

474
00:25:47,267 --> 00:25:49,133
You can't?

475
00:25:49,133 --> 00:25:50,801
You can't?

476
00:25:50,801 --> 00:25:52,634
All right,
go outside and play.

477
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:54,767
Fine, I'll do it.
No, no, no, no.

478
00:25:54,767 --> 00:25:57,367
Go outside and play,
all right?

479
00:25:57,367 --> 00:26:00,501
Go have fun, outside.
All of you, Jesus Christ.

480
00:26:00,501 --> 00:26:01,667
All of you, outside, play.

481
00:26:01,667 --> 00:26:03,100
Hey, take it easy,
Frankie.

482
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,367
Don't tell me to take it easy.

483
00:26:04,367 --> 00:26:06,501
He doesn't wanna help
his father roll pennies,

484
00:26:06,501 --> 00:26:07,934
he can go outside and play!

485
00:26:10,868 --> 00:26:12,634
I'll do it myself.

486
00:26:14,868 --> 00:26:17,067
In front of the kids,
you tell me to break the law.

487
00:26:17,067 --> 00:26:18,300
What are you talking about?

488
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,200
I'm just suggesting
that maybe

489
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:21,868
you drift near
the restricted area.

490
00:26:21,868 --> 00:26:24,734
You drop anchor, you pull up
a couple of rakefuls.

491
00:26:24,734 --> 00:26:27,100
Conservation comes by,
you just play dumb.

492
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,734
Right, right, right. Because
it's not illegal to be dumb.

493
00:26:30,734 --> 00:26:32,601
Right? Prisons are filled
with geniuses.

494
00:26:32,601 --> 00:26:34,334
Albert Einstein Penitentiary.

495
00:26:37,267 --> 00:26:38,734
Move.

496
00:27:20,567 --> 00:27:22,367
Oh.

497
00:27:22,367 --> 00:27:24,601
Hey. What are you doing?

498
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:26,100
No.

499
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:27,100
No!

500
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:28,734
Shit.

501
00:27:28,734 --> 00:27:30,200
Please turn around,
go back.

502
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,200
What? Why?

503
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,934
No, don't talk.

504
00:27:32,934 --> 00:27:35,400
Oh. Why are you
doing this?

505
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,868
I'm coming over 'cause we've
been looking at each other.

506
00:27:37,868 --> 00:27:38,868
I thought maybe--

507
00:27:38,868 --> 00:27:40,000
Looking not talking.

508
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,367
You ruined it.

509
00:27:41,367 --> 00:27:42,701
Ruined what?

510
00:27:44,567 --> 00:27:47,100
Our silent flirtation.

511
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,000
I didn't ruin anything.

512
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:52,200
Oh, see? Now we're having
our first fight.

513
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,567
You're kidding, right?

514
00:27:54,567 --> 00:27:56,434
Look, we had
a nice thing going on.

515
00:27:56,434 --> 00:27:59,734
You know, you'd pass by,
and we would look at each other.

516
00:28:01,033 --> 00:28:02,834
It was nice.

517
00:28:02,834 --> 00:28:04,501
You ruined it.

518
00:28:05,501 --> 00:28:07,067
God, it was so good!

519
00:28:07,067 --> 00:28:08,400
Why'd you do that?!

520
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:11,334
What the hell was that?

521
00:28:11,334 --> 00:28:13,133
<i>Lemme ask you something. </i>

522
00:28:13,133 --> 00:28:16,467
How can you work for them, man?
Like a fucking Stepford Wife.

523
00:28:16,467 --> 00:28:18,901
Hey, I got
a family to feed.

524
00:28:18,901 --> 00:28:20,234
I gotta have
security.

525
00:28:21,601 --> 00:28:24,067
South Shell
equals security.

526
00:28:24,067 --> 00:28:25,868
You're muscling us out, man.

527
00:28:25,868 --> 00:28:27,434
I'm not muscling shit.

528
00:28:27,434 --> 00:28:29,234
Just keeping it
above water.

529
00:28:29,234 --> 00:28:31,167
You should think
about going over there.

530
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:33,267
Me? No. I don't deal
with the devil.

531
00:28:33,267 --> 00:28:36,133
Who do you think
just paid for this lid?

532
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:38,834
Catch you on the flip side.
Thanks.

533
00:28:38,834 --> 00:28:41,601
Yeah, yeah.
And really...

534
00:28:41,601 --> 00:28:42,934
Think about it, Cons.

535
00:28:42,934 --> 00:28:45,667
It was a business
selling pleasure to you.

536
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:50,200
See you at
the company picnic, prick.

537
00:28:58,934 --> 00:29:01,834
Try stealing that.

538
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,167
You want freedom?

539
00:29:42,167 --> 00:29:45,501
Okay. You, you, you.

540
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,400
Corner of my eye,
I thought that was your hand.

541
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,434
What, this?

542
00:30:37,434 --> 00:30:39,067
Yeah, it looked
like you had this...

543
00:30:39,067 --> 00:30:41,200
big black fuckin'...

544
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,367
box hand.

545
00:30:48,868 --> 00:30:51,400
"Can't catch clams
with a camera. "

546
00:30:52,734 --> 00:30:54,467
No wonder you
haven't had any luck.

547
00:30:54,467 --> 00:30:55,701
We've all been
using rakes.

548
00:30:55,701 --> 00:30:56,634
Mm.

549
00:30:57,834 --> 00:30:59,400
Ah, that's what my old man
used to say

550
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:02,133
every time I'd give
him one of these.

551
00:31:02,133 --> 00:31:04,167
Right before he threw it
in the garbage.

552
00:31:05,968 --> 00:31:07,834
Don't take this
the wrong way, but...

553
00:31:07,834 --> 00:31:09,167
your old man was a prick.

554
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,701
How could I take that
the wrong way?

555
00:31:11,701 --> 00:31:13,968
No, he w.

556
00:31:13,968 --> 00:31:15,501
It's a good thing.

557
00:31:15,501 --> 00:31:18,000
He was one of those old pricks
that define this place.

558
00:31:18,968 --> 00:31:20,434
Can I make
an observation?

559
00:31:20,434 --> 00:31:23,667
Are you gonna
call my mom an asshole?

560
00:31:23,667 --> 00:31:25,234
You're not happy.

561
00:31:26,734 --> 00:31:28,868
My dad just died.

562
00:31:28,868 --> 00:31:32,133
I know that,
but even before.

563
00:31:32,133 --> 00:31:34,167
I've never seen you happy.

564
00:31:34,167 --> 00:31:35,934
No, I take that back.

565
00:31:35,934 --> 00:31:38,133
I've seen you happy,
but never content.

566
00:31:38,133 --> 00:31:39,834
You ever think
about splittin'?

567
00:31:39,834 --> 00:31:41,868
Oh, give me a break.

568
00:31:41,868 --> 00:31:44,501
I gotta take care of Gina...

569
00:31:44,501 --> 00:31:47,567
and his boat, fuckin' boat.

570
00:31:47,567 --> 00:31:49,601
So sell it.

571
00:31:49,601 --> 00:31:51,868
Who's gonna buy
that piece of shit?

572
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:54,100
It barely even floats.

573
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:56,501
Floating's important
for a boat.

574
00:31:56,501 --> 00:31:58,501
Sell it and go.

575
00:31:58,501 --> 00:32:02,000
Where am I gonna go, huh?
Nah, come on.

576
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,334
Leaving here right now
would be a big mistake.

577
00:32:05,334 --> 00:32:07,434
You know what they say:

578
00:32:07,434 --> 00:32:10,400
Mistakes are the portals
of discovery.

579
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,501
Fuckers.

580
00:32:57,901 --> 00:32:59,000
Hello?

581
00:33:00,968 --> 00:33:02,467
You need what?

582
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,667
Right now?

583
00:33:07,901 --> 00:33:09,400
Are you serious?

584
00:33:32,834 --> 00:33:34,400
<i>Mm, little bit to the left. </i>

585
00:33:35,934 --> 00:33:37,400
Yeah.

586
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,434
No. No, no, no, no. No.

587
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:41,534
Okay, hold it.

588
00:33:41,534 --> 00:33:43,167
Right up here.

589
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:44,634
Oh!

590
00:33:44,634 --> 00:33:46,767
Oh, that's-- Yeah.

591
00:33:46,767 --> 00:33:49,067
Yeah. Right, like that.

592
00:33:49,067 --> 00:33:51,000
Ah. Wait.

593
00:33:52,534 --> 00:33:53,901
Right like that.

594
00:34:22,834 --> 00:34:23,834
That was a good one.

595
00:34:25,968 --> 00:34:28,501
Hey, I just did
what you told me to do.

596
00:34:28,501 --> 00:34:29,934
Hell, it worked.

597
00:34:35,801 --> 00:34:38,834
Hey, are you on the pill
or something?

598
00:34:38,834 --> 00:34:40,334
You got that covered?

599
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,801
Not a problem.

600
00:34:48,868 --> 00:34:51,901
So are you okay?

601
00:34:51,901 --> 00:34:52,934
I am now.

602
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:02,567
Hey.

603
00:35:03,767 --> 00:35:05,000
Hey.

604
00:35:06,267 --> 00:35:07,501
What're you doin' here?

605
00:35:08,701 --> 00:35:10,234
Uh...

606
00:35:10,234 --> 00:35:12,767
The hot-water heater went out,
Gina gave me a call.

607
00:35:12,767 --> 00:35:14,934
I swung by, lit the pilot--

608
00:35:14,934 --> 00:35:17,100
She said it was
an emergency.

609
00:35:17,100 --> 00:35:19,167
I wonder why
she didn't call me.

610
00:35:19,167 --> 00:35:23,634
She said that she... had
trouble gettin' ahold of you.

611
00:35:23,634 --> 00:35:26,000
Wh-why aren't you
still out there?

612
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,701
It's like fishing for donuts.

613
00:35:27,701 --> 00:35:28,701
Hey.

614
00:35:28,701 --> 00:35:30,100
She's, uh--

615
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,334
She's taking a nap.
She was pretty beat.

616
00:35:46,734 --> 00:35:47,868
Gina.

617
00:35:51,133 --> 00:35:52,234
Gina.

618
00:35:52,234 --> 00:35:54,701
There he is.

619
00:35:54,701 --> 00:35:56,400
Jack told me
you were sleeping.

620
00:36:11,868 --> 00:36:13,434
Smells like Daddy.

621
00:36:17,334 --> 00:36:18,968
Did you pick up his ashes?

622
00:36:21,534 --> 00:36:23,300
Uh, no.

623
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,701
I'll do it.
I'll do it.

624
00:36:28,334 --> 00:36:30,567
Look at
that angel.

625
00:36:30,567 --> 00:36:31,601
And then there's this.

626
00:36:31,601 --> 00:36:33,334
Ah, yes.

627
00:36:33,334 --> 00:36:36,334
Uh-huh. What do you think?

628
00:36:36,334 --> 00:36:37,901
There are no pictures
of me here.

629
00:36:37,901 --> 00:36:40,033
Well, Mom and Dad
never cared for you much.

630
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,634
Whoa.

631
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,501
Daddy was
a dirty old man.

632
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:54,934
Oh, come on, don't judge.

633
00:36:54,934 --> 00:36:56,968
Mom was gone.
People get lonely.

634
00:36:58,834 --> 00:37:03,234
Yeah, this magazine is dated
two years before she died.

635
00:37:03,234 --> 00:37:05,367
I remember
the day before she died,

636
00:37:05,367 --> 00:37:08,067
she taught me how
to make Dad's coffee.

637
00:37:08,067 --> 00:37:09,200
Black, three sugars.

638
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,667
"Don't forget the sugars. "

639
00:37:10,667 --> 00:37:12,334
I know, he could
never make it himself.

640
00:37:12,334 --> 00:37:13,334
He always screwed it up.

641
00:37:13,334 --> 00:37:14,901
"Too fucking sweet. "

642
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,834
She always
took care of him.

643
00:37:18,834 --> 00:37:19,901
Took care of everybody.

644
00:37:19,901 --> 00:37:20,834
Mm-hm.

645
00:37:23,767 --> 00:37:27,033
Is it terrible that I miss Mom
more than I miss Dad?

646
00:37:33,067 --> 00:37:35,200
No.

647
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:36,634
It's not terrible.

648
00:38:54,868 --> 00:38:56,133
Unbelievable.

649
00:38:58,634 --> 00:39:00,067
How long has it been?

650
00:39:00,067 --> 00:39:02,100
Microphones went out
20 minutes ago.

651
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,968
They're just
standing there.

652
00:39:04,968 --> 00:39:06,834
How great is that?

653
00:39:06,834 --> 00:39:07,834
Whoever talks first,

654
00:39:07,834 --> 00:39:09,467
I'm voting for the other guy.

655
00:39:11,367 --> 00:39:14,901
All right, focus, focus.

656
00:39:14,901 --> 00:39:17,033
Which hole
am I aiming for?

657
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,767
You're a poet.

658
00:39:20,801 --> 00:39:24,000
Ah. Two points.

659
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,501
Do you understand
the rules of this game?

660
00:39:26,501 --> 00:39:27,501
Is that--?

661
00:39:27,501 --> 00:39:29,000
Yeah. In the flesh.

662
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,634
You're a strange
fuckin' bird.

663
00:39:35,267 --> 00:39:36,334
Here we go.

664
00:39:38,067 --> 00:39:39,868
What? Know how much
he charges

665
00:39:39,868 --> 00:39:41,000
for a shot of Wild Turkey?

666
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,000
It's fucking rape.

667
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,167
I didn't say anything.

668
00:39:43,167 --> 00:39:44,701
I got seven mouths to feed.

669
00:39:44,701 --> 00:39:45,834
You had another one?

670
00:39:45,834 --> 00:39:47,133
Bite your fuckin' tongue.

671
00:39:51,067 --> 00:39:52,367
You know you can
always borrow

672
00:39:52,367 --> 00:39:53,634
my old man's boat
if you want.

673
00:39:53,634 --> 00:39:55,100
I mean, before I sell it.

674
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,968
I've got room on my ship

675
00:39:56,968 --> 00:40:00,601
if you wanna jump aboard
for a couple of days, captain.

676
00:40:00,601 --> 00:40:02,901
I'd rather eat my own asshole,
but thanks.

677
00:40:02,901 --> 00:40:03,968
Oh, that's fucked up.

678
00:40:03,968 --> 00:40:05,667
Put that on a mantel,
you wack-job.

679
00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:07,434
I can't,
we're playing doubles.

680
00:40:08,968 --> 00:40:10,267
To my old man.

681
00:40:10,267 --> 00:40:11,868
To your old man.

682
00:40:11,868 --> 00:40:13,934
Old man.
To your old man.

683
00:40:13,934 --> 00:40:15,601
So finish.
Well...

684
00:40:15,601 --> 00:40:17,901
first I stopped
at Waldbaums...

685
00:40:17,901 --> 00:40:20,200
'cause they were having a sale
on pork chops that day.

686
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:21,501
It's funny
what you remember.

687
00:40:21,501 --> 00:40:23,367
I don't usually buy
pork chops there.

688
00:40:23,367 --> 00:40:24,868
They're overpriced
at Waldbaums.

689
00:40:24,868 --> 00:40:27,801
Yeah, usually,
but not that day.

690
00:40:27,801 --> 00:40:29,200
And Alan loves pork chops,

691
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,767
so I thought I'd make
a nice dinner for him.

692
00:40:32,767 --> 00:40:34,534
I walk in the door...

693
00:40:34,534 --> 00:40:36,667
and the first thing I see

694
00:40:36,667 --> 00:40:40,467
is Alan's pale white ass

695
00:40:40,467 --> 00:40:42,434
going up and down

696
00:40:42,434 --> 00:40:44,567
on top of Connie Zito.

697
00:40:45,267 --> 00:40:46,534
He's humping her

698
00:40:46,534 --> 00:40:48,801
on the Formica kitchen table
my grandmother gave us.

699
00:40:48,801 --> 00:40:50,801
Big Connie Zito,
"from next door" Connie Zito?

700
00:40:50,801 --> 00:40:52,033
Yeah, across the street.

701
00:40:52,033 --> 00:40:53,968
You're so much
prettier than her. Right?

702
00:40:53,968 --> 00:40:56,234
So he doesn't
even hear me.

703
00:40:56,234 --> 00:40:58,300
And I'm watching 'em
for what seems like an hour,

704
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,567
which could not be the case
'cause Alan's never lasted

705
00:41:00,567 --> 00:41:02,400
more than a minute
in his life.

706
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:05,133
So... they hump, and I watch,
and they hump.

707
00:41:05,133 --> 00:41:08,200
And then finally Connie Zito
sees me, and she screams.

708
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:11,434
And Alan thinks
he's doing something right.

709
00:41:11,434 --> 00:41:12,567
So she's jiggling her ass,

710
00:41:12,567 --> 00:41:14,234
trying to get out
from underneath him.

711
00:41:14,234 --> 00:41:15,100
But it's too late.

712
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,834
He can'

713
00:41:17,901 --> 00:41:19,501
Oh, you've gotta
be kidding.

714
00:41:19,501 --> 00:41:22,934
And as the words,
"It's not what you think, "

715
00:41:22,934 --> 00:41:24,467
come spilling
out of his mouth,

716
00:41:24,467 --> 00:41:27,868
he is unloading
all over the Formica.

717
00:41:29,467 --> 00:41:31,834
And then Connie Zito
put her pants on backwards.

718
00:41:31,834 --> 00:41:33,834
And he says,

719
00:41:33,834 --> 00:41:35,767
"Honey, don't do this. "

720
00:41:35,767 --> 00:41:36,868
Oh, he's putting it on you?

721
00:41:36,868 --> 00:41:38,434
Well, that's very nice.

722
00:41:38,434 --> 00:41:42,300
I just told him
very politely to...

723
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:45,467
clean himself
off my Formica,

724
00:41:45,467 --> 00:41:47,200
put his brain
back in his pocket

725
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:48,868
and get out of my house.

726
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,234
And then I gave
Connie Zito the pork chops.

727
00:41:55,234 --> 00:41:57,400
I told her to, uh...

728
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,934
take 'em home to her husband

729
00:41:58,934 --> 00:42:01,801
and try not
to overcook them.

730
00:42:01,801 --> 00:42:03,901
<i>* Baby, there's a place
I know *</i>

731
00:42:03,901 --> 00:42:07,367
<i>* That old dog
You've just gotta go *</i>

732
00:42:07,367 --> 00:42:10,501
<i>* It's over
On the other side *</i>

733
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:16,934
<i>* Beyond the mountain
That's oh so high *</i>

734
00:42:16,934 --> 00:42:19,868
<i>* So come on, go with me *</i>

735
00:42:19,868 --> 00:42:22,467
<i>* We're makin' love... *</i>

736
00:42:23,634 --> 00:42:24,801
We'll be right back.

737
00:42:24,801 --> 00:42:25,801
<i>* Love *</i>

738
00:42:25,801 --> 00:42:28,634
<i>* Love, love, love *</i>

739
00:42:28,634 --> 00:42:33,067
<i>* Baby, I wanna
Go with you *</i>

740
00:42:33,067 --> 00:42:38,033
<i>* To find your mountain
That's oh so high *</i>

741
00:42:38,033 --> 00:42:41,934
<i>* And I've been waiting
A long, long time *</i>

742
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,167
<i>* To find out what's
On the other side... *</i>

743
00:42:44,167 --> 00:42:46,701
Mm, you going
on a picnic?

744
00:42:46,701 --> 00:42:47,701
Oh, this.

745
00:42:48,701 --> 00:42:49,834
No.

746
00:42:49,834 --> 00:42:51,934
<i>* We're making love *</i>

747
00:42:51,934 --> 00:42:55,033
<i>* Love, love, love *</i>

748
00:42:55,033 --> 00:42:56,033
<i>* Baby *</i>

749
00:42:56,033 --> 00:42:59,467
<i>* Love, love, love *</i>

750
00:42:59,467 --> 00:43:03,567
<i>* There'll be lots of things
That we can do *</i>

751
00:43:04,534 --> 00:43:06,234
Jesus, finally.

752
00:43:10,434 --> 00:43:11,801
Darts?
Yeah.

753
00:43:11,801 --> 00:43:12,801
So...

754
00:43:12,801 --> 00:43:14,133
I'm sleeping
with him.

755
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,968
Him who?

756
00:43:15,968 --> 00:43:18,701
Him... Jack.

757
00:43:28,667 --> 00:43:30,334
Oh.
Yeah.

758
00:43:31,434 --> 00:43:32,434
Great.

759
00:43:35,767 --> 00:43:38,801
The city was just
getting too crazy.

760
00:43:38,801 --> 00:43:42,133
So I decided
to run away

761
00:43:42,133 --> 00:43:44,734
to my uncle's house
for a little while,

762
00:43:44,734 --> 00:43:46,501
breathe some
clean air.

763
00:44:12,901 --> 00:44:14,767
I gotta let it cook.

764
00:44:17,868 --> 00:44:19,033
Mood lighting?

765
00:44:19,033 --> 00:44:20,467
I'm in a light mood.

766
00:44:20,467 --> 00:44:21,400
Oh.

767
00:44:24,267 --> 00:44:27,501
Sorry I couldn't see your dad
off the other day.

768
00:44:29,701 --> 00:44:30,634
Those are on me.

769
00:44:34,934 --> 00:44:37,300
I gotta show you how to eat
these things the right way.

770
00:44:37,300 --> 00:44:39,834
You like it
with a little kick?

771
00:44:39,834 --> 00:44:41,567
I don't know yet.

772
00:44:42,834 --> 00:44:45,000
This is the Mick Jagger.
Right, it's the--

773
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,968
The flavor,
the flash, the bite.

774
00:44:46,968 --> 00:44:49,567
This is the soul,

775
00:44:49,567 --> 00:44:51,667
the foundation
from which we build,

776
00:44:51,667 --> 00:44:52,667
the Keith Richards.

777
00:44:52,667 --> 00:44:53,667
Stones fan, are you?

778
00:44:53,667 --> 00:44:54,734
Never heard of 'em.
Mm.

779
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:57,601
So here's what you do,
is you mix it up.

780
00:44:57,601 --> 00:44:59,534
And then you put
a little bit of Mick

781
00:44:59,534 --> 00:45:01,167
on a little bit
of Keith.

782
00:45:01,167 --> 00:45:03,067
Wouldn't be the first time
that's happened.

783
00:45:11,267 --> 00:45:12,467
Mm.

784
00:45:12,467 --> 00:45:14,200
Mmm.

785
00:45:14,200 --> 00:45:15,133
Good.

786
00:45:18,801 --> 00:45:19,734
All right.

787
00:45:34,167 --> 00:45:35,400
Oh, my God.

788
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,400
Hey!

789
00:45:41,567 --> 00:45:43,167
It's an acquired taste.

790
00:45:44,367 --> 00:45:46,601
So for the first time,

791
00:45:46,601 --> 00:45:48,801
I realized that my needs
are important.

792
00:45:48,801 --> 00:45:51,000
You know? Sexually.

793
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,734
It's not
a selfish thing.

794
00:45:52,734 --> 00:45:55,033
Um... more power to ya.

795
00:45:55,033 --> 00:45:57,367
How often does Frankie
go down on you?

796
00:45:57,367 --> 00:46:00,901
Oh, Gina, I'm not comfortable
talking about that.

797
00:46:00,901 --> 00:46:02,467
See? He doesn't, does he?

798
00:46:02,467 --> 00:46:04,901
Don't patronize me,
seriously.

799
00:46:04,901 --> 00:46:05,968
I'm not patronizing you.

800
00:46:05,968 --> 00:46:08,300
Here, hold the baby.

801
00:46:08,300 --> 00:46:10,934
Yeah, I think
I like clams.

802
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:11,901
Yeah?

803
00:46:13,901 --> 00:46:15,434
I think I like you.

804
00:46:16,868 --> 00:46:19,601
You hardly know me.

805
00:46:19,601 --> 00:46:21,501
You hardly know clams.

806
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:26,601
At some point you're gonna
tell me your name, right?

807
00:46:28,667 --> 00:46:29,801
Zoey.

808
00:46:33,167 --> 00:46:35,133
Hm.

809
00:46:35,133 --> 00:46:37,067
I'm sorry about
your father, Hunt.

810
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,601
Thank you, Zoey.

811
00:46:44,567 --> 00:46:46,334
I can't believe--
I'm not--

812
00:46:48,334 --> 00:46:50,133
What are you two girls
talkin' about?

813
00:46:50,133 --> 00:46:51,300
Nothing.

814
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:53,300
What?
Sex.

815
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:54,501
You know what?

816
00:46:54,501 --> 00:46:56,400
I don't wanna hear about
that shit right now.

817
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,067
Why don't you go
stand over there, then?

818
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,501
We're leaving.
Hey, Frankie?

819
00:47:02,501 --> 00:47:05,968
Gina says they might be looking
for workers at South Shell.

820
00:47:05,968 --> 00:47:07,968
South Shell.

821
00:47:07,968 --> 00:47:10,267
I heard maybe
they were hiring.

822
00:47:10,267 --> 00:47:11,534
All right,
we're going home.

823
00:47:11,534 --> 00:47:12,701
I don't wanna
piss Mom off.

824
00:47:12,701 --> 00:47:15,467
Oh, God forbid we should
piss off your mother.

825
00:47:15,467 --> 00:47:16,701
Good night.

826
00:47:16,701 --> 00:47:17,701
Hey, if you need a ride

827
00:47:17,701 --> 00:47:19,100
on my ride tomorrow,
let me know.

828
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,501
If I need a bullet to the head,
I'll let you know too.

829
00:47:34,367 --> 00:47:35,367
All right.

830
00:47:39,434 --> 00:47:40,467
Good night.

831
00:47:51,901 --> 00:47:54,567
Do you really
like me, Jack?

832
00:47:54,567 --> 00:47:55,901
Yes.

833
00:47:57,667 --> 00:48:00,267
I bet you say that
to all the girls.

834
00:48:01,834 --> 00:48:03,167
Yes.

835
00:48:04,901 --> 00:48:07,434
But I'm different, right?

836
00:48:07,434 --> 00:48:09,667
Yes.

837
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:19,868
<i>* Won't you let me
Walk you home from school? *</i>

838
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:31,100
<i>* Won't you let me
Meet you at the pool? *</i>

839
00:48:33,434 --> 00:48:35,200
You got a little, um...

840
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:37,367
<i>* Maybe Friday I can *</i>

841
00:48:37,367 --> 00:48:41,734
<i>* Get tickets for the dance? *</i>

842
00:48:43,701 --> 00:48:49,234
<i>* And I'll take you *</i>

843
00:48:50,567 --> 00:48:52,634
<i>* Ooh-ooh *</i>

844
00:48:56,234 --> 00:49:00,901
<i>* Won't you tell your dad
"Get off my back"? *</i>

845
00:49:04,367 --> 00:49:08,634
<i>* Tell him what we said
'Bout "Paint It Black" *</i>

846
00:49:09,901 --> 00:49:11,501
Come on. Motherfucker!

847
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:15,968
Motherfucker.
Motherfucker.

848
00:49:15,968 --> 00:49:17,200
Motherfucker!

849
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,634
Is every engine retarded
in this fuckin' town?

850
00:49:21,934 --> 00:49:23,801
Come on, man.

851
00:49:23,801 --> 00:49:26,100
Solidarity.

852
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:29,400
If we get one more onboard,
we can be an organization.

853
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:31,868
We can sing it
in three-part harmony.

854
00:49:31,868 --> 00:49:35,000
We get 50 onboard,
we can be a movement.

855
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,634
* Exceptin' Alice *

856
00:49:38,934 --> 00:49:40,667
I just took
some acid.

857
00:49:46,767 --> 00:49:47,834
Whoa.

858
00:49:51,901 --> 00:49:54,133
Woo! Woo.

859
00:49:58,567 --> 00:49:59,968
The opinion of the majority

860
00:49:59,968 --> 00:50:02,100
shouldn't be equated
to the truth.

861
00:50:03,234 --> 00:50:05,200
Have you met
my new little friend?

862
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,667
I call him...

863
00:50:07,667 --> 00:50:09,434
Winston.

864
00:50:09,434 --> 00:50:12,567
This is Lozo. Lozo, Winston.
Winston's a living thing.

865
00:50:12,567 --> 00:50:15,167
And without even blinking
an eye, we kill thousands

866
00:50:15,167 --> 00:50:18,167
and thousands upon thousands
of Winstons a day, man.

867
00:50:18,167 --> 00:50:20,601
Why? Because the majority
says it's okay,

868
00:50:20,601 --> 00:50:22,133
which somehow makes it truth.

869
00:50:22,133 --> 00:50:24,300
But I say bullshit, brother.
Bullshit.

870
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:25,901
Just 'cause
everybody's doing it,

871
00:50:25,901 --> 00:50:28,067
just 'cause it's status quo
doesn't make it truth.

872
00:50:28,067 --> 00:50:30,467
I'm not trying to get all high
and mighty here. I'm just...

873
00:50:30,467 --> 00:50:32,868
Right, you know, Darwinism.
Sure, okay. I--

874
00:50:32,868 --> 00:50:34,334
Whoa.

875
00:50:34,334 --> 00:50:37,100
Now, I'm just trying to say,
Winston here

876
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,934
represents to me, at least,

877
00:50:38,934 --> 00:50:41,501
man's disregard for life.

878
00:50:41,501 --> 00:50:43,367
What, there's not
enough food in the world?

879
00:50:43,367 --> 00:50:45,767
We gotta eat
these living things?

880
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,400
Oh, that's fucked up, man.

881
00:51:07,467 --> 00:51:08,534
Spread your legs.

882
00:51:08,534 --> 00:51:09,801
Mm-hmm.

883
00:51:09,801 --> 00:51:11,267
Rock back and forth.

884
00:51:12,834 --> 00:51:14,234
Feel that?
Yeah.

885
00:51:15,567 --> 00:51:16,801
That's right?

886
00:51:16,801 --> 00:51:18,267
Yeah.

887
00:51:18,267 --> 00:51:19,634
This is it?

888
00:51:19,634 --> 00:51:21,033
Well, kind of.

889
00:51:21,033 --> 00:51:23,634
This has nothing to do
with clamming at this point.

890
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:35,234
Yep.

891
00:51:35,234 --> 00:51:36,434
That's terrible.

892
00:51:38,701 --> 00:51:41,434
You know, New York,
I never been to your city.

893
00:51:41,434 --> 00:51:43,367
What?

894
00:51:43,367 --> 00:51:46,267
You live an hour out, and
you've never been to Manhattan?

895
00:51:46,267 --> 00:51:48,734
No, I'm from the Island.
We don't go to the city.

896
00:51:48,734 --> 00:51:50,300
Crazy people
out there with guns.

897
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:52,234
That is not true.

898
00:51:52,234 --> 00:51:55,033
Well, I'd like to believe you,
but you're one of the crazies.

899
00:51:55,033 --> 00:51:57,367
Oh-- Well, thing is,
we know we're crazy.

900
00:52:02,734 --> 00:52:05,267
My mother
used to like the city.

901
00:52:05,267 --> 00:52:07,601
Yeah. How is she doing?

902
00:52:07,601 --> 00:52:09,200
She died
when I was 12.

903
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,067
Oh.

904
00:52:11,067 --> 00:52:13,300
Yeah. She said she wanted
to take me when I got older,

905
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,934
but then she got sick.

906
00:52:14,934 --> 00:52:16,601
Hey, I don't know
if you know this,

907
00:52:16,601 --> 00:52:18,100
but this is
how I get women.

908
00:52:18,100 --> 00:52:19,868
I talk about
my dead parents.

909
00:52:53,667 --> 00:52:56,067
Yeah, I don't know about that.

910
00:52:56,067 --> 00:52:58,601
I guess I just feel
like if I left here,

911
00:52:58,601 --> 00:52:59,601
I would...

912
00:52:59,601 --> 00:53:00,601
I don't know...

913
00:53:00,601 --> 00:53:01,901
never come back.

914
00:53:03,133 --> 00:53:04,868
The train goes both ways.

915
00:53:06,367 --> 00:53:08,934
Yeah, well...

916
00:53:33,067 --> 00:53:34,868
These are good.

917
00:53:36,334 --> 00:53:37,501
Yeah?

918
00:53:37,501 --> 00:53:39,367
Mm.

919
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,834
There's no faces in them.

920
00:53:42,834 --> 00:53:45,501
You don't like to
take pictures of people?

921
00:53:45,501 --> 00:53:47,601
I like taking pictures
of things.

922
00:53:47,601 --> 00:53:49,767
It's easier.
They don't move.

923
00:53:51,267 --> 00:53:52,467
Hm.

924
00:53:54,834 --> 00:53:56,701
This one's really beautiful.

925
00:53:56,701 --> 00:53:58,767
Lonely.

926
00:54:02,434 --> 00:54:04,367
You should do
something with these.

927
00:54:04,367 --> 00:54:05,367
Oh.

928
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,567
Yeah.

929
00:54:06,567 --> 00:54:07,667
Nah.

930
00:54:09,901 --> 00:54:11,634
Why not?

931
00:54:13,300 --> 00:54:15,100
They're interesting.

932
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:16,467
Ah. You're interesting.

933
00:54:16,467 --> 00:54:18,801
No, I'm not.

934
00:54:18,801 --> 00:54:20,534
I'm just new to you.

935
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:31,334
Hey.

936
00:54:45,834 --> 00:54:49,434
See if South Shell
is hiring, Christ.

937
00:54:49,434 --> 00:54:51,534
It's a solution, Frankie.
It's a possible job

938
00:54:51,534 --> 00:54:52,868
and a possible paycheck.

939
00:54:52,868 --> 00:54:55,033
Well, it's not gonna
possibly fucking happen.

940
00:54:55,033 --> 00:54:57,400
So let's not talk about it.
I don't wanna talk about it.

941
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,601
Oh, really?
Well, that's convenient.

942
00:55:01,267 --> 00:55:03,601
Eat with your spoon.

943
00:55:12,133 --> 00:55:14,100
Did you eat
something bad?

944
00:55:16,767 --> 00:55:18,667
No.

945
00:55:22,467 --> 00:55:24,767
No, I-I didn't
eat anything.

946
00:55:24,767 --> 00:55:27,133
Well, maybe that's it.

947
00:55:27,133 --> 00:55:29,167
Um...

948
00:55:29,167 --> 00:55:31,300
No, I-I don't think
that's it.

949
00:55:33,634 --> 00:55:36,133
Wha--? How do you know?

950
00:55:36,133 --> 00:55:37,901
Because I know that--

951
00:55:37,901 --> 00:55:40,067
That that's not it.

952
00:55:46,334 --> 00:55:48,200
Frankie...

953
00:55:56,968 --> 00:55:58,300
Here.

954
00:55:59,234 --> 00:56:01,901
No. Ah.

955
00:56:04,467 --> 00:56:06,400
Take your breakfast,
eat it outside.

956
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:08,334
But it's raining, Daddy.

957
00:56:08,334 --> 00:56:10,234
What, do I speak Swahili?

958
00:56:10,234 --> 00:56:12,400
Outside.

959
00:56:25,868 --> 00:56:27,434
Baby.

960
00:56:29,868 --> 00:56:32,133
I can go to the doctor.

961
00:56:34,968 --> 00:56:36,234
You can go to the what?

962
00:56:36,234 --> 00:56:38,934
Gina has a lady doctor who--

963
00:56:38,934 --> 00:56:41,334
Who can take care
of it.

964
00:56:41,334 --> 00:56:42,834
You wanna kill
one of my kids?

965
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:47,167
Don't you ever say
that to me.

966
00:56:52,901 --> 00:56:56,000
You wanna kill
one of my kids?

967
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,334
No!

968
00:56:57,334 --> 00:56:59,934
I don't want to, no.

969
00:57:02,167 --> 00:57:04,300
Good, 'cause it's
not an option.

970
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,234
Oh, Frankie.

971
00:57:35,000 --> 00:57:36,667
Come here.

972
00:57:39,534 --> 00:57:41,367
Come here.

973
00:57:43,701 --> 00:57:45,868
Baby, come here.

974
00:57:59,467 --> 00:58:01,634
So I guess the, uh,

975
00:58:01,634 --> 00:58:03,734
not getting pregnant
when you're breastfeeding

976
00:58:03,734 --> 00:58:04,767
is a load of crap.

977
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:09,901
I'm sorry.

978
00:58:09,901 --> 00:58:12,167
No, it's not your fault.

979
00:58:12,167 --> 00:58:14,334
It's me, I got super seed.

980
00:58:14,334 --> 00:58:15,868
It's my cross to bear.

981
00:58:15,868 --> 00:58:17,367
Your cross to bear?

982
00:59:09,167 --> 00:59:10,767
Hey, Cole.

983
00:59:32,334 --> 00:59:34,767
Pass me that towel.

984
00:59:36,167 --> 00:59:38,000
Stop it.

985
01:00:15,234 --> 01:00:18,534
<i>Some people have
a deep, abiding respect</i>

986
01:00:18,534 --> 01:00:22,100
<i>for the natural beauty
that was once this country. </i>

987
01:00:23,701 --> 01:00:25,934
<i>And some people don't. </i>

988
01:00:26,767 --> 01:00:29,200
<i>People start pollution. </i>

989
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:31,267
<i>People can stop it. </i>

990
01:00:35,801 --> 01:00:38,801
<i>* We need Jimmy Carter
We can't aff-- *</i>

991
01:00:50,734 --> 01:00:53,234
Oh. Oh.
Come here.

992
01:00:53,234 --> 01:00:54,434
Here.

993
01:00:55,734 --> 01:00:57,701
Take that, you give one
for your sister.

994
01:00:57,701 --> 01:00:59,300
All right? Beat it.

995
01:01:16,501 --> 01:01:18,000
Yeah?
Excuse me.

996
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,767
I was, uh, wondering
if you're hiring any diggers.

997
01:01:21,767 --> 01:01:24,067
No. No, no,
not right now.

998
01:01:28,167 --> 01:01:29,634
Well, uh, is there
an application

999
01:01:29,634 --> 01:01:31,501
that maybe
I could fill out...

1000
01:01:32,434 --> 01:01:34,367
in case
something comes up?

1001
01:01:36,868 --> 01:01:38,100
Sure.

1002
01:01:39,167 --> 01:01:40,167
Uh...

1003
01:01:42,767 --> 01:01:44,400
There you go.

1004
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:54,200
Uh, excuse me.

1005
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,601
Pen?

1006
01:02:00,367 --> 01:02:02,367
I'm gonna need
that back.

1007
01:02:40,367 --> 01:02:42,667
I'm sorry.
I took your pen.

1008
01:02:55,567 --> 01:02:57,834
Excuse me.
You can't be back here.

1009
01:03:10,067 --> 01:03:11,167
Fuck!

1010
01:03:13,234 --> 01:03:15,801
Where the hell
is that fuck? Damn.

1011
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:24,601
Fuck!

1012
01:03:24,601 --> 01:03:25,634
Fuck!

1013
01:03:25,634 --> 01:03:27,133
Fuck!

1014
01:03:27,133 --> 01:03:30,100
Think anyone'll
buy this boat?

1015
01:03:30,100 --> 01:03:31,300
Maybe I should buy it.

1016
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:33,267
You wanna buy it?

1017
01:03:33,267 --> 01:03:34,901
I'll sell it to you.

1018
01:03:34,901 --> 01:03:37,067
I'll give you a really good deal
because I know you.

1019
01:03:38,501 --> 01:03:41,300
Not that good though,
you know.

1020
01:03:41,300 --> 01:03:43,133
I need to make
something.

1021
01:03:45,200 --> 01:03:46,167
Here.

1022
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:53,434
I freak out
sometimes.

1023
01:03:56,934 --> 01:03:58,400
We all freak out
sometimes.

1024
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,434
Yeah, I know,
but...

1025
01:04:00,434 --> 01:04:03,868
I really--
I freak out sometimes.

1026
01:04:06,267 --> 01:04:08,601
And you make me
not wanna freak out.

1027
01:04:11,334 --> 01:04:12,534
Okay.

1028
01:04:15,267 --> 01:04:18,901
Maybe when you go back to
New York, I'll come visit you.

1029
01:04:18,901 --> 01:04:21,133
You know?
See the crazies.

1030
01:04:21,133 --> 01:04:23,801
Oh, no.

1031
01:04:23,801 --> 01:04:25,067
No.

1032
01:04:25,067 --> 01:04:27,000
I-- I mean,
that shouldn't happen.

1033
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,667
Why not?

1034
01:04:28,667 --> 01:04:32,100
Because I don't want you
to come and see me in New York.

1035
01:04:32,100 --> 01:04:33,434
What?

1036
01:04:33,434 --> 01:04:37,334
Wait. Is there
something here,

1037
01:04:37,334 --> 01:04:39,534
or am I making
that up?

1038
01:04:39,534 --> 01:04:41,634
No, you're not
making anything up.

1039
01:04:41,634 --> 01:04:44,968
I mean, I'm having
a great time. I just...

1040
01:04:44,968 --> 01:04:46,767
I have a lot
of my own stuff.

1041
01:04:46,767 --> 01:04:48,834
You know? And...
I mean, I thought I--

1042
01:04:48,834 --> 01:04:51,400
I thought I made this clear
from the beginning.

1043
01:04:53,234 --> 01:04:55,334
Look, we're just
having fun.

1044
01:04:55,334 --> 01:04:57,100
Right?
Fun, yeah.

1045
01:05:00,801 --> 01:05:02,300
Look, this is
my fault.

1046
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:05,100
I shouldn't have given you
the wrong impression.

1047
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:07,234
Damn. I broke my own rule.

1048
01:05:07,234 --> 01:05:10,300
Uh, what--? What rule is that?
Don't screw a local?

1049
01:05:11,701 --> 01:05:13,167
That's mean.

1050
01:05:20,501 --> 01:05:21,667
Hunt, are you with me?

1051
01:05:26,033 --> 01:05:27,534
Yeah.

1052
01:05:27,534 --> 01:05:29,334
No. Obviously.

1053
01:05:29,334 --> 01:05:30,868
I'm gonna take
you home.

1054
01:05:39,834 --> 01:05:41,634
Here's your bulb.

1055
01:05:43,067 --> 01:05:44,467
Thank you.

1056
01:05:50,434 --> 01:05:52,634
I didn't just
screw you.

1057
01:06:03,634 --> 01:06:05,100
I can walk home.

1058
01:06:23,968 --> 01:06:25,334
Hey.

1059
01:06:25,334 --> 01:06:26,400
Hey.

1060
01:06:34,167 --> 01:06:36,300
Is there something
you'd like to ask?

1061
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:40,767
No?

1062
01:06:40,767 --> 01:06:44,067
Then quit with
the mental-patient stare.

1063
01:06:44,067 --> 01:06:46,400
What the hell
is wrong with you?

1064
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,234
What the hell
is wrong with you?

1065
01:06:48,234 --> 01:06:50,200
Why are you
hanging out with Jack?

1066
01:06:52,434 --> 01:06:54,667
I'm not.
You know, he, um...

1067
01:06:56,200 --> 01:06:57,834
He helped me
with Daddy's truck

1068
01:06:57,834 --> 01:06:59,834
that one day, but...

1069
01:07:02,334 --> 01:07:03,534
Okay.

1070
01:07:03,534 --> 01:07:05,067
Are you gonna get mad?

1071
01:07:06,934 --> 01:07:08,434
<i>Yeah.
But are you gonna get mad?</i>

1072
01:07:08,434 --> 01:07:10,267
Yeah.
Then I'm not gonna answer you.

1073
01:07:10,267 --> 01:07:12,734
You just did.
Bullshit I did.

1074
01:07:12,734 --> 01:07:15,067
Do you have
any id--?

1075
01:07:15,067 --> 01:07:16,200
I'm gonna
kill him.

1076
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:17,801
Stop it. Hey, hey.

1077
01:07:17,801 --> 01:07:19,801
Stop it.
Who do you think you are?

1078
01:07:19,801 --> 01:07:21,634
This is Jack
we're talking about!

1079
01:07:21,634 --> 01:07:23,934
Don't you think
I know who he is?

1080
01:07:23,934 --> 01:07:25,567
I know what that scumbag
is all about.

1081
01:07:25,567 --> 01:07:27,968
Don't call him a scumbag.
I thought you were his friend.

1082
01:07:27,968 --> 01:07:30,501
He is my friend, that's how
I know he's a scumbag.

1083
01:07:30,501 --> 01:07:32,434
Some friend. You know what?

1084
01:07:32,434 --> 01:07:34,501
I probably know him a lot
better than you do.

1085
01:07:34,501 --> 01:07:37,534
I know exactly
what he is all about.

1086
01:07:37,534 --> 01:07:39,634
I have responsibilities--
Not for me you don't.

1087
01:07:39,634 --> 01:07:41,601
You're not responsible for me.

1088
01:07:45,567 --> 01:07:47,133
Hey. Hey.

1089
01:07:48,701 --> 01:07:51,133
I'm 36 years old.

1090
01:07:51,133 --> 01:07:52,767
And I've been
through a lot of shit.

1091
01:07:52,767 --> 01:07:54,100
Both of my parents
are dead,

1092
01:07:54,100 --> 01:07:55,667
and my ex-husband
should be.

1093
01:07:55,667 --> 01:07:57,667
You know, so this
is my time, you know?

1094
01:07:57,667 --> 01:08:00,501
I just wanna
enjoy myself, have fun.

1095
01:08:00,501 --> 01:08:02,467
That's all.
Why does everyone wanna have fun

1096
01:08:02,467 --> 01:08:04,267
all the time?
Hey, Dad would flip

1097
01:08:04,267 --> 01:08:05,667
if he knew that you and Jack--

1098
01:08:05,667 --> 01:08:08,400
Yeah, well,
Dad's not here anymore.

1099
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:10,200
And you're not Dad.

1100
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,267
And you wanna
know something else?

1101
01:08:12,267 --> 01:08:13,467
No, what? Enlighten me.

1102
01:08:13,467 --> 01:08:16,167
You are gonna hate me
saying this.

1103
01:08:16,167 --> 01:08:17,334
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1104
01:08:17,334 --> 01:08:20,467
Jack doesn't disappoint.

1105
01:08:20,467 --> 01:08:22,367
Fuck.
Yeah. Don't do anything stupid.

1106
01:08:22,367 --> 01:08:24,100
I mean it. I mean it!

1107
01:08:26,334 --> 01:08:28,267
<i>* I'm feeling good *</i>

1108
01:08:28,267 --> 01:08:29,968
<i>* About America *</i>

1109
01:08:29,968 --> 01:08:33,300
<i>* And I feel it
Everywhere I go *</i>

1110
01:08:33,300 --> 01:08:35,033
<i>* I'm feeling good *</i>

1111
01:08:35,033 --> 01:08:37,501
<i>* About America *</i>

1112
01:08:37,501 --> 01:08:40,467
Albert Einstein said--
And I'm paraphrasing here.

1113
01:08:40,467 --> 01:08:42,767
- -"I don't believe God
would have created a universe

1114
01:08:42,767 --> 01:08:44,300
any less than perfect. "

1115
01:08:44,300 --> 01:08:46,667
He's of the theory
the universe is marble-like:

1116
01:08:46,667 --> 01:08:49,033
smooth, round,
no imperfections, beautiful,

1117
01:08:49,033 --> 01:08:50,400
just perfect.

1118
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:52,467
Why would God create anything
less than perfect?

1119
01:08:52,467 --> 01:08:53,634
Right?

1120
01:08:55,501 --> 01:08:57,300
That's one
school of thought.

1121
01:08:59,000 --> 01:09:00,734
The other school
believes the universe

1122
01:09:00,734 --> 01:09:01,767
.

1123
01:09:01,767 --> 01:09:03,234
It does have
imperfections:

1124
01:09:03,234 --> 01:09:05,801
ridges and knots
and holes.

1125
01:09:05,801 --> 01:09:07,400
And those,
in laymen terms,

1126
01:09:07,400 --> 01:09:09,834
are the two schools
of quantum physics.

1127
01:09:09,834 --> 01:09:12,234
You're either
of the belief that the universe

1128
01:09:12,234 --> 01:09:14,801
and everything that exists is
made up of marble,

1129
01:09:14,801 --> 01:09:16,033
or it's made up of wood.

1130
01:09:16,033 --> 01:09:18,334
Marble or wood.

1131
01:09:19,267 --> 01:09:21,234
Marble or wood.

1132
01:09:21,234 --> 01:09:22,400
No?

1133
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:24,534
All right,
check it out.

1134
01:09:27,667 --> 01:09:28,767
Hm?

1135
01:09:33,234 --> 01:09:35,934
Let's try
to lighten the mood.

1136
01:09:35,934 --> 01:09:37,801
<i>What could be more welcoming</i>

1137
01:09:37,801 --> 01:09:39,667
<i>after Vietnam, Watergate</i>

1138
01:09:39,667 --> 01:09:41,501
<i>and all we've been through?</i>

1139
01:09:42,667 --> 01:09:44,334
Oh, shit.

1140
01:09:44,334 --> 01:09:45,400
What?

1141
01:09:45,400 --> 01:09:47,567
Those are
the South Shell assholes.

1142
01:09:47,567 --> 01:09:49,334
<i>The South Shell
assholes?</i>

1143
01:09:49,334 --> 01:09:50,434
Yep.

1144
01:09:53,334 --> 01:09:54,334
That guy
is big.

1145
01:09:54,334 --> 01:09:55,501
Yep.

1146
01:09:55,501 --> 01:09:57,234
<i>There is a change that's... </i>

1147
01:09:57,234 --> 01:09:58,501
Hey.

1148
01:10:06,567 --> 01:10:08,100
Hey, pal.

1149
01:10:09,601 --> 01:10:12,200
You look familiar.

1150
01:10:12,200 --> 01:10:13,667
Hey, lemme ask
you something.

1151
01:10:13,667 --> 01:10:16,467
Would you say you're made up
of marble or wood?

1152
01:10:16,467 --> 01:10:17,701
Hell are you
talking about?

1153
01:10:17,701 --> 01:10:19,534
We're not talking to you,
little man.

1154
01:10:19,534 --> 01:10:22,501
Little man, big mind. It's a
simple question. Marble or wood?

1155
01:10:22,501 --> 01:10:23,734
Can you believe
this shit?

1156
01:10:25,234 --> 01:10:27,968
Didn't your mother teach you
to pick up your trash?

1157
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:31,234
You don't know
my mom.

1158
01:10:33,868 --> 01:10:35,567
Let me buy
you fellas a shot.

1159
01:10:35,567 --> 01:10:37,200
Nick,
four Turkeys.

1160
01:10:38,868 --> 01:10:40,467
You didn't answer my question.

1161
01:10:40,467 --> 01:10:41,868
Are you made up
of wood or marble?

1162
01:10:41,868 --> 01:10:43,968
Tell you what your friend
better be made of.

1163
01:10:43,968 --> 01:10:45,167
He better be
made of money.

1164
01:10:45,167 --> 01:10:47,801
He's got some damages
to pay for.

1165
01:10:48,534 --> 01:10:49,534
Four more.

1166
01:10:51,067 --> 01:10:52,300
Big spender.

1167
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:54,133
This is a good idea.
Let's drink and relax.

1168
01:10:54,133 --> 01:10:56,400
Wood, marble, pfft.
What--? What does it matter?

1169
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,734
You know what
I'm gonna do?

1170
01:10:57,734 --> 01:11:00,067
I'm gonna go roll
a big joint, eh?

1171
01:11:00,067 --> 01:11:02,534
We can all smoke
from the peace pipe.

1172
01:11:02,534 --> 01:11:04,167
Ah, I'll be
right back.

1173
01:11:07,133 --> 01:11:08,767
Nobody do
anything bad.

1174
01:11:08,767 --> 01:11:10,133
Three more.

1175
01:11:15,501 --> 01:11:17,400
Don't do
anything bad.

1176
01:11:17,400 --> 01:11:19,167
Be cool.

1177
01:11:19,167 --> 01:11:21,467
Be cool.

1178
01:11:22,300 --> 01:11:23,901
Be cool, man.

1179
01:11:23,901 --> 01:11:24,934
Be cool, man.

1180
01:11:24,934 --> 01:11:26,467
Be cool.
Be cool.

1181
01:11:26,467 --> 01:11:27,934
<i>Oh, and look at this. </i>

1182
01:11:27,934 --> 01:11:29,734
It keeps coming.

1183
01:11:29,734 --> 01:11:32,167
Hey, uh... did it say

1184
01:11:32,167 --> 01:11:34,701
"generous motherfucker"
on his application?

1185
01:11:34,701 --> 01:11:36,868
I don't know.

1186
01:11:36,868 --> 01:11:37,934
I didn't read it.

1187
01:11:43,267 --> 01:11:45,200
He's gonna pay
for those damages though.

1188
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,400
Yeah, yeah.
He's gonna pay.

1189
01:11:50,901 --> 01:11:52,267
You want me to pay?

1190
01:11:52,267 --> 01:11:53,834
Is that what you want?

1191
01:11:55,501 --> 01:11:57,267
'Cause-- 'Cause I have
my money outside,

1192
01:11:57,267 --> 01:11:59,200
if you'd like to come
outside with me.

1193
01:11:59,200 --> 01:12:01,133
You wanna go outside?
That's what I'd like.

1194
01:12:01,133 --> 01:12:03,534
You wanna go outside with us?
That's what I'd like.

1195
01:12:03,534 --> 01:12:05,701
To get the money
that you haven't got.

1196
01:12:06,934 --> 01:12:09,200
That's exactly
what I'd like.

1197
01:12:16,334 --> 01:12:17,634
And then
I swallowed it.

1198
01:12:18,667 --> 01:12:20,133
Serious, wouldn't you?

1199
01:12:28,534 --> 01:12:29,534
You're a son of a bitch.

1200
01:12:29,534 --> 01:12:30,534
What?

1201
01:12:30,534 --> 01:12:32,133
Are you fucking
my sister?

1202
01:12:32,133 --> 01:12:33,634
Whoa, take it easy.
Take--

1203
01:12:33,634 --> 01:12:35,167
Are you fucking her?
Take it easy.

1204
01:12:35,167 --> 01:12:36,934
Are you?
It's not like that.

1205
01:12:36,934 --> 01:12:39,567
Just answer the question.
What--?

1206
01:12:39,567 --> 01:12:41,067
No.

1207
01:12:41,067 --> 01:12:42,868
I am not.

1208
01:12:42,868 --> 01:12:44,667
No, I'm not
fucking your sister.

1209
01:12:44,667 --> 01:12:46,968
You're a fucking liar,
'cause she told me. Son of a--

1210
01:13:00,667 --> 01:13:02,267
Aw, fuck.

1211
01:13:08,334 --> 01:13:10,033
Oh!

1212
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:30,667
Hausenfeffer!

1213
01:13:33,367 --> 01:13:35,467
Hausenfeffer!

1214
01:13:35,467 --> 01:13:37,133
Fucking
hausenfeffer, man!

1215
01:13:39,467 --> 01:13:41,267
You get
the fuck off me!

1216
01:13:41,267 --> 01:13:43,133
You jackass!

1217
01:13:52,267 --> 01:13:53,367
Motherfucker!

1218
01:13:57,601 --> 01:13:58,534
Hey, hey.

1219
01:13:59,701 --> 01:14:01,267
Ow! Fucker.

1220
01:14:01,267 --> 01:14:02,801
Jesus Christ.

1221
01:14:07,133 --> 01:14:08,067
Whoa.

1222
01:14:13,434 --> 01:14:15,334
Cut the shit.

1223
01:14:21,667 --> 01:14:23,767
Oh, shit.

1224
01:14:26,033 --> 01:14:28,300
Jesus, they give me
a minute to make a call.

1225
01:14:28,300 --> 01:14:29,367
They give Cons an hour.

1226
01:14:29,367 --> 01:14:31,200
Is Julie pissed off?

1227
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,033
She'll get
over it.

1228
01:14:36,434 --> 01:14:38,133
She's a catch, huh?

1229
01:14:39,868 --> 01:14:41,968
No shit, man.
She's my heart.

1230
01:14:49,267 --> 01:14:51,767
You like being a father?

1231
01:14:54,767 --> 01:14:56,367
Well...

1232
01:14:56,367 --> 01:14:59,434
kids drive me bananas, but...

1233
01:14:59,434 --> 01:15:02,300
I thank God every day
for those little fuckers.

1234
01:15:04,501 --> 01:15:06,567
They saved my life,
you know?

1235
01:15:10,634 --> 01:15:12,801
Hey. I broke a tooth.

1236
01:15:12,801 --> 01:15:14,934
Hey. You're lucky
you're over there, asshole.

1237
01:15:14,934 --> 01:15:16,801
Yeah, right. I'm the asshole.

1238
01:15:16,801 --> 01:15:18,667
Shut the fuck up.

1239
01:15:18,667 --> 01:15:21,167
What are you really
so pissed off about anyway, huh?

1240
01:15:21,167 --> 01:15:23,701
Why am I--? Our dad dies.

1241
01:15:23,701 --> 01:15:26,100
Gina's still recovering
from the shrapnel of Shithead,

1242
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:28,200
you think it's the perfect time
to fuck my sister.

1243
01:15:28,200 --> 01:15:29,834
Fuck you, Hunt!

1244
01:15:29,834 --> 01:15:33,367
First of all, you have no idea
what's going on between us.

1245
01:15:33,367 --> 01:15:36,367
Secondly... fuck you.

1246
01:15:36,367 --> 01:15:40,000
And thirdly, what business is it
of yours anyway, huh?

1247
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:41,100
I mean, who are you?

1248
01:15:41,100 --> 01:15:42,400
I'm her brother, you idiot.

1249
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:45,534
Yeah, you're a 34-year-old man.
You're an adult.

1250
01:15:45,534 --> 01:15:47,000
Try worrying about yourself.

1251
01:15:47,000 --> 01:15:48,067
Stay away from her.

1252
01:15:48,067 --> 01:15:50,734
I was just trying
to help Gina out.

1253
01:15:50,734 --> 01:15:53,133
I'm telling you the truth.

1254
01:15:53,133 --> 01:15:55,067
I-- I wasn't looking for it.

1255
01:15:55,067 --> 01:15:56,133
And...

1256
01:15:57,300 --> 01:15:58,567
Then it just happened.

1257
01:15:58,567 --> 01:16:00,033
What, "it just happened"?

1258
01:16:00,033 --> 01:16:02,367
Y-you stuck your dick
in every hole in this town?

1259
01:16:02,367 --> 01:16:04,267
Oh!
You made a choice.

1260
01:16:04,267 --> 01:16:06,367
You make choices
and you live with that.

1261
01:16:06,367 --> 01:16:08,300
Okay.
All right, I got it.

1262
01:16:08,300 --> 01:16:10,601
Just like you chose
not to be there

1263
01:16:10,601 --> 01:16:12,367
when your sister
needed you most.

1264
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:15,400
Because you had to go
take a picture of a pole.

1265
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:17,567
Like you chose to sleep in

1266
01:16:17,567 --> 01:16:18,868
and not be in the bay

1267
01:16:18,868 --> 01:16:20,901
the day your father died.

1268
01:16:20,901 --> 01:16:24,033
Or like you choose
to be here,

1269
01:16:24,033 --> 01:16:25,834
with all of us
in this place,

1270
01:16:25,834 --> 01:16:27,834
and yet you're not
really here at all.

1271
01:16:27,834 --> 01:16:29,367
You know what I mean?

1272
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:35,234
So yes, I'm fucking your sister.

1273
01:16:44,133 --> 01:16:47,434
Okay, here's the deal.

1274
01:16:47,434 --> 01:16:50,133
It's in two parts, let me
get it all out. One:

1275
01:16:50,133 --> 01:16:51,901
Those three assholes
are getting sewn up

1276
01:16:51,901 --> 01:16:53,000
over at Good Samaritan's.

1277
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:54,567
Fine. Their problem,
not ours.

1278
01:16:54,567 --> 01:16:56,534
Because what we've got
is a witness statement

1279
01:16:56,534 --> 01:16:57,834
saying they jumped you,
Lozo,

1280
01:16:57,834 --> 01:16:59,434
and you were acting
in self-defense.

1281
01:16:59,434 --> 01:17:01,701
Also, I was in the bathroom
the whole time.
Witness?

1282
01:17:01,701 --> 01:17:03,634
Nick, bartender,
client of mine.

1283
01:17:03,634 --> 01:17:06,200
Yeah, but where were we?
You?You were--

1284
01:17:06,200 --> 01:17:08,834
I don't know. Playing fucking
tiddlywinks with Gina.
Hey.

1285
01:17:08,834 --> 01:17:10,901
Let's say you were taking
snapshots of your nuts.

1286
01:17:10,901 --> 01:17:12,400
Why is this hard
to let me finish?

1287
01:17:12,400 --> 01:17:13,801
Okay, two.

1288
01:17:13,801 --> 01:17:15,334
This part kills me.

1289
01:17:16,167 --> 01:17:18,000
My supplier,

1290
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:19,834
who will go unnamed,

1291
01:17:19,834 --> 01:17:23,367
will now receive 80 percent
of my profits. Fine.

1292
01:17:23,367 --> 01:17:25,567
So one of you
or all of you

1293
01:17:25,567 --> 01:17:29,400
is gonna give me a place to stay
during this down-and-out phase.

1294
01:17:29,400 --> 01:17:30,767
This doesn't happen,

1295
01:17:30,767 --> 01:17:34,033
we all get to know each other
better in jail. Understood?

1296
01:17:42,667 --> 01:17:44,801
So I was thinking
we should have a talk.

1297
01:17:44,801 --> 01:17:47,701
Probably should've
done it before, but...

1298
01:17:47,701 --> 01:17:49,868
you know, we didn't.

1299
01:17:51,601 --> 01:17:53,667
Feel free to jump in
whenever you'd like, Dad.

1300
01:17:53,667 --> 01:17:54,968
It's okay. I don't mind.

1301
01:17:56,901 --> 01:17:59,000
I've been thinking
that, um...

1302
01:18:02,167 --> 01:18:04,267
Well, maybe if I was
out there...

1303
01:18:05,634 --> 01:18:08,467
when you wanted me
to be out there,

1304
01:18:08,467 --> 01:18:10,000
I could've done something.

1305
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:13,167
Or, uh, saved you, or...

1306
01:18:13,167 --> 01:18:15,267
you know,
helped in some way.

1307
01:18:19,567 --> 01:18:21,734
And, uh, I know that...

1308
01:18:23,367 --> 01:18:25,968
You know, I'm not
what you really probably...

1309
01:18:27,734 --> 01:18:30,234
wanted me to be.

1310
01:18:31,367 --> 01:18:32,767
Uh...

1311
01:18:34,601 --> 01:18:36,234
I wish I was.

1312
01:18:41,767 --> 01:18:43,067
Uh...

1313
01:18:45,167 --> 01:18:47,334
I mean I really
wish I was.

1314
01:18:53,701 --> 01:18:55,801
And, uh...

1315
01:19:01,167 --> 01:19:03,033
I'm sorry that I was...

1316
01:19:04,334 --> 01:19:05,701
late.

1317
01:19:17,567 --> 01:19:19,234
You guys sure
about this?

1318
01:19:19,234 --> 01:19:21,701
Sure, man.
Absolutely.

1319
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:29,567
<i>* Heyla ho, boys *</i>

1320
01:22:29,567 --> 01:22:32,100
The dredge boats are
gonna love that shit.

1321
01:22:36,834 --> 01:22:40,267
<i>* Altogether *</i>

1322
01:22:40,267 --> 01:22:43,868

1323
01:22:43,868 --> 01:22:47,400

1324
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:51,200
<i>* Sailing homeward *</i>

1325
01:22:51,200 --> 01:22:54,434
<i>* To Mingulay *</i>

1326
01:22:58,868 --> 01:23:00,434
<i>"Dear Jimmy, </i>

1327
01:23:00,434 --> 01:23:01,868

1331
01:23:10,734 --> 01:23:13,200
Julie.
What?

1332
01:23:13,200 --> 01:23:14,601
Julie!

1333
01:23:15,634 --> 01:23:17,067
I said, what?

1334
01:23:17,067 --> 01:23:18,968
Stop the kids
from flushing the toy shit

1335
01:23:18,968 --> 01:23:20,834
down the toilet.
You want the kids to stop,

1336
01:23:20,834 --> 01:23:22,133
tell them yourself,
Frankie,

1337
01:23:22,133 --> 01:23:23,701
because they're thick
like you.

1338
01:23:23,701 --> 01:23:25,300
You can't be afraid to yell.

1339
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:27,767
I'm not afraid.
Obviously you're not afraid.

1340
01:23:27,767 --> 01:23:29,467
You're yelling at me
in front of people.

1341
01:23:29,467 --> 01:23:31,934
I'm not yelling at you.
This is not yelling.

1342
01:23:31,934 --> 01:23:33,934
You're not yelling right now?
No.

1343
01:23:33,934 --> 01:23:36,100
Is she not yell--? Don't answer.
Are you yelling?

1344
01:23:36,100 --> 01:23:37,634
No, I am not
yelling at you.

1345
01:23:37,634 --> 01:23:39,133
Before you jump to it,
answer the--

1346
01:23:39,133 --> 01:23:41,801
Listen to what I'm saying.
I'm giving you an option.

1347
01:23:41,801 --> 01:23:43,267
Yes or no? Yes or no?

1348
01:23:43,267 --> 01:23:44,267
No.

1349
01:23:44,267 --> 01:23:46,300
This is what I deal with
every day.

1350
01:23:46,300 --> 01:23:48,267
That's really nice, Frankie.
Hey, hey, hey.

1351
01:23:49,200 --> 01:23:51,167
You look good.

1352
01:24:30,267 --> 01:24:31,567
Which way are you headed?

1353
01:24:31,567 --> 01:24:32,901
West.

1354
01:24:34,400 --> 01:24:36,234
If I'll go the other way,
I'll hit water.

1355
01:24:37,434 --> 01:24:38,901
So Jack's
not moving in?

1356
01:24:38,901 --> 01:24:41,901
God, no.
Jack'snotmoving in.

1357
01:24:41,901 --> 01:24:43,267
Hey, we're out
of toilet paper.

1358
01:24:43,267 --> 01:24:45,267
Uh, no smoking in the house,
you shit.

1359
01:24:45,267 --> 01:24:47,667
Your old man smoked here.
Look where that got him.

1360
01:24:47,667 --> 01:24:49,901
Finish it outside, or I'll
put it out on your tongue.

1361
01:24:49,901 --> 01:24:51,567
You are definitely
made of wood.

1362
01:25:04,801 --> 01:25:06,400
Hey, Cons.

1363
01:25:07,767 --> 01:25:09,801
Take care
of my sister.

1364
01:25:09,801 --> 01:25:11,467
That's why I'm here.

1365
01:25:17,801 --> 01:25:20,367
<i>* Seventy-three men sailed up *</i>

1366
01:25:20,367 --> 01:25:24,133
<i>* From the San Francisco Bay *</i>

1367
01:25:25,601 --> 01:25:27,367
