I hope that I am still alive
when this film is shown,
because this kind of thing
is dangerous...
...in the sense that one
considers oneself complete,
with the right to self-analysis,
when nothing is complete.
I am in the middle of my life.
I am at the formative stage.
I am still an adolescent.
So, if I am alive
when this film is seen...
...that would mean that...
...everything is magical!

The first question I want to ask is:
Who are you?
That's an impossible question
not to be asked.
The Emperor of China asked the
same question to Bodhidharma.
He had crossed India to come
to China...
...where he thought he could
fiind disciples.
So, the Emperor met him
and asked:
''I translated 2000 books.
What is my merit?''
And Bodhidharma answered:
''There is no merit!''
The Emperor said: ''Who are you
to speak to me like that?''
And Bodhidharma replied:
''I don't know.'' And he left.
You can only know who you are
when you are dead.
You cease to exist when you say,
''That's what I am.''
As soon as I can define myself,
I am dead.
People consider me a mystic...
...because I treat themes that
others avoid treating.
But I consider myself
neither a mystic nor an artist.
I am someone
who is playing games.
I am a gambler...
...just like people in casinos...
...who spend all their money.
But as an artist, what I burn...
...is part of myself, my ego.
Write on my hand
with your finger.
I am extremely attracted to what
I don't understand.
My intuition tells me...
...that therein lies
something important to study.
That's how I started to mime:
I didn't understand what
physical expression was about.
Did you start to mime in Chile?
Yes.
I was a successful actor
at the university theater.
Then I realized that my success
didn't come from me...
...but from the text I was reading.
I asked myself: ''What is an actor?
A parrot that reads a text?
Or everything but the text?''
So I decided to found a theater
without any text.
That's how I discovered
the art of mime.
It was in the early fifties.
I already had my company
in Paris at that time.
Alejandro came from Chile...
...and was searching...
...for an art form like mime.
In Chile I had
a company of sixty people.
But I felt I had
nothing more to learn.
So I decided to come to Europe.
I had reached my limit.
Then Alejandro and I met again in '62.
He wrote ''The Cage'' for me.
He told me the story without miming:
A man walks and finds a cage,
a wall...
Alejandro didn't show it to me...
...but at that time I had already
invented this concept...
...that I didn't learn from Decroux,
my master:
this point of support in space.
Alejandro felt it.
We were in a state of osmosis.
The character is a prisoner in
a square cage...
...that shrinks
as he is trying to get out.
He puts his hand out...
...to feel the air, freedom.
He manages to get out...
...but finds himself prisoner
of a bigger cage.
The cage shrinks and this time
he remains trapped.
The first person he finds
is stingy.
He asks him for money,
and the man refuses.
The character is obsessed
with crime.
Knives are drawn,
but he rejects them.
Finally, he takes a knife.
He uses it...
...because he is
refused money...
and he kills the stingy man.
He opens his chest and wants
to eat his heart,
but the heart is much too hard.
This was a bad heart.
So I rejected it.
The second meeting
is with a woman.
At that point, Alejandro and I
had a discussion.
He wanted me to eat the heart
of this beautiful woman.
In the first meeting,
the heart was too tough to eat,
but when I met this beautiful woman,
I was to invite her to dance...
then kill her, take her heart...
and eat it.
I told him that I couldn't...
...and showed him
something else instead.
I imagined that this heart...
,,,was like transparent blood,
which vanishes.
I never met this woman.
She was just an illusion...
''Very good!'' said Alejandro.
The third meeting
is with the children...
...who represent the future.
The man comes across this child--
actually, two children.
The first one is afraid
and manages to escape.
The second stays behind,
and he kidnaps this child.
I remember I could hear mothers
in the audience...
indignant at the kidnapping.
Then I take out the knife...
and I kill the child.
It is unbearable.
It goes beyond Artaud...
in the concept of cruelty.
Then I take his heart...
...and drink his blood.
Through this act
I become the child.
I realize that I have
destroyed posterity...
...so I kill myself...
...and give the heart back to
the child who comes to life again.
He then leaves, thanking me.
Panic.
This is a reference
to the god ''Pan. ''
The Panic Movement
is a sexual act in its totality.
The Panic Movement was based
on the explosion of reason.
We knew what was to become
obvious for science today:
that we are unable...
...to explain the world...
...solely through the means
of reason.
I wanted to do shows
that would never be repeated.
This increased my possibilities...
...of expression considerably.
We would use gelatins, rotten food,
massive destruction...
and a lot of things.
We now have the choice between
the absurd and mystery.
It's the scientific choice:
the absurd or mystery.
We are not obsessed
with the absurd...
we are not fanatics
about the absurd...
we are not fanatics
about mystery...
we are not soldiers
of confusion.
What we are for is...
uncertainty...
this impossibility to explain...
the fact that time and space
is an illusion.
This explosion...
shows us that we cannot live...
holding on to this
overwhelming reason...
which prevented
us from flourishing.
We broke off with surrealism...
because Breton had created
a surrealist respectablity...
that we wanted to go beyond.
He didn't accept science fiction,
he wanted the fantastic and the poetic.
He didn't like rock music.
He didn't like--
let's not make a list.
He didn't like anything
in the world.
Surrealism had become an incredibly
petit bourgeois movement.
Would you like to talk about
your theatrical work?
I started in Mexico--
A wild place--
with avant garde theater.
My first act there
was Beckett's '' Endgame.''
They called Samuel Beckett a dog,
a son-of-a-bitch.
He was insulted.
I was insulted.
They vomited on me.
All the critics, everyone.
As if we were degenerates.
Then they were embarrassed
when Beckett got the Nobel Prize.
It was scandalous.
I did Ionesco, Exit the King
Those shows lasted
for several years.
I did about a hundred plays.
Adamov, Beckett,
Ionesco, Strindberg...
...theater of the absurd, Arrabal...
jodorowsky is insanely talented.
Quite literally, he's talented
to the point of madness.
But, as with all madmen,
there's a method to his madness.
He's a mathematical madman.
He's a divine madman.
He's a constructivist madman.
And this madness, this intelligence,
this talent--
for there's no talent
without madness--
find their unique expression
in directing, I believe.
You directed ''Fando & Lis''
on stage and then on screen.
Yes, I loved that play--
I played a role in it...
one of three main characters...
and I loved it.
I loved this play by Arrabal...
because it had
a sort of childish purity...
...in a sadomasochisticworld.
It was poetry to me.
I produced the play, we made no money,
but we loved it.
So we ran out of cash;
we had to stop.
I remember I cried.
We were sad to have to stop.
For we loved that play.
Then I decided to make films...
...and asked Arrabal if I could
adapt his play in my own way...
...without a screenplay.
I filmed on weekends...
...with what memory of the play
that remained in my head.
The performance of'' Fando & Lis''...
...and the film that followed...
...are a total mystery for me.
I never understood it,
and I don't want to.
The day I understand it
I will love it less.
I just saw '' Fando & Lis'' again.
Thirty years later I am impressed
with the intensity...
...of my artistic determination.
It is a pure piece of art
without any concession.
I didn't care about how
the audience would react,
whether they'd be bored or shocked.
I didn't care
about all the technical research,
like finding a rhythm for a scene
for the sake of the audience.
I didn't work with the audience in mind.
I just did it with all my guts.
You can see the result.
I am proud of this film
because it is real.
In Mexico,
no one expected such a film.
People literally wanted to kill me!
I had to rush out of the Acapulco
Film Festival hidden in a car...
...because they wanted to lynch me.
''The Holy Mountain''
begins like a fairy tale.
I play two characters:
the magician and the thief
who speaks with my voice.
The thief represents the ego...
...and the magician
the essential being.
From a fairy tale
the film evolves...
...into realistic cinema...
...with a hand-held camera and
little means to reach the truth.
And the magician becomes real,
like you and me.
Art has always been present
in my life.
I never made any distinctions
between making a film and my life.
''The Holy Mountain''
was an essential experience.
At the time I was obsessed
with reaching enlightenment.
So I thought that the film could be
as sacred as an initiation...
...or a holy book,
and we had to live it.
In Mexico, a man
knocked on my door and said:
'' Mr.jodorowsky, I'm here because
I want to study enlightenment.''
I was delighted.
I told him he had
to find himself, to purify...
...all the things gurus say.
He interrupted me, saying:
'' No, that's not it.''
I said, ''What do you mean
that's not it?''
''I want to study theater.
Talking about illumination,
I see that you use
a lot of lights in theater!''
I understood my mistake.
All this Chinese,japanese
and Tibetan stuff...
...goes directly to my balls.
Illumination doesn't exist.
We are all illuminated;
we just don't realize it.
The great mystery is to be alive,
here and now.
Nothing else
is as important as that.
It's an incredible mystery.
What more are we looking for?
Do you consider yourself
a magician of cinema?
I would like to be, but I am not,
and it's not because of modesty.
I have only done six or seven films,
which is very little.
Cinema is a matter of practice,
a bit like karate.
You punch and punch
until you achieve magic.
But I haven't punched enough
to find the magic.
As a matter of fact,
I haven't even begun to make films.
It's only now that I begin
to see that.
For me cinema is highly important.
When making a film, one disappears.
The person who made my films
is not me.
I was always like a medium
in a trance.
When I choose an actor,
my whole body trembles.
One actor is one film.
Another actor is like another film.
That's important to know.
If you make a mistake,
the film is spoiled.
Sometimes, I follow my intuition,
and I don't know if they
will act well and become sick,
but therein lies an instinct,
a desire, an unconscious order.
It makes me sick
because I can be wrong.
For ''Santa Sangre,''
I chose my son Axel,
I didn't know if it was because I
loved him as a father...
...or if it was
because of his acting skills.
So I decided to have him pass
an audition.
I went to his examination at Marceau's
mime school and was convinced.
But I was still afraid I had made
a mistake because he was my son.
So we discussed it,
my life is in your hands.
If you are wrong, we're done.
If I'm wrong, we're done.
For ''The Rainbow Thief',
everything was imposed on me.
I fully assumed this nightmare.
The producer wanted to offer
a present to his wife...
...by making a film
out of her script.
She is a talented writer, and somehow
was influenced by my filmmaking.
She has her world,
she's a good writer...
and I found her script interesting.
But the producer warned me...
...that the film would cost
at least 10 million dollars...
...so I had to adapt to American
business rules-- I was not free.
I had three detectives
spying on me...
...to make sure that
I wouldn't change any lines.
Every time I wanted to make
even a small change...
...I had to call the writer
and the producer.
He hired stars...
...like Omar Sharif, Peter O'Toole,
and Christopher Lee,
and he warned me
that in case of an argument,
I had to leave...not them,
so I had to be careful...
..not to argue with them.
It was a good massage for my ego.
It was like receiving 300 blows
with a stick every day.
But I managed to adapt and deal
with the new circumstances.
I became friends
with the photographer by adapting.
On my other films,
I was a total dictator.
For ''The Rainbow Thief,''
I was a nobody.
The producer saw the rushes
before I did and would say...
'' Please add a close-up there.''
I felt like I was going to have
a ''balls attack''!
Eventually I adapted,
and it was good for me.
I learned how to do it,
and it became useful in the end.
For ''Tusk,''
the producer swindled me.
He made me sign
for an elephant fight,
but in India it is impossible
to have elephants...
...closer than 15 meters
to each other on the set.
All I needed was one shot with the
elephant close enough to touch...
...at least once for me
to claim there'd been a fight.
On the day of shooting,
inspectors came to check the distance.
I began to pray. First take, nothing;
second take, nothing.
At the sixth take, one elephant
just got mad and started to charge.
I had my fight-- what a miracle!
There is a lot of violence
in your films...
There is no violence.
The explosion of galaxies
is violent.
A comet falling on jupiter...
...making seven big holes
is violent.
The birth of a child
is very violent.
Someone passing away--
and I have assisted dying people--
I go sometimes.
Even if the person is quietly dying,
it's immense violence...
this loss of consciousness.
Life is violent;
the circulation of blood,
the heart beating,
all this is violent.
But there are two types of violence:
creative and destructive.
I am creating art.
And as I was born in a male body,
my art is virile.
Because I was born
in this virile skin.
I've chosen
to be born as a man.
Sometimes I have feminine
or angelical touches,
but there is a strong
virile base.
That's the way it is.
He came to see me because he liked
my film '' El Topo.''
I decided to use my creativity
in something different,
in order to extend my limits.
Another film which remained
as a project is ''Dune. ''
I gave it all up--
the contracts, everything--
I was totally broke.
Michel Seydoux,
who did a good job releasing...
...'' El Topo'' and '' Holy Mountain''
in Paris...
...asked me to make a film
with him.
I proposed '' Dune.''
In fact, I hadn't even
read the book.
Someone had simply told me
what the book was about.
So we bought the rights
for '' Dune''.
And reading it,
I realized he was right.
We had to do it.
Besides, I just liked the story
and needed to support my family.
It was a wonderful failure.
That failure proved to be an ally.
The problem was that the producer
was a multimillionaire.
The lesson of this experience is
that one should never work...
...with people who don't need
to earn money with art...
...because they can abandon a project
just like that.
For them it's like an insect bite.
For me, '' Dune'' was not a failure.
The film was not made, that's all.
What remains
is the wonderful preparation.
We were all euphoric.
The film remains what it should be,
a mirage between the dunes.
Perhaps inside myself
I had the intuition...
...that the film wouldn't be made.
For me the film remains there,
and that's okay.
I saw Moebius' drawing for the
covers of science-fiiction books...
...and I was struck by his
''non-scientific'' vision of space.
Such artistic imagination.
Then I saw his work in '' Blueberry,''
the comic strip.
I saw that he acted like
a film director or a cinematographer.
He had a cinematicvision
in his drawings...
...so I thought he'd be perfect
for the job.
I came in, and two people
were going out.
One of them shouted:
''It's him, it's Moebius.''
The other person rushed towards me,
in a nice way,
and said: ''So you are Moebius.
I am happy to meet you.''
The person I had before me
was Alejandro jodorowsky.
He proposed that I work on
his latest film project, '' Dune.''
In fact I had just finished
Frank Herbert's novel '' Dune''...
...three months before,
and it came as a shock.
I thought thatAmerican cinema,
which was influenced by NASA,
was creating ''flying refrigerators.''
There was absolutely no imagination
in the spacecraft.
I wanted a vessel full of color,
practically living entities.
Look at this pirate vessel
which can hide like a fish.
Giger is the Swiss designer
who conceived the 'Alien''monster.
Look at the head. You can see
the resemblance to ''Alien.''
That's the castle
of the Harkonnen baron...
...who was to be played
by Orson Welles.
There were several worlds, and each
planet had its own designer...
...and its own music score.
Pink Floyd and Magma
were to compose.
Different musicians
were to convey...
the world of each planet.
Dali was to be the mad emperor
of the galaxy.
'' Dune'' was supposed to be
an extraordinary fresco.
Seydoux was thrilled with Alejandro's
fire and enthusiasm,
the ambition of the project; we were
all carried away by the delirium.
I was responsible for
the preparation of all the actors...
...including Brontis, Alejandro's son.
They had to be warriors,
martial arts experts,
so I had to prepare them to fight.
I also had a role,
that of a musician...
...who was a killer at the same time.
My guitar was like a weapon,
and I learned to fight with it.
During this preparation,
my emotions would zigzag...
...between great admiration
and outraged disapproval.
Alejandro's way of thinking
shocked me.
For instance, one day we had to choose
the costumes of the Harkonnens.
He covered his eyes with one hand
and went through the bookshelf,
took a book, by chance it was
Titian's paintings,
brought it to the table
and banged it down,
opened it to a page and blindly
pointed his finger and said:
''It's going to be like that!''
At first it drove me crazy, but
then I realized that he was right,
we could start from anything.
At any rate,
Alejandro had a--
how could I say--
a belief,
or a set of beliefs...
that not knowing...
that going blindly into something
gives a chance...
to that mysterious,
all-knowing part of ourselves...
to express itself.
What we didn't achieve in '' Dune''
we achieved in comic strips,
thanks to the failure of'' Dune.''
I began this immense activity
in comic strips...
...with millions of readers.
I love comic books.
The ''Incal'' is the realization
of'' Dune.''
But we didn't know it at the time.
Maybe Alejandro did because...
...his brain works
like 3,000 crazy computers!
At first I had a dream where I was
looking for the inner God.
I saw two pyramids and decided
to go inside.
Then I exploded in the light.
When I awoke I was happy...
...and that's how I got the idea
for ''Incal''...
...which represents our inner God,
the center of our unconscious.
Alejandro was telling me the story
and miming at the same time...
...and I was free to interrupt him
at any moment.
So, I was creating
to my heart's content.
I played the part of the serious man,
and he was the madman.
So I was happy to interrupt him
and say:
'' Look here, there's no logic in that.''
And he would go in another direction.
He was never out of imagination
or madness.
When the first part was completed,
we went through the whole story.
Alejandro's well-organized brain
was very useful...
...in keeping track of everything.
I made notes of dialogue
and the scenes.
It took four to six hours
to do a 60-page album.
We did the six volumes like that.
That is extremely unusual because
everything was done in one go:
the story, the scenes, the dialogue.
Working with comic strip designers
is a delight.
They love their art.
It is a commercial art,;
they are paid by the page.
It can be laborious, but they
are as delicate as jewelers.
The relationship is different
according to their personality.
You have to propose stories
they can love.
If you succeed in reaching
their world...
...the collaboration
can be wonderful.
Alejandro knows how to keep...
his personal obsessions...
...and be receptive to each
designer's sensitivity...
...at the same time.
That's part of his genius.
He gives them their appropriate
fuel in the form of scenarios.
We start with a small thing...
...and suddenly it starts to take on
unexpected proportions of grandeur.
Hurrah for greatness!
We have to see Man
in all his weakness.
We have a brain that can go
across the universe,
but we can also shit like a baby,
like my professor.
He goes from a state of diarrhea
to that of the most sublime thoughts.
It is not autobiographical because
this professor is impotent...
...and I have five children.
But on the other hand,
parts of him are like me,
the splendid and ridiculous side
of the philosopher.
Today, I am in a bad mood.
I don't know why,
but I am in an awful mood.
I don't want to be anyone's
spiritual master.
If that is what people are
projecting on me,
because of my age, my white hair,
that's their problem.
I don't accept it.
I give my lecture of Wednesdays,
that's all.
Take me as I am.
Some people think
that I am a crook,
others the head of a sect.
I begin the lecture with an OM.
We've done Om, which in French
means ''man,'' so let's do ''woman.''
''Woman.''
It's not Sanskrit.
We are not a sect.
That is the sound needed...
...to induce calm
before the lecture begins.
I could say ''Coca-Cola'';
it would be the same thing.
One day I told myself that I came
to this world...
...not only to accomplish for myself
but also to give something back.
There are already people
working with...
...humanitarian or charity
organizations,
but there is also an enormous
emotional catastrophe on the planet.
There is a village,
which is hidden in the shadow
of a mountain.
Everybody is suffering
from the lack of light.
One day the eldest of this village
heads for the mountain...
...with a teaspoon in his hands.
The others ask him
what he intends to do.
He replies that he is going to
move the mountain.
'' But you will never succeed!''
they cry out.
'' No, I will never succeed,
but somebody has to start!''
So, like this man
with a teaspoon,
I started to cure
the emotional illness of mankind.
I said I would give
a lecture per week...
...as long as the participants
contributed to paying the rent...
...at the end of each lecture.
Well, they have been paying
for 14 years now!
A seminarist asks another:
'' How can you smoke
during the prayers?
It is strictly forbidden!''
The other replies:
''Well, it is easy.
I asked for permission to pray
while smoking!''
In the book I wrote in '83 I spoke
of Alejandro as a spiritual father.
He gave me answers
no one else could give.
For each question he had an answer.
He encouraged me to write this book
despite the fact...
...that I am not a writer.
I didn't find my life
particularly interesting.
But I wrote and wrote,
and eventually it was published.
From then on I have felt
more at ease with myself...
with my family, my mother...
and my normal agressiveness.
It was like an undigested meal
I had to vomit on paper.
Now I really feel better.
The only answer I had for violence
was violence,
yet humor can be just as effective--
though I don't have much.
Alejandro taught me that giving up
a useless fight...
...is not necessarily
self-devaluating.
If you're going to fight,
the adversary must be worthwhile.
As he said, when I give
karate lessons,
and I give 25 lessons a week,
I am paid.
So if I get angry in a traffic jam
and I start fighting,
it is as if I am giving
a free lesson.
So it's not worth it!
Damn, damn, damn,
I am no more than shit,
and don't tell me I am something.
This cruelty helped me to go
further into myself.
I knew I was poetic,
but I was afraid...
...of certain strong
and strange feelings.
This excess and violence
in Alejandro moved me.
Let's do this.
I follow her and she follows me.
We did a very peculiar massage.
15 people
were gathered together.
Alejandro's students were learning
massage and working on the ego.
We were ready to experiment
with adventures of...
...physical and psychological caress.
For awakening!
So this massage was very special...
...in the sense that everybody there
became a member of my family.
You are my grandfather,
you are my grandmother,
you are my dad, you are my brother,
you are my sister!
We had contact for an hour.
When the contact was over,
this strange experience
immediately became real.
In the end, everybody was
entirely absorbed in their role.
We switched off the lights.
I have to say thatAlejandro
was absent.
I was alone with these people.
I was panic-stricken at this moment,
but that quickly disappeared.
I don't really know what happened,
but everybody was moved.
Because in the dark,
it was really something else.
It went on and on.
In the end, we were really
in a strange mood.
It began to reach proportions
no one expected.
So, at the end of this contact,
I disposed the people in the room
in the form of a spaceship.
Some people were
the hull of the spaceship:
others were the engines,
others were the sensitive organs.
It was an act of science fiction!
Then, when everybody was ready,
playing the role of the father and
the engine of the ship,
the mother, and the envelope,
the grandmother and the radar,
the grandfather and the armament,
the brother was a sort of pilot-fish
for this spaceship.
So we were all ready...
...after this unbelievable massage!
Everybody started to believe
in their roles.
The spaceship was complete,
and I was the passenger...
...and the captain of it.
I gave the destination, which was
the center of the universe,
the return to the eternal father.
It started like that,
and we took this trip.
All the people who participated
in this little psycho-drama,
this psycho-situation,
benefitted from it.
They helped me by giving me the
strength to go through this adventure.
On the other hand,
they accompanied me,
and would not have experienced
such an adventure without me.
It was a real exchange.
When it was all over,
Alejandro was called in,
and he asked how it went.
We answered that it went okay!
That shows Alejandro's delicacy.
There is no power-taking.
There is a real sense of giving.
I am sure that when he was in
the house next door,
he was probably reading a book...
...praying for things to go well.
ButAlejandro is not superstitious.
This is ''psycho-magic''.
I would call it modern medicine.
It is a continuation of
my artistic work,
and I don't see why an artist
shouldn't be interested in therapy.
With the years, I realized that
all my problems,
and all our problems,
originate from the way we were born.
And the way we were born
depends on...
...the relationship between
the father and the mother.
And the emotional relationship
between the father and the mother...
...depends on the relationship
between the grandparents.
The grandparents' actions depend on
the great-grandparents' ideas,
on religion, economy.
In fact, all our ideas come from
our great-grandparents.
I realized that we had
a family unconscious,
we were a family tree.
I also realized that there were at
least 15 people thinking through me,
my parents, my uncles and aunts,
my grandparents,
my great-grandparents,
with all the family around--
I am a thinking family.
My illnesses are created
by my family.
My behavior, the way I live,
my conception of money,
my emotional and sexual
relationships,
are all created by my family.
Indeed, the psychological and
genetic field I come from...
...marks my whole life.
So, if I want
to understand myself,
I have to understand
my family tree,
because I am permanently possessed,
as in voodoo,
by someone of my family.
How did you find that out?
Little by little,
by reading the Tarot to people.
Not intellectually.
Progressively, by seeking the origin
of people's problems,
I suddenly saw the complete
family tree in front of me.
In his autobiography,jung speaks
about the family tree.
It is the only tract I found
of somebody...
...speaking about the family tree.
I don't know if you know this text.
- Shall I read it to you?
- Read it!
'As I was working on my family tree,
I understood the strange communion
of destiny...
...that linked me to my ancestors.
I had the strong feeling that I was
under the influence...
...of events and problems
left incomplete...
...and unresolved by my parents,
my grandparents,
and my other ancestors.
It seems to me that often
in a family...
...there is an impersonal karma
transmitted from parents to children.
I always thought that I had to
answer questions...
...already asked to my ancestors,
or that I had to finish,
or just continue...
...with problems
previously unsolved.''
Yes,jung is absolutely right,
but he is timid.
He has intuition,
he speaks about himself,
but he has to apply what he says
to all mankind.
We must take our problems in hand
and work on them.
jung usually saw things,
but didn't go into them.
I think the reason for this is the
lack of the masculine archetype.
There is no father
anywhere near him.
Exploring the family tree means
engaging in a fierce battle...
...with the monster, like a nightmare,
so that the monster can give you
the treasure.
The family tree is a real nightmare,
where we find sadomasochism
everywhere,
narcissism everywhere,
self-hatred everywhere.
So, with this excrement that is
our family tree,
we have to produce
the treasure gold.
Have you any brothers?
Yes, you who is filming me!
Do you have any problems?
Like everybody.
So you have problems.
Do you want to do it?
As you are filming me,
now I am going to film you!
- With pleasure.
- Yes?
Are you sure
you want to do it?
Do you want to work on
an emotional level?
Yes, why not?
Working with you on an emotional
level will be a total struggle.
There, we will have a man
full of defenses,
because he is filming somebody
else's life and not his own.
Now you are going to be
the lead actor in your movie! Okay?
That is my longtime dream.
- What is your first name?
- Louis.
Place three cards
without turning them over.
I think everybody should do that.
Otherwise we will never
understand ourselves.
One thinks one is an individual.
But, even when we cut ties
with our family,
we carry it, that's the problem.
In 1953, I cut ties with my family,
and that remained
for all my life.
My mother is dead.
I had a terrible relationship
with her.
She had many problems with my
father, and she never caressed me.
So I didn't have a mother
who touched me.
So when I was 23, I left Chile and
threw my address book in the sea.
I never called my father
or my mother.
It was over forever.
When I was 50, I had a dream.
I saw my mother lying in a sofa
telling me:
''Alejandro, I'm dying.''
So I told her that,
since she was dying,
we had to solve all our problems.
She explained
why she hadn't touched me,
and I explained what I felt.
I told her that, after all,
the mother is an important person
in one's life.
We spoke
and we sealed the wounds...
When I woke up, I told my wife:
'' Listen, my mother is dying.
I am going to send a letter...
...to my sister who lives with her
to be read to my mother.''
So I summarized the dream,
spoke about her values
and wrote to my sister:
''I send you this letter.
If it arrives too late,
read it in front of mother's grave.''
The letter arrived
one day after her death.
It was true that she was dying.
Then I realized
that in our unconscious...
...the persons are always alive.
The dead live with us...
Let's see a tree in action.
Don't think. Look and let yourself
be guided by your unconscious.
Look around and say:
''This is my father!''
Moebius. That's what comes to me.
Your father!
With or without shoes?
As he is.
Your mother?
Madam?
Are you sure?
I have chosen.
You are chosen. Don't be shy.
Do you like the way she is dressed?
Very much.
Your father and your mother.
I would see the father
a bit in retreat,
and the mother in front,
but not too much.
Okay. Where do you place yourself?
- Spontaneously, here.
- Okay, that's understood.
You had problems
when you were born.
You must see clearly
the circumstances of your birth.
- You mean my physical birth?
- Yes, your physical birth.
I was born prematurely
by caesarian operation.
That's the problem at birth.
And the only son.
Move the mother there,
so she can have room...
Who is the mother of your mother?
You in the audience do it
in your head. That's how we work!
The lady in the red jacket.
The mother of your mother.
Was there any important brother
or sister in your mother's family?
There were four sisters and
a brother that seems important to me...
...as he died in a hunting accident.
How old was he when he died?
I think he was 16.
That's important.
What seems important to me is that...
...he had the same Christian name
as my father.
His name was Gian-Carlo:
my father's was Charles.
As if by chance!
Bring the brother and I will
immediately explain...
...what this is all about.
For me this is common. The name
implies a series of meanings.
Where is the boy?
Where do you see him?
You, with the pink scarf.
He died in a hunting accident.
Who killed him?
I think that my grandfather
provoked the accident.
A bullet by ricochet.
He is the one who killed him.
Unconsciously.
In this family,
whom did your mother admire?
- Her father.
- The father is very important.
We should put him up on a chair,
but we cannot.
He forms a couple with the daughter.
And the mother,
where do you place her?
I would place her on the other side.
Somewhere there, a bit behind,
maybe.just like that!
What is the role of the boy?
I would place him there.
In place of your father?
He has the same name
as your father!
Strange isn't it?
That's your mother's family.
Your father's now.
You see we are just beginning
to scratch the surface.
In the beginning
we don't see anything,
so we have to scratch more.
You, if you please.
Your dad's mom.
Please come, madam, and thank you
for your participation.
Where are you going to place her?
Here.
He is very close to his mother.
- Quite.
- Very important.
And your dad's dad?
You, with the red shirt.
Do you want to participate?
Okay, come.
Where are you going to place
this father?
I would place him just behind
my father, so he's not seen.
Because, although he has exactly
the same name as me,
Louis Mouchet, I never saw him,
- I was never told anything about him.
- Is he erased?
Totally erased.
So I would place him behind.
This one is not in the dark.
This one is more present.
My mother used to speak a lot
about him.
Is mother in the background?
No, not at all.
But she worships her father.
And her mother, is she erased?
Her mother is less present,
but not as absent
as my father's father.
Sit down to let the audience see.
There is a nucleus
that we are going to see.
Right? A family secret.
We have here, according to what
he insinuated,
an accident, a semi-murder,
as his own father killed him.
That almost reaches the dimension
of Greek tragedy.
Here, he is
close to a strong mother,
as your mom relates more
to her father.
Mother has a masculine archetype
injected into her.
Dad has a female archetype in him.
That means that things are crossed.
He bears the woman in him,
she bears the man in her.
According to what you said,
I am going to interpret, slowly.
You are absolutely right.
My father said it textually:
''I am the feminine man, and you
are the masculine woman.''
He said it in a letter to my mother.
His father said:
''I am the feminine man and you
are the masculine woman.''
It was already said in the family.
This archetypal male provider...
provider of subsistence...
provider of material means...
it looks like you never knew.
Tell us how they die.
How did your father die?
Throat cancer.
You realize that there is
an emotional nucleus hidden here.
That means that your father
didn't express his emotions.
I say that at the risk of making
an enormous mistake.
They were two. My uncle died
from exactly the same illness.
His brother?
They were born on the same day.
Was he older or younger?
Younger.
He imitated his brother.
That means that the two formed
a couple.
Because there were no adults
to take care of them.
It is a progression.
That's why you are making
this film on me.
You are profoundly seeking
the paternal archetype.
That's why I tell you
that the father is absent.
I say that because you move
from the real father...
...to the spiritual one
and the spiritual father...
...to the mythical one.
They are the symbols of the father.
The Emperor, the Pope,
and the Sun are all symbols,
which grow in amplitude.
Herein lies an emotional knot
which is not expressed.
Because of this, as a man,
he'll have problems
expressing his emotions.
That's your heritage!
I'll cope with that!
How old were you
when your father passed away?
I was 22.
What did you feel at that moment?
Was everything said?
Or did things remain unsaid?
The first thing that comes to me
about my father's death?
Well, he had cancer;
a long and painful illness,
and he suffered a lot.
How old were you
when he began to suffer?
When it was diagnosed
I was 21 .
Then it lasted for a year.
But I think that his pain began
before the illness broke out.
And what is
even more striking...
...about the moment of death
is that,
suddenly I saw an expression
of peace on his face...
...that I had never seen before
in my life.
All of a sudden there was peace
and ecstasy on his face...
that I had never seen.
- Yes.
- It was the moment of death.
Unbelievable.
It is beautiful because it
softens the death.
But it is unbelievable
to be on this planet...
...and choose a father
that never showed...
...a peaceful face
in all your life.
You have to see him dead
to understand...
...that he is in peace.
For him, life was--
It was enormous suffering.
Living is suffering.
He is the son of a father
who transmits to him...
...that life is great suffering.
That's the first thing
to be clarified.
What was your father's profession?
His vocation was a poet.
So he was an artist.
That's why you chose Moebius.
But poets don't make
a lot of money.
To live, he had
a private school.
He was a teacher and had
his own school...
...equivalent to the beginning
of college level.
For children?
Not young children.
Teenagers.
And he taught literature?
He managed the school and
taught literature and Latin.
But above all he wanted
to be a poet?
He is a poet. His work exists.
Do you like his work?
Was he a good poet?
Huh-- In the beginning,
I had trouble liking it.
I couldn't read it like
poems of Baudelaire...
...or Rimbaud.
I had tremendous difficulty
in the beginning.
Why was it so difficult?
Because of all this.
Because he didn't
communicate with you.
He was like a lone traveler,
in poetry.
Yes, that might be
the explanation.
I had the feeling that
in his poetry lies...
...what he couldn't
communicate to me.
And, as a result, I didn't
want to love his poeticwork.
Did you go to his school?
I went to do my homework,
after school.
So he was not with you.
No, he wasn't with me.
He didn't have an affectionate
relationship with me.
- Being an only child--
- Except that from time to time--
As the only child,
strange, isn't it?
- That's strange.
- Wait. Wait.
- That's strange.
- Often--
It could be worse.
Often the only relationship
he had with me...
...was giving lessons
or checking my homework.
Nothing affective.
Or, when he was
completely drunk,
we would go to the cafes
to fool around.
Alcohol! He was closed.
He couldn't express
his emotions.
Take your father by the hands
and speak to him.
Ask him what was missing.
Face him.
What was missing?
Speak to him directly!
To accomplish totally--
No, no, speak to him,
he's your father.
I would say. To accomplish
totally your poeticwork.
And, speaking of myself,
to love me totally,
to express the love that...
...I'm sure you did feel
for me deep inside.
I couldn't speak to you
directly,
that's why I used poetry.
So I will read your poetry...
...and try to understand
your message.
- Didn't you read his poetry?
- Yes, but poetry is mysterious.
Maybe I didn't understand
his message.
You have to read my poetry
as being addressed to you.
Okay.
Wait! Wait!
No, no, you must protest.
If I were you,
I wouldn't accept that.
But I don't want to protest,
I accept what you are
telling me.
I have to help you.
I am speaking to the father.
I know,
but I have to help you.
In this case poetry
is his rival,
because his father gives
all his passion to poetry,
not to him.
Wait, wait, wait.
You risk finding yourself
with an alien woman...
...who is going to give all
her love to singing,
not to you, and you are
going to love her...
...because she is totally
dedicated to her art.
And you will follow her,
like you followed your father,
who was dedicated to his art.
Art is the rival for you.
I am doing something
extremely magical for you.
You followed me with my work,
but suddenly I come out
of the work and I am facing you.
- That's revolutionary in your life.
- That's right.
This is the first time that
the father, the artist,
the poet is facing you
and cares about you.
I do not care about myself.
I am not mimicking for the camera.
You are important.
Ask your father to care
about you, besides poetry.
When will somebody care
about you?
How long are you going to be
a public person?
When are you going
to be yourself?
When will somebody look at you
as a human being?
What I want to say
to my father is:
why did you need poetry?
Why didn't you
talk to me directly?
A form of autism.
By talking directly to me,
I think you could have
overcome that.
Express yourself.
Now is the time!
I am sorry.
Regrets are useless.
Now he begins
to express himself!.
Regrets are of no use.
That's what he never did!
I would take a book
of my father's and burn it.
Keeping one, of course.
But I would take one copy
and burn it.
That's what I'd do
as a psycho-magic act.
Because that is my rival,
that's enough!
This way I'll be able
to release my anger.
In all this lies a quest
for love.
We ask the father why,
what was missing...
...and when we join the father,
we find that it is
a need for love.
All our anger against
our family...
...lies in misplaced
and unsatisfied love.
But when we reach this state...
...where we can express
ourselves and communicate,
everything vanishes.
The tree couldn't bear fruit because
the productive passage was clogged.
Now the tree can grow.
There is no prejudice...
... no childishness.
We all become mature,
artists accomplish themselves,
money comes, and the fear
of money vanishes.
Thank you!
