1
00:00:36,936 --> 00:00:38,198
Yeah!

2
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:29,408
Ew!

3
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:30,973
Hey, Billy, look...

4
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:32,644
Ah.

5
00:02:34,287 --> 00:02:36,755
Are you all right, Billy?

6
00:02:51,638 --> 00:02:53,663
Wrapping it up
there, Billy?

7
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,473
Maybe not.

8
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:10,386
Okay, careful there, Woody.

9
00:03:10,423 --> 00:03:12,015
You're gonna knock
somebody over.

10
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,297
Billy...
Oh!

11
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:21,926
Billy, you know what?
I am saying stop.

12
00:03:21,968 --> 00:03:24,232
This is your room, come on.

13
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,500
- I don't like it.
- Why not?

14
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:29,235
Smell the walls.

15
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:36,437
Mm... yeah.

16
00:03:36,482 --> 00:03:38,313
You know what?
They just need a fresh coat of paint.

17
00:03:38,351 --> 00:03:40,512
You can pick the color.

18
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:42,453
- Black.
- Black?

19
00:03:42,488 --> 00:03:44,581
Cozy.

20
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:46,649
I don't wanna go
to school, Mom.

21
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,457
I'm gonna be the new kid.
It's the worst thing ever.

22
00:03:49,495 --> 00:03:51,326
How will I even
know where to go?

23
00:03:51,364 --> 00:03:52,854
We'll figure it out.

24
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,333
We? No.
No mothers.

25
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:57,165
I want to meet
your teacher Mrs. Bommley.

26
00:03:57,203 --> 00:03:58,602
No, no mothers.

27
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:00,902
And I want to see your classroom and
just make sure that everything's okay.

28
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,601
No mothers.

29
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,803
And also, Mom,

30
00:04:04,844 --> 00:04:06,812
don't put anything in
my lunch like a little note

31
00:04:06,846 --> 00:04:08,609
saying, "Good luck, Billy."

32
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,582
Don't worry, I won't.

33
00:04:12,185 --> 00:04:15,018
Okay, unpack, all right?
You're gonna feel so much better

34
00:04:15,054 --> 00:04:17,352
once you get settled in
and get all your toys out.

35
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:19,881
Toys?

36
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,588
Material possessions.

37
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:53,990
Joe, Joe, look!
There's a new kid

38
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:56,757
and he's riding his
bike on the sidewalk.

39
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:59,697
- Look! Boiler Head!
- Dismount, young man.

40
00:04:59,732 --> 00:05:03,361
"And walk your bicycle.
Walk your bicycle."

41
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:08,272
Everybody,

42
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,639
stare at him.

43
00:05:27,293 --> 00:05:30,228
Billy F, is that where
you're putting your bike?

44
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,925
- It's a bike rack.
- It's a bike rack.

45
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,835
- Billy F?
- Yeah, Billy F.

46
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,963
Billy F.

47
00:05:40,006 --> 00:05:42,338
See you around, new kid.

48
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,885
Mrs. Bommley and Isaac...

49
00:05:58,925 --> 00:06:01,519
No! No, wait!

50
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:06,363
Aw, you stupid note.

51
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:12,562
Say you were lost.

52
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,402
I'm not lost.

53
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,273
Say you were though.

54
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:20,040
Okay, say I was.

55
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,774
Follow me.

56
00:06:26,252 --> 00:06:28,516
Sorry, I'm so tall.

57
00:06:32,825 --> 00:06:34,759
- Erk, Erk, Erk!
- Incoming!

58
00:06:34,794 --> 00:06:36,989
- Incoming
- Coming in.

59
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,553
- Erk, Erk.
- Erk, Erk

60
00:06:38,598 --> 00:06:41,294
Erk, Erk!

61
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:45,134
Put your stuff in there, and that's
our classroom in there.

62
00:06:45,171 --> 00:06:47,935
- Erk, Erk.
- Everyone calls that girl Erk.

63
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:51,410
- Erk?
- Erika.

64
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:55,476
No hats allowed.

65
00:07:01,421 --> 00:07:04,720
Uh, please don't
make me go in there.

66
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:08,184
Ow!

67
00:07:08,227 --> 00:07:11,822
Oh!

68
00:07:11,864 --> 00:07:14,458
Come, young man.

69
00:07:20,139 --> 00:07:21,629
Sweet.

70
00:07:21,674 --> 00:07:24,336
Class, you have a new
student joining you today.

71
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:26,971
Everyone, let's welcome
Billy with a warm hello.

72
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:32,845
- Class?
- Hello, Billy.

73
00:07:33,853 --> 00:07:36,048
You're late.

74
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,487
Get to your seats.

75
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:41,482
Would you write your name
on the board, young man?

76
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:50,493
Billy Forrester,
with two Rs.

77
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:53,130
- Three.
- I beg your pardon?

78
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:54,901
There's three Rs.

79
00:07:58,945 --> 00:08:01,140
Thank you, Mr. Burdock.

80
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:03,148
Welcome, Billy.

81
00:08:03,182 --> 00:08:06,845
As part of our curriculum,
we are studying Ancient Egypt.

82
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:11,721
Oh!

83
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,351
Thus the Sphinx,
thus the pyramids,

84
00:08:14,393 --> 00:08:18,159
thus the bust
of Nefertiti.

85
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:19,824
Now, would you like
to sit, Billy?

86
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,027
Let's see,
let's find you a seat.

87
00:08:22,068 --> 00:08:24,298
How about right there,
in back of Erika?

88
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:27,500
Erk, Erk.

89
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:30,532
Tomorrow, make sure
you put your backpack in the cubby,

90
00:08:30,576 --> 00:08:33,067
and welcome!

91
00:08:33,112 --> 00:08:34,704
Erk, Erk.

92
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:38,342
- Erk.
- Erk, Erk, Erk.

93
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:08,077
Hey, have
a delicious lunch.

94
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:36,371
Woo-hoo!

95
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:44,182
Hey!
Hey, Billy F.

96
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,309
That's your lunch, huh?
You eat worms?

97
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,786
I eat them all the time.

98
00:09:54,827 --> 00:09:57,057
You want to try one?

99
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,029
Here you go.

100
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:05,929
Somebody get this
off of me!

101
00:10:05,972 --> 00:10:08,440
He's gonna get it now.

102
00:10:15,848 --> 00:10:17,748
Everyone sit!

103
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:47,340
Boiler Head.

104
00:11:01,425 --> 00:11:04,087
- He's gonna get it.
- Look at that.

105
00:11:04,127 --> 00:11:07,119
I'm popular!

106
00:11:07,164 --> 00:11:09,132
Woody, tell Billy and Daddy
what you did today.

107
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:10,963
The pre-school kids
are called sea turtles

108
00:11:11,001 --> 00:11:13,162
- and when they introduced Woody...
- I sang a song!

109
00:11:13,203 --> 00:11:15,137
He did. He stood right up
when they introduced him

110
00:11:15,172 --> 00:11:16,969
and he sang his little heart out,
didn't you?

111
00:11:17,007 --> 00:11:18,565
Oh, yeah?
What song did you sing, Woody?

112
00:11:18,609 --> 00:11:22,375
# Baby beluga
in the deep blue sea #

113
00:11:22,412 --> 00:11:26,041
# Swims so wild
and swims so free #

114
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,950
# Heaven above,
sea below #

115
00:11:28,986 --> 00:11:32,979
# And the little
white whale on the go... #

116
00:11:33,023 --> 00:11:35,218
Stop! No more!

117
00:11:35,259 --> 00:11:37,523
He's just singing, Billy.

118
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:39,324
He's not just singing.

119
00:11:39,363 --> 00:11:41,228
He's deliberately
not stopping!

120
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:42,698
# The waves roll in #

121
00:11:42,733 --> 00:11:45,201
# The waves roll out... #

122
00:11:45,235 --> 00:11:47,931
# See the water
squirting out of my spout. #

123
00:11:56,346 --> 00:11:58,109
- Dad?
- Billy, hey.

124
00:11:58,148 --> 00:11:59,581
Couldn't tell
if you were asleep.

125
00:11:59,616 --> 00:12:03,177
My brain's keeping me awake.

126
00:12:04,788 --> 00:12:07,621
What's the headline
in that brain of yours?

127
00:12:12,062 --> 00:12:13,757
I don't like my school.

128
00:12:13,797 --> 00:12:17,597
Yeah, well, Billy,
first days are tough.

129
00:12:17,634 --> 00:12:20,728
First days can be really hard.
You should have seen me at work today.

130
00:12:20,771 --> 00:12:23,740
You know, I, uh, I couldn't
keep anyone's name straight.

131
00:12:23,774 --> 00:12:25,105
Thanks, I'll be right
with you, Bob.

132
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:27,508
It's Rob, Rob Simon.

133
00:12:29,012 --> 00:12:31,139
And then they made
me wear a name tag.

134
00:12:31,181 --> 00:12:34,309
This is your IMB badge. You're gonna
need this when you go over to VOD

135
00:12:34,351 --> 00:12:36,285
because they're gonna
ask for it for IOC.

136
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,151
Anything like that
happen to you?

137
00:12:46,196 --> 00:12:48,061
Not really.

138
00:12:48,098 --> 00:12:49,497
Did you make any friends?

139
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:51,763
Everybody is already friends.

140
00:12:51,802 --> 00:12:53,895
They all went
to kindergarten probably.

141
00:12:53,937 --> 00:12:56,804
And I'm just this kid who's
just there all of a sudden.

142
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,102
Well, you know what you do?

143
00:12:58,141 --> 00:13:00,006
You go up to people, you take
the initiative, you say,

144
00:13:00,043 --> 00:13:03,570
- "Hi, I'm Billy Forrester."
- Say my last name?

145
00:13:03,613 --> 00:13:05,547
My point is, you don't wait
for them to come to you, okay?

146
00:13:05,582 --> 00:13:07,948
You go up to them, introduce
yourself, shake hands.

147
00:13:07,985 --> 00:13:11,113
Kids don't shake hands, Dad.

148
00:13:12,589 --> 00:13:14,318
Try and get some sleep.

149
00:13:14,358 --> 00:13:16,417
You know, things are gonna get
better, I promise.

150
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,587
You watch, tomorrow

151
00:13:18,628 --> 00:13:21,119
you're gonna have
a great day.

152
00:13:39,082 --> 00:13:42,711
Wormboy! Wormboy!

153
00:13:42,753 --> 00:13:46,189
- Wormboy! Wormboy!
- Stop!

154
00:13:46,223 --> 00:13:48,657
- Wormboy!
- Get away!

155
00:13:48,692 --> 00:13:51,388
- Wormboy! Wormboy!
- Get off!

156
00:13:51,428 --> 00:13:53,225
Wormboy!

157
00:13:53,263 --> 00:13:55,026
Stop! Get off!

158
00:13:55,065 --> 00:13:58,057
We're just calling you Wormboy
'cause that's what you said.

159
00:13:58,101 --> 00:14:00,035
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

160
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:02,698
You said, "I eat worms."
Right? Right?

161
00:14:02,739 --> 00:14:04,263
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

162
00:14:04,307 --> 00:14:05,968
So, you're Wormboy.

163
00:14:08,678 --> 00:14:11,169
Wormboy.

164
00:14:11,214 --> 00:14:13,273
We'll get back with you
at recess.

165
00:14:16,186 --> 00:14:19,417
Oh, hey. Hey, does your house have
a front door that's green?

166
00:14:19,456 --> 00:14:21,583
I was trying to figure out
where you live 'cause my house

167
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,855
has a red door with
a sign that says Tansey.

168
00:14:23,894 --> 00:14:25,885
That's my name,
Erika Tansey.

169
00:14:25,929 --> 00:14:28,762
You're making it worse.

170
00:14:51,488 --> 00:14:53,854
I'm Adam Simms.

171
00:14:55,592 --> 00:14:58,322
I used to be friends
with Frasier Boone.

172
00:14:58,361 --> 00:15:00,955
You know Frasier Boone?

173
00:15:00,997 --> 00:15:04,160
I don't know anybody, okay?

174
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:07,796
That's like me.
No friends.

175
00:15:07,838 --> 00:15:09,738
I have lots of friends.

176
00:15:09,773 --> 00:15:12,469
They just don't go
to this dumb school.

177
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:14,409
Hey,

178
00:15:14,444 --> 00:15:17,277
you know how you threw a worm
at Joe Guire and hit him in the face?

179
00:15:17,314 --> 00:15:18,906
What about it?

180
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:21,782
I thought for sure he was gonna smash
you with the death ring.

181
00:15:21,818 --> 00:15:23,615
The death ring?

182
00:15:23,653 --> 00:15:26,781
Joe has a ring called
the death ring.

183
00:15:26,823 --> 00:15:29,417
If he punches you with it,
you die.

184
00:15:29,459 --> 00:15:31,757
But you don't die now.

185
00:15:31,795 --> 00:15:34,320
You die in eighth grade,
so nobody can prove it.

186
00:15:34,364 --> 00:15:36,559
It's got poison in it

187
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,091
that goes into your skin
and makes an ulcer.

188
00:15:39,136 --> 00:15:41,764
Very slowly
you bleed to death.

189
00:15:41,805 --> 00:15:43,739
If he punches you with it?

190
00:15:45,075 --> 00:15:47,873
He punched me.
And in the eight grade...

191
00:15:47,911 --> 00:15:50,209
I'm gonna be dead.

192
00:15:51,681 --> 00:15:53,706
What did you do to make him
punch you in the first place?

193
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,115
Nothing.

194
00:15:55,152 --> 00:15:58,485
He just said I was annoying
him for some reason.

195
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:02,688
Uh, how hard
did he punch you?

196
00:16:02,726 --> 00:16:06,025
Really really hard.
Like this...

197
00:16:08,064 --> 00:16:09,861
And then I fell
down like this.

198
00:16:12,068 --> 00:16:15,595
And it made a mark
right here

199
00:16:15,639 --> 00:16:18,199
where the poison went in.

200
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,873
Ugh!

201
00:16:30,787 --> 00:16:32,584
Ugh!

202
00:16:41,331 --> 00:16:44,494
Wormboy! Wormboy!

203
00:16:44,534 --> 00:16:47,298
Wormboy! Wormboy!

204
00:16:47,337 --> 00:16:51,603
Wormboy!
Wormboy!

205
00:16:51,641 --> 00:16:55,543
Wormboy! Wormboy!

206
00:16:55,579 --> 00:16:59,276
Wormboy!
Wormboy!

207
00:16:59,316 --> 00:17:00,715
You guys are stupid!

208
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,275
You can say Wormboy
all you want.

209
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,753
I don't care!

210
00:17:04,788 --> 00:17:06,619
Worms don't even
taste hardly.

211
00:17:06,656 --> 00:17:09,682
I had a whole bowl for breakfast
with brown sugar and cold milk.

212
00:17:09,726 --> 00:17:11,216
That's a lie.

213
00:17:11,261 --> 00:17:14,253
Sometimes I boil them.
Sometimes I do them on the barbecue.

214
00:17:14,297 --> 00:17:16,765
My favorite way,
fried like French fries.

215
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:20,327
The greasier and the slimier
the better.

216
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:22,463
Wormboy, you couldn't
even eat one worm.

217
00:17:22,505 --> 00:17:24,097
Right when it touched
your tongue you'd puke.

218
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:27,303
- You want to bet?
- The smell would make you puke.

219
00:17:27,344 --> 00:17:28,971
You couldn't even eat
a quarter of a worm.

220
00:17:29,012 --> 00:17:32,277
I can eat this many worms, Joe.
10 easy!

221
00:17:32,315 --> 00:17:35,182
And you would be the one
who'd puke just watching me.

222
00:17:36,753 --> 00:17:39,051
Let's bet.

223
00:17:39,089 --> 00:17:41,455
That I would eat 10 worms?

224
00:17:41,491 --> 00:17:44,289
Yeah, and when you
throw up you lose.

225
00:17:44,327 --> 00:17:47,490
- Yeah.
- What if I don't lose?

226
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,589
- What's the bet, you mean?
- I know.

227
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:51,965
The loser has
to come to school

228
00:17:52,002 --> 00:17:55,267
with worms in his pants.

229
00:17:55,305 --> 00:17:57,899
Yeah, and he has to walk
down the hall

230
00:17:57,941 --> 00:17:59,465
past everybody.

231
00:17:59,509 --> 00:18:02,239
All right.
It's gonna be you Wormboy.

232
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:05,009
But Joe, what if he
eats a tiny bit of worm,

233
00:18:05,048 --> 00:18:08,142
and then a year later
a tiny bit more of a worm...

234
00:18:08,184 --> 00:18:11,153
No, you gotta eat all
10 worms, all on the same day.

235
00:18:11,187 --> 00:18:14,088
- And I get to pick them.
- When?

236
00:18:14,124 --> 00:18:15,785
This Saturday.

237
00:18:15,825 --> 00:18:18,157
That's the day after tomorrow.

238
00:18:18,194 --> 00:18:19,752
I need more time to get ready.

239
00:18:19,796 --> 00:18:22,822
Backing out?
Come on, Wormboy, shake on it.

240
00:18:22,866 --> 00:18:25,960
Kids don't shake hands.

241
00:18:26,002 --> 00:18:27,867
I said, shake on it!

242
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:38,375
It's a bet.

243
00:18:46,823 --> 00:18:48,347
Oh!

244
00:18:51,861 --> 00:18:53,795
- Hey, Mitch.
- Hey.

245
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:57,266
- I had a thought. You play tennis?
- Yup.

246
00:18:57,300 --> 00:19:00,098
- How about Helen?
- Yeah. Yeah we both play tennis.

247
00:19:00,136 --> 00:19:02,127
You gotta come down to our club.
We'll play some doubles.

248
00:19:02,172 --> 00:19:04,697
That's be great, Rob.

249
00:19:04,741 --> 00:19:06,732
Great.

250
00:19:08,745 --> 00:19:11,077
You and I, we played tennis
when we first met a couple of times.

251
00:19:11,114 --> 00:19:14,777
- You were good.
- Yeah, compared to you I was.

252
00:19:14,818 --> 00:19:18,379
It's not that he asked me.
It's the way he asked me.

253
00:19:20,123 --> 00:19:23,422
Like he was testing me.

254
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,233
Why are you
looking at that?

255
00:19:34,404 --> 00:19:37,840
Joe Guire told me to.

256
00:19:37,874 --> 00:19:39,808
"Find out about worms,"
he said.

257
00:19:39,843 --> 00:19:41,367
That's what they
look like inside?

258
00:19:41,411 --> 00:19:44,209
Yeah.
They have brains.

259
00:19:44,247 --> 00:19:48,274
No eyes.
They're blind.

260
00:19:48,318 --> 00:19:50,377
And look, five hearts.

261
00:19:54,591 --> 00:19:56,855
And look at this
interesting detail.

262
00:19:56,893 --> 00:20:00,056
- Sphincter.
- That's the worm's butt.

263
00:20:00,096 --> 00:20:01,757
- Sphincter.
- Sphincter.

264
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:03,959
- Sphincter.
- Sphincter sphincter sphincter!

265
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,900
Stop, you guys!

266
00:20:05,936 --> 00:20:08,598
I have to eat one.

267
00:20:08,638 --> 00:20:10,299
I have to eat 10.

268
00:20:13,176 --> 00:20:14,803
- Sphincter.
- Sphincter.

269
00:20:14,844 --> 00:20:18,541
- Sphincter. Sphincter.
- Sphincter. Sphincter.

270
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:20,812
- Sphincter.
- Boys...

271
00:20:28,825 --> 00:20:31,419
"How the Ancient Egyptians

272
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:33,326
Preserved their Dead."

273
00:20:33,363 --> 00:20:36,025
Fascinating topic, boys.

274
00:20:36,066 --> 00:20:37,727
Fascinating.

275
00:20:37,767 --> 00:20:40,133
The mystery of the Sphinx.

276
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,831
Excellent, excellent.

277
00:20:41,871 --> 00:20:43,930
And on your recess too.

278
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:47,774
Oh, you're to be commended.

279
00:20:47,811 --> 00:20:51,338
Carry on.

280
00:20:53,383 --> 00:20:55,351
- Oh, that was close.
- Yeah.

281
00:20:55,385 --> 00:20:57,046
Excellent, excellent, boys!

282
00:20:57,087 --> 00:20:59,317
Fascinating.
And on your recess too!

283
00:20:59,356 --> 00:21:01,881
The lost sphincter
of the Sphinx.

284
00:21:01,925 --> 00:21:04,621
The lost
sphincter of the Sphinx.

285
00:21:04,661 --> 00:21:06,526
The lost sphinc...

286
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:10,795
You guys are friends
with this guy,

287
00:21:10,834 --> 00:21:13,598
who's gonna be barfing
his guts out tomorrow?

288
00:21:13,637 --> 00:21:16,435
Donny, get over here.

289
00:21:17,707 --> 00:21:20,676
You're not his friend.
He's Wormboy.

290
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:22,837
He doesn't have any friends.

291
00:21:22,879 --> 00:21:24,608
- Bradley.
- Right here, Joe.

292
00:21:24,648 --> 00:21:26,206
Tell him the new rule.

293
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:28,479
All 10 worms must
be eaten by 7:00 P.M.

294
00:21:28,518 --> 00:21:32,045
Or you lose. And Bradley
is the official timekeeper.

295
00:21:32,088 --> 00:21:34,852
Why do you make
all the rules?

296
00:21:34,891 --> 00:21:38,224
Because...
he just does.

297
00:21:38,261 --> 00:21:40,559
You won't even
make it to 7:00.

298
00:21:40,597 --> 00:21:42,929
'Cause we're making
the worms taste bad.

299
00:21:42,966 --> 00:21:46,094
Like they already don't?

300
00:21:46,136 --> 00:21:49,299
Yeah, shut up, Twitch!

301
00:21:49,339 --> 00:21:52,900
You too, Techno Mouth.
Benjy...

302
00:21:52,942 --> 00:21:56,503
Benjy is the official
worm cook.

303
00:21:56,546 --> 00:21:58,741
You're gonna cook the worms?

304
00:21:58,782 --> 00:22:01,080
I'm thinking up some
disgusting recipes.

305
00:22:01,117 --> 00:22:04,575
You're the one that said
you like them fried, Wormboy.

306
00:22:04,621 --> 00:22:07,454
We're making the worms
taste nasty.

307
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:03,743
I see you, so quit hiding.

308
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,907
Just on my way home

309
00:23:05,949 --> 00:23:09,350
and I thought you
might want to know

310
00:23:09,385 --> 00:23:11,046
I might be
leaving this place.

311
00:23:11,087 --> 00:23:14,056
- Is your family moving again?
- No.

312
00:23:14,090 --> 00:23:15,648
Just me.

313
00:23:15,692 --> 00:23:18,889
Is this all because you threw
a worm in Joe Guire's face?

314
00:23:18,928 --> 00:23:22,091
That was really dumb!

315
00:23:22,132 --> 00:23:23,724
Really dumb, wasn't it?

316
00:23:23,767 --> 00:23:25,530
I loved it.

317
00:23:25,568 --> 00:23:29,026
- You loved it?
- Yup, I loved it.

318
00:23:32,942 --> 00:23:35,137
Whoa, you're good.

319
00:23:35,178 --> 00:23:37,646
Thank you.

320
00:23:38,982 --> 00:23:41,576
- Say I knew.
- Knew what?

321
00:23:41,618 --> 00:23:43,984
- About the bet.
- You can't know, you're a girl.

322
00:23:47,991 --> 00:23:49,788
Say I did though.

323
00:23:49,826 --> 00:23:52,454
Say I also know you've never
eaten a worm in your whole life.

324
00:23:52,495 --> 00:23:56,090
- How would you know that?
- Because... why would you?

325
00:24:00,036 --> 00:24:02,027
Did you know
it was tomorrow?

326
00:24:02,071 --> 00:24:05,268
And can I tell
you something?

327
00:24:05,308 --> 00:24:07,674
What?

328
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:10,304
I have a really
weak stomach.

329
00:24:10,346 --> 00:24:11,711
Really weak.

330
00:24:11,748 --> 00:24:13,978
There are a lot
of foods I can't eat.

331
00:24:14,017 --> 00:24:16,508
Then why'd you make the stupid
bet in the first place?

332
00:24:16,553 --> 00:24:18,316
I don't know.

333
00:24:18,354 --> 00:24:20,652
I was just trying to go to school
and be a normal person.

334
00:24:20,690 --> 00:24:22,851
Normal people
don't eat worms, Billy.

335
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:29,123
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, what do you think?

336
00:24:29,165 --> 00:24:30,757
I'm naked.

337
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,927
All right, come on,
we're going out.

338
00:24:32,969 --> 00:24:35,494
- Where?
- Woody's school.

339
00:24:35,538 --> 00:24:37,631
They're doing a performance
and Woody's in it.

340
00:24:37,674 --> 00:24:39,301
We're meeting your dad there.

341
00:24:39,342 --> 00:24:42,038
Come on, I need you
to put on a clean shirt.

342
00:24:42,078 --> 00:24:43,477
What?

343
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,005
Up swim
the sea turtles,

344
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:49,143
up through
the ocean waves.

345
00:24:49,185 --> 00:24:52,245
And then down, down
swim the sea turtles,

346
00:24:52,288 --> 00:24:55,621
dancing on the ocean waves.

347
00:24:55,658 --> 00:24:58,126
Focus, sea turtles.
Focus.

348
00:24:58,161 --> 00:24:59,685
Focus, sweetie.

349
00:24:59,729 --> 00:25:01,788
# Sea turtles #

350
00:25:01,831 --> 00:25:04,163
# And the beluga
in the deep blue sea. #

351
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,135
- No, not... come here.
- Yeah!

352
00:25:07,170 --> 00:25:09,070
Focus! Focus!

353
00:25:14,577 --> 00:25:18,104
I am the greatest. Thank you,
ladies and gentlemen.

354
00:25:21,484 --> 00:25:24,715
Billy!

355
00:25:24,754 --> 00:25:27,746
Hey, what are you doing out here?
They got cake inside.

356
00:25:27,790 --> 00:25:29,257
I don't care.
I don't want any cake.

357
00:25:29,292 --> 00:25:33,092
Don't want... don't want any cake?
Whose son are you?

358
00:25:33,129 --> 00:25:34,460
He's just a showoff, Dad.

359
00:25:34,497 --> 00:25:37,057
And everybody says,
"Oh, he's so cute"

360
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,330
just because he's little.
I hate him.

361
00:25:39,369 --> 00:25:42,497
- You don't hate your brother.
- Yes, I do!

362
00:25:42,538 --> 00:25:44,301
And I hate this town
we have to live in.

363
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,069
And the kids at my school,

364
00:25:46,109 --> 00:25:48,168
- they're all...
- They're just kids, Billy.

365
00:25:48,211 --> 00:25:50,111
They're just kids.
Kids are the same everywhere you go.

366
00:25:50,146 --> 00:25:52,808
No.
No, they aren't.

367
00:25:52,849 --> 00:25:54,407
These kids are different.

368
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,315
Different how?

369
00:25:58,888 --> 00:26:01,322
Nothing.

370
00:26:08,398 --> 00:26:12,266
Billy, your, uh, your mother and I,
we, uh, met this woman inside.

371
00:26:12,302 --> 00:26:15,100
She has a son, Benjy,
he's in your class. You know a Benjy?

372
00:26:15,138 --> 00:26:17,038
I don't know
anybody.

373
00:26:17,073 --> 00:26:20,065
Well, she says... she says they're all
playing soccer this afternoon.

374
00:26:20,109 --> 00:26:21,804
- Soccer?
- Soccer, right.

375
00:26:21,844 --> 00:26:24,438
At the field by the creek.
I'll get directions from her, okay?

376
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,913
No, they didn't
ask me.

377
00:26:25,949 --> 00:26:28,315
Billy, come on, when
they see how good you are,

378
00:26:28,351 --> 00:26:30,785
they'll be begging
you to play.

379
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,344
Mm, I don't have
my cleats.

380
00:26:32,388 --> 00:26:33,855
We'll go home
and get them.

381
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:35,448
Come on, now you're
just making excuses.

382
00:26:35,491 --> 00:26:37,686
You know, you'll go,
you'll have fun.

383
00:26:37,727 --> 00:26:40,355
Look here, have some cake.
It's really...

384
00:26:40,396 --> 00:26:42,728
stale.

385
00:26:42,765 --> 00:26:46,166
- What kind is it?
- Chocolate-covered stale cake.

386
00:26:56,046 --> 00:26:57,809
I can't find any.

387
00:26:57,847 --> 00:27:00,816
They're all over here,
come on.

388
00:27:02,686 --> 00:27:06,281
Whoa, look at this one!

389
00:27:06,323 --> 00:27:08,985
- He's a find.
- Let me see it.

390
00:27:09,025 --> 00:27:10,458
Hey, you gotta show
that one to Joe.

391
00:27:10,493 --> 00:27:12,484
He's really gonna
puke, huh, Joe?

392
00:27:12,529 --> 00:27:15,089
Yup, he's gonna
spew his guts.

393
00:27:15,131 --> 00:27:17,099
What if he doesn't?

394
00:27:17,133 --> 00:27:19,124
What was that, Adam?

395
00:27:19,169 --> 00:27:20,693
Huh?

396
00:27:20,737 --> 00:27:23,433
Well, um...

397
00:27:23,473 --> 00:27:26,203
worms could just
be like meat really.

398
00:27:26,242 --> 00:27:29,302
You know, think of
the first person who said,

399
00:27:29,346 --> 00:27:31,473
"I'm gonna eat a chicken."

400
00:27:31,514 --> 00:27:34,847
Then he ate it and it
was just a chicken.

401
00:27:34,884 --> 00:27:36,511
Then we have
to find out.

402
00:27:36,553 --> 00:27:38,077
Someone get a worm.

403
00:27:38,121 --> 00:27:40,180
- Come here.
- Me?

404
00:27:49,065 --> 00:27:51,124
Don't spit it out.
Chew it.

405
00:27:51,167 --> 00:27:53,158
Chew, Adam.

406
00:27:53,203 --> 00:27:55,228
My God!

407
00:27:55,271 --> 00:27:56,738
Whoa!

408
00:27:56,773 --> 00:27:58,604
Perfect.

409
00:27:58,641 --> 00:28:02,372
You see, that was one worm.
Wormboy has to eat 10.

410
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,495
Joe has a ring called
the death ring.

411
00:28:20,530 --> 00:28:24,057
If he punches you with it
you die.

412
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:26,068
But you don't die now.

413
00:28:26,102 --> 00:28:29,503
You die in the eighth grade,
so nobody can prove it.

414
00:28:29,539 --> 00:28:32,667
It's got poison in it that goes
into your skin and makes an ulcer.

415
00:28:32,709 --> 00:28:35,439
Very slowly,

416
00:28:35,478 --> 00:28:37,708
you bleed to death.

417
00:28:37,747 --> 00:28:39,681
Death.

418
00:28:45,388 --> 00:28:48,084
I'm running away.

419
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,240
Ow!

420
00:29:48,251 --> 00:29:50,378
I can't run away.

421
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:52,547
Where will I go?

422
00:29:56,893 --> 00:29:58,224
I've got to do it.

423
00:30:05,134 --> 00:30:08,900
If we don't fight the evil forces,
they'll destroy our planet.

424
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,504
Beat the evil forces!

425
00:30:25,088 --> 00:30:26,851
Billy, I need
to talk to you.

426
00:30:28,491 --> 00:30:31,016
Billy, I want you to look
after Woody today, all right?

427
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:33,722
Don't let him get
in any trouble.

428
00:30:33,763 --> 00:30:36,391
- Woody?
- Yeah, Woody.

429
00:30:36,432 --> 00:30:38,491
Make sure he gets lunch, all right?
We'll be back for supper.

430
00:30:38,535 --> 00:30:39,866
No, Dad, no!

431
00:30:39,903 --> 00:30:41,928
Billy, you don't have
a choice in the matter, okay?

432
00:30:41,971 --> 00:30:44,838
I need to be fo...
focused today, okay?

433
00:30:44,874 --> 00:30:47,707
So do I!
I need to be focused.

434
00:30:47,744 --> 00:30:49,507
No, you don't need to be
focused. It's Saturday.

435
00:30:49,546 --> 00:30:52,413
You get to do whatever you want.
Just include your brother.

436
00:30:54,150 --> 00:30:56,414
Okay, listen, Wood,

437
00:30:56,452 --> 00:30:59,080
you're little, okay?

438
00:30:59,122 --> 00:31:02,558
So you don't even
know anything, okay?

439
00:31:02,592 --> 00:31:05,425
So today,
for the whole day

440
00:31:05,461 --> 00:31:08,089
you have to obey me.
You know what that means?

441
00:31:08,131 --> 00:31:09,723
Be your slave?

442
00:31:09,766 --> 00:31:11,631
Well, yeah, kind of.

443
00:31:15,305 --> 00:31:16,897
What are you doing?

444
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:18,498
Trying to drool
on those ants.

445
00:31:20,977 --> 00:31:22,877
Ugh! Listen to me, Wood.

446
00:31:22,912 --> 00:31:25,881
You know how we moved
here and how everything is different?

447
00:31:25,915 --> 00:31:29,146
Like our house
and your school.

448
00:31:29,185 --> 00:31:30,743
Well, it's the same
thing with me.

449
00:31:30,787 --> 00:31:32,254
I'm not the same
brother you had before.

450
00:31:32,288 --> 00:31:34,449
I'm a whole other person.

451
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:36,788
And everything you remember
about your old brother,

452
00:31:36,826 --> 00:31:39,351
all isn't true
about your new brother.

453
00:31:39,395 --> 00:31:41,556
For instance,
I've never been sick.

454
00:31:41,598 --> 00:31:43,691
- I've seen you sick.
- Woody.

455
00:31:43,733 --> 00:31:47,032
You threw up at Raging Waters
and they had to drain the whole pool.

456
00:31:47,070 --> 00:31:49,300
That wasn't me!
Don't you get it?

457
00:31:49,339 --> 00:31:51,307
And don't pick your nose!

458
00:31:51,341 --> 00:31:53,070
What, you're gonna pick
your nose all day?

459
00:31:53,109 --> 00:31:54,736
You're hurting my bike!

460
00:31:54,777 --> 00:31:57,473
I'm not hurting your bike.
I can't hurt a person's bike.

461
00:31:57,513 --> 00:32:00,914
Well, you're shaking it
and it's hitting my dilly-dink.

462
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,474
Don't say stuff like that.

463
00:32:02,518 --> 00:32:04,713
My dilly-dink is my penis.

464
00:32:18,601 --> 00:32:20,296
I'm gonna eat the worms.

465
00:32:20,336 --> 00:32:21,894
Okay.

466
00:32:21,938 --> 00:32:25,066
And, um...

467
00:32:25,108 --> 00:32:26,803
what are you doing today?

468
00:32:26,843 --> 00:32:28,868
Why?

469
00:32:30,513 --> 00:32:32,378
I have to babysit
my little brother.

470
00:32:32,415 --> 00:32:34,849
Where is he?

471
00:32:43,059 --> 00:32:44,492
Get this stuff off me!

472
00:32:50,199 --> 00:32:53,191
- Joey the Joke.
- Give me it, Nigel.

473
00:32:53,236 --> 00:32:56,467
- Heard a story about you today, Joke.
- What story?

474
00:32:56,506 --> 00:32:58,804
- Something about a worm.
- The bet, you mean?

475
00:32:58,841 --> 00:33:01,139
You tell me, Joke.

476
00:33:01,177 --> 00:33:03,042
Well, this new kid
at our school,

477
00:33:03,079 --> 00:33:05,070
I-I'm making
him eat 10 worms and...

478
00:33:05,114 --> 00:33:06,843
Same guy who threw
a worm in your face?

479
00:33:06,883 --> 00:33:09,545
- Who told you that?
- Your dumb friend, Plug.

480
00:33:09,585 --> 00:33:11,712
Plug told you?

481
00:33:11,754 --> 00:33:14,587
Actually he told
his sister and she told me.

482
00:33:14,624 --> 00:33:17,752
Said the whole school
was laughing and that you were afraid.

483
00:33:17,794 --> 00:33:20,558
Were you afraid, Joke,
of a little worm?

484
00:33:20,596 --> 00:33:22,029
I wasn't afraid.

485
00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:25,724
Joke. Joke.

486
00:33:25,768 --> 00:33:27,531
You're a joke.

487
00:33:30,173 --> 00:33:33,040
Get out of here, crows!
Get out of my kitchen!

488
00:33:33,209 --> 00:33:36,508
Look what happens when you put
them on a gummy worm.

489
00:33:42,819 --> 00:33:44,411
Whoa, look at them.

490
00:33:44,454 --> 00:33:46,354
They're having
a spasmodic convulsion.

491
00:33:50,126 --> 00:33:52,219
Hey guys, here comes Joe.

492
00:33:56,632 --> 00:33:59,931
- Plug.
- Yeah.

493
00:33:59,969 --> 00:34:01,937
Come here.

494
00:34:05,608 --> 00:34:08,600
- What did I do?
- Ask your sister.

495
00:34:12,348 --> 00:34:14,111
Benjy, how are you
gonna cook them?

496
00:34:14,150 --> 00:34:16,209
- With this stuff.
- What is it?

497
00:34:16,252 --> 00:34:19,779
- Lard.
- Is that like butter?

498
00:34:19,822 --> 00:34:22,791
Lard's from a pig.
It's the fat.

499
00:34:25,328 --> 00:34:27,660
Pig fat.

500
00:34:29,766 --> 00:34:31,734
Make sure you
tell Wormboy that.

501
00:34:31,768 --> 00:34:34,760
Yeah, look at it.

502
00:34:34,804 --> 00:34:36,738
10 seems like so many.

503
00:34:36,773 --> 00:34:39,105
Why did you make it 10?

504
00:34:39,142 --> 00:34:41,770
Because I said
I could eat 10.

505
00:34:41,811 --> 00:34:44,075
But I didn't mean it.

506
00:34:44,113 --> 00:34:46,638
And Joe said,
"You said..."

507
00:34:46,682 --> 00:34:50,584
I couldn't back out because I did say
it, you know what I mean?

508
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,952
Not really.

509
00:34:55,424 --> 00:34:57,392
Hey, Joe, there he is.

510
00:34:57,426 --> 00:35:00,918
Hey, Wormboy,
that's your team, huh?

511
00:35:00,963 --> 00:35:03,955
You and her,
and who's that little kid?

512
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,467
He's got training wheels.

513
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:10,063
Hey, Wormboy!

514
00:35:10,106 --> 00:35:12,097
Wormboy?

515
00:35:12,141 --> 00:35:15,474
Let me give you another person.
You know, help you out.

516
00:35:15,511 --> 00:35:17,536
Make things fair.
Adam, go.

517
00:35:18,915 --> 00:35:21,611
Wormboy!

518
00:35:32,628 --> 00:35:35,358
You're gonna see
stuff today, Woody,

519
00:35:35,398 --> 00:35:38,094
and it's just normal stuff
that big kids do.

520
00:35:38,134 --> 00:35:39,999
And big kids never
tell their parents.

521
00:35:40,036 --> 00:35:42,869
- Do you understand?
- Billy, I have to go poo.

522
00:35:42,905 --> 00:35:44,896
Oh, Jeez.

523
00:35:44,941 --> 00:35:46,841
I can't help it,
it's making me.

524
00:35:46,876 --> 00:35:49,902
- What is?
- Everything.

525
00:35:49,946 --> 00:35:52,278
Woody, come with me.
Billy, go.

526
00:35:59,355 --> 00:36:00,720
All right, let's go.

527
00:36:11,934 --> 00:36:13,561
Pig fat was not
part of the bet.

528
00:36:13,603 --> 00:36:16,163
You're the one that said
you liked them fried, Wormboy.

529
00:36:16,205 --> 00:36:20,505
"The greasier, the slimier
the better," you said.

530
00:36:22,545 --> 00:36:24,740
Worm number one:

531
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,611
"Le Big Porker."

532
00:36:26,649 --> 00:36:28,549
What are you talking
like that for?

533
00:36:28,584 --> 00:36:30,017
I'm French.

534
00:36:30,052 --> 00:36:32,748
Go on, Wormboy.
Eat it.

535
00:36:36,359 --> 00:36:38,293
Bon appetit.

536
00:36:46,535 --> 00:36:49,333
Yuck, worm juice!

537
00:36:49,372 --> 00:36:51,772
It squirted right on me.

538
00:36:51,807 --> 00:36:54,799
Go on, Wormboy, eat it
before all the guts run out.

539
00:37:10,559 --> 00:37:12,220
He did it.

540
00:37:12,261 --> 00:37:14,855
Oh, gross!

541
00:37:14,897 --> 00:37:17,593
Ugh!

542
00:37:19,335 --> 00:37:21,132
Ew ew ew ew ew ew

543
00:37:21,170 --> 00:37:23,638
ew ew ew ew ew.

544
00:37:26,542 --> 00:37:28,169
I don't like
where I'm sitting.

545
00:37:30,279 --> 00:37:32,338
Look out, you guys!

546
00:37:34,884 --> 00:37:36,977
I think he's
gonna puke already.

547
00:37:41,490 --> 00:37:42,923
Where's the worm?

548
00:37:42,959 --> 00:37:46,224
- Let's see.
- I don't think it's sanitary.

549
00:37:46,262 --> 00:37:48,230
You have to swallow it,
Wormboy, all of it.

550
00:37:48,264 --> 00:37:50,391
There's chunks in there
he hasn't even chewed yet.

551
00:37:50,433 --> 00:37:52,901
Swallow! Swallow!

552
00:37:52,935 --> 00:37:56,098
Swallow! Swallow!
Swallow!

553
00:37:56,138 --> 00:37:59,301
Swallow! Swallow!

554
00:37:59,342 --> 00:38:00,809
Hey kids,

555
00:38:00,843 --> 00:38:04,335
no fires in the park
without adult supervision!

556
00:38:21,330 --> 00:38:24,163
Want to make a wish, Woody?
Here's what you do.

557
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,998
Take a little stone
and go like this,

558
00:38:27,036 --> 00:38:28,560
# I wish I had a horse #

559
00:38:28,604 --> 00:38:31,596
# That I could ride
ride ride. #

560
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,268
Here, now you try.

561
00:38:34,310 --> 00:38:37,973
# I wish my brother
was dead dead dead. #

562
00:38:40,516 --> 00:38:44,475
Swallow! Swallow!
Swallow! Swallow!

563
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,784
Hey, make sure he
doesn't spit it out!

564
00:38:46,822 --> 00:38:49,552
Swallow! Swallow!

565
00:38:49,592 --> 00:38:51,992
Swallow!
Swallow!

566
00:38:52,028 --> 00:38:53,461
Billy!

567
00:38:53,496 --> 00:38:55,828
Ugh!

568
00:38:55,865 --> 00:38:59,028
Swallow! Swallow!
Swallow!

569
00:38:59,068 --> 00:39:01,593
Hey, you guys!

570
00:39:12,415 --> 00:39:15,873
He ate it, Joe, look.

571
00:39:15,918 --> 00:39:17,977
Yeah, I see him Benjy.

572
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:20,818
So what are we gonna do now?
We got no place to cook them.

573
00:39:20,856 --> 00:39:23,882
Come on, you guys,
we need somebody's kitchen.

574
00:39:23,926 --> 00:39:26,417
- My family is vegetarian.
- No way.

575
00:39:26,462 --> 00:39:28,589
Hey, I know, Adam Simms.

576
00:39:28,631 --> 00:39:31,031
His uncle owns
The Brown Toad.

577
00:39:31,067 --> 00:39:33,592
My uncle hates me.

578
00:39:37,473 --> 00:39:38,872
You boys know what you want?

579
00:39:38,908 --> 00:39:40,375
You're taking up the whole
counter there.

580
00:39:40,409 --> 00:39:43,435
- Uh, we're still deciding, sir.
- Yeah.

581
00:40:03,765 --> 00:40:04,891
Adam!

582
00:40:06,668 --> 00:40:09,694
- Oh, hi, Uncle Ed.
- What's this?

583
00:40:09,737 --> 00:40:12,069
I was just, um, giving
you a hand in here.

584
00:40:12,106 --> 00:40:15,542
Last time you gave me a hand you
nearly chopped your thumb off.

585
00:40:17,578 --> 00:40:20,308
Yuck!

586
00:40:20,348 --> 00:40:22,213
Here, just wear this.

587
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:25,310
Don't muck up the works.

588
00:40:26,688 --> 00:40:28,986
Adam! Faster!

589
00:40:29,023 --> 00:40:31,890
Cook faster.

590
00:40:34,095 --> 00:40:35,926
Oh, no.

591
00:40:37,098 --> 00:40:38,326
Ugh!

592
00:40:38,366 --> 00:40:40,891
Hey hey hey! You're gonna burn
down my restaurant!

593
00:40:40,935 --> 00:40:43,836
- But Uncle Ed...
- Stay back! Stay back!

594
00:40:45,306 --> 00:40:47,467
There you go.

595
00:40:47,508 --> 00:40:50,409
Omelet up.
Ding ding.

596
00:41:02,657 --> 00:41:04,352
Boiler Head.

597
00:41:06,995 --> 00:41:08,485
- Come on.
- Let's go.

598
00:41:09,897 --> 00:41:13,492
Hello, boys.

599
00:41:13,534 --> 00:41:15,001
Come on over here.

600
00:41:15,036 --> 00:41:18,164
Come on.

601
00:41:23,811 --> 00:41:27,508
You boys up to something?
You look a little mischievous.

602
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:31,084
Do you know,

603
00:41:31,119 --> 00:41:33,644
that I used to come
to The Brown Toad

604
00:41:33,688 --> 00:41:36,350
when I was a kid?
Yeah.

605
00:41:37,759 --> 00:41:41,286
Oh, root beer float
and a bacon burger...

606
00:41:41,329 --> 00:41:45,129
by golly,
I was in heaven.

607
00:41:45,166 --> 00:41:47,862
Alley-oop.

608
00:41:47,902 --> 00:41:51,531
Mm.

609
00:41:51,572 --> 00:41:55,008
Mm mm mm.

610
00:41:55,043 --> 00:41:58,638
Mm, that's a good omelet.

611
00:41:58,679 --> 00:42:01,113
He ate the whole worm!

612
00:42:01,149 --> 00:42:04,209
The principal
of our school!

613
00:42:04,252 --> 00:42:08,348
"When I was a boy I ate
root beer floats, by golly!"

614
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:11,920
Why did he say
alley-oop?

615
00:42:11,959 --> 00:42:13,392
- Yeah.
- Maybe he's nuts.

616
00:42:13,428 --> 00:42:16,056
Yeah!

617
00:42:16,097 --> 00:42:19,897
I am Boiler Head.
Alley-oop!

618
00:42:19,934 --> 00:42:21,902
Alley-oop, alley-oop,

619
00:42:21,936 --> 00:42:24,871
Alley-oop, alley-oop.

620
00:42:24,906 --> 00:42:27,807
- Donny!
- Alley-oop, alley-oop...

621
00:42:31,112 --> 00:42:32,511
I'm sorry.

622
00:42:32,547 --> 00:42:35,414
We're just laughing, Joe.

623
00:42:36,651 --> 00:42:40,747
I wasn't asking you,
Wormboy.

624
00:42:40,788 --> 00:42:42,779
Adam!

625
00:42:44,992 --> 00:42:47,460
What's this box of bugs
doing in my restaurant?

626
00:42:47,495 --> 00:42:49,690
You're gonna have the health
department on my case.

627
00:42:49,730 --> 00:42:51,960
Get out of here!
All of you!

628
00:42:54,268 --> 00:42:56,862
Punks!

629
00:42:56,904 --> 00:42:59,134
Don't worry, you guys.

630
00:42:59,173 --> 00:43:02,768
I cooked the worm.
I seriously cooked it.

631
00:43:10,251 --> 00:43:14,051
I cooked two worms at once.
See, two of them.

632
00:43:14,088 --> 00:43:17,251
Oh, cool.

633
00:43:17,291 --> 00:43:19,191
How did you
make it so lumpy?

634
00:43:19,227 --> 00:43:21,286
I dunked it in
the French fry fryer

635
00:43:21,329 --> 00:43:23,820
and then smeared liver
juice all over it.

636
00:43:23,865 --> 00:43:25,230
Liver juice?

637
00:43:25,266 --> 00:43:27,734
I was trying
to cover the worm taste.

638
00:43:27,768 --> 00:43:30,236
Hey, you guys,
I should name it.

639
00:43:30,271 --> 00:43:33,832
How about
"The Greasy Brown Toad

640
00:43:33,875 --> 00:43:36,036
Bloater
Special"?

641
00:43:36,077 --> 00:43:38,136
Plug!

642
00:43:38,179 --> 00:43:40,511
What's the matter,
not French enough for you?

643
00:43:40,548 --> 00:43:42,812
All right,
go on, Wormboy.

644
00:43:42,850 --> 00:43:45,080
Eat it.

645
00:43:47,421 --> 00:43:50,151
Ew!

646
00:44:03,604 --> 00:44:05,231
Ugh!

647
00:44:08,309 --> 00:44:11,244
Why are they
guarding him, Adam?

648
00:44:11,345 --> 00:44:13,176
In case he throws up.

649
00:44:13,214 --> 00:44:15,011
'Cause what if he
wanted to cheat?

650
00:44:15,049 --> 00:44:17,040
He could throw up
and never tell.

651
00:44:17,084 --> 00:44:20,053
So Joe made Plug and Bradley
the official puke watchers.

652
00:44:20,087 --> 00:44:23,352
Adam, are you positive
Twitch is okay with this?

653
00:44:23,391 --> 00:44:25,052
Sure.

654
00:44:25,092 --> 00:44:27,287
No! Please!

655
00:44:27,328 --> 00:44:29,023
They're gonna kill...

656
00:44:29,063 --> 00:44:31,190
- Tomato paste.
- And put this cheese in.

657
00:44:31,232 --> 00:44:34,497
Smell it.
It smells like a person's armpit.

658
00:44:34,535 --> 00:44:37,368
You guys! You can't just
steal everything.

659
00:44:37,405 --> 00:44:39,202
- Are we allowed to eat a pickle?
- No.

660
00:44:39,240 --> 00:44:41,640
Your dog is walking
sideways, Twitch.

661
00:44:41,676 --> 00:44:44,201
No no,
she has arthritis.

662
00:44:44,245 --> 00:44:46,406
Oh, my eyes are burning.

663
00:44:46,447 --> 00:44:48,039
- No!
- What all's in there?

664
00:44:48,082 --> 00:44:50,175
Louisiana Hot Sauce sauce.
So hot

665
00:44:50,218 --> 00:44:52,743
it'll blow a
person's head off.

666
00:44:52,787 --> 00:44:54,584
Bam bam bam!

667
00:44:54,622 --> 00:44:56,055
No! No!

668
00:44:57,525 --> 00:44:59,322
It's ready.

669
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,851
The "Burning Fireball."

670
00:45:01,896 --> 00:45:03,488
All right,
I'll go get him.

671
00:45:03,531 --> 00:45:06,261
No!
Ah!

672
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,268
Man.

673
00:45:08,302 --> 00:45:10,827
Hey, guys, bring him in.

674
00:45:10,871 --> 00:45:12,270
No! I'm not ready yet.

675
00:45:12,306 --> 00:45:15,867
I gotta go watch, 'cause
this one's gonna be ugly.

676
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:17,741
Wait for me, you guys!

677
00:45:19,614 --> 00:45:21,912
Erika, watch me!

678
00:45:26,687 --> 00:45:28,552
Boys are so weird.

679
00:45:37,965 --> 00:45:40,593
He can't even stand
the smell.

680
00:45:50,878 --> 00:45:53,574
Hot hot hot hot!
It's burning!

681
00:45:53,614 --> 00:45:56,378
Come on, Wormboy,
eat the whole thing.

682
00:46:02,523 --> 00:46:04,957
Sick.

683
00:46:18,973 --> 00:46:20,998
He's gonna blow!

684
00:46:23,878 --> 00:46:27,370
It's over! It's all over.
Everyone just stand back.

685
00:46:27,415 --> 00:46:29,110
Stand back, you guys.

686
00:46:29,150 --> 00:46:31,277
- Just open your mouth, Wormboy.
- Water!

687
00:46:31,319 --> 00:46:34,720
No water!
It's a new rule.

688
00:46:37,224 --> 00:46:40,421
No more cooking
in my house!

689
00:46:40,461 --> 00:46:43,487
The door is locked!

690
00:46:43,531 --> 00:46:46,830
And... and...

691
00:46:46,867 --> 00:46:48,926
and I quit your team, Joe!

692
00:46:53,441 --> 00:46:55,875
Who cares if you quit?

693
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:58,276
All you are is Twitch,
you little loser.

694
00:47:00,715 --> 00:47:03,479
Anybody else?
Huh?

695
00:47:03,517 --> 00:47:05,246
Want to go
on Wormboy's team?

696
00:47:09,490 --> 00:47:10,980
Yeah!

697
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:14,055
Me.

698
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:17,722
Me too, Joe!

699
00:47:17,765 --> 00:47:20,063
You're already
on his team, Adam.

700
00:47:20,101 --> 00:47:21,864
Yeah, but you made me be.

701
00:47:21,902 --> 00:47:25,269
But now I want to.
That's different

702
00:47:30,244 --> 00:47:32,872
- Here you go, Billy.
- Ahh!

703
00:47:34,615 --> 00:47:36,947
- Turn it off, Adam!
- Turn it off!

704
00:47:38,953 --> 00:47:41,717
- Turn it off!
- I'm trying.

705
00:47:41,756 --> 00:47:43,223
Here, come on.

706
00:47:43,257 --> 00:47:44,884
Look, Benjy, you got
to do better, okay?

707
00:47:44,925 --> 00:47:48,088
- I practically poisoned him.
- Then why didn't it work?

708
00:47:48,129 --> 00:47:51,360
Wormboy stopped himself
with mental powers.

709
00:47:51,399 --> 00:47:55,028
- What?
- His mind told his vomit

710
00:47:55,069 --> 00:47:58,129
to stay inside of his stomach.

711
00:48:00,841 --> 00:48:02,604
That's impossible.

712
00:48:02,643 --> 00:48:05,305
Yeah, puke has
a mind of its own.

713
00:48:07,014 --> 00:48:08,879
You almost took
my head off, Adam.

714
00:48:11,318 --> 00:48:12,842
Here you go.

715
00:48:14,622 --> 00:48:16,055
Don't...

716
00:48:19,593 --> 00:48:21,584
- I'm okay.
- Hy-ah!

717
00:48:21,629 --> 00:48:24,598
- I got it! Oh!
- Hoo-ah!

718
00:48:24,632 --> 00:48:26,930
Oh!

719
00:48:26,967 --> 00:48:29,629
Okay, this...

720
00:48:29,670 --> 00:48:32,195
- this is not going well.
- Where are you going?

721
00:48:32,239 --> 00:48:34,571
- This is... this is bad.
- What?

722
00:48:34,608 --> 00:48:36,132
- We're terrible. We're terrible.
- What?

723
00:48:36,177 --> 00:48:38,611
I got bad shorts.
People are staring at us. This is bad.

724
00:48:38,646 --> 00:48:41,012
Oh, that's him.

725
00:48:41,048 --> 00:48:43,915
Look alive, here they come.
Here they come.

726
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,088
That's the guy
you're afraid of?

727
00:48:50,791 --> 00:48:52,759
Huh.

728
00:48:52,793 --> 00:48:55,489
# I'm not the kind of guy #

729
00:48:55,529 --> 00:49:00,228
# Who gives up
just like that... #

730
00:49:00,267 --> 00:49:02,132
# Oh no oh oh #

731
00:49:02,169 --> 00:49:04,865
- # The tide is high... #
- Yup yup.

732
00:49:04,905 --> 00:49:07,840
# But I'm holding on... #

733
00:49:07,875 --> 00:49:11,470
- Ow!
- Honey!

734
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:14,807
We're a team, right?

735
00:49:14,849 --> 00:49:16,840
- And we're gonna beat Joe Guire.
- Yeah!

736
00:49:16,884 --> 00:49:19,580
And we're gonna make him
come to school with worms in his pants.

737
00:49:19,620 --> 00:49:21,611
- Yeah!
- And when he does...

738
00:49:21,655 --> 00:49:23,555
He's gonna punch us all
with the death ring

739
00:49:23,591 --> 00:49:25,456
and we're all gonna die
like Adam Simms.

740
00:49:29,363 --> 00:49:32,890
Hey, but that's not till
the eighth grade, right?

741
00:49:35,169 --> 00:49:36,796
Where is Adam?

742
00:49:51,852 --> 00:49:55,117
- Adam?
- Oh, oh, oh.

743
00:49:55,155 --> 00:49:57,146
Come on, man, go go!
Keep on going!

744
00:49:57,191 --> 00:49:59,352
- No no no.
- Yeah, keep going!

745
00:49:59,393 --> 00:50:01,588
- Come on!
- Come on!

746
00:50:05,232 --> 00:50:08,167
Let's go!

747
00:50:08,202 --> 00:50:11,660
Whoo!
Get down.

748
00:50:11,705 --> 00:50:14,333
Faster!

749
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:17,367
- Faster!
- Faster! Faster!

750
00:50:19,547 --> 00:50:21,640
Whoo!
Whoo!

751
00:50:24,251 --> 00:50:26,446
- Look out, Billy!
- Billy!

752
00:50:26,487 --> 00:50:28,045
Hey, what's going on
back there?

753
00:50:28,088 --> 00:50:30,215
- Game over!
- Let's get out of here!

754
00:50:30,257 --> 00:50:32,555
- Run run!
- Let's go! Let's go!

755
00:50:32,593 --> 00:50:34,823
Get out!
Get out of my store.

756
00:50:45,439 --> 00:50:47,464
Are you ready?

757
00:50:47,508 --> 00:50:50,944
# One little bird
fell out of the nest #

758
00:50:50,978 --> 00:50:52,843
# When the cat ate him up #

759
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,509
- # His mama said it's for the best. #
- Two bird.

760
00:50:56,550 --> 00:50:59,576
# Two little bird flapped
his wings and flew #

761
00:50:59,620 --> 00:51:02,748
# He met an aeroplane
and said, boom #

762
00:51:02,790 --> 00:51:05,623
- # How do you do? #
- It's Erika.

763
00:51:05,659 --> 00:51:05,759
Hey, you guys!

764
00:51:05,759 --> 00:51:07,351
Hey, you guys!

765
00:51:07,393 --> 00:51:10,556
- It's Erk.
- Stop!

766
00:51:10,597 --> 00:51:12,292
Joe, stop!

767
00:51:12,332 --> 00:51:14,562
You're touching my bike.

768
00:51:14,601 --> 00:51:16,125
Yeah yeah.
Is the bet over?

769
00:51:16,169 --> 00:51:18,535
You're a girl,
you don't know about the bet.

770
00:51:18,571 --> 00:51:21,301
- Where's Billy?
- Erk, let go!

771
00:51:21,341 --> 00:51:24,777
Look, we're going to Plug's house, okay?
His dad's got a blowtorch.

772
00:51:24,811 --> 00:51:26,870
Tell me where Billy is.
We can't keep up with you guys.

773
00:51:26,913 --> 00:51:29,108
Who asked you to?

774
00:51:29,149 --> 00:51:31,117
I'm looking after
Billy's brother.

775
00:51:31,151 --> 00:51:33,915
So that's who that kid is?

776
00:51:33,953 --> 00:51:36,820
He's Wormboy's
little brother?

777
00:51:38,525 --> 00:51:40,550
Don't talk to him, Woody.

778
00:51:40,593 --> 00:51:43,323
Do you wanna know where
Billy is or don't you?

779
00:51:44,364 --> 00:51:47,663
Hey, Woody.

780
00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,725
Have you ever seen
your brother throw up?

781
00:51:49,769 --> 00:51:51,703
He doesn't know what
you're talking about, Joe.

782
00:51:51,738 --> 00:51:53,069
Sure he does.

783
00:51:53,106 --> 00:51:55,836
Yeah, he got sick
from chicken pox,

784
00:51:55,875 --> 00:51:58,105
too much Halloween,

785
00:51:58,144 --> 00:52:00,635
and putting tooth paste
on a light bulb.

786
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:03,080
And he got sick
at the zoo

787
00:52:03,116 --> 00:52:05,949
from watching
a pig lick itself!

788
00:52:07,687 --> 00:52:09,416
What else did
he get sick from?

789
00:52:09,455 --> 00:52:11,286
Car sick.

790
00:52:11,324 --> 00:52:12,985
Oh, yeah?

791
00:52:13,026 --> 00:52:16,621
Mo-wo-wotion sickness.

792
00:52:19,732 --> 00:52:21,757
Thanks, you little midget.

793
00:52:30,710 --> 00:52:33,008
What happened to
the blowtorch, Plug?

794
00:52:33,046 --> 00:52:35,844
My dad just
laughed at me.

795
00:52:35,882 --> 00:52:38,180
Ha ha ha.

796
00:52:38,218 --> 00:52:40,914
Magni-fried.

797
00:52:49,095 --> 00:52:50,494
What's all this?

798
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:54,057
Crushed up marshmallow,
dash of ketchup

799
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:56,125
and tuna fish from a can.

800
00:52:56,169 --> 00:52:57,898
I call it
the "Marsh Mallieu."

801
00:52:57,937 --> 00:53:00,599
How about
"Barf Mallieu"?

802
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:03,871
"Barf-mellow."
Thanks, Adam.

803
00:53:03,910 --> 00:53:06,378
Oops.
Sorry, Billy.

804
00:53:06,412 --> 00:53:08,573
The worm, the sauce.

805
00:53:08,615 --> 00:53:09,843
Oh!

806
00:53:09,883 --> 00:53:12,750
# Alley-oopa,
gentille alley-oopa. #

807
00:53:15,488 --> 00:53:17,149
I can do this.

808
00:53:29,402 --> 00:53:32,929
Whoo!
Oh, yeah, I'm Wormboy!

809
00:53:32,972 --> 00:53:35,873
Stomach of steel!

810
00:53:40,747 --> 00:53:42,510
Ooo!

811
00:53:44,717 --> 00:53:47,811
I ate the whole Barfmel...
whoa! Oh!

812
00:53:48,955 --> 00:53:50,547
Oops.

813
00:53:52,759 --> 00:53:56,126
Are you okay, Billy?

814
00:53:56,162 --> 00:53:59,029
- Billy, are you okay?
- "Billy, are you okay?"

815
00:53:59,065 --> 00:54:01,124
Erk! Erk!

816
00:54:01,167 --> 00:54:03,761
- Billy!
- Billy, are you okay?

817
00:54:03,803 --> 00:54:05,737
- Oh, Billy.
- Poor thing.

818
00:54:05,772 --> 00:54:09,333
Get away, Erika.
You big giant.

819
00:54:09,375 --> 00:54:12,242
Oh!

820
00:54:12,278 --> 00:54:14,906
- Oh, that hurts.
- Erk!

821
00:54:14,948 --> 00:54:16,711
Go on, Erika.

822
00:54:16,749 --> 00:54:18,944
- You big giant!
- Erk!

823
00:54:18,985 --> 00:54:22,921
- Aw! Bye!
- Have a nice day.

824
00:54:22,956 --> 00:54:25,254
Give him another
one, Benjy.

825
00:54:34,267 --> 00:54:37,464
Peanut butter and
worm jam sandwich.

826
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:43,308
Billy the Great.

827
00:54:47,547 --> 00:54:49,037
Woody!

828
00:54:50,550 --> 00:54:52,950
Mommy! Mommy!

829
00:54:52,986 --> 00:54:55,420
- Oh my God! Oh, okay, um...
- Shoot! Chew!

830
00:54:55,455 --> 00:54:57,787
Come here!
Come here, baby!

831
00:54:57,824 --> 00:54:59,314
Chew it!

832
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:02,453
- Billy!
- Swallow.

833
00:55:02,495 --> 00:55:05,191
Hey, there you are.

834
00:55:05,231 --> 00:55:06,596
When are you coming
home for supper?

835
00:55:06,632 --> 00:55:09,795
Supper?

836
00:55:09,836 --> 00:55:11,394
Yeah, supper.

837
00:55:14,407 --> 00:55:16,875
You gonna
introduce me, Billy?

838
00:55:16,909 --> 00:55:18,877
How are you doing, guys?
I'm Billy's father.

839
00:55:18,911 --> 00:55:21,709
- How are you doing, Mr. Forrester?
- Hey!

840
00:55:21,748 --> 00:55:23,841
- Joe Guire.
- Joe Guire, nice to meet you.

841
00:55:23,883 --> 00:55:26,113
You see that, Billy?
Kids do shake hands.

842
00:55:26,152 --> 00:55:28,211
What have you guys been
up to all day, boys?

843
00:55:28,254 --> 00:55:31,314
- Playing, you know.
- Playing, yeah.

844
00:55:31,357 --> 00:55:34,622
- And having fun.
- Yeah.

845
00:55:34,660 --> 00:55:37,026
Great, great.

846
00:55:37,063 --> 00:55:40,590
You know, it's suppertime,
sir, and we all have to go home

847
00:55:40,633 --> 00:55:43,568
and have a nice big supper.
Don't we, Billy?

848
00:55:45,038 --> 00:55:46,938
Right you are, Joe.
Tell you what, Billy,

849
00:55:46,973 --> 00:55:48,907
we're gonna take
the Woodster with us.

850
00:55:48,941 --> 00:55:51,375
He looks a little tired.
And we'll see you at home.

851
00:55:51,411 --> 00:55:54,244
Bye, Mr. Forrester.

852
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:58,216
- What time is it, Bradley?
- 5:03, Joe.

853
00:55:58,251 --> 00:56:02,449
This is perfect. Gotta go home
and gobble down your supper.

854
00:56:02,488 --> 00:56:04,979
Don't even think about puking,

855
00:56:05,024 --> 00:56:07,015
'cause you never know
who's watching.

856
00:56:07,060 --> 00:56:09,187
Bye.

857
00:56:09,228 --> 00:56:13,187
Three whole worms to go.

858
00:56:13,232 --> 00:56:15,223
See, the trick with
chopsticks is

859
00:56:15,268 --> 00:56:17,930
to pinch them like so.

860
00:56:17,970 --> 00:56:19,961
And then it's all
in the wrist.

861
00:56:22,008 --> 00:56:24,306
What's the matter, honey?
Aren't you hungry?

862
00:56:24,343 --> 00:56:26,903
Of course he's hungry.
Out riding bikes around all day.

863
00:56:26,946 --> 00:56:28,345
How many games did
we play today, Helen?

864
00:56:28,381 --> 00:56:30,372
One, but it went
on forever.

865
00:56:30,416 --> 00:56:32,509
- Mommy?
- Yes, sweetie. What is it, honey?

866
00:56:32,552 --> 00:56:34,747
Oh.

867
00:56:34,787 --> 00:56:37,585
- Oh, hey, Wood.
- Poor thing.

868
00:56:37,623 --> 00:56:39,318
- Woody, come on.
- Oh, honey.

869
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:40,757
- I'll give him a bath.
- Okay.

870
00:56:40,793 --> 00:56:43,455
I got you, oh, baby.

871
00:56:43,496 --> 00:56:45,794
Aw, little guy.
He's tuckered out, that little duffer.

872
00:56:45,832 --> 00:56:47,925
Looks like you ran
him ragged, didn't you?

873
00:56:47,967 --> 00:56:50,458
- Dad!
- Yeah.

874
00:56:50,503 --> 00:56:52,664
It's getting late
and they're all going out again.

875
00:56:52,705 --> 00:56:55,902
And... and...

876
00:56:55,942 --> 00:56:57,910
What's going on?

877
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:02,648
I've been eating worms
all day.

878
00:57:02,682 --> 00:57:04,616
What?

879
00:57:04,650 --> 00:57:07,778
Well, I didn't want to, but then when
I started I had to keep going.

880
00:57:07,820 --> 00:57:09,651
And it made me feel awful.

881
00:57:09,689 --> 00:57:12,749
It's okay.
It's okay, Billy, I understand.

882
00:57:12,792 --> 00:57:16,125
I do. I've eaten a few worms
myself this past week.

883
00:57:16,162 --> 00:57:19,256
- You have?
- Yeah.

884
00:57:19,298 --> 00:57:21,459
I'm the new guy too, remember?
Trying to fit in.

885
00:57:21,501 --> 00:57:23,128
Trying to please others.

886
00:57:23,169 --> 00:57:25,637
A worm here and a worm there,
I know what that tastes like.

887
00:57:27,673 --> 00:57:31,336
You're not talking about
real worms, are you, Dad?

888
00:57:31,377 --> 00:57:32,810
I'm talking about adjusting

889
00:57:32,845 --> 00:57:35,370
to a new situation.

890
00:57:35,414 --> 00:57:37,143
You know, I saw
all those boys today.

891
00:57:37,183 --> 00:57:39,583
It's a lot of boys to meet
all at once too, isn't it?

892
00:57:39,619 --> 00:57:42,747
Yeah, well, they're not all
as nice as you think they are.

893
00:57:42,788 --> 00:57:46,246
Careful there, Billy. You don't want
to judge them too quickly.

894
00:57:46,292 --> 00:57:49,989
Take it from me.
You... you want to give people time.

895
00:57:57,570 --> 00:58:00,004
I'm not hungry at all.

896
00:58:00,039 --> 00:58:02,064
Eat up, Billy. You don't want to go
outside on an empty stomach.

897
00:58:07,713 --> 00:58:10,238
Move!

898
00:58:12,585 --> 00:58:14,576
Billy.

899
00:58:16,589 --> 00:58:20,685
What are you guys doing?

900
00:58:20,726 --> 00:58:22,785
Time's running out.

901
00:58:22,828 --> 00:58:25,023
And Joe wants everybody
to meet him down by the river.

902
00:58:25,064 --> 00:58:26,224
Why the river?

903
00:58:26,265 --> 00:58:28,631
There's an old lady
that lives down there.

904
00:58:28,668 --> 00:58:30,329
People say she's a witch.

905
00:58:30,369 --> 00:58:32,860
She sells worms
to fishermen.

906
00:58:32,905 --> 00:58:35,840
Huge ones, long
as a person's arm.

907
00:58:35,875 --> 00:58:37,467
Don't tell him that, Adam.

908
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:40,070
I-I-I meant,
long as a cat's arm.

909
00:58:40,112 --> 00:58:42,239
Where's Twitch?

910
00:58:42,281 --> 00:58:46,081
Grounded 'cause we
wrecked his house,

911
00:58:46,118 --> 00:58:47,881
and destroyed it.

912
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,980
I can't eat anymore
worms, you guys!

913
00:58:51,023 --> 00:58:52,217
I'm gonna quit.

914
00:58:52,258 --> 00:58:54,692
You can't quit.

915
00:58:54,727 --> 00:58:58,390
If you quit then you lose.
Then we all lose.

916
00:58:58,431 --> 00:59:01,025
This is our one chance
not to be losers!

917
00:59:10,376 --> 00:59:12,435
- Woody!
- # When the cat ate him up #

918
00:59:12,478 --> 00:59:15,072
# His mama said
it's for the best. #

919
00:59:15,114 --> 00:59:17,446
- Where did you learn that song?
- Erika.

920
00:59:17,483 --> 00:59:20,816
Erika.

921
00:59:20,853 --> 00:59:23,686
She'll know how to get me
out of this stupid dumb bet.

922
00:59:23,723 --> 00:59:25,486
What are you thinking
of her for?

923
00:59:25,524 --> 00:59:27,685
She's a girl!

924
00:59:27,727 --> 00:59:30,389
And, Billy, you called her
a big fat giant, remember?

925
00:59:33,132 --> 00:59:36,124
- I didn't say fat.
- Yeah, but still.

926
00:59:36,168 --> 00:59:38,568
Erika would never
be mad at me.

927
00:59:38,604 --> 00:59:40,071
We're friends.

928
00:59:40,106 --> 00:59:42,939
- Rat!
- No wait, you don't get it.

929
00:59:42,975 --> 00:59:45,739
Don't get what? That you're just turning
into another Joe?

930
00:59:45,778 --> 00:59:48,713
- I'm not a Joe.
- You were being mean like him.

931
00:59:48,748 --> 00:59:50,773
And you're acting like some
person that you're not.

932
00:59:50,816 --> 00:59:54,308
I'm sorry.
I wasn't being mean on purpose.

933
00:59:54,353 --> 00:59:57,914
You try eating worms with marshmallows
and ketchup on them.

934
00:59:57,957 --> 01:00:01,358
Joe Guire is cruel to people, Billy,
and it's all 'cause people let him.

935
01:00:01,394 --> 01:00:03,954
They just do what he says
and he goes around making rules up.

936
01:00:03,996 --> 01:00:06,260
And you're the first person
that ever did anything.

937
01:00:06,299 --> 01:00:08,767
- What did I do?
- You challenged him!

938
01:00:08,801 --> 01:00:11,998
- Well, I wish I never did.
- And so will he when this is over.

939
01:00:12,038 --> 01:00:13,630
Joe Guire is a bully.

940
01:00:13,673 --> 01:00:15,538
Make him come to school
with worms in his pants

941
01:00:15,574 --> 01:00:17,508
and no one will ever
be scared of him again.

942
01:00:17,543 --> 01:00:19,477
What about
the death ring though?

943
01:00:19,512 --> 01:00:22,811
It's just a dumb old ring he
wears to scare people, Billy.

944
01:00:22,848 --> 01:00:25,009
Win this bet and that
ring will mean nothing.

945
01:00:36,629 --> 01:00:38,290
I've never been
in there before.

946
01:00:38,331 --> 01:00:40,993
- Have you, Joe?
- No.

947
01:00:41,033 --> 01:00:43,058
But my brother went
in there once,

948
01:00:43,102 --> 01:00:45,536
he just saw
fishing stuff.

949
01:00:45,571 --> 01:00:47,869
It was really gross
and spooky inside.

950
01:00:47,907 --> 01:00:50,535
You think Wormboy
is gonna show?

951
01:00:50,576 --> 01:00:53,739
If he doesn't...
I win the bet.

952
01:00:53,779 --> 01:00:56,213
There she is.

953
01:00:57,483 --> 01:01:00,418
Some people call her
the two-headed witch.

954
01:01:00,453 --> 01:01:01,977
You know why?

955
01:01:02,021 --> 01:01:04,182
She had two heads once,

956
01:01:04,223 --> 01:01:07,488
but one fell off.

957
01:01:07,526 --> 01:01:09,551
The one that fell off
is in that bag

958
01:01:09,595 --> 01:01:11,620
she carries around
all the time.

959
01:01:15,201 --> 01:01:18,466
Donny, what's that noise?

960
01:01:18,504 --> 01:01:20,028
It's Benjy.

961
01:01:20,072 --> 01:01:21,539
Benjy!

962
01:01:25,177 --> 01:01:26,838
Benjy!

963
01:01:28,114 --> 01:01:30,548
Ssh!

964
01:01:35,221 --> 01:01:37,280
She's not very
friendly looking.

965
01:01:39,425 --> 01:01:42,861
I wonder what her
other head looks like.

966
01:01:47,433 --> 01:01:50,527
Ssh.

967
01:02:04,850 --> 01:02:06,613
"Gone to catch me
some supper."

968
01:02:06,652 --> 01:02:08,813
Plug, try the door.

969
01:02:08,854 --> 01:02:10,185
Why me?

970
01:02:10,222 --> 01:02:11,587
Just do it, okay?

971
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:30,570
Oh, it's stinky!

972
01:02:32,011 --> 01:02:34,070
Oh, gross.

973
01:02:34,113 --> 01:02:36,081
Interesting.

974
01:02:36,115 --> 01:02:37,946
They've got
dead fish corpses

975
01:02:37,983 --> 01:02:40,451
hanging from
the ceiling.

976
01:02:40,486 --> 01:02:42,613
What do you mean,
dead fish corpses?

977
01:02:48,627 --> 01:02:49,924
That's not funny!

978
01:02:51,831 --> 01:02:53,423
What are you
laughing at, Bradley?

979
01:02:53,466 --> 01:02:56,162
Nothing. It's just
that you seemed kind of...

980
01:02:56,202 --> 01:02:58,102
Scared!

981
01:03:09,181 --> 01:03:11,376
Yeah.

982
01:03:12,885 --> 01:03:15,820
Yeah, I'm just scared
for you, Wormboy, that's all.

983
01:03:15,855 --> 01:03:19,985
'Cause there's big giant
night crawlers in there.

984
01:03:20,025 --> 01:03:22,289
From Canada,
my brother said.

985
01:03:22,328 --> 01:03:24,956
Which means
they're gigantic.

986
01:03:24,997 --> 01:03:28,489
We better get started then.
What time is it, Bradley?

987
01:03:30,202 --> 01:03:32,830
You don't ask Bradley what time it is.
He's on my team.

988
01:03:32,872 --> 01:03:35,807
Whatever you say, Joe.
You make the rules.

989
01:03:35,841 --> 01:03:38,139
- 6:35, Joe.
- Yeah, okay.

990
01:03:39,578 --> 01:03:41,205
Hey you guys,
guess what I found?

991
01:03:41,247 --> 01:03:43,408
Green ones!

992
01:03:45,451 --> 01:03:46,884
Who's got $2?

993
01:03:48,787 --> 01:03:52,587
How about that for technology?
It's like buying a Coke.

994
01:03:53,759 --> 01:03:56,887
Wait, what are
these cups for?

995
01:04:02,134 --> 01:04:04,500
- Plug?
- Yeah.

996
01:04:04,537 --> 01:04:06,596
If Joe loses the bet,

997
01:04:06,639 --> 01:04:09,608
you think he'll really
walk through our school

998
01:04:09,642 --> 01:04:11,837
with worms in his pants?

999
01:04:11,877 --> 01:04:14,675
We can't let him
lose the bet.

1000
01:04:14,713 --> 01:04:17,307
We're on his team.

1001
01:04:17,349 --> 01:04:19,078
Yeah.

1002
01:04:19,118 --> 01:04:22,349
But sometimes I wish
I wasn't on his team.

1003
01:04:22,388 --> 01:04:25,084
Like back at The Brown Toad,
when he yelled at me,

1004
01:04:25,124 --> 01:04:27,217
I wanted to quit his team!

1005
01:04:29,728 --> 01:04:32,196
Then why didn't you?

1006
01:04:34,567 --> 01:04:37,092
I'm not brave,
I guess.

1007
01:04:38,137 --> 01:04:41,470
Ugh, they really
are green.

1008
01:04:41,507 --> 01:04:43,065
Green goes with green.

1009
01:04:43,108 --> 01:04:47,408
Spinach from a can,
crown of broccoli.

1010
01:04:47,446 --> 01:04:50,813
"Viola!"

1011
01:04:53,819 --> 01:04:56,185
You got a worm, Bradley?

1012
01:04:56,221 --> 01:04:59,622
It just went
to the bathroom on my hand.

1013
01:04:59,658 --> 01:05:02,627
Ugh.

1014
01:05:16,876 --> 01:05:20,277
The "Green Slusher" served
in a bed of slush

1015
01:05:20,313 --> 01:05:22,804
at room temperature.

1016
01:05:22,849 --> 01:05:24,612
Bring it on.

1017
01:05:25,751 --> 01:05:28,083
Ugh!

1018
01:05:37,363 --> 01:05:38,762
You made it
too thick, Benjy.

1019
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:46,263
Looks like wasabi.

1020
01:05:52,712 --> 01:05:54,839
Canadian night crawlers.

1021
01:05:56,249 --> 01:05:59,650
There's something
I've always wanted to try.

1022
01:06:05,258 --> 01:06:07,283
I'm naming this one

1023
01:06:07,326 --> 01:06:10,159
"Radioactive Slime Delight."

1024
01:06:16,502 --> 01:06:19,471
I wonder what
he's thinking about.

1025
01:06:27,513 --> 01:06:29,913
Perfect.

1026
01:06:32,985 --> 01:06:35,249
There you go,
Wormboy.

1027
01:06:40,059 --> 01:06:42,584
You might need this.

1028
01:06:45,131 --> 01:06:47,258
Who's that trespassing
in my bait shop?

1029
01:06:49,435 --> 01:06:52,302
- I'm getting out of here.
- Watch out!

1030
01:06:54,473 --> 01:06:56,304
- Come on, let's go. What are you doing?
- A bet's a bet!

1031
01:06:56,342 --> 01:06:57,673
What?

1032
01:06:57,710 --> 01:07:00,543
What are you doing in here?
Get out of here!

1033
01:07:00,580 --> 01:07:02,946
Get out of here.
Get out of here.

1034
01:07:04,450 --> 01:07:06,816
Get out of the way
of the head!

1035
01:07:16,662 --> 01:07:18,823
I think she went inside.

1036
01:07:18,864 --> 01:07:20,354
Are you sure?

1037
01:07:20,399 --> 01:07:22,367
I don't know.

1038
01:07:22,401 --> 01:07:24,392
Let's go.

1039
01:07:36,415 --> 01:07:38,178
Come on, let's get out of here!
Let's go!

1040
01:07:38,217 --> 01:07:39,980
Wait! Wait, you guys!

1041
01:07:42,221 --> 01:07:44,155
Hey you guys, wait!

1042
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:45,919
Wait up!

1043
01:07:45,958 --> 01:07:49,860
Wait up! Wait up!

1044
01:07:49,895 --> 01:07:51,863
Wait for me.

1045
01:07:55,401 --> 01:07:57,995
She was right there.
Right there!

1046
01:07:59,138 --> 01:08:03,097
She hit me in the head...
with her head.

1047
01:08:04,810 --> 01:08:06,641
You didn't throw up,
did you?

1048
01:08:09,548 --> 01:08:11,345
What are you
doing here, Twitch?

1049
01:08:11,384 --> 01:08:13,716
I'm on your team, Billy.

1050
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:22,850
One worm to go.

1051
01:08:39,578 --> 01:08:41,136
What time is it, Bradley?

1052
01:08:41,180 --> 01:08:44,638
- 6:52, Joe.
- What's going on?

1053
01:08:44,684 --> 01:08:46,549
They're digging
for worms, Joe.

1054
01:08:46,585 --> 01:08:49,145
Yeah, but they won't
find any here anyway.

1055
01:08:49,188 --> 01:08:50,985
We will too!

1056
01:08:51,023 --> 01:08:54,459
Time's running
out, Wormboy.

1057
01:08:54,493 --> 01:08:57,121
- Two minutes, Joe.
- We'll never make it.

1058
01:08:57,163 --> 01:08:59,654
There aren't any worms
around here anywhere.

1059
01:08:59,699 --> 01:09:01,963
- There's got to be!
- There's not, Billy!

1060
01:09:02,001 --> 01:09:03,969
We're gonna lose.

1061
01:09:04,003 --> 01:09:06,699
We'll never find a worm.
We might as well just...

1062
01:09:11,777 --> 01:09:13,904
- A worm!
- Eat it, Billy! Come on, eat it!

1063
01:09:13,946 --> 01:09:15,743
Make Joe come to school
with worms in his pants!

1064
01:09:15,781 --> 01:09:18,215
- No!
- Move!

1065
01:09:20,086 --> 01:09:21,883
No!

1066
01:09:41,307 --> 01:09:44,333
That's not fair.

1067
01:09:44,377 --> 01:09:46,675
You're a cheater.

1068
01:09:53,052 --> 01:09:54,576
Go, Billy!

1069
01:09:54,620 --> 01:09:56,554
Go Billy! Go!

1070
01:09:56,589 --> 01:09:58,716
39 seconds.

1071
01:09:58,758 --> 01:10:00,350
Go go go go!

1072
01:10:00,393 --> 01:10:02,861
Get it!
Get it!

1073
01:10:30,556 --> 01:10:31,853
Yeah!

1074
01:10:31,891 --> 01:10:34,758
Billy! Billy!

1075
01:10:34,794 --> 01:10:36,785
Billy!
Billy!

1076
01:10:36,829 --> 01:10:40,026
Billy! Billy!
Billy!

1077
01:10:40,065 --> 01:10:42,192
10 seconds!

1078
01:10:42,234 --> 01:10:45,260
Nine, eight...

1079
01:10:46,672 --> 01:10:49,300
seven...

1080
01:10:49,341 --> 01:10:51,172
six...

1081
01:10:51,210 --> 01:10:53,735
five...

1082
01:10:53,779 --> 01:10:56,441
four...

1083
01:10:56,482 --> 01:10:58,575
three...

1084
01:10:58,617 --> 01:11:00,380
two...

1085
01:11:14,300 --> 01:11:16,359
Boys are so weird!

1086
01:11:21,807 --> 01:11:25,334
Hey, Joke.

1087
01:11:25,377 --> 01:11:29,006
Now you really are a joke.

1088
01:11:29,048 --> 01:11:31,676
Wha... what are you
doing here, Nige?

1089
01:11:31,717 --> 01:11:34,117
I came all the way
here to see you win.

1090
01:11:34,153 --> 01:11:37,145
Now the whole school's
gonna be laughing at you.

1091
01:11:37,189 --> 01:11:39,657
They're gonna be laughing at me
too 'cause I'm your brother.

1092
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:43,118
Leave him alone.

1093
01:11:46,599 --> 01:11:48,464
I think you might want
to stay out of this.

1094
01:11:53,405 --> 01:11:57,102
Leave him alone.

1095
01:11:59,512 --> 01:12:01,241
Yeah,

1096
01:12:01,280 --> 01:12:03,180
leave him alone.

1097
01:12:16,662 --> 01:12:19,995
Bunch of little worms.

1098
01:12:53,232 --> 01:12:54,756
You won.

1099
01:12:58,871 --> 01:13:00,202
Shake on it.

1100
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:03,072
Kids don't shake hands.

1101
01:13:03,108 --> 01:13:05,770
Shake.

1102
01:14:12,410 --> 01:14:15,504
Two sock...
yes, got it.

1103
01:14:15,547 --> 01:14:17,105
Got it.

1104
01:14:17,148 --> 01:14:20,606
- Week number two, Billy.
- Yeah.

1105
01:14:20,652 --> 01:14:23,018
Last Monday seems
like a long time ago.

1106
01:14:34,065 --> 01:14:37,523
What's the headline?

1107
01:14:37,569 --> 01:14:39,696
Cheating.

1108
01:14:39,737 --> 01:14:42,763
- Cheating?
- Yeah.

1109
01:14:42,807 --> 01:14:45,367
If you cheat at something
and you win,

1110
01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:48,709
and nobody knows you
cheated, do you still win?

1111
01:14:48,746 --> 01:14:51,214
The only way to win
is by playing fair.

1112
01:14:51,249 --> 01:14:55,151
But what if you didn't
even know you cheated.

1113
01:14:55,186 --> 01:14:56,949
Then would it be okay?

1114
01:15:01,326 --> 01:15:04,090
Sounds to me like you
already know the answer, Billy.

1115
01:15:19,644 --> 01:15:21,236
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, Billy.

1116
01:15:21,279 --> 01:15:23,247
Bye, Wormboy.

1117
01:15:26,651 --> 01:15:29,484
See you later, Wood.

1118
01:15:31,389 --> 01:15:34,449
- I didn't win.
- Yeah, you did, Billy.

1119
01:15:34,559 --> 01:15:36,356
You ate all 10 worms.

1120
01:15:36,394 --> 01:15:39,158
I only ate nine.

1121
01:15:39,197 --> 01:15:41,392
Then how come we counted 10?

1122
01:15:41,432 --> 01:15:44,458
The 10th one
was eaten by Boiler Head.

1123
01:15:45,737 --> 01:15:48,399
The omelet.

1124
01:15:48,439 --> 01:15:50,304
What are we gonna do?

1125
01:16:05,757 --> 01:16:07,850
Oh!

1126
01:16:13,565 --> 01:16:15,499
Hey, there's Joe!

1127
01:16:18,937 --> 01:16:20,962
Oh, there he is!

1128
01:16:22,106 --> 01:16:24,438
Look, it's Billy!

1129
01:16:33,384 --> 01:16:35,375
What's he doing?

1130
01:16:38,856 --> 01:16:42,519
Ew!

1131
01:16:45,997 --> 01:16:49,489
No way!

1132
01:16:49,534 --> 01:16:51,263
# Get down, get down #

1133
01:16:51,302 --> 01:16:53,930
# Get down,
get down #

1134
01:16:53,972 --> 01:16:56,202
# Get down, get down #

1135
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:58,640
# Get down,
get down #

1136
01:16:58,676 --> 01:17:00,837
- # Jungle boogie... #
- Come on.

1137
01:17:00,878 --> 01:17:03,142
# Jungle boogie,
get it on #

1138
01:17:03,181 --> 01:17:05,513
# Jungle boogie,
down with the boogie #

1139
01:17:05,550 --> 01:17:07,677
# Jungle boogie,
get it on #

1140
01:17:07,719 --> 01:17:10,153
# Jungle boogie,
get up with the boogie #

1141
01:17:10,188 --> 01:17:12,418
# Jungle boogie,
get up with the get down #

1142
01:17:12,457 --> 01:17:14,425
# Jungle boogie,
down with the boogie #

1143
01:17:14,459 --> 01:17:16,689
# Jungle boogie,
shake it around... #

1144
01:17:25,303 --> 01:17:27,703
# Jungle Boogie. #

1145
01:17:31,109 --> 01:17:32,371
What's going on out here?

1146
01:17:32,410 --> 01:17:36,005
Good morning, Mr. Boiler...

1147
01:17:36,047 --> 01:17:38,675
I mean, good afternoon,
Mr. Burdock.

1148
01:17:38,716 --> 01:17:41,014
Good afternoon,
Mr. Burdock.

1149
01:17:44,489 --> 01:17:46,889
Adam Simms...

1150
01:17:46,924 --> 01:17:49,392
Adam!

1151
01:17:54,232 --> 01:17:56,063
Behave yourselves.

1152
01:17:56,100 --> 01:17:58,500
Yes, sir, we're
just walking along.

1153
01:17:58,536 --> 01:18:01,232
Yup, just walking along.

1154
01:18:33,571 --> 01:18:35,300
# Do... do... do...
don't stop the beat #

1155
01:18:35,339 --> 01:18:37,273
# Ca... ca... ca... can't,
control the feet #

1156
01:18:37,308 --> 01:18:39,401
# Pe... pe... pe...
people in the streets #

1157
01:18:39,444 --> 01:18:41,275
# Come on, everybody,
and move your feet #

1158
01:18:41,312 --> 01:18:44,008
# And go #

1159
01:18:44,048 --> 01:18:48,747
# Everybody, move your feet
and feel united #

1160
01:18:48,786 --> 01:18:50,617
# Oh oh oh #

1161
01:18:52,256 --> 01:18:56,659
# Everybody, move your feet
and feel united #

1162
01:18:56,694 --> 01:18:58,855
# Oh oh oh #

1163
01:19:01,632 --> 01:19:03,725
# Yeah #

01:19:03,768 --> 01:19:06,430
# We're going downtown,
oh yeah #

1165
01:19:08,039 --> 01:19:10,473
# We're going downtown,
oh yeah #

1166
01:19:12,143 --> 01:19:13,838
# We're going downtown,
oh yeah... #

1167
01:19:13,878 --> 01:19:15,778
# Sing sing sing

01:19:15,813 --> 01:19:17,747
# And you you you

# Just put put put

1170
01:19:19,484 --> 01:19:21,952
# And all of your troubles
are dead and gone, don't stop #

1171
01:19:21,986 --> 01:19:24,250
- # Don't stop #
- # Don't stop the beat, I can't stop #

1172
01:19:24,288 --> 01:19:26,313
- # Can't stop #
- # Can't stop the beat, I won't stop #

1173
01:19:26,357 --> 01:19:28,757
- # Won't stop #
- # Won't stop the beat, and go #

1174
01:19:41,438 --> 01:19:44,532
# Fat and juicy,
chew them up #

1175
01:19:44,574 --> 01:19:48,442
# Yum yum yum #
