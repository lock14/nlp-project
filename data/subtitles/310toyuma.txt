00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:05,161
[Raspy Breathing]

4
00:01:33,735 --> 00:01:35,524
Dad...

5
00:01:39,303 --> 00:01:41,759
Maybe it's the wind

6
00:01:50,503 --> 00:01:52,096
No!

7
00:01:54,855 --> 00:01:58,597
Stop! Please! Stop!

8
00:02:04,263 --> 00:02:08,125
You have a week, Evans. Then we'll burn the house.

9
00:02:10,536 --> 00:02:12,510
William

10
00:02:23,207 --> 00:02:25,095
William!

11
00:02:32,103 --> 00:02:34,591
God damn it, William!

12
00:02:36,424 --> 00:02:39,806
God damn it! Put that down!

13
00:02:40,295 --> 00:02:41,790
Let go!

14
00:02:45,447 --> 00:02:47,553
It's the last feed we've got

15
00:03:05,287 --> 00:03:07,491
I'll take care of this

16
00:03:11,015 --> 00:03:12,838
No, you won't

17
00:03:42,727 --> 00:03:47,517
Herd's over the ridge by now.
You go get cleaned up.

18
00:03:57,223 --> 00:03:59,612
You lied to me, Dan

19
00:04:01,735 --> 00:04:04,288
You told me we made payments to Hollander.
- We did

20
00:04:04,328 --> 00:04:12,195
So, how do you think we bought feed, Alice.
Three months water, the medicine for Mark...

21
00:04:12,903 --> 00:04:16,165
I had a choice between our family and paying them down

22
00:04:16,551 --> 00:04:18,853
We're supposed to make decisions together

23
00:04:19,207 --> 00:04:21,247
Would you have made anything different?

24
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:31,110
Alice, we can't make it rain together
Turn the dust into grass

25
00:04:31,495 --> 00:04:35,073
We can't stop Hollander from selling
our land to the railroad either

26
00:04:38,151 --> 00:04:45,440
It's too bad the doctors at the aid station didn't take much of my leg.
I read that the pension act pays by the pound now

27
00:04:47,751 --> 00:04:50,140
Stop looking at me like that

28
00:04:50,183 --> 00:04:52,452
Are you going to tell the Marshal what those men did?

29
00:04:52,488 --> 00:04:55,335
Marshal ain't doing shit
-William.

30
00:04:55,368 --> 00:05:01,063
First thing, Mark. I'm going to take you boys.
We're going to round up the herd.
Then I'm going into town

31
00:05:01,095 --> 00:05:02,502
What are you going to do there?

32
00:05:02,535 --> 00:05:04,837
I'm going to tell Hollander to make this right

33
00:05:05,447 --> 00:05:09,375
I'm going to tell him to pay for a new barn.

34
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:13,086
Maybe we should just shoot him like Will says.

35
00:05:39,587 --> 00:05:43,067
Coach is headed for Bigsby, Boss

36
00:05:43,619 --> 00:05:49,085
Girded with iron, (?) on top, double shotguns.
And a Gatling

37
00:06:34,692 --> 00:06:38,139
You should have let me save the feed

38
00:06:42,251 --> 00:06:44,106
Ar you going to hock that?

39
00:06:44,587 --> 00:06:46,496
Some day, William, ...

40
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:50,018
... when you walk in my shoes you might understand.

41
00:06:50,059 --> 00:06:52,645
I ain't never walking in your shoes.

42
00:06:52,716 --> 00:06:54,439
Tracks over here.

43
00:08:05,515 --> 00:08:07,620
Here we go.

44
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:10,048
Giddy up!!

45
00:09:15,339 --> 00:09:17,281
Go man the Gatling

46
00:09:33,323 --> 00:09:35,625
Mark, stay here

47
00:09:53,995 --> 00:09:55,522
Down !!

48
00:10:15,979 --> 00:10:18,532
I think they will not follow us anymore.
[They're not going to (?) in a (?)]

49
00:10:29,515 --> 00:10:31,970
Pull up! Pull up!

50
00:11:24,971 --> 00:11:27,654
Good morning, Pinkerton

51
00:11:28,651 --> 00:11:32,774
Name's Charlie Prince,
I expect you've heard of me.

52
00:11:35,179 --> 00:11:40,776
Well, I heard about a
balled up whore named Charlie Princess.

53
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:43,940
Is that you, missy?

54
00:11:48,427 --> 00:11:50,882
I hate Pinkertons

55
00:11:50,923 --> 00:11:53,028
Byron McElroy

56
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:56,416
When did your hair turn gray, Byron?

57
00:11:57,067 --> 00:11:59,587
Go to hell, Ben Wade.

58
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:07,170
Well, will you look at all this.
You all spared no expense this time, Byron

59
00:12:08,010 --> 00:12:13,280
I've got to say, thought.
It's probably cheaper just to let me rob the damn thing

60
00:12:17,419 --> 00:12:21,729
If you are going to kill me,
just as soon get to it

61
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:25,672
I ain't going to kill you

62
00:12:25,707 --> 00:12:27,714
Not like this

63
00:12:29,355 --> 00:12:32,257
It won't change a thing,
if you let me live

64
00:12:33,867 --> 00:12:36,453
I'll come for you.

65
00:12:37,035 --> 00:12:39,456
I'd be disappointed if you didn't

66
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:42,404
She's lit
She's lit!

67
00:13:30,155 --> 00:13:31,879
Let's go.

68
00:13:48,683 --> 00:13:50,406
There we go

69
00:13:55,595 --> 00:14:02,086
I'm going to ask you to put down the money.
Step back. Tell them to step back or this man will die!

70
00:14:02,123 --> 00:14:04,457
Not a smart move, friend

71
00:14:13,259 --> 00:14:14,885
Shit

72
00:14:19,979 --> 00:14:21,954
He's fast

73
00:14:31,531 --> 00:14:38,339
Well, Tommy. It seems that there was
a Pinkerton inside that coach that wasn't quite dead

74
00:14:40,107 --> 00:14:47,046
Now, I know what Charlie told you,
because we don't got but a few rules in this outfit

75
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:50,149
This is what happens when you put us all at risk

76
00:14:55,531 --> 00:15:01,990
Mark, look at me. Keep looking at me.
Back up quietly

77
00:15:04,298 --> 00:15:05,924
William, look at me.

78
00:15:26,667 --> 00:15:28,707
Good morning.

79
00:15:30,987 --> 00:15:34,729
Those are my cattle.
I want them back.

80
00:15:37,034 --> 00:15:40,809
Carefully rancher. That's Ben Wades
you're talking to

81
00:15:44,427 --> 00:15:46,761
I need them back.

82
00:15:47,211 --> 00:15:49,120
They are all that I've got

83
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:55,174
I don't need your cattle,
but I will be needing them horses

84
00:15:56,138 --> 00:16:00,099
So you don't go doing nohing..., Foolish

85
00:16:20,939 --> 00:16:22,794
Take the horse.

86
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:34,025
Find them on the road to Bigsby.
Boys!

87
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:50,306
They're probably just running late, Mr. Butterfield

88
00:16:50,346 --> 00:16:55,878
Pinkertons don't run late.
That's why they're paid 18 dollars a day.

89
00:17:55,755 --> 00:17:57,478
Get me on my feet.

90
00:17:57,546 --> 00:18:01,092
-I think you're in pretty bad shape, Mr....
-Just get me on my damned feet.

91
00:18:11,914 --> 00:18:15,427
Mark, Williams, get me some of them boards

92
00:18:37,738 --> 00:18:39,527
Can I help you ?

93
00:18:40,298 --> 00:18:45,349
I think maybe a coach headed for here
got itself held up in a canyon about 10 miles back

94
00:18:45,387 --> 00:18:46,914
God damn it

95
00:18:47,338 --> 00:18:49,608
By Mr Ben Wade himself

96
00:18:49,642 --> 00:18:51,300
How did you know it was Wade?

97
00:18:51,339 --> 00:18:53,444
It's been him the last 21 times, Marshal

98
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:55,904
I saw a Mexican sharpshooter and an Apache

99
00:18:55,947 --> 00:18:57,376
God Damn it

100
00:18:58,155 --> 00:19:00,489
-Did you see the hand of God ?
-What's that?

101
00:19:00,554 --> 00:19:03,620
-His pistol
-Why the hell didn't you do something?

102
00:19:04,427 --> 00:19:09,609
They had a lot of weapons, Mr..
And they were shooting bullets.

103
00:19:09,643 --> 00:19:11,530
Let's go, we're wasting time

104
00:19:23,435 --> 00:19:25,736
Where are you from anyway?

105
00:19:29,674 --> 00:19:34,409
Tom Conrad bought 1000 heads in Mexico,
hired us to drive them in

106
00:19:36,107 --> 00:19:38,408
Let's go
Com on, boys.

107
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:54,441
Hmmm. Something is going on with the railroad man

108
00:20:43,882 --> 00:20:48,192
Madame, some whisky for my friends.

109
00:20:51,082 --> 00:20:54,181
Let's go , the bar is closed.

110
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:20,482
Here's to the 4 that we lost in battle.

111
00:21:21,834 --> 00:21:27,879
And here's to the boss who had to say good-bye to
Tommy Darlen today

112
00:21:28,843 --> 00:21:30,817
And that's too bad.

113
00:21:30,859 --> 00:21:33,095
Proverbs 13:3

114
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:41,350
"He that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life.
He that opens his lips too wide, shall bring about his own destruction"

115
00:21:41,419 --> 00:21:43,109
Amen

116
00:21:43,146 --> 00:21:45,993
Tommy was weak
Tommy was stupid.

117
00:21:46,026 --> 00:21:47,935
Tommy is dead

118
00:21:50,346 --> 00:21:52,168
I'll drink to that

119
00:21:57,214 --> 00:21:59,483
Sutherland

120
00:22:00,286 --> 00:22:02,326
Jorgensen.

121
00:22:06,079 --> 00:22:07,388
Campos.

122
00:22:10,386 --> 00:22:12,328
Jackson.

123
00:22:13,682 --> 00:22:15,592
Kinter.

124
00:22:32,466 --> 00:22:36,394
Marshal is only half stupid. 
He's going to be back soon

125
00:22:39,315 --> 00:22:43,592
They're going across the border.
I won't be far.

126
00:22:44,946 --> 00:22:47,150
I'll wait for you.

127
00:22:47,186 --> 00:22:49,390
Allright Charlie.

128
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:04,265
I've seen you someplace before

129
00:23:05,522 --> 00:23:06,799
Have you?

130
00:23:10,706 --> 00:23:14,001
You ever worked for a blind irishman in Leadville?

131
00:23:16,274 --> 00:23:21,871
I was a singer.
The best time I ever had in my whole life

132
00:23:24,946 --> 00:23:26,734
What made you to quit?

133
00:23:28,082 --> 00:23:33,068
I got to coughing
Doctor said I should find a dry climate

134
00:23:37,426 --> 00:23:40,939
You know, I spent more money
in that joint that I could tell you

135
00:23:42,610 --> 00:23:47,596
Do you remember a girl?
Her name was Velvet.

136
00:23:49,618 --> 00:23:52,934
Nobody forgets Velvet

137
00:23:58,930 --> 00:24:01,647
You look kind of skinny.

138
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:08,425
I feel skinny.

139
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,952
It's allright.

140
00:24:13,330 --> 00:24:19,560
I don't mind skinny girls
As long as they've got green eyes to make up for it

141
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:23,978
Have you got green eyes?

142
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:39,338
That's right, they (?) to be green.

143
00:24:48,658 --> 00:24:53,001
Do you think they lied?
Do you think they stole our horses?

144
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:56,369
-They dont need our shit horses.
-Watch your mouth.

145
00:25:08,562 --> 00:25:10,897
I'll take him into town on my own

146
00:25:10,962 --> 00:25:16,330
You boys go round up the herd.
Don't push them too hard, I can't afford any more dropping

147
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:20,298
Mr, we're going to have to lift you up
to get you on top of that horse

148
00:25:20,882 --> 00:25:22,704
Here comes the cavalry.

149
00:25:27,186 --> 00:25:29,488
Do as I said

150
00:25:34,994 --> 00:25:36,969
Is he from the coach?

151
00:25:37,010 --> 00:25:38,898
The only one that made it

152
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,996
-Mr. McElroy, can you hear me?
-It was Ben Wade

153
00:25:42,066 --> 00:25:43,822
Can you hear me?

154
00:25:44,882 --> 00:25:47,271
This man needs attention.

155
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:49,767
Did you see which way they rode, Evans?

156
00:25:50,418 --> 00:25:52,458
It seemed like they were headed to Bigsby

157
00:26:40,018 --> 00:26:45,648
You know, there is a little town just south of the border

158
00:26:46,610 --> 00:26:49,293
Pretty little pueblo (?)
Down by the river

159
00:26:50,962 --> 00:26:54,737
Folks would pay good money to hear
a white woman sing

160
00:26:55,986 --> 00:27:01,802
Yeah, imagine me (shinning on?) down to Mexico with Ben Wade on my arm

161
00:27:03,762 --> 00:27:10,440
I'm not wanted in Mexico.
Jump out that back windows with me now

162
00:27:15,154 --> 00:27:17,358
You're crazy.

163
00:27:21,778 --> 00:27:23,633
-Are you the Dr?
-Yes

164
00:27:23,698 --> 00:27:26,796
-Coach got held up
-Get him on the table.

165
00:27:34,738 --> 00:27:36,232
What's his name?

166
00:27:36,274 --> 00:27:40,136
Byron McElroy, he's a bounty hunter
under contract with the Pinkertons

167
00:27:47,538 --> 00:27:50,440
You've lost a lot of blood, Mr McElroy

168
00:27:55,986 --> 00:27:59,150
-That bullet is still in there
-Get it out

169
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:10,959
Allright.

170
00:28:10,994 --> 00:28:13,645
What I'm about to do
is going to hurt like a son of a bitch

171
00:28:13,682 --> 00:28:15,787
It ain't the first time I've been shot

172
00:28:16,338 --> 00:28:18,247
Hold him, please

173
00:28:20,978 --> 00:28:23,150
Don't touch me.

174
00:28:59,762 --> 00:29:06,762
- What the fuck kind of Doctor are you anyway?
- It's nice to have a conversation with a patient for a change

175
00:29:33,401 --> 00:29:36,500
What the hell are they looking for?

176
00:29:37,338 --> 00:29:39,029
Ben Wade

177
00:29:39,066 --> 00:29:41,553
He held up the payroll coach

178
00:29:43,098 --> 00:29:46,327
-I want to talk, Mr. Hollander.
-Ben Wade in Bigsby

179
00:29:46,362 --> 00:29:49,177
Shit, we're moving up

180
00:29:49,242 --> 00:29:50,867
Mr. Hollander.

181
00:29:50,906 --> 00:29:52,150
Tucker, I'm going to the saloon

182
00:29:52,442 --> 00:29:55,192
You've got no right to do what you've done
You hear me?

183
00:29:55,994 --> 00:29:57,204
It's my land

184
00:29:57,242 --> 00:30:01,399
Come next week it's not, Evans
You borrowed a good deal of money, 
and I got a right to (recompense?)

185
00:30:01,434 --> 00:30:05,176
But you damn up my creek. 
You shut off my water.
How do you expect me to pay off my debt if you...?

186
00:30:07,322 --> 00:30:15,156
Before water touches your land it resides and flows on mine.
And as such, I can do with it as I fucking please. 
Go home and pack up.

187
00:30:17,882 --> 00:30:20,915
Here, if you just give me till spring

188
00:30:24,185 --> 00:30:26,804
I can turn the corner

189
00:30:28,602 --> 00:30:32,431
Sometimes a man has to big enough
to see how small he is

190
00:30:33,402 --> 00:30:38,704
Railroad is coming, Dan
Your land is worth more with you off it

191
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:16,758
Hollander!

192
00:31:27,098 --> 00:31:32,367
You look a little bent, rancher.
You come to wake some snakes?

193
00:31:33,049 --> 00:31:35,537
Dan, would you like a drink?

194
00:31:35,577 --> 00:31:36,559
No thanks.

195
00:31:36,602 --> 00:31:39,668
You got your horses back, didn't you?
And your cattle?

196
00:31:41,626 --> 00:31:46,198
Yeah, I got my horses back,
but you killed two of my herd

197
00:31:46,233 --> 00:31:48,622
Hell, they died for a good cause.

198
00:31:51,706 --> 00:31:58,132
You know, them beasts of yours
They woulnd't even fetch 100 dollars.

199
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:04,887
I'll tell you what. That should cover it

200
00:32:08,026 --> 00:32:10,327
How much do you get for a day's work?

201
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:11,856
2 dollars, when I hire out

202
00:32:12,538 --> 00:32:14,393
There are 2 dollars for a half-day.

203
00:32:19,481 --> 00:32:21,936
You took up my boys' time too

204
00:32:26,394 --> 00:32:29,525
You're right, I did

205
00:32:36,826 --> 00:32:40,174
Anything else you want to get paid for, Dan?

206
00:32:42,618 --> 00:32:45,302
Give me 5 dollars extra.

207
00:32:46,906 --> 00:32:48,564
And what's that for?

208
00:32:48,602 --> 00:32:50,674
For making me nervous

209
00:32:52,025 --> 00:32:54,611
Hands up, Ben Wade.

210
00:32:56,090 --> 00:32:58,457
Boss!

211
00:33:01,369 --> 00:33:06,039
-Give me your hands, Mr. Wade
-Tucker take his gun
- Give me that

212
00:33:07,578 --> 00:33:09,585
Ben Wade

213
00:33:11,994 --> 00:33:14,382
Captured in Bigsby

214
00:33:15,002 --> 00:33:17,969
Be careful with that thing
My gun's got a curse on it

215
00:33:21,210 --> 00:33:23,032
Laugh while you can.

216
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:27,605
Crawley, go get the wagon. 
Make sure every weapons we've got is (shoot?) ready

217
00:33:27,641 --> 00:33:29,714
I'll meet you up front of the office.

218
00:33:29,754 --> 00:33:32,056
-Get him out of here.
-Sure thing

219
00:33:32,089 --> 00:33:35,024
I think we should shoot him right now

220
00:33:35,929 --> 00:33:38,318
Put a bullet right in his nogging

221
00:33:38,394 --> 00:33:42,704
If you do that, everybody in this
shit piss of a town will be dead by morning

222
00:33:48,602 --> 00:33:57,462
22 robberies, 
over 400 thousand dollars in losses
More in delays

223
00:33:57,946 --> 00:34:04,504
The Southern Pacific will have Ben Wade
convicted in a Federal court. Hanged

224
00:34:04,537 --> 00:34:08,399
...in public, an example made

225
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:11,857
And we will pay to make it happen

226
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:14,264
You all notice he didn't mention of the lives I've taken

227
00:34:14,329 --> 00:34:16,184
I need three more men.

228
00:34:16,249 --> 00:34:18,616
-You can have Tucker.
-Good

229
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:20,854
I'm coming, you only need one

230
00:34:20,890 --> 00:34:22,930
You're wounded, Mr. McElroy.

231
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:25,969
I rode in here. Sure as hell I can ride out

232
00:34:26,042 --> 00:34:29,391
-He goes, Potter's coming
-What?!

233
00:34:30,713 --> 00:34:32,601
Doc can't shoot shit

234
00:34:32,633 --> 00:34:36,976
I was better shot of my regiment. I'll come

235
00:34:38,810 --> 00:34:41,111
For 200 dollars.

236
00:34:42,841 --> 00:34:45,362
You fight for the north or the south?

237
00:34:45,946 --> 00:34:47,407
North.

238
00:34:47,450 --> 00:34:52,305
We are southern in name,
but Chicago owned. Fine

239
00:34:52,377 --> 00:34:54,133
200 dollars.

240
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:55,664
Let's go

241
00:35:06,394 --> 00:35:09,077
-Thank you
-Thank me when it's done

242
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:46,840
This town is going to burn!

243
00:35:50,522 --> 00:35:52,693
Let's get him, boys!

244
00:36:01,817 --> 00:36:04,119
Get in the coach

245
00:36:15,385 --> 00:36:21,081
God Damn it.
Evans, Crawley, Tucker 
you need to mount up now!

246
00:36:21,113 --> 00:36:24,496
Head for Evans' ranch
I'll mee you there with the coach

247
00:36:39,578 --> 00:36:41,879
How long does he have to be here?

248
00:36:41,913 --> 00:36:46,866
A day or so. Make sure his outfit takes the bait

249
00:37:14,842 --> 00:37:19,511
Hello there. Evans
Can you give me a hand with this?

250
00:37:27,513 --> 00:37:32,085
Whatever your wife is cooking in there, smells good, Evans

251
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:49,879
Let's go.

252
00:37:52,186 --> 00:37:54,193
Good driving, Marshal

253
00:38:07,161 --> 00:38:10,128
Remind me not to play poker in this town

254
00:38:11,386 --> 00:38:14,647
Well, Marshal, give us a count

255
00:38:14,681 --> 00:38:17,430
1... 2... 3...

256
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:39,792
Gonna check on my family when you come back, right?

257
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:41,208
First thing

258
00:39:05,442 --> 00:39:07,543
Madam

259
00:39:09,441 --> 00:39:12,889
Byron, an unpleasant surprise

260
00:39:14,241 --> 00:39:17,056
What happens if they catch the wagon?

261
00:39:17,121 --> 00:39:24,856
Well, you saw where his man was. He's still got to go fish the outfit.
Marshal's got a fast rig, they should reach the fort before dawn.

262
00:39:24,898 --> 00:39:28,280
His gang can't do anything in front of the whole sixth cavarly

263
00:39:42,593 --> 00:39:45,081
Did you have something to do with that?

264
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:49,464
I hope you are proud of yourself

265
00:39:52,449 --> 00:39:54,554
Just doing my job, Doc.

266
00:39:58,209 --> 00:39:59,835
Thanks, son

267
00:40:17,698 --> 00:40:20,119
We always wait to say grace

268
00:40:20,609 --> 00:40:22,878
We don't presume to teach other people manners

269
00:40:22,913 --> 00:40:25,564
Aren't we supposed to say grace for murderers too?

270
00:40:25,601 --> 00:40:28,601
-Grace is for everyone, dear
-Then why don't we say it?

271
00:40:28,641 --> 00:40:31,773
Mark, I'd like to hear it.

272
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:40,697
God, our father, Lord and Savior
Thank you for your love and favor

273
00:40:40,769 --> 00:40:46,039
Please bless this drink and food we pray
And bless all who share with us today

274
00:40:46,081 --> 00:40:47,576
Amen.

275
00:40:48,673 --> 00:40:50,298
Amen.

276
00:40:51,361 --> 00:40:56,347
If my pa' wanted to, he could shoot you dead
He can shoot a jack rabbit at 50 yards

277
00:40:57,185 --> 00:41:01,146
Shooting an animal is a lot different
than shooting a man, son

278
00:41:01,217 --> 00:41:06,236
Not, it isn't
Not in my opinion.

279
00:41:07,649 --> 00:41:15,516
We can ask Byron here.
Now Byron, he's killed dozens of people.
Men and women and children. Miners, Apaches

280
00:41:16,193 --> 00:41:20,350
Not a soul I've taken that didn't deserve what they've got

281
00:41:21,377 --> 00:41:28,927
"Every way of a man is right in his own eyes", Byron,
"but the Lord ponders the heart"

282
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:33,110
Proverbs 21

283
00:41:47,233 --> 00:41:48,989
Dan

284
00:41:54,145 --> 00:41:57,211
You eat more when you're nervous, Mr Butterfield?

285
00:41:58,177 --> 00:42:02,782
Why, thank you, Dan.
How pleasant and kind of you. Much appreciated it

286
00:42:03,265 --> 00:42:08,705
Could you cut that for me?
Could you cut that fat out, I don't particularly like the fat at all.

287
00:42:09,249 --> 00:42:10,940
Allright.

288
00:42:13,281 --> 00:42:16,729
And the (grissle?)
I don't like (grissle?)

289
00:42:23,137 --> 00:42:26,039
Do you mind if I ask you how you got
that hitch in your step, Dan?

290
00:42:26,081 --> 00:42:28,537
Don't tell him nothing, Mr Evans.

291
00:42:31,841 --> 00:42:34,427
Where were you stationed?

292
00:42:36,065 --> 00:42:39,993
7th company of sharpshooters, out of (?) Massachusetts

293
00:42:44,097 --> 00:42:48,221
My father was defending the US capital
in the District of Columbia

294
00:42:49,185 --> 00:42:52,763
Isn't that so?
Well, Dan. Tell me the story of
how you lost your leg

295
00:42:53,505 --> 00:42:58,393
Did they shoot it off? Cut it off?
Did the Indians do it?

296
00:43:08,673 --> 00:43:11,259
I saw something over there in the grass.

297
00:43:19,329 --> 00:43:21,369
There ain't nothing

298
00:43:29,699 --> 00:43:34,699
What if they caught up with the coach already?
What if they already know it's Crawley inside?

299
00:43:37,441 --> 00:43:39,808
Have you ever been to San Francisco?

300
00:43:41,921 --> 00:43:45,598
If it's all right by you, Mr. Wade,
I rather we not talk

301
00:43:46,465 --> 00:43:48,920
So you've never been in San Francisco?

302
00:43:50,177 --> 00:43:51,224
No.

303
00:43:55,201 --> 00:43:59,162
I know a girl there.
She's the daughter of a sea captain

304
00:43:59,201 --> 00:44:02,071
She had the most beautiful green eyes

305
00:44:03,329 --> 00:44:06,046
The greenest eyes
I ever saw

306
00:44:11,425 --> 00:44:13,530
Like yours.

307
00:44:17,185 --> 00:44:20,895
When I stared deep into them
they'd just change color in front of me

308
00:44:20,929 --> 00:44:23,351
All the colors of the sea.

309
00:44:31,777 --> 00:44:33,981
What did you say your name was again?

310
00:44:34,561 --> 00:44:36,219
Alice.

311
00:44:48,481 --> 00:44:52,190
For God's sake, he's killed more men than the (drought?)

312
00:44:52,225 --> 00:44:53,948
He is not what I expected

313
00:44:54,337 --> 00:44:57,632
He is dangerous
Dangerous is what he is, Alice.

314
00:44:58,113 --> 00:45:00,764
I don't want you or the boys
talking to him

315
00:45:02,337 --> 00:45:07,422
You can change your mind, Dan
None will think less of you

316
00:45:08,737 --> 00:45:12,184
None can think less of me

317
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:16,890
6 months from now, everything is going to be great

318
00:45:17,441 --> 00:45:19,415
Cows are going to be fat

319
00:45:19,841 --> 00:45:23,070
We might even see the steam
from the train coming over the ridge

320
00:45:24,353 --> 00:45:31,903
We will be allright, but we won't make it through
the next 6 days, if I don't do this

321
00:45:36,929 --> 00:45:40,277
Sorry, Dan. McElroy says 5 minutes

322
00:45:51,233 --> 00:45:54,080
Do you think it's too much for me?

323
00:45:55,425 --> 00:45:57,628
He's a killer, Daniel.

324
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:03,485
Yet somehow I have the decency
to bring him to justice.

325
00:46:07,521 --> 00:46:10,238
What are you thinking?

326
00:46:11,265 --> 00:46:15,421
I am not out there alone
Have a little faith in me

327
00:46:16,288 --> 00:46:20,380
Ben Wade has a gang
And they're out there tonight, somewhere

328
00:46:20,417 --> 00:46:26,200
If I don't go, we have to pack up and leave
and God knows where w/o a prayer to (?)

329
00:46:26,273 --> 00:46:30,616
Now, I am tired, Alice
I'm tired of watching my boys go hungry

330
00:46:30,688 --> 00:46:34,714
... I'm tired of the way they look at me
I'm tired of the way that you don't

331
00:46:35,393 --> 00:46:43,260
I've been standing on one leg for 3 damned years,
waiting for God to do me a favor

332
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:47,674
And he ain't listening

333
00:46:49,313 --> 00:46:50,687
Mr. Evans.

334
00:47:01,601 --> 00:47:05,824
No, no, no. This is my horse now

335
00:47:09,184 --> 00:47:11,006
Come over here

336
00:47:18,432 --> 00:47:21,781
-Don't give me any trouble, Mark
-Yes, sir

337
00:47:25,185 --> 00:47:26,811
Boy.

338
00:47:26,881 --> 00:47:29,052
-I want to come with you
-Well, you can't

339
00:47:29,089 --> 00:47:30,202
I can help.

340
00:47:30,241 --> 00:47:32,248
You're 14 years old.

341
00:47:32,289 --> 00:47:35,802
I can ride faster and
you shoot better than any one of them.

342
00:47:35,841 --> 00:47:41,078
The Pinkerton is hurt, Potter is no good,
that railroad man is dead weight, and that other bastard...

343
00:47:41,857 --> 00:47:45,021
I dont have time to argue
I need you here.

344
00:47:45,057 --> 00:47:46,846
That's that
That's that

345
00:47:52,992 --> 00:47:55,676
So, boys, where are we headed?

346
00:47:55,713 --> 00:48:04,889
It ain't none of your business where we are headed, Wade.
You're a prisoner. You don't speak, you don't piss.
You don't god damn breathe unless we say so.

347
00:48:05,313 --> 00:48:07,484
Do you understand that?

348
00:48:10,401 --> 00:48:16,446
We're taking you to Contention
Putting you on the 3:10 to Yuma, day after tomorrow

349
00:48:16,481 --> 00:48:18,303
You shouldn't have told him, now.

350
00:48:18,753 --> 00:48:23,871
Relax, friend. Now if we get separated
I'll know where to meet up

351
00:48:27,329 --> 00:48:32,958
I'd like tol thank you for your hospitality, Madame
I hope I can send your husband back allright

352
00:49:05,408 --> 00:49:09,816
What did Ben Wade mean about
sending Pa' back all right?
Is he saying he was going to kill him?

353
00:49:09,856 --> 00:49:14,166
Ben Wade don't have to lift a finger,
his gang will do it for him.

354
00:49:16,641 --> 00:49:19,543
Your father can take care of himself

355
00:50:02,817 --> 00:50:09,079
So, were you conscripted into Lincoln's army, Mr. Evans?
Or did you volunteered?

356
00:50:09,120 --> 00:50:11,128
Neither...

357
00:50:13,056 --> 00:50:14,431
Maybe both.

358
00:50:14,464 --> 00:50:16,188
What does that means?

359
00:50:16,673 --> 00:50:26,078
It means I was a volunteer for the Massachusetts State Guard
Then in 62 the Federal government was running low on men
so they called in the state militias

360
00:50:26,656 --> 00:50:30,813
-To protect Washinton.
-And that's when you got hurt

361
00:50:34,624 --> 00:50:39,992
What are you doing out here, Dan?
You've got a family to protect.

362
00:50:41,056 --> 00:50:44,799
You are not a law man, 
you don't work for the railroad 
like Mr. shinny shoes over there

363
00:50:44,832 --> 00:50:47,199
Not a Pinkerton

364
00:50:47,968 --> 00:50:52,278
Maybe I don't like the idea of
men like you running loose

365
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:56,125
It's man's nature
to take what he wants, Dan

366
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:57,916
It's how we are born

367
00:50:57,953 --> 00:51:01,815
Well, I make an honest living

368
00:51:01,889 --> 00:51:05,184
It might be honest, but I don't think it's much of a living

369
00:51:05,217 --> 00:51:08,250
you must be hurting bad for money
to take this job

370
00:51:09,889 --> 00:51:11,711
Go to sleep.

371
00:51:15,872 --> 00:51:19,036
I imagine debt puts
a lot of pressure on a marriage

372
00:51:19,104 --> 00:51:22,749
Are you married?
What would you know about marriage?

373
00:51:23,904 --> 00:51:26,904
We can't all be cutthroats and thieves

374
00:51:26,976 --> 00:51:31,286
Well, I know that if I was lucky enough to have a wife
like Alice, I'd treat her a whole lot better than you do, Dan

375
00:51:32,001 --> 00:51:37,435
I'd feed her better, I'd buy her pretty dresses.
I wouldn't make her work so hard.

376
00:51:39,937 --> 00:51:43,450
Yeah, I'd bet Alice was a real pretty girl before she married you...

377
00:51:43,489 --> 00:51:50,494
Don't talk about my wife. You shut up about her.
You say one more word and I cut your tongue.

378
00:51:53,089 --> 00:51:55,740
I'd like the sight of it if you did.

379
00:51:55,776 --> 00:51:57,500
Mr. Evans.

380
00:52:04,064 --> 00:52:06,650
It's my watch, now

381
00:52:38,855 --> 00:52:43,855
#Gonna hang me in the morning
#For the night is done

382
00:52:46,503 --> 00:52:51,503
#Gonna hang me in the morning
#I'll never see the sun

383
00:52:51,008 --> 00:52:54,750
I suppose it's too much to ask for a little quiet.

384
00:52:55,904 --> 00:53:01,818
The way I figured it: I'd be asleep in my
own bed right now if it weren't for you

385
00:53:02,464 --> 00:53:06,872
So if I've got to be up,
you damn well be up with me too,

386
00:53:06,912 --> 00:53:09,563
Ben Wade.

387
00:53:40,576 --> 00:53:42,715
Son of a bitch!

388
00:53:57,812 --> 00:53:59,667
Enough.

389
00:54:03,092 --> 00:54:06,059
-Enough!
-That's enough, McElroy

390
00:54:18,389 --> 00:54:20,494
We have to bury him.

391
00:54:21,332 --> 00:54:26,929
If you take the time to dig one grave
you might as well dig one for yourself

392
00:54:29,876 --> 00:54:32,534
Let's go.
Mount up

393
00:54:33,460 --> 00:54:38,460
#Gonna hang me in the morning

394
00:54:43,632 --> 00:54:46,632
#I'll never see the sun
[Laughs]

395
00:55:57,417 --> 00:56:00,962
Don't worry there, Boss
We're going to get you out of there in a second

396
00:56:15,388 --> 00:56:17,625
Wait!
Wait!

397
00:56:19,037 --> 00:56:21,426
Sutherland.

398
00:56:25,468 --> 00:56:27,191
Jackson

399
00:56:35,869 --> 00:56:37,079
No, No.
Don't do this

400
00:56:37,852 --> 00:56:41,780
Don't do this.
Don't do this.

401
00:56:42,047 --> 00:56:42,996
Where is he?

402
00:56:43,328 --> 00:56:46,077
Open the door. Open the door!
Let me out of here, God damn it!

403
00:56:46,368 --> 00:56:47,229
Where did they take him?

404
00:56:47,616 --> 00:56:48,663
I don't know!

405
00:56:53,792 --> 00:56:56,759
Mr., you'd better tell me where they took him...

406
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,454
...or you will burn

407
00:57:05,951 --> 00:57:06,813
Contention!
Allright?!

408
00:57:07,584 --> 00:57:08,828
They're going to Contention

409
00:57:09,408 --> 00:57:12,856
They're going to put him on the
3:10 to Yuma prison. Tomorrow

410
00:57:16,896 --> 00:57:17,943
Let me go out of here!

411
00:57:21,407 --> 00:57:26,110
Contention is... 80 miles
back to the other way.

412
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:28,317
They've just about killed our horses

413
00:57:28,704 --> 00:57:30,231
So, we'll buy new ones.

414
00:57:31,871 --> 00:57:34,773
Charlie, it's his own fault he got caught
He made a mistake.

415
00:57:37,536 --> 00:57:39,805
You think you can do a better job
leading this group?

416
00:57:40,544 --> 00:57:41,307
Maybe...

417
00:57:47,008 --> 00:57:50,139
You've forgotten what he
done for us?

418
00:57:56,479 --> 00:57:57,625
We're going to Contention!

419
00:58:09,536 --> 00:58:11,543
Can't say I didn't warn you

420
00:58:15,040 --> 00:58:16,469
There's a shortcut we can take

421
00:58:17,504 --> 00:58:18,169
A shortcut?

422
00:58:18,880 --> 00:58:19,828
Through the pass

423
00:58:20,384 --> 00:58:21,627
It takes you right through Contention

424
00:58:22,016 --> 00:58:22,998
Why didnt you say something before?

425
00:58:23,455 --> 00:58:24,884
It's Apache country

426
00:58:25,567 --> 00:58:29,047
-I thought that the government gave them land.
-These are the ones who refused to go.

427
00:58:29,504 --> 00:58:31,806
-I wouldn't take that path
-You want us to take the long way?

428
00:58:32,128 --> 00:58:34,135
-That's right
-and let your boys catch us?

429
00:58:36,543 --> 00:58:40,700
Mr.. Butterfield, the Apache who lived
in that path are the ones that stayed to fight

430
00:58:41,824 --> 00:58:43,166
They enjoy killing

431
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:45,367
You ain't going to make it

432
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:50,745
We'll take our chances

433
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,646
Something on your mind, Dan?

434
00:59:21,696 --> 00:59:22,743
Why did you kill Tucker?

435
00:59:24,095 --> 00:59:26,299
Why not me? Or Butterfield?

436
00:59:27,167 --> 00:59:28,661
Hell, Tucker took my horse.

437
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:32,727
Did you liked him, Dan?
-No

438
00:59:34,591 --> 00:59:36,479
He told me he burned down your barn

439
00:59:38,591 --> 00:59:39,540
He was an asshole

440
00:59:41,504 --> 00:59:43,871
But wishing him dead and
killing him are two different things

441
00:59:44,928 --> 00:59:46,750
Your conscience is sensitive, Dan

442
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,080
I don't think it's my
favorite part of you.

443
00:59:50,336 --> 00:59:54,907
(?), Mr. Wade. If you want to
talk to somebody, talk to me.

444
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,407
I don't like talking to you, Byron

445
00:59:58,016 --> 00:59:59,423
Not when I have the gun.

446
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,815
No, that ain't it.
I just don't find you that interesting.

447
01:00:04,032 --> 01:00:06,421
Laugh it up, Doc. 'till he
guts you like a fish

448
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:08,630
Byron is like a song with one note

449
01:00:09,407 --> 01:00:11,644
Did you ever read another book in your
life, Byron. Besides the Bible?

450
01:00:12,127 --> 01:00:12,988
No need

451
01:00:17,024 --> 01:00:19,675
Byron acts pius. A few years ago when
he was under contract with Central,

452
01:00:20,448 --> 01:00:22,684
I've seen him and a bunch of brother Pinks ...

453
01:00:23,424 --> 01:00:25,366
... mow down 32 Apache women and children

454
01:00:26,495 --> 01:00:29,512
Renegades. Gunning down railroad men and their families ...

455
01:00:29,856 --> 01:00:32,028
... picking them off the road, one by one. Scalped.

456
01:00:33,055 --> 01:00:36,350
There was young'nes running around.
Crying and screaming
No more than 3 years old

457
01:00:37,024 --> 01:00:40,635
... and his boys shot them all
and pushed them into a ditch

458
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,454
Some of them were still crying

459
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:48,505
I guess Byron figured that Jesus
wouldn't mind

460
01:00:50,431 --> 01:00:52,471
Apparently Jesus don't like the Apache

461
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:55,031
Keep on talking...

462
01:00:56,255 --> 01:01:02,836
All the way to Yuma. Right up on them steps
to the rope. Straight to hell

463
01:01:03,679 --> 01:01:04,923
Yeah, the day I die, Byron

464
01:01:05,824 --> 01:01:07,318
I'm getting sprung from hell

465
01:01:08,031 --> 01:01:14,523
I might feel the same, if I'd come from the seed of a
drunk grave digger and the rancid womb of a whore

466
01:01:28,191 --> 01:01:28,857
Drop it, Dan Evans.
Drop it

467
01:01:29,632 --> 01:01:30,679
Toss it to the ground, Doc

468
01:01:32,063 --> 01:01:33,307
Mr. Butterfield...

469
01:01:36,927 --> 01:01:42,972
I believe, Dan, you're carrying a pistol as well.
I'd appreciate it if you take it out
and drop it on the ground. Thank you

470
01:01:49,331 --> 01:01:54,331
Now, I've always liked you, Byron, ...

471
01:01:53,247 --> 01:01:54,808
..., but you never knew when to shut up

472
01:01:58,911 --> 01:02:01,016
Even bad men love their mommas

473
01:02:06,239 --> 01:02:08,127
Now I think it's time
for everybody to go home

474
01:02:09,311 --> 01:02:10,521
Don't you move, Mr. Wade.

475
01:02:11,487 --> 01:02:12,632
Let go of that shotgun.

476
01:02:14,655 --> 01:02:16,957
William, what the hell are you doing here?

477
01:02:18,495 --> 01:02:21,917
I don't think that you're going to shoot a man (?)
in the back of the head, boy

478
01:02:23,040 --> 01:02:25,611
Dan, tell your boy it's over

479
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:29,175
You think you can keep you gun on him, William?

480
01:02:30,239 --> 01:02:33,149
I'm doing a damn sight better than you did

481
01:03:17,492 --> 01:03:19,215
You ever been to Dodge City?

482
01:03:22,963 --> 01:03:23,911
No.

483
01:03:25,587 --> 01:03:26,732
Stop talking to him

484
01:03:31,859 --> 01:03:34,226
The way you're shuffling those cards,
I took you for a pro

485
01:03:35,571 --> 01:03:36,716
I practice a lot.

486
01:03:37,331 --> 01:03:38,062
I can tell

487
01:03:46,035 --> 01:03:46,984
You ever been to Dodge?

488
01:03:47,475 --> 01:03:48,423
Yes, indeed

489
01:03:49,811 --> 01:03:52,364
Meanest, most beautiful, dirty city there ever was

490
01:03:52,851 --> 01:03:58,253
Saloons just overflowing with cattle drivers and road agents,
prospectors, gunslingers, gamblers and women

491
01:04:01,587 --> 01:04:03,442
Women will do things to you you'll never forget.

492
01:04:05,811 --> 01:04:07,436
They'll give you disease you'll never forget

493
01:04:07,859 --> 01:04:11,088
Money in your pocket in Dodge City
you can have everything a man ever wished for

494
01:04:13,811 --> 01:04:15,055
Everything a man comes to need

495
01:04:18,803 --> 01:04:21,007
I got (?) I was a boy not much bigger than you

496
01:04:22,580 --> 01:04:24,881
Now, how many men have you killed since then, Wade?

497
01:04:27,923 --> 01:04:29,352
How many families have you destroyed?

498
01:04:33,819 --> 01:04:36,023
Quite a few

499
01:04:39,388 --> 01:04:44,276
Is it true that you dynamited a wagon
full of prospectors in the Western Territories last spring?

500
01:04:45,052 --> 01:04:45,913
No, that's a lie.

501
01:04:47,068 --> 01:04:48,311
It was a train full

502
01:04:57,371 --> 01:04:58,386
(?), Dan

503
01:05:01,647 --> 01:05:02,825
I gotta take a piss

504
01:05:05,872 --> 01:05:07,660
You know, I thought he was going to
shoot me back in the ravine

505
01:05:09,647 --> 01:05:10,891
I really thought he was going to do it

506
01:05:11,203 --> 01:05:12,763
There was a wildness in his eyes.
He reminds me ...

507
01:05:13,187 --> 01:05:14,496
He's going to be nothing like you, Wade

508
01:05:20,419 --> 01:05:22,875
A man's got to have a head start
on the path of decency

509
01:05:25,603 --> 01:05:28,189
Yeah, that's why I don't mess around
with doing anything good, Dan.

510
01:05:33,251 --> 01:05:34,713
Dou do one good deed for somebody...

511
01:05:36,259 --> 01:05:37,688
I imagine it's habit forming

512
01:05:39,524 --> 01:05:43,135
Something decent. See that grateful
look in their eyes....

513
01:05:43,747 --> 01:05:45,635
... I imagine it makes feel like christ hisself

514
01:05:46,019 --> 01:05:48,321
I've had enough of this, Wade.
Come on. Let's go

515
01:06:41,220 --> 01:06:43,325
It's three of them
-Yours?

516
01:06:43,811 --> 01:06:45,055
If they were mine, you'd be dead

517
01:06:48,419 --> 01:06:49,368
Give me that gun, Wade!

518
01:07:38,275 --> 01:07:39,355
I told you not to come this way

519
01:07:40,483 --> 01:07:41,858
It was McElroy's decision.

520
01:07:42,339 --> 01:07:43,452
I told you there'd be trouble

521
01:07:49,027 --> 01:07:50,172
Give me the keys to the handcuffs

522
01:08:16,239 --> 01:08:17,254
Easy. Easy now

523
01:08:18,607 --> 01:08:19,501
Where is he?

524
01:08:20,335 --> 01:08:21,131
He's gone

525
01:08:23,939 --> 01:08:27,143
He took the horses with him.
I found this in the grass

526
01:08:33,623 --> 01:08:38,379
That's the quickest way out of the pass
He'll be looking for help, to get his cuffs off

527
01:08:40,075 --> 01:08:41,285
We are going after him.

528
01:08:42,539 --> 01:08:45,408
There ain't no reward for getting him
halfway to that train, is there?

529
01:09:56,587 --> 01:09:59,653
I've got to be honest with you,
I like some of their food.

530
01:10:00,235 --> 01:10:02,821
As for wanting $40 a month now,
I can...

531
01:10:04,299 --> 01:10:05,226
Hello, Love.

532
01:10:06,411 --> 01:10:10,185
God damned Coolies. They'll work just fine
with my left boot up their ass

533
01:10:10,475 --> 01:10:12,646
Well, if I could teach a monkey
to lay track, ...

534
01:10:13,931 --> 01:10:16,517
Well. What we need here are some negros
brought here, Mister Boles

535
01:10:17,003 --> 01:10:18,694
Show these Chinamen what real work is

536
01:10:27,051 --> 01:10:28,480
Holly Christ!

537
01:10:30,123 --> 01:10:31,170
Who is that?

538
01:10:32,139 --> 01:10:33,186
That's him!

539
01:10:36,075 --> 01:10:38,213
-Help me with the handcuffs

540
01:10:41,066 --> 01:10:42,822
Break the chain.
Use the hammer.
Break the chain.

541
01:10:47,019 --> 01:10:49,736
I have 5 guns on you out here, Ben Wade

542
01:10:50,283 --> 01:10:51,330
Just come on out!

543
01:11:10,187 --> 01:11:10,983
The horses.

544
01:11:33,227 --> 01:11:34,274
What the hell is going on here?

545
01:11:37,451 --> 01:11:40,321
Mr. Butterfield, all finished in Bigsby?

546
01:11:40,811 --> 01:11:41,574
Mr. Boles

547
01:11:49,579 --> 01:11:52,743
You'd better hurry. We're making the last blasts
through the mountains this week.

548
01:11:53,322 --> 01:11:54,151
That's my prisoner.

549
01:11:54,667 --> 01:11:57,350
We're taking him to Contention,
putting him on the prison train to Yuma.

550
01:11:58,763 --> 01:11:59,908
What prisoner?

551
01:12:00,875 --> 01:12:04,071
Come now, Mr. Boles. That's
Ben Wade you have there

552
01:12:04,746 --> 01:12:08,325
Ben Wade gunned down my kid brother, ...

553
01:12:08,403 --> 01:12:10,432
... in front of me, 6 years ago in Abeline

554
01:12:11,115 --> 01:12:13,089
Your brother was a lying (?) card shark

555
01:12:16,683 --> 01:12:22,312
That is, if he is the asshole I remember.
He could of course be some other asshole I've killed
that I've forgot about

556
01:12:36,574 --> 01:12:38,844
You can't do that. That's immoral.

557
01:12:41,319 --> 01:12:42,977
Immoral ain't got a damned thing to do with it

558
01:12:48,027 --> 01:12:50,710
I was expecting to collect a $200 reward for that man.

559
01:12:53,146 --> 01:12:56,408
I'm delivering him to Contention,
I need that money.

560
01:12:57,242 --> 01:12:59,769
Need it bad enough to die?

561
01:13:08,731 --> 01:13:11,618
At least let us take our horses.

562
01:13:12,443 --> 01:13:13,887
I've got no problem with that

563
01:13:14,587 --> 01:13:16,277
As long as you ride away, Mr.

564
01:13:17,819 --> 01:13:20,062
Nice knowing you, Dan

565
01:14:37,371 --> 01:14:38,298
God damn it!

566
01:14:52,635 --> 01:14:56,779
Did we make it?
Did we get away?

567
01:14:56,986 --> 01:14:59,637
Yeah, Doc. We did

568
01:15:01,563 --> 01:15:02,904
Thanks to you.

569
01:15:26,331 --> 01:15:31,120
We need a place to lay low. Keep him
out of sight 'till the train comes

570
01:15:32,218 --> 01:15:36,113
There is a hotel up here, I'll check to see,
and you ride around back

571
01:15:45,914 --> 01:15:49,957
Hey, Will. You keep a watch on the rail head
You see them coming...

572
01:15:50,042 --> 01:15:51,387
I'll let you know

573
01:15:52,634 --> 01:15:53,616
William!

574
01:16:11,346 --> 01:16:13,346
There's a Can-Can on the outs, if you're interested...

575
01:16:30,843 --> 01:16:34,039
It's the Bridal Suite,
I hope you don't mind, it's all they had

576
01:16:50,351 --> 01:16:53,456
Well, well. That looks like rain clouds over Bigsby

577
01:16:54,518 --> 01:16:56,925
You still need that $200, Dan?

578
01:16:56,938 --> 01:16:58,247
Shut up

579
01:17:00,395 --> 01:17:03,711
Mr.. Evans, you continue to give
me great confidence

580
01:17:06,794 --> 01:17:09,136
I'm going to see about the Marshal.

581
01:17:25,919 --> 01:17:31,320
We're looking for a group escorting
and outlaw by the name of Ben Wade

582
01:17:31,679 --> 01:17:33,686
Yeah, we've been chasing them
through these tunnels

583
01:17:39,634 --> 01:17:40,528
Who you are?

584
01:17:41,106 --> 01:17:42,121
What's it to you?

585
01:17:43,282 --> 01:17:44,941
Ben Wade killed my brother.

586
01:17:45,683 --> 01:17:47,690
Then your brother must be famous

587
01:17:51,410 --> 01:17:55,055
Are you, boys, some kind of posse?

588
01:18:05,874 --> 01:18:07,500
I hate posses

589
01:18:15,570 --> 01:18:17,097
So this is the Bridal Suite.

590
01:18:18,450 --> 01:18:22,225
Now, I wonder how many brides
have taken in this view

591
01:18:26,066 --> 01:18:27,757
What are you going to do with your $200 now, Dan?

592
01:18:28,242 --> 01:18:29,769
Now that the rains are coming

593
01:18:31,251 --> 01:18:34,480
I owe people money, Wade.
That drought left me in the hole

594
01:18:37,746 --> 01:18:39,568
What do you think about double that amount?

595
01:18:41,203 --> 01:18:44,683
You can pay your debts,
buy a hundred more cows

596
01:18:45,651 --> 01:18:46,796
Build a new barn

597
01:18:47,315 --> 01:18:48,744
How do you reckon I'm going to do that?

598
01:18:51,442 --> 01:18:54,704
Just lay down your gun 
and let me walk out the door. 
It's worth $400 (?)

599
01:18:56,915 --> 01:18:58,409
Is that what you reckon my price is?

600
01:18:59,762 --> 01:19:00,809
No...

601
01:19:03,218 --> 01:19:07,382
No, I reckon it's a thousand
One thousand dollars

602
01:19:07,539 --> 01:19:10,027
There was ten times that amount
in Butterfield's coach

603
01:19:11,090 --> 01:19:13,960
Do you want my cut, Dan?
It's all yours.

604
01:19:15,315 --> 01:19:17,519
Isn't that kind of reckless of you Wade?

605
01:19:18,562 --> 01:19:21,962
Seeing that... Hmmm. You're so sure that
your crew is coming to get you

606
01:19:23,890 --> 01:19:25,003
Oh, they're coming, Dan

607
01:19:26,866 --> 01:19:28,939
Sure as God's vengeance, they're coming

608
01:19:32,018 --> 01:19:33,774
But I just like to do things easy

609
01:19:36,242 --> 01:19:38,249
Imagine what you can do with $1000, Dan?

610
01:19:39,411 --> 01:19:42,477
You can hire a couple of ranch hands.
Your boys could go to school, grow up smart.

611
01:19:43,442 --> 01:19:45,003
What about Alice?

612
01:19:46,162 --> 01:19:49,326
She wouuld be the proud wife
of a bonafide Arizona rancher

613
01:19:52,403 --> 01:19:54,126
All you've got to do is say yes

614
01:20:02,578 --> 01:20:07,499
Will you give me a bank note, Wade?
Or will you be kind enough to make a deposit for me?

615
01:20:08,082 --> 01:20:09,031
Cash.

616
01:20:14,034 --> 01:20:18,889
You tell me, Wade. How will I
account for that amount of money?

617
01:20:20,914 --> 01:20:24,013
What will I tell people when I spend it?

618
01:20:24,370 --> 01:20:30,121
That you got the jump on me, you escaped,
and somehow I got a fortune

619
01:20:34,098 --> 01:20:35,440
No. How dumb do you think people are?

620
01:20:36,563 --> 01:20:37,807
Nobody needs to know

621
01:20:41,971 --> 01:20:42,919
Do you know what?

622
01:20:43,506 --> 01:20:44,302
Would you do me a favor?

623
01:20:45,907 --> 01:20:47,433
Don't talk to me for a while.

624
01:20:48,626 --> 01:20:50,353
You mean 
we're still not friends?

625
01:20:51,090 --> 01:20:55,116
No. No, we're not

626
01:20:56,850 --> 01:21:01,073
Come 5 minutes to 3, we're going to be 
a hell of a lot closer than you think

627
01:21:08,562 --> 01:21:12,490
#They're gonna hang me in the morning

628
01:21:14,546 --> 01:21:17,034
#For the night is done

629
01:21:18,386 --> 01:21:22,609
#They're gonna hang me in the morning

630
01:21:24,690 --> 01:21:27,079
#I'll never see the sun

631
01:21:42,099 --> 01:21:42,665
Who is it?

632
01:21:43,155 --> 01:21:44,303
It's me, Dan

633
01:21:45,075 --> 01:21:46,023
I brought help

634
01:21:46,995 --> 01:21:49,820
You've been gone for a long time, Mr. Butterfield

635
01:21:50,162 --> 01:21:53,464
How do I know someone ain't got
a gun on you out there?

636
01:22:08,019 --> 01:22:10,124
Dan, this is Marshal Will Doane

637
01:22:10,995 --> 01:22:13,296
Marshal
-Mr. Evans

638
01:22:15,346 --> 01:22:17,255
Two of my finest men

639
01:22:23,282 --> 01:22:26,002
I'm sorry about all that, Marshal,
I am grateful for the help

640
01:22:26,290 --> 01:22:27,305
Don't mention it

641
01:22:27,794 --> 01:22:30,550
So, you fellows are really going
to help to put me on this train?

642
01:22:31,538 --> 01:22:33,545
It might not seem like it, Mr.. Wade,

643
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:36,751
but we got law and order in this town,
just like in any other

644
01:22:37,042 --> 01:22:39,847
Well, that's very reassuring, Marshal

645
01:22:40,242 --> 01:22:41,966
How much money is Butterfield paying you?

646
01:22:42,514 --> 01:22:44,659
That's not of your business

647
01:22:45,298 --> 01:22:46,160
You're coming with us?

648
01:22:46,834 --> 01:22:48,012
I'll be walking with you

649
01:22:49,170 --> 01:22:50,414
Every step of the way.

650
01:22:52,114 --> 01:22:53,162
You have my word on that, Dan

651
01:22:53,938 --> 01:22:57,240
That makes five of us. Five is good

652
01:23:00,696 --> 01:23:05,696
It ain't enough

653
01:23:02,194 --> 01:23:03,623
It ain't nearly enough

654
01:23:26,322 --> 01:23:27,151
Pa!

655
01:23:27,538 --> 01:23:28,400
That's my boy

656
01:23:31,122 --> 01:23:31,886
They're coming.

657
01:23:34,514 --> 01:23:35,862
They are coming this way I've seen them
-Where?

658
01:23:35,954 --> 01:23:37,961
About a mile out, same way we come

659
01:23:38,322 --> 01:23:40,045
how many are they?
-Seven, ... Eight.

660
01:23:40,434 --> 01:23:42,775
Which is it? 7 or 8?

661
01:23:45,446 --> 01:23:46,591
Seven.

662
01:23:57,351 --> 01:24:01,857
Folks, sorry to bother you, but I'm going
to need you to move outside as quickly as possible

663
01:24:02,726 --> 01:24:06,271
That's it, folks.
Move along

664
01:24:15,706 --> 01:24:16,502
Right there.

665
01:24:34,554 --> 01:24:38,515
Sure there're a lot of them
- You'd figure, with it being the whole gang

666
01:25:03,258 --> 01:25:05,265
Boss?
Boss?

667
01:25:08,058 --> 01:25:09,006
Boss, are you are in there?

668
01:25:10,394 --> 01:25:11,703
What do you want me to tell them?

669
01:25:13,530 --> 01:25:15,832
You tell them you'll write 
them a letter every day from Yuma

670
01:25:24,570 --> 01:25:25,715
Be careful, Wade.

671
01:25:31,002 --> 01:25:32,912
Charlie,
Boys.

672
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:38,097
Charlie, why don't you take the boys 
down to the saloon and boy them a drink

673
01:25:40,218 --> 01:25:41,364
Are you ok?

674
01:25:42,522 --> 01:25:45,424
I am fine. Just sitting up here with
my 4 new friends

675
01:25:48,122 --> 01:25:49,234
That's enough

676
01:25:54,234 --> 01:25:55,379
Thank You, Charlie.

677
01:26:15,642 --> 01:26:16,535
Listen up!

678
01:26:17,210 --> 01:26:18,322
Listen up!!

679
01:26:20,250 --> 01:26:22,072
That's Ben Wade they have up there!

680
01:26:23,514 --> 01:26:25,619
Ben Wade!

681
01:26:30,362 --> 01:26:33,907
Now, the railroad intends...

682
01:26:36,698 --> 01:26:41,237
... to put him on the 3:10 to Yuma and hang him

683
01:26:42,298 --> 01:26:43,411
What's he doing?

684
01:26:49,593 --> 01:26:53,423
We will give you $300 cash

685
01:26:54,745 --> 01:26:58,041
To any man who shoots 
anyone of his captors

686
01:26:59,450 --> 01:27:02,995
$200 cash guaranteed!

687
01:27:09,145 --> 01:27:11,928
$200 guaranteed!

688
01:27:17,882 --> 01:27:19,027
I'll take $200
Give me the money

689
01:27:19,353 --> 01:27:21,077
You've got to shoot them first

690
01:27:27,514 --> 01:27:29,816
It's gotta be 30 or 40 with guns out there now

691
01:27:31,578 --> 01:27:32,626
The hell with this!

692
01:27:34,036 --> 01:27:36,036
Now, just a minute, Marshal

693
01:27:37,165 --> 01:27:43,365
Now, look. If it's a fair fight, sure. 
I'd stay for that. A fair fight ...

694
01:27:43,936 --> 01:27:45,936
That's a man's duty, but...

695
01:27:46,819 --> 01:27:48,819
There's only 5 of us

696
01:27:49,554 --> 01:27:53,237
I'm sorry, Mr, but I'm not going to die here today

697
01:27:56,796 --> 01:27:58,096
And neither are my men

698
01:27:58,107 --> 01:27:59,107
Marshal, ...

699
01:28:02,260 --> 01:28:04,560
You forgot this

700
01:28:08,966 --> 01:28:09,827
Marshal?

701
01:28:16,086 --> 01:28:19,646
Now, you see, Dan. Generally, ...

702
01:28:19,718 --> 01:28:20,863
... pretty much everyone ...

703
01:28:21,542 --> 01:28:22,469
.... wants to live

704
01:28:22,821 --> 01:28:24,070
I'll double your money

705
01:28:24,262 --> 01:28:25,244
Let's go, boys

706
01:28:25,798 --> 01:28:28,384
Please, do you want to see
us shot down in the street?

707
01:28:28,774 --> 01:28:29,919
This thing happened in Bigsby

708
01:28:30,501 --> 01:28:31,581
That means Butterfield too

709
01:28:31,942 --> 01:28:33,287
Why bring your troubles to Contention?

710
01:28:33,478 --> 01:28:36,166
We've got families
Everyone of us is a family man

711
01:28:36,454 --> 01:28:37,599
I'm a family man too

712
01:28:38,566 --> 01:28:40,908
He's gona walk out on you

713
01:28:41,830 --> 01:28:44,739
Then you'd best get out
like the rest of us

714
01:28:48,485 --> 01:28:52,380
He's (not?) gonna come back up here
He's gonna walk out on you

715
01:28:52,966 --> 01:28:58,472
Now, what you've got to figure
is why you and your boy are gonna die ...

716
01:29:01,414 --> 01:29:04,519
... because of Butterfield's railroad loss of money?

717
01:29:32,838 --> 01:29:33,983
They're all of them?

718
01:29:39,078 --> 01:29:39,971
Almost.

719
01:29:42,822 --> 01:29:44,066
Your move, general

720
01:29:48,198 --> 01:29:49,958
What do you expect him to say?

721
01:29:50,374 --> 01:29:51,934
I expect him to say something that makes sense.

722
01:29:52,902 --> 01:29:55,047
Something that might save the two of you.

723
01:29:55,509 --> 01:29:59,135
Take a look, Dan
What's the matter? You don't want to see?

724
01:30:00,102 --> 01:30:01,084
I'll see them soon enough

725
01:30:02,053 --> 01:30:03,281
What about you, kid?
You wanna  look?

726
01:30:03,302 --> 01:30:04,512
Stay away from the window, William.

727
01:30:05,030 --> 01:30:06,240
Go on take a look.

728
01:30:07,973 --> 01:30:10,697
They're animals
All of them

729
01:30:15,206 --> 01:30:17,831
They're gonna kill you and your father, William

730
01:30:20,006 --> 01:30:22,160
And I'll laugh while they do it

731
01:30:22,469 --> 01:30:23,647
I think you know that

732
01:30:24,262 --> 01:30:25,374
Call them them off

733
01:30:27,738 --> 01:30:28,686
Why should I?

734
01:30:29,433 --> 01:30:30,578
Because you're not all bad

735
01:30:35,386 --> 01:30:36,531
Yes, I am

736
01:30:37,402 --> 01:30:39,791
Your saved us from those Indians.
-I saved myself

737
01:30:40,601 --> 01:30:43,076
You got us through the tunnels
You helped us get away

738
01:30:43,450 --> 01:30:47,192
If I had a gun in them tunnels,
I would've used it on you.

739
01:30:51,738 --> 01:30:52,665
I don't believe you.

740
01:30:53,178 --> 01:30:57,968
Kid, I wouldn't last 5 minutes leading an outfit 
like that if I wasn't as rotten as hell.

741
01:31:17,849 --> 01:31:18,798
Dan, ...

742
01:31:27,834 --> 01:31:28,782
I can't do it,

743
01:31:29,178 --> 01:31:31,861
Dan, and if I can't do it, 
you shouldn't do it either

744
01:31:34,746 --> 01:31:36,568
They say discretion is the (better?) part of valor

745
01:31:36,953 --> 01:31:38,910
If you think that you have an 
olbigation to me or to the railroad...

746
01:31:39,161 --> 01:31:42,609
... I assure you you do not, I'm releasing you

747
01:31:43,098 --> 01:31:46,546
It's just you left, Dan. Just you and your boy

748
01:31:47,130 --> 01:31:50,334
Maybe he is right, Pa, 
maybe we should go home

749
01:31:57,498 --> 01:32:00,498
What did Doc Potter gave his life for, William?

750
01:32:01,714 --> 01:32:02,714
And McElroy?

751
01:32:02,812 --> 01:32:04,812
Little red ants on a hill

752
01:32:04,506 --> 01:32:08,767
I'll pay you the $200, Dan. Right now.
And you can walk away

753
01:32:13,306 --> 01:32:17,048
You know, this whole ride,
it's been nagging on me ...

754
01:32:19,545 --> 01:32:21,912
... that's what the government 
gave me for my leg ...

755
01:32:23,546 --> 01:32:26,863
... $198.36 and the funny thing is that...

756
01:32:27,865 --> 01:32:28,814
... when you think about it ...

757
01:32:29,401 --> 01:32:38,287
... -which I have been lately-
is that they weren't paying me to walk away.
They were paying me so they could walk away.

758
01:32:40,186 --> 01:32:42,161
Don't muddy the past on the present, Dan

759
01:32:42,394 --> 01:32:45,499
No, no, no, Wade. I'm seeing the world the way it is

760
01:32:46,329 --> 01:32:49,099
If you take him to the train, Pa, I'm going with you

761
01:32:49,178 --> 01:32:51,799
No, Mr. Butterfield's gonna take you home

762
01:32:52,250 --> 01:32:54,357
No, I'm not going any...
-Yes, you are

763
01:32:54,490 --> 01:32:55,802
I'm staying here with you

764
01:32:56,090 --> 01:32:59,851
You're going to hold up in the room
across the hall. You're going to wait until we leave.

765
01:33:00,346 --> 01:33:02,735
I'll get him to Bigsby.
You've got my promise

766
01:33:03,001 --> 01:33:04,630
You're going to promise a lot more than that, Butterfield

767
01:33:05,690 --> 01:33:13,109
I want guarantees that Hollander and his boys
will never set foot on my land again

768
01:33:13,497 --> 01:33:20,800
And that my water is going to flow.
And I expect you to hand my wife $1000 cash
when you see her. You've got money to spare

769
01:33:20,985 --> 01:33:24,847
I can deliver that, just get him on the train.

770
01:33:26,681 --> 01:33:28,983
You heard him?
-I heard him.

771
01:33:31,097 --> 01:33:32,439
William...

772
01:33:33,274 --> 01:33:35,575
...I want you to give this back to your mother

773
01:33:37,690 --> 01:33:43,479
I want you to tell her it helped
me find what is right

774
01:33:48,634 --> 01:33:52,976
Pa, I can't just leave you

775
01:33:53,338 --> 01:33:59,033
I'm going to be a day behind you, William
Unless something happens. And if it does,
I need a man at the ranch

776
01:33:59,993 --> 01:34:04,565
To run things; to protect our family.
And I know that you can do that because
you've become a fine man, William

777
01:34:05,849 --> 01:34:07,988
You've become a fine man
You've got all the best parts of me ...

778
01:34:09,306 --> 01:34:10,451
... what few there are

779
01:34:15,641 --> 01:34:24,126
And you just remember
that your old man hauled Ben Wade to that station 
when nobody else would

780
01:35:16,601 --> 01:35:19,487
You know, squeezing that watch won't stop time

781
01:35:26,425 --> 01:35:27,734
Don't get so scared.

782
01:35:28,153 --> 01:35:29,298
You might (pack?) a bad mood.

783
01:35:37,434 --> 01:35:38,863
Ever read the Bible, Dan?

784
01:35:41,466 --> 01:35:51,325
I read it one time. I was 8 years old. My daddy had just got 
himself killed over a shot of whiskey and my mom said we
were going back East to start over

785
01:35:52,794 --> 01:35:57,136
So she gave me a Bible, sat me down at
the train station. Told me to read it

786
01:36:00,474 --> 01:36:02,001
She was going to get our tickets

787
01:36:04,473 --> 01:36:09,524
Well, I did what she said ...
I read that Bible cover to cover.

788
01:36:09,849 --> 01:36:10,994
It took me 3 days

789
01:36:14,425 --> 01:36:15,570
She never came back.

790
01:36:41,209 --> 01:36:42,070
It's time

791
01:36:58,873 --> 01:37:01,012
It's a half mile to the station from here, Dan

792
01:37:04,857 --> 01:37:05,904
I guess we're walking

793
01:37:43,641 --> 01:37:44,590
Lucky

794
01:37:48,185 --> 01:37:48,817
Dan...

795
01:38:20,825 --> 01:38:24,029
You're not gonna get a chance
to use those Scofields, Charlie

796
01:38:25,338 --> 01:38:29,021
Perhaps you can explain to me
the next portion of your plan, Dan

797
01:38:51,481 --> 01:38:53,368
Hey!
Hey!!

798
01:38:54,041 --> 01:38:57,270
Not the black hat!

799
01:38:58,009 --> 01:39:01,114
(?) you dumb shits!

800
01:39:11,385 --> 01:39:12,214
Charlie.

801
01:39:15,801 --> 01:39:17,110
Get back!
Get back!

802
01:39:23,001 --> 01:39:23,862
Boss!

803
01:39:28,729 --> 01:39:31,729
Let's go! White Door!
Move it!

804
01:39:54,297 --> 01:39:55,475
I can't do this no more, Dan

805
01:40:01,017 --> 01:40:02,839
I'm putting you on that train, Wade

806
01:40:02,197 --> 01:40:06,967
I'm going back!
Your boy is gone, hero. Ain't nobody watching no more

807
01:40:07,641 --> 01:40:11,456
You still got that one good leg,
why don't you use it to get on home?

808
01:40:12,153 --> 01:40:13,014
Charlie!

809
01:40:14,649 --> 01:40:15,412
Charlie Prince!

810
01:40:15,801 --> 01:40:17,808
Yeah, boss!
-Hold your fire!

811
01:40:18,297 --> 01:40:19,191
I'm walking out

812
01:40:44,121 --> 01:40:46,810
I have never been no hero, Wade

813
01:40:48,921 --> 01:40:51,638
Only (action?) I've seen, it was a retreat ...

814
01:40:52,505 --> 01:40:54,807
... my foot got shot off by one of my own men.

815
01:40:56,729 --> 01:40:59,631
You try telling that story to your boy ...

816
01:41:00,409 --> 01:41:01,903
... see how he looks at you then

817
01:41:17,273 --> 01:41:18,135
Boss!

818
01:41:22,777 --> 01:41:23,890
Ok, Dan

819
01:41:34,681 --> 01:41:35,608
Son.

820
01:41:37,719 --> 01:41:40,704
They're on the move
They're on the move!

821
01:41:41,844 --> 01:41:44,913
Boss, Boss..

822
01:42:18,419 --> 01:42:19,419
Can you make this?
- Yeah

823
01:43:21,950 --> 01:43:22,737
Spread out!...

824
01:43:34,847 --> 01:43:36,806
What time is it?

825
01:43:37,246 --> 01:43:38,213
Quarter past three

826
01:43:38,781 --> 01:43:40,983
Where is the 3:10 to Yuma?

827
01:43:41,084 --> 01:43:42,043
Running late, I suppose

828
01:43:42,859 --> 01:43:43,959
How late?

829
01:43:45,135 --> 01:43:45,935
Beats me

830
01:43:45,976 --> 01:43:47,031
It gets here when it gets here

831
01:43:48,377 --> 01:43:50,583
God damned trains,
You never can rely on them, huh?

832
01:44:28,768 --> 01:44:33,900
You know...
I ain't stubborn.

833
01:44:34,701 --> 01:44:35,660
Excuse me?

834
01:44:36,908 --> 01:44:41,136
You said I was stubborn for 
keeping my family on a dying ranch

835
01:44:43,477 --> 01:44:44,777
It's my son, Mark

836
01:44:45,349 --> 01:44:46,449
The young one

837
01:44:47,168 --> 01:44:49,868
He got tuberculosis when he was 2

838
01:44:51,443 --> 01:44:54,443
Doctor said he'd die
if he didn't have a dry climate

839
01:44:54,939 --> 01:44:56,473
Why are you telling me this?

840
01:44:58,680 --> 01:44:59,639
I don't know

841
01:45:00,695 --> 01:45:04,627
I guess that I just
wanted you to know that ...

842
01:45:04,916 --> 01:45:08,752
... I ain't stubborn. That's all

843
01:45:41,528 --> 01:45:44,528
Well, as long as we're making confesions
- Yeah?

844
01:45:45,196 --> 01:45:49,320
I've been to Yuma Prison before

845
01:45:49,417 --> 01:45:52,582
Twice
Escaped twice too

846
01:46:55,592 --> 01:46:58,948
First car, sliding door

847
01:47:09,637 --> 01:47:10,737
They'll be coming

848
01:47:49,395 --> 01:47:52,478
I've got a prisoner to go to Yuma

849
01:47:57,835 --> 01:47:59,959
Well, you did it, Dan

850
01:48:01,581 --> 01:48:02,181
No!

851
