00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:52,072
- Okay.

178
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,865
- There he is.

179
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,873
- Well, I don't want him
to think I'm a freak

180
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,750
for coming to his show
the night before.

181
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:05,961
- Didn't you once tell me
that I should support you

182
00:09:06,087 --> 00:09:07,629
in everything it is
you want to do?

183
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:09,756
This is what you want to do,
so I'm supporting you.

184
00:09:09,882 --> 00:09:11,591
Okay?
- Okay.

185
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,718
- Go.
- Okay, okay, okay.

186
00:09:25,398 --> 00:09:26,982
- Grant, hey.

187
00:09:27,108 --> 00:09:29,484
- Hey.

188
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:32,737
- Where are we going?
I so need a drink.

189
00:09:32,863 --> 00:09:35,490
Oh, my God.
This woman in the first row...

190
00:09:35,616 --> 00:09:37,325
- What was that?

191
00:09:37,451 --> 00:09:39,869
- I don't-I-
I don't even know.

192
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,502
Don't you come toward me
another step, Stanley.

193
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,628
Or I'll-
- What?

194
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:53,216
- Some awful thing will happen.
It will!

195
00:09:53,342 --> 00:09:54,843
- What are you putting on now?

196
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:56,428
- I warn you.
Don't.

197
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:57,554
I'm in danger.

198
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,265
- Let's stop there, folks.

199
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,391
Grant.

200
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:12,319
Donna and Gabby,
you're up next.

201
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:15,322
- It's such an honor
to meet you.

202
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,324
I saw your play last night,
and you were brilliant.

203
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,367
- Thanks.

204
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,493
Who are you?

205
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:24,789
- Uh, Johnny.

206
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:27,042
- Do you want to act?

207
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:30,211
- I don't know.
Maybe.

208
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:34,507
- Well, you're raw, but you've
definitely got something.

209
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:37,385
Has Miss Davis forced
Stanislavsky on you yet?

210
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,845
You should try
actually reading it.

211
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:41,890
I think you'd really dig it.

212
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:46,019
- Oh, yeah, okay.
Thanks.

213
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,731
- Uh, Mr. Matson?

214
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:53,026
Could I just have a second
of your time after class?

215
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:05,705
- So you think
you want to be an actress.

216
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:08,166
Okay, well,
we could do some basic stuff,

217
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,959
movement, breath,

218
00:11:10,086 --> 00:11:12,379
your accent.

219
00:11:12,505 --> 00:11:14,047
Or we can cut the bullshit,

220
00:11:14,173 --> 00:11:15,799
and I can tell you
how it really is.

221
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,594
- Um.
- It's your call.

222
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,057
Life lessons with Grant
or teen acting class.

223
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:26,267
- Teen acting class?

224
00:11:26,394 --> 00:11:27,394
- Great.
Life lessons it is.

225
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,853
Get up here.

226
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,669
What were you doing up here?

227
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:57,382
- I was trying to show how
Blanche feels about Stanley.

228
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,759
- Uh-huh.

229
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:08,893
And what does Blanche
feel about Stanley?

230
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,395
Hm?

231
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:13,523
- Well...

232
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:15,608
I think that she's afraid.

233
00:12:15,735 --> 00:12:19,446
I think
that she feels threatened.

234
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,823
At the same time, I think that
she's also still drawn to him,

235
00:12:21,949 --> 00:12:23,116
you know?

236
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,494
It's his brute strength
versus her femininity,

237
00:12:26,620 --> 00:12:28,288
her power of seduction.

238
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:31,916
- Okay, you're smart,
so that's not the problem.

239
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:36,880
But tell me something, um...

240
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:38,715
Alexa.

241
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:42,135
Have you ever felt threatened?

242
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:43,970
- I feel a little threatened
right now.

243
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:45,513
- Oh, that's good.

244
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:50,810
But no, I meant, have you ever
been afraid of being hurt,

245
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:54,564
destroyed,
raped?

246
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,732
- No.

247
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:57,233
- You ever fucked anyone?

248
00:12:57,359 --> 00:12:59,986
- Sorry, but I don't think
that has anything to do-

249
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:03,406
- It has everything
to do with it.

250
00:13:03,532 --> 00:13:05,658
You shouldn't be playing
Blanche DuBois, honey.

251
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:07,494
You're a child.

252
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,788
Acting is not about
making up how you think

253
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:10,997
someone else feels.

254
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:13,750
It's about having
something to drawn on...

255
00:13:17,338 --> 00:13:21,090
A feeling of your own.

256
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:28,389
You ever been
hungry for anything?

257
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,892
- I don't know-
I'm not sure I know exactly-

258
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:32,268
- Hungry,

259
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:34,395
like wanting something
or needing something so badly

260
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,273
that you will do
anything to get it.

261
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:46,366
Look,
life's gonna be easy for you.

262
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,494
You're pretty.
You're smart.

263
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,996
You got it real good.

264
00:13:52,122 --> 00:13:55,500
So be a doctor
or a lawyer.

265
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:59,546
Or better still,
marry one.

266
00:14:02,091 --> 00:14:06,636
- You have no fucking idea
who I am!

267
00:14:06,762 --> 00:14:08,054
- This is what it's about,

268
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:10,390
right now, the feeling you want
to slap the shit out of me.

269
00:14:12,768 --> 00:14:14,227
- I'll learn it.

270
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:15,812
I'll start
with the Stanislavsky book.

271
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:18,690
What's the exact title?

272
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:26,447
- No book in the whole world
can teach you how to feel.

273
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,700
You got to figure
that shit out for yourself.

274
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,410
- Well, if you
recommended it to Johnny

275
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,662
and some mindless asshole
with a God complex can learn it,

276
00:14:32,788 --> 00:14:33,830
trust me, I can.

277
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:36,332
- Is that really
all you can see?

278
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:39,085
Let's forget about the scene
and just worry about you.

279
00:14:39,211 --> 00:14:41,212
Shake it up a bit.

280
00:14:41,338 --> 00:14:46,009
Do something
you're afraid of and fail.

281
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:50,471
And after all that...

282
00:14:50,598 --> 00:14:54,684
if you still
want to be an actress,

283
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,436
God bless you.

284
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,525
Class dismissed.

285
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:09,240
[knocking on door]

286
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:10,491
- [clears throat]
- Alexa?

287
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:12,368
- Yeah?

288
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,536
- Honey, can I come in?

289
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:14,954
- Yeah, sure, come on.

290
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,289
Come on in.

291
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,089
- Sweetie, are you sick?
You look sick.

292
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,091
- No, just tired.

293
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,302
What's up?

294
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,803
- Oh, I was just,
you know,

295
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:33,056
going through my makeup
clearing stuff out,

296
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:36,976
old nail polishes and stuff.

297
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:38,144
I was gonna give it to Marva,

298
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,605
but I thought you might
like to take a look.

299
00:15:40,731 --> 00:15:43,483
- Sure, yeah.

300
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,735
- Are you sure you're okay?

301
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:46,945
- Yeah.

302
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:51,783
- Oh, I thought this
was a good color for you.

303
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,704
- It's pretty.
- Pretty, huh?

304
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,831
Delicate,
don't you think?

305
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:08,633
Well, I'll let you
get back to work.

306
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:10,510
Okay.
- Thanks, Mom.

307
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:12,220
- Night.

308
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:18,101
Do you want me to give you
something to help you sleep?

309
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,228
- No, thanks.

310
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,063
- I have to meet
my trainer early in the morning,

311
00:16:22,189 --> 00:16:24,273
so I'll see you at dinner.

312
00:17:09,153 --> 00:17:10,528
Alexa?

313
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:13,031
Are you sick?
It's 11:30.

314
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,713
- Hey, where the hell
were you this morning?

315
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,506
- I took a mental health day.

316
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,674
- It's not even lunch.

317
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,217
You mean you took
a mental health morning?

318
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:34,343
You're hilarious.

319
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,511
Sweetie...

320
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:37,263
what is this sweater
you're wearing?

321
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:38,598
I mean...

322
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:40,224
get dressed in the dark
or something?

323
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,101
- I don't need this shit
from you right now, okay?

324
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,770
So please back off.

325
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,605
- Okay.

326
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:51,027
Clearly, you're on some sort of,
like, psychotic trip right now.

327
00:17:51,153 --> 00:17:54,197
So I'm just gonna pretend
that never happened.

328
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,449
I'll call you tomorrow
and tell you how the party went.

329
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,452
Nice hoodie, Ben.
Cute.

330
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:00,578
- Hey.

331
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:01,954
Are you hanging out tonight?

332
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,206
- Yeah.

333
00:18:03,332 --> 00:18:05,917
- Wow, don't sound so stoked
about it, okay?

334
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:09,253
- Sorry.
I'm just out of it.

335
00:18:09,379 --> 00:18:12,006
- What was Courtney
flapping about?

336
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:14,550
- Some party
at Johnny's tonight.

337
00:18:14,676 --> 00:18:17,386
- So freaking status quo.

338
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:20,139
So you want
to see a movie later or dinner?

339
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,933
- I got to go.

340
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:23,768
- What?

341
00:18:41,453 --> 00:18:44,664
- Damn, your ass looks sweet
in those jeans.

342
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:47,416
- Josh, what are you doing here?

343
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,210
Don't get me in trouble.

344
00:18:49,336 --> 00:18:50,753
I already have
enough shit to deal with.

345
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:51,879
- Oh, yeah?

346
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:53,339
I'll give you
something to deal with.

347
00:18:53,465 --> 00:18:54,465
Come here.

348
00:18:54,591 --> 00:18:55,842
- [giggles]

349
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:57,343
Josh!

350
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,594
- You like that?

351
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,680
- Yeah.
- You like that?

352
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,516
- [giggles]

353
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:07,478

00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:37,055
Do you
know anything about it?

536
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,390
- No.

537
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:40,517
- In a way,
it's kind of a relief.

538
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:42,185
- Wait, what do you mean?

539
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:44,396
- Every parent wants their kid
to veer from the rules

540
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:45,731
once in a while.

541
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:46,898
It's a sign of normalcy.

542
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:48,233
- So being a whore
is normal?

543
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,359
- Ben!

544
00:33:49,485 --> 00:33:51,194
Why are you being
so judgmental?

545
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:52,946
- Mom, please.

546
00:33:53,072 --> 00:33:55,365
- Listen, Deirdre and Doug
are going out of town,

547
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:57,492
and they don't feel comfortable
leaving Alexa alone.

548
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:01,079
Deirdre's completely freaked out
and overreacting, as per usual.

549
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,748
So Alexa's staying with us.

550
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:03,999
- What?

551
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,001
Wait, why didn't you
ask me first?

552
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,919
- Because it's not
your decision to make, Ben,

553
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,546
and because
she's your oldest friend.

554
00:34:09,672 --> 00:34:10,839
Why is it an issue?

555
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:12,966
- I just don't see why
I should have to suffer

556
00:34:13,092 --> 00:34:14,593
because she can't
control herself.

557
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:16,428
- You're in high school
for Christ's sake.

558
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:17,721
It's normal.

559
00:34:26,189 --> 00:34:27,731
- I'm gonna shower.

560
00:34:28,941 --> 00:34:30,525
- Do you want me
to make you something to eat?

561
00:34:30,651 --> 00:34:32,778
- No, I'm going out.

562
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:34,362
- Morning.

563
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:41,953
- Fuck.

564
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:43,121
- Fuck?

565
00:34:43,247 --> 00:34:45,540
- Yes.

566
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:47,209
- Okay.

567
00:35:04,602 --> 00:35:06,144
- Stay here.

568
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,813
It's one cookie
or one muffin.

569
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:08,980
One thing...

570
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:13,944
[children whining]

571
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,160
- You know, I just-I never
want that to be my life.

572
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,954
- Yeah.

573
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:38,051
Edith Wharton?

574
00:35:38,177 --> 00:35:40,303
School or pleasure?

575
00:35:40,429 --> 00:35:41,638
- Oh, school...

576
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:44,474
or pleasure.

577
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,852
School,
but I also really like it.

578
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,396
- Yeah, me too,
a lot.

579
00:35:49,522 --> 00:35:51,022
I'm Nick.

580
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:52,566
- Ben.

581
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,317
- Nice to meet you, Ben.

582
00:35:54,443 --> 00:35:56,194
Definitely seen you around.

583
00:35:56,320 --> 00:36:00,866
I'm working a lot here,
so we should hang out sometime.

584
00:36:00,992 --> 00:36:03,076
I could use
a study partner.

585
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:06,454
- Yeah, yeah.

586
00:36:06,581 --> 00:36:09,249
Uh...

587
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:11,626
Yeah, I got to go.

588
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,211
But it was nice to meet you.

589
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:15,213
I'll see you.

590
00:36:55,254 --> 00:36:58,256
Hey.

591
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,091
What are you doing out here?

592
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,636
- What are you,
my social conscience?

593
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:04,721
- You know, if you're
just gonna be a bitch...

594
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:08,516
- Oh, Jesus,
don't be so sensitive.

595
00:37:08,643 --> 00:37:10,894
Come on.
Sit down, Benjamin.

596
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,784
Can't believe I don't have
anything better to do

597
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,829
than to watch Johnny and Alexa
pretend to have sex.

598
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:32,207
It's tragic.

599
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,959
- Yeah, well...

600
00:37:34,085 --> 00:37:37,128
Alexa has nothing better to do
than pretend, period.

601
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,505
- [chortles]

602
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,257
- It's not like
it means anything.

603
00:37:40,383 --> 00:37:43,343
- I mean,
she's really lost her mind.

604
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,511
I guess that's what happens

605
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:46,680
when you discover
the power of a dick.

606
00:37:49,725 --> 00:37:51,226
- Okay.

607
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:59,651
- God, this is
what it must feel like

608
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:04,155
in drama crew
Loserville.

609
00:38:04,282 --> 00:38:06,157
No offense, Ben.

610
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:08,285
- None taken,
you chain-smoking slut.

611
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:19,879
- Hey.

612
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:22,465
Don't tell Alexa I said
any of this shit, okay?

613
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:25,719
- All right.

614
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:32,684
Hey, you want to watch
from the lighting booth?

615
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:35,103
Might as well
be queen of the losers.

616
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:56,041
- I kind of just want
to sleep tonight.

617
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:58,460
- We can do that.

618
00:39:01,756 --> 00:39:04,215
- I got in trouble.

619
00:39:04,342 --> 00:39:05,383
My parents are freaked.

620
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,887
I mean, I've never...

621
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:10,013
They're just mad.

622
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:12,265
- So?

623
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:14,768
- So I should
probably just go to Ben's

624
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,854
and be good tonight.

625
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,647
- Well, what about me?

626
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,191
- What do you mean?

627
00:39:24,111 --> 00:39:25,362
- Forget it.
Never mind.

628
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,238
- Couldn't we
just talk tomorrow?

629
00:39:27,365 --> 00:39:28,573
Okay?
I'm just tired.

630
00:39:28,699 --> 00:39:29,908
- Mm-hmm.

631
00:39:33,037 --> 00:39:34,871
- And you might want
to go over your script,

632
00:39:34,997 --> 00:39:36,581
'cause you
missed a line tonight.

633
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,669
You headed home, Ben?

634
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,342
Forget it.

635
00:39:47,468 --> 00:39:49,969
Courtney, would you please
drive me to Ben's house?

636
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,473
- Night, Ben.

637
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:54,599
I had fun.

638
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:55,934
- Yes, good night, Ben.

639
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,143
I'll be in the guest room

640
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,979
if you decide
you want to be human again.

641
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:12,534
- Hey.

642
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,120
Um...

643
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,579
You need a ride?

644
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:37,100
This is really expensive.

645
00:40:37,226 --> 00:40:39,644
- Yeah, there's a whole case
of that shit right there.

646
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:52,949
Drop the bottle.
Drop it.

647
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:55,660
We've had this date with
each other since the beginning.

648
00:40:55,786 --> 00:40:58,705
- What?

649
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:01,541
- It's the line
I forgot tonight.

650
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,586
If you still need
to take a piss, just go ahead.

651
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,216
[cork pops]

652
00:41:15,097 --> 00:41:17,015
- I always wondered
what it felt like to do that.

653
00:41:30,988 --> 00:41:32,864
I guess we might as well
finish the bottle, huh?

654
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:36,784
- You're a funny kid.

655
00:41:36,911 --> 00:41:39,954
[chuckles]

656
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,873
Yeah, I guess you might as well
bring it over here.

657
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:43,541
I might jump in anyway.

658
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:05,271
I can't believe
that's your first cigarette.

659
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,774
I'm totally corrupting you.

660
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:12,612
- [coughing]

661
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:13,780
It's kind of cool.

662
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:17,700
[coughs]

663
00:42:19,453 --> 00:42:22,830
- Hey, I wonder
if Alexa would come over.

664
00:42:22,957 --> 00:42:24,415
You think
I should call her?

665
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,793
- Alexa wants
to be alone tonight.

666
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,921
- How do you know?

667
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,756
- Well, she's my friend.

668
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,634
- Yeah, your only one.

669
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:38,888
Why is she
friends with you anyway?

670
00:42:39,014 --> 00:42:41,724
- I've known her
since I was little.

671
00:42:47,273 --> 00:42:49,190
Have you ever even hooked up
with anyone at school

672
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:52,151
other than her?

673
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:55,488
- [laughs]

674
00:42:55,614 --> 00:42:59,033
- What?
Just, I...

675
00:42:59,159 --> 00:43:00,577
I don't know.
I hear you're all talk.

676
00:43:00,703 --> 00:43:02,954
- From who?

677
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,872
Nobody talks to you.

678
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:12,672
Just 'cause I don't want to date
some skanky rich girl.

679
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:14,382
Maybe I'm just sensitive.

680
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:16,259
- [scoffs]

681
00:43:16,385 --> 00:43:17,719
- And fuck you, man.
You don't know me.

682
00:43:17,845 --> 00:43:19,012
- Yeah?
You don't know me either.

683
00:43:19,138 --> 00:43:20,930
- All right, well,
you can blow me, light boy.

684
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:27,270
- Whip it out.

685
00:43:31,942 --> 00:43:34,068
- I'm not a fag, man.

686
00:43:34,194 --> 00:43:37,572
- Whatever.
I'm not the sensitive one.

687
00:43:37,698 --> 00:43:41,951
- When did you
turn into evil light boy?

688
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:44,579
- When you turned out
to be a total poseur.

689
00:43:44,705 --> 00:43:48,708
- Dude...

690
00:43:48,834 --> 00:43:50,543
Who the hell are you?

691
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:55,882
- You gonna do it or not?

692
00:43:58,344 --> 00:44:01,012
- You really want it,
don't you?

693
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,056
- Maybe you want it
and you're scared to admit it.

694
00:44:03,182 --> 00:44:06,768
- I'm not scared.

695
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:07,894
- So?

696
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,613
- I don't want anything.

697
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,990
[water splashes]

698
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:25,912
- I've never kissed anybody.

699
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:31,209
- I'm about to fucking
graduate high school, man,

700
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:33,586
and I've never kissed
a single person.

701
00:44:33,712 --> 00:44:35,880
- Are you serious?

702
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,967
- Yeah.

703
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,013
- Come here.

704
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:04,951
How's that?

705
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,495
[chuckles]

706
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:08,788
Whoa.

707
00:45:08,914 --> 00:45:12,500
- Sorry.

708
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:14,711
It's just,
you're fucking amazing.

709
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,401
- Whoa.

710
00:45:38,527 --> 00:45:40,236
W-w-w-whoa, whoa, there.

711
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:14,687
What are you doing?

712
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:17,440
- I don't know.

713
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,484
- Dude, wait.

714
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:46,052

00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:17,201
I'll make it really quick,
and you can take it with you.

901
00:58:17,327 --> 00:58:18,911
- Okay.

902
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:24,291
Um, is Ben coming down soon?

903
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:26,502
- It's still a little early.

904
00:58:26,628 --> 00:58:29,379
- Oh.

905
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:30,839
Is the train station
near here?

906
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:32,799
- Oh, you don't have a car.

907
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:33,967
Well, I'll drive you, then.

908
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:35,302
- Oh, no,
you don't have to do that.

909
00:58:35,428 --> 00:58:37,429
- Oh, Johnny,
it's not a problem.

910
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:39,389
I'm a mother.
We're prepared for these things.

911
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:41,391
I'll finish up your bagel,
and I'll swing you over.

912
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:42,684
Where's the office?

913
00:58:42,810 --> 00:58:44,186
- Haverford,
off of Montgomery.

914
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:45,562
- Not a problem.

915
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:46,772
We'll leave in one minute.

916
00:58:58,201 --> 00:58:59,701
Ready?

917
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:09,461
So, Johnny,
where do you live?

918
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:10,587
- Gladwyne.

919
00:59:10,713 --> 00:59:13,632
- Has your family
lived there long?

920
00:59:13,758 --> 00:59:15,676
- It's just my dad
and my stepmom.

921
00:59:15,802 --> 00:59:18,303
- I see.

922
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:23,600
And your mom?

923
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:27,104
- What about her?

924
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,773
- Did she...

925
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:31,441
Did she pass?

926
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:32,609
- No, she's alive.

927
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,736
I just
don't see her anymore.

928
00:59:34,862 --> 00:59:37,239
- I'm sorry.

929
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:39,449
- It's right up there
on the left.

930
00:59:47,250 --> 00:59:49,126
- When did they divorce?

931
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:52,296
- When I was two.

932
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,590
- That's very difficult.

933
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:09,938
- I got to go.

934
01:00:10,064 --> 01:00:11,732
- Who's your doctor?

935
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:18,614
- Dr. Mohr.

936
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:19,990
You're a therapist,
aren't you?

937
01:00:20,116 --> 01:00:22,701
- Yeah.

938
01:00:22,827 --> 01:00:24,453
Serena Mohr
is very good.

939
01:00:24,579 --> 01:00:26,538
- Yeah, my dad said
she's the best.

940
01:00:29,375 --> 01:00:30,417
Hey, thanks for the ride.

941
01:00:30,543 --> 01:00:32,586
- Oh, of course.

942
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,254
Please.

943
01:00:41,888 --> 01:00:44,890
- Um, okay, bye.

944
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:54,149
I think I made a new friend.

945
01:00:54,275 --> 01:00:56,068
- Well, tell me about him.

946
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:57,527
Her?

947
01:00:57,654 --> 01:00:59,154
- Him.

948
01:01:01,324 --> 01:01:02,658
His name's Ben.

949
01:01:02,784 --> 01:01:04,910
He's kind of a loser at school,
but he gave me a ride home,

950
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:06,620
and we made out
in my pool.

951
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,875
I'm not gay or anything.

952
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:16,713
It's just, he was
looking at me in this way.

953
01:01:20,218 --> 01:01:22,719
So I let him kiss me.

954
01:01:22,845 --> 01:01:25,514
- What do you mean,
looking at you in this way?

955
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,182
- I don't know.
It was like...

956
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:28,975
It was like
he wasn’t just looking at me,

957
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:32,562
but he was...

958
01:01:32,689 --> 01:01:34,690
seeing something in me.

959
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,069
Does that sound weird?

960
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,071
- No.

961
01:01:41,197 --> 01:01:43,365
How'd that make you feel?

962
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:45,534
- It felt good.

963
01:01:48,037 --> 01:01:49,329
And...

964
01:01:49,455 --> 01:01:50,914
Like, I could just feel-

965
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:54,376
I just knew
that he needed me to hug him.

966
01:01:56,879 --> 01:01:58,130
So I did.

967
01:01:58,256 --> 01:02:00,340
- Mm-hmm.

968
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:02,175
- And that...

969
01:02:02,301 --> 01:02:05,220
like, felt cool;
I don't know.

970
01:02:05,346 --> 01:02:11,017
It's, like...
It was, like, calm or something.

971
01:02:11,144 --> 01:02:13,061
- And then what happened?

972
01:02:16,065 --> 01:02:17,941
- He said I was amazing.

973
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:20,736
Whatever.

974
01:02:20,862 --> 01:02:23,196
- Why "whatever"?

975
01:02:23,322 --> 01:02:26,283
- It's funny, 'cause...

976
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:29,369
it never would've happened if
Alexa hadn't been such a bitch

977
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:32,164
and blown me off.

978
01:02:32,290 --> 01:02:33,790
She said
that she couldn't deal with me

979
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:35,542
and she needed
to be alone.

980
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:38,170
- That doesn't sound like
she's totally blown you off.

981
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:40,505
I mean...

982
01:02:40,631 --> 01:02:43,717
everybody feels like they need
to be alone sometimes, right?

983
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:45,552
- I feel like I'm alone
all fucking day,

984
01:02:45,678 --> 01:02:47,596
at school, at home, in here.

985
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:52,517
It just felt nice...

986
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:54,895
to not feel alone,
you know?

987
01:02:56,355 --> 01:02:59,357
- I do.

988
01:03:02,153 --> 01:03:06,448
- Anyway, they're best friends,
Alexa and Ben.

989
01:03:06,574 --> 01:03:09,159
It's just cool
the way they are together.

990
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:17,125
It just felt good
to be looked at that way.

991
01:03:17,251 --> 01:03:18,376
- What do you think he meant

992
01:03:18,503 --> 01:03:21,963
when he said
he thought you were amazing?

993
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:27,093
- Probably all bullshit,
right?

994
01:03:27,220 --> 01:03:29,387
They're both just using me,
blah, blah, blah.

995
01:03:29,514 --> 01:03:30,597
Is that what you're saying?

996
01:03:30,723 --> 01:03:31,765
- Not at all, Johnny.

997
01:03:31,891 --> 01:03:34,100
I'm asking you
what you think.

998
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:48,782
- I slept really well last night
for the first time...

999
01:03:48,908 --> 01:03:50,617
in a while,

1000
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:53,703
at Ben's house.

1001
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,164
The three of us just hung out,
me, Ben, Alexa.

1002
01:03:56,290 --> 01:03:59,209
We watched TV
with his parents.

1003
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:01,878
- And you've been sexual
with both of them?

1004
01:04:07,385 --> 01:04:08,593
- Yeah, so?

1005
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:12,556
- Well, you refer to them
as your friends.

1006
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:14,850
Is that how they see you,
as a friend?

1007
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:17,394
Or do you think they
want something more from you?

1008
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:19,396
- Listen,
nothing happened, okay?

1009
01:04:19,522 --> 01:04:21,147
I just...

1010
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:22,774
We watched TV.
I fell asleep.

1011
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,109
They left me alone.

1012
01:04:24,235 --> 01:04:25,735
And now
I actually feel kind of good,

1013
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,487
and you're trying to make it
all fucked up.

1014
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:29,865
- I'm not trying to make it
all fucked up.

1015
01:04:29,991 --> 01:04:31,616
I'm just saying,
things can get confusing

1016
01:04:31,742 --> 01:04:33,326
when you're trying
to get on the same page

1017
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:34,870
as the people
you care about.

1018
01:04:34,996 --> 01:04:37,414
- So I'm not worth
just being someone's friend

1019
01:04:37,540 --> 01:04:40,709
because I'm a piece of shit,
and they're both just using me?

1020
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:42,711
- No, I just think, you know,
it would be helpful

1021
01:04:42,837 --> 01:04:44,880
to look at the whole picture.

1022
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:48,091
- This is bullshit.

1023
01:04:48,217 --> 01:04:50,218
You're always telling me
that I don't let anyone in.

1024
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:52,220
So you should be cheering
because your mind fuck

1025
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:53,722
is finally paying off.

1026
01:05:17,038 --> 01:05:18,663
[horn honks]

1027
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:20,540
- Yo, J.

1028
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:22,876
Get in.

1029
01:05:32,386 --> 01:05:34,220
Why were you walking?
- No car.

1030
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:36,264
- You walk
all the way from your house?

1031
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:38,391
- Nah, dude,
I had a doctor's appointment.

1032
01:05:38,517 --> 01:05:40,560
- Cool.
You sick or something?

1033
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:42,771
- Kind of, yeah.

1034
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:44,230
- Dude, that sucks.

1035
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:51,321
- Where's your bag?

1036
01:05:51,447 --> 01:05:53,657
- I didn't
stay at home last night.

1037
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:55,700
- So what's it like
fucking Alexa Walker, huh?

1038
01:05:55,826 --> 01:05:57,494
I mean, you're the first
to hit that, right?

1039
01:05:57,620 --> 01:05:58,912
- Don't be such an asshole, man.

1040
01:05:59,038 --> 01:06:00,038
- What's the big deal?

1041
01:06:00,164 --> 01:06:01,581
We talk about this shit
all the time.

1042
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:03,291
- Yeah, when we were freshmen.

1043
01:06:03,417 --> 01:06:06,294
- So did you stay at Alexa's
last night or what?

1044
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:11,383
- No, I stayed at Ben's.

1045
01:06:11,509 --> 01:06:14,094
- Ben Berger?
- Yeah.

1046
01:06:14,220 --> 01:06:15,762
- You're kidding me, right?

1047
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:17,389
- No.
- Dude, come on.

1048
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:19,349
He's a total faggot.

1049
01:06:19,475 --> 01:06:21,518
- Don't use that word.
It's offensive.

1050
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:25,271
- Okay, sorry.

1051
01:06:28,150 --> 01:06:29,401
Whatever.

1052
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:33,071
Ben Berger
is a complete loser.

1053
01:06:33,197 --> 01:06:34,948
- You ever think
that maybe you're the loser?

1054
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:36,700
- What?

1055
01:06:36,826 --> 01:06:37,826
- Seriously, man.

1056
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:39,703
I mean,
who the fuck are you?

1057
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:42,122
It's senior year.
You're still on JV soccer.

1058
01:06:42,248 --> 01:06:43,623
You're
an average student at best.

1059
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:46,292
And you lost your virginity
to the class slut.

1060
01:06:46,419 --> 01:06:48,294
- No, man,
Gabby's cool now.

1061
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:50,213
- You're nothing.

1062
01:06:50,339 --> 01:06:51,423
You're nobody.

1063
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:53,299
You're just gonna end up
at some huge school,

1064
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:54,509
join a frat,

1065
01:06:54,635 --> 01:06:56,803
and blend in with the rest
of the useless motherfuckers.

1066
01:06:56,929 --> 01:06:59,806
- You're a fag too,
aren't you?

1067
01:06:59,932 --> 01:07:01,850
- If you ever fucking
use that word to me again,

1068
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:03,768
I'm gonna tell Gabby
about the time you dared me

1069
01:07:03,894 --> 01:07:06,062
to rub my hard-on
against yours in eighth grade.

1070
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:20,618
Thanks for the ride.

1071
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:21,786
- Oh, yeah?

1072
01:07:21,912 --> 01:07:23,788
Oh, yeah?
Fuck you too, man!

1073
01:07:23,914 --> 01:07:26,124
Fuck you!
- What was that?

1074
