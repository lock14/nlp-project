Paris 2010.

3
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:24,680
In connection with a dramatic increase
in crime in certain neighbourhoods.

4
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,080
The government is implementing a new policy...

5
00:00:28,280 --> 00:00:31,960
...isolating the high risk areas with walls - a modern day ghetto.

Borough 13

8
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:08,840
- Thats it. I need more.
- Chill bro, it ain't ready yet.

9
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,160
OK, done. Take it.

10
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,960
Alright ladies, did I frighten you?

11
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,160
You didn't even notice
man's pullin up.

12
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,760
- Don't get smart mate.
- Relax, be cool.

13
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,240
This is a random visit.

14
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,760
Mmm... smells wicked.
Gourmet shit?

15
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,360
Tasty.

16
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,560
You want?

17
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,160
So where's your Boss at?

18
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,960
- He ain't about.
- Cool. I'll hang loose then, OK?

19
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:31,360
Easy now fellas, I ain't packin'.
Weaponless, get me?

20
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,560
Fuck off K2, trust me I will.

21
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,160
What's up with you guys?

22
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,360
It ain't like I come to visit everyday,
And this is the way you treat me?

23
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:42,760
Go away K2, there isn't time to get friendly.
Come back later.

24
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,960
When the boss gets back,
I'll let him know you came by.

25
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:50,560
Alright boys. You got a piece of paper
so I can leave him my number?

26
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,960
No? I'll write it on the wall,
It won't go missing.

27
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:58,960
- The wall is off limits.
- I totally forgot, property of the owner.

28
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,360
He lives like a real gangster.

29
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:03,960
And you're just jealous
that it ain't your yard.

30
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:07,160
Fuck off.
I spit on this shit-hole.

31
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,560
So where the fuck can I leave my number?

32
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:13,160
Gimme your hand.

33
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,720
Don't get scared! If I wanted to kill you,
I would've done it a long time ago.

34
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,320
Armed to the teeth,
an scared of a pen.

35
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,120
Chill; relax.
I don't bite.

36
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:25,360
What do you want from Leito?

37
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,720
He's got my things.
I just came to collect them.

38
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,320
You best not wash for awhile, alright?

39
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,320
This is pleasant & friendly ain't it?
A handshake goes a long way, bro.

40
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,120
- What do they call you?
- Tarik.

41
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,720
Gimme some skin.
Like an oath.

42
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:52,560
Shame, if you had a camera,
we could've had a picture.

43
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,360
- Cut it out!
- Smile, watch.

44
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,720
Don't worry, they're with me.

45
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,960
Now you fucking wanna talk, yeah?
Well it's a bit late.

46
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,200
You, stairs. I got the lift.

47
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:23,800
I like fast rides.

48
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,120
Come here.

49
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:31,960
You free for a minute?

50
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:52,960
It was terrible, why did I wait...?

51
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,960
- Yo, the lift's moving. Radio them.
- You do it.

52
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,960
Tarik, who's that coming in the lift?

53
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,360
Tarik! Shit it's fucked again.

54
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,760
- What do we do?
- Don't stress, man! This film is wicked.

55
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:13,160
Tarik, what the fuck is going on?

56
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,360
Tarik!

57
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,560
Arghh not now.
Fix the aerial.

58
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,760
I ain't your bitch!
Fix it yourself, you lazy dumb fuck!

59
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,960
Tarik, can you hear me?

60
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,760
Why are you so stressed?
He's probably bringing us our dinner.

61
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,360
Dinner, an hour early?
Something ain't right.

62
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,560
Well I'm not a pessimist like you.

63
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,440
We're looking for Leito,
What number is he at?

64
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,760
- 14.
- Cheers.

65
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:16,040
Shit, the doors aren't numbered!

66
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,160
Bust all the doors down.

67
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,960
- Where is Leito?
- Well he ain't here.

68
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:35,560
- I know that, but fuckin where?
- Along the corridor, last door on the left.

69
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,760
You're coming with me, so I don't get lost.

70
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,160
Turn right!

71
00:07:48,760 --> 00:07:49,960
Right.

72
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,760
Third door.

73
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,640
Do you wish me dead?
I want him alive.

74
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,360
Is that clear to you all?

75
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,240
Move.

76
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,960
On three, yeah?

77
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,760
1, 2, 3.

78
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,440
Grab him!

79
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,720
Shoot!

80
00:08:46,520 --> 00:08:47,360
He's at the bottom.

81
00:09:17,961 --> 00:09:19,361
He's on the roof.

82
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:24,761
Motherfucker.

83
00:09:30,961 --> 00:09:32,121
There he his!

84
00:10:53,721 --> 00:10:54,561
Fuck!

85
00:11:13,361 --> 00:11:16,961
Let's think...
At 8:00 he stole 20kg of heroin from you.

86
00:11:17,001 --> 00:11:20,601
You found out who did it at 9.00...
How many of you went to pay him a visit?

87
00:11:20,601 --> 00:11:22,401
- 12 guys.
- 12?

88
00:11:22,601 --> 00:11:25,001
And you all came back empty handed?

89
00:11:25,201 --> 00:11:28,081
- That's cool?
- We could've killed him about 100 times.

90
00:11:28,201 --> 00:11:31,401
- But you want him alive.
- Are you saying its now somehow my fault?

91
00:11:31,401 --> 00:11:34,601
Nah, I'm not trying to say that.
It's just that he's so...

92
00:11:34,601 --> 00:11:37,001
...slippery. Soap bar.
- Slippery, like a soap bar?

93
00:11:38,201 --> 00:11:38,881
Yeah.

94
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:43,801
€50 for a gram, times 20 kilos.
That's a million euro.

95
00:11:44,801 --> 00:11:46,401
That's one expensive soap bar.

96
00:11:48,401 --> 00:11:51,601
Well then.
I'm waiting for your proposal?

97
00:11:52,001 --> 00:11:53,401
Has anyone got a proposal?

98
00:12:02,401 --> 00:12:03,001
No, no need!

99
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:06,201
I've got a proposal.

100
00:12:06,201 --> 00:12:08,801
K2, fantastic!
I'm all ears.

101
00:12:09,201 --> 00:12:12,721
Well Leito stole our drugs so...
he's gotta pay, right?

102
00:12:12,721 --> 00:12:16,201
That is not a proposition,
merely stating the obvious.

103
00:12:16,201 --> 00:12:17,601
- Hold on, Wait!
- I'm waiting!

104
00:12:18,801 --> 00:12:22,401
His sister, Lola, she works
in a nearby supermarket.

105
00:12:23,001 --> 00:12:25,601
We grab her and he comes to us.

106
00:12:27,001 --> 00:12:29,401
You see that? That's a good proposal.
Bring her here.

107
00:12:43,001 --> 00:12:44,201
Back in a minute.

108
00:13:01,601 --> 00:13:03,281
Come on, the manager wants you.

109
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:06,401
Let's go, are you deaf?
They are calling you.

110
00:13:06,401 --> 00:13:09,001
- The boss isn't in on a Wednesday.
- What has the boss got to do with this?

111
00:13:09,001 --> 00:13:10,801
My boss is waiting for you, Taha.

112
00:13:11,001 --> 00:13:13,001
Taha is not my boss.

113
00:13:14,801 --> 00:13:16,601
Let go, bastard.

114
00:13:18,801 --> 00:13:20,601
You big animal.

115
00:13:28,601 --> 00:13:29,401
Move bitch.

116
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:33,401
- Oh, a present?
- I can take care of her, we can make it work.

117
00:14:34,601 --> 00:14:37,201
- Hands off!
- Can I search her?

118
00:14:37,201 --> 00:14:40,401
- I already did, she's clean.
- Let me take a peek at her panties.

119
00:14:40,601 --> 00:14:42,601
I'll stuff them down your throat!

120
00:14:42,601 --> 00:14:45,401
If you want too,
I'm getting excited.

121
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,481
Here's a taste.

122
00:14:48,201 --> 00:14:50,601
Fuck off man,
Taha is waiting for her.

123
00:14:51,001 --> 00:14:52,681
Stop struggling,
you'll hurt yourself.

124
00:15:04,801 --> 00:15:05,681
It's me.

125
00:15:05,801 --> 00:15:08,281
This is a very easy gadget to use.
Let me show you.

126
00:15:09,201 --> 00:15:11,801
- I will demonstrate in a second...
- K2 at the door.

127
00:15:11,801 --> 00:15:14,081
...it's use.
It's very flexible...

128
00:15:15,001 --> 00:15:17,001
He's come back with more excuses?

129
00:15:19,201 --> 00:15:20,601
You can come in.

130
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:24,001
Inform Leito
that I got his sister.

131
00:15:25,801 --> 00:15:28,601
I'd like to see his face
when he finds out.

132
00:15:31,001 --> 00:15:35,401
Well here it is.
Trust me, I'll put an end to your plans!

133
00:15:35,401 --> 00:15:39,801
If anything happens to me,
your situation is not gonna get better.

134
00:15:39,801 --> 00:15:40,801
What do you want?

135
00:15:40,801 --> 00:15:44,321
Do you know what makes us different?
You don't know what I'm thinking.

136
00:15:44,321 --> 00:15:47,801
And me, I know your every move.
That's why I'm always one step ahead.

137
00:15:49,601 --> 00:15:53,601
Relax, K2, it's cool.
Just chatting, calm down.

138
00:15:53,601 --> 00:15:54,681
We got a lot to chat about.

139
00:15:55,001 --> 00:15:58,481
You can stop stroking my hair.
Just let me know what you want!

140
00:15:58,481 --> 00:16:00,601
- Two things.
- I'm listening.

141
00:16:00,601 --> 00:16:03,401
Your people will not come
within a half kilometre of my house.

142
00:16:05,201 --> 00:16:07,081
Deal. And the second?

143
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:09,601
Your life for the life of my sister.

144
00:16:10,801 --> 00:16:13,801
I let you go and we both walk.
Your men stay here.

145
00:16:13,801 --> 00:16:16,081
- You're a businessman, right?
- Talk!

146
00:16:16,201 --> 00:16:18,801
- All right, I've got nothing against.
- You give your word?

147
00:16:19,201 --> 00:16:21,681
- That's right?
- For the moment.

148
00:16:21,801 --> 00:16:23,201
K2, let her go.

149
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:27,401
Do it, don't think about it!

150
00:16:28,601 --> 00:16:30,481
Are you gonna lie down,
or do you need help?

151
00:16:37,001 --> 00:16:39,601
OK, I kept my word. She's free.

152
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:41,401
- Put the knife down.
- Don't worry.

153
00:16:45,601 --> 00:16:47,441
Do you think you're gonna
get out of here with me?

154
00:16:47,441 --> 00:16:49,281
What makes you think
that everybody here likes you?

155
00:16:51,001 --> 00:16:53,321
Listen up, boys. We've finished talking.

156
00:16:53,321 --> 00:16:55,801
They are leaving and nobody else leaves.

157
00:16:55,801 --> 00:16:58,281
Don't try and shoot.
I'll be right back.

158
00:17:11,561 --> 00:17:12,401
Wait!

159
00:17:21,961 --> 00:17:23,361
Open your mouth.

160
00:17:27,961 --> 00:17:29,561
Now chew.

161
00:17:30,761 --> 00:17:32,441
I like your sister's style.

162
00:17:32,601 --> 00:17:33,841
Shut the fuck up, and move.

163
00:18:32,762 --> 00:18:33,802
Gimme it, take it.

164
00:18:47,362 --> 00:18:50,362
Easy, don't shoot.
We're gonna deliver our client.

165
00:18:53,602 --> 00:18:55,202
Call the Chief!

166
00:18:59,002 --> 00:19:00,842
Let us pass, before it's too late.

167
00:19:17,002 --> 00:19:18,402
Shit.

168
00:19:19,562 --> 00:19:22,602
Can't you two talk things over?
We are slowly packing up.

169
00:19:22,602 --> 00:19:25,402
This is Taha. Taha Bemamud.
He's got a thousand warrants out for him.

170
00:19:25,402 --> 00:19:27,562
I know him well,
but we are still leaving.

171
00:19:27,562 --> 00:19:30,842
Orders from the Ministry.
Plus I need solid evidence.

172
00:19:32,722 --> 00:19:36,042
5 kilos of heroin from his office
and 2 witnesses should be enough!

173
00:19:49,362 --> 00:19:52,362
Chief, there are too many of them.
They are three times stronger then our forces.

174
00:19:54,922 --> 00:19:58,922
All right, we will take this to court.
You can hand in your weapons now.

175
00:19:58,922 --> 00:20:00,322
Somebody keep guard on him.

176
00:20:00,322 --> 00:20:03,762
Poor Leito, so naive.
You think this will change anything?

177
00:20:03,762 --> 00:20:05,642
This will be a lesson for the rest of them.

178
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:10,922
I don't need useless court cases.
Put him in a cell and you can go.

179
00:20:10,922 --> 00:20:14,762
Don't let him go.
You have no idea what will happen now.

180
00:20:14,842 --> 00:20:17,562
I don't care what's gonna happen here,
we are already leaving.

181
00:20:17,562 --> 00:20:20,522
It's your job to end this nightmare
in our neighbourhood!

182
00:20:21,162 --> 00:20:24,922
You still don't get it!
This area is surrounded by walls and barbed wire.

183
00:20:24,922 --> 00:20:28,882
They've covered it from the top downwards and it will be destroyed.
Then this whole nightmare will end.

184
00:20:28,882 --> 00:20:32,802
Be glad you're in this cell.
Outside, a band of zombies is waiting for your blood.

185
00:20:32,962 --> 00:20:34,442
Taha, your still here?

186
00:20:34,442 --> 00:20:37,642
My band of zombies could
teach you a thing or two, chief.

187
00:20:38,562 --> 00:20:41,642
Don't start, Taha.
You're free, what else do you want?

188
00:20:42,962 --> 00:20:44,562
- The girl.
- No!

189
00:20:48,962 --> 00:20:50,762
- Take her.
- No!

190
00:20:50,762 --> 00:20:52,642
Try an touch her.

191
00:20:54,122 --> 00:20:57,562
- Lola! Lola!
- Don't worry, I'll take care of her.

192
00:20:58,562 --> 00:21:01,762
Gentlemen, it's always a pleasure doing business.

193
00:21:02,162 --> 00:21:02,962
Goodbye.

194
00:21:03,922 --> 00:21:06,962
No! Noo!

195
00:21:17,362 --> 00:21:20,962
Take her to my office. Inject her with
a couple of doses to calm her down.

196
00:21:23,322 --> 00:21:25,282
Don't stand around, get to work lads.

197
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,722
I didn't have a choice.

198
00:21:33,362 --> 00:21:35,442
I've spent 15 years in this neighbourhood.

199
00:21:37,122 --> 00:21:39,882
My pension's coming up
and I want to end this.

200
00:21:40,962 --> 00:21:42,362
I'd like it differently.

201
00:21:43,322 --> 00:21:44,362
Sorry.

202
00:21:46,322 --> 00:21:48,762
You gave away my sister
This is the end for you.

203
00:21:53,362 --> 00:21:55,762
6 months later.

204
00:22:04,962 --> 00:22:07,962
Tell me Pedro,
what has that door done to you?

205
00:22:07,962 --> 00:22:10,362
- I'm not Pedro.
- Who gives a fuck what your name is?

206
00:22:10,362 --> 00:22:11,762
That's my car dumb-ass.

207
00:22:12,002 --> 00:22:15,202
What if I hit your stupid head with the same force?

208
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:19,002
- It's only a car.
- Not only a car.

209
00:22:19,402 --> 00:22:20,682
It's my fucking car!

210
00:22:21,202 --> 00:22:23,602
It cost me money,

211
00:22:23,602 --> 00:22:26,482
So be careful with my car,

212
00:22:26,602 --> 00:22:28,602
or I'll crack your head open.

213
00:22:29,402 --> 00:22:33,282
- Do you understand?
- Carlos, don't worry, let's just go.

214
00:22:33,402 --> 00:22:37,202
Stupid son of a bitch.
These latinos have no respect for anything.

215
00:22:37,402 --> 00:22:39,602
Is it so difficult to shut a car door gently?

216
00:22:39,802 --> 00:22:43,202
He understood. He'll be more gentle.
He's the driver, right Pedro?

217
00:22:43,202 --> 00:22:46,202
- I'm not Pedro.
- That's why all the doors squeak.

218
00:22:46,402 --> 00:22:50,002
I spent about 1,5 on that shit
and they still squeak.

219
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:53,402
I'll take care of it, Carlos.
You have my word.

220
00:22:55,602 --> 00:22:59,202
We have a bad team selection,
Time to change. We need to have a word with Franco.

221
00:22:59,402 --> 00:23:02,082
- Ok.
- Because they keep sending us these fucking Portugese.

222
00:23:02,202 --> 00:23:04,202
Thick as shit,
Useless fuckers.

223
00:23:04,202 --> 00:23:06,922
I'll speak to Franco.
We'll sort everything out.

224
00:23:06,922 --> 00:23:09,602
For fucks sake!
I need 2 well educated guys.

225
00:23:09,602 --> 00:23:14,202
We need to grab them straight from Uni.
These fuckers don't even know what a school is.

226
00:23:14,602 --> 00:23:18,482
Benito, in France there are
6 million people unemployed.

227
00:23:18,802 --> 00:23:20,682
Just find me 2 normal guys.

228
00:23:21,002 --> 00:23:23,402
No problem, I'll get on to it.

229
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,282
Do I have to get the door myself?

230
00:23:27,402 --> 00:23:28,202
This is what I'm saying.

231
00:23:44,402 --> 00:23:45,802
Number 5 is the winner!

232
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:49,202
Place your bets.

233
00:23:49,202 --> 00:23:52,002
- You haven't forgotten?
- I remember.

234
00:23:52,602 --> 00:23:54,402
At the end of the week, as promised.

235
00:23:55,202 --> 00:23:59,202
He really hit the bottom,
no shame or conscience.

236
00:23:59,402 --> 00:24:01,802
He owes us big money,
yet he has the balls to show his face here.

237
00:24:02,602 --> 00:24:05,402
A lack of a proper upbringing.
Tactless.

238
00:24:07,002 --> 00:24:08,002
Follow me.

239
00:24:11,802 --> 00:24:13,002
How's things, Ragbi.

240
00:24:18,602 --> 00:24:21,002
- Everything alright, Sam?
- Well, not at the moment.

241
00:24:21,002 --> 00:24:22,402
What's the matter?

242
00:24:24,202 --> 00:24:28,202
- Problems with the police again?
- These two have been standing there for two hours.

243
00:24:28,202 --> 00:24:29,802
Choosing a tin of tuna.

244
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:33,402
- They're pimps.
- Pimps? So what are they doing in the fish section?

245
00:24:33,402 --> 00:24:36,802
Nothing. There waiting until 2:00.
That's when the whores have a coffee break.

246
00:24:37,602 --> 00:24:40,482
You arrive at 1.10 and presto...

247
00:24:40,682 --> 00:24:42,082
...What's been happening on the streets.

248
00:24:44,402 --> 00:24:47,602
- Who the fuck is that?
- Pimps, but not after tinned tuna.

249
00:24:48,202 --> 00:24:51,602
- What else?
- There aren't that many, but its like someone's informed them.

250
00:24:51,602 --> 00:24:53,882
At the same time, when we move the cash.

251
00:24:55,002 --> 00:24:58,602
- What you saying?
- 500,000 straight up. Crazy sum.

252
00:24:58,602 --> 00:25:01,802
If you snitch to the cops,
you can easily earn yourself 10%.

253
00:25:02,002 --> 00:25:04,802
- How do you know?
- It's my job.

254
00:25:04,802 --> 00:25:08,402
- So why didn't you take it?
- How was I to know if they were really cops?

255
00:25:08,602 --> 00:25:11,802
- You little shit!
- Do you want to live?

256
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:15,002
Of course.
Have I finished my studies?

257
00:25:15,002 --> 00:25:19,002
- Yes, with honours.
- You understand, you see the difference?

258
00:25:23,002 --> 00:25:25,002
So you think we have a snitch?

259
00:25:25,802 --> 00:25:27,202
Without a doubt.

260
00:25:39,602 --> 00:25:43,482
- I could sense that there was something about Pedro.
- It wasn't Pedro.

261
00:25:43,602 --> 00:25:47,202
I don't a give a shit.
We are not about to start crying.

262
00:25:47,202 --> 00:25:49,002
We need to take the cash and ourselves outta here.

263
00:25:49,602 --> 00:25:51,802
Don't move.
Leave the money and put your hands in the air!

264
00:25:52,002 --> 00:25:55,322
- Benito, what's with you?
- I'm not Benito but Damien.

265
00:25:55,322 --> 00:25:58,602
Criminal police.
Carlos Montoya, you're under arrest.

266
00:25:59,002 --> 00:26:01,762
- Benito, you're bald?
- You have the right to remain silent,

267
00:26:01,762 --> 00:26:04,482
anything you say
might be used against you in a court of law.

268
00:26:04,602 --> 00:26:07,482
Any sudden movement will be interpreted as aggression.

269
00:26:08,002 --> 00:26:10,602
And I will have to use my gun in self-defence.

270
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:13,202
- What are you saying?
- If you as much as move your ear...

271
00:26:13,202 --> 00:26:17,482
...I will paint this room red.
- Understood, but how do you plan to leave this room?

272
00:26:17,602 --> 00:26:21,202
We stay.
Alone; tell your people to leave.

273
00:26:32,402 --> 00:26:36,402
- Why are you letting them go?
- I only catch the big ones.

274
00:26:36,802 --> 00:26:40,002
- Hamilion in place, begin extraction.
- Copy that Hamilion, commencing.

275
00:26:45,402 --> 00:26:47,802
- What do we do?
- Why are you asking me?

276
00:26:47,802 --> 00:26:49,802
- You're a model student.
- They didn't teach me this.

277
00:26:59,002 --> 00:27:00,002
What in the devil is that?

278
00:27:05,202 --> 00:27:07,803
- You didn't get hit did you?
- No, I'm ok.

279
00:27:07,803 --> 00:27:09,003
Ok, that's good.

280
00:27:14,403 --> 00:27:17,403
- Package ready.
- Copy that, thanks.

281
00:27:23,003 --> 00:27:24,603
All exits covered.

282
00:27:35,003 --> 00:27:36,603
What now, Einstein?

283
00:27:44,203 --> 00:27:46,203
Quickly, there is gonna be a lot of heat soon.

284
00:28:03,003 --> 00:28:04,003
Lower the line.

285
00:28:11,203 --> 00:28:12,883
I'm all out of bullets.

286
00:28:37,803 --> 00:28:41,203
They didn't take the money.
We can split it, close the door.

287
00:31:08,003 --> 00:31:09,803
Ok guys, now it's your turn.

288
00:31:12,803 --> 00:31:14,083
Where were you earlier?

289
00:31:21,603 --> 00:31:23,403
Come on men, forward!

290
00:31:23,403 --> 00:31:25,003
There you go, help yourself.

291
00:31:27,403 --> 00:31:29,603
- Don't resist!
- I'll go on my own.

292
00:31:30,203 --> 00:31:31,003
Excellent work.

293
00:31:31,803 --> 00:31:34,803
Operation complete, home time.

294
00:31:36,203 --> 00:31:40,003
- Captain?
- I've never met such a crook.

295
00:31:40,403 --> 00:31:42,483
That's good.
Thanks for the compliment.

296
00:31:42,603 --> 00:31:45,203
- I trusted you like my brother.
- A brother?

297
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,203
I had to wash your car for 6 months
before you gave me a job.

298
00:31:48,203 --> 00:31:50,603
And before I forget...
Your doors.

299
00:32:01,203 --> 00:32:04,403
That's the squeaking sorted out.
Like I promised.

300
00:32:05,803 --> 00:32:08,683
- Captain Damien, Chief.
- Show him in.

301
00:32:11,803 --> 00:32:16,203
Good morning, Damien.
I've called you in to congratulate you,

302
00:32:16,203 --> 00:32:18,803
but the situation has slightly changed.
Sit.

303
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:21,803
- I prefer to stand if that's all right?
- As you please.

304
00:32:21,803 --> 00:32:24,603
Let me introduce Mr. Krüger,
the Defence Secretary.

305
00:32:24,603 --> 00:32:26,003
And Mr Corsini, his 2nd in command.

306
00:32:26,603 --> 00:32:29,603
They are looking for someone to
take on a special mission.

307
00:32:29,803 --> 00:32:32,603
Mr. Krüger, please
explain the situation to the Captain.

308
00:32:32,603 --> 00:32:37,003
Late last night we were transporting
equipment in an armoured truck,

309
00:32:37,003 --> 00:32:39,203
which ran into some problems along the way.

310
00:32:40,203 --> 00:32:43,603
What the hell, no need for that!
Careful, you're gonna scratch the glass.

311
00:32:44,203 --> 00:32:45,403
Stubborn little shits!

312
00:32:48,603 --> 00:32:50,003
Oh, this is just great!

313
00:32:57,803 --> 00:33:01,803
Luckily the truck has a homing device,
so we know its location.

314
00:33:01,803 --> 00:33:03,203
We need your help to retrieve it.

315
00:33:03,283 --> 00:33:04,483
Where is it?

316
00:33:17,643 --> 00:33:19,043
And what's the equipment?

317
00:33:19,843 --> 00:33:21,443
Prototype nuclear device.

318
00:33:23,043 --> 00:33:24,643
What exactly?

319
00:33:24,643 --> 00:33:27,043
Nuclear-organic bomb, experimental model.

320
00:33:27,043 --> 00:33:30,723
A so-called "clean bomb"
built around neutron technology.

321
00:33:30,843 --> 00:33:32,643
Blast radius of 8km.

322
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:35,843
The fall-out area can be
replanted almost immediately.

323
00:33:35,843 --> 00:33:37,243
Contamination of the environment is nil.

324
00:33:37,243 --> 00:33:38,843
Are you scared that they will
use the bomb on you?

325
00:33:41,043 --> 00:33:44,723
The Eliseye Fields
is not the ideal place for the bomb.

326
00:33:44,843 --> 00:33:46,643
Not ideal, I agree.

327
00:33:46,643 --> 00:33:50,243
There is one more thing...
If tampered with, the bomb will self-destruct in 24 hours.

328
00:33:50,243 --> 00:33:53,843
Unfortunately, the self-destruct system
was activated over an hour ago.

329
00:33:53,843 --> 00:33:56,123
- In 23 hours... it will explode.

330
00:33:56,843 --> 00:33:58,443
- K2?
- What?

331
00:33:58,443 --> 00:34:00,043
You have to sell it to someone.

332
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:05,043
I can't help. There is not enough time.

333
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:09,243
Captain, we are not asking,
just explaining.

334
00:34:09,443 --> 00:34:13,843
You know how I work.
I need time to familiarise myself with the details.

335
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:17,043
2 million people live there.
It's true half are criminals,

336
00:34:17,043 --> 00:34:19,043
but the other half need our help.

337
00:34:19,043 --> 00:34:21,843
Change your methods,
or have those people on your conscience.

338
00:34:22,043 --> 00:34:24,963
How do you begin a mission,
that is doomed to failure?

339
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:27,923
How do I diffuse a bomb
in an area I've never been to?

340
00:34:28,043 --> 00:34:31,203
- There's no way.
- Don't worry, you will have a guide.

341
00:34:31,203 --> 00:34:33,043
Great, I'm gonna have a helper?

342
00:34:33,043 --> 00:34:36,443
This guide was born in the area.
He knows it like the back of his hand.

343
00:34:36,443 --> 00:34:39,843
- Will he help?
- You've asked him, he's been briefed?

344
00:34:39,843 --> 00:34:42,323
He's clueless.
You have to recruit him.

345
00:34:58,643 --> 00:35:01,523
- Leito, you're being moved.
- Where to?

346
00:35:01,603 --> 00:35:02,643
You'll see.

347
00:35:22,243 --> 00:35:24,003
112- in the van.

348
00:35:27,843 --> 00:35:30,643
Let me go! Let go!

349
00:35:34,243 --> 00:35:35,643
Fucking let go!

350
00:35:45,003 --> 00:35:47,523
263- in the van.

351
00:35:49,443 --> 00:35:51,803
You cock sucking, wet tampon!

352
00:36:06,003 --> 00:36:08,044
- How're you?
- Super.

353
00:36:08,404 --> 00:36:10,924
That fucker thought
he could treat me like that.

354
00:36:11,844 --> 00:36:13,284
I'm off.

355
00:36:14,644 --> 00:36:17,084
The doors don't open that easy.

356
00:36:17,244 --> 00:36:19,044
My friend, you obviously don't know me.

357
00:36:19,124 --> 00:36:20,724
They call me Phantom.

358
00:36:20,844 --> 00:36:23,124
Phantom ain't doing an 8 year stretch.

359
00:36:23,244 --> 00:36:26,524
- What you in for?
- I killed 5 guys.

360
00:36:26,524 --> 00:36:29,844
But the main guy got away from me.

361
00:36:29,844 --> 00:36:30,804
What did he do to you?

362
00:36:33,444 --> 00:36:37,244
He killed my dad and brothers.
I won't give up until he's dead.

363
00:36:37,444 --> 00:36:40,804
I'm gonna hit borough 13
and wipe that motherfucker out.

364
00:36:41,644 --> 00:36:44,524
- That's where he lives?
- Yeah, and that's where he'll die.

365
00:36:47,044 --> 00:36:49,444
- What's his name?
- Taha. You heard of him?

366
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:55,244
I wanted to be friends a long time ago
but I regret it now.

367
00:36:55,444 --> 00:36:57,924
He lives in a bunker, a whole army around him.

368
00:36:58,604 --> 00:37:01,044
Motherfucker's got some weird bitch with him all the time.

369
00:37:01,844 --> 00:37:05,444
- Who's that?
- Some drugged up girl that he keeps on a leash.

370
00:37:05,444 --> 00:37:06,444
Like a dog.

371
00:37:06,644 --> 00:37:10,644
The girl is always fucked up on some shit.
I think she's called Lola.

372
00:37:16,444 --> 00:37:18,124
The Phantom will be back in 2 minutes.

373
00:37:32,204 --> 00:37:33,404
Come up front.

374
00:37:39,004 --> 00:37:42,444
- Where you wanna be dropped?
- Borough 13 will be fine.

375
00:37:42,444 --> 00:37:44,604
Wicked.
Damien.

376
00:37:47,604 --> 00:37:48,444
Leito.

377
00:37:56,844 --> 00:38:00,204
Thanks. They are out.
Plan is on course.

378
00:38:00,204 --> 00:38:03,644
- Are they still together?
- Without a doubt. In the truck, we are tailing.

379
00:38:03,644 --> 00:38:06,044
Excellent.
Congratulations, Chief.

380
00:38:06,124 --> 00:38:10,084
Still too early. Escaping from jail is easier
than getting into borough 13.

381
00:38:10,244 --> 00:38:12,684
And we don't know what kind of
guide this Leito will turn out to be.

382
00:38:12,844 --> 00:38:14,444
Without him, Damien won't achieve much.

383
00:38:14,644 --> 00:38:16,604
Your Captain is our last hope.

384
00:38:30,604 --> 00:38:32,644
So are you gonna help me out?
What's the best route to take?

385
00:38:32,644 --> 00:38:34,444
Can we get in undetected?

386
00:38:34,604 --> 00:38:36,004
Yep, throw a right here.

387
00:38:36,764 --> 00:38:39,764
- What are you doing?
- Why? Don't you trust me?

388
00:38:40,404 --> 00:38:44,004
- Get these fucking cuffs off!
- You really want to get into borough 13?

389
00:38:44,204 --> 00:38:47,604
- Yeah. I'm the Phantom now,
so do exactly what I say.

390
00:38:47,604 --> 00:38:48,684
Turn right.

391
00:38:51,204 --> 00:38:53,204
- And now?
- Right.

392
00:39:15,004 --> 00:39:16,204
Turn right.

393
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,044
I said, fucking right!

394
00:39:20,204 --> 00:39:22,204
I'm not fucking deaf, the steering is fucked!

395
00:39:22,564 --> 00:39:23,964
So brake.

396
00:39:25,004 --> 00:39:26,404
The brakes are fucked as well.

397
00:39:31,404 --> 00:39:33,204
Ok, into that car, gently.

398
00:39:39,004 --> 00:39:42,364
- That was supposed to be gentle?
- Look man it was the best I could do.

399
00:39:42,364 --> 00:39:44,604
If you don't like the skills,
run and jump, punk.

400
00:39:44,764 --> 00:39:47,964
- Let me loose.
- You can handle it, boy you got it made.

401
00:39:47,964 --> 00:39:49,084
What you saying?

402
00:39:49,164 --> 00:39:52,164
You're a cop.
You can't fool me.

403
00:39:52,164 --> 00:39:55,964
- So you're gonna leave me here?
- You needed borough 13 and you're in, so bye-bye?

404
00:39:55,964 --> 00:39:58,604
Consult your manual, chapter heading
"Fucked Situation".

405
00:39:58,964 --> 00:40:01,404
Leito, are you mad.
I ain't no cop.

406
00:40:01,404 --> 00:40:03,884
Get me out of here, fuck
I helped you escape, remember?

407
00:40:04,004 --> 00:40:07,004
I know why you helped me.
So I can help you with something right?

408
00:40:07,004 --> 00:40:09,604
Not interested in your stupid agenda.
Fuck off.

409
00:40:09,604 --> 00:40:10,804
Hey, what about your sister?

410
00:40:12,204 --> 00:40:14,444
I don't need your help
to free her.

411
00:40:19,764 --> 00:40:20,604
Shit!

412
00:40:39,364 --> 00:40:42,084
Motherfucking bomba ras, check me car, rudeboy!

413
00:40:43,004 --> 00:40:46,164
Sorry, but I just got out of jail
and the brakes packed up.

414
00:40:46,164 --> 00:40:47,404
I need a hideout.

415
00:40:47,404 --> 00:40:48,484
Hideout?

416
00:40:49,804 --> 00:40:53,164
Boy is you proper fucked up.
Where d'you think this is, Monaco?

417
00:40:53,364 --> 00:40:54,564
This here is Baghdad.

418
00:41:34,004 --> 00:41:37,964
- Out of the way.
- Relax. Easy.

419
00:41:37,964 --> 00:41:40,844
I'm sorry about your car.
Take the truck, deal stands?

420
00:42:02,004 --> 00:42:03,804
Did you dispose of the bomb?

421
00:42:03,804 --> 00:42:07,164
- No, well until. Leito...
- What? Leito?

422
00:42:07,164 --> 00:42:08,564
He escaped from prison.

423
00:42:10,404 --> 00:42:12,364
So he'll be here soon.

424
00:42:16,964 --> 00:42:19,804
Wake up!
Some news about your brother.

425
00:42:19,804 --> 00:42:21,204
He's coming for a visit.

426
00:42:24,404 --> 00:42:27,004
- Be ready.
- Ok.

427
00:42:45,404 --> 00:42:47,364
How did you find out
I was a cop?

428
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:50,164
Your fighting style is too technical.
Training I guess?

429
00:42:50,164 --> 00:42:52,764
But to fit in,
you're lacking something.

430
00:42:52,964 --> 00:42:54,364
- What?
- Real anger.

431
00:42:54,364 --> 00:42:57,404
I guess my training didn't cover that.

432
00:42:57,404 --> 00:42:59,844
Freedom, Fairness, Family,
that's what they taught me.

433
00:42:59,844 --> 00:43:02,284
- Water, gas, electric...
- You can laugh all you want.

434
00:43:02,404 --> 00:43:04,924
- You're lawless.
- I want fairness and justice for everyone.

435
00:43:04,924 --> 00:43:07,404
Everyone, and I'm here to make sure
everyone gets justice.

436
00:43:07,404 --> 00:43:09,564
I'm not a butler,
I don't take orders.

437
00:43:09,564 --> 00:43:11,404
I bite, when I see things
being done against the law.

438
00:43:12,364 --> 00:43:15,804
I was born in this manor.
It's always hard to breathe here.

439
00:43:15,804 --> 00:43:19,804
10 years ago they built a wall
around this place. What did I do?

440
00:43:20,004 --> 00:43:22,444
I didn't break any laws, not one.

441
00:43:22,604 --> 00:43:24,684
I quit school,
not for a job selling crack,

442
00:43:24,764 --> 00:43:26,364
but because they closed the school down.

443
00:43:26,564 --> 00:43:28,964
I was unlucky to be born here.

444
00:43:28,964 --> 00:43:31,204
So you think burning cars
is gonna make things better?

445
00:43:31,204 --> 00:43:33,004
You got a better idea?

446
00:43:33,604 --> 00:43:35,204
Well at the moment, no.

447
00:43:36,804 --> 00:43:39,724
Do you know why I'm here?
Why I let you go?

448
00:43:39,724 --> 00:43:42,604
- A good deed?
- To save this neighbourhood.

449
00:43:42,604 --> 00:43:45,004
There's an active neutron bomb here.
If I don't disable it,

450
00:43:45,004 --> 00:43:48,604
there wont be anything left of this place.
Borough 13 no longer, get me?

451
00:43:48,604 --> 00:43:50,884
Everybody dies.
If I think like you,

452
00:43:51,004 --> 00:43:53,804
what good are these 2 million people?
No use to me.

453
00:43:54,004 --> 00:43:56,004
But there will always be people like you,

454
00:43:56,004 --> 00:43:58,404
who thought the law was on their side, get me?

455
00:43:58,604 --> 00:44:02,404
So you gonna help me with this bomb,
or are you too busy with your own shit?

456
00:44:04,644 --> 00:44:06,244
Is this bomb for real?

457
00:44:07,044 --> 00:44:10,844
- I can't say how it got here.
- But I'm sure Taha has got it.

458
00:44:11,044 --> 00:44:14,444
Yep. Your sister and my bomb,
We gotta link up.

459
00:44:15,444 --> 00:44:17,924
If you're bullshitting,
I will fuck you up, believe me.

460
00:44:19,644 --> 00:44:20,644
That's cool.

461
00:44:23,444 --> 00:44:26,924
- You got a plan?
- I've got to get to Taha un-noticed.

462
00:44:27,044 --> 00:44:30,844
As soon as I take care of the bomb,
I'll free your sister.

463
00:44:30,844 --> 00:44:32,244
And I'm supposed to sit around and wait?

464
00:44:32,244 --> 00:44:33,924
No, you're the distraction.

465
00:44:34,044 --> 00:44:37,644
Taha will be busy with you
and I'll sort everything out.

466
00:44:37,644 --> 00:44:38,524
You like that shit don't you?

467
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,124
- You got a phone?
- Yeah.

468
00:44:42,124 --> 00:44:43,044
Give it to me.

469
00:44:46,244 --> 00:44:48,124
Damn, Phantom, you're going on like James Bond.

470
00:44:48,244 --> 00:44:49,044
Ring.

471
00:44:58,044 --> 00:45:00,044
- Yes.
- It's Leito.

472
00:45:00,844 --> 00:45:04,244
- Where did you get my number from?
- You can buy anything on the inside.

473
00:45:04,244 --> 00:45:06,844
- I heard you're on the outside.
- I'm across from you, the factory.

474
00:45:07,644 --> 00:45:09,044
Who you calling?

475
00:45:12,645 --> 00:45:13,925
So why ring me?

476
00:45:14,045 --> 00:45:16,445
I've got a cop with me.
We've got a proposal for you.

477
00:45:16,845 --> 00:45:18,245
K2 will come and get you.

478
00:45:21,645 --> 00:45:23,245
Are you fucking nuts?

479
00:45:23,245 --> 00:45:26,325
According to the plan,
I was supposed to go in un-noticed.

480
00:45:26,645 --> 00:45:30,645
Stealth like, side entrance,
not the main fucking door.

481
00:45:30,645 --> 00:45:33,845
Forget your police manual.
This is borough 13.

482
00:45:33,845 --> 00:45:35,845
Your laws don't apply, get me?

483
00:45:36,045 --> 00:45:38,845
- And this is the only way.
- Your plan?

484
00:45:38,845 --> 00:45:40,845
He who lives, wins.

485
00:45:40,845 --> 00:45:44,445
Nobody dies.
We have one card to play.

486
00:45:44,445 --> 00:45:46,445
- Which is?
- Curiosity.

487
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:49,645
Who's this cop?

488
00:45:50,645 --> 00:45:53,645
You got the same answers
to every question, huh?

489
00:45:53,645 --> 00:45:55,045
Like fucking cows.

490
00:45:55,445 --> 00:45:59,045
I need info, on this cop.
Before he dies.

491
00:45:59,845 --> 00:46:01,245
You have 5 minutes.

492
00:46:03,445 --> 00:46:06,845
- I don't like it, too risky.
- Without me you'll die.

493
00:46:06,845 --> 00:46:10,125
I always work alone and I'm still alive.
Later.

494
00:46:10,445 --> 00:46:14,245
I know all the ins and outs here.
I dug one tunnel myself.

495
00:46:14,245 --> 00:46:16,045
So you made good use of your hands.

496
00:46:16,045 --> 00:46:19,445
I know where the bomb is.
Without me you'll never find it.

497
00:46:20,245 --> 00:46:22,645
5 minutes ago you didn't even know about the bomb.

498
00:46:22,845 --> 00:46:25,325
- You're fucking with me?
- Taha built a huge bunker a while ago.

499
00:46:25,325 --> 00:46:26,525
And I know where it is.

500
00:46:26,645 --> 00:46:29,445
- How do you know the bomb will be there?
- He don't keep shit like that in his kitchen.

501
00:46:31,045 --> 00:46:34,845
Here's the deal.
I free you and you do what I say.

502
00:46:34,925 --> 00:46:38,045
How about another way. You shut the fuck up
and pray my sister is alive, then I'll find the bomb.

503
00:46:38,045 --> 00:46:41,645
Take these off,
or we both end up in jail.

504
00:46:45,045 --> 00:46:45,845
All right.

505
00:46:51,045 --> 00:46:54,165
- This is the cop?
- Damn you're observant. I'm impressed.

506
00:46:54,165 --> 00:46:57,245
Shut up. If Taha lets you off
I'll deal with you myself!

507
00:46:57,445 --> 00:47:00,645
Lets move, and don't try any weird shit.
The boys are a bit nervous.

508
00:47:16,045 --> 00:47:20,045
- Did you come here to sleep?
- Sorry, just tired.

509
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:21,245
- Where is he?
- His place.

510
00:47:28,245 --> 00:47:31,325
- Has he eaten?
- He eats all the time.

511
00:47:36,445 --> 00:47:39,445
You've got a job.
Warm up.

512
00:47:46,245 --> 00:47:49,445
With this arsenal,
you could take over Paris.

513
00:47:54,645 --> 00:47:58,245
- That's the bomb transporter.
- So it's still here.

514
00:48:05,845 --> 00:48:07,525
Wait here. I'll be quick.

515
00:48:07,645 --> 00:48:08,645
No thanks.

516
00:48:24,645 --> 00:48:26,645
So you're friendly with the cops now?

517
00:48:27,045 --> 00:48:30,445
He ain't my friend, but only he knows how
to de-activate the bomb.

518
00:48:30,645 --> 00:48:33,845
- Really?
- It will destroy everything within 8km.

519
00:48:33,845 --> 00:48:35,445
So you came to rescue us?

520
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:38,445
I can stop the clock
and save 2 million people.

521
00:48:38,645 --> 00:48:43,245
The Government sends a cop to save us from a bomb.
That's so noble.

522
00:48:44,245 --> 00:48:45,845
Hysterical.

523
00:48:46,245 --> 00:48:49,445
To be honest,
we weren't planning to keep it here.

524
00:48:49,645 --> 00:48:52,045
- Do you wanna take it?
- Yes.

525
00:48:52,245 --> 00:48:53,245
How much for?

526
00:48:56,045 --> 00:48:58,445
If I don't enter the correct code within the hour,
this whole place blows.

527
00:48:58,445 --> 00:49:01,845
I know. Although by that time
I'll have already sold it.

528
00:49:01,845 --> 00:49:05,645
If you don't want to wait too long for the explosion,
I suggest you start negotiations.

529
00:49:05,645 --> 00:49:08,925
- Innocent people will die.
- You should of thought of that earlier.

530
00:49:09,045 --> 00:49:10,845
For example,
when you were making it.

531
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:18,445
Million euro.

532
00:49:18,645 --> 00:49:22,645
Million on my right. Not much.
Anybody else eager, K2?

533
00:49:24,645 --> 00:49:27,445
2 million!
Brave K2 is saying 2 million.

534
00:49:27,445 --> 00:49:28,845
Any more?

535
00:49:29,445 --> 00:49:33,845
- 4! - 4 million just in
time. - 4 million on my right.

536
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:37,445
- How long are you gonna barter?
- Until our lives are worthless.

537
00:49:37,445 --> 00:49:38,645
Come on, tell me.

538
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:45,445
10! 10 million on my left
It's getting interesting!

539
00:49:46,245 --> 00:49:51,445
So bro, 10 million.
Any more offers?

540
00:49:53,045 --> 00:49:57,045
Oh well, I think the reserve has been met.
10 million going once!

541
00:49:59,045 --> 00:50:00,445
10 million twice!

542
00:50:04,445 --> 00:50:06,445
20.

543
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:08,845
That's a big jump up.

544
00:50:09,845 --> 00:50:13,045
- K2?
- Let him have it, I pass.

545
00:50:13,645 --> 00:50:16,845
20 million?
Sold!

546
00:50:16,845 --> 00:50:18,045
Good buy.

547
00:50:18,045 --> 00:50:20,645
For saving 2 million people,
it works out 10 euro a head...

548
00:50:20,845 --> 00:50:22,645
...cheaper than a "Happy Meal".

549
00:50:23,845 --> 00:50:26,245
- Payment method?
- Transfer.

550
00:50:26,645 --> 00:50:29,445
Before you get confirmation of payment
the bomb will explode.

551
00:50:31,245 --> 00:50:34,445
Jamel, the account number in the Bahamas.

552
00:50:40,045 --> 00:50:43,645
- I need to see the bomb.
- Funny, I thought you might.

553
00:50:43,845 --> 00:50:45,045
Only quick.

554
00:50:51,045 --> 00:50:55,045
It didn't come with its own rocket.
Luckily I had a few stored already.

555
00:50:55,045 --> 00:50:57,245
A revamped ex-soviet missile.

556
00:50:57,245 --> 00:51:01,045
Ready to blast off.
Destination? Well you can figure it out.

557
00:51:17,245 --> 00:51:21,645
So then, cop, you've seen your bomb.
You can start the money transfer.

558
00:51:28,445 --> 00:51:32,645
Leito, I've learnt from my mistakes.
Now I'm one step ahead.

559
00:51:42,045 --> 00:51:44,245
Put me in touch with Krüger; urgent.

560
00:52:28,445 --> 00:52:31,045
8, 47, 35,

561
00:52:31,445 --> 00:52:34,045
Sulu, Sulu, Fox, Delta, Charlie.

562
00:52:34,245 --> 00:52:36,445
- Amount?
- 20 million euro.

563
00:52:37,245 --> 00:52:39,045
Are you certain of the bomb's location?

564
00:52:41,045 --> 00:52:43,845
It's in front of me.
48 minutes left on the clock.

565
00:52:44,845 --> 00:52:47,245
Not enough in the budget.

566
00:52:47,245 --> 00:52:49,445
- Please find other means.
- I'm sorry.

567
00:52:58,245 --> 00:53:00,845
Fine, I'll wait.
The transfer will be ready soon.

568
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:03,845
Thanks, Sarge.

569
00:53:04,845 --> 00:53:08,445
That's it, 20 million transferred
to your account. My turn with the code.

570
00:53:09,245 --> 00:53:13,045
The transaction isn't done yet.
Jamel, phone the Bahamas and check.

571
00:53:13,045 --> 00:53:14,045
One minute.

572
00:53:21,445 --> 00:53:23,645
The bank opens in 30 minutes.

573
00:53:23,645 --> 00:53:27,045
Goddamn, let's hope it does.
In this event you will have to wait.

574
00:53:28,645 --> 00:53:32,645
Get comfortable. On your knees.
Faces to the wall, hands on heads.

575
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:38,445
Yoyo, keep them there until further orders.

576
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:46,645
- So now what?
- You wanted to come here.

577
00:53:46,645 --> 00:53:48,645
If not for you, we wouldn't be here.

578
00:53:49,045 --> 00:53:52,045
And if your Generals had transferred the money,
we would be free.

579
00:53:52,045 --> 00:53:55,645
No, we would be dead.
You think, Taha would let us live?

580
00:53:55,845 --> 00:53:58,245
Fuck no, but they still didn't pay.

581
00:53:59,445 --> 00:54:01,525
How valuable are you to them?

582
00:54:03,045 --> 00:54:05,125
Shit, they couldn't care less.

583
00:54:10,445 --> 00:54:13,366
Damien, something doesn't quite add up here.

584
00:54:13,366 --> 00:54:16,246
- Why is that?
- It doesn't make sense.

585
00:54:16,846 --> 00:54:20,846
They lost the bomb, like it was a car key.
They want it back, but not at the price.

586
00:54:20,846 --> 00:54:22,926
When it comes to money,
they stop thinking.

587
00:54:23,046 --> 00:54:27,846
- And you're defending them?
- Not them, the law.

588
00:54:28,646 --> 00:54:30,846
Plus human life, just like you.

589
00:54:47,446 --> 00:54:48,646
How long?

590
00:54:53,446 --> 00:54:54,646
37 minutes.

591
00:54:55,646 --> 00:54:58,646
- We have to do something!
- You think?

592
00:54:59,086 --> 00:55:02,286
- I've an idea.
- What?

593
00:55:03,886 --> 00:55:06,886
- Remember the tunnel?
- The one I dug?

594
00:55:06,886 --> 00:55:09,486
The same one.
The entrance is in the toilet.

595
00:55:09,486 --> 00:55:10,886
Left from the lift.

596
00:55:13,486 --> 00:55:15,886
You think he'll let us go to the John together?

597
00:55:15,886 --> 00:55:18,486
No, we make an excuse
to talk with Taha.

598
00:55:18,686 --> 00:55:20,286
And we walk past the toilet.

599
00:55:21,486 --> 00:55:24,686
Sweet. So when we get to the lift, what?

600
00:55:24,886 --> 00:55:27,286
- Improvise.
- That's half a plan!

601
00:55:27,286 --> 00:55:29,486
- You got a better one?
- No.

602
00:55:29,686 --> 00:55:30,686
Then let's go.

603
00:55:33,286 --> 00:55:36,086
- Who let you get up?
- We need to see Taha, it's urgent.

604
00:55:36,086 --> 00:55:40,566
All right. I see, sit your ass down,
before I put you down, fool!

605
00:55:40,886 --> 00:55:43,686
You've got no sense have you?
What's your name?

606
00:55:43,686 --> 00:55:44,686
What's it to you?

607
00:55:44,686 --> 00:55:48,286
I'll need to tell Taha when he asks me,
who lost him 20 million.

608
00:55:48,286 --> 00:55:49,286
Your name.

609
00:55:51,086 --> 00:55:53,686
If you're pulling my dick,
I'll have you!

610
00:55:53,686 --> 00:55:54,486
Ok.

611
00:55:54,886 --> 00:55:57,686
You three, with me.
The rest, cover.

612
00:55:59,086 --> 00:56:02,486
- When to improvise?
- It will come naturally.

613
00:56:12,886 --> 00:56:14,686
- Backflip, on the run.
- How?

614
00:56:14,686 --> 00:56:15,486
Move.

615
00:56:39,886 --> 00:56:43,086
- This is our way out.
- We're gonna go through the toilet?

616
00:56:54,486 --> 00:56:56,686
- I'm a bad-ass cop.
- Run.

617
00:57:00,486 --> 00:57:03,886
What's up, what's happened?
Why didn't you reply?

618
00:57:04,086 --> 00:57:07,686
- We were in a tunnel.
- What tunnel? You playing some kind of game?

619
00:57:07,686 --> 00:57:09,286
It's cos of those two idiots.

620
00:57:09,286 --> 00:57:13,086
They escaped through a tunnel.
We ran after them but got kinda lost.

621
00:57:13,086 --> 00:57:15,086
Hold on, repeat that slowly.

622
00:57:15,086 --> 00:57:16,486
They escaped...

623
00:57:26,686 --> 00:57:28,966
Jamel, the transaction?

624
00:57:34,286 --> 00:57:36,686
- I've got bad news.
- He was bluffing?

625
00:57:36,686 --> 00:57:38,686
- Yes.
- I thought so.

626
00:57:38,886 --> 00:57:41,886
You can't trust a cop.
Stupid of me to think I could.

627
00:57:42,046 --> 00:57:45,166
He'll pay.
I'm gonna launch that bomb.

628
00:57:45,166 --> 00:57:48,246
Taha, that's not all.
You better sit down.

629
00:57:51,446 --> 00:57:55,046
They used our account number
to take money out of the account...

630
00:57:55,046 --> 00:57:56,726
...and other accounts.

631
00:57:56,846 --> 00:57:58,646
Which other accounts?

632
00:57:59,446 --> 00:58:03,446
Bahamas, Riyadh, Karachi,
even London. All zero balances.

633
00:58:06,446 --> 00:58:08,246
How'd they manage that?

634
00:58:08,446 --> 00:58:11,246
I don't know. If I find out,
I can rule the world.

635
00:58:12,846 --> 00:58:16,646
To be honest, I'm a bad hacker,
so I resign.

636
00:58:21,446 --> 00:58:22,446
Excuse me.

637
00:58:29,646 --> 00:58:34,446
Taha, if you're broke,
how you gonna pay us for this week?

638
00:58:46,046 --> 00:58:49,446
There's money in the safe, downstairs.
They haven't touched that.

639
00:58:49,846 --> 00:58:51,646
K2, gimme your gun.

640
00:58:55,846 --> 00:58:57,646
My gun, why?

641
00:59:10,046 --> 00:59:12,846
You're all a bunch of useless thugs.

642
00:59:37,046 --> 00:59:39,046
So what now, K2?

643
00:59:45,846 --> 00:59:50,246
We need to catch those two.
I'm calling a safari.

644
01:00:49,646 --> 01:00:50,846
Split up.

645
01:02:20,646 --> 01:02:22,526
Out of the way!
Move!

646
01:02:24,846 --> 01:02:25,646
Police!

647
01:03:09,646 --> 01:03:11,446
When's the bomb gonna blow?

648
01:03:12,046 --> 01:03:14,647
- In 10 minutes.
- Can you disable it?

649
01:03:14,647 --> 01:03:16,047
Yes. Nobody but me.

650
01:03:16,247 --> 01:03:19,847
Ok, you deal with the bomb
and your friend stays with us.

651
01:03:19,847 --> 01:03:21,847
- I need his help.
- He stays.

652
01:03:21,847 --> 01:03:25,127
Ok, me and Leito stay here,
and you go diffuse the bomb.

653
01:03:25,447 --> 01:03:26,847
9 minutes left.

654
01:03:31,047 --> 01:03:35,247
Ok, both of you go.
You have to come down eventually.

655
01:03:35,447 --> 01:03:38,247
If all goes well,
you'll be glad to see me.

656
01:04:07,847 --> 01:04:11,047
- Who's this?
- Present from Taha.

657
01:04:12,247 --> 01:04:13,647
Nice present.

658
01:05:02,647 --> 01:05:05,647
Hey, big guy, let me show you a new trick!

659
01:05:43,047 --> 01:05:43,847
Go!

660
01:05:56,287 --> 01:06:00,287
- Were did you learn that?
- I read it in an anglers magazine.

661
01:06:26,487 --> 01:06:28,487
It's ok, Lola.
It's over.

662
01:06:32,087 --> 01:06:33,687
No, it ain't over yet.

663
01:06:36,887 --> 01:06:38,487
No signal.

664
01:06:41,487 --> 01:06:43,087
Finally.

665
01:06:43,487 --> 01:06:46,687
Don't worry.
He'll free us.

666
01:06:49,887 --> 01:06:52,087
- Hello.
- Captain Tomaso?

667
01:06:52,087 --> 01:06:53,687
I'm at the bomb. I need the code.

668
01:06:53,687 --> 01:06:56,087
- Where are you?
- At the bloody bomb! 3 minutes left.

669
01:06:56,087 --> 01:06:57,687
Give me the code,
there's no time to chit chat!

670
01:06:57,887 --> 01:06:59,087
Your exact location?

671
01:06:59,087 --> 01:07:02,087
On top of a tall building, central borough 13.
Enough?

672
01:07:02,287 --> 01:07:06,087
- Good work, we are proud of you.
- The code?

673
01:07:06,687 --> 01:07:09,487
- 9293...
- 9293...

674
01:07:09,687 --> 01:07:11,967
...709B13.

675
01:07:12,087 --> 01:07:15,087
709B13, I'll call back
if I'm still alive.

676
01:07:23,087 --> 01:07:24,967
B13, borough 13.

677
01:07:25,087 --> 01:07:29,887
Strange that the bomb has that code.
And 9293 is our map co-ordinates.

678
01:07:29,887 --> 01:07:31,487
Coincidence.

679
01:07:31,887 --> 01:07:35,087
Damien, wait. This bomb
is not meant for here.

680
01:07:35,087 --> 01:07:38,687
- Then why do the co-ordinates match?
- We need to disarm it anyway.

681
01:07:39,087 --> 01:07:41,687
- What if it's all back to front?
- Back to front?

682
01:07:41,687 --> 01:07:43,567
Instead of disarming it,
you're gonna arm it!

683
01:07:43,687 --> 01:07:46,887
Are you nuts? Then why send me?
It would have exploded itself.

684
01:07:46,887 --> 01:07:49,487
They had to find out if
it was in the right place.

685
01:07:49,567 --> 01:07:52,767
Isn't that what the Chief asked?
If it's in the central area?

686
01:07:52,767 --> 01:07:54,087
Yeah, but that's a standard question.

687
01:07:54,087 --> 01:07:57,287
- It's a trap, I'm certain.
- Fuck off, don't interfere!

688
01:08:03,687 --> 01:08:07,687
- I saved your life once already.
- I'm under orders to do this.

689
01:08:24,287 --> 01:08:25,247
I'm sorry.

690
01:08:51,087 --> 01:08:53,047
Stop, Leito, in a minute
we all blow up!

691
01:08:53,047 --> 01:08:55,287
Open your fucking eyes, Damien! Are you blind
to the fact that they don't care about this area!

692
01:08:55,287 --> 01:08:57,447
For 20 years they couldn't solve the problem.

693
01:08:57,447 --> 01:09:00,407
They put up a huge wall,
and now they want to clean the place up.

694
01:09:00,407 --> 01:09:02,647
The local authority is gone.
No post office, no schools.

695
01:09:02,647 --> 01:09:04,687
Even the police have left.

696
01:09:04,687 --> 01:09:08,447
- The bomb was stolen, they didn't build it here.
- They blew open the truck?

697
01:09:08,447 --> 01:09:09,487
- Yeah?
- Yes!

698
01:09:09,567 --> 01:09:11,687
- They sold you a lie.
- Yeah?

699
01:09:11,687 --> 01:09:13,847
Then explain to me why
the truck is in one piece?

700
01:09:13,967 --> 01:09:16,287
Why there are no signs of a blast?
The lack of doors?

701
01:09:16,647 --> 01:09:19,447
- Maybe it was a different truck.
- You know it's the same one!

702
01:09:19,647 --> 01:09:22,447
As soon as they were certain
the bomb was in borough 13

703
01:09:22,447 --> 01:09:25,247
they called you,
so you could activate it. You get me?

704
01:09:25,247 --> 01:09:29,687
And you nearly went though with it!
You got rid of Taha for them and now everybody else...

705
01:09:49,687 --> 01:09:52,967
You can't kill 2 million people
just because of a few social problems!

706
01:09:52,967 --> 01:09:56,287
How many will they kill because of
the colour of their hair or eyes?

707
01:10:12,687 --> 01:10:13,847
I'm sorry, Leito.

708
01:10:29,487 --> 01:10:31,087
- Sorry.
- You can't, Lola.

709
01:10:31,087 --> 01:10:33,887
I prefer to die believing
my brother instead of you.

710
01:11:03,287 --> 01:11:07,287
- That it?
- Yeah, this time around that's it.

711
01:11:11,487 --> 01:11:13,087
No, that's not it.

712
01:11:29,887 --> 01:11:32,767
I said you'd be glad to
see me again.

713
01:11:33,047 --> 01:11:37,247
- You've got 5 minutes to leave.
- I'm taking this.

714
01:11:37,887 --> 01:11:39,087
It's yours.

715
01:11:51,687 --> 01:11:53,887
Right.
Nothing.

716
01:11:53,887 --> 01:11:57,687
- The bomb was supposed to go off an hour ago.
- What do we do if it doesn't happen?

717
01:11:57,687 --> 01:12:00,687
Dunno. It was supposed to blow...
then nothing happened.

718
01:12:01,247 --> 01:12:03,487
- What's that noise?
- Sounds like fighting.

719
01:12:03,487 --> 01:12:04,487
Check it out!

720
01:12:17,648 --> 01:12:20,088
The mission was almost a success. Almost.

721
01:12:20,088 --> 01:12:22,248
At the last minute
I couldn't remember the code.

722
01:12:22,248 --> 01:12:23,888
It happens.

723
01:12:23,888 --> 01:12:26,048
It's my fault,
I forget the numbers.

724
01:12:26,248 --> 01:12:28,288
- Maybe you remember?
- Yeah.

725
01:12:28,368 --> 01:12:31,568
This is a great guy.
You've taught me so much.

726
01:12:31,648 --> 01:12:33,048
Without him I'd have died.

727
01:12:33,888 --> 01:12:35,488
So what are the numbers?

728
01:12:35,648 --> 01:12:39,088
- 9293.
- Like the area?

729
01:12:39,088 --> 01:12:42,488
- Yes.
- Little coincidence.

730
01:12:43,288 --> 01:12:46,848
Next, 709.
Easy to remember, today's date.

731
01:12:47,048 --> 01:12:50,688
709, 7th September.
Day of delivery. Wicked, huh?

732
01:12:51,048 --> 01:12:55,688
Little bomb in the right place...
and all your problems can go away.

733
01:12:56,648 --> 01:12:58,488
Correct me if I'm wrong.

734
01:12:58,688 --> 01:13:02,448
Back to the code.
I think it's coming to me.

735
01:13:02,688 --> 01:13:05,048
The last digits are..., B13.

736
01:13:05,488 --> 01:13:08,688
Borough 13.
How could I forget.

737
01:13:09,688 --> 01:13:11,088
The rest you can do.

738
01:13:11,088 --> 01:13:13,528
Are you crazy?
Do you want to blow up the middle of Paris?

739
01:13:13,528 --> 01:13:15,968
I don't get it.
Isn't this the code to disarm the bomb?

740
01:13:16,088 --> 01:13:18,088
I hope it's not a code
to arm it?

741
01:13:18,088 --> 01:13:21,688
- Enough of these charades! You know full well!
- No I don't. Explain it to me.

742
01:13:21,688 --> 01:13:24,848
Borough 13 is uncontrollable.
The upkeep is too expensive.

743
01:13:24,848 --> 01:13:27,288
People don't want to pay for
the scum of society.

744
01:13:27,368 --> 01:13:31,848
- So you clean up with a bomb?
- Yeah! Undemocratic, but it solves a lot of problems.

745
01:13:31,848 --> 01:13:33,488
Bar one. Yours.

746
01:13:34,648 --> 01:13:37,448
- No, no don't do it.
- But you wanna clean up?

747
01:13:37,448 --> 01:13:40,688
- We'll all die.
- You should of thought of that when you built it.

748
01:13:40,688 --> 01:13:41,448
No!

749
01:13:54,688 --> 01:13:57,848
You believed me? That I'd blow
everything up, including ourselves?

750
01:13:58,688 --> 01:14:00,848
No. There are other ways to
solve problems of this nature.

751
01:14:01,088 --> 01:14:02,688
More democratic.

752
01:14:03,888 --> 01:14:06,088
Can you look out of the window and wave.

753
01:14:09,048 --> 01:14:10,288
How's the sound?

754
01:14:11,848 --> 01:14:14,648
- What are you doing, Tomaso?
- My job, sir.

755
01:14:14,648 --> 01:14:16,248
Do you know sir, what my mission is?

756
01:14:16,488 --> 01:14:18,688
Law and order in this country
is equal for everybody.

757
01:14:18,688 --> 01:14:21,288
And I just make sure
that nobody forgets it.

758
01:14:21,288 --> 01:14:22,088
That's my job.

759
01:14:22,288 --> 01:14:26,048
If you still can't understand this,
then watch the TV

760
01:14:26,048 --> 01:14:27,888
and you'll find out soon enough.

761
01:14:27,888 --> 01:14:29,688
...or order it over the net.

762
01:14:29,688 --> 01:14:31,888
You can buy the ticket on the train.

763
01:14:31,888 --> 01:14:34,448
But the counters at the station don't have any.

764
01:14:34,688 --> 01:14:37,488
This situation will last for awhile.

765
01:14:37,488 --> 01:14:42,648
The railway is planning a timetable,
that's needed for the

766
01:14:42,648 --> 01:14:44,688
computerised system.

767
01:14:44,888 --> 01:14:48,248
Borough 13 is uncontrollable.
The upkeep is too expensive.

768
01:14:48,328 --> 01:14:50,648
People don't want to pay for
the scum of society.

769
01:14:50,848 --> 01:14:56,008
- So clean up with a bomb?
- People don't want to pay for the scum of society.

770
01:14:56,088 --> 01:14:59,688
Borough 13 is uncontrollable.
The upkeep is too expensive.

771
01:14:59,688 --> 01:15:02,288
People don't want to pay for
the scum of society.

772
01:15:02,288 --> 01:15:07,728
- So you clean up with a bomb?
- Yeah. Undemocratic, but it solves a lot of problems.

773
01:15:07,888 --> 01:15:10,688
Bar one. Yours.

774
01:15:32,088 --> 01:15:33,688
Are you sure you don't want to stay?

775
01:15:34,488 --> 01:15:36,768
With your bonus you can
get a really nice pad.

776
01:15:36,848 --> 01:15:39,488
I've got a pad.
It's my neighbourhood.

777
01:15:39,648 --> 01:15:43,288
I was born here.
Maybe it ain't too peaceful but...

778
01:15:43,288 --> 01:15:46,648
Relax, Leito.
From Monday they're gonna start tearing down the walls.

779
01:15:47,088 --> 01:15:49,888
By the end of the month,
the police and schools will be back.

780
01:15:50,688 --> 01:15:53,448
You glad?
It's thanks to you.

781
01:15:53,648 --> 01:15:56,448
He's the best in the world.
I always knew that.

782
01:15:56,648 --> 01:15:58,968
Cheer up! Why so gloomy?

783
01:15:59,888 --> 01:16:02,968
I just hope the Government
will carry out their promises.

784
01:16:03,048 --> 01:16:05,048
They've no other choice.

785
01:16:06,048 --> 01:16:08,368
Promises made
must always be fulfilled.

786
01:16:08,488 --> 01:16:11,088
There will always be someone like me
to make it happen.

787
01:16:14,088 --> 01:16:17,488
- Take it easy.
- You say that like I live in a dangerous area.

788
01:16:17,688 --> 01:16:20,288
Yours is more dangerous
then mine, Damien.

789
01:16:20,288 --> 01:16:22,088
It's a matter of acclimatising.

790
01:16:24,248 --> 01:16:25,448
Come visit.

791
01:16:27,488 --> 01:16:28,688
I'll try.

792
01:16:35,088 --> 01:16:36,648
He'll definitely come now.

793
01:16:41,488 --> 01:16:42,248
Welcome.

794
01:16:44,088 --> 01:16:44,688
Thanks.

795
01:16:47,848 --> 01:16:49,088
You can pass.

796
01:16:50,305 --> 01:16:56,435
Better than Tinder on
