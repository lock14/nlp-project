1
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:41,875
<i>I was sheriff of this county
when I was 25 years old.</i>

2
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,003
<i>Hard to believe.</i>

3
00:00:44,128 --> 00:00:47,715
<i>My grandfather was a lawman.
Father, too.</i>

4
00:00:48,633 --> 00:00:50,509
<i>Me and him was sheriffs
at the same time,</i>

5
00:00:50,634 --> 00:00:53,387
<i>him up in Plano and me out here.</i>

6
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:56,515
<i>I think he's pretty proud of that.</i>

7
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,393
<i>I know I was.</i>

8
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:03,146
<i>Some of the old-time sheriffs
never even wore a gun.</i>

9
00:01:03,189 --> 00:01:05,066
<i>A lot of folks find that hard to believe.</i>

10
00:01:05,149 --> 00:01:08,361
<i>Jim Scarborough never carried one.
That's the younger Jim.</i>

11
00:01:08,486 --> 00:01:12,156
<i>Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear one
up in Comanche County.</i>

12
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:16,578
<i>I always liked to hear about
the old-timers.</i>

13
00:01:16,661 --> 00:01:19,329
<i>Never missed a chance to do so.</i>

14
00:01:20,164 --> 00:01:24,293
<i>You can't help but compare yourself
against the old-timers.</i>

15
00:01:24,376 --> 00:01:28,131
<i>Can't help but wonder how
they'd have operated these times.</i>

16
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:30,424
<i>There's this boy
I sent to the electric chair</i>

17
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:33,093
<i>at Huntsville here a while back.</i>

18
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:36,055
<i>My arrest and my testimony.</i>

19
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,227
<i>He killed a 14-year-old girl.</i>

20
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:43,771
<i>Paper said it was a crime of passion,</i>

21
00:01:43,854 --> 00:01:46,649
<i>but he told me
there wasn't any passion to it.</i>

22
00:01:46,733 --> 00:01:49,109
<i>Told me he'd been planning
to kill somebody</i>

23
00:01:49,192 --> 00:01:50,902
<i>for about as long
as he could remember.</i>

24
00:01:50,986 --> 00:01:53,948
<i>Said if they turned him out,
he'd do it again.</i>

25
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:56,617
<i>Said he knew he was going to hell.</i>

26
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,871
<i>Be there in about 15 minutes.
I don't know what to make of that.</i>

27
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,915
<i>I sure do don't.</i>

28
00:02:05,584 --> 00:02:09,463
<i>The crime you see now,
it's hard to even take its measure.</i>

29
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:12,759
<i>It's not that I'm afraid of it.</i>

30
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:18,514
<i>I always knew you had to be willing
to die to even do this job.</i>

31
00:02:18,598 --> 00:02:22,100
<i>But I don't want
to push my chips forward</i>

32
00:02:22,185 --> 00:02:26,063
<i>and go out and meet something
I don't understand.</i>

33
00:02:30,109 --> 00:02:33,028
<i>Man would have
to put his soul at hazard.</i>

34
00:02:34,614 --> 00:02:36,699
<i>He'd have to say, "Okay.</i>

35
00:02:40,828 --> 00:02:43,163
<i>"I'll be part Of this world."</i>

36
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,335
Yes, sir, I just walked in the door.

37
00:02:47,418 --> 00:02:49,503
Sheriff, he had some sort
of thing on him,

38
00:02:49,586 --> 00:02:53,216
like a oxygen tank for emphysema
or something

39
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:55,593
and a hose that run down his sleeve.

40
00:02:55,676 --> 00:02:58,346
<i>Oxygen tank?
What the hell's he got that for?</i>

41
00:02:58,429 --> 00:03:00,931
You got me.
Well, you can look at it when you get in.

42
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,265
<i>I'll be down there in a bit.</i>

43
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,769
Yes, sir, I got it under control.

44
00:04:42,408 --> 00:04:46,286
- Howdy. What's this about?
- Step out of the car, please, sir.

45
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,999
- What is that?
- I need you to step out of the car, sir.

46
00:04:57,632 --> 00:05:00,175
- What is that for?
- Would you...

47
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:02,803
Would you hold still, please, sir?

48
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:34,293
You hold still.

49
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,680
Shit.

50
00:09:35,826 --> 00:09:37,702
I ain't got no water.

51
00:09:53,219 --> 00:09:55,678
I told you, I ain't got no <i>agua.</i>

52
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:11,986
Do you speak English?

53
00:10:13,614 --> 00:10:15,573
Where's the last guy?

54
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:18,827
<i>Ãšltimo hombre</i>. Last man standing.
There must have been one.

55
00:10:18,911 --> 00:10:20,495
Where'd he go?

56
00:10:26,710 --> 00:10:29,379
I reckon I go out the way I come in.

57
00:10:35,385 --> 00:10:37,303
There ain't no <i>lobos.</i>

58
00:10:51,943 --> 00:10:54,572
You stopped to watch your backtrack.

59
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,741
Now shoot my dumb ass.

60
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:03,581
But if you stop,

61
00:11:04,748 --> 00:11:06,667
you stopped in shade.

62
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,374
Yeah.

63
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:30,245
- What's in the satchel?
- It's full of money.

64
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:33,289
That'll be the day.

65
00:14:33,374 --> 00:14:36,376
- Where'd you get the pistol?
- At the getting place.

66
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:40,588
- Did you buy that gun?
- No. I found it.

67
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:45,927
- Llewelyn.
- What? Quit your hollering.

68
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,806
What'd you give for that thing?

69
00:14:49,472 --> 00:14:52,850
Well, you don't need to know
everything, Carla Jean.

70
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,977
I need to know that.

71
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:56,397
Keep running that mouth of yours,

72
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,024
I'm gonna take you in the back
and screw you.

73
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:00,692
Big talk.

74
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,318
Keep if UP-

75
00:15:02,403 --> 00:15:05,405
Fine. I don't want to know.

76
00:15:05,489 --> 00:15:08,575
I don't even want to know
where you been all day.

77
00:15:09,576 --> 00:15:11,370
That'll work.

78
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:26,802
All right.

79
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:35,309
- Llewelyn?
- Yeah?

80
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:41,232
- What're you doing, baby?
- I'm going out.

81
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:43,110
Going where?

82
00:15:43,192 --> 00:15:46,321
A little something I forgot to do,
but I'll be back.

83
00:15:46,404 --> 00:15:48,197
And what're you gonna do?

84
00:15:48,282 --> 00:15:52,494
I'm fixing to do something dumber
than hell, but I'm going anyways.

85
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:56,581
If I don't come back,
you tell Mother I love her.

86
00:15:57,582 --> 00:15:59,835
Your mother's dead, Llewelyn.

87
00:16:03,714 --> 00:16:06,048
Well, then I'll tell her myself.

88
00:20:59,175 --> 00:21:02,345
- How much?
- 69 cents.

89
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:04,138
And the gas?

90
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,892
Y'all getting any rain up your way?

91
00:21:07,683 --> 00:21:11,520
- What way would that be?
- Well, I seen you was from Dallas.

92
00:21:13,315 --> 00:21:16,984
What business is it of yours
where I'm from,

93
00:21:18,028 --> 00:21:19,528
friend-o?

94
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,035
- Well, I didn't mean nothing by it.
- You didn't mean nothing?

95
00:21:25,117 --> 00:21:27,496
I was just passing the time.

96
00:21:29,038 --> 00:21:33,335
If you don't want to accept that,
I don't know what else I can do for you.

97
00:21:35,711 --> 00:21:39,298
- Will there be something else?
- I don't know. Will there?

98
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:46,972
Is something wrong?

99
00:21:47,057 --> 00:21:48,974
- With what?
- With anything.

100
00:21:49,976 --> 00:21:52,229
Is that what you're asking me?

101
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:54,522
Is there something wrong with anything?

102
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:57,942
- Will there be anything else?
- You already asked me that.

103
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,781
Well, I need to see about closing now.

104
00:22:03,865 --> 00:22:05,534
- See about closing?
- Yes, sir.

105
00:22:05,616 --> 00:22:08,036
- What time do you close?
- Now. We close now.

106
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,204
"Now" is not a time.
What time do you close?

107
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:12,749
Generally around dark. At dark.

108
00:22:16,795 --> 00:22:18,838
You don't know
what you're talking about, do you?

109
00:22:18,922 --> 00:22:20,089
Sir?

110
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:24,635
I said you don't know
what you're talking about.

111
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:29,974
- What time do you go to bed?
- Sir?

112
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:34,144
You're a bit deaf, aren't you?
I said, what time do you go to bed?

113
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:41,778
Somewhere around 9:30.
I'd say around 9:30.

114
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:43,238
I could come back then.

115
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,699
Why would you be coming back?
We'll be closed.

116
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,450
Yeah, you said that.

117
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:50,537
Well, I got to close now.

118
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:52,998
You live in that house out back?

119
00:22:54,207 --> 00:22:56,041
Yes, I do.

120
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,044
You lived here all your life?

121
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:03,048
Well, this is my wife's
father's place, originally.

122
00:23:05,676 --> 00:23:07,470
You married into it?

123
00:23:07,554 --> 00:23:10,682
We lived in Temple, Texas
for many years.

124
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:15,144
Raised a family there, in Temple.

125
00:23:15,228 --> 00:23:17,771
We come out here about four years ago.

126
00:23:17,855 --> 00:23:19,691
You married into it.

127
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,442
If that's the way you want to put it.

128
00:23:21,526 --> 00:23:25,864
Well, I don't have some way to put it.
That's the way it is.

129
00:23:33,788 --> 00:23:37,375
What's the most you ever lost
on a coin toss?

130
00:23:37,459 --> 00:23:41,421
- Sir?
- The most you ever lost on a coin toss.

131
00:23:43,256 --> 00:23:46,009
I don't know. I couldn't say.

132
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:49,721
Call it.

133
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:51,681
- Call it?
- Yes.

134
00:23:51,765 --> 00:23:53,724
- For what?
- Just call it.

135
00:23:56,394 --> 00:24:00,065
Well, we need to know
what we're calling it for here.

136
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:01,566
You need to call it.

137
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:05,069
I can't call it for you,
or it wouldn't be fair.

138
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:08,615
- I didn't put nothing up.
- Yes, you did.

139
00:24:08,698 --> 00:24:12,868
You've been putting it up
your whole life. You just didn't know it.

140
00:24:12,952 --> 00:24:15,663
- You know what date is on this coin?
- No.

141
00:24:15,747 --> 00:24:17,539
1958.

142
00:24:17,624 --> 00:24:22,086
It's been travelling 22 years to get here.
And now it's here.

143
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,756
And it's either heads or tails.

144
00:24:24,838 --> 00:24:26,883
And you have to say. Call it.

145
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:30,053
Well, look, I need to know
what I stand to win.

146
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,512
Everything.

147
00:24:32,096 --> 00:24:35,557
- How's that?
- You stand to win everything. Call it.

148
00:24:39,729 --> 00:24:41,189
All right.

149
00:24:42,065 --> 00:24:43,525
Heads, then.

150
00:24:47,945 --> 00:24:49,405
Well done.

151
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:53,034
Don't put it in your pocket, sir.

152
00:24:53,117 --> 00:24:56,203
Don't put it in your pocket.
It's your lucky quarter.

153
00:24:56,954 --> 00:25:00,750
- Where do you want me to put it?
- Anywhere, not in your pocket.

154
00:25:00,834 --> 00:25:04,546
Or it'll get mixed in with the others
and become just a coin.

155
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:09,550
Which it is.

156
00:25:20,811 --> 00:25:22,188
Llewelyn?

157
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:26,442
What the hell?

158
00:25:27,736 --> 00:25:31,030
- The Odessa.
- Why would we go to Odessa?

159
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:34,409
No, not we. You.
You stay with your mother.

160
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:36,161
Well, how come?

161
00:25:36,243 --> 00:25:38,203
Look, right now it's midnight, Sunday.

162
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:40,123
The courthouse opens
nine hours from now.

163
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,086
Someone's gonna be calling in
the vehicle number

164
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:44,335
on the inspection plate on my truck.

165
00:25:44,419 --> 00:25:46,587
And around 9:30, they'll show up here.

166
00:25:46,671 --> 00:25:47,990
But for how long do we have to...

167
00:25:48,006 --> 00:25:49,507
Baby, at what point
would you quit bothering

168
00:25:49,590 --> 00:25:51,925
to look for your $2 million?

169
00:25:52,719 --> 00:25:54,971
What am I supposed to tell Mama?

170
00:25:55,055 --> 00:25:57,598
Why don't you try standing in the door
and hollering, "Mama, I'm home"?

171
00:25:57,682 --> 00:25:59,893
- Llewelyn...
- Come on, pack your things.

172
00:25:59,976 --> 00:26:02,854
Anything you leave,
you ain't gonna see again.

173
00:26:04,189 --> 00:26:07,817
Well, don't fall down apologising.

174
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:09,736
Baby, things happen-

175
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,280
Come on, I can't take them back.

176
00:26:36,054 --> 00:26:37,555
Mind riding bitch?

177
00:26:50,902 --> 00:26:52,862
This his truck?

178
00:26:57,032 --> 00:26:58,701
Got a screwgie?

179
00:27:01,954 --> 00:27:03,455
Who cut his tyres?

180
00:27:03,539 --> 00:27:06,291
Mexicans, I guess. Wasn't us.

181
00:27:07,544 --> 00:27:10,337
- That is a dead dog.
- Yes, it is.

182
00:27:13,883 --> 00:27:16,635
- Where's the receiver?
- I've got it.

183
00:27:17,428 --> 00:27:20,181
These are some ripe petunias.

184
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:22,808
Hold this, please.

185
00:27:30,567 --> 00:27:31,817
Want it?

186
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:36,155
You getting anything on this?

187
00:27:36,239 --> 00:27:37,615
Not a bleep.

188
00:27:38,407 --> 00:27:39,701
All right.

189
00:27:42,744 --> 00:27:44,247
Give me that.

190
00:27:54,257 --> 00:27:56,800
- I thought it was a car afire.
- It is a car afire.

191
00:27:56,884 --> 00:28:00,346
Wendell said there's something
in the back country, too.

192
00:28:00,430 --> 00:28:01,556
Step in there.

193
00:28:01,638 --> 00:28:04,224
When's the county gonna start
paying a rental on my horse?

194
00:28:04,308 --> 00:28:06,059
I love you more and more every day.

195
00:28:06,144 --> 00:28:08,020
That's very nice.

196
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,440
- Be careful.
- Always am.

197
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,442
- Don't get hurt.
- Never do.

198
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:14,027
Don't hurt no one.

199
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,573
If you say so.

200
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,484
Wouldn't think a car'd burn like that.

201
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:58,904
Yes, sir. We should've brought wienies.

202
00:28:58,988 --> 00:29:01,950
That look like about a '77 Ford
to you, Wendell?

203
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:05,244
- It could be.
- I'd say it is. Not a doubt in my mind.

204
00:29:05,327 --> 00:29:06,871
The old boy shot by the highway?

205
00:29:06,954 --> 00:29:09,249
Yes, sir. His vehicle.

206
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:14,586
Man killed Lamar's deputy, took his car,
killed that man on the highway,

207
00:29:14,671 --> 00:29:16,713
swapped for his car and now here it is,

208
00:29:16,798 --> 00:29:19,549
and he's swapped again
for God knows what.

209
00:29:20,218 --> 00:29:22,470
That's very linear, Sheriff.

210
00:29:23,637 --> 00:29:26,348
- Age'll flatten a man, Wendell.
- Yes, sir.

211
00:29:27,141 --> 00:29:29,434
- Then there's this other.
- Yup.

212
00:29:31,061 --> 00:29:32,814
You ride Winston.

213
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:35,692
- You sure?
- Oh, I'm more than sure.

214
00:29:35,775 --> 00:29:37,654
If anything happens
to Loretta's horse out here,

215
00:29:37,693 --> 00:29:40,947
I can tell you right now, I don't want
to be the party that was aboard.

216
00:29:41,864 --> 00:29:44,409
It's the same tyre tread
coming back as going.

217
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:45,993
Made about the same time, too.

218
00:29:46,076 --> 00:29:48,203
You can see the sipes real clear.

219
00:29:50,248 --> 00:29:53,835
Somebody's pried the inspection plate
off the door on this one.

220
00:29:55,336 --> 00:29:57,171
I know this truck.

221
00:29:58,131 --> 00:30:00,590
Belongs to a feller named Moss.

222
00:30:00,674 --> 00:30:03,051
- Llewelyn Moss?
- That's the boy.

223
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:06,806
- You figure him for a dope runner?
- I don't know.

224
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:09,099
I kindly doubt it.

225
00:30:09,182 --> 00:30:11,227
OK Corral's just yonder.

226
00:30:13,313 --> 00:30:16,190
Oh, hell's bells, they even shot the dog.

227
00:30:19,027 --> 00:30:21,570
Well, this is just a deal
gone wrong, isn't it?

228
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,155
Yup.

229
00:30:23,239 --> 00:30:25,700
Appears to have been a glitch or two.

230
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,079
What calibres you got there, Sheriff?

231
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,582
9 millimetre.

232
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:36,169
Couple of .45 ACPs.

233
00:30:37,127 --> 00:30:40,506
Somebody unloaded on that thing
with a shotgun.

234
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:45,094
How come you reckon
the coyotes ain't been at them?

235
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:46,554
I don't know.

236
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:55,063
Supposedly a coyote
won't eat a Mexican.

237
00:30:55,145 --> 00:30:57,356
These boys appear to be managerial.

238
00:30:58,398 --> 00:31:00,734
I think we're looking at
more than one fracas.

239
00:31:00,817 --> 00:31:03,653
Execution here. Wild west over there.

240
00:31:05,323 --> 00:31:07,407
It's that Mexican brown dope.

241
00:31:07,491 --> 00:31:09,743
Oh, these boys is all swole up.

242
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:12,872
So, this was earlier.
Getting set to trade.

243
00:31:12,954 --> 00:31:14,915
Then, whoa, differences and...

244
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:17,710
You know, might not even
have been no money.

245
00:31:17,794 --> 00:31:19,170
That's possible.

246
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,714
- But you don't believe it?
- No.

247
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:25,218
Probably I don't.

248
00:31:27,678 --> 00:31:30,390
Well, it's a mess, ain't it, Sheriff?

249
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:35,144
If it ain't, it'll do
till the mess gets here.

250
00:33:29,008 --> 00:33:30,384
Yes, sir?

251
00:33:30,968 --> 00:33:33,136
I'm looking for Llewelyn Moss.

252
00:33:33,221 --> 00:33:36,598
- Did you go up to his trailer?
- Yes, I did.

253
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:39,894
Well, I'd say he's at work.
Do you want to leave a message?

254
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:42,480
- Where does he work?
- I can't say.

255
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:46,317
Where does he work?

256
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:50,779
Sir, I ain't at liberty to give out
no information about our residents.

257
00:33:51,864 --> 00:33:53,740
Where does he work?

258
00:33:53,824 --> 00:33:56,117
Did you not hear me?

259
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:59,079
We can't give out no information.

260
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:22,936
Why all the way to Del Rio?

261
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:25,648
I'm gonna borrow a car from Roberto.

262
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:27,315
You can't afford one?

263
00:34:28,150 --> 00:34:31,403
I don't want to register it.
Look, I'll call you in a couple clays.

264
00:34:31,487 --> 00:34:33,364
- Promise?
- Yes, I do.

265
00:34:34,574 --> 00:34:36,199
I got a bad feeling, Llewelyn.

266
00:34:36,284 --> 00:34:39,494
Well, I got a good one,
so that ought to even out.

267
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:42,873
Listen, you gotta quit your worrying
so much.

268
00:34:42,956 --> 00:34:44,666
Mama's gonna raise hell.

269
00:34:45,251 --> 00:34:46,918
She's just gonna cuss you up and down.

270
00:34:47,003 --> 00:34:49,130
Well, you should be used to that.

271
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:52,048
I'm used to lots of things.
I work at Wal-Mart.

272
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:55,177
Not any more, Carla Jean.
You are retired.

273
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:58,264
- Llewelyn?
- Yes, ma'am?

274
00:34:59,974 --> 00:35:02,184
You are coming back, ain't you?

275
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,728
I shall return.

276
00:35:09,775 --> 00:35:11,527
Sheriff's Department!

277
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:15,364
Look at that lock.

278
00:35:17,992 --> 00:35:20,494
- We going in?
- Gun out and up.

279
00:35:24,373 --> 00:35:27,293
- What about yours?
- I'm hiding behind you.

280
00:35:30,378 --> 00:35:32,172
Sheriff's Department!

281
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:01,827
- I believe they done lit a shuck.
- I believe you're right.

282
00:36:01,911 --> 00:36:03,621
That from the lock?

283
00:36:03,704 --> 00:36:05,414
Probably must be.

284
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:08,333
- So, when was he here, Sheriff?
- I don't know.

285
00:36:09,460 --> 00:36:11,920
- Now that's aggravating.
- Sheriff?

286
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:13,672
Still sweating.

287
00:36:13,755 --> 00:36:16,842
Oh, Sheriff. We just missed him!

288
00:36:18,677 --> 00:36:21,347
We gotta circulate this on radio.

289
00:36:22,306 --> 00:36:23,807
All right.

290
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:26,393
But what do we circulate?

291
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:32,023
Looking for a man
who has recently drunk milk?

292
00:36:35,277 --> 00:36:37,822
Oh, Sheriff, that's aggravating.

293
00:36:37,905 --> 00:36:39,907
I'm ahead of you there.

294
00:36:42,076 --> 00:36:44,577
You think this boy Moss
has got any notion

295
00:36:44,661 --> 00:36:46,789
of the sorts of sons-of-bitches
that are hunting him?

296
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,833
I don't know. He ought to.

297
00:36:52,253 --> 00:36:53,753
He's seen the same things I've seen,

298
00:36:53,838 --> 00:36:56,005
and it certainly
made an impression on me.

299
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,389
Take me to a motel.

300
00:37:04,472 --> 00:37:06,891
- Got one in mind?
- Someplace cheap.

301
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:12,313
- You tell me the option.
- Do what, now?

302
00:37:12,398 --> 00:37:15,775
You pick the option
goes with the applicable rate.

303
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:21,239
I'm just one person,
so it don't matter the size of the bed.

304
00:37:26,911 --> 00:37:28,581
<i>This is Roberto's Automotive.</i>

305
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:31,166
<i>I'm not in right now.
Please leave a message.</i>

306
00:39:30,661 --> 00:39:32,036
<i>Hello?</i>

307
00:39:32,663 --> 00:39:34,373
ls Llewelyn there?

308
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:37,376
<i>Llewelyn? No, he ain't.</i>

309
00:39:38,168 --> 00:39:39,878
You expect him?

310
00:39:39,961 --> 00:39:43,382
<i>Now, why would I expect him?
Who is this?</i>

311
00:39:51,849 --> 00:39:53,016
May I help you?

312
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:56,228
Yeah, you got a pair of Larry Mahans,
shoulder, size 11?

313
00:39:56,311 --> 00:39:57,396
I'll check.

314
00:39:57,478 --> 00:39:59,773
- All right. Y'all sell socks?
- Just white.

315
00:39:59,856 --> 00:40:02,650
Well, White's all I wear. Bathroom?

316
00:40:28,552 --> 00:40:30,304
Don't stop.

317
00:40:30,387 --> 00:40:32,222
Just ride me up past those rooms.

318
00:40:32,306 --> 00:40:33,681
What room?

319
00:40:33,766 --> 00:40:37,561
Just drive me around.
I wanna see if someone's here.

320
00:40:45,777 --> 00:40:47,820
Keep going. Don't stop.

321
00:40:47,905 --> 00:40:50,907
I don't wanna get into
some kind of a jackpot here, buddy.

322
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:52,451
It's all right.

323
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:56,789
Why don't I just set you down right here
and we won't argue about it?

324
00:40:56,871 --> 00:40:59,833
- Take me to another motel.
- Let's just call it square.

325
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:03,003
Look, you're already in the jackpot,
and I'm trying to get you out of it.

326
00:41:03,086 --> 00:41:05,130
Take me to another motel.

327
00:41:54,554 --> 00:41:56,931
The lab reports from Austin
on that blood by the highway.

328
00:41:57,016 --> 00:41:59,726
- What was the bullet?
- There wasn't no bullet.

329
00:42:00,811 --> 00:42:04,188
- Wasn't no bullet?
- Yes, sir. Wasn't none.

330
00:42:04,273 --> 00:42:09,360
Well, Wendell, with all due respect,
that don't make a lot of sense.

331
00:42:09,445 --> 00:42:10,528
No, sir.

332
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:14,449
You said entry wound in the forehead,
no exit wound.

333
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:15,701
Yes, sir.

334
00:42:15,784 --> 00:42:17,411
You tell me he shot this boy in the head

335
00:42:17,494 --> 00:42:20,914
and then went digging around in there
with a pocket knife?

336
00:42:20,998 --> 00:42:23,916
- Well, sir, I don't wanna picture that.
- I don't, either.

337
00:42:24,001 --> 00:42:26,210
Can I freshen that there for you, Sheriff?

338
00:42:26,295 --> 00:42:28,880
Yeah, Maureen, you better had.

339
00:42:28,963 --> 00:42:32,550
Rangers and the DEA are headed back
out to the scene this morning.

340
00:42:32,634 --> 00:42:34,135
You gonna join 'em?

341
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:37,222
Any new bodies accumulate out there?

342
00:42:38,766 --> 00:42:41,768
- No, sir.
- Well, then I guess I can skip it.

343
00:42:56,282 --> 00:42:58,494
12 gauge. Need shells?

344
00:42:58,577 --> 00:43:00,621
Yeah, double-ought.

345
00:43:00,704 --> 00:43:02,623
Yeah, that'll give you a wallop.

346
00:43:02,706 --> 00:43:04,541
Y'all got camping supplies?

347
00:43:04,625 --> 00:43:06,585
Tent poles.

348
00:43:06,668 --> 00:43:09,630
- You already have the tent?
- Well, something like that.

349
00:43:09,713 --> 00:43:12,507
Well, you give me the model number
on the tent, I can order you the poles.

350
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:15,802
- Oh, never mind. I want a tent.
- Well, what kind of tent?

351
00:43:15,885 --> 00:43:17,012
The kind with most poles.

352
00:43:39,451 --> 00:43:42,371
- Could I get another room?
- You wanna change rooms?

353
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:44,914
No, ma'am, I wanna keep my room
and get another one.

354
00:43:44,998 --> 00:43:47,458
- Another additional?
- Yes, ma'am.

355
00:43:47,543 --> 00:43:49,961
And do you have a map of the rooms?

356
00:43:50,045 --> 00:43:52,922
Well, yeah, we had a sort of one.

357
00:43:54,507 --> 00:43:56,135
Oh, thank you.

358
00:43:59,972 --> 00:44:02,014
How about 38?

359
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:05,811
Well, you can have the one right next
to yours if you want, number 137.

360
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,771
- It ain't took.
- No, 38 will be fine.

361
00:44:08,856 --> 00:44:10,648
That's got two double beds.

362
00:50:46,293 --> 00:50:48,170
How'd you find that?

363
00:52:35,070 --> 00:52:37,447
You shouldn't be doing that.

364
00:52:38,030 --> 00:52:40,367
Even a young man like you.

365
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:42,994
Doing what?

366
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:45,579
Hitchhiking.

367
00:52:51,126 --> 00:52:52,670
Dangerous.

368
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:14,358
You know Anton Chigurh by sight,
is that correct?

369
00:53:14,442 --> 00:53:17,027
Yes, sir, I know him every which way.

370
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:20,030
When did you last see him?

371
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:24,494
November 28th, last year.

372
00:53:25,369 --> 00:53:28,539
Seem pretty sure of the date.
Did I ask you to sit?

373
00:53:29,206 --> 00:53:33,460
No, sir, but you struck me as a man
who wouldn't wanna waste a chair.

374
00:53:33,545 --> 00:53:38,550
I remember dates, names, numbers.
I saw him November the 28th.

375
00:53:41,094 --> 00:53:42,929
Got a loose cannon here.

376
00:53:43,012 --> 00:53:46,181
We're out a bunch of money,
and the other party is out his product.

377
00:53:46,266 --> 00:53:47,434
Yes, sir.

378
00:53:47,516 --> 00:53:52,063
This account will only give up $1,200
in any 24-hour period.

379
00:53:52,146 --> 00:53:53,981
That's up from $1,000.

380
00:53:54,065 --> 00:53:57,860
If your expenses run higher,
I hope you'll trust us for it.

381
00:53:57,943 --> 00:53:59,237
Okay.

382
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:03,742
- Just how well do you know Chigurh?
- What do you wanna know?

383
00:54:03,824 --> 00:54:07,161
I just wanna know
your opinion of him, in general.

384
00:54:07,871 --> 00:54:10,331
Just how dangerous is he?

385
00:54:10,414 --> 00:54:13,418
Compared to what, the bubonic plague?

386
00:54:13,501 --> 00:54:15,628
He's bad enough you called me.

387
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:19,798
Yeah, he's a psychopathic killer,
but so what?

388
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:22,010
There's plenty of them around.

389
00:54:22,092 --> 00:54:24,721
Killed three men
in a Del Rio motel yesterday,

390
00:54:24,804 --> 00:54:28,766
and two others in that
colossal goat fuck out in the desert.

391
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:31,894
- We can stop that.
- Seem pretty sure of yourself.

392
00:54:33,896 --> 00:54:38,150
You've led something of a charmed life,
haven't you, Mr Wells?

393
00:54:38,233 --> 00:54:43,114
In all honesty, I can't say that charm
has had a whole lot to do with it.

394
00:54:45,157 --> 00:54:47,659
- I was wondering...
- Yes?

395
00:54:48,536 --> 00:54:51,039
Could you validate my parking ticket?

396
00:54:53,166 --> 00:54:55,960
An attempt at humour, I suppose?

397
00:54:56,043 --> 00:54:57,461
I'm sorry.

398
00:55:02,175 --> 00:55:06,804
You know, I counted the floors
to this building from the street.

399
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:09,974
- And?
- There's one missing.

400
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:14,728
We'll look into it.

401
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:37,710
One room. One night.

402
00:55:37,793 --> 00:55:40,045
That'll be $26.

403
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:41,463
All righty.

404
00:55:45,385 --> 00:55:46,802
You on all night?

405
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:50,056
Yes, sir, I'll be right here
till 10:00 in the morning.

406
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:53,016
This here's for you.

407
00:55:53,101 --> 00:55:55,978
Now, I ain't asking you
to do anything illegal.

408
00:55:56,061 --> 00:55:57,856
There's someone
who been looking for me.

409
00:55:57,938 --> 00:55:59,315
Not police.

410
00:55:59,398 --> 00:56:01,860
You just call me
if anyone else checks in tonight.

411
00:56:01,943 --> 00:56:04,027
And by anyone,
I mean any swinging dick.

412
00:56:46,612 --> 00:56:48,655
There just ain't no way.

413
01:02:26,369 --> 01:02:29,246
Don't worry, I ain't gonna hurt you.

414
01:02:29,329 --> 01:02:31,706
I need you to drive me on out of here.

415
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:40,353
- Why not?
- I don't know, man.

416
01:05:40,438 --> 01:05:43,023
Could you have stayed...

417
01:06:04,210 --> 01:06:06,297
Were you in a car accident?

418
01:06:07,882 --> 01:06:10,550
I'll give you 500 bucks for that coat.

419
01:06:12,219 --> 01:06:14,054
Let me see the money.

420
01:06:16,097 --> 01:06:18,057
Were you in a car accident?

421
01:06:19,851 --> 01:06:21,144
Yeah.

422
01:06:21,228 --> 01:06:24,648
- Okay, give me the money.
- It's right here. Give me the clothes.

423
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:26,775
Let him hold the money.

424
01:06:33,407 --> 01:06:35,117
Now give it here.

425
01:06:42,750 --> 01:06:44,751
Give me that beer, too.

426
01:06:46,711 --> 01:06:48,005
How much?

427
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:50,965
Brian, give him the beer.

428
01:11:10,975 --> 01:11:12,394
Just went up.

429
01:13:10,970 --> 01:13:13,472
Any word on those vehicles yet?

430
01:13:13,556 --> 01:13:16,435
Sheriff, I found out everything
there was to find.

431
01:13:16,518 --> 01:13:20,146
Those vehicles are titled
and registered to deceased people.

432
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:23,399
The owner of that Bronco's
been dead 20 years.

433
01:13:23,483 --> 01:13:25,819
Do you want me to see what
I can find out about the Mexican ones?

434
01:13:25,903 --> 01:13:27,654
No. Lord, no.

435
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:30,823
There's this month's cheques.

436
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:34,493
That DEA agent called again.
You don't wanna talk to him?

437
01:13:34,578 --> 01:13:37,204
Gonna try to keep from it much as I can.

438
01:13:37,288 --> 01:13:38,664
He's going back out there.

439
01:13:38,748 --> 01:13:40,292
Wanted to know
if you wanted to go with him.

440
01:13:40,375 --> 01:13:42,002
That's cordial of him.

441
01:13:42,961 --> 01:13:44,755
Can I get you to call Loretta for me,

442
01:13:44,837 --> 01:13:47,673
tell her I'm going to Odessa
to see Carla Jean Moss?

443
01:13:47,757 --> 01:13:49,051
Yes, Sheriff.

444
01:13:49,134 --> 01:13:50,969
I'll call her when I get done.

445
01:13:51,052 --> 01:13:53,889
I'd call her now, but if she want me
to come home, I just might.

446
01:13:53,971 --> 01:13:56,891
Do you want me to wait
till you quit the building?

447
01:13:57,475 --> 01:14:00,854
You don't wanna lie without
what it's absolutely necessary.

448
01:14:04,024 --> 01:14:07,277
What is it Torbert says
about truth and justice?

449
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:11,238
Oh, we dedicate ourselves daily anew.
Something like that.

450
01:14:11,323 --> 01:14:14,158
I'm gonna commence
dedicating myself twice daily.

451
01:14:14,242 --> 01:14:17,328
Might come to three times
before it's over with.

452
01:14:18,537 --> 01:14:20,289
Now, what the hell?

453
01:14:28,381 --> 01:14:29,716
Sheriff?

454
01:14:30,884 --> 01:14:32,927
You looked at your load lately?

455
01:14:34,304 --> 01:14:36,264
That is a damn outrage.

456
01:14:37,140 --> 01:14:38,891
One of those tie-downs worked loose.

457
01:14:38,975 --> 01:14:41,019
How many bodies did you leave with?

458
01:14:41,103 --> 01:14:43,396
I ain't lost none of 'em, Sheriff.

459
01:14:44,189 --> 01:14:46,649
Couldn't y'all have taken
a van out there?

460
01:14:46,733 --> 01:14:49,152
We didn't have no van
with four-wheel drive.

461
01:14:49,235 --> 01:14:51,697
You gonna write me up
for improperly secured load on me?

462
01:14:51,779 --> 01:14:53,698
You get your ass out of here.

463
01:15:00,622 --> 01:15:03,667
I'm guessing this isn't the future
you had pictured for yourself

464
01:15:03,750 --> 01:15:06,377
when you first clapped eyes
on that money.

465
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:10,006
Don't worry.
I'm not the man who's after you.

466
01:15:11,007 --> 01:15:12,426
I know that.

467
01:15:14,427 --> 01:15:15,886
I've seen him.

468
01:15:15,970 --> 01:15:18,974
You've seen him? And you're not dead?

469
01:15:21,560 --> 01:15:23,979
What's this guy supposed to be,
the ultimate badass?

470
01:15:24,061 --> 01:15:25,939
I don't think that's how I'd describe him.

471
01:15:26,023 --> 01:15:28,149
How would you describe him?

472
01:15:28,233 --> 01:15:32,487
I guess I'd say
he doesn't have a sense of humour.

473
01:15:32,570 --> 01:15:34,197
His name's Chigurh.

474
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:37,743
- Sugar?
- Chigurh. Anton Chigurh.

475
01:15:37,826 --> 01:15:40,953
- You know how he found you?
- Yeah, I know how he found me.

476
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:44,248
- It's called a transponder.
- I know what it's called.

477
01:15:44,332 --> 01:15:46,001
He won't find me again.

478
01:15:46,083 --> 01:15:48,211
- Not that way.
- Not any way.

479
01:15:48,295 --> 01:15:50,171
Took me about three hours.

480
01:15:50,255 --> 01:15:51,672
Yeah, well, I been immobile.

481
01:15:51,756 --> 01:15:54,509
No. You don't understand.

482
01:15:57,011 --> 01:15:58,305
What do you do?

483
01:15:59,221 --> 01:16:00,347
I'm retired.

484
01:16:00,431 --> 01:16:02,934
- What did you do?
- Welder.

485
01:16:03,018 --> 01:16:04,560
Acetylene? Mig? Tig?

486
01:16:04,644 --> 01:16:06,896
Any of it.
If it can be welded, I can weld it.

487
01:16:06,979 --> 01:16:08,856
- Cast iron?
- Yeah.

488
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:11,275
- I don't mean braze.
- I didn't say braze.

489
01:16:11,359 --> 01:16:13,487
- Pot metal?
- What did I say?

490
01:16:15,113 --> 01:16:16,823
Were you in Nam?

491
01:16:18,283 --> 01:16:20,034
Yeah, I was in Nam.

492
01:16:21,619 --> 01:16:22,953
So was I.

493
01:16:23,704 --> 01:16:26,041
<i>So what does that make me,
your buddy?</i>

494
01:16:27,708 --> 01:16:30,337
Look, you gotta give me this money.

495
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:33,006
I got no other reason to protect you.

496
01:16:33,798 --> 01:16:36,217
It's too late. I spent it.

497
01:16:37,802 --> 01:16:39,887
About a million-and-a-half
on whores and whisky,

498
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:42,724
and the rest of it, I
just sort of blew it in.

499
01:16:44,768 --> 01:16:47,479
How do you know
he's not on his way to Odessa?

500
01:16:51,483 --> 01:16:53,318
Why would he go to Odessa?

501
01:16:54,235 --> 01:16:55,654
Kill your wife.

502
01:17:02,743 --> 01:17:07,082
Maybe he's the one
who needs to be worried about me.

503
01:17:07,164 --> 01:17:08,750
He isn't.

504
01:17:09,251 --> 01:17:10,417
Yeah.

505
01:17:10,502 --> 01:17:12,420
You're not cut out for this.

506
01:17:12,503 --> 01:17:16,341
You're just a guy
who happened to find those vehicles.

507
01:17:22,055 --> 01:17:25,015
I'm across the river at the Hotel Eagle.

508
01:17:25,100 --> 01:17:26,810
Carson Wells.

509
01:17:27,726 --> 01:17:29,563
Call me when you've had enough.

510
01:17:29,645 --> 01:17:32,649
I can even let you
keep a little of the money.

511
01:17:32,731 --> 01:17:36,278
If I was into cutting deals, why wouldn't
I just deal with this guy Sugar?

512
01:17:36,360 --> 01:17:40,698
Oh, no, no, you don't understand.
You can't make a deal with him.

513
01:17:40,782 --> 01:17:42,324
Even if you gave him the money back,

514
01:17:42,408 --> 01:17:45,996
he'd still kill you
just for inconveniencing him.

515
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:47,831
He's a peculiar man.

516
01:17:47,913 --> 01:17:49,748
Might even say he has principles.

517
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:54,503
Principles that transcend money
or drugs or anything like that.

518
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:56,922
Not like you.

519
01:17:57,631 --> 01:18:00,385
Yeah. He's not even like me.

520
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:04,139
No, he don't talk as much as you.
I give him points for that.

521
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:08,768
Carla Jean, thank you for coming.

522
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:13,480
Don't know why I did.
I told you, I don't know where he is.

523
01:18:13,564 --> 01:18:15,900
- You haven't heard from him?
- No, I ain't.

524
01:18:15,984 --> 01:18:17,819
- Nothing?
- Not word one.

525
01:18:17,903 --> 01:18:19,529
Would you tell me if you had?

526
01:18:19,613 --> 01:18:21,907
Well, I don't know.

527
01:18:22,908 --> 01:18:27,037
- He don't need any trouble from you.
- It ain't me he's in trouble with.

528
01:18:27,119 --> 01:18:30,289
- Who's he in trouble with, then?
- Some pretty bad people.

529
01:18:31,248 --> 01:18:34,502
These people will kill him, Carla Jean.
They won't quit.

530
01:18:34,586 --> 01:18:37,505
He won't, neither. He never has.

531
01:18:38,256 --> 01:18:40,175
He can take all comers.

532
01:18:43,302 --> 01:18:46,890
You know Charlie Walser's got
that place out east of Sanderson?

533
01:18:48,725 --> 01:18:51,228
Well, you know how he used
to slaughter beeves,

534
01:18:51,310 --> 01:18:54,980
hit 'em right there with a maul,
truss 'em up and slit their throats?

535
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:57,859
You know, Charlie's got one
all trussed up, all set to drain him,

536
01:18:57,943 --> 01:19:01,195
and the beef comes to,
starts thrashing around.

537
01:19:01,279 --> 01:19:03,823
Six hundred pounds
of very pissed off livestock.

538
01:19:03,907 --> 01:19:06,451
You'll excuse the... Well.

539
01:19:06,533 --> 01:19:09,119
Charlie grabs a gun there,
shoot the damn thing in the head,

540
01:19:09,203 --> 01:19:12,039
but with all the swinging
and the thrashing, it's a glance shot.

541
01:19:12,122 --> 01:19:15,001
Ricochets around, comes back,
hits Charlie in the shoulder.

542
01:19:15,085 --> 01:19:19,088
You go see Charlie, he still can't pick up
his right hand for his hat.

543
01:19:19,171 --> 01:19:22,967
The point being that even in the contest
between man and steer,

544
01:19:23,051 --> 01:19:24,802
the issue is not certain.

545
01:19:32,685 --> 01:19:36,939
When Llewelyn calls,
just tell him I'd make him safe.

546
01:19:41,944 --> 01:19:45,739
Course, they slaughter steers
a lot different these days.

547
01:19:45,823 --> 01:19:47,492
Use a air gun.

548
01:19:47,574 --> 01:19:49,953
Shoots out a little rod
about that far into the brain.

549
01:19:50,036 --> 01:19:53,206
Sucks right back in.
Animal never knows what hit him.

550
01:19:56,251 --> 01:19:59,753
- Why are you telling me that, Sheriff?
- I don't know.

551
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:05,092
My mind wanders.

552
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:30,302
Hello, Carson.

553
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:34,431
Let's go to your room.

554
01:21:46,944 --> 01:21:49,363
You don't have to do this.

555
01:21:49,447 --> 01:21:51,949
I'm a day trader.

556
01:21:52,033 --> 01:21:53,909
I could just go home.

557
01:21:55,412 --> 01:21:56,621
You could.

558
01:21:56,703 --> 01:22:00,250
Make it worth your while,
take you to an ATM

559
01:22:00,332 --> 01:22:02,668
with 14 grand in it.

560
01:22:02,752 --> 01:22:05,171
And everybody just walks away.

561
01:22:06,506 --> 01:22:07,923
An ATM?

562
01:22:12,720 --> 01:22:15,597
I know where the satchel is.

563
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:18,059
If you knew, you would have it with you.

564
01:22:18,143 --> 01:22:21,895
I can find it from the river bank.
I know where it is.

565
01:22:23,523 --> 01:22:25,692
I know something better.

566
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:28,444
- What's that?
- I know where it's going to be.

567
01:22:29,654 --> 01:22:30,988
Where's that?

568
01:22:31,072 --> 01:22:33,158
It will be brought to me,

569
01:22:34,033 --> 01:22:35,909
and placed at my feet.

570
01:22:37,744 --> 01:22:39,872
You don't know to a certainty.

571
01:22:40,707 --> 01:22:42,625
In 20 minutes it could be here.

572
01:22:42,708 --> 01:22:44,627
I do know to a certainty.

573
01:22:44,711 --> 01:22:47,671
And you know
what's gonna happen now, Carson?

574
01:22:48,381 --> 01:22:50,925
You should admit your situation.

575
01:22:51,009 --> 01:22:53,386
There would be more dignity in it.

576
01:22:58,224 --> 01:22:59,559
You go to hell.

577
01:23:01,978 --> 01:23:04,646
All right. Let me ask you something.

578
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:09,735
If the rule you followed

579
01:23:09,819 --> 01:23:11,613
brought you to this,

580
01:23:12,529 --> 01:23:14,657
of what use was the rule?

581
01:23:20,078 --> 01:23:23,707
Do you have any idea
how crazy you are?

582
01:23:25,292 --> 01:23:27,628
You mean the nature
of this conversation?

583
01:23:27,712 --> 01:23:29,756
I mean the nature of you.

584
01:23:33,926 --> 01:23:35,136
You...

585
01:23:36,429 --> 01:23:39,681
You can have the money, Anton.

586
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:21,765
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Yes?

587
01:24:24,185 --> 01:24:26,645
<i>Is Carson Wells there?</i>

588
01:24:29,399 --> 01:24:31,818
Not in the sense that you mean.

589
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:36,197
<i>You need to come see me.</i>

590
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,739
Who is this?

591
01:24:38,198 --> 01:24:39,908
You know who it is.

592
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:42,828
You need to talk to me.

593
01:24:42,912 --> 01:24:45,957
<i>- I don't need to talk to you.</i>
- I think you do.

594
01:24:46,873 --> 01:24:48,792
Do you know where I'm going?

595
01:24:49,377 --> 01:24:51,462
Why would I care where you're going?

596
01:24:51,546 --> 01:24:53,381
I know where you are.

597
01:24:54,131 --> 01:24:55,675
<i>Yeah? Where am I?</i>

598
01:24:56,259 --> 01:25:00,596
You're in the hospital across the river,
but that's not where I'm going.

599
01:25:01,514 --> 01:25:03,390
Do you know where I'm going?

600
01:25:05,518 --> 01:25:07,145
<i>Yeah, I know where you're going.</i>

601
01:25:07,228 --> 01:25:08,520
All right.

602
01:25:09,521 --> 01:25:10,939
<i>You know she won't be there.</i>

603
01:25:11,024 --> 01:25:13,609
It doesn't make any difference
where she is.

604
01:25:13,693 --> 01:25:15,903
So, what're you going up there for?

605
01:25:19,532 --> 01:25:22,284
You know how this is gonna turn out,
don't you?

606
01:25:24,037 --> 01:25:25,246
Nope.

607
01:25:26,163 --> 01:25:27,957
I think you do.

608
01:25:28,041 --> 01:25:30,001
So, this is what I'll offer.

609
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:33,546
You bring me the money
and I'll let her go.

610
01:25:34,380 --> 01:25:37,841
<i>Otherwise, she's accountable,
the same as you.</i>

611
01:25:40,386 --> 01:25:42,512
That's the best deal you're gonna get.

612
01:25:42,596 --> 01:25:46,434
I won't tell you you can save yourself,
because you can't.

613
01:25:49,936 --> 01:25:52,689
Yeah, I'm gonna bring you something,
all right.

614
01:25:53,524 --> 01:25:55,525
I've decided to make you
a special project of mine.

615
01:25:55,609 --> 01:25:58,445
You ain't gonna have to come
look for me at all.

616
01:26:02,699 --> 01:26:05,161
- The motel in Del Rio?
- Yes, sir.

617
01:26:05,243 --> 01:26:07,037
None of the three had ID on them,

618
01:26:07,121 --> 01:26:09,373
but they're telling me
that all three is Mexicans.

619
01:26:09,457 --> 01:26:10,792
Was Mexicans.

620
01:26:10,875 --> 01:26:15,128
There's a question,
whether they stopped being and when.

621
01:26:17,881 --> 01:26:19,384
Yes, sir.

622
01:26:19,759 --> 01:26:22,220
Now, Wendell, did you inquire
about the lock cylinder?

623
01:26:22,302 --> 01:26:24,221
Yes, sir. It was punched out.

624
01:26:24,305 --> 01:26:25,430
Okay.

625
01:26:26,474 --> 01:26:27,600
You wanna drive out there?

626
01:26:27,684 --> 01:26:29,043
Naw, that's all I had to look for,

627
01:26:29,060 --> 01:26:31,729
and it sound like these old boys
died of natural causes.

628
01:26:31,813 --> 01:26:34,899
- How's that, Sheriff?
- Natural to the line of work they was in.

629
01:26:34,981 --> 01:26:36,149
Yes, sir.

630
01:26:36,234 --> 01:26:40,113
My God, Wendell, it's just all-out war.
I can't think of any other word for it.

631
01:26:40,195 --> 01:26:42,532
Who are these people?

632
01:26:42,614 --> 01:26:46,159
Here, last week, they found
this couple out in California.

633
01:26:46,243 --> 01:26:49,997
They rent out rooms to old people,
kill them, bury them in the yard,

634
01:26:50,081 --> 01:26:52,332
cash their Social Security cheques.

635
01:26:53,333 --> 01:26:56,546
They'd torture them first.
I don't know why.

636
01:26:57,755 --> 01:27:00,091
Maybe their television set was broke.

637
01:27:00,675 --> 01:27:03,386
And this went on until... Here, I quote.

638
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:06,930
"Neighbours were alerted
when a man ran from the premises"

639
01:27:07,014 --> 01:27:08,932
"wearing only a dog collar."

640
01:27:10,976 --> 01:27:14,646
You can't make up such a thing as that.
I dare you to even try.

641
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:18,067
But that's what it took, you notice,
to get somebody's attention.

642
01:27:18,150 --> 01:27:21,112
Digging graves in the backyard
didn't bring any.

643
01:27:27,284 --> 01:27:30,328
Well, that's all right.
I laugh myself sometimes.

644
01:27:33,123 --> 01:27:35,417
Ain't a whole lot else you can do.

645
01:27:37,712 --> 01:27:39,713
Tell me something.

646
01:27:39,796 --> 01:27:43,967
Who do you think gets through this gate
into the United States of America?

647
01:27:44,635 --> 01:27:48,639
- I don't know. American citizens?
- Some American citizens.

648
01:27:48,722 --> 01:27:50,807
- Who do you think decides?
- You do, I reckon.

649
01:27:50,891 --> 01:27:54,020
That is correct. How do I decide?

650
01:27:54,103 --> 01:27:56,021
- I don't know.
- I ask questions.

651
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:58,440
And if I get sensible answers,
then they get to go to America.

652
01:27:58,524 --> 01:28:00,067
And if I don't get sensible answers,
they don't.

653
01:28:00,150 --> 01:28:01,652
Anything about that
you don't understand?

654
01:28:01,735 --> 01:28:03,112
- No, sir.
- Then I ask you again,

655
01:28:03,195 --> 01:28:05,823
how you come to be out here
with no clothes?

656
01:28:06,532 --> 01:28:08,367
Well, I got an overcoat on.

657
01:28:09,327 --> 01:28:10,926
- Are you jacking with me?
- Oh, no, sir.

658
01:28:10,994 --> 01:28:12,997
- Don't jack with me.
- Yes, sir.

659
01:28:13,747 --> 01:28:16,000
- You in the service?
- No, sir, I'm a veteran.

660
01:28:16,082 --> 01:28:18,502
- Nam?
- Yes, sir, two tours.

661
01:28:18,586 --> 01:28:19,712
What outfit?

662
01:28:19,796 --> 01:28:25,176
Twelfth Infantry Battalion,
August 7, 1966, July 2, 1968.

663
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:29,346
- Wilson.
- Yes, sir?

664
01:28:31,224 --> 01:28:34,100
Get someone to help this man.
He needs to get into town.

665
01:28:43,109 --> 01:28:45,279
How those Larry's holding up?

666
01:28:45,363 --> 01:28:48,533
- Good, good. I need everything else.
- Okay.

667
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:52,828
You have a lot of people come in here
without any clothes on?

668
01:28:52,912 --> 01:28:54,997
No, sir. It's unusual.

669
01:29:08,970 --> 01:29:11,639
<i>- She don't want to talk to you.</i>
- Yes, she does. Put her on.

670
01:29:11,721 --> 01:29:14,225
<i>- Do you know what time it is?</i>
- I don't care what time it is,

671
01:29:14,307 --> 01:29:16,685
and don't you hang up this phone.

672
01:29:16,769 --> 01:29:20,230
<i>Discombobulated by
a no-account son-in-law.</i>

673
01:29:21,106 --> 01:29:22,984
- Llewelyn?
<i>- Hey, you.</i>

674
01:29:23,067 --> 01:29:24,819
What should I do?

675
01:29:24,902 --> 01:29:26,153
<i>You know what's going on?</i>

676
01:29:26,237 --> 01:29:29,907
I don't know. I had the sheriff here
from Terrell County.

677
01:29:29,990 --> 01:29:33,202
<i>- What'd you tell him?</i>
- What did I know to tell him?

678
01:29:34,203 --> 01:29:36,204
<i>You're hurt, ain't you?</i>

679
01:29:37,414 --> 01:29:39,583
What makes you say that?

680
01:29:39,667 --> 01:29:41,502
<i>I can hear it in your voice.</i>

681
01:29:41,586 --> 01:29:43,212
<i>There is falseness in his voice!</i>

682
01:29:43,296 --> 01:29:47,048
Well, look, I want you to meet me
at the Desert Sands Motel in El Paso.

683
01:29:47,132 --> 01:29:49,426
Because I'm gonna give you the money,
I'm gonna put you on a plane.

684
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:51,804
Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you
in the lurch.

685
01:29:51,887 --> 01:29:53,597
No, look, this works better.

686
01:29:53,680 --> 01:29:56,041
With you gone and I don't have
the money, he can't touch me,

687
01:29:56,100 --> 01:29:58,101
but I can sure touch him.

688
01:29:58,185 --> 01:30:00,770
And after I find him,
I'll come and join you.

689
01:30:00,854 --> 01:30:04,065
<i>Find who?
What am I supposed to do with Mother?</i>

690
01:30:04,149 --> 01:30:06,319
- She'll be all right.
<i>- She'll be all right?</i>

691
01:30:06,402 --> 01:30:08,863
<i>Be all right? I got the cancer!</i>

692
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:11,032
Ain't nobody gonna bother her.

693
01:30:45,524 --> 01:30:47,068
Who are you?

694
01:30:51,529 --> 01:30:53,157
- Me?
- Yes.

695
01:30:53,239 --> 01:30:54,533
Nobody.

696
01:30:55,743 --> 01:30:57,203
Accounting.

697
01:30:58,746 --> 01:31:01,164
He gave the Mexicans a receiver.

698
01:31:03,626 --> 01:31:04,961
He feels...

699
01:31:05,752 --> 01:31:07,505
He felt that

700
01:31:08,005 --> 01:31:10,925
- the more people looking...
- That's foolish.

701
01:31:11,007 --> 01:31:13,301
You pick the one right tool.

702
01:31:14,595 --> 01:31:15,805
I see.

703
01:31:18,599 --> 01:31:20,393
Are you going to shoot me?

704
01:31:26,564 --> 01:31:28,274
That depends.

705
01:31:30,778 --> 01:31:32,488
Do you see me?

706
01:31:35,323 --> 01:31:37,993
I always seen this is what it'd come to.

707
01:31:38,077 --> 01:31:40,371
Three years ago, I pre-visioned it.

708
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:42,163
It ain't even three years
we been married.

709
01:31:42,247 --> 01:31:46,918
Three years ago I said them very words.
"No" and "good."

710
01:31:47,002 --> 01:31:50,296
Here we are, 90 degree heat,

711
01:31:50,381 --> 01:31:53,341
I got the cancer and look at this,

712
01:31:53,426 --> 01:31:55,761
not even my home to go to.

713
01:31:56,679 --> 01:31:59,305
We're going to El Paso, Texas.

714
01:31:59,390 --> 01:32:02,475
You know how many people
I know in El Paso, Texas?

715
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:03,894
No, ma'am.

716
01:32:03,978 --> 01:32:05,729
That's how many.

717
01:32:14,738 --> 01:32:16,407
I didn't see my prednisone.

718
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:18,951
- I put it in, Mama.
- Well, I didn't see it.

719
01:32:19,034 --> 01:32:23,204
Well, I put it in that one.
You just set there.

720
01:32:23,288 --> 01:32:25,373
I'll get tickets and a cart for the bags.

721
01:32:25,457 --> 01:32:27,710
You need help with the bags, madam?

722
01:32:27,792 --> 01:32:31,546
Well, thank God, there is
one gentleman left in west Texas.

723
01:32:31,630 --> 01:32:34,466
Yes, thank you.
I am old and I am not well.

724
01:32:34,550 --> 01:32:36,092
Which bus are you taking?

725
01:32:36,176 --> 01:32:39,220
Going to El Paso, don't ask me why.

726
01:32:39,305 --> 01:32:42,015
It's not often you see a Mexican
in a suit.

727
01:32:42,099 --> 01:32:45,310
You go to El Paso? I know it.
Where are you staying?

728
01:32:46,311 --> 01:32:48,104
<i>Carla Jean, how are you?</i>

729
01:32:48,189 --> 01:32:52,109
Sheriff, was that a true story
about Charlie Walser?

730
01:32:52,193 --> 01:32:53,860
<i>Who's Charlie Walser?</i>

731
01:32:57,363 --> 01:32:59,449
True story.
I couldn't swear to every detail,

732
01:32:59,533 --> 01:33:01,952
but it's certainly true it is a story.

733
01:33:02,036 --> 01:33:03,162
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

734
01:33:03,244 --> 01:33:06,957
Sheriff, can you give me your word
on something?

735
01:33:07,041 --> 01:33:08,292
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

736
01:33:09,126 --> 01:33:12,087
If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed,

737
01:33:12,171 --> 01:33:15,423
you promise it'll be just you
who goes and talks with him?

738
01:33:15,507 --> 01:33:17,259
You and nobody else.

739
01:33:17,342 --> 01:33:19,011
Yes, ma'am, I do.

740
01:33:19,095 --> 01:33:20,805
<i>Llewelyn would never ask for help.</i>

741
01:33:21,846 --> 01:33:23,974
He never thinks he needs any.

742
01:33:24,057 --> 01:33:26,769
<i>Carla Jean, I will not harm your man.</i>

743
01:33:28,061 --> 01:33:31,189
<i>And he needs help,
whether he knows it or not.</i>

744
01:33:40,365 --> 01:33:42,493
Hey, what's the problem
there, neighbour?

745
01:33:42,576 --> 01:33:46,663
Yep, that'll suck some power, over time.

746
01:33:48,623 --> 01:33:50,208
You from around here?

747
01:33:50,292 --> 01:33:53,337
Yeah, Alpine, born and bred.
Here you go.

748
01:33:54,087 --> 01:33:56,631
What airport would you use?

749
01:33:56,715 --> 01:33:59,385
Well, airport or airstrip?

750
01:33:59,510 --> 01:34:01,011
Airport.

751
01:34:01,052 --> 01:34:04,849
- Well, where you going?
- I don't know.

752
01:34:04,890 --> 01:34:07,643
Just lighting out for the territories, huh?

753
01:34:07,725 --> 01:34:09,728
Brother, I been there.

754
01:34:09,811 --> 01:34:13,231
Well, there's airstrips.

755
01:34:13,314 --> 01:34:15,525
The airport is El Paso.

756
01:34:15,568 --> 01:34:17,319
If you want someplace specific,

757
01:34:17,403 --> 01:34:21,573
you might could be better off just driving
to Dallas, not have to connect.

758
01:34:22,198 --> 01:34:24,033
You gonna clamp them, buddy?

759
01:34:24,076 --> 01:34:27,037
Can you get those chicken crates
out of the bed?

760
01:34:27,829 --> 01:34:29,247
What are you talking about?

761
01:34:45,430 --> 01:34:49,350
Hey, Mr Sporting Goods.

762
01:34:49,601 --> 01:34:51,395
Hey, yourself.

763
01:34:51,436 --> 01:34:53,271
You a sport?

764
01:34:54,023 --> 01:34:55,940
Yeah, that's me.

765
01:34:56,024 --> 01:34:58,359
I got beers in my room.

766
01:34:58,444 --> 01:35:01,279
Oh, I'm waiting on my wife.

767
01:35:01,404 --> 01:35:05,451
Oh. That's who you keep
looking out the window for?

768
01:35:05,576 --> 01:35:06,784
Well, half.

769
01:35:07,286 --> 01:35:08,621
What else, then?

770
01:35:09,287 --> 01:35:11,789
Just looking for what's coming.

771
01:35:11,916 --> 01:35:15,127
Yeah. But no one ever sees that.

772
01:35:16,252 --> 01:35:19,465
Beer. That's what's coming.

773
01:35:19,547 --> 01:35:22,134
I'll bring the ice chest out here.
You can stay married.

774
01:35:22,259 --> 01:35:24,929
No, ma'am, I know what beer leads to.

775
01:35:26,639 --> 01:35:28,724
Beer leads to more beer.

776
01:36:15,688 --> 01:36:17,273
You all right?

777
01:36:22,485 --> 01:36:24,195
Call the police.

778
01:36:30,034 --> 01:36:32,203
Your local law enforcement.

779
01:36:33,997 --> 01:36:35,957
I'm not on their radio.

780
01:37:26,257 --> 01:37:29,386
Buy you a cup of coffee
before you drive home?

781
01:37:29,427 --> 01:37:30,720
No money in his room there?

782
01:37:30,762 --> 01:37:33,306
Couple hundred, on his person.

783
01:37:33,431 --> 01:37:35,809
Those hombres
would have taken the stash.

784
01:37:35,934 --> 01:37:37,935
I suppose so.

785
01:37:37,978 --> 01:37:40,271
Though they was leaving in a hurry.

786
01:37:40,314 --> 01:37:45,234
It's all the goddamn money, Ed Tom.
Money and the drugs.

787
01:37:46,737 --> 01:37:49,448
It's just goddamn beyond everything.

788
01:37:50,114 --> 01:37:53,409
What's it mean? What's it leading to?

789
01:37:53,452 --> 01:37:56,287
You know, if you'd have told me
20 years ago

790
01:37:56,412 --> 01:38:01,292
that I'd see children walking the streets
of our Texas towns with green hair,

791
01:38:01,417 --> 01:38:03,170
bones in their noses,

792
01:38:03,295 --> 01:38:05,463
I just flat-out
wouldn't have believed you.

793
01:38:05,506 --> 01:38:06,840
Signs and wonders.

794
01:38:06,965 --> 01:38:11,636
But I think once you quit hearing "sir"
and "ma'am," the rest is soon to follow.

795
01:38:11,677 --> 01:38:13,262
- Oh, it's the tide.
- Yeah.

796
01:38:13,305 --> 01:38:16,809
It's the dismal tide.
It is not the one thing.

797
01:38:16,934 --> 01:38:18,851
Not the one thing.

798
01:38:18,976 --> 01:38:21,939
Yeah, well, none of that
explains your man, though.

799
01:38:21,979 --> 01:38:25,024
He's just a goddamn
homicidal lunatic, Ed Tom.

800
01:38:25,149 --> 01:38:26,984
I'm not sure he's a lunatic.

801
01:38:27,027 --> 01:38:28,612
Yeah, well, what would you call him?

802
01:38:28,654 --> 01:38:32,032
Well, sometimes,
I think he's pretty much a ghost.

803
01:38:32,157 --> 01:38:34,118
- He's real, all right.
- Oh, yeah?

804
01:38:34,158 --> 01:38:36,662
Yeah.
All of that over at the Eagle Hotel?

805
01:38:36,787 --> 01:38:37,954
Just beyond everything.

806
01:38:37,996 --> 01:38:40,498
Yeah. Got some hard bark on him.

807
01:38:40,623 --> 01:38:43,377
Why, well, that don't hardly say it.

808
01:38:44,670 --> 01:38:46,505
He shoots a desk clerk one day,

809
01:38:46,630 --> 01:38:51,009
walks right back in the next
and shoots a retired army colonel.

810
01:38:51,051 --> 01:38:52,552
It's hard to believe.

811
01:38:52,677 --> 01:38:55,972
Just strolls right back
into a crime scene.

812
01:38:56,014 --> 01:38:57,850
Now, who'd do such a thing?

813
01:38:58,641 --> 01:39:00,685
How do you defend against it?

814
01:39:01,561 --> 01:39:06,358
Well, good trip, Ed Tom.
Sorry we couldn't help your boy.

815
01:42:39,195 --> 01:42:40,947
In back!

816
01:42:41,073 --> 01:42:42,615
How'd you know I was here?

817
01:42:42,740 --> 01:42:45,409
Who else'd be driving up in your truck?

818
01:42:45,452 --> 01:42:46,619
You heard it?

819
01:42:46,744 --> 01:42:49,038
- How's that?
- Did you hear my...

820
01:42:50,122 --> 01:42:51,625
You're having fun with me.

821
01:42:51,750 --> 01:42:55,587
What give you that idea?
I seen one of the cats heard it.

822
01:42:55,712 --> 01:42:57,922
How'd you know it was my truck?

823
01:42:58,047 --> 01:43:01,134
I deduced it when you walked in.

824
01:43:01,259 --> 01:43:02,927
How many of them things you got now?

825
01:43:02,969 --> 01:43:05,596
Cats? Oh, I don't know, several.

826
01:43:05,721 --> 01:43:08,934
Well, it depends on
what you mean by "got."

827
01:43:09,059 --> 01:43:12,813
Some of them are half wild,
some of them are just outlaws.

828
01:43:16,440 --> 01:43:18,109
How you been, Ellis?

829
01:43:18,944 --> 01:43:20,487
You're looking at it.

830
01:43:21,570 --> 01:43:24,740
I got to say, you're looking older.

831
01:43:24,783 --> 01:43:26,283
I am older.

832
01:43:27,618 --> 01:43:29,954
Got a letter from your wife.

833
01:43:29,996 --> 01:43:34,583
She writes me pretty regular,
keeps me up on the family news.

834
01:43:35,292 --> 01:43:38,337
- Didn't know there was any.
- Told me you're quitting.

835
01:43:41,298 --> 01:43:44,094
- You want a cup?
- Appreciate it.

836
01:43:51,810 --> 01:43:53,520
How fresh is that coffee?

837
01:43:53,645 --> 01:43:58,649
I generally make a fresh pot every week,
even if there's some left over.

838
01:44:01,319 --> 01:44:03,697
That man that shot you died in prison?

839
01:44:05,990 --> 01:44:08,159
Angola. Yeah.

840
01:44:08,284 --> 01:44:10,996
What'd you done,
he'd have been released?

841
01:44:11,121 --> 01:44:13,707
Oh, I don't know. Nothing.

842
01:44:14,332 --> 01:44:16,501
Wouldn't be no point in it.

843
01:44:16,626 --> 01:44:19,128
Kindly surprised to hear you say that.

844
01:44:19,171 --> 01:44:24,050
Well, all the time you spend trying to
get back what's been took from you,

845
01:44:24,176 --> 01:44:26,177
more is going out the door.

846
01:44:26,677 --> 01:44:30,724
After a while, you just have to try
to get a tourniquet on it.

847
01:44:30,849 --> 01:44:34,978
Your granddad never asked me
to sign on as a deputy.

848
01:44:37,689 --> 01:44:40,233
Loretta tells me you're quitting.

849
01:44:40,358 --> 01:44:43,194
- How come you doing that?
- I don't know.

850
01:44:46,989 --> 01:44:48,742
I feel overmatched.

851
01:44:53,162 --> 01:44:55,707
I always figured when I got older,

852
01:44:55,832 --> 01:45:00,212
God would sort of
come into my life somehow.

853
01:45:03,672 --> 01:45:05,216
And he didn't.

854
01:45:08,511 --> 01:45:10,221
I don't blame him.

855
01:45:12,556 --> 01:45:15,935
If I was him, I'd have the same opinion
of me that he does.

856
01:45:16,060 --> 01:45:18,063
You don't know what he thinks.

857
01:45:32,243 --> 01:45:36,081
I sent Uncle Mac's thumb buster
and badge over to the Rangers,

858
01:45:36,122 --> 01:45:38,082
put it in their museum.

859
01:45:38,750 --> 01:45:42,587
Your daddy ever tell you
how Uncle Mac come to his reward?

860
01:45:43,380 --> 01:45:47,259
Gunned down on his own porch
over in Hudspeth County.

861
01:45:49,219 --> 01:45:53,390
Seven or eight of them come up there,
all wanting this, wanting that.

862
01:45:54,431 --> 01:45:58,310
Uncle Mac went back in the house
to get the shotgun, well...

863
01:45:58,770 --> 01:46:00,729
They was ahead of him.

864
01:46:01,273 --> 01:46:03,399
Shot him in his doorway.

865
01:46:03,899 --> 01:46:06,403
Aunt Ella come out,
tried to stop the bleeding.

866
01:46:06,444 --> 01:46:10,155
Uncle Mac all the while
trying to get that shotgun.

867
01:46:10,282 --> 01:46:14,286
They just sat there on their horses,
watching him die.

868
01:46:15,828 --> 01:46:20,125
After a while one of them said
something in Indian and they turned,

869
01:46:20,958 --> 01:46:22,293
left out.

870
01:46:24,962 --> 01:46:28,341
Uncle Mac knew the score,
even if Aunt Ella didn't.

871
01:46:28,466 --> 01:46:30,635
Shot through the left lung.

872
01:46:32,136 --> 01:46:35,806
And that was that, as they say.

873
01:46:39,644 --> 01:46:41,020
When'd he die?

874
01:46:42,104 --> 01:46:45,317
1909.

875
01:46:45,442 --> 01:46:49,695
No, I mean, was it right away,
or in the night or...

876
01:46:49,820 --> 01:46:51,323
When was it?

877
01:46:51,363 --> 01:46:55,327
I believe it was that night.
She buried him the next morning.

878
01:46:55,368 --> 01:46:58,287
Digging in that hard old caliche.

879
01:47:01,332 --> 01:47:03,792
What you got ain't nothing new.

880
01:47:05,170 --> 01:47:07,505
This country is hard on people.

881
01:47:11,301 --> 01:47:13,552
You can't stop what's coming.

882
01:47:15,471 --> 01:47:17,390
It ain't all waiting on you.

883
01:47:20,393 --> 01:47:22,145
That's vanity.

884
01:48:23,247 --> 01:48:25,582
I knew this wasn't done with.

885
01:48:28,293 --> 01:48:30,255
I ain't got the money.

886
01:48:32,381 --> 01:48:36,761
What little I had is long gone
and there's bills aplenty to pay yet.

887
01:48:38,470 --> 01:48:40,806
I buried my mother today.

888
01:48:40,931 --> 01:48:43,059
Ain't paid for that, neither.

889
01:48:43,935 --> 01:48:45,936
I wouldn't worry about it.

890
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:50,149
I need to sit down.

891
01:49:05,331 --> 01:49:07,958
You got no cause to hurt me.

892
01:49:08,001 --> 01:49:11,296
No. But I gave my word.

893
01:49:12,796 --> 01:49:14,966
You gave your word?

894
01:49:15,091 --> 01:49:16,760
To your husband.

895
01:49:19,470 --> 01:49:21,346
That don't make sense.

896
01:49:22,306 --> 01:49:25,601
You gave your word
to my husband to kill me?

897
01:49:25,643 --> 01:49:29,021
Your husband had the opportunity
to save you.

898
01:49:29,146 --> 01:49:32,108
Instead he used you
to try to save himself.

899
01:49:37,154 --> 01:49:38,823
Not like that.

900
01:49:40,783 --> 01:49:42,659
Not like you say.

901
01:49:48,541 --> 01:49:50,335
You don't have to do this.

902
01:49:50,376 --> 01:49:52,628
People always say the same thing.

903
01:49:54,338 --> 01:49:55,798
What do they say?

904
01:49:56,632 --> 01:49:59,385
They say, "You don't have to do this."

905
01:50:00,136 --> 01:50:01,512
You don't.

906
01:50:04,015 --> 01:50:05,182
Okay.

907
01:50:10,313 --> 01:50:12,398
This is the best I can do.

908
01:50:13,399 --> 01:50:14,692
Call it.

909
01:50:19,029 --> 01:50:22,533
I knowed you was crazy
when I saw you sitting there.

910
01:50:24,993 --> 01:50:27,663
I knowed exactly
what was in store for me.

911
01:50:28,539 --> 01:50:30,542
- Call it.
- No.

912
01:50:32,668 --> 01:50:34,546
I ain't gonna call it.

913
01:50:37,923 --> 01:50:39,259
Call it.

914
01:50:39,384 --> 01:50:41,552
The coin don't have no say.

915
01:50:42,679 --> 01:50:44,221
It's just you.

916
01:50:47,057 --> 01:50:50,019
Well, I got here
the same way the coin did.

917
01:52:32,829 --> 01:52:36,042
Mister, you got a bone
sticking out of your arm.

918
01:52:36,167 --> 01:52:38,293
I'm all right.
Let me just sit here a minute.

919
01:52:38,336 --> 01:52:41,797
There's an ambulance coming.
The man over yonder went to call.

920
01:52:41,838 --> 01:52:43,216
All right.

921
01:52:43,800 --> 01:52:45,801
Are you all right?

922
01:52:45,842 --> 01:52:48,720
You got a bone sticking out your arm.

923
01:52:48,845 --> 01:52:51,015
What'll you take for the shirt?

924
01:52:55,353 --> 01:52:58,355
Well, hell, mister, I'll give you my shirt.

925
01:53:05,529 --> 01:53:07,823
Look at that fucking bone.

926
01:53:08,865 --> 01:53:10,243
Tie this for me.

927
01:53:11,159 --> 01:53:13,203
Just tie it, just tie it.

928
01:53:31,389 --> 01:53:35,018
Hell, mister.
Look, I don't mind helping someone out.

929
01:53:35,059 --> 01:53:37,520
- That's a lot of money.
- Take it.

930
01:53:37,561 --> 01:53:41,106
Take it and you didn't see me.

931
01:53:41,231 --> 01:53:43,192
I was already gone.

932
01:53:43,234 --> 01:53:44,444
Yes, sir.

933
01:53:49,073 --> 01:53:50,742
You know part of that's mine, right?

934
01:53:50,867 --> 01:53:52,409
You still got your damn shirt.

935
01:53:52,534 --> 01:53:54,037
Ain't even what it was for.

936
01:53:54,078 --> 01:53:56,747
Well, maybe. But I'm still out a shirt.

937
01:54:17,268 --> 01:54:19,645
- Maybe I'll go riding.
- Okay.

938
01:54:19,770 --> 01:54:21,104
What do you think?

939
01:54:21,229 --> 01:54:23,483
Well, I can't plan your day.

940
01:54:24,900 --> 01:54:28,945
- I mean, would you care to join me?
- Lord, no, I'm not retired.

941
01:54:30,573 --> 01:54:32,658
Maybe I'll help out here, then.

942
01:54:33,743 --> 01:54:35,161
Better not.

943
01:54:39,332 --> 01:54:42,835
- How'd you sleep?
- I don't know. Had dreams.

944
01:54:42,960 --> 01:54:46,588
Well, you got time for them now.
Anything interesting?

945
01:54:47,256 --> 01:54:50,009
They always is to the party concerned.

946
01:54:52,261 --> 01:54:54,680
Ed Tom, I'll be polite.

947
01:54:57,350 --> 01:55:00,353
All right, then. Two of them,
both had my father in them.

948
01:55:00,478 --> 01:55:02,479
It's peculiar.

949
01:55:02,521 --> 01:55:05,483
I'm older now than he ever was
by 20 years.

950
01:55:05,608 --> 01:55:09,654
So, in a sense, he's the younger man.

951
01:55:09,779 --> 01:55:12,657
Anyway, the first one
I don't remember too well,

952
01:55:13,658 --> 01:55:15,659
but it was about meeting him
in town somewheres

953
01:55:15,784 --> 01:55:17,828
and he give me some money.

954
01:55:17,953 --> 01:55:19,704
I think I lost it.

955
01:55:21,498 --> 01:55:26,671
The second one, it was like
we was both back in older times.

956
01:55:26,712 --> 01:55:30,507
And I was a-horseback
going through the mountains of a night.

957
01:55:30,550 --> 01:55:33,176
Going through this pass
in the mountains.

958
01:55:34,136 --> 01:55:37,347
It was cold
and there was snow on the ground.

959
01:55:37,390 --> 01:55:39,809
And he would...
Rode past me and kept on going.

960
01:55:39,850 --> 01:55:42,979
Never said nothing going by,
just rode on past.

961
01:55:43,020 --> 01:55:48,067
He had his blanket wrapped around him
and his head down.

962
01:55:50,194 --> 01:55:53,864
When he rode past,
I seen he was carrying fire in a horn,

963
01:55:53,905 --> 01:55:55,365
the way people used to do,

964
01:55:55,490 --> 01:55:58,703
and I could see the horn
from the light inside of it,

965
01:55:58,743 --> 01:56:00,829
about the colour of the moon.

966
01:56:02,164 --> 01:56:06,543
And in the dream,
I knew that he was going on ahead.

967
01:56:07,670 --> 01:56:09,212
And he was fixing to make a fire

968
01:56:09,337 --> 01:56:12,550
somewhere out there
in all that dark and all that cold.

969
01:56:16,095 --> 01:56:19,431
And I knew that whenever I got there,
he'd be there.

970
01:56:23,728 --> 01:56:25,229
Then I woke up.
