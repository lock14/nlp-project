1
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,551
<i>Let's call American
Express. You lost your card,</i>

2
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:27,717
<i>and you don't know
what the number of it is.</i>

3
00:00:27,827 --> 00:00:28,919
<i>That's
a great one.</i>

4
00:00:29,029 --> 00:00:30,018
<i>Do the old lady.</i>

5
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:32,325
<i>I lost my card.</i>

6
00:00:33,533 --> 00:00:35,398
<i>Your... Your accent went
in and out on you sometimes.</i>

7
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:36,764
<i>I went
southern and then...</i>

8
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:38,337
<i>American Express. I'm
Danille, how may I help you?</i>

9
00:00:38,438 --> 00:00:40,633
<i>I certainly need
some assistance.</i>

10
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:44,039
<i>I'm sorry to call you
in such a frenzy,</i>

11
00:00:44,144 --> 00:00:48,274
but I'm very shook up. I got
my American Express card stolen.

12
00:00:49,115 --> 00:00:51,083
<i>Okay, can I have
your last name, please?</i>

13
00:00:51,184 --> 00:00:52,151
Yes.

14
00:00:52,786 --> 00:00:53,946
<i>What's your last name?</i>

15
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:55,146
Right.

16
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:58,019
<i>Okay, can you give me your name
so I can look up your account?</i>

17
00:00:58,124 --> 00:00:59,148
Yes. Helen.

18
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:00,590
<i>What's your
last name, please?</i>

19
00:01:00,693 --> 00:01:01,887
Easafawn.

20
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:03,863
<i>What?</i>

21
00:01:05,031 --> 00:01:07,829
Helen Easafawn.

22
00:01:07,934 --> 00:01:10,494
E- A

23
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:15,868
S- A-fawn.

24
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,173
<i>Jerry's Famous Deli.
This is Cindy. May I help you?</i>

25
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:22,874
Hi. I have no legs.
May I speak to the manager?

26
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:31,488
Now, if I get a bill and
it's something, like, for...

27
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:41,566
But two times in a row I eat
the damn roast beef and I'm...

28
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:46,196
I can't stop
going to the bathroom!

29
00:01:46,306 --> 00:01:48,968
<i>Well, I'm sorry, but there's
nothing I can do for you.</i>

30
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:50,303
Ma?

31
00:01:51,077 --> 00:01:53,238
And my son
thinks I'm crazy.

32
00:01:53,346 --> 00:01:54,745
Ma, who you calling?

33
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:56,975
It's Jerry's. And don't
tell me not to call them.

34
00:01:57,083 --> 00:01:59,142
Jesus Christ, get off
the fucking phone!

35
00:01:59,252 --> 00:02:00,219
Don't talk
to me that way!

36
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,220
Get off the
fucking phone!

37
00:02:02,322 --> 00:02:03,289
What's going on?

38
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:04,651
<i>Same
thing as the last time.</i>

39
00:02:04,757 --> 00:02:06,019
Did she... What'd
she call you about?

40
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,286
<i>The roast beef?
Yes.</i>

41
00:02:07,393 --> 00:02:09,361
All right, she just
puked in the kitchen.

42
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,828
<i>That's all right. I suggested
that she doesn't eat roast beef</i>

43
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,831
<i>if it doesn't
agree with her.</i>

44
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:23,208
I... I appreciate your
suggestions, but I love roast beef.

45
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,799
It's delicious!

46
00:02:25,545 --> 00:02:26,978
Go clean
up the mess!

47
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,311
I can't.
Get off of me!

48
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:32,217
You son of a bitch!

49
00:03:17,997 --> 00:03:18,986
George?

50
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:26,932
Hi,
Mr. Simmons.

51
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,302
Ladies.

52
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:32,802
George Simmons, man!
Can I get a picture?

53
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:35,738
Yeah, yeah. You got it ready? All
right, hit me, baby, all right.

54
00:03:35,848 --> 00:03:37,679
Get a little tittie in there. Come on.

55
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:39,215
How are you?
You're really funny.

56
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,843
Thank you.
You're funnier.

57
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:44,749
Hello.
Hi!

58
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:46,381
Gentlemen. Gentlemen.
Hey, what's up?

59
00:03:46,492 --> 00:03:47,959
Hey.
How are you?

60
00:04:01,975 --> 00:04:03,465
Hey, handsome.
Doctor.

61
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:04,543
How are you, kid?

62
00:04:04,644 --> 00:04:05,611
How are you, baby?

63
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,937
The Lunestas
are working, baby.

64
00:04:09,048 --> 00:04:11,346
Those are smooth.
No hangover.

65
00:04:11,451 --> 00:04:16,081
Fall asleep, bam. Fucking what
was the deal with the Restorils?

66
00:04:16,189 --> 00:04:19,784
Why did you give me those? You
trying to fuck with me or something?

67
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:23,555
George, we got the results back from
the follow-up of your blood count

68
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:26,257
and it's not
what we hoped for.

69
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:29,995
As I mentioned earlier,
the CBC was abnormal.

70
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:34,904
Your white blood cells were four
times the size that they should be.

71
00:04:35,008 --> 00:04:38,774
And very low hemoglobin,
seven grams per deciliter.

72
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:40,937
I don't understand
what you're saying right now.

73
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:43,538
Can you speak
how people speak?

74
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:47,051
You have a very serious
disease. It's called AML.

75
00:04:47,153 --> 00:04:51,852
It's a form of leukemia and I can't
predict how this will play out,

76
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,553
but I feel you have
a rough road ahead of you.

77
00:05:01,934 --> 00:05:03,128
That's George Simmons,
right here.

78
00:05:03,236 --> 00:05:04,533
George! George!
George Simmons!

79
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,037
Hey, man! How, how you doing,
man? I'm a big fan of yours.

80
00:05:26,993 --> 00:05:31,259
I'm sorry to say we're past the
point where traditional structures

81
00:05:31,364 --> 00:05:35,027
like chemotherapy and radiation
would be effective at all.

82
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:39,729
<i>And I think it's best for us to
pursue an experimental course.</i>

83
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:46,610
Here you go, ma'am.
Your tamales.

84
00:05:46,713 --> 00:05:48,112
Thanks for shopping
at Otto's. Yo, Chuck,

85
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:50,840
I'm going up at the Comedy
& Magic Club doing stand-up.

86
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:52,144
You should
come watch me.

87
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,719
Don't let him suck
you in. He's not funny.

88
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:57,419
Nah, he's right, man. No way,
man. That shit was painful.

89
00:05:57,523 --> 00:05:59,514
I mean, it was hard
watching you suffer up there.

90
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,252
I had fucking
nightmares after that.

91
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:02,828
That was a long time ago.
That was months ago.

92
00:06:02,929 --> 00:06:04,089
I've gotten a lot
funnier since then.

93
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:05,323
Then you bored
my wife to sleep.

94
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:06,762
I couldn't get no pussy that night, man.

95
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,357
Don't blame me
for your pussy issues.

96
00:06:09,469 --> 00:06:10,959
Are they gonna pay you?
Pay me? No!

97
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:12,970
That's just how it starts. You
don't get paid in the beginning.

98
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:15,165
You gotta, you know, work
your way up through the ranks.

99
00:06:15,341 --> 00:06:17,138
My nigger, how the fuck
you in show business

100
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:18,642
when you got no
business to show?

101
00:06:18,745 --> 00:06:20,007
I'm supposed
to be writing jokes.

102
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:21,307
I'm supposed
to be doing comedy.

103
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:23,575
I'm not supposed to be
making macaroni salad.

104
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:26,379
I hate it, man. It's
depressing. Otto's sucks!

105
00:06:26,486 --> 00:06:28,579
You don't know about no
motherfucking hard time, man.

106
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:31,885
I'm a ex-convict, man. Otto's
the only place that would hire me.

107
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:33,083
You too good
for Otto's now?

108
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:34,181
I'm not too
good for it.

109
00:06:34,293 --> 00:06:35,453
I just don't... It's not
for me, you know, I'm sorry.

110
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:36,550
See that bridge?
1,200 bucks.

111
00:06:38,596 --> 00:06:39,585
Okay.

112
00:06:39,697 --> 00:06:42,393
On the house, man! Otto,
man! Otto's my lotto.

113
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,025
Come on, man, look. I can't
work here anymore, all right?

114
00:06:45,136 --> 00:06:46,831
What, you gonna be on TV
or some shit like that?

115
00:06:46,938 --> 00:06:48,803
<i>I am gonna be on TV. The chunky
guy on Survivor or some shit?</i>

116
00:06:48,907 --> 00:06:50,340
No, I'm gonna
be like Seinfeld.

117
00:06:50,441 --> 00:06:52,170
Get the fuck
out of here, man!

118
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:53,577
You ain't gonna
be like Seinfeld.

119
00:06:53,678 --> 00:06:55,646
Seinfeld's my
motherfucking man!

120
00:06:55,747 --> 00:06:57,044
Now Kramer,

121
00:06:57,148 --> 00:06:59,844
Kramer gets a pass from me
'cause Kramer's my nigger.

122
00:06:59,951 --> 00:07:01,976
Well, very
forgiving of you.

123
00:07:02,086 --> 00:07:04,213
Look, as a friend, man,
let me tell you something.

124
00:07:04,322 --> 00:07:05,789
You're not funny.
I think I'm funny.

125
00:07:05,890 --> 00:07:08,017
I got new jokes, man,
and they're good.

126
00:07:08,126 --> 00:07:09,286
Let me hear one
of your new jokes.

127
00:07:09,394 --> 00:07:11,419
Okay, I got one like,

128
00:07:11,529 --> 00:07:13,997
<i>I'm really good at Guitar
Hero, you know, on PlayStation,</i>

129
00:07:14,098 --> 00:07:16,794
and I was so good at it, I thought,
like, "Maybe I should get a guitar. "

130
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:18,801
<i>Then I thought like, "I'm
really good at Grand Theft Auto,</i>

131
00:07:18,903 --> 00:07:20,768
"maybe I should start
beating up hookers. "

132
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:23,131
Okay, that got me.
That was humorous.

133
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:24,538
I thought
you'd like that.

134
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:26,007
But, yo, I ain't
got no dough, man.

135
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:27,441
For real, if I had
some dough, I would go.

136
00:07:27,545 --> 00:07:28,512
I'll pay your
cover charge.

137
00:07:28,613 --> 00:07:29,739
That's the night
I take my wife out also,

138
00:07:29,847 --> 00:07:30,836
so you gotta pay
for my bitch, too.

139
00:07:32,568 --> 00:07:34,661
Okay, I'll do it. Okay. If
you come and laugh. Laugh loud.

140
00:07:35,870 --> 00:07:36,894
Like that?
That's good. Perfect.

141
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:37,972
I'll see you
Saturday then.

142
00:07:38,073 --> 00:07:39,062
Okay, good.
Thank you.

143
00:07:39,174 --> 00:07:41,404
<i>Craig, listen to me. I'm
doing the best I can, okay?</i>

144
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:46,071
<i>I wiped your ass our entire
childhood. Now it's your turn, buddy!</i>

145
00:07:46,181 --> 00:07:48,376
<i>Well, you're the one that asked
the wizard to make you young again.</i>

146
00:07:48,483 --> 00:07:49,814
<i>I didn't mean
this young!</i>

147
00:07:51,486 --> 00:07:53,249
<i>Last time I had a suit on,
at my bar mitzvah.</i>

148
00:07:53,355 --> 00:07:55,050
<i>My bar mitzvah,
it was the last...</i>

149
00:07:55,156 --> 00:07:56,783
<i>And now I got the same suit.
It's the same suit.</i>

150
00:07:56,891 --> 00:08:00,224
<i>I think it looks good. The bar
mitzvah was a good day in my life.</i>

151
00:08:00,328 --> 00:08:02,694
<i>I made more money that day than
I think I'll ever make again.</i>

152
00:08:03,865 --> 00:08:06,993
<i>You know, it's really sad. To
peak at 13 is a weird feeling.</i>

153
00:08:07,102 --> 00:08:08,069
<i>This is indicative
of the kind of...</i>

154
00:08:08,169 --> 00:08:09,727
<i>Yo. Yo. Shoot that. Look at that!</i>

155
00:08:09,838 --> 00:08:13,069
<i>Both those girls just go,
"That's the guy from MTV."</i>

156
00:08:13,174 --> 00:08:15,734
<i>I swear on my life, those two
girls, they were just going,</i>

157
00:08:15,844 --> 00:08:18,278
<i>"That's the guy. " It's
the second time it happened.</i>

158
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:22,680
<i>I got off a... I got off,
I got off the bus, and...</i>

159
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:24,684
<i>I mean, the train.
I'm walking out...</i>

160
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:03,620
<i>Me and Ann traded shifts.
My family's in from Green Bay.</i>

161
00:09:03,725 --> 00:09:06,660
<i>You know, come to see how their
daughter's doing in the big city.</i>

162
00:09:06,761 --> 00:09:08,854
<i>You know, wait, you went
to school here, right?</i>

163
00:09:11,232 --> 00:09:12,199
<i>Hello?</i>

164
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:15,497
Hey, Laura, it's George.

165
00:09:15,603 --> 00:09:19,266
How's the northern side
of California going?

166
00:09:20,141 --> 00:09:21,836
<i>What do you
want, George?</i>

167
00:09:22,610 --> 00:09:24,578
I was wondering if
you had a few minutes.

168
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:27,671
I wanted to talk
to you about something.

169
00:09:28,149 --> 00:09:32,609
Actually, I don't. I was
just walking out the door.

170
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,814
Is it okay if I get your number
and I'll give you a call back later?

171
00:09:36,524 --> 00:09:38,492
<i>I know I'm not
supposed to call you.</i>

172
00:09:38,593 --> 00:09:41,061
I just wanted
to let you know that,

173
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:45,895
that I really am so
sorry about everything.

174
00:09:48,036 --> 00:09:50,027
I'm sorry, I screwed up.

175
00:09:52,073 --> 00:09:53,973
<i>Too bad you didn't
realize that back then, but</i>

176
00:09:54,075 --> 00:09:57,340
anyway, I gotta go. Do you
want me to call you back?

177
00:09:58,379 --> 00:10:01,246
<i>No, you don't have to call me
back. I know you're not going to,</i>

178
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:04,749
but I just wanted to let you
know I was sorry one more time.

179
00:10:04,853 --> 00:10:07,754
<i>Okay. Well, all right.
Okay, good luck, George.</i>

180
00:10:07,856 --> 00:10:08,914
Okay.

181
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:18,781
You know, so, like, I have this joke
about how, like, you never see, like,

182
00:10:18,884 --> 00:10:22,376
a very attractive, blonde,
big-breasted homeless woman.

183
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:25,979
You know, like, someone will take
care of that person no matter what.

184
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:27,956
That woman's gonna be fine.
All right, so here's the joke.

185
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,426
You can be attractive and
stupid and make it in the world.

186
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:31,496
Yeah.

187
00:10:31,596 --> 00:10:32,756
And you could be unattractive and smart

188
00:10:32,864 --> 00:10:34,024
and make it in the world. Yeah.

189
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:37,397
But it's the ugly, dumb
people who are really screwed

190
00:10:37,502 --> 00:10:39,163
'cause they're ignorant
and an eyesore.

191
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:40,238
That's funny, man.

192
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:41,738
That's pretty funny.
I think that'll work.

193
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,102
I was thinking of doing
this thing where, like,

194
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:44,732
I'm not good-looking
and I'm not bad-looking.

195
00:10:44,843 --> 00:10:46,242
I'm kind of, like, right
in the middle, you know.

196
00:10:46,345 --> 00:10:49,940
Like... Like, if I had a good personality,
I could get any chick in the world,

197
00:10:50,048 --> 00:10:51,948
but I don't.
Yeah, it doesn't work.

198
00:10:52,050 --> 00:10:53,881
I auditioned for Budd
Friedman at the Improv.

199
00:10:53,985 --> 00:10:54,974
He okayed me
and made me a regular.

200
00:10:56,738 --> 00:10:57,796
Budd won't even
look me in the eye.

201
00:10:57,905 --> 00:11:00,897
Man, that's... Good for
you, man. Congratulations.

202
00:11:01,008 --> 00:11:02,873
You shouldn't have lost
all that weight, man.

203
00:11:02,977 --> 00:11:04,535
There's nothing funny
about a physically-fit man.

204
00:11:04,645 --> 00:11:06,442
I know. It's lame, right? Yeah.

205
00:11:06,547 --> 00:11:08,447
No one wants to watch
Lance Armstrong do comedy.

206
00:11:08,549 --> 00:11:09,777
Oh, God.

207
00:11:09,884 --> 00:11:11,044
Hey, Ira.

208
00:11:11,151 --> 00:11:14,314
Oh, hey, Mark. Can you do me a
favor and never leave a paycheck

209
00:11:14,421 --> 00:11:16,889
from your shit sitcom on my
pillow ever again, please?

210
00:11:16,991 --> 00:11:20,119
That is so rude of me to
accidentally leave my paycheck

211
00:11:20,227 --> 00:11:23,924
for $25,000 on your pillow. I'm sorry.

212
00:11:24,031 --> 00:11:24,998
It's a dick move.

213
00:11:25,099 --> 00:11:26,464
It's just,
they keep coming,

214
00:11:26,567 --> 00:11:27,761
you know,
week after week.

215
00:11:27,868 --> 00:11:29,893
It's getting a little bit hard
to keep track of them all.

216
00:11:30,004 --> 00:11:31,528
You know what?
Becoming marginally famous

217
00:11:31,639 --> 00:11:33,231
has really turned
you into an asshole.

218
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:37,470
Now listen, I'd love to stay here and
chat with you, but we have company.

219
00:11:37,578 --> 00:11:39,739
You know that girl comedian
who lives across the street?

220
00:11:39,847 --> 00:11:41,474
The one with the dark hair
and the bangs?

221
00:11:41,582 --> 00:11:42,640
Daisy, yeah.
Daisy, right.

222
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:45,947
Well, I bumped into her
outside and I invited her in,

223
00:11:46,053 --> 00:11:48,613
and she's sitting in our
living room right now.

224
00:11:48,722 --> 00:11:50,019
She's out there
right now?

225
00:11:50,124 --> 00:11:52,957
She's hot and she's mousy,
but kind of like...

226
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:55,392
She's mousy like a mouse you
want to stick your dick in.

227
00:11:55,496 --> 00:11:57,396
Yeah, you've gotta get
out there and talk to her.

228
00:11:57,498 --> 00:11:58,465
Why would you do that?

229
00:11:58,566 --> 00:11:59,897
What do you mean,
why would I do that?

230
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,967
I'm trying to hook you up.

231
00:12:01,068 --> 00:12:02,228
Well, I'm laying
groundwork, man.

232
00:12:02,336 --> 00:12:04,270
I got a three-month plan. You
can't just throw me into this.

233
00:12:04,371 --> 00:12:06,498
I'll give you 10 days
on your three-month plan.

234
00:12:06,607 --> 00:12:08,165
No, I need 80
more days than that!

235
00:12:08,275 --> 00:12:12,302
Okay, I do this because I care
about you. I do this to motivate you.

236
00:12:12,413 --> 00:12:16,281
But I will fuck that girl
in 10 days. I promise.

237
00:12:16,383 --> 00:12:18,044
Come on, dude,
I'm not cute like you.

238
00:12:18,152 --> 00:12:21,451
I don't look like Jackson
Browne. I look like Jon Favreau!

239
00:12:21,555 --> 00:12:24,023
Don't do this to me.
Don't make me fuck her.

240
00:12:24,124 --> 00:12:25,386
Well, then just
don't fuck her!

241
00:12:25,492 --> 00:12:27,824
Don't you put me in this corner
where I have to fuck my way out.

242
00:12:27,928 --> 00:12:30,829
He'll do it, too. He'll do it.
I've seen him do this before.

243
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:33,923
I'm gonna go out there and warm
her up. I'll see you out there.

244
00:12:34,268 --> 00:12:35,633
<i>Kanye.
Kanye!</i>

245
00:12:35,736 --> 00:12:36,794
<i>No. T.I.
T.I.</i>

246
00:12:36,904 --> 00:12:38,337
<i>Lil Weezy.
It's all about Common.</i>

247
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:39,963
<i>Eminem. But do you guys know</i>

248
00:12:40,074 --> 00:12:42,304
<i>who the greatest
rapper of all time is?</i>

249
00:12:42,810 --> 00:12:46,371
<i>William Shakespeare!</i>

250
00:12:47,648 --> 00:12:50,947
I know it's silly, but it's
fun. You know, people like it.

251
00:12:51,051 --> 00:12:52,211
Yeah.
You know?

252
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:54,787
It's just cool that
you're on TV. I mean...

253
00:12:54,888 --> 00:12:56,788
I can't believe you
haven't seen this before.

254
00:12:57,324 --> 00:13:00,293
Yeah, I can't believe
it's gotten by me.

255
00:13:00,394 --> 00:13:04,228
Is it on a kids channel? WB?
A teen channel or something?

256
00:13:04,331 --> 00:13:05,298
No. It's on NBC.

257
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:06,366
Really?

258
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:08,264
Ira, this is Daisy.
Oh!

259
00:13:08,369 --> 00:13:09,597
Daisy, Ira.
Hi.

260
00:13:09,703 --> 00:13:10,727
How are you? How's it going? Good.

261
00:13:10,838 --> 00:13:11,862
Actually, I have a cold,
so I shouldn't...

262
00:13:11,972 --> 00:13:12,961
Oh!

263
00:13:13,474 --> 00:13:14,441
Air shake.

264
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,644
I've actually seen you do comedy
at the Improv a couple times.

265
00:13:18,746 --> 00:13:20,646
Yeah, you're really...
You're really, really funny.

266
00:13:20,748 --> 00:13:22,409
Oh, thanks.

267
00:13:23,217 --> 00:13:24,946
You know, Ira
just lost 20 pounds.

268
00:13:25,052 --> 00:13:26,781
Oh, congratulations.

269
00:13:26,887 --> 00:13:28,855
Yes, I did.
All from my cock.

270
00:13:28,956 --> 00:13:31,186
Um... So...

271
00:13:32,126 --> 00:13:36,062
So, this episode right here
is actually a two-parter.

272
00:13:36,163 --> 00:13:39,223
Great, so does that mean we're
gonna watch both parts right now?

273
00:13:39,333 --> 00:13:41,096
Oh, shoot. Oh, God.

274
00:13:41,201 --> 00:13:42,498
You need some help
with that, Ira?

275
00:13:42,603 --> 00:13:43,865
No! No, it's...

276
00:13:43,971 --> 00:13:46,098
It's okay, I got it.
I got it. I got it.

277
00:13:46,573 --> 00:13:47,631
Mmm.

278
00:13:50,844 --> 00:13:53,540
I'm joking.
I'll get a rag.

279
00:13:53,914 --> 00:13:55,779
See you in nine days, Ira!

280
00:13:56,984 --> 00:13:57,630
<i>I went
to a place recently</i>

281
00:13:57,665 --> 00:13:58,277
<i>I went
to a place recently</i>

282
00:13:58,385 --> 00:14:01,286
<i>I'm convinced is the most
fucked up, crazy place</i>

283
00:14:01,388 --> 00:14:06,849
<i>I've ever been to. It's a little
place called Cold Stone Creamery.</i>

284
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,427
<i>Now, the thing
at Cold Stone is...</i>

285
00:14:08,529 --> 00:14:11,054
I can't believe this
is what people like.

286
00:14:11,165 --> 00:14:17,695
<i>The sizes are "like it,"
"love it" and "gotta have it!"</i>

287
00:14:18,072 --> 00:14:20,939
<i>What kind of crackhead
terminology is that?</i>

288
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,099
<i>"What size you want, man?"</i>

289
00:14:22,209 --> 00:14:24,177
<i>"I don't know, man,
I just gotta have it!</i>

290
00:14:24,278 --> 00:14:26,610
<i>"Put some ice cream in a cup
with some sprinkles!</i>

291
00:14:26,714 --> 00:14:29,444
<i>"Put your dick in a Butterfinger
and fuck it for me, please!</i>

292
00:14:29,550 --> 00:14:32,951
<i>"Put it in the cup! I need it! I'm
tweaking! I'm tweaking! I'm tweaking!</i>

293
00:14:33,053 --> 00:14:35,647
<i>"I'm tweaking! I'm tweaking!
I'm tweaking! I'm tweaking!</i>

294
00:14:35,756 --> 00:14:37,747
<i>"I'm tweaking! I'm
tweaking! I'm tweaking!"</i>

295
00:14:37,858 --> 00:14:40,850
<i>That's how it's done, son!
That's how it's done, son!</i>

296
00:14:41,762 --> 00:14:43,525
Killed it, man.
Crowd was crazy.

297
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:45,530
Is it always that wild
on a Wednesday?

298
00:14:45,632 --> 00:14:47,259
No, they were... They
seem pretty good out there.

299
00:14:47,367 --> 00:14:48,334
I'm really stepping up my game.

300
00:14:48,435 --> 00:14:51,063
These bitches gotta
start paying me for this.

301
00:14:51,171 --> 00:14:54,572
Can't get no more free Randy. I
just fucked that crowd in the ass.

302
00:14:54,675 --> 00:14:55,642
Yeah.

303
00:14:55,743 --> 00:14:57,711
Just awesome.
Just fucking bam!

304
00:14:57,811 --> 00:15:02,009
Crowd, me, bam! Crowd, me...
My stand-up's my dick.

305
00:15:03,951 --> 00:15:05,976
You know? I'm gonna do the same thing.

306
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:09,718
Bullshit! Let's get some
M&M's and chips going.

307
00:15:09,823 --> 00:15:10,812
Yellow!
- Ira!

308
00:15:12,443 --> 00:15:14,536
Hey. Kevin Rooney
didn't show up,

309
00:15:14,645 --> 00:15:16,044
so you're gonna do
10 minutes after Leo.

310
00:15:16,747 --> 00:15:18,374
Really? Okay.
Thanks. Yeah.

311
00:15:18,482 --> 00:15:20,382
"Yeah,
thanks, yeah. "

312
00:15:27,658 --> 00:15:30,286
Hey. Did he just tell
you you're going on next?

313
00:15:30,394 --> 00:15:32,294
Yeah, I'm on next. Okay.
Well, I'm on after you,

314
00:15:32,396 --> 00:15:34,694
and if you go long, this is
going to die in my pocket.

315
00:15:35,899 --> 00:15:38,367
That wasn't a joke.
I'm not a comic.

316
00:15:38,636 --> 00:15:40,968
Okay, when you get the light
that means one minute.

317
00:15:41,071 --> 00:15:42,038
Okay.

318
00:15:42,339 --> 00:15:44,398
<i>The other night, I heard my
balls and my dick talking.</i>

319
00:15:44,508 --> 00:15:45,497
<i>And my balls were like,</i>

320
00:15:47,295 --> 00:15:48,455
<i>"Are you okay?</i>

321
00:15:51,531 --> 00:15:53,021
<i>"Is he hurting you?"</i>

322
00:15:53,800 --> 00:15:55,825
<i>And my dick's like, "You
don't know him like I do.</i>

323
00:15:55,936 --> 00:15:58,097
<i>"He's a great guy.
He loves me. "</i>

324
00:15:59,573 --> 00:16:01,097
<i>There's always one guy that
laughs way too hard in the...</i>

325
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:02,835
Hey. George Simmons
just showed up.

326
00:16:02,943 --> 00:16:05,070
He wants to go on,
so you are bumped.

327
00:16:05,212 --> 00:16:06,679
Okay, how long
does he do?

328
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:07,769
How the fuck
should I know?

329
00:16:07,881 --> 00:16:09,473
He hasn't been here in five
years, but you gotta be ready.

330
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,572
Okay.
Okay.

331
00:16:10,684 --> 00:16:12,982
<i>Thank you, guys!
It's really nice to be here!</i>

332
00:16:14,654 --> 00:16:16,349
See that? I fucking killed
out there. Yeah, that was good.

333
00:16:16,456 --> 00:16:17,718
Watch out, Leo, watch out.
All my new shit worked.

334
00:16:17,824 --> 00:16:18,813
Yeah.
Yeah.

335
00:16:18,925 --> 00:16:20,620
I was supposed to go on after
you. George Simmons showed up.

336
00:16:20,727 --> 00:16:22,058
Now I'm gonna
go on after him.

337
00:16:22,162 --> 00:16:23,686
George Simmons is going
up right now? Yeah.

338
00:16:23,797 --> 00:16:25,094
I just opened
for George Simmons?

339
00:16:25,198 --> 00:16:26,426
Yeah.

340
00:16:26,533 --> 00:16:28,000
That's fucking
awesome, man!

341
00:16:29,636 --> 00:16:31,433
<i>Yeah!</i>

342
00:16:32,072 --> 00:16:34,267
<i>All right!</i>

343
00:16:36,176 --> 00:16:38,144
<i>Yeah, all right,
I'm scared.</i>

344
00:16:38,245 --> 00:16:40,509
<i>I'm scared
for all of you guys.</i>

345
00:16:40,614 --> 00:16:44,550
<i>You need me! You need me.
I'm not gonna be here forever.</i>

346
00:16:45,385 --> 00:16:49,446
<i>Who's gonna amuse you?
It's so simple.</i>

347
00:16:49,556 --> 00:16:50,716
<i>You just look at each other and say...</i>

348
00:16:52,826 --> 00:16:53,815
<i>Everyone's laughing.</i>

349
00:16:55,679 --> 00:17:00,412
<i>You people are so unamusing
you have to pay another person</i>

350
00:17:00,517 --> 00:17:03,850
<i>to come and amuse you.
What do you do at home?</i>

351
00:17:03,954 --> 00:17:05,854
<i>Just sit, fucking antsy,
all day long,</i>

352
00:17:05,956 --> 00:17:08,447
<i>"When are we gonna get
to that amusement place?</i>

353
00:17:08,558 --> 00:17:11,857
<i>"Amuse me. " You should be
thanking me for those movies.</i>

354
00:17:12,128 --> 00:17:14,221
<i>"Oh! Finally, a movie.
Let's watch it together. "</i>

355
00:17:14,331 --> 00:17:15,889
<i>That's the beauty
of movies, by the way.</i>

356
00:17:15,999 --> 00:17:17,762
<i>You go in there and you don't
have to talk to each other.</i>

357
00:17:17,867 --> 00:17:19,698
<i>And it's fun. You could
stare at the screen.</i>

358
00:17:20,103 --> 00:17:23,664
<i>And, "Maybe we don't hate each
other 'cause we both like this movie.</i>

359
00:17:24,874 --> 00:17:27,468
<i>"We are connecting on that.</i>

360
00:17:28,011 --> 00:17:30,707
<i>"Hey, we're still together.</i>

361
00:17:30,814 --> 00:17:33,783
<i>"All these years later, we
still love each other, right?</i>

362
00:17:33,883 --> 00:17:37,444
<i>"During the movie, yes. When the
movie's over, 'You fucking bitch.</i>

363
00:17:38,788 --> 00:17:43,088
<i>"'Why am I still with you?
We have nothing in common.</i>

364
00:17:43,193 --> 00:17:45,058
<i>"'Something's missing. "'</i>

365
00:17:45,195 --> 00:17:47,425
<i>Anyways, I have no religion.</i>

366
00:17:47,530 --> 00:17:49,521
<i>My parents did not
believe in God.</i>

367
00:17:49,633 --> 00:17:51,260
<i>That was great.
They passed that along.</i>

368
00:17:51,368 --> 00:17:52,460
<i>I didn't even have
a fucking choice.</i>

369
00:17:52,569 --> 00:17:55,197
<i>They were like,
"Nope, don't do it. "</i>

370
00:17:55,305 --> 00:17:57,739
<i>"Really? So, when Grandpa
dies he goes to heaven?"</i>

371
00:17:57,841 --> 00:18:00,275
<i>"Nope, he'll be
in the ground. "</i>

372
00:18:00,377 --> 00:18:02,572
<i>"Thanks, Dad. Should
I sleep now? 'Cause I...</i>

373
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:04,408
<i>"There's no way I'll have
a nightmare tonight. "</i>

374
00:18:04,514 --> 00:18:07,347
<i>"Fuck you. I don't believe
in nightmares, either.</i>

375
00:18:07,984 --> 00:18:09,383
<i>"Fags have nightmares.</i>

376
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,945
<i>"If there was a God, why would
there be a Holocaust? Go to bed, Son.</i>

377
00:18:14,674 --> 00:18:15,402
<i>"Pleasant dreams. "</i>

378
00:18:15,507 --> 00:18:16,474
Simmons is getting
a little dark.

379
00:18:16,575 --> 00:18:17,735
What is he doing?

380
00:18:19,711 --> 00:18:22,271
<i>When you hear
the waitress's footsteps</i>

381
00:18:23,215 --> 00:18:27,481
<i>that's when you know
you're not doing well.</i>

382
00:18:31,423 --> 00:18:33,323
<i>Oh, boy,
it's quiet in here.</i>

383
00:18:36,995 --> 00:18:38,087
<i>You hear that?</i>

384
00:18:40,899 --> 00:18:43,026
<i>I think I can
hear the freeway.</i>

385
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:46,337
<i>Hello! I'm Ira Wright.</i>

386
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:50,940
<i>I'm not good-looking
and I'm not bad-looking.</i>

387
00:18:51,043 --> 00:18:52,476
<i>I'm kind of right
in the middle.</i>

388
00:18:52,578 --> 00:18:54,978
<i>So, like, if I had
a good personality,</i>

389
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,014
<i>that might make it so
girls really liked me,</i>

390
00:18:57,115 --> 00:18:59,083
<i>but I don't. So...</i>

391
00:18:59,418 --> 00:19:01,113
<i>Um... Uh...</i>

392
00:19:02,454 --> 00:19:05,116
<i>Okay. George Simmons. Wow.</i>

393
00:19:05,824 --> 00:19:07,257
<i>Now what do we do?</i>

394
00:19:07,826 --> 00:19:10,727
<i>He seems unhappy with his
money. Give it to me, I'll...</i>

395
00:19:10,829 --> 00:19:13,389
<i>I could really spend that.</i>

396
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:17,558
<i>If he's depressed with his life,
I don't know what I'm gonna do.</i>

397
00:19:17,669 --> 00:19:19,864
<i>I live on my friend's
pull-out couch.</i>

398
00:19:20,939 --> 00:19:22,998
<i>So, anyway, I...
Wait, did you hear that?</i>

399
00:19:23,108 --> 00:19:26,441
<i>Yeah, George Simmons just shot
himself in the face backstage.</i>

400
00:19:26,545 --> 00:19:28,843
<i>It's sad knowing
MerMan's crying inside.</i>

401
00:19:29,114 --> 00:19:30,274
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

402
00:19:30,682 --> 00:19:32,912
<i>Is he organizing a mass suicide?
Is that where you're going?</i>

403
00:19:33,018 --> 00:19:34,576
<i>Are you joining him?</i>

404
00:19:34,686 --> 00:19:37,246
<i>Save some Kool-Aid for me.
Just do it.</i>

405
00:19:37,689 --> 00:19:41,523
<i>Don't worry, the next guy who's coming
out has a dove hidden up his asshole, so...</i>

406
00:19:41,627 --> 00:19:43,720
<i>And then Robin Williams is
gonna slit his wrists out here.</i>

407
00:19:43,829 --> 00:19:45,160
<i>So, that's nice, also.</i>

408
00:19:45,764 --> 00:19:49,063
<i>I am Ira Wright, everybody. Thank
you, very much. Have a good night.</i>

409
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:55,505
Give me a break.

410
00:20:01,547 --> 00:20:03,708
Yo! Hey! Hey!

411
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,919
This fucking guy.

412
00:20:11,890 --> 00:20:13,118
What's up?

413
00:20:13,225 --> 00:20:16,251
Hey. I'm sorry.

414
00:20:17,095 --> 00:20:20,223
I'm parked right on the other
side of you and I can't get in.

415
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:22,800
What, you come here to make
some jokes to my face now?

416
00:20:22,901 --> 00:20:24,300
You're hard to follow.
I didn't know what to say.

417
00:20:24,403 --> 00:20:25,734
I'm sorry about that.
No, don't be.

418
00:20:26,038 --> 00:20:28,598
I would've done the same.
You had to comment on it.

419
00:20:30,008 --> 00:20:32,101
Yeah, you had
some funny shit.

420
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,234
You're a good writer.

421
00:20:33,345 --> 00:20:34,312
Thank you.

422
00:20:35,547 --> 00:20:39,415
Your friend... Is that your
friend? The fatter version of you?

423
00:20:39,518 --> 00:20:41,748
He's my roommate.
Yeah, he's really funny.

424
00:20:41,853 --> 00:20:44,321
You got good stuff.
You're gonna be all right.

425
00:20:44,823 --> 00:20:46,791
Wow, that is so nice
of you to say, man.

426
00:20:46,892 --> 00:20:48,382
That's so...
I appreciate it. Hey!

427
00:20:48,493 --> 00:20:50,791
You know, well, I've been a
really big fan of yours. All of us.

428
00:20:50,896 --> 00:20:53,330
We kind of grew up on your shit
and, you know, incidentally.

429
00:20:53,432 --> 00:20:55,900
So, that's so nice of you
to say, man. Thanks.

430
00:20:57,502 --> 00:20:58,662
Thank you!

431
00:20:59,905 --> 00:21:01,031
Nice to meet you, man!

432
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,299
You're gonna die!

433
00:21:06,345 --> 00:21:08,870
And I'm gonna
kill you!

434
00:21:12,684 --> 00:21:14,481
Man, that was awesome.

435
00:21:25,464 --> 00:21:26,431
Cats.

436
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:29,460
Can you dig it?
Mmm-hmm.

437
00:21:29,568 --> 00:21:30,830
Just a bunch of cats.

438
00:21:31,503 --> 00:21:32,936
Then me doing stuff.

439
00:21:33,538 --> 00:21:35,563
Then back to the
cats doing stuff.

440
00:21:36,508 --> 00:21:39,636
You've gotten 700,000 hits
in four days from this?

441
00:21:39,745 --> 00:21:43,613
Yep. If you put "cute kitten" in
the title of your YouTube video,

442
00:21:43,715 --> 00:21:45,182
you're gonna get a
million hits. Mmm-hmm.

443
00:21:45,283 --> 00:21:46,807
And then I link
that to my website

444
00:21:46,918 --> 00:21:49,443
and you can see my stand-up
on my website. It's genius.

445
00:21:49,554 --> 00:21:52,523
Why don't you just call it
like, "Megan Fox Blows Someone"?

446
00:21:52,624 --> 00:21:54,990
And then more people
would google that.

447
00:21:55,093 --> 00:21:58,153
Hi. I've got two girls coming
over here in a little bit.

448
00:21:58,263 --> 00:22:00,697
Can you fold up your bed,
please, into the couch?

449
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:02,767
I don't want the place to look
like a mess when they get here.

450
00:22:02,868 --> 00:22:03,835
Okay, I'm sorry.
I was watching this thing.

451
00:22:05,003 --> 00:22:06,265
All right? Okay.

452
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,100
Hello?

453
00:22:10,542 --> 00:22:12,169
<i>Hey, this is George Simmons.</i>

454
00:22:13,712 --> 00:22:15,771
Fuck you, Craig.
What's happening, man?

455
00:22:15,881 --> 00:22:18,873
<i>It's not your dumb-ass friend
Craig. It's George Simmons.</i>

456
00:22:20,252 --> 00:22:21,241
Oh!

457
00:22:21,353 --> 00:22:24,151
I'm sorry. Hey.
Hey, how's it going, man?

458
00:22:24,256 --> 00:22:27,225
Hey, hey, good job last night.
You guys were pretty funny.

459
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:30,294
You and the triple-XL
version of you.

460
00:22:30,862 --> 00:22:34,662
Oh. Yeah. Thank... Thank you.
That's... I... Well, I appreciate that.

461
00:22:34,766 --> 00:22:36,825
<i>You guys are all right.
Good job. I...</i>

462
00:22:37,202 --> 00:22:40,694
I'm doing this corporate gig for MySpace

463
00:22:41,273 --> 00:22:44,367
and I'm gonna need
some jokes and shit.

464
00:22:44,476 --> 00:22:47,070
I was thinking maybe you guys
would want to write me some.

465
00:22:49,114 --> 00:22:52,709
You know, he's kind of
a flaky guy, but I'm...

466
00:22:52,818 --> 00:22:54,183
I've got nothing
going on, man.

467
00:22:54,286 --> 00:22:57,653
I would... I'd love to do
that. Sure. Totally. I'm in.

468
00:22:58,123 --> 00:22:59,317
<i>What kind of jokes
do you need?</i>

469
00:22:59,725 --> 00:23:02,819
Just shit about them or
computers or whatever they like.

470
00:23:02,928 --> 00:23:05,988
<i>When you sprinkle a little lemon
there, they get excited, you know.</i>

471
00:23:06,131 --> 00:23:07,996
<i>That's no problem.
That makes sense.</i>

472
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,364
So, you want to be held accountable,
come watch me do them tomorrow?

473
00:23:10,469 --> 00:23:11,902
<i>I'll take you to the gig.
Okay, cool, yeah.</i>

474
00:23:12,003 --> 00:23:14,639
How should I... How should I...
How should I get them to you?

475
00:23:15,574 --> 00:23:18,304
I can give you my fax
number and my e-mail.

476
00:23:18,410 --> 00:23:19,502
What's your e-mail?

477
00:23:19,611 --> 00:23:21,806
My e-mail?

478
00:23:21,913 --> 00:23:28,148
It's irasexira@yahoo. com.

479
00:23:30,455 --> 00:23:32,923
Wow. I'm just... I'm starting
to reconsider asking you.

480
00:23:33,024 --> 00:23:35,390
<i>Don't do that. It's from high
school. It was funny then.</i>

481
00:23:35,494 --> 00:23:36,791
Yeah, you should
change it.

482
00:23:36,895 --> 00:23:38,624
<i>It's, like, 13 years old. Okay, I will.</i>

483
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:39,992
I mean change it now.

484
00:23:40,098 --> 00:23:42,225
Okay, I'll change it,
I'll change it ASAP.

485
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:44,996
<i>Okay, don't say
"ASAP," either.</i>

486
00:23:45,103 --> 00:23:48,937
<i>And don't say "I'm chilling" or
"It's all good" or any of that stuff.</i>

487
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:52,066
<i>Okay, I don't. I don't
chill anyway, so I won't.</i>

488
00:23:52,177 --> 00:23:54,372
<i>And it's not all good,
so don't worry.</i>

489
00:23:54,479 --> 00:23:55,969
<i>Okay, Ira.
Okay.</i>

490
00:23:56,114 --> 00:23:57,843
All right, Ira.

491
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:04,785
Guys, that was George
Simmons on the phone.

492
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:06,289
He saw me
do stand-up.

493
00:24:06,391 --> 00:24:08,757
He thinks I'm funny! He wants
me to write jokes for him!

494
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:10,327
What?
Yep!

495
00:24:10,862 --> 00:24:11,829
Why?

496
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,420
Why? He thinks I'm funny!

497
00:24:13,532 --> 00:24:15,022
This doesn't make
any sense at all.

498
00:24:15,133 --> 00:24:16,100
No?

499
00:24:16,635 --> 00:24:18,296
Jeez, I gotta
get started.

500
00:24:19,604 --> 00:24:20,571
What is happening?

501
00:24:20,672 --> 00:24:21,866
You forgot about the bed!

502
00:24:24,476 --> 00:24:27,001
Friends. Friends on MySpace. Nerds.

503
00:24:27,112 --> 00:24:29,580
Nerds... Nerds have
no friends in real life.

504
00:24:29,681 --> 00:24:33,139
The more friends on MySpace, the
less friends you have in real life.

505
00:24:33,251 --> 00:24:35,185
"How does the softball
team at MySpace work?

506
00:24:35,287 --> 00:24:38,120
"Does everyone get picked
last?" That could be funny.

507
00:24:38,223 --> 00:24:40,657
At some point, you should have
George say, "Fuck Facebook!"

508
00:24:40,759 --> 00:24:42,386
"Fuck Facebook in the face!"

509
00:24:43,829 --> 00:24:47,663
So, like, that's funny. All right,
tell George I wrote that, okay?

510
00:24:47,766 --> 00:24:48,755
Totally. Totally, man.
You gotta be like,

511
00:24:48,867 --> 00:24:50,459
"Leo wrote that. "
Yeah, no, no, no, totally.

512
00:25:04,449 --> 00:25:06,110
Hey, Ira,
I think this is him!

513
00:25:10,255 --> 00:25:11,654
He's got a limo!

514
00:25:11,756 --> 00:25:12,745
Can we go out
and meet him?

515
00:25:12,858 --> 00:25:13,984
No, no, no. You can't say hi to him.

516
00:25:14,092 --> 00:25:16,026
Just let me get in
with him a little more

517
00:25:16,127 --> 00:25:17,389
before I introduce
people to him.

518
00:25:17,495 --> 00:25:18,894
Don't kiss his ass
too hard, all right?

519
00:25:18,997 --> 00:25:21,090
Stars hate it when you
kiss their ass too hard.

520
00:25:21,199 --> 00:25:23,030
I hate it when people kiss
my ass too hard. You do?

521
00:25:23,134 --> 00:25:24,431
You hate it when people
kiss your ass too hard?

522
00:25:24,536 --> 00:25:25,833
I hate it.

523
00:25:34,045 --> 00:25:35,012
Man!

524
00:25:35,113 --> 00:25:37,911
Hey. I feel like
we're going to prom.

525
00:25:38,016 --> 00:25:41,543
Okay, well, we're not.
Okay, let's hit it!

526
00:25:43,355 --> 00:25:45,084
This is good.
I like this one

527
00:25:45,190 --> 00:25:48,921
about the guy from MySpace and the guy
from Craigslist getting into a fight.

528
00:25:49,027 --> 00:25:50,187
That's funny.

529
00:25:50,295 --> 00:25:51,694
You're excited.

530
00:25:51,796 --> 00:25:52,763
I am excited.

531
00:25:52,864 --> 00:25:53,990
Yeah, that's good.
It's good to be excited.

532
00:25:54,099 --> 00:25:55,327
I used to be excited.

533
00:25:55,433 --> 00:25:57,594
Well, it's awesome.
It's exciting.

534
00:26:05,176 --> 00:26:06,575
Wow!

535
00:26:14,719 --> 00:26:15,981
Thank you!

536
00:26:26,698 --> 00:26:27,824
Yeah!

537
00:26:29,434 --> 00:26:31,834
Brought the nice legs
with you. Good job.

538
00:26:31,937 --> 00:26:33,564
Hello, hello.
Good to see you, sir.

539
00:26:33,672 --> 00:26:34,934
Welcome aboard.
Thank you.

540
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,029
The name's Dave.
Hi, Dave.

541
00:26:36,141 --> 00:26:37,165
We may hit a few
bumps up there,

542
00:26:37,275 --> 00:26:38,469
nothing too crazy.
We'll get you there.

543
00:26:38,576 --> 00:26:39,565
Okay, cool!
All right.

544
00:26:39,678 --> 00:26:41,612
Hope you enjoy Chinese food. I love it!

545
00:26:41,713 --> 00:26:43,613
Very good. Enjoy your flight. Thank you.

546
00:26:44,482 --> 00:26:45,449
Wow!

547
00:26:50,588 --> 00:26:52,715
You guys were a little late, so we
had to put up James Taylor first.

548
00:26:52,824 --> 00:26:55,759
<i>Karen, she's a silver sun</i>

549
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:59,421
<i>You'd best walk her way
and watch it shine</i>

550
00:27:00,665 --> 00:27:03,964
<i>Watch her watch
the morning come</i>

551
00:27:06,571 --> 00:27:13,204
<i>A silver tear appearing now
that I'm cryin', ain't I</i>

552
00:27:13,678 --> 00:27:18,115
<i>I'm going to Carolina
in my mind</i>

553
00:27:18,216 --> 00:27:19,410
How'd you guys get him?

554
00:27:19,517 --> 00:27:20,643
Everybody's got
their price.

555
00:27:20,752 --> 00:27:23,277
<i>Last year, we had Roger Waters
doing Dark Side of the Moon.</i>

556
00:27:24,356 --> 00:27:26,950
<i>That love's
the finest thing around...</i>

557
00:27:27,092 --> 00:27:30,061
Okay, I thought it could
be funny if you just go,

558
00:27:30,161 --> 00:27:32,095
"Fuck Facebook in the face!"

559
00:27:32,197 --> 00:27:34,825
All right. Hey, you do five
minutes before I go up there.

560
00:27:35,533 --> 00:27:38,900
<i>What? No. No, I can't follow Fire
and Rain. Are you kidding me, man?</i>

561
00:27:39,004 --> 00:27:41,199
I can't follow it, either.
That's why you're going up there.

562
00:27:41,773 --> 00:27:48,645
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

563
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,179
<i>Thank you, MySpace!</i>

564
00:27:57,322 --> 00:27:58,755
<i>Fuck Facebook!</i>

565
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:03,291
I can't believe that.
He did the Facebook joke!

566
00:28:03,395 --> 00:28:05,056
Yeah!
He did the Facebook...

567
00:28:05,163 --> 00:28:07,188
I can't follow this, man.
I can't go on right now.

568
00:28:07,298 --> 00:28:10,995
Give me this shit.
Get up there. Be a man.

569
00:28:13,104 --> 00:28:14,799
<i>This is a pretty big room.</i>

570
00:28:17,342 --> 00:28:18,331
<i>Lot of people here.</i>

571
00:28:19,961 --> 00:28:23,055
<i>Let's have another round of
applause for James Taylor, everybody.</i>

572
00:28:30,171 --> 00:28:32,662
Yeah, do you
actually use MySpace?

573
00:28:33,842 --> 00:28:36,743
No, no, no. I fuck girls, Tom.
I don't have time for that.

574
00:28:37,512 --> 00:28:40,777
<i>I wonder if Tom and Craig from Craigslist
would ever get in a fight with each other.</i>

575
00:28:41,983 --> 00:28:44,611
<i>Who would win that fight?
That's what I want to know.</i>

576
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:51,183
<i>Tom or Craig,
who's tougher?</i>

577
00:28:51,893 --> 00:28:55,056
<i>Tom has more friends,
so that's probably good.</i>

578
00:28:55,163 --> 00:28:57,028
<i>Craig has weirder
friends, though.</i>

579
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:02,534
<i>Craig has friends that are willing to
do a lot more for cash. I will say that.</i>

580
00:29:08,910 --> 00:29:09,899
Eh?

581
00:29:10,011 --> 00:29:10,978
What the fuck
was that all about?

582
00:29:11,079 --> 00:29:12,603
You did all the jokes
you wrote for me.

583
00:29:12,714 --> 00:29:15,012
Oh, man, I know. I'm sorry. I
panicked. It's all they wanted.

584
00:29:15,116 --> 00:29:16,515
They just wanted MySpace
jokes. They didn't want...

585
00:29:16,618 --> 00:29:17,846
That's why I hired you
to write me MySpace jokes.

586
00:29:17,952 --> 00:29:19,214
I know, I'm sorry. That
one, I didn't tell that one.

587
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,309
That one will work.

588
00:29:20,421 --> 00:29:21,388
I guarantee you.

589
00:29:21,489 --> 00:29:23,457
It better work. They're
paying me 300 grand.

590
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:25,321
<i>Mr. George Simmons!
Really?</i>

591
00:29:29,631 --> 00:29:33,692
<i>Thank you. Thank you.
All right, Tom, thank you.</i>

592
00:29:33,802 --> 00:29:37,397
<i>Good evening, nerds! Yes!</i>

593
00:29:37,505 --> 00:29:40,872
<i>What about Ira, everybody? How'd
you feel about Ira Wright? Yeah.</i>

594
00:29:40,975 --> 00:29:42,670
<i>That guy, man.</i>

595
00:29:42,777 --> 00:29:46,372
<i>He is such a fucking nerd, I can't
believe he doesn't work with you people.</i>

596
00:29:47,849 --> 00:29:51,080
<i>Tom started MySpace just
to get friends, I know it.</i>

597
00:29:51,853 --> 00:29:53,844
<i>So, they say the more friends
you have on MySpace,</i>

598
00:29:53,955 --> 00:29:57,857
<i>the less friends you have
in real life. You know?</i>

599
00:29:57,959 --> 00:30:00,621
<i>"I have 100,000
friends on MySpace!</i>

600
00:30:01,196 --> 00:30:02,663
<i>"Yes!</i>

601
00:30:03,865 --> 00:30:07,733
<i>"Isn't that great? I have so
many friends on the computer. "</i>

602
00:30:08,536 --> 00:30:09,503
<i>"What are you doing tonight?"</i>

603
00:30:09,604 --> 00:30:11,401
<i>"I'll be on the computer.</i>

604
00:30:12,273 --> 00:30:13,900
<i>"That's what I do. "</i>

605
00:30:17,645 --> 00:30:20,580
<i>I hate the new generation
of coolness out there.</i>

606
00:30:20,682 --> 00:30:24,948
<i>You just never get any information out
of people you talk to, the youngsters.</i>

607
00:30:25,053 --> 00:30:27,180
<i>"Hey, what are you doing?"
"Just chilling. "</i>

608
00:30:27,689 --> 00:30:30,317
<i>All right.
I know, you're chilling.</i>

609
00:30:31,392 --> 00:30:35,829
<i>"What're you doing tonight?"
"Things. " "Okay. "</i>

610
00:30:35,930 --> 00:30:38,194
<i>I like dumb people, you know.
They like to talk to you.</i>

611
00:30:38,299 --> 00:30:40,767
<i>"Hey, what's going on?"
"I like lollypops. "</i>

612
00:30:42,303 --> 00:30:43,270
<i>"Good. "</i>

613
00:30:46,808 --> 00:30:49,402
<i>"My favorite color
is butterscotch. "</i>

614
00:30:50,411 --> 00:30:55,508
Do you ever get tired of singing the
same songs, you know, over and over?

615
00:30:56,384 --> 00:30:59,080
Do you ever get tired
of talking about your dick?

616
00:31:00,188 --> 00:31:02,622
<i>Yeah, I don't like... I
don't like blowjobs very much.</i>

617
00:31:02,724 --> 00:31:04,487
<i>I don't like... A lot of
guys like the blowjobs,</i>

618
00:31:04,592 --> 00:31:08,119
<i>I don't love them. I never know
what to do with my hands. You know?</i>

619
00:31:08,229 --> 00:31:10,026
<i>I'm always like...</i>

620
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:16,960
<i>You can either go hands on
the hips or the salute is fun.</i>

621
00:31:20,942 --> 00:31:22,409
<i>Yeah, it's always shocking
when a girl blows you.</i>

622
00:31:22,510 --> 00:31:24,637
<i>You're like, "Really?
You want to do it? All right. "</i>

623
00:31:25,213 --> 00:31:26,874
<i>I got some advice
for the ladies out there.</i>

624
00:31:26,981 --> 00:31:31,384
<i>When you are performing that
act on a fellow don't ever say,</i>

625
00:31:31,486 --> 00:31:34,546
<i>"You know, you're the first guy I
ever got the whole thing in my mouth.</i>

626
00:31:36,457 --> 00:31:41,690
<i>"Normally, normally, I get, like, halfway
down and I just start fucking choking,</i>

627
00:31:42,196 --> 00:31:47,065
<i>"but with you,
I got a ball in my mouth!</i>

628
00:31:47,268 --> 00:31:49,133
<i>"That's never happened!</i>

629
00:31:50,405 --> 00:31:56,071
<i>"Look, I have him in my mouth right
now, and I'm speaking perfectly clear.</i>

630
00:31:57,679 --> 00:31:59,772
<i>"Normally I have a stutter. "</i>

631
00:32:01,649 --> 00:32:04,641
That wasn't a pee, that was
a shit. That took too long.

632
00:32:04,752 --> 00:32:06,743
Here's 1,000 bucks.
Good job.

633
00:32:06,854 --> 00:32:08,617
Thank you so much, man.

634
00:32:08,723 --> 00:32:10,953
I've never made this much money
doing anything, man. Thank you.

635
00:32:11,059 --> 00:32:14,358
Good. I'm thinking about
doing a lot more stand-up.

636
00:32:14,462 --> 00:32:15,429
Okay.

637
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:17,794
And my assistant
got pregnant.

638
00:32:17,899 --> 00:32:20,231
I didn't even know she... I
thought she was a fucking lesbian

639
00:32:20,335 --> 00:32:21,302
the whole time, but...

640
00:32:21,402 --> 00:32:22,630
They can get
pregnant, too.

641
00:32:23,771 --> 00:32:25,136
That's nice. That's very nice. Yeah.

642
00:32:25,239 --> 00:32:28,731
So, you want to kind
of assist me, you know?

643
00:32:28,843 --> 00:32:29,935
Yeah! Yeah.
I mean, not, not...

644
00:32:30,044 --> 00:32:31,272
I mean, you can write
jokes for me, too,

645
00:32:31,379 --> 00:32:32,368
but get me sodas...

646
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,447
Whatever you need, man!

647
00:32:33,548 --> 00:32:35,209
...and, like, clean
my shit up and... Yeah.

648
00:32:35,316 --> 00:32:36,806
How much money
you make now?

649
00:32:36,918 --> 00:32:38,351
It depends
on how many hours.

650
00:32:38,453 --> 00:32:39,715
Usually,
I can get about...

651
00:32:39,821 --> 00:32:41,550
I'll give you
1,500 bucks a week.

652
00:32:41,656 --> 00:32:43,283
That's amazing, man.
Thank you so much.

653
00:32:43,391 --> 00:32:44,790
You want to fuck
these two girls?

654
00:32:46,294 --> 00:32:48,762
Hey, the JT.

655
00:32:49,397 --> 00:32:51,024
George. That was the
best. You killed them.

656
00:32:51,132 --> 00:32:52,099
Ira.

657
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,361
Hello. Yes, Mr. Taylor. Yes, hello.

658
00:32:54,769 --> 00:32:55,793
You wanna fuck
these girls?

659
00:32:55,903 --> 00:32:59,999
I filled my quota
in 1982, I believe.

660
00:33:00,108 --> 00:33:01,234
All right, I'll have
to figure this shit out.

661
00:33:01,342 --> 00:33:02,331
I know those girls.

662
00:33:02,443 --> 00:33:04,138
You do? Do you want to meet those girls?

663
00:33:04,245 --> 00:33:06,770
Will you fucking settle down?
Yeah, talk to them. Be gentle.

664
00:33:06,981 --> 00:33:10,109
You're twitching like a fucking
madman. That guy in porno?

665
00:33:10,618 --> 00:33:12,176
No. I would know.
No?

666
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,974
Mandy.
Well, hi there.

667
00:33:18,075 --> 00:33:20,100
You're still swimming?
Get the fuck out of there.

668
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:21,905
I'm ready for you.

669
00:33:22,012 --> 00:33:23,343
Yeah. Oh, my God.

670
00:33:25,749 --> 00:33:27,546
Oh, God. Feel that stomach. Oh. Yeah.

671
00:33:27,651 --> 00:33:29,175
I like that thing.
Good. Well, go for it.

672
00:33:29,286 --> 00:33:30,719
It's hard. Bam!

673
00:33:33,424 --> 00:33:34,721
This house is crazy.

674
00:33:34,825 --> 00:33:36,087
Oh, yeah, you got to
see the whole thing.

675
00:33:36,193 --> 00:33:37,922
Come here.
It came furnished.

676
00:33:38,028 --> 00:33:39,017
Really?

677
00:33:40,197 --> 00:33:43,428
That's my man, Ira. He wrote a lot
of good jokes for me there, honey.

678
00:33:43,534 --> 00:33:46,332
Make sure he shows you his
cock. It's very, very thick.

679
00:33:47,538 --> 00:33:49,005
See you, George.

680
00:33:54,712 --> 00:33:57,203
Hey, wanna have a contest to see who
can hold their breath the longest?

681
00:34:10,227 --> 00:34:11,854
You didn't go under.

682
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:15,962
Nothing's gonna
happen between us.

683
00:34:18,168 --> 00:34:20,932
I can't believe I'm having
sex with George Simmons.

684
00:34:21,205 --> 00:34:23,469
Yeah, he can't
believe it, either.

685
00:34:23,807 --> 00:34:26,207
My dad loves
your movies.

686
00:34:26,310 --> 00:34:29,939
Yeah, that's the best when
you talk about your dad.

687
00:34:38,689 --> 00:34:41,249
<i>Dad, this won't
bring Mom back!</i>

688
00:34:41,358 --> 00:34:44,350
<i>I have nothing else!</i>

689
00:34:44,461 --> 00:34:47,225
<i>You're a champion, Dad!
You're a champion!</i>

690
00:34:53,203 --> 00:34:54,966
Oh! You're still here.

691
00:34:56,206 --> 00:34:57,764
I know that asshole.

692
00:34:58,909 --> 00:35:00,774
You two were just fucking,
huh? How'd that go?

693
00:35:00,878 --> 00:35:04,143
No, I have a boyfriend.
We already talked about it.

694
00:35:04,448 --> 00:35:06,006
Yeah. John.
Yeah.

695
00:35:06,550 --> 00:35:09,110
Your friend took off.
She thought you left, so...

696
00:35:09,219 --> 00:35:10,186
Really?

697
00:35:10,287 --> 00:35:11,515
That's what happens
in a big house.

698
00:35:11,622 --> 00:35:12,919
It's called "the big house problem. "

699
00:35:13,023 --> 00:35:15,617
Your friend actually left
her purse down the hall.

700
00:35:15,726 --> 00:35:17,159
You want to go
get it with me?

701
00:35:17,261 --> 00:35:18,228
Oh. Okay.

702
00:35:23,534 --> 00:35:25,195
Don't you leave
on me, Ira.

703
00:35:25,736 --> 00:35:26,896
Fuck me like MerMan!

704
00:35:27,004 --> 00:35:30,303
Come on! Do MerMan!
Do the MerMan call!

705
00:35:30,674 --> 00:35:31,641
Come on!

706
00:35:31,742 --> 00:35:34,643
Oh, yeah!
Yeah! Oh, God!

707
00:35:39,716 --> 00:35:41,081
Hey.
Oh. Hey.

708
00:35:41,685 --> 00:35:43,778
Sorry about
the chick, man. I...

709
00:35:43,887 --> 00:35:46,287
You weren't getting it done,
so something had to happen.

710
00:35:46,390 --> 00:35:48,449
Oh, that's... No, she...
I wasn't even trying.

711
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:50,288
She told me
she had a boyfriend.

712
00:35:50,694 --> 00:35:53,288
Oh, yeah. She told me
she had a boyfriend, too.

713
00:35:53,397 --> 00:35:56,161
<i>When she
was sucking my cock!</i>

714
00:36:00,737 --> 00:36:02,728
What the fuck are you doing
with that big dick of yours?

715
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:06,003
You gotta use it! You gotta
share Thickie with the world.

716
00:36:06,109 --> 00:36:07,770
I don't... It's normal.

717
00:36:07,878 --> 00:36:11,211
You want to go upstairs, man? Talk
to me while I try to fall asleep?

718
00:36:12,149 --> 00:36:14,617
Okay, if... Yeah, if that's
what you want me to do.

719
00:36:15,686 --> 00:36:19,986
Yeah, yeah. Sit down,
man. That was a fun night.

720
00:36:20,557 --> 00:36:21,546
That was a good night.

721
00:36:21,658 --> 00:36:22,625
Yeah, that was crazy.

722
00:36:22,726 --> 00:36:23,693
Yeah.

723
00:36:23,794 --> 00:36:26,558
So, you slept with
both those girls, man.

724
00:36:27,497 --> 00:36:28,657
How did you do that?

725
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:30,861
How did I do that?
There's this...

726
00:36:30,968 --> 00:36:34,927
Girls like famous guys. It's a story
for them, I guess. I don't know.

727
00:36:35,038 --> 00:36:36,733
I take advantage
of it, though.

728
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,933
Believe me, they always
leave disappointed.

729
00:36:39,543 --> 00:36:41,477
That's amazing.

730
00:36:43,780 --> 00:36:46,442
Yeah, yeah, so let me hear
about this name, Ira Wright.

731
00:36:46,550 --> 00:36:48,415
That's not your
real name, right?

732
00:36:49,086 --> 00:36:50,212
How could you tell?

733
00:36:51,455 --> 00:36:53,480
You're hiding some Judaism.

734
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,455
No, my real
last name is Wiener.

735
00:36:55,559 --> 00:36:57,288
It's Ira Wiener
and everyone...

736
00:36:57,394 --> 00:37:01,330
It's spelled the same as "wiener" and
I just got tired of correcting people.

737
00:37:01,431 --> 00:37:03,729
So, that's what led you
to the path of comedy.

738
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:06,894
Being humiliated every day.
First day of school,

739
00:37:07,004 --> 00:37:08,995
"Is Ira Wiener here?"

740
00:37:09,106 --> 00:37:10,073
And you were in the back.

741
00:37:10,173 --> 00:37:13,734
"Wiener. My name's Wiener. "

742
00:37:13,844 --> 00:37:16,244
You little fruit.
What were your parents like?

743
00:37:16,346 --> 00:37:19,315
What are the older
"Wieners" or Wieners like?

744
00:37:20,317 --> 00:37:21,341
My parents are divorced.

745
00:37:21,451 --> 00:37:26,286
They hate each other. My mother
thinks my father's the devil.

746
00:37:27,624 --> 00:37:29,785
I don't know what that
makes me, technically, but...

747
00:37:30,227 --> 00:37:32,320
So, you'll never
be as funny as me.

748
00:37:32,429 --> 00:37:33,418
Why not?

749
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:36,522
Your generation has the
divorces, which is cute-funny,

750
00:37:36,633 --> 00:37:42,196
but my generation has the, "Oh, my God,
my father's about to hit me with a bat!"

751
00:37:43,373 --> 00:37:48,811
I just... You gotta break out the funny a
lot quicker than your little faggy childhood.

752
00:37:50,847 --> 00:37:52,371
Are you serious?

753
00:37:52,482 --> 00:37:55,883
I spent my whole childhood
trying to make my father laugh.

754
00:37:56,553 --> 00:37:59,386
I still haven't succeeded,
but we'll get there.

755
00:38:04,962 --> 00:38:08,728
Don't bail on me yet.
Keep it coming.

756
00:38:09,466 --> 00:38:11,491
When's the first time
you fingered a girl?

757
00:38:11,601 --> 00:38:14,866
I was at summer camp, Jewish
summer camp, on the sports field.

758
00:38:17,641 --> 00:38:22,374
And her name
was Sharon Mizrahi.

759
00:38:23,146 --> 00:38:26,377
I didn't know what to do.
I got really scared.

760
00:38:26,483 --> 00:38:30,214
She reached down and
grabbed my penis really hard,

761
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:32,151
like she was just
trying to murder it.

762
00:38:42,466 --> 00:38:43,797
Morning.
Yeah, baby.

763
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:46,767
It took me three hours, but
I think I found your kitchen.

764
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:49,067
Am I in the bathroom still? Is that it?

765
00:38:49,172 --> 00:38:51,538
No, no. You're good. You're safe.

766
00:38:51,675 --> 00:38:52,642
What do you
got there?

767
00:38:52,743 --> 00:38:54,904
This is medicine, Ira.
I'm sick.

768
00:38:55,012 --> 00:38:57,674
One of those girls have chlamydia?
I thought she smelled funny.

769
00:38:57,781 --> 00:38:59,408
Is that what it is?
Yeah.

770
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:04,978
I have a weird blood disease.
AML. It's a form of leukemia.

771
00:39:05,722 --> 00:39:08,418
This is experimental
medicine from Canada.

772
00:39:09,159 --> 00:39:14,119
There's an 8% chance
of it working. So, fuck me.

773
00:39:14,564 --> 00:39:16,930
Well, that's not true
'cause if it was,

774
00:39:17,034 --> 00:39:18,661
I would've read about it
or heard about that.

775
00:39:18,769 --> 00:39:19,861
You didn't hear
about it because

776
00:39:19,970 --> 00:39:22,962
<i>I didn't fucking run out and
tell Entertainment Tonight.</i>

777
00:39:23,073 --> 00:39:24,904
Well, why would
you tell me?

778
00:39:25,008 --> 00:39:26,805
'Cause I don't
really know you, Ira.

779
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:30,038
I think you're not gonna
get too weird about this.

780
00:39:30,147 --> 00:39:33,480
I don't want to start getting
treated like the guy who's gonna die.

781
00:39:33,784 --> 00:39:37,880
So, anyways, this shit's
got a lot of caffeine in it.

782
00:39:37,988 --> 00:39:40,923
They say that's good for you.
Let me take the medicine.

783
00:39:41,024 --> 00:39:42,548
Why are you telling
me this, George?

784
00:39:42,659 --> 00:39:45,492
'Cause I want you
to possibly do me a favor.

785
00:39:45,595 --> 00:39:46,789
Okay. Yeah. What?

786
00:39:47,597 --> 00:39:48,689
Kill me.

787
00:39:49,466 --> 00:39:50,433
What?

788
00:39:50,534 --> 00:39:51,660
Nobody knows
we know each other.

789
00:39:51,768 --> 00:39:54,328
You're a stranger.
You can get away with this.

790
00:39:54,438 --> 00:39:57,566
I got a gun in the other
room. It's untraceable.

791
00:39:57,674 --> 00:40:00,666
I'll give you $50,000.

792
00:40:00,777 --> 00:40:06,807
Don't make me suffer. Please,
kill me, Ira. I'm begging you.

793
00:40:07,117 --> 00:40:09,108
Can you at least give me,
like, a night to think about it?

794
00:40:09,219 --> 00:40:10,345
Ha!

795
00:40:10,454 --> 00:40:12,445
Think about it?
You would do it!

796
00:40:12,556 --> 00:40:15,218
Oh, I hate you, man.
Oh, no!

797
00:40:15,325 --> 00:40:20,991
Ira, I misread you. You're
sick! You're a murderer!

798
00:40:21,098 --> 00:40:22,087
Screw you, man.

799
00:40:22,199 --> 00:40:23,188
You wanted to do it!

800
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,791
What would you have done for
$100,000? Chop my head off?

801
00:40:25,902 --> 00:40:27,369
You would still
want to do it!

802
00:40:27,471 --> 00:40:29,200
That wasn't even
good acting over there!

803
00:40:29,306 --> 00:40:30,603
What the fuck?
That was good acting.

804
00:40:30,707 --> 00:40:32,698
Daniel Day-Lewis would've
crushed that speech.

805
00:40:32,809 --> 00:40:35,403
I bought that, man. Wow!

806
00:40:35,512 --> 00:40:38,743
Ira, you don't have to
kill me, but I am gonna die.

807
00:40:39,149 --> 00:40:40,980
George, look. Honestly, I'm
like... Don't get close, Ira.

808
00:40:41,084 --> 00:40:42,574
...a really gullible guy.
Don't do this.

809
00:40:42,686 --> 00:40:44,017
Look, my friends, they
trick me all the time.

810
00:40:44,121 --> 00:40:45,782
One of my roommates told me
he was Joe Pesci's son.

811
00:40:45,889 --> 00:40:48,380
I believed him for three
years. I still get shit for it,

812
00:40:48,492 --> 00:40:50,426
so just, please,
level with me, man.

813
00:40:50,527 --> 00:40:52,825
Are you serious?
I am serious, Ira.

814
00:40:53,363 --> 00:40:55,331
Don't tell anybody about
this though, all right?

815
00:40:55,432 --> 00:40:56,990
I want it to be
our secret.

816
00:40:57,100 --> 00:40:59,660
Now, you're gonna make me
some eggs. Okay, murderer?

817
00:41:00,203 --> 00:41:01,170
Don't say that.

818
00:41:01,271 --> 00:41:03,171
Just try not to kill
any of the staff

819
00:41:03,273 --> 00:41:05,969
while I'm gone, okay?
They have families.

820
00:41:06,743 --> 00:41:08,301
Well, he actually tricked me
first, but then he showed...

821
00:41:08,411 --> 00:41:09,605
I mean,
he's taking medicine.

822
00:41:09,713 --> 00:41:12,204
He's getting this special
medicine from Canada.

823
00:41:12,516 --> 00:41:14,381
Oh, my God, that's the
saddest thing I've ever heard.

824
00:41:14,484 --> 00:41:18,011
Yeah. I think I'm the
only person he's told.

825
00:41:18,121 --> 00:41:21,090
That's what he said. I mean, he's
really... He likes me, in a weird...

826
00:41:21,224 --> 00:41:23,852
I think he's, like, taken
a shine to me, you know.

827
00:41:23,960 --> 00:41:25,951
Not enough to let you in
on that two-on-one.

828
00:41:26,062 --> 00:41:27,359
Come on, that's
not appropriate.

829
00:41:27,464 --> 00:41:28,897
I don't want
that anyway.

830
00:41:30,734 --> 00:41:32,725
I just don't know.
I mean, it's...

831
00:41:32,836 --> 00:41:34,736
It's really scary.
I've never even...

832
00:41:34,838 --> 00:41:37,136
I don't think I've known
anyone who's, like, sick,

833
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,708
you know, in like a major way
before. I don't... I just...

834
00:41:39,809 --> 00:41:42,642
George Simmons. He's
been around my whole life.

835
00:41:42,746 --> 00:41:44,714
It's like Snap, Crackle
and Pop dying, you know?

836
00:41:44,814 --> 00:41:45,781
I know.

837
00:41:45,882 --> 00:41:47,474
Can we not talk
about this right now?

838
00:41:47,751 --> 00:41:49,878
I'm not really good
with the whole death thing.

839
00:41:49,986 --> 00:41:51,317
Is that all right?

840
00:41:51,421 --> 00:41:53,753
I need to talk about it, man.
I work for this guy now.

841
00:41:53,857 --> 00:41:55,984
I can't... I mean, that's all
I'm... It's all I'm thinking about.

842
00:41:56,092 --> 00:41:59,994
I'm gonna tell you this story that
makes me feel all right with death.

843
00:42:00,931 --> 00:42:03,661
When I was younger,
my grandfather died

844
00:42:03,767 --> 00:42:05,325
and we were all
gathered around him

845
00:42:05,435 --> 00:42:08,632
and there was this one
candle next to his bed.

846
00:42:08,738 --> 00:42:13,937
And right after he died, the candle started
flickering and then it just went out.

847
00:42:14,411 --> 00:42:15,435
Wow.
Yeah.

848
00:42:15,545 --> 00:42:18,309
And we looked around,
and there were no windows.

849
00:42:18,882 --> 00:42:21,407
Like, nothing
in that room.

850
00:42:22,152 --> 00:42:24,677
And it sounds crazy,
but we all thought

851
00:42:24,788 --> 00:42:27,120
it was him going
to heaven, you know?

852
00:42:27,224 --> 00:42:29,454
You don't pass through
fire to get to heaven.

853
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:30,526
I think he went to hell.

854
00:42:31,728 --> 00:42:33,286
What'd you just say?
- I just...

855
00:42:33,396 --> 00:42:35,091
I think your grandfather
probably went to hell.

856
00:42:35,198 --> 00:42:37,132
Don't do it. Are you
kidding me right now?

857
00:42:37,234 --> 00:42:38,826
I'm... I'm sorry
to break it to you.

858
00:42:38,935 --> 00:42:40,061
You're gonna make
fun of me right now,

859
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:42,195
just after I opened up
to you guys like that?

860
00:42:42,305 --> 00:42:44,000
It's not my fault your
grandfather's in hell.

861
00:42:44,107 --> 00:42:45,165
It's not a big deal.
Some grandpas go to hell.

862
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:47,749
Come on.
Don't be a jerk to me

863
00:42:47,861 --> 00:42:49,419
just because I make
more money than you guys.

864
00:42:49,529 --> 00:42:50,496
How much do you make again?

865
00:42:51,932 --> 00:42:54,901
You guys are just projecting
all your hatred onto me.

866
00:42:55,001 --> 00:42:56,400
Okay, and don't be
super bummed out

867
00:42:56,503 --> 00:42:59,404
'cause your grandfather's playing
backgammon with Hitler right now.

868
00:42:59,506 --> 00:43:00,996
Shit, dude, don't.

869
00:43:04,711 --> 00:43:06,338
I gotta get
rid of this stuff.

870
00:43:07,614 --> 00:43:10,139
Man, I don't know what
I'm gonna do with it.

871
00:43:11,184 --> 00:43:13,709
The more money you make, the
more free shit they give you.

872
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:18,280
It makes no sense. I don't see
any jet skiing in my near future.

873
00:43:18,391 --> 00:43:20,052
All this shit was free?

874
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,127
You want a TV, Ira?

875
00:43:21,227 --> 00:43:24,492
I got, like, three flat screens
laying around in there somewhere.

876
00:43:24,598 --> 00:43:27,761
Sure, I can... Yeah, I can just take
this stuff to Goodwill if you want or...

877
00:43:27,867 --> 00:43:30,597
You know what? Don't even
worry about this stuff. Let's...

878
00:43:30,704 --> 00:43:33,104
I got some cars in storage
you could sell for me

879
00:43:33,206 --> 00:43:35,231
and just give
that money to charity.

880
00:43:35,342 --> 00:43:36,309
I can do that, yeah.

881
00:43:36,409 --> 00:43:37,433
I'm gonna write
a list out for you,

882
00:43:37,544 --> 00:43:39,478
give you a bunch of
things I want you to do.

883
00:43:39,579 --> 00:43:40,705
What size sneaker are you?

884
00:43:40,814 --> 00:43:41,781
Eleven and a half.

885
00:43:41,881 --> 00:43:44,975
You got that thick cock, don't
you? I want to see that thing.

886
00:43:45,085 --> 00:43:46,780
Come on, pull the cock out.

887
00:43:46,886 --> 00:43:47,875
I'm not gonna
show it to you.

888
00:43:47,988 --> 00:43:48,955
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

889
00:43:49,055 --> 00:43:50,283
I'm not gonna do
anything with it.

890
00:43:50,390 --> 00:43:52,255
I just want to know
what I'm dealing with.

891
00:43:52,359 --> 00:43:53,417
If you give me an iPod.

892
00:43:53,526 --> 00:43:54,823
You asshole.

893
00:43:54,928 --> 00:43:56,361
All right, you can
have anything in here,

894
00:43:56,463 --> 00:43:58,363
<i>but you gotta take
the MerMan poster.</i>

895
00:43:58,465 --> 00:44:00,399
<i>No, I want...
I love MerMan!</i>

896
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:01,797
<i>I knew you loved MerMan.</i>

897
00:44:01,901 --> 00:44:03,835
<i>You and five-year-olds
love MerMan.</i>

898
00:44:04,504 --> 00:44:05,698
It's a smart movie.

899
00:44:07,674 --> 00:44:12,134
So, which, specifically, of the
cars belong to George Simmons?

900
00:44:12,779 --> 00:44:14,303
Which one?
Yeah.

901
00:44:14,414 --> 00:44:15,608
All of them.

902
00:44:16,082 --> 00:44:17,413
All of them?
Yeah.

903
00:44:17,517 --> 00:44:18,882
Well...

904
00:44:19,419 --> 00:44:21,387
How would I go
about selling?

905
00:44:22,322 --> 00:44:23,880
Selling them?
Yeah.

906
00:44:24,324 --> 00:44:27,054
Well, I don't know about selling
them but I can make a few disappear.

907
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:28,491
You know what I'm saying?

908
00:44:29,462 --> 00:44:30,793
I don't want
to do that.

909
00:44:30,897 --> 00:44:32,865
I don't want
to do that, either.

910
00:44:33,099 --> 00:44:34,532
Just kidding.

911
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:43,604
<i>Scene D is up! Let's go
on a bell. Yo Teach...!</i>

912
00:44:44,811 --> 00:44:46,005
And action!

913
00:44:46,112 --> 00:44:48,012
All right now...
Bradford!

914
00:44:48,114 --> 00:44:49,741
Yeah?
What is this?

915
00:44:51,768 --> 00:44:53,030
Bo's English test.

916
00:44:53,135 --> 00:44:54,466
Well, there's
a mistake.

917
00:44:55,404 --> 00:44:57,065
Well, yeah, there
are lots of mistakes.

918
00:44:57,172 --> 00:44:58,799
That's why
there's an F on it.

919
00:44:58,908 --> 00:45:02,400
You know, if Bo doesn't pass, he
can't play in the big game Friday.

920
00:45:02,511 --> 00:45:04,138
<i>Either you
make this right,</i>

921
00:45:04,246 --> 00:45:09,081
<i>or you'll be spending the summer
teaching driver's ed. Honk, honk!</i>

922
00:45:10,386 --> 00:45:11,614
Shit.

923
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:13,017
I can't be a part of this. I'm not...

924
00:45:13,122 --> 00:45:14,350
Yeah. I'm gonna go.

925
00:45:15,758 --> 00:45:17,282
This is just so painful,
though, isn't it?

926
00:45:17,393 --> 00:45:19,691
Yes, I want to kill myself.

927
00:45:20,596 --> 00:45:23,087
So, where are you from, originally?
You just moved here, right?

928
00:45:23,198 --> 00:45:24,859
Yep. Delaware.

929
00:45:24,967 --> 00:45:27,868
Delaware! Our first
state in the Union.

930
00:45:27,970 --> 00:45:29,437
Yes, it is.

931
00:45:29,738 --> 00:45:31,865
That's great. No sales
tax in Delaware, right?

932
00:45:31,974 --> 00:45:33,635
Yeah, there's not.
That's weird.

933
00:45:33,742 --> 00:45:35,642
You know so much
about Delaware.

934
00:45:35,744 --> 00:45:37,336
You fucking Joe Biden?

935
00:45:37,446 --> 00:45:39,414
He's from Delaware.
See? I knew that.

936
00:45:40,516 --> 00:45:42,848
<i>Bo, you're a smart kid.
I've seen you rap.</i>

937
00:45:42,952 --> 00:45:44,078
<i>Yeah!
- All right?</i>

938
00:45:44,186 --> 00:45:46,677
<i>Now, I am willing to give you a
makeup exam on this, all right?</i>

939
00:45:46,789 --> 00:45:48,051
Do you like music?

940
00:45:48,157 --> 00:45:49,419
Did you just ask me
if I liked music?

941
00:45:49,525 --> 00:45:52,289
Yeah. That... I'm... I'm aware
that that's a weird question.

942
00:45:52,394 --> 00:45:54,157
It's like asking me
if I like food.

943
00:45:54,263 --> 00:45:56,254
That was my next question.

944
00:45:56,498 --> 00:45:57,863
Yes.
Good.

945
00:45:57,967 --> 00:46:01,562
Wilco. Do you like Wilco? Wilco's
playing at the Greek Theatre.

946
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:04,138
And I was just wondering if
you maybe wanted to go with me.

947
00:46:04,239 --> 00:46:06,503
Yeah. I'll go. I'd be
into that. I like Wilco.

948
00:46:06,609 --> 00:46:07,598
Great.

949
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:12,147
Okay, great, great. So, I guess
we will go to the show together.

950
00:46:12,247 --> 00:46:13,612
Not anymore.

951
00:46:14,717 --> 00:46:15,945
You serious?

952
00:46:16,819 --> 00:46:18,514
No, I'll go.
Oh, okay. Thank you.

953
00:46:18,621 --> 00:46:19,610
Just don't say
that ever again.

954
00:46:19,722 --> 00:46:20,689
Okay. I won't.

955
00:46:20,789 --> 00:46:22,279
<i>Yo, Teach!
Yeah?</i>

956
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:24,417
<i>Thanks.</i>

957
00:46:25,027 --> 00:46:25,994
<i>Word.</i>

958
00:46:26,595 --> 00:46:29,628
<i>Do-ra-mi, wiener</i>

959
00:46:29,663 --> 00:46:32,661
<i>Do-ra-mi, wiener</i>

960
00:46:32,768 --> 00:46:36,329
<i>My name is Wiener</i>

961
00:46:36,939 --> 00:46:40,033
<i>My name is Wiener
My name is Wiener</i>

962
00:46:40,142 --> 00:46:41,837
<i>Don't call me wiener</i>

963
00:46:42,211 --> 00:46:45,510
Whatever. You got any
jokes for me, dum-dum?

964
00:46:45,614 --> 00:46:47,673
Got some good ones,
I think, actually.

965
00:46:48,050 --> 00:46:51,542
I have a thing about how,
like, you're rich, you know,

966
00:46:51,654 --> 00:46:52,780
and so you bought
a private jet,

967
00:46:52,888 --> 00:46:54,048
but you're
afraid of flying,

968
00:46:54,156 --> 00:46:55,123
so you just
drive in it.

969
00:46:55,224 --> 00:46:56,418
Oh, that's funny.

970
00:46:56,525 --> 00:46:58,857
You just go to
drive-throughs and car washes.

971
00:46:58,961 --> 00:47:01,623
Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'll come up
with the ending, but that was good.

972
00:47:02,231 --> 00:47:05,792
I thought it could be funny about
your balls, you know, about how, like,

973
00:47:05,901 --> 00:47:09,337
you're getting older and you found
the first gray hair on your balls.

974
00:47:09,438 --> 00:47:11,668
And it really worried you, but
then you realized it was good

975
00:47:11,774 --> 00:47:14,140
'cause it made your balls
look distinguished and smart.

976
00:47:14,243 --> 00:47:17,701
Like, if you gave your balls a little tweed
jacket with elbow pads and a little pipe,

977
00:47:17,813 --> 00:47:21,943
your balls could be like a character
Kevin Kline would play in a movie.

978
00:47:22,051 --> 00:47:25,043
Yeah, that's funny, that's
funny. I could do that.

979
00:47:25,154 --> 00:47:26,178
What else you got?

980
00:47:26,288 --> 00:47:29,917
Actually, this just
kind of happened.

981
00:47:30,993 --> 00:47:33,427
I'm making you
an iTunes playlist.

982
00:47:33,529 --> 00:47:35,463
For what? Sometimes, when I'm upset,

983
00:47:35,564 --> 00:47:39,000
music makes me feel a little
better, so I thought maybe...

984
00:47:39,101 --> 00:47:40,625
Oh, it's
a cheer-me-up thing?

985
00:47:40,736 --> 00:47:41,896
I was gonna just
put it on your iPod.

986
00:47:42,004 --> 00:47:43,266
I don't have to
play it right now.

987
00:47:43,372 --> 00:47:45,203
For what? For when I go out
jogging? I don't need to...

988
00:47:45,307 --> 00:47:48,936
Let me hear it. I don't jog
anymore. Let me hear my playlist.

989
00:47:57,252 --> 00:48:00,312
Ira! Ira!

990
00:48:01,323 --> 00:48:03,154
Okay, you don't have
to make fun of it.

991
00:48:03,258 --> 00:48:05,021
No, Bob Marley!

992
00:48:05,127 --> 00:48:08,824
Yes. Everything is gonna be
all right. You're right, Ira.

993
00:48:08,931 --> 00:48:11,957
Bob Marley had cancer. Everything
wasn't all right for Bob Marley.

994
00:48:12,067 --> 00:48:13,398
He dead now.

995
00:48:13,502 --> 00:48:14,935
What else
you put on there for me?

996
00:48:15,037 --> 00:48:16,436
I really don't want
to do this, George.

997
00:48:16,538 --> 00:48:17,971
Can we just... I'II...
Just forget I did this.

998
00:48:18,073 --> 00:48:19,472
Ignore it.
I'll erase it, okay?

999
00:48:19,575 --> 00:48:23,534
No, no, no, don't do that. Let's hear
what's gonna cheer me up! This is good.

1000
00:48:23,645 --> 00:48:25,135
Come on. What else you got?

1001
00:48:25,247 --> 00:48:26,578
Okay, here's
the next one.

1002
00:48:27,750 --> 00:48:33,245
<i>Now I've had
the time of my life</i>

1003
00:48:33,355 --> 00:48:36,153
<i>No, I never felt
like this before</i>

1004
00:48:36,258 --> 00:48:37,657
I don't know what
to say to that one.

1005
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:41,355
That's... That's just...
That's just fifth grade and...

1006
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:44,899
Showing me your cock was
embarrassing, but this is okay?

1007
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:46,797
Oh, God.
That's a good song.

1008
00:48:46,902 --> 00:48:50,065
Yeah, what else? Give me more.
This is... This is unbelievable.

1009
00:48:50,172 --> 00:48:51,867
You sure you want
to hear another one?

1010
00:48:51,974 --> 00:48:52,963
I don't...
Yeah! Yeah, yeah.

1011
00:48:53,075 --> 00:48:55,043
This is fun
to be cheered up.

1012
00:48:55,144 --> 00:48:56,133
I'm sorry...

1013
00:49:01,316 --> 00:49:05,685
<i>Shadows are falling
And I'm running out of breath</i>

1014
00:49:06,822 --> 00:49:09,791
<i>Keep me in your heart
for a while</i>

1015
00:49:11,593 --> 00:49:16,360
<i>If I leave you, it doesn't
mean I love you any less</i>

1016
00:49:17,633 --> 00:49:20,693
<i>Keep me in your heart
for a while</i>

1017
00:49:22,371 --> 00:49:27,399
<i>When you get up in the morning
And you see that crazy sun</i>

1018
00:49:28,410 --> 00:49:31,402
<i>Keep me in your heart
for a while</i>

1019
00:49:33,382 --> 00:49:36,317
Just write me some jokes,
you stupid, fucking idiot.

1020
00:49:36,418 --> 00:49:37,976
Okay, I'm sorry.

1021
00:49:39,188 --> 00:49:42,180
<i>Keep me in your heart
for a while</i>

1022
00:49:43,425 --> 00:49:45,791
<i>So, I'm not married. I don't
think I'm ever gonna get married.</i>

1023
00:49:45,894 --> 00:49:47,919
<i>I just... I can't find
a reason to do it, you know?</i>

1024
00:49:48,030 --> 00:49:49,429
<i>Like, I got friends, like,</i>

1025
00:49:49,531 --> 00:49:51,328
<i>"You gotta get married.
My wife.</i>

1026
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,331
<i>"My wife is a...
She's the best cook.</i>

1027
00:49:53,435 --> 00:49:54,663
<i>"My wife's the... You gotta. "</i>

1028
00:49:54,770 --> 00:49:57,136
<i>And I'm like,
"My cook's the best cook. "</i>

1029
00:49:59,474 --> 00:50:01,533
<i>"But my wife,
she's my best friend. "</i>

1030
00:50:02,411 --> 00:50:04,709
<i>"Yeah, my cook's actually
a pretty good guy. " You know?</i>

1031
00:50:05,647 --> 00:50:07,478
This could be funny.

1032
00:50:07,583 --> 00:50:11,417
Like, your dad didn't like you, so
he named you and your dog George.

1033
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:13,511
<i>He'd be like, "Hey,
George, come in here!</i>

1034
00:50:13,922 --> 00:50:15,617
<i>"Not you, the dog. "</i>

1035
00:50:16,158 --> 00:50:18,524
"George, I... Look at this
awesome book I just got!"

1036
00:50:18,627 --> 00:50:20,117
And then you come in, it's
like, "Not you, the dog. "

1037
00:50:20,229 --> 00:50:21,218
That's funny.
Yeah.

1038
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:23,924
<i>"Hey, George, I made a nice steak
for you. " "Hey, thanks, Dad. "</i>

1039
00:50:24,032 --> 00:50:25,966
<i>"Not you, the dog. "</i>

1040
00:50:26,068 --> 00:50:27,968
<i>"Hey, George, I just put some peanut
butter on my balls. Come lick it up. You. "</i>

1041
00:50:32,358 --> 00:50:33,825
<i>Fuck him.</i>

1042
00:50:33,926 --> 00:50:39,262
<i>I miss the dry hump as a concept
in my life. It just doesn't...</i>

1043
00:50:39,365 --> 00:50:43,199
<i>I miss the dry hump 'cause you don't
need a big dick to be a good dry humper.</i>

1044
00:50:43,302 --> 00:50:46,294
<i>You just need a big thigh,
that's all you need.</i>

1045
00:50:46,405 --> 00:50:49,340
<i>Be able to get your thigh
in there real good.</i>

1046
00:50:49,441 --> 00:50:52,308
<i>I can thigh
the hell out of a girl.</i>

1047
00:50:52,411 --> 00:50:56,507
<i>Sexually, I'm completely terrible,
but I could do this all day.</i>

1048
00:50:57,216 --> 00:51:02,153
<i>I'm very rich, by the way. I know that
makes you feel good about your life.</i>

1049
00:51:02,254 --> 00:51:03,414
<i>I got so much.</i>

1050
00:51:03,522 --> 00:51:06,150
<i>"You have so much.
Why not me?"</i>

1051
00:51:06,258 --> 00:51:08,988
<i>I have people stop me on the
streets sometimes, just go,</i>

1052
00:51:09,094 --> 00:51:13,190
<i>"You have so much!"
"Yes, yes. " "Why not me?"</i>

1053
00:51:13,298 --> 00:51:14,265
<i>Like, "I don't know. "</i>

1054
00:51:14,366 --> 00:51:19,133
<i>"Why you? I came out
here to do what you do. "</i>

1055
00:51:19,238 --> 00:51:20,205
<i>"Well, you're not doing it. "</i>

1056
00:51:20,305 --> 00:51:22,136
<i>"No, I'm not!</i>

1057
00:51:22,241 --> 00:51:26,075
<i>"Fuck you! I want all your
money and all your whores. "</i>

1058
00:51:27,212 --> 00:51:29,203
<i>Airplanes are
the last public place</i>

1059
00:51:29,314 --> 00:51:31,782
<i>where you can fart as loud
as you want and no one cares.</i>

1060
00:51:32,217 --> 00:51:34,151
<i>'Cause they don't... It's
loud. There's engine noise.</i>

1061
00:51:34,253 --> 00:51:35,242
<i>They just don't
know it's you.</i>

1062
00:51:35,354 --> 00:51:37,982
<i>Like, you could literally be
talking to someone you just met</i>

1063
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:39,955
<i>and be sitting this
far away from them</i>

1064
00:51:40,058 --> 00:51:42,618
<i>and look them dead in the eye
as they talk about their grandson</i>

1065
00:51:42,728 --> 00:51:45,595
<i>and just fart as loud
as you humanly can. Just...</i>

1066
00:51:46,865 --> 00:51:49,299
<i>"Yeah? Where's
your grandson from?"</i>

1067
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:52,131
<i>My asshole's been open this
whole time. It's just still...</i>

1068
00:51:54,339 --> 00:51:58,105
Hey, can you help me with some of my
jokes when I... When I drop you off later?

1069
00:51:58,210 --> 00:51:59,609
Help you with some of your bits? Yeah.

1070
00:51:59,711 --> 00:52:01,645
No. I'm not gonna
help you, man.

1071
00:52:01,747 --> 00:52:04,147
No one helped me
when I started.

1072
00:52:04,249 --> 00:52:06,547
Fucking, I'm not paying to help
you, I'm paying you to help me.

1073
00:52:06,652 --> 00:52:08,517
No, okay. You're right, you're right.

1074
00:52:08,620 --> 00:52:12,215
<i>There is always the one girl out
there, though. The one that got away.</i>

1075
00:52:12,324 --> 00:52:17,227
<i>Guys have that and serial killers
have that. The one that got away.</i>

1076
00:52:17,329 --> 00:52:22,494
<i>"I had her, the trunk was
lined with garbage bags</i>

1077
00:52:22,601 --> 00:52:24,501
<i>"and then she got away. "</i>

1078
00:52:26,472 --> 00:52:28,872
<i>I'm sick of rap songs
telling me what to do.</i>

1079
00:52:30,242 --> 00:52:33,541
<i>"Bend over. Slap your ass,
girl. Drop it like it's hot. "</i>

1080
00:52:35,264 --> 00:52:36,390
<i>Yeah, I'm gonna
write a song back.</i>

1081
00:52:36,498 --> 00:52:40,901
<i>I'm gonna be, like,
"Boy, brush your teeth!</i>

1082
00:52:41,002 --> 00:52:46,372
<i>"Yeah, boy, bump that jacket off
your back. I'm fucking cold as shit!"</i>

1083
00:52:47,809 --> 00:52:49,174
<i>I masturbate so much
with hand cream,</i>

1084
00:52:49,277 --> 00:52:52,872
<i>I forget people use it for
shit other than masturbating.</i>

1085
00:52:52,981 --> 00:52:55,176
<i>Literally, when I'm in public and
I see someone pull out hand cream,</i>

1086
00:52:55,283 --> 00:52:58,013
<i>I'm like, "This guy's
about to jerk off!"</i>

1087
00:52:58,219 --> 00:52:59,243
Can I ask you
something?

1088
00:52:59,354 --> 00:53:03,586
Is your act just designed to make sure
no girl will ever sleep with you again?

1089
00:53:03,691 --> 00:53:06,888
All you fucking talk about
is jacking off and farting.

1090
00:53:06,995 --> 00:53:08,690
You think a girl's gonna
come up to you after the show,

1091
00:53:09,097 --> 00:53:11,964
"Could you just jack off for
me and then fart in my face?"

1092
00:53:12,067 --> 00:53:14,968
It's fucking insane! Do
you want to get laid, ever?

1093
00:53:24,612 --> 00:53:29,515
<i>How will you
people live without me?</i>

1094
00:53:31,086 --> 00:53:35,785
<i>Who will bring you joy
when I'm gone?</i>

1095
00:53:37,759 --> 00:53:41,752
<i>'Cause I'm one funny man</i>

1096
00:53:42,063 --> 00:53:45,191
<i>I bring the comedy</i>

1097
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:50,067
<i>I am the one you go to,
to get cheered up</i>

1098
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,937
<i>Put in my movies</i>

1099
00:53:56,044 --> 00:54:02,176
<i>Escape, if you will
To a land of loveliness</i>

1100
00:54:05,186 --> 00:54:08,155
<i>He doesn't have patience</i>

1101
00:54:08,256 --> 00:54:14,684
<i>He hates so many people
He's mad when others do well</i>

1102
00:54:14,963 --> 00:54:21,266
<i>He hates himself
Fuck George Simmons</i>

1103
00:54:21,703 --> 00:54:24,900
<i>He has a medium-sized penis</i>

1104
00:54:25,006 --> 00:54:29,875
<i>He fucked so many girls
And yet no one remembers</i>

1105
00:54:30,345 --> 00:54:33,439
<i>When he's done fucking them</i>

1106
00:54:33,681 --> 00:54:37,082
<i>The girl just
lays there and says</i>

1107
00:54:37,185 --> 00:54:42,088
<i>I should have fucked Jean-Claude
Van Damme instead of you</i>

1108
00:54:43,024 --> 00:54:48,087
<i>Fuck, yeah! Fuck, yeah!</i>

1109
00:54:49,764 --> 00:54:54,224
<i>George Simmons
soon will be gone</i>

1110
00:54:57,338 --> 00:55:00,603
<i>And he will not
miss you people at all.</i>

1111
00:55:02,076 --> 00:55:05,534
<i>Our relationship has
always been strained.</i>

1112
00:55:05,647 --> 00:55:10,516
<i>You always wanted too much from
me, and I'm very mad at you.</i>

1113
00:55:11,419 --> 00:55:15,913
<i>Leave me alone. Don't
visit my grave, cocksuckers.</i>

1114
00:55:17,492 --> 00:55:18,618
<i>Peace!</i>

1115
00:55:32,574 --> 00:55:34,041
<i>Oh, my God,
it's George Simmons!</i>

1116
00:55:34,943 --> 00:55:37,468
What are you doing here?
What's happening?

1117
00:55:37,579 --> 00:55:39,463
I couldn't sleep. I want
to get the Cavaliers game.

1118
00:55:39,498 --> 00:55:41,347
I couldn't sleep. I want
to get the Cavaliers game.

1119
00:55:41,449 --> 00:55:43,041
I can't get this
thing ever to work.

1120
00:55:43,151 --> 00:55:47,315
I was up all night, man. I had a
terrible sleep. I was sweating my ass off.

1121
00:55:47,422 --> 00:55:49,890
I'm fucking hot one second
and cold one second

1122
00:55:49,991 --> 00:55:52,858
<i>and the alc
don't work for shit.</i>

1123
00:55:52,961 --> 00:55:55,987
It's always going
up to the roof.

1124
00:55:56,097 --> 00:55:57,291
What time is it?

1125
00:55:57,398 --> 00:55:58,888
It says 3:00.

1126
00:55:59,734 --> 00:56:04,330
It's 3:00? God damn it! I can't
fucking waste time. I gotta...

1127
00:56:06,641 --> 00:56:09,132
All right,
let's start my goddamn day.

1128
00:56:10,111 --> 00:56:11,544
I don't got time
for this shit.

1129
00:56:11,646 --> 00:56:14,240
Let me have that
stupid clicker. Come on.

1130
00:56:16,784 --> 00:56:18,979
They keep telling me that
I gotta dial an extension.

1131
00:56:19,087 --> 00:56:22,955
I don't even have the fucking number
to dial for the fucking extension!

1132
00:56:23,057 --> 00:56:24,081
Do you want me
to try calling them?

1133
00:56:24,325 --> 00:56:25,792
You should have
fucking called them!

1134
00:56:25,893 --> 00:56:28,123
Where the fuck
were you last night?

1135
00:56:28,496 --> 00:56:29,520
You'll call them.

1136
00:56:29,631 --> 00:56:31,030
I'm sorry, man.

1137
00:56:31,132 --> 00:56:32,793
Just tell me what you need,
I'll get it done, okay?

1138
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:35,960
You pay for all of this stuff
and none of it ever works!

1139
00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:38,937
Nothing! I don't even think I'm sick!

1140
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,873
These guys are trying
to fucking kill me!

1141
00:56:42,644 --> 00:56:45,875
I want to go to the doctor.
I gotta see this guy.

1142
00:56:45,980 --> 00:56:48,346
What the fuck is happening?

1143
00:56:49,851 --> 00:56:53,184
This medicine does not work.
It makes it worse!

1144
00:56:53,288 --> 00:56:55,381
Okay. I'll call them right now.
I'll tell them we're coming, okay?

1145
00:56:55,490 --> 00:56:57,082
Now. We gotta go now.

1146
00:56:57,191 --> 00:56:58,283
I'll call them
right now, okay?

1147
00:56:58,393 --> 00:57:00,293
Yeah.
I'll meet you downstairs.

1148
00:57:08,936 --> 00:57:13,498
Please put away the video game.
Don't do that. Don't be rude.

1149
00:57:13,608 --> 00:57:14,575
I'm sorry.

1150
00:57:14,676 --> 00:57:15,643
<i>Fucking playing Centipede?</i>

1151
00:57:15,743 --> 00:57:17,074
What the fuck
were you playing?

1152
00:57:17,178 --> 00:57:18,941
Just a driving game.

1153
00:57:20,581 --> 00:57:21,570
Hello, Mr. Simmons.

1154
00:57:21,683 --> 00:57:22,650
Hey, yeah, Doctor,
good to see you.

1155
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:23,808
How are you?
I brought my friend.

1156
00:57:23,918 --> 00:57:28,048
This is my... Well, my lover,
my life partner, my everything.

1157
00:57:28,156 --> 00:57:30,681
How are you? What's
going on? How we doing?

1158
00:57:30,792 --> 00:57:33,852
Well, your immune system is in the
middle of a very serious battle.

1159
00:57:34,429 --> 00:57:36,294
The medicine is trying
to combat the disease,

1160
00:57:36,397 --> 00:57:38,797
but in the process
it destroys healthy tissue

1161
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:41,198
and disrupts healthy
functioning of your organs

1162
00:57:41,302 --> 00:57:43,770
and multiple
lymphatic systems,

1163
00:57:43,871 --> 00:57:45,998
so you're getting
attacked on two levels.

1164
00:57:46,341 --> 00:57:48,275
And we hope the disease
is vanquished

1165
00:57:48,376 --> 00:57:51,277
before it and the medicine does
damage which cannot be contained.

1166
00:57:51,713 --> 00:57:53,305
Okay.

1167
00:57:53,414 --> 00:57:55,041
Your accent
is very thick.

1168
00:57:56,584 --> 00:57:57,881
You ever notice
your accent

1169
00:57:57,985 --> 00:58:01,512
makes things sound worse than
they... Than they actually are?

1170
00:58:02,023 --> 00:58:04,218
You could give good news,
and I'd still be like,

1171
00:58:04,325 --> 00:58:06,020
"What happened?
Am I still dying?"

1172
00:58:06,961 --> 00:58:08,394
I'm just trying
to help you.

1173
00:58:08,796 --> 00:58:11,094
I know you sound like a
regular Joe where you come from,

1174
00:58:11,199 --> 00:58:17,069
but here I keep thinking you're
gonna be torturing James Bond later.

1175
00:58:17,171 --> 00:58:21,073
I'm sure your sense of humor will
serve you well in this situation.

1176
00:58:21,476 --> 00:58:26,072
There he goes again. All so terrifying
because it came out of your mouth.

1177
00:58:26,581 --> 00:58:28,412
You are a very funny man.

1178
00:58:28,516 --> 00:58:30,780
<i>Are you mad that you died
at the end of Die Hard?</i>

1179
00:58:31,219 --> 00:58:33,653
I don't understand
the reference.

1180
00:58:35,123 --> 00:58:37,284
<i>He kind of looks like those two
guys in the second Matrix movie.</i>

1181
00:58:38,893 --> 00:58:41,020
<i>I assure you I was
not in The Matrix.</i>

1182
00:58:41,129 --> 00:58:44,155
Why did you eat Bjrn Borg?
What did he do to you?

1183
00:58:44,265 --> 00:58:48,031
If you have no other questions,
I do have other patients.

1184
00:58:48,136 --> 00:58:52,072
You have other patients that you have
to frighten by the end of the day?

1185
00:58:52,173 --> 00:58:53,640
How many patients
do you frighten a day?

1186
00:58:53,741 --> 00:58:56,608
And I am slowly getting
a little bit annoyed

1187
00:58:56,711 --> 00:59:00,408
by these humorous
activities from you guys.

1188
00:59:01,215 --> 00:59:02,182
So, I think you and...

1189
00:59:02,283 --> 00:59:03,807
We have discussed
this and I am very,

1190
00:59:03,918 --> 00:59:06,352
very sympathetic
to your recovery,

1191
00:59:06,587 --> 00:59:09,988
and I hope we will succeed
with what we are doing.

1192
00:59:10,091 --> 00:59:12,616
I've been trying to build this
cabinet I bought from you guys

1193
00:59:12,727 --> 00:59:14,888
for, like, six months
and I gotta...

1194
00:59:14,996 --> 00:59:16,861
IKEA? That's very funny.

1195
00:59:27,275 --> 00:59:29,175
Hey. Yo, Teach.
Hey.

1196
00:59:30,978 --> 00:59:32,673
How's... How was the taping?

1197
00:59:32,780 --> 00:59:35,544
Great. Great, yeah.
I'm happy with it.

1198
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:37,242
I think the ending
really murdered.

1199
00:59:37,351 --> 00:59:40,149
Was it a very
special episode?

1200
00:59:41,856 --> 00:59:44,290
You remember
Daisy, right?

1201
00:59:44,392 --> 00:59:45,620
Yeah, of course.

1202
00:59:46,127 --> 00:59:47,151
Hey.

1203
00:59:47,261 --> 00:59:48,523
I'm sorry.

1204
00:59:48,629 --> 00:59:50,256
I didn't know you'd
be coming home tonight.

1205
00:59:50,364 --> 00:59:53,060
I thought maybe you'd be spending
the night at George's and...

1206
00:59:53,167 --> 00:59:57,103
Guess it's been
more than 10 days, huh?

1207
00:59:57,205 --> 01:00:00,766
Yeah,
I gave you an extra 11.

1208
01:00:00,875 --> 01:00:02,001
What are you guys
talking about?

1209
01:00:02,109 --> 01:00:03,940
Nothing. Doesn't matter. It's cool.

1210
01:00:04,045 --> 01:00:06,206
Don't give a shit.
Totally fine.

1211
01:00:11,118 --> 01:00:13,313
<i>Hey. I saw the new
Harry Potter movie.</i>

1212
01:00:15,022 --> 01:00:16,011
Harry's getting old.

1213
01:00:16,123 --> 01:00:17,090
He's, like,
older than my dad.

1214
01:00:17,191 --> 01:00:18,658
They should call
him Harold Potter.

1215
01:00:19,527 --> 01:00:21,620
That Hermione's got
some big, old titties.

1216
01:00:25,533 --> 01:00:26,727
Whoa!

1217
01:00:26,834 --> 01:00:30,770
Did you two just bone? I'm
getting a little vibe here.

1218
01:00:30,872 --> 01:00:33,773
This is exciting. Think
I'm getting a quarter chub.

1219
01:00:35,376 --> 01:00:36,707
Why is Ira so upset?

1220
01:00:36,811 --> 01:00:39,177
It's been, like,
way after 10 days.

1221
01:00:39,280 --> 01:00:42,340
He can't call dibs
on every girl he meets.

1222
01:00:42,717 --> 01:00:45,208
We were supposed to go out
on a date together.

1223
01:00:45,319 --> 01:00:47,947
We are going out on
a date. I thought so.

1224
01:00:48,055 --> 01:00:49,215
We're not anymore! No!

1225
01:00:49,323 --> 01:00:50,312
Really?

1226
01:00:50,424 --> 01:00:54,520
'Cause after you fuck my roommate
that kind of ends it with me!

1227
01:00:54,662 --> 01:00:56,630
What are you talking about?
Don't treat me like that.

1228
01:00:57,131 --> 01:01:00,328
Just so you know how I'm
seeing you? You're a starfucker.

1229
01:01:00,434 --> 01:01:02,732
You're a girl who met
a star and then fucked him.

1230
01:01:02,837 --> 01:01:04,498
And he's not even
that famous!

1231
01:01:04,605 --> 01:01:07,768
What if like a real good-looking
celebrity was my roommate?

1232
01:01:07,875 --> 01:01:11,834
What if I lived with, you know,
James McAvoy or Jude Law or something?

1233
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:14,678
I don't know. I probably would
fuck both of those people.

1234
01:01:14,782 --> 01:01:15,749
Don't say that.

1235
01:01:15,850 --> 01:01:17,442
I'm sorry! Lower the bar a little bit.

1236
01:01:17,718 --> 01:01:19,242
I can't believe that!

1237
01:01:20,955 --> 01:01:26,188
If a hot girl walked over here, naked,
and was like, "Do my body," you would.

1238
01:01:26,327 --> 01:01:27,692
You would have
sex with her.

1239
01:01:27,795 --> 01:01:30,161
No, I'd feel
really uncomfortable.

1240
01:01:30,298 --> 01:01:32,596
And then I might ask
her to a Wilco show.

1241
01:01:32,700 --> 01:01:37,069
Okay, then you're the first guy in the
world that I've ever met that's like that.

1242
01:01:37,572 --> 01:01:40,132
I thought you were the kind of
girl that would wait two months

1243
01:01:40,241 --> 01:01:41,265
and then have
sex with a guy.

1244
01:01:41,375 --> 01:01:42,342
I didn't think
you would just...

1245
01:01:42,443 --> 01:01:44,502
I'm an independent woman.

1246
01:01:44,612 --> 01:01:47,080
I'm allowed
to fuck people.

1247
01:01:47,381 --> 01:01:50,318
Well, if I had known that, I would
have scheduled our date a lot sooner!

1248
01:01:52,153 --> 01:01:54,587
Give me a break.
I don't even know you.

1249
01:01:54,789 --> 01:01:57,724
This is the longest
conversation we've ever had.

1250
01:02:03,598 --> 01:02:08,467
Don't be mad at me. I
said I'd give you 10 days.

1251
01:02:08,569 --> 01:02:10,059
I gave you three weeks.

1252
01:02:13,474 --> 01:02:14,702
I thought you
were joking, man.

1253
01:02:14,809 --> 01:02:17,277
I'm gonna be
honest with you.

1254
01:02:17,378 --> 01:02:20,176
We... We... We want to fuck
every girl that we meet.

1255
01:02:21,549 --> 01:02:22,516
That's how it works.

1256
01:02:22,617 --> 01:02:25,643
If I didn't sleep with every girl
you wished you could sleep with,

1257
01:02:25,753 --> 01:02:27,345
I wouldn't sleep
with anybody.

1258
01:02:27,455 --> 01:02:29,980
It's a communication
breakdown. We can fix this.

1259
01:02:30,524 --> 01:02:32,321
I don't care. The fact
that you had sex with her...

1260
01:02:32,426 --> 01:02:36,760
I can never do anything
like that with her.

1261
01:02:36,864 --> 01:02:41,164
So, you're really not gonna chase
this girl just because I was with her?

1262
01:02:41,268 --> 01:02:42,326
Yeah.

1263
01:02:43,070 --> 01:02:44,128
Huh.

1264
01:02:45,006 --> 01:02:47,133
It's kind of insulting,
on some level.

1265
01:02:49,977 --> 01:02:52,309
Wanna go to Wilco with me?

1266
01:02:53,147 --> 01:02:56,139
I wish I could, but I'm
going with Tobey Maguire.

1267
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:58,844
I might play his little
brother in this movie.

1268
01:03:03,958 --> 01:03:05,516
I hope I get it.

1269
01:03:10,564 --> 01:03:14,056
Give me something. You didn't get
rid of them. What did you get rid of?

1270
01:03:14,168 --> 01:03:15,897
Well, I, you know,
I got a few good offers,

1271
01:03:16,003 --> 01:03:18,437
but honestly, I don't know how
much each car is worth and I...

1272
01:03:18,539 --> 01:03:20,404
They keep on wanting
to buy all of them

1273
01:03:20,508 --> 01:03:21,907
and it's hard for me to...
Don't make it a big deal.

1274
01:03:22,009 --> 01:03:24,842
Don't get a stomach-ache
over it. Just sell them.

1275
01:03:24,945 --> 01:03:26,139
Give it to a charity.
Move on.

1276
01:03:26,247 --> 01:03:27,214
Okay.

1277
01:03:27,381 --> 01:03:28,575
I just want to be
happy about

1278
01:03:28,683 --> 01:03:29,707
giving something
away, you know.

1279
01:03:29,817 --> 01:03:30,784
Okay.

1280
01:03:30,885 --> 01:03:31,852
So...

1281
01:03:33,487 --> 01:03:36,081
There's something I've really
been wanting to tell you, George.

1282
01:03:36,190 --> 01:03:37,282
Uh-oh.

1283
01:03:38,092 --> 01:03:39,320
Yeah.

1284
01:03:39,427 --> 01:03:43,921
I feel as though you need to tell someone
other than me about your condition.

1285
01:03:45,599 --> 01:03:47,066
I don't want to do that.

1286
01:03:47,168 --> 01:03:48,601
George,
people care about you.

1287
01:03:48,703 --> 01:03:50,671
You have to let them
be there for you.

1288
01:03:51,639 --> 01:03:55,439
I tell somebody, then it's all gonna
change, and you can't get it back.

1289
01:03:56,243 --> 01:03:58,074
Everything's
already changed, George,

1290
01:03:58,179 --> 01:04:02,343
and the truth is soon you're
gonna start getting very sick

1291
01:04:02,450 --> 01:04:04,509
and you are gonna want
someone other than me there.

1292
01:04:05,052 --> 01:04:07,247
I mean, have you... Have you
even told your parents yet?

1293
01:04:07,354 --> 01:04:09,447
My parents are
in their mid-70s.

1294
01:04:09,557 --> 01:04:12,219
They would drop dead
if they heard about this.

1295
01:04:12,326 --> 01:04:14,123
Friends. You must want
to tell your friends.

1296
01:04:14,228 --> 01:04:16,253
I don't really
have any friends.

1297
01:04:16,363 --> 01:04:18,661
I have people I shoot the
shit with and fuck around with,

1298
01:04:18,766 --> 01:04:20,563
but there's nobody
I'm really close with.

1299
01:04:20,668 --> 01:04:22,101
I've got showbiz friends.

1300
01:04:22,203 --> 01:04:25,639
Andy Dick isn't a friend.
He's just a guy you know.

1301
01:04:25,740 --> 01:04:28,208
You're my closest friend,
and I don't even like you.

1302
01:04:29,410 --> 01:04:31,469
You have to tell
someone other than me, man.

1303
01:04:31,579 --> 01:04:33,240
I can't be
the only one who knows.

1304
01:04:33,347 --> 01:04:34,780
I've never dealt
with anything like this.

1305
01:04:34,882 --> 01:04:37,248
All my grandparents
are alive.

1306
01:04:37,351 --> 01:04:40,718
Listen, this is not your job
to cry. Your job is to not cry.

1307
01:04:40,821 --> 01:04:43,756
I'm just trying to talk
to you man-to-man, George.

1308
01:04:43,891 --> 01:04:45,859
As a man, you are
crying right now.

1309
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:46,949
I'm not crying.

1310
01:04:47,061 --> 01:04:49,325
People are gonna think we just
broke up or something, Ira.

1311
01:04:49,430 --> 01:04:51,091
Stop doing what
you're doing.

1312
01:04:51,198 --> 01:04:52,187
Okay, I'll stop.

1313
01:04:52,299 --> 01:04:56,201
You're causing a scene. You're
making crazy faces now, Ira.

1314
01:04:56,804 --> 01:04:59,295
Open your eyes.
Stop crying.

1315
01:05:00,508 --> 01:05:02,908
You're making noises now? You
look like the Incredible Hulk.

1316
01:05:04,111 --> 01:05:05,976
Jesus, you're spitting on my shrimp,

1317
01:05:06,080 --> 01:05:07,479
you asshole.
I'm sorry.

1318
01:05:08,849 --> 01:05:09,816
God, I'm sorry.

1319
01:05:09,917 --> 01:05:10,906
Come on.
Wipe it off.

1320
01:05:11,719 --> 01:05:13,277
Jesus Christ.

1321
01:05:14,255 --> 01:05:16,587
I'm sorry, I just don't know.

1322
01:05:16,690 --> 01:05:17,987
This is the worst.

1323
01:05:18,092 --> 01:05:20,560
Why didn't I just get hit
by a fucking foul ball?

1324
01:05:21,629 --> 01:05:23,688
You ruined The Palm,
you fucking ass.

1325
01:05:26,333 --> 01:05:29,166
This could have been
the best meal, ever.

1326
01:05:30,337 --> 01:05:31,770
Should I get you
ice chips or something?

1327
01:05:31,872 --> 01:05:33,703
No, I'm good.

1328
01:05:34,475 --> 01:05:35,840
You never had any kids, huh?

1329
01:05:35,943 --> 01:05:37,467
No. No.
We didn't get to that.

1330
01:05:37,578 --> 01:05:39,068
I have three.

1331
01:05:39,180 --> 01:05:40,147
I know.

1332
01:05:40,247 --> 01:05:42,340
Three kids to carry
on the Dick legacy.

1333
01:05:42,449 --> 01:05:46,613
How the hell did you have any kids
with all the penises you've blown?

1334
01:05:46,720 --> 01:05:50,349
I sucked my own dick and
spit it into their vagina.

1335
01:05:51,959 --> 01:05:54,723
I mean, knowing that. Most people
just go through life asleep anyways.

1336
01:05:54,829 --> 01:05:56,922
Some of those people don't even
wake up until they get, you know,

1337
01:05:57,031 --> 01:05:58,396
the Dr. Death call,
you know.

1338
01:05:58,499 --> 01:06:01,297
"This is Dr. Death!
You're going to die. "

1339
01:06:01,402 --> 01:06:03,267
"Don't
be afraid, George.

1340
01:06:03,370 --> 01:06:08,171
"It's just Death calling.
Cheer up, motherfucker!"

1341
01:06:08,776 --> 01:06:10,300
Yeah.
Fuck negativity.

1342
01:06:10,411 --> 01:06:13,005
Fuck it in the ass
with a Chinese monkey!

1343
01:06:13,948 --> 01:06:15,939
I wish I wasn't so fucking
angry with you right now.

1344
01:06:16,717 --> 01:06:18,981
Well, I'm sorry. I'm sorry
I wasn't a good brother.

1345
01:06:19,086 --> 01:06:20,451
You were
a terrible brother.

1346
01:06:20,554 --> 01:06:21,953
You just left us
and you didn't care.

1347
01:06:22,056 --> 01:06:23,956
You didn't give
a shit about us.

1348
01:06:24,058 --> 01:06:25,923
You don't even give a...
You moved to Kansas.

1349
01:06:26,026 --> 01:06:27,960
Am I supposed to visit
you in Kansas? Yes.

1350
01:06:28,062 --> 01:06:30,553
I thought that's why you moved
there, so you didn't get visitors.

1351
01:06:30,664 --> 01:06:31,995
You're so fucking selfish.

1352
01:06:32,099 --> 01:06:33,088
I know.

1353
01:06:33,234 --> 01:06:36,294
You've only seen my son,
like, three times.

1354
01:06:36,403 --> 01:06:39,201
I send him fucking
DVDs all the time.

1355
01:06:39,306 --> 01:06:41,297
He doesn't want your DVDs.

1356
01:06:41,408 --> 01:06:42,966
He wants you to be
a part of his life.

1357
01:06:43,077 --> 01:06:45,068
He wants to be
a part of yours.

1358
01:06:45,179 --> 01:06:47,613
Wow. This has been great.

1359
01:06:47,715 --> 01:06:51,549
I want to call Dad now and
just have more family time.

1360
01:06:51,752 --> 01:06:54,721
What did we ever do to you? I'm not Dad.

1361
01:06:57,091 --> 01:06:59,423
You are right.

1362
01:06:59,526 --> 01:07:03,690
You're very, very nice, and
I'm sorry I don't know your son.

1363
01:07:03,797 --> 01:07:06,766
I'm sorry I don't
know you anymore.

1364
01:07:06,934 --> 01:07:09,061
I'm glad you
don't know me.

1365
01:07:09,169 --> 01:07:10,261
I wish I did.

1366
01:07:11,805 --> 01:07:14,672
You'd be let down,
believe me.

1367
01:07:22,816 --> 01:07:24,613
Oh, man.

1368
01:07:30,557 --> 01:07:32,047
Oh, God.

1369
01:07:35,229 --> 01:07:36,821
Who's that?

1370
01:07:36,931 --> 01:07:38,831
That's the girl
I was gonna marry...

1371
01:07:40,167 --> 01:07:42,362
...but then she
smartened up.

1372
01:07:43,237 --> 01:07:45,671
So, she's 10
and she's six.

1373
01:07:45,773 --> 01:07:48,139
So cute.

1374
01:07:48,242 --> 01:07:50,301
Jeez, she looks like you,
the little one, huh?

1375
01:07:50,411 --> 01:07:51,400
Yeah.

1376
01:07:51,512 --> 01:07:54,345
What's the matter? Your guy
doesn't have any DNA in him?

1377
01:07:54,448 --> 01:07:57,008
That's all Laura.

1378
01:07:57,184 --> 01:07:58,913
They fight a lot,
but they're cute.

1379
01:07:59,420 --> 01:08:03,186
Yeah. Thank you so much for coming here.

1380
01:08:03,757 --> 01:08:05,019
I wanted to come.
I wanted to see you.

1381
01:08:05,125 --> 01:08:06,319
You didn't have
to come here.

1382
01:08:06,427 --> 01:08:09,123
You didn't have to. I know
it's stressful for you.

1383
01:08:09,563 --> 01:08:11,963
I'm just... I'm just... I'm so sorry.

1384
01:08:12,499 --> 01:08:14,797
I'm so sorry about
everything I did.

1385
01:08:15,402 --> 01:08:18,064
You don't have to be sorry.
That was 12 years ago.

1386
01:08:18,172 --> 01:08:20,003
Everything worked out
for the best.

1387
01:08:20,107 --> 01:08:22,268
It's good. Look at your
life. This is great.

1388
01:08:22,676 --> 01:08:28,239
Yes. It's the best life.
I hate it. I hate it all.

1389
01:08:28,349 --> 01:08:29,509
I haven't been...
You don't hate it.

1390
01:08:29,616 --> 01:08:32,517
I'm addicted to it, I guess.
I keep doing it.

1391
01:08:32,953 --> 01:08:35,854
Hello, Wayne. This is Ira.
I'm calling to say

1392
01:08:35,956 --> 01:08:39,119
I don't think today is a good day
for you to come by and see George.

1393
01:08:39,426 --> 01:08:42,452
Maybe tomorrow. So, I'll give you a call
when I know what the schedule looks like.

1394
01:08:42,563 --> 01:08:44,827
Thank you.
I'll talk to you soon.

1395
01:08:46,233 --> 01:08:48,428
You have a family now.
You have a family now.

1396
01:08:48,535 --> 01:08:51,299
I'm so happy. You did the
right thing. You moved on.

1397
01:08:51,405 --> 01:08:53,498
You got a good life.

1398
01:08:53,607 --> 01:08:56,735
And... And I just got
nothing, Laura. I hate that.

1399
01:08:56,844 --> 01:08:59,404
I hate that it could
have been me with you.

1400
01:08:59,513 --> 01:09:00,673
Don't do that, please?

1401
01:09:00,781 --> 01:09:02,408
I'm sorry. I just fucking...

1402
01:09:02,516 --> 01:09:04,882
You... I could have
had those kids with you.

1403
01:09:05,886 --> 01:09:09,515
How could you cheat on me?
I was so hot.

1404
01:09:09,623 --> 01:09:11,147
You were. You were so hot. I don't know.

1405
01:09:11,258 --> 01:09:12,555
I was hot!

1406
01:09:12,659 --> 01:09:15,526
I don't even know what
the fuck I was doing.

1407
01:09:15,629 --> 01:09:20,157
I was just a stupid idiot.
I don't remember anybody else.

1408
01:09:20,267 --> 01:09:21,859
What was wrong with you? I
don't remember anybody else.

1409
01:09:21,969 --> 01:09:23,630
I only remember you.
I don't know.

1410
01:09:23,737 --> 01:09:26,672
I don't even know who they
were, who fucking ruined us.

1411
01:09:26,774 --> 01:09:29,971
They're not in my brain, ever.
It's like it didn't happen.

1412
01:09:30,077 --> 01:09:31,942
The only thing
that happened was us.

1413
01:09:32,046 --> 01:09:34,742
And you ran away
'cause you had to.

1414
01:09:34,848 --> 01:09:36,645
I had to go.

1415
01:09:36,750 --> 01:09:39,981
At the time, I just
couldn't do it anymore.

1416
01:09:40,087 --> 01:09:42,282
Yeah. But you know what I realized?

1417
01:09:42,389 --> 01:09:44,016
I love my husband,

1418
01:09:45,426 --> 01:09:48,088
but it's just not the same.

1419
01:09:49,129 --> 01:09:52,758
And I loved you
so much and...

1420
01:09:54,334 --> 01:09:56,495
I know, I know,
I know, I know.

1421
01:09:56,603 --> 01:09:59,834
I have the same thing.
I have the same thing.

1422
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:02,534
Don't feel bad.
Don't feel bad.

1423
01:10:02,676 --> 01:10:05,804
I love you. I love you.
I always loved you.

1424
01:10:05,913 --> 01:10:09,405
And the crazy thing is
he cheats on me, too.

1425
01:10:09,516 --> 01:10:10,483
I hate...

1426
01:10:10,584 --> 01:10:12,245
He's like an Australian you.

1427
01:10:13,053 --> 01:10:16,955
I fucking hate this guy.
Is he crazy?

1428
01:10:17,057 --> 01:10:20,254
It's just that
you were the one.

1429
01:10:20,360 --> 01:10:25,696
Just you are...
Were... Are the love...

1430
01:10:28,569 --> 01:10:32,403
Love of my life.
And I just love you.

1431
01:10:40,948 --> 01:10:43,314
Yeah, the hug was a mistake, wasn't it?

1432
01:10:46,653 --> 01:10:48,780
You're not sick, are you?

1433
01:10:48,889 --> 01:10:51,949
You're just doing that
to get me down here, huh?

1434
01:10:54,895 --> 01:10:56,419
There are those
hands again.

1435
01:10:56,530 --> 01:10:57,997
My big hands.

1436
01:10:58,132 --> 01:10:59,997
Always made
my penis look small.

1437
01:11:01,201 --> 01:11:03,692
Thank you, hands,
for that complex.

1438
01:11:05,772 --> 01:11:08,206
Yes. Jeez.

1439
01:11:08,308 --> 01:11:14,269
The two of them together, it
was a guaranteed dwarfing. Okay.

1440
01:11:22,022 --> 01:11:23,080
Yeah.

1441
01:11:25,225 --> 01:11:26,852
That was worth it.

1442
01:11:27,294 --> 01:11:29,194
<i>We're into overtime now,
just so you know.</i>

1443
01:11:29,296 --> 01:11:31,161
<i>Jeez,
that came quick.</i>

1444
01:11:31,265 --> 01:11:33,233
<i>I wish that you guys
were really my friends</i>

1445
01:11:33,333 --> 01:11:35,961
<i>and I didn't have to
pay you to jam with me.</i>

1446
01:11:37,471 --> 01:11:40,440
<i>All right,
so let's keep going then.</i>

1447
01:11:53,687 --> 01:11:57,316
<i>All my little
plans and schemes</i>

1448
01:11:59,393 --> 01:12:03,659
<i>Lost like some
forgotten dream</i>

1449
01:12:05,132 --> 01:12:06,326
<i>Seems like all I...</i>

1450
01:12:06,433 --> 01:12:08,060
Diego.
Yes, George?

1451
01:12:08,168 --> 01:12:09,897
The roses
look terrific.

1452
01:12:10,003 --> 01:12:11,595
Thank you. They sure look beautiful.

1453
01:12:11,705 --> 01:12:15,334
Only a guy with a big cock like
you could make roses this beautiful.

1454
01:12:16,777 --> 01:12:20,543
<i>Don't need to be alone</i>

1455
01:12:22,616 --> 01:12:26,382
<i>No need to be alone</i>

1456
01:12:29,423 --> 01:12:34,656
<i>It's real love
It's real</i>

1457
01:12:34,761 --> 01:12:37,127
<i>Yes, it's real love</i>

1458
01:12:37,231 --> 01:12:38,698
You doing stand-up at all?

1459
01:12:38,799 --> 01:12:41,290
This is actually the first time
I've left the house in three years.

1460
01:12:41,401 --> 01:12:42,891
But I will sometimes,
in my house,

1461
01:12:43,036 --> 01:12:45,129
in front of my kids,
I'll do five, six minutes.

1462
01:12:45,239 --> 01:12:47,605
Not good stuff. It's a lot
of "Where you from?" You know.

1463
01:12:47,708 --> 01:12:48,936
But, you know,
all kidding aside,

1464
01:12:49,042 --> 01:12:50,373
I know you're in a terrible situation,

1465
01:12:50,477 --> 01:12:53,071
but even with that, you
look so much better than him.

1466
01:12:57,584 --> 01:13:01,850
<i>The Kingdom of Heaven
is, is in your hands</i>

1467
01:13:02,990 --> 01:13:07,586
<i>I don't expect for you
to awake from your dreams</i>

1468
01:13:07,694 --> 01:13:09,594
We watched your
last movie on video.

1469
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:12,296
A man who is funny
doesn't have to work blue.

1470
01:13:12,432 --> 01:13:14,627
You don't... You don't have
to do trash to be funny.

1471
01:13:14,735 --> 01:13:16,134
I'll tell you who was
a great comedian.

1472
01:13:16,236 --> 01:13:17,601
Please say me. Who?

1473
01:13:17,704 --> 01:13:18,671
Jackie Gleason.

1474
01:13:18,772 --> 01:13:19,898
Yeah, of course.

1475
01:13:20,007 --> 01:13:22,100
You like him 'cause you
look like Art Carney.

1476
01:13:24,978 --> 01:13:28,072
Gleason was terrific.
And you ain't so bad.

1477
01:13:28,181 --> 01:13:30,149
All right. Thank you, Pop. I know.

1478
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:31,877
<i>It's real</i>

1479
01:13:32,019 --> 01:13:35,546
<i>It's real love, oh, yeah</i>

1480
01:13:37,357 --> 01:13:42,090
<i>It's real love, yeah</i>

1481
01:13:43,096 --> 01:13:48,295
<i>It's real love
It's real</i>

1482
01:13:52,506 --> 01:13:55,270
I think I played it
all wrong, Ira.

1483
01:13:56,510 --> 01:13:58,341
I played it all wrong.

1484
01:14:04,284 --> 01:14:07,276
Okay. He's here. We saw each
other. Let me answer it. Mark.

1485
01:14:07,387 --> 01:14:09,548
Stop. Let me answer it. Mark, man.

1486
01:14:10,090 --> 01:14:11,523
Move, bitch!

1487
01:14:11,625 --> 01:14:12,683
Hey, George Simmons. Hey.

1488
01:14:12,793 --> 01:14:14,158
Hey, what's up?

1489
01:14:14,261 --> 01:14:15,751
Happy Thanksgiving.
Hey!

1490
01:14:15,862 --> 01:14:17,227
Mark.
Leo is the name I got.

1491
01:14:17,364 --> 01:14:18,831
<i>How are you?
Yeah, yeah. Yo Teach...!</i>

1492
01:14:18,932 --> 01:14:20,866
That's right!
Yeah, right.

1493
01:14:21,368 --> 01:14:22,801
Oh, boy.

1494
01:14:22,936 --> 01:14:26,235
That movie's the best 'cause
you're a man then you're a baby

1495
01:14:26,340 --> 01:14:28,968
and then you learn to be a
man once you be... You need...

1496
01:14:29,076 --> 01:14:31,340
It takes becoming a baby
to learn how to become a man.

1497
01:14:32,012 --> 01:14:34,742
Yeah. Can we get you
a drink or some food?

1498
01:14:34,848 --> 01:14:37,180
No, no, no. Let me just walk
around and go through your shit.

1499
01:14:39,152 --> 01:14:40,744
Hey, I'm Bo.

1500
01:14:40,854 --> 01:14:42,287
What's up, Bo?
I'm an actor, so...

1501
01:14:42,389 --> 01:14:45,187
Oh, good, good, good,
good, good, good.

1502
01:14:46,993 --> 01:14:48,017
I've seen
your act a lot.

1503
01:14:48,128 --> 01:14:49,288
Really? Where?

1504
01:14:49,396 --> 01:14:53,526
Schmira, he has that... What's that,
the YouTubey thing that, that...

1505
01:14:53,834 --> 01:14:54,823
- The YouTube.
- Yeah.

1506
01:14:54,935 --> 01:14:57,699
George and Daisy are here?
How the hell did that happen?

1507
01:14:57,871 --> 01:15:00,203
I didn't think George would
come, and who invited Daisy?

1508
01:15:00,307 --> 01:15:01,433
I invited her.

1509
01:15:01,541 --> 01:15:03,065
Are you still
sleeping with Daisy?

1510
01:15:03,176 --> 01:15:04,643
No, I'm not
sleeping with Daisy!

1511
01:15:04,778 --> 01:15:08,009
I have a new girlfriend now. I'm
dating the girl who plays Mrs. Pruitt.

1512
01:15:08,115 --> 01:15:09,104
Her name's
Carla something.

1513
01:15:11,333 --> 01:15:13,164
Can I sit next to
George at dinner?

1514
01:15:13,269 --> 01:15:15,203
Sit wherever the hell
you want to sit, man, why?

1515
01:15:15,337 --> 01:15:18,329
I feel like if I can just
make George crack up once,

1516
01:15:18,741 --> 01:15:20,140
it'll do huge things
for me, like...

1517
01:15:20,242 --> 01:15:21,504
What, you wrote
jokes for Thanksgiving?

1518
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:22,736
I didn't write jokes.

1519
01:15:22,845 --> 01:15:24,574
I just wrote down
my funniest anecdotes

1520
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:25,874
and punched them up
here and there.

1521
01:15:26,382 --> 01:15:30,682
Okay, I can't hide in the
kitchen all afternoon. I'm going.

1522
01:15:31,921 --> 01:15:33,684
My man. The Schmira.

1523
01:15:33,789 --> 01:15:35,222
Thanks for coming, man.

1524
01:15:35,324 --> 01:15:37,087
This is the best.
Where's your bedroom?

1525
01:15:37,459 --> 01:15:39,984
Well, get ready for a hike,
'cause you're standing in it.

1526
01:15:40,095 --> 01:15:41,995
No. It's... Yeah, it's pretty lame.

1527
01:15:42,097 --> 01:15:43,428
Did you go to
that Wilco show?

1528
01:15:43,532 --> 01:15:44,521
Yeah, did you?

1529
01:15:44,633 --> 01:15:47,500
No, actually, I didn't.
I scalped the tickets.

1530
01:15:47,970 --> 01:15:48,959
I made 100 bucks
profit, so...

1531
01:15:49,071 --> 01:15:50,060
Oh. So, you
owe me 50.

1532
01:15:53,458 --> 01:15:56,086
Okay, I guess I do.
Rain check, okay?

1533
01:15:56,194 --> 01:15:57,161
Money order.

1534
01:15:57,329 --> 01:15:58,455
Money order? That'll work. Yeah.

1535
01:15:58,564 --> 01:16:00,361
PayPal? Are you on PayPal?
Yeah, PayPal it up.

1536
01:16:00,465 --> 01:16:03,025
Look at that, back and
forth, like a cute couple.

1537
01:16:03,135 --> 01:16:05,535
You're like Marc Anthony and J. Lo.

1538
01:16:05,938 --> 01:16:09,567
You know, we actually had a date,
but then I had sex with that guy,

1539
01:16:09,675 --> 01:16:11,108
so Schmira broke it off.

1540
01:16:11,209 --> 01:16:12,198
You kidding me?

1541
01:16:12,311 --> 01:16:15,474
Don't worry, Ira. You know you're a
better lover than Pete Rose over there.

1542
01:16:15,581 --> 01:16:17,412
Look at him. He's got
the length and the width.

1543
01:16:17,516 --> 01:16:19,245
Imagine that dong of his.

1544
01:16:19,351 --> 01:16:21,512
I saw the tip of it one time.
Even that was too big for me.

1545
01:16:21,620 --> 01:16:23,281
No, it's very normal.
Yeah.

1546
01:16:23,388 --> 01:16:24,616
So, you like big penises?

1547
01:16:24,723 --> 01:16:27,283
Well, you know, I have a
really skinny vagina, so...

1548
01:16:27,392 --> 01:16:29,189
If it's skinny, you should
try feeding it carbs.

1549
01:16:30,996 --> 01:16:32,588
Yeah. All right, well,
jeez, you know what?

1550
01:16:32,698 --> 01:16:34,632
I'm gonna leave
you two alone, huh?

1551
01:16:34,733 --> 01:16:35,700
Yeah, okay.

1552
01:16:35,801 --> 01:16:36,893
I'm falling in love
with the both of you.

1553
01:16:37,002 --> 01:16:38,230
Let the awkwardness begin!

1554
01:16:38,337 --> 01:16:39,326
Love your work.

1555
01:16:39,438 --> 01:16:42,271
Yeah? Thank you
for shopping at Ralphs.

1556
01:16:42,374 --> 01:16:45,400
I'm sorry. I owe you an apology.
It's really weird what I did.

1557
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:49,503
I basically yelled at you for cheating on me
before we had even had a real conversation.

1558
01:16:49,648 --> 01:16:52,674
So, I'm aware of that. I know
that's weird, and I'm sorry.

1559
01:16:52,784 --> 01:16:54,581
Well, it's not as weird
as getting drunk

1560
01:16:54,686 --> 01:16:57,382
<i>and having sex with the guy
from Yo Teach...! So...</i>

1561
01:16:57,723 --> 01:17:00,886
It's okay. When I first moved
here, I blew Mr. Belvedere.

1562
01:17:01,093 --> 01:17:02,856
So, everyone does that.

1563
01:17:02,911 --> 01:17:04,037
He's walking.
George is walking to us.

1564
01:17:04,146 --> 01:17:06,444
Hello, ladies.

1565
01:17:06,548 --> 01:17:10,211
So, Leo? What's the excuse
for not writing me jokes?

1566
01:17:10,886 --> 01:17:12,751
What? You could have made money.

1567
01:17:12,855 --> 01:17:15,483
I told both you guys to write jokes
for me, and you decided not to.

1568
01:17:15,591 --> 01:17:19,186
What, did you have to go
to LensCrafters that day?

1569
01:17:19,295 --> 01:17:21,889
I was just joking.
I like your glasses.

1570
01:17:23,365 --> 01:17:26,493
He wanted both of us to write jokes
for him, and you didn't tell me?

1571
01:17:26,602 --> 01:17:29,298
I apologize. It's not worth,
like, losing your shit over, man.

1572
01:17:29,405 --> 01:17:30,497
What, you don't
think I like money?

1573
01:17:30,606 --> 01:17:31,903
You don't think
I like private jets?

1574
01:17:32,007 --> 01:17:34,771
You don't think I want a cool
job writing for George Simmons?

1575
01:17:34,877 --> 01:17:35,901
I just think
you're doing well.

1576
01:17:36,011 --> 01:17:38,639
You know, you're getting gigs
at the Improv all the time.

1577
01:17:38,747 --> 01:17:40,214
You're gonna have
people writing for you.

1578
01:17:40,316 --> 01:17:43,114
You don't need to be writing
for other people, you know.

1579
01:17:43,218 --> 01:17:44,651
I know, I'm just...
I'm sorry, I just...

1580
01:17:44,753 --> 01:17:47,153
I wanted something for
myself and I just, you know...

1581
01:17:47,256 --> 01:17:49,952
It's just, you know,
fuck you, Ira!

1582
01:17:50,526 --> 01:17:52,016
Just 'cause you go
into faggy-apology mode

1583
01:17:52,127 --> 01:17:54,391
doesn't mean I'm gonna
forgive you right away!

1584
01:17:54,530 --> 01:17:58,591
Fuck you, man. Look, I did the exact same
thing you've been doing this whole time.

1585
01:17:58,701 --> 01:18:00,293
You're being competitive.
You do that all the time.

1586
01:18:00,402 --> 01:18:01,630
I'm doing it now, okay?

1587
01:18:01,737 --> 01:18:03,466
I didn't make it competitive!
Yes, you did.

1588
01:18:03,572 --> 01:18:05,403
Have you ever had
to work for money? No.

1589
01:18:05,507 --> 01:18:07,065
You didn't work
at a coal mine, Ira!

1590
01:18:07,176 --> 01:18:09,940
You worked at a deli!
Stop crying about it!

1591
01:18:10,079 --> 01:18:12,707
I was only supposed to be on that
pull-out couch for six months!

1592
01:18:12,815 --> 01:18:14,806
And we were supposed to
trade! And we never did!

1593
01:18:14,917 --> 01:18:16,350
Yeah, we never did
switch after six months.

1594
01:18:16,452 --> 01:18:17,419
Yeah. Exactly.

1595
01:18:17,519 --> 01:18:19,009
You know why?
'Cause I pay rent, Ira!

1596
01:18:19,121 --> 01:18:20,554
You don't pay rent.
Your parents pay rent!

1597
01:18:20,656 --> 01:18:22,180
Why don't they move in?
It's your fault.

1598
01:18:22,291 --> 01:18:28,059
Hey, hey, hey. Pilgrims, Indians,
can we please stop fighting?

1599
01:18:28,197 --> 01:18:30,961
It's Thanksgiving. We have
guests inside. Please stop.

1600
01:18:31,066 --> 01:18:33,830
I'm not fighting anymore.
I'm done fighting.

1601
01:18:33,936 --> 01:18:35,836
Thank you. You called
Daisy a starfucker?

1602
01:18:35,938 --> 01:18:37,371
<i>Why don't you go cup
George Simmons' balls</i>

1603
01:18:37,473 --> 01:18:40,340
while you talk him to
sleep every night, Ira?

1604
01:18:40,442 --> 01:18:42,034
Leo.

1605
01:18:42,444 --> 01:18:43,411
Sorry.

1606
01:18:43,946 --> 01:18:47,473
I would let you do that, too.
My balls are for everybody.

1607
01:18:49,618 --> 01:18:53,213
Okay. It's starting to feel
like Thanksgiving around here.

1608
01:18:53,956 --> 01:18:55,048
Let's eat some food.

1609
01:19:00,963 --> 01:19:03,659
I can't believe you
screwed Daisy, man.

1610
01:19:05,167 --> 01:19:06,225
What?

1611
01:19:07,202 --> 01:19:10,501
So, does anybody want
to say grace or anything?

1612
01:19:10,606 --> 01:19:12,801
Leo's a good writer, apparently.
Come on, get up there.

1613
01:19:12,908 --> 01:19:14,432
Yeah, Leo.

1614
01:19:14,543 --> 01:19:15,908
Leo!
Do it, Leo.

1615
01:19:16,011 --> 01:19:16,978
I'm okay,
I'm okay.

1616
01:19:17,079 --> 01:19:19,343
All right, let me go.
I'll do it for us.

1617
01:19:19,448 --> 01:19:21,507
Let me get it done.

1618
01:19:21,617 --> 01:19:26,418
Okay, so first let's give thanks
to our families not being here.

1619
01:19:27,589 --> 01:19:30,490
It's always easier, always
easier without the family.

1620
01:19:31,326 --> 01:19:35,194
It's funny, I see you guys and you
are just so much younger than me.

1621
01:19:35,330 --> 01:19:38,561
And I had no idea I was the old
guy until I looked at you guys.

1622
01:19:40,135 --> 01:19:42,296
It was like when I was
growing up, I had a big nose.

1623
01:19:42,404 --> 01:19:45,669
I had no idea until I went to the
Gap and saw a three-way mirror,

1624
01:19:45,774 --> 01:19:48,242
and I was like, "Wow, I
didn't know I had that thing. "

1625
01:19:49,445 --> 01:19:52,903
Yeah. No, it's a...
It's good to be young.

1626
01:19:53,015 --> 01:19:55,745
It kind of sucks being old,
so just enjoy this.

1627
01:19:55,851 --> 01:19:59,844
Enjoy time. Time slips
away, I promise you.

1628
01:19:59,955 --> 01:20:03,413
I had a dinner
like this 20 years ago

1629
01:20:03,559 --> 01:20:07,620
with guys that we just, like,
lost touch with each other.

1630
01:20:07,729 --> 01:20:10,926
I never talk to them anymore.
Some of them are dead.

1631
01:20:11,767 --> 01:20:16,136
So, yeah, you don't...
Things slip away.

1632
01:20:17,673 --> 01:20:20,699
If you love somebody,
don't let them slip away.

1633
01:20:21,910 --> 01:20:23,775
I swear to you,

1634
01:20:23,879 --> 01:20:26,404
this will be your most
memorable Thanksgiving,

1635
01:20:26,548 --> 01:20:29,210
the one that you'll want the rest
of your life, the one that you say,

1636
01:20:29,318 --> 01:20:31,946
"Man, it was never
as good as that night. "

1637
01:20:32,054 --> 01:20:36,457
So, let this night be great.
Enjoy the taste of Leo's balls.

1638
01:20:38,260 --> 01:20:39,284
<i>Rock 'n ' roll!</i>

1639
01:20:40,596 --> 01:20:44,225
Jesus, every time I'm near you
I feel like fucking Danny DeVito.

1640
01:20:44,333 --> 01:20:47,063
Everybody feels like Danny DeVito
when, you know, they walk by me.

1641
01:20:47,169 --> 01:20:48,466
Yeah. You're a giant.

1642
01:20:49,638 --> 01:20:51,265
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Well, yeah.

1643
01:20:51,907 --> 01:20:52,999
Um...

1644
01:20:53,575 --> 01:20:54,542
I don't want
to get your hopes up.

1645
01:20:54,643 --> 01:20:55,632
Mmm-hmm.

1646
01:20:55,744 --> 01:20:59,236
We put you on this experimental
medication without much optimism.

1647
01:20:59,348 --> 01:21:03,546
About 8% of all the people that we put
on this medication get positive results.

1648
01:21:03,652 --> 01:21:04,641
Mmm-hmm.

1649
01:21:04,753 --> 01:21:08,086
You actually
belong to these 8%.

1650
01:21:08,190 --> 01:21:09,657
I looked through
your blood work,

1651
01:21:09,758 --> 01:21:12,693
and I couldn't find
any traces of the disease.

1652
01:21:13,695 --> 01:21:16,027
I don't want
to speak too soon,

1653
01:21:16,131 --> 01:21:17,655
but we may have
beaten this thing.

1654
01:21:20,719 --> 01:21:23,187
Are you fucking with me
'cause I fucked with you?

1655
01:21:23,288 --> 01:21:26,587
So, that's the good news, Mr. Bond.

1656
01:21:29,027 --> 01:21:31,689
So, this is, this is...
This is good news.

1657
01:21:32,864 --> 01:21:34,832
Like my accent now?

1658
01:21:34,933 --> 01:21:36,696
Now I like
your accent, yeah.

1659
01:21:37,369 --> 01:21:40,167
I was excited all morning
to tell you this news.

1660
01:21:40,672 --> 01:21:43,038
So, what happens now? What
do I... What do I do now?

1661
01:21:43,141 --> 01:21:46,872
Maybe you can make another funny
movie that I could laugh about.

1662
01:21:47,012 --> 01:21:52,279
Yeah. Wow. I wasn't
expecting this to really work.

1663
01:21:52,384 --> 01:21:53,715
I was getting
used to being sick.

1664
01:21:53,818 --> 01:21:56,719
I was actually thinking
I was pretty good at that.

1665
01:21:56,821 --> 01:21:58,755
Get back to your life.

1666
01:22:06,965 --> 01:22:09,331
<i>Hey, this is Ira. I'm
not in. Leave a message.</i>

1667
01:22:10,569 --> 01:22:16,235
Ira, I have a secret to tell
you. It will make you happy.

1668
01:22:35,226 --> 01:22:37,217
Hi. Bonita?

1669
01:22:37,329 --> 01:22:38,296
George.

1670
01:22:41,633 --> 01:22:44,796
I was sick, you know that. And
I just went to the doctor's.

1671
01:22:44,903 --> 01:22:47,098
He said I'm
not sick anymore.

1672
01:22:47,205 --> 01:22:49,105
Oh, congratulations.

1673
01:22:52,444 --> 01:22:55,902
I found the pants you're looking
for. They are in the closet.

1674
01:22:58,183 --> 01:22:59,775
Thank you.

1675
01:23:00,885 --> 01:23:01,874
Bye, George.

1676
01:23:03,688 --> 01:23:05,986
George! Is it true?

1677
01:23:06,825 --> 01:23:08,122
It's true.
Yes!

1678
01:23:08,226 --> 01:23:09,853
It's all right. All
right, go ahead. Yeah!

1679
01:23:09,961 --> 01:23:10,928
All right.

1680
01:23:11,029 --> 01:23:13,998
Oh, God! Yeah!

1681
01:23:14,099 --> 01:23:15,191
All right, baby.

1682
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:18,531
All right, all right.
Now what the fuck do we do?

1683
01:23:20,705 --> 01:23:22,798
Hey, congratulations, George.
That's awesome, man.

1684
01:23:22,907 --> 01:23:24,568
Thank you.
You got cured of AIDS.

1685
01:23:24,709 --> 01:23:25,937
I didn't
have AIDS.

1686
01:23:26,044 --> 01:23:27,136
Hey, let me get
you a cocktail.

1687
01:23:27,245 --> 01:23:28,769
Hey, not an AIDS cocktail. A regular.

1688
01:23:28,880 --> 01:23:30,370
No, I don't want a drink. I'm good.

1689
01:23:30,482 --> 01:23:33,076
I'm gonna get one
of them ribbons.

1690
01:23:33,685 --> 01:23:34,982
You're alive?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1691
01:23:35,086 --> 01:23:38,180
Unbelievable!
This guy. This guy, man.

1692
01:23:38,289 --> 01:23:42,225
You got the women, you got the
fame, and you can't fucking die!

1693
01:23:42,327 --> 01:23:44,522
Did you suck the devil's
dick? What is it, man?

1694
01:23:44,629 --> 01:23:45,687
I wanna know the secret.

1695
01:23:45,797 --> 01:23:47,492
I actually told a bunch
of people we did have sex,

1696
01:23:47,599 --> 01:23:48,998
so if you could
go along with that.

1697
01:23:49,100 --> 01:23:50,260
You did?
Yes.

1698
01:23:50,368 --> 01:23:54,600
Everybody wants to fuck me,
but it's better that I don't

1699
01:23:54,706 --> 01:23:56,071
because you don't want...

1700
01:23:56,174 --> 01:23:58,335
The mystery is definitely
more flattering...

1701
01:23:58,443 --> 01:23:59,410
Yeah?

1702
01:23:59,511 --> 01:24:02,241
...and the reality
is so, like, flobbety.

1703
01:24:02,347 --> 01:24:04,042
Like not the word, but...
Floppety? Yeah, lippety.

1704
01:24:04,449 --> 01:24:06,383
Yeah, I look like this.
Like a sandwich.

1705
01:24:06,484 --> 01:24:08,247
Like a... There's,
like, meat coming.

1706
01:24:09,454 --> 01:24:11,513
That would have been...
I could get...

1707
01:24:11,623 --> 01:24:13,284
Look at that!

1708
01:24:13,925 --> 01:24:15,620
"Yippee-ki-yay,
motherfucker!"

1709
01:24:15,727 --> 01:24:18,389
Shit! Shit! I didn't know you
had energy like that. Jesus...

1710
01:24:20,166 --> 01:24:22,657
How did he... Like, how
did he know he had it?

1711
01:24:23,402 --> 01:24:27,532
He was saying... He said that he was, like,
dizzy and tired and he went to the doctor,

1712
01:24:27,640 --> 01:24:30,609
and then he just got...
It was in his blood work.

1713
01:24:30,710 --> 01:24:33,042
That sucks 'cause
I get dizzy and tired.

1714
01:24:33,145 --> 01:24:34,112
Really?

1715
01:24:35,014 --> 01:24:37,574
Anybody... Anybody gets sick,
I think I'm going to get it.

1716
01:24:37,683 --> 01:24:39,776
Now, is it contagious?
It's not contagious?

1717
01:24:39,885 --> 01:24:40,874
No.
Can you get it, like...

1718
01:24:40,986 --> 01:24:44,319
I hope not. I don't think so. I've
been around him a lot. I feel...

1719
01:24:44,423 --> 01:24:45,856
I feel...
I hope not, too, because

1720
01:24:45,958 --> 01:24:48,518
when you were talking, a little
bit of your spit hit my lip, so...

1721
01:24:48,627 --> 01:24:49,992
It did? Yeah. Not that you got it,

1722
01:24:50,096 --> 01:24:52,030
but he spits on your lip, you
spit on mine, next thing you know

1723
01:24:52,131 --> 01:24:54,497
I'm dead and my wife's
fucking George Lopez.

1724
01:24:54,867 --> 01:24:56,425
But I think the best thing
for you would be, you know...

1725
01:24:56,535 --> 01:24:58,196
The best cure,
besides the real cure,

1726
01:24:58,304 --> 01:25:02,035
is to get back to work
and do what you do.

1727
01:25:02,441 --> 01:25:04,409
There are stacks of offers
on my desk for you.

1728
01:25:04,510 --> 01:25:07,411
I mean, you can't swing a dead cat
without hitting an offer for you.

1729
01:25:07,513 --> 01:25:09,003
Oh, good.
Yeah, you ready for this?

1730
01:25:09,115 --> 01:25:11,140
Paul Rudd wants to do
a bromance with you.

1731
01:25:11,250 --> 01:25:14,310
I think I might... I just might
even not work for a little while.

1732
01:25:14,420 --> 01:25:15,910
I was thinking maybe just,
like, taking time off,

1733
01:25:16,021 --> 01:25:19,684
try to get myself in a
relationship with, like,

1734
01:25:19,792 --> 01:25:21,555
another human being,
a normal one.

1735
01:25:21,660 --> 01:25:22,718
Just see if I can
handle that.

1736
01:25:22,828 --> 01:25:24,125
Funny you should say that.
I've... 'Cause I invited someone.

1737
01:25:25,848 --> 01:25:27,941
Brought... Invited this woman here
today that I think you'd really like.

1738
01:25:28,049 --> 01:25:29,038
I think you'd really
hit it off with her.

1739
01:25:29,150 --> 01:25:31,584
She's... She's great.
She's something new for you.

1740
01:25:31,686 --> 01:25:33,881
A real person.
She's not a waitress.

1741
01:25:33,989 --> 01:25:35,183
She's not an actress.

1742
01:25:35,290 --> 01:25:36,257
All right, thanks.

1743
01:25:36,758 --> 01:25:40,626
You know, the Internet dating thing
actually... Actually kind of works.

1744
01:25:41,029 --> 01:25:41,996
That's good.

1745
01:25:42,097 --> 01:25:43,496
I've actually been
on a couple of JDates.

1746
01:25:43,598 --> 01:25:44,565
No way. What's that?

1747
01:25:44,666 --> 01:25:45,997
Yeah... What's a JDate?

1748
01:25:46,101 --> 01:25:48,092
What, is that an Internet
thing I should know about?

1749
01:25:48,203 --> 01:25:49,761
I'm not...
I don't do that shit.

1750
01:25:49,871 --> 01:25:52,965
It's a website where Jewish
people can find each other.

1751
01:25:53,074 --> 01:25:55,304
Really? A whole list
of Jewish people? Yeah.

1752
01:25:55,410 --> 01:25:58,607
I didn't think Jewish people
liked to be on lists.

1753
01:26:00,181 --> 01:26:02,149
Because of the Holocaust.

1754
01:26:03,852 --> 01:26:05,410
Wow.

1755
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:06,782
How's this going,
by the way?

1756
01:26:08,089 --> 01:26:10,182
It's been great to meet you.

1757
01:26:11,826 --> 01:26:14,624
You know what?
I think you fucked up.

1758
01:26:16,231 --> 01:26:17,198
How's that?

1759
01:26:17,298 --> 01:26:19,095
I think you fucked up.
I think...

1760
01:26:20,335 --> 01:26:22,166
I don't think you should
have took that medicine.

1761
01:26:22,270 --> 01:26:23,464
Why not?

1762
01:26:24,839 --> 01:26:27,808
I don't know. Personally, I think
you should have just let yourself die.

1763
01:26:27,942 --> 01:26:29,637
Honestly, man, what are...
What are you gonna do now?

1764
01:26:29,744 --> 01:26:31,837
Make another
bullshit movie?

1765
01:26:31,946 --> 01:26:34,141
Fuck another chick
who doesn't like you?

1766
01:26:34,249 --> 01:26:36,342
You know? That was
your way out right there.

1767
01:26:36,451 --> 01:26:37,975
Hmm.
Now you're fucking stuck.

1768
01:26:38,086 --> 01:26:39,075
Yeah.

1769
01:26:39,187 --> 01:26:40,848
You're stuck just like me.

1770
01:26:40,955 --> 01:26:42,422
Can't go to fucking
Chuck E. Cheese.

1771
01:26:42,524 --> 01:26:45,049
I can't go to Target,
I can't go to Best Buy.

1772
01:26:45,193 --> 01:26:46,888
I can't go to fucking
Wal-Mart, Kmart.

1773
01:26:46,995 --> 01:26:48,656
You fucking name it,
I can't go there.

1774
01:26:48,797 --> 01:26:49,786
Yeah, that's true.

1775
01:26:49,898 --> 01:26:52,059
Everyone in this fucking room
is either staring at us,

1776
01:26:52,167 --> 01:26:53,657
wanting to take a
fucking picture. Mmm-hmm.

1777
01:26:54,269 --> 01:26:55,531
Yeah. Got it.

1778
01:26:55,637 --> 01:26:56,626
E- mail that to me.

1779
01:26:56,738 --> 01:26:58,831
I will. That's awesome. Yeah.

1780
01:26:58,940 --> 01:27:02,808
Who the fuck is that guy right
there? That fucking guy right there.

1781
01:27:03,011 --> 01:27:05,172
What? Ray Romano's
bothering you?

1782
01:27:05,280 --> 01:27:06,542
Who? Ray, Ray who?

1783
01:27:06,648 --> 01:27:09,116
<i>Ray Romano, the guy from
Everybody Loves Raymond.</i>

1784
01:27:09,217 --> 01:27:10,309
I don't give a fuck
what show he's on.

1785
01:27:10,418 --> 01:27:12,249
I'll fuck this
motherfucker up, man!

1786
01:27:12,353 --> 01:27:14,480
Hey.
Hey, Ray!

1787
01:27:14,589 --> 01:27:15,556
Hello, Marshall.

1788
01:27:15,657 --> 01:27:17,056
Fucking problem
here, buddy?

1789
01:27:17,992 --> 01:27:21,018
Would you like to fuck me?
Is that what this is?

1790
01:27:21,129 --> 01:27:22,187
I don't get it, man.
What's going on?

1791
01:27:22,297 --> 01:27:25,391
Would you like me to fucking
bend over for you right now?

1792
01:27:25,500 --> 01:27:27,092
Say no.
No, man.

1793
01:27:28,703 --> 01:27:30,193
I just gotta always
be on my toes, man.

1794
01:27:30,305 --> 01:27:31,272
You know?

1795
01:27:31,372 --> 01:27:32,737
I see that,
but not with Ray Romano.

1796
01:27:32,841 --> 01:27:34,468
This is why I don't
go out of the house.

1797
01:27:34,576 --> 01:27:36,840
I thought everybody loved you.

1798
01:27:38,279 --> 01:27:42,978
So, now that you got this, this second
chance, man, like, what do you want?

1799
01:27:43,084 --> 01:27:44,915
I kind of don't
want anything.

1800
01:27:46,087 --> 01:27:47,918
So, then what
are we celebrating?

1801
01:28:00,435 --> 01:28:01,402
Clarke?

1802
01:28:01,503 --> 01:28:02,470
<i>Yes, it's Clarke.</i>

1803
01:28:02,570 --> 01:28:06,006
It's Clarke and I... I'm
calling to check on you, matey.

1804
01:28:07,208 --> 01:28:08,402
Yeah.

1805
01:28:08,510 --> 01:28:13,379
<i>I'm back from the sea. It's
fun to play with my didjeridu!</i>

1806
01:28:13,481 --> 01:28:15,847
You sound a little bit
like a pirate.

1807
01:28:15,950 --> 01:28:19,386
<i>Do I sound Australian? Is
this what Clarke sounds like?</i>

1808
01:28:19,521 --> 01:28:21,955
That's a terrible
Australian accent.

1809
01:28:22,056 --> 01:28:23,045
What are you doing, Laura?

1810
01:28:23,158 --> 01:28:24,625
<i>Am I bothering you? Is he
there? No, no, no, no, no.</i>

1811
01:28:24,726 --> 01:28:26,455
Am I supposed to hang up?
What's going on?

1812
01:28:26,661 --> 01:28:28,856
<i>Clarke's away
for business in China.</i>

1813
01:28:28,963 --> 01:28:31,625
Ah! Sent him out
for egg rolls again?

1814
01:28:31,733 --> 01:28:34,201
Are you guys all right?
What's going on?

1815
01:28:34,602 --> 01:28:36,502
Mable has her
recital tomorrow.

1816
01:28:36,604 --> 01:28:38,003
<i>She's singing
Memory from Cats.</i>

1817
01:28:38,106 --> 01:28:39,095
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

1818
01:28:39,207 --> 01:28:40,401
<i>You know
that song, Memory?</i>

1819
01:28:40,508 --> 01:28:42,373
Yeah. I wish I could
be there to see that.

1820
01:28:42,477 --> 01:28:43,444
<i>You can come.</i>

1821
01:28:43,545 --> 01:28:45,513
I can come?
All right, I'm coming.

1822
01:28:45,613 --> 01:28:46,739
<i>Your daughter will be
all right with that?</i>

1823
01:28:46,848 --> 01:28:48,975
<i>That I'm sitting right next
to you holding you tight?</i>

1824
01:28:49,083 --> 01:28:51,677
Stop. How are you feeling?

1825
01:28:51,786 --> 01:28:53,651
I'm doing good. I'm doing...

1826
01:28:53,755 --> 01:28:55,586
It is what it is. I...

1827
01:28:55,690 --> 01:28:57,214
<i>So, what happened
with your tests?</i>

1828
01:28:57,859 --> 01:29:00,020
Laura, let's not
talk about all that.

1829
01:29:00,128 --> 01:29:01,254
<i>What did
the doctor say?</i>

1830
01:29:01,863 --> 01:29:05,993
<i>The Swedish Nazi?
He never has good news.</i>

1831
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:08,796
<i>It is what it is. I don't
want to talk about it.</i>

1832
01:29:09,838 --> 01:29:12,204
Come on,
let's just talk about you.

1833
01:29:12,307 --> 01:29:14,707
<i>What are you doing, Laura?</i>

1834
01:29:14,809 --> 01:29:16,504
Do you want me
to talk you to sleep?

1835
01:29:16,978 --> 01:29:18,946
<i>Oh, my God.
You remember.</i>

1836
01:29:20,582 --> 01:29:21,844
<i>You want me
to do that for you?</i>

1837
01:29:21,950 --> 01:29:23,440
You will talk to me
while I try to go to sleep?

1838
01:29:23,551 --> 01:29:26,418
I'll put you on speakerphone. That
will be the best night of my life.

1839
01:29:26,521 --> 01:29:29,786
Let's not go to sleep yet,
though, please. Just talk to Laura.

1840
01:29:31,292 --> 01:29:32,316
<i>Hello?</i>

1841
01:29:32,427 --> 01:29:33,621
Hi, Ira.

1842
01:29:33,728 --> 01:29:34,717
<i>Hey, how's
it going?</i>

1843
01:29:35,296 --> 01:29:36,923
Ira, you're
my best friend.

1844
01:29:37,031 --> 01:29:38,589
<i>I like you, too.</i>

1845
01:29:38,733 --> 01:29:40,496
You're my best friend.

1846
01:29:40,602 --> 01:29:42,331
You sound like you're
in a good mood, man.

1847
01:29:42,437 --> 01:29:44,905
I'm in a great mood because
we're setting sail today.

1848
01:29:45,006 --> 01:29:46,496
We're gonna do
a gig together!

1849
01:29:46,608 --> 01:29:47,973
Ira and Georgie,
finally on the road!

1850
01:29:49,660 --> 01:29:53,221
Oh, we're setting sail, are
we? Where, where are we going?

1851
01:29:53,330 --> 01:29:57,733
<i>We're going to the Port of San
Francisco. We set sail on the morrow.</i>

1852
01:29:57,835 --> 01:29:59,200
How much time
am I supposed to do?

1853
01:29:59,303 --> 01:30:03,763
Oh, they've booked you to do a minute
for every inch of cock you have.

1854
01:30:03,874 --> 01:30:06,434
<i>You'll be doing two and
a half to four minutes,</i>

1855
01:30:06,543 --> 01:30:09,103
<i>depending on your mood,
little Ira.</i>

1856
01:30:09,580 --> 01:30:14,244
<i>I was invited to a... Or I
was able to go to a fundraiser</i>

1857
01:30:14,351 --> 01:30:16,842
<i>for Barack Obama, when he
was running for president.</i>

1858
01:30:17,488 --> 01:30:21,857
<i>And you could walk
right up to him and I did.</i>

1859
01:30:21,959 --> 01:30:25,861
<i>And I prepared a smart
question and I was like,</i>

1860
01:30:25,963 --> 01:30:32,527
<i>"Senator Obama, when you were a student
in Boston, did you encounter any racism?"</i>

1861
01:30:32,636 --> 01:30:38,597
<i>And he said something really,
really interesting. He said...</i>

1862
01:30:39,743 --> 01:30:41,836
<i>He said, "I'm Kanye West. "</i>

1863
01:30:47,651 --> 01:30:49,710
George, you have a visitor.

1864
01:30:49,820 --> 01:30:50,946
Oh.

1865
01:30:51,722 --> 01:30:53,622
Hi.
Whoa!

1866
01:30:53,724 --> 01:30:54,748
Hello.
Wow.

1867
01:30:54,858 --> 01:30:56,223
Hey, hi!
Hey!

1868
01:30:56,360 --> 01:30:57,725
All right.
How are you?

1869
01:30:57,828 --> 01:30:58,795
I'm good.

1870
01:30:58,896 --> 01:31:00,727
I'm so psyched
you came.

1871
01:31:00,831 --> 01:31:02,731
Wow, you look amazing!
Thank you.

1872
01:31:02,833 --> 01:31:04,596
Beautiful.
I think I overdressed.

1873
01:31:04,701 --> 01:31:05,929
No way.
You look incredible.

1874
01:31:06,036 --> 01:31:07,025
I just...

1875
01:31:07,137 --> 01:31:08,627
Where... Where is he?
Where is the Clarke?

1876
01:31:10,358 --> 01:31:13,987
The Clarke? He's out of town. I was
gonna bring my friend Betsy with me,

1877
01:31:14,094 --> 01:31:16,187
but her son started
throwing up, so...

1878
01:31:16,296 --> 01:31:19,026
<i>The husband's out of town,
baby's vomiting. Rock 'n ' roll.</i>

1879
01:31:19,133 --> 01:31:22,591
I like it. Yeah. Yeah.

1880
01:31:22,703 --> 01:31:24,034
Anyway, I don't
want to keep you

1881
01:31:24,138 --> 01:31:25,162
or get in the way.

1882
01:31:25,272 --> 01:31:26,796
No, don't run away.
Come on, Ira, say hello.

1883
01:31:26,907 --> 01:31:27,874
Hey, Ira.

1884
01:31:27,975 --> 01:31:28,999
Hey, how's it going?

1885
01:31:29,109 --> 01:31:31,703
So, I'll let you go.
I just wanted to say hi.

1886
01:31:31,812 --> 01:31:33,609
No cursing.
Don't curse so much.

1887
01:31:33,714 --> 01:31:35,807
Okay, all right! Nothing
dirty. I don't know how.

1888
01:31:35,916 --> 01:31:38,942
You just cut my set in half, but
that's fine. All right, see you, kid.

1889
01:31:39,052 --> 01:31:40,019
Okay, good luck.

1890
01:31:40,120 --> 01:31:41,747
Thanks for coming.

1891
01:31:43,824 --> 01:31:47,089
You gotta tell her I'm better
at intermission, all right?

1892
01:31:47,194 --> 01:31:48,684
You haven't told her
that you're better?

1893
01:31:48,795 --> 01:31:50,490
No, I'm not good
at stuff like that.

1894
01:31:50,597 --> 01:31:52,690
Just... She'll be cool
with it. She'll be...

1895
01:31:52,799 --> 01:31:55,927
You're giving her good
news, she'll be happy.

1896
01:31:56,036 --> 01:31:57,333
We're gonna go by her
house tomorrow, too.

1897
01:31:58,539 --> 01:32:00,564
Yeah, we're just visiting her.
I just want to say hi,

1898
01:32:00,674 --> 01:32:02,608
see how she's doing, where
she lives, that kind of thing.

1899
01:32:02,910 --> 01:32:05,378
Why did you guys break up
in the first place?

1900
01:32:06,113 --> 01:32:07,478
I cheated on her.

1901
01:32:07,581 --> 01:32:09,412
Why would you
cheat on her?

1902
01:32:09,516 --> 01:32:12,679
It's easy not to cheat when no one
wants to fuck you, you judgmental prick.

1903
01:32:12,786 --> 01:32:13,810
Okay.

1904
01:32:15,406 --> 01:32:20,469
<i>I have a theory that Tom Cruise,
David Beckham and Will Smith</i>

1905
01:32:20,578 --> 01:32:22,569
<i>have mooshed the heads
of their penises together.</i>

1906
01:32:24,882 --> 01:32:26,110
<i>I think that
this has happened.</i>

1907
01:32:26,217 --> 01:32:27,844
<i>I don't think it happened in a gay way.</i>

1908
01:32:27,952 --> 01:32:29,283
<i>I think it just happened
out of boredom.</i>

1909
01:32:29,386 --> 01:32:31,354
<i>I think just
rich-dude boredom.</i>

1910
01:32:31,455 --> 01:32:34,891
<i>Just like, "What have we not
done, guys? We've done everything!"</i>

1911
01:32:35,025 --> 01:32:37,493
<i>"I'll tell you one
thing we haven't done. "</i>

1912
01:32:37,595 --> 01:32:41,031
<i>And I bet when it happened, it was
an epic occurrence. It was huge.</i>

1913
01:32:41,165 --> 01:32:42,257
<i>I think of it all the time.</i>

1914
01:32:42,366 --> 01:32:44,664
<i>I think first, you know, David
and Tom touched dick heads.</i>

1915
01:32:44,768 --> 01:32:48,932
<i>And it was easy, just zoonk. Because
there was a magnetic field to it.</i>

1916
01:32:49,139 --> 01:32:50,902
<i>And then Will Smith started
approaching with his dick</i>

1917
01:32:51,008 --> 01:32:52,873
<i>and, like, wind started
blowing in his face,</i>

1918
01:32:52,977 --> 01:32:57,744
<i>and paper started flying everywhere
and he just couldn't do it.</i>

1919
01:32:57,848 --> 01:32:59,440
<i>And they're like, "Come
on, Will, get it in there!"</i>

1920
01:32:59,550 --> 01:33:00,915
<i>"I can't do it!"</i>

1921
01:33:01,018 --> 01:33:01,985
<i>Beckham yells,</i>

1922
01:33:02,086 --> 01:33:05,112
<i>"Don't cross the streams!
It's like Ghost Busters!"</i>

1923
01:33:05,389 --> 01:33:07,721
<i>And then he does it and
Flash by Queen starts playing.</i>

1924
01:33:07,825 --> 01:33:09,190
<i>It's just, Flash! Ahhh!</i>

1925
01:33:09,593 --> 01:33:14,087
<i>Light shoots into the sky! That's
how stars are born, I think.</i>

1926
01:33:15,132 --> 01:33:18,829
<i>Anyway, I'm Ira Wright. Have a good
night. Thank you, all, very much.</i>

1927
01:33:25,843 --> 01:33:27,140
Hey.
How's it going?

1928
01:33:27,244 --> 01:33:28,506
That was so good!

1929
01:33:29,246 --> 01:33:30,873
You seem so surprised.

1930
01:33:30,981 --> 01:33:32,141
Well, you looked
so nervous before.

1931
01:33:32,249 --> 01:33:33,375
I was, actually.

1932
01:33:33,484 --> 01:33:34,508
That was good.
That was really good.

1933
01:33:34,618 --> 01:33:36,085
Thank you.
I appreciate that.

1934
01:33:36,186 --> 01:33:39,587
And the ball cleavage thing,
that was hilarious.

1935
01:33:39,723 --> 01:33:43,159
Classic stuff. Thank you.
Glad you're having fun.

1936
01:33:45,629 --> 01:33:47,597
George says that he's known
you for a while. How did...

1937
01:33:47,698 --> 01:33:49,529
Yeah. How did you guys first hook up?

1938
01:33:49,633 --> 01:33:52,101
I was the hat-check girl at
the Improv and I was an actress.

1939
01:33:52,436 --> 01:33:53,562
So, you kind of...
Yeah, yeah.

1940
01:33:53,671 --> 01:33:56,765
That's good. What, were you
in anything I might've seen?

1941
01:33:56,874 --> 01:34:01,607
<i>I did those, like,
Melrose Place and 90210.</i>

1942
01:34:01,712 --> 01:34:02,679
Awesome.

1943
01:34:02,780 --> 01:34:03,838
I always
played the bitch.

1944
01:34:03,947 --> 01:34:05,107
I wasn't that
good, actually.

1945
01:34:05,215 --> 01:34:06,512
No, you must be
a great actress,

1946
01:34:06,617 --> 01:34:08,175
'cause you're not
at all bitchy, so...

1947
01:34:09,453 --> 01:34:10,511
Thanks, Ira.

1948
01:34:10,621 --> 01:34:15,422
Okay, look, I'm not... Honestly,
I'm not supposed to be telling you

1949
01:34:15,526 --> 01:34:18,222
what I'm about to tell you because
George... He doesn't want to jinx it.

1950
01:34:18,329 --> 01:34:22,629
It's not 100%, but the last
time that he went to the doctor,

1951
01:34:22,733 --> 01:34:26,726
they couldn't find any trace of the
disease in his blood work anymore,

1952
01:34:26,837 --> 01:34:29,397
so it seems like
he might be better.

1953
01:34:29,506 --> 01:34:30,495
What are you
talking about?

1954
01:34:30,607 --> 01:34:31,835
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

1955
01:34:31,942 --> 01:34:33,273
We think he might be okay.

1956
01:34:33,377 --> 01:34:35,470
<i>...George Simmons!</i>

1957
01:34:46,724 --> 01:34:48,021
<i>Thank you.</i>

1958
01:34:48,125 --> 01:34:51,720
<i>Thank you.
Thank you. Yeah.</i>

1959
01:34:53,864 --> 01:34:55,695
<i>It's great to be here.</i>

1960
01:34:57,000 --> 01:34:59,833
<i>It's great.
It's great to be alive!</i>

1961
01:35:01,438 --> 01:35:04,373
<i>Yeah, man. Thank you. Right on. Okay.</i>

1962
01:35:04,475 --> 01:35:05,567
Thank you
for coming, George!

1963
01:35:05,676 --> 01:35:06,700
<i>Thank you. All right.</i>

1964
01:35:06,810 --> 01:35:09,472
<i>That's very nice.
Man, oh, man.</i>

1965
01:35:10,214 --> 01:35:13,513
<i>Any other 40-year-olds out
there tonight? In their 40s?</i>

1966
01:35:13,617 --> 01:35:14,879
<i>It's funny.
In your 20s you're like,</i>

1967
01:35:14,985 --> 01:35:17,078
<i>"Fuck you, man.
Fuck that shit.</i>

1968
01:35:17,187 --> 01:35:19,621
<i>"Fuck my parents. I don't
need none of that shit. "</i>

1969
01:35:19,723 --> 01:35:21,418
<i>In your 30s you're like,
"Fuck the President.</i>

1970
01:35:21,525 --> 01:35:23,857
<i>"Fuck that guy,
that fucking asshole. "</i>

1971
01:35:23,961 --> 01:35:26,191
<i>In your 40s you're like,
"I'm hungry.</i>

1972
01:35:27,531 --> 01:35:29,522
<i>"What do we have
in the fridge?"</i>

1973
01:35:32,603 --> 01:35:36,767
<i>So, yeah, I'm fucking famous
and rich, and it's crazy.</i>

1974
01:35:37,775 --> 01:35:40,039
<i>It's... You know why?
'Cause I hate rich people.</i>

1975
01:35:40,144 --> 01:35:41,668
<i>Fucking I'm rich
and I hate rich people.</i>

1976
01:35:41,779 --> 01:35:43,940
<i>I hate everything
I fucking do now.</i>

1977
01:35:44,047 --> 01:35:45,139
<i>I go to Hawaii, I'm like,</i>

1978
01:35:45,249 --> 01:35:49,549
<i>"You fucking snotty
cocksucker, going to Hawaii. "</i>

1979
01:35:50,154 --> 01:35:54,090
<i>Buy a new car, "La-di-da,
look who's got a new car. "</i>

1980
01:35:54,758 --> 01:35:58,159
<i>You know, I thought about giving
all my money, just giving it away,</i>

1981
01:35:58,262 --> 01:36:01,527
<i>but then I was like,
"What a rich-guy thing to do.</i>

1982
01:36:03,767 --> 01:36:05,394
<i>"Mr. Charitable. "</i>

1983
01:36:06,804 --> 01:36:09,204
Well, why didn't you
tell me? I was just here.

1984
01:36:09,306 --> 01:36:11,900
Laura, if I told you, you might not
have talked to me anymore, so I...

1985
01:36:12,009 --> 01:36:13,738
What are you talking about?
That's ridiculous.

1986
01:36:13,844 --> 01:36:15,709
I knew you forgave me
because I was sick

1987
01:36:15,813 --> 01:36:17,576
and there was no other way
you would forgive me.

1988
01:36:17,681 --> 01:36:18,978
I know,
but it's different now.

1989
01:36:19,082 --> 01:36:21,346
We've been talking...
What are you... No!

1990
01:36:21,452 --> 01:36:22,419
Really?

1991
01:36:22,519 --> 01:36:24,646
This is... So, what are
you... So, did the...

1992
01:36:25,055 --> 01:36:26,989
The doctor said I'm good.
I'm better for now.

1993
01:36:27,090 --> 01:36:28,387
I don't know what
the hell's gonna happen,

1994
01:36:28,492 --> 01:36:29,481
but for now the guy
said I'm good.

1995
01:36:33,680 --> 01:36:35,272
I'm so happy.

1996
01:36:35,382 --> 01:36:36,576
You are happy?

1997
01:36:37,651 --> 01:36:39,949
Mmm-hmm. God, thank you. Thank you.

1998
01:36:50,630 --> 01:36:52,689
All right. Yeah.

1999
01:36:58,105 --> 01:36:59,231
You okay, man?

2000
01:36:59,339 --> 01:37:00,772
Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

2001
01:37:02,209 --> 01:37:03,198
I hope they
got some food.

2002
01:37:05,645 --> 01:37:06,669
Hey, hey.

2003
01:37:06,813 --> 01:37:08,474
Hi!
Hi.

2004
01:37:08,615 --> 01:37:11,982
I'm so glad you guys came. Hello. Hi.

2005
01:37:12,085 --> 01:37:13,643
Good to see you. Wow.
Hi. How's it going?

2006
01:37:13,754 --> 01:37:14,721
Hello, Ira.

2007
01:37:14,821 --> 01:37:17,221
Oh! Thank you.

2008
01:37:18,392 --> 01:37:20,383
Jeez. Beautiful house!

2009
01:37:20,494 --> 01:37:21,461
Thank you.

2010
01:37:21,595 --> 01:37:23,654
How long have
you guys been here?

2011
01:37:23,764 --> 01:37:25,857
We've been here
about five years now.

2012
01:37:27,067 --> 01:37:28,034
What's up?

2013
01:37:28,135 --> 01:37:31,036
This is my friend, George.
And this is Ira.

2014
01:37:31,138 --> 01:37:32,298
This is Ingrid.

2015
01:37:32,406 --> 01:37:35,671
Wow! George didn't mention
you had a daughter.

2016
01:37:36,543 --> 01:37:37,942
Have you seen
any of my movies?

2017
01:37:38,045 --> 01:37:40,536
I saw the movie where
you had a baby body.

2018
01:37:40,680 --> 01:37:43,740
<i>So, you saw Re-Do.
Can you do the face?</i>

2019
01:37:52,059 --> 01:37:53,890
Hey, that's
a good impression.

2020
01:37:54,261 --> 01:37:55,922
Don't leave me
in the playroom!

2021
01:37:56,029 --> 01:37:58,429
This is my daughter, Mable.
She just got braces.

2022
01:37:58,565 --> 01:37:59,793
Oh, yeah?
Let me see them.

2023
01:38:00,300 --> 01:38:03,565
You mind if I eat a little bit
of that sandwich right there?

2024
01:38:05,272 --> 01:38:07,001
Ira?
I'm... I'm full.

2025
01:38:07,107 --> 01:38:09,041
Do you guys want to play
the peanut-butter game?

2026
01:38:09,142 --> 01:38:11,235
It's fun.
You want to play?

2027
01:38:11,344 --> 01:38:12,743
Let's do it!
Ira?

2028
01:38:12,846 --> 01:38:14,006
Yeah, I like
peanut butter, yeah.

2029
01:38:14,114 --> 01:38:15,240
Let's do the
peanut-butter game!

2030
01:38:15,348 --> 01:38:16,474
All right!
Hooray!

2031
01:38:16,583 --> 01:38:19,643
Peanut-butter game!
Peanut-butter game!

2032
01:38:19,853 --> 01:38:20,945
Okay, just put
a little bit.

2033
01:38:21,054 --> 01:38:22,078
- Okay.
- What's she doing?

2034
01:38:22,189 --> 01:38:23,156
A little bit.

2035
01:38:24,591 --> 01:38:26,081
Okay, okay.
I think that's good.

2036
01:38:26,193 --> 01:38:29,060
This is what you guys do
in your free time? Okay.

2037
01:38:29,162 --> 01:38:30,493
- There he is!
- Oh, boy.

2038
01:38:30,597 --> 01:38:31,564
Come on.

2039
01:38:32,999 --> 01:38:34,728
He got her.
He got her.

2040
01:38:37,771 --> 01:38:40,035
Oh, so, you're supposed
to do it on the ears.

2041
01:38:40,173 --> 01:38:41,970
George's turn!
Yeah! George's turn!

2042
01:38:42,075 --> 01:38:43,269
No. I don't
want to do that.

2043
01:38:43,376 --> 01:38:44,900
Yeah, George's turn!
No, Ira will go. Let Ira go.

2044
01:38:45,011 --> 01:38:46,376
No, no, George.

2045
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:47,845
Come on.
Okay, all right!

2046
01:38:48,448 --> 01:38:50,313
I just washed
my hair this morning.

2047
01:38:50,417 --> 01:38:52,078
George! George!
George! George!

2048
01:38:54,354 --> 01:38:56,447
Oh, God!

2049
01:38:58,558 --> 01:38:59,547
No!

2050
01:38:59,659 --> 01:39:00,648
Just not the...

2051
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:01,727
Look at this.

2052
01:39:01,828 --> 01:39:03,295
That's
not the game!

2053
01:39:09,269 --> 01:39:12,864
And we have a pond
with a Buddha and...

2054
01:39:12,973 --> 01:39:13,940
Wow!

2055
01:39:17,944 --> 01:39:19,309
Does that hurt?

2056
01:39:19,412 --> 01:39:22,210
So, what... Who is a good...
You're a good guy, you're a bad guy?

2057
01:39:43,336 --> 01:39:46,999
Now I go.

2058
01:39:47,107 --> 01:39:48,506
And now I go.

2059
01:39:48,608 --> 01:39:50,744
You can't move.
You're stuck.

2060
01:39:50,844 --> 01:39:51,833
Ira.
- Hey.

2061
01:39:51,945 --> 01:39:54,641
Hey, Laura asked if we want
to eat dinner here tonight.

2062
01:39:55,415 --> 01:39:58,475
Oh. Thank you.
What... We...

2063
01:39:58,585 --> 01:39:59,711
It's like an eight-hour drive back.

2064
01:39:59,819 --> 01:40:02,447
We won't get home till like
5:00 in the morning that way.

2065
01:40:02,556 --> 01:40:03,580
We'll figure
something out.

2066
01:40:03,690 --> 01:40:07,387
So, we're gonna go to the grocery
store and get some food so I can cook.

2067
01:40:07,494 --> 01:40:09,359
Home-cooked meal. Perfect.

2068
01:40:09,462 --> 01:40:11,293
Okay. So, you're okay
to watch the girls?

2069
01:40:11,398 --> 01:40:13,093
Yeah, definitely.
I'm good with kids.

2070
01:40:13,200 --> 01:40:16,101
I was a... I was a Jewish summer
camp counselor for five years.

2071
01:40:17,671 --> 01:40:20,071
But I'm good with
non-Jewish kids, too.

2072
01:40:20,173 --> 01:40:22,471
Okay, so we'll be right back.
It's around the corner.

2073
01:40:22,576 --> 01:40:23,873
Very good.

2074
01:40:31,718 --> 01:40:34,551
Should I have worn my jogging
shoes? Where are we going?

2075
01:40:46,766 --> 01:40:48,631
You sure? You sure
you want to do this?

2076
01:40:48,735 --> 01:40:49,724
Mmm-hmm.

2077
01:40:49,836 --> 01:40:51,667
Wherever my husband is, he's
probably doing the same thing.

2078
01:40:51,771 --> 01:40:52,760
Mmm-hmm.

2079
01:40:52,872 --> 01:40:53,930
Okay.

2080
01:40:55,642 --> 01:40:56,609
Jesus.

2081
01:40:59,913 --> 01:41:01,471
Echo, echo, echo.

2082
01:41:06,386 --> 01:41:07,478
You know, when
I broke up with you,

2083
01:41:07,587 --> 01:41:11,489
I tried to find somebody who
was the exact opposite of you.

2084
01:41:14,127 --> 01:41:16,595
But Clarke
is exactly like you.

2085
01:41:18,098 --> 01:41:21,499
It's like I'm programmed
to find the same person,

2086
01:41:22,535 --> 01:41:25,971
like there's some lesson I'm
supposed to learn from it all.

2087
01:41:27,574 --> 01:41:30,042
How many times
did you cheat on me?

2088
01:41:30,710 --> 01:41:33,679
I don't want
to paint a picture.

2089
01:41:33,780 --> 01:41:37,910
I was young and stupid, but
I changed, I swear to God.

2090
01:41:39,185 --> 01:41:41,676
How exactly
have you changed?

2091
01:41:41,821 --> 01:41:46,019
I got a peek at something most
people only get to see once.

2092
01:41:48,161 --> 01:41:50,686
You know, I went to a
psychic who told me that...

2093
01:41:50,797 --> 01:41:55,200
That you and I would get
back together when we were 70.

2094
01:41:55,302 --> 01:41:57,702
And she also said
not to eat any chicken.

2095
01:41:58,438 --> 01:41:59,928
Well, we couldn't wait.

2096
01:42:00,040 --> 01:42:01,166
Mmm-hmm.

2097
01:42:01,441 --> 01:42:04,672
You loved me before
anybody loved me.

2098
01:42:04,778 --> 01:42:05,745
I know.

2099
01:42:11,484 --> 01:42:14,851
This is the only place
that I ever wanted to be.

2100
01:42:15,822 --> 01:42:18,313
When is George
gonna die?

2101
01:42:18,425 --> 01:42:20,416
George is gonna die?

2102
01:42:22,462 --> 01:42:24,623
No. Why would
you guys say that?

2103
01:42:24,731 --> 01:42:27,894
I heard my mom talking to her friend
on the phone, and she was crying.

2104
01:42:28,001 --> 01:42:29,764
I don't want
George to die.

2105
01:42:29,869 --> 01:42:31,496
Why do you care?
You just met him.

2106
01:42:31,604 --> 01:42:32,593
Shut up.

2107
01:42:32,706 --> 01:42:34,571
You shut up! Okay,
okay, guys, guys, guys.

2108
01:42:34,674 --> 01:42:36,073
George is not gonna die.

2109
01:42:36,176 --> 01:42:40,010
George, he was sick,
but he went to the doctor

2110
01:42:40,113 --> 01:42:41,637
and they gave him
different types of medicine

2111
01:42:41,748 --> 01:42:43,215
until they found
one that worked.

2112
01:42:43,316 --> 01:42:44,943
And now he's gonna
be just fine.

2113
01:42:45,051 --> 01:42:47,019
He's gonna live a really,
really long time.

2114
01:42:47,253 --> 01:42:49,244
I think my mommy loves him.

2115
01:42:50,423 --> 01:42:53,483
Well, you know,
we all love him.

2116
01:42:53,593 --> 01:42:55,060
He's made a lot
of great movies.

2117
01:42:55,161 --> 01:42:57,686
I think she loves him,
like, loves him.

2118
01:42:57,797 --> 01:42:59,856
Love.
Love, love, love.

2119
01:42:59,966 --> 01:43:03,663
<i>Love, love, love
They're gonna have a baby</i>

2120
01:43:03,903 --> 01:43:08,670
<i>They're gonna have a baby
Baby, marriage, love</i>

2121
01:43:09,409 --> 01:43:12,173
They're gonna have
a little MerMan baby.

2122
01:43:17,016 --> 01:43:20,679
You saved my acting reel? I
was wondering where this was.

2123
01:43:20,787 --> 01:43:22,118
Why didn't you
give this to me?

2124
01:43:22,222 --> 01:43:23,484
'Cause I was watching it.

2125
01:43:23,590 --> 01:43:26,354
<i>You know, I always get the feeling
that you think I'm stupid or something.</i>

2126
01:43:26,459 --> 01:43:28,620
Look at my hair!
I look like a leprechaun.

2127
01:43:28,728 --> 01:43:29,820
<i>No.</i>

2128
01:43:29,929 --> 01:43:30,953
<i>I am stupid.</i>

2129
01:43:31,064 --> 01:43:33,225
Ooh! Is my voice
still that high?

2130
01:43:33,333 --> 01:43:36,598
No! No, no, no, no. No, but they
need you back in Munchkinville.

2131
01:43:36,703 --> 01:43:38,364
They miss the mayor.

2132
01:43:38,471 --> 01:43:39,699
Shut up!

2133
01:43:40,106 --> 01:43:42,472
That was the best time
in my life.

2134
01:43:42,942 --> 01:43:45,536
I got something else for you.
You might remember these.

2135
01:43:46,379 --> 01:43:48,506
Please tell me you do!

2136
01:43:49,416 --> 01:43:50,815
Are these my favorite butt jeans?

2137
01:43:50,917 --> 01:43:52,282
Yes. Yes. Yes.

2138
01:43:52,419 --> 01:43:53,386
Really?

2139
01:43:53,486 --> 01:43:54,453
Yeah, you can
have them back.

2140
01:43:54,554 --> 01:43:55,816
I'm so excited!
Yeah.

2141
01:43:55,922 --> 01:43:57,389
Do you think
they still fit me?

2142
01:43:57,490 --> 01:43:58,479
I guarantee it.

2143
01:43:58,591 --> 01:43:59,649
I'm so happy!

2144
01:43:59,759 --> 01:44:02,387
I guarantee it.
Get in those.

2145
01:44:02,495 --> 01:44:04,326
These used to kill me. Oh,
my God, they're so faded.

2146
01:44:04,431 --> 01:44:05,921
Oh, shit!

2147
01:44:06,032 --> 01:44:07,021
They fit!

2148
01:44:07,133 --> 01:44:08,498
They look good!
Really?

2149
01:44:08,601 --> 01:44:10,125
Yeah, that's
the same ass!

2150
01:44:10,236 --> 01:44:14,297
Fucking ass is perfect. Minus
that camel coming out the back.

2151
01:44:14,407 --> 01:44:16,534
<i>Bump and groove it</i>

2152
01:44:16,643 --> 01:44:19,407
<i>To the left now
To the right, y'all</i>

2153
01:44:19,512 --> 01:44:20,479
<i>Slap that shit!</i>

2154
01:44:22,982 --> 01:44:25,109
Look at that!
They're like Mom jeans.

2155
01:44:25,218 --> 01:44:28,745
Oh, yes. If Mom needed
to get banged again.

2156
01:44:28,855 --> 01:44:29,822
Thank you.

2157
01:44:29,923 --> 01:44:31,288
Yeah, get over here.

2158
01:44:35,328 --> 01:44:37,819
Don't leave me.
Don't leave me.

2159
01:44:43,403 --> 01:44:45,997
Oh! Hey, guys,
what took you so long?

2160
01:44:46,105 --> 01:44:48,596
We were checking out
the town, man. Beautiful!

2161
01:44:48,708 --> 01:44:49,834
Where are
the groceries?

2162
01:44:49,943 --> 01:44:53,003
We decided that eating
in might be more fun.

2163
01:44:53,680 --> 01:44:55,648
Oh, no,
you didn't.

2164
01:44:55,748 --> 01:44:57,682
How could you
do that, man? No.

2165
01:44:58,017 --> 01:44:59,882
I didn't do
anything, Ira.

2166
01:44:59,986 --> 01:45:01,613
No, I know you did it.
I know you did.

2167
01:45:01,754 --> 01:45:04,120
All that's missing is
your Popsicle. Come on.

2168
01:45:04,224 --> 01:45:06,055
Ira, are you
cranky right now?

2169
01:45:06,159 --> 01:45:07,353
Do you need food
in your belly?

2170
01:45:07,460 --> 01:45:08,427
No.

2171
01:45:08,528 --> 01:45:09,344
Come on, we're gonna
order in a pizza.

2172
01:45:09,379 --> 01:45:10,161
Come on, we're gonna
order in a pizza.

2173
01:45:10,797 --> 01:45:13,857
<i>Of course,
Mr. Peters.</i>

2174
01:45:13,967 --> 01:45:14,934
<i>I'll be at the...</i>

2175
01:45:16,269 --> 01:45:17,566
<i>Lunch meeting.</i>

2176
01:45:18,605 --> 01:45:20,903
<i>You're serving seafood?</i>

2177
01:45:23,543 --> 01:45:25,408
<i>I love seafood!</i>

2178
01:45:26,079 --> 01:45:27,842
<i>Okay, see you there!</i>

2179
01:45:29,983 --> 01:45:31,473
Pizza's here!
Yeah.

2180
01:45:31,584 --> 01:45:32,983
I'll be right back.
Yes.

2181
01:45:33,086 --> 01:45:34,781
I'm the pizza monster!

2182
01:45:38,691 --> 01:45:40,659
Hi, honey!

2183
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:42,325
Clarke.
Hi, sweetie.

2184
01:45:42,428 --> 01:45:44,623
Hi. What are you
doing here?

2185
01:45:44,731 --> 01:45:46,426
Decided to surprise you.

2186
01:45:46,533 --> 01:45:49,297
The guy I was meant to have the
meeting with had a heart attack

2187
01:45:49,402 --> 01:45:50,664
while I was waiting
in reception for him.

2188
01:45:50,770 --> 01:45:52,203
It was unbelievable.
Wow.

2189
01:45:52,305 --> 01:45:53,932
Next minute, this Chinese
George Clooney guy

2190
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:55,302
comes running past
with, like, the...

2191
01:45:55,875 --> 01:45:57,103
What's it called?
A defibrillator?

2192
01:45:57,210 --> 01:45:58,507
Starts zapping him.
Right. Yeah, I've seen it.

2193
01:45:58,645 --> 01:46:00,977
<i>It was like an episode
of ER, but with Chinamen.</i>

2194
01:46:01,080 --> 01:46:03,071
I missed you.

2195
01:46:08,187 --> 01:46:09,154
I know you.

2196
01:46:09,255 --> 01:46:09,887
Yes.

2197
01:46:09,922 --> 01:46:10,520
Yes.

2198
01:46:11,858 --> 01:46:13,052
How you doing?

2199
01:46:13,693 --> 01:46:14,955
This is George Simmons.

2200
01:46:15,061 --> 01:46:16,585
He had a big comedy
concert last night.

2201
01:46:16,696 --> 01:46:17,663
Oh, okay.

2202
01:46:17,931 --> 01:46:20,729
And so, I asked him
to pop by and come visit.

2203
01:46:22,001 --> 01:46:23,525
Hope that's good. I...

2204
01:46:23,636 --> 01:46:25,103
I love the
stand-up comedy.

2205
01:46:25,438 --> 01:46:27,030
Yeah, yeah.
How'd it go?

2206
01:46:27,140 --> 01:46:31,338
They didn't... They didn't boo me
off the stage, so that was a plus.

2207
01:46:31,444 --> 01:46:34,607
Yeah, they're a bunch of
bloody cheese eaters up here.

2208
01:46:34,714 --> 01:46:36,443
Yeah. No, they were
very nice. Yeah.

2209
01:46:36,549 --> 01:46:39,040
You have a... You have
a very nice family, man,

2210
01:46:39,152 --> 01:46:40,619
and a great, great home.

2211
01:46:40,720 --> 01:46:42,153
Thank you.

2212
01:46:42,255 --> 01:46:43,654
Well, it's good
to have you home.

2213
01:46:43,756 --> 01:46:45,280
The kids are dying
to see you if...

2214
01:46:45,391 --> 01:46:48,292
Ira's hungry for...

2215
01:46:48,394 --> 01:46:49,383
G'day. Clarke.

2216
01:46:49,495 --> 01:46:51,156
Good day, I'm Ira.

2217
01:46:51,264 --> 01:46:52,822
Your husband's here.
- Yeah. Yep.

2218
01:46:52,932 --> 01:46:56,390
Ira is George's opening
act. He's really funny.

2219
01:46:56,502 --> 01:46:58,333
Really?
He looks funny!

2220
01:46:59,305 --> 01:47:00,272
Thank you.

2221
01:47:00,373 --> 01:47:01,806
How'd you go
last night?

2222
01:47:01,908 --> 01:47:04,433
You know, they didn't boo
me off or anything, so...

2223
01:47:04,544 --> 01:47:05,875
I just
said that one.

2224
01:47:05,979 --> 01:47:07,776
It was great.
Yeah.

2225
01:47:07,880 --> 01:47:10,075
They just popped by, I gave
them a tour of the house.

2226
01:47:10,183 --> 01:47:11,878
We were gonna have
dinner, but it's not...

2227
01:47:11,985 --> 01:47:14,044
It's probably better
that we do family dinner

2228
01:47:14,153 --> 01:47:15,279
since you're only
in town a few days.

2229
01:47:15,388 --> 01:47:16,446
No, stay.
That's a great idea.

2230
01:47:16,556 --> 01:47:17,750
The more the merrier.

2231
01:47:17,857 --> 01:47:19,017
Okay. Let's do that.

2232
01:47:19,325 --> 01:47:20,815
Thank you.
- Great.

2233
01:47:20,927 --> 01:47:21,894
I'm gonna go
say hi to the kids.

2234
01:47:21,995 --> 01:47:23,462
Okay.
Okay.

2235
01:47:23,563 --> 01:47:25,030
That's hilarious.

2236
01:47:25,131 --> 01:47:27,326
You can't tell him that
you're better, okay?

2237
01:47:27,433 --> 01:47:29,697
He'll know that something
happened between us.

2238
01:47:29,802 --> 01:47:30,860
I won't.
Okay?

2239
01:47:30,970 --> 01:47:33,268
'Cause I've been married for
12 years now and I have kids.

2240
01:47:33,373 --> 01:47:35,603
And I can't just throw
it away this second, okay?

2241
01:47:35,875 --> 01:47:40,141
Hey, we'll be fine. I'm a good
actor. You're a great actress.

2242
01:47:40,246 --> 01:47:43,238
Right. He hated you until he
found out that you were sick.

2243
01:47:43,349 --> 01:47:47,217
And if he knows that you were here and
that you're feeling better, he's gonna know.

2244
01:47:47,353 --> 01:47:48,411
So, don't say anything.

2245
01:47:48,521 --> 01:47:49,920
Okay, yeah, yeah.

2246
01:47:50,023 --> 01:47:51,786
Of course. Sure.
I'll do that.

2247
01:47:52,392 --> 01:47:54,724
People never thought China would
do that much business with the US,

2248
01:47:54,827 --> 01:47:57,352
but I never saw it as a big
deal. You look at it like this.

2249
01:47:57,463 --> 01:47:58,555
You've got
a billion people.

2250
01:47:58,665 --> 01:48:00,132
We make all kinds
of cool shit.

2251
01:48:00,233 --> 01:48:02,428
They find out about the cool shit,
like, on the Internet and stuff.

2252
01:48:02,535 --> 01:48:03,502
And they're gonna
want the cool shit.

2253
01:48:03,603 --> 01:48:05,366
Cool shit's universal.

2254
01:48:05,471 --> 01:48:07,701
China's been good, but I'm trying
to get into North Korea now.

2255
01:48:07,807 --> 01:48:09,331
That's the next... That's,
like, the next frontier.

2256
01:48:09,442 --> 01:48:11,171
Wow. Wow. North Korea? North Korea.

2257
01:48:11,310 --> 01:48:13,744
Those people would
blow you for a Wii Fit.

2258
01:48:13,846 --> 01:48:15,040
There you go.

2259
01:48:15,148 --> 01:48:16,911
This is really
good pizza.

2260
01:48:17,016 --> 01:48:18,779
You know, they say, like,
New York has the best pizza

2261
01:48:18,885 --> 01:48:20,750
and I always thought
pizza in LA was only okay,

2262
01:48:20,853 --> 01:48:21,877
but who would have
thought, you know,

2263
01:48:21,988 --> 01:48:26,618
Marin County is where they were
really hiding the good pizza pies.

2264
01:48:32,565 --> 01:48:34,465
Clarke speaks
fluent Chinese.

2265
01:48:34,567 --> 01:48:37,468
Really? Do you speak
Cantonese or Mandarin?

2266
01:48:37,570 --> 01:48:39,800
Oh, well played, Ira.
Mandarin.

2267
01:48:39,906 --> 01:48:41,601
Well gayed, Ira.

2268
01:48:41,708 --> 01:48:44,176
It's a bloody hard language,
though, George. Jesus.

2269
01:49:01,461 --> 01:49:03,292
<i>That was like a scene
from Deer Hunter.</i>

2270
01:49:06,599 --> 01:49:08,863
Girls, you can go
and watch TV.

2271
01:49:09,502 --> 01:49:12,164
Go on. Whatever you want to watch.

2272
01:49:13,272 --> 01:49:16,298
So, George, how's the fight going, mate?

2273
01:49:16,409 --> 01:49:17,376
How is it?

2274
01:49:17,477 --> 01:49:21,971
Clarke. This is not something that
he wants to talk about right now.

2275
01:49:22,081 --> 01:49:25,482
He has to think about
it every day of his life.

2276
01:49:25,585 --> 01:49:28,418
And he's taking a
break from it right now.

2277
01:49:28,521 --> 01:49:35,290
It's such a shame that somebody
who has brought so much joy

2278
01:49:35,394 --> 01:49:38,090
to so many people
has to go through this.

2279
01:49:39,031 --> 01:49:41,864
Shit. Shit.

2280
01:49:41,968 --> 01:49:42,957
I'm sorry, mate.

2281
01:49:43,069 --> 01:49:47,096
Laura. Laura. We don't
need to speak in code.

2282
01:49:47,206 --> 01:49:49,333
I'm sick. I think
about it all the time.

2283
01:49:49,442 --> 01:49:50,670
Mate, I don't know how you do it.

2284
01:49:50,777 --> 01:49:53,268
I would be crying
in my panties if I was you.

2285
01:49:53,412 --> 01:49:55,403
I worship guys
like you, that attitude.

2286
01:49:55,515 --> 01:49:56,982
Have you considered
Eastern medicine?

2287
01:49:57,083 --> 01:49:59,916
Well, I don't know if this is
considered Eastern medicine,

2288
01:50:00,019 --> 01:50:02,112
but I've been eating
a lot of rhino cock.

2289
01:50:02,221 --> 01:50:06,055
If Clarke thinks it's the right
thing to do, let me chew some.

2290
01:50:06,159 --> 01:50:08,093
For the last time,
stop calling me Rhino.

2291
01:50:11,264 --> 01:50:13,061
George Simmons
in my house!

2292
01:50:13,166 --> 01:50:17,227
Clarke took an herb once, and he
had heart palpitations and diarrhea.

2293
01:50:17,370 --> 01:50:18,803
No, it's true.
I shit myself, mate,

2294
01:50:18,905 --> 01:50:20,304
and I had a boner
at the same time.

2295
01:50:22,942 --> 01:50:25,240
I want to take an herb that
makes me as good-looking as you.

2296
01:50:25,344 --> 01:50:26,936
Jesus Christ!

2297
01:50:27,046 --> 01:50:29,241
If I were you I'd be at home
all day fucking myself.

2298
01:50:29,348 --> 01:50:30,315
That's what I do!

2299
01:50:32,185 --> 01:50:34,380
All right! All right!
We're cooking.

2300
01:50:34,821 --> 01:50:36,345
He's really funny.
Mmm-hmm.

2301
01:50:36,589 --> 01:50:38,181
I don't know why his movies
aren't funny, though.

2302
01:50:38,291 --> 01:50:39,781
That's weird, isn't it? Mmm-hmm.

2303
01:50:39,892 --> 01:50:41,382
He should put some of that
on the silver screen.

2304
01:50:41,494 --> 01:50:42,756
So, just one drink,
okay?

2305
01:50:42,862 --> 01:50:45,422
This isn't someone I want
to spend a lot of time with.

2306
01:50:45,531 --> 01:50:47,431
This?
This is the Australian me?

2307
01:50:47,533 --> 01:50:49,160
I'm so much better
than this fucking idiot.

2308
01:50:49,268 --> 01:50:50,496
He seems like
the nicest guy, ever.

2309
01:50:50,603 --> 01:50:52,400
He's trying to cure you
with herbs for God's sakes.

2310
01:50:52,505 --> 01:50:54,564
I can't leave her alone here.
I have to save her.

2311
01:50:54,674 --> 01:50:56,699
Save her from her beautiful
house and lovely husband

2312
01:50:56,809 --> 01:50:57,935
and delightful kids?

2313
01:50:58,044 --> 01:50:59,602
Her husband's a skipping,
cheating psycho.

2314
01:50:59,712 --> 01:51:01,236
You said nothing was
going on between you two.

2315
01:51:01,347 --> 01:51:03,212
The dog could tell
that you banged her.

2316
01:51:03,316 --> 01:51:04,544
And I'm getting nauseous
and sweaty. I can't...

2317
01:51:04,650 --> 01:51:07,710
Get away from me! Get away
from me! Go play with the kids.

2318
01:51:09,889 --> 01:51:12,517
<i>Tim, are you
asking me out on a date?</i>

2319
01:51:12,625 --> 01:51:14,058
<i>Would you like
it to be a date?</i>

2320
01:51:14,160 --> 01:51:15,957
<i>Hey, bro,
so your doctor called</i>

2321
01:51:16,062 --> 01:51:19,361
<i>and he said it is contagious, but
only when inflamed, so you're cool.</i>

2322
01:51:20,566 --> 01:51:21,999
<i>Also, I was trying
to do the laundry,</i>

2323
01:51:22,101 --> 01:51:24,467
<i>but I think I need to get some
industrial-strength detergent.</i>

2324
01:51:24,570 --> 01:51:26,936
<i>What's up with all the skid
marks, Dale Earnhardt, Jr?</i>

2325
01:51:27,039 --> 01:51:29,667
<i>Wow, I think
I have a class.</i>

2326
01:51:29,775 --> 01:51:31,072
You guys like this show?

2327
01:51:31,177 --> 01:51:32,303
No!

2328
01:51:32,411 --> 01:51:34,504
It's the worst show, ever.

2329
01:51:34,614 --> 01:51:35,581
Good.

2330
01:51:36,382 --> 01:51:38,316
Here you go. We're finished
with the French shit.

2331
01:51:38,417 --> 01:51:39,975
<i>We're into espaola!</i>

2332
01:51:40,086 --> 01:51:41,610
All right.

2333
01:51:42,455 --> 01:51:44,116
China, man.
Wow.

2334
01:51:44,223 --> 01:51:46,987
And you guys never see each
other, huh? That must be rough.

2335
01:51:47,093 --> 01:51:48,253
Right? Rough on the kids.

2336
01:51:48,361 --> 01:51:51,524
It's not ideal, but the
kids like to eat, so...

2337
01:51:53,266 --> 01:51:56,135
You ever see this girl act
before? She was quite the actress.

2338
01:51:56,302 --> 01:51:58,167
Well, she's very good at
pretending she still loves me,

2339
01:51:58,271 --> 01:51:59,863
so she's pretty
good then, isn't she?

2340
01:51:59,972 --> 01:52:01,530
Yeah. I am.

2341
01:52:02,708 --> 01:52:05,643
<i>Can't say I watched much of
that Melrose Place stuff, though.</i>

2342
01:52:05,745 --> 01:52:07,440
<i>Although I did see the Party
of Five episode you were in.</i>

2343
01:52:07,546 --> 01:52:09,514
It wasn't really
for me, you know.

2344
01:52:09,715 --> 01:52:14,709
<i>Well, it was down to me and Cameron
Diaz for the lead part in The Mask.</i>

2345
01:52:14,820 --> 01:52:16,913
Cameron Diaz!
That's my girl.

2346
01:52:17,023 --> 01:52:18,991
She's a bloody top
actress, isn't she?

2347
01:52:19,091 --> 01:52:21,821
Hey, what was that film she was in
with the bloody spuff in her hair?

2348
01:52:21,994 --> 01:52:23,120
<i>Something About Mary!</i>

2349
01:52:24,330 --> 01:52:27,231
I love that movie!
She's so funny!

2350
01:52:27,333 --> 01:52:29,130
Just about shit my panties in that one.

2351
01:52:29,335 --> 01:52:30,495
No, no, no, there's
not too many girls

2352
01:52:30,603 --> 01:52:34,130
that are this beautiful
and sexy and funny and...

2353
01:52:34,240 --> 01:52:35,502
She had the whole deal.

2354
01:52:35,608 --> 01:52:41,012
Yes, but Cameron Diaz, fuck!
I mean, come on.

2355
01:52:42,214 --> 01:52:43,272
See, if you had've
done that movie,

2356
01:52:43,382 --> 01:52:44,906
you could have had the
bloody spuff in your hair.

2357
01:52:45,017 --> 01:52:45,984
Look out.

2358
01:52:46,085 --> 01:52:47,052
What are you giving
me the evil eyes for?

2359
01:52:47,153 --> 01:52:48,279
You're such
a dick sometimes.

2360
01:52:48,387 --> 01:52:49,445
I'm not... Why?

2361
01:52:49,555 --> 01:52:50,544
Because.

2362
01:52:50,690 --> 01:52:53,523
I'm just saying you had your
crack, you had your go at it.

2363
01:52:53,626 --> 01:52:55,457
I feel like I didn't
reach my potential that...

2364
01:52:55,561 --> 01:52:56,823
Oh, please!

2365
01:52:56,929 --> 01:52:57,896
Oh, please, what?

2366
01:52:57,997 --> 01:52:59,123
I didn't reach
my potential, either!

2367
01:52:59,231 --> 01:53:00,528
I could have been
playing footie!

2368
01:53:00,633 --> 01:53:01,622
You weren't that good

2369
01:53:01,734 --> 01:53:02,860
at playing footie.
I was.

2370
01:53:02,969 --> 01:53:03,936
You weren't.

2371
01:53:04,937 --> 01:53:08,338
You should thank me, George.
I took a bullet here for you.

2372
01:53:08,441 --> 01:53:11,376
All right, on that note, I'm
gonna head back to Los Angeles.

2373
01:53:11,477 --> 01:53:12,466
No, come on, stay.

2374
01:53:12,578 --> 01:53:13,545
No, it's fine.
I'll split.

2375
01:53:13,646 --> 01:53:14,670
It's early.
I've been here too long.

2376
01:53:14,780 --> 01:53:15,974
Schmira! We just started a bottle.

2377
01:53:16,082 --> 01:53:18,949
Nah, nah, nah. You guys
have been the best. Schmira!

2378
01:53:19,051 --> 01:53:21,611
Thank you so much
for having us, guys. Oh!

2379
01:53:21,754 --> 01:53:23,415
Shoot.
- Uh-oh! Look out.

2380
01:53:23,522 --> 01:53:24,489
God, I'm sorry, guys.

2381
01:53:24,590 --> 01:53:25,557
Someone's
had too much to drink.

2382
01:53:25,691 --> 01:53:28,683
Oh, man, no. No, I just kicked your
pot by accident, that's all. I...

2383
01:53:29,028 --> 01:53:30,893
Hold it together there,
Schmira. I'm just a... Oh, God.

2384
01:53:30,997 --> 01:53:31,964
It's okay.

2385
01:53:32,064 --> 01:53:33,224
You're staying here.
You're not driving.

2386
01:53:33,332 --> 01:53:35,926
No way. We got a guest house,
two spare beds. Done.

2387
01:53:36,035 --> 01:53:37,627
You two, plenty of room to
stay. No, no. Ira can drive.

2388
01:53:37,737 --> 01:53:39,102
He... You're fine
to drive, right, Ira?

2389
01:53:39,205 --> 01:53:41,002
I am. I just kicked
your begonias, that's all.

2390
01:53:41,107 --> 01:53:44,133
No way! I'm not having America's favorite
funnyman dead on the side of the road

2391
01:53:44,243 --> 01:53:45,801
'cause Schmira here's
had too much to drink.

2392
01:53:45,911 --> 01:53:47,037
George, you can
drive, right?

2393
01:53:47,146 --> 01:53:49,171
Bullshit!
You're staying here.

2394
01:53:49,315 --> 01:53:52,876
Plus, there's a game of Aussie-rules
footie on the dish tonight.

2395
01:53:52,985 --> 01:53:54,350
Semi-final.
Saints versus Maggies.

2396
01:53:54,453 --> 01:53:56,614
Not that American shit.
I want you to see it.

2397
01:53:56,722 --> 01:53:59,748
One condition. You Aussie
pussies got any beer around here?

2398
01:53:59,859 --> 01:54:01,486
Yes, it's on...

2399
01:54:02,862 --> 01:54:03,886
Yes!

2400
01:54:04,497 --> 01:54:06,488
Yeah, it doesn't matter if you're
a small fucker or a big fucker,

2401
01:54:06,599 --> 01:54:08,760
you can play this game because
the small fuckers go in barreling

2402
01:54:08,868 --> 01:54:10,699
and they can get the ball over
and the boys are scrambling.

2403
01:54:10,803 --> 01:54:12,100
Now watch. The little
fuckers down there go.

2404
01:54:12,204 --> 01:54:14,138
There they are.
Big fuckers smack them.

2405
01:54:14,240 --> 01:54:16,674
Little fucker. Little fucker.
Off to a big fucker.

2406
01:54:16,776 --> 01:54:20,371
Now he's gonna go down to another
big fucker. I hate that big fucker.

2407
01:54:20,479 --> 01:54:21,446
Where are the black guys?

2408
01:54:21,547 --> 01:54:22,980
This is...
There's a couple out there.

2409
01:54:23,082 --> 01:54:24,481
I hate this team.
Oh, yeah?

2410
01:54:24,583 --> 01:54:26,050
Magpies.
Hate the Maggies!

2411
01:54:26,152 --> 01:54:30,088
They're like... I don't know
what the equivalent in the NFL...

2412
01:54:30,256 --> 01:54:34,693
No helmets. No fucking helmets
'cause they're real men. See?

2413
01:54:34,794 --> 01:54:38,252
Love you. Just explaining the
game to them. They're loving it!

2414
01:54:46,272 --> 01:54:47,762
Yeah, we gotta get
going, you know.

2415
01:54:47,873 --> 01:54:49,841
Are you sure
you can't stay?

2416
01:54:49,942 --> 01:54:51,500
We can't stay.
We can't stay.

2417
01:54:51,610 --> 01:54:54,579
Yeah, it's my... It's my
grandmother's 85th birthday.

2418
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:55,647
We got family
coming in from all over.

2419
01:54:55,748 --> 01:54:56,715
That's right.

2420
01:54:56,816 --> 01:54:59,307
She just had a stroke.
In her leg.

2421
01:54:59,418 --> 01:55:00,680
So, you know,
we gotta get back.

2422
01:55:00,786 --> 01:55:01,753
Yeah.

2423
01:55:01,854 --> 01:55:03,481
That's too bad
you guys can't stay.

2424
01:55:03,589 --> 01:55:04,886
It is too bad.

2425
01:55:05,091 --> 01:55:07,423
Well, I wish I could say I was
gonna see you again, George,

2426
01:55:07,526 --> 01:55:09,460
but I can't really
say that, can I?

2427
01:55:09,562 --> 01:55:11,860
Yeah, yeah,
I guess you can't.

2428
01:55:11,964 --> 01:55:12,931
You don't have
to do that, honey.

2429
01:55:13,032 --> 01:55:15,330
No, I do have to do this, honey. I do.

2430
01:55:15,434 --> 01:55:16,560
You know what, mate?

2431
01:55:16,669 --> 01:55:20,036
If there's one thing I've learned
from my Buddhist friends, the Chinese,

2432
01:55:20,139 --> 01:55:23,631
is to keep an open heart
and to speak the truth.

2433
01:55:23,742 --> 01:55:27,644
So, what I want to say to
you, George, is thank you.

2434
01:55:28,647 --> 01:55:32,481
Thank you for playing such
a big role in my wife's life.

2435
01:55:34,086 --> 01:55:36,054
It's been great
getting to know you.

2436
01:55:36,155 --> 01:55:41,058
And I wish you a peaceful journey from
here on in and over to the other side.

2437
01:55:41,160 --> 01:55:42,320
Come here, mate.

2438
01:55:42,428 --> 01:55:44,896
Okay, we're gonna
do this.

2439
01:55:46,265 --> 01:55:48,324
Thank you. Thank you for everything.

2440
01:55:48,434 --> 01:55:49,401
All right.

2441
01:55:49,502 --> 01:55:50,628
Thank you.

2442
01:55:50,736 --> 01:55:52,966
All right,
I appreciate your having us.

2443
01:55:53,072 --> 01:55:56,303
Don't worry, Daddy.
He's not sick anymore.

2444
01:55:56,408 --> 01:55:57,636
Ira told us.

2445
01:55:57,743 --> 01:55:58,903
I didn't say that.

2446
01:55:59,011 --> 01:55:59,978
Yes, you did.
Yeah, you did.

2447
01:56:00,079 --> 01:56:02,013
When we were coloring.
- No.

2448
01:56:02,114 --> 01:56:03,138
Yeah.
Yeah.

2449
01:56:03,249 --> 01:56:04,273
That's not
true, girls.

2450
01:56:04,383 --> 01:56:05,714
No, that's not true.
- I did not say that.

2451
01:56:05,818 --> 01:56:07,115
I don't know what
they're talking about.

2452
01:56:07,219 --> 01:56:08,447
Liar.

2453
01:56:08,554 --> 01:56:10,419
Liar, liar,
pants on fire.

2454
01:56:10,523 --> 01:56:12,787
They were freaking out. They
were worried about George.

2455
01:56:12,892 --> 01:56:14,985
I just said it so they wouldn't
be scared. It was just...

2456
01:56:15,094 --> 01:56:16,493
Kids, go inside.

2457
01:56:16,595 --> 01:56:18,529
<i>Can we watch Borat? Yeah, you can.</i>

2458
01:56:18,631 --> 01:56:20,030
<i>I don't wanna watch
Borat. Yes, you... Come on.</i>

2459
01:56:20,132 --> 01:56:21,565
See you guys.

2460
01:56:22,835 --> 01:56:25,861
What is going on around
here? Is that true?

2461
01:56:25,971 --> 01:56:28,201
I never said that
he was feeling better.

2462
01:56:28,307 --> 01:56:30,798
He just took some medicine
and it's looking good for him

2463
01:56:30,910 --> 01:56:32,309
because they can't
detect it in his blood,

2464
01:56:32,411 --> 01:56:34,879
but that doesn't mean
that he's better.

2465
01:56:34,980 --> 01:56:36,447
These things
are very tricky

2466
01:56:36,549 --> 01:56:39,677
and he didn't want to tell anybody
because he didn't want to jinx it!

2467
01:56:39,785 --> 01:56:41,150
Is that true that you
didn't want to jinx it?

2468
01:56:41,253 --> 01:56:43,278
Yeah. No, no, no, I...
Yeah, I'm very superstitious.

2469
01:56:43,389 --> 01:56:44,378
Mmm-hmm.

2470
01:56:44,490 --> 01:56:46,014
You're a terrible liar.

2471
01:56:46,125 --> 01:56:51,028
No, nothing's going on
around here!

2472
01:56:51,130 --> 01:56:53,564
It's completely innocent.

2473
01:56:53,666 --> 01:56:55,099
I left me ring...
What accent is that?

2474
01:56:55,201 --> 01:56:57,135
...on the side table.
Jamaican?

2475
01:56:57,469 --> 01:56:59,562
Don't mock me.
I don't appreciate it.

2476
01:57:00,072 --> 01:57:02,233
Lots of people
go to massage parlors.

2477
01:57:02,341 --> 01:57:04,969
That doesn't mean I was
getting a rub-and-tug.

2478
01:57:05,077 --> 01:57:10,481
Those hairs on me jacket must've
fallen off the waiter's pussy.

2479
01:57:10,983 --> 01:57:12,575
What the hell has
gotten into you?

2480
01:57:12,685 --> 01:57:14,915
I was at a footie game!

2481
01:57:15,020 --> 01:57:16,612
Are you taking
the piss out of me?

2482
01:57:16,722 --> 01:57:21,455
I would never lie
to you, mate. Oi?

2483
01:57:22,461 --> 01:57:23,428
I'm not playing
this game with you.

2484
01:57:23,529 --> 01:57:25,997
This is stupid.
What a stupid game!

2485
01:57:26,865 --> 01:57:29,595
Clarke, let's tell
each other the truth.

2486
01:57:30,569 --> 01:57:31,536
Just come
clean with me.

2487
01:57:31,637 --> 01:57:32,797
There's nothing to tell.

2488
01:57:32,905 --> 01:57:33,894
There's nothing to tell?

2489
01:57:34,006 --> 01:57:34,973
There's nothing to tell.

2490
01:57:35,074 --> 01:57:38,771
You will never tell me the
truth. That is a pussy move!

2491
01:57:38,877 --> 01:57:40,367
You know what?
I'm not doing this.

2492
01:57:40,479 --> 01:57:43,676
I'm not being put on a cross
for something I didn't even do!

2493
01:57:43,782 --> 01:57:44,942
Enjoy each other!

2494
01:57:45,050 --> 01:57:46,347
Go fuck your whores!

2495
01:57:47,052 --> 01:57:49,520
"Go fuck your whores"?

2496
01:57:57,363 --> 01:57:59,394
So, it's good that he left, and
this is a huge relief for me.

2497
01:57:59,429 --> 01:58:01,425
So, it's good that he left, and
this is a huge relief for me.

2498
01:58:01,533 --> 01:58:03,558
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

2499
01:58:03,669 --> 01:58:08,231
I don't need to be in a marriage
that is like that, so I'm fine.

2500
01:58:08,340 --> 01:58:11,639
I'm not worried about that.
I just want you to be okay.

2501
01:58:11,744 --> 01:58:12,870
I would be scared
if I was you right now.

2502
01:58:12,978 --> 01:58:13,967
Are you kidding me?

2503
01:58:14,079 --> 01:58:15,205
This is what
needed to happen.

2504
01:58:15,314 --> 01:58:16,747
I would run away.

2505
01:58:16,849 --> 01:58:17,816
No, I'm staying here.

2506
01:58:17,916 --> 01:58:18,883
Are you gonna run away?

2507
01:58:18,984 --> 01:58:21,680
Where am I running to?
Only if you come with me.

2508
01:58:21,787 --> 01:58:24,278
I really need
you around right now.

2509
01:58:24,390 --> 01:58:25,379
Yeah. Yeah.

2510
01:58:25,491 --> 01:58:26,549
Can you stay till Monday?

2511
01:58:26,659 --> 01:58:27,956
Absolutely.

2512
01:58:28,060 --> 01:58:30,460
Can't we just go and, like,
come back later, you know?

2513
01:58:30,562 --> 01:58:32,553
I mean, if this is
meant to be, it'll be.

2514
01:58:32,665 --> 01:58:34,257
We don't have to be
here right this second.

2515
01:58:34,366 --> 01:58:35,333
Can't we just go?

2516
01:58:35,434 --> 01:58:37,026
Man, I don't... I see...

2517
01:58:37,136 --> 01:58:40,401
Jesus Christ, every instinct in my
body is telling me to leave here, too.

2518
01:58:40,773 --> 01:58:41,740
Good.

2519
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:43,239
But that's what led me
to this shitty life.

2520
01:58:43,342 --> 01:58:47,676
I gotta stay here. I gotta do
the right thing. I love her.

2521
01:58:47,780 --> 01:58:52,308
Right now, her husband is gonna
come back and murder us, man!

2522
01:58:52,418 --> 01:58:54,318
Did you see his arms?
They look like legs!

2523
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:55,910
Shut up.
Don't be an idiot.

2524
01:58:56,021 --> 01:59:00,549
I'm not being an... Imagine that
you are a gigantic Australian man

2525
01:59:00,693 --> 01:59:03,457
and someone came into your
home and fucked your wife.

2526
01:59:03,562 --> 01:59:06,531
You would murder him and then you
would make a hat out of his skin

2527
01:59:06,699 --> 01:59:08,530
'cause that's what
Australians do. Let's go!

2528
01:59:08,767 --> 01:59:11,531
Ira, this is deep shit.
People get divorced.

2529
01:59:11,637 --> 01:59:15,164
They make mistakes,
they change their lives.

2530
01:59:16,408 --> 01:59:19,866
It's not that big of a deal.
She's married to an asshole.

2531
01:59:19,978 --> 01:59:21,946
She seems like
a crazy actress, man.

2532
01:59:22,047 --> 01:59:23,446
I don't know what
to tell you, man.

2533
01:59:23,549 --> 01:59:25,176
Am I not allowed
to be happy or something?

2534
01:59:25,284 --> 01:59:28,583
I've been living alone and
alone and alone. That's my life.

2535
01:59:28,687 --> 01:59:30,120
This is the only girl
I've ever loved

2536
01:59:30,222 --> 01:59:31,814
and I'm not supposed
to do anything about this?

2537
01:59:32,658 --> 01:59:33,989
When am I supposed
to be happy?

2538
01:59:34,093 --> 01:59:36,857
Why does everyone
else get to be happy?

2539
01:59:36,962 --> 01:59:39,863
Look, George, I'm just gonna
tell you this, as a friend.

2540
01:59:40,632 --> 01:59:43,328
From where I'm sitting
it seems like your happiness

2541
01:59:43,435 --> 01:59:46,302
might be coming at the cost
of destroying this family.

2542
01:59:47,272 --> 01:59:49,763
Okay, let me respond
to that, as your friend,

2543
01:59:49,875 --> 01:59:52,207
and let you know
you're not my friend.

2544
01:59:52,311 --> 01:59:54,245
You fucking work for me!

2545
01:59:54,346 --> 01:59:58,806
I didn't ask for your advice! You're
overstepping your boundaries, man!

2546
01:59:58,917 --> 02:00:01,078
Now go get me
a fucking Diet Coke!

2547
02:00:01,186 --> 02:00:03,780
And remind yourself
that's what you do for me!

2548
02:00:03,889 --> 02:00:05,151
Now get the fuck
out of here!

2549
02:00:05,257 --> 02:00:06,224
Fine.

2550
02:00:07,226 --> 02:00:10,127
Don't fucking leave! Sit down
here! I don't want to be alone.

2551
02:00:10,229 --> 02:00:11,958
Okay, fine.

2552
02:00:14,566 --> 02:00:15,533
<i>This is Mark.</i>

2553
02:00:15,634 --> 02:00:17,192
Hey, Mark, it's Ira.
How's it going, man?

2554
02:00:17,636 --> 02:00:20,537
Not too good. I didn't get the
part in the Tobey Maguire movie.

2555
02:00:20,639 --> 02:00:22,937
<i>That doesn't matter. I have
a problem. I need help, okay?</i>

2556
02:00:23,041 --> 02:00:24,167
<i>Where have you been?</i>

2557
02:00:24,276 --> 02:00:27,006
I'm in Marin County.
Northern California.

2558
02:00:27,112 --> 02:00:29,808
Listen, I...
I have to tell you something.

2559
02:00:30,082 --> 02:00:31,743
<i>Are you sitting down?</i>

2560
02:00:31,850 --> 02:00:32,817
<i>Yeah.
Okay.</i>

2561
02:00:33,852 --> 02:00:35,217
The other night
I went out to drinks

2562
02:00:35,320 --> 02:00:36,309
with the producers
of my show

2563
02:00:36,422 --> 02:00:38,151
and Leo met up with us.

2564
02:00:38,257 --> 02:00:40,452
And they were enamored by him and
they thought he was really funny.

2565
02:00:40,559 --> 02:00:43,392
<i>And they offered him a part
on Yo Teach...! and he took it.</i>

2566
02:00:43,495 --> 02:00:45,929
I saw the episode.
I know that that happened.

2567
02:00:46,031 --> 02:00:47,191
<i>You watched it?
I watched it.</i>

2568
02:00:47,299 --> 02:00:48,266
<i>Did you love it?</i>

2569
02:00:49,001 --> 02:00:50,866
Yeah.
He was great, right?

2570
02:00:50,969 --> 02:00:52,869
<i>It was fine! I have no
problem with Leo, okay?</i>

2571
02:00:52,971 --> 02:00:54,063
<i>Tell Leo, if he's
got a problem,</i>

2572
02:00:54,173 --> 02:00:56,471
<i>to stop being a baby
and to just get over it!</i>

2573
02:00:56,575 --> 02:00:57,599
Why don't you
tell Leo yourself?

2574
02:00:57,709 --> 02:00:59,734
'Cause Leo's been surveilling
this whole conversation.

2575
02:01:00,045 --> 02:01:01,103
<i>You dick.
- Fucking asshole.</i>

2576
02:01:01,213 --> 02:01:03,010
<i>Leo, get off the phone!
Screw you, Leo. Screw you.</i>

2577
02:01:03,115 --> 02:01:04,480
Hey, man what have
you been up to?

2578
02:01:04,583 --> 02:01:05,880
<i>Sucking George
Simmons' balls?</i>

2579
02:01:05,984 --> 02:01:08,248
<i>That's cool. I've been on
Yo Teach...! living it up.</i>

2580
02:01:08,353 --> 02:01:09,843
<i>I'm sorry, Leo.
Yo Teach...! sucks.</i>

2581
02:01:09,955 --> 02:01:11,047
<i>Go lose some
more weight, Ira!</i>

2582
02:01:11,156 --> 02:01:12,180
<i>You look fucking
weird skinny!</i>

2583
02:01:12,758 --> 02:01:14,089
<i>Leo, calm down!</i>

2584
02:01:14,193 --> 02:01:16,457
You know what, Ira? I want to
put my eyeglasses on your asshole

2585
02:01:16,562 --> 02:01:19,395
so it looks like you're blowing me when
I'm fucking you in the ass, you jerk!

2586
02:01:19,498 --> 02:01:20,465
<i>That doesn't
even make sense!</i>

2587
02:01:20,566 --> 02:01:22,864
<i>You're gonna put glasses
on my ass? What?</i>

2588
02:01:22,968 --> 02:01:26,870
Ira, we will find something
for you to do on the show, okay?

2589
02:01:26,972 --> 02:01:28,439
Teach can have
more than one friend.

2590
02:01:28,540 --> 02:01:29,768
Can we talk
about this later?

2591
02:01:29,875 --> 02:01:32,673
I am in a serious problem. I just
need some advice, okay? Please?

2592
02:01:32,778 --> 02:01:36,270
Just listen to me for two minutes and
tell me what I should do right now, okay?

2593
02:01:36,381 --> 02:01:37,473
Will you do that?

2594
02:01:37,583 --> 02:01:40,279
All right. If it's serious,
I'm sorry. I will listen.

2595
02:01:41,820 --> 02:01:43,720
Okay. Here's
what's happening.

2596
02:01:43,822 --> 02:01:45,619
<i>I'm witnessing
a slow-moving train wreck,</i>

2597
02:01:45,724 --> 02:01:47,749
<i>but if I do something,
I will lose my job.</i>

2598
02:01:47,860 --> 02:01:48,827
Are you serious?

2599
02:01:48,927 --> 02:01:50,326
<i>So, what
I don't know, is...</i>

2600
02:01:50,629 --> 02:01:52,722
Screw you.

2601
02:01:54,266 --> 02:01:54,763
Higher!
Higher!

2602
02:01:54,798 --> 02:01:55,260
Higher!
Higher!

2603
02:01:55,367 --> 02:01:56,356
I can't. I... I can't. Yes, you can.

2604
02:01:56,468 --> 02:01:57,935
You, you have to go
down a little bit then

2605
02:01:58,036 --> 02:01:59,731
through the middle. Be careful.
Don't let him fall on you.

2606
02:01:59,838 --> 02:02:00,805
Where do I put my hand?

2607
02:02:01,607 --> 02:02:06,510
I spoke to Clarke. He's gonna be at the
airport tonight heading back to China.

2608
02:02:06,645 --> 02:02:09,205
I'm gonna go tell him
that when he comes back

2609
02:02:09,448 --> 02:02:11,882
he should find
another place to live.

2610
02:02:11,984 --> 02:02:13,212
Wait, wait,
wait, wait. What...

2611
02:02:13,318 --> 02:02:16,082
You... Yeah? Good. Good. Yeah.

2612
02:02:16,522 --> 02:02:17,511
You're gonna tell him?

2613
02:02:17,623 --> 02:02:18,988
I just don't want
him coming back here.

2614
02:02:19,091 --> 02:02:20,353
You don't need him.
No.

2615
02:02:20,459 --> 02:02:22,518
That'll just
get you sick.

2616
02:02:22,628 --> 02:02:25,495
Good, you gotta tell him.
So, when are you doing that?

2617
02:02:25,597 --> 02:02:26,564
Tonight?
Yeah.

2618
02:02:26,698 --> 02:02:27,665
Okay, okay,
I'm coming down.

2619
02:02:27,766 --> 02:02:28,733
Jump!

2620
02:02:29,668 --> 02:02:30,692
I talked to a girlfriend of mine,

2621
02:02:30,802 --> 02:02:32,861
and she has somebody
who could show us

2622
02:02:33,038 --> 02:02:35,131
some houses down
in Los Angeles.

2623
02:02:35,507 --> 02:02:36,701
And we'll get that
whole thing going.

2624
02:02:36,808 --> 02:02:41,245
And then I was thinking about
taking the kids out of school now,

2625
02:02:41,346 --> 02:02:44,440
but we should probably let them
finish up because it's December.

2626
02:02:44,550 --> 02:02:46,074
And I don't want
to mess everything up.

2627
02:02:46,184 --> 02:02:47,981
They have to finish
the whole year here.

2628
02:02:48,086 --> 02:02:49,485
Yeah, that makes sense to
me. So, if we just go down

2629
02:02:49,588 --> 02:02:50,885
at the beginning
of the summer,

2630
02:02:50,989 --> 02:02:52,320
let them kind of transit.
I'm supposed to do

2631
02:02:52,424 --> 02:02:53,948
a little two-week
tour this summer.

2632
02:02:54,059 --> 02:02:56,357
I'm supposed to do it,
but I don't need to do it.

2633
02:02:56,528 --> 02:02:59,964
No pressure on you. Look at
you! There's no pressure on you.

2634
02:03:00,065 --> 02:03:04,195
I need to work and I want to
get my acting career going again.

2635
02:03:04,303 --> 02:03:06,032
Good.
Yeah.

2636
02:03:06,138 --> 02:03:08,698
She's whupping you, Ingrid!
Good job there, Lulu.

2637
02:03:09,975 --> 02:03:11,670
So, she's gonna go
to the airport tonight

2638
02:03:11,777 --> 02:03:14,678
and tell Clarke that she wants
him to find a new place and...

2639
02:03:15,948 --> 02:03:17,939
What do you
think of that?

2640
02:03:18,050 --> 02:03:20,211
I don't want to tell
you what I think about that

2641
02:03:20,319 --> 02:03:21,843
'cause I don't want
to get yelled at, George.

2642
02:03:21,954 --> 02:03:23,444
Oh, God.

2643
02:03:23,555 --> 02:03:26,217
I'm just nervous about the kids
and, like, who's gonna get them

2644
02:03:26,325 --> 02:03:28,486
and does he get one
and Laura gets one,

2645
02:03:28,594 --> 02:03:30,186
or am I gonna
have both of them?

2646
02:03:30,295 --> 02:03:32,320
'Cause I love the little
one, we kind of click.

2647
02:03:32,431 --> 02:03:36,197
But the older one is, like, you
sense the period's coming soon.

2648
02:03:36,301 --> 02:03:37,962
I think she would
probably get the kids.

2649
02:03:38,070 --> 02:03:39,059
All right, yeah.

2650
02:03:39,171 --> 02:03:41,264
I don't think you can
have two girls in China.

2651
02:03:41,406 --> 02:03:42,873
What are you gonna do
now? Look at this crew.

2652
02:03:42,975 --> 02:03:44,237
Why so close?
Really?

2653
02:03:45,410 --> 02:03:47,071
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

2654
02:03:47,179 --> 02:03:48,806
You okay, little girl?
You okay?

2655
02:03:48,914 --> 02:03:50,313
Oh, man.
Are you okay?

2656
02:03:50,449 --> 02:03:52,041
Okay. I'm gonna show
you Mable singing...

2657
02:03:52,150 --> 02:03:53,139
Mom, you make
everybody see...

2658
02:03:53,251 --> 02:03:55,412
<i>No, Memory from Cats.
Come on! It's...</i>

2659
02:03:55,587 --> 02:03:57,214
No. I hate that you
show it to everyone.

2660
02:03:57,322 --> 02:03:58,812
I'll just show
them the end part.

2661
02:04:00,792 --> 02:04:03,158
I'll just show you
the ending. Okay.

2662
02:04:17,442 --> 02:04:23,438
<i>Burnt-out ends
of smoky days</i>

2663
02:04:24,316 --> 02:04:30,186
<i>The stale cold smell
of morning</i>

2664
02:04:31,623 --> 02:04:38,324
<i>The streetlamp dies,
another night is over</i>

2665
02:04:38,830 --> 02:04:43,995
<i>Another day is dawning</i>

2666
02:04:46,438 --> 02:04:48,998
<i>Touch me</i>

2667
02:04:49,174 --> 02:04:55,602
<i>It's so easy to leave me
All alone with the memory</i>

2668
02:04:56,314 --> 02:04:59,340
<i>Of my days in the sun</i>

2669
02:05:00,719 --> 02:05:04,815
<i>If you touch me You'll
understand what happiness is</i>

2670
02:05:08,393 --> 02:05:14,354
<i>Look, a new day has begun</i>

2671
02:05:22,240 --> 02:05:23,207
That was unbelievable!

2672
02:05:23,308 --> 02:05:24,969
Isn't that good?

2673
02:05:26,611 --> 02:05:28,545
That was insane!

2674
02:05:28,647 --> 02:05:32,515
That was like just seeing a little
person sing an old person's song.

2675
02:05:32,617 --> 02:05:34,448
That was hysterical!

2676
02:05:34,586 --> 02:05:38,386
I got a friend who takes...
He takes a lot of acid.

2677
02:05:38,490 --> 02:05:41,084
If he saw that,
he would shit himself!

2678
02:05:42,694 --> 02:05:43,922
That's not supposed
to be funny.

2679
02:05:44,029 --> 02:05:44,996
I know, I know,
I know. I'm...

2680
02:05:45,097 --> 02:05:47,258
No, I think that's
why it's funnier.

2681
02:05:47,365 --> 02:05:48,332
It was so amazing.

2682
02:05:48,433 --> 02:05:49,400
Wasn't that good?

2683
02:05:49,501 --> 02:05:51,162
I think I started
crying a little bit.

2684
02:05:51,269 --> 02:05:54,238
Me, too. I cry
every time I see that.

2685
02:05:56,341 --> 02:05:59,003
That shit was
funny up there.

2686
02:05:59,111 --> 02:06:02,945
Okay. Wow, these guys are not
gonna take no for an answer.

2687
02:06:03,782 --> 02:06:05,909
Yeah. They want me to do
another baby movie.

2688
02:06:06,017 --> 02:06:08,645
They keep bumping up
the gross on the DVDs.

2689
02:06:08,787 --> 02:06:11,415
I just... There's no way I'm doing it.

2690
02:06:18,096 --> 02:06:19,393
Okay. Bye.

2691
02:06:24,569 --> 02:06:26,628
Hey, George.

2692
02:06:26,738 --> 02:06:28,069
Yeah.

2693
02:06:28,173 --> 02:06:29,902
I'm going to...
I'm gonna go to the store

2694
02:06:30,008 --> 02:06:31,168
and grab some
cigarettes, okay?

2695
02:06:31,309 --> 02:06:32,401
I'll be back soon.

2696
02:06:32,511 --> 02:06:34,775
What? What do you
need cigarettes for?

2697
02:06:34,880 --> 02:06:36,370
'Cause I'm addicted
to them.

2698
02:06:36,481 --> 02:06:38,449
Why? 'Cause you look like
the Fonz when you smoke?

2699
02:06:38,550 --> 02:06:41,246
I've always smoked. I just didn't do
it in front of you 'cause you were sick.

2700
02:06:41,353 --> 02:06:42,877
And now that
you're better...

2701
02:06:42,988 --> 02:06:45,582
Hurry up, though, man. I'm running
out of gas with the kids here.

2702
02:06:45,690 --> 02:06:46,918
Okay. I'll hurry up.

2703
02:06:47,726 --> 02:06:53,426
<i>Memory,
all alone in the moonlight</i>

2704
02:06:55,367 --> 02:06:58,598
<i>I can't wait
till the morning</i>

2705
02:07:09,414 --> 02:07:11,780
Are my parents
getting a divorce?

2706
02:07:14,786 --> 02:07:17,254
Why... Why...
Why do you ask that?

2707
02:07:17,889 --> 02:07:21,552
Just, like, I can tell.
They're always fighting and...

2708
02:07:22,060 --> 02:07:23,687
How does that
make you feel?

2709
02:07:23,795 --> 02:07:25,922
Well, he's already
away a lot,

2710
02:07:26,031 --> 02:07:30,229
so it doesn't really
matter that much, but...

2711
02:07:30,669 --> 02:07:32,227
Uh-huh.

2712
02:07:32,337 --> 02:07:34,271
That wouldn't be fun.

2713
02:07:34,372 --> 02:07:37,102
Maybe it would be better
if they were separated.

2714
02:07:37,209 --> 02:07:38,198
Mmm-mmm.

2715
02:07:38,310 --> 02:07:39,607
No?

2716
02:07:39,711 --> 02:07:41,144
That's not good.

2717
02:07:41,246 --> 02:07:42,213
Right.

2718
02:08:04,069 --> 02:08:05,229
Clarke?

2719
02:08:07,105 --> 02:08:11,201
Laura, what are
you doing here?

2720
02:08:11,309 --> 02:08:13,140
I don't know.

2721
02:08:13,645 --> 02:08:17,445
<i>Mr. Way Chen, you need to get to
the information desk. Thank you.</i>

2722
02:08:20,418 --> 02:08:21,385
<i>You've reached Ira.</i>

2723
02:08:21,486 --> 02:08:22,578
<i>Please leave me a message.
Thank you.</i>

2724
02:08:23,788 --> 02:08:25,517
Where are you?
You gotta come back here.

2725
02:08:25,624 --> 02:08:28,559
I think I'm getting...
I'm getting lonely here.

2726
02:08:28,660 --> 02:08:31,629
<i>I need some help.
Just, seriously, hurry up.</i>

2727
02:08:32,597 --> 02:08:36,328
I don't trust you.
Am I imagining things?

2728
02:08:37,869 --> 02:08:40,064
You're not imagining
anything, honey.

2729
02:08:41,339 --> 02:08:44,331
Two times. That's all
I did was two times.

2730
02:08:44,442 --> 02:08:46,910
And I don't want to ruin everything
just 'cause of two fucking times.

2731
02:08:47,012 --> 02:08:48,639
She couldn't
even speak English.

2732
02:08:52,717 --> 02:08:54,708
Look at our life. You're
driving the kids to school.

2733
02:08:54,819 --> 02:08:56,753
You're picking them up.
You're like a single mother.

2734
02:08:56,855 --> 02:08:59,653
And you're not a single mom.
You're my wife. You're my baby.

2735
02:08:59,758 --> 02:09:02,420
I shouldn't be in China

2736
02:09:02,527 --> 02:09:05,792
trying to sell Oreos to people who
don't want to fucking talk to me.

2737
02:09:05,897 --> 02:09:08,889
I'm gonna get a normal job. I'm
gonna be just around the corner.

2738
02:09:09,000 --> 02:09:11,662
It's just gonna be
you, me and the kids.

2739
02:09:12,070 --> 02:09:14,698
All I want
is a fresh start.

2740
02:09:14,806 --> 02:09:15,773
Yeah.

2741
02:09:23,515 --> 02:09:24,914
Oh.

2742
02:09:25,016 --> 02:09:25,983
Yeah.

2743
02:09:30,055 --> 02:09:32,649
The George Simmons thing
was just a flirtation.

2744
02:09:32,757 --> 02:09:36,716
It was nothing. He really
was sick. He just got better.

2745
02:09:37,762 --> 02:09:39,593
I'm so fucking glad.
Yeah.

2746
02:09:39,698 --> 02:09:42,929
I really like him. I do.
I don't want to hate him.

2747
02:09:43,935 --> 02:09:45,732
I fucking love you.

2748
02:09:54,012 --> 02:09:55,036
Ira!

2749
02:09:57,515 --> 02:09:59,210
Hey!

2750
02:09:59,317 --> 02:10:00,284
What are you
doing here?

2751
02:10:01,720 --> 02:10:03,984
I'm going back
to Los Angeles.

2752
02:10:04,789 --> 02:10:05,756
LA?

2753
02:10:05,857 --> 02:10:07,085
Yeah.

2754
02:10:07,192 --> 02:10:09,251
You're in the Great China Air
First Class Lounge, mate.

2755
02:10:09,361 --> 02:10:10,328
What are you doing?

2756
02:10:10,428 --> 02:10:13,727
Oh. Shit, this is
a confusing airport.

2757
02:10:13,865 --> 02:10:16,595
I thought this
was Panda Express.

2758
02:10:16,701 --> 02:10:19,397
Well, it's good
to see you guys, though.

2759
02:10:19,504 --> 02:10:22,598
What's going on?
Laura?

2760
02:10:22,707 --> 02:10:25,835
What the hell
is going on?

2761
02:10:25,944 --> 02:10:27,434
Uh... Ask her.

2762
02:10:28,179 --> 02:10:30,409
I was so mad at you for the
way that you've been treating me

2763
02:10:30,515 --> 02:10:33,541
that I was on my way
here to tell you tonight

2764
02:10:33,685 --> 02:10:35,653
to find another place
to live when you got back.

2765
02:10:35,754 --> 02:10:36,982
But then...
I came here to stop her.

2766
02:10:37,088 --> 02:10:38,112
Shut the fuck up.

2767
02:10:38,223 --> 02:10:41,215
I slept with George
once, but it's over.

2768
02:10:41,326 --> 02:10:43,920
It's done.
And it was no big deal.

2769
02:10:45,130 --> 02:10:48,691
We didn't even have sex.
He just went down on me.

2770
02:10:48,800 --> 02:10:50,267
That's worse.

2771
02:10:50,368 --> 02:10:51,357
Crikey.

2772
02:10:51,469 --> 02:10:53,937
He manipulated me
with his disease!

2773
02:10:55,740 --> 02:10:58,334
Where is he?
George, where is he?

2774
02:10:58,443 --> 02:10:59,876
He's at your house.

2775
02:10:59,978 --> 02:11:02,606
He's at our house?
With our kids?

2776
02:11:03,314 --> 02:11:04,941
Please don't get
that look on your face.

2777
02:11:05,050 --> 02:11:06,381
Please don't get
that look on your face.

2778
02:11:06,484 --> 02:11:07,508
It was a mistake.
I'm gonna kill him.

2779
02:11:07,619 --> 02:11:09,712
No, no, no, no, no.

2780
02:11:09,821 --> 02:11:11,288
I'm sorry.

2781
02:11:11,389 --> 02:11:12,378
You're sorry?

2782
02:11:12,524 --> 02:11:13,752
I came here to stop...
Who are you?

2783
02:11:13,858 --> 02:11:14,984
I don't know.
Who are you?

2784
02:11:15,093 --> 02:11:16,720
What are you doing here?

2785
02:11:16,828 --> 02:11:18,193
I was trying to help you.

2786
02:11:18,296 --> 02:11:19,763
Get the fuck
out of my life!

2787
02:11:19,864 --> 02:11:21,525
Okay.

2788
02:11:21,633 --> 02:11:26,332
Oh, no. Oh, no.
Oh, no. Oh, no.

2789
02:11:26,438 --> 02:11:32,399
Where is it? Where is it?
Oh, God, where is it?

2790
02:11:32,644 --> 02:11:36,546
So stupid! Stupid shit!

2791
02:11:40,151 --> 02:11:41,833
<i>I wanted to tell you I miss
you. I miss your kisses.</i>

2792
02:11:41,868 --> 02:11:43,515
<i>I wanted to tell you I miss
you. I miss your kisses.</i>

2793
02:11:43,621 --> 02:11:47,284
<i>I miss your short skirts.
And I miss your smell.</i>

2794
02:11:50,495 --> 02:11:51,985
<i>Get the BabyBjrn.</i>

2795
02:11:52,097 --> 02:11:54,588
<i>We're gonna go find
that wizard.</i>

2796
02:11:54,699 --> 02:11:57,463
Hey, girls.
You look so cute.

2797
02:11:58,536 --> 02:12:00,128
You, outside.

2798
02:12:00,238 --> 02:12:01,205
Is he in trouble?

2799
02:12:01,306 --> 02:12:02,432
Yes.

2800
02:12:09,247 --> 02:12:10,805
What's gonna happen?
I don't know.

2801
02:12:10,915 --> 02:12:12,246
What do you think I did?

2802
02:12:12,350 --> 02:12:13,339
Oh, shit!

2803
02:12:13,451 --> 02:12:15,282
Your friend sold
you out, mate!

2804
02:12:15,386 --> 02:12:16,375
No, no, no, Clarke!

2805
02:12:16,488 --> 02:12:18,183
You think this is a game? Stop it!

2806
02:12:18,289 --> 02:12:19,256
What'd you think
you were gonna do?

2807
02:12:19,357 --> 02:12:21,188
Come in and just
fuck up my family?

2808
02:12:21,292 --> 02:12:23,021
Stop it!
- Is that what you thought?

2809
02:12:23,128 --> 02:12:24,117
Stop it. Stop.
No, no, no, no!

2810
02:12:24,229 --> 02:12:26,060
I didn't fucking do anything!
This sort of shit I kill for!

2811
02:12:26,164 --> 02:12:27,461
Don't kill him!
Don't kill him!

2812
02:12:27,565 --> 02:12:29,055
You stupid shit!

2813
02:12:29,167 --> 02:12:30,134
No!

2814
02:12:30,235 --> 02:12:31,224
Fuck, man!

2815
02:12:31,336 --> 02:12:32,963
Come here!
Run, George!

2816
02:12:33,071 --> 02:12:35,198
Don't hurt him,
you maniac!

2817
02:12:36,374 --> 02:12:37,636
Cut the shit,
guys!

2818
02:12:37,742 --> 02:12:38,709
Stop it!

2819
02:12:40,078 --> 02:12:43,241
Run, George! You're cornering
yourself! Go that way!

2820
02:12:43,348 --> 02:12:44,679
Get away from me! Take
it like a man, George!

2821
02:12:44,782 --> 02:12:46,647
Get away from me,
you fucking crazy asshole!

2822
02:12:46,751 --> 02:12:49,481
You fucking asshole!
Get away!

2823
02:12:50,788 --> 02:12:52,278
Oh, my God.

2824
02:12:52,390 --> 02:12:54,381
She's not happy with you!

2825
02:12:54,492 --> 02:12:57,256
No one who's married
is happy, you idiot!

2826
02:12:58,096 --> 02:13:00,428
Get in a ball, George!
Get in a ball!

2827
02:13:00,532 --> 02:13:02,159
Fight like a man! Get
on your feet, would you?

2828
02:13:02,267 --> 02:13:05,236
I don't know how to fight! I'm
a comedian, you fucking asshole!

2829
02:13:05,336 --> 02:13:06,303
Should I jump in?

2830
02:13:06,404 --> 02:13:08,099
No! No! Don't jump in!

2831
02:13:08,206 --> 02:13:10,174
Just get away from me, man! You traitor!

2832
02:13:10,275 --> 02:13:12,334
Go get more cigarettes,
you liar!

2833
02:13:12,443 --> 02:13:13,671
I accomplished nothing!

2834
02:13:13,778 --> 02:13:15,678
They made up
before I got there!

2835
02:13:16,915 --> 02:13:18,883
Where's your
helmet now, Yankee?

2836
02:13:18,983 --> 02:13:21,451
Let's talk! Clarke!

2837
02:13:21,553 --> 02:13:23,145
Clarke, no!

2838
02:13:23,254 --> 02:13:25,085
Come on, pussy!

2839
02:13:25,190 --> 02:13:26,157
Help!

2840
02:13:27,225 --> 02:13:28,419
All right!

2841
02:13:28,526 --> 02:13:29,515
Stop!

2842
02:13:29,627 --> 02:13:31,356
I got him! I got him!
You don't want this, Schmira.

2843
02:13:31,462 --> 02:13:33,191
You don't want
a piece of me, Schmira!

2844
02:13:33,298 --> 02:13:34,959
I am gonna love this!

2845
02:13:36,534 --> 02:13:37,899
God!

2846
02:13:38,002 --> 02:13:40,630
You son of a bitch! I knew
you didn't want me to be happy!

2847
02:13:40,738 --> 02:13:43,832
What are you doing, man? Look
at this! You fucking suck!

2848
02:13:43,942 --> 02:13:45,375
You've gone crazy!
You're a lightweight...

2849
02:13:45,476 --> 02:13:46,602
Get away from me, man!

2850
02:13:46,711 --> 02:13:49,179
...named Ira Wiener!
Ira Wiener!

2851
02:13:49,280 --> 02:13:51,214
You should have died!
Well, I ain't going nowhere!

2852
02:13:51,316 --> 02:13:52,874
I'm never gonna die!
I hope you die!

2853
02:13:52,984 --> 02:13:54,713
I'm never gonna die, baby! Die!

2854
02:13:54,819 --> 02:13:56,013
Boys, stop it! I hope
you die! I hate you!

2855
02:13:56,120 --> 02:13:57,553
I know what you're trying
to do, the pair of you!

2856
02:13:57,655 --> 02:13:59,623
You're trying to distract me
so I won't hit him!

2857
02:13:59,724 --> 02:14:01,021
Lackey! Lackey!

2858
02:14:01,125 --> 02:14:02,114
Wait!

2859
02:14:02,227 --> 02:14:04,195
Oh, shit,
Clarke! Dude!

2860
02:14:04,295 --> 02:14:05,523
Are you okay,
George?

2861
02:14:05,630 --> 02:14:07,427
Where's your
stunt man now, hey?

2862
02:14:07,532 --> 02:14:08,499
Stop it!

2863
02:14:08,600 --> 02:14:11,034
Will you stop hitting me?

2864
02:14:12,170 --> 02:14:14,730
I'm better now,
but it can come back!

2865
02:14:16,441 --> 02:14:18,875
Laura, tell him.
Tell him what you told me.

2866
02:14:19,410 --> 02:14:22,846
Tell him that you love me more
than you love him. Tell him!

2867
02:14:23,081 --> 02:14:24,207
Yeah, when she
told you that,

2868
02:14:24,315 --> 02:14:26,442
did she think
you were dying, huh?

2869
02:14:27,185 --> 02:14:29,710
Tell him. Tell him.
Is it me or him?

2870
02:14:32,757 --> 02:14:34,088
Him.

2871
02:14:34,192 --> 02:14:38,526
What? Come on!
Are you serious?

2872
02:14:39,497 --> 02:14:42,557
He's my husband.
We have a family.

2873
02:14:43,468 --> 02:14:44,935
I love him.

2874
02:14:45,403 --> 02:14:48,668
<i>And you didn't even cry
when Mable sang Cats.</i>

2875
02:14:49,274 --> 02:14:50,832
What's the matter with you?

2876
02:14:51,542 --> 02:14:53,908
I didn't want to lie.
I don't know.

2877
02:14:54,012 --> 02:14:56,344
I've seen it
on Broadway before.

2878
02:14:57,682 --> 02:14:59,650
It wasn't as good as it.

2879
02:15:01,286 --> 02:15:03,516
What are you guys
doing on the lawn?

2880
02:15:03,621 --> 02:15:05,179
I'm hungry!

2881
02:15:05,923 --> 02:15:08,983
Nothing. We're just...
We're just mucking around.

2882
02:15:09,093 --> 02:15:11,118
Come on. Go back inside.

2883
02:15:17,468 --> 02:15:21,529
Sorry, George.
I'll always love you.

2884
02:15:22,573 --> 02:15:24,768
But what are we gonna do?

2885
02:15:24,876 --> 02:15:26,343
I love you.

2886
02:15:27,245 --> 02:15:29,577
I'm sorry I came up here.
I shouldn't have come.

2887
02:15:30,748 --> 02:15:32,375
No, I'm glad you did.

2888
02:15:33,618 --> 02:15:35,313
Maybe when we're 70?

2889
02:15:37,655 --> 02:15:39,782
I hope you find
a way to be happy.

2890
02:15:40,325 --> 02:15:43,260
Shit. He's coming back.
He's coming back. Let's go.

2891
02:15:43,961 --> 02:15:45,326
Clarke.

2892
02:15:45,430 --> 02:15:49,196
You know what? I've just worked
out why all this shit has happened.

2893
02:15:49,300 --> 02:15:51,495
In the East,
they call this karma.

2894
02:15:51,602 --> 02:15:55,766
And I have brought all this
shit upon us with my misbehavior.

2895
02:15:55,873 --> 02:15:57,966
That's why all this shit has happened.

2896
02:15:58,609 --> 02:16:00,270
This had to happen.

2897
02:16:01,045 --> 02:16:03,309
But some good shit's
gonna come from this.

2898
02:16:03,781 --> 02:16:06,249
We have to learn from this,
you know, all of us.

2899
02:16:06,351 --> 02:16:08,285
There's a good lesson here.

2900
02:16:09,721 --> 02:16:12,281
Underneath anger is hurt,

2901
02:16:13,358 --> 02:16:16,691
but underneath
hurt is love.

2902
02:16:17,428 --> 02:16:18,827
You feel it?

2903
02:16:22,033 --> 02:16:23,261
Okay?

2904
02:16:23,368 --> 02:16:24,392
Yeah. Thank you.

2905
02:16:24,502 --> 02:16:25,491
I'm sorry about this.

2906
02:16:25,603 --> 02:16:28,538
Yeah, yeah.
Don't worry about it.

2907
02:16:44,555 --> 02:16:45,579
Do you want me to drive?

2908
02:16:46,791 --> 02:16:49,919
No, you don't have to
drive me. I'll drive myself.

2909
02:16:50,928 --> 02:16:55,160
In fact, you're never gonna have to
drive me again because you're fired, Ira.

2910
02:16:55,566 --> 02:16:57,796
You're the only person
that I've ever heard of

2911
02:16:57,902 --> 02:16:59,995
that learned nothing from a
near-death experience, George.

2912
02:17:00,104 --> 02:17:01,696
You went backwards.
You're worse.

2913
02:17:01,806 --> 02:17:04,001
You know what I am?
A good friend.

2914
02:17:04,108 --> 02:17:07,566
I would never run to the
airport and rat somebody out.

2915
02:17:07,678 --> 02:17:11,341
I don't have that in my DNA.
That's not a friend, man.

2916
02:17:11,449 --> 02:17:13,781
A friend tells you. A friend
comes up to you and says,

2917
02:17:13,885 --> 02:17:16,012
"Hey, you're in a heap of
shit. You better not do it. "

2918
02:17:16,120 --> 02:17:19,112
He doesn't run
and tell the fucking girl.

2919
02:17:19,223 --> 02:17:20,247
Well...
Wow.

2920
02:17:20,358 --> 02:17:22,417
Good. Fire me. I don't want
to be around you anymore,

2921
02:17:22,527 --> 02:17:24,654
'cause you are
fucking contagious!

2922
02:17:24,762 --> 02:17:26,992
You think I can't
get another assistant?

2923
02:17:27,098 --> 02:17:29,658
I can't get someone else
to write jokes for me?

2924
02:17:29,767 --> 02:17:33,601
You think I'm gonna lay in my bed
going, "Aw, I miss my Schmira"?

2925
02:17:34,172 --> 02:17:37,141
You're a fucking no-thought.
That's the beauty.

2926
02:17:37,241 --> 02:17:39,937
Once you're gone it never
comes back in my brain.

2927
02:17:40,044 --> 02:17:41,568
You think getting Laura
would have made you happy?

2928
02:17:41,679 --> 02:17:43,510
I know so. You think if
you had a family right now,

2929
02:17:43,614 --> 02:17:44,876
you would be happy?

2930
02:17:44,982 --> 02:17:48,179
You'll never be happy, 'cause you're
always gonna be stuck with yourself!

2931
02:17:48,286 --> 02:17:51,346
Unless somehow you can
get away from you,

2932
02:17:51,456 --> 02:17:53,890
you're always gonna
be miserable, George.

2933
02:17:53,991 --> 02:17:56,016
You are not funny.

2934
02:17:56,127 --> 02:17:58,220
Well, if that means
I'm less like you,

2935
02:17:58,329 --> 02:18:00,627
then good, I don't
want to be funny, okay?

2936
02:18:01,199 --> 02:18:03,167
Mission accomplished, Ira.

2937
02:18:04,669 --> 02:18:06,227
Bad career choice.

2938
02:18:06,904 --> 02:18:09,998
Comedy usually
is for funny people.

2939
02:18:10,107 --> 02:18:11,335
Gotcha.

2940
02:19:10,801 --> 02:19:13,292
<i>Chances are you've got a lot of stuff
stuffed in your drawers and closets</i>

2941
02:19:13,404 --> 02:19:14,393
<i>that you don't really need.</i>

2942
02:19:14,505 --> 02:19:17,201
<i>Mary Bolster is editor-in-chief
of Natural Health magazine.</i>

2943
02:19:17,475 --> 02:19:20,376
<i>She's here to help you get
trashing, bagging and get organized.</i>

2944
02:19:20,478 --> 02:19:22,070
<i>Hello, Mary.
- Hi, Hoda.</i>

2945
02:19:22,179 --> 02:19:25,307
<i>Okay, we do save things
for the wackiest reasons.</i>

2946
02:19:28,920 --> 02:19:30,512
Good morning. Hi.

2947
02:19:32,590 --> 02:19:34,854
I think I'm gonna
forgive him today.

2948
02:19:34,959 --> 02:19:36,290
What? Really?
Yeah.

2949
02:19:36,394 --> 02:19:38,555
Great!
That's great news!

2950
02:19:38,663 --> 02:19:41,223
<i>He's just gonna be so jealous
that I'm on Yo Teach...! You know?</i>

2951
02:19:41,332 --> 02:19:43,266
I just figured it'd
be a cool thing to do.

2952
02:19:43,367 --> 02:19:46,302
Well, maybe we could
find something for him.

2953
02:19:46,804 --> 02:19:50,865
You know, if it comes up organically,
definitely, but we shouldn't force it.

2954
02:19:50,975 --> 02:19:52,169
You know?
Right.

2955
02:19:52,276 --> 02:19:54,267
<i>I don't want to be
on Yo Teach...!</i>

2956
02:19:55,479 --> 02:19:57,071
It's okay.
I forgave you, you know?

2957
02:19:57,181 --> 02:19:58,273
Thank you.

2958
02:19:59,450 --> 02:20:03,250
So, how'd everything go
up there this weekend?

2959
02:20:03,955 --> 02:20:08,983
I think I did the right thing, but George
fired me and punched me in the face.

2960
02:20:10,962 --> 02:20:12,554
You want to talk about it?

2961
02:20:12,663 --> 02:20:13,630
No.

2962
02:20:15,132 --> 02:20:18,499
I kind of wish you would. It sounds
like the greatest story, ever.

2963
02:20:20,237 --> 02:20:22,569
Wake me up at 2:00.
I'll tell you about it.

2964
02:20:23,641 --> 02:20:26,235
Well, we're glad
you're back.

2965
02:20:26,344 --> 02:20:27,641
Glad you're home.

2966
02:20:27,745 --> 02:20:30,270
I can't believe I have
to start all over again.

2967
02:20:31,449 --> 02:20:34,043
Hey, man,
how you doing?

2968
02:20:34,385 --> 02:20:35,613
Hey, how you doing?
Heard you were sick.

2969
02:20:35,720 --> 02:20:37,517
You feeling better now?
Over here!

2970
02:20:37,622 --> 02:20:40,113
George, second lease on life.
What are you gonna do now?

2971
02:20:40,224 --> 02:20:41,282
Hey, guys, come on.
Come on, I heard rumors

2972
02:20:41,392 --> 02:20:42,757
about another baby movie.
What do you got, huh?

2973
02:20:42,860 --> 02:20:44,851
Yeah, yeah, we're gonna shoot
that. That should be good.

2974
02:20:44,962 --> 02:20:46,896
Gonna start that in a little
bit. Let me get by you, though.

2975
02:20:59,276 --> 02:21:00,903
It's nice up here, huh?

2976
02:21:01,012 --> 02:21:03,105
Yeah.
How'd you find it?

2977
02:21:04,315 --> 02:21:07,113
Me and my friends, we hike
up here and I always thought,

2978
02:21:07,218 --> 02:21:08,344
"You know, that'd be
a great place to take

2979
02:21:08,452 --> 02:21:10,943
"a woman if you...
If you knew one. "

2980
02:21:12,156 --> 02:21:13,214
Well, now
you know one.

2981
02:21:13,324 --> 02:21:14,348
Good.

2982
02:21:29,940 --> 02:21:30,964
Hey, I'm gonna
give him the light.

2983
02:21:31,075 --> 02:21:32,042
Thanks, Mark.

2984
02:21:33,944 --> 02:21:35,605
Bailey,
you're number two.

2985
02:21:42,520 --> 02:21:44,351
Hey, Ira.
How you doing?

2986
02:21:44,455 --> 02:21:45,422
Good. How you doing?

2987
02:21:45,523 --> 02:21:46,581
Wassup, big money?

2988
02:21:46,691 --> 02:21:47,817
You guys know
each other?

2989
02:21:47,925 --> 02:21:50,359
Yes. I've seen this
young Jewish comedian.

2990
02:21:50,928 --> 02:21:52,589
Randy, what's happening?

2991
02:21:52,697 --> 02:21:55,860
I saw this cat down at Otto's
yesterday. Made me a little panini.

2992
02:21:56,801 --> 02:21:59,326
Grilled chicken pesto.
Shit was nice.

2993
02:21:59,770 --> 02:22:01,931
Yeah, I'm working
at Otto's again.

2994
02:22:02,907 --> 02:22:04,306
So,
you're going up?

2995
02:22:04,642 --> 02:22:07,236
Yeah, I'm about to go
up now. See you guys.

2996
02:22:08,979 --> 02:22:10,105
Later!

2997
02:22:11,916 --> 02:22:14,180
<i>Thank you. Thank you.</i>

2998
02:22:14,285 --> 02:22:17,743
<i>My friends are very sexually
aggressive, which is hard for me.</i>

2999
02:22:17,855 --> 02:22:19,652
<i>You know, we'll watch television
and they'll just see...</i>

3000
02:22:19,757 --> 02:22:21,657
<i>A hot girl will come on
and they'll just be,</i>

3001
02:22:21,759 --> 02:22:25,217
<i>"Man, I wanna fuck the shit
out of that girl, man!</i>

3002
02:22:25,329 --> 02:22:27,024
<i>"I'm gonna
fuck that girl!"</i>

3003
02:22:27,131 --> 02:22:28,291
<i>And I, like,
can't even say that.</i>

3004
02:22:28,399 --> 02:22:29,889
<i>I can't even pretend
I would do that.</i>

3005
02:22:30,000 --> 02:22:31,365
<i>I see a hot girl
on TV and I'm like,</i>

3006
02:22:31,469 --> 02:22:34,802
<i>"Man, I would friend
the shit out of her!</i>

3007
02:22:36,006 --> 02:22:40,807
<i>"I'd friend her all night!
I would be her girlfriend!</i>

3008
02:22:41,312 --> 02:22:44,281
<i>"I would drive her
to the airport, man!</i>

3009
02:22:45,616 --> 02:22:49,552
<i>"I would hold her purse while
she shopped, all over her tits!"</i>

3010
02:22:56,494 --> 02:22:57,791
Thank you.

3011
02:22:58,796 --> 02:23:02,288
Hi, I need a pound of turkey and a
half-pint of macaroni salad, please.

3012
02:23:04,535 --> 02:23:06,628
Um... Yeah, I'll just be one sec, okay?

3013
02:23:06,737 --> 02:23:08,170
Okay, thanks.

3014
02:23:09,173 --> 02:23:10,970
The last time I came here,

3015
02:23:11,075 --> 02:23:14,670
the roast beef you gave me
had the string still around it

3016
02:23:14,779 --> 02:23:19,478
and I was unaware of this and fed
it to my husband, and he choked.

3017
02:23:23,053 --> 02:23:24,645
How's it going, George?

3018
02:23:26,023 --> 02:23:29,515
You get a break or anything
where you can talk?

3019
02:23:29,627 --> 02:23:33,222
Okay, yeah. Sure. Chuck,
I'll be one sec, okay, man?

3020
02:23:35,099 --> 02:23:36,464
Shit.

3021
02:23:48,813 --> 02:23:51,304
So, you had to get
your job back here, huh?

3022
02:23:52,950 --> 02:23:57,011
Yeah. You know, I figured I
could use a little job stability.

3023
02:23:57,555 --> 02:23:59,318
Oh, I'm sorry.

3024
02:23:59,590 --> 02:24:02,923
I get health insurance.
It's pretty good.

3025
02:24:03,594 --> 02:24:09,863
So, I thought a lot about
what you said in the car to me.

3026
02:24:10,835 --> 02:24:14,532
A few of those things
might have been accurate.

3027
02:24:15,439 --> 02:24:19,273
You tried to help me and I'm sorry I
put you in the middle of all that stuff.

3028
02:24:19,910 --> 02:24:22,674
I'm better
in my body.

3029
02:24:22,780 --> 02:24:26,511
My brain has a ways
to go, though.

3030
02:24:28,719 --> 02:24:31,313
How are you doing, though?
You're doing okay?

3031
02:24:35,192 --> 02:24:36,659
I don't know, Ira.

3032
02:24:41,198 --> 02:24:42,165
I...

3033
02:24:42,800 --> 02:24:46,167
I caught your whole set
the other night, Ira. Nice.

3034
02:24:46,837 --> 02:24:48,498
Yeah, yeah, no,
you're getting a rhythm.

3035
02:24:48,606 --> 02:24:52,702
You're starting to be the Ira
I like in real life onstage.

3036
02:24:52,810 --> 02:24:55,506
Thanks. Yeah, I've been getting up
a lot lately, so it's going well.

3037
02:24:55,613 --> 02:24:58,707
Yeah, you were funny,
and it was a fart-free set.

3038
02:24:59,083 --> 02:25:02,985
I wrote some stuff down that
night that... Some jokes.

3039
02:25:03,087 --> 02:25:04,850
You want to hear it?

3040
02:25:04,955 --> 02:25:06,650
You what?

3041
02:25:06,757 --> 02:25:10,022
I couldn't stop thinking of jokes
for you last night. It was bizarre.

3042
02:25:10,728 --> 02:25:13,720
I'm not saying they're
good jokes, but I try.

3043
02:25:15,733 --> 02:25:17,132
You actually
wrote them down!

3044
02:25:17,234 --> 02:25:19,828
Yeah, yeah, yeah. My
fucking memory's horrible.

3045
02:25:20,537 --> 02:25:24,473
That thing you did about the
Wii Fit thing. What's that?

3046
02:25:24,608 --> 02:25:26,542
Oh, like, "My video game... " Yeah.

3047
02:25:26,644 --> 02:25:28,407
"My video game
told me I'm fat?"

3048
02:25:28,512 --> 02:25:30,309
Yeah, yeah, yeah. "The
ultimate betrayal. " Yeah.

3049
02:25:30,414 --> 02:25:35,010
Right, right. You could maybe say, "I mean,
that's like my pot telling me I'm lazy. "

3050
02:25:35,185 --> 02:25:36,345
Oh, that's really funny.

3051
02:25:36,453 --> 02:25:38,421
"And the Wii is similar
to my grandmother.

3052
02:25:38,522 --> 02:25:40,319
"She used to tell me
I'm getting chubby

3053
02:25:40,424 --> 02:25:43,450
"and then bring me chicken parmesan
and say, 'Why are you so fat?'"

3054
02:25:44,728 --> 02:25:45,888
That's really funny!

3055
02:25:45,996 --> 02:25:49,124
It's true. The video game made me
fat and... It is like my grandmother.

3056
02:25:49,233 --> 02:25:50,257
All right.
"Why are you so fat?

3057
02:25:50,367 --> 02:25:52,130
"Here's four gallons
of chocolate milk. "

3058
02:25:52,236 --> 02:25:53,703
That's good!
She would always do that.

3059
02:25:53,804 --> 02:25:55,669
That's good. I got one
I've been afraid to tell,

3060
02:25:55,773 --> 02:25:59,573
kind of, about, like, Viagra. It's
like, "My grandfather takes Viagra

3061
02:25:59,677 --> 02:26:02,612
"and he thought he was
tittie-fucking my grandmother... "

3062
02:26:02,713 --> 02:26:04,203
Yeah? "But then he realized
he was tittie-fucking

3063
02:26:04,315 --> 02:26:05,282
"his own balls. "

3064
02:26:07,284 --> 02:26:08,581
That's funny!
You got to do that!

3065
02:26:08,686 --> 02:26:09,948
That's pretty funny, huh?

3066
02:26:10,054 --> 02:26:12,716
You got to say that the thing...
That when you're that old

3067
02:26:12,823 --> 02:26:15,257
and you have a boner that there's
not a good position, you know?

3068
02:26:15,359 --> 02:26:16,519
That's funny!
That's really...

3069
02:26:16,627 --> 02:26:18,151
You do it doggy-style,
your knees hurt.

3070
02:26:18,262 --> 02:26:20,127
You get water
on your knee.

3071
02:26:20,230 --> 02:26:21,993
"I can't even hold
myself up in... " Exactly.

3072
02:26:22,099 --> 02:26:23,964
"What would an old man do?" Yeah...

3073
02:28:36,433 --> 02:28:38,060
<i>Let's do
another bad one then</i>

3074
02:28:38,168 --> 02:28:41,763
<i>'cause I like it when the
blood drains from David's face.</i>

3075
02:30:39,456 --> 02:30:40,423
<i>Okay.</i>

3076
02:31:08,385 --> 02:31:14,756
<i>Burnt-out ends
of smoky days</i>

3077
02:31:14,858 --> 02:31:20,626
<i>The stale cold smell
of morning</i>

3078
02:31:22,165 --> 02:31:28,468
<i>The streetlamp dies,
another night is over</i>

3079
02:31:29,139 --> 02:31:34,771
<i>Another day is dawning</i>

3080
02:31:36,546 --> 02:31:41,916
<i>Touch me
It's so easy to leave me</i>

3081
02:31:42,486 --> 02:31:48,982
<i>All alone with the memory
Of my days in the sun</i>

3082
02:31:50,360 --> 02:31:56,697
<i>If you touch me You'll
understand what happiness is</i>

3083
02:31:57,901 --> 02:32:02,361
<i>Look, a new day</i>

3084
02:32:02,472 --> 02:32:07,171
<i>has begun</i>
