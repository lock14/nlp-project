1
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:03,142
Bobby!

2
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:07,843
Bobby, are you in there with Amada?
Bobby!

3
00:03:07,843 --> 00:03:11,320
- It's Jumbo.
- I will be out in a second, Jumbo.

4
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,583
You got to come out.

5
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:17,059
There's chicks dancing naked right
in the bar, in the lobby. Unbelievable.

6
00:03:17,059 --> 00:03:18,458
- We got to go.
- What?

7
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,690
- Bob!
- We got to go.

8
00:03:20,690 --> 00:03:22,266
Oh, fuck, I forgot.

9
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,101
Bob!

10
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:27,800
Fucking animal.

11
00:03:28,975 --> 00:03:31,705
I got to ask Mr. Buzhayev
if we can take the night off.

12
00:03:31,705 --> 00:03:33,607
I love you.

13
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:38,348
I am going to run across the street.
You meet me at the car, okay?

14
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:41,746
- Okay. Go.
- Amada...

15
00:03:41,746 --> 00:03:46,153
...l am the luckiest man on the planet.
If I died right now, I'd be happy.

16
00:04:02,875 --> 00:04:05,139
Hey, Mr. Green,
thanks for hooking me up, man.

17
00:04:05,139 --> 00:04:06,710
How are you?

18
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,573
- Hey, Bobby.
- Hey.

19
00:04:08,573 --> 00:04:10,443
You got the best club in Brooklyn.

20
00:04:10,443 --> 00:04:12,642
Just wait
till I take over Manhattan, baby.

21
00:04:12,642 --> 00:04:15,811
Hey, do me a favor. Get them
a couple of drinks, all right?

22
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:35,240
Hey, baby, give me my purse.
I am meeting the family tonight.

23
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,501
I don't want Coco paying
for his shit tonight.

24
00:04:37,501 --> 00:04:40,305
Not after that little mix-up
we had last weekend, ladies.

25
00:04:40,305 --> 00:04:41,504
- All right.
- Bye.

26
00:04:41,504 --> 00:04:43,148
Bye, Amada. Good luck, girl.

27
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,858
Take it off! Take it off!

28
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:03,498
Hey, get the fuck down here!

29
00:05:03,498 --> 00:05:05,661
Hey, you! Get the fuck down!

30
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:11,567
Calm down. Let's give them space.
Good looking out, Jumbo.

31
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:13,075
No problem, Bob.

32
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,443
Oh, what the fuck?!

33
00:05:15,443 --> 00:05:17,242
- Don't strain yourself.
- You got it.

34
00:05:17,984 --> 00:05:20,646
Looks like everything's under control.
I will take my break.

35
00:05:20,646 --> 00:05:21,844
I didn't do nothing!

36
00:05:21,844 --> 00:05:24,216
You're bleeding all over the place.
Go home.

37
00:05:24,216 --> 00:05:26,483
- Freddie, take him home.
- I didn't do nothing.

38
00:05:26,483 --> 00:05:28,684
Go easy on them, Jumbo.

39
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:43,233
I am going across the street to see
the boss. Bring my car around.

40
00:05:43,233 --> 00:05:46,310
- You got it. I need you to come...
- Be right back.

41
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:56,413
Hi, Kalina. Look at you.

42
00:05:56,956 --> 00:06:00,289
You want to go with me to
the club, huh? Do a little dance?

43
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:05,386
- Hey, everybody!
- Hey, Bobby.

44
00:06:05,386 --> 00:06:08,625
- Hey, Mr. Buzhayev, how are you?
- Look, she got the watch.

45
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:12,100
Oh, yeah, it's great. I told you.
He's the best.

46
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,262
- Yeah. Yeah.
- I know deals.

47
00:06:14,262 --> 00:06:15,464
Digital.

48
00:06:15,464 --> 00:06:19,236
Yeah, it's great. Hey, listen.
I got to go do something tonight...

49
00:06:19,236 --> 00:06:22,313
...but Freddie will watch the place,
make the night drop later.

50
00:06:22,313 --> 00:06:25,246
Good. So how is my club doing?

51
00:06:25,246 --> 00:06:26,783
- Everything's fine.
- Good.

52
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,911
For me? Just this one.

53
00:06:29,911 --> 00:06:33,422
Amada tells me I put on 5 pounds
every time I come over here.

54
00:06:33,422 --> 00:06:36,255
I am telling you,
you guys are fattening me up.

55
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:38,786
- Good?
- Excellent.

56
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,424
Always. Real good. Excellent.

57
00:06:41,424 --> 00:06:43,330
Listen, Bobby...

58
00:06:44,003 --> 00:06:48,736
Next week you come by, we talk.
We talk about plans for you.

59
00:06:48,736 --> 00:06:51,138
We like what you do
at the club very much.

60
00:06:51,138 --> 00:06:53,335
- Yeah? All right.
- Yeah.

61
00:06:53,679 --> 00:06:55,146
- Good.
- Something more?

62
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,114
More? I just said I can't eat it.
I can't even eat this.

63
00:07:00,453 --> 00:07:01,977
I can't have another bite.

64
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:04,249
What are you doing to me?

65
00:07:04,249 --> 00:07:06,892
No, no, no, Amada's waiting.
I have to go.

66
00:07:06,892 --> 00:07:08,253
You're too good to me.

67
00:07:08,253 --> 00:07:10,658
Why do I deserve this?

68
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:15,301
- No, I got to go.
- Where? Where you run off to?

69
00:07:28,648 --> 00:07:30,172
It's my bike. Don't!

70
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,157
- Keep being brave, okay?
- Thank you.

71
00:07:45,157 --> 00:07:46,355
Thank you.

72
00:07:51,904 --> 00:07:54,168
- Here comes the right. Watch the right.
- Catch.

73
00:07:54,168 --> 00:07:57,104
- Keep... Keep it up. Keep the guard...
- Careful.

74
00:07:57,104 --> 00:07:59,301
- Sorry, babe. Keep...
- Joseph.

75
00:07:59,301 --> 00:08:01,140
- All right, hey. Hey.
- Joseph.

76
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:03,441
- Hey, quit fooling around.
- Did he bag it?

77
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:06,278
No, he never did. His gun jammed,
so he started crying.

78
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:07,976
That's terrible. A nine-point?

79
00:08:07,976 --> 00:08:10,622
- Joseph, come on.
- Pop's calling. Look...

80
00:08:10,622 --> 00:08:12,985
...we will go to Metropole,
cut loose a little.

81
00:08:12,985 --> 00:08:14,490
- You got it.
- Come over here.

82
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:16,252
Gotcha.

83
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:20,088
Get your picture taken.
It's your big night.

84
00:08:20,088 --> 00:08:22,325
- We took them already.
- The more, the better.

85
00:08:22,325 --> 00:08:24,561
- Get your face out there.
- Stevie, come here.

86
00:08:24,561 --> 00:08:27,001
The P.C. Will see this in the magazine,
all right?

87
00:08:27,001 --> 00:08:29,835
- All right.
- Get used to it, it's good. Come on.

88
00:08:30,376 --> 00:08:32,844
- Good.
- Thanks, chief.

89
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,404
Go over there to Mommy,
all right?

90
00:08:35,404 --> 00:08:37,412
It's almost 11.
Where's your brother?

91
00:08:37,412 --> 00:08:40,347
If he comes at all, he will come late,
Pop. You know him.

92
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,449
Baby.

93
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:46,414
There's cops all around.

94
00:08:47,527 --> 00:08:50,553
- They're all fucking drunk anyways.
- Give me some.

95
00:08:50,796 --> 00:08:54,630
- I am nervous.
- Don't be nervous. They're harmless.

96
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:57,963
Jumbo came through.
It's good, right?

97
00:08:59,138 --> 00:09:02,130
Yeah, it's good. Okay.

98
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,210
You coming?

99
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:16,855
Do we have to? I don't know if I can
fucking deal with them tonight.

100
00:09:16,855 --> 00:09:20,151
Come on, honey. It's your family.
You got to support them.

101
00:09:20,151 --> 00:09:22,055
Hey, remember
what I told you, right?

102
00:09:22,055 --> 00:09:24,890
Nobody at the club knows about
my family. Not even Jumbo.

103
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,089
I know. Baby, I won't
say anything. Come on.

104
00:09:27,089 --> 00:09:30,565
Last thing I need is anybody
thinking I am a fucking cop.

105
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:34,267
- Never happen, baby.
- I could be a cop.

106
00:09:34,267 --> 00:09:37,000
- What do you have to do?
- Oh, shit! Oh, shit.

107
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,203
Freeze. All right, spread them.
Spread them. Move!

108
00:09:41,203 --> 00:09:43,041
- Get him! Get him!
- Arrest her.

109
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:46,116
- Where you going?
- Just kidding, officers.

110
00:09:46,116 --> 00:09:49,049
He must know someone
because I am talking about...

111
00:09:49,049 --> 00:09:50,882
Shit. Oh, shit, look at this.

112
00:09:50,882 --> 00:09:53,890
Bobby. Bobby Grusinsky.
Is that you?

113
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:56,790
It's me, Russ De Keifer
from across Union Turnpike.

114
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:58,191
- How you doing?
- All right.

115
00:09:58,191 --> 00:10:01,299
- Still bartending at that Russian joint?
- I am managing it now.

116
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:02,991
Hey, listen to you.

117
00:10:02,991 --> 00:10:05,933
- Did he just call you "Grusinsky"?
- I will talk to you later.

118
00:10:05,933 --> 00:10:07,094
That guy's funny.

119
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:11,807
Oh, my God.

120
00:10:16,015 --> 00:10:17,880
That's them.
In the corner down there.

121
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,354
Hey, Pop.

122
00:10:26,826 --> 00:10:30,091
They don't look that bad,
though, for cops.

123
00:10:31,697 --> 00:10:33,358
All right, let's go.

124
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,628
- He's got company.
- Give me a break.

125
00:10:39,038 --> 00:10:42,030
- Here comes trouble.
- Look at you.

126
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:44,540
- You came.
- Congratulations, you're moving up.

127
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:47,679
Mr. Big Shot honors us
with his presence.

128
00:10:48,447 --> 00:10:50,381
- At your service. You look great.
- Thanks.

129
00:10:50,381 --> 00:10:52,380
Everybody,
this is my girlfriend, Amada.

130
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,314
- That's my father...
- Nice to meet you.

131
00:10:54,314 --> 00:10:55,954
...Chief Burt Grusinsky.

132
00:10:55,954 --> 00:10:57,919
- My brother, Joe.
- Hi.

133
00:10:57,919 --> 00:10:59,580
That's Michael and Jack.

134
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,283
You guys look good.

135
00:11:01,283 --> 00:11:05,760
- You put up with this guy?
- I am a Leo. I can put up with anything.

136
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:09,632
If you got a minute,
we'd like to talk to you.

137
00:11:09,632 --> 00:11:12,236
- Let's get a drink first.
- No, right now. Right now.

138
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:14,172
It's only going to take a minute.

139
00:11:14,172 --> 00:11:16,240
- Upstairs in the church.
- "Right now."

140
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,899
Come on.

141
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:20,272
Don't worry. We will bring him back
in one piece.

142
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,181
That's a great crowd
you got down there, Joe.

143
00:11:30,181 --> 00:11:34,190
- You know all the right people.
- That's a nice suit you got, Bobby.

144
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,052
Was that funny?

145
00:11:36,052 --> 00:11:38,992
I didn't know you had a sense
of humor, Michael. I like it.

146
00:11:38,992 --> 00:11:41,963
How much did that earring
set you back?

147
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,029
- What?
- You heard what I said.

148
00:11:45,029 --> 00:11:47,570
Bobby, I asked Pop
to bring you up here.

149
00:11:48,407 --> 00:11:52,207
- Bobby. Please, I am serious.
- Why? What's the matter?

150
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,146
I will be heading up this new
narcotics team starting this week.

151
00:11:56,146 --> 00:11:58,909
Russian unit
out of PSA-One in Brighton.

152
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,043
What?

153
00:12:02,043 --> 00:12:04,121
You brought me up here
to tell me that?

154
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,329
Do any of you fucking guys talk?

155
00:12:11,329 --> 00:12:14,762
- You ever say anything back there?
- I am old-fashioned. I listen first.

156
00:12:15,134 --> 00:12:17,602
Oh, God. Excuse me.

157
00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:19,829
We're looking at this guy,
Vadim Nezhinski.

158
00:12:21,006 --> 00:12:23,770
Served time in the Soviet Union
for black-market activity...

159
00:12:23,770 --> 00:12:28,903
...come over in 1979.
He's dealing H, cocaine, angel dust.

160
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:32,674
This guy's bringing in major weight
and we need to track it.

161
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:37,082
He's operating out of that spot
you manage, the El Caribe.

162
00:12:38,424 --> 00:12:40,858
Oh, I don't know nothing
about that. I am not...

163
00:12:40,858 --> 00:12:43,722
No, we know. We checked
the rest of the management too...

164
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:46,456
...his uncle, the owner.
- The old man?

165
00:12:46,456 --> 00:12:49,795
- Well, he is his uncle.
- You been fucking watching me too?

166
00:12:49,795 --> 00:12:54,167
Everybody else came up clean.
It's just Nezhinski we're looking at.

167
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,905
You want me to inform?

168
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:00,569
No.

169
00:13:00,569 --> 00:13:03,271
- Are you kidding me?
- Just observe, that's all.

170
00:13:03,271 --> 00:13:06,316
It's a closed community.
You're our only way in right now.

171
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:10,055
Great. You guys are the fucking cops.
Why are you coming to me?

172
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,019
Why...? Why is this my problem?

173
00:13:13,225 --> 00:13:17,127
The whole city's falling apart. Don't
you have any sense of responsibility?

174
00:13:17,596 --> 00:13:19,325
Let me think.

175
00:13:19,325 --> 00:13:22,626
No. No, not really. I don't.
I got enough fucking problems, Joe.

176
00:13:22,626 --> 00:13:24,702
The streets are
in fucking chaos, Bobby.

177
00:13:24,702 --> 00:13:27,703
- Our guys are dropping like flies.
- Joseph, come on. I...

178
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:32,071
Joseph, you go downstairs.
Let me talk to him, all right?

179
00:13:32,071 --> 00:13:35,042
- Yeah, thanks for coming.
- It's always a pleasure. Thank you.

180
00:13:35,042 --> 00:13:37,682
You better be careful out there
the next couple weeks.

181
00:13:37,682 --> 00:13:39,477
- What's that mean?
- You know.

182
00:13:39,477 --> 00:13:42,746
- Joseph.
- Fine, Pop. You fucking deal with him.

183
00:13:45,591 --> 00:13:48,560
- Take care, Bobby.
- Yeah.

184
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:53,364
Move over. Move over.

185
00:13:56,535 --> 00:13:59,527
Been a long time
since we have seen you.

186
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,206
Your brother says you don't
answer the phone anymore.

187
00:14:02,206 --> 00:14:04,274
I have been busy, Pop.
That's all.

188
00:14:04,274 --> 00:14:06,035
Yeah?

189
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,708
What's going on with you?

190
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:13,413
You can't talk?

191
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,451
I don't know.

192
00:14:15,451 --> 00:14:17,486
You what?

193
00:14:17,486 --> 00:14:19,248
Things are all right.

194
00:14:19,248 --> 00:14:21,393
- You're all right?
- Yeah.

195
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:22,720
Yeah?

196
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,888
You know, I could have gotten you
a good job with us, a safe job.

197
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:30,460
If you would have asked.
If you'd been around.

198
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:33,803
I got a job. I got a job. A good job.

199
00:14:33,803 --> 00:14:36,908
That's the whole point
of this conversation we had.

200
00:14:36,908 --> 00:14:40,204
That's why your brother was here,
because of this club.

201
00:14:46,285 --> 00:14:49,652
Your brother says that you have been
using your mother's name these days.

202
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,813
Yeah, just for the business.
You know, it's easy.

203
00:14:52,813 --> 00:14:55,290
"Bobby Green"?

204
00:14:55,290 --> 00:14:58,294
Well, people can pronounce it,
you know?

205
00:14:58,294 --> 00:15:01,797
That Puerto Rican you brought.
She been hooking you up?

206
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:05,998
- What do you mean?
- Come on, I can smell it on you.

207
00:15:05,998 --> 00:15:08,071
You keep laughing.

208
00:15:08,071 --> 00:15:11,641
Your mother, rest in peace,
I think she was too easy on you.

209
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,541
All right.

210
00:15:18,217 --> 00:15:20,344
I got to go, Pop.

211
00:15:20,344 --> 00:15:23,647
Bobby, let me tell you something.

212
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:28,282
Sooner or later,
either you're going to be with us...

213
00:15:28,282 --> 00:15:31,224
...or you're going to be
with the drug dealers.

214
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:33,288
This is like a war out there.

215
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,761
Now, do you understand that?

216
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,464
Do you?

217
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:45,740
I will see you.

218
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:48,175
Careful.

219
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:06,524
It's getting late. How are
the kids doing? They tired yet?

220
00:16:06,524 --> 00:16:10,032
They're always tired. They worry
about you when you're out at night.

221
00:16:10,032 --> 00:16:12,261
- Baby, sit up straight.
- Baby, do me a favor.

222
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:14,167
Don't start, all right?

223
00:16:14,707 --> 00:16:17,267
Excuse me, everybody.
Can I have your attention, please?

224
00:16:19,712 --> 00:16:22,840
Hi, my name is Deputy Commissioner
Spiro Giavannis...

225
00:16:22,840 --> 00:16:26,507
...and we're here this holiday season
to honor one of our new leaders...

226
00:16:26,507 --> 00:16:27,777
Let's get out of here...

227
00:16:27,777 --> 00:16:29,887
...and go party with Jumbo.
- Why?

228
00:16:29,887 --> 00:16:33,388
Baby, your family don't like me,
I don't care. I am here for you, okay?

229
00:16:33,388 --> 00:16:35,186
Fuck them. Let's go. It's boring.

230
00:16:35,186 --> 00:16:37,022
- They're stiffs. Yeah.
- Really?

231
00:16:37,022 --> 00:16:39,494
I am sure the chief would like
to say a few words.

232
00:16:39,494 --> 00:16:42,225
So I'd like to bring him
up here now. Chief?

233
00:16:47,740 --> 00:16:49,605
Thank you. Thank you very much.

234
00:16:49,605 --> 00:16:51,299
Yeah, chief.

235
00:16:51,299 --> 00:16:54,913
You know, I used to tell my kids,
"Work first, play later."

236
00:16:54,913 --> 00:16:58,243
And my son Joseph
really took that to heart.

237
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:02,612
Been a real fighter over the years.
He overcome the dyslexia...

238
00:17:02,612 --> 00:17:06,815
...and eventually wound up
graduating John Jay as salutatorian.

239
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,716
And hey...

240
00:17:08,716 --> 00:17:12,022
I am very proud here tonight.

241
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:26,535
I want to thank you all for coming.
Happy Thanksgiving.

242
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:29,142
Before I say anything else...

243
00:17:29,142 --> 00:17:32,374
...one of our brothers was killed
in the line of duty last night.

244
00:17:33,285 --> 00:17:34,946
Edward Conlon was gunned down...

245
00:17:34,946 --> 00:17:37,452
...serving a warrant
on Northern Boulevard.

246
00:17:37,452 --> 00:17:39,318
Hey. Come here.

247
00:17:39,318 --> 00:17:42,085
The clock is about to strike 11.

248
00:17:42,528 --> 00:17:46,225
I thought we might be able to give
a moment of silence to remember.

249
00:18:32,811 --> 00:18:35,279
- Come on, get over here.
- Which one?

250
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,716
Come on, I am meeting with Buzhayev
tonight. Which one? This one?

251
00:18:38,716 --> 00:18:40,977
That one. Hey, baby.

252
00:18:40,977 --> 00:18:42,882
- I got good news.
- Yeah?

253
00:18:42,882 --> 00:18:46,183
So I talked to my mom yesterday.
She's feeling better.

254
00:18:46,183 --> 00:18:49,327
So I can move in whenever I want.

255
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:53,023
Really?

256
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:56,226
- Don't joke with me.
- I am not.

257
00:18:56,226 --> 00:18:59,837
I like it. I like it.

258
00:19:00,205 --> 00:19:03,572
It's official. You get your side
of the bed, I get mine.

259
00:19:04,243 --> 00:19:06,541
Seriously, it's great news.

260
00:19:06,541 --> 00:19:10,011
- Hey, I got you something.
- What?

261
00:19:10,011 --> 00:19:13,208
You have been working so hard lately.

262
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:19,617
- What is it?
- Open it up.

263
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:21,986
- Now?
- Go ahead, open it.

264
00:19:32,171 --> 00:19:33,536
It's nice.

265
00:19:34,239 --> 00:19:36,002
I like it.

266
00:19:36,675 --> 00:19:37,835
Thank you.

267
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:41,908
- I love you so much.
- I love you too, babe.

268
00:19:42,581 --> 00:19:44,811
We will have a lot of kids...

269
00:19:44,811 --> 00:19:47,884
...big house.
- Yeah?

270
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:52,584
Can we get big kids
and a lot of houses?

271
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,018
Hey, Bobby! Get your ass out here.

272
00:19:55,018 --> 00:19:58,630
It's probably Jumbo. Come on, let's
go hang out with them for a minute.

273
00:19:58,630 --> 00:20:01,288
Everybody, the life of the party
is here.

274
00:20:01,288 --> 00:20:03,229
Hey, Falsetti,
you get what we wanted?

275
00:20:03,229 --> 00:20:06,200
Absolutely. I got a little of
what everybody asked for here.

276
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:10,307
I got uppers, I got downers.
Hash, mescaline, some blow.

277
00:20:10,307 --> 00:20:13,501
The troops require sustenance.

278
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,712
<i>Go, go, go!</i>

279
00:20:53,518 --> 00:20:55,782
You got to get dressed.
You got to get dressed.

280
00:20:55,782 --> 00:20:57,819
Come on, get dressed.

281
00:20:57,819 --> 00:21:00,525
You can't be late
for the boss, baby.

282
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:12,033
- Bobby!
- Well, hello, how are you?

283
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:15,838
I thought you could ride. Not riding
so good. You don't ride bareback?

284
00:21:15,838 --> 00:21:17,737
How are you?

285
00:21:18,477 --> 00:21:19,967
- Bobby.
- You wouldn't believe it.

286
00:21:19,967 --> 00:21:25,048
It's 40 degrees out, line's halfway
around the block. It's unbelievable.

287
00:21:26,018 --> 00:21:27,986
I will grab something in a second,
thank you.

288
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:32,948
Take kids in the other room.

289
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:37,689
Don't worry, kids.

290
00:21:37,689 --> 00:21:41,321
You will see Grandpa on Tuesday
to ride the horses.

291
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:43,466
Not on the furs!

292
00:21:44,002 --> 00:21:45,162
- Bobby.
- Pop.

293
00:21:45,162 --> 00:21:47,134
- Have a seat.
- Why? What'd I miss?

294
00:21:47,134 --> 00:21:49,399
Listen, we're thinking
about expanding.

295
00:21:49,908 --> 00:21:53,639
Maybe we will open another spot
next year across from Brighton.

296
00:21:53,639 --> 00:21:55,575
- I like it.
- Yeah, good.

297
00:21:55,575 --> 00:21:59,547
And we think you will run it
and we will do it exactly like here.

298
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:01,282
- Could be good.
- Good?

299
00:22:01,282 --> 00:22:03,921
Good, yeah. Listen...

300
00:22:03,921 --> 00:22:07,490
...l have been thinking. If you want to
open another spot, I mean...

301
00:22:07,490 --> 00:22:10,856
...why not try Manhattan?
- Manhattan's very expensive.

302
00:22:10,856 --> 00:22:12,223
Depends on where you go.

303
00:22:12,223 --> 00:22:14,991
I mean, you get in there now,
get something for cheap.

304
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:17,397
I am talking a big space,
a big warehouse.

305
00:22:17,397 --> 00:22:19,127
You get different levels going.

306
00:22:19,127 --> 00:22:21,465
We could do something different
on each floor.

307
00:22:21,465 --> 00:22:23,403
Like one floor could be rock 'n' roll.

308
00:22:23,403 --> 00:22:26,669
Then you do another floor,
you got disco. Something like that.

309
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:30,646
He's got so many ideas!

310
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:35,145
And don't let your hair-brained
nephew Vadim screw it up!

311
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,515
It's a lot of money, Papa.

312
00:22:37,515 --> 00:22:41,420
Your fur business can
support that right now?

313
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:45,052
My son-in-law, he worries people
take advantage of me.

314
00:22:45,052 --> 00:22:46,219
I understand that.

315
00:22:46,219 --> 00:22:48,889
But I think we can do something
special and different.

316
00:22:48,889 --> 00:22:51,228
Worst-case scenario,
it's a great investment.

317
00:22:51,228 --> 00:22:53,769
I mean, I think it's worth looking into.

318
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,341
All right.

319
00:22:56,341 --> 00:22:59,568
So bring some details.
We will figure out the numbers.

320
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:01,444
- Yeah?
- Okay?

321
00:23:01,444 --> 00:23:03,046
Good.

322
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:05,209
I love you.

323
00:23:14,426 --> 00:23:15,859
Hey, who is this?

324
00:23:15,859 --> 00:23:19,554
You are in the presence
of the future king of New York.

325
00:23:19,554 --> 00:23:21,756
The future king?
What are you talking about?

326
00:23:21,756 --> 00:23:24,458
Listen, nothing's definite
so don't say anything.

327
00:23:24,458 --> 00:23:26,069
I was just with Mr. Buzhayev.

328
00:23:26,069 --> 00:23:28,763
He's talking about opening
another spot in Manhattan.

329
00:23:28,763 --> 00:23:33,400
He wants me to run it.
I want you, my brother, to be a host.

330
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:36,638
Of course! I am a people person.
That's my specialty.

331
00:23:36,638 --> 00:23:38,976
- I know.
- My fucking man.

332
00:23:38,976 --> 00:23:40,982
I am the "hoster" with the "moster."

333
00:23:40,982 --> 00:23:44,020
That's beautiful news, Bob.
Beautiful.

334
00:23:44,456 --> 00:23:47,448
Now you will finally be getting me
all the women I deserve.

335
00:23:47,448 --> 00:23:49,321
What's Amada doing
at Vadim's table?

336
00:23:51,830 --> 00:23:55,596
She's doing what she's supposed
to do. She's charming the customers.

337
00:23:55,596 --> 00:24:00,397
- What do you hear about him, Jumbo?
- I don't know what I hear.

338
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,167
- I hear stories.
- You hear stories. Like what?

339
00:24:04,167 --> 00:24:05,673
Stories.

340
00:24:06,478 --> 00:24:10,107
Like last year, one of his guys
was going to rat him out.

341
00:24:10,107 --> 00:24:12,113
Cops found his head
on Brighton Avenue.

342
00:24:12,113 --> 00:24:16,118
- Fucking dick was in his mouth.
- Sure it wasn't your dick?

343
00:24:17,189 --> 00:24:19,589
Are you sure it wasn't your mouth?

344
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:26,886
But I tell you, he wouldn't be
running around here like a king...

345
00:24:26,886 --> 00:24:29,659
...if his uncle didn't own the place,
that much I know.

346
00:24:29,659 --> 00:24:31,029
I got to get back to work.

347
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:33,933
All right. Nice talking to you. Bye.

348
00:24:34,706 --> 00:24:36,173
I am going to go talk to Amada.

349
00:24:36,942 --> 00:24:40,378
- All right, I will see you later.
- I will be downstairs.

350
00:24:49,921 --> 00:24:52,754
I was just telling her how you
stuffed a pill up her nose.

351
00:24:52,754 --> 00:24:55,654
Yeah, that's going
on the wall of shame.

352
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,125
See you later.

353
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,364
Hey, babe, listen.

354
00:25:00,364 --> 00:25:03,228
I don't think you should be around
Vadim so much right now.

355
00:25:03,228 --> 00:25:05,301
Why? You jealous?

356
00:25:05,301 --> 00:25:08,462
No, I am not jealous. Listen,
it's nothing for you to worry about.

357
00:25:08,462 --> 00:25:09,629
Okay.

358
00:25:09,629 --> 00:25:12,072
I want to tell you about
my meeting with Buzhayev.

359
00:25:12,072 --> 00:25:13,438
This is the police!

360
00:25:13,438 --> 00:25:16,012
- This is a raid!
- Let's go.

361
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:18,839
- Police!
- Fuck.

362
00:25:19,217 --> 00:25:22,243
Let's find this motherfucker right now.
Let's go.

363
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:25,821
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

364
00:25:25,821 --> 00:25:28,323
Everybody get your hands
on your fucking heads.

365
00:25:28,323 --> 00:25:31,053
- Let go of me, man.
- Get the fuck down!

366
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:39,933
Empty your pockets!
Oh, jackpot.

367
00:25:39,933 --> 00:25:43,040
- Get on the bar. Hands on the bar.
- Who authorized this?

368
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:45,335
Tell me who authorized it.
I have the right...

369
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:47,705
What's the matter? You on
something? Come here.

370
00:25:47,705 --> 00:25:51,645
That's right. Hands on your
fucking head and don't move!

371
00:25:51,645 --> 00:25:54,148
- Hey, easy, easy.
- Toss them all, Pudge!

372
00:25:54,148 --> 00:25:57,152
- Where is he?
- Get on... Get on the fucking ground!

373
00:25:57,152 --> 00:25:59,552
Give him the charcoal.
Open your fucking mouth!

374
00:25:59,552 --> 00:26:01,191
Who the fuck authorized this?

375
00:26:01,191 --> 00:26:04,760
- I am looking for Vadim Nezhinski.
- He must be on something.

376
00:26:05,263 --> 00:26:07,424
Get the fucking charcoal.
You do a little dust?

377
00:26:07,424 --> 00:26:10,261
- Bring him the fuck down here!
- Get this piece of shit up.

378
00:26:10,261 --> 00:26:12,926
- Where is he?
- He's up here, captain! We got him.

379
00:26:12,926 --> 00:26:15,265
How about some charcoal
to absorb the toxins?

380
00:26:15,265 --> 00:26:17,533
Clear some space here
for me, ladies, please.

381
00:26:17,533 --> 00:26:19,973
- Turn him, he's going to puke.
- Where's Nezhinski?

382
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,944
- Get this piece of shit up.
- Here we go.

383
00:26:22,944 --> 00:26:25,844
- Give me some space here, please.
- Get the fuck out here.

384
00:26:25,844 --> 00:26:27,678
- Who else?
- Don't you move.

385
00:26:27,678 --> 00:26:29,080
- Turn around.
- Here we go.

386
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,848
What are you looking at?
Turn your head the other way.

387
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:40,523
Turn around.

388
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:44,835
- What is this?
- Stay down, stay down.

389
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:47,128
Tough guy, huh?

390
00:26:47,128 --> 00:26:49,273
What, you want me
to double your money?

391
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:54,468
- Stay down.
- There it is.

392
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:57,546
It's doubled. How's that?

393
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,710
What are you looking at?
Turn around.

394
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:06,320
What else you got in here, huh,
joker? What about the girls?

395
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:09,790
Come here.
You got anything in here?

396
00:27:13,431 --> 00:27:15,399
You got a cross and a Jewish star
on you.

397
00:27:15,399 --> 00:27:17,967
- What's the matter? You confused?
- Not me.

398
00:27:20,071 --> 00:27:21,595
- What we got?
- This one's holding.

399
00:27:21,595 --> 00:27:24,241
- Couple dimes of cocaine, some PCP.
- Good.

400
00:27:24,241 --> 00:27:27,469
You and you are under arrest.
Possession and sale of narcotics.

401
00:27:27,469 --> 00:27:30,046
Talk to them and
we go after your mother.

402
00:27:30,046 --> 00:27:32,740
What the fuck
did you just say to him?

403
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,045
Nothing.

404
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:40,190
Your boy's going to open up on you.
And when he does, I am coming back.

405
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,885
All right. Let's go.

406
00:27:43,885 --> 00:27:45,552
Come on!

407
00:27:46,197 --> 00:27:50,566
Good night, everybody. Pleasure
doing business with you. Wrap it up.

408
00:27:51,803 --> 00:27:52,895
Let's go.

409
00:27:53,938 --> 00:27:55,769
- Mr. Buzhayev.
- Yes?

410
00:27:55,769 --> 00:27:58,374
- I am Captain Jack Shapiro.
- Nice to meet you.

411
00:27:58,374 --> 00:28:00,135
This has nothing to do with you...

412
00:28:00,135 --> 00:28:02,836
...but do you have a nephew
named Vadim Nezhinski?

413
00:28:02,836 --> 00:28:05,608
- Yes.
- Does he have an office here?

414
00:28:05,608 --> 00:28:08,753
Clean him up. I don't want to
get it all over the car.

415
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,683
You got him dirty, you clean him up.

416
00:28:11,656 --> 00:28:13,715
- Does he have an office here?
- No.

417
00:28:13,715 --> 00:28:15,416
Okay.

418
00:28:16,327 --> 00:28:18,192
We will be in touch.

419
00:28:18,192 --> 00:28:20,297
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

420
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:26,798
- Oh, shit!
- Oh, my God!

421
00:28:26,798 --> 00:28:29,303
- How the fuck did he get out here?
- Get out!

422
00:28:29,303 --> 00:28:32,466
- What do you got?
- Possession and resisting arrest.

423
00:28:32,466 --> 00:28:34,874
He's also got $207 on him.

424
00:28:34,874 --> 00:28:37,173
- Two-oh-seven? Take him in the back.
- Let's go.

425
00:28:37,173 --> 00:28:39,873
- Who frisked this asshole?
- Don't forget the pedigree.

426
00:28:39,873 --> 00:28:42,383
- All right.
- We got to stop the bleeding.

427
00:28:42,383 --> 00:28:45,022
- What do you got?
- He's bleeding all over the place.

428
00:28:45,022 --> 00:28:47,624
- Don't touch him!
- Jesus Christ, what the fuck?

429
00:28:47,624 --> 00:28:49,885
- The Russian guy cut himself open.
- Jesus.

430
00:28:49,885 --> 00:28:52,461
- Where'd he get the blade?
- He had it on him, man.

431
00:28:53,865 --> 00:28:55,856
Hey, hey.
What the fuck is going on in here?

432
00:28:55,856 --> 00:28:58,662
- He cut his throat.
- He pulled some cutting, man.

433
00:28:58,662 --> 00:29:02,068
Put pressure on him, all right?
Put pressure.

434
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,904
Why are you standing there?
Get us a fucking bus.

435
00:29:04,904 --> 00:29:07,067
All right, all right, all right.

436
00:29:07,846 --> 00:29:09,609
Shit.

437
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:19,050
Good morning, chief.

438
00:29:24,229 --> 00:29:26,254
You ready to go home?

439
00:29:26,254 --> 00:29:28,365
Or do you have a home?

440
00:29:31,503 --> 00:29:33,368
Your brother wanted me
to let you out.

441
00:29:33,368 --> 00:29:37,167
If it was up to me, I'd let you stay here
another couple of days or a week.

442
00:29:37,167 --> 00:29:39,640
- Maybe a month.
- Do you want me to thank him?

443
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,137
Disgusting.

444
00:29:45,116 --> 00:29:47,949
You're uncontrollable. You know?

445
00:29:50,088 --> 00:29:52,215
Give him a bath.

446
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:54,988
I ought to rap you one.

447
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:07,136
Hey, sign out with the desk sergeant
before you leave, please.

448
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:13,139
Guy cut his own throat.
Nezhinski must have...

449
00:30:13,139 --> 00:30:15,677
...really put the fear of God in him.
- Look...

450
00:30:15,677 --> 00:30:18,338
...that guy knew how they're
bringing the product in.

451
00:30:18,338 --> 00:30:19,915
- Absolutely.
- That's the key.

452
00:30:19,915 --> 00:30:22,746
We find the right guy,
we're going to get him...

453
00:30:37,635 --> 00:30:41,765
We waited till it was your day off.
We had to go. I am sorry. That's it.

454
00:30:41,765 --> 00:30:44,067
You had to hit that spot.
Of all the places...

455
00:30:44,067 --> 00:30:47,507
...you got to come to my place?
- That's where Nezhinski's been seen.

456
00:30:47,507 --> 00:30:49,510
We supposed to
announce it in advance...

457
00:30:49,510 --> 00:30:52,582
...and compromise the whole thing?
I told you I am very sorry...

458
00:30:52,582 --> 00:30:56,015
Sorry's not good enough. You don't
come in, act like you own the place.

459
00:30:56,015 --> 00:30:58,087
Got your guys putting shit
down my throat!

460
00:30:58,087 --> 00:31:01,589
You want me to come in here, fuck
everything up, push everything around?

461
00:31:01,589 --> 00:31:03,852
You wouldn't be in this
if you didn't fuck around!

462
00:31:03,852 --> 00:31:07,486
No, I wouldn't be in this shit
if you weren't trying to be top cop.

463
00:31:07,486 --> 00:31:10,532
You know fucking Nezhinski's guy?
His fucking throat cut open.

464
00:31:10,532 --> 00:31:12,465
Congratulations, Captain Joe.
Good job!

465
00:31:12,465 --> 00:31:15,572
Think you're above it? You fuck
around with your Puerto Rican?

466
00:31:15,572 --> 00:31:18,868
- Grow up and act like a man...
- Try thinking about my Puerto Rican...

467
00:31:18,868 --> 00:31:21,568
...while trying to fuck your fat wife!
How's that?

468
00:31:23,448 --> 00:31:25,006
- Knock it off! Bobby!
- Get off!

469
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:27,276
- Come on!
- Get off me!

470
00:31:29,621 --> 00:31:31,282
Don't touch me! You're not Pop!

471
00:31:31,589 --> 00:31:34,888
I am done with you. I don't want to
see your fucking face anymore.

472
00:31:34,888 --> 00:31:36,993
Get out of here!

473
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,662
I am going home.

474
00:31:45,303 --> 00:31:47,498
It's a fucking holiday.

475
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:03,176
<i>Winter, spring, summer, fall...</i>

476
00:32:03,176 --> 00:32:07,848
<i>... call 966-7210 for reservations
at Pocono Gardens and...</i>

477
00:32:07,848 --> 00:32:11,689
<i>Beautiful Mount Airy Lodge.</i>

478
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:23,265
Shit.

479
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,464
<i>Jab, combination.</i>

480
00:32:50,464 --> 00:32:55,334
Come on, dig. Dig. Come on.
Dig! Dig! Dig! Combination.

481
00:32:55,334 --> 00:32:59,033
Combination. Jab. Jab. Jab.
Combination.

482
00:32:59,033 --> 00:33:01,178
Dig. Dig. Dig. With authority.

483
00:33:01,178 --> 00:33:04,679
Dig. Dig. Finish it up. With authority.

484
00:33:04,679 --> 00:33:06,840
That's it. That's it.

485
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,384
Good. Take a rest. Take a rest.

486
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,889
- Chief.
- Yeah.

487
00:33:23,668 --> 00:33:25,067
Which kid is it?

488
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:33,098
It's Joseph.
He's in Jamaica Hospital.

489
00:33:33,098 --> 00:33:36,610
It don't look good right now.

490
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,881
Want us to contact
your other son, chief?

491
00:33:39,881 --> 00:33:43,077
No, I will do that. Thanks.

492
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,216
You okay, chief?

493
00:33:45,216 --> 00:33:49,121
You guys go on.
I will be right out. Thank you.

494
00:33:56,901 --> 00:33:59,631
- Chief.
- Yo, chief. You all right?

495
00:33:59,631 --> 00:34:02,602
I am all right. I am all right.

496
00:34:03,941 --> 00:34:05,738
C-note.

497
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:15,247
Come on, man. Let's go.

498
00:34:16,521 --> 00:34:19,149
All right, tell you what, José.

499
00:34:19,149 --> 00:34:21,086
I will see you...

500
00:34:24,395 --> 00:34:26,522
...and I will bump you two C's.

501
00:34:38,276 --> 00:34:39,800
Call.

502
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:42,203
Hello.

503
00:34:42,203 --> 00:34:46,714
Ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to
introduce you to José's new friends...

504
00:34:46,714 --> 00:34:50,149
...Siegfried and Roy. Two queens.

505
00:34:51,389 --> 00:34:53,949
- Hey, Bobby.
- How you like that, huh?

506
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:57,457
- Bobby!
- What? Hang up on them.

507
00:34:57,457 --> 00:35:00,495
What you got?
Come on, you fold with that?

508
00:35:00,495 --> 00:35:03,065
- That's what...
- It's the police.

509
00:35:03,065 --> 00:35:06,260
All right, all right, deal again.
Deal again. I am feeling hot!

510
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:08,462
José, I thought you knew
how to play poker.

511
00:35:08,462 --> 00:35:10,971
I told him to keep going.
He was going to pack it in.

512
00:35:10,971 --> 00:35:13,269
Go fuck yourself
and just deal the cards.

513
00:35:13,269 --> 00:35:15,139
<i>- Hello.
- Bobby?</i>

514
00:35:15,139 --> 00:35:16,905
Yeah.

515
00:35:16,905 --> 00:35:19,879
<i>Bobby, it's Michael Solo.
I got some bad news.</i>

516
00:35:19,879 --> 00:35:22,713
<i>It's your brother.
Your brother's been shot.</i>

517
00:35:22,713 --> 00:35:26,186
<i>About an hour ago,
outside his house.</i>

518
00:35:26,186 --> 00:35:27,381
What? Who?

519
00:35:27,381 --> 00:35:30,959
<i>Can you hear me? Your brother's
been shot. He's at Jamaica Hospital.</i>

520
00:35:30,959 --> 00:35:32,756
<i>They're working on him now.</i>

521
00:35:32,756 --> 00:35:35,160
What are you talking about?
I was just with him.

522
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,233
<i>Listen, your father's coming.
I got to go.</i>

523
00:35:37,233 --> 00:35:41,201
<i>But he's at Jamaica.
I just thought you should know.</i>

524
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:45,232
What happened?

525
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:51,041
- My brother was shot.
- Oh, my God.

526
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:56,685
They're operating on him...

527
00:35:56,685 --> 00:35:59,015
They're operating on him right now.
I got to...

528
00:35:59,015 --> 00:36:00,748
Bobby.

529
00:36:00,748 --> 00:36:03,894
- Where are my keys?
- They should be on your desk.

530
00:36:04,428 --> 00:36:07,420
- I will get my coat. I will go with you.
- No. No.

531
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:09,657
Stay here tonight.
I will call you later.

532
00:36:09,657 --> 00:36:13,634
- Bobby, I want to go with you.
- No. I will call later.

533
00:36:14,972 --> 00:36:16,633
Bobkes?

534
00:36:16,633 --> 00:36:20,106
- Where you going?
- Deal the cards, man.

535
00:36:33,324 --> 00:36:36,657
Pop, Joe going to be all right?

536
00:36:37,662 --> 00:36:39,129
He's all right?

537
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:42,932
You got into a fight with him,
I heard.

538
00:36:44,001 --> 00:36:47,698
- No.
- Well, you got what you wanted...

539
00:36:47,698 --> 00:36:50,067
...and you stayed out of it.

540
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:52,174
- Burt.
- Why would you say that?

541
00:36:52,174 --> 00:36:55,278
- The union sent a shrink over for you.
- I don't need that crap.

542
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:57,409
- Your Honor.
- Chief.

543
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,643
- Chief, I am sorry.
- What happened, Michael? Tell me.

544
00:37:01,643 --> 00:37:03,650
- What's going on?
- I am glad you're here.

545
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:05,755
First, I want to tell you
how sorry I am.

546
00:37:06,424 --> 00:37:09,689
We will get them, Your Honor.
I will come back in and run it myself.

547
00:37:09,689 --> 00:37:12,192
The bullet went into his cheek,
came out his jaw.

548
00:37:12,192 --> 00:37:14,228
- It missed his brain, thank God.
- Jesus.

549
00:37:14,228 --> 00:37:15,922
He's very lucky, considering.

550
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:18,161
Do you know who did it?

551
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:20,053
No.

552
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:23,669
Definitely a professional.
They bombed his car.

553
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:27,643
It's a calling card.
We think it's the Russians.

554
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:32,679
You know, it's a real shame
we didn't get to Nezhinski before this.

555
00:37:34,952 --> 00:37:36,681
Are you fucking blaming me?

556
00:37:38,556 --> 00:37:39,306
No.

557
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:43,822
But I am not the only one
around here with an opinion.

558
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:50,795
Best-case scenario...

559
00:37:50,795 --> 00:37:55,234
...doctor says your brother will have to
be here for at least a couple months.

560
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,134
Anyway...

561
00:37:57,341 --> 00:38:00,333
...let's just...
Let's just hope he pulls through.

562
00:38:00,333 --> 00:38:02,479
I am going to see him.

563
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:09,442
- Easy.
- Nobody's allowed in...

564
00:38:09,442 --> 00:38:11,713
...except immediate family.
- I am his brother.

565
00:38:11,713 --> 00:38:13,288
I am his fucking brother!

566
00:38:13,288 --> 00:38:15,550
Officers, hold on!
Let him in. It's all right.

567
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:18,524
- His nametag says "Green."
- It's his brother.

568
00:38:18,524 --> 00:38:20,425
Okay, boss.

569
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:29,689
I am sorry, Joe.

570
00:40:32,463 --> 00:40:36,126
This guy got two queens
and he bumps the guy $200?

571
00:40:36,126 --> 00:40:40,100
And then he wins and where the fuck
do you run off to, like a Jew, huh?

572
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,102
The place went fucking bananas.

573
00:40:42,102 --> 00:40:45,538
I got to straighten things out. I had
to bust some heads like Bruce Lee.

574
00:40:45,538 --> 00:40:47,700
I am in there busting fucking heads.
They...

575
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,312
All right, Jumbo?
Jumbo, do me a favor.

576
00:40:50,312 --> 00:40:53,177
Would you grab the check?
Let's get out of here. I am tired.

577
00:40:53,177 --> 00:40:56,046
All right, fine. I will go pay the check.

578
00:40:56,046 --> 00:40:59,986
But, Bob, just don't forget that nobody
could ever do for you what I did.

579
00:40:59,986 --> 00:41:02,421
Busting heads.

580
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:05,585
Hey, don't say nothing to Jumbo
about what happened, all right?

581
00:41:05,585 --> 00:41:08,994
Of course. I just thought he could
cheer you up a little, that's all.

582
00:41:08,994 --> 00:41:11,031
- Thanks.
- Look who's here.

583
00:41:13,003 --> 00:41:14,561
- Hi, Vadim.
- Hey.

584
00:41:14,561 --> 00:41:16,763
We were just about to leave.

585
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,667
- How you doing?
- I am all right.

586
00:41:21,345 --> 00:41:23,074
Made it through the bust okay?

587
00:41:23,074 --> 00:41:26,978
- I am here.
- Good. Good. Glad to hear it.

588
00:41:28,452 --> 00:41:30,647
Your uncle's got some
trouble now, though.

589
00:41:30,647 --> 00:41:32,880
You fucked up the club.

590
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:36,392
He does what he's got to do,
I do what I got to do.

591
00:41:36,392 --> 00:41:38,323
He don't own me.

592
00:41:38,323 --> 00:41:41,363
He's got grandkids to worry about,
chasing them around.

593
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:52,408
Hey, baby, go keep Jumbo company
for a sec, all right?

594
00:41:53,944 --> 00:41:55,673
Nice girl you got there.

595
00:41:55,673 --> 00:41:58,406
One is prettier than the other.
He knows everybody.

596
00:41:58,406 --> 00:42:00,015
He's pretty popular.

597
00:42:00,818 --> 00:42:05,312
You must know a whole network
of people. Clubs, everything, huh?

598
00:42:05,990 --> 00:42:08,049
Listen...

599
00:42:09,159 --> 00:42:11,559
...I got some shit coming in.

600
00:42:11,996 --> 00:42:14,988
And some of us think maybe
you could help us get it out there.

601
00:42:15,432 --> 00:42:17,764
My product needs a reputation.

602
00:42:17,764 --> 00:42:20,130
A little dangerous right now,
don't you think?

603
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:23,539
We got a lot of muscle behind this.

604
00:42:25,009 --> 00:42:27,603
- Muscle?
- Yeah, that's right.

605
00:42:28,145 --> 00:42:30,511
You know a cop got hit today?

606
00:42:30,915 --> 00:42:33,475
Do you think
that was a coincidence?

607
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:40,955
Well, they're not going to
sit still for that, you know?

608
00:42:41,258 --> 00:42:43,123
Police are a fucking joke, dude.

609
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:45,720
Mickey Mouse ain't going to
do nothing.

610
00:42:46,997 --> 00:42:49,898
Cop got lucky. He zigged
when he should have zagged.

611
00:42:49,898 --> 00:42:51,830
You sit with them.

612
00:42:58,509 --> 00:43:00,033
Bobby.

613
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,708
The cops...

614
00:43:02,708 --> 00:43:04,575
...they ain't no problem.

615
00:43:04,575 --> 00:43:07,239
So don't worry about it.
We will get them all.

616
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:11,320
You cut the head off, the body will fall.
Am I right?

617
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:15,051
We do it until they get the message.

618
00:43:15,559 --> 00:43:19,086
We just heard that cop's father
is going to be in charge now.

619
00:43:19,086 --> 00:43:21,094
We will get him too.

620
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:26,594
We got all their names on a list.

621
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:30,566
The chief of police will be next.

622
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:35,305
If you change your mind, call Pavel.

623
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,777
I got a great product.

624
00:43:37,777 --> 00:43:40,416
Why don't you come down
and check it out for yourself?

625
00:43:40,416 --> 00:43:42,108
All right.

626
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,189
Well, you're wrong, chief.

627
00:43:52,189 --> 00:43:54,331
We got to make a move.
We got to make it now.

628
00:43:54,331 --> 00:43:57,626
- No! We don't go nuts.
- You heard what Bobby just said.

629
00:43:57,626 --> 00:44:00,167
Nezhinski's got a contract
out on us, Burt.

630
00:44:00,167 --> 00:44:03,397
I know that. You want to
take over my department?

631
00:44:03,397 --> 00:44:05,337
You want to run it?
What do you want to do?

632
00:44:05,337 --> 00:44:07,670
- I want an answer from you.
- Answer for what?

633
00:44:07,670 --> 00:44:12,043
I have no answers now.
We're looking for him, all right?

634
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:16,410
Use your head. If we go arrest them,
they'd be back on the street in a day.

635
00:44:16,410 --> 00:44:18,748
We got to catch them
with their hands full...

636
00:44:18,748 --> 00:44:21,982
...find out where they got the real
weight, then we make the move.

637
00:44:21,982 --> 00:44:25,094
- We don't have that much time.
- Doesn't matter. It's the right play.

638
00:44:25,094 --> 00:44:26,593
- I say we hit them all.
- What?

639
00:44:26,593 --> 00:44:29,858
- Wipe them out. No survivors.
- Don't be a first-class schmuck.

640
00:44:29,858 --> 00:44:33,299
- We don't have the time to infiltrate.
- That is exactly my point.

641
00:44:33,299 --> 00:44:35,028
Then we make the time.

642
00:44:35,028 --> 00:44:37,435
- At whose expense?
- Hold on!

643
00:44:37,435 --> 00:44:39,974
I want you all
to understand something, all right?

644
00:44:39,974 --> 00:44:43,272
We don't ever play in the dirt here.
Not ever, no matter what.

645
00:44:43,847 --> 00:44:47,339
When you piss in your pants,
you can only stay warm for so long.

646
00:44:50,654 --> 00:44:51,882
Bobby.

647
00:44:51,882 --> 00:44:54,957
Is there anything else you know
or anything you can tell us?

648
00:44:57,094 --> 00:44:59,289
Nezhinski come in and...

649
00:44:59,697 --> 00:45:02,825
...he was saying they're trying
to create a brand name, that they...

650
00:45:02,825 --> 00:45:04,991
...want to corner the market.

651
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:07,328
Why did he tell you this?

652
00:45:08,238 --> 00:45:12,197
I don't know. He thought
I could help him build a reputation.

653
00:45:12,443 --> 00:45:14,206
Nice friends you got there.

654
00:45:14,206 --> 00:45:17,370
Know what, Pop? He's not my friend.
All right? He came at me.

655
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:18,905
All right.

656
00:45:18,905 --> 00:45:21,381
I am not interested in that.
I don't deal.

657
00:45:21,381 --> 00:45:23,019
But didn't you lead him on?

658
00:45:23,019 --> 00:45:25,212
No, I didn't fucking lead him on.

659
00:45:25,212 --> 00:45:29,155
The guy's crazy. He told me
I could come look at his operation.

660
00:45:29,155 --> 00:45:31,794
- I didn't even ask.
- He talked about his operation?

661
00:45:32,763 --> 00:45:34,594
Maybe that's it. Maybe that's key.

662
00:45:34,594 --> 00:45:36,665
What's your point?

663
00:45:36,665 --> 00:45:39,428
We put a Kel on him.
Then send one of our uncles in.

664
00:45:39,428 --> 00:45:41,935
Wait a minute. Wait.
Who's going to be the tail?

665
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:46,436
No, forget about it. No way.
No. Forget it. Forget it!

666
00:45:46,436 --> 00:45:49,272
You go to his spot, right?
And you let him talk.

667
00:45:49,272 --> 00:45:51,277
You let him hang himself.

668
00:45:51,277 --> 00:45:54,008
And then we trail you,
you know, to the location.

669
00:45:54,008 --> 00:45:55,845
A week later, we pop him.

670
00:45:55,845 --> 00:45:58,249
And your name's cleared.
Nobody knows it's you.

671
00:45:58,249 --> 00:46:01,118
Mike, it's too dangerous for him.
He's my son.

672
00:46:01,118 --> 00:46:04,556
- He's connected to all of us.
- No one knows I am connected to you.

673
00:46:04,556 --> 00:46:08,061
- What?
- I don't talk about you.

674
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,492
What about your girlfriend?
She knows about you, right?

675
00:46:15,405 --> 00:46:16,770
Yeah.

676
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:21,333
All right, leave me alone
a minute. Okay?

677
00:46:22,546 --> 00:46:27,711
I got to fill out these line-of-duty reports
for your brother, for Joseph.

678
00:46:36,693 --> 00:46:39,025
I didn't know this
was going to happen, Pop.

679
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:41,925
Yeah, well...

680
00:46:41,925 --> 00:46:44,329
...what can you do, right?

681
00:46:46,170 --> 00:46:48,138
I don't want you to get hurt.

682
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:52,331
Don't worry about me.
Just worry about yourself.

683
00:46:52,331 --> 00:46:55,740
I hear anything about your brother,
I will call you. Goodbye.

684
00:46:59,783 --> 00:47:01,910
Goodbye.

685
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:36,843
Hey, baby.

686
00:47:36,843 --> 00:47:38,988
Hey, babe.

687
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:44,049
How's your father?
Is he holding up okay?

688
00:47:44,049 --> 00:47:47,254
- Yeah.
- Good.

689
00:47:47,254 --> 00:47:50,730
I heard on the television
your brother's doing better.

690
00:47:53,103 --> 00:47:56,095
Me and my mom,
we said a prayer for him.

691
00:47:57,541 --> 00:47:59,372
Thanks, baby.

692
00:48:00,777 --> 00:48:02,972
Did they find out who did it?

693
00:48:08,185 --> 00:48:09,413
Baby?

694
00:48:14,458 --> 00:48:16,426
It was Vadim.

695
00:48:17,895 --> 00:48:20,523
Vadim shot Joseph.

696
00:48:20,523 --> 00:48:23,029
Oh, my God.

697
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,430
Oh, my God.

698
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:28,935
They tried to tell me...

699
00:48:28,935 --> 00:48:32,803
...but I didn't listen.
- Oh, my God.

700
00:48:32,803 --> 00:48:36,503
Bobby, what are we going to do?

701
00:49:07,511 --> 00:49:08,978
Michael.

702
00:49:14,184 --> 00:49:15,515
Hey.

703
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:20,688
You been up to see Joe?

704
00:49:20,688 --> 00:49:25,260
Yeah. He's doing much better.
They reset his jaw this morning.

705
00:49:25,260 --> 00:49:30,560
He was awake when I left him.
Your old man's up there with him now.

706
00:49:30,968 --> 00:49:32,629
How you doing?

707
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:38,564
You can't protect my father.

708
00:49:38,564 --> 00:49:41,540
We will do the best we can.

709
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:44,510
Those guys aren't afraid
of the police.

710
00:49:45,582 --> 00:49:48,176
If anything should happen to him...

711
00:49:52,022 --> 00:49:54,490
Listen, that thing
you were talking about...

712
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:59,027
...if I wanted to help you,
what would I have to do?

713
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:05,562
I will call you.

714
00:50:11,942 --> 00:50:15,207
There's a wire in here.
We hear everything that goes down.

715
00:50:15,207 --> 00:50:19,076
We'd also have a tail on you,
so we'd be with you at all times.

716
00:50:19,750 --> 00:50:22,685
Small. Light as a feather.

717
00:50:24,488 --> 00:50:26,319
You're fucking kidding me. That's it?

718
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:30,722
That's it. That's the risk.
You just got to find that stash house.

719
00:50:30,722 --> 00:50:33,260
- This can't get out.
- It won't.

720
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:40,067
Well, what if
something goes wrong?

721
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:45,072
Give me a word.
First word comes to your mind.

722
00:50:47,811 --> 00:50:49,608
- Feather.
- Okay.

723
00:50:49,608 --> 00:50:53,443
Anytime we hear the word "feather,"
we come in early.

724
00:50:53,443 --> 00:50:57,144
Otherwise, stay there, do what you
got to do and get the fuck out.

725
00:50:57,144 --> 00:51:00,915
- This will all be kept confidential.
- Yeah, it better.

726
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:06,090
You get burnt, we have to
put you into protection.

727
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:08,629
That's better than ending up dead.

728
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:12,626
- Fuck.
- Listen...

729
00:51:12,626 --> 00:51:15,431
...nobody will ever know
you're involved.

730
00:51:15,431 --> 00:51:19,564
Not your father, not your girlfriend,
nobody.

731
00:51:19,564 --> 00:51:23,008
And maybe someday your brother
will thank you for all this.

732
00:51:23,008 --> 00:51:24,909
So, Bobby...

733
00:51:25,482 --> 00:51:28,349
<i>... you call Vadim's people
and set it up.</i>

734
00:51:28,349 --> 00:51:32,511
<i>You won't see us, but we will be
following your every move.</i>

735
00:51:32,511 --> 00:51:36,022
<i>Don't be a hero.
Don't make conversation.</i>

736
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:40,191
<i>You sense they're onto you,
just remember the word is "feather."</i>

737
00:51:40,464 --> 00:51:42,625
<i>Your life is in that lighter.</i>

738
00:51:43,166 --> 00:51:44,758
<i>Good luck.</i>

739
00:52:03,653 --> 00:52:06,213
Bobkes. Jesus.

740
00:52:06,213 --> 00:52:08,186
Where you been?
I left you a message.

741
00:52:08,186 --> 00:52:10,519
- Yeah, I got it. Thanks.
- You all right?

742
00:52:10,519 --> 00:52:12,321
- Yeah.
- What's the matter? You sick?

743
00:52:12,321 --> 00:52:14,361
Yeah, I have been out of it.
I got to...

744
00:52:14,361 --> 00:52:15,691
Come on, Amada's here.

745
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,729
- Two Jack Daniels, please.
- No, no, no.

746
00:52:17,729 --> 00:52:21,359
I got to take care of something.
I will call you tomorrow.

747
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:23,768
All right. Call me tomorrow.

748
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:40,184
Please.

749
00:52:42,592 --> 00:52:44,685
See my friends out there?

750
00:52:47,197 --> 00:52:50,564
Vadim is really glad
that you made up your mind.

751
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:53,126
He's very happy.

752
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:57,630
You ready?

753
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:01,842
Yeah.

754
00:53:03,813 --> 00:53:06,748
You will meet me at the boardwalk
in one hour.

755
00:53:06,748 --> 00:53:08,612
For your protection, and for ours...

756
00:53:08,612 --> 00:53:12,016
...you will be searched and blindfolded
as we arrive.

757
00:53:12,016 --> 00:53:14,555
You will be able
to sample the product...

758
00:53:14,555 --> 00:53:17,716
...see if you like it. I am sure you will.

759
00:53:17,716 --> 00:53:20,692
You will discuss the rest
of the details with Vadim.

760
00:53:20,692 --> 00:53:23,355
Don't raise your voice,
he doesn't like it.

761
00:53:24,935 --> 00:53:26,800
And for me...

762
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:31,870
...l am taking you to the place
where I never took anybody before...

763
00:53:31,870 --> 00:53:34,533
...especially no Americans.

764
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:39,413
And I don't trust you
the way Vadim does.

765
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:42,510
So don't.

766
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:44,478
All right?

767
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:49,381
And if you want to see
your girlfriend ever again...

768
00:53:49,381 --> 00:53:50,992
...you will come alone.

769
00:53:53,930 --> 00:53:57,058
Boardwalk. One hour.

770
00:54:55,992 --> 00:54:59,120
You don't mind
that I sit behind, do you?

771
00:54:59,896 --> 00:55:01,955
Do what you got to do.

772
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:08,796
Let me see your hands.

773
00:57:13,963 --> 00:57:16,932
Take this. Put it on.

774
00:58:56,866 --> 00:58:58,527
What do you think?

775
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:01,630
Good.

776
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:05,337
What do you got there?
How many keys?

777
00:59:05,337 --> 00:59:07,772
What, like three to four months?

778
00:59:07,772 --> 00:59:09,912
It's not going to dry up on us, is it?

779
00:59:09,912 --> 00:59:12,877
We got a whole lot of stuff
coming in...

780
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:15,411
...in a way nobody could ever trace.

781
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:28,022
All the shit I got in here,
at least 86 percent pure.

782
00:59:28,022 --> 00:59:29,687
Sasha.

783
00:59:48,751 --> 00:59:50,912
The whole city will be
sucking our glass soon.

784
00:59:50,912 --> 00:59:53,681
We will push the guineas out.
The Domos will work for us.

785
00:59:53,681 --> 00:59:54,591
It's good.

786
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:55,319
It's good.

787
00:59:58,528 --> 01:00:00,553
So where's this coming from?

788
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:17,271
You're breathing heavy.

789
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:20,645
Yeah, because I just took a hit.

790
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:31,124
You know, I seen fighters
breathe like that.

791
01:00:31,124 --> 01:00:33,421
It means they get nervous.

792
01:00:33,696 --> 01:00:36,529
- Are you nervous?
- No.

793
01:00:38,034 --> 01:00:40,002
I told you,
it's because I took some shit.

794
01:00:40,002 --> 01:00:42,228
What do I have
to be nervous about?

795
01:00:49,145 --> 01:00:50,703
They already searched me.

796
01:00:51,581 --> 01:00:53,913
I am not here to fuck you.
What are you doing?

797
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:20,371
How come you got both
matches and a lighter?

798
01:01:23,046 --> 01:01:26,140
I am feeling light as a feather
from that shit.

799
01:01:31,654 --> 01:01:33,622
- What?
- Feeling light as a feather...

800
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:35,754
...from that stuff.

801
01:01:45,635 --> 01:01:48,229
- He's wired.
- No, wait.

802
01:01:48,905 --> 01:01:51,499
You were right.
Kill the motherfucker.

803
01:01:51,499 --> 01:01:53,938
Wait. Wait! Wait!

804
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:12,891
Get up! Get over there!

805
01:02:14,997 --> 01:02:16,658
Take the roof. Bobby!

806
01:02:23,973 --> 01:02:25,065
Get the weapon!

807
01:02:29,011 --> 01:02:30,478
Go, go!

808
01:02:44,627 --> 01:02:47,118
- Police! Don't move!
- I am with you! I am with you!

809
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:49,495
Don't move!

810
01:03:00,076 --> 01:03:02,101
Police! Don't move!

811
01:03:02,101 --> 01:03:05,736
Put your hands up! Put your
hands up! Put your hands up!

812
01:03:05,736 --> 01:03:07,644
Back up to my voice!

813
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:13,920
- Who is he? Is he one of us?
- He's still breathing.

814
01:03:14,557 --> 01:03:15,990
Get him a stretcher, quick.

815
01:03:15,990 --> 01:03:19,060
<i>Copy that, Rescue 238.
Patient is a Caucasian male...</i>

816
01:03:19,060 --> 01:03:22,163
<i>... mid-30s, with a leg fracture,
broken ribs, abrasions...</i>

817
01:03:22,163 --> 01:03:24,026
<i>... and a possible neck injury.</i>

818
01:03:38,915 --> 01:03:41,110
Where's Bobby? Where's my son?

819
01:03:41,110 --> 01:03:43,548
He's in the bus, chief.
They said he will be okay.

820
01:03:43,548 --> 01:03:46,347
You guys call an operation
like this without telling me?

821
01:03:46,347 --> 01:03:48,217
You think I was born yesterday?

822
01:03:48,217 --> 01:03:50,256
- He came to me.
- He could have been killed!

823
01:03:50,256 --> 01:03:52,155
- Are you out of your mind?
- I am sorry.

824
01:03:52,155 --> 01:03:55,354
Well, my son's got to go into
protection now. Thank you very much.

825
01:03:55,354 --> 01:03:56,964
- It was his idea.
- Where is he?

826
01:03:56,964 --> 01:03:59,601
I want to see him. Is he all right?

827
01:04:00,736 --> 01:04:03,261
He's a dead man.

828
01:04:13,916 --> 01:04:15,907
You hear me, son?

829
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:22,853
Crazy kid.

830
01:04:23,459 --> 01:04:25,359
Stupid kid.

831
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:26,552
Pop...

832
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:29,589
...my girlfriend.

833
01:04:30,533 --> 01:04:32,694
Call my girlfriend.

834
01:04:34,270 --> 01:04:36,363
Don't worry. I will call her, all right?

835
01:04:36,363 --> 01:04:39,167
I will let your brother know too.

836
01:04:39,976 --> 01:04:41,910
We got to get you...

837
01:04:43,512 --> 01:04:45,776
Get you well again.

838
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:48,944
Things are going to be different
for you now, Bobby.

839
01:04:48,944 --> 01:04:51,746
We're going to
have to protect you now.

840
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:03,699
<i>1010 WINS. You give us 22 minutes,
we will give you the world.</i>

841
01:05:03,699 --> 01:05:05,758
<i>1010 WINS. You give us 22 minutes,
we will give you the world.</i>

842
01:05:05,758 --> 01:05:09,200
<i>This is Stan Brooks in Queens.
Police captain Joseph Grusinsky...</i>

843
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,772
<i>... is leaving Jamaica Hospital
this afternoon.</i>

844
01:05:11,772 --> 01:05:15,468
<i>His doctors cleared him for release
following a four-month stay.</i>

845
01:05:15,468 --> 01:05:18,637
<i>The 11-year veteran was shot
in the face by a masked gunman...</i>

846
01:05:18,637 --> 01:05:22,341
<i>... outside his home
the night before Thanksgiving.</i>

847
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:27,089
Hey, big guys,
let's see what you got.

848
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:29,588
Get out. Get lost.

849
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:33,988
Everybody, I see the car.

850
01:05:36,065 --> 01:05:37,589
Here they are.

851
01:05:45,942 --> 01:05:48,001
Welcome home, Joe.

852
01:05:50,046 --> 01:05:52,640
Welcome home. We love you.

853
01:05:52,640 --> 01:05:55,010
Hey, kiddo. You look great.

854
01:05:55,518 --> 01:05:57,748
- Welcome home.
- Hey, Bob.

855
01:05:59,822 --> 01:06:01,517
- I saw your guards out there.
- Daddy!

856
01:06:01,517 --> 01:06:04,182
- I didn't think they'd let you come.
- No, I wanted to.

857
01:06:04,182 --> 01:06:07,329
What's up? What's up, buddy?

858
01:06:07,329 --> 01:06:10,659
- Hey, how's your leg? You all right?
- Yeah. I am glad you're home.

859
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,227
Hey, we will talk later, all right?

860
01:06:14,270 --> 01:06:17,000
Everyone, let's move inside.
There's plenty to eat.

861
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,300
You going to eat? Young lady. No?

862
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:26,277
Stop it!

863
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:28,378
Joe, you look just great.

864
01:06:29,285 --> 01:06:32,049
- Does it hurt at all?
- Yeah, a little, when I look at you.

865
01:06:32,049 --> 01:06:35,486
Oh, finally. Finally he gets you back.

866
01:06:35,691 --> 01:06:37,989
Do you think maybe we could
go see my mom?

867
01:06:37,989 --> 01:06:41,755
No, honey, they made an exception
for this. I am sorry, I don't think you can.

868
01:06:41,755 --> 01:06:43,421
Hey, Pop.

869
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:46,764
You want to go outside and
talk a little business on the porch?

870
01:06:46,764 --> 01:06:48,961
It's time you
brought me back up to speed.

871
01:06:48,961 --> 01:06:50,730
Whatever you say. Let's go.

872
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:54,271
Bobby, come on, I want you
to hear this. It's for the trial.

873
01:06:54,271 --> 01:06:56,434
- All right.
- Baby, I want to go.

874
01:06:56,434 --> 01:06:59,638
No, stay here. I will be 10 minutes,
tops. Let me just go back.

875
01:06:59,638 --> 01:07:03,114
No. Just wait here. We will go back
to the motel together.

876
01:07:03,114 --> 01:07:05,515
Hey, Sandra, these brownies
are really good.

877
01:07:05,515 --> 01:07:07,087
Careful.

878
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:10,720
<i>Nezhinski's cache was
even bigger than we thought.</i>

879
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,890
Forty kilos of yayo. Angel dust too.

880
01:07:13,890 --> 01:07:15,860
We got to try to
make a deal with him...

881
01:07:15,860 --> 01:07:18,023
...find out how they're bringing it in.

882
01:07:18,023 --> 01:07:20,134
He might not be too reliable, Pop.

883
01:07:20,134 --> 01:07:22,270
Hey, listen, you marry an ape...

884
01:07:22,270 --> 01:07:24,736
...you don't complain
about the stench of bananas.

885
01:07:25,007 --> 01:07:28,374
- Where is he now?
- At Rikers, tucked in nice and comfy.

886
01:07:28,374 --> 01:07:30,273
We take him
to the ADA's next week.

887
01:07:30,273 --> 01:07:33,381
Good, I want to go with you on that.
I want to see his fucking face.

888
01:07:33,381 --> 01:07:37,417
We got to lean hard, get him to open
up. We got nowhere else to look.

889
01:07:37,417 --> 01:07:39,554
Well, what about his uncle?
Buzhayev?

890
01:07:39,554 --> 01:07:41,314
No, he's clean.

891
01:07:41,314 --> 01:07:44,084
We tapped his phone, tailed him.
We got nothing.

892
01:07:44,460 --> 01:07:45,927
Went to his fur store on Monday.

893
01:07:45,927 --> 01:07:48,757
Tuesday he took his grandkids
horseback riding.

894
01:07:48,757 --> 01:07:51,456
- Nothing there.
- I will tell you, the streets are dead.

895
01:07:51,456 --> 01:07:55,229
The junkies are out there waiting
for something big, no question.

896
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:57,996
Well, we got their number one.

897
01:07:57,996 --> 01:08:00,768
got to put the full-court press
on him, get him to fold.

898
01:08:00,768 --> 01:08:03,468
- It won't work.
- What?

899
01:08:06,782 --> 01:08:09,808
He won't trust you. These guys
think of you like you're a joke.

900
01:08:09,808 --> 01:08:12,783
They call you Mickey Mouse.
He's not going to turn for you.

901
01:08:12,783 --> 01:08:16,288
Listen to the expert here. You don't
got to get involved in this no more.

902
01:08:16,288 --> 01:08:19,326
I asked him to come in.
He's got to know all this to testify.

903
01:08:19,326 --> 01:08:21,520
This is official police business, Pop.

904
01:08:21,520 --> 01:08:24,427
You going to make him an honorary
member of the department?

905
01:08:24,427 --> 01:08:26,591
- What's the matter with you?
- He's right.

906
01:08:26,591 --> 01:08:28,134
Didn't you hear what I said?

907
01:08:29,071 --> 01:08:32,302
I asked him to come in here.
I brought him in.

908
01:08:32,302 --> 01:08:35,672
Your brother's got a price on his head
and you talk to him like that?

909
01:08:40,716 --> 01:08:42,877
- Let's go.
- You have to wait for another car.

910
01:08:42,877 --> 01:08:46,317
Ms. Juarez just left.
She went to her mother's.

911
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:48,151
- Bobby.
- What?

912
01:08:48,151 --> 01:08:50,656
What was said in there,
he didn't mean it.

913
01:08:50,656 --> 01:08:52,487
Ever since this thing happened...

914
01:08:52,487 --> 01:08:55,687
...he flies off the handle sometimes.
But, you know...

915
01:08:56,031 --> 01:08:58,261
Doctor says it may be part
of a stress disorder.

916
01:08:58,261 --> 01:09:01,267
- Needs a little more time to adjust.
- I understand that, Pop.

917
01:09:01,267 --> 01:09:04,634
I got my own shit to deal with.
I got a girlfriend that's pissed off.

918
01:09:04,634 --> 01:09:06,638
I just want this to be over with.

919
01:09:06,638 --> 01:09:10,301
Listen to me. A lot of people been
talking about how good you did.

920
01:09:10,301 --> 01:09:14,210
Now, I think,
considering the alternatives...

921
01:09:14,950 --> 01:09:17,544
...maybe you ought to think
about going on the job.

922
01:09:18,053 --> 01:09:21,045
You got special knowledge.
The department likes that.

923
01:09:21,045 --> 01:09:22,485
I am going to go, Pop.

924
01:09:22,485 --> 01:09:25,752
Why do you have to go?
Where you going?

925
01:09:31,100 --> 01:09:33,398
- Think fast.
- Hey.

926
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,070
Hello.

927
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:43,735
- When is she going to marry me?
- That is my mother. That's gross.

928
01:09:51,987 --> 01:09:54,683
- Is it all clear? Good.
- Place is clear.

929
01:09:56,158 --> 01:09:59,059
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

930
01:10:03,165 --> 01:10:05,429
I am sorry, but she can't be here
right now, okay?

931
01:10:05,429 --> 01:10:07,466
Baby, I was just finishing eating.

932
01:10:07,466 --> 01:10:11,538
Just get your stuff, let's go.
I will be outside. I want to talk to you.

933
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,618
She can't do this, Jumbo.

934
01:10:26,618 --> 01:10:30,782
There are people out there trying
to kill me. Understand? It's dangerous.

935
01:10:30,782 --> 01:10:32,154
I... I know.

936
01:10:32,361 --> 01:10:34,852
She called me. I got no idea
where you guys are.

937
01:10:34,852 --> 01:10:37,828
- Because no one can know.
- You all right?

938
01:10:41,337 --> 01:10:43,100
I miss you.

939
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:44,671
Jeez, Bob.

940
01:10:44,671 --> 01:10:47,035
I am stressed out.
Don't know what I am doing.

941
01:10:47,035 --> 01:10:48,767
Me too.

942
01:10:48,767 --> 01:10:52,744
Hey, Bob, everyone's asking
about you at El Caribe.

943
01:10:53,048 --> 01:10:55,278
Freddie and all the girls...

944
01:10:55,278 --> 01:10:58,079
...and Mr. Buzhayev.
I mean, you were like a son to him.

945
01:10:58,079 --> 01:11:00,279
We were surprised
to hear about your family.

946
01:11:00,279 --> 01:11:03,323
Your father's like J. Edgar Hoover.

947
01:11:04,293 --> 01:11:06,261
I am sorry I never said nothing.

948
01:11:06,261 --> 01:11:08,555
Don't worry, Bob. It's all right.

949
01:11:08,555 --> 01:11:12,189
Listen, I got to get her out of here,
and we will call you.

950
01:11:12,501 --> 01:11:14,799
- Let's go.
- Okay.

951
01:11:15,104 --> 01:11:17,368
We got to move. Let's go.

952
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:27,138
She misses me, Bobby.

953
01:11:28,651 --> 01:11:33,145
- You got to see your family.
- I know, baby, but that's different.

954
01:11:33,145 --> 01:11:34,550
How?

955
01:11:34,550 --> 01:11:37,283
Mike and Vitt,
they have a route planned.

956
01:11:37,593 --> 01:11:40,061
You can't just go
and jeopardize all this.

957
01:11:40,061 --> 01:11:42,493
Nobody can even know
what motel we're staying at.

958
01:11:42,493 --> 01:11:44,462
You got to understand that.

959
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:48,927
Listen, baby, Vadim's trial's
in two months.

960
01:11:48,927 --> 01:11:50,503
Two months.

961
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:56,371
I am sorry.

962
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:02,348
It just feels like sometimes
the walls are closing in on me.

963
01:12:02,348 --> 01:12:04,782
It's going to be okay.

964
01:12:17,866 --> 01:12:21,063
I will go in the lead car. You stay
with him till we get to the A.D.A.

965
01:12:21,063 --> 01:12:24,228
Yeah. We got two cars.
One behind, one in front.

966
01:12:24,228 --> 01:12:27,705
If we make a deal with him, then
my brother don't have to testify.

967
01:12:27,705 --> 01:12:29,741
At least that's something.

968
01:12:32,915 --> 01:12:36,180
I am here for an inmate pickup.
Vadim Nezhinski.

969
01:12:37,586 --> 01:12:39,679
- Is he ready?
- Yeah.

970
01:12:40,456 --> 01:12:42,048
They took him 20 minutes ago.

971
01:12:42,791 --> 01:12:45,021
- What?
- He complained of chest pains.

972
01:12:45,021 --> 01:12:47,321
They had to take him down
to Elmhurst Hospital.

973
01:12:47,321 --> 01:12:48,554
Elmhurst Hospital?

974
01:12:48,554 --> 01:12:51,427
Yeah, we had to do it.
It's the law.

975
01:12:53,235 --> 01:12:54,998
Give me the phone.

976
01:12:56,338 --> 01:12:57,999
You deaf?
Give me the fucking phone!

977
01:12:57,999 --> 01:12:59,606
Hey, what's wrong with you?

978
01:13:01,310 --> 01:13:03,369
Thanks for being here.

979
01:13:05,147 --> 01:13:08,173
I know it's been really hard.

980
01:13:14,556 --> 01:13:16,114
Yeah.

981
01:13:17,126 --> 01:13:21,085
Bobby, your brother just called.
We have an emergency.

982
01:13:21,085 --> 01:13:24,630
Nezhinski's out. So get your stuff
together, we're moving you.

983
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:26,290
- What?
- He escaped.

984
01:13:26,290 --> 01:13:28,902
They took him to the hospital
with chest pains. He...

985
01:13:28,902 --> 01:13:32,507
He had cooperation from the outside.
Our guys got ambushed.

986
01:13:34,042 --> 01:13:36,101
Start packing up, sweetheart.
Let's go.

987
01:13:36,101 --> 01:13:40,408
Somebody might know this location.
We better get you moved.

988
01:13:41,049 --> 01:13:44,382
I will meet you outside, all right?
Let's go.

989
01:13:57,166 --> 01:13:59,691
The backup should be here
any minute.

990
01:13:59,691 --> 01:14:02,268
Probably got held up in the rain.

991
01:14:03,439 --> 01:14:05,430
You all right?

992
01:14:09,144 --> 01:14:13,808
- Pop, I am fucked.
- No, you're not. You will be okay.

993
01:14:18,454 --> 01:14:20,684
You're never going to get Nezhinski.

994
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:22,953
Me and Amada
can't take this anymore.

995
01:14:22,953 --> 01:14:26,492
- Bobby.
- I don't know what to do.

996
01:14:27,729 --> 01:14:29,697
I am going to protect you, all right?

997
01:14:31,099 --> 01:14:33,226
I will make you a promise right now.

998
01:14:33,936 --> 01:14:36,029
I am going to protect you.

999
01:14:37,206 --> 01:14:38,639
Don't worry.

1000
01:14:42,010 --> 01:14:45,468
It's going to be okay, son.
We will see it through.

1001
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:49,975
- Chief?
- Yeah.

1002
01:14:49,975 --> 01:14:52,620
- We have three vehicles on the way.
- Okay.

1003
01:14:52,620 --> 01:14:54,050
We will move them to Corona.

1004
01:14:54,050 --> 01:14:55,656
I will lead the line.

1005
01:14:56,959 --> 01:14:59,154
- Let's go, son.
- Honey.

1006
01:14:59,154 --> 01:15:01,990
You guys stay close behind my car.

1007
01:15:16,512 --> 01:15:19,413
<i>There's flooding up ahead.
Watch my brake lights.</i>

1008
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:22,976
It's really coming down.

1009
01:15:25,521 --> 01:15:28,319
Vitt, where's the car that's
supposed to be following us?

1010
01:15:28,319 --> 01:15:30,890
He should be right behind us,
Bobby.

1011
01:15:31,894 --> 01:15:34,863
Shit, I left the watch you gave me
at the hotel.

1012
01:15:35,330 --> 01:15:37,298
Is that it on the right?

1013
01:15:39,701 --> 01:15:41,635
- Vitt!
- Oh, my God!

1014
01:15:41,635 --> 01:15:43,395
Amada, get down! Get down!

1015
01:15:44,740 --> 01:15:48,574
- Oh, my God! Oh, my God!
- Motherfucker!

1016
01:15:48,574 --> 01:15:50,439
Oh, my God!

1017
01:15:50,439 --> 01:15:53,638
What the fuck?!
How'd they find us?

1018
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:57,418
<i>- Amada, stay down!
- Get off, they're shooting.</i>

1019
01:15:58,153 --> 01:15:59,950
<i>Get off the road!</i>

1020
01:16:00,889 --> 01:16:02,049
Fuck.

1021
01:16:07,563 --> 01:16:09,258
Fuck!

1022
01:16:09,258 --> 01:16:13,424
<i>Get off! Now! I will take care of them!</i>

1023
01:16:31,253 --> 01:16:34,950
<i>Get off the road, Bobby!
Get off the road! Get off!</i>

1024
01:16:37,025 --> 01:16:39,619
You hit? Amada, are you hit?
You hit?

1025
01:16:39,619 --> 01:16:42,958
- No! No!
- You hit?

1026
01:16:52,374 --> 01:16:54,001
Jesus.

1027
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:16,163
Pop, pull over!

1028
01:17:16,598 --> 01:17:18,828
Pull over! Pull over!

1029
01:18:50,892 --> 01:18:54,692
You're in a suite at the Sheraton
near Kennedy Airport.

1030
01:18:54,692 --> 01:18:57,024
Your brother is here for you.

1031
01:19:21,790 --> 01:19:24,156
I wanted to let you sleep a little bit.

1032
01:19:24,156 --> 01:19:26,055
Where's Pop?

1033
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:29,492
I had to go and identify the body.

1034
01:19:38,507 --> 01:19:41,806
I saw him die.

1035
01:19:42,611 --> 01:19:45,444
It's all right.
It's going to be okay, all right?

1036
01:19:45,444 --> 01:19:48,208
- I don't want to be alone.
- I know.

1037
01:19:48,717 --> 01:19:50,412
I am here.

1038
01:19:50,886 --> 01:19:52,376
Now, don't worry, all right?

1039
01:19:52,376 --> 01:19:55,546
I will be ready to come back and
head things up, and we will get him.

1040
01:19:56,091 --> 01:20:00,118
You just wait till after the funeral.
They're going to get Nezhinski.

1041
01:20:00,118 --> 01:20:02,559
- How did they know where we were?
- It's all right.

1042
01:20:03,031 --> 01:20:05,329
How'd they find us?

1043
01:21:05,126 --> 01:21:07,151
Your father was a great man.

1044
01:21:07,151 --> 01:21:08,921
Thank you.

1045
01:21:10,265 --> 01:21:12,927
He gave me his combat ribbon...

1046
01:21:12,927 --> 01:21:15,695
...after we got back from Korea.

1047
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:20,174
I was going to put it in with him...

1048
01:21:20,174 --> 01:21:23,641
...but I think he would have wanted
you to have it now.

1049
01:21:24,179 --> 01:21:25,942
Thanks.

1050
01:21:26,381 --> 01:21:28,406
It's now in your hands...

1051
01:21:28,406 --> 01:21:30,778
...but we're going to help you
get Nezhinski.

1052
01:21:31,119 --> 01:21:32,950
And we got a lead, Joe.

1053
01:21:32,950 --> 01:21:34,918
Word got back
from one of our uncles...

1054
01:21:34,918 --> 01:21:38,389
...that a big Russian shipment's
coming in sometime next week.

1055
01:21:38,389 --> 01:21:40,289
We will find it.

1056
01:21:40,996 --> 01:21:43,829
Your father will not
have died in vain.

1057
01:22:00,315 --> 01:22:02,840
You're not sleeping again.

1058
01:22:04,552 --> 01:22:07,350
Did you take the pills
the doctor gave you?

1059
01:22:08,089 --> 01:22:08,839
No.

1060
01:22:14,763 --> 01:22:16,253
What is this?

1061
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:29,633
Is this a police exam?

1062
01:22:33,848 --> 01:22:37,306
Bobby, is this a police exam?

1063
01:22:38,253 --> 01:22:40,016
Yes.

1064
01:22:46,461 --> 01:22:48,224
Were you going to talk to me
about it?

1065
01:22:49,297 --> 01:22:50,787
Yeah.

1066
01:22:51,433 --> 01:22:53,162
When?

1067
01:22:54,169 --> 01:22:55,898
I don't know.

1068
01:22:59,574 --> 01:23:02,873
Bobby, do you know
how this makes me feel?

1069
01:23:03,545 --> 01:23:07,777
You just went off,
you made this decision.

1070
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:15,154
You didn't even talk to me about it.

1071
01:23:17,459 --> 01:23:20,895
After this nightmare
we have been through?

1072
01:23:20,895 --> 01:23:24,156
I don't know if I could
live through that again.

1073
01:23:26,935 --> 01:23:29,904
You're going to join the police, Bobby?

1074
01:23:30,472 --> 01:23:33,999
Baby, you could be killed.
Look at your brother.

1075
01:23:33,999 --> 01:23:36,109
Your father, he died for nothing.

1076
01:23:36,109 --> 01:23:38,302
No! No!

1077
01:23:38,302 --> 01:23:41,210
Don't talk about them!
You don't talk about them!

1078
01:23:41,210 --> 01:23:44,011
- You want to get shot like him?
- Don't talk about them!

1079
01:23:44,753 --> 01:23:47,551
Do not talk about them!
You don't understand!

1080
01:23:49,157 --> 01:23:52,126
You can't do this!
I won't let you!

1081
01:23:52,126 --> 01:23:54,261
- No, you can't!
- I have to do this!

1082
01:23:54,261 --> 01:23:56,556
- No, you don't!
- I have to do it!

1083
01:23:56,556 --> 01:23:59,427
No, you're going to get yourself killed!

1084
01:23:59,427 --> 01:24:01,398
I fucking hate you!

1085
01:24:15,316 --> 01:24:18,376
<i>The commissioner's aware you have
special knowledge for this case.</i>

1086
01:24:19,354 --> 01:24:21,720
He made it top priority.

1087
01:24:21,720 --> 01:24:23,357
Come.

1088
01:24:28,296 --> 01:24:30,628
We're all very sorry
about your father, Robert.

1089
01:24:30,628 --> 01:24:33,996
- Thank you.
- Pursuant to your request...

1090
01:24:33,996 --> 01:24:36,865
...we have decided to grant you
a special dispensation...

1091
01:24:36,865 --> 01:24:38,972
...and appoint you
a conditional member...

1092
01:24:38,972 --> 01:24:41,574
...of this department,
effective immediately.

1093
01:24:41,574 --> 01:24:44,007
- I appreciate that.
- Good.

1094
01:24:44,007 --> 01:24:48,115
You will be required to go to the
academy once this case is completed.

1095
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:50,942
- You know that?
- Yes, I do.

1096
01:24:51,319 --> 01:24:52,650
All right, then.

1097
01:24:52,650 --> 01:24:55,915
Would you raise
your right hand, please?

1098
01:24:56,591 --> 01:24:59,788
"I, Robert Green,
hereby pledge and declare...

1099
01:24:59,788 --> 01:25:02,953
...that I will support and defend
the Constitution..."

1100
01:25:03,431 --> 01:25:06,696
I, Robert Green,
hereby pledge and declare...

1101
01:25:06,696 --> 01:25:09,632
...that I will support and defend
the Constitution...

1102
01:25:09,632 --> 01:25:11,704
<i>"...both of
the United States government...</i>

1103
01:25:11,704 --> 01:25:14,501
<i>... and the state of New York,

1104
01:25:14,501 --> 01:25:16,541
<i>- both of
the United States government...</i>

1105
01:25:16,541 --> 01:25:19,839
<i>... and the state of New York,

1106
01:25:19,839 --> 01:25:24,644
<i>"I will faithfully discharge my duties
in the rank of probationary officer..."</i>

1107
01:25:24,644 --> 01:25:29,279
<i>I will faithfully discharge my duties
in the rank of probationary officer...</i>

1108
01:25:29,279 --> 01:25:31,482
<i>"...in the New York City
Police Department. "</i>

1109
01:25:31,482 --> 01:25:33,650
- In the New York City
Police Department.

1110
01:25:33,650 --> 01:25:37,389
- "So help me God."
- So help me God.

1111
01:25:37,389 --> 01:25:40,125
Congratulations, Robert,
and welcome.

1112
01:25:40,125 --> 01:25:41,325
Thank you.

1113
01:25:41,325 --> 01:25:43,232
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1114
01:25:43,232 --> 01:25:45,634
<i>They're all expecting you
down at the precinct.</i>

1115
01:25:45,634 --> 01:25:50,710
<i>Work all your contacts. We got to find
out where that deal is going down.</i>

1116
01:25:51,045 --> 01:25:53,809
<i>Jumbo, I am not going to party,
but I need to talk to you.</i>

1117
01:25:54,716 --> 01:25:58,379
All right, so, look, I will come down later
and I will see you there. All right.

1118
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:00,712
No, don't tell Freddie.

1119
01:26:00,712 --> 01:26:02,550
Jumbo, listen to me.

1120
01:26:02,550 --> 01:26:06,023
Just meet me at El Caribe
at 11:30, all right?

1121
01:26:06,023 --> 01:26:07,752
All right.

1122
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:09,796
Hey.

1123
01:26:10,698 --> 01:26:12,461
You get your ID card this morning?

1124
01:26:12,461 --> 01:26:16,331
Yeah, but they wouldn't give me
a piece. I should have one.

1125
01:26:16,871 --> 01:26:18,771
I will get you one.

1126
01:26:20,375 --> 01:26:23,173
Pop always said
you were a good shot.

1127
01:26:27,415 --> 01:26:30,612
- What's the matter, Joe?
- Nothing.

1128
01:26:31,286 --> 01:26:33,618
It's kind of weird seeing you here.

1129
01:26:36,724 --> 01:26:39,488
- Yeah, I know.
- Bobby.

1130
01:26:40,728 --> 01:26:43,788
I never meant
to get you involved in all this.

1131
01:26:43,788 --> 01:26:45,364
I am sorry.

1132
01:26:45,364 --> 01:26:48,434
You don't got to apologize to me.

1133
01:26:49,437 --> 01:26:52,338
I never listened to you or Pop.

1134
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:56,070
You want to hear something funny?

1135
01:26:56,544 --> 01:26:58,978
I was kind of jealous of you for that.

1136
01:27:01,149 --> 01:27:03,743
I was. I don't think
I had a lot of faith in myself.

1137
01:27:03,743 --> 01:27:06,182
I just did what Pop wanted me to do.

1138
01:27:06,955 --> 01:27:10,618
I mean, you...
I mean, you were free.

1139
01:27:14,028 --> 01:27:16,053
Anyway, look...

1140
01:27:16,053 --> 01:27:18,756
...I didn't mean to get into all this.
It just...

1141
01:27:19,867 --> 01:27:22,665
Maybe it's just because
I ain't been sleeping lately.

1142
01:27:22,665 --> 01:27:26,068
I am kind of having some nightmares
about what happened to me.

1143
01:27:28,409 --> 01:27:29,933
Well...

1144
01:27:33,982 --> 01:27:37,918
...all that matters
is that we finish this.

1145
01:27:38,653 --> 01:27:41,850
And we catch Nezhinski
when that deal goes down.

1146
01:27:41,850 --> 01:27:45,254
Bobby, an Amada Juarez
is calling for you on line three.

1147
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:48,259
- Tell her I will call her back later.
- All right.

1148
01:27:49,964 --> 01:27:51,989
Are you going to be okay?

1149
01:27:54,602 --> 01:27:58,129
I got to go downstairs and
get fitted for a vest, all right?

1150
01:27:58,129 --> 01:27:59,864
Yeah.

1151
01:28:21,062 --> 01:28:22,825
Amada?

1152
01:28:24,198 --> 01:28:25,563
Hey.

1153
01:28:26,100 --> 01:28:29,001
Miss Juarez left about an hour ago.

1154
01:28:29,203 --> 01:28:31,262
She said to give you this.

1155
01:28:37,245 --> 01:28:40,043
- Hey, get me some food, would you?
- Yeah, sure.

1156
01:28:40,043 --> 01:28:43,377
We're checking you out at noon
tomorrow. Get your stuff together.

1157
01:28:43,377 --> 01:28:45,576
I will bring the menus.

1158
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:29,796
Lou.

1159
01:29:29,796 --> 01:29:32,728
My brother. The grand return.

1160
01:29:32,728 --> 01:29:36,392
I can't believe you called. Look at you.
You look great. You look different.

1161
01:29:36,804 --> 01:29:38,567
- Who is this?
- That's my bodyguard.

1162
01:29:38,873 --> 01:29:41,774
Look at this place.
You put more tables up here?

1163
01:29:41,774 --> 01:29:45,003
No. I don't know. Come here.
Come on, have a drink for a second.

1164
01:29:45,003 --> 01:29:48,615
- Why don't you get us some drinks?
- Don't you think you have had enough?

1165
01:29:48,615 --> 01:29:52,219
You want to be a pain in my ass?
You my mother? Get us some drinks.

1166
01:29:52,219 --> 01:29:55,254
- Fuck you in the ass.
- I am ready.

1167
01:29:55,254 --> 01:29:58,449
- I want to talk to you about something.
- Sure.

1168
01:30:00,094 --> 01:30:03,393
You know of anything going down
the next few days? Something major?

1169
01:30:04,899 --> 01:30:05,991
No.

1170
01:30:05,991 --> 01:30:09,330
I mean, they never tell me
their heavy stuff anyway.

1171
01:30:09,330 --> 01:30:12,905
Yeah, but you hear about things.
People talking, anything?

1172
01:30:14,776 --> 01:30:17,267
If I hear anything, I will let you know.

1173
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:21,175
- What about Freddie? He around?
- Freddie's downstairs.

1174
01:30:21,175 --> 01:30:23,647
- Come on, pay attention.
- Where's Amada?

1175
01:30:26,554 --> 01:30:28,112
Bob.

1176
01:30:28,112 --> 01:30:30,621
- She left.
- She left?

1177
01:30:31,526 --> 01:30:33,994
- What do you mean, she left?
- Jumbo, leave it alone.

1178
01:30:33,994 --> 01:30:35,891
Don't worry. Don't worry.

1179
01:30:35,891 --> 01:30:39,032
Amada, she probably
just needs some space.

1180
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:41,192
She will be back.

1181
01:30:41,192 --> 01:30:44,361
Between us, that place they
had you in was driving her crazy...

1182
01:30:44,361 --> 01:30:46,905
...I know that.
The Cue Motor Inn?

1183
01:30:46,905 --> 01:30:50,100
We used to call it the "Screw Motor
Inn," with all the hookers.

1184
01:30:52,613 --> 01:30:54,843
How'd you know
where we were staying?

1185
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:02,589
How did you know
where we were staying?

1186
01:31:05,359 --> 01:31:07,520
It was in the papers.

1187
01:31:08,062 --> 01:31:10,860
You know, those reporters,
they got their noses everywhere.

1188
01:31:10,860 --> 01:31:13,364
Always looking through
everybody's garbage.

1189
01:31:13,364 --> 01:31:16,503
Anyway, homeslice,
what do you think of the floorshow?

1190
01:31:16,503 --> 01:31:20,072
want to go downstairs for a bit?
Go outside? It's loud in here.

1191
01:31:20,072 --> 01:31:22,505
- What?
- Talk, catch up?

1192
01:31:24,078 --> 01:31:26,137
You want to go outside?
We got drinks coming.

1193
01:31:26,137 --> 01:31:29,147
Forget the drinks. I haven't
seen you in forever. Let's go.

1194
01:31:29,147 --> 01:31:31,615
- It's cold out.
- Get your coat.

1195
01:31:31,615 --> 01:31:34,220
Come on. Give us a few minutes.
It will be all right.

1196
01:31:34,220 --> 01:31:36,618
Okay, but make it quick.

1197
01:31:54,308 --> 01:31:56,799
It wasn't in the papers, Lou.

1198
01:32:05,219 --> 01:32:07,312
Where's Nezhinski?

1199
01:32:07,312 --> 01:32:09,217
I don't know.

1200
01:32:10,391 --> 01:32:12,325
Don't play games with me.

1201
01:32:12,325 --> 01:32:17,226
- I don't know.
- I said, don't play games with me.

1202
01:32:21,068 --> 01:32:24,231
Amada told you where
we were staying, didn't she?

1203
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:27,703
She trusted you like a brother.

1204
01:32:27,703 --> 01:32:30,139
Bob. Come on.

1205
01:32:32,013 --> 01:32:33,776
I swear, I don't know nothing.

1206
01:32:40,354 --> 01:32:43,152
My father's dead because of you.

1207
01:32:44,325 --> 01:32:46,589
You know I am with the police now?

1208
01:32:47,161 --> 01:32:50,324
And I can do anything to you.

1209
01:32:50,324 --> 01:32:54,525
Bob, I told them where you were,
but it ain't what you think.

1210
01:32:54,525 --> 01:32:56,727
Amada said you moved
every couple days.

1211
01:32:56,727 --> 01:33:00,396
I thought you'd be gone by then.
It's the truth. I sw...

1212
01:33:00,396 --> 01:33:02,008
I swear to God.

1213
01:33:02,443 --> 01:33:06,004
I tried to give them
the wrong information. I tried.

1214
01:33:06,004 --> 01:33:09,240
Come on. Tell me who.

1215
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:12,546
Who? Who? Who?

1216
01:33:15,923 --> 01:33:17,550
Marat.

1217
01:33:17,550 --> 01:33:20,023
Marat Buzhayev.

1218
01:33:20,461 --> 01:33:24,454
I am sorry, Bob. I know
he was like a father to you...

1219
01:33:25,399 --> 01:33:26,627
...but he owns me.

1220
01:33:26,627 --> 01:33:31,204
Don't say that! Don't say that!
Don't say that!

1221
01:33:31,539 --> 01:33:34,201
- My eyes.
- You fuck!

1222
01:33:34,642 --> 01:33:38,772
You fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

1223
01:33:38,772 --> 01:33:41,176
You fuck!

1224
01:33:44,819 --> 01:33:46,548
Get up. Get up!

1225
01:33:48,289 --> 01:33:51,520
Get up! Get up!

1226
01:33:53,427 --> 01:33:55,292
<i>This Jumbo Falsetti guy confirmed...</i>

1227
01:33:55,292 --> 01:33:59,524
<i>... that a major shipment
is coming tomorrow for Buzhayev.</i>

1228
01:34:00,134 --> 01:34:03,968
He says Buzhayev uses
his grandkids as couriers.

1229
01:34:03,968 --> 01:34:07,539
They go everywhere for him. That's
why we weren't able to catch him.

1230
01:34:07,539 --> 01:34:10,700
We should have been putting a tail
on a couple of 10-year-olds.

1231
01:34:10,700 --> 01:34:13,346
It's unbelievable.
Did Jumbo know the location?

1232
01:34:13,346 --> 01:34:17,177
No. No, we tried, believe me.
We interrogated him all night.

1233
01:34:17,485 --> 01:34:19,146
He was crying like a 4-year-old.

1234
01:34:19,146 --> 01:34:23,188
But he did say he thought
Nezhinski would be there, though.

1235
01:34:23,188 --> 01:34:25,689
Tomorrow's Tuesday, right?

1236
01:34:25,689 --> 01:34:29,421
Buzhayev takes his grandkids to
Floyd Bennett Field every Tuesday.

1237
01:34:29,421 --> 01:34:31,895
He takes them horseback riding.

1238
01:34:31,895 --> 01:34:34,864
Joe, we should
put our money on that.

1239
01:34:35,302 --> 01:34:38,738
- No, that's not really much to go on.
- You got a better idea?

1240
01:34:38,738 --> 01:34:41,204
Anyone?
We can sit on our fucking asses...

1241
01:34:41,204 --> 01:34:43,502
...or we can crush these...
- Bobby.

1242
01:34:44,045 --> 01:34:46,479
It's a process, you know?

1243
01:34:46,814 --> 01:34:51,376
Look, that's what we got.
I guess that's what we should go with.

1244
01:34:52,887 --> 01:34:54,684
You heard him. Let's go.

1245
01:34:56,323 --> 01:34:58,154
Coats are on the porch.

1246
01:34:58,154 --> 01:35:01,055
Contact ESU. Make sure we don't
come up short, all right?

1247
01:35:01,055 --> 01:35:02,889
We got it covered.

1248
01:35:02,889 --> 01:35:05,294
- Sorry about the mess, Sandra.
- It's all right.

1249
01:35:05,294 --> 01:35:08,731
Joe, you know, they're laughing at us
out there on the street.

1250
01:35:08,731 --> 01:35:11,497
Now, when we get there,
what we do will be up to you.

1251
01:35:11,497 --> 01:35:14,300
But I hope
you drop the hammer on them.

1252
01:35:16,010 --> 01:35:18,103
After your father
and everything else?

1253
01:35:18,379 --> 01:35:21,610
I mean, these people
are like fucking lice.

1254
01:35:22,383 --> 01:35:25,375
Just think about
what I am saying to you.

1255
01:35:28,456 --> 01:35:30,083
Joe.

1256
01:35:30,825 --> 01:35:32,884
Joe, you okay?

1257
01:35:35,129 --> 01:35:37,029
I hear you, GQ.

1258
01:35:50,044 --> 01:35:53,445
Take that, all right?
It's one of Pop's.

1259
01:35:57,017 --> 01:36:00,214
I don't need any more guns in my life,
that's for sure.

1260
01:36:00,214 --> 01:36:02,855
But you should have one to be safe.

1261
01:36:03,858 --> 01:36:07,385
It's better to be judged by 12
than carried by six.

1262
01:37:40,955 --> 01:37:43,583
<i>Joe, we're all ready.
What's the move?</i>

1263
01:37:43,583 --> 01:37:45,554
Wait till they complete the sale.

1264
01:37:45,554 --> 01:37:47,887
Then we move.
ESU will grab the kids.

1265
01:37:52,800 --> 01:37:55,633
They're so fucking close,
the two of them.

1266
01:38:33,240 --> 01:38:36,141
This is what
we have wanted for so long.

1267
01:38:36,343 --> 01:38:40,905
My nephew has stayed
just to see this through.

1268
01:38:42,917 --> 01:38:45,215
When this is done...

1269
01:38:45,619 --> 01:38:48,315
...we will control
almost the whole market.

1270
01:38:50,257 --> 01:38:52,748
Each load is completely untraceable.

1271
01:38:56,297 --> 01:38:59,164
It's my own method.

1272
01:39:00,801 --> 01:39:01,859
Impressive.

1273
01:39:02,569 --> 01:39:07,268
You put the drugs right on the coat.

1274
01:39:07,608 --> 01:39:11,009
We are importing 200 imitation sables
per week.

1275
01:39:40,174 --> 01:39:42,039
Try it.

1276
01:39:49,116 --> 01:39:51,175
Very good. Give them the money.

1277
01:39:53,520 --> 01:39:57,251
All right, deal's about to close.
Let's go.

1278
01:39:57,251 --> 01:40:00,325
This is the police! Drop your weapons.
Come out!

1279
01:40:00,325 --> 01:40:02,018
Police! Put your weapons down!

1280
01:40:02,363 --> 01:40:04,058
They're firing at us.
Everybody down!

1281
01:40:04,331 --> 01:40:06,128
Eli! The kids!

1282
01:40:11,138 --> 01:40:14,039
Get down! Joseph! Get down!

1283
01:40:14,508 --> 01:40:17,534
Joe! Joe, are you hit?

1284
01:40:18,012 --> 01:40:20,879
- What happened?
- He's okay. He's okay.

1285
01:40:22,316 --> 01:40:24,011
He's all right. He ain't hit.

1286
01:40:24,011 --> 01:40:26,550
- Should we move?
- I don't know what's wrong.

1287
01:40:26,550 --> 01:40:28,881
- Bobby. Bobby, take his shotgun.
- Okay.

1288
01:40:28,881 --> 01:40:31,251
- I will stay here with him.
- Go, go, go!

1289
01:40:43,037 --> 01:40:44,334
Run!

1290
01:40:44,334 --> 01:40:46,405
We got runners out the back!

1291
01:40:53,747 --> 01:40:56,215
- It's okay.
- Come with me.

1292
01:40:56,215 --> 01:40:57,407
Keep going! Go! Go!

1293
01:40:57,407 --> 01:40:58,915
- Watch your back!
- Go! Go!

1294
01:40:58,915 --> 01:41:01,350
Kelly, we're going to move to the left!
Let's go.

1295
01:41:01,350 --> 01:41:02,921
Okay.

1296
01:41:08,595 --> 01:41:10,756
Halt! Police!

1297
01:42:00,447 --> 01:42:02,938
Freeze. Hold it right there.

1298
01:42:28,509 --> 01:42:31,444
All right. Fuck!

1299
01:42:33,313 --> 01:42:35,781
We will kill each other in here.

1300
01:42:35,781 --> 01:42:37,940
Nezhinski's in here with us.

1301
01:42:37,940 --> 01:42:40,245
Let's smoke him out.

1302
01:42:40,245 --> 01:42:43,082
Radio our guys.
Tell them to clear out.

1303
01:42:43,082 --> 01:42:44,952
Absolutely.

1304
01:42:46,026 --> 01:42:49,018
<i>We got the old man.
We got Buzhayev.</i>

1305
01:42:49,018 --> 01:42:51,824
All right, guys. Clear out.

1306
01:42:52,933 --> 01:42:55,231
Go on. Into the clearing.

1307
01:43:32,306 --> 01:43:33,026
Bobby!

1308
01:43:34,575 --> 01:43:36,566
Bobby, what are you doing?

1309
01:43:38,045 --> 01:43:39,478
Bobby!

1310
01:43:41,181 --> 01:43:44,344
Don't go in there.
We have Vadim surrounded.

1311
01:43:44,344 --> 01:43:48,420
Be patient, he will come out!
Bobby!

1312
01:43:52,826 --> 01:43:54,418
Bobby!

1313
01:43:57,197 --> 01:43:58,994
Bobby!

1314
01:44:45,312 --> 01:44:46,973
Bobby...

1315
01:44:48,348 --> 01:44:50,213
...fuck you.

1316
01:45:57,617 --> 01:45:59,642
Bobby...

1317
01:45:59,642 --> 01:46:02,880
...I didn't know
it would be your family.

1318
01:46:05,826 --> 01:46:08,056
Get on your knees.

1319
01:46:31,151 --> 01:46:32,812
We're done here.

1320
01:47:39,786 --> 01:47:40,810
Hey, Joe.

1321
01:47:40,810 --> 01:47:42,818
- Can't believe how nervous I am.
- Bobby.

1322
01:47:42,818 --> 01:47:44,183
- Big day.
- Look at you.

1323
01:47:44,391 --> 01:47:47,121
All dressed up, huh?
Looking like a chief.

1324
01:47:47,121 --> 01:47:49,558
I don't know about that.
Maybe a lieutenant.

1325
01:47:49,558 --> 01:47:51,390
- You look good.
- Captain?

1326
01:47:51,390 --> 01:47:54,125
Hey, Joe, I got through
to McClennan at Personnel.

1327
01:47:54,125 --> 01:47:56,132
He's still holding that slot for you...

1328
01:47:56,132 --> 01:47:58,828
...if you're ready
to switch to administration.

1329
01:47:58,828 --> 01:48:01,132
Yeah, can we talk about it
another time?

1330
01:48:01,942 --> 01:48:03,000
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

1331
01:48:03,343 --> 01:48:06,210
- Hey, good luck.
- All right.

1332
01:48:06,780 --> 01:48:08,645
Now, what's this?

1333
01:48:10,016 --> 01:48:12,780
Look, I meant to tell you.

1334
01:48:13,153 --> 01:48:16,782
I got to start doing the right thing.
I got to spend more time at home.

1335
01:48:16,782 --> 01:48:19,187
I got three kids now.
What am I supposed to do?

1336
01:48:19,926 --> 01:48:22,793
Look, I was going to
talk to you about it.

1337
01:48:23,763 --> 01:48:26,027
Do what you need to do.

1338
01:48:26,733 --> 01:48:29,998
They're going to get started.
We should probably go in. Come on.

1339
01:48:32,973 --> 01:48:34,634
Ladies and gentlemen...

1340
01:48:34,634 --> 01:48:38,835
...we shall begin today's ceremony
with the traditional invocation...

1341
01:48:38,835 --> 01:48:41,344
...moving then
to the valedictorian address...

1342
01:48:41,344 --> 01:48:44,279
...to be given by Robert Grusinsky...

1343
01:48:44,951 --> 01:48:48,546
...son of the late
Deputy Chief Albert Grusinsky...

1344
01:48:48,546 --> 01:48:51,714
...brother of
Captain Joseph Grusinsky.

1345
01:48:52,225 --> 01:48:55,752
You know, as I look at that fine
young man seated behind me...

1346
01:48:56,530 --> 01:49:00,296
...I can't help but think of all the
young members of our department.

1347
01:49:01,001 --> 01:49:03,629
I get filled with such pride.

1348
01:49:03,629 --> 01:49:08,638
Men like him
are the future of the force.

1349
01:49:08,638 --> 01:49:12,744
Let us remind ourselves
we are in God's presence.

1350
01:49:12,744 --> 01:49:14,904
Let us pray.

1351
01:49:16,516 --> 01:49:19,280
O God, we come together
at this most joyous occasion...

1352
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:23,548
...the New York City Police
graduation ceremony.

1353
01:49:23,890 --> 01:49:28,054
We ask you to guide, bless and
protect those who are graduating.

1354
01:49:29,296 --> 01:49:33,062
Please bless their families and friends
who gather and share their joy.

1355
01:49:33,062 --> 01:49:35,963
- I love you very much.
- Strengthen us, our Lord...

1356
01:49:35,963 --> 01:49:38,661
...now and forever. Amen.
- I love you too.

1357
01:49:38,661 --> 01:49:39,911
Amen.
