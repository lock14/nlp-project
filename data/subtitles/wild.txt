1
00:01:07,156 --> 00:01:11,626
A tisket, a tasket,
a biscuit for me breakfast...

2
00:01:11,703 --> 00:01:14,706
Come on, Cec,
stop your blabbing.

3
00:01:14,831 --> 00:01:17,504
We're... Almost there!

4
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,965
Look, Rufus, shadow puppets.

5
00:01:24,215 --> 00:01:28,219
I haven't had me breakfast yet, either.

6
00:01:28,302 --> 00:01:30,100
Ratter!

7
00:01:35,685 --> 00:01:36,902
Whoa!

8
00:01:50,198 --> 00:01:52,200
Shadow puppets?

9
00:01:52,284 --> 00:01:53,831
Seriously, mate,

10
00:01:53,953 --> 00:01:56,502
you are one kidney short of a meat pie!

11
00:01:56,622 --> 00:01:57,715
Uh, I was just...

12
00:01:57,789 --> 00:02:00,009
Ah!

13
00:02:01,251 --> 00:02:04,256
What the... Oh!

14
00:02:04,338 --> 00:02:08,343
Get off of me,
ya good-for-nothing fleabag of a cat!

15
00:02:10,427 --> 00:02:14,022
A sailor can't even get
a night's sleep without some...

16
00:02:14,098 --> 00:02:16,725
Blimey! Signal fire
off the starboard bow!

17
00:02:16,808 --> 00:02:20,153
Signal fire! Starboard bow!

18
00:02:24,233 --> 00:02:27,236
Cap'n? Cap'n, wake up!

19
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,697
You wakey, wakey!

20
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,372
Ah! Attack!

21
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,413
Board the ship. Take no prisoners.

22
00:02:32,491 --> 00:02:34,870
Oh. Oh, Bosun, it's you!

23
00:02:34,951 --> 00:02:37,375
Yeah. Sorry to be wake you, Cap'n,

24
00:02:37,497 --> 00:02:40,341
but there's a signal fire
on a small, uncharted island

25
00:02:40,415 --> 00:02:41,793
off the starboard side.

26
00:02:41,876 --> 00:02:43,718
What course of action
shall we be taking?

27
00:02:43,836 --> 00:02:46,088
Let me have a look.

28
00:02:47,006 --> 00:02:50,134
Hmm. Some sort of house on fire.

29
00:02:53,054 --> 00:02:54,396
What's this?

30
00:02:55,389 --> 00:02:57,016
Fire a broadside,

31
00:02:57,099 --> 00:02:59,194
drive those bloody beasts off!

32
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,562
Aye, aye, Cap'n.

33
00:03:00,645 --> 00:03:03,397
Then go and bring back whoever he is.

34
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,824
And Bosun,

35
00:03:04,941 --> 00:03:08,945
make sure they leave
nothing behind of any value.

36
00:03:09,069 --> 00:03:10,616
Will do, Cap'n.

37
00:03:16,786 --> 00:03:18,002
Oh...

38
00:03:20,455 --> 00:03:22,550
Humans?

39
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:25,633
What's yer go-by, fellow?

40
00:03:25,752 --> 00:03:27,129
<i>Crusoe...</i>

41
00:03:27,254 --> 00:03:29,677
Robinson Crusoe.

42
00:03:29,757 --> 00:03:33,102
Oh, looks like them wild beasts
nearly had ya for dinner!

43
00:03:33,218 --> 00:03:35,972
Lucky we found ya when we did.

44
00:03:36,097 --> 00:03:37,348
No, they are my...

45
00:03:37,473 --> 00:03:38,689
Hold on a second, lad!

46
00:03:38,807 --> 00:03:40,651
Let's have a look in there.

47
00:03:42,311 --> 00:03:43,483
Aw!

48
00:03:43,562 --> 00:03:46,236
Not a single gold tooth in his head.

49
00:03:46,314 --> 00:03:47,692
On. Pity-

50
00:03:47,775 --> 00:03:49,448
Pirates?

51
00:03:54,115 --> 00:03:56,834
You be one lucky bloke.

52
00:03:56,908 --> 00:03:58,377
Crusoe, is it?

53
00:03:58,453 --> 00:03:59,954
I'm in your debt, Captain.

54
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,629
Nay, 'twas me eagle-eyed night watch
who done saved your hide.

55
00:04:10,213 --> 00:04:12,592
Away with ya, you blasted bird!

56
00:04:12,675 --> 00:04:14,598
No, Captain, he's with me.

57
00:04:14,718 --> 00:04:16,721
No, Captain, he's with me!

58
00:04:18,555 --> 00:04:20,149
A talking parrot?

59
00:04:21,057 --> 00:04:23,776
What skulduggery is this?

60
00:04:23,894 --> 00:04:26,023
Taught him to talk yourself, did ya?

61
00:04:26,146 --> 00:04:27,899
Yes, Captain.

62
00:04:27,981 --> 00:04:29,324
Drink up!

63
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:31,494
That'll stir your stumps, mate.

64
00:04:31,569 --> 00:04:35,494
Now, tell me more about
this island of yourn.

65
00:04:35,615 --> 00:04:40,245
Is there anything of,
shall we say, value on it?

66
00:04:44,706 --> 00:04:48,711
All I can say is that
I was shipwrecked, marooned,

67
00:04:49,252 --> 00:04:53,132
fending for myself with nothing
but time and very few skills to survive.

68
00:04:56,134 --> 00:04:57,432
Sorry about that.

69
00:04:57,512 --> 00:05:00,560
I see the bird has taught you
how to drink as well.

70
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:03,480
That's not very polite, Tuesday.

71
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,853
You'll have to wait outside, I'm afraid.

72
00:05:08,814 --> 00:05:10,942
Fending for myself?

73
00:05:11,024 --> 00:05:13,197
Really?

74
00:05:16,404 --> 00:05:20,329
Listen, you two want to hear
the true tale of Robinson Crusoe?

75
00:05:20,408 --> 00:05:22,581
Oh! Oh, sure.

76
00:05:22,661 --> 00:05:26,292
We're all ears,
or at least Cecil here is.

77
00:05:26,374 --> 00:05:27,591
Hey, come on, Ruf.

78
00:05:27,667 --> 00:05:32,389
It all began like every other day
before Crusoe came to my island.

79
00:05:32,463 --> 00:05:34,932
Just another day in paradise.

80
00:05:35,048 --> 00:05:37,802
Every day was the same.

81
00:05:37,927 --> 00:05:39,803
Beautiful turquoise water,

82
00:05:39,887 --> 00:05:43,391
blue skies
and lots of delicious fruit. Mmm.

83
00:05:43,473 --> 00:05:45,021
Sounds perfect, right?

84
00:05:47,228 --> 00:05:48,696
<i>Boring if you ask me.</i>

85
00:05:48,771 --> 00:05:51,194
<i>How much paradise can a bird take?</i>

86
00:05:51,314 --> 00:05:53,942
<i>I really wanted to get off this island.</i>

87
00:05:56,778 --> 00:05:59,327
Let's see what's been washed up today?

88
00:06:01,283 --> 00:06:03,377
Of course, more of these.

89
00:06:03,451 --> 00:06:05,170
Oh!

90
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:07,331
What's this?

91
00:06:08,456 --> 00:06:10,425
This could be promising.

92
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,439
- Hey, guys! It's luau time!
- Yeah, yeah. Be right there.

93
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,776
Yee-haa!

94
00:06:37,278 --> 00:06:38,370
Oh!

95
00:06:38,446 --> 00:06:39,492
Hi, Rosie!

96
00:06:39,613 --> 00:06:41,411
Check out these delicious treats!

97
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:43,913
Gorgeous. Just gorgeous!

98
00:06:43,992 --> 00:06:46,542
Just look at all those bugs.

99
00:06:46,661 --> 00:06:49,505
Mmm.
The beetles are the best.

100
00:06:49,581 --> 00:06:53,882
Crunchy on the outside
with a soft, gooey centre.

101
00:06:53,961 --> 00:06:56,088
Hey! Where did it go?

102
00:06:56,254 --> 00:06:58,757
- My kind of bug.
- You thief!

103
00:06:58,841 --> 00:07:01,560
Carmello, that wasn't very nice.

104
00:07:03,428 --> 00:07:06,774
Aren't you joining us for our
luau today, Mak? We're all here.

105
00:07:07,475 --> 00:07:09,398
Yeah. Yeah. I'll...
I'll be right there.

106
00:07:09,476 --> 00:07:12,026
Do we really need
a luau every day?

107
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:15,983
So what did you bring today?

108
00:07:16,776 --> 00:07:19,324
I'm not sure what it is.

109
00:07:19,403 --> 00:07:22,281
I meant food for the luau.

110
00:07:22,365 --> 00:07:25,244
Of course he didn't
bring anything for the luau.

111
00:07:27,661 --> 00:07:31,667
Oh, this is beautiful! Hey, guys, guys!

112
00:07:31,790 --> 00:07:34,715
I think I really found
something important this time!

113
00:07:34,793 --> 00:07:36,216
Check this out!

114
00:07:37,672 --> 00:07:39,014
Where? What?

115
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,475
Scrubby, you're really going blind.

116
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:42,927
Over here.

117
00:07:43,052 --> 00:07:44,928
Ooh, smells delicious.

118
00:07:45,012 --> 00:07:47,560
No, Scrubby, no. It's not food!

119
00:07:47,682 --> 00:07:50,685
It's proof that there's more
to the world than just our island!

120
00:07:50,768 --> 00:07:52,816
Here we go again.

121
00:07:52,894 --> 00:07:54,067
It's true!

122
00:07:54,146 --> 00:07:56,524
Can't we just eat in peace for once?

123
00:07:56,606 --> 00:07:58,324
Sure, no problem,

124
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:01,995
as long as you can tell me
where this came from!

125
00:08:02,112 --> 00:08:05,208
- From the water.
- I vote for Carmello.

126
00:08:05,324 --> 00:08:07,497
I too vote for Carmello.

127
00:08:07,576 --> 00:08:09,293
I too vote for Carmello!

128
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:13,625
Oh, come on, this isn't an election!
This thingamabobble is... is...

129
00:08:13,749 --> 00:08:15,625
ls what?

130
00:08:16,377 --> 00:08:17,923
You know what I think, Mak?

131
00:08:18,004 --> 00:08:20,632
That thingy is whatever
you want to believe it is.

132
00:08:20,714 --> 00:08:21,762
Exactly.

133
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:23,935
You are one hopeless dreamer.

134
00:08:24,009 --> 00:08:26,809
Did you forget
you almost died of exhaustion

135
00:08:26,928 --> 00:08:30,399
flying across the ocean
looking for this other world of yours?

136
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:35,864
My dear macaw,
you must wake up and smell the papaya,

137
00:08:35,937 --> 00:08:37,905
for this is the world!

138
00:08:37,981 --> 00:08:39,609
I don't care what you guys say.

139
00:08:39,692 --> 00:08:43,322
There's a bigger world out there
and I intend to find it.

140
00:08:44,613 --> 00:08:48,493
<i>♪ I ply my trade for the Union Jack</i>

141
00:08:48,576 --> 00:08:52,171
<i>♪ Upon the seven seas</i>

142
00:08:52,288 --> 00:08:55,918
<i>♪ And unless I eat some rancid meat...</i>

143
00:08:57,334 --> 00:09:01,714
<i>♪ Bury me soul with a mermaid,
please ♪</i>

144
00:09:01,797 --> 00:09:03,094
Look, boyos!

145
00:09:03,173 --> 00:09:07,519
Our wannabe map-maker's
a bit green around the gills!

146
00:09:07,595 --> 00:09:11,600
We ain't hankerin' to be
sharin' your lunch with ya, lad.

147
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,688
Sorry, I'm not much of a sailor.

148
00:09:14,769 --> 00:09:16,988
You got that right.

149
00:09:17,062 --> 00:09:21,693
If you're fixin' to upchuck,
find your way downwind!

150
00:09:21,775 --> 00:09:23,072
Ah.

151
00:09:23,152 --> 00:09:26,030
Oh... Your poor stomach...

152
00:09:26,154 --> 00:09:29,455
Just ye wait till ya get
one of them strange islands

153
00:09:29,575 --> 00:09:31,793
and ya meet your first cannibals!

154
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:34,962
Cannibals?

155
00:09:41,796 --> 00:09:45,346
We made our choice to go to sea,
right, Aynsley, old pal?

156
00:09:45,423 --> 00:09:48,052
And I swear, I'll not regret it.

157
00:09:48,134 --> 00:09:49,386
Whoa!

158
00:09:50,053 --> 00:09:52,977
All right.
Go and bring me something to eat!

159
00:09:53,057 --> 00:09:56,481
Right, lovey. I won't fail you.

160
00:10:06,403 --> 00:10:10,499
Hey, which of you lucky clucks
wants to join me

161
00:10:10,573 --> 00:10:13,076
for a little snack?

162
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:15,125
<i>Here, chicky, chicky!</i>

163
00:10:15,955 --> 00:10:17,878
Come on, now,

164
00:10:17,956 --> 00:10:21,211
no need to be shy, my plump little...

165
00:10:22,794 --> 00:10:26,799
What business might you
be having above decks?

166
00:10:26,923 --> 00:10:30,224
Oh, I was, uh, just making sure

167
00:10:30,302 --> 00:10:32,395
my chicken food...

168
00:10:33,054 --> 00:10:35,604
friends were...

169
00:10:35,682 --> 00:10:37,309
were fresh.

170
00:10:37,393 --> 00:10:40,236
No, warm. Warm and comfy.

171
00:10:42,105 --> 00:10:43,903
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

172
00:10:43,982 --> 00:10:47,327
Hold on!
Don't get your fur all in a knot.

173
00:10:52,783 --> 00:10:55,912
So, then, where were we?

174
00:10:55,995 --> 00:10:58,793
Knock it off!
You cats belong down below.

175
00:10:58,873 --> 00:11:00,546
And stay away from our chickens!

176
00:11:09,258 --> 00:11:10,884
And that goes for you as well!

177
00:11:12,552 --> 00:11:16,023
Who does that green-gilled
landlubber think he is?

178
00:11:16,097 --> 00:11:19,852
Uh, the human
who threw us into the hold?

179
00:11:19,934 --> 00:11:23,404
This is our ship!
Wretched as it is, it's home!

180
00:11:23,938 --> 00:11:25,316
Mark my word, Mal,

181
00:11:25,691 --> 00:11:30,618
someday, somehow,
that canine and his human will pay!

182
00:11:30,738 --> 00:11:33,662
I'm with ya there, May.

183
00:11:33,782 --> 00:11:35,705
They'll pay, all right.

184
00:11:36,869 --> 00:11:39,121
Uh, how much exactly
are we charging 'em?

185
00:11:40,371 --> 00:11:44,376
That should teach them to mess
with our egg supply, huh, old boy?

186
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,753
Eggs.

187
00:11:45,878 --> 00:11:48,756
Oh, no, not again.

188
00:11:48,838 --> 00:11:52,469
Buck up, boyo.

189
00:11:52,592 --> 00:11:56,313
Ah, looks like we've got one doozy
of a storm brewin'.

190
00:12:03,019 --> 00:12:06,820
So much for a peaceful meal.

191
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:10,153
- Whoa!
- Oh! Oh, nobody saw that one coming!

192
00:12:10,235 --> 00:12:11,828
- Whoa!
- Hang on, Carmello.

193
00:12:11,903 --> 00:12:15,453
Perhaps it would be wise
to move this soiree to the cave.

194
00:12:15,532 --> 00:12:18,626
Let's get moving.
This is going to be a nasty one.

195
00:12:18,701 --> 00:12:20,578
I'm with you on that call.

196
00:12:20,663 --> 00:12:23,166
And Mak, grab the pineapple!

197
00:12:28,336 --> 00:12:31,056
Like we really needed this pineapple.

198
00:12:32,466 --> 00:12:35,059
All hands on deck!

199
00:12:35,177 --> 00:12:37,429
Get them sails down!

200
00:12:37,513 --> 00:12:40,265
And secure the yardarms tight!

201
00:12:41,225 --> 00:12:42,772
Get yourself below, mate!

202
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:44,979
Best you ride out the storm there!

203
00:12:49,024 --> 00:12:50,240
Ah!

204
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:54,120
Oh!

205
00:13:10,546 --> 00:13:12,014
Ah! Aynsley!

206
00:13:12,673 --> 00:13:15,176
I got you!

207
00:13:20,556 --> 00:13:22,649
Oh!

208
00:13:22,725 --> 00:13:24,351
Hey! Hey!

209
00:13:25,351 --> 00:13:28,572
Help! Help!

210
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:35,327
Look out!

211
00:13:35,403 --> 00:13:37,201
- Runaway pineapple!
- Whoa!

212
00:13:37,322 --> 00:13:38,370
Oh!

213
00:13:44,245 --> 00:13:46,543
Sorry, Pango. Careful, Scrubby!

214
00:13:46,623 --> 00:13:49,842
- I got it! Whoa...
- Scrubby!

215
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:52,922
Help!

216
00:13:53,004 --> 00:13:55,474
Quick! Rosie, the tree!

217
00:13:56,091 --> 00:13:59,061
Easy, Scrubby, don't panic!

218
00:13:59,177 --> 00:14:01,054
OK, I got ya now!

219
00:14:01,554 --> 00:14:03,023
Well, come on, you old goat!

220
00:14:03,097 --> 00:14:06,226
Get your hooves moving!
We ain't got all day!

221
00:14:06,769 --> 00:14:10,148
That's it, easy.

222
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:13,200
Don't be afraid, one step at a time...

223
00:14:13,274 --> 00:14:14,743
Whoa...

224
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:15,951
Scrubby!

225
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,868
- Help!
- He's not going to make it!

226
00:14:17,946 --> 00:14:20,698
Do something! Carmello, grab him.

227
00:14:21,908 --> 00:14:23,411
I <i>got...</i>

228
00:14:23,494 --> 00:14:25,461
You!

229
00:14:28,289 --> 00:14:30,838
H-H-H-Help!

230
00:14:39,676 --> 00:14:42,679
Help! We're in here!

231
00:14:42,763 --> 00:14:44,639
Someone help!

232
00:14:45,515 --> 00:14:47,938
Help!

233
00:14:48,059 --> 00:14:50,278
Ah! Ah!

234
00:14:53,565 --> 00:14:54,817
Whoa...

235
00:14:58,278 --> 00:15:00,405
Oh...

236
00:15:08,371 --> 00:15:09,918
No, no. Ah!

237
00:15:10,039 --> 00:15:11,417
Away!

238
00:15:18,256 --> 00:15:22,057
Payback time!

239
00:15:24,638 --> 00:15:29,644
I can't hold on, Mello!
This is the end, little buddy.

240
00:15:29,725 --> 00:15:31,568
There's not much time!
They're gonna fall!

241
00:15:31,644 --> 00:15:34,818
Hold steady! I'm coming, mates!

242
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,073
Pango, what are you doing?

243
00:15:39,986 --> 00:15:41,113
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

244
00:15:42,197 --> 00:15:43,494
Whoa!

245
00:15:53,584 --> 00:15:55,130
How's it going, mate?

246
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:57,553
Nice try, Pango, but it's hopeless.

247
00:15:57,629 --> 00:15:59,096
I'm a goner.

248
00:15:59,173 --> 00:16:00,470
Mak!

249
00:16:01,466 --> 00:16:03,389
Oh! Hold on, hold on, hold on.

250
00:16:03,509 --> 00:16:04,601
<i>Oh.</i>

251
00:16:05,846 --> 00:16:07,438
Come on, come on, come on.

252
00:16:07,514 --> 00:16:09,187
I'll get you guys out of there!

253
00:16:09,265 --> 00:16:11,485
Ah! We have to do something!

254
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:12,812
- Oops!
- Oh, no.

255
00:16:12,894 --> 00:16:16,024
- Mak! Look out!
- Ouch!

256
00:16:16,523 --> 00:16:18,821
- Mak!
- Oh...

257
00:16:19,902 --> 00:16:21,995
This just went from bad to worse.

258
00:16:22,070 --> 00:16:26,166
Don't worry, guys,
that branch looks pretty solid to me.

259
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:29,495
Right, but how do we get down?

260
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:32,168
You got me there.

261
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,317
Oh, I can't believe it.

262
00:16:53,393 --> 00:16:54,985
They're alive!

263
00:16:55,062 --> 00:16:56,234
It's a miracle!

264
00:16:56,312 --> 00:16:59,783
Hey. anybody want some pineapple?

265
00:17:42,442 --> 00:17:45,286
Whoa, whoa! Did you hear that sound?

266
00:17:46,738 --> 00:17:49,991
- What's out there, Mak?
- I have no idea.

267
00:17:50,075 --> 00:17:52,794
I've never heard a sound
like that before.

268
00:17:52,868 --> 00:17:56,964
Can you see anything?

269
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,541
Not a thing.

270
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:02,422
Unfortunately, we're going to
have to wait until morning.

271
00:18:06,173 --> 00:18:10,644
Same old stuff. Shells and more shells.

272
00:18:11,596 --> 00:18:14,395
Small ones, big ones...

273
00:18:16,852 --> 00:18:18,273
That's a new taste.

274
00:18:18,353 --> 00:18:20,946
Earthy, with a slight touch of salt.

275
00:18:22,023 --> 00:18:25,198
Come on. Come to papa.

276
00:18:25,277 --> 00:18:27,153
Huh?

277
00:18:27,278 --> 00:18:29,326
Hey, Scrubs, what did you find?

278
00:18:29,489 --> 00:18:30,990
What is it you're eating?

279
00:18:31,074 --> 00:18:33,952
I don't know but it's delicious.

280
00:18:34,076 --> 00:18:35,545
Aw, Scrubs!

281
00:18:35,621 --> 00:18:37,419
You know I collect stuff like this.

282
00:18:38,707 --> 00:18:43,008
My nose tells me there's more goodies
up at Rocky Point.

283
00:18:44,587 --> 00:18:47,136
Look at that!

284
00:18:47,214 --> 00:18:49,343
Woolly c-c-caterpillars!

285
00:18:49,425 --> 00:18:51,427
See? I was right.

286
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:55,641
This is the most incredible proof
that there's another world out there!

287
00:18:55,723 --> 00:18:57,067
No.

288
00:18:57,142 --> 00:18:59,190
Look behind you.

289
00:18:59,269 --> 00:19:00,895
What are you talking about? Behind me?

290
00:19:00,979 --> 00:19:02,105
Ah!

291
00:19:02,230 --> 00:19:04,778
I can't believe it.

292
00:19:04,857 --> 00:19:07,656
It's the thing
we heard dying last night.

293
00:19:07,818 --> 00:19:09,240
What do you think it is?

294
00:19:09,363 --> 00:19:12,115
The other world.

295
00:19:12,199 --> 00:19:13,826
I've got to get a closer look.

296
00:19:13,909 --> 00:19:16,162
Mak, don't! We have no idea what it is.

297
00:19:16,286 --> 00:19:18,128
It's too dangerous, Mak!

298
00:19:19,122 --> 00:19:22,296
But this is amazing! I was right!

299
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,513
I knew it, I knew it. I knew it!

300
00:19:27,631 --> 00:19:31,556
This is from the other world!
I have never seen anything like this!

301
00:19:31,634 --> 00:19:33,682
Incredible!

302
00:19:58,912 --> 00:20:00,538
Huh?

303
00:20:06,211 --> 00:20:07,804
Ah!

304
00:20:17,888 --> 00:20:20,607
- Mak should be more careful.
- Pangy's right.

305
00:20:20,683 --> 00:20:22,936
We should keep our distance.

306
00:20:23,019 --> 00:20:25,942
What's going on?

307
00:20:26,105 --> 00:20:30,155
Easy now, whatever you are.

308
00:20:30,234 --> 00:20:32,407
I just want to talk.

309
00:20:37,366 --> 00:20:39,836
Sea monsters.

310
00:20:48,836 --> 00:20:51,339
Wow! Look at this.

311
00:20:51,423 --> 00:20:53,471
There's hardly any ship left, Aynsley.

312
00:20:54,468 --> 00:20:55,890
Hello!

313
00:20:55,969 --> 00:20:57,391
Is anyone out there?

314
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:01,066
- Hey! Can anyone hear me?
- Ooh. Look at it.

315
00:21:01,141 --> 00:21:02,893
Captain! Bosun!

316
00:21:02,976 --> 00:21:05,819
- Anyone?
- It's... hideous!

317
00:21:11,067 --> 00:21:12,865
Where did they all go?

318
00:21:12,986 --> 00:21:14,988
I can't believe everyone is really gone.

319
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:17,493
Looks like there's just the two of us.

320
00:21:17,615 --> 00:21:19,459
Let's go to shore.

321
00:21:20,535 --> 00:21:23,413
Hang on, Aynsley,
the current's really strong.

322
00:21:41,013 --> 00:21:42,435
Uh-oh.

323
00:21:47,479 --> 00:21:49,606
Oh, land, sweet land!

324
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:53,076
Oh. It's so good to be alive, Aynsley.

325
00:21:53,192 --> 00:21:56,992
Bob's your uncle,
sea monsters walking on land?

326
00:21:57,113 --> 00:22:00,116
Uh-oh, we're in big trouble.

327
00:22:00,241 --> 00:22:02,994
Only one thing has two legs.

328
00:22:03,077 --> 00:22:04,125
A bird!

329
00:22:04,203 --> 00:22:06,707
And that ain't no bird I've ever seen.

330
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:08,917
Yeah. He can't even fly.

331
00:22:25,016 --> 00:22:27,609
That monster is going to eat Carmello!

332
00:22:29,270 --> 00:22:30,817
What's going on, Aynsley?

333
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,200
We gotta do something, now!

334
00:22:33,275 --> 00:22:35,993
Hurry, make as much noise as you can.

335
00:22:36,068 --> 00:22:38,491
We have to scare those sea monsters off!

336
00:22:38,613 --> 00:22:39,990
Come back here, Aynsley!

337
00:22:40,115 --> 00:22:41,424
Stay close together.

338
00:22:41,449 --> 00:22:42,676
We don't know what's out there.

339
00:22:42,701 --> 00:22:44,749
What was that?

340
00:22:47,705 --> 00:22:49,924
Aynsley! Aynsley, what's that noise?

341
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:52,794
Ah! Cannibals, Aynsley, Cannibals!

342
00:22:52,877 --> 00:22:54,380
We have to get off this island!

343
00:22:54,461 --> 00:22:55,838
The sailor warned us.

344
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,433
They'll skin us alive and eat us!

345
00:22:59,509 --> 00:23:01,603
Hurry, old boy. They're coming for us!

346
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:05,557
Uh, get inside the barrel. Go, boy, go.

347
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,731
There. Yes.

348
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:10,361
Guys, guys, guys. What are you doing?

349
00:23:10,436 --> 00:23:13,316
Scaring off the sea monsters,
thank you very much.

350
00:23:13,397 --> 00:23:15,115
And what if they aren't sea monsters?

351
00:23:15,191 --> 00:23:17,192
Did you see the furry one's teeth?

352
00:23:17,277 --> 00:23:19,075
He'll rip us to shreds!

353
00:23:19,194 --> 00:23:22,118
Everybody calm down! We're safe here.

354
00:23:22,198 --> 00:23:23,244
Are we?

355
00:23:23,325 --> 00:23:25,748
We really don't know
what those creatures are capable of!

356
00:23:25,826 --> 00:23:28,625
I know one thing they're capable of,
leaving the island!

357
00:23:28,747 --> 00:23:29,919
What?

358
00:23:31,833 --> 00:23:35,554
Oh, no!
Come on, this can't be happening to me.

359
00:23:35,628 --> 00:23:37,972
He's actually leaving.

360
00:23:39,214 --> 00:23:42,469
We did it! We got rid of him.

361
00:23:42,551 --> 00:23:45,305
Yeah, we scared them big time!

362
00:23:45,387 --> 00:23:47,560
Will somebody tell me what's happening?

363
00:23:47,641 --> 00:23:49,268
I'll tell you what's going on.

364
00:23:49,351 --> 00:23:53,527
You guys have ruined my chance to
get off this island and see the world.

365
00:23:53,605 --> 00:23:55,448
You really don't get it, do you?

366
00:23:55,522 --> 00:23:59,073
You think this paradise.
Well, it is not!

367
00:23:59,152 --> 00:24:01,904
It meant so much to me.

368
00:24:06,785 --> 00:24:09,413
- He's back.
- Oh, no, here we go again.

369
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:13,459
Back? Are you serious? Let me see!

370
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:18,092
Here's what we're going to do.
We stay out of sight

371
00:24:18,171 --> 00:24:21,846
and we keep an eye on them,
see what they plan on doing. OK?

372
00:24:22,717 --> 00:24:24,013
OK, then.

373
00:24:24,134 --> 00:24:25,682
Nobody goes on the beach.

374
00:24:25,804 --> 00:24:27,646
That goes for you, too, Scrubby.

375
00:24:27,721 --> 00:24:30,144
Yeah, yeah. I heard ya.

376
00:24:31,684 --> 00:24:34,814
Didn't even get to finish my breakfast.

377
00:24:55,165 --> 00:24:58,510
All those new smells
are driving me crazy!

378
00:24:58,627 --> 00:25:00,425
I gotta go check it out.

379
00:25:00,505 --> 00:25:03,258
Where you going, Scrubby?

380
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:04,683
Psst! Come back.

381
00:25:04,759 --> 00:25:06,727
It's not safe out there.

382
00:25:07,636 --> 00:25:11,686
Can't let all those tasty morsels
get washed away.

383
00:25:12,142 --> 00:25:15,191
If I recall correctly, didn't Mak say
we should all stay out of sight?

384
00:25:15,269 --> 00:25:16,317
He did!

385
00:25:16,395 --> 00:25:19,194
Speaking of which, where is Mak?

386
00:25:24,570 --> 00:25:26,868
Sorry about today, old friend.

387
00:25:26,948 --> 00:25:29,371
That was a pretty inept attempt.

388
00:25:30,492 --> 00:25:32,415
Oh, what was I thinking?

389
00:25:32,494 --> 00:25:34,963
I haven't the foggiest idea
where we are,

390
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,423
nor, for that matter,

391
00:25:36,499 --> 00:25:39,719
the slightest inkling
in which direction to set sail.

392
00:25:40,545 --> 00:25:43,138
Someone's bound to come
and save us, old boy.

393
00:25:43,213 --> 00:25:44,965
I'm sure of it.

394
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:48,060
If those cannibals come back,
we'll be ready for them.

395
00:25:53,557 --> 00:25:55,026
Who's out there?

396
00:25:55,143 --> 00:25:56,565
Show yourselves!

397
00:25:57,644 --> 00:25:59,897
My dog'll tear you to shreds!

398
00:26:03,108 --> 00:26:04,986
And I have a musket!

399
00:26:05,111 --> 00:26:08,035
Huh? A goat?

400
00:26:08,114 --> 00:26:10,708
It's just a goat.

401
00:26:12,201 --> 00:26:14,500
And a bird.

402
00:26:14,578 --> 00:26:16,957
Maybe there aren't
any cannibals after all.

403
00:26:20,751 --> 00:26:23,631
Mak, what were you doing
out there all by yourself?

404
00:26:23,712 --> 00:26:25,313
I thought you said
we should stay hidden?

405
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:27,888
I was just checking things out is all.

406
00:26:27,967 --> 00:26:29,719
What's all the commotion about, anyway?

407
00:26:29,844 --> 00:26:32,221
Well, Epi just made a good point.

408
00:26:32,305 --> 00:26:35,275
I just suggested, hypothetically,

409
00:26:35,349 --> 00:26:38,729
that possibly the sea monster
lost that thingamajig you found.

410
00:26:38,811 --> 00:26:40,905
And maybe he's come to get it back!

411
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,481
Along with us!

412
00:26:43,148 --> 00:26:48,246
It's one of two things for sure,
a coincidence or a bad omen.

413
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,539
Either way, you need to get rid of it.

414
00:26:50,656 --> 00:26:53,000
Why not just give it back
to the sea monsters?

415
00:26:53,076 --> 00:26:54,201
Peachy idea.

416
00:26:54,285 --> 00:26:55,457
No way!

417
00:26:55,577 --> 00:26:58,126
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa...
- You're kidding?

418
00:26:58,248 --> 00:26:59,670
You're so selfish!

419
00:26:59,749 --> 00:27:01,296
Selfish?

420
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:03,924
OK. Uh, maybe.

421
00:27:04,045 --> 00:27:06,343
Just give me time to think about it.

422
00:27:06,463 --> 00:27:10,594
But if I do give it back,
you're all coming with me.

423
00:27:35,492 --> 00:27:38,622
Well. All right, then, Aynsley,

424
00:27:38,704 --> 00:27:40,798
we've got some work to do.

425
00:27:40,874 --> 00:27:44,595
Let's save whatever we can
before it is all lost to the sea.

426
00:27:55,971 --> 00:27:58,099
How's it looking, mate?

427
00:27:58,223 --> 00:28:00,146
They're taking over our beach.

428
00:28:00,268 --> 00:28:02,770
He's pulling strange stuff
out from the sea.

429
00:28:02,854 --> 00:28:06,199
I suppose this means
they're not leaving any time soon, then?

430
00:28:06,273 --> 00:28:07,445
Looks that way.

431
00:28:19,787 --> 00:28:22,665
Do you see how
the four-legged one sleeps all day

432
00:28:22,749 --> 00:28:24,717
while the big one does the work?

433
00:28:24,834 --> 00:28:27,586
No, but I'll take your word for it.

434
00:28:27,670 --> 00:28:30,013
I'll bet ya
the sleeping one's the boss.

435
00:28:39,265 --> 00:28:43,441
Look, he stripped off his skin!

436
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:46,064
Ugh, I'm going to be sick.

437
00:28:52,737 --> 00:28:54,955
<i>None of us knew it at the time,</i>

438
00:28:55,030 --> 00:29:00,127
<i>but we were being watched
by the real monsters on the island.</i>

439
00:29:09,002 --> 00:29:10,471
Some luck, huh, May?

440
00:29:10,587 --> 00:29:14,218
That green-gilled human
and his mangy mutt made it safely here.

441
00:29:14,342 --> 00:29:15,763
How are we gonna deal with him?

442
00:29:15,843 --> 00:29:17,766
He might be a problem for us.

443
00:29:17,845 --> 00:29:19,017
Don't you worry.

444
00:29:19,137 --> 00:29:22,061
I'll figure out a way
to get rid of them quick enough.

445
00:29:22,182 --> 00:29:26,313
For the time being,
we sit, watch and wait.

446
00:29:26,395 --> 00:29:31,152
Aw, come on, May, I'm starving here.

447
00:29:31,233 --> 00:29:33,782
And what did I just say?

448
00:29:34,737 --> 00:29:38,537
Sit. Watch. Wait.

449
00:29:39,075 --> 00:29:41,874
That's right. Now, stay focused!

450
00:29:41,994 --> 00:29:46,000
We've got the upper claw.
No one knows we're here.

451
00:29:46,124 --> 00:29:49,219
Which means we take our time

452
00:29:49,626 --> 00:29:54,848
and we pick them off one by one.

453
00:30:06,184 --> 00:30:07,982
Ah, look, Aynsley!

454
00:30:08,061 --> 00:30:10,109
These could come in very handy.

455
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,356
I'd better practice a bit

456
00:30:11,441 --> 00:30:14,661
before we venture out there
to get our dinner, right, boy?

457
00:30:16,362 --> 00:30:19,457
<i>♪ I ply my trade from the Union Jack</i>

458
00:30:19,531 --> 00:30:22,035
<i>♪ Upon the seven seas</i>

459
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:25,084
<i>♪ Unless I eat some rancid meat</i>

460
00:30:25,163 --> 00:30:28,258
<i>♪ Bury me soul with mermaid, please' ♪</i>

461
00:30:32,252 --> 00:30:33,424
Steady...

462
00:30:34,838 --> 00:30:36,715
- What's he doing?
- Shh.

463
00:30:36,798 --> 00:30:39,643
Pull back the hammer and...

464
00:30:44,473 --> 00:30:46,476
I don't know about you, Scrubby,

465
00:30:46,558 --> 00:30:50,108
but I plan on staying as far away
from that monster <i>as</i> possible.

466
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:52,948
What was that all about?

467
00:30:53,023 --> 00:30:55,777
I have absolutely no idea.

468
00:30:55,859 --> 00:30:59,454
But what we need to find out is
what these newcomer's intentions are.

469
00:30:59,572 --> 00:31:02,415
From the sound of it,
they're up to no good.

470
00:31:02,491 --> 00:31:04,493
Obviously they're trying to kill us.

471
00:31:04,576 --> 00:31:06,045
Maybe. But maybe not.

472
00:31:06,162 --> 00:31:07,413
The truth of the matter is

473
00:31:07,497 --> 00:31:12,094
that these newcomers have brought
nothing but trouble to our paradise.

474
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,757
That is a fact.

475
00:31:13,836 --> 00:31:17,715
Fine. Then do like I asked
and stay out of sight.

476
00:31:17,798 --> 00:31:20,051
They're proof that
there's another world out there

477
00:31:20,134 --> 00:31:22,886
and I'm going to find out
whether they're friend or foe.

478
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:25,597
You really don't get it, do you?

479
00:31:44,325 --> 00:31:46,248
Whoa!

480
00:31:47,662 --> 00:31:49,209
That was close.

481
00:31:50,123 --> 00:31:54,469
OK, let's give this a go
one last time.

482
00:31:58,213 --> 00:32:00,467
Ah! Did you see that, Aynsley?

483
00:32:00,549 --> 00:32:02,894
I did it! I hit the mark!

484
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:07,394
Let's go fix something to eat, old boy.

485
00:32:07,557 --> 00:32:09,785
That was a miracle,
I never thought I'd hit it!

486
00:32:09,808 --> 00:32:12,561
Well, maybe we'll eat
something after all.

487
00:32:13,855 --> 00:32:17,233
<i>I was starting to wonder
if everyone wasn't right.</i>

488
00:32:17,357 --> 00:32:19,155
<i>The new world was finally here</i>

489
00:32:19,234 --> 00:32:22,579
<i>and I had no idea
if I was ready for it or not.</i>

490
00:32:32,038 --> 00:32:36,009
Mmm...
That's the biggest rat I've ever seen.

491
00:32:36,126 --> 00:32:38,755
Go for the throat,
let's make this quick.

492
00:32:38,880 --> 00:32:40,132
Wait, the human!

493
00:33:05,865 --> 00:33:07,663
Oh, I can't do it, boy.

494
00:33:07,741 --> 00:33:09,914
Go on! Shoo! Go!

495
00:33:11,453 --> 00:33:12,797
What now?

496
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:18,760
Sorry, pal,
I've never shot anything before.

497
00:33:18,836 --> 00:33:20,679
What say we try fishing?

498
00:33:22,423 --> 00:33:24,266
What's burning?

499
00:33:25,634 --> 00:33:26,682
U-

500
00:33:26,801 --> 00:33:29,020
That would be me.

501
00:33:29,971 --> 00:33:32,099
You smell like burnt biscuits.

502
00:33:32,182 --> 00:33:34,402
Shh! Something's coming.

503
00:33:39,648 --> 00:33:41,151
Looks like Rosie was here.

504
00:33:41,275 --> 00:33:44,153
That's strange,
Rosie never leaves any food behind.

505
00:33:44,237 --> 00:33:45,704
Oh!

506
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:49,082
Oh, no.

507
00:33:51,868 --> 00:33:56,170
Would you prefer white
or dark meat for brunch, darling?

508
00:33:56,249 --> 00:33:57,625
I prefer... Dog!

509
00:33:57,708 --> 00:34:00,131
Time to get even, ratter!

510
00:34:09,844 --> 00:34:11,688
Hold on, Aynsley! I'm coming!

511
00:34:11,764 --> 00:34:15,485
Those blasted ratters,
they did survive after all!

512
00:34:17,269 --> 00:34:19,112
Ah, I'm hit!

513
00:34:19,188 --> 00:34:20,565
Run for it!

514
00:34:25,068 --> 00:34:26,786
Good dog.

515
00:34:26,862 --> 00:34:28,329
You all right, old boy?

516
00:34:29,864 --> 00:34:31,036
Did you hear that?

517
00:34:31,951 --> 00:34:33,293
Over there.

518
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:36,418
Oh, look, it's a bird,
a beautiful parrot.

519
00:34:36,496 --> 00:34:38,498
So, Aynsley,

520
00:34:38,623 --> 00:34:40,672
that's what all the fuss was about.

521
00:34:40,751 --> 00:34:43,755
Those ratters were after the bird.
You've done good, old boy.

522
00:34:44,297 --> 00:34:45,719
And you...

523
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,559
We're going to fix you up straight away.

524
00:34:50,427 --> 00:34:52,521
Look, Aynsley, a ring!

525
00:34:52,597 --> 00:34:54,599
That can only mean one thing.

526
00:34:54,681 --> 00:34:56,980
Sailors have set foot
on this island before.

527
00:34:57,101 --> 00:34:59,523
I believe there's hope for us after all.

528
00:35:04,942 --> 00:35:07,161
You can come out guys,
there's no one around.

529
00:35:07,277 --> 00:35:09,871
It's too dark,
I can't see a thing.

530
00:35:11,282 --> 00:35:15,458
This is the very spot
where that sea monster attacked me.

531
00:35:15,536 --> 00:35:17,630
Well, sort of.

532
00:35:20,583 --> 00:35:22,835
<i>Oh, are muse...</i>

533
00:35:22,918 --> 00:35:25,045
We shouldn't have let him go alone.

534
00:35:25,128 --> 00:35:27,222
Maybe he's moulting.

535
00:35:27,297 --> 00:35:30,222
Oh, that's a bit of a stretch, Pango.

536
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:33,474
Just wait till I get my hooves on them.

537
00:35:33,554 --> 00:35:37,353
Any way you look at it,
this is not good.

538
00:35:38,266 --> 00:35:39,813
Mak can't be gone.

539
00:35:39,893 --> 00:35:41,987
What's that?

540
00:35:42,438 --> 00:35:44,405
And who are you two?

541
00:35:44,481 --> 00:35:46,780
Just two homeless castaways.

542
00:35:46,858 --> 00:35:49,612
We were held captive by that human
for months

543
00:35:49,695 --> 00:35:53,244
with nothing to eat
but the crumbs from his table.

544
00:35:53,324 --> 00:35:56,748
What about our friend?
Did you see him, by any chance?

545
00:35:57,661 --> 00:36:00,791
Oh, 'tis a true tragedy, all right.

546
00:36:00,914 --> 00:36:05,590
Oh, an unfortunate turn of events.
You see, we caused...

547
00:36:08,130 --> 00:36:11,929
We saw the whole thing.

548
00:36:12,009 --> 00:36:15,934
Well, come on, let's hear it.
What are you waiting for?

549
00:36:16,054 --> 00:36:18,148
We'll tell you
what happened to your friend

550
00:36:18,264 --> 00:36:22,110
but I'm warning ya, it ain't pretty.

551
00:36:22,186 --> 00:36:25,860
You see, the human loves to eat birds

552
00:36:25,981 --> 00:36:27,858
and I am afraid your friend got...

553
00:36:28,693 --> 00:36:30,570
Trapped.

554
00:36:30,652 --> 00:36:31,949
Mmm-hmm.

555
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:40,838
This should only take a minute.

556
00:36:40,954 --> 00:36:43,208
It's just dislocated.

557
00:36:43,289 --> 00:36:45,634
But it's going to hurt a bit...

558
00:36:47,001 --> 00:36:49,755
Don't worry,
you'll feel better in a day or two,

559
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:52,132
though you won't be able
to fly right away.

560
00:36:52,215 --> 00:36:53,432
Well, then,

561
00:36:53,509 --> 00:36:56,682
I suppose you'll need a name if
you're going to stay here for a while.

562
00:36:56,762 --> 00:36:57,978
Let's see.

563
00:36:58,097 --> 00:37:00,599
By my reckoning, today's Tuesday.

564
00:37:00,682 --> 00:37:02,650
That's as good a name as any, eh?

565
00:37:02,726 --> 00:37:04,570
Can you say Tuesday?

566
00:37:05,311 --> 00:37:06,780
Tuesday?

567
00:37:10,358 --> 00:37:13,362
Well, not quit. But that's a start.

568
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:17,454
Take care of our new friend, boy.

569
00:37:17,532 --> 00:37:19,706
I'd better offload
as much stuff as I can.

570
00:37:19,784 --> 00:37:23,539
No telling how long
the ship will stay in one piece.

571
00:37:36,969 --> 00:37:39,347
They're nothing but cannibals!

572
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:40,806
Murderers!

573
00:37:40,931 --> 00:37:44,525
I say we run 'em off our island!

574
00:37:44,601 --> 00:37:47,195
Drive them monsters back into the sea!

575
00:37:47,271 --> 00:37:51,992
Perhaps a plan might be to force them
to live on Curse Island!

576
00:37:52,108 --> 00:37:54,157
Yeah! Oh, yes, yes, yes!

577
00:37:54,235 --> 00:37:56,079
Curse Island!

578
00:37:56,155 --> 00:37:59,375
Uh, what exactly is Curse Island?

579
00:37:59,449 --> 00:38:01,748
Ooh! The end of the earth, mate.

580
00:38:01,869 --> 00:38:03,836
No one's ever made it back from there.

581
00:38:03,996 --> 00:38:06,590
Yeah. There's nothing there but bugs.

582
00:38:06,664 --> 00:38:10,043
Lots and lots of nasty bugs.

583
00:38:10,126 --> 00:38:13,050
Sounds perfect.

584
00:38:13,172 --> 00:38:15,925
Drive them to Curse Island.

585
00:38:16,007 --> 00:38:17,510
That's not going to work.

586
00:38:17,592 --> 00:38:20,061
You have a better idea?

587
00:38:20,137 --> 00:38:22,264
Uh, no.

588
00:38:23,306 --> 00:38:26,686
Right. So, then, where were we?

589
00:38:30,396 --> 00:38:32,695
Stop your flapping about, bird.

590
00:38:32,775 --> 00:38:35,527
You need to be resting
that wing of yours.

591
00:38:35,652 --> 00:38:37,905
What do you want from me?

592
00:38:37,987 --> 00:38:39,581
I just want to talk.

593
00:38:39,657 --> 00:38:41,159
The name's Aynsley,

594
00:38:41,242 --> 00:38:44,996
and from what I understand,
yours is Tuesday.

595
00:38:45,161 --> 00:38:47,460
Call me whatever you want,
except dinner.

596
00:38:47,539 --> 00:38:50,713
Dinner? We're not going to eat you.

597
00:38:50,835 --> 00:38:52,336
We saved your life!

598
00:38:52,418 --> 00:38:55,262
Either way,
you'll not make much of a meal.

599
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:58,554
Not like the fat, juicy turkeys
we have back home.

600
00:38:58,634 --> 00:39:02,559
Relax, my master likes you.

601
00:39:02,637 --> 00:39:05,231
You said your master?

602
00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:07,067
You did not think that I...

603
00:39:08,726 --> 00:39:11,355
Oh, I like you. You're funny.

604
00:39:11,438 --> 00:39:14,112
I've never seen a bird like you
in England.

605
00:39:14,190 --> 00:39:17,490
Eng-land. Tell me more, Aynsley.

606
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:18,827
Aye, laddie.

607
00:39:18,903 --> 00:39:21,157
England, my island,

608
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:24,994
just one fantastic place
in a sea of many lands.

609
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,496
I knew it!

610
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:30,583
Crusoe wants to explore them all.
If we ever get off this one.

611
00:39:30,708 --> 00:39:33,257
You know, you're the first to come
from the outside world.

612
00:39:33,335 --> 00:39:36,713
Oh, dear, that's not good news.

613
00:39:45,264 --> 00:39:47,391
Uh, hold on a second.

614
00:39:47,474 --> 00:39:50,226
We're made up like this because...

615
00:39:50,311 --> 00:39:52,608
Because you look fierce.

616
00:39:52,688 --> 00:39:55,065
Now, get your heads
in the game, everyone!

617
00:39:57,108 --> 00:39:59,237
We have the perfect opportunity.

618
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:01,539
The dog and that bird
are still on the ship.

619
00:40:01,614 --> 00:40:02,661
<i>Right.</i>

620
00:40:03,407 --> 00:40:05,909
Listen up! Here's the plan.

621
00:40:05,992 --> 00:40:08,621
We'll deal with the hairy beast
on the ship.

622
00:40:08,704 --> 00:40:13,505
The rest of you
go for the human on the beach.

623
00:40:13,626 --> 00:40:15,503
What's a ship?

624
00:40:15,585 --> 00:40:17,929
That wooden thing on the beach.

625
00:40:19,130 --> 00:40:20,724
As soon as we're on the ship,

626
00:40:20,798 --> 00:40:23,597
the wooden thing, you attack!

627
00:40:23,677 --> 00:40:26,054
Right, then. Fierce, fierce, fierce.

628
00:40:27,514 --> 00:40:30,016
So, I'm a fierce coconut?

629
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:54,253
I should go tell my friends
that I'm OK.

630
00:40:54,333 --> 00:40:57,507
You'd better stay put,
you're in no condition to fly.

631
00:40:57,585 --> 00:41:00,338
Well, look at this.

632
00:41:00,422 --> 00:41:03,391
We can kill two birds with one stone.

633
00:41:04,342 --> 00:41:06,721
Hmm? There's two birds now?

634
00:41:06,844 --> 00:41:09,313
Oh, shut it! Just follow my lead.

635
00:41:13,476 --> 00:41:15,900
Look, look! That tail feather.

636
00:41:16,021 --> 00:41:18,023
He's wearing Mak like a trophy!

637
00:41:18,148 --> 00:41:20,650
That is so wrong!

638
00:41:21,235 --> 00:41:22,827
Attack! Let's get him!

639
00:41:33,579 --> 00:41:35,297
Whoa...

640
00:41:37,041 --> 00:41:38,965
Yee-haw!

641
00:41:42,755 --> 00:41:44,599
Whoa!

642
00:41:48,512 --> 00:41:50,389
Whoa!

643
00:41:50,472 --> 00:41:51,563
Aysnley, we'd better go.

644
00:41:51,681 --> 00:41:54,356
What's going on out there?
They've all gone mad.

645
00:41:54,476 --> 00:41:56,695
- Ah!
- It appears as if your friends

646
00:41:56,769 --> 00:41:59,568
- have come to avenge your death.
- I'm not dead.

647
00:41:59,648 --> 00:42:02,902
Oh, we're going to
take care of that right now!

648
00:42:02,985 --> 00:42:05,454
Aynsley! Help!

649
00:42:05,528 --> 00:42:07,873
I have had it with you!

650
00:42:14,788 --> 00:42:16,664
Ah!

651
00:42:26,675 --> 00:42:28,143
Aynsley!

652
00:42:33,514 --> 00:42:34,686
Whoa...

653
00:42:41,481 --> 00:42:42,949
Come on down, then!

654
00:42:44,443 --> 00:42:45,695
Get off me!

655
00:42:45,777 --> 00:42:46,824
Aynsley!

656
00:42:57,581 --> 00:42:58,706
Tuesday?

657
00:43:05,672 --> 00:43:08,300
- Hold on! That sounded like...
- Mak!

658
00:43:08,382 --> 00:43:09,679
Aynsley!

659
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:11,762
Mak, get out!

660
00:43:11,844 --> 00:43:13,688
Kiki!

661
00:43:13,806 --> 00:43:15,057
Mak.

662
00:43:15,181 --> 00:43:16,353
I'm coming, boy!!!

663
00:43:19,228 --> 00:43:20,650
Rotten cats!

664
00:43:21,646 --> 00:43:23,570
You're to blame for all this!

665
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:26,239
You must leave the ship now.

666
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,407
Go!

667
00:43:32,074 --> 00:43:33,996
- Aynsley!
- Go!

668
00:43:42,291 --> 00:43:43,463
What's happening here?

669
00:43:43,543 --> 00:43:44,920
I thought Mak was dead.

670
00:43:45,003 --> 00:43:47,552
We all did,
but I don't think he made it this time.

671
00:43:47,672 --> 00:43:49,596
That would be horrible!

672
00:43:49,715 --> 00:43:52,594
Come on, guys,
we'd better move back now.

673
00:43:54,847 --> 00:43:57,396
Oh, no! Aynsley.

674
00:43:57,516 --> 00:43:59,108
What have I done'?

675
00:44:04,898 --> 00:44:07,742
Land.

676
00:44:07,818 --> 00:44:10,661
Land! We're saved, May!

677
00:44:10,737 --> 00:44:13,114
I thought we were goners.

678
00:44:13,197 --> 00:44:16,577
Oh, will you just shut up?

679
00:44:16,659 --> 00:44:19,038
What's that noise?

680
00:44:19,121 --> 00:44:21,543
- That would be bugs.
- Bugs!

681
00:44:21,623 --> 00:44:24,126
Curse Island!

682
00:44:49,108 --> 00:44:51,032
Rest in peace, old boy.

683
00:45:01,246 --> 00:45:02,748
Tuesday!

684
00:45:31,318 --> 00:45:32,614
Psst! Mak!

685
00:45:33,862 --> 00:45:35,704
Kiki!

686
00:45:35,947 --> 00:45:38,701
- Mak, you're hurt.
- I'll be OK.

687
00:45:38,784 --> 00:45:40,581
I'm sure glad to see you.

688
00:45:40,661 --> 00:45:42,538
- I was worried!
- Me, too.

689
00:45:42,621 --> 00:45:45,123
Come on, now's your chance to get away.

690
00:45:45,206 --> 00:45:47,083
- I can't.
- Let me help you.

691
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:51,637
No, no... I... I just...
I don't want to get away.

692
00:45:51,713 --> 00:45:52,760
What?

693
00:45:52,838 --> 00:45:55,762
You don't understand.
It's all those cats' fault.

694
00:45:55,884 --> 00:45:58,512
- What do you mean?
- They attacked me.

695
00:45:58,594 --> 00:46:00,313
He fixed my wing.

696
00:46:00,389 --> 00:46:04,565
And his dog gave his life to save me.
I can't leave him now.

697
00:46:04,643 --> 00:46:09,364
Oh, I see.
So, he's going to take care of you?

698
00:46:09,438 --> 00:46:12,612
Look, he's going to
need my help to survive.

699
00:46:12,693 --> 00:46:13,739
I owe him that.

700
00:46:13,818 --> 00:46:16,413
Exactly how do you plan on doing that?

701
00:46:16,487 --> 00:46:17,864
I mean, look at him!

702
00:46:25,289 --> 00:46:28,418
Tuesday, help!

703
00:46:31,335 --> 00:46:33,009
I don't believe it.

704
00:46:33,088 --> 00:46:37,264
Those cats used us and Mak as well
and what do we do?

705
00:46:37,342 --> 00:46:38,684
We attack the human.

706
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:40,478
Hold on, then.

707
00:46:40,594 --> 00:46:44,599
So what you're saying is
Kiki's to blame for all this?

708
00:46:44,682 --> 00:46:46,856
- Oh, afraid so!
- That's not fair.

709
00:46:46,934 --> 00:46:49,358
We all thought Mak was dead. Didn't we?

710
00:46:49,438 --> 00:46:51,315
Oh, this is not good, mates.

711
00:46:51,398 --> 00:46:54,367
Yeah. We've made a real mess of things.

712
00:46:54,525 --> 00:46:56,119
Ah, it looks that way, Epi, gal.

713
00:46:56,235 --> 00:46:57,737
Where you going, Rosie?

714
00:46:57,820 --> 00:46:59,539
Off to clean up our mess!

715
00:46:59,614 --> 00:47:00,706
I'm in.

716
00:47:00,824 --> 00:47:02,621
Well, let's get cracking then, mates!

717
00:47:02,701 --> 00:47:04,168
Wait a second!

718
00:47:04,244 --> 00:47:08,465
You're going to make
an even bigger mess of things.

719
00:47:15,630 --> 00:47:17,882
The wild beasts!
They're going to get us!

720
00:47:52,541 --> 00:47:54,135
Stay right where you are.

721
00:47:56,838 --> 00:47:58,438
I've got a special treat for all of you.

722
00:47:59,382 --> 00:48:00,599
<i>Oh.</i>

723
00:48:02,094 --> 00:48:04,347
I just want to
give you some biscuits is all.

724
00:48:05,931 --> 00:48:07,148
They're quite good.

725
00:48:18,860 --> 00:48:21,704
I finished off your dog, human,

726
00:48:21,822 --> 00:48:25,371
and I promise, one day,

727
00:48:25,449 --> 00:48:30,047
you and the rest of your lot
will join him.

728
00:48:33,333 --> 00:48:37,884
Now, that is the taste of desperation.

729
00:48:37,963 --> 00:48:41,762
Try the red ones.
They taste just like chicken. Mmm!

730
00:49:03,447 --> 00:49:04,994
What... What?

731
00:49:05,072 --> 00:49:06,619
Do you want to show me something?

732
00:49:06,740 --> 00:49:08,708
All right. All right, let's go.

733
00:49:12,496 --> 00:49:14,920
Oh, Tuesday,

734
00:49:15,041 --> 00:49:18,010
this is fantastic!

735
00:49:18,085 --> 00:49:19,713
Fresh water!

736
00:49:20,463 --> 00:49:21,556
Good job, Tuesday.

737
00:49:26,594 --> 00:49:29,347
What? You want me to follow you?

738
00:49:29,472 --> 00:49:31,271
OK, I'm coming.

739
00:49:34,351 --> 00:49:36,445
Hey, guys, look who's here.

740
00:49:44,112 --> 00:49:45,909
Relax, there's nothing to be afraid of.

741
00:49:46,864 --> 00:49:49,835
Stay right where you are.
I'll be right back.

742
00:49:51,411 --> 00:49:52,458
What got into him?

743
00:49:52,536 --> 00:49:55,005
- Why is he running away?
- Beats me.

744
00:49:55,081 --> 00:49:57,253
- Maybe it's your smell.
- Huh?

745
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,887
Try one of these, it's really good.

746
00:50:15,936 --> 00:50:17,653
And some for you. Enjoy!

747
00:50:28,155 --> 00:50:30,123
Say, Tuesday, where is pretty bird?

748
00:50:30,242 --> 00:50:31,414
I haven't seen her yet.

749
00:50:31,534 --> 00:50:34,003
Pretty bird!

750
00:50:34,079 --> 00:50:38,380
No need to yell, Mak,
I mean, Tuesday. I'm right here.

751
00:50:38,458 --> 00:50:42,338
There you are, pretty bird.
Here, you see? I won't hurt you.

752
00:50:42,461 --> 00:50:43,713
Come on, don't be afraid.

753
00:50:43,797 --> 00:50:45,719
Come on, pretty bird.

754
00:50:45,840 --> 00:50:47,387
Ouch!

755
00:50:48,677 --> 00:50:50,804
Well, friendships aren't made in a day.

756
00:50:50,887 --> 00:50:53,264
We'll take it one step
at a time, right, Tuesday?

757
00:50:53,347 --> 00:50:55,021
One step.

758
00:51:00,563 --> 00:51:02,190
I can't, May.

759
00:51:02,273 --> 00:51:03,992
The current's too strong.

760
00:51:04,067 --> 00:51:07,492
- So you failed again, did you?
- Oh...

761
00:51:11,157 --> 00:51:14,411
Oh, stop feeling sorry for yourself.

762
00:51:14,536 --> 00:51:17,005
Our time will come.

763
00:51:17,079 --> 00:51:20,675
Soon there will be more of us.

764
00:51:20,791 --> 00:51:23,715
Revenge will be sweet.

765
00:51:23,836 --> 00:51:25,179
Oh!

766
00:51:34,889 --> 00:51:36,516
Ah!

767
00:51:49,820 --> 00:51:51,494
Oh! That hurt.

768
00:51:51,614 --> 00:51:55,414
Why, you can't see a bloody thing,
can you, you old goat?

769
00:51:56,786 --> 00:51:58,914
We're going to have to fix that.

770
00:51:59,039 --> 00:52:01,588
There you are. That should help.

771
00:52:07,547 --> 00:52:09,219
Whoo-hoo!

772
00:52:09,298 --> 00:52:12,302
Why, Rosie, you're no pig.

773
00:52:12,385 --> 00:52:14,262
Hey! What's gotten into you?

774
00:52:14,346 --> 00:52:16,347
You're gorgeous!

775
00:52:16,431 --> 00:52:18,148
Easy. big boy.

776
00:52:21,186 --> 00:52:23,108
Whoo! Oh! Ow!

777
00:52:23,188 --> 00:52:26,032
Oh. Oh, no! Whoa!

778
00:52:26,106 --> 00:52:27,780
No, no, no, no, no! No, no. Ah!

779
00:52:27,858 --> 00:52:29,327
Oh!

780
00:52:30,277 --> 00:52:32,405
No. Oh, no!

781
00:52:32,489 --> 00:52:34,617
Tuesday, help!

782
00:52:34,699 --> 00:52:36,666
Hey. guys!

783
00:52:43,583 --> 00:52:45,630
Oh, never mind.

784
00:52:45,710 --> 00:52:46,802
This is hopeless.

785
00:52:50,507 --> 00:52:53,681
How am I ever going to survive
on this island?

786
00:53:00,766 --> 00:53:02,894
Yes, of course, that's it!

787
00:53:03,936 --> 00:53:06,565
I have to build a treehouse.

788
00:53:06,690 --> 00:53:07,942
Ha-ha!

789
00:53:20,411 --> 00:53:23,255
It's raining tree limbs.

790
00:53:23,331 --> 00:53:24,673
Ooh.

791
00:53:24,748 --> 00:53:27,672
Hmm, tastes good enough to eat.

792
00:53:27,793 --> 00:53:29,670
Is there anything you wouldn't eat?

793
00:53:29,753 --> 00:53:31,552
Hey, Pango. What's he doing?

794
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:36,010
Don't know, mate.
This cobber's gone b-b-bonkers on us.

795
00:53:36,094 --> 00:53:38,722
He's destroying the tree!

796
00:53:39,304 --> 00:53:41,398
Must keep sawing...

797
00:53:41,516 --> 00:53:43,483
Need to finish shelter.

798
00:53:43,643 --> 00:53:45,485
Must build...

799
00:53:45,603 --> 00:53:46,775
<i>Mmm.</i>

800
00:53:46,855 --> 00:53:49,608
Ah! Yes, sir. More porridge, please.

801
00:53:52,693 --> 00:53:55,288
<i>We had no clue
what Crusoe was up to.</i>

802
00:53:55,362 --> 00:53:57,239
<i>Sawing? Porridge?</i>

803
00:53:57,364 --> 00:54:02,086
<i>Yep, as Pango would say,
he was bonkers to the max.</i>

804
00:54:05,581 --> 00:54:07,960
How are you coming along, May?

805
00:54:08,041 --> 00:54:10,920
Can I have just a little a peek'?

806
00:54:11,045 --> 00:54:13,764
Can you just wait?
I'm cleaning them up.

807
00:54:13,882 --> 00:54:17,603
Well, could you at least tell me
how big a litter we have?

808
00:54:17,719 --> 00:54:21,474
More than we'll ever be
able to feed, I'm afraid.

809
00:54:25,434 --> 00:54:27,608
Oh, look at it...

810
00:54:27,728 --> 00:54:29,902
Hey!

811
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:41,083
Ow!

812
00:54:42,702 --> 00:54:44,079
That smarts.

813
00:54:44,204 --> 00:54:47,503
I'm trying to work here.
Go eat somewhere else.

814
00:54:47,581 --> 00:54:50,130
At this rate, I'll never get this built.

815
00:54:50,210 --> 00:54:52,554
<i>I</i> told you, go!

816
00:54:52,670 --> 00:54:55,139
Ah, never mind.

817
00:54:55,215 --> 00:54:58,139
What I wouldn't give
for an extra set of hands.

818
00:54:59,427 --> 00:55:01,976
<i>For all his pounding and sawing,</i>

819
00:55:02,137 --> 00:55:05,358
<i>we couldn't figure out
what he was actually doing.</i>

820
00:55:06,726 --> 00:55:09,445
Whoa! Now what is going on?

821
00:55:09,561 --> 00:55:11,188
Argh, really?

822
00:55:11,313 --> 00:55:13,032
<i>I couldn't blame Rosie.</i>

823
00:55:13,106 --> 00:55:15,701
<i>When you've got an itch,
you've gotta scratch it!</i>

824
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:18,534
<i>But poor Crusoe,
he didn't see it that way.</i>

825
00:55:18,612 --> 00:55:20,114
<i>He had had enough.</i>

826
00:55:20,824 --> 00:55:23,623
<i>And that's when it hit me! A nest!</i>

827
00:55:24,869 --> 00:55:26,541
- Mmm-mmm.
- Hey, guys!

828
00:55:26,621 --> 00:55:27,820
I figured out what he's doing.

829
00:55:27,914 --> 00:55:29,632
Uh, making a mess?

830
00:55:29,706 --> 00:55:31,755
No. He's building a shelter!

831
00:55:31,876 --> 00:55:33,378
Huh? Don't follow ya, mate.

832
00:55:33,503 --> 00:55:34,755
He's building a nest!

833
00:55:34,920 --> 00:55:37,594
- A nest?
- So he is a bird.

834
00:55:37,715 --> 00:55:42,221
Scrubs. He's building
a human nest in the tree!

835
00:55:42,302 --> 00:55:45,306
Oh! Pretty clever!

836
00:55:45,389 --> 00:55:48,393
I've never slept in a tree.

837
00:55:48,476 --> 00:55:51,400
If he stocks it with food,
you'll sleep in a tree.

838
00:55:51,478 --> 00:55:52,570
Good point!

839
00:55:52,646 --> 00:55:54,865
So, guys, I got an idea.

840
00:55:54,940 --> 00:55:58,786
What do ya say we help him out,
get this nest of his built?

841
00:55:58,945 --> 00:56:03,621
I must have been crazy thinking
I could build this all by my... self.

842
00:56:05,451 --> 00:56:08,204
<i>We didn't really have
any idea what we were getting into.</i>

843
00:56:08,288 --> 00:56:09,960
<i>We just figured let's help,</i>

844
00:56:10,039 --> 00:56:12,838
<i>use whatever abilities we had
and hoped it all worked.</i>

845
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:16,588
Well, I'll be gobsmacked!

846
00:56:18,755 --> 00:56:20,632
Slowly, slowly.

847
00:56:20,757 --> 00:56:23,978
Slowly, slowly.

848
00:56:24,052 --> 00:56:25,804
That's it, just a little more.

849
00:56:27,764 --> 00:56:31,235
Hi, Epi! Where are you headed
with all that food?

850
00:56:34,188 --> 00:56:37,862
Whoa! I need a little help here, guys!

851
00:56:37,942 --> 00:56:39,568
- Easy.
- Hmm, salty.

852
00:56:39,652 --> 00:56:42,074
Not that kind of help.
No, no. That tickles!

853
00:56:43,072 --> 00:56:46,246
Epi, hold up. I'm starving!

854
00:56:46,326 --> 00:56:47,668
Whoa!

855
00:56:47,744 --> 00:56:49,041
Help!

856
00:56:50,246 --> 00:56:52,293
<i>Things didn't
always go smoothly.</i>

857
00:56:52,373 --> 00:56:55,672
<i>And we had our ups and downs,
that's for sure.</i>

858
00:56:55,751 --> 00:56:58,175
<i>But everyone was in fine spirits.</i>

859
00:56:58,253 --> 00:57:01,849
<i>And Crusoe seemed, well, happy.</i>

860
00:57:01,925 --> 00:57:05,724
<i>He made a funny little door for Epi
and Pango to get into the nest.</i>

861
00:57:05,887 --> 00:57:07,764
<i>It was a pretty good idea.</i>

862
00:57:08,972 --> 00:57:11,521
<i>After a few modifications, that is.</i>

863
00:57:16,063 --> 00:57:17,940
<i>We became a real team,</i>

864
00:57:18,023 --> 00:57:21,324
<i>playing all these funny games
Crusoe came up with.</i>

865
00:57:21,402 --> 00:57:23,199
<i>He had all sorts of crazy ideas.</i>

866
00:57:23,278 --> 00:57:25,782
<i>Oh! Like hiding seeds in the ground.</i>

867
00:57:32,914 --> 00:57:35,541
<i>Crusoe had a funny way of eating.</i>

868
00:57:35,625 --> 00:57:36,967
<i>He peeled the fruit.</i>

869
00:57:37,043 --> 00:57:40,217
<i>And boy, did he eat slow.</i>

870
00:57:40,295 --> 00:57:41,342
Ah!

871
00:57:44,550 --> 00:57:46,177
<i>It took quite a while,</i>

872
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:50,106
<i>but despite his awkwardness
and all of his flaws,</i>

873
00:57:50,181 --> 00:57:53,230
<i>Crusoe surprised even
the most sceptical among us.</i>

874
00:57:53,309 --> 00:57:55,561
That's it, that's it. Watch your step.

875
00:57:55,644 --> 00:57:58,443
I just put the finishing touches
on our new home.

876
00:57:58,523 --> 00:58:00,617
New home.

877
00:58:00,692 --> 00:58:01,739
Hold it right there.

878
00:58:01,858 --> 00:58:04,077
First thing we must do
is christen the place.

879
00:58:04,152 --> 00:58:05,324
It's good luck, you know.

880
00:58:05,445 --> 00:58:08,119
I christen thee... Oh!

881
00:58:09,367 --> 00:58:12,246
Oh, never mind.

882
00:58:12,327 --> 00:58:14,329
Three cheers for us.

883
00:58:14,414 --> 00:58:16,461
Wow! Now, look at that.

884
00:58:16,541 --> 00:58:19,795
It's so beautiful!

885
00:58:20,335 --> 00:58:22,134
<i>Hip, hip, hooray!</i>

886
00:58:41,858 --> 00:58:44,702
What in the world is that noise
he's making?

887
00:58:44,818 --> 00:58:47,538
- Sounds like Scrubby when he needs food!
- Hmm!

888
00:58:47,612 --> 00:58:50,286
It's painful, mates.
Let's get outta here.

889
00:58:53,786 --> 00:58:54,833
Oh!

890
00:58:59,333 --> 00:59:03,088
Personally, I think it sounds beautiful.

891
00:59:07,507 --> 00:59:10,101
A party and we weren't invited.

892
00:59:10,177 --> 00:59:13,853
Mal! Quit your daydreaming.
I am starving here!

893
00:59:13,931 --> 00:59:15,148
Oh, coming.

894
00:59:20,188 --> 00:59:25,284
You know how difficult it is
in my condition to hunt right now.

895
00:59:25,358 --> 00:59:29,034
Have you tried to make it
to the other island lately?

896
00:59:29,112 --> 00:59:33,710
Oh, May. You know the last time I tried
I almost drowned.

897
00:59:34,744 --> 00:59:38,373
I'm afraid we're stuck
with just the bugs and spiders.

898
00:59:38,498 --> 00:59:40,920
They sound delicious.

899
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:43,594
Now, go and hunt some up for me.

900
00:59:43,668 --> 00:59:45,797
Right, darling.

901
00:59:45,922 --> 00:59:49,300
I'll wrap 'em in seaweed
just the way you like 'em.

902
00:59:54,514 --> 00:59:58,690
<i>With the nest completed,
Crusoe moved on to a new project.</i>

903
00:59:58,768 --> 01:00:02,237
<i>We didn't have to forage for food,
we had this great nest.</i>

904
01:00:02,313 --> 01:00:05,943
<i>And we even had indoor plumbing!</i>

905
01:00:06,025 --> 01:00:08,652
<i>Paradise just got better.</i>

906
01:00:23,626 --> 01:00:27,096
That human sure has made life
peachy for us.

907
01:00:27,213 --> 01:00:28,965
Rosie, he's bonzer to the max.

908
01:00:29,047 --> 01:00:30,264
I tell ya, old girl,

909
01:00:30,382 --> 01:00:33,226
if this new world Mak
talks about is this cushy,

910
01:00:33,302 --> 01:00:34,974
it may not be that bad after all.

911
01:00:36,264 --> 01:00:40,440
Getting a little plump, aren't we?
Sitting around all day.

912
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:43,905
Ain't nothing wrong with a few curves,
Kiki, honey.

913
01:00:45,438 --> 01:00:47,657
With Crusoe doing the fishing,

914
01:00:47,733 --> 01:00:51,362
we'll be putting some curves
on you too in no time, Kiki.

915
01:00:52,947 --> 01:00:55,496
Ooh, what do we have here?

916
01:00:55,574 --> 01:01:00,172
Hmm. Looks like Crusoe is going to
put your fishing skills to shame, Kiki.

917
01:01:05,626 --> 01:01:10,222
<i>As time passed, life became
more and more comfortable for us all.</i>

918
01:01:10,297 --> 01:01:13,141
<i>Yet Crusoe seemed very sad at times.</i>

919
01:01:13,217 --> 01:01:15,469
<i>He missed his old world.</i>

920
01:01:15,552 --> 01:01:19,056
<i>He built a strange tower
an the highest point of the island,</i>

921
01:01:19,139 --> 01:01:21,768
<i>with bright lights burning every night.</i>

922
01:01:23,603 --> 01:01:26,902
Another day, no ships in sight,
little fella.

923
01:01:27,023 --> 01:01:29,650
What I wouldn't give to see the sun
set over the Thames.

924
01:01:29,733 --> 01:01:31,360
Thames?

925
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:36,873
Come on, partner.

926
01:01:42,621 --> 01:01:44,420
I don't get it.

927
01:01:44,498 --> 01:01:46,876
Why does he light this every night?

928
01:01:46,958 --> 01:01:49,757
In the hope that some other humans
will pass by.

929
01:01:49,836 --> 01:01:52,510
If they see the signal,
they'll come and rescue him.

930
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:58,429
<i>I knew the chances
of leaving this island</i>

931
01:01:58,512 --> 01:02:01,766
<i>were becoming slimmer as time went by.</i>

932
01:02:01,891 --> 01:02:04,485
<i>I just didn't know how slim.</i>

933
01:02:04,559 --> 01:02:06,402
More humans on our island?

934
01:02:06,561 --> 01:02:08,313
That's not going to happen.

935
01:02:17,989 --> 01:02:20,742
And now, my friends,
like all good Englishmen,

936
01:02:20,826 --> 01:02:25,956
a moment of silence to give thanks
for this bountiful harvest.

937
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:33,137
Psst! Mind your manners.

938
01:02:33,213 --> 01:02:37,184
- Our host is...
- Taking a snooze, it appears.

939
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:38,974
Or worse.

940
01:02:42,974 --> 01:02:45,648
Psst! Hey, stop fooling around.

941
01:02:50,856 --> 01:02:52,858
At least we're not out in that weather.

942
01:02:52,942 --> 01:02:55,945
Oh, it's miserable out there.

943
01:02:56,027 --> 01:02:57,746
Listen to you guys!

944
01:02:57,822 --> 01:02:59,324
We're meant to live in the weather.

945
01:02:59,447 --> 01:03:01,371
Have you all gone soft?

946
01:03:01,449 --> 01:03:03,952
Whoa, whoa, Kiki.

947
01:03:04,036 --> 01:03:05,583
Why get so worked up?

948
01:03:05,663 --> 01:03:07,630
Oh, you haven't seen worked up.

949
01:03:07,706 --> 01:03:09,128
Answer me this.

950
01:03:09,291 --> 01:03:11,840
What happens to us
when Crusoe leaves this island?

951
01:03:11,918 --> 01:03:13,670
I mean, have you thought of that?

952
01:03:13,753 --> 01:03:15,802
Kiki, now... Now, listen.

953
01:03:15,922 --> 01:03:20,224
Oh, I'm listening.
I'm listening loud and clear, Mak!

954
01:03:23,054 --> 01:03:24,476
Shall we eat'?

955
01:03:31,731 --> 01:03:36,657
If I could just find
one little morsel.

956
01:03:36,735 --> 01:03:39,409
One measly little morsel.

957
01:03:40,447 --> 01:03:42,701
It's mine! It's all mine!

958
01:03:42,782 --> 01:03:44,751
Mine, mine, mine, mine!

959
01:03:49,914 --> 01:03:52,134
- What's yours?
- Nothing.

960
01:03:52,251 --> 01:03:57,427
You wouldn't be depriving your family,
now, would you, sweetheart?

961
01:03:57,547 --> 01:04:00,391
Yes. I mean no.

962
01:04:03,846 --> 01:04:04,938
Oh!

963
01:04:10,143 --> 01:04:11,771
Oh, May, that hurts.

964
01:04:11,853 --> 01:04:13,856
Shame on you! I should...

965
01:04:15,231 --> 01:04:17,576
Look, the ship's falling apart.

966
01:04:18,902 --> 01:04:20,280
Our luck is turning.

967
01:04:20,445 --> 01:04:24,451
Maybe we'll be able to make it back
to the main island after all.

968
01:04:29,914 --> 01:04:33,963
Hey, what do you say we go outside
and have some fun on the waterslide?

969
01:04:34,043 --> 01:04:37,797
Great idea!
I love all the smells after a good rain.

970
01:04:37,880 --> 01:04:39,382
I'll catch up with you guys later.

971
01:04:39,507 --> 01:04:42,806
I'd better find Kiki first,
make sure she's all right.

972
01:04:57,983 --> 01:05:00,452
Why didn't that ship just vanish
into the sea?

973
01:05:00,527 --> 01:05:03,327
Our lives are never
going to be the same again.

974
01:05:19,088 --> 01:05:23,092
Shall we have a little snack before
we move on to the main island?

975
01:05:23,217 --> 01:05:24,264
Oh!

976
01:05:29,181 --> 01:05:31,353
Help!

977
01:05:31,474 --> 01:05:34,023
Scream all you want, little bird.

978
01:05:34,144 --> 01:05:36,273
No one's going to save you now.

979
01:05:36,355 --> 01:05:38,483
I'll be the son of a sea cook!

980
01:05:38,565 --> 01:05:40,614
Watch out, children, it's the human!

981
01:05:40,693 --> 01:05:43,161
Get your filthy paws off my bird!

982
01:05:43,278 --> 01:05:44,905
Epi, Pango, to the left.

983
01:05:44,989 --> 01:05:46,661
We'd better get out of here, quick!

984
01:05:48,576 --> 01:05:50,373
Come on, everyone,
we've got them surrounded!

985
01:05:50,452 --> 01:05:53,126
Attack! Ka-boom!

986
01:05:53,204 --> 01:05:55,298
<i>Oh, he got me.</i>

987
01:06:00,378 --> 01:06:03,929
If this is heaven, why are you here?

988
01:06:06,552 --> 01:06:08,679
They're heading for the big island!

989
01:06:12,766 --> 01:06:15,565
They're everywhere! It's all my fault!

990
01:06:15,643 --> 01:06:17,021
We have to warn the others!

991
01:06:18,938 --> 01:06:21,407
Get to the nest! Now, hurry!

992
01:06:23,902 --> 01:06:25,996
- Predators!
- What?

993
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:27,822
Did he say predators?

994
01:06:29,157 --> 01:06:31,706
Oh, no! Hang on, everyone,
I'll get my musket.

995
01:06:41,628 --> 01:06:42,675
Oh!

996
01:06:44,507 --> 01:06:46,349
Batten down the hatches!

997
01:06:46,425 --> 01:06:48,018
Batten down the hatches!

998
01:06:48,135 --> 01:06:51,355
I just need a little powder
and then some shot.

999
01:06:51,429 --> 01:06:53,932
That's it, Tuesday, close everything up.

1000
01:06:55,809 --> 01:06:56,856
Ow!

1001
01:06:57,853 --> 01:06:59,900
Ah! They're everywhere!

1002
01:06:59,980 --> 01:07:02,199
Get off of me!

1003
01:07:02,315 --> 01:07:03,407
Ah!

1004
01:07:04,902 --> 01:07:05,994
Ah!

1005
01:07:10,657 --> 01:07:13,036
Stay away, you bloody ratters!

1006
01:07:31,302 --> 01:07:32,599
Tuesday, ah!

1007
01:07:33,347 --> 01:07:35,440
Help!

1008
01:07:35,516 --> 01:07:37,688
Get me down from here!

1009
01:07:37,768 --> 01:07:40,942
I may not know human
but that's "help" in any language.

1010
01:07:41,063 --> 01:07:43,815
Carmello! Crusoe needs our help.

1011
01:07:43,898 --> 01:07:45,150
Oh!

1012
01:07:45,233 --> 01:07:46,280
Ah!

1013
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:47,532
Uh-oh!

1014
01:07:51,657 --> 01:07:52,704
Oh, duck!

1015
01:07:53,742 --> 01:07:54,833
Ooh!

1016
01:08:05,420 --> 01:08:06,672
Hurry, Epi!

1017
01:08:12,969 --> 01:08:15,768
Whoa!

1018
01:08:18,516 --> 01:08:19,689
Whoa!

1019
01:08:20,728 --> 01:08:22,024
Oh!

1020
01:08:22,104 --> 01:08:23,605
Yee-haa!

1021
01:08:23,730 --> 01:08:24,778
Uh-oh.

1022
01:08:29,694 --> 01:08:33,289
Pango! Over here! Jump!

1023
01:08:33,364 --> 01:08:37,119
- Stand back, Epi!
- Ooh! Hurry! He's right behind you!

1024
01:08:39,121 --> 01:08:40,622
Yee-haa!

1025
01:08:42,291 --> 01:08:43,587
Go. go!

1026
01:08:46,295 --> 01:08:47,671
I need my musket.

1027
01:08:51,591 --> 01:08:54,720
Now look what you've done!
You guys stay put!

1028
01:08:57,890 --> 01:09:00,984
Oh, not again!
Stay away, you mangy cat!

1029
01:09:01,518 --> 01:09:03,020
Hang on, Crusoe!

1030
01:09:09,984 --> 01:09:11,328
Good job, buddy.

1031
01:09:25,708 --> 01:09:26,756
Huh?

1032
01:09:28,212 --> 01:09:30,805
That wasn't so bad.

1033
01:09:32,298 --> 01:09:35,802
Keep pushing.
I'll take care of these blighters!

1034
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:41,688
Whoa!

1035
01:09:42,685 --> 01:09:43,777
Whoa!

1036
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:45,524
Pango!

1037
01:09:45,604 --> 01:09:47,731
Help!

1038
01:09:58,158 --> 01:10:01,037
Whoa! That's awful high.

1039
01:10:02,371 --> 01:10:04,590
Come on, you can make it. Jump!

1040
01:10:04,664 --> 01:10:07,417
Oh, my. Here goes.

1041
01:10:08,836 --> 01:10:09,927
Ooh!

1042
01:10:13,297 --> 01:10:15,015
- Oh, dear.
- Good work!

1043
01:10:15,091 --> 01:10:17,220
Now, let's get out of here.

1044
01:10:18,345 --> 01:10:19,436
OK.

1045
01:10:20,680 --> 01:10:22,307
So long, furball!

1046
01:10:32,317 --> 01:10:34,536
Hungry, are we? Well, then, take that!

1047
01:10:35,654 --> 01:10:38,157
And how about a banana?

1048
01:10:40,951 --> 01:10:42,328
Whoo-hoo-hoo!

1049
01:10:42,411 --> 01:10:44,788
So long, Knucklehead!

1050
01:10:53,713 --> 01:10:55,636
Scrubby, the door!

1051
01:11:01,596 --> 01:11:02,939
Come on!

1052
01:11:08,228 --> 01:11:09,774
My turn!

1053
01:11:15,944 --> 01:11:17,320
Hello there.

1054
01:11:34,003 --> 01:11:35,801
Many thanks, Scrubs.

1055
01:11:40,469 --> 01:11:42,470
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1056
01:11:52,146 --> 01:11:54,945
Over here, Epi, girl! Get in the bucket!

1057
01:11:55,984 --> 01:11:58,407
Going up!

1058
01:11:58,487 --> 01:12:00,488
Pango, get him off!

1059
01:12:05,284 --> 01:12:07,037
Get off, you mangy cat!

1060
01:12:10,748 --> 01:12:13,547
Good work, Epi!

1061
01:12:13,627 --> 01:12:16,756
They'll never get me.

1062
01:12:16,838 --> 01:12:19,934
We got rid of 'em, didn't we?

1063
01:12:20,007 --> 01:12:21,975
Epi!

1064
01:12:22,051 --> 01:12:23,645
Pango!

1065
01:12:23,720 --> 01:12:25,563
Huh?

1066
01:12:31,979 --> 01:12:34,448
Whoa! Help me.

1067
01:12:34,564 --> 01:12:36,112
Look out behind you, Epi!

1068
01:12:45,868 --> 01:12:47,289
Whoa!

1069
01:12:48,161 --> 01:12:49,787
Whoa!

1070
01:12:51,038 --> 01:12:53,041
- Help!
- No! Epi!

1071
01:12:53,125 --> 01:12:55,422
Hang on, I'm coming!

1072
01:12:56,086 --> 01:12:58,259
Whoa!

1073
01:13:00,716 --> 01:13:02,434
Let go of me!

1074
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:25,119
The cats are trying to get in
through the hatch!

1075
01:13:25,198 --> 01:13:28,167
No! Rosie, no, that was Crusoe.

1076
01:13:28,243 --> 01:13:30,792
- Oops!
- Help me get this open.

1077
01:13:30,871 --> 01:13:33,168
Oh, I hope you didn't hurt him.

1078
01:13:33,247 --> 01:13:34,921
Oh! Everybody OK?

1079
01:13:35,000 --> 01:13:37,469
Everybody except Crusoe.

1080
01:13:37,543 --> 01:13:40,592
Come on guys, all together.
It's heavy.

1081
01:13:40,671 --> 01:13:43,766
Spread out, Rosie.
We need all the muscle we can muster!

1082
01:13:43,884 --> 01:13:45,261
Really? OK, OK.

1083
01:13:45,344 --> 01:13:48,268
One, two, three!

1084
01:13:48,346 --> 01:13:50,145
Well, that's a bit of a bummer, mates.

1085
01:13:50,222 --> 01:13:52,395
We need Crusoe! How's he doing, Kiki?

1086
01:13:52,475 --> 01:13:55,274
He's alive
but he won't be of any use to us.

1087
01:13:55,354 --> 01:13:58,858
We're going to need a miracle
to hold all these cats back.

1088
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:01,569
I got it. The musket!

1089
01:14:01,652 --> 01:14:03,494
Watch out, guys, it's going to be noisy!

1090
01:14:04,570 --> 01:14:06,368
Are you sure that's a good idea?

1091
01:14:06,448 --> 01:14:09,247
It's worth a try. What else can we do?

1092
01:14:14,038 --> 01:14:18,215
Uh-huh. This could be a bit more
complicated than I thought.

1093
01:14:22,922 --> 01:14:24,890
Hmm, the human's out.

1094
01:14:25,007 --> 01:14:26,385
Time to make our move.

1095
01:14:26,467 --> 01:14:28,970
Hurry!
We can't hold them off much longer.

1096
01:14:29,054 --> 01:14:31,648
He always pulls that
thingamajig back first!

1097
01:14:31,722 --> 01:14:33,690
OK, get ready.

1098
01:14:33,766 --> 01:14:36,940
Huh? That's weird. Hmm.

1099
01:14:37,020 --> 01:14:38,488
What's happening in there?

1100
01:14:44,403 --> 01:14:48,373
Hey, Tuesday, maybe this thingy
has something to do with it.

1101
01:14:48,489 --> 01:14:49,867
What thingy?

1102
01:14:55,997 --> 01:14:57,841
Ah!

1103
01:15:23,399 --> 01:15:26,404
Now what?
You know they're going to come back!

1104
01:15:26,528 --> 01:15:29,497
Maybe Crusoe will come to and save us.

1105
01:15:29,573 --> 01:15:32,667
I hate to break it to you guys.
We're on our own.

1106
01:15:32,743 --> 01:15:35,496
We have to get out of here,
hide someplace.

1107
01:15:35,578 --> 01:15:37,001
What about Crusoe?

1108
01:15:37,079 --> 01:15:40,425
Pango's right! We can't leave him here.

1109
01:15:40,500 --> 01:15:43,925
Guys, guys, it may not be perfect,

1110
01:15:44,046 --> 01:15:45,639
but I think I've got a plan.

1111
01:15:45,713 --> 01:15:49,139
Well, you'd better lay it out,
cos we're out of time.

1112
01:15:54,180 --> 01:15:57,980
All right, children, calm down.
They just got lucky this time.

1113
01:15:58,060 --> 01:16:02,314
We're going to sneak up on them
and make them pay.

1114
01:16:02,396 --> 01:16:05,149
Now let's show them what we're made of!

1115
01:16:06,859 --> 01:16:09,203
Oh. yeah!

1116
01:16:15,409 --> 01:16:18,253
Aw, you've got a broken wing, have you?

1117
01:16:18,371 --> 01:16:22,626
Don't worry.
We'll put you out of my misery.

1118
01:16:22,708 --> 01:16:24,756
Stay back or I'll shoot!

1119
01:16:25,962 --> 01:16:28,260
Not so brave now, are you?

1120
01:16:28,340 --> 01:16:29,682
Uh-oh!

1121
01:16:31,176 --> 01:16:33,975
Appears your luck has just run out.

1122
01:16:37,099 --> 01:16:38,190
Oh!

1123
01:16:46,315 --> 01:16:47,363
Whoa!

1124
01:16:49,569 --> 01:16:52,448
You'll have to be quicker
than that, ratter!

1125
01:16:53,823 --> 01:16:56,167
Get him! He can't fly!

1126
01:17:12,050 --> 01:17:15,520
That should take care of you
quite nicely.

1127
01:17:15,595 --> 01:17:18,939
Sweet dreams
from your favourite ratter.

1128
01:17:22,018 --> 01:17:24,237
Get ready!

1129
01:17:34,655 --> 01:17:37,659
- We got him cornered, May.
- Then, let's finish him off

1130
01:17:37,742 --> 01:17:40,586
once and for all.

1131
01:17:49,503 --> 01:17:51,346
Catch me if you can, ratter!

1132
01:18:03,143 --> 01:18:05,362
Whoa! Hold on!

1133
01:18:05,436 --> 01:18:07,985
Rosie, stop!
We have to wait for the signal.

1134
01:18:12,735 --> 01:18:15,284
This is it, give it all you have, Rosie!

1135
01:18:22,162 --> 01:18:24,789
- Huh? What's going on?
- They tricked us.

1136
01:18:24,914 --> 01:18:27,838
Hold on to that tail,
I'll take care of him.

1137
01:18:32,130 --> 01:18:34,757
We're not <i>so</i> cocky any more, are we?

1138
01:18:43,934 --> 01:18:47,279
Tuesday's in trouble!

1139
01:18:52,943 --> 01:18:54,034
Ah!

1140
01:19:09,000 --> 01:19:12,345
Oh, ho! That was a bonzer plan
you had there, mate.

1141
01:19:12,462 --> 01:19:14,635
Couldn't have done it without you guys.

1142
01:19:14,713 --> 01:19:17,637
Huh? The fire! Crusoe!

1143
01:19:23,931 --> 01:19:25,229
Crusoe!

1144
01:19:27,476 --> 01:19:29,069
Over here.

1145
01:19:49,707 --> 01:19:52,336
Ouch, that must have really hurt!

1146
01:19:52,418 --> 01:19:56,673
We pulled Crusoe out to safety,
unconscious but alive.

1147
01:19:56,756 --> 01:20:01,261
And then, out of the blue,
we get cannon-blasted from your ship.

1148
01:20:01,344 --> 01:20:04,597
Aye. The Captain can be one tough bloke.

1149
01:20:04,680 --> 01:20:07,935
What do you expect?
They're pirates, after all.

1150
01:20:08,018 --> 01:20:09,439
Pirates?

1151
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:13,110
You know,
like them nasty ratters,

1152
01:20:13,189 --> 01:20:14,940
only worse.

1153
01:20:15,024 --> 01:20:17,868
I had a pack of crazed cats on my right.

1154
01:20:17,944 --> 01:20:19,820
I was sure I was a goner!

1155
01:20:19,904 --> 01:20:23,328
I took my musket in one hand,
my sword in the other

1156
01:20:23,408 --> 01:20:25,831
and carved a swath to the savage hordes.

1157
01:20:25,909 --> 01:20:27,832
Whoa!

1158
01:20:27,953 --> 01:20:29,921
It was horrible, Captain!

1159
01:20:30,039 --> 01:20:34,636
That is the most fantastical yarn
I've heard in all me life!

1160
01:20:34,711 --> 01:20:36,429
'Tis no yarn, Captain.

1161
01:20:36,503 --> 01:20:38,426
Mmm. So you say.

1162
01:20:38,547 --> 01:20:40,720
Well, then, 'tis time to set sail.

1163
01:20:40,800 --> 01:20:42,927
You and your bird can take a bunk below.

1164
01:20:43,052 --> 01:20:47,432
Oh, Captain. I cannot tell you
how I long to see England again.

1165
01:20:47,515 --> 01:20:50,234
England?

1166
01:20:52,979 --> 01:20:56,483
We'll not be sailing for them ports.

1167
01:20:56,565 --> 01:20:59,159
Lest we want to be hanging
from the gallows.

1168
01:20:59,319 --> 01:21:02,413
Right, me mates?

1169
01:21:02,529 --> 01:21:05,203
But you see... We... I must...

1170
01:21:06,408 --> 01:21:08,377
Can you at least drop me off
a bit closer to home?

1171
01:21:08,494 --> 01:21:10,417
You're with us now.

1172
01:21:10,497 --> 01:21:14,127
Once a pirate, always a pirate.

1173
01:21:14,208 --> 01:21:16,506
Have you got a problem with that?

1174
01:21:16,586 --> 01:21:19,213
- But Captain, if I might...
- Enough talk!

1175
01:21:19,381 --> 01:21:23,636
Off with ya! And I'll be expectin' ya
to carry your weight, lad.

1176
01:21:23,717 --> 01:21:27,188
Or you'll be walkin' the plank, ye will,

1177
01:21:27,262 --> 01:21:29,265
OI' worse.

1178
01:21:34,686 --> 01:21:37,940
Look! ls it a mirage, May?

1179
01:21:38,065 --> 01:21:40,488
It's not a mirage, you idiot!

1180
01:21:40,568 --> 01:21:44,538
It's a ship! Children, start paddling!

Oh, you want some rum, do ya?
How's me fists instead?

1186
01:22:12,641 --> 01:22:14,439
These are some nasty pirates.

1187
01:22:14,519 --> 01:22:17,271
It won't end well, I'm afraid,
if we stay another moment.

1188
01:22:21,192 --> 01:22:24,195
Hey! What you be fixin' to do there?

1189
01:22:24,279 --> 01:22:27,498
Oh, nothing. Nothing at all.

1191
01:22:28,740 --> 01:22:31,585
That ingrate we done rescued
from the island

1192
01:22:31,661 --> 01:22:33,833
is trying to steal one of our rowboats!

1193
01:22:33,912 --> 01:22:37,007
If anybody gonna be stealing anything,
it be us!

1194
01:22:37,082 --> 01:22:38,426
No, I was just...

1195
01:22:42,505 --> 01:22:45,224
Hey! What's going on out here?

1196
01:22:45,341 --> 01:22:47,560
Bosun, he's trying to jump ship.

1197
01:22:47,635 --> 01:22:49,854
Get him and throw him in the brig.

1198
01:22:52,181 --> 01:22:55,481
Right! Let's teach him a lesson.
Take that!

1199
01:23:01,690 --> 01:23:03,068
Go get him!

1200
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:05,279
Hey, he's gettin' away! Grab him!

1201
01:23:05,403 --> 01:23:08,030
Ha, give me a piece of him!

1202
01:23:16,122 --> 01:23:18,841
There's no way off this ship, you fool!

1203
01:23:19,667 --> 01:23:20,713
Ah!

1204
01:23:20,918 --> 01:23:22,841

1206
01:23:25,131 --> 01:23:26,929
- Get him!
- Tuesday!

1207
01:23:27,884 --> 01:23:30,103
- He's mine!
- I'll grab him.

1208
01:23:30,177 --> 01:23:31,225
Whoa!

1209
01:23:33,055 --> 01:23:34,478

01:23:46,027 --> 01:23:48,529
You fools couldn't hit

1211
01:23:48,613 --> 01:23:50,990
Come on, lads, show me
what ye be made of.

1212
01:23:51,073 --> 01:23:52,826
Bosun!

1213
01:23:52,908 --> 01:23:57,539
Get your scurvy excuse for a pirate
down to my cabin! Now!

1214
01:23:57,663 --> 01:23:59,757
Aye, aye, Cap'n. Right away!

1215
01:24:01,876 --> 01:24:04,048
And the rest of you fools,

1216
01:24:04,127 --> 01:24:09,055
back to work before I give you each
ten lashes of me whip!

1217
01:24:09,175 --> 01:24:12,304
Blasted bird.

1218
01:24:13,555 --> 01:24:15,101
Cap'n, he's getting away!

1219
01:24:18,268 --> 01:24:22,398
- Shall we send some men after him?
- Nay. Let him go.

1220
01:24:22,479 --> 01:24:25,654
Oh, Captain!
Can't we fire a cannon shot,

1221
01:24:25,733 --> 01:24:27,780
blow him to smithereens'?

1222
01:24:27,859 --> 01:24:30,488
Why waste a good cannonball?

1223
01:24:30,613 --> 01:24:34,708
Let him spend the rest of his life
on that long-forgotten island.

1224
01:24:34,783 --> 01:24:39,130
That is, if the wild beasts
don't devour him first.

1225
01:24:41,373 --> 01:24:43,251
Aye, aye, Captain!

1226
01:24:49,881 --> 01:24:53,011
It's been nice knowing ya, Ruf.

1227
01:24:53,094 --> 01:24:56,268
We did have ourselves
a good run there, didn't we, Cec?

1228
01:24:59,684 --> 01:25:00,855
Jump!

1229
01:25:02,395 --> 01:25:05,023
I wasn't going to
let those ratters get you.

1230
01:25:05,105 --> 01:25:06,904
We friends gotta stick together.

1231
01:25:07,024 --> 01:25:10,324
Nice of you to think so.
Where we be headed off to, then?

1232
01:25:10,403 --> 01:25:12,497
