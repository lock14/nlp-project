1
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:45,827
Man, you know,
who says you need to buy a guitar?

2
00:02:39,659 --> 00:02:43,659
It's like a piece of sculpture.
Wonderful span of wood varnish.

3
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:48,284
The whole aroma of it.
Like a woman, you know?

4
00:02:49,419 --> 00:02:51,679
You can caress it like a woman.

5
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:56,767
Every element, the wood, the finish,

6
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,550
and all the different aspects
are there in the sound.

7
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:06,701
Electric conveys, like, amplification, energy.

8
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,734
It's all part and parcel of who I am,

9
00:03:13,735 --> 00:03:17,355
is playing the electric guitar
and bonding with it.

10
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,043
It's gonna be very interesting.

11
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:32,544
It's gonna be very interesting

12
00:03:32,545 --> 00:03:36,545
because both are really, really strong
character guitarists.

13
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,336
Both White Stripes and Zeppelin

14
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,223
were able to do something
that was their own, was unique,

15
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,434
and had never been done before.

16
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,811
When the three of us get together,
what's gonna happen?

17
00:03:49,812 --> 00:03:51,272
Probably a fistfight.

18
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:19,466
There's a lot of soul in this guitar.

19
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:22,197
When Jack plays it, it just goes wild.

20
00:04:24,931 --> 00:04:28,931
This is Edge's main... His main enchilada.
This is the brain of the system.

21
00:04:30,478 --> 00:04:34,478
It's going to be interesting to see him
layering his effects.

22
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:37,987
He's known to be a sort of sonic architect.

23
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:44,866
I plan to trick both of these guys.
That's basically what I'm gonna do.

24
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:48,017
Trick them into teaching me all their tricks.

25
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,549
We're going there to have a chat.

26
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:03,176
But it just so happens that the instruments

27
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:06,077
are sort of there as well, so who knows?

28
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:33,829
- What's this, Edge?
- It's a little... It's a form of yoga.

29
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,206
It actually was devised in Wales.

30
00:05:38,921 --> 00:05:40,311
It's called Daboke.

31
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:45,719
Are you...
What's the BlackBerry to do with it?

32
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,560
It's just a little adaptation I've made

33
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:51,543
just to make better use of time.

34
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,576
Does Sting do this?

35
00:05:55,521 --> 00:05:59,471
He doesn't do Daboke,
he does some other kind of yoga.

36
00:06:09,118 --> 00:06:12,198
I'm very interested in what hardware can do

37
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,769
to an electric guitar sound.

38
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,135
I love effects units.

39
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,138
They've always pushed music forward.

40
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,756
When he pushes a button...

41
00:06:22,757 --> 00:06:26,487
Let's say that button addresses that unit,
you know?

42
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,356
This button addresses that unit.

43
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,806
And it's very rarely

44
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,807
that he will use the same sound
ever again in 20, 23 songs.

45
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:56,777
The guitars are set per song

46
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,710
with their output levels.

47
00:07:01,337 --> 00:07:05,337
They're dedicated for that song
and that guitar level is...

48
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:10,843
He sets his effects to receive
that guitar level in a particular way.

49
00:07:21,774 --> 00:07:23,358
I drive everyone crazy.

50
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:27,028
I drive myself totally crazy,
trying to get the sound

51
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:31,029
that I can hear in my head
to come out of the speakers.

52
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:35,617
It's my voice, that is my voice,
what's coming out of the speaker.

53
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,815
That'd be wicked.

54
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:52,222
Take out the TC.

55
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:28,332
Technology is a big destroyer
of emotion and truth.

56
00:08:31,677 --> 00:08:34,095
Opportunity doesn't do
anything for creativity.

57
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:36,932
Yeah, it makes it easier,
and you can get home sooner,

58
00:08:36,933 --> 00:08:40,363
but it doesn't make you
a more creative person.

59
00:08:48,569 --> 00:08:52,197
That's the disease you have to fight
in any creative field.

60
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:53,118
Ease of use.

61
00:09:13,135 --> 00:09:14,525
All right, sing it.

62
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,018
Yeah, that's it.

63
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,478
By the time I'm getting into teenage years,
like, late '80s and things like that,

64
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,647
I don't remember that many
rock 'n' roll bands

65
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:28,158
being around that were that popular.

66
00:09:28,609 --> 00:09:30,151
Things were changing so much in music.

67
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,892
The technology was taking over so much.

68
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,573
Technology was
heavily distracting everybody.

69
00:09:34,574 --> 00:09:37,993
I mean, people started spending weeks
trying to get the perfect snare drum

70
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:39,624
and gated reverb sound.

71
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,303
That's right. That's right.

72
00:09:46,836 --> 00:09:49,976
So processed, it wasn't real at all anymore.

73
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:55,285
Just go up top.

74
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:10,066
If you really want to get girls to pay attention

75
00:10:10,067 --> 00:10:11,987
kick that chair out like...

76
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:50,896
Because of the amplification
and the tactile quality of it,

77
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:54,900
you can hear the very, sort of,
characteristics of each player.

78
00:10:56,947 --> 00:11:00,947
People have just tried to stretch the limits,
come up with new techniques.

79
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:05,622
There's always something new
that other people are bringing to the table

80
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:08,653
that is to be reckoned with very seriously.

81
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:33,909
Dynamics,

82
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:38,064
light and shade,

83
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:42,246
whisper to the thunder,

84
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,170
sort of invite you in, sort of intoxicating.

85
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:27,787
Well, the thing that fascinates me about it,

86
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:31,458
and always has about the six strings,
no one has ever approached...

87
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:35,459
They all play in a different way and,
you know, their personality comes through.

88
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:39,674
During my time
as a songwriter and performer,

89
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:43,967
I've kind of watched and felt
that I was seeing the end of the guitar

90
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:47,517
as a kind of focus for popular music.

91
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,312
And yet every time I think
it's kind of counted out,

92
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:54,293
it flares up somewhere else.

93
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:58,398
I keep guitars that are, you know...
The neck's a little bit bent,

94
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:01,821
and it's a little bit out of tune,
and I want to work and battle it

95
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:05,822
and conquer it and make it express
whatever attitude I have at that moment.

96
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,597
I want it to be a struggle.

97
00:13:09,747 --> 00:13:12,417
I have no idea what these are, but...

98
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:42,567
My early demos were real sketches.
They weren't fully fleshed out.

99
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:52,255
That's interesting. That ended up...

100
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:59,417
It's the music that tells us
the direction the song should go.

101
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:03,588
As writers, we start with the feeling
and everything follows from that.

102
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:11,263
These guitar parts ended up
in the final version,

103
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,340
so this could be discovering, you know,

104
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:18,937
those particular voicings
of the chords and what have you.

105
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,618
Four, five, six.

106
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,705
Bono's actually calling out the timing.

107
00:14:46,218 --> 00:14:47,198
That's funny.

108
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,172
Four, five, six.

109
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,144
'Cause the first section's
in a different time signature,

110
00:14:56,145 --> 00:15:00,145
so it was a little bit of a head trip
to go between the two.

111
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:04,277
One, two, three, four, five, six. One...

112
00:15:04,278 --> 00:15:07,068
But you can count it in different ways.

113
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:10,850
...six. One, two, three, four, five, six.

114
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:13,782
One, two, three, four, five, six.

115
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:21,711
Or you can go, one, two, three,
one, two, three.

116
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,442
It's like a waltz beat.

117
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:28,340
One, two, three, one, two, three,
one, two, three, one, two, three.

118
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:24,729
When you start to treat the sound,
you start to invoke locations.

119
00:16:25,734 --> 00:16:29,734
As I'm working, I'm often thinking about,
"Where is this?"

120
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,536
Where is this location?

121
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:40,453
Wow, there was a whole science block
there when I was living here.

122
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,476
That's amazing.

123
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:47,811
We played on a kind of
flat area over there with,

124
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:51,883
I wouldn't say a paying audience...

125
00:16:56,765 --> 00:16:58,205
We all got up here.

126
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,016
Larry was back here obviously

127
00:17:02,563 --> 00:17:04,873
and I think I was on this side.

128
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:08,839
- You were there?
- Yeah, I was this side, yeah.

129
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:11,561
Actually, and have been ever since.

130
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,121
This was where we used to rehearse.

131
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,626
Now, this is really the very,
very beginning for us, you know.

132
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:29,627
So, this was Mr. McKenzie's room,
and he was very nice to us.

133
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:36,134
So, rehearsal was 10 minutes of clearing
away desks and chairs,

134
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:39,538
and then an hour of

135
00:17:41,518 --> 00:17:43,644
seeing if we could get anything together.

136
00:17:43,645 --> 00:17:46,785
None of us could play at this point, really.

137
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:50,485
For a while, we would come
and we would try and go through songs,

138
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:53,866
and it was really bad. Like, really, really bad.

139
00:18:12,382 --> 00:18:16,382
The thrill was just being able to do it
even if you did it badly.

140
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:29,532
Hello.

141
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:35,822
We're always worried about being satisfied.

142
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:39,823
When you become satisfied,
it's sort of like you just die.

143
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,585
My name is Jack White, and this is my big
sister, Meg White, on the drums.

144
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:53,586
Thank you for letting us into your home.
We really appreciate it.

145
00:19:07,729 --> 00:19:11,729
What can I do with three strings
on a guitar instead of six?

146
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:16,904
It takes me three steps to get over

147
00:19:16,905 --> 00:19:20,408
to play the organ in the middle of this song.
Put it four steps away,

148
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:24,409
then I'll have to run faster
and I'll push myself harder to get to it.

149
00:19:39,261 --> 00:19:41,304
Meg and I don't even talk about
what the first song's gonna be.

150
00:19:41,305 --> 00:19:42,555
We just go out and play.

151
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,765
Think of something fast,
hurry up and think of something,

152
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:46,976
because these guys want a show.

153
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,645
People know when something's fake

154
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:53,274
and they know when something's rehashed
and rehearsed.

155
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,443
They know when you're telling
the same joke between songs

156
00:19:55,444 --> 00:19:58,304
that you told in Poughkeepsie last night.

157
00:19:58,447 --> 00:19:59,777
They can smell it.

158
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:16,400
I play really old guitars, plastic guitars.

159
00:20:20,761 --> 00:20:22,678
If you want it easy
you buy a brand-new Les Paul

160
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,659
or a brand-new Stratocaster.

161
00:20:33,315 --> 00:20:36,565
And this is my main guitar that I played live

162
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:39,989
for my 10 years in the White Stripes.

163
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,457
It's a hollow piece of plastic.

164
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:45,660
And you got this
at Montgomery Ward's department store.

165
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:49,591
Sears sold Silvertones
and Montgomery Ward sold Airlines.

166
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:53,665
I want to show you, Jack, what the...
If you just take this and...

167
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:14,021
Yeah, that's it. Pick a fight with it.

168
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:16,899
That's what you gotta do.
Pick a fight with it and win the fight.

169
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,940
He's learning.

170
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:22,881
I'd like to introduce Led Zeppelin to you.

171
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:32,704
On bass guitar, John Paul Jones.
This is John Paul Jones.

172
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:38,323
On drums, John Bonham.

173
00:21:43,927 --> 00:21:45,617
Lead guitar, Jimmy Page.

174
00:21:51,601 --> 00:21:53,351
And myself, Robert Plant.

175
00:21:54,730 --> 00:21:57,273
We were so comfortable playing
with each other

176
00:21:57,274 --> 00:22:00,064
that we could take it in any direction.

177
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:08,239
The four members of the band
had taken on this sort of fifth element.

178
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,293
Passion, honesty and competence.

179
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:20,227
Absolute musical heaven.

180
00:23:01,463 --> 00:23:02,263
Wow.

181
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:08,302
Boy, oh, boy,
this brings back some memories.

182
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:15,014
Yeah, this is... Well, come straight
into the entrance hall

183
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:19,105
and this is the hall
where the drums were set up

184
00:23:19,106 --> 00:23:21,616
and where Levee Breaks was recorded.

185
00:23:29,699 --> 00:23:32,326
We had been recording in this room here.

186
00:23:32,327 --> 00:23:34,662
Bonzo had ordered a new drum kit.

187
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:38,457
His tech, you know, his road manager,
had set it up in the hall.

188
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:42,458
And when Bonzo came out,
he started playing it in this thing,

189
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,094
and it was this huge expanse.

190
00:23:46,842 --> 00:23:49,718
You're getting the drums
reflecting off of the walls,

191
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:53,049
you know,
this wonderful ambience to the drums.

192
00:23:55,475 --> 00:23:58,455
Yeah, you can hear the reflective surfaces.

193
00:23:58,728 --> 00:24:01,518
You know, it's really live and ambient.

194
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,860
We had a recording truck
parked on the outside here.

195
00:24:05,861 --> 00:24:09,196
And you'd be running the wires
from their cables

196
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:11,907
with the mic leads, running them
into the house.

197
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:15,518
The mics were put up here
over the banisters here.

198
00:24:18,248 --> 00:24:21,500
In those days,
the drummer would be in a little booth

199
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:25,061
so the drums were just totally,
you know, crushed.

200
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,757
This was quite radical.

201
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:32,258
After this you heard of other,
you know, drummers

202
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:36,721
and bands looking for lift shafts
and things to record in,

203
00:24:36,725 --> 00:24:38,695
to get the height, you see.

204
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:53,446
We'd done three albums
that were recorded in the studio.

205
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:55,842
And this was another approach.

206
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:30,058
As a kid, what was going on in the music

207
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:34,111
was as important to me as what was
going on vocally and lyrically,

208
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:35,946
and it always was.

209
00:25:45,669 --> 00:25:48,059
Just word of mouth and grapevines.

210
00:25:50,465 --> 00:25:51,265
Isolation.

211
00:25:54,135 --> 00:25:57,925
We moved house and the guitar was there,
left behind.

212
00:25:58,139 --> 00:25:59,306
It was one of these, sort of,

213
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:02,817
weird interventions of the guitar
into our family.

214
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:07,603
It was just like a sort of ornament
left behind at the house.

215
00:26:23,498 --> 00:26:27,498
For anyone who could play guitars,
they all played skiffle.

216
00:26:28,128 --> 00:26:31,798
That was the sort of
community project at the time.

217
00:26:34,301 --> 00:26:37,111
Played on massive guitars and washboards.

218
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:40,671
Local cuisine.

219
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,597
Very, very English. Pre-rock this is.

220
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,514
We all weaned on that music.

221
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:57,823
It was like a sort of rock 'n' roll
breastfeeding of it.

222
00:26:57,824 --> 00:27:01,374
I went to school one day
after hearing this stuff

223
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,704
and seeing Lonnie Donegan
on the television.

224
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:07,041
This guy actually had a guitar
and he was playing Rock Island Line.

225
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:08,432
It was like, "Wow."

226
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:10,210
And I said, "I've got one of those at home."

227
00:27:10,211 --> 00:27:12,713
And he said, "Bring it along
and I'll show you how to tune it."

228
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:15,591
Well, that was more accessible
to be able to start to play.

229
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:17,509
Right, you could put a band together
pretty easily.

230
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,012
I mean, you could get to know one chord
and just strum it all day

231
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:22,683
and be having a great time, you know.

232
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:42,201
We were a little local band
and we were playing around

233
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:45,122
school dances, and not even the slightest,

234
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:49,283
mildest consideration
that that would go into something.

235
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:52,252
There wasn't this driving thing,
that the minute you hit your teens,

236
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:53,703
you gotta be famous.

237
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:57,424
What are your two names? Yours is?

238
00:27:57,425 --> 00:27:59,218
- James Page and...
- David Houston.

239
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:00,636
And you're just learning to play the guitar?

240
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,721
- Yes, from a teacher.
- From a teacher.

241
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,264
Do you play anything except skiffle?

242
00:28:04,265 --> 00:28:05,724
Yes, Spanish and dance.

243
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,102
Do you? What are you
gonna do when you leave school?

244
00:28:08,103 --> 00:28:09,263
Take up skiffle?

245
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:12,360
No, I want to do, well, biological research.

246
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:27,243
Dublin in the mid-'70s was really
economically very challenged.

247
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:33,943
The economy was in the toilet.

248
00:28:38,633 --> 00:28:42,193
We just didn't believe
that anything could change.

249
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,857
There has to be more than this.

250
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:58,458
This is not the only thing
that is on offer here.

251
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:43,197
You want to figure out
how you want to play guitar,

252
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,938
what your niche will be.

253
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,133
You just start digging deeper.

254
00:29:48,369 --> 00:29:51,413
When you're digging deeper
into rock 'n' roll,

255
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:55,414
well, you're on a freight train
headed straight for the blues.

256
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:12,417
1930s, really scary version of the blues.

257
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:17,564
If you go back and listen
to some of these songs,

258
00:30:17,565 --> 00:30:21,565
I mean, you can't really believe
that they were even recorded to wax.

259
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:25,521
Robert Johnson. Dark Was the Night.

260
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,033
Blind Willie Johnson.

261
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,911
"I asked her for water,
she gave me gasoline."

262
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:33,252
Minor key, anti the establishment.

263
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:37,864
Questioning themselves.

264
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:39,970
Painful.

265
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:47,126
There's a tension in that music
that you can feel.

266
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,931
It just feels like there's this place where,
you know,

267
00:30:50,932 --> 00:30:54,372
my soul rests
and those guys were expressing it.

268
00:31:05,864 --> 00:31:08,424
In the Bible, God cursed the ground,

269
00:31:08,449 --> 00:31:12,449
so that the man will always be...
Will have to work hard.

270
00:31:13,454 --> 00:31:17,454
Whether you're a farmer, or a carpenter,
or a guitar player, or whatever it is,

271
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:21,156
you have to fight these man-made materials.

272
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,734
Fifteen-minute guitar solos,

273
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,990
15-minute organ solos or the drum solos.

274
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:39,127
There was a huge element
of self-indulgence.

275
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:43,147
Professional rock musicians
who looked down upon their fans.

276
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:49,160
Those old colors were dead,
and we wanted none of it.

277
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:58,683
Spinal Tap, that's a movie that I watched.

278
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:03,649
I didn't laugh, I wept.
It was so close to the truth.

279
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,261
Music really was searching at that moment.

280
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:19,913
I'd listen to anything with a guitar on it
when I was a kid, you know...

281
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:20,714
Yeah.

282
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:25,082
...that was being played, and all those
different approaches and the echoes,

283
00:33:25,253 --> 00:33:28,296
but the first time I heard the Rumble,
it was like...

284
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:31,133
That was something that had so much
profound attitude to it.

285
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:34,054
- Yeah, it really does.
- It really does.

286
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:40,514
Now he's starting to increase
a vibrato on his amplifier.

287
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,890
You hear... And it gets more intense.

288
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:15,172
Most of my day was spent
going through these records,

289
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:16,703
listening to sounds,

290
00:34:17,889 --> 00:34:20,279
or playing guitar with the sounds.

291
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:26,885
I was pulled in through those speakers.

292
00:34:28,191 --> 00:34:30,241
This wonderful guitar playing.

293
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:34,353
Got to get to grips with that.

294
00:34:34,989 --> 00:34:36,559
Just two people, bass.

295
00:34:38,993 --> 00:34:41,593
Go home and see if you can play it.

296
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,713
All these old friends
that I used to visit on a daily,

297
00:34:51,714 --> 00:34:54,574
almost hourly, almost a per-minute basis.

298
00:34:57,845 --> 00:35:00,285
Okay. Might get loud for a second.

299
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:18,278
As kids, we were so experimental
with whatever was around.

300
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,380
Taking stuff apart,

301
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:32,383
we were always tinkering,
always messing around.

302
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:37,735
We built a guitar
when my brother was 16. I was 14.

303
00:35:41,389 --> 00:35:45,129
Literally hand-wound the magnets
to make the pickups.

304
00:35:48,604 --> 00:35:50,184
Every little component.

305
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:58,950
Got wood from Barry O'Connell's
parents' place.

306
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:04,582
Hand-carved the neck,
hand-carved the body,

307
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,081
sawed the grooves, put the fret wire in,

308
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,472
every aspect, and put it together.

309
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:23,096
I mean, it wasn't the best guitar
that's ever been made,

310
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,377
but it functioned.

311
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,668
Never wanted to play guitar, ever.

312
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,801
Everyone plays guitar.

313
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:44,762
What's the point?

314
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:56,713
I'm the youngest of 10 kids,
and there was just stuff around.

315
00:36:56,714 --> 00:36:58,634
A microscope, a power tool.

316
00:37:04,347 --> 00:37:05,972
When you're in a family of 10 kids,

317
00:37:05,973 --> 00:37:09,017
I mean, it's just a given.
You're gonna be sharing all day long.

318
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,868
Hand-me-down clothes, hand-me-down toys.

319
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:15,190
Different interests,
and everyone's in and out all the time.

320
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:18,026
Some people are walking to work,
some people are taking the bus.

321
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:20,137
Competition, fighting for food.

322
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:24,488
You push each other over.
You muscle your way into situations.

323
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,060
My brothers,
a bunch of them were musicians,

324
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:31,607
bass, keyboards, played guitar.

325
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:43,340
I got really into drumming,
playing along with the records.

326
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:45,656
Those rhythms got into me early.

327
00:37:48,683 --> 00:37:51,543
100% only caring
about music and rhythm.

328
00:37:53,604 --> 00:37:57,604
I had a bedroom that was
about seven by seven feet, really small.

329
00:37:57,608 --> 00:38:00,398
There was so much junk I had collected.

330
00:38:01,904 --> 00:38:04,044
I had two drum sets in there,

331
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:08,535
a guitar amplifier
and a reel-to-reel and no bed.

332
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:09,976
I took the bed out.

333
00:38:11,038 --> 00:38:14,858
I slept on a piece of foam
on an angle by the door.

334
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:33,601
The thing that we started out with
is a clear idea

335
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:36,382
of what we did not want to sound like.

336
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:40,439
Time to bop with the best in rock and pop
on this week's Top of the Pops!

337
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:49,892
Top of the Pops was
this longstanding pop TV show.

338
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,670
Most of it was pretty anemic.

339
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:03,587
If one out of the 10 items on the show
was cool, you were lucky.

340
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:12,098
That was the only live music
that we could get to see.

341
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,434
Making their debut on this week's
Top of the Pops,

342
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:17,187
here's The Jam and an effervescent new 45.

343
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,758
One, two, three, four!

344
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:37,287
It was like somebodyjust lit
the touch paper on this bomb.

345
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:41,338
So unexpected.
I'd never seen anything like it.

346
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,807
And a hope for a new beginning.

347
00:39:52,556 --> 00:39:54,696
It was like a switch went on.

348
00:39:57,728 --> 00:40:00,808
If we believed fully in what we were about,

349
00:40:00,981 --> 00:40:04,981
that actually was far more important
than how well you could play.

350
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:14,491
Our limitations as musicians were
ultimately not gonna be a problem.

351
00:40:15,704 --> 00:40:17,784
I was like, "I can do that."

352
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:26,009
Total commitment,

353
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:30,924
getting across what you wanted to say
in as straightforward a way as possible.

354
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:34,264
I started inventing chords to get that sound,

355
00:40:34,265 --> 00:40:35,849
that kind of ringing sound.

356
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,940
Most people play E like this.

357
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:41,856
Full of a sort of rich, complex tone,

358
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,400
which is a combination
of all the major elements of the chord.

359
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:52,949
I always wanted to simplify it
and make it more pure,

360
00:40:52,950 --> 00:40:56,950
and so I found ways of playing those chords
where I'd eliminate certain notes.

361
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,491
So there's a more clear sound.

362
00:41:04,211 --> 00:41:07,421
You probably hear it more...
As opposed to...

363
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:17,925
Really paring it down
to the absolute bare minimum.

364
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:21,311
When it's so simple,
you can turn it up really loud

365
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,402
and it's got more aggression.

366
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,947
Is it right to the C?

367
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:51,090
- No, actually, what I meant is...
- It can't be.

368
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:51,891
Yeah.

369
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,230
And then up to the hook.

370
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,294
- Right.
- Are you sure about that C?

371
00:42:28,295 --> 00:42:29,963
- Okay.
- That sounds good, doesn't it?

372
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,839
Sounds great, guys. Roaring, yeah.

373
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:33,180
Punk-rock nihilism.

374
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:37,300
- There's a bit of the punk rock in this man.
- I think there's some punk left in there.

375
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:51,756
Distortion, anger,

376
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,338
the punk ideal.

377
00:42:56,824 --> 00:43:00,410
Guys or someone maybe who got picked on,
like a lot of us did, in high school.

378
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:04,131
This is our chance to, you know,
push you down now.

379
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:14,267
Southwest Detroit, a tough town.

380
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,791
It puts up with a lot and keeps going.

381
00:43:24,768 --> 00:43:28,438
There was very few white families
left in the '80s.

382
00:43:30,441 --> 00:43:31,858
My family had a stiff upper lip.

383
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:35,859
Well, we're not leaving.
We're not running away like everybody else.

384
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:43,033
I lived in an all-Mexican neighborhood.
Mexican Town, it's called.

385
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:45,127
It was uncool to play guitar.

386
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:46,748
To play an instrument was

387
00:43:46,749 --> 00:43:50,609
the most embarrassing thing
you could probably make up.

388
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:54,380
But hip hop and house music,
that's what everyone wanted to hear.

389
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:55,541
DJs and rappers.

390
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:02,279
It was very uncool to actually
play an instrument.

391
00:44:02,598 --> 00:44:05,568
There was no record store, no guitar shop.

392
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:11,532
Nobody liked rock 'n' roll or blues music.

393
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:35,251
By the time I'm 15, I'm playing more
and I'm pretty reasonably accomplished.

394
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:42,759
Pop music was rubbish,
so we weren't gonna be playing that.

395
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,909
Playing blues music,
music of the Chess catalog,

396
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:55,180
not going with the flow.

397
00:44:58,112 --> 00:45:02,112
Planning winter gigs, coming out hot,
getting in the back of the van.

398
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:04,929
There's not proper heating in the van.

399
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:08,385
I thought, "This is getting really tiresome."

400
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:12,375
Sleeping on the equipment
in the back of the van,

401
00:45:12,376 --> 00:45:14,116
driving to the next gig.

402
00:45:15,796 --> 00:45:18,426
Getting ill, heavy bouts of influenza.

403
00:45:21,969 --> 00:45:25,346
I just thought, it's like beating
your head against a wall here.

404
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:27,377
And I figured that it was...

405
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:31,228
Best thing to do at that point
was actually retire.

406
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,543
So I went to art college.

407
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:43,804
Just as much as I wanted to play guitar,

408
00:45:44,742 --> 00:45:46,942
I also wanted to be an artist.

409
00:45:49,413 --> 00:45:51,913
It had always been something in me.

410
00:45:53,834 --> 00:45:57,834
I wanted to know the techniques
of oil painting, life drawing,

411
00:45:58,672 --> 00:46:00,372
graphic design, sculpture

412
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:06,582
and the techniques used by the old masters.

413
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:23,026
You know, I apprenticed out
to a lot of people when I was younger.

414
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:28,198
I was an apprentice in an upholstery shop
when I was a teenager.

415
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:33,206
Brian Muldoon was the master
of the upholstery shop

416
00:46:33,207 --> 00:46:35,917
and he was the one teaching me,
and he played drums.

417
00:46:35,918 --> 00:46:38,528
Well, I guess I'll play guitar then.

418
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,546
So when we were done with our workday

419
00:46:40,547 --> 00:46:44,547
we'd move the couches over,
and set up and play in the shop.

420
00:46:48,806 --> 00:46:52,806
Surf and rockabilly, Dick Dale,
and trying to absorb everything.

421
00:46:54,895 --> 00:46:56,103
He'd pick me up from school.

422
00:46:56,104 --> 00:46:57,897
I'd start tearing down the furniture,

423
00:46:57,898 --> 00:47:00,942
ripping off fabric
and cotton off of old chairs,

424
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,623
gluing fabric to foam on weird curves,

425
00:47:04,738 --> 00:47:06,781
tearing off all of the old fabric.

426
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:09,283
You can imagine all the stuff
that's inside of a couch.

427
00:47:09,284 --> 00:47:11,604
M&M'S, cereal, and babies' toys.

428
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:19,085
Here's how you sew a welt cord,

429
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:22,588
or here's how you sew a fly strip
on the back of a decking.

430
00:47:22,589 --> 00:47:24,619
He exposed me to punk music.

431
00:47:24,758 --> 00:47:27,158
The Velvet Underground, The Cramps.

432
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:31,261
Really took me under his wing to be
an employee and to play music together.

433
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:36,352
And then I started writing songs.
We kind of became a band.

434
00:47:36,353 --> 00:47:40,353
We got to put out a record
and we called it The Upholsterers.

435
00:47:41,275 --> 00:47:44,125
So, this song is Froggy Went a-Courting,

436
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:47,968
you know, the folk song,
Froggy Went a-Courting.

437
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:51,860
But I'd never heard it like this before though.

438
00:47:54,705 --> 00:47:57,905
I was really into the drummer first off, I...

439
00:47:58,959 --> 00:47:59,759
Oh, yeah.

440
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:07,401
And this right here, it blew my mind here.

441
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:24,831
The Flat Duo Jets,
two-piece band from North Carolina.

442
00:48:25,235 --> 00:48:28,615
Guitar, drums and vocals,
just like me and Meg.

443
00:48:33,368 --> 00:48:36,728
I went and saw him play
and I was blown away.

444
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:40,791
There was nothing on stage.
There was nothing there.

445
00:48:40,792 --> 00:48:44,792
He was using a little 10-watt amp
and Silvertone guitar.

446
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:58,640
Headed in, what I would have thought
at the time, backwards direction.

447
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:08,426
I had to reassess what backwards
meant in my mind.

448
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:16,574
That opened up a whole new inspiration
for me about the guitar.

449
00:49:24,252 --> 00:49:27,682
I started to leave the drums alone a little bit.

450
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:37,891
The first guitar I ever bought.

451
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:40,685
This was, you know, brand-new
when I bought it.

452
00:49:40,686 --> 00:49:42,103
It's just been with me ever since.

453
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:46,104
And when we recorded our first album
with Steve Lillywhite,

454
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:49,276
we were in the studio in Dublin
and we did the backing tracks.

455
00:49:49,277 --> 00:49:53,277
And he said, "You know, let's do
some overdubs with a different guitar."

456
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,525
I said, "What do you mean?

457
00:49:55,867 --> 00:49:59,867
"We only have one guitar.
This is the only guitar we own in the band."

458
00:50:16,638 --> 00:50:19,358
I was 17, I think, the summer of '78.

459
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:26,662
And my family actually were in New York.

460
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:29,650
It was like walking into a movie for me.

461
00:50:29,651 --> 00:50:33,070
I mean, I remember, not only did they speak
like they did in the movies,

462
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:36,157
but the cars looked like they did
in the movies.

463
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:40,158
That's actually how people spoke.
That's actually what the place looked like.

464
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,588
It's a burden when you have a truck or a van,

465
00:50:50,589 --> 00:50:53,632
because everybody you know wants you
to move their stuff for them, you know.

466
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:55,384
So every time you get a phone call,

467
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:59,385
you're like, "Yeah, I'll come help you
move your stove or your safe."

468
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:08,404
I helped my brother move a refrigerator.

469
00:51:09,566 --> 00:51:13,566
Him and his wife started managing
a St. Vincent de Paul store.

470
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:18,852
It's like a Salvation Army
kind of store in Detroit.

471
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:22,713
So I helped him move a refrigerator there.

472
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:30,737
The sunburst. Tobacco sunburst.

473
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:35,031
My first electric. Just tremendous.

474
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,803
Just couldn't believe it
when I actually got it home,

475
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:41,004
and there it was in the house.

476
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:43,733
Fantastic.

477
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:52,310
This was the one.
This was the one that I was after.

478
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:56,737
I went around to the stores on the street

479
00:51:58,031 --> 00:52:00,021
and found Stuyvesant Guitars.

480
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:07,026
Guitars everywhere, people everywhere.

481
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:13,812
This instrument was just there,
calling out to me.

482
00:52:16,091 --> 00:52:17,081
This Explorer.

483
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:25,686
I was really starting to go on my way then.

484
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:30,101
My technique started to improve.
It became like a total addiction,

485
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:36,149
to the point where actually
I was now starting to take it to school.

486
00:52:36,278 --> 00:52:39,658
And I'd be practicing
during the recess breaks.

487
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:44,201
And then it got to the point
where the guitar was confiscated.

488
00:52:44,202 --> 00:52:48,202
They thought it was going to be
counterculture or something.

489
00:52:48,206 --> 00:52:50,816
It wasn't doing any harm to anybody.

490
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:53,710
Not then, it wasn't.

491
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:59,216
So, when I helped him move
the refrigerator, he said,

492
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,385
"Well, how about taking this guitar
for payment?

493
00:53:01,386 --> 00:53:03,554
"Thanks for helping us," you know.

494
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:06,855
And I loved it so much I couldn't believe it.

495
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:12,224
I was like, "Whoa, man, that was worth it."

496
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:29,413
I plugged it into an amp in the room
and just could tell.

497
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:32,082
This was the kind of guitar
that had possibilities.

498
00:53:32,083 --> 00:53:34,353
There were songs in this guitar.

499
00:53:35,962 --> 00:53:39,962
Twenty minutes in this store
just defined the sound of the band.

500
00:53:41,301 --> 00:53:42,811
This better work out.

501
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:35,226
I had ideas about modifying
or kind of designing my own guitar.

502
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,780
I liked the body shape of this one.

503
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:41,816
I was trying to customize one of these
Gretsch guitars for The Raconteurs.

504
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:51,245
When people take a guitar
that's known for a certain sound

505
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:54,336
and throw it into a whole different context,

506
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:57,583
something interesting happens.

507
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:26,923
Knowing that there was a threshold,
to volume,

508
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:30,278
I wanted to get more sustain out of things.

509
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:33,405
I bumped into this chap, Roger Mayer,

510
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:38,356
and all he told people
was he worked at the Admiralty.

511
00:55:39,127 --> 00:55:40,687
Did I have any ideas?

512
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:10,488
I had this record at home of a guitar
that had a lot of sustain on it.

513
00:56:11,076 --> 00:56:14,078
And I got him to come around
and have a listen to it.

514
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:16,049
I said, "Can you get that?"

515
00:56:16,456 --> 00:56:20,456
And he went away
and came back with this phenomenal thing.

516
00:56:23,421 --> 00:56:26,641
A distortion pedal
which overloads the signal,

517
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:34,238
overdrive the sound
and make it sound pretty rude.

518
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:08,320
This is what I'm actually playing.

519
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:19,056
That's it. The rest is the foot pedal,
the effects, the whole thing.

520
00:57:19,102 --> 00:57:20,644
You know, so if you're on an acoustic,
trying to say,

521
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:24,595
"Here's my new riff.
It's a really cool riff. Listen."

522
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,204
Oh, my Lord.

523
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:38,254
Wow.

524
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:42,101
That's impressive. That's great.

525
00:57:44,586 --> 00:57:48,586
It was a single cutaway,
and I had this brilliant luthier

526
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:50,400
in Seattle, Randy Parsons.

527
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:52,885
And he made it a double cutaway for me.

528
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:55,846
And then I said, "Well, listen, I have an idea.

529
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,639
"Can you just... Can you put a silver...

530
00:57:57,640 --> 00:58:00,790
"A Green Bullet harmonica mic
on the guitar,

531
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:04,102
"so I can just take it out, and right there?"

532
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:32,382
I got this echo unit
and I brought it back to rehearsal,

533
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:36,383
and just got totally into playing,
but listening to the return echo

534
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:44,141
filling in notes that I'm not playing,
like two guitar players rather than one.

535
00:58:50,860 --> 00:58:54,860
The exact same thing,
but it's just a little bit off to one side.

536
00:58:56,324 --> 00:59:00,154
I could see ways to use it
that had never been used.

537
00:59:00,495 --> 00:59:02,375
Suddenly everything changed.

538
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:11,827
So, Jimmy, what...

539
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:14,967
You know, those early songs
that you played on in the studio,

540
00:59:14,968 --> 00:59:16,593
- what did you actually play on?
- Yeah.

541
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:18,428
I mean, that I would have heard,

542
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:22,429
- like, there's all these legends about...
- Well, sometimes you could hear what I did,

543
00:59:22,475 --> 00:59:24,768
and other times,
you couldn't hear what I did.

544
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:26,979
But, I mean, I was on Goldfinger.

545
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:28,146
That was fantastic.

546
00:59:28,147 --> 00:59:31,817
Yeah. She did one take
and collapsed at the end of it.

547
00:59:31,818 --> 00:59:35,112
But, you know, it was huge, huge
big orchestra in the EMI number one,

548
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,947
which was a massive, great studio,
you know.

549
00:59:36,948 --> 00:59:39,157
They did a lot of film stuff in there.

550
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:42,411
- And, like, The Kinks stuff?
- I did some Kinks stuff.

551
00:59:42,412 --> 00:59:43,996
- Really?
- Yeah. I didn't...

552
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:46,582
I mean, you know, it all got out of hand,
you know, about what I had done

553
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:49,543
- and what I hadn't done.
- Really, it became, like, the stuff of legend.

554
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:53,544
You know, before you knew what it was,
you'd done everything.

555
01:00:01,222 --> 01:00:05,222
I was filling in, in an interval band
at a club called The Marquee Club,

556
01:00:07,812 --> 01:00:09,742
playing on Thursday evening.

557
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:18,694
And somebody asked me, said,
"Would you like to play on the record?"

558
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:30,414
The record just bubbled in
on the lower end of the Top 20.

559
01:00:32,211 --> 01:00:34,011
Then it moved so quickly.

560
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:39,632
The invitations to do more records
were so frequent after that.

561
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:48,181
An apprenticeship,
going into recording studios.

562
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,956
"Can you put a riff to this?"

563
01:00:56,235 --> 01:01:00,235
A song with all its parts, the verses,
the choruses, the middle eights.

564
01:01:00,990 --> 01:01:03,600
Feel free to add light detail on it.

565
01:01:05,036 --> 01:01:09,036
The musical notation,
you needed to be right on top of it.

566
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:17,631
I could put on all these different hats.

567
01:01:17,632 --> 01:01:21,632
Film music or a jingle.
"Well done, Jimmy, that's great."

568
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:05,634
By the time I was about 18,
somebody played me Son House.

569
01:02:07,306 --> 01:02:08,746
That was it for me.

570
01:02:14,772 --> 01:02:17,732
This spoke to me in 1,000 different ways.

571
01:02:18,317 --> 01:02:21,037
I didn't know that you could do that.

572
01:02:22,238 --> 01:02:24,048
Just singing and clapping.

573
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:26,825
And it meant everything.
It meant everything about rock 'n' roll,

574
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:30,346
everything about expression
and creativity and art.

575
01:02:31,164 --> 01:02:33,894
One man against the world in one song.

576
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:57,544
That's my favorite song. Still is.

577
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:02,691
It became my favorite song
the first time I heard it and it still is.

578
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,949
I heard everything disappearing.

579
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:10,327
It didn't matter that he was clapping off time.

580
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:14,328
It didn't matter
that there was no instruments being played.

581
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:18,838
All that mattered
was the attitude of the song.

582
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,720
Jumping off into the unknown.

583
01:03:36,229 --> 01:03:40,229
Hope and have faith that the next chord
or the next few notes will come to you.

584
01:03:44,737 --> 01:03:46,777
On occasions, you get nothing

585
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:50,242
and you come out
feeling like a complete idiot

586
01:03:50,243 --> 01:03:51,618
and that you don't know anything,

587
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:55,449
and you can't play guitar
and you can't write songs.

588
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:18,225
There's this little house on the coast
of an area outside Dublin, called Howth.

589
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:30,115
We decided that this is
where we would rehearse,

590
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:33,376
leading up to the recording
of the War album.

591
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:46,920
There have been bombs here before,
but nothing of the scale of yesterday's.

592
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:50,385
And as the full implications
of the number of dead and injured

593
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:53,221
and the destruction to property
became apparent,

594
01:04:53,222 --> 01:04:57,222
it's also clear that the South now
has a serious security problem of its own.

595
01:05:02,064 --> 01:05:04,504
Bombs going off on a weekly basis.

596
01:05:06,861 --> 01:05:08,551
So many lives destroyed.

597
01:05:09,989 --> 01:05:12,509
Perverted, distorted idea of freedom.

598
01:05:17,455 --> 01:05:18,845
No life was sacred.

599
01:05:33,512 --> 01:05:37,472
The crunch came.
This one day I went into this session.

600
01:05:37,558 --> 01:05:40,798
I saw this big ream of paper in front of me.

601
01:05:43,981 --> 01:05:46,491
I started to get very uncomfortable.

602
01:05:49,445 --> 01:05:53,445
There was no run-through.
They counted you in, and off you went.

603
01:05:57,703 --> 01:05:59,333
It literally was Muzak.

604
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,708
I'm not actually creating anything.

605
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:07,170
I'm interpreting
whatever it is that's written down now.

606
01:06:07,171 --> 01:06:09,611
And I'm even doing Muzak sessions.

607
01:06:14,136 --> 01:06:15,586
Tearing my hair out.

608
01:06:18,599 --> 01:06:20,899
And I've got to get out of it.

609
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:34,837
And I thought about it for a long time,
for days.

610
01:06:35,616 --> 01:06:37,867
There's this whole new world
that's just opened up in front of me

611
01:06:37,868 --> 01:06:41,288
and I have to figure out,
"How do I get there?

612
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:44,192
"Am I not allowed to get there?"

613
01:06:55,678 --> 01:06:59,678
Bono put it to me, he said,
"You know, Edge, I think maybe if you

614
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:02,402
"would do a bit of time on your own."

615
01:07:09,942 --> 01:07:12,682
I remember feeling, "Well, can I write?

616
01:07:15,614 --> 01:07:19,444
"You know, am I a writer,
or am I just a guitarist?"

617
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:27,083
This is it. This is the day of departure.

618
01:07:28,127 --> 01:07:32,127
I wanted to get out there,
and I had a lot that I really wanted to do.

619
01:07:48,689 --> 01:07:52,689
The minute that I was in The Yardbirds,
that bow was out immediately.

620
01:07:58,157 --> 01:08:01,951
I shed this coat off of me,
and then I wanted to try everything

621
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:04,412
that was breaking rules.
I wanted to do things that sped up.

622
01:08:04,413 --> 01:08:08,413
I wanted to do things that were
like playing a bow and hurting people's ears.

623
01:08:14,381 --> 01:08:17,741
I started to look for ways to get away with it

624
01:08:18,344 --> 01:08:21,654
and not be some sort
of white-boy blues band.

625
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:24,953
And we went and played open-mic night.

626
01:08:27,228 --> 01:08:30,128
We were kind of in our own little world.

627
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:33,894
Meg didn't really want to do it.

628
01:08:35,111 --> 01:08:36,441
I was pushing her.

629
01:08:36,737 --> 01:08:38,613
If I put her behind the drums,

630
01:08:38,614 --> 01:08:41,449
then, you know,
maybe something interesting will happen.

631
01:08:41,450 --> 01:08:45,450
She just played like a little caveman
and a little child.

632
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:49,524
We started to form everything around Meg.

633
01:08:50,251 --> 01:08:52,751
We saw a bag of peppermint candies.

634
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:54,963
I said, "Well, that should be
on your bass drum.

635
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:57,934
"We should paint that
on your bass drum."

636
01:08:58,467 --> 01:09:01,307
By this time, I had found a red guitar.

637
01:09:03,597 --> 01:09:07,597
This red guitar and the peppermint candy
dictated the aesthetic of the band.

638
01:09:14,358 --> 01:09:18,198
White Stripes became the big way
to get away with it.

639
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:22,654
By having a brother-and-sister band
that was, you know...

640
01:09:22,992 --> 01:09:25,368
Red, white and black
was the complete aesthetic.

641
01:09:25,369 --> 01:09:27,036
And it was childish,
and we're presenting ourselves

642
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:29,289
in a real childish manner,
almost like cartoon characters.

643
01:09:29,290 --> 01:09:31,374
And a lot of distractions
to keep people away

644
01:09:31,375 --> 01:09:33,168
from what was really going on,

645
01:09:33,169 --> 01:09:36,629
which was, we were just really trying
to play this, you know.

646
01:09:36,630 --> 01:09:38,490
You know, still are, so...

647
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:46,866
I would just go to D with it
sort of in a blues way,

648
01:10:46,867 --> 01:10:49,827
and I was just singing a Son House lyric.

649
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,080
And then we go to D, then...

650
01:11:09,431 --> 01:11:11,661
Floating around blues structures.

651
01:11:26,991 --> 01:11:29,242
Did the press understand
what you were doing?

652
01:11:29,243 --> 01:11:31,244
No, I don't think they did.

653
01:11:31,245 --> 01:11:33,913
I didn't think they had a clue
what we were doing,

654
01:11:33,914 --> 01:11:37,914
as each album
changed in its sort of concept and variety.

655
01:11:48,512 --> 01:11:50,322
The reviews were terrible.

656
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:53,818
They didn't understand what we were doing.

657
01:11:54,685 --> 01:11:58,245
They gave the fourth album
a one-paragraph review.

658
01:11:59,857 --> 01:12:02,317
Now, there's a lot of material on that.

659
01:12:02,318 --> 01:12:06,318
Black Dog, there's Levee Breaks,
there's Stairway to Heaven.

660
01:12:07,197 --> 01:12:08,187
One paragraph.

661
01:12:28,218 --> 01:12:31,288
They didn't have a clue what was going on.

662
01:12:32,222 --> 01:12:36,222
I just didn't even bother
to read music papers after that.

663
01:12:41,190 --> 01:12:43,160
This car bomb has gone off.

664
01:12:44,443 --> 01:12:47,763
This bar has been raked
with machine gun fire.

665
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:57,239
Total disregard for human life.

666
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:10,604
We're not buying into this.

667
01:13:16,767 --> 01:13:19,087
I just remember being in a rage.

668
01:13:28,112 --> 01:13:30,552
When you go past a managed forest,

669
01:13:34,118 --> 01:13:36,318
you see a mass of tree trunks.

670
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:48,962
Then, at a certain point, you look again,
and you realize they're all in perfect rows.

671
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:53,895
Clarity.

672
01:13:58,350 --> 01:13:59,630
Clarity of vision.

673
01:14:03,355 --> 01:14:07,355
What you've been looking at
from the wrong angle and not seeing at all.

674
01:14:10,487 --> 01:14:11,287
You labor.

675
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:13,866
You sweat to see

676
01:14:16,076 --> 01:14:20,046
what you couldn't have seen
from that other perspective.

677
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:26,252
I just remember
just scrambling to try and put it down

678
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:28,763
before that moment passes and fades.

679
01:14:39,433 --> 01:14:43,433
And picking up the guitar
and that's what I came out with.

680
01:16:33,130 --> 01:16:37,130
You know, I come in here
and sometimes it's just not a great day,

681
01:16:37,968 --> 01:16:41,968
but there's always gonna be something
if you just keep going.

682
01:16:47,561 --> 01:16:51,230
If you don't have a struggle already
inside of you or around you,

683
01:16:51,231 --> 01:16:53,021
you have to make one up.

684
01:16:54,276 --> 01:16:56,726
These little things during the day.

685
01:16:58,238 --> 01:16:59,408
Extreme feelings.

686
01:17:00,157 --> 01:17:02,074
Something that made you angry
or something that made you

687
01:17:02,075 --> 01:17:03,185
upset orjealous.

688
01:17:54,586 --> 01:17:57,797
You wrote the essence
ofStairway to Heaven before you got here.

689
01:17:57,798 --> 01:17:59,799
- Yes, I had...
- What is your process

690
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:01,420
when you write a song?

691
01:18:04,054 --> 01:18:06,347
I can't tell you what the process is.

692
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:10,348
It changes from one thing to another,
but it usually comes just from...

693
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:14,397
For anybody who's writing or,

694
01:18:14,398 --> 01:18:17,900
you know, whether they're writing
written word or music or whatever,

695
01:18:17,901 --> 01:18:21,111
it just comes from the creative spark, really.

696
01:18:21,655 --> 01:18:22,905
It's all very spontaneous,

697
01:18:22,906 --> 01:18:26,906
but, you see, the whole reason
for being here was for that.

698
01:18:40,632 --> 01:18:43,892
The double neck came as a result
of Stairway.

699
01:18:44,845 --> 01:18:46,887
Stairwaywas done on the acoustic,

700
01:18:46,888 --> 01:18:50,888
with all these electric guitar string parts
on it that build it up.

701
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:53,644
I thought to myself,
"How am I going to do this on stage?"

702
01:18:53,645 --> 01:18:57,645
So, it became a necessity
relative to the song, if you like.

703
01:18:59,025 --> 01:19:02,225
'Cause then you could do the six-string part,

704
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:05,448
the acoustic part, electric, of course,
but the solo on this,

705
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:09,049
- and do the rest of it on the 12.
- Right. Yeah.

706
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:25,023
Being a studio musician,
you certainly don't speed up.

707
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:29,761
One of the things that I really wanted to do
straightaway was crescendo and speed.

708
01:19:47,324 --> 01:19:49,474
I liked this idea of movement.

709
01:19:59,878 --> 01:20:00,748
Pulse, push.

710
01:20:02,547 --> 01:20:05,747
Rise and fall in its intensity, in its power.

711
01:20:07,803 --> 01:20:08,963
Light and shade.

712
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:12,600
Wouldn't I want to be employing that?

713
01:20:31,576 --> 01:20:34,245
That was something
that was gonna keep increasing,

714
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:38,246
building, accelerating,
from the beginning to the very end,

715
01:20:38,708 --> 01:20:39,808
like an orgasm.

716
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:48,116
Every night that we went on stage,
it was living.

717
01:21:49,613 --> 01:21:51,713
Totally living at every point.

718
01:21:54,826 --> 01:21:58,826
The spark had become the flame
and the flame was burning really bright.

719
01:23:18,743 --> 01:23:19,543
That's it.

720
01:23:46,229 --> 01:23:50,229
There's a total concentration
on music and creativity and writing.

721
01:23:58,158 --> 01:23:59,738
Pushing the boundaries.

722
01:24:01,786 --> 01:24:03,536
Looking over the horizon.

723
01:24:05,957 --> 01:24:09,637
Musicians that were absolutely
on top of their game.

724
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:09,523
Great!

725
01:27:10,516 --> 01:27:11,316
Nice.

726
01:27:16,022 --> 01:27:17,232
Nice. That's it.

727
01:27:29,869 --> 01:27:32,369
You're supposed to join the family.

728
01:27:33,915 --> 01:27:36,585
You're supposed to become part of it.

729
01:27:36,668 --> 01:27:38,598
That family of storytellers.

730
01:27:52,183 --> 01:27:56,183
When it goes down into that break bit.
It's, yeah... It's G. Yeah.

731
01:27:57,438 --> 01:27:59,468
- D, C, C, G.
- Okay. Yeah.

732
01:28:00,275 --> 01:28:01,135
G, B minor?

733
01:28:01,818 --> 01:28:04,111
- G, D, C, it's the...
- Right here. I see. Yeah, okay.

734
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:06,113
The biggest thrill is creating something

735
01:28:06,114 --> 01:28:09,614
that has the power
to really connect with people.

736
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:12,661
That's why I took up the guitar
in the first place.

737
01:28:12,662 --> 01:28:16,662
What's the note here for the vocal?
For me, if I do it lower.

738
01:28:19,085 --> 01:28:19,885
Oh, that.

739
01:28:21,713 --> 01:28:23,563
I can do the high, but...

740
01:28:25,466 --> 01:28:27,136
Afraid I can't hit it.

741
01:28:27,969 --> 01:28:31,054
- I can't sing. I'm hopeless. Yeah.
- Really high ones, isn't it?

742
01:28:31,055 --> 01:28:35,045
Whether I took it on, or it took me on,
I don't know.

743
01:28:35,393 --> 01:28:37,123
The jury's out on that.

744
01:28:37,603 --> 01:28:38,923
But I don't care.

745
01:28:40,398 --> 01:28:43,538
I just really, really enjoyed it. That's it.

746
01:28:49,073 --> 01:28:53,073
I just noticed, I've been playing
the wrong second chord in the verse.

747
01:28:53,411 --> 01:28:57,411
- Have you?
- It's a B minor, actually, not an E minor.

748
01:28:58,416 --> 01:29:00,576
- Shit.
- Yeah, that's better.

749
01:29:00,918 --> 01:29:03,468
For me, it was a much bigger world.

750
01:29:03,629 --> 01:29:07,419
I had a voracious appetite for everything.
All of it.

751
01:29:22,523 --> 01:29:24,775
Music keeps progressing and moving on

752
01:29:24,776 --> 01:29:27,110
and people come up with new ideas
and new tricks

753
01:29:27,111 --> 01:29:31,111
and new ways to tell the same story
in a different way.

754
01:29:47,173 --> 01:29:49,433
We're all doing the same thing,

755
01:29:49,467 --> 01:29:53,277
attempting to share something
with another human being.

756
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:19,811
In essence, we are effectively the same band.

757
01:30:21,249 --> 01:30:23,569
We're a little bit more complex.

758
01:30:24,085 --> 01:30:28,085
But we're really still the band
that's crowded into the small little rooms,

759
01:30:30,883 --> 01:30:32,676
trying to play with each other

760
01:30:32,677 --> 01:30:36,346
and find those clues
that will take us somewhere new.

761
01:30:36,347 --> 01:30:39,683
Now, exactly where this note was
I have no memory.

762
01:30:39,684 --> 01:30:41,824
But this is where it was put.

763
01:30:47,567 --> 01:30:51,361
I loved this whole idea of, you know,
getting a band together.

764
01:30:51,362 --> 01:30:53,738
So I was definitely gonna do something.

765
01:30:53,739 --> 01:30:57,576
But if Larry had not put the message up,
I would have been in some other band.

766
01:30:57,577 --> 01:31:00,036
I don't know. It wouldn't have been U2.

767
01:31:00,037 --> 01:31:04,037
God knows who it would have been.
And if, you know, would I

768
01:31:05,126 --> 01:31:07,796
be doing what I am now? Probably not.

769
01:31:11,632 --> 01:31:14,072
I mean, I could be doing anything.

770
01:31:16,387 --> 01:31:20,387
I'd be, I don't know,
working in a bank somewhere or something.

771
01:31:38,784 --> 01:31:41,214
The day when you pick up a guitar

772
01:31:41,496 --> 01:31:44,456
and there's nothing
coming through whatsoever.

773
01:31:44,457 --> 01:31:47,067
There's no new pieces, no new ideas.

774
01:31:49,587 --> 01:31:53,587
And that's the sort of gift
that any creative person has.

775
01:31:53,674 --> 01:31:57,674
There's always that point that
that might happen to you.

776
01:31:58,596 --> 01:32:02,416
Or you're too old
to be able to pick the guitar up.

777
01:32:02,767 --> 01:32:06,767
And we're just trying to keep that day far,
far away and out of sight.

778
01:33:06,330 --> 01:33:10,330
This one's called Claudette.
After the actress Claudette Colbert.

779
01:33:10,376 --> 01:33:12,252
My tattoo artist did all this for me.

780
01:33:12,253 --> 01:33:16,253
He's really good at doing this on people,
so we figured he'd be doing it with...

781
01:33:16,507 --> 01:33:19,926
I bought him a wood burning tool,
so he could burn her face on the side of it.

782
01:33:19,927 --> 01:33:23,647
I made the pick guard,
so it looks like a brunette.

783
01:33:46,078 --> 01:33:48,371
And you come out
and bring your amp out here all the time?

784
01:33:48,372 --> 01:33:49,182
Yeah. Yeah.

785
01:33:50,458 --> 01:33:54,458
It's my thing. You know, I like to get out here
in the elements and rock out.

786
01:33:56,756 --> 01:33:58,386
Yeah, with the islands.

787
01:33:58,716 --> 01:34:02,716
The islands I always find very inspiring
for those long echo, delayed sounds.

788
01:34:18,110 --> 01:34:19,850
It's an actual theremin.

789
01:34:30,748 --> 01:34:34,388
It hasn't got six strings, but it's a lot of fun.

790
01:35:02,113 --> 01:35:04,489
I notice you have a picture of the Fab Four.

791
01:35:04,490 --> 01:35:08,220
It's actually not so much
reverence for The Beatles.

792
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:11,679
It's a kind of haircut reference for the crew.

793
01:35:28,973 --> 01:35:32,973
We almost had an accident
with a suit and a cell phone.

794
01:35:34,520 --> 01:35:38,520
He was probably right in the middle
of saying the words "totally organic."

795
01:35:53,581 --> 01:35:57,581
Look at that. Somebody's put the lyrics
to Glad to See You Go on their locker.

796
01:35:58,169 --> 01:35:59,919
What a coincidence. Okay.

797
01:36:00,671 --> 01:36:02,581
We used to play this song.
