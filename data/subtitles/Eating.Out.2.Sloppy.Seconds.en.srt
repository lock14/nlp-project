302
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,361
So, Troy, thethreeof us
arefalling behind

303
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:02,304
in art class
andwe were wondering...

304
00:14:04,143 --> 00:14:06,043
Do you havea preference?

305
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,450
See, itworks.

306
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,543
Nowtake off
your clothes, damn it!

307
00:14:16,789 --> 00:14:17,881
This is kindaweird.

308
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,083
No, we'rejust gonna draw.
Really.

309
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,360
So, didyou leave someone
special back home?

310
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:26,522
Nope.

311
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:27,690
That's probably good.

312
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:28,858
Yep.

313
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,299
I'vealways wondered
whatit would belike

314
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,029
to live on a farm.
I mean,

315
00:14:32,137 --> 00:14:33,900
what didyou do for fun?

316
00:14:34,006 --> 00:14:36,600
Mostlywe'd drive
aroundthestrip on weekends,

317
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,576
or throwparties
in somefield.

318
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:42,647
I always likedtheidea ofbeing
out among allthenature.

319
00:14:42,748 --> 00:14:44,716
Gettingfucked in arainstorm,

320
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:46,409
or gettingfucked on atractor,

321
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:47,849
or getting...

322
00:14:47,953 --> 00:14:50,080
Well, I can't say
I did allthat.

323
00:14:50,189 --> 00:14:51,588
Well, where did
you getfucked?

324
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,658

325
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,693

326
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:57,091
In the ass?

327
00:14:57,196 --> 00:14:58,424
Excuseme?

328
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:01,431

No, it's okay, I guess.

331
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:11,768
Girls... mostly.

332
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,941

Doesthat freak you out?

333
00:15:15,047 --> 00:15:18,073

So, didyou ever

342
00:15:36,835 --> 00:15:37,733

00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:53,816
'cause theycan, it's just...
I dunno.

348
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,444
Being gay, it seems
likeso much work.

349
00:15:56,555 --> 00:15:57,988
Amen, sister.

350
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,318
I mean, firstyou have
to tell everyone.

351
00:15:59,425 --> 00:16:00,585
That's no fun.

352
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:02,092
- Andthen there's rejection.
- You'renever hot enough.

353
00:16:02,194 --> 00:16:04,162

556
00:24:54,125 --> 00:24:57,026
Ummm... my story...

557
00:24:57,128 --> 00:25:00,188
Just speakfromthe heart -
likeJesus would.

558
00:25:02,567 --> 00:25:06,697
Well... I was
prettymuch born gay.

559
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:08,204
Momsaid myfirst
sentencewas,

560
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:10,035
"Getthoseboobs
out ofmyface. "

561
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:14,601
So... anyway, I lived thegay
lifestylefor awhile.

562
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:18,080
And I dated a lot of guys...

563
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:22,449
Alot of guys.

564
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:24,818
Just... mens and mens
and mens.

565
00:25:24,923 --> 00:25:26,948
I mean, theywere

566
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:29,253
"Kyle, pleasehavesexwith me.

567
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,658
Iwas so popular...

568
00:25:30,762 --> 00:25:32,730
Butthen itbegan
to takeits toll.

569
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:35,925
See, you realized thegays,

575
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,242

576
00:25:50,348 --> 00:25:52,475
Wellthen what exactly

577
00:25:52,584 --> 00:25:55,485

581
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:10,028

flewinto mylife.

582
00:26:10,135 --> 00:26:15,402
Asexy, 52-24-48

00:26:15,507 --> 00:26:17,134
Is Tiffani arhinoceros?

584
00:26:17,242 --> 00:26:18,903
Size doesn'tmatter.
Whatmatters is that

585
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:21,501
Ifell in love
and I never looked back.

586
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:27,641
Butwhataboutthe sex?

587
00:26:27,752 --> 00:26:29,049
Pieceof cake.
Ijust say,

588
00:26:29,154 --> 00:26:31,645
"Kyle, takeeverything you love
about Reese Witherspoon

589
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:34,782
and projectit onto this girl
who wantsto bewith you. "

590
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:36,520
And nowthey can't get enough.

591
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:37,856

00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:39,453
Yeah, 'causeyou seem
really gay.

593
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:41,031
Not anymore.
I'm telling you,

594
00:26:41,132 --> 00:26:43,566
there's nothing like
the smooth, wetporcelain lips

595
00:26:43,668 --> 00:26:46,603
ofthe vagina spreading
and enveloping me,

596
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:50,607
squeezing againstthehead
of mydick ever so firmly.

597
00:26:50,709 --> 00:26:53,200
Andthat's nothing compared
to whatit feels like

598
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:58,476
to eather outand lap up
allthose fresh juices.

599
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:06,583

True enough.

Therewasthis one guy.

684
00:31:00,091 --> 00:31:03,060
This sounds stupid,
but when I methim,

685
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:05,891
I sort of sawsomething
in his soul -

686
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:08,227
likealight.
Physicallyhe was nothing

687
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,233
likeany ofthe guys
I'd dated before,

688
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:14,328
butwhen I sawthat light,
I realized...

689
00:31:14,439 --> 00:31:16,600
this is my type, too.

690
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,700
So I asked himout, eventually.

691
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:21,278
That's deep.

692
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:22,676
Fuck you.

693
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,509

So whatever happened

695
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:29,010
Doesn'tmatter.

696
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:34,057
Anyway, that's...
ancienthistory.

697
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:38,323
Hey, you need a
workout buddy?

698
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:39,760

699
00:31:40,865 --> 00:31:42,492
This feels horrible.

700
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:44,067

00:31:44,168 --> 00:31:45,567

something I didn't share

885
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:06,799
with the group yesterday.

886
00:39:06,911 --> 00:39:12,110
I didn't exactly go cold salami
when I decided to turn straight.

887
00:39:12,216 --> 00:39:14,013
Therewerea fewslip-ups.

888
00:39:14,118 --> 00:39:15,779
Whileyou were with Tiffani?

889
00:39:15,886 --> 00:39:19,652
Yeah, and she's great
becausesheunderstands

890
00:39:19,757 --> 00:39:23,158
howpent-up feelings
can just explode

891
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:25,228
ifyou don't do
anything about'em.

892
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:28,230
So, it's okayif one
of us makes a mistake

893
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:30,323
everyoncein awhile.

894
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:33,267
We'veeven talked
about thepossibly of...

895
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,465
playing... together.

896
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:37,973
What, likea three-way?

897
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:39,736
Yeah.

898
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:41,744
I had athree-wayonce.

899
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,177
What?

900
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,975
Yeah, with two girls.

901
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,572
Oh, I guess that counts.

902
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,379
Barely.

903
00:39:48,486 --> 00:39:51,717
We were in this empty
farmhouseoutsideoftown.

904
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:54,586
Itwas going great.
Theyhad me in the middle

905
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,421
andwe werekissing.
And then theypulled

906
00:39:56,527 --> 00:39:59,018
their panties down
and pushed medowntown.

907
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:01,223
And that's when things
started to fall apart.

908
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:02,890
So, you didn'tlikeit?

909
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,026
Well, itwasn't doing
thatmuch for me.

910
00:40:06,137 --> 00:40:08,037
Doesthatmakeme gay?

911
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:10,198
Lots of straight guys
don'tlikeeating pussy.

912
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:12,400
They complain about
itallthetime.

913
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,909
Whathappened next?

914
00:40:14,011 --> 00:40:16,707
Well, thesituation
gotworse.

915
00:40:16,814 --> 00:40:22,548
I couldn't...
findtheir clits.

916
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:23,779
You couldn't?

917
00:40:23,888 --> 00:40:25,981
Or G-spots or whatever.

918
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:29,150
Iwas down thereforever.
It was embarrassing.

919
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:30,750
Theylaughed at me.

920
00:40:30,861 --> 00:40:32,453
Oneofthemeven

921
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,326
oftonguefucking -

922
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,730
seventeen attempts
and no clit.

923
00:40:36,834 --> 00:40:38,267
I knowwhereit's at.

924
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:39,461
You do?

925
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:40,730
Yeah.

927
00:40:42,206 --> 00:40:43,696
Showyou?

928
00:40:43,808 --> 00:40:45,207
Howdo you find it
on Tiffani?

929
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:46,833
Howam I supposed

930
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,809
I dunno.

931
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:53,477
How'boutl useyours?

932
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:55,745
You know, so you can
feel whatl'mdoing.

933
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:05,157

Nah, come on.

00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,398
I'll showyou

936
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:21,305
First, you gotta start
with just somelittleteases.

937
00:41:25,783 --> 00:41:27,478
Breatheon it.

938
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,581
Makeher squirm.

939
00:41:34,024 --> 00:41:36,686
Andthen you just...

940
00:41:38,362 --> 00:41:40,421
Which is usuallynot
thereaction thatl get.

941
00:41:40,531 --> 00:41:43,398
No, it's good.
It's good.

942
00:41:52,776 --> 00:41:56,337
In themiddleof all
of this, of course,

943
00:41:56,447 --> 00:41:58,574
isthelovebutton.

944
00:42:00,050 --> 00:42:05,613
Butmost girls go nuts
if you just... diveon in.

945
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:44,756
That's good.

946
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,420
That's really good.

947
00:42:48,933 --> 00:42:50,730
Sorryl missed

948
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:52,165

949
00:42:52,269 --> 00:42:54,237
Iwas just showing Troy

951
00:42:55,673 --> 00:42:56,765
Notthatl needthem.

952
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:58,364
Well, even Melissa Etheridge
could learn athing

953
00:42:58,475 --> 00:42:59,806
ortwo from Kyle.

954
00:42:59,910 --> 00:43:01,104
I gotta get going.

955
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:02,644
Stay.
There's plentyto eat.

956
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:03,940
Yeah, you don'thaveto go.

957
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:05,538
I gotta call itanight.

958
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:08,812
Thanksfor the...
time, Kyle.

959
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:14,783
Did you seethat?

960
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:16,689
One more session like that
and he's gonna explode.

961
00:43:16,794 --> 00:43:18,489
As long as hedoesn't
explodewith Marc first.

962
00:43:21,398 --> 00:43:23,127
Iwin!

963
00:43:24,101 --> 00:43:25,500
Whoa!

964
00:43:27,004 --> 00:43:28,437
What?

965
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:33,371
So when didyou firstknow
for sureyouweregay?

966
00:43:33,477 --> 00:43:35,069
Justnow.

967
00:43:36,447 --> 00:43:37,880
No.
I had mysuspicions

968
00:43:37,982 --> 00:43:41,042
when I was, like, 12 or 13,
butl didn'tknowfor sure

969
00:43:41,151 --> 00:43:42,641
until a couple years later-

970
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:45,187
when Iwent down
on myfirst guy.

971
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,689
And it'sthebest thing
that's ever happenedto me.

972
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,190
What?
Being gay?

973
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,557
Yeah.
Imaginethatyou think

974
00:43:51,662 --> 00:43:53,357
you'regonnalive
your lifeoneway-

975
00:43:53,464 --> 00:43:57,093
geta job, getmarried,
geta 3-bedroomhouse.

976
00:43:57,201 --> 00:44:02,070
And then you discover
this... thing aboutyourself

977
00:44:02,172 --> 00:44:05,039
that opens up amillion
new options asto howyou

978
00:44:05,142 --> 00:44:07,406
can liveyour life.
Suddenly you don'thave

979
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:09,638
those milestones that straight
peoplehaveto compare

980
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:11,339
each other against.

981
00:44:11,448 --> 00:44:14,645
You can choose
your own adventure.

982
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:17,414
I loved those books.

983
00:44:17,521 --> 00:44:19,284
Me, too.

984
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,017
Butaren't youworried
you'll end up all alone

985
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:23,059
and nothave any
of those things?

986
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,993
Doesn't everyone?
Gayor straight?

987
00:44:28,232 --> 00:44:29,597
Sprintyou home!

988
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:40,533
And just so you know,
Kyle's mom's reaction

989
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:42,669
to himbeing straight
wasn'tawesome.

990
00:44:42,780 --> 00:44:43,974
Huh?

991
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:46,208
Well, you said itlike
you were happyforthem,

992
00:44:46,316 --> 00:44:48,580
like that'stheway
it should be.

993
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,813
Myparents aretotallycool
with mebeing gay.

994
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:53,219
Yeah, butareyour parents
reallyokaywith it?

995
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:55,382
I'll bet Kyle's momgrew
to beokaywith it,

996
00:44:55,492 --> 00:44:58,052
butyou sawhow
happyshe was.

997
00:44:58,162 --> 00:45:00,494
That's whatparents
reallywantfortheir kids.

998
00:45:00,597 --> 00:45:03,361
Ifyou ask, mostparents
will saytheyjust want

999
00:45:03,467 --> 00:45:05,594
their kidsto behappy.

1000
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,694
Maybemymom would
behappier ifl putmydick

1001
00:45:07,805 --> 00:45:11,707
somewhere else, butyou've
seen thoseex-gays.

1002
00:45:11,809 --> 00:45:13,572
Isthathappy?

1003
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:16,908
Ifyour parents loveyou
and theythinkyou're happy,

1004
00:45:17,014 --> 00:45:19,312
they'll adjust.

1005
00:45:19,416 --> 00:45:22,943
I don'tthink myparents
would adjust to me being gay.

1006
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,544
They shouldn't have
anythingto do with it.

1007
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:26,987
You haveto be who you are.

1008
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:29,286
It'stheonlywayyou can
livewith yourself.

1009
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:33,996
And It'stheonlyway
I can liveatall.

1010
00:45:35,165 --> 00:45:37,292
Didyouwannatakea shower?

1011
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:40,131
Talk about getting my
creative juices flowing.

1012
00:45:40,237 --> 00:45:41,568
I didn'tknowyou were here.

1013
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:43,537
Wait.
Keep 'emdown.

1014
00:45:43,640 --> 00:45:45,301
Would you boys
letme drawyou?

1015
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:47,274
What? Together?

1016
00:45:47,377 --> 00:45:50,175
No, right where you are,
rightnow.

1017
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:53,579
I'll call it... "Proposition. "

1018
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:55,083
What do you think?

1019
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:56,618
I don't know...

1020
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,278
It's this or renting amovie.

1021
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:00,151
Choose your own adventure.

1022
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:06,321
When Iwalked in on thetwo
of you, Iwas like,

1023
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,557
"Fuckthis drawing one
person atatimeshit!

1024
00:46:08,665 --> 00:46:11,065
If I can capturethetension
between thesetwo...

1025
00:46:11,168 --> 00:46:12,465
Therewas tension?

1026
00:46:12,569 --> 00:46:15,732
Honey, itwas moretensethan
Star Jones in atraining bra.

1027
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,273
Nowmakethatlookyou had:

1028
00:46:18,375 --> 00:46:22,311

kinda scared.

1029
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:26,441
No... I dunno,

do to youwith that.

1031
00:46:28,685 --> 00:46:30,550
Trust me,
hecan do a lot.

1032
00:46:33,957 --> 00:46:35,515
Perfect.

1033
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:39,084
So... youtwo dated?

1034
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:40,788
Gwen was mylast girlfriend.

1035
00:46:40,898 --> 00:46:42,559
And Marc was myfirst.

1036
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:46,727
After him, all I ever
wantedto datewerefags.

1037
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:48,805
I'vegot an idea.

1038
00:46:48,906 --> 00:46:50,703
This couldtake forever,
and I see thepotential

1039
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:54,369
for something...
moreinteresting.

1040
00:46:54,478 --> 00:46:56,571
Could I do a series
with you guys?

1041
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,910
Almostlike a storythat
starts with this scene

1042
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:01,576
and goesfromthere?
What do you think?

1043
00:47:01,685 --> 00:47:02,913
I don't know...

1044
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:05,420
Ifl said posewith awoman,
you'd totally do it.

1045
00:47:05,522 --> 00:47:08,286
It's not likewe'd even have
timeto pose for a series...

1046
00:47:08,392 --> 00:47:11,452
I'lltakephotos

Butit's going
exactlyhowyouwanted.

1150
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:55,758
Ijust can't do it.

1151
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:58,459
If Kylewantsto pretend
to bestraightjustto have

1152
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:01,867
sexwith Troy,
that's his prerogative.

1153

Oh, great.

1156
00:54:32,402 --> 00:54:34,597
He's probablyfreaking out
about making itwith a guy.

1157
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:36,171
He's probablylooking
for someone who won't

1158
00:54:36,273 --> 00:54:37,797
cock-tease him.

1159
00:54:39,743 --> 00:54:41,870

I had sex with a guy.

1163
00:54:47,684 --> 00:54:49,515
Was it Marc?

1164
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:52,144
Oh, myGod,

00:54:52,255 --> 00:54:53,722

1169
00:55:00,530 --> 00:55:01,792

anything to do with us.

1235
00:59:11,915 --> 00:59:13,906
Thefucked up thing is,
even though you lied to me,

andto people you don't

Yeah, so c'mon.
You've sucked dick

1243
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:33,063
and eaten pussy.
Which is it?

1244
00:59:33,169 --> 00:59:35,603
That's what's been tripping
meup allthese years.

1245
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:37,969
I thoughtithad
to beoneortheother.

1246
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:41,566
Butafter sampling both,
I've come to a conclusion.

1247
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:44,738
I'm... bisexual.

1248
00:59:44,847 --> 00:59:46,508
There's no such thing!

1249
00:59:46,616 --> 00:59:47,708
Says who?

1250
00:59:47,817 --> 00:59:49,079
The laws ofnature!

1251
00:59:49,185 --> 00:59:50,880
It's likehorses
fucking gerbils!

1252
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:52,511
Well, then I'ma
freak of nature.

1253
00:59:52,622 --> 00:59:54,055
And I'mproud ofit.

1254
00:59:54,157 --> 00:59:57,183
Good!
Be proud, bi-boy!

1255
00:59:57,293 --> 00:59:59,261
Iwish you'd been proud
when wemet.

1256
00:59:59,362 --> 01:00:01,489
But I guessthat's hard
when peoplelikeyou

1257
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:04,863
andJacob Buchanan tell him
howbad itis to begay.

1258

Yeah.

1259
01:00:07,537 --> 01:00:09,562
I should've helped you instead
oftryingto takeadvantage

01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:12,300

knowing whatyouwere.

1261
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:16,003
So... what do we do now?

1262
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:18,444
We'regonna stop

1263
01:00:18,548 --> 01:00:20,482
No oneshouldtakeadvantage
of confused queer kids.

1264
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:22,744
Andthesooner we help them
seepastwhatthey don'tlike

1265
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:25,218
in themselves so they can
see thegreatthings
