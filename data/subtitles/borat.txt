I'm talking about humor.
- Oh, yes, you ask me about my mother-in-law.



Do you have a joke about your mother-in-low?
- No, why make a joke on a mother-in-law?



Do you ever laugh on people
with retardation?



Here in America, we try not to make fun of,
or be funny with things that people don't choose.



But perhaps you have seen not someone
with very funny retardation.



My brother, Bilok, have a verry
funny retardation.



Mental retardation, you know, causes a lot
of pain hardship for a lot of families.



Sometime, my sister, she show her vagin
to my brother and say



You will never get this!
You will never get this!



He, behind his cage, crazy -crazy,
everybody laughing. You never get this.



But, one time, he break the cage, and he get
this. And then we all laugh. High 5!



That would not be funny in America.



What is a NOT jokes?



A NOT joke is when we try to make
fun of something,



and what we do is we make a statement,



that we pretend it's true, but at
the end, we say NOT.



Which means it's not true.
- So teach me how to make one.

This CJ was like no
kazak woman I have ever seen.



She had golden hairs,
teeth as white as pearls.



And the ass hole of a 7 years old.



For the first time in my lifes,
I was in love.



In Kazakstan, it is illegal for more
than 5 woman to be in the same place.



Except for in brothel or in grave.



In US of A, many womans meet in a groups,
called a feminists.



I find them all.



So what does means this feminism?



It's the theory that women should be
equal to men in matters...



You are laughing. Well, that is
the problem.



Do you think a woman should be educate?
- Definitely.



But is it not a problem that a woman have
a smaller brain that a man?



That is wrong.



But a government scientist doctor
lama prove that it is size of squirrel.



Your government scientist?
He's wrong.



Give me a smile, baby.
Why angry face?



Well, what you say is very demeaning.
Do you know the world demeaning? -No.



I could not concentrate on what
this old men were saying.



All I could think about was this lovely
woman in her red water panties.



Who was this CJ?



Last night, I see, in my hotel room,



a woman called CJ on the television.
Do you know her? -No.



She from a town called the Baywatches.

- She lives in California.



O, you mean California.
- He's gonna look her up.



Ok, can we finish now?



Listen pussycat, try smile a bit.



We're finished, we have to leave.



Although I was obsessed by this CJ,
I could not pursue her.



or else my wife will snap off my cock.



Mister Sagdiyev?
- Yes.



I have a telegram for you.



You can read?
- Yes, I can.

and violated and break her.



She is now dead.



What you saying my wife is dead?



This it what it's...



Yes, sir. I'm sorry to inform you but that's
what the telegram says.



Hi 5!



Eventually, I persuaded Azamat that
we will travel to California



and make our reportings along
the way.



He insist we do not fly, in case the jews
repeated their attack of 9/11.



My name is Mike. I'm gonna be your

But then it look like I'm holding a gipsy
while I eat my hram.



I don't care what it looks like.
Use two hands when you drive, ok?



Watch the children.
- Ok, no problem.



Must not hit the children.



Look, there is a woman in a car.
Can we follow her?



And maybe make a sexy time with her.



Why not? - Because a woman has a right
to choose who she has sex with.



What!? They do?
- There must be consent.



How about that. That's good, ha?



It's not good for me.



You want have a drink? - You can't drink
when you drive. It's against the law.



Who is this car that follow us?



Maybe we lose them
- We better not lose them.



Hey, don't look at me. Eat my teets.



We'll make a right turn right here.



Don't look at me like that.
That will eat your shit.

- No, no there's no magnet.



He means the vehicle.
Women love the Hummers.

If I give you good price,
will you please put in pussy magnet?



There's no such thing in this country
as a... magnet.



If this car drive into a group a gipsy,
will there be any damage to the car?



It depends on how hard you hit them
and all that? - Hard!



If somebody rolls on the windshield,
it could crack your windshield.



How fast do I need to go to guarantee
I kill them?



With this vehicle right here, probably
doing 35-40 mph will do it.



When I buy my wife,



at the start, she was cook good,
her vagin work well,



and she strong on plow. But after
three years, when she was 15,



she become weak, her voice become a deep
Borat, Borat.



She receive a heir on chest.



And her vagin hang like
sleeve of wizard.



How do I know that this will not
happen with the car?

How much is it? - 52 thousand.



I am looking for something between
600- 650 dollars.

for 700 but with no warranty.
