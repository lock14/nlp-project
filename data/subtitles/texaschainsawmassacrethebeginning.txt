1
00:01:39,752 --> 00:01:43,131
Boss, I need a bathroom break!

2
00:01:43,131 --> 00:01:46,050
Please.

3
00:01:55,518 --> 00:01:57,604
Dear Lord, help me!

4
00:02:10,535 --> 00:02:11,911
Get the hell out of here.

5
00:02:16,290 --> 00:02:21,212
Well, that's what you get for
drinking on the job, Sloane.

6
00:02:21,254 --> 00:02:23,047
Hey, Sloane, take it easy!

7
00:02:24,882 --> 00:02:29,220
Sloane! Sloane! Damn it! Sloane!

8
00:02:30,179 --> 00:02:32,765
You can do it!

9
00:02:33,803 --> 00:02:37,599
Sloane. Sloane.

10
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:46,908
Uhh...

11
00:02:48,493 --> 00:02:51,580
Dear God help us.

12
00:03:46,968 --> 00:03:49,805
He's so beautiful.

13
00:03:51,515 --> 00:03:53,975
That's the ugliest thing I ever saw.

14
00:04:41,982 --> 00:04:43,942
Don't worry about it, Tommy.

15
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:48,155
You don't have to look pretty to
work down at the slaughterhouse.

16
00:06:55,741 --> 00:06:59,077
What is that diseased
freak still doing out here?

17
00:06:59,119 --> 00:07:01,329
We closed for good now.

18
00:07:01,371 --> 00:07:03,623
Uh, I think he likes it here, sir.

19
00:07:03,665 --> 00:07:06,835
Ain't no reason for that
ugly beast to still be here.

20
00:07:06,877 --> 00:07:10,338
Jess, we need to get that oversized
retard the hell out of here.

21
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:13,717
We, sir?

22
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,052
Just you.

23
00:07:25,929 --> 00:07:27,806
Hello, Hewitt.

24
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,269
We're shutting down the place today.

25
00:07:32,311 --> 00:07:33,896
You know that 'cause I done told you.

26
00:07:33,937 --> 00:07:35,939
Shutting down for good.

27
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:39,151
We ain't packing no more meat.

28
00:07:39,234 --> 00:07:41,612
Ain't killing no more animals so...

29
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:47,993
You just leave the equipment.
You just get on home now, okay?

30
00:07:48,035 --> 00:07:53,999
You gotta go, I said!

31
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,668
You gotta get the hell out
of here, you dumb animal!

32
00:08:34,456 --> 00:08:35,916
What are you doing?

33
00:08:38,627 --> 00:08:41,964
Shh! Keep your voice down.

34
00:08:41,964 --> 00:08:44,091
This is how you sneak up on 'em,

35
00:08:44,133 --> 00:08:47,094
How you catch 'em. Catch who?

36
00:08:48,679 --> 00:08:51,765
Gooks in the swamp.

37
00:08:51,807 --> 00:08:54,309
Eric, the only thing you're gonna
catch in this water is disease.

38
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:59,440
Chrissie, come on. No, I'm
not going in that water.

39
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,941
Consider it the last wish of a soldier.

40
00:09:00,983 --> 00:09:02,776
Oh, no.

41
00:09:02,818 --> 00:09:05,738
No, you've been getting last wishes
this whole past week, G.I. Joe.

42
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:08,991
And you call yourself a patriot.

43
00:09:09,032 --> 00:09:11,118
You know what I think
is patriotic? What?

44
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:15,539
Me driving you across state
to go to Vietnam. Again.

45
00:09:15,539 --> 00:09:16,832
You goin' all the way to Vietnam, baby?

46
00:09:16,874 --> 00:09:19,001
No, honey, base camp's far
enough for me, trust me.

47
00:09:22,004 --> 00:09:24,089
Just try to relax, baby,

48
00:09:24,131 --> 00:09:27,634
'Cause today I'm going to use my tongue

49
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,720
In ways the Lord never intended.

50
00:09:29,762 --> 00:09:32,806
How's that sound? Okay.

51
00:09:41,273 --> 00:09:43,358
Mmm...

52
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:59,374
This may come as a shock
to you, but most men

53
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,585
Are into this kind of thing.

54
00:10:03,879 --> 00:10:05,047
I'm sorry.

55
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,302
I'm just a little distracted, Bail.

56
00:10:12,888 --> 00:10:15,224
I mean, I just keep thinking,

57
00:10:15,265 --> 00:10:17,309
How does a person go back there?

58
00:10:17,392 --> 00:10:19,019
You know, how do you do that?

59
00:10:19,061 --> 00:10:22,147
It doesn't make him any more
heroic than you, baby, okay?

60
00:10:24,608 --> 00:10:26,693
Yeah, but he thinks I'm
going with him, Bail.

61
00:10:26,735 --> 00:10:30,948
Eric thinks I'm going
to Vietnam with him.

62
00:10:30,989 --> 00:10:34,701
Well, he's your brother, he loves you.

63
00:10:34,743 --> 00:10:37,788
You know, he'll get over it, okay?

64
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,210
Just close your eyes.

65
00:10:43,252 --> 00:10:46,213
Let me see your hand.

66
00:10:46,255 --> 00:10:48,382
You're gonna love this.

67
00:10:48,424 --> 00:10:49,883
Can I look?

68
00:10:49,925 --> 00:10:51,885
Yeah.

69
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:56,640
Eric, you got that
from a Cracker Jack box!

70
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:59,435
Wha... I... I had to eat 17
batches to find the one I wanted.

71
00:11:01,895 --> 00:11:04,314
How many?

72
00:11:04,398 --> 00:11:07,359
Two. Okay, girls or boys?

73
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:09,945
One of each.

74
00:11:10,028 --> 00:11:11,447
And what are their names?

75
00:11:11,488 --> 00:11:14,992
Bonnie and Clyde. No.

76
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:17,745
Come on. Bobby and Janis.

77
00:11:17,786 --> 00:11:20,497
And where are us and
the kids gonna live?

78
00:11:20,539 --> 00:11:24,126
California. Right by the water.

79
00:11:33,927 --> 00:11:35,471
Don't leave me.

80
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:40,225
I ain't never gonna
leave you, beautiful.

81
00:11:40,267 --> 00:11:44,605
I'll give you everything you want, baby.

82
00:11:44,646 --> 00:11:46,440
Starting with this.

83
00:11:48,609 --> 00:11:50,360
This is what you're gonna tell him...

84
00:11:50,402 --> 00:11:53,030
You're going to walk right up to Eric,

85
00:11:53,072 --> 00:11:55,240
And you're gonna tell him
that you're going to Mexico

86
00:11:55,282 --> 00:11:57,659
And you're not gonna join
him in this stupid war,

87
00:11:57,701 --> 00:12:00,120
No matter what some draft card says.

88
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,914
Okay?

89
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:07,920
Get your bony ass ready,
soldier! Moving out at 1700 hours.

90
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:10,506
What's 1700 hours?

91
00:12:10,547 --> 00:12:13,133
You better be getting some, Dean.

92
00:12:30,984 --> 00:12:33,112
What the hell are you still doing here?

93
00:12:33,153 --> 00:12:35,030
Go home. We're out of business.

94
00:12:35,072 --> 00:12:36,990
You and your family are
the only ones stupid enough

95
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:38,283
To still be living in this town.

96
00:12:38,325 --> 00:12:40,494
Your kind belong in this shithole.

97
00:12:59,805 --> 00:13:02,516
Operator.

98
00:13:02,558 --> 00:13:03,892
May I help you?

99
00:13:06,804 --> 00:13:09,098
You're gonna have to
speak more clearly, ma'am.

100
00:13:11,309 --> 00:13:14,562
I don't understand. You're
gonna have to speak more clearly.

101
00:13:14,604 --> 00:13:16,272
I'm your friend, Hewitt.

102
00:13:52,433 --> 00:13:55,228
Come on, y'all. Look alive now.

103
00:13:55,270 --> 00:13:56,980
Take one last look at
that motel over there

104
00:13:57,021 --> 00:13:58,856
'Cause this here's your
lodging for the next two days.

105
00:13:58,898 --> 00:14:00,984
What, are you gonna put
mints on our pillows too?

106
00:14:01,025 --> 00:14:02,902
I'll tuck you in special every night.

107
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,414
We're going on a road trip!

108
00:14:36,352 --> 00:14:37,645
So what are you gonna miss the most?

109
00:14:37,687 --> 00:14:39,147
Hmm? When you're gone,

110
00:14:39,188 --> 00:14:40,815
What are you gonna miss the most?

111
00:14:40,857 --> 00:14:42,442
Fishing for compliments here?

112
00:14:42,483 --> 00:14:43,985
No, never.

113
00:14:44,027 --> 00:14:46,195
She is fishing. I am not.

114
00:14:46,237 --> 00:14:47,488
Come on, tell me.

115
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:50,241
Besides you?

116
00:14:50,283 --> 00:14:52,118
Nothing.

117
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,329
I mean, family and all, sure,

118
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:57,040
But Dean's gonna be right there with me.

119
00:14:57,081 --> 00:15:00,126
Right, Deano? Hoo-Ha.

120
00:15:34,629 --> 00:15:38,132
Thomas in there? No, he ain't here.

121
00:15:38,174 --> 00:15:42,887
We got a... we got a
situation on our hands here.

122
00:15:42,929 --> 00:15:45,640
I just came back from
the slaughterhouse.

123
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,559
That 'tarded nephew
of yours killed a man.

124
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:51,479
Now I'm gonna have to apprehend him.

125
00:15:51,521 --> 00:15:53,564
I thought you might
want to accompany me,

126
00:15:53,606 --> 00:15:56,859
Help finesse the situation, as it were.

127
00:16:03,408 --> 00:16:05,786
Anyway, staying around this town,

128
00:16:05,827 --> 00:16:07,663
There's no more jobs, no more money,

129
00:16:07,704 --> 00:16:10,290
No more food. It's downright suicidal.

130
00:16:10,332 --> 00:16:13,418
And I'm the last bit of
law enforcement that's left.

131
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:16,213
Hell, I'm moving to Michigan next week.

132
00:16:16,255 --> 00:16:20,842
I often ask myself, "What
makes a man a killer?"

133
00:16:20,884 --> 00:16:24,263
I don't mind saying: You
raised that retard right,

134
00:16:24,304 --> 00:16:26,598
Me and you, we ain't
taking this drive right now.

135
00:16:26,598 --> 00:16:29,560
You can't have a creature
like that around normal folk,

136
00:16:29,601 --> 00:16:33,272
That's what I'm saying. He ain't
retarded. He's misunderstood.

137
00:16:34,731 --> 00:16:37,526
Oh, shit, there he is! Jesus Christ.

138
00:16:39,862 --> 00:16:41,697
You stay put.

139
00:16:41,738 --> 00:16:43,240
I'll let you know when I need you.

140
00:16:43,282 --> 00:16:45,742
Put down the weapon, boy!

141
00:16:48,078 --> 00:16:50,080
I seen what you did back there, Hewitt.

142
00:16:50,122 --> 00:16:54,001
This doesn't have to be
difficult unless'n you make it so.

143
00:16:54,001 --> 00:16:55,752
Just put the weapon down.

144
00:16:55,794 --> 00:16:59,339
Don't be stupid.

145
00:17:03,844 --> 00:17:05,721
I think we've got a problem, Sheriff.

146
00:17:15,355 --> 00:17:19,193
Shit, I just killed the whole
fucking sheriff's department.

147
00:17:19,234 --> 00:17:21,361
Damn, I wondered what that felt like.

148
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:15,916
You really think you're something
in that outfit, don't you?

149
00:18:15,958 --> 00:18:19,962
Here's your pants.
Supper's on the table.

150
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,553
Ladies love a man in uniform.

151
00:18:32,307 --> 00:18:36,853
That slaughterhouse meant more to this
town than them fools will ever know.

152
00:18:36,895 --> 00:18:39,106
Just a matter of time now

153
00:18:39,147 --> 00:18:42,276
Before this town's overrun
by bikers and hippies.

154
00:18:42,498 --> 00:18:45,560
Us, we're staying right here.

155
00:18:45,676 --> 00:18:49,930
We will never abandon
the place of our birth.

156
00:18:51,473 --> 00:18:54,310
We're on our own now, people.

157
00:18:54,351 --> 00:18:56,520
And alone

158
00:18:56,562 --> 00:18:59,690
We will rise above it all.

159
00:18:59,773 --> 00:19:04,195
People may not remember
what we say here tonight,

160
00:19:04,195 --> 00:19:08,574
But they sure as shit
gonna remember what we do.

161
00:19:08,574 --> 00:19:10,576
Thanks to the good sheriff here,

162
00:19:10,576 --> 00:19:13,287
We ain't gonna go hungry tonight.

163
00:19:13,329 --> 00:19:15,289
Matter of fact,

164
00:19:15,331 --> 00:19:17,750
We ain't never gonna starve again.

165
00:19:21,462 --> 00:19:23,422
Mm-Mm-Mm.

166
00:19:25,966 --> 00:19:29,511
Charlie, say grace.

167
00:19:29,553 --> 00:19:32,097
Mama, I told you Charlie's dead.

168
00:19:32,139 --> 00:19:35,601
It's Hoyt now, Sheriff Hoyt.

169
00:20:12,443 --> 00:20:14,779
Oh baby, look! Come on,
can we stop at that store?

170
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,297
It's just like the one
in California. Please?

171
00:20:16,339 --> 00:20:18,383
Yeah yeah.

172
00:20:26,641 --> 00:20:28,434
Come on, Bail, you'll love this.

173
00:20:28,476 --> 00:20:29,977
These places have tons of character.

174
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:55,378
Y'all have some beautiful
things in here, ma'am.

175
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:57,338
Okay...

176
00:21:04,137 --> 00:21:07,390
It'll take you a little while
to get used to things in 'Nam.

177
00:21:09,434 --> 00:21:10,852
The people,

178
00:21:10,893 --> 00:21:14,397
The smells, but...

179
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,567
But what?

180
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:20,319
You'd be amazed at the
things you can get used to.

181
00:21:22,613 --> 00:21:25,992
Um, is everything
okay with you and Dean?

182
00:21:26,034 --> 00:21:28,202
Uh, what do you mean?

183
00:21:28,244 --> 00:21:32,373
Bailey, come on. You guys have been
exchanging odd glances this whole trip.

184
00:21:32,415 --> 00:21:33,541
Oh...

185
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:38,671
Excuse me, ma'am, can you tell
me where the bathroom is, please?

186
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:41,924
Through the back.

187
00:21:53,432 --> 00:21:54,892
Come on, Bailey.

188
00:21:54,934 --> 00:21:56,936
Look, we've been through a lot together.

189
00:21:56,978 --> 00:21:58,271
Whatever it is, you can tell me.

190
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:03,734
Me and Dean are going to Mexico.

191
00:22:03,776 --> 00:22:05,987
He's not gonna go with Eric.

192
00:22:06,028 --> 00:22:08,531
And uh, he's not going to Vietnam.

193
00:22:08,573 --> 00:22:11,492
Chrissie...

194
00:22:11,534 --> 00:22:15,246
What do you have to say? I say, go.

195
00:22:15,288 --> 00:22:18,291
Get the hell away from this war,
okay? Just cling to what you got.

196
00:22:18,332 --> 00:22:21,460
Then why are you letting Eric go back?

197
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,213
It's just in him. What's in him?

198
00:22:24,255 --> 00:22:26,507
The war. What do you mean?

199
00:22:26,549 --> 00:22:29,885
Look, you do something long enough,
eventually you start to like it.

200
00:22:29,927 --> 00:22:31,345
Hah!

201
00:22:34,098 --> 00:22:35,933
Bitch. Scared the titties right off her.

202
00:22:39,061 --> 00:22:41,564
God damn it.

203
00:22:41,606 --> 00:22:42,940
Broke my mirror.

204
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,943
You think the girls
are gonna be all right

205
00:22:45,985 --> 00:22:48,154
Driving back alone
after they drop us off?

206
00:22:48,195 --> 00:22:51,657
Oh, I'm not worried about them, Dean.

207
00:22:57,038 --> 00:22:58,956
Are you sure you got nothing to tell me?

208
00:23:02,585 --> 00:23:05,421
Can we go?

209
00:23:05,463 --> 00:23:07,131
You all right?

210
00:23:07,173 --> 00:23:10,217
Yeah... let's just go.

211
00:23:20,019 --> 00:23:21,854
You didn't even buy anything, baby.

212
00:23:21,896 --> 00:23:25,942
Yeah, it was... it was nothing
like the one in California.

213
00:23:25,983 --> 00:23:28,945
I guess we'll just have to
go back to that one then.

214
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:38,287
What are you doing, man?

215
00:23:38,329 --> 00:23:40,581
What the hell are you
doing? I'm not going, Eric.

216
00:23:40,623 --> 00:23:42,250
What do you mean, you're not going?

217
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:43,668
I'm not going, Eric!

218
00:23:46,712 --> 00:23:49,215
You think I don't
hear you at night, man,

219
00:23:49,257 --> 00:23:52,134
In your sleep, wailing from
what you've done over there?

220
00:23:52,176 --> 00:23:54,178
Now, how could you want that for me?

221
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,472
I'm glad Dad's not here to see this.

222
00:23:56,514 --> 00:23:58,933
What, his son the coward?

223
00:24:00,685 --> 00:24:02,436
Well, guess what,
Eric, I am not like you!

224
00:24:02,478 --> 00:24:04,272
All right?

225
00:24:04,313 --> 00:24:06,023
I am not ready for this
shit! I have no problem

226
00:24:06,065 --> 00:24:08,568
With the Vietcong over
in Vietnam or whatever...

227
00:24:08,609 --> 00:24:10,695
What the hell do you think
I'm going back for, huh?

228
00:24:10,736 --> 00:24:12,863
I'm going back for you! Stop it!

229
00:24:15,074 --> 00:24:16,993
You think you're the only
one who's ever been scared?

230
00:24:17,034 --> 00:24:19,036
You think I wasn't scared?
You think I'm still not scared?

231
00:24:19,078 --> 00:24:20,121
Shut up!

232
00:24:21,914 --> 00:24:23,374
What does she want?

233
00:24:25,710 --> 00:24:27,962
Pull over! Pull over!

234
00:24:28,004 --> 00:24:29,964
Oh God. Jesus Christ, don't pull over!

235
00:24:30,006 --> 00:24:31,424
Shit, she's got a gun, Eric.

236
00:24:31,465 --> 00:24:33,301
Eric!

237
00:24:33,301 --> 00:24:36,387
Shut up! Stay calm.

238
00:24:36,429 --> 00:24:39,015
What are we gonna do?
Eric, she's pulling...

239
00:24:41,517 --> 00:24:43,019
Oh my God!

240
00:24:44,353 --> 00:24:47,523
Look out!

241
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,584
God...

242
00:25:09,295 --> 00:25:11,339
Chrissie.

243
00:25:21,098 --> 00:25:23,893
Buddy, Dean, Deano...

244
00:25:23,935 --> 00:25:27,813
I'm gonna get you help.
I'm gonna find Chrissie.

245
00:25:29,815 --> 00:25:30,942
Chrissie!

246
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:36,948
Wow, man, I am impressed.

247
00:25:36,989 --> 00:25:39,367
Y'all are tougher than I
thought. What do you want from us?

248
00:25:39,408 --> 00:25:41,035
Oh... everything.

249
00:25:41,077 --> 00:25:45,539
How about we get this robbery
thing out of the way, huh?

250
00:26:00,012 --> 00:26:01,806
Fuck.

251
00:26:01,847 --> 00:26:06,519
You play along, and I won't have to
kill this fucking cop or you. Get up!

252
00:26:21,826 --> 00:26:23,411
I'm glad you're here, officer.

253
00:26:23,452 --> 00:26:25,830
Oh, I just bet you are.

254
00:26:28,499 --> 00:26:30,710
Whoa!

255
00:26:35,214 --> 00:26:36,340
Sir.

256
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:38,467
You sit down and you stay right there.

257
00:26:43,723 --> 00:26:46,684
You kids okay?

258
00:26:46,684 --> 00:26:49,687
Why don't you step out of
the car, if you don't mind?

259
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:52,523
He shot her! He shot her! She
can't move, sir. She needs help.

260
00:26:52,523 --> 00:26:54,692
Sir, I can't find my girlfriend.

261
00:26:54,775 --> 00:26:57,403
Get a grip on yourself, son.

262
00:26:57,445 --> 00:27:00,072
Sir, I can't find...

263
00:27:00,114 --> 00:27:03,284
Now, that was for your own good.

264
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:09,090
Okay, come on kids. Let's
get out of the car now.

265
00:27:09,132 --> 00:27:11,175
Sir, she's... she's really badly hurt.

266
00:27:11,217 --> 00:27:14,053
Right, well okay, kids.

267
00:27:14,095 --> 00:27:17,056
I'm gonna ask you nicely one more time.

268
00:27:17,098 --> 00:27:21,936
Get out of the fuckin' car or I'm
gonna blow your fuckin' head off.

269
00:27:23,229 --> 00:27:27,267
Come on, you can make it. Ooh-Ee!

270
00:27:27,308 --> 00:27:30,019
You kids must have been hauling ass.

271
00:27:30,061 --> 00:27:32,063
Look at the fucking mess you made.

272
00:27:32,105 --> 00:27:35,567
Hey....

273
00:27:37,722 --> 00:27:39,891
There ain't no fire in this accident.

274
00:27:39,932 --> 00:27:42,977
Which one of you assholes
burned his draft card?

275
00:27:43,019 --> 00:27:44,854
Get on over here, boys.

276
00:27:46,606 --> 00:27:49,192
Come on, get over here. No.

277
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:50,485
God damn it, get over here!

278
00:27:56,616 --> 00:28:00,620
Which one of you boys'
name is Dean Hill?

279
00:28:04,082 --> 00:28:07,335
Honey, you're name ain't Dean, is it?

280
00:28:17,011 --> 00:28:18,679
I am, sir...

281
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:20,640
I'm Dean.

282
00:28:25,353 --> 00:28:29,649
Well, hey, dean. Good to meet you.

283
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:32,110
You kids took one

284
00:28:32,151 --> 00:28:35,279
Big, nasty, giant shit

285
00:28:35,321 --> 00:28:38,199
Right in my backyard.

286
00:28:38,241 --> 00:28:42,995
Now we do know that you're
a coward, right, Dean?

287
00:28:43,037 --> 00:28:46,124
I'm gonna to give you
a chance to die a hero.

288
00:28:50,128 --> 00:28:52,338
All right, get her
in there, God damn it.

289
00:28:52,338 --> 00:28:56,676
I'm starting to think you
like wasting my time, blondie.

290
00:28:56,717 --> 00:28:58,261
Hurry up!

291
00:29:05,184 --> 00:29:07,019
I saw Chrissie. You did?

292
00:29:07,061 --> 00:29:08,688
She's okay. Just don't say anything.

293
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:10,732
Where is she? Shut up.

294
00:29:37,425 --> 00:29:40,511
Hey, Monty, come pick
up this damn wreck.

295
00:29:40,553 --> 00:29:42,930
It's about a quarter mile
south of Hodd's place.

296
00:29:42,972 --> 00:29:45,641
There's a motorcycle too.

297
00:29:45,683 --> 00:29:49,979
Is having a dead biker chick ride
shotgun proper police procedure, sir?

298
00:29:51,522 --> 00:29:54,108
Honey, if that was your mama,

299
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:58,112
Would you want me to stick her
in the trunk like a dead animal?

300
00:29:58,154 --> 00:29:59,989
I just think this is bullshit.

301
00:29:59,989 --> 00:30:03,451
You got something to say about
this bullshit, do you, Dean?

302
00:30:03,493 --> 00:30:05,078
No, sir.

303
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:09,582
You wouldn't lie to me, would you, Dean?

304
00:31:31,748 --> 00:31:34,375
Where is the gun?

305
00:31:47,555 --> 00:31:50,058
You look through all
this shit on the road?

306
00:31:50,099 --> 00:31:54,187
Is that how we agreed you'd address
me over official FCC airwaves?

307
00:31:54,228 --> 00:31:56,939
No, "Sheriff."

308
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:32,600
Oh...

309
00:32:34,894 --> 00:32:37,647
Pretty little rascal, ain't you?

310
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:12,409
And what brings you kids here?

311
00:33:14,786 --> 00:33:16,913
Sir, we were just passing through,

312
00:33:16,955 --> 00:33:19,040
On my way to reenlist, sir.

313
00:33:19,293 --> 00:33:21,012
You look kind of young to me.

314
00:33:21,254 --> 00:33:24,090
Where was you stationed?

315
00:33:24,131 --> 00:33:26,259
Vietnam, sir.

316
00:33:26,300 --> 00:33:30,304
Vietnam. Really?

317
00:33:31,764 --> 00:33:33,558
You kill any commies?

318
00:33:33,599 --> 00:33:36,852
Uh, a handful of gooks, sir.

319
00:33:39,939 --> 00:33:41,107
Where are you taking us?

320
00:33:41,148 --> 00:33:43,651
Where are you taking us, sir?

321
00:33:45,069 --> 00:33:46,696
How was it over there?

322
00:33:48,948 --> 00:33:53,202
Well, it's a... it's
a different culture.

323
00:33:53,244 --> 00:33:56,831
But you'd be amazed at the things
you get used to over there, sir.

324
00:33:56,872 --> 00:33:59,083
You don't say.

325
00:34:04,463 --> 00:34:07,633
This the sheriff station?

326
00:34:07,675 --> 00:34:11,220
No, it's Mama's house.

327
00:34:19,478 --> 00:34:21,689
Oh! Don't even think about it here.

328
00:34:28,112 --> 00:34:29,655
What are we gonna do?

329
00:34:29,697 --> 00:34:32,700
I'm gonna kill this motherfucker.

330
00:34:43,377 --> 00:34:45,046
Hey!

331
00:34:45,212 --> 00:34:49,592
You kids best not be making a mess
in my car or you'll clean it up.

332
00:34:50,635 --> 00:34:53,221
He knows, Eric. What?

333
00:34:53,221 --> 00:34:54,805
He knows you're not me.

334
00:34:54,847 --> 00:34:56,641
No, he doesn't, Dean. Hey, Tommy!

335
00:34:56,682 --> 00:34:58,351
Stay the course. We're out here!

336
00:34:58,351 --> 00:35:01,020
Come on, boy, get over here!

337
00:35:01,062 --> 00:35:03,564
What is that? Get the
lead out of your ass!

338
00:35:03,606 --> 00:35:06,484
Come on, big guy!

339
00:35:06,525 --> 00:35:08,152
What is that?

340
00:35:12,657 --> 00:35:14,116
Go ahead, get her on out of there.

341
00:35:34,345 --> 00:35:35,638
Come on, private!

342
00:35:50,861 --> 00:35:52,738
Oh my God.

343
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:54,323
I'm gonna get us out of here, okay?

344
00:35:57,243 --> 00:35:59,495
Dean! Stay with me!

345
00:35:59,537 --> 00:36:01,622
I need you to be a soldier.

346
00:36:01,664 --> 00:36:05,668
People are gonna come
looking for 'em, I know it.

347
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:07,878
You have made a big mistake!

348
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,214
Boy, are you dumb.

349
00:36:10,256 --> 00:36:12,592
Nobody's gonna miss those
creatures, not one person.

350
00:36:12,758 --> 00:36:15,177
Not now, not when they gone.

351
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:50,379
Let's see. Anything in here?

352
00:36:50,379 --> 00:36:53,341
A bunch of shit.

353
00:37:17,782 --> 00:37:20,576
Oh...

354
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:24,455
You little bastard, I know
you've got more in there.

355
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:49,105
Come on, Tommy, ain't no
different than the slaughterhouse.

356
00:37:49,146 --> 00:37:53,317
Meat's meat, bones bones.

357
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,152
Get it done.

358
00:38:00,366 --> 00:38:03,411
My daddy always told me

359
00:38:03,452 --> 00:38:07,415
That if you want to be a good farmer
you gotta keep your livestock clean.

360
00:38:11,252 --> 00:38:13,879
Clean goat is a happy goat.

361
00:38:13,921 --> 00:38:16,340
What the hell do you want from us, man?

362
00:38:16,382 --> 00:38:18,342
Are you happy yet?

363
00:38:43,868 --> 00:38:45,828
Hey!

364
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:54,420
H... hey, help us. Help us down, please.

365
00:38:58,633 --> 00:39:02,178
I don't get involved in his affairs. No.

366
00:39:27,078 --> 00:39:29,080
Please, help me.

367
00:39:31,666 --> 00:39:34,335
Please, please.

368
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:42,268
I didn't know. Didn't know what?

369
00:39:44,061 --> 00:39:46,022
I didn't know you were
going back there for me.

370
00:39:46,147 --> 00:39:49,192
Let's figure out how to
get out of here, Dean.

371
00:39:51,486 --> 00:39:54,530
By God, I'm gonna make
a soldier out of you yet!

372
00:39:56,782 --> 00:39:59,986
No! Please, please!

373
00:40:00,128 --> 00:40:02,714
Are you ashamed of your country, Dean?

374
00:40:02,755 --> 00:40:05,425
No, please! No!

375
00:40:08,469 --> 00:40:10,305
What do you think, soldier?

376
00:40:10,346 --> 00:40:14,517
What would be the proper
punishment for treason?

377
00:40:14,559 --> 00:40:17,103
Just please let him go, sir. No!

378
00:40:18,938 --> 00:40:22,775
I can't make out a word you're
saying, you know it, asshole?

379
00:40:22,817 --> 00:40:24,902
You're killing him, sir! Please!

380
00:40:24,944 --> 00:40:28,323
No no no! Please, sir!

381
00:40:29,574 --> 00:40:33,703
Ain't nothing I hate worse than
a draft-Dodging hippie protester.

382
00:40:33,745 --> 00:40:35,163
I'm Dean!

383
00:40:35,246 --> 00:40:36,956
It was my draft card!

384
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,042
It was my draft card!
It was my draft card!

385
00:40:39,083 --> 00:40:42,170
And you'd just stand
here and let him die.

386
00:40:42,211 --> 00:40:45,173
Sir, could you let him breathe, please?

387
00:40:45,214 --> 00:40:47,717
Please, can you let him breathe?

388
00:40:47,759 --> 00:40:49,969
My apologies. Eric!

389
00:40:53,139 --> 00:40:56,142
Oh shit!

390
00:40:56,184 --> 00:41:00,229
Well, so now you want to
play soldier. Is that it?

391
00:41:09,489 --> 00:41:11,449
Your brother saved your life.

392
00:41:11,491 --> 00:41:15,411
I'm gonna fucking cut your head off.

393
00:41:15,453 --> 00:41:19,040
Yeah, you just keep
sweet-Talking me, dumpling.

394
00:41:35,932 --> 00:41:39,185
Help me!

395
00:41:46,943 --> 00:41:51,155
Back in 1952, Korean War,

396
00:41:51,197 --> 00:41:53,783
Yours truly was a P.O.W.

397
00:41:53,825 --> 00:41:55,952
That's "prisoner of war" for you,

398
00:41:55,994 --> 00:41:57,787
And I know what in the
hell I'm talking about.

399
00:41:57,915 --> 00:42:01,084
Back in those days
there wasn't no rules.

400
00:42:01,126 --> 00:42:04,004
No regulations like there are today.

401
00:42:04,087 --> 00:42:07,666
You got captured, you had two choices:

402
00:42:07,766 --> 00:42:11,312
You starve to death or survive.

403
00:42:14,390 --> 00:42:18,811
Now, you had to eat.
Rations were scarce.

404
00:42:18,853 --> 00:42:22,857
So, well, about once a week

405
00:42:22,898 --> 00:42:26,527
Some poor soul was chosen.

406
00:42:28,112 --> 00:42:30,114
Chosen?

407
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:37,507
Why are you doing this?

408
00:42:37,649 --> 00:42:40,568
Got to get you cleaned up.

409
00:42:40,878 --> 00:42:42,671
We're gonna have company.

410
00:42:42,713 --> 00:42:46,133
You don't want to look
dirty for company, do you?

411
00:42:46,175 --> 00:42:47,760
Huh?

412
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,639
This is your lucky day!

413
00:42:53,306 --> 00:42:57,143
How would you like to just
stand right up here today

414
00:42:57,185 --> 00:42:59,980
And just walk right on out of here, huh?

415
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:02,649
I'd like that, Sheriff.

416
00:43:02,691 --> 00:43:07,195
Yeah, well, freedom ain't free.
You know that, right? I tell you what...

417
00:43:07,249 --> 00:43:11,619
10 push-Ups stand
between you and freedom here today.

418
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:15,973
This shit is what heroes
are made of, you know?

419
00:43:16,015 --> 00:43:18,851
Well, come on, I'm waiting!

420
00:43:18,893 --> 00:43:20,895
Let's get with the program, sunshine!

421
00:43:20,936 --> 00:43:23,355
Come on, you can do it!
Get those push-Ups now!

422
00:43:23,397 --> 00:43:24,940
No!

423
00:43:24,982 --> 00:43:28,152
Shh, now don't cry.

424
00:43:28,193 --> 00:43:29,403
Don't cry.

425
00:43:33,657 --> 00:43:35,534
No.

426
00:43:35,576 --> 00:43:36,744
No!

427
00:43:36,785 --> 00:43:40,247
You shut your cocksucker,
you son of a bitch!

428
00:43:41,874 --> 00:43:44,001
One!

429
00:43:44,084 --> 00:43:47,630
Whoa, that was a really
fine push-Up there. One...

430
00:43:50,049 --> 00:43:51,284
Two...

431
00:43:51,326 --> 00:43:55,538
We've got ourselves a regular
American hero here, ain't we?

432
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:56,864
Three.

433
00:43:56,906 --> 00:43:58,616
Come on, sweetheart.

434
00:44:06,833 --> 00:44:08,292
Ow!

435
00:44:12,922 --> 00:44:15,424
Eight.

436
00:44:17,953 --> 00:44:19,537
What's it gonna be?

437
00:44:19,579 --> 00:44:22,374
You're gonna be the
motherfucker who eats?

438
00:44:22,415 --> 00:44:25,877
Or are you gonna be the
poor sorry motherfucker

439
00:44:25,919 --> 00:44:27,254
Who gets ate?

440
00:44:38,557 --> 00:44:41,351
Don't give up, Dean!
Show this motherfucker!

441
00:44:41,393 --> 00:44:43,436
Show me that you ain't as fucked up

442
00:44:43,478 --> 00:44:45,981
As the rest of your
useless goddamn generation.

443
00:44:45,981 --> 00:44:47,440
Eight!

444
00:44:49,818 --> 00:44:52,529
Come on! Nine...

445
00:44:55,991 --> 00:44:57,075
Go!

446
00:45:00,620 --> 00:45:03,623
That's only half of one.
That don't count, boy!

447
00:45:04,875 --> 00:45:06,543
Don't give up, Dean!

448
00:45:12,091 --> 00:45:13,425
10. Yeah!

449
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:15,886
Don't cry.

450
00:45:16,929 --> 00:45:18,097
No!

451
00:45:18,138 --> 00:45:22,434
No. I never had me a little girl.

452
00:45:24,269 --> 00:45:26,480
Got more guts than I
thought you had, boy.

453
00:45:26,522 --> 00:45:29,900
I'm a man of my word. You're free to go.

454
00:45:31,610 --> 00:45:34,321
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

455
00:45:34,363 --> 00:45:37,741
My money says he ain't going nowhere.

456
00:45:56,218 --> 00:45:58,178
Stop!

457
00:45:58,178 --> 00:46:01,432
Please, stop!

458
00:46:01,473 --> 00:46:04,017
Stop!

459
00:46:04,184 --> 00:46:06,437
Please stop!

460
00:46:10,232 --> 00:46:12,651
Look... my friends, they...

461
00:46:12,735 --> 00:46:15,654
They have my friends, okay? They're in
a house over there through the woods. I...

462
00:46:17,114 --> 00:46:21,493
Look, they have your friend.
They took your friend.

463
00:46:22,578 --> 00:46:23,829
I saw you both at the store.

464
00:46:23,871 --> 00:46:27,499
He shot her. The sheriff shot her.

465
00:46:35,007 --> 00:46:36,800
Show me where.

466
00:46:45,684 --> 00:46:49,354
Weather has been so hot lately.

467
00:46:49,396 --> 00:46:52,775
It's important to drink
your liquids, you know?

468
00:46:52,816 --> 00:46:56,403
The body needs to hydrate.

469
00:46:58,304 --> 00:47:01,304
Yeah I see.

470
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:06,651
I got me some of that breakfast tea...

471
00:47:06,762 --> 00:47:09,125
Jar of ice with plenty of sugar.

472
00:47:09,213 --> 00:47:12,258
Tastes like heaven.

473
00:47:19,491 --> 00:47:21,660
Dean. Dean!

474
00:47:51,907 --> 00:47:55,286
Dean, you did good.
But we gotta hide, okay?

475
00:47:56,454 --> 00:48:00,082
Come on! Come on!

476
00:48:05,997 --> 00:48:08,332
Do you have any idea
where the hell we're going?

477
00:48:08,374 --> 00:48:10,501
Yes, it's...

478
00:48:10,543 --> 00:48:12,920
It's here somewhere.

479
00:48:15,298 --> 00:48:17,175
Sometimes...

480
00:48:17,216 --> 00:48:20,428
I just can't stop eating
them little chocolates.

481
00:48:20,470 --> 00:48:23,514
They're so good.

482
00:48:23,598 --> 00:48:25,099
I put coconut in them.

483
00:48:25,141 --> 00:48:27,560
Oh, sweet Jesus.

484
00:48:31,189 --> 00:48:33,191
Hoyt! Hoyt!

485
00:48:33,274 --> 00:48:36,319
Come here! Hoyt!

486
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:38,154
Hoyt! Hoyt!

487
00:48:39,822 --> 00:48:42,075
Eric!

488
00:48:42,116 --> 00:48:45,620
He's in here! Eric! Get me out of here!

489
00:48:48,790 --> 00:48:51,417
Shut your mouth! Oh, my!

490
00:48:51,459 --> 00:48:53,795
He's here! He's here! He's here!

491
00:48:53,836 --> 00:48:55,797
Help! Help!

492
00:48:55,838 --> 00:48:58,633
There's keys over there on the counter.

493
00:49:02,053 --> 00:49:04,806
Damn you! A man's home
is his fucking castle!

494
00:49:04,847 --> 00:49:08,184
What the fuck are you
doing in here? Oh no!

495
00:49:10,603 --> 00:49:12,063
Hey!

496
00:49:15,983 --> 00:49:17,985
Find the truck. Go! I'll
get Dean! I'll get Dean!

497
00:49:17,985 --> 00:49:20,279
Unlock the door!

498
00:49:23,199 --> 00:49:28,204
Thomas, Thomas, get up here! I need you!

499
00:49:50,601 --> 00:49:53,271
Come on, Dean, come on.

500
00:49:57,358 --> 00:50:00,194
Hey! Get back here, you skinny bitch!

501
00:50:23,426 --> 00:50:24,761
No!

502
00:50:24,802 --> 00:50:28,514
Come on, we're gonna get out of here.

503
00:50:30,349 --> 00:50:33,102
Dean, go! Go! Come on!

504
00:50:33,144 --> 00:50:35,188
Shoot me, you asshole!

505
00:50:35,229 --> 00:50:39,400
You're not a soldier! You hold
that gun like a fucking girl!

506
00:50:39,442 --> 00:50:40,693
Get out of my way.

507
00:50:40,735 --> 00:50:42,737
You're not a candy-Ass,
are you, Sheriff?

508
00:50:42,779 --> 00:50:45,698
Pull the fucking trigger!

509
00:50:46,866 --> 00:50:49,077
I ain't finished with you yet.

510
00:50:52,955 --> 00:50:57,543
Well... let's just go
see if we caught anything.

511
00:51:12,725 --> 00:51:14,227
Well well well...

512
00:51:14,268 --> 00:51:17,146
It's a good thing you
didn't go to Vietnam.

513
00:51:17,188 --> 00:51:21,943
Something like this might've happened.

514
00:51:35,990 --> 00:51:38,660
You don't like playing with
me anymore because I'm a pussy.

515
00:51:38,660 --> 00:51:40,161
That's what you said.

516
00:51:40,161 --> 00:51:42,622
Well, my nephew Tommy ain't no pussy.

517
00:51:42,664 --> 00:51:45,041
Maybe you want to play
with him for a little while.

518
00:52:12,777 --> 00:52:14,070
That's it.

519
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,075
Okay, so what are we gonna do?

520
00:52:19,117 --> 00:52:21,202
We? I'm gonna get my girlfriend.

521
00:52:21,244 --> 00:52:23,872
No no, look. What about my friends?

522
00:52:23,913 --> 00:52:26,624
What? My friends.

523
00:52:26,666 --> 00:52:28,543
Fuck your friends.

524
00:52:28,585 --> 00:52:30,920
You're on your own.

525
00:52:30,962 --> 00:52:33,006
You asshole!

526
00:52:51,691 --> 00:52:52,650
Shit.

527
00:53:33,233 --> 00:53:37,529
Dean, Dean. Oh fuck. Thank God.

528
00:53:38,655 --> 00:53:39,989
What happened?

529
00:53:40,031 --> 00:53:42,492
Chrissie. Oh, thank
God. Oh, Jesus Christ.

530
00:53:42,534 --> 00:53:45,078
No no no. Don't! I'm sorry.

531
00:53:45,120 --> 00:53:47,789
Just stay still. Okay,
are you okay? You're okay.

532
00:53:47,831 --> 00:53:49,749
They're psycho.

533
00:53:49,791 --> 00:53:52,210
Come on, where's Eric
and Bailey? Come on.

534
00:53:52,252 --> 00:53:55,630
In the house.

535
00:53:55,672 --> 00:53:57,882
You need to go get help, Chrissie.

536
00:53:57,966 --> 00:53:58,967
Okay?

537
00:53:59,008 --> 00:54:01,553
There's no help to go for.

538
00:54:04,055 --> 00:54:08,184
I have to go in there. You're gonna
stay here. I'm gonna come get you, okay?

539
00:54:08,226 --> 00:54:10,061
Okay.

540
00:54:11,563 --> 00:54:14,149
Don't you think you're
gonna go anyplace, huh?

541
00:54:24,451 --> 00:54:26,495
I love you.

542
00:55:01,989 --> 00:55:04,950
No! Come on! You don't... you
don't have to do this, man, please.

543
00:55:04,992 --> 00:55:08,036
No! No. No!

544
00:55:09,454 --> 00:55:11,164
No!

545
00:55:13,083 --> 00:55:15,168
You don't have to do this.

546
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:18,630
You son of a bitch!

547
00:55:23,218 --> 00:55:24,845
Fuck you!

548
00:55:26,680 --> 00:55:28,890
Fucker.

549
00:56:46,176 --> 00:56:48,220
Huh?

550
00:57:59,041 --> 00:58:00,542
What the fuck...

551
00:58:01,835 --> 00:58:04,588
Oh shit!

552
00:58:04,588 --> 00:58:08,550
Uh, he shot me! Uh! Shut up! Shut up!

553
00:58:08,592 --> 00:58:10,636
Where's the girl?

554
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:12,638
I'm gonna blow your head off.
Tell me where the girl is.

555
00:58:14,264 --> 00:58:17,559
I'm shot! Shit!

556
00:58:17,601 --> 00:58:21,188
How many times I gotta tell
you not to play with guns?

557
00:58:21,229 --> 00:58:24,107
Oh, Jesus, oh...

558
00:58:24,107 --> 00:58:25,734
Now look what you've done to yourself.

559
00:58:25,776 --> 00:58:29,279
I didn't do it. Stop your
damn whining, Uncle Monty.

560
00:58:29,279 --> 00:58:31,406
Mama, get some towels in here.

561
00:58:31,448 --> 00:58:33,408
Uncle Monty made a mess.

562
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:35,035
Sheriff.

563
00:58:35,077 --> 00:58:36,870
Who in the hell are you?

564
00:58:36,912 --> 00:58:39,331
What do you want, boy? I want my girl.

565
00:58:40,540 --> 00:58:43,418
Take me to her or I'm
gonna blow your head off.

566
00:58:43,460 --> 00:58:45,045
Okay, all right.

567
00:58:46,505 --> 00:58:48,840
Where is she? Thomas!

568
00:58:48,882 --> 00:58:52,177
Hey! Do not fuck around.
Where is the girl?

569
00:58:52,219 --> 00:58:54,763
Come on.

570
00:59:09,695 --> 00:59:12,072
Help me!

571
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:15,450
Thomas!

572
00:59:21,248 --> 00:59:22,457
Thomas!

573
00:59:22,499 --> 00:59:24,293
Thomas, where're you at?

574
01:00:12,883 --> 01:00:15,761
Eric, are you okay?

575
01:00:15,761 --> 01:00:18,263
What are you doing here?
You gotta get out of here.

576
01:00:18,305 --> 01:00:21,558
You're... you're gonna be
okay. How bad is it? Tell me.

577
01:00:24,937 --> 01:00:27,230
No! No! It's all right. I can't feel it.

578
01:00:27,272 --> 01:00:29,900
I'm gonna get you... it's
okay. Did he cut it off?

579
01:00:29,942 --> 01:00:31,526
It's okay. I can't feel it.

580
01:00:31,568 --> 01:00:32,945
No! No!

581
01:00:38,450 --> 01:00:40,953
I'm cold.

582
01:00:40,953 --> 01:00:45,165
How... how many?

583
01:00:45,207 --> 01:00:49,002
Three. Boys or girls?

584
01:00:49,044 --> 01:00:52,130
All boys.

585
01:00:52,172 --> 01:00:53,298
What are their names?

586
01:00:53,340 --> 01:00:58,303
Paul and Christopher...

587
01:00:58,345 --> 01:00:59,638
And Eric.

588
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:01,765
Okay. Okay. It's gonna be okay.

589
01:01:01,807 --> 01:01:04,476
I promise. I promise, okay?

590
01:01:05,602 --> 01:01:08,480
Take it easy. There she is.

591
01:01:10,357 --> 01:01:11,608
Help me.

592
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:14,027
That's not her.

593
01:01:14,069 --> 01:01:16,488
Shit, that ain't her.

594
01:01:16,488 --> 01:01:19,449
You don't want to see the other girl.

595
01:01:19,491 --> 01:01:20,909
Just shoot him!

596
01:01:20,951 --> 01:01:23,829
You dumb son of a bitch.

597
01:01:28,417 --> 01:01:31,086
Get him, Tommy, come on!

598
01:01:39,595 --> 01:01:41,046
Damn it! Come on, Tommy.

599
01:01:41,188 --> 01:01:42,439
This is one of those assholes

600
01:01:42,481 --> 01:01:44,858
Who used to fuck with you
in the schoolyard, Tommy.

601
01:01:44,900 --> 01:01:49,071
Come on, Tommy, get over
here! Get that thing going!

602
01:01:49,071 --> 01:01:51,073
Let's go, Tommy! Come on!

603
01:01:55,786 --> 01:01:58,539
Crank it up! Let's go!

604
01:01:58,580 --> 01:02:00,457
What it is, asshole!

605
01:02:00,499 --> 01:02:02,084
Yeah!

606
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:28,586
You beautiful bastard, you!

607
01:02:30,715 --> 01:02:32,759
You fucking asshole!

608
01:02:32,800 --> 01:02:36,721
You son of a bitch! Comin'
in my fucking house...

609
01:02:47,648 --> 01:02:49,650
Oh, God.

610
01:02:49,692 --> 01:02:51,235
You have to get out of here.

611
01:02:51,277 --> 01:02:53,988
No no no! Get out of here.

612
01:02:54,029 --> 01:02:56,657
No! Yes, Chrissie, please.

613
01:02:59,118 --> 01:03:01,120
Hide!

614
01:03:45,581 --> 01:03:48,501
What are you doing?

615
01:03:48,542 --> 01:03:51,462
Don't. No. What are you...

616
01:03:57,426 --> 01:03:59,720
No!

617
01:06:14,846 --> 01:06:18,767
Thomas! Tommy.

618
01:06:18,808 --> 01:06:22,270
Thomas, quit playing with your
fucking dolls and get up here!

619
01:06:27,943 --> 01:06:31,738
I'm glad you brought your little buddy.

620
01:06:31,780 --> 01:06:34,950
Hmm, I like your new face.

621
01:06:36,284 --> 01:06:37,369
Come on, Tommy, get up here.

622
01:07:52,402 --> 01:07:56,031
Please! Please!

623
01:07:56,072 --> 01:08:01,453
Help!

624
01:08:28,271 --> 01:08:32,859
Please, please, somebody help!

625
01:08:32,901 --> 01:08:36,404
Now this will take your
fever down, all right?

626
01:08:38,531 --> 01:08:40,242
See what you've done?

627
01:08:40,283 --> 01:08:45,080
You killed that sheriff and you
started up a whole whirlwind.

628
01:08:45,121 --> 01:08:48,083
Mama, please stop your damn bellyaching.

629
01:08:50,085 --> 01:08:53,296
Uncle Monty, I love you.

630
01:08:53,296 --> 01:08:56,508
You know that, and I always do
what's right by you, don't I?

631
01:08:56,550 --> 01:08:58,093
And you trust me, don't you?

632
01:08:58,134 --> 01:09:00,428
Yeah, I trust you. Just do something.

633
01:09:00,470 --> 01:09:02,430
Take care of you.

634
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:04,266
Get in here, boy!

635
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:06,393
Uh! Ow! Oh, I'm sorry.

636
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:08,436
Tommy!

637
01:09:10,981 --> 01:09:14,109
Now, this ain't gonna hurt... Huh?

638
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,944
...much.

639
01:09:17,588 --> 01:09:19,089
What's that on your face?

640
01:09:19,531 --> 01:09:21,616
Mama, you get over there
and hold Uncle Monty.

641
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:24,703
Why? 'Cause he ain't
gonna like this much,

642
01:09:24,744 --> 01:09:26,413
That's why.

643
01:09:26,454 --> 01:09:28,582
No! What the fuck is this?

644
01:09:28,623 --> 01:09:30,292
Surgery. Come on, Tommy.

645
01:09:30,333 --> 01:09:33,336
No! Oh my God!

646
01:09:38,216 --> 01:09:41,136
Oh, bullshit. Look at that!

647
01:09:41,177 --> 01:09:43,263
Now, Tommy, that's goddamn sloppy.

648
01:09:43,305 --> 01:09:45,515
That'll get infected.
Even him up. Come on.

649
01:09:45,557 --> 01:09:48,351
Huh? What?

650
01:09:48,351 --> 01:09:51,605
Sheriff, no, stop! No!

651
01:09:56,174 --> 01:09:58,134
There you go. Nice work, Tommy.

652
01:09:58,176 --> 01:10:00,220
What did you do that for?

653
01:10:01,387 --> 01:10:03,223
Balance.

654
01:10:05,235 --> 01:10:07,695
I'll get Tommy to wrap this up.

655
01:11:17,239 --> 01:11:18,615
Please, somebody help.

656
01:11:34,339 --> 01:11:37,175
Okay. Shh.

657
01:11:36,275 --> 01:11:38,111
You're gonna be okay, okay?

658
01:11:38,152 --> 01:11:39,988
Shh shh, I'm sorry.

659
01:11:42,991 --> 01:11:46,160
It's okay. You're safe.

660
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:49,080
They know you're here.

661
01:11:53,251 --> 01:11:56,129
I'll have Mama throw on
another plate for supper.

662
01:11:56,170 --> 01:11:59,215
You... you can stay?

663
01:12:09,409 --> 01:12:12,871
I think we need a little
more garlic in this one.

664
01:12:12,913 --> 01:12:15,999
Mama, a little more garlic in this one.

665
01:12:20,420 --> 01:12:23,048
I'll go set the table.

666
01:12:25,008 --> 01:12:26,968
Oh, shit!

667
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:30,221
It's okay, Mama. Just
wash it off. It'll be fine.

668
01:12:30,263 --> 01:12:32,182
Don't step on the fingers.

669
01:12:32,182 --> 01:12:36,186
What the hell are they
doing on the floor, anyway?

670
01:12:36,227 --> 01:12:40,023
Good thing you keep a clean house.

671
01:12:40,023 --> 01:12:42,025
I wonder whose tongue this is.

672
01:12:42,025 --> 01:12:45,278
That's that fuckin' biker.

673
01:13:37,664 --> 01:13:41,293
Why are you doing this?

674
01:13:41,334 --> 01:13:45,922
No talking until after
I've said grace, asshole.

675
01:13:57,892 --> 01:14:00,312
Now...

676
01:14:00,353 --> 01:14:04,691
Let's give thanks for the
bounty that's been given us.

677
01:14:04,691 --> 01:14:07,569
Bow your heads.

678
01:14:09,112 --> 01:14:11,489
I was hungry and He gave me meat.

679
01:14:11,531 --> 01:14:14,034
I was thirsty and He gave me drink.

680
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:17,412
I was a stranger and He took me in.

681
01:14:19,164 --> 01:14:23,293
This family has endured
through adversity and pain.

682
01:14:23,376 --> 01:14:27,255
We have endured. Dean.

683
01:14:27,297 --> 01:14:29,716
We have prevailed.

684
01:14:29,758 --> 01:14:32,427
We will never ever go hungry again.

685
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:36,264
Amen.

686
01:14:38,725 --> 01:14:40,602
I have a question for you.

687
01:14:44,189 --> 01:14:46,107
One that involves the
family tree, the...

688
01:14:46,149 --> 01:14:49,361
Lineage, if you will,

689
01:14:49,361 --> 01:14:51,613
So I guess this one's for the table.

690
01:14:53,240 --> 01:14:55,158
You guys fuck all your cousins

691
01:14:55,200 --> 01:14:56,660
Or just the ones you find attractive?

692
01:15:00,205 --> 01:15:01,790
You blasphemous bitch!

693
01:15:01,831 --> 01:15:06,253
This is redemption,
lady! That's what this is!

694
01:15:06,294 --> 01:15:09,256
Oh, you're all gonna pay
for your sins. That's right!

695
01:15:09,297 --> 01:15:11,258
And especially you!

696
01:15:11,299 --> 01:15:15,303
Mama... go take care of Uncle Monty.

697
01:15:20,267 --> 01:15:21,768
You know what, Mama?

698
01:15:21,810 --> 01:15:24,104
I don't think this
one likes your cooking.

699
01:15:24,145 --> 01:15:26,690
But who gives a shit?

700
01:15:26,773 --> 01:15:29,734
She's gonna be sucking
her soup through a straw

701
01:15:29,734 --> 01:15:32,153
For some time to come now, ain't she?

702
01:15:32,195 --> 01:15:35,323
Come on, Monty, take a sip.

703
01:15:35,365 --> 01:15:39,327
You gotta have something
to build up your strength.

704
01:15:41,746 --> 01:15:43,290
Please do it.

705
01:15:43,331 --> 01:15:46,960
Just do whatever you're gonna
do, you bunch of degenerates!

706
01:15:47,002 --> 01:15:50,589
I will not have you
speak ill of this family.

707
01:15:57,946 --> 01:15:59,656
Come on, now, open your mouth.

708
01:16:02,034 --> 01:16:05,495
No. No. No.

709
01:16:21,053 --> 01:16:22,638
Set her free, child.

710
01:16:25,724 --> 01:16:28,852
No! No!

711
01:16:30,229 --> 01:16:33,524
No! No! No! No!

712
01:16:33,565 --> 01:16:35,817
No! No!

713
01:16:37,420 --> 01:16:39,756
Take that one downstairs!

714
01:16:39,797 --> 01:16:42,300
No, you stay away from
me, you fucking animal!

715
01:16:42,342 --> 01:16:44,886
You get the fuck away from me! No!

716
01:16:44,969 --> 01:16:46,804
Get your hands off me!

717
01:16:46,846 --> 01:16:48,806
You dirty animal!

718
01:16:48,848 --> 01:16:51,225
No! Dean! Dean!

719
01:16:51,267 --> 01:16:54,312
Can't you see? Your friend
ain't with us no more.

720
01:16:54,354 --> 01:16:58,191
No! No! No!

721
01:17:02,612 --> 01:17:06,574
Here we go.

722
01:17:06,616 --> 01:17:10,078
Dean! Help! No!

723
01:17:10,119 --> 01:17:12,413
No!

724
01:17:24,008 --> 01:17:25,259
Hey!

725
01:17:26,302 --> 01:17:28,221
Where in the hell you going, bitch?

726
01:17:36,646 --> 01:17:38,856
She's gonna tell them all what we done.

727
01:17:53,955 --> 01:17:57,166
There comes a time when
every boy becomes a man.

728
01:18:25,194 --> 01:18:28,197
You motherfucker!

729
01:18:28,197 --> 01:18:31,451
Now we'll see what kind of
soldier you are, Sheriff.

730
01:18:34,370 --> 01:18:35,997
One!

731
01:18:36,039 --> 01:18:39,375
That was beautiful form, Sheriff!

732
01:18:39,417 --> 01:18:42,545
Two! Halfway doesn't count, dickhead!

733
01:18:42,629 --> 01:18:46,716
Three! Is that all you got?
Is that all you fucking got?

734
01:18:46,758 --> 01:18:49,052
Fucker! You killed my girlfriend!

735
01:18:49,093 --> 01:18:50,887
You fucking asshole!

736
01:18:50,928 --> 01:18:52,764
Fuck you!

737
01:18:56,476 --> 01:18:58,686
My money says you're not going anywhere.

738
01:20:00,915 --> 01:20:02,750
Fuck.

739
01:21:25,166 --> 01:21:26,459
Fuck.

740
01:21:56,489 --> 01:21:58,491
Chrissie!

741
01:25:12,165 --> 01:25:14,876
From 1969 to 1973

742
01:25:14,918 --> 01:25:19,005
The Hewitt family murdered 33
people across the state of Texas.

743
01:25:19,047 --> 01:25:23,176
To this day their killing
spree is universally considered

744
01:25:23,218 --> 01:25:26,846
One of the most notorious
and perversely sadistic crimes

745
01:25:26,888 --> 01:25:29,474
In the annals of American history:

746
01:25:29,516 --> 01:25:31,935
The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.
