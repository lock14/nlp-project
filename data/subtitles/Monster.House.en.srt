1
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:07,207
Hello, fence.

2
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,691
Hello, leaves.

3
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,328
Hello, sky.

4
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,763
Get off my lawn!

5
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,642
Trespasser.

6
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,962
Do you want to be eaten alive?

7
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,881
- No.
- Then get out of here!

8
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,810
My trike.

9
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,684
Stay away from my house!

10
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,044
- DJ!
- We're gonna be late.

11
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,123
Yeah, Mom, I'm coming.
I'm coming.

12
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:25,086
October 30th: another tricycle.

13
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,009
I'm coming.

14
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,365
Mom.

15
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,649
Mom, he did it again.
He took another tricycle.

16
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,121
Okay, honey,
we've talked about this.

17
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,886
You cannot stay up
in your room all day...

18
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:44,361
staring at an old man
through a telescope.

19
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,727
But, Mom, there's something wrong
with that house.

20
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,166
I'm serious.

21
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,209
What was that?

22
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,565
I'm serious.

23
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,168
His voice sounds funny.

24
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,766
Someone is hitting puberty.

25
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:02,083
"What's happening to my body?"
Right, buddy?

26
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:03,805
Maybe you should come with us.

27
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:06,964
Oh, the boy's too busy.
He's got his spying to do.

28
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:09,208
I'm not spying-

29
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,925
Well...

30
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,249
"Well..." That's okay, buddy.

31
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,641
When I was your age,
I did exactly the same thing.

32
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,407
Of course, it was with binoculars
and involved the lovely Jensen twins.

33
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,609
Neither of which was as lovely
as your beautiful mother.

34
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,246
Will you be an angel
and help me bring out the incisor?

35
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:27,686
- The incisor.
- Hold this.

36
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,081
Yeah, you don't wanna forget that.

37
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,922
Elizabeth will be here
in a few hours.

38
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,401
If anything happens,
call the police and hide.

39
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,050
He knows that.

40
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,646
See you tomorrow night.

41
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,804
- What have you done?
- Just let me drive this thing, will you?

42
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,610
- Where is DJ? Where's DJ?
- I'm fine.

43
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,526
You would be so happy
if he was under the car, wouldn't you?

44
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,969
Sorry. It's hard to see
with the mask on.

45
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,600
Then why don't you keep it off,
Chowder?

46
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,649
Why did you put up your window?

47
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,604
- Chowder.
- It's aerodynamic.

48
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,450
- Hi, DJ.
- We've got to make time.

49
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,965
The children. The children.

50
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,929
- What children?
- Bye-bye, baby.

51
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,447
- Tell him you love him, dear.
- He knows that.

52
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:17,166
- Tell your son you love him.
- I don't wanna tell him.

53
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,970
- He knows I love him.
- He's your son.

54
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,363
- You have to say it. Roll it down.
- We're gonna be late.

55
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,724
We both love you.

56
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,326
- That includes your dad.
- That's right.

57
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:31,523
- He's had enough kisses.
- Blow him a kiss.

58
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,569
- Blow him a kiss.
- Goodbye.

59
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,246
Cheer up.
It's almost Halloween.

60
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,563
In one day and three hours,
it's candy time.

61
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,125
Okay?

62
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,369
- Check it out, I got a new ball.
- Cool.

63
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:54,601
Oh, speaking of which,
have you decided?

64
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:58,162
Skullzor or Crypt Keeper?

65
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,845
Chowder.

66
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:05,046
I don't think I'm going
trick-or-treating this year.

67
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,645
What?

68
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,326
Come on, you're gonna break
a six-year streak.

69
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:12,211
Yeah, six years of being jumped
and egged.

70
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,842
Maybe I'm getting too grown-up.

71
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:26,523
Three seconds on the clock.

72
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,569
I'm playing basketball.

73
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:36,048
It's time
for an in-your-face disgrace.

74
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:42,240
- Are you okay?
- My nose is in my brains.

75
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,204
Let me see. Oh, my God.

76
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,880
- What?
- You're a dork.

77
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:49,120
Where's my ball?

78
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,645
Oh, no.

79
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:16,081
- Sorry, man.
- Wait, wait. DJ.

80
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,607
You're a grownup now,
you go get it.

81
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,969
Chowder, your ball just landed
on Nebbercracker's lawn.

82
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,521
It doesn't exist anymore.

83
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,084
I paid $28 for that ball.

84
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,644
I raked 10 yards and asked my mom
for a dollar 26 times.

85
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,851
I never worked that hard in my life...

86
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,408
Nebbercracker hasn't come out yet.

87
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,162
- So?
- So maybe he's sleeping.

88
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:50,964
All right, I'll do it.

89
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,125
I'll never forget this. Hurry, though.

90
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,885
Go.

91
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,487
You.

92
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,404
- No.
- DJ, run!

93
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,809
Get the ball and run!

94
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,448
You're so close.

95
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,170
What have you done?

96
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,163
- Just nudge it over here.
- I'm so sorry.

97
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:28,926
Oh, I'm so, so, so sorry.
I didn't mean...

98
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,650
You are dead.

99
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,729
DJ, come on, come on!

100
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,970
- Chowder.
- Come on, DJ.

101
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,849
Help. Chowder.

102
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,764
Help. Help.

103
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:44,686
- You think you can terrorize my lawn?
- No, I'm sorry.

104
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:47,002
- You wanna be a dead person?
- No. I love life.

105
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,209
This place is not
a playground for children.

106
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:53,290
- Got it from now on.
- This is my house!

107
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,169
Why can't you respect that?

108
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,046
Why can't you
just stay away from...?

109
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,684
Push.

110
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,127
No siren. Never a good sign.

111
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,645
I'm a murderer.

112
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:07,446
- No, you're not.
- I'm not?

113
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,570
When it's an accident,
they call it manslaughter.

114
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,281
I think I'm gonna throw up.

115
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,209
Great. Babysitter's here.

116
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,647
See you, DJ.

117
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,003
Perfect.

118
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,240
DJ.

119
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:32,405
Hey, DJ, I just saw an ambulance.
Did I miss anything interesting?

120
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,280
Hey-

121
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,804
Hello?

122
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,531
Elizabeth...

123
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,964
can I talk to you
about something?

124
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:45,169
Oh, yeah, of course you can,
cantaloupe.

125
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,164
We are gonna have
the bestest time.

126
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,642
- Got tons of neat activities planned.
- They already left.

127
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,485
- They did? They're gone?
- Yes, and I need to talk to you.

128
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:57,530
So the usual deal: indoors by 9,
in your room by 11.

129
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,364
- Lights out, your call.
- Elizabeth.

130
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,887
- And it's Zee.
- "Zee"?

131
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,726
Now, listen up. I control the TV,
the stereo and the phone.

132
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:09,168
I don't do board games,
Shrinky Dinks or tuck-ins.

133
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,561
I'm not your mother.
I'm not your friend.

134
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,884
Don't talk to me like I'm a baby, okay?
I am practically a grownup.

135
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:18,725
I don't even need you here,
Elizabeth.

136
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:31,167
- Gosh, DJ, Why'd you break that?
- But I didn't.

137
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,085
Yeah, let me ask you something.
Who are they gonna believe?

138
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:36,208
- Go to your room.
- Fine.

139
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,569
Hello?

140
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,730
Hello?

141
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,370
Hello?

142
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:40,205
Yeah, very funny.
See how you like it.

143
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,411
Happy Halloween, doofus.

144
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,890
Nice one, Bones.

145
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:25,560
Look at his face. That's funny.

146
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,728
You're not supposed
to have friends over. Who's this?

147
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,331
- This is Bones.
- What's up?

148
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,084
- He's in a band.
- That's right.

149
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:37,404
And, anyway, cantaloupe,
let's not open up the rulebook, okay?

150
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,001
Since you're up
way past your bedtime.

151
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,084
No, no, no, this is different. Listen.

152
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:54,563
You called the neighbours.
Good for you.

153
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,449
I used star-69. He called me.

154
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,364
- Who called you?
- Nebbercracker.

155
00:16:58,760 --> 00:17:00,922
P.S., he died today.

156
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,451
- You lie.
- Do not.

157
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,331
He died, and now I'm getting
phone calls from his house.

158
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:09,963
A phone call
from beyond the grave.

159
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:17,882
Guys, come on. I'm serious.

160
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,088
Oh, he's serious.
Did you know he was serious?

161
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,484
- Come on, man, give her back.
- Oh, "her"? You mind?

162
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,563
Oh, come on. Gross.

163
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:29,485
- Come on, Bones.
- Wait, hold on, dude. I th...

164
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,803
She's having trouble breathing.
Might have something in her throat.

165
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,325
All right, I'll look into it.

166
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,767
- No. Elizabeth. No.
- Okay, Bones, knock it off.

167
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:39,764
Downstairs, now.

168
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:43,443
Sorry, kid, can't play anymore.

169
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,601
You are so funny.

170
00:17:47,760 --> 00:17:50,730
I know. It's like I don't even try
and it just happens.

171
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,846
God, stop doing this.

172
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:21,806
Oh, yeah? What you gonna do?

173
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,683
- Homicide.
- Chowder, where are your parents?

174
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,205
<i>My dad's at the pharmacy...</i>

175
00:18:28,360 --> 00:18:30,931
<i>and my mom's at the movies
with her personal trainer.</i>

176
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:34,482
- Meet me at the Danger Zone now.
- Fine.

177
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:40,725
- Bones, I said, knock it off.
- Come on, man.

178
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,121
No, I'm creeped out.

179
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,886
You know,
I saw an ambulance here today.

180
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,087
So?

181
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,211
So maybe Nebbercracker
really did die.

182
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,643
We should be so lucky.
The guy is evil.

183
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:58,246
No, he's just a crotchety old dude.

184
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:01,290
Oh, really, Zee?

185
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:07,363
When I was 1O years old,
I had a kite. Awesome kite.

186
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:11,047
I could fly it so high
you couldn't see it.

187
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,727
One day, it crashed down.

188
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:19,926
I followed the string
and it ended right over there...

189
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,686
across the street,
right at the edge of his lawn.

190
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,764
Did he take your kite?

191
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:35,242
Yeah, he takes whatever lands
on his lawn.

192
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,442
But that's not the point.

193
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,288
The point is, is that I saw him
talking to his house...

194
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:45,603
and kissing it.

195
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,251
Besides...

196
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,648
everybody knows
what he did to his wife.

197
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:53,280
Why? What...?
What did he do to her?

198
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:58,208
- He ate her.
- Bones. Get off. Stop it!

199
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,647
- Bones, enough.
- Come on, Zee.

200
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,683
Bones, I'm so sick of you.

201
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:06,446
- I was just...
- You have no respect for women.

202
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,210
What? What does that mean?

203
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,725
Get out.

204
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:12,006
Fine.

205
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,211
Prude.

206
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:27,887
What are you looking at?

207
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,846
<i>Nebbercracker.</i>

208
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,921
You really are dead, aren't you?

209
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,644
I'm on your lawn, Nebbercracker.

210
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,687
What are you gonna
do about it, Nebbercracker?

211
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:11,891
Nebber-snapper-flipper-dipper...

212
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,002
My awesome kite.

213
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,046
Chowder.

214
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,001
Chowder.

215
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:39,170
Chowder?

216
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,770
Chowder.

217
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,281
Heat seeker.

218
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:56,408
Chowder, what are you doing?

219
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,967
Shut up.

220
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,247
What?

221
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:02,847
Nebbercracker's back
from the dead.

222
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:05,844
- No way.
- Yeah.

223
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,641
They leave the keys in here.
You dare me?

224
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:12,485
Chowder,
you're not listening to me.

225
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,803
Nebbercracker's haunting me,
all right? His blood is on my hands.

226
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:18,731
And now he's
coming back for revenge.

227
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:21,645
You're really crazy right now.
Have you noticed that?

228
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:25,682
I think you're just freaking out
because you killed a guy today.

229
00:23:25,880 --> 00:23:27,848
Life goes on.

230
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,328
For you.

231
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,166
Try and relax. Be cool, like me.

232
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,328
Chowder, what are you doing?

233
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,806
Make it stop.

234
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,286
Quit screwing around.

235
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,523
I need your help.

236
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,920
Fine.

237
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,725
You want my help?

238
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,451
- Yeah.
- I got three words for you:

239
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:54,207
"Trick or treat."

240
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:59,609
Okay. Whatever. Let's go.

241
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:05,284
Hold on.

242
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,204
Chowder, come on.

243
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:20,562
The haunting is subtle...

244
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:22,525
yet really, really boring.

245
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:24,682
- Can I go home now?
- Chowder, he'll hear you.

246
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,251
DJ...

247
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,046
this is why nobody
will sit next to us at lunch.

248
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:35,040
I'll go Ding Dong Ditch the house
and you'll see. No ghost.

249
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,924
Chowder, stop, please.

250
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:38,201
Chowder, I'm serious.

251
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:41,121
Chowder, come back.
Come back here, please, Chowder.

252
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:42,805
Come on.

253
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:52,401
Chowder. Come back.

254
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:01,680
- Oh, no. A bottle.
- Chowder, put that down.

255
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,366
- Come back, please.
- Bottle.

256
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:25,609
Hey, DJ, who am I?

257
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:28,247
Get off my lawn.

258
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:29,971
Don't. Come on.

259
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,321
Run. Chowder, get out of there.

260
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,005
- Chowder, come here.
- Mommy.

261
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,321
This way. This way.

262
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,641
Help.

263
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,127
Come on, Chowder!
Chowder, this way!

264
00:26:23,920 --> 00:26:25,684
Don't look back.

265
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,928
I looked back.

266
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,929
Bones?

267
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:47,645
Coming.

268
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:52,287
Don't even think
about crawling back here...

269
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,322
Trick or treat.

270
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,721
What?

271
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:07,201
Good morning, ma'am.

272
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:10,045
You witnessed a simulation
of what you'll face this evening.

273
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:12,965
Studies show that households
that run out of candy...

274
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,169
are 55 percent more likely
to be TP'd.

275
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:17,964
To help avert this tragedy...

276
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,488
I'm here selling Halloween candy
for my school, Westbrook Prep.

277
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,087
Good school.
I got kicked out of there.

278
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,402
Now, what do you want?

279
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:31,650
Just trying to get a head start on life
and secure a successful future.

280
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,446
You want a successful future?

281
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:37,126
When a guy with tattoos
comes up to the drive-through...

282
00:27:37,280 --> 00:27:41,046
give him his burger,
not your phone number.

283
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,204
Thank you for the advice.
I'll be sure to make a note of it.

284
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:49,366
But back to business.
Eggs, shaving cream, toilet paper.

285
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:53,765
Without candy, I'm afraid your house
is a bull's-eye with shingles.

286
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:57,367
Nice try. It's not my house.

287
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,601
Babysitter?

288
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,450
Okay, let's cut the crap.

289
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:05,924
Maybe the parents you work for
left you $40 in emergency money.

290
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:08,122
Maybe they left me 30.

291
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:13,003
Maybe you give me 20, I write
a receipt for 3O and you pocket 10.

292
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:14,207
Maybe.

293
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:18,524
And I want two extra bags
of peanut clusters.

294
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:22,605
One bag and I'll
toss in a liquorice whip.

295
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,727
You're good.

296
00:28:36,360 --> 00:28:39,011
Eight a.m. No detectable movement.

297
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,924
No detectable movement.

298
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:44,849
Hey, DJ, I brought you
some chocolate.

299
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,405
Cover blown?

300
00:28:57,080 --> 00:28:58,764
No detectable movement.

301
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,122
What are you two weirdoes up to?

302
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,611
Oh, nothing.

303
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,804
Just something in the house
across the street just tried to eat us.

304
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:09,487
Yeah. We've been watching all night.
We haven't even left this room once.

305
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,331
Not even to go to the bathroom.
Don't drink that.

306
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,887
Oh, gross.

307
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,168
Whatever disease you guys have...

308
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:20,449
I'm sure it's got letters
and that they make pills for it.

309
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,321
Zee, it's true. There's something evil
going on across the street.

310
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,847
That's excellent.
I'm really happy for you.

311
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:32,291
Anyway, have you two astronomers
seen Bones?

312
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,966
He left last night unexpectedly...

313
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,522
and he never came back.

314
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:40,011
Never came back?

315
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:44,651
- Bottle.
- Of course.

316
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,049
Oh, okay, you know what?
I don't have time for this.

317
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,885
Listen, Zee, I don't know
how to tell you this...

318
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,520
Your boyfriend has most likely
been eaten alive.

319
00:29:55,040 --> 00:29:57,486
Sherry Klausen.

320
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:58,881
I gotta go.

321
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,280
Breakfast.

322
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,801
Happy Halloween, losers.

323
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,924
Hello.

324
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,161
What?

325
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,767
What is it?

326
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,206
Oh, nothing.

327
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:33,885
Let me see.

328
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,528
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

329
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:58,365
- No. No. Hey.
- Hey, wait. Hey.

330
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,602
DJ, that's your phone.

331
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:02,888
- No, stop.
- Girl. Hey.

332
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,963
- Don't go in there.
- Hold it.

333
00:31:06,280 --> 00:31:07,406
Don't go any further.

334
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,047
- Come here.
- Yes, over here.

335
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:14,251
Are you guys mentally challenged?

336
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:17,961
If you are,
I'm certified to teach you baseball.

337
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,888
Detectable movement.

338
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,251
- What do we do? What do we do?
- Come on.

339
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,645
Guys.

340
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,329
- Run, Chowder.
- I'm running.

341
00:31:41,800 --> 00:31:43,643
Help, please.

342
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,490
- Got her.
- No, I got her.

343
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:51,289
Hello?

344
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,848
- Hey.
- Oh, my God.

345
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,528
There's an angry dad on the phone
looking for the one called Chowder.

346
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,887
Hello?

347
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,845
Losers, I'm talking to you.

348
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:15,529
He's worried about you.

349
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,523
He should be.

350
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:21,567
- Start explaining.
- All right, the house, it tried to eat us.

351
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,883
- Stop explaining, I've had enough.
- Wait, wait, where are you going?

352
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,646
To see what's happening
with that stupid house of yours.

353
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:30,446
- No, no, no. You can't.
- What is your problem?

354
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:35,328
Puberty. Yeah, I'm having
lots and lots of puberty.

355
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,887
- No more Mountain Dew.
- Right.

356
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,166
I'm going to find Bones.

357
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:45,051
All right, you have fun.
Don't worry about us, we'll be fine.

358
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,329
And you tell him I said hey, okay?
Safe driving.

359
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,284
See you.

360
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:54,881
Oh, hi.

361
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,883
You wanna tell me what's going on?

362
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:59,361
Oh, yeah. I made
the whole puberty thing up.

363
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:03,565
Hi, I'm JD. DJ.

364
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:09,247
Yes, Dad, I meant to call you,
but I forgot.

365
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:12,131
Okay, I'm sorry.

366
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,248
Okay.

367
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,243
Absolutely.

368
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:17,845
Affirmative.

369
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,411
- Okay, love you. Bye.
- Yeah.

370
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,606
And this is
our little observation post...

371
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:27,561
such as it were.

372
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,724
Yeah, posters are stupid.

373
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,406
I was gonna tear them down
and put up some art.

374
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:35,723
Well, Dad, why don't you
kiss my hairy butt?

375
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:38,121
Hey, DJ, you got any beer?

376
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,130
Well, hello there.

377
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,486
This is Chowder.

378
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:42,926
Charles, to the ladies.

379
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,610
Jenny Bennett.

380
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,967
Two-term class president
at Westbrook Prep.

381
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,647
- That's a tough school to get into.
- Yeah, I got in, but decided not to go.

382
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,487
It's a girls' school.

383
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,285
Which is why I didn't.

384
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:02,123
You know, there's a...
There's a great taco stand near there.

385
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,281
I hate Mexican food.

386
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,965
- Me too.
- Me too.

387
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:12,967
Fascinating, isn't it?

388
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:15,646
Just sits there waiting...

389
00:34:16,720 --> 00:34:19,326
mocking us with its...

390
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,125
."houseness.

391
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:24,408
- May I please use your phone?
- Yeah, sure.

392
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:25,641
Here. Who you calling?

393
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,006
- My mother.
- Rude.

394
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,730
She's probably
not gonna believe you.

395
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:31,002
It's too much for the adult mind
to comprehend.

396
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:37,488
Is this pee? Because if it is,
that's really gross.

397
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,281
- It's...
- DJ?

398
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,329
You pee in bottles?

399
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,687
What are you talking about?
That one's your pee.

400
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,841
- It's yours.
- It's his.

401
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,764
- May I speak with Allison?
- Unsanitary.

402
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,843
- Her daughter. Thank you.
- It's his pee.

403
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:51,126
Excuse me.

404
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:56,002
I was selling chocolates in Mayville,
and, well, it's kind of confusing.

405
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:01,363
So you hate Mexican food, huh?

406
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,885
Yeah. You too, huh?

407
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:06,449
Yeah, in fact, you might say
I started hating it first.

408
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,365
Outside in front of the house?

409
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:12,570
- Fine. Let's get technical.
- Okay.

410
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:14,688
I started hating it
through the telescope.

411
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,928
Can't call dibs on a girl
through a telescope.

412
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:18,605
You can't call dibs on a girl.

413
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,370
- Just did.
- Me too.

414
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:21,806
She didn't believe me.

415
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:24,611
Authority can be so:

416
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,521
Okay. Normally I don't spend time
with guys like you.

417
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,408
But a house just tried to eat me,
so you've got one hour.

418
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,051
Oh, a PUPPY-

419
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,049
Didn't see that coming.

420
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,244
QKaY... '

421
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:01,127
I think it's time to call the police.

422
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,805
Do you realise
what's gonna happen tonight?

423
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:14,884
Hundreds of kids
walking right up to that house.

424
00:36:15,040 --> 00:36:18,044
Wait, wait, wait. Come on.
Guys, I think we're overreacting.

425
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:19,281
Think about it.

426
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,729
Only a total moron would walk
up to old man Nebbercracker's house.

427
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,407
- Hey, my ball.
- Chowder.

428
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:31,766
No.

429
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:40,968
It's gonna be a bloodbath.

430
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,049
Good news. The cops are here.

431
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,524
All right, kids, this better be good.

432
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:51,406
I was in the forest wrestling
with a bear claw when we got the call.

433
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:57,290
I was eating a doughnut.

434
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,089
All three of you,
step to the car now.

435
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,930
- My ears.
- They're at the car.

436
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,765
He's a rookie.
First week on the job.

437
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,524
Officer, we have reason
to believe...

438
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,887
there's a dangerous creature
inside that house.

439
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,003
- It may have killed a man.
- And a dog.

440
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:14,766
Doggy down?
We've got a situation.

441
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,486
- We've got a situation.
- What are you doing?

442
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,642
Calling for backup.
Didn't you hear the kid?

443
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:21,888
There's a dangerous creature
inside that house.

444
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,886
We don't have backup.
It's just Judy at the station.

445
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,321
And this is no situation.

446
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:30,563
It's just a couple Tater Tots
hopped up on too many Pixy Stix.

447
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,802
I bet you the dead dog
would beg to differ.

448
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:34,371
What was that?

449
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:35,925
Nothing.

450
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:38,525
All right. Time's up, peewees.

451
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:41,968
- It's Halloween. We got things to do.
- We do?

452
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:45,761
No, wait, you can't.
All right, this thing, it has a mouth...

453
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:49,288
and it comes out and grabs things
and pulls them in and eats them.

454
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,521
Yeah, like this:

455
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:55,004
Okay, okay, okay. The thing is...

456
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:58,960
we're trying to make this sound
more real than it normally would.

457
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,846
Problem is it sounds kind of not real.

458
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,207
- So we'll see you later.
- No.

459
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:08,490
All right. I'll show you.
But if things get out of hand...

460
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,523
We'll aim for Bigfoot.

461
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,731
That's loaded.

462
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,525
He's hopping-

463
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:30,485
Smart house.

464
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:33,881
Hey-

465
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:37,004
You... Both of you. Come here.

466
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:38,400
Bring it to the car.

467
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:39,846
Come on.

468
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:43,487
I'm gonna forget you throwing that rock
because that dance was pretty funny.

469
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,086
But next time any of you
mess with this guy's house...

470
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:48,766
all three of you are going
in the hole, you got it?

471
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,684
Now, I'll give you
10 seconds to march.

472
00:38:50,840 --> 00:38:52,251
But we need your help.

473
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,402
It's your job to help us.

474
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,090
- One.
- Come on.

475
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,810
Two.

476
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,166
Three.

477
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,446
<i>Four.</i>

478
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,090
Five.

479
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:03,926
That's tender.

480
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:06,208
My house is right over there.

481
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,161
So much for relying
on the government.

482
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:12,004
Yeah, I know.
I hate the government.

483
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,646
- Dude, we're screwed.
- No, we're not.

484
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,280
We'll go to an expert.

485
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,051
You're looking
at the three-time, tri-state...

486
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:25,602
over-14
"Thou Art Dead" champion.

487
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:29,247
His name is Reginald Skulinski.
But they call him Skull.

488
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:31,402
- Who's "they"?
- Me and DJ.

489
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,450
- Yeah.
- He's the smartest guy on earth.

490
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:36,131
So let's go talk to him.

491
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,886
- Hey, Jenny, Jenny.
- Hey, Jenny, Jenny, hold on. Hold up.

492
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:41,042
Skull is in the game zone right now.

493
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,771
You don't wanna mess with him
when he's in the game zone.

494
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:47,044
Fine, so how long
is he gonna be playing?

495
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:48,964
Die. Die.

496
00:39:50,040 --> 00:39:54,125
Who knows? He once played
for four days straight...

497
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:58,410
on one quarter, a gallon
of chocolate milk and an adult diaper.

498
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,449
The man's a legend.

499
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:03,729
Well, if he's not coming out of
the game zone, then we are going in.

500
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,287
- What? Hey, what are you...?
- What? Jenny, no.

501
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:11,411
It's like you're not gonna...
You're not gonna do it. Like...

502
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,688
You're gonna die. You're gonna die.

503
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:15,001
<i>Watch out.</i>

504
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,481
Did you see that?
I just chopped off your head again.

505
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,604
Your head's rolling. You can't see it,
your eyes are on your head.

506
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:22,603
- Sir?
- What?

507
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,401
I'm busy playing a video game
without even looking at the screen.

508
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:28,205
What?

509
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,368
Old man Nebbercracker's house
is possessed.

510
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,091
I need to know how to destroy it
before it kills people.

511
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:37,365
Calm down. You make me wanna
throw up in some tinfoil and eat it.

512
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:40,171
Oh, you like the steel of my blade?
It's so cold.

513
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:46,526
Possessed house, you say?

514
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:52,640
In my travels to the video store
and comic-book conventions...

515
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,650
I've seen many strange
and wondrous things.

516
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:58,371
And I've heard tell
of man-made structures...

517
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:01,769
becoming possessed
by a human soul...

518
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:05,567
so that the spirit becomes merged
with wood and brick...

519
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:08,883
creating a rare form of monster...

520
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:13,887
<i>"known as Domus mactabilis.</i>

521
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:20,245
The house is Mr. Nebbercracker.

522
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,004
We're its murderous enemies.

523
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,368
Have fun getting killed.

524
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,648
<i>Run, coward.</i>

525
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,085
Look at that blood.

526
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:34,091
So how do we kill it?

527
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,767
You've gotta strike
at the source of life: the heart.

528
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:40,166
But houses don't have hearts.

529
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,970
Yes!

530
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,091
<i>Oh, yeah.</i>

531
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,005
Yeah. You might be right about that.

532
00:41:50,040 --> 00:41:53,931
Sorry, children, but I've got some very
important business to take care of.

533
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,601
I won't be seeing you later.

534
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:07,928
<i>Thou art dead.</i>

535
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,810
So we need to strike at the heart.

536
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:22,646
Yeah, but where are we gonna find
a heart inside a house?

537
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,203
Ever since Nebbercracker died...

538
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:30,045
there's been smoke
coming out of that chimney.

539
00:42:34,600 --> 00:42:37,251
The furnace.
The furnace is the heart.

540
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:41,449
If we wanna put out the fire,
we're gonna have to go inside.

541
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,046
Without getting chewed to pieces.

542
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,083
- Dummy.
- Hey, I was just doodling.

543
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,971
No, Chowder, this is it.
First, we build a dummy.

544
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:53,646
We fill the dummy
with a few gallons of cold medicine.

545
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,366
- Borrow it from your dad's pharmacy.
- Say what?

546
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,569
Feed the dummy to the house, house
eats the medicine, goes to sleep.

547
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,764
- Look at this.
- We get in, douse the fire and get out.

548
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:09,331
- Questions?
- Yes, are you nuts?

549
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,409
I don't wanna steal drugs
from my father...

550
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:14,166
I don't wanna go inside a monster
and I don't wanna die.

551
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:17,284
- I say it's worth a shot.
- Yes, I agree, let's do it.

552
00:43:47,560 --> 00:43:50,689
Hey, but I wanted that one.

553
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:53,127
- You've gotta be kidding me.
- Yes.

554
00:44:22,080 --> 00:44:25,402
- Chowder. Quiet.
- Sorry.

555
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,291
Go.

556
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:44,561
Whoopsie-daisy.

557
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:56,924
All right, little vacuum-cleaner dummy,
I'm gonna move you into position.

558
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,441
You don't be scared.

559
00:45:00,600 --> 00:45:02,489
That's not how I trained you.

560
00:45:02,640 --> 00:45:04,404
I love you, vacuum-cleaner dummy.

561
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:07,410
Chowder, come on.

562
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,085
Okay.

563
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,810
Yes.

564
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,962
Trick or treat.

565
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:34,486
Plug it in.

566
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:20,963
So close.

567
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:29,121
Littering, loitering,
vandalism, vagrancy...

568
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:30,964
- And treason.
- No, not treason.

569
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:33,043
- You sure? Because in the book...
- I'm sure.

570
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,362
All right, kids, out of the trash cans.
Let's go.

571
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:39,485
Come on. You heard the big guy.
You see the light. Walk towards it.

572
00:46:40,400 --> 00:46:41,526
Come on, keep it moving.

573
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:44,524
All right, drop your weapons.

574
00:46:44,680 --> 00:46:47,047
Pass them to me. Come on.

575
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:53,602
- I will shoot you.
- Well, lookie we got here.

576
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,087
You stay here,
I'm checking this out.

577
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:02,889
I am on it.

578
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,767
Y'all think something's funny?
You testing me? Huh, tough girl?

579
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,206
You disrespecting the badge?

580
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:25,768
You don't want none of this.
I'm telling you. Test me. Please.

581
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,082
Y'all wanna test me?

582
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:29,850
I am the police.

583
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,291
I know you're a thug.
Them brown eyes...

584
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:35,601
I see it in your eyes.

585
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:38,286
That's it. That is it.

586
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,920
You got something to say,
Porky, huh?

587
00:47:41,080 --> 00:47:44,368
- That's it, we're taking them in.
- That's what I'm talking about.

588
00:47:44,520 --> 00:47:46,727
- Where we taking them?
- To jail. Let's go.

589
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:50,288
You hear that?
You guys are going to jail.

590
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:52,488
But, officer,
you've gotta believe us.

591
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:54,887
Yeah, 2-percent,
you got the right to shut up.

592
00:47:55,040 --> 00:47:58,442
- Okay, the house is a monster.
- And to think I believed you.

593
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,406
Hey, listen, I'm with you guys.
My cousin's a cop in Milwaukee.

594
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:05,211
I mean, kind of a cop.
He has a gun.

595
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,324
Yeah. They're gonna love you
downtown, Jughead.

596
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,929
We are supercops.

597
00:48:13,080 --> 00:48:15,401
Yeah. That's why I live in a condo.

598
00:48:15,560 --> 00:48:18,166
Supercop. Super-duper-duper-cop.
Super...

599
00:48:19,880 --> 00:48:22,531
- You hear that?
- That's my stomach. I'm starving.

600
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:26,401
No, no. That sounds
like the dangerous creature.

601
00:48:26,560 --> 00:48:29,928
- I'm gonna go check it out.
- Oh, my gosh.

602
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:33,323
This is like trying to wrangle a puppy.
All right, I'll be back.

603
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:34,845
- You guyS, StOP-
'H93', GUYS-

604
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:37,685
- No. Get out of there.
- No, don't go in there.

605
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,205
What?

606
00:48:52,600 --> 00:48:56,127
I tell you. Super-roll.

607
00:48:57,640 --> 00:49:00,291
- Stop. Stop.
- Hey. Hey. Come on.

608
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,329
You don't know
what's up with that house.

609
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,364
Where you at, spooky creature?

610
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,329
I'm gonna find you.

611
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:17,361
Freeze...

612
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,204
tree.

613
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:23,840
Hey, what you doing?
You can't do that.

614
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:27,686
Not to an officer, brother.
That is illegal.

615
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,690
- I'm coming, buddy.
- Put me down!

616
00:49:32,840 --> 00:49:36,401
- I'm gonna go get backup.
- I thought there was no backup.

617
00:49:36,560 --> 00:49:38,050
I'm getting Judy.

618
00:49:40,360 --> 00:49:43,045
Judy!

619
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:45,722
Help!

620
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:47,331
Mama!

621
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,126
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God.

622
00:49:54,280 --> 00:49:57,568
- I think I'm having a stroke.
- Just try to stay calm, okay?

623
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:00,604
We'll be all right
if we just stay calm.

624
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,522
I'm too young to die!

625
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:27,524
Jenny. I've always loved you.

626
00:50:28,600 --> 00:50:30,602
- Chowder!
- Sorry.

627
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,883
Mama!

628
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:35,282
I can't look.

629
00:50:41,600 --> 00:50:44,001
Guys, come on. Let's go.

630
00:51:25,840 --> 00:51:29,731
We're dead. You've killed us
and now we're dead.

631
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:32,884
I don't think the house knows
that we're in here.

632
00:51:33,040 --> 00:51:35,611
I bet it thinks we're still in the car.

633
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,330
Listen.

634
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:39,721
It sounds like it's sleeping.

635
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,646
The only way that we're gonna
get out of here alive...

636
00:51:42,800 --> 00:51:45,406
is if we find the heart,
we put out the fire.

637
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,927
Maybe we should examine
our other options.

638
00:51:48,120 --> 00:51:50,202
Sure. Other option:

639
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:53,682
We wait here and do nothing
until it wakes up and eats us.

640
00:51:54,600 --> 00:51:57,809
Find the heart,
put out the fire. Got it.

641
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,523
Explosives. That's so cool.

642
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,926
- He was watching me.
- DJ.

643
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:36,250
Did you ever see a wife?

644
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,766
People used to say he had one...

645
00:52:40,840 --> 00:52:43,286
but he fattened her up...

646
00:52:43,800 --> 00:52:45,802
and he ate her.

647
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,444
"Demolition squad."

648
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,443
Sorry.

649
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:03,404
Come on.

650
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:08,086
Be quiet.

651
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,005
Don't worry, I have a very light step.

652
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:20,930
There. Right there. Shoot it.

653
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:03,603
What? I thought
if I shot the heart, that...

654
00:54:03,800 --> 00:54:06,007
- That's not the heart.
- Then what is it?

655
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:10,324
Well, if those are the teeth
and that's the tongue...

656
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:12,847
then that must be the uvula.

657
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,168
So it's a girl house.

658
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:20,288
What? No.

659
00:54:20,480 --> 00:54:24,041
It stimulates the gag reflex.
Everyone has a uvula.

660
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,486
Not me.

661
00:54:42,360 --> 00:54:44,010
No.

662
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,005
Okay. Let's move.

663
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:58,726
We need to move quickly
and quietly.

664
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:00,405
Don't touch anything.

665
00:55:00,560 --> 00:55:02,927
And stay together...

666
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:05,003
- DJ!
- Wait.

667
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:06,764
DJ.

668
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:14,162
I'll save you.

669
00:55:27,920 --> 00:55:29,809
Chowder, knock it off.

670
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:33,089
Sorry. I thought you were... DJ!

671
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:35,686
- Chowder, it's a toy.
- Oh, yeah.

672
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,808
Where's DJ?

673
00:55:37,960 --> 00:55:40,884
- DJ.
- Over here.

674
00:55:44,280 --> 00:55:46,886
Look at all these toys.

675
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:51,848
This must be where
Nebbercracker kept his stash.

676
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,449
"Stash."

677
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:58,047
I think you guys
should have a look at this.

678
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:06,449
"Constance, the giantess."

679
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:19,851
- The key.
- Come on, we don't have time for this.

680
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,809
Yeah, we've gotta
find a way out of here.

681
00:56:29,360 --> 00:56:31,408
What are you doing?

682
00:56:40,560 --> 00:56:43,803
We have a Ping-Pong table
in our basement.

683
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:50,920
Constance.

684
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:54,687
Holy moly. He really did eat her.

685
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,604
Couldn't have.

686
00:56:56,760 --> 00:57:00,651
Her whole body is buried in cement.

687
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,362
Look at all this stuff.

688
00:57:11,560 --> 00:57:15,406
Why would he build her a shrine
if he murdered her?

689
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:20,202
Maybe he just felt guilty or something.
DJ, can we please get out of here?

690
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,491
I always knew you were hiding
something, Mr. Nebbercracker.

691
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:32,809
DJ.

692
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,727
Way to go, big nose.

693
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,451
- It's awake.
- Run!

694
00:57:58,800 --> 00:58:00,086
Hide.

695
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:22,929
Hey, I know that sound.

696
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,443
My ball.

697
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:31,604
Where are you going? Come here.

698
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:35,481
- Chowder, come back.
- You get back here.

699
00:58:37,960 --> 00:58:39,246
Gotcha.

700
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,767
Killer Slinkys!

701
00:58:46,280 --> 00:58:49,523
- Chowder.
- Leave me alone!

702
00:58:58,280 --> 00:59:01,807
DJ! Help!

703
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:06,205
Oh, no.

704
00:59:13,560 --> 00:59:14,607
Get off.

705
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,004
Jenny.

706
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:30,601
Chowder.

707
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:36,841
Come on, Chowder, grab on.

708
00:59:38,080 --> 00:59:39,684
Gotcha.

709
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:43,084
DJ, look out!

710
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:49,330
No!

711
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,162
The uvula.

712
01:00:08,840 --> 01:00:11,571
_D_I__
- Chowder.

713
01:00:11,840 --> 01:00:13,763
Mommy!

714
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,804
Gross.

715
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:32,050
Did we just get upchucked?

716
01:00:32,200 --> 01:00:35,488
The uvula, nature's emergency exit.

717
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:43,170
That's it. Another great idea, DJ.
Brilliant.

718
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:44,765
What do you want from me,
Chowder?

719
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:47,321
I don't see you coming up
with any big ideas.

720
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:50,051
Oh, yeah? Yeah?
Do you wanna hear my big idea?

721
01:00:50,200 --> 01:00:54,091
I'm going home to make
a pretzel sandwich. See you.

722
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:57,244
Chowder, the house is still alive
and you're gonna wuss out?

723
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:00,244
I risked my life for you.
I stole drugs for you...

724
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,607
- ...and I could've died in there.
- Yeah, me too.

725
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:05,451
You're the one that killed
Nebbercracker in the first place.

726
01:01:05,640 --> 01:01:07,244
- Getting your ball back.
- You guys.

727
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:10,051
Stop fighting.
You're acting like babies.

728
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,248
We are babies.

729
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:13,890
What were we thinking?

730
01:01:14,040 --> 01:01:16,964
We tried to put a house to sleep
with cold medicine.

731
01:01:17,120 --> 01:01:20,090
- How lame can you get?
- Where are you going?

732
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:23,090
I'm going home. I suck.

733
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,723
DJ.

734
01:01:28,440 --> 01:01:31,284
At least it's an ambulance.

735
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:36,084
DJ?

736
01:01:54,720 --> 01:01:56,768
It's a ghost.

737
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,928
Begone. Fie.

738
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:03,880
Begone yourself. Get away.

739
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,769
He's not a ghost.

740
01:02:06,920 --> 01:02:09,730
He's not dead. I'm not a murderer.

741
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:13,687
Of course I'm not dead.
Who said I was dead?

742
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,483
You'll be dead if you don't scram.

743
01:02:16,640 --> 01:02:18,529
- Come on, DJ.
- Let's hurry.

744
01:02:18,680 --> 01:02:22,162
Don't you know what day this is?

745
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:27,849
I'm running out of time.
I'm running out of time.

746
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,530
Honey...

747
01:02:34,840 --> 01:02:36,410
I'm home.

748
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:42,364
Oh, look at you, dear.

749
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,841
Your shingles are all ruffled...

750
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:49,326
and your windows are cracked.

751
01:02:51,840 --> 01:02:55,731
Oh, but it's no problem, sweetheart.
It's no problem at all.

752
01:02:55,880 --> 01:02:59,043
It's her. The house is her.

753
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:01,009
- DJ, what are you doing?
- Wait. Come on.

754
01:03:01,160 --> 01:03:02,525
- Come back.
- Where you going?

755
01:03:02,680 --> 01:03:04,444
Nothing paint and varnish
can't handle.

756
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:07,001
Mr. Nebbercracker.

757
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:09,885
I know about Constance.

758
01:03:10,040 --> 01:03:11,644
You what?

759
01:03:12,120 --> 01:03:14,566
What do you know?
You don't know anything.

760
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,400
You were in my house? You...

761
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,687
You didn't kill her, did you?

762
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:35,965
I love her so much.

763
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:05,810
Hello?

764
01:04:08,080 --> 01:04:09,923
It's okay.

765
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:13,441
I can take you away from here.

766
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,443
Would you like that?

767
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:20,604
Yes.

768
01:04:22,280 --> 01:04:24,248
There we go.

769
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,243
Won't be long now.

770
01:04:33,560 --> 01:04:35,289
All right.

771
01:04:37,320 --> 01:04:39,368
Okay, open your eyes.

772
01:04:40,960 --> 01:04:44,282
- Now, it's not much, I know, but just...
- Darling.

773
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:52,687
Get away from my house!

774
01:04:52,840 --> 01:04:55,969
I'm gonna rip them to bits.

775
01:04:57,240 --> 01:04:58,890
Help.

776
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:00,570
- Constance.
- Help. Help.

777
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:02,961
- What's wrong? Are you hurt?
- Hurt?

778
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:06,169
Yes, I'm hurt. Those criminals
are attacking our house.

779
01:05:06,320 --> 01:05:07,560
- Trick or treat.
- Now, now...

780
01:05:07,880 --> 01:05:10,804
they're just kids, dear.

781
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:12,166
- It's Halloween.
- No, no, no.

782
01:05:12,320 --> 01:05:14,766
It's my house,
and they're hurting me.

783
01:05:14,920 --> 01:05:18,129
Constance, look at me. Look at me.

784
01:05:18,280 --> 01:05:23,081
As long as I'm here,
I will never let anyone hurt you.

785
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,526
- Constance.
- Sucker.

786
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:26,330
You vandals.

787
01:05:26,520 --> 01:05:28,010
- Eat this.
- You hooligans.

788
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:30,686
- I'll get you.
- Constance, no!

789
01:05:44,760 --> 01:05:48,207
<i>So I finished the house.</i>

790
01:05:48,360 --> 01:05:51,170
<i>She would've wanted that.</i>

791
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:55,885
<i>She died, but she didn't</i> leave.

792
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:01,848
<i>And that night...</i>

793
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:06,688
<i>that one night of every year...</i>

794
01:06:06,840 --> 01:06:09,047
<i>I had to take precautions.</i>

795
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,043
- Trick or treat.
- I had to.

796
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,727
- Sucker.
- I had to.

797
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:20,325
Hey! Get a...

798
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:24,121
Stay away from my house!

799
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:28,083
She attacks anyone
who comes near.

800
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:29,480
Go.

801
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:32,246
I'm coming, dear.

802
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:33,970
Go.

803
01:06:34,600 --> 01:06:37,365
No, no, no, wait. I can't let you
do this, Mr. Nebbercracker.

804
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,091
I know that you've been
protecting us all these years.

805
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,322
But now it's our turn to protect you.

806
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:44,608
Let her go.

807
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:50,923
But if I let her go...

808
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:53,045
then I'll have no one.

809
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:55,564
That's not true.

810
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,404
Constance, no!

811
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:21,046
Come on.

812
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:25,242
The house is alive!

813
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,327
This way. This way. Come on.

814
01:07:35,880 --> 01:07:37,803
You guys, come on.

815
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,401
- What are you doing?
- Trying to slow the house down.

816
01:07:45,560 --> 01:07:47,767
Move it, pork chop.

817
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,810
Come on, come on.

818
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:10,161
Come on, Mr. Nebbercracker.
Come on.

819
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,207
I can't.

820
01:08:16,840 --> 01:08:18,842
Mr. Nebbercracker. Hurry.

821
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,009
Go on. I'll be all right.

822
01:08:22,000 --> 01:08:23,684
Oh, man.

823
01:08:36,480 --> 01:08:39,211
What are you waiting for?
Come on.

824
01:09:03,320 --> 01:09:06,722
You stay away
from those children, Constance!

825
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:33,880
Constance.

826
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:36,844
Mr. Nebbercracker.

827
01:09:39,080 --> 01:09:40,764
Oh, now...

828
01:09:42,280 --> 01:09:44,851
There, there, girl.

829
01:09:46,920 --> 01:09:48,922
My sweet.

830
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:52,566
You've been a bad girl, haven't you?

831
01:09:53,400 --> 01:09:55,641
You've hurt people.

832
01:09:55,960 --> 01:09:58,281
Oh, Constance.

833
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:03,807
Oh, we've always known
this day would come. Haven't we?

834
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:12,330
I have to make things right.

835
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:18,523
I have to make things right.

836
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:23,289
Constance.

837
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:30,161
I've always done
what's best for you, haven't I?

838
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:32,966
Haven't I, girl?

839
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,684
Come on, let's move.

840
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:40,848
Oh, Constance.

841
01:10:44,160 --> 01:10:47,687
Let this be the right thing to do.

842
01:10:54,280 --> 01:10:55,520
Leave him alone!

843
01:10:55,680 --> 01:10:59,082
Yeah, get your grubby branches
off the old man!

844
01:11:00,920 --> 01:11:02,649
Take that!

845
01:11:03,840 --> 01:11:05,842
And that!

846
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,321
Mr. Nebbercracker.

847
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,203
Oh, kid, come here.

848
01:11:15,800 --> 01:11:17,768
- Take this.
- What?

849
01:11:18,360 --> 01:11:20,328
You have to help me. Please.

850
01:11:20,480 --> 01:11:22,767
I know you can do it.

851
01:11:24,960 --> 01:11:28,203
Go on. Go. Hurry.

852
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:31,723
How do you know
how to drive this thing?

853
01:11:31,880 --> 01:11:33,450
I don't.

854
01:11:37,240 --> 01:11:39,971
The chimney.
The chimney leads to the heart.

855
01:11:46,160 --> 01:11:47,685
Jenny!

856
01:11:59,640 --> 01:12:02,246
Jenny. Are you all right?

857
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:04,523
I'm not sure.

858
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,165
DJ, get rid of that thing.

859
01:12:11,320 --> 01:12:13,402
I'm working on it.

860
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:16,484
Chowder, I need you to get the house
down under that crane.

861
01:12:16,760 --> 01:12:18,285
<i>Think you could do that?</i>

862
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:20,442
Piece of cake.

863
01:12:21,760 --> 01:12:23,250
Come on.

864
01:12:29,240 --> 01:12:32,403
You think you can just
mess with my friends?

865
01:12:38,840 --> 01:12:40,649
DJ, look.

866
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:57,603
Mommy.

867
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:04,965
<i>Chowder.</i>

868
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:07,202
<i>Come in, Chowder.</i>

869
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:09,562
<i>Chowder, buddy?</i>

870
01:13:18,280 --> 01:13:19,520
He)', guys.

871
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:23,321
Look who just won.
It's me, the screwup.

872
01:13:23,480 --> 01:13:26,290
Way to go, Chowder, you did it!

873
01:13:26,960 --> 01:13:30,203
Look at me. Look at Chowder.
Oh, yeah.

874
01:13:30,760 --> 01:13:33,001
- Sorry.
- Guys, come on.

875
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:36,560
Yes. Look at me.

876
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,844
You can't do that.

877
01:13:43,000 --> 01:13:45,480
That's not fair.

878
01:14:04,160 --> 01:14:06,845
No. Get on the top. Help!

879
01:14:10,520 --> 01:14:13,046
That's it, Chowder.
Keep her coming.

880
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,641
You ain't nothing. You're a shack.
You're an outhouse.

881
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:29,724
No!

882
01:15:17,560 --> 01:15:20,723
- I can't.
- Yes, you can.

883
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:24,446
Go.

884
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:26,284
I kissed a girl.

885
01:15:26,680 --> 01:15:28,569
I kissed a girl on the lips.

886
01:15:31,480 --> 01:15:35,451
Guys. Any time now.

887
01:15:40,560 --> 01:15:42,289
Sorry.

888
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:46,681
DJ, hurry.

889
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,564
I'm flying!

890
01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:00,086
- On three, light the dynamite.
- Okay, I got it.

891
01:16:04,320 --> 01:16:06,163
- One.
- Come on, come on, come on.

892
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:08,766
- Two.
- Yes.

893
01:16:09,080 --> 01:16:10,650
Thr...

894
01:16:11,480 --> 01:16:13,960
DJ!

895
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:22,002
Three!

896
01:17:20,480 --> 01:17:22,448
Do you guys hear something?

897
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:27,405
It's over there. Come on.

898
01:17:29,600 --> 01:17:31,807
Oh, my dear.

899
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,243
Good bye.

900
01:18:04,840 --> 01:18:09,402
I'm sorry, Mr. Nebbercracker,
about your house...

901
01:18:09,760 --> 01:18:13,162
and your wife.

902
01:18:15,760 --> 01:18:17,205
Your house-wife.

903
01:18:21,080 --> 01:18:24,607
Forty-five years.

904
01:18:25,920 --> 01:18:31,211
We have been trapped
for 45 years.

905
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,169
And now...

906
01:18:36,120 --> 01:18:38,168
we're free.

907
01:18:40,960 --> 01:18:43,327
We're free.

908
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:46,041
Thank you, friend.

909
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:50,440
Thank you all.

910
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:52,928
We're free.

911
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:07,440
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

912
01:19:07,600 --> 01:19:09,523
Happy Halloween.

913
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:13,367
- Trick or treat.
- Trick or treat.

914
01:19:13,840 --> 01:19:14,887
Here you go.

915
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:16,320
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

916
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,564
Happy Halloween.

917
01:19:18,720 --> 01:19:20,324
Next.

918
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:24,522
What happened
to Nebbercracker's house?

919
01:19:26,440 --> 01:19:29,284
It turned into a monster,
so I blew it up.

920
01:19:31,040 --> 01:19:32,804
Trick or treat.

921
01:19:32,960 --> 01:19:34,371
We're gonna need a tricycle.

922
01:19:35,360 --> 01:19:37,840
One tricycle, coming up.

923
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:42,690
Tricycle.

924
01:19:43,160 --> 01:19:45,322
- Tricycle.
- Hello, tricycle.

925
01:19:45,480 --> 01:19:47,369
I missed you so much.

926
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:49,522
- Thank you, mister.
- Goodbye, now.

927
01:19:49,720 --> 01:19:52,291
- Happy Halloween.
- Come on.

928
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,611
- Mom. There's my mom.
- Jenny!

929
01:19:55,760 --> 01:19:57,125
- One second.
- Okay.

930
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:00,528
So...

931
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:02,682
We should hang out again.

932
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:04,126
Soon.

933
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,922
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

934
01:20:08,080 --> 01:20:09,730
See you.

935
01:20:14,240 --> 01:20:16,641
Good luck with the puberty.

936
01:20:17,640 --> 01:20:20,120
She grabbed my butt.

937
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:22,044
That's nice, Chowder.

938
01:20:22,200 --> 01:20:24,680
Hey, Mr. Nebbercracker.
It's time to go.

939
01:20:24,880 --> 01:20:28,930
Oh, you go on.
I've got some work to do.

940
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:32,042
All right. Thanks.

941
01:20:32,200 --> 01:20:34,089
<i>- I'll</i> see you around.
- All right. Bye.

942
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:35,446
Hey-

943
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:38,127
Stay off my lawn.

944
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:41,088
I'm just kidding.

945
01:20:41,240 --> 01:20:44,164
- You think he'll be okay?
- Yeah. He'll be fine.

946
01:20:44,360 --> 01:20:47,762
He'll go on vacation, get some colour,
maybe he'll meet someone new.

947
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:50,161
This time, maybe
a nice beach house.

948
01:20:51,920 --> 01:20:53,206
Hey, DJ, look who's here.

949
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:55,567
- Yes, I can see that, thank you.
- No biggie.

950
01:20:55,720 --> 01:20:57,529
- Hey, boys.
- Hey, Dad.

951
01:21:00,840 --> 01:21:03,650
What the heck kind...?
No, don't tell me. Let me guess.

952
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:06,123
It's...

953
01:21:07,920 --> 01:21:11,720
- Dirty pirates?
- That's it. Dirty pirates.

954
01:21:13,080 --> 01:21:15,731
Fun, fun. Oh, you look adorable.

955
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:18,561
Have fun tonight.

956
01:21:33,040 --> 01:21:36,886
You know, you were right.

957
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:39,971
We're definitely too old
for trick-or-treating.

958
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:43,801
Oh, yeah. No question about it.

959
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:48,524
On the other hand...

960
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:51,888
we've been working all night.

961
01:22:00,680 --> 01:22:02,011
Candy time?

962
01:22:02,640 --> 01:22:03,880
Candy time.

963
01:22:04,040 --> 01:22:06,281
We're back. Yes.

964
01:22:06,480 --> 01:22:08,482
Candy.

965
01:23:45,640 --> 01:23:49,042
- Did we just get...?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

966
01:23:50,360 --> 01:23:52,567
It's Halloween, right?

967
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:57,328
What do you say you and I go out...

968
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:01,246
and "inspect" some candy, huh?

969
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:06,443
We should go eat some candy too.

970
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,086
That's a good idea.

971
01:24:08,240 --> 01:24:12,723
Okay. All right.
Let's go eat some candy.

972
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:15,690
Lots of yummy candy.

973
01:24:15,840 --> 01:24:17,842
<i>Like carrots.</i>

974
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,803
<i>All right, where's the car?</i>

975
01:24:20,960 --> 01:24:23,964
And that is how I slayed
that mystical dragon.

976
01:24:24,160 --> 01:24:27,243
Oh, yeah? That's great.

977
01:24:27,400 --> 01:24:28,925
Come on, baby. We're out of here.

978
01:24:30,360 --> 01:24:32,931
Not so fast, Bones.

979
01:24:33,080 --> 01:24:35,287
Times have changed.

980
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,204
Skull's not like you.

981
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,601
He gives me the respect I deserve...

982
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:41,370
and makes time for me.

983
01:24:42,120 --> 01:24:43,167
Whatever.

984
01:24:45,720 --> 01:24:46,801
<i>Bones!</i>

985
01:29:57,160 --> 01:29:58,810
<i>Hello, fence.</i>

986
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:10,169
<i>Hello, leaves.</i>

987
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,562
<i>Hello, sky.</i>
