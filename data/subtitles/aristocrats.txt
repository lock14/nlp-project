1
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,438
<i>The joke leads me down one path
and then it switches the path on me suddenly,</i>

2
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:15,357
<i>and it hits me with a hammer.</i>

3
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:16,958
It's just, "Here we go, folks."

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,755
You have outstretched yourself when you're
doing it right, on making it as horrific as you can.

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:25,759
- And bam!
- Fan them with as polite a title as you can.

6
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,279
- The Aristocrats.
- The Aristocrats.

7
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:30,073
- The Aristocrats.
- What?

8
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:33,237
I've heard the joke.
But I don't remember what was so bad.

9
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,669
I remember that I... fainted.

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:41,312
That joke's been around.
The Aristocrats is a classic.

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,148
They told it on the Niña or the Pinta or Santa
Maria when Columbus was crossing the ocean.

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,668
I think Lincoln told me, I'm not quite sure.

13
00:00:47,720 --> 00:00:50,632
I was at the theatre at the time, I was an usher.

14
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:53,956
Of all the jokes to do a documentary about,
you chose this one?

15
00:00:56,120 --> 00:00:59,317
<i>There was the Secret Society -
Chevy Chase, Michael O'Donoghue.</i>

16
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,112
<i>John Belushi and some others.</i>

17
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,233
They had this coven of people
who would tell this joke over and over again.

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,397
Chevy Chase supposedly used to have parties.
And the criteria was,

19
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:11,716
you had the mom, the dad, the son,
the daughter, and a dog.

20
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:15,992
And you had to talk with some combination
of that without repeating yourself.

21
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:17,996
If you repeated yourself, you were out.

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,395
The idea was we gotta break a half an hour.

23
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:23,352
We gotta get - we gotta make this joke
last more than half an hour.

24
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,073
I don't know whether they ever did.
O'Donoghue came close.

25
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,076
But died in the attempt.

26
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:29,519
<i>Not well known.</i>

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:32,518
I heard Michael O'Donoghue did it
for 90 minutes once.

28
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,439
<i>It's the only joke I know that people talk about.</i>

29
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,631
I'm always shocked when people
don't know this joke. It's pervasive.

30
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,557
It's a burlesque kind of a joke.

31
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,989
It had been kicked around a lot.

32
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,190
I remember it -
the same you remember any first.

33
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,800
Like the first time
you hear a cut from a Lenny Bruce album.

34
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,432
Shocking! You'd never heard that.

35
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:53,597
I heard it from a gentleman
who ran Second City in Chicago.

36
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,349
...UCLA, working on the humour magazine,
the editor told me the joke.

37
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:01,313
- Bill Hicks - that's where I heard it.
- I first heard the Aristocrats while doing blow

38
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,157
in Catch A Rising Star with Richard Belzer.

39
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,078
This joke is a friend of every comedian
in the world.

40
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,078
<i>I first went to the lmprov nightclub
in New York in '73.</i>

41
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,270
<i>Did some stand-up comedy,
became the manager,</i>

42
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,232
<i>and got to meet
the best young comedians of that time.</i>

43
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,475
<i>Got a real education in the comedy world.</i>

44
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:20,035
One of the things that was consistent
wherever you went was the...

45
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,638
Aristocrats joke.

46
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,319
I had heard about the Aristocrats joke.

47
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,874
We do comedy
and we work places that have comedy,

48
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:31,994
but we're also in the magic world,
so we're kind of observers of the comedy world.

49
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,749
There was always a secret handshake
of... of a whole culture thing,

50
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,997
that was, to me,
symbolised by the joke, the Aristocrats.

51
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,160
I don't think comics should be that proud,
quite frankly,

52
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:46,589
about repeating a joke
that's been going on since

53
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,791
Bud Friedman opened the first Improv
next to the pyramids.

54
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,034
You dig?

55
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,640
Comedians didn't tell this kind of joke on stage.

56
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,238
How many people tell jokes on stage?

57
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,829
People usually have routines
or they string together small observations.

58
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,237
You don't do joke-jokes on stage ever.
That's a kiss of death. You're viewed as a hack.

59
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,794
You know the way those urban legends go?

60
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,594
People always knew somebody
who saw this guy doing it.

61
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,756
But I never saw anyone performing it.

62
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,030
It's a kind of joke you love telling other comics.

63
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,310
We told them to each other.
Not to do with our act.

64
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:19,477
It was the kind of thing that you would share
with the musicians.

65
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,796
It just remained in the business, swirling round.

66
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,914
- Funnier stuff happened after the audience left.
- We're different. We're in here. There's no rules.

67
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:31,794
Headmaster's home, we had the
dormitory to ourselves. "Wait till you hear this."

68
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,391
I have a recollection of the joke being told
at about five o'clock in the morning

69
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:37,919
for a bunch of comedians.

70
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,837
You always saved it - like a powerhouse.

71
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,871
It was one of those toppers you could pull out.

72
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,629
There was almost like a chorus of the punch
line. "And what's it called?"

73
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,672
But the jokes that we loved telling,
and the jokes I always loved,

74
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,712
were jokes that have this body of performance
in the middle.

75
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,275
It's a show-offy, kind of an inside thing
for performing comics.

76
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:58,790
Garry Shandling told it to me as the way I told it,
word for word,

77
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,149
at the Emo, which is like playing
the telephone game.

78
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,877
There's the basic framework, but then every
comedian puts his own imprimatur on the joke.

79
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,478
And really makes it their own.

80
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,830
I don't know the standard telling of this joke
any more, it's lost.

81
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,075
Well, it's a vaudeville agent.

82
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:17,157
Jay Marshall is the definitive joke-teller on that,

83
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,031
even though he's not known as a comedian,

84
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,071
because he is from the variety arts.

85
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:26,433
<i>Jay Marshall turns out to be the one who tells
the Aristocrats joke for the Legman book.</i>

86
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,038
It's the last story in the book.

87
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,389
He gets the whole thing across
in a few sentences.

88
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,956
A vaudeville agent is interviewing acts,
and an act comes in.

89
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,513
He says, "What do you do?"

90
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:41,350
"Well, my wife and I come out and take
our clothes off and we shit on the stage

91
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,709
and the kids come out and wallow in it."

92
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:46,149
He says, "What kind of an act do you call that?"

93
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:49,715
He says, "We call it the Aristocrats."

94
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:55,437
The joke sucks. You suck for having the idea
of putting this on a documentary.

95
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,909
I hate the joke.

96
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:01,351
A piece of shit stolen... pretend to be humour.

97
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,709
Although the premise is funny.
Let me just...

98
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:06,876
Let me backtrack just a bit.

99
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,831
Well, it's a perfectly crafted joke.

100
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,074
A two-word punch line.

101
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:13,556
And since the middle is open
you can do anything with it.

102
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,673
It's like a jazz theme. There's the basic melody
but anybody can improvise on it.

103
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,316
And I cannot remember for the life of me,
what the details of the act were.

104
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,875
I just knew as I was hearing it
you could do what you want with it.

105
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,708
As long as you got to the,
"What do you call the act?" "The Aristocrats."

106
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,318
You just wanna shock the people

107
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,035
so when you come back, the juxtaposition
of their name becomes the laugh.

108
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,593
It's filled with vulgarity.

109
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,870
Not kind of vulgar, it's... it's revolting.

110
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,070
It's disgusting, and then the punch line.

111
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,998
And then the punch line is sort of uplifting.

112
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:47,191
The more vulgar it is,
the more ironic becomes the punch line.

113
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:49,196
The more grotesqueries, the better of it.

114
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,834
That's the craft,
the art is how you make that turn.

115
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:54,792
That's the thing you can't bottle.
That's a performance thing.

116
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,876
Guy goes into the agent's office and he says,

117
00:05:56,920 --> 00:06:02,552
"I've got an act for you. Wait till you hear this."
"Tell me a little about it. What's the act?"

118
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,036
He says, "My wife and I come out on stage.

119
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,310
I've taken a lot of medicine,

120
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,271
prior to the appearance.

121
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:13,118
And I've eaten a lot of cabbages and things.

122
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:15,390
She lies down on the stage,

123
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,510
I squat over her, I pull down my pants.

124
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,475
And I shit in her mouth, it's mostly liquid.
It's like a diarrhoeic thing.

125
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:27,036
I try to include corn and things that will not
break down in the digestive system.

126
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:28,877
Peanuts, of course.

127
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,310
I try to get a lot of solid objects
so that's there's a little action too.

128
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,715
It's not just a stream of brown liquid.

129
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:38,673
And it all goes into...
I can hit her mouth pretty well.

130
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:42,315
I do have one polyp -
I have a large, kind of a haemorrhoidal polyp

131
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:45,033
that sometimes throws my aim off
and I have to...

132
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:47,719
It's kind of like Kentucky windage,
but I usually get it.

133
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:51,036
I can hear whether it's hitting
the hollow area of her throat.

134
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:54,629
So I get as much as I can in there
and then she gargles with it.

135
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:57,319
You hear the gargling. She gargles and gargles.

136
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,999
And then she swallows it. And...

137
00:07:00,040 --> 00:07:02,759
we're off- it's about five minutes total."

138
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:05,519
The guy says, "Oh. What do you call the act?"

139
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,835
"The Aristocrats."

140
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:11,668
<i>- I was making that up - I guess you could tell.</i>

141
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,349
The fun of it is where you improvise
on the grossness,

142
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,994
doing the John Coltrane version of it.

143
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:23,353
This joke was a joy for comics to tell mainly
because it was such a foul chunk of time

144
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,437
that you could just be describing
the most foul things.

145
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,278
There's nothing you could come up with
that would be wrong.

146
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,834
A blank slate, and you get to play.

147
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,279
You get to play.

148
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:36,949
How many new things could you think of
to make this group of people bizarre?

149
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,958
Whether it's a shuffleboard
up a nice animal's behind,

150
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,230
or whether people are swimming in manure.

151
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:45,238
A young girl comes on stage singing
Nearer My God To Thee

152
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,633
while juggling torches.

153
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:51,515
These are my two children - they pass gas to
the tune of What A Wonderful World, in unison.

154
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:54,757
One of the sons is playing a xylophone
with his cock.

155
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,155
A midget uncle with three dicks
coming out of his head.

156
00:07:57,200 --> 00:08:00,590
I come out, dressed as Hitler,
in crotchless panties.

157
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:03,916
I am catching the ping pong balls
and I am catching them in my ass.

158
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:08,351
He comes on my wife's tits. We wait
till it hardens and I chip it off with a chisel.

159
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,676
- Six midgets come out...
- They have sex in a kiddie pool,

160
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,790
full of beef entrails and aborted foetuses.

161
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,753
Little midgets, they all start coming, one by one.

162
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,519
And shoot thousands of jism
into hundred-dollar seats.

163
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,233
You know how the fountains at the Bellagio
are coordinated?

164
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:25,077
That was what these guys pulled off.

165
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,680
My grandmother, on the stage, has an abortion.

166
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,915
Gives birth to a three-pound Shetland pony.

167
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,315
The kids are Siamese twins,
attached at the ass.

168
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:35,352
My grandfather is the jockey.
Comes in third and paid 280.

169
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:39,518
The Siamese twins give each other
reach-arounds and jerk each other off.

170
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,996
<i>I don't know whether the object is to be
as offensive as possible</i>

171
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:47,033
or whether use it judiciously in the right places
as a build-up to the punch line.

172
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:50,755
I like to explain how to tell the joke -
you already heard the joke.

173
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,076
So when you wanna tell the joke
you have to make sure it's really filthy.

174
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,476
Guy goes into a talent agent's and says,
"I've have the greatest act."

175
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:59,829
"What's the act?" That's all you gotta memorise.

176
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:03,589
You can ad-lib, right up to the punch line.
All you gotta do is remember one word.

177
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:06,552
I always make it up, every time I tell it,
something different.

178
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,989
They would be naked,
something to do with peeing.

179
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:13,830
We're high-flying trapeze performers,
we fly over the audience doing triple gainers.

180
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:16,474
We piss over the first three rows.

181
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,748
Include faeces.

182
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:20,155
Takes a crap on stage, jumps in the pile of shit.

183
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,111
They take a big group shit.

184
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,596
The women slide on their asses
all the way up through this shit.

185
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:27,517
We just roll around in the shit.

186
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,552
And they start skating in the shit.
You know, people skate in shit.

187
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,956
Dabbles in the shit. Do a little dance.
Dabbles in piss, do a little dance.

188
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,470
Waddling in the shit and piss
and they're wiping it in each other's faces.

189
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,308
- One of them takes a shit.
- And everybody slides through it.

190
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,148
They end up in the splits in the shit.
They go into the splits and have a big finish.

191
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,873
That's the finish?
I thought they peed on each other.

192
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,399
Include vomit.

193
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,158
Gets sick, vomits. Eats the vomit.

194
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,553
Everybody starts puking.

195
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,989
One of them vomited,
and it made everybody else sick.

196
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,554
<i>Wait. Wait. That made everybody sick?</i>

197
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,230
Hey, shit and pee? No problem.
You add vomit - forget it.

198
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:05,431
Scatological... it's edge humour,
pushing the edge of what you can take.

199
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:08,631
And once the edge is crossed,
you get hysterical.

200
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,956
Me and my wife come up on stage.
She takes a dump in this big metal bucket.

201
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,434
She's got a bucket of shit,
pours on it the guy's head.

202
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,913
My son, he's three years old.

203
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,396
This is the part that's adorable.
Takes a bucket of shit, throws it in her face.

204
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,431
She takes the bucket of puke, shit and piss,

205
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,234
puts it over her head and starts parading
on stage like a little midget Nazi.

206
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:28,352
Such disgusting references, one after another.

207
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,868
It kind of makes its own gravy, this joke.

208
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:32,399
It's a disgusting joke.

209
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:37,195
It's shit. But the only reason I could say that
is because I'm really kind of an aristocrat.

210
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:42,079
Do they actually eat shit at any point
during the act?

211
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:42,836
Absolutely.

212
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,233
Shitting, and eating it.

213
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,432
She reaches into grandpa's diapers,
pulls out a bowl of shit and eats it like an apple.

214
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:51,348
I've heard bringing animals and bestiality into it.

215
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,118
I forgot the dog. There's a dog too.

216
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:54,752
And the dog! Uh-oh!

217
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:56,518
Then the dog fucks the girl.

218
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,994
That's called bestiality. It's in the Bible.

219
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,314
<i>It's in my diary.</i>

220
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,471
He says it's in his diary.

221
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:07,356
And I knew his dog.

222
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,755
I've heard er...

223
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,997
- Maybe we could do a version.
- (Laughs) All right.

224
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,157
Unbelievable - along with the dog,
the entire family is involved.

225
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:20,671
It's a family act which adds
such a fucked-up dimension to it, anyway.

226
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,119
Include children in the act.

227
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,312
Unspeakable acts that the children
are performing with and on each other.

228
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:30,069
People can get up on stage
if they wanna finger my niece,

229
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,758
or touch my nephew's penis.

230
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,509
There should be high-risk behaviour,
mixing of body fluids,

231
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:36,959
blood from every hole.

232
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,515
A lot of you are probably saying,
"Wait. Backtrack a little here.

233
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,235
Where did the blood come from?
You didn't say anything about blood."

234
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:50,515
Well, if a guy is fist-fucking his daughter,
who's young and her asshole is pretty small,

235
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,518
and this is a grown man, with a big hand.

236
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:55,516
He could be, like, a longshoreman.

237
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:58,074
He could have arms like Popeye.

238
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,590
Where it's like, the arm is like that wide
and her asshole is that small.

239
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:04,234
Think about that for a second. I'll wait.

240
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:07,829
Well, naturally she's gonna be bleeding.
I'm just making a point.

241
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,509
The people are abusing each other.
There's incest.

242
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,835
And all the things that cross lines.

243
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,998
So you get to play with
people's little danger zones.

244
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,156
I fucked my wife,
I fucked my sister, my son.

245
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,350
Everybody's fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

246
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,391
It's like a Tourette's syndrome joke.

247
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:27,557
<i>I'm horrified and yet drawn to it, it's like...</i>

248
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,673
a dog with three legs -
you don't wanna look but you just...

249
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,994
It's a perfect joke.

250
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,158
Just hearing out loud,
descriptions of "giddy shit-covered incest".

251
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:40,875
And other poems by Maya Angelou.

252
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:46,870
It is the one joke where you get to invent
every sick act you could imagine,

253
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:51,198
load it up into this joke and never actually
be accused of gilding the lily.

254
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,391
So the way I heard it was,
it was always a very sweet beginning.

255
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,671
That was what killed me.
The sweetness of the guy who walks in,

256
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:00,109
knocks on this very talented talent agency,
he says,

257
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:03,197
"We have an act.
Can I have a moment of your time?"

258
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,276
"You have one minute. Tell me about your act."

259
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:08,437
He says, "Well, it's a very different act.
It's a bit of a novelty.

260
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,598
Myself, my wife and kids. First I come out.
I'm in a tuxedo, my wife is in a gown.

261
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,153
The music starts, we do a dance.

262
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,236
My wife lifts her skirt, I start fucking her.

263
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:18,555
She's sucking me.
My son comes in, drops his draws.

264
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,070
Now he's fucking my wife.
I have a daughter, 15, she comes in.

265
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:25,749
My wife is going down on my son,
my son has his arm up my daughter.

266
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:27,870
It's a beautiful thing, music comes to a finish.

267
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,878
We're all fucking, and everybody is just...

268
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:34,230
My daughter is on her back,
she grabbing my son and myself in both hands.

269
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,474
My wife is singing.

270
00:13:35,520 --> 00:13:38,512
And then we all drop our draws
and take a huge shit on the stage."

271
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,438
Guy says, "That's a hell of an act.
What do you call yourselves?"

272
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,277
He says, "The Aristocrats."

273
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:48,474
So there is the joke, that you get to actually say
somebody had their arm up their daughter.

274
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,112
Which you don't really hear often.

275
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,073
Some people, when they tell it,
really focus on the faecal matter.

276
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:57,590
Other people really focus on the incest.

277
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:01,838
And to me, in my own personal life,
those two are rarely, if ever, separate.

278
00:14:01,880 --> 00:14:05,190
So shock is one only thing that happens.

279
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:08,596
It comes with it.
The other thing is the art of the joke.

280
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,870
You have to see pee first, instead of shit first.

281
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,912
Then you go to fuck, or then you go to fuck
and then pee and go to shit.

282
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:15,154
I prefer the pee first.

283
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,873
To me, you've gotta save the scatological
for the end.

284
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,356
If you put it in the middle, you have nothing
left to close. Fuck, fuck, suck.

285
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:23,516
And then on top of that, took a big shit.

286
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:27,439
You need that separation, I feel.
Otherwise, it's chaos.

287
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,948
I've got it as incest next to shit-eating.

288
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,958
<i>- Dog-fucking.
- Dog-fucking. I'm all about dog-fucking.</i>

289
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,798
Shit-eating, dog-fucking, incestuous.

290
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:38,957
Me and my wife go on stage.
We get undressed and I start nailing her.

291
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,992
As I'm fucking my wife
she takes a dump in this bucket.

292
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,749
My son comes out,
he pours kerosene in the bucket, lights it on fire.

293
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,509
Our trained dog Fifi comes out, jumps through
a ring of fire. My son fucks the dog.

294
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:51,835
My daughter comes out, the dog fucks her.

295
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,839
We all say, "Good night, you've been great."
Standing ovation every time.

296
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,677
It starts with a little dick-sucking.

297
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:00,393
The gals drop to their knees,
start sucking off the boys.

298
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,829
And let me tell you,
when my seven-year-old daughter

299
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,236
is giving a blow job to my eleven-year-old son,
it's priceless.

300
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,157
And then we move on to the fucking.

301
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:10,191
But... we move over one.

302
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,358
Now I'm fucking my daughter,
my son is fucking his grandmother

303
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,595
and my father is fucking my wife.

304
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,029
And then the denouement - the butt-fucking.

305
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,638
We move over one more time.

306
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:24,275
So I'm fucking my mother in the ass.
My son is fucking his mother in the ass.

307
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,709
My father is fucking his granddaughter
in the ass.

308
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,115
The men pull out, jerk off into a dish,

309
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,752
and the women slurp it down.

310
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,518
It's a real crowd-pleaser. Family act.

311
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,313
I go on stage, start to jerk off in a shot glass.

312
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,194
My wife comes out, takes a belt of my splooge,
takes off her skirt, shits in a bucket.

313
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,630
My son pulls the shit out of the bucket,
starts juggling it while he's pissing

314
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:46,468
into the mouth of his older sister,
who is being butt-fucked by the dog.

315
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,398
Grandpa drops his pants,
starts fucking the dog in the ass.

316
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,000
And the show ends with a big circle-jerk
around Grandma.

317
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,076
Here's the kicker. Grandma is dead.

318
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,235
I mean, it has be really filthy dirty - the act.

319
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:03,192
It should start off,
let's say it just starts off titillating.

320
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,674
And then it turns pornographic.

321
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,996
Then it starts to be the kind of thing
where if your daughter was involved

322
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,759
you'd have to go and help her,
you know, at any cost.

323
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,677
The police might not even step in.

324
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:17,315
And then the talent agent says,
"That's awful. What do you call the act?"

325
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,033
Like he wants to know,
like the name's the important thing.

326
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,119
I don't understand why he would say that.
It doesn't matter what it's called.

327
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,196
Because no-one is gonna book this show.

328
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,515
Where did these people find employment?

329
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,152
How did they develop this act?

330
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:33,158
What made them think this was entertaining?

331
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,715
I mean it's surprising they haven't...
that they're not all in jail.

332
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:37,909
I mean... and waiting...

333
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,552
waiting for the death penalty.

334
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:43,513
You can put people to death for what goes on
in the best versions of this joke.

335
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,917
Cos you're probably saying,
if you have any sense of human decency,

336
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:53,796
"Well, why didn't he stop them the minute
he saw the father unzipping his pants?"

337
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:58,960
And saying, "This is totally wrong. Call the cops.
Something horrible's happening.

338
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:03,596
This is a family
who are raping their own children.

339
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,393
And performing bestiality.

340
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,750
Why, oh, why, is he allowing this to happen?"

341
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:11,313
But that's a whole other story.

342
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,239
But, anyway, he says, "What is it called?"
Because in a joke that's what happens.

343
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,034
There's no legal system at all in play in a joke.

344
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:21,310
And then the guy goes, "The Aristocrats."

345
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,191
And I always throw in that.

346
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:26,874
That seems to make the whole joke.
"The Aristocrats."

347
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,150
- "The Aristocrats."
- Oh, yeah.

348
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,236
<i>- "The Aristocrats."</i>

349
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,270
I think it's all in the snap.

350
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,029
Here's for Drew.

351
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,389
<i>- How many people do that when they tell it?
- One.</i>

352
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:41,953
<i>- I'm the only one?
- Yeah.</i>

353
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,276
Really? Oh, man. I always, like...
I always tell it like that.

354
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,469
Do they do that or?

355
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:49,080
- "The Aristocrats."
- "The Aristocrats."

356
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,872
"The Aristocrats."

357
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:54,799
<i>- "The Aristo..."</i>

358
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,991
I never make it to the end. I crumble.

359
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,678
I say, "It's the loveliest joke."

360
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,393
Whoever told it to me,
they finish and are covered in sweat,

361
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:07,468
and they're covered in come,
and they're covered in shit. And...

362
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:12,552
"What do you call yourselves?"
"The Aristocrats."

363
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,350
Ah, it's so great.

364
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,073
<i>- I told you, I at least went like this.</i>

365
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,599
"Aristocrats."

366
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,471
Oh, no, I like...

367
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:25,308
That's really all there is to it.
You have to have blood, shit, piss,

368
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:27,510
and then erm... this!

369
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,836
So this cocksucker... What was it?

370
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:34,236
This cocksucker fucks his shit everywhere.

371
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,111
The cocksucker goes into a fucking...

372
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:39,835
and something faecal... Faecal or foetal?

373
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,995
And faecal is...

374
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:43,838
And the agent is fucking a dog,
the Pope in the corner.

375
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:46,155
The trouble is, I've never heard this joke.

376
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,397
The whole shit thing, I think it's just...

377
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:52,955
The punch line doesn't work. The guy says,
"I've got this act, a family act."

378
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:56,037
The guy says, "I've got shit everywhere.
I don't want a family act."

379
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:59,470
No doubt that could work.
He says, "What do you want?"

380
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,556
He goes, "Am I bothering you?"

381
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,357
You do it good. Have you done it?
Give it to me. I'll film you now.

382
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,551
It takes a lot more skill than it looks like
to tell it well.

383
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:10,158
All right. Here it is.

384
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,839
Three people walk into
a theatrical agent's office.

385
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:17,078
And they say, "We have an act to show you
and we're called the Aristocrats."

386
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,997
Fuck!

387
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,759
A guy goes into a talent agent's office.
People make it elaborate. Doesn't matter.

388
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,997
It's a steamy, little, horrible, horrible office.

389
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,395
There's barely room... It's so funny whenever...

390
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,158
Ever been to Joe Franklin's office?

391
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,590
<i>I've been in this office since 2000 BC.</i>

392
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,518
I was in a different office
until they condemned the building.

393
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:41,394
<i>Frank Sinatra sat here, Bette Midler.
Billy Crystal, Michael Jackson.</i>

394
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,953
<i>Julia Roberts was my secretary.</i>

395
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,434
<i>Produced the world's longest-running
TV show here.</i>

396
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:46,799
I'm Joe Franklin.

397
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:47,955
It's that office.

398
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:53,438
Man walks into an agent's office, and it's just
like a desk and a couple of chairs, a telephone.

399
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:56,756
Stop dancing around, motherfucker,
and tell the fucking thing.

400
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,553
Phone, you know, square room like a box.

401
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,715
All right, already!

402
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,069
You are fuckin' horrible. Tell the joke!

403
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,633
- Tell the thing!
- All right.

404
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:09,151
My wife comes out in a beautiful evening gown
and plays Tea For Two on a xylophone...

405
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,236
- With her cunt?
- No, no, no.

406
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,556
Then my grandparents come out
and they sing God Bless America.

407
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:17,194
- It's real patriotic.
- While fucking each other?

408
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,550
Yuck! Ever see an old woman's cunt?
It looks like Silly Putty.

409
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:23,876
So then they... You killed me.
You're killing me here.

410
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,229
You're a loser. You can't tell a fuckin' joke.

411
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:30,239
My son comes out, I shoot him in the head
and I fuck the bullet hole.

412
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:34,193
Then my daughter comes on stage.
She's a real sexy nine-year-old.

413
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,037
I hit her on the head with an axe handle,

414
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:38,116
burn her cunt with a curling iron

415
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,799
put a fish hook through my cock,
fuck her, kill her

416
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:43,035
and take a shit on her dead body.

417
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,310
That's the kind of delivery you need.

418
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:47,673
Cocksucker.

419
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,235
I actually stretched it out once
to two and a half hours.

420
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,953
- But I blew the punch line.

421
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,993
I got all the way to the end.
It involved white slavery and a zeppelin race.

422
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,759
<i>And then at the end, I go, "The Aristocats."</i>

423
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,233
Crats! Argh!

424
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:06,796
<i>It's the Aristocrats, not to be confused
with the wonderful Disney film The Aristocats.</i>

425
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,479
Often, I'd go,
"Be-pa-bada, he's sucking and she's..."

426
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:12,910
<i>"What do you call yourself?"
"The Aristocats. Oh, no - the Aristocrats!"</i>

427
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:17,476
So people would think that was part of the joke,
that the guy himself got the name wrong,

428
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,830
<i>and people would be saying,
"Why did he say cats and then crats?"</i>

429
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,440
He didn't. I just had a problem.
Which was more absurd.

430
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,519
They go, "Your joke takes 11 minutes to tell,
and you don't understand the punch line."

431
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:30,438
So it was a bit of a dangerous joke for me.

432
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,436
But I tell it to you to help others,

433
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:36,790
so the kids who follow me
won't live the horror and the shame that I did.

434
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:39,559
I hate jokes. I can't remember them.

435
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:44,515
The only joke I could ever tell
is about a man who goes into a pub in Glasgow.

436
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:48,758
He sees another guy and the other guy
hits him over the head with an iron bar.

437
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:52,315
And he says, "Hey! Ow!
Are you trying to be funny?"

438
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:55,557
And the guy says, "No..."
I'm sorry. Can we do that again?

439
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,874
I'm no fucking good at jokes.

440
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,677
I don't do jokes and I didn't even want to do this -
but when they beg, it's ridiculous.

441
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,154
With my kind of thing, it's always attitude.

442
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,955
I've never been one to pick up on jokes.
Not that there's anything wrong in it.

443
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,596
When I told it to Emo, he looked like, "God, that's
the joke I should have written but I never will."

444
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,119
That is an Emo joke.

445
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,675
These three guys walk in.
They said, "We have a great, great act."

446
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,756
They unzip their flies and pee on the floor.

447
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,268
Then they pull down their pants
and poo on the floor.

448
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,959
Then they put their fingers down their throats
and vomit.

449
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,558
Then they start slip-sliding.

450
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,434
The agent said, "What do you call yourselves?"
And they said, "The Aristocrats."

451
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,473
Then there are people who just really love
the writing of the joke and the mood of the joke.

452
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:43,435
And the agent says, "I love it,
but I'm not gonna book you until I see you live.

453
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,393
This weekend I'll see the Butt-Fucking
Fauntleroys and the Shit-Eating Grannies.

454
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,830
Presuming I like you as much as I think I will,
let me ask you this.

455
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,678
Are you married to the name the Aristocrats?"

456
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,750
There's a more writerly version of the joke.

457
00:22:56,800 --> 00:23:01,157
A manager is trying to sell performers
to a club owner.

458
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,317
The club owner goes,
"OK, yeah, what's your act do?"

459
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,555
"A girl comes out and sucks off a donkey,

460
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:10,229
and a guy comes out, pisses on the girl,
he pisses on the donkey..."

461
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,239
He says, "Listen, we have a classy joint here.
I'm not sure it's our kind of act."

462
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:15,998
"You'll enjoy the Aristocrats."

463
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:20,158
The manager had to come up quickly with
a name to sell the group, so there's motivation.

464
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:24,318
And it's a feelgood ending.
Gets you here and gets you here. You know?

465
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:28,035
<i>I like to think the manager's lying,
that they don't do all that stuff.</i>

466
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,675
They sing and they're funny but he now
has to go back and say, "I've sold you.

467
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,280
This is the sort of thing
you're gonna have to do.

468
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,550
You're gonna have to shag a donkey and shit..."

469
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,919
"What?!"

470
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:41,669
The guy with the saxophone, "Fuckin' what?
What was that donkey shit?"

471
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:44,393
And, of course,
everybody's style in telling the joke.

472
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:48,228
So the William Morris office
wants to work with this act - it's a family act.

473
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:51,477
The Smothers Brothers is a family act.
What do they do?

474
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:54,034
- They do some juggling.
- It's a jug...

475
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:56,150
- It's a juggling act?
- Juggling thing.

476
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,192
The father drops one of the clubs
and asks his son to pick it up,

477
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,593
so his dad...

478
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,393
dad just knees him right in the balls.

479
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,078
- You're putting me on.
- No, no.

480
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,398
Then the mother does a topless thing
and goes down on the father.

481
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,079
- No!
- The kids come out naked.

482
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:15,317
- Naked children?
- Then they do a sex act...

483
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,828
- And then they throw up.
- They throw up?

484
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:22,034
- Where have they worked?
- All the best places.

485
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,310
- All the best places?
- Do you wanna know...

486
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,796
- Do you wanna know what they're...
- Not necessarily.

487
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,910
Well, ask me! It's kind of important.

488
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,951
OK. What is their name?

489
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,636
The Aristocrats.

490
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:38,229
- The what? Aristocrats?
- The Aristocrats.

491
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:40,430
- You didn't think that's funny?
- No.

492
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,959
It's a classic.

493
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,513
What makes that a classic?

494
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:47,473
A classic withstands the test of time
and the Aristocrats is one of those classic jokes

495
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,671
that has gone through 50, 60, 70 years...

496
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:53,837
So, no matter how many times I hear it,
I'll still think it's funny?

497
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:56,553
Whenever you say "Aristocrats"
the audience falls down.

498
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,636
- I didn't.
- Well, you're a straight man.

499
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,432
You're not supposed to.

500
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:06,077
The Aristocrats is so much about
the kind of signature that a comedian puts on it.

501
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,759
That's what we do. You make it your own.

502
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:13,430
In the Amish version - the father flicks on a light,
the mother's using a radio remote,

503
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:16,392
watching television.
He goes, "What do you call yourselves?"

504
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,635
"Tis well we call ourselves the Aristocrats."

505
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,955
- That's the last thing...

506
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,673
First I come out on stage - and I am pregnant -

507
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:27,793
a friend of mine comes out
and he starts fucking me up the ass.

508
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,277
The baby starts sucking the penis
of the guy who's fucking me up the ass.

509
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:34,390
I start getting contractions and giving birth.

510
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:37,955
The baby starts coming out and come
starts coming out of the baby's mouth.

511
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:41,276
I mean, come on,
what is more beautiful than birth?

512
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:44,118
This woman comes into his office
and wants representation.

513
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,037
She says, "I'm the centrepiece.

514
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,311
My husband comes out, he bends down,
he goes down on me.

515
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:51,191
We used to have Grandma blowing Grandpa

516
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:54,198
while she had a kazoo out of her ass
playing Begin The Beguine."

517
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:57,869
But she claims that these days
she doesn't have the wind for it any more.

518
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:01,913
Personally, I think she's tired
of blowing the guy after 54 years.

519
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,111
Comedians have done it in the way they tell it,
but as you're listening

520
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:08,197
your own personal orientations
you bring to this joke,

521
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,196
so it's funny for different reasons.

522
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,318
Sure I coulda told it some other way.

523
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:15,397
Some scatological bullshit that these boys love.

524
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,396
No, I needed the woman's point of view.

525
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,353
And you notice, the first sex act
was the husband going down on the woman.

526
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:23,356
The man would have had a blowjob in there.

527
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:26,119
Grandma, by the way,
is a talent, a gift beyond.

528
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:30,073
If she was born in another era,
she could have been...

529
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,315
Liza Minnelli. That talented.

530
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:34,555
But because she was in
the wrong time and place,

531
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,149
she ended up playing Begin The Beguine
out of her asshole.

532
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,430
There are different rules for women.

533
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,677
Men, they can get...
Men are expected to talk dirty.

534
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:46,154
And women are supposed to be ladylike.

535
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,829
They won't take it from Phyllis
because that's not Phyllis's demeanour.

536
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:53,759
They'll definitely take it from me
because if I don't say "cock" they're pissed.

537
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,836
Males have a cruder sense of humour.

538
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,589
A female wouldn't ever really create that joke.

539
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,950
I'm sick of women going, "It's a guy thing."
It's a joke.

540
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,390
If funny is a guy thing, you know what?
I'll strap it on.

541
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:11,272
Cos I go and I do stuff and people say,
"What, you didn't curse?"

542
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:15,108
I'm trying not to do that, you know.
I'm trying to be genteel and shit.

543
00:27:15,160 --> 00:27:16,479
But it doesn't work for me.

544
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:18,590
So when I would tell a joke like this,

545
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,916
it would be all about dripping penises and...

546
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:25,919
maybe pulling foreskins back
and making helmets out of 'em.

547
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,837
It would be the whole thing.

548
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,472
<i>Why don't you do your version?</i>

549
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,080
Because you've already got versions like that.

550
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:34,236
<i>- I don't think we have.
- Oh, I bet you do.</i>

551
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,872
I bet you do. I know you do.

552
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:38,070
Four guys walk in. They say, "Let's see the act."

553
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:39,872
The four guys take their pants down,

554
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:43,390
they take their giant penises
and they take the foreskin and go like this.

555
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,954
They pull up the penises like this and they go,
"Wow."

556
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,673
They pull it down over themselves
and start to sing...

557
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,998
# Hallelujah, hallelujah

558
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,589
# I give the world to...

559
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,796
That's the kind of joke I would fuckin' tell.

560
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:06,919
How could you clean that joke up?
I guess you could say "making love".

561
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,599
But they're brothers and sisters
so it's already incest.

562
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,198
You're already in a big hole.

563
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:14,357
Well, actually, when the curtain rises,

564
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,678
there we are on stage -
me, my two daughters, my wife,

565
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,474
and a gorilla named Daisy
from the Belgian Congo.

566
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:28,277
My daughter pulls my index finger,
at which point I let out a thunderous fart.

567
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:32,313
My wife does a very sexy striptease dance
on a tom-tom.

568
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:38,549
Following that, I have a violent love affair
with the gorilla Daisy, if you know what I mean.

569
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:43,390
But have no fear, if there are any children,
they'll be brought up as Catholics, you see.

570
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,034
He was in purple, she was in heliotrope.

571
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,594
They would come in...
They had two black satchels.

572
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,154
They said, "We work in one. It's an olio."

573
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:53,873
And the band will go...

574
00:28:58,440 --> 00:29:02,319
And he opens up the black case
and there's a silver hammer in it.

575
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:08,677
His wife pulls out the chair
and he sits down upon the chair.

576
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:15,550
His wife takes the hammer
and with a great, swift movement -

577
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,034
bang! - hits her husband right in the forehead.

578
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,117
He goes ass over tea kettle back down,

579
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:24,789
over the couch, over the agents,
back in and pulls the drapes down.

580
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:30,277
The agent says, "My God,
I've never seen anything like that in my life!"

581
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,517
"Thank you very much."
He picks up the hammer, puts it away,

582
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:36,358
then he picks up that case,
picks up the other one.

583
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,992
They're about to leave and he says,

584
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:40,634
"Excuse me, just for curiosity,

585
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,875
what's in the other case?"

586
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,275
And he says, "Tylenol."

587
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,237
"And what's the name of your act?"

588
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:53,397
"We call ourselves... The Sophisticates."

589
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,593
That's how I heard it.

590
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:04,633
They are my generation of entertainer.
We were all together at the same time.

591
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,478
You had to work clean
because there were signs backstage,

592
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:09,875
"No dirty material. Nothing blue."

593
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,115
You got vaudeville and the chitlin' circuit.

594
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:13,718
A black comic can always be dirty.

595
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:17,548
Couldn't get on TV
so he weren't worried about who we offended.

596
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,318
They'd be dirty on stage. It didn't matter.

597
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,150
So, a joke where part of the fun is that you're
dirty, and they could tell it anytime they want.

598
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,236
Cocks and cunts. That's where it's at.

599
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,350
Seinfeld never cursed. I told you that.

600
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,833
- Be like Seinfeld.
- All right.

601
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:34,590
Did you ever notice when you kick your girlfriend
in the cunt she calls the cops on you?

602
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:38,750
In all of art it's the singer, not the song.

603
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:42,873
You see that when you hear jazz musicians
who play the same song over and over again.

604
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:46,037
You hear one note of Coltrane,
you know it's Coltrane.

605
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:49,709
But I never understood it
as so clear in comedy.

606
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,275
When someone tells the Aristocrats very clearly,
it's the singer, not the song.

607
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:56,280
Here's the joke. A guy goes into a talent agent's.

608
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,950
He says, "I just saw the most amazing act.
You should hire this act. It's incredible."

609
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,468
And the agent says,
"Well, tell me what happens."

610
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:06,353
He says: Well, there's a family out on the stage.

611
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:11,633
There's a husband and a wife
and three little girls, like 12, 8 and 4.

612
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:14,035
They're just sitting there and they're all reading.

613
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,232
There's a little ceramic ballerina
going around playing Mozart music.

614
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:20,794
It's very calm and the lighting is beautiful.

615
00:31:20,840 --> 00:31:23,308
And then the father gets up
and he walks off stage

616
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:25,157
and he comes back with flowers

617
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:28,351
and he gives one to the wife
and one to each of the daughters.

618
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,631
They go, "Oh, Daddy, we love you."
"You're my precious angels."

619
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,671
And everything is so nice. Smiling.

620
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,836
Then the father gets up and he leaves again

621
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:39,793
and he comes back with a big bottle of whisky
and a baseball bat.

622
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,432
He starts drinking the whisky

623
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:44,916
and he goes to the wife and starts
smashing her round the shoulders and legs.

624
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:48,236
He's banging her legs
and there's blood gushing everywhere

625
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:52,751
and the daughters are screaming and he chases
them and smashes them on the back of the leg.

626
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,109
There's screaming and blood everywhere.

627
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,991
And the guy said, "That's horrible..."

628
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:01,032
The agent said,
"That's the most horrible thing I've ever heard.

629
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:04,038
What could this thing be called?
What is this? What is it?"

630
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,072
And the guy said, "It's called the Aristocrats."

631
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:12,275
And then they just blankly looked
at each other for a while and then...

632
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,437
the agent said, "I'd like to see that, actually."

633
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,277
It's this family - the Cavanaghs -
Anne and William.

634
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:23,550
They're eating dinner and they just finish.

635
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,955
Their maid comes in and she clears the plates.

636
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,753
They have two children - Betsy and Timmy.

637
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,837
Anne suggests
that they all go into the drawing room,

638
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:35,793
where Anne then braids
Betsy's beautiful blonde hair.

639
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:38,513
The husband plays chess with Timmy.

640
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:41,916
Then the maid comes in
with strawberries and whipped cream.

641
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:44,235
They all eat a nice dessert.

642
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:46,999
That's the act.

643
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:50,953
<i>- What would you call an act like that?
- The Cocksucking Motherfuckers.</i>

644
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,677
There is another which uses the same word -
aristocrats - so maybe we can go there instead.

645
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,472
There were three missionaries -

646
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:05,798
a Catholic, a Buddhist and a Jew -
who were out in the middle of Africa.

647
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:08,149
They were caught by headhunters.

648
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,237
The chief came up and said,
"Good afternoon, gentlemen.

649
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:17,594
You have your options - death or...
you can meet the Aristocrats.

650
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,119
First is the Jewish rabbi.

651
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,720
"Have you made up your mind?"
He says, "Absolutely.

652
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,991
Perhaps there's an afterlife.
I'm not really sure about that.

653
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:27,031
We certainly value the life on Earth.

654
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:31,039
I have decided I will go with
meeting the Aristocrats."

655
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:35,870
Out come about 14 men,
wearing just the skimpiest little loincloths.

656
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,992
They ream him in every orifice.

657
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,508
They throw his body up.
They throw his body down.

658
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:45,109
He is completely covered
with aborigine spermatozoa.

659
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:50,518
They leave him, basically,
as a floppy little rag doll, over in the bushes.

660
00:33:50,560 --> 00:33:53,074
He asks the Catholic priest, "How about you?"

661
00:33:53,120 --> 00:33:58,990
"Still the same deal?" And he says, "Yeah,
you can either die or deal with the Aristocrats."

662
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:04,592
He says, "Horrible as that is,
I am no stranger to certain aspects of it.

663
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:09,760
I do see that the man over there is still breathing.
I could stay alive and help my parishioners.

664
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:12,473
I will take the... I guess, the Aristocrats.

665
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,795
It's same song, second verse.

666
00:34:14,840 --> 00:34:18,230
They have him in so many ways
that he has never even dreamt of.

667
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:22,478
He is lying, panting barely audible breaths,
lying in the underbrush.

668
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,911
The Buddhist says, "I believe
that we are only here for a short time anyway.

669
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,791
I will take death."

670
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,593
The chief says, "OK, fine. Death it is.

671
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,631
But, first, the Aristocrats."

672
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:43,517
So, that'll be my Aristocrats joke.
You've got 75 people telling the fucking thing.

673
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:48,236
This joke is one of those songs, I guess,
like Mr Tambourine Man.

674
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,317
You could sing it like Bob Dylan
or you could sing it like The Byrds.

675
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,430
You could sing it rough or make it sweet.

676
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:55,550
There's not that many jokes like this.

677
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:59,115
We were influenced
by one of the greatest juggling acts of all time.

678
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:03,950
- They'd be completely naked.
- At this point, he would penetrate the other guy.

679
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:07,629
The top guy would actually defecate
on the bottom guy.

680
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,832
They would actually juggle six severed, flaming,
elephant penises.

681
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,949
Yeah.

682
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,070
The were called The Incredible Towering

683
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,874
Flaming Naked
Elephant Penis Juggling Brothers.

684
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:21,115
They changed it to the Aristocrats.

685
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,755
You can make the joke funny
and still keep it in your personality.

686
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,836
I saw Christopher Walken tell that story.

687
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:30,714
I think it was James Lipton's
Cocksucking Extravaganza.

688
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,593
He laid claim to the story actually happening.

689
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:44,432
This happened. My uncle was a talent agent.
Sort of a Broadway Danny Rose sort of guy.

690
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,789
A man comes in and says to my uncle,

691
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,030
"I think I might have the act
that you're looking for.

692
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,196
It involves my whole family."

693
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:55,595
My uncle stopped him and said...

694
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,152
"That's crazy. What do you mean,
your whole family?"

695
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:05,352
The man says, "A gift my wife has
is unloaded on the audience

696
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,710
and that is projectile vomiting.

697
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,239
It's all over the front row.

698
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:14,671
Gallagher, that putz, would wish... this sort of...

699
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:21,674
<i>... this sort of thing was possible
from a watermelon. Forget it."</i>

700
00:36:23,840 --> 00:36:27,753
This is what's happening to my uncle.
He starts to chuckle.

701
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,234
But he also is frightened for his life.

702
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:35,070
He senses, "Ask the name first, then get him out.

703
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,715
Don't give him the bum's rush
cos this fuck will kill you. Clearly."

704
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:46,149
To me, in this joke,
you get to show off your writing. Sort of.

705
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:51,310
A family walks into the agent's office
and they want to audition their new act.

706
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:55,069
Mom does a naked cartwheel through the air
and lands flat on her back.

707
00:36:55,120 --> 00:36:58,112
She spreads her legs wide
and turns over to reveal...

708
00:36:58,160 --> 00:37:00,196
a cherry-coloured ass.

709
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:02,800
Son comes over and begins to jack off.

710
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:06,310
The vigour of youth allows him to do this
over and over again.

711
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:12,199
Sis, whose tits are practically non-existent,
suddenly gets down on all fours.

712
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:16,552
Her hairless paper cut begins twitching
with anticipation.

713
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,670
Dad springs into action.

714
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:21,996
He spins his daughter around
and gives her a little bit of 69.

715
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:25,396
Just then there's a blinding spray
that covers the entire family

716
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:30,275
and Grandma rides in on a red bicycle,
pisses all over everyone, and says, "Ta-da!"

717
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,312
The agent says, "That's amazing.
What do you call yourselves?"

718
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:36,477
Grandma says..."The Aristocrats."

719
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:43,071
We saw the act and it just dumbstruck Teller,
quite literally.

720
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:44,519
I can go into the whole thing.

721
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:47,757
The father who played the bagpipes out his ass,

722
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:52,078
the mother who did this whole weird thing
with menstrual blood, and er...

723
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:56,830
Yeah, beautiful. But the part that killed us
the most was this little cute kid. About six?

724
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,474
The kid had this enormous cock.

725
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:01,078
It was the size of... you know...

726
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:03,759
Oh, like the size of a bottle, like that.

727
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,997
And he started jerking and jerking
and jerking and jerking.

728
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:11,397
Just as he got to the final end,
he would just jerk, jerk, and the kid had...

729
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,477
The whole head of his cock blew off.

730
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,796
And we said, "Fabulous. Fabulous."

731
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:21,833
Teller couldn't talk any longer.
He was just shocked. Dumbstruck.

732
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:23,757
Just never spoke again.

733
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:28,874
The kid was also dumbstruck.
He had the head of his cock blown off.

734
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,879
You're telling a joke in your own words
and creating your own setup.

735
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:35,878
If that can be personalised,
then that's a form of writing.

736
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,037
First I come in there
and I start to get loosened up a little bit.

737
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,198
Then I start to stretch my face.

738
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,800
Then I like to celebrate the theatre. Comedy.

739
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,557
Tragedy.

740
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,194
And then Uncle Louie comes in.

741
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,357
And then cousin Eddie.
He just came back from Russia with the army.

742
00:38:57,120 --> 00:39:00,271
# Deutschland Deutschland, Yugoslavia

743
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,308
I got it.

744
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,949
And then, Aunt Sadie comes in
and does an acrobatic number.

745
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,558
Hey-oh!

746
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:14,354
A guy goes into a talent agent and he says,
"Dude, check it out. I've got a great act."

747
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,198
He's like, "It's not a fuckin' prop act, is it?"

748
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:20,152
I would tell that joke
but I only work off prompter.

749
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:23,829
So unless I can look in the prompter and see...

750
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:29,113
Was it, "Fingering the daughter and eating shit
out of the grandmother's ass"?

751
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:34,280
I'd hate to get something like that wrong
cos it seems to be so delicately worded.

752
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:05,276
We all have different kinds of cartoons
playing in the comic's mind.

753
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,551
Murray the agent barges into
Stan the variety booker's office.

754
00:41:08,600 --> 00:41:10,670
Stan goes, "No, no, no! No, you don't!

755
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,553
You always bring me
the worst acts in the universe."

756
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,876
"This one is completely different, Stan,
it's a family act.

757
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:20,833
First the father comes out,
naked as the day he was born.

758
00:41:20,880 --> 00:41:22,632
And he sets up a ladder.

759
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,592
Then Mom comes out,
and she looks fantastic for her age.

760
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:29,918
She climbs halfway up the ladder,
naked as the day she was born.

761
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:34,033
Then Junior steps out, a strapping young lad,
naked as the day he was born.

762
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,514
And he climbs all the way
to the top of the ladder.

763
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,516
Dad lights a cigar, gets it smoking good,

764
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:42,792
sticks it in Mom's ass, she blows a smoke ring
out of her twat and the son dives through it."

765
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:46,037
Everybody loves it in circuses
where they fit a bunch of clowns in a car,

766
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:50,596
and they all come out, and in the audience
you see the kids' eyes just open up with awe.

767
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,437
It's just the most amazing thing.

768
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,951
It's like that,
except we all fit into this woman's cunt.

769
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,389
She rides around a little ring on a bicycle,

770
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:03,232
and when she stops, we all pop out of her cunt

771
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:07,159
and spit cunt juice at the audience,
which gets them involved.

772
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:10,192
They get a little wet -
it's like kind of a Gallagher thing.

773
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,708
Sometimes there's mucous
and little cunt loogies.

774
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:16,355
And we can make little animals
and things like that out of the...

775
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:17,992
the cunt snot.

776
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,031
And we give those to the kids.

777
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:21,718
Terrific.

778
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:24,228
Others will have more irony
or slightly more sarcasm.

779
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,918
A wry sense of looking at the world.

780
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:29,669
The guy goes in to get an agent.
The agent says, "What do you guys do?"

781
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,870
"My wife and I..." Have you heard this one?

782
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,273
<i>It wouldn't be The Onion
if it didn't have Jesus in it.</i>

783
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:37,914
We have to have the grandfather
fucking Jesus in the ass.

784
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:40,428
You know what is offensive now? Gay bashing.

785
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:43,677
But if it's gay bashing,
we can't have any gay sex in the act.

786
00:42:43,720 --> 00:42:47,315
Throwing in gay sex has never deterred anyone
from bashing gays.

787
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:49,351
I think they could do both.

788
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:52,198
I think they could sodomise Jesus up the ass
and say...

789
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:55,352
"This is because you're a faggot."

790
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,197
"You probably like this, faggot!"

791
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,674
There are guys who are made to tell this joke.

792
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:04,840
Some people think I have a reputation of being
a dirty comedian. I don't want to expose that.

793
00:43:04,880 --> 00:43:07,348
I'm really a family kind of oriented guy.

794
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,311
Which brings me to this joke.

795
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:15,790
Oh, Saget. Now there is a man who walks
around telling the Aristocrat joke in life.

796
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:18,513
That's my friend Paul,
and I'm looking at his dinger.

797
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:21,632
He's got a very huge wiener. It's about that big.

798
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,994
I believe that's Shandling's joke. I'm pretty sure.

799
00:43:25,040 --> 00:43:27,873
When you lift something, it better be a cock.

800
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,390
Once for Hanukkah, he gave me...
some slim Tampax.

801
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,716
He said, "Leave 'em out,
so guys will think you're really tight."

802
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,392
Here we go. This family...

803
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:39,237
mother, father and four kids.

804
00:43:39,280 --> 00:43:44,070
Doesn't matter if they're boys or girls,
they're going to be used anyway as just a hole.

805
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:47,192
It's what this joke's about anyway,
using your kid...

806
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:50,949
They have a paper route,
they go to school... and then you fuck 'em.

807
00:43:51,000 --> 00:43:56,074
His aim is to get as many disgusting thoughts
into sentences as possible.

808
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,917
The agent goes, "What do you people do?"

809
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:00,269
The father's, like, "Watch us."

810
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:02,914
He takes his wife's bra,
and he rips off her underwear,

811
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:06,919
he takes some of her pubes with it - it's horrible.
Blood starts dripping down her legs.

812
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:09,633
He pulls out the tampon, throws it at the window
and it sticks.

813
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,399
They go down on each other
in different configurations...

814
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,954
it's 69, it's 29 - cos the kids are young - it's 9...

815
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,913
The father bends his kid over on the guy's desk
and he's taking him from behind,

816
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,439
which isn't right.

817
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,278
If any of you people are doing this
that are watching this,

818
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:26,710
if you're having sex with your family,
I don't condone it, it's wrong.

819
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:29,957
I could do a lot of PSAs to support
"Do not fuck your family".

820
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:31,956
So they're all fucking each other, right?

821
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:35,595
All of a sudden, the kid can't take it,
diarrhoea starts squirting from his ass.

822
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,517
It's like a haemorrhaging shit ass.

823
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:42,111
The kid starts spinning in a circle cos he can't
control it, it's like Curly and the Stooges.

824
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,631
The projectile shit is just flying out,
it's going all over the room, like spin art.

825
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:49,877
You don't know whether
to shit or puke in this room.

826
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,195
What the fuck am I doing?

827
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:57,837
Then... Wait, there's more.

828
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:00,269
You get to be a comic for comics.

829
00:45:00,320 --> 00:45:02,993
This is... This is fun.

830
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,031
They start singing Make 'Em Laugh.

831
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,593
And Be A Clown.

832
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,313
The father's haemorrhoid pops, so he grabs it
and puts it on the end of his nose,

833
00:45:13,360 --> 00:45:15,669
like Emmett Kelly - except he's covered in shit.

834
00:45:15,720 --> 00:45:17,711
Then they all start making out.

835
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:21,191
You know, they're...

836
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,639
All kidding aside.

837
00:45:22,680 --> 00:45:27,037
By the way, this would be a good time right now
to take your pants off and get some lotion.

838
00:45:27,080 --> 00:45:31,358
That's what happens next with this family.
They just start jacking and...

839
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:38,515
Can I get a copy of this? I'd like to send it
to the kids on the show Full House.

840
00:45:38,560 --> 00:45:43,998
It was just an opportunity to be vile
for no reason at all. So I used to love it.

841
00:45:44,040 --> 00:45:48,750
Father can't help himself, smacks his wife
in the mouth, knocks all of her teeth out.

842
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:53,669
Sticks his fist, accidentally, mind you,
down her toothless throat.

843
00:45:53,720 --> 00:45:56,393
Unbelievably, he actually fists her neck.

844
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,829
I love the idea of floating right past that,

845
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:03,192
as if this is the most normal...
and the thing you're most used to doing.

846
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:05,310
I come inside my daughter's asshole.

847
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,835
And then my wife feltches...
I'm not sure if you're familiar with feltching.

848
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:13,031
Feltching is where you fuck someone in the ass
and then you...

849
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:14,832
<i>... suck the come out.</i>

850
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,552
Tasty.

851
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,795
Jis straight is good,

852
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:21,308
but if it has that little taste of shit...

853
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:24,714
We also have the dirty Sanchez.

854
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:28,389
That's when you fuck someone in the ass,
pull it out and give the girl a moustache,

855
00:46:28,440 --> 00:46:29,839
with the shit on your dick.

856
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:31,598
Mexican moustache.

857
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:33,471
Then there's the strawberry shortcake.

858
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,353
He jerks off on her face
and punches her in the nose.

859
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,550
She's bleeding and there's white...

860
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:41,709
A rusty trombone, obviously, you know.

861
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:44,035
Come on. The rusty trombone
people have heard of.

862
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,150
You spread a man's asshole,

863
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:48,270
and then there's the rusty hole...

864
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,118
And I lick his ass
while I reach around and jerk him off.

865
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,151
And that's how you...

866
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:58,638
Space docking, where you take a shit
in a girl's pussy. I don't think anyone has.

867
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,797
I would make sure
that I was treating those things as...

868
00:47:02,840 --> 00:47:07,277
"And then he took the carburettor, and
he began to take the carburettor apart..."

869
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:11,233
"I'm fucking my daughter, understand,
while she's knobbing my son."

870
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:12,998
And he's not trying to be foul.

871
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:17,192
He believes..."It's really quite novel
what we do and you'd be crazy not to hire us."

872
00:47:17,240 --> 00:47:19,117
Make it as matter of fact as possible.

873
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:23,870
That's the joy for me of saying something
that violates someone's boundaries.

874
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:26,798
The mother clips the nails off her hand,
puts it up her daughter

875
00:47:26,840 --> 00:47:28,717
and starts working her like a puppet.

876
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:32,036
The father's got smelling salts
that he's been giving to his kids,

877
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:34,071
who keep passing out.

878
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:37,829
Their heads are bleeding and they've been
anally raped in front of an agent...

879
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:40,917
The mother had a big boil on her back -
that popped.

880
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,235
Always make sure you haven't left anything out,

881
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,953
because you know
there's always the chance to be topped.

882
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,878
He takes out his penis
and goes over to the agent's desk.

883
00:47:48,920 --> 00:47:51,309
He starts slamming his dick in the drawer.

884
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,749
Just flattens it right out like a bookmark.

885
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,475
Then starts smacking his kids with it,
like a wet towel at the gym.

886
00:47:57,520 --> 00:47:59,875
He knocks one of his kids in the eye
and it pops out.

887
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:02,480
He looks at that as an opportunity, mind you.

888
00:48:02,520 --> 00:48:06,229
Just trying to go further
than anyone had ever gone before.

889
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,192
He just puts his flat wiener
right in that eye socket.

890
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:12,118
Gets caught -
gets caught on the back of his retina.

891
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:14,230
He starts trying to get him off of him,

892
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,111
and he's cock-eyed... no.

893
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:17,718
So all this was going on...

894
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,320
I gotta go on. I'm sorry, I got people to entertain.

895
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:22,237
Excuse me.

896
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:24,157
What is so unique about this joke,

897
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:28,079
is that it's so absurdly front loaded
that it's almost the opposite of a joke.

898
00:48:28,120 --> 00:48:30,475
Steam is built up in the setup.

899
00:48:30,520 --> 00:48:33,193
There's something very satisfying
in that structure.

900
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,391
Momentum, momentum, momentum and...
the punch line means nothing.

901
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,635
There's something very satisfying in that.

902
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:40,557
But it is the kind of joke that, you know,

903
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:44,434
if you spent this much time on a setup
and the punch line was "Aristocrats"...

904
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:46,471
most people are gonna go...

905
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:49,832
He says, "The Aristocrats."

906
00:48:49,880 --> 00:48:51,871
Oh, lord.

907
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:54,791
Here, have some money.

908
00:48:54,840 --> 00:48:57,559
The punch line is almost intentionally...

909
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:00,672
not lame, but weaker than
you might have expected it to be.

910
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,792
But the journey is so much fun
that you just don't care.

911
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,671
I'm not even sure what this means.

912
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:09,633
The punch line can be the icing on the cake,
but the cake can be really delicious.

913
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,274
They slice a line
that runs up the middle of a testicle,

914
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:14,436
it's like a butterfly shrimp at Benihana.

915
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:16,994
Now it looks like some strange sort of mouth.

916
00:49:17,040 --> 00:49:18,678
They have ventriloquist nut sacks.

917
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,870
Then they brought some children out on stage.

918
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:24,833
That was sweet. One guy lays down...
he's got a rod the size of my arm...

919
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,279
and balanced the kid,
up his ass on the guy's rod.

920
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:32,472
Then they jerk the kid off, get the kid hard,
they put another naked kid, his ass on that...

921
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,796
- They're building like a tower.
- Something you gotta see to believe.

922
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:39,628
By spinning each kid in a different direction,
you get this kind of thing...

923
00:49:39,680 --> 00:49:41,511
It was lovely and had great lighting.

924
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:44,552
There are people who tell it
who tunnel and make it great,

925
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:46,830
and make the act more interesting and fabulous.

926
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,634
And then the animal part came on.
I'm trying to remember everything I saw.

927
00:49:50,680 --> 00:49:54,468
- Donkey, Ilama, camel...
- Something that looked like a bison, I guess...

928
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:57,512
An animal that they brought out
that you were rubbing.

929
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,676
- That wasn't an animal.
- What was it?

930
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,312
It wasn't an animal.

931
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:03,555
We're so conditioned now to sitcom humour,

932
00:50:03,600 --> 00:50:05,830
where it's setup, punch line.

933
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:09,156
They think they're missing it,
they don't know the journey is the fun.

934
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:13,193
What intrigues me is how in America
you can laugh at something like Aristocrats.

935
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,596
You don't have aristocrats.
Why does that work in America?

936
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:19,639
That much foul filth needs a word
like "aristocrats".

937
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:23,559
It almost sounds quaint that you can put
a cute cap on something that rancid

938
00:50:23,600 --> 00:50:26,672
that's just as ugly as you can be,
and is like "the Aristocrats".

939
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,676
A form of society that doesn't even exist.

940
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,395
I'm not gonna lie. The first time I heard it,
I said, "What's an aristocrat?"

941
00:50:32,440 --> 00:50:33,668
I had no idea.

942
00:50:33,720 --> 00:50:35,233
Just this odd word.

943
00:50:35,280 --> 00:50:38,192
But it's the only word that would satisfy
that hunk of filth.

944
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,676
I have heard the twist of calling them
"the Sophisticates."

945
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:44,234
Also works. Actually, maybe even a little better.

946
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,999
Maybe a little better.
That's nice, the Sophisticates.

947
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,031
I personally think it's a much better joke.

948
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:52,755
It's the goofiness of a person
turning the joke upon themselves.

949
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,439
Whereas aristocrats are seldom self-appointed.

950
00:50:55,480 --> 00:50:58,631
- Therefore the joke is satire.
- That's a political statement.

951
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,989
You know what would be great to add to this?

952
00:51:02,040 --> 00:51:04,031
Just add Republican.

953
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,514
And the Democrats.
It's not about them and Republicans.

954
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,233
Because of the language and the images,

955
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,236
that gives it a political slant.

956
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:16,717
I don't think the original intent was
to do anything but tell a wild joke.

957
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:20,150
There's no act in England
that an aristocrat wouldn't do...

958
00:51:21,160 --> 00:51:25,358
<i>... that doesn't involve shagging animals
or fist-fucking cows, or anything.</i>

959
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,870
This was the evening of
Monty Python And The Holy Grail.

960
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:33,835
As you can see, there's our friend Eric Idle,
George Harrison and Terry Gilliam.

961
00:51:33,880 --> 00:51:35,677
We were just telling jokes,

962
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:40,032
and George said, "Instead of aristocrat
or sophisticates, we use royalty."

963
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,110
Which is an even funnier joke.

964
00:51:43,160 --> 00:51:45,993
An English one is "debonairs",
but that doesn't grab me.

965
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:48,679
When I heard it, it was the Debonairs.

966
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,517
Which I think is even funnier.

967
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:53,037
It has a certain je ne sais quoi.

968
00:51:53,080 --> 00:51:55,071
The Debonairs? I like that.

969
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,111
The Aristocrats is pretty funny,
the more you think about it.

970
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,913
Whatever the other guys are telling you,
I have the original.

971
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:06,272
People signed the Declaration of Independence,
there was a big party - that's the way it was told.

972
00:52:06,320 --> 00:52:10,632
I'm from Philadelphia. Go to Independence Hall,
see the Liberty Bell, the Declaration.

973
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:14,559
There is a framed sketch
of the original telling of the Aristocrats.

974
00:52:14,600 --> 00:52:16,591
And you see Ben Franklin laughing,

975
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:18,631
and you see Betsy Roth taking a dump.

976
00:52:18,680 --> 00:52:23,549
Because the original joke, when they slid
through the shit and vomit, they hit the bell.

977
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:25,591
And that's what cracked the bell.

978
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,359
Look at the signers,
there's one very heavy signer.

979
00:52:28,400 --> 00:52:30,197
He's the one that fucked up the bell.

980
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:34,791
I told the original. People are gonna tell the
Aristocrats a different way. That's fucked.

981
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,558
Er... this joke...

982
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:40,149
my grandfather told my father,
he heard it from his grandfather...

983
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:41,952
It goes all the way back, this joke.

984
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,072
Sometimes it was known as
the tale of Pushtuchkin,

985
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,236
the gay rabbi.

986
00:52:58,040 --> 00:53:00,031
Was ist das? Die Aristocrats!

987
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,514
There's a similar tale, it gets mixed up.

988
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:09,154
My grandfather took this joke so far,

989
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:11,589
his entire life - he lived 67 years -

990
00:53:11,640 --> 00:53:13,676
always in a constant state of this joke.

991
00:53:13,720 --> 00:53:16,029
Constant - eat, everything he did, marry...

992
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:17,513
children, everything.

993
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:19,198
It was setup, setup, setup, setup.

994
00:53:19,240 --> 00:53:21,800
And then, just the moment he died, punch line.

995
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:25,150
"What do they call this act?" "The Aristocrats."
He's dead.

996
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,838
And you know, we laughed.

997
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:30,156
Grandpa's dead
and we went, "Oh, the Aristocrats!"

998
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:32,791
I get it all of a sudden, his entire life.

999
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:33,955
I get this.

1000
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:36,468
We thought, and we were right,
that he was crazy.

1001
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,670
What he did, no-one will top him.

1002
00:53:38,720 --> 00:53:40,711
No-one will top this guy.

1003
00:53:40,760 --> 00:53:42,113
Uncle Yanush.

1004
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,878
My grandfather's...

1005
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:45,831
See, that's bad improv right there.

1006
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,598
My grandfather, Uncle Yanush.

1007
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,632
I remember being at school
and I remember going home,

1008
00:53:51,680 --> 00:53:54,672
and my grandmother sitting me down
and telling me the joke.

1009
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,836
She's from Poland, so she only spoke Yiddish.

1010
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:58,950
The only English word she knew was "cunt".

1011
00:53:59,000 --> 00:54:00,991
I remember "cunt".

1012
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:03,031
And I remember her saying, "Eat, eat."

1013
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,031
And "cunt".

1014
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:10,196
You know, now that I think back on it,
it's probably wrong.

1015
00:54:11,240 --> 00:54:13,879
<i>There was this story my mother used to tell me.</i>

1016
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:16,593
There was a goat in Tammy

1017
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,710
that my father got very involved with

1018
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:21,832
while he was working -
they went on the road with this act.

1019
00:54:21,880 --> 00:54:26,954
My father was blowing this goat over at MGM
and my mother walked in on them.

1020
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:29,878
And my mother just thought that was adorable.

1021
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,434
My mother is a golden shower queen.

1022
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:37,031
The original movie of Singin' In The Rain
was a huge golden shower extravaganza.

1023
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:39,992
But it didn't get past the censors,
which is a shame,

1024
00:54:40,040 --> 00:54:43,794
because there were some wonderful numbers
with Mickey Rooney...

1025
00:54:43,840 --> 00:54:45,831
who was huge with fisting.

1026
00:54:45,880 --> 00:54:49,190
In the early days in Hollywood,
it was completely accepted.

1027
00:54:49,240 --> 00:54:51,151
I always love show business jokes.

1028
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,111
These ones that seem a little more inside.

1029
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:55,355
And in a very sort of twisted, warped way,

1030
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:59,791
this disgusting, foul joke is a joke about
the sweet old days of show business.

1031
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:05,196
I'm going to sit on top of the
piano and fit the whole thing in my vagina.

1032
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,959
The percussionist -
I love that word, "percussionist" -

1033
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,992
is gonna take his triangle,
put it in front of my triangle,

1034
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:14,749
and kling-a-ling-a-ling with the trolley,
just the way mama sang it.

1035
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,873
And then I'm gonna take the banger
to the triangle, and kling-a-ling it,

1036
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:24,040
until my clitoris swells up
into a large Macy's Day Parade balloon.

1037
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,877
I'm gonna take it and stretch it out,

1038
00:55:25,920 --> 00:55:29,390
and I'm gonna wrap it round the microphone
cord and fling it over my shoulder

1039
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:30,953
the way Mama used to do.

1040
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,319
As I'm singing,

1041
00:55:32,360 --> 00:55:35,750
# What'll I have that I don't...
... have

1042
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,158
Where did that note go?

1043
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:41,272
And then the rest of the band's
gonna jump up, and we're gonna sing.

1044
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:45,074
# Shine your shoes, shine your shoes

1045
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:47,680
And I'm gonna shine my shoes
with my vagina juices,

1046
00:55:47,720 --> 00:55:51,110
put 'em back on, tap, tap, tap, do a split,
and that's the act.

1047
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:52,752
I'm gonna call it...

1048
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:55,751
<i>... the Aristocrats.</i>

1049
00:55:56,800 --> 00:55:58,791
Isn't that terrific?

1050
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:02,596
This is a joke exclusive to show business.

1051
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:05,996
You'd never hear a physicist going,
"It's a muon, you cunt."

1052
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:10,077
I have a joke very similar to
"That's why the group is called Aristocrats",

1053
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,031
in the show business theme with a nice turn.

1054
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:15,231
There's an audition for piano player
at a very exclusive bar.

1055
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,431
A guy shows up, and the owner says,
"This is a very exclusive place.

1056
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:22,109
I'd like you to play all different styles of music,
but they have to be classy."

1057
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,071
The guy says, "I can do anything."

1058
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:27,112
He plays the most beautiful song
the owner's ever heard.

1059
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,630
He says, "I've never heard that before."
"I wrote it myself."

1060
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:32,033
"What's it called?"

1061
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:35,834
"It's called 'My dog was fucking me in the ass
while my cat was licking my balls'."

1062
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,314
"That's awful. Do you have any other songs?"

1063
00:56:38,360 --> 00:56:40,590
"I have a wonderful thing I'll play for you."

1064
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,155
He plays this kind of jazzy tune and they say,
"Great! What was that?"

1065
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,668
He says, "I ate your sister's bloody tampon."

1066
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,995
"Hey, this a classy place. No more of that."

1067
00:56:49,040 --> 00:56:50,996
He goes, "Oh, fine. Fine."

1068
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:53,156
"I really like your songs, I wanna hire you.

1069
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:56,556
Play for my customers, just don't tell them
any names of your songs."

1070
00:56:56,600 --> 00:57:01,151
That night he starts playing the piano and the
crowd goes crazy, the songs were beautiful.

1071
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:04,397
After an hour he says,
"Give me a break, I've gotta go to the can."

1072
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:07,716
He goes to the bathroom. On his way out,
he forgets to zip up his pants.

1073
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:11,230
Somebody says, "You know, your zipper's
undone and your dick's hanging out."

1074
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:13,589
He says, "Know it? I wrote it!"

1075
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:18,358
That's what a group of entertainers
have in common.

1076
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:20,516
They understand they've seen shitty acts.

1077
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:23,597
The worst bar band in Shitsville, Ohio,

1078
00:57:23,640 --> 00:57:25,631
always have a glorious name,

1079
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,797
like, The Incredible Diamond-Studded
Reefer Tones.

1080
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:31,195
It's done in every aspect of life.

1081
00:57:31,240 --> 00:57:34,357
You'll see a little rundown greasy spoon diner,

1082
00:57:34,400 --> 00:57:36,550
calling itself The Gourmet Corner.

1083
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,672
Besides from the humour of the joke
there's a sadness,

1084
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,996
that these people had no self-realisation

1085
00:57:43,040 --> 00:57:46,191
that what their act was
would get them absolutely no place.

1086
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,754
Yet they call themselves the Aristocrats,

1087
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:53,794
because they're clinging to
the very last vestige of respectability.

1088
00:57:53,840 --> 00:57:56,559
Absolutely no class, absolutely horrible.

1089
00:57:56,600 --> 00:57:59,319
But they are in show business
and they are aristocrats.

1090
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:03,069
I don't put the Aristocrats on my résumé
any more, you know.

1091
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:06,192
It doesn't take away from, like, my pride.

1092
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:09,550
I actually was an Aristocrat.

1093
00:58:09,600 --> 00:58:12,558
It's kinda weird to be a part of that legend.

1094
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:16,673
It was my mom, my dad, me, my brother...
and my nana.

1095
00:58:16,720 --> 00:58:18,631
My father would come out on stage,

1096
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,911
the music would play
and he would start masturbating.

1097
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:23,837
My brother comes out,

1098
00:58:23,880 --> 00:58:27,475
they do, like a mutual masturbation,
kind of like a Dueling Banjos.

1099
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,750
They're holding hands and they spin.

1100
00:58:29,800 --> 00:58:32,268
I stay in a stationary position.

1101
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:36,438
When the assholes come by,
I lick the assholes.

1102
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:41,270
And in one motion, my mother...
both pinkies up their assholes, as they come.

1103
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,914
It's pretty... It's pretty spectacular.

1104
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,791
And it's all about timing.

1105
00:58:46,520 --> 00:58:50,798
Like, on one level it's a joke about
scatological humour and show business.

1106
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:52,637
But on another level,

1107
00:58:52,680 --> 00:58:54,477
it's about a family,

1108
00:58:54,520 --> 00:58:57,671
it's about the hopes and dreams of that family...

1109
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,711
My brother has Down's syndrome.

1110
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,716
Did I say that?

1111
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:03,796
People think it's a setback, but really...

1112
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,398
it's a selling point.

1113
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:06,714
It's not a handicap.

1114
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,751
I don't wanna say it's a gift.

1115
00:59:08,800 --> 00:59:12,679
I mean, we think of it as a gift
just in terms of ticket sales, but I mean...

1116
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,870
we think of it as...

1117
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:18,595
showing the other beauties that God creates,

1118
00:59:18,640 --> 00:59:20,915
like the ones with the bigger foreheads,

1119
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,679
and the lower eyelids.

1120
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,314
<i>Did they ever ask you
to be on The Tonight Show?</i>

1121
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:27,873
Not The Tonight Show.

1122
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,388
But Joe Franklin loved the Aristocrats.

1123
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:34,558
He was like our rehearsal director
when Dad and my brother weren't there,

1124
00:59:34,600 --> 00:59:36,591
and my mother...

1125
00:59:37,640 --> 00:59:39,631
<i>... and my nana... weren't there.</i>

1126
00:59:42,040 --> 00:59:43,951
I was on his show.

1127
00:59:44,000 --> 00:59:45,991
He said it wasn't a taped show.

1128
00:59:46,040 --> 00:59:48,031
But...

1129
00:59:48,080 --> 00:59:50,071
we, like, did a show.

1130
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:55,471
<i>Like, in his apartment?</i>

1131
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,590
Yeah, it was his office.

1132
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,631
But he had a... a bed in it...

1133
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:04,439
like a couch that he called Uncle Joe's bed.

1134
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:08,075
For little people.
Cos a couch is like a bed for little people.

1135
01:00:08,120 --> 01:00:10,111
You know?

1136
01:00:16,120 --> 01:00:17,758
Joe Franklin raped me.

1137
01:00:21,600 --> 01:00:26,230
Comedians often feel like,
"I am this weird, twisted, strange person,

1138
01:00:26,280 --> 01:00:28,999
somewhere near the outer reaches
of the bell curve,

1139
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:31,076
trying somehow to package this

1140
01:00:31,120 --> 01:00:35,318
in a way that confers upon me
some kind of dignity and respect."

1141
01:00:35,360 --> 01:00:38,079
Maybe that's the reason
that this joke is so appealing.

1142
01:00:38,120 --> 01:00:42,432
I've played by their rules for a really long time.
I don't want to do it any more.

1143
01:00:42,480 --> 01:00:44,869
Will they prevent me
from doing a show with the Olsen twins?

1144
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,035
I think you're all skirting around this.

1145
01:00:48,080 --> 01:00:52,710
You should all be aristocrats.
The audience, all of us should be aristocrats.

1146
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:55,320
People are contracted
into this puritanical idea

1147
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:58,875
that we have to get married when we're young,
we can't fuck boys and fuck girls.

1148
01:00:58,920 --> 01:01:01,753
We can do it all. Starfish are bi.

1149
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:05,873
Have you seen a starfish eat out
another starfish? It takes for ever. They do it.

1150
01:01:05,920 --> 01:01:09,276
Close the comedy clubs and open up brothels,
bathhouses, glory holes.

1151
01:01:09,320 --> 01:01:13,279
This is what this country needs.
It needs a really tight orgasm.

1152
01:01:13,320 --> 01:01:15,072
I'm an actor. I was in a lot of TV shows.

1153
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:19,716
I went to this orgy once. I fucked all these people
and somebody whispered in my ear,

1154
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:21,751
"You were great on Friends."

1155
01:01:22,440 --> 01:01:25,876
But you're not going to have Mary Hart
talk about that with me.

1156
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:28,309
I want to take an approach to the joke
in my way.

1157
01:01:28,360 --> 01:01:29,918
I'm the agent and I'm pitching it.

1158
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:35,557
So this very athletic blond man
walks onto the stage in a leather Speedo.

1159
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:38,273
He has this slightly sadistic nature about him.

1160
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:43,030
He has this fine, fine baby hair
all over these very steely pectoral muscles.

1161
01:01:43,080 --> 01:01:45,469
He has like a treasure trail that goes down...

1162
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:48,114
to heavy, cut man-meat. An 11 x7 cock.

1163
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:49,559
He's horse-hung guy.

1164
01:01:49,600 --> 01:01:52,319
This chick walks up with a rocket body
and artificial rack.

1165
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:56,114
She looks like Carmen Electra, only better.
She starts gently rubbing her pussy.

1166
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,197
This submissive sissy boy comes out
and points at the dick and says,

1167
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:01,674
"I want that cock to bust my virgin ass."

1168
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,358
The chick straps on this dildo,

1169
01:02:03,400 --> 01:02:07,359
has this challenging, intense expression
on her face, and says, "Let me."

1170
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:10,073
She rubs him in a very spiritually-centred way.

1171
01:02:10,120 --> 01:02:13,032
Little sissy boy is obviously a demanding
pussy bottom.

1172
01:02:13,080 --> 01:02:15,071
He tilts his ass up.

1173
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:19,796
She starts eating his ass, giving him this
rim job royale, as they'd say in Pulp Fiction.

1174
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:23,799
The horse-hung dick is now going into
pussy boy's mouth. He's getting face-fucked.

1175
01:02:23,840 --> 01:02:26,559
The girl takes his cock in her pussy,
but what she...

1176
01:02:26,600 --> 01:02:28,716
and this is gonna be in the programme,

1177
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:33,231
that the girl has trained in that fine geisha way
where the pussy would contract,

1178
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,669
to make your vagina pull up on that cock.

1179
01:02:35,720 --> 01:02:39,759
When you are shooting, it is like yanking it.

1180
01:02:39,800 --> 01:02:42,712
I don't know if anyone's ever had that happen,
but it's wild.

1181
01:02:42,760 --> 01:02:45,877
She is taking a huge fucking horse flow.

1182
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:47,911
It's called the Massage-ocrats.

1183
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:53,599
This joke holds a mirror up to itself.

1184
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:59,275
The people who say the joke must contain shit -
don't invite them into your home.

1185
01:02:59,320 --> 01:03:03,632
The people who say it must involve bestiality -
don't let them near your dog.

1186
01:03:03,680 --> 01:03:05,716
This tells you a lot about a person, this joke.

1187
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:08,479
It's where your darkest place can go, you know.

1188
01:03:08,520 --> 01:03:11,830
In a way, this joke really isn't all that relevant.

1189
01:03:11,880 --> 01:03:14,075
Standards of "offensive" change over time.

1190
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:15,997
It's quite a tame joke now.

1191
01:03:16,040 --> 01:03:19,157
There's something quite charming about it,
which is weird.

1192
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,192
"I have got the perfect family act."
"Go ahead. Tell me."

1193
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:25,232
"The wife and I go out, we sing and dance,
we fuck each other,

1194
01:03:25,280 --> 01:03:27,555
we fuck the kids,
the kids fuck each other.

1195
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:31,195
The dog shits and pisses on all of us.
He looks up, jumps through a hoop."

1196
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,231
"What do you call the act?"
"The Aristocrats."

1197
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:36,431
The agent goes, "I already have an act like that."

1198
01:03:36,480 --> 01:03:38,357
That's what happened to show business.

1199
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:42,552
"Fuck the kids, fuck the dogs," doesn't matter.
Well, I've already seen that.

1200
01:03:42,600 --> 01:03:44,591
That's not really a joke any more.

1201
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:48,315
That's actually a really great idea
to pitch to a network.

1202
01:03:48,360 --> 01:03:52,797
I could walk into NBC tomorrow and say
I have a dysfunctional family idea.

1203
01:03:52,840 --> 01:03:55,434
So dysfunctional it defies description.

1204
01:03:55,480 --> 01:04:00,031
We have people fucking and sucking,
diddling like an 11-year-old cheerleader.

1205
01:04:00,080 --> 01:04:04,949
We can bring in people from the past.
They get those idiotic ads - Humphrey Bogart.

1206
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:09,278
Get your major world leaders from the past,
like Hitler, Mussolini, Genghis Khan.

1207
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:10,833
I just thought of that!

1208
01:04:10,880 --> 01:04:12,916
It's not a joke! This will go on TV.

1209
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:16,270
We blow Hitler, then in the next episode
we bite his dick off. Ha ha!

1210
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:19,392
See what happens to Hitler's dick.
Phenomenal!

1211
01:04:19,440 --> 01:04:23,399
It's a family act but it's a twist,
cos they're retarded.

1212
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:27,035
What they do is, they get in a pile
of dead nuns and they fuck each other,

1213
01:04:27,080 --> 01:04:30,709
then they have a big closing
and fist-fuck an autistic pre-teen.

1214
01:04:30,760 --> 01:04:33,320
The agent says, "Well, what do you call 'em?"

1215
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:35,351
And he says, "The Osbournes."

1216
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:41,958
A lot of what is already on TV now, they would
have the dog-fucking and the shit-eating on...

1217
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:45,675
- Friends.
- Not on Friends but on South Park.

1218
01:04:45,880 --> 01:04:47,996
- You guys want to hear a funny joke?
- No.

1219
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:50,470
This family walks into a talent agency.

1220
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:52,988
Mother, father, son, daughter and a little baby.

1221
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,838
The father says,
"Sir, our family has an amazing act."

1222
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:58,394
The agent says, "Family acts are too cutesy."

1223
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:02,433
The mother goes, "Sir, just give us two minutes.
We know you'll like our act."

1224
01:05:02,480 --> 01:05:05,472
The agent says,
"All right, you've got two minutes."

1225
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:09,035
Thrilling circus music starts
as the father spins his daughter round,

1226
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:11,753
- lifts her skirt and starts licking her asshole.
- What?!

1227
01:05:11,800 --> 01:05:15,839
Then the son lays down, opens his mouth, and
the mother squats down and shits all over him.

1228
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,359
- Dude!
- Hold on, hold on.

1229
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,870
The father grabs the baby,
takes off his diaper and sucks his cock,

1230
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:25,436
while the son, with shit in his mouth,
goes over and licks the baby's balls.

1231
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:28,836
Then they take the baby
and stuff it head-first into the mother's vagina.

1232
01:05:28,880 --> 01:05:30,871
- Just stop.
- Hold on.

1233
01:05:30,920 --> 01:05:34,151
They get the baby halfway in
so just its legs are sticking out.

1234
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:37,510
The son takes the shit out of his mouth
and rubs it all over everyone,

1235
01:05:37,560 --> 01:05:41,155
while the father sticks his cock
in the baby's asshole and fucks it,

1236
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,397
until he comes all over the baby,
the wife, son and daughter.

1237
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:46,954
- I don't want to...
- Will you hold on, please?

1238
01:05:47,000 --> 01:05:51,073
Then the father says, "And now for our
impersonation of the victims of 9/11."

1239
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:53,839
The family runs around
covered with shit, piss and come,

1240
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:56,599
going, "Ah! The building's coming down! Help!"

1241
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:59,837
The family runs back to the centre of the room
and goes, "Ta-da!"

1242
01:05:59,880 --> 01:06:02,713
The talent agent just sits there.
Finally, he says,

1243
01:06:02,760 --> 01:06:05,194
"That's a hell of an act. What do you call it?"

1244
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:07,629
The father says, "The Aristocrats."

1245
01:06:12,280 --> 01:06:13,872
I don't get it.

1246
01:06:15,040 --> 01:06:16,837
Neither do I.

1247
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:18,711
It's not transgressive any more.

1248
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:22,275
We're re-inventing the joke
by putting in stuff that's offensive now.

1249
01:06:22,320 --> 01:06:24,117
The world has changed.

1250
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,277
Shockability had gone to a whole other level.

1251
01:06:27,320 --> 01:06:29,595
People say, "Nigger, spic, dick, cunt."

1252
01:06:29,640 --> 01:06:31,995
You can say all that, people go...

1253
01:06:32,040 --> 01:06:34,508
When you're among comedians,
you have to push the envelope.

1254
01:06:34,560 --> 01:06:36,152
A comedian telling it to comedians?

1255
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,590
He'd probably do a more disgusting version
of it for his peers

1256
01:06:39,640 --> 01:06:43,553
than he would for his friends at the bar
from the old neighbourhood.

1257
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:47,229
It's like you're performing in front of your family,
yet there's no holds barred.

1258
01:06:47,280 --> 01:06:50,875
There's a level of appreciation
that will go along with it.

1259
01:06:50,920 --> 01:06:53,912
I dare you to tell that joke on stage
in front of anyone.

1260
01:06:53,960 --> 01:06:56,315
If you can make an audience laugh at that,
you are God.

1261
01:06:56,360 --> 01:07:00,512
I'm a writer at the New York Observer.
For five years, I've covered the Friar's roast.

1262
01:07:00,560 --> 01:07:04,599
This year I wrote about Gilbert Gottfried's
take on the Aristocrats.

1263
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,835
Gilbert Gottfried did it at the Hugh Hefner roast.

1264
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:08,916
It was the funniest fucking joke ever.

1265
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:13,033
This roast was happening
not even three weeks after September 11th,

1266
01:07:13,080 --> 01:07:16,675
so there was a big discussion
about what was right in terms of taste.

1267
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:19,712
There hadn't been any comedy in New York.
It was very fresh.

1268
01:07:19,760 --> 01:07:22,877
We were faced with having to put up a show,
put on tuxedos,

1269
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:25,388
get Hugh Hefner and his pussy posse
on a plane.

1270
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:27,237
It wasn't easy but we got him to do it.

1271
01:07:27,280 --> 01:07:31,432
To his credit, we raised half a million dollars
for charity, for 9/11 charities.

1272
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:33,277
People needed a laugh, to release.

1273
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:37,632
Everybody was pulling back.
Everybody was really being careful.

1274
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:39,033
Rob Schneider went on first.

1275
01:07:39,080 --> 01:07:41,833
He was doing great,
then a couple of jokes didn't work.

1276
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:46,556
I went up to the mike and I said, "Rob, hasn't
there been enough bombing in this city?"

1277
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:49,160
Here comes Gilbert and he just went for broke.

1278
01:07:49,200 --> 01:07:51,191
It was unbelievable.

1279
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:54,516
Gilbert Gottfried took the mike,
took the room over.

1280
01:07:54,560 --> 01:07:57,279
He said he was trying to get a direct flight
to Los Angeles.

1281
01:07:57,320 --> 01:08:01,438
He was nervous cos his plane had a connection
at the Empire State Building.

1282
01:08:01,480 --> 01:08:03,994
That was when the crowd turned.

1283
01:08:04,040 --> 01:08:07,999
<i>They started booing him.
A guy was shouting, "Too soon, too soon."</i>

1284
01:08:08,040 --> 01:08:09,871
<i>The crowd was murmuring and he said:</i>

1285
01:08:09,920 --> 01:08:12,115
OK. A man...

1286
01:08:14,160 --> 01:08:17,869
A talent agent is sitting in his office.

1287
01:08:18,800 --> 01:08:24,352
A family walks in: man woman,
their two kids, and their little dog.

1288
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:26,755
The agent goes,
"What kind of an act do you do?"

1289
01:08:26,800 --> 01:08:31,271
It was like he made a conscious decision,
"OK, I can't push the envelope of taste

1290
01:08:31,320 --> 01:08:36,235
in terms of what happened in September,
so I'll push it in a completely different direction."

1291
01:08:36,280 --> 01:08:40,114
It was arguably the dirtiest roast
the Friar's had ever done.

1292
01:08:40,160 --> 01:08:44,551
The father starts fucking his wife,
the wife starts jerking off the son,

1293
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:46,716
the son starts going down on the sister,

1294
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:49,638
the sister starts fingering the dog's asshole.

1295
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:52,990
He just grabbed them by the throat.
He just attacked.

1296
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:55,793
Then the son starts blowing his father.

1297
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,910
You want me to start at the beginning?

1298
01:08:59,720 --> 01:09:02,712
If you missed any portion, I'll repeat it.

1299
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:06,155
<i>There was this weird buzz that came.</i>

1300
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:11,399
The guys up on the dais were looking at each
other with this look of familiarity in their eyes.

1301
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:13,749
They were all saying,
"Where is he going to take this?"

1302
01:09:13,800 --> 01:09:17,190
Then the daughter starts licking out
the father's asshole.

1303
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:20,915
Then the father shits on the floor,
the mother shits on the floor.

1304
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,030
The dog pisses and shits on the floor.

1305
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:26,914
They all jump down into the shit and piss
and come

1306
01:09:26,960 --> 01:09:30,157
and they start fucking and sucking each other,

1307
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:32,475
and then they take a bow.

1308
01:09:34,720 --> 01:09:36,711
And the talent agent says...

1309
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,951
I'll wait till you're ready.

1310
01:09:43,560 --> 01:09:46,074
I'm sitting at a table
and the comics were on the floor.

1311
01:09:46,120 --> 01:09:48,793
They might have to clean this up for TV.

1312
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,914
<i>I was laughing cos he was going so big with it,</i>

1313
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:56,633
which I can't imagine Gilbert Gottfried doing.

1314
01:09:56,680 --> 01:10:01,549
It was probably one of the best single tellings
of a joke I've ever heard.

1315
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,431
Now, where was I? Oh, yes.

1316
01:10:03,480 --> 01:10:06,552
The son is licking out his father's asshole.

1317
01:10:08,880 --> 01:10:12,316
I almost died because I couldn't
catch my breath with laughing.

1318
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:15,079
They fuck and suck each other
and they take a bow.

1319
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:19,912
And the talent agent...
Did you miss any portion of this?

1320
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:23,589
The talent agent says,
"Well, that's an interesting act."

1321
01:10:23,640 --> 01:10:25,915
Which is kind of an understatement.

1322
01:10:25,960 --> 01:10:31,637
The laugh was so deep and cathartic
that people were coughing up pieces of lung.

1323
01:10:31,680 --> 01:10:36,196
It was amazing. A lot of people watching him,
or up on the dais, are all in comedy

1324
01:10:36,240 --> 01:10:40,074
and it was as if he had united everybody
in that one moment

1325
01:10:40,120 --> 01:10:44,796
because he told something that they all knew
and they all had some sort of handle on it.

1326
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:48,435
<i>He focused it and clearly impressed
a lot of people in the room.</i>

1327
01:10:48,480 --> 01:10:50,471
Now...

1328
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:54,399
<i>He pulled this thing out and did it so well,</i>

1329
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:56,431
<i>with such fearlessness.</i>

1330
01:10:56,480 --> 01:10:59,836
I hate to end this on a really sentimental note.

1331
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:03,873
There was a sound in the audience
that you really knew something was happening.

1332
01:11:03,920 --> 01:11:09,438
It was outside my grasp, and for anyone else
who wasn't a total comedy veteran.

1333
01:11:09,480 --> 01:11:11,436
Not a great joke.

1334
01:11:11,480 --> 01:11:16,429
On the other hand, hear Gilbert Gottfried
tell a joke like that, it's a Picasso.

1335
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:18,152
The joke I didn't care about any more.

1336
01:11:18,200 --> 01:11:19,952
I wanted to see how far he would take it,

1337
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,753
and when he would not stop saying
"fucking and sucking"...

1338
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,995
Watching him go through his apoplectic,

1339
01:11:25,040 --> 01:11:29,397
rhythmic, incantation of the whole thing
sort of takes over.

1340
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:33,433
The fact that he is saying these particular words
almost doesn't matter.

1341
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:35,550
He says, "What do you call yourself?"

1342
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,591
And they go, "The Aristocrats!"

1343
01:11:45,200 --> 01:11:47,191
It's just a joke.

1344
01:11:47,760 --> 01:11:48,829
Help!

1345
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:51,075
Is it as shocking as the first time you heard it?

1346
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:53,156
Don't touch me.

1347
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:56,715
- Is that the joke as you remember it?
- I didn't hear it that way.

1348
01:11:56,760 --> 01:11:58,398
This is so much worse.

1349
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,274
I'm already feeling like I didn't do it justice.

1350
01:12:05,320 --> 01:12:10,189
I had "fucking the daughter" in there
but I didn't colour it in with colourful adjectives.

1351
01:12:10,240 --> 01:12:11,468
"An arm like Popeye."

1352
01:12:11,520 --> 01:12:13,750
I didn't realise the bill that I was on.

1353
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:17,509
What's the most vile, offensive thing
you could add to top all that?

1354
01:12:17,560 --> 01:12:23,396
If a guy took some of the shit and smeared it
on his face and did a black-face routine.

1355
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:25,556
- Doing a minstrel act.
- That's good.

1356
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,670
Add race-baiting.

1357
01:12:27,720 --> 01:12:31,679
Sex any more? Who gives a shit?
The racial issue has replaced the sexual issue.

1358
01:12:31,720 --> 01:12:33,915
- I'm the agent and you're the client.
- OK.

1359
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:37,555
Are you a Jew agent,
you filthy, hook-nosed, thieving fuck?

1360
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:39,516
Yeah.

1361
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:45,317
He goes, "A Black guy comes on and starts
sucking my cock like it's a chicken neck bone.

1362
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:50,069
This Indian comes on - you know,
Slurpee Indian, not casino Indian...

1363
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:56,031
...sprinkles curry on everybody...

1364
01:12:57,520 --> 01:12:59,511
<i>... and starts stinking up the place.</i>

1365
01:12:59,560 --> 01:13:04,236
A spic comes on, steals everybody's wallet
and takes a shit on the stage.

1366
01:13:05,560 --> 01:13:10,236
The Black guy grabs a mop, sticks it up the gay
guy's ass and mops up the fucking floor."

1367
01:13:10,280 --> 01:13:13,750
The agent says,
"Holy shit, what do you guys call yourselves?"

1368
01:13:13,800 --> 01:13:15,791
The fag goes, "The Aristocrats."

1369
01:13:18,040 --> 01:13:20,349
One of the clichés people often go to is...

1370
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:22,436
Now, some people do this for shock value.

1371
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:26,075
Shock is just another uptown word for surprise.

1372
01:13:26,120 --> 01:13:30,193
Granted it has a different quality to it,
but a joke is about surprising someone.

1373
01:13:30,240 --> 01:13:32,356
Three women of colour go to this agent.

1374
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:34,391
He goes, "What do you do?"

1375
01:13:34,440 --> 01:13:39,639
"My sister plays the cello. She plays
Chopin's Third Movement in B Minor.

1376
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:44,435
I lay on a chaise longue nude,
reading sonnets from Shakespeare.

1377
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:48,678
My third sister paints a painting
very similar to Delacroix's The Girl."

1378
01:13:48,720 --> 01:13:50,756
He says, "Wow, what do you call this act?"

1379
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,995
She goes, "Oh, we're Nigger Cunts."

1380
01:13:53,040 --> 01:13:55,031
You can't say that.

1381
01:13:55,080 --> 01:13:57,116
The two worst words in the world.

1382
01:13:57,160 --> 01:14:00,391
I'm a great believer in context.
You can joke about anything.

1383
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:04,194
Funny is funny. If told with a funny bone,
anything's acceptable.

1384
01:14:04,240 --> 01:14:06,231
Let's have some fun.

1385
01:14:06,280 --> 01:14:10,796
After the tragic events of January 3rd, come on.

1386
01:14:12,560 --> 01:14:16,439
On January 3rd, I left my Visa
at the Four Seasons, it was like...

1387
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:19,472
I do like finding out where the line is drawn,

1388
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:23,308
deliberately crossing it and bringing
some of them with me across the line,

1389
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:25,157
and having them be happy that I did.

1390
01:14:25,200 --> 01:14:27,191
I like to take chances,

1391
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:29,310
because I just think that you should.

1392
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:31,749
That's what comedy is all about.

1393
01:14:32,160 --> 01:14:35,755
I pull up Mommy's dress,
and I put my wiener in her butt.

1394
01:14:35,800 --> 01:14:39,679
And I push it into her unwilling anus.

1395
01:14:39,720 --> 01:14:43,110
And I move my wiener back and forth
until stuff shoots out.

1396
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:46,072
So it's finally just a whole prolapsed rectum.

1397
01:14:46,120 --> 01:14:48,190
It looks like an ulcerated sea snake.

1398
01:14:48,240 --> 01:14:50,708
Remember when I took you to SeaWorld? Yeah.

1399
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:53,433
And all the stuff shoots onto her face.

1400
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:55,471
I stick my cock in her ass,

1401
01:14:55,520 --> 01:14:59,399
and it's like a shillelagh,
all knotted with boils and fibrous tumours.

1402
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,953
I'll show you a little bit later.

1403
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:03,833
The brother comes out.
He eats the stuff off her face.

1404
01:15:03,880 --> 01:15:06,599
With his bleeding anus splattering on the crowd.

1405
01:15:06,640 --> 01:15:10,315
We give the front row garbage bags.
Have you ever seen Gallagher?

1406
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,954
- Yeah, I didn't like it that much myself.

1407
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,116
They ate the poop off the floor.

1408
01:15:15,160 --> 01:15:17,037
And he says, "Ta-da!"

1409
01:15:17,080 --> 01:15:19,548
And the man says, "The Aristocrats."

1410
01:15:20,840 --> 01:15:22,910
And both of the men are probably Jews.

1411
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:29,915
There's still a joke out there
that maybe they shouldn't tell.

1412
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:31,791
Maybe they're taking a chance telling.

1413
01:15:31,840 --> 01:15:35,116
Maybe they get a little bit nervous
as they start the joke.

1414
01:15:35,160 --> 01:15:38,038
It means something,
even in today's day and age.

1415
01:15:38,080 --> 01:15:39,991
They just get a little murmur inside,

1416
01:15:40,040 --> 01:15:44,670
and I think that will be
what keeps a joke like this special.

1417
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:48,358
I never realised any of that stuff
was considered dirty.

1418
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,676
Before you guys got here,
I was eating a plate of my own shit.

1419
01:15:53,200 --> 01:15:56,909
Hey, Mel. Do you know this joke about...

1420
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,190
The punch line is "The Aristocrats."

1421
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:01,231
I totally do not get it.

1422
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:04,875
- You don't get the joke?
- Someone told it to me but I don't get it.

1423
01:16:04,920 --> 01:16:07,514
The whole family's having sex with each other.

1424
01:16:07,560 --> 01:16:10,154
- Is that aristocratic?
- It's more than that.

1425
01:16:10,200 --> 01:16:12,191
Um...

1426
01:16:12,880 --> 01:16:16,509
Yeah, I think it's best if we don't break it down.
Do you agree with that?

1427
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:26,031
<i>No, I don't want to tell the joke.</i>

1428
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:28,275
You've had way too many great people tell it.

1429
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:45,357
The Aristocrats!

1430
01:16:47,240 --> 01:16:48,878
That's great.

1431
01:16:50,360 --> 01:16:52,555
The best-Iooking ass in show business.

1432
01:16:55,600 --> 01:16:58,876
Don't ever ask me to do another favour for you.

1433
01:16:58,920 --> 01:17:01,434
I guarantee this will not wind up
on my demo tape.

1434
01:17:01,480 --> 01:17:03,869
I'm not gonna work for Disney ever again.

1435
01:17:03,920 --> 01:17:06,229
Thanks a lot, Paul Provenza.

1436
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:10,159
I once asked Dom Irrera, why does anal sex
play such a huge role in humour?

1437
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:12,668
He said, "I can't tell you but I can show you."

1438
01:17:19,960 --> 01:17:22,349
Sarah Silverman is a young lady to watch.

1439
01:17:22,400 --> 01:17:24,391
I'll keep an eye on her.

1440
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,317
<i>- You've never met her?
- No.</i>

1441
01:17:28,680 --> 01:17:30,671
Does everyone do this or not?

1442
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:32,597
All right. Fuck, shit, cunt.

1443
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:45,674
A man goes into a pub and another guy
hits him on the head with an iron bar.

1444
01:17:45,720 --> 01:17:47,517
He says, "Is that serious or a joke?"

1445
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:51,473
He says, "It's serious."
"Thank God. I can't stand jokes like that."

1446
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:57,471
Is any of this funny?

1447
01:17:57,520 --> 01:17:59,511
Don't pan to them. Stay on me.

1448
01:17:59,560 --> 01:18:03,599
Don't look at them.
There's gonna be problems. OK.

1449
01:18:19,560 --> 01:18:22,472
Brunch is gonna be up in Redford's thing. 2020.

1450
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:24,511
I'll try to be alive for it.

1451
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:34,558
It's not often you talk about cunts for 10 minutes
and somebody behind a camera goes,

1452
01:18:34,600 --> 01:18:36,875
"Perfect. That's exactly what we need."

1453
01:18:41,240 --> 01:18:43,834
A guy sees two priests having supper together.

1454
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:48,078
He says, "I didn't know whether to send them
a bottle of wine or a cub scout."

1455
01:19:02,200 --> 01:19:05,397
The dog's name is Peanuts and she is blind.

1456
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:07,431
She wasn't blind when we got her,

1457
01:19:07,480 --> 01:19:11,155
but we blinded her
just so she'd be a little bit more fun.

1458
01:19:20,920 --> 01:19:22,512
- Er...
That's good.

1459
01:19:22,560 --> 01:19:24,391
- Er...
- That's good.

1460
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,591
Is this thing on?

1461
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:40,714
Argh!

1462
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:54,874
To the other comedians:
I don't know what you're getting,

1463
01:19:54,920 --> 01:19:58,549
but they refused to pay me
and I'm really steamed. Steamed!

1464
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,872
And the agent says...

1465
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:15,071
What the fuck am I doing?

1466
01:20:25,600 --> 01:20:28,512
- Do other people get laughs out of this?
- I think so.

1467
01:20:29,280 --> 01:20:31,271
And he says, "The Aristocrats!"

1468
01:20:31,920 --> 01:20:36,550
Cos it's absolutely the wrong thing
to call an act like that.

1469
01:20:53,560 --> 01:20:55,551
Is it on?

1470
01:20:58,360 --> 01:21:00,157
You're not taping yet really, are you?

1471
01:21:00,720 --> 01:21:01,914
Goodbye!

1472
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:05,669
<i>- The mike!
- I forgot we had the mike on.</i>

1473
01:21:05,720 --> 01:21:07,312
Try this. Ball sacks.

1474
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:11,751
<i>I said ball sacks in front of a six-year-old girl.
They'll take my six-year-old away from me.</i>

1475
01:21:11,800 --> 01:21:14,553
Bye, Robert. Daddy loves you.

1476
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:21,390
I often sit here in my garden,
gazing into my Victorian reflecting ball, and...

1477
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,908
Darling, would you get me a cup of tea?

1478
01:21:23,960 --> 01:21:25,678
<i>Get it yourself.</i>

1479
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:31,512
I just want to thank you. It's so nice
to be part of this extraordinary experience.

1480
01:21:31,560 --> 01:21:33,437
A rabbi walks into a bar with a frog.

1481
01:21:33,480 --> 01:21:35,391
Bartender says, "Where did you get that?"

1482
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:38,159
The frog says,
"Brooklyn. There's hundred of 'em."

1483
01:21:38,200 --> 01:21:39,599
Good luck.

1484
01:21:43,960 --> 01:21:46,520
I feel like we're all connecting.

1485
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:52,830
<i>And now the world's oldest living vaudevillian
with the original Aristocratsjoke.</i>

1486
01:22:34,240 --> 01:22:36,231
<i>This way. This way.</i>

1487
01:23:00,360 --> 01:23:04,194
There are these two mountain goats and they...

1488
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:11,711
<i>Sir? Sir?</i>

1489
01:23:12,360 --> 01:23:14,351
<i>- Sir?
- Huh?</i>

1490
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:17,591
Thank you.

1491
01:24:29,960 --> 01:24:31,632
The Aristocrats.
