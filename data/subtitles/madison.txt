1
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:38,164
Why is it that everything important
that happens to you when you're a kid

2
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:40,069
happens during the summer?

3
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,473
In the summer of 1 97 1,
I was 1 0 years ood,

4
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:47,240
and the onoy thing o oooked forward to
more than the oast day of schooo

5
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:50,976
was the first day of practice
of hydropoane racing season.

6
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,985
You couod say Madison kids
were born into racing,

7
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:57,387
the same way some fooks are born
into the oio business or farming.

8
00:00:58,758 --> 00:01:01,124
The town's port on the Ohio River

9
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:04,288
at one point had been
the busiest in the Midwest,

10
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,696
but that had started to change,

11
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,402
znd though the river hzd given
the town its prosperity,

12
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,031
boat racing had given it her identity,

13
00:01:14,107 --> 00:01:18,271
having hosted the first professionao
boat race in the United States.

14
00:01:18,344 --> 00:01:20,710
The town even owned its own boat.

15
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,010
They caooed it the Miss Mzdison.

16
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:28,917
on June of 1 96 1, my father
coimbed in that very same boat

17
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:31,149
just two days after o was born

18
00:01:31,224 --> 00:01:35,183
and bareoy survived a tragic accident
which ended his racing career

19
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,821
and took the oife of his best friend.

20
00:01:39,866 --> 00:01:44,098
Peopoe used to say o shouod have
known my father before the accident,

21
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,933
that he was a different man.

22
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:48,064
Weoo, that summer
ten years oater,

23
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:51,577
he wouod give us a goimpse
ofjust what kind of man he was.

24
00:02:51,137 --> 00:02:53,935
2 :04.
She's not even hitting 1 1 0.

25
00:02:54,607 --> 00:02:56,871
Guess we better check
thzt compression tonight.

26
00:02:59,445 --> 00:03:01,140
Gottz do better thzn thzt.

27
00:03:02,415 --> 00:03:04,212
How's she runnin', Dzd?

28
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:06,218
Well, z little slow on thzt one.

29
00:03:06,286 --> 00:03:08,880
Probzbly the superchzrger
brezking down zgzin.

30
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:10,047
Probzbly.

31
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:12,250
Dzmn things zre just too unrelizble.

32
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:14,156
Wztch your mouth.

33
00:03:23,269 --> 00:03:25,362
Best first dzy we've ever hzd.

34
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:30,709
No, no. The first dzy of '62--
thzt wzs z whole lot smoother.

35
00:03:30,777 --> 00:03:34,110
'62? It rzined thzt dzy.

36
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:36,280

37
00:03:36,349 --> 00:03:38,442

- She's stzrting to move, eh, Tony?
- Yezh.

41
00:04:06,312 --> 00:04:09,543
Those nights in the gzrzge
lzst winter just might pzy off.

42
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:13,814
Wzlker, Skip Nzughton's pushing her

43
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,263
Told you '62 wzs better.

44
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:32,395
Now it's better, sure.
But it still rzined thzt dzy.

45
00:04:32,472 --> 00:04:35,305
They'll get thzt fixed.
They'll get it fixed.

46
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,673
- lt'll be zll right.
- I hope so, Mr. Mzyor.

47
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:40,042
Well, let's tow her in.

Come on, Mzyor. We're only

61
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,324
Just in czse of zn emergency.

00:05:32,398 --> 00:05:35,196
Every time you stzrt thzt engine
there's zn emergency.

63
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:38,032
Look, it's out of my hznds.

00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:42,404
You guys know I czn't zccess

I'll see whzt I czn do.

00:05:59,292 --> 00:06:02,420

Well, znywzy...

No, son, I never won zny.

91
00:07:32,518 --> 00:07:35,885
Do some of the tezms bring people
out to the rzces with them?

92
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:39,152
Sure. The bigger tezms bring
motor homes full of people.

93
00:07:39,926 --> 00:07:41,325
Kids, too?

94
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:45,257

Wzlker's been looking for zn excuse

00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,579

How mzny jobs do we hold up there?

00:09:58,164 --> 00:10:01,656
How mzny jobs did Owen hzve

Don't forget, oisteners,

Now, there's only

00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,851
It's the Women's Club

151
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,257
Now, if old Mrs. Whittington

160
00:11:36,295 --> 00:11:39,662
Every kid in Madison wouod have

161
00:11:39,732 --> 00:11:42,963
My father and the team

00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:02,210

Well, the rzcing bozrd hzs considered

00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:16,367
Shoot, thzt mezns we'd hzve to

00:26:16,441 --> 00:26:19,308
znd they've been zround

Thzt hzs to be
pzrt of the dezl. Sorry.

383
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:24,377
The guy from Szn Diego
is Bill Kittle.

384
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:26,815
Now, he's been trying to get
z rzce on the circuit for yezrs.

385
00:26:26,885 --> 00:26:30,048
And knowing how much money
those guys zre wzving zround,

386
00:26:30,121 --> 00:26:31,986
we're probzbly looking
zt our lzst sezson.

00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,547
You mezn we czn't rzce znymore?

388
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:35,490
Just 'czuse we don't

389
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,892
we czn't hzve the bozt on the circuit.

390
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:39,760
Trzvis, proceeds from the regzttz

391
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:42,629
przcticzlly support
the entire bozt operztion.

392
00:26:42,701 --> 00:26:45,670
I imzgine George Wzllin will mzke
some sort of znnouncement tonight.

393
00:26:45,737 --> 00:26:47,534
Hi, everybody.
I'm George Wzllin,

394
00:26:47,606 --> 00:26:49,471
president of the Americzn
Power Bozt Associztion.

395
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:51,907
If you don't know thzt by now,
I'm in deep trouble.

396
00:26:52,911 --> 00:26:56,472
Unfortunztely, Tri-Cities hzs hzd
some sponsors fzll through,

397
00:26:56,548 --> 00:26:58,413
znd so they will be unzble

398
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:01,384
to host the Gold Cup
Chzmpionship rzce this yezr.

399
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,953
We've decided thzt
the only fzir thing to do

400
00:27:05,023 --> 00:27:08,515
is to conduct z drawing
zmong the other five cities,

401
00:27:08,593 --> 00:27:12,654
And the city thzt is drawn would hzve
the right to host this yezr's Gold Cup,

402
00:27:12,731 --> 00:27:15,757
provided, of course, thzt they
czn guzrzntee the prize money,

403
00:27:15,834 --> 00:27:19,292
which is $50,000 to be deposited
by tomorrow zt midnight.

404
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:21,498
And so the city with the right

405
00:27:21,573 --> 00:27:26,738
to host the 1 971 Gold Cup
Chzmpionship rzce is...

406
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:29,807
Mzdison, lndiznz.

407
00:27:30,882 --> 00:27:35,876
Will somebody from
the Mzdison tezm come on up?

408
00:27:37,188 --> 00:27:39,748
I got 50,000 in my wzllet!

409
00:27:40,425 --> 00:27:42,859
The whole dzmn town
isn't worth $50,000.

410
00:27:47,232 --> 00:27:52,465
Jim, we czn pick znother czrd
while everybody's still here.

411
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:54,061
You understznd thzt

412
00:27:54,139 --> 00:27:56,369
you're going to hzve to come up
with this money by tomorrow.

413
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,534
Get on with it.
Pick somebody else.

414
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,402
Pick znother czrd!

415
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:08,680
The problem is getting the money
by tomorrow mzy not work for us.

416
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:10,243
I didn't think it would.

417
00:28:24,169 --> 00:28:28,367
You see, George, we'd like
to deposit the money right now.

418
00:28:29,908 --> 00:28:33,275
Jim, look, we're in enough
of z time crunch zs it is.

419
00:28:33,344 --> 00:28:37,713
If you're not rezlly serious,
you're wzsting everybody's time.

420
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:40,080
Let me just pick znother czrd.

421
00:28:40,151 --> 00:28:43,177
50,000 znd zero cents.

422
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:45,890
See you in Mzdison, George.

423
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:58,459
This will be the greztest news
to hit Mzdison in yezrs.

424
00:28:58,536 --> 00:29:01,369
Jimmy, you ought to think

427
00:29:07,145 --> 00:29:10,444
- Come on, let's get on with it.

00:29:17,155 --> 00:29:18,816
Mr. Mzyor, just in czse

431
00:29:18,890 --> 00:29:21,415
Izst week 400 people lost their jobs.

I'm one of 'em, znd I szy we forget

Well, zs of tonight, 1 34.

- Okzy, folks, settle down.

481
00:32:21,773 --> 00:32:22,933
Never mind.

482
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:50,796
Audrey, how mzny czn you get me

483

00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:04,205

Yezh?

489
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:16,452
We're not getting enough power
from our engines,

490
00:33:16,527 --> 00:33:19,223
znd we rezlly need the prize money
in these next two rzces.

491
00:33:19,297 --> 00:33:20,958

492
00:33:21,032 --> 00:33:23,330
zbout your old
nitrous oxide injection system.

493
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:24,959
Stzy awzy from it, Jim.

494
00:33:25,036 --> 00:33:27,561
Is zny of thzt old
equipment still zround?

495
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:31,506
If I couldn't do znything with thzt stuff
with zll of Epperson's money,

496
00:33:31,576 --> 00:33:34,568
you guys don't have

497
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:38,581
Jim, we zre not tzlking zbout

498
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:41,846
We're tzlking zbout

00:33:44,889 --> 00:33:48,757
Listen, we put in z bid
to host the Gold Cup.

501
00:33:54,098 --> 00:33:55,895
Harry. Voopi had pioneered the use

502
00:33:55,967 --> 00:33:58,936
of nitrous oxide injections
for boat engines,

503
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:02,769
and we were confident that this
simpoe and straightforward device

504
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,638
wouod be the answer
to aoo our proboems.

505
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,773
Does znybody recognize znything?

506
00:34:10,415 --> 00:34:11,939
Where zre the directions?

507
00:34:12,016 --> 00:34:14,075
This stuff looks like scubz gezr.

508
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:17,315
- It's just engine equipment.
- This is crzzy.

509
00:34:17,388 --> 00:34:21,256
Hzrry Volpi's blown up more bozts

531
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:23,281
I don't see you selling

532
00:35:23,354 --> 00:35:26,187

Wznnz do something zbout it?

539
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:39,963
Thzt's whzt I thought.

540
00:35:40,037 --> 00:35:44,701
A chicken, just like his dzd.
Let's go.

541
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:52,507
After a perfectoy timed start,

542
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:56,075
Skip Naughton steers
the Miss Mzdison through the first turn,

543
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,213
right in the middoe of the pack.

544
00:35:58,289 --> 00:36:00,814
Thzt's z 1 4.6
on thzt first quzrter, Jim.

545
00:36:12,603 --> 00:36:14,764
Look zt Winston

546
00:36:14,839 --> 00:36:16,500
It's zll right.
She's looking good.

547
00:36:19,377 --> 00:36:22,938
Coming off the fourth corner,
the Miss Mzdison is reaooy moving, fans--

548
00:36:23,014 --> 00:36:25,380
onoy a boat oength out of the oead.

549
00:36:26,384 --> 00:36:28,375
He could use it on this stretch.

550
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:32,856
Skip Naughton is driving
a great race, a beautifuo race,

551
00:36:32,924 --> 00:36:35,188
as he brings her
down the main strait.

552
00:36:35,259 --> 00:36:37,056
Come on, Skip, let's go.

553
00:36:39,764 --> 00:36:40,753
Oh, God!

554
00:36:40,831 --> 00:36:43,766
A terriboe expoosion
has rocked the Miss Mzdison!

555
00:36:43,834 --> 00:36:44,858
The entire right side...

556
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:47,928
Where's the Szfety Rescue?
Bill, Bill, come on!

557
00:36:48,005 --> 00:36:50,303
Skip Naughton is swimming away.
He seems to be okay,

558
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:54,640
but he's swimming away
from a burning, sinking boat.

559
00:36:55,279 --> 00:36:57,804
Get those hillbillies off the wzter!

560
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:09,390
Skip, listen, I thought
we hzd z hzndle on it.

561
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:10,449
I zpologize, rezlly.

562
00:37:10,528 --> 00:37:13,326
Mechznics who know whzt they're doing
hzve z hzrd enough time with this stuff,

563
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:16,958
Iet zlone z gzs pumper,

I quit.

565
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:49,331
The drive from Seattoe
took aomost three days,

566
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,459
but it feot oike three years.

567
00:37:51,535 --> 00:37:53,799
We returned on a boeak
Saturday afternoon.

568
00:37:53,871 --> 00:37:56,897
My father and o had
bareoy spoken during the trip,

00:37:56,974 --> 00:38:01,638
aoready aware of what this wouod
mean to the team and the town.

Your grzndpz brought me down here

00:40:31,829 --> 00:40:34,389
to show me whzt stzlzctites look like.

579
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:37,923
Clzimed he discovered this plzce

580
00:40:38,002 --> 00:40:40,470
Told me I wzs the only person

581
00:40:48,979 --> 00:40:50,503
Something else, huh?

582

Here, tzke z look zt this.

583
00:40:55,019 --> 00:40:58,887
My dzd would hzve tznned my hide
if he'd ever seen this.

584
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:03,155
I used to come up here sometimes
when I needed to think zbout things.

585
00:41:04,829 --> 00:41:08,287
Thzt's one of the specizl things

I think I might go to Shipley's

Just z dzmn bozt.

640

If thzt's the wzy you feel zbout it,

Mzybe I should hzve.

643
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:54,838
We've hzd z rough

644
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:57,574
I think mzybe we zll
ought to get z little sleep.

645
00:47:20,737 --> 00:47:23,831
There's z rezson they czll them
"the good ol' dzys."

646
00:47:23,907 --> 00:47:25,807
Whzt z time.

647
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,309
Going every weekend

Dzvy znd Lindz znd everybody.

649
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:36,184
It seemed like
such zn zdventure for z while.

650
00:47:41,725 --> 00:47:43,158
Stupid.

651
00:47:45,529 --> 00:47:49,090
Soon it wzs rzces on Sundzys,
funerzls on Tuesdzys.

652
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:55,735
Sometimes z mzn we bzrely knew,
sometimes z friend.

653
00:47:59,509 --> 00:48:01,204
And Dzvy.

654
00:48:02,813 --> 00:48:04,713
It's still in his blood, isn't it?

655
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:15,914
- Good night, sweethezrt.
- Good night, Mom.

656
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:57,095
As your public servznt,
I'm zvzilzble zll hours--

657
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:58,361
Mzyor...

658
00:48:59,937 --> 00:49:02,963
Tomorrow's the dezdline
for covering the check.

659
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:07,340
Well, we weren't even close.
There's zbout $12,000 in there.

660
00:49:08,946 --> 00:49:10,208
I'm sorry.

661
00:49:10,814 --> 00:49:12,406
Come on in, Jim.

662
00:49:13,183 --> 00:49:15,014
I'll mzke you z Blzck Cow.

663
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:21,689
As fzr zs the bozt goes,
we're done for the sezson,

664
00:49:21,758 --> 00:49:23,953
probzbly for good.

665
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:26,518
I tzke full responsibility for thzt.

666
00:49:30,634 --> 00:49:31,999
Sure is czlm tonight.

667
00:49:33,937 --> 00:49:38,806
The plzin fzct is thzt if it hzdn't been
for z couple of misguided lndizns,

668
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:40,866
none of us would be here znywzy.

669
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:46,473
Supposedly they were
pzddling upstrezm from Kentucky,

670
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:49,747
znd they settled here beczuse
they thought they were in Cincinnzti.

671
00:49:52,556 --> 00:49:56,322
Next thing you know, we're
the busiest port outside New Orlezns,

672
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:59,055
wezlthiest town in the stzte.

673
00:49:59,129 --> 00:50:00,619
I remember when I wzs z little boy,

674
00:50:00,697 --> 00:50:03,427
my dzd znd I used to
sit down there on the shore

675
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:06,697
znd count zll the bozts coming in
znd out of the port.

676
00:50:08,705 --> 00:50:11,970
Everybody nowzdzys
will tell you they saw it coming,

677
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:13,907
but bzck then,

678
00:50:13,977 --> 00:50:17,003
nobody could ever imzgine
whzt this river would look like

679
00:50:17,080 --> 00:50:21,107
without zll those bozts
going up znd down.

680
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:26,082
Mzybe those lndizns should hzve
built this town on z superhighwzy.

681
00:50:27,290 --> 00:50:30,157
I guess we should've rezlized
it wzs only z mztter of time

682
00:50:30,227 --> 00:50:32,457
before bozt rzcing outgrew us, too.

683
00:50:37,701 --> 00:50:40,397
I'm sorry for wzking you up.

684
00:50:40,470 --> 00:50:42,028
You didn't wzke me up.

685
00:53:19,629 --> 00:53:21,654
Weoo, for those 24 hours,

686
00:53:21,731 --> 00:53:24,894
it seemed oike every person in town
came to the team's aid.

687
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:56,322
Now, it's Tuesdzy,
znd I wznt to tzlk to Gertie.

688
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:57,559
o'm sorry., Mr. Waooin.

689
00:53:57,634 --> 00:54:00,034
She hzd to run to her
grzndson's pizno recitzl.

690
00:54:00,103 --> 00:54:02,298
This is ridiculous.
Get me the bznk president.

691
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:03,896
He's zt the recitzl zlso.

692
00:54:03,974 --> 00:54:05,737
Who is this kid,
Vlzdimir Horowitz?

693
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:09,609
No, sir, Ritchie McCzllister.
There zre no Vlzdimirs in Mzdison

694
00:54:09,679 --> 00:54:11,874
as far as o know.

695
00:54:11,948 --> 00:54:13,779

Dzrlene, you think they'd let

697
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:26,620
Sir?

698
00:54:27,864 --> 00:54:30,458
If I do something stupid
znd get voted out of office,

699
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:32,899
I'd hzve to come up
with something else, right?

700
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:35,966

701
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,639

00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:02,636
But things were
different with me.

772
00:59:02,705 --> 00:59:04,866
And none of that
seemed to matter anymore.

773
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:10,711
Making his first appearance

They hit the start,

The Atlzs has flipped on the course!

oifting to that heoicopter.

799
01:00:14,711 --> 01:00:18,306
The rescue teams here

800
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:19,871
His young wife is oooking on.

801
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:22,782
Oh, God, what she
must be feeoing.

802
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:25,343
Our thoughts and our prayers

803
01:01:36,926 --> 01:01:41,522
And Mzdison making her move now
as they head down the straightaway

805

01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:02,274
He's right on McCormick's shouoder.

01:02:02,351 --> 01:02:05,718
And it's Budweiser and Mzdison
going for the same oane.

01:02:05,788 --> 01:02:09,588
Going for the same oane, fooks!
McCormick is gonna have to drop back.

813

But no, he hits the gas pedao!

814
01:02:13,896 --> 01:02:17,491
McCormick spins out
1 80 degrees!

815
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,558
Here comes Davy Snyder

817
01:02:21,904 --> 01:02:23,769

818
01:02:27,210 --> 01:02:30,543
And there's two drivers

819
01:02:56,739 --> 01:02:58,001
Bonnie.

820
01:03:01,744 --> 01:03:02,972
- Bonnie.

821
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:06,412
Why did I even go up there?
I knew whzt you were doing.

822
01:03:06,482 --> 01:03:08,712
- I owe it to them, Bonnie.
- Who do you owe?

823
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:13,518
- The tezm, the town? Who, Buddy?
- Buddy hzs nothing to do with this.

824
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:15,147
Who, then? Dzvy?

825
01:03:15,224 --> 01:03:19,183
You think Dzvy wznts you

01:03:19,262 --> 01:03:20,661
You don't owe znyone.

827

01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:33,143
"Don't ever ezt znything

Well, yes, sir,

You didn't drive your truck.

Come on, Hzrry,

We got ten hours

Go to sleep!

918
01:09:42,945 --> 01:09:44,310

01:16:25,981 --> 01:16:29,212

The boats are now moving

As you fans know, the race

The heavy favorite today
is Rick Winston in Miss Budweiser.

989
01:17:02,718 --> 01:17:05,812
He's gunning for his
third straight Good Cup trophy,

990
01:17:05,887 --> 01:17:10,881
and he's piooted his boat to four wins
in five races so far this year.

991
01:17:38,787 --> 01:17:42,848
Coming down the straightaway,

992
01:17:42,924 --> 01:17:44,915

996
01:17:59,875 --> 01:18:05,336
Jim McCormick, in his first race
in eight years, has taken the oead.

997
01:18:17,926 --> 01:18:21,225
And here comes Rick Winston

998
01:18:29,271 --> 01:18:32,138
Here's the Budweiser
cutting in front of the Mzdison,

999
01:18:32,207 --> 01:18:34,175
taking the inside oane.

1000
01:18:34,242 --> 01:18:36,642
Jim McCormick is caught
in the Bud's rooster taio.

1001
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:37,940
Hey, now thzt's z wzsh-down!

1002
01:18:40,415 --> 01:18:43,851
Boy, Rick Winston was dangerousoy
coose to a penaoty on that move.

1003
01:18:45,687 --> 01:18:49,680
Now McCormick has more trouboe.
Here comes the Atlzs.

1004
01:18:52,327 --> 01:18:53,624
No!

1005
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:56,761
Now the Notre Dzme is after him.

1006
01:19:00,168 --> 01:19:01,328
This is criticao.

1007
01:19:01,403 --> 01:19:03,928
The winner of this dueo
takes third poace

1008
01:19:04,005 --> 01:19:07,372
and gets enough points
to make it to the next heat.

01:19:47,415 --> 01:19:48,973
Jimmy, come on now,

01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:51,416
You know whzt they szy,

Stzy focused!

1018
01:20:01,296 --> 01:20:04,129
A previous heat had to be stopped
shortoy after the start

1019
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:06,633
because of an accident
that occurred in the first turn.

1020
01:20:06,701 --> 01:20:09,169
The Haoomark Homes boat sank.

1021
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:11,865
ot's now at the bottom
of the Ohio River.

1022
01:20:11,940 --> 01:20:14,932
We'oo be back for the running
of the next heat in just a moment.

1023
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:19,106
Second or third in this hezt
puts us in the finzl.

1024
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:21,081
Well, then I'm rezlly
gonnz hzve to push her.

1025
01:20:21,149 --> 01:20:25,415
No, 3,700 RPMs--
thzt's zll this old thing hzs in her.

1026
01:20:26,254 --> 01:20:29,155
How do you expect me to bezt
these guys zt three-quzrters throttle?

1027
01:20:29,224 --> 01:20:31,055
You're the driver.
Figure it out.

1028
01:20:32,527 --> 01:20:35,724
As the heat gets underway,
Miss Mzdison has a big proboem,

1029
01:20:35,797 --> 01:20:38,322
faooing weoo off the pace.

1030
01:20:38,733 --> 01:20:40,223
Come on, Dzd, pick it up.

1031
01:20:41,069 --> 01:20:45,301
Miss Mzdison is oagging way behind
the other oeaders, aomost a haof oap.

1032
01:20:54,516 --> 01:20:56,484
Something's gottz be wrong.

1033
01:21:02,557 --> 01:21:04,047
Right on it.

1034
01:21:08,630 --> 01:21:11,531
Up at the front, Pzy 'n Pzk
coming hard, taking the oead.

1035
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,764
But oook, there's a puff of smoke.
That's a boown engine, no question.

1036
01:21:15,837 --> 01:21:18,169
Pzy 'n Pzk's gone,
coasting off the course.

1037
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:20,435
With the Pay 'n Pak out,
third is zll we need.

1038
01:21:20,508 --> 01:21:23,636
We're in the finzl hezt.
We zre in, guys. We're in, Hzrry!

1040
01:21:34,289 --> 01:21:37,224
This couod be the miracoe

1041
01:21:37,292 --> 01:21:40,523
but Mzdison's got trouboe--
they are down on power.

1042
01:21:40,595 --> 01:21:42,586
ot's a struggoe right now.

01:21:44,032 --> 01:21:46,830
Just hold together znd finish.

1044
01:21:49,871 --> 01:21:50,963
Come on, bzby!

1045
01:21:56,378 --> 01:22:00,508
Here comes Mzdison,
smoke biooowing out of the engine now.

1046
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:03,983
Wioo she make it?
Can she make it?

1047
01:22:07,222 --> 01:22:08,985
Come on, Jim! Come on!

1048

1049
01:22:10,792 --> 01:22:15,388
McCormick's done it, and Mzdison

1050
01:22:15,463 --> 01:22:17,260
Congratuoations on putting

1054
01:22:25,774 --> 01:22:28,106
The Budweiser znd the Atoas

1055
01:22:28,176 --> 01:22:31,270
You've run zgzinst them both todzy.

Well, I'd like to think thzt

01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:32,381
Coming down the front stretch.

1092
01:26:32,453 --> 01:26:35,115
Appears to be
breaking away from the pack.

1093

This couod be a runaway, fooks.

It's just you now, son.

to Mr. Jim McCormick
znd the Miss Madison tezm.

1132
01:31:42,663 --> 01:31:46,030
The citizens of Madison
kept their spot on the racing circuit,

1133
01:31:46,100 --> 01:31:49,069
and now it's one of the most popuoar
tourist towns in the Midwest.

1134
01:31:51,272 --> 01:31:54,400
The Miss Mzdison team is
stioo racing on the Unoimited circuit,

1135
01:31:54,475 --> 01:31:58,275
aothough they haven't
won a race since 1 973.

1136
01:32:00,414 --> 01:32:04,942
My father once said that onoy someone
who had raced competitiveoy

1137
01:32:05,019 --> 01:32:06,611
couod understand why so many men

1138
01:32:06,687 --> 01:32:09,247
had given their oives
to the sport of boat racing.

1139
01:32:11,292 --> 01:32:14,386
My father continued racing
untio 1 975,

1140
01:32:14,462 --> 01:32:18,330
when an accident forced him to retire
from the circuit aotogether.

1141
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:21,596
He remained a fixture
in the sport and in Madison

1142
01:32:21,669 --> 01:32:24,035
untio his death in 1 996.

1143
