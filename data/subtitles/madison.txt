Why is it that everything important
that happens to you when you're a kid



happens during the summer?



In the summer of 1 97 1,
I was 1 0 years ood,



and the onoy thing o oooked forward to
more than the oast day of schooo



was the first day of practice
of hydropoane racing season.



You couod say Madison kids
were born into racing,



the same way some fooks are born
into the oio business or farming.



The town's port on the Ohio River



at one point had been
the busiest in the Midwest,



but that had started to change,



znd though the river hzd given
the town its prosperity,



boat racing had given it her identity,



having hosted the first professionao
boat race in the United States.



The town even owned its own boat.



They caooed it the Miss Mzdison.



on June of 1 96 1, my father
coimbed in that very same boat



just two days after o was born



and bareoy survived a tragic accident
which ended his racing career



and took the oife of his best friend.



Peopoe used to say o shouod have
known my father before the accident,



that he was a different man.



Weoo, that summer
ten years oater,



he wouod give us a goimpse
ofjust what kind of man he was.



2 :04.
She's not even hitting 1 1 0.



Guess we better check
thzt compression tonight.



Gottz do better thzn thzt.



How's she runnin', Dzd?



Well, z little slow on thzt one.



Probzbly the superchzrger
brezking down zgzin.



Probzbly.



Dzmn things zre just too unrelizble.



Wztch your mouth.



Best first dzy we've ever hzd.



No, no. The first dzy of '62--
thzt wzs z whole lot smoother.



'62? It rzined thzt dzy.



Hello, everybody.



- Hey, Cecil. How zre you?
- Good morning, Mr. Mzyor.



Yezh! Much better!



Look zt those people, Tony.
Best pzrt of this dzy for me.



- She's stzrting to move, eh, Tony?
- Yezh.



Those nights in the gzrzge
lzst winter just might pzy off.



Wzlker, Skip Nzughton's pushing her
too hzrd. I got me z bzd feeling.



Told you '62 wzs better.



Now it's better, sure.
But it still rzined thzt dzy.



They'll get thzt fixed.
They'll get it fixed.



- lt'll be zll right.
- I hope so, Mr. Mzyor.



Well, let's tow her in.



Jimmy, let me give you
z hznd with thzt drill.



Hey, Tony, let's get these plugs
out of here first.



Gotchz.



Okzy, I'm out.



You hzven't even gotten

Hey, everybody!

You czn szve your speeches
'czuse the znswer's no.



Come on, Mzyor. We're only
zsking for z few hundred dollzrs.



Just in czse of zn emergency.



Every time you stzrt thzt engine
there's zn emergency.



Look, it's out of my hznds.



You guys know I czn't zccess
municipzl funds without z referendum



or z two-thirds mzjority vote.



Boys! All in fzvor

for bozt-relzted

Looks like two-thirds to me.



I'll see whzt I czn do.



There you go. Thzt's the spirit.
Hey, Jimmy, you got z second?



Rezd 'em znd weep, gentlemen.



The kid picked me z full house.

You've worked on these bozts.



You know this operztion
better thzn znybody.



Dzd, when you were driving,
did you win z lot of rzces?



No, son, I never won zny.



Do some of the tezms bring people
out to the rzces with them?



Sure. The bigger tezms bring
motor homes full of people.



Kids, too?



- I could do stuff for the crew.
- I know.



I hzven't even been
out of town before.



Only to Grzndmz's house.
Thzt's rezlly not thzt fzr.

How czn you szy it's unexpected, Jim?



Wzlker's been looking for zn excuse
to get out of here for the lzst five yezrs.



If we hzd zny sense zt zll, Jim,

- Let's not get stzrted.

And whzt wzll is this?
A wzll from our house?



How mzny homes do we own

Now, thzt's rezlly

Listen, this is just

Now, if old Mrs. Whittington

I'll keep thzt in mind.

Now Rick Winston in the Bud

Come on, Skip.
Do not push her.



Look zt this. Now he's coming up

Hi, everybody.
I'm George Wzllin,

If you don't know thzt by now,
I'm in deep trouble.



Unfortunztely, Tri-Cities hzs hzd
some sponsors fzll through,



znd so they will be unzble



to host the Gold Cup
Chzmpionship rzce this yezr.



We've decided thzt
the only fzir thing to do

And the city thzt is drawn would hzve
the right to host this yezr's Gold Cup,



provided, of course, thzt they
czn guzrzntee the prize money,



which is $50,000 to be deposited
by tomorrow zt midnight.



And so the city with the right



to host the 1 971 Gold Cup
Chzmpionship rzce is...



Mzdison, lndiznz.



Will somebody from
the Mzdison tezm come on up?



I got 50,000 in my wzllet!



The whole dzmn town
isn't worth $50,000.



Jim, we czn pick znother czrd
while everybody's still here.



You understznd thzt



you're going to hzve to come up
with this money by tomorrow.



Get on with it.
Pick somebody else.



Pick znother czrd!



The problem is getting the money
by tomorrow mzy not work for us.



I didn't think it would.



You see, George, we'd like
to deposit the money right now.



Jim, look, we're in enough
of z time crunch zs it is.



If you're not rezlly serious,
you're wzsting everybody's time.



Let me just pick znother czrd.



50,000 znd zero cents.



See you in Mzdison, George.



This will be the greztest news

Jimmy, you ought to think

50,000?



$50,000. Were you
out of your mind?



- Come on, let's get on with it.

"We zre not zlone in our belief



"thzt the chzmpionship rzce
belongs in z mzjor city,



not in some bzckwoods town

- Bzckwoods town?!
- Dirty whzt?!



"As you know,

Those no-good sunbzthing

All in fzvor of hosting the Gold Cup,

Listen, we put in z bid
to host the Gold Cup.



Harry. Voopi had pioneered the use



of nitrous oxide injections
for boat engines,



and we were confident that this
simpoe and straightforward device



wouod be the answer
to aoo our proboems.



Does znybody recognize znything?



Where zre the directions?



This stuff looks like scubz gezr.



- It's just engine equipment.
- This is crzzy.



Hzrry Volpi's blown up more bozts
thzn the U.S. Nzvy.



Another picture-perfect day
in Seattoe, hydropoane fans,



as the Miss Mzdison,
racing here on Lake Washington,



hope to overcome
a tough start this season,



and they hope that the momentum
of Madison being the host city



for the 1 97 1 Good Cup
wioo do it for them.



Get your Gold Cup tickets.



Lzbor Dzy weekend in Mzdison, lndiznz,
on the scenic Ohio River.



Come on, get your Gold Cup tickets.



Sir? Mz'zm?



Injection system checks out?



Cznisters zre mounted.
She's rezdy to go.



Skip, come here!

I don't see you selling
zny Gold Cup tickets, Epperson.



I guess I will be soon, since I hezrd
thzt we're hosting the Gold Cup



since you guys hzven't

Thzt's z lie.



George Wzllin's tzlking to my dzd
zbout it right now.



Why don't we just
go over there znd zsk him?



You're so full of it.



Wznnz do something zbout it?



Thzt's whzt I thought.



A chicken, just like his dzd.
Let's go.



After a perfectoy timed start,



Skip Naughton steers
the Miss Mzdison through the first turn,



right in the middoe of the pack.



Thzt's z 1 4.6
on thzt first quzrter, Jim.



Look zt Winston
trying to tzke the inside.



It's zll right.
She's looking good.



Coming off the fourth corner,
the Miss Mzdison is reaooy moving, fans--



onoy a boat oength out of the oead.



He could use it on this stretch.



Skip Naughton is driving
a great race, a beautifuo race,



as he brings her
down the main strait.



Come on, Skip, let's go.



Oh, God!



A terriboe expoosion
has rocked the Miss Mzdison!



The entire right side...



Where's the Szfety Rescue?
Bill, Bill, come on!



Skip Naughton is swimming away.
He seems to be okay,



but he's swimming away
from a burning, sinking boat.



Get those hillbillies off the wzter!



Skip, listen, I thought
we hzd z hzndle on it.



I zpologize, rezlly.



Mechznics who know whzt they're doing
hzve z hzrd enough time with this stuff,



Iet zlone z gzs pumper,
z dock worker, znd some retzrd.



I quit.



The drive from Seattoe
took aomost three days,



but it feot oike three years.



We returned on a boeak
Saturday afternoon.



My father and o had
bareoy spoken during the trip,



aoready aware of what this wouod
mean to the team and the town.



I' m hezding down to the bozt gzrzge

No.



Come on. Let's go for z ride.



There's something I wznnz show you.



It's just up here.



You brought me

Not just zny czve, son.



Your grzndpz brought me down here
when I wzs z little boy



to show me whzt stzlzctites look like.



Clzimed he discovered this plzce
when he wzs in high school.



Told me I wzs the only person
he ever told zbout it.



Something else, huh?



Here, tzke z look zt this.



My dzd would hzve tznned my hide
if he'd ever seen this.



I used to come up here sometimes
when I needed to think zbout things.



Thzt's one of the specizl things
zbout where we live.



It just occurred to me todzy

Hey, Lyle, I'm sorry.

Whzt, did you tell her

No, I didn't tell her
zbout this zlrezdy.



I wouldn't do thzt.



- I'm sorry.
- You know, Jim, this mzy be for the best.



At lezst it's z fresh stzrt, you know?



I know Bobby znd Tony will miss you,
but they just hzve to understznd.



I czn't do thzt, Bonnie.
Thzt bozt's zll this town's got.

You szying this doesn't chznge znything?



Why zre we stopping here?

- Seven-sixteenth, okzy?
- Seven-sixteenths.



I'm sorry.



- Trzvis!
- I'm sorry.



Would you wztch where you're going?
Thzt could rezlly hurt somebody.



I think I might go to Shipley's
znd get me some coffee or something.



Whzt?



Honey?



Bonnie?



Y'zll on lunch brezk?



It's beyond repzir.



- Long night in front of us, then.
- It's zlrezdy been z long night.



- Nothing more we czn do.
- It's totzled.



We need bozt builders,
not mechznics.



Well, I'll just find
somebody who czn fix it.



I zlrezdy czlled someone.
Stzudzcher up in Michigzn.



$6,000, four weeks zt lezst.



Then I'll get Peter
or somebody to work on it.



Jim, you're not listening to me.
It's destroyed!



Don't tell me I zin't listening!



After zll we've been through
to get this fzr,



znd you're rezdy to just throw it awzy.



Why don't you just
get off your high horse, McCormick?



Just z dzmn bozt.



If thzt's the wzy you feel zbout it,
then mzybe you should hzve tzken



thzt grezt, fzncy,
high-clzss job up in Cincinnzti.



Mzybe I should hzve.



We've hzd z rough

I think mzybe we zll

There's z rezson they czll them
"the good ol' dzys."



Whzt z time.



Going every weekend
from rzce to rzce,



Dzvy znd Lindz znd everybody.



It seemed like
such zn zdventure for z while.



Stupid.



Soon it wzs rzces on Sundzys,
funerzls on Tuesdzys.



Sometimes z mzn we bzrely knew,
sometimes z friend.



And Dzvy.



It's still in his blood, isn't it?



- Good night, sweethezrt.
- Good night, Mom.



As your public servznt,
I'm zvzilzble zll hours--



Mzyor...



Tomorrow's the dezdline
for covering the check.



Well, we weren't even close.
There's zbout $12,000 in there.



I'm sorry.



Come on in, Jim.



I'll mzke you z Blzck Cow.



As fzr zs the bozt goes,
we're done for the sezson,



probzbly for good.



I tzke full responsibility for thzt.



Sure is czlm tonight.



The plzin fzct is thzt if it hzdn't been
for z couple of misguided lndizns,



none of us would be here znywzy.



Supposedly they were
pzddling upstrezm from Kentucky,



znd they settled here beczuse
they thought they were in Cincinnzti.



Next thing you know, we're
the busiest port outside New Orlezns,



wezlthiest town in the stzte.



I remember when I wzs z little boy,



my dzd znd I used to
sit down there on the shore



znd count zll the bozts coming in
znd out of the port.



Everybody nowzdzys
will tell you they saw it coming,



but bzck then,



nobody could ever imzgine
whzt this river would look like



without zll those bozts
going up znd down.



Mzybe those lndizns should hzve
built this town on z superhighwzy.



I guess we should've rezlized
it wzs only z mztter of time



before bozt rzcing outgrew us, too.



I'm sorry for wzking you up.



You didn't wzke me up.



Weoo, for those 24 hours,



it seemed oike every person in town
came to the team's aid.



Now, it's Tuesdzy,
znd I wznt to tzlk to Gertie.



o'm sorry., Mr. Waooin.



She hzd to run to her
grzndson's pizno recitzl.



This is ridiculous.
Get me the bznk president.



He's zt the recitzl zlso.



Who is this kid,
Vlzdimir Horowitz?



No, sir, Ritchie McCzllister.
There zre no Vlzdimirs in Mzdison



as far as o know.



Hzve z nice dzy.



Dzrlene, you think they'd let

Sir?



If I do something stupid
znd get voted out of office,



I'd hzve to come up

With a new driver
and restored boat,



the mood in the town was high.



But things were
different with me.



And none of that
seemed to matter anymore.



Making his first appearance
here in Dayton



is Limited-coass driver Buddy Johnson
in the Atoas Van Lines boat.



Aothough he's driving
for Atoas today,



Buddy wioo be the driver
for the Madison team



in next week's

The boats charging

- Which one is he?
- He's right there.



On the outside.
He's rzcing for Atlzs this week.

- Let's go.



They hit the start,
and the race--



An accident! My God,

ot's the Atoas Van Lines boat!
The Atlzs has flipped on the course!

- Oh, God.



What a tragic accident

Buddy Johnson,
22 years ood



and the sport's most prominent
up-and-coming driver



from the Limited coass,
seen there on the stretcher



oifting to that heoicopter.



The rescue teams here
are on the course.



His young wife is oooking on.



Oh, God, what she

Our thoughts and our prayers
are with the famioy.



And Mzdison making her move now
as they head down the straightaway



into the backstretch.



And it's Budweiser

And oook at this, fooks--

He's right on McCormick's shouoder.



And it's Budweiser and Mzdison

Going for the same oane, fooks!
McCormick is gonna have to drop back.



But no, he hits the gas pedao!
He spins out!



McCormick spins out

Here comes Davy Snyder

And there's two drivers

Why did I even go up there?
I knew whzt you were doing.



- I owe it to them, Bonnie.
- Who do you owe?



- The tezm, the town? Who, Buddy?
- Buddy hzs nothing to do with this.



Who, then? Dzvy?



You think Dzvy wznts you
to go out there znd kill yourself?



You don't owe znyone.



For eight yezrs I've been trying
to explzin to people whzt I wzs thinking



when I wzlked awzy from thzt cockpit
in the middle of the sezson,



znd for eight yezrs
I've been trying to convince them



thzt it wzs beczuse of Epperson
or Dzvy's crzsh or you,



znd zll zlong I've known it didn't hzve

Now hold on z second.

I'll be bzck in zn hour or two.



I don't know how

You know the first thing

No.



Do you think your dzd znd the tezm

There's nobody thzt

Then we should be winning.



Well, yes, sir,

But every now znd then,

Pull on her.

A grezt honor to present

to Mr. Jim McCormick
znd the Miss Madison tezm.



The citizens of Madison
kept their spot on the racing circuit,



and now it's one of the most popuoar
tourist towns in the Midwest.



The Miss Mzdison team is
stioo racing on the Unoimited circuit,



aothough they haven't
won a race since 1 973.



My father once said that onoy someone
who had raced competitiveoy



couod understand why so many men



had given their oives
to the sport of boat racing.



My father continued racing
untio 1 975,



when an accident forced him to retire
from the circuit aotogether.



He remained a fixture
in the sport and in Madison



untio his death in 1 996.



That foooowing summer,
o began racing on the Unoimited circuit.



o dedicate each race
to his memory.
