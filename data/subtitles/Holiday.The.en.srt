00:00:11,538 --> 00:00:13,538
<b>Home Alone: The Holiday Heist </b>

2
00:00:20,839 --> 00:00:25,339
Yes, I cleared level 17. Hey Finn, press
pause for A bit why don't you kido.

3
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,600
- But this is a mega Boss Battle.
- Will you look at that snow.

4
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:31,219
You never got that in
California, that's for sure.

5
00:00:31,339 --> 00:00:37,119
You know guys, I have seen Christmas before
but this is Christmas Christmas.

6
00:00:37,159 --> 00:00:42,159
In the frozen tundra of dragons and worriers
There are ice serpents that spew frost venom.

7
00:00:42,219 --> 00:00:44,259
Let's just keep it in
the real world OK kido.

8
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,229
You are going to love it here, promise.

9
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:53,060
Finn, no more screen time until
we're at the new house I'm serious.

10
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,280
Turn it off.

11
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:15,340
Okay, guys. Welcome home.

12
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,460
Its so cold.

13
00:01:21,599 --> 00:01:22,620
Well?!

14
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:25,620
Oh boy

15
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,460
- Dad.
- What do you think?

16
00:01:27,579 --> 00:01:28,920
It's super creepy.

17
00:01:29,019 --> 00:01:33,859
Come on buddy, don't be ridiculous. It's
not creepy it's great. It is great honey.

18
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,159
Come on,
wait until you see the inside.

19
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:39,920
Guys, come on.

20
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:48,140
Honey, you've done good.

21
00:01:48,579 --> 00:01:49,659
And it's gonna be homely...

22
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:52,200
once we get all our stuff moved in.
Look at all the space.

23
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:56,579
How can we even afford it?
Did somebody die in here or something?

24
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,979
Alexis.
I'm serious.

25
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,480
People get really good deals if they
find like a dead body in the basement.

26
00:02:02,879 --> 00:02:05,040
No body died.
We got a good deal.

27
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,920
People moved out and we're moving in.

28
00:02:07,819 --> 00:02:09,379
Maybe it's haunted.

29
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,659
Probably built on an
Indian burial ground or something.

30
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,460
If we dig into the backyard,
I bet we find bones.

31
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:20,560
Ooo fess!!!
She's just pulling your chain, buddy.

32
00:02:21,020 --> 00:02:24,759
Mom mom, what was that? Did you hear that?
Was that a ghost - No, it's a Realtor.

33
00:02:25,259 --> 00:02:26,900
Hello, Baxter.

34
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:30,879
I was just putting the finishing touches
on this little house warming gift.

35
00:02:30,939 --> 00:02:35,439
- Wow thank you.
- And you must be the wee ones?

36
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:38,599
- Thatâ€™s the wee ones.
- Welcome to Maine.

37
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,240
They're not real good with real people.

38
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:45,420
They better with space robots
and cell phones and things.

39
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:49,280
You're gonna love it here, I guarantee it.

40
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,219
Does that mean you'll take this house
back if we hate it?

41
00:02:53,469 --> 00:02:56,199
Ho Ho Ho Ho they just so
precious aren't they?

42
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:01,039
Catherine, here are the keys.
And if you have any other questions...

43
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:06,219
- I have a question.
- What is it, honey?

44
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:07,620
In this house haunted?

45
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:14,159
Haunted? Do not be silly.
It just has personality.

46
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:17,939
What's that supposed to mean?

47
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,579
Welcome Mr. Hughes.
Nice ride.

48
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:38,159
If we're like going to
the prom or something.

49
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:45,240
Is this the best we can do. Hughes this is Jessica.
She's handling the security and surveillance.

50
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:48,319
Nice to meet you.
Let's get right down to it shall we...

51
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:52,180
- This here is our next target.
- A creepy old house?

52
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:55,979
A not just any creepy old house,
my dear girl.

53
00:03:56,060 --> 00:04:01,500
That creepy old house once belonged to
Jimmy Crovano, a notorious bootlegger.

54
00:04:01,919 --> 00:04:03,099
We're stealing boots?

55
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,780
Boot legging. He's smuggling alcohol.
When it was against the law in the 1920s.

56
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,900
Boots, Booze, I do not care
. Just as long as I get paid.

57
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:15,919
A well Jimmy, Dead Leg, Crovano,
was known for two things.

58
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,939
One, his boot leg Moonshine. And two...

59
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:24,879
He was the previous owner
of a priceless work of art.

60
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,800
Edvard Munch's, "The Widow".
Oh, God, Sinclair not again.

61
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:33,639
I have finally found her...

62
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:34,819
You say that every time.

63
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:39,100
When we broke into the Boston museum,
When we broke into the Bank of London...

64
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,120
When we broke into that Lama farm in Peru.

65
00:04:42,259 --> 00:04:44,439
Sounds like a wild goose chase to me.
I'm out.

66
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:50,120
- It's worth $85 million Dollars.
- I'm in is what I meant to say, I'm in.

67
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:54,040
Good. Well, I think we've found our self
A safe cracker.

68
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:01,240
Goodness sake.
Am I missing something?

69
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,259
Against my advice she got romantically
entangled with our last safe cracker.

70
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,000
Of course it ended predictably.

71
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:11,000
Now, look, this house
just came on the market.

72
00:05:11,379 --> 00:05:15,839
If we hurry, we can get inside
before any one even moves in.

73
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,079
Mrs. Catherine Baxter.
Look what the mailman hath brought.

74
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,620
Hu! Did you get into Hogwarts or something?

75
00:05:28,399 --> 00:05:33,159
It's an invitation to a holiday party
this weekend at my new bosses place.

76
00:05:33,220 --> 00:05:35,600
And when I say place
I mean private mountain.

77
00:05:35,889 --> 00:05:40,840
Oh wow look at that, Eggnog, Elves, Santa
Ow the kids will love this.

78
00:05:43,279 --> 00:05:47,139
Hay sweetheart. Look what I found?

79
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:53,019
Your little pop stars singing machine, remember? I
haven't played with that thing since I was a kid.

80
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:59,480
I love you daddy. You're so annoying.

81
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:03,339
Get out my room ha ha ha.

82
00:06:07,019 --> 00:06:10,639
Hay ya wanna come on down stairs
and help your mom and me unpack?

83
00:06:11,019 --> 00:06:14,899
I'd rather die.
Perfect have a good one.

84
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:18,639
Take that to Overkill ha ha ha ha.

85
00:06:21,439 --> 00:06:22,579
Hey, buddy.

86
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,959
Games already? I was kinda hoping you might wanna
explore the new house with me. . Ha what do you think?

87
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:32,519
- Captain Overkill's on line now.
- Sorry, your playing another kid?

88
00:06:32,939 --> 00:06:38,019
Yes, on line we play together all the time.
It's cool, he's my friend.

89
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:42,360
Well have you ever met this
friend like in real life? No.

90
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,720
But he's your friend.
What do you know about him?

91
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:47,840
He prefers pulse grenades.
Yeah, who doesn't.

92
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,100
Have you ever considered
making some real friends?

93
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,620
Why? Well you gotta get out
the house once in a while.

94
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,399
You know what I'm saying?
Try something new.

95
00:06:59,439 --> 00:07:02,399
Right, get out off your head once
in a while you know what I mean?

96
00:07:03,019 --> 00:07:06,459
Oh man. Pulse grenades, how
does he always do that?

97
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:08,100
Okay, off. That's it.

98
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,500
No more games until you help
mom and me unpack okay.

99
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
Lets go.

100
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,300
Coming.

101
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:25,199
- Done, want me to do the glasses?
- I'm gonna say no.

102
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:29,740
- Smell that?
- Yes.

103
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:34,699
You don't smell that in California my friend.
That's called air. It's all around this place.

104
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,740
Hum smells good.

105
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:39,459
That's a tent.

106
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,019
How about after we get settled in, you and I go
camping. Two men the great outdoors, what do you think?

107
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,620
Well you hate camping.

108
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,678
Ye well, maybe both off us need to
try things out of our comfort zone here.

109
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:56,439
You wanna take that one
down to the basement?

110
00:07:57,980 --> 00:08:01,360
And, basement, I'm coming with you
lets go.

111
00:08:14,899 --> 00:08:18,959
People get really good deals
if they find a dead body in the basement.

112
00:08:19,019 --> 00:08:22,600
The basement level on "Dragons
and Warriors" is a prison.

113
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:24,220
Filled with ghosts.

114
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:30,839
Ye well the basement in real life,
is just a basement.

115
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,500
You can do this.

116
00:09:44,539 --> 00:09:47,080
Dad like he's watching you.

117
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Down the stairs!!!

118
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,100
Mom, I know but...

119
00:10:03,159 --> 00:10:07,399
Go outside and go play it will be good for you
There's a boy next door you can play with.

120
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:12,100
I do not want to meet anyone new.
Can I just go upstairs and play my game?

121
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:14,059
Finn, are you trying to tell me
you're afraid to cross the yard...

122
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,120
- and meet a friend?
- What would we even talk about?

123
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Ask him what he likes to do for fun.

124
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:22,019
Oh guys, I am so sorry.

125
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:46,039
So, what do you like to do for
fun around here? Lots off stuff.

126
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:51,139
Like what?
You know build snowmen make snowballs...

127
00:10:51,559 --> 00:10:55,700
Go snow sledding, design snow forts
go snow skiing...

128
00:10:55,759 --> 00:11:00,480
make snow angels, start a snow avalanche,
wear snow shoes...

129
00:11:00,899 --> 00:11:04,000
play hide and go snow,
did I already say make snowballs?

130
00:11:04,659 --> 00:11:08,799
I get it, am but isn't there anything
that doesn't involve snow?

131
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:12,019
We can make Snow Cones? Oh Wait...

132
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:17,059
Maybe you could come over to my place for
video games. I have Robo Inventory 3.

133
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:19,120
It has multi-player.
You can be a strike robot.

134
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,519
Na aa now way.
Why not?

135
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,320
Your house is haunted that's
why the last people moved out.

136
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,019
Haunted?

137
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:30,019
Doors creak open.
Lights flash on and off for no reason.

138
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,539
It's the ghost of a
gangster who was murdered there.

139
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:34,720
He was smothered to death
in his sleep.

140
00:11:34,799 --> 00:11:36,740
No way that's real.
That's imaginary.

141
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:40,039
Oh It really. My mom said
it was a long time ago...

142
00:11:40,259 --> 00:11:43,440
but at night they say
you can still hear him.

143
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,440
Walking around, dragging his deformed
across the floor.

144
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,120
Looking for revenge against
anyone who tries to sleep.

145
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,059
I'd like to hang out with you
but I'm too young to die.

146
00:11:56,159 --> 00:11:57,840
Dead Leg is watching.

147
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:09,679
All right, big guy turn off the Video game it's
lights out. Can I do, can I do one more level?

148
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:16,580
Hi Hun, your liking your new room?
Hello?

149
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:22,639
- Take your headphones.
- They're ear buds.

150
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,000
Look, I know this move has been hard
on you. So why are we here, mom?

151
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:31,200
It's my new job.
Its a big step for me.

152
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,960
It's something I've been working towards
a long time. But more importantly...

153
00:12:35,039 --> 00:12:39,600
The reason we decided to move was because your father and I
decided that we wanted the best for you and your brother.

154
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:44,200
The best like a 32 gig tablet computer
with a pink sequin case?

155
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:46,799
There's more to the
holiday's than just gifts.

156
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:52,179
Great, lame Christmas.

157
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,919
That went well.

158
00:12:57,299 --> 00:12:59,480
Come on, we did it.

159
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:03,279
The Baxters have moved to Maine.

160
00:13:04,019 --> 00:13:07,779
Maniens, Mania .. acs or Manomiums.

161
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,519
This is a mistake?

162
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:14,399
Did I up root our family for a stupid Job
where nobody will appreciate me?

163
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:18,879
Sweet hart, we appreciate you.
You know that.

164
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:23,340
And you know your going
to be the best VP...

165
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:26,279
these maniacs have ever had.

166
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:35,120
I dragged us all the way across the
country. Our children hate me...

167
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:38,779
- That's not true, and you know it.
- Alexis hates me.

168
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:45,559
Ye okay, ye she hates you.
But shes gonna out grow it.

169
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,580
And our son spends every waking minute
plugged into video games.

170
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,120
Just needs a little push out of the nest
hes a little shy that's all.

171
00:13:54,259 --> 00:13:58,779
He has no real friends, friends his age
friends who aren't space marines.

172
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,919
He's scared of his own shadow.

173
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:03,879
He's got an over active imagination,
what's wrong with that?

174
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,779
Walking around, dragging his
deformed leg across the floor.

175
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,039
Looking for revenge against anyone...

176
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,240
but my room is totally haunted
by a ghost murderer aarrr.

177
00:14:27,299 --> 00:14:29,600
What? Oh buddy.

178
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,779
Okay, look I understand.

179
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,919
Change can be scary.
Moving, is never, never easy.

180
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,080
This isn't about change, Dad? This is
about survival I want to sleep in here.

181
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:45,440
- There's safety in numbers.
- Okay, honey bunch.

182
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:50,139
You are too old to be afraid of ghosts.

183
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:53,879
Real life is hard enough without
making up stuff to be afraid of.

184
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,000
You heard the boss right I mean back to bed
You'll be fine.

185
00:15:00,659 --> 00:15:02,799
You'll both be singing a
different tune tomorrow...

186
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:05,000
as an evil ghost
smothers me in my sleep.

187
00:15:05,059 --> 00:15:06,840
Back to bed.

188
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:14,799
Fine but if I have to sleep in there
all by myself I'm taking precautions.

189
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:22,220
Robosquad 256.

190
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,620
Police shields up and scanners online.

191
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:28,240
Weapons are charged permission
to fire on all ghosts.

192
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,519
This is not a drill.

193
00:16:45,139 --> 00:16:46,139
Got you.

194
00:16:47,419 --> 00:16:50,500
What in the world is going on.
I was trying to catch the ghost!!

195
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:53,759
Oh for gods sake.
With a stun gun in a tent?

196
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,860
I couldn't rule out vampire or zombie.

197
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,360
You are not to touch this ever.

198
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:03,700
But if I prove this house is haunted,
We can move back to California.

199
00:17:03,919 --> 00:17:06,619
- You're an idiot.
- Alexis, don't call your brother an idiot.

200
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:11,980
Finn, listen You know you know what Hun
it's OK I got this I got this its OK.

201
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:14,039
OK Sorry, Dad.

202
00:17:16,579 --> 00:17:17,759
Hey, buddy.

203
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,619
Finny Finny Finn, that's ah impressive.

204
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:28,019
What's going on?
I heard it Dad. It was... It was real.

205
00:17:28,519 --> 00:17:31,799
OK well ah, where... where did you hear it
Where is it?

206
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,319
Shuffling. Like someone was
dragging there dead leg.

207
00:17:40,079 --> 00:17:44,839
Oh, buddy look just a tree branch
you can hear it that's all.

208
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:51,240
Dude, I know this is
different than our old house.

209
00:17:51,319 --> 00:17:56,960
But I promise you you have absolutely
nothing to be afraid off OK, okay?

210
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:07,319
- We're too late.
- Somebody's already moved in.

211
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,339
Well that never stopped me before.

212
00:18:09,859 --> 00:18:12,680
We'll just wait until no
one is home and then...

213
00:18:14,420 --> 00:18:15,779
We'll strike.

214
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:21,920
Now eat up everybody we
have a big day today.

215
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:25,519
We are picking out our Christmas tree,
and we're getting new decorations, and...

216
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,720
Deck our new halls together.
How does that sound?

217
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:30,220
We should prepare. The ghosts
could come back while we're out.

218
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:36,519
Oh look kido, I don't care what you've learnt from your video game,
there's no such thing as ghosts especially at Christmas time...

219
00:18:37,319 --> 00:18:40,259
Ghost of Christmas Past, Ghost
of Christmas present...

220
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:42,920
Ghost of Christmas future,
Marley's ghost...

221
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,859
Well that's why we're getting a tree.

222
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:49,380
Because a little known fact,
Christmas spirit repels all ghosts.

223
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:53,480
Now, hurry up. We're gonna leave as soon as
your father is done clearing the driveway.

224
00:18:54,099 --> 00:18:55,319
That could be a while.

225
00:18:56,119 --> 00:18:58,759
Come on, I can do this.

226
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,220
- We can't live like this.
- Amateur.

227
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:18,180
What are you doing weirdo?
Making more ghosts traps.

228
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:20,480
I'm going to prove this place is haunted.

229
00:19:20,680 --> 00:19:22,759
You'll see. Then we can all move back home.

230
00:19:23,019 --> 00:19:27,079
There is no ghost, I was just
messing with you. No there is.

231
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:32,099
So whats your big plan? Rap the ghost up
and tuck it under the Christmas tree?

232
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:35,700
Look, if the ghost tries to get out
of the basement while we're gone...

233
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,500
This wrapping paper will rip
proof, the ghost is real.

234
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:43,420
Humm wouldn't real ghost
just float through the door?

235
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,839
You're not helping.

236
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:51,039
The driveways clear. Are you
guys ready, its gonna be fun.

237
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:40,720
With a crew back home we rolled in with shot
guns and masks off Presidents and everything.

238
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:44,099
I'm usually Ronald Reagan.
Do you want me to kick the down like yo...

239
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:48,160
Get down on the floor, nobody move, put the
money in the bag or I'll blow your head off...

240
00:20:48,259 --> 00:20:51,160
How fascinating. Why
don't you just shut up?

241
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,960
We're in.
Great.

242
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,359
Oh ginger bread cookies.

243
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,000
I like to eat the head first.
Then the arm, then the leg.

244
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,059
Understand this. My crew is expected...

245
00:21:39,119 --> 00:21:43,200
To slip in and out of our
targets, undetected like ghosts.

246
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,759
Got you chief. Oh you got me
Hughes did you? You really got me?

247
00:21:49,839 --> 00:21:54,940
And that doesn't mean dragging in dirt and snow
like that Or eating their freshly baked cookies.

248
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:00,400
And I don't care whether there ginger bread
men or Chocolate coated macaroons...

249
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:04,259
Chocolate covered coconut macaroons
were Steve's favorite.

250
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:06,960
Oh shut up, both of you.

251
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:13,380
Just look, this is important.
There can be no mistakes.

252
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:19,140
Right, all right now look pull
yourself together, Come on.

253
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,559
Deep breath. Come on now go.

254
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:24,480
Find yourself a nice
window and keep look out.

255
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,859
You, come with me.

256
00:22:28,200 --> 00:22:30,740
Is that a no go on a glass of milk?
Now.

257
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:41,160
There's nothing here.

258
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,329
Ah that's just what the old
bootlegger wants us to think.

259
00:23:12,539 --> 00:23:16,819
You know, sometimes
I even amaze myself.

260
00:23:17,359 --> 00:23:21,240
Come on, Ronald Reagan. You're up.
Get ready to have your mind blown.

261
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,900
Not use to doing this without the mask.

262
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:56,460
Oh would you look at that.
It reminds me of Steve.

263
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:03,400
That's what I'm talking about.
Ye move.

264
00:24:30,359 --> 00:24:32,619
I, I don't understand.

265
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,259
Maybe somebody beat us to it?
No.

266
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,119
Its impossible, all my
research, all my planing.

267
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:42,400
All the historical cross checking, I...

268
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:47,720
My beloved Gigi should be here.
Your beloved what?

269
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:51,319
We were supposed to have a
house together like this.

270
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:55,519
To grow old together. Baby I miss you.

271
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,900
Can you please just return my calls?

272
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:05,700
Oh crap, I gotta go. Please just call me.

273
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,420
Code red! Code red!

274
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:13,119
Code red quick, we've been
compromised go go go.

275
00:25:16,059 --> 00:25:21,480
Okay gang, So your mam and I will get the
straps Vin you and Alexis get the back.

276
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:29,460
Make sure the weight is balanced evenly.
OK Alexis Fin

277
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:32,470
I'm gonna come to you guys.
A ghost.

278
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,960
Are you sure you saw something?
Yes, it was right here by the window.

279
00:26:15,839 --> 00:26:19,680
Buddy, have you ever heard of the
fable the boy who cried ghost?

280
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:23,599
If my sweater is ruined you are so...

281
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:28,019
We should check to see if anything is out of place.
Finn come here, lets calm down and talk about this.

282
00:26:28,599 --> 00:26:33,319
Cookies are missing look look look look. There
were six ginger bread men here at breakfast.

283
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,619
Now there are only four.

284
00:26:34,839 --> 00:26:37,960
All this proves is that
someone disobeyed me...

285
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,079
when I said no ginger
bread men for breakfast.

286
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:45,859
And look, a ghost trap.

287
00:26:46,819 --> 00:26:49,259
The ghost is out.
It came from the basement.

288
00:26:49,319 --> 00:26:51,819
OK that is actually creepy.
Don't encourage him.

289
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:54,400
Honey, tell your son there's
nothing to be afraid off.

290
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,740
I think I just got the chills

291
00:26:57,019 --> 00:27:01,259
Nothing came out of the basement!!!
All of you are acting ridiculous.

292
00:27:01,299 --> 00:27:06,380
She's right!!! OK there's nothing there
and I'm just gonna check it out...

293
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:07,980
Dad wait...

294
00:27:11,619 --> 00:27:12,940
Light on.

295
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:18,220
Oh for crying out loud.
Frying pan, here we go.

296
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:21,400
OK... oo OK...

297
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:26,480
All is cool... looking good.

298
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:39,259
OK guys, look there's nobody down here.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

299
00:27:59,839 --> 00:28:04,480
Come on, Come on, Come on, we
can not be late. Lets go!!

300
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,980
Hello?

301
00:28:08,259 --> 00:28:10,839
Family? Hello?

302
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,859
My new boss is big on
punctuality, lets get a move on.

303
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:21,119
Ye I don't know just trying to decide. Is
this tie trying to hard. What do you think?

304
00:28:21,660 --> 00:28:24,680
What ever makes you happy, honey.
All I care about is that I time...

305
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,319
with a husband wearing pants.

306
00:28:26,539 --> 00:28:30,099
Pants? Wow well Laa Dee Daa!!!

307
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:43,480
We are leaving for the Christmas party
in five minutes. Why didn't you tell me?

308
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:47,019
I did many many times. My new
boss, the mountain lodge...

309
00:28:47,079 --> 00:28:48,920
Choraling eggnog... any
of that ring a bell?

310
00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:53,500
We had fun yesterday.
Do we really have to do it again?

311
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:56,759
Yes, we do.

312
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:05,039
What are you doing? I
have been calling you.

313
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:09,779
Turn it off. Just one more Level mom.
Please I'm so close to victory.

314
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:13,920
I'm almost done.
This is not open for discussion.

315
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:19,000
Oh man I was about to demolish
Captain over Kills armored base.

316
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,200
I am sure they can be demolished tomorrow.
Now hurry up, we're going to be late.

317
00:29:22,259 --> 00:29:23,779
Why don't you just go without me?

318
00:29:24,119 --> 00:29:27,480
Look, this is not a root canal or something
Its a Christmas Party.

319
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:28,779
They'll be other kids there.

320
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:33,079
That I'll have to talk to. An and
they'll ask me questions. And...

321
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:35,119
Will I have to sing?

322
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:38,519
Look I know your afraid off new
situations, but I refuse...

323
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:41,619
to raise a kid that is afraid of
everything isn't on a video screen.

324
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:49,440
Put on your shoes. I'm
gonna murder your sister.

325
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,920
What's going on?

326
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:56,039
Somebody took my headphones.
What?

327
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:59,579
That's it. Family announcement.

328
00:29:59,799 --> 00:30:01,279
We are not moving back to California.

329
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:06,920
Not because of ghosts. Not because of poorly
conceived acts of teenage rebellion, not ever.

330
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:12,599
We' are all going to learn to love this quaint little
town and this big creepy house because we have to Humm.

331
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:15,759
It's bad enough you dragged us
all the way across the country.

332
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:19,740
Now we've got to parade around with smiles on
our faces just so that you don't feel guilty?

333
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:23,559
So what you'd rather not go? Stay
at home is that what you want?

334
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:28,160
Totally, maybe I might actually like this place
If I wasn't around you guys all the time.

335
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:34,240
OK great, you two can stay hear while your dad
and I have all the Christmas fun we can handle.

336
00:30:34,839 --> 00:30:37,839
Seriously?
Ye you wanna stay home, stay home!!!

337
00:30:40,059 --> 00:30:42,319
But there are some terms and conditions.

338
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:46,039
First of all Alexis, you
are babysitting Finn.

339
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,579
Wait hold on.
Works for me.

340
00:30:47,660 --> 00:30:53,220
And no video games. No games
no TV no music no phone.

341
00:30:54,779 --> 00:30:57,240
They probably want you to leave her a
phone? These are my rules, no phone.

342
00:30:57,319 --> 00:31:00,960
Emergencies. Thank you honey OK,
phone for emergencies only OK.

343
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:04,400
OK great well, I'm glad
everyone got what they wanted.

344
00:31:08,759 --> 00:31:11,019
Have fun not being part of this family.

345
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:12,839
Merry Christmas.

346
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,700
OK guys, we'll call you
from the party. Behave.

347
00:31:26,779 --> 00:31:29,140
I don't think we've ever
made mam this mad before.

348
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:34,740
Whatever.
So I guess its just you and me?

349
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,880
You're on your own weirdo. You leave me
alone, I leave you alone. That's the deal.

350
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:43,720
But she took my game controller,
what am I suppose to do?

351
00:31:43,799 --> 00:31:47,240
I don't care. Whatever you
want, we're home alone.

352
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:56,180
Mmm, I wonder if they
sell them individually?

353
00:31:57,460 --> 00:32:01,019
Huu alright I just have
to stabilize the ankles.

354
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:04,119
Who's Gigi?
None of your business.

355
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:06,200
What! Who's Gigi?

356
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:10,420
By the safe you said my beloved
Gigi should be here so...

357
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,980
I wanna know who are we really looking for.
Are we looking for a body?

358
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,279
Come here.

359
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:24,359
Gigi was my great grandmother...

360
00:32:24,380 --> 00:32:30,000
and if you must know she is the widow.

361
00:32:34,299 --> 00:32:37,900
Edvard Munch was so enraptured
by her doleful beauty...

362
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,460
That he painted her into a masterpiece.

363
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,700
In the painting she's seen
sitting with her children.

364
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:47,579
Her family. My family.

365
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,519
Oh the canvas was stolen decades ago.
But I'm going to find her.

366
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:56,059
She belongs to me.

367
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,099
You okay sweaty?
Sure, why?

368
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:02,660
Because your still holding
Finns controller.

369
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:06,880
Thanks!

370
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,619
If I just... I do not know I.

371
00:33:11,079 --> 00:33:15,640
I'm all for pushing Finn out off the nest a bit.
But should we really leave them home alone?

372
00:33:15,859 --> 00:33:20,140
In a new place? You know what a
few hours away, will be nice.

373
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:25,200
Hey maybe they'll learn a thing
or two about responsibility.

374
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:36,359
I'm jumping on the sofa.
I do not care.

375
00:33:41,259 --> 00:33:45,440
I'm eating junk food.
I don't care.

376
00:33:48,759 --> 00:33:53,420
I broke a lamp.
I can't hear you and I don't care.

377
00:33:54,819 --> 00:33:58,380
The name's Baxter. Finn Baxter.

378
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:35,019
Robo Squad 256, are you ready
to infiltrate the core?

379
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:41,539
Yes commander, boosters
engaged in three, two, one.

380
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:46,699
Attack.

381
00:34:50,860 --> 00:34:52,039
Awesome!

382
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,679
Awesome!

383
00:35:07,699 --> 00:35:10,500
Look at all the Santas.
Look at that.

384
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:14,280
Welcome, welcome our new addition.

385
00:35:17,159 --> 00:35:18,880
Thank you I'll see you later.

386
00:35:19,039 --> 00:35:21,360
Mr. Carson, thank you
so much for having us.

387
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,019
But of course, you're part
of the Carson family now ha.

388
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:27,039
Over here guys Wait a minute.

389
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,460
Albert, I don't pay you to loaf about.

390
00:35:34,539 --> 00:35:37,960
Please get our lovely new
vice president an eggnog.

391
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:41,960
Oh no I'm sorry, this is my husband Curtis.

392
00:35:42,179 --> 00:35:45,980
What! I'm her husband I'm Curtis.
How are you?

393
00:35:48,380 --> 00:35:53,440
My mistake, he's the spitting
image of Albert My butler.

394
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:55,079
Now deceased.

395
00:35:56,019 --> 00:35:58,380
Oh the ties the same to.

396
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:04,880
Have you ever thought of taking
on the assignment off huu?

397
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,840
Hu well I never thought
but I'm sure I could.

398
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:13,159
And you have kids to, seven of them.
Huu two.

399
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:20,019
Oh its probably for the best, all
those clutching little hands errrr.

400
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:22,139
Where are the little tikes?

401
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:26,760
Oh there still adjusting to the move. You know so
we decided to leave them at home for the evening.

402
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:32,280
Great that's great. More reindeer
to blanket for the rest of us.

403
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:39,000
I've hired the best real bearded
Santas in the country.

404
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:41,519
To serve our cocktails.

405
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,239
Here's one now. Dig in!

406
00:36:44,420 --> 00:36:47,039
CHALLENGE CAPTAIN OVERKILL
TO A ROBO DUEL?

407
00:36:49,559 --> 00:36:51,719
This time your going down.

408
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:13,880
What's happening? Hay hay what's going.
No no no nnn no

409
00:37:14,039 --> 00:37:17,099
Not the batteries. Come on turn on!

410
00:37:18,639 --> 00:37:21,360
Oh my gosh no no no no no.

411
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:26,019
Ha no! Ah Oh my gosh!

412
00:37:29,039 --> 00:37:30,159
OK

413
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:41,059
Yes! Yes! OK! OK!

414
00:37:50,539 --> 00:37:54,900
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo!

415
00:38:04,840 --> 00:38:07,260
No, Oh No Hu!

416
00:38:07,659 --> 00:38:09,699
Ye! No!

417
00:38:20,380 --> 00:38:26,559
Hi so how's it going over there?
All is quiet with no music or TV.

418
00:38:27,519 --> 00:38:30,380
I'm actually reading.
Ha Ha, sure you are.

419
00:38:30,460 --> 00:38:32,800
I am, an article about lipstick.

420
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,780
So it's not War and Peace, but
hay I'm technically reading it.

421
00:38:35,940 --> 00:38:37,780
OK and Finn?

422
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:40,840
He's downstairs playing board
games with that Snow kid.

423
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:43,260
Oh he is that's great.

424
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:46,840
Hay It's really snowing up here,
are you guys warm enough?

425
00:38:47,019 --> 00:38:50,639
Yes, you don't have to call and
check up on us every five minutes.

426
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:53,119
The phone is for emergency use only.

427
00:38:53,219 --> 00:38:56,059
Fair enough I'll text when
we're headed back. Love you.

428
00:38:56,219 --> 00:38:57,280
Love you bye.

429
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:01,940
Now can you help me?
It'll take you ten seconds.

430
00:39:02,739 --> 00:39:07,539
OK I'll your dumb battery
Then I'm gonna go check out the mall.

431
00:39:07,579 --> 00:39:11,460
But you can't tell Mom I went out, deal
Deal.

432
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:21,360
What was that?
Don't be such a chicken.

433
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:27,219
I got it lets go. Why do you think
a ghost lives down here anyway?

434
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,619
Cos I found the ghosts room.

435
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,179
Look.

436
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,320
But this was locked. I tried it.

437
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:49,159
A ghost must have opened it.

438
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,519
If you're trying to scare me
Its not going to work.

439
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:56,820
It probably only looks empty.

440
00:39:57,639 --> 00:40:01,900
In Robo Infantry 2, you could find
amo rooms that looked empty...

441
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:06,679
but they would have a secret door.
This isn't some stupid video game looser.

442
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:09,400
There's no secret door. See.

443
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:16,739
Holly cow Did I mention that the
secret rooms were often booby-trapped?

444
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:18,840
Come on.

445
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:26,340
This is totally cool.

446
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:34,079
Oh OK Oh well you've seen it.

447
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:39,079
Let's go.
Talk about a creepy family.

448
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:43,280
Ye wait wait come here.
Come and look at this.

449
00:40:44,860 --> 00:40:49,079
Look, look at the old women eyes.

450
00:40:51,059 --> 00:40:53,400
I think, I think there moving.

451
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:56,800
Like she's watching us.

452
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:03,019
No, no she's, she's watching you.

453
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:12,800
Boo!
Arrr, Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...

454
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:20,500
It was a joke.

455
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:31,159
Well, what do we have here?

456
00:41:34,019 --> 00:41:38,980
Touch my hooch and regret it, Dead Leg.

457
00:41:56,159 --> 00:41:58,340
Oh phone phone phone phone.

458
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:06,219
Finn, Finn I'm stuck. Open the door.
Finn, come down here.

459
00:42:06,539 --> 00:42:08,579
Finn, can you hear me?

460
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:30,860
What do you say we ditch this shindig?

461
00:42:30,960 --> 00:42:33,860
Err its gonna take us a while to get
back down the mountain in this weather.

462
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:37,860
Sounds good. I want to get home before
bedtime, in case Finn is scared.

463
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,360
I love you.

464
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,139
To you my dear say your goodbyes.

465
00:42:44,199 --> 00:42:47,519
Excuse me, everyone, out off my way

466
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,139
Ah theirs good news and bad news.

467
00:42:52,719 --> 00:42:57,559
The bad news is that this
little winter storm.

468
00:42:58,239 --> 00:43:00,420
Has picked up you know.

469
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:07,219
And all the roads leading down the mountain
will be temporarily closed.

470
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:10,699
Arr excuse me sir, for how long?

471
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:15,219
Good question, Carla.
Oh Its Catherine actually.

472
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:20,360
For those in the back, Carla Baxter.
Our new VP.

473
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:29,300
And asks how long we expect
the roads to be shut down?

474
00:43:32,199 --> 00:43:36,320
I have no idea. But the good news is.

475
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:43,840
There plenty more adult eggnog right.
Go get them, Santas.

476
00:43:59,179 --> 00:44:03,000
I'm here. Hello Finn, I'm down stairs.

477
00:44:04,739 --> 00:44:10,960
Who builds a house like this is, this
is so lame. Now I'm talking to myself.

478
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:18,820
Di Did you leave yet?

479
00:44:26,699 --> 00:44:29,940
Gonna be stuck here for A while.
Frozen Pizza in freezer.

480
00:44:30,019 --> 00:44:34,780
[ I.M ] Make sure Finn's in bed by 10 pm
Well A deals a deal.

481
00:44:34,900 --> 00:44:40,320
[ I.M] Everything cool
having fun don't worry.

482
00:44:41,179 --> 00:44:44,380
OK OK well I guess we'll just
have to make the best of it.

483
00:44:44,760 --> 00:44:47,019
Ye I'll get you an eggnog.

484
00:44:55,280 --> 00:44:58,369
Ooow you were out of pulse grenades.

485
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:16,860
You've beaten me like a million times.
How do you always do it?

486
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:19,460
- Is this Andy?
- Who's Andy?

487
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:24,579
- Wow how old are you dude?
- Ten.

488
00:45:25,059 --> 00:45:27,139
Man I thought you were this
other guy I played with.

489
00:45:27,179 --> 00:45:28,519
If I'd known you were just a kid...

490
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:31,440
I wouldn't of over killed you so
many times. So what if I'm ten?

491
00:45:31,539 --> 00:45:35,619
No, you rock dude you're good. You just
need to learn to preserve your ammo.

492
00:45:35,659 --> 00:45:38,599
- Do you know what the word conserve means?
- I'm ten, not an idiot.

493
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:42,480
Right right sorry
So how did you get so good?

494
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:47,260
Practice. You just got to devote 10 to
14 hours a day to the game you know.

495
00:45:47,360 --> 00:45:50,039
Priorities. My parents will only
let me play for an hour A day.

496
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:53,619
That's your problem right there.
I live alone so...

497
00:45:53,719 --> 00:45:58,079
You can play video games all day and night and
no one ever tells you to clean up your room?

498
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:02,500
Ye it's pretty much thee
best thing about going to College.

499
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:03,929
Sounds amazing.

500
00:46:04,539 --> 00:46:08,900
So I asked for the new Robo expansion
pack for Christmas. What did you ask for?

501
00:46:09,480 --> 00:46:12,880
I don,t really do the hole Christmas thing
since I don't live with my folks anymore.

502
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:14,960
So your not going to visit them?

503
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:20,219
Naa I don't really have, you know the cash...
To blow on plane tickets right now anyways.

504
00:46:21,139 --> 00:46:24,500
- So you don't get Christmas?
- Oh they'll send me something.

505
00:46:26,519 --> 00:46:31,960
- Well if you're alone, it is not really Christmas.
- I never thought about it like that before.

506
00:46:32,659 --> 00:46:36,219
I.. I'll keep you company.
Wanna play again?

507
00:46:36,519 --> 00:46:38,639
Sure. I'll even give you some pointers.

508
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:49,320
- O'Oh, Oh what you got to go?
- Do you believe in ghosts?

509
00:46:49,679 --> 00:46:53,940
Finn, I believe this plain of
existence has many mysteries.

510
00:46:56,139 --> 00:46:59,179
Right it's just a branch, just a branch.

511
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:17,840
Dead Leg.

512
00:47:30,739 --> 00:47:34,019
- Perimeters clear.
- No movement all good.

513
00:47:34,389 --> 00:47:38,400
I don't want to alarm you, but I think I
just saw someone in that window upstairs.

514
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:41,760
A flickering or a I don't
know a shadow, or something.

515
00:47:41,780 --> 00:47:43,940
This guy in town was telling
me this place is haunted.

516
00:47:44,159 --> 00:47:46,280
The gangster who stole your
great grannies picture...

517
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:47,760
He got murdered in this house.

518
00:47:47,860 --> 00:47:51,579
You left that part out didn't you. Maybe he
doesn't want anyone to touch his painting.

519
00:47:51,659 --> 00:47:54,639
You know if we had some sage we
could cleanse the house out.

520
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:56,280
Don't be absurd.

521
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:00,559
- I don't want to upset some ghost gangster.
- Look we're going in. Ghost or no ghosts.

522
00:48:00,599 --> 00:48:03,789
Now come on lets go get your tools.
You too come on.

523
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:08,679
- Dude can you still hear me?
- Its the ghost hes back.

524
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:12,659
Did you watch a scary movie on
cable or something? What no!!

525
00:48:12,719 --> 00:48:16,659
Whatever you do, do not stay up
late and watch R rated movies.

526
00:48:16,699 --> 00:48:20,400
It sounds like a good idea, but
you can't un-see that stuff man.

527
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:24,840
I have to do something.
Hiding under the blankets sometimes works.

528
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,210
You're not helping. Be right back.

529
00:48:40,820 --> 00:48:42,719
I thought you said they
were at a Christmas party.

530
00:48:42,719 --> 00:48:45,440
It's the ghost, It's the ghost.

531
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:54,980
Oh I know what it is. It's just
a security device that's all.

532
00:48:55,059 --> 00:48:56,920
Or maybe they didn't all
go to the the party.

533
00:48:57,039 --> 00:48:58,480
Look don't be silly.

534
00:48:58,539 --> 00:49:04,619
You know Santa Claus, elves, eggnog... I mean people
in small towns, they love that kind off crap.

535
00:49:05,099 --> 00:49:07,480
I don't know. I'm getting
a ghostly feeling.

536
00:49:07,539 --> 00:49:08,619
I think I'm feeling it too.

537
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:12,960
Look there are no ghosts, you fools.
I mean God Listen to yourselves.

538
00:49:13,019 --> 00:49:14,019
Come on.

539
00:49:15,750 --> 00:49:19,119
Err I'm not walking into a haunted
house in the middle off the night.

540
00:49:19,219 --> 00:49:22,579
I'm not crazy.
I'm getting chills on the back off my neck.

541
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:27,389
- Code red, Code red!!!
- Come back here, come back.

542
00:49:36,590 --> 00:49:39,650
It worked. The ghost is gone.

543
00:49:48,659 --> 00:49:50,039
What's that?

544
00:49:50,039 --> 00:49:51,659
Finn!

545
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,579
Finn!

546
00:49:55,980 --> 00:49:58,079
Finn!

547
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:00,840
Finn!

548
00:50:01,239 --> 00:50:06,199
Alexis, are you home?

549
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:09,079
Finn!

550
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:10,739
Why!

551
00:50:11,699 --> 00:50:13,280
Dad.

552
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:27,519
- Finn, it's me.
- Alexis?

553
00:50:27,739 --> 00:50:32,349
Get me out of here. I'm
stuck in the basement.

554
00:50:32,389 --> 00:50:36,519
- In the secret room?
- Yes, moron. I've been yelling for you.

555
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:39,679
I'm in the upstairs bathroom. I
thought you were at the mall?

556
00:50:39,800 --> 00:50:43,639
I wish I was at the mall.
Where are Mom and Dad?

557
00:50:43,699 --> 00:50:46,059
They sent a text, they're gonna be late.

558
00:50:46,139 --> 00:50:50,039
Great it's so creepy down here.

559
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:52,539
You gotta get me out now.

560
00:51:15,460 --> 00:51:18,320
Walk up too the safe, Walk up too the safe

561
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:20,219
Aww she can't hear me.

562
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:24,780
I'll get you out somehow I promise.
She still can't hear me.

563
00:51:31,599 --> 00:51:33,438
- More snow.
- I see that.

564
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:34,760
Wanna make snowballs with me?

565
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:36,980
I have a system to make
the perfect snowball.

566
00:51:37,099 --> 00:51:39,440
I can't right now. My sister
is trapped in the basement.

567
00:51:39,519 --> 00:51:41,219
Gonna have to buy supplies to her out.

568
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:43,619
Oh cool.
See you later.

569
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:26,780
That,s 2152 dollars and 71 cents.

570
00:52:29,039 --> 00:52:31,159
And whom should I make this out to?

571
00:52:31,420 --> 00:52:35,719
We only take personal checks
with a valid driver's license.

572
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:38,340
I must of left that in my other pants.

573
00:52:38,860 --> 00:52:44,420
What can I get for a dollar 68 cents?

574
00:52:46,739 --> 00:52:49,800
Happy holidays. Merry Christmas.

575
00:52:55,619 --> 00:52:58,269
- I.m sorry.
- Be careful, young man. What's the rush?

576
00:52:58,300 --> 00:53:00,239
Is there a fire somewhere?

577
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:31,360
An Americano, on pumpkin Mocha Latte,
with extra whipped cream. Thanks.

578
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:34,619
- I'm still not going in the haunted house.
- What it gonna take for you...

579
00:53:34,639 --> 00:53:37,860
Two bozos to complete the job
you were explicitly hired to do.

580
00:53:37,940 --> 00:53:43,590
That is break into an empty house and
steal a simple painting. Please do tell.

581
00:53:43,659 --> 00:53:45,980
More money.
Aa ye more money.

582
00:53:46,039 --> 00:53:48,619
More money oh you got to be kidding?

583
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:54,920
And you, you drag in filth and crumbs into the
scene? And you, you botch the look out an amateur.

584
00:53:55,039 --> 00:54:01,070
And now you want a bigger split of the spoils
oh come on? I believe you want your Gigi back?

585
00:54:02,019 --> 00:54:06,000
Look we had a deal. 25% for you...

586
00:54:06,099 --> 00:54:08,789
25 for ding bat here and 50 for me.

587
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:12,190
Ye well the deals changed
now since the ghosts.

588
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:16,599
50 Percent for me, 50 percent for
Jessica, 25 percent for you.

589
00:54:20,739 --> 00:54:21,599
What

590
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:28,260
Look we're gonna split it three ways.
Otherwise we walk a Gigi goes bye bye.

591
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:32,659
You are a hard hearted woman.

592
00:54:36,199 --> 00:54:38,039
Want to help me finish my snow fort?

593
00:54:38,139 --> 00:54:42,019
I can't right now, a team off art thieves
are planning an assault on my new house.

594
00:54:42,119 --> 00:54:45,320
- I'm the only one who can defend it.
- Oh cool see you later.

595
00:55:04,579 --> 00:55:05,679
Billy

596
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:07,739
Alexis

597
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:13,880
The house isn't haunted we're
under siege, Its being robbed!

598
00:55:13,980 --> 00:55:16,119
This isn't one of your games Finn.

599
00:55:16,239 --> 00:55:19,519
I know I was wrong about the ghosts
before, but there are art thieves.

600
00:55:19,679 --> 00:55:23,079
Just stop screwing around,
and get me out off here.

601
00:55:23,199 --> 00:55:25,219
Or find someone who can.

602
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,739
Whats up little man need some more players?

603
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,619
Thieves are attacking my house.
I'm under siege.

604
00:55:35,699 --> 00:55:36,840
What game are you talking about?

605
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:39,960
They're almost here. How do I
stop them from getting in?

606
00:55:40,199 --> 00:55:42,340
Um, sounds like a tower defense game!

607
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:45,139
Like level 17 on Robo Infantry 3.

608
00:55:45,289 --> 00:55:48,099
Exactly. Now what are your
characters skills and abilities?

609
00:55:48,199 --> 00:55:50,260
Umm I'm good at traps.

610
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:56,199
Excellent, now don't just set one or two, the key to
these type of games you need to stagger your defense OK.

611
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:59,920
I have to identify the weakness in
my perimeter. And set the turrets.

612
00:55:59,940 --> 00:56:03,559
Right but to really win, you need
traps that deploy on there own.

613
00:56:04,059 --> 00:56:06,340
Like your pulse grenades.

614
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:09,840
AAA you figured out my my secret
now how much ammo do you have?

615
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:14,179
Well none, all I could afford
was this spool of string.

616
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,260
I gotta get this game it sounds awesome.

617
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:21,719
- AAA so that's not allot to work with.
- I can use my environment.

618
00:56:21,780 --> 00:56:27,219
Great ye um that's how these games usually work. You
need to think out side the box and find other resources.

619
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:31,409
Ye I can do that. Ye I know you can
dude your like the smartest kid I know.

620
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:35,340
You can figure out the specifics. And hey if
you need any more pointers I'll be online...

621
00:56:35,380 --> 00:56:39,239
For the next eight to ten years probably.

622
00:56:39,300 --> 00:56:41,820
- You know what my dad always says?
- What?

623
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:46,389
You got to get outside the house buddy.
Enjoy the real world.

624
00:56:46,420 --> 00:56:48,590
It's the best game there is.

625
00:58:27,239 --> 00:58:30,579
The only thing to be afraid
of in this house is me.

626
00:58:41,800 --> 00:58:42,940
Look at this.

627
00:58:43,539 --> 00:58:47,019
See the house is haunted, the
ghost knows were coming...

628
00:58:47,119 --> 00:58:50,420
Oh really! Ah did the
ghost use that bucket to?

629
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:55,480
- He's got a point.
- Come on you two focus here... All right.

630
00:58:55,559 --> 00:59:01,159
We're not a bunch of two bit bandits. We're not
going to be stymied by a slippery walkway.

631
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:04,420
All right follow me OK.

632
00:59:10,440 --> 00:59:14,579
Roll up garage doors, easiest
kind to brake into. Good.

633
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,940
Hurry up.

634
00:59:29,019 --> 00:59:31,659
Its stuck on something.
Something supernatural.

635
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,219
Oh shut up, go help her go on.

636
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,519
Come on.

637
00:59:54,420 --> 01:00:00,420
Stop screwing around. Jessica circle the perimeter
off the house see if theirs a window open.

638
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:04,360
And you, Mr. President,
Get into the garage.

639
01:00:04,579 --> 01:00:08,900
The house has a mind off its own.
Ah unlike someone I know.

640
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,239
Boring.

641
01:01:14,099 --> 01:01:16,460
What are you looking at?

642
01:01:24,860 --> 01:01:26,199
I'm in.

643
01:01:27,219 --> 01:01:30,440
Now go round and open the front door.

644
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:18,079
I ain't afraid of no ghost.

645
01:02:22,659 --> 01:02:25,059
Coming in handy, Rudolph.

646
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:09,539
How do you like me now?

647
01:03:24,980 --> 01:03:27,119
The house has got me.

648
01:03:53,420 --> 01:03:54,860
Gross.

649
01:04:47,639 --> 01:04:49,539
Art Thieves?

650
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:53,980
Awesome. My perimeters totally holding up.

651
01:04:54,059 --> 01:04:57,960
Hey err I've been searching the net and I
can't find whatever game your playing.

652
01:04:58,539 --> 01:05:02,380

653
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,699

Siss my defenses are holding.

666
01:05:51,139 --> 01:05:54,380
You said they're art thieves. Which
means they're looking for the painting.

667
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:56,579
Which means they're coming right to me.

668
01:05:56,659 --> 01:06:02,030
You need to call the police. Call mom and
dad. Call an adult any adult, do you hear me?

669
01:06:02,119 --> 01:06:05,639
Your phone's dead. You really
should do better about charging it.

670
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:08,519
It is cool they think I'm a ghost.

671
01:06:08,659 --> 01:06:11,079
I don't care if they think you're Santa.

672
01:06:11,179 --> 01:06:14,119
Don't worry if they get to
you, we go with plan B.

673
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:18,059
Plan B? What are you talking about plan B?

674
01:06:22,219 --> 01:06:26,440
<i>Hey this is Alexis, I'm busy right now but
leave me a message and I'll call you back...</i>

677
01:06:33,900 --> 01:06:36,579
They'll be in bed, that,s why
no ones answering It's late.

678
01:06:36,619 --> 01:06:41,420
Oh maybe but when they've said something I I
need to hear they're OK from there own mouths.

679

in three days, four tops.

682
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,960
This minor emergency will pass.

You do not know me, but I want
you to know that your son is OK.

712
01:09:09,239 --> 01:09:10,770
How do you know my son?

01:09:19,619 --> 01:09:22,579
I hacked Finn's gamer tag and I got your
Info from the credit card statement.

717
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:24,939
I'm worried something bad
is going to happen to him.

a way into this house.

Ho no you don't.

801
01:18:31,529 --> 01:18:33,420
Forget it. I don't need this.

802
01:18:33,479 --> 01:18:39,380
When you err cracked the safe before, did it ever
occur to you too write the combination down?

803
01:18:39,670 --> 01:18:43,479
Shh I've almost got it. I've never
had to crack the same safe twice.

804
01:18:43,640 --> 01:18:47,279
But I'll write it down this time, in case we
want to come bake and crack it again tomorrow.

805
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:54,260
I really can't work out whether your being
sarcastic, or your really really dim?

806
01:18:54,819 --> 01:18:56,920
You see what I'm talking about?

807
01:18:57,210 --> 01:19:00,859
The crime is happening right now. This
is live footage of the actual criminals.

808
01:19:01,020 --> 01:19:03,539
In Maine, I mean a a...

01:19:05,359 --> 01:19:09,119
You missed the crime scene
by like 3000 miles.

811
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:13,109
This is it.

812
01:19:13,140 --> 01:19:15,239
Oh no they've cracked the safe.

813
01:19:15,840 --> 01:19:18,159
Oh I am so getting paid.

814
01:19:18,300 --> 01:19:20,619
One more step and I'll smash it to pieces.

815
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:24,720
What another child? Are they coming out
of the walls in this place or what?

816
01:19:25,140 --> 01:19:26,960
Children coming out of the walls...

817
01:19:27,000 --> 01:19:29,260
Not literally. Watch the door.

818
01:19:29,640 --> 01:19:34,140
Now young lady, you any idea
how much trouble your causing?

819
01:19:34,239 --> 01:19:37,319
I know this painting must be worth
allot for you to go through all this.

820
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:41,180
A painting ripped in half, can be repaired.

821
01:19:41,260 --> 01:19:44,640
The same can not be
said for little girls.

822
01:19:46,670 --> 01:19:49,359
- Got to go fast gotta go fast.
- Careful, honey.

823
01:19:50,470 --> 01:19:52,248
Slowing down.

824
01:19:52,250 --> 01:19:55,520
Is it there? Ye yes

825
01:19:58,159 --> 01:20:02,460
That was amazing. I mean I can't
believe you did that Look at her.

826
01:20:02,600 --> 01:20:04,739
- Snow is awesome.
- Thanks.

827
01:20:04,880 --> 01:20:08,539
Now you watch her. I'm
going back for my sister.

828
01:20:08,619 --> 01:20:12,279
- Yes, sir.
- Finn, are you there? It's plan B time.

829
01:20:12,359 --> 01:20:16,279
Finn, are you there plan B?
Why you hes not going to help you.

830
01:20:16,539 --> 01:20:19,300
Just give me the painting
and no one will get hurt.

831
01:20:23,390 --> 01:20:26,000
It's even more beautiful
than I imagined.

832
01:20:26,079 --> 01:20:30,460
- Really I think it kind off sucks.
- This painting is rightfully mine.

833
01:20:30,539 --> 01:20:34,439
It is my families brush with
greatness immortalized.

834
01:20:34,659 --> 01:20:38,659
A perfect reminder
Sitting on my mantelpiece forever.

835
01:20:38,899 --> 01:20:41,439
Wait if your keeping the painting
how are we all getting paid?

836
01:20:41,460 --> 01:20:45,380
We can talk about this later.
Don't make me put on my Ronald Reagan mask?

837
01:20:46,199 --> 01:20:48,020
I'm coming, sister.

838
01:20:48,100 --> 01:20:50,140
Finn, it's plan B time.

839
01:20:53,699 --> 01:20:58,380
Give it to me, total stupidity
hey get out off...

840
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:11,210
She did it she did it she surly, ye...

841
01:21:12,399 --> 01:21:14,819
Well go on open the door, you idiot.

842
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:17,680
I break into safes, not out of them.

843
01:21:18,250 --> 01:21:21,340
Maybe you can work on that. In prison.

844
01:21:26,939 --> 01:21:29,199
You did it, little bro.
It worked?

845
01:21:29,319 --> 01:21:32,920
It totally worked, so totally worked.

846
01:21:36,520 --> 01:21:39,720
Hey kid whats going on, wait?

847
01:21:39,770 --> 01:21:42,390
Kid kid help me out, I can't move.

848
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:44,520
Wu what did you do?

849
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:55,560
Move move move. You know what to do.

850
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:02,020
Guys come on, not again?

851
01:22:11,140 --> 01:22:14,979
- Mama.
- Are you all OK?

852
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,539
- Were fine were fine I promise.
- We were so worried.

853
01:22:18,640 --> 01:22:22,159
- I'm so glad to see you guys.
- Is everybody OK here?

854
01:22:22,890 --> 01:22:26,149
Ye but there are two bad guys
trapped in the basement. What!

855
01:22:26,189 --> 01:22:28,840
But don't worry. It's not
to scary down there.

856
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:31,220
Bad guys?

857
01:22:32,500 --> 01:22:37,439
Get me out of here. Please. Help.

858
01:22:54,939 --> 01:23:01,359
Were you just gonna skip out on Jessica too, that's
cold man. I new I should of stuck to my old crew.

859
01:23:01,720 --> 01:23:05,119
My GiGi, I had her in my hands.

860
01:23:06,699 --> 01:23:10,119
She's gone. So get over it.

861
01:23:12,859 --> 01:23:15,260
Finn, I owe you an apologize.

862
01:23:15,979 --> 01:23:19,220
You warned us you heard something.
And we should off believe you.

863
01:23:19,460 --> 01:23:20,829
I should have believed you.

864
01:23:21,300 --> 01:23:24,199
It's OK it wasn't anything
I couldn't handle.

865
01:23:24,779 --> 01:23:28,100
Are you trying to tell me you weren't
afraid? Well I was at first.

866
01:23:28,859 --> 01:23:34,020
But an active imagination is actually pretty
useful when your not using it to scare yourself.

867
01:23:35,140 --> 01:23:36,659
How about you, Alexis?

868
01:23:36,859 --> 01:23:40,020
Ye I was scared but hay at
least this place isn't boring.

869
01:23:41,500 --> 01:23:42,819
Your not gonna believe this.

870
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:46,840
That painting in the basement
has been identified as...

871
01:23:46,979 --> 01:23:50,640
The lost masterpiece by Edvard Munch.

872
01:23:51,479 --> 01:23:53,140
- Edvard whom?
- Munch.

873
01:23:53,319 --> 01:23:57,420
That Scandinavian guy
He painted the Scream.

874
01:23:57,520 --> 01:23:59,220
The the what?

875
01:23:59,420 --> 01:24:01,319
The scream. You know this.

876
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:05,739
Aw Dad, aw you guys, stop.

877
01:24:06,079 --> 01:24:10,500
It was stolen from a museum in 1918.
They thought it was lost forever.

878
01:24:10,699 --> 01:24:16,159
It is valued at $ 85 million dollars.

879
01:24:18,739 --> 01:24:22,640
Oh my god is there a reward
theirs a reword right?

880
01:24:23,670 --> 01:24:26,359
Funny you should ask, because.

881
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:29,739
As a finder's fee, they
generously gave us this.

882
01:24:34,180 --> 01:24:38,119
Four free member passes to
the museum for one year.

883
01:24:38,359 --> 01:24:40,859
Oh a not valid holidays or Sundays.

884
01:24:41,640 --> 01:24:44,420
That's very nice.
That no reward.

885
01:24:44,500 --> 01:24:47,020
We save their famous painting
and that's how they repay us...

886
01:24:47,220 --> 01:24:50,119
by making us go to a museum? Lame.

887
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:52,479
This season isn't
about material things...

888
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:56,060
Its about family, and we're all safe.
And that is reward enough.

889
01:24:58,279 --> 01:24:59,460
Oh one more thing.

890
01:24:59,939 --> 01:25:03,960
The thieves were wanted in several
states, and we got that reward too.

891
01:25:04,039 --> 01:25:05,619
30000 Dollars.

892
01:25:09,920 --> 01:25:14,020
30000 Dollars.
Aw wow a shopping spree for everyone.

893
01:25:14,100 --> 01:25:15,560
Video Games.

894
01:25:18,920 --> 01:25:21,699
I want to thank you for
helping my son Simon.

895
01:25:21,920 --> 01:25:25,000
I just gave him a little encouragement
He did it all on his own.

896
01:25:26,390 --> 01:25:28,640
Sorry about the hole kidnapping scare.

897
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:34,380

a pepper sprayed you allot.

898
01:25:34,560 --> 01:25:37,960
Ah they were just doing their job.
Well a we make it up to you.

899
01:25:38,100 --> 01:25:41,819
Finn tells me that you can't afford
to visit your family this year.

900
01:25:42,960 --> 01:25:47,119
Well ye umm, well we want
to buy you a plane ticket.
