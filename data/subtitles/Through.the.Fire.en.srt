1
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:16,444
Sebastian came to me. I was coaching
the 11-year-olds and under.

2
00:00:16,515 --> 00:00:19,780
He came to me when he was six
and said he could play.

3
00:00:19,851 --> 00:00:21,876
I said, "No, you're not ready yet."

4
00:00:21,954 --> 00:00:24,514
He said, "Dan, I promise I can play."

5
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:26,421
So I gave him a shot.

6
00:00:26,491 --> 00:00:29,983
I didn't play him. I put him on the team,
but I never played him.

7
00:00:30,062 --> 00:00:33,964
My best player fouled out.

8
00:00:34,032 --> 00:00:36,557
I put him in,

9
00:00:36,635 --> 00:00:38,899
and he was making moves that...

10
00:00:38,971 --> 00:00:42,498
I couldn't describe them,
because he was six years old,

11
00:00:42,574 --> 00:00:45,338
and I was like, "Oh, my God."

12
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,344
And we lost the game,

13
00:00:47,412 --> 00:00:52,577
but we went upstairs
and I told my mother, "He can play."

14
00:00:52,651 --> 00:00:56,849
I said, "A little work, a little help here,
a little help there, he can play."

15
00:00:56,922 --> 00:00:59,914
And then he told me.
After everybody went to bed, we sat up,

16
00:00:59,992 --> 00:01:04,554
he told me, "Dan, I really
want to play this game. I want to be good."

00:02:14,332 --> 00:02:16,698
I mean, the kid been
making noise for years,

29
00:02:16,768 --> 00:02:21,899
and they're talking about him like he's a
superstar already, which, in a sense, he is.

30
00:02:21,973 --> 00:02:24,965
In the 'hood, he's a superstar to them.

31
00:02:25,043 --> 00:02:29,810
He has a cult following. It's like people
are obsessed with seeing what he do,

32
00:02:30,315 --> 00:02:32,146
because they've never seen it.

33
00:02:32,217 --> 00:02:35,744
I've been here 37 years. I've never
seen a game like that in Coney Island.

34
00:02:38,657 --> 00:02:44,527
He has a smile,
he's marketable, he's intelligent.

35
00:02:44,596 --> 00:02:48,293
He has everything.
He has everything that a superstar needs.

40
00:03:13,158 --> 00:03:17,652
Ain't nobody ending. Ain't nobody leaving
from the court. All day, 24-7.

41
00:03:17,729 --> 00:03:21,927
I can't sleep sometimes. From my window
I can hear the ball bouncing all night.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,662
All night. All night.

43
00:03:27,672 --> 00:03:30,197
Right. This is MSG.
We call it the Garden.

44
00:03:30,275 --> 00:03:34,644
So this is where all the talent comes and
plays. Everybody comes and competes.

45
00:03:34,713 --> 00:03:37,409
This has been going on a long time.
It's the Garden.

46
00:03:37,482 --> 00:03:39,973
Everybody knows
about the Garden in New York.

47
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:42,451
Back up, back up, man.

48
00:03:46,825 --> 00:03:48,725
Hi.

49
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:51,820
- How you doing?
- <i>(woman)</i> Hi. How are you?

50
00:03:51,897 --> 00:03:55,162
If there was a place
where I had to put my child,

51
00:03:55,233 --> 00:03:58,760
and I wanted him
to be a basketball player,

52
00:03:58,837 --> 00:04:01,863
I'd put him right in Coney Island,
anywhere in Coney Island,

53
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:04,101
from Stillwell to Seagate.

54
00:04:04,609 --> 00:04:06,702
Every block,
there's a basketball court.

55
00:04:06,778 --> 00:04:11,181
When you step out of the building you see
the court, and that's what your friends do,

56
00:04:11,249 --> 00:04:15,709
so you've got no choice
but to play basketball.

57
00:04:15,787 --> 00:04:18,381
And then having
Stephon make it out of the projects.

58
00:04:18,456 --> 00:04:20,321
All the kids, we all saw that.

59
00:04:20,392 --> 00:04:22,758
He pulled up with his Bentley,

60
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:27,458
and we know his mother has a big house,
and that's something that we all wanted.

61
00:04:27,532 --> 00:04:30,365
Third floor.
That's my window right there. Third floor.

62
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:33,199
Stephon - fourth floor, you know?

63
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:36,206
That's where all the talent
comes from around here.

64
00:04:36,274 --> 00:04:39,437
Sebastian's a mixture
of a lot of players from Coney Island.

65
00:04:39,511 --> 00:04:42,139
He has the talent like Stephon,

66
00:04:42,214 --> 00:04:44,614
he got a jump shot like me,

67
00:04:44,683 --> 00:04:47,379
he got a handle
like the kid named Strawberry

68
00:04:47,452 --> 00:04:50,182
that lives on 20-07, used to be here.

69
00:04:50,255 --> 00:04:52,314
He's a mixture.

70
00:04:53,358 --> 00:04:55,258
Give me five. Here. Here.

71
00:04:55,327 --> 00:04:59,661
- I got money.
- Give me a dollar. Give me a dollar.

72
00:04:59,731 --> 00:05:01,426
You don't want the ball?

73
00:05:01,499 --> 00:05:05,265
He ain't from Coney Island.
What you doing to them in the house?

74
00:05:05,337 --> 00:05:09,273
You gotta sleep with the ball. When
you're growing up, put it under your arm,

75
00:05:09,341 --> 00:05:11,332
go to sleep on it.

76
00:05:11,409 --> 00:05:13,969
And your dream will come true.

77
00:05:15,447 --> 00:05:18,712
<i>(Sebastian)</i> Look. Rest in peace, Deuce.
This is his wall here.

78
00:05:18,783 --> 00:05:23,152
Got killed on the streets. Gunned down.
He was on his way to Georgia Tech.

79
00:05:23,221 --> 00:05:25,815
He lived right in this building right here.

80
00:05:25,891 --> 00:05:28,485
So we definitely keep his name alive,

81
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,223
and every time we walk by,
we say, "What's up?" to him.

82
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:35,164
Like, "What's up, Deuce?"

83
00:05:36,334 --> 00:05:40,031
<i>(man)</i> Everybody starts, but nobody
finishes when it comes to basketball.

84
00:05:40,105 --> 00:05:42,403
One year half the team failed off.

85
00:05:42,474 --> 00:05:47,070
They all decided that they wasn't gonna go
back to school, they wasn't gonna finish,

86
00:05:47,145 --> 00:05:50,876
and they're still here not finishing.

87
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:54,646
That's why when we get one,
the whole 'hood embraces him.

88
00:05:55,253 --> 00:05:57,244
<i>(Sebastian)</i> Give me five, huh? Whoo!

89
00:05:57,322 --> 00:05:59,381
Give me five, huh?

90
00:05:59,457 --> 00:06:01,982
This is my little brother Ethan right here.

91
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:06,121
Ethan, King Osiris, the mighty king.

92
00:06:06,197 --> 00:06:08,722
He's next.
They're coming for you, little bro.

93
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,236
He'll go for a hundred million
out of eighth grade.

94
00:06:13,738 --> 00:06:16,571
Whoo! Whoo!

95
00:06:16,641 --> 00:06:19,633
It's a cycle.
He'll be just like me. I was just like him.

96
00:06:19,711 --> 00:06:21,269
In one.

97
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:25,146
This is what we wanna do
for the rest of our lives - play basketball.

98
00:06:25,216 --> 00:06:27,616
- I'm tired.
- You tired?

99
00:06:29,854 --> 00:06:31,822
<i>(laughter)</i>

100
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,017
So you beat me.

101
00:06:35,093 --> 00:06:36,958
- You beat me, son?
- You gotta win.

102
00:06:37,028 --> 00:06:40,361
You gotta. You're the man.
You're the king of the clay.

103
00:06:43,034 --> 00:06:45,195
<i>(woman)</i> OK.

104
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:51,340
This is my mother.

105
00:06:51,409 --> 00:06:55,072
For all the reporters that call and
want to speak to my mother and see her,

106
00:06:55,146 --> 00:06:58,240
here she is, right here, all right?

107
00:06:58,316 --> 00:07:00,284
I'm making some lunch for the boys.

108
00:07:00,352 --> 00:07:02,616
My mother's the best cook in the world.

109
00:07:02,687 --> 00:07:05,451
If you don't know that,
you better ask somebody.

110
00:07:05,523 --> 00:07:07,423
For real.

111
00:07:07,492 --> 00:07:09,323
My mother's a warrior.

112
00:07:09,394 --> 00:07:13,023
There was times... When we say when
we were coming up that we was poor,

113
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:16,659
it was not, like,
poor that we lived in the projects and...

114
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:19,135
We was poor, man.
We didn't have nothing.

115
00:07:19,204 --> 00:07:23,607
We didn't have anything, really, so...
There was times...

116
00:07:24,676 --> 00:07:27,907
I remember, and I always said -
I never said this on camera -

117
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:30,447
there was times
when I had no sneakers.

118
00:07:30,515 --> 00:07:33,382
I would have a pair of boots,
and I had no sneakers.

119
00:07:33,451 --> 00:07:37,148
So I had to borrow
a pair of sneakers from my friends,

120
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:40,487
or take my sister's -
we used to wear the same size sneakers -

121
00:07:40,558 --> 00:07:43,322
or take her sneakers
and go to my games.

122
00:07:44,396 --> 00:07:46,227
That was...

123
00:07:46,297 --> 00:07:49,095
I remember those things.
I don't forget.

124
00:07:50,835 --> 00:07:54,965
A lot of people would have made a bigger
thing about everything I was doing.

125
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:58,237
My mother helped
keep me levelheaded.

126
00:07:58,309 --> 00:08:03,406
She'll be happy about it, she'll smile
about it, but she was like, you know:

127
00:08:03,481 --> 00:08:06,041
"It's really nothing until you make it."

128
00:08:06,117 --> 00:08:08,278
She's seen
what happened with my brother.

129
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:12,949
My brother had one foot inside the door,
then they snatched his dream from him.

130
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:17,018
- This is my big brother.
- I don't play that.

131
00:08:17,095 --> 00:08:19,928
See? I said
I'd show you my big brother.

132
00:08:22,667 --> 00:08:25,227
My brother...
Being in a poor family,

133
00:08:25,303 --> 00:08:29,899
my brother had a chance to go to the
NBA, so she was excited about that.

134
00:08:29,974 --> 00:08:36,903
Then when it didn't happen, that shattered
a lot of dreams within my household.

135
00:08:37,782 --> 00:08:42,617
<i>(Daniel)</i> My brother Jamel
went to Providence. He went four years.

136
00:08:42,687 --> 00:08:47,249
He led the Big East at scoring,
and he didn't get drafted.

137
00:08:47,325 --> 00:08:50,556
That was never heard of.
I'd never even heard of that before.

138
00:08:51,362 --> 00:08:54,991
<i>(Sebastian)</i> I remember that day.
We was in the house watching the draft.

139
00:08:55,066 --> 00:08:59,799
We was reading in the magazines
he's gonna be between ten and 15,

140
00:08:59,871 --> 00:09:02,431
so we just knew
he was gonna get drafted.

141
00:09:02,507 --> 00:09:07,103
We all sat here and we waited for his name
to be called, and it never got called.

142
00:09:07,178 --> 00:09:11,114
You look at the second round,
you'd think there's not a lot of good players,

143
00:09:11,182 --> 00:09:14,117
but Jamel Thomas
from Providence, I like his game.

144
00:09:14,185 --> 00:09:17,518
I think these guys are steals
if they fall down any further.

145
00:09:17,589 --> 00:09:21,650
I was just thinking
that everybody was gonna be all right,

146
00:09:21,726 --> 00:09:23,591
everybody was gonna be all right.

147
00:09:23,661 --> 00:09:27,392
Unfortunately,
everybody just got hurt from it.

148
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,663
I didn't even get picked up at all.

149
00:09:31,736 --> 00:09:37,675
The whole house was crying
and it's like, "What am I supposed to do?"

150
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:44,276
That experience
was probably the worst day of my life.

151
00:09:44,349 --> 00:09:48,547
To be honest, when Steph made it,
I thought I made it too. I felt like I made it.

152
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:52,784
It was like, "OK, you made it,
everybody else is gonna make it."

153
00:09:52,857 --> 00:09:56,884
And then when he bought his mother
the house, I had the same ideas.

154
00:09:56,961 --> 00:10:02,558
Thought it was gonna be like that,
but it just didn't happen.

155
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:07,970
But I'd tell Sebastian, I'd say, "That's
why you must work hard every day."

156
00:10:08,039 --> 00:10:11,566
"Put yourself in my shoes
and don't put yourself in Stephon's shoes."

157
00:10:11,643 --> 00:10:16,239
"You don't want to happen to you
what happened to me."

158
00:10:16,314 --> 00:10:21,752
You know, it hurt my mother so, and she
was so devastated, she just couldn't take it.

159
00:10:21,819 --> 00:10:25,880
She wouldn't be able to take it
if that was to happen to Sebastian.

160
00:10:25,957 --> 00:10:30,291
So that's why she's really shy
with the cameras and stuff like that -

161
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:33,455
she really ain't into it, you know.

162

165
00:10:41,573 --> 00:10:43,234
I'm working for my mother,

166
00:10:43,308 --> 00:10:48,007
to change that day around, that draft day,
for her, which wasn't good.

167
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:52,573
You know, for me to come
and put a smile on my mother's face.

168
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,210
And we're gonna do it too.

Good afternoon,
and thank you all for being here.

171
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:22,912
We're all here for one main reason,
and I would like to introduce him now.

172
00:11:22,981 --> 00:11:25,745
Please welcome Sebastian Telfair.

173
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:32,988
Thanks. Thank you.

174

here today and showing support for me.

I appreciate it. Thank you.

176

To also, my family, I want
to thank you all for sticking with me.

177

I know it ain't easy. I watch you go through
everything I go through. I love you all.

178
00:11:47,138 --> 00:11:49,470
Everything is gonna be good.

179
00:11:50,241 --> 00:11:52,675
Now I'll tell you what
I came to tell everybody,

180
00:11:52,744 --> 00:11:58,182
that I will be attending the University
of Louisville, with Rick Pitino.

181
00:11:58,249 --> 00:12:00,649
I'll take any questions.

182
00:12:15,466 --> 00:12:17,434
Right there.

185
00:12:24,976 --> 00:12:27,137
- Are you prepared?
- Am I prepared?

186
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:29,679
Yes, I'm prepared.

<i>It'd be three in a row</i>.

199

If you can win three championships

200
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:31,001
in a league where Hall-of-Fame players
came from, that's unbelievable.

201

275
00:19:57,128 --> 00:19:58,891
Thank you for everything.

276
00:19:58,963 --> 00:20:02,194
Watching him, I realize
that if he puts on a Louisville uniform,

277
00:20:02,266 --> 00:20:06,430
he'll be the best point guard that I would
have coached at the collegiate ranks.

278
00:20:06,504 --> 00:20:11,669
And you have Derek Jeter, Yankee
superstar come in. Then you have Jay-Z.

279
00:20:11,742 --> 00:20:16,042
Then you have two or three professional
scouts, which makes me uneasy.

280
00:20:16,113 --> 00:20:20,880
Jeter was great, Jay-Z was outstanding,
but the pro scouts made me a little uneasy.

281
00:20:20,951 --> 00:20:23,818
So I left in a little bit of turmoil,

282
00:20:23,888 --> 00:20:28,052
because that was probably the first time
since recruiting Sebastian

283
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:32,824
that I felt there was a chance
he could entertain the NBA.

284
00:20:34,732 --> 00:20:38,828
Telfair, can I have
your signature, please?

285
00:20:42,139 --> 00:20:44,039
Thanks, Telfair.

286
00:20:44,108 --> 00:20:46,338
<i>(Jamel) This year's</i>
<i>important for Sebastian.</i>

287
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:50,107
<i>To be honest. I think</i>
<i>that's a good decision to go to Louisville.</i>

288
00:20:50,181 --> 00:20:55,710
But I think as the season goes on,
I think scouts and gyms will bite.

289
00:20:56,787 --> 00:21:00,416
They'll take him out.
I think he's that good.

290
00:21:01,992 --> 00:21:05,621
But I'm on my way to Greece
to play professional basketball,

291
00:21:05,696 --> 00:21:11,293
and the reason why I have to go,
because I provide the money for my family.

299
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:46,631
Mr. Sebastian Telfair,
who are you going with?

300
00:21:46,704 --> 00:21:49,571
- King James.
- King James.

301
00:21:53,878 --> 00:21:56,403
Oh, dunk that, Bronny.
Let's go.

302
00:21:56,480 --> 00:22:00,211
We gotta get some more of those.
We gotta get some more of those.

303
00:22:00,284 --> 00:22:04,448
King James. That's all you needed,
the dunk. That's it. It's over.

304
00:22:04,521 --> 00:22:08,958
It's just a game when you're playing,
but this is a business.

305
00:22:09,026 --> 00:22:12,462
Definitely at the time that I'm coming up,
it's a lot different.

306
00:22:12,529 --> 00:22:18,525
These guys like LeBron James, $90 million
for the sneaker contract, this ain't no game.

307
00:22:18,602 --> 00:22:23,369
$90 million - 100, whatever he got -
for a sneaker?

308
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,237
That's not no game.
This is serious.

309
00:22:25,309 --> 00:22:28,278
At a certain age,
a certain stage in your life,

310
00:22:28,345 --> 00:22:33,977
if you're one of those people,
it turns completely into a business.

311
00:22:34,051 --> 00:22:37,509
When I was in junior high school
I wanted a tattoo.

312
00:22:37,588 --> 00:22:40,716
I wanted a tattoo or something.
My brothers shout me down:

313
00:22:40,791 --> 00:22:44,090
"You can't get no tattoos.
It's not gonna be good for your image."

314
00:22:44,161 --> 00:22:47,653
So that's my business.
I'm starting my business right there.

315
00:22:48,365 --> 00:22:51,095
That's like a job.
Like, people get up and go to work,

316
00:22:51,168 --> 00:22:55,332
I get up and go to school
and play basketball.

317
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:59,733
Your first business you're gonna get,

318
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:03,337
if you're one of the top basketball players,
is the sneaker market,

319
00:23:03,414 --> 00:23:07,373
where they got a basketball camp,
like Adidas, Reebok and Nike.

320
00:23:07,451 --> 00:23:11,979
The sneaker companies come and recruit
you and try to get you to go to their camp.

321
00:23:12,056 --> 00:23:14,524
You're with them
through your high-school years,

322
00:23:14,591 --> 00:23:17,116
and so when you go on
to college or the NBA,

323
00:23:17,194 --> 00:23:20,789
you're friends with them and
that's what sneaker you'll sign with.

324
00:23:20,864 --> 00:23:25,028
The first thing we in the industry do
is identify the kid.

325
00:23:25,102 --> 00:23:30,665
Then you get the kid and he's on your
camp list, he plays in your all-star games.

326
00:23:30,741 --> 00:23:34,871
He'll get every new product
that the company has. I guarantee it.

327
00:23:34,945 --> 00:23:37,937
He's no different than Jay-Z
going into a playground.

328
00:23:38,015 --> 00:23:42,008
He walks in, all the people know who he is
and you want him showing your logo.

329
00:23:42,086 --> 00:23:44,316
But you gotta have
the high-school team,

330
00:23:44,388 --> 00:23:49,519
because you have access to
the paraphernalia of the high-school kid -

331
00:23:49,593 --> 00:23:54,394
all the uniforms that they wear, the gym
that they play in, signage everywhere.

332
00:23:54,465 --> 00:23:56,695
It's a smart promotion.

333
00:23:58,168 --> 00:24:01,069
That's a gift from Adidas.

334
00:24:02,873 --> 00:24:06,809
Brandon, come over and help me with this.
Find me some 12s.

335
00:24:06,877 --> 00:24:10,369
I think today's kid - the star kid,

336
00:24:10,447 --> 00:24:14,543
the one that you've anointed through
the media and through your own intuition -

337
00:24:14,618 --> 00:24:20,648
when he's given the goodies,
he is gonna be the man.

338
00:24:20,724 --> 00:24:23,124
Whoo!

339
00:24:23,193 --> 00:24:28,563
He knows it and the world knows it,
and the teammates know it also.

340
00:24:30,601 --> 00:24:33,161
6-2.

341
00:24:37,274 --> 00:24:40,607
- <i>(man)</i> What's on the line, Tiny?
- The sneakers.

342
00:24:40,677 --> 00:24:43,202
They're playing
for the sneakers right now, man.

343
00:24:43,280 --> 00:24:45,475
Anything goes.

344
00:24:45,549 --> 00:24:46,538
Ooh.

345
00:24:46,617 --> 00:24:50,212
Those sneakers.
Watch those shoes, man.

346
00:25:04,735 --> 00:25:08,694
Here are the sneakers.
Here are the sneakers.

347
00:25:15,412 --> 00:25:18,870
Big game.
We're going to Sheepshead Bay.

348
00:25:18,949 --> 00:25:22,112
You know,
they always give us a hard time.

349
00:25:23,353 --> 00:25:26,550
The atmosphere over there is crazy.

350
00:25:28,692 --> 00:25:31,684
All the other sports,
they get a bus to go to the games.

351
00:25:31,762 --> 00:25:33,821
The basketball team, we don't.

352
00:25:33,897 --> 00:25:38,095
And we're, like, the best team in the school.
We don't get no love.

353
00:25:38,168 --> 00:25:41,433
All these championships,
we should get a bus.

354
00:25:41,505 --> 00:25:44,804
- It's cold out here, man.
- It's freezing.

355
00:25:44,875 --> 00:25:49,005
<i>(Nyan)</i> I don't like coming through here,
man. Especially at night, man.

356
00:25:49,079 --> 00:25:51,673
I don't like this stuff.

357
00:25:51,748 --> 00:25:54,546
We gotta do this
every other game, man.

358
00:25:54,618 --> 00:25:57,178
We'll be smacking teams,
'cause we'll be pissed off.

359
00:25:57,254 --> 00:26:01,247
By the time we get there
we'll be mad already.

360
00:26:01,325 --> 00:26:04,954
I think we got off
at the wrong stop, man.

361
00:26:06,897 --> 00:26:08,888
<i>(cheering)</i>

362
00:26:14,138 --> 00:26:16,333
He's gonna stop!

363
00:26:16,406 --> 00:26:19,068
No foul! No foul!
He's gonna stop.

364
00:26:36,793 --> 00:26:39,921
<i>(Sebastian)</i>
Yo, where are the uniforms at?

365
00:26:39,997 --> 00:26:42,329
Where are the uniforms at?

366
00:26:52,709 --> 00:26:56,042
He wants to play,
wants to help his team.

367
00:26:56,847 --> 00:26:58,781
So...

368
00:26:59,850 --> 00:27:04,514
I always tell him,
if it ain't broken, you can play, so...

369
00:27:08,025 --> 00:27:10,516
Sebastian, please be careful.

370
00:27:47,364 --> 00:27:49,525
<i>(crowd chanting)</i>

371
00:28:05,282 --> 00:28:07,079
<i>(buzzer)</i>

372
00:28:24,601 --> 00:28:28,833
I'm not mad because we lost.
I'm mad at everybody because...

373
00:28:28,905 --> 00:28:34,172
Y'all motherfuckers don't sacrifice
for nothing. All y'all care about is y'all.

374
00:28:34,244 --> 00:28:37,873
If y'all don't go out and fight for each other,
and dive on the floor,

375
00:28:37,948 --> 00:28:43,318
and scratch and bite, whatever you gotta
do to win, together, we ain't gonna win.

376
00:28:43,387 --> 00:28:45,548
We ain't gonna win.

377
00:28:46,623 --> 00:28:50,389
Not fucking hanging around.
You're tragic.

378
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:53,623
You should be
the motherfucker busting your ass.

379
00:28:53,697 --> 00:28:57,098
Ain't nobody gonna fucking fail me
with the college. Nobody!

380
00:28:57,167 --> 00:28:59,533
You should be
the first nigger trying to do it.

381
00:29:01,138 --> 00:29:07,373
I didn't go to college. All my brothers went
to college, but I put my foot in the ass.

382
00:29:07,444 --> 00:29:09,207
All of them.

383
00:29:11,648 --> 00:29:13,479
Wake up, man.

384
00:29:13,550 --> 00:29:17,577
Better wake up.
You're only as good as right now.

385
00:29:17,654 --> 00:29:20,282
Once it's over, it's over.

386
00:29:20,357 --> 00:29:22,848
Once it's over, it's over, yo.

387
00:29:29,032 --> 00:29:31,500
<i>(Dan) These awards are my pride and joy.</i>

388
00:29:31,568 --> 00:29:37,666
This - "We present this award to our
assistant coach of the year Daniel Turner.

389
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:41,277
"From all your players."

390
00:29:41,345 --> 00:29:45,372
This is all voluntary, what I do.
Everything I do is from my heart.

391
00:29:46,149 --> 00:29:48,913
The big thing - my brother's there, so...

392
00:29:48,985 --> 00:29:52,079
I told my mother
I'd take care of him, so...

393
00:29:53,156 --> 00:29:55,681
That's pretty much why I do that.

394
00:29:56,526 --> 00:30:02,795
I'm one of Sebastian's biggest fans,
so I put this together.

395
00:30:02,866 --> 00:30:04,834
You know?

396
00:30:04,901 --> 00:30:07,631
This is his first year at ABCD camp.

397
00:30:07,704 --> 00:30:09,763
He turned it out.

398
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:13,207
His first year at ABCD camp,
he was with Stephon.

399
00:30:13,276 --> 00:30:15,267
This one right here, he's 13.

400
00:30:15,345 --> 00:30:18,542
That's when he first
really became noticed.

401
00:30:18,615 --> 00:30:24,076
I don't know if you can get this,
but this is Stephon and Sebastian.

402
00:30:24,154 --> 00:30:28,386
Sebastian was seven.
Stephon was still at high school.

403
00:30:28,458 --> 00:30:30,983
That's throwback for you right there.

404
00:30:31,061 --> 00:30:35,259
I think I sacrificed a lot
for my brothers.

405
00:30:35,332 --> 00:30:39,860
And not just Sebastian,
for all my brothers.

406
00:30:39,936 --> 00:30:43,372
That was my job, being the oldest,

407
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:47,308
you know, to make sure
they fulfilled their life.

408
00:30:47,377 --> 00:30:49,140
You know, I live through them.

409
00:30:49,212 --> 00:30:54,479
At the end of the day,
I'm happy 'cause they're happy.

410
00:30:54,551 --> 00:30:56,951
That's all that matters.

411
00:31:22,879 --> 00:31:24,540
<i>(Tiny)</i> Ten.

412
00:31:24,614 --> 00:31:26,912
Doubling it - 20.

413
00:31:26,983 --> 00:31:29,747
At least you got two vowels.

414
00:31:30,387 --> 00:31:35,290
Is it your turn, Coach?
I'll be taking the lead.

415
00:31:35,358 --> 00:31:37,588
What are you gonna spell with that crap?

416
00:31:37,661 --> 00:31:39,322
Not with this, you gotta...

417
00:31:39,396 --> 00:31:43,833
- I know. I played Scrabble.
- All right, then.

418
00:31:47,737 --> 00:31:50,069
University of Louisville.

419
00:31:55,378 --> 00:31:58,040
Hey, what's up?

420
00:31:58,114 --> 00:32:00,708
- What up?
- What's up with you?

421
00:32:01,785 --> 00:32:04,015
Sebastian, how are you, man?
How you been?

422
00:32:04,087 --> 00:32:06,578
In the zone, buddy.
In the zone.

423
00:32:14,097 --> 00:32:16,759
This shit's crazy.

424
00:32:29,446 --> 00:32:31,744
We need some equipment
at Lincoln, man.

425
00:32:31,815 --> 00:32:35,615
If I get a chance, I'm gonna
get Lincoln some equipment like this.

426
00:32:35,685 --> 00:32:37,846
This is nice.

427
00:32:39,990 --> 00:32:41,719
This is the dorm at Louisville.

428
00:32:41,791 --> 00:32:44,817

Know what I mean?

Get them Cardinals to the nationals.

475
00:36:33,022 --> 00:36:37,686
After the game, I got a call from
Sonny Vacarro and I'm speaking to him,

476
00:36:37,761 --> 00:36:42,528
'cause he's somebody that always helped
me out all through my years at high school,

477
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:46,968
and I get a lot of information from him.
So I'm thinking, "I just had a good game."

478
00:36:47,036 --> 00:36:50,233
I'm not thinking,
"OK, NBA guys is looking at me now."

479
00:36:50,306 --> 00:36:54,174
He spoke to me.
He was like, "Things is turning."

480
00:36:54,244 --> 00:36:56,235
I was like, "What do you mean?"

481
00:36:56,312 --> 00:37:00,112
He was like,
"I think you got a shot of going to the NBA."

482
00:37:00,183 --> 00:37:02,378
So I laughed.
I called my mother.

483
00:37:02,452 --> 00:37:05,717
She was like, "Oh, yeah, yeah.
Don't listen to that."

484
00:37:32,515 --> 00:37:36,315
We was all together.
We heard something like shots.

485
00:37:36,386 --> 00:37:38,581
We didn't know what it was.

486
00:37:38,655 --> 00:37:42,921
My mother was nervous
and Ethan was hysterical.

487
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:48,888
There's ten of us in my family.
It could've been any one of us.

488
00:37:48,965 --> 00:37:52,696
And my little brother Ethan plays
in this hallway, running up and down.

489
00:37:52,769 --> 00:37:55,704
This hallway's haunting me.
It could have been anybody.

490
00:37:55,772 --> 00:37:59,902
Let's hope God
takes better care of them than we did.

491
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:03,879
You know, there's tragedy everywhere.

492
00:38:03,947 --> 00:38:07,542
This past weekend
it hit so close to home.

493
00:38:07,617 --> 00:38:12,077
That's something you want your family
away from, and that's what I'm trying to do.

494
00:38:12,155 --> 00:38:17,593
Where they don't gotta witness things like
people getting murdered, things like that.

495
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:22,620
I was sitting and thinking
and I asked myself, you know,

496
00:38:22,699 --> 00:38:26,465
what I feel is best for me and my family.

497
00:38:26,536 --> 00:38:29,903
You know, you hear everyone
and, you know, what they got to say,

498
00:38:29,973 --> 00:38:34,137
people, you know, filling your head with...
You gotta be true to yourself.

499
00:38:34,210 --> 00:38:40,115
'Cause if someone believes in me and
I don't, then that doesn't mean anything.

500
00:38:40,183 --> 00:38:43,380
You know, me, personally,
I do think I can play in the NBA.

501
00:38:43,453 --> 00:38:45,478
<i>But I'm still in the projects.</i>

502
00:38:45,555 --> 00:38:48,285
<i>My mother's still gotta struggle</i>
<i>in the projects.</i>

503
00:38:48,358 --> 00:38:50,349
<i>I'm still broke. You know.</i>

504
00:38:50,426 --> 00:38:55,864
<i>So I'm still grounded. Just trying to</i>.
<i>You know... Just waiting for my chance.</i>

505
00:38:57,834 --> 00:39:01,429
<i>(man)</i> A lot of people out here
dying for stupid reasons.

506
00:39:01,504 --> 00:39:05,998
I've seen a lot of people die out here,
close friends' demise.

507
00:39:06,075 --> 00:39:09,067
You know, I used to be a knucklehead
when I was growing up,

508
00:39:09,145 --> 00:39:12,808
so if you get a chance to live, do it.

509
00:39:12,882 --> 00:39:17,615
There's a lot of people that wish they could
sit here and tell a story like I'm telling it.

510
00:39:17,687 --> 00:39:20,087
But they're not.

511
00:39:20,156 --> 00:39:22,556
Out here, basketball saves a lot of us.

512
00:39:22,625 --> 00:39:26,925
A lot of young people will say
it gives you something to do.

513
00:39:26,996 --> 00:39:28,759
Everybody wants to be a baller.

514
00:39:28,831 --> 00:39:33,234
Everybody growing up out here
wants to be an NBA player.

515
00:39:33,303 --> 00:39:36,500
<i>(interviewer)</i> What would life here be like
without basketball?

516
00:39:36,572 --> 00:39:39,871
There won't be no life.
It would be nothing.

517
00:39:40,877 --> 00:39:43,505
There would be nothing out here.

518
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:48,676
I'm calling my man Tick Tick Boom over
'cause he was striving to go to NBA too.

519
00:39:48,751 --> 00:39:51,447
He's still out here,
you know, trying to do his thing.

520
00:39:51,521 --> 00:39:52,954
My man, what's up?

521
00:39:53,022 --> 00:39:55,115
It was fun at school,
but after you get out

522
00:39:55,191 --> 00:39:59,127
and you realize you're not as good
as you wanna be or you thought you was,

523
00:39:59,195 --> 00:40:04,155
it becomes a burden because
you're trying to be the best you could be,

524
00:40:04,233 --> 00:40:07,327
and your best is not what people want.

525
00:40:08,037 --> 00:40:12,497
When it hit me, it was like,
"I'm not gonna get paid for this."

526
00:40:12,575 --> 00:40:16,671
It felt like I'd lost my life.
Basketball was my life.

527
00:40:17,447 --> 00:40:19,881
As you get older,
you know it's just a game.

528
00:40:19,949 --> 00:40:24,249
When you're young, you're thinking this
game's gonna get your mother this house,

529
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,756
get your family out of here. Once you see...
That was the biggest burden.

530
00:40:27,824 --> 00:40:32,523
That's why it's hard to explain, 'cause once
I didn't, I knew my mother'd still be here,

531
00:40:32,595 --> 00:40:36,224
my sister'd still be down there,
my brother'd be over there.

532
00:40:36,299 --> 00:40:40,292
So that was, like, the hardest thing.
I just wasn't doing this for myself.

533
00:40:40,370 --> 00:40:44,966
Then once you fail,
you really feel like you failed your family.

534
00:40:45,441 --> 00:40:48,308
I'm still here.
It's pain.

535
00:40:48,378 --> 00:40:51,973
As long as I'm here, it's pain.
No lie.

536
00:40:52,048 --> 00:40:55,040
As long as I'm here, it's pain.

537
00:41:02,892 --> 00:41:05,793

That was one shot I'll never forget.
That was my first buzzer beater I ever hit.

557
00:44:22,792 --> 00:44:26,728
When you know the NBA's there and
everyone's around, they're looking at you,

558
00:44:26,796 --> 00:44:30,459
they wanna see if you're that player
that they're reading about,

559
00:44:30,533 --> 00:44:34,594
like my brother Dan says,
when the lights is on, it's time to perform.

560
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:36,797
My nigger!

561
00:44:36,872 --> 00:44:41,104
I wasn't expecting to come out and play
well and get the attention that I'm getting.

562
00:44:41,177 --> 00:44:45,170
Not how it's going now. I think it's
a lot better than I thought it would ever go,

563
00:44:45,248 --> 00:44:49,184
but, you know,
it's here and it's happening.

564
00:45:00,363 --> 00:45:02,661
He raised a big stink about it,

565
00:45:02,732 --> 00:45:05,565
and then he said,
"I guess it's taken care of."

566
00:45:05,635 --> 00:45:10,004
'Cause someone showed him the check
and now it's kinda fine.

567
00:45:10,072 --> 00:45:12,597
It was always fine.
He just was attacking me

568
00:45:12,675 --> 00:45:18,739
because he wanted direct communication
with players and I wouldn't give it to him.

569
00:45:18,814 --> 00:45:21,681
I don't know why
people have got hard feelings.

570
00:45:21,751 --> 00:45:26,279
I don't know why people don't think I've
been around. My record speaks for itself.

571
00:45:44,573 --> 00:45:49,510
<i>(Tiny)</i> It's no worse than anybody writing a
story about you that got the facts mixed up.

572
00:45:49,578 --> 00:45:54,072
I don't see no problem. I'm only doing
what I was taught - what was done to me.

573
00:45:54,150 --> 00:45:58,314
When I was coming to high school,
people used to try to recruit people,

574
00:45:58,387 --> 00:46:00,855
or give us free sneakers here and there.

575
00:46:00,923 --> 00:46:04,791
People just blow it up
because I'm winning and I'm young,

576
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:09,092
and I'm not the prototype
high-school coach anymore.

577
00:46:09,165 --> 00:46:15,798
I look like... I dress like, you know, the kids,
because that's my environment.

578
00:46:15,871 --> 00:46:19,705
And if I was put in Wall Street,
I'd look like somebody in Wall Street.

579
00:46:19,775 --> 00:46:24,109
I'm from Coney Island,
so I'm looking like I'm from Coney Island.

580
00:46:28,584 --> 00:46:32,680
There's a lot of people out there
that have got so much negativity to say.

581
00:46:32,755 --> 00:46:34,814
"Oh, he's driving an Escalade."

582
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:37,552
"Oh, his brother wears a diamond watch."

583
00:46:37,626 --> 00:46:39,423
"Dan got a Rolex."

584
00:46:39,495 --> 00:46:44,489
So what? I mean, we all work
and we want nice things too.

585
00:46:45,935 --> 00:46:48,460
When you're dealing with project kids,

586
00:46:48,537 --> 00:46:53,497
we're being fathers, we're big brothers,
sometimes we're even being mothers.

587
00:46:53,576 --> 00:46:57,103
We feed most of these kids every day.

588
00:46:57,179 --> 00:47:02,378
You know, and it's sad
that I had to read that article about Coach.

589
00:47:02,451 --> 00:47:05,579
That hurt me,
because I'm with him all the time,

590
00:47:05,654 --> 00:47:09,090
so I know he don't do
the things they say he's doing.

591
00:47:09,158 --> 00:47:11,490
You know?
I know since my brother's been here,

592
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:15,656
he's protecting my brother
like it was his brother.

593
00:47:15,731 --> 00:47:21,328
So, you know, it's a real situation
that people just don't understand.

594
00:47:29,745 --> 00:47:32,942
Do y'all understand? In the history
of the Public Schools League,

595
00:47:33,015 --> 00:47:36,507
no team has ever won
three straight championships.

596
00:47:36,585 --> 00:47:41,045
Motherfuckers want y'all like...
Y'all are targets.

597
00:47:41,123 --> 00:47:43,819
"One...

598
00:47:43,893 --> 00:47:47,761
"and we done!"

00:47:49,265 --> 00:47:51,927
That's some scary shit, son.

600
00:47:53,002 --> 00:47:56,802
Five games to win the championship.

601
00:47:57,807 --> 00:48:00,935
Don't get nervous on me, son.
He's shaking with nerves.

602
00:48:01,010 --> 00:48:03,740
All the other games we played,
that don't mean shit.

603
00:48:03,813 --> 00:48:07,010
That buzzer beater that he shot?

604
00:48:07,082 --> 00:48:09,983

Nyan and Eugene in the game.

635
00:50:03,499 --> 00:50:05,660
They got two fouls.
They could've got three.

636
00:50:05,734 --> 00:50:10,933
So when I put the subs in the game,
you gotta be very aggressive to score.

637
00:50:11,006 --> 00:50:15,443
'Cause it could be Boetsa, Cardozo.
They got two fouls, first half.

638
00:50:15,511 --> 00:50:20,574
Now I got subs in the game,
and you gotta be very aggressive to score.

639
00:50:20,649 --> 00:50:22,913
- Let's go warm up.
- Let's go, y'all.

640
00:50:22,985 --> 00:50:25,783
You should be on 30 right now.

<i>(Tiny)</i> Do you know who that is?
L.A. Clippers.

642
00:50:30,225 --> 00:50:33,058
One move,
you could fuck everything up.

643
00:50:33,128 --> 00:50:37,792
One bullshit playing around, it gets twisted,
you know what I mean? Don't understand.

644
00:50:37,866 --> 00:50:40,664
Fuck.
Always say something.

a photographer.

He's a genius. This is, like, our third

- Cold and crazy.
- Cold and crazy.

662
00:51:55,911 --> 00:51:57,902
- Good to see you.
- How are you doing?

663
00:51:58,714 --> 00:52:01,842
Oh, shit! Oh!

664
00:52:01,917 --> 00:52:04,613
I thought I was gonna be in the sand.

665
00:52:05,954 --> 00:52:08,855
We're going on the trampoline?
You want me to do flips?

666
00:52:08,924 --> 00:52:12,257
- Yes, I want you up there.
- All right. I know you do.

667

We're all on there, man.
We're all on there.

Keep going, man.
Keep going.

670
00:52:23,806 --> 00:52:26,206
Just be creative.
Just bounce it, man.

671

Oh, shit.

672

If I cut your head off, I'll be crazy.
I love that. Keep doing that.

Oh, yeah. Again.

I'm loving it.

You know, something like that. Just let go.

- Don't worry.

Thank you so much.

00:53:09,585 --> 00:53:12,053
My mother will be so excited.
It's the picture.

You got Coney Island in the background.
You got the smile, so I was very happy.

You're always making sure I smile.

689
00:53:22,297 --> 00:53:25,994
They want to know
if there was any more posters for the team.

690

- Yeah, for his closest friends, like me.

No, but I'll order more if you guys want.
Do you guys want these posters?

- Yes.
- I'll order more. I'll get more.

Because that's him. That's why.

Even when we didn't have nothing,
we were still happy, for some reason.

- A lot of just... Just a lot more.

If he doesn't feel like he's high

750
00:58:40,315 --> 00:58:45,184
and that a potential shoe company
would have a lot of interest in him,

751
00:58:45,253 --> 00:58:48,222
he's coming to Louisville.
So in that regard...

752
00:58:48,290 --> 00:58:52,590
Now, if you ask me my opinion,
my opinion is we better get busy recruiting.

753
00:58:54,362 --> 00:58:59,823
My coach, Rick Pitino, down in Louisville,
someone interviewed him for a paper.

754
00:58:59,901 --> 00:59:03,564
When they asked him about me
and the NBA, he told them what he felt.

755
00:59:03,638 --> 00:59:06,835
You know,
he felt that I'm a top-ten pick, you know,

756
00:59:06,908 --> 00:59:12,005
and I'm maybe gonna play in the NBA,
so that's what he told the papers.

757
00:59:14,116 --> 00:59:17,984
I'm in a barbershop,
getting my hair cut.

758
00:59:18,053 --> 00:59:20,544
I need those cuff links.

759
00:59:20,622 --> 00:59:25,685
I gotta leave in the next 20 minutes.
I got something to do with ESPN today.

760

It don't get no sharper than that.
Yo, are you ready?

761
00:59:40,642 --> 00:59:43,270
I ain't made no decision yet.

762
00:59:43,345 --> 00:59:46,075
Uh, you know,
I think, you know, the NBA, you know...

763
00:59:46,148 --> 00:59:49,049
Me in the NBA, I'm fifty-fifty here.

764
00:59:49,117 --> 00:59:54,054
When they come up and see me, I think
I'm performing the way they want me to.

765
00:59:54,122 --> 00:59:59,321
But I think Louisville
still might be a good place for me.

766
00:59:59,394 --> 01:00:03,831
So we're gonna see. But right now
it's looking real good for the NBA, though.

767
01:00:04,766 --> 01:00:06,996
What up?
There's two pairs in there.

768
01:00:07,068 --> 01:00:12,734
- Yo, get in the back of the car.
- Don't disrespect me. I'll kick this little...

769

for my button-up shirts.

college or NBA or nothing like that?

- "Well, Rick Pitino quoted..."

791
01:01:48,236 --> 01:01:50,204
"Rick Pitino quoted..."

792
01:02:08,056 --> 01:02:12,015
Yo, every fucking day, man.

793
01:02:12,093 --> 01:02:14,755
What the fuck, man?

794
01:02:24,739 --> 01:02:26,730
- How are you doing?
- I'm all right.

795
01:02:26,808 --> 01:02:28,537
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

796
01:02:28,610 --> 01:02:30,737
Six foot and a half inch.

797
01:02:30,812 --> 01:02:36,045
- You're the exact size as Isiah was.
- I'd say I'm six-one.

798
01:02:36,117 --> 01:02:39,712
Exactly the same
as Isiah when he was in high school.

799
01:02:39,788 --> 01:02:42,757
- That's your target. Isiah's your target.
- Isiah?

800
01:02:42,824 --> 01:02:46,055
Down the road, you know.
That's who you wanna be like.

801
01:02:46,127 --> 01:02:49,688
Yeah, I watched a couple of his tapes.
He was good.

802
01:02:49,764 --> 01:02:53,461
The best six-one and under
that ever lived.

803
01:02:54,235 --> 01:02:56,760
- Thanks.
- You got a great handshake.

804
01:02:56,838 --> 01:02:59,602
- Nice firm handshake.
- Oh, yeah.

805
01:02:59,674 --> 01:03:01,141
Good smile.

806
01:03:01,209 --> 01:03:03,336
- Don't lose that, now.
- I won't.

807
01:03:03,411 --> 01:03:06,676
- OK. If you need me, I'm around.
- I know.

808
01:03:11,686 --> 01:03:14,519
I think Sebastian's
going through a whirlwind,

809
01:03:14,589 --> 01:03:17,251
so many things happening at one time.

810
01:03:17,325 --> 01:03:22,627
You know, I think that some of the things
are getting to him, he just ain't saying it.

811
01:03:22,697 --> 01:03:26,531
My brother's about to do something
a lot of people don't get a chance to do.

812
01:03:26,601 --> 01:03:29,536
Sebastian's a special kid.
He's a special kid.

813
01:03:29,604 --> 01:03:33,199
And when we win, 'cause I'm hoping
we win and I'm praying we win,

814
01:03:33,274 --> 01:03:37,233
I want him to stand in the middle of
Madison Square Garden and say, "I did it."

815
01:03:37,312 --> 01:03:40,406
In front of everybody, "I did it."

816
01:03:45,186 --> 01:03:47,586
<i>(Tiny)</i> Damn, look at that line, son.

817
01:03:47,655 --> 01:03:51,455
- <i>(Sebastian)</i> That's the line to get in?
- <i>(all cheer)</i>

818
01:03:56,831 --> 01:04:00,096
- They've come to watch us!
- I'm gonna take a picture.

819
01:04:00,168 --> 01:04:02,033
Yeah!

820

14,000 come to watch us.

821
01:04:04,639 --> 01:04:08,097
Whoo, the lights is on
and we're here!

822
01:04:08,176 --> 01:04:10,838
The lights is on and we're here!

823
01:04:10,912 --> 01:04:16,373
You have never been here. Don't act like
you're at Madison Square Garden. OK?

824
01:04:16,451 --> 01:04:20,114
That means don't come in here
with no scared shit.

825
01:04:21,022 --> 01:04:23,684
Yo!

826
01:04:23,758 --> 01:04:25,658
- Let me hold that, man.
- What's up?

827
01:04:25,727 --> 01:04:28,992
- Hold-hold-hold on.
- Huh?

828
01:04:29,063 --> 01:04:30,826
We're here.
We're here.

829
01:04:30,899 --> 01:04:33,094
I'm back in the gang.

830
01:04:33,168 --> 01:04:35,898
Show him the bullshit moves.

831
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:38,962
# You 'bout to prove my man wrong
I'm gonna play this Vandross

# You gonna take your pants off
I'm gonna play this Gladys Knight

# Me and you gonna get right

834
01:04:44,379 --> 01:04:48,645
I'm happy and having fun, man,
but we got a serious game.

835
01:04:48,716 --> 01:04:51,514
We got a lot of motherfucker
hating us today, yo.

836
01:04:51,586 --> 01:04:54,521
That crowd is not here
to cheer you motherfuckers on.

837
01:04:54,589 --> 01:04:57,422
They're here to see
you motherfuckers go down. Aight?

838

- The lights is on. It's time to perform.
- I got you.

We're here together, man.

<i>Ahead they go for the layup.</i>

<i>And Telfair will be whistled</i>
<i>for that one.</i>

856

Yo, it's over. Forget about it.

They're playing street ball against us.
Outscrapping us.

Bennie, you got zero.
We got one rebound, man.

873

You don't rebound, you're not playing.

You don't rebound, you're not playing.
Plain and simple.

875
01:07:25,540 --> 01:07:28,441
I need rebounds.
I don't need no dunks, no jump shots.

876

"Fuck that, I'm gonna rebound."

950
01:13:30,404 --> 01:13:34,397
<i>Out of Brooklyn</i>.
<i>Telfair signing with Louisville.</i>

951
01:13:37,244 --> 01:13:39,371
Count that assist.

952
01:13:39,447 --> 01:13:41,813
Hey, Coach!
Write that assist down.

953
01:13:42,249 --> 01:13:44,581
Write that assist down.

954
01:13:46,954 --> 01:13:50,412
- Coach, I'm trying to get that assist record.
- I know. Keep working.

955
01:13:50,491 --> 01:13:53,187
Hey, man,
help me get that assist record, man.

956
01:13:53,260 --> 01:13:58,755
- I don't know how many I got.
- I have no idea, but I'll find out.

957
01:13:58,833 --> 01:14:01,165
Run! Run!

958
01:14:05,006 --> 01:14:09,170
<i>(commentator) Dwight Howard</i>
<i>off the great feed from Telfair.</i>

959
01:14:09,643 --> 01:14:13,477
- The record's 13.
- How many you got?

960
01:14:13,547 --> 01:14:16,243
I need four, man.
I need four more.

961
01:14:16,317 --> 01:14:19,514
I'm gonna go back door right now.

962
01:14:20,354 --> 01:14:22,686
I'm there, I'm there.

963
01:14:26,794 --> 01:14:29,354
Jamel, I got you back,
I got you back!

964
01:14:29,430 --> 01:14:31,762
Hit that.
Hit my assist, baby.

965
01:14:38,839 --> 01:14:41,103
I'm gonna go crazy
in that locker room.

966
01:14:41,175 --> 01:14:44,736
You did exactly what you had to do.
Exactly what you had to do, man.

967
01:14:44,812 --> 01:14:49,181
You're a forward general. That was
fantastic. You didn't have to score in this.

968
01:14:49,250 --> 01:14:52,413
That's what everyone was looking for.
I'm so proud of you.

969
01:14:53,621 --> 01:14:55,486
Thank you.

970
01:14:57,858 --> 01:15:00,190
I'll see y'all, man.

971
01:15:04,231 --> 01:15:07,291
You see that man dishing the rock?
That's what it's all about.

972
01:15:07,368 --> 01:15:11,065
I just want to say I had a great time
with all you country boys this weekend.

973
01:15:11,138 --> 01:15:13,038
Wish we could do it again.

974
01:15:13,107 --> 01:15:15,098
You were tremendous,

975
01:15:15,176 --> 01:15:19,203
because you didn't try to do anything
except what you're supposed to do,

976
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:21,214
which is run the team.

977
01:15:21,282 --> 01:15:25,309
You played the way
a true lead guy is supposed to play.

978
01:15:25,386 --> 01:15:27,980
Nobody does that.
Except you.

979
01:15:28,055 --> 01:15:30,819
- 'Cause you're a pro.
- Yeah, I am?

980
01:15:30,891 --> 01:15:32,449
- Yes, you are.
- I hope so.

981
01:15:40,167 --> 01:15:43,694
<i>(Sebastian) When I got home</i>.
<i>I was at meetings till two in the morning.</i>

982
01:15:43,771 --> 01:15:46,535
<i>Just trying to get</i>
<i>the sneaker contract on the roll.</i>

983
01:15:46,607 --> 01:15:51,567
<i>(interviewer)</i> So what happens
when you meet with the sneaker company?

984
01:15:52,980 --> 01:15:55,744
I might as well show you this.

985
01:15:55,816 --> 01:16:01,118
When you go to a sneaker presentation,
they take you through their whole history.

986
01:16:01,188 --> 01:16:04,385
K.G., Tim Duncan,
guys there running, swimming.

987
01:16:04,458 --> 01:16:10,761
And then the last couple of pages is like,
"You are the future."

988
01:16:10,831 --> 01:16:14,597
You know?
Then they got a picture of me.

989
01:16:14,668 --> 01:16:17,102
See those guns right there?

990
01:16:17,171 --> 01:16:23,337
Of course, I'm wearing all Adidas right now.
That's that Adidas camp right there.

991
01:16:23,410 --> 01:16:26,208
And that's me in Adidas,
with my yellow and black colors.

992
01:16:26,280 --> 01:16:28,714
And those'll be
my sneakers right there.

993
01:16:28,782 --> 01:16:32,218
Those'll be the Sebastian Telfairs.

994
01:16:32,286 --> 01:16:35,585
I'm the first person to see this.

995
01:16:35,656 --> 01:16:37,988
No one saw the sneaker yet.

996
01:16:38,058 --> 01:16:41,152
I'm surprised.
I'm like, "Y'all want me?"

997
01:16:42,163 --> 01:16:45,963
"Y'all want to give me a sneaker?"
Things like...

998
01:16:46,967 --> 01:16:52,997
Ah, it's... It's like you see a movie,
and you're picturing that's you,

999
01:16:53,073 --> 01:16:55,132
and you're like,
"That's not reality."

1000
01:16:55,209 --> 01:16:58,235
Then it's really, like, right there.

1001
01:16:58,312 --> 01:17:03,648
I'm sitting talking to these people.
I'm like, "They're talking about me?"

1002
01:17:04,018 --> 01:17:09,081
I'm not dreaming right now.
I was dreaming for the last 18 years.

1003
01:17:09,156 --> 01:17:14,059
Like, it's happening right now.
And it's right in front of me.

1004
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:23,896
Yeah, we're gonna
have to meet anyway.

1005
01:17:23,971 --> 01:17:27,532
Today you got one of the biggest
announcements of your life.

1006
01:17:27,608 --> 01:17:30,600
I'll put my arm round you,
handshake, we'll do a photo op,

1007
01:17:30,678 --> 01:17:33,738
and then I'll back off again
and let you finish your deal.

1008
01:17:33,814 --> 01:17:36,783
The majority of it's gonna be you.

1009
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:42,550
They don't like to hear it from these
corporate guys with the suits on.

1010
01:17:45,593 --> 01:17:49,757
We're gonna head around
the side of the building, so walk with me.

1011
01:17:49,830 --> 01:17:51,821
Right there, where Ron's at.

1012
01:17:55,336 --> 01:17:59,466
How do you want to be introduced?
I mean, do you want Ron to say:

1013
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:01,974
"New York high-school legend"?

1014
01:18:02,042 --> 01:18:06,001
"New York high school legend Sebastian
Telfair to make two announcements"?

1015
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:10,039
How would you personally like
to be kinda brought up to the stage?

1016
01:18:10,117 --> 01:18:11,675
Is there anything?

1017
01:18:11,752 --> 01:18:15,119
You could say "New York City legend,"
anything like that.

1018
01:18:20,427 --> 01:18:25,490
<i>(Ron)</i> And now, Sebastian Telfair,
New York City high-school legend.

1019
01:18:25,566 --> 01:18:27,898
<i>(applause and cheers)</i>

1020
01:18:35,009 --> 01:18:37,239
Thank you.

1021
01:18:38,379 --> 01:18:41,712
Thanks for coming, everybody.

1022
01:18:41,782 --> 01:18:45,274
I got a couple of announcements to make.

1023
01:18:45,352 --> 01:18:51,655
The first announcement is,
I'm the newest member of the Adidas team.

1024
01:18:51,725 --> 01:18:54,159
I'm gonna be signing with Adidas.

1025
01:19:00,901 --> 01:19:04,462
- <i>(man)</i> All right! That's good!
- <i>(applause)</i>

1026
01:19:07,741 --> 01:19:12,405
And now, every one of you really
came here to hear the announcement -

1027
01:19:12,479 --> 01:19:16,176
I will be entering the 2004 NBA draft.

1028
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:18,582
<i>(applause)</i>

1029
01:19:24,825 --> 01:19:28,317
He brings that instant street credibility.
And so we're gonna...

1030
01:19:28,395 --> 01:19:31,159
- Instant what?
- Instant street credibility.

1031
01:19:31,231 --> 01:19:35,224
So street cred with the real urban ballers,
with the ballers,

1032
01:19:35,302 --> 01:19:37,395
so we're pretty excited about that too.

1033
01:19:37,471 --> 01:19:40,099
<i>(woman) How do you plan</i>
<i>on using the college funds?</i>

1034
01:19:40,174 --> 01:19:44,543
<i>(Tiny) He's gonna probably go</i>
<i>somewhere and work out on his game.</i>

1035
01:19:44,611 --> 01:19:48,479
<i>And the world he's about to embark on</i>
<i>is gonna be so difficult.</i>

1036
01:19:48,549 --> 01:19:53,043
He's still got a lotta learning to do.
A whole lotta learning.

1037
01:19:53,120 --> 01:19:55,520
Specially when you got money now.

1038
01:19:55,589 --> 01:20:01,824
Now it's really easy to mess up now,
because you're financially fit.

1039
01:20:02,830 --> 01:20:06,266
Everything you wish for, you got.
Now what you gonna do?

1040
01:20:06,333 --> 01:20:09,996
You wished for a car,
a house for your mother - you got it.

1041
01:20:10,070 --> 01:20:12,732
You wished for your own sneakers -
you got it.

1042
01:20:12,806 --> 01:20:15,366
Now, what is your intention in life now?

1043
01:20:15,442 --> 01:20:19,037
I want him to really realize
that he's about to be a man,

1044
01:20:19,113 --> 01:20:21,581
in a crazy business.

1045
01:20:23,150 --> 01:20:25,482
He's gonna go to a company.

1046
01:20:26,720 --> 01:20:30,178
And he's gonna be
the rookie of the company.

1047
01:20:31,759 --> 01:20:36,196
And nobody gonna care
who Sebastian Telfair is no more.

1048
01:20:58,085 --> 01:21:01,987
Now Sebastian Telfair is going
straight from high school to the NBA.

1049
01:21:02,055 --> 01:21:06,321
It's one thing to be LeBron James,
or Kobe Bryant, or Kevin Garnett,

1050
01:21:06,393 --> 01:21:10,261
it's quite another to be five-ten like Telfair,
with a spotty jump shot.

1051
01:21:20,240 --> 01:21:25,906
It's exactly
2:58 in the morning back home.

1052
01:21:26,914 --> 01:21:29,439
And we're going for our first workout.

1053
01:21:29,516 --> 01:21:33,680
So when I get up,
we'll be going to our second workout.

1054
01:21:33,754 --> 01:21:35,187
Focus.

1055
01:21:35,255 --> 01:21:39,453
<i>(Jamel)</i> That's the reason why I got him
out here in Greece. Just to clear his head.

1056
01:21:39,526 --> 01:21:43,462
When I was back home,
I saw, like, a confused boy.

1057
01:21:43,530 --> 01:21:47,227
And I didn't like what I saw.
He was too Hollywood, you know.

1058
01:21:47,301 --> 01:21:49,030
It's good to be in the limelight,

1059
01:21:49,102 --> 01:21:53,232
but sometimes you forget what you have
to do, you know, to stay in that limelight.

1060
01:21:53,307 --> 01:21:58,404
So he gotta do this other
hard construction work over here.

1061
01:22:11,892 --> 01:22:15,851
Little faster, little faster, little faster.
There you go.

1062
01:22:15,929 --> 01:22:17,396
Ah. Ah!

1063
01:22:17,464 --> 01:22:20,456
Five dribbles.
No six dribbles. Five dribbles.

1064
01:22:40,621 --> 01:22:43,784
Know you're gonna make the shot.
Never second-guess your shot.

1065
01:22:43,857 --> 01:22:46,519
Second guess is
don't fucking shoot.

1066
01:22:47,961 --> 01:22:52,421
You know how when we used to go work
out, and we didn't have no cars or nothing.

1067
01:22:52,499 --> 01:22:55,525
You know, we'd have to go
borrow people's cars to go work out.

1068
01:22:55,602 --> 01:22:58,537
We'd be the best people in the gym,
even the NBA players,

1069
01:22:58,605 --> 01:23:01,802
and we didn't have
no vehicle to get around.

1070
01:23:01,875 --> 01:23:07,404
Well, I just signed my Adidas deal
and I just bought my brother a 645Ci.

1071
01:23:07,481 --> 01:23:12,145
Brand-new BMW. I don't know where
it is yet, y'all know when y'all see it.

1072
01:23:12,219 --> 01:23:15,985
Soon as we get back to the States,
I'm gonna give it to him.

1073
01:23:16,056 --> 01:23:19,548
I ain't seen it yet.
I know how it looks, but I just ordered it.

1074
01:23:19,626 --> 01:23:22,789
We get home the second.
It's, like, the 20-something right now.

1075
01:23:22,863 --> 01:23:26,856
So soon as we get home I'm gonna
give it to him. I know he's gonna go crazy.

1076
01:23:26,934 --> 01:23:28,367
Shh!

1077
01:23:35,208 --> 01:23:37,574
<i>(shopkeeper)</i> How are you?

1078
01:23:38,812 --> 01:23:41,144
<i>(Jamel)</i> That's really sweet, right?

1079
01:23:42,382 --> 01:23:44,714
Are you trying it on?

1080
01:23:47,654 --> 01:23:50,054
How's it feel?
Is it all right?

1081
01:23:51,725 --> 01:23:54,592
- <i>(shopkeeper)</i> You like it?
- Yeah, I like it.

1082
01:23:57,864 --> 01:24:01,664
- I like that one right there.
- Nah, that's... That's...

1083
01:24:01,735 --> 01:24:04,829
You gotta be grown for that.
You gotta be at least 23.

1084
01:24:04,905 --> 01:24:08,932
- That's real gold, man.
- I let y'all play my budget.

1085
01:24:09,009 --> 01:24:13,605
- No, no. We buy expensive.
- <i>(shopkeeper)</i> Yes, I know.

1086
01:24:13,680 --> 01:24:16,615
<i>(Jamel)</i> That's about 18?
18 thousand?

1087
01:24:16,683 --> 01:24:19,447
- <i>(Sebastian)</i> That's what I want.
- Not one diamond.

1088
01:24:40,974 --> 01:24:43,499
<i>(man) Why are</i>
<i>so many high-school players moving?</i>

1089
01:24:43,577 --> 01:24:45,477
<i>Because we have a deluded draft pool.</i>

1090
01:24:45,545 --> 01:24:49,174
<i>Sebastian Telfair is a young man</i>
<i>who I think may be making a mistake.</i>

1091
01:24:49,249 --> 01:24:53,242
<i>He is not a lottery-type player.</i>
<i>He is small. He does not shoot the ball.</i>

1092
01:24:53,320 --> 01:24:55,515
<i>And I think</i>
<i>he could struggle in the league.</i>

1093
01:25:22,549 --> 01:25:24,210
Oh, fuck.

1094
01:25:24,284 --> 01:25:28,414
Step off the line, man. Stop getting
frustrated the whole fucking time.

1095
01:25:36,797 --> 01:25:41,427
Ah, damn. Ten fucking shots
and I didn't make a fucking...

1096
01:25:44,638 --> 01:25:45,627
Fuck!

1097
01:25:45,706 --> 01:25:48,607
Can't make a shot, man.
I missed the last 20 shots, man.

1098
01:25:48,675 --> 01:25:51,508
- Fucking...
- Well, make 'em, then. Shit. Make 'em.

1099
01:25:51,578 --> 01:25:55,742
Fix the shot. You're a pro, fix your shot.
Fix your shot.

1100
01:25:56,717 --> 01:26:01,154
There you go. Shoot like a pro, man.
There you go.

1101
01:26:02,589 --> 01:26:05,683
Back down. Back down.

1102
01:26:05,759 --> 01:26:09,456
<i>(Jamel)</i> Pull him, Drew. Pull him, Drew.

seeing where he's gonna be in the draft,

you know, and hoping
that everything works out right.

1111
01:27:04,284 --> 01:27:09,586
And my mother, she's scared because my
brother Jamel been through a lot of stuff.

1112
01:27:09,656 --> 01:27:13,683
She's scared. Even after the Adidas
contract and everything, she's still scared.

1113
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:16,991
She always talks about,
"I just don't want them to hurt my baby."

1114
01:27:17,063 --> 01:27:19,122
Jamel's saying...
He's the same way.

1115
01:27:19,199 --> 01:27:22,726
Like, "I just don't want to hurt him.
I just don't want them to hurt him."

He gotta prove everybody wrong.

Everybody said he was too small,
he couldn't do this, couldn't do that.

1141
01:33:07,447 --> 01:33:14,410
Now look at us. Kid from Coney Island,
about to be in the draft. Making it.

- Nah, she can't do that no more.
- No, because I'm getting a cook.

We're gonna have a cook. So y'all

# Stay at it till I'm tapping
on the door of success

1259
01:42:20,599 --> 01:42:23,727
# More or less I never rest
until I'm gasping for breath

1260
01:42:23,803 --> 01:42:25,862
# And I won't stop till I drop

1261
01:42:25,938 --> 01:42:28,566
# Knowing most times in life
you only get one shot

# Going all out for me,
my family, and my team

1263
01:42:31,677 --> 01:42:34,202
# Their love got me through the fire,
know what I mean?

- # Without a doubt

1265
01:42:36,982 --> 01:42:39,382
# Yo, who's the player
they be talking about?

1266
01:42:39,452 --> 01:42:42,148
- # Brooklyn turned it out
- # Without a doubt

1267
01:42:42,221 --> 01:42:44,849
# Look, I'm the player they be talking about

1268
01:42:44,924 --> 01:42:47,518
- # Brooklyn turned it out
- # Without a doubt

1269
01:42:47,593 --> 01:42:51,359
# Look, who's the player
they be talking about?
