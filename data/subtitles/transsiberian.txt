1
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,948
C'mon, finish up!

2
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,985
Good morning, Detective Grinko.

3
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:49,471
Fuck!

4
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,781
Investigating officer?

5
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,108
What happened here?

6
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:57,100
Somebody did us a huge favor.

7
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,706
I asked the investigating officer!

8
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,310
An armed robbery?

9
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:04,665
Explain.

10
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,642
The victim, Nozim Kalandarov, ...

11
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,869
... a small dealer in Rukshan's gang.

12
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,086
The perpetrator took him by surprise, ...

13
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:21,566
... stabed him in the cranium and
injured himself while doing so.

14
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,940
And the drugs?

15
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:27,429
Gone. Stolen.

16
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,271
The Tajiki gang made another hit
on Rukschan's delivery.

17
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,624
The drugs are probably arriving
in Hakkaido by now.

18
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:43,503
Good job!

19
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:49,206
I want a detailed reoprt. I am leaving on
a business trip this evening, understood?

20
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,586
Understood.

21
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:23,223
- Clean sheets?
- No, thanks...

22
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,506
How much?

23
00:07:38,988 --> 00:07:40,008
One tea, here you are!

24
00:07:40,012 --> 00:07:41,432
Take it, take your tea!

25
00:07:41,436 --> 00:07:44,256
What's that stupid look on your face?!
You want tea and I made it for you!

26
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,780
This is not part of my job and
can't you see that I have no time at all?

27
00:07:46,784 --> 00:07:48,504
You immature weirdo!

28
00:07:48,508 --> 00:07:50,508
Fucking moron!

29
00:08:18,447 --> 00:08:23,347
Please stay in your seats.
This is just a routine check.

30
00:12:13,275 --> 00:12:15,875
What you got there?
Let's see...

31
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,300
Oh, yeah!
That's what I like...

32
00:12:49,524 --> 00:12:51,824
That's what I need...

33
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:49,709
- Hey, hey, cheers!
- Cheers! - C'mon, c'mon! Cheers!

34
00:19:02,615 --> 00:19:03,315
Yes, yes, yes! ...

35
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,950
The gulag?!

36
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:26,222
- You fucking bastard!
- You bastard!

37
00:21:27,246 --> 00:21:28,946
... Bastard!

38
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:52,669
Fuck me! ...

39
00:22:03,273 --> 00:22:05,073
Fuck me!

40
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,400
What lovely pictures!

41
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:31,583
Those Polacks are a real nuisance...

42
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,904
You see?

43
00:33:02,614 --> 00:33:03,914
What's going on?!

44
00:33:03,938 --> 00:33:07,038
I cannot for once wash my ass here
without being disturbed?!

45
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,520
Where are you going like that, sweetheart?

46
00:35:55,785 --> 00:35:58,585
So you have no American guest there?

47
00:35:59,085 --> 00:36:00,285
No, it's okay.

48
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,550
Hello?

49
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,250
I cannot hear you! ...

50
00:36:54,594 --> 00:36:55,794
Only this.

51
00:37:20,519 --> 00:37:22,119
Thanks!

52
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,588
Hypocrite!

53
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:54,147
... sensations?

54
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:31,588
Good night!

55
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,108
- Thanks!
- Not at all.

56
00:41:43,490 --> 00:41:45,390
- Where the fuck are they?!
- What's this?

57
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:47,190
Where are the drugs?!

58
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:51,090
Where are the fucking drugs?!
Where are they, you fuck?!

59
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,000
What are you looking at?!

60
00:42:39,337 --> 00:42:41,037
Good, what now?

61
00:43:49,911 --> 00:43:51,511
Let's go!

62
00:48:16,840 --> 00:48:18,422
Gorgeous, eh?

63
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,586
Fucking shit!

64
00:51:33,740 --> 00:51:34,787
Come here!

65
00:59:13,915 --> 00:59:15,315
Finally!

66
00:59:47,647 --> 00:59:48,899
Cheers!

67
01:03:34,735 --> 01:03:35,835
Good night!

68
01:05:46,364 --> 01:05:48,284
<i>Open up!
What's going on?</i>

69
01:05:48,288 --> 01:05:49,908
Hey, you in there!

70
01:05:51,912 --> 01:05:54,032
Open the door! I am talking to you!
What's this noise?!

71
01:05:54,036 --> 01:05:56,219
What's going on in there?!

72
01:06:30,355 --> 01:06:32,355
Jesus! What are you doing there!

73
01:09:55,220 --> 01:09:56,267
Yes?

74
01:12:06,780 --> 01:12:08,380
Get outta here!

75
01:15:53,180 --> 01:15:54,261
Yes.

76
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:37,785
Good night!

77
01:22:10,710 --> 01:22:14,310
Kolzak, please...
There is no need for that.

78
01:22:58,060 --> 01:22:59,184
Yes...

79
01:28:44,780 --> 01:28:46,027
She's lying.

80
01:28:46,220 --> 01:28:49,030
She knows where he is.
- She'll talk.

81
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:52,822
- I need to talk to Rukshan first.
- You are wasting time, Ilya!

82
01:28:53,220 --> 01:28:54,660
Shoot the husband...

83
01:28:54,660 --> 01:28:57,566
... in the head. She'll talk.

84
01:28:58,140 --> 01:29:03,223
- They are Americans.
- This all happened on your watch...

85
01:29:03,320 --> 01:29:06,920
Need I remind you what Rukshan will do,

86
01:29:06,920 --> 01:29:10,806
... if you don't find his money?

87
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:15,867
Give them five minutes.

88
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:19,906
And then shoot him in the knee.

89
01:31:03,930 --> 01:31:05,530
Come here...

90
01:33:00,454 --> 01:33:02,454
What the fuck is this!

91
01:35:23,676 --> 01:35:25,376
Kolzak!

92
01:35:25,377 --> 01:35:26,677
No!

93
01:36:11,620 --> 01:36:12,548
Brace!

94
01:36:13,140 --> 01:36:14,402
Brace!
Brace!

95
01:36:54,280 --> 01:36:55,770
I don't believe her.

96
01:36:57,580 --> 01:36:59,150
I don't believe her!

97
01:37:17,420 --> 01:37:18,626
No.

98
01:37:19,020 --> 01:37:20,067
Give it to me...

99
01:37:22,580 --> 01:37:24,025
Give it to me!

100
01:37:44,420 --> 01:37:49,105
- Let go of your weapon!
- I'm a police officer! I'm a police officer!

101
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:56,500
- What the heck is going on here?
- Ilya Grinko, Federal Drug Control Service.

102
01:37:56,500 --> 01:37:59,067
I just saved these hostages.

103
01:37:59,500 --> 01:38:01,590
They are Americans.

104
01:38:02,020 --> 01:38:05,780
This is Kolzak Yushenkov.
He kidnapped the tourists ...

105
01:38:05,780 --> 01:38:09,720
... and hijacked the train... Fortunately,
I was able to jump on just in time ...

106
01:38:09,720 --> 01:38:12,302
... and prevent the worst from happening.

107
01:38:16,700 --> 01:38:18,245
Put down your weapons.

108
01:38:19,180 --> 01:38:20,745
Go help those people.

109
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:30,731
- You have many injured?
- On the contrary!

110
01:38:30,820 --> 01:38:33,061
They are pretty much enjoying it
to be here.

111
01:38:33,460 --> 01:38:36,987
A day here is a day less in Grozny!

112
01:38:40,380 --> 01:38:41,927
What is she saying to me?

113
01:38:42,420 --> 01:38:44,342
Ggibberish...
I have no idea.
