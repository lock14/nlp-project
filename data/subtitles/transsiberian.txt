C'mon, finish up!



Good morning, Detective Grinko.



Fuck!



Investigating officer?



What happened here?



Somebody did us a huge favor.



I asked the investigating officer!



An armed robbery?



Explain.



The victim, Nozim Kalandarov, ...



... a small dealer in Rukshan's gang.



The perpetrator took him by surprise, ...



... stabed him in the cranium and
injured himself while doing so.



And the drugs?



Gone. Stolen.



The Tajiki gang made another hit
on Rukschan's delivery.



The drugs are probably arriving
in Hakkaido by now.



Good job!



I want a detailed reoprt. I am leaving on
a business trip this evening, understood?



Understood.



- Clean sheets?
- No, thanks...



How much?



One tea, here you are!



Take it, take your tea!



What's that stupid look on your face?!
You want tea and I made it for you!



This is not part of my job and
can't you see that I have no time at all?



You immature weirdo!



Fucking moron!



Please stay in your seats.
This is just a routine check.



What you got there?
Let's see...



Oh, yeah!
That's what I like...



That's what I need...



- Hey, hey, cheers!
- Cheers! - C'mon, c'mon! Cheers!



Yes, yes, yes! ...



The gulag?!



- You fucking bastard!
- You bastard!



... Bastard!



Fuck me! ...



Fuck me!



What lovely pictures!



Those Polacks are a real nuisance...



You see?



What's going on?!



I cannot for once wash my ass here
without being disturbed?!



Where are you going like that, sweetheart?



So you have no American guest there?



No, it's okay.



Hello?



I cannot hear you! ...



Only this.



Thanks!



Hypocrite!



... sensations?



Good night!



- Thanks!
- Not at all.



- Where the fuck are they?!
- What's this?



Where are the drugs?!



Where are the fucking drugs?!
Where are they, you fuck?!



What are you looking at?!



Good, what now?



Let's go!



Gorgeous, eh?



Fucking shit!



Come here!



Finally!



Cheers!



Good night!



<i>Open up!
What's going on?</i>



Hey, you in there!



Open the door! I am talking to you!
What's this noise?!



What's going on in there?!



Jesus! What are you doing there!



Yes?



Get outta here!



Yes.



Good night!



Kolzak, please...
There is no need for that.



Yes...



She's lying.



She knows where he is.
- She'll talk.



- I need to talk to Rukshan first.
- You are wasting time, Ilya!



Shoot the husband...



... in the head. She'll talk.



- They are Americans.
- This all happened on your watch...



Need I remind you what Rukshan will do,



... if you don't find his money?



Give them five minutes.



And then shoot him in the knee.



Come here...



What the fuck is this!



Kolzak!



No!



Brace!



Brace!
Brace!



I don't believe her.



I don't believe her!



No.



Give it to me...



Give it to me!



- Let go of your weapon!
- I'm a police officer! I'm a police officer!



- What the heck is going on here?
- Ilya Grinko, Federal Drug Control Service.



I just saved these hostages.



They are Americans.



This is Kolzak Yushenkov.
He kidnapped the tourists ...



... and hijacked the train... Fortunately,
I was able to jump on just in time ...



... and prevent the worst from happening.



Put down your weapons.



Go help those people.



- You have many injured?
- On the contrary!



They are pretty much enjoying it
to be here.



A day here is a day less in Grozny!



What is she saying to me?



Ggibberish...
I have no idea.
