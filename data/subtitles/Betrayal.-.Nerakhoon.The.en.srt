00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:50,271
BETRAYAL

7
00:02:24,198 --> 00:02:25,472
Here you go.

8
00:02:26,078 --> 00:02:28,397
Please take off your clothes.

9
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:31,268
- All of them?
- Above your waist.

10
00:02:33,958 --> 00:02:36,677
Have you ever had a
prophylactic examination?

11
00:02:36,678 --> 00:02:37,872
No.

12
00:02:39,518 --> 00:02:41,698
Have you been here before?

13
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:46,907
What for? I'm OK.

14
00:02:47,438 --> 00:02:48,868
Lay down, please.

15
00:02:56,798 --> 00:02:59,868
Keep still,
the charge is very weak.

16
00:03:00,358 --> 00:03:03,797
- I just don't like to be...
- Touched by a stranger?

17
00:03:03,798 --> 00:03:06,178
Many people don't like that.

18
00:03:10,398 --> 00:03:11,877
Any complaints?

19
00:03:12,318 --> 00:03:13,512
No.

20
00:03:14,478 --> 00:03:15,627
Your heart?

21
00:03:16,318 --> 00:03:17,353
It's OK.

22
00:03:21,438 --> 00:03:24,918
I haven't been feeling
too good lately...

23
00:03:27,598 --> 00:03:28,792
Why?

24
00:03:31,278 --> 00:03:34,278
My husband has been
cheating on me.

25
00:03:34,798 --> 00:03:36,828
I'm sorry to hear that.

26
00:03:39,758 --> 00:03:42,408
He cheats on me with your wife.

27
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:35,229
I don't get it. Why?

28
00:04:35,998 --> 00:04:37,488
What do you mean?

29
00:04:37,558 --> 00:04:38,877
Why tell me?

30
00:04:41,518 --> 00:04:43,358
Because you came here.

31
00:04:43,598 --> 00:04:45,428
I came for a checkup.

32
00:04:46,318 --> 00:04:48,488
That's how it usually is.

33
00:04:48,678 --> 00:04:51,877
Someone lives a peaceful life,
thinks he's healthy.

34
00:04:51,878 --> 00:04:55,698
Then he comes in for
a routine checkup and...

35
00:04:56,878 --> 00:04:58,311
That's not true.

36
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:53,668
I'm glad I met you.

37
00:05:54,158 --> 00:05:55,227
Good-bye.

38
00:06:57,238 --> 00:06:58,238
Easy, easy.

39
00:06:58,278 --> 00:06:59,557
Are you OK, man?

40
00:06:59,558 --> 00:07:00,558
I'm OK.

41
00:07:00,998 --> 00:07:02,498
Somebody call 911!

42
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,550
Call 911!

43
00:07:06,398 --> 00:07:07,548
Does it hurt?

44
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,508
Will somebody call 911?

45
00:08:08,038 --> 00:08:11,228
- Yes?
- It's me. I've lost my keys.

46
00:08:30,198 --> 00:08:31,756
What's wrong?

47
00:08:32,318 --> 00:08:33,353
Nothing.

48
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:36,088
I can tell something's wrong.

49
00:08:36,838 --> 00:08:39,877
- Where were you?
- We had a medical checkup.

50
00:08:39,878 --> 00:08:40,878
And?

51
00:08:41,558 --> 00:08:43,678
Have they found something?

52
00:08:44,238 --> 00:08:45,248
What is it?

53
00:08:47,278 --> 00:08:48,711
What is it?

54
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:50,227
Nothing.

55
00:08:51,358 --> 00:08:52,757
You scared me.

56
00:08:53,918 --> 00:08:55,748
Are you going to eat?

57
00:08:57,278 --> 00:09:00,997
We're out of white bread.
Is that all right?

58
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:04,157
A woman in our office is
selling a parcel of land.

59
00:09:04,158 --> 00:09:08,258
The foundations already done.
And it's cheap too.

60
00:09:09,638 --> 00:09:11,557
You want to build a cottage?

61
00:09:11,558 --> 00:09:16,237
You told me yourself it would
be great to have a country house.

62
00:09:16,238 --> 00:09:17,957
Have you changed your mind?

63
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:22,388
We could go there on weekends
to get some fresh air.

64
00:09:22,398 --> 00:09:24,717
- But you work on weekends.
- Not every weekend.

65
00:09:24,718 --> 00:09:26,957
I know the soil there is good,
I've made inquiries...

66
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,077
I could plant cherry trees,
some raspberry bushes.

67
00:09:30,078 --> 00:09:32,637
My grandmother used
to grow raspberries...

68
00:09:32,638 --> 00:09:35,428
Could you help me for once today?

69
00:09:43,118 --> 00:09:45,988
- I saw an accident today.
- What?

70
00:09:46,358 --> 00:09:47,871
An accident.

71
00:09:50,238 --> 00:09:52,437
A SUV crashed
into a bus stop full of people.

72
00:09:52,438 --> 00:09:53,798
That's terrible.

73
00:09:54,118 --> 00:09:56,368
Have you washed your hands?

74
00:09:58,358 --> 00:10:00,957
I left the bus stop
a minute before it happened.

75
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:01,958
Really?

76
00:10:02,278 --> 00:10:04,508
Yes, only a minute before.

77
00:10:08,758 --> 00:10:13,798
Now I see why I've had an eerie
premonition all day long...

78
00:10:18,558 --> 00:10:21,197
Can you stop grabbing food?

79
00:10:23,078 --> 00:10:24,438
That's terrible.

80
00:10:25,398 --> 00:10:27,036
Any victims?

81
00:10:28,398 --> 00:10:29,626
Yes.

82
00:10:30,438 --> 00:10:34,989
Three people
have died, I think.

83
00:11:32,918 --> 00:11:34,818
Give me a hand please.

84
00:11:41,838 --> 00:11:44,597
I can't stop thinking
about that crash.

85
00:11:44,598 --> 00:11:45,713
How awful.

86
00:11:46,518 --> 00:11:49,458
Somebody is not going
home tonight.

87
00:12:03,158 --> 00:12:05,672
I need to tell you something.

88
00:12:08,598 --> 00:12:12,068
Promise me
you won't fly off the handle.

89
00:12:14,238 --> 00:12:15,238
Go ahead.

90
00:12:15,518 --> 00:12:16,951
Promise?

91
00:12:18,838 --> 00:12:20,191
Go ahead.

92
00:12:22,838 --> 00:12:25,432
He got five F's this term.

93
00:12:26,238 --> 00:12:28,418
He's been flunking school.

94
00:12:28,878 --> 00:12:32,348
He's flunked
about two months.

95
00:12:32,878 --> 00:12:38,448
I've no idea why. He won't tell me.
Maybe you could talk to him?

96
00:12:39,798 --> 00:12:42,312
Stop it! Please don't!

97
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:52,997
Hush now...
Don't cry.

98
00:12:53,998 --> 00:12:56,034
Daddy loves you.

99
00:13:20,118 --> 00:13:21,748
You shouldn't have.

100
00:13:24,398 --> 00:13:26,838
You didn't even ask him why.

101
00:13:43,878 --> 00:13:45,550
Are you OK?

102
00:13:48,358 --> 00:13:49,677
What is it?

103
00:13:53,238 --> 00:13:55,194
What is it?

104
00:13:56,238 --> 00:13:58,035
What's the matter?

105
00:13:59,718 --> 00:14:01,595
What's the matter?

106
00:14:23,038 --> 00:14:26,108
- Everything's OK.
- I'm not crying.

107
00:14:47,558 --> 00:14:49,549
- What?
- Nothing.

108
00:15:23,118 --> 00:15:25,158
Why aren't you sleeping?

109
00:15:25,398 --> 00:15:26,398
I see.

110
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:45,789
Good night.

111
00:16:46,278 --> 00:16:47,677
Good night.

112
00:17:06,518 --> 00:17:08,278
It's stuffy in here.

113
00:17:09,118 --> 00:17:10,478
Open the window.

114
00:17:13,398 --> 00:17:14,911
Wort help.

115
00:18:38,918 --> 00:18:40,558
Please wait outside.

116
00:18:40,798 --> 00:18:42,148
You lied to me.

117
00:18:48,158 --> 00:18:50,128
Why are you doing this?

118
00:18:58,398 --> 00:19:00,028
Please have a look.

119
00:19:15,878 --> 00:19:17,088
It's not her.

120
00:19:17,198 --> 00:19:20,178
OK, it's not her.
You can go now.

121
00:19:22,758 --> 00:19:25,113
I have a busy day today.

122
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,997
Could you give me something
for my heart?

123
00:19:34,998 --> 00:19:36,511
I feel pressure.

124
00:19:37,158 --> 00:19:38,796
It's the weather.

125
00:19:43,118 --> 00:19:44,631
I have a son.

126
00:19:45,678 --> 00:19:48,397
He's started flunking school.

127
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:53,678
- I lost my temper yesterday and...
- I'm not interested.

128
00:19:55,598 --> 00:19:56,713
Why?

129
00:19:57,198 --> 00:20:00,997
Not interested, and that's all.
I'm too busy.

130
00:20:00,998 --> 00:20:02,750
Do you have kids?

131
00:20:03,838 --> 00:20:05,066
- No.
- No?

132
00:20:06,518 --> 00:20:08,110
Why?

133
00:20:08,918 --> 00:20:10,715
Your husband can't...

134
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:13,938
Let me guess. He's impotent.

135
00:20:15,758 --> 00:20:19,910
Your wife cheats on you!
She's with him now!

136
00:20:21,758 --> 00:20:24,517
- They... They have switched off
their phones!  - Quiet!

137
00:20:24,518 --> 00:20:28,938
He never used to switch it off!
She's with him now!

138
00:20:29,198 --> 00:20:34,147
She's with him now!
They're both naked!

139
00:21:07,118 --> 00:21:10,318
Your heart is fine.
It's the weather.

140
00:21:27,478 --> 00:21:29,648
What do you want from me?

141
00:21:31,718 --> 00:21:33,276
Nothing.

142
00:22:05,798 --> 00:22:08,458
This is where they usually meet.

143
00:22:48,638 --> 00:22:50,276
Their bench.

144
00:22:50,518 --> 00:22:55,467
Last time,
they sat here for two hours.

145
00:23:28,878 --> 00:23:32,597
My husband usually orders tea.
Your wife takes a double espresso.

146
00:23:32,598 --> 00:23:36,618
They share a cheese plate
and a bottle of wine.

147
00:23:48,238 --> 00:23:50,218
She likes strong coffee.

148
00:23:51,318 --> 00:23:54,435
Isn't it bad for the heart?

149
00:23:55,038 --> 00:23:57,917
Womers hearts are stronger.

150
00:23:57,918 --> 00:24:00,797
They are surrounded by fat,
and they beat faster than mers.

151
00:24:00,798 --> 00:24:01,867
Why?

152
00:24:02,558 --> 00:24:03,991
We bear children.

153
00:24:04,438 --> 00:24:07,368
Our hearts have got to be stronger.

154
00:24:09,398 --> 00:24:13,208
You should go home,
you don't look too good.

155
00:24:18,118 --> 00:24:19,598
I don't want to.

156
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:46,836
They take this room every time.

157
00:24:47,358 --> 00:24:50,270
Seventh floor, nice view.

158
00:25:59,678 --> 00:26:04,048
If the room's taken, they
never rent a different one.

159
00:26:04,478 --> 00:26:06,708
They take a walk instead.

160
00:26:13,278 --> 00:26:19,278
Once, they were downstairs, in the sauna,
then were swimming in the pool.

161
00:31:49,718 --> 00:31:51,758
What are you doing here?

162
00:31:53,998 --> 00:31:54,998
And you?

163
00:31:55,198 --> 00:31:57,928
We're discussing the real estate.

164
00:31:58,638 --> 00:32:00,276
Husband?

165
00:32:01,118 --> 00:32:02,878
How did you find me?

166
00:32:03,478 --> 00:32:06,517
I... Came here to find out
how much the room costs.

167
00:32:06,518 --> 00:32:08,237
A friend asked me to.

168
00:32:08,238 --> 00:32:10,557
- What for?
- What can I get you?

169
00:32:10,558 --> 00:32:13,237
- Green tea, please.
- I'll have juice.

170
00:32:13,238 --> 00:32:16,128
- Coffee, please.
- Double espresso?

171
00:32:16,518 --> 00:32:18,957
He seems to be aware
of how you like your coffee.

172
00:32:18,958 --> 00:32:22,877
Let us finish, OK?
We were in the middle of something.

173
00:32:22,878 --> 00:32:28,758
- Tell me about that property.
- It's quite big, the location is quiet.

174
00:32:30,278 --> 00:32:36,278
Nice neighbors. Faces the forest, some
nice lakes are 5 minutes' walk away.

175
00:32:47,358 --> 00:32:50,917
I'm just interested what
you were doing there.

176
00:32:50,918 --> 00:32:52,818
I've already told you.

177
00:32:53,518 --> 00:32:56,197
Why couldn't your friend
find out for himself?

178
00:32:56,198 --> 00:32:58,158
By the way, who is it?

179
00:32:58,838 --> 00:33:00,669
I can't tell you.

180
00:33:01,278 --> 00:33:05,028
He's having an affair.
With a married woman.

181
00:33:05,838 --> 00:33:08,148
They have no place to meet.

182
00:33:08,798 --> 00:33:10,838
And you are helping him?

183
00:33:23,678 --> 00:33:25,837
They really love each other.

184
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:28,548
Why can't you tell me his name?

185
00:33:29,078 --> 00:33:30,358
Do I know him?

186
00:33:30,478 --> 00:33:32,196
No, you don't.

187
00:33:34,118 --> 00:33:38,191
Tell me, in all honesty.
Are you seeing someone?

188
00:33:45,238 --> 00:33:46,910
Are you serious?

189
00:33:47,598 --> 00:33:48,713
Yes.

190
00:33:51,158 --> 00:33:52,637
No, I'm not.

191
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:56,517
Are you?

192
00:33:57,758 --> 00:33:59,589
Am I?

193
00:34:09,798 --> 00:34:14,667
- Sorry, I didn't mean it.
- You really hurt my feelings.

194
00:34:15,198 --> 00:34:16,313
Listen.

195
00:34:17,558 --> 00:34:18,397
I didn't mean it.

196
00:34:18,398 --> 00:34:24,258
I work all day. I look after the kid.
I never blame you for anything.

197
00:34:24,278 --> 00:34:27,077
And this is what I get.
Thank you very much.

198
00:34:27,078 --> 00:34:28,193
I'm sorry.

199
00:34:29,598 --> 00:34:30,826
I'm sorry.

200
00:34:46,718 --> 00:34:50,608
- Have you ever had an affair?
- No. Have you?

201
00:34:50,678 --> 00:34:51,997
No.

202
00:34:57,638 --> 00:35:00,088
Should I turn off the lights?

203
00:35:06,198 --> 00:35:08,848
I'll switch the night light on.

204
00:35:10,158 --> 00:35:11,477
As you wish.

205
00:36:04,278 --> 00:36:05,677
Can I kiss you?

206
00:36:06,438 --> 00:36:07,996
Why ask?

207
00:36:10,518 --> 00:36:13,032
My wife always says that too.

208
00:36:14,278 --> 00:36:17,468
What has it got to do with your wife?

209
00:36:18,998 --> 00:36:20,716
Sorry.

210
00:36:45,718 --> 00:36:48,073
Not like this. Softer.

211
00:36:49,158 --> 00:36:50,557
Sorry.

212
00:37:03,038 --> 00:37:04,038
What?

213
00:37:04,318 --> 00:37:06,309
Did I hurt you?

214
00:37:09,398 --> 00:37:10,956
Turn it off!

215
00:38:09,878 --> 00:38:10,993
I'm sorry.

216
00:38:12,038 --> 00:38:13,948
Are you feeling better?

217
00:38:14,878 --> 00:38:16,106
I don't know.

218
00:38:17,558 --> 00:38:18,911
I'm sorry.

219
00:38:56,278 --> 00:38:57,757
Smoke?

220
00:38:58,318 --> 00:38:59,797
No.

221
00:39:01,998 --> 00:39:03,511
Teach me how.

222
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:17,792
Just inale it. It's easy.

223
00:39:25,198 --> 00:39:28,634
Not too much,
or you'll get sick.

224
00:39:29,758 --> 00:39:31,589
I can't...

225
00:42:02,438 --> 00:42:07,228
Two bodies, heads pointing east
and feet south-west.

226
00:42:08,518 --> 00:42:10,588
Both naked.

227
00:42:11,318 --> 00:42:13,991
Cause of death: Fall.

228
00:42:15,558 --> 00:42:18,238
Suspecting multiple bone breakage.

229
00:42:21,918 --> 00:42:26,389
The man: Caucasian, no
distinguishing marks.

230
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:29,597
Mars body on top of the womars.

231
00:42:35,398 --> 00:42:39,107
Two idiots were making love
on the balcony.

232
00:42:45,878 --> 00:42:49,029
Two idiots
less in the world, huh?

233
00:42:51,558 --> 00:42:53,469
Put it away.

234
00:43:10,078 --> 00:43:13,757
Take a look and tell us
if you know these people.

235
00:43:13,758 --> 00:43:15,350
You first.

236
00:43:28,438 --> 00:43:30,030
This is my wife.

237
00:43:30,678 --> 00:43:32,157
Are you sure?

238
00:43:35,358 --> 00:43:37,030
Yes.

239
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:42,110
Your turn.

240
00:43:46,238 --> 00:43:47,876
Yes, it's him.

241
00:43:48,278 --> 00:43:50,277
You barely looked at him.

242
00:43:50,278 --> 00:43:55,077
We cannot include such an answer
in our report. Take a better look.

243
00:43:55,078 --> 00:43:57,990
- Can I do it later?
- Later?

244
00:43:58,398 --> 00:44:01,478
His body tissues
will start changing.

245
00:44:17,358 --> 00:44:19,826
- It's him.
- Him?

246
00:44:21,118 --> 00:44:24,108
We can't record
the body as "him".

247
00:44:27,078 --> 00:44:28,431
My husband.

248
00:44:30,598 --> 00:44:32,907
You can go.

249
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:37,598
But we'll meet again soon.

250
00:44:39,718 --> 00:44:40,912
Why?

251
00:44:41,678 --> 00:44:44,808
You'll need a burial
permit from me.

252
00:45:40,638 --> 00:45:43,027
Is whiskey OK?

253
00:45:43,678 --> 00:45:45,350
Why not?

254
00:46:17,518 --> 00:46:18,712
Thanks.

255
00:46:25,398 --> 00:46:27,468
- Want more?
- Yes.

256
00:46:29,998 --> 00:46:31,768
Why are you laughing?

257
00:46:33,438 --> 00:46:34,791
Just because.

258
00:46:36,078 --> 00:46:38,397
By the way, what do you do?

259
00:46:38,398 --> 00:46:39,558
Doesn't matter.

260
00:46:40,358 --> 00:46:41,837
Are you cold?

261
00:46:42,198 --> 00:46:43,995
I'm OK.

262
00:46:58,198 --> 00:47:00,075
Let's have more.

263
00:47:05,518 --> 00:47:06,917
A thunderstorm.

264
00:47:09,278 --> 00:47:10,757
Great.

265
00:47:12,398 --> 00:47:14,298
We need to find cover.

266
00:47:16,038 --> 00:47:18,108
Are you scared?

267
00:47:20,198 --> 00:47:21,888
I'm scared for you.

268
00:47:22,478 --> 00:47:24,833
We're not that close.

269
00:47:27,998 --> 00:47:31,513
I have to go.
I've got a son waiting.

270
00:47:44,318 --> 00:47:46,832
- Go.
- Let's go.

271
00:47:47,318 --> 00:47:49,558
- Don't yell!
- Let's go!

272
00:47:52,678 --> 00:47:53,952
Go!

273
00:48:28,278 --> 00:48:30,189
Everyone's scared.

274
00:49:37,998 --> 00:49:39,677
Did you get caught in the rain?

275
00:49:39,678 --> 00:49:41,077
No. You?

276
00:49:41,758 --> 00:49:43,396
I did.

277
00:49:44,958 --> 00:49:46,676
The flowers?

278
00:49:47,358 --> 00:49:49,738
I threw them out. They died.

279
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:09,917
Not too much salt I hope?

280
00:50:09,918 --> 00:50:11,351
No...

281
00:50:12,158 --> 00:50:13,591
It's great.

282
00:50:14,918 --> 00:50:16,338
Did you cook it?

283
00:50:16,438 --> 00:50:17,712
Yes.

284
00:50:20,158 --> 00:50:22,198
I never told you before,

285
00:50:22,958 --> 00:50:24,676
but I like to cook.

286
00:50:26,518 --> 00:50:29,178
Of course, mom does it better...

287
00:50:41,158 --> 00:50:42,227
Are you OK?

288
00:50:47,918 --> 00:50:51,998
- I don't know how to tell you.
- Tell me what?

289
00:50:53,158 --> 00:50:55,035
It's mom.

290
00:50:56,158 --> 00:50:57,798
Try to understand...

291
00:51:02,318 --> 00:51:03,938
How do I say it...

292
00:51:11,678 --> 00:51:13,778
She's no longer with us.

293
00:51:17,238 --> 00:51:18,830
She died.

294
00:51:19,758 --> 00:51:21,350
In an accident.

295
00:51:22,398 --> 00:51:24,848
She fell from a great height.

296
00:51:25,078 --> 00:51:26,488
I don't get it.

297
00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:31,311
She died.

298
00:51:32,798 --> 00:51:34,072
She's gone.

299
00:51:35,958 --> 00:51:37,152
Where is she?

300
00:51:39,438 --> 00:51:40,757
She's gone.

301
00:51:41,598 --> 00:51:42,598
Why?

302
00:51:44,918 --> 00:51:46,067
No.

303
00:51:46,998 --> 00:51:50,911
There was a balcony.

304
00:51:51,598 --> 00:51:53,873
A piece of it went loose.

305
00:51:54,438 --> 00:51:58,750
She leaned against
the railing and fell.

306
00:52:00,278 --> 00:52:02,587
A balcony? Where?

307
00:52:04,958 --> 00:52:06,357
At a hotel.

308
00:52:07,918 --> 00:52:10,028
What was she doing there?

309
00:52:13,598 --> 00:52:16,749
- Where is she now?
- In the morgue.

310
00:57:01,598 --> 00:57:03,350
You're here?

311
00:57:03,998 --> 00:57:05,795
Come in!

312
00:57:06,478 --> 00:57:07,797
Both of you.

313
00:57:16,398 --> 00:57:18,918
We came for the burial permit.

314
00:57:19,038 --> 00:57:21,478
You think I'll give you one?

315
00:57:22,038 --> 00:57:23,391
Why not?

316
00:57:25,398 --> 00:57:27,038
There's something...

317
00:57:28,958 --> 00:57:30,437
I don't get.

318
00:57:34,358 --> 00:57:36,110
How could...

319
00:57:37,798 --> 00:57:39,993
they fall like this?

320
00:57:40,638 --> 00:57:42,071
By accident.

321
00:57:42,598 --> 00:57:44,858
- By accident?
- Well, yes.

322
00:57:45,158 --> 00:57:46,788
It was an accident.

323
00:57:56,478 --> 00:57:59,268
What were you doing at the hotel?

324
00:58:02,878 --> 00:58:05,877
Sorry, we should have told you at once.

325
00:58:05,878 --> 00:58:07,357
We're lovers.

326
00:58:10,238 --> 00:58:11,637
You, too?

327
00:58:13,118 --> 00:58:14,688
That's interesting.

328
00:58:15,518 --> 00:58:17,958
Why didn't you tell me then?

329
00:58:19,518 --> 00:58:21,898
We thought it didn't matter.

330
00:58:24,398 --> 00:58:26,389
That you are lovers?

331
00:58:26,918 --> 00:58:28,317
Yes.

332
00:58:29,038 --> 00:58:32,038
And that you
were there that night?

333
00:58:32,678 --> 00:58:34,308
It's a coincidence.

334
00:58:46,438 --> 00:58:47,791
You know.

335
00:58:48,838 --> 00:58:51,968
I'm not giving you
the burial permit

336
00:58:53,838 --> 00:58:56,438
until the investigation is over.

337
00:58:57,438 --> 00:59:00,669
Are they going
to stay in the morgue?

338
00:59:01,078 --> 00:59:07,078
They're not the only ones to stay in there.
You think they're somewhat special?

339
00:59:13,518 --> 00:59:16,028
Why did you say we're lovers?

340
00:59:16,278 --> 00:59:18,458
Would the truth be better?

341
00:59:19,878 --> 00:59:21,391
I think it would.

342
00:59:22,398 --> 00:59:24,918
You could have told her, then.

343
00:59:32,678 --> 00:59:34,589
Is your wife beautiful?

344
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:37,268
Ask your husband.

345
00:59:52,718 --> 00:59:56,631
Sorry, it's the stress.

346
01:00:01,078 --> 01:00:03,997
Are you going to give
him a church funeral?

347
01:00:03,998 --> 01:00:06,378
Do you think it's necessary?

348
01:00:07,118 --> 01:00:08,312
I guess.

349
01:00:11,078 --> 01:00:12,511
A church funeral?

350
01:00:13,918 --> 01:00:19,918
- Why would you need a church funeral?
- Laugh one more time, and I'll hit you.

351
01:00:56,118 --> 01:00:57,187
Thank you.

352
01:00:58,078 --> 01:00:59,670
I feel better now.

353
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:08,598
I feel better now.

354
01:01:15,398 --> 01:01:19,218
I decided I will do without
a church funeral.

355
01:01:21,438 --> 01:01:24,396
I think it won't help them.

356
01:02:15,438 --> 01:02:17,818
Why didn't you come earlier?

357
01:02:18,958 --> 01:02:20,789
I killed them.

358
01:02:21,478 --> 01:02:22,957
Alone?

359
01:02:24,438 --> 01:02:27,271
Yes. She's innocent.

360
01:02:28,918 --> 01:02:30,829
It was me.

361
01:02:32,398 --> 01:02:35,538
I detached the railing
from the wall.

362
01:02:37,278 --> 01:02:39,588
It was loose to start with.

363
01:02:43,438 --> 01:02:45,030
She's innocent.

364
01:02:59,878 --> 01:03:01,998
Write down your statement.

365
01:06:36,798 --> 01:06:38,428
Here's your permit.

366
01:06:40,638 --> 01:06:41,787
Go.

367
01:06:44,558 --> 01:06:46,878
This is for your girlfriend.

368
01:06:54,198 --> 01:06:55,837
She's not my girlfriend.

369
01:06:55,838 --> 01:06:57,032
Doesn't matter.

370
01:07:11,198 --> 01:07:12,677
Can I go?

371
01:07:16,118 --> 01:07:18,188
Kiss me.

372
01:07:19,638 --> 01:07:21,198
I beg your pardon?

373
01:07:21,758 --> 01:07:23,396
Kiss me.

374
01:07:36,478 --> 01:07:37,558
On the lips.

375
01:07:53,358 --> 01:07:55,076
Go.

376
01:08:11,078 --> 01:08:14,229
You were so outgoing.

377
01:08:14,358 --> 01:08:17,350
Always nice and cheerful,

378
01:08:17,958 --> 01:08:20,267
generous and giving.

379
01:08:21,598 --> 01:08:25,432
Thank you for the joy
you've given us.

380
01:08:29,718 --> 01:08:32,718
You left us
so young and beautiful,

381
01:08:32,758 --> 01:08:36,298
and that's how we'll
always remember you.

382
01:08:38,598 --> 01:08:39,951
Good-bye.

383
01:08:41,358 --> 01:08:43,948
You have always been an example

384
01:08:44,038 --> 01:08:47,553
of discipline and high moral values.

385
01:08:48,918 --> 01:08:52,068
You always had our
sincere admiration.

386
01:08:52,918 --> 01:08:55,028
We grieve for you deeply,

387
01:08:55,878 --> 01:08:58,870
and will always remember you.

388
01:09:04,438 --> 01:09:06,268
Time to say good-bye.

389
01:11:41,278 --> 01:11:42,313
Here?

390
01:12:58,198 --> 01:12:59,688
What do you want?

391
01:13:06,558 --> 01:13:08,048
I wanted to talk.

392
01:13:09,078 --> 01:13:10,078
About what?

393
01:13:16,398 --> 01:13:18,908
I can't stop thinking of you.

394
01:13:22,558 --> 01:13:23,786
Are you crazy?

395
01:13:30,878 --> 01:13:33,248
I want to go on seeing you.

396
01:13:35,078 --> 01:13:37,397
Please don't call me anymore.

397
01:13:37,398 --> 01:13:40,998
I don't ever want
to hear from you again.

398
01:14:00,038 --> 01:14:01,598
Stay away from me.

399
01:16:50,398 --> 01:16:52,368
I thought you got lost.

400
01:16:52,598 --> 01:16:58,598
The forest here is too thin. I had to
walk quite far away from the road.

401
01:18:09,598 --> 01:18:11,156
Give me the map.

402
01:18:44,478 --> 01:18:46,912
Or you could just follow us.

403
01:18:47,278 --> 01:18:48,778
All right, thanks.

404
01:19:06,198 --> 01:19:08,378
Why are we following them?

405
01:19:08,518 --> 01:19:11,588
They're going in
the same direction.

406
01:19:11,918 --> 01:19:13,968
Is this really necessary?

407
01:19:14,398 --> 01:19:17,357
It's late. We need
to stop for the night.

408
01:19:17,358 --> 01:19:19,198
I am falling asleep...

409
01:20:09,198 --> 01:20:12,958
We could swim in the pool
tomorrow morning...

410
01:20:13,318 --> 01:20:14,917
They have a pool here?

411
01:20:14,918 --> 01:20:16,033
Yeah.

412
01:20:22,638 --> 01:20:24,958
I thought you were sleepy...

413
01:21:16,998 --> 01:21:19,148
Ionized water.

414
01:21:21,838 --> 01:21:24,228
It has a rejuvenating effect.

415
01:21:25,358 --> 01:21:28,778
Please put out the lights
before leaving.

416
01:23:12,918 --> 01:23:14,749
The water's nice.

417
01:23:15,358 --> 01:23:18,350
Ionized. They say it's rejuvenating.

418
01:23:22,478 --> 01:23:24,277
Was that your husband?

419
01:23:24,278 --> 01:23:25,313
Yes.

420
01:23:27,038 --> 01:23:28,868
How long has it been?

421
01:23:29,158 --> 01:23:30,477
No idea.

422
01:23:32,558 --> 01:23:33,957
You look great.

423
01:23:34,918 --> 01:23:37,298
You mean I'm well preserved?

424
01:23:39,398 --> 01:23:41,848
No, I mean you look terrific.

425
01:23:43,358 --> 01:23:45,110
You too.

426
01:23:47,398 --> 01:23:48,911
You never moved?

427
01:23:49,798 --> 01:23:50,913
No.

428
01:23:51,758 --> 01:23:54,348
- How's life?
- Good. For you?

429
01:23:55,758 --> 01:23:57,077
Not bad.

430
01:23:59,918 --> 01:24:01,678
How old is your boy?

431
01:24:02,318 --> 01:24:04,786
Five. Do you have kids?

432
01:24:05,598 --> 01:24:07,498
I can't have children.

433
01:24:14,398 --> 01:24:15,831
Sorry.

434
01:24:17,158 --> 01:24:20,707
Really, you do look amazing.

435
01:24:21,438 --> 01:24:22,587
Thank you.

436
01:24:23,758 --> 01:24:26,328
I think
I'm going to go now.

437
01:25:38,558 --> 01:25:41,357
- Did you sleep well?
- Very well, thanks.

438
01:25:41,358 --> 01:25:42,448
Good morning!

439
01:25:42,678 --> 01:25:44,357
Did you enjoy the pool?

440
01:25:44,358 --> 01:25:45,378
Yes, thanks.

441
01:25:45,758 --> 01:25:47,938
Did you go swimming? When?

442
01:25:48,518 --> 01:25:49,917
This morning. I couldn't sleep.

443
01:25:49,918 --> 01:25:52,037
It's small, and not too clean.

444
01:25:52,038 --> 01:25:54,397
- Did you sleep well?
- Yes, and you?

445
01:25:54,398 --> 01:25:55,467
Very well.

446
01:25:56,318 --> 01:25:58,088
When are you leaving?

447
01:25:58,198 --> 01:25:59,198
Around ten.

448
01:25:59,798 --> 01:26:01,390
Same time as us.

449
01:26:01,838 --> 01:26:04,478
I think we won't get lost now.

450
01:26:14,118 --> 01:26:15,187
Thank you.

451
01:26:20,198 --> 01:26:22,098
Look how well you eat.

452
01:26:23,918 --> 01:26:25,146
Good boy.

453
01:26:37,078 --> 01:26:38,998
- Coffee?
- No, thanks.

454
01:26:41,118 --> 01:26:42,471
Coffee, please.

455
01:26:44,998 --> 01:26:46,590
Two more, please.

456
01:27:05,398 --> 01:27:07,158
It's stuffy in here.

457
01:27:07,838 --> 01:27:09,317
Yes.

458
01:28:28,278 --> 01:28:30,317
Can you describe the pain?

459
01:28:30,318 --> 01:28:34,675
- No.
- You told me you had stabbing pain.

460
01:28:35,518 --> 01:28:37,031
It's different.

461
01:28:39,518 --> 01:28:41,597
Does it hurt more at
any specific time of day?

462
01:28:41,598 --> 01:28:43,677
In the morning, or in the evening?

463
01:28:43,678 --> 01:28:47,077
It used to hurt more after PE at school.
Now, it hurts all the time.

464
01:28:47,078 --> 01:28:52,808
What's that knife for? Tell the
doctor why you always carry a knife.

465
01:28:56,478 --> 01:28:58,237
Why do you carry it?

466
01:28:58,238 --> 01:28:59,738
To protect myself.

467
01:29:03,038 --> 01:29:07,408
All right, get undressed.
I'll listen to your heart.

468
01:29:08,678 --> 01:29:10,298
Am I going to die?

469
01:29:10,958 --> 01:29:11,958
No.

470
01:29:13,278 --> 01:29:17,308
Your condition is often
linked to fear of death.

471
01:29:18,278 --> 01:29:22,158
- I don't want to die.
- Oh, stop it already!

472
01:29:22,238 --> 01:29:26,997
I'm sick of hearing it. All she
ever talks about is death!

473
01:29:26,998 --> 01:29:30,277
- I'm not interested in talking about
anything else! - Really?

474
01:29:30,278 --> 01:29:35,338
Keep still. Sit on the couch.
Could you wait outside, please?

475
01:29:38,758 --> 01:29:41,478
Do you want to talk about death?

476
01:29:43,718 --> 01:29:44,718
Go ahead.

477
01:29:46,438 --> 01:29:48,747
It's intimidating.

478
01:29:50,598 --> 01:29:52,077
What else?

479
01:29:56,958 --> 01:29:58,676
Look,

480
01:30:04,438 --> 01:30:07,430
death is beautiful.

481
01:30:08,358 --> 01:30:12,798
The most beautiful thing that
can ever happen to you.

482
01:30:12,998 --> 01:30:14,147
Really?

483
01:30:14,998 --> 01:30:16,113
Yes.

484
01:30:24,198 --> 01:30:26,238
You have a strong heart.

485
01:30:27,038 --> 01:30:29,688
You will live a very long life.

486
01:30:30,958 --> 01:30:32,994
Can I do sports?

487
01:30:33,558 --> 01:30:36,356
Yes. But don't strain yourself.

488
01:30:59,118 --> 01:31:00,517
Next!

489
01:31:24,478 --> 01:31:25,547
Hello.

490
01:31:28,278 --> 01:31:29,597
Hello.

491
01:31:34,118 --> 01:31:35,818
I thought you moved.

492
01:31:37,278 --> 01:31:39,792
I did. I'm here for a visit.

493
01:31:42,758 --> 01:31:44,271
Any complaints?

494
01:31:45,638 --> 01:31:48,835
Well... I just don't
feel very good.

495
01:31:55,158 --> 01:31:59,248
Take off your clothes.
I'll listen to your heart.

496
01:32:03,798 --> 01:32:05,277
All of them?

497
01:32:09,998 --> 01:32:11,558
From the waist up.

498
01:32:25,038 --> 01:32:26,391
Too cold?

499
01:32:30,038 --> 01:32:32,208
I can't live without you.

500
01:32:32,358 --> 01:32:33,358
I can't.

501
01:33:15,038 --> 01:33:16,153
OK.

502
01:33:16,638 --> 01:33:21,587
Now, get dressed
and lay on the couch.

503
01:33:30,478 --> 01:33:34,308
Your heartbeat is a little
faster than normal.

504
01:33:35,478 --> 01:33:37,728
No reason to worry, though.

505
01:33:45,758 --> 01:33:48,338
I'm staying at the same place.

506
01:36:01,038 --> 01:36:02,790
Where have you been?

507
01:36:03,278 --> 01:36:05,378
I've sent you a message.

508
01:36:07,318 --> 01:36:10,477
But you didn't say you'd
be home at 2 a.m.

509
01:36:10,478 --> 01:36:13,258
I didn't realize it was so late.

510
01:36:21,078 --> 01:36:24,768
I was worried something had
happened to you.

511
01:36:25,558 --> 01:36:27,389
Like what?

512
01:36:28,078 --> 01:36:32,148
Come on, go to bed.
I'll be there in a minute.

513
01:36:40,398 --> 01:36:41,990
I think she knows.

514
01:36:43,718 --> 01:36:45,310
So what?

515
01:36:46,438 --> 01:36:47,951
She's suffering.

516
01:36:49,198 --> 01:36:51,298
She will get used to it.

517
01:36:51,598 --> 01:36:53,498
It's always like that.

518
01:36:57,358 --> 01:37:00,668
I need to stop, of course...

519
01:37:02,478 --> 01:37:07,308
But I can't. I've been thinking
about you all this time.

520
01:37:16,398 --> 01:37:19,948
Do you think of your
first wife sometimes?

521
01:37:20,718 --> 01:37:22,748
Let's not talk of them.

522
01:37:23,158 --> 01:37:25,388
They're dead.

523
01:37:27,318 --> 01:37:28,353
Yes.

524
01:37:31,238 --> 01:37:32,591
Yes.

525
01:37:37,118 --> 01:37:38,710
Yes.

526
01:37:44,518 --> 01:37:46,156
Yes.

527
01:37:48,798 --> 01:37:50,356
Yes.

528
01:37:59,038 --> 01:38:01,357
Do they always come together?

529
01:38:01,358 --> 01:38:02,858
Sometimes they do.

530
01:38:07,478 --> 01:38:08,908
Which room again?

531
01:38:09,758 --> 01:38:11,316
769.

532
01:38:37,438 --> 01:38:41,431
Excuse me.
I locked my card inside the room.

533
01:38:46,318 --> 01:38:48,978
- There you go.
- Thanks a lot.

534
01:40:12,998 --> 01:40:14,670
I'm so sweaty.

535
01:40:21,838 --> 01:40:24,157
Do you want to go
swimming once again?

536
01:40:24,158 --> 01:40:25,557
No.

537
01:40:26,758 --> 01:40:28,858
I'm going to the shower.

538
01:40:59,758 --> 01:41:01,032
I'll go.

539
01:41:02,038 --> 01:41:04,138
I can't stay any longer.

540
01:42:41,558 --> 01:42:43,258
Where have you been?

541
01:42:44,918 --> 01:42:48,458
Why are you smoking?
I was at the office.

542
01:42:50,038 --> 01:42:51,437
I was worried.

543
01:42:51,998 --> 01:42:54,038
What could happen to me?

544
01:42:57,198 --> 01:42:58,748
I'll be a minute.

545
01:44:19,998 --> 01:44:22,038
Why aren't you sleeping?

546
01:44:22,358 --> 01:44:23,708
I can't. Sorry.

547
01:44:27,518 --> 01:44:29,008
It's cold here...

548
01:44:30,518 --> 01:44:33,237
Do you want me to get
you something?

549
01:44:33,238 --> 01:44:36,196
No, thank you. Go to bed.

550
01:44:37,478 --> 01:44:38,768
What about you?

551
01:44:39,358 --> 01:44:41,110
I'll join you soon.

552
01:44:58,038 --> 01:45:01,038
You promised me
you'd stop smoking.

553
01:45:01,838 --> 01:45:03,317
I will.

554
01:45:10,718 --> 01:45:12,068
Do you love me?

555
01:45:14,758 --> 01:45:16,316
Yes. Why?

556
01:45:16,678 --> 01:45:18,077
Just asking.

557
01:45:41,758 --> 01:45:43,077
I love you.

558
01:47:29,998 --> 01:47:30,998
Hello!

559
01:47:31,358 --> 01:47:36,237
Excuse me, has the guest
from room 769 checked out already?

560
01:47:36,238 --> 01:47:38,917
Sorry, we can't disclose
this kind of information.

561
01:47:38,918 --> 01:47:40,678
How can we help you?

562
01:47:41,358 --> 01:47:45,477
He's a friend of mine. He's
not answering his phone.

563
01:47:45,478 --> 01:47:49,578
I'm worried something
might have happened to him.

564
01:48:00,678 --> 01:48:02,270
No answer.

565
01:48:07,238 --> 01:48:09,308
Thank you.

566
01:48:12,278 --> 01:48:14,473
Open it.

567
01:48:30,958 --> 01:48:32,232
Nobody here.

568
01:48:35,718 --> 01:48:37,310
Go check there...

569
01:49:49,158 --> 01:49:51,118
I need to talk to you.

570
01:49:51,958 --> 01:49:53,357
Go ahead.

571
01:49:55,518 --> 01:49:57,634
I'd like to ask

572
01:49:59,118 --> 01:50:00,836
if he was murdered.

573
01:50:01,078 --> 01:50:02,306
Yeah.

574
01:50:04,278 --> 01:50:05,711
Someone came in,

575
01:50:06,638 --> 01:50:09,557
forced him
to have a heart attack,

576
01:50:09,558 --> 01:50:12,437
then locked the door
from the inside...

577
01:50:12,438 --> 01:50:13,728
A heart attack?

578
01:50:14,118 --> 01:50:17,110
Yes. A common heart attack.

579
01:50:17,798 --> 01:50:21,757
What they used to call
a "burst heart".

580
01:50:22,358 --> 01:50:23,916
What do you mean?

581
01:50:24,878 --> 01:50:26,708
You don't believe it?

582
01:50:27,758 --> 01:50:28,848
I understand.

583
01:50:30,398 --> 01:50:33,058
People don't like boring deaths.

584
01:50:34,198 --> 01:50:36,871
Boring deaths... Keep it down!

585
01:50:38,158 --> 01:50:41,389
Boring lives...

586
01:50:42,678 --> 01:50:45,272
You'd prefer a murder.

587
01:50:46,038 --> 01:50:47,608
People are strange.

588
01:51:14,958 --> 01:51:17,958
I tried to go in the room, but
there was the sign "Don't disturb".

589
01:51:17,959 --> 01:51:20,958
I couldn't do anything.
