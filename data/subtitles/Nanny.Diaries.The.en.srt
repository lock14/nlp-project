1
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:13,119
Name... Annie Braddock.

2
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:16,160
Age... 21.

3
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,320
Area of interest...

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:21,739
anthropology.

5
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:23,699
Describe your
work experience

6
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,570
as it relates
to your intended field.

7
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:28,660
My God.

8
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:31,320
Where do I begin?

9
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,369
Attention. The Museum of Natural History

10
00:00:34,409 --> 00:00:37,070
will be closing in
15 minutes.

11
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,280
Please exit the hall

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,869
by using
the western staircase.

13
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:58,909
Child-rearing around the world

14
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:02,240
boasts a wide variety of
customs and mores.

15
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:10,450
But perhaps the most bizarre
social patterns

16
00:01:10,489 --> 00:01:13,950
can be found within the small island
community of Manhattan.

17
00:01:13,989 --> 00:01:16,200
Asshole!

18
00:01:16,239 --> 00:01:19,200
The inhabitants of the region
known as the Upper East Side

19
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:22,200
have the most prosperous,
yet idiosyncratic

20
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,659
social systems
on the planet.

21
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:26,489
After successfully mating

22
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,319
and producing offspring,

23
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:30,780
the men are often distant
and uninvolved,

24
00:01:30,819 --> 00:01:32,870
leaving their women
to hunt, gather

25
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:34,990
and provide for
their families.

26
00:01:38,069 --> 00:01:41,370
Yet the resourceful mothers
of the Upper East Side

27
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:43,370
have plenty of time
to participate

28
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:46,700
in a variety of sex-role-
specific activities.

29
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:50,620
These include
body mutilation,

30
00:01:50,659 --> 00:01:53,950
sacred meditation...

31
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:56,030
...even fasting rituals.

32
00:01:59,409 --> 00:02:02,280
Which brings us to our focus
on child-rearing:

33
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,069
Who actually does it?

34
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:06,700
Well, in Africa,
they have a saying...

35
00:02:06,739 --> 00:02:09,370
"It takes a village
to raise a child."

36
00:02:09,409 --> 00:02:11,699
But for the tribe of
the Upper East Side,

37
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:14,030
it takes just
one person...

38
00:02:14,069 --> 00:02:15,949
the nanny.

39
00:02:21,699 --> 00:02:23,740
Okay, so what's
depicted here

40
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:25,909
is not a typical
tribal ritual,

41
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:29,370
but rather the unraveling
of one such nanny.

42
00:02:29,409 --> 00:02:31,990
Actually, this nanny is me.

43
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:34,780
And why I'm telling off
a teddy bear is the subject

44
00:02:34,819 --> 00:02:36,659
of this field diary.

45
00:02:36,699 --> 00:02:40,409
If by chance my report stereotypes
or geographically profiles,

46
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:42,240
forgive me.

47
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,569
I'm not exactly
an objective observer.

48
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,530
Master in economics,
minor in communications.

49
00:02:52,569 --> 00:02:55,569
- Yeah!
- Elaine Bassen,

50
00:02:55,569 --> 00:02:58,569
honors in urban planning,
minor in sociology.

51
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,409
Annie Braddock,

52
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:04,319
high honors in business,
minor in anthropology.

53
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:07,120
So here I am a few months before
the teddy bear incident...

54
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:08,280
Whoo-whoo!

55
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:09,819
...a native New Jersey girl

56
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:12,319
participating in a dreaded
rite-of-passage ceremony.

57
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:14,280
- Doh!
Oh my God!

58
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,780
Spazz!

59
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:17,240
And here's the woman who reared me

60
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,990
pretty much all
by herself.

61
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:20,870
She's a nurse.

62
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,030
Note the shoes.

63
00:03:23,069 --> 00:03:26,530
What is it?

64
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:29,280
You'll see.

65
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:32,370
Oh, wow.

66
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:34,569
- Thank you.
- I know it's not much,

67
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,069
but I wanted to buy you
your first business suit.

68
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,659
- Thanks. Thank you.
- You can look back on this

69
00:03:39,699 --> 00:03:42,030
- when you're a famous CFO.
- Oh, Mom.

70
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:44,659
Gosh, come on. It's one meeting
at Goldman Sachs.

71
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:48,569
It's highly competitive.
I'm probably never gonna get the job.

72
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:50,620
All right, stop
with the negativity.

73
00:03:50,659 --> 00:03:53,199
Your father was always negative
and look where it got him.

74
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:56,699
- Double-wide trailer in Scranton.
...in Scranton.

75
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,740
Honey, I'm not kidding.

76
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:01,740
I would give the world to be sitting
where you're sitting right now.

77
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:04,370
You are so much
smarter than I was.

78
00:04:04,409 --> 00:04:06,699
No man is gonna
squash your dreams.

79
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:10,490
No one's gonna tell you
how to live your life.

80
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,409
Maybe I'm... maybe I'm not
CFO material, you know?

81
00:04:14,409 --> 00:04:17,870
No, what if I'm better
suited at something...

82
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,410
- something else?
- Like what?

83
00:04:19,449 --> 00:04:21,990
Anthropology? Honey how are you
gonna make a living at that?

84
00:04:22,069 --> 00:04:25,410
Look, if you really want to
run around in grass skirts,

85
00:04:25,449 --> 00:04:29,160
then make enough money to
spend Christmas at Club Med.

86
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,240
Annie, it's 7:15.

87
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,159
Get moving or
you're gonna be late.

88
00:04:42,569 --> 00:04:44,199
New Jersey PATH train to Manhattan

89
00:04:44,279 --> 00:04:45,949
arriving on track two.

90
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:47,199
Oh.

91
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,870
New Jersey PATH train
to Manhattan

92
00:04:48,909 --> 00:04:50,529
arriving on track two.

93
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:58,199
Oh, goodness.

94
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,199
I have to admire
this corporate drag. Wow.

95
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,199
Well, at least I'm not wearing last
night's outfit at 8:00 a.m., party girl.

96
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:08,410
Let's just say that you
missed a fabulous throw-down

97
00:05:08,449 --> 00:05:10,370
and Tom Waylan was there.

98
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:11,990
- So?
- He asked about you.

99
00:05:12,069 --> 00:05:13,410
Twice.

100
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:15,620
All right, well,
I gotta go.

101
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,660
- Real life awaits.
- God.

102
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:19,699
You know, I bet none of
those cultures you study

103
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,529
practice such
rigorous celibacy.

104
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:24,279
- You ever hear of the Shakers?
- Yes, and they're extinct.

105
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,069
Excuse me, sir? Sir.

106
00:05:33,069 --> 00:05:34,909
- Yeah?
- I got off at the wrong stop.

107
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:37,319
Can you tell me where
Chambers Street is, please?

108
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:39,240
You see the building
with the red umbrella?

109
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,449
- Yes.
- It's about five blocks below that.

110
00:05:41,490 --> 00:05:43,240
Oh shit.

111
00:05:44,909 --> 00:05:47,779
Our financial analyst training program

112
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:49,449
is so competitive.

113
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,779
We have over 8,000 applicants
for 10 positions.

114
00:05:52,819 --> 00:05:54,870
So, why don't you
tell me,

115
00:05:54,909 --> 00:05:58,779
in your own words,
who exactly is Annie Braddock?

116
00:05:58,819 --> 00:06:00,779
Wow, that's...

117
00:06:00,819 --> 00:06:03,319
that's certainly
an easy enough question.

118
00:06:03,370 --> 00:06:05,199
Mm-hm.

119
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:07,569
Annie Braddock is

120
00:06:07,569 --> 00:06:10,240
a kind...

121
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,490
well...

122
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,569
I am...

123
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:20,240
Go on.

124
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:23,240
Well, you see...

125
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:25,029
Mm-hm.

126
00:06:25,069 --> 00:06:27,160
I have absolutely
no idea.

127
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,370
Excuse me.

128
00:06:30,949 --> 00:06:32,990
Who is Annie Braddock?

129
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:35,029
It wasn't exactly
a trick question.

130
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:38,569
Yet somehow I couldn't
formulate a response.

131
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,870
Of course I knew
all the basic facts...

132
00:06:40,909 --> 00:06:44,199
the date of birth, home town,
socioeconomic makeup.

133
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:47,449
But I didn't really know
who I was, where I fit in,

134
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,569
who I was gonna be.

135
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:52,779
I was suddenly terrified
I'd never find the answer.

136
00:06:52,819 --> 00:06:55,569
I need five rolls of fabric
overnighted from London.

137
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,159
I don't care
how much it costs.

138
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,529
# Ooh #

139
00:06:59,529 --> 00:07:01,910
# You're a native
New Yorker... #

140
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:03,620
How about her?

141
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,370
This woman... could she
be Annie Braddock?

142
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,620
# You should know by now #

143
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,779
# You're a native
New Yorker... #

144
00:07:13,910 --> 00:07:16,410
Hmm.

145
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:20,529
Or perhaps this
is Annie Braddock?

146
00:07:22,910 --> 00:07:27,029
# You grew up
riding the subways #

147
00:07:27,069 --> 00:07:29,449
# Running with people #

148
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,240
# Up in Harlem,
down on Broadway #

149
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:35,740
# There you are
lost in the shadows #

150
00:07:35,779 --> 00:07:38,449
# Searching for someone #

151
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:41,529
# You're the heart and soul
of New York City... #

152
00:07:44,029 --> 00:07:46,029
On that spring afternoon,

153
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:49,990
it seemed my future
was finally set.

154
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:52,370
A Central Park bag lady
I would be.

155
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:56,029
At least I'd finally get
to live in Manhattan.

156
00:07:56,069 --> 00:07:58,819
But before I officially
surrendered to fate,

157
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:02,120
something... or rather,
someone...

158
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,870
intervened.

159
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,620
Mmm.

160
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,370
- Whoa!
- Ahh ahh!

161
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:20,449
Hello there.

162
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,870
Hi.
Are you okay?

163
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:24,069
Get off of me,
you pervert.

164
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:31,490
Do you belong to anyone,
little man?

165
00:08:31,529 --> 00:08:34,029
Grayer!
- I belong to you.

166
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:36,659
Grayer!

167
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,740
Oh God.
Thank you so much.

168
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:42,570
You just averted
a minor disaster.

169
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,570
The woman featured here...

170
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,529
the one wearing
the Dior snakeskin jacket

171
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:47,870
and Louis Vuitton
shoes...

172
00:08:47,909 --> 00:08:50,240
is unfortunately not
Annie Braddock.

173
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,529
# New York City girl... #

174
00:08:54,409 --> 00:08:57,070
She is, in fact, a perfect
female specimen

175
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,990
from the
Upper East Side clan.

176
00:08:59,029 --> 00:09:00,870
For the purpose of
this case study,

177
00:09:00,909 --> 00:09:03,740
we'll just call her
Mrs. X.

178
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:06,120
Hi, I'm Mrs. X.

179
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:08,700
Let me apologize for
my feral son.

180
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:10,740
Oh, no need to
apologize.

181
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:12,370
Please, I love kids.
I'm Annie.

182
00:09:12,409 --> 00:09:14,490
You're a nanny?
Oh!

183
00:09:14,529 --> 00:09:15,990
- No, I'm not.
- No wonder.

184
00:09:16,029 --> 00:09:18,120
- You're so good with children.
- Oh, I'm not.

185
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,490
Actually, I just
lost my nanny Bertie,

186
00:09:20,529 --> 00:09:22,990
which is why I'm out in
this godforsaken park

187
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,620
- by myself.
- Okay.

188
00:09:24,659 --> 00:09:26,659
- She left us to go get married.
- All right.

189
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:29,659
Oh my God.
Are... are you employed?

190
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,450
- No, unfortunately, l...
- Fabulous!

191
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:35,450
Look, here...
here is my card.

192
00:09:35,490 --> 00:09:38,570
Please please please
call me later this week.

193
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:40,570
We'll schedule a lunch.
Anywhere you'd like to go.

194
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,490
- I'm sorry...
- The Mark, the Four Seasons.

195
00:09:42,529 --> 00:09:45,409
Unfortunately, I have to run, but I
really look forward to hearing from you.

196
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,279
I'm sorry... I really think
you misunderstood me.

197
00:09:47,320 --> 00:09:49,240
I have a very
good feeling about this.

198
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:50,909
- I...
- Call me.

199
00:09:58,409 --> 00:10:00,370
Pardon me, I couldn't
help but overhear.

200
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:02,200
I'm looking for
a new nanny too.

201
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,870
- Oh I...
- Can I give you my card as well?

202
00:10:03,909 --> 00:10:06,240
- Excuse me?
- I pay well above average.

203
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:09,279
- I have a card too, call me.
- I have a place in the Hamptons.

204
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:11,370
Donald Trump lives
in my building.

205
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:14,370
It seemed that fate now
offered me a wonderful alternative...

206
00:10:14,409 --> 00:10:17,490
an opportunity to completely
duck out of my life.

207
00:10:17,529 --> 00:10:20,029
So I decided for
one summer

208
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:22,279
to abandon Annie

209
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,950
and trade her in for
a brand-new persona...

210
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:26,740
Nanny.

211
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,909
Of course there was
one tiny problem.

212
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:36,870
Everything I knew about
nannying came from the movies.

213
00:10:38,529 --> 00:10:42,159
Even so, I fell
asleep confident

214
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:44,950
that I'd magically
find my way.

215
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:53,909
Annie?

216
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:55,870
Annie!

217
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,740
Annie?

218
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:24,070
Ahh-hoo-hoo!

219
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:28,450
Get your feet
on the ground, young lady.

220
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:52,159
Hmm.

221
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,279
The fact that I had
no child-care experience

222
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,740
mattered little to the matriarchs
of the Upper East Side.

223
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:06,320
Even though I
don't have a job,

224
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:09,490
I just don't seem to have
enough time for myself.

225
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,740
All they needed
to know was that I was white,

226
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:14,740
a college grad,
and terminally single.

227
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:17,070
As you can see,
my husband and I

228
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:18,529
are getting a divorce.

229
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,950
So you and the kids
must remain

230
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:23,909
on my side of
the apartment

231
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,700
at all times...

232
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,740
until the custody
battle is settled.

233
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,779
Oh...

234
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:34,700
In short, I was the Chanel
bag of nannies.

235
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,490
I heard through the grapevine

236
00:12:36,529 --> 00:12:38,070
you've been meeting
with a lot of people.

237
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:40,870
So I thought you might appreciate
a civilized lunch at Bergdorf's

238
00:12:40,909 --> 00:12:42,570
rather than being
interviewed at the apartment.

239
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:44,159
Thank you,
that's very considerate.

240
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:46,740
Not really.
I just love to eat out.

241
00:12:46,779 --> 00:12:48,740
I'll probably come up
with a million excuses

242
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:50,240
for us to go have lunch.

243
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,570
I mean, if you end up
with us, I mean.

244
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,620
Ready?

245
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:56,820
Do... do you know
what you're having?

246
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:58,740
I don't mean
to rush you,

247
00:12:58,779 --> 00:13:01,950
but I'm attending a 2:00 lecture

248
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,200
"Super Mom, Trying to Juggle It All."

249
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:07,659
I'll just have the burger.

250
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:10,700
Thanks.

251
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,279
I can't guarantee
that the meat here

252
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:16,200
is antibiotic-free.
But the chef here is from Brittany,

253
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,950
so I highly recommend the crepe
Bretagne. Deux, s'il vous plait.

254
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:22,370
- Okay.
- Excellent choice.

255
00:13:22,409 --> 00:13:23,950
Thanks.

256
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,740
You're from New Jersey.

257
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:30,909
Unfortunately.

258
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:34,490
Oh no, there are some very
lovely parts of that state.

259
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:37,200
Friends of ours have a horse
farm in Upper Saddle River.

260
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,659
- Really?
- Mm-hm.

261
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:41,029
l... I hear it's
really nice there.

262
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,820
I'll have to take you
riding there one day.

263
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:44,070
Okay.

264
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,950
Tell me more.

265
00:13:45,990 --> 00:13:49,029
I want to know
all about you.

266
00:13:49,029 --> 00:13:52,200
- Uh...
- I'm from Connecticut, actually.

267
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,570
I went to Smith.
And don't believe the rumors,

268
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,779
we weren't all
lesbians.

269
00:13:56,820 --> 00:13:58,279
After graduation,

270
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,120
I moved here and started
running the Gagosian.

271
00:14:02,159 --> 00:14:04,120
The art gallery.

272
00:14:04,159 --> 00:14:06,159
- Oh.
- It was a blast.

273
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,200
But you really... you can't
do that sort of thing

274
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,529
when you're raising a child.

275
00:14:09,570 --> 00:14:12,320
The parties,
the schmoozing, the travel...

276
00:14:12,370 --> 00:14:14,200
Oh, excuse me...

277
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,950
- Oh.
- Bitsy.

278
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,570
- It's you.
- Bitsy.

279
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:20,120
I've so been
meaning to call.

280
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:22,370
Is there anything
at all I can do?

281
00:14:22,409 --> 00:14:24,240
Not unless you
know a hit man.

282
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:26,700
That lawyer Jeanie Whitman
recommended was no help at all.

283
00:14:26,740 --> 00:14:28,320
I am so sorry.

284
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:31,620
Turns out all our assets
are actually in Tucker's company's name.

285
00:14:31,659 --> 00:14:33,620
All I'm getting
is a million flat.

286
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:35,950
That's appalling.

287
00:14:35,990 --> 00:14:40,490
If I'd known it would go this far,
I would have just turned a blind eye.

288
00:14:40,529 --> 00:14:43,779
Anyway, enjoy the rest
of your lunch before I ruin that too.

289
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:46,370
I'll call you later
this week, sweetheart.

290
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:53,320
Such a shame.

291
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:56,570
But she should have seen it
coming... everyone else did.

292
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:59,240
Anyway, where were we?
Ah yes.

293
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,820
After Gagosian,

294
00:15:01,870 --> 00:15:04,490
I met Mr. X.

295
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:09,320
You know, my grandmother
worked as a domestic

296
00:15:09,370 --> 00:15:11,029
so we wouldn't have to.

297
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:13,240
And here you are,
fresh out of college

298
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,700
voluntarily taking
a nanny gig.

299
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:18,450
I told you, this is not
a lifelong commitment.

300
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:21,200
Okay? It's just a way
for me to get my head together.

301
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,990
Besides,
the money is great.

302
00:15:23,029 --> 00:15:25,159
I finally get to
move to the city.

303
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,870
I'm moving to the city
to go to grad school,

304
00:15:27,909 --> 00:15:29,529
not to be somebody's
servant.

305
00:15:29,570 --> 00:15:32,070
Plus you know you're wrong,
or you wouldn't be lying to your mother.

306
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:34,620
This is all just
happening too fast.

307
00:15:34,659 --> 00:15:37,990
I don't understand why you can't
just live at the house for a while,

308
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:39,320
just to get on your feet.

309
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:41,320
Mom, I lived at home through
four years of college.

310
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:42,700
Don't you think
that's long enough?

311
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,490
Well, how could you find
a decent apartment so fast?

312
00:15:44,529 --> 00:15:47,659
The bank has, you know,
an excellent program.

313
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:49,820
They got me hooked up with
a trainee, which is great.

314
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:51,700
I'm getting in
the car.

315
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,490
Can I come with you?

316
00:15:53,529 --> 00:15:56,240
I would feel a lot better if I could
at least see where you were living.

317
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:58,320
Come on. The other
trainees, you know,

318
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,820
they went to fancy
boarding schools

319
00:16:00,870 --> 00:16:02,409
and European exchange
programs.

320
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:05,820
I show up with my mom,
I'll just look like a big dork.

321
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:08,029
Guess that makes sense.

322
00:16:08,029 --> 00:16:09,529
Come here.

323
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,870
I love you.

324
00:16:10,909 --> 00:16:13,240
Let me know the minute
I can visit you.

325
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,159
I'll call you when
I get there, okay?

326
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:21,200
#Freedom, freedom... #

327
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:22,990
Hey, you're gonna
get me a ticket.

328
00:16:23,029 --> 00:16:25,450
# Freedom #

329
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,820
# You got to give
what you take... #

330
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:30,909
- You're crazy.
- # Freedom #

331
00:16:30,950 --> 00:16:33,570
- # Freedom... #
- Sing it again.

332
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,990
# Freedom #

333
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:39,159
#You got to give what you take. #

334
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:44,070
I love that song.

335
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,820
I'm telling you, like the bees,

336
00:16:47,909 --> 00:16:49,990
you're free, girl.

337
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:51,529
That's okay, I'll
take care of it, miss.

338
00:16:51,570 --> 00:16:53,370
Oh, thank you.

339
00:16:53,409 --> 00:16:55,240
I can't believe this.
I could get used to this.

340
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,159
- I'm telling you that.
- Thank God I'm getting a shrink degree.

341
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,909
You know, I love you,
but you're harsh.

342
00:17:00,950 --> 00:17:02,659
A little bit.

343
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:05,160
Just give me a hug.

344
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:08,950
Mwah! I'll see
you soon, I'm sure.

345
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:10,410
Annie?

346
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:14,990
You know the path
of least resistance?

347
00:17:15,029 --> 00:17:16,869
It can lead through
a minefield.

348
00:17:24,869 --> 00:17:26,450
Oh, hi.

349
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:28,910
You are the new nanny?

350
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,660
Yes, and you must
be Maria.

351
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:33,950
- Nice to meet you.
- Hmm.

352
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,119
Can I come in?

353
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,029
Okay.

354
00:17:38,069 --> 00:17:39,740
Leave it there.

355
00:17:39,779 --> 00:17:41,319
The floor is clean.

356
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:43,369
Mmm.

357
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,119
Wow.

358
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,160
This place is
incredible.

359
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:56,779
I hope you last longer
than the last one.

360
00:17:56,819 --> 00:17:58,529
Who, Bertie?
Oh yeah.

361
00:17:58,529 --> 00:18:00,529
Mrs. X told me that she
left to get married.

362
00:18:00,529 --> 00:18:03,490
Married? She had one date
and she get fired.

363
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,529
Oh, Maria? Are you gonna tell
Mrs. X that I've arrived?

364
00:18:09,529 --> 00:18:11,529
Mrs. X is shopping.

365
00:18:11,569 --> 00:18:13,529
But she left you
a note on the table.

366
00:18:13,569 --> 00:18:16,119
Now I have to go run
the vacuum, okay?

367
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,200
Ay...

368
00:18:31,119 --> 00:18:32,529
"Dear Nanny,

369
00:18:32,569 --> 00:18:34,529
welcome!"

370
00:18:34,569 --> 00:18:36,700
Please make note that from here on in,

371
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:40,369
I'm referred to as "Nanny" by all
the people in the Xs' social network.

372
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:43,279
I'm so excited to have you onboard.

373
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:46,240
Please make yourself
completely at home.

374
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:48,990
Manuel is making you
your own set of keys.

375
00:18:49,029 --> 00:18:50,990
Mmm.
- You should have them by tomorrow.

376
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:52,779
The fridge
is well-stocked.

377
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:54,490
Tofu cutlets?

378
00:18:54,529 --> 00:18:56,700
- Ugh.
- Help yourself to anything.

379
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,029
Yuck.

380
00:18:58,029 --> 00:19:00,450
Sorry I could not
be there to meet you

381
00:19:00,490 --> 00:19:03,069
but I'm trying to squeeze
in a little shopping

382
00:19:03,119 --> 00:19:05,069
before my
Parents' Society meeting,

383
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:06,950
which reminds me...

384
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:09,410
please pick Grayer up
from the Christian preschool...

385
00:19:09,450 --> 00:19:11,200
- Wow!
...at 2:15 sharp.

386
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:13,910
It's extremely important
not to be late.

387
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,200
Ooh.

388
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,619
As you can see,

389
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:19,029
I have attached a list
of basic house rules.

390
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:21,819
Hello, Manolo.
- We believe it's important

391
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:25,369
to maintain some sense
of structure in our home

392
00:19:25,369 --> 00:19:27,029
for Grayer's sake.

393
00:19:27,069 --> 00:19:28,660
Rule number one:

394
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:31,369
Grayer and his playmates
are never allowed

395
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,410
- in the master bedroom.
- Oops.

396
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:36,819
Of course, you should refrain from
entering our bedroom as well.

397
00:19:36,869 --> 00:19:38,740
Rule number two:

398
00:19:38,779 --> 00:19:41,029
Grayer is never allowed
to nap during the day.

399
00:19:41,069 --> 00:19:42,369
No naps?

400
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:44,619
This throws his sleeping
schedule completely off.

401
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,569
And I prefer him tired
when I get home.

402
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:51,910
Rule number three:

403
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:54,410
- we just had the walls redone.
- Mm-hm.

404
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:56,569
Please keep Grayer from
rubbing up against them.

405
00:19:56,619 --> 00:19:58,369
- Oh!
- Rule number four:

406
00:19:58,410 --> 00:20:01,069
if school is
ever canceled,

407
00:20:01,119 --> 00:20:04,160
the following nonstructured
outings are permissible...

408
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,369
the Met,

409
00:20:06,410 --> 00:20:08,069
the Morgan Library,

410
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:10,279
the French
Culinary Institute,

411
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:12,319
the New York
Stock Exchange.

412
00:20:12,369 --> 00:20:14,029
Rule number five!

413
00:20:14,069 --> 00:20:16,700
- we do not take
the subway because of germs.

414
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,660
Oh God.

415
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,950
Grayer still must
be in a stroller

416
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:23,160
- when crossing Park or Madison.
- Blah blah blah.

417
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,740
Grayer maintains

418
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:27,779
a high-soy
organic diet.

419
00:20:27,819 --> 00:20:29,319
Rule number eight:

420
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,619
practice French with Grayer
at least three times a week.

421
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,160
His father wants him to
attend Collegiate

422
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,910
where he's currently
wait-listed.

423
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,950
French?
Holy merde.

424
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,200
His acceptance is
a top priority.

425
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,369
Mon Dieu.

426
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,369
Nanny?

427
00:20:47,819 --> 00:20:50,279
Nanny?

428
00:20:50,319 --> 00:20:51,950
- What are you doing?
- The note said

429
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,319
to pick up Grayer
from school at 2:15.

430
00:20:54,369 --> 00:20:55,410
Hm.

431
00:20:55,450 --> 00:20:57,369
And it's only...
it's only 1:00.

432
00:20:57,369 --> 00:21:01,200
So I was a little sweaty from moving
and I thought that I would, you know...

433
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:04,869
What I mean is, what are you
doing in that bathtub?

434
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:07,950
And why are your bags

435
00:21:07,990 --> 00:21:10,160
strewn all over
the guest room?

436
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:13,369
I thought that
was my room.

437
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:14,490
No.

438
00:21:16,450 --> 00:21:18,029
No, Nanny.

439
00:21:20,029 --> 00:21:22,029
This is your room.

440
00:21:22,069 --> 00:21:24,029
Oh.

441
00:21:24,069 --> 00:21:26,319
Okay.

442
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:28,819
Yeah, this is...

443
00:21:28,869 --> 00:21:30,910
very sweet.

444
00:21:32,619 --> 00:21:34,450
Hmm.

445
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:47,779
I'm sorry.
Do you have the time?

446
00:21:47,819 --> 00:21:49,950
2:15.

447
00:21:49,990 --> 00:21:51,869
So they'll be getting out
anytime now?

448
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,200
- 2:45.
- I'm sorry?

449
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:57,990
They get out
every day at 2:45.

450
00:21:58,029 --> 00:22:00,369
Dumbass.

451
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,869
It quickly became clear

452
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:06,529
that Mrs. X had arranged
for me to arrive everywhere

453
00:22:06,569 --> 00:22:08,569
torturously early.

454
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:14,369
Get ready, ladies.
Here they come.

455
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:24,119
Grayer?
Grayer?

456
00:22:26,029 --> 00:22:28,779
- Grayer X?
- Who is it you're looking for?

457
00:22:28,819 --> 00:22:31,619
- Grayer.
- I know that one.

458
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:34,119
He plays with my
wee monster, Darwin.

459
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,410
- Hy-ya!
- Ow!

460
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,410
Oh, Grayer,
there you are.

461
00:22:38,450 --> 00:22:40,369
Hey, little man,
you remember me?

462
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:42,160
Yes, and I hate you!

463
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:45,029
What? Come on, we get
along great, remember?

464
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:47,279
Like when we met
in Central Park?

465
00:22:47,319 --> 00:22:49,119
Let me get
your backpack.

466
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:51,119
Stop. Grayer, stop.

467
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,160
Help, police! She's hurting me!

468
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,410
- They usually start out that way.
- Yes.

469
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:57,319
- Danger, danger!
- Just be patient, eh?

470
00:22:57,369 --> 00:22:59,279
- Let me put you in your stroller, okay?
- It'll get easier.

471
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:01,069
- Hang on one second.
- I'm too big for a stroller!

472
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,450
- Grayer!
- Help!

473
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:03,910
- Grayer!
- Police.

474
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:06,740
Grayer!
Grayer!

475
00:23:06,779 --> 00:23:09,119
Grayer!
Come here!

476
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:11,490
- I hate you, I want Bertie!
- I know, honey.

477
00:23:11,529 --> 00:23:13,740
I know you want Bertie.
Bertie had to leave to get married

478
00:23:13,779 --> 00:23:15,569
or go on a date
or something, okay?

479
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:18,029
But I promise, we're gonna have a lot
of fun together, honestly.

480
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:22,200
All right? Now let me see how handsome
you look in your uniform.

481
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,779
What's that?

482
00:23:25,069 --> 00:23:26,910
- Oh.
- Don't touch that!

483
00:23:26,950 --> 00:23:30,410
It belongs to my daddy!
I hate you. I want Bertie.

484
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,119
Grayer.

485
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,740
Already, one had to wonder...

486
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:36,740
what kind of culture would
turn a father's business card

487
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,660
into a security blanket?

488
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,700
Here we are.

489
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:44,029
Home sweet home.
First mission accomplished.

490
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:48,869
Grayer, get up off the floor.
It's very dirty.

491
00:23:48,910 --> 00:23:50,200
Nuh-uh.

492
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,619
I have an idea.

493
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,450
Why don't we race
to the front door?

494
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,410
Okay, last one there is
a rotten egg.

495
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:59,069
I'm not stupid.
You're just gonna let me win.

496
00:23:59,119 --> 00:24:01,700
No, I am a mighty
good runner, mister.

497
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:04,069
- Not with your pants down.
- Oh my God!

498
00:24:05,990 --> 00:24:08,740
Oh shit!
The stroller!

499
00:24:14,779 --> 00:24:16,910
Shit!
Grayer!

500
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,410
You said a curse.
I'm telling Mommy.

501
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:22,200
Grayer, I am not kidding.
Open this door right now.

502
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,450
- Maria!
- Touch my fingers.

503
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:29,319
- Ow!
- I am not letting go...

504
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:30,990
...until you open the door!

505
00:24:31,029 --> 00:24:32,240
Ow!

506
00:24:35,029 --> 00:24:36,279
Pardon me.

507
00:24:40,279 --> 00:24:42,279
I think this belongs
to Grayer.

508
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:44,369
Rode the elevator to
the 12th floor.

509
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:46,819
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

510
00:24:46,869 --> 00:24:48,819
Sorry, we're having a little
bit of a situation here.

511
00:24:53,569 --> 00:24:55,369
By the way, my name's...

512
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:58,240
Since my job required a vow of chastity,

513
00:24:58,279 --> 00:25:00,740
it was essential that
I avoided all intimacies,

514
00:25:00,779 --> 00:25:02,410
especially first names.

515
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:04,619
For the purpose of
this field diary,

516
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:07,119
let's just call him
Harvard Hottie.

517
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,200
I'm the Xs' new nanny.

518
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,029
- Oh.
- Very new, as you can probably tell.

519
00:25:13,069 --> 00:25:16,869
I'm taking off all my clothes.

520
00:25:16,869 --> 00:25:19,779
Seems to be popular
on this floor.

521
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,740
Mind if I take a crack
at him for you?

522
00:25:23,779 --> 00:25:26,740
Be my guest.

523
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:30,119
Hey, Grayer,
it's your pal from upstairs.

524
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:33,069
Hey, would you be a sport
and unlock the door?

525
00:25:33,119 --> 00:25:35,819
It's not nice to
lock people out.

526
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:37,869
Please, buddy?

527
00:25:40,410 --> 00:25:43,569
- Hey.
- Why are you here?

528
00:25:43,619 --> 00:25:47,779
Oh, I'm just helping out
my new friend.

529
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:50,319
Annie.

530
00:25:50,369 --> 00:25:52,779
Annie.
Annie the nanny.

531
00:25:52,819 --> 00:25:55,029
She's your friend?

532
00:25:55,069 --> 00:25:58,619
Yes, she's my friend.
Isn't she your friend too?

533
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,029
Not yet.

534
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:12,200
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

535
00:26:14,069 --> 00:26:16,819
Suddenly the world's
most notorious loner

536
00:26:16,869 --> 00:26:18,990
had two new men
in her life.

537
00:26:19,029 --> 00:26:23,410
Unfortunately, I knew that
the big one was off-limits.

538
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,319
Based on my observations,

539
00:26:25,369 --> 00:26:28,240
guys like Harvard Hottie
only slum it when they're in college.

540
00:26:28,279 --> 00:26:30,619
So, instead of
following my heart,

541
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:33,819
I focused on finding a way
into Grayer's.

542
00:26:44,119 --> 00:26:47,160
Grayer, stop it.

543
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,279
# Why can't we
be friends? #

544
00:26:50,319 --> 00:26:52,119
Befriending Grayer

545
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:54,279
certainly wasn't easy.

546
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,240
La la la la la la!

547
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,529
But then again, Margaret Mead
didn't run home every time

548
00:27:01,569 --> 00:27:04,410
- she contracted malaria.
- Whoa!

549
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,490
You're in trouble!

550
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:08,660
I thought this job
was supposed to be

551
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:10,450
a way to get
your head together?

552
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:13,740
Two weeks in and you already sound
depressed, dejected and paranoid.

553
00:27:13,779 --> 00:27:16,119
You forgot to mention
malnourished.

554
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:18,910
I swear, all these people eat
is bean curd and seltzer.

555
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:20,160
Ew.

556
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:21,910
I mean, even the ice cream
is made out of tofu.

557
00:27:21,950 --> 00:27:24,319
So why don't you come down
and have dinner with us then?

558
00:27:24,369 --> 00:27:27,319
My new roomie's
making gumbo.

559
00:27:27,369 --> 00:27:29,819
It's not gumbo.
It's Creole bouillabaisse.

560
00:27:29,869 --> 00:27:31,779
I don't get it.

561
00:27:31,819 --> 00:27:35,029
You move to the city and overnight
your life becomes "Will & Grace."

562
00:27:35,069 --> 00:27:36,700
I'm here, knee-deep in...

563
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:39,029
Shit. It's probably my mom.

564
00:27:39,069 --> 00:27:40,369
She's the only one
who has this number.

565
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:41,529
Bye.

566
00:27:41,569 --> 00:27:44,490
- Hello?
- Annie?

567
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:46,200
- Hi.
- My God.

568
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,990
An entire week has gone by
and you haven't called me back.

569
00:27:49,029 --> 00:27:51,529
Mom, I told you I was gonna
be so busy with work.

570
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:53,660
Oh come on.
You can't find five minutes

571
00:27:53,700 --> 00:27:55,200
to call
your worried mother?

572
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,819
How are you, honey?

573
00:27:56,869 --> 00:27:58,910
How's the job?
How's the apartment?

574
00:27:58,950 --> 00:28:02,200
God, everything
is just perfect.

575
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,869
I mean, the job
is a dream.

576
00:28:04,910 --> 00:28:07,369
A little challenging.
So rewarding though.

577
00:28:07,369 --> 00:28:10,490
And the apartment is
just incredible.

578
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:13,660
- Yeah?
- And my roommate could not be nicer.

579
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:15,069
Nanny, in the morning,

580
00:28:15,069 --> 00:28:16,910
I need you to stop at Tiffany's
and pick up Mr. X's watch.

581
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,119
Then I need you to Xerox
the recommendation letters

582
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:20,910
for Grayer's Collegiate
application.

583
00:28:20,950 --> 00:28:24,069
Also, I was thinking, we should
introduce French food into his diet.

584
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:26,569
It might enhance his study
of the language. So tomorrow night,

585
00:28:26,569 --> 00:28:29,490
why don't you make him
coquilles St. Jacques for dinner, hmm?

586
00:28:29,529 --> 00:28:31,619
- Annie?
- Dry cleaning.

587
00:28:31,660 --> 00:28:34,660
Who was that,
your roommate?

588
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,990
Mom, I have to go.
I have some work stuff to take care of.

589
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:39,529
Wait a minute.
I want to make a plan to visit.

590
00:28:39,569 --> 00:28:41,660
Ann...

591
00:28:58,660 --> 00:29:01,619
Hi, ladies.

592
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,660
So I took Madison to
the doctor this morning.

593
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:06,660
She had grown three
inches in six months.

594
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:09,069
You take her to
the doctor too?

595
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:12,160
Darling, I do everything.
My job is a type C.

596
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:14,490
- Mmm.
- Type C? What's type C?

597
00:29:14,529 --> 00:29:17,410
Oh Jesus.
Okay, newbie.

598
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,740
Pay attention, honey.
Basically,

599
00:29:19,779 --> 00:29:22,700
there's three types of nanny gigs.
Okay, type A,

600
00:29:22,740 --> 00:29:26,569
you provide "couple time"
a few nights a week

601
00:29:26,569 --> 00:29:29,660
for women who work all day
and parent at night.

602
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,819
Type B, you provide

603
00:29:31,869 --> 00:29:34,450
"sanity time,"
every afternoon, right,

604
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:37,279
to a woman who mothers in
the mornings and the evenings.

605
00:29:37,319 --> 00:29:39,450
And type C,
the most common,

606
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:42,200
you provide 24-7
"me time"

607
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,319
to the woman who neither
works nor mothers.

608
00:29:45,369 --> 00:29:47,950
So, which one are you?

609
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,910
I am type C,

610
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:53,240
no question.
Although when I started I had no idea.

611
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:57,069
I thought it would be
a kind of fun and easy job.

612
00:29:57,119 --> 00:29:59,700
You'd think
a college graduate

613
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,369
would choose a job
a little more wisely.

614
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:05,160
Actually, this job
kind of chose me.

615
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:08,119
Chose you?

616
00:30:08,160 --> 00:30:11,279
Please, child.
I left my country

617
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:14,529
because I thought I could give my boy
and my sick mother a better life.

618
00:30:14,569 --> 00:30:18,200
I was supposed to be here
two or three years tops.

619
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,819
And while I've been raising
these strangers' children,

620
00:30:20,869 --> 00:30:25,029
my own child has grown up
without a mother.

621
00:30:25,069 --> 00:30:27,200
That's how this job
chose me.

622
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:40,029
Half a tablespoon
of tarragon.

623
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:47,569
That's dried.
I like fresh.

624
00:30:47,619 --> 00:30:51,119
Well, you know what?
Dried's all we got, okay, kiddo?

625
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:53,990
I hate coquilles dry.
I want sushi.

626
00:30:54,029 --> 00:30:56,569
Well, then tell your mother
you want to learn Japanese.

627
00:30:56,619 --> 00:30:57,869
Mmm!

628
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,819
Okay.

629
00:31:05,069 --> 00:31:07,740
Ah!

630
00:31:07,779 --> 00:31:11,700
I'm telling Mommy.
You're in trouble.

631
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,910
Okay.

632
00:31:15,619 --> 00:31:18,569
That's it.

633
00:31:22,319 --> 00:31:25,319
No, Mommy says they're full
of high-fructose corn syrup.

634
00:31:25,369 --> 00:31:27,990
Well, what mommy doesn't know
won't hurt her, okay, Mr. Tattletale?

635
00:31:28,029 --> 00:31:30,619
Eat it.
Go on.

636
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,660
Right out of the jar.

637
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:47,910
It's okay.

638
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:50,910
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

639
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,490
- It's yummy, isn't it?
- This is fun.

640
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:56,869
Yeah?
This is fun. This is fun.

641
00:31:56,869 --> 00:32:01,160
And this fun meal has to
be our little secret, okay?

642
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,160
Okay.

643
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,369
Okay.

644
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:09,200
Hey, you know, we can do
lots of fun things.

645
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,779
We just have to be friends
and we have to trust each other.

646
00:32:11,819 --> 00:32:13,990
- Okay?
- Mmm-hmm.

647
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:18,950
Maybe you should have
a secret name too?

648
00:32:18,990 --> 00:32:21,319
- You want a secret name?
- Yeah, I want a secret name.

649
00:32:21,369 --> 00:32:23,490
Okay.

650
00:32:23,529 --> 00:32:26,240
How about Sponge Bob?

651
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:27,910
- No, silly.
- No?

652
00:32:29,569 --> 00:32:33,410
All right, what about...
what about Grover?

653
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:35,160
Grover,
I love Grover.

654
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:38,700
You do?
All right. Grover it is.

655
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:45,369
Where's my little munchkin?

656
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:47,160
- Daddy! Daddy's home.
- Huh?

657
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:51,200
- Yay, Daddy. Daddy's home.
- I hear him, I hear him.

658
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,450
- Daddy!
- Oh, there he is!

659
00:32:53,490 --> 00:32:55,410
Oh my goodness, I'm sorry.
Are you a little monster?

660
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,279
Remember what happens
to little monsters?

661
00:32:57,319 --> 00:32:58,619
- Come here for a minute.
- No, Daddy!

662
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:01,029
You remember?
What's wrong with you?

663
00:33:01,069 --> 00:33:02,660
- Daddy!
- Come here for a minute.

664
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:05,319
You get viciously tickled.
You remember that?

665
00:33:05,369 --> 00:33:06,779
- Daddy, stop it.
- Huh? Hey.

666
00:33:06,819 --> 00:33:08,529
- You my little superstar?
- Yeah.

667
00:33:08,569 --> 00:33:10,869
Are you? Are you gonna
take over the world?

668
00:33:10,910 --> 00:33:12,990
Come on, answer me.
You gonna take over the world?

669
00:33:13,069 --> 00:33:15,029
- Yes.
- And when are you gonna do it?

670
00:33:15,069 --> 00:33:17,279
- Next year.
- Next year's not soon enough.

671
00:33:17,319 --> 00:33:20,369
Well, you must be Mr. X.
I'm the new nanny.

672
00:33:20,410 --> 00:33:22,910
Yeah. Keep him
quiet tonight, will you?

673
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,619
I've got a merger
I'm working on.

674
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,319
I don't get some
decent shut-eye tonight,

675
00:33:26,369 --> 00:33:28,029
somebody around here's
gonna be accountable.

676
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:29,869
Daddy, come see
my dinosaur!

677
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,410
- Daddy's got work to do, buddy.
- Please?

678
00:33:36,990 --> 00:33:40,069
Hey, Grayer, don't...
don't be sad. It's okay.

679
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:43,200
Daddy's just tired.

680
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,700
Grover.

681
00:33:49,119 --> 00:33:51,700
Hey, you want to
finish our fun meal?

682
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:54,779
Come on!

683
00:33:54,819 --> 00:33:56,779
Yeah.

684
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,990
# Frère Jacques #

685
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:02,700
# Frère Jacques #

686
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:06,369
# Dormez vous,
dormez vous #

687
00:34:06,410 --> 00:34:09,989
# Sonnez les matines,
sonnez les matines. #

688
00:34:10,030 --> 00:34:11,699
Nanny?

689
00:34:11,739 --> 00:34:13,070
Yeah, Grover?

690
00:34:15,369 --> 00:34:18,449
You'll never leave me
like Bertie, will you?

691
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:25,869
- Grover, you know I...
- Promise?

692
00:34:29,369 --> 00:34:32,869
I'm not going anywhere.
You know that, right, honey?

693
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:38,239
Right, Grove?

694
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,619
# Oh beautiful... #

695
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:57,409
Dear Nanny,

696
00:34:57,449 --> 00:35:00,070
please remember that
today is the 4th of July family party

697
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:01,780
at Mr. X's office.

698
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,949
It probably slipped your mind
that costumes are required,

699
00:35:04,989 --> 00:35:08,199
so I took it upon myself
to have some delivered.

700
00:35:08,239 --> 00:35:11,199
- This is itchy.
- I know, sweetheart.

701
00:35:11,199 --> 00:35:13,909
Why do we have to
dress up?

702
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:15,949
Freedom, Grove.

703
00:35:15,989 --> 00:35:18,530
It's all in the name
of freedom.

704
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,619
Hey, guys.

705
00:35:20,659 --> 00:35:23,030
- Who is that?
- That's the nanny, dear.

706
00:35:23,070 --> 00:35:25,619
- You've met her.
- What happened to Louisa?

707
00:35:27,070 --> 00:35:30,199
That was two nannies
ago, silly.

708
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:33,739
- Yeah.
- Daddy, I'm George Washington.

709
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,320
- Okay.
- Tickle me.

710
00:35:35,369 --> 00:35:37,489
No, I understand that,
Dan, because the bastard's selling low.

711
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:39,489
- Please!
- Grayer, come on, buddy.

712
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:41,489
Cut it out, sit down.

713
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,989
- Yes yes, we're coming.
- No, it's just my kid.

714
00:35:44,030 --> 00:35:45,659
- We're coming.
- Right.

715
00:35:45,699 --> 00:35:47,820
- Well no, that's what I was thinking...
- You want me to call...

716
00:35:47,869 --> 00:35:50,409
Where's my card! Daddy!
- Your what?

717
00:35:50,449 --> 00:35:53,239
Where's my card!
Oh, I wanna go home!

718
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:55,030
Hey, smile, Grove.
We're gonna go to a party.

719
00:35:55,070 --> 00:35:58,159
That's not my card.
Where's my card?

720
00:35:58,199 --> 00:35:59,989
Would you get off that phone

721
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:02,239
and tell the nanny to
give him his damn card?

722
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,159
Nanny?
Turn the car around.

723
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:07,369
- Talk to the nanny, please.
- Nanny, go back and get the card.

724
00:36:07,409 --> 00:36:09,949
Hold the elevator!

725
00:36:16,199 --> 00:36:18,320
I'm sorry.

726
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:21,369
It's okay, don't be.
At least I'm fully dressed this time.

727
00:36:21,409 --> 00:36:23,489
So...

728
00:36:25,199 --> 00:36:26,820
I'm so sorry.
It's not funny.

729
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:29,489
I don't mean to be laughing.

730
00:36:29,530 --> 00:36:31,619
You look very
patriotic.

731
00:36:31,659 --> 00:36:33,369
- Yeah.
- Let me hit your floor.

732
00:36:33,409 --> 00:36:34,869
Oh, that's okay.
I got it.

733
00:36:34,909 --> 00:36:37,820
Didn't grow up with the staff
doing everything for me,

734
00:36:37,869 --> 00:36:40,239
- so...
- Neither did I.

735
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:43,820
Really? You must have had
it really rough then.

736
00:36:43,869 --> 00:36:47,619
Okay, well, I'm glad
to give you a good laugh.

737
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:03,239
My husband and I are
taking our second honeymoon

738
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,320
in Provence.

739
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:09,280
# When I dance they
call me Macarena #

740
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,699
# And the boys,
they say that I'm buena #

741
00:37:11,739 --> 00:37:14,070
# They all want me,
they can't have me #

742
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:16,659
# So they all come
and dance beside me #

743
00:37:16,699 --> 00:37:18,820
# Move with me,
jam with me... #

744
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:23,030
I'm looking for Mr. X.
Have you seen him?

745
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:25,119
No, sorry.

746
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,159
Wouldn't know him if I did.

747
00:37:27,199 --> 00:37:29,530
# Macarena,
hey, Macarena... #

748
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:32,570
Grove, come on. What is wrong?
Why won't you shake your booty?

749
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:34,619
'Cause I have to
make a doodie.

750
00:37:34,659 --> 00:37:36,659
Oh.
Come on.

751
00:37:46,869 --> 00:37:49,199
Hey, Grover, I think
the bathroom's the other way.

752
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:51,659
- My daddy has one in his office.
- Yeah?

753
00:37:51,699 --> 00:37:54,119
- I wanna go to my daddy's bathroom.
- Okay.

754
00:38:00,909 --> 00:38:03,780
- Oh.
- Why is Daddy tickling that lady?

755
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:05,619
I'm sorry.

756
00:38:05,659 --> 00:38:07,820
Grayer just had to use
the bathroom.

757
00:38:09,739 --> 00:38:12,199
So use it already.

758
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:16,909
Hello, Grayer.
Remember me?

759
00:38:16,949 --> 00:38:18,909
I work with your daddy
in the Chicago office.

760
00:38:18,949 --> 00:38:21,780
Let go.
I have to make a doodie.

761
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,159
Oh.

762
00:38:27,909 --> 00:38:31,239
So, you must
be the nanny.

763
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:34,699
Uh, yes, I...

764
00:38:34,739 --> 00:38:38,659
I'll get out of your...
I'll wait in the hall.

765
00:38:42,159 --> 00:38:43,780
So sorry.

766
00:38:50,989 --> 00:38:53,030
Grayer, hurry up.
Your mom's coming.

767
00:38:53,070 --> 00:38:56,320
Sweetie, did Grayer hear
from the waiting-list committee yet?

768
00:38:56,369 --> 00:38:58,119
No, why?

769
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:00,030
Oh, I'm sure it
doesn't mean anything,

770
00:39:00,030 --> 00:39:01,780
but the Bairds did
and Darwin got in.

771
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:09,659
Please don't say anything about
Collegiate or Darwin to my husband.

772
00:39:09,699 --> 00:39:11,659
Sure.

773
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:17,530
- Oh, hi, pumpkin.
- There you are.

774
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:19,989
Oh, you've met before
in Chicago, right?

775
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:21,449
- Yes, hello.
- Lovely to see you.

776
00:39:21,489 --> 00:39:23,570
- Nice to see you as well.
- Excuse me. Thanks again.

777
00:39:23,619 --> 00:39:25,320
- Mm-hm.
- Where have you been?

778
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:27,119
Making calls.
Where's the chow?

779
00:39:27,159 --> 00:39:29,070
- The entire time?
- Yeah.

780
00:39:34,119 --> 00:39:37,530
Male monogamy remains an elusive,

781
00:39:37,530 --> 00:39:39,780
yet much
mythologized practice

782
00:39:39,820 --> 00:39:41,449
throughout the world.

783
00:39:41,489 --> 00:39:43,949
In many Bedouin tribes,

784
00:39:43,989 --> 00:39:47,699
powerful men are encouraged
to take multiple wives.

785
00:39:48,909 --> 00:39:50,820
In contemporary France,

786
00:39:50,869 --> 00:39:52,780
mistresses are de rigueur

787
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:55,320
and quietly tolerated.

788
00:39:55,369 --> 00:39:57,989
But for the women
of the Upper East Side,

789
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:02,030
adultery is
pathologically ignored.

790
00:40:03,739 --> 00:40:06,739
Nobody warned me we were going
to have a therapy session.

791
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:09,659
It's just that I didn't
see you at all at the party.

792
00:40:09,699 --> 00:40:12,659
Well, I was trying to
sneak in a little work.

793
00:40:12,699 --> 00:40:15,369
Okay? Forgive me
for making a living.

794
00:40:15,409 --> 00:40:18,989
But everybody else
was participating.

795
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:23,449
Everybody else doesn't pull
down what I do every year.

796
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:26,369
I had my family there
and I was present and accounted for.

797
00:40:26,369 --> 00:40:29,369
So now, you know, I would really
appreciate a moment of peace and quiet.

798
00:40:29,409 --> 00:40:30,949
'Cause frankly,
I'm exhausted.

799
00:40:33,280 --> 00:40:35,489
Bonjour, Pierre.

800
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:37,570
Bonjour.

801
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:40,909
Comment allez-vous?

802
00:40:44,030 --> 00:40:45,320
Bien, merci.

803
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:47,159
Et vous?

804
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:50,739
Ah, comme ci comme ça.

805
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,409
Okay, I got
a great idea.

806
00:40:56,449 --> 00:41:00,409
Let's pretend that
we're in a cave.

807
00:41:00,409 --> 00:41:02,820
You know what, Nanny?

808
00:41:02,869 --> 00:41:04,489
What, Grove?

809
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,949
I love you best.

810
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:11,989
The other nannies
had warned me about this very moment,

811
00:41:12,030 --> 00:41:13,989
the moment when you'll
be tempted to break

812
00:41:14,070 --> 00:41:16,030
the cardinal rule
of nannydom.

813
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:20,949
And yet, staring into those big,
sad, searching eyes,

814
00:41:20,989 --> 00:41:23,989
I simply couldn't resist.

815
00:41:24,030 --> 00:41:26,369
I love you too, Grove.

816
00:41:28,409 --> 00:41:32,820
Three little words made leaving
this job 1,000 times harder.

817
00:41:32,869 --> 00:41:34,619
...hear a thing I have to say!

818
00:41:34,659 --> 00:41:37,280
I know that you work hard.
I just think

819
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,699
that if... if we're
gonna have more children...

820
00:41:41,739 --> 00:41:44,820
Well, maybe you should
focus on the one you already have.

821
00:41:44,869 --> 00:41:47,949
'Cause you can barely
handle him as it is.

822
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:51,489
Why are you
so cruel to me?

823
00:41:51,530 --> 00:41:53,320
- Why?
- Why are you so cruel?

824
00:41:53,369 --> 00:41:56,030
Because I cannot take
the additional pressure.

825
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:59,369
You know something? I think that
I am going to go out to Chicago

826
00:41:59,409 --> 00:42:01,909
- until this merger is finished.
- Will you stop it, please?

827
00:42:01,909 --> 00:42:04,739
And I certainly hope that
you're in a better mood...

828
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:08,070
- Please, stop it.
...when I come back. All right?

829
00:42:08,119 --> 00:42:10,280
If I come back!

830
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:27,869
Nanny, this is yours,
is it not?

831
00:42:33,070 --> 00:42:36,159
Uh... no, l...

832
00:42:36,199 --> 00:42:37,989
no, I don't know
what that is.

833
00:42:38,030 --> 00:42:41,070
It was in our laundry.

834
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:44,199
It is not mine,
it is not Mr. X's,

835
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:46,909
so it has to be yours,
right?

836
00:42:48,409 --> 00:42:51,030
Right?

837
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:53,070
Yes, it's mine.

838
00:42:55,119 --> 00:42:58,239
Please don't leave your personal items
lying around the house again.

839
00:43:00,030 --> 00:43:01,949
l... I won't.

840
00:43:01,989 --> 00:43:04,659
- I promise. I'm sorry.
- Apology accepted.

841
00:43:14,409 --> 00:43:16,909
I don't mean...

842
00:43:16,949 --> 00:43:19,820
to be a control freak.

843
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:28,369
It's... it's just that when Mr. X
is in the middle of a big deal,

844
00:43:28,409 --> 00:43:30,699
it can be very hard on me.

845
00:43:33,570 --> 00:43:35,699
I understand.

846
00:43:47,659 --> 00:43:50,570
How is Grayer doing?

847
00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:52,780
Grayer?

848
00:43:52,820 --> 00:43:55,659
He's... he's fine.

849
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:58,199
He's great.

850
00:43:58,239 --> 00:44:00,119
That's good to hear.

851
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:03,699
He really is
a wonderful child, isn't he?

852
00:44:07,780 --> 00:44:10,199
He's the best.

853
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:13,159
He's...
he's such a sweet...

854
00:44:13,199 --> 00:44:15,320
Okay, good night then.

855
00:44:21,449 --> 00:44:23,570
Dear Nanny, I know it's Sunday

856
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:25,159
and you requested
a day off,

857
00:44:25,199 --> 00:44:27,239
but I desperately need
to sleep in.

858
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:29,489
I have a very long
afternoon today

859
00:44:29,530 --> 00:44:31,659
tasting caterers
for our benefit,

860
00:44:31,699 --> 00:44:34,369
"Conga for the Congo."
Please don't wake me

861
00:44:34,369 --> 00:44:36,780
unless Mr. X calls
from Chicago.

862
00:44:36,820 --> 00:44:38,409
And most importantly,

863
00:44:38,449 --> 00:44:40,909
find a way to
keep the boy quiet.

864
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:43,070
Why don't they just
muzzle the kid already?

865
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:44,570
What's a muzzle?

866
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:48,320
Scrambled for you
and Cheerios for the boy.

867
00:44:48,369 --> 00:44:50,659
Mommy doesn't allow me
to eat sugar cereal.

868
00:44:50,699 --> 00:44:52,659
Cheerios are sugar-free.

869
00:44:52,699 --> 00:44:55,320
Low in sugar isn't
the same as sugar-free.

870
00:44:55,369 --> 00:44:56,949
Grover, just eat it.

871
00:45:00,239 --> 00:45:01,820
Is that caffeinated?

872
00:45:01,869 --> 00:45:03,869
Mommy doesn't
use caffeine.

873
00:45:03,909 --> 00:45:06,199
That's because Mommy
sleeps till noon.

874
00:45:06,239 --> 00:45:08,530
Perhaps it might be a nice morning

875
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:10,780
to do something
educational with Grayer,

876
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:12,869
like the Pissarro show
at the Guggenheim.

877
00:45:12,869 --> 00:45:15,699
Mommy said you're supposed to take
me to her favorite museum,

878
00:45:15,739 --> 00:45:17,119
the "Guggyheiny."

879
00:45:17,159 --> 00:45:18,869
Well, since today was
supposed to be my day off,

880
00:45:18,909 --> 00:45:21,489
we're gonna go to my favorite,
the Museum of Natural History.

881
00:45:21,530 --> 00:45:23,780
- Isn't that on the West Side?
- Yeah, so?

882
00:45:23,820 --> 00:45:26,820
I'm not allowed to go on the West Side.
That's a rule.

883
00:45:26,869 --> 00:45:30,530
Well, today just happens to
be break-the-rules day.

884
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:32,739
Oh.

885
00:45:39,949 --> 00:45:42,320
Hi.
Two please.

886
00:46:13,199 --> 00:46:15,570
Hey, you know what
the biggest word in America is?

887
00:46:15,619 --> 00:46:16,739
What?

888
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:19,949
Anti...
antidisestablishmentarianism.

889
00:46:19,989 --> 00:46:22,159
Hey, that's pretty good,
Grove.

890
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:24,030
Actually, I know
a longer word.

891
00:46:24,070 --> 00:46:26,530
- There is no longer word.
- Yes, there is.

892
00:46:26,570 --> 00:46:29,070
Supercalifragilistic-
expialidocious.

893
00:46:29,119 --> 00:46:31,320
Wow.
What does that mean?

894
00:46:31,369 --> 00:46:34,369
Come on inside.
Let me show you.

895
00:46:34,409 --> 00:46:37,659
"The apatosaurus, formerly
known as the brontosaurus,

896
00:46:37,699 --> 00:46:39,949
is from a family of
enormous herbivores."

897
00:46:39,989 --> 00:46:42,409
Herbivores means
vegetarian.

898
00:46:42,409 --> 00:46:44,199
Like Mommy,
you know?

899
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:46,280
What's that over there?

900
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:51,659
That is the T-rex.

901
00:46:51,699 --> 00:46:54,280
- Is that one like Mommy too?
- Hmm.

902
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,119
I wish my ancestors
made totem poles.

903
00:46:57,159 --> 00:46:59,030
Well, they did.
That one looks just like you.

904
00:46:59,070 --> 00:47:00,239
It does.

905
00:47:00,280 --> 00:47:01,570
Well, that guy has
a big...

906
00:47:01,619 --> 00:47:03,820
It's hanging.

907
00:47:08,119 --> 00:47:10,070
Cool.
What are they?

908
00:47:10,119 --> 00:47:11,699
They're a Matis
family.

909
00:47:11,739 --> 00:47:13,699
They live in
the Amazon.

910
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:16,119
Which one's the nanny?

911
00:47:16,159 --> 00:47:20,199
She has the day off. Things are
different in that part of the world.

912
00:47:21,909 --> 00:47:24,159
And Nanny, one last thing

913
00:47:24,199 --> 00:47:26,820
before you take
the rest of the day off:

914
00:47:26,869 --> 00:47:30,030
Do you think you could
manage a quick shop for me?

915
00:47:34,280 --> 00:47:36,239
- I'll help.
- No, it's okay, Grayer.

916
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:38,739
Don't.
Grayer, don't... don't!

917
00:47:38,739 --> 00:47:40,449
God!

918
00:47:40,489 --> 00:47:42,489
Mommy!

919
00:47:42,530 --> 00:47:45,070
What a mess.

920
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:47,869
Really, Nanny, I don't know
why you didn't leave all this

921
00:47:47,909 --> 00:47:49,989
downstairs with Manuel
to store.

922
00:47:50,030 --> 00:47:52,989
I mean, am I supposed to have this lying
around the apartment till the benefit?

923
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:56,159
No no no, of course not. l... I'm gonna
bring it down to him right now.

924
00:47:56,199 --> 00:47:58,820
There's no time now.

925
00:47:58,869 --> 00:48:01,369
I need you to get ready for the Nanny
Conflict Resolution Seminar

926
00:48:01,409 --> 00:48:03,199
at the Parents' Society.

927
00:48:03,239 --> 00:48:05,989
I totally forgot
it was this evening.

928
00:48:06,030 --> 00:48:08,239
Um...

929
00:48:13,869 --> 00:48:16,320
Mrs. X, I...

930
00:48:16,369 --> 00:48:18,489
don't know
if you remember,

931
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:20,699
but l... I was supposed
to have the evening off.

932
00:48:20,739 --> 00:48:23,159
And I made plans.

933
00:48:26,739 --> 00:48:28,820
The entire point of
the seminar

934
00:48:28,869 --> 00:48:30,869
is that everybody
brings their nanny.

935
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,739
Are you suggesting
I attend it alone?

936
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:37,239
Huh-uh. No.

937
00:48:37,239 --> 00:48:39,369
I was just...

938
00:48:39,409 --> 00:48:41,070
I was confused.

939
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,820
So, I will
cancel my plans.

940
00:48:44,869 --> 00:48:47,239
I'd appreciate it.

941
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:55,369
Does anyone have
an extra diaper I can use?

942
00:48:55,409 --> 00:48:58,159
Stop eating them boogers!

943
00:48:58,199 --> 00:49:01,570
Grayer, no nudity.
Please.

944
00:49:01,619 --> 00:49:03,739
Of course you feel anxiety

945
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:06,409
when leaving
your kids with strangers.

946
00:49:06,449 --> 00:49:08,699
You're moms.
Okay...

947
00:49:08,739 --> 00:49:11,199
now what I would
love to do

948
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:13,449
is bring in
the nannies.

949
00:49:13,489 --> 00:49:15,989
Linda, Gillian, would you
mind monitoring the children

950
00:49:16,030 --> 00:49:18,030
so that the nannies can
join us in here?

951
00:49:18,070 --> 00:49:20,530
Okay, listen, I want to see
you all here next week.

952
00:49:20,570 --> 00:49:23,070
The seminar is called
"Sexy Mom, Happy Mom."

953
00:49:23,070 --> 00:49:25,570
It's gonna be
a hot one.

954
00:49:25,619 --> 00:49:27,489
Nannies, we're ready.

955
00:49:27,530 --> 00:49:29,619
Right this way, ladies.

956
00:49:29,659 --> 00:49:32,159
All right, here they are...

957
00:49:32,199 --> 00:49:34,820
the nannies!
Wonderful. Come on in.

958
00:49:34,869 --> 00:49:38,320
Just... just file against this wall.
Just squeeze in.

959
00:49:38,369 --> 00:49:40,530
But... but be comfortable.

960
00:49:40,570 --> 00:49:43,369
Terrific.
Now that we're all together,

961
00:49:43,369 --> 00:49:46,199
I think it's time to address
the reason for this seminar:

962
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:50,030
improving nanny-mom
communication.

963
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:53,820
To begin, I would like
a mom volunteer

964
00:49:53,869 --> 00:49:56,530
to offer the group
one particular example

965
00:49:56,570 --> 00:49:58,530
of failed communication
with your nanny.

966
00:49:58,570 --> 00:50:00,570
Most of them
barely speak English.

967
00:50:00,619 --> 00:50:03,409
- That's the problem.
- Okay, you.

968
00:50:03,449 --> 00:50:06,199
My nanny keeps on singing
religious songs to Parker

969
00:50:06,239 --> 00:50:09,159
even though I have told her
time and time again that we're agnostic.

970
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:11,699
And what's worse,
every time I confront her

971
00:50:11,739 --> 00:50:14,869
she flatly denies it,
even after I provided her

972
00:50:14,909 --> 00:50:16,570
with evidence
from the Nanny Cam.

973
00:50:16,619 --> 00:50:19,949
Nanny Cam?
I thought that was an urban myth.

974
00:50:19,989 --> 00:50:21,869
That's my nanny over there.

975
00:50:21,909 --> 00:50:24,869
Will you please ask her
if she's trying to convert my child?

976
00:50:24,909 --> 00:50:28,570
No. Right now we're
just hearing issues.

977
00:50:28,619 --> 00:50:32,570
Okay. Next I would like
to hear from a nanny.

978
00:50:32,619 --> 00:50:34,909
Can I have a nanny
volunteer?

979
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:36,869
Anyone?

980
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:38,449
Por favor?

981
00:50:38,489 --> 00:50:41,909
Come on,
don't be shy.

982
00:50:41,909 --> 00:50:45,159
We won't bite.

983
00:50:45,199 --> 00:50:47,369
Okay, how about you,
young lady?

984
00:50:47,409 --> 00:50:49,159
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

985
00:50:49,199 --> 00:50:52,739
Can you share with the group
one particular grievance

986
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:56,030
that you might have
about your job?

987
00:50:56,070 --> 00:50:57,739
Come on.

988
00:50:57,780 --> 00:51:01,159
No no, l-l...
I love my job.

989
00:51:01,199 --> 00:51:04,199
I do. I feel...
I feel kinda lucky.

990
00:51:04,239 --> 00:51:06,030
Oh, that's very nice,

991
00:51:06,070 --> 00:51:08,320
but neither helpful
nor productive.

992
00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:11,530
So can you please offer
the class something useful? Come on.

993
00:51:13,369 --> 00:51:16,869
- Well...
- Yeah?

994
00:51:16,909 --> 00:51:20,449
It would be nice to
have a night off, I guess.

995
00:51:20,489 --> 00:51:22,489
Uh-huh.

996
00:51:22,570 --> 00:51:26,369
We... we have been a little
preoccupied with our benefit.

997
00:51:28,030 --> 00:51:29,909
But all she has to do
is ask.

998
00:51:29,949 --> 00:51:32,869
Uh-huh-huh-huh.
See, ladies?

999
00:51:32,869 --> 00:51:35,369
Conflict resolved.

1000
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:47,409
- I'm taking him.
- Oh no, I can take him.

1001
00:51:47,449 --> 00:51:49,409
- No, it's all right.
- No, I can... I can take him.

1002
00:51:49,449 --> 00:51:52,949
Nanny, please.
I want you to go out.

1003
00:51:52,989 --> 00:51:55,869
It's only 9:00.
You clearly wanted the evening off.

1004
00:51:55,909 --> 00:51:58,489
No... no, you must be
exhausted, let me put him to bed.

1005
00:51:58,530 --> 00:52:00,780
We'll manage fine.
Here.

1006
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,820
Have a blast.

1007
00:52:11,619 --> 00:52:14,070
I just don't understand it.

1008
00:52:16,369 --> 00:52:19,699
l... I just don't understand
how someone can have everything

1009
00:52:19,739 --> 00:52:21,989
and still be...

1010
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:24,619
so miserable.

1011
00:52:25,949 --> 00:52:27,909
Anyway...

1012
00:52:27,949 --> 00:52:31,409
remember I was telling you
I went to this orientation mixer thingy?

1013
00:52:31,409 --> 00:52:34,030
I met this guy who
likes the same exact...

1014
00:52:34,070 --> 00:52:37,909
It's like she dumps all of her problems
with her husband onto me.

1015
00:52:37,949 --> 00:52:40,909
It's called denial.
Okay, like the river.

1016
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:43,659
And you obviously have
become her enabler.

1017
00:52:43,699 --> 00:52:45,489
What? What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

1018
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:48,159
It means, can you stop talking about
this woman for five minutes please?

1019
00:52:48,199 --> 00:52:50,989
Well, I'm sorry I'm boring you, Lynette,
but this is my life right now.

1020
00:52:51,030 --> 00:52:53,320
I have a life too,
in case you haven't noticed.

1021
00:52:53,369 --> 00:52:55,909
And I'm starting to think
you and that lady

1022
00:52:55,949 --> 00:52:57,739
are kindred spirits.

1023
00:52:59,530 --> 00:53:02,199
You know what? NYU should give you
your diploma right now.

1024
00:53:02,239 --> 00:53:04,280
- You've got all the answers.
- Okay okay.

1025
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:06,780
Okay, let's forget that...
forget that.

1026
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:09,869
Can we at least try
to have a good time?

1027
00:53:09,909 --> 00:53:12,199
Since you did drag me
above 14th Street.

1028
00:53:12,239 --> 00:53:13,280
Mmh.

1029
00:53:15,070 --> 00:53:16,820
Come on, Annie.
This place,

1030
00:53:16,869 --> 00:53:18,570
you have to admit,
it's...

1031
00:53:18,619 --> 00:53:20,489
hmm, tired.

1032
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:22,869
Look at these guys
over there.

1033
00:53:22,909 --> 00:53:25,280
They don't have
any piercings,

1034
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,659
no tattoos.
I mean...

1035
00:53:26,699 --> 00:53:28,199
Oh my God.

1036
00:53:28,239 --> 00:53:30,409
- We have to go right now.
- Wha... why?

1037
00:53:30,449 --> 00:53:33,369
- Wait a minute.
- The guy I told you about is here.

1038
00:53:33,409 --> 00:53:34,909
Harvard Hottie?

1039
00:53:34,949 --> 00:53:37,619
- Mmm.
- Which one? Which one, where?

1040
00:53:37,659 --> 00:53:41,320
Yankees cap, blue shirt,
blue blood.

1041
00:53:41,369 --> 00:53:43,739
Mmm.
He is gorgeous.

1042
00:53:43,780 --> 00:53:45,070
Yeah, okay, let's go.

1043
00:53:45,119 --> 00:53:46,909
No no no, are you out of your mind?
You kidding me?

1044
00:53:46,949 --> 00:53:48,780
No, I'm out of
my league, okay?

1045
00:53:48,820 --> 00:53:50,199
Let's go.

1046
00:53:50,239 --> 00:53:52,070
Oops.

1047
00:53:54,070 --> 00:53:55,659
What the hell
are you doing?

1048
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:58,739
Oh my God, I know that girl.
Annie!

1049
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:00,780
Annie!

1050
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:02,449
Come on, have a drink
with him already.

1051
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,780
I told you, I can't
date on the job.

1052
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:07,159
Are you gonna use this job as an excuse
for everything or what?

1053
00:54:07,199 --> 00:54:08,280
Say hello
to the nice fella.

1054
00:54:08,320 --> 00:54:10,489
- Hey.
- Guys, this is Annie.

1055
00:54:10,530 --> 00:54:12,119
I don't know your name.
I'm sorry.

1056
00:54:12,159 --> 00:54:14,280
- Oh, Lynette.
- Hi, how are you? Nice to meet you.

1057
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:17,030
Some buddies from high school...
this is Carter, Jojo,

1058
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:19,989
- John, Kenny, Reggie.
- Hello.

1059
00:54:20,030 --> 00:54:21,699
- Nice to meet you.
- Sit, grab a chair.

1060
00:54:21,739 --> 00:54:23,949
- Oh no, we can't.
- We'd love to.

1061
00:54:24,949 --> 00:54:27,030
Yeah.

1062
00:54:28,369 --> 00:54:32,369
So, girls, tell us,
how do you know our boy here?

1063
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:36,489
Oh, I really don't know him.
He's Annie's friend.

1064
00:54:38,159 --> 00:54:41,119
I know him from work.

1065
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:44,449
Oh yeah?
What kind of work do you do?

1066
00:54:44,489 --> 00:54:47,280
Model?

1067
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,320
- Stewardess?
- Escort?

1068
00:54:51,739 --> 00:54:53,989
She works for someone
in my building.

1069
00:54:54,030 --> 00:54:55,869
Oh.

1070
00:54:55,869 --> 00:54:57,280
Actually, I'm a nanny.

1071
00:54:57,320 --> 00:55:00,070
A nanny?

1072
00:55:00,119 --> 00:55:02,119
Dude!

1073
00:55:02,159 --> 00:55:04,530
You didn't tell us
you knew a nanny.

1074
00:55:04,570 --> 00:55:06,869
That is so porno.

1075
00:55:06,909 --> 00:55:08,619
- Are the moms hot?
- Guys.

1076
00:55:08,659 --> 00:55:11,739
- Are you hot for the dads?
- Are the dads hot for you?

1077
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:14,320
- Hey, come on.
- You want to know about the dads?

1078
00:55:14,369 --> 00:55:17,030
I'll tell you about
the dads.

1079
00:55:17,070 --> 00:55:19,199
They're chubby, bald,
steak-eating,

1080
00:55:19,199 --> 00:55:21,070
cigar-smoking,
type-A pigs

1081
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:24,570
who get more turned on by the Bloomberg
Wire than they do by any hot nannies.

1082
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:28,369
Actually, it's all of you
in about five years.

1083
00:55:28,409 --> 00:55:30,369
Enjoy tonight,

1084
00:55:30,409 --> 00:55:33,320
because your future looks
pretty fucking bleak.

1085
00:55:33,369 --> 00:55:34,989
- Wait.
- God!

1086
00:55:38,869 --> 00:55:41,530
Stupid stupid.

1087
00:55:45,070 --> 00:55:47,699
You have two new messages.

1088
00:55:47,739 --> 00:55:49,949
Hey, Annie, it's me,

1089
00:55:49,989 --> 00:55:52,699
the... the big jerk
from the bar.

1090
00:55:52,739 --> 00:55:54,199
- What?
- Listen...

1091
00:55:54,239 --> 00:55:56,119
in case you're wondering,
your friend Lynette

1092
00:55:56,159 --> 00:55:57,820
- gave me your home number.
- Ex-friend.

1093
00:55:57,869 --> 00:55:59,659
I obviously owe you
a major apology.

1094
00:55:59,699 --> 00:56:01,949
Please just don't judge me
by my loser friends.

1095
00:56:01,989 --> 00:56:03,619
- Mm-hm.
- They were pretty hammered.

1096
00:56:03,659 --> 00:56:05,780
Anyway, I want you to
give me an opportunity

1097
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:08,119
to redeem myself
by taking you out.

1098
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:10,119
And I'm warning you,
I won't take no for an answer.

1099
00:56:10,159 --> 00:56:12,949
I know where you live, so I'll camp out
at your door if I have to.

1100
00:56:12,989 --> 00:56:14,869
You really might as well
just get this over with.

1101
00:56:14,869 --> 00:56:16,530
And if you really hate me
after that...

1102
00:56:16,530 --> 00:56:18,530
I'll... I'll never
ask you again.

1103
00:56:18,530 --> 00:56:21,320
Okay, I'm sorry to ramble.
If I don't hear from you,

1104
00:56:21,369 --> 00:56:23,409
I'll ride the elevator
till I find you.

1105
00:56:23,449 --> 00:56:24,659
Bye.

1106
00:56:26,869 --> 00:56:28,869
I am so screwed.

1107
00:56:30,119 --> 00:56:32,030
Annie, it's your mother.

1108
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:35,320
Look, I'm sorry that I didn't
call last night, okay?

1109
00:56:35,369 --> 00:56:37,780
I had a really late night.
But about tonight...

1110
00:56:37,820 --> 00:56:41,119
Okay, you know what?
I don't want to hear it. I'm coming.

1111
00:56:41,159 --> 00:56:42,989
- I am coming.
- All right, fine.

1112
00:56:43,030 --> 00:56:44,869
Fine... okay, let me...

1113
00:56:44,909 --> 00:56:46,820
let me just call you
after this play date, okay?

1114
00:56:46,869 --> 00:56:48,869
Play date?
What the hell is a play date?

1115
00:56:48,909 --> 00:56:52,909
- Oh shit.
- You said a curse!

1116
00:56:52,949 --> 00:56:56,369
Um, you know, Mom.
A play date...

1117
00:56:56,369 --> 00:56:59,949
it's the meeting of
preliminary investment schedules.

1118
00:56:59,989 --> 00:57:02,659
Look, I'll call you
later, okay?

1119
00:57:02,699 --> 00:57:05,780
All right. Bye.

1120
00:57:08,159 --> 00:57:10,199
Who lives here?

1121
00:57:10,239 --> 00:57:12,449
Some kid named Jefferson.

1122
00:57:12,489 --> 00:57:15,199
Your mom found him
with the Park Avenue play-date service.

1123
00:57:15,239 --> 00:57:17,030
Hi, y'all.

1124
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:20,119
I'm Jefferson's
mama Tanya.

1125
00:57:20,159 --> 00:57:21,489
Come on in.

1126
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:24,239
We're baking a cake.

1127
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:26,030
Oh my God.

1128
00:57:26,070 --> 00:57:28,739
Come on, y'all!

1129
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:30,989
I pretend to be
Jefferson's nanny.

1130
00:57:31,030 --> 00:57:34,199
But I was really hired
to watch her.

1131
00:57:34,239 --> 00:57:36,369
Yoo-hooo!

1132
00:57:36,409 --> 00:57:39,119
And this is what she's
like after Betty Ford.

1133
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:41,869
- Oh!
- Doesn't her husband care?

1134
00:57:41,909 --> 00:57:45,449
- Whoo!
- He's 75. She's an ex-showgirl.

1135
00:57:45,489 --> 00:57:48,869
He's not complaining
about anything.

1136
00:57:48,909 --> 00:57:50,409
Frosting fun!
Yay!

1137
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:55,780
I want to come here every day.

1138
00:57:57,489 --> 00:57:59,369
Hey.

1139
00:58:01,989 --> 00:58:03,489
What are you doing here?

1140
00:58:05,530 --> 00:58:07,619
And what is all over you?

1141
00:58:07,659 --> 00:58:11,449
Annie, will you tell me
what the hell is going on?

1142
00:58:11,489 --> 00:58:14,159
All right, listen up, people.
This is my apartment.

1143
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,989
And my roommate Lisa
is away

1144
00:58:17,030 --> 00:58:18,989
on... on business.

1145
00:58:19,030 --> 00:58:22,199
You are... oh,
just visiting.

1146
00:58:22,239 --> 00:58:24,530
- He is...
- Lynette's new boyfriend.

1147
00:58:24,570 --> 00:58:26,199
- Fine.
- I love your friends.

1148
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:27,989
What twisted game
are we playing here?

1149
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:30,320
We're playing the
my-mom-is-coming-over-

1150
00:58:30,369 --> 00:58:32,530
and-if-she-finds-out-I'm-a-nanny-
then-I'm-screwed game.

1151
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:35,239
I love it. Hey, should I whip up
a fondue for Mom?

1152
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,409
Um, well, you know what?
If you're gonna play it straight,

1153
00:58:37,449 --> 00:58:39,159
I would make it meatloaf.
I'm gonna borrow this.

1154
00:58:39,199 --> 00:58:41,320
That's my dress.
You can't borrow that dress.

1155
00:58:41,369 --> 00:58:43,199
It's a terrible dress.

1156
00:58:43,239 --> 00:58:45,409
Fondue?
Go get my dress.

1157
00:58:46,989 --> 00:58:50,239
Oh boy, Calvin.
Thank you so much. That looks delicious.

1158
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:54,320
It's so festively
presented too.

1159
00:58:56,030 --> 00:59:00,780
So, how did you
and Lynette meet?

1160
00:59:01,949 --> 00:59:05,739
Annie's roommate Lisa
introduced us.

1161
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:08,409
It's a shame
she's not here.

1162
00:59:08,449 --> 00:59:10,869
I used to
date her too.

1163
00:59:10,909 --> 00:59:13,449
Really?

1164
00:59:13,489 --> 00:59:16,369
So...

1165
00:59:16,409 --> 00:59:18,659
don't you just love
Annie's new place?

1166
00:59:18,699 --> 00:59:21,119
- Mm-hm.
- We do.

1167
00:59:21,159 --> 00:59:23,369
We're here all the time.

1168
00:59:23,369 --> 00:59:26,739
Yeah, I think it's very...
very interesting.

1169
00:59:26,780 --> 00:59:28,780
- It's a little small, but...
- Mmm.

1170
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:31,320
...it's a fine
steppingstone, honey.

1171
00:59:33,199 --> 00:59:35,989
It's work.
I'll take that.

1172
00:59:38,449 --> 00:59:41,820
Well, certainly
keeping her busy.

1173
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:43,119
- Very busy.
- Mm-hm.

1174
00:59:43,159 --> 00:59:44,820
- Busy bee.
- Relentlessly.

1175
00:59:44,869 --> 00:59:47,369
- Round the clock.
- Hello?

1176
00:59:47,369 --> 00:59:50,320
This isn't a brontosaurus.
You don't know anything.

1177
00:59:50,369 --> 00:59:53,659
Oh, Grayer!
Please!

1178
00:59:53,699 --> 00:59:56,699
It is yoga hour
and Mommy's on the phone.

1179
00:59:56,739 --> 00:59:57,820
Hello?

1180
00:59:57,909 --> 00:59:59,820
Yes, hi.
It's me.

1181
00:59:59,869 --> 01:00:02,070
l... I know that I agreed
to let you

1182
01:00:02,119 --> 01:00:04,320
visit your grandmother in
the hospital tonight,

1183
01:00:04,369 --> 01:00:07,659
but I feel I need to remind you
that tomorrow is Grayer's birthday.

1184
01:00:07,699 --> 01:00:10,659
What? How can that be?
His party isn't until next month.

1185
01:00:10,699 --> 01:00:12,530
Well, we scheduled it
that way on purpose

1186
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:15,070
because the party planner
I wanted wasn't available.

1187
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:17,739
Neither was my husband.
But as it turns out,

1188
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,199
Mr. X is coming home
for two days from Chicago,

1189
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:23,119
so we're planning a small
family celebration.

1190
01:00:23,159 --> 01:00:25,820
Oh that's lovely.
Grayer couldn't ask for a better gift.

1191
01:00:25,869 --> 01:00:28,619
And then afterwards,
we'll all head over to the Carlyle

1192
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:30,739
for a more formal
affair with friends.

1193
01:00:30,780 --> 01:00:33,070
Obviously, I do expect
you to attend.

1194
01:00:33,119 --> 01:00:34,659
Okay, all right.

1195
01:00:34,699 --> 01:00:36,280
So you will need to dress
appropriately.

1196
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,659
- Right.
- Anyway...

1197
01:00:37,699 --> 01:00:39,869
since you are not
around to help,

1198
01:00:39,909 --> 01:00:41,659
- I've taken care of everything.
- Mommy, play!

1199
01:00:41,699 --> 01:00:43,489
Thank you.

1200
01:00:43,530 --> 01:00:46,949
Also, some roses
arrived for you.

1201
01:00:46,989 --> 01:00:49,489
- Roses?
- Yes, very curious.

1202
01:00:49,530 --> 01:00:52,409
The card says,
"Accept my apology,

1203
01:00:52,449 --> 01:00:54,489
or else."

1204
01:00:54,530 --> 01:00:56,280
Oh, that's crazy Grandpa.

1205
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,369
He...

1206
01:00:58,409 --> 01:01:00,530
he didn't visit
Grandma last night

1207
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:02,119
and we just
let him have it.

1208
01:01:02,159 --> 01:01:04,570
Well, you know how Grayer
is around pollen.

1209
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:06,530
So, I'll have to
throw them out.

1210
01:01:06,570 --> 01:01:07,869
Annie?
- Oh, okay.

1211
01:01:07,909 --> 01:01:11,489
Well, you know,
I am going to...

1212
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:13,409
hang up because
the pacemaker isn't on.

1213
01:01:13,449 --> 01:01:15,119
So I'll see you
in the morning.

1214
01:01:15,159 --> 01:01:17,869
Oh gosh.

1215
01:01:17,909 --> 01:01:19,369
- Honey?
- Yeah?

1216
01:01:19,409 --> 01:01:21,409
- Are you okay?
- Mm-hm.

1217
01:01:21,409 --> 01:01:23,199
Perfect.

1218
01:01:23,239 --> 01:01:24,530
Dessert?

1219
01:01:38,869 --> 01:01:41,659
This is of vital importance,
are you aware of that?

1220
01:01:41,699 --> 01:01:43,159
I don't think right now
is the time.

1221
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:46,159
You have absolutely no idea
how disappointed I am.

1222
01:01:46,239 --> 01:01:48,320
Clowns are supposed to be funny.

1223
01:01:48,369 --> 01:01:52,199
Well, they're
French clowns, Grove.

1224
01:01:52,199 --> 01:01:55,199
I hate them and
I hate my birthday.

1225
01:01:55,239 --> 01:01:56,739
...in order to clean up your mess!

1226
01:01:56,780 --> 01:01:59,239
Do not interrupt me.

1227
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:02,869
Now you told me
that the extra year of preschool

1228
01:02:02,869 --> 01:02:04,909
would guarantee him
a spot.

1229
01:02:04,949 --> 01:02:07,619
Today he's six.
What's your plan now?

1230
01:02:09,869 --> 01:02:12,199
I'll be back, okay?

1231
01:02:12,199 --> 01:02:13,780
We should try to be calm.

1232
01:02:13,820 --> 01:02:15,739
My brother's kids got in.

1233
01:02:15,780 --> 01:02:18,739
...that isn't enough of a humiliation.
I will not tolerate

1234
01:02:18,780 --> 01:02:21,030
- at this point...
- There are mimes in the next room.

1235
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,030
- I suggest you keep your voice down.
- You know what?

1236
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:24,739
Hey.

1237
01:02:27,530 --> 01:02:29,489
What the hell
are you doing here?

1238
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:31,659
I want to know why
you threw my flowers away.

1239
01:02:31,699 --> 01:02:33,320
I found them
in the stairwell.

1240
01:02:33,369 --> 01:02:35,989
I didn't throw them away, okay?
My lunatic employer did.

1241
01:02:36,030 --> 01:02:38,739
And if you don't get out of here right
now, she's gonna throw me out too.

1242
01:02:38,780 --> 01:02:40,449
- Okay?
- Not until you agree to see me.

1243
01:02:40,489 --> 01:02:42,159
What?
This has got to stop.

1244
01:02:42,199 --> 01:02:43,820
Come on, one date.
That's all I'm asking here.

1245
01:02:43,869 --> 01:02:47,619
Oh, fine fine, okay?
After work on Thursday. Go go.

1246
01:02:55,739 --> 01:02:58,909
Nanny.

1247
01:02:58,949 --> 01:03:00,949
Before we head over
to the Carlyle,

1248
01:03:00,989 --> 01:03:03,909
I would like you to know
why Mr. X is so upset.

1249
01:03:05,320 --> 01:03:10,199
It seems that Grayer was
rejected for admission to Collegiate.

1250
01:03:10,199 --> 01:03:12,530
Um...
I'm very sorry.

1251
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:14,489
- That must be upsetting.
- Not upsetting.

1252
01:03:14,530 --> 01:03:16,530
Unacceptable.

1253
01:03:16,530 --> 01:03:18,530
Stop it!

1254
01:03:19,989 --> 01:03:21,739
Get away from me!
- Oh, sweetheart.

1255
01:03:21,780 --> 01:03:24,199
Don't be afraid.
They're only clowns.

1256
01:03:24,199 --> 01:03:26,030
- I hate them.
- They're nice French clowns.

1257
01:03:26,030 --> 01:03:28,949
They scare me!

1258
01:03:28,989 --> 01:03:31,570
Grayer, go to your mommy.

1259
01:03:31,619 --> 01:03:32,989
- Huh-uh.
- Go to your mommy, Grayer.

1260
01:03:33,030 --> 01:03:34,320
- Go.
- No.

1261
01:03:34,369 --> 01:03:36,320
Go on, sweetheart.

1262
01:03:36,369 --> 01:03:38,320
As I was saying, Nanny,

1263
01:03:38,369 --> 01:03:41,070
we feel that you are not
spending enough time

1264
01:03:41,119 --> 01:03:43,320
on educational activities
with our son.

1265
01:03:43,369 --> 01:03:46,239
Therefore we have decided
to hire a consultant

1266
01:03:46,280 --> 01:03:48,369
to fully research
the situation.

1267
01:03:48,409 --> 01:03:51,159
He will demand extra
time from you this week...

1268
01:03:51,199 --> 01:03:52,869
Whatever's best for Grayer.

1269
01:03:52,909 --> 01:03:56,199
...starting Thursday evening.

1270
01:03:56,239 --> 01:03:59,119
Do you read to the child
from "The Wall Street Journal"?

1271
01:03:59,199 --> 01:04:02,159
"Financial Times"?
"Granta"?

1272
01:04:05,369 --> 01:04:07,820
l... I sing to him
in French.

1273
01:04:07,869 --> 01:04:11,239
Well, we need more time
than I thought

1274
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:13,159
to get to
the bottom of this.

1275
01:04:21,199 --> 01:04:23,570
I know.
I know, I'm very very late.

1276
01:04:23,619 --> 01:04:25,369
I'm sorry.
Did you get my message?

1277
01:04:25,409 --> 01:04:27,989
- Yep. All six of 'em.
- I couldn't get out of work.

1278
01:04:28,030 --> 01:04:30,530
The consultant kept me forever.
It was horrible.

1279
01:04:30,530 --> 01:04:32,369
Yeah, well, not only
did I lose the reservation,

1280
01:04:32,409 --> 01:04:34,530
but the kitchen
is now closed. So...

1281
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:37,949
Okay.
I'm sorry I was late.

1282
01:04:37,989 --> 01:04:41,280
Um... sometimes
these things just...

1283
01:04:41,320 --> 01:04:42,820
don't work out, okay?

1284
01:04:42,869 --> 01:04:46,119
Wait, whoa whoa whoa
whoa whoa whoa whoa.

1285
01:04:46,159 --> 01:04:48,409
Think you can just get
rid of me that easily?

1286
01:04:48,449 --> 01:04:50,280
No, it's not about
getting rid of you.

1287
01:04:50,320 --> 01:04:53,780
It's just that no place around here
stays open this late. That's all.

1288
01:04:55,239 --> 01:04:58,070
Actually, I know
the perfect place.

1289
01:05:02,530 --> 01:05:05,070
Pretty good, huh?

1290
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:08,239
Number one slice
on the Upper East Side.

1291
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,869
It's not bad.

1292
01:05:10,909 --> 01:05:14,369
I'll tell you what though...
it doesn't touch the Jersey Shore.

1293
01:05:16,530 --> 01:05:18,659
Well, if you're such
a pizza connoisseur,

1294
01:05:18,699 --> 01:05:20,949
there's a really great
place in Italian Harlem.

1295
01:05:20,989 --> 01:05:22,280
I'll take you there
sometime.

1296
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,949
Harlem?

1297
01:05:23,989 --> 01:05:26,369
I have a hard time
imagining you in Harlem.

1298
01:05:26,369 --> 01:05:29,570
Why? I enjoy
exploring my city.

1299
01:05:29,619 --> 01:05:31,409
Something you should
probably do more of.

1300
01:05:31,449 --> 01:05:33,320
Oh, thank you.

1301
01:05:33,369 --> 01:05:36,619
I'll try to squeeze that in between
cleaning up Grayer's vomit

1302
01:05:36,659 --> 01:05:38,369
and picking up
Mrs. X's laundry.

1303
01:05:38,409 --> 01:05:41,119
Come on, if your job is that bad,
why don't you just quit?

1304
01:05:41,159 --> 01:05:43,449
I mean, it's not like you're on
a career path here.

1305
01:05:43,489 --> 01:05:44,699
I don't understand.

1306
01:05:44,739 --> 01:05:46,369
No, of course
you don't understand.

1307
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:49,030
You've obviously lived
a very charmed life

1308
01:05:49,070 --> 01:05:51,820
growing up on Fifth Avenue.
You went to Harvard.

1309
01:05:51,869 --> 01:05:53,780
A charmed life?

1310
01:05:55,909 --> 01:05:58,869
Okay. Now I get it.

1311
01:05:58,909 --> 01:06:02,320
You know, for your
information

1312
01:06:02,369 --> 01:06:04,199
my mother died
when I was four.

1313
01:06:04,199 --> 01:06:07,199
My father traveled
constantly for work.

1314
01:06:07,239 --> 01:06:09,530
I was raised by
nine different nannies

1315
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:12,030
until I was old enough
to get shipped off to boarding school.

1316
01:06:12,070 --> 01:06:14,489
That's how charmed
my life was.

1317
01:06:18,909 --> 01:06:21,159
- I'm really sorry.
- But you know something?

1318
01:06:21,199 --> 01:06:23,369
I still think I turned out
to be a pretty decent guy

1319
01:06:23,409 --> 01:06:24,739
in spite of it all.

1320
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:29,320
I guess I'm officially
an asshole.

1321
01:06:30,949 --> 01:06:33,070
Well...

1322
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:35,320
asshole is a pretty
strong word.

1323
01:06:35,369 --> 01:06:38,659
I would have gone
with jerk or bonehead.

1324
01:06:38,699 --> 01:06:41,869
But that's just
my prep school upbringing.

1325
01:06:44,030 --> 01:06:46,869
I don't know, you know,
I just... I would love to quit.

1326
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:50,199
I really would, but l...

1327
01:06:50,239 --> 01:06:52,699
I can't leave Grayer.

1328
01:06:52,699 --> 01:06:54,619
I can't.

1329
01:06:55,869 --> 01:06:57,369
You're gonna think
I'm totally crazy,

1330
01:06:57,409 --> 01:07:00,570
but I feel really bad
for her also.

1331
01:07:00,619 --> 01:07:02,869
Do you think I'm crazy?

1332
01:07:02,909 --> 01:07:05,699
Well, you know, you could
be suffering from

1333
01:07:05,739 --> 01:07:07,320
Stockholm Syndrome.

1334
01:07:07,369 --> 01:07:09,820
- You ever heard of Patty Hearst?
- Are you kidding?

1335
01:07:09,869 --> 01:07:11,489
Yes.

1336
01:07:11,570 --> 01:07:13,909
But I do think you should probably
let me kiss you right about now.

1337
01:07:13,949 --> 01:07:15,949
What?

1338
01:07:15,989 --> 01:07:18,369
Well...

1339
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:20,119
we're two blocks
from your building.

1340
01:07:20,159 --> 01:07:22,869
And once we get any closer,
I won't be able to go near you.

1341
01:07:22,869 --> 01:07:24,739
Which, to tell you
the truth,

1342
01:07:24,780 --> 01:07:26,739
is all I've really thought
about since that day

1343
01:07:26,739 --> 01:07:28,739
I saw you in that
Betsy Ross getup.

1344
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:31,320
That is really kinky and weird.

1345
01:07:31,369 --> 01:07:33,949
You don't know
the half of it.

1346
01:07:43,199 --> 01:07:45,449
Good night.

1347
01:07:45,489 --> 01:07:46,699
Good night.

1348
01:07:46,739 --> 01:07:49,199
- Pleasant evening.
- Yeah.

1349
01:08:01,159 --> 01:08:03,030
Good night.

1350
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:04,699
Uh-huh.

1351
01:08:18,869 --> 01:08:20,699
Look out for the...

1352
01:08:20,739 --> 01:08:21,819
Sorry.

1353
01:08:37,319 --> 01:08:38,989
While doing field work,

1354
01:08:39,029 --> 01:08:41,869
anthropologists have been
known to lose themselves

1355
01:08:41,869 --> 01:08:43,869
in the very society
that they're studying,

1356
01:08:43,909 --> 01:08:47,369
a phenomenon known
as "going native."

1357
01:08:47,409 --> 01:08:49,199
When this occurs,

1358
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:52,739
the proper course of action
is to remove oneself

1359
01:08:52,779 --> 01:08:54,569
ASAP.

1360
01:08:57,279 --> 01:08:59,489
After my night
with Harvard Hottie,

1361
01:08:59,529 --> 01:09:01,069
it became quite obvious

1362
01:09:01,119 --> 01:09:05,159
that my obsession with
the Xs meant I'd gone native.

1363
01:09:05,239 --> 01:09:07,279
Daydreaming in
the park that day,

1364
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:10,449
I came to the conclusion that
the only right thing to do

1365
01:09:10,489 --> 01:09:12,909
was confront Mrs. X...

1366
01:09:12,949 --> 01:09:14,619
and quit.

1367
01:09:16,869 --> 01:09:18,819
Oh, I forgot about this.

1368
01:09:18,909 --> 01:09:21,279
Wow.
This could work.

1369
01:09:25,029 --> 01:09:26,319
Mmm.

1370
01:09:26,369 --> 01:09:28,819
See if you can find me
something short.

1371
01:09:28,909 --> 01:09:30,989
It'll go better
with this neckline.

1372
01:09:31,069 --> 01:09:32,529
Okay.

1373
01:09:35,869 --> 01:09:37,949
Oh.

1374
01:09:37,989 --> 01:09:40,659
Did Grayer
get you this?

1375
01:09:42,199 --> 01:09:45,119
God.

1376
01:09:45,159 --> 01:09:48,529
I bought this for
my mother when I was 10.

1377
01:09:48,529 --> 01:09:52,909
She got mad at me, refused to wear it.
She said it was common.

1378
01:09:52,949 --> 01:09:56,449
I think I saved it
out of spite.

1379
01:10:10,619 --> 01:10:13,159
How about this?

1380
01:10:14,699 --> 01:10:18,239
Mr. X bought it for me for our first
wedding anniversary.

1381
01:10:18,279 --> 01:10:20,869
So it's only fitting
that I should wear it tonight,

1382
01:10:20,909 --> 01:10:21,989
right?

1383
01:10:22,069 --> 01:10:24,239
Definitely.

1384
01:10:34,699 --> 01:10:37,659
Mrs. X, I need to
talk to you about something.

1385
01:10:39,029 --> 01:10:40,949
I know you're really
busy tonight,

1386
01:10:40,989 --> 01:10:43,069
so I was wondering if we
could schedule some time

1387
01:10:43,119 --> 01:10:45,819
- tomorrow night to talk.
- What is it, Nanny?

1388
01:10:48,069 --> 01:10:50,739
l... I think it's better
if we talk alone.

1389
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:53,029
What is it?

1390
01:10:54,699 --> 01:10:56,949
Nanny, lend a hand.

1391
01:11:14,319 --> 01:11:16,819
Well?

1392
01:11:16,869 --> 01:11:18,819
You look amazing.

1393
01:11:20,529 --> 01:11:22,819
- Really?
- You look very pretty, Mommy.

1394
01:11:22,869 --> 01:11:25,449
And... and you like
the Dior?

1395
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:28,449
I mean, I know
it's a little much for dinner,

1396
01:11:28,529 --> 01:11:29,869
but afterwards
he's taking me

1397
01:11:29,909 --> 01:11:32,449
to the President's
Circle Gala at the Met.

1398
01:11:32,489 --> 01:11:34,159
Well, I couldn't imagine
a more perfect dress

1399
01:11:34,199 --> 01:11:35,819
for a romantic
anniversary.

1400
01:11:35,869 --> 01:11:38,239
All I need now
is my husband.

1401
01:11:39,619 --> 01:11:42,279
I just called
the airport.

1402
01:11:42,319 --> 01:11:45,529
There wasn't a single
delay or cancelation out of Chicago

1403
01:11:45,529 --> 01:11:47,659
so...

1404
01:11:47,699 --> 01:11:49,949
Where can
that man be?

1405
01:11:51,569 --> 01:11:53,909
Nanny,
call La Grande Nuit

1406
01:11:53,949 --> 01:11:55,529
- and tell them we're running late.
- Come on.

1407
01:11:55,569 --> 01:11:57,159
I don't want to
lose the reservation.

1408
01:11:57,199 --> 01:11:59,779
Is it "Le Grande Nuit"
or "La Grande..."

1409
01:11:59,819 --> 01:12:01,909
"Le... Les"?

1410
01:12:01,949 --> 01:12:03,409
I think it's "La."

1411
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:07,159
Thanks, smarty-pants.

1412
01:12:09,909 --> 01:12:12,449
- Hello?
Uh yeah, it's me.

1413
01:12:12,489 --> 01:12:14,369
Listen, I'm losing
cell service here.

1414
01:12:14,409 --> 01:12:16,619
I need you to find
my wife and explain to her

1415
01:12:16,659 --> 01:12:18,489
that my flight
was canceled.

1416
01:12:18,529 --> 01:12:21,489
Uh, and since I'm gonna have to be back
here Sunday night,

1417
01:12:21,569 --> 01:12:23,409
I'm just gonna spend
the whole weekend in Chicago.

1418
01:12:23,449 --> 01:12:25,949
- No no no...
- Make sure to tell her I'm sorry.

1419
01:12:25,989 --> 01:12:27,949
No no no, Mr. X, you can't do this.
Look, she...

1420
01:12:33,819 --> 01:12:36,619
Nanny, who was it?

1421
01:12:43,409 --> 01:12:45,069
What did he say?

1422
01:12:46,659 --> 01:12:48,569
Um...

1423
01:12:50,239 --> 01:12:52,779
he said that...

1424
01:12:52,819 --> 01:12:54,319
his flight was canceled.

1425
01:12:56,369 --> 01:12:59,489
And...

1426
01:12:59,529 --> 01:13:02,739
and he's very
very sorry.

1427
01:13:09,239 --> 01:13:11,699
Make sure you
put that one on top.

1428
01:13:11,699 --> 01:13:12,819
I don't want
anything to wrinkle.

1429
01:13:15,319 --> 01:13:16,699
Mommy,
where are you going?

1430
01:13:19,529 --> 01:13:21,069
Mommy, don't go!

1431
01:13:21,119 --> 01:13:24,449
No, Gray... no, Grayer.
Don't... don't be difficult.

1432
01:13:24,489 --> 01:13:27,199
Mommy has to go away for
a few days to get some rest.

1433
01:13:27,239 --> 01:13:30,369
Nanny, I've decided to
take a few days off.

1434
01:13:30,409 --> 01:13:33,369
I'll be at the spa
at Canyon Ranch in Lenox.

1435
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:36,569
- Maria has all my numbers.
- Oh God.

1436
01:13:38,409 --> 01:13:41,909
Nanny, can we go upstairs?

1437
01:13:41,949 --> 01:13:44,989
I feel funny.

1438
01:13:45,029 --> 01:13:48,569
Oh my God!
How did this come on so fast? 104?

1439
01:13:51,699 --> 01:13:53,699
Oh my God, oh my God.
Okay okay.

1440
01:13:53,739 --> 01:13:55,699
Honey, come here.
You okay?

1441
01:13:55,739 --> 01:13:57,029
I'm so sorry.

1442
01:13:57,069 --> 01:13:59,659
That's okay, that's okay.
All right.

1443
01:14:01,369 --> 01:14:03,319
Okay, wait.
No.

1444
01:14:03,369 --> 01:14:05,449
Hey, Lynette, it's Annie.
Listen, I need your help.

1445
01:14:05,489 --> 01:14:07,369
Grayer has
a temperature of 104

1446
01:14:07,409 --> 01:14:09,739
and I have vomit all over me
and there's nobody here.

1447
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:11,239
God. Did you
call his mother?

1448
01:14:11,279 --> 01:14:13,529
Yes, I called his mother.
She's at some friggin' spa.

1449
01:14:13,569 --> 01:14:15,619
I left three messages
and she won't call me back.

1450
01:14:15,659 --> 01:14:17,489
I don't know what to do.

1451
01:14:17,529 --> 01:14:19,489
I mean, should I take him to
the emergency room or something?

1452
01:14:19,529 --> 01:14:21,569
- Annie, I can't answer that.
- I...

1453
01:14:21,619 --> 01:14:24,319
Do you know a number of a doctor

1454
01:14:24,369 --> 01:14:26,819
I could call for advice,
or a nurse even?

1455
01:14:26,869 --> 01:14:28,159
Of course I know a nurse.

1456
01:14:28,199 --> 01:14:30,069
Your mother.

1457
01:14:32,199 --> 01:14:33,989
Nanny?

1458
01:14:34,029 --> 01:14:36,119
Lynette, I have to
call you back.

1459
01:14:36,159 --> 01:14:38,489
What is it, sweetheart?
What's wrong?

1460
01:14:42,119 --> 01:14:45,069
I want my mommy.

1461
01:14:47,409 --> 01:14:49,369
Me too.

1462
01:14:53,069 --> 01:14:55,069
How is everything?

1463
01:14:55,119 --> 01:14:57,529
His fever's down.

1464
01:14:57,529 --> 01:14:59,819
But I think he's
got the croup.

1465
01:14:59,869 --> 01:15:02,529
The steam should help
open his passages

1466
01:15:02,569 --> 01:15:06,489
and hopefully it'll ease up his cough
and he can get some rest.

1467
01:15:06,529 --> 01:15:08,699
Is... is there anything
I can do?

1468
01:15:08,699 --> 01:15:11,409
Just close the door.

1469
01:15:22,199 --> 01:15:23,659
He's okay now.

1470
01:15:23,699 --> 01:15:25,319
Much better.

1471
01:15:25,369 --> 01:15:26,819
Oh, thank you, God.

1472
01:15:26,869 --> 01:15:29,319
Even so, you should bring him
to the doctor in the morning.

1473
01:15:29,369 --> 01:15:31,569
He's probably gonna
need a prescription.

1474
01:15:31,619 --> 01:15:32,869
Okay.

1475
01:15:32,909 --> 01:15:35,199
Hey, Ma, um...

1476
01:15:36,779 --> 01:15:39,239
l... I don't know
how to...

1477
01:15:39,279 --> 01:15:41,699
thank you for
coming here, and helping...

1478
01:15:41,739 --> 01:15:43,659
Why'd you lie
to me, Annie?

1479
01:15:47,369 --> 01:15:49,699
I have never lied to you.

1480
01:15:49,739 --> 01:15:51,279
Ever.

1481
01:15:51,319 --> 01:15:52,569
I know.

1482
01:15:52,619 --> 01:15:55,869
I just...

1483
01:15:57,819 --> 01:16:00,489
Oh, Mom, I couldn't
handle it anymore.

1484
01:16:00,529 --> 01:16:01,949
- I just couldn't handle it.
- What?

1485
01:16:01,989 --> 01:16:04,489
What couldn't you handle?
You're young, you're smart,

1486
01:16:04,529 --> 01:16:08,199
you're energetic. You got this
incredibly bright future ahead of you.

1487
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:09,699
It was too bright, Ma.
All right?

1488
01:16:09,699 --> 01:16:12,119
I just... I just, I got...
I had to get away.

1489
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:14,119
And do this?

1490
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:16,529
You understand?
Every night shift I worked,

1491
01:16:16,569 --> 01:16:19,159
every overtime hour
I accepted,

1492
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:22,159
I did it because I wanted
something better for you than I had.

1493
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:25,949
Nanny!
Good, you're up.

1494
01:16:25,989 --> 01:16:27,489
Just leave that there.

1495
01:16:27,529 --> 01:16:30,779
So listen, the spa
was just awful,

1496
01:16:30,819 --> 01:16:34,239
totally overrun
with suburban riffraff.

1497
01:16:34,279 --> 01:16:36,279
And then in the middle
of my body scrub,

1498
01:16:36,319 --> 01:16:38,909
Mr. X called
and believe it or not,

1499
01:16:38,949 --> 01:16:41,699
he wants to take us
all to Nantucket next week.

1500
01:16:41,739 --> 01:16:44,819
So I figured I might as well
cut my trip short and...

1501
01:16:46,869 --> 01:16:49,069
Who's this?

1502
01:16:49,119 --> 01:16:50,819
I'm Judy.

1503
01:16:50,869 --> 01:16:53,319
It's my mom.

1504
01:16:54,489 --> 01:16:57,489
You never mentioned
you had a mother, Nanny.

1505
01:16:57,529 --> 01:17:00,279
Um...

1506
01:17:00,319 --> 01:17:02,989
my mom's a nurse.
She came over here to help me.

1507
01:17:03,029 --> 01:17:06,199
Grayer's been very
very very sick.

1508
01:17:06,239 --> 01:17:08,489
- I tried calling you...
- Where is he?

1509
01:17:08,529 --> 01:17:11,989
Well he's...
he's sleeping now.

1510
01:17:12,029 --> 01:17:14,069
Then he can't be
that sick now, can he?

1511
01:17:14,119 --> 01:17:16,449
So listen, could you
quickly unpack my luggage

1512
01:17:16,489 --> 01:17:18,449
and just put everything
in the laundry?

1513
01:17:18,489 --> 01:17:21,489
I'm exhausted and Mr. X is expected
sometime before 9:00.

1514
01:17:21,529 --> 01:17:23,909
I will see you
in the morning.

1515
01:17:23,949 --> 01:17:27,159
Oh, very nice
to meet you, Julie.

1516
01:17:27,199 --> 01:17:28,909
Judy.

1517
01:17:40,739 --> 01:17:44,619
Call me when this phase
of your life is over.

1518
01:17:48,279 --> 01:17:51,819
I desperately wanted
to yell out after her,

1519
01:17:51,869 --> 01:17:53,819
but it was like one of
those awful dreams

1520
01:17:53,869 --> 01:17:55,949
where I had no voice.

1521
01:17:55,989 --> 01:17:58,949
My desire to be an observer of life...

1522
01:17:58,989 --> 01:18:01,869
...was actually keeping me
from living one.

1523
01:18:01,869 --> 01:18:05,319
Clearly, the woman's
heinous.

1524
01:18:05,369 --> 01:18:07,529
You gotta quit.
It's just that simple.

1525
01:18:07,569 --> 01:18:10,449
I can't, all right?
I tried.

1526
01:18:10,489 --> 01:18:13,819
What if I made you
a tempting offer?

1527
01:18:13,869 --> 01:18:16,819
I'm gonna go to my father's house in
Southampton for a month.

1528
01:18:16,869 --> 01:18:21,319
I've got to take some time, figure out
if law school is really right for me.

1529
01:18:21,369 --> 01:18:22,739
Why don't you join me?

1530
01:18:22,779 --> 01:18:24,869
Do a little soul-searching.

1531
01:18:24,909 --> 01:18:27,239
We'd get the whole house to ourselves...
won't cost us a cent.

1532
01:18:27,279 --> 01:18:30,489
We'll walk on the beach.
We'll drink red wine,

1533
01:18:30,529 --> 01:18:32,949
grill fresh fish.

1534
01:18:32,989 --> 01:18:36,449
That sounds like heaven.

1535
01:18:36,489 --> 01:18:38,909
But what if this vacation
can save their marriage?

1536
01:18:38,949 --> 01:18:41,119
If I quit now,
I'll ruin it

1537
01:18:41,159 --> 01:18:42,989
and break Grayer's heart.

1538
01:18:43,029 --> 01:18:46,369
What about my heart?
Do I count for anything?

1539
01:18:48,489 --> 01:18:51,369
Come on, say yes.

1540
01:18:51,409 --> 01:18:53,869
Be young with me
in the Hamptons.

1541
01:18:53,869 --> 01:18:56,409
Don't go to Nantucket
with the weirdoes.

1542
01:18:56,449 --> 01:18:58,569
What do you say?

1543
01:19:07,369 --> 01:19:10,319
Not a chance in hell,
is there?

1544
01:19:10,369 --> 01:19:13,279
- I can take a hint.
- Come on, I didn't say no.

1545
01:19:13,319 --> 01:19:16,449
You weren't exactly screaming
yes though, were you?

1546
01:19:16,489 --> 01:19:18,489
I'm starting to wonder
if you're really selfless

1547
01:19:18,529 --> 01:19:21,199
or just a little
self-obsessed.

1548
01:19:21,239 --> 01:19:23,159
Thank you.
Thanks.

1549
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:25,619
I have to go.

1550
01:19:28,069 --> 01:19:32,449
Listen, if you change
your mind, my offer stands.

1551
01:19:39,739 --> 01:19:42,159
We're going to 'Tucket.
We're going to 'Tucket.

1552
01:19:42,199 --> 01:19:45,449
Guess what else?
I'm getting a puppy.

1553
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:47,619
Oh!

1554
01:19:47,659 --> 01:19:49,819
Oh my God!

1555
01:19:52,119 --> 01:19:54,869
Daddy, Daddy,
where's my puppy?

1556
01:19:54,909 --> 01:19:58,279
Been waiting for you right up
in the car there, sport.

1557
01:19:58,319 --> 01:20:00,069
- Isn't it wonderful?
- Mmm.

1558
01:20:00,119 --> 01:20:02,199
A family trip has been
long overdue.

1559
01:20:02,239 --> 01:20:04,989
Mmm, listen, I didn't
want to say anything in front of Grayer,

1560
01:20:05,029 --> 01:20:06,989
but the truth is,
I can only stay for a few days.

1561
01:20:07,029 --> 01:20:09,699
They're really pushing me to
finish up in Chicago.

1562
01:20:09,739 --> 01:20:12,279
You can't be serious.

1563
01:20:12,319 --> 01:20:14,279
You're not gonna leave us
on this island alone.

1564
01:20:14,319 --> 01:20:16,369
Okay, we'll talk
about it later.

1565
01:20:16,409 --> 01:20:19,069
# But I'm moving on #

1566
01:20:19,119 --> 01:20:24,029
# I'm gonna be your
number one #

1567
01:20:24,069 --> 01:20:26,739
# I'm not the kind
of girl #

1568
01:20:26,779 --> 01:20:31,199
# Who gives up
just like that #

1569
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:33,239
- # Oh no-o-o-o... #
Hi.

1570
01:20:33,279 --> 01:20:36,279
It's Annie.
I haven't heard from you in a while.

1571
01:20:36,319 --> 01:20:38,819
You're probably
in Southampton,

1572
01:20:38,869 --> 01:20:40,819
but I just wanted to
let you know that...

1573
01:20:40,869 --> 01:20:42,699
my cell phone
doesn't work here.

1574
01:20:42,739 --> 01:20:45,529
So if you wanted
to call...

1575
01:20:45,529 --> 01:20:47,909
if you wanted
to call,

1576
01:20:47,949 --> 01:20:50,069
- you probably have the number...
Nanny, hurry up!

1577
01:20:50,119 --> 01:20:52,069
...already on your cell phone,
but I will give it to you

1578
01:20:52,119 --> 01:20:54,949
just in case.
It is 508...

1579
01:20:54,989 --> 01:20:57,199
Hello?
- Oh.

1580
01:20:57,239 --> 01:20:59,369
- What, hello?
- Hello, Nanny?

1581
01:20:59,409 --> 01:21:01,119
- Wha...
- I need to use this phone.

1582
01:21:01,159 --> 01:21:03,569
- Immediately.
- Okay, so sorry.

1583
01:21:03,569 --> 01:21:07,199
- Oh God.
- Nanny, we're going to the beach.

1584
01:21:07,239 --> 01:21:09,619
When I grow up,
I want enough money

1585
01:21:09,659 --> 01:21:12,029
to build a real castle.

1586
01:21:12,069 --> 01:21:15,239
Just remember, Grove,
that money can't buy love.

1587
01:21:15,279 --> 01:21:18,279
But Mommy pays you money
and I love you.

1588
01:21:18,319 --> 01:21:20,989
Surprise surprise, dear.

1589
01:21:22,779 --> 01:21:26,659
- Mother?
- My, you've gotten portly.

1590
01:21:26,699 --> 01:21:29,159
Hi, Grandma.

1591
01:21:29,199 --> 01:21:31,369
What the hell
are you doing here?

1592
01:21:31,369 --> 01:21:35,119
Ask your wife.
She's the one who requested I come.

1593
01:21:35,159 --> 01:21:38,779
- Darling, l...
- Not that I need an invitation.

1594
01:21:38,819 --> 01:21:40,949
It is my house.

1595
01:21:40,989 --> 01:21:43,449
I just wanted your mother
to be here for the news.

1596
01:21:43,489 --> 01:21:46,119
News, what news?
What in the hell is going on here?

1597
01:21:46,159 --> 01:21:49,569
I'm having another baby.

1598
01:21:52,029 --> 01:21:54,279
...virtually impossible.

1599
01:21:54,319 --> 01:21:56,029
What exactly do you want?

1600
01:21:56,069 --> 01:21:58,869
And now my mother is here
so I can't go to Chicago.

1601
01:21:58,909 --> 01:22:01,159
One lousy week!

1602
01:22:01,199 --> 01:22:04,159
You know something?
You are an infuriating woman.

1603
01:22:04,199 --> 01:22:05,659
You really are!

1604
01:22:05,699 --> 01:22:08,489
That's what you get for
rejecting debutante season.

1605
01:22:08,529 --> 01:22:10,489
Who asked you, bitch?

1606
01:22:20,819 --> 01:22:22,529
Can you look after
the kids for a minute?

1607
01:22:22,569 --> 01:22:25,619
I'm the only nanny here.
I just have to use the restroom.

1608
01:22:25,659 --> 01:22:27,409
Hmm.

1609
01:22:27,449 --> 01:22:30,619
Make it snappy, dear.
I'm on the last chapter.

1610
01:22:30,659 --> 01:22:32,699
Oh, thanks a million.

1611
01:22:46,239 --> 01:22:49,199
Oh.
You look gorgeous.

1612
01:22:50,699 --> 01:22:53,489
Listen, I need some nanny advice.

1613
01:22:53,529 --> 01:22:55,199
- Okay.
- To tell you the truth,

1614
01:22:55,239 --> 01:22:58,409
I don't know what's gotten
into her lately.

1615
01:22:58,449 --> 01:23:01,409
Well, I installed
a Nanny Cam.

1616
01:23:01,449 --> 01:23:03,489
So we'll soon see
the truth.

1617
01:23:03,569 --> 01:23:06,369
It might be time
to let her go.

1618
01:23:09,909 --> 01:23:12,369
I saw another one.

1619
01:23:12,409 --> 01:23:14,409
Make a wish, Grove.

1620
01:23:14,449 --> 01:23:18,369
I wish we could stay
in 'Tucket forever,

1621
01:23:18,409 --> 01:23:21,779
Mommy, Daddy, you
and my puppy.

1622
01:23:28,739 --> 01:23:30,739
Grove?

1623
01:23:35,489 --> 01:23:38,619
You know I...

1624
01:23:38,659 --> 01:23:41,869
I'm not gonna be
your nanny forever.

1625
01:23:41,909 --> 01:23:45,029
I can't be.

1626
01:23:45,029 --> 01:23:48,489
That doesn't mean I'm not
gonna always be your friend.

1627
01:24:12,409 --> 01:24:15,319
What, there's no OJ
in the goddamned shit-shack?

1628
01:24:15,369 --> 01:24:18,239
Oh, I was just
about to make some.

1629
01:24:18,279 --> 01:24:19,989
Mm-hm.

1630
01:24:29,199 --> 01:24:32,069
Where's Grayer?
Isn't he up yet?

1631
01:24:32,119 --> 01:24:35,319
Um, he had a little
trouble sleeping.

1632
01:24:35,369 --> 01:24:37,199
So...

1633
01:24:41,199 --> 01:24:44,529
Concentrate? You have
got to be kidding me.

1634
01:24:44,569 --> 01:24:47,779
All my money and I can't
get fresh-squeezed? Come on.

1635
01:24:49,569 --> 01:24:52,869
Uh, we used it all
at the party, so...

1636
01:24:52,909 --> 01:24:54,659
Hmm.

1637
01:24:54,699 --> 01:24:58,159
Well then, why don't you and I
take a little trip to the market

1638
01:24:58,199 --> 01:25:00,029
and get us some, huh?

1639
01:25:23,029 --> 01:25:26,069
I'm not in right now.
Leave it at the beep.

1640
01:25:26,119 --> 01:25:29,659
# Be the new one,
burn to shine #

1641
01:25:29,699 --> 01:25:34,119
# I take the blue ones
every time #

1642
01:25:34,159 --> 01:25:38,279
# Walk me down
your broken line #

1643
01:25:38,319 --> 01:25:40,949
# All you have to do
is cry #

1644
01:25:40,989 --> 01:25:43,989
# Yes, all you
have to do is cry #

1645
01:25:45,569 --> 01:25:48,449
# All you have to do
is cry. #

1646
01:26:01,199 --> 01:26:03,529
- Where's Grayer?
- With his grandmother.

1647
01:26:05,369 --> 01:26:07,989
And where, may I ask,
have you been?

1648
01:26:11,409 --> 01:26:13,369
Um...

1649
01:26:13,369 --> 01:26:15,909
- I just had to clear my head.
- Did you?

1650
01:26:15,949 --> 01:26:19,069
I imagine your
unacceptable behavior

1651
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:22,659
has something to do
with that boy in the building.

1652
01:26:22,699 --> 01:26:25,489
Nanny.

1653
01:26:25,529 --> 01:26:28,529
I wasn't
born yesterday.

1654
01:26:28,569 --> 01:26:30,909
He called several
times this week.

1655
01:26:30,949 --> 01:26:33,449
He called?
Why didn't you tell me?

1656
01:26:33,489 --> 01:26:35,449
I suppose I forgot.

1657
01:26:38,529 --> 01:26:41,029
It's really for
your own good.

1658
01:26:41,069 --> 01:26:43,659
He's a little out of
your league, don't you think?

1659
01:26:43,699 --> 01:26:46,319
It couldn't possibly
end well.

1660
01:26:47,819 --> 01:26:50,779
Clearly this
isn't working out.

1661
01:26:50,819 --> 01:26:53,159
Mr. X has arranged for
a taxi to take you to the ferry

1662
01:26:53,199 --> 01:26:55,119
and then for a car to
pick you up on the other end.

1663
01:26:55,159 --> 01:26:57,159
Please don't...
please don't do this.

1664
01:26:57,199 --> 01:27:00,239
Not... not for me,
but for Grayer.

1665
01:27:00,279 --> 01:27:03,569
Not until you and your husband work
your problems out.

1666
01:27:03,619 --> 01:27:05,949
Don't you dare.

1667
01:27:05,989 --> 01:27:08,739
You stupid...
you stupid girl.

1668
01:27:08,779 --> 01:27:11,739
As if you know anything
about my life.

1669
01:27:11,779 --> 01:27:14,529
As if you know anything
about the real world.

1670
01:27:36,239 --> 01:27:37,529
All I got's $100.

1671
01:27:37,569 --> 01:27:40,069
All right, you know what?
Just give me the change

1672
01:27:40,119 --> 01:27:42,319
when you come back for my mother
at some point, okay?

1673
01:27:42,369 --> 01:27:44,029
Keep 10 bucks
for yourself, all right?

1674
01:27:44,069 --> 01:27:46,739
Nanny...

1675
01:27:46,779 --> 01:27:48,989
here's your final payment.

1676
01:27:49,029 --> 01:27:50,869
I expect you to
have all your things

1677
01:27:50,869 --> 01:27:52,869
out of our apartment by
the time we come back.

1678
01:27:52,869 --> 01:27:55,369
Just leave the keys
with the doorman.

1679
01:28:03,029 --> 01:28:05,779
Grayer, I think you
should take a nap.

1680
01:28:05,819 --> 01:28:08,319
I'm certainly ready
for one.

1681
01:28:08,409 --> 01:28:11,489
Nanny!
Where are you going?

1682
01:28:13,159 --> 01:28:15,819
- Nanny!
- Grayer. Grayer.

1683
01:28:15,869 --> 01:28:17,279
- Nanny!
- Stay here.

1684
01:28:17,319 --> 01:28:19,199
- Here.
- What are you doing?

1685
01:28:19,239 --> 01:28:20,869
- Take it, take it.
- What?

1686
01:28:20,869 --> 01:28:23,699
I can't tolerate the yapping.
Grayer's too young anyway.

1687
01:28:24,869 --> 01:28:26,619
- Nanny!
- Grayer.

1688
01:28:26,659 --> 01:28:28,739
- Nanny, don't go!
- Grayer, sweetheart...

1689
01:28:28,779 --> 01:28:32,199
Nanny, wait!

1690
01:28:32,239 --> 01:28:34,699
- Nanny!
- Grayer!

1691
01:28:34,739 --> 01:28:36,819
Nanny, don't leave me.

1692
01:28:39,279 --> 01:28:41,489
Nanny!

1693
01:28:48,199 --> 01:28:50,409
Grayer.

1694
01:29:38,239 --> 01:29:39,739
What?

1695
01:29:58,569 --> 01:30:00,409
Go ahead, puppy,
do your business.

1696
01:30:00,449 --> 01:30:02,279
Anywhere you like.

1697
01:30:08,319 --> 01:30:09,989
Good puppy!

1698
01:30:12,199 --> 01:30:15,869
Nanny Cam, Nanny Cam,
where are you hiding?

1699
01:30:22,739 --> 01:30:24,909
I love you.

1700
01:30:27,739 --> 01:30:30,029
Hola.

1701
01:30:31,279 --> 01:30:32,949
Hmm.

1702
01:30:33,949 --> 01:30:35,869
Aha!

1703
01:30:35,909 --> 01:30:38,569
Okay, lady,
you want Nanny Cam?

1704
01:30:38,619 --> 01:30:40,699
I'll give you
"Nannies Gone Wild."

1705
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:47,069
And this is how the most
significant confrontation

1706
01:30:47,119 --> 01:30:49,489
in my life...

1707
01:30:49,529 --> 01:30:52,159
happened with a teddy bear.

1708
01:30:59,819 --> 01:31:04,029
After the abrupt termination
of my field work,

1709
01:31:04,029 --> 01:31:06,489
I took some time to
make sense

1710
01:31:06,529 --> 01:31:09,699
of all that
I had witnessed.

1711
01:31:09,739 --> 01:31:11,449
During this period

1712
01:31:11,489 --> 01:31:14,159
I read that critics of
anthropology believe

1713
01:31:14,199 --> 01:31:16,409
that just by
observing a culture

1714
01:31:16,449 --> 01:31:18,569
you inevitably change it.

1715
01:31:18,619 --> 01:31:20,739
- Mm!
- Ow! Hey.

1716
01:31:20,779 --> 01:31:23,569
In the many times that
I thought of Grayer,

1717
01:31:23,619 --> 01:31:26,819
I secretly hoped
those critics...

1718
01:31:26,869 --> 01:31:28,989
were right.

1719
01:31:30,619 --> 01:31:34,029
This is a tape of
my latest nanny disaster.

1720
01:31:34,119 --> 01:31:37,779
She was extremely problematic,
to say the least.

1721
01:31:37,819 --> 01:31:39,619
She neglected Grayer.

1722
01:31:39,659 --> 01:31:42,819
She drank.
She even flirted with my husband.

1723
01:31:42,869 --> 01:31:44,279
I finally had to fire her

1724
01:31:44,319 --> 01:31:46,989
for promiscuous behavior
with a boy in the building.

1725
01:31:47,029 --> 01:31:50,029
This videotape shows her
feeding my child

1726
01:31:50,029 --> 01:31:53,779
peanut butter and jelly
directly from the jar.

1727
01:31:53,819 --> 01:31:55,619
You know, I remember
this nanny.

1728
01:31:55,659 --> 01:31:58,369
She had a very
peculiar attitude.

1729
01:31:58,409 --> 01:32:00,369
Let's watch.

1730
01:32:00,369 --> 01:32:02,699
You excited about
going to Nantucket?

1731
01:32:02,699 --> 01:32:03,869
Yes.

1732
01:32:03,909 --> 01:32:05,409
Okay, well, why don't you
close your eyes

1733
01:32:05,449 --> 01:32:07,779
and you can dream about
building sand castles?

1734
01:32:07,819 --> 01:32:09,489
- I love you, Nanny.
- Good night.

1735
01:32:09,529 --> 01:32:12,029
This must be the wrong tape.
I've never seen this one before.

1736
01:32:12,069 --> 01:32:14,659
It's all right, just let it play out.
We'll get to something good.

1737
01:32:18,619 --> 01:32:20,819
Oh!
It's a problem.

1738
01:32:20,869 --> 01:32:23,029
Big problem.

1739
01:32:23,069 --> 01:32:26,699
Okay, Mrs. X, now it's time for a few
simple child-care rules.

1740
01:32:26,699 --> 01:32:29,409
Oh, all right. The teddy bear has
been compromised.

1741
01:32:29,449 --> 01:32:32,989
Slamming the door in
your kid's face is not okay.

1742
01:32:33,069 --> 01:32:36,319
Spending more time on a benefit for
kids you've never met

1743
01:32:36,369 --> 01:32:38,819
than you do with
your own blood is not okay.

1744
01:32:38,869 --> 01:32:42,699
Going to a spa when
your son has a fever of 104

1745
01:32:42,699 --> 01:32:44,739
and not answering
emergency calls,

1746
01:32:44,779 --> 01:32:46,569
that officially makes you
an unfit mother.

1747
01:32:46,619 --> 01:32:48,029
This is outrageous.
Stop the tape.

1748
01:32:48,029 --> 01:32:51,909
Uh, no, this is clearly
a disgruntled nanny.

1749
01:32:51,949 --> 01:32:54,739
We... we might have
something to learn here.

1750
01:32:54,779 --> 01:32:58,569
Yeah, I know that you're really busy
with your hair appointments

1751
01:32:58,619 --> 01:33:00,239
and your Watsu
massages

1752
01:33:00,279 --> 01:33:03,279
and your attempts to stay young
so your husband won't leave you,

1753
01:33:03,319 --> 01:33:07,159
but here's an idea... why don't you try
eating dinner with your child

1754
01:33:07,199 --> 01:33:08,779
every once in a blue moon?

1755
01:33:08,819 --> 01:33:10,239
And a head's up here,
lady.

1756
01:33:10,279 --> 01:33:13,119
Try smiling once in a while.
People hate you!

1757
01:33:14,869 --> 01:33:16,659
As for you, Mr. X,

1758
01:33:16,699 --> 01:33:18,869
who the hell are you?

1759
01:33:18,909 --> 01:33:21,069
Maybe you're asking
the same about me.

1760
01:33:21,119 --> 01:33:22,949
I know you've noticed my ass,

1761
01:33:22,989 --> 01:33:24,869
but you probably don't
recognize my face,

1762
01:33:24,869 --> 01:33:26,659
so here's a little hint,
okay?

1763
01:33:26,699 --> 01:33:29,659
I'm the one who's been
raising your son.

1764
01:33:34,409 --> 01:33:36,699
Grayer is not
an accessory.

1765
01:33:36,739 --> 01:33:40,409
His mother didn't
order him from a catalogue.

1766
01:33:40,449 --> 01:33:42,659
Your son, your wife,

1767
01:33:42,699 --> 01:33:45,529
are... are...

1768
01:33:45,569 --> 01:33:47,869
are people in your home,

1769
01:33:47,909 --> 01:33:51,819
human beings who are
drowning in their desire

1770
01:33:51,869 --> 01:33:54,949
for you to just...
for you to look at them.

1771
01:34:08,779 --> 01:34:12,699
You know, the truth is,
I don't wish either of you harm.

1772
01:34:14,529 --> 01:34:17,369
If for no other reason
than you having

1773
01:34:17,409 --> 01:34:20,779
the profound privilege
of being Grayer's parents.

1774
01:34:23,779 --> 01:34:26,449
Grayer loves you.

1775
01:34:28,489 --> 01:34:30,369
He...

1776
01:34:30,409 --> 01:34:34,119
he doesn't care what you're
wearing or what you buy him

1777
01:34:34,159 --> 01:34:35,869
or what school
he gets into.

1778
01:34:35,909 --> 01:34:39,779
He just... he just
wants you there.

1779
01:34:39,819 --> 01:34:42,159
That's it.

1780
01:34:43,739 --> 01:34:46,409
And time's running out,

1781
01:34:46,449 --> 01:34:48,909
and he won't love you
unconditionally that much longer.

1782
01:34:48,949 --> 01:34:52,069
So...

1783
01:34:52,119 --> 01:34:54,819
for your own good,

1784
01:34:54,869 --> 01:34:57,239
don't miss out
on getting to know him.

1785
01:34:57,279 --> 01:35:00,989
He is...
he's truly

1786
01:35:01,029 --> 01:35:05,489
an amazing
amazing little person.

1787
01:35:27,869 --> 01:35:29,449
Excuse me.

1788
01:35:29,489 --> 01:35:31,989
Of course.

1789
01:35:47,199 --> 01:35:49,279
Buenas noches.

1790
01:35:54,739 --> 01:35:58,319
It's a much tougher game
out there for women.

1791
01:36:00,029 --> 01:36:03,319
Nature deals us
some tricky cards.

1792
01:36:03,369 --> 01:36:05,319
Is that so hard
for you to understand?

1793
01:36:05,369 --> 01:36:07,159
No.

1794
01:36:07,199 --> 01:36:09,949
I don't know, Mom.
I just...

1795
01:36:12,569 --> 01:36:15,029
So I guess you're not
going into finance?

1796
01:36:15,069 --> 01:36:17,819
I don't think that having money
makes it any easier.

1797
01:36:17,869 --> 01:36:20,449
You know,
I know that now.

1798
01:36:23,619 --> 01:36:26,029
It's okay.

1799
01:36:26,069 --> 01:36:27,909
It's your life.

1800
01:36:27,949 --> 01:36:29,989
Personally, I think
you're making a big mistake.

1801
01:36:34,529 --> 01:36:37,569
But it is your life.

1802
01:36:37,619 --> 01:36:40,119
I want you
to be happy.

1803
01:36:45,369 --> 01:36:47,239
Hey.

1804
01:36:47,279 --> 01:36:49,159
- Hayden.
Oh, that's right.

1805
01:36:49,199 --> 01:36:51,319
I forgot to mention
his name is Hayden.

1806
01:36:51,369 --> 01:36:53,409
And once I finally
let myself say it,

1807
01:36:53,449 --> 01:36:55,409
it was a habit that
was pretty hard to break.

1808
01:36:55,449 --> 01:36:57,369
It is... it's going
pretty good actually.

1809
01:36:57,369 --> 01:36:59,699
There's more scholarships
out there than I thought.

1810
01:36:59,739 --> 01:37:01,989
So why are you
so late?

1811
01:37:02,029 --> 01:37:05,159
Because I have
something for you.

1812
01:37:05,199 --> 01:37:07,449
It's from
your former employer.

1813
01:37:07,489 --> 01:37:08,529
What?

1814
01:37:08,569 --> 01:37:10,659
She cornered me
on the 12th floor,

1815
01:37:10,699 --> 01:37:14,489
figured I could get
to you before she could.

1816
01:37:17,319 --> 01:37:19,989
I don't want to
read this.

1817
01:37:20,029 --> 01:37:22,619
- Why don't I read it to you?
- Okay.

1818
01:37:28,279 --> 01:37:29,739
"Dear Annie...

1819
01:37:32,069 --> 01:37:35,159
It's been several months
since we've spoken.

1820
01:37:35,199 --> 01:37:38,619
Even so, the things you said
on that tape haunt me every day.

1821
01:37:38,659 --> 01:37:42,369
And now looking back,
I don't know what to say

1822
01:37:42,409 --> 01:37:44,489
except thank you...

1823
01:37:44,529 --> 01:37:47,239
- and I'm sorry."
"And I'm sorry.

1824
01:37:47,279 --> 01:37:49,409
You were so right.

1825
01:37:49,449 --> 01:37:53,409
Of all my privileges,
Grayer is my greatest.

1826
01:37:53,449 --> 01:37:56,909
I desperately needed
someone to show me that.

1827
01:37:56,949 --> 01:37:58,619
You did.

1828
01:37:58,659 --> 01:38:01,909
And for that,
I owe you the world.

1829
01:38:03,319 --> 01:38:05,279
You may or may not
be surprised

1830
01:38:05,319 --> 01:38:07,319
to learn that
I've left my husband.

1831
01:38:07,369 --> 01:38:09,409
Not out of the jar.

1832
01:38:09,449 --> 01:38:11,159
Try it.

1833
01:38:12,569 --> 01:38:14,569
Any man who made me
feel desperate enough

1834
01:38:14,619 --> 01:38:17,279
to feign a pregnancy
wasn't worth fighting for.

1835
01:38:17,319 --> 01:38:19,069
Isn't it good?

1836
01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:23,619
Yeah.

1837
01:38:23,659 --> 01:38:25,029
Yeah, it is good.

1838
01:38:25,069 --> 01:38:27,489
So I'm pretty confident
that in time

1839
01:38:27,529 --> 01:38:29,319
we'll be getting
along just fine.

1840
01:38:29,369 --> 01:38:31,159
Yeah, it's really good.

1841
01:38:31,199 --> 01:38:33,819
It's really good.

1842
01:38:33,869 --> 01:38:37,409
Please know that I wish
you all the best in life.

1843
01:38:37,449 --> 01:38:39,569
- Sincerely..."
- "Sincerely...

1844
01:38:39,619 --> 01:38:41,869
Alexandra.

1845
01:38:41,909 --> 01:38:43,949
P. S...

1846
01:38:46,699 --> 01:38:50,029
I'm happy to report that Grayer asks
for you a little bit less

1847
01:38:50,069 --> 01:38:53,319
every day and every night."

1848
01:39:02,779 --> 01:39:04,529
- Come on.
- Okay.

1849
01:39:04,569 --> 01:39:05,819
Let's get out of here.

1850
01:39:05,869 --> 01:39:07,659
Catching the Yankees game
with my dad tonight.

1851
01:39:07,699 --> 01:39:09,949
- Sounds wonderful.
- Yeah.

1852
01:39:09,989 --> 01:39:13,909
There's a popular belief
amongst anthropologists

1853
01:39:13,949 --> 01:39:17,909
that you must immerse
yourself in an unfamiliar world

1854
01:39:17,949 --> 01:39:21,949
in order to truly
understand your own.

1855
01:39:23,159 --> 01:39:25,659
I've probably gotta
get going soon actually.

1856
01:39:28,529 --> 01:39:30,119
See you
later tonight, okay?

1857
01:39:30,159 --> 01:39:31,909
Yeah.

1858
01:39:31,949 --> 01:39:34,119
I certainly hope so.

1859
01:39:38,909 --> 01:39:40,989
In conclusion,

1860
01:39:41,029 --> 01:39:43,239
I hope this field diary
has been illuminating

1861
01:39:43,279 --> 01:39:46,659
for those considering my application
to graduate school.

1862
01:39:48,199 --> 01:39:50,069
It certainly has been
for me.

1863
01:39:50,119 --> 01:39:52,279
# Oh yeah #

1864
01:39:55,199 --> 01:39:58,069
After a lost summer
of being Nanny,

1865
01:39:58,119 --> 01:40:00,779
I finally got to know Annie.

1866
01:40:05,119 --> 01:40:07,409
Thanks to a little man
named Grayer,

1867
01:40:07,449 --> 01:40:10,369
I only had to trek
across the Hudson River

1868
01:40:10,369 --> 01:40:13,369
to make this most
amazing discovery.

1869
01:40:13,369 --> 01:40:15,199
- # I won't let you down #
- # Freedom #

1870
01:40:15,239 --> 01:40:17,699
- # I will not give you up #
- # Freedom #

1871
01:40:17,739 --> 01:40:19,159
# Have some faith
in the sound #

1872
01:40:19,199 --> 01:40:21,119
# You got to give
what you take #

1873
01:40:21,159 --> 01:40:22,659
# Freedom #

1874
01:40:22,699 --> 01:40:24,659
# I won't let you down #

1875
01:40:24,739 --> 01:40:27,569
- # Freedom #
- # So please don't give me up. #

1876
01:40:32,409 --> 01:40:34,449
# Wake up one morning #

1877
01:40:34,529 --> 01:40:37,529
# You realize #

1878
01:40:37,569 --> 01:40:40,619
# Your life is one
big compromise #

1879
01:40:40,659 --> 01:40:42,319
# Compromise #

1880
01:40:42,369 --> 01:40:47,029
# Stuck in the job you swore
was only temporary #

1881
01:40:47,069 --> 01:40:48,909
# Was only temporary #

1882
01:40:48,949 --> 01:40:51,909
# Yeah #

1883
01:40:51,949 --> 01:40:55,069
# Feel like the world
is passing you by #

1884
01:40:55,119 --> 01:40:56,819
# Doo-doo-doo doo-doo #

1885
