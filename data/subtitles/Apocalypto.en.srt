{733}{922}"A great civilization is not conquered from without|until it has destroyed itself from within."|W. Durant
{5142}{5189}The heart...
{5380}{5414}...for 'Smoke Frog'.
{5416}{5446}Thank you.
{5594}{5643}This liver for 'Curl Nose'.
{5651}{5693}Thank you.
{5808}{5838}'Cocoa Leaf'...
{5842}{5870}...the ears.
{5874}{5905}Thank you.
{5974}{6011}And for you 'Blunted'...
{6078}{6117}...the balls.
{6196}{6223}Not this again.
{6234}{6258}I'm helping you.
{6262}{6290}Then you eat them!
{6294}{6350}I don't need them.|Neither do the rest of the fellows.
{6352}{6377}Do you fellows?
{6378}{6397}No.
{6398}{6422}Of course not!
{6423}{6454}Sometimes!
{6459}{6478}What do you think?
{6487}{6506}No!
{6508}{6530}No, no!
{6544}{6586}But how many times does it take?
{6592}{6655}I have eight older sisters|and one brother.
{6663}{6745}Father took tapir balls all ten times.
{7718}{7750}Shall I tell him?
{7799}{7854}I'm sorry. The balls are useless.
{7908}{7937}You've never had them?
{7944}{8003}Couldn't tell you what they taste like.
{8027}{8054}None of you?
{8102}{8166}No, but it's been fun watching you...
{8306}{8330}This was your idea!
{8402}{8433}Get him off me!
{8598}{8637}Calm down!
{9055}{9126}Why do you let them treat you like this?
{9139}{9175}Be strong.
{9191}{9225}Where is your pride?
{9346}{9419}It all works...Yes?
{9502}{9530}Yes...
{9543}{9610}...I just can't make children.
{9740}{9802}There is something I will tell you...
{9818}{9897}...but I warn you, it's very powerful.
{9936}{9955}What do you speak of?
{9974}{10013}The soanzo leaf.
{10046}{10079}The soanzo leaf?
{10086}{10150}From the great marshes in the south...
{10266}{10338}This is what gave me my 10 children.
{10490}{10543}No! No! Wait...
{10575}{10631}You have to rub them on...down there.
{10648}{10702}Just before you next try.
{10708}{10758}Apply it generously...
{10868}{10918}I don't know how to thank you.
{10966}{11042}If this works...|maybe she'll stop bothering me.
{11052}{11078}Your wife?
{11090}{11134}No, her mother.
{11142}{11199}The old hag wants grandchildren.
{11428}{11466}Give me some meat.
{11478}{11526}Here, work on this...
{11535}{11579}...pure meat...
{11619}{11675}...ball breath.
{13220}{13385}What do you want?
{14715}{14839}I am 'Flint Sky'. I have hunted|this forest from the day I came of age.
{14875}{14981}My father hunted this forest|with me and before me.
{15020}{15066}'Jaguar Paw', my son.
{15074}{15130}He hunts this forest with me.
{15166}{15250}He will hunt it with his son|after I am gone.
{15734}{15766}A good catch?
{15786}{15834}Good waters here.
{15898}{15933}The forest gives much here.
{16079}{16126}We ask only to pass through.
{16146}{16178}Pass.
{16318}{16362}Keep safe as you pass.
{16450}{16487}Let's go.
{17370}{17422}Our lands were ravaged.
{17442}{17489}We seek a new beginning.
{17656}{17694}Your lands were ravaged?
{17783}{17822}Yes...
{17854}{17918}We seek a new beginning...
{17932}{17962}Be still.
{17968}{17990}My son!
{18038}{18069}Be still.
{18192}{18223}Back to the village.
{19032}{19150}I ask you not to speak|of what you saw in the forest today.
{19243}{19294}You are troubled.
{19300}{19342}Yes, I am.
{19738}{19837}Those people in the forest,|what did you see on them?
{19850}{19878}I do not understand.
{19904}{19939}Fear.
{20018}{20090}Deep rotting fear.
{20103}{20165}They were infected by it.
{20186}{20217}Did you see?
{20230}{20282}Fear is a sickness.
{20408}{20507}It will crawl into the soul|of anyone who engages it.
{20550}{20650}It has tainted your peace already.
{20703}{20802}I did not raise you|to see you live with fear.
{20862}{20903}Strike it from your heart.
{20908}{20973}Do not bring it into our village.
{20986}{21073}At first light|we will gather with the elders...
{21094}{21170}...at the sacred hill of our fathers.
{21188}{21290}There we will call on|their spirits to guide us.
{21558}{21599}Oh, here he is!
{21622}{21654}The big lump!
{21674}{21710}He's useless.
{21726}{21762}He can't do it.
{21806}{21842}You! Yes you!
{21859}{21941}With your height and your girth.|You have deceived us.
{21966}{21997}Get inside!
{22130}{22166}Damn you! Get in there!
{22174}{22210}Old woman, please.
{22220}{22243}Move it!
{22348}{22383}You don't work!
{22444}{22479}What are you laughing about?
{22670}{22778}Give me a grandchild|or I will have you replaced.
{22806}{22851}Mother, that's enough.
{22875}{22950}Do not come out until you make a child.
{22990}{23026}Two would be better!
{23032}{23054}What?
{23094}{23142}Twins you oaf.
{23352}{23370}Mother.
{23394}{23498}Can you go away?|He says he can't with you sitting there.
{23508}{23541}Just get busy.
{23571}{23602}Mom...
{23714}{23749}She's gone.
{24794}{24859}Mother, what do you say we should|have at the feast tonight?
{24866}{24930}I have tapir...|but I also found this boy.
{24947}{24965}I say boy.
{24970}{24991}Roasted!
{24998}{25061}The tapir smells better.|I think it's more fresh.
{25070}{25117}No Dad! No! It's me! It's me!
{25122}{25189}I'll just hang the boy here|in case we change our minds.
{25274}{25291}Wait...
{25296}{25365}That's our 'Turtles Run'.|That's our eldest.
{25370}{25429}Yes it's me. It's your eldest!
{25450}{25530}In that case, a crush for my eldest...
{25616}{25671}...and a crush for my youngest.
{25702}{25758}Tapir it is.
{27342}{27377}One day, old man!
{27390}{27446}One day you won't be able|to run anymore!
{27870}{27946}And a Man sat alone.
{27980}{28041}Drenched deep in sadness.
{28058}{28125}And all the animals|drew near to him and said:
{28140}{28231}"We do not like to see you so sad...
{28274}{28357}"Ask us for whatever you wish|and you shall have it."
{28382}{28486}The Man said:|"I want to have good sight."
{28520}{28597}The vulture replied:|"You shall have mine."
{28670}{28746}The Man said: "I want to be strong."
{28835}{28878}The jaguar said:
{28934}{29005}"You shall be strong like me."
{29052}{29193}Then the Man said: "I long|to know the secrets of the earth."
{29230}{29350}The serpent replied:|"I will show them to you."
{29395}{29455}And so it went with all the animals.
{29496}{29562}And when the Man had|all the gifts that they could give...
{29566}{29606}...he left.
{29643}{29698}Then the owl said to the other animals:
{29720}{29813}"Now the Man knows much|and is able to do many things...
{29839}{29919}"Suddenly I am afraid."
{29996}{30063}The deer said:|"The Man has all that he needs."
{30090}{30138}"Now his sadness will stop."
{30154}{30202}But the owl replied: "No."
{30266}{30334}"I saw a hole in the Man...
{30358}{30449}"Deep like a hunger|he will never fill...
{30474}{30582}"It is what makes him sad|and what makes him want."
{30660}{30734}"He will go on taking and taking...
{30762}{30839}"Until one day the World will say:
{30858}{30957}"I am no more|and I have nothing left to give."
{32078}{32122}Come back to me...
{32226}{32270}Come back to me.
{32963}{33011}My son is dancing.
{33052}{33103}Your son is happy.
{34359}{34399}What do you want?
{34783}{34825}Run!
{35198}{35294}Now that you're up,|can you please kill that dog?
{35610}{35659}The dog.
{37760}{37798}Get up! Get up! Now!
{39614}{39653}Go to the forest.
{39663}{39707}Run! Do not look back.
{40326}{40370}No! No! I am afraid!
{40378}{40427}Look into my eyes. Look into my eyes.
{40435}{40461}Be strong...
{40471}{40498}I am afraid!
{40512}{40549}Be strong.
{41950}{41970}Tie him up!
{43844}{43869}Father!
{43902}{43954}The others. I have to help.
{43982}{44023}No, don't leave us!
{44030}{44094}I will come back, I promise.
{44102}{44130}Don't you leave!
{44138}{44158}I promise.
{44159}{44181}Stay, please stay.
{44186}{44214}Father, don't go.
{45571}{45605}Very nice.
{46732}{46757}Stop!
{46968}{46999}Tie him up!
{47104}{47138}I want him alive.
{47630}{47661}Sorry Father.
{48119}{48165}That's enough!
{48419}{48462}Stand him up.
{48647}{48686}Move away.
{49018}{49061}My son.
{49322}{49365}Don't be afraid.
{50763}{50822}Almost...
{51180}{51242}...that's your name.
{51266}{51342}"Almost".
{51723}{51782}Our life is over.
{51912}{51943}Shame...
{52136}{52166}Shame!
{52266}{52315}Cowards!
{57438}{57481}Let's move!
{60830}{60862}We move out now.
{60872}{60906}They are back.
{60979}{61011}Get up!
{61078}{61113}Heave!
{61286}{61351}Cut Rock, you forgot to duck.
{61423}{61454}Hold still.
{61687}{61714}Can you see?
{61772}{61794}Yes.
{61806}{61849}Get back to your line.
{63322}{63350}Come with us...
{64606}{64634}Get up.
{64936}{64990}Leave him alone, "Almost".
{65042}{65087}I said get up.
{65772}{65814}Up, up...
{65826}{65863}...that's it.
{65914}{65946}Let's go!
{66039}{66109}This man is a good friend of yours...
{66946}{66993}Don't worry...
{67078}{67126}I'll take care of them.
{67196}{67251}They are mine now.
{67426}{67523}Gentle 'Ixchel'. Tender mother of mercy.
{67567}{67690}Keep them from harm. Please. Keep them.
{68551}{68590}One more.
{69156}{69197}Ready?
{70658}{70695}Hold on! Hold on!
{70790}{70827}Wait...
{70864}{70907}...let's see what happens.
{71099}{71121}That's it!
{71294}{71323}Hurry!
{71346}{71393}Pull! Be strong!
{71850}{71894}Yes! You did it!
{71986}{72026}Good work!
{72334}{72399}Can you breathe?...Good.
{73114}{73135}Wait here.
{73935}{73975}What's become of my capture?
{74066}{74101}Dead weight.
{74142}{74195}He nearly took the rest with him.
{74250}{74290}I let him go.
{74392}{74434}You. Let him go?
{74603}{74687}Shall we now do what you want?
{74791}{74862}Let us try that.
{75420}{75487}Don't let any others go.
{75647}{75678}Let's move.
{76044}{76095}Get up "Almost".
{76122}{76207}We don't want to lose you just yet.
{77410}{77458}Stand up, boy.
{77668}{77729}You proved yourself today, my son.
{77746}{77837}You're now worthy to stand|with the rest of us.
{77898}{77959}Thank you Father.
{78200}{78234}Take it...
{78251}{78281}...it's yours.
{78379}{78442}It has taken many lives.
{78739}{78774}Get some rest.
{79122}{79150}Resting brothers...
{79156}{79237}...fathers, mothers, wives.
{79262}{79362}You felt the cold|of this day's early morning.
{79384}{79485}Now you cannot feel|the coldness of its night.
{79550}{79598}She stopped screaming...
{79650}{79722}...too long before they returned,|she had stopped screaming.
{79742}{79806}We saw how she fought them.
{79831}{79875}But in the final moment?
{79914}{79959}If she let them...
{80023}{80134}...the Goddess of the Scaffold|shows no mercy for the weakness...
{80183}{80290}Her soul waits for yours|in the shade of the 'Ceiba' Tree.
{80558}{80599}I need to know.
{80635}{80750}Before this day's end|I will leave this world.
{80796}{80927}I will take as many|of these bastard dogs with me as I can.
{80983}{81098}And I will gladly embrace|the torments of hell...
{81150}{81231}...if I do not find my 'Sky Flower' there.
{81400}{81435}Don't rain.
{82474}{82518}I am walking here.
{83304}{83353}Keep away, she has the sickness.
{83966}{84006}Get back!
{85274}{85326}You fear me?
{85359}{85422}So you should...
{85438}{85519}...all you who are vile.
{85592}{85677}Would you like to know how you will die?
{85846}{85938}The sacred time is near...
{85990}{86090}Beware the blackness of day.
{86166}{86281}Beware the man who brings the jaguar.
{86350}{86462}Behold him reborn from mud and earth...
{86488}{86629}For the one he takes you to|will cancel the sky...
{86656}{86725}...and scratch out the earth.
{86752}{86807}Scratch you out.
{86838}{86902}And end your world.
{87060}{87135}He's with us now.
{87302}{87370}...day will be like night.
{87383}{87493}And the man jaguar|will lead you to your end.
{89194}{89249}Where are they taking us?
{89352}{89458}We tell stories of a place stone-built.
{89494}{89531}What happens there?
{89554}{89587}I do not know...
{89624}{89709}...but the earth bleeds.
{89782}{89827}We are near.
{90827}{90866}Salvation!
{90880}{90954}He has the laughing sickness.
{90978}{91026}He likes you!
{91088}{91118}Help me!
{91318}{91362}Save me.
{91552}{91590}Die like a man.
{95440}{95466}Welcome back.
{95494}{95529}Have you been successful?
{95543}{95570}Ask my son.
{95616}{95649}How many captives?
{95654}{95678}Deal with my son.
{95728}{95754}A fair price.
{95788}{95830}As always, trust me.
{95850}{95866}Good.
{96294}{96359}How much will you give me?
{97839}{97885}Who will buy this woman?
{97910}{97943}No...she's too old.
{97975}{98018}She can be useful.
{98030}{98071}She can cook...clean...
{98108}{98158}Useless old woman!
{98246}{98282}No sale.
{98420}{98453}Go!
{98479}{98510}Go on.
{105722}{105825}These are the days of our great lament.
{105932}{105978}The land thirsts.
{106036}{106142}A great plague infests our crops.
{106210}{106307}The scourge of sickness|afflicts us at whim.
{106451}{106538}They say this strife has made us weak.
{106591}{106635}That we have become empty.
{106702}{106757}They say that we rot.
{107038}{107106}Great people of the banner of the sun...
{107126}{107162}I say...
{107190}{107234}...we are strong.
{107342}{107391}We are a people of destiny.
{107506}{107585}Destined to be the masters of time.
{107682}{107761}Destined to be nearest to the Gods.
{108143}{108218}Mighty 'Kukulkan'!
{108258}{108366}Whose fury could scorch|this earth to oblivion...
{108430}{108485}Let us appease you with this sacrifice.
{108499}{108542}To exalt you in your glory.
{108563}{108626}To make our people prosper.
{108652}{108718}To prepare for your return.
{108791}{108858}Warrior, unafraid and willing!
{108871}{108927}With your blood you renew the world!
{108940}{108983}From age to age.
{109018}{109057}Thanks be to you.
{109410}{109462}The heart of God!
{113387}{113442}Come back to me.
{113656}{113701}Brother...
{113746}{113790}Journey well...
{113842}{113863}No.
{113899}{113926}I can't go.
{113963}{114001}Not now...
{117351}{117467}People of the banner|of the sun do not fear.
{117490}{117534}Rejoice!
{117564}{117637}'Kukulkan' has drunk his fill of blood.
{117646}{117713}We have sated his thirst.
{117740}{117781}Great God.
{117804}{117858}Show us that you are pleased.
{117864}{117950}Let your light return upon us.
{119518}{119567}What of these captives?
{119680}{119726}Dispose of them.
{120551}{120603}I need a finisher.
{120724}{120755}You.
{120902}{120939}Release them.
{121138}{121177}You watch.
{121678}{121703}I'm ready!
{121823}{121894}There's your jungle beyond the corn.
{121966}{121999}Go to it.
{122019}{122053}You're free...
{122098}{122130}...now run.
{122210}{122242}I said run.
{122348}{122378}Run!
{124144}{124170}Not bad.
{124606}{124638}Your turn.
{124826}{124862}Run.
{126682}{126717}Run!
{128503}{128541}Sleep.
{128564}{128618}Sleep, sleep now my son.
{128643}{128699}The pain will be no more.
{128746}{128777}Sleep.
{137170}{137222}He didn't come this way.
{137540}{137587}He's in the trees.
{137630}{137659}Spread out.
{137680}{137717}Keep your eyes up.
{138254}{138279}Quiet.
{138558}{138586}He's coming right at us.
{138987}{139003}There!
{141838}{141903}He would have wanted me to have it.
{141955}{142026}The omen is bad...
{142072}{142146}Mighty 'Ek Chuah' we beg you...
{142176}{142278}Forgive us for this trespass|against your son the Jaguar.
{142326}{142386}The omen is bad...
{142427}{142474}Lift yourself up Drunkards Four...
{142495}{142567}...the omen was foretold...
{142624}{142701}...and now we have a fear more grave...
{142724}{142806}...today I saw the day|become like night...
{142962}{143050}I saw a man run with the Jaguar...
{143143}{143242}...we must not let this man|make feet from us.
{143259}{143287}Enough.
{143378}{143422}Your words mean nothing.
{143455}{143509}He runs because he is afraid.
{143542}{143629}When I catch him,|I will peel his skin...
{143702}{143767}...and have him watch me wear it.
{143952}{143982}We leave now.
{147042}{147070}Stay back.
{148771}{148798}Here!
{149387}{149438}The omen was bad...
{149527}{149554}He's fucked.
{149634}{149667}Help...please...
{149687}{149718}Hanging Moss...
{149758}{149797}See him out.
{150287}{150375}Open your veins. It's quicker.
{150680}{150730}Travel well.
{155186}{155251}So much for your prophecies.
{155392}{155422}It's not over!
{156046}{156085}I am 'Jaguar Paw'...
{156102}{156139}Son of 'Flint Sky'...
{156174}{156254}My father hunted|this forest before me...
{156296}{156343}My name is 'Jaguar Paw'.
{156363}{156402}I am a hunter.
{156440}{156494}This is my forest.
{156522}{156631}And my sons will hunt it|with their sons after I am gone...
{156700}{156730}Come on!
{156794}{156834}We are going over.
{156848}{156914}We climb down around.
{156944}{156994}We cannot let him get away.
{157011}{157038}We cannot afford...
{157523}{157574}We all jump.
{161818}{161858}I am 'Jaguar Paw'.
{161902}{161946}This is my forest.
{161996}{162061}And I am not afraid.
{165116}{165178}You go. I'll wait here.
{173078}{173122}Almost...
{173766}{173830}Resting fathers, fly me your strength.
{174478}{174521}Get up here.
{174878}{174915}Go back!
{175620}{175637}Quick!
{175651}{175674}Hurry up!
{184950}{184994}What are they?
{185034}{185078}They bring men.
{185190}{185235}Should we go to them?
{185434}{185478}We should go to the forest.
{185643}{185689}To seek a new beginning.
{185812}{185846}Come 'Turtles Run'...
{186843}{186877}THE END
