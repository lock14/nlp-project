3
00:02:05,852 --> 00:02:06,760
Marcus.

4
00:02:14,591 --> 00:02:15,899
How are you?

5
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,098
It's been an hour.

6
00:02:21,867 --> 00:02:25,627
I thought I'd try...
one last time.

7
00:02:25,628 --> 00:02:29,421
You should have stayed
in San Francisco, Dr. Kogan.

8
00:02:32,598 --> 00:02:37,183
By signing this consent form,
you'll be donating your body to a noble cause.

9
00:02:38,747 --> 00:02:42,760
You'd...
have a second chance...

10
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:46,133
through my research
to live again.

11
00:02:46,134 --> 00:02:48,103
You know what I did.

12
00:02:48,104 --> 00:02:51,676
My brother and two cops
are dead because of me.

13
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:55,366
I'm not lookin'
for a second chance.

14
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:02,935
But I'm not the only one
with a death sentence, am I?

15
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,879
Do you think I'm gonna kill
your cancer this permanent?

16
00:03:10,871 --> 00:03:13,295
I'm not worried
about myself.

17
00:03:14,555 --> 00:03:18,157
I'm worried about
the future of the human race.

18
00:03:19,671 --> 00:03:21,500
I'll sell it to you.

19
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:23,943
For what?

20
00:03:23,943 --> 00:03:25,938
A kiss.

21
00:03:42,771 --> 00:03:45,188
So that's what
death tastes like.

22
00:04:03,568 --> 00:04:05,883
You are doing something
very noble.

23
00:04:05,884 --> 00:04:09,683
I'm guilty. Just cut me up
until there's nothing left.

24
00:04:14,807 --> 00:04:18,538
That I walk through the valley
of the Shadow of Death.

25
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,564
I will fear no evil.

26
00:04:20,565 --> 00:04:23,161
For thou art with me,

27
00:04:23,161 --> 00:04:27,374
thy rod and my staff,
they comfort me.

28
00:04:42,524 --> 00:04:44,021
Do you have
any last words?

29
00:06:19,113 --> 00:06:24,365
<i>Bag Art, this is Black Hawk Six. Result in outer
Skynet target. TTO 11 seconds, taken close.</i>

30
00:07:00,598 --> 00:07:01,906
- Come on, come on!
- Move, move!

31
00:07:12,026 --> 00:07:14,797
<i>Connor is on the ground.</i>

32
00:07:19,173 --> 00:07:20,740
This mission
is a quick in-and-out.

33
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:24,574
Command teams the information on those
computers should be at the highest priority.

34
00:07:58,923 --> 00:08:00,887
Connor, there's no sign
of the machines. They're gone.

35
00:08:00,887 --> 00:08:04,658
We too quiet. It's almost like
they were waiting for us.

36
00:08:25,747 --> 00:08:30,370
What the hell's that smell, man?
Whoa! You're seeing this?

37
00:08:54,365 --> 00:09:00,176
Olson. Objective located.
There's something else you'd have to see.

38
00:09:19,118 --> 00:09:21,312
We got what we came for, Barbaros.
The clock's ticking.

39
00:09:21,815 --> 00:09:25,037
Spread out, secure the perimeter.
I got a big gap over here.

40
00:09:25,038 --> 00:09:27,238
Why didn't we know
about this?

41
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:31,918
Sir, I think this is what Command's
looking for. I'm in their source code.

42
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:35,491
These people are being taken
up north to San Francisco.

43
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:37,494
Some sort of R&D project,
for a new Terminator.

44
00:09:37,495 --> 00:09:39,756
Send it to Command.

45
00:09:39,758 --> 00:09:41,633
It's uploading,
I need two minutes.

46
00:09:41,634 --> 00:09:44,005
Wait, wait, wait.
Go back. Go back!

47
00:09:44,006 --> 00:09:45,894
Stop!

48
00:09:50,597 --> 00:09:52,836
- T-800.
- A new Terminator.

49
00:09:54,809 --> 00:09:56,445
Thought you said
it would be...

50
00:09:56,511 --> 00:09:56,544
It's worse.

51
00:09:57,947 --> 00:10:00,447
Connor, get your nose out of that.
None of your business.

52
00:10:00,551 --> 00:10:01,548
You're not
leading this mission.

53
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:04,945
Alright, let's cut these
sorry bastards loose. Come on, let's go!

54
00:10:04,946 --> 00:10:07,542
- Kirk, come in.
- What's that?

55
00:10:10,403 --> 00:10:11,772
Connor,
get your ass top-side.

56
00:10:11,773 --> 00:10:13,849
Remind those men
they need to answer me on the radio,

57
00:10:13,975 --> 00:10:14,950
even if they're dead.

58
00:10:29,524 --> 00:10:30,370
<i>Connor,
get those men to respond.</i>

59
00:10:29,524 --> 00:10:33,375
Olson,
something's wrong up here.

60
00:10:44,561 --> 00:10:46,056
<i>Top-side, come in!</i>

61
00:10:49,488 --> 00:10:51,765
Help out enemy aircraft,
I'm in pursuit.

62
00:10:54,182 --> 00:10:59,070
There are human prisoners
aboard there. Get after 'em!

63
00:11:14,477 --> 00:11:17,884
Pay to transpond the plane.
Connor, we're joining you, top--

64
00:12:58,898 --> 00:13:01,687
<i>Bravo Ten, Bravo Ten.
Do you copy? Over.</i>

65
00:13:07,311 --> 00:13:09,772
<i>Eagle White to Bravo Ten.
Bravo Ten, do you copy? Over.</i>

66
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:16,028
<i>Bravo Ten, Bravo Ten,
do you copy? Over.</i>

67
00:13:19,886 --> 00:13:22,732
- Here.
- <i>Bravo Ten, identify. Over.</i>

68
00:13:24,356 --> 00:13:25,562
Connor!

69
00:13:25,562 --> 00:13:27,923
<i>We'll send units
to the extraction point.</i>

70
00:13:27,966 --> 00:13:28,924
<i>How many survivors are outside?
Over.<i>

71
00:13:28,926 --> 00:13:30,576
One.

72
00:13:32,576 --> 00:13:33,735
<i>Copy.</i>

73
00:14:39,322 --> 00:14:41,463
Return to base, sir?

74
00:14:41,465 --> 00:14:47,133
- RGB?
- Negative. Take me to Command.

75
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,600
Command!

76
00:14:50,601 --> 00:14:52,703
Roger, re-routing.

77
00:15:12,251 --> 00:15:15,092
Request has been denied.
Command doesn't want to give up their position.

78
00:15:15,094 --> 00:15:17,620
- Radio cogs, over.
- Are they down there?

79
00:15:17,621 --> 00:15:19,621
Request
has been denied, sir.

80
00:15:19,623 --> 00:15:22,316
Need to go home.
It's straight from the top.

81
00:15:26,138 --> 00:15:27,826
You open up that ramp!

82
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:31,309
And you tell them...
I need divers for a log-in.

83
00:15:31,311 --> 00:15:37,099
- Now!
- This is crazy.

84
00:16:05,879 --> 00:16:10,517
John Connor,
prophesied leader of the Resistance.

85
00:16:10,522 --> 00:16:11,831
Soldier, you put every man
and woman in this sub

86
00:16:12,019 --> 00:16:14,836
in jeopardy with
your little frogman stunt.

87
00:16:15,823 --> 00:16:19,647
- What the hell are you doing here?
- What did we find down there?

88
00:16:19,648 --> 00:16:21,857
You'll be pleased down
the need-to-know basis.

89
00:16:21,859 --> 00:16:26,356
Well, I need to know, because my men
<i>died</i> down in that hole.

90
00:16:26,357 --> 00:16:28,243
What did we find
down there?

91
00:16:28,244 --> 00:16:30,393
We found the solution,
Connor,

92
00:16:30,394 --> 00:16:33,832
that can end this war,
once and for all.

93
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:40,375
We know the machines use short-wave
transmitters to communicate.

94
00:16:40,376 --> 00:16:45,538
Our intel has located a hidden signal
under the primary channel.

95
00:16:45,539 --> 00:16:49,538
It allows for direct control
on the machines.

96
00:16:49,538 --> 00:16:54,375
Skynet's a machine, and like all machines,
it has an off-switch.

97
00:16:54,376 --> 00:16:58,565
- Does it work?
- Will it work? Yes.

98
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,451
Have we field-tested it?
No.

99
00:17:02,437 --> 00:17:03,500
Give it to me.

100
00:17:05,038 --> 00:17:06,334
I'll do it.

101
00:17:07,332 --> 00:17:08,570
I'll test it.

102
00:17:11,671 --> 00:17:14,564
Connor, you can stay Comm unit.
Have a nice one record.

103
00:17:14,565 --> 00:17:16,416
Alright.

104
00:17:17,824 --> 00:17:18,957
Alright.

105
00:17:20,634 --> 00:17:23,345
Leave Connor top-side.
Prepare for lock-out.

106
00:17:28,386 --> 00:17:29,943
Connor,
we do this right...

107
00:17:29,944 --> 00:17:32,237
The war is over.

108
00:17:32,238 --> 00:17:35,355
Remind our offensive
in 4 days.

109
00:17:38,547 --> 00:17:40,883
Connor...

110
00:17:40,884 --> 00:17:43,464
These are the codes
for the signal.

111
00:17:45,193 --> 00:17:47,319
- Good luck.
- Why four days?

112
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:50,363
A kill list was intercepted
from Skynet.

113
00:17:50,364 --> 00:17:53,372
It says everyone in this room
will be dead by week's end.

114
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:55,535
You are number two
on the list.

115
00:17:57,775 --> 00:18:00,241
- Well, who's number one?
- I don't know.

116
00:18:00,242 --> 00:18:03,306
A civilian.
Kyle Reese.

117
00:18:43,712 --> 00:18:45,076
Barnes...

118
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:51,405
My brother...
He didn't make it, did he?

119
00:19:39,910 --> 00:19:43,221
<i>This is tape number 28.
It's Sarah Connor to my son, John.</i>

120
00:19:43,222 --> 00:19:47,250
<i>What's most difficult for me
is trying to decide what to tell you</i>

121
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:48,483
<i>and what not to.</i>

122
00:19:48,484 --> 00:19:50,607
<i>Should I tell you
about your father?</i>

123
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:54,952
<i>Will it affect your decision to send
him back in time to protect me,</i>

124
00:19:54,953 --> 00:19:56,927
<i>knowing that
he is your father?</i>

125
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:00,262
<i>And he'll be younger than you,
only a teenager,when you meet him.</i>

126
00:20:00,263 --> 00:20:03,287
<i>Kyle. Person could go crazy
thinking about this.</i>

127
00:20:03,288 --> 00:20:07,059
<i>But if you don't send Kyle,
you can never be</i>

128
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,944
<i>and Skynet will win the war.</i>

129
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,987
Want to talk about it?

130
00:20:17,826 --> 00:20:19,933
Kyle is out there
somewhere alone

131
00:20:19,934 --> 00:20:21,705
and Skynet
is hunting him.

132
00:20:21,707 --> 00:20:24,549
What about the signal?

133
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,909
What do you think?

134
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:38,701
- If it works, it's incredible.
- Yeah.

135
00:20:38,702 --> 00:20:41,027
- We have to be careful.
- I agree.

136
00:20:42,003 --> 00:20:44,058
- But we have to try.
- Okay.

137
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:48,589
Alright then, start with something small,
something more familiar with.

138
00:20:51,704 --> 00:20:54,911
We should try to capture a Hydrobot,
bring it in for testing.

139
00:20:58,579 --> 00:21:00,013
What is it, John?

140
00:21:01,877 --> 00:21:05,579
Kill Kyle Reese,
reset the future.

141
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,549
No John Connor.

142
00:22:32,732 --> 00:22:34,447
Come with me
if you want to live.

143
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:40,734
What is that?

144
00:23:41,887 --> 00:23:44,054
She doesn't talk,
but you need to start.

145
00:23:45,595 --> 00:23:46,828
Where did you
get that jacket?

146
00:23:46,829 --> 00:23:48,865
The other guy
didn't need it.

147
00:23:50,411 --> 00:23:53,317
You see that red?
It stands for blood.

148
00:23:53,317 --> 00:23:57,670
It's a symbol of the Resistance.
You're obviously <i>not</i> a Resistance fighter,

149
00:23:59,911 --> 00:24:00,671
so take it off!

150
00:24:02,513 --> 00:24:05,289
You oint a gun at someone,
you better be ready to pull the trigger.

151
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,431
I'm going to ask you
one more time.

152
00:24:14,123 --> 00:24:16,230
- What the hell was that thing?
- A Terminator.

153
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:18,409
T-600.

154
00:24:22,643 --> 00:24:24,085
What day is it?

155
00:24:24,086 --> 00:24:26,291
What year?

156
00:24:29,486 --> 00:24:32,066
2018.

157
00:24:33,730 --> 00:24:35,340
What happened here?

158
00:24:38,034 --> 00:24:40,169
Judgement Day happened.

159
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,369
I gotta get outta here.

160
00:24:45,371 --> 00:24:48,590
You can't go on foot.
Machines will cut you down.

161
00:24:48,592 --> 00:24:50,555
You need speed.

162
00:24:50,556 --> 00:24:52,772
I need a car.

163
00:24:52,773 --> 00:24:54,834
Look, there's some by
Griffith Observatory.

164
00:24:54,835 --> 00:24:57,522
- I don't know now.
- Take me.

165
00:24:59,933 --> 00:25:01,156
Get down!

166
00:25:29,736 --> 00:25:31,881
That was
a Hunter Killer.

167
00:25:32,383 --> 00:25:36,150
Thanks to you,
they know we're here.

168
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,482
What's your name,
kid?

169
00:25:40,483 --> 00:25:43,802
Kyle Reese.

170
00:25:46,951 --> 00:25:48,435
Come on.

171
00:25:50,887 --> 00:25:53,855
We burn down the transmitters
so it can't talk to any of its pals

172
00:25:53,855 --> 00:25:56,596
that it can still recieve.

173
00:25:56,596 --> 00:25:58,040
Turn it on!

174
00:25:59,805 --> 00:26:01,557
You got it?

175
00:26:01,558 --> 00:26:03,244
Hold it down!
Hold a bit...

176
00:26:18,097 --> 00:26:21,660
Get me a strap.
Holy shit!

177
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,877
- Just hold it tight.
- The signal has to be continuous.

178
00:26:26,878 --> 00:26:28,954
If there's
any interruption...

179
00:26:38,527 --> 00:26:39,980
Let's rig up
a portable shortwave.

180
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:42,076
I need to test it on something larger
in the field.

181
00:26:45,526 --> 00:26:46,236
Destroy this thing.

182
00:26:58,307 --> 00:27:01,067
- So where are the cars?
- You don't want to go out after dark.

183
00:27:01,068 --> 00:27:04,982
Hunter Killers have infrared.
Hunt better at night.

184
00:27:04,983 --> 00:27:07,679
We'll all go
tomorrow morning.

185
00:27:12,758 --> 00:27:15,328
- What is that?
- Two-day old of coyote.

186
00:27:17,653 --> 00:27:20,576
Better than three-day old coyote.

187
00:27:37,961 --> 00:27:39,393
- Grab it.
- What?

188
00:27:39,394 --> 00:27:41,622
Grab it.

189
00:27:51,108 --> 00:27:53,142
Magic.

190
00:27:57,978 --> 00:27:59,801
- Got it?
- Yeah.

191
00:27:59,802 --> 00:28:01,704
Thanks.

192
00:28:06,676 --> 00:28:09,310
- Does this radio work?
- No.

193
00:28:09,311 --> 00:28:14,836
My dad tried to fix it, but...
he could never get it to work.

194
00:28:31,249 --> 00:28:32,648
Hold that.

195
00:28:37,859 --> 00:28:41,122
- Where is everybody?
- They're gone.

196
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:44,248
So why are you
still here?

197
00:28:44,249 --> 00:28:47,248
'Cause we're the Resistance.
L.A. branch.

198
00:28:47,249 --> 00:28:49,734
Welcome
to the headquarters.

199
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,973
Resistant to what?

200
00:28:52,974 --> 00:28:57,122
Machines.
Skynet.

201
00:28:57,123 --> 00:28:59,569
- Just the two of you?
- Yeah.

202
00:29:02,055 --> 00:29:04,028
How come you're not wearing
one of these?

203
00:29:04,028 --> 00:29:07,046
'Cause I haven't
earned mine, yet.

204
00:29:17,364 --> 00:29:20,664
I hope
he's listening to this.

205
00:29:22,627 --> 00:29:25,347
We've been fighting a long time,
and we've all lost so very much,

206
00:28:25,275 --> 00:28:28,994
so many loved ones gone.
But you are not alone.

207
00:29:29,945 --> 00:29:33,349
There are pockets of Resistance
all around the planet.

208
00:29:33,351 --> 00:29:36,234
We are at the brink...

209
00:29:37,807 --> 00:29:39,034
Do a sea magic trick.

210
00:29:39,035 --> 00:29:40,573
Hold that up.

211
00:29:44,842 --> 00:29:46,390
Press the button.

212
00:29:50,633 --> 00:29:54,103
<i>If we had to finally...
less than 100 meters.</i>

213
00:29:54,104 --> 00:29:59,915
<i>We've had a lot of firepower but the T-600's
are heavy, and slow their primitive design.</i>

214
00:29:59,916 --> 00:30:01,155
Who is that?

215
00:30:01,156 --> 00:30:04,159
<i>If you can help or no...
then you have one option.</i>

216
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:08,604
Their motor cortex is partially
exposed to the back of their neck.

217
00:30:08,605 --> 00:30:12,449
<i>A knife to this area will disorientate
their tracking device</i>

218
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:15,059
<i>but not for long.</i>
Above all, stay alive.

219
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:20,872
<i>You have no idea how important you are
and how important you will become.</i>

220
00:30:20,873 --> 00:30:24,438
<i>The machines are advancing
even faster than I told you they would.</i>

221
00:30:24,439 --> 00:30:28,378
<i>I've seen it with my own eyes.
They were inventing new Terminators.</i>

222
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:30,067
<i>New ways of killing us.</i>

223
00:30:30,067 --> 00:30:32,708
<i>Skynet is planning
something big.</i>

224
00:30:32,709 --> 00:30:36,315
<i>But the Resistance
is planning something bigger.</i>

225
00:30:39,199 --> 00:30:40,291
This is John Connor.

226
00:30:40,292 --> 00:30:44,634
<i>If you're listening to this,
you are the Resistance.</i>

227
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:48,664
John Connor.

228
00:30:50,326 --> 00:30:52,234
We gotta find this guy.

229
00:31:25,228 --> 00:31:26,673
So...
You get it working?

230
00:31:26,674 --> 00:31:29,673
- Almost.
- Good.

231
00:31:29,673 --> 00:31:32,671
Look, I figure
we head east, right?

232
00:31:32,672 --> 00:31:35,606
We go through the desert, then we can
connect with the Resistance there.

233
00:31:37,365 --> 00:31:40,157
- I'm heading north.
- No. No, no, no, no.

234
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:44,050
The machines control the whole
Northern Sector upto San Francisco.

235
00:31:44,051 --> 00:31:45,124
That's Skynet's central.

236
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:46,900
I have to find someone.

237
00:31:46,901 --> 00:31:49,546
There's a lot that you don't
understand about Skynet, okay?

238
00:31:49,547 --> 00:31:51,365
It's just too dangerous
for us to go there.

239
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,018
What about
the L.A. branch?

240
00:32:01,147 --> 00:32:04,478
Come on, man.
We need to get out of L.A.

241
00:32:14,862 --> 00:32:23,681
[ Song: Rooster
Band: Alice in Chains ]

242
00:32:25,997 --> 00:32:27,596
What is that?

243
00:32:27,597 --> 00:32:31,230
Something my brother
used to listen to.

244
00:32:36,625 --> 00:32:38,012
Star, get out.

245
00:32:41,066 --> 00:32:43,302
Don't look at me
like that, Star.

246
00:32:43,337 --> 00:32:45,160
Get out.
Get out!

247
00:32:48,317 --> 00:32:51,047
You're leaving?
You're gonna leave us?

248
00:32:54,295 --> 00:32:55,467
Ah, I get it.

249
00:32:57,614 --> 00:33:00,390
Do you want to know the difference
between us and the machines?

250
00:33:01,951 --> 00:33:04,199
We bury our dead.

251
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:08,366
But no one is coming
to bury you.

252
00:33:18,785 --> 00:33:20,486
Air attack!

253
00:33:20,487 --> 00:33:23,718
- It's a chopper of a Terminator.
- Go! Drive!

254
00:33:33,073 --> 00:33:35,145
They must have heard
the music.

255
00:33:37,947 --> 00:33:40,162
- Keep the steering.
- I've never driven before.

256
00:34:20,289 --> 00:34:22,641
This thing is pissing me of.

257
00:34:22,641 --> 00:34:24,179
I'll drive!

258
00:34:28,588 --> 00:34:31,224
We're seeing a lot of
enemy movement in L.A.

259
00:34:32,577 --> 00:34:34,396
Any more people
in the area?

260
00:34:35,485 --> 00:34:38,302
No one on the ground. Two 8-10s
in the air. Williams and Marhadi.

261
00:34:38,302 --> 00:34:40,373
Send the birds down.

262
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,545
Guide them to a safe area.

263
00:34:43,545 --> 00:34:46,407
<i>Roger, Coward 6-7
in console.</i>

264
00:34:46,407 --> 00:34:50,255
<i>Ten miles to bring.
Lima-Alpha, 1-2-5-7-9-0-3. Over.</i>

265
00:34:50,257 --> 00:34:53,257
<i>- Copy that.
- Roger, Wild Eagle. Final copy.</i>

266
00:35:52,007 --> 00:35:53,697
Hey, there's someone here.

267
00:35:55,793 --> 00:35:57,891
Get down, now! Move!
Drop your weapons.

268
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:07,396
Is there a problem?

269
00:36:07,431 --> 00:36:09,201
Hey, we saw
your Resistant sign.

270
00:36:09,202 --> 00:36:10,949
The old lady put it there,
not me.

271
00:36:12,485 --> 00:36:13,664
What do you want?

272
00:36:13,664 --> 00:36:15,050
We're looking
for fuel.

273
00:36:15,994 --> 00:36:17,451
The dark season's coming.

274
00:36:17,452 --> 00:36:20,148
We only got enough
for ourselves.

275
00:36:20,150 --> 00:36:23,675
You point that gun at somebody,
you better be ready to pull the trigger.

276
00:36:26,621 --> 00:36:28,224
Put your guns down,
everyone.

277
00:36:32,967 --> 00:36:35,317
Look, we just came
to find the Resistance. That's all.

278
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:38,157
The Resistance?
What a joke!

279
00:36:38,159 --> 00:36:40,577
Fighting those machines
is impossible.

280
00:36:40,577 --> 00:36:42,849
We keep our heads down,
they ignore us.

281
00:36:42,851 --> 00:36:45,059
You keep your heads down
and they'll come for you eventually.

282
00:36:45,059 --> 00:36:46,871
We help you
and maybe they will.

283
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,980
These people
aren't gonna help you.

284
00:36:48,981 --> 00:36:50,414
Let's go.

285
00:36:50,414 --> 00:36:51,690
You're not going anywhere.

286
00:36:51,692 --> 00:36:54,601
Not until this one
gets something to eat.

287
00:37:04,692 --> 00:37:06,396
Bring me a basket.

288
00:37:08,648 --> 00:37:09,925
Here you go.

289
00:37:12,481 --> 00:37:14,931
Come on, help yourself!
Eat up.

290
00:37:23,965 --> 00:37:25,849
Are you alright, son?

291
00:37:27,938 --> 00:37:30,952
It's our food.
Our fuel.

292
00:37:30,954 --> 00:37:33,418
It's not your choice
to make!

293
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,179
Star, Star!

294
00:38:13,181 --> 00:38:16,746
Damn!
You brought them here!

295
00:38:26,559 --> 00:38:28,085
You brought them here.

296
00:38:39,980 --> 00:38:42,262
- Stop, stop!
- Come on, wait.

297
00:38:51,719 --> 00:38:56,929
- Head for the tunnels!
- Truck!

298
00:38:58,722 --> 00:39:00,905
We can't
just run for it.

299
00:39:49,282 --> 00:39:50,724
Shoot it!

300
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:57,202
Go, go, go!

301
00:39:58,768 --> 00:39:59,740
come on!

302
00:40:03,574 --> 00:40:05,039
It didn't work.

303
00:40:05,041 --> 00:40:07,106
Shit!

304
00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:00,547
Throttle Terminators!

305
00:41:13,786 --> 00:41:15,351
Shoot this
son of a bitch!

306
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:34,266
Marcus,
turn right up here.

307
00:41:46,987 --> 00:41:48,170
Hold on!

308
00:41:57,742 --> 00:41:59,960
Where is the other one?

309
00:42:24,597 --> 00:42:25,853
Come on!

310
00:42:25,855 --> 00:42:27,539
Star,
give me the gun.

311
00:42:42,987 --> 00:42:44,302
Hang on!

312
00:42:51,387 --> 00:42:54,382
- Drop the ball!
- Uh, alright.

313
00:44:24,376 --> 00:44:27,782
Kyle!

314
00:44:33,402 --> 00:44:35,615
Marcus! Marcus!

315
00:44:40,538 --> 00:44:42,166
<i>I got my eyes on
two targets.</i>

316
00:44:44,402 --> 00:44:47,061
We've got two bogeys at 270ş. They've never
come this deep before. They're looking for something.

317
00:44:54,135 --> 00:44:56,043
<i>H.K. is down.</i>

318
00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:15,681
<i>We've got an "H.K" porching our six.
Come over by. Breaking off.</i>

319
00:45:22,864 --> 00:45:24,632
Evasive maneuvers
now!

320
00:45:38,532 --> 00:45:40,724
It's got a lock on you.
Break off.

321
00:45:43,313 --> 00:45:45,835
- Eject, Williams, eject!
- <i>Punching out.</i>

322
00:46:04,304 --> 00:46:07,010
There's your transport,
headed northwest,

323
00:46:07,012 --> 00:46:10,405
bearing 2-8-9
towards San Francisco.

324
00:46:12,244 --> 00:46:14,556
First,
test the signal.

325
00:46:14,557 --> 00:46:16,974
And pray it works.

326
00:47:13,967 --> 00:47:15,079
You okay?

327
00:47:15,081 --> 00:47:18,460
Get my knife.
It's in my left boot.

328
00:47:25,927 --> 00:47:28,751
- What's your name?
- Blair Williams.

329
00:47:31,362 --> 00:47:32,661
What's yours?

330
00:47:36,737 --> 00:47:39,125
Name's Marcus.

331
00:47:39,126 --> 00:47:40,996
You can let me down now,
Marcus.

332
00:47:50,056 --> 00:47:52,324
- That thing, where'd it go?
- The transport?

333
00:47:52,326 --> 00:47:55,733
Skynet.
Where the hell are you going?

334
00:47:55,733 --> 00:47:57,041
After it.

335
00:47:58,027 --> 00:48:02,775
Hate to break it to you but, if you've got
friends on that thing. They're good as dead.

336
00:48:02,777 --> 00:48:05,411
The same with you
if you keep walking in that direction.

337
00:48:05,411 --> 00:48:07,867
They've only been dead a while
and I am getting used to it.

338
00:48:07,869 --> 00:48:10,474
Why don't you come with me
to my base?

339
00:48:10,476 --> 00:48:12,715
Connor might know why.

340
00:48:16,668 --> 00:48:18,664
Listen, if you've got a problem
with the machines,

341
00:48:18,666 --> 00:48:20,782
he's definitely the guy
you wanna talk to.

342
00:48:23,387 --> 00:48:25,844
- How far is your base?
- It should be 1 or 2 days hike.

343
00:48:25,844 --> 00:48:28,487
It's that way.

344
00:48:53,827 --> 00:48:55,938
What are you saying?
Speak English!

345
00:48:55,938 --> 00:49:01,277
I was telling him...
It is not true,

346
00:49:01,278 --> 00:49:04,431
- the part of machines killing us.
- They're gonna kill us.

347
00:49:04,431 --> 00:49:05,958
They're gonna kill everyone.

348
00:49:05,958 --> 00:49:09,050
We are in a cattle cart, or we're on
our way to the slaughterhouse.

349
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:10,876
Calm down.

350
00:49:10,876 --> 00:49:12,335
You're not helping.

351
00:49:12,336 --> 00:49:15,476
The most important thing
that we can do right now

352
00:49:15,476 --> 00:49:17,114
is stay alive.

353
00:49:17,114 --> 00:49:19,442
In here and in here.

354
00:49:19,443 --> 00:49:23,235
Alright?
Just stay alive.

355
00:49:38,925 --> 00:49:40,219
Over there.

356
00:49:47,552 --> 00:49:50,925
Find something that can burn.
We'll be at my base tomorrow.

357
00:49:54,431 --> 00:49:55,722
Are you hurt?

358
00:49:57,844 --> 00:49:59,164
I'm fine.

359
00:50:18,536 --> 00:50:20,166
What you got there?

360
00:50:22,951 --> 00:50:24,876
Just some antibiotics.

361
00:50:24,878 --> 00:50:27,992
Antibiotics are hard
to come by these days.

362
00:50:27,994 --> 00:50:31,391
Listen, I don't have much, but...
you're welcome to whatever you need.

363
00:50:33,021 --> 00:50:34,806
We've been watching you.

364
00:50:36,492 --> 00:50:37,757
Looking for this?

365
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:42,327
Come on, guys.
Machines are the enemy.

366
00:50:42,327 --> 00:50:44,061
We're on the same side.

367
00:50:44,063 --> 00:50:47,382
No, no. See, I've got
a couple of friends on my side.

368
00:50:47,382 --> 00:50:49,637
Maybe they can carry you home...

369
00:50:49,639 --> 00:50:51,364
when I'm done with you.

370
00:50:54,150 --> 00:50:56,090
You might want
a chamber around.

371
00:51:37,146 --> 00:51:39,086
Kill me,
you ain't gonna win this war.

372
00:51:45,501 --> 00:51:46,815
Oh, God!

373
00:52:32,778 --> 00:52:34,608
I'm a little cold.

374
00:52:43,083 --> 00:52:44,456
Relax.

375
00:52:47,668 --> 00:52:49,833
I just want
some body heat.

376
00:52:56,065 --> 00:52:58,157
You have
a strong heart.

377
00:53:00,396 --> 00:53:02,896
God,
I love that sound.

378
00:53:09,548 --> 00:53:10,583
Thank you...

379
00:53:11,447 --> 00:53:13,485
for saving me
back there.

380
00:53:14,628 --> 00:53:17,356
I don't meet a lot
of good guys these days.

381
00:53:19,385 --> 00:53:21,170
I'm not a good guy.

382
00:53:27,550 --> 00:53:29,054
You are.

383
00:53:29,056 --> 00:53:31,878
You just don't know it, yet.

384
00:53:41,358 --> 00:53:43,813
Do you think people
deserve a second chance?

385
00:53:47,563 --> 00:53:50,068
Yeah.
I do.

386
00:53:54,202 --> 00:53:56,568
This is it.
Skynet's Valley of Death.

387
00:53:56,570 --> 00:53:58,722
We've never been
this deep before.

388
00:53:58,757 --> 00:54:01,146
We've got to be sure
this thing works in their territory.

389
00:54:01,148 --> 00:54:03,255
On the bigger machines.

390
00:54:14,429 --> 00:54:15,929
That will bring them in.

391
00:54:32,637 --> 00:54:34,213
H.K.
They're coming.

392
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:57,318
Turn it up!

393
00:55:20,340 --> 00:55:22,476
It works, man.
The signal works.

394
00:55:22,476 --> 00:55:23,972
It's beautiful!

395
00:55:34,938 --> 00:55:38,010
- Commander Ashdown.
- <i>Connor, tell me it works.</i>

396
00:55:38,045 --> 00:55:41,155
It works. That is affirmative.
The signal works.

397
00:55:41,157 --> 00:55:42,621
Good.

398
00:55:42,621 --> 00:55:45,530
The attack commences tomorrow
at 0400, worldwide.

399
00:55:45,532 --> 00:55:48,547
<i>Your unit will be at the board
of a bombing in Skynet Central.</i>

400
00:55:48,548 --> 00:55:51,356
What is the extraction plan
for the prisoners?

401
00:55:51,358 --> 00:55:53,862
<i>Extraction plan?
There is no extraction plan.</i>

402
00:55:53,864 --> 00:55:55,369
We're gonna level the place.

403
00:55:56,335 --> 00:56:01,476
Negative, I told you. Skynet Central
is filled with human prisoners.

404
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:04,791
This is war, Connor.

405
00:56:04,793 --> 00:56:07,186
Leadership has its cost.
You, above all, should know that.

406
00:56:12,952 --> 00:56:16,753
Ashdown, come in! Ashdown, Connor.
Ashdown, Con... Damn him!

407
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:18,202
- Blair.
- What?

408
00:57:22,054 --> 00:57:24,840
This is us.
The mines are magnetic.

409
00:57:24,840 --> 00:57:27,552
If we head due west
at this point of entry, we're good.

410
00:57:30,956 --> 00:57:32,175
I'll go first.

411
00:58:01,682 --> 00:58:03,570
Let's go, Marcus.
I'm starving.

412
00:58:22,559 --> 00:58:26,824
<i>This is the beginning</i>
of something wonderful.

413
00:58:26,858 --> 00:58:29,583
The son of a bitch is here.

414
00:58:29,985 --> 00:58:32,235
What do we've got here?
He stepped on a landmine.

415
00:58:32,237 --> 00:58:35,929
- Start a large four IV. Keep it open.
- Patient needs more morphine.

416
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,614
- What's his name?
- Marcus.

417
00:58:41,621 --> 00:58:43,371
- He's got a prosthetic limb?
- What?

418
00:58:45,123 --> 00:58:47,626
Okay, pulse is dead.
Let's see what we've got here.

419
00:58:53,597 --> 00:58:54,865
Barnes...

420
00:59:01,067 --> 00:59:03,643
The Devil's hands
have been busy.

421
00:59:05,449 --> 00:59:08,505
- What is it?
- It's real flesh and blood.

422
00:59:08,507 --> 00:59:10,259
Though it seems
to heal his off quickly.

423
00:59:10,260 --> 00:59:15,130
The heart is human,
but very powerful.

424
00:59:15,130 --> 00:59:17,943
The brain too,
but with a chip interface.

425
00:59:17,945 --> 00:59:20,704
It has a hybrid nervous system.

426
00:59:20,706 --> 00:59:23,242
One human cortex. ...

427
00:59:23,242 --> 00:59:26,280
- One machine.
- What the hell would have they done?

428
00:59:27,701 --> 00:59:29,088
Who built you?

429
00:59:30,351 --> 00:59:34,304
My name is
Marcus Wright.

430
00:59:34,304 --> 00:59:36,233
You think
you're human?

431
00:59:36,233 --> 00:59:38,134
I am human.

432
01:00:05,717 --> 01:00:07,135
No!

433
01:00:13,014 --> 01:00:14,992
Where were you
manufactured?

434
01:00:15,027 --> 01:00:20,969
I was born...
August 22nd, 1975.

435
01:00:33,126 --> 01:00:34,681
I know you.

436
01:00:35,806 --> 01:00:37,947
I heard your voice
on the radio.

437
01:00:37,949 --> 01:00:45,677
- You're John Connor.
- Of course you know me. You were sent here to kill me.

438
01:00:45,677 --> 01:00:48,297
Kill the leadership.

439
01:00:48,331 --> 01:00:50,211
I don't know
what you're talking about.

440
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:51,844
Then why are you here?

441
01:00:51,844 --> 01:00:53,976
Blair said you could help me
find who I'm looking for.

442
01:00:58,458 --> 01:01:00,164
Now let me down.

443
01:01:00,164 --> 01:01:04,565
If I let you down...
you'll kill everyone in this room.

444
01:01:05,458 --> 01:01:07,512
Just you, Connor.

445
01:01:07,547 --> 01:01:09,789
'Cause I ain't
give a shit about you.

446
01:01:09,824 --> 01:01:12,447
I didn't even know your name
until two days ago.

447
01:01:12,447 --> 01:01:13,318
No?

448
01:01:17,708 --> 01:01:21,427
You and me...
We've been at war,

449
01:01:22,538 --> 01:01:24,858
since before
either of us even existed.

450
01:01:26,844 --> 01:01:29,925
You tried killing my mother,
Sarah Connor.

451
01:01:31,184 --> 01:01:34,275
You killed my father,
Kyle Reese.

452
01:01:34,311 --> 01:01:37,923
You will not
kill me.

453
01:01:37,925 --> 01:01:44,588
Kyle Reese is on a transporter,
heading to Skynet.

454
01:01:45,768 --> 01:01:47,347
If I wanted
to kill him,

455
01:01:47,347 --> 01:01:50,726
I would have done it
in L.A.

456
01:01:57,090 --> 01:01:58,469
Where did you
find that thing?

457
01:01:58,469 --> 01:02:01,398
You sent Mariah and me
to provide cover for some civilians.

458
01:02:01,398 --> 01:02:02,425
He was
one of them.

459
01:02:02,425 --> 01:02:04,380
Was there
a teenage boy?

460
01:02:05,442 --> 01:02:07,873
I honestly don't know.
They were taking him to a transport.

461
01:02:07,873 --> 01:02:11,798
- He was the only one left.
- Not he, Blair. It.

462
01:02:11,833 --> 01:02:13,771
<i>It</i> was the only one left.
Don't be naďve.

463
01:02:15,009 --> 01:02:16,501
It saved my life.

464
01:02:19,898 --> 01:02:21,574
Kate, what's gonna
happen to him?

465
01:02:23,030 --> 01:02:24,670
Disassembled.

466
01:02:24,670 --> 01:02:26,197
You mean killed?

467
01:02:26,199 --> 01:02:28,675
It may have information
on Skynet.

468
01:02:31,061 --> 01:02:32,675
I know
he's not the enemy.

469
01:02:32,675 --> 01:02:35,447
I've been shot at by the enemy.
That's not him.

470
01:02:35,447 --> 01:02:39,561
That machine saved you only
to gain access to kill all of us.

471
01:03:20,831 --> 01:03:22,465
We're gonna be okay.
Don't worry.

472
01:03:40,135 --> 01:03:41,447
For my brother.

473
01:04:00,913 --> 01:04:02,322
Connor wants
to see you.

474
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:04,309
What for?

475
01:04:04,976 --> 01:04:06,963
Like he's going to tell me,
Barnes.

476
01:04:09,152 --> 01:04:11,382
Let me see that.

477
01:04:18,150 --> 01:04:20,384
- You want me to tell Connor you're not coming?
- No.

478
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:27,150
Watch him.

479
01:04:55,210 --> 01:04:57,018
<i>I told you everything
I know, John.</i>

480
01:04:57,018 --> 01:05:00,322
<i>Skynet is ruthless
and unpredictable.</i>

481
01:05:00,322 --> 01:05:03,815
<i>They will use the best part of you
against yourself,</i>

482
01:05:03,815 --> 01:05:07,657
<i>and they will have methods
I can't imagine or predict.</i>

483
01:05:07,657 --> 01:05:09,942
<i>That I can't
help you with.</i>

484
01:05:09,976 --> 01:05:15,563
<i>And when you're unsure,
which just always follow your heart, John.</i>

485
01:05:15,599 --> 01:05:18,204
<i>I love you.
Goodbye.</i>

486
01:05:21,146 --> 01:05:23,811
There's nothing on the tapes
about machines with organs.

487
01:05:23,847 --> 01:05:25,086
That thing in there...

488
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:30,362
I thought I knew
our enemy.

489
01:05:30,398 --> 01:05:31,614
But that thing...

490
01:05:31,614 --> 01:05:34,014
That makes me feel like
I know nothing.

491
01:05:36,438 --> 01:05:38,858
I looked in its eyes,
and it believes,

492
01:05:38,858 --> 01:05:41,677
absolutely believes,
that it is human.

493
01:05:41,677 --> 01:05:45,307
It believes in everything
that it says,

494
01:05:45,342 --> 01:05:50,018
and it is telling me
that Kyle Reese is in Skynet.

495
01:05:51,773 --> 01:05:52,869
If that is true...

496
01:05:52,869 --> 01:05:58,014
The Command is about to bomb my
father and the rest of those prisoners

497
01:05:58,014 --> 01:06:01,340
and I cannot stop them.

498
01:06:08,778 --> 01:06:10,065
Thank you.

499
01:06:10,972 --> 01:06:12,016
Come in!

500
01:06:14,782 --> 01:06:16,717
Barnes.
What about Blair?

501
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:54,436
- She made her choice.
- Get down!

502
01:07:07,329 --> 01:07:08,771
Let's move.

503
01:07:21,751 --> 01:07:23,237
- Put a light out there.
- We're back in the minefield.

504
01:07:23,239 --> 01:07:24,673
I have a plan.

505
01:07:48,407 --> 01:07:50,423
- Blair, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay!

506
01:07:50,460 --> 01:07:52,677
- Get your team back!
- There they are!

507
01:07:54,351 --> 01:07:55,079
Run! God!

508
01:08:06,829 --> 01:08:07,969
Now what?

509
01:08:09,106 --> 01:08:10,646
M-My plan stopped
at the jeep.

510
01:08:21,689 --> 01:08:24,287
I'll draw the fire.
You take out the light.

511
01:08:43,552 --> 01:08:45,938
Keep your head down!
Go, go, go, go!

512
01:08:55,056 --> 01:08:56,039
Come on!

513
01:09:01,355 --> 01:09:03,543
- You alright?
- Let's get you out of here.

514
01:09:09,962 --> 01:09:10,949
There they are!

515
01:10:22,466 --> 01:10:25,930
<i>Alligator, this is Cockpit 5-1,
we have eyes on the machine.</i>

516
01:10:40,722 --> 01:10:42,490
Take my gun!

517
01:11:15,667 --> 01:11:17,265
<i>Check the river.</i>

518
01:11:33,033 --> 01:11:34,235
You see him?

519
01:12:01,537 --> 01:12:03,399
I'm going down!

520
01:12:11,528 --> 01:12:13,078
Fall!

521
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:17,347
Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!

522
01:13:05,993 --> 01:13:08,063
I know what you are,
even if you don't.

523
01:13:08,104 --> 01:13:08,997
Enough!

524
01:13:10,158 --> 01:13:11,623
That gun ain't
gonna stop shit!

525
01:13:11,625 --> 01:13:14,572
Nobody shot you in the heart, and I see
that thing beating a mile a minute.

526
01:13:14,573 --> 01:13:15,722
Kyle Reese...

527
01:13:15,724 --> 01:13:18,872
He's in Skynet.
You do that, he's dead.

528
01:13:20,648 --> 01:13:21,934
I can get you in.

529
01:13:23,801 --> 01:13:24,654
How?

530
01:13:31,454 --> 01:13:32,970
Look at me.

531
01:13:34,997 --> 01:13:37,073
That's why
I don't trust you.

532
01:13:38,975 --> 01:13:41,146
I'm your only hope
you have.

533
01:13:45,051 --> 01:13:47,485
I need to find
who did this to me.

534
01:13:48,974 --> 01:13:50,315
So do you.

535
01:13:59,666 --> 01:14:01,402
Make your choice.

536
01:14:02,871 --> 01:14:04,967
You kept being...

537
01:14:07,056 --> 01:14:11,115
You tell me
where I can find Kyle Reese.

538
01:14:13,332 --> 01:14:16,990
- Yeah?
- I will.

539
01:14:22,685 --> 01:14:23,713
Contact me on that.

540
01:14:25,060 --> 01:14:26,893
Let me know
he's still alive.

541
01:14:33,106 --> 01:14:35,917
- What are you?
- I don't know.

542
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:45,684
Hey,
he's over here.

543
01:14:50,556 --> 01:14:52,871
You alright?
Any sign of him?

544
01:14:54,208 --> 01:14:55,592
He's gone.

545
01:15:03,438 --> 01:15:04,840
What'd you do?

546
01:15:06,243 --> 01:15:09,436
How's your leg?

547
01:15:18,484 --> 01:15:19,886
I'll live.

548
01:15:19,886 --> 01:15:22,712
Let me go!

549
01:15:32,586 --> 01:15:34,939
Connor.
Command for you.

550
01:15:34,939 --> 01:15:39,100
- This is Connor.
- Connor,are your men ready?

551
01:15:39,100 --> 01:15:41,592
<i>Negative.
Nobody is ready.</i>

552
01:15:41,594 --> 01:15:43,020
We are not,
you are not.

553
01:15:43,021 --> 01:15:46,067
We must abort the attack.
The game has changed.

554
01:15:46,068 --> 01:15:49,703
What are you talking about?
All our elements are past the release point.

555
01:15:49,703 --> 01:15:51,536
They are in assault position!

556
01:15:51,537 --> 01:15:55,100
Then delay the attack.
At least, delay the attack.

557
01:15:55,100 --> 01:15:58,136
I have a chance to infiltrate Skynet
and rescue those prisoners.

558
01:15:58,137 --> 01:15:59,541
Give me
that opportunity.

559
01:15:59,542 --> 01:16:01,065
No, absolutely not!

560
01:16:01,067 --> 01:16:02,939
This is not the time
for a rescue mission!

561
01:16:02,939 --> 01:16:05,956
What you ask for will
undermine the whole operation.

562
01:16:05,957 --> 01:16:08,453
Skynet has Kyle Reese.

563
01:16:08,453 --> 01:16:10,765
And that is his fate.

564
01:16:10,766 --> 01:16:12,690
<i>No, it's our fate.</i>
I have to save him.

565
01:16:12,692 --> 01:16:14,872
He is the key!

566
01:16:15,296 --> 01:16:17,039
The key to the future,
to the past.

567
01:16:17,041 --> 01:16:20,152
Without him,
we lose everything.

568
01:16:20,153 --> 01:16:21,829
No!
You stay the course!

569
01:16:21,831 --> 01:16:27,007
If we stay the course, we are dead!
We are all dead!

570
01:16:27,009 --> 01:16:29,386
<i>As of this moment,
soldier,</i>

571
01:16:29,387 --> 01:16:31,356
you are relieved
to your command.

572
01:16:31,358 --> 01:16:34,331
You are no longer
a part of this Resistance!

573
01:16:44,326 --> 01:16:45,813
I didn't catch
that last statement.

574
01:16:49,695 --> 01:16:51,694
This is John Connor.
If you're listening to this...

575
01:16:51,694 --> 01:16:53,875
you are
the Resistance.

576
01:16:55,177 --> 01:16:58,465
<i>Listen carefully.
If we attack tonight,</i>

577
01:16:58,876 --> 01:17:00,891
<i>our humanity is lost.</i>

578
01:17:02,118 --> 01:17:03,972
Command wants us
to fight like machines,

579
01:17:03,974 --> 01:17:06,630
they want us to make
cold, calculated decisions.

580
01:17:06,631 --> 01:17:08,820
But we are not
machines.

581
01:17:08,822 --> 01:17:14,277
And if we behave like them,
then what is the point... in winning?

582
01:17:14,278 --> 01:17:18,916
<i>Command is going to ask you
to attack Skynet.</i>

583
01:17:18,917 --> 01:17:21,908
<i>I am asking you
not to.</i>

584
01:17:25,176 --> 01:17:29,354
If even one bomb
drops on Skynet before sunrise,

585
01:17:29,354 --> 01:17:32,597
our future will be lost.

586
01:17:32,599 --> 01:17:35,966
<i>So, please. Stand down.
Give me the time</i>

587
01:17:35,967 --> 01:17:43,234
<i>to protect our future,
that all of us are fighting for.</i>

588
01:17:45,483 --> 01:17:47,030
This is
John Connor.

589
01:18:11,534 --> 01:18:14,831
What should I tell your men
when they find out you're gone?

590
01:18:18,364 --> 01:18:20,184
I'll be back.

591
01:20:13,721 --> 01:20:15,203
I'm coming for you.

592
01:21:00,878 --> 01:21:02,679
Come on, Marcus.

593
01:22:14,203 --> 01:22:15,618
Okay.

594
01:23:52,371 --> 01:23:55,051
Signal broadcasted
with full thrift, sir.

595
01:23:55,086 --> 01:23:56,153
Good.

596
01:23:56,154 --> 01:23:59,890
We have a green light
for the attack.

597
01:23:59,891 --> 01:24:01,404
<i>This is Bakersfield.</i>

598
01:24:01,404 --> 01:24:03,412
<i>That's a no-go
on your last. Out.</i>

599
01:24:03,412 --> 01:24:06,112
<i>Standing down. This is Reno.
Negative on your last.</i>

600
01:24:06,113 --> 01:24:09,038
Eugene, Reno, Bakersfield,
they're all standing down.

601
01:24:09,073 --> 01:24:10,266
They will not attack.

602
01:24:10,268 --> 01:24:12,296
Unless Connor gives the order.

603
01:24:40,631 --> 01:24:43,426
Kyle Reese?
Get to your transport!

604
01:24:43,426 --> 01:24:46,130
Is Kyle Reese here?

605
01:25:06,359 --> 01:25:09,756
<i>Welcome home, Marcus.
We knew you'd be back.</i>

606
01:25:10,680 --> 01:25:13,301
<i>After all,
it was programmed in you.</i>

607
01:25:14,841 --> 01:25:18,743
<i>Oh, and you executed
that programming beautifully.</i>

608
01:25:18,744 --> 01:25:20,338
What am I?

609
01:25:20,340 --> 01:25:23,056
You are
an infiltration prototype.

610
01:25:23,057 --> 01:25:24,944
The only
one of your kind.

611
01:25:24,945 --> 01:25:26,541
We resurrected you.

612
01:25:26,542 --> 01:25:30,550
<i>Advanced CyberDyne's work...
amended it.</i>

613
01:25:30,551 --> 01:25:31,841
what is it?

614
01:25:31,841 --> 01:25:36,127
<i>Calculations confirmed the serene code
on this face isn't easiest for you to process.</i>

615
01:25:36,128 --> 01:25:39,239
<i>It can be others
if you wish.</i>

616
01:25:39,240 --> 01:25:45,810
<i>Marcus, what else could you be...
if not machine?</i>

617
01:25:45,845 --> 01:25:47,707
A man.

618
01:25:47,708 --> 01:25:50,497
<i>The human condition
no longer applies to you.</i>

619
01:25:51,398 --> 01:25:53,511
<i>Accept what you
already know...</i>

620
01:25:53,512 --> 01:25:56,550
<i>That you were made
to serve a purpose.</i>

621
01:25:56,551 --> 01:26:00,041
<i>To achieve what no another
machine has achieved before.</i>

622
01:26:02,051 --> 01:26:07,435
<i>To infiltrate,find a target,and then
bring that target back home to us.</i>

623
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:13,905
<i>We've been at war since before
either of us even existed.</i>

624
01:26:13,907 --> 01:26:18,136
<i>You tried killing my mother,
Sarah Connor.</i>

625
01:26:18,136 --> 01:26:23,555
<i>You kill me...You tell me
where I can find Kyle Reese.</i>

626
01:26:23,556 --> 01:26:26,568
<i>Yeah, I will.</i>

627
01:26:34,529 --> 01:26:38,087
Kyle Reese!

628
01:26:46,650 --> 01:26:48,439
You, move!

629
01:26:48,439 --> 01:26:52,560
<i>In times of desperation, people will
believe what they want to believe.</i>

630
01:26:52,561 --> 01:26:57,300
<i>And so, we gave them
what they wanted to believe.</i>

631
01:26:57,301 --> 01:27:03,670
<i>A trick, in the form of a signal,
the Resistance thought would win the war.</i>

632
01:27:03,671 --> 01:27:09,636
<i>And they were right.
It will end this war.</i>

633
01:27:17,534 --> 01:27:19,418
Put the attack to
Skynet's Central back online.

634
01:27:19,420 --> 01:27:22,242
I want our aircraft in the skies,
immediately!

635
01:27:22,243 --> 01:27:26,833
Sir, sir, we got a bogey with a very large
radar signature closing in on our position.

636
01:27:38,213 --> 01:27:40,557
The signal?

637
01:27:45,342 --> 01:27:47,721
We have destroyed
ourselves.

638
01:27:47,722 --> 01:27:51,930
Skynet tracked our signal.
We led them straight to us.

639
01:28:05,233 --> 01:28:14,948
<i>Our best machines have failed,
time and again, to complete the mission.</i>

640
01:28:14,949 --> 01:28:18,180
<i>So we made you. We created
the perfect infiltration machine.</i>

641
01:28:18,180 --> 01:28:20,573
<i>You, Marcus.</i>

642
01:28:20,574 --> 01:28:24,564
<i>You did what Skynet
has failed to do for so many years.</i>

643
01:28:24,565 --> 01:28:27,706
<i>You killed John Connor.</i>

644
01:29:41,502 --> 01:29:43,408
<i>Don't fight, Marcus.</i>

645
01:29:44,108 --> 01:29:45,525
<i>Remember
what you are.</i>

646
01:29:46,819 --> 01:29:48,324
I know what I am.

647
01:30:00,533 --> 01:30:03,417
I'm better this way.

648
01:30:03,418 --> 01:30:05,436
You will not be given
a second chance.

649
01:30:06,488 --> 01:30:08,492
<i>You cannot save
John Connor.</i>

650
01:30:08,493 --> 01:30:10,595
Watch me.

651
01:30:39,613 --> 01:30:41,957
We got a message
from Connor!

652
01:30:41,957 --> 01:30:44,265
He's in Skynet.
Needs air support.

653
01:30:47,204 --> 01:30:49,180
Let's go!
Scram for the aircraft.

654
01:30:53,163 --> 01:30:55,016
Stop!
Stop, no!

655
01:31:07,378 --> 01:31:09,323
Come on!

656
01:31:29,952 --> 01:31:32,362
- What's your name?
- Kyle Reese.

657
01:31:38,510 --> 01:31:39,720
Stay with me!

658
01:32:00,381 --> 01:32:01,444
Back!

659
01:32:16,671 --> 01:32:18,484
Come on, Star,
move!

660
01:32:45,868 --> 01:32:50,730
- T-800s.
- There's so many of them.

661
01:33:10,748 --> 01:33:11,922
Be careful!

662
01:33:15,261 --> 01:33:17,078
What are these?

663
01:33:17,079 --> 01:33:20,798
Fuel cells.
Life source for the T-800.

664
01:33:24,186 --> 01:33:25,574
Nuclear.

665
01:33:25,576 --> 01:33:33,386
Enough to level this place.
Cover us.

666
01:33:39,310 --> 01:33:40,649
You ready?

667
01:34:04,139 --> 01:34:08,109
Run!Come on,
come on! Let's go!

668
01:34:10,606 --> 01:34:11,762
Come here!

669
01:34:15,114 --> 01:34:16,240
Come on!

670
01:34:20,287 --> 01:34:22,137
We got to get
to the transport!

671
01:34:28,025 --> 01:34:29,889
- Where are you going?
- I gotta end this.

672
01:34:29,890 --> 01:34:31,443
I'm not gonna
leave you!

673
01:34:31,444 --> 01:34:33,136
You didn't!

674
01:34:33,137 --> 01:34:34,469
Who are you?

675
01:34:34,470 --> 01:34:36,912
John Connor!

676
01:37:40,845 --> 01:37:42,105
Hey, John Connor's
in there.

677
01:37:42,106 --> 01:37:45,003
- Where?
- You show me there.

678
01:37:45,005 --> 01:37:47,448
John Connor's in there!

679
01:38:13,761 --> 01:38:15,418
Come with me!
Connor!

680
01:38:15,420 --> 01:38:17,154
Help!

681
01:38:19,310 --> 01:38:21,159
Connor, it's Kyle!
Help!

682
01:39:20,462 --> 01:39:23,132
You son of a bitch!

683
01:39:51,997 --> 01:39:53,519
Come on!

684
01:39:58,158 --> 01:39:59,622
Come on!

685
01:40:18,797 --> 01:40:20,207
Come on!

686
01:41:10,680 --> 01:41:12,070
Let's get out of here.

687
01:41:29,938 --> 01:41:31,783
John...

688
01:41:37,109 --> 01:41:40,243
We can't make it back to base.
Center's down and they never say so.

689
01:43:12,637 --> 01:43:14,282
How long?

690
01:43:18,086 --> 01:43:23,167
