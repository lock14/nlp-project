1
00:00:10,461 --> 00:00:14,589
Roadside bombs have claimed
the lives of eight US soldiers in Iraq.

2
00:00:14,674 --> 00:00:19,170
Four troops were killed when an explosion
struck their vehicle north of Baghdad,

3
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:22,547
while an airman was killed
by another roadside bomb in Tikrit.

4
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,881
Two soldiers were killed
and three wounded

5
00:00:24,975 --> 00:00:28,426
when their unit was struck
by a roadside bomb in Baghdad.

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,394
The death of an eighth soldier

7
00:00:30,481 --> 00:00:33,814
from a non-battle-related cause
is under investigation.

8
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,527
At least 3,555 members
of the US military have died

9
00:00:38,613 --> 00:00:41,899
since the Iraq War started
back in 2003.

10
00:01:50,974 --> 00:01:54,059
Washington DC
10:00am Eastern Standard Time

11
00:01:54,144 --> 00:01:56,267
Senator Jasper Irving's Office

12
00:01:56,355 --> 00:02:00,399
One more. That's it.
Thank you very much. Here's my card.

13
00:02:00,483 --> 00:02:03,769
- Thank you for coming in.
- Thank you, sir.

14
00:02:04,571 --> 00:02:06,397
Senator?

15
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:08,529
Absolutely.

16
00:02:08,616 --> 00:02:11,653
He's ready for you now, Ms Roth.

17
00:02:11,744 --> 00:02:13,653
- Sorry?
- The senator.

18
00:02:18,292 --> 00:02:20,285
OK.

19
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:25,923
- Ah, good morning, Janine.
- Hi.

20
00:02:26,008 --> 00:02:29,591
Only good thing about morning
is it ends at noon.

21
00:02:29,678 --> 00:02:32,881
Please, sit down.
Would you like some coffee, tea, water?

22
00:02:32,973 --> 00:02:35,345
- No, thanks.
- It's terrific to see you.

23
00:02:35,434 --> 00:02:37,260
- Thank you.
- Thanks for coming in.

24
00:02:37,352 --> 00:02:40,057
- Senator?
- Marcia, could I have coffee?

25
00:02:40,147 --> 00:02:43,895
I read the story you did
on the rise of image consultants in politics.

26
00:02:43,984 --> 00:02:47,435
- You did?
- I thought it was a good story, actually.

27
00:02:47,529 --> 00:02:49,568
It was a different angle.

28
00:02:50,615 --> 00:02:52,442
Thank you.

29
00:02:54,327 --> 00:02:56,699
Are we waiting for your PR pit bull or...?

30
00:02:56,787 --> 00:03:00,619
No. Just you and me.
No one to intercept your trick questions.

31
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,950
One-on-one time. Wow.

32
00:03:03,043 --> 00:03:06,744
You first called me the future of my party.
I'm returning the favour.

33
00:03:06,839 --> 00:03:11,132
- It was just how I saw it eight years ago.
- Well, nonetheless, grateful.

34
00:03:11,218 --> 00:03:16,508
Considering the state of your party,
how do you know the tag isn't pejorative?

35
00:03:16,598 --> 00:03:20,975
- Cos I got 77% of the vote.
- Oh, yeah. How could I forget?

36
00:03:21,061 --> 00:03:25,723
- Yes.
- You're aware I'm doing this time line...?

37
00:03:25,815 --> 00:03:29,184
Yeah, you're doing a detailed time line
on the war on terror.

38
00:03:29,277 --> 00:03:32,527
If it's like every other time line
that's come out this year

39
00:03:32,613 --> 00:03:37,489
it'll be the opening salvo of a much larger
retrospective of mistakes made.

40
00:03:37,577 --> 00:03:42,119
- Or it could just be a simple list of facts.
- From which you all will pick and choose.

41
00:03:42,206 --> 00:03:44,697
- You don't trust us.
- I trust you.

42
00:03:44,792 --> 00:03:48,576
- And that's why we're here.
- To discuss what, exactly?

43
00:03:48,671 --> 00:03:53,913
To see if you'd like to write an honest-to-God
story again, instead of reminding

44
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:58,007
the few paying attention that we've been
fighting a tough war for six years.

45
00:03:58,096 --> 00:04:00,552
Who gets the Peabody for that?

46
00:04:02,642 --> 00:04:04,101
What's the story?

47
00:04:04,185 --> 00:04:08,894
It's about a new plan
going into motion in Afghanistan.

48
00:04:08,982 --> 00:04:10,891
Afghanistan? A new plan?

49
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:15,396
A new plan that will win both the war
and, as cliché as this might sound,

50
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:18,572
the hearts and minds of the people.

51
00:04:19,659 --> 00:04:22,695
- What is it?
- I won't be at liberty to tell you everything.

52
00:04:22,787 --> 00:04:25,906
- National security.
- But enough so you might write a story

53
00:04:25,998 --> 00:04:29,283
about what we're doing
in Afghanistan now -

54
00:04:29,376 --> 00:04:31,285
not six years ago, but now -

55
00:04:31,378 --> 00:04:35,506
and how those efforts
can culminate into actual victory.

56
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:37,916
- What is this?
- "This"?

57
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:40,462
This meeting.

58
00:04:40,554 --> 00:04:45,548
This is my honest effort
to keep the press better informed

59
00:04:46,726 --> 00:04:49,810
and to change the subject
from the past to the future,

60
00:04:49,896 --> 00:04:54,973
acknowledge mistakes
and talk openly about ways of fixing them,

61
00:04:55,068 --> 00:04:57,855
step by step.

62
00:04:57,945 --> 00:05:00,317
How much time do we have together?

63
00:05:00,406 --> 00:05:02,233
I have till 11.

64
00:05:02,325 --> 00:05:06,820
The whole hour? Wow.
You all must be panicked.

65
00:05:06,912 --> 00:05:10,447
Oh, no, no, no, no. We're determined.

66
00:05:13,877 --> 00:05:17,127
Afghanistan
6:30pm Afghan Standard Time

67
00:05:18,423 --> 00:05:20,795
Bagram Air Force Base

68
00:05:28,933 --> 00:05:30,641
Listen up.

69
00:05:30,727 --> 00:05:33,396
- Finch, you and your boys good?
- Roger that, sir.

70
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:35,805
- How's that knee?
- Ready for that hike.

71
00:05:35,898 --> 00:05:38,389
- Glad to hear it. Rodriguez?
- All up, sir.

72
00:05:38,484 --> 00:05:43,027
All right. Good. I want you to take notes,
I want you to ask questions. Good news first.

73
00:05:43,114 --> 00:05:46,897
Al-Qaeda and the Taliban have been
whittled down to small wolf packs.

74
00:05:46,992 --> 00:05:49,199
Do not believe
everything in the papers.

75
00:05:49,286 --> 00:05:52,287
We've pounded the enemy
into something much smaller

76
00:05:52,373 --> 00:05:55,457
and more impotent than when
we first got here. That's good.

77
00:05:55,542 --> 00:05:59,622
The bad news. We have yet to step
on their throats. We've yet to close.

78
00:05:59,713 --> 00:06:04,173
The longer we don't, the harder it gets.
Remember your Von Clausewitz.

79
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:07,842
Never engage the same enemy
for too long or he will...

80
00:06:07,929 --> 00:06:10,930
- Adapt to your tactics.
- He will adapt to your tactics.

81
00:06:11,015 --> 00:06:15,761
That is correct. Case in point,
INTSUM is reporting

82
00:06:15,853 --> 00:06:19,981
that al-Qaeda in the Badakhshan province
is attempting to open up a new front.

83
00:06:20,066 --> 00:06:22,639
- Locals can't handle the fight?
- That's the problem.

84
00:06:22,735 --> 00:06:25,570
Nobody up there is strong enough
to fight this enemy

85
00:06:25,654 --> 00:06:28,821
and Karzai sure ain't gonna let
any of these guys go home now.

86
00:06:28,908 --> 00:06:30,651
Why is the enemy doing this now?

87
00:06:30,743 --> 00:06:36,413
Enemy is bent on establishing themselves
as a legitimate fighting force for the people.

88
00:06:36,498 --> 00:06:38,787
Sir, where are these guys comin' from?

89
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:41,627
They're asking families
to give up their sons.

90
00:06:41,711 --> 00:06:46,254
If they don't, the sons are executed
in front of the families. That's number one.

91
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:51,168
Number two is Iraq. Qaeda and the Tali
are starting to funnel battle-tested fighters...

92
00:06:51,262 --> 00:06:55,723
- Funnel through where, though, sir?
- I can't tell you. I ain't gonna answer that.

93
00:06:55,808 --> 00:06:58,050
Cos you already know too much.

94
00:06:59,645 --> 00:07:03,690
So jihadi and Wahhabi terrorists
are moving through Shiite territory, sir?

95
00:07:03,774 --> 00:07:07,606
Suffice it to say the enemy
is getting stronger and uglier.

96
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:11,988
It is time for us to get back into their kitchen,
put our foot on their throats.

97
00:07:12,074 --> 00:07:15,573
You are going to air-assault
into the Badakhshan province.

98
00:07:15,661 --> 00:07:19,907
You will set up an operating camp
at Pamela Left, the forward operating point,

99
00:07:19,998 --> 00:07:24,375
an 8,000ft peak offering
360° views of the valley below.

100
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:27,165
The enemy is gonna want it
just as badly as we do

101
00:07:27,255 --> 00:07:30,920
so we've been ordered to take it first
before the snow thaws.

102
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:33,963
Check your maps.
There's a suitable LZ. You all got that?

103
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:37,220
- Roger that, sir.
- You'll set up camp. You'll set up comms.

104
00:07:37,306 --> 00:07:41,885
You'll set up sat links. You will wait
and, if fortunate enough to engage the enemy,

105
00:07:41,978 --> 00:07:46,521
you will introduce them to the full measure
of America Mean. Clear?

106
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:49,770
Dress warm.

107
00:07:54,406 --> 00:07:58,404
We're being pushed awfully fast here,
aren't we, sir?

108
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:05,787
A California University
7:00am Pacific Standard Time

109
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,007
Professor Stephen Malley's Office

110
00:08:25,102 --> 00:08:26,894
Yep?

111
00:08:28,105 --> 00:08:29,730
- Morning.
- Morning.

112
00:08:29,815 --> 00:08:32,484
You want it closed or...?

113
00:08:32,568 --> 00:08:34,774
What's your guess, Todd?

114
00:08:38,407 --> 00:08:40,862
This is unethical,
making me bring you coffee.

115
00:08:40,951 --> 00:08:43,952
- No more than makin' me look at that shirt.
- Ho, ho, Doc.

116
00:08:44,037 --> 00:08:47,488
This here's a genuine Reyn Spooner.
This was 89.99. Or was it 69?

117
00:08:47,582 --> 00:08:51,662
- Oh, yeah? Well, I take it all back, then.
- Yeah, please.

118
00:08:51,753 --> 00:08:55,453
So, why'd I ask you to come in
this early with a gift?

119
00:08:55,548 --> 00:08:59,297
Well, you know,
my sporadic absences.

120
00:08:59,385 --> 00:09:03,086
Sounds like the title of a book
about your semester so far, doesn't it?

121
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,173
That's good, yeah.

122
00:09:06,225 --> 00:09:08,798
Yeah... I don't know, Doc.

123
00:09:08,894 --> 00:09:12,228
I just... I've never ever been
this busy in my life.

124
00:09:12,314 --> 00:09:16,561
- What with?
- Well, just, like, all my other classes.

125
00:09:16,652 --> 00:09:20,234
- This is your major.
- And there's also a young lady, too.

126
00:09:20,322 --> 00:09:21,318
Yeah?

127
00:09:21,406 --> 00:09:26,317
Is this the one that you jockey to sit next to
when you do come to my class?

128
00:09:26,411 --> 00:09:28,569
No.

129
00:09:28,663 --> 00:09:31,699
- What else keeps you busy?
- President of my fraternity.

130
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,626
- Hey. Hail to the chief.
- Oh, come on, now.

131
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:37,996
You were in a house, right?
Gotta remember how busy it can get.

132
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:41,125
With the four-day weekends
and 30-minute study sessions.

133
00:09:41,217 --> 00:09:44,134
- That's not what I mean.
- You asked me what I remember.

134
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:49,676
You don't think school should be as social
as it is academic? Getting two educations?

135
00:09:49,767 --> 00:09:53,100
I think if you can't balance the two
you shouldn't be here.

136
00:09:53,187 --> 00:09:55,594
I also think most of the kids
that argue that

137
00:09:55,689 --> 00:10:01,193
are the guys with the 2.4s trying to justify
30 grand a year for all those Cs.

138
00:10:03,655 --> 00:10:05,648
OK, my friend.

139
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,575
You've aced a lot of the exams
you've shown up for,

140
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,447
but you've only been
to eight classes this semester.

141
00:10:11,538 --> 00:10:15,369
Now, that'd be a hall of fame run
if we only met once a week.

142
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:19,456
So attendance is part
of my grade all of a sudden?

143
00:10:22,465 --> 00:10:24,256
Hey, Todd.

144
00:10:25,384 --> 00:10:29,761
Would you take a solid B
for the rest of this semester?

145
00:10:29,847 --> 00:10:33,216
No plus, no minus,
just a straight blue-collar B?

146
00:10:34,768 --> 00:10:38,433
I'll get that to you.
Right here. Right now.

147
00:10:38,981 --> 00:10:41,139
It's no bullshit.

148
00:10:41,233 --> 00:10:44,566
- A B for what?
- For not coming to another class.

149
00:10:44,653 --> 00:10:47,274
For not writing or reading
one word I assign to you.

150
00:10:47,364 --> 00:10:52,987
For not signing up for any more of
my classes for the rest of your time here.

151
00:10:53,078 --> 00:10:55,117
A B for nothing, huh?

152
00:10:55,205 --> 00:11:00,828
- You nod yes and this meeting's over.
- Half the class would kill for that deal.

153
00:11:00,918 --> 00:11:05,379
- But I'm not meeting with any of them.
- I think I know what you're doing.

154
00:11:05,464 --> 00:11:09,628
There's another deal. Two parts.
Both non-negotiable. First part,

155
00:11:09,718 --> 00:11:13,502
you show up every day,
every class from here on out.

156
00:11:13,597 --> 00:11:18,508
And second, you let me tell you about
the last two kids I had that gave me hope.

157
00:11:18,602 --> 00:11:22,185
Maybe that'll explain
why I called you in this morning.

158
00:11:34,325 --> 00:11:38,323
We're just fluttering.
Base turn to follow.

159
00:11:58,682 --> 00:12:02,016
- You got the reaction time of a foetus.
- Whoa!

160
00:12:02,102 --> 00:12:04,723
- There we go.
- Friendly skies.

161
00:12:04,813 --> 00:12:07,351
How can you be more afraid
of clouds than bullets?

162
00:12:07,441 --> 00:12:10,110
Cos I'd rather take a bullet than a fall.

163
00:12:10,193 --> 00:12:12,316
You think you fast?

164
00:12:19,243 --> 00:12:23,407
This is a very high-minded goal
you've set for yourselves.

165
00:12:23,498 --> 00:12:26,415
But this goal for the future of Afghanistan

166
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:30,201
is just a lot of hot air
unless we solve the military problem first.

167
00:12:30,296 --> 00:12:33,546
Our Special Forces soldiers
are going to take the high ground

168
00:12:33,632 --> 00:12:38,009
in key positions throughout Afghanistan
before the snow thaws.

169
00:12:38,095 --> 00:12:41,012
And the military part
has to come first why?

170
00:12:41,098 --> 00:12:43,636
Because only after
we've eradicated the enemy

171
00:12:43,725 --> 00:12:47,770
can we then get down to the true work
of keeping this new democracy breathing.

172
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:51,768
- So it's basically kill people to help people.
- No. That's not what I said.

173
00:12:51,858 --> 00:12:54,527
I said "the enemy".
Don't take that out of context.

174
00:12:54,611 --> 00:12:57,149
Sorry. I was just trying to boil it down.

175
00:12:57,238 --> 00:12:59,646
In 2002, I remember
you said something like:

176
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:02,907
"The Taliban's back is forever broken",
then big applause.

177
00:13:02,994 --> 00:13:06,778
"Mission accomplished." Writ small.

178
00:13:06,872 --> 00:13:08,532
- Mistake.
- Mistake?

179
00:13:08,624 --> 00:13:11,958
Because we now know the enemy
with broken backs can still crawl

180
00:13:12,044 --> 00:13:16,207
and we know that the enemy learned
their lesson from that first backbreaking.

181
00:13:16,298 --> 00:13:20,082
So you're taking it for granted
there's gonna be a second backbreaking.

182
00:13:20,177 --> 00:13:22,549
Would we be having this meeting
if I didn't?

183
00:13:22,638 --> 00:13:25,093
Is this how the rest
of the hour's gonna go?

184
00:13:25,182 --> 00:13:28,882
I'm just asking questions.
Senator, can you just give me one example

185
00:13:28,977 --> 00:13:31,385
of the enemy having learned a lesson?

186
00:13:31,479 --> 00:13:35,097
They've woken up to the fact
that we're fighting on two fronts.

187
00:13:35,191 --> 00:13:38,192
And history does tend to punish
that kind of hubris.

188
00:13:38,278 --> 00:13:43,023
So we're launching this new strategy
using the military as the opening punch.

189
00:13:43,116 --> 00:13:45,737
Now, taking the high ground is key.

190
00:13:45,827 --> 00:13:49,077
Whoever takes it
owns the ability to observe,

191
00:13:49,163 --> 00:13:53,410
the prerogative to attack,
and the opportunity to preside.

192
00:13:53,501 --> 00:13:56,454
- So... preside?
- It's why the Romans built forts.

193
00:13:56,545 --> 00:13:59,831
Establish a constant presence
or you have constant violence.

194
00:13:59,923 --> 00:14:03,588
So we're gonna be there for good,
like Romans?

195
00:14:05,053 --> 00:14:07,924
I said "constant", not "permanent".

196
00:14:08,473 --> 00:14:13,633
We have to have the same determination
as these insurgents or they'll outlast us.

197
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:16,729
This security allows us to build
schools and clinics...

198
00:14:16,815 --> 00:14:20,230
- But where is NATO in all this?
- Good question. Where are they?

199
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:24,814
We can't wait for them to decide,
so we put this new strategy into motion now.

200
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:28,606
And why now? Why not a year ago?
Two years? Three years?

201
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:32,745
Two reasons. First reason,
the satellites and drones

202
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:35,784
are not nearly as omniscient
as they're marketed to be.

203
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,330
Anybody knows that.
You just Google "Predator".

204
00:14:38,419 --> 00:14:42,831
- The second reason's ugly.
- Ugly? Is that code for "off the record"?

205
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,962
For the time being, yeah.

206
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,671
OK.

207
00:14:49,346 --> 00:14:52,097
- Iran.
- Iran? What are they doing now?

208
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:55,385
Outside of building nuclear weapons,
talking to North Korea,

209
00:14:55,477 --> 00:14:59,688
and telling Israel they don't know
what a real holocaust looks like?

210
00:14:59,772 --> 00:15:03,817
They're allowing Wahhabi insurgents
to hike from Iraq to Afghanistan

211
00:15:03,901 --> 00:15:09,108
- using the most direct route possible.
- Across the countryside of Iran.

212
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:13,692
- Is that confirmed?
- By their denials.

213
00:15:13,786 --> 00:15:17,618
- Proof there truly is a new axis of evil.
- Oh, wow.

214
00:15:17,706 --> 00:15:21,953
1300 years of murder between the Sunnis
and Shiahs getting back-burnered now

215
00:15:22,044 --> 00:15:24,582
so they can kill more Americans
in more places.

216
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:28,716
Are we still off the record?
Because this really is... this is a story.

217
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,587
That's negotiable.
Do you see what I'm saying?

218
00:15:31,678 --> 00:15:34,632
These radicals are uniting against us.

219
00:15:34,723 --> 00:15:38,056
We need to remind the American people
who their enemies are.

220
00:15:38,143 --> 00:15:43,137
You have proof they are uniting against us,
or are you saying there may be potential...?

221
00:15:43,231 --> 00:15:46,600
Don't underestimate
how frightening a development this is.

222
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:52,316
This is a significant threat to the security
of our nation and you can quote me on this.

223
00:15:52,406 --> 00:15:55,857
Now that Iran has nuclear potential,
we simply cannot...

224
00:15:55,951 --> 00:15:59,735
When you say "nuclear", it sounds like
the same kind of fear-mongering...

225
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:04,077
Your position affords you the luxury
of that opinion. Mine does not.

226
00:16:04,168 --> 00:16:09,707
It is my responsibility, it's part of my job
description to protect the American people,

227
00:16:09,798 --> 00:16:13,630
and that is why we put
this new strategy into motion now.

228
00:16:13,718 --> 00:16:16,090
So when does it start?

229
00:16:17,806 --> 00:16:20,047
Ten minutes ago.

230
00:16:23,811 --> 00:16:26,349
Copy that. I'll let him know.

231
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:30,353
- Heads up.
- Sir, we're two minutes out.

232
00:16:30,443 --> 00:16:33,858
Two minutes! Lock and load!

233
00:16:53,798 --> 00:16:58,507
- That's an old AA right there.
- Anti-aircraft gun on the ridge.

234
00:17:03,850 --> 00:17:05,842
NODs!

235
00:17:08,729 --> 00:17:11,683
It's all good, sir.
Drones took pictures last night.

236
00:17:11,774 --> 00:17:16,068
It's an old rusty 23-millimetre
with spiked barrels.

237
00:17:16,153 --> 00:17:17,695
Good eye, though.

238
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,068
Rusted and spiked. Inoperable.

239
00:17:20,157 --> 00:17:23,111
Spiked. By whom?

240
00:17:23,202 --> 00:17:26,405
Point is, it can't shoot.

241
00:17:26,496 --> 00:17:27,777
What?

242
00:17:27,873 --> 00:17:31,870
An old AA gun that can't shoot
can make for a nasty trap.

243
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,421
Sir, I see this kind of junk from the air
all the time.

244
00:17:36,506 --> 00:17:39,175
That's why we call this place
"Trashghani..."

245
00:17:46,057 --> 00:17:47,931
Medic!

246
00:17:49,477 --> 00:17:52,596
What direction? What direction?

247
00:17:54,523 --> 00:17:57,726
We are taking fire. Mayday! Mayday!

248
00:18:00,362 --> 00:18:02,651
Give me your finger. Give me your finger.

249
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,898
Turn towards it. Turn towards it.

250
00:18:07,411 --> 00:18:09,984
Turn towards it.

251
00:18:20,632 --> 00:18:22,790
Land!

252
00:18:23,426 --> 00:18:25,584
Land! Land!

253
00:18:27,597 --> 00:18:28,972
Land!

254
00:18:50,952 --> 00:18:54,535
- What are their names again?
- Ernest and Arian.

255
00:18:54,623 --> 00:18:56,995
Wait. Like, master race - Aryan?

256
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:59,835
He spelt it with an i instead of a y.
What's your point?

257
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:02,161
- If you looked up "irony", huh?
- What?

258
00:19:02,255 --> 00:19:05,790
You know, a guy named Arian,
he could only be...

259
00:19:05,883 --> 00:19:07,164
African-American.

260
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,466
What difference does that make?

261
00:19:09,554 --> 00:19:11,630
Stay focused on the American part.

262
00:19:11,722 --> 00:19:14,842
All right. So they played ball, huh?

263
00:19:14,934 --> 00:19:17,507
It was the only way
they could afford to come here.

264
00:19:17,603 --> 00:19:22,810
Scholarship athletes. You wanna come up
with two guys more different than me?

265
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:26,314
What?

266
00:19:26,403 --> 00:19:29,357
You know, professors aren't teachers,
they're salesmen.

267
00:19:29,448 --> 00:19:31,571
OK. So what do you sell?

268
00:19:31,658 --> 00:19:33,069
You, to you.

269
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:36,575
But, you know, you don't...
you don't have to do me any favours, Doc.

270
00:19:36,663 --> 00:19:40,447
- And why is that, Todd?
- Why don't you have to do me favours?

271
00:19:40,542 --> 00:19:43,708
Why don't you care any more?

272
00:19:45,922 --> 00:19:48,460
I cared before
because I showed up to your class?

273
00:19:48,549 --> 00:19:52,167
Yeah.
You not only showed up, you got involved.

274
00:19:52,261 --> 00:19:56,590
You read everything I assigned. You were
hungry. You leaned into those lectures.

275
00:19:56,682 --> 00:20:00,133
You went for the jugular in every debate.
Why not any more?

276
00:20:00,227 --> 00:20:04,011
I already answered you.
A lot of things, girls...

277
00:20:04,106 --> 00:20:06,478
Bullshit. Come on.
Hey, Todd. Come on.

278
00:20:09,027 --> 00:20:11,316
Go on.

279
00:20:11,405 --> 00:20:13,397
I don't want to hurt your feelings.

280
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,656
Hey, we... we got an hour.

281
00:20:16,743 --> 00:20:20,954
Don't waste a second worrying about
my feelings. I'm not worrying about yours.

282
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,823
Thanks. You should write Hallmark cards.

283
00:20:24,918 --> 00:20:27,373
OK. Go on.

284
00:20:28,713 --> 00:20:31,548
- Say it.
- All right, all right.

285
00:20:33,634 --> 00:20:36,042
Political science, Doc.

286
00:20:37,930 --> 00:20:40,302
What's scientific
outside of the psychology

287
00:20:40,391 --> 00:20:45,099
behind how much shit
voters will swallow before they notice?

288
00:20:45,187 --> 00:20:48,390
The science part,
it's really only about how to win.

289
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:51,815
Not how to govern, not how to
make anybody better, just how to win.

290
00:20:51,902 --> 00:20:55,187
No matter how stupid
or two-faced or criminal you look.

291
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,403
Give me an example.

292
00:20:57,490 --> 00:21:00,195
OK. Like presidential candidates now.

293
00:21:00,285 --> 00:21:03,618
They announce their candidacy
by standing in front of an audience

294
00:21:03,705 --> 00:21:06,077
and saying they will not run for president.

295
00:21:06,165 --> 00:21:08,454
You know? Yeah.
What is that shit?

296
00:21:08,543 --> 00:21:11,497
- It's as old as time.
- No, I don't think so, cos...

297
00:21:11,587 --> 00:21:14,754
OK, you had me when we were
studying the old philosophers.

298
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:19,301
The Greeks... I mean, Doc, you... you had me.
They were awesome.

299
00:21:19,386 --> 00:21:23,716
But somewhere...
somewhere you lost me. I don't know.

300
00:21:23,807 --> 00:21:25,515
- Have you ever been to Greece?
- No.

301
00:21:25,601 --> 00:21:30,939
No, otherwise you'd know their government
makes ours look like a vision of the future.

302
00:21:31,023 --> 00:21:33,514
Well, isn't that my point?

303
00:21:33,608 --> 00:21:37,736
Socrates, Plato, Aristotle. If they can't
fix things, what is Todd Hayes gonna do?

304
00:21:37,821 --> 00:21:39,564
Bitch? Quit?

305
00:21:39,656 --> 00:21:42,776
I'm gonna pay my taxes.
I'm gonna obey traffic lights...

306
00:21:42,867 --> 00:21:46,735
That's super.
I was thinking about something bigger.

307
00:21:46,829 --> 00:21:50,957
Something bigger? Bigger like what?
Like, be a congressman bigger?

308
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:54,043
- Well, that's bigger.
- Oh, yeah. Super.

309
00:21:54,128 --> 00:21:55,871
I get to be one of those turds in DC -

310
00:21:55,963 --> 00:21:59,083
and I do mean pure pieces of shit -
who make our laws?

311
00:21:59,175 --> 00:22:02,211
I get to be a doughboy
who parts his hair like everyone else?

312
00:22:02,303 --> 00:22:05,422
The guy who never says anything
though he never stops talking.

313
00:22:05,514 --> 00:22:09,049
Do I get to be the guy
who lectures you on morality

314
00:22:09,142 --> 00:22:11,301
while a page
jacks me off under the table?

315
00:22:11,395 --> 00:22:13,683
Oh, yeah, please.

316
00:22:13,772 --> 00:22:18,149
The guy who funnels away a million and
bawls like an evangelist when he's caught.

317
00:22:18,235 --> 00:22:20,523
And how many never get caught, Doc?

318
00:22:20,612 --> 00:22:25,772
Hey, if that's something bigger than being
a good Joe with a good job, fuck it.

319
00:22:25,867 --> 00:22:28,618
Yeah, that's where you lost me.

320
00:22:33,833 --> 00:22:36,703
You almost convinced me.

321
00:22:38,546 --> 00:22:40,669
- Almost convinced me.
- What?

322
00:22:40,756 --> 00:22:43,757
That you really know
what you're talking about.

323
00:22:43,842 --> 00:22:45,835
You're great with words, Todd.

324
00:22:45,928 --> 00:22:48,763
But what would make 'em better
is if they had a heartbeat.

325
00:22:48,847 --> 00:22:51,883
If they were rooted
in any kind of experience,

326
00:22:51,975 --> 00:22:56,352
if you had knocked on doors, licked
envelopes, been to a damn public rally,

327
00:22:56,438 --> 00:22:58,514
just put yourself on the line in any way.

328
00:22:58,607 --> 00:23:01,477
Licking envelopes,
that's putting myself on the line?

329
00:23:01,568 --> 00:23:03,975
Infinitely more than just talking.

330
00:23:58,497 --> 00:23:59,908
Ernie.

331
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:07,624
Brother.

332
00:24:08,841 --> 00:24:10,999
Pamela Left is hot.

333
00:24:11,093 --> 00:24:14,378
- How hot?
- Chinook took hits from small arms, RPGs.

334
00:24:14,471 --> 00:24:17,555
They have dead and wounded,
and didn't land at the objective.

335
00:24:17,641 --> 00:24:20,428
- Where did they land?
- Three kilometres south.

336
00:24:20,518 --> 00:24:22,807
Chopper's fucked for good,
two men missing.

337
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:26,430
- Missing? Lead with that. Who's missing?
- Finch and Rodriguez.

338
00:24:26,524 --> 00:24:30,771
Consensus is that they fell out
over a small ridge short of the planned LZ.

339
00:24:30,862 --> 00:24:33,946
No guessing on
whether or not they survived.

340
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:48,292
Ernie.

341
00:24:50,214 --> 00:24:52,965
Brother.

342
00:24:55,135 --> 00:24:57,174
Arian!

343
00:24:58,096 --> 00:25:00,931
You fucking idiot.

344
00:25:01,016 --> 00:25:03,851
How bad are you?

345
00:25:09,357 --> 00:25:11,563
Bad! Can you get to me?

346
00:25:17,907 --> 00:25:21,323
I'm stuck. My leg's jammed.

347
00:25:22,912 --> 00:25:24,074
Hang on.

348
00:25:24,163 --> 00:25:25,705
I'll launch the rescue chopper.

349
00:25:25,789 --> 00:25:28,874
Vector 'em halfway
between Pamela Left and us.

350
00:25:28,959 --> 00:25:30,868
We won't put them in that gauntlet.

351
00:25:30,961 --> 00:25:34,661
Put them in a holding pattern until
we know what's going on. See anything?

352
00:25:34,756 --> 00:25:39,003
I don't know for how long. Cold front's still
coming. G2 says it's packing big snow...

353
00:25:39,094 --> 00:25:41,845
I want to see as much as I can
for as long as I can.

354
00:25:41,930 --> 00:25:44,088
- ETA on a fast mover?
- I got a Warthog

355
00:25:44,182 --> 00:25:47,765
that'll take 20-25 minutes to get out there,
but the margin of safe...

356
00:25:47,852 --> 00:25:48,848
Do it.

357
00:25:48,937 --> 00:25:52,804
I would love to talk to the motherfucker
that said this mountaintop was secure.

358
00:25:53,191 --> 00:25:58,267
Afghan terrain demands that small teams
establish forward operating points.

359
00:25:58,362 --> 00:26:02,739
I've heard of forward operating bases,
but not forward operating points.

360
00:26:02,825 --> 00:26:07,119
- "Point" sounds smaller than "base".
- Because it is.

361
00:26:07,204 --> 00:26:11,284
- What? Just, come on, say it.
- Sorry. No. I... I... I just...

362
00:26:11,375 --> 00:26:13,747
It also sounds like Pentagonese for "bait".

363
00:26:13,835 --> 00:26:18,793
Janine, it's not like we're putting
one or two guys on the mountain here.

364
00:26:18,882 --> 00:26:23,211
- All right. But small is how we fight now.
- Says the man in the air-conditioned room.

365
00:26:23,303 --> 00:26:24,927
This is the fight that we're in,

366
00:26:25,013 --> 00:26:29,675
and unfortunately civilisations do not
sustain themselves through non-violence.

367
00:26:29,767 --> 00:26:33,847
What does that mean? Are you going to
forgo diplomacy in the state department?

368
00:26:33,938 --> 00:26:35,812
We were attacked.

369
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:39,730
You do not respond to an attack
with diplomacy.

370
00:26:39,819 --> 00:26:43,437
Bin Laden's idea of diplomacy
is not filming the beheadings.

371
00:26:43,531 --> 00:26:46,697
Saddam violated 16 UN resolutions
and the UN responded

372
00:26:46,784 --> 00:26:50,283
by issuing 30-plus stern statements
condemning his behaviour.

373
00:26:50,370 --> 00:26:54,783
All the while, France, China and Russia
continued to trade with him under the table.

374
00:26:54,875 --> 00:26:57,117
And didn't we also
arm Saddam in the '80s?

375
00:26:57,210 --> 00:26:59,666
- But here we are now.
- Yes, here we are now.

376
00:26:59,754 --> 00:27:02,127
Don't you think it's critical to examine...?

377
00:27:02,215 --> 00:27:05,999
How and why is not the issue now.
We have to move forward.

378
00:27:06,094 --> 00:27:10,969
We're fighting a brand of evil that thinks
the last 1300 years of human progress

379
00:27:11,057 --> 00:27:13,762
is heresy punishable by violent death.

380
00:27:13,851 --> 00:27:16,638
Now, if you don't feel
that should be wiped from the...

381
00:27:16,729 --> 00:27:19,564
I'd like to see Bin Laden
dead and gone as much as anybody,

382
00:27:19,649 --> 00:27:24,026
but I don't understand how you cannot want
to look at the past, not think it's critical.

383
00:27:24,111 --> 00:27:27,527
What is critical, what is relevant,

384
00:27:27,615 --> 00:27:31,742
is the implementation
of a new strategy that will win this war,

385
00:27:31,827 --> 00:27:33,903
a war we cannot lose.

386
00:27:33,996 --> 00:27:36,783
- But we're not winning it.
- Yet.

387
00:27:36,873 --> 00:27:38,996
This new strategy can change that.

388
00:27:39,084 --> 00:27:42,369
How about a strategy
to bring the troops home?

389
00:27:46,424 --> 00:27:48,464
- So leave?
- That's not an option?

390
00:27:53,389 --> 00:27:56,343
OK. Let's... let's play this out.

391
00:27:57,643 --> 00:28:02,850
We walk, and Afghanistan
reverts back to the Taliban.

392
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,483
Only now the Taliban has metastasised
into something more vicious and potent

393
00:28:07,570 --> 00:28:10,606
because they're now 2 and 0
versus the superpowers.

394
00:28:10,698 --> 00:28:15,490
They'd butcher people who voted, who were
stupid enough to put their faith in our word.

395
00:28:15,577 --> 00:28:18,364
Call it not only the end of hope
for millions of Afghans

396
00:28:18,455 --> 00:28:20,494
but the end of American credibility,

397
00:28:20,582 --> 00:28:24,247
the end of America
as a force for righteousness in the world.

398
00:28:24,336 --> 00:28:27,751
When we're forced to go back
in a couple of years - quote me on this -

399
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:34,091
we'll square off against a shattered Iraq,
a hopeless Afghanistan and a nuclear Iran.

400
00:28:34,178 --> 00:28:37,879
How many troops are we gonna need then?
You'll be adding some zeros.

401
00:28:39,016 --> 00:28:40,475
Wait...

402
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,801
May I speak freely?

403
00:28:42,895 --> 00:28:47,058
You're about to implement
another new strategy

404
00:28:47,149 --> 00:28:51,360
regardless of the human cost
or the financial cost because you predict...

405
00:28:51,445 --> 00:28:54,944
We thought deeply about the human cost
when we planned this strategy.

406
00:28:55,032 --> 00:28:56,609
What were your estimates?

407
00:28:56,700 --> 00:29:01,326
What I can say is that this strategy
has patience and determination at its core.

408
00:29:01,413 --> 00:29:05,909
It ensures that it puts our fighting men
in spots where they can kill the enemy,

409
00:29:06,001 --> 00:29:09,037
so that we can then go about
rebuilding that country.

410
00:29:09,129 --> 00:29:12,213
And if it takes ten years, we stay.
We do whatever it takes.

411
00:29:12,298 --> 00:29:14,670
"Whatever it takes."

412
00:29:15,718 --> 00:29:18,339
Whatever it takes.

413
00:29:19,555 --> 00:29:22,841
Then why did it take three years
to up-armour our Humvees?

414
00:29:22,933 --> 00:29:24,511
They're up-armoured now...

415
00:29:24,602 --> 00:29:28,101
Add-ons don't provide the same protection,
Senator, you know that.

416
00:29:28,188 --> 00:29:32,649
Why does the president insist on spending
billions on subs and fighter planes

417
00:29:32,735 --> 00:29:34,561
that are useless in this kind of war?

418
00:29:34,653 --> 00:29:39,231
- What do you think I'm working on?
- And why did we send 150,000 troops

419
00:29:39,324 --> 00:29:43,156
to a country that did not attack us, and
one tenth that number to the one that did?

420
00:29:43,245 --> 00:29:46,613
How many times are you people
going to ask the same question?

421
00:29:46,706 --> 00:29:51,451
- Till we get the answer.
- OK. Here goes...

422
00:29:51,544 --> 00:29:55,162
- Iraq was almost a First World country.
- "Was" is the operative tense.

423
00:29:55,256 --> 00:29:57,296
We took it quick
because we had numbers.

424
00:29:57,383 --> 00:30:01,760
Afghanistan was, is, and always will be
the definition of rugged Third World.

425
00:30:01,846 --> 00:30:05,546
Big numbers have bogged down there
before Alexander became "The Great".

426
00:30:05,641 --> 00:30:08,428
We took Iraq? How did I miss that?

427
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:10,974
Militarily, we did.

428
00:30:11,063 --> 00:30:12,687
We made mistakes.

429
00:30:13,899 --> 00:30:18,146
Colossal mistakes
that should never be forgotten.

430
00:30:21,907 --> 00:30:27,245
But six years ago, who could have known
what to do or when to do it

431
00:30:27,329 --> 00:30:30,828
after watching our jets
fly into our buildings?

432
00:30:30,915 --> 00:30:35,162
Do you remember how petrified we were
at what our enemies might do for an encore?

433
00:30:35,253 --> 00:30:37,957
And how all at once
everything was at risk?

434
00:30:38,047 --> 00:30:40,716
Families, friends, the kindergartens...

435
00:30:41,342 --> 00:30:44,793
the rivers and bridges, nuclear plants.

436
00:30:46,597 --> 00:30:52,967
Do you remember how terror coloured
that next morning in shades we'd never seen?

437
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:57,854
And tens of thousands have died since
because of that fear,

438
00:30:57,941 --> 00:31:00,895
and the mistakes it inspired.

439
00:31:00,986 --> 00:31:05,612
But the question I'm left with,
the question that keeps me up at night,

440
00:31:05,699 --> 00:31:09,779
because I have to answer it,
is what do we do now?

441
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:20,291
Shit.

442
00:31:32,308 --> 00:31:35,059
First platoon?

443
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:40,516
My God. They're moving in.

444
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:57,952
- They're alive.
- OK.

445
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:02,834
- It's just snow blowing.
- Watch my flank.

446
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:06,336
- Give me the A-10 pilot. I want an ETA.
- They just said 18 minutes.

447
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,377
That was seven minutes ago.
I want to talk to the pilot now.

448
00:32:09,468 --> 00:32:14,344
Sir, the rescue bird is in its holding pattern
waiting for your word.

449
00:32:15,891 --> 00:32:19,307
All right. So, what,
Ernest and Arian, they volunteered?

450
00:32:19,394 --> 00:32:22,431
Is that a question or an accusation?

451
00:32:22,522 --> 00:32:26,022
- All right. It's just a question.
- Yes, they volunteered.

452
00:32:26,109 --> 00:32:28,944
They're adrenaline types.
They like it extreme...

453
00:32:29,029 --> 00:32:31,650
No, no.
Ernie and Arian aren't adrenaline types.

454
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,313
What I was talking about was fearless,

455
00:32:34,409 --> 00:32:38,323
being terrified
but willing yourself to the next step.

456
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:41,288
It's courage, right?

457
00:32:41,374 --> 00:32:43,497
But of the real kind.

458
00:32:44,418 --> 00:32:48,747
What are you afraid of, Todd?
Most everybody's afraid of not getting a job,

459
00:32:48,839 --> 00:32:52,422
or moving in with their parents,
or student-loan payments looming.

460
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:53,838
Yeah, that scares me.

461
00:32:53,927 --> 00:32:56,964
Or the voice in your head
that keeps asking awful questions:

462
00:32:57,055 --> 00:32:58,965
"Should I be doing more with my gifts?"

463
00:32:59,057 --> 00:33:02,260
"Am I making the most out of my time
here on this planet?"

464
00:33:02,352 --> 00:33:05,104
I think everybody
asks themselves those questions.

465
00:33:05,188 --> 00:33:08,557
A lot of us are afraid of the answers.

466
00:33:08,650 --> 00:33:12,019
Do you remember the second or third
lecture you ever had with me,

467
00:33:12,112 --> 00:33:13,903
when I called you out of the blue?

468
00:33:13,988 --> 00:33:17,523
You sat to the side where most of
you guys sit when you don't want to talk.

469
00:33:17,617 --> 00:33:20,108
You know,
close enough to have commitment,

470
00:33:20,203 --> 00:33:24,746
but just far enough away where I can't...
see you to call on you.

471
00:33:25,249 --> 00:33:28,832
It's called embarrassment.
You asked what I thought about the reading.

472
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:31,790
- I just said I didn't do the reading.
- But on reflex.

473
00:33:31,881 --> 00:33:34,253
No excuses, no bullshit, honest.

474
00:33:34,341 --> 00:33:38,173
- I was just terrified.
- But you willed yourself to the next step.

475
00:33:38,262 --> 00:33:42,473
And do you remember the subject we were
discussing, what that reading was about?

476
00:33:42,557 --> 00:33:44,597
You try to block embarrassing moments out.

477
00:33:44,684 --> 00:33:47,685
It was about that clinic
they were opening up on Adams.

478
00:33:47,771 --> 00:33:51,187
They were passing out
clean, free needles to addicts.

479
00:33:51,274 --> 00:33:53,646
A class of 80 people
thought that was a good idea.

480
00:33:53,735 --> 00:33:58,812
They thought, "Yeah. Stop the spreading
of disease and cut crime a bit." You said...

481
00:33:58,906 --> 00:34:02,322
Look, if we're gonna spend tax dollars,
our tax dollars,

482
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,533
to help people
break the law in a safer way,

483
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:08,404
why don't we have a designated
drunk-driver lane on the highway too?

484
00:34:08,499 --> 00:34:10,871
- What?
- It's a bigger problem than IV drug use.

485
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,367
- The same logic.
- You're talking economics.

486
00:34:13,462 --> 00:34:16,546
I'm talking economics,
and I'm also talking about safety.

487
00:34:16,632 --> 00:34:18,957
You didn't even read the assignment.

488
00:34:19,051 --> 00:34:21,624
- No, I didn't, but I can still think.
- He's right.

489
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,463
He's right.

490
00:34:23,555 --> 00:34:26,639
Yeah, well, I can kick a hornets' nest
with the best of them.

491
00:34:26,725 --> 00:34:30,259
Yeah, but the kid who didn't
read the assignment and admitted it

492
00:34:30,353 --> 00:34:35,181
becomes the centre of one of the most
interesting debates I've ever been a part of.

493
00:34:36,109 --> 00:34:38,944
Where did that kid go?

494
00:34:40,238 --> 00:34:45,824
So you think that the number of troops
that we have in Afghanistan now is enough?

495
00:34:45,910 --> 00:34:49,694
I do. And a big part of why we're able
to do more with less in Afghanistan,

496
00:34:49,789 --> 00:34:53,703
outside of the precise intel
that we have in the area,

497
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:56,959
is the superior nature
of our Special Forces.

498
00:34:57,046 --> 00:34:59,038
These guys are pros.

499
00:34:59,131 --> 00:35:01,704
It really reminds me of Abrams in '68.

500
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,086
- Abrams?
- Yeah. Remember?

501
00:35:05,178 --> 00:35:08,962
- How long ago was that?
- "Can't get the Vietcong in big fights

502
00:35:09,057 --> 00:35:12,426
so we'll send out smaller groups
they can't resist ambushing."

503
00:35:12,519 --> 00:35:17,477
"At least we'll be fighting." 58,000 names
say that strategy didn't work out so well.

504
00:35:17,565 --> 00:35:21,349
What is your problem with evolution?

505
00:35:21,444 --> 00:35:26,948
With capable platoons of Special Forces
soldiers surgically ferreting out the enemy?

506
00:35:27,033 --> 00:35:31,741
- Again, platoons are small.
- Again, small is the point.

507
00:35:32,538 --> 00:35:35,823
Abrams. What, do you TiVo
the History Channel?

508
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:37,992
No.

509
00:35:38,085 --> 00:35:41,418
'68 was my first year reporting.
It was my college newspaper.

510
00:35:41,505 --> 00:35:43,628
- Liberal rag?
- Yeah.

511
00:35:43,715 --> 00:35:45,874
I never lost my taste for it.

512
00:35:45,967 --> 00:35:48,921
Lucky me.

513
00:35:50,096 --> 00:35:53,299
- 1968.
- Yeah, you were six.

514
00:35:53,391 --> 00:35:56,427
But reading at a sixth-grade level.

515
00:35:56,895 --> 00:35:58,768
40 years in this racket.

516
00:35:58,855 --> 00:36:01,180
You don't have to say
the duration out loud.

517
00:36:01,274 --> 00:36:07,727
40 years means you should have enough
salt to know that we're at a tipping point.

518
00:36:07,822 --> 00:36:09,898
The American people need to understand

519
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:14,320
it is not only our choice to stop
these insurgents but our moral obligation.

520
00:36:14,411 --> 00:36:19,203
We simply cannot allow
their form of evil and terror to spread.

521
00:36:19,291 --> 00:36:24,582
And through precise military action
we will take the essential first step.

522
00:36:24,671 --> 00:36:29,629
First step? But what have we been doing
for the past six years, Senator?

523
00:36:29,718 --> 00:36:33,252
You know,
World War ll took less than five.

524
00:36:46,609 --> 00:36:48,483
Roll over.

525
00:36:48,569 --> 00:36:50,645
I gotta see your leg.

526
00:36:50,738 --> 00:36:52,730
See if it's compounded.

527
00:36:52,823 --> 00:36:55,279
Oh, God.

528
00:36:57,786 --> 00:37:00,277
- Don't black out.
- OK.

529
00:37:22,226 --> 00:37:24,552
You need a tourniquet.

530
00:37:24,645 --> 00:37:26,685
I'm one-handed.

531
00:37:47,918 --> 00:37:50,669
- Push through, brother. Push through.
- Shit.

532
00:37:50,754 --> 00:37:53,375
Rescue's comin'.

533
00:38:08,854 --> 00:38:10,894
Nothing debatable about it.

534
00:38:10,981 --> 00:38:14,433
Americans, if they're going
to accept yet another new strategy,

535
00:38:14,527 --> 00:38:19,023
want more than just vague admissions
of past mistakes.

536
00:38:19,114 --> 00:38:25,199
Can you tell me in your own words
exactly where you think we went wrong?

537
00:38:30,625 --> 00:38:32,867
Worst intel in our history.

538
00:38:34,129 --> 00:38:37,046
Decision makers
who've never bled in a fight.

539
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:39,709
Bad PR.

540
00:38:40,510 --> 00:38:42,502
Bad PR?

541
00:38:43,471 --> 00:38:47,848
You guys had a heyday with Abu Ghraib.
That was... that was quite the meal ticket.

542
00:38:47,934 --> 00:38:50,341
Have you ever bled in a fight?

543
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:54,894
- Intelligence. Six years.
- But not the infantry, right?

544
00:38:54,982 --> 00:38:58,980
You know this.
I graduated first in my class at West Point.

545
00:38:59,069 --> 00:39:02,937
I excelled at intelligence. Are you asking me
to apologise for an achievement?

546
00:39:03,031 --> 00:39:05,701
No, no, no. I would never do that.

547
00:39:12,791 --> 00:39:20,205
You know, here we are having
a high-minded debate about war and policy

548
00:39:20,298 --> 00:39:22,207
and it just occurred to me.

549
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:25,585
You're not gonna be able to fit a real story

550
00:39:25,678 --> 00:39:31,348
in between those "Home of the Free,
Land of the Obese" exposés

551
00:39:31,434 --> 00:39:35,478
and all your network's
entertainment coverage.

552
00:39:35,563 --> 00:39:38,813
If I keep my fingers crossed
I might get a seven-second mention

553
00:39:38,899 --> 00:39:42,766
from that focus-group-created
anchor of yours with the big hair.

554
00:39:42,861 --> 00:39:47,606
Forgive me.
It's Summer Hernandez-Kawalski?

555
00:39:47,699 --> 00:39:50,700
Is... is that her real name?

556
00:39:53,038 --> 00:39:55,030
What happened to you guys?

557
00:39:55,123 --> 00:39:57,993
- When did you all become a windsock?
- A what?

558
00:39:58,084 --> 00:40:01,204
Windsock.
Blows with the prevailing breeze.

559
00:40:01,296 --> 00:40:04,795
When did you start confusing
majority opinion with the right one?

560
00:40:04,882 --> 00:40:07,919
Sort of like when we supported
going into Iraq?

561
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:11,545
Supported? Oh, no, no, no, no.

562
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:16,348
You guys sold it. Your network led
every report about the invasion of Iraq

563
00:40:16,435 --> 00:40:20,100
with the screen-sized flag,
the square-jawed saluting marine

564
00:40:20,189 --> 00:40:23,190
and the bald eagle
soaring to Aaron Copland.

565
00:40:23,275 --> 00:40:27,320
That's because we believed and you believed
that Iraq was a legitimate enemy.

566
00:40:27,404 --> 00:40:31,733
You asked us for the benefit of the doubt
because we have troops in harm's way...

567
00:40:31,825 --> 00:40:36,072
Your network provided
that benefit without a blush.

568
00:40:36,162 --> 00:40:38,369
We gave it to you.

569
00:40:40,291 --> 00:40:42,331
We both... Janine.

570
00:40:43,211 --> 00:40:46,212
We both put our fighting men at risk.

571
00:40:48,216 --> 00:40:53,008
Now, I've admitted my mistakes.
When will you?

572
00:40:56,223 --> 00:41:01,134
- Call from Senator Skilken on line two.
- Thank you. Ask him to wait a second.

573
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:06,350
You know, in a sense,
we're on the same team.

574
00:41:06,441 --> 00:41:10,391
We're team-mates.
We both have a responsibility.

575
00:41:10,487 --> 00:41:15,777
You've already sold the war. Now
I'm asking you to help me sell the solution.

576
00:41:15,867 --> 00:41:17,990
Excuse me. I have to take this call.

577
00:41:18,078 --> 00:41:20,450
You could use the phone in here.

578
00:41:20,538 --> 00:41:24,370
You think I wanna let you
hear me beg for money?

579
00:43:10,560 --> 00:43:15,056
- Why are they waiting?
- Maybe trying to take us alive.

580
00:43:15,690 --> 00:43:18,015
Figuring out how.

581
00:43:29,287 --> 00:43:31,279
Breathe.

582
00:43:33,291 --> 00:43:34,833
Breathe.

583
00:43:43,133 --> 00:43:46,051
OK. Team one gets to set the bar.

584
00:43:46,136 --> 00:43:48,544
The topic they've pulled...

585
00:43:49,306 --> 00:43:51,713
"What foreign-relations theory or concept

586
00:43:51,808 --> 00:43:54,809
can best be applied here at home
to greater effect?"

587
00:43:54,895 --> 00:44:00,683
- Thank God it's not us.
- OK, you're up. 15 minutes, flame or fame.

588
00:44:14,872 --> 00:44:16,781
That's good.

589
00:44:19,418 --> 00:44:20,960
- Man!
- Hey. Hey!

590
00:44:21,045 --> 00:44:23,583
- What?
- You OK? You ready to do this?

591
00:44:23,672 --> 00:44:25,665
- Yeah.
- Breathe.

592
00:44:25,758 --> 00:44:27,715
- I'm breathing.
- Breathe.

593
00:44:27,801 --> 00:44:32,095
Gotta forgive my boy. He's so desperate
to get my dumb ass a good grade

594
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:35,845
he's either gonna shit his pants
or swallow his tongue.

595
00:44:37,561 --> 00:44:41,890
Know why they cut affirmative action?
It was his GPA.

596
00:44:46,277 --> 00:44:48,982
- So, what about you, Doc?
- What about me?

597
00:44:49,072 --> 00:44:51,859
Well, those who can't do, teach.

598
00:44:52,617 --> 00:44:57,362
Seriously, is being a professor
doing the most with what you were given?

599
00:44:57,455 --> 00:44:59,494
Are these your gifts?

600
00:44:59,582 --> 00:45:01,621
You got me.

601
00:45:02,793 --> 00:45:06,043
You know, 30 years ago
I had a whole different idea

602
00:45:06,130 --> 00:45:08,336
about what this job was gonna be.

603
00:45:08,423 --> 00:45:12,088
I was gonna publish theories
that would change thousands.

604
00:45:12,177 --> 00:45:14,882
The university fathers
were gonna be so impressed

605
00:45:14,971 --> 00:45:18,636
that they would offer me season tickets
on the 50 to make sure I stayed.

606
00:45:18,725 --> 00:45:22,141
- Jesus. Some elaborate daydreams there.
- Aren't they?

607
00:45:22,228 --> 00:45:23,972
Yeah.

608
00:45:24,063 --> 00:45:27,764
Papers I do get published don't get read.
Students do come to me for advice,

609
00:45:27,859 --> 00:45:30,646
but the school still spells
my name wrong on memos.

610
00:45:30,737 --> 00:45:36,193
- So, what, are you still here for the money?
- The money? God, no. No.

611
00:45:36,993 --> 00:45:40,112
I'm still here, Todd,
because I'm a selfish man.

612
00:45:41,497 --> 00:45:45,660
I'm selfish for the rare times when you know
you have someone in your class

613
00:45:45,751 --> 00:45:49,416
that has rare gifts to go on
and do big things on a big scale.

614
00:45:49,505 --> 00:45:54,332
I realised my gifts aren't my theories but my
ability to recognise great potential in others

615
00:45:54,426 --> 00:45:57,131
and maybe give them a little shove
when they need it.

616
00:45:57,220 --> 00:45:59,592
You think I'm one of those people?

617
00:45:59,681 --> 00:46:02,172
What do you think?

618
00:46:03,726 --> 00:46:09,231
Ernest and Arian, they were able
to show you they were rare? Like, every day?

619
00:46:09,315 --> 00:46:13,360
Just enough to erase doubt. No, the only
real difference between you and them

620
00:46:13,444 --> 00:46:16,778
is that you're a naturally gifted student.
They weren't.

621
00:46:16,864 --> 00:46:20,233
They had to work their asses off.
Didn't come easy for them.

622
00:46:20,326 --> 00:46:23,161
And they could also hit
90-mile-an-hour fastballs?

623
00:46:23,245 --> 00:46:26,696
- Hey, I'll trade 'em, Doc.
- No, they'd trade you.

624
00:46:26,790 --> 00:46:30,159
They went to these high schools
in the area where they grew up,

625
00:46:30,252 --> 00:46:34,296
godforsaken places that bear
no resemblance to the schools you went to.

626
00:46:34,381 --> 00:46:38,165
Metal detectors on every door,
teachers carrying Mace.

627
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:42,672
These awful places
did them not one favour.

628
00:46:42,764 --> 00:46:46,263
- I saw the same thing in Vietnam.
- What?

629
00:46:46,351 --> 00:46:50,479
The first guys to sign up to fight
are the ones this country doesn't treat well.

630
00:46:50,563 --> 00:46:53,766
Here are Ernest and Arian
growing up in these neighbourhoods

631
00:46:53,858 --> 00:46:56,942
where people butcher each other
for simple-minded shit.

632
00:46:57,028 --> 00:47:00,859
"You were raised in a neighbourhood
two blocks south from mine." Bam!

633
00:47:00,948 --> 00:47:03,783
"The rims on your car
are better than mine." Bam!

634
00:47:03,867 --> 00:47:08,695
What do they do after scraping themselves up
and getting outta there in one piece?

635
00:47:08,789 --> 00:47:11,825
Fight for the country
that ignores these neighbourhoods

636
00:47:11,917 --> 00:47:14,704
unless there's a riot
or a drive-by epidemic.

637
00:47:14,795 --> 00:47:20,215
On the flip side, you got kids that can take
advantage of every gift this country has.

638
00:47:20,300 --> 00:47:22,625
- Like me?
- Usually they're the first ones

639
00:47:22,719 --> 00:47:28,140
to take a big step back
when it comes time for volunteers.

640
00:47:28,224 --> 00:47:31,510
- Are you recruiting me?
- Recruiting you?

641
00:47:31,602 --> 00:47:37,890
You sold the army to Ernest and Arian
and now you're... you're trying to sell it to me.

642
00:47:40,152 --> 00:47:43,153
Three guys in that photo
never came home.

643
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:45,527
One guy's in prison for life.

644
00:47:45,616 --> 00:47:48,985
You wanna know what
the worst wound I ever got was?

645
00:47:50,621 --> 00:47:54,203
54 stitches protesting in Chicago
after I came home.

646
00:47:54,291 --> 00:47:57,245
I did just the opposite
of recruiting Ernest and Arian.

647
00:47:57,335 --> 00:48:00,040
Did I like what they did? No.
Did I agree with it? No.

648
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:03,499
It broke my heart. That doesn't mean
I don't revere the reasons.

649
00:48:03,591 --> 00:48:08,134
They believed the best way to change things
in this country was to go fight for it.

650
00:48:08,846 --> 00:48:12,630
Engagement. Engagement
is the foreign-relations concept

651
00:48:12,725 --> 00:48:14,801
that we would like to apply here at home.

652
00:48:14,894 --> 00:48:17,017
We're pretty good with it abroad.

653
00:48:17,104 --> 00:48:21,731
Our secretary of state has travelled
more miles than any in history

654
00:48:21,817 --> 00:48:24,024
and we have more embassies than ever.

655
00:48:24,111 --> 00:48:28,025
To your first point, isn't that
just because of easy access to jets?

656
00:48:28,115 --> 00:48:32,528
And to the second, aren't there just
more countries now to put embassies in?

657
00:48:33,745 --> 00:48:35,785
We can choose not to fly those jets

658
00:48:35,872 --> 00:48:38,707
and we can choose
not to recognise any new country.

659
00:48:38,792 --> 00:48:41,911
But choosing to do so,
I guess, is engagement.

660
00:48:43,254 --> 00:48:47,632
Again, we're pretty good
with engagement outside of our country,

661
00:48:47,717 --> 00:48:49,710
though we've had some big failures.

662
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:51,629
Like?

663
00:48:51,721 --> 00:48:55,054
Like 9/11 and Rwanda.

664
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:58,640
Somalia. There's a communist country
90 miles outside of Miami.

665
00:48:58,728 --> 00:49:01,135
We need more than 15 minutes
to talk about that.

666
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:06,271
- Yeah, well, no country's perfect.
- Every country should wanna be better.

667
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,649
Look, homeboy, if you cool with that,

668
00:49:08,737 --> 00:49:12,355
we'd like to use the time we have left
to focus on engagement

669
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:16,826
and how we see it abroad
and we don't see the same on our streets.

670
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:20,992
Now, we totally turned away
from the biggest problems here at home.

671
00:49:21,082 --> 00:49:24,866
The best way to double the size
of the problem is to turn your back on it.

672
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:27,203
So, who knew?
America needs to do more.

673
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:29,336
- We do.
- Why?

674
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:31,749
We do.

675
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:37,344
Like do away with your junior year
of high school.

676
00:49:37,431 --> 00:49:41,429
There's three options instead of going
to school. A Peace Corps year abroad,

677
00:49:41,519 --> 00:49:46,346
an AmeriCorps year here
in one of the 500 poorest zip codes

678
00:49:46,440 --> 00:49:49,013
or an ROTC-like apprenticeship
here or abroad,

679
00:49:49,109 --> 00:49:51,980
but everybody picks one
and nobody gets a note from Mom.

680
00:49:52,070 --> 00:49:54,146
Oh, man, come on.
Is this another joke?

681
00:49:54,239 --> 00:49:58,568
No, man. Was democracy a joke?
Was civil rights a joke?

682
00:49:58,660 --> 00:50:03,322
How about every junior learns to march
in formation and we invade our neighbours?

683
00:50:03,873 --> 00:50:06,744
We would get lost on the way.

684
00:50:06,835 --> 00:50:12,291
73% of all California freshmen cannot
name the country that borders Minnesota.

685
00:50:12,382 --> 00:50:18,502
Can you? 77% of all US freshmen cannot
name both senators from their home state.

686
00:50:18,596 --> 00:50:23,423
And 50% of all eighth-graders can't write
or do math at eighth-grade levels.

687
00:50:23,517 --> 00:50:27,894
And when 25% of our workers didn't function,
we called it a Great Depression.

688
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,897
What do we call 50%
of our students not functioning?

689
00:50:30,983 --> 00:50:33,141
A Greater Depression?

690
00:50:33,235 --> 00:50:35,642
Oh, and Canada borders Minnesota.

691
00:50:37,030 --> 00:50:39,782
That's the smartest thing
you've said all day.

692
00:50:40,408 --> 00:50:41,819
What about cost?

693
00:50:41,910 --> 00:50:44,615
How ridiculous
and unfeasible would they be?

694
00:50:44,704 --> 00:50:49,662
Not as ridiculous as the nine grand we spend
per student per year. Nine grand times what?

695
00:50:49,751 --> 00:50:53,202
3.8 million juniors.
That's $34 billion, man.

696
00:50:53,296 --> 00:50:56,712
We spend $2 billion more now
than we did five years back.

697
00:50:56,799 --> 00:50:57,962
For worse results.

698
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:02,511
Who won't wanna be part of an experience
where it's not about your race, your wealth,

699
00:51:02,596 --> 00:51:06,214
not even where you come from?
Common only because we're American.

700
00:51:06,308 --> 00:51:09,226
I guarantee you
that would make us better for life.

701
00:51:09,311 --> 00:51:14,020
And the shame is we don't get that type
of level playing ground, not in this country,

702
00:51:14,107 --> 00:51:16,349
unless there's a draft.

703
00:51:18,987 --> 00:51:22,937
So I'd have to stay in school a year longer?

704
00:51:23,033 --> 00:51:25,606
You've been here eight years, bro.

705
00:51:26,828 --> 00:51:30,279
We could all, with all the degrees
and the money we're gonna make,

706
00:51:30,373 --> 00:51:33,576
go hide in a big house with high walls.

707
00:51:33,668 --> 00:51:38,579
When hasn't a big house with high walls
been the American dream?

708
00:51:38,673 --> 00:51:40,831
July 5, 1776.

709
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:44,041
What about December 8, 1941?

710
00:51:44,553 --> 00:51:47,388
September 12, 2001.

711
00:51:47,473 --> 00:51:51,387
You don't wanna go to Harvard Law
or Stanford Business after you graduate?

712
00:51:51,477 --> 00:51:54,228
You don't wanna make money?
I say bullshit.

713
00:51:54,313 --> 00:51:59,983
I think it's totally hypocritical
for you to just talk this giant game.

714
00:52:00,735 --> 00:52:03,191
Let's do it, man. All right.

715
00:52:08,743 --> 00:52:10,736
What?

716
00:52:14,415 --> 00:52:16,989
That's weird.

717
00:52:17,085 --> 00:52:19,291
Are they kidding?

718
00:52:24,967 --> 00:52:27,968
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

719
00:52:34,476 --> 00:52:37,347
Doc, you look like
you getting ulcers over there.

720
00:52:37,437 --> 00:52:40,723
I've had the ulcers.
The question is whether they're bleeding.

721
00:52:40,816 --> 00:52:44,599
Oh, you gotta stop thinking
that project made us enlist. It didn't.

722
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:46,770
I don't believe that.
Come on, you guys.

723
00:52:46,863 --> 00:52:49,235
You two could pick
any grad school in any field.

724
00:52:49,324 --> 00:52:53,024
- $200,000 in the hole when you graduate.
- Loan forgiveness programmes?

725
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:57,995
Yeah, there are programmes,
but they're not as forgiving as they advertise.

726
00:52:58,082 --> 00:53:02,791
- Arian's doing a lot of talking for both of you.
- You think he did the math all by himself?

727
00:53:02,878 --> 00:53:06,378
Doc, you're the one who tells us
not to live over a safety net.

728
00:53:06,465 --> 00:53:09,419
I didn't think that would translate
to heading out to a war.

729
00:53:09,510 --> 00:53:11,502
If I did, I would have cut my tongue out.

730
00:53:11,595 --> 00:53:13,338
- You're missing the point.
- Yeah.

731
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:15,506
Because I can't say
the army is a better gig

732
00:53:15,599 --> 00:53:18,351
than schools
most students would give an arm to get into?

733
00:53:18,435 --> 00:53:21,638
No, because you're not seeing
that if we did anything else,

734
00:53:21,730 --> 00:53:25,181
we wouldn't be a part of the
most important things going on right now.

735
00:53:25,275 --> 00:53:27,647
Doc, these events
are going to define our lives,

736
00:53:27,736 --> 00:53:29,942
just the same way Vietnam did for yours.

737
00:53:31,489 --> 00:53:33,861
I didn't enlist. I was drafted.

738
00:53:36,994 --> 00:53:40,695
World War I,
German soldiers wrote poems

739
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:42,948
about the bravery of British grunts,

740
00:53:43,042 --> 00:53:46,209
admired them, almost as much
as they laughed at the high command

741
00:53:46,295 --> 00:53:50,209
who wasted those same grunts
by the hundreds of thousands.

742
00:53:50,299 --> 00:53:52,126
A German general wrote:

743
00:53:52,217 --> 00:53:55,717
"Nowhere else have I seen
such lions led by such lambs."

744
00:53:56,930 --> 00:54:00,097
Christ, that statement
is so dead-on right now.

745
00:54:00,183 --> 00:54:03,766
These starched collars that started this war,
that are running it now,

746
00:54:03,854 --> 00:54:07,768
nowhere near the best and the brightest,
not even in the same galaxy.

747
00:54:07,857 --> 00:54:11,807
They're the ones that, when our men
are blown to bits in the middle of a gun battle,

748
00:54:11,903 --> 00:54:16,529
say shit like, "The enemy has bloodied
our nose, but we're learning from mistakes."

749
00:54:16,616 --> 00:54:19,071
We agree. What's the problem?

750
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:21,829
"So what's the problem?"
What are you talking about?

751
00:54:21,913 --> 00:54:24,450
We already know
how the system works.

752
00:54:24,540 --> 00:54:27,292
- Guys, think. Think.
- We've thought that far ahead.

753
00:54:27,376 --> 00:54:31,705
Because it's going badly
makes it even more important, Doc.

754
00:54:31,797 --> 00:54:34,122
I don't... Tell... What do you mean?

755
00:54:34,216 --> 00:54:37,751
We wouldn't have spent three weeks
in school on Nixon without Watergate.

756
00:54:37,844 --> 00:54:39,920
If we'd killed Bin Laden on 9/12,

757
00:54:40,013 --> 00:54:43,133
or if Iraqi Shiites greeted us
with a ticker-tape parade,

758
00:54:43,225 --> 00:54:46,179
we would never have to think about,
"Who are these people?"

759
00:54:46,269 --> 00:54:48,226
"Does religion really preach murder?"

760
00:54:48,313 --> 00:54:51,397
"Do they need a dictator
to stop them massacring each other?"

761
00:54:51,483 --> 00:54:55,610
The greatest military in history
can't catch three guys. Come on.

762
00:54:55,695 --> 00:54:58,020
And how do you preach democracy

763
00:54:58,114 --> 00:55:02,242
and still send billions to Saudi kings
who are the furthest thing from it?

764
00:55:02,326 --> 00:55:05,244
- So load yourselves into the breach?
- Or sit on the bench.

765
00:55:05,329 --> 00:55:09,243
The men who lead
do work when there's work to be done.

766
00:55:09,333 --> 00:55:12,784
Will you step up when you're needed,
or will you just sit back

767
00:55:12,878 --> 00:55:14,954
and let the other people do the lifting?

768
00:55:15,047 --> 00:55:16,790
They're simple questions.

769
00:55:16,882 --> 00:55:19,918
With potentially really awful answers.
Guys, trust me.

770
00:55:20,010 --> 00:55:26,262
Please trust that if I thought this fight
was worth the sweat, I'd back you, I would.

771
00:55:26,349 --> 00:55:29,516
But what about stepping up here,
changing policy at home?

772
00:55:29,602 --> 00:55:32,639
Look, we go do this now,
then we come back and go to school.

773
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:35,019
- On the army's dime.
- Then we can do something.

774
00:55:35,108 --> 00:55:38,559
Black and Mexican combat vets
with an education.

775
00:55:38,653 --> 00:55:40,692
Goddamn.

776
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:43,022
No debt to dictate what we do next.

777
00:55:43,115 --> 00:55:45,523
They gotta listen to us then, Doc.

778
00:55:45,618 --> 00:55:48,322
We can change things.

779
00:55:49,663 --> 00:55:51,122
If.

780
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:56,626
If.

781
00:56:28,117 --> 00:56:32,280
- Why isn't Tali rushing 'em, finishing it?
- We're worth more captured than killed.

782
00:56:32,371 --> 00:56:34,198
The pilot.

783
00:56:34,289 --> 00:56:36,081
- ETA to my boys?
- 19 minutes.

784
00:56:36,166 --> 00:56:38,835
All right.
When you get there, you shoot straight.

785
00:56:38,919 --> 00:56:40,911
Apprise the rescue chopper of this.

786
00:56:41,004 --> 00:56:44,455
You tell 'em we've got an A-10 bomber
moving in to clean it out

787
00:56:44,549 --> 00:56:48,962
but they are heading into
a still-hot LZ with exposed friendlies.

788
00:56:49,054 --> 00:56:52,921
I want you to make sure this is heading
the correct way up the command chain.

789
00:56:53,016 --> 00:56:57,227
You tell 'em this is not as easy
as it looks 9,000 miles away.

790
00:56:59,230 --> 00:57:02,729
Janine, I'm sorry to keep you waiting.
There's a vote up now, so I...

791
00:57:02,817 --> 00:57:04,525
Can I just...?

792
00:57:04,610 --> 00:57:07,148
In 1991, my network, ANX,

793
00:57:07,238 --> 00:57:12,576
was bought by a corporation best known
for selling soap and light bulbs.

794
00:57:12,660 --> 00:57:16,953
Overnight, we went from an organisation
preoccupied with gathering news

795
00:57:17,039 --> 00:57:21,416
to a business unit
preoccupied with ad revenue and ratings.

796
00:57:22,961 --> 00:57:25,250
A windsock. And I knew it.

797
00:57:25,338 --> 00:57:28,921
When I signed my contract, I knew it.
I thought I could keep my autonomy.

798
00:57:29,009 --> 00:57:32,424
I thought that raise they gave me
meant they were still committed to,

799
00:57:32,512 --> 00:57:34,386
uh, hard news, but anyway...

800
00:57:34,472 --> 00:57:37,758
Janine, sit, please.

801
00:57:46,442 --> 00:57:50,486
- Thank you for that.
- It's just the truth.

802
00:57:50,571 --> 00:57:53,026
How can I...?

803
00:57:53,115 --> 00:57:57,160
How can I verify the results of this mission?
You won't embed press with troops?

804
00:57:57,244 --> 00:57:58,987
- No. No. There's no room.
- Right.

805
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:03,907
Special Forces travel fast and light. I can
provide infrared and gun-camera footage.

806
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:06,954
Oh, great. Those are always
the most popular downloads.

807
00:58:07,045 --> 00:58:09,750
Developing details
will come directly from me to you.

808
00:58:09,839 --> 00:58:12,674
Great. Thank you.
Now let me kill the good feeling.

809
00:58:12,759 --> 00:58:14,253
You? Really?

810
00:58:14,344 --> 00:58:18,673
Worst-case scenario...
Forward operating points don't work.

811
00:58:18,765 --> 00:58:21,172
They will work.

812
00:58:21,267 --> 00:58:26,510
Have you... Has the president
contemplated surging the troops

813
00:58:26,606 --> 00:58:29,476
in support of this strategy,
if it's necessary?

814
00:58:29,567 --> 00:58:32,484
The military
is stretched pretty thin right now.

815
00:58:32,570 --> 00:58:34,811
Maybe you'll send kids
that didn't sign up?

816
00:58:34,905 --> 00:58:37,478
A draft? No, no, no.
We don't need it.

817
00:58:37,574 --> 00:58:40,741
We have everything we need
to break the enemy right now,

818
00:58:40,827 --> 00:58:43,235
except the public will to do it.

819
00:58:43,330 --> 00:58:45,655
That's where you come in.

820
00:58:46,958 --> 00:58:49,532
How do we know
you're going to get it right this time?

821
00:58:49,628 --> 00:58:52,000
You know, people are very mistrustful.

822
00:58:52,088 --> 00:58:54,758
after 9/11,
we had the whole world on our side.

823
00:58:54,841 --> 00:58:58,885
Six years later we're stumbling through
one of the worst times to be an American.

824
00:58:58,970 --> 00:59:01,425
Look, Janine,
hyperbole is not gonna do us...

825
00:59:01,514 --> 00:59:04,681
Come on.
Nobody is monitoring our patriotism here.

826
00:59:04,767 --> 00:59:09,144
You have to admit, this is one of the five
worst times to fly the Stars and Stripes.

827
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:11,637
- People need...
- A win, Janine.

828
00:59:12,441 --> 00:59:15,561
The people, the president, me,

829
00:59:15,653 --> 00:59:18,322
we all need a win in Afghanistan.

830
00:59:18,405 --> 00:59:20,314
Winning allows our public to refocus.

831
00:59:20,407 --> 00:59:24,072
Winning gets Congress
back in the mood to talk instead of yell.

832
00:59:24,161 --> 00:59:26,486
- It helps Afghanistan.
- Goes without saying.

833
00:59:26,580 --> 00:59:28,453
And it helps your party.

834
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:32,834
We are the party that represents security,
the power that this country is known for.

835
00:59:32,919 --> 00:59:35,457
The party that signals
to tyrants the world over

836
00:59:35,547 --> 00:59:38,797
that the USA has the stomach
and stamina to finish our fights.

837
00:59:38,883 --> 00:59:40,959
"Finish"?

838
00:59:41,052 --> 00:59:43,091
Do you want to win, Janine?

839
00:59:43,179 --> 00:59:45,551
- What?
- Do you want to win the war on terror?

840
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:47,383
Yes or no?

841
00:59:47,475 --> 00:59:50,013
- Yes or no?
- It's a broad...

842
00:59:50,102 --> 00:59:53,803
OK. See this? This is the quintessential
yes-or-no question of our time.

843
00:59:53,898 --> 00:59:56,685
Equivocation is defeat.
You stop and you're dead.

844
00:59:56,775 --> 00:59:59,064
The only option for America...

845
00:59:59,153 --> 01:00:01,062
Excuse me.

846
01:00:07,369 --> 01:00:09,361
Excuse me.

847
01:00:13,166 --> 01:00:15,574
Irving.

848
01:00:32,893 --> 01:00:35,135
When?

849
01:00:35,938 --> 01:00:37,313
Ammo.

850
01:01:10,763 --> 01:01:12,257
Reloading!

851
01:01:13,057 --> 01:01:16,260
- How much ammo do they have left?
- How the fuck would I know?

852
01:01:16,352 --> 01:01:21,346
- Why aren't the Tali hitting them?
- To get them to empty their clips.

853
01:01:23,901 --> 01:01:26,438
Keep me posted.

854
01:01:31,324 --> 01:01:33,815
It's just covering fire!
Save your ammo!

855
01:01:50,426 --> 01:01:55,384
I'll tell you what, I'm sick and tired, Janine.
I am sick and tired of being humiliated.

856
01:01:55,472 --> 01:01:59,256
Over and over again we have allowed
our great country to be threatened

857
01:01:59,351 --> 01:02:03,847
by these little tribal ragtag... gangs.

858
01:02:03,939 --> 01:02:05,896
And it's going to stop.

859
01:02:09,528 --> 01:02:12,363
Do you realise what we've got?

860
01:02:12,447 --> 01:02:15,982
Do you realise what our capability is?

861
01:02:18,411 --> 01:02:21,495
Because God knows...

862
01:02:21,581 --> 01:02:23,490
it...

863
01:02:23,583 --> 01:02:27,497
breaks my heart
to ask the men and women in uniform

864
01:02:27,587 --> 01:02:30,504
to risk their lives for this victory...

865
01:02:31,549 --> 01:02:34,752
when I know in my gut
there is no other way to that end.

866
01:02:34,844 --> 01:02:38,841
Not with this enemy.
Not with their medieval beliefs.

867
01:02:42,226 --> 01:02:47,302
But the solace that I can
provide the families of our fallen,

868
01:02:47,397 --> 01:02:49,769
with absolute conviction...

869
01:02:51,193 --> 01:02:55,190
is that at least
their lives were about something.

870
01:03:04,122 --> 01:03:07,905
Now, to tax internet transactions
or not tax internet transactions,

871
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,076
that is the question.

872
01:03:10,169 --> 01:03:11,414
- Marcia.
- Senator?

873
01:03:11,504 --> 01:03:13,212
My notes, please.

874
01:03:16,008 --> 01:03:20,337
- This is your strategy, is it not, sir?
- It is the product of new-school thinking.

875
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:24,592
You are the school. You have the ear of the
president more than the defence secretary.

876
01:03:24,683 --> 01:03:28,182
- So?
- So if it succeeds with your name on it,

877
01:03:28,270 --> 01:03:30,393
it's a great way of separating yourself out

878
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:34,430
from the rest of the pack in your party
who would like to be president.

879
01:03:34,526 --> 01:03:37,811
Let me state this as loudly as possible.

880
01:03:37,904 --> 01:03:40,442
I'm not running for president.

881
01:03:43,576 --> 01:03:48,072
This has been a good hour.
This is a big story, and it's yours.

882
01:03:48,164 --> 01:03:52,078
This is my direct number.
Call if you have any questions.

883
01:03:52,168 --> 01:03:55,537
- Thank you.
- Marcia, could you come in?

884
01:04:50,182 --> 01:04:52,388
- Hey.
- Yeah?

885
01:05:14,080 --> 01:05:16,997
- Any idea how many left?
- A dozen or more.

886
01:05:17,082 --> 01:05:20,202
Phone the A-10. Tell him to make runs
until he's out of ammo.

887
01:05:20,294 --> 01:05:24,042
ETA on the rescue bird is six minutes.
Headwinds.

888
01:05:24,715 --> 01:05:27,716
Put me back on with the pilot.

889
01:05:34,724 --> 01:05:37,476
Can they see us?

890
01:05:51,991 --> 01:05:55,111
- Is it over?
- For us if they lived!

891
01:05:55,703 --> 01:05:57,695
Eyes up!

892
01:06:06,046 --> 01:06:09,581
So I'm supposed to go implement
Arian and Ernie's junior-year project,

893
01:06:09,675 --> 01:06:12,878
even though that thing
sounds like a fairy tale to me?

894
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:15,377
- You gave them an A for that?
- I gave them a B plus.

895
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:17,548
- What?
- B plus. They were loose on stats.

896
01:06:17,641 --> 01:06:20,594
I heard. Why don't you tell me
about students who got an A?

897
01:06:20,685 --> 01:06:22,559
Cos I don't remember them right now.

898
01:06:22,645 --> 01:06:26,643
So attendance is a prerequisite for you,
but grades aren't?

899
01:06:26,733 --> 01:06:30,730
You're onto the secret now, Todd.
It's called potential.

900
01:06:30,820 --> 01:06:33,441
That's a far better signal
of what you might do

901
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:36,947
than getting an A in some class
you might forget about in two years.

902
01:06:37,034 --> 01:06:41,032
Sounds a lot like what kids with 2.4s
tell themselves to justify all the Cs.

903
01:06:41,121 --> 01:06:43,612
Neither got Cs.

904
01:06:43,707 --> 01:06:46,625
- Maybe both got blue-collar Bs.
- Not by quitting.

905
01:06:48,921 --> 01:06:50,996
Are you happy they're over there?

906
01:06:51,089 --> 01:06:54,173
Todd, I told you twice,
I did everything I could to stop them.

907
01:06:54,259 --> 01:06:56,168
- But revered why they didn't?
- Yeah.

908
01:06:56,261 --> 01:07:00,424
So I'm supposed to listen to your advice,
this direction you're trying to give me,

909
01:07:00,515 --> 01:07:04,595
even though the two you've been
telling me about... didn't listen?

910
01:07:04,686 --> 01:07:08,351
They went ahead.
They did what they were gonna do anyway.

911
01:07:08,439 --> 01:07:13,184
And maybe, just maybe,
you might be dropping the hammer on me

912
01:07:13,277 --> 01:07:17,738
because of how... how rarely you find
a student you think is worth the time,

913
01:07:17,823 --> 01:07:20,492
and how often, it sounds like...

914
01:07:21,660 --> 01:07:25,325
you failed at getting through
once you did find those students.

915
01:07:25,414 --> 01:07:31,167
Actually, the failing
started about ten, maybe 15, years ago.

916
01:07:31,253 --> 01:07:36,164
You know, the truth is, Todd, I used
to knock meetings like this out of the park.

917
01:07:36,258 --> 01:07:40,041
- What changed?
- You. Students sitting across from me.

918
01:07:40,136 --> 01:07:42,176
Cos we're shrewd,
we see how things work,

919
01:07:42,263 --> 01:07:45,050
cos we don't want to die
for these pieces of shit.

920
01:07:45,141 --> 01:07:48,676
You put as much distance between yourself
and the real world as you can.

921
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:51,439
Pieces of shit -
how many times you gonna say that? -

922
01:07:51,522 --> 01:07:56,480
they bank on your apathy,
they bank on your wilful ignorance.

923
01:07:56,569 --> 01:08:01,396
They plan strategies around it, figure out
what they can get away with because of it.

924
01:08:01,490 --> 01:08:05,570
So blame me for it all. Blame me, because
I might just want to live the good life

925
01:08:05,661 --> 01:08:08,234
because I can
because I'm smart enough to.

926
01:08:08,330 --> 01:08:11,913
Are you gonna blame me because
I don't wanna work elbow to elbow with you

927
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:14,206
on a goddamn collective farm?

928
01:08:14,294 --> 01:08:17,046
Doc, you are sounding
a hell of a lot like my parents.

929
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:20,131
They harp on how they're
giving me a better life than they had

930
01:08:20,216 --> 01:08:23,550
and then they resent the shit out of me
cos I got the nerve to enjoy it.

931
01:08:23,636 --> 01:08:27,219
Todd, what good is a $90,000 Benz

932
01:08:27,307 --> 01:08:29,632
if there's not only
not enough gas in the tank

933
01:08:29,726 --> 01:08:34,268
but the streets and highways are decaying
to the point of becoming Third World?

934
01:08:34,355 --> 01:08:39,266
If all your rants about Congress and politics
are true, Todd,

935
01:08:39,360 --> 01:08:42,729
if things are really bad,
as bad as you say they are,

936
01:08:42,821 --> 01:08:46,653
when thousands of American troops
are dead and more are dying as we speak,

937
01:08:46,742 --> 01:08:51,071
you tell me,
how can you enjoy the good life?

938
01:08:51,163 --> 01:08:55,374
Rome is burning, son, and the problem
is not with the people that started this.

939
01:08:55,459 --> 01:08:59,326
They're past irredeemable.
The problem's with us - all of us -

940
01:08:59,421 --> 01:09:04,332
who do nothing, who just fiddle, who try
to manoeuvre around the edges of the flame.

941
01:09:04,425 --> 01:09:09,004
And I'll tell you something, there are people
out there fighting to make things better.

942
01:09:09,097 --> 01:09:12,014
You think it's better to try and fail
than fail to try?

943
01:09:12,099 --> 01:09:15,468
- Yeah.
- But what if you end up in the same place?

944
01:09:20,941 --> 01:09:23,148
At least you did something.

945
01:09:38,166 --> 01:09:41,582
Thanks for knocking.
What did l'enfant terrible want?

946
01:09:41,670 --> 01:09:45,584
- One-on-one time. Whole hour.
- An hour? Jesus. A beating or a story?

947
01:09:45,673 --> 01:09:49,173
A big new military move
launched as we sat there.

948
01:09:49,260 --> 01:09:52,546
An exclusive? Damn. Details.

949
01:09:52,638 --> 01:09:57,300
Let's get the basics up on the scroll
right away. What's the action?

950
01:09:58,769 --> 01:10:01,438
- Janine. Hello?
- It stinks.

951
01:10:01,522 --> 01:10:07,358
I mean, I don't know. I just came away
with a bad feeling. It just... it feels...

952
01:10:07,444 --> 01:10:09,603
- Feels?
-..bogus.

953
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:14,822
It feels? Are you being paid to investigate
your feelings? Just give me the facts.

954
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:17,531
- You know, we can't do this again.
- Do what again?

955
01:10:17,621 --> 01:10:20,787
We can't just buy
the whole little programme

956
01:10:20,874 --> 01:10:23,080
like we did for the run-up at the fir...

957
01:10:23,168 --> 01:10:26,583
Oh, please. Stand back
while my fucking head detonates.

958
01:10:26,671 --> 01:10:28,913
- This is your guy, right?
- He's not my guy.

959
01:10:29,007 --> 01:10:33,834
He goes right to you. He's handing you
an exclusive. He's giving you a fucking gift.

960
01:10:33,928 --> 01:10:35,837
It's not a gift. It's propaganda.

961
01:10:35,930 --> 01:10:39,050
We don't have to broadcast
everything the government wants.

962
01:10:39,141 --> 01:10:43,850
No, we broadcast news.
The launch of a new military move is news.

963
01:10:43,938 --> 01:10:48,599
Are you feeling a teensy conscience attack
here? Isn't it a little late for that?

964
01:10:48,692 --> 01:10:51,064
Come on. What is the story?
What is the move?

965
01:10:51,153 --> 01:10:55,020
Are you old enough to remember
The Who? The Who.

966
01:10:55,115 --> 01:10:58,032
- And young enough to listen to 'em.
- Meet the new boss

967
01:10:58,118 --> 01:11:00,075
Same as the old boss...
That's what.

968
01:11:00,161 --> 01:11:03,447
It's the Vietnam-era thinking
and they just repackaged.

969
01:11:03,540 --> 01:11:08,083
They're gonna send out small platoons,
these kids, as bait. It's the same...

970
01:11:08,169 --> 01:11:12,036
No, no. That is speculation.
We do not air speculation, OK?

971
01:11:12,131 --> 01:11:16,460
No, no. It's these guys.
They're so desperate for a way out, see.

972
01:11:16,552 --> 01:11:21,510
They're so desperate to change the subject
from Iraq, they're so desperate for a win,

973
01:11:21,599 --> 01:11:25,810
that they're listening to Irving, and I don't
blame them because, boy, he is good.

974
01:11:25,894 --> 01:11:29,939
But he doesn't have a plan
for the day after the attack. No.

975
01:11:30,023 --> 01:11:34,353
I mean, he'll croon about hearts and minds,
but it's all helicopters and marines.

976
01:11:34,444 --> 01:11:39,320
That's what... Jesus. Anyway,
he couldn't care less about the soft stuff.

977
01:11:39,407 --> 01:11:44,698
This whole thing is a strategic... it's
a lubricant to get him into the White House.

978
01:11:44,788 --> 01:11:47,113
So what? So the guy's ambitious.

979
01:11:47,207 --> 01:11:51,952
So what? Wait. Janine, are you letting
your politics cloud your reasoning?

980
01:11:52,045 --> 01:11:53,752
I'm just trying to do my job.

981
01:11:53,838 --> 01:11:58,547
Your job is to report verifiable facts
so I can put 'em on the goddamn screen.

982
01:11:58,634 --> 01:12:01,339
There are none! OK?
There are no embeds up there.

983
01:12:01,429 --> 01:12:07,431
We have to just take his word for it. It's just...
How can you stand it so hot in here?

984
01:12:10,187 --> 01:12:14,054
But I'll tell you something.
He does have a plan for after the election.

985
01:12:14,149 --> 01:12:17,352
And it's not the long, slow peace process.
No, no, no, no.

986
01:12:17,444 --> 01:12:20,149
These boys have toys on the high shelf

987
01:12:20,238 --> 01:12:22,610
they've not been allowed
to use for 50 years.

988
01:12:22,699 --> 01:12:28,867
- He says, "I'm sick of being humiliated..."
- Don't start that nuclear paranoia bullshit.

989
01:12:28,955 --> 01:12:31,790
Find out what a real
winning noise sounds like.

990
01:12:31,874 --> 01:12:34,875
He said this to me. I have it. I have it.

991
01:12:34,961 --> 01:12:38,045
"Whatever it takes to win."

992
01:12:38,130 --> 01:12:40,253
Here it is. See? "Whatever it takes."

993
01:12:40,341 --> 01:12:45,762
Great, great. Can you please just...
just calm down, OK? Calm down.

994
01:12:49,725 --> 01:12:53,259
Look, it seems to me
like Irving has a plan

995
01:12:53,353 --> 01:12:56,722
to go after the guys
who attacked us, OK?

996
01:12:56,815 --> 01:13:00,480
Now, our viewers will believe
that's a good thing. So do I.

997
01:13:02,529 --> 01:13:04,984
What happened to you, Howard?

998
01:13:05,865 --> 01:13:10,194
Time was you would take a punch at anybody
if you thought it was justified.

999
01:13:10,286 --> 01:13:12,362
You were good once.

1000
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:18,452
Yeah, and I didn't think I'd live past 40,
either. Come on, Janine.

1001
01:13:18,544 --> 01:13:22,494
You can't leave me hanging out here
by myself. You just can't do that to...

1002
01:13:22,590 --> 01:13:27,666
Wrong. I just can't do this. You turn in
some loony, speculative, what-if story

1003
01:13:27,761 --> 01:13:33,266
based on what? A woman's intuition?
I expected more from you, Janine.

1004
01:13:33,350 --> 01:13:35,888
Yeah, you expected me
to turn in a tidy time line.

1005
01:13:35,978 --> 01:13:39,892
- That's right.
- If we don't do this, who's gonna do it?

1006
01:13:39,981 --> 01:13:44,311
This is the job! These politicians,
these journalists, everybody that says:

1007
01:13:44,402 --> 01:13:48,815
"Oh, well, if we'd known then what
we know now..." It's bullshit! It's bullshit.

1008
01:13:48,907 --> 01:13:55,525
It was all right there. We knew it,
if we had bothered to connect the dots.

1009
01:13:55,621 --> 01:14:00,698
But we didn't, did we?
We just rolled over, right?

1010
01:14:01,544 --> 01:14:05,162
So what happens
if you're wrong, Janine? Huh?

1011
01:14:05,256 --> 01:14:07,877
Listen to me. You're 57 years old.

1012
01:14:07,967 --> 01:14:11,335
You got a mother
that needs 24-hour care now.

1013
01:14:11,428 --> 01:14:16,007
What other network
is gonna snap you up after this, huh?

1014
01:14:17,809 --> 01:14:21,510
- All I'm asking...
- Just don't put me in this position, OK?

1015
01:14:21,605 --> 01:14:26,397
Your version of this story will never
see the light of day and you know it.

1016
01:14:29,404 --> 01:14:33,022
Well, I can't write the one that he gave me.

1017
01:14:33,116 --> 01:14:35,689
Can't.

1018
01:14:42,875 --> 01:14:46,493
Well, I think you ought to think that over.

1019
01:15:15,114 --> 01:15:17,605
- Get to me!
- I'm digging!

1020
01:15:21,912 --> 01:15:24,830
Get to me!

1021
01:15:24,915 --> 01:15:27,287
Come on.

1022
01:15:53,943 --> 01:15:55,852
Pilot.

1023
01:15:55,945 --> 01:15:59,563
Get back there, make another pass
and clean those fucking Talis out.

1024
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:10,663
Read the sign.

1025
01:16:12,878 --> 01:16:14,835
Wait.

1026
01:16:14,922 --> 01:16:17,044
Are we done?

1027
01:16:17,132 --> 01:16:19,125
OK.

1028
01:16:20,302 --> 01:16:23,671
Here's my last bit, so bear with me.

1029
01:16:26,266 --> 01:16:29,765
The decisions you make now,
bud, can't be changed

1030
01:16:29,853 --> 01:16:33,850
but with years and years
of hard work to redo it.

1031
01:16:33,940 --> 01:16:37,688
And in those years
you become something different.

1032
01:16:37,777 --> 01:16:42,403
Everybody does as time passes.
You get married, you get into debt.

1033
01:16:42,490 --> 01:16:46,238
But you're never gonna be
the same person you are right now.

1034
01:16:46,327 --> 01:16:49,530
And promise and potential...

1035
01:16:51,373 --> 01:16:53,366
It's very fickle.

1036
01:16:54,710 --> 01:16:58,209
And it just might not be there any more.

1037
01:17:01,633 --> 01:17:05,417
Are you assuming
I already made a decision?

1038
01:17:05,512 --> 01:17:08,299
And also that I'll live to regret it?

1039
01:17:08,390 --> 01:17:11,972
All I'm saying is that you're an adult now.

1040
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:16,353
And the tough thing
about adulthood is that it...

1041
01:17:16,439 --> 01:17:20,057
it starts before you even know it starts,

1042
01:17:20,151 --> 01:17:23,187
when you're already
a dozen decisions into it.

1043
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:28,569
But what you need to know, Todd,
no lifeguard's watching any more.

1044
01:17:28,659 --> 01:17:31,494
You're on your own.
You're your own man,

1045
01:17:31,578 --> 01:17:37,118
and the decisions you make now are yours
and yours alone from here until the end.

1046
01:17:37,209 --> 01:17:40,494
I'm sorry. The sign says till eight
and it's way after eight.

1047
01:17:40,587 --> 01:17:44,038
- Yes. Sorry.
- So, what, you don't want my decision?

1048
01:17:44,132 --> 01:17:48,628
Class meets again Tuesday at nine.
I'll find out then.

1049
01:17:54,559 --> 01:17:58,307
- OK, Muna. What...?
- The grade you gave me can't be right.

1050
01:17:58,396 --> 01:18:03,188
You mean a C plus? Excuse me.
Close the door behind you.

1051
01:18:08,739 --> 01:18:11,491
Let's see. So... Ah.

1052
01:18:13,243 --> 01:18:15,450
Ammo?

1053
01:18:15,537 --> 01:18:17,446
I'm out.

1054
01:18:23,503 --> 01:18:25,496
Me too.

1055
01:18:30,260 --> 01:18:33,510
Rescue's not gonna be here in time.

1056
01:18:37,517 --> 01:18:38,548
No.

1057
01:18:46,192 --> 01:18:49,109
Get outta here. Get outta here. Go on.

1058
01:18:50,237 --> 01:18:52,230
No way.

1059
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:55,446
You can move. Climb down.

1060
01:18:55,534 --> 01:18:58,618
Not even if there was a ladder.

1061
01:19:09,839 --> 01:19:12,247
Not like this.

1062
01:19:13,051 --> 01:19:15,542
Not laying down.

1063
01:19:25,271 --> 01:19:27,263
Help me up.

1064
01:19:30,526 --> 01:19:32,518
Help me up.

1065
01:19:37,741 --> 01:19:40,279
Let's go.

1066
01:22:11,889 --> 01:22:13,300
- Hey.
- Hey, man.

1067
01:22:26,903 --> 01:22:30,023
You going to astronomy today?

1068
01:22:30,115 --> 01:22:32,570
JD's organising a Madden tourney.

1069
01:22:39,248 --> 01:22:44,669
- The fuck you doing up so early?
- Meeting with Malley.

1070
01:22:46,380 --> 01:22:50,248
Los Angeles affiliate KZDZ
is reporting that pop singer Fate

1071
01:22:50,342 --> 01:22:54,292
has this morning finally filed for divorce
from rapper husband Bully-Dog,

1072
01:22:54,388 --> 01:22:58,172
after Fate and Bully-Dog's now notorious
Pacific Rim tour last summer

1073
01:22:58,267 --> 01:23:01,018
when Fate was recorded
asking a Japanese reporter

1074
01:23:01,103 --> 01:23:04,269
how long the bus ride
from Tokyo to Beijing would be.

1075
01:23:04,356 --> 01:23:07,689
Up next we have our lead story...

1076
01:23:10,737 --> 01:23:13,987
What did you guys talk about?

1077
01:23:15,742 --> 01:23:16,691
Grades.

1078
01:23:19,704 --> 01:23:22,277
Is he failing you?

1079
01:23:24,876 --> 01:23:27,746
- He is failing you, isn't he?
- No, he's not failing me.

1080
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:36,294
What, do you already know
what you're getting?

1081
01:23:40,641 --> 01:23:43,132
You know what you're getting?
