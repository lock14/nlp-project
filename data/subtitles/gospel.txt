1
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,273
<i>Yeah!</i>

2
00:00:05,479 --> 00:00:08,107
Come on and stand up on your feet
and give God some praise.

3
00:00:16,623 --> 00:00:19,091
Get up! Get up! Get up! Get up!

4
00:00:54,795 --> 00:00:56,524
Come on.

5
00:01:04,304 --> 00:01:06,795
Come on. Get up on your feet.

6
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:09,338
Get up on your feet.

7
00:01:44,377 --> 00:01:46,072
Come on, sing it.

8
00:02:07,367 --> 00:02:09,460
Our God is an awesome God.

9
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:18,539
I'm so proud of you.

10
00:02:18,745 --> 00:02:21,771
Oh, the Lord is moving in here.

11
00:02:21,982 --> 00:02:25,418
The Lord is moving in here.

12
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:30,181
Now, I'm here to say
that the God I serve...

13
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,948
...is a awesome God.

14
00:02:32,592 --> 00:02:36,289
And I'm so happy
that the youth of the church...

15
00:02:36,496 --> 00:02:40,455
...are channeling their energies
into doing God's work.

16
00:02:42,402 --> 00:02:46,304
I wanna take a minute
to acknowledge two young men...

17
00:02:46,506 --> 00:02:49,964
...whose stars are shining
especially bright.

18
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:55,043
My son, David Taylor,
and his close friend, Charles Frank.

19
00:02:55,248 --> 00:02:58,445
Come on up here.
Come on up here, Frank.

20
00:02:58,652 --> 00:03:00,381
- Thank you, Jesus.
- Come on.

21
00:03:00,587 --> 00:03:06,253
These two wonderful young men
are one class shy...

22
00:03:06,459 --> 00:03:11,453
...of graduating from our
youth ministry training program...

23
00:03:11,665 --> 00:03:14,463
...and they're moving on
to becoming ministers.

24
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:18,268
- Amen. Amen.
- Hallelujah.

25
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,808
- Wanna swing by the mall later?
- I can't.

26
00:03:23,009 --> 00:03:25,341
My dad's in a meeting
and my mom's picking me up.

27
00:03:25,578 --> 00:03:28,274
Man, your cousin Charlene
is gonna be there.

28
00:03:28,481 --> 00:03:30,176
Now you trying to get at my cousin?

29
00:03:30,383 --> 00:03:32,749
She must be trying to get at me.

30
00:03:32,953 --> 00:03:34,750
She gave me her number.

31
00:03:34,955 --> 00:03:37,014
Let me see. Give me that, man.
What are you...?

32
00:03:37,223 --> 00:03:39,020
- Crazy?
- Minister Hunter.

33
00:03:39,225 --> 00:03:41,090
Can I speak to you for a minute?

34
00:03:41,294 --> 00:03:44,752
That ain't even the right number
anyway. It starts with a 404.

35
00:03:54,174 --> 00:03:56,005
- Lorraine Taylor?
- Room 201.

36
00:04:13,226 --> 00:04:15,126
Where's the father?

37
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:19,020
On his way back from a conference.

38
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,334
Dear Lord...

39
00:04:22,769 --> 00:04:25,602
...please don't let my mother die.

40
00:04:25,805 --> 00:04:28,706
She's done so much for people.

41
00:04:29,342 --> 00:04:32,175
And we need her here with us, Lord.

42
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:34,404
I'd do anything you ask.

43
00:04:34,614 --> 00:04:36,275
Anything.

44
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:37,848
Please.

45
00:04:50,964 --> 00:04:52,625
I love you.

46
00:04:54,834 --> 00:04:56,096
- Ernestine.
- Bishop.

47
00:04:56,302 --> 00:04:58,327
I got here as soon as I could.
Is she okay?

48
00:04:58,538 --> 00:05:02,599
- Let me... No, I'm so sorry.
- Ernestine.

49
00:05:03,176 --> 00:05:05,007
She's gone.

50
00:05:05,211 --> 00:05:06,610
Ernestine, no.

51
00:05:06,813 --> 00:05:09,373
But before you go in the room,
I need to talk to you.

52
00:05:09,582 --> 00:05:11,174
I just need to go in and see her.

53
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,815
- Let me just go in and see her.
- No, bishop, please.

54
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:16,454
- Let me go in and see her.
- What's he doing here?

55
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,227
- Son, I'm sorry.
- No. My mother's already gone.

56
00:05:22,429 --> 00:05:24,795
- It's too late now.
- David.

57
00:05:24,998 --> 00:05:27,466
She died and you were away
with the church like always.

58
00:05:27,967 --> 00:05:29,662
Son.

59
00:05:31,171 --> 00:05:34,868
- There are things parents need to...
- Get off of me. I hate you!

60
00:05:38,545 --> 00:05:40,342
Ernestine.

61
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,147
David.

62
00:05:42,348 --> 00:05:44,179
David.

63
00:07:35,061 --> 00:07:39,327
<i>D. T.! D. T.! D. T.! D. T.!</i>

64
00:07:49,309 --> 00:07:51,777
You did your thing out there, man.
That's what it do.

65
00:07:51,978 --> 00:07:55,175
What did I say? Rip the shirt off.
See how they fell all over the place?

66
00:07:55,381 --> 00:07:57,747
- That's what I'm talking about.
- God!

67
00:07:57,951 --> 00:08:00,215
- And I'm just getting started, huh?
- I know this.

68
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,945
In six months, David Taylor's
gonna be a household name.

69
00:08:03,156 --> 00:08:05,283
That's what I've been
telling you, boy.

70
00:08:15,468 --> 00:08:17,493
Hey, man, you packing clubs
like a superstar.

71
00:08:17,704 --> 00:08:19,228
Selling records like a superstar.

72
00:08:19,439 --> 00:08:22,033
- Now I want dollars like a superstar.
- Superstar.

73
00:08:22,242 --> 00:08:24,472
Yo, Dave. What up?

74
00:08:24,677 --> 00:08:26,577
I gotta buy tickets
to holler at you now?

75
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:28,246
- Something you need, Stone?
- No.

76
00:08:28,448 --> 00:08:31,940
I'm trying to holler at the man
I helped make a superstar. It's all chill.

77
00:08:32,151 --> 00:08:34,619
But he's still gotta holler at me
about that contract.

78
00:08:34,821 --> 00:08:36,914
Look, man, you're drunk.
I got nothing to say.

79
00:08:37,123 --> 00:08:39,387
- You got nothing to say to me?
- Are you deaf?

80
00:08:39,592 --> 00:08:41,219
I got something to say to you!

81
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:43,895
D! D!

82
00:08:44,097 --> 00:08:45,997
Where's security at?

83
00:08:46,499 --> 00:08:50,128
- It's over, man, it's over.
- What's up? Get off of me.

84
00:08:51,604 --> 00:08:53,265
You want some more of this? What?

85
00:08:55,008 --> 00:08:57,875
- Take him home.
- Get him out of here, boy.

86
00:08:58,077 --> 00:08:59,874
- What is wrong with that guy?
- It's cool.

87
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:01,478
- I put him on!
- I know. Ignorant.

88
00:09:01,714 --> 00:09:03,614
It's all good.

89
00:09:04,784 --> 00:09:07,116
- Relax.
- I put him on a hit record.

90
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:10,255
Don't let him spoil our night.
Know what I'm saying? In fact...

91
00:09:10,456 --> 00:09:13,482
...I got a couple dime brizzles
picked out just for you, baby.

92
00:09:13,693 --> 00:09:15,058
Look at them right there.

93
00:09:15,261 --> 00:09:17,354
- That's why you're my manager.
- Yes, sir.

94
00:09:17,563 --> 00:09:20,259
- Wesley said it, and it shall be done.
- And it shall be done.

95
00:09:20,466 --> 00:09:23,333
Yes, sir. Yo, let's mix some drinks
up in here, baby.

96
00:09:28,908 --> 00:09:33,277
Last quarter, New Revelations'
attendance was down 18 percent.

97
00:09:33,479 --> 00:09:35,674
Well, that may be true
on the surface...

98
00:09:35,882 --> 00:09:38,680
...but if you'll look at the
quarterly report, you'll see...

99
00:09:38,885 --> 00:09:43,151
...that the 18-percent drop has not
affected our primary financial base.

100
00:09:43,356 --> 00:09:45,790
You can pay the mortgage,
utilities and payroll...

101
00:09:45,992 --> 00:09:47,823
...but there's no room
for renovations.

102
00:09:48,494 --> 00:09:51,827
And it's put an additional burden
on your core congregation.

103
00:09:52,031 --> 00:09:54,659
I think our congregation
is in a better position...

104
00:09:54,867 --> 00:09:56,732
...to tell us what's a burden to them.

105
00:09:56,936 --> 00:09:58,961
Where are you going to get
money for supplies?

106
00:09:59,172 --> 00:10:01,367
That's the reason
we're asking for your help.

107
00:10:01,574 --> 00:10:05,533
Give us a few days. I'll take it under
advisement, and we'll contact you.

108
00:10:05,745 --> 00:10:07,906
Henry, that won't be necessary.

109
00:10:08,114 --> 00:10:09,979
They're giving us a few days.

110
00:10:10,183 --> 00:10:13,482
Bishop Stackhouse has something
he needs to tell us.

111
00:10:14,520 --> 00:10:17,182
And you're not gonna
leave here until you do, Henry.

112
00:10:18,324 --> 00:10:19,848
We go back, Fred.

113
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:21,856
Obviously, we don't
go back far enough.

114
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:25,861
This is not about friendship.
It's about what's practical.

115
00:10:26,065 --> 00:10:28,533
And what exactly does that mean?

116
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,862
It means you've got 30 days.

117
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:34,335
If you've got a thriving congregation,
then you've got our support.

118
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:38,032
But what you need to do
is put yourself in a mental state...

119
00:10:38,244 --> 00:10:42,010
...where you can tell your congregation
that you're gonna be closing down.

120
00:10:42,215 --> 00:10:45,878
This is my life's work, Henry,
and you know that.

121
00:10:46,085 --> 00:10:49,782
- It's bigger than you.
- But it's not bigger than God.

122
00:10:49,989 --> 00:10:52,253
Let me tell you something, Henry.
I won't let you.

123
00:10:52,458 --> 00:10:55,450
- You what?
- I wont let you!

124
00:10:57,263 --> 00:10:58,992
Call 911.

125
00:11:12,445 --> 00:11:14,811
Answer your phone.

126
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:25,814
What's up?

127
00:11:27,393 --> 00:11:29,861
Hey, Miss Ernestine.

128
00:11:30,763 --> 00:11:34,130
No, I'm good. What's going on?

129
00:11:35,134 --> 00:11:36,897
Yeah.

130
00:11:37,103 --> 00:11:39,435
No, tomorrow's the last show.

131
00:11:40,473 --> 00:11:41,963
What?

132
00:11:42,175 --> 00:11:43,870
Slow down.

133
00:11:55,655 --> 00:11:58,715
Oh, boy. What about him?

134
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:05,329
What? When?

135
00:12:08,968 --> 00:12:10,367
Well...

136
00:12:13,706 --> 00:12:15,936
Yeah, well, all right. Can l...?

137
00:12:16,142 --> 00:12:17,700
Let me call you back.

138
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,502
All right.

139
00:12:25,952 --> 00:12:28,580
See? Now, that's the reason
I got into this business.

140
00:12:28,788 --> 00:12:31,052
The dime brizzles.

141
00:12:31,324 --> 00:12:32,655
And I be working for you, D.

142
00:12:32,859 --> 00:12:35,521
Making moves, miracles
and dreams come true.

143
00:12:35,728 --> 00:12:37,889
Talked to Phil Fishman
three times this a.m.

144
00:12:38,097 --> 00:12:40,759
<i>He started out with that same old
Little Orphan Annie spiel.</i>

145
00:12:40,967 --> 00:12:42,491
I put the brother on front street.

146
00:12:42,702 --> 00:12:44,966
Let him know I'm not new to this,
I'm true to this.

147
00:12:45,171 --> 00:12:47,833
- Brother's gotta get paid, you know?
- Yeah, that's good.

148
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:50,304
"Yeah, that's good"?

149
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:52,978
That's not the response
when your man tells you...

150
00:12:53,179 --> 00:12:56,706
...he just broke his foot off into
somebody's hind parts on your behalf.

151
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:58,975
What's really going on?

152
00:13:01,921 --> 00:13:03,616
My old man...

153
00:13:04,757 --> 00:13:06,520
...he's sick.

154
00:13:06,726 --> 00:13:07,920
Damn.

155
00:13:08,294 --> 00:13:10,194
I'm real sorry to hear that, dog.

156
00:13:10,396 --> 00:13:12,523
- Is it serious?
- I don't know.

157
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:16,427
I think I'm gonna have to
go home for a minute.

158
00:13:16,636 --> 00:13:18,069
For sure.

159
00:13:18,271 --> 00:13:20,501
Absolutely, man.
It's the right thing to do.

160
00:13:20,706 --> 00:13:22,731
Spend time with pops,
make sure he's straight.

161
00:13:22,942 --> 00:13:26,503
Don't worry about nothing. I'll work out
this thing with Sandstone...

162
00:13:26,712 --> 00:13:29,772
...set up the deal with the promoter
and fly down there to meet you.

163
00:13:29,982 --> 00:13:31,574
All right? It's gonna be all good.

164
00:13:31,784 --> 00:13:34,582
Wesley said it, and it shall be done.

165
00:13:38,224 --> 00:13:40,818
<i>The temperature tonight
is in the upper 40s...</i>

166
00:13:41,027 --> 00:13:43,052
<i>... with a high tomorrow
of 65 degrees.</i>

167
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,219
- Frank?
- Oh, hold on, baby.

168
00:14:09,422 --> 00:14:12,050
<i>- Join us Sunday mornings at 9...
- I don't want to miss this.</i>

169
00:14:12,258 --> 00:14:15,591
<i>... for the hour of Divine Gospel
led by Reverend Isaac Winston...</i>

170
00:14:15,795 --> 00:14:17,558
<i>- Frank.
- ... of Divine Soul Ministries...</i>

171
00:14:17,763 --> 00:14:19,390
<i>... right here.</i>

172
00:14:20,266 --> 00:14:21,631
That's what I'm talking about.

173
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:27,067
You feel like the hand of God
just came in and touched you.

174
00:14:27,273 --> 00:14:29,298
You know what I mean, baby?

175
00:14:30,876 --> 00:14:32,639
Charlene?

176
00:14:41,087 --> 00:14:44,955
I came down to say
good night to you.

177
00:14:45,157 --> 00:14:47,318
I know. I know. I was...

178
00:14:47,526 --> 00:14:51,121
You were just watching
Divine Souls Ministries' commercial.

179
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,697
You gotta give it to them.
They doing it way big.

180
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,460
Radio, TV, on the front covers
of magazines.

181
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:02,300
They're like the all-stars
of the gospel game.

182
00:15:02,775 --> 00:15:04,538
You will be too.

183
00:15:05,911 --> 00:15:09,779
- How's your sermon coming?
- Oh, it's good, you know.

184
00:15:09,982 --> 00:15:12,246
I worked on it all morning.

185
00:15:12,451 --> 00:15:15,215
I'll work on it all night
if that's what it takes.

186
00:15:15,888 --> 00:15:17,856
You nervous about tomorrow?

187
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,122
I don't know.

188
00:15:22,294 --> 00:15:25,661
On one hand, it's like I've been waiting
for this moment my whole life...

189
00:15:25,865 --> 00:15:29,357
...but on the other hand...

190
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:33,696
...if it means Bishop Taylor's
gonna have to die for me to get it...

191
00:15:33,906 --> 00:15:35,373
...then I'll pass.

192
00:15:35,908 --> 00:15:38,775
But it was just a minor attack.

193
00:15:40,713 --> 00:15:43,307
He'll be back
at the church tomorrow.

194
00:15:44,417 --> 00:15:46,078
Yeah.

195
00:15:49,655 --> 00:15:51,680
You're so beautiful, baby.

196
00:15:53,259 --> 00:15:55,227
Thank you.

197
00:16:10,176 --> 00:16:11,973
I can't.

198
00:16:12,344 --> 00:16:14,403
Baby, it's been a long time.

199
00:16:14,613 --> 00:16:17,138
- I know, but I'm just...
- But you're tired.

200
00:16:17,349 --> 00:16:20,216
You're tired. Lord...

201
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:24,751
...help me. I'm a patient man.

202
00:16:25,191 --> 00:16:29,218
It's part of what makes me
a good minister, I guess...

203
00:16:29,662 --> 00:16:31,892
...but, Charlene...

204
00:16:32,765 --> 00:16:35,290
...you ain't the congregation.

205
00:16:36,869 --> 00:16:38,427
You're my wife.

206
00:17:39,865 --> 00:17:42,026
Yeah. Yeah.

207
00:17:42,234 --> 00:17:43,895
Thank you.

208
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:49,639
Now, before I take my seat...

209
00:17:49,842 --> 00:17:54,779
...I want y'all to rejoice
in the blessings from God.

210
00:17:57,149 --> 00:17:59,310
- Amen?
- Amen.

211
00:18:01,353 --> 00:18:03,150
Don't be ashamed, you know.

212
00:18:03,355 --> 00:18:05,949
If God blesses you
with the money to buy that car...

213
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:09,585
...and that ice and that bling,
then that's all right.

214
00:18:09,795 --> 00:18:11,319
That's all right.

215
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:16,229
But in rejoicing, I want you to always
acknowledge where it came from.

216
00:18:16,435 --> 00:18:18,630
Amen? Hallelujah.

217
00:18:19,338 --> 00:18:21,067
All right.

218
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,184
The Minister Frank.

219
00:18:33,385 --> 00:18:34,579
Charles Frank.

220
00:18:34,787 --> 00:18:36,914
I've been watching him
since he was a little boy.

221
00:18:37,122 --> 00:18:40,353
Reverend Charles Frank. Let's just
give him one more hallelujah.

222
00:18:44,797 --> 00:18:50,997
As the choir starts to sing, we gonna
invite y'all to come up to the altar.

223
00:18:59,945 --> 00:19:03,403
You know, sometimes
we lose our way.

224
00:19:05,451 --> 00:19:09,353
Sometimes we struggle
with our faith.

225
00:19:13,092 --> 00:19:15,993
But if you put your faith in God...

226
00:19:18,063 --> 00:19:19,860
...you can't go wrong.

227
00:19:22,368 --> 00:19:26,566
If you're looking for a church home,
come on and join our family.

228
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,537
There's no such thing
as a perfect church.

229
00:19:31,911 --> 00:19:37,577
But I'm here to tell you,
there is a perfect God.

230
00:19:38,784 --> 00:19:43,084
Now, as the new saints
turn and face the congregation...

231
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:46,383
...the congregation has something
they wanna tell you.

232
00:19:46,592 --> 00:19:48,753
Welcome home!

233
00:19:49,762 --> 00:19:53,755
And that's what we say when you
join our church. Welcome home.

234
00:19:59,805 --> 00:20:01,397
This is big. I worked it out.

235
00:20:01,607 --> 00:20:04,201
The Reverend Isaac Winston
wants to meet you.

236
00:20:04,410 --> 00:20:07,573
I'm serious. Apparently he's heard
some great things about you.

237
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,907
As soon as he gets
a break in his schedule...

238
00:20:10,115 --> 00:20:12,310
...he wants to take you to lunch.
- That's big.

239
00:20:12,518 --> 00:20:15,612
This is big. This is what we've been
waiting for. You're on the way.

240
00:20:15,821 --> 00:20:17,789
- I'll see you in a little bit.
- All right.

241
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,220
Excuse me. You're David Taylor,
aren't you?

242
00:20:20,426 --> 00:20:23,054
- Yeah.
- Told you.

243
00:20:24,129 --> 00:20:27,098
It's great that you still come by
the church when you're in town.

244
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:29,062
No one's supposed
to know I'm here.

245
00:20:29,268 --> 00:20:31,702
- It's a surprise for my father.
- Well, good for him.

246
00:20:31,904 --> 00:20:35,601
I know I'd be surprised if I came home
and found you in my living room...

247
00:20:36,408 --> 00:20:40,469
...singing your song
"Let Me Undress You."

248
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:42,806
I'd be happy and both surprised
at the same time.

249
00:20:43,015 --> 00:20:46,314
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- All right, now, ladies, come on, now.

250
00:20:46,518 --> 00:20:49,351
Let the man be.
He came to hear the word of God...

251
00:20:49,588 --> 00:20:53,581
...not be put on the spot.
- Okay. Well, David...

252
00:20:53,792 --> 00:20:56,317
...it was nice meeting you.
- Nice to meet you.

253
00:20:57,363 --> 00:20:59,354
Where your Bible at?

254
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,324
You still got the gift of gab, I see.

255
00:21:03,535 --> 00:21:06,595
Well, you know. I try to be
of service to those in need.

256
00:21:06,805 --> 00:21:09,000
- Right.
- You look good, though, man.

257
00:21:09,208 --> 00:21:12,371
I mean, you look real good. It's good
to have you back in the church.

258
00:21:12,778 --> 00:21:16,737
Help offset that bumping and grinding
you've been doing in them videos.

259
00:21:16,949 --> 00:21:18,849
- Hey, cousin.
- Hey, cousin.

260
00:21:20,886 --> 00:21:22,547
- How you doing?
- I'm good, David.

261
00:21:23,522 --> 00:21:25,217
- Good to see you.
- Good to see you too.

262
00:21:25,424 --> 00:21:28,860
- When did you get here?
- This morning. Came right to church.

263
00:21:29,061 --> 00:21:30,961
I knew y'all would be
doing your thing here.

264
00:21:31,397 --> 00:21:33,991
Yeah, we are.
Does the bishop know you're here?

265
00:21:34,199 --> 00:21:36,827
Not yet. No, I'm gonna go up
and surprise him now.

266
00:21:37,036 --> 00:21:39,869
- Okay.
- Baby, we gotta go so we can...

267
00:21:40,072 --> 00:21:42,836
Yeah, we do. Well, how long
are you gonna be here?

268
00:21:43,042 --> 00:21:45,374
- A couple days, maybe a week.
- You're not going...

269
00:21:45,577 --> 00:21:47,511
...without having dinner
with Frank and me.

270
00:21:47,713 --> 00:21:50,181
- Okay, no doubt. Yeah.
- Okay?

271
00:21:50,382 --> 00:21:52,543
- All right, Frankie.
- All right, David.

272
00:21:52,751 --> 00:21:55,083
- Take care, man. All right.
- Love you. All right.

273
00:21:58,323 --> 00:21:59,458
I printed out directions
and a map for your trip.

274
00:21:59,558 --> 00:22:01,992
I printed out directions
and a map for your trip.

275
00:22:02,361 --> 00:22:05,853
I know where I'm going, Ernestine,
and I'm gonna be okay.

276
00:22:06,065 --> 00:22:09,159
When you get lost, I'll be sure
to refer to this conversation.

277
00:22:10,969 --> 00:22:12,527
Come in.

278
00:22:26,819 --> 00:22:28,650
I'm good.

279
00:22:29,154 --> 00:22:31,384
Give your father a hug, son.

280
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:35,950
How you doing?

281
00:22:37,729 --> 00:22:39,720
I guess I'll leave you two alone.

282
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:43,365
I'm so glad you came.

283
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:46,064
Me too.

284
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,030
It's good to see you.

285
00:22:49,508 --> 00:22:50,941
Yep.

286
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,778
And you're back in the church.

287
00:22:54,179 --> 00:22:56,272
The Lord never ceases
to amaze me.

288
00:22:56,815 --> 00:23:00,410
Yeah, Frank, he preached
a good sermon today.

289
00:23:00,619 --> 00:23:05,318
Yeah, he's developing
into a real fine minister.

290
00:23:06,191 --> 00:23:07,590
Good for him.

291
00:23:07,793 --> 00:23:09,158
So, what brings you here, son?

292
00:23:09,361 --> 00:23:11,158
You got another concert
or something?

293
00:23:12,364 --> 00:23:16,300
Miss Ernestine called me.
She said you weren't feeling well.

294
00:23:19,238 --> 00:23:22,969
Now, I told her you were a busy man,
and I wish she hadn't done that.

295
00:23:23,175 --> 00:23:27,669
Dad, I'm not too busy to wanna know
whether or not you're okay.

296
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:32,249
You know, I left your room
just like you had it.

297
00:23:32,885 --> 00:23:34,318
Look...

298
00:23:34,887 --> 00:23:37,685
...what's going on? Seriously.

299
00:23:42,528 --> 00:23:44,519
I have...

300
00:23:45,764 --> 00:23:47,664
I've got prostate cancer.

301
00:24:06,518 --> 00:24:08,383
So how long have you known?

302
00:24:09,621 --> 00:24:12,283
I've known for a while now.

303
00:24:14,793 --> 00:24:17,921
I haven't shared it
with too many folks.

304
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:21,122
You know, these things
have a way of getting out.

305
00:24:21,333 --> 00:24:24,734
- How many people know?
- Well, Ernestine, of course.

306
00:24:24,937 --> 00:24:26,700
Minister Hunter.

307
00:24:26,905 --> 00:24:30,739
- Frank and your cousin Charlene.
- Frank.

308
00:24:30,943 --> 00:24:32,433
Yeah.

309
00:24:35,781 --> 00:24:37,840
And you weren't gonna tell me?

310
00:24:38,784 --> 00:24:40,684
Son, it's complicated.

311
00:24:41,887 --> 00:24:47,689
I am going to be stepping down
as the church's bishop.

312
00:24:52,598 --> 00:24:53,758
- Hey.
- Yeah.

313
00:24:53,966 --> 00:24:55,433
Now, was it just me...

314
00:24:56,268 --> 00:24:59,101
...or David didn't seem like he
wanted to be in church today?

315
00:24:59,304 --> 00:25:01,465
Well, Miss Ernestine called him
and he came.

316
00:25:01,673 --> 00:25:04,506
Miss Ernestine called?
Not Bishop Taylor?

317
00:25:05,611 --> 00:25:06,873
My uncle's a minister...

318
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:10,981
...but he can't get beyond the worst
of the seven deadly sins.

319
00:25:11,783 --> 00:25:13,375
- Pride.
- There you go.

320
00:25:13,585 --> 00:25:15,348
I don't know,
it just seemed awkward...

321
00:25:15,554 --> 00:25:18,455
...having David Taylor
at the church today.

322
00:25:18,924 --> 00:25:21,654
- Don't do that, Frank. Please?
- What?

323
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:24,021
Don't talk about my cousin
like he's other people.

324
00:25:24,229 --> 00:25:27,096
I'm saying, spiritually,
we don't know where David's been...

325
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:29,961
...or what he's been up to.
Am I not saying it right?

326
00:25:30,168 --> 00:25:31,635
No, you're saying it perfect.

327
00:25:31,837 --> 00:25:33,532
- Oh, come on.
- It's coming out great.

328
00:25:35,173 --> 00:25:36,834
We got enough problems
on our plate...

329
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:40,034
...without adding David
to the equation, that's for sure.

330
00:25:41,546 --> 00:25:44,344
Well, I go see Dr. Morris tomorrow.

331
00:25:44,549 --> 00:25:46,176
Amen.

332
00:25:46,385 --> 00:25:47,977
That's encouraging.

333
00:25:48,186 --> 00:25:50,154
Well, we'll see what happens.

334
00:25:50,355 --> 00:25:53,722
Sure would be nice to have
the loving part of our marriage back.

335
00:25:55,527 --> 00:25:58,928
Yeah. Sure would be nice.

336
00:26:06,605 --> 00:26:09,768
- Hey.
- Hey, bishop. Good to see you.

337
00:26:09,975 --> 00:26:11,840
We brought you
some boxes of clothes.

338
00:26:12,044 --> 00:26:13,671
We got some more
out in the hallway.

339
00:26:13,879 --> 00:26:17,610
I appreciate that, Bishop Taylor.
We'll take care of that for you.

340
00:26:17,816 --> 00:26:19,613
It's good to see you, bishop.

341
00:26:20,052 --> 00:26:22,885
Hey. I should've known.

342
00:26:23,088 --> 00:26:24,646
It's you.
Hey, man, good to meet you.

343
00:26:24,856 --> 00:26:27,017
- Good to meet you.
- Yeah. That's cool.

344
00:26:30,095 --> 00:26:32,962
You got a lot of influence
over people.

345
00:26:33,899 --> 00:26:36,527
Maybe you ought to work
with the choir while you're here.

346
00:26:36,735 --> 00:26:39,727
Dad, look, I came to see about you,
all right? Not the church.

347
00:26:40,138 --> 00:26:43,130
Well, maybe you don't realize
they're one and the same.

348
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:47,675
Yeah. That's always been
the problem between you and I.

349
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:57,684
Look, I'm gonna go and see
one of my friends. I'll be back.

350
00:26:57,889 --> 00:27:01,484
Well, we're gonna be ready
to give you a grand sendoff.

351
00:27:01,693 --> 00:27:03,490
Yeah. It's good to see you.

352
00:27:03,695 --> 00:27:05,560
You know, that is a great man.

353
00:27:05,764 --> 00:27:08,324
He comes here twice a week,
every week.

354
00:27:08,533 --> 00:27:10,364
I don't know where
he finds the time.

355
00:27:10,569 --> 00:27:12,833
Yeah, he's been that way
ever since I was a kid.

356
00:27:13,038 --> 00:27:15,063
I know he's proud of you.

357
00:27:15,707 --> 00:27:17,834
Hey, it was nice to meet you, man.

358
00:27:23,448 --> 00:27:25,279
<i>Look, my client acted
on good faith...</i>

359
00:27:25,484 --> 00:27:27,418
<i>... assuming things
would be negotiable...</i>

360
00:27:27,619 --> 00:27:29,712
<i>... which is why he refused
to sign the contract.</i>

361
00:27:29,921 --> 00:27:31,411
Look, Sandstone.

362
00:27:31,623 --> 00:27:34,524
<i>You agreed to the deal, and you
can't just change the terms now...</i>

363
00:27:34,726 --> 00:27:37,524
<i>- ... because the song's a hit.
- It was a bad deal from the jump.</i>

364
00:27:37,729 --> 00:27:40,254
With the cash that song made,
I'm supposed to get more.

365
00:27:40,465 --> 00:27:42,729
"It was a bad deal."
You know what, I took the risk.

366
00:27:42,934 --> 00:27:45,300
If the song was a bust,
I'd be left holding the bag.

367
00:27:45,504 --> 00:27:48,268
My client should also be guaranteed
that two of his tracks...

368
00:27:48,473 --> 00:27:50,464
...appear on the next
David Taylor album.

369
00:27:50,675 --> 00:27:53,200
Hold on. You know what?
You can have my answer right now.

370
00:27:53,412 --> 00:27:56,210
You get nothing.
No track, no money.

371
00:27:56,415 --> 00:27:59,213
Wanna take me to court? Go ahead.
It'll be a cold day in hell...

372
00:27:59,418 --> 00:28:02,819
...before I let a chump like you
extort money from me.

373
00:28:06,057 --> 00:28:08,491
So that went well.

374
00:29:15,227 --> 00:29:17,457
- Hey. Hey, Reverend.
- Bishop.

375
00:29:17,662 --> 00:29:20,028
- How you doing?
- Man, how you doing?

376
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,495
- I'm doing great.
- Good to see you.

377
00:29:23,702 --> 00:29:25,761
Look, I'm glad you're a little early.

378
00:29:25,971 --> 00:29:28,064
There are a few things
I wanna talk to you about.

379
00:29:28,273 --> 00:29:29,706
No problem. What's going on?

380
00:29:29,908 --> 00:29:33,435
You know, minister, I don't know
how much time I've got left.

381
00:29:34,246 --> 00:29:36,714
And I think it's about time
I choose a successor.

382
00:29:36,915 --> 00:29:39,213
I agree. I agree totally.

383
00:29:39,417 --> 00:29:42,648
That's why I'm gonna choose Frank
when I step down.

384
00:29:43,455 --> 00:29:46,618
- Frank?
- Yeah.

385
00:29:47,259 --> 00:29:50,092
Look, with all due respect, sir...

386
00:29:50,295 --> 00:29:52,320
...I just always thought,
when the time came...

387
00:29:52,531 --> 00:29:55,159
...that you'd pass the baton to me.

388
00:29:58,403 --> 00:30:01,930
You know, minister, you've been
a great administrator for this church...

389
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,438
...and you've been a good friend.

390
00:30:04,809 --> 00:30:07,676
And I expect you
to do the same for Frank.

391
00:30:09,214 --> 00:30:12,149
We're just gonna leave this
in God's hands.

392
00:30:14,219 --> 00:30:17,780
Come on, now.
It's gonna be all right.

393
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:39,101
<i>We're living in a brave new world.
We're competing against tabloids...</i>

394
00:30:39,311 --> 00:30:42,508
<i>... rappers, music videos,
basketball players, Internet.</i>

395
00:30:42,714 --> 00:30:46,081
<i>People are seeking guidance
from everywhere outside the church.</i>

396
00:30:46,284 --> 00:30:49,776
Now, if we don't step up our game,
we're gonna get left behind.

397
00:30:49,988 --> 00:30:51,979
We can't preach prosperity
and blessing...

398
00:30:52,190 --> 00:30:55,523
...when we ain't looking the part.
That's not gonna fly.

399
00:30:57,429 --> 00:30:59,420
I'm sorry, I didn't know
you were meeting.

400
00:30:59,631 --> 00:31:01,326
- Come in, have a seat.
- I'll come back.

401
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:02,795
- No, no, no.
- You sure?

402
00:31:03,001 --> 00:31:04,730
We all like family here.

403
00:31:04,936 --> 00:31:06,733
You were saying, Frank?

404
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:12,874
We done made our repairs.
The roof, plumbing, the transformer.

405
00:31:13,078 --> 00:31:16,070
You know, I believe in maintenance,
but this here is ridiculous.

406
00:31:16,281 --> 00:31:19,182
Now, we need a new church.
A new church.

407
00:31:19,384 --> 00:31:22,751
- But we've been here for years.
- A new facility would be nice.

408
00:31:22,954 --> 00:31:25,115
- Yeah.
- The board of churches...

409
00:31:25,323 --> 00:31:28,884
...has already denied us funds
to do repairs in this church.

410
00:31:29,094 --> 00:31:31,187
What makes you think
they gonna give us money...

411
00:31:31,396 --> 00:31:33,455
...to build a new church, Frank?

412
00:31:33,965 --> 00:31:38,026
Besides, this church right here
has been a historical pillar...

413
00:31:38,236 --> 00:31:42,263
...of strength in this community
for as long as I can remember.

414
00:31:42,941 --> 00:31:46,968
I'm sorry, Bishop Taylor, but you see.
It's like the Lord himself saying:

415
00:31:47,178 --> 00:31:49,169
"If y'all won't erect
a brand-new church...

416
00:31:49,381 --> 00:31:51,975
...I'm gonna take this one down."

417
00:31:56,354 --> 00:31:58,413
So, what do you propose, Frank?

418
00:31:59,057 --> 00:32:03,289
Minister Hunter here could get us
a great low-interest loan, right?

419
00:32:03,495 --> 00:32:06,589
But we gonna need
the down payment...

420
00:32:06,798 --> 00:32:08,857
- And how much?
...in a few weeks.

421
00:32:09,701 --> 00:32:11,362
About 150,000.

422
00:32:14,005 --> 00:32:15,836
Assuming that
this thing is feasible...

423
00:32:16,041 --> 00:32:18,475
...how soon can we come up
with a down payment?

424
00:32:18,677 --> 00:32:22,807
- The repairs have depleted all of our...
- I got an idea. Sorry.

425
00:32:23,014 --> 00:32:25,812
Why don't we just ask David
to cover the shortfall.

426
00:32:27,252 --> 00:32:28,583
Then we'll pay him back.

427
00:32:28,787 --> 00:32:30,584
- David?
- Right?

428
00:32:31,923 --> 00:32:36,121
Wow, that's a great idea, yeah.
I mean...

429
00:32:36,327 --> 00:32:38,761
I got a better idea, though.

430
00:32:38,963 --> 00:32:42,126
What if I just call in some favors...

431
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:46,565
...with my artist friends and we'll have
a concert and raise the funds?

432
00:32:46,938 --> 00:32:49,236
- Like a revival.
- Exactly. Yeah.

433
00:32:49,441 --> 00:32:52,899
I mean, it's great for them because
most of them are spiritual anyways.

434
00:32:53,111 --> 00:32:57,104
Right? And then the publicity will help
bring new members to the church.

435
00:32:57,315 --> 00:33:00,944
Yeah, we could also make it part of
Bishop Taylor's retirement celebration.

436
00:33:01,152 --> 00:33:04,212
Use it as a way
to salute in a new legacy.

437
00:33:04,422 --> 00:33:06,890
- I like it.
- I like it.

438
00:33:08,259 --> 00:33:11,524
Now, assuming, David, you could
help me out with the choir.

439
00:33:12,664 --> 00:33:16,259
Oh, but, Dad, my quota's
one great idea a day.

440
00:33:17,302 --> 00:33:20,567
I think David has exhausted
himself a little bit.

441
00:34:01,446 --> 00:34:05,678
Hold it up, y'all. Hold it up. Everybody,
I'm sure you know David "D.T." Taylor.

442
00:34:05,884 --> 00:34:07,181
This is Bishop's son.

443
00:34:07,385 --> 00:34:11,082
But what you don't know, he got
his start right here in this choir.

444
00:34:11,289 --> 00:34:13,814
- Yep.
- He stopped by to give us a few words.

445
00:34:14,025 --> 00:34:16,459
- Oh, no, no.
- Come on, man. Let's give it up.

446
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:24,135
Stop, stop, stop.

447
00:34:25,036 --> 00:34:27,504
Watching you guys sing
is really something.

448
00:34:27,705 --> 00:34:29,764
I have one suggestion, though.

449
00:34:29,974 --> 00:34:31,965
- Just an idea.
- Sure, by all means.

450
00:34:32,644 --> 00:34:36,512
Opposed to starting with the solo,
go with the alto section first.

451
00:34:36,714 --> 00:34:38,511
And then the tenors and the bass...

452
00:34:38,716 --> 00:34:41,879
...and then maybe
the solo or something.

453
00:34:42,854 --> 00:34:44,651
- Let's do it your way.
- I don't know.

454
00:34:44,856 --> 00:34:47,450
All right. Oh, okay, cool.
All right, ready?

455
00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:02,897
We ran late, but I'm on my way.

456
00:35:03,107 --> 00:35:06,702
- Hey. So how did you like the new...?
- I have a phone to my ear.

457
00:35:06,911 --> 00:35:08,936
What do you think that means?

458
00:35:09,414 --> 00:35:11,939
Give me 30 minutes? Okay.

459
00:35:12,817 --> 00:35:14,751
You were saying?

460
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,718
Only that I hope you like
the changes that we made.

461
00:35:17,922 --> 00:35:20,720
They were good changes.
I was kind of impressed...

462
00:35:20,925 --> 00:35:24,691
...Mr. "Undress You" Man by night
and servant to the Lord by day.

463
00:35:24,896 --> 00:35:26,454
Servant...?

464
00:35:37,876 --> 00:35:40,436
Okay, okay. Hold on, hold on.

465
00:35:40,645 --> 00:35:42,875
So is that how you operate?

466
00:35:43,081 --> 00:35:46,539
A few snide comments and you just
vanish without a trace or a name?

467
00:35:47,252 --> 00:35:48,446
It's Rain.

468
00:35:49,454 --> 00:35:52,651
- Rain. Well, that's cute.
- Cute?

469
00:35:52,857 --> 00:35:55,087
You headed somewhere specific?
Wanna grab a bite?

470
00:35:55,293 --> 00:35:58,456
- That is, if your man is cool with it.
- Excuse me?

471
00:36:18,416 --> 00:36:21,283
- Well, I see you've met my niece.
- Oh, Minister Hunter, yes.

472
00:36:21,486 --> 00:36:24,546
Hey, Uncle.
We've gotta go pick up Alexis.

473
00:36:24,756 --> 00:36:28,089
- Right. Catch you later, David.
- Okay, take it easy. Good to see you.

474
00:36:28,293 --> 00:36:29,692
All right.

475
00:36:35,433 --> 00:36:38,459
I heard Brother Gordon invited you
to sing with the choir.

476
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:41,002
Yeah, we talked about it.

477
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:47,039
Hey, Frank.

478
00:36:49,814 --> 00:36:51,975
How long did you know
about my father?

479
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,012
Well...

480
00:36:54,218 --> 00:36:57,676
...he told me shortly after
he was diagnosed.

481
00:36:57,889 --> 00:36:59,823
How come you didn't call me?

482
00:37:00,024 --> 00:37:02,151
I didn't feel it was
my responsibility...

483
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,658
...to tell you about your own father.

484
00:37:06,064 --> 00:37:07,656
You know...

485
00:37:08,967 --> 00:37:10,525
No.

486
00:37:11,035 --> 00:37:13,060
Wait till Sunday.

487
00:37:13,671 --> 00:37:16,071
You're gonna love my performance.

488
00:37:18,509 --> 00:37:20,306
All right, now.

489
00:37:24,048 --> 00:37:27,449
I'm a little concerned
about David, sir.

490
00:37:28,586 --> 00:37:30,144
- Why so?
- Don't get me wrong.

491
00:37:30,355 --> 00:37:33,051
I'm thrilled to have him back
at the church...

492
00:37:33,257 --> 00:37:37,057
...but I was a little surprised at his
involvement in the board meeting.

493
00:37:39,564 --> 00:37:42,965
You know, I remember
when y'all used to be so close.

494
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:47,194
And how hard you took it
when he left the church.

495
00:37:47,872 --> 00:37:50,864
We all love David, you know...

496
00:37:51,075 --> 00:37:54,135
...but I just wonder if his presence
is not gonna send out...

497
00:37:54,345 --> 00:37:56,540
...the wrong message
to the other members.

498
00:37:56,748 --> 00:37:58,739
- I understand.
- Yeah, now he's singing...

499
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:00,417
...with the choir on Sunday.

500
00:38:00,618 --> 00:38:03,849
Well, you know, I encouraged him
to get involved with the choir.

501
00:38:04,055 --> 00:38:08,048
Well, now, I don't know. I mean,
I'm just worried that, you know...

502
00:38:08,259 --> 00:38:10,921
...him singing with the choir will
send the wrong impression.

503
00:38:11,129 --> 00:38:15,190
He's a secular artist with a hit song
called "Let Me Undress You."

504
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:18,164
I mean, you see
what I'm getting at?

505
00:38:18,369 --> 00:38:20,837
- Doesn't look good, huh?
- No, sir.

506
00:38:21,706 --> 00:38:24,539
- No, sir.
- Well, you know, I'm of the mindset...

507
00:38:24,742 --> 00:38:27,734
...that we should spend
a little less time looking good...

508
00:38:27,945 --> 00:38:31,540
...and a little more time
actually being good.

509
00:38:32,717 --> 00:38:36,619
Now, I know David's involvement
may ruffle a few feathers.

510
00:38:36,821 --> 00:38:41,349
But I'm gonna encourage his growth
just like I did with you.

511
00:38:42,427 --> 00:38:44,361
- You remember that, don't you?
- Yeah.

512
00:38:44,562 --> 00:38:46,655
- Come on, now.
- Yes, sir.

513
00:38:46,864 --> 00:38:49,424
Now, we gotta leave those things
in God's hands.

514
00:38:49,634 --> 00:38:52,034
The God I serve got a way
of working it all out.

515
00:38:52,236 --> 00:38:54,295
And I want you
to stop worrying so much.

516
00:38:54,505 --> 00:38:55,699
- You hear me?
- Yes, sir.

517
00:38:55,907 --> 00:38:58,398
- All right, now.
- All right.

518
00:38:59,844 --> 00:39:01,179
I'm gonna sing with the choir on
Sunday. You should come through.

519
00:39:01,279 --> 00:39:03,076
I'm gonna sing with the choir on
Sunday. You should come through.

520
00:39:04,048 --> 00:39:08,007
- What's the punch line?
- Well, I figured since I'm in town...

521
00:39:08,386 --> 00:39:10,718
...I might as well help out.

522
00:39:11,722 --> 00:39:13,986
They're trying to raise money
for a new church.

523
00:39:14,192 --> 00:39:16,626
- They paying you for that?
- Come on, man.

524
00:39:16,828 --> 00:39:18,159
I'm serious, D.

525
00:39:18,362 --> 00:39:20,990
You get 40 thou a show, minimum.

526
00:39:21,199 --> 00:39:22,996
I don't get 10 percent
of these freebies.

527
00:39:23,201 --> 00:39:24,828
- It's for the church, man.
- All right.

528
00:39:25,036 --> 00:39:27,129
You sing with the choir.
They hype it up...

529
00:39:27,338 --> 00:39:29,499
...take up a little collection,
and for what?

530
00:39:29,707 --> 00:39:31,732
So Deacon So-and-So
can get a new Benz?

531
00:39:32,410 --> 00:39:34,640
Fishman has already put together
the new tour.

532
00:39:34,846 --> 00:39:36,609
We get out there or risk losing that.

533
00:39:36,814 --> 00:39:38,975
- Just work it out.
- Work out what, D?

534
00:39:39,183 --> 00:39:40,844
My father is sick.

535
00:39:41,052 --> 00:39:42,679
How can I say no?

536
00:39:42,887 --> 00:39:45,287
Want me to do the dance?
So I'm shucking and jiving.

537
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:48,118
But we gotta get back out there, man.
Time is money.

538
00:39:48,326 --> 00:39:51,420
You the "Undress Me" man, right?

539
00:39:51,629 --> 00:39:54,757
- Yeah, that's my song.
- I told y'all that was him.

540
00:39:54,966 --> 00:39:57,628
Hey, how can I get you to listen
to one of my demos?

541
00:39:58,202 --> 00:39:59,396
I got a card right here.

542
00:39:59,604 --> 00:40:01,094
- You can hit me up...
- Hold up.

543
00:40:01,305 --> 00:40:03,967
I'm singing at
New Revelations Church on Sunday.

544
00:40:05,042 --> 00:40:07,704
Find your way there,
I'll check you out.

545
00:40:07,912 --> 00:40:09,436
Church?

546
00:43:48,065 --> 00:43:50,226
This is the demo CD
I was telling you about.

547
00:43:50,434 --> 00:43:52,425
So we're bribing people
to come to church now.

548
00:43:52,636 --> 00:43:55,730
All right, man, I appreciate that.
I enjoyed the singing today.

549
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:58,636
- Thank you. Y'all take care, now.
- All right.

550
00:44:03,147 --> 00:44:06,583
- You really blew us away back there.
- Oh, well, I just do what I do...

551
00:44:06,784 --> 00:44:08,877
...when I do what I do.

552
00:44:10,087 --> 00:44:11,520
Oh, hey.

553
00:44:11,722 --> 00:44:13,383
- And who are you?
- Alexis.

554
00:44:13,591 --> 00:44:15,582
Hi, Alexis. That's a beautiful name.

555
00:44:15,793 --> 00:44:19,194
- Wow, how old are you?
- Five. How old are you?

556
00:44:20,464 --> 00:44:22,091
I'm 105.

557
00:44:22,299 --> 00:44:24,392
It's nice to meet you.

558
00:44:25,336 --> 00:44:26,997
- Wow, she's adorable.
- Thanks.

559
00:44:27,204 --> 00:44:29,968
- I see where she gets it.
- Laying it on thick, I see.

560
00:44:30,174 --> 00:44:32,642
Is there any other way to do it?

561
00:44:32,843 --> 00:44:36,301
Look, I'd rather continue
our lovely banter...

562
00:44:36,514 --> 00:44:38,345
...under different circumstances.

563
00:44:38,549 --> 00:44:42,485
Are there some digits I could use
to make that happen?

564
00:44:42,686 --> 00:44:44,449
Are you asking
for my phone number?

565
00:44:51,762 --> 00:44:54,060
Hi, I'm here for Rain.

566
00:44:54,265 --> 00:44:55,892
Sure. Come in.

567
00:45:05,843 --> 00:45:07,242
You know, he's cuter on TV.

568
00:45:07,445 --> 00:45:09,845
- Hey, Maya.
- What?

569
00:45:10,047 --> 00:45:11,605
I mean, he looks good, okay?

570
00:45:11,816 --> 00:45:13,784
I'm just saying,
keep it in perspective.

571
00:45:13,984 --> 00:45:16,043
You know how you get sometimes.

572
00:45:16,921 --> 00:45:18,479
Oscar.

573
00:45:30,067 --> 00:45:31,830
You ready?

574
00:45:32,403 --> 00:45:33,893
Sure.

575
00:45:40,711 --> 00:45:44,579
My uncle tells me you may sing again
with the choir next Sunday.

576
00:45:44,782 --> 00:45:47,080
Oh, really? Well...

577
00:45:47,818 --> 00:45:49,786
...I'm thinking about it.

578
00:45:49,987 --> 00:45:51,454
- Why?
- Why?

579
00:45:51,655 --> 00:45:53,486
Yeah. What's your motivation?

580
00:45:55,493 --> 00:45:57,222
- Do I need one?
- Yeah.

581
00:45:58,162 --> 00:46:00,255
When you sing in the choir,
it's called praise.

582
00:46:00,464 --> 00:46:03,228
Because you're praising the Lord.
That's why I do it.

583
00:46:03,434 --> 00:46:05,402
So why are you doing it?

584
00:46:05,936 --> 00:46:08,166
Does your sister give every man
the third degree?

585
00:46:08,372 --> 00:46:11,364
- Weren't we just talking about you?
- Now we're talking about you.

586
00:46:11,575 --> 00:46:12,974
Oh, goodness.

587
00:46:13,177 --> 00:46:15,805
You were about to answer
items one through 12...

588
00:46:16,013 --> 00:46:17,810
...on the first-date questionnaire.

589
00:46:18,015 --> 00:46:19,949
I have a beautiful daughter...

590
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:22,277
...and her father and I
couldn't make it work.

591
00:46:22,486 --> 00:46:25,922
- Is that why you left Chicago?
- One of the reasons.

592
00:46:26,123 --> 00:46:28,648
I also didn't wanna raise Alexis
in the city.

593
00:46:28,859 --> 00:46:30,417
Now your turn.

594
00:46:30,628 --> 00:46:32,061
Motivation.

595
00:46:32,263 --> 00:46:35,926
Motivation? Well, I could give you
about a half a dozen reasons...

596
00:46:37,635 --> 00:46:40,195
...but none beats the idea
of doing a duet with you.

597
00:46:42,239 --> 00:46:43,866
Cheers.

598
00:46:44,942 --> 00:46:46,705
Cheers.

599
00:47:01,592 --> 00:47:03,219
Charlene.

600
00:47:10,734 --> 00:47:12,167
Charlene.

601
00:47:49,807 --> 00:47:51,570
So...

602
00:47:51,775 --> 00:47:53,333
...I guess that's it.

603
00:47:53,544 --> 00:47:56,604
- I had a nice time.
- Me too. Me too. It was...

604
00:47:56,814 --> 00:47:58,748
It was great.

605
00:48:06,624 --> 00:48:09,024
- Good night.
- Yeah. Good night.

606
00:48:18,802 --> 00:48:20,429
- Good night. All right.
- Good night.

607
00:48:20,638 --> 00:48:22,333
See you later.

608
00:48:31,982 --> 00:48:35,474
What? I gotta do something
while you playing David the saint.

609
00:48:35,686 --> 00:48:37,654
- I didn't say nothing.
- I'm gonna do me, then.

610
00:48:37,855 --> 00:48:40,380
- All right. Go ahead, baby.
- No fingerprints.

611
00:50:17,287 --> 00:50:19,778
So let me get this straight.
You're dating this chick.

612
00:50:19,990 --> 00:50:22,117
- Rain.
- Oh, she's a stripper?

613
00:50:22,326 --> 00:50:25,090
- That's all you had to say.
- What? She's not a stripper.

614
00:50:25,295 --> 00:50:27,490
- Her mama gave her that name.
- Oh, okay.

615
00:50:27,698 --> 00:50:30,861
- Rain, that's French.
- It's French, huh?

616
00:50:31,535 --> 00:50:32,763
So...

617
00:50:32,970 --> 00:50:36,736
...you're not hitting it, because
she's saving it for marriage.

618
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:39,101
- Yeah.
- But she already has a kid.

619
00:50:39,309 --> 00:50:40,742
So?

620
00:50:40,944 --> 00:50:44,675
Ain't that like closing the barn door
after the horses already escaped?

621
00:50:44,882 --> 00:50:46,577
Who hurt you, man?

622
00:50:47,151 --> 00:50:49,551
I'm telling you, girl,
if you're gonna marry the man...

623
00:50:49,753 --> 00:50:51,243
...tell him you wear a weave.

624
00:50:51,455 --> 00:50:55,118
Otherwise he's gonna think his kids
are gonna be born with straight hair.

625
00:50:55,325 --> 00:50:57,088
Hold on.

626
00:50:57,294 --> 00:50:59,819
- Who is it?
- It's Oscar.

627
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:02,157
Hey. Let me call you back.

628
00:51:02,366 --> 00:51:03,663
Okay.

629
00:51:07,104 --> 00:51:09,504
- How's it going?
- What are you doing here?

630
00:51:11,708 --> 00:51:15,144
You gonna let me come in,
or do I have to stay out in the rain?

631
00:51:15,345 --> 00:51:17,472
- Daddy!
- Hey, Daddy's little princess.

632
00:51:20,217 --> 00:51:23,015
- Look at you. How you doing?
- Good.

633
00:51:23,220 --> 00:51:24,619
You have got to get over that...

634
00:51:24,822 --> 00:51:28,417
..."bad boy being saved by the love of
a good woman and Jesus" syndrome.

635
00:51:28,625 --> 00:51:32,391
It ain't healthy. Next thing you know,
you'll try to do an all-gospel album.

636
00:51:34,498 --> 00:51:36,830
Could you just take your shot?

637
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:39,159
Look what I drew, Daddy.
It's a house.

638
00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:43,169
- Wow, that's really good. Look at you.
- You couldn't call first?

639
00:51:43,373 --> 00:51:44,897
Oscar.

640
00:51:45,542 --> 00:51:47,032
I'm sorry, okay?

641
00:51:47,244 --> 00:51:50,645
I figured if I called, you wouldn't let me
come by and see Alexis.

642
00:51:50,848 --> 00:51:53,248
- I was in the neighborhood...
- In the neighborhood?

643
00:51:53,450 --> 00:51:55,042
Your sister didn't tell you?

644
00:51:55,252 --> 00:51:58,688
I got reassigned to Fort McPherson,
so I'll be in town for a while.

645
00:51:58,889 --> 00:52:00,857
I'll come by and play with you
and see you...

646
00:52:01,058 --> 00:52:03,754
...and love on you and kiss on you
whenever I get ready.

647
00:52:03,961 --> 00:52:06,156
I hate to put a dent
in your hometown fantasy...

648
00:52:06,363 --> 00:52:08,854
...but we're running out of time
in Fishman's favor bank.

649
00:52:09,066 --> 00:52:11,500
He wants us back on tour
by the end of the week.

650
00:52:11,702 --> 00:52:12,999
What?

651
00:52:13,203 --> 00:52:16,695
Look, man, I'm sorry about what
happened to your pops, really.

652
00:52:17,241 --> 00:52:18,936
We gotta get back in the saddle, D.

653
00:52:19,142 --> 00:52:21,235
Look, I don't know.

654
00:52:22,412 --> 00:52:24,209
You're a superstar.

655
00:52:24,414 --> 00:52:26,439
A long way
from where we came from.

656
00:52:26,650 --> 00:52:30,950
Struggling, working the late shift.
You know what I'm talking about?

657
00:52:31,154 --> 00:52:36,023
Now it's four-star hotels, limos,
women on standby.

658
00:52:36,593 --> 00:52:40,927
<i>That's the American Idol dream, baby.
What's to know?</i>

659
00:52:41,131 --> 00:52:42,894
What about Cathy?

660
00:52:44,067 --> 00:52:46,297
Cathy and I are no longer together.

661
00:52:46,503 --> 00:52:50,337
- Sorry to hear that.
- Oh, no, don't be sorry. She...

662
00:52:50,674 --> 00:52:53,609
Cathy wasn't my speed, you know.

663
00:52:53,810 --> 00:52:55,801
It's all about the money, right?

664
00:52:56,013 --> 00:52:58,777
I care about the money, yeah.
But I also care about you.

665
00:52:58,982 --> 00:53:01,542
When you said you wanted more,
I got you more.

666
00:53:01,752 --> 00:53:03,982
And don't tell me
you don't miss the road.

667
00:53:04,187 --> 00:53:06,212
Ate good, slept late...

668
00:53:06,423 --> 00:53:08,414
...fists full of dime brizzles.

669
00:53:08,625 --> 00:53:10,058
You know...

670
00:53:10,727 --> 00:53:14,322
...that gospel-album idea
doesn't sound bad.

671
00:53:15,499 --> 00:53:17,433
Man, I was just playing about that.

672
00:53:20,437 --> 00:53:21,961
All right. There you go.

673
00:53:22,172 --> 00:53:24,197
- Keep playing, man.
- Man, stop crying.

674
00:53:24,408 --> 00:53:26,035
Man, answer your phone.

675
00:53:27,411 --> 00:53:28,901
Hello?

676
00:53:32,215 --> 00:53:34,683
- Fred Taylor.
- 201.

677
00:54:01,378 --> 00:54:02,845
Hey.

678
00:54:06,116 --> 00:54:10,212
- I'm glad you came, son.
- Yeah, me too.

679
00:54:10,420 --> 00:54:12,752
I told them not to...

680
00:54:13,323 --> 00:54:15,689
...worry you and burden you.

681
00:54:17,194 --> 00:54:21,028
I got so much
I wanted to say to you.

682
00:54:21,231 --> 00:54:22,698
It's all right.

683
00:54:22,899 --> 00:54:27,029
Back when I was a kid...

684
00:54:28,105 --> 00:54:32,269
...my father never told me
he loved me.

685
00:54:35,045 --> 00:54:36,740
I want you to know...

686
00:54:36,947 --> 00:54:39,575
...that I never stopped
loving you, son.

687
00:54:41,018 --> 00:54:43,885
I know, Dad. I know.

688
00:54:44,187 --> 00:54:45,916
I love you too.

689
00:54:47,357 --> 00:54:50,849
When your mother died...

690
00:54:51,828 --> 00:54:55,286
...a lot of things changed
between me and you, David.

691
00:54:55,499 --> 00:54:57,490
Son, when you're young...

692
00:54:57,701 --> 00:55:01,034
...there are a lot of things
you don't understand.

693
00:55:01,905 --> 00:55:03,839
- Yeah.
- And I was being pulled...

694
00:55:04,041 --> 00:55:06,202
...in so many different directions.

695
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:08,810
Trying to build my church.

696
00:55:09,012 --> 00:55:11,981
Trying to be a good husband.

697
00:55:12,182 --> 00:55:16,050
And I tried to be a good father
to you, David.

698
00:55:21,625 --> 00:55:24,458
I'm so proud of you, David.

699
00:55:25,228 --> 00:55:28,857
I prayed and I prayed...

700
00:55:29,399 --> 00:55:31,526
...and he brought you back.

701
00:55:31,735 --> 00:55:34,135
Yeah. I'm here.

702
00:55:34,337 --> 00:55:36,134
It's okay.

703
00:55:36,339 --> 00:55:38,500
It's okay, son.

704
00:55:38,875 --> 00:55:40,934
It's okay.

705
00:58:30,580 --> 00:58:34,641
We'll make sure that the center
does a special service for him.

706
00:58:36,253 --> 00:58:38,881
And know that we'll always
be there for you, okay?

707
00:58:39,089 --> 00:58:41,956
- Thank you.
- God bless you.

708
00:59:02,445 --> 00:59:04,276
I can't buy you the things
that he can...

709
00:59:04,481 --> 00:59:06,779
...and I'm not famous
or anything like that.

710
00:59:06,983 --> 00:59:08,746
Where's all this coming from?

711
00:59:08,952 --> 00:59:11,079
I know I've made some mistakes
in the past.

712
00:59:12,722 --> 00:59:15,350
But I've always taken care
of my responsibilities.

713
00:59:16,593 --> 00:59:18,959
I've been doing
some soul-searching...

714
00:59:19,162 --> 00:59:21,426
...and I'm just trying to get it right,
you know?

715
00:59:22,299 --> 00:59:25,962
And I've been thinking that maybe
we could work on being together.

716
00:59:26,169 --> 00:59:27,830
Being a family.

717
00:59:29,139 --> 00:59:30,766
That is...

718
00:59:30,974 --> 00:59:34,375
...if things between you and
the megastar aren't too serious.

719
00:59:35,645 --> 00:59:37,408
Think about it.

720
00:59:47,624 --> 00:59:50,593
The celebration will honor
my uncle Bishop Taylor's memory...

721
00:59:50,794 --> 00:59:52,489
...and, in conclusion...

722
00:59:52,696 --> 00:59:56,530
...we will publicly recognize my
husband, Frank, as the new pastor.

723
00:59:56,733 --> 00:59:59,827
Now, there'll be a lot of important
people there to help move...

724
01:00:00,036 --> 01:00:01,697
...our ministry to the next level.

725
01:00:01,905 --> 01:00:04,840
- Really?
- Yeah, I mean, we need a victory lap...

726
01:00:05,041 --> 01:00:07,532
...to help show the congregation
and the head bishop...

727
01:00:07,744 --> 01:00:09,644
...that we in good shape.

728
01:00:09,846 --> 01:00:13,111
And, oh, I wanna take a special
offering on Sunday's service...

729
01:00:13,316 --> 01:00:15,750
...to help propel us towards that goal.
Write that down.

730
01:00:15,952 --> 01:00:18,580
I'll set it up, but I'm scheduled
to visit Divine Souls...

731
01:00:18,788 --> 01:00:21,018
...for the pastor's
anniversary service...

732
01:00:21,224 --> 01:00:23,658
...so I really won't be able
to facilitate that for you.

733
01:00:23,860 --> 01:00:26,385
- Come again?
- I won't be here.

734
01:00:26,596 --> 01:00:28,655
Oh, no, I heard that part.

735
01:00:28,865 --> 01:00:31,459
Does Divine Soul Ministries
take precedence...

736
01:00:31,668 --> 01:00:33,397
...over New Revelations business?

737
01:00:33,603 --> 01:00:36,663
Listen, Bishop Taylor would never
question my loyalty.

738
01:00:36,873 --> 01:00:38,431
I'm not Bishop Taylor.

739
01:00:38,641 --> 01:00:42,509
You don't have to remind us.
We're all quite painfully aware of that.

740
01:00:45,014 --> 01:00:46,743
Sorry I'm late.

741
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:48,281
Late for what?

742
01:00:49,185 --> 01:00:51,346
To discuss the revival plans.

743
01:00:52,622 --> 01:00:55,022
Oh, well, you know,
that's mighty noble of you...

744
01:00:55,225 --> 01:00:56,783
...young David, but...
- Reverend.

745
01:00:56,993 --> 01:01:00,190
I'm sorry, Miss Ernestine. This
meeting is for the business at hand.

746
01:01:00,397 --> 01:01:02,524
If David wants to come back,
make an appointment.

747
01:01:02,732 --> 01:01:05,098
- Thank you very much.
- Appointment?

748
01:01:05,668 --> 01:01:06,862
Does...?

749
01:01:08,905 --> 01:01:10,839
Would you like me
to send a fax or e-mail...

750
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,634
...or will a phone call suffice?
- That's not necessary.

751
01:01:13,843 --> 01:01:18,041
No, that's all right, Charlene.
We all a little emotional these days.

752
01:01:18,248 --> 01:01:21,240
Put your ego aside for one minute
so we can discuss these plans.

753
01:01:21,451 --> 01:01:23,112
You know, David...

754
01:01:23,319 --> 01:01:25,549
...this revival isn't just
about Bishop Taylor.

755
01:01:25,755 --> 01:01:27,279
The man who built this church.

756
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:29,481
We have a congregation
to think about.

757
01:01:29,692 --> 01:01:33,753
Don't pretend this event means
more to you than your own spotlight.

758
01:01:33,963 --> 01:01:35,726
Let church people handle
church business.

759
01:01:35,932 --> 01:01:39,060
This will always be my father's church.
That makes it my business.

760
01:01:39,269 --> 01:01:41,931
Don't come here talking about
"my father" and "his church."

761
01:01:42,138 --> 01:01:43,935
While you were playing
the absentee son...

762
01:01:44,140 --> 01:01:46,768
...we were here with your father
doing God's work.

763
01:01:46,976 --> 01:01:51,037
Normally, I'd be coming
at you right now, but... Hold on.

764
01:01:52,015 --> 01:01:56,076
- Out of respect for my father's church
and these people, I'll give you a pass.

765
01:01:56,286 --> 01:01:58,914
You can thank your
work with God for that.

766
01:01:59,622 --> 01:02:01,180
Amen.

767
01:02:07,197 --> 01:02:08,528
David.

768
01:02:08,731 --> 01:02:11,131
- David!
- Miss Ernestine, I love you, all right?

769
01:02:11,334 --> 01:02:13,427
But you need
to leave me alone right now.

770
01:02:13,636 --> 01:02:16,503
You're running from the church
that needs you because of adversity?

771
01:02:16,706 --> 01:02:19,140
I'm not a minister, all right?
I'm an entertainer.

772
01:02:19,342 --> 01:02:21,367
That's what I do. That's who I am.

773
01:02:21,578 --> 01:02:23,671
That's what you ran to.
That's not who you are.

774
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,178
Let them fight over it. I don't care.

775
01:02:26,382 --> 01:02:29,146
But it's your father's legacy.
Who's gonna fight if you don't?

776
01:02:29,352 --> 01:02:31,081
David!

777
01:02:48,838 --> 01:02:51,204
So, what's up?

778
01:02:52,775 --> 01:02:55,175
I just wanted to see you before I left.

779
01:02:55,912 --> 01:02:59,939
- You're leaving?
- I gotta get back on tour, you know.

780
01:03:00,149 --> 01:03:02,947
They're expecting me
in Philly tomorrow.

781
01:03:04,954 --> 01:03:06,148
My father's gone.

782
01:03:06,356 --> 01:03:08,984
Ain't no reason for me to stay.

783
01:03:10,894 --> 01:03:15,331
It was nice knowing you too,
even if it was for a little while.

784
01:03:15,532 --> 01:03:19,093
Well, I mean, we can still,
you know, stay in touch.

785
01:03:19,302 --> 01:03:22,931
Well, that's cool. You'll come back.
You'll check on us from time to time.

786
01:03:23,139 --> 01:03:27,735
- That's not what I meant.
- No, really, it's cool.

787
01:03:29,245 --> 01:03:30,507
Are you gonna get this?

788
01:03:30,713 --> 01:03:33,341
Someone must really be trying
to reach you.

789
01:03:34,117 --> 01:03:35,880
It's Oscar.

790
01:03:36,619 --> 01:03:38,587
Oh, Alexis' father.

791
01:03:38,788 --> 01:03:41,518
He just moved back here.

792
01:03:53,736 --> 01:03:55,226
What's that?

793
01:03:56,706 --> 01:03:58,230
Right.

794
01:03:59,275 --> 01:04:01,038
Oh, absolutely.

795
01:04:01,244 --> 01:04:05,510
Well, right now, Dave's just picking up
a few family mementos.

796
01:04:05,715 --> 01:04:09,378
Yes, sir. We'll hit up
a couple clubs tonight...

797
01:04:09,586 --> 01:04:12,919
...then tomorrow we're on
the first thing smoking out of here.

798
01:04:14,490 --> 01:04:17,220
Well, this is our first concert
since our little hiatus...

799
01:04:17,427 --> 01:04:20,658
...so we wanna do it big. I'm talking
about big with a capital l-G.

800
01:04:23,299 --> 01:04:25,961
A dozen dime brizzles on standby
for deviant behavior.

801
01:04:26,169 --> 01:04:27,397
Wes.

802
01:04:27,604 --> 01:04:30,198
Hold on a sec. What up, D?

803
01:04:31,841 --> 01:04:33,672
Change of plans.

804
01:04:46,222 --> 01:04:48,747
After the choir sings,
the next voice you'll hear...

805
01:04:48,958 --> 01:04:51,483
...is the Minister Terence Hunter
from New Revelations.

806
01:04:51,694 --> 01:04:54,925
Let's make sure that we give him
a Divine Souls welcome.

807
01:05:00,303 --> 01:05:01,827
Amen.

808
01:05:09,012 --> 01:05:13,506
That's some mighty powerful words
you gave us in there. I appreciate that.

809
01:05:13,716 --> 01:05:17,550
Thanks for having me. You guys are
doing some amazing things here.

810
01:05:17,754 --> 01:05:21,019
I can honestly say that the Lord is
blessing us here at Divine Souls.

811
01:05:21,224 --> 01:05:23,124
I know what's going on
with New Revelations.

812
01:05:23,326 --> 01:05:26,227
You trying to make
the deadline and all.

813
01:05:26,429 --> 01:05:27,919
So how is that coming, anyway?

814
01:05:28,131 --> 01:05:31,066
Let's just say I'm praying
about the whole situation...

815
01:05:31,267 --> 01:05:33,929
<i>... and still waiting for some direction.</i>

816
01:06:26,656 --> 01:06:28,283
Come on, now!

817
01:06:28,491 --> 01:06:29,958
Amen.

818
01:06:30,159 --> 01:06:32,059
God is good.

819
01:06:32,762 --> 01:06:34,753
We are blessed.

820
01:06:35,565 --> 01:06:37,533
- It's a new day!
- New day!

821
01:06:38,501 --> 01:06:40,230
- Amen?
- Amen.

822
01:06:40,436 --> 01:06:43,894
Amen. I want you to turn your Bibles
to the Book of Acts.

823
01:06:45,808 --> 01:06:49,005
- Thank you.
- Nice to meet you. All right.

824
01:06:52,448 --> 01:06:55,747
- I thought you went back on tour.
- I...

825
01:06:56,052 --> 01:06:58,282
I decided to stick around for a while.

826
01:06:59,288 --> 01:07:02,086
Hey, what's going on?
How are you?

827
01:07:02,291 --> 01:07:04,657
- Good.
- You sang beautifully today.

828
01:07:04,861 --> 01:07:06,624
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

829
01:07:09,198 --> 01:07:10,893
David, this is Oscar.

830
01:07:12,101 --> 01:07:14,695
- Heard a lot about you.
- Same here.

831
01:07:14,904 --> 01:07:16,633
Yeah, good to meet you.

832
01:08:13,696 --> 01:08:15,823
Nice turnout.

833
01:08:18,534 --> 01:08:19,899
See this?

834
01:08:21,971 --> 01:08:24,531
- We knew he was gonna do it.
- We knew he was gonna do it...

835
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:26,765
...but we didn't know
he'd tell the world.

836
01:08:26,976 --> 01:08:29,467
My lawyer said he'll have
the injunction squashed...

837
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:32,443
...and my residuals
back online in 30 days.

838
01:08:32,648 --> 01:08:35,515
Great. But the P.R. Is bad.

839
01:08:35,718 --> 01:08:38,744
Should've just put him on a song
and been done with it.

840
01:08:38,955 --> 01:08:42,254
Now he's making us look like fake
producers while I line up new work.

841
01:08:43,826 --> 01:08:47,592
- Did Fishman give us the extension?
- He gave it to us, yeah. But that's it.

842
01:08:47,797 --> 01:08:51,528
We gotta be back on the road
the day after the revival.

843
01:08:51,734 --> 01:08:55,192
Or your tour will be over faster
than you can say C+C Music Factory.

844
01:08:55,404 --> 01:08:58,168
- Who?
- My point exactly.

845
01:09:14,957 --> 01:09:17,050
- Minister Hunter, you got a moment?
- Sure.

846
01:09:18,194 --> 01:09:20,458
- I'll see you inside.
- All right, baby.

847
01:09:23,766 --> 01:09:25,996
How was your meeting
at Divine Souls?

848
01:09:26,202 --> 01:09:27,726
It was fine. Why?

849
01:09:27,937 --> 01:09:30,303
Well, I was just wondering
why one of my clergymen...

850
01:09:30,506 --> 01:09:34,636
...would share Revelations business
with a member of another church.

851
01:09:34,844 --> 01:09:37,176
Isaac Winston, especially.
What are you trying to do?

852
01:09:37,380 --> 01:09:38,677
Make me look bad?

853
01:09:38,881 --> 01:09:40,974
- You've got that covered by yourself.
- Right.

854
01:09:41,550 --> 01:09:44,041
Why don't we be honest
for one moment.

855
01:09:44,487 --> 01:09:46,148
You have a problem
with my appointment.

856
01:09:46,355 --> 01:09:48,915
No. I've got a problem
with your attitude and perspectives.

857
01:09:49,125 --> 01:09:52,026
And let me tell you,
the only reason I'm working with you...

858
01:09:52,228 --> 01:09:54,059
...is because Bishop Taylor
asked me to.

859
01:09:54,263 --> 01:09:57,824
In case you haven't figured it out,
as the head pastor of this church...

860
01:09:58,034 --> 01:10:00,002
...it isn't up to me
to listen to your vision.

861
01:10:00,202 --> 01:10:03,069
- It is the other way around.
- Who do you think you are?

862
01:10:03,272 --> 01:10:05,035
I'm the pastor.

863
01:10:05,241 --> 01:10:06,799
Better check yourself...

864
01:10:07,009 --> 01:10:09,807
...before you're left here
with a congregation of one.

865
01:10:23,326 --> 01:10:27,057
- You need to deal with this.
- I'll see you in a minute.

866
01:10:40,676 --> 01:10:43,645
- Minister Hunter.
- Hey, David.

867
01:10:43,846 --> 01:10:46,440
You're not staying for the service?
Is everything okay?

868
01:10:46,649 --> 01:10:48,844
Look, I'm just glad you decided
to stick around.

869
01:10:49,051 --> 01:10:51,781
This is your father's church.
He and I didn't always agree...

870
01:10:51,988 --> 01:10:54,684
...but he always had a reason
for everything that he did.

871
01:10:54,890 --> 01:10:58,155
Don't let that legacy get lost
in this new vision of Frank's ego.

872
01:11:02,898 --> 01:11:06,834
Reverend Frank, you've made
community service your mission.

873
01:11:07,036 --> 01:11:10,836
Reverend Charles Frank.
David Taylor.

874
01:11:11,040 --> 01:11:13,975
I'm so excited
that you are here today.

875
01:11:14,176 --> 01:11:17,145
This revival is gonna signify
the rebirth of evangelism...

876
01:11:17,346 --> 01:11:20,747
...and my commitment to aggressively
spreading the Gospel to people.

877
01:11:20,950 --> 01:11:23,578
You know, after this event,
people will truly understand...

878
01:11:23,786 --> 01:11:25,720
...the vision of Reverend
Charles Frank...

879
01:11:25,921 --> 01:11:28,287
...and how the Lord is using me
to bless others.

880
01:11:28,491 --> 01:11:32,086
Now, David, you went from the church
to the top of the R & B charts...

881
01:11:32,294 --> 01:11:33,659
...and back to the pulpit.

882
01:11:33,863 --> 01:11:36,730
- Help me understand how it happened.
- My dad.

883
01:11:36,932 --> 01:11:40,424
Well, my father was the bishop and
the cofounder of New Revelations.

884
01:11:40,636 --> 01:11:42,695
So that's where I have my roots.

885
01:11:42,905 --> 01:11:44,600
- I love music.
- So there's no problem...

886
01:11:44,807 --> 01:11:47,173
...with this Sandstone thing
and everything?

887
01:11:47,376 --> 01:11:49,708
- There's allegations.
- I can't talk about it.

888
01:11:49,912 --> 01:11:54,246
<i>People are talking about your
new song and the credit disputes.</i>

889
01:11:54,450 --> 01:11:58,113
It's really nothing. We had minor
creative differences. We talked it out.

890
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,982
- That happens in the industry?
- Happens all the time.

891
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:03,886
- We work it out. Everything is good?
- Everything is perfect.

892
01:12:04,093 --> 01:12:05,583
- Now the revival.
- You know...

893
01:12:05,795 --> 01:12:08,229
Reverend Frank and I are very excited
about the revival.

894
01:12:08,431 --> 01:12:10,729
We'll have tons of musical surprises
at the revival.

895
01:12:10,933 --> 01:12:13,595
We want everyone to support.
We're building a new church.

896
01:12:13,803 --> 01:12:15,031
That is a beautiful thing.

897
01:12:15,237 --> 01:12:17,603
The David Taylor gospel performance
this weekend, huh?

898
01:12:17,807 --> 01:12:20,970
Definitely. Yeah. What better way
to pay homage to my father...

899
01:12:21,177 --> 01:12:23,702
...than to salute him through song.

900
01:12:23,913 --> 01:12:25,380
And with a new building.

901
01:12:25,581 --> 01:12:29,017
Patrick. Hi, it's Charlene.

902
01:12:29,518 --> 01:12:31,543
Yeah.

903
01:12:31,921 --> 01:12:34,913
Yeah, I need you to do
a little research for me.

904
01:12:35,591 --> 01:12:38,025
Come on, make a joyful noise
in this house.

905
01:12:38,227 --> 01:12:40,559
Make a joyful noise.
Come on, make a joyful noise.

906
01:12:42,431 --> 01:12:44,922
We are here
at the Hosea Williams Center...

907
01:12:45,134 --> 01:12:47,830
...for the New Revelations
celebration.

908
01:12:48,037 --> 01:12:51,200
There are a number of celebrities
and influential people on hand...

909
01:12:51,407 --> 01:12:53,705
...including famed
Reverend Isaac Winston...

910
01:12:53,909 --> 01:12:56,571
...of the global-reaching
Divine Souls Ministry.

911
01:12:56,779 --> 01:13:00,840
I have not seen a faith-based event
of this stature in quite some time.

912
01:13:40,890 --> 01:13:43,017
I'm so glad you made it.

913
01:13:43,225 --> 01:13:46,126
I wouldn't miss this
for anything in the world.

914
01:14:11,153 --> 01:14:14,589
Hallelujah!
Come on, make it glorious!

915
01:14:15,057 --> 01:14:16,991
Make it glorious!

916
01:16:51,580 --> 01:16:55,209
<i>The event is packed.
Anticipation is high.</i>

917
01:16:55,417 --> 01:16:58,545
<i>And it all seems to center
around one man, David Taylor.</i>

918
01:18:28,544 --> 01:18:31,138
<i>And now, the next voice
that you will hear...</i>

919
01:18:31,346 --> 01:18:34,144
<i>... is that of the newly appointed
and anointed...</i>

920
01:18:34,349 --> 01:18:36,783
<i>... Reverend Charles Frank.</i>

921
01:18:49,698 --> 01:18:51,290
<i>Hallelujah!</i>

922
01:18:56,238 --> 01:18:59,207
You'd think he built this church
with his bare hands.

923
01:19:21,129 --> 01:19:24,360
Praise Jesus. Amen. Amen.
Praise the Lord.

924
01:19:24,566 --> 01:19:27,865
Praise Jesus. Amen.
God is good. Hallelujah.

925
01:19:28,604 --> 01:19:31,698
- You know, when I was...
- I just wanna share...

926
01:19:31,907 --> 01:19:37,675
...with you how I remember
when my father, Bishop Taylor...

927
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:40,144
...founded New Revelations.
Remember that, Frank?

928
01:19:40,349 --> 01:19:42,977
Of course. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

929
01:19:43,185 --> 01:19:47,121
As a little boy,
he instilled in me the need...

930
01:19:47,322 --> 01:19:49,984
...to preach the word of God...

931
01:19:50,192 --> 01:19:53,457
...in a way that made
everyone open...

932
01:19:54,229 --> 01:19:55,594
...to receive it.

933
01:19:58,033 --> 01:20:01,366
Not just the rich and educated,
but everyone.

934
01:20:01,570 --> 01:20:03,231
- He taught us...
- You know, we thank...

935
01:20:03,438 --> 01:20:08,398
...brother Taylor here for his rendition
in our memorial. Don't we, saints?

936
01:20:09,978 --> 01:20:11,275
Amen.

937
01:20:11,847 --> 01:20:15,339
But, you know, when Moses
led the slaves away from Pharaoh...

938
01:20:15,551 --> 01:20:18,349
...he had a vision. When he
received the Commandments...

939
01:20:18,554 --> 01:20:20,784
...from the mountaintop,
he had a vision. Amen?

940
01:20:21,123 --> 01:20:24,286
And when the naysayers
wanted to return...

941
01:20:24,493 --> 01:20:27,724
...to the bondage of slavery
rather than see that vision...

942
01:20:27,930 --> 01:20:31,764
...Moses parted the Red Sea. Amen.

943
01:20:31,967 --> 01:20:36,461
Oh, I'll tell you. He did not need
the approval of his comrades.

944
01:20:36,672 --> 01:20:41,439
No, he needed a vision from God,
and let no man...

945
01:20:41,643 --> 01:20:45,943
...no man challenge his destiny.
Hallelujah. Praise the Lord.

946
01:20:52,387 --> 01:20:55,117
We can definitely afford
the down payment now.

947
01:20:55,324 --> 01:20:58,122
Just when I was looking
at giving you guys a check.

948
01:20:58,327 --> 01:21:00,887
Well, the Lord helps those
who help themselves.

949
01:21:01,096 --> 01:21:04,827
Yes, and you guys have certainly
worked hard at the church.

950
01:21:05,033 --> 01:21:07,729
That had to do with David
and the people he got to perform.

951
01:21:07,936 --> 01:21:12,134
And let's not forget the excellent
sermon by Reverend Frank.

952
01:21:12,341 --> 01:21:15,538
No, not at all. It was fascinating
as well as effective.

953
01:21:15,744 --> 01:21:19,077
And, Miss Adams,
you were simply spectacular.

954
01:21:19,281 --> 01:21:22,580
With all that Bishop Taylor did
for this city, it was the least I could do.

955
01:21:22,784 --> 01:21:26,845
Bishop had a profound effect on us all.
We loved it when he came to Detroit.

956
01:21:27,055 --> 01:21:29,956
Well, I'm especially proud
and appreciative...

957
01:21:30,158 --> 01:21:32,251
...because he was a huge fan
of the both of you.

958
01:21:32,461 --> 01:21:35,191
Now, he left some big shoes to fill.
Make us proud.

959
01:21:35,397 --> 01:21:38,264
He's gonna be all right.
He's got some good stock.

960
01:21:41,169 --> 01:21:43,160
I cannot believe you, David.

961
01:21:43,372 --> 01:21:45,135
How can you
embarrass this church?

962
01:21:45,340 --> 01:21:49,242
Hold on. The people that performed
came because I asked them.

963
01:21:49,444 --> 01:21:51,412
Let's not forget the tickets
my name sold.

964
01:21:51,613 --> 01:21:55,049
Despite your husband's
pathetic personal infomercial.

965
01:21:55,250 --> 01:21:57,718
I wanna say something, I'll say it.
I earned that much.

966
01:21:57,919 --> 01:22:01,514
You earned that much? You don't
even know what that word means.

967
01:22:02,991 --> 01:22:06,791
My cousin, the two-bit thief,
who goes from minor performer...

968
01:22:06,995 --> 01:22:10,988
...to chart-topper by forcing
Sandstone into signing a bogus deal?

969
01:22:11,199 --> 01:22:13,759
No, no, no. Did you even imagine
what kind of dark cloud...

970
01:22:13,969 --> 01:22:16,460
...you could've put over
what Frank has worked hard for?

971
01:22:16,672 --> 01:22:18,936
And I stuck up for you.

972
01:22:19,141 --> 01:22:21,371
I have better things
to do with my imagination...

973
01:22:21,576 --> 01:22:24,204
...than to worry about Frank's
delusions of grandeur.

974
01:22:24,413 --> 01:22:26,540
All right? I'll leave that to you.

975
01:22:28,350 --> 01:22:31,808
Yeah, go ahead and run, David.
You've always been good at that.

976
01:22:50,472 --> 01:22:53,441
So don't keep me in suspense.
Who are they from?

977
01:22:53,642 --> 01:22:58,306
"Looking forward to a new start.
David."

978
01:23:02,617 --> 01:23:04,278
So all this is yours.

979
01:23:04,486 --> 01:23:06,784
I underestimated you, Frank.

980
01:23:06,988 --> 01:23:10,515
I gotta tell you, man,
I am very impressed.

981
01:23:10,726 --> 01:23:15,629
That means a lot coming from you.
I mean, with your pull on the north...

982
01:23:15,831 --> 01:23:18,561
...and my developments here,
we can do things in this world...

983
01:23:18,767 --> 01:23:20,530
...that few men have ever thought of.

984
01:23:20,736 --> 01:23:23,500
First New Revelations
and next the world, huh?

985
01:23:23,705 --> 01:23:26,469
- Amen.
- Brother, you are ambitious.

986
01:23:33,982 --> 01:23:36,416
- Miss Ernestine.
- Never thought Eden...

987
01:23:36,618 --> 01:23:40,452
...would be littered
with so many emotional demons.

988
01:23:42,057 --> 01:23:44,457
I'll give you two a moment to talk.

989
01:23:47,129 --> 01:23:50,496
You know, Miss Ernestine, I ain't
no different from Martin Luther King...

990
01:23:50,699 --> 01:23:52,564
...or any other great man
with a vision.

991
01:23:52,768 --> 01:23:57,068
Don't sell yourself short, son.
Tell me what you really think.

992
01:23:57,272 --> 01:24:00,036
Oh, when I'm done, I'm gonna
have me a retirement village...

993
01:24:00,242 --> 01:24:02,107
...and a grade school out here.

994
01:24:02,310 --> 01:24:04,505
I always figured your passion
to do God's work...

995
01:24:04,713 --> 01:24:06,908
...would do wonders for his ministry.

996
01:24:07,115 --> 01:24:10,016
Now it seems to have become
a drug for the spotlight.

997
01:24:10,218 --> 01:24:12,516
- What's wrong with progression?
- Nothing.

998
01:24:12,721 --> 01:24:15,281
As long as the priorities line up.

999
01:24:15,490 --> 01:24:19,517
Some might get lost in the hype
and see it as playing with God.

1000
01:24:20,128 --> 01:24:23,359
Kind of makes you question
Bishop Taylor's selection of you.

1001
01:24:24,666 --> 01:24:26,657
Funny...

1002
01:24:26,868 --> 01:24:29,928
...I never questioned
his judgment before.

1003
01:24:30,138 --> 01:24:32,504
So, what are you saying?

1004
01:24:35,811 --> 01:24:40,441
With all the bickering, dissension
and the wives, I...

1005
01:24:40,816 --> 01:24:44,479
I don't think I have the stomach
for this anymore.

1006
01:24:55,330 --> 01:24:58,857
D. All right, I trust you
and I believe in you...

1007
01:24:59,067 --> 01:25:01,058
...but you need to let me
send a car for you.

1008
01:25:01,269 --> 01:25:03,499
You don't need to send a car.
I got the rental.

1009
01:25:03,705 --> 01:25:07,163
I hear you talking. Now, be for real,
will you be at the airport or what?

1010
01:25:07,375 --> 01:25:10,367
- I'll be there.
- I said, you... Hello?

1011
01:25:18,620 --> 01:25:20,986
Hey. Look, I'm sorry for just...

1012
01:25:23,258 --> 01:25:26,989
You got company, huh? That's...

1013
01:25:28,430 --> 01:25:30,523
My bad.

1014
01:25:30,732 --> 01:25:33,257
David, wait. Wait.

1015
01:25:33,468 --> 01:25:36,494
Look, I like you. I do.

1016
01:25:36,705 --> 01:25:39,196
And I want nothing more
than for you to be happy.

1017
01:25:39,407 --> 01:25:42,604
It's just that right now, I think I'm more
of a convenient distraction.

1018
01:25:43,845 --> 01:25:46,245
A convenient distraction.

1019
01:25:46,448 --> 01:25:50,384
I'll remember to program that into my
phone, all right, next to your number.

1020
01:25:50,585 --> 01:25:53,520
I'm not saying
you're not being sincere.

1021
01:25:53,722 --> 01:25:55,952
It's just that
you're all over the place.

1022
01:25:56,157 --> 01:25:59,388
- And I want you to have time...
- Look, listen to me.

1023
01:25:59,594 --> 01:26:03,360
You have a shot at making things
work with the father of your child.

1024
01:26:08,336 --> 01:26:09,997
Who could be mad at that?

1025
01:26:11,106 --> 01:26:12,471
All right?

1026
01:26:30,926 --> 01:26:33,087
Why are you sitting in the dark?

1027
01:26:34,896 --> 01:26:38,423
I may have been in the dark
all this time and I just didn't know it.

1028
01:26:38,633 --> 01:26:40,260
About what?

1029
01:26:41,069 --> 01:26:43,503
About the church.

1030
01:26:43,705 --> 01:26:46,139
About David, about everything.

1031
01:26:47,175 --> 01:26:49,473
You don't have to worry
about David.

1032
01:26:50,245 --> 01:26:55,444
After what I found out, he's not gonna
be a thorn in your side anymore.

1033
01:26:57,052 --> 01:26:59,748
You're responsible
for people seeing that?

1034
01:27:00,822 --> 01:27:03,655
I have to protect the church, Frank.

1035
01:27:03,858 --> 01:27:05,485
In the process,
what have we become?

1036
01:27:05,694 --> 01:27:07,218
What?

1037
01:27:07,529 --> 01:27:10,828
Are you...?
Are you putting this all on me?

1038
01:27:11,032 --> 01:27:14,627
You're my wife, church's legal
counsel and David's cousin.

1039
01:27:14,836 --> 01:27:16,463
Who else am I supposed
to put this on?

1040
01:27:17,005 --> 01:27:20,702
Don't you get
self-righteous with me, Frank.

1041
01:27:21,576 --> 01:27:24,238
I'm serious. You know,
I can deal with the arrogance.

1042
01:27:24,446 --> 01:27:27,540
I can deal with the ego,
I can deal with the insensitivity...

1043
01:27:27,749 --> 01:27:31,344
...but I won't stomach hypocrisy.
- Now, hold on, Charlene!

1044
01:27:31,553 --> 01:27:34,317
No, you let me talk!
You can talk when I'm finished.

1045
01:27:34,522 --> 01:27:38,356
This thing between us doesn't have
anything to do with David or church.

1046
01:27:38,560 --> 01:27:40,824
It has everything to do
with you wanting a family...

1047
01:27:41,029 --> 01:27:42,997
...and me not being able
to give you one.

1048
01:27:43,198 --> 01:27:45,598
- I didn't say any of that.
- You say it all the time!

1049
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:49,236
Every day you say it! The way you
look at me, the way you touch me.

1050
01:27:49,437 --> 01:27:51,837
I'm tired of being made to feel like
half a woman...

1051
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:54,838
...because I can't give you a child.
- Well, you know what?

1052
01:27:55,043 --> 01:27:58,740
You might not feel that way if you gave
your man something to look forward to!

1053
01:28:05,286 --> 01:28:07,049
I didn't mean that.

1054
01:28:08,089 --> 01:28:10,250
I didn't mean it.

1055
01:28:10,825 --> 01:28:13,020
You're amazing.

1056
01:28:13,395 --> 01:28:17,092
You quote Scripture
like nobody I know.

1057
01:28:18,933 --> 01:28:22,892
You know the Bible
backward and forward.

1058
01:28:23,671 --> 01:28:25,901
And you still...

1059
01:28:27,308 --> 01:28:29,469
You have no clue.

1060
01:28:33,681 --> 01:28:35,444
No clue.

1061
01:28:39,220 --> 01:28:41,552
You need Jesus, Frank.

1062
01:28:44,192 --> 01:28:47,389
- Charlene.
- You need Jesus.

1063
01:28:53,668 --> 01:28:55,465
Charlene.

1064
01:29:19,928 --> 01:29:23,728
<i>Attention, passengers, this will be
the final call for flight 201...</i>

1065
01:29:23,932 --> 01:29:26,628
<i>... now boarding at gate 56B.</i>

1066
01:30:00,268 --> 01:30:03,704
Excuse me, pastor. It's almost time.

1067
01:30:06,074 --> 01:30:07,769
All right.

1068
01:30:11,646 --> 01:30:13,511
All right.

1069
01:30:36,538 --> 01:30:39,063
I don't really know what to say.

1070
01:30:41,609 --> 01:30:43,577
Wish you were here.

1071
01:30:53,555 --> 01:30:56,319
You were never there.

1072
01:30:56,524 --> 01:30:59,687
All right? I needed you.

1073
01:31:02,430 --> 01:31:04,421
I need you now.

1074
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:12,035
- As I take this to a close
and reflect on the message.

1075
01:31:13,508 --> 01:31:16,170
Living through the eye of the storm.

1076
01:31:19,447 --> 01:31:22,007
This particular message
is one that's close to my heart...

1077
01:31:22,217 --> 01:31:24,412
...if I can be transparent
for a moment.

1078
01:31:26,321 --> 01:31:28,516
Okay, God.

1079
01:31:29,724 --> 01:31:31,589
What do you want from me?

1080
01:31:33,528 --> 01:31:35,462
I don't understand.

1081
01:31:36,831 --> 01:31:38,958
Why are you doing this again?

1082
01:31:39,167 --> 01:31:43,103
Now, I've been living in the
eye of the storm for some time now.

1083
01:31:43,304 --> 01:31:45,238
Can we talk about it?

1084
01:31:49,410 --> 01:31:51,105
Can we talk about it?

1085
01:31:53,815 --> 01:31:57,251
Like many of y'all,
mine was self-imposed.

1086
01:31:58,519 --> 01:32:01,420
Now, I could flee or fight.
There ain't no change.

1087
01:32:01,623 --> 01:32:04,319
Or I can call on my friends.
They ain't around.

1088
01:32:04,525 --> 01:32:07,085
And it's at that moment...

1089
01:32:07,295 --> 01:32:11,664
...that God has you exactly
where he wants you to be.

1090
01:32:15,036 --> 01:32:18,335
Dependent on him.

1091
01:32:18,906 --> 01:32:20,134
That's right.

1092
01:32:21,075 --> 01:32:23,839
Am I supposed to learn something
from this?

1093
01:32:25,647 --> 01:32:28,138
Are you listening to me?

1094
01:32:28,349 --> 01:32:31,182
Do you hear me?

1095
01:32:31,786 --> 01:32:35,085
Do you hear me?

1096
01:32:35,290 --> 01:32:39,192
You know, I can think about
how difficult it was for me to let go...

1097
01:32:39,394 --> 01:32:44,354
...of my will, you know, my ego,
and allow God to run things.

1098
01:32:49,003 --> 01:32:50,436
Your pastor's not perfect.

1099
01:32:52,573 --> 01:32:54,336
I'm flawed.

1100
01:32:54,542 --> 01:32:56,169
I'm flawed.

1101
01:32:56,377 --> 01:32:59,210
But with God's blessing and direction,
you know...

1102
01:32:59,414 --> 01:33:02,406
...I will see my way
through the storm...

1103
01:33:04,352 --> 01:33:08,880
...and have clear skies
on the other side! Amen?

1104
01:33:09,757 --> 01:33:12,590
<i>That's when I can look back
and let my testimony...</i>

1105
01:33:12,794 --> 01:33:18,426
<i>... be a beacon to help someone else
out of the storm too.</i>

1106
01:33:19,434 --> 01:33:21,629
<i>- You know?
- Amen.</i>

1107
01:33:21,836 --> 01:33:23,599
<i>Yeah.</i>

1108
01:33:25,073 --> 01:33:27,837
Okay, I won't run anymore...

1109
01:33:28,376 --> 01:33:30,003
...Lord.

1110
01:33:43,591 --> 01:33:45,081
Amen.

1111
01:33:47,228 --> 01:33:49,093
Amen.

1112
01:33:53,167 --> 01:33:57,604
As the choir begins to sing,
there are some of you...

1113
01:33:57,805 --> 01:34:00,797
...who are going through
your own storms.

1114
01:34:01,008 --> 01:34:03,169
Can we talk about it?

1115
01:34:03,378 --> 01:34:06,575
Won't you come on down?
Won't you come?

1116
01:34:16,290 --> 01:34:17,689
Amen.

1117
01:34:21,062 --> 01:34:23,394
Don't allow those situations
in your life...

1118
01:34:23,598 --> 01:34:26,590
...to keep you from having
a relationship with God.

1119
01:34:26,801 --> 01:34:29,326
No, you need to know him.

1120
01:34:31,038 --> 01:34:35,372
You know, many of us talk about,
"Oh, I'll get to know God tomorrow."

1121
01:34:35,576 --> 01:34:39,410
Tomorrow is a promise
that you can have salvation today.

1122
01:34:39,614 --> 01:34:41,411
Now, won't you come?

1123
01:34:45,420 --> 01:34:48,617
Won't you come on down, brother?
Come on down.

1124
01:35:00,735 --> 01:35:01,997
Won't you come?

1125
01:35:05,773 --> 01:35:08,742
Won't you come, sister?
Come on down, sister.

1126
01:35:08,943 --> 01:35:11,912
God loves you. God be praised.
God be praised!

1127
01:35:17,718 --> 01:35:19,686
Won't you come?

1128
01:35:19,887 --> 01:35:21,252
Come.

1129
01:35:42,076 --> 01:35:45,807
There is no perfect church.

1130
01:35:46,013 --> 01:35:50,507
If there's a perfect church, it stopped
being perfect when we walked in.

1131
01:35:50,718 --> 01:35:53,482
But there is a perfect God.

1132
01:35:53,688 --> 01:35:55,212
Won't you come, brother?

1133
01:36:06,934 --> 01:36:08,561
Amen.

1134
01:36:13,074 --> 01:36:18,011
<i>When I was little, my father read me
the story of a young man...</i>

1135
01:36:18,212 --> 01:36:22,239
<i>... who decided to leave home
and strike out on his own.</i>

1136
01:36:22,450 --> 01:36:26,409
<i>He was determined to live life
on his own terms.</i>

1137
01:36:26,621 --> 01:36:28,555
<i>And although he knew
right from wrong...</i>

1138
01:36:28,756 --> 01:36:33,352
<i>... it seemed so much better
to do things his own way.</i>

1139
01:36:56,150 --> 01:36:59,347
<i>Soon, that road got rough.</i>

1140
01:36:59,554 --> 01:37:01,715
<i>He spent all his money...</i>

1141
01:37:03,324 --> 01:37:05,758
<i>... and was doing all sorts of things
to survive.</i>

1142
01:37:14,135 --> 01:37:15,898
<i>Eventually, he hit rock bottom.</i>

1143
01:37:19,240 --> 01:37:20,434
<i>At that point...</i>

1144
01:37:22,276 --> 01:37:25,404
<i>... he realizes that he had
placed himself in that situation.</i>

1145
01:37:40,628 --> 01:37:45,065
<i>And he prayed about it
and returned home.</i>

1146
01:38:03,184 --> 01:38:08,679
<i>Now, upon his arrival, his father
prepared a huge feast in celebration.</i>

1147
01:38:08,889 --> 01:38:12,552
<i>When his other son inquired
about this, the father told him:</i>

1148
01:38:12,760 --> 01:38:18,460
<i>"My son has learned the error
of his ways and he's returned. "</i>

1149
01:38:19,667 --> 01:38:24,195
<i>It is my belief that upon that day
of returning to that spiritual place...</i>

1150
01:38:24,405 --> 01:38:28,000
<i>... I will be greeted
by the Almighty Father...</i>

1151
01:38:28,209 --> 01:38:32,043
<i>... and he too will smile upon me
and say:</i>

1152
01:38:32,246 --> 01:38:34,908
<i>"Welcome home.</i>

1153
01:38:35,116 --> 01:38:37,482
<i>Welcome home. "</i>
