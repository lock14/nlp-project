1
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,228
Let us finish it.

2
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:45,081
- Perhaps it is a trap.
- It is.

3
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:47,416
Then what do we do?

4
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,503
We break through.

5
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:49,145
There!

6
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,397
I see him.

7
00:04:06,538 --> 00:04:08,414
Pagans!

8
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,427
- Forward still.
- Retreat!

9
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:24,347
No! Do not stop.

10
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:49,538
We are her salvation, and through
her command we shall live forever.

11
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:52,500
I will not die.
Not here, not now!

12
00:04:52,542 --> 00:04:55,211
Never!

13
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,191
No!

14
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,039
We're almost there.

15
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:22,751
You'll make it.
I won't let you die.

16
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,906
You're strong enough.

17
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:54,909
Finish it.

18
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:12,134
Don't worry.
We'll be all right.

19
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:15,262
I just need to take a little.

20
00:09:59,474 --> 00:10:01,725
Finish it.

21
00:10:11,778 --> 00:10:15,197
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Take a walk with me.

22
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,283
- I have to work.
- It's the first snow...

23
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:20,577
Yeah, I know, but they're waiting on me.

24
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,539
- Come on, Tommy.
- Please, Izzi.

25
00:10:27,252 --> 00:10:29,169
I'm sorry.

26
00:10:29,212 --> 00:10:31,213
I am.

27
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:37,219
I'll see you tonight.

28
00:13:14,669 --> 00:13:16,920
Finish it.

29
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:21,633
Please, leave me alone.

30
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:25,721
I don't know how it ends.

31
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:58,795
All right.

32
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,465
I trust you.

33
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:03,592
Take me.

34
00:14:06,262 --> 00:14:08,263
Show me.

35
00:14:15,772 --> 00:14:18,106
- What are you doing here?
- Take a walk with me.

36
00:14:18,149 --> 00:14:20,150
- I have to work.
- It's the first snow...

37
00:14:20,235 --> 00:14:23,070
Yeah, I know, but they're waiting on me.

38
00:14:23,112 --> 00:14:26,281
- Come on, Tommy.
- Please, Izzi.

39
00:14:27,784 --> 00:14:29,284
I'm sorry.

40
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,662
I am.

41
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:35,123
I'll see you tonight, OK?

42
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,255
Izzi.

43
00:14:41,589 --> 00:14:45,050
Hey! Dr Creo.
Antonio's on his way back.

44
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:49,137
Donovan's open and ready.
His vitals are steady.

45
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:52,975
Dammit.

46
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:55,811
Come on.

47
00:14:55,853 --> 00:15:01,775
- Did he say if it was working?
- Just said to grab you and meet in Surgery.

48
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:07,573
- Where is he?
- I'm not sure.

49
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,783
- Call him.
- OK.

50
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:15,330
Antonio sent me ahead with the scans.
He's still busy in Chem Lab.

51
00:15:15,373 --> 00:15:18,875
Breeny, it's Manny.
Where's Antonio?

52
00:15:19,002 --> 00:15:22,754
- It's still growing aggressively.
- That much in two days!

53
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:25,882
What do you mean, you don't know?
Go get him. Find him.

54
00:15:28,845 --> 00:15:31,722
He's been lying open 50 minutes now.

55
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:36,602
- He's crossing the street.
- The results?

56
00:15:36,686 --> 00:15:40,606
- I didn't ask.
- Meet him at the elevator. Get his ass in here.

57
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:46,653
Micromanipulators at 42 degrees,
mediolateral, 72.

58
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,530
Yup.

59
00:15:48,573 --> 00:15:51,742
How we doing, Donovan?
You hanging in?

60
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:59,875
No good.
Great specificity, but no suppression.

61
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,383
- Shall we close?
- No, euthanise.

62
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:13,680
- Why?
- If we don't treat now, the growth gets him.

63
00:16:13,723 --> 00:16:15,682
Dammit!

64
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:03,772
- I'll prepare the pentabarbital.
- No, wait.

65
00:17:08,736 --> 00:17:12,781
- What is it?
- That compound we played with last year.

66
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:17,577
- Which one?
- From that tree from Central America.

67
00:17:20,123 --> 00:17:24,334
- That one.
- "Natul tortuosa. 82-A46."

68
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:27,045
- From Guatemala.
- The old-growth tree.

69
00:17:27,130 --> 00:17:32,634
We had two samples, but it was sterile.
The graftings and clippings didn't take either.

70
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,137
- That's it.
- What's happening?

71
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:38,557
Mix it with your compound.
They've got a similar structure.

72
00:17:38,641 --> 00:17:42,644
- Manny, find those samples.
- I don't see it.

73
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:46,940
Picture them side by side.
Fold them into each other like two lovers,

74
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:49,443
woman on top.

75
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,820
They have complementary domains.

76
00:17:51,863 --> 00:17:54,406
- If we can get them to stick...
- Is this it?

77
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,660
- Go!
- We have no toxicity reports, not a single...

78
00:17:58,703 --> 00:18:02,998
It doesn't matter. Donovan's on the table.
If we do nothing, he dies.

79
00:18:03,082 --> 00:18:05,292
- Antonio, how long?
- Two hours.

80
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:07,586
Keep him under.

81
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:18,096
- I've never seen that adhesion pattern.
- What's it binding to it?

82
00:18:18,181 --> 00:18:23,935
I don't know. But it's definitely
attaching to the high-growth regions.

83
00:18:24,020 --> 00:18:26,021
Let's do it.

84
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:28,356
.751, 1.25.

85
00:18:28,441 --> 00:18:31,943
- Syringe is loaded.
- Give it.

86
00:18:33,905 --> 00:18:36,031
Manny, give me light.

87
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,830
Lowering.

88
00:18:44,999 --> 00:18:47,793
- Injecting.
- Injection at 23:57.

89
00:18:47,877 --> 00:18:52,005
- 23:57.
- Good boy, Donovan. Good boy.

90
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,440
- What's up?
- My ring.

91
00:19:10,525 --> 00:19:12,025
- What ring?
- My wedding ring.

92
00:19:12,068 --> 00:19:16,071
- Where'd you leave it?
- Right there, where I always put it.

93
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:20,283
- Someone must've knocked it on the ground.
- Tommy, may I have a word with you?

94
00:19:20,368 --> 00:19:22,786
- One second.
- What are you doing?

95
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:26,540
- It's my ring. I put it there.
- It's gotta be here.

96
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:31,086
- I need to talk to you.
- Don't worry about it. We'll find it.

97
00:19:34,715 --> 00:19:35,715
Tommy...

98
00:19:38,094 --> 00:19:41,221
- I'm concerned.
- What?

99
00:19:41,264 --> 00:19:46,434
I saw Betty in the hall. She was hysterical.
You've been running sloppy surgeries.

100
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,146
- Nonsense!
- You injected an untested compound.

101
00:19:50,231 --> 00:19:52,691
He was open.
We were about to put him down.

102
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:56,403
NIH could shut us down.
I should shut you down for it.

103
00:19:56,445 --> 00:20:00,282
You're reckless
and you're losing perspective.

104
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:08,665
Look, why don't you just
take a few days at home.

105
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:13,628
Spend a little time with Izzi.

106
00:20:13,671 --> 00:20:17,048
I'm here for her.

107
00:20:38,279 --> 00:20:40,280
Izzi.

108
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,162
Izzi?

109
00:20:48,164 --> 00:20:50,040
Iz?

110
00:20:54,337 --> 00:20:56,212
Izzi?

111
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:01,259
Izzi.

112
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:11,603
Izzi!

113
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,605
- Tommy?
- Isabel!

114
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:22,405
That's funny.
Very funny.

115
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,367
What are you doing?

116
00:21:25,409 --> 00:21:29,371
I'm... I'm stargazing.
I found it in the attic.

117
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:34,042
- Come on in. It's freezing.
- I want you to see something. Come on.

118
00:21:34,085 --> 00:21:36,836
You're an old fart.

119
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:45,553
OK.

120
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:51,017
Go on. Look.

121
00:21:55,898 --> 00:21:57,649
- You see it?
- The gold star?

122
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:03,363
It's actually a nebula wrapped around
a dying star. That's what makes it look gold.

123
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:06,491
What?

124
00:22:06,575 --> 00:22:08,868
- I took science.
- When?

125
00:22:10,413 --> 00:22:12,831
Junior high.

126
00:22:17,044 --> 00:22:20,588
- The Mayans called it Xibalba.
- Xibalba?

127
00:22:22,425 --> 00:22:27,303
It was their underworld.
The place the dead souls go to be reborn.

128
00:22:27,888 --> 00:22:29,931
What? What are you talking about?

129
00:22:29,974 --> 00:22:32,100
My book.

130
00:22:32,143 --> 00:22:35,270
- I'm writing about it.
- I thought it took place in Spain.

131
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,439
It begins there.

132
00:22:37,523 --> 00:22:39,774
Ends there.

133
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,027
Are you done?

134
00:22:42,111 --> 00:22:44,487
- Almost.
- Good. When do I read it?

135
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:57,792
Someday soon it will explode, die,
and give birth to new stars.

136
00:22:57,877 --> 00:23:03,214
How amazing that the Mayans chose
a dying star to represent their underworld.

137
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:06,468
Of all the healthy points of light in the sky,

138
00:23:07,845 --> 00:23:10,138
how did they find one that was dying?

139
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:15,060
Where are your shoes?

140
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,984
Izzi! Come on, come on.
Let's warm you up.

141
00:23:25,571 --> 00:23:27,864
Whoa, whoa. Careful.

142
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,949
OK. I'll get it.

143
00:23:31,327 --> 00:23:33,369
Careful. Iz?

144
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,291
Stop. No!

145
00:23:38,334 --> 00:23:40,210
Get inside.

146
00:23:40,336 --> 00:23:42,337
Serves you right.

147
00:24:36,851 --> 00:24:39,310
Is she a redhead?

148
00:24:40,396 --> 00:24:42,355
What?

149
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:48,153
I left it in Surgery.

150
00:24:48,237 --> 00:24:51,239
If you can't wait, you can't wait.

151
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:56,661
I'm joking.

152
00:24:56,745 --> 00:25:00,540
- I'll make some coffee.
- Wait. The sponge.

153
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:07,005
I want you to heat it.

154
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:40,496
Outside, before,
you couldn't feel the cold.

155
00:25:40,581 --> 00:25:42,290
Tommy.

156
00:25:43,584 --> 00:25:47,170
- I'm calling Dr Lipper.
- No! I'm afraid.

157
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:50,965
Jesus, I'm sorry.

158
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,472
- It's been happening for a while.
- What?

159
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:00,850
- I'm losing sensitivity to hot and cold.
- Why didn't you tell me?

160
00:26:00,935 --> 00:26:04,062
Because I feel different inside.

161
00:26:04,146 --> 00:26:06,689
I feel different.

162
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:09,067
Every moment.

163
00:26:09,151 --> 00:26:11,319
Each one.

164
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:15,990
Tommy?

165
00:26:27,419 --> 00:26:28,670
Oh, Jesus.

166
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:32,340
Look, don't worry.
Don't worry. All right? I'm here.

167
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,509
I will always be here.

168
00:26:38,973 --> 00:26:41,140
I know. Yes, I know, Iz.

169
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,495
Got you.

170
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:03,097
- Hello?
- Alan? Tommy.

171
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,100
- Tommy.
- What's the earliest you can make tomorrow?

172
00:28:06,143 --> 00:28:10,855
- Let me check my schedule.
- It's time for you to read it.

173
00:28:10,939 --> 00:28:17,487
- Three? I'm in Surgery till then. Is it urgent?
- No, no. That's fine. Thanks, Alan. Bye.

174
00:28:17,571 --> 00:28:21,074
- We're going to see him tomorrow.
- Start it. Tell me what you think.

175
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:23,951
- But it's not done.
- Not quite.

176
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:31,292
Don't answer it.

177
00:28:31,335 --> 00:28:34,712
- Hello? Antonio, what's wrong?
- Can you get down here?

178
00:28:34,797 --> 00:28:37,465
- What is it?
- Donovan.

179
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,550
- Is he OK?
- He's perfectly fine.

180
00:28:39,635 --> 00:28:41,803
- What's happening?
- You won't believe me.

181
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:44,472
You've got to see for yourself.
Come right away.

182
00:28:46,433 --> 00:28:48,559
No, I can't now. I can't.

183
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:01,322
- To Donovan!
- What's going on?

184
00:29:01,407 --> 00:29:04,075
- Show him.
- I came to check up on Donovan.

185
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:07,412
- Where is Donovan?
- That's him.

186
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:11,416
What? It can't be.

187
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:19,340
He's almost healed.
There's hair growth.

188
00:29:19,383 --> 00:29:23,177
- I didn't believe it either.
- Antonio had me run some tests.

189
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:26,347
Donovan responded well.
Really well.

190
00:29:27,307 --> 00:29:30,518
I pulled up videos of him pre-op.
He's testing twice as well.

191
00:29:30,561 --> 00:29:37,150
We're seeing an increase in neural activity
in all areas usually stunted by ageing.

192
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:44,157
- And the tumour?
- No change.

193
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:50,705
The growth patterns are normal.
There's no positive or negative effect.

194
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:54,834
- We should tell Dr Guzetti right away.
- No! No.

195
00:30:02,885 --> 00:30:04,802
Antonio,

196
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:08,556
prep a new cocktail.
Stick with the same substance.

197
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:10,725
What?

198
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,019
- We're moving forward.
- Wait.

199
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:15,229
But this could be a medical first.

200
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:18,733
A revelation! We've gotta pursue it
and duplicate the findings.

201
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:22,570
We can monitor synaptic growth,
but our focus is tumours, not ageing.

202
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:27,783
- I know, but...
- I want the next subject ready for surgery.

203
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,763
- Is everything all right?
- Yes.

204
00:31:30,806 --> 00:31:33,266
Everything's all right.

205
00:33:29,758 --> 00:33:31,050
Inquisitor?

206
00:33:34,763 --> 00:33:37,098
Enter.

207
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:42,895
The heretics.

208
00:33:42,938 --> 00:33:47,274
They have confessed
and ceded their lands to your holy office.

209
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:49,819
They await your judgment.

210
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:54,240
Yet another slice of her nation is mine.

211
00:33:57,244 --> 00:34:01,163
Soon she will be powerless against me.

212
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:06,001
Queen of nothing but her sins.

213
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,130
What will you do with her?

214
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:12,717
She too will confess,
and then

215
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,886
she too will die.

216
00:34:52,674 --> 00:34:55,676
Captain. 'Tis the queen.

217
00:34:55,719 --> 00:34:57,970
She is surrounded.

218
00:34:58,013 --> 00:35:00,639
The inquisitor demands blood.

219
00:35:06,688 --> 00:35:09,064
Then there is no more time.

220
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:16,864
What is our response?

221
00:35:16,907 --> 00:35:19,784
Go now.
Warn the queen.

222
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:23,287
- And you? Where are you going?
- He must be cut out.

223
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:25,998
- She has forbidden it.
- There is no other choice.

224
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:28,209
This is our only hope.

225
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:48,187
Stay. Stay.

226
00:36:09,042 --> 00:36:14,046
Our bodies are prisons for our souls.

227
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:21,136
Our skin and blood,
the iron bars of confinement.

228
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:25,432
But fear not.

229
00:36:25,475 --> 00:36:27,601
All flesh decays.

230
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:31,772
Death turns all to ash,

231
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:35,484
and, thus,

232
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:38,237
death frees every soul.

233
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:44,910
You, the condemned,

234
00:36:44,953 --> 00:36:47,788
you have confessed.

235
00:36:47,831 --> 00:36:52,585
You admit to protecting a queen

236
00:36:53,712 --> 00:36:56,922
who twists the word of God

237
00:36:56,965 --> 00:37:00,509
and drowns all Spain in sin.

238
00:37:01,761 --> 00:37:08,100
Your queen seeks immortality on Earth -
a false paradise.

239
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:10,978
This is heresy.

240
00:37:11,021 --> 00:37:13,522
She leads you towards vanity,

241
00:37:13,607 --> 00:37:16,525
away from the spirit.

242
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:19,069
But this is foolishness,

243
00:37:19,154 --> 00:37:21,614
for death exists.

244
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,116
The Day of Judgment is irrefutable.

245
00:37:24,993 --> 00:37:27,536
All life must be judged.

246
00:37:42,636 --> 00:37:44,678
- Why are you here?
- Come quickly.

247
00:37:44,763 --> 00:37:49,683
- Leave. Protect the queen.
- She sent me. She demands your return.

248
00:37:49,768 --> 00:37:53,646
- Not before he dies.
- No, Tomas. Leave him.

249
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,607
She desires a private audience.

250
00:37:56,691 --> 00:38:02,321
But fear not.
She will not be in hell alone.

251
00:38:02,364 --> 00:38:05,866
I will make sure
her servants are waiting for her.

252
00:38:58,753 --> 00:39:01,797
Faithful servant, why do you cry?

253
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:05,467
To see Spain brought so low,

254
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:10,431
with an enemy thriving within her borders,
feasting on her strength.

255
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:13,267
The shame is too much.
I've failed her.

256
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,644
Dare not pity Spain.

257
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:20,607
These times are dark,

258
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:26,113
but every shadow, no matter how deep,
is threatened by morning light.

259
00:39:26,156 --> 00:39:28,323
Of course.

260
00:39:28,408 --> 00:39:30,743
This loyalty of yours

261
00:39:30,785 --> 00:39:34,455
inspires you to protect Spain at any cost,

262
00:39:35,832 --> 00:39:38,917
but killing the inquisitor is suicide.

263
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:42,463
Europe would have my head.

264
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:47,760
I, for one, am not ready to die yet.
Are you?

265
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:50,429
I will die for Spain.

266
00:39:52,557 --> 00:39:55,100
I know, Conquistador.

267
00:39:55,143 --> 00:39:56,643
I know.

268
00:39:56,728 --> 00:40:00,773
And this bravery of yours,
it may save us yet.

269
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:05,360
For Spain has a plan.

270
00:40:05,445 --> 00:40:08,530
There is hope.

271
00:40:08,615 --> 00:40:11,241
- There's hope?
- Father.

272
00:40:31,054 --> 00:40:34,723
I am Father Avila
of her royal Franciscan order.

273
00:40:34,808 --> 00:40:37,476
Our allegiance remains with Spain.

274
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:39,478
Father.

275
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:42,189
Guards, leave us.

276
00:40:46,528 --> 00:40:48,362
Conquistador,

277
00:40:48,446 --> 00:40:54,451
I am going to tell you the true reason
why the inquisitor pits cross against crown.

278
00:40:55,453 --> 00:41:00,916
One year ago, Father Avila returned
from the jungles of New Spain

279
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,043
with a secret so great,

280
00:41:03,128 --> 00:41:06,630
it promised to free
all mankind from tyranny.

281
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:10,717
Spain desired this treasure
above all things,

282
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:14,179
but the inquisitor feared it
with equal measure.

283
00:41:14,222 --> 00:41:16,849
When I refused to give up my quest for it,

284
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:22,062
he responded with this violent coup
to bring Spain to her knees.

285
00:41:22,105 --> 00:41:24,815
But we have not yielded,

286
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:27,776
and now we will defeat him.

287
00:41:35,869 --> 00:41:39,246
This is our hope.

288
00:41:39,289 --> 00:41:43,250
- A dagger?
- Used in religious rituals.

289
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,170
I took it from a dead Mayan priest.

290
00:41:48,965 --> 00:41:51,258
The marking on the hilt...

291
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:56,096
Do you see it?

292
00:42:01,978 --> 00:42:04,104
It is a map.

293
00:42:04,731 --> 00:42:08,400
A map to the Mayans' greatest secret.

294
00:42:08,443 --> 00:42:13,780
Greater than Chichen Itzá, greater than
Yaxchilán, greater even than Tikal.

295
00:42:13,823 --> 00:42:18,869
Here, in the centre, in the core
of the once-great Mayan civilisation,

296
00:42:18,953 --> 00:42:23,373
we will find a lost pyramid.

297
00:42:24,417 --> 00:42:26,793
No.

298
00:42:26,836 --> 00:42:28,670
Not lost.

299
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:34,301
Hidden.
The hidden pyramid of the Mayan myths.

300
00:42:34,344 --> 00:42:37,804
The myths tell us of a holy pyramid,

301
00:42:37,889 --> 00:42:40,682
built upon the navel of the Earth,

302
00:42:40,767 --> 00:42:43,727
the birthplace of life.

303
00:42:44,771 --> 00:42:47,481
A special tree sprouts there.

304
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:52,945
They say whoever drinks of its sap

305
00:42:52,987 --> 00:42:55,906
will live forever.

306
00:42:57,492 --> 00:42:59,660
Eternal life?

307
00:43:00,828 --> 00:43:05,457
Spain hangs at the whims of a merciless
enemy and you taunt us with yarns?

308
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:08,126
They are not yarns.

309
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:11,421
Remember,

310
00:43:11,506 --> 00:43:13,924
our own Bible confirms it.

311
00:43:14,008 --> 00:43:17,928
In Genesis, there are two trees
in the Garden of Eden -

312
00:43:18,012 --> 00:43:21,723
the Tree of Knowledge
and the Tree of Life.

313
00:43:21,808 --> 00:43:25,185
When Adam and Eve disobeyed the Lord
and ate from the Tree of Knowledge,

314
00:43:25,270 --> 00:43:29,189
the Lord banned them from the garden
and hid the Tree of Life.

315
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:09,896
Could it be?

316
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:13,859
Kneel, Conquistador.

317
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:22,075
Let in the morning light.

318
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:41,720
The beast runs amok in my kingdom.

319
00:44:42,722 --> 00:44:45,640
He has isolated me,

320
00:44:45,725 --> 00:44:50,771
and now he is sharpening his talons
for one more fateful push.

321
00:44:52,065 --> 00:44:55,859
But salvation lies
in the jungles of New Spain.

322
00:45:12,835 --> 00:45:15,879
Will you deliver Spain from bondage?

323
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,882
Upon my honour and my life.

324
00:45:29,227 --> 00:45:34,147
Then you shall take this ring
to remind you of your promise.

325
00:45:37,151 --> 00:45:40,445
You shall wear it when you find Eden,

326
00:45:40,488 --> 00:45:43,031
and when you return,

327
00:45:43,116 --> 00:45:45,325
I shall be your Eve.

328
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:51,456
Together, we will live forever.

329
00:46:08,099 --> 00:46:09,933
Iz?

330
00:46:12,687 --> 00:46:14,563
Izzi?

331
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,966
- There you are.
- Hey, what are you doing here?

332
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:47,762
- Babe, we have Lipper at three.
- This is an actual Mayan book.

333
00:46:47,847 --> 00:46:53,310
Look. It explains their creation myth. You see,
that's First Father. He's the very first human.

334
00:46:53,394 --> 00:46:55,604
Is he dead?

335
00:46:55,688 --> 00:46:59,357
He sacrificed himself to make the world.

336
00:46:59,901 --> 00:47:03,028
- The Tree of Life's bursting out of his belly.
- Come on.

337
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:08,867
Listen. His body became the tree's roots.
They spread and formed the Earth.

338
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:12,913
His soul became the branches,
rising up, forming the sky.

339
00:47:12,997 --> 00:47:15,457
All that remained
was First Father's head.

340
00:47:15,541 --> 00:47:19,461
His children hung it in the heavens,
creating Xibalba.

341
00:47:19,545 --> 00:47:22,047
Xibalba? The star.

342
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,257
Nebula.

343
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,760
- So what do you think?
- About?

344
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,803
That idea.

345
00:47:28,888 --> 00:47:31,890
Death as an act of creation.

346
00:47:34,727 --> 00:47:36,853
Stay together, guys.

347
00:47:38,064 --> 00:47:41,608
I'll pull out the car
and meet you in front.

348
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:06,466
Iz. Iz!

349
00:48:31,534 --> 00:48:33,827
- Tommy.
- Hey.

350
00:48:35,496 --> 00:48:37,330
Tommy.

351
00:48:43,963 --> 00:48:46,590
You're all right.

352
00:48:48,426 --> 00:48:50,844
- I'm close.
- No.

353
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:52,679
There are options.

354
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:56,641
- We'll have to make some choices.
- Alan?

355
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:03,857
You had a minor seizure. The growth in
your brainstem's back and it's growing faster.

356
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:06,276
- The next time...
- No!

357
00:49:07,278 --> 00:49:08,820
No.

358
00:49:08,863 --> 00:49:11,072
We had a breakthrough.

359
00:49:11,157 --> 00:49:13,867
I know I can translate it to help you.

360
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,161
I just need a little more time, OK?

361
00:49:16,245 --> 00:49:19,581
There's hope.
There's real hope.

362
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:23,043
- Tommy.
- What? What, baby?

363
00:49:27,465 --> 00:49:30,383
- I wasn't afraid.
- I know.

364
00:49:30,468 --> 00:49:33,178
You're very strong.

365
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:35,055
No.

366
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:39,309
- No.
- What?

367
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,728
When I fell

368
00:49:43,648 --> 00:49:46,191
I was full.

369
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,487
Held.

370
00:49:52,448 --> 00:49:55,408
I know.
I caught you. I held you.

371
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:06,252
It's OK, Iz.
Everything's gonna be all right.

372
00:50:14,553 --> 00:50:16,638
There's time.
We have time.

373
00:50:46,836 --> 00:50:49,504
We need to examine
the hippocampal region.

374
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:53,633
- What the hell's going on?
- I brought in Dean Katari and Dr...

375
00:50:53,676 --> 00:50:55,593
I'm sorry, what are you doing here?

376
00:50:57,012 --> 00:51:02,559
- Antonio and Betty were just showing me...
- Donovan's synaptic growth increased.

377
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:06,062
His brain is identical to scans
from 12 years ago, when he was six.

378
00:51:06,564 --> 00:51:08,898
And the tumour?

379
00:51:13,404 --> 00:51:15,655
- Exactly. Please?
- Tommy...

380
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:18,199
Please!

381
00:51:18,284 --> 00:51:23,204
Perhaps you should wait for me in my office.
Manny. I'll be right there.

382
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:26,958
- Thomas, I'd like a word with you in private.
- After surgery.

383
00:51:39,346 --> 00:51:41,222
First cut.

384
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:47,103
Tommy.
Dr Lipperjust called.

385
00:51:47,188 --> 00:51:53,193
He said Izzi's doing better and they're gonna
move her to a regular floor in the morning.

386
00:52:07,458 --> 00:52:11,211
When we're done here,
I want you to prep Cain.

387
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:19,260
I'll get her.
She'll take care of it.

388
00:52:38,823 --> 00:52:41,908
What do you think you're doing?

389
00:52:41,992 --> 00:52:46,454
You don't abandon results like that.
You repeat the procedure, get a confirmation.

390
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:52,085
Confirmation that the tumour's unaffected?
She'll be dead by then.

391
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:54,170
Tommy.

392
00:52:57,675 --> 00:52:59,551
She had a seizure.

393
00:53:02,763 --> 00:53:05,265
I'm so sorry.

394
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:09,477
- How's she doing?
- She's stable.

395
00:53:10,813 --> 00:53:12,814
Who's with her?

396
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:16,901
- She's alone?
- She needs to rest.

397
00:53:16,986 --> 00:53:21,948
No one invents new drugs overnight. No one!
You're not being rational.

398
00:53:21,991 --> 00:53:24,951
- You can't fix everything!
- Don't tell me what I can do.

399
00:53:25,035 --> 00:53:31,207
- Your wife needs you. Why are you here?
- Why the fuck do you think I'm here?

400
00:53:39,800 --> 00:53:41,801
Shit.

401
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,452
I'll leave you two alone.

402
00:54:51,038 --> 00:54:53,915
Lilly, I'm sorry about before.

403
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:59,128
She's amazing.

404
00:55:01,799 --> 00:55:03,967
Lillian,

405
00:55:04,051 --> 00:55:06,594
could...

406
00:55:06,679 --> 00:55:10,723
could you have Henry
re-scan the animals for me?

407
00:55:10,766 --> 00:55:12,976
- OK.
- Thanks.

408
00:55:16,105 --> 00:55:18,106
- Hey.
- Hey.

409
00:55:19,817 --> 00:55:24,070
I brought your manuscript
in case you want to work.

410
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:31,536
How are you feeling?

411
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,371
Good.

412
00:55:37,584 --> 00:55:39,585
I'm sorry.

413
00:55:42,715 --> 00:55:44,757
What about?

414
00:55:52,641 --> 00:55:54,809
There's been progress at work.

415
00:55:56,937 --> 00:56:01,149
My conquistador.
Always conquering.

416
00:56:01,233 --> 00:56:05,737
- No. Something amazing. We tested...
- That's for you.

417
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:09,407
It's for me? What is it?

418
00:56:09,450 --> 00:56:11,492
Open it.

419
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:35,433
Pen and ink. For writing.

420
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:47,111
It's all done except the last chapter.

421
00:56:49,031 --> 00:56:51,032
I want you to help me.

422
00:56:51,992 --> 00:56:54,327
How?

423
00:56:54,369 --> 00:57:01,292
Finish it.

424
00:57:01,335 --> 00:57:03,878
- I don't know how it ends.
- You do.

425
00:57:05,005 --> 00:57:07,256
You will.

426
00:57:07,341 --> 00:57:09,342
Stop.

427
00:57:15,057 --> 00:57:18,392
- Remember Moses Morales?
- Who?

428
00:57:20,020 --> 00:57:23,314
- The Mayan guide I told you about.
- From your trip?

429
00:57:24,525 --> 00:57:28,694
The last night I was with him,
he told me about his father who had died.

430
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:30,780
- But Moses wouldn't believe it.
- Izzi!

431
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:34,492
No, no. Listen. Listen.

432
00:57:34,535 --> 00:57:38,204
He said if they dug his father's body up,

433
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:41,415
he would be gone.

434
00:57:42,668 --> 00:57:45,878
They'd planted a seed over his grave.

435
00:57:45,963 --> 00:57:47,964
The seed became a tree.

436
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:53,845
Moses said his father became part of that tree.

437
00:57:53,887 --> 00:57:58,349
He grew into the wood, into the bloom.

438
00:58:01,270 --> 00:58:04,605
And when a sparrow ate the tree's fruit,

439
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:08,192
his father flew with the birds.

440
00:58:09,945 --> 00:58:11,904
He said

441
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:17,160
death was his father's road to awe.

442
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:21,789
That's what he called it.

443
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:24,959
The road to awe.

444
00:58:26,879 --> 00:58:29,380
Now,

445
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:33,926
I've been trying to write the last chapter and
I haven't been able to get that out of my head.

446
00:58:33,969 --> 00:58:36,429
Why are you telling me this?

447
00:58:37,389 --> 00:58:39,932
I'm not afraid any more, Tommy.

448
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:56,365
I asked Lilly if I could be buried at her farm.

449
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:58,784
No, stop it!

450
00:59:01,205 --> 00:59:05,458
- I want you to be with me.
- I am with you. Look.

451
00:59:06,627 --> 00:59:09,003
I'll always be with you.

452
00:59:11,506 --> 00:59:13,216
I promise.

453
00:59:18,222 --> 00:59:21,182
Will you stay with me tonight?

454
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:25,353
Yeah. I'll stay.

455
00:59:33,153 --> 00:59:35,154
I'll stay.

456
01:00:24,913 --> 01:00:26,706
Don't worry,

457
01:00:27,541 --> 01:00:29,542
we're almost there.

458
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:37,508
Through that last dark cloud is a dying star.

459
01:00:41,221 --> 01:00:44,390
And soon enough, Xibalba will die.

460
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:49,312
And when it explodes,
you will be reborn.

461
01:00:51,648 --> 01:00:53,649
You will bloom.

462
01:01:00,032 --> 01:01:02,074
And I will live.

463
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:35,191
Don't worry.
We're almost there.

464
01:04:24,778 --> 01:04:28,572
Thank you, Lord! We are here!

465
01:04:31,493 --> 01:04:33,494
Circles.

466
01:04:34,663 --> 01:04:36,830
He leads us in circles.

467
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:42,211
Only we are left.
All of your countrymen are dead.

468
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:45,965
He killed them all with this blind quest.

469
01:04:48,969 --> 01:04:52,137
It's time. Time to stop him.

470
01:05:13,493 --> 01:05:16,495
Captain, we are lost.

471
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:20,499
The Franciscan and his tales are false.

472
01:05:20,584 --> 01:05:22,835
There is no hope for us here.

473
01:05:24,462 --> 01:05:26,422
There's only death.

474
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:31,844
- I've mapped us a course back to the ships.
- Coward.

475
01:05:32,679 --> 01:05:34,555
Damn the maps!

476
01:05:39,394 --> 01:05:41,937
We're close and I will find it.

477
01:05:42,022 --> 01:05:45,065
Captain! Captain! Captain!

478
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:47,860
Father. What is it, Franciscan?

479
01:05:48,862 --> 01:05:50,904
In the jungle...

480
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:53,365
The marking on the hilt.

481
01:05:53,450 --> 01:05:57,494
- On the dagger?
- It is the same. The same as on the stone.

482
01:06:18,058 --> 01:06:22,561
Your choice - die now
or, by my side, fight and live.

483
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:38,202
- You fool.
- Captain!

484
01:06:38,244 --> 01:06:40,329
Father.

485
01:06:40,413 --> 01:06:42,623
Take it.

486
01:06:42,707 --> 01:06:44,500
We are here.

487
01:06:44,584 --> 01:06:47,002
- Where?
- The temple is there.

488
01:06:52,801 --> 01:06:54,760
Sorry, Father.

489
01:06:55,929 --> 01:06:58,597
For you, there is only death.

490
01:07:00,058 --> 01:07:02,810
But our destiny is life.

491
01:07:29,295 --> 01:07:32,589
You shall wear it when you find Eden,

492
01:07:32,632 --> 01:07:37,177
and when you return,
I shall be your Eve.

493
01:07:47,480 --> 01:07:49,523
Iz! Iz!

494
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:57,698
Come on, come on, come on!

495
01:07:57,782 --> 01:08:00,159
Oh, no. Please! Please!

496
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:05,289
- Step aside.
- She's in V-fib. Pulse thready.

497
01:08:05,331 --> 01:08:07,458
- I'm bagging. Sir! Sir!
- Izzi! Izzi!

498
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:10,461
- Get the family out. Get him out!
- Sir, please!

499
01:08:10,503 --> 01:08:11,837
- Pads.
- Charging.

500
01:08:11,921 --> 01:08:13,046
- Pulse?
- Thready.

501
01:08:13,131 --> 01:08:14,339
Pressure?

502
01:08:18,553 --> 01:08:20,554
Oh, God.

503
01:08:41,868 --> 01:08:43,619
Tommy.

504
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:47,581
I know. I know.

505
01:08:47,665 --> 01:08:50,459
I've never seen anything like it.

506
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:52,836
- Antonio didn't reach you?
- What?

507
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:56,340
It's Donovan.
The growth is shrinking.

508
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:58,842
It's like the disease is cured.

509
01:09:01,554 --> 01:09:03,806
Izzi.

510
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:11,230
Izzi!

511
01:09:14,818 --> 01:09:17,402
- No, no, no, no!
- Sir. Please, sir.

512
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:18,654
Sir!

513
01:09:18,738 --> 01:09:22,699
Sir, it's too late.
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

514
01:09:22,742 --> 01:09:25,577
- Sir, it's too late.
- You killed my wife!

515
01:09:25,620 --> 01:09:28,497
- Get off him! Let go!
- Let go!

516
01:10:01,781 --> 01:10:06,285
No.

517
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:07,619
No!

518
01:10:07,662 --> 01:10:10,163
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

519
01:10:10,248 --> 01:10:12,791
Don't die! Don't die!
Don't die! Don't die!

520
01:10:12,876 --> 01:10:14,793
No! No!

521
01:10:14,836 --> 01:10:16,879


522
01:10:45,992 --> 01:10:52,497
It seems to me that we struggle
all our lives to become whole.

523
01:10:55,418 --> 01:10:58,045
Complete enough when we die

524
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:02,466
to achieve a measure of grace.

525
01:11:05,345 --> 01:11:07,346
Few of us ever do.

526
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:14,937
Most of us end up going out
the way we came in, kicking and screaming.

527
01:11:19,359 --> 01:11:24,154
But somehow Izzi, young as she was,

528
01:11:25,698 --> 01:11:28,450
she achieved that grace.

529
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:31,662
In her last days she became whole.

530
01:11:32,497 --> 01:11:34,539
She saw her...

531
01:11:35,708 --> 01:11:37,376
Tommy!

532
01:11:41,130 --> 01:11:43,632
- Tommy...
- Just stop it!

533
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:53,767
Death is a disease.
It's like any other.

534
01:11:53,851 --> 01:11:56,603
And there's a cure.

535
01:11:56,688 --> 01:11:58,105
A cure.

536
01:11:58,189 --> 01:12:00,691
And I will find it.

537
01:12:15,081 --> 01:12:16,289
No!

538
01:14:50,403 --> 01:14:52,404
All these years.

539
01:14:54,031 --> 01:14:56,366
All these memories.

540
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,163
There's been you.

541
01:15:12,008 --> 01:15:13,049
You...

542
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:15,427
You pulled me through time.

543
01:15:27,273 --> 01:15:29,065
Dr Creo?

544
01:15:46,292 --> 01:15:48,418
Dr Creo, we heard you were back.

545
01:15:49,462 --> 01:15:54,799
Update me on everything we know
about that tree. Every detail.

546
01:16:05,311 --> 01:16:07,979
I'm OK. Everything's fine.

547
01:16:10,483 --> 01:16:14,319
The Donovan breakthrough's
our starting point. It's a starting point.

548
01:16:14,362 --> 01:16:16,571
Right, let's build on it.

549
01:16:16,656 --> 01:16:19,157
Stop ageing, stop dying.

550
01:16:19,242 --> 01:16:21,451
Stop dying, that's our goal.

551
01:16:21,494 --> 01:16:25,247
Scans. Cultures. Charts.
Let's get to work.

552
01:16:31,545 --> 01:16:33,838
Come on, let's get to work.

553
01:17:01,826 --> 01:17:03,827
Xibalba.

554
01:17:13,212 --> 01:17:15,839
We're here.

555
01:17:41,574 --> 01:17:43,575
We almost made it.

556
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:53,960
I'm sorry.

557
01:17:54,045 --> 01:17:56,713
Finish it.

558
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:02,802
Stop it. Stop it!

559
01:18:04,680 --> 01:18:07,015
What do you want?

560
01:18:08,517 --> 01:18:10,518
Leave me! Leave me alone!

561
01:18:12,521 --> 01:18:15,607
Please, please. I'm afraid.

562
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:02,946
Will you deliver Spain from bondage?

563
01:19:05,908 --> 01:19:07,826
I don't know.

564
01:19:07,910 --> 01:19:10,328
I'm trying. I don't know how.

565
01:19:10,371 --> 01:19:12,497
You do.

566
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:15,667
You will.

567
01:19:18,087 --> 01:19:20,046
You do.

568
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,676
You will.

569
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:38,356
I'm not afraid any more, Tommy.

570
01:19:42,862 --> 01:19:45,113
I'm gonna die.

571
01:19:49,869 --> 01:19:52,287
I'm going to die.

572
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:55,457
Together we will live forever.

573
01:19:57,042 --> 01:20:23,443
Forever.

574
01:20:33,037 --> 01:20:35,497
We will live forever.

575
01:20:42,671 --> 01:20:45,215
Finish it.

576
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:48,843
OK.

577
01:20:51,597 --> 01:20:53,973
- What are you doing here?
- Take a walk with me.

578
01:20:54,058 --> 01:20:56,976
- I have to work.
- It's the first snow. We always...

579
01:20:57,061 --> 01:20:59,562
They're waiting on me.

580
01:20:59,605 --> 01:21:02,690
- Come on, Tommy.
- Please, Izzi.

581
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:06,945
I'm sorry. I am.

582
01:21:08,364 --> 01:21:10,448
I'll see you tonight, OK?

583
01:21:16,622 --> 01:21:17,789
Izzi.

584
01:21:17,873 --> 01:21:20,750
Hey! Dr Creo.
Antonio's on his way back.

585
01:21:21,585 --> 01:21:25,630
Donovan's open and ready.
His vitals are steady.

586
01:21:27,299 --> 01:21:29,634
Come on. Let's go.

587
01:21:32,680 --> 01:21:35,014
Dr Creo, where are you going?

588
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:38,560
Izzi!

589
01:21:38,686 --> 01:21:39,644
Izzi.

590
01:22:50,466 --> 01:22:52,467
No!

591
01:22:58,724 --> 01:23:01,392
Finish it.

592
01:24:05,082 --> 01:24:06,749
Behold.

593
01:26:29,810 --> 01:26:32,061
My queen.

594
01:26:33,146 --> 01:26:35,106
Now and forever.

595
01:26:35,941 --> 01:26:37,984
We shall be together.

596
01:29:56,600 --> 01:29:58,601
Bye, Iz.

597
01:30:12,491 --> 01:30:14,075
I finished it.

598
01:30:14,159 --> 01:30:16,577
Is everything all right?

599
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:18,746
Yes.

600
01:30:18,830 --> 01:30:20,873
Everything's all right.
