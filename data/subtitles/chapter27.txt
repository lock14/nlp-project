2
00:00:24,725 --> 00:00:25,851
Father.

3
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:27,349
Father.

4
00:00:33,434 --> 00:00:34,765
What is it?

5
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,365
What more must I do?

6
00:00:39,773 --> 00:00:42,901
What more must I do for your approval?

7
00:00:49,616 --> 00:00:53,382
I've done the best I can.

8
00:00:55,122 --> 00:00:59,149
What more must I do
to make you believe in me?

9
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,332
Tell me, Father.

10
00:01:07,634 --> 00:01:09,158
Tell me.

11
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:30,381
< Episode 2 7 >
This can't be happening. It just can't!

12
00:01:30,424 --> 00:01:33,587
How can he do this to us?

13
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:35,651
Is he torturing us?

14
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:38,295
Your Highness, calm down.

15
00:01:38,332 --> 00:01:40,266
How can I at a time like this?

16
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:43,032
What were you thinking?

17
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:45,861
Did you give up after one try?

18
00:01:45,906 --> 00:01:48,966
You should've tried again and again!

19
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:56,378
This is all my fault.

20
00:01:56,984 --> 00:02:01,512
My prayers weren't enough
to move the gods.

21
00:02:01,955 --> 00:02:03,650
You're right about that.

22
00:02:03,824 --> 00:02:07,191
Who made you Sorceress?

23
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:12,287
What happened once can happen again.

24
00:02:16,003 --> 00:02:20,804
Mother, please calm down.
I should've tried harder.

25
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,472
What do you mean? How much harder?

26
00:02:24,812 --> 00:02:27,246
You did something the King couldn't.

27
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:31,951
Your achievements are already
much greater than his.

28
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:40,817
- Your Highness. Don't say that.
- Why, am I wrong?

29
00:02:41,061 --> 00:02:43,222
I can't take it anymore.

30
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:47,528
If he won't give it to me,
I'll take it from him.

31
00:02:52,072 --> 00:02:55,667
I thought he'd accept the petition.

32
00:02:57,144 --> 00:02:58,907
It's not that simple.

33
00:03:00,347 --> 00:03:04,511
I quit the competition
and Daeso made a steel sword.

34
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:07,347
There's no reason to postpone it.

35
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,848
Why won't he make his mind up?

36
00:03:10,891 --> 00:03:15,954
The King is trying to
maintain his authority.

37
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,797
What do you mean?

38
00:03:20,968 --> 00:03:26,736
Figure out the power struggle
and you'll get what I mean.

39
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,475
I want you to remember that
the Queen and Daeso are upset.

40
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:38,580
It will work against you.

41
00:03:40,287 --> 00:03:45,281
They've done a lot in the past.
Goodness knows what they'll do next.

42
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,116
What more must I do?

43
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,053
What more must I do for your approval?

44
00:04:23,664 --> 00:04:27,498
I've done the best I can.

45
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:33,299
What more must I do
to make you believe in me?

46
00:04:35,309 --> 00:04:36,173
Father.

47
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:43,705
I feel as if I'm King Gou Jian,
sleeping on sticks and chewing gall...

48
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,685
while plotting his adversary's downfall.

49
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,850
I will use my anger...

50
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:53,556
to sharpen my sword of revenge.

51
00:04:54,728 --> 00:04:58,755
Until the day I wield that sword...

52
00:04:59,566 --> 00:05:03,525
I'll willingly withstand
all trials that come my way.

53
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:11,536
He was Daeso's weakness after all.

54
00:05:11,912 --> 00:05:16,872
I'm sure that's why
the King postponed the investment.

55
00:05:18,318 --> 00:05:22,880
Now that you have the chance,
it's your turn to attack.

56
00:05:23,824 --> 00:05:24,722
Attack?

57
00:05:24,925 --> 00:05:25,823
Yes.

58
00:05:26,593 --> 00:05:31,963
Now it's your turn to impress the King.

59
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:38,064
Searching Yuntabal's troop
did nothing for me.

60
00:05:38,572 --> 00:05:43,635
I didn't know Father and Daeso
trusted him so much.

61
00:05:45,245 --> 00:05:46,576
Your Highness.

62
00:05:47,314 --> 00:05:48,576
Go on.

63
00:05:50,417 --> 00:05:53,147
How about using them both?

64
00:05:54,054 --> 00:05:55,749
Use them both?

65
00:05:56,223 --> 00:05:59,920
For as long as you compete with them...

66
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,090
both princes are your opponents.

67
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:10,833
Now that Prince Jumong
is Head of Palace Bodyguards...

68
00:06:11,438 --> 00:06:15,670
he'll have just as much power
as Prince Daeso.

69
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:19,110
Use Jumong against Daeso...?

70
00:06:19,146 --> 00:06:20,670
That's it.

71
00:06:21,114 --> 00:06:26,950
Make them fight each other
and you'll emerge the winner.

72
00:06:27,454 --> 00:06:29,251
I'll be the winner...

73
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:32,690
Dochi.

74
00:06:33,026 --> 00:06:34,516
Yes, Your Highness.

75
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,720
You should be more than a merchant.

76
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:41,091
I'll make you my tactician.

77
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:46,028
Your Highness. I like being a merchant.

78
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:54,146
I'll just do all you say
while buying and selling goods.

79
00:06:55,449 --> 00:06:58,043
Then do as you want.

80
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:04,920
I should get going.

81
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,754
Then...

82
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:10,626
- Take care.
- Bye.

83
00:07:13,834 --> 00:07:15,927
My goodness...

84
00:07:15,969 --> 00:07:20,599
I've never used my brain so much before.

85
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:23,799
Sir, you were amazing.

86
00:07:23,944 --> 00:07:28,040
I'm so proud to be able to serve you.

87
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,613
You jerk!

88
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:37,120
You know how much I hate sweet talk.
How dare you talk to me like that?

89
00:07:37,557 --> 00:07:38,922
Why you...

90
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,352
OK.

91
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:45,959
- It's me, Jumong.
- Oh! Come in!

92
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:52,963
Welcome. Have a seat.

93
00:07:55,175 --> 00:07:56,142
Go on.

94
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,413
What's the occasion?

95
00:08:04,818 --> 00:08:09,255
Remember I wanted to congratulate you?

96
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,584
Here, have a drink.

97
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:16,093
But I'm still on duty.

98
00:08:16,463 --> 00:08:20,490
Who cares? Here you go. Go on.

99
00:08:25,872 --> 00:08:27,863
Let's drink.

100
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:36,109
Jumong.

101
00:08:37,951 --> 00:08:45,016
I've wanted to say
we should bury the hatchet.

102
00:08:48,528 --> 00:08:51,224
I know I've wronged you...

103
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,329
but we're in the same boat now.

104
00:08:57,003 --> 00:09:02,635
I too went through a lot
because of Daeso's selfishness.

105
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:09,307
Remember how hard he was on us?

106
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,482
I worked you up...

107
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:19,489
because I had no choice
but to give in to Daeso.

108
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:23,087
Take Buyoung for example.

109
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:27,498
That was all because
Daeso wanted to beat you so much.

110
00:09:31,871 --> 00:09:32,769
Oh.

111
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:39,535
And it was Daeso who made me
kill the man you met in the cave.

112
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,510
I didn't even know who he was.

113
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:53,618
As I said, we're on the same boat.

114
00:09:54,628 --> 00:09:58,189
Daeso forced us apart.

115
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:02,463
There's no reason for us
to be hostile towards each other.

116
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:03,701
Don't you agree?

117
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,031
Youngpo.

118
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,705
What is it?

119
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:12,237
We're both old enough
to take responsibility for our actions.

120
00:10:13,246 --> 00:10:20,175
Whether Daeso forced you or used you,
you should take responsibility now.

121
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:24,587
You're right.

122
00:10:26,793 --> 00:10:31,662
I want to bury the hatchet too.

123
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,962
Yes, let's. We should move on.

124
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:41,538
Such bad memories will just
get in the way of our bright future.

125
00:10:42,842 --> 00:10:43,706
But...

126
00:10:45,612 --> 00:10:47,443
There's one thing I can't forget.

127
00:10:49,049 --> 00:10:50,380
What's that?

128
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:55,045
You'll find out...

129
00:10:57,857 --> 00:10:59,791
my secret in due time.

130
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:07,057
I'm still on duty. I should get going.

131
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:09,226
OK...

132
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:14,796
We should do this again sometime. Bye...

133
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:28,911
Make my enemies fight each other...

134
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,355
It's so hard...

135
00:11:37,764 --> 00:11:38,753
Your Majesty.

136
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:42,234
Please don't put it off any longer.

137
00:11:43,036 --> 00:11:48,804
It's the best and only way
to calm the panic-stricken people.

138
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:55,904
Even the ministers are confused
because you keep putting it off.

139
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,540
It's dividing us up into factions.

140
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:05,581
Your Majesty, invest Prince Daeso.

141
00:12:07,727 --> 00:12:09,627
Are you my subject...

142
00:12:11,064 --> 00:12:12,292
or Daeso's?

143
00:12:14,801 --> 00:12:16,029
Your Majesty.

144
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:21,368
I only want what's best for you
and Puyo's royal family.

145
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:24,308
Please don't question my loyalty.

146
00:12:25,845 --> 00:12:30,407
Why do you think I'm putting it off?

147
00:12:35,722 --> 00:12:39,658
If I invest Daeso,
the power balance will shift...

148
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:43,195
in favor of the Queen
and her relatives in Maga.

149
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:46,895
You know that too, don't you?

150
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:55,171
And if that becomes reality...

151
00:12:55,208 --> 00:13:02,011
that'll be the end of the power
you've enjoyed for many years.

152
00:13:03,349 --> 00:13:05,010
Think about it.

153
00:13:06,052 --> 00:13:07,781
Your Majesty.

154
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:12,781
Like you said, I've enjoyed something
far beyond what I deserve.

155
00:13:13,726 --> 00:13:16,991
I'm not afraid of losing all I have.

156
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:24,068
I just want to stop the royal family
from drifting apart from the public.

157
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:30,234
Think of the confused people
and take my loyal advice.

158
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:09,146
How are things?
Do you like being bodyguards?

159
00:14:09,983 --> 00:14:12,781
Like Oi said,
I prefer living in the streets.

160
00:14:12,919 --> 00:14:16,355
Yes, Commander.
We have to be on guard at all times.

161
00:14:16,389 --> 00:14:18,619
It's really hard work.

162
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,453
It's not as bad as I thought.

163
00:14:22,729 --> 00:14:24,253
I thought so too.

164
00:14:24,297 --> 00:14:29,394
I'm sure all the rules and regulations
are making your lives hard.

165
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:34,563
I know but bear with me.

166
00:14:35,041 --> 00:14:36,668
Yes, Commander.

167
00:14:38,645 --> 00:14:43,014
There's something I need you to do.

168
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,117
We're at your service.

169
00:14:46,319 --> 00:14:51,484
The Hyunto blacksmiths add
a secret ingredient to the liquid iron.

170
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:54,251
Find out what that is.

171
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:04,763
Daeso's men guard the iron chamber
ever since they came here.

172
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:09,467
- You must be careful.
- We will be.

173
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:13,534
- Commander, this is Songju.
- Come in.

174
00:15:19,619 --> 00:15:21,678
His Majesty wishes to see you.

175
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:36,133
- You asked for me?
- We're leaving the Palace.

176
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,404
In the royal carriage?

177
00:15:39,606 --> 00:15:43,565
No. It'll be a short visit
to see how the people are.

178
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,806
I'll go in secret. Get ready.

179
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:49,742
I will, Your Majesty.

180
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:17,842
His Majesty and Prince Jumong
left the Palace.

181
00:16:18,144 --> 00:16:19,975
I'll follow them.

182
00:16:21,547 --> 00:16:24,744
- Forget it.
- Pardon?

183
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:31,779
He probably went to see how the people
are reacting to the rejected petitions.

184
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:37,528
Shouldn't we let him know
the people are on your side?

185
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,457
I'll get ready.

186
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,231
Don't.

187
00:16:43,069 --> 00:16:46,630
I don't want to stoop that low.

188
00:18:21,734 --> 00:18:22,428
Mari.

189
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:24,764
What is it?

190
00:18:38,651 --> 00:18:40,448
Pig or ox bone...

191
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:46,113
Found something?

192
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,532
Why is it so quiet?

193
00:19:05,378 --> 00:19:09,542
People don't come outside
since the omens appeared.

194
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:38,169
See what they're up to.

195
00:19:39,212 --> 00:19:40,270
OK.

196
00:20:02,735 --> 00:20:03,997
That'll do.

197
00:20:04,837 --> 00:20:10,332
Whatever evil strikes Puyo,
it will leave you unharmed.

198
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,502
You can go.

199
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:14,809
Thank you. Thank you so much.

200
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:25,490
He's a shaman warding off evil.

201
00:20:25,925 --> 00:20:26,857
Let's go.

202
00:20:27,093 --> 00:20:28,253
Warding off evil?

203
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:34,596
It's a new trend,
taking advantage of the confusion.

204
00:20:39,906 --> 00:20:41,100
Let's take a look.

205
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:42,563
Your Majesty.

206
00:20:43,276 --> 00:20:44,971
He's a mere shaman.

207
00:20:46,512 --> 00:20:48,104
Who represents the people.

208
00:21:00,293 --> 00:21:01,851
Anyone else?!

209
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:08,466
Water has turned to blood
and the rock is weeping.

210
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:12,660
There will be bloodshed.

211
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:19,803
No one is safe without my powers.

212
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:25,581
Come to me and save your life!

213
00:21:31,524 --> 00:21:32,957
How about me?

214
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,991
Will disaster strike me too?

215
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:45,559
The King abused the Shrine
and Yeomieul left Puyo.

216
00:21:46,172 --> 00:21:50,666
Who can avoid disaster
when the gods are angry?

217
00:21:52,144 --> 00:22:01,018
The Palace will pay
for bringing the gods' wrath upon us.

218
00:22:08,728 --> 00:22:10,787
What should I do?

219
00:22:11,063 --> 00:22:12,963
Buy an amulet.

220
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:19,567
Then you can escape
when disaster strikes.

221
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:22,330
I'll take one.

222
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:32,307
You want to escape danger for free?

223
00:23:03,015 --> 00:23:05,210
- Is that him?
- Yes.

224
00:23:06,152 --> 00:23:09,553
- Are you sure he's good?
- I'm sure of it.

225
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:17,185
- I can never trust shamans.
- You have nothing to lose anyway.

226
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:39,584
Sir! What's wrong?

227
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,085
Sir!

228
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:02,533
He's only making money
by bewildering the people.

229
00:24:03,008 --> 00:24:04,669
Don't mind him.

230
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:10,537
I'm the cause of their suffering.

231
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:13,781
I can't help but be heavy-hearted.

232
00:24:21,827 --> 00:24:22,589
Your Majesty.

233
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:25,722
What is it?

234
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:33,734
The people will get over it.
But you've forgotten something else.

235
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,741
AncientJosun's migrants.

236
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:49,180
I visited Hyunto, Imdoon and Jinbun.

237
00:24:49,555 --> 00:24:55,926
I saw tens of thousands
suffer under the Han's oppression.

238
00:24:58,164 --> 00:25:02,931
Those who'd escaped from Hyunto
didn't even want to come to Puyo.

239
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:14,344
You once led the Damul Army,
so they waited for you to rescue them.

240
00:25:14,513 --> 00:25:18,779
But now they've given up all hope.

241
00:25:22,988 --> 00:25:24,080
Your Majesty.

242
00:25:24,957 --> 00:25:27,391
Puyo's people will recover.

243
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:32,530
But who will look after
the poor suffering migrants...

244
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,492
who look forward to dying?

245
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:44,468
Have you really forgotten them?

246
00:26:02,494 --> 00:26:06,055
- This is confidential.
- Don't worry, Your Highness.

247
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:16,371
- Who was that for?
- Uncle Maga.

248
00:26:17,476 --> 00:26:19,535
About the Crown Prince investment?

249
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,038
Yes.

250
00:26:22,381 --> 00:26:27,341
The King rejected their last petition.

251
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,988
There's no point in trying again.

252
00:26:31,957 --> 00:26:33,948
Who said it's a petition?

253
00:26:37,896 --> 00:26:41,127
I'm going to force him instead.

254
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:48,602
I told them to ignore the King's orders
unless he invests you as Crown Prince.

255
00:26:49,441 --> 00:26:54,378
- Mother.
- The Jega rule Sachooldo.

256
00:26:54,613 --> 00:26:57,241
They have more soldiers than we do.

257
00:26:57,983 --> 00:27:04,388
The King is powerless
without their cooperation.

258
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:08,816
What if it backfires and leads to war?

259
00:27:09,295 --> 00:27:10,922
This is too dangerous.

260
00:27:12,298 --> 00:27:16,826
The King wouldn't dare
go to war against them.

261
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:18,836
Wait and see.

262
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:23,098
I will make him give in this time.

263
00:27:41,927 --> 00:27:42,791
Your Majesty.

264
00:27:43,495 --> 00:27:46,123
Puyo's people will recover.

265
00:27:46,532 --> 00:27:50,366
But who will look after
the poor suffering migrants...

266
00:27:50,402 --> 00:27:52,529
who look forward to dying?

267
00:27:52,905 --> 00:27:57,239
Have you really forgotten them?

268
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,081
Commander, this is Mari.

269
00:28:05,217 --> 00:28:06,149
Come in.

270
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,421
Commander.

271
00:28:13,659 --> 00:28:15,820
This is what we found.

272
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,817
Where will you go?

273
00:29:22,795 --> 00:29:25,855
It's time to go to Jolbon.

274
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:28,531
Inrang.

275
00:29:29,234 --> 00:29:30,633
Yes, Yeomieul?

276
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:35,099
Go to Puyo and
bring Soryung and Byuriha.

277
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:36,773
OK.

278
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:44,509
(Keru)

279
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,187
Hard, soft.

280
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:56,217
Hard, hard, soft, soft, hard.

281
00:29:56,261 --> 00:30:00,561
- Soft, soft, hard, hard, hard...
- Lady Sosuhno's here.

282
00:30:01,467 --> 00:30:02,798
Welcome.

283
00:30:04,870 --> 00:30:07,202
This is the Han blacksmith.

284
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:14,870
This is our director.

285
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:17,609
Teach him how to make steel swords.

286
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:37,936
You can't make a steel sword like this.

287
00:30:39,071 --> 00:30:42,302
That's why I want you to tell us how.

288
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:44,301
Wait.

289
00:30:44,743 --> 00:30:46,870
I can't tell you that.

290
00:30:47,112 --> 00:30:49,546
I'll tell you one thing.

291
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:52,715
You need to add something...

292
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:55,618
to galvanized iron to make pig iron.

293
00:30:55,654 --> 00:30:59,454
I don't think you know what that is.

294
00:31:01,059 --> 00:31:03,027
What's he saying?

295
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:08,627
You need to add something
to turn galvanized iron into pig iron.

296
00:31:09,134 --> 00:31:11,125
We don't have it here.

297
00:31:13,672 --> 00:31:15,606
Ask him what it is.

298
00:31:17,676 --> 00:31:19,166
He can't tell us.

299
00:31:19,945 --> 00:31:21,640
Dang...

300
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:25,049
What does he mean?

301
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:31,579
We melt iron ore
to make galvanized iron.

302
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:36,686
But it's so strong
it breaks whenever we temper it.

303
00:31:36,828 --> 00:31:39,922
That's why we can't make a decent sword.

304
00:31:44,670 --> 00:31:49,334
The secret to parching
lies in making pig iron.

305
00:31:49,541 --> 00:31:52,999
We need to add something
while melting the iron ore...

306
00:31:53,045 --> 00:31:55,104
we just don't know what that is.

307
00:31:57,583 --> 00:31:58,379
Miss.

308
00:32:00,485 --> 00:32:03,181
Our team in Hyunto got back to us.

309
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:21,496
Do you know what Daeso's deal was?

310
00:32:24,376 --> 00:32:29,245
He agreed to marry Yangjung's daughter
in return for the blacksmiths.

311
00:32:32,451 --> 00:32:37,753
He'll become Puyo's Crown Prince.
Who cares how many wives he has?

312
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,414
You want me to be his concubine?

313
00:32:42,761 --> 00:32:46,026
He doesn't know what you're like yet.

314
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:52,595
I wonder what he'll say
when he finds out I know about this.

315
00:32:54,006 --> 00:32:56,566
We should get back to Puyo.

316
00:32:57,042 --> 00:32:58,907
Tell Wootae to get ready.

317
00:32:59,611 --> 00:33:00,771
OK.

318
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:07,277
We sent steel weaponry to Jolbon
in return for gold and horses.

319
00:33:09,054 --> 00:33:13,491
Send the gold to the Capital
and the horses to the Iron Army.

320
00:33:13,525 --> 00:33:15,220
I will, Governor.

321
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:16,659
- Dongsun.
- Yes?

322
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:21,826
Select some skilled soldiers
who speak Puyo's language...

323
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:25,092
and teach them Puyo's customs.

324
00:33:25,470 --> 00:33:27,301
What for?

325
00:33:27,973 --> 00:33:29,964
I'll send them to Puyo.

326
00:33:31,143 --> 00:33:32,337
You mean...

327
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:37,139
I'm going to send some spies.

328
00:33:38,016 --> 00:33:39,415
I see.

329
00:33:50,162 --> 00:33:51,322
Guess what this is.

330
00:33:59,337 --> 00:34:01,601
It's from Prince Daeso.

331
00:34:03,508 --> 00:34:04,668
That's nice.

332
00:34:05,911 --> 00:34:08,277
Do you like him?

333
00:34:09,381 --> 00:34:10,439
Yes.

334
00:34:11,083 --> 00:34:13,551
Ambitious men tend to disregard women.

335
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:17,285
But I'm glad he shows his interest.

336
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,584
Yangsullan.

337
00:34:20,325 --> 00:34:21,349
Yes?

338
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:27,493
Thank you for agreeing to marry him
without giving me a hard time.

339
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:32,563
(Yangsullan, Yangjung's daughter)
I complied with it for my sake.

340
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:39,473
Despite your talents,
all you can be is a mere governor.

341
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:44,907
When I become Puyo's Queen
I'll invite you to Puyo.

342
00:34:45,984 --> 00:34:48,077
I'll make it up to you.

343
00:34:50,722 --> 00:34:51,586
Very well.

344
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:55,757
Then I'll make Daeso the King of Puyo.

345
00:34:57,462 --> 00:35:04,959
You'll have him wrapped round
your finger so you'll be the real king.

346
00:35:17,215 --> 00:35:18,443
What do you know?

347
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:23,250
Like you said, they're making
steel weapons with Puyo's director.

348
00:35:24,189 --> 00:35:27,625
(Songyang, Piryu chief)

349
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:30,190
What is Sosuhno up to?

350
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:32,990
She's preparing to return to Puyo.

351
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:46,339
Kill her the minute she leaves.

352
00:35:47,379 --> 00:35:48,505
OK, chief.

353
00:36:22,347 --> 00:36:23,439
Attack!

354
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,117
Are you OK?

355
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:39,315
I'm fine.

356
00:37:39,758 --> 00:37:44,024
I bet it was one of the chiefs.

357
00:37:44,829 --> 00:37:46,694
We should get out of here fast.

358
00:38:02,247 --> 00:38:03,077
Miss!

359
00:38:11,056 --> 00:38:11,988
Wootae!

360
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,184
Wootae!

361
00:38:16,261 --> 00:38:17,319
Wootae!

362
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:20,389
Wootae...

363
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:21,554
Wootae!

364
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:27,971
Wootae!

365
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:34,070
Wootae.

366
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:35,875
Wootae...

367
00:38:47,792 --> 00:38:48,622
How is he?

368
00:38:49,728 --> 00:38:55,132
I did the best I could
but the poison has spread.

369
00:38:55,767 --> 00:38:57,701
We have to wait and see.

370
00:38:58,003 --> 00:39:00,301
Wait and see?

371
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:05,540
You should do all you can to save him!
What do you mean wait and see?

372
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:08,705
- Dang!
- Kepil. Calm down.

373
00:39:09,848 --> 00:39:11,076
Thank you.

374
00:39:13,051 --> 00:39:15,815
Wootae...

375
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:22,315
Wake up, will you? My goodness...

376
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,158
Wootae...

377
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:27,596
Oh, Wootae...

378
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:31,162
Wootae...

379
00:39:49,988 --> 00:39:52,115
Miss, how is he?

380
00:39:53,191 --> 00:39:54,715
In critical condition.

381
00:39:55,827 --> 00:39:59,319
Who would do such a terrible thing?

382
00:40:00,765 --> 00:40:05,099
I think I know. Want to make a guess?

383
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:06,802
Who is it?

384
00:40:08,139 --> 00:40:11,631
I sent Sayong to check.
We'll find out soon.

385
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:17,038
Found anything?

386
00:40:17,515 --> 00:40:21,645
Yes. It's the Piryu chief,
just as you predicted.

387
00:40:21,853 --> 00:40:24,014
(Yangtak, Keru's temporary leader)

388
00:40:26,724 --> 00:40:28,419
Summon the soldiers.

389
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:33,087
Miss. You should tell your father first.

390
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:37,265
This may spark a tribal war.

391
00:40:38,837 --> 00:40:40,270
There's nothing to fear.

392
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:44,270
I'll show them what happens to...

393
00:40:45,009 --> 00:40:47,239
a tribe that stands against Keru.

394
00:41:05,597 --> 00:41:06,529
You wretch.

395
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:09,291
How dare you insult me?

396
00:41:09,701 --> 00:41:11,464
Where are your manners?

397
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:13,461
Chief.

398
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:19,603
I haven't even started yet.
Please don't say that.

399
00:41:21,946 --> 00:41:23,743
What will you do to me?

400
00:41:24,582 --> 00:41:29,884
What happens to you
depends on what happens to Wootae.

401
00:41:31,089 --> 00:41:34,547
If Wootae dies so will you.

402
00:41:35,627 --> 00:41:37,254
If he recovers...

403
00:41:38,029 --> 00:41:40,862
you get a second chance.

404
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:47,096
I think you should pray to the gods.

405
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:50,264
Escort him away.

406
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:52,105
Yes, Miss!

407
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:11,956
Wootae...

408
00:42:13,565 --> 00:42:15,465
Please wake up.

409
00:42:32,116 --> 00:42:33,083
Miss.

410
00:42:33,918 --> 00:42:36,250
Oi, Mari and Hyupbo are here.

411
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:51,000
Prince Jumong sent this to Mopalmo.

412
00:42:51,035 --> 00:42:52,627
- Oi.
- OK.

413
00:43:02,647 --> 00:43:05,844
(Keru iron chamber)

414
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:24,127
What's wrong?

415
00:43:25,503 --> 00:43:27,130
Powdered bones...

416
00:43:27,872 --> 00:43:31,171
ground up seashells...
I've tried everything.

417
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:34,470
How about this?

418
00:43:35,413 --> 00:43:36,744
That too.

419
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:42,486
Thanks anyway.

420
00:43:43,655 --> 00:43:45,953
How's Prince Jumong?

421
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:47,980
Good.

422
00:43:49,127 --> 00:43:52,893
I'll do everything I can.

423
00:43:54,299 --> 00:43:56,164
Tell him to hang in there.

424
00:43:57,035 --> 00:43:59,230
Carry on then.

425
00:44:01,572 --> 00:44:02,402
- Musong.
- Huh?

426
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:04,237
- Take care.
- Bye.

427
00:44:06,511 --> 00:44:08,103
I'll throw this away then.

428
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:20,787
Wait! Wait! Wait!

429
00:44:21,993 --> 00:44:23,051
Hang on.

430
00:44:32,603 --> 00:44:35,766
Isn't this ocher?

431
00:44:38,242 --> 00:44:40,233
I haven't tried this yet.

432
00:44:52,357 --> 00:44:54,325
Miss! Miss!

433
00:44:55,159 --> 00:44:56,751
Yeomieul is here.

434
00:45:30,228 --> 00:45:32,059
He's near death.

435
00:45:32,563 --> 00:45:35,191
Bring me the secret medicine.

436
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:36,558
I will.

437
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:43,194
How is he?

438
00:46:45,703 --> 00:46:47,796
He's gained consciousness.

439
00:46:48,706 --> 00:46:53,302
Thank you. Thank you.

440
00:46:53,444 --> 00:46:55,275
Thank you...

441
00:46:57,482 --> 00:47:02,215
We've prepared a Shrine.
Please go and rest.

442
00:47:03,754 --> 00:47:05,016
- Kepil.
- Huh?

443
00:47:05,056 --> 00:47:08,514
- Escort her, please.
- OK, OK.

444
00:47:08,559 --> 00:47:10,550
This way...

445
00:47:18,236 --> 00:47:19,601
Bring the Piryu chief.

446
00:47:20,104 --> 00:47:21,298
OK.

447
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:33,542
Untie him.

448
00:47:33,918 --> 00:47:34,782
OK.

449
00:47:41,859 --> 00:47:46,296
The gods didn't forsake you after all.

450
00:47:47,331 --> 00:47:50,528
Wootae made it.

451
00:47:53,404 --> 00:47:58,899
I will never forget what you did to me.

452
00:47:59,977 --> 00:48:01,740
Please don't.

453
00:48:02,680 --> 00:48:07,344
I'll have to remind you if you do.

454
00:48:11,088 --> 00:48:12,487
Let him go.

455
00:48:12,957 --> 00:48:14,356
OK, Miss.

456
00:48:14,525 --> 00:48:15,583
Let's go.

457
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:55,060
From now on, I will accept
all Ancient Josun migrants...

458
00:48:55,099 --> 00:48:58,364
who wish to settle in Puyo.

459
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:02,803
Your Majesty.

460
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:06,968
This will affect our ties with the Han.

461
00:49:07,645 --> 00:49:10,808
We almost attacked Okjuh for their salt.

462
00:49:10,982 --> 00:49:15,646
This might lead to
an all-out war against the Han.

463
00:49:16,854 --> 00:49:19,152
Prince Daeso is right.

464
00:49:19,557 --> 00:49:23,425
No other country will take them in.

465
00:49:23,561 --> 00:49:26,655
We shouldn't take the lead.

466
00:49:27,665 --> 00:49:32,762
I will take them in
because no other nation will.

467
00:49:33,404 --> 00:49:39,570
The Han have used
and abused the migrants.

468
00:49:40,077 --> 00:49:43,103
They have nowhere to go
even if they do escape.

469
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:48,979
We'll give them hope, a reason to live.

470
00:49:50,721 --> 00:49:55,283
Anyone who dares to object
will be considered...

471
00:49:56,427 --> 00:50:00,227
a subject of Han, so be careful!

472
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:09,137
Chief General.

473
00:50:09,974 --> 00:50:11,134
Yes, Your Majesty.

474
00:50:12,176 --> 00:50:14,303
Order all the sentries...

475
00:50:14,879 --> 00:50:20,408
to protect those who enter our borders
from pursuing Han soldiers.

476
00:50:20,985 --> 00:50:22,316
I will, Your Majesty.

477
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:34,528
The migrants?

478
00:50:34,999 --> 00:50:36,193
Yes, Your Highness.

479
00:50:36,233 --> 00:50:41,296
The Chief General was ordered to
protect those who enter Puyo.

480
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:47,205
Everything is going
as Yeomieul predicted.

481
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:52,011
His Majesty is ruining Puyo.

482
00:50:54,151 --> 00:50:58,781
I'm actually rather glad.
This might just work out...

483
00:51:01,258 --> 00:51:03,283
The Queen is here.

484
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:11,732
Sit down.

485
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:19,298
- Have you heard the news?
- Yes, Your Highness.

486
00:51:20,845 --> 00:51:22,813
What do you think about this?

487
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:27,111
Accepting the migrants
means going to war against the Han.

488
00:51:27,518 --> 00:51:31,978
All the evil omens
are finally coming true.

489
00:51:32,189 --> 00:51:35,920
We're not ready to accept the migrants.

490
00:51:36,560 --> 00:51:41,088
But His Majesty is willing to go to war.

491
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:45,666
No one can make him change his mind.

492
00:51:45,836 --> 00:51:50,136
But if he doesn't
we will lose to the Han.

493
00:51:50,174 --> 00:51:52,233
We must stop him.

494
00:51:53,210 --> 00:51:55,110
I want you to take charge.

495
00:51:58,382 --> 00:52:00,543
What authority do we have...?

496
00:52:01,385 --> 00:52:02,784
What do you mean?

497
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:09,619
You must tell him what you all think
even if he ignores you.

498
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:15,191
Only then will the people know
what the gods want.

499
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,192
What did you say?

500
00:52:19,003 --> 00:52:24,134
The gods want me to reject
the migrants entering Puyo?

501
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:29,674
- Your Majesty, if you accept them...
- Mauryung!

502
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:32,142
Yes, Your Majesty.

503
00:52:33,784 --> 00:52:37,743
Do you know why Yeomieul left?

504
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:45,494
Because she acted against my will,
just like you are now.

505
00:52:46,463 --> 00:52:51,628
Do you want to end up like her?

506
00:52:53,437 --> 00:52:54,870
Leave me at once!

507
00:53:04,582 --> 00:53:08,450
Your Majesty.
We have a messenger from Sachooldo.

508
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:10,617
Let him in.

509
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:18,890
This is a petition signed by
all the Sachooldo Jega.

510
00:53:52,563 --> 00:53:58,433
The ministers, the Shrine and the Jega.
Opposition is stronger than I thought.

511
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:04,196
I put you on the spot.

512
00:54:06,143 --> 00:54:11,274
Not at all. The migrants
aren't the only reason.

513
00:54:12,116 --> 00:54:16,450
Everyone's attacking at once,
as if they've been lying in wait.

514
00:54:17,521 --> 00:54:23,357
Backing out now might mean
giving up my throne.

515
00:54:29,633 --> 00:54:33,433
I won't tolerate that.

516
00:54:41,478 --> 00:54:43,810
Commander, we're back.

517
00:54:44,581 --> 00:54:45,741
Come in.

518
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:57,588
We gave the powders to Mopalmo
but I don't think it'll do any good.

519
00:55:01,966 --> 00:55:04,434
He's tried them all before.

520
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:11,765
But he did tell you not to worry.
He's trying his best.

521
00:55:13,377 --> 00:55:14,537
Well done.

522
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:18,445
Is Sosuhno well?

523
00:55:19,216 --> 00:55:22,151
We escorted her back to Puyo.

524
00:55:32,730 --> 00:55:34,061
We're back.

525
00:55:34,732 --> 00:55:36,393
Good job.

526
00:55:37,968 --> 00:55:39,595
How's Wootae?

527
00:55:40,738 --> 00:55:43,730
Much better,
thanks to Yeomieul's treatment.

528
00:55:44,241 --> 00:55:49,235
I heard you imprisoned the Piryu chief.
Why did you do that?

529
00:55:49,546 --> 00:55:51,446
If that leads to war then...

530
00:55:51,482 --> 00:55:52,744
Well done.

531
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,848
Yuntabal, if this leads to war...

532
00:55:55,886 --> 00:55:59,253
Then we go to war,
if that's what it takes.

533
00:56:06,797 --> 00:56:07,559
Miss.

534
00:56:31,655 --> 00:56:36,115
- I have a favor to ask.
- Anything you want.

535
00:56:37,828 --> 00:56:42,390
I'd like all the information you have
on Jinbun and Imdoon.

536
00:56:44,101 --> 00:56:49,869
Tell me what it's for.
I'll select the documents you need.

537
00:56:50,507 --> 00:56:54,375
Give me all you have.
I'll select what I need myself.

538
00:56:57,514 --> 00:56:59,379
I'll get them ready.

539
00:57:02,619 --> 00:57:06,555
Why do you need all this?

540
00:57:09,193 --> 00:57:14,062
As you know, Jinbun and Imdoon
are much weaker than they used to be...

541
00:57:14,198 --> 00:57:15,995
when they became commanderies.

542
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:18,961
They don't even have
a permanent governor.

543
00:57:19,103 --> 00:57:22,766
Even the people
are moving to other regions.

544
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:30,938
This is the perfect time
to attack Imdoon and Jinbun.

545
00:57:32,483 --> 00:57:34,542
You want to go to war?

546
00:57:35,052 --> 00:57:35,950
Yes.

547
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:41,116
I'm going to look into it
and persuade the King.

548
00:57:43,093 --> 00:57:45,459
It could lead to a war against the Han.

549
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:50,289
They're still fighting the Southwest Yi.

550
00:57:50,534 --> 00:57:55,403
They can't send reinforcements
even if we do attack.

551
00:59:37,140 --> 00:59:41,042
What was that?
What's that clanging noise?

552
00:59:44,448 --> 00:59:46,040
Watch closely.

553
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:01,288
Mopalmo!

554
01:00:07,738 --> 01:00:08,796
I did it.

555
01:00:10,173 --> 01:00:12,141
I did it...

556
01:00:14,044 --> 01:00:15,807
Don't just stand there.

557
01:00:16,513 --> 01:00:21,473
I must take this to Prince Jumong.

558
01:00:21,718 --> 01:00:22,946
Now!

559
01:00:50,947 --> 01:00:54,542
Commander. Mopalmo is here.

560
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:02,284
Your Highness.

561
01:01:02,459 --> 01:01:04,689
Mopalmo. What's going on?

562
01:01:05,462 --> 01:01:06,724
I did it.

563
01:01:07,264 --> 01:01:08,959
I did it.

564
01:01:11,635 --> 01:01:17,130
I made a steel sword that doesn't break.

565
01:01:24,915 --> 01:01:28,078
Are you serious?

566
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:32,320
Yes, Your Highness. This is it.

567
01:01:48,538 --> 01:01:51,029
- Oi.
- Yes, Commander.

568
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:58,310
Is your sword the one Daeso made?

569
01:01:59,149 --> 01:02:00,047
Yes.

570
01:02:04,755 --> 01:02:05,619
Step forward.

571
01:03:01,378 --> 01:03:02,345
Commander...

572
01:03:06,817 --> 01:03:07,943
It broke...

573
01:03:11,121 --> 01:03:12,179
Commander!

574
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:19,125
Mopalmo!

575
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:22,059
Your Highness!

576
01:03:39,716 --> 01:03:41,581
I have something to tell you.

577
01:03:42,252 --> 01:03:43,742
Take a seat.

578
01:03:50,160 --> 01:03:51,457
What is it?

579
01:03:53,697 --> 01:03:57,827
I've been looking into
Jinbun and Imdoon.

580
01:04:22,225 --> 01:04:26,093
What is this report for?

581
01:04:28,565 --> 01:04:32,057
Give me some troops.

582
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:37,002
I'll attack Jinbun and Imdoon
and save the migrants.

583
