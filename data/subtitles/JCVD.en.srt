1
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,960
It didn't work.

2
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:43,930
It didn't work.

3
00:03:44,889 --> 00:03:46,469
In the middle there...

4
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,719
It's all in mist...

5
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:53,009
The window didn't
explode right...

6
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:57,099
and it is very difficult for me
to do everything in one shot.

7
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,810
You know, I'm 47 years old...

8
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,909
Just because he brought
John Woo to Hollywood

9
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:11,030
doesn't mean he can rub my dick
with sandpaper.

10
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:17,790
He still thinks
we're making Citizen Kane?

11
00:04:19,259 --> 00:04:23,970
Not using a gun symbolizes
the whole purity of the character.

12
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,430
The purity...

13
00:04:43,279 --> 00:04:45,519
This isn't about the adults...

14
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:48,079
We're talking about a child,

15
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,569
an environment...

16
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,120
My client...

17
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,920
is aware...

18
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:01,550
of responsibilities
of raising a child.

19
00:05:02,009 --> 00:05:04,629
She leads a quiet,
peaceful life.

20
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,399
On the other hand,
we have an actor here

21
00:05:06,439 --> 00:05:08,589
who's obviously disgruntled.

22
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,720
Whose known past problems
I just mentioned

23
00:05:12,889 --> 00:05:15,180
are less than ambiguous.

24
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:17,560
And whose entire
career experience

25
00:05:18,189 --> 00:05:20,430
is with films
whose values

26
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:22,740
no responsible
aware parent

27
00:05:22,769 --> 00:05:24,560
would ever want to
expose their children to,

28
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,730
including myself, Your Honor.

29
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,870
Violence...

30
00:05:32,449 --> 00:05:34,610
that's all on film,
Your Honor.

31
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,699
The legitimacy
of violence...

32
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:39,629
How does this actor
play death?

33
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,370
Let me count
the ways.

34
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,800
Mangled under the wheels
of a truck...

35
00:05:48,259 --> 00:05:49,720
Strangulation...

36
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,639
Fracturing the skull...

37
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,759
Taking out the 'tibula'....

38
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:02,569
They were low budgets. Every one
of my movies were having heart!

39
00:06:03,689 --> 00:06:05,149
Laceration...

40
00:06:06,569 --> 00:06:08,860
Crushed under
the wheels of a car...

41
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:11,949
Death by strangulation...
Crushed ribs...

42
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,910
I make money with this!
I feed them!

43
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:18,329
- Please be seated.
- It's all about money!

44
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,160
- Allez, one more! Again.
- Gauging out the eye...

45
00:06:21,379 --> 00:06:22,660
Kicks to the groin...

46
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:24,879
Can I go to the
restroom, please?

47
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:28,459
Crushed under the
wheels of a truck...

48
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,300
Gauging out the eyes...

49
00:06:32,139 --> 00:06:33,470
Crushing the skull...

50
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,439
Shit.

51
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:54,990
- Take off! Immediately! Take off!
- Alright!

52
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,120
See the Arab in the film?

53
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,589
See that beard? Ever seen one
like that on a plane or a bus?

54
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:08,709
You think I look like him?

55
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,209
The movie's from 1986...

56
00:07:12,389 --> 00:07:16,629
Haven't you ever had an idea just
to realize you've seen it before?

57
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:20,889
Chuck Norris giving Ben Laden
the idea of 9-11, that's bull!

58
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:23,519
But Chuck Norris
works for the CIA.

59
00:07:23,689 --> 00:07:25,100
Yesterday it was Schwarzy...

60
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:29,019
Seen how the Arabs in "True Lies"
get all excited like hyenas?

61
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,949
Action films need bad guys.

62
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:35,060
Exactly! In the 70's,
it was the Viets, now the Arabs.

63
00:07:36,699 --> 00:07:39,409
Stallone in "Rambo 3",
Hauer in "Wanted: Dead or Alive",

64
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:41,240
Bruce Willis in "The Siege",

65
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,579
Steven Seagal in
"Executive Decision"?

66
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:47,250
And what's his name,
Mark Wahlberg who fights in Iraq?

67
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,829
- Van Damme!
- He never hit Arabs!

68
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:51,629
Dummy, Van Damme's outside!

69
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,420
Hey, Mr Van Damme! Wait!
I'm a great fan of yours!

70
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,840
- How are you?
- Fine and you?

71
00:07:57,019 --> 00:07:59,639
- What's this? Lost in Schaerbeek?
- Going to the post office.

72
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:02,269
A quick snap for the store?

73
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:04,430
Thanks, sir!
Look, it's Van Damme!

74
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:05,439
Hello!

75
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,680
Don't hello him.
Just take the picture.

76
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:10,689
Yeah!

77
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,980
Your turn, now.
Jean-Claude Van Damme!

78
00:08:16,949 --> 00:08:18,149
Good?

79
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:21,610
Wait, my grandma
adores you too...

80
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:23,069
In five minutes!

81
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:26,750
Thanks, sir. Wow!
It was Jean-Claude Van Damme!

82
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,370
He's cool! I pictured him taller,
but he's short.

83
00:08:30,629 --> 00:08:33,000
He's cool! Classy and all!

84
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,000
He's all tanned.

85
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:36,720
He'll be right back.

86
00:08:36,889 --> 00:08:39,509
- He cured cancer or what?
- Why? Did you?

87
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:42,169
- No, but nobody kisses my ass.
- He's a star!

88
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:44,389
He left this shithole,
for Hollywood.

89
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,059
He fought to be
where he is now.

90
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,220
You've never left town!

91
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,649
Whether you're a star or a dog,
I don't care!

92
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:54,860
Then why are you waiting for him?
You can't park here!

93
00:08:55,029 --> 00:08:58,980
He's just a regular guy.
Back off, watch my car!

94
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:01,529
Calm down, ma'am!

95
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,700
Move back!
I don't wanna see you around here.

96
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:07,789
- Help me, sir.
- You can't park here.

97
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:10,370
- Only 10 minutes!
- She's waiting for her idol.

98
00:09:10,549 --> 00:09:12,460
- Who's the idol?
- Jean-Claude Van Damme.

99
00:09:12,629 --> 00:09:14,419
- Who?
- Jean-Claude Van Damme!

100
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:15,919
Get outta here!

101
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:17,710
"Aware!"

102
00:09:17,889 --> 00:09:19,720
Look, we have pictures.

103
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:22,049
- How is he?
- He's nice.

104
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:24,759
He's just a regular guy, sir.

105
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,230
I don't think so.
The guy's a star.

106
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:30,070
He left this shithole
for Hollywood...

107
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:32,110
He fought to get
where he is now.

108
00:09:32,279 --> 00:09:35,029
You've never even left town!

109
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,610
So what?
Bunch of ass-kissers...

110
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:40,200
What'd you say?

111
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:42,080
I was talking to them.
Help me!

112
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:44,740
I was talking to
them, I swear!

113
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,580
You have a flat here.
Registration!

114
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,960
- Oh, come on!
- Registration!

115
00:09:49,129 --> 00:09:52,000
- Don't ruin my day, please!
- Registration!

116
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,879
- I always get the crap, thanks!
- Anytime!

117
00:09:56,049 --> 00:09:57,840
You owe me big time!

118
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:03,509
Shut up!

119
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:11,230
For once, it's not my fault!

120
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:13,190
Please, ma'am. Shut up!

121
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,320
Stop now.

122
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,490
Don't stay here!

123
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,240
Get lost!

124
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:32,580
You heard me!

125
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:35,919
Shit...

126
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,139
Open! What's going
on in there?

127
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,549
What's going on!

128
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,120
On the ground!

129
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:10,639
Central to Unit 27.

130
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:14,980
Jean-Claude Van Damme's robbing
a post office. I need back-up.

131
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,649
Possible hostage situation.
I repeat

132
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:19,389
possible hostage situation.

133
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,990
1. The Answer
before the Question.

134
00:12:29,039 --> 00:12:31,990
He's in court
for his daughter's custody.

135
00:12:32,169 --> 00:12:35,000
And he can't approach
his ex-wife...

136
00:12:35,169 --> 00:12:36,080
He picked up!

137
00:12:36,419 --> 00:12:37,700
He picked up!

138
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:47,000
Please, move, convince...
Perfect.

139
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:48,879
Mr Van Damme?

140
00:12:55,269 --> 00:12:58,059
This is Commissioner Bruges.
How are things inside?

141
00:13:01,029 --> 00:13:02,519
It could be better.

142
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:04,610
OK, let me ask you first,

143
00:13:04,779 --> 00:13:06,409
is anyone injured?

144
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:11,110
Hello?
Jean-Claude?

145
00:13:11,409 --> 00:13:12,240
No, no.

146
00:13:13,330 --> 00:13:15,159
A man's unconscious
and bleeding.

147
00:13:16,789 --> 00:13:19,629
Jean-Claude,
may I call you Jean-Claude?

148
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,009
I'm Commissioner Christian Bruges.
Call me Christian.

149
00:13:24,009 --> 00:13:25,970
You have to release
the wounded man.

150
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:30,809
It's not in your interest, nor mine,
to have blood on our hands.

151
00:13:42,779 --> 00:13:44,360
Will you release him?

152
00:13:44,610 --> 00:13:46,519
No, no one leaves.
It's impossible.

153
00:13:53,830 --> 00:13:56,200
What if I came with
a doctor? Hello?

154
00:13:56,830 --> 00:13:58,029
Jean-Claude?

155
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:00,539
What if I came with a doctor?

156
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:01,659
Fine, but unarmed.

157
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:04,000
I give you my word.

158
00:14:04,169 --> 00:14:05,340
Commissioner Bruges?

159
00:14:05,509 --> 00:14:07,250
Call me a doc please!

160
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:12,009
- Lieutenant Perthier, SWAT team.
- I just spoke with Van Damme.

161
00:14:12,179 --> 00:14:16,309
So, I'm going inside and then,
we'll debrief, if necessary.

162
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,019
- I'd like to deploy my men.
- No, it's too soon.

163
00:14:19,190 --> 00:14:21,230
Could I borrow a vest?

164
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:22,559
I'll give it back.

165
00:14:22,730 --> 00:14:23,809
Jackie.

166
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:24,940
A doctor, please.

167
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:30,200
I asked for a doc!

168
00:14:30,409 --> 00:14:31,399
Get me a doc!

169
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,070
Eric went to med school.

170
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,159
- OK, let's go.
- Boss!

171
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:42,539
Hello? Jean-Claude?

172
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,250
No!

173
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:47,259
You have my word that...

174
00:14:49,509 --> 00:14:52,179
Jean-Claude,
we're here to find...

175
00:14:59,059 --> 00:14:59,929
What?

176
00:15:36,929 --> 00:15:38,590
We see the chief of police

177
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:41,429
exiting the video store,
crisis unit HQ,

178
00:15:41,610 --> 00:15:45,389
and going towards the post office
in his boxer shorts.

179
00:15:45,649 --> 00:15:48,940
Is Van Damme
trying to mock the police?

180
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:52,899
In any case,
it seems to be working

181
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,360
as the public
is rooting for him

182
00:15:55,830 --> 00:15:58,370
in spite of today's events.

183
00:15:59,669 --> 00:16:02,120
The shorts! The shorts!

184
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,200
Don't shoot, I'm a hostage!

185
00:17:13,779 --> 00:17:15,490
Drop the kit.

186
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:20,150
Slide it over.

187
00:17:23,539 --> 00:17:24,740
Check the kit.

188
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:45,630
Go to the back room.

189
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,400
Hurry! He's bleeding!

190
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,740
No tricks, Jean-Claude.

191
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:06,569
Van Damme's fame
has driven them here.

192
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:09,700
They're clearly fans,
here to support him,

193
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:14,089
and the slightest move
gets the crowd on fire,

194
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:15,720
yelling out his name.

195
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,299
We've heard a few snide remarks,
like the one about the Commissioner

196
00:18:20,509 --> 00:18:24,099
who went out in his shorts.
But the situation is dramatic.

197
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:29,690
Sir, don't move.

198
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:35,480
What am I doing here?
What's going on?

199
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:37,150
Calm down, sir.

200
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,740
- Don't move.
- It hurts.

201
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:42,200
What the fuck...

202
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,279
No, Jean-Claude!

203
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:01,970
Don't move!
Get outta here!

204
00:19:03,180 --> 00:19:04,509
Calm down, Jean-Claude!

205
00:19:06,019 --> 00:19:07,049
Get outta here!

206
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:12,519
The curtain!
Help them!

207
00:19:24,829 --> 00:19:25,740
Right on!

208
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,950
Gimme five! Awesome!
How did you do that?

209
00:19:29,119 --> 00:19:30,700
Seriously! What a pro!

210
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:31,660
What's this?

211
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:32,950
See what he did?

212
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,420
This isn't a movie!
What do I care?

213
00:19:35,589 --> 00:19:38,380
Take him with the others!
Fast!

214
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:40,460
Listen, smart-ass,

215
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,920
you better think of something
or I'll shoot...

216
00:19:44,099 --> 00:19:45,839
How do you do it Jean-Claude?

217
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:49,299
You got him in the balls
with your foot and your hand!

218
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,509
You're too fast for
me, I swear.

219
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,440
Sit down, you deserve it.

220
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,960
Hey!

221
00:20:19,339 --> 00:20:21,220
Can't you see he
saved his life!

222
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:23,920
He saved all of us!

223
00:20:24,259 --> 00:20:26,259
Jean-Claude!
He's still out cold.

224
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,559
What a fag.

225
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:34,180
Find a way to get
us outta here

226
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:37,019
or I'll shoot 1 per hour,
starting with our hero.

227
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:38,109
They're clueless.

228
00:20:39,490 --> 00:20:40,569
We can ask anything...

229
00:20:43,619 --> 00:20:45,279
like a ransom
with him as hostage.

230
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:48,069
Let's ask for a million!

231
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,319
A million?
Where did you see a million?

232
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,910
Have you even seen a million?

233
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:55,619
Where are you?
In a post office!

234
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,079
He's a star!
I mean, it's Van Damme!

235
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:00,049
They expect more than a mill.

236
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,839
We leave
with him and the cash.

237
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:10,509
So the hostages can go to the cops
once we're out!

238
00:21:16,109 --> 00:21:17,769
Talkin' about a brain...

239
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,480
You almost got me killed!

240
00:21:21,779 --> 00:21:23,319
- You realize?
- Listen...

241
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,569
I'd be dead!

242
00:21:24,779 --> 00:21:26,109
You're not the FBI!

243
00:21:26,279 --> 00:21:29,450
- I'm still the boss.
- Go to Hollywood for drama!

244
00:21:29,619 --> 00:21:30,400
I work, here!

245
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:34,109
Fuck your action men in black!
They're no better than us.

246
00:21:34,369 --> 00:21:35,829
Let's just shoot him.

247
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,329
That's not our job!
We're here to save lives!

248
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:42,789
- So maybe that's what it takes.
- This isn't a war!

249
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,880
You're telling me
how to do my job?

250
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:47,430
Can't you just shut up?

251
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:51,009
The gendarmes are gonna show up.
Get lost!

252
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:52,759
Yeah, get outta here.

253
00:21:59,519 --> 00:22:02,190
What are you laughing at?

254
00:22:04,069 --> 00:22:05,190
And the kid?

255
00:22:06,990 --> 00:22:08,109
The kid...

256
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:10,910
we take him with us.

257
00:22:11,789 --> 00:22:16,000
Know anyone that would want to have
a dead kid on their conscience?

258
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:17,609
Yes.

259
00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:30,259
Boss!

260
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,259
- The blood...
- Yes, Jean-Claude?

261
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,140
It's because of your crap.

262
00:22:38,309 --> 00:22:42,769
No, I have nothing to do with this.
The SWAT team decided alone...

263
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,059
I swear, I wouldn't have...

264
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,980
- I have a list of demands.
- Yes.

265
00:22:47,069 --> 00:22:48,150
You have to do something

266
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,359
about the kid first.

267
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:52,240
The kid,

268
00:22:52,490 --> 00:22:53,769
you have to release him.

269
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:55,500
Negative.

270
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:58,569
- You have enough hostages!
- Cut the crap!

271
00:22:58,789 --> 00:23:00,789
- You want the list or not?
- Yes, I'm listening.

272
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,210
You have enough hostages!

273
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,000
I want a million euros
in small bills.

274
00:23:06,799 --> 00:23:09,170
Unmarked,
with different serial numbers.

275
00:23:09,799 --> 00:23:11,509
I want a bus for the airport,

276
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:16,880
a jet with a full tank. Destination
to be confirmed once I'm on board.

277
00:23:18,099 --> 00:23:19,730
Then, I'll release
the hostages.

278
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:22,099
You're asking a
lot, Jean-Claude.

279
00:23:22,269 --> 00:23:24,269
Honestly, you realize that...

280
00:23:30,160 --> 00:23:31,700
- It won't work.
- What?

281
00:23:31,869 --> 00:23:36,359
I'm Jean-Claude Van Damme.
It makes no sense, it's all bullshit.

282
00:23:36,539 --> 00:23:38,369
It should be less realistic.

283
00:23:38,539 --> 00:23:40,000
Like what?

284
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:42,200
Wait, I have an idea.

285
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:47,170
I'll also need
465,000 dollars...

286
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:48,839
Yeah.

287
00:23:49,180 --> 00:23:50,799
...to be delivered by noon.

288
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:55,430
To the firm Bernstein,
Katz and Phillis...

289
00:23:58,940 --> 00:23:59,799
He hung up.

290
00:24:01,099 --> 00:24:02,430
What's that? A code?

291
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:03,849
No, it makes more sense.

292
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:04,940
Who are those guys?

293
00:24:05,109 --> 00:24:07,069
- My attorneys in LA.
- Don't mess with me.

294
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,609
Dumbass.
He's in court for the custody...

295
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:11,859
Shut up!
You leave them all alone!

296
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,779
- Change the tone.
- Shut up.

297
00:24:15,950 --> 00:24:17,359
- Watch it, OK?
- Go back!

298
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,700
- I'm not your baby brother!
- Go!

299
00:24:20,539 --> 00:24:22,700
Look, Carradine,
I'll go when I'm ready.

300
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,130
Go back, your idol's coming.
Ass-kisser, get lost!

301
00:24:26,299 --> 00:24:27,539
I'm staying.

302
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,250
Now, I'm going.

303
00:24:30,589 --> 00:24:31,539
OK, then go!

304
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,420
He's right. A movie star
asking for a million...

305
00:24:34,849 --> 00:24:36,039
it's ridiculous.

306
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:39,470
But a star asking for money
to pay for his law fees

307
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,640
sounds desperate.

308
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,470
Not bad, not bad at all.

309
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:45,809
Go back with the others.

310
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,769
I said, beat it!

311
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,500
Look at those idiots!

312
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,079
So: 1 + 1 = 1.
It's still you.

313
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,710
- It's love.
- 2 in 1.

314
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:11,829
But for us:
1+1 = 2 and 2+2 = 4.

315
00:25:12,009 --> 00:25:15,509
Then we're 'selfish',
we take money without sharing it.

316
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:20,059
But if 1+1 = 1...
Or maybe 1+1 = 11.

317
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:21,509
That's beautiful!

318
00:25:21,690 --> 00:25:23,680
I just got back
from Belgium today,

319
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:26,019
I was at my mother's and...

320
00:25:26,230 --> 00:25:28,440
What was the name he said,
in English?

321
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,730
- Bernstein.
- What?

322
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,150
Leon Bernstein.

323
00:25:36,579 --> 00:25:40,440
We don't think horizontal,
we think vertical.

324
00:25:40,619 --> 00:25:42,000
We stand straight in life.

325
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:45,000
We don't think in hours
and in seconds, it's 'neutral'.

326
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:48,200
The snake, Adam and Eve,
I don't buy it anymore.

327
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:52,130
A snake is nice.
An apple's good, it contains pectin.

328
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,670
It's good for cholesterol.

329
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,009
Can an apple hurt a woman?

330
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,670
Some people failed,

331
00:25:59,849 --> 00:26:03,220
because they're not 'aware'.

332
00:26:03,390 --> 00:26:07,440
They don't acknowledge
that they exist.

333
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:11,650
Poor things, they don't know.
So, I'm 'aware', I'm awake.

334
00:26:11,819 --> 00:26:12,680
What's "aware"?

335
00:26:12,859 --> 00:26:15,980
You wake up
wondering what you're doing...

336
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,569
No, it's fine.

337
00:26:18,329 --> 00:26:22,319
Dolphins use wave-lengths too,
they're smart in the sea.

338
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:23,869
We live in the earth.

339
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:26,789
They communicate,
since they don't blah-blah-blah...

340
00:26:31,589 --> 00:26:34,160
Gloria, would you rather live
with your mommy

341
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,039
or your daddy?

342
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:43,430
I don't wanna live with Dad.

343
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,640
Why, Gloria?

344
00:26:49,019 --> 00:26:53,759
Every time my dad is on a TV Show,
my friends make fun of me.

345
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,940
- But you love your daddy?
- Yes.

346
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,980
But you'd rather stay
with your mom.

347
00:27:03,579 --> 00:27:06,250
I want them to stop
making fun of me.

348
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,160
Thank you, Gloria.
You may be excused.

349
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,279
I think it's November
10th or 15th.

350
00:27:42,490 --> 00:27:44,660
There's no special
requirements,

351
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:46,819
you don't have to
do any training,

352
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:48,700
You don't have to be in
any kind of good shape...

353
00:27:48,710 --> 00:27:51,400
They'll put you in
shape on the shoot.

354
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:54,369
- The commission?
- Huh?

355
00:27:54,549 --> 00:27:56,210
- What's your commission?
- Normal.

356
00:27:56,339 --> 00:27:57,829
No, no. The one I was...

357
00:27:58,759 --> 00:28:01,799
10%...
but I'll take 8.

358
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:04,420
They'll kill my career,
those guys.

359
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:08,849
You get good money, they send me
to Bulgaria, in the fucking factory.

360
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:11,470
They're making the movie for, like, what?
A million dollars?...

361
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,019
No, no!
You're exaggerating...

362
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:14,980
With the 30% sales fee...

363
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:17,690
You're exaggerating that.
This movie is huge in Asia!

364
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:19,849
I know,
6 million dollars!

365
00:28:20,859 --> 00:28:23,869
Foreign, 30%: 1.8

366
00:28:24,029 --> 00:28:27,650
producing fee:
1.250 million... OK?

367
00:28:27,869 --> 00:28:29,279
Why do you do this shit to yourself?
That's my job...

368
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:32,240
I get paid 4 million dollars,
how much is left for the picture?

369
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:34,289
Come on, man! That is my job.
Let me worry about that.

370
00:28:34,460 --> 00:28:38,509
I would take less money
and put me in a fucking studio!

371
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:41,759
If they get me for free,
one movie only, for free, "Van Damme".

372
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:44,299
It's worth at least
6 in Europe!

373
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:45,269
They pay me scale,

374
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,220
at least I would be in a big movie
and would give me the chance...

375
00:28:48,390 --> 00:28:50,599
And you have those
contacts with the studio!

376
00:28:51,019 --> 00:28:52,150
What's going on here?

377
00:28:52,150 --> 00:28:54,720
Wait a minute, you're not
seeing the big picture...

378
00:28:54,900 --> 00:28:56,940
No, the big picture,
you're selling package!

379
00:28:57,109 --> 00:28:59,230
Yeah, but so does
the director involved,

380
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,980
and there's a cinematographer
involved, what's the matter?

381
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,730
Jeff, how many years you've known me?
20 years?...

382
00:29:05,369 --> 00:29:08,400
Once in your life,
put me in a studio!

383
00:29:09,289 --> 00:29:10,529
What are you,
bullshitting me or what?

384
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:14,700
I mean, I've never done bad by you!
I've always done the right thing by you!

385
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,079
And that's no bullshit.

386
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:20,039
Look... You're an international
fucking movie star!

387
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:22,559
Name me another
international movie star.

388
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:26,640
You work all the time,
you're well protected...

389
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,890
I lost my daughter.

390
00:29:34,230 --> 00:29:36,549
You're gonna get over that.

391
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:38,940
Remember Shakespeare:

392
00:29:39,109 --> 00:29:41,809
"Time and the hour
through the longest day...

393
00:29:41,839 --> 00:29:44,019
...everything passes".

394
00:29:44,990 --> 00:29:48,279
You've gotta believe me
here, man, life goes on.

395
00:29:48,619 --> 00:29:50,410
Especially in this town...

396
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:51,859
Stop it.

397
00:29:53,619 --> 00:29:54,900
Stop it.

398
00:29:58,589 --> 00:30:00,380
You want to
smoke a joint?

399
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,339
Jean-Claude, come on,
it was a joke!

400
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:13,779
Look, can't you take a joke?

401
00:30:13,789 --> 00:30:16,059
Don't forget: you start
shooting on November 10th.

402
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,309
I love you, baby!
Keep that mojo working!

403
00:31:30,099 --> 00:31:32,339
The check
you made bounced.

404
00:31:32,509 --> 00:31:35,220
- What do you mean?
- You know exactly what I mean.

405
00:31:35,259 --> 00:31:36,470
It's impossible!

406
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,450
If I don't get the money by noon,
I'll have to drop the case.

407
00:31:42,589 --> 00:31:44,730
Ok, don't drop
the case.

408
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:48,839
I promise you,
I'll get the money. Ok? Thank you.

409
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:51,779
- You've been told...
- Yes, at noon. Ok, fine.

410
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:20,890
Hey, I'm a great
fan of yours!

411
00:32:21,059 --> 00:32:22,309
- How are you?
- Fine and you?

412
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,519
- What's this? Lost in Schaerbeek?
- Going to the post office.

413
00:32:25,690 --> 00:32:27,769
A quick snap for the store?

414
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:30,269
Thanks, sir!
Look, it's Van Damme!

415
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,650
Don't hello him.
Take the picture first.

416
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:42,829
Thanks guys.

417
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,579
Wait, my grandma
adores you too!

418
00:32:45,750 --> 00:32:47,630
I'll be back in five minutes!

419
00:33:40,269 --> 00:33:42,940
Name's Van Damme.
How's it going?

420
00:33:43,849 --> 00:33:46,519
Hello.
Can I come in? I have a...

421
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,730
No, no, you can't,
we're closed.

422
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,059
- Closed?
- Yes.

423
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:52,940
But it's not six yet?

424
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:59,029
Please, it's very important.
I'm expecting a transfer.

425
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,869
Yes, but we can't...

426
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,150
No, seriously!

427
00:34:03,329 --> 00:34:04,359
A computer problem.

428
00:34:04,539 --> 00:34:08,710
Seriously? This can't be.
No, it's important, I have to...

429
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:10,670
Tomorrow, we'll let you in.

430
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:14,920
No, I need to go in today.
Listen, it's very important.

431
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:18,670
I need this money
for my family here, you understand?

432
00:34:19,889 --> 00:34:21,510
Let me speak to the boss.

433
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,769
- Quickly, then.
- It'll take a sec. Thanks.

434
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:41,900
Hello, ma'am, how are you?

435
00:34:43,789 --> 00:34:45,199
I'm here for a transfer.

436
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:47,780
The name's Jean-Claude
Van Varenberg.

437
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,500
Not my stage name Van Damme.

438
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:54,469
I'm sorry,
but we're out of cash today.

439
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:56,760
I told you, Mr Van Damme!

440
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:59,920
No, you told me
it was a computer problem.

441
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:04,179
Is it a cash or a computer problem?
You pick...

442
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,769
Listen, please give
me my money.

443
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:13,440
I have no money, my credit cards
don't work. Nothing works.

444
00:35:15,489 --> 00:35:17,199
We're out of cash.

445
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,230
It's impossible.

446
00:35:19,739 --> 00:35:22,070
This is a bank!
It's only 11, noon?

447
00:35:22,239 --> 00:35:25,829
I'm broke, I have no money
and my cards don't work!

448
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:26,949
C'mon, sir.

449
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,369
Wait, what's your name?

450
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:30,949
Arthur.

451
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:33,829
Listen, I haven't
slept in two days,

452
00:35:34,010 --> 00:35:37,010
jet lag, the Los
Angeles court,

453
00:35:37,179 --> 00:35:41,130
the planes, a toy store,
my Mom on the phone, the cab,

454
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:44,469
the tip...
Wait, I have an idea.

455
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:46,309
I have a solution.

456
00:35:47,139 --> 00:35:48,849
Then, collect some money.

457
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:51,809
I'm a good client here.
I'm pretty loaded.

458
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:56,150
Why don't you ask people here
for $700 or even $650?

459
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:59,320
And tomorrow take it
out of my bank account.

460
00:36:00,369 --> 00:36:01,820
But, I can't!

461
00:36:03,869 --> 00:36:06,909
- You don't give a shit, uh?
- No, I just can't!

462
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:11,989
I want my fucking money!

463
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:15,989
I'm sick of this,
I want my money!

464
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,260
It's like this
since yesterday.

465
00:36:18,469 --> 00:36:22,550
I have no cash on me.
Van Damme without cash! Gimme a loan.

466
00:36:22,719 --> 00:36:26,170
Hey, I haven't slept,
I got on a plane...

467
00:36:26,349 --> 00:36:29,099
I just got back from
a 'child custody' thing.

468
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:34,230
Look, I'm exhausted, guys.
Help me out here.

469
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,690
First the cab, then the toys...
Please, help me!

470
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,860
- OK, c'mon now.
- What? Where?

471
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,070
Camera?

472
00:36:47,619 --> 00:36:48,949
Camera?

473
00:36:49,869 --> 00:36:51,199
Is this candid camera?

474
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:53,820
Sorry, guys, sorry!

475
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,949
Listen, I've had a bad day,
I haven't slept in two days.

476
00:36:58,130 --> 00:37:00,539
Cut this one,
it's a 'bad take'.

477
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:03,880
Put him with the others!

478
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:07,389
Are you nuts?
It's Jean-Claude Van Damme!

479
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:10,300
C'mon! Get up now!

480
00:37:11,769 --> 00:37:14,260
I said, get up!
Faster!

481
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:16,559
Faster! Move faster!

482
00:37:24,739 --> 00:37:26,980
Come and sit over here.

483
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:35,199
Shit, what did he do to you!
Breathe. Breathe, Jean-Claude.

484
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,670
Wow! How do you
develop your triceps?

485
00:37:45,849 --> 00:37:46,800
I can't.

486
00:37:47,059 --> 00:37:47,840
Watch out!

487
00:38:07,780 --> 00:38:09,579
Get up! Get up!

488
00:38:09,949 --> 00:38:12,280
The curtain!

489
00:38:12,460 --> 00:38:14,199
- What?
- The curtain!

490
00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:17,199
Don't move! Shut up!
Lower your arms!

491
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,460
You too, shut up!
Lower your arms!

492
00:38:26,550 --> 00:38:28,130
Gimme a hand, here.

493
00:38:28,679 --> 00:38:30,719
Gimme a hand! Come!

494
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:37,809
What's going on?

495
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,719
Don't stay here! Get lost!

496
00:38:44,909 --> 00:38:46,099
Open up!

497
00:38:50,739 --> 00:38:51,780
What's going on?

498
00:38:54,250 --> 00:38:55,159
Open up!

499
00:38:56,789 --> 00:38:58,039
Look down.

500
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,539
You too, look down.

501
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,670
What are you looking at?

502
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,329
Look over there!

503
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,710
Open up!

504
00:39:40,670 --> 00:39:41,829
What are you doing?

505
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,639
- Are you crazy?
- He was coming in.

506
00:40:03,820 --> 00:40:06,940
How are we gonna get out now?
He's gonna call back-up!

507
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:09,190
Maybe, but I'm not
turning myself in!

508
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:12,730
I'm not in Belgium to be jailbait!
Watch it!

509
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,579
Don't do that again!

510
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,579
I just wanted to see
how he was doing.

511
00:40:20,750 --> 00:40:23,619
- Shit, I almost shot him!
- OK, sit down!

512
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:30,840
Robbing a bank in Belgium
can't be that hard!

513
00:40:31,010 --> 00:40:33,469
Shit! What are we
gonna do now?

514
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:36,639
Leave now, while
you still can.

515
00:40:37,929 --> 00:40:39,309
- He's right!
- Shut up!

516
00:40:41,150 --> 00:40:42,389
Turn yourselves in.

517
00:40:42,559 --> 00:40:46,309
In any case, we all saw
the gunshot was an accident.

518
00:40:46,489 --> 00:40:49,570
If I want some stretching tips,
I'll call you.

519
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:51,610
Well done!

520
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:55,699
You can insult me all you want
or even hit a hostage,

521
00:40:55,869 --> 00:40:57,530
but I'm not
turning myself in!

522
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,909
We gotta block the exits.

523
00:41:00,619 --> 00:41:03,289
You keep an eye on them
and cut the crap!

524
00:41:03,460 --> 00:41:06,079
You're saying that
a man broke in...

525
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:09,880
and then you say
he got in with a key!

526
00:41:10,050 --> 00:41:12,760
We gotta be clear
on this one,

527
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:16,050
otherwise,
it'll be a false statement.

528
00:41:16,969 --> 00:41:18,519
If you say he was drunk,

529
00:41:18,679 --> 00:41:22,929
I won't know for sure
until the alcohol test has been done.

530
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:25,059
It's as simple as that.

531
00:41:25,269 --> 00:41:27,429
Boss, guess who's robbing
the post office!

532
00:41:27,610 --> 00:41:28,389
Who?

533
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:32,610
I liked how you pressured
the hostages earlier.

534
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,280
It wasn't for them.

535
00:41:34,949 --> 00:41:37,110
You heard Karate Kid.
If we cooperate...

536
00:41:37,289 --> 00:41:38,739
Listen up, brainiac.

537
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:40,989
Who said it was a
perfect plan,

538
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:43,619
that post offices
are like the Red Cross,

539
00:41:43,789 --> 00:41:45,500
and that we'd catch
the 12:43 train?

540
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:46,530
But, the moron...

541
00:41:46,710 --> 00:41:49,289
The moron's your pal,
not mine.

542
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,750
So, if you wanna be
the boss...

543
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:10,940
If you wanna be the boss
and keep giving orders,

544
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:14,400
you'd better start growin' some balls
otherwise, I'm taking over.

545
00:42:14,570 --> 00:42:17,280
And I don't mind
getting my hands dirty.

546
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:30,760
Commissioner! Please!

547
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,960
Hey, it's
Commissioner Bruges!

548
00:42:33,130 --> 00:42:35,090
Is Van Damme the perp?

549
00:42:35,260 --> 00:42:36,800
Wait. No declaration yet.

550
00:42:36,969 --> 00:42:38,349
Has anyone been shot?

551
00:42:40,429 --> 00:42:42,840
How many hostages
are held inside?

552
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:48,010
- Enough.
- What's your plan?

553
00:42:48,190 --> 00:42:50,230
No, please!
Get him outta here!

554
00:42:54,820 --> 00:42:56,199
Be careful with the seats.

555
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:02,409
Careful! You know how much
I can sell it for on eBay?

556
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:13,340
No, nothing's moving.

557
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:16,000
Can he turn that off?

558
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,050
- The whining thing?
- The nerves.

559
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,889
- Is that him?
- Yes.

560
00:43:25,349 --> 00:43:27,010
Did he dye his hair?

561
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:43,739
He's in shock.

562
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:47,030
- What?
- He's still in shock.

563
00:43:47,369 --> 00:43:49,869
Once in the film
"Hard Target",

564
00:43:50,039 --> 00:43:52,289
I took a shot from a blank.

565
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,920
It took salts to
reanimate me.

566
00:43:55,260 --> 00:43:57,880
"Hard Target"! John Woo!

567
00:43:58,050 --> 00:44:00,039
- What an ass!
- Don't say that!

568
00:44:00,219 --> 00:44:02,460
C'mon, Jean-Claude,
wait a sec!

569
00:44:02,639 --> 00:44:04,719
He's the one who brought him
to the US.

570
00:44:04,889 --> 00:44:08,969
Without him, he'd still be
filming pigeons in Hong Kong!

571
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:11,760
And then what?
He drops you!

572
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:14,969
At least, he did "Face Off".

573
00:44:15,150 --> 00:44:17,559
So what?
He could have picked you!

574
00:44:18,409 --> 00:44:22,980
On the other hand, when you see
"Windtalkers", there's a justice...

575
00:44:23,989 --> 00:44:25,570
Got any new projects?

576
00:44:26,039 --> 00:44:27,449
Not for now.

577
00:44:27,619 --> 00:44:30,659
I saw a thing on the web,
what's it called?

578
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,789
Purple.
"Purple Amulet".

579
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:37,539
What about it?

580
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:40,130
- Steven Seagal got the part.
- What?

581
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:41,579
He got the part.

582
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:42,679
Steven Seagal?

583
00:44:42,849 --> 00:44:44,550
You're ten times better!

584
00:44:47,309 --> 00:44:49,469
Well, he cut off his couette.

585
00:44:49,639 --> 00:44:50,969
His what?

586
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:52,340
His couette.

587
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,309
His ponytail!

588
00:44:55,900 --> 00:44:57,230
For the first time!

589
00:44:57,610 --> 00:45:00,070
Oh, I see...
That's a tough one...

590
00:45:02,659 --> 00:45:05,280
Hey you! What's that?
What are you doing?

591
00:45:05,789 --> 00:45:07,070
- Me?
- Yeah, you!

592
00:45:07,250 --> 00:45:08,699
- Hey!
- He coughed.

593
00:45:08,869 --> 00:45:10,250
No. You're disturbing us!

594
00:45:10,420 --> 00:45:11,739
I think he just coughed.

595
00:45:12,170 --> 00:45:14,039
- He coughed!
- Think I'm funny?

596
00:45:14,210 --> 00:45:16,250
- No.
- You think I'm funny!

597
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:17,829
No.

598
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:20,409
- Oh, is he funny?
- No.

599
00:45:20,590 --> 00:45:23,460
So, I see.
It's the 'aware' thing, is that it?

600
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,590
- Who are you?
- Drop it.

601
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,639
No, wait!
Who do you think you are?

602
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:32,059
You're 40
and still wearing sweatshirts?

603
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:33,010
Yeah.

604
00:45:33,190 --> 00:45:34,679
Who do you think you are?

605
00:45:35,480 --> 00:45:37,849
No, no, no! Shut up, OK?

606
00:45:38,360 --> 00:45:40,440
He's tired, you know.
Drop it.

607
00:45:40,610 --> 00:45:41,639
- Tired?
- Yeah.

608
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:44,530
I'm not tired, are you?
No, you're not.

609
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:46,980
So, shut up!

610
00:45:49,199 --> 00:45:51,739
Get up.
Yeah get up, now!

611
00:45:55,340 --> 00:45:57,579
- Got a smoke?
- I don't smoke.

612
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,670
Does anyone have a smoke?

613
00:46:26,159 --> 00:46:28,530
- So?
- It's ringing, but no answer.

614
00:46:29,039 --> 00:46:30,610
- No one?
- Nope.

615
00:46:31,409 --> 00:46:32,789
Forget it, then.

616
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:36,869
Go get me a screamo-phone,
like they use in movies.

617
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:39,119
To shout at the public.

618
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,420
The day had started out fine!

619
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:45,460
But now, I'm exhausted, I'm fed up.
I got scared!

620
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:47,889
- Sir, let's stop...
- Do I know you?

621
00:46:48,059 --> 00:46:49,050
I'm Commissioner Bruges.

622
00:46:49,219 --> 00:46:51,929
Sir, I'm freaking out!

623
00:46:52,179 --> 00:46:53,809
There's been a hold-up

624
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:55,769
across the street...

625
00:46:55,940 --> 00:46:57,429
But look at my cab!

626
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:01,889
That's what I'm saying,
let's proceed 'step by step'.

627
00:47:02,070 --> 00:47:03,179
Look at my cab!

628
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,360
A few questions, first.

629
00:47:04,570 --> 00:47:07,280
I picked him up at
the airport.

630
00:47:07,949 --> 00:47:10,570
Did he have any
luggage, ma'am?

631
00:47:11,750 --> 00:47:12,690
Man, I can't.

632
00:47:12,869 --> 00:47:15,110
Please! Only once!

633
00:47:15,619 --> 00:47:16,570
I don't want to.

634
00:47:18,210 --> 00:47:19,210
Open your mouth.

635
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,000
Be cool, just once!

636
00:47:23,170 --> 00:47:24,500
I'm exhausted.

637
00:47:24,679 --> 00:47:27,550
Do me a favor!
I might never see you again.

638
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:31,500
Show me the move,
just once, please! Go ahead!

639
00:47:32,139 --> 00:47:33,800
Please, Jean-Claude!

640
00:47:49,239 --> 00:47:50,489
Let's all applaud!

641
00:47:56,289 --> 00:47:57,619
Nice, Jean-Claude!

642
00:47:58,380 --> 00:48:01,250
Told you he was the best!
Where are you going?

643
00:48:01,460 --> 00:48:03,750
Who told you to move?
Get back there.

644
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:04,920
Faster!

645
00:48:06,969 --> 00:48:08,380
Where's my ciggy?

646
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:14,179
Open your mouth!

647
00:48:28,780 --> 00:48:30,159
Move back a bit.

648
00:48:30,619 --> 00:48:31,780
A bit lower.

649
00:48:36,710 --> 00:48:37,739
- Jean-Claude?
- Yeah?

650
00:48:37,909 --> 00:48:39,539
- It's been years...
- So, don't do it.

651
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:41,619
Just once!

652
00:48:51,889 --> 00:48:55,389
He shows up and says "Go!".
So off I went with him.

653
00:48:55,559 --> 00:48:56,389
He said that?

654
00:48:56,559 --> 00:48:58,300
Yes, sir.

655
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,150
I did what he told me to,
he's a big star!

656
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,690
- What's this?
- I just fell!

657
00:49:08,860 --> 00:49:10,190
And what are you doing?

658
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:12,019
Come here now!

659
00:49:13,949 --> 00:49:15,940
- He needs a doc.
- Are you a nurse?

660
00:49:16,619 --> 00:49:18,199
Mr Van Damme!

661
00:49:18,869 --> 00:49:19,949
This is...

662
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:23,079
Commissioner Bruges,
pick up the phone

663
00:49:23,250 --> 00:49:24,579
so we can talk.

664
00:49:25,250 --> 00:49:26,329
Is this a joke?

665
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:28,539
No, Jean-Claude.

666
00:49:29,260 --> 00:49:31,170
They saw you with
the cabinet.

667
00:49:31,639 --> 00:49:34,639
- Moving a cabinet is robbing a bank?
- Shut up!

668
00:49:34,809 --> 00:49:38,219
If you need anything,
pick up the phone.

669
00:49:39,849 --> 00:49:41,969
I'm your contact.

670
00:49:43,059 --> 00:49:44,389
Bruges.

671
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:49,440
Here's our ticket out!

672
00:49:50,949 --> 00:49:52,519
I have enough problems...

673
00:49:52,699 --> 00:49:54,320
I said, shut up!

674
00:49:57,789 --> 00:49:58,699
Go ahead, big shot!

675
00:50:08,800 --> 00:50:10,869
Are we having fun, here?

676
00:50:14,139 --> 00:50:15,000
Can't believe it!

677
00:50:26,059 --> 00:50:27,809
- You read English?
- Yes.

678
00:50:39,329 --> 00:50:42,489
If you tell them,
you'll have blood on your hands.

679
00:50:44,329 --> 00:50:46,539
- What do I say?
- Let them talk.

680
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:49,500
What's "custody"?

681
00:50:49,670 --> 00:50:51,550
He picked up!

682
00:50:56,469 --> 00:50:57,420
Mr Van Damme.

683
00:51:00,309 --> 00:51:02,380
Bruges. How's it
going inside?

684
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,769
It could be better.

685
00:51:09,019 --> 00:51:11,889
OK, let me ask you first,
is anyone injured?

686
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:19,079
A man's unconscious
and bleeding.

687
00:51:20,409 --> 00:51:22,530
OK, good.
May I call you Jean-Claude?

688
00:51:23,619 --> 00:51:24,869
I'm Commissioner Bruges.

689
00:51:25,670 --> 00:51:27,239
You can call me Christian.

690
00:51:28,630 --> 00:51:30,920
You must release
the wounded man.

691
00:51:31,130 --> 00:51:34,550
Neither one of us
wants to have blood on our hands.

692
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:35,619
Of course.

693
00:51:35,969 --> 00:51:37,630
Will you release him?

694
00:51:40,099 --> 00:51:42,929
No, no one leaves.
It's impossible.

695
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:52,190
What if I came with a doctor?

696
00:51:56,150 --> 00:52:00,019
Hey, if there's a murder,
it's no longer a robbery.

697
00:52:04,909 --> 00:52:07,320
- And if I come with a doc?
- Alright, but unarmed.

698
00:52:08,130 --> 00:52:09,409
I give you my word.

699
00:52:09,630 --> 00:52:10,460
Bruges...

700
00:52:13,460 --> 00:52:16,219
- Whoever walks in is dead.
- If a man dies, we're screwed.

701
00:52:16,380 --> 00:52:17,300
Heard me earlier?

702
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:21,170
Well, they could come naked.

703
00:52:22,260 --> 00:52:25,800
In hostage movies, the bad guys
ask the good guys to come in

704
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:28,269
naked, so they know
they're clean.

705
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:30,559
How about naked?

706
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:38,019
Fine, tell them.

707
00:53:03,510 --> 00:53:04,380
Where's Petrucciani?

708
00:53:06,980 --> 00:53:08,429
3. Stone falls on Egg,

709
00:53:08,599 --> 00:53:11,349
Egg breaks.

710
00:53:34,090 --> 00:53:36,869
Hey, Jean-Claude, excuse me!
Didn't recognize you!

711
00:53:41,969 --> 00:53:43,130
Speak.

712
00:53:43,429 --> 00:53:44,460
Hey, Jeff. How are you?

713
00:53:45,099 --> 00:53:46,559
Hey, dawg!
What's up, dawg?

714
00:53:47,519 --> 00:53:49,559
Good, good, good...
Not so good.

715
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,099
I need some money.

716
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,880
Listen,
can you advance, er...

717
00:53:52,889 --> 00:53:55,050
Can the producers
advance me some money?

718
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:58,519
Listen, Jean-Claude,
I was gonna call you...

719
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:00,280
...right after your
vacation was over.

720
00:54:00,449 --> 00:54:02,570
They took
somebody else.

721
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:03,820
Who?

722
00:54:04,239 --> 00:54:05,320
Steven.

723
00:54:05,489 --> 00:54:07,030
Steven?

724
00:54:07,659 --> 00:54:10,230
He promised to cut off
his ponytail.

725
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:12,239
I know it hurts,

726
00:54:12,460 --> 00:54:13,539
I know it.

727
00:54:14,039 --> 00:54:16,829
Ok, ok, can you... Can I borrow
some money from you?

728
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:20,670
Hello!
You're breaking up...

729
00:54:23,139 --> 00:54:25,460
Hey, man! You're breaking
up here, I'm losing you.

730
00:54:26,219 --> 00:54:28,179
You must be in a
tunnel or something!

731
00:54:28,429 --> 00:54:30,550
Cut the bullshit!
Come on the phone!

732
00:54:31,829 --> 00:54:33,320
All right.
Yeah, yeah.

733
00:54:33,980 --> 00:54:35,059
What's next?

734
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:38,349
No Limit Injury.
It's about a Viet vet...

735
00:54:38,530 --> 00:54:39,940
We've done this
movie 6 months ago.

736
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:41,570
We did?

737
00:54:41,739 --> 00:54:42,650
What's next?

738
00:54:42,860 --> 00:54:47,110
No Limit Injury 2!
It's about a Gulf War vet

739
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,650
who fights to pay
for his son's education.

740
00:54:52,159 --> 00:54:54,409
- Is it good?
- I don't know.

741
00:54:55,460 --> 00:54:57,539
- Did you read it?
- I don't know.

742
00:55:03,630 --> 00:55:08,429
Call the producers... and...
tell them I need some money up front.

743
00:55:08,889 --> 00:55:12,159
- Hey, man, I can't do that!
- Just fucking do it, Jeff!

744
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:19,400
Aren't you Van Damme?

745
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,190
You're Jean-Claude Van Damme,
my idol!

746
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:24,309
Listen...

747
00:55:26,449 --> 00:55:28,570
I'm really tired and I...

748
00:55:29,030 --> 00:55:32,070
Don't start acting
like a big shot,

749
00:55:32,949 --> 00:55:35,159
Mr Hero of the century!

750
00:55:35,329 --> 00:55:39,579
I can finally talk to you
and listen to that tone!

751
00:55:39,750 --> 00:55:43,250
Let me talk to you.
You can rest, but let me talk.

752
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:46,130
Close your eyes,
but let me talk to you.

753
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:49,719
Anyway, when I see
you on screen,

754
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:52,639
well, you're really
different!

755
00:55:52,809 --> 00:55:53,510
Really?

756
00:55:53,679 --> 00:55:56,440
I think you look much better
on screen.

757
00:55:56,599 --> 00:55:58,980
And you're much nicer too,

758
00:55:59,150 --> 00:56:01,019
I can tell you that...

759
00:56:01,190 --> 00:56:03,679
- No, it's just that...
- Even if you're tired.

760
00:56:04,780 --> 00:56:06,980
I like you better on screen.

761
00:56:07,159 --> 00:56:09,780
- You hurt my feelings.
- Oh, c'mon...

762
00:56:09,949 --> 00:56:13,369
I always thought
you'd be nicer.

763
00:56:13,539 --> 00:56:17,750
Everyone worships you
here in Belgium, you're our star!

764
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:20,409
You represent us
in Hollywood.

765
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:23,119
Get used to having a driver
who talks!

766
00:56:23,300 --> 00:56:23,909
OK.

767
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:25,420
- Please!
- Sorry.

768
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,500
Yes, sorry! Yes!

769
00:56:27,969 --> 00:56:29,000
What's that?

770
00:56:30,349 --> 00:56:32,500
You don't need to show off!

771
00:56:33,389 --> 00:56:36,809
- You're doing it on purpose or what?
- No, I'm not.

772
00:56:39,019 --> 00:56:40,219
But you're nice.

773
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:43,010
You too, but even
more on screen!

774
00:56:43,320 --> 00:56:44,429
It's hot in here!

775
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,440
- Should I open?
- No, I'm tired.

776
00:56:46,610 --> 00:56:48,980
Then sleep, but let me talk.

777
00:56:49,159 --> 00:56:51,150
All cab drivers in
Brussels talk!

778
00:56:51,659 --> 00:56:55,280
You better get used to it
if you come here often.

779
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:58,619
No, seriously!

780
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:02,210
Star, star, star.
What are we talking about?

781
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:06,539
I surely didn't expect
this kind of attitude!

782
00:57:06,719 --> 00:57:10,130
Ma'am, I didn't mean to...
Sorry.

783
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:14,599
Well you hurt me anyway,
you don't realize, you're my idol!

784
00:57:14,769 --> 00:57:15,460
I'm sorry.

785
00:57:15,639 --> 00:57:17,969
I saw all your films.

786
00:57:18,139 --> 00:57:21,590
How can you be so rude?

787
00:57:21,769 --> 00:57:23,809
I'm sorry, I'm tired...

788
00:57:24,730 --> 00:57:27,730
- I still want a picture with you!
- I promise.

789
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,280
- Promise?
- Yes, ma'am.

790
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:31,320
- And you'll sign it?
- Yes, ma'am.

791
00:57:31,489 --> 00:57:33,150
- It's for my son!
- Yes, ma'am.

792
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:35,909
Jean-Claude!

793
00:58:01,849 --> 00:58:05,639
It's been over an hour and a half now
since Van Damme

794
00:58:05,820 --> 00:58:08,900
has taken refuge in the Schaerbeek
downtown post office.

795
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:12,860
She looks better on TV.

796
00:58:14,239 --> 00:58:16,699
We can't really say
what happened.

797
00:58:16,869 --> 00:58:19,739
After using a gun
several times,

798
00:58:19,909 --> 00:58:21,570
an anonymous source says...

799
00:58:21,750 --> 00:58:24,039
So tell the source
to stay anonymous!

800
00:58:25,710 --> 00:58:28,670
If anyone blabs,
you'll hear from me!

801
00:58:29,420 --> 00:58:30,670
Yes, chief.

802
00:58:32,429 --> 00:58:34,880
Thank you, chief.
Call him back.

803
00:58:38,059 --> 00:58:41,260
No, he was here
and there were three people there.

804
00:58:41,980 --> 00:58:45,389
OK, the Prefect authorized
the transfer. It's an order.

805
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:46,679
And the ransom?

806
00:58:47,019 --> 00:58:49,349
- That'll have to calm him down.
- I've seen worse.

807
00:58:49,530 --> 00:58:52,730
There's no attack.
With a kid inside, I'm not budging.

808
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:57,190
He picked up!

809
00:59:01,250 --> 00:59:01,949
Good news!

810
00:59:02,369 --> 00:59:05,079
- The transfer's authorized.
- Did it go through?

811
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,199
It will

812
00:59:06,420 --> 00:59:09,539
if you cooperate...
Sorry, but it's a 2-way street.

813
00:59:11,719 --> 00:59:12,500
And the money?

814
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:15,590
Same thing, it'll
take a bit longer.

815
00:59:15,889 --> 00:59:18,670
You're gonna have
to cooperate.

816
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:20,050
It's...

817
00:59:20,219 --> 00:59:21,389
What do you want?

818
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:23,389
The kid. Let him go.

819
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:29,730
I'll call you back.

820
00:59:31,230 --> 00:59:35,699
The crowd's agitated.
Something's going on over there.

821
00:59:35,860 --> 00:59:36,809
What's the commotion?

822
00:59:36,989 --> 00:59:40,239
Let's go.
Despite all this confusion,

823
00:59:40,489 --> 00:59:42,150
a car is trying to
get through.

824
00:59:44,409 --> 00:59:45,329
- Who is it?
- What?

825
00:59:45,500 --> 00:59:46,869
- Who is it?
- The Van Varenbergs.

826
00:59:47,039 --> 00:59:48,619
- Who?
- Van Damme's parents.

827
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:50,289
Why don't you escort them?

828
00:59:54,260 --> 00:59:56,050
Please! Please!

829
00:59:58,219 --> 00:59:59,960
Mrs Van Damme!
Your son...

830
01:00:01,219 --> 01:00:02,969
My son's a good man!

831
01:00:03,139 --> 01:00:04,139
No comment!

832
01:00:04,429 --> 01:00:07,969
What do you think you're doing?
Trying to screw me?

833
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:11,150
- You're nuts or what?
- Say you wanna screw me.

834
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:13,309
- I'm not saying that.
- The kid stays.

835
01:00:13,739 --> 01:00:16,610
- They gave in.
- Shut up. It's our only vest.

836
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:18,190
He's right. They gave in.

837
01:00:18,369 --> 01:00:20,400
Hey, who's doing the hold-up?

838
01:00:20,579 --> 01:00:23,030
They gave in to him.
No hostage is leaving.

839
01:00:23,199 --> 01:00:25,110
Get back, I told you!

840
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:27,329
For the second
time, don't move!

841
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:28,659
- Watch your tone.
- I do as I please.

842
01:00:28,829 --> 01:00:30,869
- Get on back!
- Shut up, you heard me.

843
01:00:31,800 --> 01:00:33,340
- Lower your gun.
- Calm down!

844
01:00:33,510 --> 01:00:35,130
You lower yours first.

845
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:37,670
- Go on back.
- Shut up and lower your gun.

846
01:00:37,969 --> 01:00:39,510
- Go on back.
- I'm going now.

847
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:41,590
They'll break negotiations.

848
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,510
And I'll break your neck.

849
01:00:47,389 --> 01:00:50,019
If it's not the kid,
let a hostage go.

850
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:52,230
Just don't shoot, man.

851
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:54,679
Don't shoot.

852
01:00:55,690 --> 01:00:56,889
Stop it.

853
01:00:57,449 --> 01:00:58,480
He's right.

854
01:01:00,739 --> 01:01:02,610
If we let one go,
he's gonna talk.

855
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:05,320
Not the one I'm thinking of.

856
01:01:47,659 --> 01:01:49,070
Tell them we'll release one.

857
01:01:49,250 --> 01:01:51,869
- Your maniac son hurt someone.
- Maniac?

858
01:01:54,170 --> 01:01:55,710
He's Jean-Claude.

859
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,590
He's Camille.

860
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,329
He's François.

861
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,920
He's Van Damme or
Van Varenberg!

862
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:04,420
But he's not a maniac!

863
01:02:09,309 --> 01:02:10,219
Get outta here.

864
01:02:14,110 --> 01:02:15,650
He's on the line, boss.

865
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:20,309
Gotta do something
for the kid.

866
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:25,739
Help me convince your son
to let him go.

867
01:02:33,960 --> 01:02:36,329
OK for a hostage,
but not the kid.

868
01:02:39,050 --> 01:02:40,510
Someone wants to talk to you.

869
01:02:46,929 --> 01:02:48,010
Honey?

870
01:02:49,639 --> 01:02:50,760
Mom?

871
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:56,059
What are you doing, son?

872
01:02:56,980 --> 01:02:58,309
Nothing.

873
01:02:58,940 --> 01:02:59,860
Nothing!

874
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,400
Please talk to me, dear.

875
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:04,809
Nothing, mom.

876
01:03:06,829 --> 01:03:07,659
Mom, give me the...

877
01:03:07,869 --> 01:03:09,150
son of a bitch!

878
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:12,539
Get my lawyer on the phone.

879
01:03:13,369 --> 01:03:17,039
Tell them I'm releasing a hostage.
Don't cry, Mom.

880
01:03:21,590 --> 01:03:22,920
Hurry up!

881
01:03:27,760 --> 01:03:29,010
Take them away.

882
01:03:38,900 --> 01:03:40,059
It was my mother.

883
01:03:41,230 --> 01:03:43,110
I don't give a shit
about your mother.

884
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:46,559
Wanna hear about mine?

885
01:03:46,949 --> 01:03:49,190
- Last time I saw her...
- What?

886
01:03:49,789 --> 01:03:51,110
...was when I was born.

887
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:56,360
He tries to screw me,
then he makes me cry.

888
01:03:56,710 --> 01:03:59,030
You come with me.

889
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:02,170
- Why?
- 'Cause you're getting out.

890
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:04,960
So, let's go.

891
01:04:05,130 --> 01:04:06,929
No, he stays here.

892
01:04:07,090 --> 01:04:07,920
C'mon, mister.

893
01:04:08,139 --> 01:04:11,170
Make the transfer
and get me his lawyer.

894
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:16,849
Rule number 1.

895
01:04:17,480 --> 01:04:19,800
It's the maniac
that shows good faith.

896
01:04:21,610 --> 01:04:22,889
C'mon.

897
01:04:25,949 --> 01:04:26,980
C'mon.

898
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:34,860
- Why do I have to go?
- Shut up. Come with me.

899
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:36,869
Why do you want to keep him?

900
01:04:37,170 --> 01:04:40,449
- He stays here. You come with me.
- Let him go.

901
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:42,500
Not without me.

902
01:04:42,840 --> 01:04:45,670
Not without my son!

903
01:04:59,019 --> 01:04:59,969
Hello?

904
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:02,469
Wait.
The lawyer's on the line.

905
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,449
Hi, Sir.

906
01:05:08,699 --> 01:05:10,650
Mister...

907
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:12,860
One moment...

908
01:05:13,949 --> 01:05:15,150
Mr. Bernstein,

909
01:05:16,329 --> 01:05:19,000
We need you to talk the voice
of reason to your client.

910
01:05:19,170 --> 01:05:20,119
Get him on the phone!

911
01:05:20,289 --> 01:05:21,670
Stand up, up you go!

912
01:05:23,630 --> 01:05:24,869
Let me go!

913
01:05:27,380 --> 01:05:29,420
- You sure are lucky.
- So are you.

914
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:31,800
- With your gun.
- You too sure are lucky.

915
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,420
You're really lucky.

916
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:43,139
Let me go!

917
01:05:47,239 --> 01:05:50,190
Damien, I'll be back.
Mommy's coming back!

918
01:05:53,869 --> 01:05:54,900
Move.

919
01:06:01,789 --> 01:06:03,579
Move. Get up.

920
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,909
When I say get up,
you get up!

921
01:06:07,300 --> 01:06:08,460
One word
and you're dead.

922
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,340
Hello?

923
01:06:10,550 --> 01:06:12,789
Jean-Claude, what the hell
is wrong with you?

924
01:06:13,179 --> 01:06:14,510
Did you get the money?

925
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,340
Yes, of course, but...
What the fuck...

926
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:19,260
Okay then, do your job!

927
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:25,889
If you open your mouth,
you're gonna find your kid in pieces.

928
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:28,469
I'll take care of him.

929
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:34,150
What? You can't even take care
of your own kid!

930
01:06:34,320 --> 01:06:35,610
It's all your fault!

931
01:06:35,829 --> 01:06:37,199
They're raising the curtain!

932
01:07:14,030 --> 01:07:15,610
Stand back.

933
01:07:16,869 --> 01:07:19,989
Please, ma'am.
I said stand back.

934
01:07:38,599 --> 01:07:39,840
Over there.

935
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:43,599
Over there, I said.

936
01:07:47,769 --> 01:07:49,429
OK, so we put it
all in boxes.

937
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:52,230
I'm gonna keep
a Christmas decoration.

938
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:53,570
I like this one.

939
01:07:53,739 --> 01:07:55,280
It's a little beauty.

940
01:07:55,449 --> 01:07:59,989
This way, we'll remember
it's almost Mardi Gras.

941
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:04,320
Our minds crossed.
I took a heart from my tree.

942
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:09,460
Yeah, and St. Valentine's Day
is coming up. Hurray for love.

943
01:08:09,670 --> 01:08:10,619
Dimitri's so romantic!

944
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:13,500
It's our 1,500th show today!

945
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:24,350
This movie is for me.

946
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:28,390
There we are, you and me.

947
01:08:36,569 --> 01:08:38,479
Why did you do that?

948
01:08:38,989 --> 01:08:41,560
Or why did I do that?

949
01:08:42,699 --> 01:08:44,529
You made my dream come true.

950
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:46,529
I asked you for it.

951
01:08:46,750 --> 01:08:50,750
I promised you something in return
and I haven't delivered yet.

952
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:55,960
You win, I lose.

953
01:08:58,390 --> 01:09:00,090
Unless...

954
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:04,050
the path you've set for me

955
01:09:04,220 --> 01:09:05,600
is full of hurdles

956
01:09:05,770 --> 01:09:10,010
where the answer
comes before the question.

957
01:09:10,189 --> 01:09:12,430
Yeah, I do that.

958
01:09:13,479 --> 01:09:15,939
Now I know why.

959
01:09:16,109 --> 01:09:20,060
It's the cure,
from what I've seen here.

960
01:09:20,619 --> 01:09:22,659
It all makes sense.

961
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:26,489
It makes sense
to those who understand.

962
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,869
So... America,

963
01:09:32,090 --> 01:09:33,960
poverty,

964
01:09:34,590 --> 01:09:37,000
stealing to eat...

965
01:09:37,510 --> 01:09:41,920
Stalking producers,
actors, 'movie stars',

966
01:09:42,390 --> 01:09:45,720
going to clubs
hoping to see a star,

967
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:49,090
with my pictures,
karate magazines.

968
01:09:49,270 --> 01:09:52,220
It's all I had.
I didn't speak English.

969
01:09:54,569 --> 01:09:57,270
But I did 20 years of karate.

970
01:09:57,439 --> 01:09:59,899
'Cause before I wasn't like that.

971
01:10:00,489 --> 01:10:02,699
This... This is me today.

972
01:10:02,869 --> 01:10:06,399
I used to be small
and scrawny.

973
01:10:06,579 --> 01:10:09,949
And I took up karate.
Hence the Dojo, hence respect,

974
01:10:10,119 --> 01:10:13,539
thou shall believe
people who say,

975
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:15,369
"Oss!"

976
01:10:16,590 --> 01:10:18,050
It's Samurai code.

977
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:20,340
It's honor, no lies.

978
01:10:20,510 --> 01:10:22,670
So this guy in the US,

979
01:10:23,050 --> 01:10:24,880
it's not the same thing.

980
01:10:25,220 --> 01:10:27,430
No one says "Oss" to you.

981
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:31,300
Sometimes people
in show business say,

982
01:10:35,069 --> 01:10:38,399
I believed in
people, in the Dojo.

983
01:10:38,569 --> 01:10:42,779
I was blessed
and had a lot of 'wives'.

984
01:10:43,069 --> 01:10:45,279
I always believed in love.

985
01:10:45,579 --> 01:10:49,529
It's hard for a woman
with three kids to say,

986
01:10:49,710 --> 01:10:51,739
"Which one do I love more?"

987
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,579
A mother...

988
01:10:54,130 --> 01:10:57,659
If you have 5, 6, 7
or 10 wives in a lifetime,

989
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:00,960
they've all got
something special,

990
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:03,010
but no one cares about that

991
01:11:03,180 --> 01:11:06,460
in the so-called media.

992
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:10,470
What about drugs?

993
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:14,100
When you got it all,
you travel the world.

994
01:11:14,859 --> 01:11:16,479
When you've been in
all the hotels,

995
01:11:16,649 --> 01:11:21,390
you're the prima donna
of the penthouse.

996
01:11:21,859 --> 01:11:25,529
And in all hotels the world over,
traveling,

997
01:11:25,699 --> 01:11:29,229
you want something more.

998
01:11:29,409 --> 01:11:31,399
And because of a woman...

999
01:11:31,579 --> 01:11:33,869
Well, because of love,

1000
01:11:34,039 --> 01:11:37,210
I tried something
and I got hooked.

1001
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:41,829
Van Damme, the beast,

1002
01:11:42,090 --> 01:11:43,920
the tiger in a cage,

1003
01:11:44,090 --> 01:11:47,630
the "Bloodsport"
man got hooked.

1004
01:11:47,970 --> 01:11:51,890
I was wasted mentally
and physically.

1005
01:11:52,479 --> 01:11:56,010
To the point that
I got out of it.

1006
01:12:00,279 --> 01:12:02,069
I got out of it.

1007
01:12:03,399 --> 01:12:04,520
But...

1008
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:07,239
It's all there.

1009
01:12:08,829 --> 01:12:10,649
It's all there.

1010
01:12:12,789 --> 01:12:14,779
It was really tough.

1011
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:20,170
I saw people worse
off than me.

1012
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:24,710
I went from poor to rich and thought,
why aren't we all like me.

1013
01:12:25,180 --> 01:12:26,970
Why all the privileges?

1014
01:12:27,140 --> 01:12:29,050
I'm just a regular guy.

1015
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:31,590
It makes me sick to
see people...

1016
01:12:32,810 --> 01:12:34,720
who don't have what I've got.

1017
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:36,800
Knowing that

1018
01:12:36,979 --> 01:12:40,390
they have qualities, too.

1019
01:12:40,569 --> 01:12:43,479
Much more than I do!

1020
01:12:43,649 --> 01:12:46,439
It's not my fault
if I was cut out to be a star.

1021
01:12:46,609 --> 01:12:48,439
I asked for it.

1022
01:12:48,619 --> 01:12:50,569
I asked for it,
really believed in it.

1023
01:12:50,739 --> 01:12:53,449
When you're 13,
you believe in your dream.

1024
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:55,250
Well, it came true for me.

1025
01:12:55,409 --> 01:12:57,869
But I still ask myself today

1026
01:12:58,670 --> 01:13:00,909
what I've done on this earth.

1027
01:13:01,710 --> 01:13:02,989
Nothing!

1028
01:13:03,630 --> 01:13:05,170
I've done nothing!

1029
01:13:07,970 --> 01:13:11,340
And I might just die
in this post office,

1030
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:17,010
hoping to start all over
here in Belgium,

1031
01:13:17,439 --> 01:13:20,390
in my country,
where my roots are.

1032
01:13:21,270 --> 01:13:24,970
Start all over with my parents
and get my health back,

1033
01:13:26,359 --> 01:13:28,979
pick up again.
So I really hope...

1034
01:13:29,659 --> 01:13:33,899
nobody's gonna pull a trigger
in this post office...

1035
01:13:35,039 --> 01:13:38,789
It's so stupid to kill people.
They're so beautiful!

1036
01:13:40,039 --> 01:13:43,079
So, today, I pray to God.

1037
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:46,800
I truly believe

1038
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:49,380
it's not a movie.

1039
01:13:49,680 --> 01:13:51,500
It's real life.

1040
01:13:53,760 --> 01:13:55,340
Real life.

1041
01:14:00,479 --> 01:14:02,390
I've seen so many things.

1042
01:14:04,109 --> 01:14:05,930
I was born in Belgium,

1043
01:14:06,279 --> 01:14:08,680
but I'm citizen of the world.

1044
01:14:08,859 --> 01:14:10,939
I've travelled a lot.

1045
01:14:11,619 --> 01:14:14,619
It's hard for me to
judge people

1046
01:14:15,119 --> 01:14:17,439
and it's hard for them...

1047
01:14:20,369 --> 01:14:22,529
not to judge me.

1048
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:25,079
Easier to blame me.

1049
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:29,670
Yeah, something like that.

1050
01:14:41,979 --> 01:14:43,060
Dimitri's so romantic!

1051
01:14:43,229 --> 01:14:45,310
It's our 1,500th show today!

1052
01:14:45,479 --> 01:14:48,189
And I'm giving out rare items

1053
01:14:48,359 --> 01:14:51,729
like the red wig
"Véronique et Sébastien" never wore.

1054
01:14:51,909 --> 01:14:53,149
We don't know why!

1055
01:14:53,319 --> 01:14:56,739
It's the hat full of ideas
for reportages.

1056
01:14:58,369 --> 01:15:00,579
Say, Arthur?

1057
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:04,319
- That's your name, right?
- Yeah.

1058
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:09,590
We've gotta free
the hostages.

1059
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,420
I can't do that, Jean-Claude.

1060
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:15,210
Yes, you can. It's easy.

1061
01:15:16,510 --> 01:15:18,060
We just go there,

1062
01:15:18,220 --> 01:15:20,300
raise the curtain

1063
01:15:20,890 --> 01:15:22,170
and split!

1064
01:15:24,350 --> 01:15:26,810
4. Egg falls on Stone,

1065
01:15:26,979 --> 01:15:29,109
Egg breaks.

1066
01:15:29,279 --> 01:15:31,569
7 hostages left!
How are we gonna hold out?

1067
01:15:31,739 --> 01:15:35,239
- It's OK. We need time.
- Wait for what? What's the plan?

1068
01:15:35,409 --> 01:15:37,359
The cops question her,
then what?

1069
01:15:37,529 --> 01:15:39,689
- They count the dough.
- After that...

1070
01:15:39,869 --> 01:15:41,909
Hey, what dough?

1071
01:15:42,119 --> 01:15:44,909
You're waiting for them
to count the million?

1072
01:15:45,079 --> 01:15:48,619
You crazy? What's a million?
I won't calm down.

1073
01:15:48,800 --> 01:15:51,579
How are you gonna get out?
She'll blab.

1074
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:52,960
No, we've got the kid.

1075
01:15:53,130 --> 01:15:55,539
I tell you,
the first one to leave dies.

1076
01:15:55,720 --> 01:15:56,960
You can't kill anyone.

1077
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:59,380
I'll kill whoever I like.
No more talking!

1078
01:15:59,560 --> 01:16:02,760
The next one out is dead.
A hostage, whatever!

1079
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:05,090
Whoever you want, you got it?

1080
01:16:05,270 --> 01:16:08,470
We'll obtain more that way
and have the upper hand.

1081
01:16:10,109 --> 01:16:10,970
What are you doing?

1082
01:16:11,989 --> 01:16:14,310
What?
You want to hold it for me?

1083
01:16:14,989 --> 01:16:16,399
Let's wait for the bus...

1084
01:16:16,569 --> 01:16:19,409
What the bus?
We're gonna go home by bus?

1085
01:16:19,579 --> 01:16:22,659
Why not on the subway!

1086
01:16:24,289 --> 01:16:27,119
Hey, it's the
second round or what?

1087
01:16:28,210 --> 01:16:29,210
I'm pissing.

1088
01:16:29,380 --> 01:16:30,659
- Pissing?
- Yeah!

1089
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:32,579
You piss silently?

1090
01:16:32,760 --> 01:16:33,949
Yeah, don't you?

1091
01:16:34,130 --> 01:16:35,539
- You piss white?
- Yeah!

1092
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:38,340
You piss invisible!
Think I'm an idiot?

1093
01:16:38,510 --> 01:16:40,010
Why? Are you sick?

1094
01:16:40,390 --> 01:16:42,630
Do you piss yellow? Red?

1095
01:16:42,810 --> 01:16:44,680
At least, there's color.

1096
01:16:44,850 --> 01:16:46,350
- You're sick.
- So, I'm sick?

1097
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:47,899
- I'm sick?
- Yeah.

1098
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:53,479
Wait, I'm going
back to my spot...

1099
01:16:55,819 --> 01:16:57,729
Where the fuck are they?

1100
01:17:09,380 --> 01:17:12,289
Back in the room, faster!

1101
01:17:21,640 --> 01:17:24,720
Let her through, she's the mother!
It's her son!

1102
01:17:36,699 --> 01:17:37,399
Move back.

1103
01:17:41,739 --> 01:17:43,239
What do you want?

1104
01:17:43,409 --> 01:17:45,949
You wanna screw me
over again?

1105
01:17:46,289 --> 01:17:48,029
I was just trying to help...

1106
01:17:48,460 --> 01:17:49,739
Move back!

1107
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,960
I said, move back!

1108
01:17:53,130 --> 01:17:56,130
- Don't shoot.
- Move back, move back.

1109
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:58,039
Don't fucking shoot!

1110
01:18:01,090 --> 01:18:04,050
- What are you doing?
- You're gonna shoot me?

1111
01:18:04,220 --> 01:18:06,180
What I'm doing?
What about you?

1112
01:18:06,520 --> 01:18:08,590
Whose side are you on?

1113
01:18:08,770 --> 01:18:10,390
- Who are you with?
- Shut up!

1114
01:18:13,729 --> 01:18:14,560
Let him go!

1115
01:18:21,529 --> 01:18:24,869
We want information!

1116
01:18:25,079 --> 01:18:27,279
I said, get the
fuck outta here!

1117
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:29,199
You, motherfucker!

1118
01:18:29,369 --> 01:18:30,069
Let go.

1119
01:18:34,960 --> 01:18:35,960
Sir!

1120
01:18:36,130 --> 01:18:38,619
My son, Jean-Claude...

1121
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:41,920
- What's going on?
- Is Jean-Claude dead or...

1122
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:45,680
Answer me, damn it!
He's my son!

1123
01:18:45,850 --> 01:18:48,550
Make her stop crying!

1124
01:18:49,350 --> 01:18:51,560
I said, let go!

1125
01:19:00,319 --> 01:19:01,899
What?

1126
01:19:02,239 --> 01:19:03,949
Go ahead, shoot!

1127
01:19:04,909 --> 01:19:07,069
You too, get lost!

1128
01:19:10,119 --> 01:19:13,739
<i>Back to our correspondent
in Los Angeles</i>

1129
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:18,750
<i>where it seems Van Damme's
attorney has a statement to make.</i>

1130
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:23,039
<i>We represented Mr. Van Damme
for over fifteen years,</i>

1131
01:19:23,220 --> 01:19:26,880
<i>which is a lot of time, a lot of
business, a lot of friendship, so...</i>

1132
01:19:27,060 --> 01:19:29,050
<i>It is with the
greatest regret that</i>

1133
01:19:29,050 --> 01:19:31,720
<i>I had to prepare the
statement with my colleagues</i>

1134
01:19:32,020 --> 01:19:34,850
"Because of Mr. Van Damme's behavior
and for ethical purposes,

1135
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,770
my firm and myself hereby,

1136
01:19:36,979 --> 01:19:39,850
immediately cease to represent
Jean Claude Van Damme."

1137
01:19:40,069 --> 01:19:41,560
Go, over there!

1138
01:19:42,449 --> 01:19:43,640
Bang!

1139
01:19:43,819 --> 01:19:44,649
Like in movies.

1140
01:19:58,170 --> 01:20:00,079
What the hell are you doing?

1141
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:04,420
Whose side are you on, you dork?
That moron soften you up?

1142
01:20:05,260 --> 01:20:07,380
Oh yeah, I'm the dork?

1143
01:20:07,550 --> 01:20:11,220
Yeah, a 32-year-old
who still watches karate films?

1144
01:20:11,390 --> 01:20:13,880
And who gets softened up
like a beginner!

1145
01:20:14,140 --> 01:20:14,970
- A beginner?
- Yeah!

1146
01:20:15,149 --> 01:20:19,689
Robbing a post office at my age,
that's a youth mistake! But at 52...

1147
01:20:19,859 --> 01:20:22,149
Yeah, right! 52 years old!

1148
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:25,270
You owe me some respect.
I could be your father!

1149
01:20:25,449 --> 01:20:27,439
My father?
Because of your age?

1150
01:20:27,619 --> 01:20:30,449
No, because I fucked
your mother!

1151
01:20:33,210 --> 01:20:33,869
Sure!

1152
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:48,920
Are you happy now?

1153
01:20:49,100 --> 01:20:50,800
Did you ever go to school?

1154
01:20:50,970 --> 01:20:54,090
You'd know that
stone falls on egg,

1155
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:56,350
breaks egg

1156
01:20:57,229 --> 01:20:59,930
and egg which...

1157
01:21:00,399 --> 01:21:03,680
an egg which falls...

1158
01:21:12,199 --> 01:21:14,199
Because we can't...

1159
01:21:14,789 --> 01:21:17,329
You can't save...

1160
01:21:18,130 --> 01:21:19,539
the world.

1161
01:21:31,510 --> 01:21:32,890
What?

1162
01:21:34,220 --> 01:21:36,130
We said, "Not the mothers!"

1163
01:21:43,899 --> 01:21:45,810
I don't wanna die.

1164
01:21:46,029 --> 01:21:48,069
I don't wanna die.

1165
01:21:51,199 --> 01:21:52,779
I don't wanna die.

1166
01:22:04,840 --> 01:22:06,829
It's over, it's over.

1167
01:22:13,810 --> 01:22:15,680
Don't worry, Jean-Claude.

1168
01:22:16,930 --> 01:22:19,800
Aren't we better
off without him?

1169
01:22:34,529 --> 01:22:37,899
- He shot him in the head.
- Put Jean-Claude on.

1170
01:22:58,390 --> 01:22:59,890
Jean-Claude?

1171
01:23:00,939 --> 01:23:02,560
I wanted to ask you...

1172
01:23:05,569 --> 01:23:08,569
Could you sign me
an autograph?

1173
01:23:11,819 --> 01:23:13,199
For Arthur.

1174
01:23:15,239 --> 01:23:16,819
Promise?

1175
01:23:19,579 --> 01:23:20,609
Thanks.

1176
01:23:41,979 --> 01:23:43,550
The cops.

1177
01:23:44,399 --> 01:23:45,479
- No!
- Yes...

1178
01:23:50,779 --> 01:23:52,060
Arthur?

1179
01:23:53,489 --> 01:23:54,600
Don't shoot!

1180
01:23:55,739 --> 01:23:56,859
Police!

1181
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:10,420
Police! Don't move!

1182
01:24:48,920 --> 01:24:51,130
I'm a hostage!

1183
01:24:55,220 --> 01:24:56,170
I'm a hostage!

1184
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:04,300
I need a doctor, now!

1185
01:25:04,479 --> 01:25:06,430
- Drop the gun!
- Get lost!

1186
01:25:08,729 --> 01:25:12,149
Get out or I'll smoke him!

1187
01:25:12,569 --> 01:25:14,939
- Drop the gun!
- Let him go.

1188
01:25:20,949 --> 01:25:23,659
Get outta here or
I'll smoke him!

1189
01:25:25,460 --> 01:25:26,909
It's not him!

1190
01:25:32,250 --> 01:25:33,829
It's not Jean-Claude!

1191
01:25:43,470 --> 01:25:45,930
- Get outta here!
- Drop the gun!

1192
01:25:46,229 --> 01:25:49,010
I'm gonna smoke him!
Get outta here!

1193
01:27:27,239 --> 01:27:28,739
I didn't do anything!

1194
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:44,010
What the hell is
going on here?

1195
01:27:45,930 --> 01:27:47,300
You're a criminal!

1196
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:50,720
Extortion of 465,000 dollars
from the Belgian State.

1197
01:27:50,890 --> 01:27:53,510
- Extortion?
- What extortion?

1198
01:27:53,689 --> 01:27:55,180
There's no extortion!

1199
01:27:55,859 --> 01:27:57,729
You're an asshole.

1200
01:28:54,869 --> 01:28:57,539
A few months later

1201
01:28:58,710 --> 01:29:03,619
During the trial,
Van Damme seemed quite serene

1202
01:29:03,800 --> 01:29:07,579
and wishes to remain silent...
Here he comes.

1203
01:29:08,260 --> 01:29:10,050
Mr Van Damme, a statement?

1204
01:29:10,220 --> 01:29:12,760
Do you agree
with the court's verdict?

1205
01:29:28,619 --> 01:29:30,159
<i>The results are in.</i>

1206
01:29:30,329 --> 01:29:33,909
<i>Jean-Claude Van Damme has been convicted
for 3 years. One year jail time,</i>

1207
01:29:34,119 --> 01:29:36,079
<i>two years probation...</i>

1208
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:40,869
<i>Jean-Claude Van Damme,
as mentioned earlier,</i>

1209
01:29:41,090 --> 01:29:44,340
<i>will serve 1 year
for extortion of funds.</i>

1210
01:29:44,510 --> 01:29:48,840
He should serve his sentence
in a prison in Brussels' suburbs.

1211
01:29:49,010 --> 01:29:53,300
And this ends
the thrilling judicial series.

1212
01:29:53,470 --> 01:29:57,220
<i>We just heard
of the incredible escape...</i>

1213
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:05,229
<i>If the knee is lower than the foot,
like this...</i>

1214
01:30:05,439 --> 01:30:08,899
<i>You won't have any strength.
Lower, which is bad...</i>

1215
01:30:08,949 --> 01:30:11,869
I'm gonna kick like this,
with no power. Check...

1216
01:30:12,369 --> 01:30:13,609
Knee too low...

1217
01:30:13,789 --> 01:30:16,949
If I put my knee high,
I can even kick higher. Go higher.

1218
01:30:16,949 --> 01:30:18,130
Then I go... Bam!

1219
01:30:18,130 --> 01:30:20,550
- It's something moving.
- Van Damme...

1220
01:30:20,750 --> 01:30:22,029
Harder!

1221
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:23,979
And what if somebody come at me
with a knife?

1222
01:30:24,020 --> 01:30:25,539
- Van Damme, visit...
- A knife?

1223
01:30:25,550 --> 01:30:27,369
Then I keep my distance,
and my knee high...

1224
01:30:27,550 --> 01:30:29,340
You have a knife,
I go inside you

1225
01:30:29,340 --> 01:30:31,329
or I can go above
you. Do you understand?

1226
01:30:31,430 --> 01:30:33,970
Van Damme!
Visiting room!

1227
01:30:34,470 --> 01:30:35,970
I'm coming.
I'm coming.

1228
01:30:37,560 --> 01:30:39,100
It's my mother.

1229
01:30:39,479 --> 01:30:41,100
See you, guys.
Thank you.

1230
01:30:57,909 --> 01:30:59,289
How are you, Mom?

1231
01:31:00,619 --> 01:31:01,739
Aren't you cold?

1232
01:31:01,920 --> 01:31:05,500
No, no. I just gave the
guys a karate lesson...

1233
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:08,210
- You teach karate?
- Yeah, keeps me busy.

1234
01:31:08,380 --> 01:31:09,460
That's nice.

1235
01:31:09,680 --> 01:31:12,710
Your father asked
how you were doing and

1236
01:31:12,890 --> 01:31:15,260
wanted to tell you stuff...

1237
01:31:15,430 --> 01:31:16,210
Is he OK?

1238
01:31:16,680 --> 01:31:19,430
I'll be right back.
I have a surprise.

1239
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,439
- Excuse me?
- I have a surprise for you.

1240
01:31:22,649 --> 01:31:25,399
- I've had plenty of surprises.
- Wait a sec.

1241
01:31:25,569 --> 01:31:27,060
We don't have much time.
