1
00:01:05,832 --> 00:01:07,424
Honey, you got the baby?

2
00:01:11,137 --> 00:01:12,536
Yeah, yeah, I got the...

3
00:01:12,605 --> 00:01:14,095
I'll get the baby.
I thought you had him.

4
00:01:24,617 --> 00:01:26,847
Coming. Coming.

5
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,852
Oh!

6
00:01:46,372 --> 00:01:49,439
Daddy's got you.

7
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,533
Where's my kiss?

8
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,669
Come on. Come on.

9
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,581
Come on. Come on.

10
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,451
You're doing it wrong.

11
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,646
What are you talking about?

12
00:02:01,721 --> 00:02:02,881
You don't even know
what I'm doing.

13
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,150
I can tell by the cry.

14
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,816
Come on, take Kelly.

15
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,660
Come on, take Kelly.
I got this.

16
00:02:14,734 --> 00:02:15,792
Go ahead.

17
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:18,702
Hey, my big boy... Hi.

18
00:02:29,549 --> 00:02:30,538
Aw...

19
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:33,347
That's my big boy.

20
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:34,647
Oh, yes...

21
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:36,382
<i>Hi, I'm Richard Cooper.</i>

22
00:02:36,456 --> 00:02:38,048
<i>And that's my wife Brenda.</i>

23
00:02:38,124 --> 00:02:41,787
<i>We have two incredible
children, Brian and Kelly.</i>

24
00:02:41,861 --> 00:02:44,352
<i>We've been married
close to seven years.</i>

25
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,194
<i>My wife is beautiful,
intelligent</i>

26
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:48,359
<i>and a great mother.</i>

27
00:02:48,434 --> 00:02:50,163
<i>It's the perfect life.</i>

28
00:02:50,236 --> 00:02:52,670
<i>There's just one problem:</i>

29
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,106
<i>I'm bored out of
my fucking mind.</i>

30
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:59,612
<i>Now, I'm sure I'd have
a much rosier outlook on life</i>

31
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,806
<i>if my wife and I
actually had sex,</i>

32
00:03:01,881 --> 00:03:04,008
<i>but there always
seems to be something wrong.</i>

33
00:03:04,083 --> 00:03:05,675
No, my face hurts.

34
00:03:05,752 --> 00:03:08,220
It's not your birthday.

35
00:03:14,794 --> 00:03:19,094
<i>We both work, we're both tired,
but that's no excuse.</i>

36
00:03:19,165 --> 00:03:21,224
<i>To be honest, I don't know</i>

37
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:23,098
<i>how much more of
this I can take.</i>

38
00:03:23,169 --> 00:03:26,002
Richard, do you think
perhaps you work too much?

39
00:03:26,072 --> 00:03:26,970
Oh, no, no, no.

40
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,405
I- I work, too. I do.

41
00:03:28,474 --> 00:03:30,669
But I come home from work, and
I have to take care of the kids,

42
00:03:30,743 --> 00:03:32,040
and I have to take care of you.

43
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:33,339
And frankly, I'm tired.

44
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:34,437
I'm tired.

45
00:03:34,514 --> 00:03:36,448
Too tired to wear
a nice pair of panties?

46
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:37,676
What's wrong with my panties?

47
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,876
They're huge!

48
00:03:38,952 --> 00:03:40,749
You know, the biggest thing
on a pair of panties

49
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,980
should be the tag.

50
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,784
That's all I want to see:
tag and ass.

51
00:03:43,856 --> 00:03:44,823
Tag and ass!

52
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,586
You see? You see?

53
00:03:46,659 --> 00:03:48,126
- This is what I'm talking about.
- Mm-hmm.

54
00:03:48,194 --> 00:03:49,593
You see how insensitive he is?

55
00:03:49,662 --> 00:03:51,186
You know, Brenda,
maybe I'd be more sensitive

56
00:03:51,264 --> 00:03:52,492
if you'd have sex with me.

57
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:53,930
It seems like the only time

58
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,900
she wants to have sex with me
is to make a baby.

59
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:57,800
The only time you want
to make a baby with me

60
00:03:57,870 --> 00:03:59,269
is to have sex.

61
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:00,806
That doesn't make any sense!

62
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:02,170
Well, that's because I'm tired!

63
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,709
Now we're making progress.

64
00:04:05,044 --> 00:04:07,569
<i>I hated that therapist.</i>

65
00:04:07,647 --> 00:04:10,377
<i>She wasn't married
and didn't have any kids.</i>

66
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,781
<i>You know,</i>

67
00:04:11,851 --> 00:04:14,649
<i>when you're on a plane,
you kind of want a pilot</i>

68
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:16,882
<i>with more experience
than you.</i>

69
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:18,617
<i>But maybe that's just me.</i>

70
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:22,218
<i>Now, what I can't figure out
is how can my wife</i>

71
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,230
<i>not have sex with me,
and then send me out</i>

72
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:28,495
<i>into a world with so many
beautiful women?</i>

73
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:30,229
<i>That's like dropping me
into the ocean</i>

74
00:04:30,303 --> 00:04:32,794
<i>and expecting me
to not get wet.</i>

75
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:35,397
<i>I mean, every single woman
that I see</i>

76
00:04:35,475 --> 00:04:37,875
<i>I have an imaginary
relationship with.</i>

77
00:04:37,944 --> 00:04:38,968
<i>Like this one.</i>

78
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:41,445
<i>Ah, she's got
beautiful lips.</i>

79
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:43,982
<i>But if we got married,
how long would it be</i>

80
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,518
<i>before I got tired
of those lips?</i>

81
00:04:46,586 --> 00:04:47,780
<i>How long would it be</i>

82
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:50,516
<i>before those lips
called me an asshole?</i>

83
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:53,491
<i>And look at her.</i>

84
00:04:53,559 --> 00:04:54,992
<i>What a smile.</i>

85
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:56,619
<i>She looks happy now,</i>

86
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,687
<i>but if I was married to her
for eight years,</i>

87
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:00,460
<i>I'd just be thinking about
that phone bill.</i>

88
00:05:00,533 --> 00:05:01,591
I don't know.

89
00:05:01,668 --> 00:05:04,034
<i>And look at her.</i>

90
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:06,663
<i>Look at those eyes,
those cheekbones.</i>

91
00:05:06,739 --> 00:05:10,937
<i>She's like a painting...
a painting I'd love to mount.</i>

92
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,481
<i>No matter where my head is,</i>

93
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:26,116
<i>when I get to Manhattan,
I'm fine.</i>

94
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:28,956
<i>I love the city,
rats and all.</i>

95
00:05:29,028 --> 00:05:30,859
<i>I love my job.</i>

96
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,455
<i>I'm an investment banker
at a mid-size firm.</i>

97
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:35,592
<i>I'm one of the only blacks
at the company.</i>

98
00:05:35,668 --> 00:05:38,432
<i>As a matter of fact,
there are so few blacks here,</i>

99
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:42,099
<i>I think I know every black
person that works for the firm.</i>

100
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,574
Morning, Pam.

101
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,634
Howdy, Mr. Cooper.

102
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,945
Morning, Ron.

103
00:05:49,015 --> 00:05:50,312
Good morning, Richard.

104
00:06:46,672 --> 00:06:48,640
Okay.

105
00:06:49,709 --> 00:06:52,371
Tracy...

106
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:55,278
this is what we're
doing today, all right?

107
00:06:55,348 --> 00:06:56,474
Seen George?

108
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,073
I'm right here.

109
00:06:58,151 --> 00:06:59,379
See you later, Mary.

110
00:06:59,452 --> 00:07:02,114
George, your wife is on
the phone, and Veronica called.

111
00:07:02,188 --> 00:07:03,746
Wife? I don't want
to talk to her.

112
00:07:03,823 --> 00:07:05,381
Find out what she wants.

113
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:06,891
Call back Veronica.

114
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,551
Rich, you want to
go over that stuff

115
00:07:08,628 --> 00:07:09,617
before Landis gets in?

116
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:10,821
Sure, just,
uh, take off your coat...

117
00:07:10,897 --> 00:07:12,296
Good morning, everyone.

118
00:07:12,365 --> 00:07:14,458
Cooper, how's the
Coleman account?

119
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,126
Incredible. The Narco
funds are up.

120
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:17,328
All right.

121
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:20,304
Let's get to work, people.

122
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:25,574
<i>Pupkin & Langford.
Please hold.</i>

123
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:26,634
<i>Pupkin & Langford.</i>

124
00:07:26,712 --> 00:07:28,873
Lunch?

125
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,709
Well, I got to ask.

126
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,218
Come on, you know
I hate the crowds.

127
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,879
By the time you get your
food, you got to come back.

128
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,150
Well, have fun all by yourself.

129
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,818
I'm gonna get a quick bite and
then get on the Coleman account.

130
00:07:40,893 --> 00:07:43,521
See ya.

131
00:07:43,596 --> 00:07:45,120
<i>Hey, I got nothing
against George,</i>

132
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:46,859
<i>but I just hate
going to lunch</i>

133
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:49,299
<i>at the same time
everybody else does.</i>

134
00:07:49,368 --> 00:07:50,926
<i>It's just way too crowded.</i>

135
00:07:51,003 --> 00:07:53,665
<i>Look at this mess.</i>

136
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,173
<i>It's just not the New York
that I like.</i>

137
00:07:57,310 --> 00:08:00,746
<i>Now, at 2:00,
it's a different story.</i>

138
00:08:00,813 --> 00:08:02,747
<i>Things slow down.</i>

139
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:05,511
<i>That's when I like
to go out.</i>

140
00:08:05,585 --> 00:08:07,951
<i>I can eat,
or I can go shopping,</i>

141
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,920
<i>or I can just
clear my head.</i>

142
00:08:09,989 --> 00:08:13,220
<i>And I can also watch women
and get a good look.</i>

143
00:08:13,292 --> 00:08:15,988
<i>'Cause I know I will never
see them again.</i>

144
00:08:16,062 --> 00:08:18,553
<i>Now, you can't look
at a woman in the suburbs.</i>

145
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,656
<i>You stare at a soccer mom
too long,</i>

146
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:24,225
<i>and they'll post your name
on the Internet.</i>

147
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:37,042
Can I help you find something?

148
00:08:37,116 --> 00:08:39,209
Just looking.

149
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:44,851
Have you seen the new Prada suits?

150
00:08:44,924 --> 00:08:47,051
No, that's okay, that's okay.

151
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,654
Excuse me, sir, would you like
to try a new fragrance today?

152
00:08:51,731 --> 00:08:52,663
Nah, that's okay.

153
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:53,756
Oh.

154
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,767
Hey! Don't spray
that shit on me.

155
00:08:55,835 --> 00:08:58,531
It's really good.

156
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:03,937
Hi, I'm Candy.

157
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,843
Can I help you with something?

158
00:09:06,913 --> 00:09:08,505
Do you have this in blue?

159
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:12,517
You know, I think you
should try this green one.

160
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:13,847
Uh, I-I don't really wear green.

161
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,447
Okay, but this green is hot.

162
00:09:17,523 --> 00:09:18,455
Come on. Trust me.

163
00:09:18,524 --> 00:09:19,582
Let's go try it on.

164
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,684
I'm telling you,
I don't like green.

165
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,799
That looks great on you.

166
00:09:28,868 --> 00:09:29,800
You think so?

167
00:09:29,869 --> 00:09:31,666
Absolutely.
It's sexy.

168
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:32,669
I love it.

169
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,797
I just don't like wearing green.

170
00:09:34,874 --> 00:09:36,432
Yeah, but you should
start wearing green.

171
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:38,773
I mean, you look
really handsome in it.

172
00:09:38,844 --> 00:09:40,505
Hey, Lisa.

173
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,207
Will you tell him
how this shirt looks.

174
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:44,044
Oh, I love it on you!

175
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:45,606
I'm-I'm not just saying that.

176
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:48,279
I think it looks great on you.

177
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:53,424
Daddy's home.

178
00:09:53,492 --> 00:09:54,789
Daddy!

179
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,191
Yeah!

180
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,559
Daddy's home.

181
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,530
Hey, Daddy.

182
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:00,566
How's it going?

183
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:01,565
Pretty good.

184
00:10:01,634 --> 00:10:02,566
Where's Brian?

185
00:10:02,635 --> 00:10:04,102
Oh, he's upstairs napping.

186
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,933
Oh, hey, I've got
all these tests to grade,

187
00:10:06,005 --> 00:10:07,336
so can you do the dishes tonight?

188
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,464
- Yeah, yeah, no problem.
- Great.

189
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,667
Hey, Kelly.

190
00:10:09,742 --> 00:10:11,232
Hi, Daddy.

191
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:12,868
How big is Kelly?

192
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,037
This big.

193
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,375
Yeah. Where's Kelly's ear?

194
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,416
Here.

195
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:19,713
- Where's Kelly's nose?
- Here.

196
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,582
Where's Kelly's esophagus?

197
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:26,890
Give the kid a break;
she's only three.

198
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,187
Hey, there's white
kids that are three

199
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,454
taking the bar right now.

200
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,758
W- H-I-T-E, please.

201
00:10:31,831 --> 00:10:33,059
Okay, okay.

202
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,362
Hey, Kelly, I got you.

203
00:10:35,434 --> 00:10:36,560
Daddy got you.

204
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,661
- Right upside the head.
- You went shopping? Huh.

205
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:40,569
Daddy got you.

206
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,107
I thought you didn't like green.

207
00:10:42,174 --> 00:10:44,734
Figured I'd get something new.

208
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:48,177
It's different.

209
00:10:48,247 --> 00:10:49,714
Pretty.

210
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:53,009
<i>There were days when Brenda
and I got along great.</i>

211
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,677
<i>But we still weren't
having sex.</i>

212
00:10:54,754 --> 00:10:57,314
<i>When a married couple
stops having sex,</i>

213
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,857
<i>at first, they
complain about it.</i>

214
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:02,121
<i>But after a while,
they get used to it.</i>

215
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:04,560
<i>She walks out of the shower,
you don't even look.</i>

216
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:08,396
<i>'Cause you know there's
nothing there for you.</i>

217
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:09,866
<i>The most dangerous time</i>

218
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,927
<i>in a marriage
is when the couple accepts</i>

219
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,495
<i>that they're not having sex.</i>

220
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:16,234
Speak up; I'm in an elevator.

221
00:11:16,308 --> 00:11:18,333
Richard, there's someone
here to see you.

222
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,276
Uh, a client?

223
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,438
She didn't say.

224
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:29,486
Nikki?

225
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:32,456
<i>Wow, Nikki Tru.</i>

226
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,686
<i>I haven't seen her
in eight years.</i>

227
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,159
<i>She was my best
friend's girl.</i>

228
00:11:36,228 --> 00:11:38,753
<i>I was crazy about her.</i>

229
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:39,923
What's wrong?

230
00:11:39,999 --> 00:11:41,398
You didn't think you'd
see me again?

231
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:43,560
No, it's not that;
I'm just surprised.

232
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,934
Wow, you look good, Nikki.

233
00:11:46,005 --> 00:11:47,939
Thanks.

234
00:11:48,007 --> 00:11:50,498
You know, people don't really
smoke in offices anymore.

235
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:51,838
I'm not really a smoker.

236
00:11:51,911 --> 00:11:53,276
I'm just trying
to lose some weight.

237
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,006
So what's that,
a diet cigarette?

238
00:11:56,482 --> 00:11:58,416
I'll put it out.

239
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,918
You look good, Richie.

240
00:12:00,986 --> 00:12:02,613
That's a nice shirt.

241
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:04,087
Thanks.

242
00:12:04,156 --> 00:12:06,989
So, wh-what brings
you around, Nikki?

243
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:08,856
I was in the neighborhood,
heard you worked in the area,

244
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:10,896
thought I'd stop by and say hi.

245
00:12:10,963 --> 00:12:12,260
That's allowed, right?

246
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,595
Yeah. Hi.

247
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:16,134
Hi.

248
00:12:16,202 --> 00:12:19,000
You want to show me
your office or something?

249
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,003
Come on.

250
00:12:20,072 --> 00:12:21,300
Okay.

251
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:22,431
It's good to see you.

252
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,532
Yeah, you, too.

253
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,543
- Which way?
- This way.

254
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,772
<i>NIKKI
Are these your kids?</i>

255
00:12:27,847 --> 00:12:29,576
Yeah, that's
my son Brian

256
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:31,548
and that's my daughter Kelly.

257
00:12:31,617 --> 00:12:33,414
Same mother?

258
00:12:33,486 --> 00:12:35,249
Same mother, my wife, seven years.

259
00:12:35,321 --> 00:12:36,811
No side kids?

260
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:37,821
No side kids.

261
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,255
I know, it's very white of me.

262
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,827
Richard Marcus Cooper is married.

263
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:46,364
Tied the knot, till
death do you part.

264
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,491
Mm-hmm.

265
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:49,795
Something strange about that?

266
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:51,837
No. Just...

267
00:12:51,904 --> 00:12:54,498
not the Richie I knew.

268
00:12:54,573 --> 00:12:55,972
- People change.
- Hmm.

269
00:12:57,476 --> 00:12:59,068
You happily married?

270
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,636
Yeah, I'm-I'm happily married.

271
00:13:01,714 --> 00:13:03,079
No, you're not.

272
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:04,241
You didn't say it right.

273
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,648
Okay, how was I
supposed to say it?

274
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:08,050
Oh, I don't know.

275
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,883
But you're not supposed
to think about it.

276
00:13:09,955 --> 00:13:11,855
I hear ice cracking.

277
00:13:11,924 --> 00:13:13,084
What?

278
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,717
You ever walk across
a frozen river

279
00:13:14,794 --> 00:13:16,762
and hear ice cracking?

280
00:13:16,829 --> 00:13:18,820
It's the scariest sound
in the world.

281
00:13:18,898 --> 00:13:19,865
Hey, hey.

282
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:21,194
My ice is fine.

283
00:13:21,267 --> 00:13:23,701
My-my marriage is frozen solid.

284
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:25,760
You could do a triple axel
on my marriage.

285
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:27,828
One second.

286
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,204
Hello.

287
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:30,367
They're ready to start
the meeting.

288
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,171
Yeah, yeah, I'll
come right now.

289
00:13:32,244 --> 00:13:34,576
So, to be
completely honest,

290
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:36,410
I do need a favor.

291
00:13:36,482 --> 00:13:40,009
Ah. I knew Nikki didn't
come over here for nothing.

292
00:13:40,085 --> 00:13:42,986
Well, I just got back in town,
and I'm trying to get a job,

293
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:44,750
but I need a reference.

294
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,052
Okay, well,
write up a letter,

295
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:47,615
bring it by, and I'll sign it.

296
00:13:47,693 --> 00:13:48,955
No problem. Whoa!

297
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:51,892
Magic.

298
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:55,161
So you just knew
I would sign this, huh?

299
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:58,067
I figured a friend in
need, couldn't resist.

300
00:13:58,137 --> 00:13:59,126
Okay.

301
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,040
Good luck.

302
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:07,601
Thank you...

303
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,705
Mr. Married Man.

304
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:11,841
<i>Even though I hadn't
seen Nikki</i>

305
00:14:11,917 --> 00:14:13,646
<i>- in eight years, I got to say,
- Richard.</i>

306
00:14:13,719 --> 00:14:16,051
<i>she looked even better
than I remembered.</i>

307
00:14:16,288 --> 00:14:17,277
Gonna put these right
on top of the block.

308
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,119
Do I have to eat this, Mommy?

309
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,123
Kelly...
- Hey.

310
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,183
- Hey, Daddy.
- Hey, honey.

311
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:25,354
Mm.

312
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:26,557
I'm almost
done with them,

313
00:14:26,632 --> 00:14:28,327
and dinner will be ready
in a few minutes, okay?

314
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,332
Is baked chicken okay?

315
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:30,333
Ah, you know chicken's great.

316
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:31,460
All right.

317
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,129
Where's my kiss?

318
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:35,139
Ooh, that's a good kiss.

319
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:36,902
What's up, Bri?

320
00:14:36,976 --> 00:14:38,466
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

321
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:39,875
So how was school?

322
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:41,378
You know that test I was giving?

323
00:14:41,447 --> 00:14:42,607
I had to give it again.

324
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:43,943
They all got A's.

325
00:14:44,016 --> 00:14:45,711
Oh, um, Allison wants
to have a playdate

326
00:14:45,784 --> 00:14:46,842
this weekend at her house.

327
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:49,046
Any B-L-A-C-K kids
gonna be there?

328
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,146
A few. Not enough.

329
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,316
You know, I'm thinking of
joining a Mocha Moms group

330
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:54,654
in New Rochelle.

331
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,694
That'll be good.

332
00:14:55,761 --> 00:14:57,092
I got to do something.

333
00:14:59,098 --> 00:15:00,656
Hey, how was, um, work today?

334
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,893
Anything happen?

335
00:15:01,967 --> 00:15:04,663
Ah, nothing much, just work.

336
00:15:04,737 --> 00:15:05,897
<i>I'm not crazy.</i>

337
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:07,802
<i>Would you tell your wife
about Nikki?</i>

338
00:15:07,873 --> 00:15:11,741
<i>But I got to admit, seeing
Nikki got me to thinking.</i>

339
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,335
<i>What would it be like
to be single again?</i>

340
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:16,313
<i>I mean, if I were single,</i>

341
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:18,907
<i>I wouldn't do all that
romance-and-flowers crap.</i>

342
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:22,784
<i>If I were single again,
I would get right to the point.</i>

343
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:24,789
Excuse me, would you
like to have sex with me?

344
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:26,791
- Of course I would.
- Well, come on!

345
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:29,487
<i>When you're single, you're
never at a loss for words.</i>

346
00:15:29,561 --> 00:15:31,688
Excuse me, can I bite your ass?

347
00:15:31,764 --> 00:15:32,856
For $1,000.

348
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:35,127
Come on, let's get
biting, bitch!

349
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,896
<i>When you're single,
you have nothing to lose.</i>

350
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,528
Come with me to
a hotel right now.

351
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,902
But I have an appointment.

352
00:15:40,973 --> 00:15:42,702
Yeah, a pussy appointment.

353
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,437
<i>When you're single,
you're invincible.</i>

354
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:46,443
Excuse me...

355
00:15:46,512 --> 00:15:48,104
Get the fuck out of here!

356
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:50,148
<i>When you're single,
you're alone.</i>

357
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:51,807
I'll fuck you.

358
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:54,182
<i>And that's why
I got married.</i>

359
00:15:59,325 --> 00:16:01,293
<i>When I went to work
the next day,</i>

360
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,124
<i>being single was
the last thing on my mind.</i>

361
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:05,823
<i>I had a lot to do,</i>

362
00:16:05,898 --> 00:16:08,025
<i>there was a big client
I wanted to bring in,</i>

363
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,330
<i>and I needed to be focused.</i>

364
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:14,765
<i>You know what I always say,</i>

365
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,570
valuation's an art not a science.

366
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,769
Hey, want to go to lunch?

367
00:16:18,844 --> 00:16:20,778
I got a plan how we can
reel in EuroTech.

368
00:16:20,846 --> 00:16:22,006
I'm gonna pass on the lunch,

369
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:23,708
but let's talk about it
when you get back.

370
00:16:23,782 --> 00:16:25,875
Have fun with yourself.

371
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:27,179
Walter, listen,

372
00:16:27,252 --> 00:16:28,810
I know you're in bed
with Cross and Lubitsch,

373
00:16:28,887 --> 00:16:29,876
but I'm telling you right now,

374
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,252
you're gonna see
some things in the...

375
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:33,052
There's a Nikki Tru on line one.

376
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,285
Tell her to hold.

377
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,123
Well, I just
want you to know

378
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:38,959
that our doors are always open.

379
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:40,726
All right, take care, Walter.

380
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:43,594
Nikki.

381
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:46,137
Hey.

382
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:47,968
I got the job.

383
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,371
Good.

384
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:50,738
So as a thank you,

385
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:53,972
I was thinking you should
let me take you to lunch.

386
00:16:54,046 --> 00:16:56,207
You know, I don't normally
do lunch till late.

387
00:16:56,281 --> 00:16:57,976
Well, that's okay,
'cause I'm still in bed,

388
00:16:58,050 --> 00:17:01,577
but I could get in the shower
and be to you in about an hour.

389
00:17:01,653 --> 00:17:02,642
You know, I got

390
00:17:02,721 --> 00:17:04,245
a lot of work to do, Nikki.

391
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:07,850
But you are gonna
eat lunch, right?

392
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:09,757
So I'll be there at 2:00.

393
00:17:09,828 --> 00:17:11,887
Okay?

394
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:12,953
Okay.

395
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:13,964
Good.

396
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,466
Bye.

397
00:17:17,136 --> 00:17:19,934
Excuse me, miss,
there's no smoking.

398
00:17:20,005 --> 00:17:21,939
Okay, I'm putting it out.

399
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,904
I live on the West Side
with Teddy.

400
00:17:25,978 --> 00:17:27,570
He has a place here
and in D.C.,

401
00:17:27,646 --> 00:17:29,580
although most of
my stuff is in D.C.

402
00:17:29,648 --> 00:17:31,980
So how'd you meet
Teddy from D.C.?

403
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:33,018
He's a club promoter.

404
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,076
I met him out.

405
00:17:35,154 --> 00:17:36,086
You know how it goes.

406
00:17:36,155 --> 00:17:37,122
Yeah.

407
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:40,852
So do I know your wife?

408
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:42,826
I don't think so.

409
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:44,590
Is she white?

410
00:17:44,663 --> 00:17:46,494
No.

411
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,123
Why-why would you ask that?

412
00:17:49,201 --> 00:17:50,600
Don't get offended.

413
00:17:50,669 --> 00:17:52,432
Remember that girl you brought
to Andre's party?

414
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,598
It was one girl at one party.

415
00:17:55,674 --> 00:17:57,141
I- I go out with
one white girl,

416
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,471
all of a sudden, I'm Prince?

417
00:17:58,544 --> 00:18:00,273
No, it was just a question.

418
00:18:00,345 --> 00:18:02,336
I didn't mean anything by it.

419
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,117
So do you and your black wife
still fuck?

420
00:18:08,187 --> 00:18:10,212
And what's it to you?

421
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,847
Mmm, just curious.

422
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,915
Most of the people I know
who are still married

423
00:18:13,992 --> 00:18:16,119
say that after a while,
they don't fuck.

424
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:17,719
So do you love Teddy?

425
00:18:17,796 --> 00:18:20,230
You didn't answer my question.

426
00:18:20,299 --> 00:18:22,460
'Cause it's none
of your fucking business.

427
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,559
I'll take that as a no.

428
00:18:27,406 --> 00:18:29,840
So, Mr. Married Man,

429
00:18:29,908 --> 00:18:32,069
how did you meet
this black wife of yours?

430
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:33,372
You don't want to know.

431
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:34,878
No, I do.

432
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:35,971
Sort of.

433
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:38,209
I was...

434
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:41,548
coming from a meeting,
I was walking by the park,

435
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:44,817
<i>and she was there
with her class,</i>

436
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,949
<i>this beautiful woman
with these kids.</i>

437
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,788
<i>I don't know-
there was just something</i>

438
00:18:48,861 --> 00:18:50,556
<i>really calm about her.</i>

439
00:18:50,629 --> 00:18:52,824
<i>And I was like,
"I got to meet her. "</i>

440
00:18:52,898 --> 00:18:53,956
<i>Wow.</i>

441
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,592
I guess I was wrong.

442
00:18:56,668 --> 00:18:58,727
You do love your wife.

443
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,034
I've thought about it.

444
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:04,974
Doing the whole wife thing,
having kids.

445
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:07,068
I'm getting a little old
for the club scene.

446
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,080
I don't even know how you do it.

447
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,672
Hanging out late,

448
00:19:10,749 --> 00:19:12,842
- eating cheeseburgers at 4 in the morning.
- God...

449
00:19:12,918 --> 00:19:14,579
Come on.

450
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,553
You used to love this shit.

451
00:19:16,622 --> 00:19:18,385
You just let yourself get old.

452
00:19:18,457 --> 00:19:20,948
I just let myself get bored.

453
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,254
This was fun.

454
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:29,061
We should do this again.

455
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:31,728
Yeah. Maybe.

456
00:19:31,803 --> 00:19:33,395
Okay.

457
00:19:43,115 --> 00:19:45,310
<i>Saturday is the one day</i>

458
00:19:45,384 --> 00:19:47,215
<i>I like to sit in
my house and relax.</i>

459
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:49,811
<i>Unfortunately,
it's also the same day</i>

460
00:19:49,888 --> 00:19:52,948
<i>that Brenda likes to go
into Manhattan and shop.</i>

461
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:55,152
<i>Brenda didn't like
living in the city,</i>

462
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,821
<i>but she sure liked
buying her clothes there.</i>

463
00:20:01,667 --> 00:20:03,157
Honey, why don't you get these?

464
00:20:03,235 --> 00:20:04,167
I like them.

465
00:20:04,236 --> 00:20:05,260
Oh, yeah.

466
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:06,736
Okay, well, let's
find your size

467
00:20:06,805 --> 00:20:07,999
so that you can wear them.

468
00:20:08,073 --> 00:20:10,473
Ah, come on, we drove
all the way to the city.

469
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,339
You could've got those
at the Panty Depot.

470
00:20:12,411 --> 00:20:14,106
Oh, come on.
No, I like these.

471
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,840
- And they're comfortable,and they're cute.
- Richard?

472
00:20:15,914 --> 00:20:17,575
Richard.

473
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,279
I thought you lived in Westchester.

474
00:20:20,352 --> 00:20:22,183
- What are you doing here?
- Hey.

475
00:20:22,254 --> 00:20:23,744
Nikki, Brenda.

476
00:20:23,822 --> 00:20:25,153
Brenda, Nikki.

477
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,691
- Hi.
- Hi.

478
00:20:28,160 --> 00:20:29,559
Nikki's an old friend.

479
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,926
Uh, what's it been,
like, seven, eight years?

480
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:33,294
At least.

481
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:36,425
Uh, Nikki used to date
Nelson, remember?

482
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:38,435
Yes. Yes!

483
00:20:38,503 --> 00:20:39,663
Right.

484
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:41,729
And who is this handsome guy?

485
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:42,796
Oh, well, that's my Brian.

486
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,808
And that's Kelly.

487
00:20:44,876 --> 00:20:45,900
Hi.

488
00:20:45,978 --> 00:20:46,945
She's gorgeous.

489
00:20:47,012 --> 00:20:48,001
Of course, like her mom.

490
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,069
Thank you.

491
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:50,045
Say, "thank you," Kelly.

492
00:20:50,115 --> 00:20:51,673
Thank you.

493
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,308
These are great.

494
00:20:53,385 --> 00:20:54,409
Where did you get these?

495
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,647
Is this the Heavenly Collection?

496
00:20:56,722 --> 00:20:57,984
No, they're from
the Latifah Collection.

497
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,250
Okay.

498
00:20:59,324 --> 00:21:00,586
Stop.

499
00:21:00,659 --> 00:21:02,422
Um, actually,
I don't know what they are.

500
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:03,483
But I got them downstairs.

501
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:05,723
Well, I should go pay for these.

502
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:08,957
Um, it was really
nice to meet you.

503
00:21:09,034 --> 00:21:10,228
Yes.

504
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,896
And it was great
seeing you, Richard.

505
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,303
Oh, great to see you.

506
00:21:15,374 --> 00:21:16,432
Guys.

507
00:21:16,508 --> 00:21:18,203
Bye-bye.

508
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:23,274
So she's the
one that, uh,

509
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,441
Nelson tried to
kill himself over?

510
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,849
Yeah, he-he was going
through a lot back then.

511
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,648
Huh.

512
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,586
Yeah, guess he was.

513
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,663
I'm gonna take these back.

514
00:21:39,731 --> 00:21:41,528
<i>Okay, that was a lie.</i>

515
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:43,295
<i>But big deal.</i>

516
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:44,767
<i>I mean, nothing happened.</i>

517
00:21:44,836 --> 00:21:46,736
<i>Nikki's a friend.</i>

518
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:48,170
<i>An old friend.</i>

519
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,732
<i>I mean, I've known Nikki
longer than I've known Brenda.</i>

520
00:21:51,810 --> 00:21:53,675
<i>She used to date Nelson.</i>

521
00:21:53,745 --> 00:21:56,145
<i>We had a lot of fun together.</i>

522
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:58,808
<i>I mean, sh-she
makes me laugh.</i>

523
00:21:58,884 --> 00:22:01,512
<i>Th-There's nothing
wrong with that, right?</i>

524
00:22:01,586 --> 00:22:04,749
<i>Nikki's an old friend,
a good friend.</i>

525
00:22:04,823 --> 00:22:07,724
<i>A friend I can't
tell my wife about.</i>

526
00:22:07,793 --> 00:22:08,725
Morning, Richard.

527
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,625
- Nikki called.
- Five minutes ago.

528
00:22:10,696 --> 00:22:12,596
She said she'll be by at 6:00.

529
00:22:12,664 --> 00:22:14,632
Is there something wrong?

530
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:15,632
No.

531
00:22:15,701 --> 00:22:17,760
- Nothing.
- Nothing at all.

532
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:22,128
Wall sconces?

533
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:23,640
Well, they're not expensive

534
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:25,700
and we can get an electrician
to put them in.

535
00:22:25,777 --> 00:22:27,574
What do you think of art deco?

536
00:22:27,646 --> 00:22:29,238
Art deco's fine.

537
00:22:29,314 --> 00:22:30,747
Hey.

538
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:31,976
Okay, if we go with art deco,

539
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:33,278
we might have to reupholster
the couch.

540
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,183
I thought we were
talking about wall sconces.

541
00:22:35,253 --> 00:22:36,550
Well, they have to match, honey.

542
00:22:36,621 --> 00:22:38,452
If they don't match,
then I got to change the rug.

543
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:40,081
- If I have to change the rug...
- I guess you're right.

544
00:22:40,158 --> 00:22:42,786
Uh, honey, could we talk
about this later?

545
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:46,155
Yes. Look, I have to go-
it's parent-teacher night.

546
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:48,324
I fixed you a plate, so just
heat it up when you get home.

547
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,164
Okay. So I'll-I'll
talk to you later.

548
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,235
Wall sconces.

549
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:58,105
Sounds fun.

550
00:22:58,176 --> 00:22:59,507
When exactly do you start

551
00:22:59,578 --> 00:23:01,478
getting calls at work
about wall sconces?

552
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:02,808
Right after you get married.

553
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,849
I mean, before you get married,
you get calls like...

554
00:23:04,916 --> 00:23:07,749
I can't wait to suck your dick.

555
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:10,947
Then, after you get married,
you get calls like...

556
00:23:11,022 --> 00:23:13,149
I can't wait for you
to come home

557
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:15,352
and see these drapes.

558
00:23:15,427 --> 00:23:18,328
Poor Mr. Married Man.

559
00:23:18,397 --> 00:23:20,388
I hope you don't mind me
stopping by like this,

560
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:22,160
but I bought something
for your kids.

561
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:24,202
I haven't been able to stop
thinking about you guys.

562
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,861
Hey, you didn't have
to get me anything.

563
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:26,869
I know.

564
00:23:26,938 --> 00:23:28,803
Thanks.

565
00:23:28,874 --> 00:23:30,808
This stuff's expensive.

566
00:23:30,876 --> 00:23:33,242
Oh, don't worry about it.

567
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:35,643
I put it on Teddy's credit card.

568
00:23:35,714 --> 00:23:37,807
So now I owe Teddy some money.

569
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:42,885
So you're the expert-
what do you think?

570
00:23:42,954 --> 00:23:44,819
Would I make a good wife?

571
00:23:44,890 --> 00:23:46,482
Nikki, you don't want
to be a wife.

572
00:23:46,558 --> 00:23:47,490
Why?

573
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,548
You want a wedding.

574
00:23:48,627 --> 00:23:49,992
You want the show.

575
00:23:50,061 --> 00:23:51,961
Mm-hmm.

576
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,657
What are you looking at?

577
00:23:53,732 --> 00:23:55,723
You have any singles?

578
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,166
Yeah, I should have
about seven, eight bucks.

579
00:23:57,235 --> 00:23:58,167
What do you need?

580
00:23:58,236 --> 00:23:59,828
Just give me all of it.

581
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:03,341
All right, I'm gonna have
to break into my stripper stash.

582
00:24:08,246 --> 00:24:09,474
What are you doing?

583
00:24:09,548 --> 00:24:11,448
Feeding the fish.

584
00:24:11,516 --> 00:24:13,643
Come here.

585
00:24:13,718 --> 00:24:15,208
Look.

586
00:24:17,823 --> 00:24:19,085
Okay, who is gonna get it?

587
00:24:19,157 --> 00:24:20,146
Oh, look at this guy.

588
00:24:22,227 --> 00:24:23,251
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

589
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:24,260
Whoo...!

590
00:24:24,329 --> 00:24:25,421
Shh!

591
00:24:25,497 --> 00:24:28,160
It's just a dollar.

592
00:24:28,233 --> 00:24:29,325
It's just a buck.

593
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,062
- This is decadent.
- Try it.

594
00:24:31,136 --> 00:24:32,398
All right.
All right, here we go.

595
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:34,871
Whoo!

596
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:35,929
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

597
00:24:36,007 --> 00:24:36,996
Yeah!

598
00:24:37,075 --> 00:24:38,702
You're going to cause a riot.

599
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,005
Well done!

600
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:44,438
Yes!

601
00:24:44,516 --> 00:24:45,915
Oh, wow!

602
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:49,145
Ooh, look at the homeless guy.

603
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,882
Oh, get the mon...
Oh, he needs it.

604
00:24:50,956 --> 00:24:52,116
Never gonna get it.

605
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:53,179
Nope. Going too slow.

606
00:24:53,258 --> 00:24:54,657
Come on, homeless guy.
You need that money.

607
00:24:56,061 --> 00:24:57,722
Get it.

608
00:24:57,796 --> 00:24:59,354
- Nope.
- Oh!

609
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:01,422
White man wins again.

610
00:25:16,715 --> 00:25:18,740
<i>That was fun.</i>

611
00:25:18,817 --> 00:25:21,217
<i>That was too much fun.</i>

612
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:22,548
<i>You know what?</i>

613
00:25:22,621 --> 00:25:24,816
<i>I better take my wife
out to dinner</i>

614
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:27,916
<i>and get the stench of fun
with another woman off of me.</i>

615
00:25:28,226 --> 00:25:31,491
<i>I don't even want to go that way;
you can't go down the FDR.</i>

616
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:32,825
Oh, God, no.
- It's insane.

617
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,889
<i>Okay, this is safe.</i>

618
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,763
<i>Dinner with
Allan and Jennifer.</i>

619
00:25:36,835 --> 00:25:37,995
<i>Once you get married,</i>

620
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,764
<i>you only hang out
with other married people.</i>

621
00:25:39,838 --> 00:25:41,135
<i>Why?</i>

622
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:44,437
<i>'Cause no single person
could stand to be around you.</i>

623
00:25:44,509 --> 00:25:46,477
<i>It wasn't always like this.</i>

624
00:25:46,545 --> 00:25:50,311
<i>We all used to talk
about sex, politics, art.</i>

625
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,543
<i>But now, all we ever
talk about is our kids.</i>

626
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,175
Of course, I had
to miss the end,

627
00:25:54,252 --> 00:25:56,550
because I had a little
exploding diaper problem.

628
00:25:56,621 --> 00:25:58,179
<i>And when it's
not our kids,</i>

629
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,224
<i>it's always the
same conversation.</i>

630
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,919
<i>First, there's
the rap conversation.</i>

631
00:26:01,993 --> 00:26:03,984
...hos, hos, hos
in different area codes.

632
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,758
I'm kind of wondering,
did anybody have a nice mama?

633
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:08,093
Was it a situation
where their mama

634
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:09,098
smacked them
upside their head,

635
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:10,464
and they said, "Bitch!"

636
00:26:10,535 --> 00:26:12,162
<i>Then there's the conversation
about the Jews.</i>

637
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:13,761
They had it just as bad as us.

638
00:26:13,838 --> 00:26:14,930
Black folks need
to take care of themselves

639
00:26:15,006 --> 00:26:16,496
just as well as the Jews
take care of themselves.

640
00:26:16,575 --> 00:26:18,133
Except we can't stick together-
that's the problem.

641
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:21,303
We're too busy buying
spinning rims and gold teeth.

642
00:26:21,379 --> 00:26:23,370
You think Steven Spielberg
got spinning rims?

643
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:26,110
<i>And no group of people
are too sophisticated to have</i>

644
00:26:26,184 --> 00:26:27,651
<i>a conversation
about Michael Jackson.</i>

645
00:26:27,719 --> 00:26:28,879
I blame Joe.

646
00:26:28,954 --> 00:26:30,478
Please, what grown-ass man

647
00:26:30,555 --> 00:26:32,216
sleeps in a bed with kids?

648
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:34,383
Michael Jackson
just didn't have a childhood.

649
00:26:34,459 --> 00:26:37,053
Hey, man, childhood's only
12, 15 years.

650
00:26:37,128 --> 00:26:38,459
Michael's, like, 50.

651
00:26:38,530 --> 00:26:41,465
How many sliding boards
does this nigga need?

652
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,660
You know good and well you would
not let that man babysit your kids.

653
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:46,727
I wouldn't let Michael Jackson
watch my kids on TV.

654
00:26:46,805 --> 00:26:48,466
Amen.

655
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,167
Maybe he thought
the little boy was 18.

656
00:26:50,241 --> 00:26:51,674
You can't confuse the little boy.

657
00:26:51,743 --> 00:26:53,142
Give me a break.

658
00:26:53,211 --> 00:26:54,269
Just yesterday, little Sharon

659
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,643
came into the room
singing "Magic Stick. "

660
00:26:55,714 --> 00:26:57,545
I said, "Magic Stick"? Little
girl, you're four years old.

661
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,243
What do you know
about a magic stick?"

662
00:26:59,317 --> 00:27:01,148
Can I take your drink orders?

663
00:27:01,219 --> 00:27:02,516
Honey?

664
00:27:02,587 --> 00:27:04,248
Uh, you know what?
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

665
00:27:04,322 --> 00:27:05,584
Honey, can you just
get me some water?

666
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:06,817
Think I'll take a ginger ale.

667
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:07,823
I'll have a Chardonnay.

668
00:27:07,892 --> 00:27:09,450
Okay.

669
00:27:09,527 --> 00:27:11,586
Excuse me, can I talk
to you for a second?

670
00:27:11,663 --> 00:27:13,221
Is there a problem, sir?

671
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,731
Yes, there's a problem.

672
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,131
See, I came here
for a lovely dinner

673
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:18,567
with my wife
and some friends,

674
00:27:18,637 --> 00:27:20,468
and next thing I know
is I got these big tits

675
00:27:20,538 --> 00:27:22,199
asking me if I want a drink.

676
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,468
Do you mean your waitperson?

677
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:26,737
Listen, man, I'm with my wife.

678
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,278
I don't need this shit.

679
00:27:28,346 --> 00:27:31,747
I don't need some girl, with
her big-ass village feeders,

680
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,545
asking me if I need some help.

681
00:27:33,618 --> 00:27:34,812
Is this Hooters?

682
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:35,818
No, sir.

683
00:27:35,887 --> 00:27:37,218
- Is it Hooters?
- No, sir.

684
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,812
I know this ain't Hooters,
'cause-'cause if it is,

685
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:41,154
you owe me some
fucking buffalo wings.

686
00:27:41,226 --> 00:27:44,127
Sir, what can I do
to make this better?

687
00:27:46,131 --> 00:27:49,032
See that guy right there?

688
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,658
Yes, I do.

689
00:27:50,735 --> 00:27:53,363
That's my waiter.

690
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:55,733
Thank you, sir.

691
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,638
Thank you.

692
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,224
What are you doing here?

693
00:28:20,298 --> 00:28:21,788
You okay?

694
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:24,334
So he just got up
and said, "It's over"?

695
00:28:24,402 --> 00:28:25,733
No, you don't understand.

696
00:28:25,804 --> 00:28:28,671
If we're fucking and I
fall asleep, that's fine.

697
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,298
If we're fucking
and we both fall asleep,

698
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:32,002
that's okay, too,
but if we're fucking

699
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,875
and you fall asleep,
it's-it's fucked up!

700
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:37,744
He didn't say it's over,
but I know it's over.

701
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:40,546
You-you got to excuse her;
she's upset.

702
00:28:40,618 --> 00:28:42,609
The fuck are you looking at?!

703
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:48,584
Our stop's coming up.

704
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:52,923
<i>When Nikki came by to see
me in the afternoon,</i>

705
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:55,830
<i>it wasn't really a big deal.</i>

706
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:59,336
<i>But when we walked through
the office at 9:00 a. m...</i>

707
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:00,530
Good morning.

708
00:29:00,605 --> 00:29:03,972
<i>...people looked at me
like I was crazy.</i>

709
00:29:04,042 --> 00:29:06,272
<i>I mean crazy.</i>

710
00:29:09,147 --> 00:29:10,978
It's like we've been
breaking up for months,

711
00:29:11,049 --> 00:29:13,040
and I'm just finding out
about it now.

712
00:29:13,118 --> 00:29:14,176
Well, that's how
relationships are.

713
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:17,153
You add how long
you been together,

714
00:29:17,222 --> 00:29:18,689
and then you divide it by two,

715
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,384
and that's how long
you been breaking up.

716
00:29:20,458 --> 00:29:22,983
So if you get a divorce
after 20 years,

717
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:24,790
you been breaking up for ten.

718
00:29:24,863 --> 00:29:26,854
That's right.

719
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:33,364
So can I stay with you
for a couple days?

720
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,566
Nikki, my wife...

721
00:29:40,578 --> 00:29:42,205
Oh...

722
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,373
I'm just playing with you.

723
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,551
You should see the look
on your face right now.

724
00:29:50,555 --> 00:29:54,047
Okay, I'm not trying to get rid
of you, Nikki, but I really...

725
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,252
iPod.

726
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,558
You got some nigga ears.

727
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,189
Nigga what?

728
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,063
Some old-ass nigga ears.

729
00:30:03,134 --> 00:30:05,762
Look at this, Levert, Patti
LaBelle, Luther Vandross.

730
00:30:05,837 --> 00:30:07,464
You know, white people
make music, too.

731
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:08,471
I got George Michael.

732
00:30:08,540 --> 00:30:09,564
Doesn't count.

733
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:12,667
Okay, I'm gonna
give you my iPod,

734
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:14,735
and you are gonna give me yours.

735
00:30:14,813 --> 00:30:15,780
Okay.

736
00:30:15,847 --> 00:30:18,008
When you get a chance,

737
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:22,041
I want you to listen to that song.

738
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,088
Can I get back to work now?

739
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:57,477
I think he might
be off the phone.

740
00:32:08,293 --> 00:32:10,284
Richard.

741
00:32:10,361 --> 00:32:11,385
That girl is here to see you.

742
00:32:11,462 --> 00:32:12,724
Well, just send her in.

743
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:13,786
Richard...

744
00:32:14,832 --> 00:32:17,357
...can I ask you something?

745
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:19,494
Hi.

746
00:32:19,570 --> 00:32:21,003
It can wait.

747
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,338
I don't think your
secretaries like me.

748
00:32:26,411 --> 00:32:27,776
Hey, they don't like me, either.

749
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:29,836
You know, if you keep
showing up like this,

750
00:32:29,914 --> 00:32:31,438
we're gonna have
to get you a job here.

751
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:32,676
People are gonna start talking.

752
00:32:32,750 --> 00:32:34,718
Oh, let them talk.

753
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:36,378
I need you to do me a favor.

754
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:38,649
Can you come uptown with
me to look at a place?

755
00:32:38,723 --> 00:32:40,657
You know, I-I got
a lot of work to do.

756
00:32:40,725 --> 00:32:42,022
I got to get
out of Teddy's,

757
00:32:42,093 --> 00:32:45,460
and... he's supposed
to be out of town.

758
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:47,828
I'd like to be out by
the time he gets back.

759
00:32:49,834 --> 00:32:50,823
Are you okay?

760
00:32:50,902 --> 00:32:54,099
Can you come with me?

761
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:55,662
Yeah, yeah.

762
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,367
- Let me just check.
- Okay.

763
00:32:57,442 --> 00:33:01,003
Tracy, what's my rest
of the day look like?

764
00:33:01,079 --> 00:33:03,206
You and George have a
conference call at 3:00.

765
00:33:03,281 --> 00:33:04,509
Damn. George!

766
00:33:04,582 --> 00:33:05,549
Yeah?

767
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,413
You need me for that call at 3:00?

768
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:09,248
I do. Why?

769
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:10,548
I got to do something.

770
00:33:10,621 --> 00:33:12,782
I mean, I-I should be back,
but if I'm not,

771
00:33:12,857 --> 00:33:14,017
you can handle it, right?

772
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:16,253
Yeah, I got it, don't worry.

773
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:17,760
Hi, I'm George.

774
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,262
- Nikki.
- Nice to meet you.

775
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:21,025
Likewise.

776
00:33:22,066 --> 00:33:23,693
So, I'll see you later?

777
00:33:23,768 --> 00:33:25,599
You tell me.

778
00:33:31,809 --> 00:33:34,039
<i>You sure this is
what you want?</i>

779
00:33:34,112 --> 00:33:36,273
<i>It's what I can afford.</i>

780
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:38,178
So, where do you work?

781
00:33:38,249 --> 00:33:41,150
I'm a hostess at a place downtown
called The White Bar.

782
00:33:41,219 --> 00:33:44,620
Oh, that's nice.

783
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,089
Well, here you go.

784
00:33:47,158 --> 00:33:50,184
Washer and dryer
on the third floor,

785
00:33:50,261 --> 00:33:51,558
pay phone on the second floor.

786
00:33:51,629 --> 00:33:53,324
Don't knock on my door for change.

787
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:54,990
Get your own damn quarters.

788
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:57,660
Um, there was something
in the ad about cable.

789
00:33:57,735 --> 00:33:59,896
I got jumper cables,
if you need 'em.

790
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:00,995
Okay.

791
00:34:01,072 --> 00:34:02,471
And don't blame me
if the bed's

792
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:03,973
not big enough for both of you.

793
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,509
This place is really for students.

794
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:07,066
Oh, we are not a couple.

795
00:34:07,145 --> 00:34:08,578
Yeah, yeah, I-I'm just a friend.

796
00:34:08,646 --> 00:34:09,738
Oh.

797
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:12,180
I guess that's a Super Bowl
ring, huh?

798
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:13,774
You a Jet or a Packer?

799
00:34:13,851 --> 00:34:15,614
Uh-huh.

800
00:34:15,686 --> 00:34:17,483
Which one of you friends
is paying the rent?

801
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,920
I am.

802
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:21,288
Sure you are, baby.

803
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,759
I never thought I'd be
back in one of these.

804
00:34:23,828 --> 00:34:26,126
This is where everybody ends up.

805
00:34:30,268 --> 00:34:33,965
<i>.. a wooden Barton hutch
made of pine in Al's backyard.</i>

806
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:37,599
This is a project an experienced
do-it-yourselfer could tackle,

807
00:34:37,675 --> 00:34:42,135
since this shed is pre-cut
and ready to assemble.

808
00:34:42,213 --> 00:34:44,113
- Hey, fellas.
Hi!

809
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:45,911
- How are you guys?
- Very well, thanks.

810
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:48,952
That doesn't look so hard;
we can do that out back.

811
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,818
I'm getting splinters
just watching this.

812
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:59,263
I got to hand it to you-
you knocked it out the park.

813
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,821
It looks like EuroTech
may come aboard.

814
00:35:01,899 --> 00:35:04,299
Hey, it's not a done deal,
and when it gets done,

815
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:06,131
I couldn't have done it without you.

816
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:08,468
What do you say we go grab
some lunch and celebrate?

817
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:11,406
I- I'd love to... but
I got other plans.

818
00:35:11,476 --> 00:35:13,273
Hey, guys. You ready?

819
00:35:13,344 --> 00:35:15,574
Can I talk to you for a second?

820
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:16,874
Yeah, sure.

821
00:35:16,948 --> 00:35:18,313
Inside.

822
00:35:18,382 --> 00:35:19,644
- Be right back.
- Okay.

823
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:21,241
I'm sorry. I won't keep him long.

824
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,014
No problem.

825
00:35:27,692 --> 00:35:29,660
Okay, what is it?

826
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:32,560
Are you aware of what
you're getting yourself into?

827
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,619
What are you talking about?

828
00:35:33,698 --> 00:35:35,632
Nikki- she's here every day.

829
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,827
George, she's just a friend.

830
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,369
A friend? Come on.

831
00:35:39,437 --> 00:35:42,270
I've had friends before- they
don't fucking look like Nikki.

832
00:35:42,340 --> 00:35:45,070
Look, you got a good situation
at home, you got two kids...

833
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,838
I'm not fucking her.

834
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:48,776
No, she's fucking you;
you just don't know it.

835
00:35:48,846 --> 00:35:52,543
I can't believe I'm hearing
this shit from you,

836
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:54,084
of all people.

837
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,382
You cheat on your
wife all the time.

838
00:35:56,454 --> 00:35:58,547
Last year, you were
fucking Tracy and Mary.

839
00:35:58,623 --> 00:35:59,885
I didn't say shit to you.

840
00:35:59,957 --> 00:36:01,481
That's different.

841
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:02,924
I don't give a fuck.

842
00:36:02,994 --> 00:36:04,621
I can fuck a girl, go home,

843
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:07,027
kiss my wife good night
and sleep like a baby.

844
00:36:07,098 --> 00:36:09,794
You, on the other hand,
got emotions.

845
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:12,836
You're like Captain
Save-A-Ho, all right?

846
00:36:12,904 --> 00:36:15,464
You like to be needed,
and that bitch knows it.

847
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:18,439
Are we done?

848
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:20,739
I'm not getting
in your shit, all right?

849
00:36:20,811 --> 00:36:23,041
I just...

850
00:36:23,114 --> 00:36:25,082
Be careful, okay?

851
00:36:30,688 --> 00:36:32,383
Hey.

852
00:36:32,456 --> 00:36:33,616
What's wrong?

853
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,352
You look upset.

854
00:36:35,426 --> 00:36:37,394
We can't do this anymore.

855
00:36:37,461 --> 00:36:38,723
Do what?
What are you talking about?

856
00:36:38,796 --> 00:36:41,765
This whole... lunch in
the afternoon thing.

857
00:36:41,832 --> 00:36:44,027
It doesn't look good;
we really should stop.

858
00:36:44,101 --> 00:36:45,193
We're not doing anything.

859
00:36:45,269 --> 00:36:46,327
It's not like we're fucking.

860
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:47,632
It is like
we're fucking,

861
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:49,502
only thing, we're
not fucking,

862
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:51,804
and I feel all the guilt
as if I'm fucking you

863
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,242
without any of the pleasure
of actually fucking you.

864
00:36:54,312 --> 00:36:56,337
I don't want things to
get any more complicated.

865
00:36:56,414 --> 00:36:58,882
I'm not trying
to complicate anything.

866
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,248
I like you, Richard.

867
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:04,015
I don't like a lot of people.

868
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:06,989
I like you 'cause you're safe.

869
00:37:08,092 --> 00:37:10,322
You don't want anything from me.

870
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:12,419
Okay?

871
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:15,325
Okay.

872
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,357
So, you want to get
something to eat?

873
00:37:18,436 --> 00:37:19,733
No.

874
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:21,965
I have something else planned.

875
00:37:47,398 --> 00:37:49,628
Wow.

876
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,827
I've been thinking
about coming here.

877
00:37:51,902 --> 00:37:52,960
I knew you'd like it.

878
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:57,373
You should have one of these.

879
00:37:57,441 --> 00:37:59,739
Wanted one of these
since I was a kid.

880
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:01,778
That I don't know.

881
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,643
What I know is that
I'm gonna get me

882
00:38:03,714 --> 00:38:05,079
a little Porsche one day.

883
00:38:05,149 --> 00:38:08,118
You're going down!
You're going down!

884
00:38:08,185 --> 00:38:09,277
I'm going down, all right.

885
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,284
- Oh!
- Yeah, yeah.

886
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,590
You dirty, dirty...!

887
00:38:38,582 --> 00:38:40,049
What is that?!

888
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:41,277
Richard!

889
00:38:41,352 --> 00:38:43,343
Richard, Brian's asleep ups...!

890
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,258
What is that?

891
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,658
You-You don't like it?

892
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:51,660
No, no, I don't.

893
00:38:51,729 --> 00:38:52,753
And you're making the kids deaf.

894
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,127
Ah, come on, it's not that loud.

895
00:38:54,198 --> 00:38:55,222
Yes, it is.

896
00:38:55,299 --> 00:38:56,266
And you know what?

897
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:58,359
I was in my car
the other day, and...

898
00:38:58,436 --> 00:39:00,131
Where did my CDs go?

899
00:39:00,204 --> 00:39:02,195
Wh-Where's my,
where's my Peabo Bryson?

900
00:39:02,273 --> 00:39:03,934
Where's my Usher?
Where's my Beyonc?

901
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:06,067
You know, you really got
some nigga ears, honey.

902
00:39:10,181 --> 00:39:11,648
Nigga ears?

903
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:13,206
How many times do I
have to ask you

904
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:15,081
not to talk in front
of the kids like that?

905
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:16,380
You know what?

906
00:39:16,454 --> 00:39:17,546
You just keep doing
what you're doing.

907
00:39:17,621 --> 00:39:18,645
'Cause one of these days,

908
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,623
they won't be asking
where my daddy is,

909
00:39:20,691 --> 00:39:22,352
they'll be asking,
"Where's my nigga?"

910
00:39:24,528 --> 00:39:26,894
Then what are you gonna do?

911
00:39:29,066 --> 00:39:30,863
You know, I tried
calling you yesterday,

912
00:39:30,935 --> 00:39:32,129
and no one could find you.

913
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:35,639
Was probably at lunch.

914
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,037
No, it was almost 4:00.

915
00:39:37,108 --> 00:39:38,200
Aren't you usually back by then?

916
00:39:38,275 --> 00:39:39,970
I mean, I tried
calling you on your cell,

917
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,978
I tried texting you,
you didn't text me back.

918
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:43,104
What did you want?

919
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,169
What difference
does it make

920
00:39:44,248 --> 00:39:45,215
what I wanted?

921
00:39:45,282 --> 00:39:46,647
That was yesterday.

922
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:48,912
You have to tell people
where you are.

923
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:50,385
What if something
happened to the kids?

924
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:51,921
What if I got hit by a car?

925
00:39:51,989 --> 00:39:53,616
Ah, come on, why do you always
have to take it to,

926
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:55,488
"What if I got hit by a car?"

927
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,117
I- I went to the deli,

928
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:58,354
I wanted a chicken salad sandwich.

929
00:39:58,429 --> 00:39:59,589
I- I stood on line.

930
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,255
Uh, when I got to
the front of the line,

931
00:40:01,332 --> 00:40:02,492
I realized I didn't
have a ticket,

932
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,193
so I had to get back on the line.

933
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:05,792
That's it.

934
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:07,861
You make it sound like an alibi.

935
00:40:07,938 --> 00:40:09,496
All you have to do
is answer the phone.

936
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,133
I didn't hear it.

937
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:14,609
All right.

938
00:40:17,148 --> 00:40:18,479
Tomorrow.

939
00:40:18,549 --> 00:40:20,642
Have you thought
about what you want to do?

940
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:22,345
Do you want to see a movie?

941
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,820
Do you want to have brunch
with Jennifer and Allan?

942
00:40:24,889 --> 00:40:27,187
Nah, nah, nah, we do
that all the time.

943
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,816
Let's try something different.

944
00:40:28,893 --> 00:40:31,555
Different?

945
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:32,596
Okay.

946
00:40:52,917 --> 00:40:54,714
Honey, let's go look
at the new Porsches.

947
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,582
Wh... Why?

948
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:57,814
No. No, no, no, no.

949
00:40:57,888 --> 00:40:59,549
In here, it says that
there's something over there

950
00:40:59,623 --> 00:41:01,648
that you're really gonna like.

951
00:41:01,725 --> 00:41:03,215
Oh, yeah. Come on.

952
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:04,261
Let's go.

953
00:41:04,328 --> 00:41:05,955
Bye-bye.

954
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:07,725
Come on, baby.

955
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:34,116
<i>Going to the car show
and looking at the minivans</i>

956
00:41:34,191 --> 00:41:37,888
<i>was like going to a strip
club and looking at the DJ.</i>

957
00:41:40,064 --> 00:41:41,759
<i>Mr. Cooper,</i>

958
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,629
what sectors have the most

959
00:41:43,701 --> 00:41:45,669
growth potential
for our company?

960
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:47,465
Well, Mr. Yuni, what
we're finding now

961
00:41:47,538 --> 00:41:50,598
is that most advertising dollars
are migrating online.

962
00:41:53,744 --> 00:41:55,473
Is that you?

963
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,179
It's me.

964
00:41:59,250 --> 00:42:00,649
- I probably should, uh...
- Mm-hmm.

965
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:03,050
Richard, I have an emergency.

966
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:04,553
I need to ask you something,

967
00:42:04,622 --> 00:42:06,385
but I'm afraid
you're gonna get mad at me.

968
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:08,288
I have to take this.

969
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,621
Um, if you'll
excuse me,

970
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,354
I'll be, I'll be right back.

971
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:20,534
H- Hey, what's up?

972
00:42:20,604 --> 00:42:22,401
I can't really talk right now;
I'm in a meeting.

973
00:42:22,473 --> 00:42:23,599
Okay, really quick.

974
00:42:23,674 --> 00:42:25,073
Just promise you won't
get mad at me.

975
00:42:25,142 --> 00:42:27,167
I won't get mad.

976
00:42:27,244 --> 00:42:28,643
You didn't promise.

977
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:31,806
Okay, I promise.

978
00:42:31,882 --> 00:42:34,817
Will you come with me to get my
stuff out of Teddy's apartment?

979
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,853
Didn't you hear me tell you
I'm in a meeting?

980
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:37,910
Not today,

981
00:42:37,988 --> 00:42:39,148
tomorrow.

982
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,383
Fine.

983
00:42:40,457 --> 00:42:41,924
Okay? I got to go now.

984
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:43,016
Have a good meeting.

985
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:46,857
Oh, and what were your plans?

986
00:42:46,931 --> 00:42:48,023
Three kids?

987
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:49,326
Yeah, could be better.

988
00:42:51,335 --> 00:42:53,200
Small family emergency.

989
00:42:53,270 --> 00:42:55,295
It's under control.

990
00:43:00,344 --> 00:43:02,209
<i>All right, so where's
this guy live?</i>

991
00:43:02,279 --> 00:43:04,076
'Cause I got things to do.

992
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:06,616
Shuttle's in, like, 45 minutes.

993
00:43:06,684 --> 00:43:07,981
Shuttle?

994
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:10,543
Wh-What are you
talking about, shuttle?

995
00:43:10,621 --> 00:43:11,713
To D.C.

996
00:43:11,789 --> 00:43:13,586
Remember I told you,
we have a place there,

997
00:43:13,657 --> 00:43:16,626
and he's out of town, so
now I can get my shit.

998
00:43:16,694 --> 00:43:19,322
I'm not going with you to D.C.

999
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:21,057
You promised.

1000
00:43:21,131 --> 00:43:23,463
I didn't promise to go
with you to another state.

1001
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:25,934
It's not a state, it's a district.

1002
00:43:26,003 --> 00:43:28,301
It's, like, a 30-minute flight.

1003
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:30,704
You must be
out of your fucking mind

1004
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:34,107
if you think I'm getting
on a plane to Washington D.C.

1005
00:43:34,178 --> 00:43:36,874
to go to some guy's house
to get your shit!

1006
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:47,488
Richard?

1007
00:43:47,558 --> 00:43:48,855
Richard, yeah.

1008
00:43:48,926 --> 00:43:51,087
Uh, I have one question for you:

1009
00:43:51,161 --> 00:43:52,219
Where the fuck are you?

1010
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:53,558
No, no, no, don't worry.

1011
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:54,689
I'll be there.

1012
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:56,596
Yeah, something just came up.

1013
00:43:56,667 --> 00:43:57,895
Look, just get here, okay?

1014
00:43:57,968 --> 00:43:59,401
I told you I need
you on this one.

1015
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,563
Tell Mary that
if Nikki calls,

1016
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:02,697
I'll call her tomorrow.

1017
00:44:02,773 --> 00:44:05,537
Tell her yourself
when you get here.

1018
00:44:05,609 --> 00:44:08,203
You're a good liar.

1019
00:44:08,278 --> 00:44:10,576
Listen, we're getting
on the 1:00 shuttle,

1020
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:11,672
not a moment later, okay?

1021
00:44:11,749 --> 00:44:13,307
'Cause I got a meeting at 3:00.

1022
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,079
Okay.

1023
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:30,964
Right here.

1024
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:32,059
- Here?
- Uh-huh.

1025
00:44:32,136 --> 00:44:33,660
What are all these cops doing here?

1026
00:44:33,737 --> 00:44:35,728
Oh, it's kind of
a crazy neighborhood.

1027
00:44:35,806 --> 00:44:37,103
Something's always going down.

1028
00:44:37,174 --> 00:44:38,869
- We'll be right back.
- Okay.

1029
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:46,073
So how many cities
have you lived in

1030
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,084
- with this Teddy guy?
- Hey, police! Open up in there!

1031
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,882
- Uh, here, and New York.
- Open up in there!

1032
00:44:50,954 --> 00:44:52,353
In Miami, I lived with his brother.

1033
00:44:52,423 --> 00:44:53,390
That's where I met him.

1034
00:44:53,457 --> 00:44:54,754
Wait a minute,
you lived with a guy,

1035
00:44:54,825 --> 00:44:57,225
then you left him for his brother?

1036
00:44:57,294 --> 00:44:58,352
How'd you pull that off?

1037
00:44:58,429 --> 00:44:59,555
I got a hard enough time

1038
00:44:59,630 --> 00:45:01,723
telling my wife I want pancakes.

1039
00:45:01,799 --> 00:45:02,891
We're in.

1040
00:45:10,708 --> 00:45:13,233
All right,
now that we're in,

1041
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:14,800
I want you to
get your shit

1042
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,402
and let's get out of here.

1043
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,880
I'm just gonna grab
a few dresses, some shoes,

1044
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:19,881
and then we'll go.

1045
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:21,247
Okay.

1046
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:22,444
Thank you.

1047
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:24,578
Forget "Thank you," just hurry up.

1048
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:30,459
Teddy's doing pretty good.

1049
00:45:30,527 --> 00:45:31,459
Mm-hmm.

1050
00:45:41,472 --> 00:45:44,032
You were on the math team
in high school?

1051
00:45:44,108 --> 00:45:46,167
For two years. Why?

1052
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,335
I don't know.

1053
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,005
Just can't imagine you
solving a problem.

1054
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,878
My Ferretti sweater.

1055
00:45:52,950 --> 00:45:55,783
I had no idea where this was.

1056
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:04,325
Richard Cooper's office.

1057
00:46:04,394 --> 00:46:05,486
Hi, Brenda.

1058
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:08,557
Hey, somebody
around here's

1059
00:46:08,632 --> 00:46:10,566
got some nigga ears.

1060
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:13,398
Excuse me?

1061
00:46:13,470 --> 00:46:15,028
<i>Biz Markie's Greatest Hits.</i>

1062
00:46:15,105 --> 00:46:17,835
That man is a genius.

1063
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:20,240
The genius that wrote
"Pickin' Boogers. "

1064
00:46:20,310 --> 00:46:22,505
"Pickin' Boogers," "The Vapors"

1065
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:24,513
and of course, my favorite...

1066
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:44,825
Okay, Teddy, calm down.

1067
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:46,335
You know you got two strikes.

1068
00:46:46,403 --> 00:46:47,700
There's cops all over the place.

1069
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:50,500
How the fuck y'all
get in here, man?

1070
00:46:50,574 --> 00:46:51,506
Huh?

1071
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:53,008
Who the fuck are you?

1072
00:46:53,076 --> 00:46:55,340
Huh?

1073
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:57,346
What, this the new nigga?

1074
00:46:57,414 --> 00:46:59,382
You fucking him now? Huh?

1075
00:46:59,449 --> 00:47:01,246
You the new nigga, man?

1076
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:03,809
No, no, I'm-I'm not the new nigga.

1077
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:06,219
I've n-never been the nigga,
I'm just a... friend.

1078
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:09,114
How's it going?
Richard Cooper.

1079
00:47:09,593 --> 00:47:10,525
Oh!

1080
00:47:10,594 --> 00:47:11,822
- Teddy!
- Motherfucker!

1081
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:13,226
Teddy, what the fuck's
wrong with you?!

1082
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:15,356
- You bring this stupid-ass nigga
- Stop it!

1083
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:16,456
- in my fucking crib?!
- Teddy!

1084
00:47:16,533 --> 00:47:17,557
Help!

1085
00:47:17,634 --> 00:47:18,794
- Fuck you!
- Somebody help!

1086
00:47:18,869 --> 00:47:20,894
- Take the boot! Take the boot!
- Somebody help us!

1087
00:47:20,971 --> 00:47:21,938
Take the motherfucking boot!

1088
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,734
Hi, Mr. Landis, it's Tracy.

1089
00:47:23,807 --> 00:47:25,832
You like the taste, huh?!
You like the taste?!

1090
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:27,240
- Everybody freeze!
- You like the fucking taste?!

1091
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:28,539
Crunch it down, motherfucker!

1092
00:47:28,612 --> 00:47:29,601
- Hey! Get him now!
- What?!

1093
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,942
He's in a conference meeting.

1094
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,072
- Everyone all right?
We good.

1095
00:47:32,149 --> 00:47:33,116
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

1096
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:35,242
This motherfucker
broke into my crib...

1097
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:36,286
with this bitch here!

1098
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:43,056
Thug life! Thug life!

1099
00:47:43,126 --> 00:47:44,889
Thug life!

1100
00:47:44,962 --> 00:47:46,327
Thug life, nigga!
Thug life!

1101
00:47:46,396 --> 00:47:47,761
Wait, wait, wait,
we can't do this.

1102
00:47:47,831 --> 00:47:48,855
Fuck that!

1103
00:47:48,932 --> 00:47:49,864
Oh, yes, we can!

1104
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:50,991
Thug fucking life!

1105
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:53,059
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

1106
00:47:53,136 --> 00:47:54,501
What the hell is wrong with you?!

1107
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:55,503
He could've killed us!

1108
00:47:55,572 --> 00:47:56,834
You told me he was out of town!

1109
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:58,499
- Sorry!
- And the damn cops coming here!

1110
00:47:58,575 --> 00:47:59,940
What the hell is wrong with you?!

1111
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,978
I should be in a meeting right now!

1112
00:48:07,251 --> 00:48:08,479
No, no.

1113
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,417
No, no, no!

1114
00:48:12,756 --> 00:48:14,815
Could you hurry up?

1115
00:48:35,879 --> 00:48:39,110
I don't care about "Thriller. "

1116
00:48:39,182 --> 00:48:42,948
What kind of grown man
has kids sleeping in his bed?

1117
00:48:43,020 --> 00:48:45,887
He'll never babysit my kids.

1118
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:47,753
Look, we don't have all day.

1119
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:49,257
I'm-I'm sorry, Mr. Yuni.

1120
00:48:49,326 --> 00:48:50,816
I'm-I'm sure
Mr. Cooper will be here

1121
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:53,192
in a moment with the prospectus.

1122
00:48:54,331 --> 00:48:55,696
Where the fuck is he?

1123
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,097
I'm sure he's got
a good explanation.

1124
00:49:00,137 --> 00:49:01,365
Excuse me.

1125
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:03,338
George, there's a call
for you in your office.

1126
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:05,375
Ah. Excuse me.

1127
00:49:05,442 --> 00:49:08,070
Actually, I like "Thriller. "

1128
00:49:08,145 --> 00:49:09,578
Michael's last big one.

1129
00:49:09,646 --> 00:49:10,613
Yeah.

1130
00:49:10,681 --> 00:49:12,342
I knew he was gonna
be a star, you know,

1131
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:13,542
when I saw him on Ed Sullivan.

1132
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,107
All flights in and out

1133
00:49:15,185 --> 00:49:16,311
of New York LaGuardia
have been delayed

1134
00:49:16,386 --> 00:49:18,183
possibly three to four hours.

1135
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:19,552
Thank you for your patience.

1136
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:20,590
George...

1137
00:49:20,657 --> 00:49:22,818
I've been trying
to cover for you.

1138
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:24,861
They want to start-
where the fuck are you?

1139
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:25,895
Landis is pissed.

1140
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:28,864
I'm not going to make it.

1141
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:31,162
Oh, fuck!

1142
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:33,031
Fuck!

1143
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:34,468
Hey, Anita.
How you doing?

1144
00:49:34,538 --> 00:49:35,869
George, calm down.

1145
00:49:35,939 --> 00:49:37,839
You can do this.
You can handle it.

1146
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:39,307
- Just calm down.
- No...

1147
00:49:39,376 --> 00:49:40,274
Goddamn it,

1148
00:49:40,344 --> 00:49:41,538
Richard!

1149
00:49:41,611 --> 00:49:43,545
You're killing me!

1150
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:47,409
I hope she's worth it.

1151
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:55,123
Fuck!

1152
00:50:01,498 --> 00:50:03,432
I'm afraid we either
have to get started

1153
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:04,524
or we have to go.

1154
00:50:04,601 --> 00:50:06,034
We have another appointment.

1155
00:50:06,103 --> 00:50:07,627
Can we get started?

1156
00:50:07,704 --> 00:50:09,763
Of course.
Absolutely.

1157
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,536
Okay, um...

1158
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:14,975
Mr. Yuni, my apologies, uh, but
I have been working very closely

1159
00:50:15,045 --> 00:50:16,376
with Mr. Cooper on this

1160
00:50:16,446 --> 00:50:17,777
and I'm prepared
to walk us through it.

1161
00:50:18,915 --> 00:50:20,439
Um, if you take a look
at, uh, page two...

1162
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:21,779
I'm sorry, page... three.

1163
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,650
Performance chart from 19...

1164
00:50:36,833 --> 00:50:39,631
Hey, baby, you're late.

1165
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:41,432
What happened?

1166
00:50:41,505 --> 00:50:42,767
I got in a fight.

1167
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:43,965
A fight?

1168
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,941
What hap... Why?
What happened?

1169
00:50:46,009 --> 00:50:47,636
I was pulling the car
out the lot,

1170
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:48,939
and this guy cut me off,

1171
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:51,879
and he gets out of his car,
then I got out of my car,

1172
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:53,279
and, next thing I know,
we're on the ground,

1173
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:55,409
- and we're...
- No, stop. No, stop.

1174
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:57,976
That is, that's-that's the
dumbest shit in the world.

1175
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:58,987
I can't believe your...

1176
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:02,150
You're a grown man!
You...

1177
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:03,556
All right, De La Hoya,
you know what?

1178
00:51:03,627 --> 00:51:05,424
You put the dishes away,
and I'm gonna go upstairs.

1179
00:51:05,495 --> 00:51:08,896
I'm gonna pretend
I'm married to a grown man.

1180
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:11,297
WOMAN
... breaking news, this just in.

1181
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:14,235
Today, in national news,
a Washington D.C. man

1182
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:17,102
named Teddy Smith shot
and wounded two police officers.

1183
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:20,109
He was later apprehended
after a violent standoff.

1184
00:51:20,177 --> 00:51:22,145
More news after the break.

1185
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:39,961
Shit.

1186
00:51:49,773 --> 00:51:51,968
Cooper, you're a good banker.

1187
00:51:52,042 --> 00:51:55,170
You've brought a lot
of money to this company.

1188
00:51:55,245 --> 00:51:57,713
Do you think you've brought a
lot of money into this company?

1189
00:51:57,781 --> 00:52:00,409
Yeah, I've-I've, I've
brought some money in.

1190
00:52:00,484 --> 00:52:02,008
Well, in all the years
you've been here,

1191
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:03,916
you've brought in
close to $20 million.

1192
00:52:03,987 --> 00:52:06,046
That's a lot of money, right?

1193
00:52:06,123 --> 00:52:08,114
Right?

1194
00:52:08,191 --> 00:52:10,421
I- I guess so.

1195
00:52:10,494 --> 00:52:13,224
See this quarter?

1196
00:52:13,296 --> 00:52:14,194
See it?

1197
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:16,095
Yes, I see it.

1198
00:52:16,166 --> 00:52:18,396
This quarter is you.

1199
00:52:18,468 --> 00:52:20,902
This is $20 million.

1200
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:23,439
Do you see this table?

1201
00:52:23,507 --> 00:52:25,702
This is Pupkin & Langford.

1202
00:52:25,775 --> 00:52:29,541
This is $800 million.

1203
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:31,581
This is your value to the company.

1204
00:52:33,183 --> 00:52:34,912
You're on probation.

1205
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:36,850
Any more problems, you're fired.

1206
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:38,046
Are we clear?

1207
00:52:38,121 --> 00:52:39,782
Yes, sir.

1208
00:52:41,925 --> 00:52:44,450
You know, Cooper,

1209
00:52:44,528 --> 00:52:47,088
you can lose a lot of money
chasing women,

1210
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:50,361
but you'll never lose women
chasing money.

1211
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:08,316
<i>I got lucky.</i>

1212
00:53:08,385 --> 00:53:11,218
<i>I still had my job,
I still had my family.</i>

1213
00:53:11,288 --> 00:53:13,415
<i>All I had to do
was one thing.</i>

1214
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:14,889
Nikki is on line one.

1215
00:53:14,958 --> 00:53:16,482
Tell her I'm not here.

1216
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:18,391
Sure.

1217
00:53:21,231 --> 00:53:22,823
Sorry, he's not in right now.

1218
00:53:35,478 --> 00:53:36,809
Nikki called twice.

1219
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,814
What should I tell her
if she calls again?

1220
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,406
Just tell her I'm not here.

1221
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:44,885
Way overboard.

1222
00:53:44,955 --> 00:53:46,786
I'm not offended, I just don't...

1223
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,653
Well, you know what?
You have to...

1224
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,249
Richard Cooper's office.

1225
00:53:50,327 --> 00:53:51,351
I'm not here.

1226
00:53:51,428 --> 00:53:52,690
He's not in the office right now.

1227
00:53:52,762 --> 00:53:53,786
Can I take a message?

1228
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:56,832
Well, can you let him know
that I called?

1229
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,130
Tell her I'm dead.

1230
00:53:59,202 --> 00:54:01,602
- Okay.
- Really dead.

1231
00:54:01,671 --> 00:54:02,638
Will do, Nikki.

1232
00:54:02,706 --> 00:54:03,638
Really dead.

1233
00:54:03,707 --> 00:54:04,605
Yes.

1234
00:54:45,882 --> 00:54:47,440
The Killers?

1235
00:54:47,517 --> 00:54:49,951
I always thought you were
more of a Wu-Tang guy.

1236
00:54:50,020 --> 00:54:51,214
Nelson?

1237
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,312
Get outta here!

1238
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:53,788
Long time, no see.

1239
00:54:53,857 --> 00:54:55,188
Yeah.

1240
00:54:55,258 --> 00:54:57,249
Same to you, Mr. Wall Street.

1241
00:54:57,327 --> 00:54:59,261
Are you still working
down at Pupkin & Langford?

1242
00:54:59,329 --> 00:55:00,796
Yeah, I-I think I'm still there.

1243
00:55:00,864 --> 00:55:02,092
We'll see how long that lasts.

1244
00:55:02,165 --> 00:55:03,598
- Hmm.
- So, what are you up to?

1245
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:05,532
Oh. Shit, nothing much.

1246
00:55:05,602 --> 00:55:07,433
Doing a little work
for the Legal Defense Fund.

1247
00:55:07,504 --> 00:55:08,596
It's going okay.

1248
00:55:08,672 --> 00:55:11,004
Figured I'd come in here
and pick up a few CDs.

1249
00:55:11,074 --> 00:55:12,564
Pretty soon, the only place
you'll be able

1250
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:14,200
to buy 'em is at Starbucks.

1251
00:55:14,277 --> 00:55:15,710
I know, and they don't
sell any rap at Starbucks.

1252
00:55:15,779 --> 00:55:18,407
I guess you want some rap, you
got to go to a liquor store.

1253
00:55:18,481 --> 00:55:21,416
Yeah, let me get a pint
of Jack and that Ja Rule.

1254
00:55:21,484 --> 00:55:24,351
Hey, guess who I saw
two weeks ago- Nikki.

1255
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:27,913
She said she bumped
into you or something, right?

1256
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:30,459
Yeah, yeah, yeah, she
came by the office.

1257
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:32,051
So, how was that for you?

1258
00:55:32,128 --> 00:55:34,119
I mean, you guys had
a pretty bad breakup.

1259
00:55:34,197 --> 00:55:36,529
No, no, it was actually kind
of cool to see her again.

1260
00:55:36,599 --> 00:55:38,066
I mean, if I'd ran into her

1261
00:55:38,134 --> 00:55:39,601
without my medication, who knows?

1262
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,796
But, uh... we talked for a minute.

1263
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:43,532
You know, caught up.

1264
00:55:43,606 --> 00:55:46,541
Got to tell you, Rich, man,
she still look good.

1265
00:55:46,609 --> 00:55:49,373
I mean, she's... that
... fine!

1266
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:51,311
She's... man, just
the way she's shaped...

1267
00:55:51,381 --> 00:55:53,542
I mean, you see her skin?!
Did you... you saw her.

1268
00:55:53,616 --> 00:55:55,675
I mean it ju-ju-just... smooth.

1269
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:58,653
I looked at her, I kept
watching her, next thing I know,

1270
00:55:58,722 --> 00:56:00,053
I'd been looking at her
for 20 minutes.

1271
00:56:00,123 --> 00:56:01,750
And I realized I was following
her, you know what I mean?

1272
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:03,122
I mean, it wasn't creepy
or nothing, you know.

1273
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:05,024
I didn't...
I don't think she saw me.

1274
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:07,222
And I'm just gonna,
you know, stay away.

1275
00:56:07,297 --> 00:56:08,662
I'm getting my life together.

1276
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:10,893
Anyway, if you see Nikki,
you tell her I said hello.

1277
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:13,800
Don't... no, don't...
don't do that. Don't.

1278
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:15,394
It's good to see you, Rich.

1279
00:56:22,912 --> 00:56:24,709
Hey, Richard, I have
some messages for you.

1280
00:56:30,653 --> 00:56:32,177
Did Nikki call?

1281
00:56:32,255 --> 00:56:33,745
No, she didn't.

1282
00:56:33,823 --> 00:56:36,724
I guess she finally got the hint.

1283
00:57:12,796 --> 00:57:15,128
Hey.

1284
00:57:15,198 --> 00:57:17,325
What are you doing here?

1285
00:57:17,400 --> 00:57:19,300
Can I ask you a question?

1286
00:57:19,369 --> 00:57:20,700
It's personal.

1287
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,260
Go right ahead.

1288
00:57:22,338 --> 00:57:24,101
Why are you still married?

1289
00:57:24,174 --> 00:57:26,802
I mean, you never really seemed
like the marrying type, and now

1290
00:57:26,876 --> 00:57:29,140
even though you say you're
happy, I don't think you are.

1291
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:31,646
I'm happy. I mean, wh-when
I got with Brenda,

1292
00:57:31,714 --> 00:57:32,942
I decided to settle down.

1293
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:35,211
I mean, she's a great
mother, and I love her.

1294
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:36,479
See? You don't say it right!

1295
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:38,077
We're gonna go through
this shit again.

1296
00:57:38,154 --> 00:57:39,485
How was I supposed to say it, Nikki?

1297
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:40,989
You're supposed to say
that you love her

1298
00:57:41,057 --> 00:57:42,217
and you can't live without her.

1299
00:57:42,292 --> 00:57:43,589
You just sound indebted.

1300
00:57:43,660 --> 00:57:45,560
You're not in love; you're in loyal.

1301
00:57:45,628 --> 00:57:47,220
Well, at least I'm in something.

1302
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,764
At-at least I have a family.

1303
00:57:48,832 --> 00:57:49,958
Wh-What do you have?

1304
00:57:50,033 --> 00:57:52,126
Oh, don't throw that
family shit at me.

1305
00:57:52,202 --> 00:57:54,568
You and your wife, you don't
talk, you don't fuck.

1306
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:57,435
If that's what family is, I'll wait.

1307
00:57:57,507 --> 00:57:59,168
For what, Nikki?
What are you waiting for?

1308
00:57:59,242 --> 00:58:01,233
For the real thing.

1309
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,142
Love.

1310
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:07,274
Or at least a sponsor,
but I'm not settling.

1311
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:10,478
You ever think about
getting a skill?

1312
00:58:10,553 --> 00:58:14,250
Oh, I got skills.

1313
00:58:14,324 --> 00:58:17,851
What are you doing here?

1314
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:23,227
I don't know, we're...
we're friends, right?

1315
00:58:24,701 --> 00:58:28,137
Yeah... We're friends.

1316
00:58:28,204 --> 00:58:31,173
Come on, I got to
get back to work.

1317
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:33,175
You should come out
with me tonight.

1318
00:58:33,243 --> 00:58:34,608
I'm not going out with you.

1319
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:35,701
I need you to.

1320
00:58:35,778 --> 00:58:37,040
What for?
What's going on?

1321
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:38,410
Well, there's this guy,
he's really into me.

1322
00:58:38,481 --> 00:58:39,607
I'm not sure what I
think about him,

1323
00:58:39,682 --> 00:58:41,775
so I want you to come and
tell me what you think.

1324
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:43,182
After D.C.,
I have no desire

1325
00:58:43,253 --> 00:58:44,686
to meet any more
of your boyfriends.

1326
00:58:44,754 --> 00:58:46,051
What, are you jealous?

1327
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:48,716
No. Okay, who's this guy?
What's his name?

1328
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:49,758
Compassion.

1329
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:51,157
Compassion?!

1330
00:58:51,227 --> 00:58:53,161
Wh-What?
Compassion Fruit?

1331
00:58:53,229 --> 00:58:54,924
Compassion... Luther King.

1332
00:58:54,998 --> 00:58:56,522
Compassionate?
Wh-Wh...?

1333
00:58:56,599 --> 00:58:57,725
Compassion.

1334
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,165
Just come, it'll be a blast.

1335
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:01,601
You know, we'll eat onion rings
till 4:00 in the morning.

1336
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:04,139
It'll be like old times.

1337
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,334
So, what am I gonna tell my wife?

1338
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:08,604
Um... I don't know.

1339
00:59:08,678 --> 00:59:12,614
Just... start a fight.

1340
00:59:12,682 --> 00:59:14,673
Chicken?!

1341
00:59:14,751 --> 00:59:17,618
Yes. What is wrong?

1342
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:18,813
Chicken again?

1343
00:59:18,888 --> 00:59:21,015
We have chicken every day-
I'm tired of chicken.

1344
00:59:21,090 --> 00:59:22,387
I thought you liked chicken.

1345
00:59:22,458 --> 00:59:24,221
I like it, but I don't
like it every day.

1346
00:59:24,294 --> 00:59:26,285
I mean, I feel like I got
feathers coming out my ass.

1347
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:27,829
All right, this
isn't about chicken,

1348
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:28,955
because I know you like chicken.

1349
00:59:29,032 --> 00:59:30,329
No, no, no, you know what?
You know what?

1350
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,458
You know what this is about?

1351
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:33,661
This is about all the other
animals out there

1352
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:35,636
that are dying to be
eaten that we don't eat!

1353
00:59:35,705 --> 00:59:37,138
Now, have you ever
heard of lamb chops?

1354
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:38,673
Have you ever heard of pork chops?

1355
00:59:38,741 --> 00:59:40,333
Can a nigga get a taco?!

1356
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,536
Are you crazy?

1357
00:59:41,611 --> 00:59:44,011
I'm losing my finger-lickin'
mind right now,

1358
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,604
eating all this chicken.

1359
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:47,775
I can't take it anymore.

1360
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:50,148
Chicken hawks don't eat
this much chicken.

1361
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:51,379
You know what? I'm gone.

1362
00:59:51,454 --> 00:59:52,716
I can't take it!
I can't take it!

1363
00:59:52,789 --> 00:59:53,813
Wh-Where you going?

1364
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:56,381
To get some duck!

1365
01:00:06,135 --> 01:00:08,603
<i>What the hell is
wrong with me?</i>

1366
01:00:08,671 --> 01:00:10,605
<i>How could I talk to Brenda
like that?</i>

1367
01:00:10,673 --> 01:00:12,402
<i>I- I'm losing my mind.</i>

1368
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:15,103
<i>I got to go home.
Okay, next stop,</i>

1369
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:16,509
<i>I'm getting off this train</i>

1370
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:18,308
<i>and I'm gonna go
home to Brenda.</i>

1371
01:00:18,381 --> 01:00:21,908
<i>That's what I'm gonna do.
I am going home.</i>

1372
01:00:22,151 --> 01:00:24,381
So, I just got off the phone
with Nikki, and, um...

1373
01:00:24,454 --> 01:00:25,785
she's running
just a little bit late,

1374
01:00:25,855 --> 01:00:27,413
but she said she is gonna be here.

1375
01:00:27,490 --> 01:00:28,616
Late? How late?

1376
01:00:28,691 --> 01:00:31,159
I'm not really sure,
but, uh, she told me

1377
01:00:31,227 --> 01:00:32,717
to take good care of you,
and I will.

1378
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:34,490
So don't worry about it;
she'll be here.

1379
01:00:34,564 --> 01:00:35,690
Excuse me.

1380
01:00:35,765 --> 01:00:37,528
So, sh-she's gonna be here, right?

1381
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:39,329
She's gonna be here.
Don't worry.

1382
01:00:52,382 --> 01:00:54,043
Hi. Um...

1383
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:55,709
I'll have two vodka martinis.

1384
01:00:55,785 --> 01:00:57,275
Olive?

1385
01:00:57,353 --> 01:00:58,684
Yeah...

1386
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:05,418
Chicken?

1387
01:01:05,495 --> 01:01:07,520
Chicken, my ass.

1388
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:21,303
Excuse me...

1389
01:01:21,377 --> 01:01:23,106
Have you seen Nikki?!

1390
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:24,806
No, she hasn't called, but she will.

1391
01:01:24,881 --> 01:01:26,576
Dance! There's a lot of girls here.

1392
01:01:26,649 --> 01:01:27,775
Can I talk to you...?

1393
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:30,045
Fuck this!

1394
01:01:32,188 --> 01:01:33,780
Where is it?

1395
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:37,150
Boring-ass suit.

1396
01:01:37,226 --> 01:01:39,126
"I just wanted something different... "

1397
01:01:39,195 --> 01:01:41,220
with your green shirt!

1398
01:01:54,210 --> 01:01:56,269
Motherfucker!

1399
01:01:56,345 --> 01:01:57,937
Asian women.

1400
01:01:58,014 --> 01:02:00,778
I thought he was done
with that bullshit.

1401
01:02:03,486 --> 01:02:05,977
Did you wear it yet?

1402
01:02:06,055 --> 01:02:07,079
Excuse me?

1403
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:08,589
The shirt!

1404
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:10,888
I sold you a shirt
like, a month ago.

1405
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:11,892
Saks?

1406
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:13,428
We work at the men's
section in Saks.

1407
01:02:13,496 --> 01:02:14,793
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I remember you guys.

1408
01:02:14,864 --> 01:02:16,456
You-You sold me the green shirt.

1409
01:02:16,532 --> 01:02:18,261
Uh, what are you doing here?

1410
01:02:18,334 --> 01:02:20,768
We're just hanging out.
We come here every week.

1411
01:02:20,837 --> 01:02:22,702
Wednesday's the best night.
What are you doing here?

1412
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:24,706
Uh, I'm-I'm waiting for someone.

1413
01:02:24,774 --> 01:02:26,401
Okay, well, we're
gonna go smoke this.

1414
01:02:26,476 --> 01:02:27,636
You wanna come?

1415
01:02:27,710 --> 01:02:29,974
Uh, I really shouldn't.
I shouldn't.

1416
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:31,570
Come on!

1417
01:02:31,647 --> 01:02:33,979
It's totally natural. I got it
from, like, this doctor I know.

1418
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:36,610
All right, but just a little bit.

1419
01:02:36,686 --> 01:02:38,347
- Come on.
- Come on.

1420
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:40,855
Well, what kind of chicken
did you cook him?

1421
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,153
He was just supposed to go out
to get something to eat,

1422
01:02:43,226 --> 01:02:44,488
and that was almost four hours ago.

1423
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,152
Did you go through his pockets?

1424
01:02:46,229 --> 01:02:48,356
Y- Yes, I checked his pockets.

1425
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:51,332
Did you find anything
on his computer?

1426
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,800
Just a little Asian porn,
but nothing serious.

1427
01:02:53,870 --> 01:02:58,068
I'm sure he's somewhere right
now, just clearing his head.

1428
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:06,281
I called him.

1429
01:03:06,349 --> 01:03:07,907
A- And he hasn't answered.

1430
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:12,421
<i>Richard is a responsible guy.</i>

1431
01:03:12,488 --> 01:03:14,820
I'm sure you don't have anything
to worry about.

1432
01:03:20,897 --> 01:03:23,331
Okay, yeah.

1433
01:03:23,399 --> 01:03:24,730
You're probably right.

1434
01:03:36,412 --> 01:03:37,470
Have you heard from Nikki?!

1435
01:03:37,547 --> 01:03:39,174
I just got off the phone with her.

1436
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:40,681
She told me to tell you
she's sorry

1437
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,513
but she's not gonna
be able to make it.

1438
01:03:42,585 --> 01:03:45,315
She's going to Miami with
some guy named Compassion.

1439
01:03:45,388 --> 01:03:48,221
Something about
Puffy having a party.

1440
01:04:29,298 --> 01:04:31,425
Where have you been?

1441
01:04:33,336 --> 01:04:34,268
I'm sorry.

1442
01:04:34,337 --> 01:04:35,599
Fuck "sorry. "

1443
01:04:35,671 --> 01:04:38,299
What kind of "food"
did you go out to get

1444
01:04:38,374 --> 01:04:39,932
that takes five goddamn hours?

1445
01:04:40,009 --> 01:04:41,306
Brenda...

1446
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:44,904
Brenda shit!
Don't you say my name.

1447
01:04:44,981 --> 01:04:46,744
Are you fucking somebody?

1448
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:49,683
'Cause I swear to God, if I find
out you're fucking somebody...

1449
01:04:49,752 --> 01:04:51,686
It's not that; it's work. I...

1450
01:04:51,754 --> 01:04:54,222
I lost a client, and
they put me on probation.

1451
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:57,157
Now I wanted to tell you, but I
didn't want you to get upset.

1452
01:04:57,226 --> 01:04:58,818
Where have you been?

1453
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:00,522
I was at the sports bar,
watching the Knick game.

1454
01:05:00,596 --> 01:05:02,120
The game has been over.

1455
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:04,257
I know.

1456
01:05:04,333 --> 01:05:08,235
Don't you ever do any shit
like this to me again.

1457
01:05:08,304 --> 01:05:09,771
Do you hear me?

1458
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:16,735
I don't know what's going on
with you, but you fix it.

1459
01:05:20,783 --> 01:05:22,341
I'm sorry.

1460
01:05:22,418 --> 01:05:24,545
You should be.

1461
01:05:33,262 --> 01:05:34,627
Hi, this is Nikki.

1462
01:05:34,697 --> 01:05:36,824
I'm not here to take your call,
so remember:

1463
01:05:36,899 --> 01:05:40,528
Love is God, God is love. Peace.

1464
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:45,699
Nikki? Richard.

1465
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:48,209
I don't know what happened
to you last night,

1466
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:51,178
and I don't really care.

1467
01:05:51,247 --> 01:05:55,081
I'm married. You're single.

1468
01:05:55,151 --> 01:05:57,949
Don't call me.
Don't come by the office.

1469
01:05:58,020 --> 01:06:00,386
Don't e-mail me. Don't fax me.

1470
01:06:00,456 --> 01:06:04,324
Just leave me the fuck alone.

1471
01:06:04,393 --> 01:06:05,519
You got it?

1472
01:06:05,594 --> 01:06:10,429
Just leave me the fuck alone.

1473
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:12,194
Thank you.

1474
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:17,697
Good night.

1475
01:06:17,773 --> 01:06:19,365
Good night, Richard.

1476
01:06:20,409 --> 01:06:21,740
Go home, Tracy.

1477
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,176
Good night, Richard.

1478
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:26,742
Uh, Cliff, tell Russell
I can do the late lunch,

1479
01:06:26,816 --> 01:06:28,408
and then we'll talk
about that other thing.

1480
01:06:28,484 --> 01:06:29,416
Okay.

1481
01:06:29,485 --> 01:06:32,181
Want a ride?

1482
01:06:32,254 --> 01:06:33,221
Yeah, sure.

1483
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:34,551
Come on.

1484
01:06:38,794 --> 01:06:40,762
So, what are you gonna do?

1485
01:06:40,830 --> 01:06:42,024
I don't know.

1486
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:44,191
Brenda's so fucking mad, I'm scared.

1487
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:46,564
All right, buddy,
now is damage control.

1488
01:06:46,635 --> 01:06:47,829
I'll tell you what to do.

1489
01:06:47,903 --> 01:06:49,336
This weekend, you
get a babysitter,

1490
01:06:49,405 --> 01:06:51,066
take your wife out to a nice dinner.

1491
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,471
- Okay.
- Right?

1492
01:06:52,541 --> 01:06:55,874
See a bullshit chick flick,
whatever she wants, and you take

1493
01:06:55,945 --> 01:06:59,813
one of these and you fuck your
wife like you're a porn star.

1494
01:06:59,882 --> 01:07:02,442
You keep Viagra in
the glove compartment?

1495
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:05,419
Yeah, right next to the Altoids.

1496
01:07:05,488 --> 01:07:09,049
I may not look like Brad Pitt,
but I can fuck like him.

1497
01:07:09,125 --> 01:07:12,151
Seriously, take this.

1498
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:14,458
Show Brenda a good time.

1499
01:07:14,530 --> 01:07:16,930
And stay away from Nikki.

1500
01:07:16,999 --> 01:07:19,524
You got a good wife.

1501
01:07:20,603 --> 01:07:22,400
What are you doing?

1502
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:26,238
I got a date with the
intern from the third floor.

1503
01:07:26,308 --> 01:07:27,332
Goddamn!

1504
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:28,775
She's 23.

1505
01:07:28,844 --> 01:07:31,369
Might need to take two.

1506
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:35,540
And you're happily married?

1507
01:07:35,618 --> 01:07:37,711
17 years.

1508
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:38,981
Good night.

1509
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:40,044
All right.

1510
01:07:46,495 --> 01:07:49,293
<i>I'm gonna take
George's advice.</i>

1511
01:07:49,365 --> 01:07:54,325
<i>Because even though he cheats
on his wife and pops pills,</i>

1512
01:07:54,403 --> 01:07:59,238
<i>unlike our therapist,
he's married.</i>

1513
01:08:05,347 --> 01:08:06,439
That was incredible.

1514
01:08:06,515 --> 01:08:08,983
I know. Fantastic.

1515
01:08:09,051 --> 01:08:10,746
Next time, we got to take the kids.

1516
01:08:10,820 --> 01:08:12,481
Absolutely; they'd love it.

1517
01:08:12,555 --> 01:08:14,045
How long you think she's been out?

1518
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:15,590
Hours.

1519
01:08:15,658 --> 01:08:18,092
You know, sometimes I
think they put her to bed.

1520
01:08:18,160 --> 01:08:19,286
Probably. Yeah.

1521
01:08:19,361 --> 01:08:21,056
Look, I'm gonna go
check on the kids.

1522
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:23,030
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
I'll check on the kids.

1523
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:25,829
I'll get rid of Rebecca,
then I'll see you upstairs.

1524
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:28,096
Okay.

1525
01:08:38,881 --> 01:08:41,577
Gotta go.

1526
01:08:41,650 --> 01:08:43,413
Wow, when'd you get back?

1527
01:08:43,486 --> 01:08:44,680
Just got back.
Gotta go.

1528
01:08:44,753 --> 01:08:46,653
Oh, the kids were
really great today.

1529
01:08:46,722 --> 01:08:48,246
I'm sure they are.
Gotta go.

1530
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:49,848
They all went to bed about 8:30.

1531
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:50,857
8:30! Gotta go!

1532
01:08:50,926 --> 01:08:51,950
It was really cute.

1533
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:53,494
They came up with this little song.

1534
01:08:53,562 --> 01:08:55,826
All right.
"The Gotta Go Song. "

1535
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:57,195
Gotta go, gotta go, gotta go.

1536
01:09:08,844 --> 01:09:10,505
Daddy loves you.

1537
01:09:25,294 --> 01:09:26,784
Ooh!

1538
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:05,826
George, we got a problem.

1539
01:10:05,901 --> 01:10:08,461
It better be a problem.
It's 3:00 in the morning.

1540
01:10:08,537 --> 01:10:10,732
Hey, I took that Viagra pill
you gave me,

1541
01:10:10,806 --> 01:10:12,740
<i>took it around 11:00,
and I'm still hard!</i>

1542
01:10:12,808 --> 01:10:14,036
Yeah, so what's the problem?

1543
01:10:14,109 --> 01:10:15,701
I'm still hard, George.

1544
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:17,245
I've been hard for four hours.

1545
01:10:17,313 --> 01:10:18,610
This thing won't go down!

1546
01:10:18,681 --> 01:10:20,012
Well, did you relieve yourself?

1547
01:10:20,082 --> 01:10:21,413
Did I relieve myself?!

1548
01:10:21,483 --> 01:10:23,178
Yes, I've come,
like, three times,

1549
01:10:23,252 --> 01:10:25,914
and I'm still hard, and
it's all because of you!

1550
01:10:25,988 --> 01:10:27,649
Who the hell are you talking to?

1551
01:10:30,259 --> 01:10:32,727
Are you talking
to some little bitch?!

1552
01:10:32,795 --> 01:10:35,093
Are you... are-are you talking
to some whore in my house?

1553
01:10:35,164 --> 01:10:37,826
No, no, no, it's
George, it's George.

1554
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,026
George?!

1555
01:10:39,101 --> 01:10:41,501
What kind of down-low shit is that?

1556
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,834
Look, George, I gotta go.
Uh, it's not what you think.

1557
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:44,838
Oh...

1558
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:46,101
I did this all for you.

1559
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:47,369
Oh, for me?

1560
01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:49,240
I wanted to have great sex
with you,

1561
01:10:49,311 --> 01:10:51,006
so I got a Viagra pill
from George,

1562
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:52,513
and I came upstairs,

1563
01:10:52,581 --> 01:10:54,173
and you were sound asleep.

1564
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:56,047
And I've just been hard
for, like, four hours.

1565
01:10:56,118 --> 01:10:57,346
You've been hard for four hours?

1566
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:59,114
Honey, you gotta help...
you gotta, you gotta, you go...

1567
01:10:59,188 --> 01:11:00,951
Don't... Keep that
thing away from me.

1568
01:11:03,659 --> 01:11:04,591
What are you doing?

1569
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:06,025
You know what that
commercial says.

1570
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:07,892
Well, i-if you've taken a Viagra
and you've had an erection

1571
01:11:07,963 --> 01:11:09,828
for longer than four hours,
then you call a physician.

1572
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:11,058
I'm calling Dr. Caruthers.

1573
01:11:11,133 --> 01:11:12,828
It's 3:00 in the morning.

1574
01:11:12,901 --> 01:11:14,459
I know, and he's...
and he's not in.

1575
01:11:14,536 --> 01:11:16,504
Okay, so-so what are we gonna do?

1576
01:11:20,909 --> 01:11:22,934
Okay, about how much longer
before we get to the hospital?

1577
01:11:23,012 --> 01:11:24,274
About 15 minutes, sir.

1578
01:11:24,346 --> 01:11:26,109
Are you sure you only took one?

1579
01:11:26,181 --> 01:11:29,514
Honey, honey, if you took more
than one, just say something.

1580
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:31,746
I- I just took one, okay?
That's it!

1581
01:11:31,820 --> 01:11:33,481
No, this ice isn't working.

1582
01:11:33,555 --> 01:11:35,921
Wh-What do you mean,
the ice isn't working?!

1583
01:11:35,991 --> 01:11:39,085
How's your eyesight?
Is it clear? Is it blurry?

1584
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:40,423
Uh... it's a little blurry.

1585
01:11:40,496 --> 01:11:43,158
It's a little blurry.
Wh-What's that mean?

1586
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:45,757
Could mean nothing, or it
could mean you're going blind.

1587
01:11:45,834 --> 01:11:49,167
You're suffering from severe priapism.
I don't think we have time to wait.

1588
01:11:49,238 --> 01:11:51,229
I'm gonna have to do
something about this now.

1589
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:52,569
What's going on?!

1590
01:11:52,641 --> 01:11:54,939
I'm going to have to perform
a therapeutic aspiration.

1591
01:11:55,010 --> 01:11:56,671
Oh, my God.
You-You sure?

1592
01:11:56,745 --> 01:11:58,610
A- A-A th-thera what?!

1593
01:11:58,681 --> 01:11:59,909
Therapeutic aspiration.

1594
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:03,008
I'm gonna stick this needle
into the side of your penis

1595
01:12:03,085 --> 01:12:05,019
and draw blood directly
from the cavernosa.

1596
01:12:05,087 --> 01:12:06,554
Get the fuck out of here!

1597
01:12:06,622 --> 01:12:08,419
- Shh!
- I promise you, it won't hurt.

1598
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:09,855
- You'll just feel a pinch.
- Brenda, Brenda!

1599
01:12:09,925 --> 01:12:10,892
Hold him down.

1600
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:12,085
Oh... no, no!

1601
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:13,719
No, no!

1602
01:12:13,796 --> 01:12:14,785
- Yes! Yes!
- No, no, no.

1603
01:12:14,863 --> 01:12:15,955
It's not gonna hurt.
Don't worry about it.

1604
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:16,963
Pull over, pull over.

1605
01:12:17,032 --> 01:12:18,932
No, no!

1606
01:12:19,001 --> 01:12:20,866
No!

1607
01:12:29,745 --> 01:12:31,406
<i>After all my drama,</i>

1608
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:34,278
<i>looking at other women
just made me mad.</i>

1609
01:12:35,918 --> 01:12:37,476
<i>Look at her.</i>

1610
01:12:37,553 --> 01:12:39,783
<i>She should do that
shit at home.</i>

1611
01:12:39,855 --> 01:12:41,152
<i>Fuckin' skank.</i>

1612
01:12:42,458 --> 01:12:44,449
<i>And look at this one-</i>

1613
01:12:44,526 --> 01:12:46,084
<i>send an e-mail, slut.</i>

1614
01:12:46,161 --> 01:12:48,493
<i>Nobody wants to talk to you.</i>

1615
01:12:49,998 --> 01:12:52,159
<i>And look at this one.</i>

1616
01:12:52,234 --> 01:12:53,565
<i>Okay, I'm not mad at her.</i>

1617
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:55,432
<i>I mean, who could
be mad at her?</i>

1618
01:12:55,504 --> 01:12:57,096
<i>But I'm not gonna look.</i>

1619
01:12:57,172 --> 01:12:59,902
<i>I'm gonna just
keep on going</i>

1620
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:02,205
<i>'cause I am done
making stupid mistakes.</i>

1621
01:13:02,277 --> 01:13:05,041
<i>From now on,
it's family first.</i>

1622
01:13:43,786 --> 01:13:45,344
<i>All right, we're gonna start
with these accounts</i>

1623
01:13:45,421 --> 01:13:47,480
and then work our way
to the new ones.

1624
01:13:47,556 --> 01:13:50,081
You better order in, 'cause
we got a lot of work to do.

1625
01:13:53,128 --> 01:13:55,062
Miss me?

1626
01:13:55,130 --> 01:13:56,825
<i>If she had called,</i>

1627
01:13:56,899 --> 01:13:59,299
<i>I could have hung up on her,
no problem.</i>

1628
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:02,633
<i>But seeing her in person
so close, I was defenseless.</i>

1629
01:14:04,606 --> 01:14:08,235
<i>I have a fianc now.</i>

1630
01:14:08,310 --> 01:14:09,538
Sean.

1631
01:14:10,712 --> 01:14:12,304
Get out of here.

1632
01:14:12,381 --> 01:14:13,348
You're getting married?

1633
01:14:13,415 --> 01:14:14,677
Yeah.

1634
01:14:14,750 --> 01:14:17,014
Nikki Tru is walking
down the aisle?

1635
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:19,053
I'm closing the deal.

1636
01:14:19,121 --> 01:14:20,884
Sean is in real estate.

1637
01:14:20,956 --> 01:14:21,980
What happened?

1638
01:14:22,057 --> 01:14:23,991
Uh...

1639
01:14:24,059 --> 01:14:25,390
I was at this party.

1640
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:27,088
I was talking to this guy-

1641
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:28,652
I don't even remember
what we were talking about-

1642
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:31,426
and... this little

1643
01:14:31,500 --> 01:14:34,196
22-year-old girl walks by.

1644
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:36,863
And he was like,
"Oh, excuse me, I got to... "

1645
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:41,240
Then it hit me.

1646
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,642
You know, I'm 32 years old.

1647
01:14:43,712 --> 01:14:45,680
I'm the old bitch at the club now.

1648
01:14:45,747 --> 01:14:47,442
Think it was

1649
01:14:47,516 --> 01:14:49,507
the first time in my life
I was talking to a man

1650
01:14:49,585 --> 01:14:51,576
who wasn't even thinking
about fucking me.

1651
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:56,855
So, then I met Sean.

1652
01:14:56,925 --> 01:15:00,691
And I said to myself,
I got to make this work.

1653
01:15:00,762 --> 01:15:02,525
So we're getting married in June.

1654
01:15:02,598 --> 01:15:03,929
And I want you to meet him.

1655
01:15:03,999 --> 01:15:05,466
Wow.

1656
01:15:05,534 --> 01:15:06,660
Let me get this.

1657
01:15:06,735 --> 01:15:08,430
You always get it.

1658
01:15:08,504 --> 01:15:09,801
You sure?

1659
01:15:09,872 --> 01:15:12,432
Yeah, I'm sure.

1660
01:15:18,947 --> 01:15:21,177
Ah! Almost got you!

1661
01:15:21,250 --> 01:15:22,774
Daddy's gonna get you.

1662
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:24,478
- Hey.
- Hey.

1663
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:25,485
How was work?

1664
01:15:25,554 --> 01:15:27,283
Pretty good.
Uh, remember Nikki?

1665
01:15:27,356 --> 01:15:28,516
She-she came by today.

1666
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:29,887
Uh-huh. Yeah.

1667
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:32,188
Yeah, she's getting
married to some guy.

1668
01:15:32,261 --> 01:15:33,558
Great.

1669
01:15:33,629 --> 01:15:34,789
Yeah, I hope he has insurance.

1670
01:15:35,964 --> 01:15:37,363
Uh, Rebecca
and Brian

1671
01:15:37,432 --> 01:15:39,161
- are waiting for you.
- Thank you.

1672
01:15:39,234 --> 01:15:41,794
I'm gonna get Kelly.

1673
01:15:57,085 --> 01:15:58,484
<i>Yeah, I am so glad</i>

1674
01:15:58,554 --> 01:16:00,545
you two are making such progress.

1675
01:16:00,622 --> 01:16:02,351
I wasn't sure we'd make it this far.

1676
01:16:02,424 --> 01:16:04,255
Yeah, I just decided
to stop complaining

1677
01:16:04,326 --> 01:16:05,884
about all the things
I didn't have

1678
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:08,521
and start appreciating
the things I did.

1679
01:16:08,597 --> 01:16:10,428
That is what I want
to hear from both of you:

1680
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:14,265
getting along
and appreciating what you have.

1681
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:15,860
So, how are things physically?

1682
01:16:16,939 --> 01:16:18,873
Oh, well, um,

1683
01:16:18,941 --> 01:16:22,308
well, well, we're not
quite having sex yet.

1684
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:24,607
Um, but-but, hey, we
are getting along,

1685
01:16:24,680 --> 01:16:28,116
and-and it's not all
about sex, right?

1686
01:16:28,183 --> 01:16:30,617
Yeah, I-I, I'm not complaining.

1687
01:16:30,686 --> 01:16:32,381
Uh, I'm just trying
to appreciate

1688
01:16:32,454 --> 01:16:35,651
the non-sex that we're having.

1689
01:16:35,724 --> 01:16:37,624
You know, you don't
have to have sex

1690
01:16:37,693 --> 01:16:39,684
to show somebody you love them.

1691
01:16:39,761 --> 01:16:42,229
I see.

1692
01:16:43,265 --> 01:16:45,130
What you writing?

1693
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:47,725
Oh, nothing.

1694
01:17:01,550 --> 01:17:04,986
Guys, I am so sorry I'm late.

1695
01:17:05,053 --> 01:17:06,315
Something came up at the office.

1696
01:17:06,388 --> 01:17:07,355
Not a problem.

1697
01:17:07,422 --> 01:17:08,980
Richard, this is Sean.

1698
01:17:09,057 --> 01:17:10,251
Sean, Richard.

1699
01:17:10,325 --> 01:17:12,122
Nikki tells me you work
at Pupkin & Langford.

1700
01:17:12,194 --> 01:17:13,559
Do you know Matt Landis?

1701
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:14,653
Yeah, that's my boss.

1702
01:17:14,730 --> 01:17:16,129
Ah! I feel sorry for you.

1703
01:17:17,299 --> 01:17:18,527
Well, next time
you see him,

1704
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:20,397
- tell him Sean Waters said hello.
- Yeah.

1705
01:17:20,469 --> 01:17:21,766
I wish you would've
shown up earlier.

1706
01:17:21,837 --> 01:17:24,067
You know, I have to go and
take care of a few things.

1707
01:17:25,807 --> 01:17:27,502
Will you call me when you're done?

1708
01:17:27,576 --> 01:17:28,736
- Yes.
- Okay.

1709
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:31,142
Don't forget: Nobu at 9:00.

1710
01:17:31,213 --> 01:17:32,441
- Mm-hmm.
- Don't be late.

1711
01:17:32,514 --> 01:17:34,505
I won't be.

1712
01:17:36,752 --> 01:17:38,845
Richard, next time
you're in Malibu, look us up.

1713
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:40,717
Bring your wife;
we'll all go out to dinner.

1714
01:17:40,789 --> 01:17:44,247
Oh, that's a great idea, babe.

1715
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:47,295
This is what you want?

1716
01:17:47,362 --> 01:17:49,330
You're getting married.

1717
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:52,424
Do you love him?

1718
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,230
Do I love him?

1719
01:17:55,303 --> 01:17:57,863
In a few years, maybe.

1720
01:17:57,939 --> 01:17:59,236
I'm gonna be like you.

1721
01:17:59,307 --> 01:18:00,899
You know, I'm gonna have
a nice house,

1722
01:18:00,976 --> 01:18:04,036
a nice husband,
couple kids-

1723
01:18:04,112 --> 01:18:07,309
a nice, easy, dull, boring life.

1724
01:18:07,382 --> 01:18:08,974
And I will never again
have to live

1725
01:18:09,051 --> 01:18:10,916
in a tiny-ass studio apartment.

1726
01:18:10,986 --> 01:18:12,886
Come on.
Don't-don't hurt the guy.

1727
01:18:12,954 --> 01:18:15,855
What do you care?

1728
01:18:15,924 --> 01:18:17,721
You hurt?

1729
01:18:17,793 --> 01:18:19,556
Don't go there.

1730
01:18:19,628 --> 01:18:21,562
You started it.

1731
01:18:21,630 --> 01:18:23,257
Do I love him?

1732
01:18:24,666 --> 01:18:26,896
You know, we could be
really happy together,

1733
01:18:26,968 --> 01:18:29,994
you and me.

1734
01:18:30,072 --> 01:18:31,937
Don't you want to be happy?

1735
01:18:32,007 --> 01:18:34,601
My life's not about

1736
01:18:34,676 --> 01:18:36,507
what... I want.

1737
01:18:36,578 --> 01:18:40,378
I hear ice cracking.

1738
01:18:40,449 --> 01:18:42,440
Careful not to drown, Richie.

1739
01:18:48,256 --> 01:18:51,123
So, Sean leaves for
L.A. in the morning.

1740
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:53,787
I don't leave till Wednesday.

1741
01:18:53,862 --> 01:18:55,227
So why don't you
come by tomorrow

1742
01:18:55,297 --> 01:18:57,231
and we can have a proper good-bye?

1743
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:02,568
Y- You know, Nikki, I'm-I'm not sure.

1744
01:19:02,637 --> 01:19:04,366
I will call you
with the address,

1745
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:06,669
and I will see you at 2:00.

1746
01:19:21,590 --> 01:19:23,888
Richard?

1747
01:19:23,959 --> 01:19:25,688
Baby, you up?

1748
01:19:25,761 --> 01:19:27,729
Hmm?

1749
01:19:27,929 --> 01:19:29,920
<i>When I woke up this morning,</i>

1750
01:19:29,998 --> 01:19:32,694
<i>I had no idea
what I was going to do.</i>

1751
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:34,929
<i>You know, some people say
life is short</i>

1752
01:19:35,003 --> 01:19:37,403
<i>and that you could get hit
by a bus at any moment</i>

1753
01:19:37,472 --> 01:19:40,908
<i>and that you have to live
each day like it's your last.</i>

1754
01:19:40,976 --> 01:19:42,273
<i>Bullshit.</i>

1755
01:19:42,344 --> 01:19:43,709
<i>Life is long.</i>

1756
01:19:43,779 --> 01:19:46,339
<i>You're probably not
gonna get hit by a bus,</i>

1757
01:19:46,414 --> 01:19:47,813
<i>and you're gonna have to live</i>

1758
01:19:47,883 --> 01:19:50,875
<i>with the choices you make
for the next 50 years.</i>

1759
01:19:52,888 --> 01:19:54,753
You know, their numbers
were pretty good last year.

1760
01:19:54,823 --> 01:19:56,415
I always thought
that was a good buy.

1761
01:19:56,491 --> 01:19:58,152
But that's just me.

1762
01:19:58,226 --> 01:20:00,717
Sure, we could buy every day.

1763
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:02,229
Uh, Lowenstein at Poco.

1764
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:04,788
He speaks Japanese, and he's gay.

1765
01:20:04,866 --> 01:20:07,266
I only say that 'cause I took
him to Scores last Tuesday,

1766
01:20:07,335 --> 01:20:08,927
disaster, all right?

1767
01:20:09,004 --> 01:20:10,562
See what you can do.

1768
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:13,301
Uh, all right, big guy wants us
all to concentrate on EuroTech.

1769
01:20:13,375 --> 01:20:16,538
And nobody talks to them
except me and Richard.

1770
01:20:16,611 --> 01:20:17,578
You got it.

1771
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:19,580
All right.

1772
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:23,210
<i>When two people admit</i>

1773
01:20:23,285 --> 01:20:25,446
<i>that they're attracted
to each other,</i>

1774
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,284
<i>they're no longer in control.</i>

1775
01:20:28,356 --> 01:20:31,382
<i>The relationship
has to play itself out,</i>

1776
01:20:31,459 --> 01:20:34,019
<i>for better or for worse.</i>

1777
01:20:36,031 --> 01:20:37,430
Where's he going?

1778
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:39,524
Lunch, Tracy.

1779
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:57,284
Thank you.

1780
01:20:59,287 --> 01:21:01,278
Uh, excuse me...

1781
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:04,985
Uh-huh?

1782
01:21:06,995 --> 01:21:09,088
Do you have any condoms?

1783
01:21:09,164 --> 01:21:10,631
Sorry, I didn't hear what you said.

1784
01:21:11,700 --> 01:21:13,463
Condoms.

1785
01:21:13,535 --> 01:21:14,968
Oh, condoms! Sure.

1786
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:16,298
What kind you want?

1787
01:21:16,371 --> 01:21:18,168
Quiet ones.

1788
01:21:18,240 --> 01:21:20,640
Let me just get the blue.

1789
01:21:20,709 --> 01:21:22,506
Three-pack or 12-pack?

1790
01:21:22,577 --> 01:21:24,135
Three.

1791
01:21:24,212 --> 01:21:25,907
12-pack is cheaper.

1792
01:21:25,981 --> 01:21:27,073
Look...

1793
01:21:27,148 --> 01:21:29,275
can you just get me
some fucking condoms?

1794
01:21:31,353 --> 01:21:33,480
I don't have change of a $20.

1795
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:34,522
Hey, Bob!

1796
01:21:34,589 --> 01:21:36,284
You have change of a $20?

1797
01:21:36,358 --> 01:21:37,985
You got to have change of a $20.

1798
01:21:38,059 --> 01:21:39,686
Bob, the man needs his condoms!

1799
01:21:39,761 --> 01:21:41,058
You know what?
Just keep it.

1800
01:21:41,129 --> 01:21:42,061
- Well...
- Just keep it.

1801
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:43,097
Well...

1802
01:22:12,227 --> 01:22:13,558
Nikki?

1803
01:22:13,628 --> 01:22:15,619
I'm in here.

1804
01:22:21,569 --> 01:22:24,333
You're here.

1805
01:22:24,406 --> 01:22:27,341
I thought you might get scared
and not show up.

1806
01:22:27,409 --> 01:22:29,400
Scared?

1807
01:22:31,413 --> 01:22:32,471
Scared of what?

1808
01:22:32,547 --> 01:22:34,811
I don't know.

1809
01:22:34,883 --> 01:22:37,317
Just scared.

1810
01:22:37,385 --> 01:22:40,115
You want to help me with this?

1811
01:22:40,188 --> 01:22:41,177
Yeah, yeah, sure.

1812
01:22:41,256 --> 01:22:43,247
Sure, I'll help you.

1813
01:22:46,661 --> 01:22:47,821
Ooh, ooh. Sorry.

1814
01:22:47,896 --> 01:22:51,388
It's all right, just...

1815
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:54,458
It's okay.
It's okay.

1816
01:22:54,536 --> 01:22:56,128
Okay.

1817
01:23:00,075 --> 01:23:02,009
Just got here and you're
putting me to work.

1818
01:23:10,952 --> 01:23:13,614
I think... I got it.

1819
01:23:15,623 --> 01:23:16,612
No.

1820
01:23:16,691 --> 01:23:18,158
Not yet.

1821
01:23:18,226 --> 01:23:19,921
But you will.

1822
01:23:21,930 --> 01:23:23,420
You like my shoes?

1823
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:26,899
You're wearing shoes?

1824
01:23:26,968 --> 01:23:29,061
Yeah, I like them.

1825
01:23:29,137 --> 01:23:32,368
You mind if I keep them on?

1826
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,635
Go right ahead.

1827
01:23:43,051 --> 01:23:45,281
What are you doing
all the way over there?

1828
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:47,218
Thought you weren't scared.

1829
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:49,279
I'm just taking it all in.

1830
01:23:51,826 --> 01:23:53,384
You look real good, Nikki.

1831
01:23:53,461 --> 01:23:56,988
Why don't you take it all in
a little closer?

1832
01:23:57,065 --> 01:23:59,625
I'm not gonna bite.

1833
01:24:07,242 --> 01:24:08,766
I'm gonna miss you.

1834
01:24:11,679 --> 01:24:12,805
Gonna miss you, too.

1835
01:24:16,084 --> 01:24:18,814
So what are you waiting for?

1836
01:24:49,184 --> 01:24:50,776
Wait, wait, wait.

1837
01:24:50,852 --> 01:24:53,821
Take your clothes off.

1838
01:25:11,139 --> 01:25:12,663
What?

1839
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:15,576
What?

1840
01:25:20,315 --> 01:25:21,907
Richard?

1841
01:25:27,555 --> 01:25:28,487
What?

1842
01:25:28,556 --> 01:25:29,750
No, it's okay.

1843
01:25:29,824 --> 01:25:30,756
Sweetheart, it's okay.

1844
01:25:30,825 --> 01:25:31,985
S... What are you...?

1845
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:32,992
Richard, stop it!

1846
01:25:33,061 --> 01:25:34,688
No, St... What are you doing?!

1847
01:25:36,764 --> 01:25:39,324
Richard! Richard!

1848
01:25:39,400 --> 01:25:43,029
<i>Life is about choice.</i>

1849
01:25:43,104 --> 01:25:44,969
<i>We're all the sum
of our choices.</i>

1850
01:25:45,039 --> 01:25:47,405
<i>And most of them
are made for us.</i>

1851
01:25:47,475 --> 01:25:50,205
<i>You can't choose
when you're born.</i>

1852
01:25:50,278 --> 01:25:52,269
<i>You can't choose
where you're born.</i>

1853
01:25:52,347 --> 01:25:55,077
<i>You can't choose
your family.</i>

1854
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:57,618
<i>You can't even
choose who you love.</i>

1855
01:25:57,685 --> 01:26:00,677
<i>But you can choose
how you love.</i>

1856
01:26:25,580 --> 01:26:26,774
Richard.

1857
01:26:26,848 --> 01:26:27,872
Are you okay?

1858
01:26:27,949 --> 01:26:29,541
Yeah, yeah, I-I'm fine.

1859
01:26:29,617 --> 01:26:31,414
Oh, honey, what are you
doing home so early?

1860
01:26:31,486 --> 01:26:32,578
Where are the kids?

1861
01:26:32,654 --> 01:26:34,884
I just dropped them off
at my mother's house.

1862
01:26:34,956 --> 01:26:36,389
Hey, you're scaring me.

1863
01:26:36,457 --> 01:26:38,948
What... What's going on?

1864
01:26:39,027 --> 01:26:41,495
I missed you.

1865
01:26:41,563 --> 01:26:44,259
I miss you, too.

1866
01:26:44,332 --> 01:26:45,663
What's happening to us?

1867
01:26:45,733 --> 01:26:48,600
I don't know.

1868
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:49,830
I feel like it's my fault

1869
01:26:49,904 --> 01:26:51,633
that we're not as close
as we used to be.

1870
01:26:51,706 --> 01:26:54,698
Ah, it's-it's not your fault.
It's my fault.

1871
01:26:54,776 --> 01:26:57,472
I'm not doing everything
I'm supposed to do.

1872
01:26:57,545 --> 01:26:58,910
Is it too late?

1873
01:26:58,980 --> 01:27:00,845
I don't know.

1874
01:27:02,083 --> 01:27:03,345
You know, baby,

1875
01:27:03,418 --> 01:27:04,578
I just want to tell you

1876
01:27:04,652 --> 01:27:07,951
how sorry I am for being so cold.

1877
01:27:08,022 --> 01:27:10,047
It's not like I don't like
being married.

1878
01:27:10,124 --> 01:27:11,785
It's just that sometimes
it feels like

1879
01:27:11,859 --> 01:27:14,419
the walls are closing in on me.

1880
01:27:14,495 --> 01:27:15,723
Now, hold on one minute.

1881
01:27:15,797 --> 01:27:17,822
Whatever you did,
you did to yourself.

1882
01:27:17,899 --> 01:27:19,127
'Cause I been
running around here,

1883
01:27:19,200 --> 01:27:20,758
trying to make
a nice life for us,

1884
01:27:20,835 --> 01:27:22,769
taking care of the kids,
being Everywoman.

1885
01:27:22,837 --> 01:27:23,804
But lately...

1886
01:27:28,376 --> 01:27:29,365
So have you.

1887
01:27:29,444 --> 01:27:30,604
Oh, grow up.

1888
01:27:30,678 --> 01:27:31,872
You know it's true.

1889
01:27:31,946 --> 01:27:33,038
Look...

1890
01:27:33,114 --> 01:27:36,481
I know none of this is easy,
but I miss us.

1891
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:38,348
I miss what we had.

1892
01:27:38,419 --> 01:27:40,910
I miss it to the core,
and I just need to know...

1893
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:46,659
You the one on strike!

1894
01:27:49,197 --> 01:27:51,665
You out of your fucking mind!

1895
01:27:51,733 --> 01:27:52,859
Careful, nigga.

1896
01:27:52,934 --> 01:27:53,958
Baby, I still want you.

1897
01:27:54,035 --> 01:27:56,060
And I've wanted you for so long.

1898
01:27:56,137 --> 01:27:58,162
But every time I touch you...

1899
01:27:58,239 --> 01:28:02,972
# You act like I did
something wrong #

1900
01:28:03,044 --> 01:28:04,875
- # No, I don't #
- Yes, you do!

1901
01:28:04,946 --> 01:28:06,379
I don't want to leave.

1902
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:07,709
# Neither do I #

1903
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:09,340
I still want you!

1904
01:28:09,417 --> 01:28:10,577
# I'm gonna cry #

1905
01:28:10,652 --> 01:28:12,017
Where are the kids?!

1906
01:28:12,086 --> 01:28:13,314
I told you, they're gone.

1907
01:28:13,388 --> 01:28:16,653
# In that case,
we should be making love #

1908
01:28:16,724 --> 01:28:19,454
# All night long,
all night long #

1909
01:28:19,527 --> 01:28:22,496
# Hee... #

1910
01:28:22,563 --> 01:28:23,495
# All #

1911
01:28:23,564 --> 01:28:28,433
# Night long... #
