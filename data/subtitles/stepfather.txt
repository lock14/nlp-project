1
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,717
Mother!

2
00:06:24,881 --> 00:06:25,962
Gotcha!

3
00:06:26,722 --> 00:06:28,132
All right,

4
00:06:28,219 --> 00:06:30,055
... you're asking for it!
- One more step and...

5
00:06:30,519 --> 00:06:32,657
... you're gonna get it!

6
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:40,492
Parental abuse!

7
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,852
- I'll quit if you quit.
- Truce?

8
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:52,104
Truce.

9
00:06:54,284 --> 00:06:55,989
Help your old mother up.

10
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,133
I had my fingers crossed!

11
00:07:03,778 --> 00:07:06,491
You're gonna be very sorry...
Don't do that!

12
00:07:07,037 --> 00:07:08,161
Not as sorry as you!

13
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,177
Jerry's home!

14
00:07:10,195 --> 00:07:11,668
Come on.

15
00:07:12,524 --> 00:07:13,625
Come on, honey...

16
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:16,627
"Jerry's home"

17
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:18,342
Yeah!

18
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:27,382
Excuse me, lady,

19
00:07:27,403 --> 00:07:29,313
is this the Blake residence?
- It is.

20
00:07:41,963 --> 00:07:43,473
Stephanie home?

21
00:07:43,652 --> 00:07:45,280
She's in the backyard.

22
00:07:48,121 --> 00:07:50,608
- I've got a surprise for her.
- What?

23
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,465
- Something no family should
be without. - What is it?

24
00:07:56,290 --> 00:07:57,283
Stephanie!

25
00:07:57,864 --> 00:07:59,050
There's somebody I'd like you
to meet.

26
00:08:05,996 --> 00:08:09,287
I can't tell you what his name is,
because he doesn't have one yet.

27
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:11,223
Names don't seem to matter much.

28
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,549
I had a dog when I was a kid.

29
00:08:14,396 --> 00:08:17,110
He was just a mutt, but to
me, he was Rin Tin Tin.

30
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,412
Rin Tin Tin?

31
00:08:18,577 --> 00:08:20,356
Well, that was a little before
your time, I guess.

32
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:23,653
So, what do you think? Can we
give this little guy a home?

33
00:08:23,813 --> 00:08:26,305
- Sure.
- That's my girl...

34
00:08:28,435 --> 00:08:31,152
I'll go inside and call Karen
to tell her about the puppy.

35
00:08:31,908 --> 00:08:35,157
- Honey... What do you say?
- Thanks, Jerry!

36
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:44,727
I gotta fix that screendoor
one of these days...

37
00:08:47,116 --> 00:08:49,638
I hope she doesn't think I was
trying to buy her love.

38
00:08:49,802 --> 00:08:52,675
- Maybe the puppy was a mistake.
- The puppy was perfect.

39
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:54,379
You're perfect!

40
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,658
Give her some time.
It'll be fine.

41
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:01,049
I know... All takes time!

42
00:09:02,518 --> 00:09:04,719
And time is one thing I got
plenty of.

43
00:09:12,413 --> 00:09:14,206
I feel like I'm watching a
tennis match.

44
00:09:14,503 --> 00:09:15,959
Stephanie, why don't you ease in
for a landing?

45
00:09:16,633 --> 00:09:18,566
I'll stop pacing if you stop
doodling.

46
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:23,401
All right, you pace, I'll doodle,
and we'll both be happy.

47
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:26,314
We were... talking about your
father.

48
00:09:26,645 --> 00:09:28,612
My father died a year ago.

49
00:09:28,966 --> 00:09:30,803
Sorry, I meant your stepfather.

50
00:09:31,498 --> 00:09:33,215
If my father hadn't died,

51
00:09:33,472 --> 00:09:34,920
there wouldn't be a stepfather.

52
00:09:35,181 --> 00:09:37,316
You're mad at him for dying.

53
00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:39,702
I'm mad at somebody!

54
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:41,044
Being unable to accept your
father's death...

55
00:09:41,393 --> 00:09:44,801
... is part of the reason you've
been getting into trouble.

56
00:09:44,961 --> 00:09:47,030
I'm not in that much trouble.

57
00:09:49,487 --> 00:09:52,127
Suspended three times last year...

58
00:09:52,288 --> 00:09:55,429
Twice this year, and school's
barely been in session two months.

59
00:09:55,816 --> 00:09:57,171
I know what my problem is.

60
00:10:00,036 --> 00:10:01,253
Him.

61
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:03,560
If he wasn't here,

62
00:10:06,308 --> 00:10:08,218
my Mom and I would be alright.

63
00:10:08,668 --> 00:10:09,680
Steph,

64
00:10:10,221 --> 00:10:11,638
you're going to have to
face the fact...

65
00:10:11,794 --> 00:10:13,783
... that your mother loves
the guy.

66
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:15,853
She doesn't see!

67
00:10:16,147 --> 00:10:18,371
Doesn't see what, Stephanie?

68
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:23,656
I think my time is up.

69
00:10:25,584 --> 00:10:26,652
Isn't it?

70
00:10:32,641 --> 00:10:34,364
So, how was your session?

71
00:10:35,172 --> 00:10:36,243
OK.

72
00:10:40,428 --> 00:10:43,340
Sweetheart, it seems like you
and I are always budding heads.

73
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:46,369
How about we try to get along
a little better?

74
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:48,939
Sure.

75
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:51,161
One more thing and then I'll
shut up.

76
00:10:51,571 --> 00:10:54,099
It's very important to your
mother and to me...

77
00:10:54,507 --> 00:10:56,664
... that you try to get along
better in school this year.

78
00:10:59,685 --> 00:11:01,908
What do you say?

79
00:11:08,699 --> 00:11:10,073
Stephanie, knock it off!

80
00:11:13,379 --> 00:11:14,905
Girls, come on, stop it!

81
00:11:17,982 --> 00:11:19,126
Enough!

82
00:11:20,591 --> 00:11:24,038
It's the last time you cause
an outburst in my classroom.

83
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,478
Mr. Conroy! Stephie didn't
start it!

84
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,204
When I want your opinion, Baker,
I'll ask for it.

85
00:11:27,263 --> 00:11:31,903
You couldn't have got yourself
in deeper trouble if you tried.

86
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:46,879
Well, Norah, what do you think?

87
00:11:47,116 --> 00:11:48,686
- I love it!
- I knew you would.

88
00:11:48,996 --> 00:11:50,905
And this is the south. You'll
have sun all day long.

89
00:11:51,412 --> 00:11:53,211
- What do you think, pumpkin?
- I don't know...

90
00:11:53,521 --> 00:11:55,627
Oh! One thing I forgot to
mention.

91
00:11:56,207 --> 00:11:57,778
It comes with a swing set.

92
00:12:04,108 --> 00:12:05,407
I have a daughter, too.

93
00:12:05,988 --> 00:12:08,355
She's a few years older than you.
Her name is Stephanie.

94
00:12:09,056 --> 00:12:10,856
She goes to Oakridge High,

95
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:13,037
which is where you'll be going
one of these days...

96
00:12:13,967 --> 00:12:15,571
... after your parents buy
the house.

97
00:12:17,113 --> 00:12:19,097
- What grade are you in, Cindy?
- Third.

98
00:12:19,413 --> 00:12:20,591
Third grade... !

99
00:12:21,715 --> 00:12:23,745
I remember when Jill was in
third grade.

100
00:12:24,707 --> 00:12:26,831
I used to walk her home from
school every day.

101
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:29,261
- Who's Jill?
- That's my daughter.

102
00:12:29,655 --> 00:12:31,055
You said her name was Stephanie.

103
00:12:32,322 --> 00:12:33,619
Right, Stephanie.

104
00:12:34,413 --> 00:12:35,448
She goes to Oakridge High.

105
00:12:37,231 --> 00:12:38,859
She's on the student council.

106
00:12:39,264 --> 00:12:41,086
She's a straight A's student.

107
00:12:41,490 --> 00:12:43,060
I'm very proud of her.

108
00:12:48,797 --> 00:12:50,750
- Suspended again?
- Expelled.

109
00:12:50,906 --> 00:12:53,394
No! What're you gonna do?

110
00:12:53,936 --> 00:12:55,507
Maybe boarding school.

111
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:58,228
- Really?
- I'm sure gonna try for it.

112
00:12:59,691 --> 00:13:01,905
What's your stepfather gonna
do when he finds out?

113
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:03,942
He's gonna kill me.

114
00:13:05,962 --> 00:13:08,031
Expelled? You're kidding.

115
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:10,925
Principal said it wasn't
working out.

116
00:13:11,351 --> 00:13:12,616
I'm sorry, Mom.

117
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,418
Girls don't get expelled.

118
00:13:14,803 --> 00:13:17,444
All right, it's over...
The damage is done...

119
00:13:17,604 --> 00:13:18,675
Now...

120
00:13:19,331 --> 00:13:21,283
What are we gonna do about
the future?

121
00:13:23,128 --> 00:13:24,928
I wanna go to a boarding
school.

122
00:13:26,313 --> 00:13:27,533
You wanna leave home?

123
00:13:28,652 --> 00:13:30,713
It's not a family without
children.

124
00:13:31,067 --> 00:13:32,366
I think it'd be best for
everybody.

125
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:34,402
Best for everybody?

126
00:13:34,712 --> 00:13:36,774
Running away would be best for
everybody?

127
00:13:36,938 --> 00:13:38,311
It's not running away!

128
00:13:41,693 --> 00:13:42,643
Well,

129
00:13:43,305 --> 00:13:44,483
Jerry, what do you think?

130
00:13:46,719 --> 00:13:49,478
I don't think we have to break up
the family, do we, pumpkin?

131
00:13:54,678 --> 00:13:56,167
Father knows best.

132
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:19,868
Karen, it's freaky, the way he
looks at me...

133
00:14:19,937 --> 00:14:22,543
... like he wanted to erase me
off the face of the earth.

134
00:14:23,044 --> 00:14:24,037
I'm sure.

135
00:14:24,694 --> 00:14:26,221
Ok, don't believe me.

136
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,068
Ok, so, what's the verdict?

137
00:14:28,799 --> 00:14:31,228
Is Scary Jerry gonna let you
go to a boarding school?

138
00:14:31,388 --> 00:14:36,277
I don't know. He has his own fantasy
we should be like families on TV.

139
00:14:36,528 --> 00:14:39,171
Grin and laugh, and have fewer
cavities all the time...

140
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:42,756
It's like having Ward Cleaver
for a Dad.

141
00:14:43,489 --> 00:14:47,132
I gotta hang. Firing squad has
arrived. Bye.

142
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:49,702
Come in.

143
00:14:52,004 --> 00:14:53,111
So, where's my blindfold?

144
00:14:53,137 --> 00:14:54,432
What blindfold?

145
00:14:54,883 --> 00:14:57,734
I thought the condemned person
always got a blindfold.

146
00:15:10,878 --> 00:15:12,831
You don't really wanna leave
home... do you, honey?

147
00:15:15,328 --> 00:15:16,321
Yes, I do.

148
00:15:19,509 --> 00:15:21,691
It isn't our house anymore...

149
00:15:22,348 --> 00:15:23,493
... it's his!

150
00:15:23,652 --> 00:15:25,583
Of course it's our house.

151
00:15:26,567 --> 00:15:28,443
It's always been our house.

152
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:32,354
I loved your father,

153
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:35,153
and when he died I thought:

154
00:15:37,499 --> 00:15:39,454
"Well, maybe that's it.

155
00:15:41,852 --> 00:15:44,421
Maybe you only get one chance
to be happy. "

156
00:15:46,323 --> 00:15:49,002
I never thought I'd love anybody
that much again.

157
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:51,356
I know, Mom.

158
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:53,890
I miss him so bad...

159
00:15:55,069 --> 00:15:57,037
I know you do, honey.

160
00:16:01,435 --> 00:16:03,999
We have a second chance with
Jerry.

161
00:16:05,923 --> 00:16:09,911
He's a wonderful man.
And he wants to care for us.

162
00:16:11,868 --> 00:16:13,439
Can't you just...

163
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,468
... give him a chance?

164
00:16:18,428 --> 00:16:19,883
I'm trying.

165
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:22,607
I'm really trying hard!

166
00:16:23,664 --> 00:16:25,312
There's just something
about him.

167
00:16:25,563 --> 00:16:28,758
- Well, what is it?
- I don't know! I just...

168
00:16:31,317 --> 00:16:32,291
I hope you're not still upset...

169
00:16:32,449 --> 00:16:35,096
... over this school business.

170
00:16:35,402 --> 00:16:37,301
We were just talking about that.

171
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,329
Everything will look clearer
in the morning, uh?

172
00:16:41,443 --> 00:16:42,930
We'll work it out.

173
00:16:45,356 --> 00:16:46,653
Good night, sweetheart.

174
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,591
Good night, Mom.

175
00:16:51,034 --> 00:16:52,586
Sweet dreams, Steph.

176
00:16:54,831 --> 00:16:56,380
G' night, Jerry.

177
00:17:00,431 --> 00:17:02,938
<i>Wilbur, will you turn the page
for me?</i>

178
00:17:03,365 --> 00:17:05,371
<i>Turn it yourself. You've
got a tongue.</i>

179
00:17:05,457 --> 00:17:06,755
<i>No, I'd better not.</i>

180
00:17:06,913 --> 00:17:10,378
<i>I tried it yesterday and swallow
the comic section.</i>

181
00:17:14,221 --> 00:17:17,800
<i>OK, I'll be quiet as a
church mouse.</i>

182
00:17:31,195 --> 00:17:33,799
I used to love this show
when I was a kid.

183
00:17:34,072 --> 00:17:36,693
It wasn't till I got in high school
I realized horses couldn't talk.

184
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:38,915
- I bet you were cute back then.
- Yeah...

185
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:41,122
I'd like to see a picture of you.

186
00:17:41,764 --> 00:17:43,325
You would, wouldn't you?

187
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:45,456
You never talk about your past.

188
00:17:47,077 --> 00:17:49,061
I didn't even exist until
I met you.

189
00:17:49,378 --> 00:17:51,558
Past is important.

190
00:17:57,586 --> 00:17:59,113
Don't try to touch the past.

191
00:18:00,501 --> 00:18:01,862
It isn't real.

192
00:18:02,112 --> 00:18:03,377
It's just a dream.

193
00:18:05,563 --> 00:18:07,289
The only reality is...

194
00:18:07,522 --> 00:18:08,897
... this moment.

195
00:18:10,015 --> 00:18:11,639
You and me.

196
00:18:12,471 --> 00:18:14,606
Here and now.

197
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:40,697
What are we doing here?

198
00:19:41,376 --> 00:19:44,486
This is the house where Henry
Morrison murdered his family.

199
00:19:45,386 --> 00:19:47,007
Do you think I don't remember
that?

200
00:19:49,107 --> 00:19:50,603
I was here that night.

201
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:53,608
I never wanna see anything
like that again.

202
00:19:54,714 --> 00:19:56,903
Yeah, I know. A friend of mine
sent me your article.

203
00:19:57,586 --> 00:20:01,340
I was in Europe at that time.
It took 9 months for me to get it.

204
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,994
Cops did never really catch
the guy.

205
00:20:07,563 --> 00:20:09,813
File's inactive. I think it
should be reopened.

206
00:20:10,213 --> 00:20:12,341
Yeah, well... Talk to the cops.
I'm just a reporter.

207
00:20:12,510 --> 00:20:14,540
Well, I talked to the cops.
They can give a shit.

208
00:20:16,247 --> 00:20:17,724
Listen to me a minute, alright?

209
00:20:18,078 --> 00:20:20,269
Three weeks before Morrison
killed them...

210
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:22,591
... he quit his job, didn't
tell anybody.

211
00:20:22,917 --> 00:20:24,556
Got up every morning, pretending
he'd go to work,

212
00:20:24,576 --> 00:20:26,474
and came home at the
same time every night.

213
00:20:27,065 --> 00:20:28,117
So how far could he go every day...

214
00:20:28,282 --> 00:20:31,819
... and still get back at the same
time every night? Look at this.

215
00:20:32,211 --> 00:20:33,551
It has to be...

216
00:20:35,258 --> 00:20:37,272
... somewhere within this radius.

217
00:20:38,465 --> 00:20:39,567
See, what I think...

218
00:20:40,636 --> 00:20:43,173
... is that during that time he was
setting himself up a new life,

219
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:44,801
somewhere close by.

220
00:20:45,943 --> 00:20:47,991
- What do you want from me?
- Just this:

221
00:20:48,358 --> 00:20:49,854
do a follow up story, right?

222
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:52,630
You run a picture of Morrison.
Your paper circulates in this area.

223
00:20:52,829 --> 00:20:56,420
Someone might recognize him and if
they do, Brennan, you're a hero.

224
00:20:58,606 --> 00:20:59,710
Why are you chasing this?

225
00:21:05,137 --> 00:21:07,263
Vicky Morrison's maden name
was Ogilvie.

226
00:21:10,914 --> 00:21:12,409
She was my sister.

227
00:21:13,882 --> 00:21:15,143
Oh... Jesus!

228
00:21:18,552 --> 00:21:20,363
I'm sorry, Ogilvie, uh?

229
00:21:21,442 --> 00:21:23,254
Ok, I'll do what I can, right?

230
00:21:26,658 --> 00:21:27,603
OK.

231
00:21:31,922 --> 00:21:33,306
This place is mine now.

232
00:21:34,996 --> 00:21:36,178
You wanna go inside?

233
00:21:36,850 --> 00:21:38,031
Fuck no!

234
00:21:49,662 --> 00:21:50,967
I'll take him.

235
00:21:51,363 --> 00:21:54,840
Everybody! Everybody!
Jerry is gonna make a speech!

236
00:21:59,656 --> 00:22:01,906
I guess you all know why I
asked you here.

237
00:22:02,076 --> 00:22:04,021
'Cause when I first started with
American Eagle Realty, a year ago,

238
00:22:04,471 --> 00:22:06,584
you were the first five families
I sold houses to.

239
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,516
Yeah, Jerry, I've been meaning to
ask you about my garage door.

240
00:22:09,685 --> 00:22:11,812
It would still work if you wouldn't
have gotten your car into it.

241
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:15,883
We met doing business and we
stayed to become friends.

242
00:22:16,616 --> 00:22:18,278
And although I may be arguing
against the comission here,

243
00:22:18,345 --> 00:22:21,508
don't sell your houses 'cause
I like being your neighbor.

244
00:22:22,981 --> 00:22:25,486
I wanna get a picture with my
family. Steph! Susan!

245
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:27,949
Come here! Come on down.

246
00:22:28,302 --> 00:22:29,597
Yeah! Come here.

247
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,322
Yeah, come on!

248
00:22:33,628 --> 00:22:35,395
- Come on, Steph.
- Oh, I don't know...

249
00:22:36,201 --> 00:22:38,011
There we are... OK.

250
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:41,483
This is as good as it gets!

251
00:22:45,616 --> 00:22:47,429
I hope you don't think what
I'm gonna say is pretencious.

252
00:22:47,501 --> 00:22:49,170
I sell houses, that's my job,

253
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:52,027
but sometimes I think it's more
than that... I truly believe

254
00:22:53,221 --> 00:22:55,856
... that what I sell is the
American Dream.

255
00:22:57,467 --> 00:22:59,403
You can call me sentimental,
I don't care.

256
00:23:00,073 --> 00:23:01,806
When I came here I was
a stranger,

257
00:23:02,803 --> 00:23:05,211
but I never felt more at home
anywhere in my life.

258
00:23:05,597 --> 00:23:09,639
I have beautiful friends,
I have a wonderful new family...

259
00:23:14,075 --> 00:23:16,340
Have a good time. Thanks
for coming.

260
00:23:32,504 --> 00:23:35,274
Look at this. They'd print
anything to make a buck.

261
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:39,820
- It's just simple sensation.
- What's that, Herb?

262
00:23:40,175 --> 00:23:42,303
That guy in Bellvue who killed
his whole family.

263
00:23:42,472 --> 00:23:44,673
Cut'em up with knives.

264
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,124
I don't think I know about that.

265
00:23:47,616 --> 00:23:50,638
It happened last year, that's
what I was talking about.

266
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:54,351
This thing is a year old and they
go waking it up again.

267
00:23:55,516 --> 00:23:56,777
This is terrible.

268
00:23:58,443 --> 00:23:59,501
Jerry...

269
00:24:00,299 --> 00:24:01,401
Jerry?

270
00:24:01,987 --> 00:24:03,824
You're alright?

271
00:24:05,588 --> 00:24:08,307
This kind of thing really gets
to me, you know?

272
00:24:08,674 --> 00:24:12,029
That a man could be driven to do
something like that to his family?

273
00:24:12,316 --> 00:24:13,689
to his children?

274
00:24:16,273 --> 00:24:18,164
I don't even wanna know
about it.

275
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:22,015
Makes you wonder though...
What's it take to make a guy...

276
00:24:22,187 --> 00:24:23,525
... do such a thing?

277
00:24:24,311 --> 00:24:26,299
Maybe they disappointed him.

278
00:24:33,788 --> 00:24:36,219
Hey, I thought this was
supposed to be a party.

279
00:24:37,474 --> 00:24:39,409
Hey, Tommy! Tommy, come here!

280
00:24:43,109 --> 00:24:45,781
- You're Black Beard, the Pirate.
- Thank you, Mr. Blake.

281
00:24:46,038 --> 00:24:47,176
Aye aye, Captain.

282
00:24:50,934 --> 00:24:54,511
Steph, honey, would you go down
and get the ice cream, please?

283
00:25:23,881 --> 00:25:25,928
All we need is a little order
around here!

284
00:25:26,374 --> 00:25:27,431
Order!!

285
00:25:28,432 --> 00:25:30,402
You're a good boy. You're
Daddy's little angels.

286
00:25:33,419 --> 00:25:35,860
Why don't they just leave
me alone?!

287
00:25:37,216 --> 00:25:38,759
Let me out! Let me out!

288
00:25:40,146 --> 00:25:41,879
We're gonna keep this family
together.

289
00:25:43,746 --> 00:25:45,661
You had better believe it!!

290
00:25:54,216 --> 00:25:55,351
Hi, honey.

291
00:25:59,677 --> 00:26:00,892
Oh, the ice cream.

292
00:26:03,158 --> 00:26:04,262
Honey,

293
00:26:04,884 --> 00:26:06,240
you know how it is.

294
00:26:07,141 --> 00:26:11,343
Being a salesman, smiling all
the time, you know-Sometimes I,

295
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,947
have to let off some steam,
you know?

296
00:26:18,621 --> 00:26:19,881
You know how it is.

297
00:26:20,944 --> 00:26:24,368
Sure. I gotta get back or Mom
is gonna wonder where I'm at.

298
00:27:20,469 --> 00:27:21,605
Steph,

299
00:27:23,554 --> 00:27:25,209
things like these don't happen.

300
00:27:25,495 --> 00:27:26,675
It happened to them.

301
00:27:28,067 --> 00:27:29,484
Let me see if I follow your
thinking.

302
00:27:30,361 --> 00:27:33,401
A man murdered his family.
You hate Jerry.

303
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:37,474
Therefore, Jerry is the man
who murdered his family.

304
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:39,259
Yeah... that all adds up.

305
00:27:39,938 --> 00:27:42,425
Karen, maybe Jerry isn't the guy...

306
00:27:42,789 --> 00:27:45,669
but you don't know him like I do,
or see him down in the basement.

307
00:27:46,508 --> 00:27:49,435
And guess when Jerry showed up
in town and met my Mom?

308
00:27:49,594 --> 00:27:51,091
Right after this!

309
00:27:51,496 --> 00:27:54,162
So, what are you going to do,
Nancy Drew?

310
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:56,274
I'm writing this letter to
the "Seattle Examiner",

311
00:27:56,441 --> 00:27:58,691
and ask them to send me a picture
of Henry Morrison.

312
00:27:59,329 --> 00:28:02,133
I told them I'm in a project
about mass murders.

313
00:28:04,039 --> 00:28:05,807
Off the deep end...

314
00:28:06,296 --> 00:28:07,509
Give me a break.

315
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:18,842
You didn't run his fucking
picture!

316
00:28:19,003 --> 00:28:22,593
- How is anyone gonna identify him?
- Get your hands off of me!

317
00:28:22,761 --> 00:28:25,168
My editor didn't want the picture
not me, huh!

318
00:28:25,651 --> 00:28:27,822
I almost didn't get the article
on the paper at all!

319
00:28:28,501 --> 00:28:31,580
What do you want from me? I just
work here, I don't make policy.

320
00:28:33,605 --> 00:28:34,663
I'm sorry.

321
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:38,245
Yeah, I don't want this to happen
again. Almost gave me a coronary.

322
00:28:38,434 --> 00:28:39,537
Here.

323
00:28:43,638 --> 00:28:46,047
And this is a job for
professionals, Ogilvie.

324
00:28:46,607 --> 00:28:47,912
You're just one man.

325
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,150
Why don't you get on with the rest
of your life? Forget about it!

326
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:56,809
You saw what he did to 'em.

327
00:28:58,235 --> 00:28:59,827
Can you forget about it?

328
00:29:11,237 --> 00:29:14,524
Mom says you only charge half
of your regular fees to see me.

329
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:17,380
How come you do that?

330
00:29:18,134 --> 00:29:20,983
My 3 o'clock pacient is
schizophrenic. I charge him double.

331
00:29:21,222 --> 00:29:22,562
All works out.

332
00:29:23,359 --> 00:29:24,979
Besides, I like seeing you.

333
00:29:26,209 --> 00:29:27,547
You were gonna tell me your idea.

334
00:29:29,296 --> 00:29:32,649
I wanna go to a boarding school.
Don't say it's running away.

335
00:29:32,817 --> 00:29:34,517
- What's the matter with running
away? - It's just that...

336
00:29:36,971 --> 00:29:39,414
- What?
- Sometimes running away is the best.

337
00:29:39,941 --> 00:29:42,190
It gives everybody some breathing
room, right?

338
00:29:43,065 --> 00:29:44,123
Right.

339
00:29:44,294 --> 00:29:45,553
What do your folks say?

340
00:29:46,747 --> 00:29:48,481
I think I can talk my Mom into it.

341
00:29:48,805 --> 00:29:50,973
<i>And what about... him?</i>

342
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:54,615
He has this crazy thing about
breaking up the family.

343
00:29:55,414 --> 00:29:58,137
If you saw this man, you would
say: "Commit him".

344
00:29:59,569 --> 00:30:01,031
You probably are driving
him crazy

345
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:03,048
to a certain extent.
- Yeah...

346
00:30:03,644 --> 00:30:05,028
Why don't I have a talk with him?

347
00:30:06,414 --> 00:30:08,260
If you could be on my side...

348
00:30:08,845 --> 00:30:10,797
<i>I am on your side.</i>

349
00:30:11,322 --> 00:30:12,425
I'll give your father...

350
00:30:13,421 --> 00:30:14,399
Sorry.

351
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,018
<i>I'll give... him a call.</i>

352
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:18,830
You're home awfully early.

353
00:31:20,032 --> 00:31:22,283
Hi, honey, I run out of
appointments.

354
00:31:23,197 --> 00:31:24,581
Anything for me?

355
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,993
As a matter of fact, something
did come for you.

356
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:29,799
Well, can I have it?

357
00:31:30,467 --> 00:31:31,620
I don't know...

358
00:31:32,444 --> 00:31:33,259
What do you mean?

359
00:31:33,406 --> 00:31:36,496
I don't know if it's the kind of
thing you should be looking at.

360
00:31:41,145 --> 00:31:43,290
I'm just kidding. Here you go.

361
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,566
Ohh... My sweet little thing.

362
00:32:15,088 --> 00:32:16,584
My sweet little bitch.

363
00:32:17,067 --> 00:32:19,633
That's my good girl.

364
00:32:20,429 --> 00:32:22,208
Yes, you are daddy...

365
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:58,781
Jerry, honey!

366
00:33:00,889 --> 00:33:01,869
Yes?

367
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,247
Dinner in 15 minutes.

368
00:33:19,881 --> 00:33:20,904
Okay...

369
00:33:22,888 --> 00:33:24,147
Where did you go?

370
00:33:27,954 --> 00:33:29,730
Oh, yeah...

371
00:33:31,317 --> 00:33:33,567
Ahhh... That's my baby.

372
00:33:34,798 --> 00:33:36,014
I'm sorry.

373
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:38,627
Hello?

374
00:33:38,954 --> 00:33:40,135
Hi, Dr. Bondurant.

375
00:33:43,308 --> 00:33:44,285
Jerry?

376
00:33:44,731 --> 00:33:46,781
Dr. Bondurant is on the phone
for you.

377
00:33:48,768 --> 00:33:50,073
What does he want?

378
00:33:50,471 --> 00:33:52,247
He wants you to come in for
a talk.

379
00:33:54,072 --> 00:33:55,535
Tell him I'm not here.

380
00:33:55,773 --> 00:33:57,743
<i>- Why don't you just come up and
talk to him? - Tell him...</i>

381
00:33:57,910 --> 00:33:58,933
I'm not here!

382
00:33:59,691 --> 00:34:02,177
<i>And if he calls back, tell him
I'm still not here.</i>

383
00:34:05,033 --> 00:34:07,047
<i>Er... Jerry can't come to the
phone right now. - I see</i>

384
00:34:08,714 --> 00:34:10,604
Could I have him call you back?

385
00:34:10,772 --> 00:34:12,978
<i>- Yes, that would be fine.
- Thank you.</i>

386
00:34:41,575 --> 00:34:44,457
I take it you're the guy
that called me... Ogilvie?

387
00:34:45,328 --> 00:34:46,869
I'm Lieutenant Wall.

388
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:48,680
You're in my parking space.

389
00:34:48,942 --> 00:34:52,166
I figured this way you'd have to
talk to me about Henry Morrison.

390
00:34:55,421 --> 00:34:58,433
For starters, Morrison isn't his
real name.

391
00:34:59,338 --> 00:35:01,547
- Well, what is it?
- God only knows, we don't.

392
00:35:01,617 --> 00:35:04,872
His personal history was falsified
and his prints were untraceable.

393
00:35:05,557 --> 00:35:07,809
We talked to a criminal
psychologist

394
00:35:08,390 --> 00:35:10,219
who proposed a possibility

395
00:35:10,290 --> 00:35:11,915
you might be interested in.

396
00:35:12,515 --> 00:35:14,925
He said it was possible that
Morrison had done it before.

397
00:35:15,405 --> 00:35:19,151
Married into an existing family,
something upsets him and wipes 'em out.

398
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,662
You knew him,

399
00:35:20,826 --> 00:35:22,007
What do you think?

400
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,219
I think it's better than a
possibility.

401
00:35:25,377 --> 00:35:26,794
What do you plan to do about it?

402
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:29,130
For the moment, nothing.

403
00:35:29,296 --> 00:35:30,948
We don't have a single lead.

404
00:35:31,194 --> 00:35:32,579
The guy is smart!

405
00:35:33,372 --> 00:35:36,298
We won't have anything to go on
unless he does it again.

406
00:35:36,457 --> 00:35:38,584
You're gonna wait until he gets to
another family and butchers them?

407
00:35:38,752 --> 00:35:41,195
You're not hearing me!
We've got nothing!

408
00:35:41,523 --> 00:35:42,828
Zilch!

409
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:45,163
Lieutenant,

410
00:35:45,956 --> 00:35:48,005
if you were me, what would you do?

411
00:35:48,884 --> 00:35:50,697
Just between the two of us?

412
00:35:52,327 --> 00:35:55,175
I'd get a gun and blow the son
of a bitch away.

413
00:36:14,367 --> 00:36:15,707
How do you do, Mrs. Leitner?

414
00:36:15,872 --> 00:36:17,728
- I'm Jerry Blake.
- How do you do? Please sit down.

415
00:36:17,890 --> 00:36:21,008
I've come to talk about the
situation with Stephanie.

416
00:36:21,175 --> 00:36:23,301
I'm afraid, Mr. Blake,
it's a lost cause.

417
00:36:23,707 --> 00:36:27,130
Well... I'm sort of a believer
in lost causes.

418
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:29,298
OK.

419
00:36:29,852 --> 00:36:31,427
I guess I have to face it.

420
00:36:31,752 --> 00:36:34,758
Jerry Blake is the most wonderful
man in the world.

421
00:36:35,077 --> 00:36:36,967
He got you back into school,
didn't he?

422
00:36:37,332 --> 00:36:39,819
You know why, don't you?
To get out of seeing you.

423
00:36:40,497 --> 00:36:41,978
Did it ever ocurred
to you that maybe...

424
00:36:42,041 --> 00:36:44,308
it isn't the rest of
the world that's wrong?

425
00:36:45,438 --> 00:36:48,128
I told you how phony he is, and
how he acted in the basement

426
00:36:48,192 --> 00:36:51,056
... making faces at himself.
- Oh, come on! We all do that.

427
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,968
Why did he freak out and...

428
00:36:54,225 --> 00:36:56,508
absolutely refused
to come and see you?

429
00:36:57,310 --> 00:36:59,087
Because he's afraid
of my eagle eye?

430
00:37:00,516 --> 00:37:01,821
It's more than that.

431
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:08,713
He scares me, Dr. Bondurant.

432
00:37:10,782 --> 00:37:12,182
I'm afraid of him!

433
00:37:25,837 --> 00:37:27,223
Jerry Blake here.

434
00:37:28,885 --> 00:37:30,617
Which house was that?

435
00:37:32,090 --> 00:37:34,656
Yes, sir, I'd be happy
to show you that house, Mr...

436
00:37:35,702 --> 00:37:36,805
Martin?

437
00:37:37,009 --> 00:37:39,258
<i>What about 4:30 tomorrow?</i>

438
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:41,318
Fine! I'll see you then.

439
00:37:55,607 --> 00:37:58,139
So, are you gonna be
coming back to art class?

440
00:37:58,377 --> 00:38:00,627
No. They put me
in typing instead.

441
00:38:01,028 --> 00:38:04,033
What a waste! You've got
a lot of artistic talent.

442
00:38:04,392 --> 00:38:06,327
- Get out of here!
- No, really, I mean it.

443
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:08,741
You'd have a great future
as a big shirt designer.

444
00:38:09,418 --> 00:38:11,467
I really liked the one
you made for Mr. Conroy.

445
00:38:12,386 --> 00:38:14,401
The green hand print was great!

446
00:38:15,869 --> 00:38:19,222
If I buy my own paints, would you
make one like that for me too?

447
00:38:19,469 --> 00:38:21,440
No, but I might
do it to your face.

448
00:38:21,648 --> 00:38:24,888
All right... Give it to me,
give me that shot. Come on!

449
00:38:25,168 --> 00:38:26,665
Maine she takes a jab!

450
00:38:28,414 --> 00:38:30,349
Baker shots her jaws!

451
00:38:31,392 --> 00:38:34,432
Maine pounds at his
middle section!

452
00:38:34,789 --> 00:38:36,253
Baker gets her to the corner!

453
00:38:46,323 --> 00:38:48,476
- I'll see you tomorrow in school.
- Sure, great.

454
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,554
- Well, bye.
- Bye.

455
00:39:49,273 --> 00:39:52,390
- Hi, sorry I'm a little late.
- No problem, no problem.

456
00:39:52,715 --> 00:39:54,921
- Ray Martin.
- Hi, Ray. Jerry Blake.

457
00:39:55,406 --> 00:39:58,524
- It's a great house.
- Wait till you see inside. Come.

458
00:40:02,213 --> 00:40:04,936
- Come on in.
- Big mirror in the hall.

459
00:40:05,814 --> 00:40:07,278
And lot of closets in here.

460
00:40:07,794 --> 00:40:09,807
It's great. Kitchen back here?

461
00:40:10,365 --> 00:40:11,704
Yes, it's back here, yeah.

462
00:40:12,259 --> 00:40:14,667
I forgot to tell you,
lovely hardwood floors.

463
00:40:15,085 --> 00:40:17,020
Look at the inlaid.
It's terrific.

464
00:40:17,278 --> 00:40:20,238
- Right, very nice.
- I'll show you the bedroom.

465
00:40:22,162 --> 00:40:23,422
Lot of space here.

466
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:26,672
Lot of room for kids.
You a family man, Ray?

467
00:40:26,736 --> 00:40:29,163
Confirmed bachelor.
How about you, Jerry?

468
00:40:29,603 --> 00:40:31,730
Happily married. I wouldn't
trade it for the world.

469
00:40:32,691 --> 00:40:35,352
I don't know... I think
it just works for some guys.

470
00:40:35,675 --> 00:40:36,778
What's that?

471
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:41,130
<i>You know, the family, home
sweet home, all that crap.</i>

472
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:55,191
What line of work are you in, Ray?
If you don't mind my asking.

473
00:40:55,742 --> 00:40:58,387
Oh! Not at all!
I'm in stress management.

474
00:40:58,451 --> 00:41:02,077
Sounds complicated.
The kitchen has been remodeled.

475
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,098
Built-ins. I like this.

476
00:41:04,659 --> 00:41:08,925
I try to find ways for employers
and employees to get along better.

477
00:41:09,463 --> 00:41:11,906
I ask questions,
they give me answers.

478
00:41:12,765 --> 00:41:14,734
<i>For instance: How do you sleep
at night?</i>

479
00:41:15,953 --> 00:41:17,654
How do you sleep at night, Jerry?

480
00:41:18,537 --> 00:41:20,975
- I sleep like a baby.
- See, that's interesting.

481
00:41:21,885 --> 00:41:24,575
Because I think there'd be a lot
of stress in your line of work.

482
00:41:25,606 --> 00:41:29,274
I suppose there's a certain degree
of stress in every job, Ray.

483
00:41:29,443 --> 00:41:30,984
It depends on how you handle it.

484
00:41:32,580 --> 00:41:34,332
Which way am I facing?

485
00:41:35,107 --> 00:41:36,018
North.

486
00:41:39,465 --> 00:41:43,212
Come on in here, Ray. Great big
room for kids to tumble around in.

487
00:41:44,361 --> 00:41:46,701
You know, a house like this should
really have a family in it.

488
00:41:47,249 --> 00:41:49,342
You mean you won't sell it to me
because I don't have one?

489
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:53,148
Oh, no! I didn't say that.
This is all being remodeled here.

490
00:41:53,707 --> 00:41:56,300
You really are a fan of traditional
values, aren't you, Jerry?

491
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:58,097
Tradition is important.

492
00:41:59,408 --> 00:42:01,301
Sounds like you had
a strict up-bringing?

493
00:42:03,164 --> 00:42:04,469
You might say that.

494
00:42:06,079 --> 00:42:08,383
- Let me ask you a question, Ray.
- Sure.

495
00:42:10,151 --> 00:42:12,482
Are you interested in
buying a house or in me?

496
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:14,839
Sorry.

497
00:42:15,047 --> 00:42:16,167
Force of habit.

498
00:42:16,303 --> 00:42:18,272
My wife gets on me
for that all the time.

499
00:42:22,357 --> 00:42:24,502
I thought you said
you were a bachelor...

500
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,989
- Er... Recently divorced.
- I see.

501
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:29,509
Sometimes I forget
I'm not married anymore.

502
00:42:29,796 --> 00:42:31,294
Probably it's just stress.

503
00:42:34,330 --> 00:42:35,483
What are you-- ?

504
00:42:43,515 --> 00:42:45,688
Who are you?
How did you get on to me?

505
00:42:48,131 --> 00:42:50,860
I'm looking for--a house--

506
00:42:51,216 --> 00:42:51,969
Oh, oh, oh...

507
00:42:52,036 --> 00:42:54,102
I don't think this house
is right for you.

508
00:42:54,263 --> 00:42:56,042
I think you'd be more comfortable
somewhere else.

509
00:42:56,305 --> 00:42:57,768
This house is for a family!

510
00:42:57,831 --> 00:42:59,642
You know what I mean?
A family...!?

511
00:42:59,714 --> 00:43:00,913
... Home, sweet home?!

512
00:43:01,075 --> 00:43:02,246
All that crap!!

513
00:43:28,414 --> 00:43:29,393
OK.

514
00:43:30,037 --> 00:43:31,060
It's alright.

515
00:43:33,096 --> 00:43:34,592
A little order around here...

516
00:43:35,984 --> 00:43:37,918
Just a little order, that's all.

517
00:43:38,438 --> 00:43:40,189
A little order around here!!

518
00:43:46,664 --> 00:43:47,723
Bondurant.

519
00:43:50,661 --> 00:43:51,921
Dr. Bondurant?

520
00:43:58,141 --> 00:43:59,085
Well,

521
00:43:59,881 --> 00:44:01,536
Dr. Bondurant.

522
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:12,741
Rest in peace, doctor.

523
00:44:19,677 --> 00:44:20,982
Come on, come on, Doctor.
Let's go.

524
00:44:30,995 --> 00:44:32,176
All right, doctor.

525
00:44:32,697 --> 00:44:33,721
We got to go...

526
00:44:33,965 --> 00:44:35,224
... a little ride.

527
00:44:36,102 --> 00:44:36,740
We'll take a little ride.

528
00:44:37,187 --> 00:44:41,004
You seem disappointed he didn't
turn out to be Jack the Ripper.

529
00:44:42,485 --> 00:44:43,834
I was wrong, Karen.

530
00:44:45,910 --> 00:44:47,530
I was totally wrong.

531
00:44:57,245 --> 00:44:58,269
Doctor.

532
00:45:22,833 --> 00:45:24,426
Buckle up for safety.

533
00:47:09,696 --> 00:47:10,674
Steph?

534
00:47:15,474 --> 00:47:18,196
I'm sorry, honey. I have some
bad news about Dr. Bondurant.

535
00:47:20,065 --> 00:47:21,481
His office just called.

536
00:47:23,191 --> 00:47:25,913
What? I shouldn't go
to my hour tomorrow?

537
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:28,291
No, no. It's more
serious than that.

538
00:47:30,234 --> 00:47:32,957
There was an accident sometime
last night up by the highway.

539
00:47:33,836 --> 00:47:36,795
He-- lost control or something,
his car went off the road.

540
00:47:38,103 --> 00:47:39,399
His car?

541
00:47:44,225 --> 00:47:45,248
He's dead, Steph.

542
00:47:48,998 --> 00:47:50,101
Sorry.

543
00:47:53,124 --> 00:47:54,243
What happened?

544
00:47:55,521 --> 00:47:56,955
Nobody knows.

545
00:47:57,501 --> 00:47:59,865
Police say he lost
control of his car.

546
00:48:00,588 --> 00:48:02,872
Just one of those stupid
unnecessary accidents.

547
00:48:05,906 --> 00:48:07,718
He was my friend!

548
00:48:08,959 --> 00:48:10,112
I know, baby.

549
00:48:13,656 --> 00:48:15,828
He was a very special man.

550
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:19,587
In his own way, he helped
bring us together.

551
00:48:23,194 --> 00:48:25,287
And nothing is ever
gonna split us apart.

552
00:50:20,929 --> 00:50:22,234
Can I help?

553
00:50:23,326 --> 00:50:24,708
Yeah, would you honey?
Thanks.

554
00:50:29,923 --> 00:50:31,340
What do you think?

555
00:50:32,346 --> 00:50:33,460
I like it!

556
00:50:33,546 --> 00:50:34,711
Is it straight?

557
00:50:36,521 --> 00:50:37,658
A little bit towards me.

558
00:50:38,737 --> 00:50:39,681
Perfect!

559
00:50:42,772 --> 00:50:44,427
- Jerry...
- Yeah?

560
00:50:47,879 --> 00:50:49,420
I just wanna say that...

561
00:50:50,411 --> 00:50:52,110
I know I've been a
lot of trouble.

562
00:50:53,022 --> 00:50:54,159
And I'm sorry...

563
00:50:57,297 --> 00:51:00,572
Well, let's say we owe each other
an apology and bury the hatchets.

564
00:51:02,046 --> 00:51:03,071
Deal.

565
00:51:09,004 --> 00:51:11,938
When I was a kid I went through
some pretty rough times myself.

566
00:51:13,939 --> 00:51:15,148
So, what happened?

567
00:51:16,653 --> 00:51:18,633
I outgrew my problems
and so will you.

568
00:51:19,518 --> 00:51:21,533
Besides, you'll be too busy
checking boyfriends.

569
00:51:22,554 --> 00:51:23,656
Boyfriends?

570
00:51:24,018 --> 00:51:27,766
Yeah, you know...
Boys, girls, dating.

571
00:51:29,796 --> 00:51:32,486
He's so old fashioned.
Aren't you?

572
00:51:32,645 --> 00:51:35,368
Guilty as charged, Your Honor.

573
00:51:36,920 --> 00:51:38,776
There's plenty of time
for that, sweetheart.

574
00:51:39,294 --> 00:51:40,869
Don't try to grow up
too fast, huh?

575
00:51:41,035 --> 00:51:42,137
OK.

576
00:51:42,855 --> 00:51:45,186
It'll be nice with a family of
birds leaving in there.

577
00:52:25,674 --> 00:52:26,810
Dear Lord,

578
00:52:27,375 --> 00:52:29,582
we thank you for the meal
we're about to enjoy,

579
00:52:30,661 --> 00:52:32,395
for our dear friends,

580
00:52:32,758 --> 00:52:34,807
our wonderful home,

581
00:52:35,523 --> 00:52:36,828
but most of all, Father,

582
00:52:37,111 --> 00:52:40,465
we thank you for bringing us
together as a family.

583
00:52:42,296 --> 00:52:44,248
- Amen.
- Amen.

584
00:52:50,408 --> 00:52:51,984
Oh... sweetheart,

585
00:52:52,476 --> 00:52:55,087
everything looks absolutely
perfect.

586
00:52:56,632 --> 00:52:58,442
What do you think of this
turkey, Steph, huh?

587
00:52:58,898 --> 00:53:00,333
Looks almost good enough to eat.

588
00:53:00,402 --> 00:53:01,460
Yeah.

589
00:53:01,725 --> 00:53:04,336
What do you say if we cut up
this bird? Steph?

590
00:53:04,398 --> 00:53:05,536
Light or dark?

591
00:53:05,937 --> 00:53:08,898
Wait, wait, wait, let me guess.
You're the...

592
00:53:10,107 --> 00:53:11,245
... drumstick-type.

593
00:53:11,268 --> 00:53:12,957
Two drumstick-type.

594
00:53:17,593 --> 00:53:18,746
You know?

595
00:53:19,800 --> 00:53:21,504
Until this moment,

596
00:53:23,181 --> 00:53:25,966
I never realized what
Thanksgiving was all about.

597
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,298
Well, if it isn't
the Road Warrior!

598
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:08,028
- Come on, hop on.
- Looks dangerous...

599
00:54:08,389 --> 00:54:11,558
<i>- No, this bike is totally safe.
- I meant you.</i>

600
00:54:11,751 --> 00:54:15,748
Me? You are the dangerous one,
you and that mean right hook.

601
00:54:15,907 --> 00:54:17,765
Come on... Chicken.

602
00:54:21,159 --> 00:54:22,829
Only if I get to drive.

603
00:54:24,506 --> 00:54:28,142
So how come you're not with ever
popular Kathy Lombardo tonight?

604
00:54:28,621 --> 00:54:30,748
Kathy Lombardo is a
stuck up bitch.

605
00:54:30,917 --> 00:54:32,255
She dumped you!

606
00:54:32,498 --> 00:54:34,074
No, no! I dumped her.

607
00:54:34,636 --> 00:54:36,134
Alright, alright,
she dumped me.

608
00:54:36,497 --> 00:54:39,140
Come on! Watch where
you're going. Easy.

609
00:54:40,098 --> 00:54:43,181
We're OK now. You can stop
holding on so tight.

610
00:54:43,581 --> 00:54:44,715
Do I have to?

611
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:47,062
Not if you don't want to.

612
00:54:59,647 --> 00:55:01,617
- I walk you up.
- OK.

613
00:55:13,349 --> 00:55:15,002
Well, thanks for the ride.

614
00:55:15,634 --> 00:55:18,031
- It's your bike.
- Right.

615
00:55:20,461 --> 00:55:22,065
Well...

616
00:55:22,671 --> 00:55:24,500
- Good night.
- Good night.

617
00:55:26,963 --> 00:55:29,010
I-I- guess I'll see you
in school, huh?

618
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:31,275
I guess so.

619
00:55:34,797 --> 00:55:36,181
That's the Miller's dog.

620
00:55:36,340 --> 00:55:37,445
Yeah.

621
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,548
Anyway-- er-- bye.

622
00:55:43,266 --> 00:55:44,403
Bye...

623
00:55:58,067 --> 00:55:59,091
You!

624
00:56:00,678 --> 00:56:03,370
You could go to jail!
This girl is 16 years old!

625
00:56:03,529 --> 00:56:06,015
- And so am I.
- Jerry. What's wrong?

626
00:56:06,180 --> 00:56:08,227
This punk was trying
to rape our daughter!

627
00:56:08,396 --> 00:56:09,734
I just kissed her good night!

628
00:56:09,899 --> 00:56:11,396
Stephanie? What's going on?

629
00:56:11,563 --> 00:56:14,388
- Go home, Paul!
- Steph, are you sure?

630
00:56:14,728 --> 00:56:16,197
Go home and I'll talk to you
tomorrow...Go!

631
00:56:16,265 --> 00:56:18,087
Would somebody please tell me
what this is all about?

632
00:56:18,289 --> 00:56:19,427
He kissed me good night.

633
00:56:19,991 --> 00:56:22,355
I wanted him to.
I like Paul, Mom!

634
00:56:22,524 --> 00:56:26,238
- Of course you do, honey...
- She's still a child!

635
00:56:26,402 --> 00:56:27,582
I'm not a child!

636
00:56:28,143 --> 00:56:31,417
Just 'cause you're a crazy
demented about sex!

637
00:56:31,586 --> 00:56:34,703
- Don't you talk to your father
that way!
- He's not my father.

638
00:56:35,464 --> 00:56:38,346
He's just some crazy creep!
How can you even bare to...

639
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:39,529
... let him touch you?
- Stop it!

640
00:56:39,700 --> 00:56:42,107
He's your father now and
you'll respect him!

641
00:56:45,121 --> 00:56:47,654
Stephanie!
Stephanie, come back!

642
00:56:48,089 --> 00:56:50,855
Let her go, Susan. She'll come
back when she calms down.

643
00:56:50,869 --> 00:56:52,202
What were you thinking of...

644
00:56:52,363 --> 00:56:55,054
... making such a stupid scene?
- That punk was undressing her!

645
00:56:55,212 --> 00:56:57,744
That's Paul Baker. I've known him
longer than I've known you!

646
00:56:58,616 --> 00:57:01,904
- Meaning what?
- All the progress we've made

647
00:57:02,067 --> 00:57:06,169
with Stephanie thrown away,
just thrown away! by you!

648
00:57:13,583 --> 00:57:14,562
I...

649
00:57:47,810 --> 00:57:49,778
- Bye, Ron.
- Good luck. Take care.

650
00:57:51,015 --> 00:57:53,107
- Good bye, Audrey, don't work
too hard, uh? - Good luck!

651
00:57:53,705 --> 00:57:55,279
Bye Sylvia, thanks for everything.

652
00:58:05,062 --> 00:58:06,919
- Bye everybody!
- Bye, Jerry!

653
00:58:10,286 --> 00:58:12,900
- We'll miss you, Jerry.
- Thanks, Mr. Grace.

654
00:58:13,066 --> 00:58:14,313
- Good luck.
- Thanks for everything. Good bye.

655
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:31,937
Just listen to me. All I'm saying
is that the guy just married again,

656
00:58:32,181 --> 00:58:34,109
to a divorcee with kids or
a widow. I know him!

657
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,485
This guy can not live
without a family.

658
00:58:37,002 --> 00:58:39,339
- Now, you gotta help me!
- I don't have time.

659
00:58:39,500 --> 00:58:41,646
Come on! All I'm asking for are
copies of marriage certificates

660
00:58:41,724 --> 00:58:45,110
for the last year. How much
time is that gonna take?

661
00:58:45,318 --> 00:58:47,366
More time than I've got
or care to spare.

662
00:58:47,534 --> 00:58:49,188
Come back in a couple of weeks.

663
00:58:49,354 --> 00:58:51,369
- I need them now!
- Good bye...

664
00:58:52,408 --> 00:58:54,997
- Asshole.
- You're not qualified.

665
00:58:55,132 --> 00:58:57,627
- What?
- To call him asshole.

666
00:58:57,970 --> 00:59:00,040
It's an earned privilege. You have
to know him for half an hour.

667
00:59:00,668 --> 00:59:03,358
Well, perhaps you can help me
here, Miss... Barnes.

668
00:59:03,805 --> 00:59:06,871
I could. The question is:
why should I?

669
00:59:06,975 --> 00:59:09,295
Because the asshole wouldn't
like it, and I would.

670
00:59:10,884 --> 00:59:12,188
What do you say, Miss Barnes?

671
00:59:14,416 --> 00:59:15,581
I say...

672
00:59:16,497 --> 00:59:18,747
... you're qualified to call
me Annie.

673
00:59:19,522 --> 00:59:20,499
Ok.

674
00:59:22,529 --> 00:59:24,228
Honey... honey!

675
00:59:25,282 --> 00:59:29,171
They say this Dr. is one of the
best. Have a good session, huh?

676
00:59:49,743 --> 00:59:50,958
Miss Maine?

677
00:59:51,286 --> 00:59:52,671
Miss Stephanie Maine?

678
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:55,020
Sorry, wrong office.

679
01:01:24,509 --> 01:01:26,033
- Mr. Meredith?
- Yeah, that's me.

680
01:01:27,421 --> 01:01:29,025
Sorry to have bothered you.
Thanks.

681
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:50,380
Over here.

682
01:04:00,823 --> 01:04:03,433
This house was supposed to be
empty. I'm sorry about that.

683
01:04:17,924 --> 01:04:21,461
- Hi, I'm Bill Hodgkins.
- The man who phoned about the job?

684
01:04:21,481 --> 01:04:22,844
- That's right.
- Roy Chesterton.

685
01:04:22,909 --> 01:04:24,045
How'd you do?

686
01:04:24,253 --> 01:04:27,216
- You ever sold insurance before?
- Back east in Pennsylvania.

687
01:04:27,579 --> 01:04:29,942
If there's a policy I haven't sold
I'd like to know what it is.

688
01:04:30,112 --> 01:04:31,843
Especialized in any one area?

689
01:04:32,089 --> 01:04:34,510
Well, I'm pretty comfortable
in all of them but if I have a

690
01:04:34,523 --> 01:04:37,985
personal crusade, it's family
related policies, life insurance.

691
01:04:38,146 --> 01:04:41,263
That's a toughy. People don't
wanna think they're gonna die

692
01:04:42,141 --> 01:04:44,191
- I know I don't.
- Death is always something

693
01:04:44,359 --> 01:04:45,743
that happens to someone else.

694
01:04:46,139 --> 01:04:48,672
That's why I really believe that
I'm protecting the family.

695
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:52,106
I'm glad to hear you say that.
That's our main objective here.

696
01:05:37,199 --> 01:05:38,143
Jerry?

697
01:05:39,375 --> 01:05:40,838
We have to talk, honey.

698
01:05:41,709 --> 01:05:42,577
About what?

699
01:05:42,807 --> 01:05:43,848
About what?

700
01:05:45,368 --> 01:05:47,672
About what is happening
to our family.

701
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:50,676
I'm taking care of it.

702
01:05:52,117 --> 01:05:53,508
By yourself?

703
01:06:21,205 --> 01:06:22,982
Daddy is home!
Daddy is home!

704
01:06:25,360 --> 01:06:27,610
- Daddy, Daddy!
- Look who's here!

705
01:07:28,845 --> 01:07:30,814
- Yes?
- Hi! Is Gerald Blake home?

706
01:07:30,981 --> 01:07:33,189
No. Was he supposed to show
you a house?

707
01:07:33,753 --> 01:07:34,810
He sells houses?

708
01:07:34,979 --> 01:07:36,442
Yes, he does.

709
01:07:36,878 --> 01:07:38,015
Can I help you?

710
01:07:38,184 --> 01:07:39,804
No, I'll just drop by later.

711
01:07:40,479 --> 01:07:42,134
See, I'm not even sure it's
the same Gerald Blake.

712
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:43,481
Well, I can give him a
message for you.

713
01:07:43,646 --> 01:07:44,828
No, that's okay.

714
01:07:46,099 --> 01:07:48,383
If it's the guy I know, I'd
rather just surprise him.

715
01:07:48,949 --> 01:07:50,368
- All right.
- Ok, thanks.

716
01:07:50,612 --> 01:07:51,749
You're welcome.

717
01:08:23,303 --> 01:08:24,281
Hi.

718
01:08:25,006 --> 01:08:26,062
Hello.

719
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,001
I'm Bill Hodgkins. I've just
rented the house next door.

720
01:08:30,182 --> 01:08:31,240
So, we're neighbors.

721
01:08:32,811 --> 01:08:34,118
I'm Dorothy Reinhard.

722
01:08:34,661 --> 01:08:36,045
Welcome to Madison St.

723
01:08:36,299 --> 01:08:37,062
Thank you.

724
01:08:39,002 --> 01:08:40,009
Hard work.

725
01:08:40,174 --> 01:08:43,871
Oh, the kids were supposed to do
it, but... you know how kids are.

726
01:08:45,197 --> 01:08:47,257
It's just you and the kids, then?

727
01:08:48,041 --> 01:08:48,986
Yeah.

728
01:08:52,474 --> 01:08:53,611
Jerry Blake, please?

729
01:08:53,972 --> 01:08:57,056
I'm sorry but Mr. Blake is no
longer connected with this agency.

730
01:08:57,873 --> 01:08:59,543
There must be some mistake.

731
01:08:59,721 --> 01:09:02,137
<i>No, there isn't. I can give you
his home number though. It's...</i>

732
01:09:02,171 --> 01:09:05,270
I know that number! I'm calling
from that number.

733
01:09:05,511 --> 01:09:07,953
I'm sorry, Madam, but Mr. Blake
left several days ago.

734
01:09:10,869 --> 01:09:12,175
Well, thank you very much.

735
01:09:24,246 --> 01:09:25,946
- It's about time!
- Mrs. Fairfax?

736
01:09:26,157 --> 01:09:31,245
Not for long. Put this in the
trunk. I'm leaving now!

737
01:09:33,002 --> 01:09:34,780
Is this him? Is this the guy?

738
01:09:34,941 --> 01:09:36,956
Sure, I'm having an affair
with the cab driver.

739
01:09:37,118 --> 01:09:39,650
You let her in your cab and I'll
break every bone in your body!

740
01:09:39,809 --> 01:09:42,970
- I'm not a cab driver, okay?
- OK.

741
01:09:43,647 --> 01:09:45,145
I just wanna ask you a question.

742
01:09:45,706 --> 01:09:47,484
You ever seen this guy before?

743
01:09:48,871 --> 01:09:51,403
The beard's new, but he looks like
the guy who sold us this house.

744
01:09:51,742 --> 01:09:53,206
- Muriel?
- Could be him.

745
01:09:53,605 --> 01:09:54,863
He sells houses?

746
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:56,740
Yeah... that's right.

747
01:10:08,736 --> 01:10:10,595
Hey, what the hell are you
doing, buddy?

748
01:10:29,892 --> 01:10:31,213
Hi, honey.

749
01:10:33,017 --> 01:10:34,232
Where've you been?

750
01:10:34,442 --> 01:10:36,585
Showing the Morton house to
some folks from California.

751
01:10:36,851 --> 01:10:39,287
- Don't lie to me, Jerry.
- What?

752
01:10:39,785 --> 01:10:41,203
I called your office today.

753
01:10:41,654 --> 01:10:42,768
I didn't get the message.

754
01:10:43,261 --> 01:10:45,415
Of course you didn't. They said
you stopped working there...

755
01:10:45,482 --> 01:10:47,865
... several days ago.
- What?

756
01:10:48,604 --> 01:10:50,494
The recepcionist said
that you left!

757
01:10:50,757 --> 01:10:51,932
That idiot!

758
01:10:52,104 --> 01:10:54,614
That new girl can't...
Susan... I've never

759
01:10:54,918 --> 01:10:56,589
got anyone fired in my life,

760
01:10:56,756 --> 01:10:59,148
but that girl... I don't know...
- You mean you still work there?

761
01:10:59,470 --> 01:11:01,299
Of course. Where else
would I be?

762
01:11:01,410 --> 01:11:03,999
I don't know! I just-I don't

763
01:11:04,162 --> 01:11:06,222
know what I thought. Sorry.

764
01:11:06,289 --> 01:11:08,285
This is very upsetting. I hope
Grace is still there...

765
01:11:08,455 --> 01:11:11,608
No, forget it, honey.
Forget it! She probably just--

766
01:11:12,158 --> 01:11:13,908
got the name wrong or
something.

767
01:11:13,972 --> 01:11:15,975
Hodgkins! What's to get wrong?

768
01:11:16,751 --> 01:11:17,855
What did you say?

769
01:11:18,126 --> 01:11:19,150
What?

770
01:11:21,021 --> 01:11:22,500
Wait a minute...

771
01:11:23,818 --> 01:11:25,000
Who am I here?

772
01:11:26,272 --> 01:11:27,328
Jerry... !

773
01:11:27,657 --> 01:11:29,159
Jerry?

774
01:11:30,585 --> 01:11:33,466
Jerry Blake. Thank you, honey.

775
01:11:42,366 --> 01:11:44,060
You're alright, sweetheart?

776
01:11:45,624 --> 01:11:46,648
Jerry?

777
01:11:50,453 --> 01:11:53,255
Where are you going?
Susan! Susan, come here!

778
01:11:53,499 --> 01:11:54,680
Come here!

779
01:12:23,715 --> 01:12:25,684
A little order around here, huh!

780
01:12:30,656 --> 01:12:31,769
Come on, Rinnie.

781
01:12:32,628 --> 01:12:34,319
Come on, Rinnie. Come on, fella.

782
01:12:34,864 --> 01:12:36,219
Come on, come on...

783
01:12:36,492 --> 01:12:37,734
Come on, fella, come on...

784
01:12:38,665 --> 01:12:40,636
Come see me, come on...

785
01:12:41,013 --> 01:12:43,062
Here boy, here boy.

786
01:12:43,731 --> 01:12:47,479
Yeah! That's my little fella.

787
01:12:47,649 --> 01:12:49,776
That's a good Rinnie,
that's a good Rinnie, yeah.

788
01:12:55,162 --> 01:12:57,069
Oh, yes! Yeah, you're a good dog.

789
01:12:57,513 --> 01:12:58,671
You're a good dog!

790
01:12:59,108 --> 01:13:00,263
Mom?

791
01:13:01,077 --> 01:13:02,686
Mom? you home?

792
01:13:07,485 --> 01:13:10,839
Hey. What they do? Leave you
alone?

793
01:13:17,375 --> 01:13:18,849
You're a very bad girl...

794
01:13:20,620 --> 01:13:22,372
Come on, move!

795
01:13:23,882 --> 01:13:25,459
Come on! Come on!

796
01:14:52,117 --> 01:14:53,141
Jim...

797
01:14:55,718 --> 01:14:57,104
Jim Ogilvie!

798
01:14:58,292 --> 01:14:59,631
That's-- blood.

799
01:15:34,072 --> 01:15:35,332
Next time, Jim,

800
01:15:36,199 --> 01:15:37,536
call before you drop by.

801
01:15:56,624 --> 01:15:58,127
Hi, pumpkin.

802
01:16:06,087 --> 01:16:07,679
Steph...

803
01:16:09,127 --> 01:16:10,562
Help! Somebody help me!

804
01:16:12,546 --> 01:16:15,333
Help! Please!!
Somebody help me!

805
01:16:17,075 --> 01:16:20,160
Help me! Help!

806
01:16:29,478 --> 01:16:30,861
Open the door!!

807
01:16:31,021 --> 01:16:32,080
Open the... damned...

808
01:16:32,250 --> 01:16:33,194
door!!

809
01:16:51,592 --> 01:16:52,536
Oh, no!

810
01:16:53,016 --> 01:16:53,995
No!

811
01:16:54,451 --> 01:16:55,701
Help!

812
01:17:06,005 --> 01:17:07,554
Come on down, Steph!

813
01:17:26,307 --> 01:17:27,285
Steph!

814
01:17:30,472 --> 01:17:32,712
It's ok, sweetheart, I won't
hurt you.

815
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:37,755
Steph, come out here now!
Get out here!!

816
01:17:40,127 --> 01:17:41,263
Steph.

817
01:17:42,937 --> 01:17:44,074
Come on, honey.

818
01:17:44,832 --> 01:17:46,373
Where are you, Steph?

819
01:17:50,693 --> 01:17:52,236
Come on, honey, it's alright.

820
01:17:55,125 --> 01:17:56,746
It's all a game, Steph, uh?

821
01:18:00,277 --> 01:18:01,784
Come on, Steph, it was all a...

822
01:18:01,849 --> 01:18:02,505
... misunderstanding!!

823
01:18:02,599 --> 01:18:03,877
No!

824
01:18:05,886 --> 01:18:08,195
- No!! Please!!
- Come to Daddy! Come here!

825
01:18:08,355 --> 01:18:10,157
- Come here!
- No!! Please!!

826
01:18:12,501 --> 01:18:13,812
Stephanie!

827
01:18:14,551 --> 01:18:16,053
Stephanie!!

828
01:19:00,081 --> 01:19:01,314
Stephanie!

829
01:19:01,716 --> 01:19:02,854
Stephanie?

830
01:19:03,261 --> 01:19:04,204
Mommy?

831
01:19:18,447 --> 01:19:19,787
No, Jerry!

832
01:19:30,033 --> 01:19:31,554
Stephanie, the knife!

833
01:19:37,709 --> 01:19:38,925
Leave her alone!!

834
01:19:50,171 --> 01:19:51,385
Stephanie!

835
01:19:56,344 --> 01:19:57,639
Stop it!

836
01:20:08,500 --> 01:20:11,042
I... I love you...
