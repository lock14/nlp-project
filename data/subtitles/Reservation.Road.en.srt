1
00:00:57,424 --> 00:00:58,683
Come on!

2
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,048
Let's go.

3
00:01:35,583 --> 00:01:38,875
All right!
God, that was wonderful!

4
00:01:45,438 --> 00:01:48,696
Hey, Josh!
Hey, Josh! Hey!

5
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,324
Wasn't he great?

6
00:01:53,896 --> 00:01:56,847
Let's go Red Sox,
Let's go!

7
00:01:57,026 --> 00:01:59,993
Let's go Red Sox,
Let's go!

8
00:02:00,889 --> 00:02:03,003
Let's go Red Sox,
Let's go!

9
00:02:03,675 --> 00:02:06,176
Let's go Red Sox,
Let's go!

10
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,114
Let's go Red Sox,
Let's go!

11
00:02:11,743 --> 00:02:13,207
Come on.
Let's go!

12
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:14,603
Let's go!

13
00:02:20,733 --> 00:02:24,025
Come on, Mom,
it's almost over.

14
00:02:24,095 --> 00:02:25,821
She wants to
talk to you.

15
00:02:25,893 --> 00:02:28,980
Ruth, the game's just
going a little long.

16
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:32,981
No, we're gonna...
We're gonna...

17
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:34,571
You look good.

18
00:02:38,743 --> 00:02:42,830
We're going to be heading out of
here as soon as the game's over.

19
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,990
Ruth, I'll get
him home.

20
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:56,686
Okay, a super-heroic run
and a super-heroic throw!

21
00:02:59,251 --> 00:03:02,838
Oh! Super-heroic!
Oh, yeah!

22
00:03:04,845 --> 00:03:07,501
Go!
What are you doing!

23
00:03:08,806 --> 00:03:10,860
- Hey, Dad, can I change the station?
- Yeah.

24
00:03:10,937 --> 00:03:14,729
Tickets for Wednesday, September
16's game can be purchased...

25
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:18,550
Man, your mom
is gonna kill me.

26
00:03:18,627 --> 00:03:22,055
Hey, Mommy! Mommy!
Look what Josh got me!

27
00:03:22,123 --> 00:03:23,984
- What is it?
- Fireflies.

28
00:03:24,054 --> 00:03:25,813
- Okay, sure. It was nice to meet you. Bye.
- Bye.

29
00:03:25,884 --> 00:03:26,871
Bye.

30
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:29,072
- You were excellent!
- Thanks, Mom.

31
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,871
Beautiful.

32
00:03:30,945 --> 00:03:32,204
- Dad?
- Beautiful. What?

33
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:33,798
Look, I got fireflies.

34
00:03:33,874 --> 00:03:35,169
- Did you get nervous?
- Oh, look at that.

35
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:36,635
- A little bit.
- Did you?

36
00:03:52,418 --> 00:03:58,139
I may not have your musical
talent, but I try, here and there.

37
00:03:58,211 --> 00:04:00,140
In the shower, I do
all right, don't I?

38
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:03,466
No. That's a very
bad mental image.

39
00:04:06,268 --> 00:04:07,425
Can I keep
them at home?

40
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,657
What's that?

41
00:04:08,765 --> 00:04:09,922
The fireflies?

42
00:04:09,996 --> 00:04:12,425
I don't think so, sweetie.
They might die.

43
00:04:12,494 --> 00:04:13,583
Will they die
in the jar?

44
00:04:13,658 --> 00:04:16,019
No, sweetheart. We just
can't keep them too long.

45
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,915
We'll let them go when
we get home, all right?

46
00:04:17,986 --> 00:04:19,916
We'll let them go.

47
00:04:21,749 --> 00:04:22,872
Here.

48
00:04:31,236 --> 00:04:32,894
- Mommy?
- Yeah?

49
00:04:32,968 --> 00:04:34,522
I need to pee.

50
00:04:34,998 --> 00:04:37,756
Emma, why didn't you go
when we stopped for pizza?

51
00:04:37,829 --> 00:04:38,884
I didn't have
to go then.

52
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:41,321
That's all right. I got to get
some wiper fluid anyways.

53
00:04:41,391 --> 00:04:43,251
Okay.

54
00:04:54,374 --> 00:04:55,396
Quick!

55
00:04:55,473 --> 00:04:56,869
Emma, wait.

56
00:05:13,483 --> 00:05:15,379
You sell wiper fluid?

57
00:05:15,448 --> 00:05:17,435
Yeah, check
the shelf.

58
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:30,259
Shit.

59
00:05:38,818 --> 00:05:41,179
No! No!
Oh, shit!

60
00:05:42,381 --> 00:05:43,539
Josh!

61
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,066
Oh, God!

62
00:05:47,142 --> 00:05:48,538
- Hey!
- Lou!

63
00:05:49,872 --> 00:05:52,062
Josh!
Josh!

64
00:05:52,136 --> 00:05:53,430
Oh, Dad!

65
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,930
Oh, God!
Oh!

66
00:05:56,896 --> 00:05:58,155
Oh, baby!

67
00:05:59,493 --> 00:06:02,921
Wait! Stop!
Wait! Wait!

68
00:06:04,021 --> 00:06:05,178
We're okay.
My eye!

69
00:06:05,252 --> 00:06:06,342
It's okay, baby.

70
00:06:06,417 --> 00:06:07,677
Shh... Shh...
What happened?

71
00:06:07,749 --> 00:06:08,907
Nothing, we hit a log.

72
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,270
You're gonna be all right.
Please don't cry.

73
00:06:12,943 --> 00:06:15,099
- Come on! baby, breathe!
- Ethan!

74
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,161
Breathe.
Come on.

75
00:06:16,238 --> 00:06:17,702
Where's Josh?

76
00:06:18,502 --> 00:06:20,457
- Josh?
- Grace!

77
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:23,590
- Oh, my God!
- No! get back!

78
00:06:23,663 --> 00:06:24,684
Get her in the car!

79
00:06:24,761 --> 00:06:26,385
Daddy, what's wrong?

80
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:30,446
Oh, come back to me.

81
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:31,577
Get in the car!

82
00:06:31,653 --> 00:06:34,377
Please, please, baby,
Come on.

83
00:06:34,848 --> 00:06:35,835
Oh!

84
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:45,565
Dad, my eye! My eye! I know,
I know. Just hang on a second.

85
00:06:45,956 --> 00:06:46,543
Wait here,
I'll be back.

86
00:06:47,065 --> 00:06:48,427
It really hurts.

87
00:06:53,993 --> 00:06:55,518
- Hi, how much for these?
- $1.50.

88
00:06:55,852 --> 00:06:56,874
Here, put these
on your eye.

89
00:06:57,867 --> 00:06:59,371
- Peas! Are you serious?
- Put them on your eye!

90
00:06:59,724 --> 00:07:02,137
No, I'm not putting
cold peas on my eye!

91
00:07:02,424 --> 00:07:04,655
Put them on your eye, Lou.
Don't give me a hard time!

92
00:07:16,194 --> 00:07:19,629
Mr. Learner, our sergeant
would like a word, please.

93
00:07:23,535 --> 00:07:26,301
Are they putting him
in the ambulance?

94
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,955
Is he going to
be all right?

95
00:07:34,491 --> 00:07:35,932
- Momma?
- Huh?

96
00:07:36,796 --> 00:07:38,614
Is he gonna
be okay?

97
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:44,435
Your daddy's
with him.

98
00:07:46,748 --> 00:07:50,507
Mr. Learner? The vehicle
that struck your son

99
00:07:50,579 --> 00:07:53,939
was traveling from that
direction, is that correct, sir?

100
00:07:55,107 --> 00:07:59,148
Sir? Can you describe
the vehicle for me?

101
00:07:59,937 --> 00:08:04,558
Um... It was a truck
or an SUV.

102
00:08:04,632 --> 00:08:06,119
Okay.

103
00:08:06,198 --> 00:08:09,854
Did you happen to recognize
the make or the color?

104
00:08:09,928 --> 00:08:15,378
It was dark...
... blue.

105
00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:22,012
What about the driver, sir?
Could you describe the driver?

106
00:08:22,082 --> 00:08:23,740
I don't know.

107
00:08:24,347 --> 00:08:29,434
He had a hat on, or something
was obscured... I... I...

108
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:31,234
Like a ball cap?

109
00:08:32,872 --> 00:08:34,427
I don't know.

110
00:08:35,737 --> 00:08:37,428
That's all right, sir.

111
00:08:37,501 --> 00:08:39,159
Okay, Mr. Learner.

112
00:08:39,933 --> 00:08:41,954
We can continue this
tomorrow. All right?

113
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,052
I'll get one of my guys
to drive you home.

114
00:08:44,128 --> 00:08:46,183
Wait, what about my son?

115
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:48,717
I don't want
to leave him.

116
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:52,694
Sir, it's a crime scene,
okay? I'll...

117
00:08:52,887 --> 00:08:55,817
I'll be here on your behalf, sir.
I'll stay with your boy the whole time.

118
00:08:55,885 --> 00:08:58,474
See to it that he's treated
with the utmost respect.

119
00:08:58,549 --> 00:09:01,307
You have a wife
and a little girl, sir.

120
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:05,771
It's important that you go
home now and be with them.

121
00:09:12,136 --> 00:09:13,725
Is she okay?

122
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:15,561
Where are we going?

123
00:09:17,664 --> 00:09:20,388
- We have to go home.
- We're going home?

124
00:09:21,194 --> 00:09:24,407
No...
We're going home?

125
00:09:27,547 --> 00:09:28,513
Please don't cry.

126
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:43,604
Norris, they're here!

127
00:09:51,974 --> 00:09:53,428
Where have you been?

128
00:09:53,716 --> 00:09:55,048
Calm down, Ruth.

129
00:09:56,128 --> 00:09:58,751
- Oh, my God! Come here, sweetheart.
- I'm all right, Mom.

130
00:09:58,826 --> 00:10:01,551
What happened to you? Oh, my
God, Lucas! He's... He's...

131
00:10:01,623 --> 00:10:05,983
Sweetheart, let me see that.
How did you do this?

132
00:10:06,052 --> 00:10:09,072
There was a log in the road
and we came around a bend

133
00:10:09,149 --> 00:10:12,408
and we hit the log and then
his head hit the dashboard.

134
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:13,774
Why wasn't he wearing
his seatbelt?

135
00:10:13,845 --> 00:10:15,105
He was wearing his seatbelt.
Sorry, Mom.

136
00:10:15,177 --> 00:10:16,937
I took it off
to change the radio station.

137
00:10:17,009 --> 00:10:19,666
I didn't know he took it off. I
would have told him to put it back on.

138
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:21,329
Oh, sweetheart, let me see.
Can you open your eye?

139
00:10:21,404 --> 00:10:22,959
- No, it hurts.
- Oh.

140
00:10:23,036 --> 00:10:25,859
- Look at his eye, Norris.
- Let me see that.

141
00:10:25,894 --> 00:10:29,196
- Look, he can't even open it.
- Oh, my God! What happened?

142
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,938
So where were you?

143
00:10:31,012 --> 00:10:33,033
We were at a game,
the game ran late!

144
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:35,300
You know, one month
you have him for visitation,

145
00:10:35,374 --> 00:10:38,531
just one month, and you
bring him home like this!

146
00:10:38,603 --> 00:10:40,897
Every time I cut you some
slack, you mess it up!

147
00:10:40,967 --> 00:10:43,261
You cut me some slack? You're
calling me every ten minutes

148
00:10:43,332 --> 00:10:44,852
every time I take him
out of the house!

149
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:45,986
- All right!
- Give me a goddamn break!

150
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:48,616
You don't want anymore bother from
me? Okay! We'll go back to court!

151
00:10:48,692 --> 00:10:49,414
- Threats. More threats.
- Hey, please.

152
00:10:49,491 --> 00:10:51,140
Everybody take a step back.

153
00:10:52,488 --> 00:10:55,882
Christ! You have no idea
what you've done to me.

154
00:10:56,984 --> 00:10:58,278
Let's get that
cleaned up.

155
00:10:58,349 --> 00:11:00,539
Hey, Lou, you okay?

156
00:11:00,613 --> 00:11:03,099
Yeah, Dad. I'll see
you next week.

157
00:11:03,576 --> 00:11:04,870
Yeah.

158
00:11:12,566 --> 00:11:14,000
Can you get the door?

159
00:11:14,364 --> 00:11:16,657
It's okay, honey,
we're home now.

160
00:11:35,641 --> 00:11:37,627
Information.
What state, please?

161
00:11:37,705 --> 00:11:39,532
- Connecticut.
- What listing?

162
00:11:39,603 --> 00:11:42,294
A police station in
Windham Harbor, please.

163
00:11:42,366 --> 00:11:44,126
One moment, please.

164
00:12:07,406 --> 00:12:10,233
I need you to be a brave
girl for me, Emma.

165
00:12:11,135 --> 00:12:13,156
Josh isn't coming home.

166
00:12:15,065 --> 00:12:18,459
He's not coming home?
Never?

167
00:12:20,059 --> 00:12:22,352
He's with the angels now.

168
00:12:24,887 --> 00:12:26,783
- Where's Mommy?
- No, come here.

169
00:12:26,851 --> 00:12:28,009
Mommy!

170
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:33,604
Mommy! Where's Mommy?

171
00:13:22,057 --> 00:13:23,850
<i>It's sunny in Windham Harbor.</i>

172
00:13:23,922 --> 00:13:26,442
<i>Temperature-wise,
up to 72 degrees.</i>

173
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,812
<i>Winds from the northeast
of eight miles per hour.</i>

174
00:13:28,883 --> 00:13:30,937
<i>Clear skies
for the rest of the day.</i>

175
00:13:31,014 --> 00:13:35,737
<i>Tonight, expect a low in the mid-50's,
with clear skies throughout the night.</i>

176
00:13:38,106 --> 00:13:40,550
<i>It's 7: 00 a. m.
Now for the local news.</i>

177
00:13:40,585 --> 00:13:44,139
<i>Connecticut state troopers are
investigating a fatal hit-and-run accident</i>

178
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:47,802
<i>on Reservation Road outside
Windham Harbor last night.</i>

179
00:13:47,877 --> 00:13:49,738
<i>The victim
was a 10-year-old boy.</i>

180
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:54,100
<i>State Police are anxious to talk
to the driver of a dark-colored SUV.</i>

181
00:13:54,171 --> 00:13:56,998
<i>And they appeal to anyone who
may have been on Reservation Road</i>

182
00:13:57,067 --> 00:13:59,962
<i>between 8:45 and 9: 15 p. m.</i>

183
00:15:18,509 --> 00:15:21,523
- Where're you going?
- I have to see the police and pick up the car.

184
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,099
Can't they bring it here?

185
00:15:24,641 --> 00:15:26,968
I need to talk
to them anyways.

186
00:15:29,235 --> 00:15:31,664
Your mom should
be here soon.

187
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:39,661
Don't be long.

188
00:15:39,735 --> 00:15:40,961
I won't.

189
00:15:41,966 --> 00:15:43,555
I love you.

190
00:15:53,785 --> 00:15:55,272
16 Bridge Street.

191
00:16:13,295 --> 00:16:14,282
Thank you.

192
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:17,084
All right, get the
other side. Ready?

193
00:16:21,732 --> 00:16:22,991
Did you catch him?

194
00:16:23,064 --> 00:16:25,220
No, sir, not yet,
I'm afraid.

195
00:16:25,294 --> 00:16:28,222
'Cause I saw
an SUV out there.

196
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,777
There. Right, there,
up on that truck.

197
00:16:29,855 --> 00:16:32,716
Oh, no. That's been there
since Saturday.

198
00:16:32,785 --> 00:16:33,840
Right here, sir.

199
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:36,004
Right there on that
chair right there.

200
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,305
But is that the
make, though?

201
00:16:38,777 --> 00:16:42,261
Well, yeah. I mean,
dark, same shape.

202
00:16:47,977 --> 00:16:49,565
Keep the change.

203
00:16:57,232 --> 00:16:58,423
Hey.

204
00:16:59,829 --> 00:17:01,292
Hey, Dwight.

205
00:17:04,822 --> 00:17:06,150
Dwight.

206
00:17:07,253 --> 00:17:08,478
Yeah?

207
00:17:08,551 --> 00:17:10,242
Yeah, were you in
court this morning?

208
00:17:10,315 --> 00:17:12,936
No, the transmission went
on the Explorer,

209
00:17:13,011 --> 00:17:15,667
so I spent the morning
dealing with that.

210
00:17:15,741 --> 00:17:17,966
How'd it go
this weekend?

211
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:20,093
This weekend?
It was okay.

212
00:17:20,834 --> 00:17:22,264
- Hey, Donna.
- Hey, Dwight.

213
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,320
Yeah, why?

214
00:17:23,398 --> 00:17:24,488
Ruth called.

215
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:27,254
Said you were late,
you were belligerent,

216
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:29,290
and that you dropped
Lucas off with a black eye?

217
00:17:29,357 --> 00:17:32,477
Did she happen to tell you that we were
at the game and it went extra innings,

218
00:17:32,552 --> 00:17:35,514
so we were rushing home and that's
when the transmission seized up,

219
00:17:35,582 --> 00:17:38,567
so poor Lucas hit his
eye on the dashboard.

220
00:17:38,645 --> 00:17:40,166
I mean... And then...
So we show up at her place,

221
00:17:40,243 --> 00:17:42,603
and she's having some kind of
a shit fit. You know how she is.

222
00:17:42,673 --> 00:17:45,431
Look, buddy, you can't get
into any situations with her.

223
00:17:45,502 --> 00:17:48,952
If she drags you in front of a judge again,
you're screwed. You lose your sleepover.

224
00:17:49,031 --> 00:17:50,654
You're right.

225
00:17:51,195 --> 00:17:53,851
Nora Fannelli's in
the waiting room.

226
00:17:53,925 --> 00:17:55,082
Fuck.

227
00:18:04,927 --> 00:18:07,015
Hi, Nora, how are you?

228
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:10,416
Bored. I have been
waiting for 40 minutes.

229
00:18:10,487 --> 00:18:13,540
Yeah, sorry. I had some
trouble this morning.

230
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,800
You look good.

231
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,899
Have you lost
some weight?

232
00:18:25,769 --> 00:18:28,440
Except for the color,
they're all so...

233
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:30,476
similar.

234
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:33,658
It just happened so fast.

235
00:18:34,702 --> 00:18:37,187
That's okay, sir,
take your time.

236
00:18:37,930 --> 00:18:40,484
I'm sure
it will come back to you.

237
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,282
We investigated the crash site and
we collected a variety of items.

238
00:18:44,355 --> 00:18:47,146
Perhaps some of
those may help us.

239
00:19:01,033 --> 00:19:03,552
Do you recognize
that jar, sir?

240
00:19:05,493 --> 00:19:07,218
It's a peanut jar.

241
00:19:09,121 --> 00:19:11,550
Josh collected
fireflies in it.

242
00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:15,940
Do you think that's maybe why he
got out of your vehicle, Mr. Learner?

243
00:19:16,012 --> 00:19:17,998
To collect fireflies?

244
00:19:22,537 --> 00:19:24,262
To let them go.

245
00:19:33,121 --> 00:19:36,742
Dwight, your taxi's here to take
you to the car rental office.

246
00:19:50,332 --> 00:19:52,261
I don't want to
do this, Grandma.

247
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:54,417
Oh, come on.
Sure you do.

248
00:19:55,624 --> 00:19:57,678
- Hey, Dad.
- Hey, baby.

249
00:19:58,587 --> 00:20:00,641
- How are you?
- I'm good.

250
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,239
Ethan.

251
00:20:02,315 --> 00:20:05,708
Oh, I'm so sorry.
My poor daughter.

252
00:20:06,908 --> 00:20:08,735
I'm glad you're here.

253
00:20:09,739 --> 00:20:12,428
No, no, baby. You stay
with me. Come on.

254
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:14,760
Okay. We'll play
some more, all right?

255
00:20:14,832 --> 00:20:16,852
All right. Okay.
Okay.

256
00:20:17,494 --> 00:20:19,015
- Is it my turn?
- Yeah.

257
00:20:22,154 --> 00:20:23,244
Hey.

258
00:20:27,022 --> 00:20:29,281
They get anyone?

259
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,441
They don't have
anything yet.

260
00:20:31,517 --> 00:20:32,503
Not anything?

261
00:20:32,581 --> 00:20:33,772
Nothing.

262
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:42,233
Did you remember
anything else?

263
00:20:45,132 --> 00:20:46,324
No.

264
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:48,425
Perhaps...

265
00:20:49,693 --> 00:20:50,782
I didn't have...

266
00:20:50,858 --> 00:20:53,117
I looked at the makes
of some cars

267
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:57,272
and they said they sent
some stuff into forensics

268
00:20:57,349 --> 00:20:59,245
and in a few days...

269
00:21:01,801 --> 00:21:04,423
Do you know why
he got out of the car?

270
00:21:13,883 --> 00:21:15,642
Ethan?
What?

271
00:21:16,746 --> 00:21:19,174
Let's not think
about it, Grace.

272
00:21:20,574 --> 00:21:21,731
Ethan?

273
00:21:21,806 --> 00:21:23,429
What do you want
to know, Grace?

274
00:21:27,397 --> 00:21:30,086
Why'd he get out
of the car, Ethan?

275
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:34,850
They found the peanut
jar in the bushes.

276
00:21:37,616 --> 00:21:39,771
- Oh, Jesus!
- I know.

277
00:21:39,845 --> 00:21:41,331
Oh, Jesus.

278
00:21:41,443 --> 00:21:43,668
- Oh, Jesus!
- Grace, come here.

279
00:21:43,739 --> 00:21:46,201
Oh, God!
Come here. Come here.

280
00:21:46,269 --> 00:21:48,357
He was letting
them go?

281
00:21:48,392 --> 00:21:49,260
Yes.

282
00:21:49,335 --> 00:21:52,388
- But, Ethan, I told him!
- No, no, no!

283
00:21:52,465 --> 00:21:54,485
- Ethan, I told him they were gonna die!
- It's not your fault!

284
00:21:54,562 --> 00:21:55,685
Gracie, it's not
your fault!

285
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:57,746
- No, no, no!
- What's happening?

286
00:21:57,824 --> 00:21:59,344
- Take Emma.
- Ethan!

287
00:21:59,421 --> 00:22:01,475
- Grace.
- Oh, God!

288
00:22:01,552 --> 00:22:03,175
Come here, baby.

289
00:22:03,249 --> 00:22:04,372
Come on.

290
00:22:04,448 --> 00:22:06,434
Momma's gonna be
all right, okay?

291
00:22:06,511 --> 00:22:08,531
Come on, baby.
Come on.

292
00:22:46,921 --> 00:22:50,280
I'll get through
tomorrow, I promise.

293
00:22:50,350 --> 00:22:53,210
I'll be beside you
every moment. Okay?

294
00:22:58,272 --> 00:22:59,633
Come here.

295
00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:02,825
We're gonna get
through this together.

296
00:23:07,618 --> 00:23:10,341
I keep trying to figure out
what I did to make this happen.

297
00:23:10,414 --> 00:23:11,605
Don't.

298
00:23:14,607 --> 00:23:15,798
I'm so sorry.

299
00:23:15,872 --> 00:23:19,095
No, Grace, you
didn't do anything.

300
00:23:20,531 --> 00:23:22,686
Come on. Come on.
Come here.

301
00:23:24,925 --> 00:23:26,252
It's okay.

302
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:28,017
Come here.

303
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:37,499
And the loss of Josh has
touched the hearts of us all.

304
00:23:40,101 --> 00:23:45,525
Ethan, Grace
and Emma,

305
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:49,248
your Josh is
an angel now.

306
00:23:50,884 --> 00:23:55,276
And for all of us, he will
remain forever young.

307
00:23:56,489 --> 00:24:02,878
Josh was a beautiful cellist
and today, his fellow cellists

308
00:24:04,111 --> 00:24:08,299
and his music teacher, Ruth
Wheldon, will play for him.

309
00:24:51,973 --> 00:24:53,766
Oh, Jesus Christ!

310
00:25:38,938 --> 00:25:42,093
So how has this affected
the coverage of the war?

311
00:25:42,166 --> 00:25:46,649
The cable news channels and your
politicians have you Americans deluded.

312
00:25:46,727 --> 00:25:47,985
How so, Kambiz?

313
00:25:48,057 --> 00:25:51,745
Well, they make you believe you're a
warrior nation with an invincible army.

314
00:25:51,819 --> 00:25:55,144
I mean, your machinery is tough,
but this country has grown soft.

315
00:25:55,214 --> 00:25:57,698
That's bullshit. I mean, we're
fighting terrorism all over the world.

316
00:25:57,776 --> 00:25:59,501
We've never
been stronger.

317
00:25:59,574 --> 00:26:00,697
You're from
Connecticut.

318
00:26:00,772 --> 00:26:04,392
One of the most affluent,
comfortable, safe places in the world.

319
00:26:04,467 --> 00:26:06,327
My people, like the
rest of the world,

320
00:26:06,397 --> 00:26:10,289
they come from a place... They know about
pain and suffering, violence and loss.

321
00:26:10,706 --> 00:26:14,155
Are you saying that Persians and
Africans feel pain differently from us?

322
00:26:14,234 --> 00:26:16,923
I'm saying these
people live with pain

323
00:26:16,996 --> 00:26:18,357
and death every day.
You don't.

324
00:26:18,427 --> 00:26:19,755
You have
become soft.

325
00:26:19,825 --> 00:26:24,080
It's about economics. Poor
African-Americans, poor Hispanics aren't soft.

326
00:26:24,152 --> 00:26:25,978
We go through
the same pain.

327
00:26:26,049 --> 00:26:29,941
I agree. But most Americans
are insulated from death.

328
00:26:41,391 --> 00:26:42,911
- I'm sorry, Professor.
- No disrespect.

329
00:26:42,989 --> 00:26:46,212
No. It's a perfectly
valid point.

330
00:26:47,083 --> 00:26:51,168
So you're suggesting that the media
is in collusion with the politicians?

331
00:27:11,477 --> 00:27:12,736
Hey, boy.

332
00:27:14,407 --> 00:27:16,528
Hi, Mr. Learner. Your wife's
getting me a cup of coffee.

333
00:27:16,603 --> 00:27:18,089
Oh, good.
How are you?

334
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:21,424
Fine. I brought some
items. Your son's clothes.

335
00:27:25,073 --> 00:27:26,763
I forgot to ask
if you wanted milk.

336
00:27:26,836 --> 00:27:28,725
No, black is fine. Thank you.
Thank you very much.

337
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:37,780
Well, we've made
some progress.

338
00:27:38,549 --> 00:27:41,527
We've determined that the SUV
was fitted with a grill guard.

339
00:27:42,276 --> 00:27:44,368
How do you
know that?

340
00:27:44,439 --> 00:27:47,127
The autopsy indicates
a grill guard.

341
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:54,650
Josh suffered a severe blow to his
rib cage, which fractured several ribs.

342
00:27:55,453 --> 00:27:59,179
Unfortunately, one of them
pierced his heart.

343
00:27:59,246 --> 00:28:01,897
He died instantly.
There was no pain.

344
00:28:04,537 --> 00:28:08,322
So you're looking for
a dark SUV with a grill guard.

345
00:28:08,397 --> 00:28:10,881
- Anything more?
- How do you know?

346
00:28:13,424 --> 00:28:16,147
How do you know...
that there was no pain?

347
00:28:17,517 --> 00:28:19,706
Medical examiner
assured me.

348
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:26,992
So the grill guard certainly narrows
our choices down considerably.

349
00:28:27,067 --> 00:28:29,789
We've also canvassed the area and
we set up checkpoints last night.

350
00:28:29,862 --> 00:28:31,224
But it's been a week now.

351
00:28:31,293 --> 00:28:32,723
Yeah, that's the
point exactly.

352
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:34,379
See, people
are creatures of habit.

353
00:28:34,455 --> 00:28:38,006
And we're hoping that someone who
travels that way may pass by there again

354
00:28:38,082 --> 00:28:39,840
and may have some
information to offer to us.

355
00:28:39,912 --> 00:28:43,894
But nothing yet? I mean,
he could be out of the state.

356
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:47,591
Have you contacted out of
state authorities as well, or...

357
00:28:47,665 --> 00:28:49,957
What will happen to
him if you catch him?

358
00:28:50,027 --> 00:28:52,750
Well, he'll be prosecuted
to the full extent of the law.

359
00:28:52,823 --> 00:28:54,452
Which is what?

360
00:28:54,819 --> 00:28:56,612
Well, depending on
the circumstances,

361
00:28:56,683 --> 00:28:59,236
he could get as
much as 10 years.

362
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:05,699
Ten years...

363
00:29:11,512 --> 00:29:14,670
What does "Depending on
the circumstances" mean?

364
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,026
Well, a judge will take
certain sentencing criteria

365
00:29:18,101 --> 00:29:21,187
into account before
he assesses a sentence.

366
00:29:21,262 --> 00:29:23,690
There's a variety of factors
that would come into play.

367
00:29:23,758 --> 00:29:27,207
Sergeant Burke, how many of
these killers do you catch?

368
00:29:28,239 --> 00:29:30,700
I don't know the answer
to that, Mr. Learner.

369
00:29:30,768 --> 00:29:32,963
But I can find out.

370
00:30:15,326 --> 00:30:16,983
She's asleep now.

371
00:30:18,188 --> 00:30:20,547
Honey, I'm looking
up state laws.

372
00:30:20,617 --> 00:30:22,580
There seem to be
so many legal loopholes.

373
00:30:22,647 --> 00:30:25,838
I don't know how
one makes sense of this.

374
00:30:28,404 --> 00:30:31,161
I think we're gonna
need some help.

375
00:30:38,986 --> 00:30:42,378
Can you get some groceries
tomorrow on your way home?

376
00:30:42,979 --> 00:30:44,533
Sure.

377
00:30:46,108 --> 00:30:48,898
You have to leave the
house soon, Grace.

378
00:30:49,768 --> 00:30:51,095
I can't.

379
00:30:52,730 --> 00:30:53,955
Not yet.

380
00:31:00,051 --> 00:31:01,174
Okay.

381
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:08,630
Let's go to bed.

382
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:10,890
Okay.

383
00:31:26,606 --> 00:31:28,160
Hey, Donna, do I
have any messages?

384
00:31:28,236 --> 00:31:29,859
Dwight.
Hey.

385
00:31:30,932 --> 00:31:31,987
Have you got a minute?

386
00:31:32,063 --> 00:31:33,186
Yeah.

387
00:31:37,521 --> 00:31:40,414
This is
Professor Ethan Learner.

388
00:31:40,483 --> 00:31:42,944
Good afternoon. Ethan.
My associate, Dwight Arno.

389
00:31:43,012 --> 00:31:44,236
Afternoon.

390
00:31:44,309 --> 00:31:48,287
Ethan lost his son last week
in that awful hit-and-run.

391
00:31:48,602 --> 00:31:50,689
I'm sure you
heard about it.

392
00:31:50,765 --> 00:31:53,555
Yeah, yeah, I did.
I'm sorry about that.

393
00:31:55,191 --> 00:31:56,586
Thank you.

394
00:31:56,655 --> 00:31:58,844
And he feels he
needs our help.

395
00:31:59,118 --> 00:32:01,207
Okay, sure.

396
00:32:01,514 --> 00:32:05,304
Well, it's been over a week
and the police have nothing,

397
00:32:05,374 --> 00:32:08,459
or they aren't telling us
if they have anything.

398
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,654
This is an initial report.

399
00:32:16,056 --> 00:32:18,813
I want you guys
to stay on top of them.

400
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,218
I want this man found...

401
00:32:23,415 --> 00:32:26,199
and I want him prosecuted
... for homicide.

402
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,912
Did you see him?

403
00:32:32,652 --> 00:32:34,512
For an instant.

404
00:32:34,582 --> 00:32:37,565
Could you give a
description of him?

405
00:32:37,776 --> 00:32:39,670
I don't know. I...

406
00:32:41,036 --> 00:32:44,326
If I saw a photo, maybe
I would... I think...

407
00:32:45,429 --> 00:32:51,010
Okay. Look, right now our job is to stay
on top of the State Police, DA's office.

408
00:32:51,085 --> 00:32:52,605
Light a fire
under their ass.

409
00:32:52,681 --> 00:32:56,039
Make sure they prosecute the case
properly and as quickly as possible.

410
00:32:56,109 --> 00:32:58,695
You might also want to
think about a civil suit.

411
00:32:58,771 --> 00:33:01,130
Which would
entail what?

412
00:33:03,462 --> 00:33:08,511
A civil suit would be a suit that you
would take out as sort of a punitive move

413
00:33:08,586 --> 00:33:12,943
against the person
who... who...

414
00:33:13,011 --> 00:33:14,497
The perpetrator.

415
00:33:14,814 --> 00:33:16,175
Perpetrator.

416
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:20,963
You'd file a civil suit against the
perpetrator for financial remuneration.

417
00:33:22,931 --> 00:33:28,252
Also, you mentioned that your son was
struck by the grill guard of the vehicle.

418
00:33:28,987 --> 00:33:32,141
I'm sorry to bring it up, but a suit should
be brought up against the manufacturer.

419
00:33:32,213 --> 00:33:36,570
Those things are dangerous. They're for
cattle ranches, not our city streets.

420
00:33:38,635 --> 00:33:41,062
So we'll get all the relevant
details from the police department,

421
00:33:41,131 --> 00:33:43,025
from the coroner's office,

422
00:33:43,093 --> 00:33:47,279
and I think Donna has all your
contact information, is that right?

423
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:49,105
Yes.

424
00:33:49,181 --> 00:33:50,735
Okay. Here
are our cards.

425
00:33:50,811 --> 00:33:53,999
When we get all the
information, we'll reconvene.

426
00:33:54,072 --> 00:33:57,226
Dwight here will be handling all
the day-to-day details of the case.

427
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:00,317
So if you need to talk
to anybody, anytime,

428
00:34:00,394 --> 00:34:03,320
call Dwight.
I will. Thank you.

429
00:34:03,388 --> 00:34:04,941
Sure.

430
00:34:05,018 --> 00:34:07,774
Thanks for taking the time.
Absolutely.

431
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:11,102
Listen, I just really want to express
how sorry we are for your loss...

432
00:34:11,173 --> 00:34:14,621
Thanks, thanks... and we'll
take care of everything.

433
00:34:15,997 --> 00:34:18,356
What the fuck is
wrong with you?

434
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,878
Oh, hey, there's
your mom!

435
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:43,105
- Oh, hey.
- Sorry, I'm late.

436
00:34:43,179 --> 00:34:45,039
No problem.

437
00:34:45,109 --> 00:34:46,901
Sorry, sweetheart.

438
00:34:48,668 --> 00:34:51,289
Emma did such a great job today.
I wish you could have heard her.

439
00:34:51,364 --> 00:34:52,725
Oh, me too.

440
00:34:53,326 --> 00:34:54,812
- I'll be right back.
- Where are you going?

441
00:34:54,890 --> 00:34:57,114
- I have to give a book back.
- Okay.

442
00:34:57,186 --> 00:34:59,908
Emma shows so much
promise on the piano.

443
00:35:00,579 --> 00:35:03,335
I would love to put her in the
school concert in a couple of weeks.

444
00:35:03,408 --> 00:35:07,060
And I'd be willing to offer her some
free tutoring classes after school.

445
00:35:07,134 --> 00:35:08,926
Oh, right, you don't
have to do that.

446
00:35:08,996 --> 00:35:10,687
Oh, I'd love to.

447
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:15,706
You know, maybe it will take her
mind off things. If that's okay.

448
00:35:15,784 --> 00:35:17,440
Well, why don't
I ask her?

449
00:35:18,453 --> 00:35:19,542
Of course.

450
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:22,169
And we'll talk about it. Thanks,
it's very generous of you.

451
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,468
- Sure. See you. Bye.
- Thanks for sitting with her.

452
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:25,867
Play that piece for your mom.

453
00:35:25,936 --> 00:35:27,592
Okay, I will.

454
00:35:29,196 --> 00:35:31,316
- You were late.
- Sorry.

455
00:35:32,356 --> 00:35:36,212
Listen, Mrs. Wheldon
was wondering

456
00:35:36,281 --> 00:35:38,708
if you'd like to play
in the school concert.

457
00:35:39,207 --> 00:35:41,276
Maybe practice with
her after school.

458
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:44,471
You don't have to do anything
you don't want to do.

459
00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:47,693
Can you hear music
if you're in heaven?

460
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:52,138
Yes.

461
00:35:52,745 --> 00:35:55,229
Okay, then.
I'll do it.

462
00:36:08,343 --> 00:36:11,236
<i>This is the Red Sox year!</i>

463
00:36:11,305 --> 00:36:14,531
<i>We are going to see the end
of the curse of the Bambino.</i>

464
00:36:14,597 --> 00:36:15,783
What did I tell you?

465
00:36:15,862 --> 00:36:18,187
<i>Let's look at
last week's play.</i>

466
00:36:24,177 --> 00:36:25,962
- How you doing?
- Mr. Arno?

467
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,651
Do you own a 1998
Ford Explorer?

468
00:36:29,233 --> 00:36:32,617
No, I, uh...
What's this about?

469
00:36:33,656 --> 00:36:34,849
Routine investigation.

470
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:36,606
We're checking on
those types of vehicles.

471
00:36:36,783 --> 00:36:40,499
Well, I had that car and then
the transmission went.

472
00:36:40,575 --> 00:36:43,058
So I gave it to one of those
charities. Cancer, I think.

473
00:36:43,137 --> 00:36:45,728
But I haven't gotten a
receipt from those guys yet.

474
00:36:46,328 --> 00:36:47,788
- Dad?
- Yeah?

475
00:36:48,081 --> 00:36:49,237
Is everything
all right?

476
00:36:49,312 --> 00:36:51,795
Yeah, yeah, it's fine.
Go on, I'll be in in a minute.

477
00:36:54,268 --> 00:36:57,387
You turn the plates in yet?
- No, I actually...

478
00:36:57,463 --> 00:37:00,650
Oh, God, I took them to work
and I just haven't had a chance

479
00:37:00,723 --> 00:37:02,480
to get them out
to you guys.

480
00:37:02,552 --> 00:37:03,709
You better mail
them in.

481
00:37:03,782 --> 00:37:05,007
- All right.
- I need to account for it.

482
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:06,407
All right. Thank you,
Officer Murphy.

483
00:37:06,477 --> 00:37:08,099
- Thank you.
- Sure.

484
00:37:09,371 --> 00:37:11,334
- This your new car?
- Huh?

485
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:15,620
Oh, no, it's a rental. I'm just using it
until I figure out what I'm gonna buy.

486
00:37:15,692 --> 00:37:17,518
Better move it
in the garage.

487
00:37:17,589 --> 00:37:20,515
That bird shit will
corrode the finish.

488
00:37:20,582 --> 00:37:22,907
Yeah, you're right.
Thank you.

489
00:37:30,262 --> 00:37:31,385
Are you in trouble?

490
00:37:31,460 --> 00:37:33,784
Huh? No. I just forgot
to fill out some forms.

491
00:37:33,855 --> 00:37:36,509
It won't get any better than
it is right now for the Red Sox.

492
00:37:36,583 --> 00:37:38,341
What's he
saying?

493
00:37:38,412 --> 00:37:41,237
He's talking about the series
and some highlights.

494
00:37:41,685 --> 00:37:43,976
Who does he say
is gonna win?

495
00:37:44,047 --> 00:37:47,528
You kidding me? The Red Sox,
what else would they say?

496
00:37:54,291 --> 00:37:56,979
People keep saying you
need to find closure.

497
00:37:57,052 --> 00:37:59,104
There is no
closure.

498
00:37:59,181 --> 00:38:04,350
There's only acceptance
and resignation.

499
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:09,204
She was going to be
a pediatric surgeon.

500
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:12,981
The judge kept
postponing the case

501
00:38:13,051 --> 00:38:16,873
and meanwhile, this animal
was out on $5000 bail.

502
00:38:20,203 --> 00:38:22,924
Well, the cop who led the investigation
knew. He said it afterwards.

503
00:38:22,996 --> 00:38:27,181
He told me, "You'll get no justice in
the courts. All you'll get is the law. "

504
00:38:27,254 --> 00:38:30,973
I'll never forget those words.
There's no justice in the court system.

505
00:38:31,046 --> 00:38:32,871
There's only the law.

506
00:38:33,773 --> 00:38:35,429
Get the light.

507
00:38:35,503 --> 00:38:36,931
Come on.

508
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,123
Game's on soon.

509
00:38:38,197 --> 00:38:41,849
Grab some of those paper plates
out of the cupboard there.

510
00:38:46,313 --> 00:38:48,104
Are you having fries?

511
00:38:50,404 --> 00:38:51,526
Dad?

512
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,323
Yeah?

513
00:38:55,153 --> 00:38:58,112
I got suspended from
school for three days.

514
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,134
Why?

515
00:39:02,204 --> 00:39:06,388
I got into a fight with Paulie
Ferrari and he had to have stitches.

516
00:39:07,293 --> 00:39:08,550
Stitches?
How many?

517
00:39:08,622 --> 00:39:09,778
Six, I think.

518
00:39:10,784 --> 00:39:12,337
God damn it, Lou! What
the hell's wrong with you?

519
00:39:12,414 --> 00:39:13,672
Are you an idiot?

520
00:39:13,745 --> 00:39:16,296
What do you mean you
gave him stitches? Huh?

521
00:39:16,372 --> 00:39:18,992
- What is wrong with you?
- Stop yelling!

522
00:39:23,023 --> 00:39:24,486
All right.

523
00:39:25,385 --> 00:39:28,276
All right, I'm sorry,
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

524
00:39:28,778 --> 00:39:31,136
Sit down, tell me
what happened.

525
00:39:32,203 --> 00:39:34,425
The three of us
were in the hallway

526
00:39:34,498 --> 00:39:37,888
and Paulie had a water
balloon in his hand

527
00:39:37,957 --> 00:39:42,742
and he threw it at Benny, but it
hit Ms. Swanson, our math teacher.

528
00:39:42,812 --> 00:39:46,259
And she wanted to know who threw
it, but Paulie just wouldn't own up.

529
00:39:46,338 --> 00:39:47,528
Okay.

530
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:51,350
So we all had to have
after-school detention.

531
00:39:52,657 --> 00:39:55,209
All right, so how did
you get into a fight?

532
00:39:55,274 --> 00:39:57,099
I was calling him
a no-good coward.

533
00:39:57,170 --> 00:39:59,324
We started
fighting.

534
00:39:59,398 --> 00:40:00,724
Then he hit his head
on the ground.

535
00:40:00,795 --> 00:40:03,086
I don't want you
fighting, Lou.

536
00:40:03,156 --> 00:40:04,619
You and Mom
fight all the time.

537
00:40:04,686 --> 00:40:07,510
I don't care, Luke.
Don't talk back to me.

538
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:09,733
I don't want you fighting.
Look where it got us.

539
00:40:09,808 --> 00:40:13,164
But... But he was a
no-good coward, Dad.

540
00:40:13,234 --> 00:40:14,719
Wasn't he?

541
00:40:16,825 --> 00:40:19,512
I don't care. I don't
care, Lou, okay?

542
00:40:19,586 --> 00:40:22,545
Paulie Ferrari doesn't
need you beating him up

543
00:40:22,612 --> 00:40:25,968
for him to know that he did something
wrong, do you understand me?

544
00:40:26,038 --> 00:40:28,000
What'd your
mother say?

545
00:40:29,564 --> 00:40:31,650
I can't watch
the game.

546
00:40:31,726 --> 00:40:33,449
All right, go to
your room.

547
00:40:33,521 --> 00:40:36,140
Can you just tell me the scores
every once in a while? Please?

548
00:40:36,215 --> 00:40:38,369
Get in your room.

549
00:40:38,444 --> 00:40:39,929
It's not fair.

550
00:40:44,762 --> 00:40:46,916
Come on, Josh,
let's go! Okay.

551
00:40:46,991 --> 00:40:48,249
I love you, Josh.

552
00:40:48,322 --> 00:40:51,802
- I love you too, Dad. Bye!
- Call me when you're done.

553
00:41:58,472 --> 00:42:00,558
What's the score?

554
00:42:00,634 --> 00:42:03,649
Well, you never told me
I couldn't listen.

555
00:42:04,291 --> 00:42:06,750
Six to six.
Bottom of the eighth.

556
00:42:09,112 --> 00:42:11,040
Listen, I want to talk to you
about what you said to me

557
00:42:11,107 --> 00:42:13,431
about me and
your mom fighting.

558
00:42:15,597 --> 00:42:17,218
When I was a little kid,
I thought that...

559
00:42:17,293 --> 00:42:19,345
that's how men and women
behaved toward each other.

560
00:42:19,421 --> 00:42:23,241
Your grandpa had a
pretty bad temper and...

561
00:42:24,276 --> 00:42:26,895
he would fly off the handle
at the smallest things.

562
00:42:26,969 --> 00:42:29,156
Like if his soup was cold,
he'd hit the roof.

563
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:32,416
And I was like you
where I wanted to...

564
00:42:35,315 --> 00:42:37,740
I wanted to step
in between them.

565
00:42:42,863 --> 00:42:48,044
But I knew if I did that he
would... He... He'd hurt me.

566
00:42:52,805 --> 00:42:56,660
And I...
I hated him.

567
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:01,547
And I hated my mom,
for crying all the time.

568
00:43:03,181 --> 00:43:08,124
And I blamed him for a lot of
my problems through my life.

569
00:43:13,654 --> 00:43:18,734
And I just don't want you to
feel that way towards me, ever.

570
00:43:20,404 --> 00:43:22,422
Never, Dad.
Never.

571
00:43:26,523 --> 00:43:29,845
Well, I don't know, Luke.
Sometimes things happen that are...

572
00:43:29,914 --> 00:43:34,064
That are just out
of your control

573
00:43:34,869 --> 00:43:38,792
and you really want to look
around for someone else to blame

574
00:43:38,859 --> 00:43:43,474
and those are the times when you just
really got to stand up and be a man.

575
00:43:47,472 --> 00:43:49,093
Understand?

576
00:43:56,283 --> 00:43:59,038
You wanna go see
who's up to bat?

577
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:00,594
Yeah.
Thanks, Dad.

578
00:44:00,672 --> 00:44:03,393
Hey, hey. That's all
I get is a thanks?

579
00:44:03,465 --> 00:44:05,189
You're the best.

580
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:45,499
Sir, raise your hands and
step out of the vehicle!

581
00:45:52,485 --> 00:45:53,947
I got this.

582
00:45:54,779 --> 00:45:56,864
I'm being arrested
for taking a picture?

583
00:45:56,940 --> 00:45:59,331
Yes. You took photos
of a diplomat's home.

584
00:45:59,399 --> 00:46:01,518
Come here.
Thank you, guys.

585
00:46:03,089 --> 00:46:05,345
- Listen, you can't be doing this.
- Doing what?

586
00:46:05,417 --> 00:46:07,875
Conducting your
own investigation.

587
00:46:07,942 --> 00:46:09,403
No one else is.

588
00:46:09,471 --> 00:46:11,624
That's not true.
Have a seat.

589
00:46:11,699 --> 00:46:13,818
Right here.
Have a seat.

590
00:46:19,078 --> 00:46:20,971
We're canvassing
the area.

591
00:46:21,039 --> 00:46:22,728
We've gone to repair
shops and junkyards.

592
00:46:22,801 --> 00:46:24,920
We're doing everything
we possibly can.

593
00:46:24,996 --> 00:46:28,917
You have to understand, Mr.
Learner, that these things take time.

594
00:46:28,984 --> 00:46:30,673
You didn't need much
time to arrest me.

595
00:46:30,746 --> 00:46:35,166
You practically had a SWAT team
surround me in under five minutes,

596
00:46:35,233 --> 00:46:38,020
but nobody can seem
to find my son's killer!

597
00:46:38,092 --> 00:46:42,138
My son's innocent life
was snuffed out,

598
00:46:43,078 --> 00:46:47,759
and no one seems to
notice or to give a fuck!

599
00:46:47,794 --> 00:46:49,255
That's not true, sir.

600
00:46:49,327 --> 00:46:51,118
We investigated
this vehicle.

601
00:46:51,189 --> 00:46:54,443
It was involved in a fender
bender in the city three days ago.

602
00:46:54,513 --> 00:46:55,873
Diplomatic plates!

603
00:46:55,943 --> 00:46:58,459
These guys can get away with
whatever they want, you know that.

604
00:46:58,537 --> 00:47:01,619
Sir, you know, I think
you need to calm down.

605
00:47:02,392 --> 00:47:04,286
We've been in touch
with your lawyers,

606
00:47:04,354 --> 00:47:08,832
and you have to believe me that I
want this guy just as badly as you do.

607
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:10,665
Then get him.

608
00:47:12,865 --> 00:47:16,481
It was an accident, but what
I did was terribly wrong.

609
00:47:18,417 --> 00:47:21,965
I left that night because
I was afraid of losing you.

610
00:47:23,138 --> 00:47:27,619
And...
that's no excuse.

611
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,278
I'm gonna go
to prison.

612
00:47:34,142 --> 00:47:36,914
And I deserve
to go to prison.

613
00:48:02,018 --> 00:48:05,508
People are gonna talk
behind your back.

614
00:48:06,176 --> 00:48:10,125
They're gonna say
hurtful things,

615
00:48:12,519 --> 00:48:16,724
but I just wanna urge you to remember
these days that we've had together.

616
00:48:17,730 --> 00:48:21,106
I feel like for the first time I've
been able to be the father to you

617
00:48:21,486 --> 00:48:22,524
that you deserve,

618
00:48:24,441 --> 00:48:34,036
and they've really been the
most beautiful days of my life.

619
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:40,953
And I just wanna say
I'm sorry, honey.

620
00:48:41,842 --> 00:48:44,058
I'm sorry and
I love you so much.

621
00:48:44,955 --> 00:48:49,486
And I hope that one day when this is all over that
we'll be able to get back to where we are today.

622
00:48:53,894 --> 00:48:55,123
I love you.

623
00:49:10,787 --> 00:49:11,978
What are you doing?

624
00:49:13,037 --> 00:49:14,317
Hi.

625
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:19,451
I was just looking
at some of this stuff.

626
00:49:20,683 --> 00:49:22,481
I've been trying
to show you this.

627
00:49:26,386 --> 00:49:29,400
That's a chat room of people who
help to track hit-and-run offenders,

628
00:49:29,681 --> 00:49:33,158
drunk drivers, lenient
judges. They're very helpful.

629
00:49:33,602 --> 00:49:34,630
Here, let me
show you this.

630
00:49:37,818 --> 00:49:39,629
I've been looking into
some other possibilities.

631
00:49:40,998 --> 00:49:42,768
What sort of
possibilities?

632
00:49:44,271 --> 00:49:45,302
Of how to
find this guy.

633
00:49:45,763 --> 00:49:47,816
I thought that was why
we got lawyers.

634
00:49:53,225 --> 00:49:54,722
Why are you
doing this?

635
00:49:55,759 --> 00:49:58,358
Because it's been over a month
and no one else is doing anything.

636
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:03,242
Please don't tell me I have to
defend myself to you as well.

637
00:50:03,564 --> 00:50:05,469
- As well as who?
- Everybody!

638
00:50:05,903 --> 00:50:10,155
Everybody I talk to says, "Move on, put it
behind you, let the police deal with it. "

639
00:50:10,429 --> 00:50:11,842
Why? Why do
they say that?

640
00:50:12,636 --> 00:50:14,468
People don't know
what to say.

641
00:50:14,569 --> 00:50:16,653
No. They've given up
on finding this guy

642
00:50:16,946 --> 00:50:18,842
and they want me to
resign myself to the fact

643
00:50:19,085 --> 00:50:20,690
that he's never
gonna be caught!

644
00:50:21,702 --> 00:50:22,978
Why should he
get away with it?

645
00:50:23,259 --> 00:50:24,929
He shouldn't
get away with it.

646
00:50:25,498 --> 00:50:27,587
You think I want him
to get away with it?

647
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:32,841
You've always been
there for us, Ethan.

648
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:36,665
Don't abandon
us now.

649
00:50:38,665 --> 00:50:42,229
That's what you think?
That I've abandoned you?

650
00:50:47,603 --> 00:50:49,587
Dinner's almost
ready.

651
00:50:57,240 --> 00:50:58,464
Yes, sir?

652
00:50:58,536 --> 00:51:01,618
I'm here for the
Josh Learner case.

653
00:51:01,694 --> 00:51:04,678
The boy that was killed
on Reservation Road.

654
00:51:05,250 --> 00:51:06,776
Can I have your
name, sir?

655
00:51:06,811 --> 00:51:08,205
It's Dwight Arno.

656
00:51:08,275 --> 00:51:11,391
I have some important
information concerning...

657
00:51:11,911 --> 00:51:13,837
Hey, Jackie,
where's Emelda?

658
00:51:13,905 --> 00:51:15,627
I need a hand out here!
I'm dying!

659
00:51:15,699 --> 00:51:17,183
She's on her break.
She'll be back in five.

660
00:51:17,261 --> 00:51:19,516
I'll get the case officer
for you, sir.

661
00:51:29,789 --> 00:51:31,250
Mr. Arno.

662
00:51:32,580 --> 00:51:34,903
What took you so long?
Come on.

663
00:51:35,804 --> 00:51:38,727
Steve called a while ago and
said you'd be taking the case.

664
00:51:38,795 --> 00:51:40,516
We're just making sure
that your client doesn't have

665
00:51:40,589 --> 00:51:42,413
a reoccurrence of
the last incident.

666
00:51:42,482 --> 00:51:43,502
Hey, Sarge,
take a look at this.

667
00:51:43,580 --> 00:51:44,939
Last incident?

668
00:51:45,008 --> 00:51:48,395
Yeah, he's going around
photographing damaged SUVs.

669
00:51:48,464 --> 00:51:50,548
He scared the daylights
out of a Saudi diplomat.

670
00:51:50,624 --> 00:51:52,414
Lucky he didn't
get himself shot.

671
00:51:52,485 --> 00:51:56,167
Now he's got it in his head somehow that
the diplomat's involved in the accident

672
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,095
and there's a big cover-up.
It's a total mess.

673
00:51:59,164 --> 00:52:00,954
Sarge, I need you
to sign this report.

674
00:52:01,025 --> 00:52:03,076
Yeah, give
me a minute.

675
00:52:03,194 --> 00:52:05,652
All right, here's the
reality of the case.

676
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:08,541
We're three weeks into it and we
really don't have much to go on.

677
00:52:08,611 --> 00:52:11,228
I got a dark-colored SUV
with a grill guard.

678
00:52:11,303 --> 00:52:13,489
It's like finding a
needle in a haystack.

679
00:52:13,562 --> 00:52:15,579
To be frank with you, if the
guy doesn't walk in the door

680
00:52:15,656 --> 00:52:19,508
and give himself up, I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to back burner it.

681
00:52:19,576 --> 00:52:22,398
I'm hoping you can talk to your
client and help him understand.

682
00:52:22,467 --> 00:52:25,447
Yeah, listen, Sarge, there's something
else I'd like to talk to you about.

683
00:52:25,525 --> 00:52:28,006
Hey, Joe. Can you tell Sergeant
Burke he's got a call from the DA?

684
00:52:28,083 --> 00:52:31,697
I'm so jammed up. Listen, this
is the file. Everything is in it.

685
00:52:31,772 --> 00:52:33,324
The autopsy report
and everything.

686
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:35,055
I'm gonna have one of
my guys copy it for you

687
00:52:35,128 --> 00:52:38,675
and hand it off to you, okay? I
gotta run. Thanks for coming in.

688
00:52:38,750 --> 00:52:41,469
Hey, Callaghan. Can you copy this for
Mr. Arno and give it to him right away?

689
00:52:41,542 --> 00:52:42,562
Yeah, sure
thing, Sarge.

690
00:52:42,638 --> 00:52:44,961
Hey, Joe, what
was that number?

691
00:53:02,609 --> 00:53:04,931
You have one new
voice message.

692
00:53:05,699 --> 00:53:07,591
First voice
message.

693
00:53:07,660 --> 00:53:12,305
Mr. Arno, it's Ethan again. I've
left you a number of messages.

694
00:53:12,379 --> 00:53:13,432
Please call me back
when you can.

695
00:53:13,938 --> 00:53:16,452
Did you get my question about
diplomatic immunity? I wanted to...

696
00:53:32,045 --> 00:53:33,370
Don't...

697
00:53:37,361 --> 00:53:38,946
Yes, uh...

698
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:41,975
You okay?

699
00:53:42,046 --> 00:53:44,798
Yeah. I just
had a dream.

700
00:54:30,419 --> 00:54:33,896
Wait. Just hold on.
Just give me a second.

701
00:54:39,263 --> 00:54:40,451
Shit.

702
00:54:41,123 --> 00:54:42,708
Wanna stop?

703
00:54:46,536 --> 00:54:47,996
It's okay.

704
00:54:51,417 --> 00:54:53,077
Look at me.

705
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:56,427
- Honey?
- What?

706
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,917
Is it me?

707
00:54:59,987 --> 00:55:01,278
What are you
talking about?

708
00:55:04,437 --> 00:55:05,592
Do you blame me?

709
00:55:05,666 --> 00:55:07,625
Oh, Grace, don't
be ridiculous.

710
00:55:08,854 --> 00:55:10,954
- What are you talking about?
- You won't even look at me!

711
00:55:10,989 --> 00:55:13,102
What do you mean
I don't look at you?

712
00:55:17,996 --> 00:55:21,654
- Why can't we just talk about it?
- Oh, come on, this isn't about you!

713
00:55:26,368 --> 00:55:28,225
It's the killer's fault!

714
00:55:28,295 --> 00:55:31,274
It's the son of a bitch
that stole our son away!

715
00:55:32,426 --> 00:55:33,817
That's who's
to blame!

716
00:57:22,647 --> 00:57:22,952
Mommy.

717
00:57:24,101 --> 00:57:24,979
- Mommy.
- What?

718
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,206
What time is it?

719
00:57:28,193 --> 00:57:29,629
Dad's asleep
downstairs.

720
00:57:31,739 --> 00:57:34,261
I'm going to be late and
there's nothing to eat anywhere.

721
00:57:37,299 --> 00:57:39,242
Well, that doesn't sound
very good, does it?

722
00:57:41,479 --> 00:57:42,398
Come here.

723
00:57:49,702 --> 00:57:51,525
Why don't we go down together
and see what we can do?

724
00:57:51,703 --> 00:57:52,593
Okay.

725
00:58:34,624 --> 00:58:35,626
Jake, high five.

726
00:58:36,536 --> 00:58:38,024
Look at that,
he won't do it for me.

727
00:58:38,985 --> 00:58:39,614
High five.

728
00:58:40,715 --> 00:58:43,628
It's amazing. You know the only
one he did that for was my son.

729
00:58:52,374 --> 00:58:53,684
Hey, Dad!
Dad!

730
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,634
Yeah?

731
00:58:56,744 --> 00:58:57,687
Where're you
going?

732
00:59:03,948 --> 00:59:06,185
- Hey.
- You forgot where I live?

733
00:59:06,705 --> 00:59:10,237
Huh? No, I left my wallet at the
bank, so I was heading back to get it.

734
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,023
Got your books?

735
00:59:12,707 --> 00:59:14,976
- Yeah, I'll go get them.
- Hey, Ethan -Mr. Arno?

736
00:59:17,436 --> 00:59:18,713
What brings
you here?

737
00:59:19,065 --> 00:59:21,313
Oh, my daughter takes piano
lessons from Mrs. Wheldon.

738
00:59:21,738 --> 00:59:23,858
- Oh, yeah, yeah. She's good at that.
- That's your boy?

739
00:59:24,155 --> 00:59:26,982
- Yeah, Ruth's my ex-wife.
- Oh.

740
00:59:27,017 --> 00:59:29,243
Listen, I've left you a number
of messages. Why haven't you...

741
00:59:29,311 --> 00:59:33,059
I'm sorry, you know, I've been out
of the office this last week and...

742
00:59:33,131 --> 00:59:34,852
Well, when would be
a good time to get together

743
00:59:34,923 --> 00:59:37,572
'cause there's some things
I'd like to talk about.

744
00:59:37,647 --> 00:59:41,587
Okay, well, let me talk to Shelly
and we'll try and schedule something.

745
00:59:41,665 --> 00:59:44,777
I'll be around this weekend
as well, so give me a call.

746
00:59:44,852 --> 00:59:48,668
Oh, I got my kid this weekend.
I don't get much time with him.

747
00:59:48,737 --> 00:59:50,859
- Bye, Mr. Learner.
- Bye-bye.

748
00:59:51,124 --> 00:59:52,109
Ok. I'll talk to you.

749
00:59:52,821 --> 00:59:54,338
- Hey baby.
- Bye, Mom.

750
00:59:54,416 --> 00:59:55,435
- See ya Emma
- Bye, Lucas.

751
01:00:00,127 --> 01:00:01,746
I didn't know
you knew Dwight.

752
01:00:02,220 --> 01:00:03,642
Yeah, he's helping me
with some legal stuff.

753
01:00:04,513 --> 01:00:05,762
Good luck
with that.

754
01:00:06,238 --> 01:00:07,355
- All right, you take care.
- Bye.

755
01:00:07,432 --> 01:00:09,386
- See you.
- Bye, Luke.

756
01:00:09,982 --> 01:00:12,732
Come on, honey, we
got to get your mom.

757
01:00:14,562 --> 01:00:17,980
So, your mom's teaching
music lessons again?

758
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:21,488
Just that girl. Her brother
Josh was killed, remember?

759
01:00:21,567 --> 01:00:23,785
In that car crash, the
day we went to Fenway.

760
01:00:23,857 --> 01:00:25,989
No, I don't think it was
the same day, man.

761
01:00:27,311 --> 01:00:28,827
It was like
a week later.

762
01:00:33,517 --> 01:00:35,372
Did you know
that kid?

763
01:00:36,504 --> 01:00:40,552
I saw him around. He was a bit
of a dweeb, but he was nice.

764
01:00:41,416 --> 01:00:42,672
You know
his dad?

765
01:00:42,744 --> 01:00:45,459
Huh? Yeah. I'm doing
some legal work for him.

766
01:00:48,089 --> 01:00:50,013
Did he say
anything about that?

767
01:00:50,080 --> 01:00:51,133
Like what, Dad?

768
01:00:51,209 --> 01:00:52,396
I don't know.

769
01:00:56,420 --> 01:01:00,495
So I was thinking, I don't
know, we get a couple of pies

770
01:01:00,569 --> 01:01:02,221
and some snacks.
What do you think?

771
01:01:02,295 --> 01:01:05,045
Sounds good. But do
you have money?

772
01:01:05,117 --> 01:01:07,969
Why? Did your mom tell you
I don't have any money again?

773
01:01:08,038 --> 01:01:10,924
No, you told me you left
your wallet at the bank.

774
01:01:10,993 --> 01:01:13,708
Oh. No, no, no,
I got some extra cash.

775
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:17,727
Let's go Red Sox.

776
01:01:20,386 --> 01:01:22,038
Okay, sit
down.

777
01:01:27,324 --> 01:01:31,239
Do you think mom would let me
live with you for a little while?

778
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:36,211
I think that's a talk
for another day, buddy.

779
01:01:37,282 --> 01:01:39,862
All right, we're
missing the game.

780
01:01:40,435 --> 01:01:42,155
Come on, guys.

781
01:02:00,816 --> 01:02:03,069
What is this? Wait.
What are you doing?

782
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:04,498
Who said you
could take this?

783
01:02:04,567 --> 01:02:07,679
Hey, hold on a minute.
Who said you could do this?

784
01:02:07,754 --> 01:02:09,010
Grace!

785
01:02:11,704 --> 01:02:13,752
What are you doing?
No, give me this!

786
01:02:13,829 --> 01:02:16,345
- Let him take it.
- No, he can't take this.

787
01:02:16,697 --> 01:02:18,354
Have I no
say in this?

788
01:02:20,347 --> 01:02:21,897
- Sure.
- All of his stuff.

789
01:02:21,973 --> 01:02:24,982
Sure, if you wanna talk to me
now, you can have a say in it.

790
01:02:25,059 --> 01:02:27,241
Maybe you have some advice
for me. Maybe there's a tip...

791
01:02:27,315 --> 01:02:29,532
the Internet that
you found that...

792
01:02:30,114 --> 01:02:32,829
...tells you how to deal
with your dead son's possessions?

793
01:02:33,685 --> 01:02:34,771
- Maybe they say you should keep them...
- What are you talking about?

794
01:02:34,846 --> 01:02:37,561
...hold on to them, so
you can feed your anger.

795
01:02:37,634 --> 01:02:40,880
Why wouldn't I be angry?
Why aren't you angry?

796
01:02:40,952 --> 01:02:43,067
- Here's what I care about!
- Yeah? What?

797
01:02:43,141 --> 01:02:45,121
My son
is dead!

798
01:02:45,199 --> 01:02:49,641
He's not coming
home to me!

799
01:02:49,710 --> 01:02:51,523
I'm trying to figure
out how to live!

800
01:02:52,094 --> 01:02:53,731
How to not
go crazy!

801
01:02:53,766 --> 01:02:56,131
- Well, I'm not gonna live my life knowing...
- How to take care of...

802
01:02:56,207 --> 01:03:00,245
- that our son's killer is still out there!
- the child that we still have!

803
01:03:00,321 --> 01:03:02,142
- That's what I can't live with!
- We have a child!

804
01:03:02,213 --> 01:03:03,604
I don't see why
you can't see that!

805
01:03:03,672 --> 01:03:06,059
She needs looking after
and I need to look after her.

806
01:03:06,129 --> 01:03:09,376
If you can't help me
with that, then you get out!

807
01:03:15,884 --> 01:03:18,497
Good evening, ladies and
gentlemen, girls and boys.

808
01:03:18,572 --> 01:03:20,462
Welcome to our fall concert.

809
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:24,535
We've all worked very hard on
this, and so we hope you enjoy it.

810
01:04:02,009 --> 01:04:06,354
What do you get when you cross
poison ivy with a four-leaf clover?

811
01:04:06,422 --> 01:04:08,175
A rash of
good luck.

812
01:04:08,612 --> 01:04:09,664
That is
correct.

813
01:04:09,740 --> 01:04:12,286
What do you call
a deer with no eyes?

814
01:04:12,361 --> 01:04:13,719
No ideer.

815
01:04:14,883 --> 01:04:17,994
What do you call a deer
with no eyes and no legs?

816
01:04:18,069 --> 01:04:19,721
Still no ideer.

817
01:04:20,425 --> 01:04:22,279
If a man speaks in the
middle of the forest

818
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:25,767
with no woman there to
hear him, is he still wrong?

819
01:04:25,834 --> 01:04:27,021
Yes.

820
01:04:28,124 --> 01:04:29,210
Correct.

821
01:04:29,285 --> 01:04:33,527
If con is the opposite of pro, then
what is the opposite of progress?

822
01:04:35,754 --> 01:04:37,642
Congress!

823
01:04:37,711 --> 01:04:40,221
Ladies and gentlemen,
it is a draw!

824
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:52,797
Our next performer will be
Emma Learner of the fifth grade.

825
01:05:01,191 --> 01:05:03,373
This is for my brother, Josh.

826
01:06:09,377 --> 01:06:12,351
I'm lucky to have such
smart women around me.

827
01:06:51,430 --> 01:06:54,076
It was so,
so beautiful.

828
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:55,303
Thank you, Mom.

829
01:06:55,377 --> 01:06:56,496
Thank you.

830
01:06:56,571 --> 01:06:59,024
You were so good,
baby. Come here.

831
01:07:03,801 --> 01:07:05,654
- Good night, Grace.
- Take care.

832
01:07:05,724 --> 01:07:07,115
Not as good
as you.

833
01:07:07,183 --> 01:07:09,693
So, maestro, what's
the next date?

834
01:07:09,770 --> 01:07:11,851
What, Lincoln Center
or Symphony Space?

835
01:07:11,926 --> 01:07:13,215
- Carnegie Hall?
- Dad, don't be silly.

836
01:07:13,286 --> 01:07:14,710
What? What?
I'm not being silly.

837
01:07:14,778 --> 01:07:17,424
Emma, thank you
so much. Thank you.

838
01:07:17,497 --> 01:07:19,182
You're such
an inspiration.

839
01:07:19,256 --> 01:07:21,268
- Lou!
- You were wonderful.

840
01:07:24,196 --> 01:07:25,417
Lou!

841
01:07:25,490 --> 01:07:26,507
Oh, no,
that's fine.

842
01:07:26,585 --> 01:07:28,767
Our prayers were
with you the entire time.

843
01:07:28,840 --> 01:07:31,350
- Your daughter is great.
- Thank you.

844
01:07:32,289 --> 01:07:35,240
You must be very proud
of Emma tonight.

845
01:07:47,479 --> 01:07:48,733
Hey, Lou!

846
01:08:01,175 --> 01:08:02,294
Lou!

847
01:08:10,958 --> 01:08:12,417
Ethan?

848
01:08:16,697 --> 01:08:21,364
Our composer's waiting. She
wants to go celebrate. What is it?

849
01:08:21,436 --> 01:08:23,651
I just feel
nauseous.

850
01:08:24,816 --> 01:08:26,771
I got you a gift,
all right?

851
01:08:26,838 --> 01:08:27,990
Thanks, Dad.

852
01:08:28,064 --> 01:08:30,143
It's a Red Sox
yearbook.

853
01:08:30,218 --> 01:08:32,003
- I love it.
- Our boy, huh?

854
01:08:32,074 --> 01:08:34,052
- Yeah.
- You were great.

855
01:08:35,289 --> 01:08:37,797
All right.
All right, Norris.

856
01:08:37,874 --> 01:08:40,123
I'll see you, Ruth.
I'll see you Friday, right?

857
01:08:40,193 --> 01:08:42,046
Yeah.
Friday.

858
01:08:42,878 --> 01:08:44,392
You were really
good tonight.

859
01:08:44,469 --> 01:08:45,554
Thanks.

860
01:08:48,446 --> 01:08:50,197
See you.
Bye, Dad.

861
01:09:08,032 --> 01:09:09,083
Hey.

862
01:09:18,140 --> 01:09:20,253
I've been looking for you.

863
01:09:28,348 --> 01:09:30,630
What happened
tonight?

864
01:09:34,147 --> 01:09:35,729
It was good.

865
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,274
We were okay.

866
01:09:41,008 --> 01:09:44,217
We were okay for a
little while, weren't we?

867
01:09:53,834 --> 01:09:56,545
Ethan, I don't know
how to get you back.

868
01:09:58,606 --> 01:10:00,493
Tell me what to do.

869
01:10:02,815 --> 01:10:06,284
What happened?
What happened?

870
01:10:06,361 --> 01:10:07,977
Murder happened.

871
01:10:08,615 --> 01:10:10,502
That's what
happened.

872
01:10:16,039 --> 01:10:17,496
I love you.

873
01:10:19,353 --> 01:10:21,274
And I want
to get help.

874
01:10:23,760 --> 01:10:25,975
I want us
to talk to someone.

875
01:10:28,334 --> 01:10:31,079
Okay. You wanna talk
to somebody, Grace?

876
01:10:31,748 --> 01:10:32,900
We'll talk to
whoever you want.

877
01:10:32,973 --> 01:10:38,635
We can talk to the police, lawyer, a
therapist. I'll talk to the goddamn Pope.

878
01:10:39,767 --> 01:10:41,846
Anything you
want, okay?

879
01:10:45,503 --> 01:10:47,717
Now can I please
be alone?

880
01:10:48,816 --> 01:10:50,827
Okay, Ethan.
Okay.

881
01:11:18,898 --> 01:11:20,117
Hello?

882
01:11:21,084 --> 01:11:22,869
Oh, hi, Mr. Learner.

883
01:11:26,021 --> 01:11:27,941
No, no,
I was running.

884
01:11:29,466 --> 01:11:30,980
Yeah, I'm free.

885
01:11:33,541 --> 01:11:36,151
Yeah, you wanna
meet at the office?

886
01:11:38,335 --> 01:11:39,397
Where?

887
01:12:03,933 --> 01:12:06,512
- Dwight. How are you?
- Mr. Learner.

888
01:12:07,686 --> 01:12:09,189
Nice car.
Is it new?

889
01:12:09,893 --> 01:12:11,637
No. No.
It's a rental.

890
01:12:13,289 --> 01:12:14,472
A rental?

891
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:19,232
Been down
here before?

892
01:12:20,799 --> 01:12:21,642
No, no.

893
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:24,793
Why do you ask?

894
01:12:25,354 --> 01:12:28,062
I just thought maybe you'd come down
and familiarize yourself with the case.

895
01:12:28,867 --> 01:12:32,024
- No. We have a private investigator
who does that. - Yeah

896
01:12:33,930 --> 01:12:37,134
I've been down here a lot,
trying to put it together.

897
01:12:46,173 --> 01:12:47,614
This is where
Josh was hit.

898
01:12:48,810 --> 01:12:51,250
He came over here
to release fireflies.

899
01:12:52,743 --> 01:12:54,016
I guess he was...

900
01:12:55,697 --> 01:12:57,407
...going to the
woods over there.

901
01:13:00,849 --> 01:13:03,481
And then from around
the bend... Here, turn around.

902
01:13:05,383 --> 01:13:07,230
From around the bend
the truck came.

903
01:13:07,611 --> 01:13:09,460
Report said it was
doing nearly 50.

904
01:13:12,754 --> 01:13:14,111
Hit Josh here.

905
01:13:16,544 --> 01:13:22,167
And he hesitated, like he
knew that he'd hit something

906
01:13:23,596 --> 01:13:25,257
but then just
drove off.

907
01:13:29,293 --> 01:13:31,609
What kind of person
could do something like that?

908
01:13:32,296 --> 01:13:39,063
I'm mean, what, was he drunk, was
he on drugs, was he a felon? What...

909
01:13:41,867 --> 01:13:46,015
How could he...
just drive off?

910
01:13:54,699 --> 01:13:55,903
There's no way
of knowing.

911
01:13:57,178 --> 01:14:00,203
When we get him,
we'll know.

912
01:14:10,817 --> 01:14:13,240
The police have given up
on this case, haven't they?

913
01:14:14,952 --> 01:14:16,432
No, not completely.

914
01:14:16,972 --> 01:14:19,081
The police are working
on a few things

915
01:14:19,522 --> 01:14:23,348
and I'm hopeful that they'll
have a break in the case.

916
01:14:25,449 --> 01:14:26,536
Like what?

917
01:14:28,852 --> 01:14:34,038
Mr. Learner, I believe that I'm gonna
have something concrete for you soon.

918
01:14:37,191 --> 01:14:38,625
I'm tired of
waiting.

919
01:14:40,414 --> 01:14:43,433
He's out there,
just laughing at me.

920
01:14:44,099 --> 01:14:45,349
Now understand this.

921
01:14:46,050 --> 01:14:47,774
I want this guy
to feel hunted.

922
01:14:47,833 --> 01:14:51,754
I want him to know that no matter how
long it takes, we're gonna get him.

923
01:14:53,607 --> 01:14:58,943
Your son, Lucas,
if somebody killed him,

924
01:15:00,563 --> 01:15:02,705
what would you want
to happen to them?

925
01:15:07,672 --> 01:15:09,325
I'd want to see
him go to prison.

926
01:15:10,353 --> 01:15:11,498
That's it?

927
01:15:12,898 --> 01:15:15,280
Knowing that he'll only
get a slap on the wrist?

928
01:15:18,491 --> 01:15:23,640
Mr. Learner, this is not a conversation that I
think you should be having with your attorney.

929
01:15:27,975 --> 01:15:29,200
Maybe you're right.

930
01:15:33,130 --> 01:15:34,625
Thanks for meeting
me out here.

931
01:15:54,471 --> 01:15:58,149
Hey, Dwight.
I need to talk to Ruth.

932
01:15:58,212 --> 01:15:59,993
Can you get her
for me, please?

933
01:16:00,200 --> 01:16:02,007
We're having a little shindig,
you know? A few friends.

934
01:16:02,231 --> 01:16:05,000
Yeah, listen, it's important.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.

935
01:16:05,936 --> 01:16:07,759
Sort of busy right now,
Dwight.

936
01:16:07,895 --> 01:16:10,754
Norris, I want to talk
to the mother of my kid, okay?

937
01:16:11,447 --> 01:16:13,274
All right, look,
take it easy. Just...

938
01:16:13,957 --> 01:16:15,708
- Honey, is everything...
- Hey, Ruth.

939
01:16:15,962 --> 01:16:17,925
- Dwight, what are you doing here?
- Can I have a word with you, please?

940
01:16:18,572 --> 01:16:20,671
- It's not a good time. We've got people over.
- Yeah, a shindig.

941
01:16:21,324 --> 01:16:23,041
You can come back Saturday
if you want to talk.

942
01:16:23,238 --> 01:16:26,428
I need a big favor from you. Can I just
have a word with you for a minute, alone?

943
01:16:29,052 --> 01:16:29,902
Okay.

944
01:16:30,693 --> 01:16:33,736
- Norris, do you mind going to our guests? I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

945
01:16:35,328 --> 01:16:37,369
What is it, Dwight?

946
01:16:37,445 --> 01:16:41,868
Tomorrow's the first day of the World
Series. I want to take Luke for the week.

947
01:16:42,763 --> 01:16:44,577
No. That's not
what the court ordered.

948
01:16:44,647 --> 01:16:47,916
Okay, can we just forget about
the whole court thing for a minute?

949
01:16:47,986 --> 01:16:50,330
Norris doesn't care about
the series. It's the Sox.

950
01:16:50,400 --> 01:16:51,685
When is that
ever gonna happen again?

951
01:16:51,755 --> 01:16:53,298
I just want to
take him for the week.

952
01:16:53,375 --> 01:16:57,004
I'll get him to school
on time. Please. After that...

953
01:16:59,325 --> 01:17:02,390
After that, I have to go
away for a little while.

954
01:17:02,465 --> 01:17:04,414
Jesus, Dwight,
you're always running away.

955
01:17:04,482 --> 01:17:07,513
Listen, you're always telling me that
I gotta take responsibility for myself.

956
01:17:07,589 --> 01:17:10,226
Well, that's what
I'm trying to do here, okay?

957
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:12,669
Let me have him.

958
01:17:13,605 --> 01:17:16,570
Will you tell me what's going
on with you? What's wrong?

959
01:17:16,647 --> 01:17:20,975
I just wanna spend a week with my
son, okay? He's all that I got left.

960
01:17:23,424 --> 01:17:26,365
Jesus, Dwight. All right, you
can have him, you can have him.

961
01:17:27,724 --> 01:17:28,464
Thank you.

962
01:17:30,081 --> 01:17:31,053
You know,
I'm sorry.

963
01:17:37,113 --> 01:17:38,937
- I got to go.
- Good night.

964
01:17:57,753 --> 01:17:58,833
This is for you.

965
01:17:58,908 --> 01:18:00,618
- Hey.
- Hi. How are you?

966
01:18:00,690 --> 01:18:03,818
Well, she played so beautifully at the
concert, we just wanted to thank you.

967
01:18:05,442 --> 01:18:08,571
Oh, hey, check it out. They
have a Halloween fright night.

968
01:18:08,643 --> 01:18:11,050
You wanna go
next week?

969
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:13,155
Let's talk about
that later, okay?

970
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:15,401
I'll race you to
the hot dogs. Go!

971
01:18:17,158 --> 01:18:19,655
Look at all this
chocolate.

972
01:18:19,731 --> 01:18:20,744
Mr. Learner?

973
01:18:20,820 --> 01:18:23,689
No. None for me, thanks.
Please call me Ethan.

974
01:18:23,758 --> 01:18:25,602
I have some coffee
if you'd like it.

975
01:18:25,671 --> 01:18:27,584
Sure. That
would be great.

976
01:18:27,652 --> 01:18:31,274
I really hope that Emma is
going to stay in her classes

977
01:18:31,348 --> 01:18:34,081
now that she's
finished the concert.

978
01:18:34,154 --> 01:18:35,470
I'd like that.

979
01:18:35,539 --> 01:18:37,677
You're so
talented, honey.

980
01:18:39,499 --> 01:18:40,917
Your son's quite
the Red Sox fan.

981
01:18:40,984 --> 01:18:43,155
He must be excited
about the series coming up.

982
01:18:43,228 --> 01:18:45,692
Yeah. He and Dwight
are fanatics.

983
01:18:46,726 --> 01:18:48,639
He's over there
right now.

984
01:18:48,706 --> 01:18:51,047
They're gonna watch
the game tonight together.

985
01:18:51,116 --> 01:18:52,690
Oh, Dwight lives
nearby?

986
01:18:52,765 --> 01:18:53,946
Yeah.

987
01:18:55,736 --> 01:18:58,143
He's just over there
on Cove Road.

988
01:18:58,211 --> 01:19:01,340
He moved there so that
he could be close to Lou.

989
01:19:01,875 --> 01:19:03,292
Thank you.

990
01:19:05,835 --> 01:19:08,928
These hotdogs are definitely
worse than before.

991
01:19:11,445 --> 01:19:13,256
Worse, but better.

992
01:19:16,350 --> 01:19:18,913
The Red Sox are gonna win
tonight, right, Dad?

993
01:19:18,988 --> 01:19:20,000
You know it.

994
01:19:20,076 --> 01:19:22,447
So, how long were you
and Dwight together?

995
01:19:22,515 --> 01:19:24,021
Eight years.

996
01:19:25,679 --> 01:19:27,477
Yeah, we had a nickname
for each other.

997
01:19:27,971 --> 01:19:29,241
Nitro and Glycerin.

998
01:19:29,933 --> 01:19:33,417
You could say we had a kind
of explosive relationship.

999
01:19:34,284 --> 01:19:36,385
So he had a bit
of a temper?

1000
01:19:38,932 --> 01:19:40,674
Yeah.
We both did.

1001
01:19:41,569 --> 01:19:42,614
More coffee?

1002
01:19:42,689 --> 01:19:45,679
No, that's all right.
We actually have to get going.

1003
01:19:45,756 --> 01:19:47,858
Can I just use
your restroom first?

1004
01:20:52,543 --> 01:20:54,578
So, anyway, each one
could be a different animal.

1005
01:20:54,654 --> 01:20:57,846
Right, like if you could have a horse,
and then he could be, like, trotting...

1006
01:20:58,676 --> 01:21:00,214
Ready?

1007
01:21:00,290 --> 01:21:01,401
Yeah.

1008
01:21:02,562 --> 01:21:03,808
Listen.

1009
01:21:04,341 --> 01:21:07,271
When the series is over,
I got to go away for a while.

1010
01:21:07,338 --> 01:21:09,774
Why?
There's just something that I got to do

1011
01:21:09,840 --> 01:21:15,141
and I'm not going to be able
to see you for some time, Luke.

1012
01:21:15,209 --> 01:21:17,308
So how long do you have
to go away for?

1013
01:21:17,382 --> 01:21:19,415
I don't know.
Let's wait and see.

1014
01:21:19,491 --> 01:21:21,983
Hey, we don't do
so bad, you and me.

1015
01:21:22,093 --> 01:21:23,698
We're all right.

1016
01:21:58,386 --> 01:22:03,619
Yes, hello, I saw
your ad on the Net.

1017
01:22:04,874 --> 01:22:10,274
Yes, I'm looking for
a pistol. Something simple.

1018
01:22:12,234 --> 01:22:12,999
A revolver.

1019
01:22:21,495 --> 01:22:24,086
Hey, Dad! Sleep tight,
don't let the snakes bite!

1020
01:22:24,160 --> 01:22:26,885
Oh, that's funny.
That's funny.

1021
01:22:27,778 --> 01:22:29,616
I'll get you for that.

1022
01:22:39,521 --> 01:22:40,698
Shit.

1023
01:23:13,795 --> 01:23:15,858
Yeah! That's it!
That's it!

1024
01:23:15,985 --> 01:23:16,983
Yeah, you think
we could sweep?

1025
01:23:17,337 --> 01:23:20,105
I don't know. I think if they
could do it, this might be the year.

1026
01:23:21,235 --> 01:23:22,642
All right, it's
bedtime. Go on.

1027
01:23:23,094 --> 01:23:24,369
- All right. Night, Dad.
- Good night.

1028
01:23:25,755 --> 01:23:27,598
Get washed up. I'll see
you in there in a minute.

1029
01:23:27,867 --> 01:23:30,493
<i>...in the middle of this diamond at
Busch Stadium after a 4 to 1 victory</i>

1030
01:23:31,203 --> 01:23:32,876
<i>to go up three games to none.</i>

1031
01:24:46,871 --> 01:24:48,370
Mr. Learner?

1032
01:24:53,617 --> 01:24:54,818
Okay.

1033
01:24:59,356 --> 01:25:00,351
Dad?

1034
01:25:00,430 --> 01:25:02,673
That's my son.
That's my son.

1035
01:25:03,484 --> 01:25:05,060
Dad, what was
that noise?

1036
01:25:05,666 --> 01:25:08,046
- Lou, it's just a stool.
- Shut him up!

1037
01:25:08,116 --> 01:25:10,622
It's a stool.
A stool fell down, honey.

1038
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:14,316
Look, please, let me just
talk to him, he's just a kid.

1039
01:25:15,332 --> 01:25:16,969
Okay, we're going.
Go.

1040
01:25:17,044 --> 01:25:18,645
Okay.

1041
01:25:19,091 --> 01:25:20,258
Okay.

1042
01:25:24,295 --> 01:25:25,195
Lou.

1043
01:25:25,858 --> 01:25:27,171
Dad, what was
that noise?

1044
01:25:27,686 --> 01:25:28,688
It was just the TV, okay?

1045
01:25:28,840 --> 01:25:30,822
I dropped a stool.
Go to bed, all right?

1046
01:25:31,042 --> 01:25:32,343
I have to pee
anyway.

1047
01:25:32,417 --> 01:25:34,792
Oh, Jesus, Lou.
Just go to sleep, all right?

1048
01:25:34,868 --> 01:25:37,408
Dad, I really
have to pee.

1049
01:25:39,734 --> 01:25:41,910
All right, come on,
hurry, quick.

1050
01:25:41,981 --> 01:25:43,686
Come on,
come on.

1051
01:25:45,777 --> 01:25:48,725
Come on, hurry up, Lou.
Come on.

1052
01:25:59,168 --> 01:26:02,928
Lou, come on, honey,
you got to get back to bed.

1053
01:26:03,396 --> 01:26:04,895
I'm coming.

1054
01:26:11,684 --> 01:26:12,919
Okay.

1055
01:26:13,429 --> 01:26:15,603
Get into bed.
Get in.

1056
01:26:16,785 --> 01:26:18,464
Good night.
Good night, Dad.

1057
01:26:18,533 --> 01:26:20,413
Get to bed.
You have a big day tomorrow.

1058
01:26:20,885 --> 01:26:22,286
I love you, Lou.

1059
01:26:22,592 --> 01:26:23,591
Love you, too.

1060
01:26:34,316 --> 01:26:35,759
Get back.

1061
01:26:37,104 --> 01:26:40,392
Outside. Just take me
out of the house.

1062
01:26:40,465 --> 01:26:42,504
Take me out
of the house.

1063
01:26:45,236 --> 01:26:46,713
Look away.
Okay.

1064
01:26:46,782 --> 01:26:50,069
Put your arms together.
Go. Look away. Turn away.

1065
01:26:50,141 --> 01:26:52,489
Okay, go.
That car.

1066
01:26:54,682 --> 01:26:57,126
Don't look.
Just go.

1067
01:26:58,310 --> 01:27:01,024
Listen to me.
Don't do this.

1068
01:27:02,103 --> 01:27:03,374
Stay there.
Don't look at me.

1069
01:27:03,447 --> 01:27:05,692
- Don't do this.
- Turn around.

1070
01:27:06,505 --> 01:27:07,742
Take me to the police.

1071
01:27:07,815 --> 01:27:08,983
Take you to the police?

1072
01:27:09,059 --> 01:27:11,912
So you can weasel your way out
with your fucking influence?

1073
01:27:11,982 --> 01:27:13,482
I swear to God,
you get in the...

1074
01:27:13,561 --> 01:27:14,901
Take me to the police,
Ethan.

1075
01:27:14,972 --> 01:27:16,610
Why? So you can fucking
deceive and manipulate?

1076
01:28:28,519 --> 01:28:30,265
Get out.
Turn me in.

1077
01:28:30,339 --> 01:28:31,947
Just turn
me in!

1078
01:28:32,798 --> 01:28:34,038
Get out.

1079
01:28:38,767 --> 01:28:42,261
Oh, God, don't shoot me.
Please don't shoot me.

1080
01:28:44,191 --> 01:28:48,125
Get out.
Out!

1081
01:28:48,973 --> 01:28:50,892
Get out!
Out!

1082
01:28:50,962 --> 01:28:51,960
Please don't shoot.

1083
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:55,165
You fucking animal! Get out
or I'll kill you right here!

1084
01:28:55,242 --> 01:28:56,655
Get out!

1085
01:28:58,038 --> 01:28:59,774
Come on, it was
an accident.

1086
01:28:59,809 --> 01:29:02,739
Shut up. Shut up!
Go.

1087
01:29:09,051 --> 01:29:10,575
- It was an accident.
- It wasn't an accident!

1088
01:29:10,995 --> 01:29:12,462
You don't drive away
from an accident!

1089
01:29:12,911 --> 01:29:14,497
- You just left!
- I was scared!

1090
01:29:20,197 --> 01:29:21,526
I'm telling you,
don't do this.

1091
01:29:22,548 --> 01:29:24,822
Don't ruin your life
the way I've ruined mine.

1092
01:29:26,360 --> 01:29:27,321
Turn around.

1093
01:29:33,813 --> 01:29:35,866
You robbed me
of my life.

1094
01:29:36,558 --> 01:29:41,870
You left my boy on the side
of the road and you drove off!

1095
01:29:44,149 --> 01:29:46,446
You have ruined
my family!

1096
01:29:49,004 --> 01:29:53,763
And you look at me in the face and
you deceived me and you lied to me!

1097
01:29:55,513 --> 01:29:56,914
You deserve to die.

1098
01:29:57,284 --> 01:29:58,560
You killed my son!

1099
01:29:58,735 --> 01:29:59,871
You killed my son!

1100
01:30:04,708 --> 01:30:06,248
Stop it!
Stop it!

1101
01:30:18,363 --> 01:30:21,625
It's over.
It's over.

1102
01:30:31,372 --> 01:30:35,918
Get up. Get up.
Get up!

1103
01:30:56,726 --> 01:30:58,496
You want me
to kill myself?

1104
01:30:59,756 --> 01:31:01,924
Tell me to do it!
Tell me!

1105
01:31:02,000 --> 01:31:05,698
Not a fucking day goes by where
I don't see your son's body

1106
01:31:05,775 --> 01:31:09,206
hitting my car
and going off into the dark!

1107
01:31:11,113 --> 01:31:13,118
I wish it
were me.

1108
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:17,529
Tell me to do it.
Please, tell me to do it.

1109
01:31:22,946 --> 01:31:25,555
Please, tell me
to do it.

1110
01:31:30,296 --> 01:31:31,918
Please.

1111
01:31:33,623 --> 01:31:37,286
I'm dead anyway.
I'm dead.

1112
01:31:50,874 --> 01:31:54,065
Oh, God, please don't
leave me here!

1113
01:31:56,834 --> 01:32:01,143
Please forgive me.
Please forgive me.

1114
01:32:02,759 --> 01:32:04,195
I'm sorry.

1115
01:32:06,664 --> 01:32:08,170
I can't.

1116
01:32:09,301 --> 01:32:11,321
I can't.
Please.

1117
01:33:11,090 --> 01:33:14,301
I miss him
so much.

1118
01:33:15,646 --> 01:33:16,872
I know.

1119
01:33:18,455 --> 01:33:23,383
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1120
01:33:29,176 --> 01:33:30,846
Let's go
inside.

1121
01:33:37,107 --> 01:33:39,397
I left that night
because...

1122
01:33:41,634 --> 01:33:45,153
I was really afraid that
I was going to lose you.

1123
01:33:48,762 --> 01:33:50,723
That's no excuse.

1124
01:33:51,688 --> 01:33:54,362
What I did
was wrong.

1125
01:33:54,713 --> 01:33:56,157
I'm going to be
going to prison

1126
01:33:57,147 --> 01:33:59,113
and I deserve
to go to prison.

1127
01:34:01,323 --> 01:34:02,646
I just want you to
remember that...

1128
01:34:02,885 --> 01:34:07,419
these last days that we had together
and how wonderful they were, and...

1129
01:34:09,728 --> 01:34:13,036
I feel like I've been able to be the
father to you that you really deserve.

1130
01:34:15,174 --> 01:34:17,647
I guess what I'm
just trying to say is...

1131
01:34:19,079 --> 01:34:20,352
that I'm sorry.
