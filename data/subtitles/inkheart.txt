Resync: Xenzai[NEF]

2
00:00:18,265 --> 00:00:19,584
<i>Since the dawn of time...</i>

3
00:00:19,745 --> 00:00:23,943
<i>...storytellers have enchanted
audiences with their words.</i>

4
00:00:24,105 --> 00:00:27,017
<i>But there is an even rarer gift:</i>

5
00:00:27,185 --> 00:00:30,382
<i>There are those,
who by reading out loud...</i>

6
00:00:30,545 --> 00:00:33,821
<i>...can bring characters to life.</i>

7
00:00:33,985 --> 00:00:37,534
<i>Out of books and into our world.</i>

8
00:00:37,705 --> 00:00:40,902
Go to sleep now. Shh.
Go to sleep, baby girl.

9
00:00:41,065 --> 00:00:44,137
- Maybe this will work. Let me read to her.
She's too young.

10
00:00:44,305 --> 00:00:46,136
- No.
- Shh.

11
00:00:46,305 --> 00:00:47,897
Why don't you read to me?

12
00:00:52,065 --> 00:00:54,579
"Once upon a time,
there was a dear little girl...

13
00:00:55,105 --> 00:00:57,335
...who was loved
by everyone who met her...

14
00:00:57,505 --> 00:01:01,465
...but especially by her grandmother,
who would've given her anything.

15
00:01:02,226 --> 00:01:08,142
Once she gave her
a little hood of red velvet. "

16
00:01:09,066 --> 00:01:10,055
What was that?

17
00:01:12,866 --> 00:01:14,379
What?

18
00:01:15,906 --> 00:01:18,022
I don't know. Nothing.

19
00:01:22,186 --> 00:01:25,496
"Red velvet that suited her so well...

20
00:01:25,666 --> 00:01:28,385
...that she refused to wear
anything instead of it.

21
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:32,505
So she was called
Little Red Riding Hood. "

22
00:01:34,146 --> 00:01:36,979
<i>Most of these Silvertongues,
as they are known...</i>

23
00:01:37,146 --> 00:01:39,102
<i>...prefer to keep their skills a secret.</i>

24
00:01:39,266 --> 00:01:42,497
<i>But some do not even know
that this gift is theirs...</i>

25
00:01:43,426 --> 00:01:45,223
<i>...until it is too late.</i>

26
00:01:59,946 --> 00:02:02,824
Is this the right way?
Next turn on the left.

27
00:02:02,986 --> 00:02:05,056
Are you sure?
Because I think we missed it.

28
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:06,944
Who's the driver? Dad.

29
00:02:07,106 --> 00:02:09,336
Who's the navigator? Me.

30
00:02:09,506 --> 00:02:11,781
- Have I ever got us lost before?
- No.

31
00:02:11,946 --> 00:02:13,265
No.

32
00:02:13,426 --> 00:02:15,462
Oh, hey. Look, a Sasquatch.

33
00:02:15,866 --> 00:02:18,505
Hey! Oh, the turning, left, left, left!

34
00:02:34,147 --> 00:02:38,186
The Alpine Antiquarian Bookshop
should be at the end of this street...

35
00:02:38,347 --> 00:02:40,417
...and on the right-hand
side of the square.

36
00:02:40,587 --> 00:02:42,066
Good.

37
00:02:42,227 --> 00:02:45,344
By the way, how come every bookshop
we go to is a thousand years old?

38
00:02:45,507 --> 00:02:46,542
Why can't we go to one...

39
00:02:46,707 --> 00:02:49,175
...that sells hot chocolate
and books that are actually new?

40
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:52,100
What good would a bookbinder
like me be in a new bookstore?

41
00:02:52,267 --> 00:02:56,977
- I love old books. The marbled pages...
- End papers, the leather binding...

42
00:02:57,747 --> 00:02:59,783
This is my kind of place.

43
00:03:01,227 --> 00:03:04,264
- Maybe you'll find it here, Mo.
- Find what?

44
00:03:04,427 --> 00:03:06,577
That book you're always looking for.

45
00:03:07,307 --> 00:03:10,504
- I'm not looking for anything particular.
You don't think I've noticed?

46
00:03:10,667 --> 00:03:13,579
You never leave a bookshop unless
you've checked every corner.

47
00:03:13,747 --> 00:03:17,581
- Don't we?
- No, you always come away disappointed.

48
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:21,105
Sometimes your eyes
are even a little red.

49
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:23,383
It's because old books are dusty.

50
00:03:24,587 --> 00:03:26,782
<i>Hey, look, Harriet the Spy.</i>

51
00:03:26,947 --> 00:03:28,744
I'm going inside. You want to come?

52
00:03:28,907 --> 00:03:31,740
<i>- The Secret Garden!
- Or I guess you could stay here.</i>

53
00:03:53,508 --> 00:03:56,181
Afternoon. I'm Mortimer Folchart.

54
00:03:56,948 --> 00:03:58,904
Ah! The famous book doctor.

55
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,337
Well, you're just in time.

56
00:04:02,788 --> 00:04:03,777
Look at this poor patient.

57
00:04:03,948 --> 00:04:06,178
- Uh-oh.
- Do you think we can save him?

58
00:04:06,348 --> 00:04:08,225
- I think the prognosis is good.
- Excellent.

59
00:04:09,868 --> 00:04:12,223
- Quite the collection you have.
- Yes.

60
00:04:12,388 --> 00:04:15,505
- If you'd like to look around, be my guest.
- Thank you.

61
00:04:25,588 --> 00:04:27,943
<i>Fine, intelligent eye.</i>

62
00:04:28,108 --> 00:04:30,497
<i>What do you say to calling him
Black Beauty?</i>

63
00:04:33,828 --> 00:04:34,943
<i>Oh, my dear child.</i>

64
00:04:37,548 --> 00:04:38,663
<i>Imagine, Heidi.</i>

65
00:04:38,828 --> 00:04:41,706
<i>Capricorn's men were looking
for Dustfinger in the wrong place.</i>

66
00:04:41,868 --> 00:04:43,460
<i>Southwest end of Treasure Island.</i>

67
00:04:43,628 --> 00:04:45,858
<i>He hadn't left the village.</i>

68
00:04:46,788 --> 00:04:48,904
<i>He hadn't even tried.</i>

69
00:04:51,948 --> 00:04:54,906
<i>Dustfinger was in Basta's house.</i>

70
00:04:55,668 --> 00:04:59,422
<i>What is that? Coming over
the hill? It's a beast of some kind!</i>

71
00:05:25,309 --> 00:05:26,947
Dustfinger.

72
00:05:31,749 --> 00:05:34,024
He doesn't like to be tickled.

73
00:05:34,989 --> 00:05:36,581
And you should be more careful.

74
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:38,548
His name's Gwin.

75
00:05:38,709 --> 00:05:40,427
And I know he looks charming...

76
00:05:41,029 --> 00:05:44,101
...but you know what they say
about books and covers.

77
00:05:49,789 --> 00:05:51,939
Uh... Yeah, I do.

78
00:05:52,109 --> 00:05:54,907
I also know what they say about
talking to strangers. Excuse me.

79
00:05:55,069 --> 00:05:57,185
But I'm not a stranger, Meggie.

80
00:05:58,189 --> 00:06:01,625
You won't remember me, we only
met once, and you were quite small.

81
00:06:02,029 --> 00:06:04,065
But I'm no stranger.

82
00:06:07,629 --> 00:06:08,823
Hello, Silvertongue.

83
00:06:10,349 --> 00:06:13,068
I was just having a talk
with your daughter.

84
00:06:13,549 --> 00:06:15,858
Meggie, go wait for me in the van.

85
00:06:16,389 --> 00:06:17,708
It's all right, he's a friend.

86
00:06:17,869 --> 00:06:20,224
- Dad.
- Do it now!

87
00:06:24,549 --> 00:06:26,983
Let's you and me go for a little walk.

88
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,781
I've been looking for you.

89
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:41,180
I've been one step behind you for years.

90
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,902
Waiting for you to find what it is
you've been searching for.

91
00:06:45,070 --> 00:06:47,300
Just tell me what you want.

92
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:50,667
I want you to put right
the wrong you did nine years ago.

93
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:54,106
And I'm here to warn you,
Capricorn knows where you're staying.

94
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:57,785
His men are there now waiting for you
and your daughter to come home.

95
00:06:57,950 --> 00:07:00,418
- He wants you to read for him.
- Well, he's out of luck.

96
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:02,706
I don't read aloud anymore.

97
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,428
If he finds you, you really think
you'll have a choice?

98
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:19,064
I could help you stay hidden,
but I won't.

99
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:22,825
Not unless you promise to send
me home. I've been here too long.

100
00:07:23,430 --> 00:07:25,580
Send me home, Silvertongue.

101
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,704
- Read to me.
- I'm sorry, I can't help you.

102
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:31,505
It's too dangerous. It's uncontrollable.

103
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,786
If you won't help me,
I'll find someone who can.

104
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,144
Just give me the book.

105
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:37,386
What book? I don't have the book.

106
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,260
- You don't have the book?
- No.

107
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,945
I've searched everywhere.
I don't have it.

108
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,539
What's in the bag?

109
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,629
Did you finally find one?

110
00:07:49,790 --> 00:07:53,544
It's funny, isn't it? Strange, my turning
up here right at that very moment.

111
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:58,026
You know, there are times in life
when the stars just simply align.

112
00:07:58,191 --> 00:08:00,102
But this is not one of those times!

113
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:06,459
Dad!

114
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:17,270
- Meggie!
- What's happening?

115
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:20,070
I told you to stay in the van! Run!

116
00:08:23,431 --> 00:08:24,420
Get in, get in!

117
00:08:27,591 --> 00:08:28,580
Come on. Start!

118
00:08:33,591 --> 00:08:36,059
Stop! I'm trying to help you!

119
00:08:42,631 --> 00:08:45,304
- What are you doing? Leave it alone.
- I want to see the book!

120
00:08:45,471 --> 00:08:47,302
You're not to touch that book,
understand?

121
00:08:47,471 --> 00:08:49,541
I don't understand.
I don't understand at all.

122
00:08:49,871 --> 00:08:52,863
What is that book? Why did the
freaky man with the scars want it?

123
00:08:53,031 --> 00:08:55,625
- Why did he call you Silvertongue?
- I can't tell you.

124
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:58,783
- You have to tell me.
- No. I have to protect you.

125
00:08:58,951 --> 00:09:00,270
And your mother.

126
00:09:01,071 --> 00:09:04,188
My mother? What has this
got to do with my mother?

127
00:09:05,071 --> 00:09:06,902
Meggie, please just...

128
00:09:09,831 --> 00:09:10,946
I'm scared, Mo.

129
00:09:13,351 --> 00:09:15,819
Meggie, I'm going to take care of you.

130
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:18,186
I always have, and I always will.

131
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:21,510
At least tell me where we're going.

132
00:09:21,832 --> 00:09:22,981
We're going to Italy.

133
00:09:23,592 --> 00:09:27,631
You have a great aunt there. It's
very important that we get there. Okay?

134
00:09:27,792 --> 00:09:30,989
Please, Meggie. No more questions.

135
00:10:07,592 --> 00:10:10,060
So she's friendly,
this great aunt of mine?

136
00:10:10,232 --> 00:10:11,301
You'll like her.

137
00:10:13,072 --> 00:10:16,621
Would you please
stop ringing that damn bell!

138
00:10:17,072 --> 00:10:19,825
After a while.
She's kind of an acquired taste.

139
00:10:19,992 --> 00:10:21,141
Right.

140
00:10:21,592 --> 00:10:22,911
What?

141
00:10:23,592 --> 00:10:24,820
Elinor.

142
00:10:25,552 --> 00:10:27,782
Well, for the love of Thomas Hardy.

143
00:10:28,792 --> 00:10:32,068
I'm so glad you've finally made
your way back here, Mortimer.

144
00:10:32,232 --> 00:10:34,666
My poor books
are in a terrible state of disrepair.

145
00:10:34,832 --> 00:10:36,584
Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

146
00:10:36,752 --> 00:10:39,471
Don't play with your food, child.
You're not a toddler.

147
00:10:39,632 --> 00:10:41,543
Look at her, she's as thin
as a soap bubble.

148
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,861
Oh, she so reminds me
of her mother.

149
00:10:46,193 --> 00:10:49,151
Not just when she opens her mouth,
if she ever does. Speaking of...

150
00:10:49,313 --> 00:10:51,463
We haven't heard from her,
if that's what you mean.

151
00:10:51,633 --> 00:10:52,702
Oh, well, no matter.

152
00:10:52,873 --> 00:10:55,865
I grew up without a mother.
Didn't do me any damage whatsoever.

153
00:10:56,753 --> 00:11:00,712
No, my mother just suddenly dashed off
on safari one day and never came back.

154
00:11:02,673 --> 00:11:06,063
It's what the women in our family seem
to do, they just go off on adventures.

155
00:11:06,233 --> 00:11:08,303
Not me, I prefer to stay where I am.

156
00:11:08,473 --> 00:11:10,191
But your mother...

157
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:12,431
Well, she wanted the real thing.

158
00:11:13,073 --> 00:11:14,711
My mum wanted me.

159
00:11:14,873 --> 00:11:17,228
And then one day she was gone,
without explanation.

160
00:11:17,393 --> 00:11:20,749
- Is that what you call an adventure?
- No, that's what I call abandonment.

161
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:26,542
Well done, Elinor.

162
00:11:26,713 --> 00:11:28,624
Oh, well, you know it's the truth.

163
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:32,432
Mum did not abandon us.

164
00:11:32,593 --> 00:11:34,902
No. No, she didn't.

165
00:11:35,153 --> 00:11:37,348
Well, then what really happened to her?

166
00:11:39,313 --> 00:11:41,986
I'm not a child anymore.
I'm all grown up.

167
00:11:42,153 --> 00:11:43,142
Almost.

168
00:11:43,313 --> 00:11:46,225
Enough to know the most important
thing that's ever happened to me.

169
00:11:46,393 --> 00:11:48,907
Don't you think I've realized
why I'm not in regular school?

170
00:11:49,073 --> 00:11:51,826
And why we're always
traveling around from place to place?

171
00:11:54,033 --> 00:11:56,627
All these years
you've been looking for Mum.

172
00:11:56,793 --> 00:12:00,342
And that book, but I just don't
understand how those two things...

173
00:12:00,513 --> 00:12:01,946
Meggie.

174
00:12:03,033 --> 00:12:05,547
You have to tell me something.

175
00:12:11,034 --> 00:12:13,628
- I write about her sometimes.
- You do?

176
00:12:13,794 --> 00:12:15,227
Yeah. I make up stories about...

177
00:12:15,394 --> 00:12:18,989
You make up stories? Meggie, you know
I don't want you doing that.

178
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:22,506
But I have to.

179
00:12:23,194 --> 00:12:25,628
I feel like the words bring her
back to me.

180
00:12:26,794 --> 00:12:28,147
Yeah.

181
00:12:29,074 --> 00:12:30,712
The written word.

182
00:12:31,954 --> 00:12:33,228
It's a powerful thing.

183
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:35,553
You have to be careful with it.

184
00:12:38,154 --> 00:12:40,065
Do you think we'll ever see her again?

185
00:12:42,514 --> 00:12:44,266
I hope we do, Meggie.

186
00:12:46,954 --> 00:12:48,307
I hope we do.

187
00:13:41,475 --> 00:13:43,591
Step away from that case!
Three steps back!

188
00:13:44,035 --> 00:13:45,229
Um, um...

189
00:13:45,395 --> 00:13:47,386
What are you doing?
This place is not for children.

190
00:13:47,555 --> 00:13:49,386
I thought I made that clear.
Come on, out.

191
00:13:49,555 --> 00:13:52,115
I'm sorry, I was just looking
for a book to read.

192
00:13:52,435 --> 00:13:53,550
Is that a nose print?

193
00:13:54,195 --> 00:13:58,029
Do you have any idea
how valuable this manuscript is?

194
00:13:58,195 --> 00:13:59,753
Yes, I know.

195
00:13:59,915 --> 00:14:01,030
Oh, you know, do you?

196
00:14:01,555 --> 00:14:03,068
It's Persian, isn't it?

197
00:14:03,435 --> 00:14:05,073
I can tell from the illuminations...

198
00:14:05,235 --> 00:14:08,113
...the pinks and the blues
and the gold-patterned background.

199
00:14:08,435 --> 00:14:11,472
Maybe from the late 12th century or so?

200
00:14:12,275 --> 00:14:14,505
Goodness me, what a little know-it-all.

201
00:14:14,835 --> 00:14:15,824
It's beautiful.

202
00:14:17,195 --> 00:14:20,665
Yes, it is, isn't it?
But I just adore everything Persian.

203
00:14:20,835 --> 00:14:23,224
- You've been to Persia, then?
- Yes, a hundred times.

204
00:14:23,395 --> 00:14:27,946
Along with St. Petersburg, Paris, Middle
Earth, distant planets and Shangri-la.

205
00:14:28,115 --> 00:14:29,673
And I never had to leave this room.

206
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:34,431
Books are adventure. They contain
murder and mayhem and passion.

207
00:14:36,115 --> 00:14:37,833
They love anyone who opens them.

208
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:42,793
If I promise not to touch anything...

209
00:14:43,315 --> 00:14:46,034
...could I maybe just sit
and read in here for a while?

210
00:14:49,395 --> 00:14:52,034
That was the window seat
where she used to curl up and read.

211
00:14:52,435 --> 00:14:53,788
She?

212
00:14:57,556 --> 00:14:58,545
Your mother.

213
00:14:59,796 --> 00:15:02,185
Your father used to read to her here.

214
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,874
This was hers.

215
00:15:07,236 --> 00:15:10,114
If I find even a bookmark out of place,
I'll lock this room up...

216
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:13,712
...and you'll never see the inside
of it again, that I can promise you.

217
00:15:39,876 --> 00:15:42,674
<i>Then Dorian Gray half opened the door.</i>

218
00:15:44,116 --> 00:15:45,549
<i>As he did so...</i>

219
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:28,756
<i>Farewell...</i>

220
00:16:28,917 --> 00:16:29,986
<i>- Trapped inside...</i>

221
00:16:32,117 --> 00:16:33,152
<i>- Desire of revenge...</i>

222
00:16:44,117 --> 00:16:45,345
I tried to warn you.

223
00:16:47,077 --> 00:16:50,786
I gave you every opportunity
to help me, but you refused.

224
00:16:51,597 --> 00:16:54,509
All you had to do was read me back.
You could have kept the book.

225
00:16:55,117 --> 00:16:56,266
But you had to run.

226
00:16:56,597 --> 00:16:58,667
So I turned to Capricorn.

227
00:16:59,597 --> 00:17:01,872
- What?
- He's promised to help me.

228
00:17:02,037 --> 00:17:03,595
What have you done?

229
00:17:06,477 --> 00:17:07,830
Meggie!

230
00:17:18,517 --> 00:17:21,395
There are men outside!
They're trying to break into the house!

231
00:17:37,157 --> 00:17:38,636
Meggie!

232
00:17:43,638 --> 00:17:44,627
Mo, look out!

233
00:17:47,278 --> 00:17:48,870
Mortimer, my books!

234
00:17:50,718 --> 00:17:52,276
Hello, Silvertongue.

235
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:53,871
- Basta?
- Did you miss me?

236
00:17:54,278 --> 00:17:55,267
Stop!

237
00:17:56,358 --> 00:17:58,508
Oh, you illiterate cretins!
Hold him!

238
00:17:58,678 --> 00:18:00,669
These are masterpieces
you're destroying!

239
00:18:00,838 --> 00:18:04,114
Masterpieces, you ignorant halfwit!

240
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:09,230
Stop!
I swear, I'll kill every last one of you!

241
00:18:09,398 --> 00:18:11,468
You know I could!
It would take a few words!

242
00:18:11,638 --> 00:18:15,233
Oh, we won't have to worry about
your words if we cut out your tongue!

243
00:18:15,398 --> 00:18:18,276
You remember my calling card,
don't you?

244
00:18:18,438 --> 00:18:19,632
One, two, three!

245
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:21,675
If that doesn't work...

246
00:18:22,678 --> 00:18:25,146
...well, there's always your daughter.

247
00:18:28,438 --> 00:18:30,588
- Get off me!
- No one gets hurt.

248
00:18:30,758 --> 00:18:32,111
Yes, the fire! The fire.

249
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,997
Isn't that what we agreed?
Isn't that what we agreed?

250
00:18:35,158 --> 00:18:37,718
Yes, we agreed, we agreed, we agreed!

251
00:18:40,278 --> 00:18:43,076
Evil spirits, I repel thee.
Evil spirits, I repel thee!

252
00:18:43,238 --> 00:18:44,591
Dad! Dad!

253
00:18:44,758 --> 00:18:46,669
Right, get them in the van.

254
00:18:46,838 --> 00:18:49,352
- You're not taking them too.
- Capricorn's orders.

255
00:18:49,518 --> 00:18:52,351
After all, we are going
to require a little leverage...

256
00:18:53,678 --> 00:18:54,747
...to make Daddy read.

257
00:18:55,798 --> 00:18:57,311
Meggie!

258
00:18:58,918 --> 00:19:03,434
Don't drag my daughter into this.
For God's sakes, she's just a child.

259
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:05,186
- No, don't! No!
- What's this?

260
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:06,997
- No.
- My only hope of finding my wife.

261
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:08,592
- My only hope of going home!
- No!

262
00:19:08,759 --> 00:19:10,989
What is it? When will you
tell me what is going on?

263
00:19:11,159 --> 00:19:14,356
Has your father ever read you
a bedtime story, Meggie?

264
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:16,908
- You might want to ask him why.
- Give me this.

265
00:19:18,479 --> 00:19:19,753
I'll take that!

266
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:26,988
No!

267
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:29,434
Oh, my books! No!

268
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:31,635
Come along, now. Hurry up.

269
00:19:33,559 --> 00:19:35,515
Oh, my books!

270
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:39,634
Come on!

271
00:20:04,199 --> 00:20:05,757
Meggie.

272
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:14,110
Where are we?

273
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:42,993
They're here.

274
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,475
Hey, they're coming!

275
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,514
Oh, how lovely.

276
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,268
After you.

277
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:15,071
Come on, out! Out!

278
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,039
Oh, they're rude!

279
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:22,632
Move! Move!

280
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,519
It's ticking.

281
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,876
Flying monkeys.

282
00:21:57,481 --> 00:21:59,073
- What is this place?
- I don't know.

283
00:21:59,241 --> 00:22:00,560
Welcome to our humble abode.

284
00:22:00,721 --> 00:22:02,439
- Enjoy your stay.
- Go on!

285
00:22:02,601 --> 00:22:06,037
No, I will not share this filthy hovel
with all those creatures!

286
00:22:06,201 --> 00:22:07,998
Go on, get in!

287
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:09,150
In you go!

288
00:22:13,081 --> 00:22:14,992
What are we doing here, Mortimer?

289
00:22:16,761 --> 00:22:19,116
Where did those monsters come from?

290
00:22:20,881 --> 00:22:21,870
Books.

291
00:22:24,761 --> 00:22:26,160
They came out of books.

292
00:22:26,321 --> 00:22:27,640
What are you talking about?

293
00:22:27,801 --> 00:22:32,431
Mortimer, be quick, be clear,
or I swear I'll disinherit you.

294
00:22:35,321 --> 00:22:38,518
Came out of books? What do you mean?

295
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:42,194
Come here.

296
00:22:47,921 --> 00:22:48,910
Meggie...

297
00:22:50,561 --> 00:22:53,075
...this is the story
you have been waiting to hear.

298
00:22:54,481 --> 00:22:58,269
Elinor, you were away at a book fair...

299
00:22:58,441 --> 00:23:03,151
...and we were housesitting for you.
Me, Meggie, your mum.

300
00:23:05,801 --> 00:23:08,076
<i>And that night we were in the library...</i>

301
00:23:09,401 --> 00:23:11,790
<i>...so I opened a copy
of a book we'd just bought.</i>

302
00:23:12,881 --> 00:23:13,870
<i>Inkheart.</i>

303
00:23:15,601 --> 00:23:16,830
<i>Inkheart.</i>

304
00:23:17,842 --> 00:23:20,436
<i>It was a good read.
Full of adventure and magic...</i>

305
00:23:21,722 --> 00:23:24,395
...and a creature called The Shadow.
Terrifying.

306
00:23:24,762 --> 00:23:26,992
<i>I read several chapters aloud
and nothing happened.</i>

307
00:23:30,002 --> 00:23:31,799
<i>Then they appeared, out of nowhere...</i>

308
00:23:32,402 --> 00:23:35,633
<i>...from the medieval world of the book.
At first it was Capricorn...</i>

309
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,074
<i>...a thuggish bandit
working for an evil duke.</i>

310
00:23:47,802 --> 00:23:51,715
<i>Then Basta, his knife-wielding sidekick.</i>

311
00:23:53,842 --> 00:23:55,912
<i>And then Dustfinger...</i>

312
00:23:57,202 --> 00:24:00,274
<i>...a traveling fire juggler
with magical powers.</i>

313
00:24:02,882 --> 00:24:04,110
My voice brought them out.

314
00:24:04,602 --> 00:24:06,957
Your voice brought them out
of the book?

315
00:24:07,122 --> 00:24:08,191
And her mother went in.

316
00:24:08,762 --> 00:24:10,195
That's how it works.

317
00:24:14,842 --> 00:24:17,675
<i>Dustfinger saved us
from Capricorn that night.</i>

318
00:24:18,202 --> 00:24:20,432
<i>It was only then that I realized...</i>

319
00:24:21,402 --> 00:24:23,757
<i>...Resa, your mum...</i>

320
00:24:23,922 --> 00:24:24,911
...she was gone.

321
00:24:26,522 --> 00:24:30,037
They'd come out of the book,
and she went into it.

322
00:24:34,362 --> 00:24:36,034
Resa!

323
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:39,754
And that, Meggie, was the last time
that I read to you.

324
00:24:40,763 --> 00:24:42,162
The night we lost your mother.

325
00:24:47,643 --> 00:24:50,111
Oh, she went into the book.

326
00:24:54,043 --> 00:24:56,273
Oh. Goodness sake, Mortimer!

327
00:24:56,443 --> 00:24:59,116
All these years you've allowed me
to think the worst of Resa!

328
00:24:59,283 --> 00:25:02,320
- Why didn't you tell us?
- Would you have believed me?

329
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:04,874
You want to read Mum
back out of the book.

330
00:25:06,523 --> 00:25:09,560
<i>That's why you've been searching
for Inkheart all these years.</i>

331
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:13,954
If she's alive, you mean.

332
00:25:14,123 --> 00:25:16,432
You say she's trapped in that book.
How do you know?

333
00:25:16,603 --> 00:25:18,514
Who's to say she got there? If she did...

334
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:22,835
...how could she survive for nine years
if the monsters are anything like those?

335
00:25:23,003 --> 00:25:24,277
Or worse.

336
00:25:24,603 --> 00:25:27,800
How do you know where she is?
Or if she's alive, even.

337
00:25:28,363 --> 00:25:30,160
How do you know?

338
00:25:35,163 --> 00:25:37,597
- It's like the illustration in the book.
- Kind of scary.

339
00:25:37,763 --> 00:25:39,879
It's hideous. The man's got
no taste whatsoever.

340
00:25:40,043 --> 00:25:41,522
Look, will you stop pushing me!

341
00:25:46,963 --> 00:25:51,081
Meggie, just pretend that you're in
a book. Children always escape in books.

342
00:25:51,243 --> 00:25:52,471
No, they don't.

343
00:25:52,643 --> 00:25:54,315
<i>Remember The Little Match Girl?</i>

344
00:25:54,483 --> 00:25:56,997
They found her in an alley
frozen to death.

345
00:25:59,163 --> 00:26:00,596
Walk.

346
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,116
Ah.

347
00:26:08,284 --> 00:26:09,876
Come in.

348
00:26:10,044 --> 00:26:12,512
We saved you the good seats.

349
00:26:12,684 --> 00:26:14,197
Capricorn.

350
00:26:14,844 --> 00:26:17,597
Uh! I told you to stop that!

351
00:26:17,764 --> 00:26:19,163
Please.

352
00:26:21,644 --> 00:26:23,236
You got old.

353
00:26:23,404 --> 00:26:24,439
You got a castle.

354
00:26:24,604 --> 00:26:26,515
- Indeed, I did.
- And a haircut.

355
00:26:26,684 --> 00:26:29,915
A lovely castle in a secluded part
of the country...

356
00:26:30,084 --> 00:26:32,154
...far from prying eyes.

357
00:26:33,484 --> 00:26:38,512
Oh, yes, I've adjusted rather well
to your world, don't you think?

358
00:26:40,444 --> 00:26:43,914
This must be your daughter.
So much life to live.

359
00:26:44,084 --> 00:26:46,598
You, however, are a noisy old bag.

360
00:26:46,764 --> 00:26:48,277
You make a racket
without opening your mouth.

361
00:26:48,444 --> 00:26:50,355
You barbaric piece of pulp fiction!

362
00:26:50,524 --> 00:26:52,913
Your malice is matched
by your stupidity!

363
00:26:53,084 --> 00:26:55,917
I don't know how things are
in that third-rate novel of yours...

364
00:26:56,084 --> 00:26:59,281
...but where I come from one
does not go around ravaging libraries!

365
00:26:59,444 --> 00:27:05,394
My life's work, destroyed
by a bunch of unread, solecistic thugs!

366
00:27:05,564 --> 00:27:09,079
I have no patience
for old women with big mouths.

367
00:27:11,364 --> 00:27:12,353
You know my reader.

368
00:27:12,804 --> 00:27:16,513
Darius, why don't we show our guests
what I have been up against?

369
00:27:16,684 --> 00:27:18,117
Read that.

370
00:27:18,684 --> 00:27:20,163
But you said...

371
00:27:20,324 --> 00:27:23,953
...I wouldn't have to read
once he got here.

372
00:27:24,124 --> 00:27:26,319
Yes, well, I lied, didn't I,
when I said that?

373
00:27:27,965 --> 00:27:29,478
Read the book.

374
00:27:30,605 --> 00:27:35,725
"Rapunzel had splendid long hair.

375
00:27:35,885 --> 00:27:39,878
It was as fine as spun gold.

376
00:27:40,045 --> 00:27:42,001
And when she heard... "

377
00:27:49,005 --> 00:27:51,075
Help! No!

378
00:27:52,525 --> 00:27:53,958
Help!

379
00:27:57,085 --> 00:27:58,359
You see?

380
00:27:58,525 --> 00:28:01,835
Look at the writing on her face. She's
only been half read out of the book.

381
00:28:02,845 --> 00:28:04,278
- Take her to the dungeon.
No!

382
00:28:04,445 --> 00:28:07,005
- And give her a haircut.
No!

383
00:28:07,205 --> 00:28:10,163
I'm not going to read out loud,
if that's what you're intending.

384
00:28:10,925 --> 00:28:13,359
- Not with them in the room.
- Bring the girl up, please.

385
00:28:14,965 --> 00:28:16,444
You take your...

386
00:28:26,525 --> 00:28:29,562
Here's how this will work: You'll
do exactly what I tell you to do...

387
00:28:29,725 --> 00:28:33,798
...or I'll kill the old lady and lock your
daughter up for eternity. Is that clear?

388
00:28:37,245 --> 00:28:39,475
Great. Well, let's get things started,
shall we?

389
00:28:42,285 --> 00:28:46,039
This is a great book, filled with riches.

390
00:28:51,246 --> 00:28:52,235
Reading out treasure?

391
00:28:52,406 --> 00:28:55,955
For now. Someone has to pay for repairs,
and all the locals have been bled dry.

392
00:28:56,926 --> 00:29:00,760
I'm warning you. I have no control
over what comes and goes.

393
00:29:02,246 --> 00:29:03,964
I have no idea what's going to happen.

394
00:29:04,126 --> 00:29:07,004
Well, this should be fun, then.
Let's give it a whirl.

395
00:29:18,206 --> 00:29:21,323
"Kasim gazed upon the treasures
within the cave.

396
00:29:21,966 --> 00:29:27,040
Mountains of gold and silver
were heaped from floor to ceiling.

397
00:29:27,206 --> 00:29:30,755
Piles of silks and sacks of jewels.

398
00:29:31,966 --> 00:29:34,764
Kasim gathered all the treasure
he could carry...

399
00:29:34,926 --> 00:29:38,885
...only to find
the door of the cave sealed shut.

400
00:29:40,006 --> 00:29:41,598
And by the will of Allah...

401
00:29:42,206 --> 00:29:43,844
...he'd forgotten the password.

402
00:29:44,326 --> 00:29:46,601
He cried out, 'Open Barley! '

403
00:29:47,246 --> 00:29:50,841
But the door did not budge. Kasim named
every grain of wheat he could think of.

404
00:29:51,326 --> 00:29:54,045
'Open Buckwheat! ' 'Open Millet! '

405
00:29:54,206 --> 00:29:56,766
But still the door would not open.

406
00:29:57,286 --> 00:29:59,800
Then came the sound
of approaching hooves. "

407
00:30:05,446 --> 00:30:06,435
Sand.

408
00:30:14,246 --> 00:30:18,923
"Kasim ran to hide, but tripped,
sending coins spilling in every direction.

409
00:30:19,087 --> 00:30:22,204
Then came the muffled call of
'Open Sesame! '

410
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:24,518
And the cave opened...

411
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:29,082
...to reveal
a most unpleasant collection...

412
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:31,805
...of bandits. "

413
00:30:32,647 --> 00:30:33,636
What?

414
00:31:12,767 --> 00:31:13,756
You see?

415
00:31:14,687 --> 00:31:16,279
Yes! Yes!

416
00:31:16,447 --> 00:31:17,721
That's how it's done!

417
00:31:21,167 --> 00:31:22,919
Look! What'd I tell you?

418
00:31:23,407 --> 00:31:27,480
Put that boy in the stable and feed him
to the ticking crocodile.

419
00:31:28,127 --> 00:31:30,038
But if he came out, who went in?

420
00:31:36,607 --> 00:31:37,756
Help.

421
00:31:39,008 --> 00:31:39,997
Help.

422
00:31:41,448 --> 00:31:42,642
It's my turn now.

423
00:31:45,288 --> 00:31:47,040
It's my turn now.

424
00:31:47,728 --> 00:31:48,763
Just like you promised.

425
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:50,477
Your turn?

426
00:31:53,128 --> 00:31:55,642
Oh, you mean this.

427
00:31:58,368 --> 00:32:01,724
It's an incredibly rare book, this. We've
been tracking them down for years.

428
00:32:01,888 --> 00:32:03,879
I can't send you back.
I don't know how.

429
00:32:04,528 --> 00:32:05,881
Send us back?

430
00:32:07,728 --> 00:32:10,367
Why would we ever want to go back...

431
00:32:10,528 --> 00:32:13,406
...when your world
is so accommodating?

432
00:32:13,568 --> 00:32:16,605
With your telephones
and your guns and...

433
00:32:16,928 --> 00:32:18,361
What's that sticky stuff called?

434
00:32:18,608 --> 00:32:21,680
- Duct tape.
- Yes, duct tape.

435
00:32:21,848 --> 00:32:24,203
I love duct tape.

436
00:32:25,128 --> 00:32:27,847
<i>Besides, what was I in Inkheart?</i>

437
00:32:28,808 --> 00:32:30,366
The Adderhead's henchman.

438
00:32:30,848 --> 00:32:34,284
Living in the woods
with all those filthy beasts.

439
00:32:34,848 --> 00:32:36,122
But look at me now.

440
00:32:37,488 --> 00:32:38,523
I've got a castle.

441
00:32:39,568 --> 00:32:42,446
I'll never go back. None of us ever will.

442
00:32:43,048 --> 00:32:45,642
To make sure of that, I'm going to
do what I always do...

443
00:32:45,808 --> 00:32:48,117
...when someone digs up a copy
of this tedious book.

444
00:32:48,288 --> 00:32:49,767
You promised I'd be sent home.

445
00:32:49,928 --> 00:32:51,805
Yes, I know. I lied when I said that.

446
00:32:51,968 --> 00:32:54,687
I mean, I'm a liar.
I lie all the time. Lie, lie, lie.

447
00:32:54,848 --> 00:32:57,567
After all these years,
you'd think he'd figure it out by now.

448
00:32:59,328 --> 00:33:00,681
- No!
- No!

449
00:33:01,569 --> 00:33:02,558
Get it! Get it out!

450
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:05,641
No!

451
00:33:08,329 --> 00:33:11,560
Must you do that every single time?
It's pathetic, honestly.

452
00:33:13,129 --> 00:33:14,448
Don't!

453
00:33:18,049 --> 00:33:19,402
Now, get your burns tended to.

454
00:33:19,569 --> 00:33:21,958
Otherwise, I'll be forced
to cancel our Juggle Night.

455
00:33:22,129 --> 00:33:25,360
You know how much I look forward
to Juggle Night. Lock them up.

456
00:33:36,049 --> 00:33:40,440
Hey, Darius. Don't forget to feed
the crocodile, will you?

457
00:33:43,849 --> 00:33:45,407
Oh, for the love of Theseus!

458
00:33:49,729 --> 00:33:52,084
No, no, no. He didn't mean it.

459
00:33:52,249 --> 00:33:55,924
He's just hungry.
It's not his fault.

460
00:33:56,089 --> 00:33:57,204
He's a Minotaur.

461
00:33:57,369 --> 00:34:01,123
He can barely walk,
thanks to Darius and his reading.

462
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:02,847
A lot is down to this jackass.

463
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:06,638
We came out with half the book
tattooed across our face. Look at my eye.

464
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:09,569
If you think
that's bad, look at the state of my nose.

465
00:34:09,729 --> 00:34:11,799
- It's disgusting.
- Ye... All right.

466
00:34:12,049 --> 00:34:15,246
So you can imagine how pleased we are
that you're here.

467
00:34:15,409 --> 00:34:19,561
Delighted. Because now we got someone
who can really read.

468
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,441
I hurt myself.

469
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:41,563
Again.

470
00:34:46,930 --> 00:34:48,522
I don't understand it.

471
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:52,040
<i>In Inkheart, my hands,
they never burned.</i>

472
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:53,639
But here...!

473
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:59,168
Fire has no sense of humor.

474
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,443
You're trying to escape again?

475
00:35:08,810 --> 00:35:09,799
Resa...

476
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:12,043
...give up.

477
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:14,841
We're not going anywhere.

478
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:22,208
For a moment...

479
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:26,040
<i>...I held Inkheart in my hands.</i>

480
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:30,727
But it's ashes now.

481
00:35:33,890 --> 00:35:36,006
And I shall never go home.

482
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,965
But you...

483
00:35:42,530 --> 00:35:44,361
...you still have hope.

484
00:35:52,611 --> 00:35:56,524
When Darius read you out of Inkworld,
he left your voice behind in that book.

485
00:35:57,091 --> 00:35:58,319
But if you could talk...

486
00:35:58,491 --> 00:36:00,288
...would you tell me your story?

487
00:36:01,251 --> 00:36:02,684
Would you?

488
00:36:05,971 --> 00:36:07,290
No.

489
00:36:08,611 --> 00:36:12,365
No, you wouldn't. It's because of how
I'm written, isn't it?

490
00:36:12,531 --> 00:36:15,807
You think me weak and deceitful.

491
00:36:18,931 --> 00:36:20,410
It's not all I am.

492
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:25,804
Not all of me.

493
00:36:38,811 --> 00:36:40,449
It's just a dream.

494
00:36:40,611 --> 00:36:42,647
It's just a dream. It's just a dream.

495
00:36:42,811 --> 00:36:44,244
Are you all right?

496
00:36:45,291 --> 00:36:47,851
- What's your name?
- My name is Farid.

497
00:36:48,011 --> 00:36:50,366
- Are you one of the 40 thieves?
- Stop talking to me.

498
00:36:50,531 --> 00:36:53,728
Don't you know it's bad luck
to speak in a dream? You stupid girl.

499
00:36:55,251 --> 00:36:58,687
You talk in a dream,
you never find your way back.

500
00:36:58,851 --> 00:37:00,204
"Stupid"?

501
00:37:00,611 --> 00:37:03,967
You're the one who thinks you're in
a dream. I was just trying to be nice.

502
00:37:04,131 --> 00:37:06,247
Go back to your muttering
and see if I care.

503
00:37:06,411 --> 00:37:09,084
It's just a dream. Just a dream.

504
00:37:14,092 --> 00:37:15,241
Come home.

505
00:37:16,292 --> 00:37:17,884
Please come home.

506
00:37:24,492 --> 00:37:26,050
Good morning.

507
00:37:27,692 --> 00:37:29,091
Thank you.

508
00:37:29,932 --> 00:37:31,763
How can I ever repay you?

509
00:37:34,532 --> 00:37:38,320
Resa, even if I could find you a key,
where would you go?

510
00:37:50,452 --> 00:37:51,805
This is your family?

511
00:37:57,252 --> 00:37:58,480
This is your husband?

512
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:01,601
Your daughter?

513
00:38:15,772 --> 00:38:17,649
You went in the book when I came out.

514
00:38:19,652 --> 00:38:21,005
You went in the book...

515
00:38:21,172 --> 00:38:22,969
...when I came out...

516
00:38:24,172 --> 00:38:26,367
...and then Darius read you out again.

517
00:38:26,532 --> 00:38:27,885
Gwin.

518
00:38:33,092 --> 00:38:36,608
I'm gonna get you out of these chains,
and then you're going home.

519
00:38:48,653 --> 00:38:50,609
I'll meet you at the stables.

520
00:39:35,133 --> 00:39:37,408
I've never been that in control before.

521
00:39:39,053 --> 00:39:41,089
I know I can get Resa out of the book.

522
00:39:41,613 --> 00:39:43,808
And maybe send Capricorn back in.

523
00:39:44,133 --> 00:39:45,691
We just have to find another copy.

524
00:39:45,853 --> 00:39:48,572
Well, it only took you nine years
to find the last one.

525
00:39:50,053 --> 00:39:51,566
I bet the author has a copy.

526
00:39:53,893 --> 00:39:55,804
If he's alive, I bet he'd have one.

527
00:39:55,973 --> 00:39:58,089
Someone must know where he lives.

528
00:39:58,253 --> 00:40:01,724
Great. Now we're going to
have to try to escape, aren't we?

529
00:40:02,054 --> 00:40:04,773
Either that, or get fed
to the ticking crocodile next door.

530
00:40:05,614 --> 00:40:07,491
Someone has to stop him.

531
00:40:12,654 --> 00:40:15,043
Before you say anything,
I'm here to save your necks.

532
00:40:15,214 --> 00:40:18,490
After putting them on the chopping block
in the first place?

533
00:40:19,374 --> 00:40:23,686
Listen, you want your wife back as much
as I want to go home to my family.

534
00:40:23,854 --> 00:40:27,290
<i>You think there's another copy of
Inkheart out there, let's find it together.</i>

535
00:40:27,454 --> 00:40:29,763
And how do you intend that we escape?

536
00:40:32,574 --> 00:40:34,007
Page 14.

537
00:40:35,694 --> 00:40:37,366
The mighty storm?

538
00:40:38,854 --> 00:40:40,924
Get in the castle!
Let's go!

539
00:40:41,334 --> 00:40:44,292
<i>"From the far north they heard
a low wail of the wind...</i>

540
00:40:44,454 --> 00:40:46,365
<i>...and Uncle Henry and Dorothy
could see...</i>

541
00:40:46,534 --> 00:40:49,412
<i>...where the long grass bowed
in waves before the coming storm.</i>

542
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,606
<i>'There's a cyclone coming, Em.
I'll go after the stock. "'</i>

543
00:40:53,774 --> 00:40:56,049
Good doggies.

544
00:40:58,294 --> 00:40:59,773
<i>"Suddenly, Uncle Henry stood up. "</i>

545
00:41:01,134 --> 00:41:02,852
Get out of the square!

546
00:41:03,174 --> 00:41:06,325
<i>"He ran toward the sheds where
the cows and the horses were kept.</i>

547
00:41:06,494 --> 00:41:08,485
<i>Aunt Em dropped her work
and came to the door.</i>

548
00:41:08,654 --> 00:41:10,963
<i>One glance told her
of the danger close at hand.</i>

549
00:41:11,134 --> 00:41:13,170
<i>'Quick, Dorothy! Run for the cellar!"'</i>

550
00:41:13,334 --> 00:41:14,687
There she is! Come on!

551
00:41:14,854 --> 00:41:16,207
<i>"A strange thing happened.</i>

552
00:41:16,894 --> 00:41:21,046
<i>The house whirled around two or three
times and rose slowly through the air.</i>

553
00:41:22,574 --> 00:41:25,885
<i>Dorothy felt as if
she were going up in a balloon. "</i>

554
00:41:28,295 --> 00:41:29,364
That should do it!

555
00:41:32,895 --> 00:41:34,214
Let's get out of here!

556
00:41:38,695 --> 00:41:40,128
Must've run off!

557
00:41:46,135 --> 00:41:47,124
Help me!

558
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:07,015
Come here! Let's go.

559
00:42:09,055 --> 00:42:11,125
Come on!
Straight on!

560
00:42:12,295 --> 00:42:14,206
- Come on!
Get them!

561
00:42:18,855 --> 00:42:20,447
Come on, get up!

562
00:42:34,775 --> 00:42:36,288
You were right.

563
00:42:36,735 --> 00:42:37,884
<i>Mo!</i>

564
00:42:38,415 --> 00:42:40,690
<i>Gwin!
- Meggie!</i>

565
00:42:42,095 --> 00:42:43,084
Meggie!

566
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:45,729
Look! Hold on! Hold on! Wait, hold on!

567
00:42:47,136 --> 00:42:48,251
Don't move!

568
00:42:58,096 --> 00:42:59,495
Watch out!

569
00:43:04,776 --> 00:43:05,970
<i>Dustfinger!</i>

570
00:43:07,496 --> 00:43:08,929
Where are we going?

571
00:43:13,896 --> 00:43:16,126
<i>Don't leave me!</i>

572
00:43:18,856 --> 00:43:20,494
The prisoners!

573
00:43:20,936 --> 00:43:23,530
They're escaping!

574
00:43:29,336 --> 00:43:30,530
Run!

575
00:43:30,696 --> 00:43:32,095
Hurry, get in!
Run, run!

576
00:43:32,256 --> 00:43:33,894
Get in, get in!

577
00:43:38,416 --> 00:43:40,327
Get the keys, hurry up!
Take all the keys!

578
00:43:40,496 --> 00:43:42,407
Which one?
The one with the nine!

579
00:43:43,016 --> 00:43:45,007
Wait, wait, wait, Gwin!

580
00:43:46,216 --> 00:43:47,808
Come on, Gwin.

581
00:43:47,976 --> 00:43:49,648
Come on! Okay, go, go!

582
00:44:00,856 --> 00:44:02,209
Hold on!

583
00:44:08,416 --> 00:44:09,736
Watch out!

584
00:44:24,777 --> 00:44:26,210
Still think you're dreaming?

585
00:44:26,377 --> 00:44:27,810
Well, what else could it be?

586
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,776
We're flying.

587
00:44:31,177 --> 00:44:34,214
Or is it the night flying past us?

588
00:44:38,057 --> 00:44:39,536
He lives in Alassio.

589
00:44:39,697 --> 00:44:40,971
Which way is that?

590
00:44:41,137 --> 00:44:42,889
South.
South?

591
00:44:43,057 --> 00:44:45,207
Can't you be more precise?

592
00:45:07,497 --> 00:45:08,612
Beats a camel, huh?

593
00:45:08,777 --> 00:45:09,812
Farid.

594
00:45:09,977 --> 00:45:11,490
Oh, hooligan.

595
00:45:11,657 --> 00:45:15,332
Farid, some clothes for you.
You'll freeze to death otherwise.

596
00:45:15,497 --> 00:45:16,771
Apparently this is the place.

597
00:45:16,937 --> 00:45:20,088
Man in the fishmonger's says he lives
in an apartment over the square.

598
00:45:20,257 --> 00:45:21,246
Good. Great.

599
00:45:22,017 --> 00:45:23,006
Oh, I'm not coming.

600
00:45:23,457 --> 00:45:26,369
What do you mean? You have to come,
otherwise he won't believe me.

601
00:45:26,537 --> 00:45:28,926
Oh, I don't know.
You can be pretty persuasive.

602
00:45:29,097 --> 00:45:30,815
Huh?
- You talked me out of a book.

603
00:45:31,177 --> 00:45:33,248
The book is right here within our grasp...

604
00:45:33,418 --> 00:45:34,851
You're afraid.

605
00:45:37,898 --> 00:45:39,650
<i>You've never read Inkheart, have you?</i>

606
00:45:40,138 --> 00:45:41,730
What's there to read?

607
00:45:42,378 --> 00:45:46,053
I've lived it. Except for the end,
and I've got no interest in that.

608
00:45:46,218 --> 00:45:47,207
Well, why not?

609
00:45:47,378 --> 00:45:49,653
Do you know the end
of your story, Meggie?

610
00:45:50,658 --> 00:45:52,774
No. And I suspect you wouldn't want to.

611
00:45:52,938 --> 00:45:56,726
It'd be like turning
to the last page of a mystery.

612
00:45:57,418 --> 00:46:00,888
- Where's the fun in that?
- Well, I think I know the end of my story.

613
00:46:01,858 --> 00:46:03,450
Hm?
- I'm going home.

614
00:46:03,778 --> 00:46:05,006
Why?

615
00:46:05,178 --> 00:46:07,328
I'm sorry. It's just all too real for me.

616
00:46:07,498 --> 00:46:11,286
I prefer a story that has the good sense
to stay on the page where it belongs.

617
00:46:11,458 --> 00:46:14,211
No, I have to get back to my
poor, desecrated books.

618
00:46:14,378 --> 00:46:16,175
I want to mend them, put them in order.

619
00:46:16,338 --> 00:46:19,216
- I'll do that. Let me...
- Here's some money for you.

620
00:46:19,378 --> 00:46:21,608
You see, I've already bought my ticket.

621
00:46:22,218 --> 00:46:23,537
Goodbye.

622
00:46:23,978 --> 00:46:25,377
Good luck.

623
00:46:33,378 --> 00:46:34,367
- Elinor...
- Let her go.

624
00:46:34,538 --> 00:46:35,607
Don't catch cold.

625
00:46:35,778 --> 00:46:37,257
Bye, then.

626
00:46:44,858 --> 00:46:46,689
Here it is. This must be it.

627
00:46:47,338 --> 00:46:48,691
That's it.

628
00:46:49,298 --> 00:46:51,129
What? Oh.

629
00:46:53,578 --> 00:46:55,648
- Signor Fenoglio?
- Yes?

630
00:46:56,458 --> 00:46:58,415
Sir, my name's Mortimer Folchart.

631
00:46:58,579 --> 00:46:59,694
- I'm Meggie.
- My daughter.

632
00:46:59,859 --> 00:47:01,895
- I want to be a writer too.
- You do?

633
00:47:02,059 --> 00:47:05,847
Yes. Give me something to write with.
Be quick, I've got a cake in the oven.

634
00:47:07,139 --> 00:47:08,811
You look like you've been taxidermied.

635
00:47:08,979 --> 00:47:11,732
- If you want an autograph, give me a pen.
- We don't want one.

636
00:47:11,899 --> 00:47:13,571
- You don't want an autograph?
- No.

637
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:16,253
Then why in the name
of Chaucer's beard are you ringing?

638
00:47:16,419 --> 00:47:17,977
Well...

639
00:47:18,379 --> 00:47:21,576
Dustfinger's in the piazza, we just
escaped from Capricorn's village...

640
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:24,048
...and you won't even believe
what Basta tried to do.

641
00:47:26,059 --> 00:47:27,333
What?

642
00:48:01,299 --> 00:48:02,288
Come home.

643
00:48:03,699 --> 00:48:05,769
Please, come home.

644
00:48:06,419 --> 00:48:07,898
A good story, I'll give you that.

645
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:10,857
Silvertongues is a wonderful concept.
Wish I thought of it.

646
00:48:11,019 --> 00:48:12,247
Too absurd to take seriously.

647
00:48:12,419 --> 00:48:16,253
I know my characters are so believable
that they seem to leap off the page.

648
00:48:16,419 --> 00:48:18,455
But it's simply not possible.

649
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,854
Exactly as I imagined him.

650
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,534
This must be
what it feels like to give birth.

651
00:48:47,020 --> 00:48:49,090
Wait, where you going?
He doesn't want to meet.

652
00:48:49,260 --> 00:48:51,979
Of course he does.
I'm practically his father.

653
00:48:52,140 --> 00:48:54,017
Well, what was that at the end?

654
00:48:55,140 --> 00:48:56,368
It's called Dragon's Breath.

655
00:48:57,260 --> 00:48:58,978
You can teach to me?

656
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:05,853
I'm sure that this must be very exciting
for you to meet your characters.

657
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:09,012
But the purpose that we came here
was to find a way...

658
00:49:09,180 --> 00:49:10,693
...to get him back in the book.

659
00:49:10,860 --> 00:49:13,010
Your father's given me
an idea for a character.

660
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:15,489
A master thief who steals things...

661
00:49:15,660 --> 00:49:19,016
...the way a blue jay swipes
shiny objects off window sills.

662
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:20,772
I am not trying to steal them.

663
00:49:20,940 --> 00:49:23,215
You snatched them.
You're trying to keep them from me.

664
00:49:23,380 --> 00:49:24,938
That, my friend, is thievery.

665
00:49:25,100 --> 00:49:26,852
I'm just trying to get my wife back.

666
00:49:27,780 --> 00:49:28,769
Dustfinger.

667
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:31,295
- So wonderful to meet you.
- Oh, no, no. No.

668
00:49:31,460 --> 00:49:34,054
The scars are perfect.
As hideous as I imagined.

669
00:49:34,220 --> 00:49:37,212
I told you, he's afraid.
But, oh, not me, I hope.

670
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,810
He's afraid of what happens
at the end of the book.

671
00:49:39,980 --> 00:49:41,572
What do you mean? Because he dies?

672
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:44,134
Oh, no.

673
00:49:45,461 --> 00:49:48,692
- Oh, I see. Right, I'm sorry.
- He dies in the end?

674
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:52,490
I had to make the story exciting, it's my
job. They can't all have happy endings.

675
00:49:52,661 --> 00:49:54,697
Life doesn't always, after all.

676
00:49:57,301 --> 00:49:58,336
How's it happen?

677
00:49:58,501 --> 00:50:02,210
You're killed by one of Capricorn's men
while trying to save Gwin.

678
00:50:02,701 --> 00:50:05,738
It's a very touching death scene.
I cried when I wrote it.

679
00:50:06,221 --> 00:50:08,576
You think I care what you wrote?

680
00:50:10,061 --> 00:50:13,258
You don't control my fate.
Otherwise I wouldn't be here.

681
00:50:13,421 --> 00:50:16,060
I'm not just some character
in your book...

682
00:50:16,221 --> 00:50:18,610
...and you...

683
00:50:18,781 --> 00:50:20,578
...you're not my god.

684
00:50:21,741 --> 00:50:24,858
Now, listen, old man...

685
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:27,137
...do you have a copy
of the book or don't you?

686
00:50:27,301 --> 00:50:30,213
Because I would like
to go home now, please.

687
00:50:32,541 --> 00:50:35,055
The problem is it's been
out of print for decades.

688
00:50:35,221 --> 00:50:38,054
Plus, the original print run
was quite small.

689
00:50:38,221 --> 00:50:40,177
Then there was the fire
in the warehouse...

690
00:50:40,341 --> 00:50:42,491
...and the publishers
went out of business.

691
00:50:42,661 --> 00:50:44,856
This is gonna take forever.

692
00:50:47,981 --> 00:50:51,337
Stop it. This is no time to act foolishly.

693
00:50:54,621 --> 00:50:57,374
- Stop it.
- You're as sour as goat's urine.

694
00:50:58,181 --> 00:51:01,412
Thanks. And I don't want to know
how you know that.

695
00:51:02,061 --> 00:51:06,532
Look around. This garden is paradise.

696
00:51:06,701 --> 00:51:09,375
No slave drivers. No sandstorms.

697
00:51:09,862 --> 00:51:12,774
- No fleas.
- No peace and quiet.

698
00:51:15,182 --> 00:51:17,252
No, it's not that one either.

699
00:51:17,422 --> 00:51:18,901
I did hold on to a few copies...

700
00:51:19,062 --> 00:51:22,213
...but I loaned them to a book exhibition
in Genoa a few years ago...

701
00:51:22,382 --> 00:51:23,974
...and they were stolen.

702
00:51:24,142 --> 00:51:27,020
I suppose Capricorn
was behind the theft.

703
00:51:27,182 --> 00:51:30,219
At the time I assumed
it was just bad luck.

704
00:51:31,502 --> 00:51:33,572
- Ah! Here we are.
- What is it?

705
00:51:33,742 --> 00:51:37,337
The original manuscript. Look at that!
Typewritten, can you imagine?

706
00:51:37,502 --> 00:51:39,140
Grabbies.

707
00:51:40,102 --> 00:51:43,492
After all these years,
I still remember the characters.

708
00:51:44,862 --> 00:51:49,413
<i>The water nymphs in the Wayless Wood.</i>

709
00:51:54,342 --> 00:51:57,061
<i>And in the castles of Umbra...</i>

710
00:51:58,262 --> 00:51:59,490
<i>...the Black Prince.</i>

711
00:52:02,022 --> 00:52:03,011
<i>The Motley Folk.</i>

712
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:08,138
<i>And of course you, Dustfinger.</i>

713
00:52:08,462 --> 00:52:09,690
<i>As well as the villains:</i>

714
00:52:10,582 --> 00:52:14,575
<i>The Adderhead,
Capricorn and the Fire Raisers.</i>

715
00:52:15,542 --> 00:52:18,818
And the worst of all, The Shadow.

716
00:52:27,462 --> 00:52:29,737
It's a wonderful book, I must say.

717
00:52:30,702 --> 00:52:32,614
I'd give anything to go into it myself.

718
00:52:32,783 --> 00:52:34,057
Well, get in line, old man.

719
00:52:34,223 --> 00:52:36,657
I've got page 209 to 447.
What do you got?

720
00:52:36,823 --> 00:52:37,812
I have the rest.

721
00:52:38,543 --> 00:52:39,692
All right. Need that.

722
00:52:39,983 --> 00:52:41,735
Now you can read me back, right?

723
00:52:41,903 --> 00:52:46,772
Well, I'll try to. But that's only after I've
read my wife out, and she's all right.

724
00:52:46,983 --> 00:52:48,780
It's the only way I'm gonna do it.

725
00:52:48,943 --> 00:52:51,582
- We might have a problem.
- What are you talking about?

726
00:52:52,183 --> 00:52:53,377
You can't read her out.

727
00:52:54,103 --> 00:52:55,092
Why?

728
00:52:56,023 --> 00:52:57,741
Because she's not in the book.

729
00:52:58,783 --> 00:53:00,774
What are you not telling me?
I've seen her.

730
00:53:00,943 --> 00:53:03,980
She's not actually in the book anymore.

731
00:53:04,143 --> 00:53:05,576
- She's...
Where?

732
00:53:05,743 --> 00:53:07,859
She's in Capricorn's village.
Darius read her out.

733
00:53:08,023 --> 00:53:09,058
She's alive?

734
00:53:09,223 --> 00:53:10,736
We were just there
and you didn't tell me!

735
00:53:10,903 --> 00:53:12,859
- We need the book.
- We didn't need the book!

736
00:53:13,023 --> 00:53:14,217
I needed the book!

737
00:53:14,383 --> 00:53:16,260
My mum was there
and you didn't tell us?

738
00:53:17,023 --> 00:53:19,014
Listen...
Yeah, don't look at me like that...

739
00:53:19,183 --> 00:53:22,300
...because if your Dad knew the truth,
he wouldn't have helped me...

740
00:53:22,463 --> 00:53:23,612
...and I need the book.

741
00:53:23,783 --> 00:53:27,742
- Selfish, repugnant, weak character!
- Blame him, he wrote me that way.

742
00:53:27,903 --> 00:53:30,212
- I disagree.
- You tell me how to find her!

743
00:53:30,383 --> 00:53:32,260
Not until you promise to read me back.

744
00:53:32,423 --> 00:53:36,382
- Tell me how to find my wife.
- I miss my family too.

745
00:53:43,983 --> 00:53:45,177
All right.

746
00:53:45,743 --> 00:53:46,858
Promise.

747
00:53:48,343 --> 00:53:49,332
I promise.

748
00:53:52,623 --> 00:53:54,660
I want to help save Mum too.

749
00:53:54,824 --> 00:53:56,894
- Take me with you.
- You know I can't do that.

750
00:53:57,064 --> 00:53:58,053
But I can help.

751
00:53:58,224 --> 00:54:02,775
You can help by staying here and
being safe. That's what you can do.

752
00:54:02,944 --> 00:54:04,616
You don't know what I can do.

753
00:54:08,704 --> 00:54:10,183
And neither do I.

754
00:54:10,704 --> 00:54:12,695
Meggie, will you please...?

755
00:54:18,264 --> 00:54:20,903
Okay, come on. You got to stay here.

756
00:54:29,784 --> 00:54:31,820
- Thanks very much. Take care of Meggie.
- Yes.

757
00:54:31,984 --> 00:54:34,657
- And Farid as well.
- What?

758
00:54:34,824 --> 00:54:37,258
- Take care of Farid as well.
- Of course.

759
00:54:37,424 --> 00:54:39,574
Why can't I come too? It's my car.

760
00:54:41,704 --> 00:54:43,456
Sweetheart.

761
00:54:46,704 --> 00:54:48,501
Just bring her back.

762
00:54:49,064 --> 00:54:50,497
I will.

763
00:54:56,624 --> 00:55:00,981
Reduced to babysitting. Marvelous.

764
00:55:12,944 --> 00:55:15,981
Hurry up, we'll miss the train.
How long will it take to get there?

765
00:55:16,144 --> 00:55:17,577
Not very long. Come on.

766
00:55:17,744 --> 00:55:19,656
Can I sit next to you, Mum?
Me too.

767
00:55:19,825 --> 00:55:21,417
I'll sit in the middle.

768
00:55:43,145 --> 00:55:45,579
<i>"That just
happened, " said Dorothy, simply.</i>

769
00:55:45,745 --> 00:55:47,815
<i>"I could not help it. "</i>

770
00:55:51,865 --> 00:55:54,095
<i>You have no right to...</i>

771
00:55:59,145 --> 00:56:02,217
<i>"If you wish me to use my magic powers
to send you home...</i>

772
00:56:02,665 --> 00:56:04,621
<i>...you must do something for me first.</i>

773
00:56:05,425 --> 00:56:08,223
<i>Help me and I will help you. "</i>

774
00:56:09,865 --> 00:56:11,935
<i>"What must I do?" said the girl.</i>

775
00:56:12,465 --> 00:56:15,218
<i>"Kill the Wicked Witch of the West. "</i>

776
00:56:28,305 --> 00:56:30,944
" From the far north they heard
a low wail of the wind...

777
00:56:31,105 --> 00:56:34,222
...and Uncle Henry and Dorothy
could see where the long grass bowed...

778
00:56:34,385 --> 00:56:35,784
...before the coming storm. "

779
00:56:45,706 --> 00:56:48,266
"It was Toto that made Dorothy laugh.

780
00:56:48,826 --> 00:56:51,215
He was a little black dog
with long silky hair...

781
00:56:51,386 --> 00:56:52,978
...and small black eyes
that twinkled merrily...

782
00:56:53,146 --> 00:56:55,819
...on either side
of his funny wee nose. "

783
00:56:58,466 --> 00:57:01,583
Toto? Oh, Toto, don't be scared.

784
00:57:01,746 --> 00:57:03,657
You're just not in Kansas anymore.

785
00:57:04,706 --> 00:57:06,424
Oh, Toto.

786
00:57:09,106 --> 00:57:11,301
Toto, come out from under there.

787
00:57:11,506 --> 00:57:12,655
You're gonna get me in trouble.

788
00:57:14,226 --> 00:57:16,217
It's me. Open the door.

789
00:57:16,386 --> 00:57:17,739
Just a minute.

790
00:57:18,866 --> 00:57:21,938
And not another sound. I mean it.

791
00:57:28,426 --> 00:57:31,145
I'm sorry, I had no choice.

792
00:57:31,306 --> 00:57:32,944
But, look, it's Basta.

793
00:57:33,426 --> 00:57:37,385
And I'm sorry, but I'm afraid all the
henchmen blend into one, even to me.

794
00:57:37,546 --> 00:57:40,219
Hello, princess. Where's your father?

795
00:57:40,386 --> 00:57:42,058
Told him he'd gone,
but they don't believe me.

796
00:57:42,226 --> 00:57:44,660
- You told them?
- He held a knife to my throat.

797
00:57:44,826 --> 00:57:47,499
Isn't he awful?
And they don't believe I'm the author.

798
00:57:47,666 --> 00:57:50,863
Tell us where Silvertongue is
before I kill you both.

799
00:57:52,466 --> 00:57:53,581
Toto, no!

800
00:57:54,506 --> 00:57:55,985
Toto?

801
00:57:56,746 --> 00:57:59,260
Oh, my goodness!

802
00:57:59,426 --> 00:58:02,384
She's inherited her father's gift.

803
00:58:05,147 --> 00:58:06,899
Another Silvertongue.

804
00:58:07,107 --> 00:58:09,177
Old Capricorn will be pleased.

805
00:58:12,787 --> 00:58:14,061
Bring them both.

806
00:58:22,547 --> 00:58:25,266
So if Darius read her out of the book...

807
00:58:25,427 --> 00:58:28,146
Oh, no, no, no. She's fine.

808
00:58:29,147 --> 00:58:30,819
- Mostly. She...
- Mostly?

809
00:58:32,507 --> 00:58:33,906
She's got no voice.

810
00:58:34,987 --> 00:58:37,899
- What?
- He read her out last spring...

811
00:58:39,187 --> 00:58:40,461
...and she has no voice.

812
00:58:41,907 --> 00:58:43,818
But apart from that, she's fine.

813
00:58:50,507 --> 00:58:53,021
- Pull over.
- For what?

814
00:58:53,587 --> 00:58:57,262
- Just pull over.
- That makes sense, you speaking weasel.

815
00:59:04,387 --> 00:59:06,378
I thought I told you to stay
with the old man.

816
00:59:06,547 --> 00:59:08,105
But he's mean.

817
00:59:08,747 --> 00:59:10,578
Not as mean as Capricorn.

818
00:59:11,547 --> 00:59:14,983
He doesn't scare me.
I was raised by murderers and thieves.

819
00:59:15,147 --> 00:59:16,705
Well, he should scare you.

820
00:59:18,867 --> 00:59:21,665
- I should make you walk back.
- I'd only follow you.

821
00:59:28,868 --> 00:59:29,903
Get in.

822
00:59:30,068 --> 00:59:31,899
After this,
you teach me Dragon's Breath...

823
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:34,059
Just get in the car.

824
00:59:41,788 --> 00:59:43,983
Hello, Mr. Fenoglio?

825
00:59:59,828 --> 01:00:02,183
Oh.

826
01:00:20,108 --> 01:00:22,064
These guys are just
circling the perimeter.

827
01:00:22,548 --> 01:00:24,220
We should move in now.

828
01:00:24,468 --> 01:00:26,026
When we get to maid's quarters...

829
01:00:26,188 --> 01:00:29,066
...Resa's room is the third door
on the right when we go in back.

830
01:00:29,228 --> 01:00:31,981
I'll go in the back. You guys cover me.

831
01:00:36,988 --> 01:00:39,183
All right, this is our way in.

832
01:00:39,348 --> 01:00:43,182
Now, listen, this is going to
be dangerous so you need to keep up.

833
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,100
Got to move quickly.

834
01:00:53,469 --> 01:00:54,982
After you.

835
01:01:04,949 --> 01:01:06,143
Shall we rest?

836
01:01:08,149 --> 01:01:11,346
No, that's okay. Just keep moving.

837
01:01:12,509 --> 01:01:15,182
- Kids.
- No, I'm fine.

838
01:01:18,709 --> 01:01:20,700
What was that?
Where?

839
01:01:21,429 --> 01:01:22,657
There!

840
01:01:22,829 --> 01:01:24,057
- Over there!
Shoot him!

841
01:01:24,229 --> 01:01:26,538
- Bring him down!
Thanks.

842
01:01:28,589 --> 01:01:31,467
They're there behind the square.
Oh, no.

843
01:01:31,629 --> 01:01:33,108
Well, come on. Quick.

844
01:01:37,069 --> 01:01:39,867
Hurry! Go on!
Head him off at the square!

845
01:01:42,589 --> 01:01:44,705
Don't let him get away!

846
01:02:47,350 --> 01:02:49,910
Look. Look at this.
Look at the Dragon's Breath.

847
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:52,106
I think I got it. Here, feel my hand.

848
01:02:54,990 --> 01:02:57,424
It's been too long.
I'm going to see if he's all right.

849
01:02:57,590 --> 01:02:59,660
Come on.
We'll find him.

850
01:03:01,710 --> 01:03:03,302
He's not far away.

851
01:03:05,910 --> 01:03:08,299
- Well done. Thank you.
- My pleasure.

852
01:03:15,510 --> 01:03:18,149
Look who's back. This is nice.

853
01:03:20,750 --> 01:03:22,786
Just in time for your execution.

854
01:03:28,510 --> 01:03:30,023
All right.

855
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:35,662
Capricorn's castle
is like a five-star hotel.

856
01:03:35,830 --> 01:03:38,390
Not for you, obviously.
You'll be locked in the crypt.

857
01:03:38,550 --> 01:03:41,941
But some of our guests
get a room with a view.

858
01:03:46,391 --> 01:03:47,619
Resa.

859
01:03:47,871 --> 01:03:49,020
Sorry.

860
01:03:49,191 --> 01:03:51,659
Listen, your husband's here.

861
01:03:53,231 --> 01:03:54,300
He's come to rescue you.

862
01:04:15,151 --> 01:04:16,743
That way! That way!

863
01:04:27,791 --> 01:04:29,349
There!

864
01:04:29,511 --> 01:04:30,580
Come on!

865
01:04:30,751 --> 01:04:31,820
What happened?

866
01:04:31,991 --> 01:04:33,902
They're going to kill Dustfinger.

867
01:04:34,071 --> 01:04:35,060
Shh, shh.

868
01:04:35,231 --> 01:04:37,586
Here.
- They're going to kill him, it's my fault.

869
01:04:37,751 --> 01:04:39,025
No, it's not. What happened?

870
01:04:43,031 --> 01:04:44,703
All the letters of the alphabet.

871
01:04:44,871 --> 01:04:46,623
It looks just like my book.

872
01:04:46,791 --> 01:04:49,100
It's like walking into
my own imagination.

873
01:04:49,271 --> 01:04:51,546
I wonder what Capricorn's
going to make you read.

874
01:04:51,711 --> 01:04:53,269
I hope it's something good.

875
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,899
I'm excited, I am. Are you, eh?

876
01:04:58,431 --> 01:05:00,786
<i>"'What raft, Jim? ' 'Our old raft. '</i>

877
01:05:00,951 --> 01:05:03,785
'You mean to say our old raft
wasn't smashed all to flinders? '"

878
01:05:19,472 --> 01:05:20,541
I'm convinced.

879
01:05:22,872 --> 01:05:25,705
Though I don't know what that poor boy
will do without his raft.

880
01:05:28,112 --> 01:05:30,387
- No.
- I'm tired of doing stupid tricks for you.

881
01:05:30,552 --> 01:05:31,826
Tell me where my father is.

882
01:05:31,992 --> 01:05:34,711
I have absolutely no idea.

883
01:05:34,872 --> 01:05:38,626
Quite frankly, I don't care, because
you read just as well as he does.

884
01:05:45,152 --> 01:05:46,790
What are you gawking at?

885
01:05:46,952 --> 01:05:49,102
You're just as I wrote you.

886
01:05:49,592 --> 01:05:50,866
A cowardly thug.

887
01:05:51,392 --> 01:05:53,428
How dare you.

888
01:05:54,392 --> 01:05:56,542
You'll pay for your filthy story!

889
01:06:01,072 --> 01:06:03,347
Only the king can pull it out.

890
01:06:03,512 --> 01:06:06,072
Don't you remember?

891
01:06:07,752 --> 01:06:10,471
Don't you ever laugh at me.

892
01:06:12,792 --> 01:06:15,829
Get it away from me. I want it
executed with the others.

893
01:06:15,992 --> 01:06:19,348
The dog? You want the dog executed?

894
01:06:19,992 --> 01:06:24,622
As for you, we'll see how you enamored
of your creations you are...

895
01:06:24,792 --> 01:06:27,512
...when The Shadow
is flaying the skin off your back.

896
01:06:27,673 --> 01:06:31,666
You can't bring it out of the book.
You burnt the last copy. I saw you do it.

897
01:06:34,393 --> 01:06:35,826
Wrong.

898
01:06:37,113 --> 01:06:39,183
I saved a copy of the book for myself.

899
01:06:39,353 --> 01:06:41,025
Aren't I full of surprises?

900
01:06:47,473 --> 01:06:51,671
No, I couldn't burn them all, could I?

901
01:06:52,313 --> 01:06:54,873
Not with my old friend trapped inside.

902
01:06:55,033 --> 01:06:56,625
Oh, you are going to love him.

903
01:06:56,793 --> 01:07:01,708
And by love,
I mean cower in terror from.

904
01:07:01,873 --> 01:07:04,307
You see, I love this world...

905
01:07:04,473 --> 01:07:07,590
...and I intend to write my name
on every page of it.

906
01:07:07,753 --> 01:07:09,232
You...

907
01:07:09,393 --> 01:07:11,827
...and The Shadow are going to help me
do just that.

908
01:07:15,353 --> 01:07:17,105
I won't read anything for you.

909
01:07:17,913 --> 01:07:19,346
Oh, really?

910
01:07:21,233 --> 01:07:26,023
Let me show you what happens
to those who disobey me around here.

911
01:07:27,033 --> 01:07:29,183
She's been very naughty, this one.

912
01:07:29,913 --> 01:07:31,983
Tiresome in the extreme.

913
01:07:32,153 --> 01:07:33,427
Always trying to escape.

914
01:07:34,073 --> 01:07:35,586
So I'm putting an end to it.

915
01:07:37,073 --> 01:07:39,541
<i>- Meggie.
- Mum.</i>

916
01:07:42,193 --> 01:07:43,512
It's you.

917
01:07:43,673 --> 01:07:48,110
Mo's here. We're going to get out.
We're going to escape. We'll all escape.

918
01:07:48,793 --> 01:07:49,943
Well...

919
01:07:53,114 --> 01:07:56,743
...what a touching display of empathy.

920
01:07:57,114 --> 01:07:58,593
"Mum. "

921
01:08:00,154 --> 01:08:01,712
Look at me.

922
01:08:06,674 --> 01:08:08,471
Yes, I can see the resemblance.

923
01:08:10,714 --> 01:08:14,832
Do you still think I can't convince you
to read for me?

924
01:08:20,594 --> 01:08:22,550
No! Mum! Mum!

925
01:08:22,714 --> 01:08:25,274
Please! Please!

926
01:08:29,434 --> 01:08:31,072
<i>Meggie!</i>

927
01:08:34,074 --> 01:08:36,065
Is it too late to make any changes?

928
01:08:36,234 --> 01:08:37,223
Changes?

929
01:08:37,394 --> 01:08:40,909
Thinking perhaps you might be able to
add a few lines, you know what I mean?

930
01:08:41,074 --> 01:08:43,668
I don't need to be some great beauty,
or anything.

931
01:08:43,834 --> 01:08:45,586
I don't know if you noticed my nose.

932
01:08:45,754 --> 01:08:47,472
Oh, your nose. Yes, right.

933
01:08:47,634 --> 01:08:50,387
Think you could do that?
Rewrite things, change things a bit.

934
01:08:50,834 --> 01:08:53,746
I don't know. It's a wonderful idea.

935
01:08:56,754 --> 01:08:58,107
Move.

936
01:09:03,474 --> 01:09:06,068
- What are you doing? Get off me.
- You can't go down there.

937
01:09:06,234 --> 01:09:08,794
- They have my daughter.
- They'll kill her if you do anything.

938
01:09:08,954 --> 01:09:12,344
- I should never have left her alone.
- We have to stay hidden.

939
01:09:22,075 --> 01:09:24,794
Nothing to be frightened of.
It's just dusty old coffins.

940
01:09:24,955 --> 01:09:28,834
If there are any nasty spirits down here,
it's not us they're angry at.

941
01:09:28,995 --> 01:09:33,625
Princess needs to rest
that voice of hers for tonight.

942
01:09:47,235 --> 01:09:50,545
I've seen my mum.
She's a prisoner here.

943
01:09:51,475 --> 01:09:52,464
I know.

944
01:09:54,235 --> 01:09:55,987
Have you seen my dad?

945
01:09:56,155 --> 01:09:57,270
Yeah, he's fine.

946
01:09:58,835 --> 01:10:00,905
Capricorn's got another copy
of the book.

947
01:10:02,875 --> 01:10:05,469
He's gonna make me
read The Shadow out of it.

948
01:10:07,475 --> 01:10:09,431
I have Mo's gift.

949
01:10:10,115 --> 01:10:11,343
I can do it.

950
01:10:12,435 --> 01:10:14,585
Well, then you could read me back.

951
01:10:15,035 --> 01:10:16,946
"One moonlit night...

952
01:10:17,115 --> 01:10:20,744
...The Shadow
turned on his despicable... "

953
01:10:24,795 --> 01:10:26,274
Make him kill Capricorn.

954
01:10:26,435 --> 01:10:28,312
Make The Shadow do it.

955
01:10:29,275 --> 01:10:31,505
Food for the little princess.

956
01:10:34,715 --> 01:10:37,435
Capricorn wants you to have
your strength for tonight.

957
01:10:37,596 --> 01:10:39,666
You should stay.
We're telling ghost stories.

958
01:10:40,516 --> 01:10:42,552
Right. You don't like
ghost stories, do you?

959
01:10:42,716 --> 01:10:44,627
I'll give you ghost stories, you...!

960
01:10:48,956 --> 01:10:50,230
Get it off of me!

961
01:10:56,196 --> 01:10:57,424
My pouch!

962
01:10:58,756 --> 01:11:00,553
You don't have your good luck charm.

963
01:11:00,716 --> 01:11:01,785
Give me that back!

964
01:11:01,956 --> 01:11:03,753
Why don't you come in and get it?

965
01:11:06,036 --> 01:11:07,025
What are you doing?

966
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:10,393
Someone's got to get us out,
and I don't think it'll be the writer.

967
01:11:12,436 --> 01:11:13,755
You give that back to me.

968
01:11:13,916 --> 01:11:15,110
You be careful.

969
01:11:16,436 --> 01:11:18,472
Maybe I don't need my good luck.

970
01:11:18,876 --> 01:11:20,548
Time to finish what we started.

971
01:11:26,756 --> 01:11:29,907
By the bones of the dead man
in this coffin, I curse you.

972
01:11:30,076 --> 01:11:32,306
Don't you say that. Take that back!

973
01:11:32,476 --> 01:11:35,513
May his spirit haunt your every step.

974
01:11:35,676 --> 01:11:36,665
You take that back!

975
01:11:46,236 --> 01:11:48,625
Open this gate.
Hurry up. Quickly.

976
01:11:48,796 --> 01:11:50,024
- Open the gate.
Come on.

977
01:11:50,196 --> 01:11:51,549
Let me out.

978
01:11:53,036 --> 01:11:55,834
- Which one?
- Help! The prisoners are escaping!

979
01:11:56,476 --> 01:11:57,670
The fire! Use your fire!

980
01:11:57,836 --> 01:11:59,667
Come on, hurry up.

981
01:12:01,437 --> 01:12:03,792
Help! The prisoners are escaping!

982
01:12:04,597 --> 01:12:06,349
The prisoners are escaping!

983
01:12:06,517 --> 01:12:07,506
Come on!

984
01:12:07,997 --> 01:12:09,316
Come on.

985
01:12:09,477 --> 01:12:11,752
The prisoners are escaping! Help!

986
01:12:12,357 --> 01:12:13,551
Help! Quick!

987
01:12:13,717 --> 01:12:14,706
I'm sorry, I can't.

988
01:12:15,677 --> 01:12:17,554
- I can't, I'm sorry.
- Stay!

989
01:12:17,717 --> 01:12:18,706
Don't go.

990
01:12:18,877 --> 01:12:21,755
You don't have to be selfish
just because that's how I wrote you!

991
01:12:21,917 --> 01:12:24,147
You're more than that!
You said so yourself!

992
01:12:24,317 --> 01:12:25,545
Stay and help us!

993
01:12:31,997 --> 01:12:33,430
Help!

994
01:12:34,877 --> 01:12:37,471
The prisoners are escaping! Help!

995
01:12:46,557 --> 01:12:48,309
Check all the courtyards!

996
01:12:48,477 --> 01:12:49,592
Let me out!

997
01:13:12,317 --> 01:13:14,228
<i>Don't leave! Come back!</i>

998
01:13:16,317 --> 01:13:17,432
Oh, God.

999
01:13:22,557 --> 01:13:26,233
This is quite possibly the most stupid
thing you've ever done in your life, Elinor.

1000
01:13:26,398 --> 01:13:28,628
There are a bunch of
murderous thugs up there.

1001
01:13:28,798 --> 01:13:31,631
You think you're going to just walk in
and tell them what to do?

1002
01:13:31,798 --> 01:13:33,675
Very likely to listen to you, aren't they?

1003
01:13:33,838 --> 01:13:36,591
Silly old bookworm
with your head in the clouds.

1004
01:13:49,278 --> 01:13:51,189
- Thank you.
- You're alive.

1005
01:13:51,358 --> 01:13:52,791
Thank you.

1006
01:13:53,118 --> 01:13:55,507
All right. All right.
All right, that's enough.

1007
01:13:55,678 --> 01:13:57,748
Did you find them?
Resa, Meggie, how are they?

1008
01:13:57,918 --> 01:13:59,192
- They're fine.
- Good.

1009
01:13:59,358 --> 01:14:00,632
For now.

1010
01:14:01,118 --> 01:14:04,076
- But Capricorn has a copy of the book.
- He what?

1011
01:14:04,958 --> 01:14:06,550
He kept one secretly.

1012
01:14:07,398 --> 01:14:11,994
That was always his plan, to have
The Shadow read out of the book.

1013
01:14:12,958 --> 01:14:16,633
I can't read The Shadow out.
That would kill us all.

1014
01:14:16,798 --> 01:14:18,390
He doesn't need you anymore.

1015
01:14:20,318 --> 01:14:21,876
He found someone else.

1016
01:14:22,398 --> 01:14:23,672
Meggie.

1017
01:14:23,838 --> 01:14:25,191
Meggie?

1018
01:14:37,638 --> 01:14:38,787
Having writer's block?

1019
01:14:39,998 --> 01:14:41,272
Maybe I can help.

1020
01:14:41,438 --> 01:14:43,906
Yeah, that's right.
You want to be a writer, don't you?

1021
01:14:44,078 --> 01:14:48,675
- You say that as if it's a bad thing.
- No, no. Just a lonely thing.

1022
01:14:48,839 --> 01:14:50,397
The world you create on the page...

1023
01:14:50,559 --> 01:14:53,232
...seems more friendly and alive
than the world you live in.

1024
01:14:53,719 --> 01:14:55,596
And you wish
you could be there instead.

1025
01:14:57,639 --> 01:14:59,311
You're a clever girl, Meggie.

1026
01:14:59,479 --> 01:15:02,869
I couldn't have hoped for a finer young
lady to be shut up in a crypt with...

1027
01:15:03,039 --> 01:15:05,348
...whilst awaiting my execution.

1028
01:15:06,399 --> 01:15:09,755
Now, I haven't really got
what I need yet...

1029
01:15:09,919 --> 01:15:11,272
...but it's very close.

1030
01:15:15,999 --> 01:15:18,354
Come on, feed us.

1031
01:15:18,519 --> 01:15:21,909
Blast, they're early. Why are they early?
This is most inconvenient.

1032
01:15:22,079 --> 01:15:25,594
Put one here somewhere. The words
have to be perfect or it won't work.

1033
01:15:25,759 --> 01:15:29,718
<i>They have to be written by the writer.
It has to sound like Inkheart.</i>

1034
01:15:30,079 --> 01:15:32,070
Ah. Here it is.

1035
01:15:34,719 --> 01:15:35,947
Here what is?

1036
01:15:36,119 --> 01:15:38,235
Something for her to
remember me by after I'm gone.

1037
01:15:38,399 --> 01:15:39,673
Aw.

1038
01:15:40,319 --> 01:15:44,392
I don't think much
of your crude scribblings, old man.

1039
01:15:45,639 --> 01:15:48,153
Well, you are my crude scribblings,
Magpie...

1040
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:50,833
...so I'd be careful
what I scrumple up if I were you.

1041
01:15:50,999 --> 01:15:54,389
- Where are you taking her?
- To put on her party frock.

1042
01:15:54,559 --> 01:15:57,756
Oh, don't worry, you're invited
to the feast as well.

1043
01:15:57,919 --> 01:16:00,956
We wouldn't eat without you.
In fact, you're the main course.

1044
01:16:01,279 --> 01:16:04,908
The Shadow will be feeding on you
and that maid later tonight...

1045
01:16:05,079 --> 01:16:08,833
...so rest assured
somebody will be back to fetch you.

1046
01:16:14,400 --> 01:16:16,994
You wanted to be alone,
didn't you? Well, here you are.

1047
01:16:17,160 --> 01:16:18,639
Alone in the wilderness.

1048
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:21,234
Mosquito bites and blisters and...

1049
01:16:22,040 --> 01:16:24,156
Oh, God.

1050
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:27,714
And do you have a plan? No, no plan.

1051
01:16:27,880 --> 01:16:30,872
Just rent a motorbike, find a map.

1052
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:32,951
We'll figure it out when we get there.

1053
01:16:35,800 --> 01:16:36,949
- This is the plan.
- Good.

1054
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,951
You use your fire
and create a distraction.

1055
01:16:39,120 --> 01:16:40,633
I can set fire to the castle.

1056
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:42,028
I can help too.

1057
01:16:42,200 --> 01:16:43,838
Don't get in my way.

1058
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,355
When Capricorn's men
try to put the fire out...

1059
01:16:47,840 --> 01:16:51,435
...I move in, I rescue Meggie and Resa.
- But we're outnumbered.

1060
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:53,916
- And they have these...
- Guns.

1061
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:57,072
That's why we disguise ourselves
as Black Jackets. Let's go.

1062
01:16:59,320 --> 01:17:00,958
Well, come on, then.

1063
01:17:05,440 --> 01:17:09,752
This really is a beautiful little village.

1064
01:17:11,000 --> 01:17:13,753
But it'll be nice to have something
a bit bigger.

1065
01:17:14,560 --> 01:17:16,278
Stretch out.

1066
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,675
Expand my kingdom's borders.

1067
01:17:20,680 --> 01:17:22,591
That's why I need The Shadow.

1068
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:25,399
And I don't want anyone else escaping.

1069
01:17:37,761 --> 01:17:41,834
If you don't stop shaking,
I'm going to stick you with a pin.

1070
01:17:46,401 --> 01:17:49,632
Do you honestly expect me to read
an entire army out of this book?

1071
01:17:49,801 --> 01:17:51,996
- Do you have a better idea?
- No.

1072
01:17:52,161 --> 01:17:53,276
Thought not.

1073
01:18:02,241 --> 01:18:04,038
Get a move on.

1074
01:18:05,041 --> 01:18:06,394
Go on.

1075
01:18:08,681 --> 01:18:10,080
Yes.

1076
01:18:10,601 --> 01:18:12,034
Come on! Come on!

1077
01:18:22,041 --> 01:18:23,030
Go on.

1078
01:18:31,681 --> 01:18:33,080
Forward.

1079
01:18:35,921 --> 01:18:39,630
Don't try anything funny or
you'll never see your mother alive again.

1080
01:18:43,001 --> 01:18:44,559
Please.

1081
01:18:46,561 --> 01:18:51,954
The time has come to be reunited
with our old friend!

1082
01:19:16,162 --> 01:19:17,277
Well, tie them up, then.

1083
01:19:21,482 --> 01:19:22,961
Good evening.

1084
01:19:24,002 --> 01:19:25,913
Do you want to get out of here?

1085
01:19:27,562 --> 01:19:29,757
Then you're going to have to help me.

1086
01:19:36,962 --> 01:19:39,476
<i>Inkheart! Inkheart! Inkheart!</i>

1087
01:19:39,642 --> 01:19:41,041
Read it!

1088
01:19:42,042 --> 01:19:43,600
Read the words!

1089
01:19:46,042 --> 01:19:47,475
<i>Inkheart!</i>

1090
01:19:50,042 --> 01:19:52,237
Say the words!

1091
01:20:00,042 --> 01:20:01,919
You're very good at that.

1092
01:20:05,282 --> 01:20:07,750
Doesn't mean we're friends or anything.

1093
01:20:10,242 --> 01:20:12,756
Read it!
Read it!

1094
01:20:12,922 --> 01:20:14,401
<i>Inkheart!</i>

1095
01:20:18,002 --> 01:20:18,991
Read it!

1096
01:20:21,122 --> 01:20:22,636
I got it. Here.

1097
01:20:24,563 --> 01:20:27,157
"Capricorn led an army of brutal men...

1098
01:20:27,323 --> 01:20:31,953
...who struck fear in the hearts and minds
of all those they came in contact with.

1099
01:20:33,723 --> 01:20:35,361
- Whenever they passed by...
- Resa.

1100
01:20:35,523 --> 01:20:38,879
...people closed their doors
and hid with their children.

1101
01:20:51,603 --> 01:20:53,992
But of all the villains
lurking in the Wayless Wood...

1102
01:20:54,163 --> 01:20:58,839
...the one most feared and reviled
was known simply as The Shadow. "

1103
01:20:59,923 --> 01:21:01,515
The Shadow.

1104
01:21:03,323 --> 01:21:05,757
"Made from the ashes
of Capricorn's victims...

1105
01:21:05,923 --> 01:21:08,312
...The Shadow
was immortal and invulnerable...

1106
01:21:09,283 --> 01:21:11,638
...and as pitiless as his master.

1107
01:21:14,403 --> 01:21:16,473
His fingers and even his breath
brought death...

1108
01:21:16,643 --> 01:21:19,840
...scenting his way
like a hound on the trail. "

1109
01:21:30,603 --> 01:21:32,958
"He appears only
when Capricorn calls him...

1110
01:21:33,123 --> 01:21:35,683
...rising from the ground,
a faceless and fiery beast.

1111
01:21:35,843 --> 01:21:38,801
- No. Stop reading. Stop.
- Eager to consume his next victim. "

1112
01:21:43,043 --> 01:21:44,271
Stop reading, Meggie.

1113
01:21:46,004 --> 01:21:47,198
Meggie, stop reading!

1114
01:22:26,884 --> 01:22:27,919
Beautiful.

1115
01:22:31,684 --> 01:22:32,912
Feast.

1116
01:22:35,964 --> 01:22:37,477
Mum!

1117
01:22:40,404 --> 01:22:41,439
Shadow!

1118
01:22:42,244 --> 01:22:44,883
- Shadow!
Toto! Good boy.

1119
01:22:51,684 --> 01:22:53,083
Mum!

1120
01:22:53,964 --> 01:22:54,953
Feast.

1121
01:23:01,044 --> 01:23:04,639
"Yet one starlit night,
The Shadow heard a different voice.

1122
01:23:04,804 --> 01:23:07,841
The voice of a girl, and when
she called his name, he remembered. "

1123
01:23:08,004 --> 01:23:08,994
Take that book!

1124
01:23:09,165 --> 01:23:11,759
"He remembered all those
from whose ashes he was made.

1125
01:23:11,925 --> 01:23:14,200
All the pain and all the grief.

1126
01:23:15,125 --> 01:23:17,844
The Shadow remembered,
and he was determined to take revenge.

1127
01:23:18,005 --> 01:23:21,714
Revenge on those whose cruelty
was the cause of all this misfortune. "

1128
01:23:21,885 --> 01:23:24,160
- Make her stop.
- " Shadow went to his master...

1129
01:23:24,325 --> 01:23:27,203
...and reached out to him
with ashen hands. "

1130
01:23:28,805 --> 01:23:31,524
That's not right!
Take it away!

1131
01:23:35,045 --> 01:23:38,401
That's not the book.
Those aren't the real words.

1132
01:23:38,565 --> 01:23:41,284
Stop her. Somebody stop her reading!

1133
01:23:42,245 --> 01:23:43,997
- Stop her!
Meggie, watch out!

1134
01:23:44,925 --> 01:23:46,244
Mo!

1135
01:23:48,325 --> 01:23:49,758
Mo!

1136
01:23:50,845 --> 01:23:53,120
- Give that here!
Give it back!

1137
01:23:59,965 --> 01:24:01,876
What a pleasant turn of events.

1138
01:24:05,125 --> 01:24:09,596
Silvertongue,
you're just in time for dinner!

1139
01:24:17,805 --> 01:24:19,204
No!

1140
01:24:20,005 --> 01:24:21,757
Not my castle!

1141
01:24:22,245 --> 01:24:24,554
Attack!

1142
01:24:29,445 --> 01:24:33,075
Attack!

1143
01:24:39,366 --> 01:24:40,879
- Get off!
Get out of my way!

1144
01:24:46,126 --> 01:24:47,639
Resa.

1145
01:24:49,126 --> 01:24:51,037
No! Get off!

1146
01:24:51,206 --> 01:24:52,480
What...! No!

1147
01:24:58,726 --> 01:25:01,763
You think these misfits can conquer me?

1148
01:25:02,006 --> 01:25:04,281
Go! Devour her!

1149
01:25:05,566 --> 01:25:08,717
- You'll have to get past me first!
- Watch out, Mo!

1150
01:25:11,006 --> 01:25:11,995
Just keep reading!

1151
01:25:12,166 --> 01:25:13,519
What?
Keep reading!

1152
01:25:13,686 --> 01:25:15,722
I can't! There's nothing left to read.

1153
01:25:17,086 --> 01:25:18,075
Then write.

1154
01:25:25,926 --> 01:25:27,644
Come on, Meggie!

1155
01:25:28,446 --> 01:25:29,674
You can do it!

1156
01:25:29,846 --> 01:25:32,280
The Shadow turned away
from the innocent.

1157
01:25:32,446 --> 01:25:33,925
Come on, Meggie.

1158
01:25:38,686 --> 01:25:40,916
"The Shadow turned away
from the innocent.

1159
01:25:43,366 --> 01:25:47,279
And back to the evil master
who had controlled him all these years.

1160
01:25:50,406 --> 01:25:54,558
The Shadow reached out to him
with ashen hands.

1161
01:25:55,366 --> 01:26:00,157
And as it did, Capricorn began to crackle
and fade like the old page of a book...

1162
01:26:01,367 --> 01:26:04,245
...growing transparent
and thin as paper. "

1163
01:26:06,567 --> 01:26:08,319
I won't let you!

1164
01:26:10,887 --> 01:26:12,320
Dad!

1165
01:26:15,967 --> 01:26:18,800
"Capricorn's ink-black soul
filled with terror...

1166
01:26:19,647 --> 01:26:20,966
...as he saw the end was near.

1167
01:26:21,927 --> 01:26:25,363
And so, too, did the souls of all those
within The Shadow's gaze...

1168
01:26:25,527 --> 01:26:27,643
...who'd committed villainy
in Capricorn's name.

1169
01:26:27,807 --> 01:26:31,117
And then they blew away,
like ashes in the wind. "

1170
01:26:33,767 --> 01:26:35,200
Stop! Help!

1171
01:26:42,647 --> 01:26:44,000
No!

1172
01:26:52,967 --> 01:26:57,677
"While the terrible monster himself
disintegrated and was no more. "

1173
01:27:17,327 --> 01:27:19,398
It's Meggie. She's reading.

1174
01:27:19,568 --> 01:27:22,685
They're going back into their books.
I'm going to miss it!

1175
01:27:22,848 --> 01:27:25,282
I don't want to go back
into my stinking book.

1176
01:27:25,528 --> 01:27:29,601
"Those who'd been summoned against
their will, who were in sight of the girl...

1177
01:27:29,768 --> 01:27:33,044
...were set free, and set right
and sent back from whence they came. "

1178
01:27:37,288 --> 01:27:39,848
Mo. Mo!

1179
01:27:46,448 --> 01:27:47,847
Toto?

1180
01:27:51,488 --> 01:27:52,477
Meggie!

1181
01:27:53,408 --> 01:27:56,081
Please, set me free.

1182
01:27:56,248 --> 01:27:58,523
"And the old creator
finally got his wish...

1183
01:27:58,688 --> 01:28:01,248
...disappearing into the world
he had only dreamed about.

1184
01:28:06,088 --> 01:28:10,684
And then, finally, after what seemed
almost a lifetime of wishing...

1185
01:28:11,968 --> 01:28:14,562
...the young girl finally got
her most heartfelt dream.

1186
01:28:14,728 --> 01:28:18,084
While the mother she knew she'd see
again and the father she cherished...

1187
01:28:18,248 --> 01:28:19,237
Meggie.

1188
01:28:19,408 --> 01:28:22,400
...came running
to embrace their only... "

1189
01:28:28,928 --> 01:28:30,884
Darling, I missed you.

1190
01:28:36,968 --> 01:28:37,957
What happened?

1191
01:28:38,568 --> 01:28:39,967
I missed it.

1192
01:28:41,768 --> 01:28:43,361
I missed it. They're all gone.

1193
01:28:44,969 --> 01:28:46,561
I got here too late to go home.

1194
01:28:47,369 --> 01:28:49,599
He'll never read me back in now.

1195
01:28:50,089 --> 01:28:52,728
He said he'd try.
After he got his wife back.

1196
01:28:54,249 --> 01:28:58,083
Well, he won't.
He'd never risk losing her again.

1197
01:29:06,889 --> 01:29:08,641
And I wouldn't make him.

1198
01:29:11,849 --> 01:29:16,127
Stop it, Elinor.
It's so silly to cry at happy endings.

1199
01:29:16,729 --> 01:29:17,718
Come here.

1200
01:29:25,769 --> 01:29:26,838
Dustfinger.

1201
01:29:29,129 --> 01:29:30,687
Dustfinger?

1202
01:29:31,969 --> 01:29:34,722
Let's go. Come on, it's time to go.

1203
01:29:35,209 --> 01:29:38,360
- Let's run. Come on. Meggie.
- Meggie, quickly. Come on.

1204
01:29:38,529 --> 01:29:39,803
The book's gone.

1205
01:29:39,969 --> 01:29:43,166
- We don't need it.
- Great. I'll have nightmares for weeks.

1206
01:29:43,489 --> 01:29:45,286
Come on.
Come on.

1207
01:29:50,409 --> 01:29:51,637
You're all right?

1208
01:30:22,250 --> 01:30:24,286
You were going to leave without me?

1209
01:30:24,450 --> 01:30:25,929
Oh, no.

1210
01:30:26,770 --> 01:30:29,921
- You're better off with them.
- Well, if you're going...

1211
01:30:30,410 --> 01:30:32,560
...you should probably
bring this with you.

1212
01:30:44,330 --> 01:30:45,445
You stole this?

1213
01:30:45,610 --> 01:30:48,966
I learned from the best.
I thought maybe we could find someone.

1214
01:30:49,450 --> 01:30:52,487
Another reader.
Someone who could send you back.

1215
01:30:55,050 --> 01:30:56,324
What about that girl?

1216
01:30:57,130 --> 01:31:00,884
You like her, don't you? You come
with me, you may never see her again.

1217
01:31:01,810 --> 01:31:05,405
I stole photo from Silvertongue's pocket.

1218
01:31:12,490 --> 01:31:17,484
Well, if I'm going to be
saddled with you...

1219
01:31:17,650 --> 01:31:19,368
...you can make yourself useful.

1220
01:31:21,570 --> 01:31:23,367
We got a long walk ahead of us.

1221
01:31:27,650 --> 01:31:28,639
Dustfinger.

1222
01:31:33,011 --> 01:31:34,569
Dustfinger!

1223
01:31:39,531 --> 01:31:40,520
I promised.

1224
01:31:42,091 --> 01:31:43,444
It's your turn now.

1225
01:31:43,891 --> 01:31:45,290
Great.

1226
01:31:54,091 --> 01:31:57,322
You sure you want this? You remember
what happens at the end of the book.

1227
01:31:57,491 --> 01:32:00,642
It's like I told the writer.
He doesn't control me.

1228
01:32:00,811 --> 01:32:03,006
My fate's in my own hands now.

1229
01:32:06,131 --> 01:32:07,120
Good luck.

1230
01:32:07,531 --> 01:32:11,604
Hey, don't take this the wrong way,
but don't come back, okay?

1231
01:32:15,691 --> 01:32:17,124
Do it.

1232
01:32:17,971 --> 01:32:19,120
"It had been many years...

1233
01:32:19,291 --> 01:32:23,250
...since Dustfinger had set eyes
on the rolling meadows and the old mill.

1234
01:32:24,211 --> 01:32:27,203
But it was even more beautiful
than he remembered.

1235
01:32:28,131 --> 01:32:30,565
The butterflies flitted
above the grass... "

1236
01:32:59,852 --> 01:33:01,490
He's gone back.

1237
01:33:01,932 --> 01:33:03,047
Where he wants to be.

1238
01:33:03,212 --> 01:33:04,725
What about you?

1239
01:33:05,972 --> 01:33:07,041
I can't follow him.

1240
01:33:08,972 --> 01:33:12,169
Because I've kept Gwin behind,
the end of his story will be different.

1241
01:33:12,652 --> 01:33:13,926
He's not going to die.

1242
01:33:15,052 --> 01:33:16,326
You can stay with us.

1243
01:33:18,372 --> 01:33:20,169
It was Mum's idea.

1244
01:33:20,332 --> 01:33:22,892
Sorry. Shouldn't I have said that?

1245
01:33:25,012 --> 01:33:27,367
Just don't expect me to read you back.

1246
01:33:27,972 --> 01:33:30,725
- You can teach me to read?
- Yeah.

1247
01:33:30,892 --> 01:33:32,325
Maybe.

1248
01:33:35,172 --> 01:33:36,924
I can teach you Dragon's Breath.

1249
01:34:03,052 --> 01:34:04,644
Roxanne!

1250
01:34:05,932 --> 01:34:07,570
Roxanne.

1251
01:34:09,292 --> 01:34:16,286
Resync: Xenzai[NEF]

1252
01:34:17,292 --> 01:34:22,286
THE END
