1
00:03:56,591 --> 00:03:59,399
Cheers!

2
00:04:07,643 --> 00:04:09,099
Excellent.

3
00:04:09,693 --> 00:04:12,015
Let's drink until we drop.

4
00:04:12,334 --> 00:04:14,028
Save something for your wife.

5
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:17,125
Are you kidding?

6
00:04:17,512 --> 00:04:19,942
Alcohol revives me.

7
00:04:20,154 --> 00:04:22,821
The later it gets, the hornier I get.

8
00:04:23,177 --> 00:04:26,956
Another glass. A little sip.

9
00:04:30,336 --> 00:04:32,173
Tell me, Jane...

10
00:04:32,735 --> 00:04:34,086
What year are you in?

11
00:04:34,473 --> 00:04:35,159
4th year.

12
00:04:35,375 --> 00:04:37,661
A senior should know better.

13
00:04:37,913 --> 00:04:40,449
What are you doing with Tun?

14
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:42,180
He's a hunk.

15
00:04:42,432 --> 00:04:45,002
You keep saying that.

16
00:04:45,245 --> 00:04:47,983
Making Jim ask for girl's numbers.

17
00:04:48,235 --> 00:04:48,994
Then breaking their hearts.

18
00:04:49,242 --> 00:04:52,713
Speaking of broken hearts...

19
00:04:52,927 --> 00:04:54,384
Remember the time...

20
00:04:54,595 --> 00:04:57,961
that girl left him a drunken mess.

21
00:04:58,314 --> 00:04:59,321
Her name was Kay.

22
00:04:59,564 --> 00:05:01,295
Ignore them.

23
00:05:03,353 --> 00:05:05,533
Wait. I have a question.

24
00:05:05,855 --> 00:05:07,798
How can a guy like you get married?

25
00:05:08,009 --> 00:05:09,502
What's wrong with me?

26
00:05:10,235 --> 00:05:12,901
After a long tiring day...

27
00:05:13,293 --> 00:05:14,915
I want to head home...

28
00:05:15,274 --> 00:05:17,668
to a wife's embrace or a pet's face.

29
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,408
Not waste my life...

30
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,144
partying with you losers.

31
00:05:22,398 --> 00:05:24,093
Not with me.

32
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,177
A good man...

33
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,067
who went whoring with me last night.

34
00:05:30,704 --> 00:05:32,435
Fooling around so soon?

35
00:05:33,903 --> 00:05:35,216
Here she comes.

36
00:05:37,863 --> 00:05:38,550
Quiet.

37
00:05:38,768 --> 00:05:39,870
What's so funny?

38
00:05:41,687 --> 00:05:42,718
Nothing.

39
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:45,538
One last thing...

40
00:05:46,308 --> 00:05:48,288
One more glass!

41
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:09,485
What are we listening to?

42
00:06:11,887 --> 00:06:13,132
Don't turn it off.

43
00:06:13,348 --> 00:06:14,735
It's beautiful.

44
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,283
You guys seem tight.

45
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:21,192
Do you meet often?

46
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:26,302
What are you looking at?

47
00:06:27,144 --> 00:06:28,567
Beautiful you.

48
00:06:31,038 --> 00:06:32,317
What a sap.

49
00:07:16,184 --> 00:07:17,711
Are you hurt?

50
00:07:19,519 --> 00:07:20,834
Tun...

51
00:07:21,814 --> 00:07:23,401
Is she dead?

52
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,523
Wait!

53
00:07:43,466 --> 00:07:44,709
Drive away.

54
00:07:45,411 --> 00:07:47,105
I said drive away!

55
00:07:48,365 --> 00:07:49,822
Drive away!

56
00:08:00,425 --> 00:08:02,297
Get closer, please.

57
00:08:02,927 --> 00:08:03,935
Okay.

58
00:08:05,012 --> 00:08:06,505
Big smile, Nuch.

59
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:08,692
Or you won't look pretty.

60
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,937
All Science Majors...

61
00:08:19,192 --> 00:08:21,478
gather for a class photo.

62
00:08:22,007 --> 00:08:23,286
They're calling you.

63
00:08:24,370 --> 00:08:25,543
Where's Jane?

64
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:29,581
Taking photos with her friends.

65
00:08:30,766 --> 00:08:33,017
I though maybe you broke up.

66
00:08:33,962 --> 00:08:35,620
Come! Let's go.

67
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:35,259
I phoned but you didn't pick up.

68
00:09:35,652 --> 00:09:36,860
Was it on silent?

69
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:47,946
Nuch asked about you today.

70
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,301
When will you be free?

71
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:55,528
She wants to...

72
00:10:17,808 --> 00:10:19,052
Jane.

73
00:10:20,866 --> 00:10:22,596
How can you act like this?

74
00:10:26,601 --> 00:10:28,674
Pretending nothing happened.

75
00:10:30,945 --> 00:10:32,118
Since that night...

76
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:34,028
I haven't slept soundly.

77
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,904
I'm upset as well.

78
00:10:42,067 --> 00:10:44,495
At least we should have checked.

79
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,730
It was an accident.

80
00:10:50,059 --> 00:10:51,789
That's easy for you to say.

81
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:55,163
You weren't behind the wheel.

82
00:11:07,784 --> 00:11:09,371
- Hi, Ti.
- Hey.

83
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,775
How's business?

84
00:11:12,095 --> 00:11:14,144
With you here this early...

85
00:11:14,562 --> 00:11:16,541
business should be bad.

86
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,221
Are my prints ready?

87
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,000
Yeah. Just a sec.

88
00:11:28,115 --> 00:11:29,217
Here.

89
00:11:53,485 --> 00:11:54,836
Is your processor broken?

90
00:11:56,405 --> 00:11:57,577
Let's see.

91
00:12:02,591 --> 00:12:03,905
The nerve.

92
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:05,543
Nice prints and you're great.

93
00:12:05,754 --> 00:12:08,289
If they suck, it's my fault.

94
00:12:08,673 --> 00:12:10,131
Let's check the negative.

95
00:12:11,142 --> 00:12:12,421
No way.

96
00:12:12,635 --> 00:12:14,022
I took them. I should know.

97
00:12:14,269 --> 00:12:15,407
We'll see.

98
00:12:17,884 --> 00:12:19,020
See.

99
00:12:20,385 --> 00:12:22,115
Your negative are bad.

100
00:12:46,243 --> 00:12:47,451
Tun.

101
00:12:58,129 --> 00:12:59,586
Tun.

102
00:13:16,966 --> 00:13:18,317
Tun.

103
00:13:20,405 --> 00:13:21,899
Can you hear me?

104
00:15:30,837 --> 00:15:32,188
Help!

105
00:15:33,306 --> 00:15:34,927
Help!

106
00:16:08,928 --> 00:16:11,499
Don't be scared. I'm here now.

107
00:16:32,039 --> 00:16:33,461
What's wrong with your camera?

108
00:16:34,855 --> 00:16:35,863
I don't' know.

109
00:16:36,072 --> 00:16:37,659
The whole roll is ruined.

110
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:42,182
That many?

111
00:16:48,131 --> 00:16:49,754
What are these shadows?

112
00:16:50,842 --> 00:16:52,572
My camera must be broken.

113
00:16:54,735 --> 00:16:56,536
How should I tell Nuch?

114
00:17:00,643 --> 00:17:01,994
Tun...

115
00:17:03,527 --> 00:17:04,983
Look at this picture.

116
00:17:16,595 --> 00:17:17,803
That woman...

117
00:17:18,993 --> 00:17:20,380
Do you think she's dead?

118
00:17:21,147 --> 00:17:22,250
That's enough.

119
00:17:27,786 --> 00:17:30,179
I'll have my camera fixed tomorrow.

120
00:18:35,173 --> 00:18:36,038
Tun...

121
00:18:36,251 --> 00:18:37,637
Look at this picture.

122
00:19:02,455 --> 00:19:04,078
Are you sure it was here?

123
00:19:11,631 --> 00:19:12,567
Excuse me.

124
00:19:12,778 --> 00:19:13,785
What happened?

125
00:19:14,237 --> 00:19:17,779
A few days ago a car hit the billboard.

126
00:19:18,234 --> 00:19:19,513
Must have been drunk.

127
00:19:21,605 --> 00:19:23,654
Was anyone hurt?

128
00:19:24,732 --> 00:19:25,871
No.

129
00:19:26,435 --> 00:19:27,823
Just the broken sign.

130
00:19:28,069 --> 00:19:29,421
Are you sure?

131
00:19:29,667 --> 00:19:30,567
What?

132
00:19:32,102 --> 00:19:33,723
Nothing.

133
00:19:35,089 --> 00:19:36,334
Thank you.

134
00:19:38,392 --> 00:19:39,528
What?

135
00:19:41,798 --> 00:19:44,012
You sure you checked everywhere?

136
00:19:47,671 --> 00:19:49,021
Nothing.

137
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,000
Thanks anyways.

138
00:19:56,082 --> 00:19:58,582
He called every precinct and hospital.

139
00:20:00,251 --> 00:20:03,830
No accidents were reported that night.

140
00:20:04,249 --> 00:20:05,705
That's not possible.

141
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,760
What about the girl we hit?

142
00:20:10,505 --> 00:20:12,826
You sure he called every one?

143
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:14,948
Maybe someone helped her.

144
00:20:15,544 --> 00:20:17,486
Maybe she's fine.

145
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:19,190
How could she be fine?

146
00:20:19,435 --> 00:20:21,272
We ploughed her down.

147
00:20:24,406 --> 00:20:26,136
And even if she's fine...

148
00:20:27,813 --> 00:20:29,542
Something is in those pictures.

149
00:20:30,036 --> 00:20:32,773
I told you they're not related to her.

150
00:20:33,304 --> 00:20:34,477
They're just bad exposures.

151
00:20:34,692 --> 00:20:36,185
Get it?

152
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,237
Tun...

153
00:21:41,942 --> 00:21:43,601
You need to make some merit.

154
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,347
These pictures...

155
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:49,025
show that a spirit is haunting you.

156
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:58,066
How long have you been a photographer?

157
00:21:58,277 --> 00:21:59,971
Why are you showing me these?

158
00:22:00,327 --> 00:22:01,262
I know...

159
00:22:01,787 --> 00:22:04,002
But don't you find these shadows strange?

160
00:22:06,617 --> 00:22:07,969
You want to see spirits?

161
00:22:09,016 --> 00:22:10,295
I'll show you some.

162
00:22:18,608 --> 00:22:19,366
Here.

163
00:22:20,102 --> 00:22:21,275
Auntie Cham's spirit.

164
00:22:22,326 --> 00:22:23,678
You know where she is now?

165
00:22:26,809 --> 00:22:29,689
She's selling grilled bananas next door.

166
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:32,853
Here's Auntie Cham. And here.

167
00:22:33,622 --> 00:22:34,723
All Auntie Cham.

168
00:22:35,290 --> 00:22:36,534
Taken on the same day.

169
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:38,132
They're just double exposures...

170
00:22:38,383 --> 00:22:39,911
and out of focus.

171
00:22:40,885 --> 00:22:43,799
Come on. I know that.

172
00:22:52,459 --> 00:22:54,638
Everyone is familiar with this place.

173
00:22:56,247 --> 00:22:58,605
Just an ordinary location...

174
00:23:00,036 --> 00:23:01,693
that we pass...

175
00:23:02,328 --> 00:23:03,881
and see everyday.

176
00:23:09,662 --> 00:23:11,604
Now look at these pictures...

177
00:23:15,674 --> 00:23:18,588
taken of the same place.

178
00:23:19,462 --> 00:23:20,778
In these...

179
00:23:21,964 --> 00:23:23,587
the bridge looks nicer.

180
00:23:25,892 --> 00:23:27,205
That means photography...

181
00:23:27,664 --> 00:23:32,107
does not reproduce reality.

182
00:23:34,546 --> 00:23:35,896
It depends on how...

183
00:23:36,943 --> 00:23:39,645
the image is framed.

184
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:41,832
What is revealed.

185
00:23:42,227 --> 00:23:43,922
What is concealed.

186
00:23:45,181 --> 00:23:47,883
Your perspective is critical.

187
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:03,381
"Special Scoop: Spirit Pictures"

188
00:24:16,390 --> 00:24:17,846
Jane, you're early.

189
00:24:20,422 --> 00:24:21,701
I'll get it.

190
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:28,650
- Hello?
- Hello, Tun.

191
00:24:28,901 --> 00:24:30,951
It's Jane. I'll come by later.

192
00:24:32,447 --> 00:24:33,170
Hello?

193
00:24:33,420 --> 00:24:35,564
Tun, can you hear me?

194
00:24:35,817 --> 00:24:37,096
Hello?

195
00:24:37,311 --> 00:24:38,625
Tun!

196
00:24:38,875 --> 00:24:40,190
Tun!

197
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:42,063
Hello?

198
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,868
Hello?

199
00:25:12,378 --> 00:25:13,692
What's wrong?

200
00:25:14,534 --> 00:25:15,540
I don't' know.

201
00:25:15,749 --> 00:25:17,798
My neck's hurt since the accident.

202
00:25:18,913 --> 00:25:20,643
You should go see a doctor.

203
00:25:22,631 --> 00:25:23,945
I'm sure it's not serious.

204
00:25:27,531 --> 00:25:29,226
What's the use of talking to these spoofs?

205
00:25:30,971 --> 00:25:33,567
"Real Ghosts"

206
00:25:36,184 --> 00:25:37,642
Are you a reporter?

207
00:25:37,923 --> 00:25:38,989
No.

208
00:25:40,112 --> 00:25:42,682
The funeral foundation sent us.

209
00:25:45,012 --> 00:25:47,298
We run a legal operation.

210
00:25:47,619 --> 00:25:49,455
We have all the right permits.

211
00:26:38,916 --> 00:26:40,019
Excuse me.

212
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,874
Are all these pictures fakes?

213
00:26:44,582 --> 00:26:47,010
Piak! Tell the boss he has guests.

214
00:26:49,968 --> 00:26:51,354
Everyone fakes them.

215
00:26:52,923 --> 00:26:53,989
You know...

216
00:26:54,278 --> 00:26:56,220
these photos are always a hit.

217
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,513
Any issue with them sells out.

218
00:27:00,637 --> 00:27:01,644
But you think...

219
00:27:02,096 --> 00:27:03,862
we can always find real ones?

220
00:27:06,232 --> 00:27:08,483
Isn't that deceiving the public?

221
00:27:09,951 --> 00:27:11,717
Our readers...

222
00:27:12,384 --> 00:27:14,458
want to see scary photos.

223
00:27:15,859 --> 00:27:17,482
They don't want loves stories.

224
00:27:19,300 --> 00:27:22,843
Does that mean every photo is fake?

225
00:27:26,076 --> 00:27:27,983
I didn't say that.

226
00:27:42,098 --> 00:27:43,271
Take a look.

227
00:27:44,288 --> 00:27:45,747
See anything?

228
00:27:46,409 --> 00:27:48,802
This is the first photo I had.

229
00:27:50,093 --> 00:27:51,515
I took it at home.

230
00:27:53,358 --> 00:27:54,638
The shadow...

231
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,494
bears a likeness to my mom.

232
00:28:00,971 --> 00:28:02,737
Believe what you will.

233
00:28:04,932 --> 00:28:06,069
But this picture...

234
00:28:06,913 --> 00:28:09,864
was taken after she passed away.

235
00:28:11,952 --> 00:28:13,410
You know...

236
00:28:13,691 --> 00:28:14,721
sometimes...

237
00:28:14,942 --> 00:28:17,477
spirits long for their loved ones.

238
00:28:23,978 --> 00:28:25,400
In my opinion...

239
00:28:26,307 --> 00:28:27,657
these pictures...

240
00:28:28,877 --> 00:28:30,405
represent more than...

241
00:28:31,067 --> 00:28:33,117
macabre urban legends.

242
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,732
They are signs.

243
00:28:42,537 --> 00:28:43,887
Think about it.

244
00:28:45,248 --> 00:28:46,799
Why would the dead...

245
00:28:47,611 --> 00:28:49,269
return to the living...

246
00:28:52,788 --> 00:28:55,775
Without a message to convey?

247
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:01,682
Most importantly...

248
00:29:02,625 --> 00:29:04,082
I believe...

249
00:29:05,195 --> 00:29:06,689
these shadows...

250
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:10,026
are related to someone in the picture.

251
00:29:14,476 --> 00:29:15,789
A father...

252
00:29:16,179 --> 00:29:17,280
mother...

253
00:29:17,604 --> 00:29:18,990
or lover.

254
00:29:21,182 --> 00:29:22,498
Or someone...

255
00:29:22,712 --> 00:29:24,786
you maligned in life.

256
00:29:48,708 --> 00:29:51,480
How can we tell if they're real...

257
00:29:51,698 --> 00:29:53,084
and not fakes?

258
00:29:53,469 --> 00:29:54,961
What about Polaroid's?

259
00:29:55,172 --> 00:29:56,630
Can you fake them?

260
00:30:00,212 --> 00:30:04,762
You load the film and press the shutter.

261
00:30:05,215 --> 00:30:06,567
The photo ejects.

262
00:30:25,131 --> 00:30:26,861
Tell me then...

263
00:30:27,667 --> 00:30:29,682
How can they be faked?

264
00:30:33,785 --> 00:30:36,487
How do we know what they want?

265
00:30:37,121 --> 00:30:38,151
Perhaps...

266
00:30:38,442 --> 00:30:40,348
the answer is in the photo.

267
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:53,208
Two more poses.

268
00:30:54,115 --> 00:30:55,607
Big smiles.

269
00:30:59,606 --> 00:31:02,272
Let's have a different pose.

270
00:31:02,942 --> 00:31:05,963
Embrace her, hold the bouquet...

271
00:31:06,175 --> 00:31:08,285
and kiss her cheek.

272
00:31:10,762 --> 00:31:11,865
Beautiful.

273
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:15,451
We're done.

274
00:31:15,836 --> 00:31:18,300
Thank you both.

275
00:31:18,756 --> 00:31:21,041
Take them to the dressing room.

276
00:31:47,429 --> 00:31:48,815
What the...

277
00:31:50,694 --> 00:31:52,009
Who's doing that?

278
00:31:52,605 --> 00:31:54,098
Aum, check the fuse!

279
00:31:56,082 --> 00:31:57,538
Hey! Aum!

280
00:32:00,808 --> 00:32:01,673
Aum!

281
00:32:02,998 --> 00:32:04,171
Who's doing that?

282
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:07,549
Is it you, Aum?

283
00:32:14,085 --> 00:32:15,292
Who is it?

284
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,633
Aum, where are you?

285
00:32:21,766 --> 00:32:23,294
Who's there!

286
00:32:23,990 --> 00:32:25,305
I asked who it is!

287
00:32:33,721 --> 00:32:35,378
Where are you, Aum?

288
00:32:40,845 --> 00:32:42,301
Who's there!

289
00:33:33,602 --> 00:33:35,260
Please step off the scale.

290
00:33:38,989 --> 00:33:40,647
Step on it again.

291
00:33:48,789 --> 00:33:50,483
Been working hard lately?

292
00:33:50,736 --> 00:33:52,288
Not really.

293
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:54,452
How long has it hurt?

294
00:33:55,462 --> 00:33:57,369
For quite awhile.

295
00:33:57,583 --> 00:33:59,525
But it's gotten worse lately.

296
00:34:00,016 --> 00:34:02,267
I had a car accident.

297
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:04,213
An accident?

298
00:34:04,881 --> 00:34:06,824
Physically, you're fine.

299
00:34:08,043 --> 00:34:09,429
You shouldn't worry.

300
00:34:10,407 --> 00:34:13,001
But it really hurts.

301
00:34:14,264 --> 00:34:16,516
Your x-rays are normal.

302
00:34:16,871 --> 00:34:18,458
It may be a sprain.

303
00:34:18,817 --> 00:34:20,961
Try the medicine I prescribed.

304
00:34:22,327 --> 00:34:24,472
Mr. Tun, please pick up your prescription.

305
00:34:28,617 --> 00:34:29,896
Take this medicine...

306
00:34:30,286 --> 00:34:32,643
3 times a day after meals...

307
00:34:32,927 --> 00:34:35,250
until the prescription runs out.

308
00:34:37,376 --> 00:34:38,619
Lying bastard.

309
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:40,706
Pardon?

310
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,023
Yes?

311
00:34:43,423 --> 00:34:44,976
Nothing.

312
00:34:49,818 --> 00:34:51,547
Lying bastard.

313
00:34:53,327 --> 00:34:54,679
Lying bastard.

314
00:34:55,864 --> 00:34:57,393
As for this medicine...

315
00:34:59,409 --> 00:35:00,096
Sir!

316
00:35:00,347 --> 00:35:02,291
What's wrong?

317
00:35:05,422 --> 00:35:07,045
...is rarely seen.

318
00:35:07,577 --> 00:35:10,112
When grasshoppers begin mating...

319
00:35:10,635 --> 00:35:13,693
the male smells the female...

320
00:35:14,527 --> 00:35:18,273
from a distance up to 100 meters.

321
00:35:19,115 --> 00:35:22,860
The male carefully approaches the female.

322
00:35:23,668 --> 00:35:26,856
It hooks itself onto her belly.

323
00:35:27,596 --> 00:35:29,467
And they begin to mate.

324
00:35:31,141 --> 00:35:34,990
The female's response is surprising.

325
00:35:36,215 --> 00:35:39,722
The male becomes her prey.

326
00:35:40,385 --> 00:35:44,166
She slowly eats off his head...

327
00:35:44,764 --> 00:35:47,431
while they are mating.

328
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,452
Eventually...

329
00:35:50,672 --> 00:35:52,922
the male succumbs to death.

330
00:36:01,967 --> 00:36:05,402
Excuse me, where is Room 301?

331
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:12,947
Jane.

332
00:36:17,155 --> 00:36:18,646
Jane.

333
00:36:28,485 --> 00:36:29,798
Jane.

334
00:37:41,538 --> 00:37:42,746
Who's there?

335
00:38:12,608 --> 00:38:13,780
Tonn...

336
00:38:14,728 --> 00:38:16,150
What's wrong?

337
00:38:19,871 --> 00:38:20,878
Tun...

338
00:38:21,088 --> 00:38:22,581
I'm going to die.

339
00:38:22,791 --> 00:38:24,485
What's going on?

340
00:38:25,188 --> 00:38:26,326
The photos...

341
00:38:28,003 --> 00:38:29,496
Bring me those photos.

342
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:31,853
What photos?

343
00:38:32,139 --> 00:38:33,206
Are you drunk?

344
00:38:34,954 --> 00:38:36,340
Those photos...

345
00:38:36,797 --> 00:38:38,385
Where did you hide them?

346
00:38:38,639 --> 00:38:39,989
Give them to me.

347
00:38:41,766 --> 00:38:43,259
Remember that bitch.

348
00:38:43,539 --> 00:38:44,570
Calm down.

349
00:38:45,762 --> 00:38:46,628
What photos?

350
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,536
Just give them to me!

351
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:50,692
Please calm down.

352
00:38:51,949 --> 00:38:53,407
Tonn, calm down.

353
00:38:54,244 --> 00:38:55,701
What photos?

354
00:39:01,056 --> 00:39:02,264
Tonn.

355
00:39:02,481 --> 00:39:03,972
I'll call your wife.

356
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:49,878
What are you doing?

357
00:39:51,483 --> 00:39:53,070
Cleaning up.

358
00:39:59,407 --> 00:40:00,900
Your neck still sore?

359
00:40:02,987 --> 00:40:04,195
Yeah.

360
00:40:04,445 --> 00:40:06,590
Take it easy. Don't work so much.

361
00:44:47,971 --> 00:44:49,842
"Natrenapa Chan-ngam, Honor Society 1995"

362
00:45:02,742 --> 00:45:03,949
Tonn.

363
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:06,378
It's Tun.

364
00:45:08,059 --> 00:45:09,586
Are you home?

365
00:45:24,322 --> 00:45:25,460
Tonn.

366
00:45:27,869 --> 00:45:29,420
Are you home?

367
00:45:38,606 --> 00:45:39,815
Tonn.

368
00:46:05,541 --> 00:46:06,820
"Natrenapa Chan-ngam"

369
00:46:55,900 --> 00:46:57,452
Tonn!

370
00:46:58,195 --> 00:46:59,331
Tonn!

371
00:47:01,286 --> 00:47:02,494
Tonn!

372
00:47:09,731 --> 00:47:11,284
Tonn!

373
00:47:48,275 --> 00:47:51,153
I'm really sorry.

374
00:47:52,514 --> 00:47:53,793
Do you know...

375
00:47:54,043 --> 00:47:55,572
What was bothering him?

376
00:47:59,605 --> 00:48:01,193
No. Suddenly he...

377
00:48:01,411 --> 00:48:03,735
It's your gang's fault.

378
00:48:06,173 --> 00:48:07,974
Have you all gone insane?

379
00:48:09,335 --> 00:48:10,994
What do you mean?

380
00:48:12,221 --> 00:48:14,271
You've all committed suicide.

381
00:48:15,661 --> 00:48:16,833
Who?

382
00:48:18,302 --> 00:48:19,795
Don't you know?

383
00:48:20,492 --> 00:48:22,019
The other two...

384
00:48:22,438 --> 00:48:24,547
also killed themselves.

385
00:48:25,289 --> 00:48:26,568
Which two?

386
00:48:29,980 --> 00:48:33,938
The two who sat next to you.

387
00:49:20,096 --> 00:49:21,588
Who's this woman?

388
00:49:26,143 --> 00:49:27,599
Where did you get that?

389
00:49:28,922 --> 00:49:31,068
She's the shadow in the photos, right?

390
00:49:32,780 --> 00:49:33,989
Who is she?

391
00:49:37,019 --> 00:49:39,070
How is she related to you?

392
00:49:58,186 --> 00:50:00,235
I knew her in college.

393
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:05,019
Her name is Natre.

394
00:50:08,751 --> 00:50:10,824
She was a quiet person...

395
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:14,065
without any friends.

396
00:50:18,378 --> 00:50:20,320
We all thought she was weird.

397
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:27,369
I felt sorry for her.

398
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:37,206
We dated but I kept it secret.

399
00:50:40,898 --> 00:50:42,320
She loved me a lot.

400
00:53:40,612 --> 00:53:42,376
She threatened to slit her wrists.

401
00:53:44,260 --> 00:53:45,956
I didn't know what to do.

402
00:53:46,554 --> 00:53:48,320
My friends thought it was funny.

403
00:53:48,849 --> 00:53:50,436
How were they involved?

404
00:53:51,003 --> 00:53:52,353
Why are they dead?

405
00:53:52,985 --> 00:53:54,157
They...

406
00:53:54,373 --> 00:53:55,476
What did they do?

407
00:53:58,023 --> 00:53:59,302
I don't know.

408
00:54:00,735 --> 00:54:03,199
Tonn said he'd take care of it.

409
00:54:07,302 --> 00:54:09,068
After that, Natre disappeared.

410
00:54:10,987 --> 00:54:13,097
I never saw her again.

411
00:54:14,150 --> 00:54:16,329
Didn't you try to stop them?

412
00:54:18,527 --> 00:54:21,300
How could you let it happen?

413
00:54:28,121 --> 00:54:29,672
What could I do?

414
00:54:32,186 --> 00:54:33,880
Now everyone is dead.

415
00:54:37,574 --> 00:54:38,853
I'm...

416
00:54:39,867 --> 00:54:41,454
I'm going to die next.

417
00:55:21,815 --> 00:55:23,166
It's funny how...

418
00:55:25,603 --> 00:55:27,583
we always say...

419
00:55:28,557 --> 00:55:30,393
if we could turn back time...

420
00:55:32,242 --> 00:55:33,213
we...

421
00:55:33,458 --> 00:55:35,509
we would reverse all our wrongs.

422
00:55:39,054 --> 00:55:40,748
Do you think she's okay?

423
00:55:42,251 --> 00:55:43,672
Will she be there?

424
00:55:44,128 --> 00:55:45,264
Go to sleep.

425
00:55:47,985 --> 00:55:49,538
I'll keep you company tonight.

426
00:57:59,356 --> 00:58:00,563
Excuse me.

427
00:58:01,927 --> 00:58:03,420
Do you have any toilet paper?

428
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:41,336
Can I poo first?

429
00:58:41,547 --> 00:58:43,005
I'm sorry.

430
00:59:55,016 --> 00:59:56,297
What's bothering you?

431
01:00:10,726 --> 01:00:12,349
Tun. What's wrong?

432
01:00:24,974 --> 01:00:26,396
What is it?

433
01:01:20,199 --> 01:01:21,514
Is it around here?

434
01:01:32,885 --> 01:01:34,235
Excuse me.

435
01:01:34,867 --> 01:01:36,181
Do you know where this is?

436
01:01:40,773 --> 01:01:42,753
Mom, where is this house?

437
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:19,449
Ma'am.

438
01:02:32,489 --> 01:02:33,626
Excuse me...

439
01:02:33,878 --> 01:02:35,335
Is this Natre's house?

440
01:02:37,389 --> 01:02:38,597
What do you want?

441
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:41,027
Well...

442
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:43,670
We're her friends.

443
01:02:44,686 --> 01:02:46,760
Natre's friends? Come inside.

444
01:02:58,311 --> 01:03:00,880
Have some water. You must be tired.

445
01:03:01,230 --> 01:03:02,887
Did you drive from Bangkok?

446
01:03:04,150 --> 01:03:05,215
Yes.

447
01:03:08,458 --> 01:03:12,652
We'd like to ask about Natre.

448
01:03:13,742 --> 01:03:15,472
She's not feeling well.

449
01:03:15,896 --> 01:03:17,248
She's taking a nap.

450
01:03:18,815 --> 01:03:20,273
Should I wake her?

451
01:03:24,827 --> 01:03:26,487
Stay for dinner.

452
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:28,679
I was about to cook.

453
01:03:28,894 --> 01:03:31,358
I'm making her favourite dish.

454
01:03:33,135 --> 01:03:34,757
Natre will be so happy.

455
01:03:35,289 --> 01:03:37,195
Her friends don't visit often.

456
01:03:37,826 --> 01:03:39,282
Wait right here.

457
01:03:59,027 --> 01:04:00,340
Where are you going?

458
01:05:18,092 --> 01:05:19,443
How dare you?

459
01:05:25,737 --> 01:05:27,788
Did she commit suicide?

460
01:05:32,931 --> 01:05:35,146
We should cremate her.

461
01:05:37,172 --> 01:05:38,179
No.

462
01:05:38,387 --> 01:05:39,809
I won't cremate her.

463
01:05:42,349 --> 01:05:43,380
Ma'am...

464
01:05:45,096 --> 01:05:48,081
I don't know if you believe such things...

465
01:05:48,570 --> 01:05:52,077
but I'd like you to look at these photos.

466
01:05:52,914 --> 01:05:56,387
They were taken around campus.

467
01:05:58,789 --> 01:06:01,217
Some of the places...

468
01:06:02,021 --> 01:06:05,041
were rooms Natre had been in.

469
01:06:05,913 --> 01:06:10,012
And these shadows appeared

470
01:06:13,733 --> 01:06:15,012
I think that...

471
01:06:16,304 --> 01:06:19,527
Natre's spirit is restless.

472
01:06:21,065 --> 01:06:22,344
Natre...

473
01:06:26,141 --> 01:06:27,668
My dear Natre.

474
01:06:29,963 --> 01:06:31,942
Why don't you visit me?

475
01:06:40,771 --> 01:06:43,271
Can you tell me what happened?

476
01:06:44,213 --> 01:06:45,943
Why she left Bangkok?

477
01:06:54,811 --> 01:06:56,126
Ma'am...

478
01:06:58,461 --> 01:06:59,670
Ma'am.

479
01:07:01,103 --> 01:07:02,797
These shadows...

480
01:07:03,396 --> 01:07:06,867
might mean her spirit is not at peace.

481
01:07:11,389 --> 01:07:13,675
We should hold her funeral.

482
01:07:15,282 --> 01:07:16,668
Please.

483
01:07:31,443 --> 01:07:32,722
When she came home...

484
01:07:32,938 --> 01:07:34,431
she seemed different.

485
01:07:34,813 --> 01:07:36,650
She wouldn't talk to anyone.

486
01:07:37,246 --> 01:07:39,320
No one knows what happened in Bangkok.

487
01:07:41,382 --> 01:07:43,634
Then she overdosed on pills.

488
01:07:44,371 --> 01:07:46,871
Luckily, her mother found her...

489
01:07:47,257 --> 01:07:49,199
and got her to the hospital on time.

490
01:07:49,724 --> 01:07:52,081
When she recovered...

491
01:07:53,476 --> 01:07:56,463
she climbed on the hospital roof...

492
01:07:57,126 --> 01:07:58,713
and jumped off the edge.

493
01:08:00,983 --> 01:08:03,862
Why wouldn't her mom cremate her?

494
01:08:06,057 --> 01:08:09,423
She's been distraught
ever since Natre's death.

495
01:08:10,195 --> 01:08:14,010
No matter what she refused to cremate her.

496
01:08:15,407 --> 01:08:17,694
All the villagers were scared.

497
01:08:18,082 --> 01:08:20,997
No one wanted to socialize with her.

498
01:10:28,828 --> 01:10:30,106
Can't sleep?

499
01:10:36,162 --> 01:10:38,305
Tell me the truth...

500
01:10:39,323 --> 01:10:41,054
Did you love Natre?

501
01:10:45,024 --> 01:10:46,823
I tried to...

502
01:10:53,363 --> 01:10:55,958
I believed that one day I would.

503
01:11:01,948 --> 01:11:03,927
But I was fooling myself.

504
01:11:12,270 --> 01:11:13,764
When I broke it off...

505
01:11:15,051 --> 01:11:17,586
I was a total asshole.

506
01:11:23,844 --> 01:11:25,859
But she still loved me the same.

507
01:11:32,706 --> 01:11:34,613
I want this to be over.

508
01:11:36,771 --> 01:11:39,307
If she wants me to die I will.

509
01:11:40,421 --> 01:11:42,152
Don't say that.

510
01:11:43,202 --> 01:11:44,859
It's almost over.

511
01:11:46,296 --> 01:11:47,467
No it's not.

512
01:11:52,863 --> 01:11:55,221
I know she'll come for me.

513
01:11:56,166 --> 01:11:57,268
Tun.

514
01:11:58,215 --> 01:11:59,944
We've come this far.

515
01:12:02,386 --> 01:12:04,435
And you're sorry for what you did.

516
01:12:05,444 --> 01:12:07,068
I'm sure she knows.

517
01:12:09,546 --> 01:12:11,239
Don't talk about death anymore.

518
01:12:18,650 --> 01:12:20,108
I'm sorry.

519
01:12:25,984 --> 01:12:27,819
Do you still love me?

520
01:12:34,011 --> 01:12:36,962
No matter what you won't leave me, right?

521
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,399
Jane.

522
01:15:59,375 --> 01:16:00,725
Tun...

523
01:16:01,112 --> 01:16:02,141
Jane...

524
01:16:02,711 --> 01:16:04,262
Where did you go?

525
01:16:05,631 --> 01:16:07,181
Why did you leave me alone?

526
01:16:08,131 --> 01:16:09,270
We've got to leave.

527
01:16:13,033 --> 01:16:14,489
Asshole!

528
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:17,306
Why did you leave me?

529
01:16:17,515 --> 01:16:19,282
Didn't you love me?

530
01:16:19,740 --> 01:16:21,091
How could you leave me?

531
01:16:24,293 --> 01:16:26,235
How could you leave me?

532
01:18:09,703 --> 01:18:10,945
Tun...

533
01:18:11,336 --> 01:18:12,958
Are you feeling better?

534
01:18:15,610 --> 01:18:17,684
What happened last night?

535
01:18:19,225 --> 01:18:20,327
Tun...

536
01:18:22,074 --> 01:18:23,082
Jane...

537
01:18:23,291 --> 01:18:24,463
Jane...

538
01:18:31,909 --> 01:18:32,881
The abbot said...

539
01:18:33,091 --> 01:18:35,140
Natre will be cremated today.

540
01:18:38,930 --> 01:18:40,552
It's over.

541
01:20:41,265 --> 01:20:42,887
- Hello.
- Hello, Jane.

542
01:20:43,524 --> 01:20:44,591
Picking up photos?

543
01:20:45,435 --> 01:20:46,371
Where's Tun?

544
01:20:46,582 --> 01:20:47,862
He's busy.

545
01:20:48,354 --> 01:20:49,492
Good.

546
01:20:49,710 --> 01:20:50,574
When he's busy...

547
01:20:50,787 --> 01:20:52,314
I get to see you.

548
01:21:00,761 --> 01:21:02,148
You went on vacation?

549
01:21:03,020 --> 01:21:04,122
To the beach.

550
01:21:04,689 --> 01:21:05,862
When did you go?

551
01:21:06,600 --> 01:21:08,188
Last week.

552
01:21:10,632 --> 01:21:12,706
This photo is...

553
01:21:16,367 --> 01:21:17,574
What's wrong?

554
01:21:24,012 --> 01:21:25,292
You look fatter.

555
01:21:27,765 --> 01:21:29,222
I didn't recognize you.

556
01:21:31,832 --> 01:21:32,838
Hi.

557
01:21:33,882 --> 01:21:35,126
Jumbo prints.

558
01:21:36,905 --> 01:21:38,185
Write you name, please.

559
01:24:24,282 --> 01:24:25,596
Get her guys!

560
01:25:02,753 --> 01:25:03,891
Jane...

561
01:25:04,319 --> 01:25:06,119
Why are you crying?

562
01:25:09,149 --> 01:25:10,287
Asshole...

563
01:25:13,007 --> 01:25:15,056
How could you be so cruel?

564
01:25:20,930 --> 01:25:22,422
Where did you find these?

565
01:25:25,136 --> 01:25:26,795
If I didn't find them...

566
01:25:27,012 --> 01:25:29,335
I'd be a fool forever, right?

567
01:25:35,180 --> 01:25:36,733
Let me explain.

568
01:25:40,115 --> 01:25:41,881
What's there to say?

569
01:25:46,405 --> 01:25:48,064
I always believed you.

570
01:25:55,476 --> 01:25:57,490
I thought I knew you.

571
01:26:12,055 --> 01:26:13,157
Tun.

572
01:26:14,452 --> 01:26:15,625
Take her picture...

573
01:26:15,912 --> 01:26:17,154
so she doesn't blab.

574
01:26:17,372 --> 01:26:19,445
Tun, help me.

575
01:26:21,194 --> 01:26:22,403
I know it was wrong.

576
01:26:24,113 --> 01:26:25,985
Take her picture now!

577
01:26:27,207 --> 01:26:28,378
What's wrong!

578
01:26:29,988 --> 01:26:31,515
I'm your buddy!

579
01:26:32,037 --> 01:26:33,104
Hurry!

580
01:26:42,150 --> 01:26:44,057
Tun, help me.

581
01:26:58,069 --> 01:26:59,420
I never forgave myself.

582
01:26:59,632 --> 01:27:01,682
But I was young and stupid.

583
01:27:03,315 --> 01:27:04,738
I've heard enough.

584
01:27:06,931 --> 01:27:08,483
I'm going home.

585
01:28:05,664 --> 01:28:07,051
Come on out!

586
01:28:12,060 --> 01:28:13,481
Where are you?

587
01:28:20,296 --> 01:28:21,992
I thought you loved me!

588
01:28:24,431 --> 01:28:26,198
Loved me so much!

589
01:28:33,989 --> 01:28:36,275
Till death do us part!

590
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,295
She's gone now.

591
01:30:26,697 --> 01:30:27,975
Sometimes...

592
01:30:28,225 --> 01:30:30,654
spirits long for their loved ones.
