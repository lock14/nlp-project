1
00:01:33,943 --> 00:01:35,934
Hey, red coat.

2
00:01:36,412 --> 00:01:38,972
- Yeah, I'm on it.
- God, she's gorgeous.

3
00:01:39,048 --> 00:01:42,108
- What do you think, ballerina?
- No, I think she is a model, brother.

4
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:45,177
- How can you tell?
- Because I can just tell by looking at her.

5
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,753
Hey! You dropped your glove.

6
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,903
Next time you pull
a stunt like that, Casanova...

7
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,210
make sure it's not with a pair of gloves
that I lent you.

8
00:02:13,283 --> 00:02:16,184
I know, I'm sorry. But did you see
the connection we made back there?

9
00:02:16,252 --> 00:02:18,379
I mean, look at me. I'm smitten.

10
00:02:18,822 --> 00:02:20,050
"Smitten"?

11
00:02:20,156 --> 00:02:22,590
You don't look any different.
And who says "smitten" anyway?

12
00:02:22,659 --> 00:02:26,254
No, I know, but I've been here six months
and I meet no one.

13
00:02:26,329 --> 00:02:30,425
And then the day I leave, the prettiest
girl I've ever seen smiles at me.

14
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,900
- I don't even know what her name...
- So don't go to LA.

15
00:02:32,969 --> 00:02:33,958
All right.

16
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,095
- Stay here, look for her.
- I can't. You know that.

17
00:02:36,172 --> 00:02:38,003
This is doing nothing for me musically.

18
00:02:38,074 --> 00:02:42,306
I need to go to California to get heard,
you know that. But come with me.

19
00:02:42,378 --> 00:02:44,710
- You can.
- No, no, no.

20
00:02:45,148 --> 00:02:47,241
I think I need to play
a few street corners first.

21
00:02:47,350 --> 00:02:49,341
See Amsterdam, see Paris.

22
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,687
Besides, I think one sellout
in the family is just plenty.

23
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,052
Eat me.

24
00:02:54,224 --> 00:02:56,351
And on that brotherly note...

25
00:02:56,793 --> 00:02:58,226
take care of yourself, Luke.

26
00:02:58,294 --> 00:03:00,785
You're late. Come on, get out of here.

27
00:03:00,964 --> 00:03:02,397
- Oh, hey.
- Yeah?

28
00:03:04,367 --> 00:03:07,632
This is our last day in New York together.
Watch it. Remember me.

29
00:03:07,704 --> 00:03:08,728
I will.

30
00:03:08,805 --> 00:03:10,636
And, hey, the girl of your dreams is on it.

31
00:03:10,707 --> 00:03:12,265
Be zen, brother.

32
00:03:19,515 --> 00:03:22,848
<i>- Hey, Jenn. It's Brier. Is Carrie in?
- Hold on.</i>

33
00:03:22,986 --> 00:03:24,214
<i>- Thanks.
- It's your niece on two.</i>

34
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:25,720
Hey, Friar Brier.

35
00:03:26,055 --> 00:03:28,546
<i>- Hi.
- Now don't talk with your mouth full.</i>

36
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:30,352
And you're eating crap, aren't you?

37
00:03:30,426 --> 00:03:31,723
Hate to disappoint you, Carrie...

38
00:03:31,794 --> 00:03:36,356
but actually, I'm eating
a very heart-healthy tofu wrap.

39
00:03:36,566 --> 00:03:39,034
Oh, you're a very smart
and a very cute girl...

40
00:03:39,102 --> 00:03:40,501
<i>but you're a terrible liar.</i>

41
00:03:40,803 --> 00:03:44,170
<i>- How did it go with the catalog people?
- Good, good. It was great.</i>

42
00:03:45,108 --> 00:03:46,166
Carrie...

43
00:03:46,242 --> 00:03:49,234
do you believe in destiny
or do you think everything's just random?

44
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,836
Why? What happened?

45
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:54,175
The hottest guy just did the coolest thing.

46
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,444
<i>And?</i>

47
00:03:55,618 --> 00:03:57,415
And I know I'm never going to
see him again.

48
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:59,785
<i>Well, thank God for small miracles.</i>

49
00:04:01,457 --> 00:04:02,515
You okay?

50
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,855
Yeah, I just...

51
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:07,187
I don't know.

52
00:04:07,263 --> 00:04:08,560
It's the first year that...

53
00:04:08,631 --> 00:04:10,826
<i>Mom's not around to talk to me
about this stuff.</i>

54
00:04:11,434 --> 00:04:14,096
I know. I miss her too, kiddo.

55
00:06:34,277 --> 00:06:35,471
<i>We're sorry.</i>

56
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:39,046
<i>Your call cannot...</i>

57
00:06:39,115 --> 00:06:40,548
<i>Try your call again.</i>

58
00:06:46,389 --> 00:06:48,653
<i>- Park Hyatt.
- Hello, can you please connect me...</i>

59
00:06:48,724 --> 00:06:50,316
to Mick Benson's room?

60
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:55,395
<i>Mr. Benson is not a guest at this hotel.
Perhaps you are looking for another name?</i>

61
00:06:55,465 --> 00:06:58,559
No, Rotten. Try Johnny Rotten.

62
00:06:59,202 --> 00:07:02,797
<i>Mr. Rotten. Very handsome man.</i>

63
00:07:02,872 --> 00:07:04,897
<i>- Arigato.
- Connecting you.</i>

64
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,632
$38, $39.

65
00:07:41,144 --> 00:07:42,907
It pays for one of my parking tickets.

66
00:08:02,832 --> 00:08:04,629
Sorry I'm late, baby.

67
00:08:11,774 --> 00:08:13,571
I missed you so much.

68
00:08:15,678 --> 00:08:18,772
You're not upset, are you? Okay.

69
00:08:22,118 --> 00:08:25,747
So when one of my models
wants to go to lunch for a talk...

70
00:08:25,855 --> 00:08:28,915
- it can only be one of the big eight.
- "Big eight"?

71
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:34,419
Drugs, bulimia, anorexia, "I'm broke"...

72
00:08:34,564 --> 00:08:36,930
"I'm pregnant", "I'm gay"...

73
00:08:36,999 --> 00:08:40,366
"I slept with Vince Vaughn
and he never called me again.' '

74
00:08:40,469 --> 00:08:42,596
He never called me either.

75
00:08:43,072 --> 00:08:46,098
- Okay. That's only seven.
- Right.

76
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:50,768
You tell me your thing
and then we'll see if I'm right.

77
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:52,670
Okay.

78
00:08:53,816 --> 00:08:56,341
- I want to move to Los Angeles.
- And?

79
00:08:57,153 --> 00:08:59,280
And I want to try acting.

80
00:09:02,225 --> 00:09:06,628
"Model turned actress. LA.' '

81
00:09:06,696 --> 00:09:07,788
Ouch.

82
00:09:07,863 --> 00:09:09,125
I win.

83
00:09:09,198 --> 00:09:12,065
- How'd you know?
- I'm in the business of knowing things.

84
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:14,432
And look, I understand.

85
00:09:15,204 --> 00:09:19,038
- Now, how's your little rock star?
- Mick and I are fine.

86
00:09:19,108 --> 00:09:20,769
Yeah, you're fine.

87
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:25,677
- So you guys are talking a lot, are you?
- Not a lot, you know. He's on tour, so...

88
00:09:26,882 --> 00:09:30,443
Actually, I think his assistant
has been answering my e-mails.

89
00:09:31,587 --> 00:09:33,578
That's so romantic.

90
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:38,058
I know in my head it's wrong,
but my heart can't let it go.

91
00:09:48,938 --> 00:09:50,929
Dude, that is so rad.

92
00:09:51,007 --> 00:09:55,307
<i>- You got to get that dog on Letterman.
- Actually, we got our eye on the X Games.</i>

93
00:09:55,378 --> 00:09:58,711
<i>Car service will be waiting for you
at the bottom of the escalators.</i>

94
00:09:58,781 --> 00:10:03,343
Use plenty of sun block.
Stay off the 405 whenever possible.

95
00:10:05,087 --> 00:10:09,353
Are you getting any of this?
These are pearls of wisdom here.

96
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:12,588
Yeah, yeah. I'm just a little overwhelmed.

97
00:10:12,762 --> 00:10:15,060
But, I'll be okay.

98
00:10:15,498 --> 00:10:19,059
It's just for a couple of months.
Thank you so much, Carrie.

99
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:23,430
<i>You, you never said there was anything</i>

100
00:10:33,749 --> 00:10:37,207
Hey, why don't you wrap it up?
We've heard enough of this song!

101
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:38,444
Excuse me?

102
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:41,046
I know what I'm talking about.
This is not a good song.

103
00:10:41,123 --> 00:10:42,920
You suck!

104
00:10:42,992 --> 00:10:45,654
Now, ladies and gentlemen, it's okay.
It's okay.

105
00:10:46,429 --> 00:10:49,398
I think I recognize his voice.
Can we get a spot on him?

106
00:10:52,101 --> 00:10:54,035
My little brother tells
me he's a rock star.

107
00:10:54,103 --> 00:10:55,695
Hey, little brother.

108
00:10:56,806 --> 00:11:01,402
- So you've been around the world twice?
- Yeah. Both ways.

109
00:11:01,844 --> 00:11:03,436
And you enjoy this?

110
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,108
Dude, you're kidding me, right?

111
00:11:06,182 --> 00:11:09,618
Going to St. Petersburg next month to play
in the St. Petersburg Folk Festival.

112
00:11:09,685 --> 00:11:11,983
- I'm playing the flute.
- That's cool.

113
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,682
I just have to learn
how to play the flute...

114
00:11:15,491 --> 00:11:17,152
but I have a month to accomplish this.

115
00:11:17,226 --> 00:11:20,059
What about you? Why aren't you playing
the sold-out giganto dome?

116
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:21,460
Didn't you promise me that?

117
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:24,055
Well, you'd be surprised how many people
would kill for this gig.

118
00:11:24,133 --> 00:11:26,829
I'm not surprised. I'm
not surprised at all.

119
00:11:28,637 --> 00:11:30,628
Look, and thanks for letting me
crash at your place.

120
00:11:30,706 --> 00:11:33,174
I mean, two years is way too long.

121
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,837
Let's do one for the old man.

122
00:11:37,513 --> 00:11:39,572
Who wasn't nearly old enough.

123
00:11:41,350 --> 00:11:43,011
Yeah, not even close.

124
00:12:05,374 --> 00:12:08,309
I will be correspondent to command...

125
00:12:08,377 --> 00:12:10,208
and do my spiriting gently.

126
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:14,707
Do so. And after two days,
I will discharge thee.

127
00:12:15,551 --> 00:12:17,178
That's my noble master.

128
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,422
What shall I do? Say what?
What shall I do?

129
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:30,655
Okay, not bad, not bad.
Better than television.

130
00:12:30,966 --> 00:12:32,991
But what isn't? Okay, everybody.

131
00:12:33,068 --> 00:12:36,231
15 minutes. Let's go.
Come on, 15 minutes. Go. Go, go.

132
00:12:38,374 --> 00:12:39,363
Brier.

133
00:12:44,246 --> 00:12:48,307
Actors, I'm not sure you've all been
formally introduced to Brier.

134
00:12:48,484 --> 00:12:50,748
- Brier, actors. Actors, Brier.
- Hi, Brier.

135
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:54,256
I'm Clea.
This is Jason, LeShea, and Michelle.

136
00:12:54,323 --> 00:12:55,415
- Hi.
- Shot in the dark.

137
00:12:55,491 --> 00:12:57,459
You're a New York model, right?

138
00:12:58,727 --> 00:13:01,696
Yeah, I am a model,
but I'm originally from Nebraska.

139
00:13:01,764 --> 00:13:04,528
Don't tell me, ever since you were
a little girl on the farm...

140
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:07,501
it's always been your dream
to become an actress.

141
00:13:08,504 --> 00:13:09,493
Wow.

142
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,369
Dancer, actually, but it didn't work out.

143
00:13:13,442 --> 00:13:15,103
Look, do you have a problem with me?

144
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:18,203
Because as fun as it is being reduced
to a stereotype...

145
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:21,249
I think I'd rather eat that
stack of headshots in your arms...

146
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:24,809
which incidentally look like
they were taken about 10 years ago.

147
00:13:26,322 --> 00:13:28,790
Brier, wait. She didn't mean it.

148
00:13:29,425 --> 00:13:31,450
Please don't tell me that other actors...

149
00:13:31,527 --> 00:13:34,223
are as mean and bitchy to each other
as models.

150
00:13:34,430 --> 00:13:35,761
Welcome to LA.

151
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:39,628
Great.

152
00:13:39,702 --> 00:13:41,135
Forget 15 minutes.

153
00:13:41,203 --> 00:13:43,467
I lied. Come on, back in.

154
00:13:43,606 --> 00:13:46,166
Come on, you can sit with me.
And don't worry.

155
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,676
She'll be a lot nicer after a few drinks.

156
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:49,836
Actors, actors, actors.

157
00:13:56,218 --> 00:13:59,483
- What's up, man?
- What's up, shorty? Watch the shoes.

158
00:13:59,655 --> 00:14:01,122
Sure, sure, dude.

159
00:14:05,027 --> 00:14:09,259
<i>Your little fingers on my spine</i>

160
00:14:13,335 --> 00:14:17,271
<i>And when I open up my eyes</i>

161
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,500
<i>I want to see your face</i>

162
00:14:19,575 --> 00:14:21,941
This guy right here,
he sings from his heart.

163
00:14:22,011 --> 00:14:23,205
I want to throw up.

164
00:14:24,046 --> 00:14:26,514
His work defies classification.

165
00:14:27,016 --> 00:14:28,483
But if I had to take a shot...

166
00:14:28,551 --> 00:14:33,511
I'd say he's like Jeff Buckley
crossed with Elvis Costello.

167
00:14:34,256 --> 00:14:36,884
Yeah, I recognize him.

168
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:40,426
- MTV, right?
- MTV?

169
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:44,466
- Does Luke look like a rapper to you?
- Yeah, you're right.

170
00:14:44,533 --> 00:14:47,366
- He is cool, though.
- Luke has integrity.

171
00:14:47,436 --> 00:14:50,872
He wants to make it, but on his own terms.

172
00:14:54,843 --> 00:14:57,937
So, have you gone out?

173
00:14:58,013 --> 00:15:00,413
That's kind of complicated.

174
00:15:00,816 --> 00:15:02,647
He's like a brother to me.

175
00:15:16,498 --> 00:15:19,331
<i>Why don't you play Smart in a Stupid Way?</i>

176
00:15:19,735 --> 00:15:23,193
<i>All right, Smart in a Stupid Way it is,
but I need a little help.</i>

177
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:25,299
Get Clea up onstage. Get her up there.

178
00:15:25,374 --> 00:15:28,571
<i>Is the sexiest singer in LA
in the house tonight?</i>

179
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:48,362
<i>She had eyes like crazy diamonds</i>

180
00:15:49,064 --> 00:15:52,966
<i>And you ran with feet of clay</i>

181
00:15:55,971 --> 00:15:59,566
<i>They rolled the windows
tight as they would go</i>

182
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:02,770
<i>It was a smoggy day</i>

183
00:16:06,749 --> 00:16:09,183
<i>She looked up and asked me</i>

184
00:16:09,251 --> 00:16:11,845
<i>If I ever had a lover</i>

185
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:13,649
<i>That I did not betray</i>

186
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:16,088
<i>Did not betray</i>

187
00:16:17,192 --> 00:16:19,717
<i>And I turned on the radio</i>

188
00:16:19,795 --> 00:16:20,887
<i>The radio</i>

189
00:16:20,963 --> 00:16:24,956
<i>And I looked the other way</i>

190
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:31,605
<i>She said, "You're smart,
but in a stupid way"</i>

191
00:16:36,045 --> 00:16:39,708
<i>And this is this is the price that he pays</i>

192
00:16:40,816 --> 00:16:44,980
<i>For being smart in a stupid way</i>

193
00:16:46,188 --> 00:16:50,284
<i>You stand there staring
while your lover walks away</i>

194
00:16:50,993 --> 00:16:52,824
- She's tight, man.
- Look. Hey.

195
00:16:53,062 --> 00:16:55,860
Screw him. Look, we're talking
about our boys here, the Rounders.

196
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,990
- Grounded.
- Grounded. Now look.

197
00:16:58,067 --> 00:17:00,262
We're gonna do four songs. No encores.

198
00:17:00,369 --> 00:17:02,564
You're gonna leave them wanting more.
In order:

199
00:17:02,638 --> 00:17:05,004
<i>- Up to Me, Internal Spike.
- Strike.</i>

200
00:17:05,074 --> 00:17:07,372
<i>- Internal Strike, Car Ride.
- You got it.</i>

201
00:17:07,443 --> 00:17:10,378
- Which version?
- The short one. What's wrong with you?

202
00:17:11,847 --> 00:17:16,147
<i>The train just pulled away</i>

203
00:17:18,821 --> 00:17:22,052
<i>Sometimes I smell the perfume</i>

204
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:25,360
Any of you guys know the name
of that chick over there?

205
00:17:25,427 --> 00:17:26,416
No.

206
00:17:27,563 --> 00:17:30,361
- Is that your friend?
- I don't think so.

207
00:17:30,432 --> 00:17:34,163
He's just another record company jackass.
I think his name's Garrett Schweck.

208
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:36,267
- Pretend he's not here.
- Okay.

209
00:17:40,342 --> 00:17:43,175
<i>Maybe I'll grow up</i>

210
00:17:43,712 --> 00:17:47,705
<i>And be good someday</i>

211
00:17:50,385 --> 00:17:54,651
<i>Maybe this pain I feel will go away</i>

212
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:03,590
<i>And this is the price that you pay</i>

213
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:07,829
<i>For being smart in a stupid way</i>

214
00:18:08,937 --> 00:18:13,306
<i>You stand there staring
while your lover walks away</i>

215
00:18:13,375 --> 00:18:15,275
<i>Being smart</i>

216
00:18:17,446 --> 00:18:21,473
<i>In a stupid way</i>

217
00:18:33,162 --> 00:18:36,563
<i>Thank you. Thank you.
I'm going to take a break.</i>

218
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:38,857
<i>I do have an announcement.</i>

219
00:18:39,401 --> 00:18:42,996
<i>I misplaced a pair of gloves a while back,
if anybody's seen them.</i>

220
00:18:47,142 --> 00:18:50,600
- Oh, my God, you were fantastic.
- Thank you.

221
00:18:52,014 --> 00:18:54,244
My old office. I'm no longer there.

222
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,252
I recognized you.

223
00:19:01,156 --> 00:19:03,021
You figured it out.

224
00:19:03,091 --> 00:19:06,219
Yeah. I thought for a second
that you were my third grade boyfriend.

225
00:19:06,328 --> 00:19:08,956
- So you're disappointed?
- No.

226
00:19:10,332 --> 00:19:12,425
I'm a Taurus. He was a bed-wetter.

227
00:19:12,501 --> 00:19:14,298
It would never have worked out.

228
00:19:14,369 --> 00:19:18,772
But you look different,
like manly and like...

229
00:19:19,374 --> 00:19:22,707
- bigger and more manlier.
- Brier, you're babbling.

230
00:19:22,778 --> 00:19:24,075
More grown-up.

231
00:19:24,146 --> 00:19:26,512
- I'm Luke.
- Brier.

232
00:19:28,684 --> 00:19:29,878
Sit.

233
00:19:31,486 --> 00:19:32,885
This is my brother Euan.

234
00:19:32,955 --> 00:19:36,789
His views do not reflect my own
or my family's in any way.

235
00:19:36,859 --> 00:19:39,521
I'm just going to throw it out
right on the table, right now.

236
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,789
Naked folk singing.

237
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:45,464
- But I didn't hear a no.
- Okay, kids. Next stop, L.A. Burger.

238
00:19:45,534 --> 00:19:47,729
You grab your brother, we're out of here.

239
00:19:59,414 --> 00:20:02,315
Wait. So you just threw your glove at her?

240
00:20:02,384 --> 00:20:06,582
No. No, no. It was way more
romantic than that. Sweet.

241
00:20:06,688 --> 00:20:09,213
I must have looked for you on that train
for over a year.

242
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,054
And now here he is.

243
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,892
So, what's up with the music career,
rock star? The new tracks are hot.

244
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,227
Yeah, you sounded really good tonight.

245
00:20:17,299 --> 00:20:20,564
Thanks. Same crap, different day.

246
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,763
No, all the A&R guys are like Garrett.

247
00:20:22,838 --> 00:20:25,534
They're interested at first but...

248
00:20:25,707 --> 00:20:29,199
you know, then it's, like,
"Well, why didn't anyone else sign him?"

249
00:20:29,344 --> 00:20:31,335
It must be really hard.

250
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:33,804
Well, some days, but...

251
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:35,572
Hey...

252
00:20:35,884 --> 00:20:39,012
you get to play live for people.
I'd do it for free.

253
00:20:39,087 --> 00:20:42,056
- You pretty much do, brother.
- Yeah, good point.

254
00:20:42,124 --> 00:20:43,614
Yeah, good point.

255
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:47,717
- Look at the time.
- I've got to go. I got a callback tomorrow.

256
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:50,658
- Showoff.
- Yeah, for a deodorant commercial.

257
00:20:50,732 --> 00:20:53,166
- It's going to make me a star.
- Yes.

258
00:20:54,269 --> 00:20:58,069
Bye. It's nice meeting you. Again, right?

259
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,037
- Bye.
- Yeah, bye.

260
00:21:01,243 --> 00:21:03,268
- Well?
- What?

261
00:21:03,612 --> 00:21:07,013
You're letting her get away, jackass. Go.
Go get her. Go.

262
00:21:09,384 --> 00:21:12,251
- Brier?
- Hi.

263
00:21:13,355 --> 00:21:16,153
I never got the chance to...

264
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,723
I had a question.

265
00:21:20,796 --> 00:21:22,821
Can I call you sometime?

266
00:21:29,304 --> 00:21:31,534
Can I take that grunt as a yes?

267
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:35,134
You're really sweet.

268
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:38,104
"Sweet" as in sweet, or "sweet" as in...

269
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:40,774
a busboy giving you a hug
on your birthday?

270
00:21:40,849 --> 00:21:42,043
What?

271
00:21:42,751 --> 00:21:45,185
Sorry, that made sense in my head.

272
00:21:46,021 --> 00:21:50,014
No, you're really nice
and you're really talented and...

273
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,860
handsome. I just...

274
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:55,253
- There's just...
- But, you have a boyfriend.

275
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,729
Kind of.

276
00:21:57,499 --> 00:21:59,433
- "Kind of"?
- Yes.

277
00:21:59,701 --> 00:22:01,635
Why do you say "kind of"?

278
00:22:02,971 --> 00:22:06,463
It's a little mixed up right now...

279
00:22:06,541 --> 00:22:09,704
and I promised myself
as well as my best friend that...

280
00:22:09,778 --> 00:22:13,077
I wouldn't get involved
with another musician, so...

281
00:22:13,582 --> 00:22:15,641
Understand, all right?

282
00:22:16,685 --> 00:22:17,879
No.

283
00:22:19,821 --> 00:22:21,516
I'm sorry.

284
00:22:21,623 --> 00:22:25,684
Hey. Brier, I'm so glad I caught you.

285
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,259
I'm about four mojitos over the limit.

286
00:22:28,463 --> 00:22:30,226
- Can I grab a ride?
- Yeah, sure.

287
00:22:30,298 --> 00:22:33,233
- Thank you, Brier.
- See you later, okay?

288
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:35,433
All right.

289
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:44,478
- Dude, are you doing it again?
- What?

290
00:22:44,546 --> 00:22:46,673
Just watching her go away?

291
00:22:50,385 --> 00:22:52,819
- Want to talk about it?
- Talk about what?

292
00:22:53,288 --> 00:22:54,812
Why you're being an idiot.

293
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:57,991
This perfectly amazing, talented...

294
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:00,585
beautiful guy reappears magically
in your life...

295
00:23:00,662 --> 00:23:02,493
Yeah, and I have a boyfriend.

296
00:23:02,564 --> 00:23:04,964
You mean the 40-year-old rock star
who cheats on you...

297
00:23:05,033 --> 00:23:06,830
and hasn't called you in a month?

298
00:23:07,869 --> 00:23:10,064
Break me off a piece of that.

299
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,569
I don't know how to get over him.

300
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:16,875
I don't think you fall out of love
until you fall into someone else.

301
00:23:17,546 --> 00:23:19,776
Trading one musician for another?

302
00:23:19,881 --> 00:23:23,146
Plus, even if he doesn't make it,
Luke's still going to be miserable.

303
00:23:23,218 --> 00:23:25,846
And when he becomes successful
and goes on tour...

304
00:23:25,921 --> 00:23:28,219
- you'll lose him to the road.
- Yeah, exactly.

305
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:30,781
Look, Luke's amazing, but...

306
00:23:31,393 --> 00:23:34,362
But what?
You don't think he's gonna make it?

307
00:23:35,163 --> 00:23:38,758
I asked him once why he kept at it.
He just laughed.

308
00:23:39,134 --> 00:23:42,797
He said it was the only way he could
thank his dad for the piano lessons.

309
00:23:42,871 --> 00:23:45,032
- That's such a line.
- I know.

310
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:48,609
Funny thing, though. He meant it.

311
00:23:48,677 --> 00:23:52,909
Listen, if I had the cash,
I would pay for his record myself.

312
00:23:53,348 --> 00:23:55,782
Wait. Why don't we do something for him?

313
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,649
What? Like become his first two groupies?

314
00:23:58,787 --> 00:24:02,154
Because I would be totally,
totally down with that.

315
00:24:02,224 --> 00:24:04,283
No, no, no. I'm talking about...

316
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:07,192
We could create a total buzz about him.

317
00:24:07,262 --> 00:24:09,526
You know how that Garrett guy
totally worked the room?

318
00:24:09,598 --> 00:24:10,963
We could do that, easy.

319
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:13,262
- He is talented.
- Yeah, he's talented.

320
00:24:13,335 --> 00:24:16,304
We could totally do it.
We could get the internet, images, buzz.

321
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:18,134
Don't you think that's a little bit sneaky?

322
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:21,505
Yeah, it's sneaky,
but it's totally for a good cause.

323
00:24:22,077 --> 00:24:23,476
I'm not going to lie to you, kiddo.

324
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:27,140
Your plan's blatantly manipulative
and sneaky...

325
00:24:27,215 --> 00:24:29,683
not to mention ethically questionable.

326
00:24:30,452 --> 00:24:32,113
I am so in.

327
00:24:32,521 --> 00:24:35,490
The thing is, the guy deserves it.
I mean, he's a really good guy.

328
00:24:35,557 --> 00:24:37,582
Does this mean we're getting rid of the...

329
00:24:37,659 --> 00:24:39,957
<i>womanizing, grunge-era relic?</i>

330
00:24:40,028 --> 00:24:42,053
Sorry, Carrie. Luke's just a friend.

331
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:43,324
So you have a girl or not?

332
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:45,889
<i>Jenn, who do we have
working on the coast?</i>

333
00:24:46,334 --> 00:24:48,131
Hold on. Here it is.

334
00:24:49,771 --> 00:24:52,433
A really beautiful,
all natural Brazilian...

335
00:24:53,008 --> 00:24:55,374
or maybe not so natural.

336
00:24:55,577 --> 00:24:57,875
Josie, thank you so much.

337
00:24:58,046 --> 00:25:00,606
No problem. I like musicians.

338
00:25:01,149 --> 00:25:03,049
- So, is he cute?
- Let's get this clear.

339
00:25:03,118 --> 00:25:05,780
He doesn't look like
one of the Calvin Klein men.

340
00:25:05,854 --> 00:25:08,288
- They're not men, they're boys.
- What does that mean?

341
00:25:08,356 --> 00:25:09,755
I think it's a language thing.

342
00:25:09,824 --> 00:25:12,793
But why don't we get going
because I think we're going to be late.

343
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:15,386
- How long have you been here?
- I arrived an hour ago, about.

344
00:25:15,463 --> 00:25:17,454
No. I mean, in this country.

345
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:21,664
- Which country?
- A language thing?

346
00:25:22,003 --> 00:25:25,370
- What's Brazilian for "moron"?
- Let's just be nice.

347
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,873
Okay.

348
00:25:27,943 --> 00:25:32,778
<i>Baby, I can see it even with the light out</i>

349
00:25:34,716 --> 00:25:39,551
<i>Baby, I can see it even with the light out</i>

350
00:25:45,527 --> 00:25:48,087
- You're fabulous.
- Thanks, do I know you?

351
00:25:48,163 --> 00:25:49,926
Perhaps you saw a commercial.

352
00:25:49,998 --> 00:25:53,695
ColorSoft shampoo.
"Hair, like I made it, but way better.' '

353
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:56,566
- Sorry, doesn't ring a bell.
- No matter, sexy guy.

354
00:25:56,905 --> 00:26:00,136
Here you go. Will you take a picture
for me and my family in Brazil?

355
00:26:00,208 --> 00:26:01,232
Sure, sure.

356
00:26:13,255 --> 00:26:14,950
You got him, Richard.

357
00:26:15,590 --> 00:26:18,354
And since I'm giving Page 6
this exclusive...

358
00:26:18,426 --> 00:26:20,485
this layout better be splashy.

359
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:01,229
<i>You were good</i>

360
00:27:01,303 --> 00:27:02,736
<i>Oh, you see</i>

361
00:27:03,972 --> 00:27:07,305
<i>Come with me</i>

362
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,935
Try and understand.
I have friends blogging the world.

363
00:27:10,011 --> 00:27:12,138
You should see the websites popping up.

364
00:27:12,213 --> 00:27:14,443
Luke even has his own chat room.

365
00:27:14,516 --> 00:27:16,950
Every little bit helps.

366
00:27:17,752 --> 00:27:19,276
Who's that one over there?

367
00:27:19,854 --> 00:27:21,947
Holy cow!

368
00:27:22,824 --> 00:27:24,689
This might be working.

369
00:27:28,697 --> 00:27:32,098
- Who'd you get, actresses?
- Not reliable enough.

370
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:36,100
- Strippers.
- Did you just say "Holy cow"?

371
00:27:37,839 --> 00:27:40,865
- You can take the girl off the farm...
- Oh, shut up.

372
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,974
Hey, hey. There's Garrett. Go get him.

373
00:27:45,113 --> 00:27:46,637
Cool deal.

374
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,745
Jason, you're on.

375
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:54,311
<i>That's not me</i>

376
00:27:54,556 --> 00:27:57,889
<i>I am strong and so are you</i>

377
00:27:58,293 --> 00:28:01,456
<i>Don't know what to do</i>

378
00:28:01,796 --> 00:28:05,596
<i>You're a pure example</i>

379
00:28:06,034 --> 00:28:08,559
<i>Just a pure example</i>

380
00:28:08,636 --> 00:28:10,297
Looks like your boy's got his mojo back.

381
00:28:10,372 --> 00:28:12,499
You should have signed him
when you had the chance.

382
00:28:12,574 --> 00:28:14,940
And who says I still can't?

383
00:28:15,009 --> 00:28:17,910
I don't know.
Maybe my friend here from Elektra Records.

384
00:28:18,146 --> 00:28:19,807
Elektra?

385
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:20,937
Wow.

386
00:28:21,082 --> 00:28:24,381
I know a bunch of cats down at your label,
but I don't believe we've met.

387
00:28:24,486 --> 00:28:27,250
- Garrett Schweck, Tantra.
- Don't know it.

388
00:28:27,555 --> 00:28:30,456
Bond. Jason Bond. A&R, London.

389
00:28:30,759 --> 00:28:34,354
Well, Bond, you're a long way from home,
aren't you?

390
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:39,297
Then I damn well better not go home
empty-handed, had I?

391
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:42,302
Why don't I give you something
to bring back home with you?

392
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,861
- That could be arranged.
- Come with me, Mr. Bond.

393
00:28:44,939 --> 00:28:48,033
I would love for you to charm me
with your dirty English banter.

394
00:28:49,344 --> 00:28:51,244
- Cheers.
- Cheerio, Bond.

395
00:28:51,746 --> 00:28:54,476
- Kick some British ass.
- Indeed, sir.

396
00:28:54,549 --> 00:28:57,245
- Hold me back.
- Nice touch on the accent.

397
00:28:58,186 --> 00:29:00,051
Improv, Daddy-O!

398
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:04,686
<i>The fire in your eyes</i>

399
00:29:05,293 --> 00:29:07,056
<i>Can I have your number?</i>

400
00:29:07,128 --> 00:29:08,755
<i>Should a single summer</i>

401
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:12,357
<i>Put fire in your eyes</i>

402
00:29:14,135 --> 00:29:18,333
<i>What would you say if I offer you</i>

403
00:29:18,406 --> 00:29:20,203
<i>a safer place?</i>

404
00:29:20,275 --> 00:29:24,006
<i>You're a pure example</i>

405
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:31,908
- He's really not that bad, this kid.
- He's awesome.

406
00:29:33,955 --> 00:29:35,684
So, I can...

407
00:29:35,757 --> 00:29:38,225
barely get a seat
at one of your shows anymore.

408
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,853
I know it's crazy. It just...

409
00:29:41,296 --> 00:29:43,127
I don't know what I'm doing differently.

410
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:45,029
I guess it's just a timing thing.

411
00:29:45,099 --> 00:29:48,899
- You know, right songs, right crowd.
- Yeah, that must be it.

412
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:52,462
Oh, by the way, the guy
from Tantra's coming back next week.

413
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,768
- Great.
- Yeah, it could be.

414
00:29:53,842 --> 00:29:56,140
He said he's trying
to make an artist-friendly label...

415
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:59,044
- kind of like Pink Sands used to be.
- What's Pink Sands?

416
00:29:59,681 --> 00:30:02,309
It's just this old, cool label.

417
00:30:02,784 --> 00:30:05,582
It was started by this guy
named Wick Treadway.

418
00:30:05,753 --> 00:30:07,152
Where is he now?

419
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:13,485
Apparently, it's break time.

420
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:15,996
- You want to sit?
- Sure.

421
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,721
Come on, pup.

422
00:30:19,868 --> 00:30:20,960
Yeah.

423
00:30:21,035 --> 00:30:24,527
So last I heard, he was starting some
eco-resort in the Caribbean or something.

424
00:30:24,606 --> 00:30:26,267
- Cool.
- Yeah.

425
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:29,308
So, are you coming Monday night?

426
00:30:29,744 --> 00:30:32,076
- Depends.
- On what?

427
00:30:32,313 --> 00:30:34,474
If Clea and I are on the list.

428
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,175
Clea and you.

429
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:41,379
You know, I've been meaning to ask you
about that. Are you guys...

430
00:30:44,158 --> 00:30:45,750
You know...

431
00:30:47,128 --> 00:30:48,152
What?

432
00:30:48,229 --> 00:30:51,562
Of course. Because I
don't want to date you, I'm gay, right?

433
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:53,225
- No, that's not what I...
- I see.

434
00:30:53,301 --> 00:30:55,735
Yeah. It occurred to me.

435
00:30:57,238 --> 00:30:59,900
You're getting used to every girl
throwing themselves at you.

436
00:30:59,974 --> 00:31:03,535
- Not every girl's gonna be like that.
- I know. It's just...

437
00:31:06,214 --> 00:31:09,012
When are we going to break out
of the friend zone?

438
00:31:09,484 --> 00:31:12,248
- I'm involved.
- I know you say that, but...

439
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,813
why haven't I seen him? Why haven't you?

440
00:31:15,957 --> 00:31:18,949
Why don't you ever talk about him?
It doesn't make any sense.

441
00:31:19,027 --> 00:31:20,494
Because...

442
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,857
I don't know why.

443
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:29,698
<i>Thank you.</i>

444
00:31:31,539 --> 00:31:33,803
- Will you sign this?
- Sure.

445
00:31:36,778 --> 00:31:40,009
Nice touch.
I wish I would have thought of it.

446
00:31:48,056 --> 00:31:51,423
- Can I buy a round of drinks for the table?
- Which one?

447
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,149
What the hell. All of them.

448
00:31:53,227 --> 00:31:55,218
How about just my six up front,
Daddy Warbucks?

449
00:31:55,296 --> 00:31:57,287
- All right, you got it.
- Thank you.

450
00:31:59,133 --> 00:32:00,794
Hi, sexy guy.

451
00:32:08,776 --> 00:32:10,300
Josie.

452
00:32:13,114 --> 00:32:15,207
Long time no see, boo.

453
00:32:21,389 --> 00:32:23,857
- Did he just call her "boo"?
- Yeah.

454
00:32:24,092 --> 00:32:26,356
Who does he think he is, Ludacris?

455
00:32:28,329 --> 00:32:30,627
Come on, sweetheart. Don't be silly.

456
00:32:30,999 --> 00:32:32,933
You and I both know that she's in LA.

457
00:32:33,101 --> 00:32:35,968
<i>- I'm just going to invite her to my show.
- That's great, Mick.</i>

458
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:38,232
<i>But I'm the middle of
a triple witching hour...</i>

459
00:32:38,306 --> 00:32:40,365
<i>and I'm not giving you her number...</i>

460
00:32:40,441 --> 00:32:43,433
nor am I going to confirm
whether or not she's in LA.

461
00:32:43,845 --> 00:32:46,473
<i>Nice try, though, love.</i>

462
00:32:48,983 --> 00:32:50,473
Talentless ass.

463
00:32:50,551 --> 00:32:51,609
What was that?

464
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:55,246
- Sorry, I thought I hung up.
- No, you didn't.

465
00:32:55,323 --> 00:32:56,312
<i>Damn it.</i>

466
00:32:58,259 --> 00:32:59,317
Hello?

467
00:32:59,827 --> 00:33:00,885
Hello?

468
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:06,157
Well, that got rid of
you. Chauvinist creep.

469
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:08,062
No, you didn't, baby.

470
00:33:12,774 --> 00:33:14,241
There you go.

471
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,473
You sure left in a hurry the other night.

472
00:33:17,545 --> 00:33:19,775
Yeah, I thought I was coming down
with something.

473
00:33:19,847 --> 00:33:21,314
Brazilian flu?

474
00:33:22,984 --> 00:33:25,214
- Not funny.
- Kind of funny.

475
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,415
Why don't you just admit that you like him?

476
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:30,150
Why would I do something like that?

477
00:33:30,224 --> 00:33:35,184
Because it's true. I mean, come on. It's
not like the guy's not interested in you.

478
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:37,454
It's complicated.

479
00:33:40,401 --> 00:33:42,028
<i>- Good job.
- Et tu, Brute.</i>

480
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,230
- Does that mean it's my turn?
- Oh, yes.

481
00:33:44,739 --> 00:33:46,263
Watch out here.

482
00:33:52,847 --> 00:33:55,611
You know, it's okay to admit
if you're scared.

483
00:33:55,817 --> 00:33:58,251
Excuse me? I'm not scared.

484
00:33:58,986 --> 00:34:00,283
Anyways, how would you know?

485
00:34:00,354 --> 00:34:03,585
Obviously, you've never had
your heart broken before.

486
00:34:04,225 --> 00:34:05,214
Swing.

487
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:08,151
Brier, just be honest with yourself.

488
00:34:08,563 --> 00:34:09,860
You are scared.

489
00:34:10,665 --> 00:34:14,431
- And you're totally hiding behind Mick.
- Mick's my boyfriend.

490
00:34:14,936 --> 00:34:18,201
Yeah, kind of like the boyfriend
I told Harley Sasser about.

491
00:34:18,539 --> 00:34:20,097
Who's Harley Sasser?

492
00:34:20,174 --> 00:34:22,404
He was my boyfriend at camp
when I was 14.

493
00:34:23,211 --> 00:34:25,805
He was so hot, every Thursday night...

494
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,440
we'd sneak out and make out
behind the craft shop.

495
00:34:28,583 --> 00:34:31,984
The problem was, as summer went on,
he started wanting more.

496
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,118
- More?
- You know, more.

497
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:36,586
Oh.

498
00:34:37,258 --> 00:34:41,024
Anyway, one week I decided I was sick
of the groping.

499
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:45,933
So, I confessed to Harley that I had a
boyfriend back in LA named Tony Savatsky.

500
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:49,094
I told him I felt really guilty
and that was the end of Harley and I.

501
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,330
Okay, I get it.

502
00:34:50,438 --> 00:34:53,737
You made up the other guy so you didn't
have to get felt up anymore.

503
00:34:53,808 --> 00:34:54,797
Oh, no.

504
00:34:55,943 --> 00:35:00,243
Tony Savatsky was real. He just
hadn't been my boyfriend in eight months.

505
00:35:04,385 --> 00:35:08,185
Not to rush you, Luke, but could you just
sign the damn contract?

506
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:10,883
How is that not rushing me?

507
00:35:11,159 --> 00:35:12,990
You're right. I'm sorry.

508
00:35:14,162 --> 00:35:17,063
Look, I wouldn't be on edge like this...

509
00:35:17,198 --> 00:35:22,135
if I and everyone else at Tantra didn't
have such a gigantic hard-on for you, kid.

510
00:35:22,236 --> 00:35:24,636
And I don't get hard for just anyone.

511
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:27,037
- Thanks.
- Tantra is where you belong.

512
00:35:27,108 --> 00:35:30,134
It's where you'll get rich.
It's where you'll be heard.

513
00:35:30,678 --> 00:35:32,145
Look. Check this out.

514
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:36,541
This guy, last year, he was living
in the streets, a meth addict.

515
00:35:36,851 --> 00:35:39,445
She was teaching gym in South Central.

516
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:42,921
These jackasses were playing proms
in Pacoima.

517
00:35:43,357 --> 00:35:45,257
You know what they all have in common?

518
00:35:45,793 --> 00:35:47,158
- What?
- Me.

519
00:35:47,495 --> 00:35:51,522
I broke them. Every last one of them.
And I'm going to do the same for you.

520
00:35:51,999 --> 00:35:53,364
Where is Pacoima?

521
00:35:53,668 --> 00:35:57,069
You can dick around with
your major labels all you want, Luke...

522
00:35:57,138 --> 00:35:58,400
but you got to trust me.

523
00:35:58,472 --> 00:36:02,408
- The key is to strike when the iron is hot.
- He's right, baby.

524
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:03,936
Think about it.

525
00:36:06,380 --> 00:36:07,779
Help me here, Josie.

526
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:10,374
- Hello.
- Hey. Brier, come in.

527
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,781
- Hi.
- I didn't know you had people here.

528
00:36:14,021 --> 00:36:18,651
They were discussing business
and Garrett has a little problem.

529
00:36:20,862 --> 00:36:23,456
- Clearly this is a weird time.
- Not at all.

530
00:36:23,531 --> 00:36:26,523
I'm just trying to give the guy
a bag full of money.

531
00:36:28,236 --> 00:36:30,761
Forget them. Coming to the show tonight?

532
00:36:30,905 --> 00:36:33,635
I'm not sure but I'm
definitely going to try.

533
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:34,763
Please?

534
00:36:35,443 --> 00:36:36,637
Okay.

535
00:36:36,711 --> 00:36:38,144
All right, take care.

536
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:39,712
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.

537
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:41,070
So long.

538
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:43,641
Luke?

539
00:36:43,718 --> 00:36:45,015
Luke.

540
00:36:45,286 --> 00:36:46,583
Let's hop to it.

541
00:36:46,654 --> 00:36:48,178
That's great.

542
00:36:48,356 --> 00:36:49,789
More to your left.

543
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:51,758
Perfect.

544
00:36:58,266 --> 00:37:00,791
I called her and I was like,
"Yeah, he's been out.' '

545
00:37:10,411 --> 00:37:12,879
You don't understand. It's not gonna work.

546
00:37:21,022 --> 00:37:23,957
- Sir, this is a closed set.
- I'm a good friend of Brier's.

547
00:37:24,025 --> 00:37:26,289
Oh, sure you are, yeah. Got to go.

548
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:28,794
If you'd just let me by,
that'd be excellent. Thank you.

549
00:37:28,863 --> 00:37:30,353
- Security.
- Hi.

550
00:37:31,465 --> 00:37:32,955
Luke, what are you doing here?

551
00:37:33,034 --> 00:37:36,731
I just wanted you to be the first
to know that I did it.

552
00:37:36,804 --> 00:37:37,793
What?

553
00:37:37,872 --> 00:37:39,863
I signed a contract. I'm with Tantra.

554
00:37:40,441 --> 00:37:41,601
Oh.

555
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:43,473
I know, I'm still in shock.

556
00:37:44,045 --> 00:37:46,980
God, I've been doing it for so long.
It just happened so fast.

557
00:37:47,048 --> 00:37:49,608
That's really great.
Can you give us two minutes?

558
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:51,149
Sure, no problem.

559
00:37:51,218 --> 00:37:52,651
Anyway...

560
00:37:53,988 --> 00:37:55,853
I just wanted to thank you.

561
00:37:56,657 --> 00:37:59,922
We both know how big a part
you played in all this.

562
00:38:00,061 --> 00:38:02,461
- Me?
- Yes.

563
00:38:02,563 --> 00:38:07,057
You've been so supportive
and such a good friend and you inspire me.

564
00:38:08,769 --> 00:38:09,895
I do?

565
00:38:17,078 --> 00:38:18,443
There you go.

566
00:38:22,416 --> 00:38:24,407
- You know what?
- What?

567
00:38:25,419 --> 00:38:27,046
- We should celebrate.
- We should.

568
00:38:27,121 --> 00:38:29,021
Yes, yes. We should go celebrate at this...

569
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,684
really celebratory place
that I think you would really like.

570
00:38:31,759 --> 00:38:33,954
- I mean, I love it.
- Okay.

571
00:38:34,028 --> 00:38:38,328
We have, like, 10 more minutes,
one more shot, and then we can meet.

572
00:38:38,432 --> 00:38:40,525
- She'll show you where to sit, okay?
- Perfect.

573
00:38:42,203 --> 00:38:43,192
Hi.

574
00:38:43,904 --> 00:38:46,873
What would you have said
if you had seen me again?

575
00:38:48,175 --> 00:38:51,702
I would have said that you were
the most beautiful girl in the world.

576
00:38:51,779 --> 00:38:52,768
You?

577
00:38:53,781 --> 00:38:58,309
I would have said probably the same thing
I would have said today, but then.

578
00:39:00,388 --> 00:39:03,152
- Which is?
- "Why don't you have a girlfriend?"

579
00:39:05,359 --> 00:39:06,383
Yeah.

580
00:39:06,460 --> 00:39:10,089
Well, I'm pretty much
a skeptical serial monogamist.

581
00:39:11,298 --> 00:39:12,788
Why is that?

582
00:39:14,802 --> 00:39:17,999
When I figured out that the closer I got
to making it...

583
00:39:18,072 --> 00:39:20,939
the more women seemed to materialize
out of the vapor.

584
00:39:21,008 --> 00:39:22,532
And when the deals disappeared...

585
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:24,077
so did they, so...

586
00:39:24,145 --> 00:39:26,238
We're not all like that.

587
00:39:27,648 --> 00:39:31,948
You know, I've been in LA for two years
and I didn't know there was a subway.

588
00:39:33,554 --> 00:39:35,385
We need a longer cable.

589
00:39:35,489 --> 00:39:39,789
- I was kind of picturing a bar or something.
- A bar?

590
00:39:40,327 --> 00:39:43,888
You play in a bar every night.
That's boring. This is special.

591
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:46,159
Yeah, yeah. Not in this lifetime.

592
00:39:46,233 --> 00:39:48,030
What's the big deal? There's a net.

593
00:39:48,102 --> 00:39:50,070
- Yeah, right.
- Right, you watching?

594
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:51,798
- Yep.
- Here goes.

595
00:40:15,896 --> 00:40:17,420
Come on, give it a try.

596
00:40:17,531 --> 00:40:19,260
Yeah, sorry.

597
00:40:19,867 --> 00:40:22,597
My record contract has a "no dying" clause.

598
00:40:23,804 --> 00:40:25,567
Are you being a wuss?

599
00:41:10,184 --> 00:41:11,344
Yay.

600
00:41:17,491 --> 00:41:18,753
You okay?

601
00:41:20,594 --> 00:41:22,721
- You want help up?
- Yeah. Thank you.

602
00:41:22,796 --> 00:41:24,388
Okay. Come here.

603
00:41:25,666 --> 00:41:27,065
You okay?

604
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,226
This place sucks.

605
00:42:01,001 --> 00:42:02,798
I have something for you.

606
00:42:07,775 --> 00:42:09,504
This is from the other night.

607
00:42:10,544 --> 00:42:12,842
It's kind of a rough mix, but...

608
00:42:13,247 --> 00:42:15,147
My God, thank you.

609
00:42:17,885 --> 00:42:21,480
Everything's happened
since you showed up, Brier...

610
00:42:22,389 --> 00:42:24,323
and everything's happening...

611
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:29,260
And I want you to be my girlfriend.

612
00:42:31,165 --> 00:42:34,726
Come on the road with me.
We'll see the country together.

613
00:42:38,606 --> 00:42:40,471
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.

614
00:42:44,845 --> 00:42:46,005
I'm sorry.

615
00:42:47,147 --> 00:42:49,672
<i>- What's up, party girl?
- Turn on the radio.</i>

616
00:42:50,017 --> 00:42:52,542
<i>- Howard Stern.
- You know I don't listen to him.</i>

617
00:42:53,254 --> 00:42:55,654
<i>Crap, it's ending.
It's that fake Brazilian chick.</i>

618
00:42:55,723 --> 00:42:59,318
<i>She's going on and on about Luke.
You'd think that they were an item.</i>

619
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:02,486
<i>- She wouldn't shut up.
- I'm sorry I missed that.</i>

620
00:43:03,464 --> 00:43:05,625
I got to scoot.
I'll call you later though, okay?

621
00:43:05,699 --> 00:43:06,996
<i>All right, bye.</i>

622
00:43:15,976 --> 00:43:17,238
I can't.

623
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,403
- I can't do this.
- What?

624
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:23,305
Rock stars can't have girlfriends,
not real ones.

625
00:43:26,153 --> 00:43:29,782
- But I'm not a rock star. I'm a musician.
- Yeah, but you know what?

626
00:43:30,557 --> 00:43:34,994
You signed a contract,
and it's not a question of "if.' '

627
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,060
It's a question of "when.' '

628
00:43:37,665 --> 00:43:40,395
How do you know that?
How can you say that?

629
00:43:40,467 --> 00:43:41,764
How could you even...

630
00:43:44,138 --> 00:43:45,127
I'm sorry.

631
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:48,072
I'm sorry about everything,
especially last night.

632
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:51,374
I shouldn't have let it happen.

633
00:43:51,645 --> 00:43:54,273
Wait. Brier?

634
00:44:04,692 --> 00:44:05,681
Hey!

635
00:44:14,234 --> 00:44:15,462
Come back!

636
00:44:19,373 --> 00:44:20,772
What happened?

637
00:44:35,622 --> 00:44:40,059
<i>Stay with me a while</i>

638
00:44:40,894 --> 00:44:45,854
<i>And gently break me with your smile</i>

639
00:44:54,274 --> 00:44:55,400
Good.

640
00:44:56,143 --> 00:44:57,167
Very good.

641
00:44:57,244 --> 00:44:58,711
- You thought it was good?
- Yeah, very good.

642
00:44:58,779 --> 00:44:59,837
Very good.

643
00:44:59,913 --> 00:45:02,040
All right everybody, take a break.
Thank you very much.

644
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,016
- Nice, man. That was tight.
- Brendon.

645
00:45:04,251 --> 00:45:05,548
- Good set.
- Yeah.

646
00:45:05,619 --> 00:45:07,314
That was great, man.

647
00:45:07,755 --> 00:45:09,245
It's all good.

648
00:45:09,723 --> 00:45:12,123
- Jah rules.
- Yeah.

649
00:45:12,860 --> 00:45:15,021
You're going
to have to snap out of it, Luke.

650
00:45:15,129 --> 00:45:16,494
She's just one chick...

651
00:45:16,563 --> 00:45:19,657
and you're on the verge of finding out
just how many there are out there.

652
00:45:19,733 --> 00:45:23,225
- I know, I know. You're right.
- I'm not going to bullshit you, Luke.

653
00:45:23,637 --> 00:45:27,266
The state of mind you're in helped
with those last couple of songs...

654
00:45:27,341 --> 00:45:30,071
but we're done with the ballads now...

655
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:31,907
and we're moving on to the poppy stuff.

656
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,378
So you're going to have to...

657
00:45:35,449 --> 00:45:38,043
<i>snap the hell out of it, Luke!</i>

658
00:45:38,786 --> 00:45:41,254
I pay $10,000 a day for this place!

659
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:44,647
And remember this.

660
00:45:45,292 --> 00:45:47,123
It's not about the money.

661
00:45:49,730 --> 00:45:51,527
<i>It's about the money.</i>

662
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,760
No, I know, you're
right. I'm with you 100%.

663
00:45:55,836 --> 00:45:58,930
Screw 100%. I want more than 100%.

664
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:03,704
Do you have any idea what we have in store
for you over the next few weeks, huh?

665
00:46:03,777 --> 00:46:06,644
Brendon, could you come in here?
Please, Brendon.

666
00:46:06,713 --> 00:46:10,274
Tell him what we have scheduled for him
over the next couple of weeks.

667
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:12,545
Okay, we'll be in the studio 24l7.

668
00:46:12,619 --> 00:46:14,519
Starting next week,
we'll monitor your intake.

669
00:46:14,588 --> 00:46:17,648
No cigarettes, no alcohol.
No milk or citrus before recording.

670
00:46:17,724 --> 00:46:19,988
Bedtime to be strictly observed. 10:00 pm.

671
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,049
Thank you.

672
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,928
Welcome to Tantra.

673
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:32,798
I love this song, Luke. I love it!

674
00:46:36,410 --> 00:46:38,469
Okay, good. Great. Cool.

675
00:46:40,047 --> 00:46:42,982
<i>Death row just let us go</i>

676
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,143
<i>They ain't gonna make it</i>

677
00:46:46,854 --> 00:46:49,448
<i>I need a love of mine</i>

678
00:46:49,823 --> 00:46:53,190
<i>Your cold lines dancing on my spine</i>

679
00:46:53,327 --> 00:46:55,261
<i>You're headstrong</i>

680
00:46:55,329 --> 00:46:59,595
<i>Headstrong, uptight in your uniform</i>

681
00:47:00,501 --> 00:47:01,900
Okay, Luke.

682
00:47:01,969 --> 00:47:03,266
Let's take a break.

683
00:47:03,337 --> 00:47:06,101
I got a little something. We got you
a present for all your hard work.

684
00:47:06,173 --> 00:47:08,232
It's just a little something I whipped up.

685
00:47:08,308 --> 00:47:11,038
- I had no idea you were such a chef.
- Oh, yeah.

686
00:47:13,447 --> 00:47:16,382
<i>But hold tight I'll give you all I own</i>

687
00:47:16,450 --> 00:47:18,111
<i>Stay in my favors</i>

688
00:47:19,553 --> 00:47:21,350
Were you expecting someone else?

689
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:23,283
No, no, Josie.

690
00:47:23,857 --> 00:47:26,985
<i>Walk out where the lions lie</i>

691
00:47:27,060 --> 00:47:30,052
<i>And simply let it come undone</i>

692
00:47:30,464 --> 00:47:33,365
<i>Let the sickos stare</i>

693
00:47:33,834 --> 00:47:36,132
<i>'Cause they'll never have a love like ours</i>

694
00:47:36,203 --> 00:47:37,932
How about me. Do I get a little kiss?

695
00:47:38,005 --> 00:47:39,996
<i>Stay high with the falling stars</i>

696
00:47:42,676 --> 00:47:46,077
<i>This is living</i>

697
00:47:49,249 --> 00:47:53,447
<i>This is living</i>

698
00:48:00,694 --> 00:48:03,254
- I'm glad you made it.
- Sorry, I can't stay.

699
00:48:03,463 --> 00:48:04,930
But you just walked in the door, man.

700
00:48:04,998 --> 00:48:06,295
Yeah, I know, I know...

701
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,133
It's just, it's...

702
00:48:08,502 --> 00:48:10,333
It's just not our scene.

703
00:48:10,404 --> 00:48:13,100
Since when do you have a scene, man?
You gotta stay for my sax solo.

704
00:48:13,173 --> 00:48:15,505
We can't. I've got a party in the hills
we need to go to.

705
00:48:15,576 --> 00:48:16,770
If we get out early, I'll come back.

706
00:48:16,843 --> 00:48:18,868
I've been trying to get
in touch with you all week.

707
00:48:18,946 --> 00:48:21,107
I know. You're coming to
the Viper Room tomorrow, right?

708
00:48:21,181 --> 00:48:22,409
I'll see you there.

709
00:48:22,616 --> 00:48:24,641
Yeah. I don't really
know if that's my scene.

710
00:48:24,985 --> 00:48:27,249
You are so funny. I'll see you there.

711
00:48:32,926 --> 00:48:36,453
<i>This is living</i>

712
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:43,564
<i>This is living</i>

713
00:48:49,242 --> 00:48:51,005
There's Mick Benson!

714
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,932
You slept with him, didn't you?

715
00:49:22,009 --> 00:49:24,136
<i>No. We just messed around, but...</i>

716
00:49:24,344 --> 00:49:26,744
this is different. I thought I loved him.

717
00:49:26,813 --> 00:49:28,906
<i>- And now you don't?
- No.</i>

718
00:49:29,216 --> 00:49:31,446
I mean, maybe, yeah.

719
00:49:31,818 --> 00:49:33,786
<i>- Sometimes.
- Sometimes?</i>

720
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,285
What the hell does that mean?

721
00:49:35,355 --> 00:49:37,220
It means I'm mixed up.

722
00:49:37,691 --> 00:49:39,386
Mick's been looking for you.

723
00:49:39,493 --> 00:49:41,893
<i>- I can handle Mick.
- Maybe I should FedEx you...</i>

724
00:49:41,962 --> 00:49:43,657
<i>- some pepper spray.
- I'll be fine.</i>

725
00:49:43,730 --> 00:49:46,824
<i>- I can handle him.
- It's not Mick that I'm worried about.</i>

726
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:50,063
- You're not?
- I'm more worried about this Luke guy.

727
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:53,537
Carrie, I was the one who hit
the eject button on this, all right?

728
00:49:53,607 --> 00:49:55,666
Really? Or was it more like pause?

729
00:49:58,645 --> 00:50:00,442
Where are you gonna stay?

730
00:50:00,514 --> 00:50:03,506
You know, our drummer's brother's
roommate has a cousin.

731
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:08,013
He just moved in with his girlfriend,
so I'll just crash at his place.

732
00:50:08,088 --> 00:50:09,316
Why are you leaving?

733
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:11,454
So you can spend
some more time with your...

734
00:50:11,558 --> 00:50:13,719
- psycho Brazilian girlfriend.
- Which means?

735
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:16,226
- Which means, specifically?
- Yeah, specifically.

736
00:50:16,329 --> 00:50:18,559
It means you're dating Darth Vader in drag.

737
00:50:18,632 --> 00:50:20,657
No. She's not like that.

738
00:50:20,734 --> 00:50:22,793
Look, man, you don't have to
go out with a girl who's...

739
00:50:22,869 --> 00:50:24,700
Iooking over your shoulder
every five minutes...

740
00:50:24,771 --> 00:50:26,739
to see if Leonardo DiCaprio
just walked in the room.

741
00:50:26,807 --> 00:50:28,274
In LA? Not happening.

742
00:50:28,341 --> 00:50:30,502
Then move. Get the hell out of here.

743
00:50:30,610 --> 00:50:33,170
Or better yet, find a girl
who just moved here.

744
00:50:33,246 --> 00:50:36,682
Do you know anyone like that? Do you
know anyone that just moved here, Luke?

745
00:50:36,750 --> 00:50:38,684
I got a photo spread to go to.
You wanna come?

746
00:50:38,752 --> 00:50:42,017
- I would love to. Can I?
- Yeah. I'll see you there.

747
00:50:43,990 --> 00:50:45,787
Take pretty pictures.

748
00:51:00,273 --> 00:51:02,002
Old habits die hard.

749
00:51:03,643 --> 00:51:06,510
I knew I should have gotten
a restraining order.

750
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,706
- Hello, Mick.
- Hello, love.

751
00:51:10,717 --> 00:51:12,344
I brought you a box of Ho-Hos.

752
00:51:12,419 --> 00:51:14,444
Cut it out with the "love" crap.

753
00:51:14,621 --> 00:51:15,781
We just wrapped LA.

754
00:51:15,856 --> 00:51:19,485
We're gonna come back and do
another gig next week after San Diego.

755
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:21,254
I was kind of hoping you'd come.

756
00:51:21,595 --> 00:51:23,256
You were hoping wrong.

757
00:51:26,433 --> 00:51:28,628
The boys keep asking about you.

758
00:51:29,703 --> 00:51:31,796
I did rather enjoy hearing about the...

759
00:51:31,872 --> 00:51:35,308
- rabbit-eared twins?
- They just wanted publicity.

760
00:51:35,375 --> 00:51:38,742
Look, I'm sorry, baby.
I should have made us a priority.

761
00:51:41,748 --> 00:51:43,545
I can forgive you, Mick.

762
00:51:44,084 --> 00:51:46,348
I just can't forget how you treated me.

763
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:49,420
There's a start.

764
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,987
Come and have dinner with me
next week after the show.

765
00:51:52,058 --> 00:51:54,253
- No, thanks.
- Come on, Bri. For old time's sake.

766
00:51:54,327 --> 00:51:57,660
- We used to have a lot of fun together.
- Yeah, before you screwed everything up.

767
00:51:57,731 --> 00:52:00,495
You're right.
I did, and I want to make it up to you.

768
00:52:00,634 --> 00:52:03,330
Look, we weren't just lovers.

769
00:52:03,637 --> 00:52:05,195
You were my best friend.

770
00:52:06,106 --> 00:52:08,006
- Come and have dinner with me.
- No.

771
00:52:08,074 --> 00:52:09,336
Come and have lunch with me.

772
00:52:09,409 --> 00:52:11,172
You don't even wake up before 5:00.

773
00:52:11,244 --> 00:52:14,771
You're right. So lets have a very
early dinner at 6:00 before the show.

774
00:52:14,981 --> 00:52:17,347
It is still light at 6:00, you know.

775
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:18,882
Not long enough.

776
00:52:19,486 --> 00:52:21,044
Bri, please.

777
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:25,051
There are some things
that I really need to say to you.

778
00:52:26,526 --> 00:52:28,289
I have to go pee.

779
00:52:31,164 --> 00:52:32,495
Hey, Mick.

780
00:52:32,766 --> 00:52:35,064
Mick, can you sign a ball for me?

781
00:52:36,169 --> 00:52:38,569
My sisters are your biggest fans.

782
00:52:38,638 --> 00:52:41,505
Even before they both won
the Miss World Bikini.

783
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:45,802
- Both of them?
- Yeah. They're twins.

784
00:52:47,747 --> 00:52:48,941
How long ago was that?

785
00:52:49,015 --> 00:52:52,143
- They've always been twins.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know. I realize that.

786
00:52:52,552 --> 00:52:54,611
How long ago did they win the...

787
00:52:54,688 --> 00:52:56,519
- Swimming competition?
- It was about a year ago.

788
00:52:56,590 --> 00:53:00,082
My mother made them wait to enter
until they both turned 18.

789
00:53:00,827 --> 00:53:02,624
Look. I got pictures of them.

790
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:05,159
<i>You're at Mick's place, aren't you?</i>

791
00:53:05,232 --> 00:53:07,427
<i>- He found you.
- What? No.</i>

792
00:53:07,500 --> 00:53:09,297
I'm in the men's bathroom.

793
00:53:09,402 --> 00:53:11,063
Well, it could be worse.

794
00:53:11,705 --> 00:53:14,572
- Can you smell him from where you are?
- What? No.

795
00:53:14,641 --> 00:53:17,371
We've talked about this stuff, remember?

796
00:53:17,577 --> 00:53:19,670
<i>- Pheromones?
- You really believe in that crap?</i>

797
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:21,371
I absolutely do.

798
00:53:21,481 --> 00:53:24,177
<i>Do you have any perfume on you?</i>

799
00:53:24,317 --> 00:53:25,545
Yeah.

800
00:53:25,685 --> 00:53:27,516
I have some Possession.

801
00:53:27,587 --> 00:53:28,747
That's ironic.

802
00:53:28,822 --> 00:53:30,153
Thank you, Carrie.

803
00:53:30,357 --> 00:53:32,518
<i>Look. What I need you to do is spray...</i>

804
00:53:32,592 --> 00:53:34,685
a whole lot of it on your fingertips...

805
00:53:34,761 --> 00:53:38,026
and then I need you to rub the insides
of both your nostrils.

806
00:53:38,098 --> 00:53:40,191
Good Lord. Hold on, okay?

807
00:53:48,375 --> 00:53:49,603
Mother...

808
00:53:52,412 --> 00:53:53,743
Look here.

809
00:53:54,147 --> 00:53:57,116
<i>That's little Mamita,
and we call her La Nia.</i>

810
00:53:57,450 --> 00:53:58,849
That's by the pool.

811
00:53:58,919 --> 00:54:01,547
- God bless you.
- Thank you.

812
00:54:12,599 --> 00:54:15,090
His mother's very sick
and she's a big fan of mine...

813
00:54:15,168 --> 00:54:17,261
so I said I'd send her some CDs.

814
00:54:17,737 --> 00:54:20,900
So sorry to hear that. So sweet of you.

815
00:54:21,975 --> 00:54:23,169
You should also know that...

816
00:54:31,017 --> 00:54:33,212
So, that being said...

817
00:54:33,787 --> 00:54:35,118
<i>buenas noches.</i>

818
00:54:38,191 --> 00:54:40,682
- Mick, I'm sorry about that, man.
- Yeah. Whatever.

819
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:42,421
Hey, don't be like
that. Let me get a Ho-Ho.

820
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,588
Come on, man. Don't be like that, dawg.

821
00:54:45,432 --> 00:54:48,401
Mick hears what he
wants to hear, but, yeah...

822
00:54:49,102 --> 00:54:50,899
things run their course, you know?

823
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:54,362
Besides, it's more of a physical thing.

824
00:54:55,008 --> 00:54:57,135
Okay. Assuming that I believe you...

825
00:54:57,243 --> 00:54:58,835
which, by the way, I don't...

826
00:54:58,945 --> 00:55:01,175
what are you gonna do about Luke?

827
00:55:01,247 --> 00:55:04,011
And, by the way, he's not coming here.

828
00:55:04,584 --> 00:55:07,417
Bri, hello. It's not him.

829
00:55:07,754 --> 00:55:08,982
- Hi.
- Hi.

830
00:55:11,291 --> 00:55:12,758
I don't know.

831
00:55:13,259 --> 00:55:14,920
Guys just get in the way.

832
00:55:15,695 --> 00:55:17,595
Besides, I have you, don't I?

833
00:55:18,164 --> 00:55:19,324
Right.

834
00:55:19,466 --> 00:55:21,366
So sad.

835
00:55:43,623 --> 00:55:47,024
You ever had that feeling like
you're in two places at once?

836
00:55:48,028 --> 00:55:50,997
Lukey, come on. Come over here.

837
00:55:51,464 --> 00:55:53,125
You need to relax.

838
00:55:53,833 --> 00:55:55,562
You go on in half an hour.

839
00:56:10,216 --> 00:56:11,706
I'm sorry.

840
00:56:14,254 --> 00:56:16,119
I'm not ready for this.

841
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:29,594
<i>Oh, praise God, I'm all in fear</i>

842
00:56:29,669 --> 00:56:33,070
<i>So hoping my soul is yours</i>

843
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:36,370
<i>Oh, dear God, my love is strong</i>

844
00:56:36,443 --> 00:56:39,708
<i>Throw this dog another bone</i>

845
00:56:42,115 --> 00:56:46,415
<i>This is living</i>

846
00:56:48,721 --> 00:56:52,657
<i>This is living</i>

847
00:56:53,126 --> 00:56:55,390
<i>Maybe I can see you in the evening</i>

848
00:56:55,462 --> 00:56:58,124
<i>With the light on</i>

849
00:57:03,570 --> 00:57:06,403
<i>Death row, just let us go</i>

850
00:57:06,473 --> 00:57:08,839
<i>They ain't gonna make it</i>

851
00:57:09,676 --> 00:57:11,576
You are so hot!

852
00:57:11,644 --> 00:57:13,874
Let's see what you got.

853
00:57:17,450 --> 00:57:20,351
Stay off the stage, you bitch!

854
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:21,887
You're the bitch!

855
00:57:41,808 --> 00:57:42,968
Luke!

856
00:57:46,279 --> 00:57:48,543
I'm trying to see the show.

857
00:57:49,983 --> 00:57:53,214
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

858
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:03,718
Hello?

859
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,096
Come on in.

860
00:58:09,269 --> 00:58:10,531
Luke?

861
00:58:12,338 --> 00:58:14,067
- Hi.
- Oh, hey, what's happening?

862
00:58:14,174 --> 00:58:15,436
You moving?

863
00:58:15,542 --> 00:58:17,009
Yeah.

864
00:58:17,143 --> 00:58:18,542
I gotta get out of here.

865
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:21,107
You can actually help me.
It's just a block.

866
00:58:21,314 --> 00:58:23,714
- Okay.
- There's not enough room in here for...

867
00:58:24,217 --> 00:58:27,311
Luke, his gigantic ego,
and his fantastic girlfriend.

868
00:58:28,121 --> 00:58:29,611
I didn't know he had a girlfriend.

869
00:58:29,889 --> 00:58:32,585
Yeah. You know that South American
wombat he's been seeing?

870
00:58:32,659 --> 00:58:35,150
Who, by the way,
is about as smart as that plant.

871
00:58:35,228 --> 00:58:37,162
Yeah. I thought they were just friends.

872
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:39,288
They were just friends
until a couple of weeks ago...

873
00:58:39,365 --> 00:58:40,525
when she made her big move.

874
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,329
Wait, hold on. She's moving in?

875
00:58:42,535 --> 00:58:45,834
No. She's not moving in. She's just...

876
00:58:46,072 --> 00:58:47,972
A love taxi. Don't worry about it.

877
00:58:48,174 --> 00:58:49,334
A what?

878
00:58:49,409 --> 00:58:52,207
Luke's just taking a ride. It won't last.

879
00:58:53,146 --> 00:58:54,773
How do you know it won't last?

880
00:58:54,847 --> 00:58:56,542
Because I've only seen
Luke in love two times.

881
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:58,413
The first time was with Wendy Marcus.

882
00:58:58,484 --> 00:59:01,214
And that girl drove him to poetry. So...

883
00:59:01,654 --> 00:59:03,144
That's sweet.

884
00:59:03,556 --> 00:59:07,515
Yeah, she was the hot girl in seventh grade
that every guy had a crush on...

885
00:59:07,594 --> 00:59:09,152
and Luke was just the one who...

886
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:10,523
Got some?

887
00:59:11,431 --> 00:59:14,229
- Got kneed in the groin, actually.
- Ouch.

888
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,824
But, you know, that's...

889
00:59:15,902 --> 00:59:18,837
what love is sometimes.
But it doesn't always have to be that way.

890
00:59:19,339 --> 00:59:21,830
You know? Sometimes it actually works out
between two people.

891
00:59:21,908 --> 00:59:24,502
Especially if one of them
is willing to take a chance.

892
00:59:24,577 --> 00:59:26,101
What, your brother?

893
00:59:26,679 --> 00:59:30,445
Are you denying that there is something
between you guys? Seriously.

894
00:59:31,584 --> 00:59:33,017
I don't know.

895
00:59:33,286 --> 00:59:34,685
I don't know. It's just...

896
00:59:34,787 --> 00:59:39,053
He's had a little success,
and look what he's turned into.

897
00:59:39,692 --> 00:59:43,184
This is not gonna last, I promise you that.
Luke is loyal...

898
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:46,426
This is my place. He's kind to animals.

899
00:59:47,600 --> 00:59:49,898
I would go out with the guy.
If he weren't a guy.

900
00:59:49,969 --> 00:59:52,665
And if he weren't my brother, I guess.

901
00:59:52,739 --> 00:59:54,639
So Wendy Marcus and who?

902
00:59:56,075 --> 00:59:58,270
- What?
- You said two loves.

903
00:59:59,245 --> 01:00:00,644
Women have this amazing ability...

904
01:00:00,713 --> 01:00:02,908
to hear something in the beginning
of a conversation...

905
01:00:02,982 --> 01:00:04,711
and just, like, bring
it right back into the...

906
01:00:04,784 --> 01:00:06,376
Wendy Marcus and who?

907
01:00:06,552 --> 01:00:08,611
Why don't you just ask him yourself?

908
01:00:09,489 --> 01:00:11,354
- Okay, Brier?
- Okay.

909
01:00:12,225 --> 01:00:13,920
- Good night.
- So long.

910
01:00:15,461 --> 01:00:17,827
- You go get him.
- I'll try.

911
01:00:23,670 --> 01:00:26,901
They locked me
in a room upstairs for an hour.

912
01:00:27,307 --> 01:00:28,865
Like a criminal. Okay?

913
01:00:28,941 --> 01:00:30,875
- Assault is against the law.
- Whatever.

914
01:00:30,943 --> 01:00:32,410
- Hi.
- Hi.

915
01:00:32,478 --> 01:00:35,743
- Okay, so tell me, did you date her?
- I didn't go out with her.

916
01:00:36,482 --> 01:00:39,144
We went out
before you and I were anything.

917
01:00:40,853 --> 01:00:42,081
And?

918
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:43,813
And then she blew me off.

919
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:47,020
You have a lot in common.

920
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:52,254
All right. You know what?

921
01:00:55,234 --> 01:00:58,897
You have no idea what a joke you are.
Okay?

922
01:00:59,639 --> 01:01:02,938
They hired me to get you noticed. Yeah.

923
01:01:03,810 --> 01:01:05,175
But she knows.

924
01:01:05,878 --> 01:01:07,311
It was her idea.

925
01:01:17,724 --> 01:01:19,055
Excuse me.

926
01:01:19,459 --> 01:01:20,619
Wait.

927
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:24,495
So you just pretended to like the music.

928
01:01:24,564 --> 01:01:26,794
No, no, no. We all really liked the music.

929
01:01:26,866 --> 01:01:28,800
We just, we pretended we liked you...

930
01:01:28,868 --> 01:01:30,665
like, liked you, liked you.

931
01:01:30,737 --> 01:01:32,705
I can't believe I fell for that.
I'm such an idiot.

932
01:01:32,772 --> 01:01:35,468
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

933
01:01:35,575 --> 01:01:37,167
God, she's pissed.

934
01:01:38,711 --> 01:01:41,407
Look. All we tried to do, listen...

935
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:43,548
was try to make a nice guy a rock star.

936
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:46,483
I'm not a rock star. I'm not even close.

937
01:01:46,552 --> 01:01:48,213
But you want to be.

938
01:01:48,287 --> 01:01:50,118
No, wait. Look.

939
01:01:50,890 --> 01:01:52,357
I really like you.

940
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:55,552
But the last place that I can be
because of my past...

941
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:56,890
Mick?

942
01:01:56,996 --> 01:01:59,760
- How did you know...
- Euan googled you.

943
01:02:01,100 --> 01:02:03,193
- I never meant to hurt you...
- Yeah, well, news flash.

944
01:02:03,269 --> 01:02:06,204
You didn't hurt me. You killed me.
Thank you.

945
01:02:27,393 --> 01:02:29,827
Josie, musicians, they're scum.

946
01:02:29,896 --> 01:02:32,797
They can't help themselves.
I know these things.

947
01:02:32,899 --> 01:02:37,063
You need someone older, more mature,
who can really pay attention to you.

948
01:02:37,136 --> 01:02:39,934
Trust me. Let's have some coffee.

949
01:02:42,875 --> 01:02:44,206
He faked everyone out.

950
01:02:44,277 --> 01:02:47,610
All those people that you met that night,
they were just out of work actors...

951
01:02:47,680 --> 01:02:49,978
that were pretending to like him
so that you would sign him.

952
01:02:50,049 --> 01:02:51,880
- All of them?
- Yeah.

953
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:54,244
- Are you serious?
- Hello.

954
01:02:54,387 --> 01:02:56,218
What can I get for you today?

955
01:02:56,756 --> 01:02:59,782
I believe that you've met Jason Bond...

956
01:02:59,992 --> 01:03:01,550
from Elektra.

957
01:03:04,764 --> 01:03:06,823
No hard feelings, dude.

958
01:03:06,999 --> 01:03:08,364
- Muffin?
- Bond.

959
01:03:08,734 --> 01:03:10,224
I'm gonna kill you!

960
01:03:10,736 --> 01:03:11,964
I'm gonna kill you!

961
01:03:12,805 --> 01:03:14,796
- Dude, you're gonna get me fired.
- I don't care!

962
01:03:14,874 --> 01:03:17,707
You're nothing, Bond! You're meat!

963
01:03:17,777 --> 01:03:20,473
I'm very sorry to report that
as of this moment...

964
01:03:20,546 --> 01:03:22,480
Luke Falcon...

965
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:25,108
will no longer be part of our roster.

966
01:03:25,451 --> 01:03:28,045
Luke is battling many, many demons...

967
01:03:28,454 --> 01:03:31,651
including the one where you
can't even leave your house.

968
01:03:31,724 --> 01:03:33,214
Arachnophobia.

969
01:03:33,459 --> 01:03:36,485
- Fear of spiders.
- And he has a fear of spiders.

970
01:03:36,629 --> 01:03:39,689
<i>Bill from Santa Monica,
you're on with Luke Falcon.</i>

971
01:03:39,765 --> 01:03:43,667
<i>Yo, Luke. I just read on the internet
you just got dropped from your label, man.</i>

972
01:03:45,471 --> 01:03:48,565
Tantra!

973
01:03:50,042 --> 01:03:52,135
Let's go to war, gentlemen.

974
01:03:56,148 --> 01:03:57,672
I can't do this.

975
01:03:59,719 --> 01:04:02,187
<i>Luke, this is Brendon
from Garrett's office.</i>

976
01:04:02,755 --> 01:04:04,916
<i>Listen. Garrett wanted
me to let you know...</i>

977
01:04:04,991 --> 01:04:07,585
<i>that we've decided not to go forward
with your record.</i>

978
01:04:07,660 --> 01:04:10,561
<i>And for that matter,
we won't be picking up our option.</i>

979
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:12,361
<i>Sorry to be...</i>

980
01:04:13,399 --> 01:04:16,129
<i>Hey, Luke, it's Brendon.
We need to get the work...</i>

981
01:04:16,969 --> 01:04:19,665
<i>Hey, Luke, I haven't heard
from you in a while...</i>

982
01:04:20,473 --> 01:04:22,873
<i>Luke, yo, it's Ramon from the Dragonfly.</i>

983
01:04:22,942 --> 01:04:24,842
<i>I'm gonna have to cancel your show
for next week.</i>

984
01:04:24,911 --> 01:04:27,903
<i>I'll call you back in a couple of months
if anything opens up.</i>

985
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:31,344
<i>This message is for Luke Falcon.</i>

986
01:04:31,417 --> 01:04:33,385
<i>This is Peggy from Tantra leasing.</i>

987
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:35,784
<i>It seems that last month's Porsche
payment didn't arrive.</i>

988
01:04:35,855 --> 01:04:39,621
<i>As you might have guessed, we consider
the first payment to be very important.</i>

989
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:42,557
<i>Any questions, I can be reached...</i>

990
01:04:43,129 --> 01:04:44,687
That's it. Good to go.

991
01:04:47,133 --> 01:04:49,158
Hey! That's my car!

992
01:04:49,235 --> 01:04:51,135
<i>I'm not here right now, so leave a message.</i>

993
01:04:51,237 --> 01:04:53,137
<i>Hey, Luke, it's Brier.</i>

994
01:04:53,506 --> 01:04:56,134
<i>I know. I've officially crossed over
into stalking territory...</i>

995
01:04:56,208 --> 01:04:58,733
<i>Hey, Luke, it's your brother.
You remember me?</i>

996
01:04:58,811 --> 01:05:01,746
<i>Look, my place is right up the street.
Why don't you come check it out?</i>

997
01:05:03,049 --> 01:05:06,177
<i>This is Luke.
I'm not here right now, so leave a message.</i>

998
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:09,716
<i>Hey, Luke. It's Brier.</i>

999
01:05:10,222 --> 01:05:14,420
<i>I'm really worried
about you and I miss you.</i>

1000
01:05:15,127 --> 01:05:18,062
<i>I want you to call me back. Okay?</i>

1001
01:05:22,868 --> 01:05:23,835
He's really mad.

1002
01:05:26,072 --> 01:05:28,802
Yeah. And he might need to be
bitch slapped.

1003
01:05:29,875 --> 01:05:31,274
But he'll be all right.

1004
01:05:32,645 --> 01:05:35,341
You're gonna have to get me out of this.

1005
01:05:41,220 --> 01:05:43,848
Maybe it's when you realize
how much you miss her...

1006
01:05:43,990 --> 01:05:47,357
and how it's, like,
the feeling of being hurt...

1007
01:05:47,426 --> 01:05:50,418
feeling like you need somebody so much.

1008
01:05:52,231 --> 01:05:54,222
Like such an empty feeling.
You know what I mean?

1009
01:05:54,300 --> 01:05:55,733
- No, I do.
- I'd just dump him.

1010
01:05:56,435 --> 01:05:58,232
I don't even think about him.

1011
01:05:59,639 --> 01:06:02,267
- You ready? You want to do it again?
- Yeah. Sure.

1012
01:06:04,944 --> 01:06:08,573
<i>Take it back, take it all back now</i>

1013
01:06:08,814 --> 01:06:10,543
<i>The things I gave</i>

1014
01:06:10,616 --> 01:06:14,484
<i>Like the taste of my kiss on your lips</i>

1015
01:06:16,022 --> 01:06:18,149
<i>I miss that now</i>

1016
01:06:18,424 --> 01:06:19,618
Chorus.

1017
01:06:21,260 --> 01:06:24,388
<i>All the things left undiscovered</i>

1018
01:06:24,463 --> 01:06:25,521
That's good. Go.

1019
01:06:25,631 --> 01:06:29,328
<i>Leave me empty and left to wonder</i>

1020
01:06:30,670 --> 01:06:33,195
<i>Now I need you</i>

1021
01:06:34,874 --> 01:06:37,536
<i>Yeah, I need you</i>

1022
01:06:38,010 --> 01:06:39,944
<i>Don't walk away</i>

1023
01:06:40,012 --> 01:06:41,206
Two, three...

1024
01:06:41,280 --> 01:06:42,508
<i>Away</i>

1025
01:06:47,486 --> 01:06:49,078
God, I've been such a jerk.

1026
01:06:49,822 --> 01:06:51,653
We were the ones who screwed up.

1027
01:06:51,857 --> 01:06:54,348
We let it go way too far...

1028
01:06:54,727 --> 01:06:56,092
and I'm sorry.

1029
01:06:56,195 --> 01:06:57,287
And I know she is.

1030
01:06:57,363 --> 01:06:59,763
- At least we got a song out of it.
- But it was inevitable.

1031
01:07:00,066 --> 01:07:01,761
It was only gonna be short-term.
We knew that.

1032
01:07:01,834 --> 01:07:05,326
How about it?
Shortest music career in history.

1033
01:07:06,472 --> 01:07:07,939
It's not about careers.

1034
01:07:08,074 --> 01:07:11,339
In music, passions enjoy themselves.

1035
01:07:11,444 --> 01:07:13,571
- Yeah.
- Oh, nice, yeah.

1036
01:07:13,679 --> 01:07:15,237
That makes sense.

1037
01:07:17,083 --> 01:07:18,482
Is that a phone?

1038
01:07:19,552 --> 01:07:21,747
Ring tones. It's the future. Hello.

1039
01:07:23,456 --> 01:07:27,017
That's what happens when you
try to give yourself a colonic.

1040
01:07:27,493 --> 01:07:29,984
- I'm surprised the guy can even stand up.
- Yuck.

1041
01:07:30,096 --> 01:07:32,530
Drink a lot of fluids, I guess, and...

1042
01:07:34,467 --> 01:07:37,732
You know what? Actually, I think I'm
looking at the solution to your problem...

1043
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:38,895
right now.

1044
01:07:39,004 --> 01:07:41,097
Let me call you right back, all right?

1045
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:44,939
- Hey, little brother.
- Yeah?

1046
01:07:45,311 --> 01:07:47,279
How would you feel about...

1047
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:49,811
getting a little funky?

1048
01:07:53,853 --> 01:07:56,686
<i>I met you on somebody's island</i>

1049
01:07:56,956 --> 01:07:59,891
<i>You thought you had known me before</i>

1050
01:08:00,493 --> 01:08:03,519
<i>I brought you a crate of papaya</i>

1051
01:08:03,696 --> 01:08:06,290
<i>And waited all night by your door</i>

1052
01:08:07,099 --> 01:08:09,829
<i>You probably wouldn't remember</i>

1053
01:08:10,169 --> 01:08:13,195
<i>I probably couldn't forget</i>

1054
01:08:13,272 --> 01:08:16,935
<i>Jungle love in the surf in the pouring rain</i>

1055
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:19,876
<i>Everything's better when wet</i>

1056
01:08:21,046 --> 01:08:24,209
<i>Jungle love, it's driving me mad</i>

1057
01:08:24,283 --> 01:08:26,911
<i>It's making me crazy</i>

1058
01:08:27,787 --> 01:08:30,950
<i>Jungle love, it's driving me mad</i>

1059
01:08:31,056 --> 01:08:33,854
<i>It's making me crazy, crazy</i>

1060
01:08:33,959 --> 01:08:37,520
<i>Jungle love, it's driving me mad</i>

1061
01:08:37,596 --> 01:08:40,565
<i>It's making me crazy, crazy</i>

1062
01:08:40,866 --> 01:08:43,835
<i>Jungle love, it's driving me mad</i>

1063
01:08:43,903 --> 01:08:47,168
<i>It's making me crazy</i>

1064
01:08:48,140 --> 01:08:51,303
- Who's getting the hot chicks now?
- Nice thong, man.

1065
01:09:05,357 --> 01:09:08,053
Here are your plane tickets
for the redeye on Monday night.

1066
01:09:08,127 --> 01:09:12,723
You'll have one day in New York and then
you're off to the Caribbean for two days.

1067
01:09:12,798 --> 01:09:14,356
I don't know if I can do this.

1068
01:09:14,433 --> 01:09:16,367
You better suck it up, girlie.

1069
01:09:16,435 --> 01:09:18,232
This one's non-negotiable.

1070
01:09:18,304 --> 01:09:19,862
You're a fan of tough love.

1071
01:09:19,939 --> 01:09:22,908
No, when I am being tough with you,
you'll know it.

1072
01:09:23,509 --> 01:09:26,501
Now, when do I get
to meet this Luke character?

1073
01:09:26,779 --> 01:09:29,111
- I don't know. He won't talk to me.
- Why?

1074
01:09:29,281 --> 01:09:31,715
All you tried to do
was jump-start his career.

1075
01:09:31,817 --> 01:09:33,614
Quite selflessly, I might add.

1076
01:09:33,686 --> 01:09:36,120
- Before it turned to crap.
- Oh, come on.

1077
01:09:36,255 --> 01:09:37,847
That remains to be seen.

1078
01:09:39,725 --> 01:09:42,159
- You want to get out of here?
- Oh, please, God.

1079
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:46,288
I want to meet some of these
LA hipster friends of yours.

1080
01:09:52,171 --> 01:09:53,934
Okay, here it comes.

1081
01:09:54,006 --> 01:09:55,906
Just remember, you gotta smile.

1082
01:09:55,975 --> 01:09:58,739
You gotta...
Oh, God, he looks awfully mean.

1083
01:09:58,878 --> 01:10:00,072
Smile.

1084
01:10:00,512 --> 01:10:01,843
Hi. Excuse me.

1085
01:10:01,914 --> 01:10:03,939
Hi. I'm Brier.

1086
01:10:04,016 --> 01:10:05,347
- How are you?
- I'm Clea.

1087
01:10:05,417 --> 01:10:08,477
Hi. This is Clea.
We were wondering about Luke.

1088
01:10:08,587 --> 01:10:11,988
We haven't seen him here in a while.
We adore him. We adore him.

1089
01:10:12,057 --> 01:10:13,581
Oh, my God. What color are your eyes?

1090
01:10:23,602 --> 01:10:25,160
Think positive.

1091
01:10:28,407 --> 01:10:30,432
<i>Hey, Luke. It's Ben from The Mint.</i>

1092
01:10:30,509 --> 01:10:31,669
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

1093
01:10:31,744 --> 01:10:34,679
<i>It's a shot in the dark, but I was hoping
you could fill in next Monday.</i>

1094
01:10:34,747 --> 01:10:37,307
<i>- Give me a call.
- Thank God.</i>

1095
01:10:51,497 --> 01:10:53,488
Excuse me. Hello.

1096
01:10:55,134 --> 01:10:56,965
I have an announcement to make.

1097
01:10:57,269 --> 01:10:58,896
This looks serious.

1098
01:11:00,272 --> 01:11:02,467
I've made a decision, and...

1099
01:11:02,708 --> 01:11:04,471
I'm moving back to New York.

1100
01:11:04,543 --> 01:11:06,841
To the intellectually stimulating
world of modeling.

1101
01:11:06,912 --> 01:11:09,312
Yes. That and...

1102
01:11:09,581 --> 01:11:13,540
in pursuit of landing
an off-off-off-Broadway part.

1103
01:11:14,119 --> 01:11:15,450
Just like that?

1104
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:18,414
Wow. Where did this come from?

1105
01:11:18,490 --> 01:11:21,789
I don't know. I miss the change in seasons.

1106
01:11:25,998 --> 01:11:28,023
I gotta do something different.

1107
01:11:32,404 --> 01:11:34,736
- It's good, right?
- It's great, Brier.

1108
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:37,740
I think it's great.

1109
01:11:40,012 --> 01:11:41,172
Clea...

1110
01:11:43,449 --> 01:11:45,440
You understand, don't you?

1111
01:11:52,491 --> 01:11:53,617
Euan?

1112
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:56,486
Euan?

1113
01:11:58,230 --> 01:11:59,219
Euan?

1114
01:11:59,765 --> 01:12:01,699
- What?
- Can I talk to you for a second?

1115
01:12:01,767 --> 01:12:04,930
Yeah, but these girls really
aren't getting enough potassium, so...

1116
01:12:05,004 --> 01:12:07,495
- Yeah, I can see.
- Do you think what Brier did was lame?

1117
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:09,632
No, not lame. A little
Machiavellian, maybe.

1118
01:12:09,708 --> 01:12:12,074
- What does Brier have to gain?
- Nothing. She's just trying...

1119
01:12:12,144 --> 01:12:13,304
- Come on, baby.
- I'm coming.

1120
01:12:13,379 --> 01:12:15,347
She's just trying to
send you a little white light.

1121
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:17,245
All right, so basically
I'm an ungrateful ass.

1122
01:12:17,316 --> 01:12:19,216
Yeah, pretty much. That's you.

1123
01:12:23,489 --> 01:12:25,423
<i>The mobile subscriber
you're trying to reach...</i>

1124
01:12:25,491 --> 01:12:27,857
<i>is not available at this time.</i>

1125
01:12:49,114 --> 01:12:50,979
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.

1126
01:12:51,050 --> 01:12:53,075
Fastest round-trip ticket I've ever seen.

1127
01:12:53,152 --> 01:12:54,642
I heard he has a drug problem.

1128
01:12:54,720 --> 01:12:56,119
- Horse tranquilizers.
- Really?

1129
01:12:56,188 --> 01:12:59,419
'Cause I heard the marketing guy
said he's too '90s.

1130
01:12:59,491 --> 01:13:02,460
All I know is I hope his set is short.
My band's going on right after.

1131
01:13:02,528 --> 01:13:03,688
I wouldn't worry about it.

1132
01:13:03,762 --> 01:13:05,992
Things will be fine. Horse tranquilizer?

1133
01:13:06,065 --> 01:13:07,327
Thanks.

1134
01:13:08,901 --> 01:13:11,062
Hey. Hey, check it out.

1135
01:13:13,205 --> 01:13:14,433
She is smoking hot.

1136
01:13:14,540 --> 01:13:17,566
Not the girl, you idiot.
You know who that guy is?

1137
01:13:18,143 --> 01:13:20,338
- Who, the old guy?
- Yeah.

1138
01:13:20,913 --> 01:13:22,813
It's Wick Treadway, man.

1139
01:13:23,015 --> 01:13:25,848
I've never seen this guy out, man.
This is big.

1140
01:13:26,585 --> 01:13:28,450
His non-compete must be up.

1141
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:31,114
I gotta berry Garrett in on this one, man.

1142
01:13:42,301 --> 01:13:44,235
- Where's Brier?
- She just couldn't come in.

1143
01:13:44,303 --> 01:13:45,827
She'll meet you in your limo.

1144
01:13:45,904 --> 01:13:47,735
How do you guys know each other?

1145
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:51,834
I'm the one who convinced him
to get out of the music industry.

1146
01:13:51,977 --> 01:13:54,070
It was one of her fabulous little rules.

1147
01:13:54,146 --> 01:13:56,011
What the hell was that rule? Buy...

1148
01:13:56,081 --> 01:13:57,275
Buy a mystery...

1149
01:13:57,349 --> 01:13:59,044
Sell on history.

1150
01:13:59,118 --> 01:14:00,676
The historic internet had just arrived.

1151
01:14:00,786 --> 01:14:03,380
We were shacked up in this little house
she had up in the canyon.

1152
01:14:03,455 --> 01:14:05,150
- You still got that house in the canyon?
- Yes.

1153
01:14:05,224 --> 01:14:07,749
We were shacked up in this little house
about 5:00 a.m.

1154
01:14:07,826 --> 01:14:10,260
She's lying next to me.
She pops up like burned toast...

1155
01:14:10,329 --> 01:14:12,388
starts screaming about music file sharing.

1156
01:14:12,464 --> 01:14:14,659
"Music file sharing! Music file sharing!"

1157
01:14:14,733 --> 01:14:16,724
Scared the hell out of me.
I stared selling that day.

1158
01:14:16,802 --> 01:14:19,134
Wait. You guys were together?

1159
01:14:19,738 --> 01:14:21,831
You could say that. We were...

1160
01:14:21,907 --> 01:14:23,932
What is the word? Married.

1161
01:14:24,009 --> 01:14:25,533
We were married.

1162
01:14:26,745 --> 01:14:27,905
Hello?

1163
01:14:28,080 --> 01:14:30,173
Wait, did you bring him here for Luke?

1164
01:14:30,349 --> 01:14:32,146
Well, he was sort of coming here anyway.

1165
01:14:32,251 --> 01:14:33,741
It's still good that he sees him, though.

1166
01:14:33,819 --> 01:14:36,185
A little J.P. Morgan walkabout.

1167
01:14:36,555 --> 01:14:37,749
What's that?

1168
01:14:38,490 --> 01:14:40,924
- Tell it, baby. Tell it.
- It's a famous story.

1169
01:14:40,993 --> 01:14:43,985
J.P. Had a friend of a friend
ask him to help a pal out.

1170
01:14:44,096 --> 01:14:46,087
So he looked at this guy's plan...

1171
01:14:46,198 --> 01:14:48,428
and he knows in a minute
he's not gonna finance it.

1172
01:14:48,500 --> 01:14:50,593
So he does the menschy thing, though.

1173
01:14:50,669 --> 01:14:52,466
He asked the guy to lunch...

1174
01:14:53,105 --> 01:14:54,333
and after lunch...

1175
01:14:54,406 --> 01:14:57,773
he takes him and walks him
all around Lower Manhattan...

1176
01:14:57,943 --> 01:14:59,103
with his arm around him.

1177
01:14:59,178 --> 01:15:02,238
So that when the guy who wanted
the money gets back to his office...

1178
01:15:02,347 --> 01:15:06,340
every banker in New York had called
wanting to finance his venture.

1179
01:15:06,919 --> 01:15:08,546
Our modern day J.P.

1180
01:15:10,489 --> 01:15:13,981
You're so brilliant. You're so brilliant.
I missed that when we split up.

1181
01:15:14,092 --> 01:15:15,684
- Oh, you.
- I miss that about you now.

1182
01:15:20,032 --> 01:15:21,522
<i>This one's an old favorite...</i>

1183
01:15:21,600 --> 01:15:22,897
<i>called Boomerang.</i>

1184
01:15:23,235 --> 01:15:25,931
<i>It's only now that I truly appreciate it.</i>

1185
01:15:37,549 --> 01:15:41,849
<i>Help me, Lord, I thought I found it</i>

1186
01:15:42,921 --> 01:15:46,948
<i>Just like a dream turned out all wrong</i>

1187
01:15:48,427 --> 01:15:52,796
<i>Don't feel the same madness about me now</i>

1188
01:15:53,865 --> 01:15:58,029
<i>Don't feel the hurting when I'm gone</i>

1189
01:15:59,538 --> 01:16:03,304
<i>It keeps coming back without you</i>

1190
01:16:05,143 --> 01:16:09,842
<i>Like a boomerang through my heart</i>

1191
01:16:10,582 --> 01:16:15,315
<i>And cursed Cupid even found me alone</i>

1192
01:16:16,221 --> 01:16:20,157
<i>Into the wound another dart</i>

1193
01:16:20,959 --> 01:16:25,259
<i>Should I never look into your eyes again</i>

1194
01:16:26,565 --> 01:16:30,558
<i>Should I never want to give my all</i>

1195
01:16:31,970 --> 01:16:36,964
<i>Should I ever need you like my only friend</i>

1196
01:16:39,111 --> 01:16:43,343
<i>Should I read the writing on the wall?</i>

1197
01:16:49,388 --> 01:16:51,185
He sounds really good tonight, huh?

1198
01:16:51,423 --> 01:16:53,186
And you look like death.

1199
01:16:59,598 --> 01:17:02,396
<i>Never to be</i>

1200
01:17:02,467 --> 01:17:07,404
<i>If only one dreamer dreams of love</i>

1201
01:17:09,775 --> 01:17:11,265
Who's the weird guy?

1202
01:17:13,812 --> 01:17:16,212
Play nice. He's your airport ride.

1203
01:17:18,083 --> 01:17:22,383
<i>Just like a dream turned out all wrong</i>

1204
01:17:23,588 --> 01:17:28,025
<i>Don't feel the same madness about me now</i>

1205
01:17:28,393 --> 01:17:33,353
<i>She loves to hear the sadness in my song</i>

1206
01:17:43,175 --> 01:17:45,643
<i>I'm very thankful for being
back here tonight.</i>

1207
01:17:47,813 --> 01:17:51,078
<i>This next one I wrote with a friend of mine
about somebody special.</i>

1208
01:17:51,450 --> 01:17:54,180
<i>She can sing it a hell of a lot better
than I can, so...</i>

1209
01:17:55,554 --> 01:17:57,215
You sure you wanna go?

1210
01:17:58,357 --> 01:18:01,121
Who else is gonna get me
through all my stuff?

1211
01:18:01,193 --> 01:18:03,252
You seem to be doing pretty well to me.

1212
01:18:03,328 --> 01:18:06,263
Yeah. It started happening when you...

1213
01:18:06,331 --> 01:18:09,129
- got me talking.
- Yeah.

1214
01:18:11,470 --> 01:18:13,768
- I'll miss you.
- I'll miss you, too.

1215
01:18:16,274 --> 01:18:18,003
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>

1216
01:18:26,351 --> 01:18:28,046
<i>Don't get too used to this.</i>

1217
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:31,650
<i>It's nice to see Luke back here tonight.</i>

1218
01:18:31,723 --> 01:18:34,749
<i>For a while there, I thought we lost him
to the dark side.</i>

1219
01:18:35,127 --> 01:18:38,858
<i>Anyways, I hope you guys like this song.
It's called Undiscovered.</i>

1220
01:18:49,608 --> 01:18:53,100
<i>Take it back, take it all back now</i>

1221
01:18:53,311 --> 01:18:55,074
<i>The things I gave</i>

1222
01:18:55,147 --> 01:18:59,641
<i>Like the taste of my kiss on your lips</i>

1223
01:19:00,652 --> 01:19:02,643
<i>I miss that now</i>

1224
01:19:06,158 --> 01:19:09,958
<i>I can't try any harder than I do</i>

1225
01:19:10,028 --> 01:19:11,962
<i>All the reasons I gave</i>

1226
01:19:12,030 --> 01:19:14,999
<i>Excuses I made for you</i>

1227
01:19:17,469 --> 01:19:19,266
<i>I'm broken in two</i>

1228
01:19:23,341 --> 01:19:27,334
<i>All the things left undiscovered</i>

1229
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:31,509
<i>Left me waiting enough to wonder</i>

1230
01:19:32,884 --> 01:19:35,250
<i>I need you</i>

1231
01:19:37,088 --> 01:19:39,579
<i>Yeah, I need you</i>

1232
01:19:40,425 --> 01:19:43,917
<i>When I'm in the dark and all alone</i>

1233
01:19:44,563 --> 01:19:48,260
<i>Dreaming that you'll walk
right through my door</i>

1234
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:53,804
<i>It's then I know my heart is whole</i>

1235
01:19:57,342 --> 01:20:01,403
<i>There's a million reasons why I cry</i>

1236
01:20:01,480 --> 01:20:05,473
<i>Pull my covers tight and close my eyes</i>

1237
01:20:05,750 --> 01:20:10,710
<i>'Cause I don't want to be alone</i>

1238
01:20:14,092 --> 01:20:18,085
<i>'Cause I can't fake and I can't hate</i>

1239
01:20:18,296 --> 01:20:22,426
<i>But it's my heart that's about to break</i>

1240
01:20:22,501 --> 01:20:26,904
<i>You're all I need, I'm on my knees</i>

1241
01:20:26,972 --> 01:20:30,931
<i>Watch me bleed
Would you listen, please?</i>

1242
01:20:31,009 --> 01:20:34,911
<i>I give in, I breathe out</i>

1243
01:20:35,146 --> 01:20:39,048
<i>I want you, there's no doubt</i>

1244
01:20:39,351 --> 01:20:43,117
<i>I freak out, I'm left out</i>

1245
01:20:43,555 --> 01:20:47,548
<i>Without you, I'm without</i>

1246
01:20:47,826 --> 01:20:51,592
<i>I'm crossed out, I'm kicked out</i>

1247
01:20:52,030 --> 01:20:56,057
<i>I cry out, I reach out</i>

1248
01:20:58,403 --> 01:21:00,997
<i>Don't walk away</i>

1249
01:21:02,541 --> 01:21:05,874
<i>Don't walk away</i>

1250
01:21:06,778 --> 01:21:09,042
<i>Don't walk away</i>

1251
01:21:10,982 --> 01:21:13,348
<i>Don't walk away</i>

1252
01:21:33,638 --> 01:21:35,629
- That was really beautiful.
- Yeah.

1253
01:21:36,741 --> 01:21:38,504
<i>Give it up for Clea.</i>

1254
01:21:41,313 --> 01:21:42,837
You're wonderful. I adore you...

1255
01:21:42,914 --> 01:21:45,041
- and I'm gonna call you.
- Thank you.

1256
01:21:48,353 --> 01:21:49,718
So he's here for her.

1257
01:21:49,788 --> 01:21:52,222
Somewhere there's a village
looking for you, you idiot.

1258
01:21:52,290 --> 01:21:54,622
That's the infamous Treadway
head fake, man.

1259
01:21:54,693 --> 01:21:56,854
- Come on. Let's go.
- Luke.

1260
01:21:57,295 --> 01:21:59,763
You were fantastic.
You gotta come and see us.

1261
01:21:59,831 --> 01:22:02,356
Hey, man, when you sang, it moved me.

1262
01:22:02,601 --> 01:22:03,932
- Seriously.
- Thanks.

1263
01:22:04,069 --> 01:22:06,037
I cried. Twice.

1264
01:22:07,005 --> 01:22:08,165
I like your shirt.

1265
01:22:08,239 --> 01:22:10,969
You and me are gonna go in the back...

1266
01:22:15,080 --> 01:22:16,445
That sounds great.

1267
01:22:16,514 --> 01:22:18,709
- I'm sure you're very good at it...
- Oh, I am.

1268
01:22:18,783 --> 01:22:22,514
And, I'm gonna pass.
But this, however, is my brother Euan...

1269
01:22:22,587 --> 01:22:24,646
and I'm sure he'd love to explore
your expertise.

1270
01:22:24,723 --> 01:22:28,625
Luke. That was amazing, man.

1271
01:22:28,693 --> 01:22:32,322
You were fantastic. I'm sorry about that
little bump in the road before.

1272
01:22:32,430 --> 01:22:34,398
- A little bump?
- It was more like road kill, right?

1273
01:22:34,466 --> 01:22:38,129
Listen, I've been thinking,
and I am going to give you another chance.

1274
01:22:38,203 --> 01:22:42,139
'Cause I think that with your talent
and your songs and my know-how...

1275
01:22:42,207 --> 01:22:45,904
that together with the right marketing
push, that we could be huge, man.

1276
01:22:45,977 --> 01:22:47,672
- We could blow up.
- You know what, Garrett?

1277
01:22:47,746 --> 01:22:50,306
You know, the only thing is,
I've been thinking about it, too.

1278
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:54,011
And you can go blow yourself up.

1279
01:22:54,619 --> 01:22:56,052
And then give me a call.

1280
01:22:56,388 --> 01:22:58,413
So that's a maybe, right?

1281
01:22:58,857 --> 01:23:02,054
- I think that went well. What do you think?
- Where's Brier?

1282
01:23:02,127 --> 01:23:03,754
She left. I'm Carrie.

1283
01:23:03,828 --> 01:23:04,920
The Carrie?

1284
01:23:04,996 --> 01:23:07,157
Nice to meet you.
Do you know where she is?

1285
01:23:07,232 --> 01:23:08,563
Airport.

1286
01:23:08,767 --> 01:23:10,667
- Picking up somebody?
- Moving.

1287
01:23:12,237 --> 01:23:14,296
- What?
- Back to New York.

1288
01:23:14,806 --> 01:23:17,001
United, 11:00.

1289
01:23:18,043 --> 01:23:20,341
I got to go get her. Thank you.

1290
01:23:22,280 --> 01:23:23,747
I need a ride.

1291
01:23:24,249 --> 01:23:25,614
What happened to your car?

1292
01:23:25,684 --> 01:23:29,450
A rude guy with a tow truck took it away.
I'll meet you out back.

1293
01:23:36,127 --> 01:23:39,563
- Thanks for the ride.
- Happy to be of service.

1294
01:23:40,165 --> 01:23:44,693
<i>Because the way we kiss
is better than any drug</i>

1295
01:23:45,170 --> 01:23:49,698
<i>Because when I'm with you,
I believe in love</i>

1296
01:23:50,208 --> 01:23:54,645
<i>'Cause you'll take chances
most people would never take</i>

1297
01:23:54,846 --> 01:23:56,541
- She really digs you, you know.
- Yeah?

1298
01:23:56,614 --> 01:23:58,013
- Yeah.
- Huh?

1299
01:23:58,083 --> 01:24:01,849
Is that why she's not picking up her phone
while she's moving 3,000 miles away?

1300
01:24:02,554 --> 01:24:04,317
Why don't you just go with her?

1301
01:24:05,190 --> 01:24:06,817
Why would I do that?

1302
01:24:07,525 --> 01:24:11,256
A better question is,
why the hell wouldn't you do that?

1303
01:24:11,329 --> 01:24:14,389
<i>... found someone as crazy as myself</i>

1304
01:24:14,466 --> 01:24:18,027
<i>No matter what I've done,
you always come when I cry</i>

1305
01:24:18,136 --> 01:24:19,398
Here we are.

1306
01:24:19,471 --> 01:24:23,498
<i>Yeah, that's why I love you</i>

1307
01:24:25,744 --> 01:24:29,612
<i>And that's why I love you</i>

1308
01:24:30,682 --> 01:24:33,242
<i>There's no one in this world</i>

1309
01:24:33,318 --> 01:24:35,081
Good evening, Mr. Treadway.

1310
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:37,178
- I'm Dirk.
- Yes. Of course you are.

1311
01:24:37,255 --> 01:24:39,723
I'll take your bags upstairs for you.
Here's your boarding pass.

1312
01:24:39,791 --> 01:24:41,088
Very good.

1313
01:24:41,192 --> 01:24:44,753
And if you'll come with me, sir,
through the VIP Express.

1314
01:24:49,667 --> 01:24:50,895
Pull in. Pull in.

1315
01:24:53,538 --> 01:24:55,506
Let me say once again
what an honor it's been.

1316
01:24:55,573 --> 01:24:58,633
Brier, why don't you go ahead and board?
I gotta make some phone calls.

1317
01:25:01,246 --> 01:25:04,374
- Can you wait for me?
- Yeah, yeah. Hurry up, man. I got plans.

1318
01:25:08,253 --> 01:25:11,245
Can you tell me what gate
the 11:00 flight to New York leaves from?

1319
01:25:11,322 --> 01:25:15,554
I'm sorry, sir, but only ticketed
passengers are allowed to go to the gate.

1320
01:25:18,429 --> 01:25:20,021
Well, how much is the ticket?

1321
01:25:20,098 --> 01:25:22,589
- Coach or first class?
- What do you think?

1322
01:25:22,667 --> 01:25:27,502
One fully refundable coach ticket
is $1,100.19.

1323
01:25:28,973 --> 01:25:30,338
Euan!

1324
01:25:30,708 --> 01:25:31,732
Euan.

1325
01:25:31,810 --> 01:25:34,142
- I need to borrow your credit card.
- Why?

1326
01:25:34,212 --> 01:25:35,304
I need to buy a plane ticket.

1327
01:25:35,380 --> 01:25:36,847
That's killer, man.
You're gonna go with her.

1328
01:25:36,915 --> 01:25:38,109
Please give me the card.

1329
01:25:38,183 --> 01:25:42,313
Yeah, but I don't think they're gonna take
my Blockbuster card, man, that's all I got.

1330
01:25:42,520 --> 01:25:43,544
Oh.

1331
01:25:43,621 --> 01:25:44,986
How much is it? How much is the ticket?

1332
01:25:45,056 --> 01:25:47,149
$1,100.19.

1333
01:25:47,258 --> 01:25:50,250
- I thought you were gonna say, like, $200.
- I know, Euan, I know. It's...

1334
01:25:50,328 --> 01:25:51,522
Look...

1335
01:25:52,564 --> 01:25:54,191
I can't believe I am doing this.

1336
01:25:54,332 --> 01:25:56,095
Where the hell did you get that?

1337
01:25:56,568 --> 01:25:57,762
I told you I made some money.

1338
01:25:57,836 --> 01:26:00,134
- Just take it.
- And you keep it in your pants?

1339
01:26:00,271 --> 01:26:02,762
Where else am I gonna keep it? The bank?

1340
01:26:03,408 --> 01:26:06,639
- You are not well. I love you. Thank you.
- Get outta here.

1341
01:26:06,744 --> 01:26:09,110
- Hey, hey. Take this.
- Well, what is this?

1342
01:26:09,180 --> 01:26:11,944
It's dinner. They charge you
for food on the planes now.

1343
01:26:12,016 --> 01:26:13,210
Thank you.

1344
01:26:17,589 --> 01:26:19,022
What'd you do, rob a bank?

1345
01:26:19,090 --> 01:26:21,524
Sunglass stand.
Can I have a ticket, please?

1346
01:26:21,659 --> 01:26:23,490
The flight's delayed.
You may actually make it.

1347
01:26:23,561 --> 01:26:25,995
- Thank you.
- Good luck.

1348

<i>Any remaining passengers,
please proceed to Gate 77...</i>

1350
01:26:32,570 --> 01:26:36,028
<i>for immediate boarding
as this flight is now closed.</i>

1351
01:26:52,490 --> 01:26:54,515
- Mr. Falcon?
- Yeah.

1352
01:26:54,592 --> 01:26:56,924
- May we have a word with you, please?
- Oh, come on.

1353
01:26:56,995 --> 01:26:59,293
Why did you pay cash
for your airline ticket?

1354
01:26:59,497 --> 01:27:00,964
My credit card's maxed out.

1355
01:27:01,032 --> 01:27:03,523
And do you usually carry that much
cash on your person?

1356
01:27:03,601 --> 01:27:05,501
Oh, come on! Do I look like a terrorist?

1357
01:27:05,570 --> 01:27:07,401
- Yes, a little.
- Hello, Luke.

1358
01:27:09,173 --> 01:27:10,197
Hi.

1359
01:27:10,275 --> 01:27:11,640
Is this a friend of yours?

1360
01:27:11,709 --> 01:27:15,076
Well, as a matter of fact, I caught
Luke's show in the city tonight.

1361
01:27:15,146 --> 01:27:17,910
- You're a musician, then?
- That's right. He's a musician.

1362
01:27:17,982 --> 01:27:20,041
Kind of like that Cat Stevens person.

1363
01:27:20,118 --> 01:27:22,313
- Thanks, Dirk.
- Sure.

1364
01:27:27,091 --> 01:27:29,025
Dude, do I know you?

1365
01:27:29,093 --> 01:27:31,084
Just consider me a fan.

1366
01:27:32,196 --> 01:27:34,960
- Thanks for your help.
- Swinging.

1367
01:27:35,033 --> 01:27:36,830
Would you gentlemen
please find your seats?

1368
01:27:36,901 --> 01:27:38,198
Yes, thank you.

1369
01:27:38,303 --> 01:27:40,897
- I'll help you.
- Thank you. Very kind of you.

1370
01:27:45,276 --> 01:27:48,040
I love life's little adventures.

1371
01:27:48,813 --> 01:27:50,075
Don't you?

1372
01:27:53,384 --> 01:27:55,011
Sorry. I'm sorry.

1373
01:27:56,721 --> 01:27:57,847
Sorry.

1374
01:28:02,393 --> 01:28:03,690
Sorry. Yeah.

1375
01:28:30,888 --> 01:28:33,288
So you never told him you were leaving?

1376
01:28:33,458 --> 01:28:35,289
It would've been too sad.

1377
01:28:37,428 --> 01:28:39,419
He's a damn good songwriter.

1378
01:28:40,131 --> 01:28:42,463
Is that the good news or the bad news?

1379
01:28:42,533 --> 01:28:44,626
Maybe one, maybe both.

1380
01:28:45,136 --> 01:28:46,364
Maybe neither.

1381
01:28:51,609 --> 01:28:54,737
So sorry, but he made me promise
to deliver it that way to you.

1382
01:29:00,018 --> 01:29:02,851
I think you have a second chance
to say goodbye.

1383
01:29:17,668 --> 01:29:18,896
I'm sorry.

1384
01:29:21,606 --> 01:29:22,698
Sorry.

1385
01:29:24,375 --> 01:29:25,467
Hi.

1386
01:29:26,611 --> 01:29:28,044
I heard you tonight.

1387
01:29:28,146 --> 01:29:30,011
You left without saying goodbye.

1388
01:29:30,448 --> 01:29:32,279
It just got to be too much.

1389
01:29:33,718 --> 01:29:35,015
Excuse me.

1390
01:29:35,086 --> 01:29:36,075
I...

1391
01:29:36,387 --> 01:29:39,948
- I never meant to hurt you.
- Yeah.

1392
01:29:43,194 --> 01:29:45,059
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

1393
01:29:46,330 --> 01:29:48,696
- L...
- No. Me first, okay?

1394
01:29:49,367 --> 01:29:50,356
I...

1395
01:29:51,369 --> 01:29:54,304
I love you. I do. But I just...
I can't...

1396
01:29:54,739 --> 01:29:57,708
- I can't deal with the groupies and the...
- Brier.

1397
01:29:57,775 --> 01:30:00,209
...touring and, you know...

1398
01:30:01,579 --> 01:30:03,410
I'm just a songwriter.

1399
01:30:05,416 --> 01:30:07,247
I'm happy writing songs.

1400
01:30:07,485 --> 01:30:08,509
And...

1401
01:30:08,586 --> 01:30:10,986
And playing The Mint on Monday nights.

1402
01:30:11,789 --> 01:30:13,484
But I'd give that up if...

1403
01:30:17,328 --> 01:30:18,693
I love you.

1404
01:30:19,964 --> 01:30:22,262
From the first moment I saw you.

1405
01:30:23,468 --> 01:30:25,299
- Hi.
- Hello.

1406
01:30:25,870 --> 01:30:28,896
This is not the Wizard of Oz.
This is actually Wick Treadway.

1407
01:30:29,040 --> 01:30:30,837
- Luke Falcon.
- Pink Sands.

1408
01:30:30,908 --> 01:30:32,808
I didn't mean to eavesdrop or...

1409
01:30:32,877 --> 01:30:35,368
I mean, actually, I did mean to eavesdrop,
but I just thought...

1410
01:30:35,446 --> 01:30:38,574
I could throw a little something-something
into this Apache dance here.

1411
01:30:39,150 --> 01:30:40,242
Listen, Luke...

1412
01:30:40,418 --> 01:30:44,878
at this particular moment in time, I only
have room for one new act on my roster...

1413
01:30:45,156 --> 01:30:47,522
And that little deal was contingent
upon seeing the artist...

1414
01:30:47,592 --> 01:30:50,220
live last night, and she was brilliant.

1415
01:30:50,294 --> 01:30:52,956
With your help, as I understand.
Which leads me to you.

1416
01:30:53,030 --> 01:30:57,660
Now unless I'm wrong, you're gonna enjoy
a very long ride in this business...

1417
01:30:57,902 --> 01:31:02,362
if you get down on the reality that
the only solid business in music...

1418
01:31:02,440 --> 01:31:03,737
isn't performing.

1419
01:31:03,808 --> 01:31:05,366
It's publishing.

1420
01:31:05,476 --> 01:31:06,568
What does that mean?

1421
01:31:06,644 --> 01:31:09,909
It means Erna Mansen.
It means Patsy Netbruse.

1422
01:31:09,981 --> 01:31:11,744
- It means Bart Howard.
- Who?

1423
01:31:11,816 --> 01:31:14,910
You don't know their names, but you know
their music. You know their words.

1424
01:31:14,986 --> 01:31:17,147
You been listening to their songs
a hundred times a day...

1425
01:31:17,221 --> 01:31:19,348
people listening to them
from New York to Beijing.

1426
01:31:19,423 --> 01:31:21,414
- I like that.
- I knew you would.

1427
01:31:21,492 --> 01:31:23,892
Dig it. Hemingway had it right.

1428
01:31:24,262 --> 01:31:25,991
Fame is a bitch goddess.

1429
01:31:26,063 --> 01:31:27,724
Fame is fraud, man.

1430
01:31:27,798 --> 01:31:29,766
Fame is nothing. It's foam.

1431
01:31:29,834 --> 01:31:31,768
Fame will break your heart, brother.

1432
01:31:31,836 --> 01:31:35,203
But creativity, listen up, is passion.

1433
01:31:35,273 --> 01:31:36,763
And it's endless.

1434
01:31:36,841 --> 01:31:39,332
You look for fame, you'll lose your soul.

1435
01:31:39,544 --> 01:31:42,513
You look for creation, you'll find it.

1436
01:31:43,548 --> 01:31:44,742
So listen up.

1437
01:31:44,815 --> 01:31:45,941
If you're interested...

1438
01:31:46,017 --> 01:31:49,009
you wanna continue this little conversation
about publishing deals...

1439
01:31:49,086 --> 01:31:51,884
maybe we'll talk in Jamaica.

1440
01:31:52,056 --> 01:31:53,580
If you're invited.

1441
01:31:53,691 --> 01:31:55,750
Wait. How did you know
I was going to Jamaica?

1442
01:31:55,893 --> 01:31:59,920
You're going to Jamaica to do a video with
an old reggae group that I am reinventing.

1443
01:31:59,997 --> 01:32:01,521
You're the client.

1444
01:32:02,066 --> 01:32:04,694
If you want an extra ticket, let me know.
Bye.

1445
01:32:05,770 --> 01:32:07,067
Thank you.

1446
01:32:08,706 --> 01:32:10,674
Do you wanna go away with me?

1447
01:32:11,409 --> 01:32:14,207
- Under one condition.
- Oh, yeah? What's that?

1448
01:32:14,712 --> 01:32:16,976
That you're with me and only me.

1449
01:32:18,649 --> 01:32:20,241
Where would we live?

1450
01:32:24,088 --> 01:32:27,649
Anywhere you want.
I can write from anywhere.

1451
01:32:52,850 --> 01:32:56,411
Hello, little brother.
Or should I say, "Hello, Rastaman"?

1452
01:32:56,487 --> 01:33:00,082
<i>Yeah, hardly. Yeah, you need to see
what I'm letting her do to me. Hold on.</i>

1453
01:33:04,595 --> 01:33:07,758
A new do, huh? I think it's about time.

1454
01:33:07,865 --> 01:33:09,059
<i>Hey, how's the pup?</i>

1455
01:33:09,133 --> 01:33:11,294
The world's greatest chick magnet.

1456
01:33:12,069 --> 01:33:13,366
He's doing what he does best.

1457
01:33:13,437 --> 01:33:14,768
- Is that your dog?
- Yeah.

1458
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:16,704
- He's so cute!
- Thank you.

1459
01:33:18,643 --> 01:33:20,474
You're not getting this dog back.

1460
01:33:25,716 --> 01:33:27,308
<i>My plan is to have him surfing...</i>

1461
01:33:27,385 --> 01:33:28,443
next time you come out here.

1462
01:33:28,519 --> 01:33:30,384
Yeah, I don't doubt that, man.

1463
01:33:30,655 --> 01:33:32,885
Hey, listen, I'll talk
to you soon, all right?

1464
01:33:32,957 --> 01:33:35,983
Listen, little brother. You gotta
start writing us some songs, okay?

1465
01:33:36,060 --> 01:33:38,620
The band signed a little record contract...

1466
01:33:38,696 --> 01:33:40,220
and we're not doing covers anymore.

1467
01:33:40,298 --> 01:33:41,890
<i>- I'll see what I can do.
- All right, bye.</i>
