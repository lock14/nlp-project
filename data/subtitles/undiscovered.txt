Hey, red coat.
- Yeah, I'm on it.
- God, she's gorgeous.
- What do you think, ballerina?
- No, I think she is a model, brother.
- How can you tell?
- Because I can just tell by looking at her.
Hey! You dropped your glove.
Next time you pull
a stunt like that, Casanova...
make sure it's not with a pair of gloves
that I lent you.
I know, I'm sorry. But did you see
the connection we made back there?
I mean, look at me. I'm smitten.
"Smitten"?
You don't look any different.
And who says "smitten" anyway?
No, I know, but I've been here six months
and I meet no one.
And then the day I leave, the prettiest
girl I've ever seen smiles at me.
- I don't even know what her name...
- So don't go to LA.
All right.
- Stay here, look for her.
- I can't. You know that.
This is doing nothing for me musically.
I need to go to California to get heard,
you know that. But come with me.
- You can.
- No, no, no.
I think I need to play
a few street corners first.
See Amsterdam, see Paris.
Besides, I think one sellout
in the family is just plenty.
Eat me.
And on that brotherly note...
take care of yourself, Luke.
You're late. Come on, get out of here.
- Oh, hey.
- Yeah?
This is our last day in New York together.
Watch it. Remember me.
I will.
And, hey, the girl of your dreams is on it.
Be zen, brother.
- Hey, Jenn. It's Brier. Is Carrie in?
- Hold on.
- Thanks.
- It's your niece on two.
Hey, Friar Brier.
- Hi.
- Now don't talk with your mouth full.
And you're eating crap, aren't you?
Hate to disappoint you, Carrie...
but actually, I'm eating
a very heart-healthy tofu wrap.
Oh, you're a very smart
and a very cute girl...
but you're a terrible liar.
- How did it go with the catalog people?
- Good, good. It was great.
Carrie...
do you believe in destiny
or do you think everything's just random?
Why? What happened?
The hottest guy just did the coolest thing.
And?
And I know I'm never going to
see him again.
Well, thank God for small miracles.
You okay?
Yeah, I just...
I don't know.
It's the first year that...
Mom's not around to talk to me
about this stuff.
I know. I miss her too, kiddo.
We're sorry.
Your call cannot...
Try your call again.
- Park Hyatt.
- Hello, can you please connect me...
to Mick Benson's room?
Mr. Benson is not a guest at this hotel.
Perhaps you are looking for another name?
No, Rotten. Try Johnny Rotten.
Mr. Rotten. Very handsome man.
- Arigato.
- Connecting you.
$38, $39.
It pays for one of my parking tickets.
Sorry I'm late, baby.
I missed you so much.
You're not upset, are you? Okay.
So when one of my models
wants to go to lunch for a talk...
- it can only be one of the big eight.
- "Big eight"?
Drugs, bulimia, anorexia, "I'm broke"...
"I'm pregnant", "I'm gay"...
"I slept with Vince Vaughn
and he never called me again.' '
He never called me either.
- Okay. That's only seven.
- Right.
You tell me your thing
and then we'll see if I'm right.
Okay.
- I want to move to Los Angeles.
- And?
And I want to try acting.
"Model turned actress. LA.' '
Ouch.
I win.
- How'd you know?
- I'm in the business of knowing things.
And look, I understand.
- Now, how's your little rock star?
- Mick and I are fine.
Yeah, you're fine.
- So you guys are talking a lot, are you?
- Not a lot, you know. He's on tour, so...
Actually, I think his assistant
has been answering my e-mails.
That's so romantic.
I know in my head it's wrong,
but my heart can't let it go.
Dude, that is so rad.
- You got to get that dog on Letterman.
- Actually, we got our eye on the X Games.
Car service will be waiting for you
at the bottom of the escalators.
Use plenty of sun block.
Stay off the 405 whenever possible.
Are you getting any of this?
These are pearls of wisdom here.
Yeah, yeah. I'm just a little overwhelmed.
But, I'll be okay.
It's just for a couple of months.
Thank you so much, Carrie.
You, you never said there was anything
Hey, why don't you wrap it up?
We've heard enough of this song!
Excuse me?
I know what I'm talking about.
This is not a good song.
You suck!
Now, ladies and gentlemen, it's okay.
It's okay.
I think I recognize his voice.
Can we get a spot on him?
My little brother tells
me he's a rock star.
Hey, little brother.
- So you've been around the world twice?
- Yeah. Both ways.
And you enjoy this?
Dude, you're kidding me, right?
Going to St. Petersburg next month to play
in the St. Petersburg Folk Festival.
- I'm playing the flute.
- That's cool.
I just have to learn
how to play the flute...
but I have a month to accomplish this.
What about you? Why aren't you playing
the sold-out giganto dome?
Didn't you promise me that?
Well, you'd be surprised how many people
would kill for this gig.
I'm not surprised. I'm
not surprised at all.
Look, and thanks for letting me
crash at your place.
I mean, two years is way too long.
Let's do one for the old man.
Who wasn't nearly old enough.
Yeah, not even close.
I will be correspondent to command...
and do my spiriting gently.
Do so. And after two days,
I will discharge thee.
That's my noble master.
What shall I do? Say what?
What shall I do?
Okay, not bad, not bad.
Better than television.
But what isn't? Okay, everybody.
15 minutes. Let's go.
Come on, 15 minutes. Go. Go, go.
Brier.
Actors, I'm not sure you've all been
formally introduced to Brier.
- Brier, actors. Actors, Brier.
- Hi, Brier.
I'm Clea.
This is Jason, LeShea, and Michelle.
- Hi.
- Shot in the dark.
You're a New York model, right?
Yeah, I am a model,
but I'm originally from Nebraska.
Don't tell me, ever since you were
a little girl on the farm...
it's always been your dream
to become an actress.
Wow.
Dancer, actually, but it didn't work out.
Look, do you have a problem with me?
Because as fun as it is being reduced
to a stereotype...
I think I'd rather eat that
stack of headshots in your arms...
which incidentally look like
they were taken about 10 years ago.
Brier, wait. She didn't mean it.
Please don't tell me that other actors...
are as mean and bitchy to each other
as models.
Welcome to LA.
Great.
Forget 15 minutes.
I lied. Come on, back in.
Come on, you can sit with me.
And don't worry.
She'll be a lot nicer after a few drinks.
Actors, actors, actors.
- What's up, man?
- What's up, shorty? Watch the shoes.
Sure, sure, dude.
Your little fingers on my spine
And when I open up my eyes
I want to see your face
This guy right here,
he sings from his heart.
I want to throw up.
His work defies classification.
But if I had to take a shot...
I'd say he's like Jeff Buckley
crossed with Elvis Costello.
Yeah, I recognize him.
- MTV, right?
- MTV?
- Does Luke look like a rapper to you?
- Yeah, you're right.
- He is cool, though.
- Luke has integrity.
He wants to make it, but on his own terms.
So, have you gone out?
That's kind of complicated.
He's like a brother to me.
Why don't you play Smart in a Stupid Way?
All right, Smart in a Stupid Way it is,
but I need a little help.
Get Clea up onstage. Get her up there.
Is the sexiest singer in LA
in the house tonight?
She had eyes like crazy diamonds
And you ran with feet of clay
They rolled the windows
tight as they would go
It was a smoggy day
She looked up and asked me
If I ever had a lover
That I did not betray
Did not betray
And I turned on the radio
The radio
And I looked the other way
She said, "You're smart,
but in a stupid way"
And this is this is the price that he pays
For being smart in a stupid way
You stand there staring
while your lover walks away
- She's tight, man.
- Look. Hey.
Screw him. Look, we're talking
about our boys here, the Rounders.
- Grounded.
- Grounded. Now look.
We're gonna do four songs. No encores.
You're gonna leave them wanting more.
In order:
- Up to Me, Internal Spike.
- Strike.
- Internal Strike, Car Ride.
- You got it.
- Which version?
- The short one. What's wrong with you?
The train just pulled away
Sometimes I smell the perfume
Any of you guys know the name
of that chick over there?
No.
- Is that your friend?
- I don't think so.
He's just another record company jackass.
I think his name's Garrett Schweck.
- Pretend he's not here.
- Okay.
Maybe I'll grow up
And be good someday
Maybe this pain I feel will go away
And this is the price that you pay
For being smart in a stupid way
You stand there staring
while your lover walks away
Being smart
In a stupid way
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm going to take a break.
I do have an announcement.
I misplaced a pair of gloves a while back,
if anybody's seen them.
- Oh, my God, you were fantastic.
- Thank you.
My old office. I'm no longer there.
I recognized you.
You figured it out.
Yeah. I thought for a second
that you were my third grade boyfriend.
- So you're disappointed?
- No.
I'm a Taurus. He was a bed-wetter.
It would never have worked out.
But you look different,
like manly and like...
- bigger and more manlier.
- Brier, you're babbling.
More grown-up.
- I'm Luke.
- Brier.
Sit.
This is my brother Euan.
His views do not reflect my own
or my family's in any way.
I'm just going to throw it out
right on the table, right now.
Naked folk singing.
- But I didn't hear a no.
- Okay, kids. Next stop, L.A. Burger.
You grab your brother, we're out of here.
Wait. So you just threw your glove at her?
No. No, no. It was way more
romantic than that. Sweet.
I must have looked for you on that train
for over a year.
And now here he is.
So, what's up with the music career,
rock star? The new tracks are hot.
Yeah, you sounded really good tonight.
Thanks. Same crap, different day.
No, all the A&R guys are like Garrett.
They're interested at first but...
you know, then it's, like,
"Well, why didn't anyone else sign him?"
It must be really hard.
Well, some days, but...
Hey...
you get to play live for people.
I'd do it for free.
- You pretty much do, brother.
- Yeah, good point.
Yeah, good point.
- Look at the time.
- I've got to go. I got a callback tomorrow.
- Showoff.
- Yeah, for a deodorant commercial.
- It's going to make me a star.
- Yes.
Bye. It's nice meeting you. Again, right?
- Bye.
- Yeah, bye.
- Well?
- What?
You're letting her get away, jackass. Go.
Go get her. Go.
- Brier?
- Hi.
I never got the chance to...
I had a question.
Can I call you sometime?
Can I take that grunt as a yes?
You're really sweet.
"Sweet" as in sweet, or "sweet" as in...
a busboy giving you a hug
on your birthday?
What?
Sorry, that made sense in my head.
No, you're really nice
and you're really talented and...
handsome. I just...
- There's just...
- But, you have a boyfriend.
Kind of.
- "Kind of"?
- Yes.
Why do you say "kind of"?
It's a little mixed up right now...
and I promised myself
as well as my best friend that...
I wouldn't get involved
with another musician, so...
Understand, all right?
No.
I'm sorry.
Hey. Brier, I'm so glad I caught you.
I'm about four mojitos over the limit.
- Can I grab a ride?
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you, Brier.
- See you later, okay?
All right.
- Dude, are you doing it again?
- What?
Just watching her go away?
- Want to talk about it?
- Talk about what?
Why you're being an idiot.
This perfectly amazing, talented...
beautiful guy reappears magically
in your life...
Yeah, and I have a boyfriend.
You mean the 40-year-old rock star
who cheats on you...
and hasn't called you in a month?
Break me off a piece of that.
I don't know how to get over him.
I don't think you fall out of love
until you fall into someone else.
Trading one musician for another?
Plus, even if he doesn't make it,
Luke's still going to be miserable.
And when he becomes successful
and goes on tour...
- you'll lose him to the road.
- Yeah, exactly.
Look, Luke's amazing, but...
But what?
You don't think he's gonna make it?
I asked him once why he kept at it.
He just laughed.
He said it was the only way he could
thank his dad for the piano lessons.
- That's such a line.
- I know.
Funny thing, though. He meant it.
Listen, if I had the cash,
I would pay for his record myself.
Wait. Why don't we do something for him?
What? Like become his first two groupies?
Because I would be totally,
totally down with that.
No, no, no. I'm talking about...
We could create a total buzz about him.
You know how that Garrett guy
totally worked the room?
We could do that, easy.
- He is talented.
- Yeah, he's talented.
We could totally do it.
We could get the internet, images, buzz.
Don't you think that's a little bit sneaky?
Yeah, it's sneaky,
but it's totally for a good cause.
I'm not going to lie to you, kiddo.
Your plan's blatantly manipulative
and sneaky...
not to mention ethically questionable.
I am so in.
The thing is, the guy deserves it.
I mean, he's a really good guy.
Does this mean we're getting rid of the...
womanizing, grunge-era relic?
Sorry, Carrie. Luke's just a friend.
So you have a girl or not?
Jenn, who do we have
working on the coast?
Hold on. Here it is.
A really beautiful,
all natural Brazilian...
or maybe not so natural.
Josie, thank you so much.
No problem. I like musicians.
- So, is he cute?
- Let's get this clear.
He doesn't look like
one of the Calvin Klein men.
- They're not men, they're boys.
- What does that mean?
I think it's a language thing.
But why don't we get going
because I think we're going to be late.
- How long have you been here?
- I arrived an hour ago, about.
No. I mean, in this country.
- Which country?
- A language thing?
- What's Brazilian for "moron"?
- Let's just be nice.
Okay.
Baby, I can see it even with the light out
Baby, I can see it even with the light out
- You're fabulous.
- Thanks, do I know you?
Perhaps you saw a commercial.
ColorSoft shampoo.
"Hair, like I made it, but way better.' '
- Sorry, doesn't ring a bell.
- No matter, sexy guy.
Here you go. Will you take a picture
for me and my family in Brazil?
Sure, sure.
You got him, Richard.
And since I'm giving Page 6
this exclusive...
this layout better be splashy.
You were good
Oh, you see
Come with me
Try and understand.
I have friends blogging the world.
You should see the websites popping up.
Luke even has his own chat room.
Every little bit helps.
Who's that one over there?
Holy cow!
This might be working.
- Who'd you get, actresses?
- Not reliable enough.
- Strippers.
- Did you just say "Holy cow"?
- You can take the girl off the farm...
- Oh, shut up.
Hey, hey. There's Garrett. Go get him.
Cool deal.
Jason, you're on.
That's not me
I am strong and so are you
Don't know what to do
You're a pure example
Just a pure example
Looks like your boy's got his mojo back.
You should have signed him
when you had the chance.
And who says I still can't?
I don't know.
Maybe my friend here from Elektra Records.
Elektra?
Wow.
I know a bunch of cats down at your label,
but I don't believe we've met.
- Garrett Schweck, Tantra.
- Don't know it.
Bond. Jason Bond. A&R, London.
Well, Bond, you're a long way from home,
aren't you?
Then I damn well better not go home
empty-handed, had I?
Why don't I give you something
to bring back home with you?
- That could be arranged.
- Come with me, Mr. Bond.
I would love for you to charm me
with your dirty English banter.
- Cheers.
- Cheerio, Bond.
- Kick some British ass.
- Indeed, sir.
- Hold me back.
- Nice touch on the accent.
Improv, Daddy-O!
The fire in your eyes
Can I have your number?
Should a single summer
Put fire in your eyes
What would you say if I offer you
a safer place?
You're a pure example
- He's really not that bad, this kid.
- He's awesome.
So, I can...
barely get a seat
at one of your shows anymore.
I know it's crazy. It just...
I don't know what I'm doing differently.
I guess it's just a timing thing.
- You know, right songs, right crowd.
- Yeah, that must be it.
Oh, by the way, the guy
from Tantra's coming back next week.
- Great.
- Yeah, it could be.
He said he's trying
to make an artist-friendly label...
- kind of like Pink Sands used to be.
- What's Pink Sands?
It's just this old, cool label.
It was started by this guy
named Wick Treadway.
Where is he now?
Apparently, it's break time.
- You want to sit?
- Sure.
Come on, pup.
Yeah.
So last I heard, he was starting some
eco-resort in the Caribbean or something.
- Cool.
- Yeah.
So, are you coming Monday night?
- Depends.
- On what?
If Clea and I are on the list.
Clea and you.
You know, I've been meaning to ask you
about that. Are you guys...
You know...
What?
Of course. Because I
don't want to date you, I'm gay, right?
- No, that's not what I...
- I see.
Yeah. It occurred to me.
You're getting used to every girl
throwing themselves at you.
- Not every girl's gonna be like that.
- I know. It's just...
When are we going to break out
of the friend zone?
- I'm involved.
- I know you say that, but...
why haven't I seen him? Why haven't you?
Why don't you ever talk about him?
It doesn't make any sense.
Because...
I don't know why.
Thank you.
- Will you sign this?
- Sure.
Nice touch.
I wish I would have thought of it.
- Can I buy a round of drinks for the table?
- Which one?
What the hell. All of them.
How about just my six up front,
Daddy Warbucks?
- All right, you got it.
- Thank you.
Hi, sexy guy.
Josie.
Long time no see, boo.
- Did he just call her "boo"?
- Yeah.
Who does he think he is, Ludacris?
Come on, sweetheart. Don't be silly.
You and I both know that she's in LA.
- I'm just going to invite her to my show.
- That's great, Mick.
But I'm the middle of
a triple witching hour...
and I'm not giving you her number...
nor am I going to confirm
whether or not she's in LA.
Nice try, though, love.
Talentless ass.
What was that?
- Sorry, I thought I hung up.
- No, you didn't.
Damn it.
Hello?
Hello?
Well, that got rid of
you. Chauvinist creep.
No, you didn't, baby.
There you go.
You sure left in a hurry the other night.
Yeah, I thought I was coming down
with something.
Brazilian flu?
- Not funny.
- Kind of funny.
Why don't you just admit that you like him?
Why would I do something like that?
Because it's true. I mean, come on. It's
not like the guy's not interested in you.
It's complicated.
- Good job.
- Et tu, Brute.
- Does that mean it's my turn?
- Oh, yes.
Watch out here.
You know, it's okay to admit
if you're scared.
Excuse me? I'm not scared.
Anyways, how would you know?
Obviously, you've never had
your heart broken before.
Swing.
Brier, just be honest with yourself.
You are scared.
- And you're totally hiding behind Mick.
- Mick's my boyfriend.
Yeah, kind of like the boyfriend
I told Harley Sasser about.
Who's Harley Sasser?
He was my boyfriend at camp
when I was 14.
He was so hot, every Thursday night...
we'd sneak out and make out
behind the craft shop.
The problem was, as summer went on,
he started wanting more.
- More?
- You know, more.
Oh.
Anyway, one week I decided I was sick
of the groping.
So, I confessed to Harley that I had a
boyfriend back in LA named Tony Savatsky.
I told him I felt really guilty
and that was the end of Harley and I.
Okay, I get it.
You made up the other guy so you didn't
have to get felt up anymore.
Oh, no.
Tony Savatsky was real. He just
hadn't been my boyfriend in eight months.
Not to rush you, Luke, but could you just
sign the damn contract?
How is that not rushing me?
You're right. I'm sorry.
Look, I wouldn't be on edge like this...
if I and everyone else at Tantra didn't
have such a gigantic hard-on for you, kid.
And I don't get hard for just anyone.
- Thanks.
- Tantra is where you belong.
It's where you'll get rich.
It's where you'll be heard.
Look. Check this out.
This guy, last year, he was living
in the streets, a meth addict.
She was teaching gym in South Central.
These jackasses were playing proms
in Pacoima.
You know what they all have in common?
- What?
- Me.
I broke them. Every last one of them.
And I'm going to do the same for you.
Where is Pacoima?
You can dick around with
your major labels all you want, Luke...
but you got to trust me.
- The key is to strike when the iron is hot.
- He's right, baby.
Think about it.
Help me here, Josie.
- Hello.
- Hey. Brier, come in.
- Hi.
- I didn't know you had people here.
They were discussing business
and Garrett has a little problem.
- Clearly this is a weird time.
- Not at all.
I'm just trying to give the guy
a bag full of money.
Forget them. Coming to the show tonight?
I'm not sure but I'm
definitely going to try.
Please?
Okay.
All right, take care.
- Okay.
- Bye-bye.
So long.
Luke?
Luke.
Let's hop to it.
That's great.
More to your left.
Perfect.
I called her and I was like,
"Yeah, he's been out.' '
You don't understand. It's not gonna work.
- Sir, this is a closed set.
- I'm a good friend of Brier's.
Oh, sure you are, yeah. Got to go.
If you'd just let me by,
that'd be excellent. Thank you.
- Security.
- Hi.
Luke, what are you doing here?
I just wanted you to be the first
to know that I did it.
What?
I signed a contract. I'm with Tantra.
Oh.
I know, I'm still in shock.
God, I've been doing it for so long.
It just happened so fast.
That's really great.
Can you give us two minutes?
Sure, no problem.
Anyway...
I just wanted to thank you.
We both know how big a part
you played in all this.
- Me?
- Yes.
You've been so supportive
and such a good friend and you inspire me.
I do?
There you go.
- You know what?
- What?
- We should celebrate.
- We should.
Yes, yes. We should go celebrate at this...
really celebratory place
that I think you would really like.
- I mean, I love it.
- Okay.
We have, like, 10 more minutes,
one more shot, and then we can meet.
- She'll show you where to sit, okay?
- Perfect.
Hi.
What would you have said
if you had seen me again?
I would have said that you were
the most beautiful girl in the world.
You?
I would have said probably the same thing
I would have said today, but then.
- Which is?
- "Why don't you have a girlfriend?"
Yeah.
Well, I'm pretty much
a skeptical serial monogamist.
Why is that?
When I figured out that the closer I got
to making it...
the more women seemed to materialize
out of the vapor.
And when the deals disappeared...
so did they, so...
We're not all like that.
You know, I've been in LA for two years
and I didn't know there was a subway.
We need a longer cable.
- I was kind of picturing a bar or something.
- A bar?
You play in a bar every night.
That's boring. This is special.
Yeah, yeah. Not in this lifetime.
What's the big deal? There's a net.
- Yeah, right.
- Right, you watching?
- Yep.
- Here goes.
Come on, give it a try.
Yeah, sorry.
My record contract has a "no dying" clause.
Are you being a wuss?
Yay.
You okay?
- You want help up?
- Yeah. Thank you.
Okay. Come here.
You okay?
This place sucks.
I have something for you.
This is from the other night.
It's kind of a rough mix, but...
My God, thank you.
Everything's happened
since you showed up, Brier...
and everything's happening...
And I want you to be my girlfriend.
Come on the road with me.
We'll see the country together.
- I'm sorry.
- That's okay.
I'm sorry.
- What's up, party girl?
- Turn on the radio.
- Howard Stern.
- You know I don't listen to him.
Crap, it's ending.
It's that fake Brazilian chick.
She's going on and on about Luke.
You'd think that they were an item.
- She wouldn't shut up.
- I'm sorry I missed that.
I got to scoot.
I'll call you later though, okay?
All right, bye.
I can't.
- I can't do this.
- What?
Rock stars can't have girlfriends,
not real ones.
- But I'm not a rock star. I'm a musician.
- Yeah, but you know what?
You signed a contract,
and it's not a question of "if.' '
It's a question of "when.' '
How do you know that?
How can you say that?
How could you even...
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry about everything,
especially last night.
I shouldn't have let it happen.
Wait. Brier?
Hey!
Come back!
What happened?
Stay with me a while
And gently break me with your smile
Good.
Very good.
- You thought it was good?
- Yeah, very good.
Very good.
All right everybody, take a break.
Thank you very much.
- Nice, man. That was tight.
- Brendon.
- Good set.
- Yeah.
That was great, man.
It's all good.
- Jah rules.
- Yeah.
You're going
to have to snap out of it, Luke.
She's just one chick...
and you're on the verge of finding out
just how many there are out there.
- I know, I know. You're right.
- I'm not going to bullshit you, Luke.
The state of mind you're in helped
with those last couple of songs...
but we're done with the ballads now...
and we're moving on to the poppy stuff.
So you're going to have to...
snap the hell out of it, Luke!
I pay $10,000 a day for this place!
And remember this.
It's not about the money.
It's about the money.
No, I know, you're
right. I'm with you 100%.
Screw 100%. I want more than 100%.
Do you have any idea what we have in store
for you over the next few weeks, huh?
Brendon, could you come in here?
Please, Brendon.
Tell him what we have scheduled for him
over the next couple of weeks.
Okay, we'll be in the studio 24l7.
Starting next week,
we'll monitor your intake.
No cigarettes, no alcohol.
No milk or citrus before recording.
Bedtime to be strictly observed. 10:00 pm.
Thank you.
Welcome to Tantra.
I love this song, Luke. I love it!
Okay, good. Great. Cool.
Death row just let us go
They ain't gonna make it
I need a love of mine
Your cold lines dancing on my spine
You're headstrong
Headstrong, uptight in your uniform
Okay, Luke.
Let's take a break.
I got a little something. We got you
a present for all your hard work.
It's just a little something I whipped up.
- I had no idea you were such a chef.
- Oh, yeah.
But hold tight I'll give you all I own
Stay in my favors
Were you expecting someone else?
No, no, Josie.
Walk out where the lions lie
And simply let it come undone
Let the sickos stare
'Cause they'll never have a love like ours
How about me. Do I get a little kiss?
Stay high with the falling stars
This is living
This is living
- I'm glad you made it.
- Sorry, I can't stay.
But you just walked in the door, man.
Yeah, I know, I know...
It's just, it's...
It's just not our scene.
Since when do you have a scene, man?
You gotta stay for my sax solo.
We can't. I've got a party in the hills
we need to go to.
If we get out early, I'll come back.
I've been trying to get
in touch with you all week.
I know. You're coming to
the Viper Room tomorrow, right?
I'll see you there.
Yeah. I don't really
know if that's my scene.
You are so funny. I'll see you there.
This is living
This is living
There's Mick Benson!
You slept with him, didn't you?
No. We just messed around, but...
this is different. I thought I loved him.
- And now you don't?
- No.
I mean, maybe, yeah.
- Sometimes.
- Sometimes?
What the hell does that mean?
It means I'm mixed up.
Mick's been looking for you.
- I can handle Mick.
- Maybe I should FedEx you...
- some pepper spray.
- I'll be fine.
- I can handle him.
- It's not Mick that I'm worried about.
- You're not?
- I'm more worried about this Luke guy.
Carrie, I was the one who hit
the eject button on this, all right?
Really? Or was it more like pause?
Where are you gonna stay?
You know, our drummer's brother's
roommate has a cousin.
He just moved in with his girlfriend,
so I'll just crash at his place.
Why are you leaving?
So you can spend
some more time with your...
- psycho Brazilian girlfriend.
- Which means?
- Which means, specifically?
- Yeah, specifically.
It means you're dating Darth Vader in drag.
No. She's not like that.
Look, man, you don't have to
go out with a girl who's...
Iooking over your shoulder
every five minutes...
to see if Leonardo DiCaprio
just walked in the room.
In LA? Not happening.
Then move. Get the hell out of here.
Or better yet, find a girl
who just moved here.
Do you know anyone like that? Do you
know anyone that just moved here, Luke?
I got a photo spread to go to.
You wanna come?
- I would love to. Can I?
- Yeah. I'll see you there.
Take pretty pictures.
Old habits die hard.
I knew I should have gotten
a restraining order.
- Hello, Mick.
- Hello, love.
I brought you a box of Ho-Hos.
Cut it out with the "love" crap.
We just wrapped LA.
We're gonna come back and do
another gig next week after San Diego.
I was kind of hoping you'd come.
You were hoping wrong.
The boys keep asking about you.
I did rather enjoy hearing about the...
- rabbit-eared twins?
- They just wanted publicity.
Look, I'm sorry, baby.
I should have made us a priority.
I can forgive you, Mick.
I just can't forget how you treated me.
There's a start.
Come and have dinner with me
next week after the show.
- No, thanks.
- Come on, Bri. For old time's sake.
- We used to have a lot of fun together.
- Yeah, before you screwed everything up.
You're right.
I did, and I want to make it up to you.
Look, we weren't just lovers.
You were my best friend.
- Come and have dinner with me.
- No.
Come and have lunch with me.
You don't even wake up before 5:00.
You're right. So lets have a very
early dinner at 6:00 before the show.
It is still light at 6:00, you know.
Not long enough.
Bri, please.
There are some things
that I really need to say to you.
I have to go pee.
Hey, Mick.
Mick, can you sign a ball for me?
My sisters are your biggest fans.
Even before they both won
the Miss World Bikini.
- Both of them?
- Yeah. They're twins.
How long ago was that?
- They've always been twins.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know. I realize that.
How long ago did they win the...
- Swimming competition?
- It was about a year ago.
My mother made them wait to enter
until they both turned 18.
Look. I got pictures of them.
You're at Mick's place, aren't you?
- He found you.
- What? No.
I'm in the men's bathroom.
Well, it could be worse.
- Can you smell him from where you are?
- What? No.
We've talked about this stuff, remember?
- Pheromones?
- You really believe in that crap?
I absolutely do.
Do you have any perfume on you?
Yeah.
I have some Possession.
That's ironic.
Thank you, Carrie.
Look. What I need you to do is spray...
a whole lot of it on your fingertips...
and then I need you to rub the insides
of both your nostrils.
Good Lord. Hold on, okay?
Mother...
Look here.
That's little Mamita,
and we call her La Niña.
That's by the pool.
- God bless you.
- Thank you.
His mother's very sick
and she's a big fan of mine...
so I said I'd send her some CDs.
So sorry to hear that. So sweet of you.
You should also know that...
So, that being said...
buenas noches.
- Mick, I'm sorry about that, man.
- Yeah. Whatever.
Hey, don't be like
that. Let me get a Ho-Ho.
Come on, man. Don't be like that, dawg.
Mick hears what he
wants to hear, but, yeah...
things run their course, you know?
Besides, it's more of a physical thing.
Okay. Assuming that I believe you...
which, by the way, I don't...
what are you gonna do about Luke?
And, by the way, he's not coming here.
Bri, hello. It's not him.
- Hi.
- Hi.
I don't know.
Guys just get in the way.
Besides, I have you, don't I?
Right.
So sad.
You ever had that feeling like
you're in two places at once?
Lukey, come on. Come over here.
You need to relax.
You go on in half an hour.
I'm sorry.
I'm not ready for this.
Oh, praise God, I'm all in fear
So hoping my soul is yours
Oh, dear God, my love is strong
Throw this dog another bone
This is living
This is living
Maybe I can see you in the evening
With the light on
Death row, just let us go
They ain't gonna make it
You are so hot!
Let's see what you got.
Stay off the stage, you bitch!
You're the bitch!
Luke!
I'm trying to see the show.
Oh, yeah
Hello?
Come on in.
Luke?
- Hi.
- Oh, hey, what's happening?
You moving?
Yeah.
I gotta get out of here.
You can actually help me.
It's just a block.
- Okay.
- There's not enough room in here for...
Luke, his gigantic ego,
and his fantastic girlfriend.
I didn't know he had a girlfriend.
Yeah. You know that South American
wombat he's been seeing?
Who, by the way,
is about as smart as that plant.
Yeah. I thought they were just friends.
They were just friends
until a couple of weeks ago...
when she made her big move.
Wait, hold on. She's moving in?
No. She's not moving in. She's just...
A love taxi. Don't worry about it.
A what?
Luke's just taking a ride. It won't last.
How do you know it won't last?
Because I've only seen
Luke in love two times.
The first time was with Wendy Marcus.
And that girl drove him to poetry. So...
That's sweet.
Yeah, she was the hot girl in seventh grade
that every guy had a crush on...
and Luke was just the one who...
Got some?
- Got kneed in the groin, actually.
- Ouch.
But, you know, that's...
what love is sometimes.
But it doesn't always have to be that way.
You know? Sometimes it actually works out
between two people.
Especially if one of them
is willing to take a chance.
What, your brother?
Are you denying that there is something
between you guys? Seriously.
I don't know.
I don't know. It's just...
He's had a little success,
and look what he's turned into.
This is not gonna last, I promise you that.
Luke is loyal...
This is my place. He's kind to animals.
I would go out with the guy.
If he weren't a guy.
And if he weren't my brother, I guess.
So Wendy Marcus and who?
- What?
- You said two loves.
Women have this amazing ability...
to hear something in the beginning
of a conversation...
and just, like, bring
it right back into the...
Wendy Marcus and who?
Why don't you just ask him yourself?
- Okay, Brier?
- Okay.
- Good night.
- So long.
- You go get him.
- I'll try.
They locked me
in a room upstairs for an hour.
Like a criminal. Okay?
- Assault is against the law.
- Whatever.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Okay, so tell me, did you date her?
- I didn't go out with her.
We went out
before you and I were anything.
And?
And then she blew me off.
You have a lot in common.
All right. You know what?
You have no idea what a joke you are.
Okay?
They hired me to get you noticed. Yeah.
But she knows.
It was her idea.
Excuse me.
Wait.
So you just pretended to like the music.
No, no, no. We all really liked the music.
We just, we pretended we liked you...
like, liked you, liked you.
I can't believe I fell for that.
I'm such an idiot.
It seemed like a good idea at the time.
God, she's pissed.
Look. All we tried to do, listen...
was try to make a nice guy a rock star.
I'm not a rock star. I'm not even close.
But you want to be.
No, wait. Look.
I really like you.
But the last place that I can be
because of my past...
Mick?
- How did you know...
- Euan googled you.
- I never meant to hurt you...
- Yeah, well, news flash.
You didn't hurt me. You killed me.
Thank you.
Josie, musicians, they're scum.
They can't help themselves.
I know these things.
You need someone older, more mature,
who can really pay attention to you.
Trust me. Let's have some coffee.
He faked everyone out.
All those people that you met that night,
they were just out of work actors...
that were pretending to like him
so that you would sign him.
- All of them?
- Yeah.
- Are you serious?
- Hello.
What can I get for you today?
I believe that you've met Jason Bond...
from Elektra.
No hard feelings, dude.
- Muffin?
- Bond.
I'm gonna kill you!
I'm gonna kill you!
- Dude, you're gonna get me fired.
- I don't care!
You're nothing, Bond! You're meat!
I'm very sorry to report that
as of this moment...
Luke Falcon...
will no longer be part of our roster.
Luke is battling many, many demons...
including the one where you
can't even leave your house.
Arachnophobia.
- Fear of spiders.
- And he has a fear of spiders.
Bill from Santa Monica,
you're on with Luke Falcon.
Yo, Luke. I just read on the internet
you just got dropped from your label, man.
Tantra!
Let's go to war, gentlemen.
I can't do this.
Luke, this is Brendon
from Garrett's office.
Listen. Garrett wanted
me to let you know...
that we've decided not to go forward
with your record.
And for that matter,
we won't be picking up our option.
Sorry to be...
Hey, Luke, it's Brendon.
We need to get the work...
Hey, Luke, I haven't heard
from you in a while...
Luke, yo, it's Ramon from the Dragonfly.
I'm gonna have to cancel your show
for next week.
I'll call you back in a couple of months
if anything opens up.
This message is for Luke Falcon.
This is Peggy from Tantra leasing.
It seems that last month's Porsche
payment didn't arrive.
As you might have guessed, we consider
the first payment to be very important.
Any questions, I can be reached...
That's it. Good to go.
Hey! That's my car!
I'm not here right now, so leave a message.
Hey, Luke, it's Brier.
I know. I've officially crossed over
into stalking territory...
Hey, Luke, it's your brother.
You remember me?
Look, my place is right up the street.
Why don't you come check it out?
This is Luke.
I'm not here right now, so leave a message.
Hey, Luke. It's Brier.
I'm really worried
about you and I miss you.
I want you to call me back. Okay?
He's really mad.
Yeah. And he might need to be
bitch slapped.
But he'll be all right.
You're gonna have to get me out of this.
Maybe it's when you realize
how much you miss her...
and how it's, like,
the feeling of being hurt...
feeling like you need somebody so much.
Like such an empty feeling.
You know what I mean?
- No, I do.
- I'd just dump him.
I don't even think about him.
- You ready? You want to do it again?
- Yeah. Sure.
Take it back, take it all back now
The things I gave
Like the taste of my kiss on your lips
I miss that now
Chorus.
All the things left undiscovered
That's good. Go.
Leave me empty and left to wonder
Now I need you
Yeah, I need you
Don't walk away
Two, three...
Away
God, I've been such a jerk.
We were the ones who screwed up.
We let it go way too far...
and I'm sorry.
And I know she is.
- At least we got a song out of it.
- But it was inevitable.
It was only gonna be short-term.
We knew that.
How about it?
Shortest music career in history.
It's not about careers.
In music, passions enjoy themselves.
- Yeah.
- Oh, nice, yeah.
That makes sense.
Is that a phone?
Ring tones. It's the future. Hello.
That's what happens when you
try to give yourself a colonic.
- I'm surprised the guy can even stand up.
- Yuck.
Drink a lot of fluids, I guess, and...
You know what? Actually, I think I'm
looking at the solution to your problem...
right now.
Let me call you right back, all right?
- Hey, little brother.
- Yeah?
How would you feel about...
getting a little funky?
I met you on somebody's island
You thought you had known me before
I brought you a crate of papaya
And waited all night by your door
You probably wouldn't remember
I probably couldn't forget
Jungle love in the surf in the pouring rain
Everything's better when wet
Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy
Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy, crazy
Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy, crazy
Jungle love, it's driving me mad
It's making me crazy
- Who's getting the hot chicks now?
- Nice thong, man.
Here are your plane tickets
for the redeye on Monday night.
You'll have one day in New York and then
you're off to the Caribbean for two days.
I don't know if I can do this.
You better suck it up, girlie.
This one's non-negotiable.
You're a fan of tough love.
No, when I am being tough with you,
you'll know it.
Now, when do I get
to meet this Luke character?
- I don't know. He won't talk to me.
- Why?
All you tried to do
was jump-start his career.
Quite selflessly, I might add.
- Before it turned to crap.
- Oh, come on.
That remains to be seen.
- You want to get out of here?
- Oh, please, God.
I want to meet some of these
LA hipster friends of yours.
Okay, here it comes.
Just remember, you gotta smile.
You gotta...
Oh, God, he looks awfully mean.
Smile.
Hi. Excuse me.
Hi. I'm Brier.
- How are you?
- I'm Clea.
Hi. This is Clea.
We were wondering about Luke.
We haven't seen him here in a while.
We adore him. We adore him.
Oh, my God. What color are your eyes?
Think positive.
Hey, Luke. It's Ben from The Mint.
Yeah, I know.
It's a shot in the dark, but I was hoping
you could fill in next Monday.
- Give me a call.
- Thank God.
Excuse me. Hello.
I have an announcement to make.
This looks serious.
I've made a decision, and...
I'm moving back to New York.
To the intellectually stimulating
world of modeling.
Yes. That and...
in pursuit of landing
an off-off-off-Broadway part.
Just like that?
Wow. Where did this come from?
I don't know. I miss the change in seasons.
I gotta do something different.
- It's good, right?
- It's great, Brier.
I think it's great.
Clea...
You understand, don't you?
Euan?
Euan?
Euan?
- What?
- Can I talk to you for a second?
Yeah, but these girls really
aren't getting enough potassium, so...
- Yeah, I can see.
- Do you think what Brier did was lame?
No, not lame. A little
Machiavellian, maybe.
- What does Brier have to gain?
- Nothing. She's just trying...
- Come on, baby.
- I'm coming.
She's just trying to
send you a little white light.
All right, so basically
I'm an ungrateful ass.
Yeah, pretty much. That's you.
The mobile subscriber
you're trying to reach...
is not available at this time.
Oh, how the mighty have fallen.
Fastest round-trip ticket I've ever seen.
I heard he has a drug problem.
- Horse tranquilizers.
- Really?
'Cause I heard the marketing guy
said he's too '90s.
All I know is I hope his set is short.
My band's going on right after.
I wouldn't worry about it.
Things will be fine. Horse tranquilizer?
Thanks.
Hey. Hey, check it out.
She is smoking hot.
Not the girl, you idiot.
You know who that guy is?
- Who, the old guy?
- Yeah.
It's Wick Treadway, man.
I've never seen this guy out, man.
This is big.
His non-compete must be up.
I gotta berry Garrett in on this one, man.
- Where's Brier?
- She just couldn't come in.
She'll meet you in your limo.
How do you guys know each other?
I'm the one who convinced him
to get out of the music industry.
It was one of her fabulous little rules.
What the hell was that rule? Buy...
Buy a mystery...
Sell on history.
The historic internet had just arrived.
We were shacked up in this little house
she had up in the canyon.
- You still got that house in the canyon?
- Yes.
We were shacked up in this little house
about 5:00 a.m.
She's lying next to me.
She pops up like burned toast...
starts screaming about music file sharing.
"Music file sharing! Music file sharing!"
Scared the hell out of me.
I stared selling that day.
Wait. You guys were together?
You could say that. We were...
What is the word? Married.
We were married.
Hello?
Wait, did you bring him here for Luke?
Well, he was sort of coming here anyway.
It's still good that he sees him, though.
A little J.P. Morgan walkabout.
What's that?
- Tell it, baby. Tell it.
- It's a famous story.
J.P. Had a friend of a friend
ask him to help a pal out.
So he looked at this guy's plan...
and he knows in a minute
he's not gonna finance it.
So he does the menschy thing, though.
He asked the guy to lunch...
and after lunch...
he takes him and walks him
all around Lower Manhattan...
with his arm around him.
So that when the guy who wanted
the money gets back to his office...
every banker in New York had called
wanting to finance his venture.
Our modern day J.P.
You're so brilliant. You're so brilliant.
I missed that when we split up.
- Oh, you.
- I miss that about you now.
This one's an old favorite...
called Boomerang.
It's only now that I truly appreciate it.
Help me, Lord, I thought I found it
Just like a dream turned out all wrong
Don't feel the same madness about me now
Don't feel the hurting when I'm gone
It keeps coming back without you
Like a boomerang through my heart
And cursed Cupid even found me alone
Into the wound another dart
Should I never look into your eyes again
Should I never want to give my all
Should I ever need you like my only friend
Should I read the writing on the wall?
He sounds really good tonight, huh?
And you look like death.
Never to be
If only one dreamer dreams of love
Who's the weird guy?
Play nice. He's your airport ride.
Just like a dream turned out all wrong
Don't feel the same madness about me now
She loves to hear the sadness in my song
I'm very thankful for being
back here tonight.
This next one I wrote with a friend of mine
about somebody special.
She can sing it a hell of a lot better
than I can, so...
You sure you wanna go?
Who else is gonna get me
through all my stuff?
You seem to be doing pretty well to me.
Yeah. It started happening when you...
- got me talking.
- Yeah.
- I'll miss you.
- I'll miss you, too.
Where the hell are you?
Don't get too used to this.
It's nice to see Luke back here tonight.
For a while there, I thought we lost him
to the dark side.
Anyways, I hope you guys like this song.
It's called Undiscovered.
Take it back, take it all back now
The things I gave
Like the taste of my kiss on your lips
I miss that now
I can't try any harder than I do
All the reasons I gave
Excuses I made for you
I'm broken in two
All the things left undiscovered
Left me waiting enough to wonder
I need you
Yeah, I need you
When I'm in the dark and all alone
Dreaming that you'll walk
right through my door
It's then I know my heart is whole
There's a million reasons why I cry
Pull my covers tight and close my eyes
'Cause I don't want to be alone
'Cause I can't fake and I can't hate
But it's my heart that's about to break
You're all I need, I'm on my knees
Watch me bleed
Would you listen, please?
I give in, I breathe out
I want you, there's no doubt
I freak out, I'm left out
Without you, I'm without
I'm crossed out, I'm kicked out
I cry out, I reach out
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
Don't walk away
- That was really beautiful.
- Yeah.
Give it up for Clea.
You're wonderful. I adore you...
- and I'm gonna call you.
- Thank you.
So he's here for her.
Somewhere there's a village
looking for you, you idiot.
That's the infamous Treadway
head fake, man.
- Come on. Let's go.
- Luke.
You were fantastic.
You gotta come and see us.
Hey, man, when you sang, it moved me.
- Seriously.
- Thanks.
I cried. Twice.
I like your shirt.
You and me are gonna go in the back...
That sounds great.
- I'm sure you're very good at it...
- Oh, I am.
And, I'm gonna pass.
But this, however, is my brother Euan...
and I'm sure he'd love to explore
your expertise.
Luke. That was amazing, man.
You were fantastic. I'm sorry about that
little bump in the road before.
- A little bump?
- It was more like road kill, right?
Listen, I've been thinking,
and I am going to give you another chance.
'Cause I think that with your talent
and your songs and my know-how...
that together with the right marketing
push, that we could be huge, man.
- We could blow up.
- You know what, Garrett?
You know, the only thing is,
I've been thinking about it, too.
And you can go blow yourself up.
And then give me a call.
So that's a maybe, right?
- I think that went well. What do you think?
- Where's Brier?
She left. I'm Carrie.
The Carrie?
Nice to meet you.
Do you know where she is?
Airport.
- Picking up somebody?
- Moving.
- What?
- Back to New York.
United, 11:00.
I got to go get her. Thank you.
I need a ride.
What happened to your car?
A rude guy with a tow truck took it away.
I'll meet you out back.
- Thanks for the ride.
- Happy to be of service.
Because the way we kiss
is better than any drug
Because when I'm with you,
I believe in love
'Cause you'll take chances
most people would never take
- She really digs you, you know.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
- Huh?
Is that why she's not picking up her phone
while she's moving 3,000 miles away?
Why don't you just go with her?
Why would I do that?
A better question is,
why the hell wouldn't you do that?
... found someone as crazy as myself
No matter what I've done,
you always come when I cry
Here we are.
Yeah, that's why I love you
And that's why I love you
There's no one in this world
Good evening, Mr. Treadway.
- I'm Dirk.
- Yes. Of course you are.
I'll take your bags upstairs for you.
Here's your boarding pass.
Very good.
And if you'll come with me, sir,
through the VIP Express.
Pull in. Pull in.
Let me say once again
what an honor it's been.
Brier, why don't you go ahead and board?
I gotta make some phone calls.
- Can you wait for me?
- Yeah, yeah. Hurry up, man. I got plans.
Can you tell me what gate
the 11:00 flight to New York leaves from?
I'm sorry, sir, but only ticketed
passengers are allowed to go to the gate.
Well, how much is the ticket?
- Coach or first class?
- What do you think?
One fully refundable coach ticket
is $1,100.19.
Euan!
Euan.
- I need to borrow your credit card.
- Why?
I need to buy a plane ticket.
That's killer, man.
You're gonna go with her.
Please give me the card.
Yeah, but I don't think they're gonna take
my Blockbuster card, man, that's all I got.
Oh.
How much is it? How much is the ticket?
$1,100.19.
- I thought you were gonna say, like, $200.
- I know, Euan, I know. It's...
Look...
I can't believe I am doing this.
Where the hell did you get that?
I told you I made some money.
- Just take it.
- And you keep it in your pants?
Where else am I gonna keep it? The bank?
- You are not well. I love you. Thank you.
- Get outta here.
- Hey, hey. Take this.
- Well, what is this?
It's dinner. They charge you
for food on the planes now.
Thank you.
What'd you do, rob a bank?
Sunglass stand.
Can I have a ticket, please?
The flight's delayed.
You may actually make it.
- Thank you.
- Good luck.
Final boarding call for United flight 103
to New York.
Any remaining passengers,
please proceed to Gate 77...
for immediate boarding
as this flight is now closed.
- Mr. Falcon?
- Yeah.
- May we have a word with you, please?
- Oh, come on.
Why did you pay cash
for your airline ticket?
My credit card's maxed out.
And do you usually carry that much
cash on your person?
Oh, come on! Do I look like a terrorist?
- Yes, a little.
- Hello, Luke.
Hi.
Is this a friend of yours?
Well, as a matter of fact, I caught
Luke's show in the city tonight.
- You're a musician, then?
- That's right. He's a musician.
Kind of like that Cat Stevens person.
- Thanks, Dirk.
- Sure.
Dude, do I know you?
Just consider me a fan.
- Thanks for your help.
- Swinging.
Would you gentlemen
please find your seats?
Yes, thank you.
- I'll help you.
- Thank you. Very kind of you.
I love life's little adventures.
Don't you?
Sorry. I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Sorry. Yeah.
So you never told him you were leaving?
It would've been too sad.
He's a damn good songwriter.
Is that the good news or the bad news?
Maybe one, maybe both.
Maybe neither.
So sorry, but he made me promise
to deliver it that way to you.
I think you have a second chance
to say goodbye.
I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Hi.
I heard you tonight.
You left without saying goodbye.
It just got to be too much.
Excuse me.
I...
- I never meant to hurt you.
- Yeah.
- Sorry.
- It's all right.
- L...
- No. Me first, okay?
I...
I love you. I do. But I just...
I can't...
- I can't deal with the groupies and the...
- Brier.
...touring and, you know...
I'm just a songwriter.
I'm happy writing songs.
And...
And playing The Mint on Monday nights.
But I'd give that up if...
I love you.
From the first moment I saw you.
- Hi.
- Hello.
This is not the Wizard of Oz.
This is actually Wick Treadway.
- Luke Falcon.
- Pink Sands.
I didn't mean to eavesdrop or...
I mean, actually, I did mean to eavesdrop,
but I just thought...
I could throw a little something-something
into this Apache dance here.
Listen, Luke...
at this particular moment in time, I only
have room for one new act on my roster...
And that little deal was contingent
upon seeing the artist...
live last night, and she was brilliant.
With your help, as I understand.
Which leads me to you.
Now unless I'm wrong, you're gonna enjoy
a very long ride in this business...
if you get down on the reality that
the only solid business in music...
isn't performing.
It's publishing.
What does that mean?
It means Erna Mansen.
It means Patsy Netbruse.
- It means Bart Howard.
- Who?
You don't know their names, but you know
their music. You know their words.
You been listening to their songs
a hundred times a day...
people listening to them
from New York to Beijing.
- I like that.
- I knew you would.
Dig it. Hemingway had it right.
Fame is a bitch goddess.
Fame is fraud, man.
Fame is nothing. It's foam.
Fame will break your heart, brother.
But creativity, listen up, is passion.
And it's endless.
You look for fame, you'll lose your soul.
You look for creation, you'll find it.
So listen up.
If you're interested...
you wanna continue this little conversation
about publishing deals...
maybe we'll talk in Jamaica.
If you're invited.
Wait. How did you know
I was going to Jamaica?
You're going to Jamaica to do a video with
an old reggae group that I am reinventing.
You're the client.
If you want an extra ticket, let me know.
Bye.
Thank you.
Do you wanna go away with me?
- Under one condition.
- Oh, yeah? What's that?
That you're with me and only me.
Where would we live?
Anywhere you want.
I can write from anywhere.
Hello, little brother.
Or should I say, "Hello, Rastaman"?
Yeah, hardly. Yeah, you need to see
what I'm letting her do to me. Hold on.
A new do, huh? I think it's about time.
Hey, how's the pup?
The world's greatest chick magnet.
He's doing what he does best.
- Is that your dog?
- Yeah.
- He's so cute!
- Thank you.
You're not getting this dog back.
My plan is to have him surfing...
next time you come out here.
Yeah, I don't doubt that, man.
Hey, listen, I'll talk
to you soon, all right?
Listen, little brother. You gotta
start writing us some songs, okay?
The band signed a little record contract...
and we're not doing covers anymore.
- I'll see what I can do.
- All right, bye.
