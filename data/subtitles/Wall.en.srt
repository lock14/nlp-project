1
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:36,086
- You come here to play?
- We're just wandering.

2
00:00:37,327 --> 00:00:39,887
- What was here before?
- I don't know.

3
00:00:40,047 --> 00:00:42,003
Don't film me!

4
00:00:49,647 --> 00:00:52,207
- What's this?
- It's the wall!

5
00:00:52,367 --> 00:00:55,962
- What for?
- They shoot Arabs from here.

6
00:00:56,407 --> 00:01:00,559
- No, Arabs shoot at us.
- So we hide behind the wall.

7
00:01:01,927 --> 00:01:03,246
Who shoots at who?

8
00:01:03,407 --> 00:01:05,284
There's an Arab village here.

9
00:01:05,447 --> 00:01:07,085
Beit Jala.

10
00:01:10,687 --> 00:01:13,042
- What's your name?
- Maayan.

11
00:01:13,487 --> 00:01:15,637
- And yours?
- Avia.

12
00:01:20,687 --> 00:01:23,679
We ran away,
we thought you were Arabs.

13
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:28,116
We saw the camera
and thought it was a weapon.

14
00:01:29,847 --> 00:01:33,601
That stick,
it looks like a weapon.

15
00:01:35,247 --> 00:01:36,999
But you came back.

16
00:01:37,287 --> 00:01:38,845
We saw who you are.

17
00:01:39,007 --> 00:01:40,281
Who are we?

18
00:01:40,847 --> 00:01:44,317
Jews, what a question!

19
00:01:45,807 --> 00:01:47,843
- Are you sure?
- Of what?

20
00:01:48,007 --> 00:01:50,237
That we're Jews...

21
00:01:50,407 --> 00:01:51,920
You aren't Jewish?

22
00:01:52,927 --> 00:01:54,246
Maybe not!

23
00:01:58,007 --> 00:02:00,077
How do you know we're Jews?

24
00:02:00,247 --> 00:02:02,636
- I can tell.
- How?

25
00:02:03,047 --> 00:02:05,197
By the language.

26
00:02:06,287 --> 00:02:08,960
And if I spoke another language?

27
00:02:09,807 --> 00:02:11,877
I can tell by the accent.

28
00:02:12,727 --> 00:02:14,797
And if I spoke Arabic,

29
00:02:14,967 --> 00:02:17,242
would you know it's Arabic?

30
00:02:17,407 --> 00:02:19,921
Yeah, my mom speaks Arabic.

31
00:02:20,087 --> 00:02:22,203
We can tell by the face.

32
00:02:22,767 --> 00:02:25,679
- Your mother speaks Arabic?
- Yeah, she's from Morocco.

33
00:02:27,287 --> 00:02:29,926
When your mother speaks Arabic...

34
00:02:30,087 --> 00:02:31,964
She doesn't speak Arabic at home!

35
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:35,200
- Why?
- Because I don't understand.

36
00:02:35,887 --> 00:02:38,720
But when she speaks Arabic,

37
00:02:39,727 --> 00:02:43,276
one might think she's an Arab, no?

38
00:02:44,647 --> 00:02:54,602
WALL

39
00:09:49,527 --> 00:09:51,563
Are you filming the wall?

40
00:09:54,607 --> 00:09:56,518
What do you think of it?

41
00:09:56,687 --> 00:09:57,961
It's a prison!

42
00:09:58,607 --> 00:10:00,325
What's the difference?

43
00:10:00,487 --> 00:10:02,364
None, right?

44
00:10:06,687 --> 00:10:08,166
Is he filming?

45
00:10:10,847 --> 00:10:12,724
He's recording.

46
00:10:15,927 --> 00:10:17,758
Let him record!

47
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:23,761
What can I say?

48
00:10:25,007 --> 00:10:27,646
I've had enough suffering.

49
00:10:27,807 --> 00:10:29,843
We've been suffering
for 3 years now.

50
00:10:40,647 --> 00:10:43,161
We need to live together,
that's it.

51
00:10:44,127 --> 00:10:46,197
And leave our destiny to God!

52
00:10:46,367 --> 00:10:47,641
God willing!

53
00:10:58,487 --> 00:11:01,081
- What's your name?
- Bilal Mansour.

54
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,406
From Qalqilya.

55
00:11:06,607 --> 00:11:07,437
Maram.

56
00:11:07,607 --> 00:11:08,881
Hamoudi.

57
00:11:09,167 --> 00:11:10,316
Amir.

58
00:11:10,967 --> 00:11:12,241
Khadije.

59
00:11:49,047 --> 00:11:50,366
General Amos Yaron,

60
00:11:50,527 --> 00:11:54,042
You are the director general
of the Israeli Ministry of Defense.

61
00:11:54,207 --> 00:11:58,325
I would like to ask you
some technical questions

62
00:11:58,487 --> 00:12:01,081
about the construction
of the security fence.

63
00:12:03,847 --> 00:12:07,920
Let us start at the beginning.

64
00:12:09,447 --> 00:12:11,722
First, I want to tell you

65
00:12:11,887 --> 00:12:15,038
why we needed to go

66
00:12:15,647 --> 00:12:17,922
and build a fence.

67
00:12:18,967 --> 00:12:21,720
The reason is clear.

68
00:12:22,047 --> 00:12:26,518
It is an effective way

69
00:12:27,607 --> 00:12:30,997
to significantly reduce

70
00:12:31,407 --> 00:12:34,558
the penetrative capabilities

71
00:12:34,727 --> 00:12:38,606
of Palestinians who come

72
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:42,404
to commit terrorist acts
inside the State of Israel,

73
00:12:42,567 --> 00:12:46,606
in the populous urban centers
along the coastal plane,

74
00:12:46,767 --> 00:12:50,043
and in other areas.

75
00:12:50,207 --> 00:12:54,041
It is a very effective way
to prevent terrorists

76
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:58,803
from committing their crimes
inside Israeli territory.

77
00:12:59,687 --> 00:13:03,760
This is the primary reason
behind this investment.

78
00:13:04,607 --> 00:13:06,882
The secondary reason

79
00:13:07,727 --> 00:13:10,002
is that for many years

80
00:13:11,927 --> 00:13:15,397
the Palestinians considered Israel

81
00:13:15,567 --> 00:13:17,637
to be an unlimited resource

82
00:13:17,807 --> 00:13:22,517
for stolen goods,
especially cars

83
00:13:22,687 --> 00:13:26,805
and agricultural equipment.

84
00:13:27,167 --> 00:13:29,920
This made Israelis
living on the seam-line

85
00:13:30,407 --> 00:13:33,319
feel insecure.

86
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:36,877
It made all Israeli citizens
feel insecure.

87
00:13:37,047 --> 00:13:39,766
The rates of theft
and burglary

88
00:13:39,927 --> 00:13:41,918
have risen drastically.

89
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,203
It's a huge project!

90
00:13:44,367 --> 00:13:46,244
It's a project which,

91
00:13:46,407 --> 00:13:49,843
from an engineering perspective,

92
00:13:50,127 --> 00:13:53,836
is the greatest Israel has known.

93
00:13:54,207 --> 00:13:58,519
Each day, more than 500
pieces of heavy machinery

94
00:13:59,727 --> 00:14:01,797
move and transport

95
00:14:01,967 --> 00:14:05,403
millions of cubic meters
of earth.

96
00:14:06,407 --> 00:14:08,921
Each kilometer

97
00:14:09,087 --> 00:14:13,558
costs around 10 million shekels.

98
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:17,720
That's about 2 million dollars
per kilometer.

99
00:14:17,887 --> 00:14:21,562
In other words, if the project

100
00:14:22,647 --> 00:14:24,922
is 500 kilometers long,

101
00:14:25,087 --> 00:14:27,442
its total cost will be

102
00:14:27,607 --> 00:14:30,280
around 5 billion shekels.

103
00:16:02,247 --> 00:16:06,718
One day,
my uncle who works in town,

104
00:16:07,887 --> 00:16:09,923
in the Samiramis area,

105
00:16:10,727 --> 00:16:12,638
saw a military vehicle

106
00:16:12,807 --> 00:16:16,243
distributing flyers
as it drove by.

107
00:16:17,607 --> 00:16:21,646
We read the flyers and saw

108
00:16:21,807 --> 00:16:25,686
that they announced
land expropriation.

109
00:16:26,527 --> 00:16:28,324
We collected these flyers,

110
00:16:28,847 --> 00:16:30,838
and did what had to be done.

111
00:16:31,247 --> 00:16:34,159
We translated them,
and studied them,

112
00:16:35,687 --> 00:16:38,884
and met with
the other land owners.

113
00:16:39,047 --> 00:16:43,086
We decided
to appeal to the court

114
00:16:43,247 --> 00:16:46,842
to try and stop
the construction of the fence.

115
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:51,398
Or at least,
if we can't stop it,

116
00:16:51,647 --> 00:16:53,683
to push it further away

117
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:57,476
so it won't separate
the inhabitants from their land,

118
00:16:57,647 --> 00:17:00,525
neither in Kufr Aqab
nor in Qalandia.

119
00:17:02,127 --> 00:17:05,437
We appealed to the judge
but he rejected our plea.

120
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:08,121
Our lawyer, Neta Amar,

121
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,280
God bless her,
is a Jewish woman.

122
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:13,517
She worked very hard
on our behalf.

123
00:17:14,247 --> 00:17:17,080
We tried to resolve the problem
but the judge refused.

124
00:17:17,247 --> 00:17:19,681
As you see, the fence is here.

125
00:17:19,847 --> 00:17:24,523
The army patrols pass by
every 2 or 3 hours.

126
00:18:09,807 --> 00:18:11,445
So?

127
00:18:12,767 --> 00:18:16,077
It looks like they've
done a lot of work!

128
00:18:17,167 --> 00:18:18,566
Has it progressed?

129
00:18:18,767 --> 00:18:19,961
Oh yeah!

130
00:18:21,327 --> 00:18:25,718
Now they're doing the asphalt.

131
00:18:47,687 --> 00:18:51,475
What else has changed since
you last saw it?

132
00:18:51,647 --> 00:18:56,243
Now there are cables and sensors.

133
00:19:24,527 --> 00:19:27,599
Could you explain how it works?

134
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:31,237
The basis of the obstacle
is the fence,

135
00:19:31,447 --> 00:19:33,278
erected upon

136
00:19:34,727 --> 00:19:37,605
a solid concrete foundation.

137
00:19:37,767 --> 00:19:42,397
In addition to being
a physical obstacle,

138
00:19:42,567 --> 00:19:44,876
it's also an electronic obstacle.

139
00:19:45,047 --> 00:19:49,438
Whoever approaches it,
or touches it,

140
00:19:49,887 --> 00:19:52,003
sets off an alert
in a control room

141
00:19:52,167 --> 00:19:56,957
where everything
can be seen and heard.

142
00:19:57,447 --> 00:20:01,235
If someone tries
to cross the fence,

143
00:20:01,407 --> 00:20:03,921
it will trigger an alarm.

144
00:20:04,087 --> 00:20:06,521
The surveillance forces
will know it.

145
00:20:06,687 --> 00:20:10,600
If someone tries to cut it,
there will be an indication,

146
00:20:10,767 --> 00:20:13,918
and within minutes
the soldiers will be there

147
00:20:14,087 --> 00:20:16,476
to keep him from crossing.

148
00:20:16,647 --> 00:20:17,921
Is it a camera?

149
00:20:18,087 --> 00:20:23,445
It's cameras,
electronic devices, and radars!

150
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:27,402
It's a whole system
of surveillance

151
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:32,083
around the fence
and beyond it.

152
00:20:32,847 --> 00:20:36,920
I also see trenches,
barbed wire,

153
00:20:37,487 --> 00:20:40,399
paved roads, dirt roads...
How does it work?

154
00:20:40,567 --> 00:20:44,719
The entire obstacle begins
with barbed wire

155
00:20:45,007 --> 00:20:47,760
on the Judea and Samaria side.

156
00:20:47,927 --> 00:20:50,521
Barbed wire.

157
00:20:50,687 --> 00:20:53,247
This is the first warning.

158
00:20:53,407 --> 00:20:58,083
If someone happens upon it,
it says: ''Go away!''

159
00:20:59,247 --> 00:21:02,603
If someone wants to cross it
deliberately, it will delay him.

160
00:21:02,767 --> 00:21:04,405
Then there's a ditch

161
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:08,037
to keep vehicles from crossing.

162
00:21:08,767 --> 00:21:13,238
Then there's the fence itself
on its concrete foundation.

163
00:21:13,407 --> 00:21:17,798
The indicative fence
that triggers the alert.

164
00:21:18,327 --> 00:21:20,716
Then there's a dirt road.

165
00:21:20,887 --> 00:21:23,481
If crossed, it will reveal

166
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:27,560
footprints that can be tracked.

167
00:21:27,727 --> 00:21:29,843
After that there's a paved road

168
00:21:30,007 --> 00:21:32,726
so our forces can
move at speed

169
00:21:32,887 --> 00:21:35,845
from one point to another.

170
00:21:36,007 --> 00:21:38,043
Finally, there's more barbed wire.

171
00:21:38,567 --> 00:21:41,639
In the event someone
does manage to cross

172
00:21:41,807 --> 00:21:44,241
it will delay him further

173
00:21:44,407 --> 00:21:46,682
until our forces arrive.

174
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:50,601
It will give them
a few minutes to get there

175
00:21:50,767 --> 00:21:54,999
and catch him
inside the fenced zone.

176
00:21:55,407 --> 00:21:59,320
That's more or less how it works.

177
00:21:59,487 --> 00:22:02,160
- How wide is it?
- About 50 meters.

178
00:23:07,047 --> 00:23:09,561
A good life,
that's all we ask for.

179
00:23:09,727 --> 00:23:11,877
Working hard doesn't matter

180
00:23:12,047 --> 00:23:14,083
as long as there's peace and quiet.

181
00:23:17,567 --> 00:23:19,922
- Where are you from?
- Meitav.

182
00:23:20,087 --> 00:23:21,520
Here, in the Taanakhim.

183
00:23:22,327 --> 00:23:24,636
- You weren't born in Meitav!
- No, in Iraq.

184
00:23:24,807 --> 00:23:27,719
Where the war was,
where Saddam Hussein was.

185
00:23:29,127 --> 00:23:30,958
That's where I come from.

186
00:23:42,887 --> 00:23:45,401
We were better off there.

187
00:23:45,807 --> 00:23:48,082
We thought that here,

188
00:23:48,247 --> 00:23:52,763
in our land, we'd find
refuge from all these problems.

189
00:23:53,167 --> 00:23:56,557
But on the contrary,
here, we have problems.

190
00:24:17,327 --> 00:24:19,443
- Are these your workers?
- Yes.

191
00:24:19,767 --> 00:24:21,598
- Where are they from?
- Here.

192
00:24:21,767 --> 00:24:23,644
The West Bank.

193
00:24:23,807 --> 00:24:26,879
- From which village?
- This village, Jalame.

194
00:24:28,727 --> 00:24:31,764
But they have all
the required permits.

195
00:24:34,527 --> 00:24:36,916
- They live in this village?
- Yes.

196
00:24:37,527 --> 00:24:39,677
The Jews don't want to work.

197
00:24:39,967 --> 00:24:41,559
If it weren't for
the West Bankers,

198
00:24:41,727 --> 00:24:45,197
it would take another 50 years
to build this fence.

199
00:24:46,167 --> 00:24:50,445
Isn't it strange that they're
building it around themselves?

200
00:24:50,607 --> 00:24:52,996
No, on the contrary.
It's good for them.

201
00:24:53,647 --> 00:24:55,922
It's not like in Israel.

202
00:24:56,327 --> 00:24:58,761
They don't get unemployment.

203
00:24:58,927 --> 00:25:02,397
If they don't work,
they'll starve to death.

204
00:25:03,487 --> 00:25:05,842
Would you like to visit Iraq?

205
00:25:06,007 --> 00:25:07,884
Yes. Very much.

206
00:25:09,807 --> 00:25:13,641
If they allowed me,
I'd go tomorrow!

207
00:25:14,127 --> 00:25:16,322
My village still exists.

208
00:25:17,047 --> 00:25:18,719
Which village is that?

209
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:20,761
Arbil.

210
00:25:21,927 --> 00:25:25,283
We lived outside of town.

211
00:25:26,327 --> 00:25:29,205
We were farmers.

212
00:25:29,367 --> 00:25:31,801
- You remember?
- Very well.

213
00:25:32,487 --> 00:25:34,000
What did you grow?

214
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:35,680
Watermelons,

215
00:25:35,847 --> 00:25:38,236
cucumbers, tomatoes.

216
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:42,799
But there,
a watermelon grows this big!

217
00:25:44,407 --> 00:25:47,126
There, you dig one meter
and hit water.

218
00:25:47,287 --> 00:25:49,039
Not like here.

219
00:25:55,087 --> 00:25:57,043
We grew everything there.

220
00:25:58,367 --> 00:26:00,961
We grew dates too.

221
00:26:03,047 --> 00:26:04,924
- What's your name?
- Shimon.

222
00:26:07,567 --> 00:26:09,364
- Shimon what?
- Abraham.

223
00:26:50,087 --> 00:26:52,521
- You're all Arabs here!
- Yes.

224
00:26:53,927 --> 00:26:55,440
What's the problem?

225
00:26:55,647 --> 00:26:59,242
It's strange that Arabs
are building the fence!

226
00:27:01,407 --> 00:27:05,002
Arabs, Jews, Russians, Bulgarians...

227
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:08,603
This fence is being built
by people the world over!

228
00:27:10,647 --> 00:27:12,797
Does it pay well, at least?

229
00:27:13,407 --> 00:27:17,286
I know what I earn.
I can't speak for the others.

230
00:27:17,447 --> 00:27:19,677
As far as I'm concerned,
the pay is good.

231
00:27:21,207 --> 00:27:24,119
I got what I asked for.

232
00:27:25,127 --> 00:27:27,038
- What's your name?
- Ahmad.

233
00:27:27,407 --> 00:27:28,522
Bye!

234
00:27:28,687 --> 00:27:30,245
Shalom, Ahmad.

235
00:27:30,527 --> 00:27:31,721
Go in peace!

236
00:27:44,007 --> 00:27:46,282
I'm the foreman here,

237
00:27:47,007 --> 00:27:48,998
I'm responsible for the work.

238
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,805
Where do you live?

239
00:27:51,607 --> 00:27:52,835
Nablus.

240
00:27:59,287 --> 00:28:01,642
- Work is good.
- Yes.

241
00:28:02,527 --> 00:28:04,279
We need work.

242
00:28:06,887 --> 00:28:08,798
And the fence, is it good?

243
00:28:09,607 --> 00:28:12,963
This fence is worthless.
Without peace, it's worthless!

244
00:28:14,407 --> 00:28:15,999
Am I right?

245
00:28:16,167 --> 00:28:18,044
Just a waste of money.

246
00:28:21,407 --> 00:28:24,285
If he films me,
the PLO will kill me.

247
00:28:26,927 --> 00:28:28,565
What's your name?

248
00:28:29,647 --> 00:28:31,000
Abu Hani.

249
00:28:31,447 --> 00:28:33,358
Nice to meet you, Abu Hani.

250
00:29:41,927 --> 00:29:43,599
Good morning!

251
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:49,645
Film the East side too.
We're closed on both sides.

252
00:29:50,247 --> 00:29:52,363
To the East and to the West.

253
00:29:52,687 --> 00:29:55,201
Jabara is encircled.

254
00:29:55,967 --> 00:29:57,559
Is there a fence there?

255
00:29:57,727 --> 00:30:00,116
Yes, behind the village.

256
00:30:01,207 --> 00:30:04,005
A fence in the back,
and a gate in the front.

257
00:30:04,407 --> 00:30:08,639
They only open it
1-2 hours a day.

258
00:30:09,207 --> 00:30:11,084
Then they lock it again.

259
00:30:11,647 --> 00:30:12,921
Since when?

260
00:30:13,607 --> 00:30:16,758
About 4 or 5 months.

261
00:30:17,767 --> 00:30:21,043
Since they started with
this barbed wire.

262
00:30:23,807 --> 00:30:26,685
<i>Take his ID and his permits.</i>

263
00:30:26,847 --> 00:30:28,644
<i>The Mercedes, yes.</i>

264
00:30:47,687 --> 00:30:50,201
<i>Go get their IDs.</i>

265
00:30:50,687 --> 00:30:52,643
<i>Take their IDs.</i>

266
00:32:29,367 --> 00:32:31,597
<i>Nasser, Ali,</i>

267
00:32:33,047 --> 00:32:34,321
<i>Ghassan.</i>

268
00:32:35,207 --> 00:32:39,564
<i>Ghassan, Nasser, Ali, come here.</i>

269
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:42,519
Stand on the side.

270
00:32:47,207 --> 00:32:48,401
Engine off!

271
00:32:51,927 --> 00:32:54,077
Give me both your IDs.

272
00:33:02,727 --> 00:33:04,319
Where you're going? Shufa?

273
00:33:05,527 --> 00:33:08,041
Kufr Sur?
But you live in Shufa.

274
00:33:12,367 --> 00:33:14,164
He too, right?
Get out.

275
00:33:17,287 --> 00:33:18,766
Open this thing.

276
00:33:31,807 --> 00:33:33,206
Open the box.

277
00:33:36,807 --> 00:33:38,081
Close it up.

278
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:47,486
What do you have here?

279
00:33:56,047 --> 00:33:58,845
Don't approach two at a time.
One at a time!

280
00:34:00,967 --> 00:34:03,527
One by one!
Why are you approaching?

281
00:34:03,687 --> 00:34:06,520
Step back!
Everybody back.

282
00:34:09,887 --> 00:34:11,240
Open the bag.

283
00:34:13,527 --> 00:34:15,279
You live in Kufr Sur?

284
00:34:17,687 --> 00:34:19,518
One at a time. Wait!

285
00:34:19,687 --> 00:34:22,884
You're an Israeli citizen.
What are you doing here?

286
00:34:24,967 --> 00:34:26,844
What are you doing here?

287
00:34:27,407 --> 00:34:29,238
How did you enter?

288
00:34:33,287 --> 00:34:34,481
Your house?

289
00:34:35,727 --> 00:34:39,276
This is the last time
I let you pass through here.

290
00:34:41,727 --> 00:34:43,763
What are you doing here?

291
00:34:44,087 --> 00:34:47,363
You're an Israeli citizen,
you're not allowed to be here.

292
00:34:48,207 --> 00:34:51,040
You know it's forbidden
for you to enter.

293
00:34:51,727 --> 00:34:53,126
From where?

294
00:34:53,887 --> 00:34:55,115
From Baqa?

295
00:34:56,767 --> 00:34:58,485
From here it's impossible.

296
00:35:00,807 --> 00:35:02,843
I can't let you pass.

297
00:35:04,007 --> 00:35:07,124
You entered from there,
now exit from there.

298
00:35:07,287 --> 00:35:08,766
That's how it goes.

299
00:35:08,927 --> 00:35:11,964
Israeli citizens aren't
allowed to go in.

300
00:35:15,527 --> 00:35:17,165
You can't pass.

301
00:35:17,727 --> 00:35:19,683
I can't let you.

302
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:24,406
Not from here.

303
00:35:28,087 --> 00:35:29,566
Where are you going?

304
00:35:30,047 --> 00:35:32,720
Tulkarm?
This way, not that way.

305
00:35:39,687 --> 00:35:41,200
One at a time!

306
00:35:45,567 --> 00:35:46,920
Where do you live?

307
00:36:49,807 --> 00:36:53,356
At the first terrorist attack here,

308
00:36:53,527 --> 00:36:56,519
the value of the apartments
would plummet.

309
00:36:58,087 --> 00:37:00,476
I don't feel 100% safe here.

310
00:37:00,647 --> 00:37:02,239
I don't dawdle.

311
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:05,838
After work,
I come straight home.

312
00:37:06,007 --> 00:37:08,840
My wife doesn't open
the door for anybody.

313
00:37:09,007 --> 00:37:11,362
I live in the first row.

314
00:37:12,887 --> 00:37:14,445
It's the most dangerous.

315
00:37:14,607 --> 00:37:17,201
What's the distance?
2 kilometers?

316
00:37:18,007 --> 00:37:21,716
He can strap a tank to his back
and be here in 30 minutes.

317
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:26,524
You think he doesn't know
the jeep's routine?

318
00:37:26,687 --> 00:37:29,645
He'll figure out the routine
before he comes.

319
00:37:29,807 --> 00:37:33,720
A fence?
He'll climb over it with a ladder.

320
00:37:34,847 --> 00:37:38,965
I was 20 meters away from
the last suicide bombing.

321
00:37:39,247 --> 00:37:40,805
I work on Agripas street.

322
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:43,003
The whole building shook.

323
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:46,876
We can't live like this!
We have children.

324
00:37:47,247 --> 00:37:50,080
The solution? I don't know.
Maybe this guy from France...

325
00:37:50,247 --> 00:37:54,399
will bring Kofi Annan,
maybe a NATO force.

326
00:37:54,887 --> 00:37:57,355
Who knows.
There is no solution.

327
00:37:57,767 --> 00:38:01,726
Here, in Har Homa,
people are scared.

328
00:38:01,887 --> 00:38:03,684
Children don't come out to play.

329
00:38:03,847 --> 00:38:07,442
Even at home they're nervous.

330
00:38:07,607 --> 00:38:11,486
They'd enjoy the fresh air
if they felt safe, wouldn't they?

331
00:38:12,447 --> 00:38:14,244
They're scared.

332
00:38:15,527 --> 00:38:17,324
The Sabbath is upon us.

333
00:38:17,487 --> 00:38:21,480
Let us pray for the Holy Land,
that's all we can do.

334
00:38:21,807 --> 00:38:23,684
And hope for the best.

335
00:38:25,207 --> 00:38:28,404
This million-dollar fence
doesn't make you feel secure?

336
00:38:28,567 --> 00:38:31,764
Secure? It's a waste of money.

337
00:38:33,967 --> 00:38:39,121
Were the fence the solution,
they'd have built it 50 years ago.

338
00:38:40,687 --> 00:38:43,724
2 million dollars worth of fence
will solve the problem?

339
00:38:44,807 --> 00:38:46,035
Forget it!

340
00:38:46,207 --> 00:38:48,767
They'll find ways
to circumvent it.

341
00:38:48,927 --> 00:38:51,919
They'll get Israeli Arabs

342
00:38:52,087 --> 00:38:54,726
to smuggle in explosives
for suicide bombings.

343
00:38:54,887 --> 00:38:58,482
We need to negotiate.

344
00:38:58,967 --> 00:39:00,605
It's like a border:

345
00:39:00,767 --> 00:39:02,678
Jews here, Arabs there.

346
00:39:02,847 --> 00:39:06,237
Let's say we attack them,

347
00:39:06,487 --> 00:39:10,002
we do an operation in Gaza.
They have children too!

348
00:39:10,287 --> 00:39:12,005
Let's say we kill their children?

349
00:39:12,167 --> 00:39:13,839
We're strangling them.

350
00:39:14,007 --> 00:39:16,202
Some unemployed guy
will go crazy

351
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:18,517
and will come
to attack our children.

352
00:39:18,967 --> 00:39:22,084
A solution?
I wish I had one.

353
00:39:22,407 --> 00:39:24,523
If I had one I'd bring Barak

354
00:39:24,687 --> 00:39:28,521
Sharon, Abu Mazen,
I'd host them all at my place.

355
00:39:28,847 --> 00:39:32,237
If need be,
I'll give my house for peace.

356
00:39:32,807 --> 00:39:35,241
Does anybody have
a formula for peace?

357
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:38,205
A fence?
Now that's a joke!

358
00:39:41,247 --> 00:39:43,238
- What's your name?
- Moti.

359
00:39:44,727 --> 00:39:47,446
It's the first time I'm on TV.

360
00:39:52,927 --> 00:39:55,395
Will it be broadcast in France?

361
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:59,157
Do people in France think
it's scary to come here?

362
00:40:01,927 --> 00:40:04,919
For example, do you feel
unsafe working here?

363
00:40:05,087 --> 00:40:06,156
Yes.

364
00:40:08,527 --> 00:40:12,440
Have you ever found yourself
standing next to a bus?

365
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:16,398
When you stand next to a bus,
pray for the light to be green.

366
00:40:16,567 --> 00:40:18,159
That's what I do.

367
00:40:19,407 --> 00:40:22,205
It can catch you,
it can catch anybody.

368
00:47:07,607 --> 00:47:11,077
We are at the Akerstein factory
in Yeruham.

369
00:47:11,447 --> 00:47:14,359
A factory founded in 1980,

370
00:47:14,607 --> 00:47:16,598
that manufactures concrete products.

371
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:21,079
Over the years,
our product line has become

372
00:47:21,527 --> 00:47:25,839
increasingly complex
and sophisticated.

373
00:47:26,527 --> 00:47:29,325
We manufacture fortified walls

374
00:47:29,487 --> 00:47:32,923
in different shapes and sizes,
of various types of concrete,

375
00:47:33,087 --> 00:47:36,602
depending on the degree
of fortification required.

376
00:47:36,847 --> 00:47:41,284
We also produce watchtowers
for use in the seam-zone.

377
00:47:42,407 --> 00:47:46,923
We developed these towers
over the past few years,

378
00:47:47,687 --> 00:47:49,803
in accordance with
the army's needs,

379
00:47:49,967 --> 00:47:52,037
together with the
security officials

380
00:47:52,207 --> 00:47:55,597
who deal with such matters.

381
00:47:56,967 --> 00:47:59,401
What's in these towers?

382
00:47:59,887 --> 00:48:04,517
At the entrance,
there's an armored door

383
00:48:04,687 --> 00:48:08,043
and an external staircase
for access.

384
00:48:08,327 --> 00:48:12,923
Inside,
a spiral staircase leads

385
00:48:13,287 --> 00:48:15,847
to the operations floor.

386
00:48:16,007 --> 00:48:18,919
In some watchtowers,

387
00:48:19,087 --> 00:48:22,238
there are folding beds
on the ground floor

388
00:48:22,407 --> 00:48:27,117
so two soldiers can sleep

389
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:30,365
while a third stands guard.

390
00:48:30,687 --> 00:48:34,839
On the operations floor,
where the guard is,

391
00:48:35,167 --> 00:48:40,605
the windows offer
a 360° field of vision.

392
00:48:40,767 --> 00:48:43,645
In some watchtowers,
there's a rotating chair,

393
00:48:43,807 --> 00:48:49,279
so the soldier can sit
as he observes,

394
00:48:49,447 --> 00:48:51,722
without getting tired.

395
00:48:51,887 --> 00:48:54,481
He can put his equipment
on the floor

396
00:48:54,647 --> 00:48:56,797
and rotate unobstructed.

397
00:48:56,967 --> 00:49:01,882
There are shooting holes and
special barrels for weapons.

398
00:49:02,447 --> 00:49:05,803
There's an armored exit
in the ceiling

399
00:49:05,967 --> 00:49:09,277
and a folding ladder to
reach the tower's roof.

400
00:49:09,527 --> 00:49:13,406
On the roof there's a projector

401
00:49:13,567 --> 00:49:17,526
that's activated from inside
but lights outside.

402
00:49:18,527 --> 00:49:23,043
Downstairs we can install
chemical toilets,

403
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:25,716
and running water,

404
00:49:25,967 --> 00:49:29,516
so the soldiers can drink
and wash their hands.

405
00:49:29,767 --> 00:49:32,486
Some of the towers
have air-conditioning

406
00:49:32,647 --> 00:49:36,925
so the soldiers can pass
both summer and winter

407
00:49:37,447 --> 00:49:40,166
in maximal comfort.

408
00:50:06,287 --> 00:50:08,039
Why are you filming?

409
00:50:08,407 --> 00:50:10,045
We're filming the fence.

410
00:50:10,687 --> 00:50:12,837
- What for?
- It's a film.

411
00:50:13,367 --> 00:50:16,120
You're not from the Municipality?

412
00:50:16,287 --> 00:50:18,926
It's not a public service?

413
00:50:19,087 --> 00:50:22,443
I thought you might help us.

414
00:50:22,807 --> 00:50:24,957
We're in Jerusalem here.

415
00:50:25,127 --> 00:50:28,722
But there's no buses
nor garbage pickup.

416
00:50:28,887 --> 00:50:30,320
Nothing.

417
00:50:30,487 --> 00:50:34,924
We pay municipal taxes,
we pay everything,

418
00:50:35,087 --> 00:50:36,839
but get nothing in return.

419
00:50:41,087 --> 00:50:42,884
Are you recording me?

420
00:50:43,767 --> 00:50:45,200
Thank you.

421
00:50:47,607 --> 00:50:51,361
Before they built the fence,
did you pass through there?

422
00:50:52,287 --> 00:50:56,075
We'd catch the bus up in Gilo.
But it was difficult.

423
00:50:56,247 --> 00:50:58,920
Look, we have to climb!
And now, it's dangerous.

424
00:50:59,087 --> 00:51:01,237
If a soldier spots me,

425
00:51:01,407 --> 00:51:04,843
he'll talk to me rudely,
he'll mistreat me.

426
00:51:05,007 --> 00:51:08,716
It's dangerous.
It's unfair!

427
00:51:08,887 --> 00:51:10,957
We spoke to the officer.

428
00:51:11,727 --> 00:51:14,321
There used to be a captain,

429
00:51:14,767 --> 00:51:16,758
Captain Raz.

430
00:51:17,047 --> 00:51:18,765
Now, it's Captain...

431
00:51:20,367 --> 00:51:23,723
I've forgotten his name.
Youvil?

432
00:51:25,007 --> 00:51:26,838
No. Ofir, maybe.

433
00:51:27,007 --> 00:51:29,726
He's an officer who
knows the area well

434
00:51:30,047 --> 00:51:31,765
and we told him:

435
00:51:31,927 --> 00:51:34,600
''Explain to the soldiers
that we belong to Jerusalem.

436
00:51:34,767 --> 00:51:39,682
''We shouldn't have to
pass through the checkpoint''.

437
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:41,565
They should give us a road!

438
00:51:41,727 --> 00:51:45,197
We talked and talked,
asking for direct access.

439
00:51:45,367 --> 00:51:47,005
But no one responded.

440
00:51:47,167 --> 00:51:48,361
We talked for nothing.

441
00:51:49,527 --> 00:51:51,404
- What's your name?
- Cecile.

442
00:51:54,847 --> 00:51:56,803
- It's a French name!
- Perhaps.

443
00:51:56,967 --> 00:51:59,925
My father, may God grant you
a life as long as his,

444
00:52:00,087 --> 00:52:04,285
named his 3 daughters
Cecile, Angele, Lucie.

445
00:52:55,687 --> 00:52:59,316
I am Sharif Omar,
a farmer from Jayyous.

446
00:53:00,367 --> 00:53:01,846
I'm 60 years old.

447
00:53:02,647 --> 00:53:05,207
I have four daughters
and three sons.

448
00:53:05,647 --> 00:53:08,480
All of them have
university degrees

449
00:53:09,167 --> 00:53:11,761
thanks to the income from my land.

450
00:53:12,367 --> 00:53:15,518
Today, I fear the Israelis
will take my land away.

451
00:53:18,127 --> 00:53:21,563
I have 2,700 trees
on the other side of the fence.

452
00:53:24,447 --> 00:53:26,324
Citrus, olives,

453
00:53:26,967 --> 00:53:29,561
hazelnuts, loquats,

454
00:53:31,447 --> 00:53:33,278
grapevines, apples,

455
00:53:33,727 --> 00:53:36,195
apricots, plums, avocados,

456
00:53:36,367 --> 00:53:40,280
mangos, pears, figs,
and walnuts.

457
00:53:42,007 --> 00:53:44,965
Palestine is Allah's paradise.

458
00:53:45,127 --> 00:53:46,799
If we get rid of the occupation,

459
00:53:46,967 --> 00:53:49,640
this heaven on earth
will suffice.

460
00:54:10,047 --> 00:54:12,641
The Israeli army claims
that the fence

461
00:54:12,807 --> 00:54:15,605
will guarantee the security
of both peoples.

462
00:54:15,767 --> 00:54:17,678
I don't see how.

463
00:54:17,847 --> 00:54:21,396
It's not being built
on the Green Line

464
00:54:21,567 --> 00:54:23,956
which we see
as a political boundary.

465
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:27,881
They push the fence
6 kilometers into Jayyous.

466
00:54:28,247 --> 00:54:30,124
How can it provide security?

467
00:54:30,407 --> 00:54:34,923
They dig 28 meters
from our homes.

468
00:54:35,407 --> 00:54:39,286
''To prevent the touch
between the two peoples'', they say.

469
00:54:39,447 --> 00:54:42,723
If 6 kilometers
don't guarantee security,

470
00:54:42,887 --> 00:54:45,162
how can 28 meters?

471
00:54:45,327 --> 00:54:46,760
It's a big lie.

472
00:54:46,927 --> 00:54:50,556
The truth is
they want to expropriate our land.

473
00:54:50,727 --> 00:54:53,764
It's a biased way to get us

474
00:54:54,367 --> 00:54:57,200
to abandon our villages.

475
00:54:57,367 --> 00:54:59,005
If they take our land

476
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:03,206
and leave us
with nothing to make a living,

477
00:55:03,367 --> 00:55:06,325
we'll have to go elsewhere
to provide for our families.

478
00:55:06,487 --> 00:55:08,717
It's expulsion in disguise

479
00:55:08,887 --> 00:55:10,605
so the world can continue

480
00:55:10,767 --> 00:55:12,917
to praise Israel

481
00:55:13,087 --> 00:55:14,964
and treat us like terrorists.

482
00:56:06,727 --> 00:56:10,083
Let's clarify some terms

483
00:56:10,247 --> 00:56:12,807
that I get lost with.

484
00:56:12,967 --> 00:56:15,003
You say: ''seam-zone''.

485
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:16,839
Others say: ''security fence,''

486
00:56:17,007 --> 00:56:18,838
''separation fence,''

487
00:56:19,007 --> 00:56:21,362
or ''separation wall''.

488
00:56:22,407 --> 00:56:24,637
I don't know
what to call it anymore.

489
00:56:24,807 --> 00:56:27,605
Don't exaggerate.

490
00:56:28,127 --> 00:56:31,119
All these terms are similar.

491
00:56:31,527 --> 00:56:33,722
They all describe

492
00:56:35,607 --> 00:56:38,724
the same situation
and similar means.

493
00:56:39,087 --> 00:56:40,759
What is a ''seam''?

494
00:56:41,327 --> 00:56:45,320
The seam is the line

495
00:56:45,687 --> 00:56:48,599
that passes between

496
00:56:49,207 --> 00:56:52,040
the Palestinian population

497
00:56:52,207 --> 00:56:55,882
and the Israeli population.

498
00:56:57,367 --> 00:57:00,916
That's the seam,
the line that separates.

499
00:57:01,607 --> 00:57:04,041
- Is it the Green Line?
- More or less!

500
00:57:04,767 --> 00:57:07,645
It's the Green Line,
where there are no settlements.

501
00:57:08,247 --> 00:57:09,805
And it...

502
00:57:11,887 --> 00:57:13,559
It passes

503
00:57:13,727 --> 00:57:16,958
inward of the Green Line
where there are settlements.

504
00:57:17,607 --> 00:57:21,646
All these terms
describe the same thing,

505
00:57:22,087 --> 00:57:26,160
what I conveyed before:

506
00:57:26,327 --> 00:57:31,606
a means to obstruct
terrorist penetration.

507
00:57:31,767 --> 00:57:33,598
What do you call it?

508
00:57:34,247 --> 00:57:37,683
I call it the obstacle line,
the obstacle,

509
00:57:39,047 --> 00:57:41,038
the fence.

510
00:57:45,007 --> 00:57:47,567
One need not get ideological

511
00:57:47,727 --> 00:57:52,084
about the different names
this obstacle has.

512
00:58:20,047 --> 00:58:23,403
Why is there a concrete wall
in some places,

513
00:58:23,567 --> 00:58:27,799
like Qalqilya or Tulkarm,

514
00:58:28,247 --> 00:58:30,841
while in other places
there's an electronic fence?

515
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:34,044
What's the difference?

516
00:58:34,487 --> 00:58:37,240
Where you see concrete walls

517
00:58:37,407 --> 00:58:40,638
it's to protect the people
living or driving near the line

518
00:58:40,807 --> 00:58:44,800
from gunfire.

519
00:58:45,247 --> 00:58:47,477
This is where we put
concrete walls.

520
00:58:47,647 --> 00:58:51,276
Elsewhere, in most cases,
we erect a fence.

521
00:58:51,447 --> 00:58:58,125
In Qalqilya and Tulkarm,
the wall protects cars

522
00:58:58,287 --> 00:58:59,800
on the Trans-Israel Highway

523
00:58:59,967 --> 00:59:04,438
from gunfire coming from
Qalqilya and Tulkarm.

524
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:39,045
My name is Muli Peleg.

525
00:59:39,207 --> 00:59:42,483
I live with my wife
and 2 daughters

526
00:59:42,647 --> 00:59:46,526
in Matan,
along the seam-line,

527
00:59:46,727 --> 00:59:49,195
next to a Palestinian village.

528
00:59:49,367 --> 00:59:51,881
Matan and Habla
are separated by a wall.

529
00:59:52,087 --> 00:59:54,681
We moved here by chance
about 7 years ago.

530
00:59:54,847 --> 00:59:59,716
We wanted to raise the girls
outside the city,

531
01:00:00,847 --> 01:00:02,838
in the open space and fresh air.

532
01:00:12,527 --> 01:00:15,758
That same year,
they built the wall.

533
01:00:15,967 --> 01:00:17,878
You must have seen it.

534
01:00:18,047 --> 01:00:20,880
I tried through various means

535
01:00:21,727 --> 01:00:24,605
to make contact
with the other side.

536
01:00:24,807 --> 01:00:26,604
There are people living
on the other side,

537
01:00:26,887 --> 01:00:29,082
and I wanted to get to know them

538
01:00:29,247 --> 01:00:31,397
as neighbours.

539
01:00:31,647 --> 01:00:34,320
Impossible!
There were these walls,

540
01:00:34,487 --> 01:00:37,206
and definitions,
and categories:

541
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:38,959
Israeli Jews here,

542
01:00:39,127 --> 01:00:41,925
Palestinians there.
And no access.

543
01:00:44,247 --> 01:00:46,966
A few years later,
in the summer of 2000,

544
01:00:47,127 --> 01:00:50,403
an opportunity presented itself.

545
01:00:50,567 --> 01:00:52,239
Fate intervened.

546
01:00:53,287 --> 01:00:56,165
I don't believe in fate,
but something happened.

547
01:00:57,167 --> 01:01:00,603
A human-interest story,
well publicized at the time.

548
01:01:01,727 --> 01:01:03,763
A young man from Habla,

549
01:01:04,367 --> 01:01:07,723
was vacationing
on Lake Tiberius.

550
01:01:08,287 --> 01:01:09,959
While swimming in the lake,

551
01:01:10,127 --> 01:01:12,277
he noticed 2 Jewish children

552
01:01:12,447 --> 01:01:14,836
drowning nearby.

553
01:01:15,207 --> 01:01:17,846
He jumped in to save them

554
01:01:18,007 --> 01:01:19,963
but drowned himself, and died.

555
01:01:21,407 --> 01:01:25,878
This heroic, universal story
that traverses cultural boundaries

556
01:01:26,367 --> 01:01:28,722
and walls of hatred,

557
01:01:29,447 --> 01:01:32,007
was an occasion to reach out

558
01:01:32,167 --> 01:01:37,116
to the people of Habla,
something I was longing for.

559
01:01:42,367 --> 01:01:45,404
I suggested to the members
of our municipal council

560
01:01:45,567 --> 01:01:49,355
that we make a human gesture:

561
01:01:49,847 --> 01:01:54,523
pay our condolences to the
bereaved Odeh family in Habla.

562
01:01:55,767 --> 01:01:58,884
It wasn't easy to convince them.

563
01:02:00,007 --> 01:02:04,637
But I was determined,
and eventually succeeded.

564
01:02:05,687 --> 01:02:08,724
We put together a delegation
and went there.

565
01:02:10,607 --> 01:02:14,919
We crossed a physical distance
of 5 minutes,

566
01:02:15,087 --> 01:02:18,477
but a psychological distance
of hours, if not days.

567
01:02:19,727 --> 01:02:22,560
There,
I made a strong connection

568
01:02:22,727 --> 01:02:24,957
with Nabil,

569
01:02:25,127 --> 01:02:28,164
the mayor of the village,

570
01:02:28,327 --> 01:02:30,887
and Luai, his assistant.

571
01:02:31,167 --> 01:02:34,842
That was on September 20th.

572
01:02:36,727 --> 01:02:39,116
Six days later,
the Intifada erupted.

573
01:02:39,327 --> 01:02:42,558
Ariel Sharon went
to the Temple Mount,

574
01:02:42,807 --> 01:02:45,037
and all hell broke loose.

575
01:02:59,087 --> 01:03:02,045
Hello Nabil, hello Luai.
How are you?

576
01:03:03,127 --> 01:03:06,403
Our phone conversations
are not enough.

577
01:03:06,567 --> 01:03:09,559
I'd like us to meet

578
01:03:09,727 --> 01:03:12,685
and continue making plans.

579
01:03:13,807 --> 01:03:16,719
I'd like to host you here.

580
01:03:16,887 --> 01:03:21,244
You live so close, sometimes
I can hear you beyond the wall.

581
01:03:22,327 --> 01:03:26,479
I'd really like us to meet.

582
01:03:27,487 --> 01:03:31,765
Talk, watch movies together,

583
01:03:32,367 --> 01:03:35,120
go to the swimming pool nearby.

584
01:03:36,287 --> 01:03:39,404
Share meals.
It would be great.

585
01:03:39,567 --> 01:03:43,560
And I'm sure
that one day we will.

586
01:03:43,727 --> 01:03:46,366
Stay strong,
and we'll build our future together

587
01:03:46,527 --> 01:03:49,519
like good neighbours
in any normal place.

588
01:04:44,367 --> 01:04:46,722
- You want to get across?
- Yes, to Qalqilya.

589
01:04:47,007 --> 01:04:48,759
Is there a passageway?

590
01:04:49,127 --> 01:04:52,756
Yes, but soon
they're going to close it.

591
01:04:53,287 --> 01:04:55,847
- Do you cross on horseback?
- Yes.

592
01:04:57,447 --> 01:04:59,756
I've been waiting for 2 hours,

593
01:04:59,927 --> 01:05:01,645
but they're watching us.

594
01:05:01,807 --> 01:05:03,877
- This jeep here?
- Yes.

595
01:05:04,487 --> 01:05:06,478
When they leave, we'll pass.

596
01:05:06,647 --> 01:05:08,365
What did she say?

597
01:05:08,527 --> 01:05:10,995
I'm telling her
we want to go to Qalqilya.

598
01:05:11,167 --> 01:05:13,522
Yes, but the army's there.

599
01:05:13,887 --> 01:05:17,243
They've cut us off
from the world.

600
01:05:20,247 --> 01:05:21,999
Here they come!

601
01:05:25,567 --> 01:05:28,001
- Where do you live?
- Qalqilya.

602
01:05:28,167 --> 01:05:32,797
But now, we can't cross
to go to work everyday,

603
01:05:32,967 --> 01:05:35,481
so I rented a house in Habla.

604
01:05:36,927 --> 01:05:39,157
Take the horse and tie him there.

605
01:05:44,727 --> 01:05:46,797
Go and tie the horse!

606
01:05:51,527 --> 01:05:53,245
Don't cross now, it's dangerous.

607
01:05:53,407 --> 01:05:55,079
I know. I'll wait.

608
01:05:57,167 --> 01:05:59,840
- Here they come.
- Move back!

609
01:06:01,287 --> 01:06:03,084
Are they coming to shoot at us?

610
01:06:03,247 --> 01:06:04,680
Are they going to shoot?

611
01:06:50,647 --> 01:06:52,478
It is 5 in the morning.

612
01:06:52,647 --> 01:06:56,640
People are arriving,
workers mainly,

613
01:06:57,207 --> 01:06:59,926
to cross into Jerusalem
clandestinely.

614
01:07:00,487 --> 01:07:02,955
They come in waves.

615
01:07:11,047 --> 01:07:14,960
The mini-buses
used to take that dirt road.

616
01:07:15,367 --> 01:07:19,918
But the army has blocked it
with a wrecked car and rubble.

617
01:07:20,167 --> 01:07:23,716
Now people have to walk.
It takes them 45 minutes

618
01:07:24,127 --> 01:07:28,120
to reach Silwan
in the valley below.

619
01:07:28,447 --> 01:07:32,326
From there, they catch taxis
to Bethlehem and Jerusalem.

620
01:07:40,527 --> 01:07:43,200
This area used to be tranquil,

621
01:07:44,247 --> 01:07:45,999
a very calm neighbourhood.

622
01:07:46,167 --> 01:07:47,998
And look what's happened!

623
01:07:48,167 --> 01:07:50,840
It has become a crossroads.

624
01:07:51,007 --> 01:07:54,886
From the South, North, and center,
everyone passes through here.

625
01:07:55,327 --> 01:07:58,285
Our children direct the people:

626
01:07:58,447 --> 01:08:00,642
This way to Jerusalem,
that way to Bethlehem.

627
01:08:00,887 --> 01:08:05,244
They give out water and Cola
to the thirsty and elderly.

628
01:08:05,767 --> 01:08:08,884
We could sell pumpkin seeds
and pop-corn.

629
01:08:09,047 --> 01:08:10,480
Do business!

630
01:08:46,287 --> 01:08:49,962
When it rains,
they trek through the mud.

631
01:08:50,127 --> 01:08:52,641
All this turns to mud.

632
01:08:53,087 --> 01:08:56,045
But people must,
if they want to earn a living.

633
01:10:00,687 --> 01:10:03,247
You're filming the security fence?

634
01:10:04,887 --> 01:10:06,639
Walls are everywhere now!

635
01:10:08,647 --> 01:10:10,444
It continues up that way,

636
01:10:11,967 --> 01:10:14,162
though it's not finished yet.

637
01:10:19,007 --> 01:10:20,998
What do you see from your house?

638
01:10:21,167 --> 01:10:22,725
I see the whole area.

639
01:10:28,367 --> 01:10:30,437
Everything that happens here.

640
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:34,564
I see how people
climb through the hills.

641
01:11:09,687 --> 01:11:11,757
Arabic? Hebrew?

642
01:11:11,927 --> 01:11:13,121
As you like.

643
01:11:17,167 --> 01:11:18,725
What's your question?

644
01:11:18,887 --> 01:11:20,366
No question.

645
01:11:21,407 --> 01:11:23,921
The question is what you see:

646
01:11:24,087 --> 01:11:28,160
they've closed off the West Bank
once again.

647
01:11:28,327 --> 01:11:30,158
I also have to walk.

648
01:11:30,327 --> 01:11:33,000
Everyday, I walk 5 kilometers.

649
01:11:34,127 --> 01:11:36,595
And I'm 50 years old,
not young.

650
01:11:38,527 --> 01:11:41,564
The checkpoints are closed,
Ramallah is closed.

651
01:11:41,727 --> 01:11:45,276
Anata is closed.
It's like a curfew.

652
01:11:45,647 --> 01:11:48,320
We no longer know
how to feed our families.

653
01:11:48,807 --> 01:11:51,685
Some of my children work in Israel.

654
01:11:51,847 --> 01:11:54,156
They have Jerusalem ID cards,
but I don't.

655
01:11:56,247 --> 01:11:58,158
My wife has a Jerusalem ID.

656
01:11:58,327 --> 01:12:01,160
Half my children too,
the others have West Bank IDs.

657
01:12:02,647 --> 01:12:04,399
Half and half!

658
01:13:34,727 --> 01:13:37,719
I am Shuli Dichter,
a member of kibbutz Maanit.

659
01:13:38,047 --> 01:13:41,801
I'm not a security guard.
I just borrowed this Jeep

660
01:13:42,087 --> 01:13:44,999
to take you to the fence.

661
01:13:45,167 --> 01:13:47,522
It's the only way to get there.

662
01:14:23,287 --> 01:14:25,517
We are heading East.

663
01:14:26,967 --> 01:14:28,764
From here eastward,

664
01:14:29,807 --> 01:14:34,437
until 1942, there were
no Jewish settlements.

665
01:14:35,167 --> 01:14:38,716
The entire region was
populated by Palestinians.

666
01:14:39,727 --> 01:14:43,197
In the early 1940s

667
01:14:43,687 --> 01:14:46,076
the Jews started coming.

668
01:14:47,287 --> 01:14:51,439
Maanit, my kibbutz,
was the first kibbutz

669
01:14:52,047 --> 01:14:54,515
to be wedged in between

670
01:14:54,967 --> 01:14:58,801
the Palestinians
of Baqa al-Gharbiye, Jat

671
01:14:58,967 --> 01:15:00,798
and Wadi Ara.

672
01:15:01,167 --> 01:15:04,239
Maanit means ''row'',

673
01:15:04,567 --> 01:15:06,398
the first row in the field.

674
01:15:06,567 --> 01:15:10,685
For it was the first row of Jews

675
01:15:10,847 --> 01:15:13,202
to settle this far to the East,

676
01:15:14,007 --> 01:15:17,443
in the foothills of Samaria.
Just like settlers!

677
01:15:23,047 --> 01:15:26,323
Now we are entering
the area of the fence.

678
01:15:26,487 --> 01:15:28,523
We passed the Green Line

679
01:15:28,927 --> 01:15:31,885
about 200 meters back.

680
01:15:32,287 --> 01:15:34,005
We're in the West Bank.

681
01:15:35,367 --> 01:15:38,040
This village, Qafin,

682
01:15:39,567 --> 01:15:43,355
has been severed from all its land
by the fence.

683
01:15:45,727 --> 01:15:49,481
After being enclosed on all sides,
over the past 2 years,

684
01:15:50,527 --> 01:15:54,520
they've got nothing to live from,
other than these olive trees.

685
01:15:56,767 --> 01:16:01,363
All they've got left
are these olives.

686
01:16:01,527 --> 01:16:05,839
The trees on this side
are now inaccessible.

687
01:16:06,007 --> 01:16:09,920
The gates, the permits,
we know it's bullshit.

688
01:16:10,127 --> 01:16:14,723
This year, in the West Bank,
the olives rotted on the trees.

689
01:16:15,087 --> 01:16:16,839
They couldn't pick them.

690
01:16:19,087 --> 01:16:22,602
And olives are Qafin's
only source of livelihood.

691
01:16:32,807 --> 01:16:35,275
Closure and enclosure...

692
01:16:38,207 --> 01:16:41,517
are the cornerstones
of our lives here.

693
01:16:42,727 --> 01:16:44,524
Our parents in Maanit

694
01:16:45,167 --> 01:16:48,682
came here from the shtetls
and ghettos of Lodz.

695
01:16:49,527 --> 01:16:52,325
Their entire lives
were spent in closure!

696
01:16:54,767 --> 01:16:59,283
It was a love story
between us and this land.

697
01:16:59,607 --> 01:17:01,962
A real love story.

698
01:17:02,287 --> 01:17:04,755
I say this as someone
who grew up here,

699
01:17:04,927 --> 01:17:08,886
who knows and loves
every rock in these hills.

700
01:17:11,447 --> 01:17:13,881
But it was a mad love,

701
01:17:14,487 --> 01:17:15,966
a possessive love,

702
01:17:16,927 --> 01:17:19,122
the kind that seizes all.

703
01:17:24,367 --> 01:17:27,518
What is so terrible
about this separation fence,

704
01:17:29,127 --> 01:17:31,163
is that it's consensual.

705
01:17:32,007 --> 01:17:35,920
In other words,
all the Jews in Israel

706
01:17:36,327 --> 01:17:38,477
have lost their minds!

707
01:17:38,727 --> 01:17:43,005
We love this land so much
that we seal it.

708
01:17:44,087 --> 01:17:46,601
It's a post-modern interpretation

709
01:17:46,767 --> 01:17:50,885
of the saying:
''Let me die with the Philistines''.

710
01:17:52,807 --> 01:17:56,243
Commit suicide
with the Palestinians.

711
01:17:56,407 --> 01:17:58,284
Take them with us to our death.

712
01:18:06,807 --> 01:18:08,559
What more can I say?

713
01:18:08,727 --> 01:18:12,481
This fence blocks the artery
that feeds the Israeli heart.

714
01:18:13,407 --> 01:18:19,277
If there was some kind of osmosis,
deranged as it may have been,

715
01:18:19,447 --> 01:18:21,517
between us and the Palestinians,

716
01:18:21,687 --> 01:18:23,279
if there was some chance

717
01:18:23,447 --> 01:18:26,200
that we would integrate
into this region,

718
01:18:26,367 --> 01:18:28,562
that Zionism would flourish,

719
01:18:29,007 --> 01:18:32,682
that the Jewish people
would have a home in this world,

720
01:18:33,727 --> 01:18:36,525
this fence
has eliminated that possibility.

721
01:18:38,727 --> 01:18:41,446
It reminds me of that poem
I told you about,

722
01:18:41,847 --> 01:18:43,917
by Rachel the poet.

723
01:18:44,087 --> 01:18:47,682
Her love for her man

724
01:18:48,007 --> 01:18:50,646
was so insane

725
01:18:50,807 --> 01:18:52,718
that she wrote a suicidal poem

726
01:18:54,047 --> 01:18:55,924
that read:

727
01:18:56,167 --> 01:19:00,285
''I shall lock the doors to my heart

728
01:19:00,727 --> 01:19:03,525
''And cast the key into the sea

729
01:19:03,687 --> 01:19:06,804
''My heart shall know no more dread

730
01:19:07,047 --> 01:19:09,402
''Upon hearing you approach''.

731
01:19:11,007 --> 01:19:13,441
And she ends the poem thus:

732
01:19:13,647 --> 01:19:17,435
''I have but one consolation

733
01:19:17,687 --> 01:19:19,837
''That I have brought this
upon myself''.

734
01:19:20,007 --> 01:19:22,805
So sarcastic, so terrible!

735
01:19:23,567 --> 01:19:28,243
So cynical!
It's beyond irony.

736
01:19:28,767 --> 01:19:30,325
It's cynicism.

737
01:19:30,487 --> 01:19:33,285
So as to console ourselves
for killing ourselves,

738
01:19:33,447 --> 01:19:34,766
we'll write in history books

739
01:19:34,927 --> 01:19:38,078
that we brought it
upon ourselves.

740
01:19:38,247 --> 01:19:40,158
That will be our sole consolation.

741
01:19:42,247 --> 01:19:44,124
Shuli, are you despaired?

742
01:19:44,767 --> 01:19:47,281
Were I despaired
I wouldn't be here.

743
01:19:47,847 --> 01:19:49,963
Were I despaired
I wouldn't talk.

744
01:19:51,807 --> 01:19:54,321
Silence frightens me most.

745
01:19:56,847 --> 01:19:59,725
Desperate people keep silent.

746
01:20:00,207 --> 01:20:02,038
I'm not despaired.

747
01:20:02,207 --> 01:20:03,526
I'm fighting.

748
01:20:13,087 --> 01:20:14,645
One last question.

749
01:20:14,807 --> 01:20:16,843
The fence harms the environment.

750
01:20:17,007 --> 01:20:20,716
It damages and destroys everything.

751
01:20:20,887 --> 01:20:24,482
Severe ecological problems
are expected.

752
01:20:24,647 --> 01:20:26,239
What do you have to say?

753
01:20:26,407 --> 01:20:30,366
It's true,
the fence harms the environment.

754
01:20:30,527 --> 01:20:35,282
Any artificial intervention
in nature causes damage.

755
01:20:35,847 --> 01:20:38,566
We are doing all we can

756
01:20:38,727 --> 01:20:42,117
to minimize the damage.

757
01:20:42,287 --> 01:20:46,121
The planners took this
into consideration.

758
01:20:46,607 --> 01:20:49,883
We have been in regular contact

759
01:20:50,047 --> 01:20:51,924
with the Nature Reserves Authority,

760
01:20:52,087 --> 01:20:55,523
and associations for
the protection of the environment.

761
01:20:55,687 --> 01:20:59,805
We try to cause
as little harm as possible.

762
01:20:59,967 --> 01:21:02,959
We also try to rehabilitate.

763
01:21:03,127 --> 01:21:06,039
Where we cause too much damage,

764
01:21:06,207 --> 01:21:09,165
we try to repair.

765
01:21:09,327 --> 01:21:10,521
On both sides?

766
01:21:10,687 --> 01:21:12,120
On both sides.

767
01:21:12,287 --> 01:21:14,437
On our side and the other side.

768
01:21:14,607 --> 01:21:18,805
First of all,
we see both sides as ours!

769
01:21:18,967 --> 01:21:22,004
Right now, we are the rulers.

770
01:21:22,167 --> 01:21:26,365
We see no difference between
this side or that.

771
01:21:26,527 --> 01:21:28,085
We do our best.

772
01:21:28,247 --> 01:21:30,477
But I won't deny it,
it causes damage.

773
01:21:30,647 --> 01:21:34,435
It's all the Palestinians' fault.

774
01:21:34,607 --> 01:21:38,600
They've been fighting with us
for 100 years now.

775
01:21:38,767 --> 01:21:41,964
They never miss an opportunity
to keep on fighting.

776
01:21:42,127 --> 01:21:44,163
They've done nothing

777
01:21:44,327 --> 01:21:47,842
to come to the negotiating table.

778
01:21:48,327 --> 01:21:52,240
We've demonstrated good will,
in the present and in the past.

779
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:55,843
They must sit down with us

780
01:21:56,007 --> 01:21:59,124
to negotiate a viable solution.

781
01:21:59,287 --> 01:22:02,518
No solution?
Everyone will suffer.

782
01:22:02,687 --> 01:22:05,360
We are sufficiently strong
to endure suffering.

783
01:22:05,527 --> 01:22:07,404
I don't wish it to be so,

784
01:22:07,567 --> 01:22:09,762
and I'll do everything
to avoid it,

785
01:22:09,927 --> 01:22:13,966
but if they refuse
to compromise,

786
01:22:14,127 --> 01:22:16,038
they will suffer more.

787
01:22:18,287 --> 01:22:19,959
Thank you very much.

788
01:22:22,567 --> 01:22:23,602
Thanks.

789
01:22:59,207 --> 01:23:00,481
We're ready!

790
01:23:02,647 --> 01:23:04,080
Welcome!

791
01:23:05,087 --> 01:23:06,600
Good to see you, Simone!

792
01:23:10,927 --> 01:23:12,246
I'm well, thank God.

793
01:23:12,727 --> 01:23:16,481
I'm happy to see you
on this screen.

794
01:23:17,407 --> 01:23:19,716
I am in Gaza
and you are in Ramallah.

795
01:23:20,367 --> 01:23:23,962
I wish we could be together

796
01:23:24,127 --> 01:23:27,802
in Ramallah, Gaza,
Jerusalem or Tel Aviv.

797
01:23:29,767 --> 01:23:33,965
But regretfully,
the current situation

798
01:23:34,127 --> 01:23:37,483
prohibits friends from meeting.

799
01:23:38,767 --> 01:23:41,679
Gaza has become a big prison,

800
01:23:41,847 --> 01:23:45,965
surrounded by barbed wire

801
01:23:48,887 --> 01:23:50,878
and electronic fences

802
01:23:51,807 --> 01:23:53,638
on all sides,

803
01:23:53,847 --> 01:23:57,522
and closed off by the sea
to the West.

804
01:23:58,087 --> 01:23:59,839
It is a big prison,

805
01:24:00,247 --> 01:24:04,684
in which nobody is safe,

806
01:24:04,847 --> 01:24:07,441
because it's a prison
without a roof.

807
01:24:09,767 --> 01:24:12,235
The missiles can strike
at any moment,

808
01:24:12,407 --> 01:24:14,682
at any house.

809
01:24:15,847 --> 01:24:19,044
The worst phenomenon today

810
01:24:21,447 --> 01:24:25,645
is that 24% of Gazan youths -

811
01:24:26,407 --> 01:24:29,160
and this is true
for the West Bank too -

812
01:24:29,647 --> 01:24:32,525
wish to become martyrs.

813
01:24:33,407 --> 01:24:37,798
24% wish to die
in suicide operations.

814
01:24:38,927 --> 01:24:40,679
It's a terrible sign.

815
01:24:40,847 --> 01:24:45,045
Some people consider
such acts heroic.

816
01:24:45,647 --> 01:24:49,925
It gives them pride.
But as a psychiatrist,

817
01:24:50,087 --> 01:24:52,920
I think it's very dangerous
that a 12 year old

818
01:24:53,087 --> 01:24:57,080
wishes to be dead
by the time he turns 18.

819
01:27:36,767 --> 01:27:39,565
Film, brother!
Send us abroad.

820
01:27:39,727 --> 01:27:41,524
Show them how we jump!

821
01:29:29,287 --> 01:29:30,766
There is a God!
