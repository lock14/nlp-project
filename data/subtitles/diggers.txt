Good morning. Wanna Talk.
And here's your weather
for this fine Tuesday morning, 
September, 1976. 
Partly cloudy skies
will prevail
over the south shore
of Long Island, 
yielding to scattered sunshine
with a high of 62 degrees. 
Low is gonna be around 56
with winds coming
out of the southeast, 
gusting to 22 miles per hour. 
For all you fishermen
and boaters out there, 
high tide arrives today
at 8:51 a. m. , 9:15 p. m. , 
and low tides at 2:31 a. m. 
and 3:16 p. m. 
All right, for your commute
into work this morning, 
this is "Hold On To Freedom"
from Lee Michaels. 
* Hold on to freedom *
* Freedom's the only
Thing you have *
* Hold on to justice *
* Justice is
Your only lamp *
All right, all right.
* I saw the meaning *
* The meaning
In the sun, the sky *
* It said, "Lady, ring *
* You'd better just
Let it slide" *
* My life is for livin' *
* And livin' is for fun *
* So you'd better just
Change your mind *
* Change your mind
While you got one *
* Hold onto freedom *
* Freedom's the only
Thing you have *
* Hold onto justice *
* Justice is
Your biggest laugh *
* When they look
For something *
* And something
Looks for them *
* Just like a jungle *
* A jungle where
You've never been *
* Each day is filled
With changes *
* And each new change
Means a new day for me *
* So you'd better hold on *
* Hold on while you can see *
* Help me now *
* Whoo *
* Babe, whoo *
* Each day is filled with
With changes *
* And each change
Each change *
* Means a new day for me *
* So you'd better
Better hold *
* You'd better hold *
* You'd better hold on
While you see *
* Hold me now *
* Hold onto freedom, yeah *
* Hold onto justice, yeah *
* Hold on to your brother
Whoo *
* Hold onto everything
That means something to you *
* Something to you
Something to you *
* Something to you
Something to you *
That's the one.
Hey, Gina.
Hey, Mr. Wilson.
Hey, Hunt.
Lay off the reefer.
What?
Never touch the stuff.
You're late.
Am I?
Dad was here an hour ago
waiting for you.
Didn't ask him to.
No, but you know
he does, so...
why not show up?
Food please.
What do I look like,
your mother?
Starting to.
Shit. Really?
Come on, hurry up.
Be vain later.
Well, what do you want?
Decide.
No. Surprise me.
Eggs.
Old man likes
to get out early, huh?
Yeah, he has to. He's gettin'
old and slow. Oh, yeah.
And I'll have
two coffees.
One black,
three sugars.
For Dad?
Yeah.
Thought I'd use it
as a peace offering.
Do you believe this shit?
Jesus Christ,
South Shell fucks.
I tell you,
they're killin' us.
Black, three sugars.
Milk, one sugar.
Good luck in finding him.
That's all right.
We got a meeting place.
I know where he is.
It's nice. We don't
have to talk too much.
We're too far away
from each other.
That's how
we communicate best.
Yesterday the township leased
400 additional square acres
of the Great South Bay's
bottomland
to the South Shell fishery, 
a private corporation. 
That's bad news
for our local baymen. 
The harvesting of clams
in newly-restricted areas, 
pollution in the bay
and fewer shellfish--
--are adding to an already
arduous trade. 
South Shell warns that--
--entering restricted waters
will be ticketed and fined. 
B-4. 
Hit. J-1. 
Ha, you missed. 
J-10. 
Oh, you sunk my battleship!
Stay.
Battleship, a game of strategy
from Milton Bradley. 
* Don't lie to me *
* Don't lie to me *
* Don't lie to me *
* Don't lie to me *
* I know where you been *
What's going down, Jack?
Cons, Lisa.
Lisa, Cons.
Hi.
I certainly am.
Thank you.
That's why I'm here.
Anthony, go outside.
Daddy's having private time.
Daddy poop.
Julie.
What?
Julie!
I said what?
What the fuck
is going on down there?
Language. What?
Don't "what" me.
Keep the fucking kids
under control.
What?
Kids are running around
like monkeys,
running in here
when I'm in here.
So fix the lock.
Stop feeding them
sugar cereal.
Fucking...
I am not an octopus, Frankie.
I am not an octopus.
Bouncing off the walls.
I got two hands,
that's all I got.
Get off your brother.
Do me a favor. Keep 'em
outta here when I'm in here.
Would you do that
for me, please?
Fix the lock
and stop crying.
Crying? I'll fucking--
I'll break the fucking door,
Jesus Christ!
Julie, quick,
bring the camera.
Anthony's just like Daddy.
You're just like Daddy.
Now, that's--
That's very interesting.
All right.
Let me run this by him.
Let me-- Go out on a limb here.
Okay. Bye.
Come here.
Yeah, I know, I know.
I overslept.
Come on, give me
a break, right?
You like to get out early.
You know, look,
I brought you coffee, all right?
Sit down, we'll talk.
You can cool off.
I'm not telling you what to do.
No. I mean, every time--
Where are you?
Where are you?
Oh, no.
He looks ridiculous.
No, he doesn't.
It's what he got
married in, right?
Mom would have
liked it.
He looks, uh...
... handsome.
Yeah, well, that's one day
in Dad's life.
And that'sDad.
Okay, let's take off
his suit.
We'll leave him in there
in his dirty underwear.
Scotch in one hand
and the, uh...
And the TV Guide
in the other.
I can't lose Dad.
I know.
I don't care
if it's not fair,
I said no.
Why not?
No means no.
Your father said no,
that's it. In the car.
It's not fair.
Ralph saw it last summer,
and he's 7.
So why can't I see it now?
It's at the mall.
Hey, Frankie Jr. ,
lay off.
Because it's too scary,
you go see that shark movie--
It's called Jaws. 
I gotta pee.
Donna, take your brother inside.
The rest of you, in the car now.
I know what it's called,
smart ass, I saw it, okay?
You see that Jaws movie,
you'll be up all night
shaking in your Underoos,
which means I'll
be up all night,
which means
I'm not gonna sleep,
which means
you're not gonna see it!
Shark blows up in the end,
save your money.
All right,
what's up your hole now?
Look, can I just say
I'm the one
who's gonna be
chasing after the kids
because you wouldn't pay
for a sitter?
You don't bring kids
to a funeral, Frankie.
Who says?
You just don't.
Who just says?
Everybody just says,
except you.
That's who just says.
Oh, everybody just says?
I don't think
everybody just says.
You're a child,
you know that?
Oh! Oh! All right,
well, then by your rules,
I shouldn't be going
to the funeral, so...
Let's not go.
It was great.
It was really great.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.
Thank you.
Hey.
Hey.
Hi, Beth.
How you been doing?
I made you
a string-bean casserole.
I left it at your house.
Thank you, Beth,
but I think we should
stick with the original--
I-- I have to admit,
I called a couple times.
I'm bad.
I mean, it's not like
you pick up anyway, right?
Yeah.
Oh, look,
you got a little something
in your eye there.
Yeah, I got it.
Thank you. Thank you.
Well, hey...
Thanks for coming, Beth.
Thank you very much.
Nice that Beth came.
Yeah...
Beth is nice.
Shit.
What?
Shithead's here.
What the hell, Alan?
Gina, how are you?
Get out.
Jesus,
relax, Gina.
I'm just here
to pay my respects.
No. Get out. You're not part of
this family anymore, Alan.
We are not married
anymore. So...
get out.
I'm just--
You know,
I just wanna
pay my respects, man.
Fuck you, shithead.
Fellas.
Fuck you, shithead.
Wow.
She, uh, evolved.
Let's get happy.
Because it's important, Julie.
Kids need to know,
at the end of life, people die.
Babies, do you wanna
go to a funeral?
No.
Who wants to see a dead body?
I do, I do. Me, me!
I do.
I'm so sorry.
Yeah, me too.
Yeah. Yeah.
It's just that death
is so fucking severe.
Mm.
It's brutal.
It's man's final fate, man.
Fucker's grim.
It's Byzantine.
Byzantine?
Complex? Layered?
You know,
we're the only animal
that's conscious
of our own mortality.
Do you know how much
that fucks us up?
You know, Bronowski said,
"Every animal leaves traces
of what it was.
Man alone leaves traces
of what he created. "
Who said that?
Bronowski, the writer.
Who cares?
When you're dead, you're dead,
know what I mean?
I zoned out in the middle,
but I do agree
with the "when you're dead,
you're dead" part.
Yeah.
Hey. Ahem.
You wanna?
Oh.
It's not a bad time
to be numb.
All right.
Pick up your cans, Lozo.
Out, everybody out.
Out, out, out.
Let's go,
let's go, let's go.
Here, here.
Put this on.
Ties choke, no.
Lozo.
No.
Let's go,
triple time, let's go.
Triple time.
Don't run. Don't run.
I'm walking
as fast as I can.
I'm saying
they shouldn't run.
Hey, let your sister
open the door.
Over there, no noise.
Can we see his guts?
You wanna see my belt?
Go all the way
over there.
Donna, please watch
your brothers.
It's never good.
It's just never...
... good.
You brought your kids?
Hi.
Hey.
Thanks for coming.
Oh, of course.
Did they say
what happened?
Well,
his heart stopped,
he fell in the water,
but they don't know
what happened first.
South Shell killed him.
Oh, Frankie.
No, they fucking...
killed him, man.
He was out by himself. You can't
say South Shell killed him.
I can say
whatever I want.
I feel it, man.
I'm a young buck,
and I'm in
my fucking prime.
And I-- I feel
they're killing me.
I-I...
get what
you're saying, Loz,
But come on, this is the
old man's funeral, all right?
No, I know. I'm--
I'm sorry, no disrespect.
I loved
your old man, okay?
But it takes three days
to pull in a day's pay now,
and you can't tell me that
those South Shell cocksuckers
restricting our water's
got nothing to do
with your old man
being in a box.
Guys, guys, guys, guys...
No, hold on a second,
all right?
You don't see
the irony of it?
It's fucking ironic
is what it is.
What's ironic about it?
You don't...
see the irony?
You don't...
see the irony?
I'm trying to.
Actually the true
definition of irony--
Honestly, don't get wordy
with me right now.
Hey, it's not the time, Frankie.
Not the time.
Yeah, man. Dull that edge.
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
I don't think so.
Oh. Oh, really?
Okay, go ahead.
I'm sorry.
I didn't make his bed
that day.
Oh,
that's all right.
You can make it
tonight.
Yeah.
Boots?
Why?
* Heyla ho, boys *
* Let her go, boys *
* Bring her head round *
* Altogether *
* Heyla ho, boys *
* Let her go, boys *
* Sailing homeward *
* To Mingulay *
Can you pick up Daddy's ashes?
I don't think I can
handle it right now.
It's taken care of.
What about his boat?
I'll sell it, or...
I-I don't know.
You want me
to stay over?
No.
No.
I gotta get used
to being here alone sometime.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
I'll be okay too.
I'll be fine.
Oh, God.
Good morning. 
Wanna Talk once again. 
It's Mark Spencer, and here's
the latest local news for you
on this fine Monday morning. 
Our regional clam diggers
are suffering
from a rash of engine theft. 
So play it safe. 
Lock up, everybody. 
We interviewed longtime digger
Ed Wallace, 
and here's what
Ed had to say:
It's bad in the bay, 
it's bad at the docks. 
Hello, ladies.
I can't leave my boat
without chaining up my engine. 
How you doing today?
Why? Everybody needs the money, 
so they do
what they gotta do. 
But cutting out
an engine that's all locked up
with a chainsaw?
That's pretty low. 
And in local news... 
It ain't getting
any cleaner, pal.
The church is holding it's
annual fair and bake sale... 
Okay.
This from our bulletin board... 
Oh, yeah.
... will meet next Tuesday
at the community building. 
* O, my soul, mama *
* I lose control *
* Go ahead and shake
If you wanna *
Wait here a sec.
Gina?
Gina, what's going on?
It's a piece of shit.
I mean, why would
anybody wanna get inside?
You know, they just--
They just towed it here from
the dock, and he locked it up
like someone would wanna
get inside, you know?
For what, right?
You know, and-- And-- And--
And then where did
the keys go?
I mean, where did the keys go,
you know?
Okay?
Yeah.
You got a hanger?
A hanger? Yeah.
Cool. I'll open it up for you.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Oh, I helped
your sister
break into your old man's
truck today.
What?
She was kicking
the door and shit.
I took care of it.
Oh, Jesus, I forgot.
Ah, no problem.
Two seconds in and out.
Ah. I knew there was a reason
to keep you around, angel eyes.
How's it hanging, A. P. ?
Look at that.
Not much today, huh?
Oh, 500 count.
Seems a little light.
It's not.
Seems a little light.
It's not, meatball.
Un-fucking-believable.
So I don't pay rent
this month.
You know they leased everything
north of West Creek?
The beds are all
dried up west of here.
I backtracked today to see
if I had any luck closer in.
Sixty-five?
It's-- It's practically
a brand-new engine.
Yeah, well, you--
You're banging me over
the head-- If I can't--
I gotta go out there
and work and make money,
so I can pay you,
you fucking rapist.
Four o'clock?
Okay.
Four o'clock.
Can I finish now?
Oh, please.
If there are beds of clams
in that area--
It's restricted,
Julie.
South Shell restricts that area.
It's their area now.
I don't understand why you can't
just drift the boat over
this invisible line
and just dig there.
Because it's--
On the outskirts.
Because it's illegal!
How are we gonna pay
for another $200 ticket?
You're so fucking thick.
Hey.
What're you doing? Your finger's
broken? You're a cripple?
No.
Then put the pennies
in the fucking thing.
I'm doing it, Daddy.
See? Your sister's doing it.
Good girl, Donna.
See? She's not a cripple.
Hey.
So, what, are they out there
all the time or what?
I can't, Julie.
Come on.
I get one more ticket,
they take my license away.
They take my license away,
I can't work.
I don't work,
no groceries, no groceries.
The kids start dropping off
like fucking--
We're living in Africa.
All right? So please,
stop it, all right?
You're driving me
fucking nuts.
Fucking nuts.
I will wash that
mouth out with soap.
Language.
I can't do this.
What?
You can't?
You can't?
All right,
go outside and play.
Fine, I'll do it.
No, no, no, no.
Go outside and play,
all right?
Go have fun, outside.
All of you, Jesus Christ.
All of you, outside, play.
Hey, take it easy,
Frankie.
Don't tell me to take it easy.
He doesn't wanna help
his father roll pennies,
he can go outside and play!
I'll do it myself.
In front of the kids,
you tell me to break the law.
What are you talking about?
I'm just suggesting
that maybe
you drift near
the restricted area.
You drop anchor, you pull up
a couple of rakefuls.
Conservation comes by,
you just play dumb.
Right, right, right. Because
it's not illegal to be dumb.
Right? Prisons are filled
with geniuses.
Albert Einstein Penitentiary.
Move.
Oh.
Hey. What are you doing?
No.
No!
Shit.
Please turn around,
go back.
What? Why?
No, don't talk.
Oh. Why are you
doing this?
I'm coming over 'cause we've
been looking at each other.
I thought maybe--
Looking not talking.
You ruined it.
Ruined what?
Our silent flirtation.
I didn't ruin anything.
Oh, see? Now we're having
our first fight.
You're kidding, right?
Look, we had
a nice thing going on.
You know, you'd pass by,
and we would look at each other.
It was nice.
You ruined it.
God, it was so good!
Why'd you do that?!
What the hell was that?
Lemme ask you something. 
How can you work for them, man?
Like a fucking Stepford Wife.
Hey, I got
a family to feed.
I gotta have
security.
South Shell
equals security.
You're muscling us out, man.
I'm not muscling shit.
Just keeping it
above water.
You should think
about going over there.
Me? No. I don't deal
with the devil.
Who do you think
just paid for this lid?
Catch you on the flip side.
Thanks.
Yeah, yeah.
And really...
Think about it, Cons.
It was a business
selling pleasure to you.
See you at
the company picnic, prick.
Try stealing that.
You want freedom?
Okay. You, you, you.
Corner of my eye,
I thought that was your hand.
What, this?
Yeah, it looked
like you had this...
big black fuckin'...
box hand.
"Can't catch clams
with a camera. "
No wonder you
haven't had any luck.
We've all been
using rakes.
Mm.
Ah, that's what my old man
used to say
every time I'd give
him one of these.
Right before he threw it
in the garbage.
Don't take this
the wrong way, but...
your old man was a prick.
How could I take that
the wrong way?
No, he w.
It's a good thing.
He was one of those old pricks
that define this place.
Can I make
an observation?
Are you gonna
call my mom an asshole?
You're not happy.
My dad just died.
I know that,
but even before.
I've never seen you happy.
No, I take that back.
I've seen you happy,
but never content.
You ever think
about splittin'?
Oh, give me a break.
I gotta take care of Gina...
and his boat, fuckin' boat.
So sell it.
Who's gonna buy
that piece of shit?
It barely even floats.
Floating's important
for a boat.
Sell it and go.
Where am I gonna go, huh?
Nah, come on.
Leaving here right now
would be a big mistake.
You know what they say:
Mistakes are the portals
of discovery.
Fuckers.
Hello?
You need what?
Right now?
Are you serious?
Mm, little bit to the left. 
Yeah.
No. No, no, no, no. No.
Okay, hold it.
Right up here.
Oh!
Oh, that's-- Yeah.
Yeah. Right, like that.
Ah. Wait.
Right like that.
That was a good one.
Hey, I just did
what you told me to do.
Hell, it worked.
Hey, are you on the pill
or something?
You got that covered?
Not a problem.
So are you okay?
I am now.
Hey.
Hey.
What're you doin' here?
Uh...
The hot-water heater went out,
Gina gave me a call.
I swung by, lit the pilot--
She said it was
an emergency.
I wonder why
she didn't call me.
She said that she... had
trouble gettin' ahold of you.
Wh-why aren't you
still out there?
It's like fishing for donuts.
Hey.
She's, uh--
She's taking a nap.
She was pretty beat.
Gina.
Gina.
There he is.
Jack told me
you were sleeping.
Smells like Daddy.
Did you pick up his ashes?
Uh, no.
I'll do it.
I'll do it.
Look at
that angel.
And then there's this.
Ah, yes.
Uh-huh. What do you think?
There are no pictures
of me here.
Well, Mom and Dad
never cared for you much.
Whoa.
Daddy was
a dirty old man.
Oh, come on, don't judge.
Mom was gone.
People get lonely.
Yeah, this magazine is dated
two years before she died.
I remember
the day before she died,
she taught me how
to make Dad's coffee.
Black, three sugars.
"Don't forget the sugars. "
I know, he could
never make it himself.
He always screwed it up.
"Too fucking sweet. "
She always
took care of him.
Took care of everybody.
Mm-hm.
Is it terrible that I miss Mom
more than I miss Dad?
No.
It's not terrible.
Unbelievable.
How long has it been?
Microphones went out
20 minutes ago.
They're just
standing there.
How great is that?
Whoever talks first,
I'm voting for the other guy.
All right, focus, focus.
Which hole
am I aiming for?
You're a poet.
Ah. Two points.
Do you understand
the rules of this game?
Is that--?
Yeah. In the flesh.
You're a strange
fuckin' bird.
Here we go.
What? Know how much
he charges
for a shot of Wild Turkey?
It's fucking rape.
I didn't say anything.
I got seven mouths to feed.
You had another one?
Bite your fuckin' tongue.
You know you can
always borrow
my old man's boat
if you want.
I mean, before I sell it.
I've got room on my ship
if you wanna jump aboard
for a couple of days, captain.
I'd rather eat my own asshole,
but thanks.
Oh, that's fucked up.
Put that on a mantel,
you wack-job.
I can't,
we're playing doubles.
To my old man.
To your old man.
Old man.
To your old man.
So finish.
Well...
first I stopped
at Waldbaums...
'cause they were having a sale
on pork chops that day.
It's funny
what you remember.
I don't usually buy
pork chops there.
They're overpriced
at Waldbaums.
Yeah, usually,
but not that day.
And Alan loves pork chops,
so I thought I'd make
a nice dinner for him.
I walk in the door...
and the first thing I see
is Alan's pale white ass
going up and down
on top of Connie Zito.
He's humping her
on the Formica kitchen table
my grandmother gave us.
Big Connie Zito,
"from next door" Connie Zito?
Yeah, across the street.
You're so much
prettier than her. Right?
So he doesn't
even hear me.
And I'm watching 'em
for what seems like an hour,
which could not be the case
'cause Alan's never lasted
more than a minute
in his life.
So... they hump, and I watch,
and they hump.
And then finally Connie Zito
sees me, and she screams.
And Alan thinks
he's doing something right.
So she's jiggling her ass,
trying to get out
from underneath him.
But it's too late.
He can'
Oh, you've gotta
be kidding.
And as the words,
"It's not what you think, "
come spilling
out of his mouth,
he is unloading
all over the Formica.
And then Connie Zito
put her pants on backwards.
And he says,
"Honey, don't do this. "
Oh, he's putting it on you?
Well, that's very nice.
I just told him
very politely to...
clean himself
off my Formica,
put his brain
back in his pocket
and get out of my house.
And then I gave
Connie Zito the pork chops.
I told her to, uh...
take 'em home to her husband
and try not
to overcook them.
* Baby, there's a place
I know *
* That old dog
You've just gotta go *
* It's over
On the other side *
* Beyond the mountain
That's oh so high *
* So come on, go with me *
* We're makin' love... *
We'll be right back.
* Love *
* Love, love, love *
* Baby, I wanna
Go with you *
* To find your mountain
That's oh so high *
* And I've been waiting
A long, long time *
* To find out what's
On the other side... *
Mm, you going
on a picnic?
Oh, this.
No.
* We're making love *
* Love, love, love *
* Baby *
* Love, love, love *
* There'll be lots of things
That we can do *
Jesus, finally.
Darts?
Yeah.
So...
I'm sleeping
with him.
Him who?
Him... Jack.
Oh.
Yeah.
Great.
The city was just
getting too crazy.
So I decided
to run away
to my uncle's house
for a little while,
breathe some
clean air.
I gotta let it cook.
Mood lighting?
I'm in a light mood.
Oh.
Sorry I couldn't see your dad
off the other day.
Those are on me.
I gotta show you how to eat
these things the right way.
You like it
with a little kick?
I don't know yet.
This is the Mick Jagger.
Right, it's the--
The flavor,
the flash, the bite.
This is the soul,
the foundation
from which we build,
the Keith Richards.
Stones fan, are you?
Never heard of 'em.
Mm.
So here's what you do,
is you mix it up.
And then you put
a little bit of Mick
on a little bit
of Keith.
Wouldn't be the first time
that's happened.
Mm.
Mmm.
Good.
All right.
Oh, my God.
Hey!
It's an acquired taste.
So for the first time,
I realized that my needs
are important.
You know? Sexually.
It's not
a selfish thing.
Um... more power to ya.
How often does Frankie
go down on you?
Oh, Gina, I'm not comfortable
talking about that.
See? He doesn't, does he?
Don't patronize me,
seriously.
I'm not patronizing you.
Here, hold the baby.
Yeah, I think
I like clams.
Yeah?
I think I like you.
You hardly know me.
You hardly know clams.
At some point you're gonna
tell me your name, right?
Zoey.
Hm.
I'm sorry about
your father, Hunt.
Thank you, Zoey.
I can't believe--
I'm not--
What are you two girls
talkin' about?
Nothing.
What?
Sex.
You know what?
I don't wanna hear about
that shit right now.
Why don't you go
stand over there, then?
We're leaving.
Hey, Frankie?
Gina says they might be looking
for workers at South Shell.
South Shell.
I heard maybe
they were hiring.
All right,
we're going home.
I don't wanna
piss Mom off.
Oh, God forbid we should
piss off your mother.
Good night.
Hey, if you need a ride
on my ride tomorrow,
let me know.
If I need a bullet to the head,
I'll let you know too.
All right.
Good night.
Do you really
like me, Jack?
Yes.
I bet you say that
to all the girls.
Yes.
But I'm different, right?
Yes.
* Won't you let me
Walk you home from school? *
* Won't you let me
Meet you at the pool? *
You got a little, um...
* Maybe Friday I can *
* Get tickets for the dance? *
* And I'll take you *
* Ooh-ooh *
* Won't you tell your dad
"Get off my back"? *
* Tell him what we said
'Bout "Paint It Black" *
Come on. Motherfucker!
Motherfucker.
Motherfucker.
Motherfucker!
Is every engine retarded
in this fuckin' town?
Come on, man.
Solidarity.
If we get one more onboard,
we can be an organization.
We can sing it
in three-part harmony.
We get 50 onboard,
we can be a movement.
* Exceptin' Alice *
I just took
some acid.
Whoa.
Woo! Woo.
The opinion of the majority
shouldn't be equated
to the truth.
Have you met
my new little friend?
I call him...
Winston.
This is Lozo. Lozo, Winston.
Winston's a living thing.
And without even blinking
an eye, we kill thousands
and thousands upon thousands
of Winstons a day, man.
Why? Because the majority
says it's okay,
which somehow makes it truth.
But I say bullshit, brother.
Bullshit.
Just 'cause
everybody's doing it,
just 'cause it's status quo
doesn't make it truth.
I'm not trying to get all high
and mighty here. I'm just...
Right, you know, Darwinism.
Sure, okay. I--
Whoa.
Now, I'm just trying to say,
Winston here
represents to me, at least,
man's disregard for life.
What, there's not
enough food in the world?
We gotta eat
these living things?
Oh, that's fucked up, man.
Spread your legs.
Mm-hmm.
Rock back and forth.
Feel that?
Yeah.
That's right?
Yeah.
This is it?
Well, kind of.
This has nothing to do
with clamming at this point.
Yep.
That's terrible.
You know, New York,
I never been to your city.
What?
You live an hour out, and
you've never been to Manhattan?
No, I'm from the Island.
We don't go to the city.
Crazy people
out there with guns.
That is not true.
Well, I'd like to believe you,
but you're one of the crazies.
Oh-- Well, thing is,
we know we're crazy.
My mother
used to like the city.
Yeah. How is she doing?
She died
when I was 12.
Oh.
Yeah. She said she wanted
to take me when I got older,
but then she got sick.
Hey, I don't know
if you know this,
but this is
how I get women.
I talk about
my dead parents.
Yeah, I don't know about that.
I guess I just feel
like if I left here,
I would...
I don't know...
never come back.
The train goes both ways.
Yeah, well...
These are good.
Yeah?
Mm.
There's no faces in them.
You don't like to
take pictures of people?
I like taking pictures
of things.
It's easier.
They don't move.
Hm.
This one's really beautiful.
Lonely.
You should do
something with these.
Oh.
Yeah.
Nah.
Why not?
They're interesting.
Ah. You're interesting.
No, I'm not.
I'm just new to you.
Hey.
See if South Shell
is hiring, Christ.
It's a solution, Frankie.
It's a possible job
and a possible paycheck.
Well, it's not gonna
possibly fucking happen.
So let's not talk about it.
I don't wanna talk about it.
Oh, really?
Well, that's convenient.
Eat with your spoon.
Did you eat
something bad?
No.
No, I-I didn't
eat anything.
Well, maybe that's it.
Um...
No, I-I don't think
that's it.
Wha--? How do you know?
Because I know that--
That that's not it.
Frankie...
Here.
No. Ah.
Take your breakfast,
eat it outside.
But it's raining, Daddy.
What, do I speak Swahili?
Outside.
Baby.
I can go to the doctor.
You can go to the what?
Gina has a lady doctor who--
Who can take care
of it.
You wanna kill
one of my kids?
Don't you ever say
that to me.
You wanna kill
one of my kids?
No!
I don't want to, no.
Good, 'cause it's
not an option.
Oh, Frankie.
Come here.
Come here.
Baby, come here.
So I guess the, uh,
not getting pregnant
when you're breastfeeding
is a load of crap.
I'm sorry.
No, it's not your fault.
It's me, I got super seed.
It's my cross to bear.
Your cross to bear?
Hey, Cole.
Pass me that towel.
Stop it.
Some people have
a deep, abiding respect
for the natural beauty
that was once this country. 
And some people don't. 
People start pollution. 
People can stop it. 
* We need Jimmy Carter
We can't aff-- *
Oh. Oh.
Come here.
Here.
Take that, you give one
for your sister.
All right? Beat it.
Yeah?
Excuse me.
I was, uh, wondering
if you're hiring any diggers.
No. No, no,
not right now.
Well, uh, is there
an application
that maybe
I could fill out...
in case
something comes up?
Sure.
Uh...
There you go.
Uh, excuse me.
Pen?
I'm gonna need
that back.
I'm sorry.
I took your pen.
Excuse me.
You can't be back here.
Fuck!
Where the hell
is that fuck? Damn.
Fuck!
Fuck!
Fuck!
Think anyone'll
buy this boat?
Maybe I should buy it.
You wanna buy it?
I'll sell it to you.
I'll give you a really good deal
because I know you.
Not that good though,
you know.
I need to make
something.
Here.
I freak out
sometimes.
We all freak out
sometimes.
Yeah, I know,
but...
I really--
I freak out sometimes.
And you make me
not wanna freak out.
Okay.
Maybe when you go back to
New York, I'll come visit you.
You know?
See the crazies.
Oh, no.
No.
I-- I mean,
that shouldn't happen.
Why not?
Because I don't want you
to come and see me in New York.
What?
Wait. Is there
something here,
or am I making
that up?
No, you're not
making anything up.
I mean, I'm having
a great time. I just...
I have a lot
of my own stuff.
You know? And...
I mean, I thought I--
I thought I made this clear
from the beginning.
Look, we're just
having fun.
Right?
Fun, yeah.
Look, this is
my fault.
I shouldn't have given you
the wrong impression.
Damn. I broke my own rule.
Uh, what--? What rule is that?
Don't screw a local?
That's mean.
Hunt, are you with me?
Yeah.
No. Obviously.
I'm gonna take
you home.
Here's your bulb.
Thank you.
I didn't just
screw you.
I can walk home.
Hey.
Hey.
Is there something
you'd like to ask?
No?
Then quit with
the mental-patient stare.
What the hell
is wrong with you?
What the hell
is wrong with you?
Why are you
hanging out with Jack?
I'm not.
You know, he, um...
He helped me
with Daddy's truck
that one day, but...
Okay.
Are you gonna get mad?
Yeah.
But are you gonna get mad?
Yeah.
Then I'm not gonna answer you.
You just did.
Bullshit I did.
Do you have
any id--?
I'm gonna
kill him.
Stop it. Hey, hey.
Stop it.
Who do you think you are?
This is Jack
we're talking about!
Don't you think
I know who he is?
I know what that scumbag
is all about.
Don't call him a scumbag.
I thought you were his friend.
He is my friend, that's how
I know he's a scumbag.
Some friend. You know what?
I probably know him a lot
better than you do.
I know exactly
what he is all about.
I have responsibilities--
Not for me you don't.
You're not responsible for me.
Hey. Hey.
I'm 36 years old.
And I've been
through a lot of shit.
Both of my parents
are dead,
and my ex-husband
should be.
You know, so this
is my time, you know?
I just wanna
enjoy myself, have fun.
That's all.
Why does everyone wanna have fun
all the time?
Hey, Dad would flip
if he knew that you and Jack--
Yeah, well,
Dad's not here anymore.
And you're not Dad.
And you wanna
know something else?
No, what? Enlighten me.
You are gonna hate me
saying this.
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Jack doesn't disappoint.
Fuck.
Yeah. Don't do anything stupid.
I mean it. I mean it!
* I'm feeling good *
* About America *
* And I feel it
Everywhere I go *
* I'm feeling good *
* About America *
Albert Einstein said--
And I'm paraphrasing here.
- -"I don't believe God
would have created a universe
any less than perfect. "
He's of the theory
the universe is marble-like:
smooth, round,
no imperfections, beautiful,
just perfect.
Why would God create anything
less than perfect?
Right?
That's one
school of thought.
The other school
believes the universe
.
It does have
imperfections:
ridges and knots
and holes.
And those,
in laymen terms,
are the two schools
of quantum physics.
You're either
of the belief that the universe
and everything that exists is
made up of marble,
or it's made up of wood.
Marble or wood.
Marble or wood.
No?
All right,
check it out.
Hm?
Let's try
to lighten the mood.
What could be more welcoming
after Vietnam, Watergate
and all we've been through?
Oh, shit.
What?
Those are
the South Shell assholes.
The South Shell
assholes?
Yep.
That guy
is big.
Yep.
There is a change that's... 
Hey.
Hey, pal.
You look familiar.
Hey, lemme ask
you something.
Would you say you're made up
of marble or wood?
Hell are you
talking about?
We're not talking to you,
little man.
Little man, big mind. It's a
simple question. Marble or wood?
Can you believe
this shit?
Didn't your mother teach you
to pick up your trash?
You don't know
my mom.
Let me buy
you fellas a shot.
Nick,
four Turkeys.
You didn't answer my question.
Are you made up
of wood or marble?
Tell you what your friend
better be made of.
He better be
made of money.
He's got some damages
to pay for.
Four more.
Big spender.
This is a good idea.
Let's drink and relax.
Wood, marble, pfft.
What--? What does it matter?
You know what
I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go roll
a big joint, eh?
We can all smoke
from the peace pipe.
Ah, I'll be
right back.
Nobody do
anything bad.
Three more.
Don't do
anything bad.
Be cool.
Be cool.
Be cool, man.
Be cool, man.
Be cool.
Be cool.
Oh, and look at this. 
It keeps coming.
Hey, uh... did it say
"generous motherfucker"
on his application?
I don't know.
I didn't read it.
He's gonna pay
for those damages though.
Yeah, yeah.
He's gonna pay.
You want me to pay?
Is that what you want?
'Cause-- 'Cause I have
my money outside,
if you'd like to come
outside with me.
You wanna go outside?
That's what I'd like.
You wanna go outside with us?
That's what I'd like.
To get the money
that you haven't got.
That's exactly
what I'd like.
And then
I swallowed it.
Serious, wouldn't you?
You're a son of a bitch.
What?
Are you fucking
my sister?
Whoa, take it easy.
Take--
Are you fucking her?
Take it easy.
Are you?
It's not like that.
Just answer the question.
What--?
No.
I am not.
No, I'm not
fucking your sister.
You're a fucking liar,
'cause she told me. Son of a--
Aw, fuck.
Oh!
Hausenfeffer!
Hausenfeffer!
Fucking
hausenfeffer, man!
You get
the fuck off me!
You jackass!
Motherfucker!
Hey, hey.
Ow! Fucker.
Jesus Christ.
Whoa.
Cut the shit.
Oh, shit.
Jesus, they give me
a minute to make a call.
They give Cons an hour.
Is Julie pissed off?
She'll get
over it.
She's a catch, huh?
No shit, man.
She's my heart.
You like being a father?
Well...
kids drive me bananas, but...
I thank God every day
for those little fuckers.
They saved my life,
you know?
Hey. I broke a tooth.
Hey. You're lucky
you're over there, asshole.
Yeah, right. I'm the asshole.
Shut the fuck up.
What are you really
so pissed off about anyway, huh?
Why am I--? Our dad dies.
Gina's still recovering
from the shrapnel of Shithead,
you think it's the perfect time
to fuck my sister.
Fuck you, Hunt!
First of all, you have no idea
what's going on between us.
Secondly... fuck you.
And thirdly, what business is it
of yours anyway, huh?
I mean, who are you?
I'm her brother, you idiot.
Yeah, you're a 34-year-old man.
You're an adult.
Try worrying about yourself.
Stay away from her.
I was just trying
to help Gina out.
I'm telling you the truth.
I-- I wasn't looking for it.
And...
Then it just happened.
What, "it just happened"?
Y-you stuck your dick
in every hole in this town?
Oh!
You made a choice.
You make choices
and you live with that.
Okay.
All right, I got it.
Just like you chose
not to be there
when your sister
needed you most.
Because you had to go
take a picture of a pole.
Like you chose to sleep in
and not be in the bay
the day your father died.
Or like you choose
to be here,
with all of us
in this place,
and yet you're not
really here at all.
You know what I mean?
So yes, I'm fucking your sister.
Okay, here's the deal.
It's in two parts, let me
get it all out. One:
Those three assholes
are getting sewn up
over at Good Samaritan's.
Fine. Their problem,
not ours.
Because what we've got
is a witness statement
saying they jumped you,
Lozo,
and you were acting
in self-defense.
Also, I was in the bathroom
the whole time.
Witness?
Nick, bartender,
client of mine.
Yeah, but where were we?
You?You were--
I don't know. Playing fucking
tiddlywinks with Gina.
Hey.
Let's say you were taking
snapshots of your nuts.
Why is this hard
to let me finish?
Okay, two.
This part kills me.
My supplier,
who will go unnamed,
will now receive 80 percent
of my profits. Fine.
So one of you
or all of you
is gonna give me a place to stay
during this down-and-out phase.
This doesn't happen,
we all get to know each other
better in jail. Understood?
So I was thinking
we should have a talk.
Probably should've
done it before, but...
you know, we didn't.
Feel free to jump in
whenever you'd like, Dad.
It's okay. I don't mind.
I've been thinking
that, um...
Well, maybe if I was
out there...
when you wanted me
to be out there,
I could've done something.
Or, uh, saved you, or...
you know,
helped in some way.
And, uh, I know that...
You know, I'm not
what you really probably...
wanted me to be.
Uh...
I wish I was.
Uh...
I mean I really
wish I was.
And, uh...
I'm sorry that I was...
late.
You guys sure
about this?
Sure, man.
Absolutely.

Julie.
What?
Julie!
I said, what?
Stop the kids
from flushing the toy shit
down the toilet.
You want the kids to stop,
tell them yourself,
Frankie,
because they're thick
like you.
You can't be afraid to yell.
I'm not afraid.
Obviously you're not afraid.
You're yelling at me
in front of people.
I'm not yelling at you.
This is not yelling.
You're not yelling right now?
No.
Is she not yell--? Don't answer.
Are you yelling?
No, I am not
yelling at you.
Before you jump to it,
answer the--
Listen to what I'm saying.
I'm giving you an option.
Yes or no? Yes or no?
No.
This is what I deal with
every day.
That's really nice, Frankie.
Hey, hey, hey.
You look good.
Which way are you headed?
West.
If I'll go the other way,
I'll hit water.
So Jack's
not moving in?
God, no.
Jack'snotmoving in.
Hey, we're out
of toilet paper.
Uh, no smoking in the house,
you shit.
Your old man smoked here.
Look where that got him.
Finish it outside, or I'll
put it out on your tongue.
You are definitely
made of wood.
Hey, Cons.
Take care
of my sister.
That's why I'm here.
