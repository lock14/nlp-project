This is no toy.



Wait, l have found something 
on a Russian frequency.



Roadblocks



Every five kilometer from here to Vilnius.



So, we're stuck for now.



Did you get something?
- It's freezing out there.



Open it.



Do you think these are pepper corns?



These are frozen maggots.



This was rotten before it froze.



I put this in your head.
- Stop it



The boy is Hannibal Lecter…



and the little girl is Mischa.



We eat

Eight years later.



Let's hear you little master



He is mute.
- He's not mute at night.



He can screem well enough and he'll sing.



This is not your fathers house anymore.
It's the people's orphanage…



and you're just one more orphan.



Gunter



I see you in my office.



Hannibal



You do not honour the human pecking order.
You're always hurting the bullies.



I know.
This was your mothers room.



It must be difficult for you
to live in this house.



Go to bed.



Go To Bed



Mischa



Get up.



Now screem all you please



Everyday you'll pay for this.



Everyday for the rest 
of your short and nasty live

You look like your uncle Hannibal.



Would you like to try?



Use this



Speak to me.



Thank you.



Hannibal.



Here is where l pray to my ancestors,



for strenght and courage



I have the honor.
Only on my ancestors birthday…



to polish his armour with oil of clove



This is after the fight
for Osaka castle.



The Samurai displayed the head of their enemies



There are more suitable parchments,
that will interest you



Be gentle Hannibal and be brave…



Like your father



And like him.



You must be ready for anything.



Come.



Again.



Again.



Well. Again.



Hé, Japonese.



Hé, Japonese.



Messieur please



Is that it?
- Yes.



Hé, Japonese tell me the truth.…



Does your pussy run crossways?



Full of  straight hairs that will explode.



Hannibal



Don't move



If you pissed in my fueltank, 
l'll twist your head of.



Paul Momund, the butcher.



You owe a certain lady
 an apology.



Apologise to la Japonese?



Boy must be crazy to come here. 
I throw you in the river…



or maybe l slit your pants
and give you something you don't want,



where you don't want it.



You inquired about her... pussy.



You speculated it went, which way?



Jap pussy runs crossways.



You should fuck the Jap
and see for yourself.



Crossways like that?



Or more tangential?



You see how you now stains the air?



I should add that to my drawing.



Would you like to see it?



Wait for me.



This here was done by a single blade.



Ah inspector Popil, 
l am very happy you could come.



You won't remember me but l was with the cause



- You delivered the rait to Nuerenburg
l sat behind you



I saw you bring the evidence



It's an honor sir.



What do we have here?
- Paul Momund, or   most of it.



You have his dossier.
- Yes.



Fat and ugly.
He shipped Jews for Marseille.



He fought recently.



And often.



Last saturdaynight a barfight.
He had many enemies.



A list please, his recent opponents



You have done nothing to this body?
- No, no, no sir.



The chief specifficaly…
- The odour, it's eh …



It's not of anything you use here?



It smells like a toothpain remedy



Yes, oil of cloves.



Let's see the pharmasist



Look.



The most exquiset bits
of the fish are the cheeks



This is true for many creatures



When carving at the table,
you one give cheek to madame…



the other to the guest of honour.
- Did you hear?



They haven't found that butcher's
damned ugly head yet.



Good evening, milady.



I hope you don't mind.



I would have used a butcher's-knife,
but the sword seems appropriate.



Not a knick in the blade, l promise you



The butcher was like butter.



You didn't need to do this for me



Rudeness is epidemic, milady



Police.



They will call it a murder.



It was the crime of passion.



Wash your hands, quickly.  Go.



Inspector Popjil?
- Popil, Madame.



Popil.



Hannibal Lecter?



Good evening.



You fought with the butcher,
Paul Momund, in the market.



Now he is dead.



I must ask you to come along with me.



Is your name Hannibal Lecter?



Yes.



Do you have any guilty knowledge
of the death of Paul Momund?



Guilty knowledge?
- Limit your responses to yes or no.



No.



It's funny la. 
He reacts to nothing.



Monstrous.



The butcher had been fishing.



Blood and scales on his knife, 
but no fish.



The tape tells you all that?



Remarkable.



No.



The chef told me, 
you brought a splendid fish in for dinner.



Where did you get that fish?
- By fishing, inspector.



We keep a baited line in the water
behind the boathouse



I show you if you like.



My speciality
is warcrimes.



And I know 
they do not end with the war



You lost your entire family.
So did I.



For you your beautiful aunt came and… 
made up for it all.



The very scent of her must have
taken away the smell of the camp



So
when Paul the butcher spewed filth at her



I can understand if you killed him.



Tell me what happened, Hannibal.



Together we could show a court.



The very scent of her
takes away the smell of the camp



Do you compose verse inspector,
and keep it under your pillow?



Now tell me inspector,
did you choose warcrimes



because your lost family in the war?
- Yes.



How?



Some in combat, some were shipped east



Did you catch who did it?



No.



But they were Vichy, men like the butcher?



Yes.



Then we are both suspects.



I can say you were fishing with me
if you like.



Inspector, you must see this.



I told you to keep these people away.



Is that the butcher?
- Yes, Mr.



How long?
- Ten minutes, no longer.



Father… mother…



I am the youngest student
they've ever admitted into medical school.



It's a work scolarship.
I think you would be pleased.



Heavy duties on my uncles estate



have finally forced the sell of the chateau.



Lady Murasaki will leave for Paris with me.



The residency in France is 
now a doghouse.



Medical institute Saint Marie - Paris.



This work-scolarship 



Means  l must spend much of my sparetime
preparing bodies for the anatomyclass



My studies are fascinating 
and absorb me completely.



Yet I still find myself
thinking about my sister



and to the men who her from me.



Hannibal.



Do you suppose god intended to eat Isaac?



That's why he told Abraham to kill him.



Eat him? Of course not.



The angel intervenes in time.



Not always.



I have to know about Mischa.



I see their faces in my dreams…



but l can't remember what they called 
each other with their blooded mouths.



I would give anything to remember



Hannibal,



memory is a knife,
it hurts you.



I want to stay here with you.



No, you must stay at school.



Louis I need you to remember



Who told the nazis
where the children were hidden?



You must remember.



I can't bear to think about it



This will help you remember.



Hannibal Lecter.
What are you doing here?



The body,
I am a medical student now.



Yes I know,
I have followed your progress.



You repeat nothing you hear in this room.



Please, Louis.



Klaus Barbie shipped
the children to Auswitch.



Who told him where the children where hidden?
Did you tell him?



When they broke my fingers,
I gave them Pardou.



Pardou knew where
children were hidden.



He's mayor of Belleville now.



Thank you, Louis.
- Inspector.



Yes.
- Where were the police?



No no no, no no no please please.



You knew at-once what Louis wanted,
didn't you.



His crucifix to remain with his brain,
not his heart.



He answered your question,
but you didn't answer his.



Where were the police when the nazis
threw the children into the trucks?



Come and play



One little cheek, two little cheeks.



Cough.



She has pneumonia.



Let's take her



She's going to die anyway



Come on



Get out.
