1
00:00:27,156 --> 00:00:29,522
You can expect highs
in the mid-70s today

2
00:00:29,559 --> 00:00:31,959
and unless you're driving
a jet pack to work

3
00:00:31,994 --> 00:00:34,462
get used to the slow-and-go
traffic for your morning commute.

4
00:00:34,497 --> 00:00:36,226
Now onto more troubling news

5
00:00:36,265 --> 00:00:38,256
emerging from the Coolidge County
school district.

6
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:40,531
Millions of dollars are missing
from the school coffers

7
00:00:40,570 --> 00:00:42,697
due to the district's sloppy
accounting procedures

8
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:45,007
and no one can seem to
pinpoint the missing loot.

9
00:00:45,074 --> 00:00:47,736
District Chairwoman Olympia Parpadelle
had no comment,

10
00:00:47,777 --> 00:00:50,541
but county insiders blame
staff shortages, incompetence

11
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:52,571
and a troubling climate
of corruption

12
00:00:52,615 --> 00:00:55,277
at a time when the county's children
continue to score

13
00:00:55,318 --> 00:00:57,843
at the bottom of statewide tests.

14
00:00:57,887 --> 00:00:59,616
Moving on to sports,

15
00:00:59,655 --> 00:01:01,646
it seems the chimpanzee
that interrupted

16
00:01:01,691 --> 00:01:03,955
Saturday's community college
baseball playoffs...

17
00:01:06,596 --> 00:01:08,826
Hey, you okay?

18
00:01:08,865 --> 00:01:10,833
Yeah.

19
00:01:10,867 --> 00:01:13,563
Same shit, different day, huh?

20
00:01:15,705 --> 00:01:18,538
Something like that, yeah.

21
00:01:18,574 --> 00:01:20,565
Yeah.

22
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,441
# I wanted to #

23
00:01:24,147 --> 00:01:25,774
# To find another spot #

24
00:01:25,815 --> 00:01:28,784
# To pay you #

25
00:01:28,818 --> 00:01:30,547
# It's just that I forgot #

26
00:01:30,586 --> 00:01:32,952
# But nobody has the time #

27
00:01:32,989 --> 00:01:35,480
# To sit and blow my mind #

28
00:01:35,525 --> 00:01:37,891
# But I'm so ready #

29
00:01:37,927 --> 00:01:39,758
# To leave this shit behind #

30
00:01:39,796 --> 00:01:41,787
# And you've been
around the block #

31
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:44,391
# More times than him #

32
00:01:44,434 --> 00:01:46,834
# And everybody catches you #

33
00:01:46,869 --> 00:01:48,894
# When you've got nothing #

34
00:01:48,938 --> 00:01:52,135
# But you're only 24 #

35
00:01:52,175 --> 00:01:54,541
# But you still want more #

36
00:01:54,577 --> 00:01:56,670
# And you gotta start over #

37
00:01:56,712 --> 00:01:59,180
-# Every time you close the door #
-Here you go.

38
00:01:59,215 --> 00:02:01,445
# But don't worry, baby #

39
00:02:01,484 --> 00:02:03,952
# There's another night waiting #

40
00:02:03,986 --> 00:02:06,454
# And maybe by the morning #

41
00:02:06,489 --> 00:02:10,653
# There'll be something
worth saving #

42
00:02:10,693 --> 00:02:15,721
# Then I'll say you made it #

43
00:02:15,765 --> 00:02:20,099
# Then I'll say
you made it #

44
00:02:20,136 --> 00:02:22,331
# Yeah. #

45
00:02:32,148 --> 00:02:34,514
# I wanted to find #

46
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,018
# Another way to look at you #

47
00:02:37,053 --> 00:02:39,317
# But everybody's saying #

48
00:02:39,355 --> 00:02:41,619
# That I've got way too much
to lose #

49
00:02:41,657 --> 00:02:45,684
# So I hold you till the morning
meets the afternoon #

50
00:02:45,728 --> 00:02:48,219
# And you don't mind
that I leave #

51
00:02:48,264 --> 00:02:50,425
# You've got your things
to do #

52
00:02:59,976 --> 00:03:02,410
# But don't worry, baby #

53
00:03:02,445 --> 00:03:05,312
# There's another night waiting #

54
00:03:05,348 --> 00:03:07,646
# And maybe by the morning #

55
00:03:07,683 --> 00:03:11,744
# There'll be something
worth saving #

56
00:03:11,787 --> 00:03:15,780
# Then I'll say you made it #

57
00:03:15,825 --> 00:03:18,589
# Yeah #

58
00:03:37,947 --> 00:03:40,643
# But don't worry, baby #

59
00:03:40,683 --> 00:03:42,947
# There's another night waiting #

60
00:03:42,985 --> 00:03:45,749
# And maybe by the morning #

61
00:03:45,788 --> 00:03:49,815
# There'll be something worth saving #

62
00:03:49,859 --> 00:03:55,354
# Then I'll say you made it... #

63
00:04:31,467 --> 00:04:33,765
I failed you, Pop.

64
00:04:36,806 --> 00:04:40,333
Catherine, the bond market
is for pussies.

65
00:04:40,376 --> 00:04:43,834
Oh, God, what do the homosexuals
want now?

66
00:04:43,879 --> 00:04:46,973
Mr. Conroy to see you.

67
00:04:47,016 --> 00:04:48,779
Send him in.

68
00:04:52,355 --> 00:04:54,653
Jasper Macaveady
and Adelle Horowitz.

69
00:04:54,690 --> 00:04:57,284
Jasper Macaveady and
Adelle Horowitz.

70
00:04:57,326 --> 00:04:59,760
Oh, for fuck's sake.

71
00:05:08,204 --> 00:05:10,035
Okay.

72
00:05:23,552 --> 00:05:25,349
Scotch man, right?

73
00:05:25,388 --> 00:05:27,117
No, actually, I don't touch the stuff.

74
00:05:34,697 --> 00:05:36,756
Pinot then?

75
00:05:36,799 --> 00:05:38,664
Sure.

76
00:05:42,004 --> 00:05:44,837
Jasper poured gravy
all in my hair.

77
00:05:47,176 --> 00:05:49,269
I can see that.

78
00:05:50,946 --> 00:05:54,882
Jasper, where did you get gravy
at 8:00 AM?

79
00:05:57,787 --> 00:06:00,881
Jasper buddy, you know the drill.

80
00:06:00,923 --> 00:06:03,289
Go walk the railroad tracks
until lunch.

81
00:06:04,326 --> 00:06:07,056
Hey, I don't make the rules.

82
00:06:08,664 --> 00:06:11,758
Adelle, I don't know, honey.

83
00:06:11,801 --> 00:06:15,066
It will eventually dry, so...

84
00:06:19,408 --> 00:06:23,037
I'll call your mom.
She'll bring you some new clothes, okay?

85
00:06:23,079 --> 00:06:24,603
Oh, shit.

86
00:06:25,648 --> 00:06:28,048
No no no. I can't hug you.

87
00:06:28,084 --> 00:06:30,075
I can't hug you.
It's against policy.

88
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:33,555
Plus I'll get gravy
all over my shirt.

89
00:06:34,957 --> 00:06:37,152
So, okay?

90
00:06:37,193 --> 00:06:38,558
What do you want?

91
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,066
Do you want some grapefruit?
I got grapefruit.

92
00:07:00,116 --> 00:07:02,016
Look, Conroy, you know

93
00:07:02,051 --> 00:07:05,452
I can't discuss my dealings
with other parents,

94
00:07:05,488 --> 00:07:08,184
but if you want those kind of grades
for little Julie,

95
00:07:08,224 --> 00:07:09,953
it's gonna cost you
more than 10 Gs.

96
00:07:09,992 --> 00:07:14,554
Gigi Fenstermacher told me
she only paid $7500.

97
00:07:14,597 --> 00:07:16,656
Gigi Fenstermacher is a whore.

98
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,324
And do you think I served her

99
00:07:19,368 --> 00:07:23,168
the 1986 Bouchemal Pinot
you're drinking?

100
00:07:23,205 --> 00:07:25,196
Let me answer that for you.

101
00:07:25,241 --> 00:07:27,869
No, I did not.

102
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:31,175
I'm willing to pay $12,000.

103
00:07:31,213 --> 00:07:33,647
Now that's a substantial bribe,
Harper.

104
00:07:33,682 --> 00:07:36,515
I want you to guarantee
straight A's.

105
00:07:36,552 --> 00:07:39,316
Well,

106
00:07:39,355 --> 00:07:41,619
then I guess when little Julie
flunks out

107
00:07:41,657 --> 00:07:44,490
and she's selling her hot little body
for a hit of crystal meth,

108
00:07:44,527 --> 00:07:47,155
I'll have to be the one to tell her
that her cheapskate dad

109
00:07:47,196 --> 00:07:49,562
killed himself out of shame.

110
00:07:49,598 --> 00:07:52,328
That's all I'm prepared to pay,

111
00:07:52,368 --> 00:07:55,098
-nothing more.
-You can afford more.

112
00:07:55,137 --> 00:07:56,900
-Bartlett!
-Yes, sir.

113
00:07:56,939 --> 00:07:59,169
Playback.

114
00:08:02,044 --> 00:08:05,536
I'm willing to pay $12,000.

115
00:08:05,581 --> 00:08:07,947
Now that's a substantial
bribe, Harper.

116
00:08:07,983 --> 00:08:10,144
I want you to guarantee
straight A's.

117
00:08:12,087 --> 00:08:15,454
Hmm, bribing an elementary-school
principal.

118
00:08:15,491 --> 00:08:18,324
That's a serious crime, Conroy.

119
00:08:20,095 --> 00:08:22,495
$15,000.

120
00:08:22,531 --> 00:08:24,158
Do it.

121
00:08:35,110 --> 00:08:37,840
Me.

122
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,713
Me me me me me!

123
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,688
Go to the bank, deposit that
in my account.

124
00:08:50,726 --> 00:08:53,320
And wear the red wig this time.

125
00:08:53,362 --> 00:08:55,193
It makes your can look smaller.

126
00:08:55,231 --> 00:08:57,529
Okay.

127
00:08:57,566 --> 00:08:59,830
Harper, Rebecca Seberg

128
00:08:59,869 --> 00:09:02,099
from the school board
is on her way here.

129
00:09:02,137 --> 00:09:05,004
Something about
an emergency inspection.

130
00:09:06,475 --> 00:09:08,466
Is everything all right?

131
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:12,207
Peaches and pearls, Melody.
Peaches and pearls.

132
00:09:15,651 --> 00:09:19,212
Yank my caddy from class, tell him
to meet me on the hopscotch squares.

133
00:09:23,425 --> 00:09:25,222
What?

134
00:09:25,261 --> 00:09:27,729
That ain't mine.

135
00:09:27,763 --> 00:09:29,993
Okay.

136
00:09:30,032 --> 00:09:31,624
Say it.

137
00:09:31,667 --> 00:09:34,067
It ain't yours.

138
00:09:35,471 --> 00:09:36,961
Good girl.

139
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:44,070
This is your principal speaking.
Please be aware

140
00:09:44,113 --> 00:09:47,310
that an inspector from the district
will be on campus today.

141
00:09:47,349 --> 00:09:49,840
Carry on as usual.
No need to put on a show.

142
00:09:49,885 --> 00:09:52,445
Also, try not to eat the lead-based paint

143
00:09:52,488 --> 00:09:54,388
that's flaking off the walls
in the south wing.

144
00:09:54,423 --> 00:09:56,448
That is called poison.

145
00:09:56,492 --> 00:09:59,825
Due to budget cuts, PE clothes
will now be laundered every third Friday.

146
00:09:59,862 --> 00:10:01,796
And lastly, big thanks
to Bobby Templeton,

147
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:04,196
shop class is canceled
till we find the finger.

148
00:10:04,233 --> 00:10:06,360
That is all.

149
00:10:06,402 --> 00:10:09,303
What?

150
00:10:09,338 --> 00:10:12,364
Are we gonna
learn anything today

151
00:10:12,408 --> 00:10:14,069
or are we just
gonna sit here again

152
00:10:14,109 --> 00:10:16,168
and watch you mope
about your divorce?

153
00:10:30,225 --> 00:10:32,523
You know what, Frankie?

154
00:10:32,561 --> 00:10:34,722
Why don't you go
fuck yourself?

155
00:10:38,334 --> 00:10:40,302
Yeah, Sarah.

156
00:10:40,336 --> 00:10:42,736
Why is Mr. Buchwald
sleeping in the gym?

157
00:10:42,771 --> 00:10:45,171
You like questions, Sarah?

158
00:10:45,207 --> 00:10:47,198
Yeah? Try this one.

159
00:10:47,242 --> 00:10:49,642
How do you think you're gonna
make it to third grade

160
00:10:49,678 --> 00:10:52,442
when you fill out your times tables
like a drunk retard?

161
00:10:55,551 --> 00:10:57,644
Mm,

162
00:10:57,686 --> 00:10:59,916
you know,

163
00:10:59,955 --> 00:11:02,549
when my uncle was my age

164
00:11:02,591 --> 00:11:04,582
he walked in on Aunt Sis

165
00:11:04,626 --> 00:11:06,685
screwing the tub-and-tile repairman.

166
00:11:06,729 --> 00:11:08,822
You know what he did?

167
00:11:08,864 --> 00:11:11,958
He hitchhiked all the way
from Sioux City, Iowa,

168
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:14,196
to Annapolis, Maryland,
in one day.

169
00:11:14,236 --> 00:11:17,103
He dove into the Chesapeake

170
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:19,539
and he just swam straight out.

171
00:11:19,575 --> 00:11:23,875
He just swam
and he swam and he swam.

172
00:11:25,781 --> 00:11:30,241
Next day the Coast Guard
found his body bobbing in the Atlantic.

173
00:11:32,588 --> 00:11:34,579
You think you kids
got some problems?

174
00:11:34,623 --> 00:11:36,921
Your favorite Saturday-morning
cartoon

175
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,927
is preempted by figure skating?

176
00:11:38,961 --> 00:11:42,021
You try to fart and you get
a little poop in your pants?

177
00:11:42,064 --> 00:11:44,089
Give me a break.

178
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:47,034
Try marriage.

179
00:11:48,437 --> 00:11:50,735
Yeah, Sarah, what?

180
00:11:50,773 --> 00:11:52,468
Can I go to the bathroom?

181
00:11:52,508 --> 00:11:55,102
Sweetie, you can go home
for all I care.

182
00:11:55,144 --> 00:11:58,113
Okay.

183
00:12:02,084 --> 00:12:04,075
Bye.

184
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:06,110
Whatever.

185
00:12:19,601 --> 00:12:21,728
Don't get lazy, Walter.

186
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,965
I'd go with the nine iron if I were you.

187
00:12:24,006 --> 00:12:28,375
Shut up, Walter.
You're not a real caddy.

188
00:12:43,025 --> 00:12:44,686
Is everything in place, Maurice?

189
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:48,253
Like a jigsaw puzzle, my brother.

190
00:12:48,297 --> 00:12:52,791
And you're absolutely sure
they'll shut us down?

191
00:12:52,835 --> 00:12:56,703
Yeah, you got my vote
of no-confidentio

192
00:12:56,738 --> 00:12:59,832
and the inspector's report
which will be nothing short of God-awful.

193
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:02,605
I'd say the coffin is all but shut

194
00:13:02,644 --> 00:13:05,613
on your pathetic excuse
for a school.

195
00:13:05,647 --> 00:13:08,411
Yes, sir, our master plan
is gonna make

196
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:10,509
your parental kickbacks
look like peanuts.

197
00:13:10,552 --> 00:13:12,486
What about
Chairwoman Parpadelle?

198
00:13:12,521 --> 00:13:15,490
Why don't we burn that bridge
when we get to it?

199
00:13:15,524 --> 00:13:17,856
Don't sweat it.
She's rolling by later

200
00:13:17,893 --> 00:13:20,487
and she's the easiest bribe
in the district, brohan.

201
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:21,723
Good work, Maurice.

202
00:13:21,763 --> 00:13:23,355
Thanks, man.

203
00:13:23,398 --> 00:13:25,298
Gotta tell you,

204
00:13:25,334 --> 00:13:27,734
in no time we're gonna be
hanging out

205
00:13:27,769 --> 00:13:30,329
in fucking Surinam

206
00:13:30,372 --> 00:13:32,806
snorting blow
off a walrus's cock.

207
00:13:32,841 --> 00:13:36,436
Hey,

208
00:13:36,478 --> 00:13:40,107
you want to get beer later
or something?

209
00:13:40,149 --> 00:13:43,550
We could get, like,
a cocktail.

210
00:13:43,585 --> 00:13:45,849
What do you think, Maurice?

211
00:13:45,888 --> 00:13:47,879
No.

212
00:13:53,962 --> 00:13:55,987
Later.

213
00:14:05,874 --> 00:14:08,308
You're my only friend.

214
00:14:12,414 --> 00:14:13,881
Harper.

215
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:17,647
Uh, excuse me, Harper.

216
00:14:17,686 --> 00:14:21,417
Hey, you... you have time
for a chat?

217
00:14:21,456 --> 00:14:24,983
It has to do
with an inspection later.

218
00:14:26,061 --> 00:14:28,529
Come with me.

219
00:14:42,878 --> 00:14:44,709
What do you know?

220
00:14:44,746 --> 00:14:46,577
Nothing.

221
00:14:46,615 --> 00:14:48,742
Same with the faculty.
We're all in the dark.

222
00:14:48,784 --> 00:14:50,979
Here's your brunch, sir.

223
00:14:52,254 --> 00:14:53,846
A hard-boiled egg?

224
00:14:53,889 --> 00:14:57,518
No, I'm good.

225
00:15:03,398 --> 00:15:05,628
It's for the greater good
that no one knows,

226
00:15:05,667 --> 00:15:07,658
including you, Tommy.

227
00:15:07,703 --> 00:15:11,469
Yeah, but I'm the vice principal.

228
00:15:11,506 --> 00:15:15,465
I mean, this is something
I should be let in on.

229
00:15:16,612 --> 00:15:18,603
It's a public elementary school, Tom,

230
00:15:18,647 --> 00:15:21,047
not some third-rate Montessori.

231
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,985
Things get hairy
when there are too many chiefs

232
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:28,114
and not enough
itty-bitty little Indians.

233
00:15:28,156 --> 00:15:31,216
Okay, vice principal?

234
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:35,819
I like you, Tom.

235
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:41,797
I know your past, Tom.

236
00:15:43,338 --> 00:15:45,363
Don't be a hero.

237
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:03,258
Back to class, Sarah.

238
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:26,612
Oh, hey.

239
00:16:26,648 --> 00:16:28,616
Yeah, look at you.

240
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:30,709
Rebecca Seberg.

241
00:16:30,752 --> 00:16:32,344
Yeah, the inspector.

242
00:16:32,387 --> 00:16:35,686
Well, look, do it.
Inspect away.

243
00:16:35,724 --> 00:16:38,215
I'll tell you what you'll find, though...

244
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:42,390
a school on the brink,
a school beyond all hope,

245
00:16:42,431 --> 00:16:45,025
Old Yeller,

246
00:16:45,067 --> 00:16:48,093
but not a dog.

247
00:16:48,136 --> 00:16:49,626
Wow.

248
00:16:49,671 --> 00:16:53,835
It's rare to find
that kind of optimism these days.

249
00:16:55,911 --> 00:16:57,845
Sarcasm.

250
00:16:57,879 --> 00:17:00,347
You know what that is?

251
00:17:00,382 --> 00:17:02,748
Lobstergram,

252
00:17:02,784 --> 00:17:06,584
yeah, from Uncle Plimpton
back in Nantucket.

253
00:17:06,621 --> 00:17:09,715
Lobsters are

254
00:17:09,758 --> 00:17:11,953
arthropods,

255
00:17:11,993 --> 00:17:14,757
crustaceans,
cockroaches of the sea,

256
00:17:14,796 --> 00:17:17,458
but for all that
they are spineless,

257
00:17:17,499 --> 00:17:21,230
literally exoskeleton.

258
00:17:21,269 --> 00:17:24,136
I'm not sure
I follow the analogy.

259
00:17:24,172 --> 00:17:27,505
And I'm not saying
there was one.

260
00:17:31,847 --> 00:17:34,281
Maybe now there is.

261
00:17:44,826 --> 00:17:46,817
Listen, toots,

262
00:17:46,862 --> 00:17:49,660
you spend all day in your
fancy-Nancy administration building,

263
00:17:49,698 --> 00:17:52,292
but this isn't basic training, okay?
This is live fire.

264
00:17:52,334 --> 00:17:54,393
And I should know.
I was in 'Nam...

265
00:17:55,604 --> 00:17:58,300
three years ago
on vacation, fine.

266
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,798
But the point is, I knew
when that war was lost,

267
00:18:01,843 --> 00:18:05,040
just like I know these kids
are pretty much retarded.

268
00:18:05,080 --> 00:18:08,413
And a retard's kind of like
a dying dog.

269
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,385
All they're good for is a laugh

270
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:14,548
and a kickin'.

271
00:18:15,957 --> 00:18:19,393
And a kickin'. Got that?

272
00:18:19,428 --> 00:18:22,329
I'm gonna look around
if you don't mind.

273
00:18:22,364 --> 00:18:24,423
Boom. Do it.

274
00:18:29,171 --> 00:18:32,299
Okay, and lastly, we need a noun.
Basil.

275
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,103
Proxy fight.

276
00:18:38,947 --> 00:18:41,472
Here we go.

277
00:18:43,051 --> 00:18:46,418
Lately my dad's mistresses

278
00:18:46,455 --> 00:18:50,482
are quite alfresco...

279
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:53,221
that's a great word, Calvin, okay...

280
00:18:53,261 --> 00:18:55,729
but battle cruisers like that,

281
00:18:55,764 --> 00:18:58,392
especially my snuffalupagus

282
00:18:58,433 --> 00:19:01,402
kind of booger time... what?

283
00:19:01,436 --> 00:19:04,428
-just can't gestate the proxy fight!

284
00:19:05,841 --> 00:19:07,638
What?

285
00:19:07,676 --> 00:19:09,837
You guys, what did we
just come up with?

286
00:19:11,179 --> 00:19:13,170
We are funny.
I'm glad that we don't suck.

287
00:19:13,215 --> 00:19:16,013
It's nice not to suck.

288
00:19:16,051 --> 00:19:19,020
Yeah. Don't I know it, Mernay?
Don't I know it?

289
00:19:19,054 --> 00:19:20,817
What luck not to suck

290
00:19:20,856 --> 00:19:23,324
like a duck stuck in the muck!

291
00:19:23,358 --> 00:19:24,689
Did you see what I did?

292
00:19:24,726 --> 00:19:27,251
I rhymed it.

293
00:19:29,064 --> 00:19:31,191
Oh, well.

294
00:19:31,233 --> 00:19:34,225
What's wrong, Turner?

295
00:19:34,269 --> 00:19:37,568
Well, if I just had
a little more love in this world

296
00:19:37,606 --> 00:19:39,870
then everything
would be perfect.

297
00:19:39,908 --> 00:19:41,808
But we love you.

298
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:45,079
And I love you, Basil.

299
00:19:45,113 --> 00:19:48,708
I love all you guys, honestly,
so much.

300
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,150
It's just

301
00:19:51,186 --> 00:19:53,711
I'm talking about
a different kind of love,

302
00:19:53,755 --> 00:19:57,316
the kind of love that's wet
and smells a little.

303
00:19:57,359 --> 00:20:00,851
You see, guys,
there's so much love in my heart

304
00:20:00,896 --> 00:20:04,093
that sometimes it overflows

305
00:20:04,132 --> 00:20:07,397
and all the wrong stuff
comes bursting out.

306
00:20:10,305 --> 00:20:12,136
All right, Rinaldo, all right.

307
00:20:12,173 --> 00:20:14,733
It's time for you to get hungry, okay?
It's just round three.

308
00:20:14,776 --> 00:20:17,370
You gotta take this round,
and then you got just 12 more,

309
00:20:17,412 --> 00:20:19,243
12 more rounds after this
to make it up.

310
00:20:19,281 --> 00:20:21,272
Sack up, all right?

311
00:20:45,607 --> 00:20:48,371
Oh, shit.

312
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,243
Yeah, come in.

313
00:21:13,301 --> 00:21:16,236
I don't want to be alive anymore.

314
00:21:16,271 --> 00:21:18,102
Rebecca.

315
00:21:18,139 --> 00:21:20,107
Oh my God, Tom.

316
00:21:20,141 --> 00:21:23,577
It's not poop.
It's gravy.

317
00:21:27,015 --> 00:21:29,108
Okay, that's okay. Have a seat.
There you go.

318
00:21:29,150 --> 00:21:30,617
You had a couple of good shots
in there.

319
00:21:30,652 --> 00:21:32,643
You got anything
you want to let out there?

320
00:21:32,687 --> 00:21:36,179
No? Okay.
All right, Rinaldo, listen up, okay?

321
00:21:36,224 --> 00:21:40,388
It's make-or-break time for you.
It is not just about this match.

322
00:21:40,428 --> 00:21:44,125
This is about your manhood, okay?
This is Live 101.

323
00:21:44,165 --> 00:21:47,225
If you let a girl beat you now,
they will keep beating you

324
00:21:47,268 --> 00:21:50,704
until your prostate is swollen
to the size of a pine cone

325
00:21:50,739 --> 00:21:53,401
in some Chinamen-owned Wal-Mart.
Is that what you want?

326
00:21:53,441 --> 00:21:56,274
You know what? Do you want
to end up like me and Mrs. Buchwald?

327
00:21:56,311 --> 00:21:59,041
You want to end up eating broccoli
and cheddar hot pockets

328
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,480
every morning for breakfast?
No, you do not want...

329
00:22:01,516 --> 00:22:04,644
that's a negatory, Rinaldo Retanovich.
You do not want that.

330
00:22:04,686 --> 00:22:07,484
Now I want you to get out there

331
00:22:07,522 --> 00:22:10,821
and you punch that girl, okay?

332
00:22:10,859 --> 00:22:14,955
I want you to punch her
right in her happiness, all right?

333
00:22:14,996 --> 00:22:18,227
Get up there.
All right, ring it.

334
00:22:18,333 --> 00:22:20,858
Shut us down?

335
00:22:20,935 --> 00:22:22,698
But why?

336
00:22:22,737 --> 00:22:26,173
Tom, I mean,
where do I begin?

337
00:22:26,207 --> 00:22:29,142
Well, yeah, but...

338
00:22:34,749 --> 00:22:36,410
Oh, you want one?

339
00:22:36,451 --> 00:22:39,318
Oh, no no. It's just...

340
00:22:39,354 --> 00:22:41,015
have you always smoked?

341
00:22:42,057 --> 00:22:43,547
What is this, Salem?

342
00:22:43,591 --> 00:22:46,355
Oh, no no, it's just I...

343
00:22:46,394 --> 00:22:48,954
Gonna have yourself
a little witch hunt?

344
00:22:48,997 --> 00:22:51,022
No, not at all.
Not at all.

345
00:22:51,066 --> 00:22:53,296
Look, Tom, everybody knows

346
00:22:53,334 --> 00:22:55,928
that your school has
the lowest scores in the state.

347
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:01,008
Huh-uh.
What about Petersburg Prep?

348
00:23:01,042 --> 00:23:03,272
Their scores are lower than ours.

349
00:23:03,311 --> 00:23:05,677
And everyone knows
about their heroin problem.

350
00:23:05,714 --> 00:23:09,172
Those clouds are laughing at me.

351
00:23:10,985 --> 00:23:13,385
Tie me off, bro.

352
00:23:13,421 --> 00:23:16,083
I'm sorry, Tom.

353
00:23:16,124 --> 00:23:19,184
I think my inspection
is just some sort of formality.

354
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,993
Perfect.

355
00:23:24,032 --> 00:23:27,968
I don't know anymore.

356
00:23:28,002 --> 00:23:29,993
I just wish God or whoever

357
00:23:30,038 --> 00:23:32,029
would give me
some sort of sign,

358
00:23:32,073 --> 00:23:35,042
show me what to do
with my life.

359
00:23:43,218 --> 00:23:45,345
Wow.

360
00:23:45,386 --> 00:23:48,014
You know what, though?
It all makes sense.

361
00:23:48,056 --> 00:23:49,546
This is the story of my life.

362
00:23:49,591 --> 00:23:52,253
I mean, in third grade
I wanted to be an astronaut

363
00:23:52,293 --> 00:23:54,523
and then the Challenger
blew up.

364
00:23:54,562 --> 00:23:57,690
You'll be fine.
You have a backup career, right?

365
00:23:57,732 --> 00:24:00,667
This was my second backup career.

366
00:24:00,702 --> 00:24:02,966
I've just got
to finally face it.

367
00:24:03,004 --> 00:24:04,904
I'm finished.

368
00:24:04,939 --> 00:24:06,736
Jesus, Tom,
snap out of it.

369
00:24:06,775 --> 00:24:09,209
You used to be, like,
the world's biggest optimist.

370
00:24:09,244 --> 00:24:11,712
Yeah, well, I've figured out

371
00:24:11,746 --> 00:24:14,681
that the world
has got most of us by the balls.

372
00:24:14,716 --> 00:24:17,617
All we can do is try and keep
our shrieking to a minimum.

373
00:24:17,652 --> 00:24:19,483
So turn it around.

374
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:22,115
You take the world
by the balls for a change.

375
00:24:22,157 --> 00:24:24,921
The world is just

376
00:24:24,959 --> 00:24:26,950
one giant hairy ball.

377
00:24:26,995 --> 00:24:29,293
It's so unmanageable.

378
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:32,060
Look, the district's closing
the school today

379
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,590
and something doesn't smell right.

380
00:24:33,635 --> 00:24:35,296
It's the gravy.

381
00:24:35,336 --> 00:24:39,329
No, it's Billings.
He's got something up his sleeve.

382
00:24:39,374 --> 00:24:42,138
Alas, Pangaea was no more.

383
00:24:42,177 --> 00:24:44,168
So take cover as continental drift

384
00:24:44,212 --> 00:24:48,080
continues to shake things up
all around the world.

385
00:24:48,116 --> 00:24:51,381
In conclusion, I hope
that you have all found

386
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:54,786
the phenomenon
of plate tectonics

387
00:24:54,823 --> 00:24:56,518
very moving.

388
00:25:04,465 --> 00:25:08,902
Wow, that was really great, Otis.

389
00:25:08,937 --> 00:25:12,065
I didn't assign it but, you know,
that was spectacular.

390
00:25:13,875 --> 00:25:15,308
Yes, Sarah.

391
00:25:15,343 --> 00:25:18,506
Joanne McVickers has boobs.
When will I get boobs?

392
00:25:18,546 --> 00:25:21,208
When you can afford them.

393
00:25:21,249 --> 00:25:25,709
Mrs. Buchwald, aren't you gonna
at least try to teach us something?

394
00:25:27,055 --> 00:25:28,852
Does it really matter, Frankie?

395
00:25:28,890 --> 00:25:32,485
I mean, this ain't Rutgers, okay?
It's the second grade.

396
00:25:32,527 --> 00:25:34,859
The only thing I remember
from second grade

397
00:25:34,896 --> 00:25:37,194
is my hymen breaking
during a tetherball game.

398
00:25:37,232 --> 00:25:39,223
Maybe if you'd paid more attention

399
00:25:39,267 --> 00:25:41,895
your life wouldn't have turned out
to be such total garbage.

400
00:25:41,936 --> 00:25:44,734
All right, that's it.
That's the ballgame.

401
00:25:44,772 --> 00:25:48,071
Your choice... you can either
go to the principal's office

402
00:25:48,109 --> 00:25:51,545
or I'll handcuff you
to Smelly Alice again.

403
00:25:53,047 --> 00:25:55,311
Just because you're miserable

404
00:25:55,350 --> 00:25:57,750
doesn't mean the rest of us
have to be too.

405
00:26:01,389 --> 00:26:03,880
What a sad old sack you've become,
Laura Buchwald.

406
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:10,358
Look around you, Tom.

407
00:26:10,398 --> 00:26:12,992
This isn't a Del Taco shutting down.
It's a school.

408
00:26:13,034 --> 00:26:15,161
It's an incubator
for the youth of America.

409
00:26:15,203 --> 00:26:18,036
Whatever happened to respect
for your goddamn elders?

410
00:26:18,072 --> 00:26:21,064
She just went
through a tough divorce.

411
00:26:21,109 --> 00:26:23,134
Bitch!

412
00:26:24,946 --> 00:26:28,404
Well, thanks for the pep talk,
Rebecca,

413
00:26:28,449 --> 00:26:31,816
but sometimes you've just got
to flush the baby down

414
00:26:31,853 --> 00:26:34,413
with all the other crap
in the toilet, you know?

415
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:38,952
Wanna...?

416
00:26:39,994 --> 00:26:42,963
It's Harper. Leave a message.

417
00:26:42,997 --> 00:26:45,022
Hey, Harper, it's Maurice.

418
00:26:45,066 --> 00:26:47,967
Hey, man about earlier...
I'm like...

419
00:26:48,002 --> 00:26:50,368
I don't even know
what I was thinking.

420
00:26:50,405 --> 00:26:52,339
Honestly,

421
00:26:52,373 --> 00:26:55,831
I don't ever
like beer, so...

422
00:26:55,877 --> 00:26:59,005
I mean, so yeah.

423
00:26:59,047 --> 00:27:01,914
Well, you know, I just wanted
to get that off my chest.

424
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:05,215
So I think we're good.
I think we're square.

425
00:27:05,253 --> 00:27:08,984
So call me back.
Or don't. You don't have to.

426
00:27:09,023 --> 00:27:11,924
You don't even have to
call me back, 'cause we're good.

427
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,951
Cool.

428
00:27:13,995 --> 00:27:16,020
Coolio. Holla.

429
00:27:23,438 --> 00:27:25,963
Oh, shit.
Look at her go.

430
00:27:26,007 --> 00:27:29,875
All right, all right.

431
00:28:03,911 --> 00:28:05,674
Recess!

432
00:28:05,713 --> 00:28:07,704
Recess.

433
00:28:29,737 --> 00:28:31,398
Not again.

434
00:28:34,876 --> 00:28:37,902
Hey, that punk didn't pay you
for your smack.

435
00:28:37,945 --> 00:28:40,140
Dang!

436
00:28:40,181 --> 00:28:43,742
I'm gonna blow his brains out.
Pow pow pow!

437
00:28:43,785 --> 00:28:46,049
What the hell are they doing?

438
00:28:46,087 --> 00:28:49,716
Oh, just playing a little drive-by.

439
00:28:52,193 --> 00:28:56,027
They took all the rock-climbing walls
after the lawsuit, so...

440
00:28:56,064 --> 00:28:58,862
And you're okay with all this?

441
00:29:00,101 --> 00:29:02,831
The school's getting
shut down anyway, right?

442
00:29:07,375 --> 00:29:09,969
Remember when we had
kick-boxing in fourth grade

443
00:29:10,011 --> 00:29:13,242
and that douche bag Matt Bonner
beat the crap out of me?

444
00:29:13,281 --> 00:29:16,546
It was you that said,
"Nothing is impossible.

445
00:29:16,584 --> 00:29:18,609
Go down fighting."

446
00:29:21,923 --> 00:29:24,483
I still have that weird click
in my knee from when he took me out,

447
00:29:24,525 --> 00:29:26,516
but you were right...

448
00:29:26,561 --> 00:29:28,927
in theory or something.

449
00:29:28,963 --> 00:29:33,332
The point is, Tom,
don't give up on these kids.

450
00:29:35,436 --> 00:29:37,836
Sorry, is that...?

451
00:29:37,872 --> 00:29:40,397
Pain pills.

452
00:29:40,441 --> 00:29:42,170
I have back problems.

453
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,235
And the...?

454
00:29:45,947 --> 00:29:48,745
It's whiskey, Tom. I have to
wash it down with something.

455
00:29:50,685 --> 00:29:52,676
What, is this Nuremberg?

456
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:57,521
It's not like I'm rendering fat of Jews
to make soap and candles.

457
00:29:57,558 --> 00:30:00,049
So?

458
00:30:01,996 --> 00:30:04,658
Okay, fine.
If it'll make you happy

459
00:30:04,699 --> 00:30:07,099
I'll go speak with the faculty.

460
00:30:07,135 --> 00:30:09,467
I don't think it's gonna do
any good.

461
00:30:37,965 --> 00:30:40,991
It just took me a while
to come to terms with it, you know?

462
00:30:41,035 --> 00:30:43,026
Maybe she was a guy,

463
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:44,799
maybe she was a girl,

464
00:30:44,839 --> 00:30:47,399
but at the end of the day

465
00:30:47,441 --> 00:30:50,376
why am I gonna get so upset
about a blowjob?

466
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:54,548
Hey, everybody.

467
00:30:56,017 --> 00:30:59,145
Hey, you guys, if I can
get your attention just for a...

468
00:30:59,187 --> 00:31:02,179
hi!

469
00:31:02,223 --> 00:31:05,420
I... I have some bad news

470
00:31:05,459 --> 00:31:07,723
to share with everyone.

471
00:31:07,762 --> 00:31:10,424
The district
might shut us down today.

472
00:31:12,867 --> 00:31:15,131
Okay, maybe you guys
didn't hear me.

473
00:31:15,169 --> 00:31:19,162
Geraldine Ferraro might shut down,

474
00:31:19,207 --> 00:31:20,936
and permanently this time,

475
00:31:20,975 --> 00:31:24,308
not like that incident with Diarrhea Teddy
and the hazmat team.

476
00:31:24,345 --> 00:31:26,506
That was great.

477
00:31:26,547 --> 00:31:29,072
Now look, I don't want to have to
assert myself...

478
00:31:29,116 --> 00:31:31,676
Assert yourself?
With what authority?

479
00:31:33,788 --> 00:31:36,279
Haven't you figured it out, Tom?

480
00:31:36,324 --> 00:31:39,054
You're a figurehead, a veep.

481
00:31:39,093 --> 00:31:41,084
You're Spiro fucking Agnew.

482
00:31:41,128 --> 00:31:42,959
All hat and no cattle, Tommy.

483
00:31:42,997 --> 00:31:45,966
Okay, I'm just trying to help.

484
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,093
Well, we don't need your help.

485
00:31:48,135 --> 00:31:50,763
What do you think will happen
to the school if it's shuttered, huh?

486
00:31:50,805 --> 00:31:52,796
You think we'll lose our jobs?

487
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,708
Well, I got tenure, bitch.
We all have,

488
00:31:56,744 --> 00:31:58,735
except for two people...

489
00:31:58,779 --> 00:32:01,407
this guy

490
00:32:01,449 --> 00:32:04,247
and you, Tom.

491
00:32:04,285 --> 00:32:07,448
Keep your nose in the roses
and out of the smelly stuff.

492
00:32:07,488 --> 00:32:10,218
You're the smelly stuff?

493
00:32:10,258 --> 00:32:13,591
Yeah, I'm the smelliest stuff
there is, Tom,

494
00:32:13,628 --> 00:32:16,324
the smelliest stuff
this side of Dixie.

495
00:32:16,364 --> 00:32:18,161
Guess what side of Dixie
we're on.

496
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:28,267
So that was useless.

497
00:32:29,477 --> 00:32:32,344
Are you just gonna stop there?
What would your father say?

498
00:32:33,748 --> 00:32:34,908
That's a low blow.

499
00:32:34,949 --> 00:32:38,680
Maybe it wasn't low enough.
What would your dead father say?

500
00:32:38,719 --> 00:32:40,277
Jesus, Rebecca.

501
00:32:40,321 --> 00:32:43,518
"Jesus, Rebecca" yourself.
Get angry, Tom.

502
00:32:43,557 --> 00:32:45,991
What does it take
to rile you up anymore?

503
00:32:46,027 --> 00:32:47,961
What happened to you that day?

504
00:32:47,995 --> 00:32:49,758
I don't want to talk about it.

505
00:32:56,604 --> 00:32:58,697
Hey.

506
00:32:58,739 --> 00:33:00,297
Thanks for the grapefruit.

507
00:33:00,341 --> 00:33:02,775
It was the best ever.

508
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:07,338
Oh, you're welcome, Adelle.

509
00:33:07,381 --> 00:33:09,975
I like you.
And you smell good.

510
00:33:10,017 --> 00:33:11,985
Daddy smells like bourbon.

511
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:16,456
Well, I'm sure that doesn't change
how much he loves you.

512
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:19,220
Nuh-uh. He wrote a song called

513
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:23,287
"Social Worker, Social Worker,
Come Take Adelle Away."

514
00:33:24,398 --> 00:33:27,231
You're not like him.
You're super-duper nice.

515
00:33:27,268 --> 00:33:30,362
Well, I think you're nice too, Adelle.

516
00:33:31,806 --> 00:33:34,172
Whoa whoa whoa.
But we still can't hug.

517
00:33:34,208 --> 00:33:37,268
Sorry.
We get lawsuits. We get law...

518
00:33:37,311 --> 00:33:39,006
she knows we get lawsuits.

519
00:33:43,084 --> 00:33:45,416
You set that up, didn't you?

520
00:33:46,654 --> 00:33:49,555
No, Tom, songs like that
are sung every night.

521
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:55,251
Okay, all right.

522
00:33:57,264 --> 00:34:00,131
If this school's going down,
I'm going down with it.

523
00:34:00,167 --> 00:34:02,192
I've got nothing to lose.

524
00:34:02,236 --> 00:34:05,603
But on one condition...
you're in this with me.

525
00:34:05,639 --> 00:34:09,700
Tom, I'm here to inspect you,
not save your ass.

526
00:34:09,744 --> 00:34:13,077
I could lose my job.
I will... I will lose my job.

527
00:34:13,114 --> 00:34:15,309
That's exactly why no one else
is helping me.

528
00:34:15,349 --> 00:34:19,046
I can't do this alone.
I need you.

529
00:34:23,424 --> 00:34:25,892
Fuck a duck.

530
00:34:27,027 --> 00:34:29,154
-I'm in.
-Yeah!

531
00:34:29,196 --> 00:34:31,721
Okay. Okay.

532
00:34:31,766 --> 00:34:34,132
Yeah.

533
00:34:34,168 --> 00:34:35,760
Okay.

534
00:34:35,803 --> 00:34:39,637
A plan... we need a plan.

535
00:34:44,945 --> 00:34:47,846
Right.

536
00:34:47,882 --> 00:34:51,010
Well, we've got about five hours
until school's out,

537
00:34:51,051 --> 00:34:54,543
so this whole "Cat's Cradle" thing
you just drew isn't gonna happen.

538
00:34:58,459 --> 00:35:00,984
Okay. Okay, here it is:

539
00:35:01,028 --> 00:35:04,122
First we rally the faculty.

540
00:35:04,165 --> 00:35:06,599
They've got to teach their hearts out
starting today.

541
00:35:06,634 --> 00:35:08,795
-Then we to to stage two.
-Which is...?

542
00:35:08,836 --> 00:35:10,827
We stage a walkout

543
00:35:10,871 --> 00:35:12,668
right at the end of school.

544
00:35:12,706 --> 00:35:14,037
How's that gonna help?

545
00:35:14,074 --> 00:35:16,201
Because I'm gonna call the media
right before.

546
00:35:16,243 --> 00:35:17,642
Make the news van show up,

547
00:35:17,678 --> 00:35:20,010
splash the kids
across the 11:00 broadcast...

548
00:35:20,047 --> 00:35:22,777
there's no way they'll shut us down.

549
00:35:22,817 --> 00:35:25,047
And all the teachers
who don't give a shit now

550
00:35:25,085 --> 00:35:29,078
will change their tune if they know
a camera's gonna be in their faces.

551
00:35:30,124 --> 00:35:33,287
Melody, send it Fowler.

552
00:35:35,362 --> 00:35:38,354
Have a seat, Fowler.

553
00:35:42,903 --> 00:35:46,999
-I'm innocent, Billings.
-Yeah, heard that song before.

554
00:35:48,175 --> 00:35:50,575
You know the drill.

555
00:35:55,049 --> 00:35:57,517
Do you want to get suspended?

556
00:36:09,463 --> 00:36:12,796
What's going on?

557
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:16,166
Are you clearing out of here?

558
00:36:17,938 --> 00:36:20,338
You know what, Fowler?

559
00:36:21,375 --> 00:36:24,435
I'm feeling felicitous today.
Let me give that back to you.

560
00:36:24,478 --> 00:36:28,278
Why don't we just both pretend
you were never in here?

561
00:36:31,085 --> 00:36:33,553
Actually, let's go halfsies.
Give me back that 10 spot.

562
00:36:34,788 --> 00:36:36,881
Yeah.

563
00:36:39,860 --> 00:36:43,990
People are talking, Frankie.
Shit's about to go down.

564
00:36:44,031 --> 00:36:46,022
What's that got to do with me?

565
00:36:47,034 --> 00:36:49,901
It's Billings, Frankie.
He's selling us out for the big game.

566
00:36:49,937 --> 00:36:52,132
Jesus H!

567
00:36:52,172 --> 00:36:54,265
I know we've had our differences
in the past.

568
00:36:54,308 --> 00:36:56,299
Yes, Bartlett, we have.

569
00:36:59,413 --> 00:37:03,543
And that's it, baby.
That's long division.

570
00:37:03,584 --> 00:37:07,543
Oh, Bartlett, you're everything
a man should be.

571
00:37:07,588 --> 00:37:10,580
Tell me again about remainders.

572
00:37:10,624 --> 00:37:13,821
No, Frankie, no!
It's not what you think! No!

573
00:37:13,861 --> 00:37:15,556
Bonecracker!

574
00:37:15,596 --> 00:37:18,190
Hard to believe
that was just yesterday.

575
00:37:18,232 --> 00:37:21,531
We can't let them close the school.
I don't know what I'll do, Frankie.

576
00:37:21,569 --> 00:37:24,003
I have a wife and kids
to think about.

577
00:37:24,038 --> 00:37:25,266
You do?

578
00:37:25,306 --> 00:37:27,274
Not yet, but someday.

579
00:37:27,308 --> 00:37:29,105
You have to get word out.

580
00:37:30,277 --> 00:37:32,302
Take this.

581
00:37:32,346 --> 00:37:34,109
We're all counting on you, Fowler.

582
00:37:34,148 --> 00:37:36,309
Forget our past.

583
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:38,818
I'll do what I can, Bartlett,

584
00:37:38,852 --> 00:37:41,753
but I'll never forget our past.

585
00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:50,991
That's the thing, though, you know?
You give and you give

586
00:37:51,031 --> 00:37:52,999
and you give.
And what do they do?

587
00:37:53,033 --> 00:37:55,627
Take it. They take take take.

588
00:37:55,669 --> 00:37:58,797
Even still, we need the ladies.

589
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:01,399
Honest to goodness,
we need 'em.

590
00:38:01,442 --> 00:38:03,273
God bless 'em,
every last one of 'em.

591
00:38:03,310 --> 00:38:07,178
I know I needed Mrs. Buchwald,
but not anymore, though.

592
00:38:09,550 --> 00:38:11,643
Maybe you're right.
Maybe I do. I don't know.

593
00:38:11,685 --> 00:38:13,676
I can't hear you, Mr. Buchwald.

594
00:38:13,721 --> 00:38:16,121
I think my brain is bleeding.

595
00:38:16,156 --> 00:38:18,317
I want you to listen to me.

596
00:38:19,627 --> 00:38:21,219
Are you listening?

597
00:38:21,261 --> 00:38:25,925
Do not marry young,

598
00:38:25,966 --> 00:38:30,369
'cause right now you're shit.

599
00:38:30,404 --> 00:38:33,396
You're a zygote.
You may think you're hot stuff,

600
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,375
but out there in the real world
you want to know what you are?

601
00:38:36,410 --> 00:38:40,471
Bang. Zero.
That's you. Look at that. You.

602
00:38:40,514 --> 00:38:44,473
But in a few years you might
begin to bark instead of just yap.

603
00:38:44,518 --> 00:38:47,214
A few years more...
you begin to snarl and growl.

604
00:38:47,254 --> 00:38:50,018
But what if you're stuck
with some cooze

605
00:38:50,057 --> 00:38:53,891
that you shacked up with back when
you were just a little yapping yapper?

606
00:38:53,927 --> 00:38:56,487
I mean, what the fuck?
Does that compute?

607
00:38:56,530 --> 00:38:59,192
What the fuck is wrong
with this world?

608
00:38:59,233 --> 00:39:00,894
Does it make any sense to you?

609
00:39:00,934 --> 00:39:03,994
No! Thank you!
No, it doesn't.

610
00:39:04,038 --> 00:39:06,370
Okay, amigo, good talk.

611
00:39:06,407 --> 00:39:08,398
Up you get.

612
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,738
Oh!

613
00:39:18,285 --> 00:39:20,480
Nurse Gretchen.

614
00:39:22,356 --> 00:39:24,654
Nurse Gretchen!

615
00:39:24,692 --> 00:39:26,887
Yes, Mr. Abernathy.

616
00:39:30,030 --> 00:39:32,521
-Sorry?
-What?

617
00:39:32,566 --> 00:39:35,228
What did you say?
You said something.

618
00:39:35,269 --> 00:39:38,204
No, you said, "Sorry?"
What?

619
00:39:38,238 --> 00:39:40,069
No, you tried to say something
and I said, "What?"

620
00:39:40,107 --> 00:39:42,234
And then you said, "What?"
But you were gonna say something.

621
00:39:42,276 --> 00:39:43,709
So what did you say?

622
00:39:43,744 --> 00:39:45,905
No, you said, "Sorry?"
And then I said, "What?"

623
00:39:45,946 --> 00:39:50,280
And then I said, "You just say
what you said." What?

624
00:39:50,317 --> 00:39:52,547
I said, "You said, 'What? '
And I said, 'What?"'

625
00:39:52,586 --> 00:39:54,577
And then now
I'm saying "What?" again,

626
00:39:54,621 --> 00:39:57,089
as in, like, what are you talk...?
What?

627
00:39:57,124 --> 00:39:59,524
-What?
-Sorry.

628
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:01,551
Okay, come on, hon.

629
00:40:01,595 --> 00:40:04,462
Um, I have Dip Dip.

630
00:40:04,498 --> 00:40:06,363
Yeah, I see that.

631
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:11,069
You have some.

632
00:40:11,105 --> 00:40:14,131
No, thank you.

633
00:40:14,174 --> 00:40:16,369
I actually think
his brain is hemorrhaging.

634
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:19,174
So I'm gonna take him
to the nurse's office, okay?

635
00:40:19,213 --> 00:40:21,443
Oh, okay.

636
00:40:23,283 --> 00:40:25,478
Yeah, whatevs.

637
00:40:25,519 --> 00:40:29,216
I'll just chill. Lates.

638
00:40:29,256 --> 00:40:31,281
No bigs.

639
00:40:47,674 --> 00:40:50,939
-Oh, darn it all.
-Stinks.

640
00:40:58,485 --> 00:41:00,476
Hey, Harper, it's Maurice.

641
00:41:00,521 --> 00:41:04,981
Um, we got off
on the wrong foot on my last message

642
00:41:05,025 --> 00:41:09,155
and I just... I feel like...

643
00:41:09,196 --> 00:41:11,528
why aren't you
calling me back?

644
00:41:11,565 --> 00:41:13,089
What's...?

645
00:41:13,133 --> 00:41:15,465
Why not?

646
00:41:15,502 --> 00:41:18,130
I mean, I'm leaving you messages.

647
00:41:18,172 --> 00:41:21,073
Usually that elicits
a callback.

648
00:41:21,108 --> 00:41:23,099
So think about it.

649
00:41:25,312 --> 00:41:28,440
So we'll turn this corner
and wind up right here.

650
00:41:28,515 --> 00:41:30,813
Now I'll cover the north side.

651
00:41:30,851 --> 00:41:32,842
You cover the portables
and the east side.

652
00:41:32,886 --> 00:41:35,912
If we round up enough teachers
with clean underwear by lunch

653
00:41:35,956 --> 00:41:37,947
we'll call the news.

654
00:41:40,394 --> 00:41:41,520
What?

655
00:41:41,562 --> 00:41:43,860
Nothing. It's just
for a second there

656
00:41:43,897 --> 00:41:46,627
I saw a little bit
of your father in you.

657
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:49,397
-Tom, what happened that day?
-Shh!

658
00:41:51,672 --> 00:41:54,505
Let's not dig up old graves, okay?

659
00:41:58,912 --> 00:42:00,937
Let's go save the future.

660
00:42:03,116 --> 00:42:06,950
Oh, you precocious little bastards,

661
00:42:06,987 --> 00:42:09,717
weaned on your chocolate
breakfast cereals

662
00:42:09,756 --> 00:42:11,747
and your Hannah Montana,

663
00:42:11,792 --> 00:42:14,158
dressing as though you want
to be raped

664
00:42:14,194 --> 00:42:16,287
by a professional
basketball player.

665
00:42:16,330 --> 00:42:18,764
Oh, shame on the lot of you.
Shame.

666
00:42:18,799 --> 00:42:20,824
What?

667
00:42:20,868 --> 00:42:23,268
Old Curt, a word, please.

668
00:42:26,206 --> 00:42:28,640
Fine, no more
Sponge Bob videos.

669
00:42:28,675 --> 00:42:31,041
And?

670
00:42:32,179 --> 00:42:34,477
And no more giving them
shots of Nyquil

671
00:42:34,514 --> 00:42:37,677
so I can sit and read my "Us Weekly"
in fucking peace and quiet.

672
00:42:37,718 --> 00:42:40,551
That's the spirit.

673
00:42:40,587 --> 00:42:42,179
Bitch.

674
00:42:50,163 --> 00:42:54,600
It's time to rally my angels.

675
00:42:55,903 --> 00:43:00,306
The periodic table of elements...
what everything is made of,

676
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:03,036
what you are made of,
and me.

677
00:43:04,912 --> 00:43:07,642
Okay, hot hands.
Your scraper and your scraper.

678
00:43:07,681 --> 00:43:09,444
All right, go for it.
Have fun in there.

679
00:43:09,483 --> 00:43:11,542
School spirit.
School spirit.

680
00:43:19,993 --> 00:43:21,585
Salute me.

681
00:43:28,402 --> 00:43:30,666
Who told you to do this?

682
00:43:30,704 --> 00:43:32,501
Vice Principal Willoman.

683
00:43:32,539 --> 00:43:35,007
Yeah, he's trying
to make the school better.

684
00:43:35,042 --> 00:43:38,443
Oh. Oh.

685
00:43:38,478 --> 00:43:40,343
Really?

686
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:42,371
Then what if I told you

687
00:43:42,416 --> 00:43:44,941
that your dad makes hot sauce
out of dolphin fetuses?

688
00:43:44,985 --> 00:43:47,977
Nuh-uh. Papa works at the mill.

689
00:43:48,021 --> 00:43:49,955
Exactly.
And by that same logic,

690
00:43:49,990 --> 00:43:52,117
Vice Principal Willoman
is a big fat liar.

691
00:43:52,159 --> 00:43:55,253
Now get back to class!

692
00:44:16,750 --> 00:44:19,116
Is this the best you have?

693
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,151
Of course it is.

694
00:44:28,895 --> 00:44:32,296
Pretty boy...

695
00:44:35,535 --> 00:44:37,696
ponytails...

696
00:44:46,179 --> 00:44:49,444
fat person...

697
00:44:53,587 --> 00:44:56,852
and flute...

698
00:44:58,225 --> 00:45:00,250
follow me.

699
00:45:05,265 --> 00:45:08,325
You guys want a job?

700
00:45:08,368 --> 00:45:09,665
Like, for money?

701
00:45:09,703 --> 00:45:11,694
Of course for money.

702
00:45:11,738 --> 00:45:14,036
I need you to follow me around

703
00:45:14,074 --> 00:45:16,565
playing your little instruments.

704
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:18,510
I don't even think that's legal.

705
00:45:18,545 --> 00:45:21,378
Hey, look up here.
Look at me.

706
00:45:21,415 --> 00:45:23,440
Shut up.

707
00:45:23,483 --> 00:45:26,247
You want five bucks
for the afternoon or not?

708
00:45:26,286 --> 00:45:28,345
Okay.

709
00:45:38,432 --> 00:45:41,299
I also want a Fruitsy Pop.

710
00:45:44,171 --> 00:45:46,332
Fruitsy Pops all around.

711
00:46:07,160 --> 00:46:09,253
Students and faculty,
listen up.

712
00:46:09,296 --> 00:46:12,231
This is your principal.
It has come to my attention

713
00:46:12,265 --> 00:46:15,200
that certain subversive elements
are planning a walkout,

714
00:46:15,235 --> 00:46:18,796
instigating some kind of
weird-ass leftist pinko coup d'état.

715
00:46:18,839 --> 00:46:22,070
Any such attempt will be immediately met

716
00:46:22,109 --> 00:46:23,804
with a schoolwide lockdown.

717
00:46:23,844 --> 00:46:25,607
Everyone will be confined

718
00:46:25,645 --> 00:46:28,512
for an indefinite time,
except for Scotty Hendricks.

719
00:46:28,548 --> 00:46:30,675
Scotty, the TB test was positive.

720
00:46:30,717 --> 00:46:32,878
Please leave campus immediately.

721
00:46:32,919 --> 00:46:37,379
Donovan sat at the window
of his small shack, motionless.

722
00:46:37,424 --> 00:46:40,154
There was loneliness
all around him,

723
00:46:40,193 --> 00:46:42,354
shrouding him like a shroud.

724
00:46:42,395 --> 00:46:46,331
And from the abandoned
sawmill nearby... yes, he hears it...

725
00:46:46,366 --> 00:46:49,631
the faint yet unmistakable sound

726
00:46:49,669 --> 00:46:51,660
of a dog raping a cat.

727
00:46:56,676 --> 00:46:58,769
Yeah, Zippy.

728
00:47:00,881 --> 00:47:03,907
Imelda and I have something
to share.

729
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:06,077
Okay, go ahead, Zip.

730
00:47:06,119 --> 00:47:08,485
We're pregnant.

731
00:47:11,591 --> 00:47:16,654
Well, that is just great.

732
00:47:16,696 --> 00:47:19,392
Come on, guys.
Show them how you feel.

733
00:47:20,867 --> 00:47:22,391
All right!

734
00:47:22,435 --> 00:47:26,303
You guys are gonna need
some serious prenatal action.

735
00:47:28,341 --> 00:47:31,504
Yes, Nurse Gretchen, please.

736
00:47:32,812 --> 00:47:34,803
Hey, wait, what are you doing?

737
00:47:34,848 --> 00:47:36,679
No no no.

738
00:47:36,716 --> 00:47:38,946
The show goes on.
The show goes on.

739
00:47:38,985 --> 00:47:41,351
Show must go on.

740
00:47:41,388 --> 00:47:44,880
So I have some news.

741
00:47:44,925 --> 00:47:48,759
Imelda is not pregnant.

742
00:47:48,795 --> 00:47:51,229
Did you kill our baby?

743
00:47:51,264 --> 00:47:54,028
No, I didn't kill your baby.

744
00:47:54,067 --> 00:47:56,763
There wasn't a baby.

745
00:47:56,803 --> 00:48:00,762
Do you guys know
how babies are made?

746
00:48:00,807 --> 00:48:04,072
You don't, do you?

747
00:48:05,745 --> 00:48:08,680
Let's get you guys
back to class.

748
00:48:08,715 --> 00:48:10,706
Come on.

749
00:48:33,573 --> 00:48:35,734
Awesome.

750
00:48:35,775 --> 00:48:38,107
Thank God you're back.

751
00:48:40,113 --> 00:48:42,274
Okay, Laura, let's cut the crap.

752
00:48:42,315 --> 00:48:47,343
The school's taking in water
and Billings is abandoning ship,

753
00:48:47,387 --> 00:48:50,515
but not before
he's picked all our pockets.

754
00:48:50,557 --> 00:48:52,923
We need Vice Principal Willoman.

755
00:48:56,029 --> 00:48:58,793
Right, Sally,
that's why we read.

756
00:48:58,832 --> 00:49:00,629
Nurse Gretchen.

757
00:49:00,667 --> 00:49:02,259
Mr. Abernathy, hi.

758
00:49:02,302 --> 00:49:04,702
Uh, when is she due?

759
00:49:04,738 --> 00:49:08,640
Mr. Abernathy, Imelda isn't pregnant.

760
00:49:08,675 --> 00:49:11,269
And I'm not quite sure
that Zippy and Imelda

761
00:49:11,311 --> 00:49:15,270
really understand
where babies come from.

762
00:49:15,315 --> 00:49:17,909
Oh.

763
00:49:17,951 --> 00:49:22,854
Well, maybe they could take
a sex ed class with you.

764
00:49:22,889 --> 00:49:25,949
Well, I guess that couldn't hurt.

765
00:49:25,992 --> 00:49:27,823
Maybe we could all go.

766
00:49:27,861 --> 00:49:31,160
Well, I suppose.

767
00:49:31,197 --> 00:49:34,189
-Oh, hell yes! Yes!
-Yeah!

768
00:49:34,234 --> 00:49:36,293
Right? Yes!

769
00:49:36,336 --> 00:49:38,998
I'll see you guys later.

770
00:49:39,039 --> 00:49:41,030
Oh, I want to do her so bad.

771
00:49:41,074 --> 00:49:44,703
I want to do it so hard.
She is it.

772
00:50:09,302 --> 00:50:11,293
You smell that?

773
00:50:11,338 --> 00:50:14,603
Asparagus. Putrid.

774
00:50:14,641 --> 00:50:17,235
The way a man's piss
should smell, though.

775
00:50:24,851 --> 00:50:26,580
Flush me.

776
00:50:26,619 --> 00:50:28,177
No. Flush yourself.

777
00:50:28,221 --> 00:50:31,622
I warned you, Tom.
I told you to stay out of my way,

778
00:50:31,658 --> 00:50:33,853
but you had to go
the hero route, didn't you?

779
00:50:33,893 --> 00:50:37,124
Look, I'm not gonna stand by

780
00:50:37,163 --> 00:50:39,131
and watch the school
get shut down, Harper.

781
00:50:39,165 --> 00:50:41,497
Yes, you are.
Yes, you are.

782
00:50:44,337 --> 00:50:47,773
Because I'm the only one
that can save you, Tom.

783
00:50:47,807 --> 00:50:51,538
You're just a bright-eyed little fluffer
in this titty flick.

784
00:50:51,578 --> 00:50:55,605
But turns out you and I...
we aren't so different.

785
00:50:55,648 --> 00:50:58,116
What are you getting at, Harper?

786
00:50:58,151 --> 00:51:01,279
We're both waiting
for the same bus.

787
00:51:01,321 --> 00:51:03,414
And I can bequeath unto you

788
00:51:03,456 --> 00:51:06,391
the magic coins
to ride on that bus.

789
00:51:08,328 --> 00:51:12,094
How would you like to be principal
of Valley Hilltop Elementary?

790
00:51:13,099 --> 00:51:14,828
Principal?

791
00:51:14,868 --> 00:51:16,495
Yeah.

792
00:51:16,536 --> 00:51:19,767
This all ends right here and now, Tom.
Just say the word.

793
00:51:21,641 --> 00:51:23,802
You'll never be the man
your father was, Tom.

794
00:51:24,944 --> 00:51:27,242
Yeah yeah.

795
00:51:29,048 --> 00:51:31,676
I know what happened that day.

796
00:51:34,988 --> 00:51:38,685
Fact is, you don't have the guts
to stand up to me and you know it.

797
00:51:38,725 --> 00:51:40,716
So take the bait

798
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:42,955
and flush my goddamn urinal.

799
00:51:50,336 --> 00:51:52,600
No.

800
00:51:52,639 --> 00:51:55,972
No, I don't think so, Harper.

801
00:51:56,009 --> 00:51:58,000
I don't know what you're up to,

802
00:51:58,044 --> 00:52:00,604
but it's as crooked
as Arianna Pollard.

803
00:52:01,948 --> 00:52:05,213
The scoliosis girl.

804
00:52:05,251 --> 00:52:08,345
Good one.
You're on fire today.

805
00:52:08,455 --> 00:52:11,982
Well, you can't say
you didn't make your own bed, Tommy.

806
00:52:12,025 --> 00:52:14,619
Now you gotta lie in it.

807
00:52:14,661 --> 00:52:17,027
The problem is,
you sewed your sheets together

808
00:52:17,063 --> 00:52:20,658
out of moldy rainbows
and day-old dreamy-dreams.

809
00:52:20,700 --> 00:52:22,691
I don't know what that means.

810
00:52:22,735 --> 00:52:24,726
It's poetry, Tom.

811
00:52:24,771 --> 00:52:27,069
You don't have to know what it means.
It sounds good.

812
00:52:29,075 --> 00:52:31,407
You know what else
sound good?

813
00:52:50,430 --> 00:52:53,263
You just don't listen
to reason, do ya, Agnew?

814
00:52:53,299 --> 00:52:56,029
What are you guys gonna do,
beat me up?

815
00:52:56,069 --> 00:52:58,401
No, we're gonna beat you down.

816
00:53:11,985 --> 00:53:13,976
Yoo-hoo.
Are you ready for us?

817
00:53:14,020 --> 00:53:16,580
-Yeah, come on in.
-Okay, cool.

818
00:53:16,623 --> 00:53:18,557
Come on, single file, guys.

819
00:53:18,591 --> 00:53:21,560
Remember your buddy.
Let's go.

820
00:53:21,594 --> 00:53:25,257
Welcome to
"Coital Danger 17:

821
00:53:25,298 --> 00:53:27,596
Trouble at the Drive-In."

822
00:53:29,369 --> 00:53:33,032
Kids, you already know by now
that sex is really bad for you,

823
00:53:33,072 --> 00:53:35,199
but just how bad?

824
00:53:35,241 --> 00:53:37,232
Well, here we see Dingles

825
00:53:37,277 --> 00:53:39,609
on his way to a drive-in
motion picture

826
00:53:39,646 --> 00:53:41,546
with his gal-pal Cassandra...

827
00:53:41,581 --> 00:53:44,709
I have fruit.

828
00:53:45,952 --> 00:53:47,249
To eat.

829
00:53:47,287 --> 00:53:49,949
Oh, great.

830
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,894
Cassandra is
what we call loose...

831
00:53:58,231 --> 00:54:01,098
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

832
00:54:02,802 --> 00:54:04,929
Thank you for saying
"You're welcome."

833
00:54:06,940 --> 00:54:08,931
You're welcome.

834
00:54:08,975 --> 00:54:10,840
Thank you.

835
00:54:10,877 --> 00:54:13,345
We'll answer
that question a little bit later,

836
00:54:13,379 --> 00:54:16,075
but for now let's get back
to Dingles and Cassandra.

837
00:54:16,115 --> 00:54:18,845
And there they are
on a fast ride

838
00:54:18,885 --> 00:54:21,649
to their deplorable fate.

839
00:54:35,068 --> 00:54:38,128
AJ?

840
00:54:38,171 --> 00:54:40,162
AJ, is that you?

841
00:54:40,206 --> 00:54:42,197
Yeah, it's me.

842
00:54:42,241 --> 00:54:44,835
AJ, hey, buddy.

843
00:54:44,877 --> 00:54:47,345
It's Vice Principal Willoman.
I need you to untie me.

844
00:54:47,380 --> 00:54:51,646
No, you're a dirty stranger.
You want to touch my bathroom parts.

845
00:54:51,684 --> 00:54:53,515
What? No, AJ.

846
00:54:53,553 --> 00:54:55,384
AJ?

847
00:54:55,421 --> 00:54:57,912
AJ, no, I want nothing to do
with your bathroom parts!

848
00:54:57,957 --> 00:55:00,517
AJ! AJ.

849
00:55:04,030 --> 00:55:05,190
Hey.

850
00:55:05,231 --> 00:55:07,222
Fondue?

851
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:13,969
I still love her, Dougray.

852
00:55:14,007 --> 00:55:16,271
I'm still mad about that woman.

853
00:55:20,346 --> 00:55:23,782
Look at my life.
What a dump.

854
00:55:23,816 --> 00:55:27,775
My great grandfather invented
the two-point conversion, Dougray.

855
00:55:27,820 --> 00:55:29,720
What the f...?

856
00:55:30,890 --> 00:55:33,450
What the fuck have I ever done?

857
00:55:38,031 --> 00:55:41,091
It's probably suicide time, huh?

858
00:55:41,134 --> 00:55:42,692
Yeah.

859
00:55:43,703 --> 00:55:46,035
Damn it.

860
00:55:46,072 --> 00:55:48,734
Tom's been missing
for the last hour.

861
00:55:48,775 --> 00:55:51,005
Keep it together.

862
00:55:51,044 --> 00:55:53,945
There's only one person
who can help us find him.

863
00:55:53,980 --> 00:55:56,448
Yes, Laura,

864
00:55:56,482 --> 00:55:58,575
you know it as well as I do.

865
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:03,648
He's the only one of us
who's trained to kill.

866
00:56:03,690 --> 00:56:05,555
That's true.

867
00:56:06,759 --> 00:56:09,250
He once had a fire in his heart...

868
00:56:09,295 --> 00:56:11,456
...a fire that saved people

869
00:56:11,497 --> 00:56:13,556
by killing other people.

870
00:56:15,635 --> 00:56:17,830
And I extinguished
that fire.

871
00:56:22,742 --> 00:56:24,733
I'm such a cunt.

872
00:56:24,777 --> 00:56:26,267
Pull yourself together.

873
00:56:26,312 --> 00:56:30,009
This big outhouse you call
an elementary school is about to go down,

874
00:56:30,049 --> 00:56:32,745
and I'm not about to be bussed
to Roosevelt County

875
00:56:32,785 --> 00:56:35,219
so I can be sodomized every day
for my lunch money.

876
00:56:35,254 --> 00:56:38,621
This isn't about your marriage
and it's not about your pride.

877
00:56:38,658 --> 00:56:40,956
It's about our future.

878
00:56:40,993 --> 00:56:43,757
You're right, Frankie.
You're right.

879
00:56:43,796 --> 00:56:46,629
Jesse is the only chance
we've got.

880
00:56:46,666 --> 00:56:50,033
Or, you know, he's the only chance
we've got to find Tom

881
00:56:50,069 --> 00:56:52,401
who is really the only chance
we've got.

882
00:56:52,438 --> 00:56:54,235
Then make it happen, lady.

883
00:56:54,273 --> 00:56:57,265
Make it happen.

884
00:57:07,754 --> 00:57:09,654
Yello.

885
00:57:09,689 --> 00:57:11,384
Bueno bueno.

886
00:57:11,424 --> 00:57:13,688
It's me, Jesse.

887
00:57:13,726 --> 00:57:16,251
Laura,

888
00:57:16,295 --> 00:57:19,128
my lover, my everything.

889
00:57:19,165 --> 00:57:20,996
Listen,

890
00:57:21,033 --> 00:57:23,627
there's no time for pillow talk,
sweet nuts.

891
00:57:23,669 --> 00:57:26,069
You've got to be the man
I've never let you be,

892
00:57:26,105 --> 00:57:27,436
the man
you've always been,

893
00:57:27,473 --> 00:57:29,998
mostly always.

894
00:57:30,042 --> 00:57:32,033
Jesse, we've got to find Tom.

895
00:57:32,078 --> 00:57:35,707
If we don't, the school's a goner,
and us and the kids along with it.

896
00:57:35,748 --> 00:57:38,444
Now you keep this as quiet
as a fairy fart,

897
00:57:38,484 --> 00:57:40,577
but we need to break Tom free.

898
00:57:40,620 --> 00:57:44,021
And then we've got
to take Billings down!

899
00:57:45,491 --> 00:57:47,482
The fact is, kids,

900
00:57:47,527 --> 00:57:50,087
that filthy movies
and television programs

901
00:57:50,129 --> 00:57:53,189
influence your young mind,
causing you to do things

902
00:57:53,232 --> 00:57:56,531
that will lead to ghastly physical
and emotional scars.

903
00:57:56,569 --> 00:57:59,504
Dingles, watch out!

904
00:57:59,539 --> 00:58:01,530
Oh, wowzers.

905
00:58:01,574 --> 00:58:05,101
That kiss just cost him
a lifetime of itchy sores,

906
00:58:05,144 --> 00:58:07,169
low self-esteem and crippling...

907
00:58:07,213 --> 00:58:09,647
Is that all true?

908
00:58:09,682 --> 00:58:11,673
Yeah.

909
00:58:15,922 --> 00:58:19,119
Hey, you.

910
00:58:20,593 --> 00:58:22,584
Yes?

911
00:58:24,130 --> 00:58:26,530
I was thinking...
I was thinking

912
00:58:26,566 --> 00:58:29,228
maybe we should
go for a walk.

913
00:58:29,268 --> 00:58:30,565
Right now?

914
00:58:32,438 --> 00:58:34,030
What about the kids?

915
00:58:34,073 --> 00:58:37,907
The kids... they're just as happy
as pot pies watching that video.

916
00:58:37,944 --> 00:58:40,071
And we, just the two of us,

917
00:58:40,112 --> 00:58:42,103
we're just sitting back here,

918
00:58:42,148 --> 00:58:44,343
yapping and talking,

919
00:58:44,383 --> 00:58:46,943
talking and yapping.

920
00:58:46,986 --> 00:58:49,614
So I was just thinking, you know,
maybe we...

921
00:58:49,655 --> 00:58:51,714
maybe a stroll would do us good.

922
00:58:54,594 --> 00:58:56,323
Okay.

923
00:58:56,362 --> 00:58:57,829
Yeah?

924
00:58:57,864 --> 00:59:00,230
-Sure, yeah.
-Yeah.

925
00:59:00,266 --> 00:59:03,030
But we gotta make it quick,
'cause last time I left the kids

926
00:59:03,069 --> 00:59:05,629
they made a Slip-N-Slide
out of KY and dental dams.

927
00:59:05,671 --> 00:59:07,696
Okay, yeah.
No, we'll be quick.

928
00:59:15,481 --> 00:59:18,279
It's Harper. Leave a message.

929
00:59:18,317 --> 00:59:22,276
421-555-6231.

930
00:59:22,321 --> 00:59:25,085
That is my number.
Stop being a dick.

931
00:59:27,526 --> 00:59:31,053
Sagosky, have the special-ed kids
form a perimeter.

932
00:59:38,204 --> 00:59:40,570
Where's that piece-of-ass inspector?

933
01:00:09,101 --> 01:00:10,830
Easy does it there.

934
01:00:12,338 --> 01:00:15,865
Easy does it like Miss Muffet
on her fat little tuffet.

935
01:00:39,932 --> 01:00:43,698
I never meant to have sex
with that dolphin trainer.

936
01:00:43,736 --> 01:00:46,330
You're a liar, but I forgive you.

937
01:00:46,372 --> 01:00:49,000
Come here, Big Daddy.

938
01:00:49,041 --> 01:00:51,874
Wrong again, Quincy.

939
01:00:54,146 --> 01:00:56,376
Who the hell are you supposed to be?

940
01:01:06,058 --> 01:01:08,618
Somebody here knows where
Vice Principal Willoman is,

941
01:01:08,661 --> 01:01:10,424
and if that somebody
doesn't speak up,

942
01:01:10,463 --> 01:01:12,522
that somebody is gonna be squealing
louder than a pig

943
01:01:12,565 --> 01:01:14,829
that's not only had
its throat sliced

944
01:01:14,867 --> 01:01:17,700
but also had both its balls
tucked up its ass

945
01:01:17,737 --> 01:01:20,069
before they were cut off first.
And let me tell you,

946
01:01:20,106 --> 01:01:22,700
if you're curious how painful that is,
listen up...

947
01:01:22,742 --> 01:01:24,733
very!

948
01:01:24,777 --> 01:01:27,337
I'm gonna count to one.
One.

949
01:01:34,253 --> 01:01:36,084
Holy shit.

950
01:01:37,857 --> 01:01:40,121
Vice principal is
in the boys' bathroom.

951
01:01:40,159 --> 01:01:41,683
He wants to touch
my chub-chub.

952
01:01:50,536 --> 01:01:54,404
What the hell is that bullshit?

953
01:01:54,440 --> 01:01:56,931
Get back to work.

954
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:08,442
Agh! This is fucking impossible!

955
01:02:08,487 --> 01:02:09,852
Damn it.

956
01:02:09,889 --> 01:02:14,121
It's trying on everyone.
Hold on, Tommy.

957
01:02:15,127 --> 01:02:17,118
Okay, here we go.

958
01:02:17,163 --> 01:02:19,597
Keep going, keep going.
Don't peek.

959
01:02:19,632 --> 01:02:21,623
Okay, don't look.

960
01:02:21,667 --> 01:02:23,760
Okay? Okay?

961
01:02:28,207 --> 01:02:30,402
Okay, we're here.

962
01:02:30,443 --> 01:02:33,207
Oh, it's your classroom.

963
01:02:33,245 --> 01:02:35,236
Yeah.

964
01:02:35,281 --> 01:02:37,272
I just thought we could...

965
01:02:37,316 --> 01:02:39,307
you know, or whatever,

966
01:02:39,351 --> 01:02:41,376
just, you know...

967
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:43,911
just connect or something,

968
01:02:43,956 --> 01:02:46,322
just talk,
whatever you want to do.

969
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:50,923
You really like turtles, huh?

970
01:02:50,963 --> 01:02:52,954
Yeah. That's Marzipan.

971
01:02:52,998 --> 01:02:56,456
And that one down there
is Halifax, yeah.

972
01:02:56,502 --> 01:02:58,766
Did you know that after
the dinosaurs died out

973
01:02:58,804 --> 01:03:00,271
there was an age of turtles?

974
01:03:00,306 --> 01:03:02,604
No, I didn't know that.

975
01:03:02,641 --> 01:03:04,609
I didn't think so.

976
01:03:04,643 --> 01:03:07,168
-This one here is ticklish.
-Really?

977
01:03:07,213 --> 01:03:09,204
Yeah. Watch this.

978
01:03:09,248 --> 01:03:12,081
Uh, I think you're hurting him.

979
01:03:12,118 --> 01:03:13,983
-No, he likes it.
-I don't think so.

980
01:03:14,019 --> 01:03:16,852
-Yeah, he does.
-Turner, stop.

981
01:03:18,023 --> 01:03:21,083
Okay, I think I'm gonna...
I'm gonna go.

982
01:03:21,127 --> 01:03:23,561
What? No no no, you can't go.

983
01:03:23,596 --> 01:03:25,587
I planned the whole afternoon.

984
01:03:25,631 --> 01:03:27,929
I-I-I have this for you.

985
01:03:27,967 --> 01:03:31,869
Bear with it
'cause it's not totally done, but...

986
01:03:33,339 --> 01:03:37,105
I didn't have a whole lot of time
during free period.

987
01:03:39,145 --> 01:03:41,136
"4 Ever or Never,"

988
01:03:41,180 --> 01:03:43,705
and then there's you and me

989
01:03:43,749 --> 01:03:46,183
and Halifax and Marzipan.

990
01:03:52,258 --> 01:03:54,021
And then there's that.

991
01:03:54,059 --> 01:03:57,790
Um, does that say sweatheart?

992
01:03:57,830 --> 01:04:00,162
No, it says sweetheart.

993
01:04:00,199 --> 01:04:02,190
I'm kinda sure is says sweatheart.

994
01:04:09,008 --> 01:04:10,407
Well, that's awkward.

995
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:14,577
I'm just gonna come out
and say it, okay?

996
01:04:14,613 --> 01:04:18,674
I have major fucking feelings
for you

997
01:04:18,717 --> 01:04:23,177
deep down in my loins,
in the places that matter.

998
01:04:23,222 --> 01:04:26,555
And I want to go there.
I want to take it there with you.

999
01:04:26,592 --> 01:04:28,651
I want to take it
to that next level

1000
01:04:28,694 --> 01:04:32,528
where we're feeling each other
and we're rubbing

1001
01:04:32,565 --> 01:04:36,023
and we explode.

1002
01:04:36,068 --> 01:04:39,697
So I don't know
if you feel the same way,

1003
01:04:39,738 --> 01:04:43,105
but I am fucking awesomely
in love with you, Gretchen.

1004
01:04:43,142 --> 01:04:46,703
Oh, no, Turner, you're not.

1005
01:04:46,745 --> 01:04:48,372
Yes, I am.

1006
01:04:48,414 --> 01:04:50,348
No, you're not.

1007
01:04:50,382 --> 01:04:54,045
Yeah, I don't think I would have
said all those things if I wasn't, okay?

1008
01:04:54,086 --> 01:04:55,747
I'm pretty sure I am.

1009
01:04:55,788 --> 01:04:58,256
I'm pretty sure you're not.

1010
01:04:58,290 --> 01:05:02,021
I don't know
how more clear I can be. I am.

1011
01:05:03,062 --> 01:05:06,031
You are sweet,

1012
01:05:06,065 --> 01:05:08,932
but I gotta get back to class now.

1013
01:05:08,968 --> 01:05:11,061
Okay?

1014
01:05:21,513 --> 01:05:23,879
I should have put
more hearts on it.

1015
01:05:23,916 --> 01:05:25,975
That was so stupid.

1016
01:05:28,854 --> 01:05:31,618
Billings has to be stopped, Tom.

1017
01:05:31,657 --> 01:05:34,649
-Stopped.
-Worse than we thought.

1018
01:05:34,693 --> 01:05:37,321
What is this?

1019
01:05:38,831 --> 01:05:41,163
-The balance sheet?
-Yeah, for the district.

1020
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:43,668
-The district balance sheet.
-Notice the total budget,

1021
01:05:43,702 --> 01:05:46,398
-then notice how much each school gets.
-There.

1022
01:05:46,438 --> 01:05:48,702
The numbers don't add up.

1023
01:05:48,741 --> 01:05:51,437
And guess which school
isn't even included in the total?

1024
01:05:51,477 --> 01:05:54,071
Take a fucking guess.
Take it. Shoot.

1025
01:05:54,113 --> 01:05:56,741
Ours.
But I don't get it.

1026
01:05:56,782 --> 01:05:59,250
The total is millions more
than the sum of all the schools' budgets.

1027
01:05:59,285 --> 01:06:01,014
Millions more than the sum.

1028
01:06:01,053 --> 01:06:04,045
And that difference is the exact budget
of Geraldine Ferraro.

1029
01:06:04,089 --> 01:06:05,522
This motherfucker!

1030
01:06:05,557 --> 01:06:07,184
-Can you stop?
-Yes.

1031
01:06:07,226 --> 01:06:09,194
Someone in the district goofed.

1032
01:06:09,228 --> 01:06:11,594
And Billings saw that we have
no paper trail.

1033
01:06:11,630 --> 01:06:14,360
-The money is just waiting to be plucked.
-Plucked like fruit.

1034
01:06:14,400 --> 01:06:17,961
So the school gets closed;
nobody knows the money is missing.

1035
01:06:18,003 --> 01:06:21,166
Close the doors,
and Principal Hershey Squirts

1036
01:06:21,206 --> 01:06:23,868
stuffs the moolah
in his fanny pack.

1037
01:06:23,909 --> 01:06:26,434
-What are you doing?
-What the fuck are you doing?

1038
01:06:26,478 --> 01:06:29,970
I'm calling the local news.
We have to get the word out now.

1039
01:06:30,015 --> 01:06:32,040
Fucking smarter than you know.

1040
01:06:34,553 --> 01:06:38,455
Uh, relax.
They're just blanks.

1041
01:06:38,490 --> 01:06:40,481
Jesus!

1042
01:06:40,526 --> 01:06:43,051
-What the fuck?!
-Are you crazy?

1043
01:06:43,095 --> 01:06:47,156
I'm really fucking psyched.

1044
01:06:47,199 --> 01:06:50,635
-God.
-Holy shit.

1045
01:06:50,669 --> 01:06:52,933
The mailbox for...

1046
01:06:52,971 --> 01:06:55,735
-Harper Billings.
-is full.

1047
01:06:55,774 --> 01:06:58,106
No.

1048
01:06:58,143 --> 01:07:00,338
Oh, fuck.

1049
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:03,040
Hello?

1050
01:07:03,082 --> 01:07:05,243
Wonderful. Thank you.
Thank you.

1051
01:07:05,284 --> 01:07:07,081
Local news is on the way.

1052
01:07:07,119 --> 01:07:08,245
Yeah.

1053
01:07:08,287 --> 01:07:11,518
Wait, where's Rebecca?

1054
01:07:13,592 --> 01:07:15,617
We're all set, sir.

1055
01:07:21,333 --> 01:07:23,233
Oh, no.

1056
01:07:25,671 --> 01:07:28,367
Tom.

1057
01:07:28,407 --> 01:07:31,069
Tommy.

1058
01:07:31,110 --> 01:07:33,305
I know you can hear me, Tom.

1059
01:07:33,345 --> 01:07:37,372
It's useless to go on.
I'm just too strong.

1060
01:07:38,917 --> 01:07:41,249
I'm not a bad guy, Tom.

1061
01:07:41,286 --> 01:07:44,153
This is just a bad situation.

1062
01:07:44,189 --> 01:07:47,317
This isn't cowboys
versus the Indians.

1063
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:50,920
This is
cowboys versus cowboys.

1064
01:07:50,963 --> 01:07:53,124
No one wants that, Tom...

1065
01:07:53,165 --> 01:07:55,963
cowboys fighting cowboys.

1066
01:07:56,001 --> 01:07:58,299
It's un-American.

1067
01:07:58,337 --> 01:08:01,135
I've got the girl, Tom.

1068
01:08:03,075 --> 01:08:05,942
Turn yourself in.
Stop all this hullabaloo.

1069
01:08:05,978 --> 01:08:08,606
You fought a good fight.

1070
01:08:11,917 --> 01:08:15,148
Today's lunch is beef stroganoff
and creamed spinach.

1071
01:08:15,187 --> 01:08:17,747
Happy birthdays go out
to Carolina Brushhair

1072
01:08:17,790 --> 01:08:19,951
and Tom-Tom O'Leary.

1073
01:08:19,992 --> 01:08:21,653
Soccer's canceled today.

1074
01:08:26,231 --> 01:08:30,258
Don't you listen to him, Tom.
It's a trap.

1075
01:08:30,302 --> 01:08:34,363
Tommy, we'll storm
the office, okay?

1076
01:08:34,406 --> 01:08:37,842
They'll be totally defenseless,
like a bunch of 10-year-olds in there.

1077
01:08:37,876 --> 01:08:40,936
No, guys, Billings is right.

1078
01:08:40,979 --> 01:08:43,641
We can't win.
It's impossible.

1079
01:08:43,682 --> 01:08:46,207
Listen, remember
what you said to me

1080
01:08:46,251 --> 01:08:49,618
when I thought I'd never beat
that painful case of the clap?

1081
01:08:49,655 --> 01:08:51,748
Tommy, what did you
say to her, Tommy?

1082
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:54,224
-What did you say?
-I said...

1083
01:08:54,259 --> 01:08:56,420
I said, "Nothing's impossible."

1084
01:08:56,462 --> 01:08:58,657
You said, "Nothing's

1085
01:08:58,697 --> 01:09:02,633
im-fucking-possible," man.

1086
01:09:05,204 --> 01:09:06,671
Nothing is impossible.

1087
01:09:11,210 --> 01:09:15,078
I am just a simple man. I just want
to sell delicious ice creams to you.

1088
01:09:15,113 --> 01:09:18,378
Shut up, you!
I got some demands!

1089
01:09:18,417 --> 01:09:22,183
I want a picture of Walter Cronkite
in a boat

1090
01:09:22,221 --> 01:09:24,121
where he's kind of still,

1091
01:09:24,156 --> 01:09:28,456
and $10,000
in Indian-Head nickels

1092
01:09:28,494 --> 01:09:31,657
in non-sequential
unmarked baggies!

1093
01:09:31,697 --> 01:09:33,892
I want to be part of
"The Family Ties."

1094
01:09:33,932 --> 01:09:35,991
What are you gonna do, Daddy?

1095
01:09:36,034 --> 01:09:37,729
I'm gonna save that man, son.

1096
01:09:37,769 --> 01:09:41,330
And I'm gonna live with Mallory
and we're gonna get bunk beds.

1097
01:09:41,373 --> 01:09:44,035
-That's impossible.
-I'm gonna kill this guy!

1098
01:09:44,076 --> 01:09:46,476
Let the man go, son.

1099
01:09:46,512 --> 01:09:49,811
I have pizza and a 747

1100
01:09:49,848 --> 01:09:52,339
on stand-by
with your name on it.

1101
01:09:52,384 --> 01:09:54,682
Yeah.

1102
01:09:54,720 --> 01:09:56,881
Yeah, okay.
That sounds good.

1103
01:10:00,025 --> 01:10:01,253
You lied to me!

1104
01:10:01,293 --> 01:10:03,523
-See, Tommy?
-What the fuck?

1105
01:10:03,562 --> 01:10:05,553
Nothing is impossible.

1106
01:10:24,249 --> 01:10:26,274
I got some demands!

1107
01:10:26,318 --> 01:10:28,309
I want a magical elf

1108
01:10:28,353 --> 01:10:30,844
and I want a special bag
to put him in,

1109
01:10:30,889 --> 01:10:33,153
so he can't use
his black magic on me.

1110
01:10:33,191 --> 01:10:35,682
This is like the déjà vu.

1111
01:10:35,727 --> 01:10:37,388
No, please don't kill me.

1112
01:10:37,429 --> 01:10:39,693
This is impossible.
-Nothing's impossible.

1113
01:10:39,731 --> 01:10:41,756
I saw that Dennis Quaid movie
"Dragonheart."

1114
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:44,860
-No, nothing's impossible.
-If dragons are real, I want one now.

1115
01:10:44,903 --> 01:10:47,371
And its fire-breathing mouth
is gonna burn all your shit.

1116
01:10:47,406 --> 01:10:50,273
-Nothing's impossible.
-Now if dragons are real,

1117
01:10:50,309 --> 01:10:52,300
I want a Komodo dragon.

1118
01:10:52,344 --> 01:10:54,812
And I'm gonna ride on its back
out of here.

1119
01:10:54,846 --> 01:10:57,838
I want to get one of the Olsen twins
down here

1120
01:10:57,883 --> 01:11:01,114
and I want a ring.
And I'm gonna make her my bride.

1121
01:11:01,153 --> 01:11:04,350
Which twin?
The good-dressed one

1122
01:11:04,389 --> 01:11:07,415
or the funky-vintage-cool,
hip chick?

1123
01:11:07,459 --> 01:11:10,053
I know you.
You were a child.

1124
01:11:10,095 --> 01:11:13,326
Your father... he's a hero.

1125
01:11:13,365 --> 01:11:15,265
I am safe!

1126
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:18,633
I have a...

1127
01:11:19,671 --> 01:11:21,798
I have a bean-and-cheese burrito

1128
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:23,603
and a Greyhound bus.

1129
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:27,310
Yeah? Horseshit.

1130
01:11:30,782 --> 01:11:32,909
No.

1131
01:11:32,951 --> 01:11:37,012
No! No!

1132
01:11:42,894 --> 01:11:45,260
Those were just words, guys.

1133
01:11:45,297 --> 01:11:48,130
Everything I've ever done
has ended in failure.

1134
01:11:48,166 --> 01:11:53,126
I don't know why I thought
this would be any different.

1135
01:11:53,171 --> 01:11:55,162
I'm sorry.

1136
01:12:04,883 --> 01:12:06,817
Oh, hey hey hey.

1137
01:12:11,156 --> 01:12:15,024
What? I'm a little nervous.
This helps me relax.

1138
01:12:15,060 --> 01:12:17,119
What, is this Gitmo or something?

1139
01:12:17,162 --> 01:12:20,063
Are you gonna waterboard me?

1140
01:12:25,504 --> 01:12:27,495
72 seconds.

1141
01:12:31,576 --> 01:12:34,943
I gave you the benefit of the doubt,
don't know why.

1142
01:12:34,980 --> 01:12:38,677
All right, Billings, you win.

1143
01:12:38,717 --> 01:12:40,708
What?

1144
01:12:40,752 --> 01:12:42,413
What, is that the best
you can do, Tom?

1145
01:12:42,454 --> 01:12:45,651
Just give me the girl
and we'll walk away.

1146
01:12:45,691 --> 01:12:47,591
You're born and bred
for this kind of situation.

1147
01:12:47,626 --> 01:12:50,857
The least you could do is offer me
a burrito and a bus ticket.

1148
01:12:50,896 --> 01:12:52,261
Oh.

1149
01:12:54,199 --> 01:12:56,690
You've been a bad boy, Tommy.

1150
01:12:56,735 --> 01:12:59,329
You know what happens
to bad boys.

1151
01:13:01,206 --> 01:13:02,332
They get detention.

1152
01:13:02,374 --> 01:13:05,002
They get detent...

1153
01:13:05,043 --> 01:13:08,706
-They get detention.
-They get detention.

1154
01:13:08,747 --> 01:13:11,477
They get detention.

1155
01:13:11,516 --> 01:13:13,381
They get
detention.

1156
01:13:13,418 --> 01:13:17,411
Okay, we get it.
Thank you both.

1157
01:13:17,456 --> 01:13:18,980
Okay.

1158
01:13:19,024 --> 01:13:21,515
They get detention.

1159
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:23,050
Don't say that again.

1160
01:13:23,095 --> 01:13:25,620
-They get detention.
-He's right, they get detention.

1161
01:13:25,664 --> 01:13:27,529
They get detention.

1162
01:13:27,566 --> 01:13:29,864
Shut up! Shut up!

1163
01:13:29,901 --> 01:13:31,528
Shut your fat mouth!

1164
01:13:32,838 --> 01:13:34,806
They get detention.

1165
01:13:44,683 --> 01:13:47,652
You guys won't get away with this!

1166
01:13:47,686 --> 01:13:50,246
-We already did, Tommy.
-Yeah, we already did, Tommy.

1167
01:13:52,791 --> 01:13:55,453
Hey, how long till more coconuts?

1168
01:14:00,198 --> 01:14:02,189
Thank you.

1169
01:14:07,038 --> 01:14:09,131
Can I sit here?

1170
01:14:09,174 --> 01:14:11,199
Sure.

1171
01:14:15,180 --> 01:14:18,308
Beef stroganoff looks good.

1172
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:19,977
Ugh.

1173
01:14:20,018 --> 01:14:22,816
Frankie, this is ridiculous.
Come back to me.

1174
01:14:22,854 --> 01:14:25,721
Come on home to mama.
My nights are so lonely.

1175
01:14:25,757 --> 01:14:27,588
Maybe you should have
thought of that

1176
01:14:27,626 --> 01:14:29,890
before you went poking around
in Bartlett's pup tent.

1177
01:14:29,928 --> 01:14:31,987
It was only numbers, Frankie.

1178
01:14:32,030 --> 01:14:34,294
You still love me?

1179
01:14:34,332 --> 01:14:36,300
That's the thing, Carlotta,

1180
01:14:36,334 --> 01:14:40,270
I still love you as much
as I've ever loved an eight-year-old.

1181
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:44,240
I'm in for a life of hurt with you,

1182
01:14:44,276 --> 01:14:46,870
I just know it,

1183
01:14:46,912 --> 01:14:48,641
but that's a hurt I need

1184
01:14:48,680 --> 01:14:53,014
like a cowboy craves coffee
and sunsets.

1185
01:14:58,123 --> 01:15:00,489
Sorry, kids, not red balls today.

1186
01:15:03,328 --> 01:15:06,092
Do you really still have
that click in your knees?

1187
01:15:12,370 --> 01:15:15,100
You know,
I don't understand, Tom.

1188
01:15:15,140 --> 01:15:18,132
Vice principal
of an elementary school?

1189
01:15:18,176 --> 01:15:20,940
You always wanted to follow
in your dad's footsteps.

1190
01:15:20,979 --> 01:15:24,847
I did.
I did follow him.

1191
01:15:24,883 --> 01:15:26,942
And a man is dead because of it.

1192
01:15:26,985 --> 01:15:29,715
He's not dead.
The bullet grazed his scalp. He's fine.

1193
01:15:29,754 --> 01:15:31,745
Well, he's dead to me.

1194
01:15:31,790 --> 01:15:33,553
Well, no one ever blamed you for it.

1195
01:15:33,592 --> 01:15:35,958
You're the only one
that cares anymore.

1196
01:15:35,994 --> 01:15:40,829
I'm a failed hostage negotiator
that just got kidnapped twice.

1197
01:15:40,866 --> 01:15:43,300
I'm washed up, Rebecca.

1198
01:15:43,335 --> 01:15:45,428
I've been washed up
my whole life.

1199
01:15:54,446 --> 01:15:56,505
Well, that's not how I see it.

1200
01:15:56,548 --> 01:15:59,346
I see you as this huge success.

1201
01:15:59,384 --> 01:16:01,716
You know I always wanted
to be a principal,

1202
01:16:01,753 --> 01:16:04,221
vice or otherwise?

1203
01:16:04,256 --> 01:16:06,247
No, I didn't know that.

1204
01:16:06,291 --> 01:16:09,283
It's true.
So you should be proud of yourself.

1205
01:16:09,327 --> 01:16:13,627
You're a good man
when you're not acting like a total pussy.

1206
01:16:15,934 --> 01:16:20,268
You know, I had the biggest
crush on you in high school.

1207
01:16:21,740 --> 01:16:24,709
Why didn't you ever say anything?

1208
01:16:24,743 --> 01:16:26,938
Why didn't you?

1209
01:16:28,947 --> 01:16:31,882
Did you just inhale
spray-paint fumes?

1210
01:16:31,917 --> 01:16:34,442
Yeah.

1211
01:16:36,488 --> 01:16:39,150
Rebecca, why?

1212
01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:43,251
I guess I'm running away
from my own failures,

1213
01:16:43,295 --> 01:16:45,559
from myself.

1214
01:16:45,597 --> 01:16:50,000
Well, maybe you should start
running towards something

1215
01:16:50,035 --> 01:16:52,765
for a change.

1216
01:16:52,804 --> 01:16:55,295
What, is this The Hague?

1217
01:16:55,340 --> 01:16:57,638
Is this some sort of

1218
01:16:57,676 --> 01:17:03,808
international tribunal court?

1219
01:17:04,849 --> 01:17:07,181
Is this The Hague?

1220
01:17:07,218 --> 01:17:09,618
The school's totally
gonna get shut down.

1221
01:17:09,654 --> 01:17:13,090
Billings will give you $3
if you join his side.

1222
01:17:13,124 --> 01:17:15,388
They're passing out
pitchforks and napalm.

1223
01:17:15,427 --> 01:17:18,021
There's some sort of dirty bomb
in the teachers' lounge.

1224
01:17:18,063 --> 01:17:20,896
The principal's gonna put us
on lockdown.

1225
01:17:20,932 --> 01:17:24,834
My father's gonna go crazy
if I get killed or maimed.

1226
01:17:24,869 --> 01:17:28,168
This is so stupid.
Where's the goddamn locksmith?

1227
01:17:29,874 --> 01:17:31,865
"Save Tom.

1228
01:17:31,910 --> 01:17:34,174
I need you to be the man."
Why don't you be the man?

1229
01:17:34,212 --> 01:17:35,873
Fuck this noise!

1230
01:17:39,818 --> 01:17:42,048
Come on, Jesse,
you don't fool me.

1231
01:17:42,087 --> 01:17:43,748
I know those things
are just blanks.

1232
01:17:43,788 --> 01:17:45,449
Remember we used to
scare the shit

1233
01:17:45,490 --> 01:17:47,924
out of the kid with a leaky bladder
with that thing?

1234
01:17:49,761 --> 01:17:51,956
Oh, you are gonna shoot me?

1235
01:17:51,997 --> 01:17:53,988
You're gonna shoot me?

1236
01:17:54,032 --> 01:17:57,092
What, are you gonna blow me away?
You're gonna waste me?

1237
01:17:57,135 --> 01:17:59,000
Okay, come on.

1238
01:17:59,037 --> 01:18:01,005
Put it right here, asshole.

1239
01:18:01,039 --> 01:18:03,940
A real man could shoot this shit.
You can't.

1240
01:18:06,444 --> 01:18:09,174
Oh, shit. Jesse.

1241
01:18:16,721 --> 01:18:20,179
Oh, God.
What the fuck, man?

1242
01:18:20,225 --> 01:18:22,022
You shot me!

1243
01:18:22,060 --> 01:18:24,620
Dude, it's just rock salt.

1244
01:18:24,662 --> 01:18:27,153
How bad is it? How bad is it?

1245
01:18:27,198 --> 01:18:30,065
Bro, come on. Minor surgery...
you're good as new.

1246
01:18:30,101 --> 01:18:31,966
It's a total outpatient thing.

1247
01:18:47,285 --> 01:18:49,753
Give me one.
Give me one.

1248
01:18:53,591 --> 01:18:56,822
Hello. Hey.

1249
01:18:56,861 --> 01:18:59,227
Nothing to see here, guys.

1250
01:19:00,865 --> 01:19:05,131
Just a non-event, seriously,

1251
01:19:05,170 --> 01:19:07,695
a non-event.

1252
01:19:07,739 --> 01:19:10,003
You guys can just
be on your way

1253
01:19:10,041 --> 01:19:13,306
and we'll be good to go,

1254
01:19:13,344 --> 01:19:16,108
unless you want to grab
some pizza or something,

1255
01:19:16,147 --> 01:19:18,308
go bowling.

1256
01:19:19,884 --> 01:19:22,284
Yeah, get out of here.

1257
01:19:22,320 --> 01:19:24,345
You've got stuff to do.

1258
01:19:26,624 --> 01:19:29,184
Bingo.

1259
01:19:32,797 --> 01:19:34,594
Hey, Jesse.

1260
01:19:35,633 --> 01:19:37,658
A man has been shot.

1261
01:19:43,141 --> 01:19:45,336
Sir, we're losing men out there.

1262
01:19:48,947 --> 01:19:50,972
-Sound it.
-Sound the alarm.

1263
01:19:51,015 --> 01:19:54,178
Sound the alarm. Sound the alarm.

1264
01:19:58,556 --> 01:20:01,457
No. No no no no,
the news vans haven't gotten here yet.

1265
01:20:01,493 --> 01:20:03,518
Come on, come on, come on.

1266
01:20:06,164 --> 01:20:08,632
That's lockdown, people.

1267
01:20:12,804 --> 01:20:15,534
Three more hours
to wait these assholes out.

1268
01:20:16,875 --> 01:20:19,708
We'll never get out alive!

1269
01:20:39,597 --> 01:20:42,532
You guys are over there
and we're over here.

1270
01:20:47,739 --> 01:20:49,434
Quiet!

1271
01:20:59,684 --> 01:21:02,346
So this is what it's come to, huh?

1272
01:21:03,788 --> 01:21:05,949
Look at you all.

1273
01:21:05,990 --> 01:21:09,448
You traitors.
You freaks.

1274
01:21:10,495 --> 01:21:14,556
I built this school
with my own hands.

1275
01:21:16,100 --> 01:21:20,230
I pounded nails like Jesus.

1276
01:21:20,271 --> 01:21:22,466
I built stairways for our youth

1277
01:21:22,507 --> 01:21:25,067
to vibrant and rewarding lives.

1278
01:21:25,109 --> 01:21:26,872
And this is how you repay me?

1279
01:21:26,911 --> 01:21:30,472
You're welcome.
You're welcome.

1280
01:21:30,515 --> 01:21:33,245
Now let's stop this donnybrook
before it can start.

1281
01:21:33,284 --> 01:21:36,048
Lay down your weapons,
join me

1282
01:21:36,087 --> 01:21:38,453
and we can all break bread
as men,

1283
01:21:38,489 --> 01:21:41,287
or suffer wrath at my hands.

1284
01:21:46,030 --> 01:21:48,055
My flute!

1285
01:21:48,099 --> 01:21:50,090
My flute!

1286
01:21:50,134 --> 01:21:52,967
Stupid.

1287
01:21:55,440 --> 01:21:57,965
You broke that kid's flute.

1288
01:22:01,045 --> 01:22:03,605
That kid could play the hell
out of the flute.

1289
01:22:04,616 --> 01:22:06,641
What the fuck is wrong with you?

1290
01:22:06,684 --> 01:22:08,811
Asshole.

1291
01:22:10,054 --> 01:22:13,182
Everybody, Billings is right.

1292
01:22:13,224 --> 01:22:17,285
Let's stop this
before it starts, okay?

1293
01:22:17,328 --> 01:22:20,161
But I want to tell
all of you teachers a story first.

1294
01:22:21,599 --> 01:22:25,091
This morning a little girl came to me
with gravy all over her head.

1295
01:22:26,371 --> 01:22:28,430
Hey there, Adelle.

1296
01:22:28,473 --> 01:22:31,670
She came to me for help.
And you know what?

1297
01:22:31,709 --> 01:22:33,973
I saw her as a burden.

1298
01:22:34,012 --> 01:22:35,673
Yeah.

1299
01:22:35,713 --> 01:22:38,341
And that sort of thing
is happening too much around here,

1300
01:22:38,383 --> 01:22:40,749
from me, from the rest of you,

1301
01:22:40,785 --> 01:22:44,346
and yes, from our principal.

1302
01:22:44,389 --> 01:22:46,755
Have we forgotten about
our school namesake,

1303
01:22:46,791 --> 01:22:49,521
Miss Geraldine Ferraro,

1304
01:22:49,560 --> 01:22:54,623
one-time female
vice-presidential candidate

1305
01:22:54,666 --> 01:22:56,657
for America?

1306
01:22:56,701 --> 01:22:58,692
There's a lesson there, I think.

1307
01:22:58,736 --> 01:23:02,137
Too many of us have forgotten
why we got into teaching in the first place.

1308
01:23:02,173 --> 01:23:04,334
Too many of us are focused
on our pensions and our tenures

1309
01:23:04,375 --> 01:23:07,310
instead of the most important thing...

1310
01:23:07,345 --> 01:23:09,836
the kids.

1311
01:23:09,881 --> 01:23:12,475
Don't we want to fight
for anything anymore?

1312
01:23:12,517 --> 01:23:15,042
Are we just gonna
sit back and watch

1313
01:23:15,086 --> 01:23:19,113
while other people use fear
and money as a weapon?

1314
01:23:19,157 --> 01:23:23,287
I say we stand up for the most
important weapon there is...

1315
01:23:24,829 --> 01:23:26,820
knowledge.

1316
01:23:26,864 --> 01:23:29,230
Knowledge?

1317
01:23:29,267 --> 01:23:32,600
How is knowledge
better than fear and money?

1318
01:23:32,637 --> 01:23:34,537
Knowledge is power!

1319
01:23:34,572 --> 01:23:37,166
Oh, really, little boy?
Well, what if I took a gun

1320
01:23:37,208 --> 01:23:39,267
and I shot your dad in the face?

1321
01:23:39,310 --> 01:23:41,540
Hmm? Where's the power then?

1322
01:23:41,579 --> 01:23:43,672
Is the quadratic equation
gonna save him?

1323
01:23:43,715 --> 01:23:45,842
No no, I doubt it,

1324
01:23:45,883 --> 01:23:47,874
because you know what?

1325
01:23:47,919 --> 01:23:49,750
His brains are splattered
all over your mom,

1326
01:23:49,787 --> 01:23:52,688
who... guess what... I could
also shoot if I wanted to.

1327
01:23:52,724 --> 01:23:54,919
You can all do your peacenik
beret-wearing,

1328
01:23:54,959 --> 01:23:56,688
hippie bullshit dance if you want,

1329
01:23:56,728 --> 01:23:59,288
but soon you're gonna realize
how the real world works.

1330
01:23:59,330 --> 01:24:02,094
Hey! Get back here!

1331
01:24:02,133 --> 01:24:04,124
Get back here!

1332
01:24:04,168 --> 01:24:06,898
Don't slide away from me.

1333
01:24:06,938 --> 01:24:09,463
Hey, let's rally.
Let's rally, huh?

1334
01:24:09,507 --> 01:24:13,739
Buddy up, come on.
Buddy up.

1335
01:24:15,680 --> 01:24:17,045
Melody.

1336
01:24:17,081 --> 01:24:19,447
You never supported us, Harper.

1337
01:24:20,785 --> 01:24:23,117
And you squashed my dreams.

1338
01:24:23,154 --> 01:24:24,917
I wanted to be a novelist.

1339
01:24:25,957 --> 01:24:28,448
Oh.

1340
01:24:28,493 --> 01:24:31,189
Oh, well, that's a novel idea.

1341
01:24:31,229 --> 01:24:34,198
Why don't you sell some novelties
while you're at it?

1342
01:24:39,103 --> 01:24:41,401
That's not mine.

1343
01:24:43,107 --> 01:24:47,134
Look, I don't agree with anything
that asshole was saying,

1344
01:24:47,178 --> 01:24:49,806
but it seems kind of gay
if it's just the two of us.

1345
01:24:51,315 --> 01:24:53,306
I gotta go.

1346
01:25:07,732 --> 01:25:10,428
You suck, Billings.

1347
01:25:22,013 --> 01:25:26,074
So now what?
The school's still gonna get shut down.

1348
01:25:26,117 --> 01:25:29,450
What in God's name
is going on here?

1349
01:25:29,487 --> 01:25:31,182
Chairman Parpadelle.

1350
01:25:31,222 --> 01:25:32,951
Chairwoman, thank you.

1351
01:25:32,990 --> 01:25:36,118
Why is everyone standing around?

1352
01:25:36,160 --> 01:25:37,354
Thank God you're here.

1353
01:25:37,395 --> 01:25:40,330
Principal Billings has been
stealing money from this school.

1354
01:25:40,364 --> 01:25:42,832
Stealing? Really?

1355
01:25:42,867 --> 01:25:44,835
And where is Principal Billings?

1356
01:25:44,869 --> 01:25:46,666
He went to his office.

1357
01:25:46,704 --> 01:25:48,672
Like a whiny little bitch!

1358
01:25:48,706 --> 01:25:51,698
-Okay.
-Oh...

1359
01:25:51,742 --> 01:25:54,506
Look, Mrs. Parpadelle,

1360
01:25:54,545 --> 01:25:58,174
ma'am, we know you want
to close our school,

1361
01:25:58,216 --> 01:26:01,413
but we have shown more spirit
in the last few hours

1362
01:26:01,452 --> 01:26:03,443
than we have in the last
few years.

1363
01:26:03,488 --> 01:26:05,956
Spirit and a dollar
will get you

1364
01:26:05,990 --> 01:26:07,958
a diet Sprite and a smile, son.

1365
01:26:07,992 --> 01:26:10,119
I've heard what you've said.

1366
01:26:10,161 --> 01:26:12,823
I'll speak to Principal Billings.

1367
01:26:21,005 --> 01:26:22,996
Something isn't right.

1368
01:26:23,040 --> 01:26:25,668
I can feel it.

1369
01:26:25,710 --> 01:26:28,042
Vice Principal,

1370
01:26:28,079 --> 01:26:30,070
I know someone who can help.

1371
01:26:37,722 --> 01:26:40,486
The past is the past, Bartlett.

1372
01:26:40,525 --> 01:26:42,755
We don't need to put it behind us.

1373
01:26:42,793 --> 01:26:45,318
It's already there.

1374
01:27:01,546 --> 01:27:03,207
Go go go.

1375
01:27:03,247 --> 01:27:06,148
Okay,

1376
01:27:06,183 --> 01:27:07,548
out of my way.

1377
01:27:07,585 --> 01:27:10,520
Would you please just step to the...?

1378
01:27:10,555 --> 01:27:12,420
Out of my way!

1379
01:27:14,692 --> 01:27:16,717
Who the hell are you guys?

1380
01:27:22,733 --> 01:27:24,257
I don't understand that move.

1381
01:27:24,302 --> 01:27:27,567
Aren't you guys on the same team?

1382
01:27:27,605 --> 01:27:29,937
All right, if you're gonna shock me

1383
01:27:29,974 --> 01:27:33,466
with the cattle prod, do it now.

1384
01:27:33,511 --> 01:27:36,912
If not, get out the goddamn way,
all right?

1385
01:27:44,522 --> 01:27:46,752
As of 3:00 this afternoon

1386
01:27:46,791 --> 01:27:50,124
Geraldine Ferraro Elementary will cease
to be part of the school district.

1387
01:27:50,161 --> 01:27:52,891
-What?
-That's final. Good day.

1388
01:27:52,930 --> 01:27:54,591
Wait wait wait,

1389
01:27:54,632 --> 01:27:56,998
you can't do that.

1390
01:27:57,034 --> 01:27:59,525
I just did.

1391
01:27:59,570 --> 01:28:03,631
This school will no longer be a cancer
on our fine county.

1392
01:28:03,674 --> 01:28:07,041
I'd watch what you say
when you leave here.

1393
01:28:07,078 --> 01:28:09,740
Slander's a serious crime, Tom.

1394
01:28:09,780 --> 01:28:12,180
You've already screwed up
one career.

1395
01:28:12,216 --> 01:28:14,684
Don't make a habit of it.

1396
01:28:15,853 --> 01:28:19,345
Forget about this dump.
Give it up. Go home.

1397
01:28:25,863 --> 01:28:28,627
-$30,000.
-$50,000,

1398
01:28:28,666 --> 01:28:31,635
Harper, dear.
In light of this here disaster

1399
01:28:31,669 --> 01:28:33,398
it's a bargain to get me
to be quiet.

1400
01:28:33,437 --> 01:28:35,462
Shut that off this instant.

1401
01:28:35,506 --> 01:28:37,667
-40 thou.
-45,

1402
01:28:37,708 --> 01:28:41,371
-and I get to see that big hog of yours.
-I'm on it.

1403
01:28:45,049 --> 01:28:47,609
Your hands
are so rough.

1404
01:28:47,652 --> 01:28:50,712
Okay, now let me see your vag.

1405
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:57,955
Fucking embarrassing.

1406
01:28:57,995 --> 01:28:59,986
It's gross.

1407
01:29:00,031 --> 01:29:02,556
We got a deal.

1408
01:29:02,600 --> 01:29:05,091
That's enough.

1409
01:29:05,136 --> 01:29:07,502
Yeah, it sure is.

1410
01:29:07,538 --> 01:29:10,439
You disgust me, Miss Parpadelle.

1411
01:29:10,474 --> 01:29:11,702
Me too.

1412
01:29:11,742 --> 01:29:15,838
But you should really get that checked out.
I mean, that sounds horrible.

1413
01:29:15,880 --> 01:29:19,873
That's no way to talk
to the chairwoman of the school board.

1414
01:29:19,917 --> 01:29:23,148
Oh, I don't think you are
in any position to tell us

1415
01:29:23,187 --> 01:29:25,951
what to do, Miss Parpadelle.

1416
01:29:25,990 --> 01:29:27,480
Here's what's gonna happen:

1417
01:29:27,525 --> 01:29:30,517
You're going back to the board.
You're gonna tell them

1418
01:29:30,561 --> 01:29:33,894
that we are headed
in the right direction

1419
01:29:33,931 --> 01:29:37,628
and as of tomorrow we will be
under new management.

1420
01:29:37,668 --> 01:29:40,034
You're in
way over your head, Tom.

1421
01:29:40,071 --> 01:29:42,335
-Shut up, Harper.
-Okay.

1422
01:29:43,908 --> 01:29:45,398
And the tape?

1423
01:29:45,443 --> 01:29:47,604
You do all that

1424
01:29:47,645 --> 01:29:49,272
and I'll destroy the tape.

1425
01:29:49,313 --> 01:29:51,110
I'll take the tape.

1426
01:29:53,384 --> 01:29:56,182
The failed negotiator
learns to negotiate.

1427
01:29:56,220 --> 01:29:57,551
Touching.

1428
01:29:57,588 --> 01:30:00,955
And I'm assuming
you'll want the principal job?

1429
01:30:00,991 --> 01:30:03,425
Actually, no,
not even if you doubled

1430
01:30:03,461 --> 01:30:06,658
my miserable excuse
for a salary.

1431
01:30:06,697 --> 01:30:09,165
No no, I think

1432
01:30:09,200 --> 01:30:10,929
we need someone
from the outside,

1433
01:30:10,968 --> 01:30:13,163
someone who is smart,
passionate,

1434
01:30:13,204 --> 01:30:15,195
and has just been waiting
for the chance

1435
01:30:15,239 --> 01:30:18,208
to stand up
and prove themselves,

1436
01:30:18,242 --> 01:30:20,972
someone like you,
Rebecca.

1437
01:30:21,011 --> 01:30:22,239
Me?

1438
01:30:24,115 --> 01:30:27,607
She's just some drug-addled...
agh! Agh!

1439
01:30:29,520 --> 01:30:30,919
Is that all?

1440
01:30:30,955 --> 01:30:33,480
And show us your vag.

1441
01:30:36,393 --> 01:30:38,588
Okay, maybe that's...
no, we don't need to do that at all.

1442
01:30:38,629 --> 01:30:40,153
And your butthole!

1443
01:30:40,197 --> 01:30:41,755
We don't need to see that either.

1444
01:30:41,799 --> 01:30:44,791
And your titties!

1445
01:30:44,835 --> 01:30:48,293
I'm so sorry.
I don't know what's happening.

1446
01:30:48,339 --> 01:30:50,432
We don't need to see any of that.
It's all inappropriate.

1447
01:30:50,474 --> 01:30:52,965
-We don't want to see...
-You have a deal, young man.

1448
01:30:53,010 --> 01:30:56,275
The school remains open.

1449
01:31:07,124 --> 01:31:09,649
Everybody shut up.

1450
01:31:10,661 --> 01:31:13,960
Good on you.

1451
01:31:13,998 --> 01:31:15,989
Are my eyes closed?

1452
01:31:17,168 --> 01:31:19,068
Are my eyes closed?

1453
01:31:59,109 --> 01:32:01,771
There are styrofoam peanuts in this.

1454
01:32:08,052 --> 01:32:10,452
Shit.

1455
01:32:12,189 --> 01:32:14,020
I think I'm ready for that beer now.

1456
01:32:15,092 --> 01:32:17,253
I think I'll buy it for you.

1457
01:32:17,294 --> 01:32:19,785
Come on, let's get out of here.

1458
01:32:24,101 --> 01:32:26,501
putting the handy
back in handicapped.

1459
01:32:26,537 --> 01:32:29,404
And breaking word on the story
we told you about this morning:

1460
01:32:29,440 --> 01:32:32,409
A scandal is unfolding
at Geraldine Ferraro Elementary

1461
01:32:32,443 --> 01:32:35,071
involving millions of dollars
of embezzled district money.

1462
01:32:35,112 --> 01:32:38,343
Police raided Principal Harper Billings's
condo late this afternoon.

1463
01:32:38,382 --> 01:32:40,282
Students and faculty
were victorious

1464
01:32:40,317 --> 01:32:42,046
in their fight to save the school
from closure

1465
01:32:42,086 --> 01:32:44,884
and they celebrated with a dance
in the school cafeteria.

1466
01:32:45,890 --> 01:32:48,518
-One...
-Two...

1467
01:32:48,559 --> 01:32:49,548
Three!

1468
01:32:55,432 --> 01:32:58,230
Hey.

1469
01:33:02,640 --> 01:33:05,370
You were really great out there, Frankie.

1470
01:33:05,409 --> 01:33:07,001
I know,

1471
01:33:07,044 --> 01:33:08,807
but that's how you separate a man

1472
01:33:08,846 --> 01:33:10,905
from a second-grader, right?

1473
01:33:10,948 --> 01:33:14,440
I have no idea, but it turns me on.

1474
01:33:14,485 --> 01:33:16,214
Say it slower, girl.

1475
01:33:30,801 --> 01:33:32,359
Hello, Nurse Gretchen.

1476
01:33:32,403 --> 01:33:34,633
Hi, Mr. Abernathy.

1477
01:33:34,672 --> 01:33:38,836
May I have this dance?

1478
01:33:39,843 --> 01:33:40,969
Sure.

1479
01:33:41,011 --> 01:33:43,070
Oh, shit. Fuck, yes.

1480
01:33:43,113 --> 01:33:45,581
Oh. Oh, fuck me, yes.

1481
01:33:45,616 --> 01:33:47,243
I thought you'd be totally

1482
01:33:47,284 --> 01:33:49,275
creeped out by me now, so I wasn't sure.

1483
01:33:49,320 --> 01:33:51,220
Yeah, well, Turner,

1484
01:33:51,255 --> 01:33:53,519
you are intense,

1485
01:33:53,557 --> 01:33:56,492
but you've got a lot of heart

1486
01:33:56,527 --> 01:33:58,654
and your students really love you.

1487
01:33:58,696 --> 01:34:00,288
I also love my turtles.

1488
01:34:00,331 --> 01:34:01,320
I know.

1489
01:34:01,365 --> 01:34:03,094
I love my turtles so much.

1490
01:34:03,133 --> 01:34:05,931
Okay, why don't we slow it up a bit,

1491
01:34:05,970 --> 01:34:08,029
take it one step at a time?

1492
01:34:08,072 --> 01:34:09,801
-Yeah.
-Okay.

1493
01:34:09,840 --> 01:34:12,570
Whew.

1494
01:34:12,609 --> 01:34:14,702
Um...

1495
01:34:17,081 --> 01:34:18,742
Oh. Okay.

1496
01:34:20,884 --> 01:34:22,715
There.

1497
01:34:31,628 --> 01:34:33,596
# I was once a young man,
smart and patient #

1498
01:34:33,630 --> 01:34:35,564
# Went to work,
took an average vacation #

1499
01:34:35,599 --> 01:34:39,194
# Now I'm into booze and procrastination
'cause I'm in education #

1500
01:34:39,236 --> 01:34:40,999
# Look at me now,
barely paying my rent #

1501
01:34:41,038 --> 01:34:42,869
# Got 100 grand in gambling debt #

1502
01:34:42,906 --> 01:34:44,669
# Got a bottle of Jack
stashed in my desk #

1503
01:34:44,708 --> 01:34:47,336
# Yes, I'm in education #

1504
01:34:47,378 --> 01:34:50,973
# I'm an educator, baby,
a teacher of young minds #

1505
01:34:51,015 --> 01:34:53,074
# We're gonna watch "Big Lebowski"
today, kids #

1506
01:34:53,117 --> 01:34:54,778
# Suzie, shut the blinds #

1507
01:34:54,818 --> 01:34:56,683
# I phone in my lesson plan #

1508
01:34:56,720 --> 01:34:58,551
# I take three months of vacation #

1509
01:34:58,589 --> 01:35:02,719
# Yeah, I'm in education #

1510
01:35:03,894 --> 01:35:06,328
# Well, I teach my kids
to avoid drugs #

1511
01:35:06,363 --> 01:35:07,955
# But I got a closet
full of nugs #

1512
01:35:07,998 --> 01:35:09,863
# Got arrested for giving
a young girls a hug #

1513
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:11,765
# Yep, I'm in education #

1514
01:35:11,802 --> 01:35:13,599
# Been divorced twice
for sleeping around #

1515
01:35:13,637 --> 01:35:15,332
# I'm wanted in two other towns #

1516
01:35:15,372 --> 01:35:17,272
# Just had sex
in the teachers' lounge #

1517
01:35:17,307 --> 01:35:19,798
# Yep, I'm in education #

1518
01:35:19,843 --> 01:35:23,210
# I'm an educator, baby,
a molder of young minds #

1519
01:35:23,247 --> 01:35:25,238
# I think we'll watch
"Three Amigos" #

1520
01:35:25,282 --> 01:35:27,307
# So, Suzie, shut the blinds #

1521
01:35:27,351 --> 01:35:29,148
# I'm completely underqualified #

1522
01:35:29,186 --> 01:35:31,017
# For this job I'm dead wrong #

1523
01:35:31,055 --> 01:35:33,023
# I phone in my lesson plan #

1524
01:35:33,057 --> 01:35:35,457
# And get drunk all summer long #

1525
01:35:35,492 --> 01:35:37,687
# Well, I organize field trips #

1526
01:35:37,728 --> 01:35:39,457
# To the beach #

1527
01:35:39,496 --> 01:35:43,262
# Sell kids cigarettes
for 25¢ each #

1528
01:35:43,300 --> 01:35:46,895
# They say, those who can't do well,
we teach #

1529
01:35:46,937 --> 01:35:50,236
# I said, yeah, I'm in education #

1530
01:35:50,274 --> 01:35:52,606
# Where every day I come in drunk #

1531
01:35:52,643 --> 01:35:54,508
# The kids' parents think
I'm a monk #

1532
01:35:54,545 --> 01:35:56,308
# If I took my own class
I'd probably flunk #

1533
01:35:56,346 --> 01:35:58,280
# Yep, I'm in education #

1534
01:35:58,315 --> 01:36:00,044
# Make 10 Gs a year,
I'm full of sorrow #

1535
01:36:00,084 --> 01:36:01,949
# My school's named after
Geraldine Ferraro #

1536
01:36:01,985 --> 01:36:03,816
# I know I owe you cash, kid,
I'll pay you tomorrow #

1537
01:36:03,854 --> 01:36:06,152
# I'm in education #

1538
01:36:06,190 --> 01:36:08,181
# I'm an educator, baby #

1539
01:36:08,225 --> 01:36:10,125
# A teacher of young minds #

1540
01:36:10,160 --> 01:36:12,025
# We're gonna watch
"Animal House," kids #

1541
01:36:12,062 --> 01:36:13,689
# Suzie, shut the blinds #

1542
01:36:13,730 --> 01:36:15,891
# I phone in my lesson plan #

1543
01:36:15,933 --> 01:36:17,867
# And get three months of vacation #

1544
01:36:17,901 --> 01:36:21,359
# Yeah, I'm in education #

1545
01:36:22,439 --> 01:36:25,067
# Well, our principal takes himself
chocolate baths #

1546
01:36:25,109 --> 01:36:26,974
# Let's blow off science
for some arts and crafts #

1547
01:36:27,010 --> 01:36:28,773
# Got a 9 on my SATs,
but I teach math #

1548
01:36:28,812 --> 01:36:30,803
# I'm in education #

1549
01:36:30,848 --> 01:36:34,181
# The day goes faster
when I'm on speed #

1550
01:36:34,218 --> 01:36:36,243
# 28, and I can barely read #

1551
01:36:36,286 --> 01:36:38,311
# But I'll give your kids
what they need #

1552
01:36:38,355 --> 01:36:40,915
# 'Cause I'm in education #

1553
01:36:40,958 --> 01:36:43,688
# Well, I'm off
to the teachers' lounge #

1554
01:36:43,727 --> 01:36:45,661
# For some masturbation #

1555
01:36:45,696 --> 01:36:50,656
# Yeah, I'm in education... #

1556
01:36:50,701 --> 01:36:55,536
E-D-U-K-A-S-H-U-N,
or something like that

1557
01:36:55,572 --> 01:36:57,699
How many years
till my tenure?

1558
01:36:57,741 --> 01:36:59,231
What?

1559
01:36:59,276 --> 01:37:00,766
God damn it.
