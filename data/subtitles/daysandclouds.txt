00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:01,793
This "Madonna and Child,"

3
00:01:01,861 --> 00:01:03,522
like the painting I just compared

4
00:01:03,596 --> 00:01:06,087
with the one from St. Bernard
and St. Lucilla,

5
00:01:06,166 --> 00:01:09,829
was in the main chapel
of San Donato al Ponte

6
00:01:09,903 --> 00:01:12,269
and until recently was attributed

7
00:01:12,338 --> 00:01:14,431
to Agnolo Salimbeni.

8
00:01:14,507 --> 00:01:17,704
But Miroslav Kostivitz's studies

9
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:21,838
published in 1974
in the third issue

10
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,383
of "The Burlington Magazine"

11
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:27,579
show that the artist from Arezzo had
nothing to do with this work.

12
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:30,214
I think it could actually be

13
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,350
Boniforte da Barga's work,

14
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:37,157
with whose paintings
this "Madonna and Child"

15
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:41,223
shows, in my opinion,
surprising affinities.

16
00:02:00,386 --> 00:02:04,322
Take for example
"Saint George and the Dragon,"

17
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,188
which critics attribute

18
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:09,125
to Boniforte.

19
00:02:09,195 --> 00:02:11,129
Notice the landscape,

20
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:14,598
the attitude in which
the figures are portrayed,

21
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:18,467
and, above all,
the princess's face.

22
00:02:18,538 --> 00:02:21,371
As you can see, her features

23
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:24,342
and those of the Madonna

24
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:27,345
resemble each other so much

25
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:29,278
that it's probable Boniforte

26
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:31,909
used the same model
for both works.

27
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:52,793
Certainly, during that time,
Boniforte was in contact

28
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:54,931
with the Annunziata
Convent prior,

29
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,737
as we can see
from a document

30
00:02:56,809 --> 00:02:59,744
dated March 13th, 1426,

31
00:02:59,812 --> 00:03:04,647
which orders
the payment of 200 genovini

32
00:03:04,717 --> 00:03:08,244
to Magister Boniforte da Barga,

33
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:09,845
painter.

34
00:03:09,923 --> 00:03:12,289
Without detailing
all the transformations

35
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,849
this historic building
has undergone,

36
00:03:14,928 --> 00:03:17,055
I wanted to show you the plans

37
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:19,257
of what remains today

38
00:03:19,332 --> 00:03:22,233
of the ancient convent's chapel.

39
00:03:22,302 --> 00:03:24,930
Right now, I'm collaborating

40
00:03:25,004 --> 00:03:26,266
on restorations

41
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:30,173
that have uncovered a fresco.

42
00:03:30,243 --> 00:03:33,371
If we're lucky, it might turn out

43
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:35,471
to be by Boniforte.

44
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:39,177
This is a truly exhaustive study

45
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:42,153
that the candidate
has carried out seriously,

46
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:45,851
courageously venturing
into the complex field

47
00:03:45,925 --> 00:03:48,018
of the attribution of artworks.

48
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:19,518
DAYS AND CLOUDS

49
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,355
Good girl.

50
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:27,090
I think they realized
what was going on.

51
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,259
Of course not! I didn't.

52
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:32,827
I was in total panic.
Luckily, I remembered a little detail...

53
00:04:32,905 --> 00:04:35,430
what are we doing here?

54
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,567
You always liked it.

55
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,874
Yes, of course, but...

56
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:42,710
It's always nice.

57
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:49,316
If I were 20, I wouldn't have
graduated with outstanding praise.

58
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:51,482
Stop going on about your age!
You were simply great.

59
00:04:51,557 --> 00:04:55,118
All right.

60
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:00,626
What's this?

61
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:03,863
We're going to Cambodia.
That's my gift.

62
00:05:03,936 --> 00:05:05,699
So what? Besides,

63
00:05:05,772 --> 00:05:08,297
I don't know if we'll
be able to fly on the 27th.

64
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:10,001
Isn't it already organized?

65
00:05:10,076 --> 00:05:13,204
There's a problem at work.

66
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:15,042
Anyway, we're going. Open it!

67
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:17,810
- What's the matter?
- Nothing, we're definitely going.

68
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:20,079
Come on, open it.
We're going.

69
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,483
- They're antique.
- They're lovely.

70
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,386
- Hold this.
- Beautiful, aren't they?

71
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:33,091
Fantastic! Look.

72
00:05:33,166 --> 00:05:34,690
You're beautiful, Professor.

73
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:37,167
Thank you.

74
00:05:37,236 --> 00:05:39,966
When do Nadia and Fabrizio
expect us?

75
00:05:40,039 --> 00:05:42,439
Around 9:00
at the restaurant.

76
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:44,567
I have to take these shoes off
and have a shower.

77
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,085
- I'm so proud of you!
- So that's why you disappeared.

78
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:05,961
- Hi, Jacopo.
- Congratulations!

79
00:06:06,032 --> 00:06:09,365
- Daddy, why did you invite Jacopo?
- He's a friend.

80
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:11,869
It's like a high school party.
That's great.

81
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,099
You're an accomplice too.

82
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:16,767
- I was the first one!
- You bowled the examiners over.

83
00:06:16,843 --> 00:06:19,573
- You always exaggerate.
- Come and change.

84
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,112
- See you later!
- Later.

85
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,741
# I was asking my mother
about you... #

86
00:06:26,452 --> 00:06:29,421
- You're here too!
- Could we have missed out?

87
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,013
Your favorite ex-coworkers.

88
00:06:31,090 --> 00:06:33,718
- You shouldn't have!
- Your sister from Hamburg...

89
00:06:33,793 --> 00:06:37,194
- she swore she was coming.
- Thanks, it's really beautiful.

90
00:06:37,263 --> 00:06:39,823
You're nuts!
Look what you've done.

91
00:06:39,899 --> 00:06:41,958
Dori!

92
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,895
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

93
00:06:46,973 --> 00:06:48,406
- Hi.
- Where were you?

94
00:06:48,474 --> 00:06:50,965
I got out late.
For your mom.

95
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,243
She's over there.

96
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:09,956
- Hello, Riki.
- Congratulations.

97
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:12,020
- Thanks.
- This is for you.

98
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,862
Thank you.

99
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,335
- Aren't you going to open it?
- Later, when it's quieter.

100
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:20,872
It's okay,
the battery's charged.

101
00:07:25,344 --> 00:07:29,610
#... The moon hanging
on the wall #

102
00:07:29,682 --> 00:07:32,776
# I get thirsty at night... #

103
00:07:32,852 --> 00:07:34,479
Now it's time.

104
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:38,615
# Let me drink, my love,
let me drink. #

105
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:40,886
Will you excuse me?
I've been told

106
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,791
that our hostess
wants to sing.

107
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:45,592
Why don't you sing
something for us?

108
00:07:53,606 --> 00:07:57,508
- # I'll hug you hard... #
- Whoo!

109
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:05,180
# I swear I'll hurt you bad #

110
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:11,451
# And at night
I'll start to burn #

111
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:15,984
# I'll be your star #

112
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:23,428
# Start walking, hurry, go! #

113
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,438
# 'Cause now I'm coming too #

114
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:30,772
# Darling, go, step on the gas! #

115
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,277
Good job, Elsa!

116
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:35,940
# The heat under my skin #

117
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:38,848
# Makes me see the stars #

118
00:08:38,918 --> 00:08:43,218
# Burst together with me. #

119
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:02,038
- Fuck!
- Elsa? Everything okay?

120
00:09:05,011 --> 00:09:08,344
Damn it!

121
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,974
What are you doing?

122
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:16,952
Come on, sweetie,
let's go. Let's go.

123
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,650
Be careful.

124
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:24,221
Thanks, darling.

125
00:09:24,297 --> 00:09:26,925
It was a wonderful party.

126
00:09:30,002 --> 00:09:32,527
All my friends were there,
all our friends.

127
00:09:32,605 --> 00:09:34,436
I had a great time.

128
00:09:34,507 --> 00:09:37,408
Everybody we know was there.

129
00:09:39,312 --> 00:09:41,610
Roberto didn't come.

130
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,239
- He couldn't make it.
- How come?

131
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:46,945
I don't know, Elsa.
I don't understand why.

132
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:49,544
Are you offended?

133
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:53,319
Come on, he must have been busy.
Let's forgive him.

134
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:59,558
# I'll hug you hard! #

135
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:03,295
# I swear I'll hurt you bad. #

136
00:10:03,369 --> 00:10:04,996
Shall we go to sleep?

137
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:06,595
- Are you sleepy?
- It's very late.

138
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:09,766
We stayed up very late.

139
00:10:09,842 --> 00:10:12,072
# I'll hug you hard! #

140
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:16,079
Oh God! Shit!

141
00:10:16,148 --> 00:10:18,946
You could have just turned it off.

142
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:24,387
- Come here.
- Tomorrow I'll glue it all together.

143
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:34,293
Oh, man.

144
00:10:41,273 --> 00:10:43,503
Ow!

145
00:10:48,147 --> 00:10:50,741
Oh, fuck.

146
00:10:59,191 --> 00:11:01,625
- Good morning, Daisy.
- Good morning, ma'am.

147
00:11:01,694 --> 00:11:04,754
- Did you hurt yourself?
- It's nothing, just a scratch.

148
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,196
What a mess. Sorry.

149
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:10,929
We'll get it all cleaned up.

150
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:12,664
Shall I make coffee?

151
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:15,172
Mr. Michele already made it.

152
00:11:15,241 --> 00:11:19,302
- My husband is still at home?
- Yes, in the study.

153
00:11:19,378 --> 00:11:20,777
Really?

154
00:11:28,888 --> 00:11:31,755
Michele, you don't feel well?

155
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,689
No, I'm fine.

156
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,728
Why are you here?

157
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,559
What happened to you?

158
00:11:38,631 --> 00:11:42,192
I cut myself
on the glass from the lamp.

159
00:11:42,268 --> 00:11:44,828
- Does it hurt?
- It's nothing.

160
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,473
What's going on?

161
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:52,170
I have to tell you something.

162
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:55,509
I waited till now 'cause
I didn't want to distract you,

163
00:11:55,581 --> 00:11:58,812
- 'cause I didn't want...
- Tell me.

164
00:12:00,352 --> 00:12:02,718
We can't go to Cambodia.

165
00:12:02,788 --> 00:12:04,813
Why not?

166
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:09,558
I haven't worked for two months.

167
00:12:11,964 --> 00:12:15,593
Weren't things going better
with this new partner? What was his name?

168
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:18,501
You don't understand.
They got rid of me.

169
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:22,364
What do you mean?

170
00:12:22,441 --> 00:12:25,205
Morelli agreed with Roberto
and they pushed me out of Miramar.

171
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:28,769
The company is yours.
How could they do that?

172
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,611
No, it belonged to the three of us.

173
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:32,844
You know Roberto is weak.

174
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:35,785
Since Morelli arrived,
everything has changed.

175
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:37,686
He convinced Roberto
to fire people,

176
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:41,591
diversify and move
all the production abroad

177
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,787
against my own will.

178
00:12:43,863 --> 00:12:46,957
Roberto and I have always
done things a certain way.

179
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:49,967
You know how I feel about things.
I found myself isolated,

180
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:52,936
disagreeing on everything.

181
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:55,166
And by being in the minority,

182
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,402
the company is in their hands.

183
00:12:57,476 --> 00:13:00,206
- They can't do that!
- Yes, they can.

184
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:03,976
They resigned, we voted
for a new board of directors

185
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:07,382
and they only re-elected themselves.

186
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:10,388
That's absurd!

187
00:13:10,456 --> 00:13:13,254
How could Roberto agree to that?

188
00:13:13,325 --> 00:13:16,192
Did you speak to him?

189
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:18,162
Have you two talked alone?

190
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:20,494
I don't see him anymore.

191
00:13:20,566 --> 00:13:23,694
- Don't you meet him in the office?
- I don't go there anymore.

192
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:26,499
- Since when?
- Two months!

193
00:13:26,572 --> 00:13:29,006
But I'm looking for another job,

194
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:32,009
I've had interviews, sent CVs.

195
00:13:32,077 --> 00:13:34,477
I'm looking around.

196
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,573
You didn't tell me anything.
It's absurd!

197
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:41,347
- Now what?
- Nothing.

198
00:13:41,420 --> 00:13:44,514
I'll find a new job
and I'll take care of stuff.

199
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,058
That's it.

200
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:49,924
Then...

201
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,097
Then?

202
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,225
Then there is the issue
with the house.

203
00:13:56,302 --> 00:13:59,328
- What house?
- This one.

204
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,805
Remember I used it
to guarantee the bank loan

205
00:14:04,877 --> 00:14:07,812
when we increased
the company capital?

206
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,849
More or less. So what?

207
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:14,010
The lawyer suggested

208
00:14:14,086 --> 00:14:15,815
that as long as
I'm in debt with the bank

209
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:19,551
my hands are tied
and I can't even sue those assholes.

210
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,616
Wait a minute.

211
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:25,323
What do you mean?

212
00:14:25,397 --> 00:14:27,490
Do we have to sell
the house?

213
00:14:29,969 --> 00:14:32,494
We'll find another one.
We can rent one.

214
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:40,937
Forgive me, Elsa.
I wanted to wait until you graduated.

215
00:14:43,582 --> 00:14:46,312
It's late.

216
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:48,649
Elsa, don't worry.
It's just a bad time.

217
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,690
It's very late.
I really must go.

218
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,145
Hi!

219
00:15:52,217 --> 00:15:54,811
Good girl!

220
00:15:54,887 --> 00:15:57,117
So?

221
00:15:57,189 --> 00:15:58,781
What did I tell you?

222
00:15:58,857 --> 00:16:02,224
Congratulations. You must tell me
everything. I'm so scared!

223
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:04,524
You'll do well too.

224
00:16:04,596 --> 00:16:06,723
How's it going here?

225
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:09,461
Come and see.

226
00:16:09,535 --> 00:16:12,629
Look what we found

227
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:15,697
while you were getting
your degree.

228
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:20,874
Look at these areas of color.

229
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,470
Beautiful.

230
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:25,381
Too bad you're leaving,
this is the best bit.

231
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,353
I don't know if I'm going now.

232
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:32,254
Really? How come?

233
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:34,758
- Aren't you taking the trip?
- We may put it off.

234
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:37,819
I'll continue up there.

235
00:16:42,101 --> 00:16:44,626
Are you going to tell me
something about your exam?

236
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:50,237
I was really scared!

237
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,335
What was the board like?

238
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,079
Michele?

239
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:01,517
Good evening.
Mrs. Oliveri?

240
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:03,077
Nice to meet you.
Buoncompagni.

241
00:17:03,155 --> 00:17:06,318
I'm showing the apartment
to Mr. and Mrs. Melzi.

242
00:17:07,926 --> 00:17:10,451
It's very well kept.
My compliments.

243
00:17:13,032 --> 00:17:14,795
Good evening.

244
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:16,562
Good evening.

245
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:18,933
Allow me to introduce you...
Mrs. Oliveri, the owner of the house.

246
00:17:19,004 --> 00:17:21,063
Yes, we agree.

247
00:17:22,841 --> 00:17:26,402
- You could've warned me.
- Fine, thank you.

248
00:17:26,478 --> 00:17:29,413
By tomorrow, yes.
Certainly, thanks.

249
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:31,312
Goodbye.

250
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:34,443
I've had a job offer.

251
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:37,788
A radiator company

252
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,915
is looking
for a production manager.

253
00:17:39,992 --> 00:17:42,392
I don't know much about it,

254
00:17:42,461 --> 00:17:44,520
but for some reason
they trust me.

255
00:17:44,596 --> 00:17:45,722
Good.

256
00:17:45,798 --> 00:17:47,493
The salary isn't amazing...

257
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:50,626
more or less half
of what I used to earn...

258
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:53,262
three weeks of vacation a year,

259
00:17:53,338 --> 00:17:55,033
my boss is
15 years younger than me.

260
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,132
15 years younger.

261
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:59,473
Isn't there anything better?

262
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:02,537
It's the first real offer I've had.

263
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:06,175
I have to give an answer
by tomorrow morning and I can't decide.

264
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:07,980
What do you think?

265
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:10,214
What do you want me to say?

266
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:12,553
You're wasted in a job like that.

267
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:14,114
At least if it was
in the boating business...

268
00:18:14,193 --> 00:18:17,685
True, but I know it'll be tough
to stay in that business.

269
00:18:17,763 --> 00:18:19,958
I've already tried to talk
to all my competitors.

270
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:23,092
They pat me on the back
but no definite offers.

271
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,498
I don't know, let's wait.
There'll be other offers.

272
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:32,209
It must have been
a horrible day for you.

273
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,336
You could've warned me
about them.

274
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,404
I should have told you earlier.
You are right.

275
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,507
You should have told me
two months ago.

276
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,575
You should have told me
right away, because this way,

277
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:42,176
all of a sudden,
all at the same time...

278
00:18:42,254 --> 00:18:43,653
- I'm sorry.
- I don't know anything

279
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:45,781
about the house,
the mortgage,

280
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:48,452
how much money we have, if any.

281
00:18:48,527 --> 00:18:50,290
I've been thinking
about it all day.

282
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,262
How much do we spend?

283
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:55,494
- How much do we need a month?
- Calm down, Elsa.

284
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:58,934
I hate not knowing things.
You must tell me everything.

285
00:18:59,004 --> 00:19:01,598
Excuse me, we're done.

286
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:05,200
- Is tomorrow at 3:00 all right?
- Yes, I'll show you the way out.

287
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:08,769
It was a fund, Elsa.
I sold it a long time ago.

288
00:19:08,847 --> 00:19:11,714
We had to give Alice her share
for the restaurant, remember?

289
00:19:11,783 --> 00:19:13,148
Okay.

290
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:17,154
So all we have left
is 21,575 euros?

291
00:19:17,222 --> 00:19:19,019
There's also the house
and I know there's the mortgage,

292
00:19:19,091 --> 00:19:21,286
but the sale price is good.
You should not worry.

293
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,725
I should not worry.

294
00:19:22,794 --> 00:19:25,262
You haven't earned
your salary in months.

295
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,991
We kept living
as if nothing had happened.

296
00:19:27,065 --> 00:19:29,966
We went to Tunisia.
We bought another computer.

297
00:19:30,035 --> 00:19:32,265
We lived like we always have!
Why didn't you tell me?

298
00:19:32,337 --> 00:19:35,329
If I'd told you before,
would we have solved anything?

299
00:19:38,610 --> 00:19:41,477
Okay. Now tell me.

300
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,777
These are our expenses, right?

301
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,783
Yes. So 850 euros
for the mortgage,

302
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:49,480
then service charges, cleaning lady,
various expenses totaling 4,000 euros.

303
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:52,319
- 4,000 euros?
- Everything included...

304
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:54,859
bills, cell phones, car, dock fees,

305
00:19:54,927 --> 00:19:56,417
the boat and also
my father's expenses.

306
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:59,396
That's a lot of money.
In five months we'll be broke.

307
00:19:59,464 --> 00:20:01,898
Try to at least be
a bit more optimistic.

308
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,832
So I am a pessimist now.
Am I a pessimist?

309
00:20:03,902 --> 00:20:06,393
No!

310
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,873
I'll find a job.

311
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,638
Meanwhile we'll move
and cut expenses.

312
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,338
Things will work out, you'll see.

313
00:20:14,413 --> 00:20:17,314
I have to go back
to work, right?

314
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,816
- You are already working.
- Too bad I never get paid.

315
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,682
You will soon.
You even graduated.

316
00:20:21,753 --> 00:20:25,120
Maybe in a year, maybe never.
Alice is here.

317
00:20:25,190 --> 00:20:27,158
- Hi.
- Hi, Alice.

318
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:28,955
- Is she sleeping here?
- I don't know.

319
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:31,723
What's this,
the five-year plan?

320
00:20:36,568 --> 00:20:40,231
With all those children
dying of hunger in the world...

321
00:20:40,305 --> 00:20:42,364
If you feel like preaching,

322
00:20:42,441 --> 00:20:44,341
start with Riki,
Mr. Indifference,

323
00:20:44,409 --> 00:20:46,434
or have you already decided
he's a lost cause?

324
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:50,072
Are you nuts, Dad?
I was kidding.

325
00:20:50,148 --> 00:20:51,979
What the fuck do you know
about Riki anyway?

326
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:55,281
He's worked since he was 16,
and he doesn't owe anything to anyone.

327
00:20:55,354 --> 00:20:57,151
The shop is
his father's, isn't it?

328
00:20:57,222 --> 00:20:59,850
If it weren't for Riki,
his father would still be selling blenders!

329
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,483
A real child prodigy.

330
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,551
- He's not an intellectual. So what?
- So nothing.

331
00:21:03,629 --> 00:21:06,393
But you gave Jacopo a hard time 'cause
he didn't read Thomas Bernhard.

332
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:08,626
Forget Jacopo!

333
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,998
Enough, both of you.
You bore me to death.

334
00:21:11,069 --> 00:21:13,537
Mom, he started it.
I was fine when I got here.

335
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,766
What would you have done
if you weren't fine, throw a grenade?

336
00:21:15,841 --> 00:21:18,002
I think it's better

337
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:20,067
if I stay at Riki's for a bit.

338
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,806
That way
we're all happier, no?

339
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,438
You'll be happy.

340
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:25,312
If you want to go to Riki's, go,

341
00:21:25,384 --> 00:21:27,318
but don't act like the one who
got thrown out of her parents' place!

342
00:21:27,386 --> 00:21:30,253
Fine. And excuse me
for saying so,

343
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:33,155
but you could have been
more enthusiastic about his gift.

344
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:35,193
Do you know how much
the UMTS cost?

345
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:37,694
- The UM... what?
- The cell phone.

346
00:21:37,763 --> 00:21:39,526
So what?
I did thank him.

347
00:21:39,598 --> 00:21:41,429
Do you have to thank
more or less now

348
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,559
depending on the price tag?

349
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:45,865
He didn't even buy it...
he sells them.

350
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:48,337
You really are
an asshole, Dad.

351
00:21:54,212 --> 00:21:57,306
- She doesn't know, does she?
- Alice? Are you nuts?

352
00:21:57,382 --> 00:21:59,907
- We'll have to tell her soon.
- We won't tell her anything.

353
00:22:06,224 --> 00:22:07,657
Bye.

354
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:11,355
Alice doesn't live
here anymore.

355
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:17,293
Let's eat something.

356
00:22:18,637 --> 00:22:20,867
Wait, there's something I don't get.

357
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:24,397
The party, the group,

358
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:25,943
the waiters, these earrings...

359
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:28,275
- how much did you spend?
- All that was left!

360
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:31,282
Tomorrow, bread and onions.
All right?

361
00:22:52,137 --> 00:22:53,900
Hi, Roberto.

362
00:22:53,972 --> 00:22:57,203
Elsa, how are you?

363
00:22:57,275 --> 00:23:00,676
That was Morelli, wasn't it?

364
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:02,976
Yes.

365
00:23:03,048 --> 00:23:04,640
How's Michele?

366
00:23:04,716 --> 00:23:08,049
What do you think?

367
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,021
I know what you're thinking.

368
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:13,489
We started when we were 20,
and it's not easy for me either.

369
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,549
I can imagine.

370
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:19,222
Do you know for how long we hadn't drawn
our salaries before Morelli came onboard?

371
00:23:19,297 --> 00:23:20,730
Michele told me.

372
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,166
He wanted Morelli onboard too.
You know that, right?

373
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,069
Yes, but he didn't think
you'd turn against him.

374
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,697
He said no to everything!

375
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,708
He said things would work out,

376
00:23:30,776 --> 00:23:33,210
that it was just a matter of time,

377
00:23:33,278 --> 00:23:35,712
but he knew that
if we didn't find a solution,

378
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:38,375
- we would have gone under.
- It depends on what solutions, right?

379
00:23:38,450 --> 00:23:41,351
It depends who is involved.
It depends on if friends are involved.

380
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:43,354
I'm sorry, no.

381
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:47,188
If he would have had
some ideas... but nothing!

382
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:50,228
If it was up to him,
everything would have gone to hell!

383
00:23:50,295 --> 00:23:52,058
How can you say that?

384
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:54,098
You know Michele,
you know what he thinks.

385
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,191
I have two families
to support, remember?

386
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,701
Luisa, the boys, the house,

387
00:23:57,769 --> 00:23:59,828
Giovanna, Matteo, another house.

388
00:23:59,905 --> 00:24:02,499
I can support shit with his ideals!

389
00:24:09,981 --> 00:24:12,973
- So that's a possibility?
- Yes, it is.

390
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:16,248
The savings, as I told you,
would be around 30%.

391
00:24:16,321 --> 00:24:19,552
The trouble is that
it would be difficult, knowing him,

392
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,855
to share his space
with someone else.

393
00:24:22,928 --> 00:24:24,725
- Okay.
- Let me know.

394
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:27,424
Thank you. Goodbye.

395
00:24:46,384 --> 00:24:48,352
Hi.

396
00:24:49,754 --> 00:24:52,689
- Is everything all right?
- With me, yes,

397
00:24:52,757 --> 00:24:55,555
but Sara is on her way out.

398
00:24:58,630 --> 00:25:00,689
Which one is Sara?

399
00:25:11,843 --> 00:25:13,743
I can't remember

400
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:17,248
who was my second mate
on the Victoria.

401
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,146
- Wasn't it Pozzati?
- No.

402
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:36,358
The truth is that
when you're born,

403
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:38,368
all they teach you is
to mind your own business.

404
00:25:38,436 --> 00:25:40,233
There's no civic sense.

405
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:43,103
- No manners either.
- Are you talking to me?

406
00:25:43,174 --> 00:25:46,143
Yes, Fabrizio was telling us
something and you interrupted.

407
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,339
- That's not true!
- Actually, it is.

408
00:25:49,414 --> 00:25:51,279
- I believe she's right.
- Come on, tell us.

409
00:25:51,349 --> 00:25:53,840
We got a new system
for cataloguing the warehouse

410
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:55,409
and the warehouse clerk,
Antonio...

411
00:25:55,487 --> 00:25:57,455
- remember him?
- Yes.

412
00:25:57,522 --> 00:25:59,956
- he's never learned
how to use a computer.

413
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:02,755
He does everything with pen and paper,
if you can believe that.

414
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:04,818
- Do you have to fire him?
- I'm afraid so.

415
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:08,195
But he'll get a big severance check.
He's going into early retirement.

416
00:26:08,266 --> 00:26:10,427
If I could find him a little job,

417
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:12,333
even part-time...

418
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:15,032
maybe you need
an odd-job man?

419
00:26:16,374 --> 00:26:18,968
Maybe you could talk
to the others.

420
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:20,944
I can ask them, of course.

421
00:26:21,012 --> 00:26:23,105
Yes, but no obligation.

422
00:26:23,181 --> 00:26:25,342
Antonio's a really valuable guy.

423
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,908
If we don't give him a hand...

424
00:26:27,986 --> 00:26:30,250
No, Michele.
No way. Come on!

425
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:32,483
Why should you always pay?

426
00:26:32,557 --> 00:26:35,993
In fact.
Let's split it in half, please.

427
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:38,586
- Michele, next time...
- Okay.

428
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:39,721
...it'll be on us.

429
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,631
- Shall we go by Porta Soprana?
- No.

430
00:26:43,702 --> 00:26:47,069
- It's nicer there, come on.
- I said no.

431
00:26:47,138 --> 00:26:49,766
- Why?
- Because I want to go home.

432
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:55,345
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

433
00:26:55,413 --> 00:26:58,348
Is it because
I paid for dinner?

434
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:00,509
Do you think we have
money to throw away?

435
00:27:00,585 --> 00:27:02,883
Let's stop eating out then.

436
00:27:05,056 --> 00:27:07,923
Who organized
the evening? Me?

437
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,659
Now it's my fault?

438
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,594
What do you want me to do?

439
00:27:12,664 --> 00:27:15,827
Tell Fabrizio and Nadia that
they have to pay because we're broke?

440
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:17,561
Do you want me to do that?

441
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:20,605
I don't want us to do
things we can't afford.

442
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:24,941
190 euros won't solve anything,
or do you think they will?

443
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:26,568
Stop it!

444
00:27:27,679 --> 00:27:29,510
I don't give a damn
about the 200 euros.

445
00:27:29,581 --> 00:27:32,049
What I care about is that you don't have
a job and I don't earn anything,

446
00:27:32,117 --> 00:27:34,847
and that soon we won't have
a house anymore.

447
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:36,853
And we cannot
even talk about it with our friends.

448
00:27:36,921 --> 00:27:38,786
I told you
it'll all work out.

449
00:27:38,857 --> 00:27:40,882
How the fuck can
you be so sure?

450
00:27:40,959 --> 00:27:43,587
I can't go on pretending.
I'm scared.

451
00:27:43,662 --> 00:27:46,597
- Don't be.
- I'm terrified.

452
00:27:46,665 --> 00:27:50,032
If we pretend nothing's wrong,
others will pretend too,

453
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:53,595
- like that asshole Roberto.
- What's he got to do with it?

454
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:56,436
- I went to see him.
- What?

455
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,703
Why didn't you tell me?

456
00:27:58,777 --> 00:28:00,711
Look who's talking!

457
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,507
- When did you go?
- I don't know. Tuesday.

458
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:06,209
Why, Elsa?

459
00:28:06,284 --> 00:28:09,117
I wanted to look him in the eyes
and understand what happened.

460
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,280
Do you think it was my fault?

461
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,975
Do you really want
to hear what I think?

462
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:34,875
You're a pain in the ass

463
00:28:34,946 --> 00:28:37,414
and that we should have accepted
that ride that Fabrizio offered,

464
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:39,950
because my foot still hurts.

465
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:42,612
- Still?
- Yes.

466
00:28:42,687 --> 00:28:44,678
What are you doing?
Are you nuts?

467
00:28:44,756 --> 00:28:46,747
- Put me down!
- So I'm a pain in the ass?

468
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:48,122
No no no.
Put me down!

469
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:01,738
Michele.

470
00:29:03,675 --> 00:29:06,439
Daisy's leaving.

471
00:29:06,511 --> 00:29:08,945
Permanently?

472
00:29:09,013 --> 00:29:11,072
Yes, she's already
got another job.

473
00:29:11,149 --> 00:29:12,980
They need her full time.

474
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:15,884
She wants her severance pay.

475
00:29:15,954 --> 00:29:18,115
She's right.

476
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:19,918
I know.

477
00:29:19,991 --> 00:29:23,324
I told her to get it calculated.
It's about 6,200 euros.

478
00:29:23,394 --> 00:29:25,726
Fuck.

479
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:30,000
I'll ask if I can
give her some now

480
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:31,831
and the rest in a month.

481
00:29:31,903 --> 00:29:33,632
Maybe you'll have
a job by then.

482
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:35,502
It's all right.

483
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:40,536
Let's sell the boat.
Let's give her her money, period.

484
00:29:40,612 --> 00:29:42,910
Do you really
want to sell it?

485
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,643
You told me we won't
make much by selling it.

486
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:47,947
True, but there's
no sense keeping it.

487
00:29:49,854 --> 00:29:51,788
I'm sorry.

488
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:54,188
So am I.

489
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:04,259
Elsa, about the dinner
at the Marinis...

490
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:07,394
I don't want to go.

491
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:10,532
I don't want to pretend.
I don't want to lie.

492
00:30:14,579 --> 00:30:17,343
Okay.

493
00:30:21,286 --> 00:30:23,618
What's up, Dad?

494
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:26,054
How come you're not at work?

495
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:28,092
I've taken a sabbatical.
And you?

496
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:33,563
I had a fight with Riki.
Are you glad?

497
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,995
You don't get it.
You think I'm glad if you're unhappy?

498
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,004
I think I should be happy

499
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:44,235
- the way you want me to be.
- Alice, what should I do?

500
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:45,674
Act like people who say,

501
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:48,439
"If you're happy,
that's enough for me"?

502
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,811
Do you want
a dad like that?

503
00:30:55,486 --> 00:30:59,320
I will admit, though,
I imagined someone different for you.

504
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,950
You always have to imagine
everything for everyone.

505
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,494
Why don't you relax, Dad?
You'd live better

506
00:31:04,562 --> 00:31:06,291
and make others around you
live better too.

507
00:31:06,364 --> 00:31:08,298
What does "better" mean:
superficially,

508
00:31:08,366 --> 00:31:10,425
without accepting
your own responsibility?

509
00:31:10,501 --> 00:31:14,198
That's the result of never opposing
anything in this country.

510
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,740
Not the political speech!
I haven't even had my coffee.

511
00:31:16,808 --> 00:31:19,606
Oh, sorry.
The political speech. Sorry.

512
00:31:19,677 --> 00:31:22,009
Want some too?

513
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:24,071
Well, maybe half a cup.

514
00:31:24,148 --> 00:31:26,639
With that disgusting sweetener?

515
00:31:26,718 --> 00:31:28,310
Not the health speech.

516
00:31:37,996 --> 00:31:39,827
What's there?

517
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,490
There is...

518
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:44,364
There's something
underneath here.

519
00:31:44,435 --> 00:31:47,962
Elsa, come and look at this.

520
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:51,166
What is it? A dolphin?

521
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,972
No. It's a little bird,
can't you see?

522
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,843
- It could be a goldfinch.
- So?

523
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,941
So there could be
a Nativity under here.

524
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:02,552
How come?

525
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,282
Sometimes it appears
as a Nativity symbol.

526
00:32:05,356 --> 00:32:09,087
Well, it certainly appears
in the Madonna and Child.

527
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,458
Wait.

528
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,589
It could also be
an Adoration of the Magi, no?

529
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:17,635
Let's first try to understand

530
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:20,933
what kind of bird it is,
and then we can start guessing, okay?

531
00:32:29,047 --> 00:32:31,538
My role evolved
in the last 10 years

532
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:33,641
as the firm expanded
and the turnover increased...

533
00:32:33,718 --> 00:32:35,481
in production, obviously.

534
00:32:35,553 --> 00:32:37,521
The commercial side
is not for me.

535
00:32:37,588 --> 00:32:39,180
I'd say it's all clear.

536
00:32:39,257 --> 00:32:42,090
I don't have anything suitable

537
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:43,787
for a man of your experience,

538
00:32:43,861 --> 00:32:46,591
but your details will be inserted
into our database.

539
00:32:46,664 --> 00:32:49,224
I guarantee that you'll get
special consideration.

540
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:52,098
- I have a question.
- Of course.

541
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:57,196
I realize my age
might be an obstacle...

542
00:32:57,275 --> 00:32:59,402
That's no longer true.
Excuse me for interrupting.

543
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,969
Companies look for experience
when filling certain roles.

544
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:06,312
You might need
to be flexible

545
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:09,683
where salary is concerned,

546
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,312
of course.

547
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:15,189
I kind of wonder if I should lower
my expectations.

548
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:16,783
In my situation,

549
00:33:16,861 --> 00:33:18,328
maybe I should be happy
with a bit less.

550
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:20,125
No, you shouldn't, believe me.

551
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:22,723
It would be a mistake
to voluntarily undersell yourself.

552
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,360
Also remember that firms

553
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:27,233
aren't interested
in hiring someone

554
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:30,797
who could eventually cause trouble
because they're dissatisfied.

555
00:33:30,875 --> 00:33:32,809
Among your personal
characteristics

556
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:35,744
you indicated mental flexibility.

557
00:33:35,813 --> 00:33:38,441
Can you give me an example?

558
00:33:38,516 --> 00:33:41,883
Well, in my previous job
there were many kinds of problems...

559
00:33:41,953 --> 00:33:44,979
in an airport, emergencies are
the order of the day.

560
00:33:45,056 --> 00:33:48,423
Listen. How about
doing a trial call?

561
00:33:48,493 --> 00:33:50,085
What do you mean?

562
00:33:50,161 --> 00:33:54,063
You call me at home and try
to sell me a subscription

563
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:57,158
to a women's weekly
at half the newsstand price.

564
00:33:57,235 --> 00:33:59,066
A pretend call?

565
00:33:59,137 --> 00:34:01,833
Yes yes. Ring ring.
The phone's ringing.

566
00:34:01,906 --> 00:34:03,840
Okay.

567
00:34:03,908 --> 00:34:05,375
Hello. Good morning, ma'am.

568
00:34:05,443 --> 00:34:08,674
I'm calling to offer you
a subscription to a women's weekly,

569
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:11,180
"Snow White Today."

570
00:34:11,249 --> 00:34:15,049
I'm not interested
and I don't want to spend money.

571
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,552
It's very reasonable,

572
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:18,589
half the newsstand price.

573
00:34:26,264 --> 00:34:28,198
Michele.

574
00:34:29,934 --> 00:34:31,697
Here you are.

575
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,705
Jump in,
I'll take you for a cruise.

576
00:34:35,773 --> 00:34:38,742
- Don't we have to move?
- There's time. We're going out now.

577
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:15,608
They hired me
at a call center...

578
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,409
a month's trial.

579
00:35:20,418 --> 00:35:22,215
It's only three hours a day,

580
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,754
and I can fit in
the restoration too.

581
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:29,089
I'll get 500 euros a month.

582
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,890
Is it really necessary?

583
00:35:35,399 --> 00:35:38,300
Yes, it is.

584
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:55,319
How about these?

585
00:35:57,355 --> 00:35:59,152
Well...

586
00:35:59,223 --> 00:36:01,817
throw them away.
They're old.

587
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:08,564
The pictures?

588
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:10,692
Better keep them.

589
00:36:14,138 --> 00:36:17,107
So you came here
instead of going to work?

590
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:21,509
Yes, here too...
my floating office.

591
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,981
That's why you always told me
to call your cell phone.

592
00:36:26,050 --> 00:36:29,577
What an idiot!
Why didn't I understand?

593
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:33,556
I only did it
so you could study in peace.

594
00:36:36,661 --> 00:36:39,528
Do you know what I thought
when I saw your face that morning?

595
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,360
What?

596
00:36:42,633 --> 00:36:44,828
"Here we go again...
another woman."

597
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:48,668
Not again.
It was six years ago.

598
00:36:48,739 --> 00:36:52,436
I remember your face clearly...
it was identical.

599
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:54,569
Actually,

600
00:36:54,645 --> 00:36:56,613
maybe I'd have preferred it.

601
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:01,811
I don't believe you.

602
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,979
Well, I wouldn't have preferred it.

603
00:37:13,998 --> 00:37:15,659
Shall we go?

604
00:37:23,908 --> 00:37:26,502
Sir! Mr. Olivieri!

605
00:37:28,246 --> 00:37:30,908
Oh... Vito, good morning.

606
00:37:30,982 --> 00:37:33,246
- How are you?
- Fine.

607
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:34,909
- Do you remember Luciano?
- Of course.

608
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:37,648
- Hello, sir, everything okay?
- My wife Elsa.

609
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:39,781
- How do you do?
- Good morning.

610
00:37:39,857 --> 00:37:41,654
- How are things going?
- So-so.

611
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:44,661
Luciano found a job but...
but it didn't work out.

612
00:37:44,729 --> 00:37:46,526
It lasted a month.

613
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,725
The owner's brother-in-law arrived
and he told him,

614
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,360
"What can I do?
He's my wife's brother."

615
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:54,427
Sorry to hear that.
Nothing else has turned up?

616
00:37:54,505 --> 00:37:56,666
We're on unemployment.

617
00:37:56,741 --> 00:37:59,767
How come you're out here,
loaded down like that?

618
00:37:59,844 --> 00:38:02,608
I'm selling my boat.
It's getting a bit old

619
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,614
and these aren't exactly

620
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:06,809
times of plenty.

621
00:38:06,884 --> 00:38:09,853
Sir, we wanted to call you

622
00:38:09,920 --> 00:38:11,979
several times.

623
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:14,718
We heard you left
the company

624
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:17,056
and that you didn't agree
on lots of things

625
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:19,028
and we wanted
to thank you.

626
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,963
I only did what seemed right.

627
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,933
Do you think
that counts for nothing?

628
00:38:24,001 --> 00:38:26,435
Not that it helped much.

629
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,506
Can I buy you a drink?

630
00:38:29,573 --> 00:38:32,041
- No. Not now.
- Maybe some other time,

631
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:35,010
- duty calls.
- Do you fish here at the port?

632
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,274
The mullet bite like
a dream here.

633
00:38:37,348 --> 00:38:40,476
You have to leave us
at least one pleasure in life!

634
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:16,516
Please come in.

635
00:39:23,961 --> 00:39:26,521
Mr. Oliveri?

636
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,296
Good morning.
Please sit down.

637
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:47,449
A wonderful bath with essential oils,
a wide choice of treatments.

638
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:49,611
For example, balsamic, relaxing,

639
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:52,087
energizing, winding-down.

640
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:54,647
So you don't have
a bathtub?

641
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:58,422
Mrs. Donata, if you look
on the next page of our catalogue

642
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:01,090
I'd advise you
to try our body creams.

643
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:04,259
They're full of dietary minerals
to keep your skin soft and supple.

644
00:40:04,335 --> 00:40:07,361
I guarantee that after
a shower, they're ideal.

645
00:40:10,107 --> 00:40:12,007
I'm starting to hallucinate.

646
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:15,136
- Bye, Elsa.
- Bye, Cristina. See you tomorrow.

647
00:40:15,212 --> 00:40:17,305
Can I borrow
your car then?

648
00:40:17,381 --> 00:40:19,406
Don't you want lunch?

649
00:40:19,483 --> 00:40:22,611
- I have to go to the restoration.
- Not even half an hour?

650
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:30,918
Absolutely nothing happened.

651
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:33,190
It was as if I hadn't gone.

652
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:35,255
Why? What did they tell you?

653
00:40:35,332 --> 00:40:38,301
First, he was impressed
with my tie,

654
00:40:38,369 --> 00:40:41,532
then he asked me if I thought
I was satisfied about my life,

655
00:40:41,605 --> 00:40:43,129
and then...
listen to this one...

656
00:40:43,207 --> 00:40:46,540
"How big should the slice
of life dedicated to work be?"

657
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:48,475
What did you say?

658
00:40:48,546 --> 00:40:50,912
It depends on the cake.

659
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:52,915
Are you crazy?

660
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:55,076
Anyway, the morning's over.

661
00:40:55,152 --> 00:40:58,087
Now I have to survive the afternoon.

662
00:41:01,225 --> 00:41:03,250
It's Nadia.

663
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:04,624
She keeps calling me.

664
00:41:08,065 --> 00:41:10,590
Elsa, do you remember Claudio,

665
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:12,499
my friend, the architect?

666
00:41:12,570 --> 00:41:13,730
Yes.

667
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,034
Remember that I loaned him
6,000,000 liras?

668
00:41:16,106 --> 00:41:18,666
Yes. Didn't he give them back?

669
00:41:18,742 --> 00:41:20,801
No.

670
00:41:20,878 --> 00:41:23,870
I know it wouldn't help much,

671
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:27,406
and it also makes me feel
very embarrassed...

672
00:41:27,485 --> 00:41:30,181
But it's fair, though.

673
00:41:30,254 --> 00:41:31,585
There's nothing wrong
with asking for it back.

674
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,350
I know.

675
00:41:33,424 --> 00:41:36,052
Going to a friend to ask for money
after so many years,

676
00:41:36,126 --> 00:41:37,559
for 3,000 euros.

677
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:39,755
But we need them, Michele.

678
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:41,559
I know. I know.

679
00:41:44,602 --> 00:41:46,365
Do you feel like coming
to see the fresco?

680
00:41:54,979 --> 00:41:57,038
Come on. I'm late.

681
00:42:08,392 --> 00:42:11,225
- Are you ready?
- Yes.

682
00:42:21,739 --> 00:42:23,764
- Here's the coffee.
- Thanks.

683
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,306
We work like slaves.

684
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:31,109
You too, I guess,
like everybody else.

685
00:42:31,181 --> 00:42:33,945
Thank God I like what I do,
otherwise I'd die.

686
00:42:34,018 --> 00:42:35,849
On holiday I sleep
for the first three days.

687
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:38,480
I might as well leave
three days later.

688
00:42:42,927 --> 00:42:45,987
Listen, Claudio,

689
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:48,327
do you remember that
I lent you some money a few years ago,

690
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,061
- 6,000,000 liras?
- Of course I remember,

691
00:42:51,135 --> 00:42:53,399
when I opened my office. Why?

692
00:42:53,470 --> 00:42:56,439
I wondered

693
00:42:56,507 --> 00:42:59,476
if you could give it back to me.

694
00:42:59,543 --> 00:43:01,773
I already gave it back.

695
00:43:01,845 --> 00:43:04,075
- You're kidding.
- No.

696
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:06,810
I gave it back to you

697
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:09,318
about a year later.

698
00:43:09,386 --> 00:43:12,878
I remember it well...
I was working

699
00:43:12,957 --> 00:43:15,016
on Bortolotto's house.

700
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:17,322
I may have given it
to you in cash.

701
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:19,794
No, you didn't pay me back.

702
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:23,390
I assure you
that I gave it back.

703
00:43:23,467 --> 00:43:25,458
You're wrong.
You gave me nothing.

704
00:43:25,536 --> 00:43:27,731
No, you are wrong.

705
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:30,832
For example, we have
several vacancies for hotel work,

706
00:44:30,901 --> 00:44:34,428
even spot contracts
for two days,

707
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:35,563
like Monday, Tuesday.

708
00:44:35,639 --> 00:44:37,436
Take a seat.

709
00:44:37,508 --> 00:44:40,204
Front office, phone operator,

710
00:44:40,277 --> 00:44:41,767
receptionist.

711
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:44,109
Giving out room keys?

712
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,206
Everything that has
to do with the desk.

713
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:49,810
But if you don't like that option,
you can indicate it on the appropriate form.

714
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:53,220
But consider that since
we're the first ones to be flexible,

715
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,952
we insist
on a certain flexibility as well.

716
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,221
I understand.
Only hotel work?

717
00:44:58,295 --> 00:45:00,559
No, also data entry,
accounting, sales,

718
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:02,929
administrative, secretarial,

719
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,991
doorman in buildings or firms

720
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:06,593
or private chauffeur, courier.

721
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,729
- Do you drive?
- Yes.

722
00:45:08,806 --> 00:45:12,640
I'm not clear about something though,
have you lost your job?

723
00:45:15,546 --> 00:45:18,481
You found a parking space
right in front of the house.

724
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,779
That's a dream nowadays.

725
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:23,615
Yes. The view
sure is marvelous.

726
00:45:25,122 --> 00:45:27,488
Excuse me.

727
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,219
So is the heating autonomous?

728
00:45:29,293 --> 00:45:32,091
Yes, and the boiler was
upgraded less than a year ago.

729
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:34,630
The kitchen is over here.

730
00:45:37,801 --> 00:45:40,770
Nadia, how are you?

731
00:45:40,838 --> 00:45:43,398
Yes, everything's fine.

732
00:45:43,474 --> 00:45:47,274
No, forgive me.
My cell phone's faulty...

733
00:45:47,344 --> 00:45:50,108
it doesn't show
who's called me.

734
00:45:50,180 --> 00:45:52,512
I feel much better.

735
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:56,019
It's just that the restoration's
going really quickly

736
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:58,179
and I've no time
for anything.

737
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:01,424
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

738
00:46:01,492 --> 00:46:03,824
This is Mrs. Parodi.
Mr. Oliveri, the owner of the house.

739
00:46:03,894 --> 00:46:05,885
- Nice to meet you.
- We were just about to leave.

740
00:46:05,963 --> 00:46:08,659
I need to talk to you
for a moment.

741
00:46:08,732 --> 00:46:10,962
Sure. I'll finish with the lady
and be right with you.

742
00:46:11,034 --> 00:46:12,865
- All right. Bye.
- Bye.

743
00:46:27,251 --> 00:46:29,981
- What's happening?
- What do you mean?

744
00:46:30,053 --> 00:46:32,214
Why can't you manage
to sell this house?

745
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:34,314
A lot of people are interested,

746
00:46:34,391 --> 00:46:37,792
but they balk at the price.

747
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:39,726
You made the estimate.

748
00:46:39,797 --> 00:46:41,287
It's also a question of time.

749
00:46:41,365 --> 00:46:43,765
If you need an urgent sale...

750
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:46,200
How much should
we lower the price?

751
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:47,464
At least 100.

752
00:46:47,538 --> 00:46:49,699
100 what?

753
00:46:53,343 --> 00:46:55,607
100,000 euros less.

754
00:46:57,548 --> 00:47:00,073
Maybe you'd like
to think about it.

755
00:47:00,150 --> 00:47:01,412
Good night.

756
00:47:13,397 --> 00:47:15,092
Bye.

757
00:47:32,382 --> 00:47:35,283
Why don't we eat out?

758
00:47:38,722 --> 00:47:40,690
Yes.

759
00:47:42,259 --> 00:47:45,251
This is for Mom
and this is for you.

760
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:47,092
Didn't Jacopo
take your wine order?

761
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:50,998
Not yet, but don't worry.

762
00:47:51,068 --> 00:47:54,094
You look cute
in the candlelight.

763
00:47:56,106 --> 00:47:59,405
It feels weird. I cooked her meals
for years, now she's serving us food.

764
00:47:59,476 --> 00:48:01,706
Feels weird to me too.
Actually, it pisses me off.

765
00:48:01,778 --> 00:48:03,746
Don't start.

766
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:06,476
To think of how hard
you worked for your degree

767
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,142
when she could
take it easy,

768
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,482
she could study,
travel, have fun,

769
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:12,044
but she's waiting tables here.

770
00:48:12,122 --> 00:48:14,283
She's not a waitress,
she's half-owner.

771
00:48:14,358 --> 00:48:15,757
Please, stop it.

772
00:48:17,094 --> 00:48:19,654
I've brought you
the wine myself.

773
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:22,731
That's enough.

774
00:48:25,702 --> 00:48:28,728
- It's very good.
- I brought the most expensive one.

775
00:48:30,941 --> 00:48:34,502
Serving tables in an apron.
That's my daughter.

776
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:37,445
Then there's my wife,
cooped up in some dump

777
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:40,244
with loads of people,
selling ham, creams

778
00:48:40,317 --> 00:48:42,410
and who the fuck
knows what else.

779
00:48:42,486 --> 00:48:43,783
That's enough.

780
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:45,845
You're right.
Enough.

781
00:48:45,923 --> 00:48:47,754
At least you two do something.
You do what you can.

782
00:48:47,824 --> 00:48:51,282
I haven't done a fucking thing in months.
I don't earn. I don't produce.

783
00:48:51,361 --> 00:48:53,295
Michele, you're looking for work.

784
00:48:53,363 --> 00:48:55,422
Cut it out, please.

785
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:59,299
Eat. Alice is looking at us.

786
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:02,532
I'm an idiot.
That radiator company job...

787
00:49:02,606 --> 00:49:04,597
I shouldn't have said no.

788
00:49:04,675 --> 00:49:06,905
We said no.
It was a mutual decision.

789
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:08,945
You weren't involved.

790
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,479
Keep your voice down.

791
00:49:45,048 --> 00:49:47,278
Rosemary.

792
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:53,819
How do we cook it?

793
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:57,382
Poached squash with garlic.

794
00:49:57,461 --> 00:49:59,395
Look at the TV camera, chef,
don't look at me.

795
00:49:59,463 --> 00:50:02,728
Poached squash with garlic...

796
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:22,945
Give me something, anything.

797
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,420
What have you got
available today?

798
00:50:46,410 --> 00:50:48,344
- Yes?
- Parcel service.

799
00:50:48,412 --> 00:50:50,039
I have an envelope to deliver.

800
00:51:44,835 --> 00:51:47,702
He's always there, every time!
I just don't understand.

801
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,602
It's like all of a sudden

802
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:51,664
I decided to open
a store with my ex!

803
00:51:55,112 --> 00:51:57,945
You'd jump for joy, right?

804
00:52:20,604 --> 00:52:23,300
Michele, Alice is here.

805
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:25,807
- Is she?
- She says she saw you on a scooter,

806
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:28,606
delivering packages.
Was it you?

807
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:30,202
Yes, it was me.

808
00:52:32,315 --> 00:52:34,249
Why?

809
00:52:36,186 --> 00:52:38,916
They offered it and I accepted.
That's all.

810
00:52:40,724 --> 00:52:42,453
- Where's Alice?
- In there.

811
00:52:42,526 --> 00:52:45,154
I told her everything.
I couldn't stand it anymore.

812
00:52:45,228 --> 00:52:47,423
- How did she take it?
- She's shocked.

813
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:51,263
We should have told her right away.
She's very worried.

814
00:53:01,478 --> 00:53:03,412
I want to give back
the money you lent me.

815
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,209
I'll sell my share
of the business.

816
00:53:05,282 --> 00:53:08,342
Not gonna happen. It wasn't a loan,
it was for your studies.

817
00:53:08,418 --> 00:53:10,716
You decided to open
a restaurant. End of story.

818
00:53:10,787 --> 00:53:13,483
You won't even let
anybody help you.

819
00:53:13,557 --> 00:53:15,354
Right, let's see
how you'd help me.

820
00:53:15,425 --> 00:53:18,724
- I could ask Riki, he's bound to have...
- Great!

821
00:53:18,795 --> 00:53:20,285
I'll be a salesman
in Riki's shop,

822
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,888
your mom can dress the window,
then all of us together,

823
00:53:22,966 --> 00:53:24,456
you, me, Riki,
Riki's grandfather...

824
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:26,468
He can't treat me like a child.

825
00:53:26,536 --> 00:53:28,731
He always makes cracks
about Riki.

826
00:53:28,805 --> 00:53:31,069
He's my boyfriend.
I don't care if you two don't like him!

827
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:33,268
I like him. Dad!

828
00:53:33,343 --> 00:53:36,039
Riki would never get himself
into this kind of mess!

829
00:53:36,112 --> 00:53:38,410
- You can cope by yourself?
- Stop it!

830
00:53:38,481 --> 00:53:42,178
Mom working in a call center
and you delivering packages!

831
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:44,152
- Wow, you're doing a great job at coping.
- Alice!

832
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:47,657
And let's not tell anyone
or we'll look like idiots.

833
00:53:47,724 --> 00:53:50,454
- Don't talk to me like that!
- I'll say what I fucking want!

834
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:53,459
Fuck you!

835
00:53:57,834 --> 00:54:00,200
Alice! Wait, come on!

836
00:54:08,612 --> 00:54:10,944
Michele.

837
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:24,289
Darling, please don't do this.

838
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:27,194
I've messed everything up.

839
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:29,732
Please, stop it. Stop it.

840
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:49,543
Nice place, isn't it?

841
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:55,053
Ever since you called me,
I've been waiting to hug you.

842
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,423
Forgive me, Nadia,

843
00:54:57,494 --> 00:54:59,894
I didn't want to lie to you.

844
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:02,056
I just thought...

845
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:05,260
it would all work out.

846
00:55:05,335 --> 00:55:08,566
Of course it will.
Everything will be all right.

847
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:15,877
I asked to do an extra shift.

848
00:55:19,549 --> 00:55:21,915
Why did you wait so long?

849
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:24,351
Why didn't you ask me for help?

850
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,722
I was ashamed, Nadia.

851
00:55:29,259 --> 00:55:32,092
I'm sorry.

852
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,568
Sir?

853
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:44,106
Please.

854
00:55:45,305 --> 00:55:51,459
Better than Tinder on
