[stifled scream]

1393
01:17:54,169 --> 01:17:56,754
Where are they?
[gasps]

1394
01:18:07,891 --> 01:18:11,394
- Where were you going, Mom?

1395
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:14,146
- Ben, I really don't see
that that's important.

1396
01:18:14,272 --> 01:18:16,273
- I just want
to get everything straight.

1397
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:17,525
[knock at door]

1398
01:18:17,651 --> 01:18:20,111
- [gasps]

1399
01:18:23,865 --> 01:18:26,534
- I had chest pains.

1400
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:31,414
[crying] I feel like the gods
are punishing me.

1401
01:18:31,540 --> 01:18:33,249
- Oh, please stop being
such an egomaniac

1402
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:35,084
and drink your tea.

1403
01:18:35,210 --> 01:18:38,879
- You forgive me, Pippa?

1404
01:18:39,005 --> 01:18:40,423
- Forgive her for what?

1405
01:18:40,549 --> 01:18:44,635
- [weakly]
Oh, I-I can't.

1406
01:18:44,761 --> 01:18:47,513
- Ben, your father
and Sandra were-

1407
01:18:47,639 --> 01:18:49,849
They-they're in love.

1408
01:18:49,975 --> 01:18:51,767
That's why I was leaving.

1409
01:18:51,893 --> 01:18:53,227
- What?

1410
01:18:53,353 --> 01:18:54,437
- I'll jump out the window.

1411
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:57,523
I'm so stupid.
I'm stupid.

1412
01:18:57,649 --> 01:19:00,151
I'm just so selfish.

1413
01:19:00,277 --> 01:19:02,987
I'll jump out the window
if you don't forgive me.

1414
01:19:03,113 --> 01:19:04,613
I'm so...
- I forgive you.

1415
01:19:04,740 --> 01:19:07,450
Get up. Get up, please.
Okay.

1416
01:19:09,411 --> 01:19:11,120
- You do not forgive her.

1417
01:19:11,246 --> 01:19:12,955
- You're right. I don't.

1418
01:19:13,081 --> 01:19:14,623
- How could Dad
do that to you?

1419
01:19:14,750 --> 01:19:19,128
- Sweetheart, he...
was afraid of dying.

1420
01:19:19,254 --> 01:19:21,630
He fell in love.

1421
01:19:21,757 --> 01:19:26,427
And I wasn't altogether there
either, as of late.

1422
01:19:26,553 --> 01:19:27,636
So I don't know.

1423
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:29,388
- Do you even care?

1424
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,518
- How can I compete
with that?

1425
01:19:39,441 --> 01:19:40,983
- Hi. Where is he?

1426
01:19:41,109 --> 01:19:42,234
- Oh, sweetheart.

1427
01:19:42,360 --> 01:19:44,737
- Mrs. Lee?
You have a phone call.

1428
01:19:44,863 --> 01:19:46,280
- Okay, Ben,
will you take her in?

1429
01:19:46,406 --> 01:19:48,407
- Yeah.
- I'll be right back.

1430
01:19:48,533 --> 01:19:49,575
Hello?

1431
01:19:49,701 --> 01:19:51,994
- I just want to say,
in all the world,

1432
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:53,496
you are the one person

1433
01:19:53,622 --> 01:19:55,706
to whom none of this
should be happening.

1434
01:19:55,832 --> 01:19:56,999
- Thank you, Sam.

1435
01:19:57,125 --> 01:19:58,334
- And I also want to say

1436
01:19:58,460 --> 01:20:01,128
that I love you.

1437
01:20:01,254 --> 01:20:02,588
- Me too.

1438
01:20:02,714 --> 01:20:04,089
- I mean, really.

1439
01:20:04,216 --> 01:20:05,758
- Oh.

1440
01:20:08,637 --> 01:20:09,553
- Call you later.

1441
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:10,638
- [slowly] Okay.
- Bye.

1442
01:20:10,764 --> 01:20:14,016
- Sam?
- Yeah?

1443
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:19,188
- I don't want to make
butterflied lamb anymore.

1444
01:20:19,314 --> 01:20:21,398
- Oh.

1445
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:24,318
- Do you see
what I'm saying?

1446
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:31,242
- Why did Ben get to stay?

1447
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:33,994
- I don't know.
He seemed to want it the most.

1448
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:35,704
- Really?
How do you measure that?

1449
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:39,250
Do you have some sort
of love-ometer?

1450
01:20:39,376 --> 01:20:41,544
- Why don't we go home for
a few hours and rest and then...

1451
01:20:41,670 --> 01:20:44,588
- Has someone
been smoking in here?

1452
01:20:44,714 --> 01:20:46,841
- I don't know.

1453
01:20:46,967 --> 01:20:48,467
- Yuck.

1454
01:20:51,179 --> 01:20:52,888
Was it Daddy?

1455
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:54,139
- What?

1456
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:55,891
- Well, if Daddy's been smoking,
then maybe-

1457
01:20:56,017 --> 01:20:57,977
- No. No.

1458
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:02,106
- So his brain is just dead?

1459
01:21:02,232 --> 01:21:04,733
It's just completely dead?

1460
01:21:04,860 --> 01:21:07,736
He'll never say anything
ever again?

1461
01:21:07,863 --> 01:21:10,781
Not one thing?

1462
01:21:10,907 --> 01:21:15,244
- That's what the doctors
are telling us, sweetheart.

1463
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:18,080
- You didn't even ask
for a second opinion.

1464
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:23,961
[engine turns over]

1465
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:31,552
- Gracie, I know, sweetheart-
- Good night.

1466
01:21:44,649 --> 01:21:47,484
- Why did you bother to lie?

1467
01:21:53,658 --> 01:21:55,618
- Oh, my God,
you are smoking.

1468
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:57,745
- I'm quitting soon.

1469
01:22:08,590 --> 01:22:12,509
- But I have never
seen you smoke in my whole life.

1470
01:22:12,636 --> 01:22:14,637
- I know.

1471
01:22:27,108 --> 01:22:29,777
Aw.
- [sobs]

1472
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:33,238
- I'm so sorry
this had to happen to you.

1473
01:22:33,365 --> 01:22:37,034
- I'm not crying
because of Daddy.

1474
01:22:39,287 --> 01:22:42,206
I'm crying because...

1475
01:22:42,332 --> 01:22:45,834
I'm so mean to you
all the time,

1476
01:22:45,961 --> 01:22:48,963
and I hate it.

1477
01:22:49,089 --> 01:22:50,339
And I don't want to be.

1478
01:22:50,465 --> 01:22:53,300
I really, really, really don't.

1479
01:22:53,426 --> 01:22:56,428
[crying]

1480
01:22:59,057 --> 01:23:02,726
- Sweetheart,
it's not your fault.

1481
01:23:02,852 --> 01:23:05,145
There's so many things
you don't know about me.

1482
01:23:05,271 --> 01:23:07,773
- No, not yet.

1483
01:23:12,487 --> 01:23:15,531
I want to be your friend,

1484
01:23:15,657 --> 01:23:18,325
because...

1485
01:23:18,451 --> 01:23:22,037
because we still have time.

1486
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:27,418
- I'd be honored
to be your friend.

1487
01:23:27,544 --> 01:23:29,920
- No, not honored.

1488
01:23:30,046 --> 01:23:32,715
Just happy.

1489
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:35,342
- Okay, happy.

1490
01:23:35,468 --> 01:23:38,303
- Mom.

1491
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:51,859
[vehicle approaching]

1492
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:02,911
- I saw your light on.

1493
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,622
I wanted to see
if you needed anything.

1494
01:24:05,749 --> 01:24:08,083
My mom told me what happened.

1495
01:24:08,209 --> 01:24:10,753
- Oh, my son
is at the hospital,

1496
01:24:10,879 --> 01:24:14,465
and I'm supposed to be resting,
but I can't.

1497
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:19,595
- I could drive you around
a little bit.

1498
01:24:19,721 --> 01:24:22,598
Do they have your cell?

1499
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:24,391
- Don't you have work?

1500
01:24:24,517 --> 01:24:28,145
- I'm off till 5:00.

1501
01:24:28,271 --> 01:24:30,689
- I could write Grace a note.

1502
01:24:34,069 --> 01:24:35,611
Okay.

1503
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:52,503
- I'm leaving soon.

1504
01:24:52,629 --> 01:24:54,671
- And where will you go?

1505
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:57,591
- Back out west, I guess.

1506
01:25:04,891 --> 01:25:08,852
What do you pray for
when you pray?

1507
01:25:08,978 --> 01:25:12,564
- For my kids to be happy,
I guess.

1508
01:25:12,690 --> 01:25:15,067
And to be good.

1509
01:25:15,193 --> 01:25:19,863
It sounds so childish,
saying it out loud.

1510
01:25:19,989 --> 01:25:23,992
- Do you want to pray
for your husband?

1511
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:27,246
- It's hopeless.

1512
01:25:27,372 --> 01:25:29,665
His brain is dead.

1513
01:25:29,791 --> 01:25:32,668
- Not for his brain.

1514
01:25:32,794 --> 01:25:35,879
For his soul.

1515
01:25:36,005 --> 01:25:37,506
- I don't know
how to do that.

1516
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:39,466
- Me neither.

1517
01:25:39,592 --> 01:25:41,468
Let's try.

1518
01:27:16,898 --> 01:27:19,900
- [moaning]

1519
01:27:38,086 --> 01:27:41,088
[crying]

1520
01:27:51,808 --> 01:27:53,433
[softly]
Sorry.

1521
01:28:38,354 --> 01:28:41,481
Okay, Herb...

1522
01:28:41,607 --> 01:28:44,318
I'm gonna let you go.

1523
01:28:49,282 --> 01:28:50,866
I'm sure
you're pissed as it is

1524
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:52,534
that I've left you
like this so long,

1525
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:55,579
but we wanted to wait
for Grace.

1526
01:28:58,374 --> 01:29:00,375
[sniffles]

1527
01:29:09,510 --> 01:29:12,346
I love you anyway, you know.

1528
01:29:18,936 --> 01:29:21,855
I'll always love you,
you bastard.

1529
01:29:23,691 --> 01:29:26,068
- Are you ready now?

1530
01:30:27,171 --> 01:30:29,506
- Okay, it's time to turn
the corner.

1531
01:30:29,632 --> 01:30:32,259
I'm going to stay with Ben
and his girlfriend in town.

1532
01:30:32,385 --> 01:30:34,177
I'm gonna find a place
near them,

1533
01:30:34,303 --> 01:30:38,265
and I'm gonna wait
to become a grandmother.

1534
01:30:53,781 --> 01:30:54,656
[gasps]

1535
01:30:54,782 --> 01:30:55,782
[tires screech]

1536
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:40,994
I'm awake.

1537
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:46,208
- I just don't know
if we can get it all to work.

1538
01:31:49,003 --> 01:31:50,837
- Hi, Mama.

1539
01:31:52,340 --> 01:31:54,132
- I'm going on a trip.

1540
01:31:54,258 --> 01:31:55,300
- A trip?

1541
01:31:55,426 --> 01:31:56,635
- Yes,
and I was wondering

1542
01:31:56,761 --> 01:32:00,680
if you could call
these movers right here

1543
01:32:00,806 --> 01:32:02,224
and take whatever you want

1544
01:32:02,350 --> 01:32:04,392
and then tell them
to give the rest to Goodwill.

1545
01:32:04,519 --> 01:32:05,936
That would be great.

1546
01:32:06,062 --> 01:32:07,646
- What about
the memorial service?

1547
01:32:07,772 --> 01:32:08,939
- Right, memorial service-

1548
01:32:09,065 --> 01:32:11,024
just call everybody on here
except for Sandra,

1549
01:32:11,150 --> 01:32:14,152
and just call me on my cell
and give me the date.

1550
01:32:14,278 --> 01:32:16,488
And you know what?
What the hell? Invite Sandra.

1551
01:32:16,614 --> 01:32:19,241
- Mom, are you actually leaving?

1552
01:32:19,367 --> 01:32:20,909
- I'll be back.

1553
01:32:21,035 --> 01:32:22,577
- When?

1554
01:32:22,703 --> 01:32:24,496
- Sweetheart, your father
was in love with a woman

1555
01:32:24,622 --> 01:32:28,041
I cooked for two days a week
over the past four years.

1556
01:32:28,167 --> 01:32:32,170
I'm not going to organize
his memorial service.

1557
01:32:32,296 --> 01:32:35,215
[vehicle approaching]

1558
01:32:35,341 --> 01:32:36,841
- Who is that guy?

1559
01:32:36,968 --> 01:32:38,593
- He's my friend.

1560
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:41,096
- A friend?
What's going on?

1561
01:32:41,222 --> 01:32:43,306
- Ben, I'm not driving off
into the sunset.

1562
01:32:43,432 --> 01:32:46,268
I'm just seeing
what happens next.

1563
01:32:46,394 --> 01:32:48,103
- I can't believe
this is happening.

1564
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:49,437
- She's given us
half her life.

1565
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:52,482
Don't you think
