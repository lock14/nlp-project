1
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,878
<i>I need help!</i>

2
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,963
- I'll go.
- Daddy, Daddy, Daddy.

3
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:12,174
Oh, don't worry, sweetheart.
Dad'll be right back.

4
00:02:12,299 --> 00:02:16,887
Daddy's not leaving, honey. He's just
helping your brother in the bathroom.

5
00:02:16,887 --> 00:02:18,889
It's okay.
Hey, look at that!

6
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:21,099
What's going on?

7
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,727
I'm trying to poop, but I can't.

8
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:26,271
Just relax, David.
Don't work so hard.

9
00:02:26,355 --> 00:02:29,858
But my stomach hurts.
I had to burp, but I need to poop.

10
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,028
Well, sometimes if you just sit there,
a fart will just work its way out.

11
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:35,739
Who said anything about a fart?

12
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:37,908
HoneyI The Terminix guy is finished.

13
00:02:37,908 --> 00:02:41,119
A fart's just as good as a burp, David,
sometimes even better.

14
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:45,123
A fart, a burp or a poop.

15
00:02:45,207 --> 00:02:48,168
- What am I talking about?
- Mr. Ronson -

16
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:50,838
- you have a problem.
- Fantastic.

17
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,799
Here it comes!

18
00:03:01,265 --> 00:03:04,309
I gotta bring these galleys I proofed
into work today.

19
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:06,311
Shouldn't your boss
be proofin' those?

20
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:09,356
Yeah, she should, but she's behind
for maternity leave

21
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:11,358
so I'm covering for her.

22
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:15,028
So much for taking the job
so you can work on your book.

23
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:19,366
Anyway, it would be great
if you could drive me.

24
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:22,202
- Oh, sweetie, I can't. Today is Monday.
- So?

25
00:03:22,202 --> 00:03:25,330
Well, alternate side is in effect,
so I gotta move the car.

26
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,961
- Into another parking spot?
- Yeah.

27
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:36,008
You're not gonna drive me 'cause you have to
park the car on the other side of the street?

28
00:03:36,008 --> 00:03:38,760
Well, you're oversimplifying it now.

29
00:03:38,886 --> 00:03:42,264
How's that? You only use the car
when you need to drive it 10 feet -

30
00:03:42,264 --> 00:03:44,308
- into a legal parking spot.
- If I'm lucky.

31
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:46,602
That doesn't make any sense!

32
00:03:46,602 --> 00:03:49,855
Look, if we're not gonna use it,
will you just sell it?

33
00:03:49,897 --> 00:03:51,857
I like knowing it's there.

34
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,693
Booyah! Bam! Bam!

35
00:03:54,693 --> 00:03:59,031
Right. So if there's an emergency,
we always have a way out of Manhattan.

36
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:02,451
Well, you laugh now,
but that thing is fully equipped.

37
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:05,579
Tobey, you've got two bottles of water
in there and four PowerBars.

38
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:07,581
How far is that gonna get us?

39
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:11,168
The car has special meaning to me.
Can you deal with that?

40
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,213
Why?

41
00:04:15,923 --> 00:04:19,218
Look, if you must know...

42
00:04:20,636 --> 00:04:24,973
the first time I saw you,
I was in that car.

43
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,353
Fine.

44
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,066
I'll take a cab.

45
00:04:36,818 --> 00:04:40,614
- I gotta go.
- All right, baby.

46
00:04:40,614 --> 00:04:43,033
- Later.
- What, are you kiddin'me?

47
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:58,465
Okay, so it sounds like
everything's goin' good.

48
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:00,467
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

49
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,183
I mean, there's still
all the same old issues.

50
00:05:08,183 --> 00:05:11,979
What are those?
What are the same old issues?

51
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,982
- Well, you know, like no sex.
- Well, that's your issue.

52
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,484
- I'd say that's our issue.
- No. I'm just not

53
00:05:17,609 --> 00:05:19,528
a sex maniac like you are.

54
00:05:19,528 --> 00:05:21,572
I'm not a maniac.
I just like it.

55
00:05:21,613 --> 00:05:23,740
Twice a day.

56
00:05:23,866 --> 00:05:26,493
What is that look
supposed to mean?

57
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:29,830
It's not like I'm saying I like to kill
baby squirrels. I like to have sex.

58
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,999
- Always from behind.
- Now, that is a lie.

59
00:05:32,124 --> 00:05:34,418
- That's a lie.
- You know it is not, Tom.

60
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,212
You know, sometimes I would
just like to look at you.

61
00:05:37,212 --> 00:05:40,340
Maybe you'd have more luck if you did
something a little more romantic.

62
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:43,635
The only way to approach you is from behind
because your back's always turned to me.

63
00:05:43,635 --> 00:05:48,515
I'm reading. I just like to have a minute to
myself without you pawing at me all day.

64
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:51,643
Well, forgive me
if I want to touch my wife.

65
00:05:54,855 --> 00:05:59,359
Here's what I think.
I think, if I may say...

66
00:05:59,359 --> 00:06:04,740
we could get a lot more work done
if you'd come in more than once a year.

67
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:09,161
Would you think about it?

68
00:06:09,161 --> 00:06:11,622
- We'll think about it.
- Yeah.

69
00:06:11,705 --> 00:06:15,667
Would you... And, Tom...

70
00:06:17,127 --> 00:06:20,130
listen to Rebecca and don't...
don't paw at her.

71
00:06:20,130 --> 00:06:22,591
And just give her some space, okay?

72
00:06:22,591 --> 00:06:26,261
And Rebecca,
think about having sex with Tom.

73
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:28,514
Possibly doggy style.

74
00:06:30,057 --> 00:06:32,184
Okay?

75
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,355
And I have your cell numbers, right?

76
00:06:36,355 --> 00:06:38,398
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

77
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,278
Therapy always makes me so horny.

78
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:45,531
Did he actually say "doggy style"?

79
00:06:45,572 --> 00:06:47,533
Yeah. I knew I liked that guy.

80
00:06:47,574 --> 00:06:49,618
- I gotta go.
- Mmm. No.

81
00:06:50,911 --> 00:06:53,872
Tom, I have rehearsal.
Don't suck my face off.

82
00:06:53,872 --> 00:06:57,417
Did I tell you I had a dream last night
that you gave me a blow job?

83
00:06:57,417 --> 00:07:00,420
Yeah. I had a dream
that I gave you a German shepherd.

84
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:03,382
Unhand me. And remember,
you're picking up David from school...

85
00:07:03,382 --> 00:07:05,467
and we need milk.

86
00:07:05,592 --> 00:07:08,178
I know. It's my new life...
househusband.

87
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:10,472
Hey, dude.
You asked for it.

88
00:07:12,724 --> 00:07:16,436
Yo, Miss Rollack.
Rebecca. Yo!

89
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:18,856
Come on, Rebecca.
Just give us a couple of pictures!

90
00:07:59,855 --> 00:08:03,525
- Yeah, you leavin'?
- You wish!

91
00:08:03,525 --> 00:08:06,987
Blow me, dickhead!

92
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:40,729
Megan Sweetlander's office. Please hold.

93
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:43,482
Megan Sweetlander's office.
May I help you?

94
00:08:43,482 --> 00:08:45,359
- Hey, it's me.
- Oh, God.

95
00:08:45,359 --> 00:08:48,445
- I'm swamped here.
- Oh, just hang up on them all.

96
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:53,784
I did it.

97
00:08:53,825 --> 00:08:56,245
Oh, my God.
I was kidding!

98
00:08:56,370 --> 00:09:00,332
- Jesus, that felt good.
- Hey, do you think I'm crazy?

99
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,459
Not compared
to other actresses, no.

100
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:05,170
How often do you
and my brother have sex?

101
00:09:05,170 --> 00:09:08,173
Satisfying sex or just sex?

102
00:09:08,173 --> 00:09:11,718
- Oh, say no more.
- I try to, but he won't listen.

103
00:09:13,387 --> 00:09:15,889
You know, we have good...

104
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:19,226
We have good sex.
Sometimes.

105
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:21,687
- Elaine!
- Um, I really gotta go.

106
00:09:21,728 --> 00:09:23,897
Do you ever worry
that Tobey'll cheat on you?

107
00:09:23,897 --> 00:09:26,650
Only with his therapist.
I'm hanging up.

108
00:09:26,650 --> 00:09:31,029
Uh, unfortunately, we do not accept
unsolicited manuscripts.

109
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:33,282
- You never have time for me any...
- Thank you.

110
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:36,159
- Elaine.
- Yes.

111
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:39,746
"A curveball
is the speed of the air...

112
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:41,748
moving fast"

113
00:09:41,748 --> 00:09:44,918
Hey.

114
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:47,504
Hey, I'm just reading your article
on wrist injuries in older pitchers.

115
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:49,506
That's fascinating stuff.

116
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:52,426
Yep. I really blew the lid off
carpal tunnel syndrome.

117
00:09:52,426 --> 00:09:54,386
Well, at least you have a job.

118
00:09:54,386 --> 00:09:57,472
When Rebecca asked what I was doing
this morning, I said "the usual."

119
00:09:57,556 --> 00:10:00,934
You think she knew that meant
breakfast, jerk off, nap, late lunch?

120
00:10:00,934 --> 00:10:03,812
Yeah, well, maybe
I shouldn't have quit advertising.

121
00:10:03,812 --> 00:10:06,940
As I remember, you hated it,
felt empty and hollow...

122
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,193
worthless, void of meaning,
purposeless...

123
00:10:09,318 --> 00:10:11,069
Any of this ring a bell?

124
00:10:11,069 --> 00:10:13,989
It might be better than this.
I'm beginning to feel like a kept boy.

125
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,533
- Only I don't know what I'm being kept for.
- Sex?

126
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:18,660
Sure, if you're up for it.
Rebecca's not.

127
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:20,871
That's weird.
She slept with everyone in high school.

128
00:10:20,871 --> 00:10:23,415
And even when we do have sex...

129
00:10:23,415 --> 00:10:26,043
it's like
she's not adventurous anymore.

130
00:10:26,043 --> 00:10:28,045
Cottage cheese.

131
00:10:28,045 --> 00:10:33,050
It's like she used her sexual adventurousness
to lure me in, and she's just normal.

132
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:36,094
She's just normal.
Mommy's just normal!

133
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:39,056
I guess you hoped it'd be more like
marrying a hooker, huh?

134
00:10:39,056 --> 00:10:41,517
Yeah. Except without
the payment though.

135
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:45,562
Speaking of that, do you have
another word for fish lover?

136
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:48,148
Excuse me, sir.
Can we cut in front of you?

137
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,234
We gotta get home for our nap.

138
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,319
We gotta rush.
We're in a rush.

139
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:55,447
Um... aficionado?

140
00:11:03,455 --> 00:11:05,916
- Do you take milk?
- Oh. I do...

141
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:08,585
but I like to pour it myself.

142
00:11:08,585 --> 00:11:10,712
Oh, yeah.

143
00:11:12,214 --> 00:11:14,800
I just wanted to say
I think you're awesome...

144
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,220
and I feel incredible...

145
00:11:18,303 --> 00:11:20,430
to be able to, you know...

146
00:11:20,430 --> 00:11:23,392
share the stage with you,
Miss Pollack.

147
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:25,519
Rebecca.
What was your name again?

148
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,563
Jasper.

149
00:11:27,563 --> 00:11:30,440
- I had a puppy named Jasper.
- Hi.

150
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:33,235
That's funny,
because my last name is Bernard.

151
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:37,239
- Like Saint Bernard.
- Right.

152
00:11:37,239 --> 00:11:39,324
Like the dog.

153
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,410
- Right.
- Yeah.

154
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,745
Okay. Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

155
00:11:43,871 --> 00:11:46,707
Mmm. Oh!

156
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,042
Careful.

157
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:50,544
My dear.

158
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:53,005
- Do you have a moment?
- Oh, yeah.

159
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:56,758
I know you turned down a film to do this role,
and I do appreciate that.

160
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:59,386
I do, however,
feel the need to remind you...

161
00:11:59,386 --> 00:12:01,889
that this is a play, not a film...

162
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:06,018
and it will require some projection.

163
00:12:06,018 --> 00:12:10,105
- It was just a table read.
- No defenses, okay?

164
00:12:10,105 --> 00:12:12,441
Oh, Jasper!

165
00:12:16,069 --> 00:12:18,572
Dad, I can't reach it. Help me.

166
00:12:18,614 --> 00:12:20,699
Oh, you're close.

167
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:22,951
Reach.

168
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,954
Hey, Mom, I wanna
take home mine too.

169
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:28,165
Okay. Go ahead.

170
00:12:30,792 --> 00:12:32,794
You know you're breaking the rules.

171
00:12:32,794 --> 00:12:34,796
What do you mean?

172
00:12:34,796 --> 00:12:37,549
That stuff's not supposed to go home
till the end of the year.

173
00:12:37,633 --> 00:12:40,886
Well, David
told me he needed-he needed it.

174
00:12:40,886 --> 00:12:43,931
Yeah? You also give him
chocolate for dinner, right?

175
00:12:45,766 --> 00:12:47,809
What are you,
the room monitor or something?

176
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:51,563
No. It's refreshing
to see someone breaking the rules.

177
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:54,566
- You're a rebel.
- Mom, help me!

178
00:12:54,608 --> 00:12:57,236
Okay. Here we go.
I'll help you too, David...

179
00:12:57,236 --> 00:13:00,781
'cause your dad would
leave you standing here all day.

180
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:02,908
- Wow, you're strong!
- Thank you.

181
00:13:06,119 --> 00:13:10,374
If you tell, I'll say you did it,
and they'll believe me.

182
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:14,002
Come on.

183
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:19,132
Come back soon.
Thank you.

184
00:13:20,217 --> 00:13:22,636
So how come only once a year?

185
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:26,098
Well, you don't want to dissect it too much.
It's like a tune-up.

186
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:28,350
If you go regularly,
you just become one of those couples...

187
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:32,020
that disappears
up their own assholes, you know?

188
00:13:32,104 --> 00:13:34,773
As my father used to say.

189
00:13:34,773 --> 00:13:38,110
Thank you for that image
while I'm eating a whole fish.

190
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,112
I don't think fish have assholes.

191
00:13:40,112 --> 00:13:43,740
Boys. No more use of that word
while there's food on the table.

192
00:13:43,782 --> 00:13:45,742
Yeah. They got us.

193
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,828
- How's the play going?
- It's all right.

194
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:50,205
The director's sort of
a pretentious moron.

195
00:13:50,289 --> 00:13:52,249
- That's a drag.
- Hi, Roberto.

196
00:13:52,332 --> 00:13:54,501
<i>Ciao, Miss Pollack.</i>

197
00:13:54,501 --> 00:13:56,920
- And this has got to be...
- Asshole.

198
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,631
my last carbohydrate-heavy
meal for a very long time.

199
00:13:59,631 --> 00:14:02,551
Are you kidding?
You look great.

200
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:04,595
How's the book?

201
00:14:04,595 --> 00:14:06,847
I think I'm done.

202
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:10,851
Wow!
I'm gonna start sending it out to agents.

203
00:14:10,851 --> 00:14:13,228
- Yowsa.
- What?

204
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:15,564
I don't know what makes me think
I know anything about kids.

205
00:14:15,564 --> 00:14:17,608
- No, it's a terrific idea.
- Oh, my God.

206
00:14:17,608 --> 00:14:19,693
- That's Faith Faison.
- That's Faith Faison?

207
00:14:19,818 --> 00:14:22,571
He already wants to know
when they're making it into a movie.

208
00:14:26,241 --> 00:14:28,452
- She sees you.
- What are you doing?

209
00:14:28,452 --> 00:14:30,454
Sometimes you get...

210
00:14:30,454 --> 00:14:32,831
- Tasting the wine.
- something caught in your mouth.

211
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,376
Tobey!

212
00:14:36,376 --> 00:14:40,130
- Faith, wow!
- My God!

213
00:14:40,214 --> 00:14:42,007
How are you?

214
00:14:42,049 --> 00:14:45,260
Oh, my God! I can't believe you're here!

215
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:47,262
Geez! Whoa!

216
00:14:47,262 --> 00:14:50,807
Well, no, I always come here. You're not
gonna find better Northern Italian food...

217
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:53,310
anywhere in the city.

218
00:14:53,393 --> 00:14:56,104
- That's my husband.
- What?

219
00:14:56,104 --> 00:15:00,567
Oh! Well, that's my girlfriend.
Of seven years.

220
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,569
- Oh!
- Elaine.

221
00:15:02,694 --> 00:15:04,488
- Hi.
- Hi. It's nice to meet you.

222
00:15:04,488 --> 00:15:06,490
- Congratulations on getting married.
- Oh, thank you.

223
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:08,534
Are you guys gonna?

224
00:15:08,742 --> 00:15:10,369
What?

225
00:15:11,286 --> 00:15:13,497
We're married.
And it's overrated.

226
00:15:13,497 --> 00:15:16,291
- What?
- Uh-oh!

227
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,878
- Hi-oh!
- I'd better go.

228
00:15:19,878 --> 00:15:22,172
- So great to see you.
- Yeah.

229
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:25,717
- Yeah.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

230
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:29,388
And I hope you don't mind me saying,
but I love your work.

231
00:15:29,388 --> 00:15:31,348
Thank you very much.

232
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:33,642
You hate that, don't you?

233
00:15:33,642 --> 00:15:35,644
Bye-bye.

234
00:15:39,648 --> 00:15:42,609
So, who was that chick?

235
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:45,779
Who?

236
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:49,449
Tobey!
You are the worst.

237
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:52,953
What, Faith? I don't know.
Knew her in college.

238
00:15:52,953 --> 00:15:55,581
- She an old girlfriend?
- No.

239
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,668
- She's pretty.
- Yeah. You see her boyfriend?

240
00:15:59,668 --> 00:16:01,795
I mean, do you have to
work out every day?

241
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:05,841
Did you know, by the way,
that muscle sinks faster in the pool?

242
00:16:05,841 --> 00:16:08,010
He's her husband, actually.

243
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:11,221
Oh. Seems a little young
for that, doesn't she?

244
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:15,142
You're the only one who thinks
you have to be 40 to get married.

245
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:19,313
She probably wanted to do it
before she was completely barren.

246
00:16:19,313 --> 00:16:23,817
Oh! That reminds me.
I taped the, uh, documentary for you...

247
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:25,861
on the Serengeti.

248
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:28,989
Tobey! I said Ferlinghetti.

249
00:16:28,989 --> 00:16:31,658
It was for work.

250
00:16:33,911 --> 00:16:35,913
Oh.

251
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:38,540
Well, hey, come on.
Serengeti's cool. Right?

252
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:41,418
Yeah. It's great.

253
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,930
See? I'm fun.

254
00:16:52,930 --> 00:16:57,392
Mmm. Who knew
lobster cannelloni was an aphrodisiac?

255
00:16:57,392 --> 00:16:59,436
Is that what this is?

256
00:16:59,478 --> 00:17:02,397
No. It's lobster Ponson.

257
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:06,610
You pay Maria when we get home
and then meet me in the bedroom.

258
00:17:06,610 --> 00:17:08,654
Like for sex?

259
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,115
Don't ruin it.

260
00:17:12,115 --> 00:17:14,117
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you.

261
00:17:14,117 --> 00:17:16,119
- The kids were great.
- The kids love you.

262
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,956
- David drew a big picture of baboon...
- That's great.

263
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:21,041
and the little girl.

264
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,085
- You get home safe.
- Thank you very much.

265
00:17:23,085 --> 00:17:25,128
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

266
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,142
I, uh...

267
00:17:39,184 --> 00:17:41,270
I have to go to the bathroom.

268
00:17:42,855 --> 00:17:44,815
I'm gonna get a drink.

269
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:13,028
What the hell? Huh?

270
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:16,156
Oh!

271
00:19:23,664 --> 00:19:26,250
It was my last night of carbs...

272
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:29,002
and I wanted
to take advantage of it.

273
00:19:31,505 --> 00:19:35,175
You know, sometimes it's those
near-death experiences...

274
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:38,679
that make us wanna
participate in life that much more.

275
00:19:40,681 --> 00:19:43,809
I can still kinda
taste the throw up.

276
00:19:45,686 --> 00:19:47,729
Good.

277
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:54,528
Whoa, whoa! Oh!

278
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:57,406
Bouncy, bouncy.
Bouncy, bouncy.

279
00:19:57,406 --> 00:20:01,160
Just one more thing,
then we're gonna go home, okay?

280
00:20:08,167 --> 00:20:11,211
- Is that it?
- Let me get one of those.

281
00:20:12,087 --> 00:20:14,089
- This one?
- No, no, no.

282
00:20:14,173 --> 00:20:17,050
Three down from
Sports World and one to the left.

283
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,011
Uh... this one?

284
00:20:19,052 --> 00:20:22,723
No, no. Your other left.
Diag-Diagonal from there.

285
00:20:22,723 --> 00:20:24,933
Shaved?

286
00:20:26,059 --> 00:20:30,522
Ah, good one.
That's 3.15.

287
00:20:30,522 --> 00:20:32,941
Here. Candy for the baby.

288
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:36,570
- Good man.
- And the candy, one dollar.

289
00:20:39,698 --> 00:20:42,534
No, I-I don't wanna be too hard on him.

290
00:20:42,618 --> 00:20:45,662
It's just that I feel like he's not directed,
and that makes him unhappy.

291
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:48,499
And the more unhappy he gets,
the more desperate he gets.

292
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:51,668
And the more desperate he gets,
the less I wanna have sex with him.

293
00:20:51,668 --> 00:20:55,506
Oh. For Tobey,
desperation is foreplay.

294
00:20:55,506 --> 00:20:58,008
You know, I should probably be...

295
00:20:58,008 --> 00:21:00,177
more attentive.

296
00:21:00,302 --> 00:21:02,221
Or at least permissive.

297
00:21:02,221 --> 00:21:04,765
Do you ever wonder
what your life would be like...

298
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:06,808
if you'd chosen someone different?

299
00:21:06,808 --> 00:21:09,603
Like, okay, I was on the train
the other day.

300
00:21:09,603 --> 00:21:11,647
This guy was sitting across from me.

301
00:21:11,772 --> 00:21:15,817
He was wearing
this big, cozy Vermonty sweater.

302
00:21:15,817 --> 00:21:18,278
Just seemed...

303
00:21:18,278 --> 00:21:21,406
old-fashioned...

304
00:21:21,406 --> 00:21:25,619
like he probably had tons of kids
who climb all over him at bedtime.

305
00:21:25,619 --> 00:21:27,621
They go sledding in the winter.

306
00:21:27,746 --> 00:21:30,958
Pick flowers in the spring.
Kill deer in the fall.

307
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:36,797
No. I just did not expect to want
to have a baby this soon.

308
00:21:37,631 --> 00:21:39,591
A baby?

309
00:21:40,634 --> 00:21:42,636
Oh, I don't know.

310
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:45,597
All of a sudden it just...

311
00:21:45,597 --> 00:21:48,016
feels right.

312
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,018
Honey, you're so young, you know?

313
00:21:50,018 --> 00:21:53,230
And Tobey, he's just like a teenager
with a checking account.

314
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:57,776
Excuse me. These are from
the young man over in the corner.

315
00:21:57,776 --> 00:22:02,906
He wanted you to know
that you are, like... awesome?

316
00:22:03,699 --> 00:22:06,577
- Who is that?
- See ya at rehearsal.

317
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,787
I'll tell ya later.

318
00:22:11,373 --> 00:22:14,293
- That was kinda fun.
- Yeah.

319
00:22:14,334 --> 00:22:16,837
Maybe I should become
a first grade teacher.

320
00:22:16,837 --> 00:22:20,215
Who was that mother
you were talking to?

321
00:22:20,215 --> 00:22:22,259
Who?

322
00:22:23,677 --> 00:22:27,347
Oh, that-that's, uh,
that's Shannon's mom, you know?

323
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:29,474
She's a divorcйe, right?

324
00:22:29,516 --> 00:22:32,603
I don't think
anybody's used that term...

325
00:22:32,603 --> 00:22:34,897
since, like, 1954.

326
00:22:34,897 --> 00:22:37,065
She's pretty.

327
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:39,484
I guess.

328
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:45,824
You know, uh, you do kinda owe me.

329
00:22:45,824 --> 00:22:48,702
- I owe you?
- And I know you're tired.

330
00:22:48,702 --> 00:22:53,081
But I have a way where you don't have to
exert any energy at all.

331
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,587
Do you have to wear your retainer?

332
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:02,049
If that's one of your tapes,
you can forget it.

333
00:23:14,853 --> 00:23:16,980
Okay.

334
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:19,066
Here's how it's gonna go down.

335
00:23:19,066 --> 00:23:21,068
I'm gonna close my eyes...

336
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:23,570
and you have to tell me
everything that's happening on TV.

337
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,656
No way in hell I'm gonna do that.

338
00:23:25,656 --> 00:23:28,951
It's either that or actual sex.
You make the call.

339
00:23:28,951 --> 00:23:31,203
This is erotic for you?

340
00:23:35,082 --> 00:23:37,084
- Okay...
- Oh. No, no, no.

341
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:40,712
Okay. There's some kind
of a credit sequence happening.

342
00:23:40,712 --> 00:23:44,258
Just, uh-it's very simple.
Black on white titles.

343
00:23:44,258 --> 00:23:46,927
Okay, Scorsese.
Save your breath for the good stuff.

344
00:23:46,927 --> 00:23:51,431
Now there's some people
in the worst set design I have ever seen.

345
00:23:51,431 --> 00:23:54,643
- Come on.
- Okay. Um...

346
00:23:54,726 --> 00:23:56,770
Okay, no, here they go.
Here they go.

347
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:59,773
- Wow. Um-yeah, pants are off.
- Mm-hmm.

348
00:23:59,773 --> 00:24:02,609
Dress is off. Penis is hard.
They're starting.

349
00:24:02,609 --> 00:24:05,404
A little less like a list, please.

350
00:24:05,404 --> 00:24:07,698
- Oh, Jesus.
- What?

351
00:24:07,698 --> 00:24:10,701
This guy's dick is green
and kind of crooked.

352
00:24:10,701 --> 00:24:13,537
It's, like, twice the size of yours!

353
00:24:13,537 --> 00:24:16,832
- Another, um-another woman's coming in.
- Yeah?

354
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:18,834
- She is Chinese.
- Nice.

355
00:24:18,834 --> 00:24:20,460
- No. No.
- No?

356
00:24:20,502 --> 00:24:22,504
- Uh, Filipino.
- Okay.

357
00:24:22,629 --> 00:24:27,217
She's hiking up her uniform.
And that is a terrible wax that she has.

358
00:24:27,217 --> 00:24:29,303
It's all irritated.

359
00:24:29,428 --> 00:24:32,097
And-Geez,
what would you call that? Um...

360
00:24:32,097 --> 00:24:34,766
I guess it's a piercing.

361
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:36,852
I really don't know
how to describe it accurately...

362
00:24:36,852 --> 00:24:39,146
but whatever it is,
it's flaring the lens.

363
00:24:47,946 --> 00:24:51,200
- Ho, ho, ho. Cookie, sir?
- No, thank you.

364
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:53,869
- Christmas cookie. Go on, take one.
- Get away from me!

365
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:12,721
Well, the most important thing...

366
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:14,723
is to remain calm.

367
00:25:14,723 --> 00:25:17,309
Honey. Honey.
Calm down.

368
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:21,730
Let's just start again.
Take the cable remote.

369
00:25:21,730 --> 00:25:23,815
The one that says cable.
That's right.

370
00:25:23,815 --> 00:25:26,735
Hit the power button.
What do you see?

371
00:25:26,735 --> 00:25:29,821
Okay. Well, you probably
just changed the channel on the TV.

372
00:25:29,821 --> 00:25:33,784
So get the TV remote.
Not cable, but TV.

373
00:25:35,118 --> 00:25:37,287
That's right. Hit three.

374
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:42,251
Nope. That's impossible.

375
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:46,797
Is the TV plugged in?

376
00:25:46,797 --> 00:25:51,301
I would like to have
electronic freedom. Um...

377
00:25:51,343 --> 00:25:56,306
You must have a VCR and a cable box.

378
00:25:57,391 --> 00:26:00,310
Does... your wife...

379
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:03,438
have this much trouble?

380
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:06,191
Let's not go there again,
shall we, Tobey?

381
00:26:06,191 --> 00:26:09,862
Why is it so important for you to know
about my personal life? Hmm?

382
00:26:09,903 --> 00:26:12,948
Let's keep this about you.

383
00:26:12,948 --> 00:26:17,494
Um... you haven't
mentioned death today.

384
00:26:17,536 --> 00:26:19,997
There-There is a phrase...

385
00:26:19,997 --> 00:26:25,127
that you've uttered in, um, yes,
in every session, mm-hmm, so far.

386
00:26:25,127 --> 00:26:29,423
"I mean, we're all going to die.

387
00:26:29,423 --> 00:26:32,176
Doesn't that freak you out?"

388
00:26:34,511 --> 00:26:36,513
And you never answer me.

389
00:26:36,513 --> 00:26:40,058
Actually, it does seem to me...

390
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:44,771
that this whole kind of
television-TiVo tangent thing...

391
00:26:44,771 --> 00:26:46,565
is really an elaborate avoidance...

392
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:48,984
for what's really going on.

393
00:26:53,947 --> 00:26:56,450
And... what's really going on?

394
00:26:58,452 --> 00:27:00,537
You tell me.

395
00:27:01,997 --> 00:27:04,958
Come on, baby! Come on, baby!

396
00:27:04,958 --> 00:27:08,295
Oh! Oh, my God!

397
00:27:15,469 --> 00:27:17,471
That was...

398
00:27:17,471 --> 00:27:20,140
That was good.

399
00:27:22,142 --> 00:27:25,437
I mean, the candles and the whole...

400
00:27:25,437 --> 00:27:27,814
lighting design in general.

401
00:27:27,814 --> 00:27:30,817
- Thank you.
- That was some setup.

402
00:27:32,152 --> 00:27:34,154
- Yeah.
- You...

403
00:27:34,154 --> 00:27:38,617
You were like, um,
that guy from the Yankees.

404
00:27:40,661 --> 00:27:45,249
That one. That, um-that pitcher
that they bring in at the end.

405
00:27:45,249 --> 00:27:47,543
- Mariano Rivera, the closer?
- Yeah.

406
00:27:47,543 --> 00:27:50,128
Huh. Huh. Heh.

407
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:52,464
He always looks so confident...

408
00:27:52,464 --> 00:27:54,800
like he's gonna do
whatever it takes.

409
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,344
You know, he almost never
loses a game.

410
00:27:57,344 --> 00:28:00,556
I bet he's got a really big family.

411
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:03,058
- No.
- Oh, I love...

412
00:28:03,058 --> 00:28:07,187
those big Spanish families,
you know?

413
00:28:07,187 --> 00:28:11,149
You know, they've got lots
and lots of kids.

414
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:14,653
Well, they're Catholic.
They're not allowed to use birth control.

415
00:28:14,653 --> 00:28:16,822
That's not what I'm talking about.

416
00:28:16,864 --> 00:28:19,950
I'm talking about...

417
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:23,620
valuing cultural reproduction.

418
00:28:25,581 --> 00:28:28,625
Well, maybe if they
valued cultural reproduction a little less...

419
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:32,379
we wouldn't be in the middle
of a population explosion...

420
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:36,466
that's running the risk
of using up all our natural resources.

421
00:28:36,466 --> 00:28:38,760
I know you don't think that.

422
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:43,640
I do?

423
00:28:49,521 --> 00:28:51,773
Do you believe in fate?

424
00:28:51,899 --> 00:28:56,528
I'm not talking about the fact
that we're all fated to death...

425
00:28:56,528 --> 00:28:59,448
but the fact that there are some things
that are meant to happen...

426
00:28:59,448 --> 00:29:02,701
and some things
that are not meant to happen.

427
00:29:02,701 --> 00:29:05,787
I have... no idea.

428
00:29:06,747 --> 00:29:08,749
You don't, do you?

429
00:29:18,967 --> 00:29:22,846
Ponson, Ponson, Ponson,
Hirsch, Jacoby and Ponson.

430
00:29:22,888 --> 00:29:26,391
What's another kind of flower
you can get a woman other than a rose?

431
00:29:26,391 --> 00:29:28,477
- What about an orchid?
- You kidding?

432
00:29:28,519 --> 00:29:32,564
- That's even more expensive.
- Well, it must be an important occasion.

433
00:29:32,606 --> 00:29:36,068
Just trying not to get
kicked out of my house.

434
00:29:36,068 --> 00:29:39,071
You could go down to Central Park
and pull up something for free.

435
00:29:39,071 --> 00:29:42,658
That's not a bad idea.
But I'd have to wrap it myself.

436
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:45,410
Elaine is not going to
kick you out of the house.

437
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,288
- She mentioned fate.
- Uh-oh.

438
00:29:48,288 --> 00:29:50,207
I'd spring for the orchid.

439
00:29:50,207 --> 00:29:52,125
What kind of porn you looking at?

440
00:29:52,251 --> 00:29:54,711
Good old-fashioned
man-woman, woman-horse stuff.

441
00:29:54,711 --> 00:29:56,713
- You're such a purist.
- I am.

442
00:29:56,713 --> 00:29:59,758
I thought you were supposed to become
less horny when you turned 40.

443
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,469
- What?
- You can't give a woman berries, can you?

444
00:30:02,469 --> 00:30:05,305
- Oh, I've taken a wrong turn somewhere.
- Ooh, I've gotta go.

445
00:30:05,305 --> 00:30:08,767
I think I found
the flowers I want. Hi-oh!

446
00:30:08,809 --> 00:30:10,811
- Hello?
- What kinda sale we talkin' about?

447
00:30:13,856 --> 00:30:16,483
How did I get in here?

448
00:30:16,608 --> 00:30:18,610
I'm gonna throw it to you next.

449
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:21,196
- Good throw.
- Me! Me! Mr. Ponson!

450
00:30:21,196 --> 00:30:24,950
Mr. Ronson, throw it to me!
Throw it to me!

451
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:26,910
Hold on.

452
00:30:26,994 --> 00:30:28,996
I'm gonna throw one to Liam.

453
00:30:28,996 --> 00:30:31,039
- That was like fishing.
- Hey.

454
00:30:33,167 --> 00:30:35,169
The rebel without a cause.

455
00:30:35,294 --> 00:30:37,838
- Hey.
- Sorry, Mr. Ronson.

456
00:30:37,838 --> 00:30:41,258
- Nice catch.
- Hi.

457
00:30:41,341 --> 00:30:44,511
Uh, listen. The kids and I,
we're going up to Serendipity...

458
00:30:44,511 --> 00:30:47,639
to celebrate the anniversary
of their father leaving us.

459
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:50,142
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hi, honey.

460
00:30:50,142 --> 00:30:53,395
Do you guys wanna come along?

461
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:59,151
- Wait. So you wrote that?
- Uh-huh.

462
00:30:59,151 --> 00:31:01,236
- I love that commercial.
- Well...

463
00:31:01,361 --> 00:31:04,907
"Got milk?" God, it just cuts
through all the bullshit.

464
00:31:04,907 --> 00:31:06,992
It's-It's inspired.

465
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:11,497
Well, I wouldn't say it's inspired.
It's just simple.

466
00:31:11,497 --> 00:31:14,500
So what did you do, like take time off
to write a book or something?

467
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:17,836
Uh, no. Not exactly.

468
00:31:17,878 --> 00:31:21,256
- I've thought about that, but...
- Oh, you should. You'd be great.

469
00:31:21,256 --> 00:31:23,675
Really. I have a sense
about these things.

470
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:25,677
Here.

471
00:31:27,763 --> 00:31:30,474
Yep.

472
00:31:30,474 --> 00:31:34,520
Author. Definitely.

473
00:31:34,561 --> 00:31:36,647
You see that there?

474
00:31:36,647 --> 00:31:38,649
Yeah, I do.

475
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:42,778
"Surrounded by friends,
she was happy and snug.

476
00:31:42,778 --> 00:31:44,988
"She smiled to herself and said...

477
00:31:45,030 --> 00:31:49,701
'Maybe life in the big
city isn't that bad after all. '

478
00:31:49,701 --> 00:31:52,079
The end."

479
00:31:55,457 --> 00:31:59,795
It would be crazy
not to publish this immediately.

480
00:31:59,795 --> 00:32:02,089
It's very timely.

481
00:32:02,214 --> 00:32:05,050
It's about a little girl
battling a dragon.

482
00:32:06,093 --> 00:32:08,345
Right, but with
women's lib and all...

483
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:10,681
You see my point.

484
00:32:13,016 --> 00:32:16,395
Oh, my God!
I hope they like it!

485
00:32:16,395 --> 00:32:18,480
They're gonna love it.

486
00:32:20,691 --> 00:32:24,278
- There's one thing.
- Oh, Tobey, come on. The book is finished.

487
00:32:24,403 --> 00:32:27,573
Please, I ca-I can't make
any more changes in it.

488
00:32:27,573 --> 00:32:31,076
Hey, it's not about
the content of the book, okay?

489
00:32:32,202 --> 00:32:34,329
It's about the presentation.

490
00:32:34,329 --> 00:32:36,373
- Okay.
- Okay?

491
00:32:37,833 --> 00:32:39,960
- Okay.
- This picture?

492
00:32:41,128 --> 00:32:43,380
Just seems so goody-good.

493
00:32:46,592 --> 00:32:50,137
- Well, it is a children's book.
- Right. I know that.

494
00:32:50,137 --> 00:32:53,098
But the people
who publish it aren't children.

495
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:55,309
This is, you know, just...

496
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:58,687
it's just slightly annoying,
you know?

497
00:32:58,687 --> 00:33:00,731
Show some cleavage.

498
00:33:00,772 --> 00:33:04,902
You actually think
I should show... cleavage?

499
00:33:04,902 --> 00:33:07,321
Mmm. Yes, I d...

500
00:33:10,491 --> 00:33:12,743
That's what I'm talkin' about.

501
00:33:12,826 --> 00:33:16,663
- Are you crazy?
- What? Kids, they love the beach.

502
00:33:16,663 --> 00:33:19,500
And this shows them that you're fun.

503
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:21,627
Don't underestimate that.

504
00:33:21,668 --> 00:33:23,795
Wait a second.

505
00:33:27,716 --> 00:33:32,221
You don't...
You don't think it's a little...

506
00:33:32,221 --> 00:33:34,223
too much?

507
00:33:34,223 --> 00:33:36,850
I wanna pay attention to that girl.

508
00:33:39,353 --> 00:33:41,313
Standing at 3 foot 7...

509
00:33:41,313 --> 00:33:43,690
weighing in at 47 pounds
of strapping lefty...

510
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:45,943
digs in.

511
00:33:45,943 --> 00:33:49,863
- Got a hold of that!
- That's a home run!

512
00:33:49,905 --> 00:33:51,949
- Yep. Touch 'em all.
- Hello!

513
00:33:51,949 --> 00:33:54,743
What's goin' on?

514
00:33:54,868 --> 00:33:57,329
Just a little thing
that we like to call spoonball!

515
00:33:57,329 --> 00:33:59,998
Oh. Okay.
Well, Mommy's home.

516
00:33:59,998 --> 00:34:02,668
Spoonball is over
before someone gets hurt.

517
00:34:02,668 --> 00:34:05,254
Aw, come on, Mom.

518
00:34:05,337 --> 00:34:08,382
Yeah, come on, Mom.
It's the bottom of the ninth!

519
00:34:08,382 --> 00:34:10,384
We should be having boy time...

520
00:34:10,384 --> 00:34:13,053
because my dad
made me have girl time.

521
00:34:13,053 --> 00:34:16,306
- What do you mean, honey?
- Dad made me have a play date -

522
00:34:16,306 --> 00:34:20,519
- with Shannon from my class.
- Really?

523
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:23,397
Nobody made you do anything, David.

524
00:34:23,397 --> 00:34:25,816
- They invited us to Serendipity.
- Oh, really? They?

525
00:34:25,816 --> 00:34:29,570
- Come on, Dad. Ritch it!
- Yep. Okay.

526
00:34:32,364 --> 00:34:34,449
Ow! Oh!

527
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:37,077
- Ah-ah.
- Oh, my-Tom!

528
00:34:37,077 --> 00:34:39,288
- Goddamn it!
- Let me see.

529
00:34:43,333 --> 00:34:45,335
Dude, you only get one.

530
00:34:45,377 --> 00:34:48,589
This is a complicated one.
I gotta get the wording right.

531
00:34:48,589 --> 00:34:50,674
Got it.

532
00:34:50,716 --> 00:34:53,010
- Yea.
- Yea. I gotta hit the head.

533
00:34:57,014 --> 00:34:59,975
Please don't ask her anything
inappropriate in front of me.

534
00:34:59,975 --> 00:35:02,019
I can ask her whatever I want.

535
00:35:02,102 --> 00:35:05,189
For such a closed-off person,
it's like you have no boundaries.

536
00:35:05,189 --> 00:35:08,275
It's better than living surrounded
by the Great Wall of China.

537
00:35:08,275 --> 00:35:10,319
What does that mean?

538
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:13,238
- You know what that means?
- Mm-hmm.

539
00:35:13,238 --> 00:35:16,533
- It means you're closed off.
- Like a Chinese person?

540
00:35:16,617 --> 00:35:19,620
No, Tom. It means you like to talk,
but about nothing important...

541
00:35:19,620 --> 00:35:23,582
so then whenever your emotion or resentment
or whatever dark stuff you have builds up -

542
00:35:23,624 --> 00:35:26,293
- you throw a spoon at me.
- I didn't throw the spoon.

543
00:35:26,293 --> 00:35:32,090
- David threw the spoon.
- We've a minute to talk before he gets back.

544
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:34,635
So, um, anything come up?

545
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:36,845
Did he say anything at all?

546
00:35:36,845 --> 00:35:38,805
- No. He's been really busy.
- Busy? Tobey, busy?

547
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:41,141
Stay out of it.

548
00:35:41,266 --> 00:35:45,270
It's fine! It's just our lifestyle
these days.

549
00:35:45,270 --> 00:35:47,648
I mean, it's not just our lifestyle.

550
00:35:47,648 --> 00:35:50,442
It's our whole society's
lifestyle, you know?

551
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:53,195
I mean, there are
a lot of people who are...

552
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:56,949
tethered by an old-fashioned
sense of love...

553
00:35:56,949 --> 00:35:59,368
and, uh, family...

554
00:35:59,368 --> 00:36:03,163
and sometimes I look at them
and I wonder...

555
00:36:03,163 --> 00:36:05,374
if living such a simple life...

556
00:36:05,374 --> 00:36:07,376
can actually be
completely gratifying...

557
00:36:07,501 --> 00:36:13,382
and if they understand
how rich and fertile...

558
00:36:13,382 --> 00:36:15,342
living in the gray area is.

559
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:18,720
I mean, because
it's all really about being happy.

560
00:36:18,804 --> 00:36:21,306
- Right?
- Honey...

561
00:36:21,306 --> 00:36:24,560
No. Do I wish that there was
a little bit more romance? Yes.

562
00:36:24,643 --> 00:36:26,728
Of course I do.
But it's an ebb, a flow.

563
00:36:26,728 --> 00:36:30,107
It's shifting,
and I'm on that journey.

564
00:36:30,107 --> 00:36:32,484
- What'd I miss?
- That's all there is to it.

565
00:36:39,032 --> 00:36:41,243
Honey.

566
00:36:41,368 --> 00:36:43,579
Looks like I finally
digested that corn.

567
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:50,502
What?

568
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:59,386
- How much further?
- Just one more block.

569
00:37:02,723 --> 00:37:04,725
Come on.
We're close.

570
00:37:07,853 --> 00:37:09,855
Why'd you park so far away?

571
00:37:09,855 --> 00:37:12,482
This is the only
legal spot after 11:00.

572
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:14,485
What the fuck?

573
00:37:14,485 --> 00:37:16,570
My car is gone!

574
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:21,533
It was right here!

575
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:23,702
Well...

576
00:37:25,954 --> 00:37:27,998
They probably towed it.

577
00:37:30,459 --> 00:37:33,462
Can we just get a cab?
I'm freezing.

578
00:37:33,462 --> 00:37:35,881
But this is a legal spot!

579
00:37:35,964 --> 00:37:39,009
They didn't tow this guy's car!
Oh, I swear to God...

580
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:41,720
Tobey, would you shut up?

581
00:37:41,720 --> 00:37:43,764
Please!

582
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,854
All right. It's-It's...
It's okay, Elaine.

583
00:37:50,854 --> 00:37:54,525
They just tow it to the pound.

584
00:37:54,608 --> 00:37:56,652
We can get it out.

585
00:38:00,113 --> 00:38:04,827
I want to get married
and have a baby!

586
00:38:06,161 --> 00:38:08,705
And you don't.

587
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:13,210
Okay. Let's just get a cab.

588
00:38:13,293 --> 00:38:15,963
Oh, sh-I have wasted...

589
00:38:15,963 --> 00:38:19,007
seven years of my life with you!

590
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:21,635
Oh, shit.

591
00:38:25,764 --> 00:38:28,308
I need... you...

592
00:38:28,308 --> 00:38:31,436
to find somewhere else
to stay tonight.

593
00:38:38,152 --> 00:38:40,279
Hey!

594
00:39:02,092 --> 00:39:04,136
Hello?

595
00:39:05,721 --> 00:39:07,723
Honey-Honey, what is it?

596
00:39:07,723 --> 00:39:09,933
What happened?

597
00:39:09,975 --> 00:39:12,269
Aw, sweetie.

598
00:39:12,269 --> 00:39:14,271
He did?

599
00:39:16,607 --> 00:39:18,942
Oh, that fucking car!

600
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:24,448
Hey, what's going on? Rebecca's on
the other line with her right now.

601
00:39:24,448 --> 00:39:26,492
Hi, Tom.

602
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:29,578
- Pamela?
- I hope I'm not getting you at a bad time.

603
00:39:29,578 --> 00:39:33,040
Um, no, no. I was just, uh,
relieving myself.

604
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:35,209
- What?
- I mean, uh...

605
00:39:35,250 --> 00:39:37,294
Hello?

606
00:39:37,336 --> 00:39:40,672
I mean I-I'm just...
I'm-I'm relieved that it's you.

607
00:39:40,672 --> 00:39:42,716
Good.

608
00:40:43,277 --> 00:40:45,279
Come in.

609
00:40:45,279 --> 00:40:47,281
- Hey.
- Hi.

610
00:40:47,322 --> 00:40:49,324
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah.

611
00:40:49,324 --> 00:40:52,244
- You look a little tense.
- Oh. You think?

612
00:41:02,713 --> 00:41:04,715
Whoa.

613
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:07,301
Yeah. I guess I am a little tense.

614
00:41:07,301 --> 00:41:09,678
Yeah. Let me just...

615
00:41:12,556 --> 00:41:15,684
You're strong.

616
00:41:41,376 --> 00:41:43,420
Have you ever had a, uh...

617
00:41:45,464 --> 00:41:48,467
ever had a problem,
you know...

618
00:41:48,467 --> 00:41:52,804
I guess you haven't been listening to me
for the last 15 years.

619
00:41:52,804 --> 00:41:56,099
No, like-like...
like another woman problem.

620
00:41:56,183 --> 00:41:58,310
Issue.

621
00:41:58,352 --> 00:42:01,313
What, do you have one?

622
00:42:01,313 --> 00:42:05,025
- Tom?
- Please don't say anything.

623
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:08,278
- I'm not sure what's going on...
- Hey!

624
00:42:08,278 --> 00:42:10,280
- Hi!
- Hey!

625
00:42:10,364 --> 00:42:12,449
Hey. Hi. Oh!

626
00:42:12,449 --> 00:42:14,743
You're the last person
I expect to see.

627
00:42:14,827 --> 00:42:16,578
Yeah, well.
Here I am.

628
00:42:16,662 --> 00:42:18,539
Eating soup.

629
00:42:18,539 --> 00:42:20,541
Yeah.

630
00:42:20,541 --> 00:42:23,377
- Yeah. You remember Tom?
- Hi.

631
00:42:24,628 --> 00:42:27,923
Are you okay? You look tired.

632
00:42:28,006 --> 00:42:30,884
Uh, well, actually, um...

633
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:32,928
Elaine and I split up...

634
00:42:32,928 --> 00:42:35,055
about, uh-about three weeks ago.

635
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:37,057
Oh, God. I'm sorry.

636
00:42:37,057 --> 00:42:39,059
Yeah, well, it was
a long relationship...

637
00:42:39,101 --> 00:42:41,061
- You know what? I'm gonna go.
- Okay.

638
00:42:41,061 --> 00:42:44,022
Oh, wait. I thought we were
gonna go see a movie together.

639
00:42:44,022 --> 00:42:46,900
- I gotta check something out.
- Hey.

640
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,861
- Watch where you're going, asshole.
- Sorry.

641
00:42:48,902 --> 00:42:50,946
- Shit!
- Honey! Honey, look who's here.

642
00:42:50,946 --> 00:42:53,490
Did you see this prick
that just knocked into me?

643
00:42:53,490 --> 00:42:56,577
- I should have smacked him upside the head.
- No. No, don't do that.

644
00:42:56,577 --> 00:43:00,164
- Honey, remember Tobey?
- Hey.

645
00:43:00,164 --> 00:43:02,166
- What's up, bro?
- Hey. Oh!

646
00:43:02,207 --> 00:43:04,960
- All right.
- Oh!

647
00:43:06,587 --> 00:43:09,715
Paper covers rock.
Remember that?

648
00:43:09,715 --> 00:43:11,675
Hey, do you like music?

649
00:43:11,800 --> 00:43:14,636
You know? 'Cause Rand
is promoting this great new club...

650
00:43:14,636 --> 00:43:16,638
and it's really-it's really hot.

651
00:43:16,638 --> 00:43:18,640
- Yeah. You know.
- Oh!

652
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,642
Oh, well, I'd love to.

653
00:43:20,642 --> 00:43:23,478
- I mean, if that's an invitation.
- Absolutely!

654
00:43:23,478 --> 00:43:26,148
- Yes. I just need an e-mail address.
- I... come... clubbing.

655
00:43:27,232 --> 00:43:30,736
Uh... yeah.

656
00:43:30,736 --> 00:43:33,363
It's...

657
00:43:33,363 --> 00:43:35,741
A-S...

658
00:43:35,782 --> 00:43:38,285
S-M...

659
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:40,370
A-N-2...

660
00:43:40,412 --> 00:43:44,833
- 0-4 at AOL.com.
- Okay.

661
00:43:46,668 --> 00:43:48,712
Got it.

662
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:51,798
One through 203 were taken.

663
00:43:51,798 --> 00:43:55,552
Okay. Well, I will
e-mail you the details then.

664
00:43:55,552 --> 00:43:58,305
- All right. My man.
- Assman.

665
00:43:58,305 --> 00:44:00,891
- Bye.
- Okay.

666
00:44:12,152 --> 00:44:14,238
- Hi. Are you...
- Norah.

667
00:44:14,238 --> 00:44:17,115
Norah? Wow! Hi.
I'm so sorry I'm late.

668
00:44:17,199 --> 00:44:20,494
I was afraid that they
weren't gonna let you sit down.

669
00:44:20,494 --> 00:44:25,123
Oh, it was difficult,
but I finally managed to persuade them.

670
00:44:27,125 --> 00:44:29,294
I never imagined
when I submitted my book...

671
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:33,257
that it would elicit a response
from the head of the company.

672
00:44:33,257 --> 00:44:35,926
I'm grateful you agreed to see me,
actually.

673
00:44:35,926 --> 00:44:39,763
Are you kidding?
Do you know who you are?

674
00:44:39,847 --> 00:44:41,849
I think so.

675
00:44:41,849 --> 00:44:44,101
I'm sorry.
That was-that was crass.

676
00:44:44,226 --> 00:44:46,812
I just got out of a relationship
with a crass man...

677
00:44:46,812 --> 00:44:50,649
nothing to do with gardening.

678
00:44:50,691 --> 00:44:52,651
Anyway, I don't know.
I say these things.

679
00:44:52,651 --> 00:44:55,946
I don't know where they come from.

680
00:44:56,029 --> 00:44:58,866
Excuse me.

681
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:00,868
- I'm so sorry.
- Are you okay?

682
00:45:00,868 --> 00:45:03,120
I'm fine.
Are you okay? Jesus.

683
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:05,956
I'm fine. I'm just wet.
You're choking.

684
00:45:06,999 --> 00:45:09,126
No, because I called.

685
00:45:09,168 --> 00:45:11,628
Because I left a message for you.

686
00:45:11,628 --> 00:45:15,048
Would you...
Would you just fuck you for just a...

687
00:45:15,048 --> 00:45:17,134
I'm sorry.
Look, I'm really sorry.

688
00:45:17,134 --> 00:45:19,136
Excuse me. I-I...

689
00:45:19,136 --> 00:45:23,974
Yeah. No, I'm fine.
No, you know, I'm a little tense today.

690
00:45:23,974 --> 00:45:27,227
Susie, you know I...
I love talking to you...

691
00:45:27,227 --> 00:45:32,191
but I don't think
that on my cell phone right now is...

692
00:45:32,191 --> 00:45:34,610
She's horrible.

693
00:45:34,735 --> 00:45:37,613
She called me this morning,
and she's screaming at me.

694
00:45:37,613 --> 00:45:40,657
I'm really in very bad shape.
Basically I'm exhausted.

695
00:45:40,657 --> 00:45:43,577
The bank is calling me all the time,
and the contractor called twice.

696
00:45:43,577 --> 00:45:45,829
I don't know what the fuck
I'm doing here.

697
00:45:45,954 --> 00:45:47,998
Really, really difficult day.

698
00:45:47,998 --> 00:45:50,125
The lady who lives upstairs
from me...

699
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:52,920
that horrible bitch
I'm always fighting with?

700
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:02,387
Douche bag!

701
00:46:05,265 --> 00:46:09,937
I want to start off this meeting
by first thanking Sensei Goldberg...

702
00:46:09,937 --> 00:46:11,980
for the use of his dojo.

703
00:46:13,941 --> 00:46:17,986
I would like to also welcome the sensei
as our newest member...

704
00:46:17,986 --> 00:46:21,281
of the Broadway division
of Sex Addicts R' Us.

705
00:46:21,323 --> 00:46:24,576
So that means if you are here...

706
00:46:24,576 --> 00:46:29,122
for the previously scheduled seminar on
owning your orgasm, you're in the wrong place.

707
00:46:29,122 --> 00:46:31,625
Shit.

708
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:35,921
It's been moved to the basement
of Our Lady of Poland on 34th street.

709
00:46:35,921 --> 00:46:37,965
- Thirty fourth?
- Yeah.

710
00:46:39,466 --> 00:46:41,802
Are you here for the meeting?

711
00:46:41,802 --> 00:46:44,721
What? The meeting?

712
00:46:44,805 --> 00:46:46,557
Yes. The meeting?

713
00:46:46,557 --> 00:46:50,602
Yeah. The meeting. Yeah. I thought...
I thought I'd check it out.

714
00:46:50,602 --> 00:46:54,189
Welcome. Your name?

715
00:46:55,649 --> 00:46:59,153
- Tobey.
- Hi, Tobey.

716
00:46:59,153 --> 00:47:01,697
Well, my friend Rebecca says...

717
00:47:01,697 --> 00:47:05,284
she thinks that men
are never really ready to have a baby...

718
00:47:05,284 --> 00:47:08,120
and that you have to trap them.

719
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:10,080
What do you think?

720
00:47:10,122 --> 00:47:12,124
I don't really think about it.

721
00:47:12,166 --> 00:47:16,503
But I certainly think you shouldn't be
spending your energy trying to trap a man.

722
00:47:16,503 --> 00:47:18,547
You're way too talented.

723
00:47:18,589 --> 00:47:21,633
I believe in fate.

724
00:47:21,633 --> 00:47:24,595
I think you're meant
to have this time, Elaine.

725
00:47:24,595 --> 00:47:27,764
You're meant to-to explore.

726
00:47:29,266 --> 00:47:32,019
Sounds like you need it.

727
00:47:32,019 --> 00:47:34,104
I don't know what I need.

728
00:47:34,104 --> 00:47:37,691
Well, I think you know more
than you're willing to admit.

729
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:39,735
This is me.

730
00:47:39,735 --> 00:47:42,070
Oh. Sweet.

731
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:45,449
Thank you so much for lunch
and for the walk.

732
00:47:45,532 --> 00:47:48,994
It was delicious, don't you think?

733
00:47:48,994 --> 00:47:51,955
Yes.

734
00:47:51,955 --> 00:47:53,957
So do you think that
there's any chance...

735
00:47:53,957 --> 00:47:56,585
you're gonna publish my book?

736
00:47:58,253 --> 00:48:01,381
You know, Elaine,
you're a very talented young woman...

737
00:48:01,381 --> 00:48:03,383
and, quite frankly...

738
00:48:03,383 --> 00:48:06,970
I was very taken with the photo
you sent with your submission.

739
00:48:06,970 --> 00:48:10,974
- Mm-hmm.
- But I want to be honest with you.

740
00:48:11,016 --> 00:48:13,894
I don't like to rush these things.

741
00:48:13,894 --> 00:48:16,605
- I like to go slow.
- Okay.

742
00:48:16,605 --> 00:48:20,526
So let's meet and see how it goes.

743
00:48:20,526 --> 00:48:22,611
Okay.

744
00:48:24,321 --> 00:48:26,406
Ah, get a room.

745
00:48:26,406 --> 00:48:28,492
It was never enough.

746
00:48:29,701 --> 00:48:32,162
No matter how many times...

747
00:48:32,162 --> 00:48:34,832
different positions...

748
00:48:34,832 --> 00:48:37,835
none of it made me feel whole.

749
00:48:37,835 --> 00:48:40,963
In fact, it just made me
feel empty.

750
00:48:46,552 --> 00:48:48,512
How's the sandwich?

751
00:48:48,554 --> 00:48:52,099
Okay, so... just a recap.

752
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:55,102
Uh, John is not happy...

753
00:48:55,102 --> 00:48:58,605
unless he can fit his penis
inside a hard, inanimate object.

754
00:48:58,605 --> 00:49:00,566
Preferably coarse.

755
00:49:00,566 --> 00:49:05,237
Right. Sarah, you had
a relapse this week...

756
00:49:05,237 --> 00:49:08,157
again putting yourself in danger
with a power tool.

757
00:49:08,157 --> 00:49:10,784
And, uh, Gordon...

758
00:49:10,784 --> 00:49:13,745
the sex you are having
with your wife's mother...

759
00:49:13,829 --> 00:49:19,001
and your wife's mother's sister
is putting your homelife in major jeopardy.

760
00:49:19,001 --> 00:49:22,880
That leaves...
Tobey.

761
00:49:25,048 --> 00:49:28,051
- I'll pass.
- Great. Sandwich guy's gonna pass?

762
00:49:28,093 --> 00:49:30,929
Great. Very trusting.

763
00:49:30,929 --> 00:49:34,308
It's traditional
that everyone shares.

764
00:49:44,193 --> 00:49:46,278
Well...

765
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,739
I've been having an affair.

766
00:49:54,495 --> 00:49:56,622
With a woman...

767
00:49:59,124 --> 00:50:01,210
who is not my wife.

768
00:50:06,548 --> 00:50:08,717
And, um,

769
00:50:08,717 --> 00:50:11,011
I, uh...

770
00:50:13,138 --> 00:50:17,851
I like her to wrap me in deli meats.

771
00:50:20,062 --> 00:50:23,357
I need her
to wrap me in deli meats...

772
00:50:23,357 --> 00:50:25,943
in order to achieve an orgasm.

773
00:50:28,862 --> 00:50:30,906
Usually ham.

774
00:50:31,865 --> 00:50:33,909
Thinly sliced.

775
00:50:36,203 --> 00:50:39,498
I know it's not normal.

776
00:50:39,498 --> 00:50:42,751
No one here knows
what that word means, Tobey.

777
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:45,712
You're amongst friends.

778
00:50:45,712 --> 00:50:47,589
Continue.

779
00:50:47,589 --> 00:50:50,676
And hand me the sandwich.

780
00:50:50,676 --> 00:50:52,845
Am I allowed to wear fur?

781
00:50:52,886 --> 00:50:55,597
Do I, like, give off that vibe?

782
00:50:55,597 --> 00:50:57,808
- Is she attractive?
- So funny.

783
00:50:57,808 --> 00:51:01,436
Afterwards, all I wanted to do
was tell Tobey.

784
00:51:01,436 --> 00:51:04,523
He would have died of excitement...
a possible threesome.

785
00:51:04,565 --> 00:51:06,608
I had a threesome once.

786
00:51:06,608 --> 00:51:09,444
It was with two guys
who turned out to be gay.

787
00:51:09,528 --> 00:51:11,488
I was just kind of
the window dressing.

788
00:51:11,530 --> 00:51:13,949
It all made sense in retrospect...

789
00:51:14,032 --> 00:51:16,910
but I can't tell you
what it did for my self-esteem.

790
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:19,329
Yeah. It seems really damaged.

791
00:51:19,413 --> 00:51:23,292
- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

792
00:51:23,292 --> 00:51:25,294
You know, I don't get
what people think of me...

793
00:51:25,294 --> 00:51:27,296
that I have no
problems or feelings...

794
00:51:27,296 --> 00:51:29,590
I'm perfect, I'm like a robot?

795
00:51:29,715 --> 00:51:32,259
No, honey.
Nobody thinks that.

796
00:51:32,259 --> 00:51:36,388
We all think you're great.
We all have problems.

797
00:51:37,973 --> 00:51:41,643
You know, I always thought of a relationship
as two people holding a stick.

798
00:51:41,643 --> 00:51:45,397
Sometimes the stick is short and you're close
and you can look into each other's eyes...

799
00:51:45,397 --> 00:51:48,108
and other times it's long and you can
barely see the other person...

800
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:50,652
but you both always
hold onto your end of the stick.

801
00:51:50,652 --> 00:51:52,696
You don't let it drop.

802
00:51:55,699 --> 00:51:58,911
I'm okay.
I'm just stressed.

803
00:51:58,994 --> 00:52:01,038
We should go out.

804
00:52:01,038 --> 00:52:03,207
Just you and me.

805
00:52:03,332 --> 00:52:06,335
Jesus, what?

806
00:52:06,335 --> 00:52:09,880
I just thought of
a great guy for you.

807
00:52:11,632 --> 00:52:14,301
Oh... I don't know.

808
00:52:17,971 --> 00:52:19,973
No weapons in the club.

809
00:52:19,973 --> 00:52:23,644
If you got a weapon, you gotta give 'em up
at the door. No exceptions.

810
00:52:23,644 --> 00:52:25,604
Would you move?

811
00:52:25,646 --> 00:52:27,898
All right.
Make room for her.

812
00:52:28,023 --> 00:52:30,108
Hey, Wall Street,
make way for the lady.

813
00:52:30,150 --> 00:52:32,069
- Hey. How are you?
- Hi. How are you?

814
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:34,363
- Good to see you. Have a good time.
- Thank you.

815
00:52:34,488 --> 00:52:38,158
- Hey, you're here.
- I'm glad I didn't bring my piece.

816
00:52:38,158 --> 00:52:41,119
- Hi. How are you?
- Hi.

817
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:44,540
- Uh-Where's-Wh-Where's, uh...
- Rand?

818
00:52:44,540 --> 00:52:46,542
He couldn't make it.

819
00:52:46,542 --> 00:52:49,628
Oh-Oh, I'm sorry
he couldn't make it.

820
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:52,005
- He, uh...
- I'm not.

821
00:52:53,507 --> 00:52:56,051
Oh, come on.
Let's dance.

822
00:52:56,176 --> 00:53:00,180
Oh, no-no. No-No, I don't...
I'm not-That's not really my thing.

823
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,224
Come on!

824
00:53:03,183 --> 00:53:05,143
More of a slow dancer.

825
00:53:11,024 --> 00:53:13,318
All right.

826
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,289
Thank you.

827
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:28,792
Hey, baby. Will you hold this for me?
Thank you. Hold my horn.

828
00:53:28,876 --> 00:53:31,837
Uh, that's a little something we call
"Serenade for a French Horn...

829
00:53:31,837 --> 00:53:35,007
in F-sharp."

830
00:53:35,007 --> 00:53:37,926
This next one...

831
00:53:37,926 --> 00:53:40,137
we call "Juniper."

832
00:53:40,220 --> 00:53:45,392
And if any of you out there
know what a juniper plant is...

833
00:53:46,727 --> 00:53:49,605
I think you'll understand.

834
00:53:49,605 --> 00:53:51,648
Peace.

835
00:53:52,733 --> 00:53:55,486
Oh, my God.
He just bowed to you.

836
00:53:55,486 --> 00:53:58,280
- It wasn't to me.
- It wasn't to me.

837
00:53:58,363 --> 00:54:01,450
- He doesn't even know me.
- I told him all about you already.

838
00:54:01,450 --> 00:54:03,994
- When?
- On the phone.

839
00:54:04,077 --> 00:54:07,080
Oh, my God.
I didn't even bow back.

840
00:54:14,004 --> 00:54:18,091
I'll introduce you to him after,
and you can bow then.

841
00:54:43,992 --> 00:54:49,540
Hey, you guys, that was great.
So flowing, man. I could feel it tonight...

842
00:54:49,540 --> 00:54:54,670
Hey! How's the comedienne?
Oh. Mmm.

843
00:54:54,670 --> 00:54:58,799
Oh, my God.

844
00:54:58,799 --> 00:55:02,302
- Oh! Oh, dizzy.
- You taste as good as ever.

845
00:55:02,302 --> 00:55:04,555
- You were great tonight.
- Oh, thank you.

846
00:55:04,555 --> 00:55:06,557
You were.
You were really good.

847
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:10,727
Well, I was just working off that energy
that you were sending up to me.

848
00:55:10,727 --> 00:55:14,815
Whew! You have
a really beautiful voice.

849
00:55:14,815 --> 00:55:17,317
Well, I can't take credit
for that, you know?

850
00:55:17,317 --> 00:55:21,780
It's all the big man.
Hey!

851
00:55:21,822 --> 00:55:23,699
You know, ever since
I became a minister...

852
00:55:23,699 --> 00:55:27,286
my vocal range
has just gotten insane.

853
00:55:27,327 --> 00:55:30,247
- You're a minister?
- Yes, yes.

854
00:55:30,247 --> 00:55:33,417
But don't worry.
Ministers are free to fornicate.

855
00:55:34,751 --> 00:55:37,212
Should we get a drink?

856
00:55:37,296 --> 00:55:39,464
Lots of'em.

857
00:55:39,464 --> 00:55:43,468
Go! Go!

858
00:55:43,510 --> 00:55:48,056
Tobey! Tobey! Tobey! Tobey!

859
00:55:52,686 --> 00:55:54,938
Go, baby.

860
00:55:57,191 --> 00:55:59,026
OwI Watch it!

861
00:55:59,026 --> 00:56:01,028
Sorry.

862
00:56:03,697 --> 00:56:06,074
Dante. Lewis, buddy.

863
00:56:08,202 --> 00:56:11,497
- Good to see you.
- Look at you.

864
00:56:11,497 --> 00:56:14,666
What is the deal with you two?

865
00:56:14,666 --> 00:56:18,378
Oh, come on.
"You taste as good as ever"?

866
00:56:18,378 --> 00:56:20,547
We had a thing in college.

867
00:56:20,547 --> 00:56:24,051
I didn't tell you because
I didn't want to discourage you.

868
00:56:24,051 --> 00:56:26,720
- Mmm.
- He's sexy!

869
00:56:27,721 --> 00:56:33,060
And very... attentive.

870
00:56:33,060 --> 00:56:35,103
Oh.

871
00:56:35,229 --> 00:56:38,065
He really is a freak, isn't he?

872
00:56:38,065 --> 00:56:40,818
You don't have to marry the guy.

873
00:56:43,695 --> 00:56:47,866
- So, what are we gonna do about this?
- This?

874
00:56:51,245 --> 00:56:55,332
Oh, come on. Don't tell me
you haven't thought about it...

875
00:56:55,332 --> 00:56:59,336
every time we've seen each other
since college.

876
00:57:01,463 --> 00:57:05,592
Uh-Oh, I-I-I've thought about it.

877
00:57:05,592 --> 00:57:08,345
Uh...

878
00:57:08,345 --> 00:57:11,431
- Sure, you're-you're-you're...
- I'm what?

879
00:57:13,767 --> 00:57:17,104
- Very...
- Very what?

880
00:57:17,104 --> 00:57:21,150
Uh...

881
00:57:21,150 --> 00:57:24,570
Talk dirty to me.

882
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:53,599
You taste amazing.

883
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:56,560
Thank you.

884
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:59,313
Um-Um, could you...
could you...

885
00:57:59,313 --> 00:58:04,985
could you stop doing whatever that it is
that you were just doing...

886
00:58:04,985 --> 00:58:08,989
and... leave?

887
00:58:10,741 --> 00:58:12,701
Oh.

888
00:58:12,826 --> 00:58:15,454
I would be wearing...

889
00:58:18,165 --> 00:58:20,125
shorts.

890
00:58:20,167 --> 00:58:23,629
And you would...

891
00:58:23,629 --> 00:58:26,548
be in a swimsuit?

892
00:58:26,548 --> 00:58:30,344
- Oh, God. Just relax.
- I'm sorry.

893
00:58:30,344 --> 00:58:34,431
It's just, you know,
you have a... husband.

894
00:58:34,431 --> 00:58:37,309
Rand.

895
00:58:37,309 --> 00:58:39,269
- What kind of name is that anyway?
- Oh, ah...

896
00:58:39,311 --> 00:58:42,105
Mm-mmm. No.

897
00:58:42,105 --> 00:58:47,027
- Doesn't matter. Okay?
- None of it matters, Tobey.

898
00:58:47,027 --> 00:58:49,613
I mean, in 50 years,
we're gonna be dead...

899
00:58:49,613 --> 00:58:52,282
and nobody's gonna remember us
or even know we existed.

900
00:58:52,282 --> 00:58:54,868
- So, come on.
- In 50 years, I'm only gonna be 86.

901
00:58:54,868 --> 00:58:58,288
Mmm. Whatever.

902
00:58:58,288 --> 00:59:00,541
My point is that
this is all so temporary...

903
00:59:00,541 --> 00:59:03,043
so let's just enjoy it.

904
00:59:03,043 --> 00:59:05,295
Please?

905
00:59:26,608 --> 00:59:28,652
Elaine.

906
00:59:28,777 --> 00:59:32,739
- Elaine!
- Hey-Hey...

907
00:59:32,739 --> 00:59:35,993
Elaine... is asleep.

908
00:59:37,161 --> 00:59:40,038
She's gone to bed.

909
00:59:40,038 --> 00:59:44,042
Uh, wait...

910
00:59:44,042 --> 00:59:46,712
You were just up there?

911
00:59:46,795 --> 00:59:49,590
Yes. Yes, I was.

912
00:59:50,757 --> 00:59:54,428
Nothing to write home about.

913
00:59:54,428 --> 00:59:57,723
I think I got a song out of it.

914
01:00:10,444 --> 01:00:11,361
Why would you do that?

915
01:00:11,403 --> 01:00:13,447
You know I invited
Elaine and her new boyfriend.

916
01:00:13,447 --> 01:00:16,950
I know, but he just looks so pathetic.
And, you know...

917
01:00:16,950 --> 01:00:19,286
- I forgot.
- You did not forget, Tom.

918
01:00:19,286 --> 01:00:22,122
Well, he's just blathering on
about how much he misses Elaine.

919
01:00:22,122 --> 01:00:24,416
He can't function without her.
He's gotta see her.

920
01:00:24,458 --> 01:00:27,169
You know, I wanted somebody here who
doesn't know anything about the theater -

921
01:00:27,169 --> 01:00:29,588
- so I could have somebody to talk to.
- Right. Fine.

922
01:00:29,588 --> 01:00:32,299
He's sitting far away
from Elaine. Next to Amis.

923
01:00:32,299 --> 01:00:34,384
The guy in the yellow turtleneck?

924
01:00:34,468 --> 01:00:37,471
Rebecca, he's your brother.
Don't do that to him.

925
01:00:37,471 --> 01:00:39,973
- My man.
- I, uh -

926
01:00:39,973 --> 01:00:42,059
- brought a bottle of wine.
- Thank you.

927
01:00:42,100 --> 01:00:44,603
That's what you're supposed to do
at a dinner party, right?

928
01:00:44,603 --> 01:00:46,563
- Very grown-up.
- Yep. Hey.

929
01:00:46,605 --> 01:00:49,608
- Hi. How are you?
- Hello?

930
01:00:49,608 --> 01:00:51,944
Your door was wide open.

931
01:00:54,112 --> 01:00:57,199
- Hi. Hi, my name's Tom.
- Hi. You look so pretty.

932
01:00:57,199 --> 01:00:59,201
- Thank you.
- So pretty. Hi.

933
01:00:59,326 --> 01:01:01,954
- Goren.
- Nice to meet you. Hi, Elaine.

934
01:01:01,954 --> 01:01:04,414
- Hello.
- Hi, hi. Nice to see you... again.

935
01:01:04,414 --> 01:01:08,502
Oh, wow. Wow, that was a lot of kisses.

936
01:01:08,502 --> 01:01:13,090
- Hello.
- Hey. Tobey.

937
01:01:13,090 --> 01:01:16,552
- Tobey. Tobey.
- Let me take your coat.

938
01:01:16,552 --> 01:01:18,679
- Hiya.
- Here you go.

939
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:20,722
- Yeah.
- Take your coat too.

940
01:01:20,722 --> 01:01:22,891
- Come on. Take it off.
- All right.

941
01:01:22,975 --> 01:01:24,935
No, the theater. No, no, no...

942
01:01:24,977 --> 01:01:27,146
the theater is completely different.

943
01:01:27,187 --> 01:01:29,356
I mean, it's all star-driven,
you know?

944
01:01:29,356 --> 01:01:33,026
Stars, stars, stars.
They can't walk. They can't talk.

945
01:01:33,026 --> 01:01:37,489
I mean, it's just like the film industry
where you hail from, my dear.

946
01:01:37,489 --> 01:01:39,992
Actually, Amis,
I hail from New Jersey.

947
01:01:39,992 --> 01:01:43,203
No? New Jers...
Charming.

948
01:01:43,203 --> 01:01:46,957
Charming as ever.
Tom, you are a lucky man.

949
01:01:46,957 --> 01:01:50,961
Spunk doesn't usually come
in such a beautiful package.

950
01:01:55,716 --> 01:01:58,343
You know, I...

951
01:01:58,343 --> 01:02:01,013
I think it's this, uh...
these departures...

952
01:02:01,013 --> 01:02:05,184
from the literatures
which-which makes it worse...

953
01:02:05,225 --> 01:02:07,769
in this society's, uh...
It goes, uh...

954
01:02:07,769 --> 01:02:10,189
the-the wrongest.

955
01:02:11,231 --> 01:02:15,235
- What?
- What do you mean, Goren?

956
01:02:15,235 --> 01:02:17,738
No. No, yeah...

957
01:02:17,738 --> 01:02:20,949
It-It's-Because it is this,
uh, connection...

958
01:02:20,949 --> 01:02:24,495
between the past and the futures.

959
01:02:24,578 --> 01:02:30,000
Uh-Well, because it-it was there
before any of the other arts.

960
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:34,505
- Except painting.
- And dance.

961
01:02:36,089 --> 01:02:38,467
This is great wine.

962
01:02:38,467 --> 01:02:41,303
Isn't it.

963
01:02:50,145 --> 01:02:53,065
So, Goren, are you...
technically a citizen?

964
01:02:58,070 --> 01:03:00,697
There are more than one, um...

965
01:03:00,697 --> 01:03:04,243
places for which, uh,
to be citizens with than this one.

966
01:03:12,584 --> 01:03:14,920
So, what, you're on like
a limited visa or something?

967
01:03:17,631 --> 01:03:19,883
You all right?

968
01:03:19,883 --> 01:03:21,844
- I am. I'm...
- Are you okay?

969
01:03:32,938 --> 01:03:35,482
Wow! This is good soup.

970
01:03:45,617 --> 01:03:49,246
- Tobey! We can't do this.
- What? What do-What do-What do you mean?

971
01:03:49,329 --> 01:03:51,290
It's all right.
They're, you know...

972
01:03:54,668 --> 01:03:57,421
We're not together anymore.

973
01:03:57,421 --> 01:03:59,381
Do you get that?

974
01:04:02,176 --> 01:04:04,469
But it-But it's not right
for me, Elaine.

975
01:04:07,598 --> 01:04:11,059
Ah-It-I mean,
it's Tobey and Elaine.

976
01:04:11,059 --> 01:04:14,229
That sounds right to me.
Those two names.

977
01:04:14,229 --> 01:04:18,108
It's-They-They-They go together.

978
01:04:18,192 --> 01:04:22,154
That's your plea?
That our names go together?

979
01:04:23,030 --> 01:04:25,282
It seems right.

980
01:04:26,366 --> 01:04:28,619
It's not right.

981
01:04:28,702 --> 01:04:32,498
I'm just starting with someone new,
and I'm happy.

982
01:04:32,539 --> 01:04:35,375
That...

983
01:04:35,375 --> 01:04:38,253
That-That-sprocket out there?

984
01:04:38,337 --> 01:04:42,966
He's in a unitard, for Chrissakes!

985
01:04:42,966 --> 01:04:45,260
Better. That is the Tobey
that I know.

986
01:04:45,385 --> 01:04:48,388
Oh, oh, oh,
"I think 'The Canterbury Tales'...

987
01:04:48,388 --> 01:04:51,517
"really provides a basis
for all of the modern literatures.

988
01:04:51,558 --> 01:04:55,062
- And watch me dance."
- You know, you're right, Tobey.

989
01:04:55,062 --> 01:04:57,523
You've-You hit the nail
on the head! He is.

990
01:04:57,523 --> 01:04:59,483
- He's a pretentious sprocket.
- Yes!

991
01:04:59,525 --> 01:05:01,568
He's a pretentious sprocket...

992
01:05:01,568 --> 01:05:04,863
with a huge cock!

993
01:05:08,408 --> 01:05:12,704
No-Well, he-he-he does not look...

994
01:05:12,704 --> 01:05:15,415
like he has a huge cock.

995
01:05:17,918 --> 01:05:21,296
Well, he does. And you...

996
01:05:21,296 --> 01:05:24,591
you don't know what
a relationship is.

997
01:05:48,282 --> 01:05:52,411
Boy, that water pressure in there
really sucks.

998
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:07,968
Mmm. It's been a long time, hasn't it?

999
01:06:07,968 --> 01:06:10,804
Where'd she find this guy,
Zorro, anyway?

1000
01:06:10,804 --> 01:06:15,017
It's Goren.
And let's not talk about him.

1001
01:06:18,604 --> 01:06:21,190
I gotta be up early for "Mommy and Me".

1002
01:06:26,778 --> 01:06:28,864
Okay.

1003
01:06:31,533 --> 01:06:34,369
"That's not really fair to say, now is it?

1004
01:06:34,453 --> 01:06:37,539
We've known each other for a long time.
I think we deserve each other's honesty."

1005
01:06:37,539 --> 01:06:40,834
"I have been in love with you
since the moment I saw you."

1006
01:06:40,834 --> 01:06:42,920
"You only think you have."

1007
01:06:44,796 --> 01:06:48,842
- "What's the difference?"
- That's a cocksucker of a speech.

1008
01:06:48,884 --> 01:06:51,053
How come I didn't get
the cursing gene?

1009
01:06:51,053 --> 01:06:54,264
You know, I've never had
this much trouble remembering my lines.

1010
01:06:54,348 --> 01:06:56,683
It must be menopause.

1011
01:06:56,683 --> 01:07:00,813
Becca, you're 38. And would you please
not talk about your vagina? You're my sister.

1012
01:07:00,813 --> 01:07:03,190
It's bad enough that my best friend
has sex with you.

1013
01:07:05,526 --> 01:07:09,154
Walk back to the theater
with me, would ya?

1014
01:07:14,326 --> 01:07:18,038
Hey! What the fuck?

1015
01:07:21,875 --> 01:07:23,836
Hey!

1016
01:07:27,798 --> 01:07:32,135
Hey-Hey-Hey.
Evel Knievel, what the fuck?

1017
01:07:32,135 --> 01:07:34,263
Since when do you smoke?

1018
01:07:34,388 --> 01:07:37,266
I know he's seeing someone.

1019
01:07:39,726 --> 01:07:43,397
You know, I wasn't really sure,
but that look confirmed it.

1020
01:07:43,397 --> 01:07:46,191
Hey, that's not fair. You said you already
knew he was seeing someone.

1021
01:07:46,191 --> 01:07:49,736
- So he is?
- No, I-I-I...

1022
01:07:49,736 --> 01:07:52,573
I mean, I-I-I know nothing.

1023
01:07:52,573 --> 01:07:54,950
I'm not the guy who tells
someone something like that.

1024
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:57,494
I refuse to be
forced into being that guy.

1025
01:07:57,494 --> 01:08:01,748
This is not about you, you little
fucking twit. Hey, you hit me!

1026
01:08:01,748 --> 01:08:04,668
You know, Tom's right about you.
You're the, uh, what did he call you?

1027
01:08:04,668 --> 01:08:08,422
The play-by-play guy. That's what you call
him, right, the guy who sits in the booth...

1028
01:08:08,422 --> 01:08:10,674
and talks about everything
that's goin' on without ever playing.

1029
01:08:10,716 --> 01:08:14,344
Never fucking participating.
Just letting life pass you by.

1030
01:08:14,428 --> 01:08:16,847
- Never participating!
- Well, if I'm that guy...

1031
01:08:16,847 --> 01:08:19,808
then he's the quarterback who wants to
screw everything with two legs.

1032
01:08:19,808 --> 01:08:23,061
To continue the...

1033
01:08:23,103 --> 01:08:26,148
the metaphor, that is.

1034
01:08:26,148 --> 01:08:28,484
Fuck!

1035
01:08:33,989 --> 01:08:36,658
Thanks for reading with me, Tobey.

1036
01:08:36,658 --> 01:08:39,244
I'm sorry. I'm so...

1037
01:08:56,678 --> 01:08:59,264
Oh, hey.

1038
01:09:01,642 --> 01:09:03,602
Cosmos...

1039
01:09:03,644 --> 01:09:06,313
would you be a sweetheart
and let Mr. Ronson in?

1040
01:09:06,313 --> 01:09:08,899
He's already here, Mom.

1041
01:09:11,360 --> 01:09:13,445
So they're really
that sensitive, huh?

1042
01:09:13,445 --> 01:09:16,323
Women don't seem
to believe that, but, yes, they are.

1043
01:09:16,323 --> 01:09:20,327
Oh, so now I'm being lumped
with all women?

1044
01:09:20,369 --> 01:09:23,330
- Pamela, we need to talk about somethin'.
- No.

1045
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:25,207
I know what you're gonna say.

1046
01:09:25,207 --> 01:09:28,752
And you're right. But...
But I don't want to.

1047
01:09:28,836 --> 01:09:31,964
Look, I can't...
I can't do this anymore.

1048
01:09:31,964 --> 01:09:34,341
We have to stop this.

1049
01:09:50,107 --> 01:09:53,360
- Hey, you wanna see what Cosmos taught me?
- Sure.

1050
01:09:53,360 --> 01:09:56,280
Oh!

1051
01:09:56,363 --> 01:09:58,991
- Mommy!
- Hey, is that my big boy?

1052
01:10:01,118 --> 01:10:03,537
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, we didn't expect you to be home.

1053
01:10:03,537 --> 01:10:06,206
Well, I-I missed my family,
so I came home early.

1054
01:10:08,834 --> 01:10:11,712
- Are you wearing cologne?
- No.

1055
01:10:13,088 --> 01:10:15,841
David learned some interesting
things on his play date today.

1056
01:10:15,841 --> 01:10:17,801
Oh, really. Like what?

1057
01:10:17,843 --> 01:10:20,846
I learned how to silence someone!

1058
01:10:20,846 --> 01:10:23,807
- How do you do that?
- You hit them in the balls.

1059
01:10:23,849 --> 01:10:25,809
Oh.

1060
01:10:25,893 --> 01:10:27,769
Yep.

1061
01:10:27,769 --> 01:10:29,771
That sounds like a good idea.

1062
01:10:32,649 --> 01:10:35,903
Okay, everybody, let's get ready
for dinner. Come on. Let's go.

1063
01:10:35,903 --> 01:10:38,405
Whoops. Okay.

1064
01:10:44,536 --> 01:10:46,872
Here you go, buddy.

1065
01:10:46,872 --> 01:10:49,666
Watch your hand.

1066
01:10:49,708 --> 01:10:52,002
- Here you go. Oh, sorry.
- Oops.

1067
01:10:53,712 --> 01:10:55,756
- There you go.
- Thanks.

1068
01:10:55,756 --> 01:10:57,716
Enjoy.

1069
01:11:02,095 --> 01:11:04,765
- You okay?
- Um...

1070
01:11:04,765 --> 01:11:06,725
I'm thinking about
dropping out of the play.

1071
01:11:06,767 --> 01:11:10,270
What? Why?

1072
01:11:10,270 --> 01:11:14,233
Things aren't working
out the way I want them to.

1073
01:11:14,233 --> 01:11:16,944
Rebecca, you always have these moments
of doubts before an opening.

1074
01:11:16,944 --> 01:11:19,279
- You know? I was...
- Not about so many things.

1075
01:11:22,825 --> 01:11:24,785
What are you doin', Tom?

1076
01:11:27,621 --> 01:11:32,125
I look at you, I feel like I don't even know
who you are anymore.

1077
01:11:32,125 --> 01:11:34,962
- And maybe that's my fault.
- No.

1078
01:11:34,962 --> 01:11:38,006
It's not your fault. I, uh...

1079
01:11:40,008 --> 01:11:44,471
I just-I feel lost.

1080
01:11:44,471 --> 01:11:49,226
And, uh, I don't know
who I am right now.

1081
01:11:58,944 --> 01:12:02,406
You should leave, Tom,
till you figure it out.

1082
01:12:02,406 --> 01:12:05,284
We can't do it for you.

1083
01:12:07,286 --> 01:12:09,746
What a good boy.

1084
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:11,832
Eatin' all that spaghetti.

1085
01:12:13,584 --> 01:12:15,544
Sorry, I'm late.

1086
01:12:15,586 --> 01:12:18,922
It's all the idiots.

1087
01:12:18,922 --> 01:12:21,383
- Could you explain to me the psychology...
- Tobey...

1088
01:12:21,466 --> 01:12:25,262
behind the people who wait in a long line
at the store and don't take their money out...

1089
01:12:25,262 --> 01:12:28,015
until their total is rung up,
as if it's a surprise?

1090
01:12:28,015 --> 01:12:30,517
"Oh, you want money for this?

1091
01:12:30,642 --> 01:12:34,855
"Well, I had no idea.
Wait, while I unzip my fanny pack...

1092
01:12:34,855 --> 01:12:37,983
and dig through my man-purse
for my wallet."

1093
01:12:38,066 --> 01:12:42,571
So, do you think
you might be avoiding the issue?

1094
01:12:42,571 --> 01:12:46,283
- What issue is that?
- That you've been following me?

1095
01:12:46,366 --> 01:12:50,412
I think not.

1096
01:12:53,916 --> 01:12:56,710
Oh. Oh! That was you.

1097
01:12:56,710 --> 01:12:59,630
I thought-I thought it might have been,
but there was just, you know -

1098
01:12:59,630 --> 01:13:02,716
- so much of a coincidence.
- What were you hoping to find out, Tobey?

1099
01:13:02,716 --> 01:13:06,804
That I'm a Libra?
That I had a heart attack?

1100
01:13:06,845 --> 01:13:08,847
Oh, you had a heart attack?

1101
01:13:08,847 --> 01:13:12,309
I also had a withholding father
and an inappropriate mother.

1102
01:13:12,392 --> 01:13:15,395
And when I was 20, I had a nervous breakdown.

1103
01:13:15,395 --> 01:13:19,566
And, I think it's time
to terminate your therapy.

1104
01:13:19,566 --> 01:13:22,402
I'm sorry?

1105
01:13:22,402 --> 01:13:25,572
Well, this is not working out.

1106
01:13:25,572 --> 01:13:28,367
Well, Tobey, not for you
and not for me.

1107
01:13:30,410 --> 01:13:36,166
Okay.

1108
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:38,919
Have a little trust, Tobey.

1109
01:13:38,919 --> 01:13:42,172
The world is not against you.

1110
01:13:43,215 --> 01:13:47,219
I mean, no wonder
his advice was so bad.

1111
01:13:47,261 --> 01:13:49,346
He had a nervous breakdown.

1112
01:13:49,346 --> 01:13:51,306
A heart attack.
Messed up parents.

1113
01:13:51,348 --> 01:13:55,102
I mean, could he be
any more unhealthy?

1114
01:13:55,102 --> 01:13:58,355
He said something to me, though,
when I left, that really bugged me.

1115
01:13:58,355 --> 01:14:03,443
He said, "The world is not against
you, Tobey. Have a little trust."

1116
01:14:03,443 --> 01:14:05,779
Well, that kinda goes
against my whole philosophy.

1117
01:14:05,779 --> 01:14:09,324
"The world is not against me." Huh? I
mean, well, then how do you explain my life?

1118
01:14:09,324 --> 01:14:11,910
Jesus Christ!
Can you just shut up?

1119
01:14:13,453 --> 01:14:17,457
I mean, I-I don't have time
for this bullshit about your shrink.

1120
01:14:17,457 --> 01:14:21,336
Have you noticed that I've been kicked out
of my house and my life is falling apart?

1121
01:14:23,213 --> 01:14:25,799
Oh, yeah. Okay.

1122
01:14:28,010 --> 01:14:30,220
I gotta go.

1123
01:14:36,935 --> 01:14:39,438
Do you think I should get Botox?

1124
01:14:39,438 --> 01:14:42,149
- Definitely.
- Really?

1125
01:14:42,149 --> 01:14:45,652
Uh-huh. If you wanna
lose me as your friend.

1126
01:14:45,652 --> 01:14:48,280
You're so strict.

1127
01:14:50,282 --> 01:14:52,951
I saw that bitch at school.
She actually said "hi" to me.

1128
01:14:52,951 --> 01:14:55,871
- What did you do?
- Oh, I showed her.

1129
01:14:55,871 --> 01:14:58,582
I said "hi" back and smiled.
And then I just walked away.

1130
01:14:58,582 --> 01:15:01,877
She must be reeling.

1131
01:15:04,129 --> 01:15:07,299
- How are the kids doing?
- They're okay.

1132
01:15:07,299 --> 01:15:11,678
He comes by to see them every day.
I just can't bear to look at him.

1133
01:15:11,678 --> 01:15:13,806
He's in that overly sweet
hangdog stage...

1134
01:15:13,806 --> 01:15:16,517
where I could set him on fire,
and he'd thank me for it.

1135
01:15:16,517 --> 01:15:19,019
It's not a bad idea.

1136
01:15:19,144 --> 01:15:23,315
How's "Goren the Terrible"?

1137
01:15:23,315 --> 01:15:25,776
Terribly boring.

1138
01:15:25,776 --> 01:15:28,070
He does wanna have a baby though.

1139
01:15:55,514 --> 01:15:58,892
Hey, can I have a blintze...
this early?

1140
01:15:58,892 --> 01:16:00,894
It's all I've been thinking
about since last night.

1141
01:16:00,894 --> 01:16:04,565
It's a-It's an acceptable
crossover food, right?

1142
01:16:04,565 --> 01:16:08,402
Why do you think
we're such wiseasses?

1143
01:16:08,402 --> 01:16:12,865
Probably a good way to avoid thinking
about the fact that we're all gonna die.

1144
01:16:12,865 --> 01:16:14,825
When are you gonna get over that?

1145
01:16:14,867 --> 01:16:17,119
Um...

1146
01:16:17,119 --> 01:16:19,496
never.

1147
01:16:19,496 --> 01:16:21,456
It's a pretty big deal.

1148
01:16:21,498 --> 01:16:24,042
You know what I think?
I think it's a good way...

1149
01:16:24,042 --> 01:16:26,420
to avoid taking
responsibility for anything.

1150
01:16:26,545 --> 01:16:30,215
It's like, "Hey, we're only joking, right?
We're all gonna die, right?"

1151
01:16:30,215 --> 01:16:32,509
You and me, we're missing
the biggest moments of our lives...

1152
01:16:32,509 --> 01:16:35,387
'cause all we can talk about
is sports and blintzes.

1153
01:16:37,389 --> 01:16:39,475
It's just it's, uh...

1154
01:16:39,475 --> 01:16:42,853
it's pretty depressing
not living with your kids.

1155
01:16:45,355 --> 01:16:47,316
Or the woman you love.

1156
01:16:49,401 --> 01:16:52,112
Or the woman that you love.

1157
01:16:52,112 --> 01:16:57,701
Just because you happen to be an immensely
flawed and selfish human being.

1158
01:16:57,701 --> 01:17:01,330
Hey, you're not so great yourself.

1159
01:17:06,251 --> 01:17:11,507
I think the blintze is fully acceptable
as a crossover food...

1160
01:17:11,507 --> 01:17:14,343
and I would like one myself.

1161
01:17:14,426 --> 01:17:17,471
- You're the man.
- No, you the man.

1162
01:17:17,471 --> 01:17:19,515
Up top.

1163
01:17:23,435 --> 01:17:25,521
I guess
the first thing I should say...

1164
01:17:25,521 --> 01:17:29,107
is that my name is not Tobey.

1165
01:17:30,234 --> 01:17:32,194
It's Todd.

1166
01:17:32,236 --> 01:17:34,404
Hi, Todd.

1167
01:17:35,697 --> 01:17:38,575
No, it's not-It's, uh, it's Tom.

1168
01:17:38,575 --> 01:17:40,619
My name is Tom.

1169
01:17:40,661 --> 01:17:43,997
It really is, okay?
And, uh, secondly...

1170
01:17:43,997 --> 01:17:47,918
I have-I have no relation
at all to deli meats.

1171
01:17:47,918 --> 01:17:53,215
I just made it up to try to fit in.

1172
01:17:56,468 --> 01:18:00,055
I don't know...
I don't know what I am...

1173
01:18:00,055 --> 01:18:04,101
but, um, I'm pretty sure
that I have a problem.

1174
01:18:04,143 --> 01:18:08,021
Although, not as-as big
a problem as all of you seem to have.

1175
01:18:08,021 --> 01:18:11,733
Um, anybody else hot?

1176
01:18:11,733 --> 01:18:15,070
Uh, I, uh...

1177
01:18:15,070 --> 01:18:19,867
I also use humor and, uh,
complaints about the temperature...

1178
01:18:19,867 --> 01:18:23,036
as a way of diverting attention...

1179
01:18:23,036 --> 01:18:27,666
from the, uh,
from the very serious fact, uh...

1180
01:18:27,666 --> 01:18:30,127
that I'm ruining my life.

1181
01:18:30,127 --> 01:18:33,505
And, uh...

1182
01:18:33,505 --> 01:18:38,552
I just-I just thought it would do me
some good to tell my real story here today.

1183
01:18:38,552 --> 01:18:42,055
So, uh...

1184
01:18:42,055 --> 01:18:48,061
I, uh, I come from a family
of poor peasants.

1185
01:18:48,061 --> 01:18:52,191
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm just kiddin'. Um...

1186
01:19:16,131 --> 01:19:18,592
It-It's hims, again.

1187
01:19:22,429 --> 01:19:27,559
Mabel? George?
Come here, please.

1188
01:19:27,559 --> 01:19:30,103
Now Mr. Bertram
will be joining us for dinner tonight.

1189
01:19:30,103 --> 01:19:32,272
Rlease make the arrangements.

1190
01:19:36,443 --> 01:19:41,323
All right, Debbie.

1191
01:19:41,323 --> 01:19:45,285
Confound it,
where is that daughter of mine?

1192
01:19:45,285 --> 01:19:47,955
Oh, Daddy, I'm comin'.

1193
01:20:21,989 --> 01:20:24,074
- Trust us.
- Trust us.

1194
01:20:24,074 --> 01:20:26,451
- We're all about trust.
- Come on.

1195
01:20:26,451 --> 01:20:29,371
- Okay. Here you go.
- Come on.

1196
01:20:48,515 --> 01:20:52,561
Come in.

1197
01:20:53,520 --> 01:20:56,648
Popular lady.

1198
01:20:56,648 --> 01:21:00,861
I think these are
from your husband. Again.

1199
01:21:00,861 --> 01:21:03,947
- Break a leg.
- Thank you.

1200
01:21:26,595 --> 01:21:31,391
Sweetheart, I'm sorry to interrupt
your preshow cry.

1201
01:21:31,391 --> 01:21:33,727
All the best ones have 'em.

1202
01:21:39,566 --> 01:21:41,735
We're all
in this together, my dear.

1203
01:21:41,777 --> 01:21:45,781
All damned to the theater.

1204
01:21:45,781 --> 01:21:48,075
Condemned to live through our art.

1205
01:21:48,075 --> 01:21:51,578
For we do not know
how to live through our lives.

1206
01:21:51,578 --> 01:21:54,414
We are islands.

1207
01:21:54,414 --> 01:21:56,667
Francis...

1208
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:58,710
my director...

1209
01:21:58,752 --> 01:22:02,756
I am a mother and a wife first
and foremost...

1210
01:22:02,756 --> 01:22:05,884
and you should go fuck yourself.

1211
01:22:10,597 --> 01:22:12,474
Welcome to tonight's...

1212
01:22:12,474 --> 01:22:15,644
premiere performance
of Edmund Middleton's Fifty Means.

1213
01:22:15,727 --> 01:22:18,605
Oh, these are good seats.

1214
01:22:18,605 --> 01:22:20,566
- Okay.
- Enjoy the show.

1215
01:22:20,566 --> 01:22:23,777
That should be me.

1216
01:22:23,777 --> 01:22:26,822
- What'd you say?
- Nothing.

1217
01:22:31,118 --> 01:22:33,829
You go on back to the house.
I'll get the rest.

1218
01:22:41,587 --> 01:22:46,216
I never thought
I'd say this, but I'm happy to be home.

1219
01:22:46,216 --> 01:22:50,095
Nothing much has changed
around here, but then again, it never does.

1220
01:22:52,139 --> 01:22:54,433
I'm miserable.

1221
01:22:58,479 --> 01:23:01,607
And seein' you miserable
isn't helping any.

1222
01:23:03,442 --> 01:23:06,487
- What are we gonna do?
- I don't know.

1223
01:23:10,491 --> 01:23:13,368
We gotta do somethin'.

1224
01:23:24,087 --> 01:23:27,424
There she is.
You go talk to her.

1225
01:23:27,508 --> 01:23:30,511
And you go find a pen
and a piece of paper.

1226
01:23:34,181 --> 01:23:38,268
Hey. I thought that was you.

1227
01:23:38,310 --> 01:23:40,354
Tobey.

1228
01:23:42,314 --> 01:23:46,193
- Not now, okay?
- You don't return my calls.

1229
01:23:46,193 --> 01:23:50,364
I need a, uh, pen and a piece of paper.
It's an emergency.

1230
01:23:50,364 --> 01:23:53,033
Tobey, why do you
have to make this so hard?

1231
01:23:53,033 --> 01:23:55,953
Elaine, it's hard for me too.

1232
01:23:56,995 --> 01:24:00,499
Oh, my goodness!

1233
01:24:00,499 --> 01:24:03,502
Listens, I-I want you
to stop calling the houses...

1234
01:24:03,544 --> 01:24:09,007
and, I-I want you
to stays away from her for all the times.

1235
01:24:09,007 --> 01:24:11,885
Why is everything plural
with this guy?

1236
01:24:11,885 --> 01:24:14,471
Oh, insult face to my faces?

1237
01:24:14,471 --> 01:24:16,598
- Tobey.
- What?

1238
01:24:16,723 --> 01:24:20,435
- This is Rebecca's night, okay?
- What? What? I know.

1239
01:24:20,435 --> 01:24:24,565
- I'm sorry, I dropped the pen there.
- Oh, I'll get it.

1240
01:24:24,565 --> 01:24:26,525
Hey.

1241
01:24:26,525 --> 01:24:29,403
- Those aren't your flowers, sir.
- You don't understand.

1242
01:24:29,403 --> 01:24:31,864
I need to get these
to Rebecca Pollack backstage. So...

1243
01:24:31,905 --> 01:24:36,910
I'm sorry, she doesn't accept
stolen flowers in intermissions.

1244
01:24:36,910 --> 01:24:41,540
Oh, no. Can you at least just...
Can you get her this note?

1245
01:24:41,582 --> 01:24:44,042
I'm her husband.
Please, just give her that.

1246
01:24:44,042 --> 01:24:47,629
- We're talkin'here, "Gorens."
- Come.

1247
01:24:48,881 --> 01:24:51,341
- I'm talkin' to her, if you don't mind.
- I do mind.

1248
01:24:51,425 --> 01:24:54,553
- It's not gonna happen.
- I said I'd like to talk to her.

1249
01:24:54,553 --> 01:24:57,723
- Release her.
- I'm not gonna release her.

1250
01:24:57,806 --> 01:25:00,851
Okay. Wait a minute!

1251
01:25:00,851 --> 01:25:02,978
Hey! That's not...
No running. No running.

1252
01:25:02,978 --> 01:25:05,022
- Stop it!
- You "shtop" it!

1253
01:25:05,022 --> 01:25:07,900
Sir, there's no running in the theater.

1254
01:25:07,983 --> 01:25:11,069
Oh, my God.

1255
01:25:11,069 --> 01:25:13,071
Sir, stay right there.
There's no running in the theater.

1256
01:25:13,071 --> 01:25:15,115
There's no running in the theater.

1257
01:25:15,115 --> 01:25:18,535
We got a runner. We got a runnerI Okay.

1258
01:25:19,453 --> 01:25:22,831
Oh! Pardon me.

1259
01:25:25,667 --> 01:25:27,669
West aisle.

1260
01:25:27,794 --> 01:25:29,671
- Come on!
- Sorry.

1261
01:25:29,671 --> 01:25:33,008
- Hey! Watch it. You're a jerk.
- Oh, God!

1262
01:25:33,091 --> 01:25:35,844
- Right there, sweetheart.
- Ow!

1263
01:25:35,844 --> 01:25:39,097
Why are you sweating?

1264
01:25:39,097 --> 01:25:44,144
I saw Goren.
I pushed him into a plant.

1265
01:25:44,144 --> 01:25:46,522
I stole some flowers.

1266
01:25:46,647 --> 01:25:50,192
- Oh, that sounds great. Good job.
- Yeah, you too.

1267
01:25:59,993 --> 01:26:03,497
Mrs. Pollack, final scene is up.

1268
01:26:03,497 --> 01:26:06,708
Thank you.

1269
01:26:13,841 --> 01:26:18,470
Who knows if she'll ever
come out of that room.

1270
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:20,848
But I wouldn't blame her
if she didn't.

1271
01:26:20,848 --> 01:26:25,853
Hell, comin'back here
after so long, for what?

1272
01:26:25,853 --> 01:26:30,315
For us?
For this place?

1273
01:26:30,315 --> 01:26:34,903
Somehow, It doesn't make
a whole lotta sense to me.

1274
01:26:42,035 --> 01:26:47,624
- The night air. It feels good.
- This is the last line of the play.

1275
01:26:47,624 --> 01:26:50,878
- You know it does, Laura.
- So what?

1276
01:26:50,878 --> 01:26:54,631
I gotta do something.
Excuse me. Sorry.

1277
01:26:54,715 --> 01:26:58,927
I never thought I'd be able to say that again.

1278
01:26:58,927 --> 01:27:03,557
- Stop it!
- Let me just get through here. Rardon me.

1279
01:27:03,557 --> 01:27:05,392
Oh!

1280
01:27:05,517 --> 01:27:09,646
Give me back my hair!
Give me my hair!

1281
01:27:10,647 --> 01:27:13,442
Stop him!

1282
01:27:13,525 --> 01:27:16,528
Ushers, full alert!
East aisle. Stage approach.

1283
01:27:16,528 --> 01:27:19,865
Stop!

1284
01:27:52,105 --> 01:27:55,943
Hey!

1285
01:27:55,984 --> 01:27:58,654
Get off!

1286
01:28:05,077 --> 01:28:08,539
It's okay.

1287
01:28:08,539 --> 01:28:11,583
This is my husband.

1288
01:28:12,876 --> 01:28:15,379
This loser?

1289
01:28:18,423 --> 01:28:20,467
This loser.

1290
01:28:36,942 --> 01:28:39,194
Bravo.

1291
01:28:50,581 --> 01:28:53,167
Elaine!

1292
01:29:02,009 --> 01:29:04,344
Did you like the play?

1293
01:29:10,726 --> 01:29:14,855
- Come on, let's go.
- Wait, wait!

1294
01:29:18,650 --> 01:29:21,361
You're the one for me!

1295
01:29:23,155 --> 01:29:25,908
Is this part of the play?

1296
01:29:25,908 --> 01:29:29,620
Yes, yes. Yes.
It is part of the play.

1297
01:29:29,703 --> 01:29:31,997
Uh, uh, this is the part...

1298
01:29:33,999 --> 01:29:36,877
of the play
where we come together...

1299
01:29:36,877 --> 01:29:39,630
and never leave each other.

1300
01:29:40,881 --> 01:29:43,091
And some...
somehow I feel like it...

1301
01:29:43,091 --> 01:29:46,136
it was written a long time ago,
and I just...

1302
01:29:47,721 --> 01:29:51,683
I just didn't trust the script,
'cause I don't wanna die.

1303
01:29:51,683 --> 01:29:54,436
- What?
- Wha...

1304
01:29:54,561 --> 01:29:57,523
Why do I always
have to be equated with death?

1305
01:29:57,523 --> 01:30:00,025
- I agree.
- What-Wait...

1306
01:30:00,108 --> 01:30:02,611
Th-That didn't come out right. I...

1307
01:30:06,949 --> 01:30:10,994
I don't want to be a cold,
sarcastic, blocked-off man anymore.

1308
01:30:12,162 --> 01:30:15,123
I'm not gonna be.

1309
01:30:15,123 --> 01:30:18,919
And, it's not gonna be easy...

1310
01:30:18,919 --> 01:30:21,463
but I wanna struggle...

1311
01:30:21,463 --> 01:30:23,465
with you.

1312
01:30:30,063 --> 01:30:34,609
I love you.

1313
01:30:34,059 --> 01:30:36,436
And...

1314
01:30:36,436 --> 01:30:39,982
all I can do is say that
and let you do with it what you will.

1315
01:30:40,065 --> 01:30:43,152
And if you...
if you won't be with me...

1316
01:30:43,152 --> 01:30:45,612
I can accept that.

1317
01:30:45,612 --> 01:30:50,117
'Cause I-I want you to be happy.

1318
01:30:53,745 --> 01:30:55,956
Tobey. Tobey.

1319
01:30:57,833 --> 01:31:00,085
I have tried...

1320
01:31:00,085 --> 01:31:04,923
very hard to stop.

1321
01:31:04,923 --> 01:31:09,303
But somehow, I still love you.

1322
01:31:09,303 --> 01:31:12,181
Oh, my God. Thank God!

1323
01:31:12,181 --> 01:31:16,310
'Cause all that stuff I was saying about
being able to let you go, that was just crap.

1324
01:31:16,310 --> 01:31:19,313
I'd have to hunt you down. Who wants to
spend all their life doin' that...

1325
01:31:19,313 --> 01:31:23,400
when there's some many other
things to do before we d...

1326
01:31:52,346 --> 01:31:54,807
Sure, I'll be right back.

1327
01:31:54,807 --> 01:31:58,101
And how are you doing here?

1328
01:31:58,101 --> 01:32:02,189
Oh, God.
Do I look fat here?

1329
01:32:03,482 --> 01:32:06,735
Which one are you?

1330
01:32:06,735 --> 01:32:09,363
- You look great.
- Excuse me.

1331
01:32:09,363 --> 01:32:11,949
I don't mean to bother you...

1332
01:32:12,032 --> 01:32:15,494
but I recognized you from your book.

1333
01:32:15,494 --> 01:32:20,207
My son and I have spent so many great days
in New York together because of you.

1334
01:32:20,207 --> 01:32:22,876
Would you sign it for me, please?

1335
01:32:22,876 --> 01:32:25,129
Sure.

1336
01:32:27,214 --> 01:32:30,509
You must be a great daddy.

1337
01:32:30,509 --> 01:32:34,012
Thank you.
We're very proud of him.

1338
01:32:34,012 --> 01:32:36,056
Oh.

1339
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:41,103
Oh, yes. We are very proud of him.

1340
01:32:43,105 --> 01:32:45,399
Okay.

1341
01:32:45,399 --> 01:32:47,526
Here's how it's gonna go.

1342
01:32:47,609 --> 01:32:50,821
I'm gonna get up
and go into the bathroom on the left.

1343
01:32:50,821 --> 01:32:53,991
Wait one minute...

1344
01:32:58,287 --> 01:33:00,330
and then you come in.

1345
01:33:08,422 --> 01:33:12,885
One, two, three...

1346
01:33:12,885 --> 01:33:17,681
Seventeen, 18...

1347
01:33:17,723 --> 01:33:21,852
nineteen-Daddy will be right back.

1348
01:33:23,020 --> 01:33:28,108
Twenty-four, 25, 26...

1349
01:33:28,108 --> 01:33:30,277
Forty-three...

1350
01:33:33,906 --> 01:33:36,200
Elaine has found in Tobey...

1351
01:33:36,241 --> 01:33:39,328
a man she can trust to love her...

1352
01:33:39,411 --> 01:33:41,955
to be her rock-solid baseline.

1353
01:33:41,955 --> 01:33:44,791
In Elaine, Tobey
has found his life's melody -

1354
01:33:44,791 --> 01:33:48,295
- his grace note.
- Come on now. Thank you. Hey.

1355
01:33:48,337 --> 01:33:52,382
Do you, Tobias, take this woman to be
your lawfully wedded wife...

1356
01:33:52,382 --> 01:33:56,428
to have and to hold,
until death do you part?

1357
01:33:56,428 --> 01:33:59,723
could you not mention death?

1358
01:33:59,723 --> 01:34:03,435
Uh, uh, "as long
as we both shall live."

1359
01:34:07,189 --> 01:34:10,275
- I do.
- I do.

1360
01:34:10,317 --> 01:34:12,402
- Yea!
- Whoo! Say "booyah."

1361
01:34:12,444 --> 01:34:14,404
- Booyah!
- Booyah!

1362
01:34:16,782 --> 01:34:19,117
Put me down!

1363
01:34:21,453 --> 01:34:23,831
Hey, Tobey...

1364
01:34:23,831 --> 01:34:26,458
I'm proud of you.

1365
01:34:39,847 --> 01:34:44,017
- Hey, hey! Hey!
- Baby, baby, go, go! Get him!

1366
01:34:44,017 --> 01:34:46,687
I just got married.
Come on, that's legal.

1367
01:34:46,687 --> 01:34:51,567
- I was behind the...
- That's our car!

1368
01:34:51,567 --> 01:34:53,694
Every time!

1369
01:34:53,819 --> 01:34:56,321
Every time!

1370
01:35:00,033 --> 01:35:02,286
<i>All right all you plant lovers...</i>

1371
01:35:02,369 --> 01:35:04,329
<i>you people lovers,
you life lovers...</i>

1372
01:35:04,371 --> 01:35:07,291
<i>this one's called "Juniper."</i>

1373
01:35:07,374 --> 01:35:09,668
<i>And it goes like this.</i>
