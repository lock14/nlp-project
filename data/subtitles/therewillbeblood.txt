“丹尼尔普兰优”



1902年



各位女士先生
Ladies and gentlemen,



我至今已走遍北达克达州大半土地
I've traveled over half our state to be here tonight.



由于新油井的开凿，我来晚了点
I couldn't get away sooner because my new well was coming in



我得去监督一下
at Coyote Hills and I had to see about it.



那口井现在日产两千桶油
That well is now flowing at 2,000 barrels



每周都给我带来五千美元进帐
and it's paying me an income of $5,000 a week.



我还在安特洛有16口量产油井
l have two others drilling and l have 16 producing at Antelope,



各位女士先生，若我说我是油商，你们也会同意
so, ladies and gentlemen,
if l say l'm an oilman, you will agree.



现在，你们有了绝佳的机会
Now, you have a great chance here,



但一不小心还是会赔光本钱
but bear in mind you could lose it all if you're not careful.



在所有凿井碰运气的人之中
Out of all men that beg for a chance to drill your lots,



也许20个有1个能成为油商
maybe one in twenty will be oilmen.



剩下的都是投机客
The rest will be speculators,



所以才有人会介入你们和油商间
that's men trying to get between you and the oilmen



赚取那些原本应属于你们的钱
to get some of the money that ought, by rights, come to you.



就算你们找到的人有钱又想凿井
Even if you find one that has money and means to drill,



他也可能对于凿井一无所知
he'll maybe know nothing about drilling.



那样他就得雇请人手
He'll have to hire the job out on contract,



接着你们就得指望包工
and then you're depending on a contractor,



他的动作俐落纯熟
who'll rush the job through



找新工作就跟他的动作一样快
so he can get another contract just as quick as he can.



这一行就是这样
This is the way that this works.



你出多少？别浪费时间
What is your offer? We're wasting time.



请安静
Please!



我自己凿井
l do my own drilling.



我的手下就是我的手下，他们也是我熟识的人
And the men that work for me,
work for me, and they are men l know.



我认真经营，也谨慎监督
l make it my business to be there and to see their work.



我不会乱扔工具，又到处乱找
l don't lose my tools in the hole
and spend months fishing for them.



我不会敲坏水泥
l don't botch the cementing off



让水流进洞里，搞砸整块地
and let water in the hole and ruin the whole lease.



我是个爱家的人
l'm a family man.



我经营的是家族事业，这是我儿子兼伙伴，H.W.普兰优
l run a family business. This is my son
and my partner, H.W. Plainview.



少有油商能有如此家族伙伴关系
We offer you the bond of family that very few oilmen can understand.



在这一行，只有我是如此做事
l'm fixed like no other company in this field



因为我的灰狼坡油井已开始量产
and that's because my Coyote Hills well has just come in.



我有一组设备随时准备上线
l have a string of tools all ready to put to work.



一周内就能运送整组设备过来
l can load a rig onto trucks and have them here in a week.



钻油井的木头我有熟人会帮忙
l have business connections,
so l can get the lumber for the derricks.



时间这么赶，得靠朋友帮忙
Such things go by friendship in a rush like this.



因此我也敢保证能动手钻探
And this is why l can guarantee to start drilling



并提供现金来证明我说的话
and to put up the cash to back my word.



我向各位保证
l assure you, ladies and gentlemen,



不管其他人保证要怎么做
no matter what the others promise to do,



他们根本做不到我所做的承诺
when it comes to the showdown, they won't be there.



坐下!你没有权利...
Sit down! Sit down, you have no right...



我们讨论一下这人说的话吧
Let us discuss what the man has to say.



- 你相信他吗？- 我们讨论一下吧
-Prescott, do you trust this man?
-Let's discuss what he has to say.



1911年



- 他的话毫无逻辑 - 他知道什么？我的家当都在那里！
-There's logic to what he's saying.
-How does he know? My lot is there!
1911年



- 他的话毫无逻辑 - 他知道什么？我的家当都在那里！
-There's logic to what he's saying.
-How does he know? My lot is there!



两三年，有可能要十年
Two or three years, it could be ten years!



-我们除了互相争执啥都没有 -看看那里的那口井
-We gain nothing by losing our heads!
-Look at that well out there!



没有人在吵架
Nobody's losing their heads.



你不该到这里的
You have no business being here!



叫那女人坐下
Sit that woman down, sir!



你可以坐下
You can sit down.



普兰优先生，请别走
Mr. Plainview! Please, Mr. Plainview.



不，先生，你要去哪里？
No, Mr. Plainview! No, where are you going?



-我不需要租这块地，谢谢 -可是我们需要你
-l don't need the lease. Thank you.
-But we need you.



这太混乱了，谢谢你拨空给我
Too much confusion. Thank you for your time.



不，没有什么混乱
No, no, there's no confusion.



你们心甘情愿，我才会要这块地
l wouldn't take the lease if you gave it to me as a gift.



班克先生，我不想浪费你的时间
Mr. Bankside, I'm not going to waste your time.



我也会感激你不浪费我的时间
I'd certainly appreciate it if you didn't waste mine.



如果你想跟我签约，我们十天内就能开始凿井
Now, if you wish to sign with me, we
can have a well drilling within 10 days.



你的地在现存油井的北边
Your lot is further north from the discovery well up here.



那表示我们可能得凿深一点
That means we'll probably have to dig deeper.



如果那里的油跟我想的一样多
And if there's as much oil here as l think there is,



就会更难凿，不过一凿到就发了
it'll be harder to reach, but once
we find it, we can take it right out.



动作要快，油很快就会被凿光了
We have to act quickly, because
very soon these fields will be dry.



我要你知道自己想怎么做
l need you to know what you want to do.



由于现存油井的距离
Now, because of the distance from the discovery well,



我付的使用费会少一点
l'll pay you a smaller royalty than you'd get down there



不过我会给你一千美元签约金
but l'm prepared to give you a $ 1,000 bonus on your lot.



你说的使用费是多少？
What kind of royalty are you talking about?



六分之一，加上十天内开凿的保证
One-sixth, plus a guarantee to start drilling within 10 days.



这种条件你在别处绝对找不到
Now, that's something you won't find anywhere else.



夫人，你小孩几岁了？
What age are your children, ma'am?



10岁和12岁
Ten and twelve.



普兰优先生，我有个问题，你太太人呢？
Mr. Plainview, a question, sir. Where is your wife?



她因难产过世了，夫人
She died in childbirth, Mrs. Bankside.



我跟儿子一起相依为命
So it's just me and my son now.



就快喷油了，老板
lt's coming in, boss!



听见没？
Hear it?



普兰优先生？
Mr. Plainview?



什么事？
Yes?



你就是丹尼尔普兰优？
Are you Daniel Plainview?



对
Yes.



有何贵干？
What can l do for you?



你在找油
You look for oil.



没错
That's right.



你花多少钱租用有藏油的土地？
What do you pay for a place that has it?



-看情况 -看什么情况？
-Well, that depends. -What does it depend on?



有很多
On a lot of things.



如果我说我知道一个地方有油，那里的地价钱又便宜
lf l told you l knew a place that had oil
where land could be bought cheaply,



你想这消息值多少钱？
what do you think that would be worth?



我想...你该让我知道你知道什么
l think that you should let me know what you know



然后我们再谈交易的事
and then we'll try and work something out.



-我能坐吗？-请坐
-Can l sit down? -Please.



你隶属于哪个教堂？
What church do you belong to?



我...
l...



我不排斥宗教，我没有特别隶属于哪个教堂
l enjoy all faiths. l don't belong
to one church in particular.



我全都爱，全都喜欢。你是从哪来的？
l like them all. l like everything. Where are you from?



那正是我要卖给你的消息
That would be telling you. That's what l want to sell you.



你在西诺丘做什么？
What are you doing in Signal Hill?



我们有油，地上就会渗油
We have oil, and it seeps through the ground.



你想付钱知道地点吗？
Do you want to pay me to know where it is?



地上有油并不代表地下也有
Just 'cause there's something on the ground
doesn't mean there's anything beneath it.



标准石油为什么买上面的地？
Why did Standard Oil buy up land?



这地方在加州？
ls it in California?



-也许吧 -他们买多少地？
-Maybe. -How much land did they buy?



我比较希望你不要把我当笨蛋
l'd like it better if you didn't think l was stupid.



你为什么来找我？
Why did you come to me?



-你才刚挖到油 -没错
-You just brought this well in. -That's right.



所以，现在给我五百元现金
Yes, so just give me $500 in cash right now



我就让你知道地点
and l'll tell you where it is.



这样吧，我现在就给你一百元
l'll tell you what l'll do, son. l'll give you $ 1 00 now,



如果证明那里值得开凿，我就再给你一千元奖金
and if it proves to be a promising lease,
then give you a $ 1,000 bonus.



六百元
Six hundred dollars.



你再告诉我，你们那里有什么
Tell me one thing to help me decide.
What else have you got up there?



你们种什么？
What do you grow?



我们有个大牧场，但大多是石头
We have a big ranch, but it's mostly rocks.



试过种东西，却只长杂草
Plant things. Nothing will grow but weeds.



你以为上面会长什么？
What makes you think it's up?



那里有硫磺吗？还是碱矿？
ls there sulfur around? Or alkali deposits?



附近有碱矿，我不知道硫磺是啥
Alkali nearby. l don't know sulfur.



那是你儿子？
ls that your son?



对
Yes.



- 你好 - 你好
-Hi. -Hi.



-你是谁？-我是费契汉弥顿
-Who are you? -l'm Fletcher Hamilton.



幸会，孩子，你叫什么名字？
Nice to meet you, son. What's your name?



你是做什么的？
What do you do?



我帮普兰优先生做事
l work with Mr. Plainview.



这里有五百元
Here's $500, son.



你告诉我有价值的消息，这钱就是你的了
You tell me something worth hearing, this money's yours.



我来自伊沙贝郡的小波士顿镇
l come from a town called Little Boston in lsabella County.



就是这里。小波士顿有个铁路支线站
This is us, here. Spur station here at Little Boston.



你要找的就是桑德牧场
The Sunday ranch is what you're looking for.



有一条羊肠小径通到那里
There's a sheep trail that takes you there.



由镇上往西走一哩，不远
lt's a mile out of town headed west, not far.



只要走山脚下这条小路
Just through a small pass here near the base of the hills.



你会经过教堂，沿着小径走就行
You'll pass a church and just follow the sheep trail.



-标准石油买下哪里？ -这里和这里
-Where's Standard buying up? -Here and here.



-你姓桑德？ -对
-Your family name is Sunday, yes? -That's right.



你家有多少人？
How many's in your family?



父母、妹妹和我弟弟伊莱
My father and mother and sisters and my brother Eli.



-你有几个妹妹？ -两个
-How many sisters do you have? -Two.



-你叫什么名字？ -保罗
-What's your name? -Paul.



你家人知道石油的存在吗？
Does any of your family know about the oil that you say is there?



我不知道
l don't know.



我叔叔一直说有石油
My uncle always said there was oil there,



但我不知道他们的想法
but l don't know what they heard or what they think.



你们种些什么？
What do you grow?



我们养羊，那是养羊的牧场。我说过，那里只长杂草
lt's goats. lt's a goat farm.
l told you, nothing grows but weeds.



-那里有水吗？ -是咸水
-ls there water? -lt's salty.



只要挖井，出来的几乎都是咸水
You drill a well, it's hard not to get saltwater.



我跟你们说，那里有石油
The oil is there. l'm telling you.



-我想走了 -你可以留下过夜
-l want to go now, so... -You can stay tonight.



-不，我想走了，我要走 -听着，保罗
-No, l want to go now. l want to leave.
-Listen, Paul.



如果我大老远跑去那里，却发现你骗我
lf l travel all the way out there
and l find that you've been lying to me,



我会找到你，拿回加倍的钱
l'm going to find you and l'm going
to take more than my money back.



那样可以吗？
ls that all right with you?



-可以，先生 -那么好吧
-Yes, sir. -All right, then.



-祝你们好运，上帝保佑 -你也是，年轻人
-Nice luck to you. God bless.
-And to you, young man.



有人来了
-There's someone coming. -Thank you, Mary.



-晚安 -晚安
-Good evening. -Good evening.



我叫丹尼尔普兰优，这是我儿子
My name's Daniel Plainview. This is my son, H.W.



-你来打猎的？ -猎鹌鹑
-Are you hunting? -Hunting for quail.



听说桑德牧场附近适合扎营
We're told there might be a good place
to camp up near the Sunday ranch.



这里就是桑德牧场，你可以扎营
This is the Sunday ranch. You can camp here.



-谢谢，你有水吗？ -有的
-Thank you. Do you have water? -Yes.



听说几天前这里有地震
We heard there was an earthquake up here a few days ago.



-真的吗？ -是啊
-ls that right? -Yes.



-家里还好？ -很好，谢谢
-Your family? -Yeah, all fine. Thank you.



-你想喝的话，我们有羊奶 -那太好了
-We have goat's milk, if you'd like.
-That would be fine.



那现在
Now,



如果我们把帐棚架在那里，就不会挡到你们的路了
if we set our tent away over there,
we'd be out of your way over there.



可以
That's fine.



露丝，过来帮忙，拿水给他们
Ruth! Help these men and bring them some water.



不行，H.W
No! H.W.



普兰优先生，你现在想喝羊奶吗？
Mr. Plainview, would you like that milk now?



-好的，谢谢 -玛丽，拿些羊奶来给他们
-That would be fine. Thank you.
-Mary! Bring them some milk.



我的家人会帮你架好你的帐棚
My family will help you set up your tent.



不，我们露营要自己动手
No, please. We set ourselves on this camping trip.



我们自己来架帐棚
We have to do the camping.



动作快
Hurry up!



-你有面包吗？ -我们有马铃薯
-Do you have bread? -We have potatoes.



马铃薯就很好了，谢谢
Potatoes would be nice, thank you.



我会叫她们煮些马铃薯给你们
l'll have them boil you up some potatoes.



没关系，我们可以生火来煮
That's all right. l thought maybe we'd make a fire.



我想跟我儿子一起合作生火
l wanted to work with my son on making a fire.



我儿子伊莱会拿些柴来给你们
All right. My son, Eli, will bring you some wood.



谢谢你盛情的招待，桑德先生
Thank you so much for your hospitality, Mr. Sunday.



-没问题 -我们不会碍事
-Yes. -And we'll be out of your way.



只是来猎鹌鹑
-We're just hunting for quail. -Yes.



-抱歉我们没有面包 -没关系
-l'm sorry we don't have any bread.
-No, no, no.



这里种不出玉米，全是石头
Corn doesn't fill out in the hills here. lt's mostly rock.



我们没地方可以种谷子
We don't have room to raise the grain.



谢谢你，小姐
Thank you, young lady.



我叫伊莱
My name is Eli.



是的，你是...伊莱桑德
Yes, you're Eli Sunday.



欢迎你们
Welcome.



-H.W. -伊莱
-H.W. -Eli.



-你们来猎鹌鹑？ -是的
-You're hunting quail? -That's right.



-我们会拿晚餐过来 -谢谢，真感谢你
-We will bring dinner. -Thank you. Thank you so much.



爸!
Dad!



看我的鞋子
Dad, look at my shoe.



那是地震震出来的油，别激动
That's earthquake oil. Set loose.



所以...
So...



所以？
So?



是啊，所以
So, so.



这里若有油，我们就运到海边
If there's anything here, we take it to the sea.



拉输油管到怀尼米港或圣宝拉
What we do is we build a pipeline
to Port Hueneme or Santa Paula,



大约有一百哩
it's about 100 miles,



我们再跟联合石油谈交易，这一行就是这样
and we do a deal with Union Oil. This is what we do.



之后我们就不需要铁路还有运送成本了
Then we don't need the railroads
and their shipping costs anymore.



懂吧？
You see?



懂
Yeah.



-你懂了？ -我懂
-You see that? -Yeah.



那样我们就能赚钱，赚大钱
Then we're making money. We're making the real money.



那也是我们该赚的
What we should be making. Not just...



不是把赚的钱浪费在运送上
Not just throwing it away on shipping costs.



那样赚的就太少了
Otherwise, it's just mud.



我们要付他们多少？
How much are we going to pay them?



他们是谁？
Who's that?



桑德家
The Sunday family.



我不会给他们油田价
l'm not going to give them oil prices.



我会给他们鹌鹑价
l'll give them quail prices.



我想跟你们谈一下
lf we could take a few minutes,



有件事我想跟你谈谈
there's something l'd very much like to talk with you about.



孩子的妈，带女孩子们出去
Mother, would you take the girls outside, please?



我说话不喜欢拐弯抹角
l believe in plain speaking, so...



这牧场很美，我喜欢猎鹌鹑
This is a beautiful ranch. l love hunting for quail.



我儿子有病，他需要新鲜空气
My boy has been sick, you know. He needs fresh air.



医生说他需要大量的新鲜空气
Doctors all say he needs plentiful fresh air.



那
So,



你想这块地的值多少钱？
what would you say would be
a fair price for this lot, Abel?



-买下这里？ -是的
-To buy this place? -That's right.



想一下
Take a moment.



- 对不起，我不知道 - 一备六元
-l'm sorry. l don't know. -Six dollars an acre.



六元？谢谢，伊莱
Six dollars? Thank you, Eli.



还有加上多年来 用来改良牧场的五百元
And then with the improvements
to the ranch over the years at $500...



我想出三千七买这个牧场
l'd like to offer you $3,700 for this ranch.



-就是三千七百元 -不行
-That's $3,700. -No.



上帝派这人来此，伊莱
The Lord has sent this man here, Eli.



是的，我相信是的
Yes, l believe He has.



-我出价三千七百元 -是什么引你来此的？
-My offer to you is $3,700.
-What is it that brought you here, sir?



万能上帝的指引
The Good Lord's guidance.



当然，之后我们可以租地给你
-Now, of course, within that... -What about our oil?
...we're going to develop a lease.



-你说呢？ -那我们的石油呢？
-What's that? -What about our oil?



什么石油？
What about it?



我们这里有石油，那很值钱
We have oil here. That's worth something.



你们有人会钻探石油？
Do you have someone who can drill for it?



-你认为这里有石油？ -我相信有
-Do you think there's oil here? -l know there is.



钻油费用是很昂贵的
lt's very expensive to drill.



把油从地底弄出来，你试过吗？
To get it up and out of the ground.
You ever tried that before?



-那要多少钱？ -很贵
-How much is it? -Costly.



我们的油在地上就有
Well, our oil sits right up on top of the ground.



我想那是渗出来的
l believe that's called seepage.



并不必然意味底下有东西
Doesn't necessarily mean there's anything underneath.



-你出多少钱买油？ -我不知道
-What would you give us for it? -l don't know.



-你也有不知道的 -是啊
-Something you don't know. -That's right.



你要多少？
What would you like, Eli?



一万
Ten thousand dollars.



为什么？
For what?



为了我的教堂
For my church.



有趣
That's good.



真是有趣
That's a good one.



那
Well...



要是我们决定钻探石油，若油井量产
lf we decide to drill for oil and if the well begins to produce,



我就给你的教堂五千元的签约金
l'll give your church a $5,000 signing bonus.



一万
Ten thousand.



你想找别人来这里钻油？
Do you want to find someone else
that's going to come here and drill, Eli?



找别人投资兼做苦工？
Make the investment and do
all the hard work that goes into it?



我去别的牧场也能猎鹌鹑
l can just as easily hunt for quail
on another ranch as l can here, so...



虽然我很乐意支持你的教堂
Though l'll happily be a supporter
of your church for as long as l can.



只有红利
For the bonus only.



很巧的是，我刚好在钻油业有认识人
Now, as it happens, l do have some
connections in the drilling business



他们也许能帮我们起头。你觉得如何，亚伯？
who might help get us started.
How do you feel about this, Abel?



好，伊莱说什么都好
Yes. What Eli says.



很好，我们先签个约来试试
Well, good! Let's draw up
some contracts and let's... Let's give it a try.



多谢你的帮忙，伊莱
Appreciate your help with this, Eli.



-午安 -午安
-Good afternoon. -Good afternoon.



-仲介？-对
-Real estate? -Yes.



是的，我想跟你谈谈
Yes, l'd like to talk to you.



我在找土地，我刚买下桑德牧场
l'm looking for some land. l just bought the Sunday ranch.



然后...地图在哪？
And, well, where's the map?



桑德牧场后的丘陵地在哪？
Where are the hills behind the Sunday ranch?



在这里，那是班迪的地。他有六百多备
That's here. lt's the Bandy tract. He has over 600 acres.



班迪，六百备
Bandy, 600.



-这里呢？ -毛德、布洛杰、瑞狄、卡尔
-What about this?
-A.C. Maude, Blodget, Redlick, Carr.



-现在的地租多少？ -一备六元
-What's it held at? -Six dollars an acre.



六元
Six.

北文家的，那很好买，我保证
That's the Belvins', and that could be got, l'm sure.



这附近的地都能买下吗？
Can everything around here be got?



行
Sure.



保罗桑德成了我们的好朋友
Paul Sunday turned out to be a good friend of ours.



没错
That's right.



你尽快赶到这里，把佛雷英格带来
Well, you get here just as soon

-Passing through. Looking around.



-看到你真怪 -是很怪，不是吗？
-Funny to see you. -Funny, isn't it?



你们是标准的家族事业
You boys are a regular family business.



你们来的有点晚了
You boys are a little late.



-你找到什么了？ -我找到一些有趣的东西
-What did you find?
-l found some interesting prospects.



听说标准石油买地了？
Did you hear Standard bought up?



-大多是北边的地 -我听说的也是
-Mostly in the north, so far.
-That's what l hear.



金，如果你想买地，往东去
l'm gonna tell you, Gene,
if you're gonna make a play, look east.



我宁可是你买下那里。这附近的地都被买下了
l'd rather it be you than someone else.
This mud around here has been taken.



有这个小帅哥在身边，谈买卖一定更顺利
lt must be easy when you have such
a cute face to carry around with you.



-你是想说我儿子很帅？ -正是
-Telling me how handsome my son is?
-Well, that l am.



你真好，谢谢，祝你好运
That's very nice. Thank you. Good luck, Gene.



-保重 -我说过，往东边去
-Take care. -Like l said, go east.

他们是帮我们工作的人
They're just guys that are working for us.



他们只是四处看看
They're just looking around.



我们能赚多少钱？
How much money can we make?



不知道，要看情况
l don't know. lt depends.



一千元？
One thousand dollars?



玛丽说若她不祷告，她爸就打她

他说他想跟收买土地的人谈

Ladies and gentlemen.



谢谢你们今晚大驾光临
Thank you so much for visiting with us this evening.



我跨越了大半的北达克达州来到这里，来看看这块土地
Now, l've traveled across half our state
to be here and to see about this land.



我敢说你们有人可能听说过
Now, I daresay some of you might have heard



一些更夸张的谣言，传说我有些什么计划
some of the more extravagant rumors
about what my plans are,



我只是认为你们该亲耳听我说
so I just thought you'd like to hear it from me.



就是这张脸，没什么神秘的
This is the face. It's no great mystery.



我是个石油商人，各位
I'm an oilman, ladies and gentlemen,



我对许多地方都有兴趣
I have numerous concerns spread across this state.



我有很多油井每天产出数千桶油
I have many wells flowing
at many thousand barrels per day,



所以我认为我是个石油商
so I like to think of myself as an oilman.



身为石油商
As an oilman, I hope that you'll forgive



我希望各位原谅我有话直说
just good old-fashioned plain speaking.



我们做的是家族事业
Now, this work that we do
is very much a family enterprise.



我跟我儿子H.W.携手合作
I work side by side with my wonderful son, H. W.



我想你们有人可能见过他了
I think one or two of you might have met him already.



我也鼓励我的手下带家人一起来
And I encourage my men to bring their families, as well.



当然，这么做有助于促进他们获得更有价值的人生
Of course, it makes for an ever
so much more rewarding life for them.



家庭代表孩子，孩子代表教育
Family means children, and children means education.



所以，不管我们落脚何处，教育是必要的
So, wherever we set up camp, education is a necessity,



我们也很高兴能满足需求
and we're just so happy to take care of that.



让我们在小波士顿造一间学校
So let's build a wonderful school in Little Boston.



这些孩子是我们努力的未来
These children are the future that we strive for,



所以他们也该拥有最好的
and so they should have the very best of things.



现在，还有一件事
Now, something else,



请别误会我有侮蔑的意思：面包
and please don't be insulted
if l speak about this. Bread.



我们来谈谈面包吧
Let's talk about bread.



在我看来，我很讨厌去想到
Now, to my mind, it's an abomination to consider



有任何男人、女人、或小孩，在我们这个伟大的国家里
that any man, woman, or child
in this magnificent country of ours



竟然将一条面包视为是奢侈品
should have to look upon a loaf of bread as a luxury.



我们要在这里挖水井，而水井就代表灌溉
We're going to dig water wells here,
and water wells means irrigation.



灌溉就意味着耕种
Irrigation means cultivation.



我们要在这里种谷子，在这之前一片荒芜的土地上
We're going to raise crops here where
before it just simply wasn't possible.



你们会有更多的谷子可以运用
You're going to have more grain
than you'll know what to do with,



面包会多到你吃不完，夫人
and bread will be coming right out of your ears, ma'am.



新的道路、农业、就业、教育
New roads, agriculture, employment, education.



这些只是改进的一小部份
These are just a few of the things we can offer you,



各位，我向你们保证
and l assure you, ladies and gentlemen,



若我们真在此找到石油
that if we do find oil here,



我想我们很有可能会找到
and l think there's a very good chance that we will,



你们的社区将不再贫瘠，它将兴隆繁盛
this community of yours
will not only survive, it will flourish.



我很乐意回答任何问题，请说？
l'd be happy to answer any questions
that you might have. Yes?



新的道路会通往教堂吗？
Will the new road lead to the church?



那会是第一个通往的地方。谢谢你，伊莱，还有谁？
That'll be the first place that it leads.
Thank you, Eli. Anyone else?



如果有任何事，我很容易找的
Well, if anything comes up, l'm pretty easy to find.



你们随时可以来找我
You just come visit with me.



谢谢各位宝贵的时间，晚安
Thank you so much for your time, and good night.

“何等权利能将万事”

-丹尼尔，我能跟你谈谈吗？ -可以，请进

有什么需要我帮忙的吗？
ls there anything that you need from me?



-任何教堂能帮得上的忙？ -我想没有，谢谢
-Anything the church can do for you?
-l don't believe so. No. Thank you.



我知道你明天邀请大家
l understand you've asked the people to gather around



来此观看开井仪式
and watch the well begin tomorrow. ls that right?



- 是 - 我会为这口井祈福
-That's right. -l will bless the well.



在你开始之前，你该介绍我
Before you begin, you should introduce me.



你会看到我走向油井，然后...
You'll see me walk up
towards the oil well, and when l...



是油井塔
The derrick.



你会看到我走出来，然后你可以说出我的名字
You'll see me walk up,
and then you could say my name.



你走出来？
When you walk up?



对，你会看到我走出来，然后你可以说...
Yes. You'll see me walk up,
and then you could say,



“看顾上帝子民的本土之子”
''The proud son of these hills
who tended his Father's flock,''



然后你可以说出我的名字
and then you could say my name.



很好
That's fine.



-接着会怎样？ -接着我们就开始钻油
-And what happens then?
-Well, then we start the drill.



这是简单的祈福，不过却很重要
lt's a simple blessing, Daniel, but an important one.



只有几句话，不会太久
lt's just a few words. lt won't take long.



-什么时候？ -你们什么时候方便？
-What time? -What time's good for you, Eli?



-四点 -那就四点吧
-4:00. -Well, let's make it 4:00 then.



-很感谢你来访 -祝你愉快，谢谢

l've had the pleasure of meeting some of you



希望接下来的日子里
and l hope very much in the months to come,



我能拜访你们每一个人
l'll be able to visit with each and every one of you.



我擅长钻凿却不善演说
l'm better at digging holes in the
ground than making speeches,



所以今晚略过演说
so let's forget the speech for this evening,



直接祈祷吧
just make it a simple blessing.



要明白，钻油不能只靠一个人
You see, one man doesn't prospect from the ground.



这要靠一整个社区的善良百姓，像各位
lt takes a whole community of
good people, such as yourselves,



而这很不错，我们齐聚一堂
and this is good. We stay together.



我们一起祷告、工作
We pray together, we work together,



若上帝对我们的努力微笑以待
and if the Good Lord smiles kindly on our endeavor,



我们就共享财富
we share in the wealth together.



在玛丽一号井开工前
Now, before we spud in Mary's Well Number One,



这井以我身旁的玛丽桑德命名
named for the lovely
Miss Mary Sunday, here by my side,



在地的本土之女
a proud daughter of these hills,



我想说，上帝保佑真诚的工人，当然，还有
l'd just like to say God bless these
honest labors of ours, and, of course,



上帝保佑各位
God bless you all.



阿门

中午以前停工

And l had a vision. Yes, last night, l had a vision



我感觉到上帝的气息贯穿我
and l felt God's breath move through me.



沉入我的胃
And it rolled down into my stomach.



它劈啪作响
lt sloshed around.



我的胃低语着，不是呐喊
And my stomach spoke in a whisper, not a shout,



“用手抚摸这位女士并抚慰她”
''Touch this woman with your hands
and caress her.'' Yes.



亲爱的杭特太太
My dear Mrs. Hunter,



你有关节炎，对吧？
you have arthritis, don't you?



-是的，伊莱 -好
-Yes, l do, Eli. -Yes.



恶魔在你手上，我会把它拉出来
The devil is in your hands, and l will suck it out.



我不会激动的把这恶魔扔出去
Now, l will not cast this ghost out with a fever



因为在我体内的神灵告诉我，我有新的沟通方法
for the new spirit inside me has shown
me l have a new way to communicate.



就是轻柔的低语
lt is a gentle whisper.



离开吧，恶鬼
Get out of here, ghost.



离开这里，恶鬼
Get out of here, ghost.



离开
Get out.



离开这里，恶鬼

丹尼尔，这场意外原本可以避免
Daniel, this accident could have been avoided.



那口井真令人遗憾
lt is terrible to think of that well



- 他们连续工作... - 这些人轮12小时的班
-working away out there...
-These men work in 12-hour shifts.



-没有获得祈福 -他们需要休息
-...unblessed. -They need their rest.



没休息，就会犯错
lf they don't have it,
they start to make stupid mistakes.



我看过他们喝酒
l've seen the men drinking.



那有关系吗？
Don't you think that has something to do with this?



这些人需要好好休息
We need these men well-rested to bring in this well.



如果他们听你讲道就不能休息
They can't get that if they're up here
listening to your gospel,



油井就没办法产油...更没办法让大家发财
and then the well can't produce
and blow gold all over the place.



我真希望跟乔多相处些时日
l wish l had more time with Joe Gundha.



该多做些什么的
More could have been done.



那么那口井就不能产油，也不能让大家发财
Then the well can't produce
and blow gold all over the place.

送还给他的家人，好吗？

你何时要来让我儿子恢复听力？
When are you coming over and make my son hear again?



你做不到？
Can't you do that?
