00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,027
"Do you think it'd be fun
if we got married?"

3
00:00:28,037 --> 00:00:29,627
And what did you say?

4
00:00:29,637 --> 00:00:31,637
I took her up on it.

5
00:00:31,652 --> 00:00:34,458
I never wanted to be
away from her.

6
00:00:34,468 --> 00:00:36,678
She had the spark of life.

7
00:01:58,373 --> 00:02:00,373
Careful.

8
00:02:02,821 --> 00:02:05,711
When did we last
wash that sweater?

9
00:02:07,045 --> 00:02:09,045
Right after the war.

10
00:02:13,861 --> 00:02:14,811
Christmas.

11
00:02:14,821 --> 00:02:16,411
In the '50s sometime or the '60s.

12
00:02:16,421 --> 00:02:18,421
Shut up.

13
00:02:47,749 --> 00:02:49,749
I'll go make the fire.

14
00:03:24,165 --> 00:03:26,458
"You climbed the bank and said,

15
00:03:26,468 --> 00:03:29,469
"'This is how you touch
other women,

16
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:33,562
"the grass cutter's wife,
the lime burner's daughter.

17
00:03:33,572 --> 00:03:35,034
"And you searched your arms

18
00:03:35,044 --> 00:03:36,762
for the missing perfume
and knew..."

19
00:03:36,772 --> 00:03:39,326
Don't worry, darling.

20
00:03:39,396 --> 00:03:42,201
I expect I'm just losing my mind.

21
00:03:44,101 --> 00:03:47,227
"What good is it to be
the lime burner's daughter,

22
00:03:47,237 --> 00:03:49,083
"left with no trace

23
00:03:49,093 --> 00:03:51,771
"as if not spoken to in the act of love,

24
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:56,450
"as if wounded without
the pleasure of a scar.

25
00:03:56,517 --> 00:03:59,067
"You touched your belly
to my hands in the dry air

26
00:03:59,077 --> 00:04:03,812
"and said, 'I am
the cinnamon peeler's wife.

27
00:04:03,877 --> 00:04:05,877
Smell me.'"

28
00:05:07,013 --> 00:05:10,974
When I look away,
I forget what yellow means.

29
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:13,434
But I can look again.

30
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:17,675
Sometimes there's something
delicious in oblivion.

31
00:05:17,733 --> 00:05:19,931
I think you're supposed to be able

32
00:05:19,941 --> 00:05:23,451
to put your fingers
inside the curled petal

33
00:05:23,461 --> 00:05:25,982
and feel the heat.

34
00:05:26,053 --> 00:05:28,053
Well?

35
00:05:30,438 --> 00:05:32,893
I can't be sure.

36
00:05:32,964 --> 00:05:35,643
I can't be sure if what I can feel

37
00:05:35,653 --> 00:05:39,231
is the heat or my imagination.

38
00:05:40,933 --> 00:05:43,228
The heat attracts the bugs.

39
00:05:44,805 --> 00:05:48,800
Nature never fools around
just being decorative.

40
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:23,995
Yes?

41
00:06:24,005 --> 00:06:26,107
I don't quite know
how to introduce myself.

42
00:06:26,117 --> 00:06:29,729
I used to see your husband
at Meadowlake.

43
00:06:29,798 --> 00:06:32,773
I'm a regular visitor there myself.

44
00:06:36,678 --> 00:06:38,803
Those are lovely flowers.

45
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:43,390
I've never seen
those purple ones before.

46
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:48,600
The earth there must
really appeal to them.

47
00:06:53,445 --> 00:06:54,396
What?

48
00:06:54,406 --> 00:06:56,668
You could just open the drawers.

49
00:06:56,678 --> 00:06:57,851
Remind yourself.

50
00:06:57,861 --> 00:06:59,100
What?

51
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,870
Maybe all the labels and lists
are defeating the purpose.

52
00:07:04,262 --> 00:07:07,003
If you stopped thinking about things
the moment you write them down,

53
00:07:07,013 --> 00:07:11,454
maybe that's the end
of your need to recall.

54
00:07:11,526 --> 00:07:13,852
I heard a story at a dinner party

55
00:07:13,862 --> 00:07:15,931
about the German soldiers
on border patrol

56
00:07:15,941 --> 00:07:19,040
in Czechoslovakia during the war.

57
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,339
I heard it from that
Czech student of yours.

58
00:07:21,349 --> 00:07:22,748
Veronica.

59
00:07:22,758 --> 00:07:25,758
We spoke once at a dinner party.

60
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:28,034
Don't be nervous.

61
00:07:28,102 --> 00:07:30,338
It's a good story.

62
00:07:30,405 --> 00:07:34,878
She told me that each
of the German patrol dogs

63
00:07:34,949 --> 00:07:38,627
<i>wore a sign saying "hund."</i>

64
00:07:38,694 --> 00:07:40,412
"Why?" said the Czechs.

65
00:07:40,422 --> 00:07:45,691
And the Germans replied,
"Because that is a hund."

66
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:06,171
It was one of those craft shows

67
00:08:06,181 --> 00:08:09,083
where you look around and wonder
that the laws of supply and demand

68
00:08:09,093 --> 00:08:12,060
can allow for the production
of so many macramÃ© ducks.

69
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,755
Oh, God, those things are everywhere.

70
00:08:13,765 --> 00:08:16,604
- What do you do with them?
- Come on, Phoebe, you've got one of those.

71
00:08:16,614 --> 00:08:18,428
You use it as a... what do you call it...

72
00:08:18,438 --> 00:08:19,804
a light fixture holder or som...

73
00:08:19,814 --> 00:08:21,180
- I do not.
- Phoebe, in the...

74
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,747
Oh, yes. Wait a second, I do.

75
00:08:22,757 --> 00:08:24,380
Fiona gave it to me.

76
00:08:24,390 --> 00:08:26,659
Yes, I did.

77
00:08:27,814 --> 00:08:30,279
Would anybody like some more?

78
00:08:41,157 --> 00:08:43,157
Ween...

79
00:08:48,134 --> 00:08:51,811
Wai... Wain...

80
00:08:51,878 --> 00:08:53,916
No, but I'll have a touch of wine.

81
00:08:53,926 --> 00:08:55,292
Yeah, Fiona, that would be lovely.

82
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:57,302
Some more wain.

83
00:09:00,518 --> 00:09:02,518
The thing is...

84
00:09:04,486 --> 00:09:06,951
half the time I wander around

85
00:09:06,982 --> 00:09:11,587
looking for something
which I know is very pertinent.

86
00:09:11,654 --> 00:09:14,620
I can't remember what it is.

87
00:09:16,326 --> 00:09:20,963
Once the idea is gone,
everything is gone.

88
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:24,321
I just wander around

89
00:09:24,389 --> 00:09:29,659
trying to figure out what it was
that was so important earlier.

90
00:09:32,358 --> 00:09:35,774
I think I may be
beginning to disappear.

91
00:09:43,622 --> 00:09:45,596
And what year is it?

92
00:09:45,606 --> 00:09:47,259
2003.

93
00:09:47,269 --> 00:09:52,540
Fiona, if you found a letter on the street,
addressed, with a stamp on it,

94
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,492
what would you do with it?

95
00:09:54,502 --> 00:09:55,740
I'd mail it.

96
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,980
And where would you put it to mail it?

97
00:10:08,966 --> 00:10:12,219
And if there was a fire
in a movie theater,

98
00:10:12,229 --> 00:10:15,803
and you were the first person
to spot that fire,

99
00:10:15,813 --> 00:10:17,813
what would you do?

100
00:10:20,678 --> 00:10:22,587
Well, we don't go
to the movies much anymore,

101
00:10:22,597 --> 00:10:24,220
do we, Grant?

102
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:28,905
All those multiplexes showing
the same American garbage.

103
00:10:39,655 --> 00:10:41,532
Have you seen my coat?

104
00:10:41,542 --> 00:10:43,484
There it is, dear.

105
00:10:43,494 --> 00:10:45,494
It's on your chair.

106
00:10:46,918 --> 00:10:47,868
Oh, yes.

107
00:10:47,878 --> 00:10:51,131
Fiona, would you mind
if I asked you a few more questions?

108
00:10:51,141 --> 00:10:53,630
Would you mind taking a seat?

109
00:10:55,879 --> 00:10:59,619
I was just feeling
a little cold, that's all.

110
00:11:09,062 --> 00:11:11,550
What an ugly baby.

111
00:11:27,782 --> 00:11:30,300
When did we move into this cottage?

112
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:33,758
Was it last year
or the year before?

113
00:11:42,663 --> 00:11:44,509
No. It was longer than that.

114
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,409
It was when I left the university,

115
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,430
20 years ago.

116
00:11:55,175 --> 00:11:57,892
Well, that's shocking.

117
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:13,507
Let's just see how it goes, shall we?

118
00:12:15,687 --> 00:12:18,404
How is your husband doing?

119
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:19,964
Okay.

120
00:12:19,974 --> 00:12:23,933
He and my wife struck up
quite a close friendship.

121
00:12:23,943 --> 00:12:25,943
I heard about that.

122
00:12:26,951 --> 00:12:28,924
So, uh,

123
00:12:28,934 --> 00:12:32,334
I'd like to speak to you
about something.

124
00:12:33,254 --> 00:12:35,326
If you have a minute.

125
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:38,173
My husband did not try
to start anything with your wife,

126
00:12:38,183 --> 00:12:39,580
if that's what you're getting at.

127
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:41,340
He did not try to molest her.

128
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:42,812
He's incapable of it.

129
00:12:42,822 --> 00:12:44,252
And anyway, he wouldn't.

130
00:12:44,262 --> 00:12:47,196
From what I hear, it was the other way around.

131
00:12:47,206 --> 00:12:49,148
No, uh, that isn't it at all.

132
00:12:49,158 --> 00:12:52,413
I didn't come here with any complaints.

133
00:12:52,423 --> 00:12:54,561
Oh.

134
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,860
Oh, well, I'm sorry.
I thought you did.

135
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:01,821
Maybe you should come in.

136
00:13:01,831 --> 00:13:05,725
It's not as warm a day as it looks.

137
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:15,357
"Never let a person make you feel guilty
for your anger with God."

138
00:13:15,367 --> 00:13:17,952
Hmm. Random.

139
00:13:20,486 --> 00:13:23,748
I can't even see what the point is.

140
00:13:23,815 --> 00:13:26,881
We can't be certain this is what...

141
00:13:26,951 --> 00:13:28,285
You're far too young.

142
00:13:28,295 --> 00:13:30,013
"Should the patient
afflicted with the disease

143
00:13:30,023 --> 00:13:32,641
"remain at home...

144
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:36,536
the caregiver will very often be the spouse."

145
00:13:37,766 --> 00:13:40,221
"The caregiver must preside
over the degeneration

146
00:13:40,231 --> 00:13:42,748
"of someone he or she
loves very much,

147
00:13:42,758 --> 00:13:44,444
"must do this for years and years

148
00:13:44,454 --> 00:13:47,101
"with the news always
getting worse, not better,

149
00:13:47,111 --> 00:13:48,892
"must put up sometimes
with deranged

150
00:13:48,902 --> 00:13:51,837
"but at the same time
very personal insults,

151
00:13:51,847 --> 00:13:54,236
"and must somehow learn
to smile through it all.

152
00:13:54,246 --> 00:13:55,805
"Caregivers must be able to diagnose

153
00:13:55,815 --> 00:13:57,916
"a wide variety of ordinary ailments

154
00:13:57,926 --> 00:13:59,869
"under extraordinary circumstances.

155
00:13:59,879 --> 00:14:02,077
"Imagine the person
you love the most

156
00:14:02,087 --> 00:14:03,676
"suddenly upset about something,

157
00:14:03,686 --> 00:14:05,885
"but completely unable
to communicate the problem

158
00:14:05,895 --> 00:14:08,862
or even to understand it himself."

159
00:14:12,007 --> 00:14:14,642
Sounds like a regular marriage.

160
00:16:45,863 --> 00:16:47,863
Hello, there!

161
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,388
Oh!

162
00:16:51,398 --> 00:16:53,398
Hello, there.

163
00:17:39,143 --> 00:17:41,926
We are at that stage, Grant.

164
00:17:44,743 --> 00:17:46,848
We are at that stage.

165
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:58,167
Well...

166
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:03,268
if we do think of it...

167
00:18:03,334 --> 00:18:06,237
if we do...

168
00:18:06,312 --> 00:18:11,047
then it must be as something
that isn't permanent.

169
00:18:12,967 --> 00:18:17,637
A kind of experimental treatment or...

170
00:18:19,367 --> 00:18:22,563
a rest cure of sorts.

171
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:35,778
All right.

172
00:18:35,847 --> 00:18:36,925
All right.

173
00:18:36,935 --> 00:18:39,520
We can think of it that way.

174
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:47,253
We have to sit in the kitchen,
where I can hear Aubrey.

175
00:18:52,871 --> 00:18:55,806
Well, you might as well
have a cup of coffee.

176
00:18:55,816 --> 00:18:57,693
Thank you.

177
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:03,333
My son put him on the Sports Channel
a year ago Christmas.

178
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,373
I don't know what we'd do without it.

179
00:19:05,383 --> 00:19:07,383
Must be a struggle.

180
00:19:08,648 --> 00:19:10,494
Well, you know.

181
00:19:10,504 --> 00:19:13,253
You know what
struggle is by now.

182
00:19:15,719 --> 00:19:18,054
- You're sure?
- I'm sure.

183
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:23,550
You don't want to just get
a sense of the place?

184
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:26,960
I don't want to make
this decision alone.

185
00:19:29,607 --> 00:19:31,607
What place?

186
00:19:35,112 --> 00:19:37,112
Just kidding!

187
00:19:37,704 --> 00:19:39,704
Fuck off.

188
00:19:46,823 --> 00:19:50,598
You're not making
this decision alone, Grant.

189
00:19:50,664 --> 00:19:53,129
I've already made up my mind.

190
00:19:58,024 --> 00:20:00,024
Okay.

191
00:20:27,591 --> 00:20:29,502
It's time to go home now.

192
00:20:29,512 --> 00:20:31,165
- No, no.
- Mrs. Taylor...

193
00:20:31,175 --> 00:20:32,957
- Hi. Is this your son?
- Yeah. I'm her son.

194
00:20:32,967 --> 00:20:35,934
Hi. I'm Betty. It's time for your bath.

195
00:20:35,944 --> 00:20:38,016
- Bath.
- Yeah.

196
00:20:38,088 --> 00:20:39,677
You have to have a bath now.

197
00:20:39,687 --> 00:20:41,373
Mama.

198
00:20:41,383 --> 00:20:44,094
Mr. Andersson?
Madeleine Montpelier.

199
00:20:44,104 --> 00:20:46,014
- I'm the supervisor here at Meadowlake.
- Hi, there.

200
00:20:46,024 --> 00:20:48,862
I'm just going to take you
on the quick tour of the facility,

201
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:51,389
and then we can sit down
and discuss Mrs. Andersson's condition

202
00:20:51,399 --> 00:20:54,969
and the appropriate time
for admitting her.

203
00:20:57,128 --> 00:20:59,325
As you can see,
we get a lot of natural light.

204
00:20:59,335 --> 00:21:01,669
Yes, I can see that.

205
00:21:01,736 --> 00:21:03,453
This is my favorite room.

206
00:21:03,463 --> 00:21:05,054
Look, over there, as you can see,

207
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:06,878
they have a puzzle on the go.

208
00:21:06,888 --> 00:21:08,253
They always have
a puzzle on the go.

209
00:21:08,263 --> 00:21:10,589
- This works.
- You know, it's real important to us here

210
00:21:10,599 --> 00:21:13,022
that our residents
maintain social function,

211
00:21:13,032 --> 00:21:15,325
so a lot of our activities
and our whole layout

212
00:21:15,335 --> 00:21:16,413
is really geared toward...

213
00:21:16,423 --> 00:21:18,013
Hello, there, Miss Madeleine.

214
00:21:18,023 --> 00:21:19,998
Hello, Michael.

215
00:21:20,008 --> 00:21:21,918
Now, as you can see,
we're coming into our common room,

216
00:21:21,928 --> 00:21:24,702
and again, we're really emphasizing
everybody being social.

217
00:21:24,712 --> 00:21:26,078
So you can bring the family.

218
00:21:26,088 --> 00:21:27,422
Everybody can come and visit.

219
00:21:27,432 --> 00:21:29,758
We have a state-of-the-art
entertainment system

220
00:21:29,768 --> 00:21:32,222
so the residents can gather
and watch together.

221
00:21:32,232 --> 00:21:33,886
- Hi, Madeleine.
- Hello, ladies.

222
00:21:33,896 --> 00:21:35,934
- Hello, Madeleine.
- I got a Christmas sweater.

223
00:21:35,944 --> 00:21:37,821
Aren't you festive!

224
00:21:37,831 --> 00:21:42,142
And this is our quiet corner
for crafts and reading and reflection.

225
00:21:42,152 --> 00:21:45,726
We have a lot of activities
for physical activity.

226
00:21:45,736 --> 00:21:48,704
Balloon badminton and sit and fit.

227
00:21:48,776 --> 00:21:51,934
And here we have our
lovely new dining room.

228
00:21:51,944 --> 00:21:55,549
We can accommodate
any dietary preferences or restrictions.

229
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:59,293
We're just serving up a little Christmas dinner
early for the families.

230
00:21:59,303 --> 00:22:01,214
The old Meadowlake is just next door,

231
00:22:01,224 --> 00:22:04,189
and that's a day center
now, but, um...

232
00:22:04,199 --> 00:22:06,078
this for the permanent residents.

233
00:22:06,088 --> 00:22:07,454
This is brand-spanking new.

234
00:22:07,464 --> 00:22:10,099
So let's go upstairs, shall we?

235
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:14,306
Just taking my tea for a ride.

236
00:22:15,272 --> 00:22:18,120
Oh, look at this one, Flo.

237
00:22:18,185 --> 00:22:20,478
He's a real charmer, isn't he?

238
00:22:20,488 --> 00:22:23,203
Would you say,
are you a charmer?

239
00:22:23,213 --> 00:22:25,213
I think you could say
I was kind of a charmer.

240
00:22:25,223 --> 00:22:27,427
You're a rascal.

241
00:22:27,496 --> 00:22:29,791
Mr. Andersson is here about his wife, Eliza.
Behave yourself.

242
00:22:29,801 --> 00:22:32,005
I should have known it.

243
00:22:32,072 --> 00:22:34,461
At this age, it's...

244
00:22:35,784 --> 00:22:38,270
What do the kids call it, Flo? It's...

245
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:40,320
It's a real clusterfuck.

246
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,430
All the charmers are taken.

247
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,709
Or dead. Mostly dead.

248
00:22:44,776 --> 00:22:48,191
You're kind of charming
yourself, sweetheart.

249
00:22:48,201 --> 00:22:50,201
Shall we?

250
00:22:57,608 --> 00:23:00,159
This is our second floor,
the extended care wing.

251
00:23:00,169 --> 00:23:01,374
The elevators, of course,

252
00:23:01,384 --> 00:23:02,494
have the lockdown system,

253
00:23:02,504 --> 00:23:04,574
and this is where
the patients can move to

254
00:23:04,584 --> 00:23:06,558
once they become more progressed.

255
00:23:06,568 --> 00:23:09,219
Interesting choice of words.

256
00:23:09,288 --> 00:23:12,318
Why don't I show you some of the rooms here,
while we're at it?

257
00:23:12,328 --> 00:23:14,430
Then we can go back down
and see the regular rooms

258
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,775
where Mrs. Andersson will be living.

259
00:23:15,785 --> 00:23:18,047
No, that will not be necessary.

260
00:23:18,057 --> 00:23:20,223
My wife will not be
progressing to this floor.

261
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,469
All right.

262
00:23:24,008 --> 00:23:25,342
Who chooses the music?

263
00:23:25,352 --> 00:23:26,814
I'm sorry?

264
00:23:26,824 --> 00:23:28,190
I'm assuming it's not the residents.

265
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:31,345
I don't see any of them
singing along.

266
00:23:31,401 --> 00:23:34,910
Yeah, well. You know the rooms on the regular
floors all have their own stereo systems

267
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,054
so the patients can listen
to whatever they like.

268
00:23:37,064 --> 00:23:39,064
How kind.

269
00:23:40,008 --> 00:23:43,294
Now, we don't admit anyone
during the month of December,

270
00:23:43,304 --> 00:23:45,279
so Mrs. Andersson will
have to wait till January

271
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:47,166
to make the big move.

272
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:51,551
Just December, Christmas, you know, too
many emotional pitfalls.

273
00:23:51,561 --> 00:23:53,214
- Right.
- Sorry to interrupt, Madeleine.

274
00:23:53,224 --> 00:23:54,942
I'm looking for those documents
on Aubrey Burke.

275
00:23:54,952 --> 00:23:56,510
Sure. Go ahead.

276
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:59,550
Mr. Andersson, this is Kristy,
our new managing nurse.

277
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,791
Against some people's
better judgment.

278
00:24:01,801 --> 00:24:03,801
Now, now.

279
00:24:03,816 --> 00:24:05,887
Mr. Andersson is here about his wife,
Mrs. Andersson,

280
00:24:05,897 --> 00:24:07,326
who will be joining us in January.

281
00:24:07,336 --> 00:24:08,446
- Hi, there.
- Hi.

282
00:24:08,456 --> 00:24:09,535
We also have a policy,

283
00:24:09,545 --> 00:24:11,038
which I'm sure you saw
in the brochure,

284
00:24:11,048 --> 00:24:12,894
that our new residents
are not allowed visitors

285
00:24:12,904 --> 00:24:14,910
or receiving phone calls
during the first 30 days,

286
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,766
just to give them a chance to settle in.

287
00:24:16,776 --> 00:24:18,776
What sort of visitors?

288
00:24:21,928 --> 00:24:24,563
Everyone. Even close relatives.

289
00:24:24,585 --> 00:24:26,078
I couldn't just leave her here.

290
00:24:26,088 --> 00:24:28,319
We understand,
it is very difficult

291
00:24:28,329 --> 00:24:31,007
to leave a loved one
in a new environment for so long,

292
00:24:31,017 --> 00:24:34,270
but most people need
that time to settle in.

293
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,030
Before we had this rule in place,

294
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:37,694
residents would forget
again and again

295
00:24:37,704 --> 00:24:39,166
why they were being left here.

296
00:24:39,176 --> 00:24:40,318
Whereas we find,

297
00:24:40,328 --> 00:24:42,942
you give them the month
to settle in,

298
00:24:42,952 --> 00:24:45,022
and they're happy as clams.

299
00:24:45,032 --> 00:24:50,398
And after that, a little visit home
every now and then, perfectly fine.

300
00:24:50,408 --> 00:24:53,638
We'll take good care
of her, I promise.

301
00:24:56,809 --> 00:24:59,039
- Knock-knock.
- Oh, no! Not again.

302
00:24:59,049 --> 00:25:02,048
Knock-knock. Boo.

303
00:25:09,801 --> 00:25:11,838
- She's bringing two babies.
- Two babies?

304
00:25:11,848 --> 00:25:14,993
She's got a new baby,
four months old.

305
00:27:56,425 --> 00:27:58,425
Smells good.

306
00:28:00,201 --> 00:28:03,647
I was going to go for a ski,
but I thought I shouldn't chance it,

307
00:28:03,657 --> 00:28:05,983
what with the Alzheimer's and all.

308
00:28:05,993 --> 00:28:07,199
Why didn't you wake me?

309
00:28:07,209 --> 00:28:09,209
What are these, Grant?

310
00:28:17,961 --> 00:28:20,639
Those are the documents
you're supposed to sign

311
00:28:20,649 --> 00:28:23,455
if you decide to go to Meadowlake.

312
00:28:23,465 --> 00:28:25,440
That is exactly
what I have decided.

313
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:28,223
You were to go and sign these
and leave them there.

314
00:28:28,233 --> 00:28:32,143
I wouldn't be allowed
to visit you for 30 days.

315
00:28:38,601 --> 00:28:44,003
30 days isn't such a long time
after 44 years.

316
00:28:44,073 --> 00:28:46,708
I don't think I like the place.

317
00:28:50,024 --> 00:28:55,426
I don't think we should be looking
for something we like, Grant.

318
00:28:55,497 --> 00:28:58,472
I don't think we'll ever find that.

319
00:28:59,784 --> 00:29:02,431
I think all we can aspire
to in this situation

320
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:04,897
is a little bit of grace.

321
00:29:47,273 --> 00:29:50,758
I suppose I'll be
dressed up all the time.

322
00:29:51,849 --> 00:29:56,421
It will be sort of like... in a hotel.

323
00:30:00,682 --> 00:30:01,984
How do I look?

324
00:30:01,994 --> 00:30:03,167
Just like always.

325
00:30:03,177 --> 00:30:04,863
Just as you've always looked.

326
00:30:04,873 --> 00:30:06,873
And how does that look?

327
00:30:09,130 --> 00:30:11,130
Direct and vague...

328
00:30:12,457 --> 00:30:14,629
sweet and ironic.

329
00:30:20,264 --> 00:30:22,264
Is that how I look?

330
00:30:34,537 --> 00:30:36,708
Oh. Remember?

331
00:30:39,369 --> 00:30:41,215
Surprised, Grant?

332
00:30:41,225 --> 00:30:42,687
No, I'm not surprised.

333
00:30:42,697 --> 00:30:46,013
I'm just grateful
you can remember that.

334
00:30:46,089 --> 00:30:48,959
I'm not all gone, Grant. Just...

335
00:30:49,033 --> 00:30:51,270
going...

336
00:30:54,058 --> 00:30:57,203
There are things
I wish would go away.

337
00:30:58,409 --> 00:31:03,362
But won't. You know.
Things we don't talk about.

338
00:31:08,489 --> 00:31:11,010
You never left me.

339
00:31:11,082 --> 00:31:12,447
You still made love to me,

340
00:31:12,457 --> 00:31:15,602
despite disturbing demands elsewhere.

341
00:31:19,018 --> 00:31:24,069
But all those sandals, Grant.
All those bare female toes.

342
00:31:26,346 --> 00:31:30,016
What could you do but be a part of the time
you were a part of?

343
00:31:30,026 --> 00:31:32,328
All those pretty girls.

344
00:31:32,394 --> 00:31:36,644
Didn't seem like anyone
was willing to be left out.

345
00:31:37,033 --> 00:31:38,463
I think you did all right,

346
00:31:38,473 --> 00:31:42,816
compared to some
of your colleagues.

347
00:31:42,889 --> 00:31:45,224
Those who left their wives.

348
00:31:47,401 --> 00:31:50,886
And the women who
wouldn't put up with it.

349
00:31:53,193 --> 00:31:57,896
I think people are too demanding.

350
00:31:57,962 --> 00:32:01,247
People want to be in love
every single day.

351
00:32:01,257 --> 00:32:05,698
What a liability. And then that silly girl.

352
00:32:05,770 --> 00:32:07,895
That silly girl Veronica.

353
00:32:08,713 --> 00:32:11,359
Girls that age
are always going around

354
00:32:11,369 --> 00:32:14,684
saying they're going
to kill themselves.

355
00:32:14,697 --> 00:32:16,697
But that was that.

356
00:32:18,249 --> 00:32:19,712
Promised me a new life.

357
00:32:19,722 --> 00:32:21,826
We moved out here,

358
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:25,159
that is exactly what you gave me.

359
00:32:27,434 --> 00:32:29,247
How long ago was that?

360
00:32:29,257 --> 00:32:32,160
20 years.

361
00:32:36,170 --> 00:32:38,170
God, that's shocking.

362
00:32:39,946 --> 00:32:44,223
So you see, I'm going...

363
00:32:44,298 --> 00:32:46,785
but I'm not gone.

364
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:16,614
- Fiona.
- Grant.

365
00:33:19,626 --> 00:33:21,626
Don't go.

366
00:33:22,985 --> 00:33:24,992
That's what is happening, Grant.

367
00:33:25,002 --> 00:33:27,968
It's happening... right now.

368
00:33:56,969 --> 00:33:58,969
Fiona.

369
00:34:00,009 --> 00:34:01,888
Hello. I'm checking in today.

370
00:34:01,898 --> 00:34:03,679
My name is Fiona Andersson.

371
00:34:03,689 --> 00:34:04,895
Yes, Mrs. Andersson.

372
00:34:04,905 --> 00:34:06,752
We have your room
all ready for you.

373
00:34:06,762 --> 00:34:08,320
- Perfect.
- We'll have our supervisor,

374
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:09,472
Mrs. Montpelier, show you.

375
00:34:09,482 --> 00:34:11,840
I'll go fetch her. She's expecting you.

376
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:13,850
Thank you.

377
00:34:14,058 --> 00:34:16,058
Fiona.

378
00:34:16,138 --> 00:34:17,600
Grant.

379
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,232
I can't go away from you like this.

380
00:34:19,242 --> 00:34:23,945
We had nothing
to tie us down, Grant.

381
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:26,752
You could have just driven away
and forsaken me.

382
00:34:26,762 --> 00:34:29,064
But you didn't.

383
00:34:30,602 --> 00:34:32,602
I thank you for that.

384
00:34:37,066 --> 00:34:38,976
- Mrs. Andersson.
- Oh, hello.

385
00:34:38,986 --> 00:34:41,024
- How do you do? I'm Madeleine.
- Hello.

386
00:34:41,034 --> 00:34:42,625
Should I give you two a moment?

387
00:34:42,635 --> 00:34:44,544
- No, thank you.
- Yes, please.

388
00:34:44,554 --> 00:34:46,336
All right, then, well,
we'll get you settled in your room,

389
00:34:46,346 --> 00:34:48,320
and then I'd like to give you
a tour of the facility.

390
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:52,325
- That'd be lovely. Thank you.
- Right this way.

391
00:34:56,905 --> 00:35:01,070
So, as you can see,
we get a lot of natural light.

392
00:35:01,674 --> 00:35:03,976
Here we go.

393
00:35:11,114 --> 00:35:14,278
Yes. This'll do just fine.

394
00:35:14,346 --> 00:35:16,704
Good. I'm so glad
you like it. Now, is...

395
00:35:16,714 --> 00:35:18,368
is this all you brought
with you today?

396
00:35:18,378 --> 00:35:21,268
- For now.
- We'll see how it goes.

397
00:35:22,122 --> 00:35:25,951
Well, if you need any help arranging things,
you just let me know.

398
00:35:25,961 --> 00:35:29,093
Thank you, Mrs. Montpelier.

399
00:35:29,163 --> 00:35:32,544
Now, if you wouldn't mind, I'd like to say
good-bye to my husband.

400
00:35:32,554 --> 00:35:36,928
We haven't been apart for a month
for the last 44 years.

401
00:35:36,938 --> 00:35:38,176
It could be quite something.

402
00:35:38,186 --> 00:35:40,186
Okay.

403
00:35:46,506 --> 00:35:48,506
Please, Fiona.

404
00:35:51,626 --> 00:35:53,665
Grant.

405
00:35:53,738 --> 00:35:56,258
Fiona...

406
00:35:56,330 --> 00:35:58,370
You know what I'd like?

407
00:36:01,898 --> 00:36:03,584
I'd like to make love,

408
00:36:03,594 --> 00:36:06,693
and then I'd like you to go.

409
00:36:06,763 --> 00:36:08,128
Because I need to stay here,

410
00:36:08,138 --> 00:36:09,984
and if you make it hard for me,

411
00:36:09,994 --> 00:36:12,969
I might cry so hard
I'll never stop.

412
00:36:44,266 --> 00:36:46,266
Go now.

413
00:36:48,299 --> 00:36:50,299
Go now.

414
00:37:33,578 --> 00:37:34,721
"All of the officers

415
00:37:34,731 --> 00:37:36,160
"were from outside
the local area,

416
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:38,144
"and it probably had not
entered their minds

417
00:37:38,154 --> 00:37:40,768
"that almost all of us
were named McDonald.

418
00:37:40,778 --> 00:37:43,040
"Nobody moved except for
the shuffling of feet.

419
00:37:43,050 --> 00:37:45,319
The red roo"...Hey.

420
00:37:45,386 --> 00:37:47,616
- Hello, there.
- Kristy. We met on your tour.

421
00:37:47,626 --> 00:37:49,153
How's Mrs. Andersson?
Has she settled in?

422
00:37:49,163 --> 00:37:51,265
I'm wondering if I could have

423
00:37:51,275 --> 00:37:53,313
a moment of your time
to ask your advice?

424
00:37:53,323 --> 00:37:55,552
Oh, sure. I was just
reading to Mr. Burke here.

425
00:37:55,562 --> 00:37:56,832
Maybe when we finish this chapter,

426
00:37:56,842 --> 00:37:58,752
I can come find you
in the dining room?

427
00:37:58,762 --> 00:38:00,802
Sure. That's fine.

428
00:38:02,730 --> 00:38:05,824
"The red roof lights
revolved in the afternoon sun,

429
00:38:05,834 --> 00:38:09,319
and even the dogs were
temporarily quiet."

430
00:38:21,994 --> 00:38:25,857
Hi, there, Mr. Andersson.
Now, how can I help you?

431
00:38:25,867 --> 00:38:27,777
Going down the center
of the dining room...

432
00:38:27,787 --> 00:38:30,753
That's Frank. He used to be the play-by-play
guy for the Winnipeg Jets.

433
00:38:30,763 --> 00:38:32,763
- Really?
- Yeah.

434
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:35,649
He loved his job too much to retire.

435
00:38:35,659 --> 00:38:38,039
Frank's on the second floor.

436
00:38:41,355 --> 00:38:48,839
I just... My wife has always been
sort of a different sort of person.

437
00:38:48,907 --> 00:38:53,504
I've been told that Alzheimer's can't be
confirmed until after...

438
00:38:53,514 --> 00:38:55,751
And on our way here today,

439
00:38:55,819 --> 00:38:57,537
we passed this conservation area

440
00:38:57,547 --> 00:39:00,613
where we went
for a walk last spring.

441
00:39:00,683 --> 00:39:02,881
And there were these gorgeous flowers.
The skunk lilies.

442
00:39:02,891 --> 00:39:04,737
Oh, those are
beautiful, aren't they?

443
00:39:04,747 --> 00:39:07,520
Yes, they really made
an impression, see?

444
00:39:07,530 --> 00:39:09,824
And even though the whole
place was covered in snow,

445
00:39:09,834 --> 00:39:12,387
she said, "Oh, remember?"

446
00:39:13,931 --> 00:39:16,960
Now, that was...
that was... quite recently.

447
00:39:16,970 --> 00:39:20,257
And isn't the short-term memory
the thing that goes first?

448
00:39:20,267 --> 00:39:24,576
Well, yeah, but not all at once.

449
00:39:24,651 --> 00:39:26,081
And what's comforting

450
00:39:26,091 --> 00:39:31,276
is the long-term memory sometimes
stays for quite a long time.

451
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:34,176
Yeah, her long-term memory
seems quite intact.

452
00:39:34,186 --> 00:39:37,665
But when she mentioned that,
about the skunk lilies,

453
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:40,417
it was all I could do not
to turn the truck around.

454
00:39:40,427 --> 00:39:46,722
What if this is just her
just being herself?

455
00:39:46,795 --> 00:39:48,966
She's far too young to...

456
00:39:50,506 --> 00:39:52,288
She is young.

457
00:39:52,298 --> 00:39:55,016
And it is hard.

458
00:39:55,083 --> 00:39:57,504
No doubt about that.

459
00:39:57,578 --> 00:39:59,958
A month is a real long time.

460
00:40:02,187 --> 00:40:05,377
I mean, between you and me,
I don't know about the policy myself.

461
00:40:05,387 --> 00:40:08,384
I think it makes it easier for the staff
is what I think.

462
00:40:08,394 --> 00:40:12,355
Look. I'll give you my pager number.

463
00:40:13,803 --> 00:40:15,329
You can call me
whenever you want.

464
00:40:15,339 --> 00:40:19,164
You can call me every day
if you feel like it.

465
00:40:21,163 --> 00:40:23,367
I don't know what to do.

466
00:40:25,099 --> 00:40:27,905
Mr. Andersson,
your wife wrote you this note,

467
00:40:27,915 --> 00:40:30,805
and she asked me to pass it along.

468
00:40:39,723 --> 00:40:41,723
Okay.

469
00:40:46,731 --> 00:40:48,870
Thank you so much.

470
00:41:12,459 --> 00:41:15,585
"Throughout much of the thinking brain,

471
00:41:15,595 --> 00:41:21,035
gooey plaques now crowd neurons
from outside the cell membranes."

472
00:41:22,443 --> 00:41:24,777
"And knotty tangles

473
00:41:24,843 --> 00:41:29,664
mangle microtubal transports
from inside the cells."

474
00:41:38,059 --> 00:41:42,649
"All told, tens of millions
of synapses dissolve away."

475
00:41:44,236 --> 00:41:47,041
"Because the structures
and substructures of the brain

476
00:41:47,051 --> 00:41:49,122
"are so highly specialized,

477
00:41:49,132 --> 00:41:53,060
"the precise location
of the neuronal loss

478
00:41:53,131 --> 00:41:58,597
determines what specific abilities
will become impaired."

479
00:42:03,019 --> 00:42:07,460
"It is like a series
of circuit breakers

480
00:42:07,531 --> 00:42:12,233
in a large house,
flipping off one by one."

481
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:10,433
That's a great-looking coffee maker.

482
00:43:10,443 --> 00:43:13,418
I always meant to get one of those.

483
00:43:14,379 --> 00:43:17,698
I saw they had them on sale
at Canadian Tire.

484
00:43:17,708 --> 00:43:20,897
They gave it to us, my son and his wife.

485
00:43:20,907 --> 00:43:23,009
They live in Kamloops, B.C.

486
00:43:23,019 --> 00:43:26,337
They send us more stuff
than we can handle.

487
00:43:26,347 --> 00:43:31,447
Wouldn't hurt if they spent the money
to come see us instead.

488
00:43:31,979 --> 00:43:34,369
I suppose they're busy
with their own lives.

489
00:43:34,379 --> 00:43:36,770
Not so busy they couldn't
go to Hawaii last year.

490
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:38,146
I mean, you could understand it

491
00:43:38,156 --> 00:43:40,994
if there was someone
in the family closer at hand,

492
00:43:41,004 --> 00:43:44,452
but, uh... he's the only one.

493
00:43:48,267 --> 00:43:51,683
People do get lonely,

494
00:43:51,755 --> 00:43:57,365
especially when they're deprived
of seeing someone they care about.

495
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:01,445
Fiona, for instance.

496
00:44:04,171 --> 00:44:05,954
My wife.

497
00:44:05,964 --> 00:44:09,619
I thought you said
you went and visited her.

498
00:44:10,923 --> 00:44:13,062
I do.

499
00:44:13,132 --> 00:44:15,652
No, that's not it.

500
00:44:15,723 --> 00:44:17,858
She's really settling in well.

501
00:44:17,868 --> 00:44:19,266
Good. Good.

502
00:44:19,276 --> 00:44:21,121
Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow,
Mr. Andersson.

503
00:44:21,131 --> 00:44:23,426
Right. So I'll see you
tomorrow morning, then.

504
00:44:23,436 --> 00:44:28,111
Now, remember,
she may be a little surprised to see you.

505
00:44:28,203 --> 00:44:29,954
Don't be shaken by that.

506
00:44:29,964 --> 00:44:32,194
Just... She hasn't seen you in a while.

507
00:44:32,204 --> 00:44:34,754
She's sort of settled in here.

508
00:44:36,235 --> 00:44:38,235
I understand.

509
00:44:49,931 --> 00:44:53,761
There you are. I'll walk you down to her.

510
00:44:53,835 --> 00:44:56,137
Wow. Narcissus this early.

511
00:44:56,203 --> 00:44:58,305
You must have spent a fortune.

512
00:44:58,315 --> 00:45:00,898
We brought it back here.
Hi, Mr. Andersson.

513
00:45:00,908 --> 00:45:02,908
It's great to see you.

514
00:45:02,924 --> 00:45:05,537
I'm gonna help you find
your sweater, Mrs. Albright.

515
00:45:05,547 --> 00:45:09,089
All right. Here we are.
There is her room, right over there.

516
00:45:09,099 --> 00:45:11,426
You remember from last time
you were here, don't you?

517
00:45:11,436 --> 00:45:16,111
Her nameplate's right on the door.
I'll leave you to it.

518
00:45:53,996 --> 00:45:57,186
There she is. Now you just
go over and say hello,

519
00:45:57,196 --> 00:46:00,961
and try not to startle her...
Remember, she may not...

520
00:46:00,971 --> 00:46:02,971
Well, just go ahead.

521
00:46:21,228 --> 00:46:24,457
Bridge. Deadly serious.

522
00:46:24,524 --> 00:46:27,752
Quite rabid about it.

523
00:46:27,819 --> 00:46:31,074
I can remember being like that
at college for a while.

524
00:46:31,084 --> 00:46:35,874
My friends and I would cut class
and sit in the common room and smoke

525
00:46:35,884 --> 00:46:38,087
and play like cutthroats.

526
00:46:38,156 --> 00:46:39,778
One's name was Phoebe.

527
00:46:39,788 --> 00:46:41,315
I don't remember the others.

528
00:46:41,325 --> 00:46:42,882
Phoebe Hart.

529
00:46:42,892 --> 00:46:45,543
Oh, you knew her, too.

530
00:46:45,612 --> 00:46:48,387
Can I get you something?
A cup of tea?

531
00:46:48,397 --> 00:46:51,075
I'm afraid the coffee's
not up to much here.

532
00:46:51,085 --> 00:46:52,322
I don't drink tea.

533
00:46:52,332 --> 00:46:54,210
Oh.

534
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:55,906
I brought you some flowers.

535
00:46:55,916 --> 00:46:58,786
I thought they might do
to brighten up your room.

536
00:46:58,796 --> 00:47:01,122
I went to your room,
but you weren't there.

537
00:47:01,132 --> 00:47:03,466
Well, no, I'm here.

538
00:47:06,188 --> 00:47:08,568
So you've made a new friend.

539
00:47:08,684 --> 00:47:11,302
Oh, that's just Aubrey.

540
00:47:11,372 --> 00:47:16,325
The funny thing is I knew
him years and years ago.

541
00:47:16,396 --> 00:47:18,018
He used to work in the store,

542
00:47:18,028 --> 00:47:21,634
the hardware store where
my grandpa used to shop.

543
00:47:21,644 --> 00:47:24,418
He and I were always kidding around,

544
00:47:24,428 --> 00:47:27,810
but he never could get up
the nerve to ask me out.

545
00:47:27,820 --> 00:47:30,914
Until the very last weekend,
he took me to a ball game.

546
00:47:30,924 --> 00:47:35,746
But my grandpa showed up
to drive us home.

547
00:47:35,820 --> 00:47:39,017
I was up visiting for the summer.

548
00:47:39,085 --> 00:47:42,020
Visiting my grandparents.

549
00:47:42,092 --> 00:47:44,982
They lived in a cottage on a lake.

550
00:47:45,868 --> 00:47:48,674
Fiona, I know where
your grandparents lived.

551
00:47:48,684 --> 00:47:51,149
It's where we lived. We live.

552
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:53,788
Really?

553
00:47:54,764 --> 00:47:56,322
I'd better go back.

554
00:47:56,332 --> 00:47:58,881
He thinks he can't play
without me sitting there.

555
00:47:58,891 --> 00:48:01,762
It's silly. I hardly
know the game anymore.

556
00:48:01,772 --> 00:48:03,810
I'm afraid you'll have
to excuse me.

557
00:48:03,820 --> 00:48:04,962
Will you be through soon?

558
00:48:04,972 --> 00:48:06,946
We should be. I mean, it depends.

559
00:48:06,956 --> 00:48:09,634
If you asked that grim-looking
lady over there nicely,

560
00:48:09,644 --> 00:48:12,024
she'll get you a cup of tea.

561
00:48:13,389 --> 00:48:15,010
- No, I'm fine.
- I can leave you, then?

562
00:48:15,020 --> 00:48:18,306
You can entertain yourself?
Must all seem strange to you.

563
00:48:18,316 --> 00:48:20,930
But you'll be surprised
how soon you get used to it.

564
00:48:20,940 --> 00:48:23,489
You'll get to know who everybody is,

565
00:48:23,499 --> 00:48:27,586
except that some of them
are pretty well off in the clouds, you know?

566
00:48:27,596 --> 00:48:32,550
Can't expect them all
to get to know who you are.

567
00:49:48,364 --> 00:49:51,331
Hey, I've been thinking of dying my hair.
What do you think?

568
00:49:51,341 --> 00:49:54,741
Do you think I'd look
good with red hair?

569
00:50:13,292 --> 00:50:16,130
You caught her at sort of a bad moment,
involved in a game.

570
00:50:16,140 --> 00:50:18,344
She isn't even playing.

571
00:50:18,412 --> 00:50:20,642
Well, but her friend's playing, Aubrey.

572
00:50:20,652 --> 00:50:21,699
Now, who is Aubrey?

573
00:50:21,709 --> 00:50:23,811
That's who he is, Aubrey.

574
00:50:23,821 --> 00:50:25,314
You know, they get
these attachments.

575
00:50:25,324 --> 00:50:27,171
That kind of takes over for a while.

576
00:50:27,181 --> 00:50:29,122
Best buddy kind of thing.

577
00:50:29,132 --> 00:50:31,132
Sort of a phase.

578
00:50:31,469 --> 00:50:33,849
Does she even know who I am?

579
00:50:34,861 --> 00:50:36,771
No, she might not.

580
00:50:36,781 --> 00:50:40,162
Not today, and then,
tomorrow you never know.

581
00:50:40,172 --> 00:50:43,107
Things change back and forth all the time.

582
00:50:43,117 --> 00:50:45,986
You'll see the way it is
once you get used to coming here.

583
00:50:45,996 --> 00:50:47,715
You'll learn not to take it so personal.

584
00:50:47,725 --> 00:50:50,507
Learn to take it day by day.

585
00:51:12,653 --> 00:51:14,403
Oh, I'm sorry.

586
00:51:14,413 --> 00:51:17,218
I'll have to go and fix that now.

587
00:51:45,293 --> 00:51:47,714
Here's Yung Menenikenaha,

588
00:51:47,788 --> 00:51:51,362
desperately clinging
to his one-stroke lead.

589
00:51:51,372 --> 00:51:52,963
Here's the swing.

590
00:51:52,973 --> 00:51:54,690
It doesn't look good.

591
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:57,283
Looks like he's pushed it
out to the right.

592
00:51:57,293 --> 00:51:59,171
It lands 25 feet from the green.

593
00:51:59,181 --> 00:52:00,835
This must be disappointing.

594
00:52:00,845 --> 00:52:03,330
It doesn't look good
for Yung Menenikenaha.

595
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:05,315
He was three strokes
on the happy side of par

596
00:52:05,325 --> 00:52:07,790
until these last three holes.

597
00:52:11,149 --> 00:52:14,858
Look at you, Mr. Andersson.

598
00:52:14,924 --> 00:52:19,514
I think you might be
one of our most frequent visitors.

599
00:52:26,061 --> 00:52:27,459
Hi, Fiona.

600
00:52:27,469 --> 00:52:29,507
Oh, you are persistent, aren't you?

601
00:52:29,517 --> 00:52:31,395
I brought you some books.

602
00:52:31,405 --> 00:52:33,859
They don't seem to have
an awful lot around here.

603
00:52:33,869 --> 00:52:36,099
<i>Letters from Iceland by Auden.</i>

604
00:52:36,109 --> 00:52:39,331
We always meant to read that together,
didn't we?

605
00:52:39,341 --> 00:52:41,635
Do you think it'd be possible to talk alone?

606
00:52:41,645 --> 00:52:42,947
Well, I don't know.

607
00:52:42,957 --> 00:52:45,635
Um, Aubrey's card game
starts in a few minutes,

608
00:52:45,645 --> 00:52:47,459
and then we usually go walking,

609
00:52:47,469 --> 00:52:48,962
and then he does his drawing...

610
00:52:48,972 --> 00:52:52,195
Or perhaps you can find
a bit of time later on.

611
00:52:52,205 --> 00:52:53,603
Um, I'll stay here.

612
00:52:53,613 --> 00:52:55,459
Or I'll come back in a few hours.

613
00:52:55,469 --> 00:52:58,359
Oh, you are persistent,
aren't you?

614
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:21,220
Up comes Kapanen... Boy, oh, boy!

615
00:53:21,230 --> 00:53:23,203
Here we are at the Spectrum in Philadelphia.

616
00:53:23,213 --> 00:53:25,315
It's sudden-death overtime.
They're tied 2-2.

617
00:53:25,325 --> 00:53:27,139
Here are the Leafs again,
led by Andreychuk.

618
00:53:27,149 --> 00:53:28,452
He carries it over the blue line,

619
00:53:28,462 --> 00:53:30,051
winds up a shot right on!

620
00:53:30,061 --> 00:53:32,163
The bounce, the rebound
comes back behind the net.

621
00:53:32,173 --> 00:53:33,412
McCabe couldn't get to it.

622
00:53:33,422 --> 00:53:34,660
It goes back on the left wing

623
00:53:34,670 --> 00:53:37,284
and here come the Flyers
led by Roenick again.

624
00:53:37,294 --> 00:53:39,459
Roenick and Mitchell, what a twosome
this two has been.

625
00:53:39,469 --> 00:53:41,059
A shot right on!
Oh, it just went wide.

626
00:53:41,069 --> 00:53:42,819
- Go for it, Frank.
- Over to the right side.

627
00:53:42,829 --> 00:53:44,035
Here we go again. The Leafs again.

628
00:53:44,045 --> 00:53:46,467
Here's Sundin carrying it
up over the line.

629
00:53:46,477 --> 00:53:49,123
Can't get a shot away
and it's cleared away by Philadelphia.

630
00:53:49,133 --> 00:53:51,523
A loose puck grabbed by Philadelphia
over on the left wing...

631
00:53:51,533 --> 00:53:54,242
I just came down to say
Aubrey is having his nap

632
00:53:54,252 --> 00:53:56,035
if you'd like to, um, talk.

633
00:53:56,045 --> 00:53:57,860
Oh, sure.

634
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:00,003
Can we go somewhere
a little more private?

635
00:54:00,013 --> 00:54:01,571
...the side with Mitchell.
He shoots, he scores!

636
00:54:01,581 --> 00:54:03,075
If... If you'd like.

637
00:54:03,085 --> 00:54:05,827
And Philly wins this series
by a score of 3-2.

638
00:54:05,837 --> 00:54:07,364
That's it this season for the Leafs.

639
00:54:07,374 --> 00:54:09,731
Look at Phil Hitchcock.
Is he a happy coach.

640
00:54:09,741 --> 00:54:11,331
Philadelphia wins 3-2.

641
00:54:11,341 --> 00:54:14,826
The game is over
in sudden-death overtime.

642
00:54:33,613 --> 00:54:35,844
Y-You said you had
some books for me?

643
00:54:35,854 --> 00:54:37,854
This.

644
00:54:39,181 --> 00:54:40,675
<i>Letters from Iceland.</i>

645
00:54:40,685 --> 00:54:42,980
Yes, yes.
You said by Auden.

646
00:54:43,469 --> 00:54:46,764
Yes. That's right.

647
00:54:46,829 --> 00:54:49,961
Now... where is Iceland?

648
00:54:53,102 --> 00:54:57,357
Well, Iceland is
in the middle of the Atlantic.

649
00:54:57,421 --> 00:54:59,658
It's an island.

650
00:55:01,326 --> 00:55:03,395
Youngest country in the world.

651
00:55:03,405 --> 00:55:05,530
It's constantly erupting.

652
00:55:05,549 --> 00:55:09,062
Volcanoes, earthquakes.

653
00:55:09,133 --> 00:55:12,679
It's always shaking itself off.

654
00:55:14,062 --> 00:55:17,155
Wouldn't it be nice to come
from a young country?

655
00:55:17,165 --> 00:55:19,459
You do. That's where you're from.

656
00:55:19,469 --> 00:55:22,698
That's where
your people are from.

657
00:55:22,766 --> 00:55:27,239
They immigrated here in the late 1800s.

658
00:55:27,310 --> 00:55:29,668
But that's where you're from, Fiona.

659
00:55:29,678 --> 00:55:34,948
And I teach... Well, I taught
the myths from there.

660
00:55:35,022 --> 00:55:36,164
Norse mythology.

661
00:55:36,174 --> 00:55:37,604
l-I must have been there, then.

662
00:55:37,614 --> 00:55:39,614
Have I been there?

663
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:42,270
No.

664
00:55:42,894 --> 00:55:44,356
Oh.

665
00:55:44,366 --> 00:55:46,576
Why not? Wasn't I curious?

666
00:55:47,309 --> 00:55:49,993
You were very curious.

667
00:55:50,062 --> 00:55:52,068
Very curious.

668
00:55:52,141 --> 00:55:56,232
You always said
there ought to be one place

669
00:55:56,302 --> 00:55:59,043
that you knew about
and you thought about

670
00:55:59,053 --> 00:56:00,803
and maybe even longed for,

671
00:56:00,813 --> 00:56:03,618
but you did never did get to see.

672
00:56:08,974 --> 00:56:11,657
Did I say that?

673
00:56:11,726 --> 00:56:13,726
Yes, you said that.

674
00:56:27,501 --> 00:56:29,731
Well, I'd better go and see to Aubrey.

675
00:56:29,741 --> 00:56:32,387
He'll be wanting a little
walk around, I suppose.

676
00:56:32,397 --> 00:56:33,443
It was nice chatting.

677
00:56:33,453 --> 00:56:35,939
You'll be back again
tomorrow, I suppose?

678
00:56:35,949 --> 00:56:39,495
Fiona, what are you doing...

679
00:56:39,566 --> 00:56:42,201
What are you doing with Aubrey?

680
00:56:44,206 --> 00:56:47,621
He doesn't confuse me.

681
00:56:47,694 --> 00:56:50,159
He doesn't confuse me at all.

682
00:56:54,349 --> 00:56:57,317
Well, it's been nice chatting.

683
00:56:57,390 --> 00:57:00,620
I'll see you again
tomorrow, I suppose.

684
00:57:19,245 --> 00:57:24,260
These affections between residents,
do they ever go too far?

685
00:57:24,270 --> 00:57:25,860
Well, that depends
on what you mean.

686
00:57:25,870 --> 00:57:28,484
The problem we have here, it's funny.

687
00:57:28,494 --> 00:57:30,339
It's actually often the ones

688
00:57:30,349 --> 00:57:32,452
who haven't been friendly
with each other at all.

689
00:57:32,462 --> 00:57:34,051
I mean, they maybe
don't even know each other

690
00:57:34,061 --> 00:57:36,452
beyond knowing, like,
is it a man or is it a woman?

691
00:57:36,462 --> 00:57:37,860
And you'd think it'd be the old guys

692
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:39,620
trying to crawl in bed
with the old ladies,

693
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:41,251
but half the time
it's the other way around.

694
00:57:41,261 --> 00:57:44,036
It's the old ladies
going after the old men.

695
00:57:44,046 --> 00:57:47,106
It could be they aren't so worn out.

696
00:57:53,038 --> 00:57:57,413
Now don't get me wrong.
I don't mean Fiona.

697
00:57:57,486 --> 00:57:59,486
Fiona is a lady.

698
00:57:59,501 --> 00:58:01,869
She's a real lady.

699
00:58:03,470 --> 00:58:06,503
I sometimes wonder...

700
00:58:06,573 --> 00:58:08,573
You wonder what?

701
00:58:10,926 --> 00:58:16,075
I wonder if she isn't putting on
some kind of... charade.

702
00:58:16,141 --> 00:58:18,020
A what?

703
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:20,550
Some kind of act.

704
00:58:20,621 --> 00:58:24,036
Maybe some kind of punishment.

705
00:58:27,406 --> 00:58:29,406
Why would she do that?

706
00:58:35,598 --> 00:58:37,598
Oh.

707
00:59:05,262 --> 00:59:07,172
Are you getting tired?

708
00:59:07,182 --> 00:59:09,307
- No.
- Are you certain...

709
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:17,606
Excuse me.

710
00:59:17,678 --> 00:59:19,678
Yes, Mr. Andersson?

711
00:59:19,727 --> 00:59:22,148
How can I help you?

712
00:59:22,221 --> 00:59:23,940
Fiona's wearing someone else's sweater.

713
00:59:23,950 --> 00:59:26,276
Well, it's pretty, isn't it?

714
00:59:26,286 --> 00:59:27,749
No, it's not pretty. It's tacky.

715
00:59:27,759 --> 00:59:30,468
- She would never wear it.
- Well, I'll tell you what.

716
00:59:30,478 --> 00:59:33,860
You can talk to the duty attendant
on Mrs. Andersson's wing.

717
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:35,876
Boy, it's a marvel, really,

718
00:59:35,886 --> 00:59:40,136
the way she's getting him up
and out of that chair.

719
00:59:44,718 --> 00:59:46,718
Can you manage?

720
00:59:48,653 --> 00:59:50,244
Will you be all right?

721
00:59:50,254 --> 00:59:52,379
I'll be back in a second.

722
00:59:54,702 --> 00:59:56,971
Fiona, I'm your husband.

723
00:59:57,038 --> 00:59:58,916
Fiona, it's Grant.

724
00:59:58,926 --> 01:00:01,092
We've been married for 45 years.

725
01:00:01,102 --> 01:00:04,356
Look at me, Fiona.
That is not your sweater.

726
01:00:04,366 --> 01:00:06,309
We had a good life together.

727
01:00:06,319 --> 01:00:09,091
Those are your words,
Fiona, not mine.

728
01:00:09,101 --> 01:00:11,226
That is not your sweater.

729
01:00:16,622 --> 01:00:18,924
It's all right.

730
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:21,673
It's all right. It's all right.

731
01:00:21,742 --> 01:00:23,396
I'm coming straight back.

732
01:00:23,406 --> 01:00:24,836
I'm coming straight back.

733
01:00:24,846 --> 01:00:27,141
It's going to be all right.

734
01:00:44,750 --> 01:00:48,065
I'll see you again tomorrow, I suppose.

735
01:00:51,534 --> 01:00:53,534
Please...

736
01:00:54,702 --> 01:00:56,702
don't.

737
01:00:58,414 --> 01:01:01,131
Please, please don't.

738
01:01:04,430 --> 01:01:07,405
You're very persistent, aren't you?

739
01:01:13,006 --> 01:01:16,105
I wish l...

740
01:01:16,174 --> 01:01:18,174
Wish I knew what...

741
01:01:26,670 --> 01:01:29,985
We'll see you again
tomorrow, I suppose.

742
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:13,241
You're not doing
too well, are you?

743
01:02:13,294 --> 01:02:15,294
Well, no big surprise.

744
01:02:15,311 --> 01:02:18,310
What we're handling isn't so easy.

745
01:02:20,526 --> 01:02:21,796
I thought when I married,

746
01:02:21,806 --> 01:02:25,157
I'd be with someone to the final stretch.

747
01:02:25,167 --> 01:02:28,396
I'm betting you thought the same.

748
01:02:28,462 --> 01:02:30,462
Well, didn't work out.

749
01:02:34,191 --> 01:02:38,534
So, I, uh, think
you're here for a reason.

750
01:02:38,607 --> 01:02:43,962
I'm the kind of person you can
say things flat out to, so shoot.

751
01:02:45,871 --> 01:02:48,869
I wonder if you would consider
taking Aubrey back to Meadowlake,

752
01:02:48,879 --> 01:02:51,628
maybe just for a visit.

753
01:02:51,694 --> 01:02:55,141
Or I suppose I could take Aubrey
out there myself.

754
01:02:55,151 --> 01:02:57,531
I wouldn't mind that at all.

755
01:03:01,743 --> 01:03:03,743
Homemade.

756
01:03:10,127 --> 01:03:12,127
Really?

757
01:03:13,999 --> 01:03:17,315
No. No, I can't do that.

758
01:03:17,391 --> 01:03:19,717
And the reason is
I don't want to upset him.

759
01:03:19,727 --> 01:03:21,348
But wouldn't he understand
it was just a visit?

760
01:03:21,358 --> 01:03:24,076
He understands everything.

761
01:03:24,143 --> 01:03:26,309
Now, if I go to all that trouble,

762
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:28,965
I'd prefer to take him someplace
that'd be more fun?

763
01:03:28,975 --> 01:03:31,493
It would make more sense
to take him to the mall

764
01:03:31,503 --> 01:03:32,868
where there are kids and whatnot.

765
01:03:32,878 --> 01:03:35,269
And then I'd have to get him all ready,

766
01:03:35,279 --> 01:03:36,773
maneuver him into the car.

767
01:03:36,783 --> 01:03:39,013
He's a big man. He's not that easy to manage.

768
01:03:39,023 --> 01:03:40,869
Even if I agreed to do it?

769
01:03:40,879 --> 01:03:42,340
You couldn't do it.
You don't know him.

770
01:03:42,350 --> 01:03:43,684
You couldn't manage him.

771
01:03:43,694 --> 01:03:45,669
And he wouldn't stand
your doing for him.

772
01:03:45,679 --> 01:03:50,185
And after all that, what would he get out of it?

773
01:04:12,719 --> 01:04:14,213
Smoke?

774
01:04:14,223 --> 01:04:16,223
No. No, thanks.

775
01:04:16,271 --> 01:04:18,213
What, did you never,
or did you quit?

776
01:04:18,223 --> 01:04:19,749
I quit.

777
01:04:19,759 --> 01:04:20,901
How long ago?

778
01:04:20,911 --> 01:04:25,418
Oh, 30 years, maybe more.

779
01:04:25,487 --> 01:04:27,487
I quit quitting.

780
01:04:29,230 --> 01:04:33,477
Just made a resolution to quit quitting,
that's all.

781
01:04:33,487 --> 01:04:36,586
So your wife's depressed, huh?

782
01:04:37,710 --> 01:04:39,685
What's her name again? I forget.

783
01:04:39,695 --> 01:04:41,253
Fiona.

784
01:04:41,263 --> 01:04:43,269
And how old were you when you met?

785
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:45,516
She was 18.

786
01:04:45,583 --> 01:04:49,323
Holy, that's pretty young
to get married, eh?

787
01:04:52,175 --> 01:04:53,509
Wasn't my idea.

788
01:04:53,519 --> 01:04:55,685
You mean she proposed to you?

789
01:04:55,695 --> 01:04:57,285
Well, that's lovely,
that's what I think.

790
01:04:57,295 --> 01:04:58,277
How'd she do it?

791
01:04:58,287 --> 01:05:00,805
She hadn't planned it necessarily.

792
01:05:00,815 --> 01:05:04,262
We were in Tobermory
waiting for the ferry to Manitoulin,

793
01:05:04,272 --> 01:05:07,173
and it was miserable and rainy,

794
01:05:07,247 --> 01:05:10,760
and she was in a good mood.

795
01:05:10,831 --> 01:05:12,612
She didn't want any part
of my sour mood.

796
01:05:12,622 --> 01:05:15,205
And what'd she do, what'd she say?

797
01:05:15,215 --> 01:05:19,820
Well, she said,
"Do you think it'd be fun...

798
01:05:19,888 --> 01:05:23,333
Do you think it'd be fun
if we got married?"

799
01:05:23,343 --> 01:05:24,869
And what did you say?

800
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,277
I took her up on it.

801
01:05:26,287 --> 01:05:28,360
I shouted yes.

802
01:05:32,847 --> 01:05:35,737
I never wanted
to be away from her.

803
01:05:37,519 --> 01:05:39,729
She had the spark of life.

804
01:05:41,871 --> 01:05:43,813
You know, nothing can take away

805
01:05:43,823 --> 01:05:47,845
what's happened to you
and what you've experienced.

806
01:05:47,855 --> 01:05:49,605
I don't think so, anyway.

807
01:05:49,615 --> 01:05:54,700
Even if it goes away somehow,
it's still there.

808
01:05:54,767 --> 01:05:56,807
It's still what you are.

809
01:05:58,543 --> 01:05:59,941
It's curious.

810
01:05:59,951 --> 01:06:01,221
What's curious?

811
01:06:01,231 --> 01:06:04,460
All of that "madly in love" business.

812
01:06:04,528 --> 01:06:06,149
The beginning.

813
01:06:06,159 --> 01:06:11,310
I hear myself tell the story,
and it all sounds so crucial.

814
01:06:13,199 --> 01:06:15,109
I suppose it is.

815
01:06:15,119 --> 01:06:17,349
But compared to what we ended up with,

816
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:19,530
until recently...

817
01:06:21,423 --> 01:06:25,133
all of that seems
so superficial somehow.

818
01:07:04,976 --> 01:07:08,718
Not such a fun place to visit, eh?

819
01:07:08,783 --> 01:07:09,733
Excuse me?

820
01:07:09,743 --> 01:07:13,223
Not such a fun place to visit.

821
01:07:13,295 --> 01:07:15,295
Fucking depressing.

822
01:07:16,655 --> 01:07:17,637
No offense.

823
01:07:17,647 --> 01:07:19,647
None taken.

824
01:07:20,879 --> 01:07:24,010
No one came to visit you, huh?

825
01:07:24,080 --> 01:07:25,862
That must suck huge.

826
01:07:25,872 --> 01:07:29,381
Well, it would suck huge,
but I don't live here.

827
01:07:29,391 --> 01:07:31,398
I'm just visiting someone.

828
01:07:31,408 --> 01:07:33,547
Who? Which one?

829
01:07:33,616 --> 01:07:36,805
Beautiful woman with the shock of hair.

830
01:07:36,815 --> 01:07:38,245
The one sitting with her husband?

831
01:07:38,255 --> 01:07:40,709
- You might say that.
- Why wouldn't you?

832
01:07:40,719 --> 01:07:44,374
I wouldn't say that
because I'm her husband.

833
01:07:44,751 --> 01:07:48,236
So why aren't you sitting with her, then?

834
01:07:50,448 --> 01:07:53,547
Just learned to give her some space.

835
01:07:53,616 --> 01:07:55,685
She's in love with that man
she's sitting with.

836
01:07:55,695 --> 01:07:58,151
I don't like to disturb her.

837
01:07:58,224 --> 01:08:00,517
I just like to see her, I suppose.

838
01:08:00,527 --> 01:08:03,975
Make sure she's
doing well, you know?

839
01:08:06,928 --> 01:08:10,328
I suppose that must seem
rather pathetic.

840
01:08:11,504 --> 01:08:13,740
I should be so lucky.

841
01:08:19,504 --> 01:08:21,504
Come on.

842
01:08:44,847 --> 01:08:46,437
She's not here.

843
01:08:46,447 --> 01:08:48,198
She's sick.

844
01:08:48,208 --> 01:08:50,575
He's not here, either.

845
01:09:17,968 --> 01:09:21,351
I brought you a book.

846
01:09:21,423 --> 01:09:23,529
It's all about Iceland.

847
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,893
Thought you might like to take a look at it.

848
01:09:25,903 --> 01:09:27,943
Why, thank you.

849
01:09:29,328 --> 01:09:31,749
Oh, what is it, dear heart?

850
01:09:31,823 --> 01:09:34,671
What is it? Oh, I see.

851
01:09:34,736 --> 01:09:36,875
Here. Here. Here.

852
01:09:36,944 --> 01:09:39,180
Here, here, yes.

853
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:44,709
Do you by any chance have
any influence around here?

854
01:09:44,719 --> 01:09:48,135
I've seen you talking to them.

855
01:09:50,096 --> 01:09:52,201
Oh.

856
01:09:54,896 --> 01:09:56,166
We'll get to see each other.

857
01:09:56,176 --> 01:09:59,787
You'll see. We have to.

858
01:09:59,855 --> 01:10:02,539
I'll come and see you,

859
01:10:02,607 --> 01:10:05,128
and you'll come and see me.

860
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:14,725
You know, I just wish his wife
would hurry up and get here.

861
01:10:14,735 --> 01:10:18,085
I wish she'd get him out of here
and cut the agony short.

862
01:10:18,095 --> 01:10:19,462
Should I stay?

863
01:10:19,472 --> 01:10:22,702
Don't worry. She's not sick, you know.

864
01:10:24,144 --> 01:10:25,638
To keep her company.

865
01:10:25,648 --> 01:10:28,326
Well, they have to learn to get
over these things by themselves.

866
01:10:28,336 --> 01:10:33,096
They've got short memories,
and that's not always so bad.

867
01:10:34,224 --> 01:10:36,224
Okay?

868
01:11:00,496 --> 01:11:04,292
Fiona. Her name is Fiona.

869
01:11:04,369 --> 01:11:05,637
And what's yours?

870
01:11:05,647 --> 01:11:08,845
I don't think I was ever told that.

871
01:11:08,913 --> 01:11:11,182
Oh, I'm sorry. It's Grant.

872
01:11:13,200 --> 01:11:15,567
Hello, Grant.

873
01:11:15,633 --> 01:11:17,633
I'm Marian.

874
01:11:20,976 --> 01:11:23,942
Well, now that we know
each other's name,

875
01:11:23,952 --> 01:11:28,109
I can tell you straight out what I'm thinking.

876
01:11:28,176 --> 01:11:32,910
I don't know if he's still
so stuck on seeing your...

877
01:11:32,976 --> 01:11:34,118
seeing Fiona.

878
01:11:34,128 --> 01:11:36,838
I don't ask him, he doesn't tell me.

879
01:11:36,848 --> 01:11:40,101
But I don't feel like
putting him back in there

880
01:11:40,111 --> 01:11:42,502
in case it turns out
to be more than that.

881
01:11:42,512 --> 01:11:45,062
I don't want him
getting hard to handle.

882
01:11:45,072 --> 01:11:48,585
I don't have any help. It's just me here.

883
01:11:48,656 --> 01:11:49,991
I'm it.

884
01:11:50,001 --> 01:11:51,205
It is very hard for you.

885
01:11:51,215 --> 01:11:54,054
Did... Did you ever consider
his going in there for good?

886
01:11:54,064 --> 01:11:57,097
No. I'm keeping him right here.

887
01:11:57,169 --> 01:11:59,558
Well, that's very good
and noble of you.

888
01:11:59,568 --> 01:12:00,966
Oh, you think so?

889
01:12:00,976 --> 01:12:04,773
Well, noble is not
what I'm thinking about.

890
01:12:04,849 --> 01:12:06,790
No, but it isn't easy.

891
01:12:06,800 --> 01:12:08,870
No, it isn't, but I don't have a choice.

892
01:12:08,880 --> 01:12:12,550
If I pay to put him in there,
I won't hold on to the house,

893
01:12:12,560 --> 01:12:16,555
and the house is the only thing
we own outright.

894
01:12:17,616 --> 01:12:21,391
And it means a lot to me,
this house does.

895
01:12:21,456 --> 01:12:23,456
It's very nice.

896
01:12:24,144 --> 01:12:27,079
Well, I guess it's all right.

897
01:12:27,152 --> 01:12:30,534
I've done a lot on it,
fixing it up, keeping it up.

898
01:12:30,544 --> 01:12:32,423
Yes, I can see
that you have... you do.

899
01:12:32,433 --> 01:12:34,374
- I don't want to lose it.
- No.

900
01:12:34,384 --> 01:12:36,614
- I'm not going to lose it.
- I see your point.

901
01:12:36,624 --> 01:12:38,534
See, the company
left us high and dry.

902
01:12:38,544 --> 01:12:44,077
In the end, they said
he owed them money.

903
01:12:45,584 --> 01:12:50,123
What do I think?
Well, he was pretty stupid.

904
01:12:51,376 --> 01:12:55,337
But I'm not supposed
to ask, so I shut up.

905
01:12:55,408 --> 01:12:56,934
You've been married, huh?

906
01:12:56,944 --> 01:13:01,024
I mean, you are married.
You know what it's like.

907
01:13:01,489 --> 01:13:03,430
And then, in the middle of all this,

908
01:13:03,440 --> 01:13:08,329
he gets sick from this virus,
and he goes into a coma.

909
01:13:13,008 --> 01:13:17,286
So that pretty much
takes him off the hook, hmm?

910
01:13:19,856 --> 01:13:21,856
It's bad luck.

911
01:13:22,481 --> 01:13:25,197
It's, no, just life.

912
01:13:28,496 --> 01:13:30,496
Can't beat life.

913
01:13:31,953 --> 01:13:33,953
No.

914
01:13:44,624 --> 01:13:46,926
Oh. Hello.

915
01:14:27,056 --> 01:14:30,201
Perhaps you'd like me to read to you.

916
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,800
I don't have any books.

917
01:14:35,632 --> 01:14:37,632
Oh, there are some.

918
01:14:39,665 --> 01:14:41,665
<i>Letters from Iceland.</i>

919
01:14:50,736 --> 01:14:53,351
"Isn't it true,
however far we've wandered

920
01:14:53,361 --> 01:14:55,943
"into our provinces
of persecution,

921
01:14:55,953 --> 01:15:00,109
"where our regrets accuse,
we keep returning

922
01:15:00,177 --> 01:15:01,863
"back to the common faith

923
01:15:01,873 --> 01:15:04,294
"from which we've all dissented,

924
01:15:04,304 --> 01:15:07,949
"back to the hands,
the feet, the faces?

925
01:15:08,016 --> 01:15:11,431
"Children are always there
and take the hands,

926
01:15:11,441 --> 01:15:13,351
"even when they are most terrified.

927
01:15:13,361 --> 01:15:17,670
"Those in love cannot
make up their minds to go or stay.

928
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:20,825
"Artist and doctor return most often.

929
01:15:20,849 --> 01:15:24,039
"Only the mad will never,
never come back.

930
01:15:24,049 --> 01:15:26,887
"For doctors keep
on worrying while away,

931
01:15:26,897 --> 01:15:31,337
"in case their skill
is suffering and deserted.

932
01:15:31,409 --> 01:15:35,207
"Lovers have lived so long
with giants and elves,

933
01:15:35,217 --> 01:15:38,698
"they want belief again
in their own size.

934
01:15:38,708 --> 01:15:41,799
"And the artist prays ever so gently,

935
01:15:41,809 --> 01:15:45,354
"'Let me find pure
all that can happen.

936
01:15:45,424 --> 01:15:48,327
"'Only uniqueness is success.

937
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:52,550
"'For instance,
let me perceive the images of history.

938
01:15:52,560 --> 01:15:56,390
"'All that I push away

939

940
01:16:00,624 --> 01:16:03,238
To all the men and women
of the United States Armed Forces

941
01:16:03,248 --> 01:16:05,735
now in the Middle East,
the peace of a troubled world

942
01:16:05,745 --> 01:16:10,983
and the hopes of an oppressed people
now depend on you.

943
01:16:11,057 --> 01:16:12,934
How could they forget Vietnam?

944
01:16:12,944 --> 01:16:15,047
The air strike started again
at 5 A. M. this morning

945
01:16:15,057 --> 01:16:16,999
and lasted for three hours.

946
01:16:17,009 --> 01:16:23,299
Roadside explosions have killed
eight Iraqi civilians and one U.S. soldier.

947
01:16:31,185 --> 01:16:33,185
Here you go.

948
01:16:33,585 --> 01:16:37,495
Next time you do it, just go pick it up, okay?

949
01:16:42,225 --> 01:16:44,551
Her muscles are deteriorating.

950
01:16:44,561 --> 01:16:45,799
If she doesn't improve soon,

951
01:16:45,809 --> 01:16:48,743
we're going to have to
put her on a walker.

952
01:16:48,753 --> 01:16:50,343
I keep trying to get her walking,

953
01:16:50,353 --> 01:16:52,359
but she doesn't seem
to want to go anywhere.

954
01:16:52,369 --> 01:16:55,847
But, you know, once they get on a walker,
they start to depend on it,

955
01:16:55,857 --> 01:16:57,799
and then they don't want
to walk much anymore,

956
01:16:57,809 --> 01:17:00,551
just get wherever it is they have to go.

957
01:17:00,561 --> 01:17:02,535
You're going to have to
work at her harder.

958
01:17:02,545 --> 01:17:04,749
Try and encourage her.

959
01:17:04,817 --> 01:17:06,817
Sorry.

960
01:17:11,505 --> 01:17:13,505
Here you go.

961
01:17:24,656 --> 01:17:26,860
Mrs. Andersson.

962
01:17:26,929 --> 01:17:30,414
How would you like to go on a field trip?

963
01:18:10,097 --> 01:18:13,065
They've kept it so like it was.

964
01:18:15,314 --> 01:18:17,932
Who has?

965
01:18:18,001 --> 01:18:20,172
The people who live here.

966
01:19:27,057 --> 01:19:29,057
But everything...

967
01:19:35,089 --> 01:19:38,385
Everything just reminds me of him.

968
01:19:39,985 --> 01:19:43,728
It wasn't enough, I suppose.

969
01:19:43,793 --> 01:19:45,793
Who, Fiona?

970
01:19:47,250 --> 01:19:50,140
Who does everything remind you of?

971
01:20:07,953 --> 01:20:11,523
I'd like to go home now,
if you don't mind.

972
01:20:16,433 --> 01:20:17,959
Now, as you know,

973
01:20:17,969 --> 01:20:21,000
we don't do extended care
on the first floor.

974
01:20:21,010 --> 01:20:24,967
I mean, we do it temporarily
if someone isn't feeling well.

975
01:20:24,977 --> 01:20:28,523
But if they progress too far,

976
01:20:28,594 --> 01:20:32,368
we have to consider
moving upstairs.

977
01:20:35,602 --> 01:20:38,567
Do you happen to have Aubrey's address?

978
01:20:38,577 --> 01:20:40,577
I'm sorry?

979
01:20:42,961 --> 01:20:46,474
Aubrey and his wife.

980
01:20:46,545 --> 01:20:48,814
Where do they live?

981
01:21:05,074 --> 01:21:09,160
Well, it was probably a mistake
putting him there in the first place,

982
01:21:09,170 --> 01:21:13,992
but I wasn't going to get another chance
to get away, so I took it.

983
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:16,002
Well, so...

984
01:21:17,138 --> 01:21:19,138
Now I know better.

985
01:21:22,225 --> 01:21:24,520
Did your husband ever
work in a hardware store

986
01:21:24,530 --> 01:21:26,728
in the summers
when he was going to school?

987
01:21:26,738 --> 01:21:30,382
No, I never heard about that.

988
01:21:30,450 --> 01:21:32,575
But I wasn't raised here.

989
01:21:33,682 --> 01:21:37,031
No. I didn't think so.

990
01:21:43,697 --> 01:21:47,144
Thank you very much
for your time, Miriam.

991
01:21:47,154 --> 01:21:50,285
It's Marian.

992
01:21:50,354 --> 01:21:52,354
Sorry.

993
01:22:01,042 --> 01:22:03,042
What a jerk.

994
01:22:21,714 --> 01:22:23,752
Yeah, maybe someone
could just drop in on her,

995
01:22:23,762 --> 01:22:24,935
like, if the nurse is around.

996
01:22:24,945 --> 01:22:27,368
All right.

997
01:22:27,442 --> 01:22:29,160
No, I don't think there's much to it,

998
01:22:29,170 --> 01:22:30,921
but I'd like you to call me back.

999
01:22:30,931 --> 01:22:32,808
Okay.

1000
01:22:32,818 --> 01:22:34,891
Thanks a lot. Bye-bye.

1001
01:22:34,962 --> 01:22:36,962
- Hey.
- Hi.

1002
01:22:41,138 --> 01:22:45,545
I think I want to ask you
about the second floor,

1003
01:22:45,618 --> 01:22:48,717
just to know a little more about it.

1004
01:22:48,786 --> 01:22:52,441
Well, it's for people
who've really lost it.

1005
01:22:58,033 --> 01:23:00,684
What do they do, then?

1006
01:23:00,754 --> 01:23:05,194
What happens after that?
After they've... lost it?

1007
01:23:05,266 --> 01:23:07,144
You don't really want to know.

1008
01:23:07,154 --> 01:23:09,191
But, you know,
sometimes they get it back.

1009
01:23:09,201 --> 01:23:11,847
They go into their room for a year,
they don't know you from Adam,

1010
01:23:11,857 --> 01:23:14,248
and then one day, it's,
"Oh, hi. When are we going home?"

1011
01:23:14,258 --> 01:23:16,584
I mean, all of a sudden,
they're back to normal.

1012
01:23:16,594 --> 01:23:18,313
But it doesn't last for long.

1013
01:23:18,323 --> 01:23:20,072
You think,
"Oh, wow, back to normal,"

1014
01:23:20,082 --> 01:23:23,596
and then they're gone again, like so.

1015
01:23:26,355 --> 01:23:29,417
I haven't even asked you
about yourself.

1016
01:23:29,427 --> 01:23:30,663
You married?

1017
01:23:30,673 --> 01:23:34,319
Well, technically, yeah, I guess.

1018
01:23:34,387 --> 01:23:36,387
Got three kids.

1019
01:23:36,402 --> 01:23:39,016
Their dad lives in Alberta, I think.

1020
01:23:39,026 --> 01:23:41,032
He's making it rich, maybe.
I wouldn't know.

1021
01:23:41,042 --> 01:23:43,311
Must be quite a struggle.

1022
01:23:43,378 --> 01:23:47,112
It, uh... knocks the wind
out of you every now and then,

1023
01:23:47,122 --> 01:23:51,627
but you just pick yourself
back up like everyone else.

1024
01:23:52,178 --> 01:23:55,724
I suppose our lives
must seem easy to you.

1025
01:23:55,794 --> 01:23:59,208
We got through life
without too much going wrong.

1026
01:23:59,218 --> 01:24:02,760
What we have to suffer
now, when we're old,

1027
01:24:02,770 --> 01:24:04,168
hardly counts, I suppose.

1028
01:24:04,178 --> 01:24:06,473
That's what you must think.

1029
01:24:10,386 --> 01:24:12,777
Well, how would you
know what I think?

1030
01:24:12,787 --> 01:24:14,632
To tell you the truth, I'd rather be

1031
01:24:14,642 --> 01:24:18,024
the one that stayed
than the one that left.

1032
01:24:18,034 --> 01:24:20,552
I'll bet you weren't always
the doggedly devoted husband.

1033
01:24:20,562 --> 01:24:22,831
Am I right?

1034
01:24:22,897 --> 01:24:26,280
I mean, you said that you wondered

1035
01:24:26,354 --> 01:24:30,478
if maybe she was punishing
you for something?

1036
01:24:30,546 --> 01:24:35,816
I'll bet you had something
pretty specific in mind, didn't you?

1037
01:24:35,889 --> 01:24:41,454
You know, you see a lot
of things in this job.

1038
01:24:41,522 --> 01:24:44,041
You see the end of things
all day long.

1039
01:24:44,051 --> 01:24:46,056
And in my experience,
at the end of things

1040
01:24:46,066 --> 01:24:47,656
it's almost always
the men that think

1041
01:24:47,666 --> 01:24:50,895
that not too much went wrong.

1042
01:24:50,962 --> 01:24:54,362
I wonder if your wife
feels the same way.

1043
01:24:54,962 --> 01:24:56,962
I wonder that, too.

1044
01:24:58,066 --> 01:25:00,074
I bet you do.

1045
01:25:23,475 --> 01:25:24,904
Uh, hello, Grant.

1046
01:25:24,914 --> 01:25:27,304
I hope I got the right person.

1047
01:25:27,314 --> 01:25:29,128
I just thought of something.

1048
01:25:29,138 --> 01:25:33,288
There is a dance here in town
at the Legion on Saturday night,

1049
01:25:33,298 --> 01:25:37,064
and I am on the supper committee,
which means I can bring a free guest.

1050
01:25:37,074 --> 01:25:41,768
So I wondered whether you would
happen to be interested in that.

1051
01:25:41,778 --> 01:25:43,913
Call me back
when you get a chance.

1052
01:25:43,923 --> 01:25:47,501
555-3457.

1053
01:25:50,962 --> 01:25:55,042
I just realized I'd forgotten to say who it was.

1054
01:25:55,091 --> 01:25:58,088
Well, you probably recognize
the voice, the accent.

1055
01:25:58,098 --> 01:25:59,496
It's Marian.

1056
01:25:59,506 --> 01:26:01,865
I'm still not so used
to these machines,

1057
01:26:01,875 --> 01:26:04,680
and I wanted to say
I realize you're not single

1058
01:26:04,690 --> 01:26:06,600
and I don't mean it that way.

1059
01:26:06,610 --> 01:26:08,136
I'm not, either.

1060
01:26:08,146 --> 01:26:11,080
But it doesn't hurt
to get out once in a while.

1061
01:26:11,090 --> 01:26:13,577
Anyway, now I've said all this,

1062
01:26:13,587 --> 01:26:16,168
I really hope
it's you I'm talking to.

1063
01:26:16,178 --> 01:26:18,056
It did sound like your voice.

1064
01:26:18,066 --> 01:26:20,297
If you're interested, you can call me.

1065
01:26:20,307 --> 01:26:23,241
And if you are not,
you don't need to bother.

1066
01:26:23,251 --> 01:26:27,464
I just thought you might
like the chance to get out.

1067
01:26:27,474 --> 01:26:29,474
It's Marian speaking.

1068
01:26:30,994 --> 01:26:33,994
I guess I already said that.

1069
01:26:34,066 --> 01:26:37,100
Okay, then. Good-bye.

1070
01:26:41,267 --> 01:26:42,824
"The desires of the heart

1071
01:26:42,834 --> 01:26:45,353
"are as crooked as corkscrews.

1072
01:26:45,363 --> 01:26:47,624
"Not to be born is the best for man.

1073
01:26:47,634 --> 01:26:51,148
"The second-best
is a formal order.

1074
01:26:51,218 --> 01:26:55,179
The dance's pattern:
dance while you can."

1075
01:27:00,467 --> 01:27:03,401
Fiona?

1076
01:27:03,475 --> 01:27:06,281
Is there any way to let this go...

1077
01:27:06,291 --> 01:27:08,291
do you think?

1078
01:27:12,307 --> 01:27:15,369
If I let it go, it'll only hit me harder

1079
01:27:15,379 --> 01:27:17,589
when I bump into it again.

1080
01:27:22,803 --> 01:27:24,803
Okay.

1081
01:27:28,850 --> 01:27:32,112
"Dance, dance, for the figure is easy.

1082
01:27:32,178 --> 01:27:35,527
The tune is catchy
and will not stop."

1083
01:27:37,523 --> 01:27:39,048
"Dance till the stars

1084
01:27:39,058 --> 01:27:40,937
"come down from the rafters.

1085
01:27:40,947 --> 01:27:44,111
Dance, dance, dance
till you drop."

1086
01:27:50,419 --> 01:27:51,945
Yes?

1087
01:27:51,955 --> 01:27:54,321
Hello, Marian.

1088
01:28:04,147 --> 01:28:06,147
So...

1089
01:28:07,635 --> 01:28:09,635
There you are.

1090
01:28:10,386 --> 01:28:12,386
Here I am.

1091
01:28:14,931 --> 01:28:16,931
Thank you.

1092
01:28:41,299 --> 01:28:43,299
What are you thinking?

1093
01:28:44,883 --> 01:28:47,008
Not an awful lot, really.

1094
01:28:48,627 --> 01:28:50,627
Skiing.

1095
01:28:53,715 --> 01:28:55,715
Downhill?

1096
01:28:57,043 --> 01:28:59,043
Cross-country.

1097
01:29:00,850 --> 01:29:04,462
I'm more a thrill-seeker, I guess.

1098
01:29:09,683 --> 01:29:11,683
What are you thinking?

1099
01:29:12,564 --> 01:29:14,057
I'm thinking you never know

1100
01:29:14,067 --> 01:29:16,872
how things are going to turn out.

1101
01:29:19,411 --> 01:29:22,477
You almost know...

1102
01:29:22,547 --> 01:29:26,344
but you can never be quite sure.

1103
01:30:00,916 --> 01:30:02,916
Mr. Andersson?

1104
01:30:09,203 --> 01:30:10,825
Mr. Andersson?

1105
01:30:10,835 --> 01:30:12,840
Now, as you know, we're, uh,

1106
01:30:12,850 --> 01:30:14,505
we're going to have
to think about moving

1107
01:30:14,515 --> 01:30:17,769
Mrs. Andersson upstairs
fairly soon, I'm afraid.

1108
01:30:17,779 --> 01:30:20,233
She hasn't been out of that bed
for two weeks now, and...

1109
01:30:20,243 --> 01:30:23,659
I'm quite aware of your policies.

1110
01:30:23,731 --> 01:30:27,386
I'm more than aware
of your bloody policies.

1111
01:30:28,499 --> 01:30:32,457
Well, once again, Nurse Kristy is taking me
back to the second floor.

1112
01:30:32,467 --> 01:30:34,473
The area to my right
are the elevators,

1113
01:30:34,483 --> 01:30:38,248
and as we go on down the hall,
there's a man with a broken heart,

1114
01:30:38,258 --> 01:30:39,945
broken in a thousand pieces.

1115
01:30:39,955 --> 01:30:42,057
Well, we'll go to Madeleine's office,
past the lunchroom.

1116
01:30:42,067 --> 01:30:43,881
Hopefully, they're serving right now.

1117
01:30:43,891 --> 01:30:45,353
The cannelloni
was cold yesterday,

1118
01:30:45,363 --> 01:30:46,953
but let's see what it's doing today.

1119
01:30:46,963 --> 01:30:48,873
Let's have... I gotta have
some Cokes again.

1120
01:30:48,883 --> 01:30:51,263
That's what I'm going to do.

1121
01:30:53,395 --> 01:30:57,771
Wouldn't it be better if...

1122
01:30:57,843 --> 01:31:00,713
when we go out again,

1123
01:31:00,788 --> 01:31:03,434
to put Aubrey
back into Meadowlake?

1124
01:31:03,444 --> 01:31:05,810
Just for a day?

1125
01:31:05,875 --> 01:31:07,875
What do you think?

1126
01:31:10,355 --> 01:31:15,058
I'm thinking that sometimes you...

1127
01:31:15,124 --> 01:31:19,532
just have to make
the decision to be happy.

1128
01:31:21,844 --> 01:31:23,844
Just decide.

1129
01:31:25,267 --> 01:31:28,585
Things aren't ever
what you hoped they'd be.

1130
01:31:28,595 --> 01:31:30,595
Not ever, for anybody.

1131
01:31:32,307 --> 01:31:35,913
The only thing that separates
one kind of person from another

1132
01:31:35,923 --> 01:31:39,785
is there are some
who stay angry about it

1133
01:31:39,859 --> 01:31:45,424
and there are some who...
accept what comes their way.

1134
01:31:46,868 --> 01:31:49,673
And which kind of person are you?

1135
01:31:49,683 --> 01:31:53,131
I was pretty mad about it.

1136
01:31:53,203 --> 01:31:56,105
But now...

1137
01:31:56,179 --> 01:32:00,751
looking at what came my way...

1138
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:08,795
I think I could be
the other kind of person.

1139
01:32:10,996 --> 01:32:13,291
Quite the philosopher, huh?

1140
01:32:16,499 --> 01:32:18,186
Look, why don't you pull over here?

1141
01:32:18,196 --> 01:32:22,222
Just... pull over, could you?

1142
01:32:37,459 --> 01:32:39,584
I know what you're doing.

1143
01:32:40,628 --> 01:32:45,549
It would be easier for me
if you could pretend a little.

1144
01:32:47,027 --> 01:32:49,662
Do you think you could do that?

1145
01:33:03,443 --> 01:33:06,225
Now, what were we talking about?

1146
01:33:49,876 --> 01:33:54,057
She was the only one in her family
who bothered to learn sign language.

1147
01:33:54,067 --> 01:33:58,314
Now she can't remember how,
or maybe even who she is.

1148
01:33:58,324 --> 01:33:59,817
Her daughter?

1149
01:33:59,827 --> 01:34:01,482
Yeah.

1150
01:34:01,492 --> 01:34:04,042
It's left her pretty stranded.

1151
01:34:04,052 --> 01:34:06,092
Marooned.

1152
01:34:08,212 --> 01:34:09,834
You know, I thought of you the other day.

1153
01:34:09,844 --> 01:34:11,658
You know that billboard out in front

1154
01:34:11,668 --> 01:34:13,034
of the United Church in Bradford,

1155
01:34:13,044 --> 01:34:16,359
they post all that biblical-type stuff?

1156
01:34:16,372 --> 01:34:19,755
The other day, it said,

1157
01:34:19,827 --> 01:34:20,873
"It's never too late

1158
01:34:20,883 --> 01:34:23,858
to become what you
might have been."

1159
01:34:24,628 --> 01:34:28,304
Doesn't sound all that biblical.

1160
01:34:28,371 --> 01:34:31,941
Well, maybe they're
getting creative on us.

1161
01:35:54,068 --> 01:35:56,272
See you soon, Aubrey.

1162
01:36:35,925 --> 01:36:37,675
Oh, yeah.

1163
01:36:37,685 --> 01:36:39,685
Thanks.

1164
01:36:53,556 --> 01:36:55,556
Thanks.

1165
01:37:47,444 --> 01:37:49,514
Would you mind
if I had a moment alone

1166
01:37:49,524 --> 01:37:51,524
before you come in?

1167
01:37:52,373 --> 01:37:54,577
To explain things to her?

1168
01:38:09,460 --> 01:38:13,256
I found this beautiful book
about Iceland.

1169
01:38:13,333 --> 01:38:16,555
You wouldn't think they'd leave
valuable books lying around.

1170
01:38:16,565 --> 01:38:20,815
People who stay here
aren't all necessarily honest.

1171
01:38:21,685 --> 01:38:26,387
And I think they got
the clothes mixed up.

1172
01:38:26,452 --> 01:38:28,721
I never wear yellow.

1173
01:38:36,916 --> 01:38:40,401
I seem to remember you
reading this to me.

1174
01:38:41,973 --> 01:38:45,203
You were trying
to make me feel better.

1175
01:38:46,581 --> 01:38:49,232
You tried so hard.

1176
01:38:52,693 --> 01:38:55,243
You're a lovely man, you know?

1177
01:38:56,116 --> 01:38:59,313
I'm a very lucky woman.

1178
01:38:59,380 --> 01:39:02,091
- Fiona?
- You've been gone a long time.

1179
01:39:02,101 --> 01:39:03,626
Are we all checked out?

1180
01:39:03,636 --> 01:39:06,539
I have a surprise for you.

1181
01:39:10,677 --> 01:39:12,677
Do you remember Aubrey?

1182
01:39:34,548 --> 01:39:36,621
Names elude me.

1183
01:39:48,885 --> 01:39:51,340
I'm happy to see you.

1184
01:39:56,118 --> 01:39:58,932
You could've just driven away.

1185
01:39:58,997 --> 01:40:04,082
Just driven away
without a care in the world

1186
01:40:04,150 --> 01:40:06,419
and forsook me.

1187
01:40:08,533 --> 01:40:10,533
Forsooken me.

1188
01:40:12,213 --> 01:40:14,213
Forsaken.

1189
01:40:16,021 --> 01:40:18,021
Not a chance.

1191
01:40:19,000 --> 01:40:22,077
