192
00:24:32,442--> 00:24:36,381
...and later we cry and us

But I need current pictures.

222
00:28:36,561--> 00:28:39,611
- I know it, but this
girl has a mark...

223
00:28:39,876--> 00:28:41,004
...from birth in
one of their fingers that...

224
00:28:41,200--> 00:28:42,300
...he/she resembles that of Jenny.

225
00:28:43,488--> 00:28:44,712
I want them to examine their denture.

226
00:28:47,225--> 00:28:48,325
This well.

227
00:28:50,951--> 00:28:52,051
Is .Quién?

228
00:28:52,227--> 00:28:54,678
- The detectives sent
this picture that is possible...

229
00:28:54,825--> 00:28:55,925
...that it agrees with
that of the youth that...

230
00:28:56,001--> 00:28:57,276
...we have in the morgue.

231
00:29:00,397--> 00:29:05,397
- No. They are not their eyes.
Their eyes are clearer.

232
00:29:08,487--> 00:29:10,941
- He/she has the mark of
birth in the hand...

233
00:29:11,148--> 00:29:12,506
...left among those
fingers the same as Jenny.

234
00:29:12,962--> 00:29:14,809
No. It is not Jenny.

235
00:29:15,055--> 00:29:17,504
- He/she looks at the report, they don't have
found any relative.

236
00:29:17,825--> 00:29:21,943
- Those are not their eyes.
- This well.

237
00:30:14,601--> 00:30:15,892
It is difficult to believe that he/she ended.

238
00:30:18,650--> 00:30:19,750
Só, I know it.

239
00:30:40,480--> 00:30:42,351

00:30:52,825--> 00:30:55,141
- Champagne.
- This well.

243
00:30:59,918--> 00:31:01,018
Then, .Por what tonight?...

244
00:31:03,405--> 00:31:04,893

00:31:05,489--> 00:31:06,589

00:31:15,762--> 00:31:16,862
Yes, I believe.

250
00:31:18,108--> 00:31:19,208
It seems that it was not so much.

251
00:31:19,713--> 00:31:21,673
That is good.

252
00:31:23,301--> 00:31:24,401
You don't know what can happen

253
00:31:33,522--> 00:31:34,622
Nobody brought gifts.

254
00:31:37,813--> 00:31:39,608
No. .Tu yes?

255
00:31:41,305--> 00:31:42,605
I believe that you didn't wait this.

256
00:31:44,705--> 00:31:46,028
But it could be amusing.

257
00:31:47,151--> 00:31:48,795
I don't believe that it is that type of gifts.

258
00:31:49,505--> 00:31:52,393
- Yes, it is good to be
outside of the bed...

259
00:31:52,616--> 00:31:53,716
...from time to time.

260
00:31:54,291--> 00:31:55,391
Only in my friends' house.

Or maybe nr.

264
00:32:28,394--> 00:32:29,740
Your eyes are beautiful.

265
00:32:31,623--> 00:32:32,723
They are it.

266
00:32:34,084--> 00:32:35,184
Not this well.

267
00:32:38,598--> 00:32:41,677
- I sit down as if you
I allow to leave you will go far.

268
00:32:47,089--> 00:32:48,329
Then don't allow to leave.

269
00:33:10,615--> 00:33:15,393
Hey. Hello.

270
00:33:31,136--> 00:33:33,453
- Once again, I promise

271
00:33:35,155--> 00:33:37,641
No, no, I am not able to. I have to leave.

272
00:33:38,146--> 00:33:40,159

Non concidieron.

292
00:34:41,124--> 00:34:43,538

...she didn't escape...

319
00:36:43,887--> 00:36:45,482
...she was not attacked by the wolves...

320
00:36:46,024--> 00:36:48,040
...or the head was hit
and he/she forgot their name...

321
00:36:48,375--> 00:36:49,916
...and not you this being

- Some hobre caught it and

324
00:36:54,642--> 00:36:56,813

533
01:03:29,910--> 01:03:31,010
He/she didn't have idea.

534
01:03:33,498--> 01:03:34,598

535
01:03:38,984--> 01:03:40,659
- Maybe it sounds funny but
I will end up late working.

536
01:03:41,281--> 01:03:42,612
Maybe he/she can invite you to eat lunch.

537
01:03:45,422--> 01:03:46,522

538
01:03:48,574--> 01:03:49,674

...your you know you don't drug, non amusement...

541
01:03:55,900--> 01:03:59,244
...he/she wanted to make the things well
and he/she wanted to bring to their daughter...

542
01:03:59,665--> 01:04:01,637
...but he/she didn't have a lot
money for that...

543
01:04:02,019--> 01:04:05,946
...for what had to pay more...

544
01:04:06,590--> 01:04:10,315
...so it got
three works and it was...

545
01:04:10,599--> 01:04:11,913
...working and working
and he/she made it because her...

546
01:04:12,379--> 01:04:15,130

awake because he/she didn't go to be able to...

547
01:04:15,452--> 01:04:17,203
...to get up for the day of their wedding.

548
01:04:17,557--> 01:04:20,009

01:04:26,332--> 01:04:27,875
...I didn't listen again

555
01:04:39,659--> 01:04:44,268
