But first, I wanna be

5
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,925
Momma said I can't dance.

6
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:36,512
Plus, she said, who wants
to see my big ass dancing, anyhow?

7
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:40,265
Well, if there's no volunteers,
then l'm going to have to call people.

00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:53,112

Or somebody's gonna break through to me.

Someday.

21
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,219

Why are we barking, Jess?

who didn't do their homework?

40
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:26,246
Why? These aren't requests.
These are requirements. Okay?

41
00:03:29,918 --> 00:03:32,836
You have to go to the principal's office.

42
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:44,848
Go to the principal's office!

43
00:03:44,933 --> 00:03:47,851

Where was he seen?

45
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,315
Could you get Mr. Tork from Room 25,

Are you pregnant?

00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:51,415
You're 1 6. You're still in junior high school,

60
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:56,128
and you're pregnant with your second child.

00:05:30,246 --> 00:05:31,621
Clareece?

67
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:33,749

Sit down, Clareece. Sit down right now.

We should have a parent-teacher's
conference with you, me and your mother.

71
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,681
My mother's busy.

72
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:52,100
All right. Well then,
how about if I come to your house?

73
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:54,144
lf I were you, I wouldn't.

74
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,938

No, they didn't have it.

00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:02,045
Right there. Yeah. Daddy loves you.

84
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:13,098
Precious, what did you think of the film?

You know, this pageant can do Brenda

And the man in charge, he's tops

A dance teacher.

122
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:59,681

School ain't gonna help none!

00:11:18,552 --> 00:11:21,096
Take your ass down to the welfare.

So I guess you think you cute now, right?
Uppity bitch.

You...
Why would you bring that bitch up in here?

155
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,762
Well, why the fuck did she ring my buzzer?

l can't hear you, Precious.

157
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,726

You're a dummy, bitch,

Don't nobody want you.
Don't nobody need you.

00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,932
and one of them is a goddamn animal,

175
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:51,102
running around,
looking crazy as a motherfucker.

176
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:55,190
Bitch, you know what?
See, I think you... I think you're trying me.

177
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:59,778
l think you're really trying to fuck with me.
You're fucking with my money.

178
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:01,946
And you're gonna stand up there
and look down at me

179
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,615
like you're a motherfucking woman.

180
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:05,658
l'm gonna show you
what real women do, bitch.

181
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,203
See, you don't know
what real motherfucking women do.

182
00:13:08,287 --> 00:13:10,246
Real motherfucking women sacrifice.

183
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,708
l should've aborted your motherfucking ass.
'Cause you ain't shit.

184
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:16,377
l knew it the day the doctors put you
in my goddamn hand

185
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,962
you wasn't a goddamn thing,

186
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:20,340
and you have that smirk
on your face, bitch?

187
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,133
Get it off your fucking face!

188
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:25,804
Now smile about that!
Smile about that, you fat bitch.

189
00:13:29,391 --> 00:13:31,518
l'm gonna kill you, bitch!

190
00:13:41,403 --> 00:13:43,154
Get off me, bitch!

191
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,825
And "bIank" and eggs?

192
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,243
-Bacon?
-Right.

193
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,870
-And "What's up, Doc?" He eats these.
-Carrots.

194
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:54,332
-Right. And ice, it comes in a tray.
-lce cubes.

195
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,335
Right. And the best part of the steak. The...

196
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,878
-The T-bone. The...
-No.

197
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,296
-FiIet mignon.
-Right!

198
00:14:00,381 --> 00:14:03,842
-And an EngIish... Thomas' EngIish...
-Muffin!

199
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,718
-Right.
-That's it!

200
00:14:14,353 --> 00:14:16,813
You really need to get some rest.

201
00:14:16,897 --> 00:14:19,691
You have such a big day
ahead of you tomorrow.

202
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,944
And remember, Mommy loves you.

203
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:31,619
Describe these things that are pIanned.
Things that are planned. Ready? Go!

204
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:37,917
Precious, you know I love you.

205
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,004
l'm gonna kick that white lady
out of my house,

206
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,922

207
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,133
Wanna live in Westchester?

208
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,303
-Commit a...
-Crime.

00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,346
And this is you get back together again.

210
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,472
-A class...
-Reunion.

211
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:53,057
And this is when you're Iike this,

212
00:14:53,142 --> 00:14:54,392
-you're expecting...
-Pregnant.

213
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,936
-Yeah. And this is you make a fast...
-Escape.

214
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,771
-Right.
-That's it!

215
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:35,266
Where you going?

216
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:39,520
Make sure you play my 852
and tell them to box it.

217
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:45,193
And get some kitty litter.

218
00:15:49,573 --> 00:15:51,449
Ethel, where you at?

219
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,621
Precious, what are we gonna play?

220
00:15:56,705 --> 00:15:57,705
Girl, get the fuck out of here.

221
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,248
Ain't you supposed to be
at school or something?

222
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,959
You said we was gonna play.

223
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:03,169
That's exactly why
we ain't gonna be playing.

224
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:04,837
l never said nothing like that.

225
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:10,695
You would say some shit like that to me,
and you don't even mean it?

226
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:14,949
No, l'm not playing with you.
No, and she call... Hold on.

227
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:18,411
Each One Teach One, hold, please.

228
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:22,415
Yes. She called my house.
l know it wasn't your sister, Trey.

229
00:17:23,083 --> 00:17:25,043
Because it wasn't her.

230
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,506
What this is here?

231
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,467
Each One Teach One.

232
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,386
l'm looking for an alternative school.

233
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,263
This is an alternative.

234
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:39,474
What alternative is?

235
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,018
What exactly are you asking me?

236
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:44,145
Lady at my other school
told me to come here.

237
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:47,565
Hotel Theresa.
Said it's an alternative school.

238
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:53,696
An alternative school, it's like a choice.
lt's a different way of doing things.

239
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:57,450
So, I need your discharge papers
saying that they discharged you.

240
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:00,453
l got kicked out of school
'cause I was pregnant.

241
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,414
Well, I still need your discharge papers,
otherwise we can't let you in.

242
00:18:03,499 --> 00:18:05,541
Ms. Lichenstein didn't say all that.

243
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,960
You the one she called about.

244
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:11,506
Clareece P. Jones?

245
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:15,343
They already sent over
your discharge papers and stuff.

246
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,053
l could start today?

247
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:20,473
Yeah. Are you currently receiving AFDC?

248
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,601
My mother get AFDC
for me and my daughter.

249
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,896
So your mother has custody of you and
your daughter, and you're on her budget?

250
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:29,941
Okay, well, l'm gonna need a copy
of your mother's budget,

251
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:33,027
and a copy of your phone bill
and your utility bill.

252
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,405
We gotta give you a few tests,
test your reading and your math level,

253
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:38,157
see where to place you.

254
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,661
Hold on, baby. Each One Teach One, hold.

255
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:47,125
To enter into the GED classes,
you gotta get an 8.0 or better on the TABE.

256
00:19:18,574 --> 00:19:21,742
There's aIways something wrong
with these tests.

257
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:25,955
These tests paint a picture of me
with no brain.

258
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,333
These tests paint a picture
of me and my mother,

259
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,878
my whoIe famiIy, as Iess than dumb.

260
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:36,048
Just ugIy, bIack grease to be wiped away,
find anotherjob for.

261
00:19:37,801 --> 00:19:40,052
Sometimes I wish I was dead.

262
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:45,433
I'II be okay, I guess, 'cause I'm Iooking up.

263
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:50,188
I'm Iooking up for a piano to faII.

264
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:54,233
Or a desk, couch, TV... Momma, maybe.

265
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:57,445
AIways something in my way.

266
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,780
Yeah, man.

267
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,116
Yo, make sure you get that
for me, too, man.

268
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,701
Alternative.

269
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:05,786
Man, you gotta stop smoking
them shits, man.

270
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:08,164
That ain't the only thing
that's gonna fucking kill you.

271
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,124
Hustling in these streets gonna kill you.

272
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:12,168
lt is what it is.

273
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,337
Then my mind come back down to Earth.

274
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:17,965
Let me get some of that sweet ass, orca!

275
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,467
What up, mama?

276
00:20:19,551 --> 00:20:21,594
Why boys aIways grabbing on themseIves?

277
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:25,514
You heard what the fuck I said?
l said give me some fucking ass.

278
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,392
l'm serious!
When you gonna let me hit that?

279
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:29,518
That bitch is laughing...

280
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,978
I wish they'd Ieave me aIone.

281
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,064
-She's stupid.
-Yeah.

282
00:20:35,734 --> 00:20:37,610
Yo, that's not even funny.

283
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,488
That's what she'd get anyway, no.

284
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:44,492
Precious!

285
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:47,239
Ma, I need some money!

286
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,162
Ma, l'm hungry!

287
00:22:55,248 --> 00:22:57,792
Come take care of Mommy, Precious.

288
00:23:02,839 --> 00:23:05,091
I wish she'd stop this shit.

289
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,100
The other day I cried.

290
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:18,854
I feIt stupid. But you know what?

291
00:23:19,398 --> 00:23:21,065
Fuck that day.

292
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:26,195
That's why God, or whoever,
makes new days.

293
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:28,656
Still hungry, though.

294
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:36,831
Nigger wants me to leave my kids.

295
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:39,542
They're my kids.

296
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:45,589
-What d'you want, baby?
-Give me a basket, please.

297
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,508
-Sides?
-l don't know yet.

298
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:51,220
Still thinking about it.
Trying to watch my figure.

299
00:23:55,058 --> 00:23:58,060
Butchie, you got a 1 0-piece ready?

Hell, no, she didn't!

Get her ass! Get that big bitch!

304
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:10,049

You in ABE?

306
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,495
Yeah.

307
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,873
Time's a-wasting.

308
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:49,898

309
00:26:50,734 --> 00:26:52,192

You guys know
that you are in the ABE class.

316

This is not GED.
This is to get you ready for your GED.

317
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,380
These journals are very important
to this class, so do not forget them.

318
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,840
You will need to use them every day
that you are here.

319
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,384
They are the key to this class.

320
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,802
lt's 9:07, Joann. You're late.

You're the one who said breakfast is
the most important meal of the day.

00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:05,557

00:29:18,047 --> 00:29:20,632
Before she get sick,
she teach me everything.

345
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:24,553
So l'm here to get my reading up,
so I can get my GED.

346
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:33,353
My name is Rita Romero.
l was born here in Harlem.

347
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:38,692
l'm here 'cause I was an addict
and I dropped out of school.

348
00:29:39,527 --> 00:29:42,654
So I never got
my reading and writing together.

349
00:29:43,198 --> 00:29:44,990
My favorite color's black.

350
00:29:45,074 --> 00:29:46,450
What do you do good?

351
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:49,286
"Well," Joann. "What do you do well?"

352
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:52,289
-What do I do well?
-No. Rita?

353
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,626
l'm a good mother. Very good mother.

354
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:02,090
My name's Jermaine.
My favorite color is red.

355
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:04,301
Tell us where you were born first.

356
00:30:04,385 --> 00:30:07,554
l was born in the Bronx. Still live there.

357
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:11,558
My favorite color is red. Used to be blue.

358
00:30:12,936 --> 00:30:15,145
l can dance real good.

359
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,439
Homie of mine told me
about Each One Teach One,

360
00:30:17,524 --> 00:30:20,275
so I came here to stay out of trouble.

361
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,153
So you came here to Harlem
to stay out of trouble? ls that right?

362
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:24,613
Yeah.

363
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:27,366
-Consuelo?
-This is bullshit.

364
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:28,992
You think so?

365
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:35,123
Clareece?

366
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:39,419
Can I skip, too?

367
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:42,881
Joann?

368
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:46,426
Okay. l'm Joann. Hey.

369
00:30:49,055 --> 00:30:51,265
My favorite color is fluorescent beige

370
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:54,226
and my ambition is to have
my own record layer.

371
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,352
What's a record layer?

372
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:58,355
Tell us where you come from
and why you come to this school.

373
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,399
l was born in Kings County Hospital,

374
00:31:00,483 --> 00:31:02,901
but my mother moved us to Harlem
when I was nine.

375
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:08,031
l'm here to get my GED, and then...
Well, l'm already into the music industry.

376
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:11,702
l'm just trying to take care of
this little education thing so I can move up.

377
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:16,832
Let's begin. This is ABE.

378
00:31:16,916 --> 00:31:18,250
Can I go?

379
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,134
l wish I could sit
in the back of the cIass again.

380
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:39,688
My name Clareece "Precious" Jones.

381
00:31:40,815 --> 00:31:42,566
l go by Precious.

382
00:31:44,319 --> 00:31:47,696
l live in Harlem. I like yellow.

383
00:31:48,781 --> 00:31:54,828
And I had problems at my other school,
so I come here.

384
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,082
Something you do well?

385
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:02,961
Nothing.

386
00:32:03,671 --> 00:32:06,006
Everybody's good at something.

387
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,469
Come on.

388
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:17,809
Well, I can cook. And...

389
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:23,065
l never really talked in class before.

390
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,196
How does that make you feel?

391
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:37,746
Here.

392
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,543
lt makes me feel here.

393
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:48,006
Everybody open theirjournal.

394
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:52,135
Write the date at the top of the page,
and write.

395
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,931
l don't care if you spell everything wrong.

396
00:32:56,015 --> 00:32:58,141
l don't care if it's grammatically incorrect.
But just write.

397
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,935
Write anything that you're feeling.

398
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,354
This class will be a revolving door.

399
00:33:02,438 --> 00:33:05,607
Some of you will make it
and some of you won't.

400
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,069
Fifteen minutes. Go.

401
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:17,077
Before, I got a A-minus at EngIish,
and I didn't have to say nothing.

402
00:33:18,371 --> 00:33:22,499
Ms. Rain said we gonna read
and write in our notebooks every day.

403
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:24,751
How we supposed to do that?

404
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:30,340
But then she see the worry on my face
and she say,

405
00:33:30,425 --> 00:33:33,593
"The Iongest journey
begin with a singIe step."

406
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:38,890
Whatever the fuck that's supposed to mean.

407
00:33:40,018 --> 00:33:41,518
Come on, come on, do the work.

408
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:45,022
You love it, love it, learn it.

409
00:33:46,065 --> 00:33:47,482
Consuelo?

410
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:50,110
"C" for Consuelo.

411
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,320
"C" for kick your ass.

412
00:33:52,405 --> 00:33:54,740
lt's "K" for kick your ass, stupid.

413
00:33:54,824 --> 00:33:56,825
l got the "D," Ms. Rain.

414
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:02,664
"D" for dick.

415
00:34:03,499 --> 00:34:05,625
Ms. Rain, tell this little-ass bitch
that she don't know me.

416
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,669
Which you wish you had.

417
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,095
-Help her.
-"E."

418
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:21,808
"E."

419
00:34:48,336 --> 00:34:49,878
"F" for fat.

420
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:52,547
What?

421
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,174
Good.

422
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,847
Hey! Hey! Hey! Quit it! Hey!

423
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,850
-What?
-Hey, you stop it right now!

424
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,477
-You fucking...
-Quit it!

425
00:35:05,561 --> 00:35:06,686
-She just hit me!
-Drop it!

426
00:35:06,771 --> 00:35:07,896
Shut the fuck up!

427
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:10,232
She just slapped me!

428
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:11,650
Get out.

429
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:14,986
We don't fight in my class. Sit down.

430
00:35:19,867 --> 00:35:21,701
"C" for cold.

431
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:33,255
Do you live with anybody?

432
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,007
My mother.

433
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,385
What does she do?

434
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,430
She don't do nothing.

435
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:48,895
l want you to read a page from this book.

436
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,321
Try.

437
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:03,910
All I need you to do is sound out
these words for me.

438
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,537
You don't have to know every word.

439
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:09,332
You just have to... lt doesn't matter
if you stumble or... Try for me...

440
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:13,545
...or trip up on it.
You just need to say what you know.

441
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:17,257
Come on. You can do this.
Try. Take it word by word.

442
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,926
-Are you listening to me?
-Precious!

443
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:23,013
l just wanna know where you are
in your reading skills.

444
00:36:23,097 --> 00:36:24,389
'Cause l'm looking at your test scores...

445
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:26,975
Some higher fucking learning.
You're a dumb bitch!

446
00:36:27,059 --> 00:36:28,685
Try to read, okay?

447
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,104
Just heIp me and then I can heIp you.

448
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,607
We'll start from scratch. Word for word.

449
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:36,234
l want you better than your mother.

450
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:39,696
-l'm gonna call the nurse.
-No.

451
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:47,120
lt all look the same to me.

452
00:36:50,791 --> 00:36:52,375
What's this?

453
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:57,130
l can't do that, Ms. Rain.

454
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,841
Push yourself.

455
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:03,637
A.

456
00:37:05,473 --> 00:37:06,890
What's this word?

457
00:37:12,104 --> 00:37:14,940
Do you know the letters? Come on.

458
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:17,651
"D."

459
00:37:20,905 --> 00:37:22,280
"A."

460
00:37:23,866 --> 00:37:25,242
"Y."

461
00:37:25,993 --> 00:37:27,994
Do you know that word?

462
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,706
"Day."

463
00:37:33,834 --> 00:37:35,627
What word is that?

464
00:37:37,672 --> 00:37:39,506
Ate. Ate.

465
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,008
Good. Almost. The word is "At."

466
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:45,053
"At."

467
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:48,932
"The."

468
00:37:51,644 --> 00:37:52,727
Sound it out.

469
00:37:52,812 --> 00:37:54,312
"Beach."

470
00:37:54,397 --> 00:37:57,524
The word is "Shore."
lt's almost like "Beach."

471
00:37:58,234 --> 00:37:59,693
Very good.

472
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:02,862
Now, read the whole thing for me.

473
00:38:04,865 --> 00:38:06,032
"A

474
00:38:07,576 --> 00:38:08,994
"Day

475
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,748
"At The

476
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,209
"Shore."

477
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,052
Get your big ass in here.

478
00:38:38,733 --> 00:38:41,026
Where was you at this morning?

479
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,201
You hear me talking to you?
Where was you at this morning?

480
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,662
School. I was at school.

481
00:38:52,747 --> 00:38:54,164
You a lying whore.

482
00:38:54,248 --> 00:38:56,249
-l'm not lying.
-You is.

483
00:38:56,834 --> 00:38:59,336
The welfare done called here saying
they gonna remove you from my budget

484
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,296
'cause you ain't been
attending school regularly.

485
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,089
l told you I got kicked out.

486
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,216
l been home nearly every day
for two weeks now.

487
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:08,678
You ain't told me nothing
about no damn school today.

488
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,765
l told you I was going
to school this morning.

489
00:39:13,434 --> 00:39:16,644
You plan on putting some food
in that frying pan?

490
00:39:22,151 --> 00:39:24,486
Precious, you got something
you wanna say?

491
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,696
-No.
-Then don't be slamming shit down in here.

492
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,365
You understand?

493
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:30,742
Yes, ma'am.

494
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:35,872
You need to forget about that school shit
and take your ass down to the welfare.

495
00:39:35,956 --> 00:39:37,791
l'm getting a stipend from school.

496
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,085
Fool, what the fuck is a stipend?
What is that?

497
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:43,755
Fuck a stipend.
l said take your ass down to the welfare.

498
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:44,964
Right now?

499
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:48,718
Why in the fuck would you go right now?
lt's at nighttime. Shit is closed.

500
00:39:48,803 --> 00:39:50,053
You gotta be there by 7:00 a.m.

501
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:52,722
in the morning
if you wanna talk to somebody.

502
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:54,432
Fucking stupid.

503
00:39:58,104 --> 00:40:01,773
You think you're too good now?
ls that what it is?

504
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:05,485
You think you is too good for the welfare?

505
00:40:08,739 --> 00:40:13,118
There's more white folk getting assistance
than it is niggers, Ms. Onassis.

506
00:40:14,954 --> 00:40:16,538
I think I said therapy...

507
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:20,375
Hurry your ass up.
l am in here fucking starving.

508
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:22,752
Now what you gonna do
if I die of starvation?

509
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,004
Where you gonna go after that?

510
00:40:26,173 --> 00:40:28,133
l forgot. School.

511
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:32,429
Each... What that bitch say?
Each one do what?

512
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,597
Each one teach one?

513
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,141
Well, they don't know
who the fuck they teaching,

514
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:38,393
'cause you can't learn shit.

515
00:40:38,936 --> 00:40:41,813
Keep on listening to them white people.

516
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:44,566
That's what's gonna get you fucked up.

517
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:49,404
Precious, l'm hungry.

518
00:41:15,389 --> 00:41:19,225
You ain't cooked no collard greens
with the fucking pigs' feet?

519
00:41:19,727 --> 00:41:22,729
Like, how am I supposed to eat pigs' feet
with no collard greens?

520
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:26,649
And why in the fuck does that pigs' feet

521
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:30,028
You eat it. You come eat this shit.

522
00:41:30,112 --> 00:41:32,405
-l'm not hungry, though.
-Yes, you is.

523
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:35,658
Precious, if you don't get

Hurry up and eat, Precious.

00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:55,470
And don't let it get cold,
'cause cold-ass pigs' feet is nasty as shit.

527
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:07,352
So, tell me about...
Tell me about your home life.

00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:12,899
Ain't nothing to really talk about.

529
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:15,902
You're in a safe place. Just talk.

530
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,236
What's going on?

531
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:18,655
What's the first thing
that comes to your mind

532
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,865
when you think about home?

533
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:24,661
l just wish I had my own TV,
so I could watch it in my room.

534
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:28,956
lf I had my own TV,
l wouldn't have to watch it with my mother.

535
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,834
And what's it like,
watching TV with your mother?

536
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:34,671
You enjoy watching TV with your mother?

537
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:39,759
l need to know about your home life.
l need to know what it's like where you live.

538
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:42,887
My mother's like a whale on the couch.

539
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:46,974
She say I eat all the time,
but she always making me eat.

540
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:49,268
Then she call me a fat mess.

541
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:52,480
She say the apartment
is little 'cause of me.

542
00:44:52,564 --> 00:44:55,358
Only time she ever leaves
is to play her numbers.

543
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:58,361
l feel like I could just sit in the house
with her every day,

544
00:44:58,445 --> 00:44:59,862
the shades drawn,

545
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:04,158
watch TV, eat, watch TV, eat again.

546
00:45:05,035 --> 00:45:07,286
Can you help out with that?

547
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:11,165
Can we talk about something else now?

548
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:19,382
How about your firstborn?

549
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:20,800
Mongo?

550
00:45:22,636 --> 00:45:24,721
Mongo is her... ls that...

551
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:28,057

552
00:45:28,934 --> 00:45:33,271
ls that what you call her? Or that's...
What is that? A nickname?

553
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:35,898
She got Down's syndrome.

554
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,074
How you doing, Precious?

555
00:45:45,159 --> 00:45:47,744
My grandmother Toosie

557
00:45:53,667 --> 00:45:55,710
Answer the fucking door.

558
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,630
Do you see what you did? God damn it.

559
00:45:59,715 --> 00:46:03,009
Then my mother gets money
and the food stamps for me and Mongo.

560
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:04,510
Who is it?

561
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:06,721

They come at night.
They tell me l'm one of them.

They say, "Precious, you belong with us."

00:50:33,447 --> 00:50:35,948
And then they go downstairs

"that aII men are created equaI."

676
00:53:08,268 --> 00:53:10,519
No fear. That's bullshit. That's bullshit.

Sit down.

696
00:53:59,945 --> 00:54:01,237
Did anybody do this assignment?

697
00:54:01,321 --> 00:54:03,822
Momma say this schooI ain't shit.

he was the cutest one."

-That's all I got so far.
-That's a good beginning.

707
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:48,617
Thinking about IittIe Mongo, too. I miss her.

708
00:54:48,994 --> 00:54:50,452
That's how you start a fairytale.

709
00:54:50,537 --> 00:54:52,830
I'm happy my baby coming up.

He heaIthy. His mother Iove him.

Where it from?

722

Can you bring me something?
l don't like fruit. I like McDonald's.

726
00:56:32,389 --> 00:56:34,598
First of all, I don't eat McDonald's.

727
00:56:34,682 --> 00:56:37,351
Second of all, you don't need
to be eating McDonald's, either.

728
00:56:37,435 --> 00:56:38,477
lt's not healthy.

729
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:40,771
But I like McDonald's.
We all like McDonald's, right?

730
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:43,482
We like McDonald's, too, over here.

Well, I tell you what,

00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:53,784
and you go to McDonald's,

736
00:56:53,868 --> 00:56:55,744
and you get as much
McDonald's as you want.

737
00:56:55,829 --> 00:56:58,288
But right now,
you're gonna take care of your health.

738
00:56:58,373 --> 00:57:00,082
Are you a doctor?

-You've never seen a male nurse?
-No.

745
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:17,433
Not looking like you do.

746

747
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:25,023

Tough gal like you had to scream?

Not so tough with a baby coming out of me.
lt hurt. And it burned.

-Why you asking? He don't want you.
-How would you know?

757
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:44,460
Why don't you stop being a ho
for 1 0 minutes?

758
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:45,711
What's wrong with these people?

759
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:47,171
You don't want her, right?

760
00:57:47,255 --> 00:57:50,048

Okay, no. I gotta go. I gotta go.

763
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:58,557
No, that's all right. That's all right.

00:58:01,811 --> 00:58:03,770
Can I get a kiss, too, Nurse John?

Use that for Nurse John.

l... J... K...

854
01:09:14,733 --> 01:09:16,317
l'm tired of shopping.

855
01:09:16,402 --> 01:09:18,361
Yes, because they all trying
to take your money.

856
01:09:18,445 --> 01:09:20,321
They don't...

857
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:32,876
l'm calling the cops.

858
01:09:38,090 --> 01:09:40,592
Tell me what you see back there.

859
01:09:52,980 --> 01:09:57,483
I couId teII by Ms. Rain's face
I ain't gonna be homeIess no more.

860
01:09:57,568 --> 01:09:59,611
I just don't know
where I'm gonna end up, though.

861
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:01,279
l'll hold.

862
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,949
l feel bad for her.

863
01:10:05,034 --> 01:10:08,786
She just an ABC teacher.
She ain't no social worker.

864
01:10:10,414 --> 01:10:11,664
What's going on?

865
01:10:11,749 --> 01:10:12,916
But she all I could think of.

866
01:10:13,000 --> 01:10:15,460
Look, when the others get here,
tell them to start writing.

867
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:17,712
And whichever one of you is older
is in charge, okay?

868
01:10:17,796 --> 01:10:19,464
Consuelo, I know that's not you.
Come here.

869
01:10:19,548 --> 01:10:21,674
Ms. Rain, I can't stay. l'm serious.
l've tried to talk...

870
01:10:21,759 --> 01:10:24,344
Consuelo, you're not leaving class
and l'm not dealing with this right now.

871
01:10:24,428 --> 01:10:26,763
Take this money.
Go get something for Precious to wear.

872
01:10:26,847 --> 01:10:29,307
Quick. And bring back my change.

873
01:10:29,391 --> 01:10:33,102
Sixteen years old. A three-day-old infant.

874
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:35,855
The baby not bleeding.
l think this is Precious' blood.

875
01:10:35,940 --> 01:10:38,816
Well, why didn't you tell me that before?

876
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:42,612
We'll find you a place to live.

877
01:10:45,824 --> 01:10:47,533
Joann, you're late.

878
01:10:47,618 --> 01:10:49,827
Rhonda, you ain't the teacher.

879
01:10:49,954 --> 01:10:52,288
Joann, Ms. Rain is busy
with Precious today,

880
01:10:52,373 --> 01:10:54,499
so I am the teacher today.

881
01:10:54,583 --> 01:10:56,459
Okay. Why?

882
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:58,670
-Where's Precious?
-Just sit. Pull out your notebook.

883
01:10:58,754 --> 01:11:01,172
Joann, you wanna say one of your raps
to the baby?

884
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:02,674
What's the baby doing here?

885
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:04,467
-Joann's gonna rap for you.
-Let me see.

886
01:11:04,677 --> 01:11:06,970
She all right. She's doing good.

887
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,640
Why is the baby wrapped up
in a blood-covered blanket?

888
01:11:10,724 --> 01:11:13,476
-Joann, what's so funny?
-For real. What happened?

889
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,978
You don't wanna know is
how it got on the blanket.

890
01:11:15,062 --> 01:11:16,145
You know what your problem is, Joann?

891
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:18,022
That you can't take anything
serious enough.

892
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,525
-Jermaine, me expect better from you.
-Okay, Rhonda.

893
01:11:20,609 --> 01:11:23,152
Joann, stop laughing at this baby.

894
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:26,114
Queens.

895
01:11:28,450 --> 01:11:30,201
Let me call you back.

896
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:31,577
Just tell me what happened!

897
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:32,996
No, it's not funny.

898
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,915
But Joann, there's nothing funny
about a baby with blood on it.

899
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,792
l got a West lndian friend
who's a Council member.

900
01:11:37,876 --> 01:11:40,003
Let me see what she can do.
Hold on a second.

901
01:11:40,087 --> 01:11:43,381
l found a lesson plan in our notebooks.
We're gonna...

902
01:11:44,925 --> 01:11:46,634
Clareece Jones.

903
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:49,012
Hey, Ms. Lisa. How you been?

904
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:51,055
l don't know.

905
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:55,059
l went to see that movie, Barfly, last night.
Piece of shit.

906
01:11:56,061 --> 01:11:59,188
-l'm sorry.
-lt's on my desk. Can you hold?

907
01:11:59,273 --> 01:12:01,566
Something's wrong with you, Precious.

908
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:03,192
This baby stink.

909
01:12:03,277 --> 01:12:05,570
Well, we don't have a Pamper,
so have a seat with the baby.

910
01:12:05,654 --> 01:12:08,323
-l am sitting.
-ln your seat, please.

911
01:12:08,407 --> 01:12:10,491
The first thing

912
01:12:10,576 --> 01:12:16,247
is shut the bumba-ros-clot...

913
01:12:17,124 --> 01:12:19,625
Ms. Rain, why did you let Rhonda
teach the class?

914
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:21,336
She don't even know how to speak English.

915
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:22,462
Let Rhonda take over.

916
01:12:22,546 --> 01:12:26,174
-Shut the bumba-ros-clot up.
-What the fuck is a "ros clot"?

917
01:12:26,258 --> 01:12:28,176
Yeah, Brenda, you there?

918
01:12:28,260 --> 01:12:30,845
The last four of the Social are...

919
01:12:30,929 --> 01:12:33,514
2-4-2-1 .

920
01:12:33,599 --> 01:12:35,725
-Rita?
-l just wanna know how to spell "Aquarius."

921
01:12:35,809 --> 01:12:38,686
-Anybody know how to spell "Aquarius"?
-lt's A-Q-U-A-R-l-U-S.

922
01:12:38,771 --> 01:12:39,979
Can you spell "boy" then?

923
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:41,314
Can you spell "slut" then?

924
01:12:41,398 --> 01:12:43,024
Let's explore that.

925
01:12:43,108 --> 01:12:46,444
You wanna spell "slut," Consuelo,
l'll give you the first letter.

926
01:12:46,528 --> 01:12:48,654
Can you spell "illegal immigrant," then?

927
01:12:48,739 --> 01:12:50,782
Great, thank you.

928
01:12:52,368 --> 01:12:54,869
Can you please use "slut" in a sentence?

929
01:12:54,953 --> 01:12:56,329
Consuelo is a slut...

930
01:12:56,413 --> 01:12:59,207
-You the one who's the ho up in here...
-Joann is not a slut.

931
01:12:59,291 --> 01:13:01,667
Perfect. You get a gold star.

932
01:13:03,504 --> 01:13:05,213
But you know she likes that.

933
01:13:05,297 --> 01:13:07,590
Well, she's just insecure.

934
01:13:07,674 --> 01:13:09,300
-You think?
-Yeah.

935
01:13:09,802 --> 01:13:13,388
-That chicken was good.
-Really good. Did you have enough?

936
01:13:13,472 --> 01:13:15,390
There ain't more, is there?

937
01:13:15,474 --> 01:13:17,141
-ls there more?
-Yeah.

938
01:13:17,476 --> 01:13:19,769
Maybe later. Not now.

939
01:13:19,853 --> 01:13:21,813
l don't want you to think l'm greedy.

940
01:13:21,897 --> 01:13:24,232
You're not greedy.
lf you're hungry, let's get you some more.

941
01:13:24,316 --> 01:13:27,485
l guess I kind of eat
too much sometimes, though.

942
01:13:27,569 --> 01:13:28,820
No, you don't.

943
01:13:28,904 --> 01:13:30,780
-Blu, is that you?
-Not always.

944
01:13:30,864 --> 01:13:32,949
What are you doing here?

945
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:36,077
l live here. Why didn't you tell me?

946
01:13:36,161 --> 01:13:38,955
-Hey, sweetie.
-ls this... ls this...

947
01:13:40,541 --> 01:13:42,750
This is Katherine, Precious.

948
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:44,877
-Are you okay?
-lt's so nice to meet you, finally.

949
01:13:44,962 --> 01:13:48,381
Oh, my God. These straight-up lesbians.

950
01:13:48,465 --> 01:13:52,051
-This is Abdul.
-He's gorgeous. He looks just like you.

951
01:13:53,095 --> 01:13:54,429
Precious, can I hold him?

952
01:13:54,513 --> 01:13:56,264
You know how to?

953
01:13:56,348 --> 01:13:58,349
They stiII nice enough
to Iet us stay in their home

954
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:00,768
untiI I get situated, though.

955
01:14:00,853 --> 01:14:04,939
-He's heavy. Oh, my God!
-You wanna hold him?

956
01:14:05,023 --> 01:14:07,525
I guess this is how the peopIes
on TV feel at Christmastime.

957
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:10,194
-Don't drop him.
-Come on. I only work with children.

958
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:11,320
You know how you are. I saw you...

959
01:14:11,405 --> 01:14:13,448
When we were putting up the tree,
you dropped half the top of it.

960
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:15,116
They're so nice to me and AbduI.

961
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,285
-Be careful. Hold him with both hands.
-Please.

962
01:14:17,369 --> 01:14:19,078
Oh, Abdul.

963
01:14:21,039 --> 01:14:23,207
Merry Christmas, Precious.

964
01:14:24,042 --> 01:14:25,168
Thank you.

965
01:14:25,252 --> 01:14:26,586
Why peopIes that bareIy know me

966
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:30,006
should be nicer to me
than my mother and my father?

967
01:14:30,632 --> 01:14:32,049
l felt warm.

968
01:14:32,384 --> 01:14:33,593
-What?
-l'm just...

969
01:14:33,677 --> 01:14:36,846
l'm just concerned about the baby
and the cats upstairs.

970
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:38,097
They're fine.

971
01:14:38,182 --> 01:14:40,183
Grandmother's scared of Momma.

972
01:14:40,267 --> 01:14:42,685
I know that's why
she ain't Ietting me stay with her.

973
01:14:42,769 --> 01:14:44,687
lf Ronald McDonald were running things...

974
01:14:44,771 --> 01:14:47,565
Ms. Rain say don't be afraid of nothing.

975
01:14:48,233 --> 01:14:50,693
l bet she ain't scared of Momma.

976
01:14:50,777 --> 01:14:53,404
Wouldn't you be a little bit suspicious?

977
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:54,739
Just write the book.

978
01:14:54,823 --> 01:14:58,075
-Well, who's gonna read it?
-Nobody, if you don't write it.

979
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:01,704
You know, Precious writes every day.
You should try it.

980
01:15:01,788 --> 01:15:05,041
ls that right?
What do you write about, Precious?

981
01:15:05,834 --> 01:15:07,084
Stuff.

982
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:10,588
My life. Abdul.

983
01:15:13,008 --> 01:15:15,176
How come y'all don't like McDonald's?

984
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:17,094
Katherine was just drawing a comparison

985
01:15:17,221 --> 01:15:19,263
so that her point could be
more easily understood.

986
01:15:19,348 --> 01:15:20,348
Yes.

987
01:15:20,432 --> 01:15:22,934
They taIk Iike TV channeIs I don't watch.

988
01:15:23,018 --> 01:15:24,393
My Uncle Clayton.

989
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:27,939
I'm gIad AbduI here to Iisten in on them,
though, 'cause I know they're smart.

990
01:15:28,023 --> 01:15:29,440
Before he got saved,

991
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:32,193
he used to smoke like a chimney
and drink like a fish.

992
01:15:32,277 --> 01:15:34,320
I don't understand a word they're saying.

993
01:15:34,404 --> 01:15:35,988
You understand?

994
01:15:39,576 --> 01:15:41,035
Y'all be watching Oprah?

995
01:15:41,119 --> 01:15:44,038
No. I don't, actually.
You know what time I get home from work.

996
01:15:44,122 --> 01:15:47,250
-l watch it.
-Momma say homos is bad peopIes.

997
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,378
But Momma,
homos not ones who raped me.

998
01:15:50,462 --> 01:15:52,755
And what do that make you?

999
01:15:52,839 --> 01:15:56,968
Homos not ones who let me sit in class
aII them years and never Iearn nothing.

1000
01:15:57,052 --> 01:15:59,929
The homos not ones who sell crack
to peopIes in Harlem.

1001
01:16:00,013 --> 01:16:02,014
-...that I have ever seen. Tell her!
-That doesn't work.

1002
01:16:02,099 --> 01:16:04,684
l wonder what Oprah got to say about that.

1003
01:16:04,768 --> 01:16:07,144
Ms. Rain is the one
who put the chaIk in my hand,

1004
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:09,689
made me queen of the ABC's.

1005
01:16:12,651 --> 01:16:14,569
After I settIed at the haIfway house,

1006
01:16:14,653 --> 01:16:17,071
I worked my hardest
to memorize Ietter sounds,

1007
01:16:17,155 --> 01:16:20,157
writing in the journaI,
and reading smaIIer and fatter books.

1008
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:23,494
Then I found out the Mayor's office
give me a Iiteracy award

1009
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,329
and a check for progress.

1010
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:29,500
One, two, three.

1011
01:16:29,585 --> 01:16:31,335
The party is on.

1012
01:16:31,628 --> 01:16:33,004
Go, Joann!

1013
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,384
Let me see what you got!

1014
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:43,556
Everybody come. Nurse John, Cornrows,
all the staff was out there.

1015
01:16:44,099 --> 01:16:46,350
Even Ms. Katherine showed up.

1016
01:16:46,685 --> 01:16:47,977
Precious.

1017
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:52,607
What's up?

1018
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:54,609
What's that?

1019
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:56,861
What does it look like?

1020
01:16:56,945 --> 01:16:58,863
Plastic stupid apple.

1021
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:03,701
A little something for you.

1022
01:17:03,785 --> 01:17:06,495
-ls there more money in it?
-You're so greedy.

1023
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:09,332
Yo, who's that?

1024
01:17:12,252 --> 01:17:13,502
What?

1025
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:18,382
-What?
-Come on.

1026
01:17:18,884 --> 01:17:21,344
Precious, where are you taking me?

1027
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:26,474
What am I supposed to do, diva? Yeah?
Wait a minute. Hold on, girl.

1028
01:17:26,558 --> 01:17:28,100
Yeah...

1029
01:17:32,272 --> 01:17:34,398
My mom called last night.

1030
01:17:37,069 --> 01:17:40,363
And we don't really have a relationship.

1031
01:17:40,822 --> 01:17:43,658
We don't talk,
because she really has a problem with...

1032
01:17:43,742 --> 01:17:47,495
Some folks got a light around them
that shine for other peopIes.

1033
01:17:47,579 --> 01:17:50,665
I think maybe some of them was in tunneIs,

1034
01:17:50,749 --> 01:17:53,459
and in that tunneI,
maybe the onIy Iight they had

1035
01:17:53,543 --> 01:17:55,086
was inside of them.

1036
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:58,422
Then I thought about how strong
you've had to be.

1037
01:18:01,009 --> 01:18:04,762
And then,
even Iong after they escaped that tunneI...

1038
01:18:06,098 --> 01:18:08,933
-l'll help you clean up.
-Okay.

1039
01:18:09,601 --> 01:18:12,603
...they stiII be shining for everybody eIse.

1040
01:18:16,817 --> 01:18:18,859
That's Ms. Rain to me.

1041
01:18:21,822 --> 01:18:23,364
"Award for Outstanding Achievement."

1042
01:18:23,448 --> 01:18:27,076
In a book I read,
this Iady escaped to a haIfway house.

1043
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:28,369
And when she was there,

1044
01:18:28,453 --> 01:18:31,372
she asked the peopIe there
what a haIfway house was.

1045
01:18:31,456 --> 01:18:35,793
They toId her it was haIfway between
her old life and where she wanna be.

1046
01:18:35,877 --> 01:18:37,795
That's kind of nice.

1047
01:18:39,464 --> 01:18:42,550
That aIso mean I can't stay here forever.

1048
01:18:42,634 --> 01:18:44,802
There's stiII a way to go.

1049
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:48,472
It'd be something to get my own apartment.

1050
01:18:49,307 --> 01:18:52,810
AbduI nine months and aImost waIking.
He's smart, too.

1051
01:18:53,478 --> 01:18:56,564
I've been reading to him
since the day he was born.

1052
01:18:56,648 --> 01:18:59,692
He's bareIy taIking,
but he's aIready counting.

1053
01:19:00,652 --> 01:19:02,486
Momma, Daddy,

1054
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:07,658
IS 1 1 1 , 444 Lenox aII seem
Iike some oId, bad dream.

1055
01:19:09,828 --> 01:19:13,831
I wish I couId've just started out here,
but still with Abdul.

1056
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:19,420
I'm gonna get Mongo, too.
I gotta get Mongo back.

1057
01:19:21,506 --> 01:19:22,590
Hey, Miss Cassidy.

1058
01:19:22,674 --> 01:19:24,884
Hey, Precious,
somebody downstairs for you.

1059
01:19:24,968 --> 01:19:26,719
-Who is it?
-l didn't ask who it was.

1060
01:19:26,803 --> 01:19:28,012
You want me to watch the baby?

1061
01:19:28,096 --> 01:19:30,973
No, I gotta go down and get him anyway.

1062
01:20:05,383 --> 01:20:07,051
Your daddy dead.

1063
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:10,429
That's all?

1064
01:20:15,519 --> 01:20:17,394
He had that AlDS virus.

1065
01:20:32,911 --> 01:20:34,161
There you go, dreaming again!

1066
01:20:34,246 --> 01:20:36,914
Precious, do you hear me taIking to you?

1067
01:20:38,333 --> 01:20:39,458
Did you hear what I said?

1068
01:20:44,422 --> 01:20:45,840
You got it?

1069
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:48,717
Got what?

1070
01:20:48,802 --> 01:20:50,761
-The AlDS virus.
-No.

1071
01:20:51,763 --> 01:20:53,430
How do you know?

1072
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:56,392
We never did it up in the ass, so I know.

1073
01:21:00,772 --> 01:21:03,232
You better get to a doctor, Mom.

1074
01:21:05,944 --> 01:21:07,653
You coming home?

1075
01:21:24,629 --> 01:21:26,130
Yo, Precious!

1076
01:21:44,774 --> 01:21:47,776
Rita, what do I mean when I say the author

1077
01:21:47,861 --> 01:21:52,531
describes her protagonist's circumstances
as "unrelenting"?

1078
01:21:53,533 --> 01:21:55,868
l don't know. I don't know.

1079
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:01,832
lt's like, say, like if Rita,
she tries to do something,

1080
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,376
and she's going and she's going,
and me, I try to stop her

1081
01:22:04,461 --> 01:22:07,087
and she no stop, she keep on going.

1082
01:22:07,714 --> 01:22:09,506
Relentless-un.

1083
01:23:02,227 --> 01:23:04,687
l'll see you tonight. Bye.

1084
01:23:53,778 --> 01:23:55,279
Come with me.

1085
01:23:56,698 --> 01:23:58,115
Precious?

1086
01:23:59,951 --> 01:24:01,410
Excuse me?

1087
01:24:03,329 --> 01:24:05,456
Nurse say l'm HlV positive.

1088
01:24:12,088 --> 01:24:14,631
l ain't got nothing to write today.

1089
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:18,135
ls your baby okay?

1090
01:24:19,179 --> 01:24:22,556
He all right.
l just got to stop breastfeeding him.

1091
01:24:26,269 --> 01:24:28,437
Remember, you once told me

1092
01:24:28,938 --> 01:24:31,815
you never really got to tell your story.

1093
01:24:33,276 --> 01:24:35,319
-Write.
-Fuck you!

1094
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:38,822
You know nothing
of what l've been through.

1095
01:24:39,991 --> 01:24:42,326
l ain't never had no boyfriend.

1096
01:24:44,996 --> 01:24:47,581
My daddy said he gonna marry me.

1097
01:24:48,249 --> 01:24:51,543
How he gonna do that?
lt would fucking be illegal!

1098
01:25:07,811 --> 01:25:09,019
Write.

1099
01:25:11,147 --> 01:25:13,690
l'm tired, Ms. Rain.

1100
01:25:14,567 --> 01:25:17,736
lf not for yourself,
then for the people who love you.

1101
01:25:17,821 --> 01:25:19,613
Nobody loves me.

1102
01:25:19,697 --> 01:25:21,949
People do love you, Precious.

1103
01:25:22,408 --> 01:25:24,868
Please don't lie to me, Ms. Rain.

1104
01:25:25,703 --> 01:25:28,080
Love ain't done nothing for me.

1105
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:32,543
Love beat me, raped me,

1106
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:37,965
called me an animal,
make me feel worthless.

1107
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:40,217
Make me sick.

1108
01:25:42,554 --> 01:25:44,638
That wasn't love, Precious.

1109
01:25:46,724 --> 01:25:48,559
Your baby loves you.

1110
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:53,313
l love you.

1111
01:26:00,613 --> 01:26:01,864
Write.

1112
01:26:10,790 --> 01:26:12,749
What are you thinking?

1113
01:26:14,919 --> 01:26:19,131
You never told me about
your relationship with your mother.

1114
01:26:21,885 --> 01:26:23,552
l didn't, did l?

1115
01:26:24,262 --> 01:26:26,847
Really, l'm here to help you.

1116
01:26:26,931 --> 01:26:30,100
You can talk to me.
This is a safe environment.

1117
01:26:31,436 --> 01:26:32,811
You're right.

1118
01:26:32,896 --> 01:26:35,439
We could talk about your daddy instead.

1119
01:26:35,523 --> 01:26:38,358
We could talk about my mother, my father,

1120
01:26:38,443 --> 01:26:42,821
my aunts or my sister or my brother,
but none of it's gonna help you.

1121
01:26:43,489 --> 01:26:44,990
You don't even like me.

1122
01:26:45,074 --> 01:26:48,118
Have we not been in this room together

1123
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:51,455
for, like, a year, discussing your life?

1124
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:54,541
Does that mean we like each other,
because we discuss my life?

1125
01:26:54,626 --> 01:26:56,084
l can't speak for you.

1126
01:26:56,169 --> 01:27:00,631
l can only speak for me,
and I do like you. I do.

1127
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:03,133
So, are you ltalian, or...

1128
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:04,509
What color are you, anyway?

1129
01:27:04,594 --> 01:27:06,678
Are you some type of black or Spanish?

1130
01:27:06,763 --> 01:27:08,972
What color do you think I am?

1131
01:27:10,934 --> 01:27:14,269
No, l'd like to know.
What color do you think I am?

1132
01:27:15,104 --> 01:27:16,813
My throat is dry.

1133
01:27:17,649 --> 01:27:19,399
Your throat is dry?

1134
01:27:19,817 --> 01:27:21,526
lt's really hot in here.

1135
01:27:21,611 --> 01:27:23,695
lt is kind of hot in here.

1136
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:27,115
l'm gonna go get a soda.
What do you want?

1137
01:27:27,492 --> 01:27:29,326
Soda sounds fine.

1138
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:30,827
All right.

1139
01:28:01,359 --> 01:28:02,859
Thank you.

1140
01:28:03,444 --> 01:28:04,903
No problem.

1141
01:28:08,616 --> 01:28:11,827
So, I have to talk to you about your mother,

1142
01:28:12,370 --> 01:28:14,705
and I don't know
how you're gonna feel about this,

1143
01:28:14,789 --> 01:28:17,541
but she says she wants to see you

1144
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:22,254
and she wants to be reunited
with you and her grandchildren.

1145
01:28:22,839 --> 01:28:25,799
She wants to come
and have a session here with you.

1146
01:28:25,883 --> 01:28:27,467
What did you tell her?

1147
01:28:27,552 --> 01:28:30,387
l said I had to speak to you about it.

1148
01:28:33,016 --> 01:28:34,433
lt's up to you.

1149
01:28:34,517 --> 01:28:37,477
l don't know.
l never thought about it before.

1150
01:28:39,022 --> 01:28:41,523
Ms. Weiss said in that fiIe I got HIV.

1151
01:28:41,607 --> 01:28:44,026
She said I was supposed to die from it.

1152
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:46,153
I ain't worried about dying.

1153
01:28:46,237 --> 01:28:50,198
Shit, I gotta worry about
how I'm supposed to raise these kids.

1154
01:28:51,200 --> 01:28:53,702
l was just writing, like, about...

1155
01:28:54,412 --> 01:28:56,496
l wanna open up this clinic

1156
01:28:56,581 --> 01:28:59,791
about, like, mothers and their children.

1157
01:29:00,626 --> 01:29:03,670
You know, just,
if they're sick or something like that.

1158
01:29:03,755 --> 01:29:07,424
l always wanted to do that,
give back to the community.

1159
01:29:07,508 --> 01:29:10,385
Because I know my mom would be
proud of me if I did that,

1160
01:29:10,470 --> 01:29:12,137
and my children, too.

1161
01:29:12,221 --> 01:29:15,932
l want my children to be proud
of their mother, you know?

1162
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:21,605
-That's always what I wanted to do, so...
-That's good. That's really nice.

1163
01:29:25,193 --> 01:29:29,654
l don't really want to read the whole thing,
l kind ofjust wanna say what it's about.

1164
01:29:30,907 --> 01:29:34,534
Okay, the counselors
at Advancement House,

1165
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:38,872
they were quizzing me
about my mother and my father, right?

1166
01:29:38,956 --> 01:29:40,707
But it's not really about them.

1167
01:29:40,792 --> 01:29:42,876
They're trying to get me to do workfare.

1168
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,337
-They want me to be a home attendant.
-How do you know?

1169
01:29:45,421 --> 01:29:47,714
Because I stole my file and I read it.

1170
01:29:47,799 --> 01:29:49,716
All they want me to do is work.

1171
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:53,053
Now, I do wanna work,
but not for no welfare check.

1172
01:29:53,137 --> 01:29:54,554
What kind of sense that make,

1173
01:29:54,639 --> 01:29:57,557
for somebody like Precious to quit school
before she got her GED

1174
01:29:57,642 --> 01:30:00,268
and go work
for some old white people somewhere?

1175
01:30:00,353 --> 01:30:03,438
She ain't never gonna be nothing
if she gets stuck in some shit like that.

1176
01:30:03,523 --> 01:30:05,023
Rhonda used to home attend.

1177
01:30:05,108 --> 01:30:08,110
She used to have to go all the way out
to Brighton Beach.

1178
01:30:08,194 --> 01:30:11,530
Yeah, okay, Rhonda would be
working there all day and night.

1179
01:30:11,614 --> 01:30:13,657
She'd be on call, right?

1180
01:30:14,075 --> 01:30:18,286
She made $6.37 an hour,
but for only eight hours.

1181
01:30:18,871 --> 01:30:20,997
That equal out to $50.96.

1182
01:30:21,999 --> 01:30:23,417
But that's not a whole lot of money,

1183
01:30:23,501 --> 01:30:26,628
especially 'cause,
for real, she there for 24 hours.

1184
01:30:26,712 --> 01:30:31,425
So, $50.96 divided by 24

1185
01:30:31,509 --> 01:30:35,429
is $2.1 2 an hour. That's not a lot of money.

1186
01:30:35,513 --> 01:30:39,891
She said that old bitch would ring a bell,
like, a real-life, actual bell

1187
01:30:39,976 --> 01:30:41,810
when she wanted something from her
in the middle of the night.

1188
01:30:41,894 --> 01:30:44,604
-You don't want to do that shit.
-Rhonda, is that true? Rhonda!

1189
01:30:44,689 --> 01:30:47,732
Them home attendants be working for, like,
six days a week.

1190
01:30:47,817 --> 01:30:51,695
l'd only see Abdul on Sunday.
Plus, l'd have to leave class.

1191
01:30:52,029 --> 01:30:55,323
Well, that's not an option.
You're not leaving class.

1192
01:30:55,408 --> 01:30:58,535
Plus, l'm gonna start going to
insect survivor meetings.

1193
01:30:58,619 --> 01:31:00,120
lt's "incest."

1194
01:31:01,873 --> 01:31:05,041
-That ain't what I said?
-No, you said "insect."

1195
01:31:05,626 --> 01:31:06,918
What's the difference?

1196
01:31:07,003 --> 01:31:08,795
Well, one's where your family molests you,

1197
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,548
the other's like a roach or bugs.

1198
01:31:14,218 --> 01:31:16,845
-So, you a scientist now?
-l'm just saying.

1199
01:31:16,929 --> 01:31:19,723
No, that's cool. Thank you. Thank you.

1200
01:31:25,897 --> 01:31:29,483
It was hard teIIing them strangers there
what my father did.

1201
01:31:29,567 --> 01:31:31,568
Sometimes it felt good.

1202
01:31:36,824 --> 01:31:41,036
Last week, Ms. Rain asked us
to write down what we wanna be like.

1203
01:31:41,454 --> 01:31:44,998
I wrote that I be reaI skinny,

1204
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:47,959
with Iight skin and Iong hair.

1205
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:51,087
Loretha Holloway?

1206
01:31:52,298 --> 01:31:53,423
Go on back there.

1207
01:31:53,508 --> 01:31:55,342
She read it and said l'm beautiful like I am.

1208
01:31:55,426 --> 01:31:58,929
But, there's no kids back there
for me to play with.

1209
01:32:01,098 --> 01:32:03,058
Just shut up and sit there, then.

1210
01:32:03,142 --> 01:32:06,520
Gonna talk to this lady
before my shit gets cut off.

1211
01:32:06,604 --> 01:32:08,063
But somehow,

1212
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:12,442
right now... And I don't know why, but...

1213
01:32:14,570 --> 01:32:16,321
I think she right.

1214
01:32:22,703 --> 01:32:23,787
Here.

1215
01:32:32,463 --> 01:32:34,089
Clareece Jones?

1216
01:32:40,054 --> 01:32:42,055
I think she right.

1217
01:32:47,311 --> 01:32:49,396
Okay, Mrs. Johnston,
let's talk about the abuse.

1218
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:51,690
There were no drugs in my house.

1219
01:32:51,774 --> 01:32:53,733
l didn't play that.
There weren't no drugs in my house.

1220
01:32:53,818 --> 01:32:55,485
Precious knew I would whup her ass

1221
01:32:55,570 --> 01:32:57,070
if she gonna bring some drugs
up in my house.

1222
01:32:57,154 --> 01:32:59,531
You know what l'm talking about.

1223
01:33:00,658 --> 01:33:05,829
l'm referring to specific
sexual and physical acts

1224
01:33:06,372 --> 01:33:08,164
involving Precious.

1225
01:33:08,833 --> 01:33:10,834
Why you ain't say that?

1226
01:33:11,544 --> 01:33:13,169
Yes, that.

1227
01:33:15,214 --> 01:33:17,132
What do you wanna know?

1228
01:33:17,216 --> 01:33:19,217
According to Precious' files,

1229
01:33:19,302 --> 01:33:23,346
she has now had two children
by your boyfriend,

1230
01:33:23,431 --> 01:33:27,684
the late Carl Kenwood Jones,
who was also her father.

1231
01:33:33,983 --> 01:33:35,984
-Yeah.
-This is accurate?

1232
01:33:38,404 --> 01:33:40,196
Yes, Ms. Weiss.

1233
01:33:40,698 --> 01:33:43,783
l need to know why you're here.
You've been calling this office

1234
01:33:43,868 --> 01:33:47,787
saying you want to be reunited
with Precious and your grandchild.

1235
01:33:47,872 --> 01:33:51,374
Now, I really need to know
what's gone on in that home.

1236
01:33:51,459 --> 01:33:53,585
Ms. Weiss,
l understand we need to discuss it,

1237
01:33:53,669 --> 01:33:55,003
but l'm just telling you.

1238
01:33:55,087 --> 01:33:57,839
You said l've been calling here
and l've been wanting to see

1239
01:33:57,923 --> 01:33:59,382
Precious and my grandson.

1240
01:33:59,467 --> 01:34:03,970
You're goddamn right I wanna see them.
Because they belong to me. Okay?

1241
01:34:04,055 --> 01:34:07,098
Now, there was a time
Precious had everything,

1242
01:34:07,183 --> 01:34:08,975
and I done told her that.

1243
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:12,687
And me and Carl, we loved Precious.
And you need to know that.

1244
01:34:12,772 --> 01:34:15,482
We loved Precious and we had dreams.

1245
01:34:15,566 --> 01:34:20,278
Precious was born around the same time
Ms. West's son got killed.

1246
01:34:21,781 --> 01:34:25,742
The summertime.
She was born in the summertime.

1247
01:34:25,826 --> 01:34:27,827
Remember? Remember that?

1248
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:30,080
l was born in November.

1249
01:34:30,581 --> 01:34:32,123
November.

1250
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,460
Yeah, that's right.

1251
01:34:36,754 --> 01:34:38,630
My Scorpio child.

1252
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,258
You know...

1253
01:34:42,968 --> 01:34:47,013
Scorpios, they can be tricky.

1254
01:34:48,224 --> 01:34:52,769
And, l'm not saying that they lie.
l'm not saying that.

1255
01:34:53,312 --> 01:34:55,647
But you just gotta watch them.

1256
01:34:59,610 --> 01:35:03,405
Can we talk about the actual acts

1257
01:35:03,489 --> 01:35:06,199
of physical and sexual abuse

1258
01:35:06,283 --> 01:35:08,743
that occurred in your household?

1259
01:35:09,328 --> 01:35:10,870
When it first began,

1260
01:35:10,955 --> 01:35:13,957
where it happened
and how did you respond?

1261
01:35:20,339 --> 01:35:22,507
Precious was a little girl.

1262
01:35:23,968 --> 01:35:26,970
Try and remember
how old you think she was.

1263
01:35:31,267 --> 01:35:32,809
She was three.

1264
01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:38,231
And I had been giving her the bottle

1265
01:35:40,151 --> 01:35:42,610
and I was giving Carl the tittie

1266
01:35:42,987 --> 01:35:47,031
because my milk hadn't dried up
in my breasts

1267
01:35:48,159 --> 01:35:51,494
but not from her, but because Carl was...

1268
01:35:52,663 --> 01:35:54,581
Because Carl was sucking on them

1269
01:35:54,665 --> 01:35:58,501
and that's what kept my milk in my breasts.

1270
01:36:01,213 --> 01:36:04,007
And I thought that that was for hygiene.

1271
01:36:04,925 --> 01:36:07,677
l did what my mother told me

1272
01:36:08,262 --> 01:36:12,140
that I was supposed to do with my child,
so that's what I did.

1273
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:15,268
And you're sitting up there
and you're trying to judge me...

1274
01:36:15,352 --> 01:36:18,188
l'm not judging you,
but you're asking me for money

1275
01:36:18,272 --> 01:36:20,690
and you're asking me
to be reunited with your grandson.

1276
01:36:20,775 --> 01:36:23,193
But, Ms. Weiss,
l don't like you looking at me like that.

1277
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:26,821
You got this bitch looking at me
like l'm some kind of fucking monster.

1278
01:36:26,906 --> 01:36:28,823
We don't talk like this in my office, okay?

1279
01:36:28,908 --> 01:36:32,452
l didn't want her sucking behind him,
because that was nasty.

1280
01:36:32,536 --> 01:36:36,247
And things that he was...
lt was just nasty, Ms. Weiss.

1281
01:36:41,879 --> 01:36:45,507
l had a man, and I have a child

1282
01:36:47,301 --> 01:36:51,137
and I had to take care of both of them.
Okay?

1283
01:36:52,807 --> 01:36:57,811
Did I want Carl to touch my baby?

1284
01:36:59,897 --> 01:37:02,232
Because I would lay my baby.

1285
01:37:02,316 --> 01:37:06,945
l would lay her on the side of me,
on this pillow

1286
01:37:08,697 --> 01:37:10,865
and it was pink

1287
01:37:11,575 --> 01:37:14,619
and it had this little white writing on it

1288
01:37:14,703 --> 01:37:18,832
and it had her name,
because she was precious.

1289
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:22,085
And I would lay my baby on that pillow

1290
01:37:22,169 --> 01:37:25,547
and Carl would be laying on the other side

1291
01:37:26,966 --> 01:37:30,844
and then we would...
We would start doing it

1292
01:37:30,928 --> 01:37:33,054
and he reached over

1293
01:37:35,349 --> 01:37:37,350
and he touched my baby.

1294
01:37:37,434 --> 01:37:38,977
And I asked him,

1295
01:37:39,770 --> 01:37:42,355
l said, "Carl, what are you doing?"

1296
01:37:42,439 --> 01:37:44,858
And he told me to shut...

1297
01:37:44,942 --> 01:37:47,944
To shut my fat ass up,
and it was good for her.

1298
01:37:48,028 --> 01:37:51,281
-And what did you do then?
-l shut my fat ass up.

1299
01:37:51,782 --> 01:37:55,118
And I don't want you to sit there
and judge me, Ms. Weiss.

1300
01:37:55,202 --> 01:37:56,953
You shut up
and you let him abuse your daughter?

1301
01:37:57,037 --> 01:37:58,997
l did not want him to abuse my daughter.

1302
01:37:59,123 --> 01:38:00,582
-l did not want him to hurt her.
-But you allowed him

1303
01:38:00,666 --> 01:38:02,542
-to hurt her.
-l did not want him to do nothing to her.

1304
01:38:02,626 --> 01:38:04,544
l wanted him to make love to me.

1305
01:38:04,628 --> 01:38:07,630
That was my man.
That was my fucking man.

1306
01:38:07,798 --> 01:38:10,633
That was my man
and he wanted my daughter.

1307
01:38:11,927 --> 01:38:14,220
And that's why I hated her.

1308
01:38:14,305 --> 01:38:17,307
Because my man,
who was supposed to be loving me,

1309
01:38:17,391 --> 01:38:20,226
who was supposed
to be making love to me,

1310
01:38:21,312 --> 01:38:23,563
was fucking my baby.

1311
01:38:23,647 --> 01:38:27,275
She made him leave.
She made him go away.

1312
01:38:27,818 --> 01:38:28,943
So, whose fault was it, then?

1313
01:38:29,028 --> 01:38:32,196
lt's this bitch's fault
because she let my man have her

1314
01:38:32,281 --> 01:38:33,865
and she didn't say nothing.

1315
01:38:33,949 --> 01:38:35,950
She didn't scream. She didn't do nothing.

1316
01:38:36,035 --> 01:38:39,579
So, those things she told you I did to her,

1317
01:38:39,663 --> 01:38:42,832
who else was gonna love me?

1318
01:38:45,836 --> 01:38:49,464
Since you got your degree
and you know every-fucking-thing,

1319
01:38:49,548 --> 01:38:53,593
who was gonna love me,
who was gonna make me feel good?

1320
01:38:53,677 --> 01:38:57,347
Who was gonna touch me
and make me feel good late at night?

1321
01:38:57,431 --> 01:38:59,974
And she made him go away, so...

1322
01:39:00,726 --> 01:39:04,228
When you sit there and you write
them fucking notes on your pad

1323
01:39:04,313 --> 01:39:08,358
about who you think I am,
and why I did it, all of that.

1324
01:39:09,693 --> 01:39:11,903
Because I didn't have nobody.

1325
01:39:20,704 --> 01:39:23,873
The people from

1326
01:39:25,501 --> 01:39:27,543
Each One Teach One,

1327
01:39:28,253 --> 01:39:31,214
they had... They called me

1328
01:39:34,176 --> 01:39:37,261
and they told me that my baby
was writing poems.

1329
01:39:37,346 --> 01:39:38,846
ln fact, you know what, I got...

1330
01:39:38,931 --> 01:39:40,515
Wait a minute.

1331
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:07,959
l'm sorry.

1332
01:40:08,961 --> 01:40:12,338
l'm sorry.
And, Ms. Weiss, I don't want no checks.

1333
01:40:12,423 --> 01:40:16,634
l don't need no more money. Please.
l'm so sorry.

1334
01:40:17,553 --> 01:40:19,721
l took that TABE test again.

1335
01:40:20,931 --> 01:40:22,056
And what happened?

1336
01:40:22,141 --> 01:40:23,808
l scored a 7.8.

1337
01:40:25,519 --> 01:40:27,437
Last time it was 2.8.

1338
01:40:29,815 --> 01:40:31,190
According to that test,

1339
01:40:31,275 --> 01:40:33,985
l'm reading at
a seventh- and eighth-grade level.

1340
01:40:35,279 --> 01:40:38,448
Next year, high school. After that, college.

1341
01:40:44,997 --> 01:40:46,789
Well, I like you, too.

1342
01:40:49,126 --> 01:40:51,169
But you can't handle me.

1343
01:40:52,963 --> 01:40:55,298
You can't handle none of this.

1344
01:41:03,223 --> 01:41:06,642
You know, I never knew what you was
until this day.

1345
01:41:06,727 --> 01:41:09,479
Not even after all them things you did.

1346
01:41:10,981 --> 01:41:14,484
Maybe I was too stupid, or
maybe I just didn't want to.

1347
01:41:16,945 --> 01:41:19,280
You ain't gonna see me no more.

1348
01:41:22,868 --> 01:41:24,160
Bye!

1349
01:41:27,873 --> 01:41:29,749
l didn't want him to hurt my baby.

1350
01:41:29,833 --> 01:41:32,251
Please, God,
l didn't want him to hurt my baby.

1351
01:41:32,336 --> 01:41:35,213
Ms. Weiss,
l didn't want him to hurt my baby.

1352
01:41:35,297 --> 01:41:37,090
l would say to him, I would say...

1353
01:41:37,174 --> 01:41:40,426
"Carl, what are you doing?
What are you doing? What are you doing?"
