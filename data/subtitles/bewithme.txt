One oyster omelet.
What a beautiful sunset!
Certainly.
I can't seem to recall
the last time I felt this peaceful.
You're right.
We've come so far.
Without you
I wouldn't be where I am now.
Where is fate leading us?
We will go wherever
it takes us.
We'll always be together,
till the end, right?
How much is this?
You tell them
it's too expensive.
You're asleep again.
Don't come back tomorrow.
You're fired.
Damn!
Crying day and night.
What are you doing, fatty?
- Hello.
- Hello.
I am...
your new teacher.
My name is Ms. Chan.
What is your name?
My name is Shijia.
You look...
very cute.
Thank you.
Candy?
Thank you.
Hey!
Get me a beer.
Where's mine?
I beat him all the time
when he was young,
and he still turned out useless.
Why isn't he like you?
Sir, please buy some tissue.
$1 for three packets.
Thank you, thank you.
Hello?
Why have you been
avoiding me?
StarHub is unable

Please try again later.
Get out!
Can I help you?
Are you okay?
...may perish from all sorts of hurt.
Love disappears only when you
do not understand what it means.
I was born July 9, 1943,
in Sago Lane.
I was a cute and happy baby.
But had my parents known
what was in store for me,
they would probably
have given me away for adoption.
Dad lost a thriving
restaurant business.
I had to learn how to cook, wash
and clean by the time I was 10.
My parents were happy
and proud of me.
But their happiness and pride
did not last long.
There was little knowledge
as to what
really happened
to cause my deafness.
How much is this?
This one can.
How is your father?
He is fine.
Do you go to see him?
Yes, sometimes.
You should see him more often.
Old man. Old man.
A pack of Marlboro.
Marlboro.
Why run a business
behind a closed grill?
It's so inconvenient.
You should open the grill.
At 14, I went deaf.
Why, I don't know.
One night blood and pus
trickled down my cheek.
Both my mother and father
didn't think much of it.
My mother thought
it was only a small boil
which had burst open.
The next morning
I lost my hearing.
She shouted into my ears,
but I couldn't make out
what she was saying.
How much pain and suffering
can a person take?
I have often wrestled
with that question.
I've lost my hearing, and now
I'm about to lose my sight as well.
It all started with the right eye.
I saw changing colors
and black dots
and I kept blinking.
My parents did not
take me immediately
to the hospital for treatment.
They just gave me eye drops
and Chinese herbs.
They only sought help
when I was no longer able
to see with my right eye
and when my left eye
started to give me trouble.
I remember long stays
in the hospital,
daily vision tests,
painful injections
and bandages on my eyes.
My hands were tied at night
because they didn't want me
to touch my bandages.
Every morning
when the doctors
came to check on me,
I asked them
if I would ever see again.
One doctor patted my hand
without replying to my question.
I just kept praying-
"I do not want to be blind,
and I do not deserve
this eternal punishment. "
I became blind.
I felt I was living
in a silent and dark prison.
There were days
when I didn't want to live.
But there were good days
when I would tell myself
that it did not matter
as long as I was alive
and I was guarded by heaven's love.
I doubt if most people
can understand
what it's like to be deaf and blind.
It's as if someone had a wall
which nobody can tear
or break down.
I cannot see beautiful sights
or hear beautiful sounds.
But I never saw or heard
anything ugly either.
God works in mysterious ways.
Sometimes people appear
and just change
the course of your life.
Mrs. Elizabeth Choy
came into my life
and it suddenly veered
into the most wondrous
of dimensions.
Beth, now 95,
is a remarkable person.
She suffered during World War ll,
but she never lost
her self-respect,
her dignity
and her love for humanity.
She is my personal heroine of peace.
It was because of her
that I went to school.
At that time,
Beth was the principal
of the School for the Blind.
Alerted by a social worker,
Beth came to my home in 1957
and won me over.
Somehow in my heart I knew
she was kind
and could be trusted.
She enrolled me
in the School for the Blind.
It never crossed my mind
that I could attend school again
after becoming deaf and blind.
I soon met Reuben Jacob
who became my beloved teacher.
Singapore School
for the Visually Handicapped
Nobody expected much
from Mr. Jacob
as far as educating me
was concerned.
After all,
I had a double handicap
and I spoke Cantonese
and no English.
He was blind, Jewish
and spoke no Chinese.
But my teacher was
a smart and patient man.
He devised his own methods
of teaching someone
who was not only blind
but deaf too.
Would you like me
to teach you weaving?
Yes.
Okay. Please do it for me.
Up and down.
Up and down.
Up and
down.
Okay. Please do.
The paper is
like your finger.
You must be careful.
Do not bend it, okay?
In early 1957, Sir John Wilson,
the blind director
of the Royal Commonwealth Society
for the Blind in London,
toured South-East Asia.
The visit was to mark
another milestone in my life.
When he visited the school,
Beth told me to tell him in Cantonese,
"Please help me and remember me.
I want to go to school. "
Mr. Wilson did.
He visited the famous
Perkins school
in Massachusetts
and told the director,
Dr. Edward Waterhouse,
about a deaf and blind girl
in Singapore-
"If you see her, you will like her. "
Well, Dr. Waterhouse turned up
in Singapore in 1958.
Yes, he liked me.
In fact, he liked me so much
he offered me a scholarship
to go to Perkins,
where they had the best teachers
and facilities to educate
someone like me.
And so I found myself in America
at the end of 1960.
I could not speak English
at that time,
and one of the most
important things
was teaching me speech.
It was probably baffling
to a lot of people
how someone like me
who is both blind and deaf
can learn a totally new language.
I guess it's true what they say-
"If there's a will, there's a way. "
Determination can conquer
the most difficult
and discouraging things
in the world.
...I prayed all the time-
"Please don't make me blind. "
"I don't deserve
this eternal punishment. "
The Story of Precious Lotus
Pa.
Pa, how are you?
Pa, your food is the best!
Pa.
Eat.
Ma's dead.
You have to
take care of yourself.
I'm translating a book
for this lady, Theresa.
She's deaf and blind.
This is her life story.
You should read it.
I have to go
and see Theresa now.
I'll come back
next Sunday for dinner.
My father cooked this.
I thought you might like it-
braised pork.
Smells delicious.
I was blessed and lucky enough
to have traveled the world.
It was in Bombay that I encountered
my first sorrowful experience.
One night
God wanted me to know His world.
My traveling companion
Peggy and I
were standing
on the balcony of the hotel
when she described
what she saw to me.
On the dirty pavements
were hordes of homeless
families sleeping.
Peggy said they looked
hungry and lifeless.
It struck me then
that while I was disabled,
I had everything.
These people were just struggling
so that they could survive.
I quietly made a vow that one day
I would donate something
to these poor people in India.
In 1975, I appealed
to the public for help
and received some money
with which I bought
two Perkins Braille writers
and two Braille watches.
I arranged for these
and a sum of money
to be sent to India.
I did a lot of growing up
in America.
I received an education,
I did things
I never thought I could do.
I even dated.
Pa.
Theresa loves your cooking.
I love curry.
It tastes good.
Anything special you would like
my father to cook?
My father is very inspired
by your book.
This tastes very nice.
Your father is a good cook.
My father is very happy
cooking for you.
He really enjoys your feedback.
I have three regular visits a week
from kind folks
who come to help me
with my weekly grocery shopping,
to take me out
or to keep me company.
My father is getting better.
...From one who loves you...
Going down.
Going up.
Going up.
We all have dreams.
I am no different.
I dreamed of being
a Chinese opera singer
at age three,
but fate robbed me
of this dream.
Are there dreams
that do not die?
God alone knows,
and I trust Him.
I nearly got married in 1968,
but I lost him to nose cancer
on Christmas Day, 1968.
Till today,
at five to 5:00
every Christmas morning,
my tears flow freely.
Today I am still single
and still very much
in love with him.
I dreamed of love and family
but God took my only love
and all my sweet dreams died.
Pa, I need your help.
I have to attend
to a suicide case now.
I need you to visit Theresa.
She's expecting me at 8:00 p. m.
Can you please go first?
I can't make it on time.
I don't want her to worry.
Smells good.
What did your father
cook today?
Who are you?
Are you his father?
Yes.
Come in.
