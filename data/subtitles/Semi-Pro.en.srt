00:00:01,835 --> 00:00:05,922
# Baby, who wants to love me sexy? #

2
00:00:06,006 --> 00:00:07,215
# Ooh #

3
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:10,760
# Baby, who's ready to lick me sexy? #

4
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:12,846
# Uhh uhh #

00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:18,101
# Baby, we're naked
and we're humpin' sexy #

6
00:00:18,184 --> 00:00:21,062
# Love me sexy! #

7
00:00:27,944 --> 00:00:30,655
# Come on girl, yeah #

8
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,324
# It's me, Jackie Moon #

9
00:00:33,408 --> 00:00:36,161
# Give me that look, that's right #

10
00:00:36,244 --> 00:00:39,414
# Let's get sweaty,
let's get real sweaty #

11
00:00:39,497 --> 00:00:42,292
# I'm talkin' rainforest sweaty #

12
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:45,211
# I'm talkin' swamp sweaty #

13
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:50,008
# Let's fill the bathtub full of sweat
all right #

14
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:55,805
# Baby, who wants to love me sexy?
Uhh! #

15
00:00:55,889 --> 00:01:01,227
# Baby, are you ready to lick me sexy?
Uh! Uh! #

16
00:01:02,729 --> 00:01:05,356
# Baby, wake up we're naked #

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,818
# And we're humpin' sexy #

18
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:10,153
# Come on girl #

19
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:14,908
# Baby, who wants to love me sexy?
Uhh! #

20
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:16,159
# Love me sexy #

21
00:01:16,242 --> 00:01:19,662
# Baby, are you ready to lick me sexy? #

22
00:01:19,746 --> 00:01:21,831
- # Uh! Uh! #
- # Lick me sexy #

23
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:24,834
# Take off your shoes
and suck me sexy #

24
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:27,545
# Suck suck
suck, suck, suck me sexy #

25
00:01:27,629 --> 00:01:31,341
# Baby, we're naked
and we're humpin' sexy #

26
00:01:31,424 --> 00:01:33,676
- # Whoo! #
- # Sexy #

27
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,346
# I wanna do a little thing wit' you #

28
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:39,182
# I wanna do a little thing
wit' you #

29
00:01:39,265 --> 00:01:42,102
# When I say "love me"
you say "sexy" #

30
00:01:42,185 --> 00:01:43,686
# Love me #

31
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:47,232
- Sexy.
- Oh yeah Flint Tropics crowd!

32
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:50,944
Get it goin'. It feels good doesn't it?

33
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,238
I see some ladies up there
who wanna love me sexy.

34
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:56,199
Jackie Moon soaking up
a robust round of applause...

35
00:01:56,282 --> 00:02:00,495
as he finishes up his
once-popular song Love Me Sexy.

36
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:02,372
I'm Dick Pepperfield, joined
as always...

37
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:05,208
by former Tropics forward
Lou Redwood.

38
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,335
Yeah I might suit up tonight.

39
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:09,712
Sometimes I still dream of glory Dick.

40
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,174
Well, sometimes dreams
can turn into nightmares, Lou.

41
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,260
What's your problem?

42
00:02:15,343 --> 00:02:17,470
And now the starting lineup...

43
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:22,350
...for your Flint Michigan Tropics!

44
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:28,231
At Ball Girl measuring 34-23-34...

45
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:30,066
she hopes to be
an astronaut one day...

46
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,901
I don't think she can do it.

47
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:36,573
Put your hands together for Melinda!

48
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,117
Go Tropics!

49
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,577
From South Bend Indiana...

50
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,372
this guy has a heart of gold
his brother's a retard.

51
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:47,584
He reads to him
and paints him pretty pictures...

52
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,420
Scootsie Doubleday!

53
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,714
Scootsie Doubleday
taking the court now.

54
00:02:52,797 --> 00:02:54,591
Yeah his brother
is really retarded.

55
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:55,592
Ronnie Doubleday.

56
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,469
He has all three
major kinds of retardation.

57
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:02,223
This guy is single and
disease-free no V.D. at all...

58
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:05,268
but you could be the lucky girl
to give it to him!

59
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,728
Six foot five!

60
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,189
Twiggy Munson!

61
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:10,440
Of course he's disease-free.

62
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:12,275
What chick wants to be with a guy
that's hung like a twig?

63
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,194
Well that's not true.
I've heard a lot of women say...

64
00:03:14,277 --> 00:03:15,612
that they actually prefer a small penis.

65
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:18,323
Show me one gal who says that
and I'll show you a liar.

66
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,867
I'll introduce you to
Mrs. Pepperfield later on tonight.

67
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,160
Oh Jesus here we go.

68
00:03:22,243 --> 00:03:23,411
Your man in the middle...

69
00:03:23,494 --> 00:03:24,704
seven foot two...

70
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:27,624
from a weird country called Lithuania.

71
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,792
He's ugly as shit.

72
00:03:29,876 --> 00:03:34,631
- Vakidis!
- Go daddy!

73
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:35,882
- This fella scares me.
- Yeah!

74
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:38,426
That little kid from the Jackson Five
he scares ya too.

75
00:03:38,509 --> 00:03:39,928
Oh mark my words Lou...

76
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:42,138
there's something creepy
about that young man.

77
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,806
Bobby Dee where's Clarence?

78
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,475
- Nobody's heard from him.
- Come on Tropics!

79
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,851
Bee Bee!

80
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,186
You're startin'.

81
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:50,480
From Peoria Illinois...

82
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,940
this guy
what can I say about him?

83
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,984
He's got the hottest girl in the world
I'm not kiddin'.

84
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:58,029
Cannons people. Big ol' boobies.

85
00:03:58,112 --> 00:04:03,952
The luckiest man in Flint--
Bee Bee Ellis!

86
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,745
Well, it's true about
what they say about Bee Bee's wife.

87
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,914
She has got a tremendous set of boobs.

88
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,374
To me they're too large.

89
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:10,875
Oh they're perfect.

90
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,379
I don't know they--To me
she looks structurally unsound.

91
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,548
And now the moment
you've all been waiting for.

92
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:22,220
At six foot five
a solid meaty 215 pounds...

93
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:25,515
your pregame announcer,
your owner, your coach...

94
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,643
your pop-singing sensation,
but most importantly...

95
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:30,019
your power forward...

96
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:36,025
yours truly, Jackie Moon!

97
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:37,360
All right!

98
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:39,237
Jackie Moon
always gives himself...

99
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,239
a fantastic introduction.

100
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,573
- Yeah, why not, Dick?
- Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

101
00:04:42,657 --> 00:04:45,702
It's his team, his money and
his tunnel of beautiful ball girls.

102
00:04:45,785 --> 00:04:48,788
Oh speaking of money Lou
did you get paid this week?

103
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:49,831
No.

104
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,541
You lose weight Father Pat?

105
00:04:51,624 --> 00:04:52,583
Fuck off Jackie.

106
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:56,504
All right guys huddle up.
Vakidis!

107
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,673
What is he doin'?
You know what? Fuck it.

108
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:01,134
Listen I promised these fans
a show tonight all right?

109
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,720
Twiggy, if you get a dunk tonight
try to break that backboard all right?

110
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:05,388
- We'll get that on the news.
- All right.

111
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,724
Let's bring it in,
it's showtime right? Let's get...

112
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,309
Tropical!

113
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,853
Go Tropics!

114
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,230
Right here right here right here!

115
00:05:14,314 --> 00:05:16,024
I don't like it.

116
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,317
Back! Back!

117
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,777
Clear!
Yep that feels good. That feels--

118
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:22,655
- Danny what are ya doin'?
- Nothin'. Eatin' nachos.

119
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:24,073
You get 'em from the concession stand?

120
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,743
- Nah I brought 'em from home.
- What? Uh-uh.

121
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:28,286
No no no no no.

122
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:29,746
Oh come on!

123
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:30,955
- What?
- Travel!

124
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,124
He brought nachos from home.
Tryin' to run a business here.

125
00:05:33,207 --> 00:05:35,084
- You can't call that.
- Jackie you gotta dribble...

126
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,085
if you're gonna move.

127
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:37,420
What are you talkin' about?

128
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:39,297
- Basketball rules.
- Fine.

129
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,758
I got season tickets.
I can do whatever the hell I want.

130
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,509
Oh yeah?
Well I can do this.

131
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:45,762
And this.

132
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:49,015
And that!

133
00:05:49,098 --> 00:05:50,683
Let's go Trops!

134
00:05:51,893 --> 00:05:54,354
We are well underway
and the big question Lou--

135
00:05:54,437 --> 00:05:58,107
where is Tropics' leading scorer
Clarence "Downtown" Malone?

136
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,318
I agree it's completely
unprofessional, Dick.

137
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,320
Lou, can I ask you
to please put out your cigarette?

138
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,489
No I like to smoke when I drink.

139
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:07,367
Hey so don't get all lonely
on me now, people.

140
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,744
Come on down to Pet Galaxy.

141
00:06:09,827 --> 00:06:10,953
Whoo!

142
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,706
So you make sure you tell 'em...

143
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,792
Sweet Sugar Dunkerton sent ya.

144
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,585
Hey! I'm open.

145
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:18,961
Whoo!

146
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,967
Gentlemen what can I get for you?

147
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,803
Hey wasn't that just you?

148
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,429
- There on TV?
- You like that don't you?

149
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,472
That's cool huh?

150
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,433
Hey the TV say your name was
Sugar Dunkinton.

151
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,811
How come your nametag don't say that?

152
00:06:34,894 --> 00:06:36,312
'Cause I changed it.

153
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:40,483
"Downtown Funky Stuff" Malone.

154
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:43,778
- Clarence!
- "Downtown".

155
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:46,531
I ain't never named
no son of mine no "Downtown".

156
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:48,908
Well you know what?
I can't hear a damn thing you sayin'.

157
00:06:48,991 --> 00:06:51,369
Mm-hm. Every hear of a clock? It's 7:15.

158
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:52,620
Shit!

159
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,469
OK Tropics fans
it's time to guess today's attendance.

160
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:12,014
Is it A, 7254...

161
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,767
- B, 8,506--
- Go inside!

162
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,437
...or C, 91 ?

163
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,896
Oh!

164
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:21,816
Look at that an easy lay-up there
for the Nets. That's two points.

165
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:24,318
I'm thinking of getting
one of these Jap cars like a Datsun.

166
00:07:24,402 --> 00:07:27,280
Yeah. Put away the classifieds
please, Lou, and let's focus.

167
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:34,036
All right, fans, let's hear it for
"Downtown Funky Stuff" Malone!

168
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,580
Father Pat that guy's gotta
check in the game all right?

169
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:36,622
I got it I got it.

170
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,542
Downtown wastes no time
tagging out Bee Bee Ellis...

171
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:41,544
and Munson passes him the ball
immediately.

172
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,464
Downtown dribbles the ball through
his legs--I love it when he does that.

173
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,549
He's making mincemeat
of his defender here.

174
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:50,303
Downtown! If you want it!
If you--Only if you want it!

175
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,555
You don't want it I can feel it.
You don't want it OK.

176
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,724
That's right Nets.

177
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,727
You're not gonna stop it.
Believe me we don't stop it in practice.

178
00:07:57,810 --> 00:07:58,811
- Let's do it!
- Come on come on come on!

179
00:07:58,895 --> 00:08:00,480
- Go!
- You got it.

180
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,732
He tosses a three--

181
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:04,150
- And yes! Ha ha ha!
- Whoo!

182
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,235
- Wow! That was quite a shot.
- Pounce!

183
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,237
- Oh man!
- Yeah!

184
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:13,910
At halftime it's the Nets 62...

185
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,661
Flint Tropics 43.

186
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,372
All right, everybody,
let's hear it for Tropical time...

187
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,583
and let's hear it for Busch Bavarian.

188
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:26,339
If you're gonna drink a beer, you
might as well make it Busch Bavarian.

189
00:08:26,422 --> 00:08:29,091
Ladies and gentlemen
I want you to welcome this man...

190
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:34,096
who's gonna attempt the impossible--
the $10,000 free throw...

191
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,432
from the other side of the court.
The Moon shot.

192
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:38,392
- Right on. Ha.
- All right. Tell everybody...

193
00:08:38,476 --> 00:08:40,770

- Dukes. Ha ha.

194
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:42,355
- All right Dukes.

195
00:08:42,438 --> 00:08:44,440
- Dukes where ya from?
- Flint, Michigan...

196
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,816
and I never missed a game!

197
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,693
- Whoo!
- Go!

198
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:49,445
Dukes is homegrown.

199
00:08:49,529 --> 00:08:51,948
I think you're on a little somethin'
that's homegrown maybe, huh?

200
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:54,575
- Ha ha ha.
- Ha. We're havin' fun.

201
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,993
Dukes what do you do for a livin'?

202
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:58,246
Um...

203
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,288
nothin' right now.

204
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:01,874
Layin' low. Playin' it right.

205
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:04,210
What are you gonna do with all that money
if you win? Maybe buy a shirt?

206
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:06,546
Ha ha. Yeah man a shirt. Ha ha!

207
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:08,339
- Whoo!
- Dukes is excited!

208
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:09,632
So am I.

209
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,593
Come on let's go people.
Let's get it goin'.

210
00:09:12,677 --> 00:09:16,806
Cheer this guy on
as he prepares for the impossible.

211
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,308
Well, we've got
an especially dirty hippie here...

212
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,477
down on the court tryin' to sink
an impossible shot.

213
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:23,980
This is human drama at its best.

214
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:27,483
He's just focusing taking a moment
to concentrate. That's OK.

215
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:29,569
Concentrate all you want.

216
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:34,282
- Come on Dukes!
- All right.

217
00:09:34,365 --> 00:09:36,534
- Unh!
- Ohhhh--

218
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,035
- No!
- Yes!

219
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:39,996
Holy shit I'm a miracle!

220
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,831
Whoo!

221
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,333
Yeah!

222
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,502
Father Pat he stepped on the line.
He stepped on it.

223
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,545
- No no it was legal.
- No, no...

224
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:48,838
he stepped on the line
You were lookin' at it. Come on.

225
00:09:48,921 --> 00:09:50,131
Jackie he made the shot.

226
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,133
Who the hell has $10000?

227
00:09:52,216 --> 00:09:53,926
Relax the beer company'll pay him.

228
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,053
They're not really a sponsor
it just sounded professional.

229
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:57,722
- Whoo!
- Look at this guy.

230
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,057
He's so hopped up
on goofballs and grass...

231
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,684
he's got no idea what's going on.

232
00:10:01,767 --> 00:10:04,937
- Holy crap. Tropical!
- Ha ha ha ha!

233
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:08,858
- Hey congratulations to Dukes!
- Ha ha.

234
00:10:08,941 --> 00:10:11,193
- He just won a giant check--
- Ha ha.

235
00:10:11,277 --> 00:10:14,614
...that says $10000.

236
00:10:14,697 --> 00:10:16,324
Cool!

237
00:10:16,407 --> 00:10:18,701
- Whoo!
- Look at the size of that thing!

238
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,286
Go have yourself a ball!

239
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:23,164
Second half comin' up next!

240
00:10:23,247 --> 00:10:24,248
Damn it!

241
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,919
- # Hi #

242
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,547

00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,388
# Get the funk

245
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,057
# Get the funk outta my face #

246
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,893
# Get the funk
outta my face #

247
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,855
# You don't like my music
you don't have to use it #

248
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:52,943
# Funking is a thing
that all of us release #

249
00:10:53,027 --> 00:10:54,570
# You don't have to get it #

250
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:57,073
# All you do is let it #

251
00:10:57,156 --> 00:11:00,701
# Then you'll know
exactly how to groove #

252
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:03,704
Whoo. Ahh.

253
00:11:03,788 --> 00:11:05,414
Whew.

254
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:11,003
- Hey Jackie.

255
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:13,005
- How are the knees doing?

256
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,757
- Excellent.
- Are you drunk?

257
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,425
- Very. Ha ha.
- Ha ha ha!

258
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:20,429
# Now he's back home doing 9 to 5 #

259
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:24,058
# Living his gray flannel life #

260
00:11:24,141 --> 00:11:26,268
- Hey, Jackie.
- Hey guys everything good?

261
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,354

263
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,735
Hey DJ! Where's the boogie?

00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,654

266
00:11:37,863 --> 00:11:39,240

267
00:11:39,323 --> 00:11:41,158
Jackie you can't keep doing this.
I'm the DJ!

268
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:43,119
You gotta play it more than four times.
You know the rules.

269
00:11:43,202 --> 00:11:44,870
You're on snack patrol. Go.

270
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,295
You're a sexy town Flint.

271
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,839
Look at you I love it.

272
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:55,881
Whoo!

273
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:58,759
I swear if this Plexiglass
wasn't dividing us right now...

274
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:02,847
I'd make sweet tender love to each
and every one of you guys included.

275
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,432
Yeah!

276
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:05,474
Let me see a show of hands.

277
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,727
Who's got their funky passport on 'em?

278
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,311
Yeah. That's what I thought.

279
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:12,690
'Cause we're about to enter
the nation of gyration.

280
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,400
You're goin' on snack patrol Paul.

281
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,906
# Baby, who wants to love me sexy? #

282
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,576

288
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:39,341
Well she's hot right?

289
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,093
I mean we're freedom lovers.

290
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:43,554
Hey! Hey!

291
00:12:43,637 --> 00:12:45,097
She's great.

292
00:12:45,181 --> 00:12:46,474
I'm not jealous!

293
00:12:46,557 --> 00:12:48,100
I mean it's a great deal for both of us.

294
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,853
Yeah, but have you ever
slept with another woman?

295
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:53,355
I could. I mean that's the beauty of it.

296
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,357
No ball and chain here.

297
00:12:55,441 --> 00:12:57,693
And say I get asked to
come to an orgy right?

298
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,403
- Mm?
- I just do it.

299
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,280
Jackie ha ha wait a minute.

300
00:13:01,363 --> 00:13:03,282
Have you ever been to an orgy?

301
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:07,077
Are you crazy?
I just got back from an orgy.

302
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,788
Some guy named Steve's house.

303
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,915
I'm exhausted.

304
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:14,376
I mean my wiener said to me
"Jackie, I've had enough...

305
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:16,086
"of this orgy.

306
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,881
"Put me back in your underwear."

307
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:20,341
I'm tellin' ya man...

308
00:13:20,424 --> 00:13:22,968

and the shit is messed up.

309
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,178
It's a dang shame.

310
00:13:24,261 --> 00:13:27,306
I can't go back to working
at that car wash. No.

311
00:13:27,389 --> 00:13:29,809
I know there's some team out there
that can use the services of...

312
00:13:29,892 --> 00:13:32,228
"Downtown Funky Stuff" Malone
you hear me?

313
00:13:32,311 --> 00:13:35,898
I dig you, brother, but I heard
the problem ain't just here in Flint.

314
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,900
It's the whole league that's goin' under.

315
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:39,610

321
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,002

328
00:14:12,726 --> 00:14:13,936
- Yeah.

00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:44,592
Yeah first scene.

343
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:48,178
I remember that the credits
were still rollin' and everything.

344
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:52,641
Who the fuck is Bambi?

345
00:15:05,321 --> 00:15:07,323
Merger. Merger.

346
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:08,449
M--M--M--Merger.

347
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,075
Jackie Moon. Jackie Moon.

348
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:11,285
America.

349
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:14,496
Let's go. Let's do this.

350
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,665
Don't worry, Mom,
I won't let you down.

351
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:18,584
I'll keep this team alive.

352
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:21,253
Whew.

353
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:25,925
And our TV stations are complaining
about all the fighting.

354
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:30,429
Let's try to keep the fights in the tunnel
or out in the parking lot.

355
00:15:30,512 --> 00:15:33,557
Uh we have one more
piece of business to go over.

356
00:15:33,641 --> 00:15:37,269
I'm sure you've all heard the rumors
and they are true...

357
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:39,730
the ABA will be merging
with the NBA...

358
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,899
at the end of this season.

359
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:45,736
Yes. Yes.

360
00:15:47,696 --> 00:15:49,615
I did it.

361
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,116
I'm a real owner.

362
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,495
- Please Jackie let go.
- I did it.

363
00:15:54,578 --> 00:15:56,038
All right let's...

364
00:15:56,121 --> 00:15:57,456
not get too excited.

365
00:15:57,539 --> 00:15:59,708
Yes!
Give me ten Norton!

366
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,460
Everyone can eat shit!

367
00:16:01,543 --> 00:16:04,672
A big bag of shit! Ha ha ha!

368
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,257
I'm the greatest man in the world!

369
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:08,801
Whoo!

370
00:16:08,884 --> 00:16:11,512
The NBA has agreed
to our financial demands...

371
00:16:11,595 --> 00:16:13,138
- but there is something else--
- You were right Mom.

372
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,264
Destiny.

373
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:17,893
Oh, I'm so happy
I can't even feel my arms!

374
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,853
- Ha ha ha!
- OK Jackie listen to me. Jackie?

375
00:16:19,937 --> 00:16:21,647
- Hey Jackie?
- Yes?

376
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,484
Four teams will be absorbed
into the NBA next year.

377
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,444
The rest of the league
will terminate operations.

378
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:30,030
Exactly. You know it.

379
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:32,866
Wait.
Wait what did you say?

380
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:36,245
The Nets, the Spurs,
the Pacers and the Nuggets...

381
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:38,080
are gonna play in the NBA next season.

382
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:40,916
- The rest of us are gonna dissolve.
- Dissolve?

383
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,751
What's "dissolve"? Ha.

384
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,087
Is that even a word? Ha.

385
00:16:45,796 --> 00:16:47,297
Yes it is a word...

386
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:49,883
and financially it means
you'll cease to exist.

387
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,468
Let's don't get emotional about it.
Just--

388
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:53,012
No!

389
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,514
No!

390
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,224
OK.

391
00:16:57,307 --> 00:16:58,267
All right you're being--

392
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,518
- Ohh...ohh--
- Well Jackie. Jackie--

393
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:01,979
You--Don't bite yourself.
Come on.

394
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:05,357
Jackie we agreed to a very large sum.

395
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,985
I don't want a large sum OK?

396
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,738
I want my team.
Come on you guys...

397
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:14,158
you're not gonna just sit there
and take the money are you? Huh?

398
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:17,161
Ahem.

399
00:17:17,244 --> 00:17:19,329
What do the Nets have
that I don't have?!

400
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,831
The Nets have a huge fan base.

401
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,166
They got a brand-new stadium.

402
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:25,085
Solid economic growth package
with great tax incentives.

403
00:17:27,755 --> 00:17:30,174
Oh come on Alan that's bullshit!

404
00:17:31,383 --> 00:17:33,385
The NBA's gonna
take four teams Jackie.

405
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:34,762
This is a good deal.

406
00:17:40,267 --> 00:17:42,394
Best four teams should go.

407
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:46,732
He's right.
The season isn't over yet.

408
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:49,068
Hey, you know what? Yeah,
everybody should have a chance.

409
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,319
That's the fairest way.

410
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,488
Aw gee whiz...

411
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:54,490
that sounds like so much fun...

412
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,033
fair and all.

413
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,826
But come on guys...

414
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,037
I mean look at what
we're dealing with here.

415
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:03,207
This guy plays power forward
for his own team, so--

416
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,708
But he has a point.

417
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:07,544
Why not make the terms of
a merger performance-based.

418
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:08,587
- Exactly.
- Huh?

419
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:09,713
- What he just said.
- Yeah.

420
00:18:09,797 --> 00:18:11,465
I move we vote
on the terms of the merger.

421
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:13,258
- I second.
- And what he--what that guy said.

422
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:14,676
But--What--What both those guys said.

423
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,888
God damn it Bob! I'm about to reach
over there and tear you a new asshole!

424
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,014
Don't be a jackass.

425
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,974
- It makes sense.
- Fuck you Bob! We talked this out!

426
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,559
I don't see a need
for that kinda language.

427
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,228
Now if you wanna go outside
right now...

428
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:26,980
I'll take both of you fuckers out
right damn now!

429
00:18:27,064 --> 00:18:28,440
We're not gonna fight
we're gonna vote!

430
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:30,234
- Let's vote!
- Let's vote...

431
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:31,568
and then we'll fight!

432
00:18:31,652 --> 00:18:31,692
Come on guys...

433
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:33,570
Come on guys...

434
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,531
you should be juiced right now.

435
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,117
This is a chance to become
a real NBA franchise.

436
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,451
Man get outta town.

437
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,745
Ain't no way in Sam Hill
we gonna make it to fourth place.

438
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:42,788
- Nope.
- Yeah Jackie...

439
00:18:42,871 --> 00:18:44,873
we have a horseshit record right now.

440
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:47,793
Yeah well we just need to start
hittin' our threes OK?

441
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:50,462
That's not the problem Jackie.
The problem is...

442
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:51,922
we suck.

443
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:55,592
Scootsie you did not deserve that.

444
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:57,386
- I know.
- I apologize.

445
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:00,264
Stop that shit man.

446
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:03,517
We do not suck OK?

447
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,061
I been doin' a lot of thinkin'.

448
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:10,149
Decided to add someone to our team
to add some real firepower OK?

449
00:19:10,232 --> 00:19:12,609
I think this guy
could give us a new spark.

450
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:14,319
Now don't get mad.

451
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,947
- At point guard--
- At point guard?

452
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,615
...five-ten...

453
00:19:18,699 --> 00:19:21,243
I traded away our
washing machine to get him.

454
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,287
He punches in bunches.

455
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,331
Ed Monix!

456
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:31,044
Toilet's clogged.

457
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:33,881
Hell no.
You traded for Monix?

458
00:19:33,964 --> 00:19:35,424
Yeah.

459
00:19:35,507 --> 00:19:37,259
This guy's an old warrior come on.

460
00:19:37,342 --> 00:19:38,385
Yeah he old.

461
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,554
He can shoot the basketball.

462
00:19:40,637 --> 00:19:42,639
Most importantly,
he actually agreed to come here.

463
00:19:42,723 --> 00:19:44,349
So?

464
00:19:44,433 --> 00:19:49,897
It's a thrill to be in Flint.
Uh s--smells Tropical in here.

465
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,524
Now, look, I know
just about everyone...

466
00:19:52,608 --> 00:19:55,068
in this locker room has been
punched in the face by this guy...

467
00:19:55,152 --> 00:19:56,278
at some point in time.

468
00:19:56,361 --> 00:19:58,572
And maybe even one of us has...

469
00:19:58,655 --> 00:20:02,201
had his collarbone broken...twice.

470
00:20:02,284 --> 00:20:03,410
Sorry Twig.

471
00:20:03,493 --> 00:20:04,953
Thanks Ed.

472
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:07,289
Hey how are your mom and sister?

473
00:20:07,372 --> 00:20:09,958
It's been about 12 weeks
since I porked 'em.

474
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:14,588
Let's not talk about porking
of the moms and the sisters...

475
00:20:14,671 --> 00:20:17,466
because we only have
one rule on this team.

476
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:19,218
What is that rule Twiggy?

477
00:20:19,301 --> 00:20:20,302
E-L-E.

478
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,054
That's right E-L-E.

479
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,555
And what does "E-L-E" stand for?

480
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:27,309
- "Everybody Love Everybody".
- "Everybody Love Everybody".

481
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:28,852
Right there up on the wall.

482
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:30,646
Got that Monix?

483
00:20:30,729 --> 00:20:32,064
- Nope.
- Great.

484
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:34,358
'Cause this isn't just
a basketball team...

485
00:20:34,441 --> 00:20:36,902
this is a lifestyle.

486
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,195
Welcome aboard Monix.

487
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:39,529
Thank you.
Good to be here.

488
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,406
All right.

489
00:20:41,490 --> 00:20:44,284
Oh if you see a possum...

490
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:46,954
try to kill it OK?

491
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,580
It's not a pet.

492
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,755
Welcome back to Tropics Weekly.

493
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:58,590
The ABA has announced...

494
00:20:58,674 --> 00:21:02,970
that the top four teams will merge
with the NBA after this season.

495
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,012
Seizing the opportunity...

496
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:08,433
owner/player/coach Jackie Moon
has already made the first move...

497
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:11,019
acquiring Ed Monix
from the Kentucky Colonels.

498
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,229
Yeah!

499
00:21:12,312 --> 00:21:13,897
I'm a pretty aggressive owner.

500
00:21:13,981 --> 00:21:17,484
Uh when I heard Kentucky needed
a washing machine I looked at ours...

501
00:21:17,567 --> 00:21:19,319
even though we need ours.

502
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:21,363
Uh I said "I gotta pull the trigger on this."

503
00:21:21,446 --> 00:21:22,948
- Hey honey!
- It seemed appropriate.

504
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,701
- Guess who got traded to Flint?
- Who?

505
00:21:25,784 --> 00:21:26,952
Monix!

506
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,831
Why the hell would he
want to come to Flint?

507
00:21:32,165 --> 00:21:33,834
I have no idea.

508
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,253
Who cares right? I mean--

509
00:21:36,336 --> 00:21:39,047
He's got an NBA ring
and he's playing for the Tropics.

510
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:40,549
Can you believe that?

511
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:42,801
No I can't.

512
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,722
I'll get it.

513
00:21:46,805 --> 00:21:49,975
It's like if you watch a porn movie
doesn't mean you got laid.

514
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:53,186
No no. In fact it--
it often means the opposite.

515
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:55,897
Monix was an All-American
at Michigan State...

516
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:57,065
then went on to--

517
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,191
- Hey.
- Hey.

518
00:21:58,275 --> 00:21:59,234
You look great.

519
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,319
Why are you here?

520
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:03,905
Uh got traded. Yeah. Yeah.

521
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,116
I--I mean why are you--you here?

522
00:22:07,492 --> 00:22:08,827
Can we talk?

523
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:12,372
- Monix! Ha ha ha!
- Hey.

524
00:22:12,456 --> 00:22:13,415
- Oh what's up?
- Yeah.

525
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:15,000
That ol' jump shot of yours
ain't broke yet, is it?

526
00:22:15,083 --> 00:22:16,710
- Not yet.
- Ha ha ha!

527
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:18,962
Oh man--Oh hey!

528
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:20,005
Great backdoor cut...

529
00:22:20,088 --> 00:22:22,591
for the lay-up against the Amigos
last Friday night man.

530
00:22:22,674 --> 00:22:25,427
Yeah ha ha. That's the way
basketball should be played!

531
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,511
- Yeah.
- Up there.

532
00:22:26,595 --> 00:22:29,765
- Yeah--
- Too slow! Ha ha ha!

533
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,725
Hey can you give us a second please?

534
00:22:31,808 --> 00:22:35,103
- Yeah no problem.
- Thanks, Kyle.

535
00:22:35,187 --> 00:22:37,356
Oh Monix!

536
00:22:37,439 --> 00:22:39,524
Why does your boyfriend like me
so much?

537
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,401
You're his favorite player.

538
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,653
I'd feel more comfortable
if he hated me.

539
00:22:43,737 --> 00:22:48,158
Listen I hope you didn't agree
to this trade because of me.

540
00:22:49,201 --> 00:22:51,536
What if I did?

541
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:55,415
Then you'd be stuck
in Flint Michigan for no reason.

542
00:22:55,499 --> 00:22:56,458
You know what?

543
00:22:56,541 --> 00:22:58,460
You said you wanted to leave basketball
at the top of your game.

544
00:22:58,543 --> 00:22:59,628
When are you gonna quit?

545
00:22:59,711 --> 00:23:03,715
I'm at the top of my game.
I'm very close to the top.

546
00:23:07,302 --> 00:23:11,306
I just got traded for a fuckin' washing
machine. What am I talkin' about?

547
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:13,100
Good night Ed.

548
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,771
Thanks for the pep talk.

549
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,906
Ed Monix is a tenacious defender
and he can hit the big shots.

550
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:31,243
- Mm when he's not drunk.
- Which is never.

551
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,870
Look there's nothing in the rule book
that says you can't play drunk.

552
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,288
No actually there is.

553
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,332
Remember those 30 rebounds
against San Diego?

554
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,334
- Yeah.
- I don't remember 'em.

555
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,335
Oh no.

556
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:41,962
- Amaretto stone sours.
- Yes.

557
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:43,505
- I will never believe that.
- All game long.

558
00:23:43,588 --> 00:23:45,340
- No way.
- I mixed 'em!

559
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,968
Doesn't leave the table.

560
00:23:48,051 --> 00:23:50,011
Look guys you ain't gotta worry.

561
00:23:50,095 --> 00:23:53,473
'Cause tomorrow when I get this cast
taken off I'll be back on the team...

562
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:56,059
and I will be rainin' down some threes!

563
00:23:56,143 --> 00:23:59,771
Cornelius you're a good friend
but that arm hasn't properly healed...

564
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,816
and I've told you 100 times
you're never gonna play for the Tropics.

565
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,109
You're a terrible athlete.

566
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:08,405
Come on man! I'm a excellent athlete.
Look I broke this arm playin' for you.

567
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,575
No, you broke it
playing with me in the driveway.

568
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:12,826
You can't even make a lay-up.

569
00:24:12,909 --> 00:24:15,203
I'm an injured player man.
I should be on the bench.

570
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:17,080
No you're not on the team.

571
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:19,541
Well in my fantasy life
I'm on the team.

572
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:22,294
Well let's just keep it that way right?

573
00:24:22,377 --> 00:24:24,880
Oh my God. What the fuck is that?
It's incredible.

574
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,339
It's called fondue.

575
00:24:26,423 --> 00:24:29,009
- Fon what?
- Fondue.

576
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:33,054
Three different cheeses melted.
That's what you're tasting.

577
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,640
Gorgonzola muenster and cottage.

578
00:24:35,724 --> 00:24:37,642
It's the latest thing
from Sweden apparently.

579
00:24:37,726 --> 00:24:40,979
Well, I'm not surprised by that.
The Swedes are so inventive aren't they?

580
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:42,189
- Oh, they are.
- Yep.

581
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,983
They are my favorite producers
of pornography.

582
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,319
They make an excellent fuck picture.

583
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:51,281
Well I think I'll excuse myself
from this conversation right now.

584
00:24:51,364 --> 00:24:53,241
- To the men's room.
- Oh, stop it!

585
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,409
To make your wiener sing.

586
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,453
Boner machine.

587
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,246
I am not a boner machine now.

588
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,207
Swedish porn saved my life in 'Nam.

589
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:01,791
- OK.
- Great here we go.

590
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,085
- Come on! Fuck you guys!
- Let me get my violin.

591
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,086
Swedish porn was the only thing...

592
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,255
that kept my mind off Charlie
when I was in the shit.

593
00:25:07,339 --> 00:25:10,550
Is the shit in Ann Arbor? 'Cause
that's where you were during the war.

594
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,928
- He really believes it.
- You were never in 'Nam--

595
00:25:13,011 --> 00:25:14,763
- Nope. Ha ha.
- ...you jive turkey.

596
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,944
You just call me a jive turkey?

597
00:25:31,071 --> 00:25:33,198
No. No he did not.

598
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:37,452
- He uh called you cocksucker.
- Yeah.

599
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:38,578
- Yeah.
- Right--Right Cornelius?

600
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:40,455
Yeah, yeah.
I just called you cocksucker.

601
00:25:40,539 --> 00:25:43,041
I'm pretty sure that
you called me a jive turkey.

602
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:47,295
No, no. Now, Lou,
nobody called anyone a JT.

603
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,798
Jive turkey is a little over the line
my man!

604
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,299
Look we're all here.

605
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:53,635
We all heard what was said
and we're in agreement.

606
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:55,595
- Cornelius said cocksucker.
- Yes.

607
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:56,638
- Right?
- Yeah.

608
00:25:56,721 --> 00:26:00,308
- He just said you suck cock.
- That's all he said about you.

609
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:03,770
Now come on. Dig into that fondue
you little cocksucker.

610
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:07,983
- We like playing games, don't we?
- We do we're playing one right now!

611
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,195
I'm gonna show you guys
this game that I learned...

612
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,823
- when I was in fucking 'Nam!
- Oh no no no no!

613
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:16,283
Lou. Lou.

614
00:26:16,366 --> 00:26:18,535
Who's the jive turkey now?

615
00:26:22,455 --> 00:26:23,999
Ah ha ha ha ha!

616
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,293
Gun's not loaded!

617
00:26:26,376 --> 00:26:29,796
- You son of a bitch!
- It's not loaded! It's not loaded!

618
00:26:29,879 --> 00:26:32,966
You shoulda seen your goddamn face!

619
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,552
Oh there's no bullets in there!
I never load it!

620
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:38,346
The gun was not loaded.

621
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:41,349
I'll see you fuckers in hell!

622
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:45,270
Ohh!

623
00:26:45,812 --> 00:26:48,607
Jackie, Love Me Sexy
is the worst song I've ever heard.

624
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,113
Watch this! I did call you jive turkey.

625
00:26:55,196 --> 00:26:56,740
He did!

626
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:02,370
I got one. Hey, Lou, I know
you slept with Mrs. Pepperfield!

627
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:04,247
Grrr!

628
00:27:05,373 --> 00:27:08,168
We're saying nutty things
'cause they're not true.

629
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:11,046
- My! Yeah.
- Especially that. More than the rest.

630
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:13,798
- He's jonesing you.
- It never happened. Ha ha.

631
00:27:13,882 --> 00:27:15,759
- Hey. Bond.
- She's not ugly.

632
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:18,178
- James Bond. Huh?
- Oh there it is.

633
00:27:18,261 --> 00:27:21,556
- How do you like your martini sir?
- Stirred, in--in a half-carafe.

634
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,058
Wow.

635
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,103
- He shoots himself.
- He shoots himself in the wiener.

636
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:38,239
- Everybody OK?
- I think so.

637
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:39,908
- Yeah.
- I'm fine.

638
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:42,118
Wow!

639
00:27:42,202 --> 00:27:45,246
We just literally dodged a bullet.
Ha ha ha ha!

640
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:47,874
We sure did!

641
00:27:47,957 --> 00:27:49,584
- We certainly--
- Except for Cornelius.

642
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,419
Ohh!

643
00:27:51,503 --> 00:27:54,714
Oh ho ho. I did get shot!

644
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,843
- Oh my God.
- Wow!

645
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:15,276
# Short people got no reason #

646
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,280
# Short people got
no reason #

647
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:23,410
# Short people got no reason to live #

648
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:25,286
Come on everyone! Yeah!

649
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,039
- What do they got Bobby?
- # They got little hands #

650
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,290
Yeah little hands.

651
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:31,418
- # Little eyes #
- # Little eyes #

652
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:34,462
- # Walk around telling great big lies #
- # Great big lies #

653
00:28:34,546 --> 00:28:36,673
# They got little noses #

654
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:39,175
- # And tiny little teeth #
- Tiny little teeth!

655
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:42,178
# Platform shoes on their nasty little feet #

656
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:46,307
- # Well I don't want no short people #
- Let's go, Tropics!

657
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:50,061
- I hate 'em. I don't want no short people!
- # I don't want no short people #

658
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,896
I'm talking about you Scootsie!

659
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:54,357
I'm just kidding man you're not that
short.

660
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,775
You're the best.

661
00:28:55,859 --> 00:28:57,402
I'm exaggerating.

662
00:28:58,319 --> 00:29:00,113
Vakidis open the window will ya?

663
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:01,489
Yes right on.

664
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:05,368
Did you give Bobby Dee a hand job?

665
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,245
Yes right on.

666
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:12,250
# Oh, yeah #

667
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:14,294
Hey Jackie it's your wife!

668
00:29:14,377 --> 00:29:16,045
Hey Stacey! Hey honey!

669
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,047
Oh hey lady.

670
00:29:18,131 --> 00:29:21,134
- # Mr. Big Stuff #
- Hi!

671
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:22,886
# You're never gonna get my love #

672
00:29:22,969 --> 00:29:24,512
My God would you look at those?

673
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:26,723
Yes I will.

674
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:29,100
Oh! Mm!

675
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,688
That's what I'm
talking about, baby.

676
00:29:33,772 --> 00:29:35,398
- Yes!
- Slow down!

677
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:38,026
Bye baby I love you.

678
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:39,486
- Say Jackie.
- Yeah.

679
00:29:39,569 --> 00:29:42,113
Have you ever even
slept with your wife, man?

680
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:46,367
Are you kidding me? Come on.
Yeah like every weekend.

681
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,745
- And it's hot!
- Yeah I believe you.

682
00:29:48,828 --> 00:29:50,955
I believe you lying. Ha ha ha!

683
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:57,796
Hey Monix...

684
00:29:57,879 --> 00:29:59,756
what were the Celtics like?

685
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,508
Well they were fast.

686
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:04,969
Fast? Man. Clarence should play
for the Celtics then. That boy can fly.

687
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,763
Downtown,
that's all he ever talk about.

688
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:08,973
"I'm goin' to the NBA, I'm goin'
to the NBA." Every day he say that.

689
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:11,434
No, I don't.
Why don't you just shut up man?

690
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:15,271
Say Monix why don't you let us
see that championship ring, m

691
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,689
Don't think nobody here ever seen...

692
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:18,316
- a championship ring before.
- Uh-uh.

693
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:19,526
- All right.
- Yes sir.

694
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,236
- Yes!
- Yo man let me see it!

695
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:23,696
Oh! Holy balls.

696
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:26,574
Oh my God look at this right here.
"Champion" in sparkling gold.

697
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:28,409
Man why are you wearing that
on your neck?

698
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,703
If I had a ring like that
I'd have it on my finger every day...

699
00:30:30,787 --> 00:30:32,747
so the honeys could see it.

700
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:34,499
I'm not quite as flashy as you.

701
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:37,126
I just like wearing it
around my neck that's all.

702
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,837
- That's cool man.
- I hear that.

703
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,339
He should be embarrassed.

704
00:30:42,757 --> 00:30:44,843
Embarrassed?

705
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:47,846
He sat through every playoff game.

706
00:30:47,929 --> 00:30:50,682
Then he gonna walk around us
with all the shine...

707
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,767
like he some kind of hero or somethin'.

708
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:55,728
Oh come on Clarence.
You're just actin' jealous.

709
00:30:55,812 --> 00:31:02,110
Whatever. I ain't never rode the bench
and then go call myself a champion.

710
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,905
Somebody need to snatch that ring
off his sorry neck.

711
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:07,448
- You wanna snatch it? Come on.
- I--

712
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:09,617
- Be my guest.
- I don't think your knees can take it.

713
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:13,413
Hey! Hey I got a ring up here too.
Mine says love.

714
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,125
Think about that.

715
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,338
Everybody love everybody!

716
00:31:22,422 --> 00:31:23,965
Come on!

717
00:31:24,048 --> 00:31:26,301
Eleven more hours to go.

718
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:32,307
Another easy basket
for the Spirits.

719
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:34,392
Tropics with the ball.

720
00:31:36,019 --> 00:31:37,812
Hey honey!

721
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,857
Jackie Moon waving to the fans
as he makes his way down the court.

722
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,066
Keep it alive right here!
Throw it in the blender.

723
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,109
He truly is a showman.

724
00:31:43,192 --> 00:31:44,444
No! Changed my mind.
Right back, though.

725
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,404
- OK. OK.
- Right back to you. Give it back again!

726
00:31:46,487 --> 00:31:47,822
- You got it.
- No right back.

727
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,365
- No?
- Yeah. Yeah. Whoa.

728
00:31:49,449 --> 00:31:52,076
- Sure?
- Yeah. Right back. Come on now. No.

729
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,912
Right back reset.
Throw it to Papa.

730
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:54,996
- No right back out.
- All right.

731
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,539
- Right back. Right back.
- Here you go, Jackie.

732
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:57,832
- Back to you. Right back though.
- You're right. OK.

733
00:31:57,916 --> 00:31:58,875
- Shoot!
- Whoo!

734
00:31:58,958 --> 00:32:00,084
- All right right on.
- Clear. Yeah.

735
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:01,544
- You ready?
- No right back.

736
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,046
- No?
- Yeah. OK clear.

737
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:04,088
- All right I'm goin'.
- My turn.

738
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,466
Yeah I'll bet my alleged son
he won't make this.

739
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:08,676
Jackie Moon
finally making a move...

740
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,554
- and it is worth the wait!
- All day long! Whoo!

741
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:12,597
Way to go Jackie!

742
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,682
- Traveling!
- No no no no! One and a half steps!

743
00:32:14,766 --> 00:32:19,687
- Come on, Jackie. You walked.
- Suck my cock! I'll murder your family!

744
00:32:20,897 --> 00:32:22,148
- You're gone Jackie Moon!
- What? What?

745
00:32:22,231 --> 00:32:24,692
- Jackie Moon is ejected from the game.

746
00:32:24,776 --> 00:32:26,986
- What did I say?
- You said "S my C ."

747
00:32:29,572 --> 00:32:32,575
And one lucky fan
will go home with a game ball.

748
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:33,785
That's your head next time.

749
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:35,161
You're a big baby Jackie.
You cannot tell me to S my C .

750
00:32:35,244 --> 00:32:37,288
Jackie Moon and the referee
really going at it here.

751
00:32:37,372 --> 00:32:39,248
- I didn't say anything.
- You said "S my C ."

752
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:41,459
- I barely raised my voice.
- I should call your mother.

753
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:43,795
You need a phone to heaven to do that.

754
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:45,838
- Maybe your ma didn't go to heaven.
- Oh dear.

755
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,549
Oh. Oh my. Oh no.

756
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:51,427
OK. Everyone off the floor.
Let's go. Tropics, let's go.

757
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,679
Why--No Jackie.

758
00:32:52,762 --> 00:32:56,307
It appears a line has been crossed
by Father Pat of all people.

759
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,643
- Look Jackie I'm sorry.
- Stop the broadcast.

760
00:32:58,726 --> 00:33:02,480
Jackie Moon is pulling his team
off the court.

761
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:04,565
You forfeit this game Jackie
if you keep walking.

762
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:08,277
- That's fine.
- You threatened to kill my family!

763
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,279
God damn it, Pat.
What the hell's wrong with you?

764
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,948
Don't get on your high horse Redwood.

765
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:14,200
You've got a lot of demons yourself.

766
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:15,243
Thank you for staying Dick.

767
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,577
No I am leaving.

768
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,954
I've thrown to commercial.

769
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:20,873
I have to be back in about 30 seconds
or so but this is symbolic.

770
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:22,250
We go to church together.

771
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:23,251
Not anymore.

772
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,920
# Hey Flint Tropics welcome back #

773
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:28,423
- # Give the Amigos a heart attack #
- I tried Jackie.

774
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,508
They won't take it.

775
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:32,719
Look, I--I don't know
what your bank is telling you.

776
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:35,013
This is a real check.
I signed it myself.

777
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:37,306
It's written in glitter man.

778
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:41,436
Can't you just you know like
write me a regular-size check?

779
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:44,439
Maybe you should try a different bank.
A big bank.

780
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:46,691
- Bigger bank?
- That has a big check department.

781
00:33:46,774 --> 00:33:48,317
- That's what I'd do.
- OK.

782
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:50,028
- Right? All right.
- Yeah.

783
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:50,152
Whoo Scootsie he is takin' you to town!

784
00:33:50,153 --> 00:33:52,363
Whoo Scootsie he is takin' you to town!

785
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,490
Get him Twig. C'mon!

786
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:57,535
There we go.

787
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:59,662
- All right guys. Hey listen up.
- Hey hey.

788
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:03,791
Let's go. Eyes up here.
Turn that contraption off. Come on.

789
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:07,045
Look uh just got off the phone
with the Commissioner.

790
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,881
He convinced the board
to pass another merger rule.

791
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:13,509
We gotta average 2,000 fans per
home game for the rest of the season.

792
00:34:13,593 --> 00:34:14,552
Ahhh.

793
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,262
- Two thou every home game?
- Damn. What?

794
00:34:16,345 --> 00:34:19,474
Commissioner says they're not gonna
take a franchise that doesn't have fans.

795
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,310
- He's being a real dick.
- Good Lord Jackie Moon.

796
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:28,066
Winning these games is gonna be hard
but 2000 fans? Impossible man.

797
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:31,194
It's OK, Scootsie.
'Cause I got a plan. All right?

798
00:34:31,277 --> 00:34:34,155
Now, you all know
we're the ABA game of the week right?

799
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:37,867
Could be a lot of television cameras
out there, so we just gotta be tiptop.

800
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:39,702
So what's the plan?

801
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:41,120
I brought a secret weapon.

802
00:34:41,204 --> 00:34:43,372
It's gonna make us
look extra cool on TV.

803
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,083
What the hell is that?

804
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,418
- It's eyeliner dummy.
- Oh--

805
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,921
Now who's first? Monix?

806
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:55,259
Oh yeah. Just let me get a fresh Maxi Pad
out of my purse.

807
00:34:56,719 --> 00:35:00,973
Looks like Jackie Moon has brought a
trick from Broadway to the court tonight.

808
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,393
Trap trap trap trap trap.

809
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,645
Point of no return.
Go back. Go back.

810
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,563
Horse in the trailer.
Nowhere to go.

811
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,732
Hey. Look at my eyes.
No look at my eyes.

812
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:12,360
Are you scared? Tropical storm.
Eye of the hurricane.

813
00:35:12,443 --> 00:35:15,113
I'm gonna hypnotize you.
I'm not gonna blink. I'm not gonna blink.

814
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:17,824
- Look at me.
- Where you goin'? Where you goin'?

815
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,367
Jackie tips the ball away.

816
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,993
Twiggy picks it up and takes it in.

817
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,871
- Two points, Tropics.
- Way to go Twiggy!

818
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:25,748
Make sure the camera gets your eyes!

819
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,041
This team is on fire--

820
00:35:27,125 --> 00:35:28,584
- Oooooh!
- ...early in the game.

821
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:29,752
Oh they're flaming all right.

822
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:32,713
Nice lay-up.
Nice lay-up Twiggy huh?

823
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:35,675
- Who's got character now?
- My confidence is sky-high right now.

824
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,177
Oh! Ohh! Ohh!

825
00:35:38,261 --> 00:35:40,805
- What's with Vakidis?
- Ohh! Ahh! Oh ha ha!

826
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:43,057
- What the hell's wrong with Vakidis?
- I don't know man.

827
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:46,018
Oh shit! Your eyeliner's running.

828
00:35:46,102 --> 00:35:48,354
Oh yeah. Yours is kinda smoky too.

829
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,689
All right everyone.
Try not to sweat if you can.

830
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,732
Hell no. This--this shit
burnin' already, man.

831
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:53,401
- Yeah it kinda is.
- Goddamn.

832
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,986
- Oh.
- I'm going to the bench man. Move!

833
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:56,070
- What's happening?
- Shit!

834
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:58,197
The Tropics seem to be
disabled in some way.

835
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,408
God it burns. Whoo!

836
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:03,578
Do they test this on animals
or is that just a lie?

837
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,621
Feels like I got cat piss in my eyes!

838
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,707
Just open your eyes with your fingers
guys. It's really nice.

839
00:36:07,790 --> 00:36:09,292
Cock sandwich that hurts!

840
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:10,626
- Fuckin' idiots.
- That feels really good.

841
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:13,254
Monix where's your makeup
huh buddy?

842
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:16,591
Hey how come it says Monix on
your jersey when your name's Pussy?

843
00:36:16,674 --> 00:36:18,593
- I was curious about this--
- Fuck you, Petrelli.

844
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,845
- Hey, hey, Monix!
- Get your hands off me!

845
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:23,973
- Get back here! You little bitch!
- We're on TV!

846
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:26,642
- I don't give a shit!
- Commissioner's watching.

847
00:36:26,726 --> 00:36:29,770
- You wanna kill the merger? C'mon.
- Everybody relax.

848
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:32,607
Looks like a little gentleman's
disagreement on the court. Nothing big.

849
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,108
No these girls aren't gonna fight.

850
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:37,028
No but a little bit of a delay
in play for a moment here.

851
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:39,739
What about during commercial?

852
00:36:39,822 --> 00:36:42,575
Yeah I like it. Yeah it's good.

853
00:36:42,658 --> 00:36:46,037
- Uh, Father Pat, timeout.
- Timeout white!

854
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,790
It's a timeout on the floor with 9 minutes
and 16 seconds left in the first.

855
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,459
The Tropics two the Amigos six.

856
00:36:51,542 --> 00:36:54,921
And we'll be right back
after these messages from Shasta.

857
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,505
And clear.

858
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,007
Somebody hit somebody!

859
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,300
Raaah!

860
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,137
Oh here we go.

861
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:07,141
- Come on!
- Get him!

862
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:11,312
Ohhh this is a good old-fashioned
bare-fisted brawl here on the court.

863
00:37:11,395 --> 00:37:13,439
My goodness.

864
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,860
Look at the Russian bear go.
Throwing people around like rag dolls.

865
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:22,615
Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends?

866
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:25,534
Oh, look at Monix take it to Petrelli.
I wish the people at home could see this.

867
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:26,577
I could hurt someone.

868
00:37:26,661 --> 00:37:30,665
New Red Apple Soda with a great
taste and tingle they're still looking for.

869
00:37:30,748 --> 00:37:33,167
# Why can't we be friends? #

870
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:35,211
# Why can't we be friends? #

871
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:38,130
- # Why can't we be friends? #
- Get him! Get him!

872
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:40,758
# Why can't we be friends?
Why can't we be friends? #

873
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:44,178
Honestly Dick I could watch this all day.
This is terr--Oh, look at Father Pat!

874
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,347
Father Pat is getting
the worst of a lot of this.

875
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,015
Ah! Stop!

876
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,934
- # Why can't we be friends? #
- And we're back in three--

877
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:52,687
- # Why can't we be friends? #
- ...two one...

878
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:56,274
Welcome back
to your ABA game of the week.

879
00:37:56,357 --> 00:37:58,317
I'll tell you, the spirit
and camaraderie of this league...

880
00:37:58,401 --> 00:38:00,444
is on full display here tonight Lou.

881
00:38:00,528 --> 00:38:03,406
Yeah yeah you got that right Dick.

882
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,490
Lou!

883
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,159
Scoreboard's
not looking good guys.

884
00:38:07,243 --> 00:38:09,578
Think it's time for us to make
some serious adjustments.

885
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:11,163
Here's the chalk Coach.

886
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:20,381
Huh? That's right.
That's how frustrated I am.

887
00:38:20,464 --> 00:38:24,010
OK? I can stand here and I can talk
X's and O's all day long...

888
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:26,262
but this is about something else.

889
00:38:26,345 --> 00:38:27,888
We're not playing Tropical.

890
00:38:28,848 --> 00:38:30,516
We're playing tight.

891
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:33,894
I mean if we just open up our hearts
and let our passion come out...

892
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,813
we can do anything.

893
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,482
You ready?

894
00:38:38,566 --> 00:38:41,319
Now my wife has volunteered
to bring our passion out.

895
00:38:42,528 --> 00:38:46,073
Hello lady luck
let negative static be gone.

896
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,243
- # Baby, who wants to love me sexy? #
- Ow!

897
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:52,163
Whoo! Hello Stacey Moon!

898
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:53,914
- Hey boys.
- Oh yeah.

899
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:56,083
All right. Whoo!

900
00:38:56,167 --> 00:38:57,918
- # Lick me sexy #
- Can you feel it?

901
00:38:58,002 --> 00:39:00,755
- Already a different locker room.
- Just like that.

902
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:03,049
Ha ha. There it goes.

903
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,718
Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife.

904
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,511
This is the best idea I've ever had.

905
00:39:07,595 --> 00:39:08,929
Great work Stacey.

906
00:39:09,013 --> 00:39:11,599
Oh Twiggy welcome to the big city.

907
00:39:11,682 --> 00:39:12,850
- Ha ha.
- Ooh!

908
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:14,268
Jackie I don't--I don't know
about this, Jackie.

909
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,311
- Ha ha ha!
- Damn.

910
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:16,854
Believe it! This is happening!

911
00:39:16,937 --> 00:39:19,148
- Downtown.
- Yeah.

912
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:21,525
Yeah you can call me Downtown.

913
00:39:21,609 --> 00:39:25,571
Oh! Nice jumpin' joint!
Aah! Ha ha ha!

914
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:28,532
Pep talk! All right.
What team's in a rut now?

915
00:39:29,575 --> 00:39:33,204
Not the Tropics anymore no sirree.
We got strong--

916
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,290
Jesus this guy's a bummer.

917
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,667
Does anybody here wanna talk
about the fucking game?

918
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,795
Hey. Watch your language.
Not in front of my wife.

919
00:39:40,878 --> 00:39:43,464
Uh sorry Mrs. Moon.

920
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:47,593
Come on, man. Trying to bring the love
into the room and all you do is complain.

921
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:50,805
My wife is standing here naked.
What more do you want me to do?

922
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:54,642
Listen Jackie th--there is
no shortcut to winning.

923
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:57,269
You can't buy it you can't pray for it...

924
00:39:57,353 --> 00:40:01,941
and you can't stare at your wife's ass
and start hitting three-pointers.

925
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:05,111
We need a game plan Jackie.

926
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:07,947
So he the expert. He should know.

927
00:40:08,030 --> 00:40:09,532
He done seen the game
from every angle...

928
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:10,991
- sittin' on the bench.
- Damn!

929
00:40:11,075 --> 00:40:15,287
Hey, guess what? The Celtics weren't
just all-stars, they were a team. A team!

930
00:40:15,371 --> 00:40:19,750
As opposed to a bunch of selfish
assholes tryin' to look cool every night.

931
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,460
I mean call us what you want to...

932
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:25,047
but we ain't never sat around
and pretended like we some champions.

933
00:40:25,131 --> 00:40:31,804
Yeah you got a little ring and all
but you personally you ain't won shit.

934
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:37,059
Clarence I want you to have this ring...

935
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:41,480
as a token
of what you will never achieve.

936
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:44,525
Champion or not,
at least I played the game.

937
00:40:44,608 --> 00:40:46,402
And I got news for you Clarence...

938
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:50,364
for all your flash
you are never gonna play in the NBA.

939
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:53,451
You are pissing your career away.

940
00:40:53,534 --> 00:40:56,162
And one day
you're gonna look back on your life...

941
00:40:56,245 --> 00:41:01,250
and you're gonna realize that you never
even learned how to play basketball.

942
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:24,190
Oh jeez!

943
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,275
What the hell?

944
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:29,403
Shit.

945
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,489
Get your hands in the air.

946
00:41:37,077 --> 00:41:39,079
Monix bail's been set.

947
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,046
Lynn can I ask you a favor?

948
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:50,007
Oh you mean besides
bailing your ass outta jail?

949
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,842
Lynn no one can drain it like you.

950
00:41:53,385 --> 00:41:56,347
I think I drained all I can
out of there.

951
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,557
- That hurt?
- Mm. Not really.

952
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,935
- How about that?
- Ah...yeah.

953
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:02,436
- Good.
- Ha.

954
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:09,026
Listen uh this is long overdue
but I wanna apologize.

955
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,238
For what?

956
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:17,618
For uh you know back then
we had some problems.

957
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:21,413
Oh did you wanna apologize
for cheating on me?

958
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,791
Twice.

959
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,417
Hey I cheated on you once.

960
00:42:25,501 --> 00:42:28,879
There--There just happened
to be two girls there ha ha.

961
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,174
- Still not funny?
- Still not funny.

962
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:35,511
And where's the necklace I made you?

963
00:42:38,514 --> 00:42:40,849
Monix it was the high point
of your career.

964
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:43,644
- Riding the bench?
- You didn't just ride the bench.

965
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:45,646
Who did the Celtics practice against?

966
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,148
- Second stringers.
- Second stringers...

967
00:42:48,232 --> 00:42:50,484
and every day you pushed
your team to the limit.

968
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:52,987
I know I was there I was the one
working on your stupid knee.

969
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:54,738
I didn't deserve that ring Lynn.

970
00:42:54,822 --> 00:42:58,951
I hardly played.
I was never the guy to hit the big shot.

971
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:01,662
Wanna know why
things didn't work out between us?

972
00:43:01,745 --> 00:43:02,663
Yeah.

973
00:43:02,746 --> 00:43:07,084
You hate yourself so much
it's impossible to love you.

974
00:43:07,167 --> 00:43:09,003
Wow .

975
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:11,338
Kinda brutally honest.

976
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,677
Did we have some fun?

977
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:18,095
You're kind of fun.

978
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,889
Didn't we?

979
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,392
Sometimes.

980
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,318
- What are you doing?
- There he is.

981
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:34,069
Whoo ooh. Ha ha.

982
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,904
- Been lookin' all over for you.
- 'Bout time...

983
00:43:35,988 --> 00:43:37,531

984
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:40,284
See ya later Ed. 'Scuse me guys.

985
00:43:40,367 --> 00:43:41,327
Excused.

986
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:45,080
Uh doin' your girl in the locker room

987
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,499
- What are you guys doin' here?
- Ahem.

988
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,669
We want you to coach the team.

989
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,963
- What?
- You know the game better than Jackie.

990
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:57,092
I'm flattered but I don't think
Jackie would be too happy about this.

991
00:43:57,176 --> 00:44:00,721
Come on don't worry about Jackie.
I mean I got this.

992
00:44:00,804 --> 00:44:02,264
OK Tropics hustle up.

993
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,893
Five six seven eight.

994
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:09,938
One and two and three and four
and turn like you mean it.

995
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:11,273
Arch that back Bee Bee.

996
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:13,734
I like it. Whoo! Good rotation.

997
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:14,985
Beautiful seahorses.

998
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:16,320
Leg kick Scootsie.

999
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:19,323
Nice! And freeze it.

1000
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,120
And then we start the game.

1001
00:44:25,204 --> 00:44:26,163
Now when I say freeze it...

1002
00:44:26,246 --> 00:44:28,832
you guys gotta freeze it OK?

1003
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:31,752
- Hey!
- Hey.

1004
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:33,379
You're back. All right.

1005
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:36,507
We got a extra costume
right over there for you.

1006
00:44:36,590 --> 00:44:41,261
I'm not here to do wh--whatever this is.
What is this?

1007
00:44:41,345 --> 00:44:43,055
What is this? Ha ha.

1008
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:47,101
Come on man this is--
this is the future of basketball OK?

1009
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:50,771
This is entertainment.
You'll get it. You'll catch on.

1010
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:52,022
Ah--

1011
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,113
Look Jackie. Now don't get mad
but some--some of us got together...

1012
00:44:59,196 --> 00:45:01,740
and we asked old Monix
if he'd teach us a little bit.

1013
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,867
Wait what do you mean teach us?

1014
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:08,664
I teach you guys things.
Like expert choreography and stuff.

1015
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:10,791
No.

1016
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:14,545
We wanna give Monix
a chance to coach Coach.

1017
00:45:15,963 --> 00:45:18,549
What's goin' on here?

1018
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:21,218
What is this?

1019
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:24,555
Clarence?

1020
00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:28,976
This is a mutiny.

1021
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:33,355
You guys all in on this?

1022
00:45:37,109 --> 00:45:40,070
You motherfuckin' cocksuckers.

1023
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,281
All of you.

1024
00:45:43,157 --> 00:45:47,494
I have dedicated my life
to this team, OK?

1025
00:45:47,578 --> 00:45:49,913
I have given you guys my soul!

1026
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:54,835
I mean, who bought you
those boots last Halloween?

1027
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,337
It--That--That would be you Coach.
You bought us those boots.

1028
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,380
I bought 'em!

1029
00:45:58,464 --> 00:46:00,090
I really liked them boots.
They were nice.

1030
00:46:00,174 --> 00:46:02,301
They're really nice boots.

1031
00:46:02,384 --> 00:46:03,927
Yeah we love ya.

1032
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:07,097
But Monix just knows
the X's and O's baby. That's all.

1033
00:46:07,181 --> 00:46:08,140
Ohh--

1034
00:46:08,223 --> 00:46:11,059
Aw, come on, come on,
don't turn your back on us.

1035
00:46:11,143 --> 00:46:13,771
Hey hey hey hey hey. Listen.

1036
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:19,526
How about this I'll be the offensive
and defensive coordinator...

1037
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:22,654
and you can still be head coach.

1038
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:27,284
And you're the best promoter.
We gonna need fans right?

1039
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,120
Do you guys really think
I'm a good promoter?

1040
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:33,040
- Yeah yeah yeah.
- You know you are man.

1041
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:36,084
- I'm probably the best in the league.
- Yeah, that's what they say.

1042
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,503
- Top three.
- Yup.

1043
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:39,379
- Right up there.
- Yeah.

1044
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:41,256
OK.

1045
00:46:47,471 --> 00:46:48,430
There.

1046
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:52,351
Careful, don't blow too hard at first
'cause it'll give a high-pitched squeak.

1047
00:46:52,434 --> 00:46:54,561
You just wanna blow easy.

1048
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:57,231
And once she starts responding
then you can--you can let it fly.

1049
00:46:57,314 --> 00:46:58,816
Thanks Coach.

1050
00:47:03,821 --> 00:47:05,364
Uh--

1051
00:47:05,739 --> 00:47:08,659
All right let's practice guys!

1052
00:47:08,742 --> 00:47:08,783
If we play unselfish, fundamental
basketball we can make a run at this.

1053
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:13,956
If we play unselfish, fundamental
basketball we can make a run at this.

1054
00:47:14,706 --> 00:47:19,837
By unselfish I mean we sprint up
the court on every fast break...

1055
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,549
not because we might get a dunk and
get your dick sucked after the game...

1056
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:26,927
but because sprinting might pull
the defense out of position--

1057
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,304
Wait wait wait wait. So what's goin' on
with the blow jobs again?

1058
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:31,598
Yeah, 'cause I vote
we keep them blow jobs Jack.

1059
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:35,477
- Yeah. All in favor?
- Come on let the man talk.

1060
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,229
Thank you Clarence.

1061
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:40,524
Now till we start playing
like a real team...

1062
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:45,112
we're gonna practice without the ball.

1063
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,615
That's a waste.

1064
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:51,201
OK let's run the offense!

1065
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:55,205
- Without a ball?
- Yeah without the ball Clarence.

1066
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,708
Let's go everybody get in position.

1067
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:01,670
- Patch that ball up Scootsie.
- Come on! Hustle!

1068
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:03,755
OK Clarence flash through the lane.

1069
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,466
- Hustle Clarence!
- Come on come on.

1070
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,509
Ball ball ball!

1071
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:10,220
We been runnin'
the same play all day.

1072
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,347
Yeah can we maybe try
play number two?

1073
00:48:12,431 --> 00:48:15,642
No! I want you to be brain-dead
gentlemen!

1074
00:48:15,726 --> 00:48:19,688
'Cause someday you're gonna be
too tired or too nervous to think.

1075
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:23,150
And when you are,
this is the play that I'm gonna call.

1076
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,861
We need to be able to run
this play in our sleep.

1077
00:48:25,944 --> 00:48:28,488
I'm a rover, Coach.
I'm just gonna go rover.

1078
00:48:28,572 --> 00:48:31,116
No, don't just go rovin'.
Run the play Jackie Moon.

1079
00:48:31,199 --> 00:48:32,701
I'm creatin' a diversion though...

1080
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:35,495
- by runnin' in circles over here.
- Don't lose your mind Jackie Moon.

1081
00:48:35,579 --> 00:48:37,497
We are runnin' this until we puke.

1082
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:40,500
- Well basically we have.
- Yeah I'm pretty beat Coach.

1083
00:48:40,584 --> 00:48:42,836
"Until we puke"
is not a figure of speech.

1084
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,838
We are literally going to puke.

1085
00:48:44,922 --> 00:48:46,548
What does he mean by "literally"?

1086
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:53,055
I wish you were still
a washing machine!

1087
00:48:53,138 --> 00:48:56,683
Get up and run, Coach!
You're gonna puke like everybody else!

1088
00:48:56,767 --> 00:49:01,021
I can't puke, Monix!
I've never puked in my life ever!

1089
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,272
You're lying to me.

1090
00:49:02,356 --> 00:49:06,026
I've been sick before, I've just never
puked. Swear on my mother's grave.

1091
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:09,696
What about when you were a baby?
Babies throw up all the time.

1092
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:13,283
My mom said I never did it. I swear.

1093
00:49:14,534 --> 00:49:16,411
She said I was fascinating.

1094
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:20,874
In fact the local PBS wanted to do
a documentary on me.

1095
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:24,419
Have you ever been punched
in the jejunum?

1096
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,380
No what's a jejunum?

1097
00:49:26,463 --> 00:49:28,590
It's part of the small intestine.

1098
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,342
I don't think so.

1099
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:34,805
I mean I've been punched in the armpit
before, and in the wrist twice.

1100
00:49:35,597 --> 00:49:39,601
Coccyx and in the back of the knee.

1101
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:43,730
Both eyes and I've been punched
right in my--my tracheal--

1102
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:45,190
Unh!

1103
00:49:47,150 --> 00:49:48,735
Oh--

1104
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,153
Oh!

1105
00:49:51,488 --> 00:49:53,115
Hunh!

1106
00:49:53,198 --> 00:49:55,325
Ohh!

1107
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:56,743
Hunh--

1108
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:58,370
Ah ah.

1109
00:49:58,453 --> 00:49:59,997
Hunh--

1110
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,499
Hohh.

1111
00:50:02,582 --> 00:50:04,793
Let--Let that out.

1112
00:50:04,876 --> 00:50:05,961
Hohh.

1113
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:08,296
- Go ahead Jackie. Just let it go.
- Hhhoh!

1114
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,675
Hey hey hey.

1115
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,386
Hunh--

1116
00:50:14,469 --> 00:50:15,762
Hohh--urrrgh.

1117
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,473
Get ahold of yourself Ja--Jackie!

1118
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:22,310
Let go! Hold it in Jackie! Hold it in!

1119
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,396
Get off me God damn it!

1120
00:50:24,479 --> 00:50:25,772
- Jackie!
- Bleeuurgh!

1121
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,739
We are seeing a very different...

1122
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:35,323
Tropics basketball team
than we're used to...

1123
00:50:35,407 --> 00:50:36,616
aren't we Lou?

1124
00:50:36,700 --> 00:50:38,994
Playing with a lot of energy
and a lot of confidence.

1125
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:40,120
They're movin' the ball well.

1126
00:50:40,203 --> 00:50:41,163
It looks like they're gonna win this game.

1127
00:50:41,246 --> 00:50:43,373
- The only question is by how much?
- Mm.

1128
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,168
Jangel has the ball now.

1129
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,628
Oh my gosh a loose ball on the court
and Clarence dives for it?

1130
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:49,671
Timeout!

1131
00:50:49,755 --> 00:50:51,506
That's something we have not seen
before. And a timeout

1132
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:52,924
Timeout white!

1133
00:50:53,008 --> 00:50:55,385
- Hey. Good playin' out there Jackie.
- Thanks.

1134
00:50:55,469 --> 00:50:57,846
- Way to go man.
- Yeah.

1135
00:50:57,929 --> 00:51:00,474
The crowd is really excited tonight.

1136
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:01,808
They know what's at stake Dick.

1137
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:05,187
Yup gettin' their home team
into the NBA.

1138
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:06,646
No I'm talking about free corn dogs.

1139
00:51:06,730 --> 00:51:09,191
Oh that's right.
It's free corn dog night.

1140
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:10,734
Fellas it's lookin' great.

1141
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:12,527
We're 30 seconds away
from takin' this thing.

1142
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:16,823
Yeah he's right. Uh let's try to win
but not win by too much.

1143
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:19,659
- Wait we don't want to win by too much?
- Uh-uh.

1144
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:20,952
What the hell are you talkin' about?

1145
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:23,205
- Corn dogs.
- What?

1146
00:51:23,288 --> 00:51:24,831
See if we score 125 points...

1147
00:51:24,915 --> 00:51:27,334
that mean we gotta give everybody
in here a free corn dog, all right?

1148
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,628
Yeah, sorry, Monix.
We don't even got corn dogs.

1149
00:51:29,711 --> 00:51:32,047
Corn--I don't care,
we're takin' it to 'em all right?

1150
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,007
Hey we're up by seven OK?

1151
00:51:34,091 --> 00:51:36,802
Can't we just take it easy?
Run the clock out?

1152
00:51:36,885 --> 00:51:38,220
We're talkin' a lot of corn dogs!

1153
00:51:38,303 --> 00:51:39,846
I don't give a shit
about the corn dogs all right?

1154
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:44,017
We play hard every second. We run
the offense. Everybody got that?

1155
00:51:44,101 --> 00:51:45,685
- Right on.
- Yeah yeah yeah.

1156
00:51:45,769 --> 00:51:48,188
- You got that Jackie?
- Uh-huh.

1157
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:51,024
- OK bring us together man.
- One two three.

1158
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,735
Let's get Tropical!

1159
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:58,031
OK it looks like we are going
to return to the game. Monix--

1160
00:51:58,115 --> 00:51:59,241
- Hey Monix.
- ...has the ball.

1161
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:01,535
You wanna just throw it to me? I can
get it to Clarence. That might be easier.

1162
00:52:01,618 --> 00:52:02,953
Jackie move!

1163
00:52:03,036 --> 00:52:05,413
Ball ball ball ball
ball ball ball! Ball!

1164
00:52:05,497 --> 00:52:08,083
- Nice Monix!
- Monix inbounds to Clarence.

1165
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:10,001
OK. Come on Clarence
take your time.

1166
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:11,795
Come on Nets play some defense.

1167
00:52:12,921 --> 00:52:14,756
You wanna go for the double team?
Might be a good time.

1168
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,550
Double team double team.

1169
00:52:16,633 --> 00:52:18,677
I won't do anything
if I get the ball I promise.

1170
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:22,222
He'll go with his right. He loves
his right one. He likes the right hand.

1171
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:23,723
- What are you doin'?
- Clarence drives.

1172
00:52:23,807 --> 00:52:25,892
Dishes off to Scootsie.

1173
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:29,229
But look at this Jackie Moon
blocks his own teammate's shot!

1174
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,356
A loose ball on the court
Vakidis gets it.

1175
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:35,944
No-o-o-o-o!

1176
00:52:36,027 --> 00:52:39,072
Unh! Arrrrgh!

1177
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:55,589
God damn it Vakidis!

1178
00:52:55,672 --> 00:52:57,340
Learn fuckin' English!

1179
00:52:59,176 --> 00:53:03,388
Corn dogs, Jackie!
Corn dogs for all these people.

1180
00:53:03,471 --> 00:53:07,851
The Tropics win,
and this crowd is going crazy.

1181
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:10,103
Crazy for corn dogs.

1182
00:53:10,187 --> 00:53:14,900
And Jackie Moon gives us
a victory lap...right out the door!

1183
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:17,652
Now Scootsie rotate up top.

1184
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:21,072

Dance to the music

1196
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:54,856

00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:58,693

Here they come the Flint Tropics
Ball Girls cheerleading squad...

1209
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,824
keeping the crowd energized
through the timeout.

1210
00:54:45,907 --> 00:54:47,033
They've just got such big--

1211
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,952
- What?
- Hearts.

1212
00:54:49,035 --> 00:54:50,662
- Yes.
- Big bouncy jiggly hearts.

1213
00:54:50,745 --> 00:54:52,205
Well hearts don't really bounce...

1214
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:54,249
so now I think you're talking
about something else Lou.

1215
00:54:56,084 --> 00:54:58,169
- # Say it! Get up! #
- Yeah!

1216
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:00,088
Downtown brings
the ball up forward...

1217
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:02,382
and passes to Monix
at the top of the key.

1218
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:04,592
Behind his back to Doubleday.

1219
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:06,094
Scootsie goes for the three-pointer...

1220
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,804
and it is good!

1221
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:10,682
Are you actually havin' fun out here
Monix?

1222
00:55:10,765 --> 00:55:12,809
Hey don't tell anybody.

1223

Well if it isn't the toast of Flint Michigan.

1228
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:58,480
Shouldn't you be out signing
autographs somewhere or somethin'?

1229
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:05,445
- Will you marry me?
- Shut up.

1230
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:07,614
I'm--I'm crazy about you.
You know that.

1231
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:09,032
Do I?

1232
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:11,409
You came to one of our games.

1233
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:14,245
Don't think I didn't see you
hiding in the upper deck.

1234
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:18,958
- So?
- So--So let's do this Lynn. You and me.

1235
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:22,670
You know uh like back in the day.

1236
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:27,217
You know? I--I mean not then because
I was an asshole. Better right?

1237
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:29,177
For real this time.

1238
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,432
I need you.

1239
00:56:35,141 --> 00:56:37,185
Yo Monix!

1240
00:56:37,268 --> 00:56:42,357
What's up, man?
Hey check out the jersey. Ha ha. I'm you!

1241
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,693
- Yeah. Ha ha ha.

1242
00:56:45,777 --> 00:56:48,321
- Hey Kyle?
- Yeah.

1243
00:56:48,405 --> 00:56:50,156
Can you do me a big favor?

1244
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:53,159
Can you go get me a tube of Bengay?

1245
00:56:53,243 --> 00:56:58,164
Are you kidding me?
I'd be honored man. I'll leave right now.

1246
00:56:58,248 --> 00:56:59,249
What do you think you're doing?

1247
00:56:59,332 --> 00:57:00,458
- Hey Kyle?
- Yeah!

1248
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:03,002
Listen don't--Kyle?

1249
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:04,838
- Yeah!
- Don't go to the pharmacy.

1250
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:08,425
I need one of those big tubes like
you get at--at Luger's out on Route 59.

1251
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:10,885
I'm already gone big man!

1252
00:57:15,932 --> 00:57:19,060
Hey Lynn. Forgot my stupid wallet.

1253
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,770
- Uh!

1254
00:57:22,939 --> 00:57:24,524
Uh! Uh!

1255
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,317
That's it.

1256
00:57:34,451 --> 00:57:36,369
Yes.

1257
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,663
# Oh baby keep on #

# You got it together #

# Baby keep on #

1263
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:56,055
# Oh you got it together baby #

1264
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:58,266
# Right on #

1265
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,476
# Keep on doin' it #

1266
00:57:59,559 --> 00:58:02,479
# And I'll give you
baby all that I get #

1267
00:58:03,897 --> 00:58:05,690
- Kyle.
- # Keep on #

1268
00:58:05,773 --> 00:58:07,609
Oh!

1269
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:10,570
- Fuck!
- Heh heh Monix!

1270
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:11,946
You old dog.

1271
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:13,865
- What the hell are you doin'?
- Nothin' , man.

1272
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:17,118
I'm just sittin' here watching...
and stuff.

1273
00:58:17,202 --> 00:58:18,495
I'm outta here.

1274
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:22,040
Come on man don't be like that.
It's all cool.

1275
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:25,835
No man. No believe me it's not cool.

1276
00:58:25,919 --> 00:58:27,587
I'll call you.

1277
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,297
OK.

1278
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,219
He was talkin' to me.

1279
00:58:34,969 --> 00:58:36,137
Yes ladies and gentlemen...

1280
00:58:36,221 --> 00:58:38,806
Jackie Moon has outdone himself
with this promotion...

1281
00:58:38,890 --> 00:58:42,602
as he prepares to jump
over 47 feet of Ball Girls.

1282
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:45,480
- # Rollercoaster #
- # Say, what? #

1283
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:46,523
Ooh.

1284
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:49,150
The fact that Jackie's
never been on roller skates before...

1285
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:50,985
appears to have done nothing
to diminish his confidence.

1286
00:58:51,069 --> 00:58:53,905
- # Rollercoaster #
- All right folks.

1287
00:58:53,988 --> 00:58:55,240
Here comes--

1288
00:58:55,323 --> 00:58:58,493
- # Rollercoaster #
- ...Jackie!

1289
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:01,204
Here he comes down the ramp.

1290
00:59:01,287 --> 00:59:03,665
- He is airborne!
- Ah, shit!

1291
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:04,624
Ahh!

1292
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:07,669
- Oh, no!
- Oh Lord!

1293
00:59:10,797 --> 00:59:12,840
- Jackie's up!
Rollercoaster!

1294
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:15,093
Of love

1295
00:59:15,176 --> 00:59:16,594
- Great job!
- # Rollercoaster! #

1296
00:59:16,678 --> 00:59:18,763
And everyone survives!

1297
00:59:18,846 --> 00:59:20,723
That was exciting!

1298
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:24,143
- # Of love #
- Oh that's an adrenaline rush.

1299
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:25,311
Rollercoaster

1300
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:28,856
Next time I'm gonna jump
even more girls. Whew.

1301
00:59:29,899 --> 00:59:33,278
- What?
- The Commissioner just called again.

1302
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:36,197
- Commish?
- He's drivin' up here on Monday.

1303
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:38,616
- He's comin' to Flint?
- Yes he's comin' to Flint.

1304
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,202
Shit. Crap.

1305
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:46,040
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1306
00:59:46,124 --> 00:59:49,294
You know Jackie we need
2000 fans in those stands.

1307
00:59:49,377 --> 00:59:52,171
We can't fake it this time.
We gotta--we gotta do somethin'.

1308
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:53,756
Look it's no problem.
I'll take care of it.

1309
00:59:53,840 --> 00:59:56,050
Yeah? We've tried everything.

1310
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,635
Look I said I'll handle it OK?

1311
00:59:57,719 --> 01:00:00,346
- I'll think of somethin'.
- All right.

1312
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:02,098
Back in 30 seconds.

1313
01:00:02,181 --> 01:00:04,892
- How's your wife doin'?
- Oh she's doing just super.

1314
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:06,227
- She's gorgeous. Yeah.
- Really terri--

1315
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,479
- Oh thank you I think. Ha ha. I mean--

1316
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:11,024
- ...hands off! Ha ha ha.
- Ha ha ha. I'll try.

1317
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:12,233
- OK.
- No guarantees.

1318
01:00:12,317 --> 01:00:13,818
- Really?
- Ha ha ha.

1319
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:15,528
I'd like a guarantee. Ha ha.

1320
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:17,030
Are we back Chuck?
We're back.

1321
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:19,532
OK. Welcome back
to Tropics Weekly.

1322
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:22,493

1323
01:00:22,577 --> 01:00:24,829

when you can drop by.

1324
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:26,372

Dick Pepper.

1325
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:28,499
Ha ha ha. Dick Pepperfield actually.

1326
01:00:28,583 --> 01:00:29,542
Now Jackie...

1327
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:33,880
amazingly, you're two wins away
from getting your team to the NBA.

1328
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:37,717
How do you intend to match up
to the Squires' strong inside game?

1329
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:39,218
It's a great question.

1330
01:00:39,302 --> 01:00:44,349
Tomorrow after the game
I Jackie Moon will wrestle a bear.

1331
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:47,101
Uh well that's something...

1332
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,646
but uh defensively as a team
how do you--

1333
01:00:49,729 --> 01:00:51,606
That's tomorrow night
one night only...

1334
01:00:51,689 --> 01:00:54,275
watch Dewie the Wrestling Bear
attack me--

1335
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:56,402
and he's killed people in public before.

1336
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,029
Well OK that is some entertainment...

1337
01:00:58,112 --> 01:01:00,698
and you are known for
your creative promotions Jackie but--

1338
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:02,367
You're not gonna
want to miss this folks...

1339
01:01:02,450 --> 01:01:05,078
and if you're a small child you creep
into your mama's bedroom at night...

1340
01:01:05,161 --> 01:01:06,954
and you lift about 40 bucks...

1341
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:08,247
- outta your mom's purse--
- Oh, no, no, no.

1342
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:11,751
...and you walk down to Flint
Fairgrounds Coliseum eight o'clock!

1343
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:14,921
There ya have it. Jackie Moon
thanks so much for joining us.

1344
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:17,465

1345
01:01:20,134 --> 01:01:24,472
I'm Dick Pepperfield reminding you
there will be another night.

1346
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:26,599
Good night Flint.

1347
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,726

1348
01:01:28,810 --> 01:01:33,439

We are gonna get some pussy aren't we?

1353
01:01:45,243 --> 01:01:47,036
- Ha ha ha.
- It's gonna be fun.

1354
01:01:49,163 --> 01:01:51,582
Come on!

1355
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:53,418
I'm scared Clarence.

1356
01:01:54,544 --> 01:01:57,463
It's a baby bear.
It's trained and everything.

1357
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,465
Who's a good bear?

1358
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:01,134
Who used to live in the woods?

1359
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:04,804
I don't care. I'm terrified of those things.
I'm freakin' out.

1360
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:06,305
Come on get it together.

1361
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:09,225
Oh oh I'm startin' to feel really dizzy.

1362
01:02:09,308 --> 01:02:10,560
Break his neck! Come on!

1363
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:12,812
- Call it off?
- No! No.

1364
01:02:12,895 --> 01:02:15,356
OK. I gotta give these people a show.

1365
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:17,650
- Are you guys ready?
- Uh-huh.

1366
01:02:17,734 --> 01:02:20,486
- You have to give me your safe word.
- No I don't need a safe word.

1367
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:24,991
OK, I'll tell you what, if you feel
like you're in danger just say, um--

1368
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:27,410
...spumoni.

1369
01:02:27,493 --> 01:02:30,163
No I--I don't need spumoni OK?
Let's get this show on the road.

1370
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:32,665
Bobby Dee.

1371
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:40,673
- Let's go!
- Go--Go--Go ahead man.

1372
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:45,428
What are you afraid of?

1373
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:47,638
Hey.

1374
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:51,434
We're both wearing red.

1375
01:02:51,517 --> 01:02:54,687
- Sorry I'm not ignoring you. I'm just--
- That's stupid Jackie!

1376
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:57,273
- ...trying to deal with him right now.
- Oh.

1377
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,276
I like your top hat though.

1378
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:04,030
Thanks. It was normal size
but I put it in the dryer.

1379
01:03:04,113 --> 01:03:05,573
How long you been
working with the bear?

1380
01:03:05,656 --> 01:03:07,617
Um just like a day or so.

1381
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,035
What?

1382
01:03:09,118 --> 01:03:11,913
But I've been working with cats
for like 12 years.

1383
01:03:11,996 --> 01:03:14,832
So I'm very familiar with animals.

1384
01:03:14,916 --> 01:03:16,834
Great.

1385
01:03:16,918 --> 01:03:18,544
- C'mon!
- Hey, Dewie.

1386
01:03:18,628 --> 01:03:21,047
Fuck that shit!

1387
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:25,301
I'm outta here. Spumoni.

1388
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:28,513
No nope. No no.
You can't quit now. We just started.

1389
01:03:30,348 --> 01:03:32,058
We got to give these people
a show, man.

1390
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:33,518
- Yeah you're right.
- That guy's a pussy!

1391
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:37,063
Test him out.
I'm just gonna be right over here.

1392
01:03:38,022 --> 01:03:39,941
- Do something!
- Come on, Dewie.

1393
01:03:40,024 --> 01:03:41,943
You're just nothin' but a dumb bear.

1394
01:03:42,026 --> 01:03:44,320
Smack smack. Yep. Whoo.

1395
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:49,242
Crazy fists. I'm comin' with crazy fists.

1396
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:51,285
Huh?

1397
01:03:51,369 --> 01:03:53,871
Yeah. Huh? This is fine
he's not doing anything.

1398
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:01,003
Flint can you dig it?

1399
01:04:01,087 --> 01:04:02,129
Jackie Moon Flint--

1400
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:03,881
- Aaargh!
- Shit!

1401
01:04:03,965 --> 01:04:05,174
Oh! Oh!

1402
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:08,094
Aaargh! Aaargh!

1403
01:04:08,177 --> 01:04:10,137
Aah! Aaaargh!

1404
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:12,598
- Dewie!
- Aargh!

1405
01:04:12,682 --> 01:04:13,683
Spumoni!

1406
01:04:13,766 --> 01:04:15,643
One round. No spumoni!

1407
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:17,520
Fuck you Clarence! Spumoni!

1408
01:04:17,603 --> 01:04:20,106
- Dewie no!
- Aarrrgh!

1409
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:22,859
Bobby Dee help! Shit! Spumoni!

1410
01:04:32,159 --> 01:04:35,246
Watch my hair! Watch my hair!

1411
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:38,124
The only thing I care about
is my hair! Watch it!

1412
01:04:38,207 --> 01:04:41,544
Aaargh! Dewie! My hair! Oh!

1413
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:44,463
Spumoni! Spumoni!

1414
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:48,301
How many times
do I gotta say spumoni?

1415
01:04:48,384 --> 01:04:51,137
- Somebody's got to do something.
- I wouldn't go in there if I were you.

1416
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:53,764
Don't worry Jackie!
I'm coming Jackie.

1417
01:04:53,848 --> 01:04:55,474
I'm comin' Jackie.

1418
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,351
Aaargh!

1419
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,108
Turn on the lights! Turn on the lights!

1420
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,612
Good. Shh.

1421
01:05:07,695 --> 01:05:11,365
Nobody move. Nobody move.

1422
01:05:12,408 --> 01:05:15,494
Where are you precious?

1423
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:18,164
Dewie?

1424
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:21,167
Everyone just remain seated.

1425
01:05:21,250 --> 01:05:23,419
I think he left.

1426
01:05:23,502 --> 01:05:24,462
Dewie?

1427
01:05:26,130 --> 01:05:27,590
Aaah!

1428
01:05:27,673 --> 01:05:29,508
Everybody panic!

1429
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:33,554
Oh my God there's a bear
loose in the Coliseum!

1430
01:05:33,638 --> 01:05:35,723
There will be no refunds!

1431
01:05:35,806 --> 01:05:38,851
Your refund will be escaping
this deathtrap with your life!

1432
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:41,479
If you have a small child
use it as a shield!

1433
01:05:41,562 --> 01:05:43,189
They love the tender meat.

1434
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:46,692
Cover your sodas Dewie loves sugar.

1435
01:05:48,277 --> 01:05:52,156
- Hey, Jackie.
- Hey Commish.

1436
01:05:53,282 --> 01:05:54,909
What do ya think?
Packed house right?

1437
01:05:54,992 --> 01:05:57,662
I need to speak with you
and the rest of the team Jackie.

1438
01:05:57,745 --> 01:06:00,998
OK. Locker room? All right.

1439
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:01,247
This whole merger thing
has been really complicated.

1440
01:06:01,248 --> 01:06:04,669
This whole merger thing
has been really complicated.

1441
01:06:04,752 --> 01:06:09,215
It's taken a lot of my time
out of my life away from my family.

1442
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:15,805
Look even if you beat the Spurs
on Saturday--

1443
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:18,766
...the Tropics won't be going
to the NBA next year.

1444
01:06:18,849 --> 01:06:20,643
Come on man.

1445
01:06:20,726 --> 01:06:22,269
What--What the hell
are you talkin' about?

1446
01:06:22,353 --> 01:06:26,107
The expansion committee had
an emergency meeting in Manhattan.

1447
01:06:26,190 --> 01:06:30,611
and they decided that Flint
just isn't a big enough media market.

1448
01:06:30,695 --> 01:06:33,322
Well tough shit!
We done made it this far.

1449
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:34,907
- Mm-hm.
- And rules is rules.

1450
01:06:34,991 --> 01:06:37,827
Guys it's over.

1451
01:06:37,910 --> 01:06:39,912
There's nothing I can do.

1452
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:46,711
Jackie, I'm man enough
to admit when I'm wrong.

1453
01:06:47,712 --> 01:06:51,173
I never thought you'd pull it off.
But you did.

1454
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:55,428
Good luck.

1455
01:06:56,178 --> 01:06:57,596
Psh! Right.

1456
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:02,560
Jackie this is the type of deal
you can work around, ain't it?

1457
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:06,814
Yeah, you Jackie Moon. I mean,
you can just make a phone call right?

1458
01:07:06,897 --> 01:07:08,315
Uh-huh.

1459
01:07:09,400 --> 01:07:12,361
Ah sorry guys. I--I let you down.

1460
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:15,406
I'm nothin' but a big phony.

1461
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:16,449
Mm-mm.

1462
01:07:16,532 --> 01:07:18,743
Oh man don't talk like that.
You ain't no phony.

1463
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:23,706
Yes I am. You know my song
Love Me Sexy?

1464
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:24,874
Of course yeah.

1465
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:27,668
Yeah everybody loves that song man.
It was number one in the country.

1466
01:07:27,752 --> 01:07:29,045
I stole it.

1467
01:07:29,128 --> 01:07:31,005
No.

1468
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:32,840
It's true.

1469
01:07:32,923 --> 01:07:37,178
My mom wrote it on a napkin three weeks
before she died and I stole it.

1470
01:07:37,803 --> 01:07:39,638
That song bought me this franchise...

1471
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:42,016
and the hottest wife in the world...

1472
01:07:42,099 --> 01:07:45,352
but it's all fake.

1473
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:50,649
Well--Well look you can write another
song. I know it's in your bones. Right?

1474
01:07:50,733 --> 01:07:54,070
Don't be crazy. I can't write a song
as brilliant as Love Me Sexy.

1475
01:07:54,153 --> 01:07:56,072
You're right.

1476
01:07:56,155 --> 01:07:58,491
I just wish I could puke this all away.

1477
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:03,704
Monix can you punch me
in the jejunum?

1478
01:08:05,206 --> 01:08:06,540
Monix?

1479
01:08:07,833 --> 01:08:14,006
# Qué será será #

1480
01:08:14,090 --> 01:08:15,674
In a new merger-policy shift...

1481
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:19,929
it seems the Tropics will not
be playing for an NBA berth after all.

1482
01:08:20,012 --> 01:08:22,473
Saturday's matchup
against the first-place Spurs...

1483
01:08:22,556 --> 01:08:25,684
will be the Tropics'
final basketball game.

1484
01:08:25,768 --> 01:08:27,853
And in an act of great sacrifice...

1485
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:30,564
Jackie Moon has helped
Tropics' superstar Coffee Black...

1486
01:08:30,648 --> 01:08:32,399
realize his NBA dreams...

1487
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:33,484
by trading him to the Spurs.

1488
01:08:33,567 --> 01:08:38,239
Clarence baby you made it! You made it
Clarence you made it! Ha ha ha!

1489
01:08:38,322 --> 01:08:40,699
Yes. Uh-huh!

1490
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:44,787
# Qué será #

1491
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:48,124
# Qué será #

1492
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:50,793
Bullshit.

1493
01:08:54,338 --> 01:08:56,048
# Qué será #

1494
01:08:58,050 --> 01:09:03,597
For Lou Redwood I'm Dick Pepperfield
reminding you there will be another--

1495
01:09:03,681 --> 01:09:07,309
No actually we're down to our last night.

1496
01:09:07,393 --> 01:09:09,812
Ah shit.

1497
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:20,406
Sup chief?

1498
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:22,158
Hey.

1499
01:09:28,205 --> 01:09:29,874
What are you doing here?

1500
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:34,503
If you ain't heard I got traded.

1501
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:36,213
Oh yeah.

1502
01:09:36,297 --> 01:09:38,674
Coffee Black headin' to the NBA.

1503
01:09:39,758 --> 01:09:41,886
Big time.

1504
01:09:41,969 --> 01:09:45,097
Yeah I just wanted to let you know
man, this year, you coaching us...

1505
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:46,390
the way you did it,
you really made us feel--

1506
01:09:46,473 --> 01:09:49,101
No no no no. Ha ha.

1507
01:09:49,185 --> 01:09:50,436
Don't.

1508
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:52,354
OK.

1509
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:59,028
Let me ask you somethin' Monix.

1510
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:00,696
Yup.

1511
01:10:00,779 --> 01:10:02,448
You already played for the NBA.

1512
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:05,993
Your knee is gone...

1513
01:10:06,076 --> 01:10:09,622
you couldn't give a damn about the
merger you were gonna retire anyway.

1514
01:10:09,705 --> 01:10:12,041
What's the question?

1515
01:10:12,124 --> 01:10:14,835
What--what you playin' for?

1516
01:10:19,673 --> 01:10:22,259
I just wanna sit here
and have a beer in peace.

1517
01:10:22,343 --> 01:10:23,636
Yeah?

1518
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:30,559
All right.

1519
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:35,105
I just thought you'd wanna hear that.

1520
01:10:35,189 --> 01:10:36,941
Have a good one.

1521
01:10:49,912 --> 01:10:52,830
# Baby are you ready
to lick me sexy? Oh! #

1522
01:10:52,831 --> 01:10:54,541
# Baby are you ready
to lick me sexy? Oh! #

1523
01:10:54,625 --> 01:10:55,584
Jackie where you at?

1524
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:59,922
# I'm a big faker
and I stole this song-ly sexy #

1525
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:04,718
# I wanna kill myself-y sexy #

1526
01:11:04,802 --> 01:11:06,345
Uh-huh.

1527
01:11:06,428 --> 01:11:11,976
# I'm gonna get an extension
cord and hang myself sexy #

1528
01:11:12,059 --> 01:11:14,937
Oh buddy. What are you doin'?

1529
01:11:16,063 --> 01:11:19,650
Oh right now I'm urinating on myself.

1530
01:11:21,568 --> 01:11:25,447
Listen Jackie I never thanked you.

1531
01:11:25,531 --> 01:11:28,951
- For what?
- For helpin' me find basketball again.

1532
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:32,579
Oh.

1533
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:36,375
Now what is it--Don't eat that.

1534
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:39,128
- What is that?
- Pancake.

1535
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:42,798
- Has that been there?
- It's been here a while.

1536
01:11:42,881 --> 01:11:46,844
Listen Jackie I think
you should call a team meeting.

1537
01:11:46,927 --> 01:11:48,387
Why?

1538
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:52,182
'Cause you're still the leader
of the Tropics. Can you do that?

1539
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:58,689
- OK.
- Ah.

1540
01:11:58,772 --> 01:12:00,065
You're a good man.

1541
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:02,985
Should we uh--

1542
01:12:03,068 --> 01:12:05,738
I hate to see this go to waste.
This little bit.

1543
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:09,825
It won't go to waste.
Save that for the next guy.

1544
01:12:10,993 --> 01:12:12,077
Ohhh.

1545
01:12:12,161 --> 01:12:13,454
Ooh.

1546
01:12:13,537 --> 01:12:14,621
Come on big guy.

1547
01:12:14,705 --> 01:12:17,750
I just live in a world of
urine and pancakes you know?

1548
01:12:17,833 --> 01:12:19,835
- Kinda smells that way.
- Yeah.

1549
01:12:20,502 --> 01:12:24,006
- You smell good.
- Thank you.

1550
01:12:25,674 --> 01:12:27,509
- Watch when you roll over.
- OK.

1551
01:12:27,593 --> 01:12:29,553
Watch. OK here we go.

1552
01:12:29,636 --> 01:12:31,347
- Oh my God.
- Oh ho.

1553
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:34,683
OK.

1554
01:12:36,477 --> 01:12:38,354
If I could have
everyone's attention please.

1555
01:12:38,437 --> 01:12:40,439
Uh well...

1556
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:44,276
I just wanted to take one last time
to say thank you to all of you...

1557
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:49,031
for all your hard work
as part of the Flint Tropics.

1558
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:55,829
My teammates it was an honor
to be on the court with you.

1559
01:12:55,913 --> 01:12:57,956
You guys are the best.

1560
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:03,087
Even you, Vakidis.
Goddamn dumb son of a bitch.

1561
01:13:03,796 --> 01:13:06,423
You don't understand
a word I'm saying do you?

1562
01:13:07,341 --> 01:13:10,427
To the Tropic Ball Girls...

1563
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:12,137
I always thought I was gonna sleep
with a couple of you...

1564
01:13:12,221 --> 01:13:14,807
but ha ha that--that didn't happen.

1565
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:19,436
That'll teach me to procrastinate.

1566
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:24,066
Bobby Dee,
you're like a son I never had.

1567
01:13:24,983 --> 01:13:29,113
The son who's exactly
the same age as me.

1568
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:32,533
Well kinda--You're like
a half-son half-friend.

1569
01:13:32,616 --> 01:13:34,952
Friend. A son-friend.

1570
01:13:35,035 --> 01:13:40,582
No don't talk. You'll just make it worse.
I don't want to cry and wet my pants.

1571
01:13:42,793 --> 01:13:44,837
I'm not makin'
a whole lot of sense right now.

1572
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,797
Um--

1573
01:13:46,880 --> 01:13:48,632
Hunh--

1574
01:13:48,715 --> 01:13:49,758
- Jackie?
- Yeah?

1575
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:52,428
- Can I say a couple words?
- Please.

1576
01:13:52,511 --> 01:13:54,513
Thanks.

1577
01:13:58,225 --> 01:14:02,020
So we all know
that Clarence got traded...

1578
01:14:02,104 --> 01:14:06,024
and we all know this game
doesn't really matter anymore right?

1579
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:07,985
I've been thinking...

1580
01:14:09,361 --> 01:14:12,156
We made it our mission
to win fourth place.

1581
01:14:14,158 --> 01:14:18,829
You know fourth place is still out there
waiting for us to take it.

1582
01:14:20,289 --> 01:14:22,124
And we're this close.

1583
01:14:22,916 --> 01:14:28,130
Now I--I tried to--to pretend that
it didn't matter if we won fourth or not.

1584
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:31,175
The truth is...

1585
01:14:34,803 --> 01:14:39,641
I never wanted anything
more in my whole fucked-up life.

1586
01:14:40,517 --> 01:14:42,561
This game does matter.

1587
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:43,562
It matters...

1588
01:14:43,645 --> 01:14:49,193
because this is the last real game of
basketball any of us is ever gonna play.

1589
01:14:49,276 --> 01:14:50,986
Ever.

1590
01:14:52,154 --> 01:14:56,283
Saturday night I say we leave it
all out there on the floor...

1591
01:14:56,366 --> 01:14:59,828
because there is nothing else
for us to save it for.

1592
01:15:01,455 --> 01:15:06,001
Clarence or no Clarence
NBA or no NBA...

1593
01:15:08,545 --> 01:15:10,339
this is for us.

1594
01:15:16,428 --> 01:15:18,430
Yeah. Let's do this.

1595
01:15:19,056 --> 01:15:21,934
Jackie Moon I believe you have
one more game to promote.

1596
01:15:22,017 --> 01:15:24,394
- That's right.
- Damn right.

1597
01:15:24,478 --> 01:15:27,022
- Huh? Gentlemen?
- Let's bring it in.

1598
01:15:27,105 --> 01:15:28,607
- Ladies?
- C'mon.

1599
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:31,818
- Yeah.
- Let's go Tropics.

1600
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:34,571
- Let me hear you say "Fourth place! "
- Fourth place!

1601
01:15:34,655 --> 01:15:36,573
- Fourth place!
- Fourth place!

1602
01:15:36,907 --> 01:15:38,534
- Fourth place!
- Fourth place!

1603
01:15:38,867 --> 01:15:40,744
- Fourth place!
- Fourth place!

1604
01:15:40,827 --> 01:15:40,910
Look, the Spurs may be
the number-one team in the league...

1605
01:15:40,911 --> 01:15:43,664
Look, the Spurs may be
the number-one team in the league...

1606
01:15:43,747 --> 01:15:47,251
but come Saturday night
they're gonna have to prove it.

1607
01:15:47,334 --> 01:15:48,752
Turtleneck.

1608
01:15:48,835 --> 01:15:52,631
Mr. Moon since this game
doesn't actually count...

1609
01:15:52,714 --> 01:15:54,299
what exactly is your motivation?

1610
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:59,596
On Saturday we're gonna be playing
for the Flint, Michigan Megabowl.

1611
01:15:59,680 --> 01:16:01,139
White pants.

1612
01:16:01,223 --> 01:16:03,517
Yeah I don't know if I understand
what you mean by Megabowl?

1613
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:05,769
It's a Megabowl.
What's not to understand?

1614
01:16:05,852 --> 01:16:06,853
This is history in the making.

1615
01:16:06,937 --> 01:16:11,733
You're gonna wanna tell your grandkids
and their grandkids and their grandkids.

1616
01:16:11,817 --> 01:16:14,278
And when they look back
in the "anals" of history...

1617
01:16:14,361 --> 01:16:16,321
they're gonna be talkin'
about three things...

1618
01:16:16,405 --> 01:16:19,866
discovery of fire,
invention of the submarine...

1619
01:16:19,950 --> 01:16:21,410
and the Flint Michigan Megabowl.

1620
01:16:21,493 --> 01:16:23,245
Right but still the game doesn't count.

1621
01:16:23,328 --> 01:16:28,000
The trophy's 12 feet high.
And it is glorious. I've seen it.

1622
01:16:28,083 --> 01:16:30,168
Oh yeah and--and when
we win the game...

1623
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:31,962
uh that big gun's gonna shoot off.

1624
01:16:32,045 --> 01:16:34,631
The cannon doesn't actually fire.
It's a relic.

1625
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:36,174
We're gonna win the Megabowl.

1626
01:16:36,258 --> 01:16:38,885
Saturday! Eight o'clock!

1627
01:16:38,969 --> 01:16:40,762
Flint Michigan Megabowl!

1628
01:16:40,846 --> 01:16:44,891
Flint Michigan Megabowl!
Flint Michigan Megabowl!

1629
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:46,727
Fourth place! Fourth place!

1630
01:16:46,810 --> 01:16:48,729
The Tropics seem to have captured
every heart...

1631
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:50,355
in this town of underdogs.

1632
01:16:50,439 --> 01:16:52,065
People have poured in
from around the state...

1633
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:55,944
to root for this first Megabowl
championship.

1634
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:57,904
- Fourth place! Fourth place!
- It's a wonderful night for Flint...

1635
01:16:57,988 --> 01:17:00,699
and a wonderful night
for the Flint Fairgrounds Coliseum.

1636
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:05,203
Now Flint will be playing
without Coffee Black their top scorer...

1637
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:11,209
as the Spurs have traded for several
new players from around the ABA.

1638
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:15,756
I was excited to be here
till I saw your face Coffee.

1639
01:17:27,225 --> 01:17:30,937
Why's it so quiet in here?
Somebody say somethin'!

1640
01:17:32,397 --> 01:17:34,524
Monix what time is it?

1641
01:17:35,901 --> 01:17:36,902
It's time.

1642
01:17:48,163 --> 01:17:53,251
It is a sold-out crowd here
at the Flint Fairgrounds Coliseum

1643
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:56,088
as the Tropics walk onto the court.

1644
01:17:56,171 --> 01:17:58,840
I tell you what, Dick,
this makes a lot of sense...

1645
01:17:58,924 --> 01:18:02,260
this heroes' welcome
for this Flint Tropics team.

1646
01:18:02,344 --> 01:18:03,929
This is extraordinary.

1647
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:06,765
Jackie Moon
is Flint's favorite son...

1648
01:18:06,848 --> 01:18:09,518
and he has done more for this city...

1649
01:18:09,601 --> 01:18:12,896
than any human being
who's ever lived on this planet!

1650
01:18:12,979 --> 01:18:17,526
With the possible exception
of, uh, Henry Ford...

1651
01:18:17,609 --> 01:18:20,946
Jackie Moon has done a lot for this city
you're right about that.

1652
01:18:32,874 --> 01:18:35,627
Good tip to the Spurs.
Behind the back.

1653
01:18:35,711 --> 01:18:38,004
And wow! A little "How do you do?"
from Markie.

1654
01:18:38,088 --> 01:18:40,298
That's a pretty impressive start
for the Spurs.

1655
01:18:40,382 --> 01:18:43,218
Running roughshod over the Tropics.

1656
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:48,390
Vakidis passes to Doubleday.

1657
01:18:48,473 --> 01:18:50,058
Oh! Rejected.

1658
01:18:51,017 --> 01:18:52,686
Scootsie passes to Jackie.

1659
01:18:52,769 --> 01:18:54,479
Out to Twiggy and--

1660
01:18:54,563 --> 01:18:56,523
Oh stolen by Rebenkoff.

1661
01:18:56,606 --> 01:18:57,649
He pulls up for a dagger...

1662
01:18:57,733 --> 01:18:59,609
and ouch three points.

1663
01:18:59,693 --> 01:19:01,445
Yeah!

1664
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:05,991
Yeah I don't feel good about this.
I may not have brought enough Scotch.

1665
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:08,702
Oh shit!

1666
01:19:08,785 --> 01:19:10,328
Oh!

1667
01:19:10,412 --> 01:19:13,498
It's hard to say where the Tropics
are falling down worse tonight...

1668
01:19:13,582 --> 01:19:15,333
on defense or on offense.

1669
01:19:15,417 --> 01:19:18,795
And with Coffee Black on
the Spurs bench the Tropics look lost.

1670
01:19:18,879 --> 01:19:20,672
You're goin' in Coffee Black.

1671
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:23,633
Coach I've got back spasms.
I--I can't do it.

1672
01:19:24,426 --> 01:19:26,678
Lutz you're in.

1673
01:19:30,223 --> 01:19:31,516
Jackie! C'mon. Jackie Jackie!

1674
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,226
Moon to Ellis.

1675
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:34,478
Ellis to Munson.

1676
01:19:34,561 --> 01:19:36,772
Munson to Monix.

1677
01:19:36,855 --> 01:19:39,524
Ooh three points! Monix responds!

1678
01:19:39,608 --> 01:19:41,443
But it will take more than
one fancy three...

1679
01:19:41,526 --> 01:19:43,653
to defeat these mighty Spurs.

1680
01:19:46,156 --> 01:19:49,576
This is easily the worst half
of basketball the Tropics have played...

1681
01:19:49,659 --> 01:19:51,369
since Monix took over as coach.

1682
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:55,081
- Yeah it's a shit-fuckin'-sandwich Dick.
- Oh, let's watch the F-bomb, Lou.

1683
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:56,666
With time expiring in the first half...

1684
01:19:56,750 --> 01:19:59,586
Monix splits the screen
with a pass to Moon.

1685
01:19:59,669 --> 01:20:00,796
He goes up strong--

1686
01:20:00,879 --> 01:20:02,547
Oh! Gets taken out by Petrelli.

1687
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:05,884
I don't think I've ever seen anyone
get taken out quite that hard before.

1688
01:20:05,967 --> 01:20:08,720
This looks serious.

1689
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:10,931
Monix you gotta hit him in the nuts!

1690
01:20:11,014 --> 01:20:13,850
Father Pat breaking up what
could have been total pandemonium.

1691
01:20:13,934 --> 01:20:16,812
- Come on.
- Jackie? Jackie.

1692
01:20:16,895 --> 01:20:19,731
- Come on back to the bench.
- Jackie? Oh.

1693
01:20:19,815 --> 01:20:21,358
He's got a pulse.

1694
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:24,277
Let's get the stretcher.

1695
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:27,155
- We don't have a stretcher.
- Jackie sold it.

1696
01:20:27,239 --> 01:20:28,865
- All right well let's get him up.
- Yeah come on.

1697
01:20:28,949 --> 01:20:30,283
Let's get him in the locker room
guys. Hurry.

1698
01:20:30,367 --> 01:20:31,535
Come on come on.

1699
01:20:31,618 --> 01:20:35,413
Jackie's teammates doing just
an awful job of stabilizing his spine...

1700
01:20:35,497 --> 01:20:37,290
as they carry him off the court.

1701
01:20:37,374 --> 01:20:39,543
Come on Jackie.

1702
01:21:02,107 --> 01:21:03,066
Yeah!

1703
01:21:03,149 --> 01:21:04,150
Where the hell
do you think you're goin'?

1704
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:05,527
--Coffee!

1705
01:21:05,610 --> 01:21:08,196
You walk away from this team
you will never play in the NBA.

1706
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,198
That's my son! That's my son!

1707
01:21:10,282 --> 01:21:12,826
- Go Clarence! Go Clarence!
- You hear me Coffee?

1708
01:21:12,909 --> 01:21:16,246
Look at this. Coffee Black
is walking over to the Tropics.

1709
01:21:16,329 --> 01:21:19,124
This crowd is going crazy!

1710
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:23,460
Come on Jackie wake up.

1711
01:21:23,461 --> 01:21:25,547
Come on Jackie wake up.

1712
01:21:25,630 --> 01:21:27,799
Jackie come on
it's me it's Bobby Dee.

1713
01:21:27,883 --> 01:21:29,885
Wake up. Come on open 'em up.

1714
01:21:29,968 --> 01:21:32,971
- Hey you got any smelling salt?
- I think we do.

1715
01:21:33,972 --> 01:21:35,599
- Get up.
- Jackie.

1716
01:21:35,682 --> 01:21:37,475
Come on Jackie.

1717
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:39,811
- Snap out of it. Hey.
- Come on baby.

1718
01:21:39,895 --> 01:21:41,062
Jackie.

1719
01:21:44,566 --> 01:21:45,901
Mom.

1720
01:21:48,236 --> 01:21:50,989
- I miss you, Mama.
- I miss you too honey.

1721
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:54,868
- Come on little fella. Jackie.
- Jackie.

1722
01:21:54,951 --> 01:21:56,912
Clarence what are you doin' here?

1723
01:21:56,995 --> 01:22:00,624
What it look like?
I'm wit' y'all. He a'ight?

1724
01:22:00,707 --> 01:22:03,877
Are you outta your mind?
You wanna lose your NBA contract?

1725
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:08,381
I don't care nothin' about that man. This
is our season and we gonna finish it.

1726
01:22:08,465 --> 01:22:10,175
So you're gonna blow the deal for this?

1727
01:22:10,258 --> 01:22:13,011
- Fourth place right?
- Right.

1728
01:22:13,094 --> 01:22:15,138
- Let's get Tropical.
- Right on.

1729
01:22:15,221 --> 01:22:17,390
Come on buddy. Come around.

1730
01:22:18,391 --> 01:22:20,101
Now I want you to go forward...

1731
01:22:20,185 --> 01:22:23,438
and tell the others
what I have told you here today.

1732
01:22:23,521 --> 01:22:25,190
Do you understand me son?

1733
01:22:25,273 --> 01:22:27,651
Yes Mama. You're so kind.

1734
01:22:28,652 --> 01:22:30,320
I'm sorry I stole your song.

1735
01:22:30,403 --> 01:22:33,239
Oh I forgave you for that a long time ago.

1736
01:22:33,323 --> 01:22:36,618
Jackie it's time you forgave yourself.

1737
01:22:37,661 --> 01:22:40,705
I don't wanna leave this place.
It's so fluffy.

1738
01:22:40,789 --> 01:22:44,584
Now hurry up
and don't forget what I said.

1739
01:22:44,668 --> 01:22:46,795
OK. Bye!

1740
01:22:47,963 --> 01:22:50,215
Bye Mama. Bye.

1741
01:22:50,298 --> 01:22:52,050
Bye.

1742
01:22:52,133 --> 01:22:54,803
Oh hey--I threw up Mom.

1743
01:22:54,886 --> 01:22:57,430
I know you did sweetie.

1744
01:22:57,514 --> 01:22:59,808
I threw up all by myself!

1745
01:23:02,519 --> 01:23:03,937
- That's workin'.
- Here we go. Come on Jackie.

1746
01:23:04,020 --> 01:23:06,064
A little eye flutter. Hello fella!

1747
01:23:06,147 --> 01:23:07,732
- Hey there!
- Mornin' sunshine.

1748
01:23:07,816 --> 01:23:08,942
We missed ya.

1749
01:23:09,025 --> 01:23:10,402
Oh this just in.

1750
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:13,905
It sounds like Jackie Moon is up
and around the Tropics locker room.

1751
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:18,451
Then fake the pass and go straight
to the basket. Twiggy how hard is it?

1752
01:23:18,535 --> 01:23:20,620
He keeps throwin' elbows.
What do you want me to do?

1753
01:23:20,704 --> 01:23:23,081
I want you to stand up to him
ya pussy.

1754
01:23:23,164 --> 01:23:26,543
Monix wait. I gotta tell
these guys somethin'.

1755
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:29,587
I had a dream.

1756
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:32,257
I had a dream I was in heaven.

1757
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:34,884
And my mother spoke to me.

1758
01:23:34,968 --> 01:23:36,636
She was wearing
this flowing white gown...

1759
01:23:36,720 --> 01:23:40,515
and she showed me
a brand-new way to score a basket.

1760
01:23:40,598 --> 01:23:43,435
She called it the alley oop.

1761
01:23:44,394 --> 01:23:50,650
She spoke to me and she said
"With this gift you will win fourth place."

1762
01:23:57,699 --> 01:24:00,243
We are back in action here
at the Megabowl.

1763
01:24:00,326 --> 01:24:03,538
Coffee Black is playing for the Tropics.

1764
01:24:07,876 --> 01:24:09,335
Jackie makes the start here.

1765
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:13,131
In fact it looks like
he's running the offense.

1766
01:24:54,130 --> 01:24:55,215
What was that?

1767
01:24:55,298 --> 01:24:57,842
I'm sorry I don't know
what just happened.

1768
01:24:57,926 --> 01:25:02,305
A very unusual series of moves
just made the ball go in.

1769
01:25:05,266 --> 01:25:06,726
Damn.

1770
01:25:06,810 --> 01:25:10,396
Yeah I don't know why Dick
but I just got an erection.

1771
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:11,648
Oh.

1772
01:25:15,610 --> 01:25:17,862
Foul. No two fouls.

1773
01:25:17,946 --> 01:25:20,949
Foul?! I didn't touch anybody.

1774
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:23,034
Look Jackie people can't just
go flyin' in the air like that.

1775
01:25:23,118 --> 01:25:25,453
Oh, please. My mom
wouldn't cheat in my dreams.

1776
01:25:25,537 --> 01:25:27,789
- What?
- She's an angel!

1777
01:25:27,872 --> 01:25:29,791
Heaven wants us to win this game!

1778
01:25:29,874 --> 01:25:32,252
- I'll burn your house down!
- Oh, hold it, hold it, hold it.

1779
01:25:32,335 --> 01:25:35,130
It can't be a foul without
touchin' another player.

1780
01:25:35,213 --> 01:25:38,591
And it can't be traveling without
first establishing a pivot foot.

1781
01:25:38,675 --> 01:25:40,552
- That's right.
- It's two points Father Pat.

1782
01:25:40,635 --> 01:25:41,970
It is two points.

1783
01:25:45,765 --> 01:25:49,018
- All right I'm gonna allow it.
- That's the gospel.

1784
01:25:49,102 --> 01:25:51,229
Two points Flint.

1785
01:25:51,312 --> 01:25:52,647
Are you outta your mind?

1786
01:25:52,730 --> 01:25:54,774
- He was floating. Is this ghost ball?
- It's legal, Coach.

1787
01:25:54,858 --> 01:25:56,317
- It's legal Coach.
- What the hell is that?

1788
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:58,236
Yeah!

1789
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:00,572
It worked Jackie!

1790
01:26:00,655 --> 01:26:03,491
Thanks Mama! Whoo!

1791
01:26:03,575 --> 01:26:06,035
Things are getting interesting
here in the second half.

1792
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:09,122
It's the Spurs' ball
as Rebenkoff makes a shot.

1793
01:26:09,205 --> 01:26:11,666
Misses it. Rebound Tropics.

1794
01:26:15,044 --> 01:26:16,004
There it is again.

1795
01:26:16,087 --> 01:26:19,465
Clarence leaping and forcing the ball in
a downward direction through the net...

1796
01:26:19,549 --> 01:26:21,593
off of a high arching pass.

1797
01:26:21,676 --> 01:26:22,927
- It's a great play.
- It sure is.

1798
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:27,724
Hold on. I'm just being told
that this is called an alley oop!

1799
01:26:27,807 --> 01:26:29,309
Yes that is easier to say.

1800
01:26:29,392 --> 01:26:31,019
Twig!

1801
01:26:32,020 --> 01:26:33,521
Monix passes to Jackie.

1802
01:26:33,605 --> 01:26:34,689
Jackie lobs to Clarence.

1803
01:26:34,772 --> 01:26:36,608
And then yes! Another alley oop.

1804
01:26:36,691 --> 01:26:38,443
The Spurs don't know what's hit 'em.

1805
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:40,778
- I love the alley oop!
- Ha ha!

1806
01:26:44,407 --> 01:26:45,658
Yes! Yeah!

1807
01:26:47,118 --> 01:26:49,662
I wanna take you higher

1808
01:26:51,915 --> 01:26:54,125
I wanna take you higher

1809
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:55,168
Here comes the alley.

1810
01:26:55,251 --> 01:26:57,378
And there goes the oop!

1811
01:27:07,263 --> 01:27:08,388
Timeout white.

1812
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:08,765
Timeout white.

1813
01:27:08,848 --> 01:27:12,018
In all my years of radio
I've never seen anything like this.

1814
01:27:12,101 --> 01:27:15,188
The Tropics have fought their way back
from a huge deficit...

1815
01:27:15,271 --> 01:27:18,816
and now with 12 seconds left
in the history of this franchise...

1816
01:27:18,900 --> 01:27:22,737
they are down by two,
and man you can feel the tension.

1817
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:25,073
OK, guys, listen up.
They've made adjustments.

1818
01:27:25,156 --> 01:27:27,825
We can't keep runnin' the alley oop.
They're keying on Clarence.

1819
01:27:27,909 --> 01:27:30,161
So we're not gonna run the alley oop.

1820
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:32,830
- What the hell we gonna run then?
- The puke.

1821
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:34,040
The puke?

1822
01:27:34,123 --> 01:27:37,168
Don't tell me you've forgotten it.
I seared it into your brains.

1823
01:27:37,252 --> 01:27:40,838
- This will work OK? The puke.
- Right on.

1824
01:27:40,922 --> 01:27:42,799
I was gonna say exactly the same thing.

1825
01:27:42,882 --> 01:27:45,885
Good call. "Let's get Tropical" on three.
One two three.

1826
01:27:45,969 --> 01:27:48,054
Let's get Tropical!

1827
01:27:48,137 --> 01:27:49,597
We're down to the last play.

1828
01:27:49,681 --> 01:27:51,015
Monix inbounds to Jackie.

1829
01:27:51,099 --> 01:27:53,017
Jackie passes right back to Monix.

1830
01:27:53,101 --> 01:27:54,852
Monix back to Jackie.

1831
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:57,438
The Tropics have gotta
make a move here Dick.

1832
01:27:57,522 --> 01:27:59,857
Yeah they need to find a way
to the hole and fast.

1833
01:27:59,941 --> 01:28:03,194
Monix finds Bee Bee.
Back door to Jackie. He goes up strong--

1834
01:28:03,278 --> 01:28:06,322
- Ooh! Fouled hard by Petrelli!
- Eat shit Petrelli!

1835
01:28:06,406 --> 01:28:08,032
Don't you know
how to play basketball?

1836
01:28:09,784 --> 01:28:11,744
Father Pat struggles to keep order...

1837
01:28:11,828 --> 01:28:14,455
between these two tough
competitive teams.

1838
01:28:14,539 --> 01:28:18,459
All right. Black. Four-two.
With the body. Two shots.

1839
01:28:18,543 --> 01:28:21,671
- Come on Jackie!
- Jackie will shoot two free throws here.

1840
01:28:21,754 --> 01:28:25,133
His team down by two
with two seconds left on the clock.

1841
01:28:25,216 --> 01:28:28,928
All right, gentlemen.
Relax on the first one we got two here.

1842
01:28:29,012 --> 01:28:31,222
Come on Jackie.

1843
01:28:31,306 --> 01:28:34,976
Don't worry guys. I got these.
I'm very good at free throws.

1844
01:28:35,059 --> 01:28:39,314
Seriously free throws are probably
the best facet of my game.

1845
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:42,233
Whew.

1846
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:44,986
- Whew.
- What the hell are you doin' Jackie?

1847
01:28:45,069 --> 01:28:47,572
What, you never see me
shoot free throws before?

1848
01:28:47,655 --> 01:28:50,074
He's shootin' granny style.
Let 'im do his thing.

1849
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:51,576
Always has.

1850
01:28:51,659 --> 01:28:53,661
- Ah shit.
- Whew.

1851
01:28:54,662 --> 01:28:56,205
Whew. Here we go.

1852
01:28:57,832 --> 01:29:01,919
Jackie Moon holding the fate of Flint
in his fingertips.

1853
01:29:02,003 --> 01:29:04,797
- He kisses the ball for good luck.
- Whew. Sweet sugar.

1854
01:29:08,426 --> 01:29:10,511
It's good!

1855
01:29:10,595 --> 01:29:13,848
