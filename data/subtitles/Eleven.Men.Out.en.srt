00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:12,074
Meet local girls from Snapchat on 
DMhookup.com

2
00:00:16,175 --> 00:00:18,405
Fucking idiot.

3
00:00:22,815 --> 00:00:24,533
Send him off!

4
00:00:45,495 --> 00:00:48,851
ELEVEN MEN OUT

5
00:01:45,415 --> 00:01:47,770
Your dad's playing well.

6
00:01:52,815 --> 00:01:55,409
Where were you in defence?
What do you mean?

7
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:02,570
Are you the one
from the magazine?

8
00:02:02,855 --> 00:02:03,970
Do you have time?

9
00:02:04,295 --> 00:02:06,684
Yes, let's do it in
the locker room.

10
00:02:07,175 --> 00:02:08,574
She wasn't really into it
at first

11
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:11,614
so I just whipped it out.

12
00:02:11,975 --> 00:02:13,408
Shit, man, didn't she faint?

13
00:02:13,695 --> 00:02:16,846
Of course she did. It's so big!

14
00:02:20,295 --> 00:02:22,763
Put that away before
you hurt yourself, lad.

15
00:02:25,335 --> 00:02:27,166
This lady is with me, guys.

16
00:02:27,495 --> 00:02:29,247
Hey, shit!

17
00:02:29,655 --> 00:02:30,929
What's the
matter with you?

18
00:02:31,255 --> 00:02:32,847
Why don't you join
us in the showers?

19
00:02:33,535 --> 00:02:35,207
What did you think of the game?

20
00:02:35,535 --> 00:02:37,890
It was okay,
wasn't it? You won.

21
00:02:38,655 --> 00:02:39,690
Didn't you see the penalty?

22
00:02:40,135 --> 00:02:41,534
I'm not into football.

23
00:02:41,895 --> 00:02:43,169
Am I on the cover?

24
00:02:44,055 --> 00:02:45,090
You're on the back page,

25
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,973
the last thing people read.

26
00:02:47,575 --> 00:02:50,965
The back? What the hell
are you talking about?

27
00:02:51,295 --> 00:02:53,445
Who do you think you are?
Some superstar?

28
00:02:54,015 --> 00:02:55,050
I should be on
the fucking front page,

29
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:56,649
we're top of the league.

30
00:02:56,975 --> 00:02:58,931
Football doesn't sell copies,
it's not sexy enough.

31
00:02:59,295 --> 00:03:01,172
I'll give you a story
that sells.

32
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,405
Round up, there's
something I've got to tell you.

33
00:03:19,655 --> 00:03:20,929
I don't really know
how to put this,

34
00:03:21,255 --> 00:03:23,769
so I'll give it to you straight.

35
00:03:25,295 --> 00:03:27,411
I've known this for some time.

36
00:03:27,695 --> 00:03:31,244
I'm gay...
a homosexual.

37
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:33,128
You're on the cover now...

38
00:03:34,095 --> 00:03:38,293
I want to say something too,
I understand you and I want you.

39
00:03:39,735 --> 00:03:43,045
Hey, I'm not joking here.
- Stop talking crap, man.

40
00:03:43,975 --> 00:03:45,533
What, are you serious?

41
00:03:46,535 --> 00:03:48,366
Yes, I'm gay.

42
00:03:48,775 --> 00:03:51,289
Could I have one photo
in the shower?

43
00:04:02,295 --> 00:04:03,614
Dad, I don't want to talk about
this right now,

44
00:04:03,895 --> 00:04:04,805
this is my decision.

45
00:04:05,055 --> 00:04:06,693
How could you do this to me?

46
00:04:06,975 --> 00:04:08,454
Are you on drugs?

47
00:04:09,455 --> 00:04:10,774
Maggi, wait for me in the car.

48
00:04:11,055 --> 00:04:12,044
Dad, I'm gay.

49
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:14,166
Don't say that again,
don't say that in front of the lads.

50
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:16,366
We'll fix this.
- What do you mean?

51
00:04:16,695 --> 00:04:20,324
I'll get you a shrink.
There must be a cure for this.

52
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:24,655
Dad, don't start that crap.

53
00:04:25,735 --> 00:04:27,214
What's up, Eiríkur?

54
00:04:27,535 --> 00:04:29,571
Hear your son's a fairy.

55
00:04:30,455 --> 00:04:33,094
Fuck off home, you got
practice tomorrow!

56
00:04:33,415 --> 00:04:35,371
Shouldn't we collect
the balls first?

57
00:04:35,695 --> 00:04:37,811
Shut up or I'll throw
you into reserves!

58
00:04:39,335 --> 00:04:40,927
Jesus Christ.

59
00:04:41,175 --> 00:04:43,848
Reserves? No way, man.
Boy is he mad.

60
00:06:03,255 --> 00:06:06,486
Maggi told me everything.
What are you thinking of?

61
00:06:06,735 --> 00:06:08,453
I don't want to discuss
this with you.

62
00:06:09,015 --> 00:06:10,687
You sure
chose the right moment.

63
00:06:10,975 --> 00:06:13,933
You think of no one but yourself.
He's in shock...

64
00:06:14,175 --> 00:06:17,884
Cool it. Yeah, cool it. You're
the one who should cool it.

65
00:06:18,135 --> 00:06:20,490
You're the queer around here,
aren't you?

66
00:06:21,975 --> 00:06:25,490
Show me some respect for a
change. - That's a good one.

67
00:06:25,775 --> 00:06:28,164
Where is he now? Who?
Where's our son now?

68
00:06:29,175 --> 00:06:31,052
He's with someone.

69
00:06:32,015 --> 00:06:33,607
It's none of your business
who's minding him,

70
00:06:33,975 --> 00:06:35,169
do you think I'd just
dump him anywhere?

71
00:06:35,415 --> 00:06:36,211
I can't talk to you
in this state,

72
00:06:36,455 --> 00:06:37,365
you're just drunk
and boring.

73
00:06:37,735 --> 00:06:38,770
Shut up, You're just
an asshole, know that?

74
00:06:39,095 --> 00:06:40,164
You're pathetic.

75
00:06:40,735 --> 00:06:42,293
Gugga, come and dance,
can I steal her for a moment?

76
00:06:42,655 --> 00:06:43,929
Sure, go ahead.

77
00:06:44,655 --> 00:06:49,092
A pint. What'll you have?

78
00:06:50,455 --> 00:06:52,286
Just a beer.

79
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,365
Stop it.

80
00:07:16,655 --> 00:07:17,883
Cut that out.

81
00:07:18,295 --> 00:07:19,808
But you like it,
don't you?

82
00:07:20,255 --> 00:07:21,324
Yeah, give us a kiss.

83
00:07:21,655 --> 00:07:22,690
Joke! Fat chance.

84
00:07:23,015 --> 00:07:24,004
Cut it out.

85
00:07:24,335 --> 00:07:25,529
Are you crazy?

86
00:07:25,895 --> 00:07:26,884
You're loving this. Come on.

87
00:07:27,935 --> 00:07:29,414
Come on.

88
00:07:30,535 --> 00:07:32,526
Why are you grabbing me?
Stop it.

89
00:07:33,055 --> 00:07:35,523
How long is it since you
came out of the...

90
00:07:35,895 --> 00:07:38,409
Jesus Christ, she's always
the same slut.

91
00:07:42,335 --> 00:07:44,053
How is she taking it?

92
00:07:44,575 --> 00:07:48,090
Terribly, they're total morons,
I've had enough of this.

93
00:07:48,535 --> 00:07:49,411
A shot of "Hot and sweet"?

94
00:07:51,615 --> 00:07:53,446
It's always the same,
year after year.

95
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,413
What's it going to be
like next year?

96
00:07:57,775 --> 00:07:59,174
For the reunion.

97
00:07:59,775 --> 00:08:00,810
No title.

98
00:08:01,135 --> 00:08:03,285
Knocked out in the 5th
round of the cup.

99
00:08:04,575 --> 00:08:05,928
Can't be any worse.

100
00:08:06,615 --> 00:08:08,412
I wouldn't bet on it.

101
00:08:13,335 --> 00:08:15,485
Are you doing any
playing yourself?

102
00:08:15,935 --> 00:08:17,687
Me and the lads are
playing once a week,

103
00:08:18,015 --> 00:08:20,006
want to take a look?

104
00:08:21,655 --> 00:08:23,247
I can give you a lift?

105
00:08:23,655 --> 00:08:25,646
Football is shit.

106
00:08:29,015 --> 00:08:32,451
There are two guys
in the team who are kind of gay.

107
00:08:33,175 --> 00:08:34,733
Kind of?

108
00:08:35,095 --> 00:08:36,369
Well, they're actually gay.

109
00:08:37,135 --> 00:08:40,445
You might like to meet them,
or something?

110
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,005
I can pop around.

111
00:08:48,935 --> 00:08:50,334
They're great guys.

112
00:09:29,535 --> 00:09:31,571
Gugga, what are you
doing? Get out of here.

113
00:09:32,975 --> 00:09:34,806
Jesus, what's going on here?

114
00:09:35,095 --> 00:09:37,404
I'm trying to take a leak.

115
00:09:38,095 --> 00:09:39,926
Let me give you a
blow job then.

116
00:09:40,335 --> 00:09:41,848
Jesus Christ.
What are you doing?

117
00:09:42,215 --> 00:09:43,933
Jesus, I can't take this!

118
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:53,253
Lads, we've got to
fucking fix this.

119
00:09:53,815 --> 00:09:55,806
By castrating him?

120
00:09:56,255 --> 00:09:59,645
It's terrible for
our image to lose him like this...

121
00:10:00,295 --> 00:10:02,650
You're a shrink,
Ási, can't you fix this?

122
00:10:03,495 --> 00:10:04,405
The sex drive is...

123
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:08,012
He hasn't quit,
no-one says he's quit.

124
00:10:08,815 --> 00:10:10,043
That's not on the cards.

125
00:10:10,415 --> 00:10:12,610
It is, if he's going
behave like a queer.

126
00:10:13,215 --> 00:10:15,012
He might contaminate
the younger lads.

127
00:10:15,335 --> 00:10:16,211
It's not contagious.

128
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:18,608
Just think of our Olga.

129
00:10:18,935 --> 00:10:20,004
She got caught up
in shit like this,

130
00:10:20,295 --> 00:10:22,092
and where is she now?
The Westman Islands.

131
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:25,330
This is just a temporary
situation.

132
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,411
It'll all blow over.
Yeah yeah.

133
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:29,963
I'll fix this.

134
00:10:30,375 --> 00:10:32,093
I'm not one for
spreading gossip,

135
00:10:32,455 --> 00:10:35,606
but I've heard
disgusting stories.

136
00:10:37,335 --> 00:10:39,405
Really disgusting.

137
00:10:39,775 --> 00:10:41,447
Perverted.

138
00:10:41,855 --> 00:10:45,052
Then he has the nerve to
turn up at the reunion.

139
00:10:45,655 --> 00:10:47,771
Hang on, what did you hear?

140
00:10:48,215 --> 00:10:50,445
What's so bad
about being gay?

141
00:10:50,935 --> 00:10:52,573
Isn't everyone these days?

142
00:10:52,895 --> 00:10:54,408
Are you gay?

143
00:10:54,815 --> 00:10:56,726
That's a lie.

144
00:10:57,855 --> 00:11:00,050
Look, I can assure
you my son is not...

145
00:11:01,295 --> 00:11:03,047
Gay, go on, just say it.

146
00:11:03,975 --> 00:11:08,810
I don't want no ass
bugger in my team.

147
00:11:11,095 --> 00:11:13,734
We've got to bar him.

148
00:11:14,095 --> 00:11:16,734
He's not playing with us if
he's a pervert.

149
00:11:21,335 --> 00:11:22,927
What are you doing here?

150
00:11:23,255 --> 00:11:25,211
Haven't you
spoken to your dad?

151
00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:28,049
You're off the team
so you're not allowed.

152
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:30,730
Is this a joke?
Do you find this funny?

153
00:11:31,055 --> 00:11:32,807
No.
- Aren't you gay?

154
00:11:33,135 --> 00:11:35,012
We can't have gays
playing with the champions.

155
00:11:35,295 --> 00:11:36,853
Go join some other team.

156
00:11:38,535 --> 00:11:40,253
Go fuck yourself,
leave me alone,

157
00:11:40,775 --> 00:11:42,811
I'm busy.
Go talk to your dad.

158
00:12:01,535 --> 00:12:04,049
Ottar dear,
come in for a second.

159
00:12:08,295 --> 00:12:09,808
What is she doing here?

160
00:12:10,135 --> 00:12:11,284
Whisky, Ottar?

161
00:12:12,295 --> 00:12:14,286
Where's Maggi?

162
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,969
He's at the
Counterstrike tournament.

163
00:12:19,735 --> 00:12:23,091
Sit down and chat
with your brother and the girls.

164
00:12:25,415 --> 00:12:26,370
Orri.

165
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:28,333
Yeah, sorry man.

166
00:12:31,895 --> 00:12:34,011
So how's it going, pal?

167
00:12:34,335 --> 00:12:35,609
Just fine.

168
00:12:39,135 --> 00:12:42,411
We just wanted to have
a chat with you,

169
00:12:42,735 --> 00:12:45,886
just the family.

170
00:12:46,255 --> 00:12:49,327
Yeah, we're only here
to help you. Orri and I,

171
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:51,014
and Gugga of course.

172
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:53,684
I also have a friend...
- Shut up.

173
00:12:54,335 --> 00:12:56,803
You know I still love you.

174
00:12:57,175 --> 00:13:00,645
Shit, you're a mess. What
the fuck is she doing here?

175
00:13:01,535 --> 00:13:03,730
Isn't this good, the family?

176
00:13:04,055 --> 00:13:06,330
Just sitting down and
talking things over.

177
00:13:07,295 --> 00:13:09,206
Yeah, we're just
talking things over here.

178
00:13:09,575 --> 00:13:12,965
People need to talk,
all of us together. Always!

179
00:13:14,015 --> 00:13:16,529
This is no small situation
that you've gotten us into.

180
00:13:16,815 --> 00:13:18,567
Surely you realise that.

181
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:22,724
It's a shock for us...
the fact that you're...

182
00:13:23,455 --> 00:13:26,049
Gay!
That you are Gay!

183
00:13:27,215 --> 00:13:29,524
This gay shit of yours
is just bullshit.

184
00:13:29,855 --> 00:13:31,971
I'll go see if
dinner's ready.

185
00:13:33,335 --> 00:13:35,530
Cut it out, Orri,

186
00:13:35,975 --> 00:13:38,045
I don't have to put
up with this shit.

187
00:13:38,455 --> 00:13:39,683
Just listen to him.

188
00:13:40,015 --> 00:13:41,414
Shut up! What are you
doing here anyway?

189
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:42,650
I've come to help you.

190
00:13:43,015 --> 00:13:44,528
OK lads,
the meat's ready.

191
00:14:10,535 --> 00:14:12,969
Where's mom?
Isn't she going to eat with us?

192
00:14:13,295 --> 00:14:15,251
She went down to the club.

193
00:14:16,095 --> 00:14:17,574
It's women's night at KR.

194
00:14:17,935 --> 00:14:19,209
So did you cook for us?

195
00:14:19,495 --> 00:14:21,565
Hey, bitch!
Not a word out of you.

196
00:14:25,535 --> 00:14:27,526
I've had enough
of this crap.

197
00:14:27,855 --> 00:14:29,811
Can't you see what
you're doing to me?

198
00:14:31,215 --> 00:14:33,445
I'm just thinking things over.

199
00:14:34,215 --> 00:14:36,171
Don't give me any
of that crap.

200
00:14:36,535 --> 00:14:37,331
Dad!

201
00:14:37,735 --> 00:14:38,884
Pull yourself together

202
00:14:39,175 --> 00:14:41,166
and stop all this
gay nonsense!

203
00:14:41,615 --> 00:14:45,608
Your mother and Gugga here...

204
00:14:47,775 --> 00:14:48,525
Sit down, Ottar,

205
00:14:48,775 --> 00:14:50,094
I'm talking to you, lad!

206
00:14:51,095 --> 00:14:54,371
You can't talk to the dude.
You know that. Jesus!

207
00:14:55,335 --> 00:14:58,247
He just needs some time.
- Shut up!

208
00:14:58,895 --> 00:15:01,011
They're born into the world,
you bring them up...

209
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:02,893
...teach them how to fend
for themselves and this

210
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,684
is all the thanks you get.
Fuck.

211
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:10,812
Ragnheidur!
You can come in now.

212
00:15:19,255 --> 00:15:21,086
Orri!
- Shut up!

213
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:29,128
He was so young
when he scored that goal

214
00:15:29,455 --> 00:15:31,411
against those fucking Italians.

215
00:15:31,695 --> 00:15:33,333
Only 15.

216
00:15:33,695 --> 00:15:36,448
Dad. He's gay.
A faggot!

217
00:15:37,495 --> 00:15:40,407
Lt'll be alright.

218
00:15:42,975 --> 00:15:44,567
Mom...

219
00:15:45,855 --> 00:15:48,130
...Did you make some
kind of pudding?

220
00:15:48,455 --> 00:15:49,604
Orri!

221
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:52,404
I'm in a hurry, I've got to go
and open the video store.

222
00:15:53,295 --> 00:15:54,250
Orri, we should leave.

223
00:15:54,815 --> 00:15:56,453
You go and wash up
or something.

224
00:15:56,775 --> 00:15:58,766
Try to do something
for a change.

225
00:15:59,095 --> 00:16:00,653
Stop bugging me,
I'm talking to Mom.

226
00:16:00,975 --> 00:16:02,488
Try to show your mom
some respect, lad.

227
00:16:03,215 --> 00:16:05,012
Maybe I'll just
take it with me then.

228
00:16:05,495 --> 00:16:08,089
I'll bring the bowl
back of course.

229
00:16:08,735 --> 00:16:10,771
This isn't like the time
I took the soda-stream thing,

230
00:16:11,215 --> 00:16:12,807
I'll bring it back. I Promise.

231
00:16:13,215 --> 00:16:15,490
There's some cream
in the fridge.

232
00:16:16,055 --> 00:16:18,125
OK mom.
See you, coach.

233
00:16:27,815 --> 00:16:29,567
Shouldn't
we get going?

234
00:16:30,575 --> 00:16:32,691
Yeah, Maggi, aren't
you coming with us?

235
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,127
No, I've got to
complete this mission.

236
00:16:38,175 --> 00:16:40,086
Don't you want to
get dressed and...

237
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:41,444
Cool it.

238
00:16:48,055 --> 00:16:49,329
What mission?

239
00:16:49,655 --> 00:16:51,805
I'm killing these
mobsters...

240
00:16:57,895 --> 00:17:00,250
These are great guys,
you know.

241
00:17:01,615 --> 00:17:04,527
You know, we're pretty
easy-going around here.

242
00:17:06,215 --> 00:17:08,570
Come on, lads,
put some sweat into it!

243
00:17:09,535 --> 00:17:11,332
Here's Ottar.

244
00:17:12,415 --> 00:17:15,407
Well then,
where are the gays?

245
00:17:16,335 --> 00:17:20,408
You won't be disappointed.
Daniel, come over.

246
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:22,612
I want to introduce you
to our new striker.

247
00:17:23,455 --> 00:17:25,923
Guys! This is our
new striker, Ottar Thor.

248
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:31,289
Weren't you on
the KR team?

249
00:17:31,855 --> 00:17:33,732
Let's split into teams.

250
00:17:34,335 --> 00:17:36,405
Ottar, don't you want
to go and change?

251
00:17:38,135 --> 00:17:39,807
Right, lads, line up!

252
00:17:40,095 --> 00:17:41,164
Into what?

253
00:17:41,775 --> 00:17:44,050
Well, what do you think?

254
00:17:44,615 --> 00:17:49,484
Great, good fun,
a lot better than I imagined.

255
00:17:50,415 --> 00:17:51,530
You're just being polite.

256
00:17:51,615 --> 00:17:52,809
I mean it.

257
00:17:53,095 --> 00:17:54,369
Thanks for the game.

258
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,650
You too.

259
00:17:55,935 --> 00:17:57,493
Matti, have you got
any hair conditioner?

260
00:17:57,815 --> 00:17:58,964
Are you out of your mind?

261
00:17:59,335 --> 00:18:00,563
I've got some,
what do you want?

262
00:18:00,655 --> 00:18:01,610
Redkin or Aveda?

263
00:18:01,695 --> 00:18:02,650
Just Redkin.

264
00:18:05,215 --> 00:18:07,570
Ottar, have you had
a go at screwing Danny here?

265
00:18:07,895 --> 00:18:08,964
I'm out of here.

266
00:18:09,215 --> 00:18:10,284
Don't go.

267
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:12,486
You've got to try it sometime,
it's really good, man.

268
00:18:12,855 --> 00:18:14,288
Isn't Matti here
next in line?

269
00:18:14,655 --> 00:18:16,168
Hey, don't give me that.

270
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:17,644
Stop it!

271
00:18:18,015 --> 00:18:19,733
Next meeting is on
Friday.

272
00:18:20,015 --> 00:18:21,892
Stop it! God, you're a pain!

273
00:18:25,455 --> 00:18:27,810
We've done quite well
in the amateur league.

274
00:18:28,255 --> 00:18:30,291
But been stuck in third place
for most of the summer.

275
00:18:30,615 --> 00:18:32,333
Just need one push
to the top of the league.

276
00:18:32,735 --> 00:18:35,568
We need to tighten our
team work a bit, better attack.

277
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:37,330
What do you mean?

278
00:18:37,695 --> 00:18:40,004
You're cute, honey,
just not aggressive enough.

279
00:18:40,855 --> 00:18:42,334
I haven't stopped playing
for KR yet.

280
00:18:42,735 --> 00:18:44,327
Your dad won't stand
for that.

281
00:18:44,815 --> 00:18:46,248
No, he'll shove you straight back
into the closet, love.

282
00:18:46,975 --> 00:18:48,533
Fancy sitting on the
bench all summer?

283
00:18:53,535 --> 00:18:55,287
Can I give you
a lift somewhere?

284
00:18:55,695 --> 00:18:58,289
Actually I have a car,
but yeah, why not?

285
00:18:58,895 --> 00:18:59,930
Bye.

286
00:19:01,055 --> 00:19:02,932
I've got to pop in
somewhere first.

287
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:05,205
Fancy a barbecue?

288
00:19:05,295 --> 00:19:06,330
Sure.

289
00:19:12,695 --> 00:19:14,686
The homies are on the
balcony, come in.

290
00:19:18,855 --> 00:19:20,083
What's she doing here?

291
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:22,127
Sopranos, all in the family.

292
00:19:32,415 --> 00:19:34,849
Have you given any thought to
women's football, Pétur?

293
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,604
Pálmi is doing great with
the women's team, man.

294
00:19:38,015 --> 00:19:41,724
I saw them play those Italian
sluts, fucking great stuff, man.

295
00:19:42,255 --> 00:19:43,654
He did a great
fucking job on them.

296
00:19:45,655 --> 00:19:47,532
Once you've proven yourself
with the women,

297
00:19:47,935 --> 00:19:50,130
the national mens team
could be next!

298
00:19:52,775 --> 00:19:54,094
See what you've done?

299
00:19:54,815 --> 00:19:57,773
I don't believe it,
they just scored!

300
00:19:59,215 --> 00:20:00,728
So he kept on
sending me letters

301
00:20:01,055 --> 00:20:02,647
and stuff,

302
00:20:03,335 --> 00:20:04,893
and then when my wisdom
teeth were taken out,

303
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,491
he sent me a box of ice-pops!

304
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,252
I swear, don't you think
that's cute?

305
00:20:10,735 --> 00:20:12,373
How long have you
guys been together?

306
00:20:12,815 --> 00:20:14,612
Wow, that's been nearly...

307
00:20:17,535 --> 00:20:20,049
Two months. Shit!

308
00:20:20,535 --> 00:20:26,610
Dad can be a bit difficult, but
mom is softer than the old man.

309
00:20:27,055 --> 00:20:30,206
I'm working on him.

310
00:20:31,575 --> 00:20:35,284
Trying to ease him into
the homo vibe.

311
00:20:35,655 --> 00:20:38,488
I rented him that
Philadelphia movie.

312
00:20:40,055 --> 00:20:41,727
That AIDS movie.

313
00:20:42,015 --> 00:20:42,891
The one with Tom Cruise?

314
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,044
Hanks.

315
00:20:44,815 --> 00:20:47,534
Yeah, the one about the
brave queer who dies.

316
00:20:49,335 --> 00:20:51,565
So how old were you
when you won the title?

317
00:20:52,935 --> 00:20:54,812
Yeah, you made a
great Miss Iceland.

318
00:20:55,135 --> 00:20:56,807
Yeah, you sure were.

319
00:20:57,775 --> 00:21:00,164
You must have been in
really good shape back then.

320
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:02,774
I suppose so, yeah.

321
00:21:03,255 --> 00:21:05,610
I'm just saying that when Peter
here was coaching Lilleström...

322
00:21:05,895 --> 00:21:07,613
They lost every game
that season...

323
00:21:07,975 --> 00:21:09,408
That's why he's just
coaching amateurs

324
00:21:09,775 --> 00:21:10,890
and working
in the video store...

325
00:21:11,375 --> 00:21:13,172
He's lost all credibility.

326
00:21:14,095 --> 00:21:15,972
We managed a draw
against Rosenborg.

327
00:21:18,775 --> 00:21:20,208
It's incredible how
unlucky

328
00:21:20,495 --> 00:21:23,009
Lilleström has been with its
coaches.

329
00:21:23,655 --> 00:21:26,123
What was the name of
that dude before you again?

330
00:21:26,855 --> 00:21:28,413
You mean Stefán Oli?

331
00:21:28,735 --> 00:21:29,804
He killed
himself, didn't he?

332
00:21:30,135 --> 00:21:30,931
Shut up, Orri.

333
00:21:31,255 --> 00:21:32,404
It wasn't because of that.

334
00:21:32,735 --> 00:21:35,124
I'm just saying that a
draw is for losers.

335
00:21:35,415 --> 00:21:36,814
Nothing personal.

336
00:21:37,175 --> 00:21:41,248
A draw is when you don't lose,
but you don't win anything either.

337
00:21:41,615 --> 00:21:43,128
Wasn't that before Ottar
came out?

338
00:21:43,495 --> 00:21:45,087
You were still together then,
weren't you?

339
00:21:45,695 --> 00:21:47,447
It was more on and off.

340
00:21:48,055 --> 00:21:50,250
Yeah, and then you
had that accident, didn't you?

341
00:21:51,095 --> 00:21:52,892
Hey, you were driving
drunk, weren't you?

342
00:21:53,335 --> 00:21:56,247
I remember Orri saying that.
Big scandal.

343
00:21:56,895 --> 00:21:58,613
It was in all the
gossip magazines.

344
00:21:59,175 --> 00:22:01,484
I'm not saying that goal you
scored wasn't any good.

345
00:22:01,775 --> 00:22:03,094
Against Arsenal.
It was fine.

346
00:22:03,455 --> 00:22:04,934
I'm not trying to take
that away from you.

347
00:22:05,215 --> 00:22:08,412
Want a hotdog?
Mustard, onion?

348
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:11,888
Got any mayonnaise?

349
00:22:13,975 --> 00:22:15,533
Jesus, man,
what the fuck's that?

350
00:22:15,775 --> 00:22:17,925
There's no mayonnaise here.

351
00:22:20,695 --> 00:22:23,732
Mustard or ketchup
or we just forget about it.

352
00:22:24,055 --> 00:22:25,568
It must have been
fun doing modelling

353
00:22:25,815 --> 00:22:27,009
after you won the title.

354
00:22:27,495 --> 00:22:29,372
All those fashion shows and
photo shoots?

355
00:22:31,335 --> 00:22:33,610
People often say, I should
be a model.

356
00:22:34,095 --> 00:22:35,574
Yeah, but still.

357
00:22:36,215 --> 00:22:37,887
You're not pretty enough.

358
00:22:38,295 --> 00:22:39,808
And you're also fat.

359
00:22:40,135 --> 00:22:41,045
Oh... I thought...

360
00:22:41,615 --> 00:22:43,333
No! It's just not like that.

361
00:22:47,615 --> 00:22:50,527
Let's have another drink.

362
00:22:51,815 --> 00:22:56,206
KR? The worst game of all time?
Screwed on their own turf!

363
00:22:57,015 --> 00:22:58,334
The lines are open.

364
00:22:58,615 --> 00:23:00,014
Hello, who's speaking?

365
00:23:00,855 --> 00:23:03,164
First I'd like to thank you
for a great programme.

366
00:23:03,535 --> 00:23:05,924
What's happened to Ottar Thor?
Has he changed sides?

367
00:23:06,215 --> 00:23:07,807
Is there any truth
to these rumours?

368
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,687
That he's going to be
playing with girls?

369
00:23:09,975 --> 00:23:13,604
You're referring to the
rumours regarding his sexuality?

370
00:23:14,215 --> 00:23:15,534
Isn't he a queer bast...

371
00:23:18,495 --> 00:23:19,848
It's your fault we lost.

372
00:23:20,215 --> 00:23:22,285
I'm just the way I am.
I am what I am.

373
00:23:22,615 --> 00:23:25,129
It's not my fault they
kicked me off KR.

374
00:23:26,335 --> 00:23:28,530
Are mass-murderers just
meant to be themselves?

375
00:23:28,855 --> 00:23:30,083
That's not
a fair comparison.

376
00:23:30,495 --> 00:23:31,644
What's this asshole
doing here, anyway?

377
00:23:31,975 --> 00:23:35,524
Take it easy.
We're just friends.

378
00:23:35,935 --> 00:23:37,926
You think of no-one
but yourself!

379
00:23:38,655 --> 00:23:41,169
They're going to give
me hell in school.

380
00:23:42,895 --> 00:23:44,328
I can deny it all.

381
00:23:44,695 --> 00:23:45,605
Then you're on the
magazine cover.

382
00:23:45,695 --> 00:23:47,367
Well, hopefully.

383
00:23:49,015 --> 00:23:51,529
You've just fucked everything
up, the way you always do!

384
00:23:51,815 --> 00:23:53,248
Can't you two just be friends?
- Shut up.

385
00:23:53,495 --> 00:23:54,894
He's just a spoilt brat.

386
00:24:01,975 --> 00:24:04,364
Hallo. Mom?

387
00:24:26,255 --> 00:24:28,530
Hey, who are we
playing against?

388
00:24:31,175 --> 00:24:33,291
Hi Maggi, how are you?

389
00:24:36,055 --> 00:24:39,172
Are we ready to party?
What, are you drunk?

390
00:24:39,735 --> 00:24:43,614
Listen, pal, take a cold
shower before you get changed.

391
00:24:43,895 --> 00:24:44,884
Are you Pétur?

392
00:24:45,255 --> 00:24:47,644
I hear this is a gay team.
I'm gay.

393
00:24:47,975 --> 00:24:49,124
This ain't no gay team.

394
00:24:49,415 --> 00:24:50,928
Doesn't matter, I'm gay
and I'm playing.

395
00:24:51,655 --> 00:24:53,566
I've had enough
of this fairy shit!

396
00:24:53,935 --> 00:24:54,890
Pétur, go after him.

397
00:24:54,975 --> 00:24:57,170
I heard you need a goalie.
- Yes, have you played?

398
00:24:58,415 --> 00:25:00,133
Well, you know,
with lots of teams.

399
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:01,325
In the amateur league.

400
00:25:01,655 --> 00:25:04,613
Welcome then. I'm Lára.
- I'm Brósi. Have you got a kit?

401
00:25:08,335 --> 00:25:09,768
We're not queers!

402
00:25:10,135 --> 00:25:12,524
Is it natural for footballers
to talk like this?

403
00:25:12,855 --> 00:25:14,732
"Hey, he's cute"
and all that kind of shit.

404
00:25:14,935 --> 00:25:17,403
Bullshit. Where did you
hear that?

405
00:25:18,535 --> 00:25:19,934
I don't want to be
on the bench all summer.

406
00:25:20,855 --> 00:25:22,607
Pétur, this isn't
going to work.

407
00:25:22,895 --> 00:25:24,123
Why not?

408
00:25:24,455 --> 00:25:26,923
The rumours about
our team.

409
00:25:27,535 --> 00:25:29,014
They're saying this
is a faggot's team.

410
00:25:29,095 --> 00:25:30,244
Who's saying that?

411
00:25:30,815 --> 00:25:34,330
Everyone. I can't play
on this team anymore.

412
00:25:35,655 --> 00:25:36,770
Why not?

413
00:25:37,215 --> 00:25:38,250
Are you prejudiced?

414
00:25:38,535 --> 00:25:39,809
I'm not.

415
00:25:40,215 --> 00:25:40,965
I know lots of gays.

416
00:25:41,255 --> 00:25:42,404
I'm just not
one myself.

417
00:25:42,735 --> 00:25:43,565
I'm not gay either.

418
00:25:43,655 --> 00:25:44,610
Yes you are.

419
00:25:44,855 --> 00:25:45,731
What's that supposed
to mean?

420
00:25:46,055 --> 00:25:47,534
What are you
talking about?

421
00:25:48,095 --> 00:25:49,926
This is a gay team
and I'm not gay.

422
00:25:51,095 --> 00:25:53,165
If you're not gay
then this isn't a gay team.

423
00:25:53,255 --> 00:25:54,529
Exactly.

424
00:25:55,495 --> 00:25:57,372
No, but that's what
everyone is saying.

425
00:25:57,975 --> 00:25:59,454
I can't play on
this team anymore.

426
00:26:00,615 --> 00:26:03,687
Come on, don't go!

427
00:26:05,615 --> 00:26:06,843
Right, shall we get going?

428
00:26:07,135 --> 00:26:09,126
We've got a situation here.

429
00:26:10,935 --> 00:26:13,608
Delta Force forfeit the game.
- Why?

430
00:26:13,935 --> 00:26:15,448
One of us is injured,
we're only ten.

431
00:26:16,695 --> 00:26:18,367
That's okay,
one of ours just quit...

432
00:26:18,695 --> 00:26:20,287
Let's not go crazy,
we have rules,

433
00:26:20,695 --> 00:26:21,810
It's eleven in each team.

434
00:26:24,815 --> 00:26:26,726
Okay...
We get three points then...

435
00:26:29,375 --> 00:26:31,013
Let's shake on it.

436
00:26:34,335 --> 00:26:35,450
What's going on?

437
00:26:35,735 --> 00:26:36,963
They're giving us the game.

438
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,525
They don't want to play us.
You know that bloody well.

439
00:26:39,855 --> 00:26:41,288
Homos 3 points,
Homophobia 0 points.

440
00:26:41,895 --> 00:26:42,611
That's great, man.

441
00:26:47,455 --> 00:26:48,285
Hey, they gave
the game away.

442
00:26:48,575 --> 00:26:49,246
Really?

443
00:26:49,895 --> 00:26:52,284
Yeah, we're top of the league.

444
00:26:58,055 --> 00:27:00,250
Hey, Maggi is out front.

445
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,925
This one here has always been
one of my favourites.

446
00:27:09,655 --> 00:27:12,647
It's Japanese, from Japan.

447
00:27:13,695 --> 00:27:14,844
It's oriental.

448
00:27:16,455 --> 00:27:18,173
Looks exotic.

449
00:27:18,655 --> 00:27:20,691
This is just basic shit,
man.

450
00:27:21,895 --> 00:27:23,533
Look at the dick
on that babe,

451
00:27:24,135 --> 00:27:26,091
it doesn't get
any better than that.

452
00:27:28,535 --> 00:27:29,854
That's incredible.

453
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:32,251
Come on,
you dirty old man.

454
00:27:33,575 --> 00:27:36,806
Hi there, kid,
how's it going?

455
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:41,448
I'm picking up a tape for dad.

456
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,526
Your dad still
owes me.

457
00:27:48,495 --> 00:27:49,530
That's just not
good enough.

458
00:27:49,855 --> 00:27:51,493
This isn't charity.

459
00:27:52,655 --> 00:27:54,850
I want to be paid so
you tell him that.

460
00:27:55,655 --> 00:27:57,247
I don't want to have
to blacklist him.

461
00:27:57,615 --> 00:27:59,890
Here's the tape,
get it back on time.

462
00:28:00,175 --> 00:28:02,166
There are rules.

463
00:28:16,535 --> 00:28:17,854
Leo is such a hunk.

464
00:28:18,135 --> 00:28:19,966
Really sexy.

465
00:28:21,655 --> 00:28:24,328
She's cute too,
nice boobs.

466
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:30,049
Leo put on weight after
he acted in that film the...

467
00:28:30,295 --> 00:28:31,728
The Beach.

468
00:28:34,535 --> 00:28:38,926
Yeah, I think it makes him sexier.
- Really?

469
00:28:40,695 --> 00:28:43,209
Makes you want to bite into him.

470
00:28:43,695 --> 00:28:47,005
Fucking gays, you turn it all
into some faggot bullshit.

471
00:28:47,855 --> 00:28:48,651
Fucking perverts.

472
00:28:48,975 --> 00:28:50,966
Maggi? Maggi!

473
00:28:52,375 --> 00:28:54,366
Oh, just let him go.

474
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:03,244
Blow me.

475
00:29:05,495 --> 00:29:06,848
Right now?

476
00:30:25,255 --> 00:30:27,530
People don't want to
play us anymore.

477
00:30:28,175 --> 00:30:31,292
That's pathetic,
this is a sick society.

478
00:30:32,095 --> 00:30:33,972
People are
so insane.

479
00:30:34,615 --> 00:30:37,652
Fuck it, this is a joke anyway.
Fuck it, this is a joke anyway.

480
00:30:37,975 --> 00:30:39,567
This is no joke.

481
00:30:40,935 --> 00:30:43,654
There are only five of us,
we need six to play.

482
00:30:44,055 --> 00:30:45,044
Can't we just phone someone?

483
00:30:45,655 --> 00:30:47,373
I could call Kári.
- Yeah, call him.

484
00:30:47,655 --> 00:30:48,804
Who is he?

485
00:30:49,175 --> 00:30:51,450
He came second
in that drag competition.

486
00:30:51,935 --> 00:30:54,085
That's just what we need,
another drag queen.

487
00:30:58,535 --> 00:30:59,570
How many more
do we need?

488
00:30:59,855 --> 00:31:01,368
Six. - No, four.

489
00:31:01,775 --> 00:31:04,130
This is Freddy and Percy.
They're going to stick with us.

490
00:31:04,735 --> 00:31:06,168
They enjoyed it so
much yesterday.

491
00:31:06,495 --> 00:31:08,133
They're both gay,
which does no harm.

492
00:31:23,655 --> 00:31:26,567
Listen, if you don't know how to
tackle, just forget about it.

493
00:31:35,575 --> 00:31:36,644
Fuck off.

494
00:31:36,975 --> 00:31:38,533
Take it easy.

495
00:31:40,215 --> 00:31:42,251
No! What are you doing?

496
00:31:44,415 --> 00:31:46,212
We've never had cards
before.

497
00:31:46,855 --> 00:31:48,254
About time.

498
00:31:51,255 --> 00:31:53,325
This is ridiculous.

499
00:31:53,735 --> 00:31:55,532
You did that on purpose, you
kicked me instead of the ball.

500
00:31:56,015 --> 00:31:57,812
Stop squabbling,
you fucking queers!

501
00:32:04,095 --> 00:32:05,653
Are you crazy, man?

502
00:32:06,495 --> 00:32:07,928
Mouth to mouth.

503
00:32:09,055 --> 00:32:10,852
Help him up.

504
00:32:13,975 --> 00:32:15,806
Take the free kick.

505
00:32:38,455 --> 00:32:39,729
Is mom home?

506
00:32:40,495 --> 00:32:42,133
She called...
- Speak up.

507
00:32:42,655 --> 00:32:46,364
She just called,
she's on the way home.

508
00:32:46,735 --> 00:32:49,249
What's going on here?
What mess is this?

509
00:32:55,735 --> 00:32:57,407
Grab your schoolbag,
come with me.

510
00:32:57,735 --> 00:32:59,009
I'm in the middle
of a game.

511
00:32:59,455 --> 00:33:01,173
I don't feel like coming.

512
00:33:02,055 --> 00:33:02,885
Have you got money?

513
00:33:02,975 --> 00:33:04,010
No.

514
00:33:06,175 --> 00:33:07,608
Buy yourself a
pizza.

515
00:33:10,095 --> 00:33:12,290
Tell your mom to call me
when she comes in.

516
00:33:19,815 --> 00:33:21,009
See you.

517
00:33:46,735 --> 00:33:48,532
"Cooking with Joey Fel"

518
00:33:48,895 --> 00:33:50,806
Aren't you going to
help me?

519
00:33:51,575 --> 00:33:53,133
I'm going to finish
watching Joey Fel

520
00:33:53,615 --> 00:33:55,014
and then go to
the club with the lads.

521
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:56,809
Really?

522
00:33:57,095 --> 00:33:58,653
I told you.

523
00:34:00,535 --> 00:34:01,934
I thought we were going
to watch Moulin Rouge...

524
00:34:02,255 --> 00:34:03,131
I've got red wine
and cheese.

525
00:34:03,215 --> 00:34:04,728
It's a Nicole Kidman theme-night.

526
00:34:05,055 --> 00:34:07,091
I'm just going to have
a beer with the lads.

527
00:34:08,375 --> 00:34:10,730
Don't drink too much,
it's a big game tomorrow.

528
00:34:11,775 --> 00:34:13,413
You sound
like my mother.

529
00:34:14,575 --> 00:34:15,371
Will you be long?

530
00:34:15,695 --> 00:34:16,764
Maybe.

531
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,806
I'm not responsible for you.

532
00:34:33,375 --> 00:34:34,410
You look a lot better.

533
00:34:34,495 --> 00:34:36,213
It's not too bad.

534
00:34:38,375 --> 00:34:41,492
I hear they're going to
trash you.

535
00:34:44,735 --> 00:34:46,248
They're not going
to give the game away...

536
00:34:46,535 --> 00:34:48,048
After that screw-up
the other day.

537
00:34:50,855 --> 00:34:52,652
It's going to be a hard game.

538
00:34:53,055 --> 00:34:54,170
Great.

539
00:34:54,895 --> 00:34:56,374
Otherwise you'll just
win the league.

540
00:34:56,775 --> 00:34:58,891
I only mention this because
you've got to control your men.

541
00:34:59,215 --> 00:35:00,409
You've got to control
those queers.

542
00:35:00,735 --> 00:35:01,884
I don't want any fights.

543
00:35:02,975 --> 00:35:05,773
This is just for the sake of
the league, you know?

544
00:35:06,135 --> 00:35:07,329
For the whole concept
of fair play...

545
00:35:07,655 --> 00:35:09,373
Just blow your fucking whistle!

546
00:35:29,135 --> 00:35:30,693
Hey, guys, let's do
another song...

547
00:35:31,015 --> 00:35:32,892
Dancing Queen
or Waterloo!

548
00:37:07,655 --> 00:37:08,849
Oh, hi son.

549
00:37:09,855 --> 00:37:10,970
Jesus Christ.
Fucking disgusting!

550
00:37:11,335 --> 00:37:13,053
Eh, get out.

551
00:37:17,015 --> 00:37:18,414
No, don't stop.

552
00:37:20,055 --> 00:37:21,727
I've got to stop.

553
00:37:42,335 --> 00:37:43,927
Hi, is Maggi here?

554
00:37:44,335 --> 00:37:47,725
Just leave him be.
What happened?

555
00:37:48,055 --> 00:37:49,647
What do you mean?
Nothing.

556
00:37:50,295 --> 00:37:53,367
He comes back here in a
fucked-up state.

557
00:37:53,815 --> 00:37:55,214
Spare me the sermon.

558
00:37:55,535 --> 00:37:57,446
What were you doing
at my parent's place...

559
00:37:57,975 --> 00:37:59,408
...Messing with me
and my affairs?

560
00:37:59,855 --> 00:38:02,289
I don't know.
It was just bullshit.

561
00:38:05,815 --> 00:38:08,124
Have you talked
to him?

562
00:38:08,735 --> 00:38:11,647
No, he doesn't talk to
me about anything.

563
00:38:12,895 --> 00:38:17,525
How's he doing at school?

564
00:38:20,295 --> 00:38:22,855
Do you want to come in?

565
00:38:49,095 --> 00:38:51,165
What do we do now?

566
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:53,611
I don't know.

567
00:38:58,535 --> 00:39:03,563
Shouldn't I get going
before the kid wakes up?

568
00:39:13,415 --> 00:39:17,886
I'm glad to see so many of
you could make it today.

569
00:39:18,375 --> 00:39:23,654
I don't think the league has
ever been as popular as

570
00:39:24,055 --> 00:39:26,888
it's been this year,
or as... diverse.

571
00:39:27,695 --> 00:39:30,732
And now I'd like to invite
Iceland's best known coach

572
00:39:31,055 --> 00:39:34,491
to draw this year's finalists.

573
00:39:35,855 --> 00:39:38,210
A warm hand please
for Victor Ingi!

574
00:39:49,455 --> 00:39:50,808
Is this the hat?

575
00:39:51,135 --> 00:39:53,251
I'm sure you have something
snazzier in your division,

576
00:39:53,575 --> 00:39:55,566
but this is good enough
for us amateurs.

577
00:39:56,015 --> 00:40:03,091
The first team out of the hat...
Pride United, the faggots.

578
00:40:07,175 --> 00:40:12,203
They'll be playing the
Fish Factory from Raufarhöfn.

579
00:40:13,055 --> 00:40:14,170
Where the hell is Raufarhöfn?

580
00:40:14,775 --> 00:40:16,413
Are you a moron?
In the east.

581
00:40:16,815 --> 00:40:18,453
How am I
supposed to know?

582
00:40:18,775 --> 00:40:20,128
Isn't that miles away?

583
00:40:20,615 --> 00:40:22,207
Yeah, but they're
an easy team,

584
00:40:22,615 --> 00:40:23,809
we've got a real chance
to make it to the final.

585
00:40:24,575 --> 00:40:25,690
This is great, guys.

586
00:40:26,135 --> 00:40:29,207
We're going into the
country to play football,

587
00:40:30,135 --> 00:40:32,046
it'll be great fun.

588
00:40:32,735 --> 00:40:34,691
Who cares if we know
nothing about Raufarhöfn?

589
00:40:35,615 --> 00:40:37,526
Scoring goals is what matters.

590
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,812
It's all about scoring
more goals than the enemy.

591
00:40:40,335 --> 00:40:42,053
I'd also like to tell you
that we've finally got

592
00:40:42,375 --> 00:40:46,368
a website up at
www.amateurleague.is

593
00:40:48,655 --> 00:40:52,489
with all the classifications
and everything.

594
00:40:54,015 --> 00:40:59,453
Let's give the designer a hand.
Thanks, Goggi.

595
00:41:05,975 --> 00:41:08,614
Are you sure
about this rehab?

596
00:41:14,535 --> 00:41:16,685
Listen, about,
you know...

597
00:41:20,575 --> 00:41:23,135
We don't have to talk about it.

598
00:41:23,615 --> 00:41:30,566
We were drunk, that's all.
It's time I sorted myself out,

599
00:41:31,335 --> 00:41:35,647
I must be hitting
rock bottom

600
00:41:35,935 --> 00:41:38,813
if I'm sleeping
around with gay men.

601
00:42:07,575 --> 00:42:13,844
Shit. This is a shock.
I was going to cook.

602
00:42:18,615 --> 00:42:20,571
It's a theme-night,
I rented a Mexican movie,

603
00:42:20,815 --> 00:42:21,611
I've got wine and...

604
00:42:22,015 --> 00:42:24,290
Maybe the theme-nights
aren't working out.

605
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:28,092
Titanic wasn't my idea
of a great night.

606
00:42:29,975 --> 00:42:32,330
Is that what's
bothering you?

607
00:42:33,575 --> 00:42:36,009
They're meant to be
fun nights.

608
00:42:36,775 --> 00:42:39,243
No, that's not it.

609
00:42:40,295 --> 00:42:42,172
Isn't your wife still giving
you blow jobs?

610
00:42:42,535 --> 00:42:44,526
Still? It happened once,
by accident,

611
00:42:45,455 --> 00:42:47,411
I was drunk, you know what
I'm like then,

612
00:42:47,775 --> 00:42:49,003
I'll do anyone.

613
00:42:49,375 --> 00:42:51,570
You know what I'm like.
You know how I feel...

614
00:42:52,015 --> 00:42:53,846
Just relax a minute, let go...

615
00:42:54,895 --> 00:42:57,090
This isn't exactly what I'm
looking for right now.

616
00:42:57,495 --> 00:42:59,292
I'll cook us a meal,
we'll have some wine.

617
00:42:59,615 --> 00:43:00,809
Let's talk this over.

618
00:43:01,135 --> 00:43:02,932
Come on.
We can still be friends.

619
00:43:03,295 --> 00:43:05,650
Go clubbing
and meet at practice.

620
00:43:06,015 --> 00:43:07,289
Don't be like this.
It's over.

621
00:43:07,615 --> 00:43:10,083
Relax, just relax,
let me suck you off.

622
00:43:10,935 --> 00:43:15,804
Ottar, come on!
You're just feeling horny.

623
00:43:16,735 --> 00:43:18,646
Watch the movie and
jerk off.

624
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:21,649
Don't do this to me.
Don't walk out on me.

625
00:43:22,735 --> 00:43:25,090
You know how I feel about you,
I'm fond of you.

626
00:43:25,615 --> 00:43:27,207
Yeah, I know.
I'm fond of you too.

627
00:43:27,935 --> 00:43:29,288
Yeah, but I love you or...

628
00:43:29,695 --> 00:43:31,845
...or I'm really
fond of you.

629
00:43:32,255 --> 00:43:36,043
We're over.
Let's just leave it at that.

630
00:43:36,375 --> 00:43:38,206
What, bang bang, thanks
and it's over?

631
00:43:38,655 --> 00:43:42,728
Sorry, don't take it so personally.
I'll see you at practice.

632
00:43:52,575 --> 00:43:54,213
I'd like to start off by pointing
out some of the landscape.

633
00:43:59,375 --> 00:44:01,935
Look at those
big blue mountains...

634
00:44:02,215 --> 00:44:04,445
Enormous!

635
00:44:53,055 --> 00:44:55,615
The game starts in an hour.

636
00:45:14,415 --> 00:45:16,531
Where is the pitch?

637
00:45:18,895 --> 00:45:20,806
The trawler won't be coming
in for two hours.

638
00:45:21,255 --> 00:45:22,813
Two hours?

639
00:45:23,815 --> 00:45:26,249
Half the team is
on that trawler.

640
00:45:27,055 --> 00:45:29,364
We've got two hours to go.
- To what?

641
00:45:29,975 --> 00:45:31,488
The game.

642
00:45:33,095 --> 00:45:36,485
Jesus Christ! Celebrity corner.

643
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:37,844
Strike a pose.

644
00:45:38,255 --> 00:45:39,847
Gay soccer star finally
comes out of the closet.

645
00:45:40,175 --> 00:45:42,484
In-depth interview with Ottar
and loads of pictures.

646
00:45:42,775 --> 00:45:44,003
Has that fucking rag come out?

647
00:45:44,255 --> 00:45:45,654
Don't flash that
around here, pal.

648
00:45:46,175 --> 00:45:49,929
"Still looking for Mr. Right."
Are you blind?

649
00:45:52,895 --> 00:45:56,331
Says he likes Bruce Springsteen,
especially the early stuff.

650
00:45:56,615 --> 00:45:57,934
Are you sure you're gay?

651
00:46:01,495 --> 00:46:04,089
What pages are the photos on?
- Pages 20-24.

652
00:46:11,455 --> 00:46:12,365
Now all hell's
going to break lose.

653
00:46:12,455 --> 00:46:14,844
It's just one interview, come on.

654
00:46:16,815 --> 00:46:19,966
Crappy weather.
It's been terrible all morning.

655
00:46:20,215 --> 00:46:21,933
Bloody typical.

656
00:46:22,855 --> 00:46:25,244
But they say it'll change later on,
wait and see...

657
00:46:25,815 --> 00:46:28,488
How's the weather down south?
- Fine.

658
00:46:30,455 --> 00:46:32,047
Isn't the trawler
coming in soon?

659
00:46:32,375 --> 00:46:33,490
Yeah, everyone's really excited.

660
00:46:33,815 --> 00:46:35,692
There's a car waiting for them
at the harbour.

661
00:46:35,975 --> 00:46:38,045
Are your lads in good shape?
- Yeah.

662
00:46:38,495 --> 00:46:40,850
I'll open up the centre.
You can get changed in there.

663
00:46:42,415 --> 00:46:43,928
Come on, get a move on.

664
00:46:48,335 --> 00:46:51,771
Take your shoes off,
there's a rack in there.

665
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:14,491
Has your dad been gay
for long then?

666
00:47:15,015 --> 00:47:17,449
Dunno, not that long.

667
00:47:23,375 --> 00:47:26,572
We've got a gay in the village.

668
00:47:33,015 --> 00:47:38,692
He's cool and no-one ever
disses him.

669
00:47:42,415 --> 00:47:46,010
Except when they're
telling gay jokes.

670
00:47:55,015 --> 00:47:56,767
Do you want to fuck?

671
00:47:57,535 --> 00:48:00,925
I'm not sure... Or...

672
00:48:02,935 --> 00:48:04,926
There's not much else
to do around here.

673
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,489
Oh, really?

674
00:48:20,695 --> 00:48:22,925
So tell me,
are you all queer?

675
00:48:23,255 --> 00:48:24,574
This is the queer team
from Reykjavik.

676
00:48:24,655 --> 00:48:26,407
Don't you know us?

677
00:48:29,095 --> 00:48:31,051
So are you
a lesbian?

678
00:48:31,415 --> 00:48:33,690
We're married.
We're just helping the lads.

679
00:48:34,055 --> 00:48:36,728
They play the game,
we shout from the sidelines.

680
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:42,884
That's neat. We're pretty
liberal here in Raufarhöfn.

681
00:48:43,415 --> 00:48:46,725
There's even a multi-cultural
community centre.

682
00:48:47,935 --> 00:48:49,084
My wife is from Cambodia.

683
00:48:49,415 --> 00:48:50,734
So she's "Cambodian"
but not "lesbian".

684
00:48:51,335 --> 00:48:52,609
Good one.

685
00:48:53,175 --> 00:48:55,735
And then of course there's Lárus,
the engineer. He's queer.

686
00:48:56,175 --> 00:48:58,894
There's not much happening
for him and his gay life,

687
00:48:59,255 --> 00:49:01,086
being the only gay in the village,

688
00:49:01,415 --> 00:49:04,213
since that Pole
quit at the freezing plant.

689
00:49:04,815 --> 00:49:07,454
He's going to be happy
to see you guys.

690
00:49:11,495 --> 00:49:12,848
Hi guys, coffee is ready.

691
00:49:13,335 --> 00:49:15,326
That's my woman.
What do you make of her?

692
00:49:19,335 --> 00:49:21,530
Ok, that's enough, woman.
Stop that.

693
00:49:25,655 --> 00:49:27,646
Where are you now?

694
00:49:27,975 --> 00:49:30,853
Pulling into harbour?
No, I'm up at the centre.

695
00:49:31,215 --> 00:49:33,410
Sigga's serving the
homosexuals coffee.

696
00:49:34,695 --> 00:49:39,894
I see, could you drop Lárus off?
No, right you are.

697
00:49:43,495 --> 00:49:45,008
The fishing's been
really great,

698
00:49:45,375 --> 00:49:46,728
they decided to
keep on fishing.

699
00:49:47,055 --> 00:49:48,534
Meaning what?

700
00:49:50,055 --> 00:49:51,966
Can't we just call it a draw?

701
00:49:53,775 --> 00:49:56,050
We're taking three points.
Those are the rules.

702
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:57,968
We get three points,
that's how it works.

703
00:49:58,255 --> 00:49:59,404
You don't say.

704
00:49:59,735 --> 00:50:01,009
Those are the rules.

705
00:50:01,295 --> 00:50:02,694
So be it.

706
00:50:03,335 --> 00:50:05,724
Shall we head down
to the pub? To Café Cambodia.

707
00:50:06,055 --> 00:50:07,329
Is there a
cocktail bar here?

708
00:50:07,815 --> 00:50:09,407
Come on, lads,
let's get plastered!

709
00:50:09,895 --> 00:50:11,886
The wife runs a little café.

710
00:50:12,295 --> 00:50:13,967
We even have an accordion
player on weekends...

711
00:50:14,335 --> 00:50:16,053
...but he broke his arm recently,
poor thing.

712
00:50:18,175 --> 00:50:19,847
Down to the pub, lads!

713
00:50:20,375 --> 00:50:22,286
I want to hear about the
goal you scored against Arsenal.

714
00:50:30,495 --> 00:50:32,531
Can I talk to you for a second?

715
00:50:33,055 --> 00:50:34,613
Not now, man, later.

716
00:50:35,455 --> 00:50:36,649
Don't be like this, talk to me.

717
00:50:37,095 --> 00:50:38,733
Not now.

718
00:50:40,215 --> 00:50:42,092
Haven't you got
a game to play?

719
00:50:42,415 --> 00:50:44,212
It was called off.

720
00:50:44,855 --> 00:50:46,573
So what's happening?

721
00:50:47,055 --> 00:50:48,283
We're going down
to some bar or pub.

722
00:50:48,655 --> 00:50:51,613
Café Cambodia.
- Yeah, my mom's place.

723
00:50:51,975 --> 00:50:53,328
You go ahead
and we'll join you

724
00:50:53,775 --> 00:50:55,572
once I've shown him
the sights.

725
00:50:59,975 --> 00:51:03,524
Yeah, we'll see you
down there! Okay.

726
00:51:41,135 --> 00:51:42,932
Maggi.

727
00:51:46,335 --> 00:51:48,007
Why are you acting like this?
- What do you mean?

728
00:51:48,295 --> 00:51:50,331
What's going on with you?
- Cool it, man!

729
00:51:51,055 --> 00:51:52,329
I'm talking to him.

730
00:51:52,695 --> 00:51:54,287
I'm just showing him the place.
- Where are you going?

731
00:51:54,615 --> 00:51:55,843
To my bedroom, relax.
- To do what?

732
00:51:56,375 --> 00:51:58,411
Just chill-out, man.
Will you be long?

733
00:51:58,655 --> 00:51:59,565
No.

734
00:54:02,935 --> 00:54:05,051
We've got to fix this
fucking mess.

735
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:06,451
Castrate him.

736
00:54:06,775 --> 00:54:09,209
Shut up. I'm
doing the talking here.

737
00:54:11,015 --> 00:54:13,734
Yeah, I've tried talking to
the lad. It's no use.

738
00:54:14,095 --> 00:54:15,608
I even got Ási, the
shrink, involved.

739
00:54:15,935 --> 00:54:17,368
Ási is a wimp.

740
00:54:17,655 --> 00:54:19,088
What's the problem?
Does he want a raise?

741
00:54:20,095 --> 00:54:21,813
Don't give me that.

742
00:54:22,855 --> 00:54:27,485
We should have a non-gay
clause in all future contracts...

743
00:54:29,255 --> 00:54:32,088
Something on paper
to confirm they have a wife.

744
00:54:35,175 --> 00:54:38,087
Should we stick an asshole
clause into your contract too?

745
00:54:39,095 --> 00:54:41,131
My contract?
What do you mean?

746
00:54:41,495 --> 00:54:42,814
You know people talk
about you in the club.

747
00:54:43,135 --> 00:54:44,488
Some girls in the junior
league have started to...

748
00:54:44,815 --> 00:54:46,612
Now come on, guys!

749
00:54:47,615 --> 00:54:49,731
We have to put a lid on this.

750
00:54:53,615 --> 00:54:56,209
Remember the famous jockey
and his horse?

751
00:54:56,655 --> 00:54:59,044
They managed to cover that up.

752
00:55:05,855 --> 00:55:08,415
He makes us look like a bunch
of idiots.

753
00:55:09,175 --> 00:55:12,884
Not necessarily. There's
no such thing as bad publicity.

754
00:55:14,135 --> 00:55:19,163
Is your brain switched off? I want
him back on the fucking team!

755
00:55:58,815 --> 00:56:01,693
Listen, is it alright if Maggi
stays with you for a few days?

756
00:56:02,375 --> 00:56:03,603
Gugga got a place.

757
00:56:03,935 --> 00:56:05,971
Is she going into rehab?

758
00:56:06,335 --> 00:56:07,563
That's great.

759
00:56:08,055 --> 00:56:11,730
Dad's out of the closet and
mom is in rehab, great parenting.

760
00:56:12,055 --> 00:56:13,329
Can he stay here or not?

761
00:56:13,695 --> 00:56:16,209
Yeah, the boy better
stay with his uncle for a while.

762
00:56:18,015 --> 00:56:21,894
We can watch Barfly and even
Philadelphia when dad returns it.

763
00:56:23,575 --> 00:56:25,327
Listen, thanks.

764
00:56:26,895 --> 00:56:32,686
When are they releasing her
or whatever it's called?

765
00:56:33,455 --> 00:56:35,286
In a few days, I think.

766
00:56:35,775 --> 00:56:39,484
The kid needs a break
from all this gay shit.

767
00:56:41,175 --> 00:56:43,211
I know
where he's coming from.

768
00:56:47,975 --> 00:56:49,852
Maybe I'll even manage to nudge
him out of the closet.

769
00:56:49,935 --> 00:56:51,653
Only joking!

770
00:56:52,135 --> 00:56:53,488
You take care of
of the drunken bitch

771
00:56:53,935 --> 00:56:56,369
and I'll take care of the
lad here. Case closed.

772
00:56:59,175 --> 00:57:03,373
"He ain't heavy, he's my
brother." Strong words, I know...

773
00:57:05,335 --> 00:57:07,326
...but I mean it.

774
00:57:07,855 --> 00:57:09,766
Fucking jerk.

775
00:57:12,015 --> 00:57:15,007
Listen, I owe you one.
I'll see you, okay?

776
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:20,964
Maggi, want a Coke?

777
00:57:21,335 --> 00:57:22,324
What the fuck.

778
00:57:22,695 --> 00:57:26,210
That'll cost 150kr.
A can of coke costs 150kr.

779
00:57:26,575 --> 00:57:28,008
You know where the
kiddie movies are.

780
00:57:28,335 --> 00:57:29,768
We have rules in here, boy.

781
00:57:38,895 --> 00:57:41,967
Are you his dad?
We've managed to corner him.

782
00:57:43,175 --> 00:57:45,814
He's wild, he's been
shouting about Raufarhöfn.

783
00:57:46,135 --> 00:57:48,091
Is that where he was heading?

784
00:57:49,655 --> 00:57:51,293
He doesn't have a
driving license, does he?

785
00:57:52,255 --> 00:57:54,769
No, the dude is only thirteen.
Of course he can't drive.

786
00:57:55,135 --> 00:57:57,205
He doesn't even have
any hair on his balls!

787
00:57:57,895 --> 00:58:00,284
Do you own that jeep he's in?
- The Terrano Playstation?

788
00:58:00,975 --> 00:58:03,250
Yeah, it's a fucking
pimped-up ride!

789
00:58:03,975 --> 00:58:06,205
Take it for a spin
if the kid doesn't fuck it up.

790
00:58:07,095 --> 00:58:09,655
Who gave him the alcohol?
- Was he drunk too?

791
00:58:09,975 --> 00:58:10,964
Yes, I think so.

792
00:58:11,295 --> 00:58:12,410
He couldn't have been drunk.

793
00:58:12,735 --> 00:58:14,612
I gave him one or two beers
at the most.

794
00:58:15,815 --> 00:58:19,854
It's better than the giant
nugget of hash he had.

795
00:58:20,175 --> 00:58:21,528
I frisked the dude
and took it.

796
00:58:21,975 --> 00:58:23,533
I confiscated it!

797
00:58:23,935 --> 00:58:25,607
The hash?
Do you have it now?

798
00:58:26,055 --> 00:58:28,285
Why, are you going to search
me with an anal-intruder?

799
00:58:28,615 --> 00:58:29,889
I threw it away.

800
00:58:32,135 --> 00:58:33,966
They've just
arrested the kid.

801
00:58:34,575 --> 00:58:35,974
Jesus, what have you done?

802
00:58:36,295 --> 00:58:37,045
Are you talking to me?

803
00:58:37,335 --> 00:58:38,290
This is your fault!
- I didn't do this.

804
00:58:38,775 --> 00:58:39,605
Sure you did!

805
00:58:39,935 --> 00:58:41,084
You got him drunk and
lent him your car, you idiot.

806
00:58:41,415 --> 00:58:42,291
That' s not true.

807
00:58:42,815 --> 00:58:43,565
You said so.

808
00:58:43,895 --> 00:58:45,123
Shut up. That's not true.

809
00:58:45,535 --> 00:58:46,888
Look at the fucking jeep.
See what he's done!

810
00:58:51,575 --> 00:58:53,372
Isn't it fucking insured?

811
00:58:53,815 --> 00:58:55,806
You know what that
bitch is like.

812
00:58:56,135 --> 00:58:57,614
The bloody whore
was going to do it.

813
00:58:58,095 --> 00:59:00,928
They can never do anything
right, these cunts.

814
00:59:05,255 --> 00:59:07,325
I don't even have
a driving license.

815
00:59:07,855 --> 00:59:09,652
Hang on, you don't have
a license?

816
00:59:10,175 --> 00:59:11,767
I can drive and stuff.

817
00:59:12,495 --> 00:59:14,770
Those guys from the insurance
companies, they're insane!

818
00:59:15,135 --> 00:59:16,170
Hey, what's your name?
- Who?

819
00:59:16,495 --> 00:59:18,884
You. What's your name and
social security number?

820
00:59:19,295 --> 00:59:20,694
Let's get going,
come on, Ottar.

821
00:59:35,695 --> 00:59:37,845
Guys, what the hell were
you thinking out there?

822
00:59:38,295 --> 00:59:39,967
The offence was in shambles.

823
00:59:41,375 --> 00:59:43,684
Where was Ottar?

824
00:59:44,375 --> 00:59:46,127
Though Ottar
didn't turn up, that's no excuse...

825
00:59:46,455 --> 00:59:47,808
...you played like
a bunch of morons.

826
00:59:48,095 --> 00:59:49,972
Where the hell was he?
- I don't know.

827
00:59:50,735 --> 00:59:52,373
It's impossible without him.

828
00:59:52,775 --> 00:59:53,844
I doesn't matter, I mean
you can't stop being a team

829
00:59:54,335 --> 00:59:55,814
just because he doesn't show.

830
00:59:59,295 --> 01:00:02,844
Guys, we're not in
junior league.

831
01:00:03,255 --> 01:00:04,529
No, worse,
the amateur league.

832
01:00:04,775 --> 01:00:06,288
Seriously, guys.

833
01:00:08,055 --> 01:00:09,454
If you're going to play
in my team

834
01:00:09,935 --> 01:00:11,812
you do what I say.

835
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:14,413
I'm sick and tired of all
you prima donnas.

836
01:00:14,975 --> 01:00:17,409
There's only one
star in this team and that's me.

837
01:00:17,775 --> 01:00:18,525
Shut up!

838
01:00:18,895 --> 01:00:20,692
Why are you always
so nasty to me?

839
01:00:26,055 --> 01:00:28,171
Relax! Brósi!
What are you doing?

840
01:00:28,935 --> 01:00:32,291
I've had enough of this crap!
Maybe we should quit.

841
01:00:32,535 --> 01:00:34,127
Don't say that.

842
01:00:34,535 --> 01:00:37,174
I know we're all gay, but that was
never the point for me.

843
01:00:37,535 --> 01:00:39,173
This isn't some kind of
a gay activist team.

844
01:00:39,495 --> 01:00:41,213
I wanted to play football.

845
01:00:41,975 --> 01:00:43,727
Let's not get bogged
down by politics,

846
01:00:44,455 --> 01:00:47,367
this is about team spirit,
the team as a whole.

847
01:00:47,655 --> 01:00:49,168
A man, a ball.

848
01:00:49,815 --> 01:00:51,453
Yeah, I want
to play football.

849
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:53,812
Do you know
what makes us a team?

850
01:00:55,135 --> 01:00:58,013
It's the fact that we're all gay.

851
01:00:59,295 --> 01:01:00,011
No.

852
01:01:00,415 --> 01:01:01,609
That's what unites us.

853
01:01:01,975 --> 01:01:05,604
Fucking faggots.
Yeah, you fucking faggots.

854
01:01:06,695 --> 01:01:07,923
I'm sorry.

855
01:01:20,775 --> 01:01:22,094
Leave me alone!

856
01:01:22,615 --> 01:01:24,014
Open the door, son.

857
01:01:24,255 --> 01:01:25,370
Piss off!

858
01:01:25,735 --> 01:01:27,088
Darling, open the door
and talk to us.

859
01:01:27,415 --> 01:01:28,404
Fucking drunk!

860
01:01:29,095 --> 01:01:31,006
Open the door now.
- Fucking fag!

861
01:01:32,455 --> 01:01:37,688
Just leave him be for a bit.
Do you want some coffee?

862
01:02:05,255 --> 01:02:08,167
This is for Maggi,
tell him it's from me.

863
01:02:08,535 --> 01:02:10,969
Might cheer him up
in these dark ages.

864
01:02:11,695 --> 01:02:12,844
Will do.

865
01:02:16,335 --> 01:02:18,724
Do you think you
could pop over tonight?

866
01:02:18,975 --> 01:02:20,488
What for?

867
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:23,168
For your mom's sake.

868
01:02:23,535 --> 01:02:24,809
What about her?

869
01:02:27,295 --> 01:02:29,206
She's dying.

870
01:02:32,615 --> 01:02:34,924
Yeah, we didn't want
to say anything at first...

871
01:02:35,415 --> 01:02:38,134
...she's had some tests.
She doesn't have much left.

872
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:42,726
I don't believe it.

873
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:46,126
She doesn't want to talk about it.

874
01:02:46,495 --> 01:02:47,848
Your mother is a very
private person.

875
01:02:48,895 --> 01:02:50,647
This is just between
you and me.

876
01:02:50,935 --> 01:02:51,845
Understood?

877
01:02:55,735 --> 01:02:58,408
What's wrong with her?

878
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:00,925
It's something...

879
01:03:04,175 --> 01:03:06,973
...something incurable.

880
01:03:13,495 --> 01:03:16,328
He didn't return the tape.

881
01:03:17,135 --> 01:03:18,966
So last night I
knocked on his door...

882
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:21,650
Hi, there. Have a seat.

883
01:03:23,815 --> 01:03:25,885
Nice article in the magazine.
- Shut up!

884
01:03:36,415 --> 01:03:37,689
Let me do that, darling.

885
01:03:38,135 --> 01:03:41,605
Sit down.
No need to strain yourself.

886
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:57,888
No thanks, not for me...
- Shut up, eat.

887
01:04:10,015 --> 01:04:15,328
Son, maybe the issue
isn't so much that you're...

888
01:04:18,935 --> 01:04:21,051
Gay, just say it.

889
01:04:25,295 --> 01:04:29,493
Don't you think you should
forget all that nonsense?

890
01:04:30,415 --> 01:04:39,164
I am your father,
they're laughing at me in KR.

891
01:04:53,695 --> 01:04:57,244
Look at your mother,
see what it's doing to her.

892
01:04:57,655 --> 01:05:00,089
What are you talking about?
- Nothing to do with you, woman.

893
01:05:00,455 --> 01:05:01,683
This is between
Ottar and myself.

894
01:05:02,055 --> 01:05:03,966
I'm only here for her. I haven't
come to listen to you.

895
01:05:04,295 --> 01:05:05,774
Just relax.
- Shut up.

896
01:05:06,255 --> 01:05:08,530
All of us here
care about you, Ottar.

897
01:05:10,095 --> 01:05:12,973
Me, your brother Orri, Aµsi
the shrink here, your mother...

898
01:05:14,855 --> 01:05:16,254
who, thanks to you,

899
01:05:16,695 --> 01:05:18,970
has become the laughing stock
of the KR women.

900
01:05:19,295 --> 01:05:21,490
Yet she's still here.

901
01:05:21,855 --> 01:05:24,494
She loves you.
- Yes, as we all do.

902
01:05:24,895 --> 01:05:27,011
Shut up, I do the talking
in my house.

903
01:05:27,415 --> 01:05:28,530
I'm not here
because of you.

904
01:05:28,855 --> 01:05:30,573
I'm here because
mom is sick.

905
01:05:30,815 --> 01:05:32,248
What have you
told him?

906
01:05:32,615 --> 01:05:33,604
I told him that...

907
01:05:33,695 --> 01:05:35,287
That you were dying.

908
01:05:35,655 --> 01:05:37,327
I only had a wart removed
from my foot.

909
01:05:37,655 --> 01:05:38,770
It could
have gone badly.

910
01:05:39,415 --> 01:05:42,134
Could I have a word with
you in the kitchen?

911
01:05:55,335 --> 01:05:57,451
What madness is this?

912
01:06:00,055 --> 01:06:05,083
Your dad is a bit eccentric,
he asked me to come here and...

913
01:06:05,415 --> 01:06:07,292
Don't be talking shit about
my dad, okay?

914
01:06:07,655 --> 01:06:09,611
Orri, take it easy.

915
01:06:10,615 --> 01:06:12,651
I can't take any more of this,
I'm out of here.

916
01:06:12,935 --> 01:06:14,288
Are you coming?

917
01:06:14,695 --> 01:06:16,287
I'll hang around
here for a bit.

918
01:06:16,575 --> 01:06:19,169
Finish eating,
make sure everything is okay.

919
01:06:19,455 --> 01:06:21,650
Come and have a word with me.

920
01:06:28,615 --> 01:06:30,128
Why are you always
so nasty?

921
01:06:30,415 --> 01:06:31,768
Shut up.

922
01:06:32,415 --> 01:06:33,643
Orri?

923
01:06:35,535 --> 01:06:38,766
Jesus, domestic violence!

924
01:06:40,255 --> 01:06:42,894
He's getting too cocky.

925
01:06:44,295 --> 01:06:46,525
Does he expect us to play
against a team of faggots?

926
01:06:46,855 --> 01:06:48,208
I was there and that
was the conclusion.

927
01:06:48,495 --> 01:06:49,484
Yeah, on our pitch,
one game

928
01:06:49,775 --> 01:06:51,333
and then he'll sign
the contract.

929
01:06:51,815 --> 01:06:53,487
Over my dead body!

930
01:06:53,895 --> 01:06:56,045
Look, this doesn't
have to be a problem.

931
01:06:56,415 --> 01:06:57,894
And you say they suck?

932
01:06:58,175 --> 01:07:00,689
Of course, they suck.
What is this shit?

933
01:07:02,055 --> 01:07:04,205
If you go ahead with this I quit.

934
01:07:04,535 --> 01:07:06,810
This could be good PR.

935
01:07:07,775 --> 01:07:10,494
Picture the headline
KR supports repressed minority.

936
01:07:10,935 --> 01:07:12,573
We're not going to
advertise this shit.

937
01:07:13,015 --> 01:07:15,529
Guys, we'll make it
look like a practice game.

938
01:07:16,455 --> 01:07:17,524
Are you serious?

939
01:07:17,855 --> 01:07:19,686
Shut up.
It's my club, not yours.

940
01:07:21,895 --> 01:07:26,889
August 16th, Pride United
versus KR on the KR pitch.

941
01:07:31,735 --> 01:07:33,248
We're playing KR.

942
01:07:34,295 --> 01:07:35,967
Hang on, where's the catch?

943
01:07:36,935 --> 01:07:38,732
What do you mean?

944
01:07:40,535 --> 01:07:42,253
Just think of what this game
can do for gay rights...

945
01:07:42,735 --> 01:07:45,044
I'm not about to embark on some
bullshit crusade here!

946
01:07:45,375 --> 01:07:47,013
We're going to play KR.

947
01:07:47,375 --> 01:07:49,525
I've said this so often,
I'm no activist.

948
01:07:50,095 --> 01:07:51,210
That's not what
this is about, guys.

949
01:07:51,495 --> 01:07:53,326
Let's no get bogged down
by politics here.

950
01:07:53,735 --> 01:07:56,249
Are we ready
to play a top team like KR?

951
01:07:57,335 --> 01:07:59,644
This is about football!

952
01:08:00,495 --> 01:08:02,326
Lt'll be fun, it'll be fun!

953
01:08:02,975 --> 01:08:06,729
Here's to us, lads! Cheers!
To Ottar!

954
01:08:10,255 --> 01:08:12,052
Gay United, wow!

955
01:08:13,175 --> 01:08:15,450
Let us in, we want
to talk to the board...

956
01:08:16,215 --> 01:08:17,489
...they're trying to change
KR into some kind of

957
01:08:17,815 --> 01:08:18,691
gender-bender club.

958
01:08:19,015 --> 01:08:21,006
I want to talk to him - now.

959
01:08:23,895 --> 01:08:25,806
We'll get more seats in.

960
01:08:26,135 --> 01:08:28,933
Call you back in five.
What's going on out there?

961
01:08:29,615 --> 01:08:31,014
It's because of tomorrow's game,

962
01:08:31,375 --> 01:08:34,367
people are upset by the gay
aspect of the game.

963
01:08:36,495 --> 01:08:39,453
No, enough of this,
the game is cancelled!

964
01:08:39,815 --> 01:08:41,771
It's not that simple.
- Why not?

965
01:08:42,295 --> 01:08:45,014
The game is sold out.
They're going wild.

966
01:08:45,695 --> 01:08:48,493
Stebbi says we've broken
all box-office records.

967
01:08:51,735 --> 01:08:53,646
There are twenty or thirty
thousand gays on the march,

968
01:08:53,975 --> 01:08:55,090
and they're all coming.

969
01:08:55,975 --> 01:08:57,090
What march?

970
01:08:57,415 --> 01:08:59,724
It's gay pride day
tomorrow, Björgvin.

971
01:09:00,415 --> 01:09:02,690
Faggots and lesbians are
marching across town.

972
01:09:05,815 --> 01:09:07,407
I'm putting
an end to this.

973
01:09:08,375 --> 01:09:13,733
You can't do that,
the media will fuck us.

974
01:09:23,055 --> 01:09:24,647
Is he ready?

975
01:09:25,855 --> 01:09:28,688
He refuses to come out,
he's locked himself in.

976
01:09:29,055 --> 01:09:31,330
Isn't he coming with me?

977
01:09:35,095 --> 01:09:37,086
Maggi, are you OK?

978
01:09:38,735 --> 01:09:42,045
He put a lock on his door,
I didn't want to interfere.

979
01:09:42,495 --> 01:09:44,804
He's got a
girlfriend and stuff.

980
01:09:45,695 --> 01:09:48,493
Maggi, don't do this to me.
I've got no time for this.

981
01:10:15,095 --> 01:10:17,325
I thought we were all
supposed to tog out?

982
01:10:17,655 --> 01:10:19,725
You've got to be in drag,
it's gay pride.

983
01:10:20,055 --> 01:10:21,283
It's all about pride, baby.

984
01:10:21,815 --> 01:10:25,285
I understand but we decided
to be a team.

985
01:10:25,655 --> 01:10:28,328
Oh, don't be a square.
Give us a break.

986
01:10:28,615 --> 01:10:29,843
That's what we decided.

987
01:10:30,175 --> 01:10:31,574
Just walk out there, be proud,
be gay and have fun.

988
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:33,533
You'll be the
only one in a costume.

989
01:10:34,455 --> 01:10:35,774
No, we're all in costumes.

990
01:10:37,015 --> 01:10:38,289
Let's hope the weather holds.

991
01:10:38,655 --> 01:10:40,373
They expect some precipitation
in the afternoon.

992
01:10:41,215 --> 01:10:43,683
Some wetness.
- You mean rain?

993
01:10:44,055 --> 01:10:44,965
That's what the
weatherman said...

994
01:10:45,055 --> 01:10:46,249
Shut up, dad.

995
01:10:46,615 --> 01:10:47,968
Are you coming on the march?

996
01:10:48,295 --> 01:10:49,364
Downtown?

997
01:10:49,695 --> 01:10:51,686
Of course
they're coming.

998
01:10:52,895 --> 01:10:54,089
Are there gays
in Cambodia?

999
01:10:54,695 --> 01:10:55,969
No, it's forbidden.

1000
01:10:56,335 --> 01:10:57,734
It isn't legal at any rate.

1001
01:10:58,135 --> 01:10:59,773
Get up, Eiríkur.

1002
01:11:01,735 --> 01:11:03,691
I'm not feeling too good.

1003
01:11:04,095 --> 01:11:06,051
Eiríkur Gudmundsson, get
out of that bed this minute!

1004
01:11:06,695 --> 01:11:09,050
You are going to watch your
son play football!

1005
01:11:09,735 --> 01:11:11,646
No-one has had to drag you to
a game before.

1006
01:11:12,215 --> 01:11:14,126
This is different.

1007
01:11:16,535 --> 01:11:19,095
He's playing with
a bunch of faggots.

1008
01:11:20,095 --> 01:11:22,165
What's wrong, son?

1009
01:11:23,895 --> 01:11:26,614
You're the one who's
driving everyone crazy.

1010
01:11:30,535 --> 01:11:32,332
There's been a lot going on.

1011
01:11:33,855 --> 01:11:35,652
I hardly even
know you anymore.

1012
01:11:35,975 --> 01:11:37,852
Don't give me that,
I'm your dad.

1013
01:11:38,255 --> 01:11:40,530
Yes, he is, he even
had a blood test.

1014
01:11:43,895 --> 01:11:45,169
Who's this?

1015
01:11:45,455 --> 01:11:47,173
That's his girlfriend.
- Mom!

1016
01:11:47,495 --> 01:11:50,805
That's your girlfriend.
Isn't her name Rósa?

1017
01:11:51,495 --> 01:11:53,406
Rósa from Raufarhöfn?
She's cute.

1018
01:11:54,535 --> 01:11:55,809
Yeah, cute Rósa.

1019
01:11:56,055 --> 01:11:57,374
I don't want to talk about it.

1020
01:11:57,855 --> 01:11:59,447
Are you still pissed
about that interview?

1021
01:11:59,775 --> 01:12:00,810
Of course I am.

1022
01:12:01,175 --> 01:12:02,767
You should hear
the slagging I get.

1023
01:12:03,095 --> 01:12:04,813
Everyone knows about it,
it was on the cover!

1024
01:12:10,335 --> 01:12:12,132
It's not that I hate gays,

1025
01:12:14,375 --> 01:12:16,730
I don't see why you
make such a big deal of it.

1026
01:12:17,015 --> 01:12:18,846
You went over the top.

1027
01:12:20,295 --> 01:12:22,889
I suppose I did,
I'll give you that.

1028
01:12:26,015 --> 01:12:28,529
Aren't kids more hip about
these things today?

1029
01:12:28,815 --> 01:12:30,965
Yeah, equal rights and all that?

1030
01:12:34,935 --> 01:12:39,372
I made a mess, but at least
your mom's still a Miss Iceland.

1031
01:12:40,615 --> 01:12:42,367
Your friends must think
that's cool.

1032
01:12:42,695 --> 01:12:44,128
No, well, maybe.

1033
01:12:44,575 --> 01:12:46,725
Raggi and the lads are
always talking about her.

1034
01:12:47,135 --> 01:12:50,605
That's not enough, you
can't solve it that easily.

1035
01:12:55,055 --> 01:12:56,852
And now you've
got a girlfriend too.

1036
01:12:57,215 --> 01:12:58,330
A girlfriend in secondary school,
that's cool,

1037
01:12:58,695 --> 01:13:00,765
no matter what people say.

1038
01:13:01,135 --> 01:13:02,648
She's just a friend.

1039
01:13:04,655 --> 01:13:06,771
I'd hold on to that girl,
she's a good girl.

1040
01:13:07,095 --> 01:13:08,767
How gay can you get?

1041
01:13:13,055 --> 01:13:14,852
Are we okay then?

1042
01:13:18,015 --> 01:13:21,690
Are you coming
with us? Yeah, ok.

1043
01:13:59,575 --> 01:14:01,247
Girls. Wait for me!

1044
01:14:04,015 --> 01:14:05,733
Has it started?

1045
01:14:06,535 --> 01:14:08,173
God, am I too late?

1046
01:15:22,775 --> 01:15:23,890
Hi, guys.

1047
01:15:25,415 --> 01:15:26,734
It's going to be strange
playing against you, man.

1048
01:15:26,935 --> 01:15:28,004
Why's that?

1049
01:15:28,375 --> 01:15:30,843
I'm usually in the
same team as you.

1050
01:15:31,295 --> 01:15:32,853
We've always been on
the same team.

1051
01:15:33,695 --> 01:15:35,014
What do you mean?

1052
01:15:38,455 --> 01:15:40,366
Hey, is there a
Gay Pride ball afterwards?

1053
01:15:40,775 --> 01:15:41,810
Down at the Gay Bar,
are you coming?

1054
01:15:42,335 --> 01:15:43,529
Yeah, guess so.

1055
01:15:43,815 --> 01:15:45,248
Why don't you just
come with us?

1056
01:15:45,535 --> 01:15:48,413
Yeah, why not.
- See you later.

1057
01:15:58,335 --> 01:16:01,247
We're not sitting here!
Come on, get up!

1058
01:16:02,935 --> 01:16:03,845
What do you mean?

1059
01:16:04,335 --> 01:16:06,246
You're coming with me or
I'm not talking to you anymore.

1060
01:16:09,415 --> 01:16:11,371
Have you spoken
to your dad?

1061
01:16:12,615 --> 01:16:14,367
He spoke to me earlier.

1062
01:16:14,735 --> 01:16:18,523
Now he knows I exist,
I'm not just anybody anymore.

1063
01:16:20,255 --> 01:16:22,086
Let's get the crowd going!

1064
01:17:03,855 --> 01:17:08,645
Well then, lads, here we are.
Don't worry if you are nervous.

1065
01:17:09,975 --> 01:17:13,126
The main thing is to
forget about the crowd,

1066
01:17:14,095 --> 01:17:17,167
and all the things people
want to read into this game.

1067
01:17:17,735 --> 01:17:18,804
How can I put it?

1068
01:17:19,215 --> 01:17:21,046
This is football, right?

1069
01:17:24,735 --> 01:17:27,966
I mean when I scored that goal
against Arsenal...

1070
01:17:34,255 --> 01:17:39,409
...it was a great goal,
and an unforgettable experience

1071
01:17:41,135 --> 01:17:45,811
to score in front
of 35 thousand people.

1072
01:17:46,695 --> 01:17:48,890
You'll never experience that, lads.

1073
01:17:49,335 --> 01:17:51,053
But you can believe in it.

1074
01:17:53,495 --> 01:17:56,487
Let's go for it, into
the game in that spirit.

1075
01:17:56,855 --> 01:17:58,925
I was just playing football!

1076
01:18:00,375 --> 01:18:03,492
Just a man and a ball,
a ball and a man,

1077
01:18:04,975 --> 01:18:08,092
and we're in this together and
we'll do our best, right?

1078
01:18:08,575 --> 01:18:10,566
And even better than
that if we need to.

1079
01:18:11,615 --> 01:18:14,083
Guys, it doesn't
matter who wins.

1080
01:18:19,175 --> 01:18:20,927
This is about who
scores more goals.

1081
01:18:21,215 --> 01:18:22,364
A man, a ball.

1082
01:18:23,535 --> 01:18:26,368
Let's do it! Together!

1083
01:18:26,695 --> 01:18:28,447
Faggots, faggots!

1084
01:18:28,975 --> 01:18:31,125
Fucking faggot football!

1085
01:18:31,895 --> 01:18:33,567
Come on then!

1086
01:18:36,015 --> 01:18:37,289
You're not going out
in that dress?

1087
01:18:37,615 --> 01:18:39,094
Put some pants on.

1088
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:25,251
For a friend.

1089
01:19:34,095 --> 01:19:36,609
We didn't do too well, did we?

1090
01:19:38,455 --> 01:19:41,128
You didn't seriously think
we were going to win, did you?

1091
01:19:41,695 --> 01:19:44,493
No, maybe not, but...

1092
01:19:46,495 --> 01:19:49,134
That's football.

1093
01:19:50,305 --> 01:19:56,506
