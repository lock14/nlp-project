1
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,788
How much is it so far?

2
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:40,857
$8 and 25 cents.

3
00:01:41,034 --> 00:01:42,558
OK.

4
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:48,030
- How much?
- $11.30.

5
00:01:48,542 --> 00:01:51,010
- How much is the meat?
- $ 3.05.

6
00:01:51,478 --> 00:01:53,912
I'll leave it.
I only have $11.50.

7
00:01:54,081 --> 00:01:55,776
But it's $ 11.30.

8
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,540
But I need to get matches.
How much are the matches?

9
00:01:59,352 --> 00:02:00,580
$ 1.20.

10
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:04,223
I don't have enough.
Sorry, but I need the matches.

11
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:08,622
- I've already rung up the meat.
- Can you take the detergent out?

12
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,763
I've rung up the detergent too.

13
00:02:11,965 --> 00:02:15,264
- I need to get the matches.
- What do I do?

14
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,666
And... I need...

15
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:25,574
- What was it?
- I will have to open it.

16
00:02:26,746 --> 00:02:29,806
- What's the matter?
- I didn't know the meat...

17
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,543
- was so expensive.
- How much do you have?

18
00:02:33,487 --> 00:02:34,886
I have $ 11.50.

19
00:02:35,355 --> 00:02:36,913
But it's only $ 11.30.

20
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:40,057
But I need to get the matches and
they're not in there yet.

21
00:02:41,027 --> 00:02:42,824
- How much are the matches?
- $1.20.

22
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:51,728
What are you leaving out?

23
00:02:52,539 --> 00:02:54,370
How much is the detergent?

24
00:02:55,475 --> 00:02:56,737
$ 1.15.

25
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,444
And the sponge?

26
00:03:00,814 --> 00:03:02,441
It's 40 cents.

27
00:03:09,089 --> 00:03:10,317
So?

28
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,555
Ok, you can leave the meat out.

29
00:03:20,867 --> 00:03:22,334
$ .45.

30
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:27,169
I dropped my coin there.

31
00:03:31,211 --> 00:03:32,803
- Here.
- Thanks.

32
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:20,058
THE MAN WHO COPIED

33
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,186
My name is André.

34
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:59,897
It was my father's name.
It was he who chose mine.

35
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:03,467
My mom called me Zinho. But my
father always called me André.

36
00:05:04,271 --> 00:05:06,501
Later he gave up and started
calling me Zinho too.

37
00:05:08,108 --> 00:05:11,407
I live in Porto Alegre,
in the south of Brasil.

38
00:05:11,778 --> 00:05:15,214
I live on this street,
Presidente Roosevelt Ave.

39
00:05:17,517 --> 00:05:19,849
Roosevelt was a president
of the U.S.

40
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,817
He was married to his cousin.

41
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:24,889
He invented
the Roosevelt Doctrine.

42
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,889
But I had no time
to read about that.

43
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,126
I don't know what a doctrine is,
I think it's a bunch of rules.

44
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:34,663
It sounds like an old lady's name.
Granny Doctrine.

45
00:05:36,236 --> 00:05:39,433
From my bedroom window
I see a club, the Gondoliers.

46
00:05:39,906 --> 00:05:42,067
There's a gondola on its roof.

47
00:05:42,242 --> 00:05:44,335
I don't know if there ever were
gondolas here.

48
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:49,247
I work in this shop.
I'm a photocopier operator.

49
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:53,475
When the machineJams
you remove the paper.

50
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,720
And throw away the copy.

51
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:03,529
Usually you only have to press
these two buttons: Start, stop.

52
00:06:04,064 --> 00:06:07,830
I should stop or the Blob will
catch me through his mirror.

53
00:06:08,134 --> 00:06:10,568
He says the mirror
is for our safety.

54
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,500
The Blob thinks I'm a sucker.

55
00:06:12,972 --> 00:06:16,305
Considering what he pays me,
I guess he's right.

56
00:06:16,643 --> 00:06:18,804
The Blob's name is Mr. Gomide.

57
00:06:20,113 --> 00:06:22,547
Mrs. Blob is called Maria.

58
00:06:22,749 --> 00:06:25,445
She comes to the shop to
look at magazines and get money.

59
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:28,348
Little Blob's name is Rodrigo.
Or Diogo.

60
00:06:28,555 --> 00:06:30,955
They call him Guigo.

61
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,521
He likes the light
in the paper cabinet.

62
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:34,853
Don't.

63
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,392
This is important too.

64
00:06:36,563 --> 00:06:39,464
- Leave him, André!
- The paper must be very dry.

65
00:06:39,733 --> 00:06:42,861
Or it gets stuck together,
Mrs. Gomide.

66
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,832
Get the boy out of here, Maria.

67
00:06:45,505 --> 00:06:48,133
Come Guigo, don't touch that!

68
00:06:48,341 --> 00:06:50,707
Good, Mrs. Blob, off you go.

69
00:06:50,877 --> 00:06:52,777
- I'm going.
- Bye, little blob.

70
00:07:04,057 --> 00:07:06,890
When the paper runs out,
you open the drawer...

71
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:08,720
and put in the paper.

72
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:11,257
First you loosen the paper.

73
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:14,922
Hold, fold, loosen.

74
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:17,226
Once more.

75
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:20,230
Then you put the paper here
and close the drawer.

76
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,273
Then you choose
lighter or darker.

77
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,706
It's best to leave it
in the center.

78
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:27,710
Right, Blob.
In the center.

79
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:31,641
You tell her how many copies.
You put the original here.

80
00:07:31,985 --> 00:07:33,885
If it's a book, you hold it.

81
00:07:34,254 --> 00:07:38,350
When you press this button you are
saying: Go ahead, baby.

82
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:39,990
And off she goes.

83
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,958
This light is the best part.

84
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,867
OK. Now you know all
you need to know to do what I do.

85
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:56,702
Photocopier operator.

86
00:07:57,277 --> 00:07:58,904
Big shit.

87
00:07:59,279 --> 00:08:03,511
That's what I tell girls if they
ask me. Only if they ask me.

88
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:06,243
- So what do you do?
- Me?

89
00:08:06,453 --> 00:08:08,785
I'm a photocopier operator.

90
00:08:09,489 --> 00:08:10,922
What's that?

91
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,522
I operate a photocopying machine.

92
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:15,793
Like... Xerox?

93
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,059
Yes, but it's another brand.

94
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,566
You make photocopies in a firm?

95
00:08:21,801 --> 00:08:24,031
No, no. In a shop.

96
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,033
Cool.

97
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:32,605
Very cool. Start, stop, the paper
with the light, the drawer...

98
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:36,977
button in the center, how many
copies, and go ahead, baby.

99
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:39,777
How many brain cells
do you need to do this?

100
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:41,648
It sucks.

101
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:45,154
It's for the money.
I work with illustrations.

102
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:47,691
I've sent some material
to a magazine.

103
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,728
"Material". I don't think
she bought that one.

104
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,126
Girls are smart.

105
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,171
When I'm not working,
I stay home drawing.

106
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:13,277
It's fun because it's useless,
except as a pick up line.

107
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:17,581
But it's never worked yet.
Girls are very smart.

108
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,816
Girls can tell a photocopier
operator in seconds.

109
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:24,490
No girl dreams of spending her
life with a photocopier operator.

110
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:27,655
Or traveling
with a photocopier operator...

111
00:09:28,301 --> 00:09:30,997
having children
with a photocopier operator.

112
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:37,635
At least I have never met
a girl who dreamt of that.

113
00:09:41,681 --> 00:09:43,342
She's not home yet.

114
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,915
She lives with her father.
I think it's her father, must be.

115
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,954
By the look of their furniture,
they can't have much money.

116
00:09:52,859 --> 00:09:55,555
But her father works,
he has a uniform.

117
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:59,057
His shirt has those things
on the shoulders with buttons.

118
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,390
Maybe he's a cop.

119
00:10:01,568 --> 00:10:04,036
Or a public health agent,
who kills mosquitoes.

120
00:10:05,238 --> 00:10:07,399
Maybe he's a
public health agent.

121
00:10:09,342 --> 00:10:10,570
She's arrived.

122
00:10:11,978 --> 00:10:13,138
Beautiful.

123
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:17,045
She goes straight to her room,
I think she eats out.

124
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,782
Sometimes she gets
something in the kitchen.

125
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:21,921
Only sometimes,
almost never.

126
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,989
She always arrives after 11
and goes to her room.

127
00:10:25,592 --> 00:10:29,084
I think she goes to night classes,
she carries books with her.

128
00:10:29,862 --> 00:10:33,958
Her window is covered with paper,
but for a small gap.

129
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,929
There are 3 stickers
on the window.

130
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:38,900
A smiling face,
a drawing, dolls.

131
00:10:39,405 --> 00:10:42,101
A piece of paper
with 4 dots of glue.

132
00:10:42,275 --> 00:10:44,072
A postcard, maybe.

133
00:10:44,811 --> 00:10:47,405
Sometimes she stops
and looks at it.

134
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,442
It must be a photo.

135
00:10:56,522 --> 00:11:00,356
She had blinds, but they
rotted away and were taken down.

136
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,290
Venetian blinds
must be expensive.

137
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:06,164
In the wardrobe
I can only see clothes.

138
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,995
She has 2 paJamas, tonight
she's chosen the white one.

139
00:11:10,303 --> 00:11:12,533
I can only see
part of the wardrobe.

140
00:11:12,705 --> 00:11:15,697
She often leaves the door open.
It has a mirror.

141
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:20,575
Depending on the angle of door,
I see a different part of the room.

142
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:24,976
There's a flowery eiderdown
on the bed.

143
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:27,345
A tapestry showing a girl.

144
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:29,750
A TV, but I only see its glow.

145
00:11:29,956 --> 00:11:31,753
She watches movies till late.

146
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,218
A brush with a wooden handle.

147
00:11:34,494 --> 00:11:37,691
A teddy bear.
A red ladybird.

148
00:11:37,864 --> 00:11:39,798
There is a lamp by the bed.

149
00:11:39,966 --> 00:11:42,059
A small table, a white vase.

150
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:47,729
That's it. That's all.

151
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:53,134
I earn two minimum wages,
$ 302 a month.

152
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:56,780
After the discounts, 290.
The price of tennis shoes.

153
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,250
I don't spend on transport,
I walk to work, I never go out.

154
00:12:00,853 --> 00:12:04,254
My mom buys the food,
I pay half the rent.

155
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:09,293
2 bedrooms and a maid's room,
if we had a maid, a very small one.

156
00:12:09,662 --> 00:12:15,157
Living room, bathroom, kitchen,
for only $380, including fees.

157
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,035
That leaves me $ 100.

158
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:20,866
I pay half of the TVinstallments,
a 14", remote control.

159
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:24,168
$ 64, I pay $ 32.

160
00:12:24,944 --> 00:12:26,343
I get left with $ 68.

161
00:12:26,646 --> 00:12:30,946
I spend on silly things:
Amagazine, a beer, a pen, clothes.

162
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,517
To buy my binoculars
I had to save for one year.

163
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,283
You see the bridge from here.

164
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:40,989
Every day it lifts
to let a ship go through.

165
00:12:44,464 --> 00:12:47,763
It's really fun to be far away
and see someone from up close.

166
00:12:50,503 --> 00:12:52,266
Sometimes I read magazines
at work.

167
00:12:52,638 --> 00:12:55,835
But mostly I read stuff
that photocopy.

168
00:12:57,577 --> 00:13:00,307
I can only read a few lines
from each sheet.

169
00:13:01,481 --> 00:13:03,278
Better than nothing.

170
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:08,952
Shakespeare and Cervantes died
on the same day: 23rd of April 1616.

171
00:13:09,322 --> 00:13:11,017
They never even met.

172
00:13:11,324 --> 00:13:13,417
Cervantes was buried
in a common grave.

173
00:13:13,693 --> 00:13:16,025
I don't know
what common grave means.

174
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:18,527
What difference does it make?

175
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,698
One of these days
there was a Shakespeare poem.

176
00:13:23,002 --> 00:13:25,869
"When I do count the clock
that tells the time.

177
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:28,905
And see the brave day sunk
in hideous night."

178
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:31,509
When I behold the violet
past prime.

179
00:13:31,677 --> 00:13:34,043
And sable curls,
all silver'd o'er with white.

180
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,942
When lofty trees I see
barren of leaves.

181
00:13:36,115 --> 00:13:39,050
Which erst from heat
did canopy the herd.

182
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,880
And summer's green
all girded up in sheaves.

183
00:13:42,054 --> 00:13:44,716
Borne on the bier with white
and bristly beard.

184
00:13:45,024 --> 00:13:47,390
Then of thy beauty
do I question make.

185
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,994
That thou among
the wastes of time must go.

186
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,791
Since sweets and beauties
do themselves forsake.

187
00:13:52,965 --> 00:13:55,456
"And die as fast
as they see others grow.

188
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:58,103
"And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe
can make defense."

189
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:02,502
- The girl's here to get her work.
- Thanks.

190
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:05,473
I didn't get it.
I didn't even read the last line.

191
00:14:05,912 --> 00:14:07,903
I don't know what bristly means.

192
00:14:08,247 --> 00:14:11,808
I haven't mentioned Marinez.
She'd gone out to pay a bill.

193
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:16,952
She sells magazines,
pencils, erasers, glue.

194
00:14:17,757 --> 00:14:22,888
Hot. She knows she's hot.
She wears really tight pants.

195
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:25,929
I have to lie down
to put them on.

196
00:14:26,299 --> 00:14:30,030
I imagined the scene,
her lying down, legs up...

197
00:14:30,203 --> 00:14:32,068
trying to fit
into those tight pants.

198
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:35,740
I'd better not imagine it,
I'm way out of her league.

199
00:14:36,509 --> 00:14:39,842
She had a German boyfriend,
he wrote to her twice.

200
00:14:40,012 --> 00:14:42,845
He's German but he lives in
Der Haagen, Holland.

201
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:46,041
Der Haagen means
"The Hague".

202
00:14:46,352 --> 00:14:47,580
Hay?

203
00:14:48,087 --> 00:14:52,490
Hague. The name of the town,
in Holland, where he lives.

204
00:14:52,692 --> 00:14:55,183
It would be like "the Brasilia".

205
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:57,793
Get it?

206
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:00,489
The Hague.
Der Haagen.

207
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:02,898
Oh.

208
00:15:03,169 --> 00:15:05,467
I said "oh"
to stop the conversation.

209
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:08,869
A poor father is destiny.
But a poor husband is stupidity.

210
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,566
She's hot
and a philosopher too.

211
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:13,109
Poverty is...

212
00:15:13,546 --> 00:15:15,514
either destiny or stupidity.

213
00:15:16,048 --> 00:15:17,515
Right.

214
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:22,710
Destiny or stupidity.
In my case, a bit of both.

215
00:15:23,623 --> 00:15:27,286
My father left when I was 4.
This is the destiny part.

216
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,290
I was watching cartoons on TV.

217
00:15:30,496 --> 00:15:33,863
The set was a house cut in half
so you could see inside it.

218
00:15:34,634 --> 00:15:36,431
I saw a book cover like that.

219
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:39,364
Will you keep my mail for me?

220
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:47,708
He didn't get many letters,
it was mostly bills and Junk mail.

221
00:15:48,147 --> 00:15:50,445
I kept everything in a shirt box.

222
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:53,449
When it got too small
I put it all in a shoebox.

223
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:57,986
Then in 3 boxes, split
into bills, ads and letters.

224
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:02,356
One day I was talking
to my fat schoolmate Mairoldi.

225
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:06,089
I said I didn't think my dad
would come back.

226
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,833
I don't think my dad
will come back.

227
00:16:09,235 --> 00:16:11,135
- Did he go on a trip?
- Yes.

228
00:16:11,404 --> 00:16:13,304
- When?
- 7 years ago.

229
00:16:16,208 --> 00:16:18,438
He started laughing, a lot.

230
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,251
He went blind on one eye.
That's the stupid part.

231
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,129
That was my last day at school.
I got thrown out.

232
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:40,457
I didn't want
to go anymore either.

233
00:16:45,805 --> 00:16:49,263
While my mom watches soaps
on TVI stay in my room, drawing.

234
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,470
One-Eyed Zack
lives with Granny Doctrine.

235
00:16:52,645 --> 00:16:55,273
"You have to
pay attention in class."

236
00:16:55,548 --> 00:16:58,278
"Pay attention to
what the teachers say."

237
00:16:58,451 --> 00:17:01,011
"If you don't
understand something, ask!"

238
00:17:01,554 --> 00:17:06,958
"Pedro Alvares Cabral discovered
Brazil on April 22nd 1500."

239
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:08,486
Why?

240
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,629
Duh...

241
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:16,425
My mom drags her slippers
from the bathroom to the kitchen.

242
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:20,200
She opens the cupboard, gets
a glass, closes the cupboard...

243
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:23,433
opens the fridge, gets the
water bottle, closes the fridge...

244
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:25,577
fills the glass,
only haltway...

245
00:17:25,845 --> 00:17:28,643
opens the fridge, puts the
bottle away, gets the glass...

246
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:31,715
opens the filter,
fills the glass...

247
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:34,409
drags her slippers from the
kitchen to the bedroom and says:

248
00:17:34,587 --> 00:17:37,988
"Goodnight, son, I'm going to bed.
TVmakes me so sleepy..."

249
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,682
Goodnight, son. I'm going to bed.
TV makes me so sleepy...

250
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,586
Goodnight, mom.

251
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:49,931
Then I go to the kitchen,
get something from the fridge...

252
00:17:50,102 --> 00:17:53,697
and go to the living room. I turn
the TVand watch a bit of everything.

253
00:17:55,474 --> 00:17:57,601
I like it better
with the sound off.

254
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,568
It's like a fire,
or a lit up aquarium.

255
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,904
Only the light and the movement.

256
00:18:05,518 --> 00:18:07,486
At 11 I get the binoculars.

257
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,712
A lot of people are still awake.

258
00:18:11,457 --> 00:18:13,391
One thing I've found from
watching the neighbors...

259
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:15,891
is that fat people
go to bed late.

260
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:18,496
I don't know why,
it's statistics.

261
00:18:18,664 --> 00:18:22,657
Among the last people to go to bed
there is at least one fat person.

262
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,469
I'd like to know
what music he listens to.

263
00:18:32,812 --> 00:18:36,373
I've discovered
another important thing.

264
00:18:36,649 --> 00:18:38,412
If you want to see something
with binoculars...

265
00:18:38,584 --> 00:18:40,779
you can't switch
between windows.

266
00:18:41,053 --> 00:18:44,216
You have to stay on one window
and wait. It's like fishing.

267
00:19:01,474 --> 00:19:04,341
The most I've seen
was her in undies and bra.

268
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:06,068
SheJust passed.

269
00:19:06,612 --> 00:19:09,172
I had been waiting for
nearly one hour and she passed.

270
00:19:10,716 --> 00:19:13,617
I think it lasted about...
2 seconds.

271
00:19:15,087 --> 00:19:16,213
It was worth it.

272
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:29,099
When yourJob doesn't
require you to think...

273
00:19:29,268 --> 00:19:31,896
you use the time
to think about other things.

274
00:19:34,273 --> 00:19:38,004
When I worked
as a bagger at a supermarket...

275
00:19:38,177 --> 00:19:40,145
all I thought of
was becoming famous.

276
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,640
I imagined
being a famous footballer.

277
00:19:42,948 --> 00:19:47,112
I imagined scoring brilliant,
decisive goals.

278
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:49,612
In one of them
I dribbled the back and kicked.

279
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:51,119
Right into the net.

280
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,850
Another one was a header,
at the end of the match.

281
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,926
I also liked one
where I caught it with the chest...

282
00:19:56,095 --> 00:19:59,189
and kicked,
no chance for the goalie.

283
00:19:59,465 --> 00:20:01,660
Then I ran with arms open...

284
00:20:01,834 --> 00:20:05,998
44 minutes into the second half,
the crowd going wild.

285
00:20:07,306 --> 00:20:12,403
It's cool to run with open arms,
you almost fall.

286
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:15,547
While at the same time
you feel like hugging everybody.

287
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:19,047
I never saw myselfJumping
and punching the air like Pelé.

288
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:20,776
It only worked with Pelé.

289
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,080
If anyone else did it
he'd look like a queer.

290
00:20:29,094 --> 00:20:31,119
Can you take the oil can
from over the fruit?

291
00:20:31,764 --> 00:20:35,632
- Sorry?
- Too heavy, it will bruise the fruit.

292
00:20:35,834 --> 00:20:38,394
- Put it in the box.
- Sorry.

293
00:20:39,004 --> 00:20:41,632
Or the fruit will get all bruised.

294
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:45,140
- I've said I'm sorry.
- No need to be angry.

295
00:20:45,344 --> 00:20:49,303
I only asked you to take
the can from over the fruit.

296
00:20:49,481 --> 00:20:52,678
But I've put the can here,
what more must I do?

297
00:20:52,851 --> 00:20:54,443
- What's the problem?
- This boy.

298
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,484
I've asked him to take the can
from over the fruit...

299
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:01,114
- and he got stroppy.
- I said I'm sorry.

300
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:04,285
Please excuse us,
he is a bit cranky.

301
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,630
Don't worry,
it won't happen again.

302
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:14,103
Here I earn the same and I don't
have to do any heavy work.

303
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,532
I don't think about
being famous anymore.

304
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:19,735
Now I think about making money.

305
00:21:20,779 --> 00:21:21,871
Lots of money.

306
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:23,947
It's wonderful!

307
00:21:24,883 --> 00:21:27,647
Look at this bed,
full of cushions!

308
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,353
I love this thing over the bed.

309
00:21:31,523 --> 00:21:32,956
Dossal.

310
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,884
Dosser?

311
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:38,552
No, Dossal. It's the name
of this thing, dossal.

312
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:45,597
When I see these rich
in magazines, I think...

313
00:21:45,771 --> 00:21:49,172
the really rich wouldn't
be showing off in a magazine.

314
00:21:50,909 --> 00:21:52,638
The first time I saw Silvia...

315
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:55,143
she was in paJamas,
having breakfast.

316
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:57,646
She was eating a cookie.

317
00:21:57,816 --> 00:22:00,341
She dipped the cookie
in the coffee and ate it.

318
00:22:06,191 --> 00:22:07,818
I fell in love.

319
00:22:12,531 --> 00:22:14,556
I started to watch
Silvia's place every day.

320
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,802
I knew what time she woke up
and got back home.

321
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:20,838
One day I decided
to find out where she worked.

322
00:22:22,074 --> 00:22:26,204
There are people who never go out.
It's called panic syndrome.

323
00:22:26,645 --> 00:22:28,704
I think it was
in a student's essay.

324
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:33,013
They stay home because
they can't leave the house.

325
00:22:35,754 --> 00:22:37,813
The problem is
you end up growing old.

326
00:22:39,892 --> 00:22:41,689
It's best to face the streets.

327
00:22:46,231 --> 00:22:48,392
I waited in front of her building.

328
00:22:49,001 --> 00:22:51,265
It's called Saint Cecilia.

329
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:57,507
The Romans cooked St. Cecilia
in a room but she didn't die.

330
00:22:58,243 --> 00:23:01,735
Then they ran out of fun things to
do and chopped her head off.

331
00:23:16,862 --> 00:23:20,764
She came out, holding books.
She was wearing her red coat.

332
00:23:20,966 --> 00:23:23,491
But her tights were blue,
matching her skirt.

333
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:25,933
I think she was late.

334
00:23:26,238 --> 00:23:28,832
I had to run too to be able
to get on the same bus.

335
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:37,443
She went to the front of the bus.
I sat in the back.

336
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,452
She didn't see me,
she was reading a book.

337
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,027
A person will never think
she is being followed...

338
00:23:53,198 --> 00:23:56,258
if you are in front of her.
I saw it in a movie.

339
00:24:07,780 --> 00:24:10,806
She went into a shop
that was still closed.

340
00:24:11,083 --> 00:24:12,812
I think she works there.

341
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:16,646
Silvia's. I still didn't know
it was a coincidence.

342
00:24:17,356 --> 00:24:19,790
I waited a while
in front of the shop.

343
00:24:20,025 --> 00:24:23,017
A coffee costs as much as a bus
ticket, but I can walk back.

344
00:24:29,034 --> 00:24:32,561
I read that a guy who drew some
puppets on the wall became rich.

345
00:24:32,738 --> 00:24:34,729
But he died soon afterwards.

346
00:24:36,208 --> 00:24:40,167
You work your whole life to
leave money to who knows whom.

347
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:42,745
He didn't even have time
to have a kid.

348
00:24:43,348 --> 00:24:48,342
The idea is to get rich fast,
as fast as possible, and take off.

349
00:24:50,189 --> 00:24:51,713
The problem is: How?

350
00:24:57,229 --> 00:25:00,596
I sent a story of One-Eyed Zack
and Granny Doctrine to a magazine.

351
00:25:00,766 --> 00:25:03,530
You can't do only what you want.

352
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:05,930
You have to do something
that will get you rich!

353
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,533
- Why?
- Because, without money...

354
00:25:08,707 --> 00:25:10,572
you can't do anything you want!

355
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:15,372
They never answered.
Then I sent one with a letter.

356
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:17,310
I asked for an answer
or to get my story back...

357
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:20,316
as other magazines
were interested.

358
00:25:21,854 --> 00:25:25,756
When I finish paying for the TV,
I'll have $ 45 left every month.

359
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:29,055
If I don't spend any of it,
in 10 years I'll buy a used car.

360
00:25:30,596 --> 00:25:32,223
It's easier to buy a gun.

361
00:25:32,397 --> 00:25:36,299
Andre, if you buy $50 of pot,
you can resell it for $100, 150...

362
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:38,960
It depends
on the state of the sucker.

363
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:41,338
I once sold a guy
$ 10 of pot...

364
00:25:41,507 --> 00:25:44,999
mixed with lots of
dried parsley for $ 100.

365
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,701
The guy loved it,
he wanted more.

366
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:50,874
I tried it. It tasted like pizza.

367
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:55,149
Man, with $500 you can buy
cooler clothes and sell cocaine.

368
00:25:55,954 --> 00:25:57,819
Coke is great business!

369
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,251
Specially if you have a deal
with the police.

370
00:26:01,093 --> 00:26:03,618
You're wasting time at that shop.

371
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:05,359
Maybe.

372
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:09,564
But I don't fancy going toJail.
Like he did, many times.

373
00:26:10,302 --> 00:26:12,930
Feitosa is crazy,
he carries a gun.

374
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,730
He says I'm a wimp.

375
00:26:14,907 --> 00:26:16,534
A sucker and a wimp.

376
00:26:16,708 --> 00:26:18,642
- From here it's OK.
- Let's go up.

377
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:21,278
- No. It's OK here.
- I'm going up.

378
00:26:33,358 --> 00:26:35,223
You're such a wimp, Andre.

379
00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:37,259
Hey, you! Get down!

380
00:26:37,596 --> 00:26:38,756
Wimp!

381
00:26:39,932 --> 00:26:41,331
Hey! Stop! Stop!

382
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,832
We'll jump off the bridge.

383
00:26:44,036 --> 00:26:45,162
Come back here!

384
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:49,239
I can get you a gun for $300!
Or $500, if you want a pistol!

385
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:53,372
With a gun I could rob someone
and get money.

386
00:26:53,845 --> 00:26:55,836
But that wouldn't
solve the problem.

387
00:26:56,982 --> 00:27:00,748
Unless I robbed someone with lots of
money, so I'd only have to rob once.

388
00:27:02,554 --> 00:27:06,581
When you start robbing every day,
you end up getting caught.

389
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:09,690
The best is to rob a bank.

390
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,795
From my window I see a bank.

391
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,759
Before working at the shop
I stayed home a lot.

392
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:21,235
I knew the bank's schedule,
which days the armored van came.

393
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,535
How much money is there
in one of those bags?

394
00:28:01,647 --> 00:28:02,875
Good morning.

395
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:04,942
Can I help you?

396
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:07,916
No, thanks, just browsing.

397
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,322
If you need anything,
just let me know.

398
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:12,955
Thank you.

399
00:28:14,726 --> 00:28:17,718
Maybe she works in the stockroom,
the office, or something.

400
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:23,165
Would her boss leave her in the
back and this one out here?

401
00:28:23,435 --> 00:28:25,801
This one wears too much perfume.

402
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:28,139
Or maybe this one owns the shop.

403
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:31,504
- I wonder if she wears perfume?
- Have you been helped?

404
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:33,804
No!

405
00:28:34,613 --> 00:28:37,013
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

406
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:41,052
- Is it a present for your girlfriend?
- No, it's for me.

407
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,344
For my mother.

408
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:46,882
A nightgown, a robe?

409
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:49,418
- Is it a birthday present?
- Yes. Maybe.

410
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:54,763
Look, this robe here is
a very good deal, $ 38.

411
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:57,502
Look how nice it is.

412
00:28:58,336 --> 00:28:59,803
Yes, nice.

413
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,397
What's your name?

414
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,303
- Silvia.
- Oh, Silvia?

415
00:29:05,143 --> 00:29:07,168
No, I'm not the shop owner.

416
00:29:07,646 --> 00:29:09,807
When I started here
it was already called Silvia's.

417
00:29:09,981 --> 00:29:11,972
- Oh, it was a coincidence.
- Yes.

418
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:16,218
OK, I'll have another look around,
maybe I'll come back.

419
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:19,447
- But this robe's nice.
- Would you like to see a nightgown?

420
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:21,216
No, It's all right.

421
00:29:21,893 --> 00:29:24,123
You can pay
with 2 post-dated checks.

422
00:29:24,296 --> 00:29:25,991
- Can I?
- Yes.

423
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:28,860
Maybe I'll come back.
Thank you.

424
00:29:30,268 --> 00:29:31,326
Thank you.

425
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:33,993
"Thank you".

426
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:39,734
She said that as she folded the
robe, it was an automatic thing.

427
00:29:41,012 --> 00:29:42,309
$ 38...

428
00:29:42,647 --> 00:29:45,047
She must earn
10%% commission, $ 3.80.

429
00:29:45,584 --> 00:29:50,214
If she sells 10 things per day
at about that price: $ 38.

430
00:29:50,589 --> 00:29:52,420
Per month, $38 times 30...

431
00:29:52,858 --> 00:29:55,656
But it's not times 30,
Sundays don't count.

432
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,522
Let's leave it at $ 500.

433
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,990
But she probably
doesn't sell 10 things a day.

434
00:30:00,165 --> 00:30:02,827
And maybe other things
are cheaper than this robe.

435
00:30:03,001 --> 00:30:06,266
Things like panties or t-shirts.

436
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:08,235
- Marinez?
- Yes?

437
00:30:08,607 --> 00:30:10,632
How much do panties cost?

438
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:12,571
I don't know, I don't wear them.

439
00:30:13,011 --> 00:30:15,377
- Why?
- Nothing, just curious.

440
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,439
I know...

441
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:21,877
Let's say she makes $400.
On top of her salary.

442
00:30:22,053 --> 00:30:24,283
It must be like mine,
200 and something...

443
00:30:24,756 --> 00:30:28,157
600 and something per month.
Not too bad.

444
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:31,324
- Marinez?
- What?

445
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:34,931
I have some tickets for a bar
opening. Do you want one?

446
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:38,135
What bar is that?

447
00:30:38,303 --> 00:30:40,100
It belongs to a friend of mine.

448
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:43,400
It's called "Mama Grave".
You get 2 beers with that.

449
00:30:43,575 --> 00:30:45,236
Can I bring a friend?

450
00:30:46,311 --> 00:30:48,142
OK, I'll get you 2 tickets.

451
00:30:48,313 --> 00:30:50,747
- And who are you taking?
- I don't know yet.

452
00:30:52,918 --> 00:30:54,249
It didn't work out with Marinez.

453
00:30:55,453 --> 00:30:57,353
I didn't want to take her anyway.

454
00:31:05,063 --> 00:31:06,189
Silvia?

455
00:31:07,432 --> 00:31:09,559
- Hi.
- Do you remember me?

456
00:31:10,268 --> 00:31:12,395
I was here looking
for a present for my mother.

457
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:15,436
Oh. Did you find one?

458
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:20,139
Yes. But I should
have bought the robe.

459
00:31:20,445 --> 00:31:22,538
- Have you sold it?
- No. Do you want to see it?

460
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:26,047
No, I just wanted
to know if you still had it.

461
00:31:26,651 --> 00:31:29,051
- I do.
- OK, so if I decide to buy it...

462
00:31:29,221 --> 00:31:31,849
- I'll come back.
- OK.

463
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:38,887
Silvia?

464
00:31:40,298 --> 00:31:41,492
Do you like beer?

465
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:44,562
- Beer?
- Yes.

466
00:31:47,205 --> 00:31:48,672
Not so much. Why?

467
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:52,872
No. No reason, just curious.

468
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,678
So I'll get going, OK?
My lunchtime is over.

469
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,646
Do you like beer?

470
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:06,989
Silvia?

471
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,953
Do you like beer?

472
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:12,826
Beer? I love beer.

473
00:32:22,374 --> 00:32:23,500
Darling!

474
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:26,366
How are you?

475
00:32:26,578 --> 00:32:29,570
Cardoso, this is Andre,
he got us the tickets.

476
00:32:29,748 --> 00:32:32,046
Nice to meet you.
Cardoso, at your service.

477
00:32:32,217 --> 00:32:33,479
How's it going?

478
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:36,177
Look, I'll get my first beer, OK?
Excuse me.

479
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:42,093
- Interesting place.
- Yeah.

480
00:32:43,194 --> 00:32:44,957
But I don't like
these metal tables.

481
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:47,360
Once I put a glass of whisky
on one of these...

482
00:32:47,532 --> 00:32:49,830
and it started to move by itself,
because the table was wet.

483
00:32:50,001 --> 00:32:52,663
It happens at home too,
on the counter of the kitchen.

484
00:32:53,038 --> 00:32:56,337
It's a physical phenomenon,
attrition...

485
00:32:56,574 --> 00:33:00,442
Then the glass started moving.

486
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:05,474
I thought like, man, I'm so drunk.
And I was really...

487
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,311
- What?
- Drunk. But not that drunk.

488
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,818
The glass was moving by itself.
So it fell on the floor.

489
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:13,787
It's a sad thing to see whisky
all over the floor.

490
00:33:14,926 --> 00:33:16,621
Hey, there's a free table there.

491
00:33:17,862 --> 00:33:22,162
I don't like these tables.
And the name neither, "Mama Grave".

492
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,526
They love giving
English names to bars.

493
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,965
- What do you do?
- Me?

494
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:33,541
I'm a photocopier operator.

495
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,336
- Oh, at the shop with Marinez.
- That's right.

496
00:33:37,248 --> 00:33:39,808
- What about you?
- I work with antiques.

497
00:33:39,985 --> 00:33:41,612
Furniture, china...

498
00:33:42,087 --> 00:33:45,488
Sorry to ask, but do you have
to wear a tie to work?

499
00:33:46,257 --> 00:33:47,554
No.

500
00:33:50,295 --> 00:33:52,559
Listen, you and Marinez...

501
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:56,163
- Hot, isn't she?
- Oh my God, oh my God!

502
00:33:57,002 --> 00:34:01,371
- You two...
- We only work together. That's all.

503
00:34:04,142 --> 00:34:07,236
- And you?
- I'll check her out.

504
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:08,668
I'll check her out.

505
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:11,841
She's hot, you have to
play it cool.

506
00:34:12,017 --> 00:34:14,508
A hot babe like that,
guys dribbling all over her...

507
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:17,883
You have to give her a hard time.
You'll see.

508
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:22,959
Hi! I've brought 3 glasses,
the next beer is yours.

509
00:34:23,128 --> 00:34:24,857
- Will you help me?
- I only have one left...

510
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,998
I drank one before you got here.

511
00:34:30,301 --> 00:34:33,793
I'd like to make a toast
to this meeting and...

512
00:34:34,305 --> 00:34:37,001
- Well, I'm no good with words.
- It's OK.

513
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:38,802
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

514
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:46,243
My cellphone battery's run out.
I have to call a girl friend...

515
00:34:52,724 --> 00:34:54,453
He's cool, Cardoso.

516
00:34:54,793 --> 00:34:56,988
But his perfume is horrible,
did you smell it?

517
00:34:57,162 --> 00:34:58,959
And he's a lot shorter than me.

518
00:35:01,366 --> 00:35:04,494
- And did you see his tie?
- Yes, the tie is something.

519
00:35:05,670 --> 00:35:07,035
Let's dance. Come on.

520
00:35:51,516 --> 00:35:53,814
Will you put it
on that table for me?

521
00:36:16,141 --> 00:36:18,302
He thinks he's Mr. Cool.

522
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:21,576
- Who?
- Cardoso.

523
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,974
Have you seen his shoes?

524
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:27,244
They've been resoled.

525
00:36:27,418 --> 00:36:31,411
The soles are totally different
from the rest of the shoes.

526
00:36:31,589 --> 00:36:33,147
No, I haven't noticed.

527
00:36:33,691 --> 00:36:35,215
Let's sit down.

528
00:36:38,029 --> 00:36:41,590
- Now the beer has gone flat.
- Oh, it probably has.

529
00:36:43,201 --> 00:36:44,964
OK, I'll go get a beer.

530
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,407
Oh, and your friend?

531
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:54,572
What friend?

532
00:36:54,746 --> 00:36:57,306
- Weren't you calling a friend?
- Yeah! Well, she's sick.

533
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:02,211
- It could be better, this place.
- I think it's cool.

534
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:07,118
Yes. I don't feel so much like
dancing tonight, you know?

535
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:09,624
Well, I'm going to
bop till I drop tonight!

536
00:37:10,261 --> 00:37:12,695
Usually I dance til late too,
I love it.

537
00:37:12,997 --> 00:37:14,521
But tonight, I don't know...

538
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:19,226
I bought a CD collection.
The Rock "Greistest Richards"...

539
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:22,234
- What?
- "The Rock Grei"...

540
00:37:22,507 --> 00:37:24,270
"Rock Greist"..."Rich"...

541
00:37:24,776 --> 00:37:28,371
There's... really cool stuff,
like Elton John...

542
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:31,943
- There's BB King, Chuck Berry...
- Chuck Berry?

543
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,318
- Chuck Berry.
- Has it got "My ding-a-ling"?

544
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:36,650
"My ding-a-ling"?

545
00:37:43,795 --> 00:37:45,729
- Probably...
- I love that song.

546
00:37:45,964 --> 00:37:49,229
I'm sure. It's 4 CDs,
in a really cool box.

547
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:51,891
We could go by my place later,
I'll show you.

548
00:37:52,403 --> 00:37:54,371
OK. I'll come with you later.

549
00:37:55,306 --> 00:37:58,969
Great, it'll be nice,
it'll be fantastic!

550
00:37:59,143 --> 00:38:00,940
Now, let me tell you something.

551
00:38:01,579 --> 00:38:04,810
- I won't go to bed with you.
- What?

552
00:38:05,183 --> 00:38:07,651
We're not going
to have sex, Cardoso.

553
00:38:08,586 --> 00:38:12,420
- You never know that, do you?
- You don't get it. I know.

554
00:38:12,790 --> 00:38:14,417
First of all, you smoke.

555
00:38:14,592 --> 00:38:16,822
It's not because of the smoke,
or the cancer...

556
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:19,691
it's the taste I hate.

557
00:38:20,898 --> 00:38:23,128
I was thinking of quitting.

558
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,631
And you're poor, just like me.

559
00:38:26,204 --> 00:38:30,300
It's not personal,
but I won't get horny.

560
00:38:30,475 --> 00:38:32,033
Not enough to fuck you.

561
00:38:34,412 --> 00:38:35,777
I got it.

562
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:37,873
You only fuck rich guys, then?

563
00:38:38,049 --> 00:38:40,916
No, not really,
but I haven't met the guy yet.

564
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:43,917
- I'm a virgin.
- What?

565
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:47,151
But you don't have to believe it.
Nobody does anyway.

566
00:38:47,325 --> 00:38:48,758
Let's dance?

567
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,659
- You mean, you never...
- No.

568
00:39:00,405 --> 00:39:02,202
- Nothing, ever?
- No, no.

569
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:04,667
But I've done all the rest of it.

570
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:08,739
I never fucked. But I've
done everything, you know?

571
00:39:08,913 --> 00:39:10,847
But not fucking, not really.

572
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:14,307
I'll only fuck the guy
who changes my life.

573
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:20,051
Or a real gorgeous hunk,
like a movie star...

574
00:39:21,693 --> 00:39:24,594
Really romantic, funny...

575
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:26,854
sexy...

576
00:39:27,765 --> 00:39:33,135
One who makes me forget everything
and turns me into a lovesick fool.

577
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:38,937
Sorry to be so honest,
Cardoso, but you're not him.

578
00:39:43,715 --> 00:39:47,344
- But don't you feel like it?
- Of course I do!

579
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,644
So, what do you...?

580
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:52,847
- The same as you.
- What?

581
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,888
I masturbate!

582
00:40:02,133 --> 00:40:04,761
I had my beer
and they were still dancing.

583
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:06,931
It was 10 to 11.

584
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:10,404
I got on the bus, she was there.

585
00:40:15,213 --> 00:40:18,740
The bus was almost empty,
I couldn't sit next to her.

586
00:40:19,851 --> 00:40:22,411
If I sat in the back,
she wouldn't see me.

587
00:40:29,293 --> 00:40:31,090
I glanced back
and then again...

588
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,459
as if I'd taken a few
seconds to realize it was her.

589
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:36,997
Hi. Do you remember me?

590
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,425
I guess so.

591
00:40:40,171 --> 00:40:41,763
I went to your shop one day.

592
00:40:45,143 --> 00:40:48,374
Look, I'll come by tomorrow
to buy that nightgown.

593
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:52,180
- Tomorrow is Sunday.
- Then I'll come on Monday.

594
00:40:54,252 --> 00:40:57,710
- Wasn't it the robe you wanted?
- Yeah, the robe.

595
00:40:58,322 --> 00:41:01,758
If I can't on Monday, I'll come
before the weekend. For the robe.

596
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:08,592
I don't know why
I came up with that crap.

597
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:12,496
I think it was the way
she asked that question...

598
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,868
as if she didn't believe
I'd pay $ 38 for the robe.

599
00:41:18,009 --> 00:41:20,944
Now I'd have to get $ 38...

600
00:41:21,245 --> 00:41:23,645
or forget that Silvia exists.

601
00:41:25,983 --> 00:41:28,349
But I didn't have $ 38.

602
00:41:28,519 --> 00:41:30,544
I didn't even know
how to get them.

603
00:41:31,122 --> 00:41:33,317
Not before the weekend.

604
00:41:34,258 --> 00:41:37,284
The first paper money was made
in China, 11 th century.

605
00:41:37,528 --> 00:41:41,020
The emperor decreed that a piece
of paper was worth 1 kilo of rice.

606
00:41:41,199 --> 00:41:43,463
Whoever didn't believe it
got killed.

607
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:46,164
I thought of asking the Blob.

608
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:48,931
I'd have to tell him
what the money was for.

609
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:52,269
I could tell him I had to buy
a robe for my mother's birthday.

610
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:57,142
But he might meet my mother
and congratulate her.

611
00:41:57,315 --> 00:42:01,046
Goodnight, son, I'm going to bed.
TV makes me so sleepy...

612
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:02,241
Goodnight, mom.

613
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:07,016
She would think I was mad,
giving her a robe, out of the blue.

614
00:42:07,258 --> 00:42:10,022
It would be better
to hide it until her birthday.

615
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,933
I thought of asking Marinez,
but it was too humiliating.

616
00:42:18,236 --> 00:42:21,262
How then could I think
of her putting on her pants...

617
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:26,339
legs in the air, no panties,
knowing that I owed her $ 38?

618
00:42:27,612 --> 00:42:31,139
And she probably
wouldn't have $ 38 either.

619
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:37,886
I thought of asking Feitosa.

620
00:42:38,656 --> 00:42:41,648
He wouldn't lend me, but he might
give me some pot to sell.

621
00:42:41,826 --> 00:42:43,487
Wimp!

622
00:42:44,128 --> 00:42:48,792
I'd mix it with parsley and sell to
a sucker for twice the price.

623
00:42:49,667 --> 00:42:53,262
But I don't know any suckers
who'd buy parsley for pot.

624
00:42:54,205 --> 00:42:55,968
That's when I thought of Cardoso.

625
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:59,809
He had money, he might
want some pot...

626
00:42:59,977 --> 00:43:02,605
or he might lend me $ 38
until the end of the month.

627
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:06,241
Marinez? Can you
make money with antiques?

628
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:12,286
A dress worn by Marilyn
was sold for US$ 1.267 million.

629
00:43:12,623 --> 00:43:14,989
A new one, exactly like it,
must cost around US$ 500.

630
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:20,625
Cardoso wears a tie, he has a
cellphone, he drinks whisky.

631
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:23,198
He must have $ 38 to lend me.

632
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:26,928
It was the best plan to get $38
that I could make in a few hours.

633
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,948
Excuse me, do you know Cardoso?

634
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,114
In the back.

635
00:43:52,597 --> 00:43:55,065
- Cardoso?
- Just a minute, please.

636
00:43:59,904 --> 00:44:00,928
Do you remember me?

637
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:07,809
No, sorry. I quit smoking,
I can't remember a thing.

638
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:11,005
We met at Mama Grave,
I'm a friend of Marinez's.

639
00:44:11,182 --> 00:44:12,877
You work with her, right?

640
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,041
- Yes, I work...
- Hi, how are you?

641
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:16,914
You told me you worked...

642
00:44:18,422 --> 00:44:19,480
What?

643
00:44:19,757 --> 00:44:22,021
You told me you
worked with antiques...

644
00:44:22,193 --> 00:44:23,820
So?

645
00:44:24,095 --> 00:44:25,687
Do you see
anything new here?

646
00:44:26,197 --> 00:44:28,188
No, but I thought
you had money.

647
00:44:28,933 --> 00:44:31,163
But why did you think that?

648
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:34,801
Because you were flaunting it
that night.

649
00:44:34,972 --> 00:44:37,202
So?
A stunning babe like that...

650
00:44:37,375 --> 00:44:41,368
What would I tell her? I work
in a place that sells old junk?

651
00:44:41,746 --> 00:44:45,409
You too, making out to be some...
operator of...

652
00:44:45,616 --> 00:44:47,550
Right, photocopier!

653
00:44:47,718 --> 00:44:52,280
Photocopier...
You'rejust the xerox boy, I know.

654
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:56,882
OK, but it's better than
showing off in a shirt and tie.

655
00:44:59,497 --> 00:45:01,260
I know what you want.

656
00:45:01,499 --> 00:45:03,831
You fancy her, so you came
for an explanation.

657
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:06,128
Me? Marinez?
No, not me!

658
00:45:06,437 --> 00:45:08,166
Why are getting
in my way, then?

659
00:45:08,305 --> 00:45:11,069
I'm not. It was you
with that antique bullshit.

660
00:45:11,609 --> 00:45:14,510
It's only normal:
Giving the chick some attention.

661
00:45:14,679 --> 00:45:18,638
Have you never tried to chat up
a girl with this operator bull?

662
00:45:18,816 --> 00:45:20,716
Yeah. I have.

663
00:45:24,955 --> 00:45:26,320
So, what do you want?

664
00:45:26,757 --> 00:45:28,384
I wanted to... I...

665
00:45:30,027 --> 00:45:32,325
Do you want to go for a coffee?

666
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:34,858
Yes, but...

667
00:45:37,201 --> 00:45:39,567
- Are you paying?
- Oh no, I have no money.

668
00:45:40,137 --> 00:45:43,800
Oh, then. Why don't we leave it
for another time?

669
00:45:43,974 --> 00:45:46,636
I've quit smoking.
Smoking is a drag! Coffee...

670
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:48,676
I quit yesterday.
When did I say it was?

671
00:45:48,946 --> 00:45:51,380
- Today.
- Today? No, it was yesterday.

672
00:45:51,549 --> 00:45:53,073
Not one since yesterday.

673
00:45:53,317 --> 00:45:55,683
Smoking? No, no more.

674
00:45:55,853 --> 00:45:57,980
It's tough,
coffee reminds you of smoking.

675
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:01,022
But I can't stop doing everything
I like because I quit smoking.

676
00:46:01,192 --> 00:46:05,686
Like, I like to smoke after...
you know? I love it!

677
00:46:05,863 --> 00:46:08,058
The girl says:
Let's make love.

678
00:46:08,232 --> 00:46:11,463
"No, sorry, if I make love to you
I'll feel like smoking."

679
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:14,895
What's your problem?
Two coffees, please.

680
00:46:17,141 --> 00:46:19,302
I need $ 38.

681
00:46:19,977 --> 00:46:23,538
Is that why you've come to see me,
to borrow money?

682
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:25,439
I thought you had money.

683
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:29,052
$ 38? No way.

684
00:46:30,321 --> 00:46:32,915
OK. Alright, I'll find a way.

685
00:46:33,457 --> 00:46:35,015
What do you need the money for?

686
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:36,716
To buy a robe.

687
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:39,694
- A robe?
- Yes, a chenille robe.

688
00:46:41,165 --> 00:46:43,861
Sorry, don't get me wrong,
but who's it for?

689
00:46:44,201 --> 00:46:46,499
- For my mom.
- Is it her birthday?

690
00:46:46,704 --> 00:46:47,864
Kind of.

691
00:46:49,974 --> 00:46:51,100
$ 10.

692
00:46:52,910 --> 00:46:55,003
No. It has to be the robe.

693
00:46:55,179 --> 00:46:57,170
What is it?
Mothers love angels!

694
00:46:57,348 --> 00:47:01,341
They prefer angels to robes.
Grandmothers like robes.

695
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:05,044
- I need $ 38.
- You don't give up, do you?

696
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:08,123
Come on, get the angel, just $ 10,
you pay later...

697
00:47:08,726 --> 00:47:09,886
What angel is that?

698
00:47:10,060 --> 00:47:13,359
Does it have a sword?
Then it's a guardian angel.

699
00:47:14,598 --> 00:47:16,122
I liked the angel.

700
00:47:17,568 --> 00:47:20,162
I made a wish: $ 38.

701
00:47:21,071 --> 00:47:22,663
I need $ 38.

702
00:47:29,747 --> 00:47:32,147
- What's this?
- A color photocopier.

703
00:47:32,416 --> 00:47:33,940
Now you'll have to
wear a smock.

704
00:47:35,085 --> 00:47:37,178
This one's more complicated.

705
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:40,016
It has lots of controls.

706
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:42,182
To protect your clothes.
It looks more professional.

707
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:45,795
The smock is horrible:
Hot, it pinches my neck.

708
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:47,688
But the machine is great.

709
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,696
It can even make money.

710
00:47:50,568 --> 00:47:52,058
$ 38.

711
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:54,895
I could copy a $ 50 bill.

712
00:47:55,472 --> 00:47:58,532
If I had a $ 50 bill
I wouldn't need to copy it.

713
00:47:59,510 --> 00:48:03,310
I can borrow. Not the money,
Just the banknote. Yes...

714
00:48:04,114 --> 00:48:07,049
Once Mairoldi lent me
a bill of 10 at school.

715
00:48:07,518 --> 00:48:10,681
My mom gave me two bills of 5
to pay him back.

716
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:13,388
He lent me one bill of 10,
a blue one!

717
00:48:13,557 --> 00:48:16,082
I won't give him back
2 old red bills!

718
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:19,696
5 plus 5 makes 10!

719
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:22,192
What do they teach you in maths?

720
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,991
I don't want to go to school!

721
00:48:25,236 --> 00:48:27,170
I'll explain it to Mrs. Bristly.

722
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:32,039
No! Not Mrs. Bristly!

723
00:48:32,776 --> 00:48:34,175
I don't want to go to school.

724
00:48:34,478 --> 00:48:36,241
My mother took me to school.

725
00:48:36,547 --> 00:48:38,708
She gave Mairoldi the 2 bills.

726
00:48:39,416 --> 00:48:41,179
The money he owed you.

727
00:48:42,553 --> 00:48:43,645
OK.

728
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:45,515
Didn't I tell you?

729
00:48:46,924 --> 00:48:48,755
Mairoldi is an idiot.

730
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,461
Will you pay this for me tomorrow,
before coming to the shop?

731
00:48:53,864 --> 00:48:55,195
Sure.

732
00:48:55,366 --> 00:48:57,095
And let's go,
it's already 5 past 6.

733
00:49:00,571 --> 00:49:02,300
- Mr. Gomide?
- Yes.

734
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:06,607
If you don't mind me closing,
I could stay later.

735
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:09,143
To learn to use the machine,
read the manual.

736
00:49:09,813 --> 00:49:11,576
Come in early tomorrow.

737
00:49:11,849 --> 00:49:14,443
But I have to go pay your bill.

738
00:49:16,053 --> 00:49:17,486
What's this?

739
00:49:17,688 --> 00:49:19,588
It's an angel.
For my mother.

740
00:49:19,857 --> 00:49:21,017
Birthday?

741
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:23,785
No. But I thought she'd like it.
It's a guardian angel.

742
00:49:24,228 --> 00:49:27,197
This is the angel Gabriel.
Look at the sword.

743
00:49:27,831 --> 00:49:31,767
- Is it? She'll like it anyway.
- Sure she will.

744
00:49:32,536 --> 00:49:34,060
You can close the shop.

745
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:36,272
Just don't stay too late.

746
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,409
Last week our neighbors were
robbed. Be careful.

747
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,334
Sure, don't worry.

748
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:57,024
I looked for paper
that looked like banknote paper.

749
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:04,197
The biggest difficulty is that
you have to print on both sides.

750
00:50:04,368 --> 00:50:07,201
And it's hard to make it right,
one note on top of the other.

751
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:11,437
It took me about
5 hours to do it.

752
00:50:12,710 --> 00:50:15,338
I managed to make a bill that
looked very similar to real money.

753
00:50:36,066 --> 00:50:39,433
But if you looked carefully,
you'd soon notice it was a copy.

754
00:50:41,572 --> 00:50:45,303
I can't pay Silvia with a fake.
She can get into trouble.

755
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:49,974
Or I could be arrested in her
shop, and then it's all over.

756
00:50:51,148 --> 00:50:55,175
I have to change the money.
The problem is where to change it.

757
00:52:02,086 --> 00:52:04,554
Boy?

758
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:07,250
Your receipt.

759
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:41,691
I think it was the angel
who made me give the real note.

760
00:52:42,226 --> 00:52:45,093
A bank is the worst place in the
world to try to change this money.

761
00:52:50,334 --> 00:52:52,063
I could try this bar.

762
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:55,202
I won't screw the guy,
he's as broke as me.

763
00:52:55,405 --> 00:52:59,068
And they don't like to break a 50.
What if he decides to check it?

764
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:03,473
LOTTERIES

765
00:53:10,954 --> 00:53:14,014
Here the money goes to one register.
It all gets mixed quickly.

766
00:53:14,291 --> 00:53:15,758
Everyone's in a hurry.

767
00:53:16,260 --> 00:53:18,751
And there's no proof
that I gave them that bill.

768
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:23,460
I can make a $ 9 bet and
take $ 41 change, real money.

769
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:35,701
I must ask her something,
to distract her attention.

770
00:53:36,413 --> 00:53:38,176
I've done that with a doorman.

771
00:53:39,049 --> 00:53:42,382
"What's the date today?
Do you know what the prize is?"

772
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,414
"How much is a bet
on 6 numbers?"

773
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,981
"$9? Wasn't it $8?
It's gone up?"

774
00:53:47,224 --> 00:53:49,055
- Are you into angels?
- Sorry?

775
00:53:49,493 --> 00:53:52,155
I bought this
for my mother's birthday.

776
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:54,229
It's meant to be
a guardian angel.

777
00:53:54,398 --> 00:53:56,298
But my boss said
it's St. Gabriel.

778
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:00,333
I don't know much about angels.
I think it's an archangel.

779
00:54:00,771 --> 00:54:02,033
It's St. Michael.

780
00:54:02,372 --> 00:54:06,069
- What's the difference?
- The armor! It's St. Michael.

781
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:08,904
- Oh, I see.
- Your mother will like it.

782
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:12,112
Thank you.

783
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:22,682
"Guardian angel, meek and mild,
look on me, your little child."

784
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,690
"Bless me now, the day is done."

785
00:54:25,896 --> 00:54:27,261
"Amen."

786
00:54:50,654 --> 00:54:51,848
Hi.

787
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:53,046
Hi.

788
00:54:53,223 --> 00:54:55,748
I'm here to buy the robe.
The robe.

789
00:54:56,460 --> 00:54:57,859
Oh, for your mother!

790
00:54:58,061 --> 00:55:00,586
I have it in two colors.
I'll show you.

791
00:55:02,366 --> 00:55:05,893
We have new nightgowns in,
a little more expensive.

792
00:55:06,069 --> 00:55:08,867
- Would you like to see?
- I think I prefer the robe.

793
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,732
It was this one you saw, right?

794
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:17,275
It comes in two colors: Blue
and violet, which do you prefer?

795
00:55:18,115 --> 00:55:19,980
Which do you think is prettier?

796
00:55:20,751 --> 00:55:23,652
I think I prefer the violet one.

797
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,678
OK, I'll get that one then.

798
00:55:27,224 --> 00:55:29,215
Are you sure you don't want
to look at anything else?

799
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:31,993
No, thanks,
I think that's it for today.

800
00:55:33,697 --> 00:55:35,858
- Will you pay cash?
- How much is it?

801
00:55:36,500 --> 00:55:37,694
It's $ 38.

802
00:55:38,568 --> 00:55:39,762
I think I'll pay cash.

803
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,230
You can pay at the cash desk,
I'll wrap it for you.

804
00:55:43,774 --> 00:55:45,571
OK, thanks.

805
00:55:54,518 --> 00:55:56,281
It's pretty.

806
00:55:57,387 --> 00:56:00,015
If you want to exchange it,
just bring the receipt.

807
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,849
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Thank you.

808
00:56:09,299 --> 00:56:11,426
You're welcome. Thank you.

809
00:56:12,269 --> 00:56:14,362
You're welcome. Thank you.

810
00:56:15,439 --> 00:56:18,840
That one was completely different.

811
00:56:19,409 --> 00:56:21,775
She said "thank you"
looking into my eyes.

812
00:56:21,945 --> 00:56:24,880
She looked at me and said you.

813
00:56:25,449 --> 00:56:28,543
- But the best was 'you're welcome".
- You're welcome.

814
00:56:29,619 --> 00:56:31,746
Welcome to a lot of money.

815
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,819
Welcome to a lot of things
you could buy with that money.

816
00:56:35,492 --> 00:56:39,019
Welcome to how you'll be treated
after buying lots of things.

817
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:43,363
And now welcome to a sucker
welcoming a lot of things.

818
00:57:22,072 --> 00:57:23,767
Could you pass me the salt?

819
00:57:24,641 --> 00:57:26,108
- Hi!
- Hi.

820
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:27,708
Thanks.

821
00:57:30,814 --> 00:57:32,805
Do you always
have lunch here?

822
00:57:32,983 --> 00:57:34,416
Often.

823
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:37,852
- It's good. Cheap.
- It's clean.

824
00:57:38,088 --> 00:57:40,579
I used to eat in a place
near here that was dirty.

825
00:57:41,191 --> 00:57:44,319
The weigh and pay?
It's disgusting!

826
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:45,620
And expensive.

827
00:57:45,796 --> 00:57:47,991
Once I was helping myself
to bean stew.

828
00:57:48,165 --> 00:57:49,655
And I saw a wasp floating in it.

829
00:57:49,833 --> 00:57:53,599
- A wasp?
- A wasp, a bug, you know?

830
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:55,203
I complained
and the guy said...

831
00:57:55,372 --> 00:57:57,203
"It fell in,
what do you want me to do?"

832
00:57:57,374 --> 00:58:00,400
I said: "To replace
the bean stew."

833
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:04,273
He took the ladle,
fished the wasp from the stew...

834
00:58:04,448 --> 00:58:06,746
threw it in the sink
and put the ladle back.

835
00:58:06,917 --> 00:58:08,282
He didn't even wash it!

836
00:58:08,418 --> 00:58:12,286
You could see that dust they leave
floating by the sausage.

837
00:58:12,656 --> 00:58:13,748
I see.

838
00:58:13,957 --> 00:58:17,051
Imagine if I ate it?
It could be poisonous.

839
00:58:17,227 --> 00:58:20,754
I don't think they are,
not these city bugs.

840
00:58:21,298 --> 00:58:24,028
Yeah, but...
Christ, in the beans!

841
00:58:24,367 --> 00:58:25,800
Right, in the beans is too much.

842
00:58:25,969 --> 00:58:29,735
Can you imagine
that gunge in your mouth?

843
00:58:44,421 --> 00:58:46,412
Do you work near here?

844
00:58:47,324 --> 00:58:48,848
Kind of.

845
00:58:51,428 --> 00:58:53,191
What do you do?

846
00:58:56,266 --> 00:59:00,396
I... I do illustrations. I draw.

847
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:04,935
That's cool.

848
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:13,277
- Well...
- Yeah. I've finished too.

849
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,517
I have to go back.

850
00:59:24,461 --> 00:59:27,726
- Are you going that way?
- No, that way. Would you like one?

851
00:59:28,999 --> 00:59:31,797
No, thanks.
I'm not too crazy about figs.

852
00:59:32,402 --> 00:59:33,926
- Bye.
- Bye.

853
00:59:38,742 --> 00:59:41,370
She wears no perfume,
she's not crazy about figs...

854
00:59:41,545 --> 00:59:43,308
she hates wasps in beans.

855
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:45,641
And her eyes twinkle
when she smiles.

856
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:48,441
You can't see any of that
through binoculars.

857
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:52,154
Go on, ask her to come out
with us?

858
00:59:52,322 --> 00:59:53,482
I'm broke.

859
00:59:53,657 --> 00:59:57,149
Just to the movies! Then we
go to my place, order a pizza...

860
00:59:57,460 --> 00:59:59,485
No, I can't.
I have no money.

861
00:59:59,829 --> 01:00:02,662
Just the movies and a pizza.
It's less than $15.

862
01:00:02,832 --> 01:00:04,197
I can't, Cardoso.

863
01:00:06,036 --> 01:00:09,267
Man, you really are poor,
Jesus Christ!

864
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:11,337
Have you only just realized?

865
01:00:13,276 --> 01:00:15,176
What's that in your ear?

866
01:00:15,579 --> 01:00:20,346
Oh, it's a seed. Like, it squeezes
a spot in the earlobe, you know?

867
01:00:20,517 --> 01:00:21,609
A seed of what?

868
01:00:21,785 --> 01:00:25,812
It doesn't matter. It's to quit
smoking. It's apucuncture.

869
01:00:26,222 --> 01:00:27,951
- No, "acupuncture"!
- Yeah...

870
01:00:28,896 --> 01:00:31,946
Apucuncture.
-It`s name is a-CU-puncture!

871
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:35,196
Acu-puncture.
-Yeah.

872
01:00:36,023 --> 01:00:39,220
How many days has it been
since you stopped?

873
01:00:39,827 --> 01:00:41,260
- What?
- Smoking?!

874
01:00:43,664 --> 01:00:47,293
Four! But I already feel
like a different person.

875
01:00:47,467 --> 01:00:50,027
I used to get breathless
going up the stairs.

876
01:00:50,204 --> 01:00:54,698
I had no stamina. The
difference is amazing, 4 days...

877
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:55,931
Also...

878
01:00:57,578 --> 01:01:00,672
The taste of things...
much more.

879
01:01:01,982 --> 01:01:03,244
I know.

880
01:01:03,817 --> 01:01:07,275
But I can't really say
I don't miss it.

881
01:01:07,754 --> 01:01:12,350
After eating, I have a coffee,
that cigarette...

882
01:01:12,693 --> 01:01:14,558
- I know.
- The hell you do!

883
01:01:14,728 --> 01:01:18,061
I know, I quit smoking.
You never smoked!

884
01:01:19,199 --> 01:01:22,965
Shit, why did I quit smoking?
Women are bad news, man!

885
01:01:24,605 --> 01:01:28,701
She isn't even that hot.
Her tits are too big.

886
01:01:29,743 --> 01:01:32,871
Did she say the guy had
to be rich and a non-smoker?

887
01:01:33,480 --> 01:01:34,572
Yes.

888
01:01:34,748 --> 01:01:38,844
Then why don't you wait
till you get rich to stop smoking?

889
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:42,888
When she said
she was a virgin...

890
01:01:43,056 --> 01:01:47,356
she also said that
she had done everything.

891
01:01:47,928 --> 01:01:49,327
Everything!

892
01:01:49,496 --> 01:01:51,896
So, when things are getting hot,
you just go: Shlurp!

893
01:01:52,199 --> 01:01:54,759
Go on, bring your friend along!

894
01:01:54,935 --> 01:01:57,563
With a girlfriend,
women get saucy.

895
01:01:57,738 --> 01:02:00,366
They want to show off,
then we... Shlurp!

896
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:09,157
Do you know what bristly is?

897
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:13,057
- Bristly? With t-l-y?
- Yes.

898
01:02:14,497 --> 01:02:17,796
- What was the sentence?
- "The white and bristly beard".

899
01:02:20,269 --> 01:02:23,898
"White and bristly?" We should
look it up in a dictionary.

900
01:02:29,478 --> 01:02:31,070
But there are comics for adults.

901
01:02:32,214 --> 01:02:34,512
- For adults?
- For adults. The stories.

902
01:02:35,685 --> 01:02:37,084
Do you know this one?

903
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:41,415
No.

904
01:02:42,124 --> 01:02:43,614
The drawings are cool.

905
01:02:44,260 --> 01:02:46,660
- I'll lend it to you.
- Cool...

906
01:02:48,497 --> 01:02:50,863
- What about your drawings?
- What about them?

907
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:52,895
Won't you show me?

908
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:56,766
I don't have anything
like... good, finished.

909
01:02:58,341 --> 01:02:59,831
Will you do one for me?

910
01:03:02,345 --> 01:03:03,812
- Now?
- Yes.

911
01:03:04,814 --> 01:03:07,578
- No, not here.
- Why not?

912
01:03:08,217 --> 01:03:09,980
Ah, because!

913
01:03:14,223 --> 01:03:17,249
OK. I'll draw you something.

914
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:21,093
- Will you, really?
- Sure.

915
01:03:21,330 --> 01:03:22,797
What do you want me to draw?

916
01:03:22,965 --> 01:03:25,729
I don't know.
Something you like.

917
01:03:27,336 --> 01:03:28,997
Something that's nice to look at.

918
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:46,248
She arrived home holding
the comic book I'd lent her.

919
01:03:46,756 --> 01:03:48,451
I think she read it on the bus.

920
01:03:50,726 --> 01:03:53,889
She entered the house,
her house, with my book.

921
01:03:55,331 --> 01:03:59,028
She walked to the kitchen,
and came back reading my book.

922
01:04:05,941 --> 01:04:08,034
"Something that's nice
to look at..."

923
01:04:15,985 --> 01:04:17,043
Thank you.

924
01:04:18,988 --> 01:04:20,615
Do you like it?

925
01:04:20,923 --> 01:04:24,120
I do. It's very cool.
But look what I've brought you.

926
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:28,328
"Bristly..."

927
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:32,600
"covered with short, stiff hair."

928
01:04:33,335 --> 01:04:37,863
"When he smiled,
his sharp white teeth showed...

929
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:40,841
through his
bristly mulatto beard".

930
01:04:41,243 --> 01:04:45,304
Ribeiro Couto, "Largo da Matriz
and Other Stories", page 47.

931
01:04:49,552 --> 01:04:51,952
Do you want to marry me
and get away from here?

932
01:04:55,191 --> 01:04:56,522
Sure I do.

933
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:08,326
Ribeiro Couto, "Largo da Matriz
and Other Stories", page 47.

934
01:05:14,376 --> 01:05:15,673
Thank you.

935
01:05:19,315 --> 01:05:20,646
You're welcome.

936
01:05:22,651 --> 01:05:25,119
So a bristly beard
is a stiff beard.

937
01:05:26,322 --> 01:05:28,153
So, where did you get
that from?

938
01:05:28,324 --> 01:05:31,760
From a poem by Shakespeare.
A book of sonnets.

939
01:05:32,962 --> 01:05:35,487
- Do you like it?
- I only read that one.

940
01:05:35,731 --> 01:05:39,565
"When I do count the clock
that tells the time"

941
01:05:39,902 --> 01:05:41,335
It sounds like a clock.

942
01:05:42,004 --> 01:05:44,302
But where does the beard come in?

943
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:47,971
I didn't understand it at all.
I didn't even get to the end of it.

944
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:51,335
I have a present for you too.

945
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:03,149
My drawing?

946
01:06:06,162 --> 01:06:07,493
It's pretty.

947
01:06:08,964 --> 01:06:10,829
It's me in my room.

948
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:13,027
Does it look like it?

949
01:06:14,436 --> 01:06:16,063
Yes, kind of.

950
01:06:17,006 --> 01:06:19,634
I have a photo
on the window like that.

951
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,039
I know.
What's the photo of?

952
01:06:23,946 --> 01:06:26,915
It's a photo of my mom
on the Corcovado in Rio.

953
01:06:27,983 --> 01:06:30,918
- There's no TV in my room.
- Oh, no?

954
01:06:31,153 --> 01:06:32,381
No.

955
01:06:33,856 --> 01:06:35,380
I have an aquarium.

956
01:06:37,226 --> 01:06:39,319
But the rest looks
pretty much like it.

957
01:06:39,995 --> 01:06:41,587
The bed, the lamp...

958
01:06:43,232 --> 01:06:45,097
Thanks, Andre.

959
01:06:46,368 --> 01:06:49,565
- It's my birthday present.
- Oh, is it your birthday?

960
01:06:50,406 --> 01:06:52,397
It was the week before last.

961
01:06:52,575 --> 01:06:53,872
Congratulations.

962
01:07:51,600 --> 01:07:56,333
I have something wonderful here.
This is a real antique, you know.

963
01:07:56,805 --> 01:07:59,137
Put it here,
it's a very delicate piece.

964
01:07:59,441 --> 01:08:03,775
Man, this is from the last
century, 1400 and something.

965
01:08:03,946 --> 01:08:06,039
It's a beautiful piece...

966
01:08:06,215 --> 01:08:09,013
- you'll see, she'll love it.
- A little box! Pretty...

967
01:08:10,252 --> 01:08:14,348
This is for her to keep
her little knick-knacks, you see?

968
01:08:14,523 --> 01:08:15,956
Be careful.

969
01:08:16,125 --> 01:08:18,992
It's like, it's
a bit expensive. $100.

970
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:22,125
- What?
- $100.

971
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:24,357
Do you think I'd pay $100
for a tiny little box?

972
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:26,967
It's about age, not size!

973
01:08:27,136 --> 01:08:28,467
It's $80 for you.

974
01:08:28,637 --> 01:08:30,400
- No, $30.
- What?

975
01:08:30,572 --> 01:08:32,506
You're underestimating the piece.

976
01:08:32,675 --> 01:08:34,768
$30? No way. No deal.

977
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:36,844
- $ 60?
- No, I'm going home.

978
01:08:37,012 --> 01:08:39,037
Go home then. And you're not
taking the piece either.

979
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:47,587
I didn't have a $ 50 bill anymore,
only a few tests.

980
01:08:48,223 --> 01:08:50,316
A copy of a copy
doesn't come out so good.

981
01:08:56,999 --> 01:08:58,626
- $ 50.
- What?

982
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:00,729
I'll give you 50 for the box.

983
01:09:01,103 --> 01:09:03,697
No way.
$80 is as far as I'll go.

984
01:09:03,872 --> 01:09:07,569
- But you'd gone down to $60.
- Then $60 is the minimum.

985
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,535
OK, but I only have $50.

986
01:09:09,712 --> 01:09:10,974
- OK. 2 beers.
- No, wait!

987
01:09:11,146 --> 01:09:13,910
- I'll give you tomorrow.
- Can you break a 100?

988
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:18,952
- No! Wait!
- And the $25 I owed you.

989
01:09:25,661 --> 01:09:27,595
I won't mess with you, man.

990
01:09:27,763 --> 01:09:30,561
But when you gave me
those $50 at the bar...

991
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:32,530
I almost pissed myself
laughing.

992
01:09:32,701 --> 01:09:35,932
This is no antique,
it'sjust a little box.

993
01:09:36,872 --> 01:09:38,897
There's lots of them
in the storeroom, man.

994
01:09:40,175 --> 01:09:43,633
Take your $40, I'll sell it
to you for $ 10, I'm your mate.

995
01:09:47,683 --> 01:09:49,674
- There'sjust one thing.
- What?

996
01:09:50,552 --> 01:09:54,283
You know the $50 bill
I gave you yesterday?

997
01:09:55,357 --> 01:09:57,188
It was a fake.

998
01:10:02,965 --> 01:10:04,296
Are you crazy?

999
01:10:04,600 --> 01:10:07,433
I wasjust testing.
I didn't know you would use it.

1000
01:10:07,603 --> 01:10:09,230
What if the guy finds out?

1001
01:10:09,938 --> 01:10:11,462
Did you do it yourself?

1002
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:13,801
- Are there any more?
- No. Only that one.

1003
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:17,679
- It really looks real.
- No, if you look closely you see.

1004
01:10:18,847 --> 01:10:20,246
Can you make more?

1005
01:10:20,416 --> 01:10:21,940
- No, it's difficult.
- Why?

1006
01:10:22,117 --> 01:10:24,585
It wastes paper.
It has to be done in the night.

1007
01:10:24,753 --> 01:10:27,381
And I don't have a
$50 bill to copy.

1008
01:10:27,589 --> 01:10:29,113
Make a copy of a copy.

1009
01:10:29,291 --> 01:10:31,555
I've tried it,
but it doesn't work too well.

1010
01:10:33,362 --> 01:10:34,488
Look...

1011
01:10:34,997 --> 01:10:37,431
- I think I can find the money.
- How?

1012
01:10:37,766 --> 01:10:39,495
Can you do it tomorrow night?

1013
01:11:06,562 --> 01:11:08,530
Are you sick, man? Christ...

1014
01:11:09,631 --> 01:11:10,825
I am.

1015
01:11:12,301 --> 01:11:14,030
- Where's the money?
- Here.

1016
01:11:16,371 --> 01:11:18,896
Man, it's perfect, check it out!

1017
01:11:19,074 --> 01:11:21,133
Cardoso?
Those are yours.

1018
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:31,646
Here. See if it's good.

1019
01:11:34,223 --> 01:11:35,815
Yes.

1020
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:37,681
It's very good.

1021
01:11:38,260 --> 01:11:40,251
Then what do you do?
Cut them?

1022
01:11:41,330 --> 01:11:43,298
What will you do
with your share?

1023
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:45,524
I think I'll buy
Silvia a present.

1024
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:49,369
- Will you go to her shop?
- No, I'll change the money first.

1025
01:11:51,006 --> 01:11:52,598
- How's it going?
- Good.

1026
01:11:52,774 --> 01:11:54,935
- What numbers did you pick?
- The first ones.

1027
01:11:55,110 --> 01:11:57,203
- What?
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

1028
01:11:57,446 --> 01:11:59,607
Are you joking?
You didn't!

1029
01:11:59,781 --> 01:12:02,147
- Why not?
- Didn't she suspect?

1030
01:12:02,317 --> 01:12:03,614
Why?

1031
01:12:03,785 --> 01:12:06,913
Nobody picks 1-2-3-4-5-6!
It'll never be drawn.

1032
01:12:07,089 --> 01:12:09,319
The chance is tiny,
like with any sequence.

1033
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:12,456
Impossible! They'll never draw
these numbers.

1034
01:12:12,628 --> 01:12:14,493
As impossible as any sequence.

1035
01:12:14,663 --> 01:12:17,063
Now, what will you bet?
2, 4, 6, 8, 10?

1036
01:12:17,332 --> 01:12:20,392
- Good idea...
- Pay attention. Concentrate.

1037
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:25,398
Shit, it's amazing
that nobody notices.

1038
01:12:26,341 --> 01:12:28,707
Three bets of $ 9: $ 27.

1039
01:12:29,344 --> 01:12:30,971
$ 123 change.

1040
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:35,015
Welcome to all you can buy
with $ 123.

1041
01:12:35,751 --> 01:12:38,743
A sound system, books,
clothes, CDs...

1042
01:12:40,355 --> 01:12:41,652
Toys...

1043
01:12:44,293 --> 01:12:46,591
- Better!
- What is it?

1044
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:48,624
Roller blinds.

1045
01:12:49,364 --> 01:12:51,730
- Blinds?
- Yes, for your room.

1046
01:12:52,501 --> 01:12:54,366
They must
have been expensive.

1047
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:56,970
No. I traded them
for some illustrations I made.

1048
01:12:58,040 --> 01:13:00,634
Thanks. They're very cool.

1049
01:13:01,476 --> 01:13:02,670
When's your birthday?

1050
01:13:02,844 --> 01:13:05,074
- It's been already.
- I'll give you a present.

1051
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:07,540
- It was a while ago.
- But I want to.

1052
01:13:10,552 --> 01:13:13,020
Thanks. I have to get back.

1053
01:13:14,356 --> 01:13:15,516
You're welcome.

1054
01:13:20,862 --> 01:13:23,524
It took her a whole week
to put up the blinds.

1055
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:26,394
I should have paid for that too.

1056
01:13:26,735 --> 01:13:29,761
But it can't be too hard,
you Just fix it with nails.

1057
01:13:30,606 --> 01:13:31,868
I think she did it herself.

1058
01:16:12,467 --> 01:16:14,230
But... what will you do?

1059
01:16:15,704 --> 01:16:17,001
I don't know.

1060
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:19,140
You can't tell her:
"Your dad's a pervert."

1061
01:16:19,307 --> 01:16:21,832
- Or she would find it weird.
- Yes.

1062
01:16:22,577 --> 01:16:24,875
You could hint it,
just in passing:

1063
01:16:25,046 --> 01:16:27,810
"Do you know that many
fathers are perverts?"

1064
01:16:27,983 --> 01:16:29,382
"It's quite common."

1065
01:16:29,551 --> 01:16:32,884
"You should put a towel like this
when you shower..."

1066
01:16:33,288 --> 01:16:35,552
But I think she'll find that
weird too.

1067
01:16:35,724 --> 01:16:37,021
Yes, she will.

1068
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:41,920
You could also get some guys
to beat him up.

1069
01:16:42,097 --> 01:16:44,065
And while they're at it,
tell him:

1070
01:16:44,232 --> 01:16:47,201
"You're getting this because
you're a pervert" and pow!

1071
01:16:49,805 --> 01:16:51,534
But then he'll think it weird,
won't he?

1072
01:16:53,708 --> 01:16:57,007
You could also do this: Marry her.

1073
01:16:58,246 --> 01:17:00,908
But to do that,
you'll need money...

1074
01:17:01,082 --> 01:17:04,210
Somewhere to take her...
And money.

1075
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:06,351
Real money.

1076
01:17:06,521 --> 01:17:09,319
That money you found won't do.

1077
01:17:09,825 --> 01:17:12,487
And do you have any idea
where you could find real money?

1078
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:16,091
Yeah.

1079
01:17:42,190 --> 01:17:44,158
Give me
half your salary?

1080
01:17:44,326 --> 01:17:46,521
Sorry, I had to take
my mom to the doctor.

1081
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:50,592
There's lots of work for you.
And it's all for tomorrow.

1082
01:17:50,966 --> 01:17:52,991
OK, I'll stay late.
Thanks.

1083
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:33,705
How long?

1084
01:18:34,242 --> 01:18:37,075
I don't know yet.
It depends on the work.

1085
01:18:39,180 --> 01:18:42,343
- More than a year?
- No, around 6 months, maximum.

1086
01:18:46,221 --> 01:18:48,212
I've always wanted to go to Rio.

1087
01:18:48,523 --> 01:18:52,357
Maybe you can come visit me
on your vacations.

1088
01:18:53,828 --> 01:18:55,625
That will be a while.

1089
01:18:58,466 --> 01:18:59,558
Look...

1090
01:19:01,136 --> 01:19:02,797
I've brought you a present.

1091
01:19:04,606 --> 01:19:06,574
Take it on your trip, read it.

1092
01:19:07,676 --> 01:19:09,507
It's marked on the page...

1093
01:19:11,112 --> 01:19:14,377
"When I do count the clock
that tells the time".

1094
01:19:14,916 --> 01:19:16,315
Did you understand it?

1095
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:18,883
I did.

1096
01:19:20,555 --> 01:19:22,045
It's beautiful.

1097
01:19:24,092 --> 01:19:26,822
"When I do count the clock
that tells the time.

1098
01:19:27,228 --> 01:19:30,129
And see the brave day sunk
in hideous night.

1099
01:19:30,298 --> 01:19:33,199
When I behold the violet
past prime."

1100
01:19:33,368 --> 01:19:39,432
To sink here means to disappear,
wither, die. The withered flower.

1101
01:19:40,342 --> 01:19:43,743
"And sable curls,
all wither'd o'er with white."

1102
01:19:44,579 --> 01:19:47,047
When the hair grays on the sides.

1103
01:19:47,849 --> 01:19:50,340
"When lofty trees I see
barren of leaves.

1104
01:19:50,685 --> 01:19:54,052
Which erst from heat
did canopy the heard."

1105
01:19:54,322 --> 01:19:56,381
The leafless tree...

1106
01:19:57,826 --> 01:20:01,592
where the cattle used to go
for shadow, when it had leaves.

1107
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:07,034
"And summer's green
all girded up in sheaves.

1108
01:20:07,202 --> 01:20:09,864
Borne on the bier with white
and bristly beard.

1109
01:20:10,038 --> 01:20:12,666
The hay being taken away
on a cart."

1110
01:20:15,343 --> 01:20:16,571
Yes.

1111
01:20:17,379 --> 01:20:19,506
The white and bristly beard.

1112
01:20:20,615 --> 01:20:22,412
It's about time, Andre.

1113
01:20:24,119 --> 01:20:25,586
The passing of time.

1114
01:20:27,656 --> 01:20:30,682
"Then of thy beauty
do I question make.

1115
01:20:30,859 --> 01:20:33,726
That thou amongst
the wastes of time must go."

1116
01:20:33,895 --> 01:20:36,363
- That's...
- Yes, I get it.

1117
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:43,702
"Since sweets and beauties
do themselves forsake.

1118
01:20:44,606 --> 01:20:47,097
And die as fast
as they see others grow.

1119
01:20:49,310 --> 01:20:52,575
And nothing 'gainst time's scythe
can make defense.

1120
01:20:52,914 --> 01:20:55,781
Save breed to brave him
when he takes thee hence."

1121
01:20:57,585 --> 01:20:58,984
What's that?

1122
01:21:02,323 --> 01:21:04,382
It's a way of beating death.

1123
01:21:05,827 --> 01:21:07,556
Of deceiving time.

1124
01:21:08,763 --> 01:21:10,230
Breed. Children.

1125
01:21:15,236 --> 01:21:18,364
I understand it.
It is really beautiful.

1126
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:21,607
Thank you.

1127
01:21:25,013 --> 01:21:27,174
- I have to get back to work.
- OK, sure.

1128
01:21:29,884 --> 01:21:31,078
Silvia?

1129
01:21:34,989 --> 01:21:36,923
Will you wait for me?

1130
01:21:40,929 --> 01:21:42,294
I will.

1131
01:21:46,534 --> 01:21:47,762
Do you...

1132
01:21:49,070 --> 01:21:52,335
Do you want to marry me
and get away from here?

1133
01:21:55,577 --> 01:21:57,442
Sure I do.

1134
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:19,758
It may take about six months.

1135
01:22:20,001 --> 01:22:21,525
I'll wait.

1136
01:22:23,138 --> 01:22:25,163
I'll wait even longer,
if I have to.

1137
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:28,775
Take care.

1138
01:22:43,458 --> 01:22:46,621
Wimp.
Watch what you do with it.

1139
01:22:47,395 --> 01:22:48,521
And the bullets?

1140
01:22:48,696 --> 01:22:50,926
- There are five in there.
- Only five?

1141
01:22:51,466 --> 01:22:53,434
If you need five you're screwed.

1142
01:22:54,068 --> 01:22:57,697
But then,
if you need one you're screwed.

1143
01:23:21,429 --> 01:23:22,691
Where were you?

1144
01:23:22,864 --> 01:23:24,923
You didn't even see me
get here.

1145
01:23:31,206 --> 01:23:32,468
Look. The other guy?

1146
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:36,667
I'll be pointing the gun at one
of them. The other won't shoot.

1147
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:39,746
- What if he does?
- Then I'll shoot too.

1148
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:42,778
Will you kill the guy?

1149
01:23:42,951 --> 01:23:43,940
I hope not.

1150
01:23:46,254 --> 01:23:48,620
I'll stay in the car.
I've nothing to do with this.

1151
01:23:49,490 --> 01:23:51,651
If they catch you,
I'll tell them I don't know you.

1152
01:23:51,826 --> 01:23:54,090
- I only gave you a ride.
- OK.

1153
01:23:54,562 --> 01:23:56,757
- And if you shoot anyone, I'm out.
- OK.

1154
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:59,428
If it works,
half the money's mine.

1155
01:23:59,601 --> 01:24:02,365
OK. Just wait me with the car.

1156
01:24:04,439 --> 01:24:05,599
When?

1157
01:24:06,241 --> 01:24:07,230
Tomorrow.

1158
01:24:07,508 --> 01:24:08,998
You get the car.

1159
01:24:47,148 --> 01:24:51,778
Money is only paper that
people believe is worth something.

1160
01:24:57,725 --> 01:25:00,455
If nobody believes it,
it's useless.

1161
01:25:04,465 --> 01:25:06,695
Here I go!

1162
01:25:35,596 --> 01:25:37,120
What do you want?

1163
01:25:37,465 --> 01:25:39,490
Good morning.

1164
01:25:40,568 --> 01:25:43,196
- I'm doing a survey.
- What?

1165
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:47,798
I'm doing a survey...
for school, about music.

1166
01:25:49,243 --> 01:25:50,733
What survey is that?

1167
01:25:50,912 --> 01:25:54,507
It's a survey about
the kind of music people prefer.

1168
01:25:54,682 --> 01:25:56,707
Would you answer
a few questions?

1169
01:25:57,685 --> 01:25:59,880
You want to know
my favorite kind of music?

1170
01:26:00,054 --> 01:26:01,453
Yes.

1171
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:04,451
- Rock.
- Rock?

1172
01:26:05,460 --> 01:26:07,553
And do you have
a favorite band?

1173
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:10,420
Creedence.

1174
01:26:11,132 --> 01:26:12,793
OK, thanks.

1175
01:26:47,902 --> 01:26:49,733
Drop the gun! Drop it!

1176
01:26:50,872 --> 01:26:51,861
Drop the bag!

1177
01:26:52,540 --> 01:26:54,098
Get in the car! Hurry!

1178
01:26:55,043 --> 01:26:56,533
Come on, get in!

1179
01:27:34,082 --> 01:27:35,549
- Don't you see me?
- What?

1180
01:27:35,716 --> 01:27:38,150
The parking meter, man.
I didn't have a coin.

1181
01:27:51,799 --> 01:27:53,096
Just a minute...

1182
01:28:01,776 --> 01:28:03,107
Just a second.

1183
01:28:05,913 --> 01:28:06,971
Please.

1184
01:28:08,816 --> 01:28:09,840
A second more.

1185
01:28:10,017 --> 01:28:12,212
A lower bill.
Get a lower one.

1186
01:28:56,898 --> 01:28:59,867
I was thinking of getting
my hair cut really short.

1187
01:29:00,234 --> 01:29:01,929
And selling the rest.

1188
01:29:02,370 --> 01:29:05,237
They pay $ 500 for hair
like mine, you know?

1189
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:08,737
They've offered me $ 300.
But I didn't cut it.

1190
01:29:09,076 --> 01:29:10,737
I'll only have it cut for $ 600.

1191
01:29:11,812 --> 01:29:15,680
I wasjust thinking: My
hair takes three months to grow.

1192
01:29:16,050 --> 01:29:19,679
If I cut it in the full moon and
eat lots of carrots and cucumbers.

1193
01:29:19,921 --> 01:29:22,788
It's $ 600.
$ 200 a month.

1194
01:29:23,791 --> 01:29:27,090
$ 200 to grow hair?
It's more than I earn here.

1195
01:29:27,895 --> 01:29:28,953
Occupation...

1196
01:29:29,664 --> 01:29:31,256
Hair garden!

1197
01:29:33,134 --> 01:29:35,102
Wait, let me take a look here.

1198
01:29:36,237 --> 01:29:38,933
Short hair, by the way,
is much more practical.

1199
01:29:39,106 --> 01:29:41,199
THIEF RUNS AWAY ON FOOT
WITH $ 2 MILLION

1200
01:29:41,375 --> 01:29:43,866
You never comb your hair, I know.

1201
01:29:44,612 --> 01:29:45,909
Look.

1202
01:29:46,447 --> 01:29:50,042
OK. It doesn't look like you.
It looks like Romario.

1203
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:51,549
No, the headline below.

1204
01:29:51,719 --> 01:29:53,619
- "The new lottery."
- No, the other one.

1205
01:29:54,855 --> 01:29:56,117
"Drug dealer arrested
with fake money."

1206
01:29:56,290 --> 01:29:58,815
"Jeferson Feitosa
was arrested yesterday...

1207
01:29:58,993 --> 01:30:01,621
as he tried to pass a fake bill
of $50 at a nightclub."

1208
01:30:02,163 --> 01:30:04,859
"He had also other 5 bills..."

1209
01:30:05,933 --> 01:30:08,595
"6 bills of $ 50..." Is he the guy
you bought the gun from?

1210
01:30:12,306 --> 01:30:14,399
And the fingerprints
on the gun?

1211
01:30:14,575 --> 01:30:16,406
- Are his.
- It's alright then.

1212
01:30:18,312 --> 01:30:21,008
Did you realize they said
the counterfeits were bad?

1213
01:30:21,182 --> 01:30:23,082
- No.
- It's here...

1214
01:30:23,985 --> 01:30:27,682
"Badly made counterfeits
lead drug dealer tojail."

1215
01:30:28,256 --> 01:30:31,623
Without my help, your performance
as a forger is terrible.

1216
01:30:35,129 --> 01:30:36,153
What?

1217
01:30:38,065 --> 01:30:40,226
"The new lottery winner
has not yet appeared...

1218
01:30:40,401 --> 01:30:42,335
to receive
his $ 4 million prize.

1219
01:30:42,503 --> 01:30:46,303
The numbers drawn are an
amazing sequence of 1, 2, 3, 4..."

1220
01:30:51,012 --> 01:30:56,177
What is this, man?
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Fucking hell!

1221
01:30:56,717 --> 01:30:59,345
Shut up!

1222
01:31:00,621 --> 01:31:02,748
We've won! We've won!

1223
01:31:13,734 --> 01:31:17,033
Sing a song of sixpence
A pocket full of rye

1224
01:31:18,272 --> 01:31:20,467
What if we returned
the stolen money?

1225
01:31:20,808 --> 01:31:23,174
- How?
- I don't know! By mail.

1226
01:31:23,878 --> 01:31:26,403
What for?
I robbed a bank, I shot a guy.

1227
01:31:26,580 --> 01:31:28,639
Can you see my photo
on the paper...

1228
01:31:28,816 --> 01:31:30,443
"The new lottery millionaire"?

1229
01:31:32,053 --> 01:31:33,645
So there's only one way.

1230
01:31:33,821 --> 01:31:36,585
You must give someone
the lottery ticket.

1231
01:31:36,757 --> 01:31:40,022
Someone who knows how to
deal with money, who's classy.

1232
01:31:40,194 --> 01:31:41,991
Someone you trust.

1233
01:31:42,163 --> 01:31:44,927
Someone you're absolutely
sure won't screw you.

1234
01:31:47,068 --> 01:31:48,433
You're right.

1235
01:31:49,103 --> 01:31:51,503
Once again,
congratulations for the prize.

1236
01:31:52,740 --> 01:31:55,106
Would you like
some of the money in cash?

1237
01:31:56,143 --> 01:31:59,112
$ 6,000.
For small expenses.

1238
01:32:00,414 --> 01:32:02,314
Yes, I think it's all settled.

1239
01:32:03,384 --> 01:32:05,181
Do you want to know
the password?

1240
01:32:07,154 --> 01:32:10,920
So, I want to know
everything you've done.

1241
01:32:15,529 --> 01:32:16,587
The password is...

1242
01:32:16,797 --> 01:32:20,164
5, 65, 5.

1243
01:32:21,402 --> 01:32:23,233
They're my measurements.

1244
01:32:23,404 --> 01:32:25,872
- Do you want to write it down?
- No, it's OK.

1245
01:32:26,607 --> 01:32:29,041
And what are we going to do
with this money?

1246
01:32:29,610 --> 01:32:31,669
With this money, nothing yet.

1247
01:32:31,846 --> 01:32:34,144
This is dangerous money,
it's numbered.

1248
01:32:35,383 --> 01:32:37,078
And with the prize?

1249
01:32:37,385 --> 01:32:38,818
Spend it!

1250
01:32:48,929 --> 01:32:50,556
- V-6 engine...
- Lovely.

1251
01:32:50,731 --> 01:32:53,461
- 3 valves per cylinder.
- A lot of valves.

1252
01:32:53,634 --> 01:32:55,295
- Side finishing in carbon fiber.
- Excellent.

1253
01:33:12,820 --> 01:33:14,378
- 8 airbags!
- Wow!

1254
01:33:14,555 --> 01:33:16,147
In the front and sides.

1255
01:33:22,797 --> 01:33:24,628
The windshield wiper turns
itself on and off.

1256
01:33:24,799 --> 01:33:29,202
Good! 'Cause sometimes your mind
is somewhere else.

1257
01:33:29,370 --> 01:33:31,895
Man, this is the car!
Do you have it in silver?

1258
01:33:49,957 --> 01:33:52,084
Why is this shit silver
instead of black?

1259
01:34:04,271 --> 01:34:05,829
What's Rio like?

1260
01:34:06,340 --> 01:34:07,864
Is it nice?

1261
01:34:08,175 --> 01:34:09,369
Yes.

1262
01:34:09,910 --> 01:34:12,140
I want you to go there with me.

1263
01:34:13,747 --> 01:34:18,081
Antunes won't let us leave
like that. He'll come after us.

1264
01:34:19,887 --> 01:34:21,514
We'll get married.

1265
01:34:22,490 --> 01:34:23,923
Even so.

1266
01:34:25,392 --> 01:34:28,361
What's the problem?
I'll talk to him.

1267
01:34:33,167 --> 01:34:34,464
Will you?

1268
01:34:36,337 --> 01:34:37,702
Yes.

1269
01:34:38,072 --> 01:34:39,801
- You said silver.
- I said black.

1270
01:34:40,474 --> 01:34:43,807
Let's not start this again
it annoys me!

1271
01:34:44,144 --> 01:34:45,202
But you said silver.

1272
01:34:45,379 --> 01:34:47,711
I said black,
I'm wearing my black dress!

1273
01:34:49,183 --> 01:34:50,616
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

1274
01:34:50,818 --> 01:34:54,948
Cardoso, at your service.
Marinez, my fiancée.

1275
01:34:55,322 --> 01:34:58,587
We'd like to enjoy the comforts
of a Presidential Suite.

1276
01:34:59,126 --> 01:35:02,357
It is unavailable right now.
Do you have a reservation?

1277
01:35:02,696 --> 01:35:04,755
What do you mean?

1278
01:35:05,132 --> 01:35:06,599
I'll make one now then.

1279
01:35:07,434 --> 01:35:08,992
No, please.
It's not necessary.

1280
01:35:09,169 --> 01:35:11,729
We have 3 types of room,
all very good.

1281
01:35:11,906 --> 01:35:12,964
Yes? What types?

1282
01:35:13,140 --> 01:35:17,133
Luxury rooms, grand luxury rooms
and a special grand luxury suite.

1283
01:35:18,579 --> 01:35:21,343
The special grand luxury.

1284
01:35:21,782 --> 01:35:24,012
As you wish.
Do you have any luggage?

1285
01:35:24,184 --> 01:35:26,516
Yes, it's in the silver Mercedes.

1286
01:35:26,820 --> 01:35:29,311
I don't like black.
It gets dirty too easily.

1287
01:35:29,924 --> 01:35:31,186
Perfect.

1288
01:35:31,759 --> 01:35:33,317
It's a double bed, isn't it?

1289
01:35:33,794 --> 01:35:35,557
Double King Size bed.

1290
01:35:35,996 --> 01:35:37,361
Double King Size?

1291
01:35:37,531 --> 01:35:39,556
Double King Size.
It's very big.

1292
01:36:11,432 --> 01:36:13,900
Do you think he'll like me?

1293
01:36:14,068 --> 01:36:15,467
I hope not.

1294
01:36:15,636 --> 01:36:17,194
Why?

1295
01:36:18,138 --> 01:36:20,129
Antunes is a scumbag.

1296
01:36:20,307 --> 01:36:22,468
- Your father?
- I take after my mother.

1297
01:36:22,643 --> 01:36:25,976
- What kind of a scumbag?
- The worst kind.

1298
01:36:32,486 --> 01:36:34,078
Andre, Antunes, Andre.

1299
01:36:47,267 --> 01:36:49,531
- How old are you?
- 1.

1300
01:36:52,172 --> 01:36:53,571
What do you do?

1301
01:36:53,841 --> 01:36:56,275
Andre draws.
For magazines.

1302
01:36:57,011 --> 01:36:58,569
He draws really well.

1303
01:37:00,347 --> 01:37:02,815
- How did you meet?
- At the shop.

1304
01:37:02,983 --> 01:37:05,076
Andre came in to buy a present
for his mother.

1305
01:37:10,457 --> 01:37:11,856
What are we drinking?

1306
01:37:39,887 --> 01:37:42,082
- Can I have a glass of water?
- No.

1307
01:37:53,133 --> 01:37:55,124
- What's your name?
- Andre.

1308
01:37:58,172 --> 01:38:01,505
Listen here, Andre. I know
it was you who robbed that bank.

1309
01:38:02,509 --> 01:38:04,875
It was you who
shot me in the leg.

1310
01:38:05,412 --> 01:38:11,009
If I blow the whistle on you,
you'll get what? 15 years in jail?

1311
01:38:13,187 --> 01:38:15,348
But I don't care about that.

1312
01:38:15,622 --> 01:38:19,388
I know you have the money.
I don't even want all of it.

1313
01:38:22,229 --> 01:38:24,663
If you want to marry Silvia,
it's your problem.

1314
01:38:25,499 --> 01:38:29,401
But if I had your money,
at your age...

1315
01:38:29,837 --> 01:38:33,329
I'd find myself something better,
much better.

1316
01:38:42,049 --> 01:38:43,710
I can't go to bed late.

1317
01:39:14,381 --> 01:39:15,973
New outfit, Andre?

1318
01:39:19,386 --> 01:39:21,946
- Your girlfriend?
- No, friend.

1319
01:39:22,256 --> 01:39:24,520
Good, then I can check her out.

1320
01:39:25,025 --> 01:39:28,893
Hot. She lives at the Santa
Cecilia, near your place, right?

1321
01:39:39,306 --> 01:39:41,331
I read that
you'd been arrested.

1322
01:39:41,508 --> 01:39:45,672
Yes, but I got out fast. When you
have friends, you have everything.

1323
01:39:46,013 --> 01:39:48,106
Like you.
You were my friend.

1324
01:39:48,348 --> 01:39:52,148
That's why I sold you that gun
so cheap. Six bills of $ 50.

1325
01:39:53,287 --> 01:39:56,222
- I really needed the gun.
- I know, I heard.

1326
01:39:56,623 --> 01:39:58,386
$ 2 million, very good.

1327
01:39:58,792 --> 01:40:01,260
They wouldn't let me go
because of my fingerprints.

1328
01:40:01,428 --> 01:40:03,589
But I was lucky I had an alibi.

1329
01:40:04,231 --> 01:40:05,528
What do you want?

1330
01:40:06,066 --> 01:40:09,058
What do I want?!
The money.

1331
01:40:09,236 --> 01:40:10,430
Why do you think
you're still alive?

1332
01:40:10,604 --> 01:40:13,300
- I'll give you the money!
- I know. Let's get it!

1333
01:40:13,473 --> 01:40:15,441
It isn't at my place.
Do you think I'm a sucker?

1334
01:40:15,609 --> 01:40:17,440
Yes. And a wimp!

1335
01:40:18,579 --> 01:40:21,139
The money is at a friend's.

1336
01:40:21,648 --> 01:40:23,309
I'll give it to you tomorrow.

1337
01:40:23,483 --> 01:40:25,383
Do you think I'm a sucker?

1338
01:40:26,753 --> 01:40:29,745
Do you think I'll run away?

1339
01:40:29,923 --> 01:40:31,151
You know where I live.

1340
01:40:31,325 --> 01:40:33,190
Where your friend lives.

1341
01:40:35,262 --> 01:40:36,490
Right.

1342
01:40:38,966 --> 01:40:40,831
I won't run away.

1343
01:40:41,301 --> 01:40:43,269
Tomorrow I'll give you the money.

1344
01:40:46,240 --> 01:40:48,105
On the stairs, at the bridge.

1345
01:40:48,976 --> 01:40:50,876
No, it's too busy.

1346
01:40:51,812 --> 01:40:54,804
On the other side.
It's a bag full of money.

1347
01:40:54,982 --> 01:40:56,347
What time?

1348
01:40:56,850 --> 01:40:59,250
11 o'clock.
11:15, latest.

1349
01:40:59,853 --> 01:41:03,482
I'll wait till 11:30. If you don't
show up, I'll go get you.

1350
01:41:03,657 --> 01:41:07,058
You, your mother and your friend.
Got it?

1351
01:41:07,995 --> 01:41:09,986
- I'll be there.
- I know you will.

1352
01:41:10,364 --> 01:41:13,197
You've always been a sucker.
A sucker and a wimp!

1353
01:42:00,013 --> 01:42:02,607
I KNOW IT ALL.

1354
01:42:12,759 --> 01:42:15,159
I WANT TO SEE YOU.

1355
01:42:15,429 --> 01:42:18,592
NOW.

1356
01:42:20,000 --> 01:42:23,128
CAN I COME OVER?

1357
01:42:25,238 --> 01:42:29,368
YES.
FLASH YOUR LIGHT 3 TIMES.

1358
01:42:29,810 --> 01:42:32,643
NO,
FLASH YOUR LIGHT 15 TIMES.

1359
01:43:06,413 --> 01:43:08,779
Did he tell you
or did you find out?

1360
01:43:09,216 --> 01:43:10,843
He told me.

1361
01:43:11,385 --> 01:43:12,943
What did he say?

1362
01:43:14,254 --> 01:43:16,085
That you were the robber.

1363
01:43:17,557 --> 01:43:19,684
That you had shot him in the leg.

1364
01:43:20,460 --> 01:43:22,018
And you?

1365
01:43:25,499 --> 01:43:27,126
I said nothing, Andre.

1366
01:43:30,604 --> 01:43:33,164
That's when I understood
your look in the restaurant.

1367
01:43:34,307 --> 01:43:37,470
- He told you he knew, didn't he?
- Yes, he did.

1368
01:43:41,615 --> 01:43:45,984
He'll keep after us, Andre.
It's no use running away.

1369
01:43:47,120 --> 01:43:49,418
I think we'd better
give him the money.

1370
01:43:49,589 --> 01:43:51,056
No!

1371
01:43:51,992 --> 01:43:53,789
He'll just spend it all.

1372
01:43:54,661 --> 01:43:56,288
He'll get arrested
and denounce you.

1373
01:43:56,496 --> 01:44:00,023
I'm not talking about the robbery
money, but the prize money.

1374
01:44:02,469 --> 01:44:04,198
I'd rather kill him.

1375
01:44:06,273 --> 01:44:08,173
But he's your father.

1376
01:44:09,176 --> 01:44:10,473
So what?

1377
01:44:10,644 --> 01:44:14,375
- So you can't kill your father.
- Why not?

1378
01:44:15,115 --> 01:44:18,551
Because he's your father,
he put you in this world.

1379
01:44:18,718 --> 01:44:20,743
Because without him
you wouldn't exist.

1380
01:44:21,621 --> 01:44:23,179
Gratitude?

1381
01:44:24,791 --> 01:44:26,418
Is that it?

1382
01:44:27,427 --> 01:44:29,054
Will I have
to be forever grateful...

1383
01:44:29,229 --> 01:44:31,493
to a guy who slept
with my mother 18 years ago?

1384
01:44:32,833 --> 01:44:34,824
He didn't want her to have me.

1385
01:44:35,502 --> 01:44:37,197
She didn't want me
to be his either.

1386
01:44:39,072 --> 01:44:41,370
My mother was crazy
about another guy.

1387
01:44:41,541 --> 01:44:43,270
A gorgeous guy.

1388
01:44:43,443 --> 01:44:45,138
She had a photo of him.

1389
01:44:46,279 --> 01:44:48,543
He was an artist.
He moved to Rio.

1390
01:44:49,916 --> 01:44:52,248
My mother thought I was his.

1391
01:44:52,586 --> 01:44:54,144
I think so too.

1392
01:44:55,956 --> 01:44:57,514
But he left.

1393
01:44:59,459 --> 01:45:01,393
She was engaged to Antunes.

1394
01:45:02,062 --> 01:45:03,757
She ended up marrying him.

1395
01:45:07,100 --> 01:45:09,227
My mother died
very young, Andre.

1396
01:45:10,971 --> 01:45:12,461
At 41.

1397
01:45:14,841 --> 01:45:16,399
She smoked a lot.

1398
01:45:20,480 --> 01:45:23,005
You can't imagine
what a scumbag Antunes is.

1399
01:45:27,120 --> 01:45:30,954
Can you believe he still spies
on me when I'm having a shower?

1400
01:45:31,758 --> 01:45:32,952
Yes.

1401
01:45:36,429 --> 01:45:38,329
Yes, I can kill him.

1402
01:45:46,239 --> 01:45:48,173
This money is yours, Andre.

1403
01:45:52,078 --> 01:45:54,171
Let's kill him
and run away to Rio?

1404
01:45:56,917 --> 01:45:58,214
Let's?

1405
01:46:09,095 --> 01:46:11,086
What do you do
besides drawing?

1406
01:46:12,098 --> 01:46:14,259
And copying money
and robbing banks?

1407
01:46:17,938 --> 01:46:19,235
Silvia...

1408
01:46:20,840 --> 01:46:22,967
I'm a photocopier operator.

1409
01:46:31,518 --> 01:46:35,113
I've always dreamt of marrying
a photocopier operator.

1410
01:46:37,390 --> 01:46:39,085
I'll marry you!

1411
01:46:40,660 --> 01:46:42,127
When, tomorrow?

1412
01:46:43,396 --> 01:46:45,864
No, the day after tomorrow.

1413
01:46:47,133 --> 01:46:48,862
Why not tomorrow?

1414
01:46:49,869 --> 01:46:52,201
I have to sort
something out tomorrow.

1415
01:47:24,471 --> 01:47:25,665
You're late.

1416
01:47:25,839 --> 01:47:27,238
I thought I was
being followed.

1417
01:47:27,407 --> 01:47:28,635
You've got it?

1418
01:47:29,175 --> 01:47:31,143
- Do you want to check it?
- Sure I do!

1419
01:47:32,245 --> 01:47:34,110
- It's all there, I have to go.
- Wait.

1420
01:47:34,414 --> 01:47:36,041
- No, I have to go.
- Wait!

1421
01:47:36,850 --> 01:47:38,283
What's this, Andre?

1422
01:48:44,617 --> 01:48:46,414
Wimp!

1423
01:48:53,760 --> 01:48:55,819
I may be a wimp.

1424
01:48:56,129 --> 01:48:58,097
But I'm not a sucker.

1425
01:48:58,264 --> 01:49:00,164
I said it was
dangerous toJump.

1426
01:49:00,533 --> 01:49:02,558
HeJumped because
he wanted to.

1427
01:49:04,938 --> 01:49:07,736
A sea lion,
weighing over half a ton...

1428
01:49:07,907 --> 01:49:11,035
was the attraction
at Casino beach.

1429
01:49:11,211 --> 01:49:14,339
Fishermen believe
it got lost in a current...

1430
01:49:14,514 --> 01:49:16,778
or caught in a fishing net.

1431
01:49:18,985 --> 01:49:20,179
Mom...

1432
01:49:23,022 --> 01:49:24,717
Mom, I'm going away.

1433
01:49:25,892 --> 01:49:29,885
- Where?
- To Holland. It's all paid for.

1434
01:49:30,063 --> 01:49:33,089
I'm going to be best man
at Marinez' wedding.

1435
01:49:33,466 --> 01:49:35,934
Her fiancé sent us the tickets.
He's very rich.

1436
01:49:38,071 --> 01:49:40,005
When are you coming back?

1437
01:49:41,508 --> 01:49:44,773
Soon. It will be only
for a few days.

1438
01:49:45,011 --> 01:49:47,605
But I'm leaving you
the rent money.

1439
01:49:47,781 --> 01:49:50,181
- Do you have warm clothes?
- Yes, I do.

1440
01:49:50,383 --> 01:49:52,374
It's very cold in Holland.

1441
01:49:52,819 --> 01:49:54,411
I have clothes, mom.

1442
01:49:56,189 --> 01:49:59,784
Good night, son. I'm going to bed.
TV makes me so sleepy...

1443
01:50:00,760 --> 01:50:02,022
Mom?

1444
01:50:04,831 --> 01:50:05,923
Good night.

1445
01:50:06,599 --> 01:50:08,157
Good night, Andre.

1446
01:50:14,073 --> 01:50:17,133
- I couldn't find parking.
- Open your mouth.

1447
01:50:17,310 --> 01:50:18,709
- What?
- Do it!

1448
01:50:18,878 --> 01:50:21,346
Cardoso. This is Silvia.

1449
01:50:21,848 --> 01:50:24,009
I'm Cardoso, at your service.

1450
01:50:24,184 --> 01:50:25,708
- Do you smoke?
- No.

1451
01:50:25,885 --> 01:50:28,149
- Me neither.
- Congratulations.

1452
01:50:28,354 --> 01:50:30,151
Well, we... Cardoso?

1453
01:50:31,458 --> 01:50:34,621
We have a plan.
It's not very good, but...

1454
01:50:34,928 --> 01:50:37,260
Let's give her father
the money.

1455
01:50:37,430 --> 01:50:38,761
I mean, the robbery money.

1456
01:50:38,932 --> 01:50:40,297
I don't have half of it even.

1457
01:50:40,467 --> 01:50:42,332
And the police have
the numbers of these bills.

1458
01:50:42,502 --> 01:50:45,471
- He'll end up arrested.
- So what?

1459
01:50:46,573 --> 01:50:49,371
I mean, if we are not
going to be here...

1460
01:50:49,542 --> 01:50:51,373
If he's arrested,
he'll turn me in too.

1461
01:50:51,544 --> 01:50:56,277
We could give him
some of the prize money.

1462
01:50:56,883 --> 01:51:00,546
No way, Andre. He'll want more,
he'll want it all.

1463
01:51:00,854 --> 01:51:02,185
So what's the plan?

1464
01:51:02,989 --> 01:51:06,117
Silvia wrote a letter to Antunes
as if she were in Rio.

1465
01:51:06,292 --> 01:51:09,318
She asked a friend to send
the letter from Rio.

1466
01:51:09,829 --> 01:51:12,855
Cardoso will put the money
in a bag and get a chicken.

1467
01:51:13,466 --> 01:51:14,865
- What's the chicken for?
- Wait.

1468
01:51:15,702 --> 01:51:18,603
Marinez will keep Antunes in the
bar for as long as possible.

1469
01:51:19,739 --> 01:51:23,072
Cardoso and I will go
to Silvia's apartment.

1470
01:51:23,977 --> 01:51:25,945
- I'll prepare the bomb.
- Bomb?!

1471
01:51:26,779 --> 01:51:28,713
Are you going
to kill her father?

1472
01:51:29,082 --> 01:51:30,515
He's not my father.

1473
01:51:30,683 --> 01:51:32,014
Even so.

1474
01:51:32,652 --> 01:51:34,176
He's a scumbag.

1475
01:52:19,699 --> 01:52:21,098
I don't want to kill anyone!

1476
01:52:21,267 --> 01:52:24,259
Marinez, you only have
to keep him in the bar.

1477
01:52:24,437 --> 01:52:26,530
So you think
I could be a model?

1478
01:52:26,706 --> 01:52:27,764
OK. Go on.

1479
01:52:28,107 --> 01:52:30,337
- What's the chicken for?
- You'll see.

1480
01:52:31,244 --> 01:52:33,303
We'll meet in the car
and call the firemen.

1481
01:52:33,479 --> 01:52:35,037
A strong smell of gas...

1482
01:52:35,348 --> 01:52:38,010
- Then we take off to Rio.
- Give me the keys! I'll drive.

1483
01:52:39,252 --> 01:52:40,310
You have them.

1484
01:52:40,486 --> 01:52:42,977
No, I gave them to you
with the car documents.

1485
01:53:11,951 --> 01:53:12,940
Hello?

1486
01:53:13,252 --> 01:53:15,243
Hi, honey, how are you?

1487
01:53:16,089 --> 01:53:17,113
Who is it?

1488
01:53:17,790 --> 01:53:21,453
Have you already forgotten me?
We'vejust met at the bar.

1489
01:53:22,762 --> 01:53:25,492
Sure, sure.
I'm glad you called.

1490
01:53:26,633 --> 01:53:28,794
Tell me,
are you on a cordless phone?

1491
01:53:29,268 --> 01:53:30,997
No.
I don't have a cordless phone.

1492
01:53:32,271 --> 01:53:35,365
The connection isn't very good,
where are you then?

1493
01:53:36,275 --> 01:53:38,243
I'm in the living room, at home.

1494
01:53:38,845 --> 01:53:40,278
Oh, in the living room, great!

1495
01:53:42,615 --> 01:53:44,776
I..., just a minute, OK?

1496
01:53:45,118 --> 01:53:47,382
- What happened?
- There's some people here.

1497
01:53:48,287 --> 01:53:50,187
Oh. OK, then. Bye.

1498
01:53:50,690 --> 01:53:52,715
Hello?

1499
01:53:54,994 --> 01:53:56,427
What's going on?

1500
01:53:56,996 --> 01:53:58,327
My jacket.

1501
01:53:58,498 --> 01:54:00,989
I haven't introduced you.
This is Cardoso.

1502
01:54:01,167 --> 01:54:04,534
- Hi, I'm Cardoso, at your service.
- What do you want?

1503
01:54:04,804 --> 01:54:06,362
- My jacket.
- What?

1504
01:54:06,773 --> 01:54:10,971
Wejust forgot thejacket...
and a beer.

1505
01:54:11,511 --> 01:54:13,035
And the fridge plugged in!

1506
01:54:13,212 --> 01:54:14,577
Plugged in?

1507
01:54:14,947 --> 01:54:17,245
You know, it's a problem
with the fridge.

1508
01:54:17,684 --> 01:54:19,743
- What problem?
- In the motor!

1509
01:54:19,919 --> 01:54:23,377
Cardoso came here to unplug it.
Carefully.

1510
01:54:23,923 --> 01:54:26,858
- Cardoso?
- Yes. Carefully.

1511
01:54:30,730 --> 01:54:34,928
You should unplug it
because it's leaking gas.

1512
01:54:35,101 --> 01:54:41,734
So we came here to get thejacket,
the beer and to unplug the fridge.

1513
01:54:41,908 --> 01:54:43,239
What the hell you're...

1514
01:54:43,409 --> 01:54:47,709
You should actually
call someone to take a look at it.

1515
01:54:47,880 --> 01:54:49,973
- Let's go?
- Let's.

1516
01:54:50,283 --> 01:54:52,877
- Bye, Mr. Antunes.
- Wait, young man!

1517
01:54:53,052 --> 01:54:55,282
When will you
sort out our problem?

1518
01:54:55,455 --> 01:54:58,618
Tomorrow, for sure.
Let's go, Silvia.

1519
01:55:06,099 --> 01:55:08,260
You don't need to wait for me.

1520
01:55:11,471 --> 01:55:14,440
And now, how will you explain the
food inside the washing machine?

1521
01:55:16,542 --> 01:55:18,840
And the chicken?
How will you explain the chicken?

1522
01:55:20,213 --> 01:55:21,612
I won't explain anything.

1523
01:55:25,251 --> 01:55:26,843
I plugged the fridge back in.

1524
01:55:56,816 --> 01:55:58,613
Let's go?

1525
01:56:10,229 --> 01:56:12,026
Besides a chicken,
the police found...

1526
01:56:12,198 --> 01:56:14,928
some of the money stolen from
the bank on Roosevelt Ave.

1527
01:56:15,101 --> 01:56:18,332
"The chicken survived the blast."

1528
01:56:18,738 --> 01:56:20,603
There's more about the chicken
than the dead guy.

1529
01:56:21,541 --> 01:56:23,236
So, do you like it here?

1530
01:56:23,543 --> 01:56:26,205
It's very nice,
but a little crowded.

1531
01:56:26,379 --> 01:56:28,370
And it could have air
conditioning.

1532
01:56:28,681 --> 01:56:31,275
Marinez, are you ever
happy with anything?

1533
01:56:33,419 --> 01:56:37,048
Mom, I put the rent money
in the bank.

1534
01:56:38,891 --> 01:56:43,658
Next week you will be getting
a new TV, like you wanted.

1535
01:56:45,131 --> 01:56:47,031
It's not so cold in Holland.

1536
01:56:47,633 --> 01:56:52,263
I'll be back as soon as I can or
I'll bring you over here. Love.

1537
01:56:53,940 --> 01:56:55,100
Mom...

1538
01:56:55,508 --> 01:56:57,100
I met a girl.

1539
01:56:57,844 --> 01:56:59,505
You'll like her.

1540
01:57:00,279 --> 01:57:01,940
Her name is Silvia.

1541
01:57:03,783 --> 01:57:06,616
My name is Silvia Maria,
but I dropped the Maria.

1542
01:57:07,186 --> 01:57:10,087
You don't know me but maybe
you'll remember my mother.

1543
01:57:10,256 --> 01:57:12,588
Her name was Thelma, with an H.

1544
01:57:12,959 --> 01:57:15,154
She lived in
the Santa Cecilia building.

1545
01:57:15,661 --> 01:57:19,097
My mother told me
that Silvia came from savage.

1546
01:57:19,565 --> 01:57:22,728
And that I was like a shy
wild animal, always hiding.

1547
01:57:23,002 --> 01:57:26,301
And I was always hiding,
until I met Andre.

1548
01:57:28,307 --> 01:57:30,172
The first time I saw Andre...

1549
01:57:30,343 --> 01:57:32,937
he was spying me
from his bedroom window.

1550
01:57:33,613 --> 01:57:36,138
Well, I thought he was,
but I wasn't sure.

1551
01:57:36,816 --> 01:57:38,408
I went to the living room,
in the dark.

1552
01:57:38,584 --> 01:57:41,576
I saw him with binoculars,
looking at my room.

1553
01:57:41,888 --> 01:57:46,325
I got dressed and walked
by my window. Very slowly.

1554
01:57:46,492 --> 01:57:49,017
Then I ran back to the
living room to check.

1555
01:57:49,195 --> 01:57:51,288
He was really spying me.

1556
01:57:52,331 --> 01:57:55,459
The next day I woke up early
and waited for him to come out.

1557
01:57:56,202 --> 01:57:57,999
I thought he was cute.

1558
01:57:58,204 --> 01:57:59,831
I followed him to work.

1559
01:58:00,006 --> 01:58:01,633
I went in, but he didn't see me.

1560
01:58:02,275 --> 01:58:04,766
He draws, he draws really well.

1561
01:58:06,412 --> 01:58:08,312
I've always wanted to go to Rio.

1562
01:58:08,481 --> 01:58:11,678
And it would be nice
to have someone to go with me.

1563
01:58:11,984 --> 01:58:13,451
Traveling alone is boring.

1564
01:58:14,754 --> 01:58:17,416
A few days later I thought
he was following me.

1565
01:58:17,723 --> 01:58:20,089
I ran to catch the bus,
only to make sure.

1566
01:58:20,760 --> 01:58:22,421
And he was.

1567
01:58:22,595 --> 01:58:24,358
I thought he'd speak to me,
but he didn't.

1568
01:58:24,664 --> 01:58:26,791
He followed me to work.

1569
01:58:26,966 --> 01:58:29,161
He waited a while.

1570
01:58:29,335 --> 01:58:31,394
Then he made up a present
for his mother.

1571
01:58:31,570 --> 01:58:33,037
You can pay
with 2 post-dated checks.

1572
01:58:33,205 --> 01:58:36,732
- Really cute.
- Maybe I'll come back. Thank you.

1573
01:58:37,009 --> 01:58:39,500
He said "thank you",
without looking at me.

1574
01:58:40,246 --> 01:58:44,410
I answered "Thank you",
without showing my interest.

1575
01:58:44,750 --> 01:58:46,479
I thought
he'd never show up again.

1576
01:58:46,986 --> 01:58:48,647
Could you pass me the salt?

1577
01:58:50,523 --> 01:58:54,118
I started having lunch near his
work, so that he could follow me.

1578
01:58:54,427 --> 01:58:55,724
- Bye.
- It worked.

1579
01:58:57,363 --> 01:59:00,230
You may find it strange
that I'm telling you all this.

1580
01:59:01,133 --> 01:59:03,124
My mom talked
about you a lot.

1581
01:59:03,602 --> 01:59:06,935
She married Antunes,
I don't think you met him.

1582
01:59:08,007 --> 01:59:10,100
Since she died I've thought
of writing to you.

1583
01:59:10,276 --> 01:59:12,710
But I was little
and I never had the courage.

1584
01:59:14,046 --> 01:59:16,207
She died
when I was 11 years old.

1585
01:59:16,449 --> 01:59:18,610
I was left alone with Antunes
in that house.

1586
01:59:25,391 --> 01:59:28,292
He always told me he
didn't think I was his daughter.

1587
01:59:28,694 --> 01:59:31,959
I prayed that that was true,
I didn't want to be his daughter.

1588
01:59:32,898 --> 01:59:35,992
I took a long time to realize
I had to lock the doors.

1589
01:59:36,635 --> 01:59:37,829
Too long.

1590
01:59:41,173 --> 01:59:44,006
My mother told me that once
you went to Rio together.

1591
01:59:45,144 --> 01:59:46,907
I have a photo of her
on the Corcovado.

1592
01:59:47,079 --> 01:59:48,944
I think it was you
who took the photo.

1593
01:59:51,851 --> 01:59:55,412
If only Andre had money
to take me away to Rio...

1594
01:59:57,156 --> 01:59:59,556
I changed buses
to see if I'd meet him.

1595
02:00:00,326 --> 02:00:01,793
Then a great thing happened.

1596
02:00:02,161 --> 02:00:04,186
Do you want to marry me
and get away from here?

1597
02:00:04,363 --> 02:00:08,163
Andre found a Job, made good money
and asked me to marry him.

1598
02:00:10,036 --> 02:00:11,298
Sure I will.

1599
02:00:21,781 --> 02:00:26,684
We'll arrive in Rio on Sunday
and I wondered if we could meet.

1600
02:00:27,319 --> 02:00:31,346
At noon, on top of the Corcovado,
so we don't miss each other.

1601
02:00:31,757 --> 02:00:34,988
Maybe this sounds strange
to you and you won't show up.

1602
02:00:35,161 --> 02:00:37,686
But my mother always said
you were an artist.

1603
02:00:37,963 --> 02:00:41,490
If she was right, I think
you'll understand my letter.

1604
02:00:43,102 --> 02:00:44,501
Silvia.

1605
02:00:44,970 --> 02:00:46,460
- Paulo?
- Yes!

1606
02:00:51,377 --> 02:00:55,279
You look
just like your mother!

1607
02:00:55,915 --> 02:00:59,544
- Thank God you came.
- Don't say that before Him.

1608
02:01:01,620 --> 02:01:02,746
I'll introduce you.

1609
02:01:02,922 --> 02:01:06,153
This is Andre.
Paulo, my mother's friend.

1610
02:01:06,325 --> 02:01:07,553
Nice to meet you.

1611
02:01:07,726 --> 02:01:09,694
- This is Marinez...
- Hi, Marinez!

1612
02:01:10,896 --> 02:01:13,023
I'm Cardoso, at your service.

1613
02:01:13,265 --> 02:01:14,391
P.S.

1614
02:01:15,734 --> 02:01:18,362
There are a few details
I cannot or will not tell.

1615
02:01:19,371 --> 02:01:20,497
It doesn't matter.

1616
02:01:21,006 --> 02:01:23,201
In a letter
things happen fast.

1617
02:01:23,375 --> 02:01:25,206
Everything seems
to fit together.

1618
02:01:25,377 --> 02:01:27,937
Life is more complicated
than a puzzle.

1619
02:01:28,414 --> 02:01:31,975
But I think that I managed
to tell almost the whole truth.

1620
02:01:32,551 --> 02:01:35,019
And that's enough
to give me some peace.

1621
02:01:35,354 --> 02:01:37,822
Now it seems easier
to understand life.
